# Ideas

NOTE: ratings data is pretty sparse

- trump popularity vs ratings
- comparison of old show to new (classifier internals), quantify how he has changed
- amount of time guest speaks vs he speaks over time
- does he treat different guests differently (republican vs democrat, male vs female)
	- (gender bias) maybe he asks more about SOs to females
	- (liberal bias) definitely exists, how does it manifest and compare across shows
- count applause and laughter vs ratings
- compare across other late night shows based on any measure
- categorize types of guests and look at historgram
- look at popularity or networth of guests and see if it correlates with ratings
- create markov bot of colbert speach
