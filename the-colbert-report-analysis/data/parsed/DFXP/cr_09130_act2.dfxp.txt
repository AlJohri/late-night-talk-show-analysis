WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT ARE AN INDY  FOLK BAND BEST KNOWN FOR THEIR  SONG HO, HEY. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH A SONG  BY ELLIOTT SPITZER, HEY, HO. PLEASE WELCOME TO LUMINEERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU. HERE WE GO. WE HAVE WESLEY SHULTZ. WE HAVE NEYLA PEKAREK AND  JONATHAN FRAITES.
CLOSE, JEREMIAH FRAITES  Stephen: HOW CAN YOU FORGET A  NAME LIKE THAT? YOU SOUND LIKE THE MAIN  CHARACTER FROM A STEINBACH  NOVEL. THE MAN WHO IS WALKING ALL THE  WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TELLS  THE WOMAN HE LOVES HER BUT HE DIES OF CHOLERA. YOU GUYS, YOU TWO ARE FROM NEW  JERSEY. THAT TRUE?
YEAH  Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU FROM? DISWROO DENVER
Stephen: YOU'RE THE ONE WHO  DREW THEM OUT TO DENVER BECAUSE  YOU GUYS WERE IN BROOKLYN AND THEN YOU WENT TO DENVER FROM  BROOKLYN. WAS THERE NOT ENOUGH POT IN  BROOKLYN? YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO GO TO DENVER  WHERE IT'S LEGAL.
NOT SO MUCH FOR THE  VEGETATION SELECTION THERE. IT WAS MORE ABOUT CHEAPER RENT  TO BE HONEST. WE JUST WANTED ELIMINATE MORE  DISTRACTIONS
Stephen: BILLINGS MONTANA  EVEN CHEAPER THAN DENVER. WHAT DREW YOU TO DENVER.
A COUPLE OF FRIENDS MOVING  INTO A HOUSE. THEY HAD ENOUGH ROOM FOR US TO  HAVE A PRACTICE BASE AND LIVE  THERE. IT WAS HALF THE AMOUNT I WAS  SPENDING IN BROOKLYN. I THINK IT WAS BASICALLY A  FINANCIAL REASON TO MOVE. JUST TO HAVE MORE TIME TO PLAY  THE MUSIC
Stephen: YOUR FIRST ALBUM  SOLD A MILLION COPIES, RIGHT?
I CAN MOVE BACK THERE NOW. Stephen: WHY NOT? I KNOW FOLK SINGER LANGUAGE.
YEAH. I MEAN WE COULD. I LIKE DENVER THOUGH.
Stephen: THERE'S NO REASON  NOT TO. NO REASON NOT TO. YOUR FAMILY MUST BE VERY HAPPY.
DEFINITELY. WE'RE NEVER HOME ANYMORE. NO, WE TRAVEL A LOT. I THINK AS AMUSE I CANNIAN YOU  HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF IT AWAY  FROM HOME.
THEY'RE PROBABLY UPSET WITH  IT. IN THE MIDDLE OF A TOUR SHE GOT  OFFERED A TEACHING POSITION
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF  TEACHING.
I GOT MY DEGREE IN MUSIC  EDUCATION. I GOT OFFERED TO BE A MIDDLE  SCHOOL BAND TEACHER.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD  DEFINITELY DO IT. THOSE KIDS WILL BE SO... CAN YOU  IMAGINE? OR AT LEAST SUBSTITUTE TEACH. WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?
IT WAS A PERFECT JOB TO HAVE  WHILE WE TOURED. I COULD WORK AS MANY DAYS AS I  WANTED IN THE SCHOOL YEAR.
WE HAD A LIVING ROOM FROM  MARCH TWO YEARS AGO.
Stephen: WHAT? IN THE LIVING ROOM.
IS IS THAT RIGHT? Stephen: OH, HERE. YOU HAD A RESIDENCY IN SOMEONE'S  LIVING ROOM. THAT'S SUPER FOLK OWE.
I GOT MY INTERNSHIP IN  SOMEONE'S BROOM CLOSET.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU STOMP AND  CLAP SO MUCH BECAUSE YOU DO. YOU DO. HEY. IS THAT ALWAYS UNDER YOUR  CONTROL?
IT JUST COMES OUT OF ME. WE USED TO PLAY LIVING ROOMS  LIKE WE WERE JUST ACTUAL LIVING  ROOMS.
Stephen: THAT WASN'T THAT FAR  OFF THE MARK.
YEAH. THERE WAS NO MICROPHONES SO  BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU HAD TO MAKE  A LOT OF NOISE TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION SO THAT THEY WOULD  STOP...
Stephen: THEY KNEW YOU WERE  THERE, RIGHT? GET THAT DUDE'S ATTENTION OVER  THERE.
WITH A SONG LIKE HO HEY IT'S  MORE MUSICAL. IF YOU DROVE 14 HOURS FROM L.A. UP TO PORTLAND AND YOU HAVE 35  MINUTES TO MAKE YOUR MARK AND  YOU'RE LOSING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN GAS AND SORT OF YOUR  LAST-DITCH EFFORT, WE WOULD GO  INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SET UP TABLES AND WE WOULD SCREAM HO  HEY AT PEOPLE
Stephen: STOMPING YOUR FEET  WAS REALLY AS MUCH OF AS A  TANTRUM AS ANYTHING ELSE. WOULD YOU STOMP AND CLAP FOR US.
SURE. tephen: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANKS FOR HAVING US. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK  WITH A PERFORMANCE BY THE
