Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, YOU KNOW THE OLD  SAYING, IT'S NOT ABOUT  WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE,  IT'S ABOUT WHETHER I WIN AND YOU LOSE. BUT SOMETIMES I DON'T GET  FIRST PLACE OR A GOLD MEDAL  OR CHAMPION HOG AT THE  KANSAS STATE FAIR. I TOTALLY OWNED YOU HANDS  SOLO. SPENT A YEAR GETTING MARBLES  FOR NOTHING. WELL, FOLKSING I'M SAD TO  SAY IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS IS WHO'S NOT HONORING  ME NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, WHO COULD FORGET  LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS NAMED  MAXIM MAGAZINE'S 6 --th HOTTEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD. -- 69th. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SOME SAY IT WAS  INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO SHOW  FULL FRONTAL THUMB BUT I SAY IF YOU GOT IT, FLAUNT IT. WELL, ONCE AGAIN MAXIM HAS  DISPATCHED THEIR CRACK  TREATMENT OF CRACK  INSPECTORS AND THE RESULTS ARE IN FOR 2013.
MILY CYRUS IS NUMBER ONE  ON THE MAXIM MAGAZINE HOT  100 LIST. MILEY ACTUALLY BEAT OUT  JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT AND  RIHANNA FOR THE HOT HONORS. SO CRAZY MILEY SAYS IN THE  100 ISSUE.
MILY CYRUS IS LOVELY BUT  IF ARE YOU GIVING OUT  HOTNESS HONORS TO A DISNEY STAR, I WOULD GO WITH WALT'S  FAVORITE GIRL, LENNY  RIESENTHAL. SO MAYBE I DIDN'T GET NUMBER  ONE. I WOULD SETTLE FOR NUMBER  TWO OR EVEN NUMBER 8. BUT FOLKS I WENT OUT AND I  BOUGHT SOME MAGAZINE, AND  AFTER THREE HOURS OF  SCOURING THE PAGES IN A LOCKED ROOM, I WAS NOWHERE  TO BE FOUND.
BOOO!
Stephen: YOU WERE A  LITTLE LATE THERE. (LAUGHTER)  AND I KNOW WHAT THIS IS,  THIS IS AGE DISCRIMINATION. LAST YEAR I'M HOT THIS YEAR  I'M NOT. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA--   (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW  HARD IT IS TO STAY YOUNG AND  FIRM? I HAVE HAD SO MUCH FAT FROM  MY ASS INJECT MOOD MY FACE  THAT MY DENTIST IS A  PROCTOLOGIST. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THIS IS A DISGRACE, MAXIM. YOU'RE SENDING A HORRIBLE  MESSAGE TO AMERICA'S YOUNG  MALES THAT ONE YEAR THEY  COULD BE ONE OF THE HOTTEST WOMEN ON THE PLANET AND THE  NEXT YEAR POOF. NOTHING. BY THE WAY, POOF-- IS WHAT I  SAY TO GET MY POUTY HOT FACE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHO AM I KIDDING? I'M JUST A WITHERED OLD  COUGAR. I JUST-- I DON'T KNOW, I  JUST WANT TO BE OBJECT FIND  LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? AND JUST LOOK AT THE HOT  YOUNG THING WHO TOOK MY SPOT  THIS YEAR'S MAGAZINE AT  NUMBER 69. MANTEI TE'O'S FAKE  GIRLFRIEND. I'M SORRY. MI SORRY, MAXIM, BUT I AM  WAIT HOTTER THAN HER. HAVE YOU SEEN HER? NEITHER HAS HE. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN HOW DARE-- HOW DARE  MAXIM GIVE AWAY MY HARD  EARNED SPOT TO SOME FAKE PERSONA THAT DOESN'T EVEN  EXIST? INSTEAD OF A GENUINE PERSON  LIKE STEPHEN COLBERT. NOW FOLKS, DON'T KID  YOURSELF--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND DON'T KID  YOURSELF, FOLKS, THIS  TOTALLY CHANGES THE GAME. DON'T GET TOO COMFY MILEY  CYRUS BECAUSE THE FAKE  PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE, NEXT  YEAR'S TOP SPOT COULD BE EVERYONE'S CANADIAN  GIRLFRIEND. WILL YOU NEVER SEE HER  COMING. SHE IS A MODEL BUT SHE CAN'T  COME DOWN BECAUSE HER  PARENTS HAVE A FARM AND SHE  HAS TO WORK THIS SUMMER. AND MAXIM, I WILL NOT TAKE  THIS LYING DOWN. UNLESS THAT'S WHAT YOUR  PHOTOGRAPHER WANTS. IN WHICH CASE-- I'M WILLING  TO WAX EVERYWHERE. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
