( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALIST  AND FORMER MARINE WHO SENT THE  LAST YEAR IN SYRIA. THAT'S ROUGH-- MISSING THE LAST  SEASON OF "DOWNTON ABBEY."  PLEASE WELCOME C.J. CHIVERS. BESIDES THE FACT YOU'RE THE  AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "THE GUN"  ABOUT THE AK-47, MOST DURABLE MACHINE EVER MADE BY MANKIND,  PROBABLY-- KILLING MACHINE AT  LEAST. YOU'RE ALSO THE GUY FROM THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" WHO SHOWS UP ON  THE COVER HERE SAYING-- IN SYRIA, CLASH OVER HIGHWAY A  BITTERLY PERSONAL WAR BY C.J. CHIVERS. I SEE YOUR NAME THERE. ARE YOU THE ONLY TIME IN THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" ON THE GROUND  THERE IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW?
AT THE MOMENT I AM.
Stephen:  WHAT DO I NEED TO  KNOW ABOUT SYRIA THAT I'M NOT  LEARNING BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF COVERAGE OF SYRIA IN THE  MAINSTREAM PRESS BECAUSE IT'S A  BUMMER.
IN HUMAN TERMS IT'S A SORROW. AND THE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW  PROBABLY FOR STARTERS ARE THE  HUMAN TERMS. WE'RE TALKING SOMETHING LIKE  100,000 PEOPLE KILLED SO FAR IN  THE CONFLICT, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DISPLACED IN A COUNTRY THAT IS  SYSTEMATICALLY, ECONOMICALLY,  PHYSICALLY, SOCIALLY BE  DESTROYED.
Stephen:  SHOULD WE BE  THERE WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND?
THE SYRIANS WOULD LIKE SOSEE  US THERE.
Stephen:  WHO THE SYRIANS  O'ER THE ASSAD REBELS WHY DON'T  THE SYRIANS LOOK ACROSS THE BORDER TO THE STABLE, DEMOCRATIC  REGIME IN IRAQ? ( LAUGHTER )  THAT WE ESTABLISHED AS A MODEL  FOR THE ENTIRE REGION TO SPREAD  PEACE.
OH, I THINK WHAT YOU'RE  SEEING IS THE SYRIANS AND IRAQIS  ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE BORDER AT EACH OTHERRAND IN SOME WAYS  THEY'RE ALREADY INVOLVED IN THE  SAME WAR.
Stephen:  HOW SO?
THIS STARTED OUT AS A POPULAR  UPRISING IN THE SPIRIT OF MUCH  OF THE ARAB SPRING-- PEACEFUL PROTESTS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. IT MET AN INTENSIVE ARMED  CRACKDOWN, WHICH IN SOME WAYS  PROVOKED THE CIVIL WAR THAT YOU SEE NOW. AND THAT WAR HAS TAKEN A  SECTARIAN CHARACTER WHICH  EXTENDS-- WE'RE SEEING MORE  VIOLENCE ALONG SECTARIAN LINES REIGNITED IN IRAQ.
Stephen:  SO ASSAD AND HIS  BUDDIES, THEY'RE SHE ARIGHT? BUT THE POPULATION IS  ESSENTIALLY SUNNI.
IN THE MAIN, THE POPULATION  IS SUNNI. AND MOST OF THE OPPOSITION IS  SUNNI.
Stephen:  AS AN AMERICAN  HOW MUCH LONGER DO I HAVE TO  KNOW THOSE THINGS? BECAUSE I NEVER WANTED TO KNOW  THAT STUFF. ( LAUGHTER )  I'M A CATHOLIC. I'M NOT A MUSLIM, AND I DON'T  REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR LITTLE  FIGHTS OVER THERE. HOW LONG AM I GOING TO HAVE TO  CARE ABOUT FIGHTS IN THE MIDDLE  EAST AS AN AMERICAN?
I THINK THIS FIGHT IS GOING  TO GO ON FAIR LONG TIME AND  YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO CARE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE  REGIONAL STANLEY.
Stephen:  HOW DOES THE  UNITED STATES MAKE THE BEST OF A  SITUATION FOR OUR OWN NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST?
CHOOSE A POLICY. IT'S NOT CLEARRTO US WHO WATCH  CLOSELY WHAT THE UNITED STATES  WANTS TO HAVE HAPPEN AND WHAT IT IT IS DOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
Stephen:  OBAMA DREW THE  RED LINE ABOUT CHEMICAL WEAPONS  AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE USED AND WE'RE NOT GOING IN.
ARE YOU SURE CHEMICAL WEAPONS  WERE USED.
Stephen:  I SAW IT ON FOX  NEWS.
I'M NOT SURE CHEMICAL WEAPONS  WERR USED. CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS PROBABLY ONE  SET OF LENSES TO LOOK AT THIS  WAR, AND FOR SOME REASON WE'RE USING THAT AS A TRIGGER IN THE  WEST FOR WHETHER OR NOT WE  SHOULD GET INVOLVED. IT'S NOT THE BEST SET OF LENSES  FOR LOOKING AT THE WAR. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE  BEEN KILLED IN THE WAR BY  CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS. THE DWENGZAL WEAPONS IS WAIT THE  WAR IS PLAYING OUT EACH DAY AND  IS RUINING THE COUNTRY.
Stephen:  NOW, YOU'RE HERE  NOW ASY I SAD, BUT YOU'RE A DAD  WHO LIVES IN RHODE ISLAND,  RIGHT?
AM I.
Stephen:  WHEN ARE YOU  GOING BACK?
SOON.
Stephen:  HOW LONG WILL YOU  THERE ABOUT?
WE'LL BE THERE ABOUT A WEEK.
Stephen:  HOW IS THE  DAMASCUS HYATT, IS IT NICE?
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE YET. I GO IN AND WORK WITH THE REBELS  SO WE GO IN FROM THE TURKISH  SIDE TYPICALLY AND WE  RAVEL WITH SLEEPING BAGS WITH THE  REBELS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND  COME OUT.
Stephen:  YOU WERE A  MARINE, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
Stephen:  WHEN THESE REBELS  ARE ABOUT TO GO ON AN OPERATION,  DO YOU EVER SAY, "HEY, GUYS, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THOSE TACTICS  ARE GOOD OR BAD, BUT I'M GOING  TO BE REPORTING FROM BEHIND THAT WALL OVER THERE."
YOU KNOW, I GET IN THAT  SITUATION A LOT WHERE YOU SEE  THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT YOU PROBABLY WOULD PREFER NOT TO  HAPPEN ON THE TACTICAL SIDE, OR  THE USE OF WEAPONS, AND I USUALLY DON'T SAY ANYTHING  WHATSOEVER. WE'RE THERE TO OBSERVE. WE'RE NOT ADVISERS. WE'RE NOT COMBATANTS AND WE  OBSERVE AND GO WITH THEM, FOR  THE BETTER OR WORSE.
Stephen:  IF SOMEONE WAS  LOOKING AT HOW CLOSE YOU WERE  STANDING TO THE REBELS THEY'D GET A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT YOU  THOUGHT OF THEIR TACTICS?
THEY MIGHT. THERE ARE SOME REBELS-- PEOPLE  --
Stephen:  C.J. DOESN'T LIKE  THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. STAY SAFE, PLEASE. C.J. CHIVERS. THE "NEW YORK TIMES."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
