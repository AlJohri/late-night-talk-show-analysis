STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. THANKS SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M NO FAN OF KOREAN DICTATOR AND EVIL POTATO KIM JONG UN. I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE ABOUT THIS MAN'S SICK AFFECTION FOR THINGS LIKE INDUSTRIAL LUBRICANT AND MUSHROOMS. FOR THOSE WITHOUT HIGH DEF TVS, KIM'S THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW, THE "UN"-THINKABLE HAS "KIM "-- HAPPENED.
NORTH KOREA'S LEADER HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC FOR THREE WEEKS. STATE TV REPORTS KIM JONG UN IS SUFFERING FROM DISCOMFORT.
SOME ARE SPECULATING THE 31-YEAR-OLD IS SUFFERING FROM SOME SORT OF HEALTH PROBLEM ACCORDING TO HIS WEIGHT GAIN AS WELL AS A RECENT LIMP.
THE BRILLIANT COMRADE, AS HE IS KNOWN, HAS GOUT, WHICH IS CAUSED BY TOO MUCH BOOZE AND RICH FOOD.
STEPHEN: WHICH HAS THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA IN A STATE OF UTTER CONFUSION BECAUSE THEIR LANGUAGE HAS NO WORD FOR "TOO MUCH FOOD." (LAUGHTER) AND KIM-WATCHERS LIKE ME KNOW WHAT FOOD HE'S TOO-MUCHING OF.
NORTH KOREAN LEADER IS PUTTING HIS HEALTH AT SERIOUS RISK DUE TO DANGEROUSLY HIGH CONSUMPTION OF CHEESE.
THE 31-YEAR-OLD HAS PACKED ON A LOT OF WEIGHT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF IMPORTED SWISS CHEESE HE KEEPS EATING.
THE DICTATOR IS APPARENTLY OBSESSED WITH CHEESE. THERE'S WORD HE FELL IN LOVE WITH SWISS CHEESE WHEN HE STUDIED IN SWITZERLAND.
STEPHEN: YES, SWITZER-LAND. (LAUGHTER) KIM'S MASSIVE CHEESE CONSUMPTION IS ALL THE MORE AMAZING WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT NORTH KOREA HAS YET TO ACHIEVE CRACKER TECHNOLOGY. (LAUGHTER) KIM'S FAVORITE CHEESE IS "EMMENTAL, A CHEESE MADE IN SWITZERLAND." YOU CAN TELL IT'S SWISS BECAUSE IT TASTES NEUTRAL, AND THE HOLES CAN BE USED FOR STORING NAZI GOLD. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE KIM IS -- REALLY? YOU'RE NAZI GOLD FANS? (LAUGHTER) REALLY? DON'T TEASE HIM ABOUT THE NAZI GOLD! WHERE WERE THE NAZIS SUPPOSED TO PUT IT? YOU'RE SO HARD ON THE NAZIS, STEPHEN. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. AND NOW -- AND NOW -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY LOST THE WAR. ISN'T THAT BAD ENOUGH? (LAUGHTER) AND NOW -- AND NOW -- AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE KIM IS ABOUT TO BE DAIRY UNHAPPY. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG UN WILL NOT BE GETTING TOP-QUALITY CHEESE ANYTIME SOON. THE HEAD OF ONE OF FRANCE'S FAMOUS CHEESE-MAKING SCHOOLS SAYS NORTH KOREA APPROACHED HER LAST MONTH ASKING IF SOME OF LIL' KIM'S PEOPLE COULD TRAIN AT THE FACILITY. SHE SAYS SHE POLITELY TURNED THEM DOWN.
STEPHEN: GEE, KIM. I KNOW WE ARE SWORN ENEMIES, BUT STILL, I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL BAD THAT SOMEONE HAS CUT YOUR CHEESE. (LAUGHTER) ESPECIALLY SINCE, HERE IN AMERICA, CHEESE IS EVERYWHERE! WE HAVE BLOCKS OF CHEESE, STRINGS OF CHEESE, DOODLES OF CHEESE, CREAMS OF CHEESE, CANS OF CHEESE, FOUNTAINS OF CHEESE, CAKES OF CHEESE, AND "IT'S" OF CHEESE. ON SUNDAYS, AMERICANS WATCH SPORTS WHILE EATING CHEESE BALLS AND WEARING CHEESE HATS, AND THE NEXT DAY AT WORK WE DISCUSS THE GAME WHILE GATHERING AROUND THE CHEESE COOLER. (LAUGHTER) HEY, WHAT'S THIS? OH, IT'S THE REST OF MY LUNCH, A 20-POUND WEDGE OF EMMENTAL CHEESE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MM-MMM! MM-MMM! OH, YEAH! GUESS I'LL HAVE TO FINISH IT. MMM! (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) TASTES LIKE FREEDOM. (LAUGHTER) MMM. GETTING A BIG OL' KNOT OF LIBERTY IN MY CHEST. SO KIM JONG UN,  AMERICA'S MORTAL ENEMY, IF YOU EVER WANT SOME EMMENTAL, JUST COME TO NEW YORK. I'LL HAVE A DELICIOUS BLOCK WAITING FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
