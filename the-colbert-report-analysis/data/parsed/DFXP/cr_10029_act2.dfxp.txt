(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH! FOLKS, YOU KNOW NOW THAT THANKSGIVING HAS COME AND GONE IT MEANS WE'RE TWO-THIRDS THE WAY THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. BUT THERE'S STILL TIME FOR THE SECULAR CHRISTMAS HATERS OUT THERE TO MOUNT THEIR OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE BABY JESUS. BUT THIS YEAR BABY J'S GOT BACKUP. THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON GRINCHITUDE.

Stephen: NATION, IF YOU KNOW YOUR BIBLE I'M SURE YOU'RE A FAMILIAR WITH THE PARABLE OF HOW ERNEST SAVED CHRISTMAS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE VAT CANT IS DRAGGING ITS FEET ON MAKING THIS MAN A SAINT. IN FACT, SAVING CHRISTMAS IS SOMETHING OF A CHRISTMAS TRADITION BUT THIS YEAR CHRISTMAS IS RETURNING THE FAVOR BECAUSE LAST WEEK A CHRISTMAS TREE SAVED A FAMILY FROM A BULLET. (LAUGHTER)
A FAMILY'S HOUSE WAS HIT BY A STRAY BULLET DURING A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING. ONE FAMILY SAYS THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT WORSE IF IT WEREN'T FOR WHERE THE CHRISTMAS TREE WAS.
WELL I WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH RIGHT THERE AND I HEARD SIX, EIGHT LOUD POPS. IF THE TREE WASN'T HERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD THE COUCH RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE WINDOWS.
Stephen: WHAT AN INSPIRING ACT OF COURAGE. (LAUGHTER) BY SILENTLY VOLUNTEERING TO BE PUT WHERE THE COUCH HAD BEEN THE TREE PLACED ITSELF IN THE LINE OF FIRE AND WHEN THE SHOOTING BEGAN, THE TREE DIDN'T HESITATE TO NOT MOVE. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IT WAS JUST A MONTH AWAY FROM RETIRING. NOW, AUTHORITIES SAY THE TREE WILL RECOVER FROM THE BULLET BUT PROBABLY NOT BEING CHOPPED OFF BY THE ROOTS AND DRAG INDOORS. (LAUGHTER) BUT I SAY IF OUR CHRISTMAS TREES ARE WILLING TO SHOW THIS KIND OF BRAVERY, LET'S AT LEAST MAKE IT A FAIR FIGHT. TIME TO GET RID OF THE ONEROUS GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS PREVENTING TREES FROM HAVING GUNS. (LAUGHTER) NOW, INEVITABLY, YES, A TREE HERE OR THERE WILL GO CRAZY AND TURN ITS ORNAMENTS ON THE FAMILY, BUT IT'S NOT THE GUNS' FAULT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE TREES GET THE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. BESIDES, NO ONE SHOULD GET HURT AS LONG AS NO ONE BREAKS INTO THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SAY DOWN A CHIMNEY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
