Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS SITTING OVER THERE. I SHOULD GO TALK TO HIM. PLEASE WELCOME A. SCOTT BERG! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO! I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO PSYCHE YOU OUT THERE. SOMETIMES THEY DESERVE DOUBLE DIPS OVER THERE. THIS IS A GREAT CROWD TONIGHT. SIR, YOU'RE AWE PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR.
I AM.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT LINDBERG AND KATHARINE HEPBURN. YOU HAVE A NEW ONE HERE. IT'S CALLED "WILSON--" THIS IS WOODROW WILSON, RIGHT?
IT IS WOODROW WILSON.
Stephen:  WHY WILSON? WERE ALL THE GOOD PRESIDENTS TAKEN AT THIS POINT? WHY NOT POLK OR BUCHANAN.
ALL EXCEPT THE BEST PRESIDENT.
Stephen:  WILSON, WOODROW WILSON.
I THINK HE'S THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURE OF THE 20th CENTURY.
Stephen:  HITLER WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL, TOO, SIR. WAS HE THE BEST PRESIDENT GERMANY EVER HAD?
SOME SAY.
Stephen:  SOME SAY? REALLY, REALLY, A. SCOTT BERG? WHAT DOES THE "A" STAND FOR, ADOLF?
"A" STANDS FOR ANDREW. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUTED WITH ROW. THIS IS A MAN WHO CREATED A DOMESTIC AGENDA WE STILL LIVE WITH TODAY, EIGHT-HOUR WORK DAYS, WOMEN WITH THE VOTE.
Stephen:  OF COURSE THEY HAD EIGHT-HOUR WORK DAYS IN 1913. THEY DIDN'T HAVE 5 HOUR ENERGY BACK THEN. THEY COULDN'T HACK IT LIKE WE CAN NOW.
TRUE ENOUGH. AND ALL OUR FOREIGN POLICY TODAY, FOR GOOD OR FOR BAD, COMES FROM WOODROW WILSON.
Stephen:  HOW ABOUT FOR THE BAD? ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH WILSON-- HE'S A PROGRESSIVE. HE IS THE FIRST GREAT PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT.
HE IS, AND GOT ELECTED TWICE FOR IT.
Stephen:  HE RAN THE FIRST TIME SAYING HE WAS GOING TO KEEP US OUT OF WORLD WAR I. THEN GOT RE-ELECTED AND BROUGHT INTOWS WORLD WAR I. ( LAUGHTER )
HE REALIZED HE HAD TO DO THAT.
Stephen:  UH-HUH, HE HAD TO LIE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
HE WAS --
Stephen:  ADMIT, HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
NO, HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.
Stephen:  SEE, I'M A KAISER FAN. I'M A KAISER FAN. SERIOUSLY. HISTORICALLY GERM AN-- YOU'RE SAYING THAT-- YOU'RE SAYING THE KAISER SHOULD NOT HAVE RESPOND FORWARD THE ASSASSINATION OF FRANZ FERDINAND? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? THAT'S APPEASEMENT.
NO, NO, HE SHOULD RESPOND. THE QUESTION WAS, WHAT SHOULD THE UNITED STATES DO ABOUT IT?
Stephen:  WELL THE UNITED STATES WENT IN TO FIGHT FOR THE FROGS AND THE LIMEYS. THAT'S WHAT WE DID. WORLD WAR II, GREAT WAR. WORLD WAR I, HUGE MISTAKE.
WELL-- WELL.
--
Stephen:  AND WILSON GOT US IN.
HE DID GET US IN. HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A MORAL COMPONENT THAT SHOULD BE PART OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.
Stephen:  TOW DESTROY GERMANY SO HITLER WOULD COME TO POWER?
NEGOTIATE THE IDEA WAS TO LOOK AFTER THE LITTLE NATIONS AND THE NATION BEING PICKED ON. AND WILSON FELT THAT WITH GREATNESS, SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES HAD, COMES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY.
Stephen:  HERE'S MY BIGGEST PROBLEM. LET'S PUT FOREIGN POLICY ASPIEPPED LET'S TALK DOMESTIC. THIS IS THE BASTARD WHO STARTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHO PUSHED FOR A GRADUATED INCOME TAX. HOW YOU CAN POSSIBLY DEFEND A MAN WHO STARTED THE FED-- WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY THE ILLUMINATI, AND AN INCOME TAX-- THIS IS THE GUY WHO IS CRIPPLING US WITH PRINTED MONEY.
WELL --
Stephen:  THANK YOU, THANK YOU. A MEMBER OF THE BULL MOOSE PARTY STILL HERE. ( LAUGHTER ).
WOODROW WILSON, THIS IS A MAN WHO WANTED TO LEVEL THE PLAYING DISPEELD HE THOUGHT THIS WAS A WAY TO DO IT. HE THOUGHT THIS WAS A WAY TO MAKE A FAIRER COUNTRY.
Stephen:  THAT'S CALLED REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
IT IS JUST THAT.
Stephen:  THAT'S CLASS WARFARE.
IT IS.
Stephen:  THAT'S CLASS TRENCH WARFARE. YEAH. DO YOU THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING FOR HIM TO DO?
THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER I THINK THAT.
Stephen:  IT'S YOUR BOOK. IT'S YOUR BOOK.
WELL --
Stephen:  I ALREADY SAID IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IF YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO I WILL WIN EVERY ARGUMENT.
I WANT READERS TO COME TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSION.
Stephen:  WHAT KIND OF A BOOK IS THAT.
IT'S A THINK FOR YOURSELF KIND OF BOOK. BOOK.
Stephen:  A THINK FOR YOURSELF KIND OF BOOK. OKAY, WILSON ALSO TRIED TO GET US INTO THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
HE DID.
Stephen:  THAT'S THE PROTOLIKE BABY STEP UNITED NATIONS.
IT IS.
Stephen:  HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE UP AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY, ALSO.
WOULDN'T SAY HE WANTED TO GO THAT FAR.
Stephen:  OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T. YOU LIKED HIM. HE BELIEVED WE SHOULD BE TBHORK CONS CONCERT WITH OTHER NATIONS.
HE DID. HE HAD A VERY STRANGE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD ALL SIT DOWN AT A TABLE BEFORE WE GO TO WAR AND MAYBE WE COULD STOP IT BEFORE THE WAR BREAKS OUT. THAT WAS HIS NOTION.
Stephen:  WHAT WAS THIS GUY'S DISPEERNS BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
WELL, IT WAS ACADEMIA. HE WAS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND THEN A COLLEGE PRESIDENT.
Stephen:  IVORY TOWER.
WELL, EXCEPT, EVEN THERE, HE WAS TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD WITHIN THE IVORY TOWER. HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT LESS OF AN IVORY TOWER.
Stephen:  WHAT SCHOOL DID HE GO IT?
THAT WAS PRINCETON UNIVERSITY.
Stephen:  PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. HAS IT LEVELED OUT SINCE THEN.
EVERY SMART MAN AND SMART WOMAN.
Stephen:  CAN GUTO PRINCETON?
YES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  I LIKE YOUR STYLE. WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE LASTING LEGACY OF WILSON? IS THERE ANYTHING IN OBAMA THAT WE SEE FROM WILSON?
WELL I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE SEE IN OBAMA, ALTHOUGH I THINK HE COULD TAKE A FEW PAGES OUT OF OF THE WILSON PLAYBOOK, AND THAT IS HAVE MORE OF A CONVERSATION WITH THE CONGRESS AND WITH THE COUNTRY FOR THAT MATTER.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND THAT WILSON ACTUALLY PUT THE IDEA OF NATIONALIZED HEALTH CARE ON THE TABLE 100 YEARS AGO.
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT FIRST CAME UP.
Stephen:  SO, REALLY, OBAMACARE IS A DISCUSSION THAT STARTED 100 YEARS AGO.
ALMOST EVERY PROGRESSIVE IDEA CAME UP WITH WOODROW WILSON.
Stephen:  WHAT WAS WILSON'S BALMCARE WEB SITE LIKE? WAS IT ANY BETTER BACK IN 1913? I THINK AT THIS POINT, STEAM POWER MIGHT BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE.
I THINK IT WORKED BETTER, BUT YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS FIXED. I THINK. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  WELL, WE SHALL SEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. A. SCOTT BERG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE BOOK IS "WILSON." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
