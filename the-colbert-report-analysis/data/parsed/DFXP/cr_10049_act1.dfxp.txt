TONIGHT NEW ADVANCES IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. WHEN WILL THEY FINALLY FIND A VACCINE AGAINST LETHAL INJECTION. THEN HOW TO BECOME A SAINT. YOU'LL NEED A LEPER, A SPARE ARM AND HOT GLUE GUN. AND MY GUEST JOURNALIST SCOTT STOSSEL SAYS WORRIERS ARE WINNERS. OH MAN,  I DON'T KNOW IF I'M A WINNER. WHICH MEANS I AM. KRAFT HAS RECALLED OVER 1.7 MILLION POUNDS OF VELVEETA PRODUCTS  FOR MISLABELED INGREDIENTS. THEY ACCIDENTALLY CALLED IT CHEESE. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. [THEME SONG PLAYS] [THEME SONG PLAYS]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE STUFF OF LIFE. STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ALREADY. BECAUSE I CERTAINLY HOPE ALL OF YOU HAD A GREAT WEEKEND. I FOR ONE AM STILL RECOVERING FROM YESTERDAY'S NFL PLAY-OFF ACTION. I WATCHED SO MUCH FOOTBALL YESTERDAY I GOT A CONTACT CONCUSSION. CONCUSSION. BUT NOW WE KNOW WHO'S GOING TO THE BIG SHOW, THE BIG DANCE, THE RODEO MASS GRANDE. IT'S GOING TO FEATURE NEW ENGLAND...FACE KITES, NFC CHAMP THE SEATTLE SADBIRDS VERSUS THE AFC CHAMPS THE DENVER HORSE GHOSTS, WHO LAST NIGHT DEFEATED THE NEW ENGLAND FACE KITES-- NEW ENGLAND COULD NOT RESPOND TO DENVER'S BOLD STRATEGY OF SCORING MORE POINTS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT A PERFORMANCE BY PEYTON MANNING, THE DENVER'S QB OR QUICK BOY. WHO THIS SEASON HAS SET A LEAGUE RECORD FOR SCREAMING THE WORD OMAHA. OMAHA! OMAHA! OMAHA! OMAHA!
EVERY TIME HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY A GROUP OF COMPANIES IN OMAHA NEBRASKA DONATED $800 TO MANNING'S FOUNDATION FOR AT RISK YOUTH. HE SAID IT 31 TIMES. THAT IS $24,800.
Stephen: FOLKS, IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY TO OMAHA BUSINESSES BECAUSE ACCORDING TO HOTELS.COM, SEARCHES FOR HOTELS IN NEBRASKA'S LARGEST CITY INCREASED 21% SINCE LAST SUNDAY'S GAME.
FOLKS, THAT'S HOW I PLAN ALL MY FAMILY'S VACATIONS, I TURN ON THE TV AND I BOOK TICKETS FOR THE FIRST CITY I HEAR SOMEONE SHOUT. (LAUGHTER) AND SINCE I WATCH NOTHING FOX NEWS, KIDS, GET READY FOR SPRING BREAK IN BENGHAZI. NOW FOLKS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FOLKS, WHAT REALLY PINCHES MY PIGSKIN IS THAT BOTH OF THESE TEAMS HAIL FROM THE STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL USE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) UNLIKE OTHER STATES WHICH HAVE LEGALIZED MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL USE. NATION, POT AND FOOTBALL DO NOT MIX. THEY ARE LIKE OIL AND WATER OR BASEBALL AND EXCITEMENT. (LAUGHTER) AND ONCE THE NFL STARTS CATERING TO THESE TEAMS, DOOBIE TOKING FANS FOOTBALL WILL BE RUINED, JUST LIKE POT HEADS RUINED LASER ZEPPELIN IT USED TO BE ABOUT THE LOVE OF LASER. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT ALL THE SUPER BOWL COMMERCIALS ARE GOING TO BE FOR MUNCHIES AND ALL THE ADS ARE GOING TO HAVE FREAKY TALKING BABIES AND ANIMALS. I SAY SAVE IT FOR THE COMMERCIALS AT BURNING MAN, YA HIPPIES. AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO THE ALL AMERICAN HALFTIME SHOWS, INSTEAD, THEY'LL JUST PUT A TWO HOUR HEYAO MIYAZAKE MOVIE UP ON THE JUMBOTRON. WOW, I GOT TO SAY, STEVEN TYLER LOOKS GREAT. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW AND I HOPE YOU DO, YOU KNOW THAT I SUPPORT THE DEATH PENALTY. THE ANCIENT BABYLONIANS HAD IT RIGHT, AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH. WHICH MEANS YOU OWE ME TWO MOLARS DR. BRILLSTEIN. [LAUGHTER] BUT SUDDENLY, KILLING PRISONERS IS NOT AS EASY AS YOU'D HOPE. THE DRUGS USED IN THE 32 DEATH PENALTY STATES ARE NOW RUNNING OUT.
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED PINTOBARBITAL.
THE SUPPLY OF THE SEDATIVE BEGAN TO DRY UP TWO YEARS AGO.
AFTER EUROPEAN HUMAN-RIGHTS GROUPS SPOKE UP AGAINST THE DRUG'S USE IN EXECUTIONS. A DANISH DRUG MAKER RESPONDED BY CUTTING OFF ITS DISTRIBUTION FOR USE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
Stephen: THOSE  DAMN DANISH! THEY WON'T SEND US THEIR DEATH DRUGS BUT WHO KNOWS HOW MANY LIVES THEY'VE CUT SHORT WITH THEIR DELECTABLE PASTRIES. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I HAVE HAVE COPEN-HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH THESE DAMN DANES. DON'T THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DON'T GET OUR HANDS ON THESE DEATH DRUGS SOON, SOMEONE MIGHT NOT DIE? LUCKILY, THERE'S A WAY TO KEEP THE EXECUTIONS ROLLING AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. THRIFT JUSTICE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT STATES ARE THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEATH PENALTY, IT'S AN ACTUAL LABORATORY AND THE RAT IS A HUMAN BEING. NOW IN TEXAS-- IN TEXAS PRISON OFFICIALS ARE SO DESPERATE TO GET THEIR HANDS ON PENTOBARBITOL THAT THEY HAVE FALSIFIED PRESCRIPTIONS AND LIED TO PHARMACIES. WHY GO THROUGH ALL THAT TROUBLE, TEXAS. YOU CAN GET POWERFUL DRUGS ON-LINE AS LONG AS THE OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH IS A 19 HOUR BONER. (LAUGHTER) AND TEXAS IS NOT, THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY STATE THAT'S THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR NEW WAYS TO PUT PEOPLE IN A BOX. SO IS OHIO.
DENNIS McGUIRE WAS EXECUTED BY LETHAL INJECTION WITH A COMBINATION OF DRUGS NEVER BEFORE USED IN THE UNITED STATES.
IT'S A SEDATIVE PAINKILLER COMBINATION BEING USED BECAUSE OHIO'S FORMER EXECUTION DRUG DRIED UP.
THIS IS A COMBINATION THAT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN USED IN LETHAL INJECTIONS. THEY ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR COLONOSCOPIES.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE A WIN-WIN, WHILE THEY'RE EXECUTING HIM, THEY CAN SCREEN HIM FOR POLYPS. OF COURSE--  (APPLAUSE) PEOPLE, ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE, ANYONE NOT STRAPPED TO A TABLE WERE ALL UP IN ARMS ABOUT KILLING A MAN WITH AN UNTESTED COCKTAIL. BUT FOLKS, FEDERAL JUDGE GREGORY FROST FOUND THAT OHIO IS FREE TO INNOVATE AND EVOLVE IN ITS PROCEDURES TOWARDS ADMINISTERING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. YES, OHIO IS FREE TO INNOVATE. AFTER ALL THEY ARE THE HOME OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS WHO, REMEMBER, INVENTED THE FLYING ELECTRIC CHAIR. (LAUGHTER) THERE IS JUST A LITTLE HITCH. THE DEADLY DRUG MIX HAD ONE FATAL FLAW. THE CONVICT'S 15 MINUTE DEATH STRUGGLE WAS DESCRIBED BY ONE WITNESS AS HORRIFIC. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE AMERICANS WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO KILL PEOPLE FOR US, BUT WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL OOKY. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND THAT DEATH SWEET SPOT. LUCKILY, SOME STATES-- SOME STATES OUT THERE WHO UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM, LIKE WYOMING, KNOW THAT ALL MORALLY COMPLEX ISSUES HAVE THE SAME ANSWER. MORE GUNS. JIM?
A WYOMING LAWMAKER PUSHING THE USE OF FIRING SQUADS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF EXECUTION FOR THOSE ON DEATH ROW.
YES. BRING BACK FIRING SQUADS. WITH SO MUCH GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA, SHOULDN'T WE SHOOT AT LEAST ONE PERSON WHO DESERVES IT? AND FIRING SQUADS--  (APPLAUSE) I BELIEVE THIS MIGHT JUST BE ME BUT FIRING SQUADS ARE A GREAT WAY TO THROW AN EXECUTION ON A BUDGET.
WYOMING ALLOWED THE USE OF THE GAS CHAMBER IF LETHAL INJECTION IS NOT AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO STATE SENATOR BRUCE BURNS BUILDING AN OPERATING GAS CHAMBER IS IMPRACTICAL AND A FIRING SQUAD IS THE CHEAPEST OPTION.
OKAY. SO IF WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAVE SOME SCRATCH, I GOT ALL KINDS OF IDEAS. PENTOBARBITOL MAY BE IN SHORT SUPPLY IN PRISON BUT NOT IN VETERINARIAN'S OFFICES WHERE IT'S THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR THE EUTHANASIA OF PETS. SO JUST PUT YOUR DEATH ROW INMATE IN A DOG COSTUME AND THEN TELL THE VET HE BIT THE NEIGHBOR. YOU CAN BURY HIM IN THE YARD NEXT TO THE CAT. HEY-- AND HEY, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS FREE? GRAVITY. OKAY. WE GOT PLENTY OF GRAVITY HERE AND LAST TIME I CHECKED AMERICA STILL HAS TALL BUILDINGS. I SAY JUST SHOVE THE CONDEMNED OFF THE SEARS TOWER, IF HE SURVIVES THE DROP, REMEMBER HE'LL LAND IN CHICAGO AND SOMEONE WILL SHOOT HIM. THE POINT IS--  (APPLAUSE) AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW WAYS TO PERPETRATE THE DEATH PENALTY, THERE ARE NO BAD IDEAS. NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE. OOH, WE COULD BEAT HIM TO DEATH WITH A TABLE. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW--  COME TO THINK OF IT, WHY ARE WE DOING ALL THE WORK HERE. WE SHOULD MAKE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BYOE. BRING YOUR OWN EXECUTION. WHATEVER YOU LIKE, CHAINSAW, CURLING IRON IN A BATHTUB, CHOKEABLE MONOPOLY PIECE. YOU KNOW, YOUR CHOICE. AND DON'T WORRY THAT IT'S CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. BECAUSE IF WE'RE CRUEL OFTEN ENOUGH, IT WON'T SEEM UNUSUAL. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
