[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A STAFF  WRITER FOR "THE NEW YORKER"  WHOSE NEW JOKE IS CALLED "GOING CLEAR."  IF THEIR LAWYERS ARE AS  LITIGIOUS AS THEY SAY, MY NEW  BOOK COULD BE CALLED "GOING BROKE."  PLEASE WELCOME LAWRENCE  WRIGHT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. YOU ARE A STAFF WRITER FOR THE  NEW YORKER. ONE OF YOUR PREVIOUS BOOKS IS  CALLED THE LOOMING TOWER WHICH  YOU WON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW  BOOK HERE CALLED "GOING CLEAR:   SCIENTOLOGY, HOLLYWOOD AND THE PRISON OF BELIEF."  WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ARE YOU A SUB PRESSIVE PERSON  YAMENT. DO YOU BELIEVE IN KFW? LY NOT HESITATE TO PUT MY  OUTETHICS IN YOU?
I GUESS I'VE COME TO THE  WRONG SHOW.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHAT  I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW? ARE YOU UPSET RIGHT NOW?
I'M UPSET.
Stephen: I WILL CONFRONT  SHATTER SUPPRESSION.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU SPOKE THIS  LANGUAGE.
Stephen: NOT ENTIRELY SURE  WHAT I SAID BUT IT SOUNDS  IMPRESSIVE. [LAUGHTER] WHY DID YOU WANT TO WRITE ABOUT  SCIENTOLOGY? WHY INVESTIGATE SOMEBODY'S ELZ'S  RELIGION. IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE IT,  BELIEVE IT, IF NOT, MOVE ON.
I'M FASCINATED BY RELIGION  ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE  YOU CAN BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU WANT WHICH ISN'T TRUE IN A LOT  OF PLACES.
Stephen: WHEN YOU SAY  SCIENTOLOGY, HOLLYWOOD AND A  PRISON OF BELIEF. IS ALL BELIEF A PRISON?
IN THIS CASE I WAS ESPECIALLY  THINKING HOW IN THE SEA ORG, THE  CLERGY.
Stephen: IT'S THE HIGHEST  LEVEL.
IT'S THE CLERGY IN THE  CATHOLIC CHURCH LIKE THE PRIEST  AND NUNS. THERE'S A LOT OF PHYSICAL ABUSES  GOING ON AND INVOLUNTARY CONFINE  THE. I STUMBLED OVER A FEDERAL F.B.I. INVESTIGATION AND THEY HAD  APPARENTLY PLANNED TO BREAK IN  TO THIS COMPOUND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND LIBERATE ALL  THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE BEING  HELD IN THIS REEDUCATION CAMP. AND THEIR SOURCES TOLD THEM  DON'T BOTHER. IF YOU DID THAT, AND THESE  PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEEN THERE  MONTHS AND YEARS, BUT THE EX-SCIENTOLOGISTS SAID IF YOU  DID THAT THEY WOULD SAY IT'S  SUNSHINE AND SEASHELLS, THEY'LL SAY THEY ARE HERE FOR OUR OWN  GOOD. THEY ARE NOT BEING HELD AGAINST  THEIR WILL. IT'S THEIR WILL THAT IS HOLDING  THEM THERE. THAT'S THE PRISON OF BELIEF. [  APPLAUSE  .
Stephen: ABUSE IS A STRONG  ACCUSATION. IS THERE ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF THIS  ABUSE?
I'VE HL 12 PEOPLE TELL ME  THEY'VE BEEN BEATEN BY DAVID  MISCAVIGE.
Stephen: IF I FOUND OUT THE  CATHOLIC CHURCH ABUSED 12  PEOPLE, I WOULD BE OUT OF THERE, I WOULD BE GONE IN MINUTES. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT A CRAZY RELIGION. [ LAUGHTER ]
NOW --
Stephen: NOW, YOU SAY THAT  SEA ORG IS THE PRIESTLY CLASS,  THE CLERICAL CLASS OF  SCIENTOLOGY.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY IS IT SEA ORG?
IN THE MIDDLE 60s L. RON  HUBBARD, THE FOUNDER WAS ON THE  RUN AND HE HAD A SCIENTOLOGY  NAVY. THEY SAILED AROUND THE  MEDITERRANEAN AND IN THE  CARIBBEAN.
Stephen: IS THAT WHY HE  DRESD LIKE THURSDAYTON HOWELL  III? [LAUGHTER] THERE'S ONE THING I ADMIRE ABOUT  HIM, LRH AS WE CALL HIM. HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN PAYING  TAXES AND NEITHER DO I. [LAUGHTER] HE GOT IN TROUBLE FOR NOT PAYING  TAXES. HOW DID HE GET OUT OF IT?
WELL, HE DIED. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: THAT'S THE  ULTIMATE ESCAPE.
THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, BUT -- HIS SUCCESSOR DAVID  MISCAVIGE BY 1993 SCIENTOLOGY  OWED $1 BILLION IN BACK TAXES AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT. THEY HAD TO GET A TAX EXEMPTION. THEY LAUNCHED A LAWSUIT AGAINST  THE IRS. THEY PUT PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS  ON AGENTS TO SEE WHO DRANK TOO  MUCH, WHO WAS FOOLG AROUND ON THE ROAD. WHATEVER THE MERIT OF THE CASE  WAS, THOSE LAWSUITS WERE  DROPPED.
Stephen: THEY GOT BE  OFFICIALLY IN A RELIGION AND  THEY DROPPED 24 LAWSUITS.
EXACTLY AND CALLED OFF THE  PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS.
Stephen: ONE OF THE OTHER  THINGS THAT APPEALS TO ME ABOUT  SCIENTOLOGY IS THAT THEY ARE INTO CELEBRITIES.
YES.
Stephen: I'M A CELEBRITY. THEY'VE DONE GREAT THINGS FOR  THEM. TOM CRUISE HAS NOT AGED. [ LAUGHTER ] WOULD IT HELP ME. IF I WENT TO HOLLYWOOD AND WENT  TO THE CELEBRITY CENTER AND  BECAME A SCIENTOLOGIST WOULD THAT BE GOOD FOR MY CAREER? CAN THEY DELIVER?
IT WOULD BE PUBLIC RELATIONS  MARTYRDOM FOR MOST. I THINK A LOT OF THEM ARE  SUFFERING A MARTYRDOM FOR THEIR  BELIEF. IT'S THE MOST STIGMATIZED  RELIGION FOR SURE. THEY CONTINUE TO LEND THEIR  CREDIBILITY TO THIS. THAT WAS WHAT DREW ME IN. I THOUGHT WHAT ARE THEY GETTING  OUT OF IT. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DO GET  THINGS OUT OF SCIENTOLOGY. I THINK PEOPLE WHO GO IN GET  THERAPY, THEY CALL IT AUDITING. PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING PERSONAL  PROBLEMS, THERE'S A MENU OF  COURSES THAT YOU CAN TAKE THAT MIGHT HELP YOU AND MANY PEOPLE  SAY THEY HAVE BEEN HELPED. SOME CELEBRITIES LIKE TOM CRUISE  GET THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE IN  THE CHURCH DON'T. THE SEA ORG MEMBERS BUILT HIM A  HANGAR FOR HIS AIRPLANES. THEY HANDCRAFTED A LIMOUSINE FOR  HIM THESE ARE PEOPLE PAID $50 A  WEEK AND THEY ARE POLISHING HIS LIGHT BULBS.
Stephen: MORE THAN I PAY MY  INTERNS. I SHOULD START A CULT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OR FOR LEGAL REASONS, LET'S SAY,  A RELIGION. THANK YOU SO MUCH  LAWRENCE WRIGHT, "GOING CLEAR."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
