STEPHEN: DWOAM BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I SPENT THE ENTIRE FIRST  ACT TALKING ABOUT MYSELF, BUT  NOT ALL THE NEWS IS THAT  HARD-HITTING. FOR INSTANCE, YESTERDAY, THIS IS  WHAT EVERYONE WAS COVERING:  A MONKEY LOOSE IN A FUR COAT LOOSE AT IKEA. NOTE TO THE MEDIA: A MONKEY AT  IKEA IS NOT NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] A MONKEY BUILDING THE "FJELL"  FOUR-DRAWER CHEST WITH NO  DOWELS LEFTOVER -- THAT'S NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] S. [  APPLAUSE  ] SO WHAT'S A PUNDIT WITH NO JUICY  STORIES TO GET ANGRY ABOUT  SUPPOSED TO DO? LUCKILY, THE FOLKS OVER AT FOX  NEWS ARE ALWAYS PREPARED TO  SMASH THE GLASS AND PULL OUT THE EMERGENCY MUSLIMS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE GROUND ZERO MOSQUE WAS  SUPPOSED TO BE A CULTURAL  CENTER, REMEMBER?
TURNS OUT IT'S AN EMPTY  SPACE WITH NO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS  DOZEN OF WORSHIPERS GATHER AT THE SITE FOR PRAYER SERVICES.
IT IS ALL PRAY AND NO PLAY.
IT'S ALL PRAY AND NO PLAY.
IT TURNS OUT WE MAY HAVE BEEN  LIED TO.
YOU COULD CALL THIS A  MOS-QUE-RADE.
Stephen: OH, IT'S A  MOSQUE-ER-ADE ALL RIGHT. I'M IN NO MAH-MOOD FOR IT, I'VE  JIHAD IT UP TO HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MEDIA HAJJ TO MECCA BIG DEAL  OUT OF THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] HUMMUS. [ LAUGHTER ] OH. IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE ANGRY  ABOUT THIS AGAIN. WAIT, WHY WAS I ANGRY  ORIGINALLY? LOUD MUSIC? SCHWARMA FUMES? WHAT?
BUILDING THE ISLAMIC MOSQUE  AT GROUND  ZERO IS LIKE POURING  SALT ON THE WOUND OF THE 9/11  VICTIMS.
IT IS AN INSULT. IT IS DEEPLY OFFENSIVE.
IT'S POKING A STICK IN  THE  EYE.
A FINGER IN THE EYE OF  AMERICA.
Stephen: YEAH, IT'S A FINGER  IN THE EYE! AND AMERICA NEVER HAD TIME TO  DEPLOY OUR THREE STOOGES  DEFENSE! [ LAUGHTER ] TWO YEARS AGO, WE WERE TOLD THIS  BUILDING WOULD BE A COMMUNITY  CENTER, BUT THE ONLY COMMUNITY PROGRAM THEY HAVE IS  A CLASS IN CAPOEIRA -- AN  AFRO-BRAZILIAN MARTIAL ART THAT  COMBINES DANCE AND MUSIC! FIGHTING, WITH DANCE AND MUSIC? HAVE WE LEARNED NOTHING FROM  "WEST SIDE STORY?" [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS GREAT. THERE ARE SO MANY TWO-YEAR-OLD  STORIES TO BE MAD ABOUT. REMEMBER THAT ICELANDIC VOLCANO  EYJAFJALLAJOOï¿½KULL? WHY CAN'T I PRONOUNCE YOU?! [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHAT ABOUT THAT TWO-YEAR-OLD  INDONESIAN KID WHO SMOKED? WHERE WERE HIS PARENTS?! I MEAN, NOW HE'S FOUR, SO IT'S  COOL. BUT BACK THEN?! MAKES ME SICK. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON  LEBRON JAMES' HOUR-LONG SIGNING  SPECIAL. PRETTY COCKY MOVE FOR A GUY  WHO'S NEVER EVEN WON A  CHAMPIONSHIP--  IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID. BEFORE HE DID. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, 2010 MAKES ME SO ANGRY, I  JUST WANT TO -- [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
