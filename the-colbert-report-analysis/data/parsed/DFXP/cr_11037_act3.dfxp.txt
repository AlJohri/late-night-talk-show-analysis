(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT MADE A MOVIE THAT HAS UPSET A MADMAN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AND MY NETWORK WON'T LET ME SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT McDONALD'S. PLEASE WELCOME SETH ROGEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Stephen: HEY! MR. ROGEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU!
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, SIR.
Stephen: WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU FOR WEARING A SUIT BY THE WAY
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE, SO--
Stephen:  YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY TO GO TO COURT.
I FEEL LIKE I AM.
Stephen: ARE YOU ON TRIAL? AT LEAST THEY LEGALIZED CARRYING WEED.
Stephen: THE WEED IS NOT REALLY THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW.
NO, IT'S NOT
Stephen: IT'S GOING TOE TO TOE WITH THE NORTH KOREANs IN THERMONUCLEAR CONFLICT. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY.
Stephen: LAUGH IT UP. YOU'RE ACTOR, WRITER, COMEDIAN,  FILMMAKER, MADE SOME OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. KNOCKED UP, SUPER BAD, PINE APPLE EXPRESS, THIS IS THE END. THE NEW FILM IS CALLED THE INTERVIEW, OPENS ON CHRISTMAS DAY.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY. IT UPSET THE NORTH KOREANS.
IT DID.
Stephen: OKAY. DID YOU THINK IT WOULD UPSET THE NORTH KOREANS?
UH...
Stephen: DID YOU PICTURE THEM AS A JOLLY REGIME?
HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S GETTING A KICK OUT OF THAT LUBE EVERY TIME I SEE THAT PICTURE.
Stephen: OH, HE LOVES IT THAT'S HIS FRIEND LUBY.
EXACTLY. WE DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THE MOVIE, TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING WE WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE THAT HAD ONE FOOT IN REALITY THAT'S SOMETHING WE AS FILMMAKERS LIKE AND THINK IS INTERESTING AS AUDIENCE MEMBERS AS WELL.
Stephen: BUT IS IT APPROPRIATE TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT  REAL THINGS IN THE WORLD?
I PERSONALLY THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT REAL THINGS. WE THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD INJECT SOME SLIGHT RELEVANCE I GUESS, OR -- I'M WORRIED
Stephen: FOR A SECOND, I'M -- DON'T WORRY I DON'T HAVE POISON ON MY HANDS. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT AN AGENT OF THE DPRK DID YOU THINK ABOUT CHANGING HIS NAME AT ALL, LIKE CALLING  HIM PHIL JONG-UN?
WE DID. AND WE THOUGHT, WHOSE FEELINGS ARE WE TRYING TO SPARE BY DOING THAT, KIM JONG-UN?
Stephen: RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
AND SO...
Stephen: I'M BEHIND YOU 100%. I THINK THESE GUYS CAN SUCK IT.
YEAH, WE WERE FASCINATED BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN NORTH KOREA. THE MORE WE READ ABOUT IT, THE MORE BIZARRE
Stephen: HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID YOU DO ON THIS?
WE READ ABOUT IT A LOT. WATCHED DOCUMENTARIES, RESEARCHED ONLINE,  READ NEWS ARTICLES. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS  YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS BASED ON FACT BECAUSE VERY LITTLE REAL INFORMATION GETS IN AND OUT OF NORTH KOREA. BUT WE DID AS MUCH AS WE HUMANLY COULD.
Stephen: DID YOU TALK TO DENNIS RODMAN?
WE DIDN'T. WE TALKED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WENT TO NORTH KOREA WITH DENNIS RODMAN.
Stephen: UH-HUH. WE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO MET KIM JONG-UN THEMSELVES.
Stephen: BECAUSE IN THE MOVIE, ONE OF THE THINGS I  LIKE ABOUT IT IS HE'S A FUN GUY TO HANG OUT WITH.
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THEY SAID IS WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROOM WITH HIM, YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF WHERE HE IS. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROOM OFF WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU'RE ALWAYS AWARE WHERE HE IS. AND THEY SAID YOU'RE HAVING A DRINK, HEAR A LAUGH, AND THEN KIM JONG-UN WOULD JUST BE THERE -- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT? (LAUGHTER) WHICH IS SOMETHING WE PUT IN THE MOVIE IS HE WAS KIND OF UNASSUMING. WE TRIED TO MAKE HIM, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD, ADORABLE.
Stephen: HE IS. HE'S ADORABLE UP TO A POINT.
UP TO A POINT, YES. AND THEN WE TRY TO EXPOSE IN A COMEDIC WAY AS POSSIBLE, WE TRY TO GET INTO WHAT IS ACTUALLY HORRIBLE ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND EXPLAIN WHAT IS BAD ABOUT IT. AND IT IS REALLY BAD.
Stephen: A TOTALITARIAN REGIME HIGHLIGHTED WITH  DICK JOKES.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK, WE HAVE A CLIP FROM THE MOVIE WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING.
DOG! BIG DOG!
BIG DOG? IT'S LIKE CLIFFORD SIZE. WE'RE TALKING FALCOR IN   THE NEVERENDING STORY. IT'S LIKE A DRAGON DOG. THIS IS LIKE A DRAGON DOG.
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR? I DON'T KNOW. T'S LIKE A BIG DOG. IT'S ORANGE -- GOT STRIPES. IT'S LIKE A BIG ORANGE STRIPEY DOG. (GROWLING)
THERE'S A TIGER. A TIGER! YOU LED MY FRIEND INTO A TIGER PATCH?
I TOLD YOU THERE WERE TIGERS THERE.
HE'S NOT VERY HAPPY NOW. IT'S DARK OUT THERE HE PROBABLY DOESN'T SEE YOU. (GROWLING)
IT HAS NIGHT VISION. THE TIGER HAS NIGHT VISION GOGGLES? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU COULD SEE.
Stephen: RIGHT. YOU GUYS GET INTO SOME ISSUES, CLEARLY.
CLEARLY, TIGER-RELATED ISSUES ARE BIG IN NORTH KOREA.
Stephen: YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GO TO NORTH KOREA NOW, RIGHT?
I DO KNOW THAT, YES. I DID NOT PLAN ON IT PRIOR TO THIS SO IT DOES NOT AFFECT MY TRAVEL PLANS IMMEDIATELY, BUT I'LL NEVER GO. JUST FOR SAFETY, I PROBABLY WON'T GO TO SOUTH KOREA.
NICE PLACE. I HAVE BEEN THERE ONCE, I LOVED IT. KIND OF A BUMMER. K-POP I LOVE,  I'M GOING TO STAY AWAY FROM BARBECUE, JUST TO BE SAFE ALTOGETHER.
Stephen: WHAT ELSE ARE YOU WORKING ON? BECAUSE YOU WROTE THIS, TOO, AND CO-DIRECTED IT. WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NEXT?
WE HAVE AN ANIMATED MOVIE THAT IS -- IT WILL BE THE FIRST, LIKE, R-RATED FULLY C.G.I., LIKE, PIXAR-STYLE ANIMATED MOVIE AND IT'S CALLED SAUSAGE PARTY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO UPSET THE GERMANS THIS TIME.
I KNOW. WE REALLY ARE.
Stephen: WELL, SETH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: SETH ROGEN, "THE INTERVIEW" OPENS CHRISTMAS DAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
