TONIGHT IS AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS STRUGGLING? NO, I'M DOING JUST FINE. A NEW THREAT TO CHRISTMAS. FROSTEE THE SNOW MAN IS MUSHY THE MUSH MAN. AND ALEX BLUMBERG WANTS TO KNOW HOW A TEE SHIRT IS MADE? WELL WHEN A COTTON LOVES A TEXTILE MILL VERY MUCH THEY EXCHANGE A SPECIAL HUG. A 2014 CALENDAR OF SEXY TAXI DRIVERS. IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES THEY WERE SEXY PROFESSOR. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT." ♪ ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: RIGHT THERE! THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Audience: STEPHEN! Stephen: A ROOM FULL OF THEM TONIGHT. GOD BLESS YOU ALL. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M DEDICATING TONIGHT'S SHOW TO THE WHALES. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: BEFORE WE GET STARTED I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK TO THE YOUNGER VIEWERS IN THE COLBERT NATION. I KNOW YOU'RE FILLING OUT COLLEGE APPLICATIONS OR RECEIVING EARLY DECISION LETTERS. I KNOW YOU'RE EAGER TO MOVE OUT OF YOUR PARENT' HOUSE GO TO COLLEGE AND THEN MOVE BACK TO YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE. I KNOW IT'S STRESSFUL. WHEN I APPLIED TO DARTMOUTH EARLY DECISION I WAS IN SECOND GRADE. I WROTE MY PAPER ON THE PERILS OF THE NANNY STATE. I WENT AFTER MY NANNY HARD. IT'S NOT NAPPY TIME, ROSITA, I WILL SLEEP WHEN I AM DEAD. MY HIGH SCHOOL VIEWERS OUT THERE, OVER ACHIEVERS APPLYING TO HARVARD AND PRINCETON. I AM CONCERNED YOU'RE AIMING TOO LOW. IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A MORE ELITE INSTITUTION ON THE SCENE.
WALMART, 600 JOB OPENINGS AND 2300 JOB APPLICANTS.
AT A RATE THAT'S LESS THAN 3% ARE GETTING HIRED. HARVARD HAS A HIGHER ACCEPTANCE RATE.
Stephen: YES, WALMART IS NOW HARD TORE GET INTO THAN HARVARD. BROWN STUDENTS WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO EITHER OF THEM ANYWAY. I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND WHY WALMART IS SUCH A SELECTIVE INSTITUTION. MANY OF OUR PRESIDENTS HAVE GONE THEIR TO BUY BULK TOILET PAPER. YOUTH NATION, IT MAYBE TOO LATE TO GET INTO THE WALMART OF YOUR CHOICE. WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS OF YOUR OWN GROOM THAT CHILD FOR WALMART FROM DAY ONE. THAT OF COURSE MEANS SENDING THEM TO THE RIGHT PRESCHOOL. LOOK FOR ONE WITH A EMPHASIS ON BLOCK STACKING. OKAY. IT'S A SKILL THEY NEED FOR MAKING TOWERS OF DISCOUNT MILK. GOOD LUCK, NATION. REMEMBER, ODDS ARE YOU WON'T GET IN. BE SURE TO APPLY TO A SAFETY LIKE RENT -A- CENTER OR YALE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: NOW, NATHAN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: I HAVE ALWAYS SAID. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID AMERICA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: SOME NAYSAYERS THEY SAY THE COUNTRY IS IN DECLINE BECAUSE IT'S HARDER TO GET INTO WALMART THAN HARVARD. REALLY? WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT SOUNDS LIKE [BEEP]. THEY CLAIM THE MIDDLE CLASS HAVE A DECLINING OF STANDARD OF LIVING. IT ADJUSTS TO INFLATION OF 199. SO INCOME HASN'T CHANGED FROM THE 80s. NEITHER HAS A LOT OF THINGS. LOOK AT ROB LOW. YOU'RE OLDER THAN I AM! WHY AREN'T YOU MELTING. YOU'RE LIKE A FLOWER PRESERVED IN AMBER. NOW, NO SURPRISE -- [LAUGHING]
Stephen: NO SURPRISE. BITCHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS HAS BECOME OBAMA'S LATEST PET PROJECT. WHICH HE DETAILED RECENTLY IN A MAJOR SPEECH HE CALLED "LET'S TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT OBAMA CARE." JIM.
-- DECREASING MOBILITY POSE A FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM, OUR WAY OF LIFE, AND WHAT WE STAND FOR AROUND THE GLOBE. IT HAS JEOPARDIZED MIDDLE CLASS AMERICA, IF YOU WORK HARD YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD. I BELIEVE THIS IS THE DEFINING CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME.
Stephen: NOT TRUE SIR. I BELIEVE THE DEFINING CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME IS SELF HEATING NACHOS. WE'RE STILL WAITING, NASA. WHEN THE PRECEDENT WAS DONE PANDERING TO THE POWERFUL PAUPERS.
OUR OUR INCOME RATES NEAR JAMAICA AND ARGENTINA BUT THAT IT IS HARDER TODAY FOR A CHILD BORN HERE IN AMERICA TO IMPROVE HER STATION IN LIFE THEN IT IS FOR CHILDREN IN MOST OF OUR WEALTHY ALLIES.
Stephen: GENTLEMAN MAKE A POOR, REALLY. I SPENT A WEEK IN THE SANDALS ALL INCLUSIVE MONTEGO BAY. NOBODY WAS POOR. I CHECKED EVERY KA BAN. >>Anthony: TAKE A CHILL PILL, SIR. I KNOW THE MIDDLE CLASS IS BETTER OFF THAN EVER. THAT TRUTH BRINGS US TONIGHT'S WORDS CHANNEL SERING. NATION, FORGET WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS. FORGET WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY. FORGET WHAT YOUR BANK STATEMENT SAYS. AMERICANS ARE DOING BETTER THAN EVER. THAT'S THE NEW VIRGINIA POSTREL READ. CONGRATULATIONS IT'S A GREAT READ AND GUARANTEES YOU WILL NEVER GET A RAISE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. MS. POSTREL STARTS OFF WHAT SHE SAYS MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS CALL A LIFE EXPERIENCE. WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME ON THE PLANE, PLAY POKER, WATCH "DUCK DYNASTY" AND RUN HE WILLERY FROM THE DVR QUE. ROCKEFELLER COULDN'T STREAM "DUCK DYNASTY" ON THE iPAD. BET HE COULD GET IS SEIGFELD FOLLIES ON HIS ZOOM. THIS CHALLENGES THE INCREASING CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT'S STAGNATED FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. IRE WELCOME MIDDLE CLASS. I HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN WATCHING ME IS A FORM OF CURRENCY. ALSO FOR THE RECORD, A FORM OF SUBSTANCE APBS. WHO NEEDS FOOD STAMPS. BELLY UP TO THE ALL YOU CAN STEPHEN BUFFET. BUT FOR SOME REASON, FOR SOME REASON, FOLKS, ECONOMIC ANALYSTS DON'T FACTOR IN THE VALUE OF QUALITY TV PROGRAMMING. AS POSTREL POINTS OUT LITTLE OF THIS CUSTOMIZED ENTERTAINMENT. WAS POPULAR A DECADE AGO. WHY DOESN'T WATCHING MORE TV COUNT AS INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY. FOLKS, ALL OF THIS ENTERTAINMENT ISN'T A PLAYGROUND FOR THE RICH. AS SHE SAYS NEW ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO POORER PEOPLE WITH AMPLE LEISURE TIME. WHEN I SEE A MAN ON THE SIDEWALK I THINK LOOK AT THAT LUCKY FELLA WITH AMPLE LEISURE TIME. AMERICA, REMEMBER AMERICA IS EXTRA RICH RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE MIST OF A NEW GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION. SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE LATE ON YOUR MORTGAGE SEND A NOTE REMAINING YOUR BANK THAT "BREAKING BAD" WON TEN EMMYS. NOW, THE POINT IS BEING DISTRACTED FROM YOUR POVERTY IS THE NEW FORM OF WEALTH. FOLKS, BY THAT STANDARD, BY THAT STANDARD AMERICA'S MIDDLE CLASS ARE THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN HISTORY. JUST LOOK AT PORN. IT IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE. IT MAY NOT SHOW UP IN THE PRODUCTIVITY DATA BUT YOU'RE PRODUCING SOMETHING. SO, QUIT, QUIT COMPLAINING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: OKAY. YOU ARE RICH WITH TV. REMEMBER MARINE ANTOINETTE MAY OF LIVED IN A PALACE. SHE NEVER GOT TO WATCH THE LEARNING CHANNEL. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
