[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE  ENEMIES OF THIS COUNTRY WHO  WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE US DESTROYED, AND IT IS MY JOB TO  WORRY ABOUT THEM AT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER EDITION  OF AXIS OF EVIL OF THE WEEK. NOW, I'M ON RECORD AS ANTI-NORTH  KOREA. THAT RECORD? "PYONG-YANK ME. SONGS IN THE KEY  OF RAGE." [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, FOLKS, THE KOREAN WAR WAS  ONE OF AMERICA'S LONGEST  CONFLICTS-- IF I REMEMBER MY HISTORY, OUR TROOPS WERE STUCK  THERE FOR 11 ZANY, YET  THOUGHT-PROVOKING YEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL THIS TIME, NORTH KOREA HAS  FINALLY GONE TOO FAR.
BOLD NEW THREATS FROM NORTH  KOREA AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE  UNITED STATES. THE COMMUNIST NATION SAYS IT  PLANS TO CARRY OUT A NUCLEAR  TEST AND MORE LONG-RANGE ROCKET  LAUNCHES.
STATE MEDIA MADE THE  ANNOUNCEMENT THAT NORTH KOREA  WAS LOCKED IN AN ALL-OUT WAR OF CONFRONTATION WITH ITS ARCH  ENEMY, THE UNITED STATES.
IT'S ARCHENEMY, THE UNITED  STATES.
Stephen: WHOA, ARCHENEMIES? FOLKS, THIS IS A SERIOUS  INCREASE IN HOSTILITIES AND I  CANNOT SIT IDLY BY WHILE THEY MAKE THESE THREATS. SO I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING RIGHT  NOW TO NORTH KOREA. HEEEEEY. [ LAUGHTER ] HEEEEEY. [ LAUGHTER ] DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF  KOREA. WE NEED TO TALK. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, UHH,  WE'RE FLATTERED THAT YOU THINK  OF US AS ARCHENEMIES, BUT THAT'S  KIND OF TAKING OUR RELATIONSHIP TO A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. KIND OF A BIG COMMITMENT AND I'M  NOT SURE WE'RE READY FOR THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN WE JUST GOT OUT OF A  50-YEAR ARCHENEMY THING WITH THE  SOVIETS AND THAT WAS REALLY  SPECIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU HATE  SOMEBODY LIKE THAT ONCE IN A  LIFETIME. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SINCE THEN WE THOUGHT WE'D  PLAY THE FIELD. TRIED TO HAVE SOME QUICKIES WITH  IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, BUT IT'S  JUST DRAGGING ON. THE TALIBAN WILL NOT STOP  CALLING US. DON'T GET ME WRONG, YOU'RE  TERRIBLE AND WE HATE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ARCHENEMIES? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE A  CHANCE AND RUIN WHAT WE ALREADY  HAVE? RIGHT NOW WE'RE FOES WITH  BENEFITS AND THAT'S GREAT. YOU LAUNCH SOME ROCKETS, WE  IMPOSE SOME SANCTIONS, AND  THERE'S NO PRESSURE TO STAY OVER AT EACH OTHER'S COUNTRIES. WHRAF LAUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] HONESTLY, NORTH KOREA, CAN I  JUST SAY SOMETHING TO YOU  NEMESIS TO NEMESIS? HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT LOOKING  -- THOUGHT ABOUT THAT NEIGHBOR  OF YOURS, SOUTH KOREA? YOU TWO HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. THERE'S A HISTORY THERE. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY  REALLY, REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE THE ONE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO  HATE HAS BEEN RIGHT UNDER YOUR  DEMILITARIZED ZONE THIS WHOLE  TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY  IS:  WE LOATHE YOU; WE'RE JUST NOT IN  LOATHE WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO LET'S JUST KEEP OUR WRATH  PLATONIC. WE CAN STILL RATTLE EACH OTHER'S  SWORDS, BUT UNTIL THESE FEELINGS  BLOW OVER, DON'T THREATEN US, WE'LL THREATEN YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
