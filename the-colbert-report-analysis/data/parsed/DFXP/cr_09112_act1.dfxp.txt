Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  FOLKS, THANK YOU  SO MUCH.   ( CHEERS )   LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU  SO MUCH. LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT, FOLKS. ENORMOUS NEWS COMING OUT OF  WASHINGTON, D.C.--    ( CHEERS )   PLEASE, NATION. WE GOTTA DO IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, FOLKS. WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE SHOCKING  NEWS OUT OF THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION THAT AFFECTS ANY AMERICAN WHO MAKES PHONE CALLS. ( LAUGHTER )  SO ANYONE OVER 25. FOR MORE, WE WATCH A SCREEN.
THE N.S.A. HAS BEEN SECRETLY  SPYING ON EVERYDAY AMERICANS FOR  MONTHS. A NEW REPORT SAYS THE N.S.A. IS  COLLECTING PHONE RECORDS FROM  MILLIONS OF VERIZON WIRELESS  CUSTOMERS.
THE ORDER WAS ISSUED BY THE  SECRET SURVEILLANCE COURT AND  GRANTED THE GOVERNMENT UNLIMITED AUTHORITY TO COLLECT DATA.
Stephen:  YES, THE NATIONAL  SECURITY AGENCY IS SPYING ON OUR  PHONE CALLS, AND UNLIKE DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THIS  TIME IT'S THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  YEAH. THIS GUY, HE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO  OUTDO HIS PREDECESSOR. OH, HE POURED WATER ON THEIR  FACE? I'M GOING TO BLOW 'EM UP. DID I WIN? THAT'S HOW HE TALKS, BY THE WAY. THAT'S MY OBAMA IMPRESSION. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, ACCORDING TO THE U.K.'S  "GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER, VERIZON'S  BUSINESS SERVICES DIVISION WAS ORDERED BY THE F.B.I. TO DELIVER  MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS'  TELE-PHONY METADATA. METADATA MEANS INFORMATION ABOUT  A CALL'S LENGTHS, LOCATION, AND  PARTICIPANTS. TELE-PHONY IS WHAT A  TWO-YEAR-OLD CALLS A TELEPHONE. ( APPLAUSE )  AND BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE ME,  OBAMA KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE CALLS  BETWEEN BETSY AND PUPPY WUPPY. NOW, FOLKS I'M GOING TO BE  STRAIGHT WITH YOU. I'M CONFLICTED HERE, FOLKS. ON THE ONE HAND THIS PROVES  OBAMA IS A TYRANNICAL DESPOT WHO  IGNORES ALL THE RULES. ON THE OTHER HAND, I KIND OF  LIKE TYRANNICAL DESPOTS WHO  BREAK ALL THE RULES. SHOWS SPUNK. AND JUST A CHERRY ON TOP OF MY  CONFLICT SUNDAE, I'M NO FAN OF  THE "NEW YORK TIMES," BUT THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS NO FAN OF  OBAMA DOING THIS, SAYING IN  TODAY'S OP-ED, "THE  ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW LOST ALL CREDIBILITY."  YES, I'D LIKE TO ORDER HOME  DELIVERY OF THE "NEW YORK  TIMES," PLEASE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  MY WIFE LIKES THE "STYLE"  SECTION. I GO STRAIGHT FOR THE OBAMA  BASHING. BUT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY MAKE A  PHONE CALL JUST THEN. I JUST ASSUMED WANT N.S.A. IS  LISTENING AND WILL PASS IT ON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THEN AGAIN, I DO THINK THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION HAS A POINT. WHEN THEY CALL THIS PROGRAM "A  CRITICAL TOOL IN PROTECTING THE  NATION FROM TERRORIST THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES," AND NOT JUST  BECAUSE ANYONE WHO HAS DEALT  WITH VERIZON'S CUSTOMER SERVICE WANTS TO KILL SOMEONE. NOW, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR  LINDSAY GRAHAM MAKES A GREAT  POINT.
I'M A VERIZON CUSTOMER. I DON'T MIND VERIZON TURNING  OVER RECORDS TO THE THE  GOVERNMENT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THEY TRY TO  MATCH UP A KNOWN TERRORIST  PHONING WITH SOMEBODY IN THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TALKING  WITH TERRORISTS. I KNOW I'M NOT, SO WE DON'T HAVE  ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
Stephen:  YES, IF YOU DON'T  HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, PEOPLE  SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT ANYTHING YOU'VE GOT. THAT'S WHY I AM CALLING ON  SENATOR LINDSAY GRAHAM TO STOP  WEARING PANTS. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  SO WE CAN FINALLY, FINALLY LAY  TO REST THE DISTURBING AND I AM SURE UNFOUND RUMORS THAT HE IS A  MIDDLE AGED LESBIAN. BUT I DON'T FOR A MINUTE BELIEVE  THAT'S TRUE. BUT THERE IS ONE PARTY WHOSE  PRIVACY HAS BEEN VIOLATED HERE. IT'S VERIZON'S. WE, THE PUBLIC, HAVE NO RIGHT TO  KNOW THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION  THAT THEY TURNED OVER OUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. ( LAUGHTER )  THIS WILL LOSE VERIZON MILLIONS  OF CUSTOMERS, OR IT WOULD IF  THEIR CONTRACT EVER EXPIRED. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  THE POINT IS-- THE POINT IS,  FOLKS, THESE DOMESTIC SPYING PROGRAMS ARE SOMETIMES  NECESSARY. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I HAVE  RECEIVED SPY TRAINING FROM  RETIRED UNDERCOVER C.I.A. AGENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE  INTERNATIONAL SPY MUSEUM PETER  EARNEST. LET'S RELIVE THAT MOMENT IN  TONIGHT'S "COLBERT CLASSIC."   ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO  TALK TO ME TODAY.
I'M DELIGHTED TO MEET WITH  YOU.
Stephen:  YOU'RE GOING TO  TEACH ME HOW TO BE A SPY. WHY ARE YOU THE MAN? GIVE ME YOUR BONA FIDES WILL.
I WAS FOR 25 YEARS IN THE  CLANDESTINE SERVICE. THAT'S OPERATIONS, RECRUITING  AND RUNNING AGENTS, COVERT  ACTION.
Stephen:  HOW MANY PEOPLE  HAVE YOU KILLED?
NONE.
Stephen:  WOULD YOU TELL ME  IF HU?
I WOULD-- I WOULD --
Stephen:  WOULD YOU.
I WOULD PROBABLY HOANL THAT.
Stephen:  OKAY, I'LL PUT  YOU DOWN FOR SEVEN.
THAT'S A HIGH NUMBER.
Stephen:  IS IT?
YES.
Stephen:  NOT AS HIGH AS  EIGHT.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen:  WHO IS THE MOST  EXOTIC LADY SPY YOU EVER SEDUCED  ON A MISSION?
FIRST OF ALL, I NEVER SEDUCED  A WOMAN SPY ON A MISSION.
Stephen:  THEY SEDUCED YOU?
NO, NO, IN OTHER WORDS, IT  JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN.
Stephen:  THERE WAS NO  SEDUCTION IT WAS JUST COLD-BLOOD  HUMPING.
I PROBABLY WOULD NOT  CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  KEEP IT KIND OF  SPICY.
NO, BUT I THINK IN THE COURSE  OF OPERATIONS, YOU DO RUN INTO  INTERESTING PEOPLE, AND YOU RUN INTO THEM IN VERY INTIMATE  CIRCUMSTANCES.
Stephen:  WHILE SERVING THE  C.I.A., YOU GOT THE AGENCY'S  INTELLIGENCE MEDAL OF MERIT.
YES.
Stephen:  FOR SUPERIOR  PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT YOUR  CAREER.
YES.
Stephen:  DOESN'T HAVING A  C.I.A. MEDAL OF MERIT ON YOUR  CHEST KIND OF BLOW YOUR COVER WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FIELD?
I AM NO LONGER UNDERCOVER. MY MEDAL IS RIGHT HERE.
Stephen:  THAT'S A  GOOD-LOOKING MEDAL.
YEAH, THAT'S THE MEDAL OF  MERIT. AND SINCE I'M NO LONGER  UNDERCOVER, I HAVE MY MEDAL.
Stephen:  CAN I TAKE A LOOK  AT THAT?
YOU CERTAINLY CAN. YOU'LL NOTICE, BY THE WAY, THAT  HAS MY NAME ON IT.
Stephen:  IT SURE DOES. THAT COULD BE BUFFED OFF. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR THIS? NO, I WOULDN'T PUT A PRICE ON  IT.
Stephen:  COME ON!
I WOULDN'T SELL MY MEDAL.
WHAT'S IT WORTH? 50 BUCKS?
I WOULDN'T SELL IS.
Stephen:  100 I WANT IT. WHERE DO YOU KEEP THIS?
I JUST HAVE IT RIGHT HERE ON  THE CREDENZA RIGHT OVER THERE.
OKAY.
Stephen:  WHAT'S THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SPY AND A  MAGICIAN? ( LAUGHTER )
THE DIFFERENCE-- WELL, BOTH  THE MAGICIAN AND THE SPY  ENGAGE-- CAN ENGAGE IN DECEIT,  DECEPTION.
Stephen:  RIGHT, ILLUSIONS.
ILLUSIONS.
Stephen:  I'LL DO A LITTLE  TRICK FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. THINK OF THE FOUR OF CLUBS.
OKAY I'VE GOT IT IN MY MIND. OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  IS IN THE CARD? ( APPLAUSE )
... THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU  PULLED OUT THE CARD THAT YOU  ASKED ME TO THINK OF.
Stephen:  YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  WHEN WORKING  UNDER COVER, I ASSUME IT'S BEST  TO HAVE A WHOLE NEW IDENTITY.
YES. I THINK, YES.
Stephen:  LET ME TRY ONE ON  YOU RIGHT NOW.
SURE.
Stephen:  HELLO. ( LAUGHTER )  I'M PETER EARNEST. AND WHO ARE YOU?
I'M PETER EARNEST.
Stephen:  THAT CAN'T BE  BECAUSE I'M PETER EARNEST.
WELL--
WELL.
I NEVER MET ANYBODY --
Stephen:  I NEVER MET  ANYBODY.
IT'S REMARKABLE.
Stephen:  IT'S REMARKABLE.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. DO YOU KNOW WHERE PETER EARNEST  WAS BORN?
Stephen:  AMERICA? SCOTLAND?
EDINBOROUGH.
Stephen:  SCOTLAND.
OKAY.
Stephen:  THIS IS MY OFFICE  AND THAT'S MY DESK AND THAT'S MY  MEDAL.
NOT-- WELL, NOW --
Stephen:  THAT IS MY MEDAL  OVER THERE.
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT NOW. WE'VE RULED THAT OUT.
Stephen:  EXCUSE ME?
WE'VE RIEWSTLED THAT OUT.
Stephen:  WHICH ONE IS IT,  AMERICA? WHO IS THE REAL PETER EARNEST? I'M SAY SOMETHING ONLY PETER  EARNEST WOULD SAY. I'M PETER EARNEST UPON.
BUT I'M PETER EARNEST.
Stephen:  PREPARE YOURSELF  FAIR SHOCK. YOU'RE YOU. ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, I MEAN, I FEEL  REASSURED.
Stephen:  SO, OKAY, YOU  APPEAR TO BE SUFFICIENTLY  BAD-ASS TO TEACH ME HOW TO BE A  SPY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  OKAY. WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO BECOME A  SPY?
NUMBER ONE, ASSUME NOTHING.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, I  DON'T.
OKAY, DON'T ASSUME.
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW, NOR  I DO CARE.
BE PREPARED TO TAKE RISKS,  SUCH AS BREAKING INTO A PLACE  YOU SHOULDN'T BE.
Stephen:  OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?
Stephen:  OKAY.
FINALLY, YOU NEED TO CARRY  OUT A COVERT ACTION, A COVERT  MISSION.
Stephen:  OKAY, LET'S GIVE  IT A SHOT. LET'S GO.
LET'S GO. OKAY. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, STEPHEN, IS  A TIE. JUST IMAGINE YOURSELF WEARING  THAT TIE.
Stephen:  UH-HUH.
UNDERNEATH YOUR SHIRT IS  STRAPPED A CAMERA.
Stephen:  AND YOU SCRAP  THAT CAMERA ON YOUR CHEST TO  HIDE YOUR UGLY TIE?
NO, NO, THINK OF IT AS  REVERSED. IN OTHER WORDS, THE STRAPS AND  THE CAMERA ARE UNDERNEATH YOUR  SHIRT.
Stephen:  HOLDING YOUR TIE  DOWN.
NO, NO, THE TIE SOEVER THE  SHIRT. SP WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A CAMERA  CONCEALED BEHIND THE TIE.
Stephen:  OKAY, THAT IS  TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUR TIE.
NO, NO, NO, WHAT YOU DO, YOU  HAVE A LITTLE HOLE, A LITTLE  HOLE IN THE TIE AND A CAMERA PEEK THROUGHS THAT HOLE AND CAN  TAKE A PICTURE.
Stephen:  OF SOMEONE ELSE'S  TIE?
NO.
Stephen:  IT THIS LOOKS  LIKE A FIRE CRACKER.
THEY SAY RECTAL TOOL KIT.
Stephen:  COME AGAIN?
OKAY. YOU SEE THOSE LITTLE TOOLS  THERE-- KNIVES, SCREWDRIVERS? ALL OF THOSE FIT INTO THE LITTLE  KIT THERE THAT CLOSES AND IT CAN  BE CONCEALED IN THE RECTUM.
Stephen:  THE WHOLE KIT AND  CABOODLE GOES WHERE THE SUN  DON'T SHINE.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
Stephen:  AND YOU TRY TO  CAPTURE ME AND GO, "SURE, SEARCH  ME ANYWHERE, JUST NOT MY BUTT."
THAT IS RIGHT. LOOK AT THIS. IT'S MADE TO LOOK LIKE A  DICTIONARY. IT'S A CONCEALMENT DEVICE.
Stephen:  AND THAT ENTIRE  THING GOES UP YOUR BUTT?
NO.
Stephen:  WHAT DO WE HAVE  HERE?
IT IS A PIPE GUN.
Stephen:  YOU COULD GO UP  TO A HIGH-VALUE TARGET.
HIGH-VALUE TARGET AND YOU  COULD SMOKE NEAR THEM FOR 20  YEARS AND KILL THEM WITH SECONDHAND SMOKE.
YOU COULD DO THAT, THAT'S ONE  WAY.
Stephen:  NO ONE WOULD SEE  THAT COMING.
NOT FOR 20 YEARS. THEY WOULDN'T KNOW UNTIL RIGHT  AT THE END. WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, STEPHEN, IS  A RECTAL CONCEALMENT DEVICE FOR  A CYANIDE CAPSULE. IT'S ANOTHER RECTAL CONCEALMENT  DEVICE.
Stephen:  YES, YES, I'M  AWARE OF THAT. I'M JUST-- THERE'S A LITTLE MORE  RECTAL ACTIVITY HERE THAN... ( LAUGHTER )  IS THERE NO OTHER PLACE TO HIDE  THINGS ON THE HUMAN BODY?
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT.
Stephen:  I'M THINKING  ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.
THINK ABOUT IT.
Stephen:  LET'S MOVE ON. I HAD LEARNED THE BASICS, BUT TO  COMPLETE MY TRAINING I FIRST HAD  TO COMPLETE A RISKY COCONVERT  MISSION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO  ME TODAY, PETER.
OKAY, IT WAS GREAT HAVING YOU  HERE, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  GOOD-BYE.
