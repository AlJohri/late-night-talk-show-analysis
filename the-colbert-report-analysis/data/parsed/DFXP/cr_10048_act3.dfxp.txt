WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT WORKS AT KFC  AND IS ORGANIZING WORKERS FOR A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE. AFTER THIS INTERVIEW, SHE'S GOING TO BE EXTRA CRISPY. PLEASE WELCOME NAQUASIA LEGRAND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. OKAY, LET'S TELL THE PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE A 22-YEAR-OLD WORKER AT KFC.
YES I AM.
Stephen: WHO HAS BEEN ORGANIZING FLASH STRIKES TO HELP PUSH FOR A 15 DOLLAR AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE AT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS, RIGHT? (APPLAUSE)
AND DON'T FORGET THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE WITHOUT RETALIATION.
Stephen: OK SO THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE WITHOUT RETALIATION.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: OKAY, AND THIS HAS LEAD TO, THE FIRST ONE WAS IN NOVEMBER OF 2012. AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE AT THAT ONE.
A GOOD HANDFUL, SAY 200, IT STARTED OFF.
Stephen: A YEAR LATER, YOU GUYS HELD THIS STRIKE AND THERE WERE STRIKES IN OVER 100 CITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, ORGANIZING FOR UNIONS IN FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS AND A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO SOMEONE IN YOUR INDUSTRY WITHOUT YELLING THE PHRASE HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO FRY SOMETHING, WHERE IS MY ORDER. OKAY, SO LET ME UNDERSTAND, LET ME UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM. YOU'RE EMPLOYED RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE AN HOUR?
WELL RIGHT NOW, I'M MAKING $8, FORTUNATELY BECAUSE FAST FOOD WORKERS LIKE US, YOU KNOW, STOOD UP AND HAD A VOICE, SO NOW I'M MAKING $8 AN HOUR.
Stephen: SO IT WAS 7.25 MINIMUM WAGE IN NEW YORK AND IT'S GONE TO $8 IN THE LAST YEAR.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: SO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT EXTRA 75 CENT AN HOUR IS PASSED ON TO A CONSUMER LIKE ME. AND I COULD BE PAYING MORE THAN 4 CENTS MORE FOR MY GO CUP, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE TAKE MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET WHEN YOU DO THAT.
HEY, THESE MULTIBILLION-DOLLARS COMPANIES ARE TAKING MONEY FROM OUR POCKETS TOO. I WORK AND GIVE THEM ALL THAT MONEY, I MEAN, THEY CAN AFFORD TO GIVE IT TO ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY, BUT YOU-- WHY NOT JUST WORK MORE. HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU WORK A WEEK.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, STEVE, STEVE, HOLD ON. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR PEOPLE TOLD YOU, I WORKED AT TWO KFCs AND STILL COULDN'T MAKE IT, STILL DIDN'T SEE THESE $300 A WEEK. I DID TWO KFCs, PROBABLY WORKED MAYBE 35 HOURS AT THE END OF THE WEEK BUT I STILL DIDN'T MAKE IT. I STILL HAVE A METROCARD I NEED, I STILL HAVE A FAMILY TO FEED, I STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE BILLS ARE PAID AT A CERTAIN TIME. AND I STILL COULD NOT DO THAT WITH WORKING TWO KFCs.
Stephen: OK SO YOU WERE WORKING AT TWO KFC'S. DO YOU STILL WORK AT TWO KFC's?
NO, SIR.
Stephen: ALRIGHT, SO.
SO NOW I'M ONLY MAKING $8, ONLY 15 HOURS A WEEK. SO-- YOU TELL ME, STEVE.
Stephen: WHY NOT DO TWO SHIFTS, WHY NOT GO TO OVER 30 HOURS A WEEK?
WHY NOT GO OVER 30 HOURS A WEEK, ASK MY MANAGER THAT, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: IT'S BEEN SAID THAT THE REQUIREMENT IN OBAMA CARE THAT ANYONE WHO WORKS MORE THAN 30 HOURS A WEEK HAS LED PLACES LIKE KFC WHERE YOU WORK TO KEEP PEOPLE TO PART-TIME SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY HEALTH CARE.
RIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY THESE CORPORATIONS DON'T WANT TO PAY. THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THAT HEALTH CARE SO THAT'S WHY THEY PUT PEOPLE UNDER 30 HOURS A WEEK.
Stephen: OKAY SO IT'S OBAMA'S FAULT.
IT'S OBAMA FAULT, NO, IT'S NOT OBAMA'S FAULT.
Stephen: BELIEVE ME, I YELLED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS AND IT ALWAYS FITS.
BUT IT STILL DOESN'T JUSTIFY THAT THESE CORPORATIONS MAKING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
Stephen: THESE CORPORATIONS ARE THERE TO MAKE MONEY, YOUNG LADY. (APPLAUSE) IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MORE MONEY WHY DIDN'T HAVE YOU THE FORESIGHT TO BE A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION. (LAUGHTER)
STEVE, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHY DO YOU NEED TO ORGANIZE? WHY CALL FOR UNIONS. UNIONS NEVER SOLVED ANYTHING OTHER THAN CHILD LABOR. WHAT IS IT?
YOU KNOW WHY, YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE ME AS THE ONLY-- ME, AS JUST BEING MY ONE VOICE, CAN'T GO TO MY MANAGER AND BE LIKE LISTEN, I WANT THESE SET DAYS, I WANT, THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY I WANT. NO, I HAVE TO COME WITH A TEAM, WITH MY COWORKERS AND OTHER WORKERS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND LET THEM KNOW IT'S NOT JUST ME WHO IS GOING THROUGH THIS. IT'S ALL OF US GOING THROUGH THIS. THAT IS WHAT MAKES A UNION. AMERICANS COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND HAVE A VOICE TOGETHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I AM, I AM A MAJOR STOCKHOLDER IN YUM FOODS WHICH OWNS KFC AND I KNOW YOU WANT MORE MONEY AND HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN DIGNITY. BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THOSE THINGS. (LAUGHTER) IF IT WILL COST ME MORE MONEY, IS THERE-- CAN WE MEET SOME PLACE IN THE MIDDLE? LIKE YOU HAVE DIGNITY BUT NOT HUMAN DIGNITY. OR HUMAN, BUT NOT DIGNITY.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, STEVE THERE IS NO COMPROMISE IN UNIONIZE, OKAY. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU SAY YOU SAY YOU'RE ONLY WORKING 15 HOURS A WEEK, RIGHT? RIGHT NOW.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: WHY NOT GET A SECOND JOB SOMEPLACE ELSE AND JUST WORK THERE WHEN YOU'RE NOT WORKING AT KFC?
BECAUSE MY MANAGER DON'T GIVE ME A SET SCHEDULE. IF I WANT TO HAVE THAT EXTRA INCOME, THERE IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD HAVE A SECOND JOB WHEN THESE MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR -- MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY ME FOR THE WORK THAT I DO. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A SECOND JOB.
Stephen: IT'S A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY IT'S A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY, YES, BUT LET'S KEEP IN MIND. THE CHAIRMAN IS ONLY MAKING $11 MILLION THIS YEAR. ARE YOU AT ALL AFRAID THAT THE COLONEL MIGHT COME AFTER YOU? CAUSE THAT GUY'S GOT MILITARY EXPERIENCE, YOU KNOW, HE CAN RIDE DOWN ON YOU ON A CALVARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
HEY, STEVE, I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME, I  ONLY MAKE 15 HOURS A WEEK. WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOSE. WHAT HE'S GOING TO CUT ME DOWN TO 10?
Stephen: HE COULD TAKE AWAY YOUR EXTRA CRISPY. BY THE WAY, I HAVE TO ASK ALL MY GUESTS THIS, ORIGINAL RECIPE OR EXTRA CRISPY?
ORIGINAL, BABY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, NEQUASIA LEGRAND. THE MOVEMENT IS FAST FOOD FORWARD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
