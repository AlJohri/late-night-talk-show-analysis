( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN NFL QUARTERBACK WITH A NEW X BOX GAME "PLAYOFF FACE-OFF." PLEASE WELCOME DREW BREES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO! WHOOO! ALL RIGHT! THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY-- THIS IS THE PERFECT WAY TO FINISH OUR SUPERB OWL COVERAGE. THIS WEEK. BECAUSE--   ( CHEERS ) YOU YOU'RE A SUPER BOWL CHAMPION, SUPER BOWL MVP, EIGHT-TIME PRO BOWLER, QUARTERBACK FOR THE NEW ORLEANS SAINTS. 2013 WAS YOUR RECORD 5,000 YARD PASSING SEASON. AND LET'S FACE IT-- IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE QUARTERBACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). RIGHT?
I GUESS SO.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. YOU-- AS A QUARTERBACK, YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE IN-- ON THE BIG GAME, IF I CAN CALL IT THAT.
SURE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  WHAT ARE THESE TWO QUARTERBACKS THINKING RIGHT NOW?
WELL, PEYTON'S BEEN IN THIS SITUATION A FEW TIMES. SO I'M SURE HE'S KIND OF GOT IT DOWN TO A SCIENCE. HE --
Stephen:  AT THIS POINT, IT'S ONLY THURSDAY.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  DO YOU JUST WANT THE GAME TO BE TOMORROW? YOU KNOW YOUR GAME STRATEGY AT THIS POINT.
RIGHT, EXACTLY. IT CAN'T GET HERE FAST ENOUGH AT THIS POINT. THERE'S SO MUCH CHATTER AROUND YOU. YOU'VE HAD REALLY TWO WEEKS TO PREPARE FOR IT, NOT JUST ONE WEEK. SO YOU'RE CONSTANTLY GOING THROUGH THE GAME PLAN OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL FINALLY IT'S LIKE, "MAN, I'VE WATCHED THIS PLAY 1,000 TIMES. I'VE READ THROUGH THIS PLAY 1,000 TIMES. LET'S JUST GO PLAY THE GAME."
Stephen:  ARE YOU STARING IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR GOING, I'M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD. I'M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD. IME"" GOING TO DISNEY WORLD. I'M GOING TO DISNEYLAND, EITHER ONE. ( BLEEP ) I'LL GO TO EPCOT. JUST LET ME WIN.
DISNEYLAND ALWAYS GETS NEGLECTED IT REALLY DOES.
THAT'S A SHAME.
Stephen:  NOT TO PICK A WOUND HERE, BUT THE SAINT LOST TO SEATTLE, OKAY, AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THERE? WHO ARE YOU PULLING FOR? ARE YOU PULLING FOR SEATTLE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE BEEN BEATEN BY THE BEST OR ARE YOU PULLING FOR THE BRONCOS BECAUSE YOU WANT SEATTLE TO SHARE YOUR PAIN? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO WATCH GOLF ALL DAY SUNDAY?
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO WATCH FOOTBALL BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF THE GAME, AND I LOVE THESE TWO QUARTERBACKS. AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I WOULD NOT BET AGAINST EITHER OF THEM.
Stephen:  REALLY?
YEAH. AND I COULD GIVE YOU ARGUMENTS FOR BOTH SIDES. I THINK PEYTON MANNING'S CAREER, NUMBER ONE, WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED IS REMARKABLE, WHAT HE DID THIS YEAR WAS UNPRECEDENTED. WHAT HE'S OVERCOME OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH HIS NECK INJURY AND KIND OF HIS-- YOU KNOW, REALLY STARTING FRESH IN DENVER IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY HAVE TO TIP YOUR HAT TO. I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR HIM AS A PLAYER AND WHAT HE'S BROUGHT TO THE GAME. RUSSELL WILSON, I'M NOT SURE THERE'S A GUY IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS THAT HAS THE SUCCESS HE HAS AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE IT THE WAY HE HAS. HE'S MATURE BEYOND HIS YEARS. HE'S A TRUE PRO. THE MORE SUCCESS THAT COMES HIS WAY THE MORE HUMBLE HE BECOMES. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT APPROACH, AND I THINK THAT BOTH OF THEM CERTAINLY ARE READY FOR THIS MOMENT.
Stephen:  SO WHO'S GOING TO WIN? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) COME ON, DREW! GROW A PAIR. I HAD JUSTIN TUCK HERE ON TUESDAY NIGHT, AND HE-- HE LOVES HITTING PEOPLE FOR A LIVING, ALL RIGHT. I LOOKED IT UP. HE'S NEVER SACKED YOU. HE'S NEVER SACKED YOU.
LET'S KEEP IT THIS WAY.
Stephen:  HE LIKES TO KIND OF LIKE WOUNDED FOREST ANIMAL SOUND QUARTERBACKS MAKE WHEN YOU HIT THEM. LIKE THE HUUUH SOUND THEY MAKE. HOW DO YOU AS A QUARTERBACK GET BACK INTO THE POCKET? YOU HAVE, LIKE, THREE SECONDS, YOU CAN SEE THIS MUCH, AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOUR, 300-POUND ANGRY POT ROASTS COMING AT YOU?
RIGHT ERIGHT.
Stephen:  HOW DO YOU STAY FOCUSED IN THAT TINY COMPRESSED ZONE?
UH, IT'S KIND DIFFICULT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TREMENDOUS TRUST FOR THE GUYS IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE I'VE GOT FIVE BIG POT ROASTS BLOCKING THEIR FOUR-- FOR THEIR FOUR POT ROASTS. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE COMING VERY CLOSE TO YOU. THEY'RE THERE TO TAKE YOUR HEAD OFF. AND YET YOU STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN YOUR POISE AND YOU'VE GOT A JOB TO DO. YOU HAVE TO DELIVER BALL DOWN THE FIELD. THAT'S YOUR JOB.
Stephen:  I GOT TRAINED ADD A QUARTERBACK THIS WEEK FOR-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WERE TRYING TO TEACH ME WAS QUARTERBACKS OWN THE ROOM. HOW DO YOU OWN THE ROOM?
YOU HAVE COMMAND. YOU'RE PREPARED. YOU'RE READY FOR ANY SITUATION.
Stephen:  IS THIS IT? ARE YOU OWNING THE ROOM RIGHT NOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S-- IT'S A QUIET CONFIDENCE. ( LAUGHTER )  YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YOU'RE OWNING IT. YOU'RE OWNING IT. YOU HAD THE WHO DAT NATION.
Stephen:  THERE'S CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE WHO DAT NATION AND THE COLBERT NATION. HOW MANY HODATS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. HOW MANY COLBERT NATIONS? YOU'RE THE FACE OF AN X-BOX GAME CALLED "PLAYOFF FACE-OFF." WHAT IS "PLAYOFF FACE-OFF"?
IT ALLOWS YOU TO BE MORE INTERACTIVE THAN YOU EVER HAVE BEFORE. IT ALLOWS YOU TO WATCH THE GAME YOUS YOU WANT TO WATCH, TRACK YOUR FANTASY STATS AND PREDICT THE GAMES IN THE PLAY-OFF, INCLUDING THE SUPER BOWL WITH A CHANCE TO WIN TICKETS TO NEXT YEAR'S SUPER BOWL.
Stephen:  HOW HARD CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME? ( LAUGHTER ).
FOR-- FOR-- YOU KNOW HOW LONG YOU PRACTICED TO BE A QUARTERBACK EARLIER?
Stephen:  YEAH.
THAT LONG?
REALLY.
Stephen:  ALMOST 45 MINUTE.
ALMOST 45 MINUTES.
Stephen:  DREW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. NEW ORLEANS SAINTS QUARTERBACK DREW BREES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
