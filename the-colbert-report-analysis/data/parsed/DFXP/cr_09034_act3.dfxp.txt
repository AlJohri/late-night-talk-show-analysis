WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  DIRECTOR OF THE HOBBIT. WHICH TAKES PLACE IN A  BEAUTIFUL IMAGINARY WORLD  CALLED NEW ZEALAND. PLEASE WELCOME PETER  JACKSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOW ARE YOU.
Stephen: SIT DOWN. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YEAH, THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND IT IS AGAIN.
IT IS, I KNOW.
Stephen: BECAUSE A YEAR  AND A HALF AGO YOU INVITED  ME AND MY FAMILY DOWN TO THE  SET.
I DID IN NEW ZEALAND.
I DID.
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE A  QUESTION. I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW  THAT FOR THE RECORD.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: I HUNG OUT DOWN  TLRB, IT WAS AWESOME.
YOU HUNG OUT.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT  WHAT YOU DID TO MAKE THIS  FILM. FIRST OF ALL, WHY DID YOU GO  3-D ON THIS THING. BECAUSE I SAW IT ON FRICHLT  AND I DON'T-- FIRST OF ALL,  DOW SELL INSURANCE TO YOUR AUDIENCE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT  NEED IT YOU GOT TO STRAP IN  FOR THIS FILM IT TAKES YOU FOR A RIDE.
GREAT, YEAH, WELL, I MEAN,  LOOK AS A DIRECTOR I'VE  ALWAYS LIKED TO KIND OF TAKE PEOPLE FROM THEIR SEATS AND  LET THEM KIND OF COME INTO  THE SCREEN AND BE PART OF THE ACTION. I ALWAYS TRY TO DO THAT JUST  WITH THE STYLE THAT I DIRECT  AND THE LENSES I USE. SO 3-D IS A GIFT.
Stephen: YOU ALREADY SHOT  THE 3 FILMS. WHY WAIT, WHY WAIT ANOTHER  YEAR FOR THE NEXT ONE. WHY NOT JUST SHOW ME THE  NEXT ONE NOW.
OKAY, WELL, I TELL YOU  WHAT, I'M THE ONLY PERSON,  HE IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT, WE ARE THE ONLY PERSON THAT  HAVE SEEN THE SECRETARY  FILM. I GOT MOST OF IT CUT BEFORE  I CAME OVER HERE. AND I SAID DOW GUYS WANT TO  HAVE A LOOK AT THE SECOND  FILM. THIS WAS A FEW DAYS AGO BUT  THEY WERE TOO BUSY SELECTING  FOR THE PREMIER THEY SAID NO, NO, WE'LL JUST SEE, YOU CAN  BELIEVE THAT I OFFERED THEM  A CHANCE TO SEE IT.
Stephen: WELL, CAN  YOU-- I WON'T DO MY HAIR, I  PROMISE. DID YOU BRING IT WITH YOU? DO YOU HAVE ONE ON A THUMB  DRIVE SO I CANNING LOCK THE  DOOR AND LOCK YOU OUT AND TAKE IT.
OKAY, GREAT. WHEN I DO COME OVER? I WON'T TELL ANYONE EXCEPT  THE 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE ON MY  TWITTER FEED.
WE'LL HAVE A TALK ABOUT  THAT AFTER.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. THIS IS SO AMAZING-- NEW  ZEALAND IS SO AMAZINGABLYLY  BEAUTIFUL. THESE FILMS SO SO IMPORTANT  TO YOUR HOME COUNTRY. YOU GREW NEWSPAPER  WELLINGTON.
YUP.
Stephen: YOU TURNED IT  INTO WELLIE WOOD. ARE YOU SOME GUY WALK AROUND  IN HIS OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THAT  INCREDIBLE S THAT AS  SATISFYING AS MAKING ITS  MOVIES THAT YOU MANAGED TO DO IT WHERE YOU WANT TO DO  IT?
YEAH, I MEAN LOOK I WAS  VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I'M A  KIWI. I LIVE THERE AND I LOVE  WORKING THERE. WE'VE GOT FANTASTIC CREWS. AND WE JUST HAPPENED TO BE  THE LUCKY FILMMAKERS THAT  ENDED UP DOING LORD OF THE RINGS IN THE MOST PER SPEC  COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO  SHOOT IT I OFTEN SAID IF ANY OTHER DIRECT NEVER THE WORLD  WAS DOING THE LORD OF THE  RINGS NEW ZE LAN WAS  PROBABLY THE LOCATION THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO.
Stephen: IT LOOKS LIKE  YOU BUILT IT TO MAKE THE  MOVIE.
I CAN OPEN MY BACKYARD  AND WALK OUT INTO THE YARD.
Stephen: DID YOU THINK OF  ANY OTHER TECHNICAL  INNOVATIONS THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO USE IN LORD OF THE  RINGS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR  THE HOBBIT. FOR INSTANCE, THE SCENE WITH  GOLLUM, HE IS IN SOME WAYS  BETTER EVEN THAN HE WAS IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS WHAT  IS DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM. I CAN TELL SOMETHING.
WELL, THERE ARE TWO  THINGS. PHYSICALLY HE'S GOT MORE  MUSCLES IN HIS FACE, GOLLUM,  ANDY SERKIS HAS THE SAME  MUSCLES THAT HE HAD 10 YEARS  AGO. A LITTLE OLDER AND MORE  FLABBY THOUGH. BUT GOLLUM WE'VE PUT MORE  MUSS PELLS UNDER HIS SKIN  AROUND HIS EYES AND MOUTH SO THAT EVERY SUBTLE EXPRESSION  THAT ANDY MAKES CAN BE  ACCURATELY REPLICATED IN THE GOLLUM PUPPET WHICH MAKES  THE FORM OF CAPTURE  ACCURATE.
Stephen: IT IS AN  INCREDIBLE SCENE. THE WHOLE MOVIE IS DAZZLING  BUT THAT SCENE ITSELF I  THINK IS AS GOOD OR BETTER  THAN ANYTHING IN THE LORD OF THE RINGS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT  HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE  FACT THAT PROFESSOR TOLKIEN HIMSELF WENT BACK AND WROTE  THAT SCENE AFTER HE FINISHED  THE LORD OF THE RINGS. HE WENT AND REWROTE THAT  KAPTUR.
HE REVISED IT, DIDN'T HE.
Stephen: OF THE RIDDLES  IN THE DARK CHAPTER. SO IT HAS LIKE A DARKER  QUALITY TO IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: THAN THE REST OF  THE BOOK.
IT DOES. AND I THINK, I MEAN TOLKIEN  FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU  SHOULD TELL ME, ACTUALLY. THE APPENDICES AT THE END OF  THE RETURN OF THE KING, WERE  THEY KIND OF LIKE NOTES THAT HE WAS PREPARING TO DO A  REVISED VERSION OF THE  HOBBIT. THERE WAS A STORY I HEARD.
Stephen: THE QUESTION WAS  I THINK HE FINISHED THE LORD  OF THE RINGS AND THEN HE LOOKED BACK AT THE HOBBIT  AND HE SAID WELL, THE HOBBIT  WAS PROBABLY, BECAUSE HE LOOKED AT THINGS SHALL, LIKE  WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THIS  DOCUMENT THAT I'M SUPPOSEDLY TRANSLATING INTO ENGLISH. AND HE SAID WELL, WHY IS THE  HOBBIT A CHILDREN'S STORY. AND HE THOUGHT OH, OKAY,  SOMEONE TURNED IT INTO A  CHILDREN'S STORY ALTHOUGH  MUCH MORE MATURE STORY. AH THERE MUST BE ANOTHER  DOCUMENT THAT TELLS IT IN  THE SAME STYLE OF THE LORD  OF RINGS. I WILL GO WRITE THAT.
OKAY.
Stephen: AN THEN HE GOT A  WAYS INTO IT AND THEY SAID  THIS IS NICE BUT IT'S NOT THE HOBBIT. SOW STOPPED.
I'M SO GLAD I CAME ON  THIS SHOW. THAT IS A QUESTION I HAVE  BEEN WONDERING FOR QUITE A  FEW YEARS.
Stephen: I THINK THAT'S  THE TRUTH.
YEAH, RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. LAST QUESTION, YOU GOT TO GO  BE A FAMOUS DIRECTOR. BUT DO YOU HAVE A CAMEO IN  THIS ONE?
I DO.
Stephen: I COULDN'T FIND  YOU.
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, YAY! I GOT ONE OVER YOU,  FANTASTIC. I'M IN THE FIRST SIX OR  SEVEN MINUTES IN THE MOVIE  BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO SEE IT  AGAIN, YOU SEE.
Stephen: I THINK I WILL. I THINK I WILL. PETER JACKSON, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: PETER JACKSON,  THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOBBIT. OFF WITH YOU NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
