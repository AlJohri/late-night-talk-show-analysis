STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: VERY NICE. VERY NICE. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. VERY GOOD PEOPLE.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT WAS DONE WITH ALL THE  PRECISION OF A SYNCHRONIZED SWIM  TEAM. IF SWIM TEAMS CHANTED AND THERE  WAS NO WATER. YOU WATCH THE NEWS. PEOPLE SAY THE ECONOMY IS IN  DUMPS. I DON'T KNOW. I'M DOING OKAY. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STOCK  MARKET IS NEAR RECORD HIGHS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THOSE  UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET  THEIR OWN HEDGE FUND. OF COURSE NO MATTER HOW STRONG  IT SEEMS THE MARKET CAN  SOMETIMES OVERREACT TO BAD NEWS AND YESTERDAY THE DOW WAS A BIT  OF A DRAMA QUEEN! JIM?
IF YOU BLINK YOU MISSED IT. WE HAD A MINI-FLASH CRASH THIS  HOUR.
THE DOW JONES AVERAGE FELL  NEARLY 150 POINTS IN TWO  MINUTES. THE MARKET REGAINED THE LOSSES  FIVE MINUTES LATER.
Stephen: FOR INVESTORS LIKE  ME, IT WAS A REAL ROLER COASTER  RIDE. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I BLEW $16  FOR THE SOUVENIR PHOTO. NOW EVEN MORE UNNERVING WAS WHAT  CAUSED THE CRASH.
TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE  ASSOCIATED PRESS TWEETED ABOUT  EXPLOSIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND INJURIES TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THAT IMMEDIATELY SENT WALL  STREET OFF INTO A TAILSPIN FOR A  DRAMATIC FEW MINUTES.
TO HAVE THAT KIND OF IMPACT  FROM A 140 CHARACTER TWEET, THAT  IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIGNIFICANT.
Stephen: NOW, IT TURNED OUT  TO BE FALSE INFORMATION. STILL IT WAS THE MOST  EARTH-SHATTERING TWEET SINCE THE  TWIT-PIC OF DAN KISSING ALI WHEN HE'S STILL DATING JESSICA. I MEAN HASH TAG MAN SLUT. IT TURNS OUT THE A.P.'S TWITTER  FEED WAS HACKED BY A GROUP  CALLING ITSELF THE SYRIAN ELECTRONIC ARMY. I SAW THEM AT BONNAROO IN 2006. THEY'RE AMAZING. ANYWAY, IT FOOLED WALL STREET  BUT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND,  THESE TRADERS ON WALL STREET ARE ONLY HUMAN. EXCEPT THIS ONE TIME.
HUMAN BEINGS WEREN'T MAKING  THESE TRADES. THESE WERE COMPUTERS. ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO SCAN THE  HEADLINES AND FIND NEGATIVE OR  POSITIVE WORDS AND THEN HELP COMPANIES PROFIT ON THE RESULTS.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR KEY WORDS  LIKE EXPLOSION, WHITE HOUSE,  PRESIDENT, OBAMA. THEY READ THOSE WORDS IN THAT  FAKE A.P. TWEET AND IMMEDIATELY  TRIGGERED MASSIVE SELLING OF  STOCK. NO HUMAN BEINGS INVOLVED  WHATSOEVER.
Stephen: NATION, THIS IS A  MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN COMPUTING. WE NOW HAVE MACHINES THAT CAN  RECEIVE BAD NEWS AND FLIP THEIR [BLEEP] MILLIONS OF TIMES FASTER  THAN ANY HUMAN BEING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OF COURSE, I'M NOT SURPRISED BY  THE POWER OF TWITTER. I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN TWEETING FOR  YEARS AT STEPHEN AT HOME. AND BEING A MASTER, I RECENTLY  FOUND A YOUNG PADAWAN TO TWAIN  IN THE WAYS OF THE TWITTER. JIM?
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF OPENING  YOU A TWITTER ACCOUNT. PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS TAKEN. WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON WAS  TAKEN. BUT PREZBILLY JEFF WAS  AVAILABLE.
JUST SPENT AMAZING TIME WITH  COLBERT. IS HE SANE? HE IS COOL.
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS ONE  OF THOSE MOMENTS WE WILL LOOK  BACK ON AND SAY, "THAT ALTERED THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY."  LIKE MAN DISCOVERING FIRE, THE  VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS OR THE UNKNOWN GENIUS WHO SAW A TACO  AND THOUGHT, "WHAT IF THIS WAS  CHOCO?"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND, FOLKS, SINCE THAT HISTORIC  FIRST TWEET, THE NUMBER OF AT  PREZBILLY JEFF'S TWEETS HAS ROCKETED TO STILL JUST THAT ONE  TWEET. I MEAN, COME ON! WHAT IS UP? COME ON, P.B.J., YOU HAVE TO  CAPITALIZE ON THE TWEET-MENTUM. IF YOU DON'T USE IT, YOU'LL LOSE  IT. JUST LIKE THE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE  SO FULL OF IT. IT'S GRAY. IT'S WHATEVER. HEAD MEAT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST GOING TO REMIND HIM TO  TWEET BY TWEETING HIM ON  TWITTER. OKAY. HERE WE GO. AT PREZBILLY JEFF. MISSED YOU SUNDAY AT MY GAME OF  THRONES PARTY. ALSO, WHY NO TWEETS? HASH TAG: DRAGONS ARE REAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, I'LL CHECK BACK LATER  TONIGHT TO SEE IF HE'S  RESPONDED. OH, HE'S ALREADY TWEETED ME  BACK. LET'S SEE. SORRY I COULDN'T MAKE IT AT  STEVEN AT HOME. I'VE BEEN BUSY WITH AT CLINTON  FOUNDATION WORK ON GLOBAL  HEALTH. THURSDAY IS HASH TAG WORLD  MALARIA DAY, YOU KNOW, HASH TAG  RAIN CHECK. WOW.

WELL, ACTUALLY, STEPHEN, I'M  FREE RIGHT NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: PRESIDENT BILL  CLINTON, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.
I WANT TO THANK YOU, STEPHEN,  FORGETTING ME STARTED ON  TWITTER.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR. THANKS FOR THE COLBERT BUMP AT  PREZBILLY JEFF ALREADY HAS  170,000 FOLLOWERS. THAT'S BIG. I MEAN I HAVE ALMOST FIVE  MILLION FOLLOWERS BUT WHO IS  COUNTING?
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE. tephen: YOU BET I AM. IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING, WHY  HAVEN'T YOU TWEETED MORE?
WELL, STEPHEN, I'M NOT SURE I  HAVE ROOM IN MY SCHEDULE TO  TWEET.
Stephen: SIR, THERE IS ALWAYS  ROOM FOR TWITTER. IT'S THE JELLO OF HUMAN  EXPRESSION. YOU CAN DO IT DURING ANY DOWN  TIME LIKE WHEN YOU'RE STANDING  IN LINE AT THE BANK OR WHEN YOU'RE WAITING AT A DRIVE  THROUGH OR WHEN YOU'RE GOING  THROUGH SECURITY AT THE AIRPORT. AND AS I'M SAYING THIS, I  REALIZE NONE OF THESE THINGS  APPLY TO YOU, DO THEY?
NOT REALLY, NO. Stephen: OKAY. WELL, REGARDLESS. YOU'VE GOT TO GET ON THERE. BUT A WARNING, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN THE LEADER OF  THE FREE WORLD BUT TWITTER HAS  ITS OWN SUPER POWERS. FOR INSTANCE, THIS IS JUSTIN  BIEBER.
YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY MET  JUSTIN BIEBER. HE SEEM LIKE A NICE YOUNG MAN.
Stephen: DON'T LET THE  ANGELIC FACE FOOL YOU. HE'S LIKE KIM JUNG-UN BUT WITH A  MORE FAN AT CAL FAN BASE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THERE'S YOUR KIM, YOUR COURTNEY,  CHRIS, KUR BUNGLE, KRISPY KREME.
STEPHEN, I APPRECIATE ALL  THIS BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL  TWEET A LOT OF CELEBRITIES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK IN  MY FOUNDATION AND THE WORK IN  HEALTH CARE AND REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING AND PROMOTING ECONOMIC  GROWTH.
Stephen: I'VE HEARD THAT  STUFF TOO. MY ISSUE IS WORLD HUNGER. I ADDRESS THAT MOSTLY BY  TWEETING INSTA GRAMS OF MY  BREAKFAST WITH HASH TAG. BY THE WAY, SIR, DO YOU KNOW  ABOUT HASH TAGS.
GREAT. Stephen: LET ME TELL YOU  ABOUT THEM. HASH TAGS ARE AMAZING. YOU JUST SMOOSH TOGETHER A  COUPLE OF WORDS, PUT A POUND  SIGN IN FRONT OF IT AND SUDDENLY IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE PART OF A  WORLDWIDE MOMENT.
ACTUALLY I AM PART OF A  WORLDWIDE MOVEMENT.
Stephen: YEAH, IT'S CALLED  TWITTER. FROM NOW ON, HISTORY WILL  REMEMBER YOU AS AT PREZBILLY  JEFF. CONGRATULATIONS SIR.
NOW ABOUT THAT NAME. I KIND OF WISH YOU HAD PICKED  SOMETHING JUST A TAD MORE  DIGNIFIED, SOMETHING LIKE AT BILL CLINTON, FOR INSTANCE.
Stephen: SIR, I TRIED TO GET  AT BILL CLINTON BUT SOME JERK  ALREADY TOOK IT. IF I EVER FIND OUT WHO, I SWEAR,  I AM GOING TO JUST...
I TOOK IT. Stephen: ... TELL HIM HE IS A  GREAT STATESMAN AND A GREAT  AMERICAN.
YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN PLANNING  ON LAUNCHING MY TWITTER PAGE FOR  QUITE A WHILE. NOW THAT YOU'VE PRIMED THE PUMP  I'M REALLY READY TO GO.
Stephen: OKAY. SO, NATION, IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING  AT PREZBILLY JEFF, SWITCH OVER  TO THE NEW HANDLE AT BILL  CLINTON. IN FACT, SIR, YOU KNOW, YOU MAY  HAVE ALMOST 5 MILLION FOLLOWERS  BUT I DON'T FOLLOW ANYONE. BUT TONIGHT I WILL START  FOLLOWING YOU RIGHT NOW.
THANKS, STEPHEN. I NEED IT.
Stephen: YES, YOU DO. NOW, LET'S MAKE HISTORY. WITH YOUR HISTORIC SECOND FIRST  TWEET.
