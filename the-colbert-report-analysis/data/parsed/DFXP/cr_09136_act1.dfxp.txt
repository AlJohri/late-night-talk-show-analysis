Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  SHOW, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NATION, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO  THE TOP STORY TONIGHT-- ME. ( LAUGHTER )  THE WORLD IS ABUZZ OVER LAST  NIGHT'S SHOW. IT WAS MY THIRD ANNUAL  COLBCHELLA CONCERT SERIES AND IT  WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE THIRD TIME WE HAVE DONE IT. ( LAUGHTER )  MY STAR-STUDDED VIDEO TRIBUTE TO  THE SONG OF THE SUMMER LIT UP  THE TWITTERSPHERE, THOUGH I DO HAVE TO SAY, I AM A LITTLE HURT  THAT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH PEOPLE  HAVE CONGRATULATED ME ON THE HEIGHT OF MY CHORUS LINE KICK  WITH THE ROCKETTES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YES. I AM DEEPLY HURT IN THAT I  BELIEVE I TORE MY HAMS STRING. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, FOLKS, IF YOU WEREN'T HERE  LAST NIGHT, YOU'RE PROBABLY IN  DAFT PUNK. ( LAUGHTER )  THESE GUYS-- THEY WERE A NO-SHOW  BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED EXCLUSIVE  AGREEMENT TO APPEAR ON MTV, I ASSUME BECAUSE THEY'RE 16 AND  PREGNANT. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT IT TURNS OUT, IT TURNS OUT--  THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT-- BUT IT  TURNS OUT, AS I EXPLAINED IN MINUTE DETAIL LAST NIGHT, THAT  ARE SURPRISE GUESTS AT THIS  YEAR'S VMA'S, SO REMEMBER TO ACT  SURPRISED. BUT IT ALL TURNED OUT GREAT  BECAUSE ROBIN THICKE SHOWED UP  AT THE LAST MINUTE TO KICK IT WILD STYLE. END OF STORY, OR SO I THOUGHT. UNTIL SOME SHARP-EYED  JOURNALISTS OVER AT THE INDY  MUSIC SITE PITCHFORK QUESTIONED THE HONESTY OF MY EXPLANATION  SARCASTICALLY USING, "MAYBE  ROBIN THICKE, HIS DANCERS AND BAND WERE ABLE TO PULL OFF AN  ELABORATE PERFORMANCE TWO HOURS'  NOTICE OR MAYBE IT WAS THE PLAN ALL ALONG, AN ELABORATE FAKE-OUT  TO PROMOTE DAFT PUNK'S  APPEARANCE ON THE VMA'S. I GOT ONE THING TO SAY TO  PITCHFORK-- BUSTED! YOU GOT ME! THEY'RE GOOD. WE THOUGHT WE TRICKED YOU BY  FLYING IN THE DISCO DECEPTICONS  FROM PARIS IN A IT SOPHISTICATE PANTOMIME TO FOOL EVERYONE, EVEN  MYSELF, SO COMMITTED WAS I. THAT DAFT PUNK WAS COMING. ALL-- ALL JUST TO HELP SOMEONE  ELSE'S SHOW ON ANOTHER NETWORK A  MONTH FROM NOW. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT WE CAN'T PUT ONE PAST YOU,  PITCH FORNG. OH, WHAT A LOAD OFF. THE GUILT WAS KILLING ME. AND NOW THAT I'VE COME CLEAN, I  CAN JUST DO WHAT I LOVE, PROMOTE  THE VMAs. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WHICH ONCE AGAIN-- THANK YOU. IT'S MY CALLING. ONCE AGAIN, THE VMAs THE  APPEAR ON THE OPRAH WINFREY  NETWORK, FOLLOWING THE PREMIERE OF "HYSTERECTOMY HORRORS" WITH  HOST LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS. SET YOUR VC Cs. NATION, IT PAINS ME, THAT IN A  COUNTRY OF SUCH WEALTH AS OURS,  THERE ARE STILL SO MANY IN POVERTY, AND IT PAINS ME EVEN  MORE WHEN THOSE PEOPLE WON'T  STOP WHIENG ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER )  "I WANT A UNION. I I WANT SAFETY REGULATIONS. I NEED ALL MY FINGERS."  ( LAUGHTER )  AND NOW THAT WHINING IS COMING  WITH A SIDE OF FRIES.
WALKOUTS BY FAST FOOD WORKERS  ARE SPREADING AROUND THE  COUNTRY. THIS WEEK THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES  HAVE GONE ON STRIKE FOR A DAY. THE MOVEMENT IS ABOUT MONEY.
EMPLOYEES FROM MCDONALD'S,  WENDY'S ANY OTHER CHAINS WANT  THEIR WAGES DOUBLED TO 15 BUCKS.
Stephen:  $15 AN HOUR. WHAT DO THEY THINK, THOSE ARCHES  ARE MADE OF GOLD? THE CONSEQUENCES, FOLKS, THE  CONSEQUENCES OF A WAGE INCREASE  ARE HORRIFYING TO CONTEMPLATE. AT LAST COUNT THERE WERE 3.6  MILLION FRONT LINE CASHIERS,  COOK AND CREW IN AMERICA'S FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. A LIVING WAGE WOULD ELIMINATE  3.6 MILLION POOR PEOPLE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING HITLER  USED TO TALK ABOUT. IF ONLY SOMEONE HAD BEEN AROUND  GIVE HIM A HAPPY MEAL. LAYOFF LAUGH AND I'M NOT THE  ONLY ONE WITH MAXIMUM RAGE OVER  THE MINIMUM WAGE, SO IS FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND BURST TUBE OF  PILLSBURY CRESCENT ROLLS SO IS  NEIL CAVUTO.
DIEVER TELL YOU WHEN I WAS A  KID YOU WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR  ANY JOB YOU COULD FIND. NOW A LOT OF KIDS TURN UP THEIR  NOSES AT FAST FOOD JOBS AND GO  BEGGING AT $11. A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD BE HAPPY  WITH ANY WAGE, ANY TIME.
Stephen:  NEIL AND I ARE  NOT FIXATED ON OUR HOURLY WAGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I MAKE AN  HOUR. THAT MANY ZEROS GIVES ME  VERTIGO. I WANT TO SUPPORT HIM IN MY NEW  SEGMENT, "RICH WHITE GUYS  AGREEING WITH EACH OTHER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FOLKS, IF YOU'RE OUT OF WORK,  YOU GET UP OFF YOUR SESAME SEED BUNS AND TAKE ANYTHING YOU CAN  GET. JUST LISTEN TO NEIL'S INSPIRING  STORY.
ALL I KNOW IS AS SOON AS I  TURNED 16 AND HEARD THAT A FAST  FOOD CHAIN CALLED ARTHUR TREACHER WAS OPENING A STORR IN  MY DOWN IN DANBURY, CONNECTICUT,  I STOOD IN LINE FOR A POSITION, ANY POSITION. I I GOT THE JOB, AND SOON  ROCKETED TO RELIEF MANAGERS THEN  WEEKEND MANAGER AND THEN BY THE TENDER AGE OF 16 AND A HALF  YEARS OLD FULL-BLOWN MANAGER. IT ALL STARTED AT 2 BUCKS AN  HOUR.
Stephen:  YOU HEAR THAT  STRIKERS-- NEIL MADE $2 AN HOUR  AT AGE 16 AND SOMEHOW STILL PAID HIS RENT AND FED HIS KIDS. ( LAUGHTER )  AND YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I KNOW  WHERE ?EEL'S COMING FROM BECAUSE  WHEN I WAS YOUNG I HAD A LOW-PAYING JOB LOSING TEETH FOR  A LIVING. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  BUT WITH HARD WORK--  ( APPLAUSE )  YEAH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH HARD WORK AND A LITTLE  DUMPSTER DIVING OUTSIDE A HOCKEY  RINK I TURNED IT INTO A PROFITABLE BUSINESS, AND TODAY  YOU MAY KNOW THAT TOOTH LOSS  BUSINESS AS THE "COLBERT REPORT."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT RIGHT IN  HERE. I JUST WISH I KNEW WHO THAT  MAGICAL TOOTH FAIRY WAS SO I  COULD THANK FOR HER FOR MAKING ME INDEPENDENT OF MY PARENTS. PLEASE WELCOME THE HEAD OF THE  SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL  UNION MARY KAY HENRY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS  STRAIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE THESE  PEOPLE STRIKING? THE PEOPLE IN FAST FOOD  SHOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE GETTING  RICH. THEY'RE JUST TEENAGERS WORKING  PART-TIME JOBS.
28-YEAR-OLD IS THE AVERAGE  AGE OF THESE JOBS. THESE JOBS ARE NOW THE JOBS THAT  ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT  LOST GOOD MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS BEFORE THE RECESSION, AND  THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET  AND ARE MAKING A DEMAND TO MAKE THESE BAD, LOW-WAGE JOBS, GOOD  MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS SO WE CAN GET  THE ECONOMY GOING AGAIN.
Stephen:  BUT WHY SHOULD  THIS CORPORATION HAVE TO PAY  THESE PEOPLE MORE THAN MINIMUM  WAGE? ISN'T IT UP TO THESE PEOPLE TO  PULL THEMSELVES UP BY THEIR OWN  FRY BASKETS. ( LAUGHTER )
THESE CORPORATIONS ARE MAKING  MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE A  PROBLEM WITH THAT. YOU UNION PEOPLE-- LET'S CALL A  SPADE A SPADE HERE. I'M USING A BAD WORD HERE AND I  KNOW IT MIGHT OFFEND YOU, YOU'RE  IN A UNION. YOU UNION PEOPLE HATE CAPITALISM  AND HATE BUSINESS.
WE'RE PROUD TO STAND WITH THE  FAST FOOD WORKERS ASKING  CORPORATIONS MAKING RECORD PROFITS TO PAY THEM A LIVING  WAGE. $5.5 BILLION IN PROFITS FROM  McDONALD'S JUST THIS PAST  YEAR. AND WORKERS CAN'T-- ARE WORK  HARD AND CAN'T EVEN MAKE ENDS  MEET. THAT'S WRONG.
Stephen:  OKAY, THEN GET A  DIFFERENT JOB.
THERE ARE NO OTHER JOBS TO  GET. AND WE CANNOT HAVE A STRONG  ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE UNITED  STATES IF WORKERS DON'T HAVE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS SO THEY  CAN BUY GOODS AND SERVICES SO  THOSE COMPANIES CAN HIRE MORE PEOPLE AND WE CAN HAVE AN  ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY  IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT JUST THE  CORPORATIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THESE PEOPLE ARE  CLEARLY ON MY SIDE BECAUSE YOU  SAID THE WORD "CORPORATIONS" AND THEY STARTED CLAPPING. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU WANT THESE PEOPLE ORGANIZED  AND IN YOUR UNION.
NO.
Stephen:  YOU DON'T WANT  THEM. SAY IT RIGHT NOW, "DON'T JOIN MY  UNION."
THE MEMBERS OF OUR UNION WANT  THESE WORKERS TO SUCCEED. THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY  CAN TO MAKE SURE FAST FOOD  WORKERS GET $15 AN HOUR BECAUSE IT WILL MEAN ALL THE WAGE CAN  RISE IN THIS COUNTRY AGAIN.
Stephen:  WON'T THAT MEAN  THE SERVICE JOBS, THE GUY  FLIPPING THE BURGERS, AREN'T THOSE JOBS GOING TO GO OVERSEAS? ( LAUGHTER )  I HAVE TO DRIVE MY CAR ALL THE  WAY ACROSS THE PACIFIC INTO GENG  GONG, TO GET A BURGER FROM A CHINESE GUY.
A VERY LONG LUNCH BREAK.
Stephen:  YOU'VE HEARD FAST  FOOD CALLED A GUILTY PLEASURE,  RIGHT, OKAY? PART OF THE GUILTY I FEEL IS  THAT I KNOW THEY'RE BEING  TREATED SO POORLY. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU KNOW, AND IF THAT GETS TAKEN  AWAY FROM ME, THE FOOD WILL LOSE  SOME OF ITS FLAVOR. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I WON'T FEEL AS NAUGHTY WHEN I  BUY IT IF I KNOW THEY'RE NOT  BEING OPPRESSED BY A  CORPORATION. ( LAUGHTER )  SAME REASON I LIKE VEAL. I CAN TASTE THE SADNESS.   ( APPLAUSE )   YOU KNOW?
YEAH, I KNOW.
Stephen:  YOU'RE WILLING TO  GIVE THAT JIEWP YES, I'M WILLING  TO GIVE THAT UP BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK HARD, GET  BY AND GET AHEAD. AND THAT'S THE PROMISE WE MADE  TO EVERY WORKENER THIS COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARD AND  BARELY GETTING BY, AND IT'S  WRONG. AND THESE WORKERS ARE STANDING  UP FOR ALL OF US, AND THEY'RE  GOING TO MAKE THESE LOW-WAGE JOBS GOOD JOBS, JUST LIKE AUTO  JOBS BECAME GOOD JOBS, SERVICE  JOBS CAN BECOME GOOD JOBS. AND THANK GOD FOR THE FAST FOOD  WORKERS FOR STANDING UP AND  MAKING THAT HAPPEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU FOR  JOINING ME. THE PRESIDENT OF THE SERVICE
