Stephen:  WELCOME BACK  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR WITH A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE VIRTUES OF KINDNESS. WHICH MEANS I GET TO YELL AT HIM AND HE'S JUST GOING TO SIT THERE. PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE SAUNDERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HEY, GEORGE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen:  FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW YOU'RE A McCARTHUR GRANT RECEIVEEE AND A BESTSELLING AUTHOR. AND A NEW ONE IS CALLED-- CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY, IT'S SOME THOUGHTS ON KINDNESS. THIS STARTED OFF AS A SPEECH YOU GAVE AT SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, A COMMENCEMENT?
YES.
Stephen:  SO SELL ME ON KINDNESS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT GETS GREAT PRESS. IT GETS GREAT PRESS, OKAY. DON'T GET ME WRONG, GOT A GREAT PUBLICIST. WHAT'S IN KINDNESS FOR ME? ( LAUGHTER ).
WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE SPEECH, I WAS KIND OF BLANKED OUT. I THOUGHT YOU HAVE A ROOM FULL OF YOUNG KIDS THAT ARE IMPATIENT. WHAT CAN I SAY THAT'S REALLY URGENT? I LOOKED BACK AND SAID IN ALL MY LIFE WHAT DO I REGRET? AND THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH ACTUALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, LIKE THE LITTLE HUMILIATIONS-- YOU CAN FORGO ALL THAT. BUT THERE WERE A HAND FULL OF THINGS THEY REALLY REGRETTED AND THEY ALL HAD TO DO WITH MOMENTS WHERE SOMEBODY NEEDED ME TO BE KIND TO THEM OR STEP UP AND I DIDN'T FOR WHATEVER REASON. SO I WROTE ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR GIRL IN OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASS WHO WAS KIND OF AN OUTCAST.
AND TRIED TWO OR THREE TIMES TO HELP HER AND THEN I KIND OF CHICKENED OUT. I HAD THAT  FEELING WHEN SOMEBODY IS DROWNING AND YOU GO TO HELP AND YOU GO THIS COULD GET UGLY. AND I KIND OF BAILED ON HER.
Stephen:  I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY DONE THAT TO SOMEONE. ( LAUGHTER ).
I RECOMMEND IT. NO, NO, NO. BUT-- SO SHE WAS KIND OF A NICE GIRL, AND AT THAT TIME I WAS A PRETTY STRONG CATHOLIC, AND I IDENTIFIED CLOSELY WITH THAT KIND OF 70s IDEA OF JESUS AS BEING SO COMPASSIONATE THAT HE WAS COMFORTABLE ANYWHERE. AND I THOUGHT, YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.
Stephen:  DID YOU HELP HER EVER?
WELL, I TRIED. I SORT OF MADE A FEW ATTEMPTS, BUT YOU COULD SEE THIS HAD PROBABLY HAPPENED TO HER BEFORE IN OTHER SCHOOLS, AND SHE WAS A LITTLE LEERY AND REALLY WASN'T THAT EAGER TO BE HELPED. SO AT THAT POINT, AT SOME POINT I JUST SAID, YEAH, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. AND I COULD SORT OF FEEL MYSELF  FALLING AWAY FROM THAT IDEA OF JESUS I HAD IN MY MIND WHICH I THINK IS WHY I REMEMBERED IT ALL THESE YEARS LATER.
Stephen:  SO YOU REGRET THAT VERY MUCH. HOW DID MIDDLE SCHOOL GO FOR YOU.
PRETTY GOOD.
Stephen:  SO ( BLEEP ) HER. NO, NO, LISTEN, BUT IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. IT'S A JUNGLE. IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED. I MEAN, HERE'S MY-- HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH YOUR-- WITH KINDNESS, GEORGE. IF EVERYONE TRIES TO BE KIND, OKAY-- LET'S SAY WE ALL TRY TO BE KIND, AND ONE GUY STAYS A DICK, OKAY, WE'RE ALL SUCKERS. AND HE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF US. OKAY? I FOR ONE DON'T WANT TO GET TO ST. PETER AT THE PEARLY GATE AND SAY, "OH, YEAH, YOU WERE KIND TO PEOPLE BUT YOU WERE A SUCKER AND SOMEBODY ABUSED FOOD STAMPS. GO TO HELL."
YOU MAKE A GOOD CASE.
Stephen:  THANK YOU.
I WAS COMING HERE TO PROMOTE THE KINDNESS BOOK AND I WAS ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE AND I GET TO THE TOLLBOOTH AND I GET INTO THAT LITTLE THING, THAT LITTLE KIND OF-- AND THE GUY COMES OUT AND DROPS A CONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY CAR.
Stephen:  A COMB?
A CONE. AND HE SAID, "YOU GOTTA GO BACK." SO I LOOKED BACK AND IT'S FREEZING RAIN. IT'S NIGHT. THE CARS ARE, LIKE, SIX OR SEVEN CARS ARE BEHIND ME. SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, INVOKE KINDNESS. SO I JUMP OUT OF THE CAR AND I GO UP TO HIM AND SAY IN MY BEST NEW AGE VOICE, "SIR, I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE BEST DECISION GIVEN THE CONDITIONS." AND HE GOES, "I DON'T GIVE A CRAP. I'M GOING HOME." SO I THOUGHT THIS IS A-- YOU KNOW, A REALLY GOOD KINDNESS CASE. I SAID, "IF YOU DON'T MIND, I THINK IT'S NOT EVEN IN YOUR INTEREST." HE SAID, "I'M GOING HOME." AND HE WALKED OFF. SO THAT'S A CASE WHERE I-- WHAT I WANTED TO DO --
Stephen:  HE DROPPED THE CONE IN FRONT OF YOU IT WASN'T GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, WAS IT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
NO, I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIM.
Stephen:  SO BEING NICE IS NOT KIND.
IN THAT MOMENT I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING REALLY CUTTING TO HIM.
Stephen:  WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID?
I CAN'T THINK OF IT BECAUSE I'M SO KIND. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU.
Stephen:  TEACH AT SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY.
Stephen:  I DO. DO YOU HAVE TENURE?
I DO.
Stephen:  WHY ARE YOU KIND STILL? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE KIND ANYMORE? YOU COULD BE A COMPLETE MONSTER AND NO ONE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO YOU.
I HAVE THE SWEETEST STUDENTS EVER-- WHY NOT BE NICE?
Stephen:  YOU SAY BECOMING KINDER HAPPENS NATURALLY WITH AGE. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN GRUMPY OLD MEN?
YEAH, I-- ( LAUGHTER ) I GOT A FEW E-MAILS-- "YOU SHOULD MEET MY FATHER-IN-LAW. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT." FOR ME I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU GET OLDER, YOU HAVE LESS ENERGY. SO IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO MAINTAIN YOUR NEUROSES AND HATRED. I THINK AS YOU GET OLDER YOU'RE LIKE I WISH I COULD STILL BE HATEFUL, BUT I'M TOO TIRED. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU HAVE KIDS. AND YOU SEE THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS ON PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU-- I THINK ACTUALLY THE DUST KIND OF SETTLES. IN MY EXPERIENCE YOU SORT OF SEE THAT LEARNING TO BECOME MORE SYMPATHETIC AND LOVING ACTUALLY IS REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. ALL THE OTHER STUFF OF KIND OF JUST DUST, YOU KNOW?
Stephen:  THE CENTRAL MESSAGE TO STUDENTS IS STRIVE FOR KINDNESS.
YES.
Stephen:  IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S MORE REALISTIC FOR GRADUATING SENIORS RIGHT NOW THAN STRIVING FOR JOBNESS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).   ( CHEERS )
IT GIVES THEM SOMETHING TO DO WHILE WAITING FOR THEIR REJECTION LETTER.
Stephen:  OR WAITING TABLES. WHEN HAS KINDNESS WORKED FOR YOU?
FOR ME.
Stephen:  WHEN DID IT PAY OFF? IT DIDN'T PAY OFF FOR THE GUY WITH THE CONES.
NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen:  THE GIRL IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE THINGS I LEFT OUT OF THE SPEECH. THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRADUATION BUZZ-KILL. DON'T KILL A GUY.
Stephen:  DID YOU KILL SOMEONE?
NO.
Stephen:  OKAY, BUT THAT'S OUT THERE NOW. WHEN HAS KINDNESS WORKED FOR YOU, GEORGE?
IT WORKED WHEN I WAS THE RECIPIENT OF IT.
Stephen:  OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) GIMME, GIMME, GIMME. THE MESSAGE IS BE KIND BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU CAN THINK OF ONE TIME YOU WERE A NICE GUY, PLEASE COME BACK. GEORGE SAUNDERS. IT'S A GREAT BOOK. IT'S A WONDERFUL SPEECH. IT'S CALLED "CONGRATULATIONS." BUY IT FOR EVERY GRADUATE. THEY'LL LOVE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
