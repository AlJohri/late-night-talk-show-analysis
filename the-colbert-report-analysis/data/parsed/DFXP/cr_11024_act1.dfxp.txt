(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I AM ALWAYS -- YOU KNOW ME. YOU WATCH THIS SHOW. I'M NOT PROUD. I'M NOT PROUD. ( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!" )
Stephen: OH, I CAN'T FIGHT THAT. BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, I'M NOT A PRIDEFUL MAN. I ALWAYS AM THE FIRST TO ADMIT WHEN I'M WRONG, AND ONCE AGAIN, I AM RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THIS TIME IT'S ABOUT OBAMACARE. FOLKS, I'VE NEVER LIKED IT. FIRST, THEY PUT A BUREAUCRAT BETWEEN AND YOU YOUR DOCTOR, AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR AND THE BUREAUCRAT ARE HANGING OUT ALL THE TIME AND CONVENIENTLY FORGET TO CALL  YOU THE NIGHT THEY WANT TO GO SEE "INTERSTELLAR," AND YOU  HEARD THEY HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME, THEY EVEN HAD A BEER  AFTERWARDS TO TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE. THANKS, OBAMA. ( LAUGHTER ) LUCKILY, THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN POWER NOW, AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BY UNDOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
REPUBLICANS DOMINATE STATE GOVERNMENTS THIS TIME AROUND, ALSO EAGER TO FIX OBAMACARE.
THERE ARE SOME CHANGES TO OBAMACARE THAT I THINK BOTH PARTIES CAN AGREE TO.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE IDEAS, THAT WE ARE GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION AND TRY TO FIX OBAMACARE.
Stephen: YES, AFTER MORE THAN 50 VOTES AGAINST OBAMACARE, THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS NOW PROMISING TO FIX THE LAW. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU TRY TO MURDER SOMEONE 50 TIMES, AND IT DOESN'T WORK, SO YOU BUY THEM A GYM MEMBERSHIP. AND THEY HAVE A GREAT STARTING POINT FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM-REFORM.
WE'LL TAKE ON OBAMACARE REGULATIONS THAT THREATEN THE 40-HOUR WORK WEEK.
LET'S PUT ON HIS DESK THINGS LIKE RESTORE THE 40-HOUR WORK WEEK.
THE LOSS OF 40-HOUR WORK WEEK, BIG, BIG, MISTAKE. THAT OUGHT TO BE RESTORED.
WE MUST TAKE ACTION AND RESTORE THE TRADITIONAL 40-HOUR WORK WEEK.
Stephen: YES, RESTORE THE TRADITIONAL FOUR-HOUR WORK WEEK AS GOD INTENDED WHEN HE CLOCKED OUT AT FIVE WHETHER OR NOT THE OCEANS WERE DONE. THAT'S WHY FLOUNDERS LOOK SO WEIRD. CONGRESS MIGHT NOT HAVE TO FIX THIS WRECK BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE WRECKED ITSELF.
OPPONENTS OF OBAMACARE HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO."
THE INCENDIARY REMARKS BY ONE OF OBAMACARE'S CHIEF ARCHITECTS, M.I.T. ECONOMICS PROFESSOR JONATHAN GRUBER.
IF YOU MADE IT EXPLICIT THAT HEALTHY PEOPLE PAY IN AND  SICK PEOPLE GET MONEY IT WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED.
HE CLAIMS OBAMACARE WAS INTENTIONALLY WRITTEN IN A TORTURED WAY TO HIDE THE TAXES THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED THE BILL.
Stephen: A-HA! I KNEW IT. OBAMACARE IS FUNDED BY TAXES, UNLIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE F-35 FIGHTER JET PROGRAM IS PAID FOR WITH CANDY SALES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND JUST LISTEN TO WHY THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH THIS.
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS A HUGE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, AND BASICALLY, CALL IT THE STUPIDITY OF THE AMERICAN VOTER OR WHATEVER, BUT BASICALLY, THAT WAS REALLY, READY CRITICAL TO GET THE THING TO PASS.
Stephen: THE STUPIDITY OF THE AMERICAN VOTER. PROFESSOR GRUBER JUST DELIVERED A DEATH BLOW TO OBAMACARE IN WHAT I'M CALLING THE "ZA-GRUBER FILM." AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE WHO IS OFFENDED. JUST ASK SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN AND GUY WHO PUT HIS WIG ON BACKWARDS . ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TREY GOWDY.
I WOULD SAY THIS TO THE-- TO THE PROFESSOR. PUT DOWN THE COGNAC, AND THE LOST WRITINGS OF J.D. SALINGER. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW STUPID OUR FELLOW CITIZENS ARE, TAKE A LOOK AT LAST TUESDAY NIGHT.
Stephen: YES, IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW STUPID AMERICANS ARE, JUST LOOK AT WHO THEY ELECTED LAST TUESDAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN YOUR FACE. THESE ARE SMART GUYS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WASTING TIME ON SALINGER'S LOST STORIES? THE ONLY GOOD ONE IS "A GIRL I KNEW." IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT THROUGH "HAPWORTH 16" YOU'RE GOING TO NEED SOMETHING STRONGER THAN COGNAC. OF COURSE, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU, DEMOCRATS ARE. MANIPULATIVE ELITISTS. FOX WILL DO IT FOR ME.
THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF GETTING THIS PASSED WAS ALL PREDICATED ON MANIPULATING, LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED ANY OTHER WAY.
THEY NEW EXWOOU THIS KIND OF STUFF THE WHOLE TIME, THEY GIEW EXWOOU IT, AND THEY AGREED WITH GRUBER THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF THING YOU COULD TALK ABOUT PUBLICLY BECAUSE IT WOULD KILL THE BILL.
DO YOU THINK THEY GAVE A RAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY DON'T CARE. THEY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED.
Stephen: YES! CONTEMPTUOUS DEMOCRATS LOOKED DOWN ON  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THEIR IVORY TOWERS AND THOUGHT WHAT A PATHETIC HORDE OF DULLARDS. LET'S GIVE THEM HEALTH CARE. WHEREAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S SHAMEFUL. IT'S SHAMEFUL. FOR SHAME. WHEREAS, REPUBLICANS RESPECTED THE VOTERS' INTELLIGENCE BY TELLING THEM THE DEATH PANELS WOULD GRIND UP YOUR GRANDMA TO MAKE GLUE. AND PROFESSOR NUMB NUTS HERE WASN'T EVEN THE WORST THING TO HAPPEN TO OBAMACARE THIS WEEK, BECAUSE ON FRIDAY THE SUPREME COURT AGREED TO HEAR YET ANOTHER LEGAL CHALLENGE THAT COULD KILL THE LAW. IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING-- THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE GRIND SLOWLY, BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'LL RUN OVER SICK PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THE LAST TWO TIMES I DECLARED OBAMACARE DEAD, I DROPPED BALLOONS, AND TWERKED ON THE GRIM REAPER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BUT, FOLKS, LOOKING BACK-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOKING BACK, I THINK THAT WAS A LITTLE IMMATURE. SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GONNA SLOW DANCE. JIMMY?  ♪  ♪ ♪ I JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND I'M WITH YOU. ♪ AND ALL THAT I SO WANT TO GIVE YOU. ♪ IS ONLY A HEARTBEAT AWAY ♪
YOU CANNOT-- YOU CANNOT BLAME GUY FOR TRYING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! I LOVE-- I LOVE WATCHING YOU WALK AWAY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, FOLKS, OF COURSE, THERE IS A VERY GOOD REASON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE MAY LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. CLUMSY SEMANTICS. YOU SEE, IN THE CASE "KING V. BURWELL"   THE PLAINTIFFS ARGUE THAT SINCE THE EXACT WORDS OF THE LAW SAY SUBSIDIES ARE INTENDED FOR THOSE WHO ARE "ENROLLED IN THROUGH AN EXCHANGE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE, SUBSIDIES CANNOT BE AVAILABLE ON THE healthcare.gov EXCHANGE." SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A FEW SLOPPY, ILL-CONSIDERED WORDS, AND FOR ONCE, THEY'RE NOT JOE BIDEN'S. SO BOTTOM LINE, THIS LAW IS DEAD, AND I WILL BROOK NO DISSENT ON THE ISSUE. HERE TO FORD MY BROOK IS THE "COLBERT REPORT" SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST AND PERSON ACTUALLY EMPLOYED BY THE "NEW YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE, EMILY BAZELON. EMILY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ALL RIGHT, EMILY, IS THIS A DEATH KNELL FOR OBAMACARE?
NO, IT SHOULD NOT BE BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS WHEN YOU READ THE 900-PAGE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS A WHOLE, THE WORDS YOU SINGLED OUT NEED TO BE READ IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALLOW SUBSIDIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ENROLL IN THE FEDERALLY CREATED EXCHANGES.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT I DIDN'T SINGLE IT OUT. THE CASE SINGLED IT OUT. THE SUPREME COURT IS HEARING THE CASE. THEY MUST THINK THEY'RE PRETTY IMPORTANT WORDS. THE WORDS SAY, "THROUGH A STATE," OK? A STATE IS NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, RIGHT?
A STATE IS NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
Stephen: OKAY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. DID I JUST WIN? DID I JUST WIN?
NO, YOU DIDN'T WIN, BECAUSE THE IRS IS THE AGENCY WHO HAS THE POWER TO INTERPRET THE LAW UPON. I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR FAVORITE AGENCY --
Stephen:  IT'S NO ONE'S FAVORITE AGENCY.
IT'S STILL THE I.R.S.' JOB, AND THE I.R.S. SAYS WE'RE READING THIS LAW AS A WHOLE COHERENTLY. IN CONTEXT, IT IS CLEAR THAT STATE EXCHANGES SET UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-- THEY'RE STILL STATE EXCHANGES-- CAN STILL GIVE PEOPLE THESE SUBSIDIES. COURTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DEFER TO AGENCIES, THE I.R.S.' READING OF THE LAW, NOT MAKE IT UP THEMSELVES.
Stephen: SO LET'S JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT THE WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD YOU'RE DOING WILL NOT WORK.
OKAY.
Stephen: AND THEY RULE IN FAVOR OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU CAN'T GET MONEY THROUGH THE FEDERAL EXCHANGES. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LAW THEN?
THE LAW COULD GO INTO A DEATH SPIRAL, AS YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE, BECAUSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SIGNED UP THROUGH FEDERALLY RUN EXCHANGES ARE RECEIVING SUBSIDIES. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE, WANT HEALTH INSURANCE, PRESUMABLY, BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT ON THEIR OWN. SO THE SUPREME COURT WOULD BE STRIPPING FROM THEM ALL THE MONEY ALLOWING THESE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO HAVE HEALTH CARE, EFFECTIVELY TAKING HEALTH CARE FROM MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: BUT DOESN'T THAT REFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE? BECAUSE LAST TUESDAY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE VOTED, AND THEY SAID WITH A SINGLE VOICE, NO HEALTH CARE, THANKS. ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, NO, NO, BECAUSE CONGRESS DID PASS OBAMACARE. IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER NOW, BUT CONGRESS --
Stephen:  I DON'T, ACTUALLY. I DON'T, ACTUALLY.
CONGRESS PASSED OBAMACARE. AND WHILE THE PAST CONGRESS TRIED --
Stephen: BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT. IF ONLY THOSE PEOPLE WERE STILL ALIVE TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY MEANT.
BUT WE DO HAVE THOSE PEOPLE AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAVE SAID THEY INTENDED TO RESTRICT SUBSIDIES TO STATE-RUN EXCHANGES. THEY ALL SAY NO. EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO GET THESE SUBSIDIES. EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO VOTED FOR THAT LAW.
Stephen: WILL THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING ON THIS?
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER CONGRESSIONAL INTENT, THIS IDEA OF LOOKING AT WHAT LEGISLATORS WERE TRYING TO DO, HAS ANY WEIGHT WITH THE JUSTICES.
Stephen: SOTOMAYOR AND KAGAN AND BREYER, ALL THOSE GUYS, THEY-- ALL THE LIBERAL JUSTICES, I HAPPEN TO KNOW  THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, THEY HAVE BEEN SICK,  SO SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO RECUSE THEMSELVES?
YOU THINK THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE BEEN SICK?
Stephen: SCALIA HAS NEVER BEEN SICK A DAY IN HIS LIFE. NO, YOU EAT THAT MUCH PROSCIUTTO, NOTHING CAN LIVE INSIDE OF YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO WHAT HAPPENS? SO IF THEY RULE AGAINST THE OBAMACARE THING OBAMACARE THING, IF THE FEDERAL EXCHANGES AREN'T ABLE TO GIVE ANY MONEY, IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN DO AFTER THAT? CAN THE SUPPORTERS OF OBAMACARE APPEAL TO THE JUSTICE LEAGUE OR THE LEGION OF DOOM OR THE AVENGERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
THEY COULD APPEAL TO CONGRESS. CONGRESS COULD FIX THIS VERY EASILY. BUT DO YOU THINK CONGRESS IS REALLY GOING TO DO THAT?
Stephen: NO. EMILY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. EMILY BAZELON, THE "NEW YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU.
