Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU SO MUCH! ALL RIGHT! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAVE A SEAT. NATION, IT'S MED-TERM SEASON AND, EARLIER THIS WEEK, I GAVE YOU COMPLETE COVERAGE OF ONE OF THE MOST EXPLOSIVE RACES -- THE CONTEST IN FLORIDA BETWEEN REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT AND DEMOCRATIC FORMER GOVERNOR CHARLIE CRIST. LAST NIGHT, THE TWO WERE SCHEDULED TO FACE OFF IN A DEBATE. IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES TO SHOW VOTERS WHO IS MORE NATORIAL-GUBER-Y. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS BEING FLORIDA, RIGHT OFF THE BEAN, THINGS GOT VERY FLORIDA. (LAUGHTER)
WE WANT TO TAKE A SHOT OF THE STAGE HERE AT BAILEY HALL IN BROWARD COUNTY, AND AS YOU CAN SEE, THE TWO CANDIDATES, WHO WERE INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS DEBATE, RIGHT NOW ARE NOT STEPPING UP ON THE STAGE. (LAUGHTER) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE AN EXTREMELY PECULIAR SITUATION RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE GOVERNOR CHARLIE CRIST (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT, OUR INCUMBENT GOVERNOR, AND THE REPUBLICAN COUNTY FOR GOVERNOR IS ALSO IN THE BUILDING, GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT GOVERNOR SCOTT WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS DEBATE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, ONLY CHARLIE CRIST WAS ON STAGE! GIVING C-SPAN ITS MOST DRAMATIC TELEVISION MOMENT SINCE THE CANCELLATION OF BOOKNOTES DEATHMATCH. FOLKS, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY GUY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND PYTHON ON ECSTASY, RICK SCOTT. (LAUGHTER) BUT HE HAD AN EXCELLENT REASON FOR NOT BEING THERE.
GOVERNOR CRIST HAS ASKED TO HAVE A FAN, A SMALL FAN PLACED UNDERNEATH HIS PODIUM. THE RULES OF THE DEBATE THAT I WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTT CAMPAIGN SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FAN. SOMEHOW THERE IS A FAN THERE.
GOVERNOR CRIST, DO THE RULES OF THE DEBATE SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FAN?
ARE WE REALLY GOING TO DEBATE ABOUT A FAN, OR ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EDUCATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE?
Stephen: FAN! FAN! FAN! WHO TWO (BLEEP) ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT OR EDUCATION? IT'S FLORIDA. EVERYONE NEEDS A FAN! AND I'M NOT ALONE IN BEING A FAN FAN BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH SCOTT CAME OUT THREE MINUTE LATER AND THEY HELD A HEATED HOUR-LONG DEBATE ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS, ALL ANYONE IS TALKING ABOUT FOOD IS FANGATE! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, CLEARLY FOR SCOTT'S CAMPAIGN, LAST NIGHT BLEW. AND IF YOU TURN THE SWITCH THE OTHER WAY, IT SUCKED. (CHEERING) BIG FANS OF SUCKING HERE TONIGHT. (CHEERING) BUT THE WHOLE THING WAS UNFAIR. NOW I DON'T BLAME CRIST FOR WANTING TO BRING HIS OWN COOLANT. BASED ON THAT SKIN TONE, I'D SAY HIS CORE TEMPERATURE'S AROUND 450 DEGREES. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHY SHOULD CRIST GET TO COOL HIMSELF WITH A FAN, BUT SCOTT ISN'T ALLOWED TO CONTROL HIS TEMPERATURE BY LAYING ON A CHILLED ROCK? (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, BOTH SIDES ARE STILL OSCILLATING OVER WHETHER THE FAN WAS A VIOLATION. SCOTT'S CAMPAIGN SIGNED A RULES DOCUMENT STATING THAT "CANDIDATES MAY NOT BRING ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING FANS." BUT CRIST'S CAMPAIGN ADDED, "WITH UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEBATE HOSTS WILL ADDRESS ANY TEMPERATURE ISSUES WITH A FAN IF NECESSARY," ALL OF WHICH IS JUST SPLITTING HAIRS. WHICH IS ALSO UNFAIR TO RICK SCOTT. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE FAN WASN'T RICK SCOTT'S ONLY OBJECTION LAST NIGHT. HE HAD AN EVEN BETTER REASON FOR NOT TAKING THE STAGE.
GOVERNOR SCOTT, WHY THE DELAY IN COMING OUT OVER A FAN?
I WAITED TO BE -- UNTIL WE FIGURED OUT IF HE WAS GONNA SHOW UP. HE SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO COME TO THE -- UH -- HE WAS -- HE SAID HE WASN'T GONNA COME TO THE DEBATE. SO WHY COME OUT UNTIL HE'S READY?
Stephen: RIGHT, HE WAS JUST WAITING IN THE WINGS FOR SEVEN MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THE GUY ON STAGE WAS GONNA COME TO THE DEBATE. (LAUGHTER) BOTTOM LINE, AS MUCH AS I WISH IT WASN'T TRUE, LAST NIGHT IN MIAMI, RICK SCOTT WAS... BLOWN AWAY. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOO! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
