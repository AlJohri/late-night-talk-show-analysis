Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY, MY GUEST IS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE WHO JUST RELEASED HSI 15TH BOOK. LOOKS LIKE HILLARY'S GOT SOME COMPETITION. PLEASE WELCOME DR. HENRY KISSINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HENRY. GOT TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR COMING BACK. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE LAST SUMMER WHEN WE WERE BUSTING A MOVE TO GET LUCKY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THAT LAST YEAR.
WELL, THE LAST TIME DID YOU THIS, MY OFFICE I HAD A TELEPHONE ON MY DESK Stephen: AND YOU CALLED SECUIRTY
COULD CALL FOR SECURITY.
Stephen: EXACTLY. I GOT MY SECURITY HERE TONIGHT. YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. OKAY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE, WINNER OF THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZING HELPED BRING AN END TO THE VIETNAM WAR, FORGED THE RAYPOSCHMA WITH CHINA- - I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT RAYPROSHMA MEANS.  YOU LEAD THE POLICY OF DETANTE WITH THE SOVIET UNION. THIS IS YOUR 15th BOOK. IT'S CALLED WORLD ORDER, OKAY. I ASSUME BY THAT TITLE THIS IS FICTION, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ORDER IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW, HENRY. HOW-- WHAT-- OBAMA HASN'T GIVEN HIS, YOU KNOW, SPEECH YET, OKAY. WE'RE RECORDING THIS EARLIER. SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OBAMA'S SPEECH YET. BUT YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT IT'S TERRIBLE, RIGHT? TERRIBLE SPEECH, COMPLETE FAILURE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING IT TO SAY?
I THINK HE'S GOING TO SAY THAT HE WILL ATTACK THESE TERRORIST GROUPS IN BOTH IRAQ AND SYRIA.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND I AGREE WITH THAT.
Stephen: YOU DO.
YES.
Stephen: ANYPLACE ELSE WE SHOULD BE BOMBING? CAN YOU, CAN YOU BOMB ORDER BACK INTO THE WORLD? CAN WE JUST BOMB EVERYBODY BACK TO THE STONE AGE AND THEN INVITE THEM BACK INTO THE 16th CENTURY?
NO YOU CAN'T BOMB THEM BACK INTO THE WORLD. BUT YOU CAN TRY TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO DISTURB ORDER TO CONTINUE DISTURBING IT.
Stephen: WHY IS THE WORLD THE WAY IT IS NOW, OKAY? IS THIS CRAZIER THAN IT USED TO BE? OR ARE WE JUST NOTICING HOW CRAZY IT IS?
WELL, FOR ONE THING, EVERY PART OF THE WORLD CAN NOW IMPACT EVERY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TWITTER AND STUFF LIKE THAT, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS.
Stephen: YEAH.
AND I WILL DISGRACE MYSELF, BUT I DON'T USE TWITTER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY? WELL,-- WE'LL CHANGE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TWEET FOR YOU. I'LL TWEET FOR YOU TONIGHT, WE'LL COME UP WITH A GOOD ONE, ALL RIGHT.
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SO BUT WHY, THE WORLD CRAZIER NOW THAN IT USED TO BE REALLY OR ARE WE JUST NOTICING IT.
IF YOU TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE MIDDLE EAST.
Stephen: NO THANK YOU, BUT GO AHEAD. (LAUGHTER)
WHAT YOU HAVE THERE IS A WHOLE SERIES OF REVOLUTIONS, OF A DIFFERENT KIND, OCCURRING SIDE-BY-SIDE. PRESSURES ON THE STATE, THE DISAPPEARANCES OF FRONTIERS,  THE BATTLE BETWEEN VARIOUS RELIGIOUS GROUPS. AND THIS IS ALL COMING TO THE SURFACE SIMULTANEOUSLY.
Stephen: IT'S OBAMA FAULT'S HOW, HOW IS THIS OBAMA'S FAULT?
IT'S NOT OBAMA'S FAULT.
Stephen: HENRY, I'M GOING TO EDIT THAT OUT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S FAIR WARNING, I'M TAKING THAT OUT. I'M TAKING THAT OUT. I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IN THE WORD'S "OBAMA'S FAULT" (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE UKRAINE HERE. IS THERE A REESTABLISHMENT OF AN OLD WORLD ORDER GOING ON. BECAUSE PUTIN IS REASSERTING THE KIND OF AUTHORITY THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAD OVER THAT PART, OVER THE WORLD. ARE WE IN TROUBLE THERE?
WELL, YOU CAN'T SAY WE ARE IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: ARE THE EUROPEANS IN TROUBLE?
WHAT IS HAPPENING IT IN THE UKRAINE IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT IDEAS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER. THE WEST BELIEVE IN SOVEREIGNTY OF STATES -- Stephen: WE IN THE WEST BELIEVE IN THE SOVEREIGNTY OF EVERY STATE, THESE ARE OUR BORDERS, DON'T COME OVER HERE.
CORRECT. AND YOU SHOULDN'T INTERFERE IN THEIR AFFAIRS. FOR THE RUSSIANS, UKRAINE IS WHAT THEY CONSIDER PART OF THEIR TERRITORY. BUT OF COURSE, YOU CANNOT HAVE A PEACEFUL WORLD IF THE PRINCIPLES IS ESTABLISHED THAT ANY COUNTRY CAN CROSS BORDERS BECAUSE IT THINKS IT HAS A HISTORIC PATRIMONY. BUT IT IS NOT A PURELY AMERICAN PROBLEM.
Stephen: IS THERE GOING TO BE A WORLD PROBLEM? COULD THIS THING SPIRAL INTO WORLD WAR III?
WELL, WHAT I BELIEVE IS, IS --
Stephen: HENRY, A COMFORTING ANSWER WOULD BE NO --  (LAUGHTER) IT WOULD BE VERY NICE HEAR YOU SAY NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT WORLD WAR III, BUT NO GO ON TO YOUR ACTUAL ANSWER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW AS A GRANDPA FIGURE YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST SAY NO, SLEEP TIGHT. GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
NO, NO, THAT IS WHAT I WOULD SAY, NO. BUT I WOULD SAY-- BUT TO ATTEMPT TO TRANSFORM UKRAINE INTO A BRIDGE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE WEST RATHER THAN AS AN OUTPOST OF EITHER, AGAINST THE OTHER.
Stephen: WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR? IS IT FOR WORLD LEADERS AS A MANUAL TO REESTABLISH ORDER?
NO, IT'S WRITTEN FOR, I HOPE, ORDINARY AMERICANS IF THEY TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: SO IF YOU AT HOME ARE SAYING TO YOURSELF WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, THIS IS YOUR BOOK? HENRY KISSINGER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BOOK IS WORLD ORDER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
