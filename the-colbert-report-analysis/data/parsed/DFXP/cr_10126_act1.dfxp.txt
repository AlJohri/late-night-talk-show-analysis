Stephen: WHOO. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
Stephen: U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NATION, NATION, YOU CAN FEEL IT AT HOME. IT'S LIKE A WAVE OF ELECTRIC PATRIOTISM RIGHT ACROSS THE WIRE AT YOU BECAUSE WE'RE ALL EXCITED AND CHEERING FOR THE SAME REASON -- I'M ABOUT TO TAKE A TWO-WEEK VACATION. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT ALSO I AM PUMPED ABOUT TEAM U.S.A.'S MATCH AGAINST GERMANY TODAY. THEY SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE, BUT WE DUG DOWN DEEP AND LOST OUR GAME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT, BUT, BUT WE ALSO HAD PORTUGAL WIN IN A DIFFERENT GAME BY NOT BY A LOT, SO WE'RE NUMBER TWO, WE'RE NUMBER TWO, WE'RE NUMBER TWO!
AUDIENCE: WE'RE NUMBER TWO, WE'RE NUMBER TWO!
Stephen: AND FOLKS, I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ROUND. LIKE YOU, I'VE BEEN BITTEN HARD BY THE SOCCER BUG, ALSO KNOWN AS LUIS SUAREZ. I'M NOT ALONE, FOLKS. A RECORD 25 MILLION AMERICANS WATCHED SUNDAY'S GAME AGAINST PORTUGAL, WHICH IS WHAT HAS ME SO WORRIED.
AMERICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE WORLD CUP. WHAT'S WRONG HERE? WELL, IF YOU WANT EXPERTS ON WRONGNESS, YOU WANT FOX BUSINESS.
WHY, STUART, ARE WE SEEING SOCCER SUDDENLY SKYROCKET? WHY ARE PEOPLE SO READY TO BE ENTERTAINED?
I'LL TELL YOU WHY THIS HAS HAPPENED. IT'S BECAUSE THE NEWS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY, OUR ECONOMY AND OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD IS OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVE. IT IS AWFUL. WE'RE APPROACHING A RECESSION, WE'VE LOST IRAQ. WE'RE DOWNGRADED THE WORLD OVER. WE DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THAT.  WE WANT TO ESCAPE. SO HERE'S THE WORLD CUP. HOW CONVENIENT.
Stephen: YES, HOW CONVENIENT. STU AND ANGRY ZIGGY SMELL SOMETHING FISHY, WHICH IS WHY IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S "BAT [BLEEPED] SERIOUS." NOW, FOLKS, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING, STEPHEN, DIDN'T YOU JUST DO YOUR "BAT [BLEEPED] SERIOUS" SEGMENT LAST NIGHT TO UNCOVER THE SECRET FORCES BEHIND THE SURGE IN YOUNG IMMIGRANTS? MAYBE. BUT HERE'S A BETTER QUESTION: WHY CAN I HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS? [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE, NATION, I'M STARTING TO SUSPECT THE WORLD CUP MIGHT BE SOME SORT OF ORGANIZED GLOBAL SPORTING EVENT COORDINATED BY DOZENS OF FOREIGN NATIONS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GRAB AHOLD OF OUR ATTENTION, EVEN WORSE, THEY'RE GRABBING OUR ATTENTION WITH THEIR FEET. AND THERE'S MORE. DR. KEITH, ABLOW ME.
HERE'S THE WORLD CUP. HOW CONVENIENT. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON.
IT'S A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO I CONTEND HAS IT IN FOR AMERICANS AND WE ELECTED HIM BECAUSE WE WERE FEARFUL AT THE TIME. WE BETTER ELECT SOMEONE WHO IS NOT VERY PATRIOTIC, BECAUSE, GOD, WE COULD HAVE TERRORISTS ATTACK US FOR BEING AMERICANS. OKAY. SO WE DID THAT.
Stephen: OKAY. SO WE DID THAT. CHECK THAT BOX. OKAY. WHICH BRINGS US TO THE WORLD CUP. FOLLOW ME DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE, OR AS THEY SAY IN SOCCER, FOLLOW ME DOWN THE RABBIT GOOOOOOOOOOAL! HOW OFTEN DOES BARACK OBAMA RUN FOR PRESIDENT. EVERY FOUR YEARS. HOW OFTEN IS THERE A WORLD CUP? EVERY FOUR YEARS. NOW WATCH THIS. [LAUGHTER] THAT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN, FOLKS. BUT THERE'S A MORE SINISTER FORCE AT WORK HERE, AND AS USUAL, IT'S JAZZ CIGARETTES. JIM?
IT'S KIND OF STRANGE. THEY'RE ROLLING OUT THE MARIJUANA. THEY'RE GETTING EVERYBODY HIGH. AND THEY'RE GETTING EVERYBODY TO WATCH MORE AND MORE ENTERTAINMENT. DOES THAT SOUND LIKE PERHAPS, I DON'T WANT TO BE A CONSPIRACY THEORY GUY, BUT WHY IS THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A CONSPIRACY THEORY GUY, BUT DOES THAT SOUND LIKE PERHAPS BUT WHY IS THAT? AND MARIJUANA IS CLEARLY INVOLVED HERE, FOLKS, BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO BE BAKED OUT OF YOUR GOURD TO BE THAT PARANOID. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NATION, THE HIDDEN TRUTH OF GLOBAL MARIJUANA MIND CONTROL THAT DR. ABLOW HAS UNCOVERED IS A HUGE RELIEF, BECAUSE THE IDEA OF A VAST GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY TO DRUG ME INTO SEDATION WHILE I WATCH MINDLESS TELEVISION IS FAR LESS DISTURBING THAN THE ALTERNATIVE. THAT I ENJOY SOCCER. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN POINT OF VIEW. MINE JUST HAPPENS TO LOOK OVER THE GORGEOUS LANDSCAPE OF ME BEING RIGHT. THIS IS "TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FIRST UP, FOLKS, IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO START MAKING YOUR PLANS FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE. THAT'S WHY I RUN DRILLS TO STAY SHARP, EVERY NIGHT AT THE STROKE OF 12, I CHUG A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND THEN WEEP WHEN NO ONE KISSES ME. THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO CLAY COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA'S ANNUAL POSSUM DROP. FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH RICH SOUTHERN HERITAGE, HERE'S WHAT POSSUM DROP MEANS.
THEY ACTUALLY TAKE A LIVE POSSUM. THEY PUT IT IN A BOX. AND THEN THEY DROP IT. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen:  SORRY IF THAT GOT A BIT TECHNICAL, BUT YOU GET THE IDEA. WELL NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, THE FASCIST FUR-SCISTS AT PETA THINK THIS EVENT IS CRUEL TO POSSUM-KIND. I ASSUME BECAUSE IT KEEPS THEM FROM THEIR NATURAL POSSUM DESTINY OF BEING CRUSHED UNDER THE TIRE OF A KIA. WAY BACK IN 2012, A JUDGE IN NORTH CAROLINA RULED IT WAS ILLEGAL TO USE A LIVE OPOSSUM FOR SUCH AN EVENT. O-DICULOUS. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE PC POLICE WILL MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO HAVE THE LIVE POSSUM NATIVITY SCENE. LOSING THE POSSUM DROP WAS A BLOW TO AN ANCIENT TRADITION DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1990. THAT'S RIGHT, SINCE THE TIME OF THE DINOSAURS, WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE LEGISLATURE FOR SAVING THE CELEBRATION WITH A NEW BILL EXCLUDING OPOSSUMS FROM STATE WILDLIFE LAWS BETWEEN DECEMBER 26TH AND JANUARY 2nd IN CLAY COUNTY WHERE THE ANNUAL POSSUM DROP CELEBRATION IS HELD. SO NOW... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO TONIGHT WE'VE GOT SOME HUGE FANS OF PEOPLE WHO ENJOY WATCHING RODENTS AFFECTED BY GRAVITY. SO TO RECAP, TO RECAP, FOR ONE WEEK, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH A LIVE POSSUM IN A CAGE. YOU CAN RAISE IT, YOU CAN LOWER IT, YOU CAN MOVE IT SIDEWAYS. THE ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS ARE ENDLESS. DON'T WORRY. POSSUM-KILLING SEASON IS STILL ON YEAR ROUND. SO IF YOU WANT TO HUNT THEM FOR SPORT OR JUST CATCH ONE ROOTING THROUGH YOUR GARBAGE AND GAS IT IN A BUCKET USING YOUR CAR EXHAUST, YOU GO TO TOWN, SPECIFICALLY BRASSTOWN,  NORTH CAROLINA. NEXT UP, IF I KNOW TWO THINGS, IT'S THAT   CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND THAT BREAKFAST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY SO IT LOGICALLY FOLLOWS THAT CHILDREN'S  BREAKFASTS MUST BE THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE FUTURE. BUT A DISTURBING NEW REPORT IS UPENDING EVERYTHING WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT THIS COMPLETE BREAKFAST.
WE HAVE A NEW MEDICAL ALERT NOW WITH A WARNING FOR PARENTS THAT FORTIFIED CEREAL WE GIVE OUR KIDS TO GIVE THEM VITAMINS MAY BE DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE EATING CEREAL WITH POTENTIALLY  UNHEALTHY AMOUNTS OF VITAMIN A, ZINC AND NIACIN.
WE'RE OVERFORTIFYING OUR CEREALS.
Stephen: YOU MANIACS. YOU OVERFORTIFIED THEM. THE TRIX RABBIT TRIED TO WARN US. TRIX AREN'T FOR KIDS. AND, SONNY, YES, HE WAS COO-COO, BUT COO-COO FOR THE TRUTH THAT WE WEREN'T READY TO HEAR. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY... MY EPHEREAL-- IT'S BEGUN TO AFFECT MY SPEECH. A WAG OF THE FINGER TO CEREAL MANUFACTURERS. YOUR PRECIOUS VITAMIN-PACKING LEFT OUR CHILDREN VULNERABLE TO LIVER DAMAGE, RASHES AND IMMUNE PROBLEMS ALL BECAUSE WHEN KIDS'  CEREALS ARE FORTIFIED, NUTRIENTS ARE ADDED IN AMOUNTS CALCULATED  FOR ADULTS, WHICH ITSELF IS RIDICULOUS. ADULTS WOULD NEVER EAT THOSE CHILDISH FOODS FOR BREAKFAST. WE PREFER THE SOPHISTICATED TASTE OF POP-TARTS WILDLICIOUS. THEY'RE BAKED WITH REAL FRUIT ASTERISK. SO UNTIL OUR CEREAL CAN BE DENUTRITIONED TO SAFE FORTIFICATION LEVELS, PLEASE, PARENTS, FEED YOUR CHILDREN SOMETHING THAT'S JUST AS COLORFUL BUT BETTER FOR THEM, LIKE THE BOX. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
