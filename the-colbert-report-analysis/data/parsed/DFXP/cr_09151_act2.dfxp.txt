Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I'VE GOT TO TAKE MOMENT HERE AND WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THIS YET ON THE SHOW BUT I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND SPEAK ABOUT MONDAY'S TRAGIC SHOOTING IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. NAVAL YARD. OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE VICTIMS AND THE FAMILIES AND I'D LIKE TO SALUTE D.C.'S FIRST RESPONDERS WHO PREVENTED WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN EVEN BIGGER TRAGEDY. AND, FOLKS, AFTER WATCHING WALL-TO-WALL COVERAGE I HAVE TO SAY I'VE REASSESSED SOME OF MY LONG-HELD OPINIONS. WHILE WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED THE SHOOTER, WE KNOW HE HAD A TROUBLED AND VIOLENT PAST AND EVIDENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS. SO IT'S TIME TO ADMIT-- ALL OF US-- THAT SOME DANGEROUS ITEMS SHOULDN'T FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE DISTURBED.
HOW MANY TRAGEDIES SHOULD WE WITNESS BEFORE WE FINALLY ENACT COMMON SENSE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION?
Stephen: WHAT? NO, NOT GUNS! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS AFTER SANDY HOOK! GUNS? YOU'RE ADORABLE! (LAUGHTER) BUT FOR THE LAST TIME, GUNS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH GUN VIOLENCE! WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS! THIS IS A MILITARY I.D. CARD. THIS IS HOW YOU GET ON A MILITARY BASE. SO HOW DID HE GET ON? AGAIN, IN MY VIEW, HE HAD AN AUTHORIZED CARD.
MAYBE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE THESE CARDS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THINK ABOUT IT: HI HAD ACCESS TO A MILITARY I.D. CARD. IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT, WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT A TRAGEDY AT THE NAVY YARD, WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT A TRAGEDY IN A LESS-SECURE AREA LIKE A PARK OR A DENNY'S. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHAT'S THE ANSWER.
WE NEED TO START DOING MORE EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS ON CONTRACTORS.
WHY DID BACKGROUND CHECKS NOT OCCUR?
THERE ARE GAPS NOW IN SECURITY BACKGROUND CHECKS.
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH BACKGROUND CHECKS.
YES, HOW MANY TIMES DO CONSERVATIVES NEED TO SAY IT? WE NEED MORE BACKGROUND CHECKS! (LAUGHTER) OR AT LEAST A WAITING PERIOD FOR AN I.D. LIKE THEY HAVE AT THE D.M.V. (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE IT'S THREE DAYS. AT LEAST WE ALL KNOW WHAT DROVE THIS MADMAN TO GO OUT AND GET THAT I.D. CARD.
HE HAD AN OBSESSION WITH SHOOTING VIDEO GAMES.
SOMETIMES PLAYED VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES ALL NIGHT LONG.
HERE WE GO AGAIN. REPORT NATION VI YARD SHOOTER AARON ALEXIS LIKED TO PLAY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES.
THIS, INDEED, IS A STRONG LINK TO MASS KILLINGS THEN WHY AREN'T WE LOOKING AT FREQUENCY OF PURCHASES PER PERSON AND ALSO HOW OFTEN THEY'RE PLAYING?
YES, NEW GRETCHEN IS RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO MONITOR WHO IS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND HOW MUCH. MAYBE A NATIONAL GAME REGISTRY. I MEAN, I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS GUY NAMED:AAAH!" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE'S THE HIGH SCORER WHEREVER YOU LOOK! AND PLEASE DON'T TELL ME FROM'S BEEN NO PROVEN LINK BETWEEN VIDEO GAMES AND VIOLENCE! MADDEN 25 JUST CAME OUT AND SUDDENLY THERE'S A RASH OF FOOTBALL VIOLENCE ON T.V.! (LAUGHTER) BUT, OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE AGREES. TAKE FOX'S THE FIVE ERIC BOLLING.
WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN VIDEO GAMES? IT'S VIOLENT, YEAH, IT'S VIOLENT. BUT SO ARE MOVIES, SO IS TELEVISION. WHO'S THE JACKASS TO WHO STARTED POINTING FINGER AT VIDEO GAMES?
Stephen: GOOD QUESTION. WHO IS THE JACKASS WHO BLAMES GUN VIOLENCE ON VIDEO GAMES.
IT'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS. MENTAL HEALTH, GUNS, VIDEO GAMES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. TELEVISION IS VIOLENT. ERIC BOLLING JUST KICKED HIMSELF IN THE BALLS!
