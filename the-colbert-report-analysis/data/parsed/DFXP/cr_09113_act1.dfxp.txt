STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. SIT DOWN, NATION. NATION, I WANT YOU TO DO  SOMETHING FOR ME. FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO HUG YOUR  DOORS AND LOCK YOUR LOVED ONES  BECAUSE AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK BY KNOWLEDGE. WE NOW KNOW THAT THE N.S.A. IS  MIGHT BE SPYING ON US. AND WE WILL HAVE FULL ME  COVERAGE ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF  THAT TOMORROW. BUT TONIGHT WE FOCUS ON THE  LEAKER. BEHOLD THE FACE OF EVIL. HIS NAME IS EDWARD SNOWDEN, AND  HE'S AN EMPLOYEE OF DEFENSE  CONTRACTOR BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON NAMEDDED, OF COURSE, AFTER OUR  DRUNKEST FOUNDING FATHER. NOW, SNOWDEN HAS FLED TO A HONG  KONG HOTEL ROOM WHERE THE  MINIBAR HAS BEEN STOCKED WITH "NOT POISON BRAND ACTUAL BEER."  YESTERDAY SNOWDEN SAT DOWN WITH  JOURNALIST GLEN GREENWALD TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF.
I'VE BEEN A SYSTEMS ENGINEER,  SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR, SENIOR  ADVISOR FOR THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, SOLUTIONS  CONSULTANT AND A  TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION  SYSTEMS OFFICER.
Stephen: THAT'S SMART. YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR RESUME OUT  THERE BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE  ABOUT TO GET A PINK SLIP FROM THE SKY. AND AFTER ADDING THAT HE SPEAKS  FRENCH AND CAN USE POWERPOINT,  SNOWDEN WENT INTO DETAIL ABOUT THE N.S.A.'S EAVESDROPPING  PROGRAM.
THE N.S.A. SPECIFICALLY  TARGETS THE COMMUNICATIONS OF  ANYONE. ANY ANALYST AT ANY TIME CAN  TARGET ANYONE. SITTING AT MY DESK I CERTAINLY  HAD THE AUTHORITY TO WIRE TAP  ANYONE FROM YOU OR YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A FEDERAL JUDGE TO  EVEN THE PRESIDENT IF I HAD A  PERSONAL EMAIL.
Stephen: HOW HARD IS THAT? DURING THE ELECTION I GOT EMAILS  FROM HIM FIVE TIMES A DAY. FOLKS, SNOWDEN'S GOT THE PROGRAM  ALL WRONG. ACCORDING TO DIRECTOR OF  NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (CLAPS  TWICE) OOPS, SORRY. SORRY. (CLAPS TWICE) JAMES CLAPPER. CLAPPER ASSURES US THE  EAVESDROPPING PROGRAM CANNOT BE  USED TO INTENTIONALLY TARGET ANY U.S. CITIZEN. JUST LIKE THE ACUVIBE SOFT TOUCH  PERSONAL MASSAGER IS FOR NECK  CRAMPS AND CANNOT BE USED TO INTENTIONALLY TARGET ANYWHERE  ELSE. OKAY? THAT YOU CAN'T DO. THAT IS UNDER PENALTY OF WOW. FOLKS, I'LL TELL YOU, I MIGHT BE  THE ONLY ONE SAYING THIS BUT I  THINK I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE. THE GUARDIAN SAYS THAT SNOWDEN  HAD A VERY COMFORTABLE LIFE THAT  INCLUDED A SALARY OF ROUGHLY $200,000 AND A GIRLFRIEND WITH  WHOM HE SHARED A HOME IN HAWAII. NATION, I THINK THIS COULD BE  THE MOST PASSIVE AGGRESSIONIVE  BREAK-UP IN HISTORY. "HONEY, OF COURSE I'M INTO YOU. YES, I WANT CHILDREN. BUT FIRST I JUST HAVE TO LEAK A  LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE  N.S.A. AND HIDE OUT IN ASIA FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT US. I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I'M SURE  I WON'T BE MURDERED BY THE HONG  KONG TRIADS."  WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY  TOMORROW. THOUGH ONE LAST THING ON THIS. I DO FIND IT SUSPICIOUS THAT THE  SAME DAY THIS GUY FLEES TO HONG  KONG, THIS GUY FLEES TO JORDAN. TO DIRECT A "SERIOUS MOVIE?"  YEAH, THAT'S BELIEVABLE. AND DIG IT. WHO'S HIS REPLACEMENT? A FOREIGNER. N.S.A., YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO  KEEP YOUR EYE ON THIS GUY  BECAUSE HE IS SUSPICIOUS AND VERY TALENTED. NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF  ANYONE ELSE HAS NOTICED BUT  THINGS ARE PRETTY MESSED UP IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WHETHER IT'S SYRIA, IRAN, LIBYA  EGYPT, IRAQ OR SYRIA AGAIN. APPARENTLY NEW VIOLENCE BROKE  OUT WHILE I WAS LISTING THOSE  OTHER COUNTRIES. AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO  CHOOSE WHICH MIDDLE EAST COUNTRY  I SHOULD COVER SO TONIGHT I TURN TO A TIME-HONORED EDITORIAL  PROCESS: THE IMPLODING MUSLIM  COUNTRY OF THE WEEK BOOTH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME. TO THE IMPLODING MUSLIM COUNTRY  OF THE WEEK BOOTH BROUGHT TO YOU  BY SABRA HUMMUS. SERVE SABRA AT YOUR NEXT PARTY  AND YOUR GUESTS WILL BE CHANTING  "DEATH TO HUNGER." NOW, I HAVE WRITTEN THE NAME OF  EVERY MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY ON  A DIFFERENT STRIP OF COLORED PAPER FROM ALLERGY I CAN'T TO  ZEBRA-STAN. I WILL GET INTO THE BOOTH AND  GRAB ONE AT RANDOM TO REPORT ON. JIMMY, LET'S SERVE UP SOME BABA  GA-NEWS. AND THE WINNER IS... THAT TOOK  WAY LONGER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED  TO. TURKEY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YES, YES. TURKEY. JIM?
VIOLENT ANTIGOVERNMENT  PROTESTS HAVE EXPLODED  THROUGHOUT TURKEY.
DEMONSTRATORS SAY THE PRIME  MINISTER IS A DICTATOR AND THEY  WANT HIM TO RESIGN.
MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE HAVE  BEEN REPORTED HURT OVER THE LAST  WEEK.
THE STREETS OF SOME OF  TURKEY'S BIGGEST CITIES HAVE  BECOME BATTLEFIELDS. POLICE TRIED TO PUSH BACK  PROTESTERS WITH WATER CANNONS. THE AUTHORITIES FIRED TEAR GAS  INTO A CROWD OF THOUSANDS. THIS STARTED OUT AS A SMALL  DEMONSTRATION AGAINST THE  DESTRUCTION OF AN ISTANBUL PARK TO MAKE WAY FOR A SHOPPING MALL.
Stephen: WOW! THAT IS THE WORST MALL-RELATED  VIOLENCE SINCE EVERY BLACK  FRIDAY SALE. NOW IT TURNS OUT THIS WHOLE  BROUHAHA IS OVER MORE THAN JUST  SOME PARK. IT'S OVER NATIONAL IDENTITY. YOU SEE, FOR CENTURIES TURKEY  WAS AN OTTOMAN BACKWATER OF  CURVED SWORDS, DECORATIVE FOOTSTOOL AND POUTERRED  SWEETMEATS. THEN FIRST TURKISH PRESIDENT AND  KID IN PLAY TRIBUTE HEAD KE MALL  AT A TURK DRAGGED THE COUNTRY WHIRLING AND DIRVISHING INTO THE  19th CENTURY BY ABOLISHING  THE SULTANATE, THE CALIPHATE AND THE SHARIA COURTS, SOMETHING  TENNESSEE IS STILL TRYING TO DO. THE PEOPLE SEEMED TO LIKE IT. ATTA BOY ATATURK. BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN 2003  WITH THE ELECTION OF  CONSERVATIVE MUSLIM AND  AUTOCRATIC ANAGRAM RE-JEHP TA-YEEP AIR-DOE-AHN. THAT ANAGRAM, BY THE WAY, PRO  GAY CENTIPEDE RAY. NOW, PRIME MINISTER CENTIPEDE  HERE HAS UPSET SOME ISTANBULEES  BY CALLING FOR WOMEN TO HAVE AT LEAST THREE CHILDREN, SINGLE SEX  BEACHES AND NEW REGULATIONS ON  THE SALE OF ALCOHOL URGING CITIZENS TO INSTEAD DRINK AYRAN,  A SALTY MIXTURE OF YOGURT AND  WATER. BUT PLEASE GO EASY OR YOU WILL  END UP WITH A NASTY CASE OF  YOGURT GOGGLES AND WAKE UP NEXT TO A GOAT. NATION, I FEEL SO TORN. ON THE ONE HAND I'M A FAN OF  AUTHORITARIANS. ON THE OTHER HAND (WHISPERS)  HE'S A MUSLIM. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK? HERE TO TELL ME WHAT I'M  SUPPOSED TO THINK IS THE  PROFESSOR AT THE NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE, OMER TASPINAR. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FROM  THE WAR COLLEGE.
THANK YOU. Stephen: HOME OF THE FIGHTIN'  WARS. NOW LET'S TALK TURKEY, ALL  RIGHT? WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS DO  THEY HAVE A DEMOCRACY THERE?
IT IS IS PROBABLY. Stephen: PROBABLY? YOU'RE AN EXPERT. IT'S PROBABLY. IT'S LIKE A COIN TOSS ON A  DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.
THERE'S A DEBATE BECAUSE  HERE'S IS A DEMOCRATIC ELECTED  LEADERS. ERDOGAN IS DEMOCRATICALLY  ELECTED. IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD IT IS AS  DEMOCRATIC AS IT GETS.
Stephen: PRIME MINISTER  CENTIPEDE, WHAT IS GOING ON  HERE? HOW DID HE GET THESE PEOPLE SO  MAD? IT CAN'T BE JUST OVER A MALL,  RIGHT.
THERE IS A BIG SEGMENT OF OF  TURKEY INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED  WITH HIS AUTHORITARIAN  TENDENCIES. HE CONTROLS BASICALLY  COMMERCIALS.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A REALLY  GREAT PLACE TO GO HAVE FUN.
TELL ME ABOUT IT. Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO  TELL YOU?
PLEASE. Stephen: BUT WHY IS... I  DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IS THE  PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH  TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND LIKE WHERE  THE MALL GOES? THAT WOULD BE LIKE BARACK OBAMA  SAYING, "WE NEED A LEFT TURN  LANE PAST THE ARBY'S ON MAPLE STREET."  WHY IS HE MICROMANAGING LIKE  THIS?
PARTIALLY BECAUSE HE'S A  CONTROL FREAK. HE LIKES TO CONTROL THINGS. HE LIKES TO BASICALLY TELL HIS  CONSERVATIVE BASE THAT HE'S  DOING HIS UPMOST TO HAVE A CONSERVATIVE AGENDA.
WHERE IS HIS POWER BASE? IF NOT ISTANBUL, WHERE IS IT?
THE PROVINCES IN THE HEART  LAND CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS  MASSES URBAN POOR.
Stephen: BASICALLY YOU HAVE  THIS CONSERVATIVE, THE PROVINCES  AND THE HARTLAND VERSUS THE  LIBERAL...
UPPER CLASS. Stephen: IT'S LIKE AMERICA  BUT WITH BETTER KEBABS?
I COULDN'T SAY IT BETTER. Stephen: ALL RIGHT. HOW DID THIS ULTIMATELY SHAKE  OUT? LET ME TRANSLATE THAT FOR YOU? WHEN CAN I STOP CARING ABOUT  TURKEY AGAIN?
I THINK IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS  WE'LL SEE CONTINUING  POLARIZATION. IT JUST CALLED ON ITS SUPPORTERS  TO HAVE A BIG RALLY NEXT WEEK IN  ISTANBUL. DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU SEE  ONE MILLION ERDOGAN SUPPORTERS  IN THE STREETS.
Stephen: REALLY? I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE'
