Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. NATION THIS IS MY LAST SHOW  BEFORE MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY,  THE FOURTH OF JULY. WHERE THANKS TO MY WELL  STOCKED COOLER, I DECLARE  INDEPENDENCE FROM VOTING  SAFETY. WELL, FOLKS, I DO UP THE  FOURTH RIGHT. I HAVE EVERYBODY OVER. I PREPARE MY FAMOUS HOT DOGS  WITH A SECRET INGREDIENT. IT'S HEAT! (LAUGHTER)  AND SPEAKING OF DOGS, I  NEVER RING IN THE FOURTH  WITHOUT MY BOY LOU DOG. WHOOO! THE DOG IS IN THE HOUSE AND  THE DOG IS LOOSE. SERIOUSLY, HE USUALLY GETS  DRUNK ON WINE COOLERS AND  RUNS OFF. LAST YEAR I FOUND HIM NAKED  BEHIND A TRUE VALUE HARDWARE. AS OUR FOUNDERS INTENDED. CLASSIC LOU DOG. BUT SADLY, FOLKS, SOME  PEOPLE OUT THERE WANT TO  RUIN AMERICA'S SACRED  BIRTHDAY. THIS IS FOURTH OF JULY UNDER  ATTACK! (LAUGHTER)  THANK YOU, JESUS, HE'S A  GOOD GUY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME, I TRY TO  LIKE EVERYBODY. BUT THERE'S ONE PERSON I des  PIECE WITH A PASSION, NEW  YORK MAYOR MICHAEL  BLOOMBERG. (LAUGHTER)  HE HAS REPEATEDLY ATTACKED  OUR SMOKERS, HE'S ATTACKED  OUR BILL GULPS, AND NOW HE HAS ATTACKED OUR  TIME-HONORED PATRIOTIC  TRADITION.
SORRY KINDS Y FOURTH OF  WILL JULY CELEBRATION LOSING  ITS BARK, HE WANTS TO BAN THE SALE OF SPARKLERS  BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE  TERRORIST KOS USE THEM. BLOOMBERG PUSHING TO VETO A  BILL ALLOWING THE SALE OF  THEM AROUND THE WEEKS OF  FOURTH OF JULY SAYING THEY COULD GET NOT HANDS OF THE  ENEMY.
GET INTO THE HANDS OF THE  ENEMY? (LAUGHTER)  OH NO, AL QAEDA MIGHT WAIT  UNTIL DARK AND WRITE "DEATH  TO AMERICA" IN THE AIR. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HOW DARE YOU,  SIR! HOW DARE YOU! SOME OF MY HAPPIEST  CHILDHOOD MEMORIES WERE  SPENT HOLDING A 1500 DEGREE  METAL ROD. (LAUGHTER)  WELL FOLKS, I DONE CARE WHAT  MAYOR BUZZSTOMP OVER HERE  SAYS. SPARKLERS DESERVE A SEAT AT  FREEDOM'S TABLE. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT IN AN ACT  OF SKIFL DISOBEDIENCE MY  BUILDING FIRE SAFETY MARSHAL FRANK WILL NOW ENJOY SAFE  AND FUN SPARKLER. COME ON OUT HERE, FRANK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, THERE'S YOUR  SPARKLER. YOU READY TO DO THIS, BUDDY.
I DON'T THINK THE BEARD  IS A GOOD IDEA. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: COME ON, UNCLE  SAM HAS GOT TO HAVE THE  BEARD, ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS, FLAME ON. WHOOO!
Stephen: I AM SO SORRY  FOR YOUR LOSS. (LAUGHTER)  FRANK WAS A GOOD MAN. EVERYBODY SAID HE REALLY LIT  UP A ROOM. (LAUGHTER)  YOU UNDERSTAND HE HAD TO  WEAR THE BEARD, RIGHT, YOU  KNOW THAT. (LAUGHTER)  I NEVER FORGET FRANK'S LAST  WORDS, HE SAID DAMN YOU  STEPHEN COLBERT, GODDAMN YOU TO HELL. (LAUGHTER)  SOMEBODY HELP ME. (LAUGHTER)  I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT  THAT SOMEBODY WAS YOU, MARY. YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S  REMEMBER FRANK BY LIGHTING  THIS SPARKLER. (LAUGHTER)  AND THINKING OF HIM. ♪ ♪  ♪.
Stephen: KIDS, KIDS,  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE  BRAVE NOW. I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. I WISH I COULD HAVE  EXTINGUISHED YOUR PARENTS. BUT THANKS TO MAYOR BLOOMBERG  MY SODA WAS ONLY 16 OUNCES. (APPLAUSE)  SO IT'S REALLY HIS FAULT. YOU SEE THAT, DON'T YOU? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY. OKAY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL  RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? HERE, GO PLAY WITH SOME  SPARKLERS. GO ON, GO ON. HAVE SOME SPARKLERS. THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OH, OH, OH, BUT  REMEMBER, ONLY USE THEM  UNDER PARENTAL SUPER-- HAVE  FUN! OH, THEY'LL BE FINE. FOLKS, YESTERDAY THE SUPREME  COURT OVERTURNED THE DEFENSE  OF MARRIAGE ACT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I LIKE TO CHEER FOR PRETTY  COLORS TOO. BUT THEY ARE SURRENDERING  THIS COUNTRY TO THE RADICAL  GAY AGENDA OF JOINT TAX  RETURNS. IT'S UNNATURAL. BUT LUCKILY ONE TV SHOW IS  NOT BACKING DOWN. AND I HOPE IT'S THIS ONE. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S  BIG GAY ROUND UP. (APPLAUSE)  YEE WHAT! -- I WANT TO THANK MY OLD  PAL INTERNATIONAL MOVIE STAR  STEVE CAR REL FOR NEVER  ASKING ME HOW I WOULD USE THAT FOOTAGE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU'RE A GOOD  MAN. NOW FIRST IN THE GAY ROUNDUP,  FOLKS, I TRUST THE GAYS  ABOUT AS FAR AS I COULD  THROW THEM. NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW, I  DON'T PICK UP GAY MEN TO  THROW OR ANY OTHER REASON. COME TO THINK OF, IT,  THEY'RE IN BETTER SHAPE THAN  I AM SO IT MIGHT BE EASIER  TO LET THEM THROW ME BUT I GUESS I TRUST THE GAYS LESS  FAR THAN THEY COULD THROW ME,  ARE WE CLEAR? GOD, THEY HAVE TO COMPLICATE  EVERYTHING. AND NOW THEY'RE COMPLICATING  BLOOD DONATION.
THE AMERICAN MEDICAL  ASSOCIATION IS PUSHING FOR A  REVERSAL OF A DECADES-OLD BAN ON BLOOD DONATIONS FROM  GAY MEN SAYING THAT THE LAW  IS OUTDATED. GAY MEN HAVE BEEN BANNED  FROM DONATING BLOOD SINCE  THE AIDS CRISIS IN THE  1980s. BUT NOW THE AMA SAYS THERE  ARE BETTER TESTING  PROCEDURES AND BETTER  UNDERSTANDING OF HIV.
Stephen: FOLKS LETING GAY  PEOPLE DONATE BLOOD IS AN  ENDORSEMENT OF THE GAY  LIFESTYLE. IN FACT, I'M PRETTY SURE A  GAY BLOOD TRANSFUSION IS HOW  YOU GET GAY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IT'S LIKE BEING  BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE  SPIDER. YOU GET ALL THE GAY  SUPERPOWER SUPERSTRENGTH,  WEB SLINGING AND THE DESIRE  TO WEAR SKIN TIGHT SPANDEX ON BROADWAY. NEXT ON THE ROUNDUP-- , LIKE  A TRUE AMERICAN, I LOVE ALL  THINGS DISNEY. MOSTLY BECAUSE ALL THINGS  ARE OWNED BY DISNEY. (LAUGHTER)  AN MY FAVORITE SHOW IS THE  DISNEY CHANNEL GOOD LUCK  CHARLIE, A FAMILY SITCOM ABOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF  RAISING FIVE CHILDREN. NOW AS A FAN I FEEL LIKE  I'VE BEEN KICKED RIGHT IN  THE MICKEYS BECAUSE IN A  FIRST FOR THE DISNEY CHANNEL, NEXT SEASON ONE OF LITTLE  CHARLIE'S PLAY DATES WILL BE  WITH A KID WHO HAS TWO MOMS. TWO MOMS! THEY'LL PROBABLY BE HAVING  THEIR OWN PLAY DATE WITH  CRAYONS AND CONSTRUCTION  PAPER, OR AS THEY CALL IT,  SCISSORING. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OH, I KNOW, I  KNOW. UGLY STUFF. FOLKS, I AM OUTRAGED AND I  AM NOT ALONE. THE FAITH AND FREEDOM  NETWORK AND FOUNDATION  RAILED, THE ENTERTAINMENT  INDUSTRY IS DOING EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO NORMALIZE  HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONS AN ON  THE TEA PARTY NATION THEY'RE SAYING WALT DISNEY MUST BE  SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE, YES,  OR AT THE VERY LEAST SOMEONE HAS PUT HIS FROZEN HEAD ON A  LAZY SUSAN. DISNEY, I DEMAND THAT YOU  DROP THIS TWO MOMMIES PLOT  AND GO BACK TO DELIVERING  WHOLESOME MESSAGES. LIKE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN  THAT THEY CAN BE A PRINCESS  IF THEY LET A MAN MAKE OUT WITH HIM WHILE THEY'RE  DRUGGED. OR-- OR--   (APPLAUSE)  OR THAT THERE IS NOTHING  WRONG WITH BEASTIALITY IF A  CANDLE SAYS IT'S OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE)
