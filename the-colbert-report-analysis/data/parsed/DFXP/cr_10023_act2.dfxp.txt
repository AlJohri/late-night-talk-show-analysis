Stephen: WELLING COME BACK, EVERYBODY NATION, YOU KNOW ME. WHEN THE SHARKS OF THE LIBERAL MEDIA ARE CIRCLING THEIR PREY I DON'T HEAD TO SHORE. I GET A BIGGER BOAT. THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER. SLARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK.
FOLKS, THIS WEEK HELPLESS CHUM WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST AND HOMELESS COLONEL SANDERS. JIM?
"WASHINGTON POST" COLUMN NIPD RICHARD COHEN FINDS HIMSELF AT THE CENTRE OF AN INTERNET FIRESTORM FOLLOWING HIS COMMENTS ABOUT NEW YORK MAYOR PHIL DE BLASIO'S MULTIRAISE FAMILY. HE WROTE QUOTE TODAY'S GOP IS NOT RACIST, THEN GOES ON TO SAY PEOPLE WITH CONVENTIONAL VIEWS MUST REPRESS A GAG REFLEX WHEN CONSIDERING THE MAYOR ELECT OF NEW YORK. A WHITE MAN MARRIED TO A BLACK WOMAN WITH TWO BIRACIAL CHILDREN.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, I JUST HAD A CONVENTIONAL REACTION. NOW FOLKS, LET'S BE CLEAR. COHEN IS SPECIFICALLY SAYING TODAY'S GOP IS NOT RACIST. THEREFORE IT'S NOT RACIST TO GAG WHEN YOU SEE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE. A RACIST WOULD ACTUALLY THROW UP ON THEM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IT'S LIKE THROWING RICE AT A WEDDING, SOMETIMES IT ACTUALLY IS RICE. BUT OF COURSE THE INSANE SCREAM B BLEEDIA, DOESN'T GET IT. THEY'RE TEARING INTO COHEN LIKE A MOKO CHOMPING DOWN ON AN WALRUS. THEY HAVE CALLED COHEN'S WORK RACIST OP ED COLUMNS GROTESQUE AND CALLED HIM A POWER WORSHIPPING BIGOT, HORRIBLY RACIST AND STOP THIS MAN BEFORE HE WRITES SOMETHING AGAIN. FOLKS, THAT, THAT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THAT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN A LYNCH MOB IS WHAT I WOULD SAY IF I WERE RACIALLY INSENSITIVE. WHICH I'M NOT. AND NEITHER IS RICHARD COHEN. BECAUSE YESTERDAY HE RESPONDED BY SAYING WHAT I WAS DOING WAS EXPRESSING NOT MY OWN VIEWS BUT THOSE OF EXTREME RIGHT WING REPUBLICAN TEA PARTY PEOPLE. SEE, HE IS SAYING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE RACIST, NOT HIM. AND REMEMBER, IN THE COLUMN HE SAID THAT REPUBLICANS SPECIFICALLY ARE NOT RACISTS. SO EVERYBODY SHOULD BE HAPPY. AND I'M SURE HE'S WELL AWARE THAT POLLS SAY 87% OF AMERICAN AS PROVE OF INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. BUT THAT'S WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS-- PLUS I HAVE EVIDENCE THAT RICHARD COHEN IS NOT A RACIST, AFTER SEEING 12 YEARS OF-- ON NOVEMBER 4TH HE WROTE IN HIS COLUMN I SOMETIMES THINK I HAVE SPENT YEARS UNLEARNING WHAT I LEARNED EARLIER IN MY LIFE. SLAVERY WAS NOT A BENIGN INSTITUTION IN WHICH MOSTLY BENEVOLENT WHITES OWNED INNOCENT AND GRATEFUL BLACKS. OKAY, RICHARD COHEN HAS KNOWN THE SLAVERY WAS BAD FOR AT LEAST SEVEN DAYS. (LAUGHTER) AND FOR THE RECORD, TUESDAY'S COLUMN WASN'T JUST ABOUT RACE, SOME OF IT WAS ABOUT HOMOPHOBIA BECAUSE HE ADDED THE PARENTHETICAL SHOULD I MENTION THAT BILL DE BLASIO'S WIFE USED TO BE A LESBIAN? PROBABLY NOT. (LAUGHTER) SO IT'S A GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T. IT WAS PARENTHETICAL. AND NOTHING YOU SAY BETWEEN PARENTHESES COUNTS. WATCH. SHOULD I MENTION THAT RICHARD COHEN SYMPATHIZED WITH GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AFTER TRAYVON MARTIN'S DEATH? SHOULD I MENTION THAT RICHARD COHEN ONCE SUGGESTED THAT IT'S OKAY TO KEEP BLACK CUSTOMERS OUT OF YOUR STORE? SHOULD I MENTION THAT IF RICHARD COHEN ISN'T A RACIST, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS? MAYBE JUST A REALLY BAD WRITER? AND PLEASE--  (APPLAUSE) PLEASE, I DO NOT WANT ANYONE ATTACKING ME FOR SAYING THOSE THINGS. THAT'S JUST THE CONVENTIONAL REACTION TO RICHARD COHEN.
