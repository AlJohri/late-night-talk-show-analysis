( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS  AN ACTOR WHO DOES MUCH OF HIS WORK IN A PERFORMANCE CAPTURE  SUIT, EXCEPT CASUALED FROM WHEN  HE WEARS HIS CAPTURE SHORTEDS PLEASE WELCOME CAPTAIN CIRCUS.
YOU SHALL PASS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen:  WOW, WOW. IS THIS REALLY YOU? OR IS IT YOU DOING A DAZZLING  PERFORMANCE OF YOURSELF?
I'M NOT HERE. I'M A DIGITAL INCARNATION OF A  GUY BACK AT HOME IN LONDON.
Stephen:  REALLY.
YEAH.
Stephen:  REALLY. THE TECHNOLOGY IS INCREDIBLE.
IT'S AMAZING.
Stephen:  THE 3D POPS.
AT 48 FRAMES A SECOND, NO  LESS.
Stephen:  PEOPLE HAVEN'T  SEEN THAT YET. I HAVE SEEN THAT. IT'S AMAZING. IT'S-- YOU'RE SO IN THE WORLD,  IT'S LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING THE  MOVIE THROUGH A WINDOW. YOU'RE A WITNESS TO THE MOVIE IN  SOME WAYS.
YOU'RE ALMOST BACK OUT THE  OTHER SIDE AND WATCHING IT FROM  THE BACK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW  ENOUGH ABOUT MOVIES TO KNOW WHAT  THE ( BLEEP ) YOU JUST SAID. BUT I TRUST YOU. YOU'RE THE GENIUS. YOU'RE THE GODFATHER OF.
.
SOUL?
Stephen:  YOU COULD  PROBABLY PLAY JAMES BROWN. YOU'RE THE PREMIERE PERFORMANCE  CAPTURE ARTIST. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  PERFORMANCE CAPTURE AND MOTION  CAPTURE?
PERFORMANCE CAPTURE IS THE  LATER ITERATION IF YOU LIKE. YOU MAY USE THAT WORD. MOTION CAPTURE IS BASICALLY WHAT  YOU USED BACK IN THE DAY WITH  VIDEO GAMES WHERE YOU HAVE A MARTIAL ARTIST.
Stephen:  PING-PONG  BECAUSES.
PERFORMANCE CAPTURE IS  BASICALLY CAPTURING THE ENTIRE  PERFORMANCE IN ONE HIT. WE CAN BE DOING A SCENE HEREBY  THE LIVE ACTION CAMERA IS  FILMING YOU, AND A HEAD-MOUNTED CAMERA CAPTURES THE ENTIRE  PERFORMANCE IN ONE HIT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND  REPEAT ANYTHING. IT'S JUST ANOTHER WAY OF  RECORDING AN ACTOR'S  PERFORMANCE.
Stephen:  WHEN WE WERE IN  NEW ZEALAND LAST YEAR ON SET FOR  THE HOBIT, I WENT OVER-- MR. JACKSON SHOWED ME A LITTLE  CUT OF THE FILM AND WE HAVE A  CLIP TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE. IT'S PART OF THE RIDDLE THEME. I SAW THIS WITH JUST YOU. AND THEN I SAW IT, AND IT'S ALL  YOU. I SAW--
IT IS NOT ALL ME.
Stephen:  IT IS, IT'S ALL  YOU. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. JIM, SHOW HIM WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT.
WHAT IS IT? MY NAME IS BILLBO BAGINS.
WHAT IS THAT?
I'M A HOBIT.
OH! WE LIKE HOBITS. SO SOFT. IS IT JUICY?
NOW, NOW-- I'LL DO THIS IF I  HAVE TO. I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? JUST SHOW ME THE WAY TO GET OUT  OF HERE, AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY. I WANT TO GET UNLOCKED AS FAST  AS POSSIBLE.
SHUT UP!
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  MAYBE-- MAYBE A  BETTER GOLLUM THAN "LORD OF THE  RINGS."
HE'S A LOT HOTTER BASICALLY  THIS TIME AROUND.
Stephen:  HE'S YOUNGER.
HE'S 60 YEARS YOUNGER AND  LOOKS --
Stephen:  HOW OLD IS HE?
540.
Stephen:  YOU CAN REALLY  SEE IT AROUND THE EYES. ( LAUGHTER ). WAS IT-- WAS IT HARD TO DO  GOLLUM AGAIN? HOW LONG BETWEEN PERFORMANCES  WAS IT?
WE STARTED SHOOTING "LORD OF  THE RINGS" IN 1999, FINISHED IN  2003. IT'S A GOOD NINE, 10 YEARS-- 10  YEARS. WELL, WHAT WAS WEIRD ABOUT IT,  COMING BACK TO YOU IT, THERE HAD  BEEN SO MANY IMPERSONATIONS FOR  GOLLUM. ON A DAILY BASIS PEOPLE COME UP  AND DO THEIR GOLLUM FOR ME. I HAVE ONE.
Stephen:  I'M GOLLUM, SEE. I RUN THIS TOWN. STICK 'EM UP.
CAN I GIVE YOU A FEW TIPS?
Stephen:  SURE.
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO DO  THIS. JUST IMAGINE, JUST IMAGINE THAT  YOU'RE COUGHING UP A FUR BALL. YOU'RE A CAT COUGHING UP A FUR  BALL, OKAY? YEAH. OKAY. NOW YOU'VE GOT TO TRAP YOUR  VOICE WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT. YUP. AND NOW SAY GOLLUM. ( APPLAUSE ).   ( CHEERS )
Stephen:  I SOUND A LITTLE  BIT LIKE DONALD DUCK. OKAY, SO HOW DO YOU GET TBAK  INTO IT? DID YOU ACTUALLY GO WATCH  YOURSELF AS GOLLUM TO BE GOLLUM?
NO, NO. I DIDN'T DO THAT. I DON'T LIKE WATCHING MYSELF. BUT ACTUALLY, WHAT WAS GREAT WAS  MARTIN FREEMAN. IT WAS THE FIRST THING SHOT ON  THE MOVIE.
Stephen:  REALLY?
THAT SCENE WAS THE VERY, VERY  FIRST SCENE SHOT IN PRINCIPAL  PHOTOGRAPHY. WE DID IT ALL IN ONE HIT. IT WAS LIKE A THEATER PIECE,  REALLY.
Stephen:  REALLY, LIKE  MULTIPLE CAMERAS?
BASICALLY OVER THE COURSE OF  THE WEEK WE DID THAT SCENE ALL  THE WAY THROUGH, ALL THE WAY THROUGH, AND MAY OR MAY NOT WAS  FINDING HIS WAY --
Stephen:  THAT'S THE VERY  FIRST THING HE DID AS THE  CHARACTER.
WE JUST PLAYED OFF EACH GLURG  WERE LIKE HIS GUY.
EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
Stephen:  HOW LONG--  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE  CAESAR IN "RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES."  YOU WERE KING KONG. HOW LONG BEFORE YOU ARE JUST  EVERYBODY IN A MOVIE? ( LAUGHTER )  LIKE BOTH SIDES OF A LOVE  INTEREST AND WE JUST WATCH YOU  MAKE LOVE TO YOURSELF.
THAT PLAN. THAT IS THE PLAN. I'M ACTUALLY WORKING TOWARDS  THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING I REALLY,  REALLY WANT TO DO.
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME, ANDY. ANDY CIRCUS, THE
