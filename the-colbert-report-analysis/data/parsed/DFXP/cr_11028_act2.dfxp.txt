Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUEST IS THE HOST  OF THE LIBERAL ELITIST DAILY SHOW, AND THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE EMMY AWARD WINNING COLBERT REPORT,  PLEASE WELCOME JON STEWART.  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen:  JON, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] IS THAT HOW YOU INTRODUCE THE GUEST EVERY NIGHT?
Stephen:  EVERY NIGHT. I SAY IT OVER THERE AND I RUN OVER HERE.
SEEMS A LITTLE SELF AGGRANDIZING
Stephen: YES
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW SUSTAINABLE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WILL BE
Stephen:  12 MORE SHOWS, JON
UNBELIEVABLE
Stephen: 12 MORE SHOWS, JON. SAVOR ME. SAVOR ME LIKE A HERSHEY'S KISS, JON, SOON I'LL BE JUST AS RARE WELCOME TO MY PARLOR SAID THE SPIDER TO THE FLY.
OH BOY, ARE YOU GOING TO NAIL ME? I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NAIL ME MY FRIEND.
I USED TO BE INSIDE THE BELLY OF THE BEAST. I USED TO WORK FOR YOU. YOU FORGOT. I REMEMBER THINGS   YOU SAID BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND TONIGHT I CAN REVEAL THAT FOR 15 YEARS, I USED TO BE OVER THERE WITH YOUR WRITERS AND THEIR OPIUM BONGS. HOW MANY  WRITERS DO YOU HAVE, JON? 50? HOW MANY WRITERS?
I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU AND YOU KNOW THIS,  BEHIND CLOSED DOORS I ONLY QUOTE RABBINICCAL TEXT, YOU KNOW THAT. THERE IS NO CLOSED DOORS, NO HIDDEN AGENDA, I AM MERELY AN  ARBITER OF BIBLICAL LAW. YOU KNOW THAT, YOU'VE BEEN THERE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A TALMUDIC DISCUSSION, I'M HAPPY TO HAVE IT
Stephen:  THERE ARE SCRIBES WRITING DOWN EVERYTHING YOU SAY. ON VELLUM
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU SAY LET IT BE WRITTEN.
THANK YOU. AND I'VE OPENED EVERY MEETING,   I'VE DONE THIS FOR 16 YEARS. ON THE ONE HAND. [LAUGHTER] BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW I'VE ALWAYS OPERATED.
Stephen: NOW AS A LIBERAL LION, JON,  AS THE VOICE OF THE LEFT, YOU KNOW MORE YOUNG PEOPLE  GET THEIR NEWS FROM YOU.
MOST YOUNG PEOPLE.  87% OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM ME MILLENIALS. AND BY THE WAY, THOSE WHO DON'T GET THEIR NEWS FROM ME FROM THE SHOW, I WILL GO TO THEIR DORM ROOMS. I GO INTO THE DORM ROOMS AND I WILL GIVE THEM GENERALLY USUALLY A SYNOPSIS. I AM LIKE SANTA. I COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY OF THE LIBERAL DORM ROOM.
Stephen:  RUN DOWN THE BIG NEWS, HERE'S YOUR DIME BAG AND OUT YOU GO. [CROWD CHEERING]
EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO.
Stephen:  IT'S THE DIME BAG BECAUSE YOU'RE ON BASIC CABLE.
UNLESS THEY'RE HIGH THE IDEAS DON'T SEEP IN BECAUSE.
Stephen:  YOU WEAKEN THEIR MINDS.
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE, AND IF I MAY SAY THIS.
Stephen:  PLEASE.
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD AS WE DO.
Stephen:  ACTIVATE THE YOUTH VOTE, JON. THAT'S ONE THING, YOUR ENTIRE CAREER WAS TO ACTIVATE THE YOUTH VOTE.
WE TRIED DESPERATELY TRIED TO ACTIVATE THE YOUTH VOTE.
Stephen: BUT ONLY 21% OF THE YOUTH VOTED IN THE LAST ELECTION HOW DOES IT FEEL TO KNOW YOUR ENTIRE CAREER WOULD JUST AS WELL HAVE BEEN SHOUTED INTO A SOCK AND THROWN OFF AN OVERPASS?
THAT'S UNFAIR.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE WASTED YOUR LIFE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE OF THIS MAN.
