Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW FRONT  LINE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT TWO  MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. WOW, HE TALKED TO BOTH OF THEM. PLEASE WELCOME BILL MOYERS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BILL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. YOU HAVE BEEN A BROADCAST LEGEND  FOR MANY YEARS. YOU HAVE 30 EMMYS. YOU HAVE NINE PEABODIES. YOUR CURRENT SHOW IS MOYERS AND  COMPANY ON AMERICAN PUBLIC  TELEVISION. AND YOU ALSO HAVE A FRONT LINE  DOCUMENTARY. THESE ARE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN  FOLLOWING SINCE THE 1990s,  CORRECT?
YES, MY PRODUCERS INSPIRED BY  MY WIFE, IT WAS HER IDEA, HAD  BEEN FOLLOWING THESE SAME TWO FAMILIES EVER SINCE THE BREAD  WINNER IN EACH FAMILY, THE TOP  BREAD WINNER, LOST THEIR GOOD FACTORY JOB. THEY HAD BEEN STRUGGLING EVER  SINCE COURAGEOUSLY BUT AGAINST  GREAT ODDS TO TRY TO FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE NEW GLOBAL ECONOMY.
Stephen: OKAY. IT'S CALLED TWO AMERICAN  FAMILIES. IT AIRS JULY 9 AT 10:00 P.M. ON  FRONT LINE ON PBS, CORRECT?
CORRECT  Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW WHY DO WE NEED A MIDDLE  CLASS? DO WE NEED ONE?
IT'S WHERE MOST OF US CAN GO  Stephen: WE CAN GO TO THE  UPPER CLASS OR THE LOWER CLASS. THERE ARE TWO OTHER CLASS  CATEGORIES OPEN TO AMERICANS.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE MIDDLE CLASS WHICH IS THE  STRENGTH OF A DEMOCRACY BECAUSE  THEY HAVE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND A BELIEF IN THE FUTURE, THEY  BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY, THEY'RE  FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS.
Stephen: BUT THE LOWER CLASS  STAYS HUNGRY. ISN'T THAT WHAT MAKES AMERICA  GREAT, PEOPLE WHO ARE STRIVING  TO HAVE BETTER LIVES? AND THE MORE PEOPLE WE MAKE  STRIVE, THE STRONGER OUR COUNTRY  BECOMES.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY  MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY. THERE ARE 49 MILLION PEOPLE IN  THIS COUNTRY USING FOOD STAMPS  NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE ON WELFARE BUT BECAUSE JOBS PAY SO  LOW THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD A  DECENT MEAL. THEY CAN'T AFFORD A DECENT  LIVELIHOOD. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I FOR ONE FIND IT  OFFENSIVE THAT YOU WOULD APPLAUD  FOR PEOPLE NOT HAVING ENOUGH  FOOD. SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. OKAY. BUT SO IS THIS THE FAULT OF THE  PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET THE JOB? PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. BILL. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.
THAT'S WHAT THE NETWORK KEEPS  PROMOTING BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE. IT IS NOT THE CASE. YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO  DOCUMENTARIES ON THESE TWO  FAMILIES. WHEN THEY LOST THEIR GOOD-PAYING  FACTORY JOBS THEY DID EVERYTHING  THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY WORKED TWO SHIFTS AND THEY  FOUND THEMSELVESES MAKING HALF  OF WHAT THEY WERE MAKING WHEN THEY WERE IN THE MANUFACTURING  BUSINESS. THAT WASN'T THEIR FAULT
Stephen: THAT'S EVOLUTION. THAT'S THE FREE MARKET. THAT'S THE FREE MARKET. I THINK THE MIDDLE CLASS DID IT  THEMSELVES. THEY UNIONIZED, THEY DEMANDED  BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS. THEY DEMANDED BETTER PAY. AND WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SHIP  THE JOBS OVERSEAS. THAT'S BUSINESS THOUGH. YOU UNDERSTAND BUSINESS. YOU BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM.
I DO UNDERSTAND BUSINESS. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG TODAY. YOU KNOW, THE FACT OF THE MATTER  IS THE CAPITALIST CLASS HAS... IT'S LIKE...
Stephen: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT  MY FRIENDS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS GROWING  UP IN TEXAS AND YOU WERE GROWING  UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA WE DIDN'T PRAY, "GIVE ME THIS DAY MY DAILY  BREAD."  THAT'S THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE. THE POWERFUL TAKE WHAT THEY WANT  AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS LEFT TO  GET WHAT THEY CAN. WE PRAYED, "GIVE US OUR DAILY  BREAD."
Stephen: THE LORD'S PRAYER IS  AN US NOT AN I. GIVE ME THIS DAY MY DAILY BREAD. SCREW THE OTHER GUY.
YOU GOT IT. Stephen: THERE'S ALWAYS TIME  FOR AMENDMENTS.
YOU KNOW, STEVE, THE BASIC  PREMISE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS  THAT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO HAVE A  BETTER LIFE, A GOOD LIFE, AND  YOU CAN MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILDREN. THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. MY FRIEND JIM HIGHTOWER, THE  POPULIST IN TEXAS SAYS THE REAL  QUESTION IS NOT WHY SO MANY PEOPLE FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY ARE  THERE ARE SO MANY CRACKS?
Stephen: CAN WE TALK ABOUT  ONE OTHER THING? YOU WORK FOR L.B.J. YOU WERE THERE WHEN THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT WAS PASSED IN 1965.
IN THE ROOM. Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK HE  WOULD SAY TO THE SUPREME COURT  FOR THEIR DECISION YESTERDAY AND KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A FAMILY  SHOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE WOULD SAY? HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY  CLARENCE THOMAS WHO WOULD NOT BE  ON THE SUPREME COURT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT PULLED THE LADDER UP AFTER  HIM
Stephen: CLARENCE THOMAS  BEING ON THE SUPREME COURT AND  BARACK OBAMA BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE PROVES WE DON'T NEED THE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT ANYMORE.
NO IT DOESN'T  Stephen: ONCE THE RIVER BED  IS DRY, ONCE THE RIVER BED IS DRY, YOU CAN PULL DOWN THE DAM.
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE  TRYING TO DO
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT  CONGRESS CAN PASS ANOTHER VOTING  RIGHTS ACT. HOW HARD WAS IT THE FIRST TIME.
VERY DIFFICULT. WHEN THAT DECISION CAME DOWN  YESTERDAY YOU KNOW WHO I WAS  THINKING OF, JOHN LEWIS WHO WAS BEATEN ALMOST TO DEATH IN 1961  ON THE FREEDOM RIDE WHO WAS  ALMOST BEATEN TO DEATH ON THE BRIDGE BETWEEN SELMA AND  MONTGOMERY WHEN THEY WERE  FIGHTING FOR VOTING RIGHTS. I THOUGHT OF ALL THOSE NOW  FORGOTTEN MARTYRS, YOUNG BLACK  MEN AND WOMEN WHO DIED FIGHTING FOR VOTING RIGHTS. I THOUGHT OF A MAN BEATEN TWO OR  THREE TIMES. I THOUGHT OF ALL OF THOSE GUYS  WHO STOOD UP SO THAT EVERYONE IN  THIS COUNTRY IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE, RELIGION, CREED, INCOME,  WE'RE ALL EKE QUUL IN THAT  VOTING BOOTH I THOUGHT OF THEM. IT WAS A BETRAYAL OF THEIR  MARTYRDOM THAT THIS COURT SAID  IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY FOR YOU TO GO BACK AND TRY TO PUT  DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AGAINST  VOTING IN DIFFERENT PLACES. THEY TRIED LAST YEAR. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU TAWGD ABOUT IT ON THE SHOW. THE VOTER I.D., THE OTHER  EFFORTS TO DISQUALIFY VOTERS AT  THE POLLS. THEY'RE NOW ENCOURAGED TO DO  THAT. THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID GO  AND DO LIKEWISE
Stephen: AGAIN IF IT DOESN'T  WORK OUT, IF THERE IS STILL  DISCRIMINATORY RACIAL DISCRIMINATORY ACTION AT THE  POLLS TO TRY TO DISENFRANCHISE  BLACK PEOPLE OR LATINOS OR ANYONE ELSE, WE'LL JUST BRING  L.B.J. BACK FROM THE GRAVE.
AND MARTIN LUTHER KING WHO  SAID THE LONG ARC OF HISTORY  TENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE. IN TIME THE RACISTS IN THE  SOUTH -- AND THEY'RE STILL  THERE, IN YOUR STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND MY STATE OF  TEXAS -- THEY WILL BE OVERCOME  BY THE SHEER WEIGHT OF NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT, BLACKS  AND HISPANICS AND OTHER PEOPLE  WHO WILL NOT PUT UP WITH BEING TREATED AGAIN AS THEY HAD BEEN  FOR SO LONG. THE NUMBERS WILL WIN IN THE LONG  RUN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: BILL, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. BILL MOYERS. FRONT LINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
