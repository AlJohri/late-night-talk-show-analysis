Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, AND WAS RECENTLY NAMED PERMANENT GUEST HOST OF THE "THE COLBERT REPORT." PLEASE WELCOME PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
Stephen: HAD TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE TASE. SORRY. DIDN'T MEAN TO STEAL YOUR THUNDER THERE, SIR. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I WILL HAVE TO SAY, I FELT MORE POWERFUL BEHIND THAT DESK.
Stephen: WITH GREAT POWER COMES MEDIUM CABLE RATINGS. NOW, TO SPEAK OF WHICH, YOU'RE THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.
I AM.
Stephen: GOT YOUR FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR TRIGGER, YOU STEERED THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: -- I AM THE HOST OF A CABLE SHOW FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK. GUYS LIKE US UNDERSTAND LEADERSHIP. OKAY? (LAUGHTER) WE UNDERSTAND LEADERSHIP. ARE YOU STILL PRESIDENT AFTER THE MIDTERMS? BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS ARE QUITE SURPRISED THAT YOU'RE DOING ANYTHING AT ALL (LAUGHTER) THAT SHELLACKING DIDN'T RATTLE THE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL OFF YOUR PODIUM? (LAUGHTER)
LOOK, THE ELECTION DIDN'T GO AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED... (LAUGHTER) YOU'LL NOTICE I MADE A LITTLE  CORRECTION THERE. I HAD A LITTLE THOUGHT BUBBLE. (LAUGHTER) BUT AS PRESIDENT, THE ONLY OFFICE WHERE YOU'RE ELECTED BY PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES, AND MY INTENTION IS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS IS TO MAKE SURE, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WORKING WITH CONGRESS, WE CAN GET EVERYTHING WE CAN DO DONE TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES GET AHEAD, TO MAKE SURE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
YEAH.
Stephen: WE HAVE A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT HERE TONIGHT. THE YOUNG PEOPLE DID NOT TURN OUT TO VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. CAN WE SEE A SHOW OF HANDS, HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED. (CHEERING) THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
NOT BAD.
Stephen: THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY A CROWD OF YOUNG PEOPLE RAISING THEIR HANDS TO THEIR CHARISMATIC LEADER IS DISTURBING. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WHY, SIR -- AND DON'T GIVE THEM ANY HINTS -- WHY DO YOU THINK THE YOUNG PEOPLE DID NOT COME OUT TO VOTE?
I THINK THEY FELT DISCOURAGED ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON.
Stephen: MM-HMM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUES, YOUNG PEOPLE AGREE WE SHOULD RAISE MINIMUM-WAGE, HAVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, THEY AGREE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE A FAMILY, WHEN THE CHILD GETS SICK, YOU CAN STAY HOME WITHOUT LOSING YOUR JOB. THEY BELIEVE IN MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. THEY BELIEVE IN THESE THINGS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAD CONSISTENTLY HOUSE REPUBLICANS BLOCKING ACTION ON THOSE ITEMS AND AT A CERTAIN POINT FOCUS FIGURED, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PART OF MY JOB IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND HOPEFULLY PART OF THE JOB OF MITCH McCONNELL AND JOHN BOEHNER IS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT, EVEN IN DIVIDED GOVERNMENT, WE CAN STILL PUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AHEAD OF POLITICS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS. YOU KNOW, I'M FIRM BUT FAIR AND YOU HAD SOME GOOD NEWS  THIS WEEK I'D LIKE TO TELL THE PEOPLE ABOUT. THE JOBS REPORT CAME OUT FOR NOVEMBER. 321,000 NEW JOBS IN NOVEMBER (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE ECONOMY IS GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN IN YEARS. WHY DIDN'T YOU FIX THE ECONOMY BEFORE THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS? YOU KNOW YOUR JOB, BUT I WOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE THE ELECTIONS SO PEOPLE WERE HAPPY WHEN THEY VOTED. AND YOU WIN AND THEN MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME ON "THE COLBERT REPORT."
ACTUALLY, THE TRUTH IS THE ECONOMY HAD BEEN ON A PRETTY GOOD RUN. WE'VE HAD 57 STRAIGHT MONTHS OF PRIVATE SECTOR JOB  GROWTH, OVER 10 MILLION JOBS CREATED, MANUFACTURING  STRONGEST SINCE THE '90s. THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS REBOUNDED BACK.
Stephen: I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU, YOU'VE EMPLOYED A LOT OF PEOPLE --
WE HAVE.
Stephen: -- MOSTLY AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.
WELL, THAT BOOSTED OUR NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT. (APPLAUSE) WHAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE ENOUGH OF UNTIL RECENTLY IS WAGES AND INCOMES GOING UP. THIS LAST JOBS REPORT STARTED TO INDICATE SOME WAGE GROWTH, BUT WE'VE STILL GOT MORE WORK TO DO.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT CREATING JOBS AND TALK ABOUT OUR NORTHERN BORDER. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE. CONGRESS IS GONNA PASS THAT NOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN THERE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IT, IT'S GONNA CREATE JOBS, THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT'S NOT GONNA RAISE THE POLLUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE,   YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN THAT, RIGHT? (AUDIENCE BOOING)
OBVIOUSLY, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WEREN'T POLLED.
Stephen: NO, THEY'RE CHANTING "DOOO-IT"! (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN THAT, RIGHT?
KEYSTONE IS GOING THROUGH AN EVALUATION PROCESS NOW, BEING HELD UP BY A COURT IN NEBRASKA, MAKING A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THE ROUTE IS LEGAL OR NOT. YOU KNOW, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, I DON'T MAKE THE INITIAL DECISIONS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT EVALUATES IT.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SIGN IT WHEN THE BILL COMES TO YOU?
WHAT I SAID IS I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE LOOK AT THIS OBJECTIVELY, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT ADDING TO THE PROBLEM OF CARBON AND CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WE ALREADY KNOW TEMPERATURES ARE GOING UP, AND KEYSTONE IS A POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR OF THAT. WE HAVE TO EXAMINE THAT AND WEIGH THAT AGAINST THE AMOUNT OF JOBS IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO CREATE, WHICH AREN'T A LOT. ESSENTIALLY, IT'S CANADIAN OIL PASSING THROUGH THE UNITED STATES TO BE SOLD ON THE WORLD MARKET. NOT GOING TO PUSH DOWN GAS PRICES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S GOOD FOR CANADA. IT COULD CREATE A COUPLE THOUSAND JOBS IN THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIPELINE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO MEASURE THAT AGAINST WHETHER OR NOT IT IS GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO AN OVERALL WARMING OF THE PLANET THAT COULD BE DISASTROUS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION? I HAVE A SUGGESTION. I HAVE A SUGGESTION THAT I THINK MIGHT KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE KEYSTONE HERE, ALL RIGHT?
GO AHEAD.
Stephen: THIS ONE'S FREE, OK? YOU CAN USE THIS.  WE DON'T BUILD IT DOWN TO LOUISIANA. WE TAKE IT OVER  THE CANADIAN BORDER, BUILD THAT PIPE ALL THE WAY OVER THE MEXICAN BORDER, WE LEAVE THE OTHER END OF IT OPEN WITH A SIGN THAT SAYS MUCHO JOBSO. THE PEOPLE TAKE THE THING ALL THE WAY OVER THE BORDER, THEY END UP IN CANADA, AND THE CANADIANS ARE TOO POLITE TO KICK THEM OUT AND THERE'S YOUR IMMIGRATION POLICY. TAKEN CARE OF. THAT'S FREE. (APPLAUSE)
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RIDICULOUS IDEA. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE WHERE YOU ARE AND I AM WHERE I AM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR JUST ONE MOMENT?
YES.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
