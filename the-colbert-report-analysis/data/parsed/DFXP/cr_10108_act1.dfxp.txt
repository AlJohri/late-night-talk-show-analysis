(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! (AUDIENCE CHANTING)
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU. NATION, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOUR SPIRITS ARE UP BECAUSE I COME TO YOU TONIGHT WITH TERRIFYING NEWS -- THE INTERNET IS UNDER ATTACK! SHUT OFF YOUR SMARTPHONES, CLOSE YOUR LAPTOPS AND REMAIN FOCUSED ON YOUR TV. (LAUGHTER) UNLESS YOU'RE WATCHING ME ONLINE RIGHT NOW, IN WHICH CASE, TO KEEP YOU SAFE, I'M GOING TO CLOSE ALL YOUR OTHER TABS. HERE WE GO. YOU'RE WELCOME. BECAUSE FOLKS -- (LAUGHTER) WE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL, BECAUSE OUR FRENEMIES IN CHINA ARE SPINNING A WORLDWIDE WEB OF LIES. JIM?
THE U.S. CYBER WAR ESCALATING TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, CHARGES ARE BEING FILED AGAINST CHINESE STATE OFFICIALS ACCUSING THEM OF ESPIONAGE.
THE HACKERS ARE WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY TO PILFER INFORMATION FROM U.S. COMPANIES.
FIVE OFFICIALS WORK FOR A SUPERSECRET SPY CELL KNOWN AS UNIT 61398 BELIEVED TO BE HOUSED IN THIS 12-STORY BUILDING IN SHANGHAI.
Stephen: YES, CYBER SPIES! IT'S LIKE BEING A REGULAR SPY BUT INSTEAD OF A TUXEDO YOU   WEAR AN ADVENTURE TIME T-SHIRT WITH NACHO STAINS. (LAUGHTER) THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS PUT OUT THIS WANTED POSTER TO HELP US IDENTIFY THESE DANGEROUS ONLINE CRIMINALS. SO LOOK FOR IT AT THE POST OFFICE, WHEN YOU GO PICK UP YOUR EMAIL. (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S A TRUE ROGUE'S GALLERY. FOR INSTANCE, GUI CHUNHUI -- WHO ALSO GOES BY THE ALIAS KANDYGOO, A CLEVER WAY TO PASS FOR AN AMERICAN, NAME YOURSELF AFTER OUR TWO MOST POPULAR FOODS -- AND THE INFAMOUS WANG DONG, WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH TRANSLATES TO PETER JOHNSON, JR. (LAUGHTER) IT IS ABOUT TIME THEY NAILED WANG DONG! I GET EMAIL OFFERS FROM WANG DONG ALL THE TIME AND THE PILLS HE SOLD ME NEVER ARRIVED. NOW HOW WILL SHE CALL ME MR. PLEASURE AT SIGHT OF EXTRAORDINARY POWER MANHOOD? IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE AN EDGE TO CHINESE INDUSTRIES, THESE GUYS STOLE TRADE SECRETS FROM CORPORATIONS LIKE WESTINGHOUSE, U.S. STEEL, ALCOA AND THE RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPANY SOLAR WORLD. OF COURSE, THE CHINESE CAN'T DO THEIR OWN SOLAR RESEARCH SINCE THEY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THE SUN. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS IS A MAJOR THREAT TO OUR FINANCIAL FUTURE. THE CHINESE ALREADY KNOW HOW TO MANUFACTURE ALL OUR ELECTRONICS. NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO DESIGN THEM. IF THEY ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUY THEM AND DROP THEM IN THE TOILET WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK, AMERICA WILL HAVE NO ROLE IN THE WORLD ECONOMY! AND JUST LISTEN TO THE DEVIOUS WAY THEY CYBER HACKED OUR MAINFRAME-BOTS
A FAVORITE TECHNIQUE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS, SPEAR FISHING, SENDING AN INNOCUOUS LOOKING EMAIL THAT WHEN OPENED SECRETLY INSTALLS MALWARE LETTING THE HACKERS GET ACCESS TO COMPANY DATA.
Stephen: THIS EXPLOITS A WEAKNESS IN OUR ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE, THE FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE EMPLOYEE WILL CLICK ON ANYTHING. THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM, THAT ONE STUPID EMPLOYEE. I MEAN, HOW HARD CAN IT BE JUST TO NOT CLICK ON AN EMAIL? I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE. HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. OPEN YOUR EMAIL, OKAY, AND IF YOU SEE A MESSAGE FROM SOMEONE YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE, YOU DELETE IT. NOW, THE NEXT THING YOU DO -- HOLD ON (COMPUTER SOUND)
Stephen: JUST GOT AN EMAIL FROM MR. AMERICA Q. SAFETYTRUST, SUBJECT "BIG JOB PROMOTION MEETING OPEN NOW." SOUNDS IMPORTANT. HERE WE GO. HMM, NOTHING IN HERE ABOUT THE PROMOTION. MAYBE IT'S AN ATTACHMENT. OH, HEY! IT'S A GAME! I JUST TAKE THE FILES ON MY DESKTOP AND FEED THEM TO THIS HUNGRY PANDA. OH! HE SMILED WHEN HE ATE OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY MEMO! UH-OH, TIME'S RUNNING OUT. I'D BETTER PUT EVERYTHING IN ONE FOLDER. EAT QUICK! HIGH SCORE! WOO-HOO! YOU KNOW WHO WOULD LOVE THIS? MY BUDDY WHO WORKS AT THE PENTAGON AND -- FORWARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, LAST WEEK, MY GOOD FRIEND KARL ROVE POSED AN INNOCENT QUESTION -- DOES HILLARY  CLINTON HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE? AND EVER SINCE KARL FLOATED THIS IDEA OR "DROPPED A FLOATER" AS WE SAY IN THE PUNDIT GAME, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS FACED ACCUSATIONS THEY ARE A BUNCH OF SCAREDY CATS.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE SO AFRAID OF A HILLARY CLINTON CANDIDACY THEY HOPE TO TALK HER OUT OF RUNNING.
KARL ROVE IS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF HILLARY CLINTON.
THIS IS SUCH A BUNCH OF NONSENSE AND I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES HOW UTTERLY AFRAID THEY ARE OF HER.
Stephen: RIDICULOUS. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF HILLARY CLINTON. IF WE WERE, WHY WOULD BY LAUGHING LIKE THIS? (STARTS OUT LAUGHING, ENDS UP SOBBING) (LAUGHTER) BESIDES, HILLARY IS THE ONE WHO'S SCARED, JUST ASK R.N.C. CHAIRMAN AND HARRY POTTER INCANTATION REINCE PRIEBUS! JIM, JIM, ACCIO CLIP!
IS SHE THE CANDIDATE THAT YOU AS THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MUST FEAR?
NO, I DON'T FEAR. I THINK HILLARY IS A KNOWN PRODUCT. GIVEN THE MONTH SHE JUST HAD, I DOUBT SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016.
Stephen: FOLKS, I BELIEBUS PRIEBUS. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WHY WOULD HILLARY RUN? IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, SHE FACED NEW BENGHAZI ALLEGATIONS,  RETURN OF MONICA LEWINSKY, KARL ROVE SPECULATING ON HER BRAIN  DAMAGE AND THE RUMORS THAT THE ONLY WAY SHE GOT INTO THE WHITE    HOUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BY SLEEPING WITH THE PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) A LIE? PROBABLY. BUT ALL THOSE QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER -- (APPLAUSE) -- ALL THOSE QUESTIONS OF CHARACTER HAVE TO PUT A STRAIN ON HER. I KNOW COMING UP WITH THEM PUT A STRAIN ON ME. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SOUNDS FUN BUT THIS ISN'T THE '90s WHEN REPUBLICANS PAMPERED THE CLINTONS BY MERELY ACCUSING THEM OF MURDERING VINCE FOSTER, ONE OF THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS. THIS IS 2014, AND POLITICS ARE REALLY DIRTY NOW. TAKE THE MISSISSIPPI SENATE RACE WHERE JUST THIS WEEKEND A CONSERVATIVE BLOGGER WENT INTO A NURSING HOME, PHOTOGRAPHED THE BED RIDDEN WIFE OF REPUBLICAN SENATOR THAD COCHRAN WITHOUT PERMISSION AND POSTED THE IMAGE ONLINE. IF THAT'S WHAT CONSERVATIVES ARE WILLING TO DO TO EACH OTHER, JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO  DO WITH HILLARY'S   SECRET BED-RIDDEN WIFE. NOW I'M NOT SAYING MRS. CLINTON'S IN A LONG-TERM COMMITTED LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH A MATURE AND HANDSOME WOMAN NAMED DIANE. I'M JUST SAYING IT'S OUT THERE NOW AND IF SHE DENIES IT,  HOW IS DIANE GONNA FEEL? I'M MEAN, SHE'S SO SICK. SO YOU'D BETTER THINK TWICE, HILLARY. AFTER ALL, THE ELECTION IS STILL TWO YEARS AWAY, AND WE'VE ALREADY POPPED OPEN A CAN METAPHORICAL WHOOP-ASS.
KARL ROVE MAY HAVE THROWN THE FIRST PUNCH.
LET'S REMEMBER, IF SHE GOES INTO THE POLITICAL FRAY, INTO  THAT RING, THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND THE BELL IS RINGING.
I THINK WHAT KARL ROVE DID IN THAT LITTLE COMMENT IS HE GAVE A REAL SIGNAL TO THE CLINTONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO PLAY, GLOVES WILL BE OFF, DON'T THINK WE'LL GIVE SPECIAL TREATMENT TO MRS. CLINTON BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN.
Stephen: UH-UH! DING DING! GLOVES ARE COMING OFF! THIS IS HAND TO HAND COMBAT AND THE G.O.P. WILL NOT BE THE JAY-Z TO HILLARY'S SOLANGE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR ONE THING, REPUBLICANS WOULD NEVER GET INTO AN ELEVATOR WITH THAT MANY BLACK PEOPLE! (LAUGHTER) FOR ANOTHER, JUST BECAUSE HILLARY'S A WOMAN DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO PULL ANY POLITICAL PUNCHES -- OR PUNCHES, PERIOD -- BECAUSE PUNCHING WOMEN IS NOW OKAY, RIGHT TV PEOPLE?
IF A WOMAN HITS YOU, TO ME, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO HIT HER BACK.
MY WIFE IS AMERICAN INDIAN, AND SHE HAS THIS SWITCH THAT GOES OFF, AND I GO, OKAY, YOU CAN HIT ME 12 TIMES. I GO, ONE, TWO, THREE, AND THEN AFTER 12, I GO --
YOU'RE SAYING YOU HIT YOUR WIFE?
I'VE HIT MY WIFE.  I GOT BIT BY A WOMAN ON THE COLLAR BONE AND WOULDN'T LET GO. I WENT -- IT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET HER OFF! OTHERWISE, I WAS GOING TO DIE!
Stephen: HEY, YOU CAN'T BLAME BOB FOR PUNCHING A WOMAN FOR BITING HIS COLLAR BONE. I MEAN, HE'S CLEARLY DELICIOUS. ONCE SHE GOT A TASTE OF WELL-MARBLED BECKEL, THERE'S NO WAY SHE WAS GOING TO STOP! THAT MEAT IS TENDER, HE'S MARINATING IN HIS OWN SADNESS. THE POINT IS, IF WE'RE GOING TO STOP HILLARY, NOTHING IS OUT OF BOUNDS. WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY VICIOUS TO HER, BECAUSE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS RUNNING A CANDIDATE PEOPLE LIKE. JIM, WHO DO WE HAVE ON THE BENCH?
SENATOR RAND PAUL IS THE EARLY FRONTRUNNER FOR REPUBLICANS IN 2016.
MIKE HUCKABEE JUMPED TO THE HEAD OF THE PACK.
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY. CRIS CHRISTIE JEB BUSH, RICK SANTORUM, BOBBY JINDAL SENATOR MARCO RUBIO TALKING 2016
Stephen: OH, MY GOD... (LAUGHTER) WE'VE GOT TO HIT HER HARD! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
