Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  ABOUT HOW TO FIX THE HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM IT COSTS $29.95 AND A $10  COPAY. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID GOLDHILL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. GOLDHILL, THANKS SO MUCH. OKAY. SO THE NAME OF YOUR BOOK IS  "CATASTROPHIC CARE" HOW AMERICAN  HEALTH CARE KILLED MY FATHER AND HOW WE CAN FIX IT. NOW, ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
NO.
Stephen: YOU ARE NOT A  DOCTOR. YOU ARE, IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT  AND C.E.O. THE THE GAME SHOW  NETWORK.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: WHY IS THE  PRESIDENT AND C.E.O. OF THE  GAMESHOW NETWORK TRYING TO FIX OUR HEALTH CARE. AREN'T SICK PEOPLE HOME FROM  WORK YOUR CORE AUDIENCE? [LAUGHTER]
WELL, I HADN'T THOUGHT  BEFORE.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD THINK  ABOUT THAT. YOU ARE SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE  FOOT RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER]
CAN I GO ON ANYWAY. IT'S A GOOD POINT.
Stephen: SURE.
MY INTEREST ACTUALLY CAME  FROM MY FATHER'S DEATH FROM A  HOSPITAL ACQUIRED FENGS WHICH IS AN ALL-TOO COMMON EXPERIENCE BUT  BROADLY I APPROACH IT AS A  BUSINESS PERSON WITH 300 EMPLOYEES FOR WHOM HEALTH SCARE  AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. A PRNT, A PATIENT MYSELF. WHEN I SEE IS A SYSTEM BROKEN IN  SO MANY WAYS BUT THAT I THINK  ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS HAVE ONE CAUSE THAT I THINK IT HAS IN  COMMON WHICH IS WE'RE NOT THE  CUSTOMER OF THE HEALTH CARE  SYSTEM.
Stephen: WHAT? I'M THE GUY GOING THERE SAYING  GIVE ME THE DRUGS I'M SICK.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: OR I MIGHT BE  SICK. GIVE ME THE DRUGS NOW. [LAUGHTER]
THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THERE'S 310 MILLION  AMERICANS WITH A STORY ABOUT  HEALTH CARE THAT INVOLVES ANYTHING AS SIMPLE AS LOST TEST  RESULTS, UNCOORDINATED CARE,  TERRIBLE SERVICE ALL THE WAY TO THE TYPE OF HARM MY FATHER AND  OTHERS SUFFER. WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON SAY  SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T SERVE US IN  THE WAY ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE DOES YET ARGUABLY IT'S THE MOST  IMPORTANT INDUSTRY THERE IS. IT SERVES MEDICARE AND MEDICAID.
Stephen: WHO DO YOU WANT  BETWEEN ME AND MY PROVIDER, A  GOVERNMENT PANEL, A DEATH PANEL?
NO, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE  IS A GREATER ROLE FOR PATIENTS  AS CONSUMERS. SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE US  RECOGNIZE IS THAT HEALTH CARE IS  NO LONGER JUST ABOUT EMERGENCIES, GETTING HIT BY A  BUS BUT IN FACT INTEGRATED INTO  OUR LIFE IN A LOT OF WAYS.
Stephen: IT IS. I HAVE INSURANCE. SOON WE'LL HAVE OBAMA CARE. YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?
I DO.
Stephen: SOON WE'LL HAVE  MANDATED INSURANCE YOU HAVE TO  BUY INTO IT. WE'LL BE COVERED. WHAT IS IS YOUR BEEF?
WE'RE OVERINSURED.
Stephen: OVER INSURED? WHAT COULD YOU MEAN?  I WANT TO  GOOD IN AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE FOR  ANYTHING.
ABSOLUTELY AND YOU SHOULD BE  ABLE TO.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
WE HAVE INSURANCE IN A LOT OF  THINGS IN OUR SOCIETY. IF YOUR HOUSE BURNS DOWN WE  EXPECT HOMEOWNERS TO COVER US. WE DON'T EXPECT IT TO COVER US  IF OUR FURNITURE GOES OUT THE  STYLE OR PAY UTILITY BILLS.
Stephen: WHO IS THE  FURNITURE IN HEALTH CARE?
THE FURNITURE IN HEALTH CARE  IS THE FACT THAT A LOT OF HEALTH  CARE CASES ARE ROUTINE WE EXPECT TO PAY. WE KNOW WE'LL PAY. IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER HOUSES  BURNING DOWN. WE HAVE A LOT OF HEALTH CARE  ISSUES, COSTS BEYOND THE URGENT  ONES. THEY ARE A BIGGER PART OF WHAT  HEALTH CARE HAS. IT'S GREAT IF THEY COVERED THE  FURNITURE POLICY BUT IF  EVERYBODY'S FURNITURE IS COVERED IT'S A PROBLEM.
Stephen: EVERYBODY IS A  PERSON SO THEY ARE EQUAL SO THEY  SHOULD BE COVERED.
IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE  STARTING OUT TODAY.
Stephen: GAME SHOW NETWORK.
OR ANY OTHER COMPANY. WE PAY FOR YOUR INSURANCE.
Stephen: DO YOU PAY FOR IT  OR IS IT A WHEEL THEY SPIN?
WE PAY FOR IT. AN EXCELLENT IDEA THOUGH.
Stephen: YOU GOT A KIDNEY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE OVER  YOUR LIFETIME.
Stephen: YES.
SOMEWHERE AROUND $1.8 MILLION  PAID INTO THE HEALTH CARE. SO WHEN WE UNDERSTAND OUR  SYSTEM. WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS  HOW MUCH IT'S COSTING US. WE THINK IN TERMS OF BENEFITS  ISN'T IT GREAT THAT EVERYTHING  IS COVERED. WE'RE ALL PAYING FOR EACH  OTHER'S CARE, EACH OTHER'S  FURNITURE. THE PROBLEM IS AS A RESULT WE  CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S  NO INCENTIVE TO SAVE MONEY, TO CURB EXCESS CARE, TO SERVE  CUSTOMERS WELL AND NO INCENTIVE  TO CURB TRUE DANGER WHICH IS KILLING 100,000 TO 200,000 A  YEAR.
Stephen: THERE'S NO  COMPETITIVENESS BETWEEN  COMPANIES?
THERE ARE VERY FEW INSURANCE  COMPANIES LEFT. THERE'S USUALLY ONLY ONE OR TWO  BIDDING ON YOUR BUSINESS. THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE IS  PROVIDERS. WE NEED A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  WHERE SOMEBODY COULD MAKE -- A  HOSPITAL COULD MAKE MORE MONEY BY BEING A LOW PRICE LEADER OR  SAFETY LEADER. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE TODAY.
Stephen: DOESN'T HOSPITAL  WANT TO BE SAFE?
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE SAFE. THE INCENTIVES AREN'T THAT YOU  MAKE MORE MONEY BY PRACTICING  EXCESS CARE AND NOT OVERINVESTING IN SERVICE AND  SAFETY.
Stephen: AGAIN DEATH PANEL?
YOU TAKE AN IDEA FROM THE  LEFT UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND AN  IDEA FROM THE RIGHT TRYING TO BUILD A REAL MARKET AND HEALTH  CARE. YOU DO IT BY COVERING EVERYBODY  BUT NOT FOR EVERYTHING. WE REDIRECT THE ENORMOUS MONEY  BACK TO PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU GIVE EVERYBODY  THE BASIC CABLE PACKAGE NOT THE  PREMIUM CHANNELS.
ANOTHER WAY TO EXPRESS IT  MIGHT BE --
Stephen: NO MINE IS GOOD. THANK YOU MR. GOLDHILL.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
