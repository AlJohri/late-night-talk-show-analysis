Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FOUNDER OF THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM GROUP, PARENTS TRANSPARENCY PROJECT. ONE OF THEIR FIRST GOALS: SAYING "PARENTS TRANSPARENCY PROJECT" 3 TIMES FAST. PLEASE WELCOME CAMPBELL BROWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CAMPBELL GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR COMING ON. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IT HAS BEEN AWHILE.
IT AS BEEN AWHILE.
Stephen: YOU ARE A FORMER ANCHOR FOR CNN AND NBC. SINCE LEAVING TV NEWS YOU HAVE BECOME AN ADVOCATE FOR SCHOOL CHOICE AND EDUCATION REFORM. MOST RECENT PROJECT IS THE PARTNERSHIP FOR EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE WHICH FILED SUIT AGAINST THE STATE OF NEW YORK THIS WEEK CHALLENGING TEACHER TENURE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. NOW I'M NO FAN OF UNIONS, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR GUNS OUT FOR THESE PEOPLE. IS IT THE SAME REASON I AM? SO THEY CAN QUIT THEIR LAVISH LIFESTYLE OF THEIR 1983 HONDA CIVICS DRIVING AROUND TOWN?
FIRST LET ME CORRECT SOMETHING YOU SAID. WE'RE NOT FILING THE LAWSUIT. SEVEN PARENTS IN NEW YORK CITY WHO HAVE KIDS IN NEW YORK STATE WHO HAVE KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BRINGING THIS LAWSUIT.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR ROLE, JUST A BUTINSKI?
WE'RE HELPING THEM AND SUPPORTING THEM.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU SUPPORTING THEM, GIVING THEM MONEY, CASH?
NO, WE'RE HELPING THEM FIND LEGAL HELP IN ORDER TO BRING THEIR CASE.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT HELPING PAY FOR THE LEGAL HELP.
THE LEGAL HELP IS PRO BONO.
Stephen: IT'S PRO BONO. I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH. (LAUGHTER) SORRY, NO HABLA PRO BONO.
KIRKLAND & ELLIS IS THE LAW FIRM DOING THE WORK AND THEY'RE DOING IT FOR FREE, THAT MEANS FOR FREE.
Stephen: OKAY. SO YOU GOT SOME PEOPLE MAD AT YOU FOR THIS. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN BUT THERE WERE PROTESTORS OUTSIDE OF MY STUDIO TODAY.
I HEARD.
Stephen: GOING AFTER A CAMPBELL BROWN. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO UPSET THESE PEOPLE?
WELL, I MEAN THEY'RE TRYING TO SILENCE THE DEBATE, THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT DEBATE THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen:  DO THEY NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROTEST? ARE YOU SILENCING THE PROTEST.
ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUT I WANT THESE PARENTS TO HAVE A VOICE IN THIS DEBATE TOO. AND WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS CHANGE A PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM BELIEVE IS IN CRISIS AND NEEDS TO CHANGE.
Stephen: HOW IS IT CRISIS IN NEW YORK, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES, STUDENT OUTCOMES IN NEW YORK, OKAY, SO 91% OF TEACHERS AROUND THE STATE OF NEW YORK ARE RATED EITHER EFFECTIVE OR HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND YET 31%, 31% OF OUR KIDS ARE READING, WRITING AND DOING MATH AT GRADE LEVEL. HOW DOES THAT COMPUTE. HOW YOU CAN ARGUE THE STATUS QUO IS OKAY WITH NUMBERS LIKE THAT.
Stephen: I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND 31% SOUNDS LIKE A MAJORITY TO ME. OKAY. OKAY. BUT SO WHY ARE WE BLAMING-- WHY ARE WE BLAMING THE TEACHERS? MAYBE IT'S THE DUMB KIDS, YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT? KIDS ARE RATED EFFECTIVE MAYBE WE CUT THE KIDS LOOSE AND PUT THEM BACK IN THE BOBBIN FACTORY.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLAMING TEACHERS.
Stephen: BLAMING TEACHERS, SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE, THE TEACHERS UNION, HERE, AREN'T YOU.
I AM BLAMING THE TEACHER'S UNION BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE LAWS THAT ARE ANACHRONISTIC.
Stephen: AGAIN, I DON'T --
OUTDATED, ANTIQUATED.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
SO YOU KNOW, IT COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES ARE. AND IF PUBLIC EDUCATION IS ABOUT KIDS, THEN EVERY DECISION WE MAKE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE QUESTION OF IS THIS GOOD FOR A CHILD. AND THAT SHOULD BE THE DRIVING FOCUS AND THE PRIORITY, WHEN WE DECIDE WHAT OUR POLICIES SHOULD BE AND WHAT OUR LAWS SHOULD BE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THEY'RE GOING TO CLAP --
WHAT DO THEY KNOW.
Stephen: YOU ARE PLAYING THE GOOD FOR CHILD CARD. OKAY. IS THIS BASED ON CHILDREN BEING ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO EQUAL EDUCATION?
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THERE WAS A SIMILAR CASE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE PLAINTIFFS IN THAT CASE WON. AND SOME OF OUR PLAINTIFFS THE HERE TONIGHT ARE HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Stephen: YOU CAN MENTION T I WILL EDITED IT OUT BUT YOU CAN MENTION IT. THE THING IS AREN'T YOU OPENING A CAN OF WORMS THERE BECAUSE IF YOU SAY THE KIDS ARE ENTITLED TO EQUAL EDUCATION IF THAT IS YOUR ARGUMENT, DOESN'T THAT MEAN EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TO SAY EVERY CHILD IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHOULD HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON THEIR EDUCATION? RICH COMMUNITY, POOR COMMUNITY, POOL IT ALL IN, SPLIT IT ALL UP AMONG BOBBY , SUSIE AND BILLY EVERYWHERE. BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT IS EVERYONE GETS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY.
BUT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. AND I THINK-- .
Stephen: YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT'S ABOUT EQUALITY AND MONEY IS ONE OF THE EQUATIONS IN EQUALITY OR HAVE I JUST SCHOOLED YOU?
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES BROUGHT TO FIGHT THE CAUSE THAT ARE YOU BRINGING UP RIGHT NOW. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE SHOULD BE EQUALITY IN THE MONEY. I THINK WE SHOULD BE PAYING TEACHERS MORE. BUT ON TOP OF THAT WE SHOULD ALSO BE TREATING TEACHERS LIKE PROFESSIONALS, EVALUATING THEM AND TRYING TO GET AN EFFECTIVE TEACHER IN EVERY KID'S CLASSROOM. AND ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE LEAST EFFECTIVE TEACHERS ARE BEING CENTERED IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS. SO THE POOR-- .
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT WORK OUT.
SO WHAT THE TENURE LAWS DO COMBINED WITH DISMISSAL PROTECTIONS IS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIRE A TEACHER WHO IS FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT. IT TAKES ON AVERAGE 830 DAYS TO FIRE A TEACHER WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT.
Stephen: WHO GETS TO SAY WHETHER A TEACHER IS A GOOD OR BAD TEACHER. WHO GETS TO MAKE THAT CALL.
IT'S A COMBINATION OF THE PRINCIPALS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO EVALUATE.
Stephen: PARENTS COMPLAINING.
IF A LOT OF PARENTS ARE COMPLAINING, THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING TO THAT.
Stephen: WHAT IF ARE YOU SOMEPLACE WHERE THE PARENTS DON'T WANT CERTAIN THINGS TAUGHT TO THE KIDS, BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE MY KIDS NOT TO BE TAUGHT EVOLUTION. COULD I GET A TEACHER FIRED IF I BELIEVED EVOLUTION WASN'T A GOOD THING IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TENURE.
THAT IS ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE-- .
Stephen: I'M IN THE IN THE UNION.
THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE DUE PROCESS IF WE CHANGE THESE LAWS BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE. EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS AND A RIGHT TO A FAIR HEARING. IT'S VERY HARD TO ARGUE THAT A LAW THAT MAKES TEACHER LAYOFF DECISIONS OR EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS SOLELY BASED ON SENIORITY IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WHEN YOU HAVE THE TEACHER OF THE YEAR IN CALIFORNIA BEING LAID OFF AND A TEACHER WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT KEEPING THEIR JOB. WHAT DOES THAT DO TO THE KIDS? I GET THAT YOU WANT TO DEFEND TEACHERS. AND NOBODY WANTS TO ATTACK TEACHERS.
Stephen: I DON'T REALLY WANT TO DEFEND TEACHERS OR UNIONS, I MOSTLY JUST WANT TO ATTACK YOU. JUST TRYING TO WIN, CAMPBELL.
WHY.
Stephen: JUST TRYING TO WIN, ALL RIGHT. YOUR ORGANIZATION, WHERE DOES ITS MONEY COMES FROM. THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY ASKED ME TO ASK YOU.
I SAW THAT ON MY TWITTER FEED TODAY. WHO IS FUNDING THIS EFFORT?
Stephen: WHO IS FUNDING YOUR EFFORT.
KIRKLAND ELLIS, THE LAW FIRM.
Stephen: THE LAW FIRM IS FUNDING IT.
THE LAW FIRM IS DOING THIS FOR FREE SO WE HAVEN'T GONE OUT TO RAISE MONEY.
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T RAISED ANY MONEY.
I'M GOING IT TO BE RAISING LOTS OF MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BRING-- .
Stephen: AFTER THIS, THE COLBERT BUMP, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ROLLING IN IT. (APPLAUSE)
BUT WE WANT THIS TO BE, WE WANT THIS TO BE A NATIONAL EFFORT. WE WANT TO HELP PARENTS IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO WANT TO DO SIMILAR THINGS.
Stephen: SO ITS PARTNERSHIP FOR EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE HAS NOT RAISED ANY MONEY SO FAR.
YEAH, WE ARE RAISING MONEY.
Stephen: WHO DID YOU RAISE IT FROM.
I'M NOT GOING TO REVEAL THE DONORS.
Stephen: I RESPECT THAT BECAUSE I HAVE HAD A SUPER PAC.
I HEAR YOU. BUT PART OF THE REASON IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE TODAY TRYING TO PROTEST, TRYING TO SILENCE OUR PARENTS WHO WANT TO HAVE A VOICE.
Stephen: EXERCISING THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
ABSOLUTELY. BUT THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE FUNDING THIS. AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD CAUSE AND AN IMPORTANT CAUSE. AND IF SOMEONE WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAUSE WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT THEIR NAME ON IT, SO THEY BECOME A TARGET OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE EARLIER TODAY, THEN I RESPECT THAT.
Stephen: WELL, I RESPECT YOU. (LAUGHTER) I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I WOULD RESPECT AT THIS TABLE. AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT BUT YOU. CAMPBELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: CAMPBELL BROWN, PARTNERSHIP FOR EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
