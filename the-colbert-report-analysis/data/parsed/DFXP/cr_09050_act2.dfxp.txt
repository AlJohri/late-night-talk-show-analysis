[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, -- THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE TO TAKE A MINUTE RIGHT  NOW TO TALK ABOUT THE BIG STORY  TONIGHT:  MY ANGER AND  DISAPPOINTMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS SINCE THE  TERROR ATTACK ON OUR EMBASSY IN  BENGHAZI, LIBYA. AND EVERY DAY SINCE, THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE ON FOX NEWS HAVE  DEMANDED THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMAND ANSWERS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, YESTERDAY WE FINALLY HAD  THEIR CHANCE TO HOLD HILLARY  CLINTON'S FEET TO THE CAR ON  FIRE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AT HEARINGS IN THE SENATE  AND THE HOUSE INTELLEGENCE  COMMITTTEES, CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS PROVED DEFINITIVELY  THAT THEY SUCK AT THEIR JOBS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE SENATORS AND THE CONGRESS  PEOPLE WHO WERE INTERVIEWING HER  DIDN'T DRILL DOWN ON THESE  QUESTIONS.
THERE'S NO SEQUENTIAL  FOLLOW-UPS, HALF OF THE MEMBERS  ARE JUST MAKING SPEECHES.
THIS WAS TO BE IN THE EYES OF  SO MANY PEOPLE THE BIG MOMENT,  AND THESE CONGRESSIONAL INTERROGATORS DID WHAT THEY SO  OFTEN DO: THEY BLEW IT.
THE REPUBLICANS LOOKED LIKE  WEENIES.
Stephen: YES, WEENIES! [ LAUGHTER ] PINK, PLUMP AND WITH JUST LITTLE  BIT OF SPHINCTER. [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, BUT  IT WAS EMBARRASSING, ESPECIALLY  WISCONSIN SENATOR RON JOHNSON. JIM, ROLL THE FOOTAGE OF HILLARY  STOMPING RON'S JOHNSON.
NO, AGAIN, WE WERE MISLED  THAT THERE WERE SUPPOSEDLY  PROTESTS AND THAT SOMETHING SPRANG OUT OF THAT-- AN ASSAULT  SPRANG OUT OF THAT-- AND THAT  WAS EASILY ASCERTAINED THAT WAS NOT THE FACT, AND THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT  WITHIN DAYS AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW  THAT.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE  FACT IS WE HAD FOUR DEAD  AMERICANS. WAS IT BECAUSE OF A PROTEST OR  WAS IT BECAUSE OF GUYS OUT FOR A  WALK ONE NIGHT WHO DECIDED THAT THEY'D THEY GO KILL SOME  AMERICANS? WHAT DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT  DOES IT MAKE? IT IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE LESS  IMPORTANT TODAY LOOKING  BACKWARDS AS TO WHY THESE MILITANTS DECIDED THEY DID IT  THAN TO FIND THEM AND BRING THEM  TO JUSTICE, AND THEN MAYBE WE WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING  ON IN THE MEANTIME.
OKAY, THANK YOU MADAME  SECRETARY.
Stephen: "THANK YOU MADAME  SECRETARY?" [ LAUGHTER ] SHE JUST SPANKED YOU, RON! I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] UNLESS "THANK YOU MADAM  SECRETARY" YOUR SAFE WORD? [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT SHE GOT  EMOTIONAL, SLAPPED THEM AROUND,  AND WALKED OUT WITH THEIR NUTS IN HER ATTACHE CASE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THAT THEY SAY THAT ANGER  WAS ALL MADE UP.
IT WAS THEATRICS. AGAIN, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER  THE QUESTION SO SHE MAKES A BIG  SHOW OF IT.
SHE LOST HER COOL AT ONE  POINT WHICH IS PART OF THE  SCRIPT.
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR  FOUR MONTHS, SHE'S HAD A CHANCE  TO REHEARSE.
THIS ANGER, THIS OUTRAGE, I  CAN TELL YOU WAS NOT  SPONTANEOUS.
Stephen: NOW DON'T GET ME  WRONG, THESE GUYS KNOW SOMETHING  ABOUT FAKING EMOTIONS-- THEY DO IT EVERY DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I RESPECT THEM FOR IT. BUT IN THIS CASE I'M NOT BUYING  FIRST IT MAKES THE REPUBLICANS  LOOK WEAKER. NOW THEY LOST TO SOMETHING THAT  WASN'T EVEN REAL.  IF HILLARY COULD FAKE THAT KIND  OF ANGER, THAT'S SAYING THAT  EVERY WOMAN I'VE EVER ENRAGED MIGHT HAVE BEEN FAKING IT. I DON'T THINK SO, FELLAS. I'VE INFURIATED MY SHARE OF THE  LADIES OVER THE YEARS AND LET ME  TELL YOU, I GET THEM THERE,  OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] THEY ALWAYS SEEM PRETTY WORKED  UP. I CAN TELL WHEN IT'S REAL, I  MEAN, THEY'RE SCREAMING THE  WHOLE TIME. I'VE EVEN HAD NEIGHBORS  COMPLAIN. NOT TO BRAG, BUT I'VE TAKEN SOME  WOMEN TO A PLACE THAT WASN'T  EVEN HUMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY? TWO, THREE TIMES A DAY-- WHEN I  WAS YOUNGER. OF COURSE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW THAT I'M OLDER, I MOSTLY  JUST GET YELLED AT ON MY  BIRTHDAY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND YOUR  APPLAUSE AND I LIKE IT. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, THE HEARINGS WERE A  DEBACLE THAT LEFT UNANSWERED THE  ONE QUESTION THEY WERE REALLY  ABOUT. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN USE TO  STOP HILLARY IN 2016?
