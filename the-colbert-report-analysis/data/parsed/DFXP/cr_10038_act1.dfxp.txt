Stephen: THANK YOU, SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU, SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW I, I, I, I KNOW THE FEELING. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: WE HERE JUST THREE DAY AS WAY FROM OUR TWO WEEK WINTER BREAK TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. IT'S MY FAVORITE TIME OF THE YEAR OTHER THAN OUR TWO WEEK JULY BREAK TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. OH FROSTEE THE DAIQUIRI MAKES ME GIGGLE AND THEN FIGHT. I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO CHUG THIS CAR ON OF EGGNOG WHILE YOU WATCH "SANTA CLAUS 2". [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THAT IS FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT NOT ALCOHOLIC. UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, NEWS HAPPENS.
6 MONTHS AFTER EDUARD SNOWDEN REVEALED TO THE WORLD THE FEDERAL JUDGE RULED THE NSA PROGRAM THAT SWEEPS UP AMERICAN PHONE RECORDS IS LIKELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Stephen: WAY TO GO. THANKS TO YOU, THE TERRORIST KNOWS THAT NSA SPYING VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION. BY THE WAY, WHO LEAKED THAT. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: I JUST HOPE THE TERRORISTS DON'T FIND THE TREASURE MAP ON THE BACK. FOLKS, SNOWDEN'S REIGN OF INFORMATION IS ONLY GETTING STARTED. AFTER A FEW MONTHS ENJOYING THE UNLIMITED INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM OF RUSSIA HE'S READY FOR A NEW PLACE TO TAKE A LEAK.
ERIC SNOWEDEN WROTE A OPEN LETTER TO THE BRAZILIAN PEOPLE. HE SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO HELP BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATE U.S. SPYING ON THEIR SOIL BUT ONLY IF GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM.
Stephen: YA. YA, YA. THIS FACE HERE. THIS. HOW CONVENIENT, ED. JUST AS WINTER CLOSES IN ON MOSCOW YOU SUDDENLY HAVE INFORMATION THAT CAN ONLY BE LEAKED TO RIO DE JANEIRO. BRAZIL, DO NOT GIVE THIS TRAIT OR ASYLUM. INSTEAD GIVE IT TO ME. I HAVE TWO WEEKS OF ASYLUM COMING UP. I PROMISE TO ASSIST YOU IN INVESTIGATING NSA SURVEILLANCE IF YOU GRANT ME REFUGE AT THE HOTEL NANNAI AT PERNAMBUCO. DID YOU KNOW THE NSA MAY OF HIDDEN A MICROPHONE IN THE GIANT JESUS STATUE. THINK ABOUT IT THINK ABOUT IT. THEY SAY YOU SHOULDN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER. THIS IS WHY I READ EVERY PAGE OF "HITLER WAS RIGHT." I COULD OF JUST GONE WITH THE COVER ON THAT ONE. ALERT, HITLER WAS WRONG. TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: ALL CHINA EDITION. FOLKS, AS A NEWS MAN IT'S MY JOB TO DELIVER YOU UP TO THE MINUTE WEATHER EVERY EIGHT YEARS. I CALL IT WEATHER ON THE ONES. I'M ONLY DOING IT ONCE. LET'S GET TO IT. THIS WEEK'S FORECAST CALLS FOR IN DOOR TEMPS OF 6ï¿½. OUTDOOR SIGNIFICANTLY WARMER OR COLDER DEPENDING WHERE YOU LIVE. CHECK YOUR LOCAL PAPERS. THAT WAS THE WEATHER ON THE ONES. OF COURSE THE BIGGEST WEATHER NEWS IS FROM THE GREY PATCH WHERE CHINA SHOULD BE.
TAKE A LOOK AT. THIS YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH. IT'S SHANGHAI, CHINA.
HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS WERE CANCELED OR DELAYED. SCHOOLS CLOSED, RESIDENTS URGED TO STAY IN DOORS AND STABGT RAOEZ STOP PRODUCTION.
AIR QUALITY LEVELS REACH 40 TIMES THE SAFE LIFT RECOMMENDED BY THE WORLD HEALTH CORING ANYIZATION.
Stephen: FOLKS YOU CAN SEE THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA FROM SPACE BUT NOW YOU CAN'T SEE THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA FROM CHINA. IN RESPONSE CHINESE AUTHORITIES HAVE TAKEN DRASTIC ACTIONS. SHANGHAI ANNOUNCED THE POLLUTION STANDARDS WOULD LOOSEN TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF AERTS BEING ISSUED. NO, IT WORKS. IT WORKED. IT'S LIKE SETTING YOUR HOUSE ON FIRE THEN TAKING THE BATTERIES OUT OF THE SMOKE DETECTOR SO IT DOESN'T WAKE YOU UP. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A RARE TIP OF THE HAT TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THEY WENT EVEN FARTHER, FOLKS. LAST WEEK CHINA'S GOVERNMENT NEWS AGENCY INFORMED THE CHINESE PEOPLE THAT SMOG IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THEM WITH A LIST OF FIVE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN BENEFITS. SAYING IT MAKES PEOPLE MORE UNITED. IT'S A COMMON ENEMY EVERYWHERE IN CHINA. IT PROMOTES EQUALITY. BOTH OF RICH AND POOR HAVE TO INHALE THE SAME POLLUTED AIR. MAKES CHINA MORE AWARE AS A WORLD FACTORY, KNOWLEDGEABLE OF POLLUTION AND UNITES THEM. YES, LAST CERTIFICATE BEST MEDICINE ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN LAUGH WITHOUT INHALING. HA, HA, HA, HA, HA. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING]
Stephen: NEXT ON THE ALL CHINA TIP WAG, NORTH KOREA. A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN LED BY DERANGED MAD MAN. LIKE KIM IL SUNG WHO ERECTED A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND MONUMENTS IN HIS HONOR. THERE ARE MORE POSTERS FOR KIM IL SUNG IN KOREA THAN AMERICA HAS POSTERS FOR "ANCHOR MAN 2" THEN OPERATION CRAZY PANTS WAYS TAKEN OVER BY HIM SON KIM JUNG-UN WHO DEFIED THE WEST TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THEN IN 2011 HIS TINY SHOES WERE FILLED BY HIS SON KIM YUNG-UN. SOME THOUGHT UN WOULD BE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE FAMILY TYRANTSY. HE HAS SILENCED HIS DOUBTERS.
KIM YUNG-UN HAS SENTENCED HIS UNCLE TO DEATH.
WHEN KIM WAS ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL MILITARY, HIS UNCLE, ONLY CLAPPED HALF HEARTEDLY.
TRAGIC STORY. NOW WE KNOW THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING. CLEARLY -- [LAUGHING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: I'M SURE HIS REMAINING FAMILY MEMBERS ARE VERY PROUD. OR THEY SHOULD BE IF THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM. FINALLY ON THE TEE DUB I LOVE SPACE. ESPECIALLY SHOOTING STARS. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I FIRE I NEVER SEEM TO HIT ANY. I SHOULD GET A STEP LADDER. ANYWAYS, FOLKS SINISTER FORCES  ARE THREATENING AMERICA DOMINANTS.
CHINA IS THE THIRD NATION TO CARRY OUT A SOFT LANDING ON THE MOON. THE PICTURES ARE THE FIRST NEW IMAGES FROM THE MOON SURFACE IN NEARLY FOUR DECADES.
Stephen: CHINA IS ON THE MOON. I GIVE A WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE MOON. FORGIVING IT UP SO EASY. MOON, YOU BELONG TO US. HOW COULD YOU LET CHINA SOFT LAND ON YOU. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE INTO NOW. I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTO GIANT LEAPS AND DEEP IMPACT OR WERE YOU JUST FAKING IT? YES, YES WE HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND SINCE THE 1970s. YOU KNEW WE WOULD BE BACK. WE LEFT OUR CAR PARKED AT YOUR PLACE. CHINA DOESN'T LOVE YOU. THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE GOING TO THE MOON IS BECAUSE WITH THEIR POLLUTION IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SEE IT NOW.
