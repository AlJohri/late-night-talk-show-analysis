WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR OF  THE PASSAGE OF POWER ABOUT L.B.J.'S PRIZE TO THE  PRESIDENCY. I HAVEN'T FINISHED IT YET SO  NOBODY TELL ME HOW THE VIETNAM  WAR ENDS. PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT CARO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHAT AN HONOR. NOW YOU ARE THE TWO-TIME  PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING HISTORIAN  WHO IS ABOUT TO RECEIVE THE J. ANTHONY LUCAS PRIZE FOR  NONFICTION AT COLUMBIA  UNIVERSITY. CONGRATULATIONS FOR THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANKS. Stephen: I'VE GOT TO GET ME  ONE OF THOSE. NOW YOU HAVE SPENT THE LAST 40  YEARS WORKING ON YOUR... WOULD  YOU CALL IT A BIOGRAPHY OR A HISTORY OF L.B.J.?
IT'S NEITHER ITS ABOUT A MAN  BUT MOSTLY ABOUT POLITICAL  POWER. HOW THIS POLITICAL GENIUS USES  DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLITICAL  POWER LIKE THE LAST BOOK OF HOW A PRESIDENT TAKES OVER IN A TIME  OF ASSASSINATION AND BECOMES  PRESIDENT AND USES POLITICAL POWER IN AN INSTANT.
Stephen: THE ENTIRE SERIES OF  BOOKS IS CALLED THE YEARS OF  LIPPED ONJOHNSON. THE FOURTH VOLUME OUT IN  PAPERBACK RIGHT NOW IS THE  PASSAGE OF POWER. THIS IS HIM AS THE V.P.?
AS THE V.P. AND THEN ALL OF A  SUDDEN THERE'S A GUNSHOT IN  DALLAS AND HE'S P.
Stephen: OKAY. WHY LYNDON JOHNSON? WHAT FASCINATES YOU ABOUT  JOHNSON? WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SAY TO OUR  AGE NOW?
WELL, WHAT HE HAS TO SAY IS  WHAT HE SAYS TO HIS ADVISORS. AS SOON AS HE BECOMES PRESIDENT  HE HAS TO MAKE A SPEECH TO  CONGRESS. THEY SAY, "DON'T FIGHT FOR CIVIL  RIGHTS. IT'S A LOST CAUSE. YOU'LL NEVER GET IT THROUGH. IT'S A NOBLE CAUSE BUT A LOST  CAUSE. DON'T FIGHT FOR IT."  YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS? HE SAID, "WHAT THE HELL IS THE  PRESIDENCY FOR THEN?"  AND HE SETS OUT TO PASS...   ( APPLAUSE )   AND HE SETS OUT TO PASS CIVIL  RIGHTS BILLS, THE VOTING RIGHT  BILLS, MEDICATION BILL, EDUCATION BILL. HE CHANGES THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: ALL THOSE THINGS,  MEDICARE, VOTING RIGHTS, CIVIL  RIGHTS BILL, HEAD START, RIGHT? ALL THOSE THINGS -- DID THIS  BOOK START OFF AS A SERIES OF  SPOOKY STORIES TO SCARE REPUBLICANS AROUND A CAMP FIRE  AT NIGHT? BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE  THINGS THEY'D LIKE TO GET RID OF  AT THIS POINT.
YES, THEY CERTAINLY WOULD. THE THING WAS THE OTHER SIDE,  YOU KNOW, ALL THESE THINGS LIKE  HEAD START, WE THINK MAYBE THEY  FAILED. BUT THE REASON WE THINK THEY  FAILED, STEPHEN, IS THAT THEY  NEVER GOT ADEQUATELY FUNDED BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE OF LYNDON  JOHNSON WAS VIETNAM. HE ESCALATED THAT WAR UNTIL  THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR  ANYTHING ELSE.
Stephen: IN THE FOG OF WAR,  BOB McNAMARA, SECRETARY OF  DEFENSE ROBERT McNAMARA SAYS THAT KENNEDY LIKELY WOULD HAVE  DEESCALATED THAT INVOLVEMENT IN  VIETNAM. BUT WHEN JOHNSON CAME IN, THE  RECORDINGS OF HIM SAYING I KNOW  THAT YOU AND THE PRESIDENT WERE SAYING THAT YOU WERE GOING TO  DEESCALATE THAT WAR, I THINK  THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO. JOHNSON DOES THIS TO HIMSELF,  RIGHT? HE LOSES HIS FUNDING FOR HIS  PROGRAMS BY ESCALATING THE  VIETNAM WAR HIMSELF.
NOT TOTALLY DELIBERATELY BUT  THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENED
Stephen: HE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO  IT TO HIMSELF. THAT WAS JUST SORT OF A 50,000  DEAD PEOPLE OOPSY DAISY.
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF  PUTTING IT.
Stephen: VERY FEW PEOPLE  WOULD SAY THAT. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. YOU'RE VERY KIND.   ( APPLAUSE )   YOU'RE VERY KIND.
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? HE SAID THIS BITCH OF A WAR IS  KILLING THE WOMAN I LOVE, THE  GREAT SOCIETY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT  THE GREAT SOCIETY, THOSE  PROGRAMS, WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO WRITE THE NEXT BOOK  ABOUT THEM? BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDER FIRE BY  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY'RE FAILED. THE GREAT SOCIETY HAS FAILED  THIS COUNTRY.
WELL, PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE  FAILED
Stephen: I KNOW THEY'VE  FAILED.
WELL, LET ME ASK YOU A  QUESTION. DO YOU REALLY THINK A POOR KID  GROWING UP IN A HOUSING PROJECT  WITHOUT PARENTS OR WITHOUT A FATHER AND A MOTHER WHO IS  WORKING ALL DAY HAS THE SAME  CHANCE TO START IN KINDERGARTEN AS A WHITE KID, A WHITE KID  WHOSE PARENTS READ TO HIM ALL  HIS YOUTH? DOESN'T HE NEED HELP? DOESN'T HE NEED A HEAD START?   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, YOU  SAID AS A WHITE KID. OKAY. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THE  WHOLE '60s ETHOS OF LET'S HELP  PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT COLORS BECAUSE I DON'T SEE COLOR, OKAY. I'VE EVOLVED BEYOND RACISM. I'M NOT A RACIST. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE  WHITE OR BLACK. I ASSUME YOU'RE WHITE BECAUSE  YOU'VE WRITTEN FOUR VOLUMES ON  LYNDON JOHNSON. OKAY.
(LAUGHING)  Stephen: TEDDY ROOSEVELT SAID  WALK SOFTLY BUT CARRY A BIG  STICK. JOHNSON WAS KNOWN FOR HIS BIG  STICK. OKAY. WHAT DID HE... HE HAD A NICKNAME  FOR HIS PENIS, DIDN'T HE?
I WAS HOPING YOU WOULDN'T ASK  THAT.
Stephen: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE  TOLD ME. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   MR. CARO, TWO-TIME  PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR  MR. CARO WHAT WAS THE NICKNAME L.B.J. HAD FOR HIS PENIS IS.
JUMBO. HE HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR IT. WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT HE LIKED  TO URINATE OFF THE BACK PORCH OF  HIS RANCH. ONE NIGHT A SECRET SERVICEMAN  SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU WANT TO  LOOK OUT FOR RATTLE SNAKES. HE SAID RATTLE SNAKES, IT IS  PART RATTLE SNAKE.
Stephen: MR. CARO, ON THAT  HIGH NOTE... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ROBERT CARO, THE BOOK IS THE  PASSAGE OF POWER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
