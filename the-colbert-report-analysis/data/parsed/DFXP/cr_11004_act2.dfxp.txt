Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELCOME BACK. NATION, I GOTTA TELL YOU-- AND I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S NECESSARILY ANY KIND OF NEWS FLASH RIGHT NOW, BUT BEING RICH IS GREAT. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS SOMETIMES YOU ENCOUNTER PEOPLE WHO HAVE LESS MONEY THAN YOU HAVE. AND WHAT WE RICH PEOPLE WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS TO FEEL SEPARATE IN OUR EXCLUSIVENESS. THIS IS A STATE KNOWN ADD SOLITOCITY. IT'S A SECRET WORD THAT ONLY RICH PEOPLE USE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ON THE SPECIAL S.A.T. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE BECAUSE THE COLLEGE HAS A BUILDING NAMED AFTER US. THIS NEED FOR EXCLUSIVITY IS WHY WE HAVE OUR OWN PRIVATE JETS, OUR OWN PRIVATE ISLANDS, EVEN OUR OWN PRIVATE PARTS. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IMAGINE GOING THROUGH LIFE WITH ONLY ONE SET OF GENITALS. I PITY YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) WE NEED TO BE AWAY FROM YOU NORMALS WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO INSPIRED BY AN INNOVATION IN EXCLUSIVITY PIONEERED BY VINOD HOSLA, A SILICON VALLEY ZILLIONAIRE AND BARACK OBAMA VINDALOO. KHOSLA OWNS 53 ACRES OF BEACH FRONT PROPERTY ON THE PACIFIC COAST BUT BECAUSE OF SOME DUMB RULE THAT YOU CAN'T BUY THE OCEAN, THE UNWASHED MASSES KEPT UP-WASHING ON HIS BEACH NEAR HIS PROPERTY AND HE TOOK ACTION.
KHOSLA GAINED CONTROL TO THE ONLY ROAD TO THE BEACH, BUILT A GATE, AND CALLED THE COPS. FAMILIES WHO HAD FLOCKED HERE FOR GENERATIONS WERE SUDDENLY SHUT OUT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- YOU CAN'T BUY HAPPENNESS, BUT KHOSLA PROVED YOU CAN BUY OTHER PEOPLE'S SADNESS. UNFORTUNATELY, KHOSLA'S PLAN HIT A BUMP IN THE ROADBLOCK.
THE JUDGE HAS RULED AGAINST A BILLIONAIRE WHO CLOSED OFF ACCESS TO MARTINS BEACH, EVEN THOUGH KHOSLA OWNS THE 53-ACRE BEACHFRONT PROPERTY, THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA COAST BELOW THE HIGH TIDE LINE IS ACTUALLY PUBLIC PROPERTY.
Stephen: KHOSLA IS A TREND-SETTER AND OTHER OPULENT AMERICANS ARE ALREADY FOLLOWING IN HIS FOOTSTEPS ON THE BEACH. THIS TIME THERE'S ONLY ONE SET IN THE SAND. BECAUSE JESUS COULDN'T GET PAST THE GATES. ( LAUGHTER ) JIM.
THAT HASN'T STOPPED OTHER BEACHED FRONT HOME OWNERS FROM INSTALLING FAKE "NO PARKING" SIGNS, HIDING ACCESS POINTS AND DISGUISING SOME CURBS AS FIRE LANES.
Stephen: YES, THEY'RE KEEPING THE PUBLIC AWAY WITH FAKE FIRE LANES IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE WHICH, AS A BONUS, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAN USE TO PARK THEIR TRUCKS WHEN AN ANGRY MOB SETS FIRE TO THEIR HOUSE. BUT BEST OF ALL-- ( APPLAUSE ) BEST OF ALL OF THESE GUYS-- ( APPLAUSE ) BEST OF ALL IS CALIFORNIA MEDIA MOGUL DAVID GEFFEN WHO IS EVIDENTLY TIRED OF BEACHGOERS PARKING NEAR HIS HOUSE AND HE FOUND AN INGENIOUS NEW WAY TO TELL THEM TO GEFF OFF MY LAWN.
THESE ARE DESIGNED TO LOOK LIKE GARAGE DOORS BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY GARAGE DOORS. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN'T PARK HERE, BUT IF YOU LOOK REALLY, REALLY CLOSELY, THESE ARE ACTUALLY SEALED SHUT.
Stephen: YES, THESE FAKE GARAGE DOORS ARE KEEPING BEACHGOERS AWAY AND IF HE PAINT A TUNNEL ON THEM HE CAN FINALLY DEFEAT THAT COYOTE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, I APPLAUD-- YOU APPLAUD AND I APPLAUD THESE TRAILBLAZERS BECAUSE AS A WEALTH-AMERICAN, I TOO SUFFER THE INDIGNITY OF SHARING THE WORLD WITH OTHERS. IT'S SO DISTASTEFUL DRIVING ON THE SAME ROAD WITH THE NORMALLY MONIED. NOW I DRIVE WHEREVER I WANT BECAUSE I HAVE A YIELD SIGN ATTACHED TO MY FRONT BUMPER. BUT ONCE I GET WHERE I'M GOING, I STILL WANT THE PRIVACY. THAT'S WHY NOW I ALWAYS TRAVEL WITH MY OWN VELVET-ROPED  V.I.P. SECTION. YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS-- THIS CREATES AN INPENETRABLE ZONE OF SOLITOCITY AROUND MY NECK. NOW NOT ONLY AM I LIVING IN THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM, BUT IT COMES WITH A GETAWAY STRAP SO AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I CAN ESCAPE THE RABBLE. I JUST USE MY REMOTE CONTROL, AND THEN ONCE THE STRAP DESCENDS I MERELY ATTACH THE STRAP TO THIS, AND IF I RUN INTO ANY HOI POLLOI, I MERELY WHISK MYSELF AWAY TO A RESORT  SO EXCLUSIVE NO ONE HAS EVER RETURNED. JIMMY! JIMMY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
