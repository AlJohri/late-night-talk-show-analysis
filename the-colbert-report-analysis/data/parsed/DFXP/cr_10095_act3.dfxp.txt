Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA. OR CRIMEA. IT'S HARD TO TELL AT THIS POINT. PLEASE WELCOME AMBASSADOR MICHAEL McFAUL. (APPLAUSE) MR. AMBASSADOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. NOW AMBASSADOR THAT SAY GREAT TITLE. YOU GET TO HOLD ON TO THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AMBASSADOR ANY MORE?
TECHNICALLY BUT NOW I'M PROFESSOR.
Stephen: YOUR EXCELLENCY.
IF YOU WANT TO CALL ME THAT, THAT WOULD BE HAPPY.
Stephen: THAT IS REALLY NICE. I WOULD HAVE CARDS PRINTED UP. OKAY. NOW AS I SAID YOU WERE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA. AN ARCHITECT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RESET POLICY THERE. I HEAR THAT TERM A LOT. WHAT DOES RESET MEAN? BECAUSE WE SEEM LIKE WE'RE RESET TO THE COLD WAR WITH RUSSIA.
WHICH I'M IN FAVOR OF, WHAT WAS THE INTENTION OF OUR RESET WITH RUSSIA?
WELL BACK IN 2009 WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA USED THAT TERM THE FIRST TIME, THE IDEA WAS VERY SIMPLE. THAT WE HAVE SOME COMMON INTEREST WITH RUSSIA. AND IF WE ENGAGE WITH THEM IF WE TALK TO THEM WE CAN ACHIEVE THOSE OUTCOMES SO GETTING RID OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, SANCTIONS ON IRAN, SUPPLYING OUR TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN THROUGH RUSSIA OR INCREASING TRADE AND INVESTMENT, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID.
WE GOT THOSE.
WE GOT THOSE.
WHERE DO THING GOES SOUTH HERE? IS IT WHEN WE DIDN'T AGREE WITH THEM OVER THE GAYS? THAT WHAT IT WAS? BECAUSE REMEMBER THOSE DAYS WHEN THE ONLY THING WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WHOLE HE DOESN'T LIKE GAYS PEOPLE. I'M NOSTALGIC FOR THAT AT THIS POINT.
I'M NOT. WELL, IT HAD TO DO WITH THAT. BECAUSE THE RESET WAS WITH PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV.
Stephen: THE SHORT GUY.
THE SHORT GUY, NEITHER IS VERY BIG BUT THE OTHER GUY.
Stephen: PUTIN SEEMS TALL, RIGHT?
THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME SIZE. BUT WHEN PRESIDENT PUTIN CAME IN, HE CHANGED THE TONE AND THEN LATER THE POLICY. I THINK IT REALLY HAD TO DO WITH THE CHANGE.
Stephen: AS AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA, HOW MANY YEARS.
TWO YEARS.
Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW THEY DIDN'T TURN YOU? LET ME JUST ASK YOU THIS, LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU, THE SQUIRREL IS IN THE BASKET. DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU.
NOTHING AT ALL.
Stephen: GOOD CAUSE --
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING THAT IS NOT A CODE WORD AT ALL. ALL RIGHT. WAS THERE A MOMENT --
THEY.
IF THEY WERE TRYING TO RECRUIT ME, I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A LITTLE BIT BETTER TREATMENT.
Stephen: WAS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE THERE YOU DON'T THINK YOU WERE UNDER SURVEILLANCE.
THAT I WAS NOT?
Stephen: YEAH.
NO, ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: PUTIN SAW YOU AS A PERSONAL ENEMY.
YEAH, HE DID.
Stephen: HE THOUGHT YOU WERE BEHIND THE 2011 PROTEST AGAINST HIS REGIME.
THAT'S RIGHT. I MEAN NOT JUST ME, THE PRESIDENT OBAMA, UNITED STATES, THE WEST.
Stephen: BUT HE DIDN'T LIKE YOU PARTICULARLY.
YEAH, HE DIDN'T LIKE ME, THAT'S RIGHT. HE DIDN'T. IN FACT, HE TOLD ME ONCE OR TWICE.
Stephen: OH REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT DID HE SAY?
JUST WHAT YOU SAID, THAT HE SAID I THINK YOU'RE SUPPORTING THE OPPOSITION AGAINST ME.
Stephen: WERE YOU, WERE YOU DOING THAT?
NO I WASN'T, I MEAN-- I MEAN I MET WITH EVERYBODY. I ENGAGED AS A DIPLOMAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.
Stephen: ARE YOU A MEMBER OF PUSSY RIOT IS WHAT I'M ASKING? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M NOT A MEMBER.
Stephen: OKAY.
THOUGH I HAVE MET WITH THEM.
Stephen: ME TOO.
SOON AFTER THEY WERE ON YOUR SHOW. THEY LIKED YOU A LOT.
Stephen: DID THEY LIKE YOU?
I DON'T KNOW I THINK THEY HAD MORE FUN WITH YOU.
Stephen: I WILL PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.
OKAY.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW THAT WE HAVE SORT OF HIT THE RESET BUTTON, THINGS ARE ROUGH BETWEEN US AND RUSSIA AGAIN DO WE HIT THE RESET BUTTON AGAIN OR DO WE TAKE THE CARTRIDGE OUT OF THE CONSOLE AND BLOW ON IT A FEW TIMES BEFORE WE PUT IT BACK IN? HOW DO WE GET BACK TO A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON.
Stephen: REALLY?
THERE IS NOT ANOTHER-- I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND ANOTHER RESET BUTTON BECAUSE PUTIN DECIDED HE DOESN'T WANT TO COOPERATE WITH US. HE DOESN'T WANT THESE WIN-WIN OUTCOMES THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT. AND HE IS ON A DIFFERENT COURSE.
Stephen: SEEMS WIN-WIN FOR HIM. HE IS EATING OUR LUNCH OVER THERE. WHY WON'T WE PUT TROOPS IN CRIMEA.
YOU WANT TROOPS IN CRIMEA.
Stephen: WHAT IS WRONG WITH HAVING A LAND WAR IN ASIA?
Stephen: WHEN DID THAT EVER GO WRONG? (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT AND THEREFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA I THINK RIGHTLY IS TRYING TO CHANGE PUTIN'S CALCULUS, USING DIFFERENT WAYS, IN PARTICULAR ECONOMIC SANCTION, MAYBE IN THE SHORT RUN THAT MAKES PUTIN POPULAR. IT HAS, HE IS AT 80%, I OBAMA IS AT 43.
Stephen: MAYBE OBAMA SHOULD INVADE SASKATCHEWAN, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WISE BUT I DON'T DO DOMESTIC POLITICS. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO LAST BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN THIS SYSTEM THAT PUTIN SET UP, THIS AUTOCRATIC REGIME, I THINK WILL RUN ITS COURSE AND IF THE ECONOMY BEGINS TO TANK HIS SUPPORT WILL ALSO FALL.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY MECHANISM INSIDE RUSSIA TO STOP HIM OR DOES HE HAVE COMPLETE POWER.
HE HAS COMPLETE-- NOT TOTAL POWER. THERE IS A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR MONEY BECAUSE OF THE ADVENTURES IN UKRAINE BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IF RUSSIA WERE MORE DEMOCRATIC, IF THERE WERE A CONGRESS IF THERE WERE OPPOSITION PARTIES, IF THERE WERE A SHOW LIKE YOURS IN RUSSIA THAT WOULD BE CRITICISM-- CRITICIZING PRESIDENT PUTIN THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE COSTLY FOR HIM. RIGHT NOW HE DOESN'T HAVE THOSE KIND OF CONTROLS ON HIS POWER.
Stephen: IF THERE WAS A SHOW LIKE MINE IN RUSSIA I WOULD LET SOMEONE ELSE START MY CAR. YOUR EXCELLENCY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AMBASSADOR MICHAEL McFAUL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
