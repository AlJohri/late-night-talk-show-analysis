WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF COSMOS, VIEWED IN 45 LANGUAGES, 171 COUNTRIES BUT ONLY ONE UNIVERSE, PLEASE WELCOME NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. NEIL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. WELL, WELL, WELL.
I LOVE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH THE PLACE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS IS A LIVE FEED FROM THE UNIVERSE.
THIS IS FROM THE COSMOS RIGHT NOW.
EVERY SIGHT LINE WE HAVE IS LIVE FEED FROM THE UNIVERSE.
Stephen: DON'T BLOW MY MIND YET, OKAY. WE HAVE THE WHOLE SHOW TO DO IT HERE. YOU CAN'T BLOW MY MIND IN THE FIRST TEN SECONDS, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU, IT'S BEEN AWHILE.
Stephen: THIS IS YOUR TENTH TIME ON THE SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO GUEST HAS BEEN ON AS MANY TIMES. I KNEW YOU BEFORE YOU WERE A GLOBAL SUPERSTAR, ALL RIGHT. I GET MY BEAK WET ON THIS ONE, YOU OWE ME A LITTLE SOMETHING ON THIS ONE. NOW FOR THE FEW PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AROUND THE GLOBE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, DIRECTOR OF THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM, MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN NEW YORK. WROTE TEN BOOK, RECEIVED THE NASA DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE MEDAL AND HOST OF COSMOS, SPACE TIME ODYSSEY WHICH PREMIERED LAST NIGHT ON FOX.
I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: THIS IS SPACE TIME, SPACE TIME RIGHT HERE. (APPLAUSE) NOW WE ALL WATCHED SHOW WHEN WE WERE KIDS WITH CARL SAGAN, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO STEP INTO HIS TURTLENECK? (LAUGHTER) YOU KNEW SAGAN.
I HAVE A LITTLE ONE HERE, A LITTLE HOMAGE.
Stephen: AMERICANS NEVER GOT TO SEE SAGAN'S NECK. WE NEVER KNEW WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE. WHAT IS IT LIKE STEPPING INTO HIS SHOE, DID YOU KNOW HIM?
WE MET WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS A 17-YEAR-OLD KID, BORN IN THE BRONX WHERE I'M FROM. AND I-- BRONX IN THE HOUSE. SO I, MY APPLICATION TO COLLEGES WERE DRIPPING WITH THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE I HAD KNOWN I HAD WANTED TO DO THIS SINCE I WAS NINE, I HAD AN ANSWER FOR ALL THOSE ADULTS THAT ASK THE ANNOYING QUESTION, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP. BY THE TIME I WAS 11 I SAID ASTROPHYSICIST AND THEY WOULD JUST WALK AWAY. THEY QUICKLY ENDED THAT CONVERSATION. SO UNKNOWN TO ME, THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE AT CORNELL FORWARDED MY APPLICATION TO CARL SAGAN FOR HIM TO REACT. AND HE THEN SENT ME A PERSONAL LETTER, THERE IT WAS, CARL-- HE HAD ALREADY BEEN ON THE TONIGHT SHOW, BEST SELLING BOOKS, ALREADY FAMOUS AND HE INVITED ME TO CORNELL TO HELP ME DECIDE WHETHER I WOULD CHOOSE CORNELL FOR MY COLLEGE. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S NOT EVEN IT. I WENT UP, I WENT TO CORNELL, HE GREETED ME OUTSIDE. AND WE WENT INTO HIS OFFICE, HE REACHED BACK, DIDN'T EVEN LOOK, PULLED OUT ONE OF HIS BOOKS, SIGNED IT TO ME, I STILL HAVE THAT BOOK. AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST COOL. HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK WHICH BOOK HE WAS PULLING OUT AND HE WROTE THE BOOK, RIGHT. SO, SO THEN HE TOOK ME BACK TO THE CORNELL, ITHACA, NEW YORK, STARTED SNOWING AS IT ALWAYS DOES.
Stephen: ALL THROUGH SUMMER.
AND HE WAS WORRIED THAT THE BUS WOULDN'T GET THROUGH AND HE WROTE DOWN HIS HOME PHONE NUMBER. HE SAID IF THE BUS DOESN'T COME THROUGH, CALL ME. SPEND THE NIGHT WITH MY FAMILY, LEAVE TOMORROW. AND I SAID WHO AM I TO HIM. AND SO I REALIZED, THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOR FOR SOMEONE WHO IS FAMOUS. AND I SAID IF I AM EVER REMOTELY THAT FAMOUS I'M GOING TO TREAT STUDENTS THE WAY HE TREATED ME SO IT AFFECTED ME THE REST OF MY LIFE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO SAY FOR THE RECORD, IF THERE ANY STUDENTS OUT THERE WHO GET CAUGHT IN A SNOWSTORM, YOU MAY NOT STAY WITH ME. (LAUGHTER) LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT COSMOS.
THE COSMIC CALENDAR BEGINS ON JANUARY 1st, WITH THE BIRTH OF OUR UNIVERSE. DID CONTAINS EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN UP TO NOW, WHICH ON THIS CALENDAR IS MIDNIGHT DECEMBER 31st. ON THIS SCALE, EVERY MONTH REPRESENTS ABOUT A BILLION YEARS. EVERY DAY, REPRESENTS NEARLY 40 MILLION YEARS. LET'S GO BACK AS FAR AS WE CAN TO THE VERY FIRST MOMENT IN THE UNIVERSE. JANUARY 1st. THE BIG BANG. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S AS FAR BACK AS WE CAN SEE IN TIME. FOR NOW.
Stephen: NOW HOW MUCH SUNSCREEN DID YOU HAVE TO PUT ON BEFORE THEY EXPLODED.
THE FLAME PROOF SUIT.
Stephen: HERE'S WHAT BUGS ME, OKAY, YOU SAY IN THAT LITTLE THING THAT ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY IS THE LAST 14 SECONDS.
ALL WRITTEN HUMAN HISTORY.
Stephen: IN THE LAST 14 SECONDS OF THE CALENDAR YEAR, HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ANYTHING HAPPENED BEFORE THOSE 14 SECONDS IF IT WASN'T WRITTEN DOWN? AREN'T YOU SCIENTISTS JUST GUESSING ALL THAT STUFF? LIKE THE BIG BANG, LIKE ALL OF THE REST OF THAT COSMIC CALENDAR YEAR, ISN'T THAT KIND OF JUST A GUESSTIMICATION?
NO.
Stephen: NO?
WE NEED WRITTEN HISTORY TO SEE WHO LIVES AND WHAT THEY DID AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHO WAS KING AND QUEEN AND --
HOW MUCH GRAIN THERE WAS.
THAT IS WHAT THEIR WRITTEN STUFF, WE DON'T NEED THE WRITTEN STUFF TO TELL US ABOUT THE GEOLOGY OR ASTRO PHYSICS, IT'S JUST TO GET HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON THE MAP. OTHERWISE, LEAVE IT OUT. I WILL TELL YOU-- WHERE THE RIVERS FLOWED, WHERE THE SEDIMENTS WERE LAID. WHERE THE-- WE GOT THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M JUST SAYING.
Stephen: IN LAST NIGHT'S SHOW, I'M-- YOU ALSO TOOK A COUPLE OF POTSHOTS AT MY CATHOLIC CHURCH. YOU MADE THE SLANDEROUS ACCUSATION THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SCIENTISTS AN PEOPLE WITHOUT DID NOT AGREE WITH THE CHURCH WHERE. DID YOU GET THESE ACCUSATIONS OTHER THAN FROM HISTORY BOOKS?
IN FACT, THE PEOPLE WHO PUT GEEDONEO BRUNO TO DEATH WHO WAS OUR HERO OF THAT STORY, WAS NOT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH T WAS THE ROMAN AUTHORITIES AND WE SAY THAT.
OH REALLY.
YEAH. SO-- WITH.
SO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS BEEN GOOD FOR SCIENCE. I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.
TECHNICALLY THEIR HANDS ARE CLEAN OF HIS DEATH BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T BURN HIM AT THE STAKE, THE ROMAN AUTHORITIES BURNED HIM AT THE STAKE, TECHNICALLY BUT THEY WERE EXECUTING THE-- I MEAN THAT WAS THE PUNISHMENT.
Stephen: THEY WERE JUST OBEYING ORDERS.
SO, SO THE POINT IS WE MADE IT CLEAR, IT WAS THE INQUISITION THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE HERE. SO THAT'S A PIECE OF WHAT WAS THEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND IT IS A PIECE THAT IS NO LONGER.
Stephen: OKAY. SO YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF BEING BURNED AT THE STAKE FOR THIS SHOW.
NO.
Stephen: SO IF YOU HAVE THE COURAGE STICK AROUND BECAUSE I'VE GOT SOME KINDLING TO PUT AT YOUR FEET WHEN WE COME BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
