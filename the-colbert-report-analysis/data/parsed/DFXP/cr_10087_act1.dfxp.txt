Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE ON-- NICE TO BE HERE ON SUCH A SPECIAL NIGHT. I JUST HAD A NEW CHILD. AND IT'S THE EASIEST BIRTH I'VE EVER HAD. WELCOME TO THE FAMILY, AVERY. NATION, WE ARE JUST--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, WE ARE JUST 100 DAYS AWAY FROM BEING 845 DAYS AWAY FROM THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND THE GOP FIELD IS ALREADY FULL OF STRONG CONTENDERS FORMING COMMITTEES TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF TALKING TO THEIR FAMILIES ABOUT MAYBE VACATIONING IN IOWA THIS YEAR. (LAUGHTER) THE CANDIDATE I'VE BEEN PINNING MY HOPES ON IS JEB BUSH, HE'S A STRONG LEADER WHOSE VICTORY WOULD RETURN DIGNITY TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND RELEVANCE TO MY TRAMP STAMP. SADLY THIS PAST WEEKEND JEB SHOT HIMSELF IN THE FOOT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A RINGING ENDORSEMENT OF GUN RIGHTS IF HE HADN'T ALSO SAID THIS ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
THEY CROSS THE BORDER BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER MEANS TO WORK, TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY. YES, THEY BROKE THE LAW, BUT IT'S NOT A FELONY. IT'S KIND OF-- IT'S AN ACT OF LOVE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HE WILL BE MISSED. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS KNOW THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS NOT AN ACT OF LOVE, SIR. IT IS ILLICIT FILTHY ACT OF BORDER PENETRATION. NO LOVE INVOLVED. IT IS SWEATY AND IT IS FRANTIC. AND ODDS ARE IT IS HAPPENING IN THE BACK OF A TRUCK. (LAUGHTER) THE ONLY LOVE GOING ON HERE IS THE IMMIGRANT'S LOVE FOR AMERICAN JOBS EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. I SAY IF IMMIGRANTS LOVED THEIR FAMILIES SO MUCH THEN WHY DOES MY HOUSEKEEPER NEVER SEEM TO GO HOME TO HER KIDS. SHE'S ALWAYS WITH MINE. BY THE WAY, ROSITA, I NEED YOU TO STAY LATE TONIGHT. DON'T GET ME WRONG, FOLKS, IMMIGRATION IS WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. BUT ONLY WHEN IT'S THE RESULT OF NAZIS, POTATO FAMINE OR HOWEVER BLACK PEOPLE GOT HERE. I DON'T KNOW. NICE TRY, JEB, IT'S OVER. NATION, I NEVER BOW IN THE FACE OF CRITICISM, I AM THE FACE OF CRITICISM. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, I KNOW YOU DO, I KNOW THAT I DON'T TRUST "THE NEW YORK TIMES", EXCEPT THE WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS. IT IS THE FINAL CONFIRMATION OF WHAT THE COUPLE'S INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND SAVE THE DATE ONLY HINTED AT. AND NOW THE ANNOUNCEMENT PAGE GOT EVEN ANNOUNCIER. BECAUSE SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN ALL THE NOTICES OF MARRIAGE THEY RECENTLY INTRODUCED A NEW COLUMN CALLED UNHITCHED WHICH SHARES STORIES OF DIVORCE. IT IS SWEET, ISN'T IT? (LAUGHTER) THE MOST RECENT COLUMN FEATURED JOHN AND PATTY REID WHO GOT MARRIED IN THE '80s BUT BEGAN DRIFTING APART. JOHN LAMENTS OUR LOVE WANT STRONG ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS BETWEEN US. APPARENTLY JOHN MET A WOMAN. AT FIRST THE RELATIONSHIP WAS BUSINESS-RELATED BUT IT BECAME ROMANTIC. THAT'S A NICE CLIPPING FOR THE SCRAPBOOK FOR TWO OF THE THREE PEOPLE INVOLVED. (LAUGHTER) SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES"S FOR KEEPING IT REAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW QUICK MESSAGE, QUICK MESSAGE TO THE NEWLY-WEDS WHOSE NUPTIALS WERE FEATURED IN THE TIMES. THE BAD NEWS IS STATISTICALLY HALF OF YOUR MARRIAGES WILL END IN DIVORCE. THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU WILL HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO BE PROFILED BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES". BUT ONE OCCASIONAL STORY IN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE IS NOT ENOUGH THERE SHOULD BE AN ENTIRE SECTION OF DIVORCE ANNOUNCEMENTS, BRAD BERNSTEIN AND JENNIFER CHEN WERE DIVORCED FRIDAY IN AN UNCIVIL CEREMONY AT THE LAW OFFICES OF WERNER AND GLUCK CHAN'S FATHER SAID QUOTE THANK GOD THERE WERE NO CHILDREN. AND FOR THAT MATTER, FOR THAT MATTER, WHY ARE NEWLY-WEDS AND THE DIVORCED HOGGING ALL THE LIMELIGHT. WHAT ABOUT CELEBRATING THE MILLIONS OF MARRIED COUPLES WHO ARE SIMPLY MAKING IT WORK BY PRINTING STILL MARRIED ANNOUNCEMENTS. MARK HEFNER AND HIS WIFE MARIE ARE PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THEY CONTINUE TO BE MARRIED. ARE THEY ALWAYS HAPPY, NO. IS IT WORK WITH KIDS, YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS. MARIE HAS A FULL-TIME JOB TOO SO WHY IS HE IS THE ONE TAKING THE KIDS TO SOCCER PRACTICE, OH, HERE WE GO, GET OUT THE CHALK AND THE BLACKBOARD BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I'M JUST TIRED. ANYWAY MARK AND MARIE BASICALLY ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANIES AND ISN'T THAT THE MOST YOU CAN HOPE FOR? (APPLAUSE)
GET ON IT, "NEW YORK TIMES". I WANT THIS, I WANT THIS STILL MARRIED ANNOUNCEMENT TO BE PRINTED FOR THE SAME REASON ALL MARRIAGE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE PRINTED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW JEALOUS. NEXT UP, FOLKS, I LOVE HUNTING. PARTLY IT'S THE THRILL OF STALKING PREY BUT MOSTLY IT'S THE LOVE OF ALCOHOL AND PUBLIC URINATION. AND I LOVE EVERY INNOVATION IN HUNTING WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE ALASKA BOARD OF GAME WHICH JUST VOTED TO  MAKE-- ASSISTED HUNTING ILLEGAL BY BANNING USING A DRONE TO FLY ABOVE TREES TO LOOK FOR A MOOSE OR A BEAR. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, GO INTO THE WOODS MYSELF. THERE MIGHT BE A MOOSE OR A BEAR IN THERE! (LAUGHTER) AND LISTEN, JUST LISTEN TO THEIR LAME REASON.
ALASKA'S BOARD OF GAME SAYS DRONES GIVE HUNTERS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.
Stephen: SINCE WHEN IS HUNTING ABOUT FAIRNESS? IF IT WAS FAIR, WE WOULD MEET THE MOOSE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD, FLIP A COIN AND THE WINNER GETS THE GUN. SO LIFT THIS BAN, ALASKA, AND ALLOW AMERICANS TO FULFILL THE DREAM OF EVERY OUTDOORSMAN BAGGING A  MAJESTIC 12 POINT BUCK FROM THE COMFORT OF HIS OWN TOILET. FINALLY, ON TIPPY KI-YAY MOTHER WAGGER A NEW WARNING HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED ABOUT A CAR WITH 16 VALVES, FOUR CYLINDERS AND THOUSANDS OF LITTLE LEGS.
MAZDA IS RECALLING 42,000 CARS BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL DANGER CAUSED BY SPIDERS. THE AUTOMAKER SAYS THE INSECTS ARE DRAWN BY THE SMELL OF GASOLINE AND THEN THEY BUILD WEBS INSIDE THE VENT HOSE. THAT CAUSES THE FUEL TANK TO CRACK, INCREASING THE RISK OF FUEL LEAKS AND FIRES.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. ONCE AGAIN, MANKIND FACES A THREAT OF GAS HUFFING SPIDERS. (LAUGHTER) WHICH BRINGS ME TO A TIP OF THE HAT TO MAZDA WHOSE HANDLING OF THIS ISSUE IS AS SMOOTH AS THE HANDLING OF THE MAZDA 6-4 SEDAN, MAZDA, IT'S GOT SPIDERS IN IT. NOW MAZDA-- QUICK TO EXPLAIN--  (APPLAUSE)
MAZDA QUICKLY EXPLAINED THAT NO INJURIES OR FIRES HAVE BEEN REPORTED DUE TO THE ISSUE. AND YOU CAN TRUST MAZDA AS EXPERTS ON THE SPIDER ISSUE BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD PLENTY OF PRACTICE. BACK IN 2011 MAZDA RECALLED CARS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, A CAR FULL OF SPIDERS ONCE, SHAME ON YOU. CAR FULL OF SPIDERS TWICE, OH GOD, THE SPIDERS ARE BACK. NOW AT THIS POINT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AT THIS POINT WHEN YOU BUY A MAZDA, SPIDERS ARE JUST A DEALER OPTION. SO YOU WANT AN UNDERCOATING? NO, HOW ABOUT THE SPIDERS, NO? OKAY, I CAN REMOVE THE SPIDERS FOR $500 BUT I WILL HAVE TO ASK MY MANAGER FIRST. NOW IF YOU ARE A MAZDA OWNER AFFECTED BY THIS RECALL, DO NOT WORRY BECAUSE MAZDA WILL UPDATE YOUR CAR'S SOFTWARE FOR FREE TO INSURANCE THAT THE FUEL TANK PRESSURE DOESN'T BUILD UP. YES, YOU STILL HAVE THE SPIDERS, BUT NOW YOU CAN USE THE HOV LANE.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
