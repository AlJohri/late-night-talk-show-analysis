Stephen: HEY! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WOW! RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. FOLKS, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO ME RIGHT NOW, YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE JOSHUA AN WE'RE GOING TO TEAR DOWN THE WALLS OF INJURY COTONIGHT. NOW NATION, IT IS DAY THREE OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND IT IS A CRITICAL MOMENT IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE YOGURT LEFT BY FURLOUGHED FEDERAL WORKERS ARE PASSING THEIR EXPIRATION DATE. NOW IT'S ALSO BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT INVITED CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS FROM BOTH SIDES TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SPEAKER BOEHNER JUST CAME OUT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A RELATIVELY LONG MEETING, OVER AN HOUR, AND BASICALLY SAID THERE WAS NO PROGRESS.
BOTH SIDES EMERGING WITH NO DEAL AND NO SIGNS OF PROGRESS.
NO PROGRESS BY ALL ACCOUNTS. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY AGREED ON.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE ONLY THING THEY'VE ACTUALLY AGREED ON WAS THAT THEY MADE NO PROGRESS. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT AGREEMENT IS ITSELF PROGRESS. SO THE ONLY THING THEY AGREED ON WAS WRONG AND NOW WE ARE HE BACK TO SQUARE ONE. NOW FOLKS, REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN. THEY WANT TO END THIS STALEMATE AND GET BACK TO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF CRIPPLING THE GOVERNMENT. (LAUGHTER) BUT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA REFUSES TO COMPROMISE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN WILLING TO NEGOTIATE AND I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE.
I SAID THIS BEFORE. I'M GOING TO REPEAT IT. THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATIONS OVER THIS. LET ME REPEAT. I WILL NOT NEGOTIATE-- .
Stephen: HE WILL NOT NEGOTIATE? WHEN DID THAT START? EVIDENTLY, OBAMACARE COVERED BALL TRANSPLANTS. SO THE TWO PARTIES ARE AT A STALEMATE BUT LUCKILY THE GOP HAS ONE OF THE STALEST MATES OF ALL, INDIANA CONGRESSMAN MAR LONG CONSTITUTESMAN. HE TOLD THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER, QUOTE, WE'RE TO THE GOING TO BE DISRESPECTED. WE HAVE TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS. (LAUGHTER) THERE YOU HAVE IT, MR. PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A CLEAR SIGNAL OF WHAT OBAMA NEEDS TO OFFER. SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER) JUST TELL REPUBLICANS IF THEY AGREE TO END THIS IMPASSE THEY CAN GET WHATEVER IS IN THIS SECRET MYSTERY BOX. I MEAN, WHAT COULD IT BE? THE COMPLETE DISMANTLING OF OBAMACARE, THE KEYSTONE XL PIPE-LINE OR IS IT A LOVELY DINETTE SET QURT SEE OF PROVIDEHILL. ACT NOW, REPUBLICANS AND THE PRESIDENT WILL THROW IN WHATEVER IS HINE THIS CURTAIN-- BEHIND THIS CURTAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THINK ABOUT IT. NOW, FOLKS. APPARENTLY THERE IS ONE DOWNSIDE TO DEFUNDING THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. JIM?
IMAGINE THE WEDDING OF YOUR DREAMS COMPLETELY RUINED BECAUSE OF CONGRESS.
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S WORKING WITH 24 COUPLES WHO WERE PLANNING OCTOBER WEDDING EVENTS AT NATIONAL MONUMENTS. COUPLES HAVE BEEN INFORMED THOSE EVENTS CAN'T TAKE PLACE IF THE GOVERNMENT STAYS SHUT DOWN.
MIKE AND MILA WERE SCHEDULED TO GET MARRIED THIS SATURDAY BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN CLOSED THEIR MEMORIAL AND CANCELLED THEIR PLANS.
WELL, MY FIRST IDEA WAS TO JUMP THE FENCE AND JUST DO IT ANYWAY BUT SHE CAN'T JUMP A FENCE IN A WEDDING DRESS AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ARRESTED ON MY WEDDING DAY.
THOUGH IF YOU WERE ARRESTED ON YOUR WEDDING DAY YOU WOULD SAVE A BUNDLE ON THE WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER. (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, FOLKS-- WITH NATIONAL PARKS SHUTTERED, HUNDREDS OF COUPLES HAVE HAD TO CANCEL THEIR WEDDING. NOW I'M 100% IN FAVOR OF THE SHUTDOWN. BUT I FEEL BAD FOR MIKE AND MYELIN, THEIR STORY IS CAUSING A SHUTDOWN IN-- WELL, NATION, YOU KNOW, I PROMISED YOU ON NIGHT ONE OF THE SHUTDOWN THAT AS LEADER OF THE COLBERT NATION AND EARL LORD OF THE AFTERSCAPE I WOULD PROVIDE ALL CANCELLED GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AND THAT INCLUDES WEDDINGS. NOW I DON'T USUALLY ADVERTISE THIS, FOLKS, BUT I AM ACTUALLY AN ORDER ANSWERED MINISTER-- OR DRAIN-- ORDAINED MINISTER OF THE AMERICAN MARRIAGE MINISTRY, ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MINISTRY CERTIFICATION YOU CAN GET ON-LINE WHILE ALSO BEING ON THE TOILET. SO I GOT TO ASK, WHAT DO YOU THINK, NATION, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT LOVE IS BIGGER THAN THIS SHUTDOWN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO YOU BELIEVE-- DO YOU BELIEVE I SHOULD MARRY MIKE AND MYELIN ON MY SHOW!
YEAH! WELL THEN THE NATION HAS SPOKEN. JIMMY, WE'RE HAVING A WEDDING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
