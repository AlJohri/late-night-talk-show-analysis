Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT-- FOLKS, FOR YEARS NOW, A DANGEROUS HORDE OF FUNDAMENTALISTS HAVE THREATENED TO DESTROY EVERYTHING WE LOVE. BUT NOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DEFEATED AND WE CAN GET BACK TO WORRYING ABOUT THE ISLAMIC STATE. AND WELL WE SHOULD BECAUSE WESTERNERS ARE JOINING THEIR RANKS.
THE FRESH WAVE OF HUNDREDS OF FOREIGNERS INCLUDING AMERICANS RUSHING TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE ISIS TERRORISTS.
THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING THREE AMERICAN TEENAGERS, HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM DENVER WHO HAD LEFT THIS COUNTRY, LURED AWAY THROUGH THE INTERNET, THEY SAY. THE TEENS WERE ON THE WAY TO JOIN TERROR GROUPS IN SYRIA.
IN THE LAST SIX WEEKS 1000 NEW FOREIGN FIGHTERS STREAMED INTO SYRIA AND IRAQ. THERE ARE NOW $16,000 THERE, NEARLY 3,000 ARE WESTERNERS.
Stephen: YES, THOUSANDS OF WESTERNERS ARE JOINING ISIS. SOME PEOPLE WILL DO ANYTHING TO AVOID THE HOLIDAYS WITH THEIR FAMILY. AND WITH GOVERNMENT STOPPING THESE TERRORISTS AT BORDERS AND AIRPORTS, ISIS IS EXPLOITING SECURITY LOOPHOLES AND SECURITY PORTHOLES.
WOULD-BE TERRORISTS ARE PACKING THEIR BAGS FOR THE JIHADI CRUISE, WITH AIRPORTS STEPPING UP SECURITY AROUND THE WORLD, KEEPING WANNABE JIHADISTS FROM JOINING ISIS IN SYRIA, TERRORISTS ARE USING CRUISE SHIPS TO FERRY THEM INTO BATTLE.
INTERPOL SAYS THEY ARE TAKING CRUISE LINES THAT  STOP AT A TURKISH COASTAL TOWN. FROM THERE IT IS EASY TO CROSS INTO SYRIA.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, TERRORISTS ARE HEADING TO THE ISLAMIC STATE VIA CRUISE SHIP. AND FOLKS, IF THEY HATED WESTERN CULTURE WHEN THEY GOT ON, JUST IMAGINE HOW THEY WILL FEEL AFTER SIX NIGHTS OF DINNER THEATRE. THESE JIHADIES OF THE JI-HIGH SEAS MUST BE STOPPED. WHICH IS WHY I'M EXCITED TO RELAUNCH THE COLBERT CRUISE. MY WILDLY POPULAR SERIES OF NAUTICAL VACATIONS THAT I HAVE NOT MENTIONED IN EIGHT YEARS. MY LATEST COLBERT CRUISE IS GUARANTEED TO TRAP ANY WOULD-BE TERRORIST. JIM?
READY TO GET AWAY? AND JOIN ISIS? AND COME ABOARD THE COLBERT CRUISE. YA, MAN. IT'S TIME TO TRADE IN THAT SUICIDE VEST FOR SUICIDE CARGO SHORTS. OUR CABINS ARE SO LUXURIOUS. YOU WILL THINK YOU HAVE BLOWN UP AND GONE TO HEAVEN. DECLARE A FATWAH, ON HUNGER WITH OUR DECADENT HUMMUS FOUNTAIN. AND PARTAKE IN OUR EXCITING SHORE EXCURSIONS LIKE SCUBA DIVING, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE YOU WILL RUN INTO A CELEBRITY. RELAX, WITH ROUND-THE-CLOCK SPA TREATMENTS INCLUDING COMPLIMENTARY HYDRO THERAPY. A SEVEN DAY FUN-FILLED TRIP TO THE SHORES OF TURKEY BY WAY OF CUBA. SO A'HOY, IT'S TIME TO LEAVE YOUR WORRIES AND THE GENEVA CONVENTION BEHIND. JOIN US ON THE COLBERT CRUISE WHERE YOU WILL MAKE MEMORIES THAT WILL LAST THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I GUARANTEE IT.
Stephen: FOLKS,  THOSE VICIOUS-- PEOPLE LOVE THE CRUISE. THOSE VICIOUS MILITANTS WILL BE IN DEEP DOO-DOO, THEIR OWN BECAUSE THE CRUISE IS RUN BY CARNIVAL
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
