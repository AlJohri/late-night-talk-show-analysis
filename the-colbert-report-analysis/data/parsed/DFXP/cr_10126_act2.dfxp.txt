[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING ACTOR WHO STARS IN THE NEW ROMANTIC COMEDY CALLED THEY CAME TOGETHER. I'M GOING TO TEAR HIM APART. PLEASE WELCOME PAUL RUDD. HEY, PAUL. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR STOPPING BY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR WEARING TWEED IN JUNE.
SEEMED LIKE THE WRONG CHOICE.
Stephen: IT IS BALLSY IN THAT I'M GUESSING YOU'RE SWEATING YOUR BALLS OFF RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE CORRECT, SIR.
Stephen: FOR THE FEW PEOPLE IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW IT, YOU'RE AN AWARD-WINNING ACTOR/WRITER PRODUCER, BEST KNOWN FOR "40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN" AND "CLUELESS." YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE CALLED "THEY CAME TOGETHER." IT COMES OUT TOMORROW. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DIRTY MOVIE. IS THERE ANY HARDCORE ACTION IN THIS?
SURPRISINGLY NO. BUT THE TITLE IS MEANT TO INFER IT I'D SAY.
Stephen: OKAY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY THERE IS HARD CORE ACTION IN IT.
THERE'S A TON OF IT. IT IS...
STEPHEN: YOU GO TO BONETOWN?
YOU GO TO BONETOWN. STAY IN BONETOWN FOR ABOUT 80 MINUTES.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THAT'S KIND OF IMPRESSIVE. [LAUGHTER] I GOT A TWO-PART QUESTION. WHAT IS THE MOVIE ABOUT, AND GIVEN OUR MODERN OVERSCHEDULED LIVES, THAT LEAVE US SO LITTLE TIME TO READ BOOKS OR EVEN BE WITH LOVED ONES, SHOULD PEOPLE BE GOING TO MOVIES? [LAUGHTER]
I THINK THAT'S A VERY VALID QUESTION.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
TO MAKE IT EASIER, YOU CAN WATCH IT ON YOUR PHONE. IT'S AVAILABLE ON ALL PHONES TOMORROW, AND YOU... I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT. HERE'S THE THING, THE MOVIE IS PAPER THIN. THERE'S NO SUBSTANCE HERE AT ALL.
Stephen: REALLY? ME LIKEY.
YOU CAN KIND OF HALF PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR CHILDREN. YOU CAN KIND OF HALF PAY ATTENTION TO MAKING DINNER, AND YOU CAN JUST WATCH... AND IT'S QUICK. FLIES BY.
Stephen: CAN YOU REALLY GET THIS ON YOUR PHONE?
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET IT ON YOUR PHONE BECAUSE ALL MOVIES ARE AVAILABLE ON PHONES NOW.
Stephen: I COULD WATCH IT WHILE I'M DRIVING.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT'S THE LAST THING I SEE BEFORE I GO OFF THE ABUTMENT, YOU AND AMY POEHLER GOING TO BONE TOWN.
AND YOU CAN TEXT SOMEBODY WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING.
Stephen: YOU'RE OPENING AGAINST "TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF DISTINCTION."
TO SAY OUR MOVIE IS COMPETITION... I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING TRANSFORMERS IS COMPETITION TO US.
Stephen: YES, IT IS.
I FEEL AS THOUGH THAT'S AN INSULT TO THE WORD COMPETITION.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THIS IS YOU. THIS IS AMY POEHLER, DAVID WAIN, WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER, SAME GUY
IT'S A VERY, VERY SOLID AND FUNNY CAST. ED HELMS. MICHAEL IAN BLACK. A LOT OF REALLY FUNNY PEOPLE. MANY OTHERS THAT I'M NOT EVEN MENTIONING.
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU NOT MENTIONING THEM? DO YOU NOT LIKE THEM? DO YOU NOT CARE FOR THEM?
THEY KNOW WHY.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT META IN THE WAY SOME OF DAVID'S FILMS ARE, LIKE "WET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER."
Stephen: LET'S SHOW THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU MEAN. LET'S WATCH THE CLIP.
SO MOLLY, HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?
OH BOY, IT'S A LONG STORY.
WE GOT TIME. WAITER. MORE WINE.
WELL, KIND OF A CORNY ROMANTIC COMEDY KIND OF STORY.
THAT IS TRUE.
HOW SO?
WELL, JOEL IS A TYPICAL ROMANTIC COMEDY LEADING MAN. HE'S HANDSOME BUT IN A NON-THREATENING WAY. VAGUELY BUT NOT OVERTLY JEWISH.
YOU'RE RIGHT. JUST JEWISH ENOUGH.
AND MOLLY IS THE KIND OF CUTE KLUTZY GIRL THAT WILL DRIVE YOU A LITLTLE CRAZY BUT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.
OKAY. WE HAVE OUR MAIN CHARACTERS.
NOT QUITE. THERE WAS ANOTHER CHARACTER JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE TWO OF US, NEW YORK CITY.
AH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SO IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT WHAT MOVIES ARE LIKE.
THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, WE'RE KIND OF POKING FUN AT THE TROPES OF A WELL-ESTABLISHED CONVENTION. SOMETHING I THINK YOUR AUDIENCE IS FAMILIAR. WITH.
IT'S LIKE SERVING A MEAL THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE FOOD, LIKE A HOT DOG.
WE'RE PRESENTING SOMETHING THAT'S ALMOST LIKE A MOVIE. BUT IT DOES TEND TO KIND OF...
Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S ALMOST AN ATTACK ON ROMANTIC COMEDIES.
IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ON ROMANTIC COMEDIES. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS A BIT OF AN HOMAGE, BUT AS KIND OF... [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: IT'S AN HOMAGE.
IT'S A TOOTHLESS ATTACK BUT A VICIOUS HOMAGE.
Stephen: WOW I LOVE IT. THAT'S WONDERFUL.
IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. AND THEN JUST AS WE'RE POKING FUN AT THESE THINGS THAT YOU'VE SEEN A HUNDRED TIME, IT WILL VEER OFF INTO JUST WEIRDSVILLE, WHERE A SCENE WILL EVOLVE OR DEVOLVE INTO SOMETHING JUST BIZARRE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING.
Stephen: WOW. MUCH LIKE THE TRANSFORMERS MOVIE. PERFECT. PERFECT.
YOU SEE.
Stephen: THAT IS HOW YOU PUT ASSES IN THE SEATS, PAUL RUDD.
SUCK ON THAT, MICHAEL BAY.
Stephen: CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A MINUTE, BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED MORE OF THIS. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
I'VE GOT TO GO.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE PAUL RUDD.
