Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT ISY ACCLAIMED  BRITISH ACTOR WHOSE NEW BLUES  ALBUM IS CALLED DIDN'T IT RAIN. WILL IT BE RECORDED IN ENGLAND? THE ANSWER IS YES. PLEASE WELCOME HUGH LAURIE. NICE TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. I'M A HUGE FAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
LIKEWISE. Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THIS IS GOING VERY WELL SO  FAR.
YES. Stephen: ACTOR NOVELIST  MUSICIAN, PLAYED DR. GROWING  REHOUSE ON THE TV SERIES HOUSE FOR HOW MANY SEASONS?
EIGHT. Stephen: EIGHT SEASONS, WOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: OKAY. YOU ALSO ARE AMUSE I CANNIAN  WHICH I WAS NOT AWARE OF. AND YOU HAD A BLUES ALBUM  ALREADY CALLED, IT WAS CALLED  "LET THEM TALK."
YES. Stephen: SOLD A MILLION  COPIES IN THIS MUSICAL  ATMOSPHERE YOU WENT IN ENGLAND  TRIPLE PLATINUM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD SO MUCH  AS WHISTLE AND YOU SOLD A  MILLION ALBUMS.
WHISTLING IS MY WEAKEST SUIT. I HAVE TO WHISTLE IN ONE OF THE  SONGS WE DO REQUIRES WHISTLING  AND I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE. I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU AGREE TO  DO IT THEN IF YOU CAN'T DO IT?
NOT ONLY DID I AGREE TO IT. I VOLUNTEERED THAT. WHY WOULD I DO THAT? I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS SORT OF A STRANGE,  SELF-DESTRUCTIVE.
Stephen: BLUES WHISTLING. SOME OF THE GREAT DELTA  WHISTLERS.
YOU DON'T HEAR SO MUCH OF IT  NOW.
Stephen: NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE. NOT FROM ME. Stephen: WHY IS A WHITE  ENGLISH GUY -- I ASSUME YOU'RE  WHITE BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE. I DON'T SEE RACE. BUT ANYWAY, WHY ARE YOU  RECORDING THE BLUES? THAT IS THE GREAT BLACK AMERICAN  ART FORM.
IT IS. IT IS. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
Stephen: ARE YOU COMING TO  APOLOGIZE?
I WILL CONCEDE THAT I APPEAR  TO BE MONUMENTALLY UNSUIT FOR  THIS TASK. HOWEVER, THIS IS MUSIC THAT I  HAVE LOVED SINCE I WAS... I  SUPPOSE BEING ENGLISH I COULD BE TRYING TO SING RECORDS OF  GILBERT AND SULLIVAN OR DURAN,  DURAN.
Stephen: OR GILBERT AND  DURAN.
THE WHISTLING BROTHER. BUT THEY JUST DIDN'T TOUCH ME  THE WAY THIS MUSIC TOUCHED ME. WHEN I WAS VERY, VERY YOUNG. IT'S MUSIC I'VE LOVED ALL MY  LIFE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW ALBUM  CALLED "DIDN'T IT RAIN"? YOU CAN SEE IT'S ON THE COVER  PLAYING A VERY, VERY SMALL  PIANO. ADORABLE. DO YOU HAVE TO LIVE THE BLUES TO  PLAY THE BLUES? BECAUSE I ALWAYS HEARD YOU'VE  GOT TO LIVE THE BLUES. TO PLAY THE BLUES.
WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'M GOING TO  SAY NO BECAUSE THAT'S THE  POSITION I'M IN.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU'RE AN INTERNATIONAL STAR WHO  WAS UNTIL LAST YEAR THE HIGHEST  PAID MAN IN A DRAMA. THAT'S NOT EXACTLY  SHARECROPPING.
NO. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I WAS HANDSOMELY COMPENSATED.
Stephen: AND A HANDSOME MAN  AS WELL.
THANK YOU FOR THAT. Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY. MY POINT IS THAT TO ME THIS  MUSIC, I WOULD HATE FOR THIS  MUSIC TO BE JUST PUT IN A BOX OF SORT OF A SOCIOLOGICAL CATEGORY  OF AMERICAN FOLK MUSIC THAT IS  ONLY... IT OMAHAS MEANING BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE AND  THE PERIOD FROM WHICH IT GREW. I THINK OF THIS MUSIC AS HIGH  ART, AS HIGH AS THIS... SOME  BROKE SINGING DON GIOVANNI DOWN THE ROAD.
Stephen: SINCE YOU PLAYED  HOUSE FOR SO LONG, DO YOU STILL  HAVE THE PRESCRIPTION PAD BY ANY  CHANCE? BECAUSE I COULD GO FOR SOME LIKE  VICODIN OR...
I ACTUALLY DO HAVE A STOCK OF  THE RELEVANT STATIONERY. I REALLY DO.
Stephen: DID YOU TAKE IT AND  THINK, "YOU KNOW, THIS MIGHT  COME IN HANDY LATER IF I LOSE EVERYTHING."
I SUPPOSE I WAS THINKING  CHARMING MEMENTO, BUT AS YOU SAY  IT COULD COME IN HANDY IF THINGS GO SOUTH.
Stephen: DO YOU SING ON THESE  ALBUMS?
I DO. Stephen: DO YOU SING WITH AN  ENGLISH ACCENT OR AN AMERICAN  ACCENT?
I'M NOT REALLY AWARE... I  DON'T CONSCIOUSLY DO IT BUT I  THINK I THINK WITH AN AMERICAN  ACCENT.
Stephen: YOU KIND OF GET INTO  HOUSE AND THEN... (LAUGHING)  WHAT'S THE FIRST STEP FOR YOU TO CONQUER THE AMERICAN ACCENT  BECAUSE FOR AN AMERICAN TO DO  LIKE A BRITISH ACCENT YOU HAVE TO FIRST GET IN THE MIND SET OF  LIKE, YOU KNOW, BEANS AND DRIED  FISH IS IS A GREAT BREAKFAST. YOU KNOW?
ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY, I THINK  THAT'S NOT FAIR. I THINK BREAKFAST IS ONE OF THE  THINGS WE DO DO WELL, ALMOST AS  WELL AS YOU DO IT OVER HERE. IT'S A GREAT BOND BETWEEN  ENGLAND AND AMERICA. WE UNDERSTAND BREAKFAST.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. I APOLOGIZE.
THANK YOU. Stephen: I APOLOGIZE. JAZZ IS THE AMERICA'S GREATEST  GIFT TO THE WORLD.
I WOULD SAY JAZZ IS AMERICA'S  GREATEST GIFT.
Stephen: REALLY? NOT TO DENIGRATE OTHER GIFTS. BLUES I THINK OF AS A SUB SET OF  JAZZ.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT ENGLAND'S GREATEST  GIFT TO THE WORLD IS? AMERICA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.
THANK YOU. Stephen: HUGH LAURIE. THE ALBUM IS "DIDN'T IT RAIN"? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
