Stephen: TONIGHT, RACIAL  TENSIONS RISE. I'LL TELL YOU THE HOT NEW  ETHNICITY TO BLAME. THEN, HAVE AMERICANS LOST THEIR  ATTENTION SPAN? AND HAVE AMERICANS LOST THEIR  ATTENTION SPAN? AND MY GUEST DAVID KARP IS THE  FOUNDER AND CEO OF TUMBLR WHICH  I BELIEVE IS A SOCIAL NET YORK FOR DRYERS. J.K. ROWLING ANNOUNCED SHE  SECRETLY WROTE A CRIME NOVEL  UNDER THE NAME ROBERT GALBRAITH. WHAT A COINCIDENCE I WROTE A  SERIES OF WIZARD BOOKS UNDER THE  NAME J.K. ROWLING. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by      COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BASED ON  WHAT I JUST HEARD, I CERTAINLY  HOPE NONE OF YOU EVER STOP MAKING YOUR MUSIC. YOU CAN SING. YOU CAN SING. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  YOU KNOW THAT I AM A PROUD  AMERICAN. EVERY DAY I THANK GOD THAT THIS  COUNTRY THREW OFF THE YOLK OF  BRITISH TYRANNY. WE BOW TO NO KING. LET THE PATRIOT BLOODSHED ON THE  FIELDS OF LEXINGTON AND CONCORDE  NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND SO OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT:  ROYAL BABY BUMP. OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! LOOK, SHE IS SO RADIANT. JIM?
COULD TODAY BE THE DAY THAT  THE THIRD DIRECT HEIR TO THE  BRITISH THRONE MAKES HIS OR HER  DEBUT?
IT'S WEEK 3 AND THE WORLD IS  LITERALLY WAITING ON EDGE FOR  KATE TO GO INTO LABOR.
THE GREAT KATE WAIT. CONTINUES.
WILL IT BE A GIRL OR A BOY? LONDON IS SWELTERING IN A  HEAT WAVE BUT THAT HASN'T PUT  OFF THE WORLD'S MEDIA OR THE  TOURISTS.
HERE AT THE HOSPITAL IT'S  NOTHING SHORT OF A BABY  STAKEOUT.
THE U.K. IS ABUZZ WITH  EXCITEMENT. LOOK, THE U.S. IS ABUZZ WITH  EXCITEMENT. THE WHOLE WORLD IS ABUZZ WITH  EXCITEMENT.
Stephen: THE WHOLE WORLD IS  ABUZZ. THE WHOLE GALAXY IS IS ABECAUSE. KATE THE GREAT IS THREE DAYS  LATE. I JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR HER TO  DILATE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I MEAN WHEN AND WHEN? I MEAN, WHEN WILL THE HEIR TO  THE CROWN BEGIN TO CROWN? I MEAN, WAIT, WAIT, WHAT AM I  THINKING? THE BRITS USE METRIC SO NINE  MONTHS THERE MIGHT BE TEN KILO  WEEKS OVER HERE. WHEN WILL THAT BABY GET HERE? WHAT WILL PIPPA WEAR? WILL THE OBSTETRICIAN WEAR A  GIANT HAT? WHO WILL HAVE LESS HAIR, THE  BABY OR PRINCE WILLIAM? I'M SO EXCITED. BREATHE, STEPHEN. JUST BREATHE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST GOT TO... PICK A SPOT ON  THE WALL AND FOCUS. I NEED ICE CHIPS. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I MEAN I CANNOT GET ENOUGH. I HAVE GOT TO HAVE THE LATEST  SCOOPS. I MEAN, "U.S. WEEKLY" HAS A  SPECIAL REPORTS IN AN EXCLUSIVE  THAT PADDINGTON BEAR WILL BE IN THE ROOM SAYS A SOURCE. YES, PADDING TON. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER BELOVED  BRITISH CHILDREN'S CHARACTER HE  LIKE WINNIE-THE-POOH OR SID  VICIOUS? I NEED TO KNOW. OH, GOD, AND THE PAGEANTRY. YOU KNOW THE HOSPITAL WILL HAVE  THE FINEST HORSE-DRAWN GURNEY,  AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE CHANGING OF THE GUARDS IN FRONT  OF THE ROYAL BIRTH CANAL AND THE  EPIDURAL ADMINISTERS BY DUMBLEDORE WHILE ELTON JOHN ON  PIANO PLAYS "PLACENTA IN THE  WIND."  THE QUESTION IS, WILL IT BE A GIRL OR A BOY OR MAYBE SOMETHING  MAGICAL LIKE A UNICORN OR A  HOBBIT? WHAT HAS IT GOT IN ITS UTERUS,  PRECIOUS? WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS  THE WATER BREAKS. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU  SHOULD NEVER LOOK A GIFT HORSE  IN THE MOUTH, BUT I SAY YOU SHOULD NEVER REGISTER FOR A  HORSE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THAT  THING? YOU'RE NEWLYWEDS. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FIRST UP, YOU'RE VERY KIND. FIRST UP, BY NOW YOU ALL KNOW  GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAS BEEN  ACQUITTED IN A HIGH-PROFILE CASE STEEPED IN RACIAL TEDGES, WE IN  THE CABLE-FEAR KNEW THAT IF  ZIMMERMAN WALKED OUR CITIES WOULD BURN.
FLORIDA PREPARING FOR RIOTS  IF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN IS ACQUITTED  OF MURDER.
THERE MAY BE RIOTS. FLORIDA POLICE ARE PREPARING  FOR RIOTS.
I THINK WE'RE BEING FOOLISH  AND FRANKLY NAIVE TO THINK THAT  THERE MAY NOT BE RIOTS.
YES, TO THINK THERE MAY NOT  BE RIOTS IS FOOLISH AND NAIVE  AND WORST OF ALL, ACCURATE.
THINGS HAVE REMAINED CALM AND  PEACEFUL HERE IN SANFORD  FLORIDA.
CROWDS GATHERED IN NEWARK FOR  A PEACEFUL PROTEST.
THE PROTESTS ACROSS WERE  PEACEFUL LOUD BUT PEACE TELE.
A GROUP OF YOUNG  DEMONSTRATORS HAD ANY MOGUL  MOMENT AS THEY SANG QUIETLY ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL  BUILDING IN TALLAHASSEE.
Stephen: SANG QUIETLY. EXCUSE ME. I ORDERED A RIOT. ALL I GET IS A FOLK FESTIVAL. STOP SINGING "IF I HAD A HAMMER"  AND START SWINGING ONE OF THEM  AROUND. SO A WAG OF MY FINGER AT  NONRIOTING BLACK PEOPLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LISTEN, LISTEN. YEAH, WE'RE ALL ANGRY. YOU CANNOT SET THE BAR AT RODNEY  KING AND THEN GIVE ME THIS WEAK [BLEEP]. YES, MAYBE IN LOS ANGELES THEY  SCARED IN DRIVERS AND IN OAKLAND  PROTESTORS VANDALIZED A MEN'S WAREHOUSE STORE. BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WASN'T EVEN  ABOUT THE ACQUITTAL OF GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN. THEY WERE MAD ABOUT THE RECENT  FIRING OF MEN'S WAREHOUSE  FOUNDER GEORGE ZIMMER. BECAUSE UNLIKE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN,  HE DOES LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK. SO THAT'S IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S ALL I GET. THAT'S IT? I JUST GET THE BROKEN GLASS AND  AN OVERTURNED RACK OF SEPARATES. HAVE WE FORGOTTEN RODNEY KING? I MEAN THAT WAS A RIOT. WHERE ARE THE BUILDINGS ON FIRE? YOU'RE JUST NOT HOLDING UP YOUR  END OF WHAT WE SAID YOU WOULD  DO. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WAS ACQUITTED  BECAUSE A JURY UNDERSTOOD WHY HE  FELT THREATENED BY AN UNARMED BLACK YOUTH. AND WHY WOULDN'T HE FEEL THAT  WAY? THEY RIOT. BUT IF YOU DON'T RIOT, YOU SEEM  LESS THREATENING. THEN ZIMMERMAN WILL SEEM LIKE A  BAD GUY. AND THAT WOULD BE A TRAGIC  ENDING TO THIS STORY. BECAUSE AS IT IS, HE'S GOING TO  HAVE TO LIVE HIS LIFE AS A  MARKED MAN AS HIS BROTHER ROBERT  SAID.
CLEARLY HE'S A FREE MAN IN  THE EYES OF THE COURT BUT HE'S  GOING TO BE LOOKING AROUND HIS SHOULDER FOR THE REST OF HIS  LIFE.
Stephen: YES, HE'LL BE  LOOKING AROUND HIS SHOULDER. CAN YOU IMAGINE FEELING LIKE  YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED. EVERYONE JUST ASSUMING YOU'RE A  CRIMINAL. I MEAN, IF I WERE HIM, I WOULD  WEAR SOMETHING TO HIDE MY FACE. NEXT ON THE T-DUBS, A TIP OF THE  HAT TO FOX NEWS FOR BRINGING IN  SOME FRESH BLOOD AND NOT JUST FOR RUPERT MURDOCH'S WINE  CELLAR. JIM?
ELIZABETH HASSELBECK WILL BE  JOINING US VERY SHORTLY IN  SEPTEMBER TO BE ONE OF THE HOSTS OF FOX AND FRIENDS. SHE'LL BE COMING ON OVER TO THE  CURVY COUCH.
Stephen: ELIZABETH HASSELBECK  FROM THE VIEW WILL BE REPLACING  GRETCHEN CARLSON ON FOX AND FRIENDS OR AS THE BROWN-HAIRED  GUY WHO IS NOT STEVE DOOCY PUTS  IT, "ARE YOU MY NEW WOMAN?" THE GRETCH WHO SAVED CHRISTMAS  IS ABANDONING HER COUCH BUDDIES  TO TAKE OVER MEGYN KELLY'S SPOT IN THE ARCH WHICH DISAPPOINTS ME  BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT THEY  WERE FOX AND FRIENDS BUT I GUESS FOR GRETCHEN, IT WAS JUST FOX  AND BUSINESS. MEANWHILE MEGYN KELLY'S MOVING  TO PRIME TIME RUMOR HAS IT  TAKING GRETA VAN SUSTERANT'S TIME SLOT. I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE FOOTAGE  OF THE FOX NEWS RESCHEDULING IN  PROGRESS. SO, BRAVO. BRAVO, FOX NEWS FOR BOLDLY  CHANGING THE FACE OF NEWS. NOT THE THE HAIR. JUST THE FACE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
