( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY  '80s POP SINGER WHO WAS  WEARING OUTRAGEOUS OUTFITS WHEN LADY GAGA WAS STILL BABY GAGA. PLEASE WELCOME CYNDI LAUPER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I'M AN ENORMOUS FAN,  MAN.
ME TOO. Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO  YOU ARE. YOU MEGA STAR. SHE'S SO UNUSUAL. YOU GOT EMMYS. YOU GOT GRAMMIES AND NOW YOU ARE  THE COMPOSER AND LYRACIST OF  KINKY BOOTS, ORIGINAL BROADWAY  SHOW. NOMINATED FOR 13 TONY AWARDS. CONGRATULATIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IN THE YEAR '13. Stephen: IN THE YEAR 13. ARE YOU A NEUM ROLLINGS.
NO. I ONLY PLAY A PSYCHIC ON  TELEVISION. I'M NOT REALLY A PSYCHIC.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND LIKE  SEEN PHOTOS. GOT LOVELY LADIES IN THAT. THESE ARE SOME OF THE KINKY  BOOTS WE TALK ABOUT.
STEPHEN, I'M TELLING YOU, YOU  SHOULD TRY THIS ON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WE SHALL SEE. NOW IS THIS ALL ORIGINAL OR LIKE  A GIRLS' SONG?
THIS IS ALL ORIGINAL. I HAD... I WAS MINDING MY OWN  BUSINESS. AND IT WAS LIKE I HAD COME OFF A  PUNISHMENT. I WAS LIKE LET'S PLAY EUROPE. SO I DID. AND I WAS IN A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS  BEING TOSSED IN THE BACK LIKE A  BUSHEL OF VEGETABLES. THEN I CAME BACK. I SAW MY FAMILY. I FINISHED THE DINNER DISHES AND  THE PHONE RANG. IT WAS HARVEY. HE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO  A BROADWAY SHOW? THE STORY IS THERE WAS A SHOE  FACTORY LIKE AN OLD-FASHIONED  FROM HAND MADE SHOE, A MANUFACTURING PLANT WHERE THEY  WERE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. THEY NEEDED SOMETHING TO SAVE  THE FACTORY AND SAVE A VILLAGE  IT WAS IN.
THEY DID. THEY STARTED GETTING KINKY.
Stephen: HOW DID THIS SAVE  THE TOWN? WHO BUYS THESE?
IT'S A NICHE MARKET,. Stephen: OF? OF MEN WHO ARE MEN BUT WEAR  WOMEN'S CLOTHING. BUT IT'S ALSO THEY HAVE SOME  STUFF FOR WOMEN. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO GO VISIT  IT.
Stephen: IT'S FOR DRAG  QUEENS?
YES, NO. Stephen: YES, NO. FOR DRAG QUEENS BUT IT'S ALSO  KINKY. IT'S LIKE WOMEN COULD HAVE,  LISTEN, YOU COULD WEAR BOOTS  TOO. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE BOOTS MAKE  FOR WALKING AND THEN THERE'S  BOOTS THAT YOU DON'T WALK MUCH  IN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OKAY. IT'S KIND OF AN EVERY MAN'S  STORY.
YES. Stephen: IF EVERY MAN ALSO  WANTED TO DRESS LIKE EVERY  WOMAN.
THIS IS ABOUT DRAG. BUT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT DRAG. IT'S REALLY ABOUT ACCEPTANCE OF  OTHER PEOPLE. AS SOON AS I SAW IT, YOU  COULDN'T... THE GREAT THING IS  YOU COULDN'T FIND TWO MORE DIFFERENT MEN BUT STILL THE  MANUFACTURER COULD NOT BE WHAT  HIS FATHER WANTED HIM TO BE, WANTED HIM TO TALK OVER THE  FACTORY AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO. AND THE DRAG QUEEN, HIS FATHER  WANTED HIM TO BE A BOXER. HE WAS A YOUNG BLACK MAN IN  ENGLAND. AND THE WAY HE THOUGHT IF HE WAS  STRONG AND HE WAS BLACK AND HE  COULD FIGHT, HE COULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIMSELF, YOU KNOW. THE SAME WAY THE GUY FELT I HAVE  A SHOE FACTORY IF YOU TAKE OVER  THE SHOE FACTORY YOU'LL HAVE A PLACE IN THE WORLD. IT'S A MISTAKE A LOT OF PARENTS  MAKE. BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE  PARENTS SO MUCH AS ABOUT THE MEN  WHO COME TO TERMS WITH HEALING AND ACCEPTANCE OF OTHER PEOPLE. AND WHEN YOU ACCEPT OTHER  PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT  YOURSELF TOO. THAT SOMETIMES IS THE HARDEST  THING, TO ACCEPT YOURSELF. SO IT'S ABOUT HEALING. THAT'S WHY I WAS IN. I THOUGHT, WOW...
Stephen: WHAT DID YOUR  PARENTS WANT YOU TO BE?
OH, I THINK THEY JUST WANTED  ME TO LIVE.
Stephen: HOW DID THAT WORK  OUT?
I DID OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: CYNDI, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. CYNDI LAUPER. KINKY BOOTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
