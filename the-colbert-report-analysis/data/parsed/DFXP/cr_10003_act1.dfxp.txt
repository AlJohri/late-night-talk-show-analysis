IT'S BEEN 17 YEARS SINCE THE LAST GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
THE LAST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN STARTED IN 1995. IT WAS A BUDGET DISPUTE BETWEEN PRESIDENT CLINTON AND NEWT GINGRICH. IT LASTED 28 DAYS.

RECORDING STAR OF 1995, PLEASE WELCOME CIEWLIO! CULIO? ( LAUGHTER ) OH, GOD. CULIO. I-- I SHOULD HAVE PUNCHED SOME AIR HOLES IN THIS THING. I GUESS HE'S GONE TO GANGSTA PARADISE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, ANYWAY, HE'LL BE-- HE'LL BE FINE. HE'LL BE FINE, FOLKS. YOU KNOW WHAT? IN FACT, WE'LL ALL BE FINE, RIGHT, TV FRIENDS?
THERE'S A VERY LIMITED ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM THIS SHUTDOWN.
RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A DAY IT'S COSTING, BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL ECONOMICALLY.
REALITY OF THIS IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WILL NOTICE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
ANOTHER THICK THAT G.O.P. LEADERSHIP NEEDS TO DO IS REMIND THE PUBLIC THIS IS NOT ARMAGEDDON. THIS IS A PIN PRICK.
Stephen:  YES, A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IS NO MORE DAMAGING TO THE ECONOMY THAN A PIN PRICK, OKAY. FOR INSTANCE, HERE'S THE ECONOMY. HERE'S THE SHUTDOWN. SEE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE ECONOMY STILL EXISTS. OKAY. IN FACT, FOLKS, THIS SHUTDOWN IS SO NOT BIG A DEAL, WE NOT EVEN CALLING IT A SHUTDOWN ANYMORE.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE RCALLING IT A SLIM-DOWN. TAKE A LOOK AT THE FOX NEWS WEB SITE.
Stephen:  THAT'S CNN-- ITS MOST TRUSTED NAME IN READING OTHER NETWORKS' WEB SITES.   ( APPLAUSE ) AND SHE'S RIGHT. FOX NEWS IS CALLING IT A "SLIMDOWN." WHICH IS A GREAT NAME BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO IS REALLY GOING TO SLIM DOWN? THE 9 MILLION WOMEN ASK CHILDREN WHO WILL LOSE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S JUST CHIVALROUS-- REMEMBER, REMEMBER, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST. THE POINT, IS THE SLIM-DOWN IS A GOOD THING, AND IT'S ALL OBAMA'S FAULT.
SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER INSISTING IT'S THE PRESIDENT WHO OPENS THE SHUTDOWN.
REFUSING TO COME TO THE TABLE, OBAMA, AND REID ARE COUNTING ON THE MEDIA LAP DOGS TO BLAME REPUBLICANS.
WHERE IS OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF? WHY ISN'T HE ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW CALLING THE SENATE AND HOUSE LEADERSHIP AND TELLING THEM OUR NATION IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN?
Stephen:  YES, WHY ISN'T THE PRESIDENT TELLING CONGRESS THAT SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT IS BAD? AND WHY WON'T HE TELL THEM THE STOVE IS HOT? ( LAUGHTER ). BOEHNER KEEPS BURNING HIS HAND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.   ( APPLAUSE ) FINALLY, FINALLY, FOLKS, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK SO LONG, TODAY, OBAMA DID THE RIGHT THING.
JUST WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, WE LEARNED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA INVITED CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON FOR A MEETING TO DISCUSS THE SHUTDOWN.
WE GOT WORD JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO-- THIS IS HAVE A A TWEET FROM THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY-- SAYING, POTUS INVITE SENATOR REID, NANCY PELOSI, McCONNELL AND SPEAKER BOEHNER TO THE HOUSE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE NEED TO REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT, RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, ALL OF THAT.
Stephen:  OKAY, GREAT. NOW BOTH SIDES CAN WORK UP ON THE A COMPROMISE. OBAMA CAN GIVE SOME CONCESSIONS, AND THE REPUBLICANS CAN ACCEPT HIS CONCESSIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) TWO-WAY STREET. AS LONG AS-- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT-- AS LONG AS THE REPUBLICANS DON'T BLINK.
TED CRUZ SENT OUT A TWEET TONIGHT THAT JUST SAID HASHTAG DON'T BLINK.
I'M NOT BLINKING OR FLINCHING.
I'M WE'RE NOT BLINKING. WE'RE TAKING NO-DOZ.Z.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, NOT BLINKING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN FACT, MICHELE BACHMANN HAS BEEN TRAINING
