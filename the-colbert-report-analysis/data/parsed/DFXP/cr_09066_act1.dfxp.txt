Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW  SCANDAL ROCKS THE VATICAN. THE HOLY WATER CONTAINS TRACES  OF HORSE MEAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, A NEW WAY TO REDUCE THE  NUMBER OF GUNS. STEP ONE:  GET A GUN. AND MY GUEST SIMON GARFIELD HAS  A NEW BOOK ABOUT MAPS CHANGING  OUR VIEW OF THE WORLD. WELL, APPLE MAPS CERTAINLY TOOK  ME TO PLACES I NEVER IMAGINED. SOUTHCUBAN PRESIDENT RAUL CASTRO SAYS  HE WILL RETIRE IN FIVE YEARS. DON'T BELIEVE HIM, COMAN IN. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT".  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING SEE STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU. IN HERE, OUT THERE, I WANT TO  SAY HELLO TO ALL MY FRIENDS IN  THE STUDIO TONIGHT AND SOME OLD FRIENDS WATCHING FROM HOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] FOLKS -- IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  AND WE'RE ON AN HONOR'S SYSTEM  HERE, I KNOW THERE'S ONE THING I'M DON'T -- I DON'T LIKE ABOUT  HOLLYWOOD AWARDER SERMON YOURS. IT'S WHEN I'M NOT NOMINATED. LAST NIGHT THE OSCARS TOOK TOP  ACHIEVEMENT IN CHAPPING MY HIDE. LAST NIGHT THERE WERE HIT AND  MISSES ON THE RED CARPET. JENNIFER LAWRENCE RADIANT,  JESSICA CHASTAIN, RAV VASHING  BUT ANNE HATHAWAY -- NO! NO! GIRL, IF I WANT TO SEE AN OSCAR  NOMINEE AND A PAIR OF ROCK HARD  NIPPLES, I'D WATCH HUGH JACKMAN WORK OUT WITH SCOTT PELLEY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS FOR THE AWARDS THEMSELVES, I  DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THEY HAD THE GAL TO GIVE OUR  MERNL -- GALL TO GIVE OUR ARMY  OSCARS TO A LIMEY, A GERMY AND --  [LAUGHTER] WHEN IT WAS THE BEST AWARD, WAS  IT PRESENTED BY A MOVIE STAR? NO, IT WAS PRESENTED BY MICHELLE  OBAMA FOLLOWED BY A PIEFL  WRINKLED LAUNDRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] OH, AND DID MRS. OBAMA GIVE IT  TO THE MOST  AMERICAN MOVIE  "ZERO DARK THIRTY"? NO. WOULDN'T WANT TO HON YORT MOVIE  THAT KILLED BIN LAND. HER HUSBAND HAS TO GET ALL THE  CREDIT FOR THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ALL KNOW HOLLYWOOD DOESN'T  REWARD TORTURE FILMS BECAUSE IF  THEY DID, THE WINNER WOULD HAVE BEEN "BATTLESHIP."  NO, NO, LAST NIGHT THE OSCAR  GOES TO --
ARGO, CONGRATULATIONS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: BIG SURPRISE,  HOLLYWOOD HONORS THE FILM WHERE  HOLLYWOOD IS THE HERO. [LAUGHTER] AND, FOLKS, TO HAVE THE FIRST  LADY THAT IS JUST BIG GOVERNMENT  OUT OF CONTROL. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN'T  EVEN BROADCAST ITS OWN CONGRAT  LATOURY STROKE FEST WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERVENGS. WHAT IS NEXT:  HOW MUCH WITH WITH JOAQUI  PHOENIX CAN EAT DURING THE  CEREMONY? A RAMP FOR JENNIFER LAWRENCE? [LAUGHTER] THIS IS JUST BEGINNING. NEXT SUMMER THE MOVIE WILL BE  HARRY REID DRIVING THE SPEED  LIMIT. WRECK IT RAVEL WAS ROBBED. IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE THE  SHOOTING AT SANDY HOOK BUT THE  MEDIA WON'T LET THE STORY GUN  WHERE. THE MEDIA WON'T DROP IT. WHERE IS THE IN-DEPTH REPORTEN  THE SALSA DOG? ♪ ♪  SALSA DOG:  COULD IT HAPPEN IN  YOUR TOWN? [LAUGHTER] THIS MOREID OBSESSION WITH THE  TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  KILLED EVERY YEAR WITH GUNS IS ALL PART OF THE MEDIA'S ANTI-GUN  AGUN AGENDA IT'S AND NOT FUELING  THE NRA PRESIDENT WAYNE "THE PIERRE" LAPIERRE.
THE MEDIA RUSHES TO BLAME  GUNS.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. EVERYONE TIME IS SOMETHING IS  SHOT THE MEDIA RUSHES TO BLAME  GUNS. TO THE MEDIA A SMOKING GUN IS  ALWAYS A SMOKING GUN. SOME JOURNALISTS ARE SO  PREJUDICE AGAINST GUNS THEY'VE  SUNK TO JOURNALISM. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THERE'S NO NATIONAL  DATABUSINESS OF SHOOTINGS  THEY'VE BEEN TALLYING THE SHOOTINGS SINCE NEWTOWN. IT'S MORE THAN 30 A DAY. I KNOW THAT NUMBER SOUNDS HIGH  BUT THERE'S ONLY 28 DAYS IN  FEBRUARY, REMEMBER. [ LAUGHTER ] IN A RECENT POLL 93% OF  AMERICANS FAVOR BACKGROUND  CHECKS. WE CAN'T TRUST THOSE 93%. WE DON'T KNOW THEIR BACKGROUND. [LAUGHTER] LUCKILY WE CAN FIGHT THIS WILL  NEGATIVE REPORTING ABOUT GUNS  AND THAT BRINGS US TOP TONIGHT'S -- BRINGS US TO  TONIGHT'S WORD:  SILENT BUT  DEADLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME OUR  SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS HAVE  BEEN THREATENED BY FACT. IN 1993 THE JACKFOOD STAT  TITIONS AT THE CENTERS FOR  DISEASE CONTROL PUBLISHED A STUDY OF GUN HOUSEHOLDS. NOW, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY NOT  ONLY WERE GUNS INEFFECTIVE IN  HOME PROTECTION BUT PEOPLE WHO KEPT GUNS IN THEIR HOMES  APPEARED TO BE AT GREATEST RISK  OF HOMICIDE THAN PEOPLE WHO DO  NOT. SURE, WITH A GUN IN MY HOUSE MY  FAMILY IS LESS SAFE, BUT ISN'T  THAT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR MY FAMILY'S SAFETY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] BESIDES WHY ON EARTH -- SOMEONE  TELL ME -- WHY IS THE CENTER FOR  DISEASE CONTROL STUDYING GUNS? GUNS AREN'T A DISEASE. I DIDN'T GET MY SEMIAUTOMATIC  FROM SITTING ON A SO TOILET SEAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH DAMAGE THIS  INFORMATION COULD HAVE DONE IF  IT WAS IN THE WRONG HANDS. LUCKILY THE NRA STEPPED UP. IN 1994 THE NRA SUCCESSFULLY  LOBBIED CONGRESS TO KEEP THIS  RESTRICTION IN THE BUDGET.
Stephen: THE NRA MADE THE  GOVERNMENT STOP STUDYING EFFECTS  OF GUNS AND IN THE 17 YEARS SINCE WE'VE REMAINED PERFECTLY  SAFE, AS FAR AS WE KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, YEARS OF  HARD NOT WORK MAY SOON BE UNDONE  BECAUSE WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN OBAMA JUST DIRECTED THE CDC TO  RESUME SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON GUN  VIOLENCE SAYING HE WANTS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM GUNS. [LAUGHTER] NOW, ONCE AGAIN WE'RE FACING OLD  OUR ENEMY FROM THE 90s. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, WE ARE FACING THE  THREAT --  [  APPLAUSE  ] BRSH THE THREAT OF INFORMATION. THANKFULLY PATRIOTS LIKE DAVID  BARTNE RERKS FIGHTING BACK WITH  POSITIVE STORIES OF GUNS IN OUR  SCHOOLS.
GREAT EXAMPLE IN THE 1850'S,  A SCHOOL TEACHER TEACHING A GUY  IN THE WEST. A GUY FROM NEW ENGLAND WANTS TO  KILL HIM AND FIND HIM. HE COMES INTO THE SCHOOL WITH  HIS GUN TO SHOOT THE TEACHER. HE DECIDED NOT TO SHOOT HER  BECAUSE THE KIDS PULLED OUT  THEIR GUNS AND SAID YOU KILL THE TEACH YERK YOU DIE. OKAY. REAL SIM STUFFS.
Stephen: REMEMBER, GUNS ARE  LIKE GUM, YOU HAVE TO BRING  ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE CLASS. [LAUGHTER] THE BLOGOCHATS ARE SAYING HE  LIFTED THAT STORY FROM THE LOUIE  L'AMOUR BENDIGO SHAFTER. IS THAT REALLY A BOOK? IT SOUNDS LOOK A NORTH AMERICAN  PORN STAR. [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN IF HE BORROWED IT FROM A  BOOK THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH  TAKING A STORY FROM A BOOK AND SAYING IT'S REAL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE ONLY THING OUT THERE THAT  CAN STOP A BAD GUY WITH GOOD  INFORMATION ASK A GOOD GUY WITH BAD INFORMATION LIKE NRA  PRESIDENT WAYNE LAPIERRE.
IF A TORNADO HIT, A HURRICANE  HIT, IF A RIDE OCCURS, THEY ARE  OUT THERE ALONE AND THE ONLY WAY THEY ARE GOING TO PROTECT THEM  SELF-IN THE COLD, IN THE DARK,  WHEN THEY ARE VULLER IN IMRABL WITH A FIREARM.
Stephen: YES, IF ONLY  SOMEBODY THREATEN HURRICANE  SANDY WITH A SHOTGUN. THE NORTHEAST WON'T BE IN  THIS -- WOULDN'T BE IN THIS  MESS. [LAUGHTER] TOP COUNTER ALL THE NEGATIVE  STORIES ABOUT GUNS OUT THERE WE  HAVE TO FOLLOW WAYNE AND DAVID AND MAKE UP POSITIVE STORIES  ABOUT GUNS. FOR INSTANCE,:  DID YOU KNOW  THAT FOUR OUT OF FIVE DENTISTS  RECOMMEND THAT YOU OWN A GUN? [LAUGHTER] OR THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN ACTUALLY  DIED FROM --  [LAUGHTER] JOIN ME FROM STANDING UP AGAINST  ANY ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GUNS. LET THE CDC KNOW THEY CAN TAKE  OUR
