Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW, I AM NOT ONE USUALLY TO GET WORKED UP ABOUT DWINDLING RESOURCES BECAUSE I'M ADAPTABLE. IF WE GET LOW ON SPOTTED OWLS I'LL START MAKING MY SANDWICHES WITH SNOWY EGRITS. I MEAN ONCE THEY'RE BREADED THEY ALL TASTE LIKE PANDA. BUT AMERICA IS NOW FACING A DEVASTATING SHORTAGE OF ONE VITAL NATURAL RESOURCE.
THERE IS A MAJOR LIME SHORTAGE.
WE HAVE A LIME SHORTAGE ON OUR HANDS.
LIME SHORTAGE.
LIME SHORTAGE.
LIME SHORTAGE.
Stephen: LIME SHORTAGE! THAT MEANS NO MORE MARGARITAS, NO MOJITOS, THANKFULLY OUR BUD LITE LIME IS SAFE BECAUSE IT IS FLAVORED WITH GRADE PUG-INS. EVEN WORSE-- DAMN WE SHOULD HAVE ONE. EVEN WORSE, WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A NEW SOURCE OF TINY CAT HELMETS. APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY THERE IS A BACTERIA DISEASE KILLING CITRUS TREES CALLED HUONGLONBING WHICH TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IS NOT THE NAME OF MY NEW ASIAN CHARACTER. NO HASHTAGS. BUT-- I'M AFRAID THERE IS AN EVEN MORE SINISTER THREAT TO OUR LIME INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.
IT ALL GOES BACK TO OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH. THE MICHOACAN IS MEXICO'S TOP LIME PRODUCER. AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET MOST OF OUR LIMES FROM. FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. VIOLENCE BETWEEN DRUG CARTELS IN MICHOACAN HAS WRECKED HAVOC ON THE LEMON AND LIME INDUSTRY, SOME CARTELS STEALING A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF LIMES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO WHEN MURDEROUS MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS ARE PEDDLING LIMES. THAT'S LIKE WHAL  WALTER WHITE STOPPING COOKING METH AND COOKING GLUTEN FREE BANANA BREAD. OKAY.
Stephen: THE DRUG CARTELS PUT HUMONGOUS TAXES ON FARMERS OR JUST KILL THE FARMERS AND TAKE OVER LIME PRODUCTION THEMSELVES. SO MOVE OVER BLOOD ORANGES THERE IS A NEW CONFLICT CITRUS. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY VICTIM OF THIS LIME CRIME.
THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER IS REPORTING A CASE OF LIMES IS SELLING FOR $105. THAT'S UP FROM JUST $20 A FEW WEEKS AGO.
LAST YEAR A LIME WAS LESS THAN A QUARTER. NOW WILL YOU PAY ABOUT 53 CENTS.
Stephen: 53 CENTS FOR A LIME? NOW YOU'RE TALKING TANGELO MONEY. (LAUGHTER) SO IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC HAVOC CAUSED BY THE CARTEL SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING THE UNTHINKABLE.
IN SOME CASES RESTAURANTS ARE ALREADY CHOOSING TO MAKE MIXED DRINKS AND EVEN GUACAMOLE WITH LEMONS INSTEAD OF LIME.
Stephen: LEMONS IN MY GUAC? I'M SORRY, BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY HEAD CHOPPED OFF AND STUFFED IN A DUFFEL BAG. FOLKS, THIS CRISIS HITS HOME FOR ME BECAUSE WE ARE COMING UP ON GIN AND TONIC SEASON. I CANNOT EVEN THINK ABOUT HAVING A G AND T WITHOUT LIME, LOOK AT THAT PUTTING THAT PICTURE UP MAKES MY HANDSHAKE. AND I, I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT'S BECAUSE OF LIME WITHDRAWAL. FOLKS, IN MY DESPERATION, I HAVE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO RESORT TO BLACK  MARKET CITRUS, JAY THE INTERN COME ON OUT HERE. JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE)
HEY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: NO NAMES, JAY.
YOU JUST CALLED ME JAY.
Stephen: NO, YOUR CODE NAME IS NOW THE LETTER J.
GOT IT.
Stephen: OKAY. SO YOU'RE JUST BACK FROM MEXICO. HAVE YOU GOT THE PRODUCT.
YES, BUT I COULD ONLY FIT TWO.
Stephen: TWO? WHAT KIND OF LIME MULE ARE YOU? OKAY, FINE. HAND THEM OVER.
THEY HAVEN'T YET ARRIVED. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHAT'S THE HOLDUP, J?
SORRY, THERE'S A BACKLOG AT THE PORT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY, FINE, THEN TAKE THIS CROSSWORD PUZZLE AND DON'T COME OUT UNTIL HAPPY HOUR. OH, OH, OH, OH, AND J, IN A RELATED STORY, THERE'S A LOOMING GRAPEFRUIT SHORTAGE. J, THE INTERN, EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
