EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE SEQUESTER  CONTINUES BUT PAUL RYAN AND THE  PRESIDENT MET TODAY FOR LUNCH TO HAMMER OUT A POSSIBLE DEFICIT  DEAL BEFORE THE LOOMING  CONTINUED BUDGET RESOLUTION VOTE ON MARCH 27. [LAUGHTER] SHUT UP. [LAUGHTER] SHUT UP YOU STUPID BORING NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO  YOU, FOLKS. OLD STEVE WITH A C IS TIRED. IT'S MY LAST SHOW BEFORE A  TWO-WEEK BREAK. I'M BARELY HOLDING IT TOGETHER. CARDS ON THE TABLE I COULD GIVE  TWO (bleep) ABOUT THE NOISE  RIGHT NOW. -- ABOUT THE NEWS RIGHT NOW. NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH 1.5  (bleep) TOPS. YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO TALK  ABOUT? DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I WANT  TO TALK ABOUT? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE  BACHELOR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I LOVE THAT SHOW. I LOVE THAT SHOW. I MEAN I JUST -- EVERY TIME I  WATCH IT IT'S JUST DADDY TIME,  YOU KNOW? I POUR MYSELF A GLASS OF  CHARDONNAY AND I AM OFF TO A  LAND OF ROMANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, LOOK, DON'T BE A HATER  BECAUSE IN 16 SEASONS -- [LAUGHTER] -- 16 SEASONS ONE GUY HAS GOTTEN  MARRIED TO THE RUNNER UP AFTER  HE INITIALLY PROPOSED TO A DIFFERENT GIRL. SO THE SYSTEM WORKS. [ LAUGHTER ] MMMMM, OH. AND HOW GREAT IS SEAN? JIMMY, JIMMY, HOW GREAT IS SEAN? YES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. WHAT GIRL WOULDN'T WANT TO BE  WITH AN ELIGIBLE HUNK WHO HAS A  SUCCESSFUL CAREER AS A CONTESTANT FROM LAST SEASON'S  BACHELORETTE. WHAT WITH HIM BEING A BORN AGAIN  VIRGIN? HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? I'M SORRY BUT ONCE YOU'VE DONE  IT, YOU'VE DONE I. YOU CAN'T  REPOP THE CAP ON A SNAPPLE. I LEARNED THAT ON A SNAPPLE CAP. I GUESS -- I DON'T KNOW -- I  GUESS. AM I RIGHT? I GUESS YOU VOW THE NEXT TIME  YOU DO IT YOU'LL BE TERRIBLE AND  AWKWARD LIKE FLAILING AND PANICKED LIKE A DEER TRAPPED IN  A MINIVAN. GET ME YOU OF -- OUT OF HERE! I HAVE TO ADMIRE HIS MORAL  COMMITMENT TO STAY CHASTE AND  MERELY TONGUE DOWN 20 WOMEN IN ONE NIGHT LIKE GOD INTENDED. I CANNOT WAIT FOR MONDAY'S  FINALE. THE LAST ROSE CEREMONY WAS MOST  DRAMATIC YET. MY FAVORITE PART WAS THE FULL  MINUTE OF EMOTIONALLY CHARGED  STARING. ♪ ♪ [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] ♪ ♪ [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: AFTER SEEING THIS  ARE YOU TELLING ME I CAN RAKE IN  9 MILLION VIEWERS JUST BY STARING AT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE  FOR A WHOLE MINUTE? THEN I KNOW HOW I'M CHOOSING  TONIGHT'S GUEST. PLEASE WELCOME OUR FINALIST NYU  PRESIDENT AND AUTHOR OF  BIRDHOUSE WITHIN DOUGIE ST. JAMES. GENTLEMAN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ONE OF YOU -- ONE OF YOU WILL BE  MY GUEST TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE OTHER -- THE OTHER WILL BE  GOING HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS -- THIS IS SO HARD. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
