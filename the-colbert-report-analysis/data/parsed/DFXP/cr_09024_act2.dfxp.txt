Stephen: WE'RE BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SPEAKER  OF THE HOUSE. PLEASE WELCOME NEWT GINGRICH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. WELL, I'M WANTED TO HAVE YOU ON  FOR YEARS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING  ME TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: WHAT AN HONOR. ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN ON  EARTH!
YOU?
Stephen: YES!
I WANTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU. BUT I UNDERSTAND I'M A DAY LATE.
Stephen: AND A DOLLAR SHORT. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS  SHORT BUT A DAY LATE. BUT I WAS HOPING THAT HAM ROVE  WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO ME  WHAT HAPPENED LAST TUESDAY.
Stephen: MY CAMPAIGN ADVISOR  FOR MY SUPER PAC, HAM ROVE.
YES.
Stephen: WELL, I DON'T KNOW  WHETHER YOU'VE HEARD THE WHOLE  STORY, BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS EATEN BY DOGS. (LAUGHTER)  I LEFT HIM AT THE FLOOR WHERE  THE DOGS COULD GET AT HIM AND  THE DOGS ATE HIM. IT WAS TRAGIC. BUT UNAVOIDABLE.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN I LEARN  HOW OLD DEEPLY SADDENED I WAS AT  NOT HAVING HIS WISDOM.
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE KARL ROVE  WISDOM. IT SEEMS TO BE JUST AS GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, RECENT PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE  HOUSE, WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE YOU  HERE. THANK YOU FOR COMING. SERVED IN CONGRESS FOR 20 YEARS,  ALSO BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF  "GETTYSBURG" "PEARL HARBOR" AND NOW "VICTORY AT YOUR TOWN."  A NOVEL ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON. ARE YOU RETREATING INTO FICTION  BECAUSE REALITY ISN'T THAT GOOD  FOR REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER)  WHY WRITE FICTION ABOUT OUR  HISTORY.
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO  THINK OF HISTORY AS DULL --.
Stephen: YES, ME. (LAUGHTER)
-- TO REALIZE HISTORY IS  ABOUT PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE MAKE  DECISIONS WITH CHALLENGES THEY  FACE, THE TENSIONS THEY LIVE  THROUGH.
Stephen: BUT YOU WROTE THIS  BOOK -- THIS BOOK JUST CAME OUT. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WORKING ON  THIS WHILE YOU WERE RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT.
YES.
Stephen: WERE YOU PHONING IN  THE CAMPAIGN OR PHONING IN THE  BOOK. WHICH IS THE TWO? YOU CAN'T DO TWO THINGS THAT  WELL.
WELL, I DIDN'T. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OH, THAT'S RIGHT,  YOU'RE NOT PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES. WELL SAID. NOW, WHY WASHINGTON FOR YOU. WHAT IS COMPELLING ABOUT THIS  GUY? I MEAN, EVERYBODY'S INTO LINCOLN  RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GOT SPIELBERG'S LINCOLN,  YOU'VE GOOD DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN  LINCOLN, O'RILEY WROTE ABOUT KILLING LINCOLN. WHY IS WASHINGTON YOUR LINCOLN? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, LINCOLN'S VERY, VERY  IMPORTANT AND WELL WORTH  STUDYING BUT THE COUNTRY REST ON WASHINGTON'S SHOULDERS. THE NATURE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS,  THE CORE OF OUR GOVERNING  CULTURE. LITERALLY THE WINNING OF THE  REVOLUTIONARY WAR. AND THIS IS GUY WHO PEOPLE  TRUSTED SO DEEPLY THAT YOU  LITERALLY COULD ARGUE THEY BUILT AMERICA AROUND HIS CHARACTER AND  HIS REPUTATION.
WHY DIDN'T HE GO FOR KING? HE COULD HAVE BEEN, RIGHT? HE COULD HAVE BEEN KING IF HE  WANTED TO.
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT. WHEN HIS OFFICERS CAME TO HIM  AFTER THEY WON THE WAR AND SAID  THIS IS OUR CHANCE, WHY DON'T WE MARCH ON CONGRESS? WASHINGTON CAME TO SEE THEM IN A  SCHOOL ROOM AND HE TOOK OUT HIS  GLASSES AND PUT THEM ON TO REMIND THEM HE'D GROWN OLD IN  THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY AND  HE READ THEM A BRIEF LETTER THAT SAID "WE DID NOT REBEL AGAINST  GEORGE III FOR ME TO BECOME  GEORGE I. AND IF I WERE TO DO THAT I WOULD  BETRAY EVERY SINGLE THING WE  FOUGHT FOR. AND I THINK BOOKS LIKE THIS HELP  CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE  TO SAY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN AND  THIS IS WHY WE'RE THE ONLY  COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY, YOU CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET  AND YOU CAN LEARN TO BE AN  AMERICAN. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD  THAT CAPACITY.
Stephen: OR YOU COULD COME  FROM OUR 51st STATE, THE MOON  BASE. (LAUGHTER)
I JUST WANT TO SAY AT SOME  POINT IN THE FUTURE, HOPEFULLY  BY THE TIME MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE, WE WILL BE BACK ON THE  MOON, YOU'LL BROADCAST FROM  THERE, IT WILL BE NO MORE STRANGE THAN IT IS BROADCASTING  FROM HERE, BUT IT WILL BE  EXCITING AND YOU'LL LIKE IT.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU FOR  REASSURING ME. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE  BREAK, COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN A BIT, OKAY? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SPEAKER  GOING RIFF. STICK AROUND. (CHEERS AND A
