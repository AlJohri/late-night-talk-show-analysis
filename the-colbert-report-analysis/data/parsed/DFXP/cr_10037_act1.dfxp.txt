Stephen: TONIGHT, HOW BIG IS THE N.S.A. SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM? AND AM I BEING RECORDED RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER) THEN, WILL I RECEIVE A NOBEL R DID I EAT THOSE JACKER CRACKER JACKS FOR NOTHING? (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST IS THE FOUNDER OF BUZZFEED. I'LL TALK TO HIM FOR ONE MINUTE BEFORE LOSING INTEREST AND CLICKING ON ANOTHER GUEST. (LAUGHTER) A NEW STUDY CLAIMS A.D.D. IS OVERDIAGNOSED-- OR SOMETHING, I GOT BORED AND DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." HELLO! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") HELLO! WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, YOU KNOW IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE GOOGLE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE YAHOO! OF THINGS THAT WORK. (LAUGHTER) BUT OVER THE WEEKEND, FOLKS, GOOGLE BOUGHT THEMSELVES A DISTURBING EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
GOOGLE'S LATEST PURCHASE IS RAISING SOME EYEBROWS. THE COMPANY HAS BOUGHT BOSTON DYNAMICS, AN ENGINEERING COMPANY THAT DESIGNS ROBOTS THAT CAN JUMP, WALK, AND RUN. THIS IS.
THIS IS THE EIGHTH COMPANY THAT PEOPLE HAVE BAHT IN THE ROBOTICS FIELD.
THESE DEVICES WERE BUILT FOR THE MILITARY. WHAT COULD GOOGLE WANT WITH THEM?
Stephen: CLEARLY TO ENSLAVE HUMANITY. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET US TO SIGN UP FOR GOOGLE+. (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, THESE ARE FORMIDABLE ROBOTS. THERE'S WILD CAT, A GALLOPING QUADRUPED THAT RUNS ON GASOLINE AND YOUR NIGHTMARES. (LAUGHTER) SAND FLEA, WHICH CAN LEAP TO THE TOP OF A TWO-STORY BUILDING IN THE RARE EVENT YOU SOMEHOW ESCAPE WILD CAT. BIG DOG, MADE TO ASSIST HUMANS IN THE VITAL TASK OF HURLING CINDER BLOCKS. PET MAN WHICH NO DOUBT ONE DAY WILL MAKE A PET OUT OF MAN. AND, OF COURSE, CHEETAH, A BLADE-LEGGED CYBER BEAST WITH A TOP SPEED OF OVER 28 MILES PER HOUR-- WHICH IS FASTER THAN USAIN BOLT. SO THERE GOES MY PLAN TO FLEE THESE ROBOTS ON BOLTBACK. (LAUGHTER) SO, FOLKS, TONIGHT -- FOLKS, TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO SAY I'M ANNOUNCING THE FORMATION OF A REBEL ALLIANCE TO DEFEND HUMANITY. AFTER ALL, THESE THINGS ARE JUST LIKE IMPERIAL WALKERS. WE ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DEFEAT THOSE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I HAVE STARTED AN EWOK BREEDING PROGRAM. (AUDIENCE REACTS) UH-HUH, UH-HUH. (LAUGHTER) YES. MY FIRST GOAL: S TO GET THIS EWOK TO STOP POOPING IN MY HOUSE. YES, YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN TO CATCH CINDER BLOCKS. THROW ME A CINDER BLOCK! THROW ME A CINDER BLOCK! BUT, OF COURSE, SOME TECHNOLOGY IS OUR FRIEND. LIKE THE KIND USED BY THE N.S.A. WHICH HAS BEEN ROCKED BY THAT CERTIFIED NUT-LID EDWARD SNOWDEN. AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW BAD IT IS BECAUSE OFFICIALS HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH INFORMATION HE HAS COLLECTED. THAT'S RIGHT. THE EXTENT OF EDWARD SNOWDEN'S LEAKS ARE AS FUZZY AND AS ILL-DEFINED AS HIS MUSTACHE. (LAUGHTER) SO IN A DESPERATE BID TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH INTEL SNOWDEN TOOK, N.S.A. OFFICIALS RECENTLY FLOATED THE IDEA OF OFFERING EDWARD SNOWDEN AMNESTY. I'D TAKE THE DEAL, ED. JUST COME BACK WITH ALL THE INTEL AND ALL IS FORGIVEN. I TELL YOU WHAT, TO MAKE YOU FEEL SAFE WE'LL MEET YOU IN A SPECIAL AMNESTY ZONE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THE N.S.A. IS JUST DOING THEIR JOB! AND THEY'RE JUST DOING IT IN MORE PLACES THAN YOU EVER IMAGINED.
THE N.S.A. ACTIVITY DIDN'T STOP WITH E-MAILS OR CELL PHONES OF FOREIGN LEADERS ACCORDING THE GUARDIAN AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES" WHICH SAY THE AGENCY ALSO SPIED ON VIDEO GAMES LIKE WORLD OF WAR CRAFT AND SECOND LIFE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE N.S.A. IS SPYING ON SECOND LIFE-- A GAME FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A FIRST ONE. (LAUGHTER) AND THANK GOD THEY ARE. THE N.S.A. KNOWS THAT ONLINE GAMES ARE A TARGET-RICH COMMUNICATION NETWORK ALLOWING INTELLIGENT SUSPECTS A WAY TO HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT. AND ONE N.S.A. WORKER DESCRIBED ONLINE GAMES AS "AN OPPORTUNITY" TO GET HIS DWARF ROGUE UP TO LEVEL 9. (LAUGHTER) SO THE N.S.A. WENT UNDERCOVER IN THESE VIRTUAL WORLDS WITH MAKE-BELIEVE CHARACTERS TO SNOOP AND TRY TO RECRUIT INFORMERS. IN FACT, SO MANY DIFFERENT U.S. INTELLIGENCE AGENTS WERE CONDUCTING OPERATIONS INSIDE GAMES THAT A DECONFLICTION GROUP WAS REQUIRED TO ENSURING THEY WEREN'T SPYING ON OR INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER. (LAUGHTER) AS SEEN IN THIS RECENTLY-LEAKED FOOTAGE.
NICE, NEW.
TOTALLY. SO YOU WANT TO BLOW UP A BRIDGE?
I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU?
ONLY IF YOU DO.
WAIT, AGENT KINCAID?
AGENT PAT -R SON?
HANG ON. IS EVERYONE HERE FROM THE N.S.A.?
YUP.
UH-HUH.
SURE AM.
ME, TOO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND, FOLKS, THEIR VIRTUAL HARD WORK HAS VIRTUALLY PAID OFF BECAUSE THE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN NO INDICATION THAT THE SURVEILLANCE EVER FOILED ANY TERRORIST PLOTS, NOR IS THERE ANY CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT TERROR GROUPS WERE USING THE VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES TO COMMUNICATE AS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES PREDICTED. SO NO TERRORISTS IN WORLD OF WAR CRAFT, WHICH MEANS THEY MUST HAVE MOVED ON TO MADDEN 25. BUT FOLKS, ALL THIS MOANING ABOUT N.S.A. SNOOPING TOTALLY IGNORES THE GREAT SNOOPING BEING DONE BY THE F.B.I. THE FEDS HAVE UNVEILED THEIR GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH SINCE WHATEVER THEY USED TO KEEP MULDER AND SCULLY FROM DOING IT. THEY WERE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER! PRINT MY FAN FICTION! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JIM?
OUR GOVERNMENT HAS HAD THE ABILITY TO TURN ON OUR WEB CAMS ON OUR COMPUTERS AND MONITOR US AT HOME AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.
THE FEDS ARE REPORTEDLY ABLE TO USE SECRET TECHNOLOGY TO DISABLE THE WEB CAM'S GREEN LIGHT SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU'RE ON. A SOURCE TELLS THE "WASHINGTON POST" THAT THE F.B.I. HAS BEEN ABLE TO HACK INTO OUR WEB CAMS FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH. PREVIOUSLY IF YOU WANTED TO SPY ON SOMEONE THROUGH YOUR WEB CAM YOU HAD TO PAY $1.99 PER MINUTE. (LAUGHTER) AND WHAT THEY WERE STRAPPING ON WAS NOT A SUICIDE VEST. (AUDIENCE REACTS) STILL, THERE MIGHT BE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T WANT A NAMELESS BUREAUCRAT TO WATCH YOUR EVERY MOVE. THAT'S WHY I HAVE INVENTED A POWERFUL NEW ANTI-SURVEILLANCE SECURITY SYSTEM CALLED TOTAL ANALOG PERSONAL ENCRYPTION. OR TAP-PAY. HERE IS THE PROTOTYPE, OKAY? (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, FOR JUST THREE EASY PAYMENTS OF 12 EASY PAYMENTS AT $59.99 YOU CAN UP LOG THE SYSTEM OVER YOUR WEB CAM'S LENS, ALL RIGHT? AND THE PATENTED QUAD CORNER OPACITY WILL JAM THE F.B.I.'S OPTICAL SIGNALS. AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE OFF THE GRID YOU CAN USE IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU CAN USE IT TO ENCRYPT PACKAGES AND WINDOW CRACKS. SO GET YOURS TODAY BUT REMEMBER THE OFFER IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR TERRORISTS. YOU'RE ON YOUR HONOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
