[CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE COLBERT NATION MARCH IS ON THE VICTORY AGAIN TONIGHT. FOLKS IT IS NIGHT TWO OF MY COVERAGE WHAT FOR LEGAL REASONS I'M CALLING SUPERB OWL 48. THE SAME WAY I COVER HOCKEY'S CHAMPIONSHIP, THE STAN LEE CUP. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS WE ALL KNOW FOOTBALL'S AMERICA'S SPORT BUT MY BELOVED GRIDIRON IS UNDER ATTACK.
ROGER GOODELL SAID THE LEAGUE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ELIMINATE EXTRA POINTS.
WHY ARE WE DEBATING THE MERITS OF THE EXTRA POINTS.
AN EXAMPLE OF THE NFL CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES. THEY'VE GOT TO CHANGE EVERY F-ING YEAR.
Stephen:  YES, EVERY F-ING YEAR. FIRST THEY CHANGED THE FIELD GOAL FROM 4 POINTS TO 3 POINTS IN 1909. AND NOW THIS. WHEN WILL IT END. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS IT'S NOT JUST THE EXTRA POINTS. THERE'S TALK THE KICK OFF WILL EVENTUALLY BE ELIMINATED. COME ON, HOW CAN YOU, I AGREE, HOW CAN YOU EVEN CALL IT FOOTBALL IF NOBODY TOUCHES THE BALL WITH THEIR FOOT. [APPLAUSE] THAT IS LIKE -- THAT'S LIKE SUBWAY CALLING THEIR SANDWICH A FOOT LONG IF THEY DIDN'T USE THEIR FEET TO MAKE IT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, PLACE KICKER WAS THE LAST NFL POSITION AVAILABLE TO LUMPY MIDDLE-AGED WHITE GUYS. LUCKILY THERE STILL MIGHT BE A PLACE FOR ME. CHAMPIONSHIP QUARTERBACK. I MEAN HOW HARD COULD IT BE. YOU PUT YOUR HANDS BETWEEN SOME GUY'S LEGS AND SCREAM. WELCOME TO MY DAILY STAFF MEETING. MEETING. [LAUGHTER] SO FOLKS JUST IN CASE I EVER LOSE THIS JOB RIGHT HERE I SET OUT TO LEARN THE SECRETS OF CORPORATE BACKARY IN THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S FALL BACK POSITION. I BEGAN MY QUEST WITH LEGENDARY WASHINGTON REDSKINS COACH JOE GIBBS. FOUR NFC CHAMPIONSHIPS. THREE SUPER BOWLS. I WAS EAGER TO SHOW OFF  MY RAW ATHLETICISM. COACH THANKS FOR TALKING WITH ME TODAY, IT'S A REAL HONOR.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
COACH JOE GIBBS. BROADWAY JOE.
THAT WAS ANOTHER GUY.
SO YOU'RE NOT BROADWAY JOE. WAS BROADWAY JOE NOT AVAILABLE. [LAUGHTER] DID HE CALL? THIS IS A WASTE OF THIS GOOD MAN'S TIME. WELL ONCE AGAIN, WHAT AN HONOR.
I CAN TELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I CAN TELL.
OBVIOUSLY A LEGEND IN THE GAME OF FOOTBALL IF I MAY CALL IT THAT. BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR TIME THESE DAYS.
MOSTLY A LOT OF IT'S MINISTRIES AND RACING CARS.
DO YOU DO THOSE TOGETHER. DO YOU HAVE A MINISTER IN A RACE CAR.
NO.
WHAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR MINISTRY.
GAME PLAYER FOR LIFE.COM, THEY CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING. GOD'S OUR HEAD COACH AND WE'RE PLAYING THE BIGGEST GAME OF ALL. AND AN ALL POWERFUL COACH WOULD HAVE A GOOD GAME PLAN.
YOU HAVE THREE SUPER BOWL RINGS. THAT'S PART OF GOD'S PLAN. CHUCK NOEL HAS FOUR SUPER BOWL RINGS. GOD LIKES CHUCK NOEL MORE THAN YOU.
HE DOES A BETTER JOB THAN I DID.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?
YES.
I'M A REDSKINS FAN BORN IN WASHINGTON DC, OBVIOUSLY YOUR HEYDAY, FANTASTIC TIME. JOHN RIGGENS, SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, JOHN G. MARSHALL. WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO COACH THAT TEAM IN THE 80'S.
IT WAS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCES. IT'S THE GREATEST TOWN TO COACH IN. I THINK IT'S THE GREATEST SPORTS FRANCHISE IN THE WORLD.
THREE SUPER BOWL VICTORIES. HUGE DEAL.
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE GREATEST THING THAT MAN COULD CREATE IN A SUPER BOWL.
MOVEABLE PRINT. THE PYRAMID OF GIZA AND THE SUPER GOAL. NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER. [APPLAUSE] I HAVE A DREAM, ALL RIGHT. I'VE ALREADY GOT MY EMMY, I'VE GOT MY GRAMMY AND MY  PEADBODY AWARD. I GOT THE COVETED WEBBY AWARD. WHAT I REALLY WANT IS THE SUPER BOWL RING. YOU HAVE THREE SUPER BOWL RINGS. CAN I SEE ONE OF THEM.
YES, GRAB ONE HERE. TAKE A LOOK.
TELL YOU WHAT, YOU LET ME KEEP THIS RING AND WE'RE KIND OF DONE. I GOT WHAT I WANTED.
IT TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO GET THAT.
NOT REALLY. I ASKED YOU FOR THIS AND YOU GAVE IT TO ME. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] WOW THAT'S NICE. MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIG. HOLD ON.
THAT ONE GOT AWAY.
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE FINE. [LAUGHTER]
LET'S GO BACK TO A GREAT NFL PLAYER.
I WANT THE MOST ATTENTION, THE MOST MONEY AND THE MOST SUPER MODELS WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL CONTACT. YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO PLAY QUARTERBACK, YOU GET HIT BACK THERE. YOU DO GET HIT.
REALLY.
MOST GUYS THAT MAKE IT START WHEN THEY'RE FIVE, WORK HARD OF IT. I DON'T SEE A LOT HERE.
OH. I'M ALWAYS WORKING THE CORE. I DO A FAIR AMOUNT OF HOT YOGA. I GO THROUGH MY FLOW AND I PLAY A FAIR AMOUNT OF HACKY SACK.
IT GETS A LOT OF PEOPLE. I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT GOING IN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK MY CHANCES ARE OF BEING ON THE FIELD ON SURE BOWL SUNDAY?
I THINK YOU GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE.
OKAY GREAT. YOU READY TO DO THIS MAN.
I'M READY.
COME ON. BOOM. FIRST, I HAD TO LEARN HOW TO QUARTER BACK FROM THIS GUY, STEVE CLARKESON, THE DREAM MAKER. HE'S TRAINED OVER 75 QUARTERBACKS INCLUDING BEN ROTHSBERGER, TIM TEBOW AND STEPHEN COLBERT. STEVE, MAY I CALL YOU STEVE.
YES.
STEVE, MAY I CALL YOU STEVE.
YES.
I ALWAYS CHECK TWICE. COACH, WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A GOOD QB.
THE ABILITY TO OWN THE ROOM.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU CAN BASICALLY PEOPLE KNOW YOU'RE THERE WITHOUT YOU SAYING ANYTHING. ANYTHING.
IT'S STEVEN COLBERT. WHAT ELSE.
THE FIRST THING BEFORE YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO THROW THE BALL, YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO HOLD THE FOOTBALL. [LAUGHTER] GRAB THE BALL. MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT THE GRIP. FIRST LESSON, YOU MUST MAINTAIN POSSESSION OF THE BALL.
I DID HAVE IT. I DID HAVE THE BALL. YOU SLAPPED IT OUT OF MY HAS NOT.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE GAME.
PEOPLE WALK UP AND SLAP THE BALL OUT OF MY HAND.
DO YOU WANT TO OWN THE ROOM.
I OWN THE ROOM.
NO YOU DON'T. DO YOU WANT TO THROW THE BALL. YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD THE BALL. YOUR BALANCE IS OFF.
I HAPPEN TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT WEARING A CUP.
IT TELLS ME YOU DON'T HAVE TESTICLES. [LAUGHTER]
HERE IS A DRILL THAT'S GOING TO HELP YOU FEEL THE RUSH. AS A QUARTERBACK YOU DON'T WANT TO SEAT RUSH, YOU JUST WANT TO FEEL IT.
SHOULDN'T WE ESTABLISH A SAFE WORD FIRST.
THERE'S NO SAFE WORD.
A PUMPKIN PATCH.
GO. COME ON COME ON. GET UP IN IT. COME ON, BOY. PUMPKIN PATCH. YOU GOT TO SHOW EVERYBODY YOU OWN THE ROOM. IT'S CALLED THE QUARTERBACK WALK. PRACTICE. YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR TEAMMATE. YOU GOT THIS, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SHOW ME A QUARTERBACK WALK.
LET'S DO IT.
LET'S GO. [LAUGHTER]
ISN'T THAT RIGHT. THERE'S MUCH MORE TO COME.
THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] TAKE THE WEST SIDE, WEST SIDE STORY. [APPLAUSE]
TUNE IN NEXT TIME WHEN I OWN THE ROOM FOR COACH GIBBS. I CANNOT WORK LIKE THIS. WITH NFL GREATS ISAAC BRUCE AND GERALD MCCOY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING.
THIS IS THE FOOTBALL.
ON STEPHEN COLBERT'S FALL BACK POSITION
