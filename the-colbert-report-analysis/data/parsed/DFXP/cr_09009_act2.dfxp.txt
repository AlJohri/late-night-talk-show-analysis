Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, WHOEVER COINED THE  PHRASE AS FUN AS A BAREL OF  MONKEYS NEVER HAD TO HOSE  OUT A 50 GALLON DRUM OF BONOBO FILTH. THIS IS MONKEY ON THE LAM. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NATION, FOR  SEVEN YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN  BRINGING YOU THE LATEST IN  BREAKING MONKEY FUGITIVE  NEWS. THAT THE COW ARDS IN THE  LEMUR STREAM MEDIA WON'T  TOUCH. NOW I DON'T DO IT FOR THE  PEABODY'S, THOUGH IT IS NICE  WHEN SOMEBODY ACKNOWLEDGES  YOUR WORK. NO, I DO IT BECAUSE I'M  LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. MY HIRE PRI MATE VIEWERS. AND YOU MIGHT REMEMBER BACK  IN MARCH OF 2010 DURING WHAT  MANY CALL THE SPRING OF THE  MONDAY QUI, I BLEW THE LID OFF THE STORY OF A RAMPAGING  MACK QIA.
TONIGHT A LONG DOVER DUE  WARNING OF THE RES DENS OF  SYNTH PETERSBURG FLORIDA  WHERE LAST NIGHT THEY SPOTTED A RHESUS MACK QIA  MONDAY QUI THAT ELUDED  AUTHORITY FORCE OVER A YEAR. SO CITIZENS OF FLORIDA YOU  MUST CATCH THIS MONKEY  BEFORE SPRING BREAK BECAUSE  WHILE GIRLS MAY GO WILD, MONKEYS ON THE LAM GO APE [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)  NOW I KNOW, SICK STUFF. BUT DON'T WORRY, MONKEY GOES  APE [BLEEP] SHOWS UP ON YOUR  CREDIT CARD STATEMENT AS  BANANA MAINTENANCE. NOW BUT WHEN I SOUNDED THE  APE ALARM TWO AND A HALF  YEARS AGO, NO ONE IN ST. PETERSBERG LISTENED. AND TODAY THIS MONKEY MANIAC  IS STILL HE LUTEDING THE  LONG HARRY ARM OF THE LAW.
THE SEARCH IS ON FOR THE  MYSTERY MONKEY OF ST. PETERSBURG.
NOT TOO MUCH TRAFFIC. NICE TALL TREES. REALLY IS THE KIND OF PLACE  WHERE A MONKEY COULD MAKE A  HOME. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT  HAPPENED IN THIS  NEIGHBORHOOD. THE MYSTERY MONKEY SETTLED  DOWN HERE, GOT COMFORTABLE. THE WILDLIFE EXPERTS SAY  MAYBE A LITTLE TOO  COMFORTABLE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'RE CALLING IT THE  MYSTERY MONKEY. INSTEAD OF CATCHING THE  SIMIAN PSYCHO THEY GAVE HIM  A NICK NAME. AND WORSE THE NICK NAME  WASN'T SIMIAN PSYCHO. NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO  WITH ALL THESE T-SHIRTS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, THE PEOPLE OF ST. PETERSBERG HAVE IGNORED MY  SELF-LESS ATTEMPT TO MACAQUE  BLOWSOM. AND NOW THIS MONKEY HAS COME  BACK TO BITE THEM,  LITERALLY. THE RHESUS MACK QIA HAS  BITTEN SOMEONE IN THE AREA  OF BOYD HILL NATURE PARK, AN  ELDERLY WOMAN.
I DON'T THINK IT WAS AN  ATTACK. I THINK THE MONKEY JUMPS ON  HER BACK, BOTH FREAKED OUT.
Stephen: SURE, YEAH. (LAUGHTER)  SURE, NOT REALLY AN ATTACK. BOTH SIDES FREAKED OUT. I MEAN AT THIS POINT WHO  KNOWS WHO STARTED IT. MAYBE THE OLD LADY JUMPED  OUT OF THE TREE. NATION, GIVE THEN MONKEY'S  LATEST ACTIONS WE NEED TO  UPDATE OUR GRAPHIC. THIS IS MONDAY QUI ON THE  GRAM.
Stephen: FOLKS, WE CANNOT  LET THIS MONKEY GO AROUND  MALLING INNOCENT SENIORS. UNLESS THAT'S A SOCIAL  SECURITY PLAN MITT ROMNEY IS  NOT TELLING US ABOUT. WE'LL BE RIG
