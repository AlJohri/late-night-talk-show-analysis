[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORLD OF SPORTS, EVERYBODY ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT THE THRILL OF VICTORY AND THE AGONY OF DEFEAT, BUT NOBODY EVER MENTIONS THE "MEH" OF A TIE. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FIRST UP, FIRST UP, NATION, I LOVE WATCHING FOOTBALL, OR  IF FOOTBALL'S NOT AVAILABLE, THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS, A TEAM THAT'S WON ONLY 11 GAMES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS BUT HAS A BOLD NEW PLAN TO PUT BUTTS IN THE SEATS BY TAKING OUT THE SEATS.
THE JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS' FANS WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH GAMES THIS SEASON SITTING IN A SWIMMING POOL WHILE THE TEAM WAS UPGRADING THE STADIUM. THEY HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.
THEY ADDED TWO POOLS ALONG WITH 16 CABANAS.
Stephen: YES, POOLS, THE PERFECT PLACE TO KICK BACK AND WATCH A FOOTBALL GAME, AT LEAST UNTIL THEY PUT HAMMOCKS BETWEEN THE UPRIGHTS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING HIT BY FIELD GOALS, BECAUSE AGAIN, IT'S THE JAGUARS. NOW, THE CABANA PACKAGE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A LOT OF JAGUAR FANS HERE TONIGHT. THE CABANA PACKAGE COSTS A MERE $12,500 PER GAME, INCLUDES 50 TICKETS AND IS ALL YOU CAN EAT AND DRINK, OF COURSE, YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR AFTER EATING BEFORE GETTING INTO THE POOL, BUT ONCE YOU DO, DRINK ALL THE BEER YOU WANT BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE BATHROOM. NATURALLY THIS BOLD PLAN RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS, LIKE WHY? AND REALLY, WHY? THE TEAM'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF SALES EXPLAINS, WE WANTED TO TAKE AREAS IN OUR STADIUM THAT WERE UNDERPERFORMING AND GET CREATIVE. POOLS ARE A GOOD START, BUT THEY SHOULD ALSO TACKLE THE STADIUM'S MOST UNDERPERFORMING AREA, THAT GREEN LINEY SPACE IN THE MIDDLE. LET'S GET CREATIVE IN THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE, MAYBE PUT A PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TEAM ON THAT THING. AND THE NEW PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST HD LED VIDEO SCREENS, WHICH WILL BE SHOWING A CONSTANT STREAM OF THE NFL RED ZONE FEED, SO FANS CAN WATCH THE JAGUARS WHILE KEEPING UP WITH THE REST OF THE LEAGUE OR TRACKING THEIR FANTASY TEAM. WHICH FOR JAGUAR FANS IS ANY OTHER TEAM. [LAUGHTER] NEXT UP ON THE SPORT REPORT, HOCKEY. OR AS SOME CALL IT, ICE SOCCER. OR AS I CALL IT, COLD BORING. [LAUGHTER] THE NEW YORK RANGERS AND THE L.A. KINGS ARE BATTLING IT OUT IN THE STANLEY CUP FINALS. AS ALWAYS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH. AS ALWAYS, MY MONEY'S ON THE CANADIAN TEAM, BUT THE REAL COMPETITION HERE IS BETWEEN THE GOVERNORS WHO TRADITIONALLY BET SOMETHING FROM THE TEAM'S HOME STATE. IN THIS CASE, IT'S CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN VERSUS NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO. AND THEY GOT A LOT RIDING ON THIS SERIES.
IF THE RANGERS CELEBRATE LIKE THEY DID IN THE LAST ROUND, CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WILL SEND ANDREW CUOMO A BOX OF ORGANIC CALIFORNIA RACE CAKES.
Stephen: AND BOOM GO THE RICE CAKES. NEW YORK COULD WIN,  A WHOLE BOX OF ORGANIC RICE CAKES AND FOR FLAVOR, GOVERNOR  BROWN IS MAILING IT IN A BOX FILLED WITH DELICIOUS PACKING  PEANUTS. I FOR ONE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S CHOICE OF ORGANIC  RICE CAKES. THE ONLY THING MORE STEREOTYPICALLY JERRY BROWN CALIFORNIA HE COULD HAVE WAGERED WOULD HAVE BEEN A WIND CHIME MADE OUT OF RECYCLED ONE-HITTERS. BUT THE STAKES, FOLKS, THE STAKES GET EVEN HIGHER IF NEW YORK LOSES.
IF THE KINGS WIN, BROWN WILL GET A COMMEMORATIVE HOCKEY PUCK CELEBRATING NEW YORK'S THREE CONSECUTIVE ON-TIME BUDGETS.
Stephen:, NO, NO WE CAN'T LOSE NEW YORK'S LEGENDARY THREE-ON-TIME BUDGET HOCKEY  PUCK WHICH WAS COMMISSIONED BY GOVERNOR CUOMO IN 2013 TO COMMEMORATE HIS HAT TRICK OF FULFILLING THE BASIC OBLIGATIONS OF HIS OFFICE. IT'S OUR PROUDEST TROPHY OF GOVERNMENTAL SELF-CONGRATULATION SINCE GOVERNOR AL SMITH'S "WE HAVE PAVED ROADS" BASEBALL BAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AT LEAST WE CAN TAKE SOME COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT GOVERNOR CUOMO IS STILL FIRMLY IN POSSESSION OF THE BASEBALL THAT COMMEMORATES THIS YEAR'S GRAND SLAM FOURTH ON-TIME BUDGET. ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT A BASEBALL HAS DO WITH THE BUDGET. IT'S NOT A PUCK. [LAUGHTER] THINK, THINK IF YOU CAN, THINK OF WHAT THE LOSS OF THIS PUCK WOULD MEAN TO NEW YORK'S TOURISM INDUSTRY. MILLIONS HAVE COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO MARVEL AT OUR THREE ON-TIME BUDGETS. IT'S EVEN IN OUR SONG.
