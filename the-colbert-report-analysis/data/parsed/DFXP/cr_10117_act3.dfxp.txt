Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS INVENTED A  DRINK HE SAYS CAN REPLACE THE NEED FOR FOOD. WE ALREADY HAVE THAT. IT'S CALLED BEER. PLEASE WELCOME, ROB RHINEHART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING  ON. YOU'RE THE CULINARY MAN OF THE  HOUR. YOU'RE A 25-YEAR-OLD CEO OF  SOYLENT THAT MANUFACTURES FOOD  PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO BE  NUTRITIONALLY COMPLETE. AS OF THE LATEST REPORTS, YOU HAVE  $10,000 IN NEW ORDERS COMING IN  EVERY DAY. LET'S LOOK AT THE STUFF. HERE'S A POUCH. IT'S CALLED SOYLENT AND IT'S A  POWDER, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: AND IT'S AN OIL  BLEND THAT GOES WITH IT.
THE BODY NEEDS IT AS WELL.
Stephen: WHY JUST NOT EAT  FOOD? AMERICANS ARE NOT LACKING IN  FOOD.
AMERICANS ARE NOT LACKING IN  CALORIES, THEY'RE LACKING IN BALANCE AND AMERICANS HAVE A HIGH DEMAND FOR CONVENIENCE. THE FOOD IS VERY CONVENIENT,  NUTRITIOUS AND AFFORDABLE IT FITS THE CRITERIA PEOPLE DESIRE IN THEIR STAPLE FOODS.
Stephen: OK, HERE IT IS. YOU MADE THIS UP FOR  US. THERE IT IS. WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR  THIS? DID YOU SEE SOMEONE IN A COMA  WITH A FEEDING TUBE AND YOU  THOUGHT I'LL HAVE WHAT HE'S  HAVING?
I FOUND MYSELF FRUSTRATED IN MY OWN LIFE, I WAS EATING VERY POORLY.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
WORKING FOR A TECH COMPANY, I WAS WORKING HARD AND ENJOYED MY  WORK AND WORKING ON COMPLEX  PRODUCTS IN WIRELESS  COMMUNICATION AND FOOD WAS A  HUGE BURDEN. GOING TO THE   GROCERY STORE AND COOKING AND CLEANING AND DOING DISHES AND DOING THE SAME WORK OVER AND OVER, AND I WAS EATING POORLY I THOUGHT WHY CAN'T WE OPTIMIZE IT? WHAT IF WE MADE IT MORE EFFICIENT? WHAT IF WE DECONSTRUCTED FOOD AND  GOT DOWN TO THE CORE, THE REAL PURPOSE AND BALANCED IT AHEAD OF TIME BASED ON MODERN INFORMATION OF  NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY AND TRY TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AND HEALTHY AND AFFORDABLE AS POSSIBLE?
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL MAKE AN EXCELLENT MAITRE D. LET'S TRY A LITTLE BIT OF THIS STUFF. A LITTLE BIT OF THIS, OK. THERE YOU GO. NOW, IS THIS A SUPPLEMENT OR IS THIS MY MEAL?
THIS IS A FOOD. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU BODY  NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY. YOU CAN LIVE ON IT ENTIRELY IF YOU SO DESIRED.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU  BEEN LIVING ON THIS?
IT'S BEEN THE PRIMARY COMPONENT, ABOUT 90% OF MY DIET   FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.
Stephen: FOR THE LAST YEAR  AND A HALF YOU'VE BEEN LIVING  OFF A PRIMARILY LIQUID DIET. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU FORMED A STOOL, MY FRIEND?
IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL. AS FAR AS THE BODY'S CONCERNED  YOU'RE CONSUMING A TRADITIONALLY WELL BALANCED DIET. IN FACT THIS HAS THE FULL AMOUNT OF FIBER THAT NOBODY IN AMERICA'S GETTING. SO IT'S QUITE REGULAR.
Stephen: SHALL WE? HOLD ON, I'M GETTING NOTES OF -- A LITTLE VANILLA-Y KIND OF TASTE IS THERE FLAVOR IN HERE?
THERE'S VERY MINIMAL FLAVOR. IT'S DESIGNED TO BE VERY BROAD,  VERY NONSPECIFIC SO YOU DON'T GET TIRED OF CONSUMING IT
Stephen: AGAIN, YOU HAD ME AT NONSPECIFIC. YES, OKAY. SO --
OKAY. HAVE I RUINED IT OR MADE IT  BETTER?
IF YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE I THINK YOU MADE IT BETTER. IT'S A STAPLE LIKE FLOUR. I EXPECT IT TO BE A COMPONENT OF ALL DIFFERENT FOODS STUFFS.
Stephen: THIS IS USED A LOT BY CODERS, I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE  THEIR TERMINAL WHILE THEY'RE  CODING.
IT'S USED BY SORTS OF  PEOPLE. PEOPLE CAN FIT IT IN THEIR  LIFESTYLE HOWEVER THEY SEE FIT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEND MORE TIME CODING YOU CAN USE IT AND I THINK IT'S GREAT PEOPLE CAN  SPEND MORE TIME FOR LEISURE   ACTIVITIES, RELAXING. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AND COMPLEXITY AND STRESS THAT GOES INTO FOOD.
Stephen: BUT THERE'S ALSO PLEASURE. FOOD IS PLEASURABLE LIKE MELTED CHEESE, MY FRIEND. THIS IS AMERICA. MELTED CHEESE.
I DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO GIVE UP CHEESE DIP. BUT YOU WOULDN'T LIVE VERY LONG ON  CHEESE DIP.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU'D LIVE  AMERICAN-STYLE. SO HOW MANY OF THESE DO I DRINK A DAY?
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY THIS IS ABOUT 2,000 CALORIES.
Stephen: THIS WHOLE JUG IS 2,000 CALORIES? HOW MUCH IS IT COSTING ME?
NINE DOLLARS INCLUDING  SHIPPING.
Stephen: LIVING ON NINE  DOLLARS A DAY.
CHEAPER THAN FAST FOOD.
Stephen: I CAN GET A LOT OF NUGGETS FOR THAT. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO GIVE UP  NUGGETS. BUT IT'S NOT VERY HEALTHY. IT'S STILL EXPENSIVE. NOT VERY BALANCED. THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN OF  ANIMAL PRODUCTS IS MASSIVE. JUST THE SHEER SCALE OF ANIMAL  PROTEIN.
Stephen: WHAT'S WRONG WITH  THAT? SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME OFF  MEAT. IS THAT WHAT THE POINT IS? IS THIS STEALTH-VEGANISM?
YOU CAUGHT ME THERE.
I DON'T WANT TO START WEARING THOSE SHOES THAT HAVE TOES IN THEM AND GET WHITE BOY DREADS. THAT'S THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO VEGAN USE A CRYSTAL ROCK AS A DEODORANT.
MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING CONCERNED  ABOUT ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. TEDDY ROOSEVELT SAID CONSERVATION  IS AS MUCH ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AS PROTECTION. TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW US TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON THE ENVIRONMENT
Stephen: TEDDY ROOSEVELT ALSO SAID I'M GOING TO GO KILL AND  EAT A MOOSE. MR. RHINEHART, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH.  ROB RHINEHART, THE PRODUCT IS SOYLENT. IT'S DELICIOUS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
