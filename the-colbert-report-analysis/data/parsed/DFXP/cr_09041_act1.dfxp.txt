[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, IS AMERICA
GUN CONTROL. IS AMERICA FINALLY READY. AIM FIRE! [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, AMERICA'S TROUBLING NEW  FOOD ADDICTION. AND MY GUEST NEAL SHUBIN IS A  PALEONTOLOGIST WHO FOUND A  MISSING LINK BETWEEN SEA AND LAND CREATURES. DU,-AQUAMAN. 2012 OF THE HOTTEST YEAR ON  RECORD. WE THINK. THE RECORD BURST INTO FLAMES. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT". ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN [  WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. PLEASE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I HAVE A GREAT  RESPONSIBILITY WITH THIS SHOW. I AM A NATIONAL TASTE-MAKER. WHEN I ENDORSE A PRODUCT ON MY  SHOW, IT TAKES OFF. YOU'RE WELCOME "THE CANDWICH." [ LAUGHTER ] SANDWICH IN THE CAN. IT'S THE FUTURE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I TRY TO NEVER USE THAT  POWER FOR EVIL OR FOR FREE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO TONIGHT I WANT TO TELL YOU  ABOUT AN EXCITING NEW REAL  ESTATE OPPORTUNITY. IT'S A WALLED AND ARMED  COMMUNITY OF  UP TO 7000  FAMILIES LIVING ON 3000 ACRES IN THE MOUNTAINS OF IDAHO CALLED  "THE CITADEL." [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE  ARMED COMMUNITY OF 1.5 MILLION  PEOPLE LIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF IDAHO, CALLED IDAHO. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, FOLKS, THE CITADEL OFFERS  EVERYTHING A PATRIOT COULD ASK  FOR, INCLUDING A FIREARMS FACTORY, [ LAUGHTER ] FIREARMS MUSEUM, [ LAUGHTER ] SHOOTING RANGES, EVEN A LIBRARY. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE AFTER A LONG DAY OF  BUILDING GUNS, ADMIRING GUNS,  AND SHOOTING GUNS, SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT TO KICK BACK AND READ  ABOUT GUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE, AT THE CITADEL YOU'LL BE  SAFE FROM THE FEDERAL THUGS AND  THE CO-OP BOARD. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO BOASTING  THAT IT HAS "NO LEADER," THE  CITADEL ALSO PROMISES, "THERE WILL BE NO HOMEOWNER'S  ASSOCIATION AND THERE WILL BE NO  RECYCLING POLICE." [ LAUGHTER ] SO GO AHEAD AND MIX YOUR GLASS,  PAPER AND PLASTIC. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU'RE FREE NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST FILL  OUT THE APPLICATION ON THE  CITADEL'S WEBSITE, WHICH ASKS YOUR STANDARD HOME BUYER  QUESTIONS LIKE:  "ARE YOU NOW, OR HAVE YOU EVER  BEEN A MEMBER OF, OR ASSOCIATED WITH ANY RACIST GROUP OR  SUBVERSIVE ASSOCIATION THAT  ESPOUSES THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF THESE UNITED STATES OR ANY  INDIVIDUAL STATE? IF SO, PLEASE ELABORATE." [ LAUGHTER ] YES! PLEASE ELABORATE! THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO HAVE  SOMEONE FULLY READ YOUR 700-PAGE  MANIFESTO ON HOW THE CIA IS COLLABORATING WITH FOREIGN  BANKERS TO RIG THE RESULTS ON  THE VOICE. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, WAKE UP. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN JUST SUBMIT YOUR $208  APPLICATION FEE, PAYABLE IN  GOLD AND OR SILVER. [ LAUGHTER ] AS THE FOUNDERS INTENDED. OR, AS THE FOUNDERS ALSO  INTENDED WITH PAYPAL. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, YOU MUST SOLEMNLY  PLEDGE TO UPHOLD THE CITADEL'S  13-POINT PATRIOT AGREEMENT WHICH INCLUDES PROVISIONS "THAT EVERY  ABLE-BODIED PATRIOT SHALL  MAINTAIN ONE AR-15, AT LEAST 5 MAGAZINES AND 1,000 ROUNDS OF  AMMUNITION..." AND "ANNUALLY  DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY WITH THE RIFLE BY HITTING A MAN-SIZED  STEEL TARGET AT 100 YARDS WITH  OPEN SIGHTS," AND "DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY WITH A HANDGUN BY  HITTING A MAN-SIZED STEEL TARGET  AT 25 YARDS WITH OPEN SIGHTS." [ LAUGHTER ] HITTING MAN-SIZED STEEL TARGETS  OF COURSE, THE ONLY WAY TO BE  PREPARED FOR INVASIONS BY TONY STARK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I'M  SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT MOVING  TO THE CITADEL BECAUSE MAKE NO MISTAKE-- THEY'RE COMING FOR OUR  GUNS. AND WE FREEDOM-LOVING GUN-LOVERS  ARE TOTALLY DEFENSELESS! OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW, THE GUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT NOW, GUN CONTROL TALK IS  SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE FOR REASONS  I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES MY POSITION. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AS A RESULT, OUR DEAR LEADER  OBAMA IS MORE DETERMINED THAN  EVER TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS IN THAT HE HAS NEVER TRIED TO  TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT LAST WEEK, HE APPOINTED  REICH MARSHAL BIDEN TO HEAD UP A  GUN SAFETY TASK FORCE THAT WILL CONVENE A "SERIES OF MEETINGS"  AND "OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS--"  "IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD CONSENT FOR ACTION."  MEETINGS? RECOMMENDATIONS? EFFORT? [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, THAT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE  TO JACKBOOTED POWERPOINT  PRESENTATIONS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THERE  ARE RATIONAL VOICES OUT THERE,  WHO HAVE A REASONED RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO WANT GUN REGULATION.
NOW GET A GUN AND GO AFTER  HER HIDE! WELL SAID. AND SAM'S NOT ALONE. STANDING WITH HIM IS NRA HEAD  WAYNE LAPIERRE, WHO IN THE WAKE  OF UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY, PUT FORTH A SIMPLE PLAN TO REASSURE  OUR TROUBLED NATION.
I CALL ON CONGRESS TODAY TO  ACT IMMEDIATELY TO APPROPRIATE  WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO HAVE PUT ARMED POLICE OFFICERS IN  EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL IN THIS  NATION.
Stephen: YES, JUST PUT ARMED  OFFICERS IN EVERY SCHOOL. THEY CAN WORK IT INTO THE PROM  THEME: ENCHANTMENT UNDER THE  SIEGE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FOLKS-- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PATRIOTS LIKE ARIZONA SHERIFF  JOE ARPAIO ARE ALREADY  IMPLEMENTING LAPIERRE'S VISION.
A CONTROVERSIAL ARIZONA  SHERIFF HAS A PLAN FOR STOPPING  GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS. HE WANTS AN ARMED POSSE OF  VOLUNTEERS TO STAND GUARD.
I HAVE DECIDED TO NOW SEND A  POSSE OUT, THE ARMED POSSE TO  THE SCHOOLS.
Stephen: THANK GOD. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE NOTHING REASSURES  PARENTS MORE THAN SURROUNDING  THEIR KIDS WITH THE KIND OF GUYS WITH A LOT OF WEAPONS AND  NOTHING TO DO ON WEEKDAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] THESE ARE THE KIND OF REASONABLE  SOLUTIONS WE NEED INSTEAD OF  BLAMING THE REAL VICTIMS:  GUNS. YOU SEE, FORMER NRA PRESIDENT  MARION HAMMER KNOWS THAT  OUTLAWING ASSAULT WEAPONS IS REALLY JUST ANOTHER FORM OF  DISCRIMINATION.
BANNING PEOPLE AND THINGS  BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY LOOK  WENT OUT A LONG TIME AGO, BUT HERE THEY ARE AGAIN. THE COLOR OF A GUN, THE WAY IT  LOOKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: SO SAD, BANNING  A GUN BASED ON IT'S COLOR. I'M SURE IF DR. KING WERE ALIVE,  HE'D BE STANDING WITH THE NRA  BECAUSE IT'S JUST A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT TO BE BLAMING GUNS  FOR GUN VIOLENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] ESPECIALLY WHEN THE NRA HAS  IDENTIFIED THE REAL CULPRITS.
VICIOUS, VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES,  BLOOD-SOAKED SLASHER FILMS,  OUR NATION'S REFUSAL TO CREATE AN ACTIVE NATIONAL DATABASE OF  THE MENTALLY ILL.
Stephen: CLEARLY, THE REASON  WE HAVE MORE GUN DEATHS THAN  ANYONE ELSE IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD ISN'T THE  GUNS. IT MUST BE THAT AMERICA IS THE  ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT  HAS VIDEO GAMES. WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT HAS  VIOLENT MOVIES AND WE'RE THE  ONLY COUNTRY WITH CRAZY PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY, BUT  CERTAINLY WE'VE GOT THE CRAZIEST  PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO  TAKE MY  WORD FOR IT.
IF IT'S CRAZY TO CALL FOR  PUTTING POLICE IN AND SECURING  OUR SCHOOL TO PROTECDT OUR CHILDREN, THEN CALL ME CRAZY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT  YOU, BUT I AGREE WITH WAYNE  LAPIERRE. YOU, SIR, ARE (bleep) IN THE  HEAD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
