Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW-- FOLKS, SOME HAVE SAID THAT THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE IS MUSIC. OTHERS SAY THAT IT'S LOVE. YET, I'VE ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE COMMUNICATING VIA SAXOPHONE DRY HUMPING. THE REAL UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH. IT'S A VERBAL SKELETON KEY YOU CAN USE TO TALK WITH ANYONE ON EARTH, EXCEPT YOUR DRY CLEANER. DONDE ESTA MY PANTS, ABILIO! SO IT'S NO WONDER THE WORLD IS DESPERATE TO LEARN ENGLISH, WHICH HAS OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE BRAZILIAN LANGUAGE TRAINING COMPANY C.N.A. TO EXPLOIT A DANGEROUS NEW SOURCE OF ENGLISH EXPERTISE.
WE CREATED A TOOL THAT CONNECTS OUR STUDENTS WITH STUDENTS IN THE U.S.A. LIVING IN RETIREMENT HOMES
HELLO? HELLO, HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YES, I CAN, CAN YOU HEAR ME.
I LIVE WITH MY OLD BROTHER HE HAS 23 YEARS.
DO YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF SAYING, "HE HAS 23 YEARS, "YOU COULD SAY, "HE IS 23 YEARS OLD."
Stephen:  NATION, THIS IS THE MOST TERRIFYING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. AND I HAVE 50 YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, THAT YOUNG BRAZILIANS ARE LEARNING ENGLISH FROM OUR SENIOR CITIZENS, IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL THEY HAVE FLUID DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SHERBET, EARLY BIRD SPECIALS. AND BRAZILIAN TEENS ARE TAKING MORE THAN JUST LANGUAGE FROM OUR ILLEGAL IMMI-GRAMPS.
THAT'S ME AND MY WIFE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
OH, YOU WERE GOOD LOOKING.
GOOD MORNING, DEAR JULIA. GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
IF YOU WERE HERE, I WOULD GIVE YOU A BIG HUG.
OH, YEAH, A HUG.
YOU ARE MY NEW GRANDDAUGHTER, AND I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
Stephen:  THEY'RE STEALING OUR LOVE! I LOVE YOU, TOO. NO! FIGHT IT! NATION, THESE CARING HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE AN ABOMINATION. IN AMERICA YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ELDERLY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO STORE YOUR FEELINGS UP ALL YEAR UNTIL CHRISTMAS WHEN YOU THERETO IT OUT WITH ONE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED, "THANK YOU FOR THE SWEATER." WORSE, THESE ANCHOR OLDIES ARE ARMING THE HISPANIC HORDES  WITH THE WISDOM OF THE GREATEST GENERATION WE CAN'T LET THESE KIDS LEARN THE SECRETS OF LIFE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO BEAT HITLER. THEN HOW WILL WE BEAT HITLER NEXT TIME? REMEMBER, THIS IS BRAZIL. HE MIGHT STILL LIVE THERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
