WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, BEFORE WE SAY GOOD  NIGHT, I WOULD LIKE TO WISH  A WARM WELCOME TO THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE COLBERT NATION,  LITTLE HARRISON ARTHUR  FISCHEL. SON OF MY STELLAR TALENT  COORDINATOR AMY SCHWARTZ  FISCHEL. IF I KNOW AMY AND I THINK I  DO, EVERYTHING WAS PERFECTLY  SET UP FOR HAR ISON'S  ARRIVAL. HE WAS GREETED WITH A CHEESE  PLATE, ROOM TEMPERATURE  SPARKLING WATER AND A  STANDARD ON-CAMERA WAIVER. SO BEST OF LUCK, AMY, AND  HOPEFULLY HARRISON WILL BE  LESS DEMANDING AND EASIER TO ACCOMMODATE THAN MORRISSEY  WAS. HE MAY NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO  PROMOTE YET BUT HE ALREADY  LOOKS LIKE A STAR. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBOD
