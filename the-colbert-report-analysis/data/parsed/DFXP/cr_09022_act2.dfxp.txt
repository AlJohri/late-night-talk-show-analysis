Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO FOLKS, I WANT TO TALK TO  YOU ABOUT A MATTER OF THE  HEART. NOT THE HIDEOUS ONE, I'M  SURE YOU CAN ALL HEAR  BEATING BENEATH THE  FLOORBOARDS OF MY STUD CROP. NO I HAVE LEARNED TO IGNORE  THAT. YOU HEAR ME YOU VULTURE EYED  MAN NOT REMORSE! NO, FOLKS, I'M TALKING ABOUT  A NEW STUDY THAT LOOKS AT  MALE-FEMALE FRIENDS OR  PLATONIC RELATIONSHIPS. NAME FOR THE GREEK  PHILOSOPHER PLATO BECAUSE  ARE YOU NEVER GOING TO GET  LAID TALKING ABOUT GREEK  PHILOSOPHY. NOW ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC  AMERICAN, RESEARCHERS FOUND  EVIDENCE THAT MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T BE JUST FRIENDS. CONFIRMING RESULTS FIRST  PUBLISHED DECADES AGO IN THE  NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF WHEN HARRY MET SALLIE. NOW THE SCIENTISTS  INTERVIEWED 88 PAIRS OF  PLATONIC FRIENDS AND  SEPARATELY ASKED THE MEN AND WOMEN IF THEY HAD ANY  ROMANTIC FEETING ITS. AND IT TURNS OUT MEN WERE  MUCH MORE ATTRACTED TO THEIR  FEMALE FRIENDS THEN VICEA  VERSA. THEY ALSO FOUND THAT MEN  WERE ALSO MORE ATTRACTED TO  FEMALE ACQUAINTANCE, FEMALE STRANGERS THEY SAW ON THE  STREET, PICTURES OF WOMEN ON  BILLBOARDS, SEARS CATALOGS AND PARTICULARLY PLUMP COUCH  CUSHONS. (APPLAUSE)  ITS SCOTCH GUARDED, IT'S  FINE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THERE IS EVEN-- AND  THERE IS EVEN MORE BAD NEWS  FOR THE GUYS. BECAUSE APPARENTLY MALES  ASSUME THAT ANY ROMANTIC  ATTRACTION THEY EXPERIENCE  WAS MUTUAL. AND WERE BLIND TO THE ACTUAL  LEVEL OF ROMANTIC INTEREST  FELT BY THEIR FEMALE  FRIENDS. WOMEN TOO WERE BLIND BECAUSE  FEMALES GENERALLY WERE NOT  ATTRACTED TO THEIR FEEL FRIENDS AND THEY ASSUMED  THIS LACK OF ATTRACTION WAS  MUTUAL. NOW FOLKS THIS NEWS HAS GOT  TO BE HARD TO TAKE FOR A LOT  OF MALE-FEMALE FRIENDS. PARTICULARLY THE FRIENDLY  FRIENDS OVER AT FOX AND  FRIENDS. BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR  THAT STEVE DUCEY AND THE  BROWN HAIRED GUY WHO IS NOT  STEVE DOOCY HAVE BEEN CRUSHING ON GRETCHEN FOR  YEARS. I MEAN WHY ELSE ARE THEY  ALWAYS JUST STARING DUMBLY  AND BABBLING. BUT GUISE, YOU HAVE GOT TO  FACE IT, GRETCHEN HAS NO  AFFECTION FOR YOU. OR FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,  ANYTHING ELSE. SO FOLKS, GIVEN THIS NEW  STUDY, I HAVE SOMETHING I  WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO THE  700,000 FEMALE VIEWERS OF MY  SHOW. LOOK, DON'T WORRY, THERE'S  NO RO PLAN PARTICULAR  INTEREST ON MY PART, OKAY. JUST LIKE YOU, APPARENTLY. WE'RE JUST FRIENDS. BEST FRIENDS. I JUST LOVE STAYING UP LATE  EVERY NIGHT WITH YOU, YOU  KNOW, TALKING ABOUT THINGS, YOU KNOW. LIKE FRIENDS DO RIGHT BEFORE  THEY GO TO BED. AND I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED  THAT AT ANY MOMENT BETWEEN  STOLEN GLANCES THIS COULD  TURN INTO SOMETHING VERY  REAL. VERY SPECIAL, SOMETHING  HONEST THAT WOULD CHANGE OUR  LIVES FOREVER. (LAUGHTER)  AND WHEN YOU AREN'T LOOKING  I DON'T STAIR AT THE NAME OF  YOUR NECK AND IMAGINE RUNNING MY FINGERS ACROSS IT. AND I DEFINITELY DON'T  IMAGINE YOU ARCHING YOUR  BACK AND WHISPERING MY NAME. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN WHERE DO YOU GET  THOSE IDEAS? YOU HAVE GOT A LIVELY  IMAGINATION 700,000 WOMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I'M SORRY, I JUST GOT  SOMETHING IN MY EYE. LET ME JUST GET IT OUT AND  AND-- EXTINGUISH IT FOREVER. THERE YOU GO. ANYWAY, MOVING ON. WHAT, DID YOU WANT TO SAY  SOMETHING ABOUT HOW YOU  FEEL? OH, OH, OH, YOU MET A GUY AT  WORK. THAT IS GREAT! I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. I MEAN YOU DESERVE A NICE  GUY. ANY GUY WOULD BE LUCKY TO BE  WITH YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
