Stephen: WELCOME, WELCOME, WELCOME ONE AND ALL! MY FRIENDS, MY TRUE FRIENDS.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! WELCOME TO THE REPORT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AFTER A GREETING LIKE THAT I JUST WANT TO BLOW YOUR BAGPIPE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE I TAKE A BACKSEAT TO NO ONE EXCEPT MY DRIVER PABLO. OKAY. HE'S A GUY, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE SEEN HOW WOMEN PARALLEL PARK, HUH-UH. BUT TODAY, FOLKS, I BELIEVE THAT WE AS A NATION CROSSED AN IMAGINARY LINE THAT IS SUDDENLY ALL TOO REAL. "THE COLBERT REPORT"'S SOMEONE ON MSNBC HAS MORE.
WE'RE WATCHING THE SENATE FLOOR WHERE THEY JUST PASSED THE EMPLOYMENT NONDISCRIMINATION ACT WHICH PROVIDES WORKPLACE PROTECTION FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT WORKPLACE COMMUNITY FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY. THEY WANT TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR AN EMPLOYER TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST  LESBIAN-- GAYS--  (LAUGHTER) BATMAN AND-- I KNOW THIS ONE, I KNOW ONE, TARTAR SAUCE, YES. WELL, THOSE INTO THE TARTAR SAUCE LIFESTYLE. NOW LUCKILY THIS ENDA BILL APPLIES ONLY TO COMPANIES WITH 15 OR MORE EMPLOYEES SO YOU'RE SAFE FOR NOW 14 BIGOTS MOVING AND STORAGE. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, IF YOU THINK, IF YOU ARE'S SAYING TO YOURSELF OH T WON'T AFFECT MY WORKPLACE, FOLKS YOU'RE DEAD WRONG. AS THE AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION WARNS, REST ROOMS AND LOCKER ROOMS COULD BECOME LANDMINES FOR DISPUTES AND DISTURBANCES. AN ANATOMICALLY MALE EMPLOYEE WHO CLAIMS A FEMALE GENDER IDENTITY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEMAND ACCESS TO THE WOMEN'S REST ROOM. NOW FOLKS IT'S ALREADY STARTED HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.x6 THIS IS TRUE, AN ALL GENDER REST ROOM SYMBOL. LOOK AT THIS YOU GOT A GUY, YOU GOT A GIRL, THE NEXT ONE OVER THERE IS ALREADY SPORTING A BONER AND--  (LAUGHTER) AND THE ONE ON THIS END IS IN SOME SORT OF CRAZY SEX SWING. NO WAY I COULD PEE IN THERE. I WOULD GET STAGE FRIGHT. NOW FOLKS IT IS A NIGHTMARE FOR EMPLOYERS. AS THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL COUNSELS, ENDA WOULD FORCE RELIGIOUS BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKPLACES SUCH AS CHRISTIAN BOOK STORES TO ACCEPT AS NORMAL TRANSVESTITE AND DRAG QUEENS. OH YEAH. IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT BETTE DID LETTER OVER HERE IS JUST DOING THOSE CAB A RECEIPT ACT UNTIL SHE LANDS HER DREAM ACT OF FIGURINES OF JESUS PLAYING BASEBALL. TODAY IT IS TRANSGENDER. TOMORROW THE GOVERNMENT WILL TELL ME I CAN'T FIRE A MERMAID. I'M SORRY, EXCUSE ME, A HERMAFROTROUT. NO MATTER WHAT IT COST KNEES MAKE HER CUBICLE WATERTIGHT. THAT IS WHY BEFORE ENDA TAKES EFFECT I'M GETTING RID OF EVERYONE ON MY STAFF WHO DOESN'T SHARE MY PERSONAL SEXUAL PREFERENCES. AND NOT JUST THE LGBHGTVLMNOP CROWD, OKAY. IF ARE YOU NOT A PREMIUM MEMBER OF TALL WOMEN CARRYING HEAVY THINGS.COM, WE DON'T NEED YOUR KIND AROUND HERE. NATION, YOU KNOW I LOVES ME THE SUPER BOWL. IT IS THE STANLEY CUP OF SPORTS PEOPLE ACTUALLY WATCH. BUT LATELY THERE HAS BEEN MUCH CONTROVERSY IN THE GREAT GAME OF FOOTBALL. FOR MORE THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. FOR MORE THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. NATION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NATION, I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF OUR CHILDHOOD WAS SPENT ON THE GRIDIRON BECAUSE I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION, SHOULD HAVE WORN A HELMET. AND MY FAVORITE NFL TEAM IS ALWAYS BEEN THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS. BUT MY TEAM IS FACING SOME UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS FROM THE PC POLICE.
WILL THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS BE FORCED TO CHANGE ITS NAME. AT A MEETING EARLIER THIS WEEK LEADERS THERE THE UNITED INDIAN NATION ASKED THE NFL TO SANCTION TEAM OWNER DANIEL SNYDER FOR CONTINUING TO USE WHAT THEY CALL A RACIAL SLUR.
FOR US, THE R WORD IS THE "N" WORD.
WRONG. IT'S IF THE R WORD WAS THE "N" WORD I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAY IT ON THE AIR, WATCH THIS, REDSKIN REDSKIN REDSKIN. SEE? (LAUGHTER) TOTALLY FINE. NOW LET ME TRY THAT WITH THE N WORD. N -- ♪ ♪  ♪ OKAY, SO SIGN HERE, AND SIGN HERE, THERE, I'M SORRY, APOLOGIZE, NO, I WROTE THE "N" WORD AGAIN, APOLOGIZE. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ANYWAY, REDSKINS TEAM OWNER DAN SNYDER HAS DEFENDED KEEPING THE NAME BY CITING A RECENT AP POLL THAT FOUND THAT 79% OF AMERICANS ARE IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THE NAME. 21% WANT THE REDSKINS TO CHANGE IT BUT I BET THOSE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CHANGE THE NAME OF POTATO SKINS FOR OFFENDING THE IRISH. BUT FOLKS, IN AN OPEN LETTER TO FANS SNYDER EXPLAINED I WAS BORN A FAN OF THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS. THAT TRADITION, THE SONG, THE CHEER, IT MATTERS SO MUCH TO ME AS A CHILD. IT ISN'T JUST WHERE WE CAME FROM, IT'S WHO WE ARE. YES, OUR PAST IS WHO WE ARE, WE REDSKIN FANS ARE PRONE TO THIS LAND SINCE 19-- 33. NOW STRANGERS THREATEN OUR SACRED GROUND WHERE WE FEAST ON THE FOOD OF OUR ANCESTORS, THE $14 HOT DOG. AND DON OUR CEREMONIAL DRESS, WIGS AND RUBBER PIG NOSES THAT SYMBOLIZE OUR PROUD TRADITION OF, I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHY WE DO THAT. BUT FOLKS, THIS TRADITION IS BEING ATTACKED AND IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING TURNING THIS BRAIN SCRAMBLING GAME UGLY.
THE MIAMI DOLPHINS HAVE INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED A PLAYER OVER ACCUSATIONS OF BULLYING. THE DOLPHINS ANNOUNCED THAT THE OFFENSIVE GUARD RICHIE INCOGNITO SUSPENSION SHORTLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT. JONATHAN MARTIN LEFT THE TEAM LAST WEEK AFTER AN INCIDENT IN THE LUNCHROOM WHERE TEAMMATE ITS REPORTEDLY GOT UP AND LEFT THE TABLE AS SOON AS HE SAT DOWN.
I BET THEY ALSO MADE FUN OF HIM FOR WEARING CLOTHES WITH DOLPHINS ON THEM. (LAUGHTER) SO I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THE REPORT'S DEEPEST SYMPATHYES TO THE VICTIM, RICHIE INCOGNITO. IF ONLY HE HAD A WAY TO HIDE HIS IDENTITY RIGHT NOW. I MEAN EVER SINCE THIS STORY BROKE, FOLKS, INCOG NILT OWE HAS BEEN PUSHED AROUND BY THE KINDNESS CABAL JUST BECAUSE HE LEFT MARTIN THIS VOICE-MAIL.
HEY, WAZUP YOU HALF N WORD PIECE OF BLANK. YOU BEEN TRAINING TEN WEEK, I'LL BLANK IN YOUR BLANK MOUTH. I'M GOING TO SLAP YOUR REAL MOTHER ACROSS THE FACE, BLANK YOU. YOU'RE STILL A ROOKIE. I'LL KILL YOU.
Stephen: PERSONALLY, I THINK IT'S NICE HE PICKED UP THE PHONE. (LAUGHTER) TOO MANY PEOPLE THESE DAYS JUST TEXT THEIR THREATS TO CRAP IN YOUR MOUTH. NOW FOLKS, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE PROTECTING RICHIE'S BLINDSIDE. HE'S ALSO GOT THE SUPPORT OF FOX NEWS ANALYST AND STAR OF THE PROBLEM CHILD MOVIE DR. CARL'S CARLSON, JIM?
LOOK,�i I'M IN TOTAL SYMPATHY WITH ANYBODY SNUBBED BY ANYBODY AND AGAINST HUMAN CRUELTY AND AGAINST BULLYING. BUT IT A LITTLE ODD THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE GAME IS TO GO OUT AND KILL PEOPLE BUT YOU GET IN TROUBLE FOR BEING RUDE TO SOMEONE AT LUNCH.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT, FOOTBALL IS ABOUT MURDERING PEOPLE. YOU GET SIX POINTS PER KILL PLUS AN EXTRA POINT IF THEY TAKE THEIR SEVERED HEAD THROUGH THE UPRIGHT. AND THERE IS ALSO SOME NONSENSE ABOUT CROSSING A LINE AND OF WHAT EVER DOWNS ARE BUT ONCE PEOPLE STOP DYING THAT'S WHEN I GO RECHEESE MY NACHOS. FOLKS, DR. CARLSON UNDERSTANDS THIS GETS TO A DEEPER PROBLEM IN OUR SOCIETY. AND BY THE WAY, LET'S BE HONEST, THIS BULLYING THING, IT IS A FAD, JUST LIKE SELF-ESTEEM, JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, LOW CASH DIETS OR WHATEVER T IS MASS HYSTERIA, WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT BULLYING.
Stephen: YEAH, BEING WORRIED ABOUT BULLYING IS JUST A FAD LIKE POODLE SKIRTS OR SEPARATE WATER FOUNTAINS, GET OVER IT. WHAT DOW REALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT T THIS ISN'T EVEN BULLYING, IT IS REALLY HAZING. MARTIN WAS A ROOKIE AND ROOKIES HAVE TO PAY THEIR DUES. THEN NEXT YEAR HE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF THREATENING TO CRAP IN SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH. IT'S ALL BEING A ROLE MODEL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
