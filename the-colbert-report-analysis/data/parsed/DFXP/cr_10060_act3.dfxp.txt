Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST, WHO BELIEVES THAT OBAMACARE IS WORKING. WOW. I HOPE HE'S GOT MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) PLEASE WELCOME PAUL KRUGMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. THIS IS ACTUALLY YOUR SIXTH TRIP TO THE SHOW.
INDEED, IT IS.
Stephen:  DID YOU BRING YOUR FREQUENT GUEST CARD?
I DID.
Stephen:  DO YOU HAVE THAT?
FREE LATTE?
Stephen: I'LL PUNCH THAT. THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen:  AND YOU GET A-- YOU GET A FREE SUB.
THERE WE GO!
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. NOW, PAUL, YOU KNOW WHY I HAVE YOU HERE TONIGHT.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  OKAY? BECAUSE I GET TO GLOAT OVER THE FACT THAT OBAMACARE IS A PROVEN JOB KILLER. THE C.B.O. CAME OUT WITH A REPORT THAT SAYS 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE FEWER WILL HAVE JOBS BY 2021 BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO AMERICA FOR HELPING TO PROMOTE THIS JOB KILLER.
THIS IS QUITE AN AMAZING PIECE OF-- I SEE A LOT OF MEDIA MALPRACTICE. A LOT OF THEM GOT IT WRONG. THE C.B.O. DID NOT SAY THAT.
Stephen:  YES, THEY DID? HAVE YOU READ THE REPORT?
YES.
Stephen:  I HAVE NOT. THAT WAY I GET TO CLAIM ANYTHING I WANT PAUL KRUGMAN.
WHAT THE C.B.O. SAID, WE KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE, ONCE THEY HAVE THE GUARANTEE OF HEALTH INSURANCE, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO ARE WORKING EXTRA HOURS, STAYING IN FULL-TIME JOBS, BECAUSE THEY NEED THE HEALTH INSURANCE. THERE'S PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, THERE'S OLDER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WHO ARE 63, AND NOT IN GOOD HEALTH BUT THEY'RE HANGING ON WITH THOSE FULL-TIME JOBS UNTIL THEY CAN GET MEDICARE. WITH THE LAW IN EFFECT, A FAIR NUMBER-- SOME PEOPLE-- WILL WORK SHORTER HOURS. SOME PEOPLE WILL RETIRE EARLIER. SO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS WILL BE REDUCED, VOLUNTARILY. PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO WORK LESS. NO JOBS LOST. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE CHOOSING TO WORK LESS. AND ACTUALLY THE C.B.O. SAYS IN BIG-- THEY SAY RIGHT THERE. THIS IS GOING TO BE VOLUNTARY CHOICE. PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO WORK LESS. THEY MADE THE MISTAKE OF SAYING THIS WILL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO MILLION FULL-TIME JOBS BEING REMOVED. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE NEXT DAY, THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.B.O. WENT ON TO SAY WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT JOB LOSSES. AND IN FACT, I AM-- THIS IS A GOOD THING.
Stephen:  HE HAD TO SAY THAT, HIS JOB WAS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  YOU THINK THE OBAMA PEOPLE DIDN'T GET TO HIM. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS YOU SAY IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL BE MORE MOBILE AND BE ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS AND NOT BE TIED DOWN TO HEALTH INSURANCE SO THEY CAN WORK LESS IF THEY WANT TO. THAT'S OBAMA'S VISION FOR AMERICA. EVERYBODY WORK LESS.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  HEY! PHONE IT IN! EVERYBODY GETS A SNOW DAY.   ( CHEERS ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S HOW ROME FELL.
WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR EVERYBODY BY TAXING MITT ROMNEY.
Stephen:  YOU WILL? HOW IS OBAMACARE NOT REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH, OKAY? WHY SHOULD MY HARD-EARNED MONEY GO PAY FOR SUZY SLUT'S CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS? I DON'T NEED THEM. BUT "SANDY SPREAD YOUR LEGS" WANTS HER CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS OR LUCY LUNG MACHINE. I'M HEALTHY OR I'M A YOUNG PERSON-- WHICH I AM-- WHY SHOULD I BE PAYING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S HEALTH CARE. THAT'S NOT THE WAY INSURANCE WORKS.
ACTUALLY INSURANCE DOES WORK THAT WAY.
Stephen:  NO IT DOESN'T, IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. IF YOU BUY FIRE INSURANCE, MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FIRES, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE FIRES ARE SUBSIDIZING PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD FIRES THAT YEAR.
Stephen:  I DON'T HAVE FIRE INSURANCE CAUSE I DON'T HAVE FIRES. IF MY HOUSE CATCHES ON FIRE I'LL GET INSURANCE. [LAUGHTER]
I THINK THE SLOGAN FOR OBAMACARE SHOULD BE, "STUFF HAPPENS AND IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU." BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS EVERY ONE OF US IS AT RISK OF BECOMING SICK, HAVING SOMETHING WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO INSURANCE TO PAY FOR IT. INSURANCE MARKETS DON'T WORK WELL. IF WE WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE AMERICANS HAVE A BASIC GUARANTEE THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED, THAT THEY CAN AFFORD IT WHEN THEY NEED IT, THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE OBAMACARE AND EVERY OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE, HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU NEED IT THAT YOU CAN AFFORD. THAT'S WHAT OBAMACARE GIVES YOU.
Stephen:  HEALTHCARE WHEN YOU NEED IT, THAT YOU CAN AFFORD, BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING MY MONEY. [LAUGHTER]
WE'RE POOLING.
Stephen:  THAT'S REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH. POOLING MONEY IS REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH. YOU'LL ADMIT IT. SAY IT. SAY IT. IT'S REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH.
ACTUALLY, I'M OKAY WITH A LITTLE --
Stephen:  YOU ALMOST SAID IT. YOU ALMOST GAVE AWAY THE WHOLE GAME. YOU ALMOST GAVE AWAY--
LIFE INSURANCE IS REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH FOR--
OK THERE IT IS. ISN'T ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HERE THAT, SO FAR, ONLY OLD PEOPLE ARE SIGNING UP FOR THIS, AND IT'S GOT TO BE YOUNG PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR IT?
ACTUALLY, WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IS YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SAYING. THEY'RE SAYING IT'S AN OLDER MIX OF PEOPLE, BUT IT'S WITHIN EXPECTATIONS. IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BETTER THAN THEY EXPECTED. YOU WANT TO KEEP READING THE FINE PRINT HERE.
NOT IF IT'S GOING TO MAKE ME LOSE THE ARGUMENT. [LAUGHTER]
THERE WE GO.
Stephen:  WHAT CAN OBAMA DO TO GET MORE YOUNG PEOPLE INTERESTED IN OBAMACARE OTHER THAN SENDING OUT TEEN ICON PAUL KRUGMAN TO TALK TO THEM? [LAUGHTER]
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING. THE PENALTY FOR NOT SIGNING UP IS NOT MUCH THIS YEAR. IT GETS BIGGER NEXT YEAR.
Stephen:  IT'S 90 BUCKS OR SOMETHING. YEAH IT GETS BIGGER OVER TIME, SO THERE'S THAT.
ALSO YOU'RE GOING TO START TO HEAR-- YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START TO HEAR FROM FRIENDS THAT, "MY GOD, I HAD THIS ACCIDENT, AND I ENDED UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM, AND THAT WOULD HAVE COST ME $20,000, BUT THANK GOD I HAVE INSURANCE."
Stephen:  AGAIN, REDISTRIBUTING MY WEALTH.
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF REDISTRIBUTING FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LUCKY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE UNLUCKY.
Stephen:  LUCKY! LUCKY? YOU THINK I DIDN'T EARN THIS JOB? I MEAN, I DID THE WORK OF BEING TOLLBOOTH OPERATOR ON THE JERSEY TURNPIKE AND HAVING JON STEWART DRIVE THROUGH ONE DAY AND SAY, "DO YOU WANT A TELEVISION SHOW?" I PUT THE WORK IN.
THERE WE GO.
Stephen:  PAUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. PAUL KRUGMAN, "NEW YORK TIMES." 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
