Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT  IS AN INTERNATIONALLY BEST SELLING AUTHOR WHOSE LATEST  NOVEL IS INFERNO. WHAT A COINCIDENCE, THAT'S  WHERE I PUT ALL MY BOOK. PLEASE WELCOME DAN BROWN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, MR. BROWN, NICE TO MEET  YOU. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE YOU  AND I WERE MOST INFLUENTIAL  PEOPLE AT TIME 100, YOU  KNOW. CONGRATS, YOU STILL  INFLUENTIAL?
DEEPLY.
Stephen: BECAUSE THE  ANGELS AND THE DEMONS AND  THE "DA VINCI CODE", 80 MILLION IN PRINT, RIGHT, THE  DA VINC AYE CODE.
CORRECT.
Stephen: YOU'RE LIKE THE  SECOND MOST POPULAR AUTHOR  NEXT TO GOD, I THINK. AND LIKE THE GUINNESS BOOK.
GOD HAD 2,000 YEARS TO  SELL BOOKS, THOUGH.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. AND YOU HAVE HAD A FEW YEARS  TO GO GUNNING FOR HIM.
NOT TRUE.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOUR NEW  BOOK IS CALLED INFERNO. ALL RIGHT. THIS ONE IS BASED ON DANTE'S  INFERNO.
THAT'S THE ONE.
Stephen: THAT'S THE ONE,  OKAY. I HAVE READ DANTE'S INFERNO. WILL I-- DO I KNOW THE END  OF THIS ONE? DOES IT END WITH LIKE SATAN  IN A GIANT FROZEN LAKE  CHEWING ON BROUGHT  UTT-- BROUGHTUS, CASSIUS AND-- .
YOU BRUNNED IT FOR  EVERYBODY. SSES SPOILER ALERT, CLIMB UP  THE LADDER AND GET TO PURG  TORE. SO ARE YOU GUNNING FOR MY  CHURCH IN THIS ONE TOO? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A THING  FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, MY  FRIEND.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
Stephen: IT IS TRUE. I READ YOUR BOOK AND  EVERYTHING IN YOUR BOOK IS  FACT.
THAT IS TRUE. AND YOU CAN SAYS CHURCH IS  THIS EVIL ORGANIZATION THAT  CRUSHES KNOWLEDGE.
THAT IS-- WHAT I SAY  ABOUT THE CHURCH IS THAT,  THE QUESTION I ASK IN THE "DA VINCI CODE" IS WHAT DOES  IT MEAN FOR CHRISTIANITY IF  CHRIST WERE NOT LITERALLY THE SON OF GOD.
Stephen: IT MEANS  EVERYTHING IS FALSE BECAUSE  THE CHURCH IS THE  RESURRECTION. THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE IS,  HE WASN'T A SPART DUDE THERE  IS A LOT OF THOSE. I'M SURE YOU ARE SMART. JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD, MY  FRIEND, END OF STORY OR  RATHER BEGINNING, CHECKMATE.
OKAY,.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: DID I JUST WRITE  A BOOK, I THINK I JUST WROTE  A DAN BROWN NOVEL.
WELL DONE.
Stephen: NO, I LOVE YOUR  BOOKS. I READ THEM ALL. EVEN LIKE DECEPTION POINT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND THE DIGITAL  FORTRESS, I READ THEM ALL  BECAUSE I LOVE THE RAGE THEY FILL ME WITH. (LAUGHTER)  WHY DO YOU-- WHY DOW PUT  EVERYTHING IN PUZZLE FORM? WHY IS EVERYTHING SUPPOSED  TO BE SOMETHING WE GOT TO  FIGURE OUT?
I LOVE PUZZLES. MY DAD IS A BIG CODE GUY. HE'S AN INTERNATIONALLY BEST  SELLING MATH TEXTBOOK  AUTHOR. I GREW UP WITH CODES AND  SYMBOLS IN THE HOUSE. WE HAD TREASURE HUNTS, ALL  KINDS OF CIPHERS AND I THINK  THEY ARE A LOT OF FUN.
Stephen: SO IT COMES TO  YOU NATURALLY.
YEAH, IT IS A BIT OF A  FIXATION.
Stephen: DOW LIKE  ANAGRAMS.
I DO.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU KNOW --
AM I GOING TO REGRET  SAYING I LIKE ANAGRAMS.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, DAN  BROWN, THE NAME DAN BROWN IS  AN ANAGRAM W ALL YOUR SUCCESS THE NAME DAN BROWN  IS A BRAND NOW. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I READ  YOUR BOOKS ON THE TOILET  WHILE I'M WORKING THE BRAN  DOWN.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I THINK I JUST  WROTE ANOTHER DAN BROWN  NOVEL.
WELL DONE.
Stephen: NOW WHY SUCH A  COMPLICATED POEM TO BASE  THIS BOOK ON?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAD  WRITTEN A LOT ABOUT THE FINE  ARTS. BUT I HAD NEVER WRITTEN  ABOUT THE LITERARY ARTS. SO ON SOME LEVEL DANTE  CALLED IT TO ME AS SOMETHING  FRESH. AND WHAT BETTER PIECE OF  LITERATURE THAN INFERNO TO  BASE A THRILLER ON. IT WAS A THRILLER OF ITS  DAY.
Stephen: NOW YOU ARE A  HERETIC, SO-- IN YOUR BOOK  ARE THE HER HE PARTICULARS TILL IN RED HOT IRON COFFINS  FOREVER?
THEY ARE, WHERE THEY  BELONG.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD. AND DID YOU WRITE THIS TO  FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH  WHERE YOU'LL BE WHEN YOU DIE?
NO, ACTUALLY. I WROTE THIS TO-- .
Stephen: I'M NOT LETTING  YOU OFF.
YOU'RE NOT, OKAY. I WROTE THIS WITH THE HOPE  THAT THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE  WHO LOVE THRILLER WAS COME TO IT, BE INSPIRED TO EITHER  DISCOVER OR REDISCOVER ONE  OF THE GREATEST WORKS OF LITERATURE EVER WRITTEN,  DANTES DIVINE COMEDY.
Stephen: I THOUGHT IT WAS  "DA VINCI CODE"-- I MEAN  IT'S GOOD, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I ENJOYED IT. BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE  ROBERT LANGDON AGAIN IN THIS  ONE.
YOU DO.
Stephen: TOM HANKS IS IN  THIS ONE.
HE IS.
Stephen: I'M DEFINITELY  GOING TO READ THIS BOOK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: NO, I DON'T  THINK I HAVE EVER SAID THAT  TO A GUEST BEFORE. BECAUSE I GENERALLY DON'T  READ ANY OF THE BOOKS THAT  THE GUESTS-- I'M NOT A BIG  READER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY WE  HAVE AUTHORS ON. WE SELL SO MANY BOOKS. BUT YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP  TO SELL A BOOK. YOU'RE DAN BROWN FOR CHRISTS  SAKE.
I APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP  I GET.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE  WELCOME. DAN BROWN, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DAN BROWN, THE  BOOK IS INFERNO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
