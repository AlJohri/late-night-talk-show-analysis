(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF BRAVO'S "WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE." TO MAKE HIM FEEL AT HOME, I'M ALREADY DRUNK. PLEASE WELCOME ANDY COHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, ANDY! GOOD TO SEE YOU! THANKS FOR COMING BACK! IT'S ALWAYS SO NICE TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW.
I APPRECIATE IT. ALWAYS NICE TO BE HERE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE THE GIGAWATT SMILE, A BREATH OF FRESH AIR, AND AN IMPRESSIVE AS HELL DUDE. YOU'RE AN  EMMY AWARD WINNING HOST OF, "WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE" ON  BRAVO, ALSO EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE  "REAL HOUSEWIVES" FRANCHISE
WHICH YOU LOVE
Stephen: I LOVE THE REAL HOUSEWIVES.  I GOTS TO HAVE MY NAYNAY (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND YOU'RE A BEST SELLING AUTHOR WITH A NEW BOOK, "THE ANDY COHEN DIARIES" -- A DEEP LOOK AT A SHALLOW YEAR.
YES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR EPIC SHALLOWNESS.
YES.
Stephen: IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT YOU COULDN'T GET YOUR ANKLES WET IN ANDY COHEN. YOU COULD NOT DROWN A FERRET IN HOW SHALLOW YOU ARE.
I THINK I WAS THE ONE WHO SAID HOW SHALLOW I AM. I MODELED THIS BOOK AFTER ANDY WARHOL'S DIARIES. OF COURSE, THE ARTIST WHO WENT OUT EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK, HE DROPPED A TON OF NAMES. I DROP A TON OF NAMES IN THE BOOK. HE WAS FASCINATED BY CELEBRITY, AS AM I. THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO SHARE MY DEEPLY SHALLOW BUT DEEP STORIES ABOUT A LIFE OUT RUNNING AROUND, HOSTING A LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW, RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE DEEP PART COMES TALKING ABOUT DATING AND I RESCUED THE DOG, AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE DOG. THAT'S WHERE IT GETS REALLY DEEP. THE DOG RESCUED ME!
Stephen: WOW! (LAUGHTER)
YES!
Stephen: THAT'S A TWIST YOU DON'T SEE COMING.
TOTAL, IT'S THREE-QUARTERS OF THE WAY THROUGH THE BOOK. YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.
Stephen: IT CAN BE DANGEROUS. IN REAL LIFE, IF YOU TRY TO TAKE A DEEP LOOK IN A SHALLOW POOL, YOU COULD BREAK YOUR NECK.
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SO IT'S IN THE FORM OF A DIARY, IT'S ONE YEAR YOU WROTE EVERYTHING YOU DID EVERY DAY  HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR YOU TO WRITE IT? (LAUGHTER)
LET ME THINK --
Stephen: DID YOU WRITE ALL THIS BY THE WAY? IT'S NOT GHOST WRITTEN?
100% ALL ME
Stephen: THE DOG DIDN'T WRITE ANY OF IT?
THE DOG DIDN'T WRITE ANY OF IT. THE DOG JUST WRITES HIS INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. IT TOOK ME EXACTLY A YEAR TO WRITE OF COURSE, AND THERE'S A LITTLE BRIDGET JONES DIARY THROWN IN THERE TOO, WHICH I KNOW YOU'LL ENJOY.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE A LOT OF WEIGHT AND WE WON'T RECOGNIZE YOU ANYMORE, WILL YOU?
NO. THOUGH I DID BECOME OBSESSED WITH MY WEIGHT AND LET  MY MOOD BE DICTATED BY WHATEVER THE SCALE WAS TELLING ME IN THE MORNING AT THE GYM.
Stephen: HOW YOU FEELING? I BROKE THE PATTERN. I BROKE THE HABIT.
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO TO DO THAT?
I JUST SAID, I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. I'M A FOOL. WHY AM I LETTING A VARIANCE OF 4 POUNDS DICTATE MY MOOD FOR THE DAY, TAKING IT OUT ON OTHERS?
Stephen: AND THEN WHAT DID THE PAXIL SAY? (LAUGHTER) THAT'S ONE OF THE SIGNS OF THE PAXIL, THIS MOVEMENT. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STARS YOU HAVE. YOU SAY IT'S A SHALLOW LIFE, BUT YOU DO MEET INCREDIBLE, CREATIVE ARTISTS. CHER, GOOD FRIEND ANDERSON COOPER, LADY GAGA.
YEAH.
Stephen: AT ONE POINT, YOU WERE HANGING OUT WITH LADY GAGA AND MALALA YOUSAFZAI.
YES
Stephen: AND LET'S SAY IT, IT'S A SAFE PLACE. MALALA'S  SUCH A STAR [BLEEP] AT THIS POINT, RIGHT?
YOU THINK THAT, TOO?
Stephen: TOTALLY
ME TOO!
Stephen: "I'LL COME, MAYBE -- WILL GAGA BE THERE?" WHAT WAS SHE LIKE? HOW DOES SHE FIT INTO YOUR WORLD BECAUSE SHE IS TRULY DEEP.
SHE IS TRULY DEEP
Stephen: ARE YOU HUMBLED BY SOMEONE LIKE THAT?
I AM ABSOLUTELY BUT I WAS ALSO QUITE AMUSED BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF BOTH OF THEM, BECAUSE THAT'S AN AWKWARD COMBO AND I LOVE AWKWARD DUOS AND THEY ARE ONE. AND I LOVE EAVESDROPPING ON THEIR CONVERSATION AND REPORTING ON IT
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT? GA-GA WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO HER ABOUT THE LITTLE MONSTERS AND HER FASHION, AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS TRANSLATING AND --
Stephen: WAS SHE TRYING TO INVITE MALALA TO BE A LITTLE MONSTER?
YES, I THINK SO.
Stephen: WHEREAS MALALA ACTUALLY LIVES IN A COUNTRY FULL OF ACTUAL MONSTERS.
TRUE.
Stephen: ONE THING I NOTICE IN HERE, I JUST OPENED A COUPLE OF PAGES AT RANDOM.
YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK, STEPHEN?
Stephen: I DID, BUT NOT IN THE CORRECT ORDER. I READ WORDS AT RANDOM. I THINK I GOT THE GIST
IT'S FUN THAT WAY.
Stephen: IT REALLY IS  YOU MAKE WHAT YOU DO EASY BUT I WAS JUST FLIPPING THROUGH THE  BOOK AND THERE ARE SO MANY CHALLENGES YOU FACE  IN THE BOOK
I DO.
Stephen: YOU FALL ASLEEP DURING YOUR MASSAGES. YOUR LOCAL DRY-CLEANER CHANGES MANAGEMENT WITHOUT WARNING. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO FIRE ISLAND BUT FOR SOME REASON WEST 12TH STREET IS CLOSED WHERE DO YOU FIND THE COURAGE THE GO ON, ANDY COHEN?
YOU KNOW WHAT? THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE STRUGGLE THAT IS ME. IF YOU'RE GETTING A MASSAGE AND YOU FALL ASLEEP
Stephen: DID YOU GET A MASSAGE?
DID HE DO YOUR LEGS? IF YOU WAKE UP AND SAY, DID YOU DO MY LEGS? BECAUSE THEY HURT. HE SAYS, YEAH I DID YOUR LEGS HOW DO YOU KNOW?
Stephen: NEXT TIME, PRETEND TO SLEEP AND TRY TO TRAP HIM.
YOU'RE RIGHT. THE BUTT OF EVERY JOKE IN THIS BOOK IS ME SO, YES, THOSE ARE SOME OF THE STRUGGLES I HAVE.
Stephen:  CAN I TELL YOU WHY I THINK YOU'RE AN ACTUAL CULTURAL ARBITER HERE? YOU'RE STILL THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE "REAL HOUSEWIVES" SERIES, RIGHT?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: HOW SMALL A TOWN CAN WE GO TO AND STILL HAVE REAL CRITICAL REALNESS OF HOUSE WIFERY? IS IT ATLANTA? CAN WE DO MEMPHIS? CAN WE DO FOND DU LAC OR DES PLAINES ILLINOIS? HOW BIG OF A TOWN-- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, WHAT CONSTITUTES REALNESS?
I THINK WE'RE GOOD RIGHT NOW BUT I YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING. I LIKE THE IDEA OF FIVE WOMEN IN MOM JEANS HOLDING CORN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW.
Stephen: I THINK THEY'RE JUST AS EQUALLY CAPABLE OF ALCOHOLISM AND RAGE.
100%!
Stephen: ANDY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THE "THE ANDY COHEN DIARIES" COMES OUT TOMORROW! GO GET IT! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
