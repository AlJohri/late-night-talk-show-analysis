Stephen: I CAN'T TELL. I DON'T SEE RACE. AFTER OBAMA WAS ELECTED. I COMPLETELY SHUT OFF MY RACIAL  SWITCH. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I  BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I LOVE  JAMES TAYLOR.

AS A BLACK FOLK. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR 30  MILLION OR 40 MILLION OR  WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS NOW.
Stephen: GOOD.
I THINK WE'RE PRETTY EXCITED.
Stephen: STILL?
YEAH, YEAH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN FACT, I WOULD GO SO FAR TO  SAY THAT THIS IS BIGGER THAN THE  LAST TIME.
Stephen: WHY?
WELL, BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND  OF -- NO ONE SAW IT COMING. CINDERELLA TALE WINNING THE  CHAMPIONSHIP AND THIS IS  DEFENDING THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND WE DEFENDED THE CHAMPION SHISM  BLACK FOLKS ARE EXCITED ABOUT  THAT.

Stephen: EXCUSE ME, IT IS  PAYBACK.
YOU --
Stephen: WHEN DO  REPARATIONS START? THASTLES A SOCIALIST POWER GRAB  IN THE SPEECH. HE IS TALKING ABOUT ENDING THE  PARTISAN DIVIDE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DOESN'T HE HAVE TO  TAKE SOME OF THE BLAME?
NO.
Stephen: WE HAD A CONGRESS  AND HE WAS THE VARIABLE. HE WAS THE X FACTOR, THE CHANGE. HE GOT IN THERE AND --
NO, NO.
Stephen: SUDDENLY WE'RE  MORE DIVIDE THAN EVER.
THE MID TERM ELECTION IN  2010, RIGHT.
Stephen: WE WERE ANGRY  RIGHT AWAY.
RIGHT.
Stephen: I GOT ANGRY  EXTREMELY ANGRY RIGHT AWAY. BECAUSE HE WON THOUGH. HE WON.
Stephen: YES.
RIGHT. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS BY  WINNING HE SHOULD HAVE UNITED  THE COUNTRY. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS BY HIM  LOSING.
Stephen: THAT WOULD HAVE  UNITED THE COUNTRY. HE PUT HIS OWN DESIRES ABOVE  WHAT IS BEST FOR THE NATION  AVERAGE LONG WITH THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM.
Stephen: ALONG WITH THE  PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM.
Stephen: WHAT?
ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE WHO  VOTED FOR HIM.
Stephen: THEY WOULDN'T HAVE  VOTED FOR HIM IF HE DIDN'T RUN  AGAIN. YOU ARE THE SON OF A MEMBER OF  BLACK PANTHERS.
FORMER MEMBER.
Stephen: THEY ARE NOT  AROUND ANYMORE?
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU NOT SEE  THEM KEEPING WHITE PEOPLE FROM  VOTE?
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
Stephen: YOU WERE THE GOOD  BLACK PANTHERS?
YES.
Stephen: WERE YOU RAL  CALLIZED AS A CHILD?
YEAH, I WOULD SAY SO. I WAS RADICALIZED.
Stephen: DID OBAMA FULFILL  YOUR RADICAL APRIL GENDA.
MY RADICALIZATION HELD THAT  THERE COULD NEVER BE A BLACK  PRESIDENT. IF ANYTHING OBAMA BROKE MY WORLD  VIEW ACTUALLY. THAT'S, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED  TO AMERICA IF ANYTHING IT MADE  ME LESS LESS RADICAL. I DID A FLIP-FLOP ON THAT. SAWED BACK AND FORTH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: AS SOMEONE WHO HAS  BEEN AN OBSERVER OF OBAMA'S  PRESIDENCY --
RIGHT.
Stephen: CAN WE TALK ABOUT  MICHELLE OBAMA'S BANGS FOR A  SECOND.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT COULD YOU THINK? A RARE MISSTEP?
AH --
Stephen: DON'T GET ME WRONG  SHE LOOKS UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL  IT'S A YOUTHFUL LOOK. IT'S LIKE SHE'S AUDITIONING TO  REPLACE ZEO --
THE FIRST RULE OF A BLACK  PRESIDENT IN AMERICA:  DON'T  TALK ABOUT A BLACK WOMAN'S HAIR. IF SHE THINKS IT'S GREAT. IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU IS SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. FROM THE "THE ATLANTIC."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
