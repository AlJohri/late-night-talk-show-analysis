[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THE "A" BLOCK", I TOLD YOU  HOW SOME STILL THINK BANKS ARE  EVIL--  JUST BECAUSE AFTER THEY PHOTOGRAPH KITTENS FOR YOUR  CHECKS, THEY BUNDLE THEM INTO  BURLAP DERIVITIVES AND INVEST THEM IN A RIVER. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL TONIGHT, THE BANK-BASHERS  CAN STAND DOWN. BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE PROMINENT  BANKER HAS FINALLY BEEN BROUGHT  TO JUSTICE. THIS IS NAILED 'EM. ♪ ♪  DHAWZ. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIVE YEARS AFTER THE GLOBAL  FINANCIAL CRISIS AMERICANS ARE  STILL ANGRY AT BIG BANKS.
NO WALL STREET EXECUTIVES  HAVE GONE TO JAIL.
NO ONE HAS BEEN HELD  ACCOUNTABLE.
NO CRIMINAL CHARGES, NO  INDIVIDUAL FINES WHICH WAS  INCREDIBLE.
BUT NOW ONE BANK WELLS FARGO  HAS FINALLY NAILED THE HIGHEST  LEVEL WHITE COLLAR MORTGAGE BANKER TO DATE.
MY NAME IS RICHARD ACHIEVES. I'M 68 YEARS OLD.
Stephen: THIS IS THE FACE  OF CORPORATE GREED.
WELLS FARGO MORTGAGE CENTER  IN WEST DES MOINES, IOWA.
Stephen: THE FINANCIAL  NERVE CENTER AT THE GREATER  DECEMBER MOINES METRO -- DES MOINES METRO PLEX THEY BROUGHT  THE HAMMER DOWN ON HIM.
THERE'S NO PLACE IN BANKING. BANKING IS ABOUT PUBLIC TRUST.
Stephen: THE FORMER HEAD OF  FDIC SHEILA BEAR SPOKE WITH US  FROM DEEP WITHIN THE BANK VAULT.
IF YOU DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL  YOU SHOULD SUFFER THE  CONSEQUENCES FOR IT.
Stephen: MAKE NO MISTAKE  HIS CRIMES GO WAY BACK.
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD IN 1963. ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING I WAS  SPENDING TIME WITH A HIGH SCHOOL  FRIEND AND TODAY TAKE HIS CLOTHES THROUGH THE LAUNDRO-MAT. I CUT OUT TWO DIME-SIZED PIECES  OF PAPER. I WOULD TRYING TO SEE IF THE  CARDBOARD DIME WOULD OPERATE THE  MACHINE.
Stephen: HE MADE A FAKE  DIME. THAT IS CALLED MONEY FRAUD. HE WAS ARRESTED FOR THIS MONEY  LAUNDERING. FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS HE RAN  FROM HIS PAST. [ LAUGHTER ] UNTIL WELLS FARGO CRACK TEAM OF  INVESTIGATORS UNCOVERED THE  TRUTH AND DID THE RIGHT THING. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS TAKEN TO A CONFERENCE  ROOM. THERE WERE TWO INDIVIDUALS FROM  HUMAN RESOURCES THERE PLUS MY  SUPERVISOR AND THEY SIMPLY LET ME KNOW THAT DUE TO THIS  CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN MY PAST I  WAS NO LONGER QUALIFIED TO WORK FOR WELLS FARGO.
Stephen: NAILED 'EM! WITH THIS ACTION WELLS FARGO IS  SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE TOLL  ALL CORPORATE CRIMINALS. SAY GOOD BYE TO YOUR LIMO, YOUR  PRIVATE JET, YOUR LUXURY YACHT  OR IN HIS CASE HIS SUBURBAN ESTATE AND DESIGNER SUSPENDERS. HARSH, YES BUT THAT'S THE PRICE  OF MALFEASANCE IN INTERNATIONAL  HIGH FINANCE.
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN HIGH  FINANCE. I WAS INVOLVED IN HANDLING  ROUTINE SMALL PROBLEMS THAT  CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE WITH THEIR  MORTGAGES.
Stephen: CLOSE ENOUGH. REACHED FOR COMMENT WELLS FARGO  TOOK A REFRESHING STAND FOR  INTEGRITY.
ONCE WE KNOW SOMEONE HAS A  CRIMINAL RECORD WE CAN NO LONGER  EMPLOY THEM.
Stephen: YES, BECAUSE  THOUGH CONFIDENCE CAN BE  RESTORED TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, A MORTGAGE CALL  CENTER EMPLOYEE FROM WEST DES  MOINES MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, RIGHT VAULT LADY.
I SAID A CRIME IS SAY CRIME  BUT THAT MAY BE JUST.
Stephen: WHAT?
THAT DOES SOUND A LIMB --  PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO --
Stephen: WHAT BE A  CRIMINAL?
>>O NO WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.
Stephen: WE DO. NAILED 'EM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
