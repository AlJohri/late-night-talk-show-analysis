Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, YOU KNOW, I WAS DRAWING ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER. HERE'S THE THING... [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] GOD, I LOVE YOU. NATION I LIKE AT, BUT I DON'T ALWAYS GET IT. I'VE STARED AT ANDREW WYETH'S "CHRISTINA'S WORLD" FOR HOURS, BUT MY EYES CAN NEVER UNFOCUS TO SEE THE T-REX AND THE VOLCANO, AND AS MUCH AS I ENJOY ART, SOMETIMES IT'S THE CRAZIEST [BLEEPED] THING I'VE EVER HEARD. FOLKS, IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, WHENEVER YOU SEE MASTERPIECES BY SOMEONE LIKE VINCENT VAN GOGH, WHETHER IT BE "STARRY NIGHT" OR "SUNFLOWERS," IT ALWAYS MAKES YOU ASK THE BIG QUESTIONS LIKE: WHAT WOULD HIS CHOPPED-OFF EAR LOOK LIKE? WELL, WONDER NO LONGER.
WOULD YOU PAY TO SEE A HUMAN EAR IN AN ART MUSEUM? THE EAR OF ARTIST VINCENT VAN GOGH IS ABOUT TO GO ON DISPLAY. IN 1888, THE DUTCH ARTIST HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAKDOWN AND INEXPLICABLY SEVERED HIS OWN EAR. NOW A GERMAN MUSEUM HAS A REPLICA OF THE EAR USING CELLS ACTUALLY GROWN FROM VAN GOGH'S GREAT, GREAT NEPHEW.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THAT EXCITING TIME IN EVERY CENTURY WHEN GERMAN MUSEUMS BEGIN DISPLAYING HUMAN BODY PARTS. FOLKS, AND THIS ONE REALLY DISGUSTS ME. THERE'S YOUR EUROPEAN STYLE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. VAN GOGH HAD TO WAIT 126 YEARS TO GET HIS EAR FIXED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW, ACCORDING TO THE "EARTIST," DIEMUT STREBE, THE STILL-ALIVE STILL LIFE WAS CREATED BY USING CELLS FROM LIEUWE VAN GOGH, THE GREAT, GREAT GRANDSON OF VINCENT'S BROTHER THEO TO GROW THE EAR AND A 3-D PRINTER  TO SHAPE IT. AND IF YOU THINK A PAPER JAM IS TOUGH, TRY  CLEARING OUT AN EAR JAM. NATION, THIS IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL USE OF BIOENGINEERING IN ART SINCE PABLO PICASSO CREATED THAT FIVE-BOOBED LADY SO HE COULD PAINT HER. IT COULD VERY WELL USHER IN A WHOLE NEW MOVEMENT. THINK ABOUT IT. USING THIS SAME TECHNOLOGY, WE MIGHT FINALLY BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THIS GUY'S FACE LOOKED LIKE BEFORE IT WAS MANGLED IN A HORRIBLE APPLE-PICKING ACCIDENT. OR EVEN BETTER, EVEN BETTER, WE CAN FINALLY GLIMPSE THE VENUS DE MILO AS SHE WAS MEANT TO BE. AND THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS EXHIBIT IS THAT VISITORS CAN TALK TO IT.
VISITORS TO A GERMAN MUSEUM ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR HOURS, LITERALLY TO ASK QUESTIONS THROUGH A MICROPHONE TO VINCENT VAN GOGH'S RE-GROWN EAR. THINK OF YOUR QUESTION FOR VAN GOGH'S EAR, PLEASE.
Stephen: I'VE GOT ONE: WHY, GOD, WHY? BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN EARS GROW ON CORN. I HAVE SEEN EARS GROWN ON MICE. BUT AN EAR GROWING IN A MUSEUM, THAT'S THE CRAZIEST [BLEEPED] THING I HAVE EVER HEARD.
