( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.ï¿½4@3 MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS AIB RAHAMZA BRUDER IN A NEW FILM ABOUT THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. THE INTERVIEW WILL BE SHAKY AND OUT OF FOCUS. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. I WANTED TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW FOR A LONG TIME.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M VERY EXCITED.
Stephen:  BESIDES YOU BEING A BIG STAR-- YOU LOVE PAUL GIAMATTI, RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  AND I'M KIND OF A BIG STAR, TOO.
VERY BIG.
Stephen:  WHEN I WALK AROUND PEOPLE DON'T APPROACH ME BECAUSE I AM-- I'M UNTOUCHABLE.
YES.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YES. .
Stephen:  BUT YOU SEEM JUST LIKE AN AVERAGE GUY.
I'M APPROACHABLE.
Stephen:  EXACTLY. EVEN IN YOUR MOST FAMOUS ROLES, YOU SEEM LIKE THE GUY-- HEY, I WOULD KNOW THAT GUY. THAT GUY MIGHT BE A FRIEND OF MINE.
THAT'S GOOD.
Stephen:  A COWORKER OF MINE. IS THAT A PROBLEM? THEN PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS GOING, "HEY, I THINK I KIND OF KNOW YOU."
YES, I GET TOUCHED A LOT BY PEOPLE. PEOPLE WANT TO TOUCH ME A LOT.
Stephen:  REALLY, WHY DO THEY WANT TO TOUCH YOU FIRST? ARE YOU LIKE A PREGNANT WOMAN, THEY TOUCH THE BELLY AND IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.
IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THAT. THAT'S NICE TO HEAR. I THINK MOST OF THE CHARACTERS I PLAY SEEM LIKE SOCIOPATHS.
Stephen:  THERE ARE A LOT OF SOCIOPATHS. I THINK WE ALL KNOW ONE.
AND THEY'RE VERY APPROACHABLE, TOO GLA.
Stephen:  RIGHT BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, THEIR HEART RATE NEVER GOES UP WHEN THEY KILL YOU.
Stephen:  THERE'S ANOTHER GREAT THING THAT MAKES YOU LIKE AN EVERY MAN IN THIS. YOU HAVE BURSTS OF ANGER.
SUPPRESSED RAGE.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE SUPROCESSED RAGE AT ALL TIMES AND AT ANY MOMENT IT COULD COME OUT IN A MOMENT OF REALLY DELICIOUS IRE. OKAY.
YES.
Stephen:  ANY CHANCE WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME OF THAT TONIGHT?
IT COULD HAPPEN. WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES. THAT COULD HAPPEN.
Stephen:  OKAY. YOU'RE IN THE NEW FILM "PARKLAND." >>IM.
Stephen:  THIS IS A-- THIS IS ABOUT THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION.
YES.
Stephen:  BUT IT'S NOT THE STORY OF REALLY JOHN KENNEDY AND JACKIE KENNEDY. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE AFFECTED THAT DAY, REALLY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES?
YES. INNOCENT BYSTANDERS WHO BECOME MAJOR PLAYERS IN IT IN A WAY.
Stephen:  YOU PLAY ABRAHAM ZAPRUDER. EXPLAIN TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ZAPRUDER WAS.
ZAPRUDER WAS A DALLAS SELF-MAD BUSINESSMAN. HE WAS A UKRAINIAN IMMIGRANT, AND WE.TO NEW YORK CITY, AND BUILT THUP BUSINESS EVENTUALLY, THIS DRESS MAKING BUSINESS. AND HE WAS A CAMERA ENTHUSIAST. THE CAMERA HE HAD WAS THE CUTTING EDGE SUPER 8 FILMAT THE TIME, AND HE WAS JUST-- YOU BE, THAT DAY HIS OFFICES WERE RIGHT ON DEALEY PLAZA, SO HE WAS VERY EXCITED. HE WAS VERY PATRIOTIC. HE WAS AN IMMIGRANT AND HE WAS VERY EXCITED TO GO OUT THERE AND HE FILMED IT, THE 28-SECOND FILM.
Stephen:  THIS 28 SECONDS WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY FOOTAGE WE HAVE OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE PRESIDENT?
YES, IT IS, I THINK SO, OF THE ACTUAL SHOOTING, YES.
Stephen:  DID HE MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS? BECAUSE THIS IS A CAPITALIST SOCIETY, AND HE WAS A BUSINESSMAN.
YEAH.
Stephen:  DID HE MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS?
HE DID. HE SOLD IT TO "LIFE" MAGAZINE AND IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL WHEN HE DID THIS.
Stephen:  EXPLAIN TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT A MAGAZINE IS.
IT'S SHINY AND IS MADE OUT OF PAPER AND HAS LOTS OF NICE PICTURES IN IT.
Stephen:  IT'S LIKE AN IPAD YOU CAN BURN. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WAS HE CONFLICTED ABOUT SELLING IT?
I THINK HE WAS, YES. I THINK HE FELT GUILTY ABOUT TAKING THE FILM AT ALL. HE FELT ASHAMED THAT HE'D DONE THIS. IT WAS ACCIDENTAL, HE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT, BUT I THINK HE FELT LIKE HE HAD DWOWMENTED SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE SO HE FELT GUILTY ABOUT IT?
Stephen:  WE HAVE A CLIP, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT IS-- WHEN HE'S HIT --
THE KILL SHOT?
YEAH. WE'LL PUBLISH THOSE FRAMES? BECAUSE I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE SOME THINGS THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED TO SEE.
IN THIS CASE, MISSING FRAMES COULD LEAD TO FALSE SPECULATIONS.
THAT IS NOT MY BUSINESS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MAN'S DIGNITY.
WE HAVE A RESPONSE--
HE WAS A DIGNIFIED MAN. IT WAS A VERY UNDIGNIFIED END FOR A VERY DIGNIFIED MAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID "LIFE" MAGAZINE END UP PRINTING--
NO THEY CUT THOSE FRAMES OUT.
Stephen:  HOW MANY FRAMES?
I'M NOT SURE. NOT MANY, BUT IT WAS THE ACTUAL SHOT THAT HIT HIM. s THAT WAS NOT IN "LIFE" MAGAZINE.
Stephen:  THOSE WERE LOST?
NO, I MEAN, NOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE CONSPIRACY THEORY.
Stephen:  I AM.
I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY IT WAS DOCTORED IN SOME WAY.
Stephen:  I WILL.
YES, I HAD A FEELING YOU WOULD.
Stephen:  YES, BECAUSE IT MAKES A BETTER STORY.
IT MAKES A MUCH BETTER STORY. CONSPIRACY THEORIES--
Stephen:  THE IDEA THAT ONE GUY SHOT THE PRESIDENT IS DINED'D KIND OF BOTHER AND SAD.
SAD, YES.
Stephen:  BUT IF THERE'S AN ENORMOUS CONSPIRACY OF PEOPLE BEHIND THE KEEPS OF OUR ADULT LIFE, THAT'S KIND OF EXCITING.
IT'S WEIRDLY COMFORTING, TOO, I THINK TO PEOPLE. I THINK IT'S HARD TORE UNDERSTAND ONE PERSON DOING SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T FATHOM OF PSYCHOLOGY OF ONE MAN SNAPPING LIKE THAT. I THINK IT'S COMFORTING TO THINK, WELL, THERE'S A WHOLE SYSTEM AT WORK.
Stephen:  ALSO THAT IT WOULD TAKE A WHOLE SYSTEM TO BRING DOWN THE PRESIDENT.
YES, EXACTLY.
Stephen:  ANY CHANCE ZAPRUDER WAS THE SHOOTER? I'M JUST SAYING HE WAS THERE.
I'M NOT SURE HE'D PLAY IT THAT WAY --
Stephen:  REALLY? YOU JUST GAVE AWAY THE ENDING OF THE FILM.
I'M SORRY.
Stephen:  PAUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
SUCH A PLEASURE.
Stephen:  PAUL GIAMATTI, THE MOVIE IS
