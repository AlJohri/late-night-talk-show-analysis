Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY JOURNALIST WHO IS CRITICAL OF THE C.I.A.'S OWN WARFARE. I AM HESITANT TO SIT NEXT TO HIM. PLEASE WELCOME MARK MAZZETTI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HEY, MARK, NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  AS I SAID YOU'RE A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING CORRESPONDENT FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES." YOUR BOOK IS CALLED "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE," NOW AVAILABLE IN PAPERBACK AND IT'S ABOUT THE C.I.A., IT BEING A SECRET ARMY, AND SOMETHING CALLED "THE WAR AT THE ENDS OF THE EARTH." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHERE IS THE END OF THE EARTH? ( LAUGHTER ).
A FEW PLACES, MANY PLACES.
Stephen:  OKAY.
THE IDEA I WANTED TO CAPTURE IN THE BOOK WAS THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME WHOLE HISTORY POST-9/11 THAT HASN'T BEEN IN IRAQ AND HASN'T BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN. THERE'S BEEN THIS WHOLE WHAT I CALL THE SHADOW WAR IN PLACES LIKE PAKISTAN, YEMEN, AND PARTS OF AFRICA WHERE WAR IS BEING WAGED OUTSIDE OF DECLARED WAR ZONES AND THIS IS AS MUCH A PART OF THE HISTORY OF 2001 ON THAN WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
Stephen:  DO YOU THINK THE C.I.A. IS DOING THE RIGHT THING THESE DAYS?
THEY'RE NOW REALLY MORE THAN EVER A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION.
Stephen:  DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?
I THINK THAT THEY'RE-- IT'S GOOD AND BAD.
Stephen:  COME ON, PICK A SIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) GROW A PAIR.
I THINK THERE'S PROBLEMS WHEN YOU HAVE WARS THAT ARE WAGED IN SECRET WITHOUT A LOT OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
Stephen:  OKAY, NOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE C.I.A. BECOMING THAT WAY? IS IT BUSH OR OBAMA? AND I'LL TELL YOU IF I AGREE WITH YOU.
IT'S ACTUALLY BOTH.
Stephen:  BOTH?
IT'S ACTUALLY BOTH.
Stephen:  THEN I CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND. I'M WITH YOU. IT'S GOOD AND BAD AS YOU SAID.
IT STARTED WITH BUSH, CERTAINLY SINCE AFTER 9/11, BUT IT'S EMBRACED BY OBAMA DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THERE'S A LOT OF CONTINUITY WITH THE COUNTER-TERRORISM PROGRAMS BETWEEN BUSH AND OBAMA.
Stephen:  PETRAEUS, IN ONE OF THOSE RECORDINGS THAT CAME OUT WHEN HE WAS FOUND OUT TO BE YOU KNOW HAVING A LITTLE SOMETHING-SOMETHING ON THE SIDE. IN ONE OF THE RECORDINGS HE SAID HE WANTED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE C.I.A. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION WAS GOING TO BE MILITARILY. IS THIS WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, THAT THE C.I.A. IS DOING A LOT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN THE WAR ON TERROR, THE ARMY IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO?
THEY'RE DOING PARAMILITARY OPERATIONS IN PLACES WHERE THE ARMY IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO.
Stephen:  ARE WE AT WAR WITH THOSE PLACES ONCE WE'RE BLOWING STUFF UP THERE?
WE'RE IN THOSE PLACES, SOMETIMES NOT AT WAR WITH THOSE PLACES. WE WERE AT WAR IN PAKISTAN BUT NOT NECESSARILY AT WAR WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN WE'RE IN WAR IN YEMEN --
Stephen:  THAT'S THREADING A VERY NARROW NEEDLE THERE. WE ARE BLOWING UP PEOPLE IN YOUR COUNTRY, BUT WE LIKE YOU. ( LAUGHTER ).
RIGHT.
Stephen:  OKAY, SO THEY'RE DOING THIS MOSTLY WITH DRONES, RIGHT?
A LOT OF DRONES. THERE HAS BEEN ESCALATION OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS MISSIONS AROUND THE GLOBE IN PARTS OF AFRICA. SO NOT JUST THE C.I.A. IT'S ALSO PARTS OF THE PENTAGON THAT HAVE SORT OF BLENDED TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS TO DO THESE KIND OF SECRET MISSION.
Stephen:  THE BLOWING STUFF UP WITH DRONES-- THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM AND OBAMA SAYS HE'S NOT DOING IT ANYMORE OF STRAPPING GUYS TO TABLES AND POURING WATER OVER THEIR FACE OR MAKING THEM STAND UP FOR 36 HOURS OR IN A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM FOR SEVEN DAYS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A BIG PUBLIC OUTCRY ABOUT BLOWING THEM UP REAL GOOD IN SOME PLACE SANDY AND ROCKY. WHY DO YOU THINK THE DIFFERENCE?
I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THAT. I THINK THAT SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN LESS HESITANT TO CRITICIZE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS. BUT THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENCES IN, YOU KNOW, WARFARE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN YOUR CUSTODY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TREAT THEM HUMANELY, VERSUS A BATTLEFIELD KILL. THIS IS THE ARGUMENT THAT'S MADE --
Stephen:  LET'S JUST NEVER HAVE THEM IN OUR CUSTODY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen:  WHAT DOES "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE" MEAN? IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME SHORT OF KUNG FU OR A NEW COOKING SHOW ON THE FOOD NETWORK WHERE THEY ASSASSINATE A RIB ROAST. WHAT IS "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE"?
IT CAME FROM A SPEECH JOHN BRENNAN GAVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO CONTRASTING THE BIG WARS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ CALLING IT THE HAMMER, SAYING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN THESE OTHER WARS USES A SCALPEL, AND A SCALPEL IS SORT OF A EUPHEMISM TO IMPLY SOMETHING IS WITHOUT COSTS OR CONSEQUENCES. SO I USED KNIFE BECAUSE KNIFE FIGHTS ARE FAR  BLOODIER.
Stephen:  DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY WAGING THESE MILITARY ACTIONS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS NOT A DECLARED WAR COULD EVER COME BACK TO BITE US IN THE ASS? AND IF SO, ISN'T THAT KIND OF A GOOD THING BECAUSE HAVE YOU SEEN AMERICA'S ASS? IT COULD USE A COUPLE OF BITES TAKEN OUT OF IT.
IT CERTAINLY HAS THAT POTENTIAL. SECRET OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THERE'S BLOW-BACK A LOT OF TIMES. THE SORT OF MORE YOU HAVE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OR EVEN INTERNAL GOVERNMENTAL OVERSIGHT, THE MORE CHANCE OF THINGS GOING WRONG. SO CERTAINLY ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS HOW MUCH OF THE-- OF THESE OPERATIONS RADICALIZE PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED TO THESE MILITANTS? AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO.
Stephen:  ARE THE THINGS IN THE BOOK TRULY REVELATIONS OR ARE YOU A C.I.A. OPERATIVE WORKING FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" TELLING US THINGS TO PUT US OFF THE SCENT OF THE REAL THINGS HAPPENING IN THE C.I.A.?
EVERYTHING THAT I-- IS IN THERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE TRUE, AND WHAT I'VE REPORTED. SOME REPORTED IN THE PAST THERE'S A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION IN THE BOOK. AND AS I SAID, IT'S AS MUCH OF A SORT OF HISTORY OF THIS PERIOD AS CAN BE TOLD WHEN THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT'S STILL CLASSIFIED.
Stephen:  LOUD AND CLEAR. MARK, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MARK MAZZETTI. THE BOOK IS "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
