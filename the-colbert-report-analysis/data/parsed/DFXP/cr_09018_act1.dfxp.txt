Stephen: TONIGHT NEW YORK  AFTER SANDY. WELCOME TO THE CITY THAT  NEVER SHOWERS. (LAUGHTER)  THEN MITT ROMNEY SCORES AN  UNLIKELY ENDORSEMENT, MITT  ROMNEY FROM TWO MONTHS AGO. AND MY GUEST DAVID BYRNE AND  ST. VINCENT HAVE A NEW ALBUM  CALLED LOVE THIS GIANT. IT'S A FAN LETTER TO CHRIS  CHRISTIE. A NEW REPORT SAYS THAT PAUL  RYAN LIKES TO SHOOT DEER  WITH HANDGUNS. AND WHEN HE FINDS OUT WHO  LEAKED THAT TO THE MEDIA  THAT DEER IS GOING TO GET  IT. THIS IS "THE COLBERT  REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: WELCOMED TO  REPORT, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN  SLARM STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I AM SO HAPPY YOU'RE ALL  HERE WITH ME IN THE WAKE OF  HURRICANE SANDY. COUNTEDLESS PEOPLE ARE STILL  STRUGGLING. AND BEFORE WE GO ON I WOULD  LIKE TO ADDRESS THE MILLIONS  IN THE TRISTATE AREA WITHOUT  POWER. AND I'M GOING TO TALK A  LITTLE LOUDER RIGHT NOW  BECAUSE I KNOW THEIR TVs  AREN'T WORKING. (LAUGHTER)  POWER CHALLENGED NATION,  PLEASE PUT DOWN THE PEANUT  BUTTER ARE YOU LICKING OUT  OF YOUR MOUSETRAP AND JUST LISTEN UP FOR A MINUTE. I WANT TO YOU HANG IN THERE. THE NATIONAL GUARD IS  ASSISTING THE JERSEY SHORE. GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE AND  PRESIDENT OBAMA HAVE BEEN  STRATEGIZING TOGETHER ON THE  CLEANUP. AND JOE BIDEN IS USING HIS  TEETH TO ILLUMINATE HOBOKEN. FOLKS--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LOVELY SET OF CHOPPERS. NOW FOLKS WE'VE ALL BEEN  AFFECTED BY THE STORM. EVEN ME. YES, I STILL HAVE POWER AT  BOTH MY OFFICE AND MY HOME  AND MY OTHER HOME. AND GAS AND HEAT AND PHONE  SERVICE AND MY T1 LINE IS  STILL LIGHTNING FAST. AND MY TOAST CERTIFICATE  STILL MAKING TOP-NOTCH  TOAST. BUT I DID HAVE TO TAKE IN MY  NEIGHBOR ALLEN AFTER HE LOST  POWER. I SET HIM UP ON A COT IN THE  GAR ACHBLINGT HE SHOULD FEEL  RIGHT AT HOME SURROUNDED BY  ALL OF HIS TOOLS I HAVE  BORROWED. (LAUGHTER)  I TOLD HIM--   (APPLAUSE)  I TOLD HIM IF HE GETS COLD  JUST START THE CAR. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FOLKS, THAT IS NOTHING  COMPARED TO THE ORDEAL I  WENT THROUGH THIS MORNING. YOU SEE, MAYOR BLOOMBERG'S  LETTING ONLY CARS WITH THREE  OR MORE PASSENGERS CROSS THE  BRIDGES AND TUNNELS INTO  MANHATTAN. AN OF COURSE NORMALLY IT'S  JUST ME AND MY DRIVER HECTOR. SO THIS MORNING I HAD TO-- I'M  SORRY, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY THIS IS HARD TO  GET OUT. THIS MORNING, INSTEAD OF  GOING IN HECTOR'S AUDI A 8 L  WITH THE HEATED LEATHER  SEATS I HAD TO-- TAKE THE  BUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES. A PUBLIC BUS. (LAUGHTER)  WITH THE PUBLIC IN IT. I COULDN'T FIND THE SEAT  WARMER SO I KEPT PULLING ON  THAT STRING TO CALL THE  STEWARD ES BUT NOBODY CAME. THEY NEVER EVEN BROUGHT OUT  THE DRIJ CAR. I FELT LIKE VIGGO MORTENSON  ON "THE ROAD"  COME ON BLOOMBERG I KNOW  THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME  STORM BUT IT'S BEEN TWO  DAYS. WHAT'S THE HOLDUP? HOW HARD IS IT TO DRAIN  SEAWATER FROM 20 MILES OF  SUBWAY TUNNELS? THROW A FEW SHAMWOW'S DOWN  THERE. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY! GOD, PLEASE. DON'T MAKE ME GO ON THAT BUS  WITH THOSE PEOPLE AGAIN. THEY WORE DENIM, EVERYWHERE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS, IF YOU WATCHED  THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I DON'T  LIKE TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. I MAKE CONCLUSIONS COME TO  ME. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG  OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, THERE IS NOTHING I  LOVE MORE THAN TAKING  PICTURES WITH MY iPHONE. IT IS SO CONVENIENT. WHEN I WAS A KID WE HAD TO  DUCT TAPE A POLAROID CAMERA  TO OUR ROTARY PHONE. BONUS T HELD 20 SONGS IF YOU  ALSO HOT GLUED A RECORD  PLAYER TO IT. AND THE BEST PART ABOUT THIS  LITTLE TECHNOLOGICAL MARVEL  IS THAT IT ALLOWS ME TO  DOCUMENT MY LIFE WREFER I GO FROM CONCERTS TO FAMILY  GATHERINGS, TO SPONTANEOUS  ERUPTIONS OF APPLAUSE FOR  FROM MY STUDIO AUDIENCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW LUCKY I HAVE THIS THING. SADLY, EVEN WITH MY iPHONE  THERE ARE STILL MEMORABLE  MOMENTS THAT I MISS. WELL, A SWEDISH COMPANY HAS  CREATED A NEW DEVICE THAT  WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.
SOMETIMES THE BEST  MOMENTS IN LIFE ARE THE  SIMPLE ONES SO WE STARTED  THINKING IF WE COULD BUILD A CAMERA SMALL ENOUGH TO NEVER  BE IN THE WAY AND SMART  ENOUGH TO CAPTURE LIFE AS WE  LIVE IT. THIS IS WHAT WE ENDED UP  WITH. THE MEMOTO LIFE LOG CAMERA. JUST CLIP IT ON AND IT  STARTS TAKING PICTURES AND  ALL THE PICTURES ARE SAFELY  STORED ON MEMOTO'S STORAGE  SURFACE.
Stephen: AT LAST. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY  TIMES I'VE BEEN BUYING  PRINTER TONER AT STAPLES OR  PAIRING MY SOCKS AND THOUGHT WHY AM I NOT CAPTURING THIS  ON FILM. MOMENTS GONE FOREVER. SO FOLKS, A TIP OF MY HAT TO  CONSTANT DOCUMENTATION. FINALLY SOMEONE HAS MADE A  WEARABLE CAMERA THAT  AUTOMATICALLY TAKES A  PICTURE EVERY 30 SECONDS. IF I HAD THIS A YEAR AGO I  COULD HAVE CAPTURED THE  BEGINNING AND END OF TIM  PAWLENTY'S CAMPAIGN IN TWO  PICTURES. (APPLAUSE)  FOLKS-- FOLKS, I LOVE THIS  LITTLE DEVICE. OR AT LEAST I WILL LOVE IT  WHEN I EVENTUALLY SEE  PICTURES OF MYSELF HAVING  LOVED IT. SO WHY LIMIT MYSELF TO JUST  MY LIFE. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING GET  MEMOTOS FOR ALL MY FRIENDS  AND MY FAMILY SO THEY CAN  CAPTURE THE REAL ACTION, ME. NOW THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I  DON'T THINK A-- THINK A  PICTURE EVERY 30 SECONDS IS  ENOUGH. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY  TO VISUALLY EXPERIENCE MY  LIFE IN REALTIME. GET ON IT, APPLE. WHERE'S MY II, I'VE BEEN  WAITING FOR FIVE YEARS. NEXT UP ON TIPS OF THE WIZ  EL, THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION  PUNDITS HAVE WONDERED  WHETHER MITT ROMNEY'S FAITH COULD HURT HIS CHANCES.
WE KNOW FROM EXTENSIVE  POLLING AS WELL AS AN  DECK-- ANECDOTALLY AND  CULTURALLY THAT EVANGELICAL DOES DO NOT FAVOR A MORMON  CANDIDATE.
FOR A LOT OF EVANGELICAL  CHRISTIANS, THEY DIDN'T  CONSIDER MORMONISM EVEN  CHRISTIANITY.
Stephen: OF COURSE, HOW  CAN IT BE CHRISTIANITY IF IT  IS NOT TELEVISED WITH AN 800  NUMBER. SO TO COUNTSER THIS PROBLEM,  ROMNEY HAS APPEALED TO THE  REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM, AN  EVANGELICAL TITAN AND RELIGIOUS ADVISOR TO 12  PRESIDENTS. ONE MORE AND HE GETS A FREE  FOOT LONG IN HEAVEN. BUT FOLKS THERE IS A CATCH. BILLY GRAHAM'S OWN WEB SITE  LISTS MORMONISM AS A CULT  ALONG WITH JEHOVAH WITNESS,  SCIENTOLOGIST AND  UNITARIANS. OH YES, THE DANG  JUST-- DANGEROUS CULT OF  UNITARIANISM, THEIR RULES  ARE SO LOOSE THAT THEIR TLE  SACRED FIXES ARE THE OLD TESTAMENT, THE NEW TESTAMENT  AND FREE TO BE YOU AND ME. (APPLAUSE)  SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A  MIRACLE HAS OCCURRED FOR  MITT. BECAUSE WITH GOD ALL THINGS  ARE DELETABLE.
A MEETING WITH MITT  ROMNEY SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED  EVANGELIST BILLY GRAHAM VIEW  OF MORMONS, HE REMOVED REFERENCES TO MORMONISM AS A  CULT AFTER MEETING WITH HIM.
ROMNEY TOOK SOME TIME IN  NORTH CAROLINA TO VISIT  BILLY GRAHAM. GRAHAM TOLD ROMNEY THAT WILL  DO, QUOTE, ALL I CAN TO HELP  ROMNEY WIN THE WHITE HOUSE.
THOUGH IN FAIRNESS THE  93-YEAR-OLD GRAHAM HAS SAID  THE SAME THING TO HIS  COATRACK. SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO THE  REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM FOR  DISENCULTFEWING MORE  MONDAYISM. FOLK, I AGREE, BILLY  GRAHAM'S WEB SITE DEFINITION  OF CULT SAYS THEY ARE THOSE  BELIEF SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT ADHERE SOLELY TO THE 66  BOOKS OF THE BIBLE AS THE  INSPIRED WORD OF GOD. AND ADD THEIR SPECIAL  REVELATIONS TO THE BIBLE. WELL, FOLK, THE BOOK OF  MORMON ISN'T A SPECIAL  REVELATION. IT IS JESUS FAN FICTION. RIGHT AFTER JESUS COMES TO  AMERICA TO PREACH TO THE  INDIANS, HE AND EDWARD  CULLEN BAPTIZE DUMBLEDORE. BUT GREAT, GRIPPING,  GRIPPING. BUT THE BIGGEST REASON  MORMONS ARE NO LONGER A CULT  IS THAT NOW A MORMON MIGHT  BEAT OBAMA. AND THAT IS GREAT NEWS FOR  OTHER CULTS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO TO BE  RECLASSIFIED AS A LEGIT  MASS-- LEGIT MAT RELIGION BY  BILLY GRAHAM IS BE A VIABLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. SORRY RON PAUL FANS, YOU'RE  STILL A CULT. (LAUGHTER)  BUT SCIENTOLOGISTS, YOU CAN  GET OFF THE LIST AS SOON AS  YOUR GALACTIC OVERLORD XENU  WINS THE IOWA STRAW POLL. AFTER ALL, CRAZIER THINGS  HAVE HAPPENED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
