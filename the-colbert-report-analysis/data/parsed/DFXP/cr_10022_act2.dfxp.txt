Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, AS A MEMBER OF THE UPPER MIDDLE STINKING RICH I SAY IN ONLY THE WORLD'S FINEST HOTELS. BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT LUXURY FAMILIARITY BREEDS RAREFIED CONTEMPT. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN ONE CIGAR HUMIDOR YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL. THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO MIX IT UP SOMETIMES AND GO GLAMOUR CAMPING. OR GLAMPING. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S NO BETTER TRY ENJOY THE GREAT OUTDOORS WITHOUT GIVING UP 600 THREAD COUNT SHEETS, GOURMET MEALS AND BUTLER SERVICE. AT THE FINEST ESTABLISHMENTS, EVEN THE WILDLIFE ARE TRAINED IN SHIATSU MASSAGE. ALTHOUGH I'M ALWAYS A LILT UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN IT'S A DUDE. BUT NOW I'VE DISCOVERED AN EVEN MORE EXOTIC HYBRID OF LUXURY AND ROUGHING IT. IT'S CALLED SHANTYTOWN, A LODGING OPTION AVAILABLE AT THE EMOYA HOTEL AND SPA IN BLOEMFONTEIN IN SOUTH AFRICA. IT'S MODELED ON THE HOVELS OF SOUTH AFRICA'S TOWNSHIPS. THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN STAY IN AN AUTHENTIC CORRUGATED TIN SHACK, EACH WITH ITS OWN BLACK SMOKE SPEWING FIRE, BEEF TALLOW CANDLE AND SQUATTER'S KITCHEN. LIKE A SANDALS RESORT IF SANDALS WERE MADE FOR AN OLD TIRE. IT'S GOT NOTHING ON GLAMOUR SLUMMING, OR GLUMMING. NOW YOU CAN EXPERIENCE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE TRAPPED IN A SHANTYTOWN, RESENDING RICH PEOPLE WHO DO THINGS LIKE STAY IN A PRETEND SHANTYTOWN. PLUS, IN ADDITION TO DESTITUTION INSPIRED AMENITIES LIKE OUTSIDE LONG DROP TOILETS AND SOMETHING CALLED A DONKEY GEYSER, THERE ARE ALSO MODERN COMFORTS LIKE UNDERFLOOR HEATING AND WIRELESS INTERNET ACCESS. I ASSUME REAL SHANTYTOWNS STILL USE DIALUP. AND SINCE THESE HOOVER VILLAS ACCOMMODATE UP TO 52 GUESTS, THE SHANTYTOWN IS IDEAL FOR TEAM BUILDING AND FANCY THEME PARTIES. OF COURSE THE THEME IS UP TO YOU. MAYBE A MASQUERADE BALL CALLED "EYES WIDE SHUT TO OTHER PEOPLE'S SUFFERING." (LAUGHTER) THE ONLY PROBLEM, IS SOUTH AFRICA IS REALLY FAR AWAY, FOLKS. I MEAN IT'S SOUTH OF AFRICA. THAT'S WHY I'M BRINGING THE GLUMMING EXPERIENCE HOME TO THE STATES WITH MY NEW RESORT "FRIGIDAIRE LODGE AT OVERPASS MEADOWS." (LAUGHTER) JUST MINUTES FROM THE SUMPTUOUS DECAY OF DOWNTOWN (IN A FRENCH ACCENT) DETROIT. YOU'LL SAY IN A CARDBOARD REFRIGERATOR BOX FITTED OUT WITH JAPANESE SATIN MOVING BLANKETS AND MOST OF A PAIR OF SLIPPERS. ENJOY AN EVENING STROLL OF OUR ABANDONED LOT, LOVINGLY LANDSCAPED WITH VINTAGE TRUCKER BOMBS. JUST DON'T FORGET TO BE BACK IN TIME FOR THE NIGHTLY WINE AND CHEESE STABBING. ONE LOOK AND YOU'LL KNOW WHY TRIP ADVISOR SAID "AAHH! RACCOONS!" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
