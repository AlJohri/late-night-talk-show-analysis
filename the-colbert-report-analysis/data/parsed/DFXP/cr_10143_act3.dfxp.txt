Stephen: MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE HERE TO DISCUSS "THE GIVER," THEIR NEW FILM ABOUT A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE IS FORCED TO CONFORM. SO, HIGH SCHOOL? PLEASE WELCOME JEFF BRIDGES AND LOIS LOWRY! (Cheers and applause) JEFF, MS. LOWRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! JEFF BRIDGES, YOU ARE AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNING ACTOR, PRODUCER, MUSICIAN. LOIS LOWRY, YOU ARE THE NEWBERRY AWARD WINNING AUTHOR OF OVER 30 BOOKS -- (APPLAUSE) -- ONE OF WHICH IS "THE GIVER" AND NOW THE TWO OF YOU HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER TO MAKE A NEW MOVIE IN WHICH YOU STAR AS "THE GIVER" AND IT OPENS IN THEATERS AUGUST 15. WHY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS MOVIE, MAN?
WELL, IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPH ON THE COVER THAT LOIS TOOK.
STEPHEN: IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU.
WELL, YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE MY FATHER, LLOYD BRIDGES --
THIS WAS MANY YEARS AGO. -- THIS WAS 18 YEARS AGO. AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE THAT MY KIDS CAN WATCH. THIS LOOKS LIKE IT HAS THE NEWBERRY STAMP AWARD ON THERE. MY DAD'S UP FOR IT AND, YOU KNOW --
STEPHEN: DID YOU MAKE IT? WELL --
STEPHEN: YOUR DAD PASSED AWAY MANY YEARS AGO.
WE MADE THE VIDEO VERSION OF IT.
STEPHEN: OKAY. AND YOU MAY SEE IT AT SOME POINT IN TIME. WE DO THIS PAST-FUTURE THING. YOU NEVER KNOW HOW IT MIGHT WORK OUT.
HE'S TRYING TO FIND IT, IT'S IN HIS GARAGE SOMEPLACE.
STEPHEN: ARE THERE A LOT OF OLD FILMS OF YOURS YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? (LAUGHTER) LOIS, MY KIDS LOVE THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK HAS BEEN READ MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF TIMES. IT'S ASSIGNED IN SCHOOLS. IS THAT A BADGE OF HONOR THAT IT'S ASSIGNED IN SCHOOLS OR, WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, YOU GO, OH, MY GOD! DON'T MAKE THEM READ IT!
WHEN I HEAR FROM KIDS BY EMAIL WHO SAY, TELL ME ALL THE SIMILES AND METAPHORS IN THE BOOK, I NEED THIS INFORMATION BY THURSDAY. THEN I HATE IT. ARE THERE A LOT OF SIMILES AND METAPHORS IN THIS BOOK? WHAT I'M ASKING IS, WILL THIS INTERVIEW BE ON THE TEST?
Stephen: IS IT A METAPHOR FOR SOMETHING? FOR THE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY OF  THE GIVER -- OBVIOUSLY, I DO -- (LAUGHTER) -- TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT AN OLD GUY PLAYED BY JEFF BRIDGES WHO HAS AN ENORMOUS JOB TRANSMITTING TO A YOUNG BOY PLAYED BY BRENTON THWAITES -- WHO'S NOT HERE, TOO BAD HE'S VERY SWEET AND CUTE, TRANSMITTING TO HIM ALL THE MEMORIES OF THE CULTURE FOR THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
Stephen: AND THE REASON HE HAS TO DO IT IS, IN THE FUTURE, THERE IS THIS PLACE CALLED "THE COMMUNITY" AND IN IT THEY DON'T HAVE MEMORY.
THEY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO MANIPULATE HUMAN MEMORY FOR THEIR PURPOSES.
Stephen: IS THAT A GOOD OR BAD THING NOT TO HAVE MEMORY? BECAUSE THERE IS STUFF I WOULD LIKE TO FORGET.
WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO FORGET SOME THINGS.
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD. THIS GUY FORGOT WHERE HIS FILM WAS JOHN KLEIN WROTE, TODAY I WALK DOWN THE STREET I USED TO WANDER, SCRATCHED MY HEAD AND MADE MYSELF A BET, THERE ARE ALL THESE THINGS I DON'T THINK I REMEMBER, HOW LUCKY CAN ONE MAN GET. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT HURT US?
YOU REMEMBERED FOUR LINES OF POETRY. I CAN'T DO THAT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT'S THE VALUE? WHY DOES THIS SOCIETY, THIS COMMUNITY, WHY DO THEY PURPOSEFULLY INJECT PEOPLE WITH SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM FORGET?
THEY'RE GOING FOR PERFECTION.
Stephen: IS THAT BAD? YEAH. IT DOESN'T WORK. WE'RE PERFECTLY IMPERFECT, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY. WHAT DO THEY ACHIEVE? LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DOWN SIDES. WHAT DOES A SOCIETY ACHIEVE? WHAT ARE THE PROS?
THEY ARE COMFORTABLE, SAFE, THEY'RE HAPPY.
Stephen: ALL OF THAT SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD, I'VE GOT TO SAY. I WOULDN'T MIND BEING COMFORTABLE AND SAFE AND HAPPY.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO NOT LOVE? BECAUSE, AS THE SONG GOES, LOVE HURTS. ♪ LOVE HURTS...♪
Stephen: LOVE IS A  BATTLEFIELD.
OH!
Stephen: OKAY. SO YOU HAVE TO SUFFER TO LOVE?
SUFFERING IS A PART OF THE WHOLE DEAL, MAN. IT'S HUMAN. WHEN YOU TRY TO GET RID OF THAT, IT CAUSES A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS KIND OF BEAR WITNESS TO OUR SUFFERING AND TRY TO GET SOME EMPATHY FOR EACH OTHER.
AND ALONG WITH THE THINGS THEY GAINED, THE COMFORT AND HAPPINESS, THEY HAVE LOST SOMETHING OF THEIR HUMANITY BUT ALSO THEY LOST ART, MUSIC, LITERATURE. THERE'S NO BOOKS EXCEPT IN THE PLACE WHERE HE LIVES. HE LIVES IN A PLACE WITH 22,000 BOOKS ON THE SHELVES AND WALLS.
I HAVE ONE BEEF WITH THE BOOK AND I'M SURE THE MOVIE, TOO, IS IT'S A LITTLE ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN, OKAY? IT'S GOT A PROBLEM WITH AUTHORITY, AND I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT, TOO, BECAUSE SINCE THIS BOOK IS ASSIGNED, SHOULDN'T KIDS REBEL AGAINST AUTHORITY AND REFUSE TO READ IT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS TOLD THEM TO?
THERE IS THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: "THE GIVER" IN THEATERS AUGUST 15th. LOIS LOWRY, JEFF BRIDGES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
