Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ONIGHT, TROUBLING  NEWS FROM THE ARCTIC. THAT ICEBERG THAT SUNK THE  TITANIC HAS NEVER BEEN BROUGHT  TO JUSTICE. THEN HOW MUCH SHOULD VOTERS KNOW  ABOUT THE CANDIDATES? I'D SAY MORE THAN MITT ROMNEY,  LESS THAN ANTHONY WEINER. AND MY GUEST, DR. ATUL GAWANDE  HAS WRITTEN ABOUT HOW IDEAS  CATCH ON. I ALWAYS HEARD YOU GOT THEM FROM  A TOILET SEAT. CNN IS OFFERING DO'S AND DON'T'S  FOR SUMMERTIME SEX. FIRST DON'T: WATCH CNN. STHIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: YOU KNOW, FOLKS, YOU  KNOW, FOLKS, WHAT YOU JUST DID  THERE... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE, FOLKS. I'VE GOT TELL YOU, WELCOME TO  THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THAT CHANTING OF MY NAME YOU  JUST DID, I DON'T CARE WHAT  ANYBODY SAYS, THAT'S THE SONG OF THE SUMMER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NATION, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS  SHOW YOU KNOW I ALWAYS BRING YOU  THE HOTTEST DEVELOPMENTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. AND THANKS TO GLOBAL WARMING, IT  DON'T GET NO HOTTER THAN THE  ARCTIC BECAUSE THE NORTH POLE, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE TOP OF  OUR PLANET'S ICE-TOUPEE, IS NOW  A LAKE. WHICH MEANS THE ACTUAL POLE  ITSELF HAS GONE FROM "CHARMING  LANDMARK" TO "THING TO CLIMB FOR SURVIVAL."  WHICH OF COURSE BRINGS US TO  TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT OF SMOKIN'  POLE: THE QUEST FOR ARCTIC  RICHES. FOLKS, AFTER A MONTH OF  TEMPERATURES TWO TO FIVE DEGREES  HIGHER THAN AVERAGE, THE NORTH POLE HAS GONE FROM THIS TO THIS. NOW, NO SURPRISE THE ICE MELTED. THE NORTH POLE IS AT THE TOP OF  THE EARTH SO IT'S CLOSER TO THE  SUN. THAT'S JUST SCIENCE. THIS, OF COURSE, IS BAD NEWS FOR  SUPERMAN WHO IS FINALLY OUT OF  EXCUSES FOR WHY HE'S NEVER HAD AQUAMAN OVER. "YOU WOULD HATE IT. IT'S FROZEN."  BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, NOW WE  KNOW WHY SANTA'S BEEN GIVING US  ALL THAT COAL IN OUR STOCKINGS. HE WANTED BEACH-FRONT PROPERTY. AND ANYONE WHO IS IS ALARMED BY  THIS NEW ARCTIC LAKE, YOU SHOULD  JUST RELAX. IT'S JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT  THAT HAS OCCURREDDED EVERY  SUMMER SINCE 2003. NO REASON TO PANIC. THE TIME FOR PANICKING WAS 2003. WAY TOO LATE NOW. BESIDES, THIS IS NOTHING NEW IN  EARTH'S HISTORY BECAUSE WARM  CLIMATES EXTENDED INTO THE ARCTIC AS RECENTLY AS THE EOCENE  EPOCH, 56 TO 4 MILLION YEARS  AGO. AND PEOPLE GOT ALONG FINE BACK  THEN. TECHNICALLY THERE WERE NO PEOPLE  BUT EVERYTHING WAS PEACHY KEEN  FOR PALEOCHIROPTERYX, THE FIRST RECOGNIZABLE BAT. SO AS OUR CLIMATE SHIFTS BACK  INTO THAT OF THE EOCENE AND ALL  THOSE EXTINCT ANIMALS RETURN TO THE ARCTIC, WE HUMANS WILL JUST  HAVE TO HAVE ADAPT. LET'S SING IT FOR SANTA, KIDS. RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED RED HORPED  BRONTOTHERIUM HAD A PROM NET  NASAL RIDGE AND IF YOU EVER SAW IT, YOU WOULD SAY, DEARED GOD,  I'M BEING CHASED BY THE  BRONTOTHERIUM NATURAL PREDATOR ANDREW-SARCUS, A 13-FOOT  CARNIVOROUS DOG. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, FOLKS, I SAY LET'S ENJOY  THIS MELTING ICE CAP AND MAYBE  TURN A BUCK ON IT. AFTER ALL, THAT MELTED NORTH  POLE LAKE SURE LOOKS REFRESHING. LET'S SEND SOME TANKER TRUCKS UP  THERE, SUCK IT UP AND BOTTLE IT. WE CAN CALL IT "POLE AND SPRINGS  ."  AND THANKS TO ALL THAT TRUCK  EXHAUST, WE'LL NEVER RUN OUT. FOLKS, OUR LAWMAKERS' POPULARITY  KEEPS SINKING FASTER THAN A  RESEARCH FACILITY AT THE NORTH  POLE. IN THE LATEST PHONE SURVEY ABOUT  CONGRESS, IT RANKED BELOW HAVING  YOUR DINNER INTERRUPTED BY A PHONE SURVEY ABOUT CONGRESS. BUT THESE NUMBERS HAVE NOTHING  TO DO WITH THE JOB THAT THE  LAWMAKERS ARE DOING BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT DOING IT. HALFWAY THROUGH 2013 JUST 15  BILLS PASSED BY CONGRESS HAD  BECOME LAW. THEY ALMOST PASSEDDED A 16th  BILL BUT OBAMA REFUSED TO SIGN  HR-2904, THE "THIS IS NOT ANOTHER REPEAL OF OBAMA CARE, WE  SWEAR BUT DON'T LOOK INSIDE IT,  JUST SIGN IT" ACT. BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME CONGRESS FOR  HOW LITTLE THEY GET DONE. TAKING A POSITION ON ANYTHING IS  POLITICAL SUICIDE. JUST LOOK AT SENATE MINORITY  LEADER MITCH McCONNELL. HE'S THE MOST OBSTRUCTIONIST,  BILL-BLOCKIN'EST HUMAN LAW-CORK  EVER TO JAM UP THE HAULS OF CONGRESS USING THE FILIBUSTER  413 TIMES SINCE 2007, TWICE AS  MUCH AS THE LAST DEMOCRATIC MINORITY WHICH EARNED HIM THE  NICKNAME "SENATOR GRIDLOCK."  YEAH, GOOD OLSEN TORE GRIDLOCK, THE KENTUCKY CONSTIPATOR, THE  LOUISVILLE PLUGGER. BUT EVEN THE LEADER OF THE  DO-NOTHING CONGRESS IS IS NOW  BEING PUNISHED FOR THE HANDFUL OF TIMES HE DONE DID SOMETHING.
MITCH McCONNELL IS GETTING  PRIMARIED HARD. AN OPEN LETTER, THIS IS  INCREDIBLE TO ME, FROM 15  KENTUCKY TEA PARTY GROUPS SAID SENATOR McCONNELL'S  PROGRESSIVE, LIBERAL VOTING  RECORD AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO  ROLL OVER AND CEDE POWER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE LIBERALS  IN WASHINGTON PROVE HE IS NO  FRIEND TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR THE CITIZENS OF THE COMMONWEALTH  OF KENTUCKY
Stephen: I KNEW THIS GUY WAS  A LEFT WING PROGRESSIVE LOON IN  2010 WHEN HE SAID THIS.
OUR TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY  OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SHOULD  BE TO DENY PRESIDENT OBAMA A SECOND TERM. DISBELIEF SO BACK TO THE LESBIAN  FOOD CO-OP, RAINBOW WARRIOR. NOW FORTUNATELY THERE'S A WAY  FOR LAWMAKERS TO DO THEIR JOBS  WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES, AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SECRETS AND LAWS. NATION, LIKE ALL AMERICANS, I AM  CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE SENATE  FINANCE COMMITTEE'S EFFORT TO DRAFT A NEW COMPREHENSIVE TAX  REFORM BILL. NOW, FOLKS, THE COMMITTEE'S TOP  DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN,  SENATORS MAX BAUCUS AND/OR AND ORRIN HATCH ARE ASKING THEIR SENATE  COLLEAGUES FOR SUGGESTIONS ON  THE NEW TAX CODE. WHAT SHOULD BE DEDUBT I BELIEVE? WHAT SHOULD THE TOP TAX RATE BE? BUT THESE SENATORS KNOW IT IS  TOO RISKY FOR THE OTHER SENATORS  TO BE PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR PUBLIC POLICY SO THEY ASSUREDDED  LAWMAKERS THAT ANY SUBMISSION  THEY RECEIVE WILL BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY BY THE COMMITTEE  AND THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES UNTIL  THE END OF 2064. THAT'S RIGHT. NO ONE WILL SEE THE SENATORS'  OPINIONS ON THE TAX CODE FOR 50  YEARS. AND BY THEN, FOLKS, THE SENATORS  WILL ALL BE DEAD. NOW, TO FURTHER GUARANTEE  PRIVACY, BAUCUS AND HATCH HAVE  OFFERED TO GIVE EACH SUBMISSION ITS OWN I.D. NUMBER, KEEP IT ON  PASSWORD-PROTECTED SERVERS AND  STORE PRINTEDDED VERSIONS IN LOCKED SAFES. THIS LEVEL OF SECRECY WILL GIVE  THE SENATORS THE FREEDOM TO DO  THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. THAT WAY, THEY CAN REPRESENT THE  VOTERS WITHOUT PRESSURE FROM THE  LOBBYISTS OR REPRESENT THE LOBBYISTS WITHOUT PRESSURE FROM  THE VOTERS. IT COULD GO EITHER WAY. WE'LL FIND OUT IN 2064. OF COURSE, THE ONLY DANGER IS IF  THE TAX BILL SOMEHOW LATER COMES  UP FOR A VOTE, THEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL BE IN THE PERILOUS  POSITION OF SUPPORTING THEIR OWN  IDEAS. WHICH IS IS WHY I BELIEVE WE  MUST OFFER CONGRESS EVEN MORE  SAFETY BY HIDING THEIR IDENTITIES IN THE LEGISLATIVE  PROTECTION PROGRAM. THIS WAY, THEY WILL BE GIVEN NEW  NAMES, NEW COVER JOBS. MITCH McCONNELL CAN NOW VOTE  HIS CONSCIENCE AS GREEK ORTHODOX  PRIEST MILOS MCCONNELOPOLOUS AND SO CAN HARRY REID OR SHOULD I  SAY SUSHI CHEF HARUKI REIDAMOTO. NOW AT SOME POINT FOLKS MIGHT  NOTICE ALL THESE PRIESTS AND  CHEFS HANGING AROUND THE CAPITOL BUILDING WHICH IS WHY WE MUST  RELOCATE CONGRESS SOMEWHERE  WHERE IT CAN NEVER BE FOUND, THOUSANDS OF MILES UNDER A  MOUNTAIN GUARDED BY RIVERS OF  MAGMA AND ARMED MOLE MEN. OF COURSE, TO ENSURE THE  ULTIMATE IN LEGISLATIVE PRIVACY,  WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE ALL VOTING BOOTHS TO HAVE REDACTED  BALLOTS. INSTEAD OF PULL AGO LEVER, YOU  JUST THROW A DART. NOW, I DON'T THINK AMERICANS  WOULD NOTICE A DIFFERENCE AT  THIS POINT BECAUSE IF OUR LAWMAKERS GET TO MAKE THEIR  POLICY SUGGESTIONS IN SECRET, WE  DON'T KNOW WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR  ANYWAY. AND THAT'S THE WORE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
