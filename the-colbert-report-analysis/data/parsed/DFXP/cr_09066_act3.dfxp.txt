Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN A  BOOK ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF  MAPS. RIGHT, THEY DESCENDED FROM  MONKEYS, TOO. PLEASE WELCOME SIMON GARFIELD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, SIR, YOU ARE THE  AWJOR OF SEVERAL BOOKS INCLUDING  THE BEST SELLING INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLING "JUST MY TYPE."  IT BLED LID OF TYPOGRAPHY.
IMPORTANT THING.
Stephen: WITHOUT TYPEO  GRAPY LED TO YOUR NEXT BOOK. THIS BOOK IS CALLED "ON THE MAP:   A MIND BLOWING EXPLORATION OF  THE WAY THE WORLD LOOKS."  WHY MAPS I HAVE GPS. WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT MAPS.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
IN A WAY --
Stephen: YOU ARE DOING WELL  RIGHT NOW, WATCH IT.
MAPS ARE OUR HISTORY REALLY. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR MOBILE  PHONE IN TEN YEARS TIME IT WILL  HAVE GOOGLE MAPS, APPLE MAPS, IF YOU ARE UNFORTUNATE. [ LAUGHTER ] BASICALLY, YOU WON'T KNOW  WHETHER WE DISCOVERED ANYTHING  NEW. THEY ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK  AT. EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS THE  SAME MAP.
Stephen: AND THEY WORK  REALLY WELL AND TELL ME WHERE TO  GO. WHY DOES A MAP HAVE TO BE AN  OBJECT OF ART?
ONE REASON YOU WOULDN'T BE  HERE NOW IN AMERICA BASICALLY. COLUMBUS DIDN'T HAVE GOOGLE  MAPS. HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO HIT,  YOU KNOW, JAPAN. AND --
Stephen: RIGHT, IF HE HAD  AK -- ACCURATE MAPS WE WOULD ALL  BE JAPANESE NOW. ARE YOU SAYING MAPS IN GENERAL  ARE A GOOD THING.
A FAN -- HE SAID NOT ALL  THOSE WHO WILL WONDER ALOFT. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT OLD MAPS. I LOVE THE IDEA OF DISCOVERING  NEW PLACES THROUGH ERROR. ONE THING I TALKED ABOUT IN THE  BOOK IS THESE MYTHICAL THINGS  THAT DON'T REALLY EXIST BUT WE SORT OF IMAGINED THEM ON MAPS. MAPS HELP US DREAM.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE  THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT OLD  MAPS. IS THAT THEY HAD THE SEA  SEARCHENTS OUT -- SERPENTS OUT  THERE WITH THE COILS AND  EVERYTHING. I DON'T SEE THOSE ON MAPS. IS IT OVERFISHING? WHY ARE THEY NOT ON THE MAP?
I MISS THEM, TOO. THE REASON THEY EXISTED ON OLD  MAPS BECAUSE PEOPLE THOUGHT WE  CAN'T ADMIT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LIES THIS LAND SO WE'RE GOING TO  PUT IN TERRIBLE BEASTS.
Stephen: HERE THEY BE  TIGERS IT WOULD SAY.
THE PHRASE HERE BE DRAGONS  DIDN'T ACTUALLY EXIST ON ANY  MAP. IT'S A MYTH. EXISTED ON THE GLOBE.
Stephen: A GLOBE IS NOT A  MAP?
IT'S NOT QUITE A MAP.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT?
A GLOBE IS --
Stephen: IT'S A ROUND MAP.
IT'S A ROUND MAP OKAY.
Stephen: YOU SAY THAT  TOLMPE IS A BAD ASS INCONSISTENT  MAP MAKING. WHAT MADE HIM SO INFLUENCEFUL?
HE DRAW THE ATLAS DIDN'T HAVE  THE MAPS JUST HAD WHAT COUNTRIES  LIE IN RELATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND WHAT VICINITIES  WERE IN RELATION TO OTHER  PLACES. HE WORKED ON THREE CONTINENTS.
Stephen: HOW ACCURATE WAS  IT AMONG THE THREE COULDN'T  NEVES.
WELL PRETTY. HE HAD THE SHAPES.
Stephen: IF YOU DON'T HAVE  AN AERIAL VIEW. HOW DID YOU GET SHAPES? DID A BLIND GO ON THE COAST GOES  IT'S BUMPY, IT DIPS OUT, BUMP,  BUMP, THAT'S THE HORN OF AFRICA. HOW DO YOU DO IT?
IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR GOLD  AND SILK, YOU WENT AROUND AND  NAVIGATED AND FOUND OUT THE SHAPE OF THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: YOU LITERALLY  REMEMBER EVERYTHING?
ABSOLUTELY WROTE THEM DOWN ON  MAPS. HE DID THE GREAT LIBRARY OF  ALEXANDRIA AND THEIR MAPS MAPS WERE  COMPLI CAIFLTD WITH THOSE MAPS COULD YOU BUILD AN ACCURATE VIEW  OF THE WORLD.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A  FAVORITE MAP?
IT'S OF LONDON, WHERE I'M  FROM, AND IT HAS THE T HAD, AMES  RUNNING THROUGH IT, HANDMADE ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO. ALL SORTS OF AREAS OF LONDON AND  ONE RED BLOG WHICH IS WEALTHY  AND THE REST OF THE MAP IS WRITTEN:  LOSERS. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: CAN YOU GET ME A  COPY OF THAT?
I SURE CAN.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. SIMON GARFIELD "ON
