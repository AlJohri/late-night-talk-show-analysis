STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, THERE ARE SO MANY AWFUL STORIES IN THE NEWS RIGHT NOW, AND WITH CHAOS AND VIOLENCE RAGING IN EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE, IT MAKES YOU WONDER, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO AL QAEDA? (LAUGHTER) TODAY, WE GOT AN ANSWER.
BREAKING OVERNIGHT, A NEW VIDEO FROM THE LEADER OF AL QUAIDA.
ACCORDING TO THE VIDEO ANNOUNCEMENT, AL QUAIDA IS VOWING TO BRING ISLAMIC LAW TO INDIA.
THE HEAD OF AL QUAIDA SAYS HE'S OPENING A NEW BRANCH IN INDIA.
STEPHEN: YES, AL QUAIDA'S OPENING A FRANCHISE IN INDIA. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE LIKE STARBUCKS, ONLY WITH LESS AMBITIOUS PLANS FOR GLOBAL DOMINATION. (LAUGHTER) THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME FROM LONGTIME AL QUAIDA LEADER AND JIHADI SMURF AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI, WHO RELEASED A VIDEO CALLING ON MUSLIMS ACROSS THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT TO JOIN THE "CARAVAN OF JIHAD." THAT CARAVAN IS EASY TO SPOT -- JUST LOOK FOR THE TRUCKS WITH 72 VIRGINS ON THE MUDFLAPS. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, I GET WHY AL QUAIDA IS OUTSOURCING TO INDIA -- THEY'RE A GLOBAL TERROR ORGANIZATION. THEY HAVE THEIR ONE TRUE PROPHET MARGINS TO THINK ABOUT, AND THEY HAVE BEEN RUNNING ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET FOR SO LONG, THEY'VE NEVER EVEN HAD A CHRISTMAS PARTY. (LAUGHTER) BUT I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE.
I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO RECLAIM SOME MANTEL OF LEADERSHIP HERE. I.S.I.S. WAS KICKED OUT OF AL QAEDA FOR BEING TOO BRUTAL, AND THEY'VE SORT OF TAKEN THE WORLD STAGE, AND EVERYONE'S   TALKING ABOUT THEM AND NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT AL QUAIDA, SO  THIS IS PROBABLY AT AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN SOME NOTORIETY.
STEPHEN: OOH OOH, SOMEONE'S JEAL-OUS OF I.S.I.S.! THEY'RE THE MYSTERIOUS NEW KID IN TOWN AND EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HIM. JUST LIKE KEVIN BACON IN FOOTLOOSE. ONLY I.S.I.S. WANTS TO OUTLAW DANCING -- AND BACON. (LAUGHTER) I.S.I.S. IS THE "IT" JIHADY GROUP RIGHT NOW. THEY'VE GOT AN ENTIRE CALIPHATE, WHILE ALL OF AYMAN'S GUYS ARE STILL DOING MONKEY BARS IN THE DESERT. THAT'S NOT A LONG-TERM PLAN! WHAT IF YOU TAKE OVER A CITY WITHOUT A JUNGLE GYM? HOW WILL YOU GET AROUND? WORSE, I.S.I.S. HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE ARENA MOST ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPPRESSIVE 17TH-CENTURY IDEOLOGUES, YOUTUBE.
WE ALL REMEMBER THOSE GRAINY AMATEURISH VIDEOS THAT BIN LADEN MADE THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SET UP BY SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN LONG-WINDED ARABIC THAT NOBODY IN THE WEST COULD UNDERSTAND. NOW WE HAVE I.S.I.S. ON TWITTER, ON INSTAGRAM, ON WHAT'S APP, THEY PRODUCE SLICK VIDEOS.
THEY'RE HIGHLY PRODUCED, THEY'VE GOT MUSIC, GRAPHICS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS PUT INTO THE SCREEN THAT ARE SOPHISTICATED AND TECHNICAL.
THEY'VE GOT YOUNG TECH-SAVVY GUYS DOING IT.
STEPHEN: YES, I.S.I.S. IS CRANKING OUT MORE VIRAL HITS THAN FUNNY OR DIE. (LAUGHTER) MINUS THE FIRST PART. (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, AL QUAIDA'S STILL MAILING OUT VHS TAPES OF "GRANDPA KILL-'EM-ALL" DRONING ON ABOUT "A FATWA ON PUDDING SKIN! "AND" DEATH TO WHOEVER CANCELED MATLOCK!" (LAUGHTER) YES! YES! THE TERRORISTS HAVE WON, BUT IT'S NOT YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
