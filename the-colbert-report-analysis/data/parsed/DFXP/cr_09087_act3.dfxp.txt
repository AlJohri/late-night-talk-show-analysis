(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT WON A TONY  AWARD AS THE EMCEE IN CABARET  BUT HE IS BEST KNOWN FOR BUSTING RHYMES IN THE MONSTER HIT SINGLE OOPSY DAISY HOMO PHONE. PLEASE WELCOME ALAN CUMMING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ï¿½r HEY, ALAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. LISTEN. YOU CLEAN UP REAL NICE.
YEAH. AS A SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR, THAT  WAS MY GAY URBAN LOOK FOR YOU
Stephen: YOU HAVE SO MUCH RAGE. A GAY URBAN TO SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR.
YES  Stephen: YOU AND I HAVE HEALED A NATION ALREADY TONIGHT. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER  PROJECT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. TONY-AWARD WINNER. STAGE, SCREEN. MUSICAL RECORDINGS. YOU'VE GOT A NEW C.D. THE HEAD THAT WEAR THE CROWNS SPEECHES FOR ROYAL MEN BY  WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE. I'VE GOT TO LEARN THOSE. MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE ON  BROADWAY RIGHT NOW IN AN  INCREDIBLE FEAT. YOU ARE DOING A ONE-MAN MACBETH. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NO  Stephen: YOU'RE NOT ON  BROADWAY.
TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN IT. Stephen: OUR ON BROADWAY PLAYING MACBETH AND 16 OTHER PARTS. IT'S LIKE 16 PARTS IN MACBETH.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY ONE MAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR
Stephen: I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE CALL THIS A ONE-MAN SHOW TOO. OKAY. WHY ARE YOU PLAYING SO MANY ROLES? IS THIS PENNY PINCHING? YOU ALSO RUN THE CONCESSION STAND. WHY SO MANY ROLES?
IT'S BECAUSE I'M PLAYING... WE HAVE THIS ADDED NARRATIVE ON  TOP OF OF MACBETH WHERE I'M A PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT WHO IS BROUGHT TO THIS UNIT AND HAS PSYCHOSIS DOING MACBETH. HE IS OBSERVED BY TWO OTHER PEOPLE
Stephen: DOES HE THINK HE'S ALL THESE CHARACTERS?
HE'S TELLING THE STORY. HE'S ACTING OUT THE STORY. BUT SOMEHOW HIS STORY OF WHY HE'S COME TO BE IN THAT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT AND THE STORY  OF MACBETH KIND OF FUSE AT A  CERTAIN POINT AND YOU LEARN THINGS ABOUT HIM
Stephen: CAN WE STAY MACBETH  OR DO WE HAVE THE SCOTTISH PLAY?
I SAY MACBETH. I THINK IT'S DOPEY
Stephen: YOU'RE FROM  SCOTLAND. YOU CAN SAY IT.
IN THE THEATER AND EVERYTHING... I JUST THINK... I  COULDN'T GET... TO BE PLAYING  LIKE ALL THESE PARTS TO HAVE TO SKIP SPIN AROUND, YOU HAD TO SWEAR AND SAY LIKE...
Stephen: REALLY? IT'S CABLE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?
(LAUGHING) Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BUT HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET. THIS WHOLE SHAKESPEARE THING. I DON'T USUALLY GO FOR THE ELITE HOYTY TO ITY SHOWS. I LIKE MY BROADWAY SHOWS TO BE ADAPTED FROM A REESE  WEATHERSPOON ROM-COM. WHY SHOULD WE STILL LISTEN TO SHAKESPEARE? WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO SAY TO US?
WELL, HE'S GOT A LOT TO SAY ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY, I THINK. HE ACTUALLY PREDATES MODERN PSYCHOLOGY. FREUD AND YUNG. THAT'S WHY WE ALSO MADE THIS SET  IN A PSYCHIATRIC UNIT TO EXPLORE ALL THAT. HE'S GOT AMAZINGLY ACCURATE AND INSIGHTFUL THINGS
Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND  WHY MACBETH IS UPSET BECAUSE HIS  WIFE JUST SAYS TO HIM, HEY, YOU SHOULD KILL THE KING TO BECOME KING. THAT'S JUST POLITICS. WHY DO YOU THINK MACBETH WIMPS  OUT SO MUCH WHEN LADY MACBETH  HAS GOT THE REAL, YOU KNOW.
GOING BACK TO FREUD HE SAID  THIS VERY INTERESTING THING ABOUT MACBETH. HE SAID THEY'RE REALLY TWO PARTS OF THE ONE PERSON. THEY MAKE UP A WHOLE PERSON. I HAVE SEX WITH MYSELF. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK A GREAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED THOSE PARTS. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. DO YOU WANT TO PLAY ANY OTHER DOUBLE ROLES. DO YOU WANT TO GO A ONE-MAN 12 ANGRY MAN. ROMEO AND JULIET?
ROMEO, I REALLY WANTED TO DO A PRODUCTION WHERE I PLAY  MACBETH ONE NIGHT AND LADY  MACBETH THE NEXT. IT'S ABOUT MASK LINT
Stephen: THE WHOLE PLAY IS  PLAY IS FOUR HOURS OF SPEAKS PEER.
THE GIRLS ARE GOING SHOW US YOUR BALLS. THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT. IN ROMEO AND JULIET. THAT'S A COMMON THING FOR ACTORS TO DO. I THINK I'VE DONE IT NOW. THIS HAPPENED BY ACCIDENT. IT'S BECOME SORT OF A, YOU KNOW,  A FEAT FOR ME TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS. I THINK WHEN THIS ONE IS FINISHED IT WILL BE A TIME TO DO  A PLAY WHERE I HAVE... I CAN'T  LIKE COUGH OR FART OR ANYTHING. IT'S REALLY REALLY... I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY. IMAGINE AN HOUR AND 40 MINUTES  WHEN YOU CAN'T SWALLOW OR COUGH OR BURP OR FART. IMAGINE.
Stephen: REMIND ME NOT TO GO  TO A DINNER PARTY WITH YOU. ALAN CUMMING, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. THE PLAY IS MACBETH. THE MAN IS ALAN CUMMING AND THE  CD IS THE HEAD THAT WEARS THE CROWN. WE'LL BE RIGHT
