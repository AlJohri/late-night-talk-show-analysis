[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SOP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES. IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW  IT. I BELIEVE THAT  CHILDREN ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS  RESOURCE. THAT'S WHY I ADVOCATE PLANTING  TEN NEW ONES FOR EVERY ONE WE  HARVEST. [LAUGHTER] AND I'M ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT  FOR THREATS TO OUR CHILDREN. WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT I'M  INTRODUCING MY NEW SEGMENT  "STEPHEN COLBERT IS WATCHING YOUR KIDS!" [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO  OUR OUR YOUNGLINGS IS EXPOSURE  TO INDECENT MATERIAL. SO I WAS APPALLED TO HEAR ABOUT  A FILTHY MUSEUM EXHIBIT IN  CANADA. SEE, THE VANCOUVER MARITIME  MUSEUM HAS A NEW EXHIBIT CALLED  "TATTOOS AND SCRIMSHAW: THE ART OF THE SAILOR," WHICH FEATURES  NINE EROTIC ENGRAVINGS MADE ON  THE TEETH OF SPERM WHALES IN THE 19th CENTURY, OR AS ONE  CONCERNED PARENT CALLS IT  "WHALE BONE PORN"! INCIDENTALLY, TO GET YOUR WHALE  BONE  PORN NAME, TAKE A NAME  FROM THE FIRST LINE OF YOUR FAVORITE WHALING NOVEL AND  COMBINE IT WITH YOUR  FAVORITE DISH AT RED LOBSTER. SO MY WHALE BONE PORN NAME  IS "ISHMAEL UNLIMITED SHRIMP." [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WE TURN  TO CTV NEWS, CANADA'S WHALE PORN  NEWS LEADER.
VANCOUVER'S MARITIME MUSEUM  WANTED TO SHOW WHAT SAILORS ON  WHALING SHIPS OFTEN LONG FOR WHEN FAR FROM HOME BUT THE  TATTOOS AND SAILING EXHIBITS  SHOWED A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ONE  MOTHER. WHALE EROTICA THAT ANN PIMENTEL  SAYS SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN WARNED  ABOUT.
I WAS APPALLED. I HAD MY TWO SONS WITH ME IT  WASN'T ON THEIR WEBSITE. THERE WERE NO SIGNS WHEN I  PURCHASED THE TICKETS FOR MY  FAMILY.
Stephen: FOLKS, IF CHILDREN  SEE THIS HARPOON-TANG IT WILL  GIVE THEM IDEAS. [LAUGHTER] THAR SHE BLOWS! [LAUGHTER] NOW, INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH  THE HASSLE OF FINDING NAKED  PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET, YOUNGSTERS ARE SIMPLY GOING TO  SIMPLY HEAD TO THE WHARVES, SIGN  UP FOR A TWO-YEAR WHALING EXPEDITION, HARPOON A HUMPBACK,  RENDER ITS BLUBBER INTO  LAMP OIL, AND THEN SPEND THE NEXT TWO MONTHS PAINSTAKINGLY  CARVING EROTIC IMAGERY INTO THE  WHALE'S BLEACHED BONES, JUST SO THEY CAN GET THEIR ROCKS OFF. SO PARENTS, BE ON THE LOOKOUT  FOR STRANGE BEHAVIOR. THE NEXT TIME JUNIOR'S IN THE  BATHROOM TOO LONG, KNOCK ON THE  DOOR AND SHOUT, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE, YOUNG MAN? ARE YOU ENGAGING IN THE ANCIENT  MARITIME ART OF SCRIMSHAW? OH NO? THEN WHY DID I FIND THIS BOTTLE  OF 19th CENTURY TOBACCO JUICE  THAT WHALERS USED TO DARKEN THEIR ENGRAVINGS UNDER YOUR  MATTRESS? ANSWER ME!" [LAUGHTER] AND PARENTS, IF YOU HAVE A  COLLECTION OF WHALE-BONE  PORNOGRAPHY OF YOUR OWN, MAKE SURE IT'S PASSWORD-PROTECTED. DON'T USE QUEEQUEG-- WAY TOO  OBVIOUS. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
