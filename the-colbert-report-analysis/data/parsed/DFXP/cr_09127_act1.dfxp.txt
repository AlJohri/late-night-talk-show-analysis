STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH A GREETING LIKE THAT, I  FEEL LIKE I JUST WALKED INTO A  SURPRISE PARTY. BIG STORY TONIGHT, EVERYBODY. OVER 500 AL QAEDA LEADERS HAVE  ESCAPED FROM ABU GHRAIB PRISON  IN IRAQ AND WITH IRAQ FACING OVER A THOUSAND SECTARIAN  KILLINGS A MONTH, EXPERTS FEAR  THE COUNTRY IS PLUNGING ONCE AGAIN INTO A BLOODY CIVIL WAR. FOR MORE, GO SOME PLACE ELSE  BECAUSE THERE'S A ROYAL BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOR YET ANOTHER GENERATION, THE  ROYAL FAMILY WAS NOT RENDERED  STERILE THROUGH INBREEDING. WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR YET  ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF.
STEPHEN COLBERT PRESENTS  "ROYAL AFTER BIRTH: LABOR PARTY. FETAL ATTRACTION. BIRTHING-HIPS HOORAH: THE PRINCE  OF WAILS:
Stephen: THIS AFTERNOON THE  ROYAL COUPLE FINALLY EMERGED  HOLDING THE YET AS UNNAMED NEW  PRINCE-CAMBRIDGE. OF COURSE KATE'S A TREND SETTER. LADIES, THIS IS THE NEW STANDARD  FOR WHAT YOU MUST LOOK LIKE LESS  THAN 24 HOURS AFTER GIVING BIRTH: SMILING, GLAMOROUS, HAIR  PERFECT, RADIANT AND FRESH. OKAY. STEP UP YOUR GAME. ONCE THE BABY WAS OUT, IT WAS  TIME FOR THE COUPLE TO GO HOME.
THEY'RE COMING OUT AGAIN. LIKE EVERY MODERN PARENT NOW,  YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR CAR SEAT  READY. I'M ALSO IMPRESSED BY HOW THIS  BABY IS ABLE TO HANDLE ALL OF  THE NOISE.
WILLIAM IS GOING TO DRIVE THE  RANGE HOME. THAT IS SO COOL.
Reporter: THAT IS SO COOL. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I MUST SAY AS A TRADITIONALIST,  I AM DISAPPOINTED THEY DIDN'T  TAKE THE BABY HOME ON  PEASANT-BACK. OF COURSE THERE ARE STILL MAJOR  QUESTIONS LEFT UNANSWERED WHAT  WILL HIS NAME BE? WE KNOW IT HAS A HEAD BUT WHAT  WILL BE ON THAT HEAD? A FACE?
THE CHILD IS LIKELY TO HAVE  KATE'S EYES, DARK HAIR AND  DARKER SKIN. AND WILL'S LIPS AND ROYAL NOSE,  ALSO SEEN ON PRINCE PHILIP,  CHARLES AND HARRY.
Stephen: MAYBE, BUT WE HEAR  AT THE REPORT HAVE OUR OWN  COMPUTER-GENERATED SPECUJECTION OF WHAT THE BABY MIGHT LOOK LIKE  IF HE GETS THE QUEEN'S EYES,  PRINCE CHARLES' EARS AND AN ENGLISHMAN'S TEETH. THEY'RE SO CUTE AT THAT AGE. NATION, EVER SINCE GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN WAS ACQUITTED, WE  HAVEN'T SEEN HIDE NOR HAIR OF  HIM. LIKE MOST WINNERS, I ASSUMED HE  HAD GONE TO DISNEY WORLD. WELL, IT TURNS OUT HE WAS BACK  ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN COMES OUT OF  HIDING JUST IN TIME TO PLAY HERO  JUST FOUR DAYS AFTER BEING ACQUITTED IN THE SHOOTING DEATH  OF TRAYVON MARTIN, ZIMMERMAN  CAME ACROSS A FLIPPED-OVER S.U.V. IN THE SANFORD, FLORIDA,  AREA. HE AND ANOTHER PERSON HELPED THE  FAMILY GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE. ZIMMERMAN STAYED ON SCENE UNTIL  EMERGENCY CREWS ARRIVED. HE THEN SIMPLY LEFT.
Stephen: IT MAY BE THE FIRST  TIME ANYONE HAS EVER SAID, "I'M  SURE GLAD GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WAS FOLLOWING ME."  AND IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE PEOPLE  WHO BELIEVES HE SHOULD BE IN  JAIL, THAT MEANS THAT YOU WISH THAT FAMILY WAS STILL TRAPPED IN  THEIR BURNING CAR. WHO'S THE MONSTER NOW? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT: IT'S YOU. OF COURSE AFTER THE TRIAL I HAD  HOPED THAT AMERICANS COULD JUST  LOCK OUR DOORS AND SPEED THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF RACIAL  TENSION, BUT IF ANYTHING, RACIAL  TENSIONS ARE NOW WORSE THAN  EVER. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ONLY  A FEW YEARS AGO, BLACK AND WHITE  AMERICANS PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES TO HUNT ALIENS. HOW DID WE FORGET THAT SO SOON? ALL RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT, YEAH. LAST WEEK IN A SURPRISE  APPEARANCE IN THE WHITE HOUSE  PRESS ROOM, PRESIDENT OBAMA WEIGHED IN WITH HIS PERSONAL  EXPERIENCE, EMPATHIZING WITH  THOSE WHO SEE THE EVENTS OF THIS CASE AS EMBLEMATIC OF THE BLACK  EXPERIENCE.
THERE ARE VERY FEW  AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN IN THIS  COUNTRY WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING FOLLOWED  WHEN THEY WERE SHOPPING IN A  DEPARTMENT STORE. THAT INCLUDES ME.
Stephen: IT'S TRUE. EVEN AS PRESIDENT, EVERYWHERE HE  GOES, HE'S FOLLOWED BY COPS. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S IN HIS  LIMOSINE. MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S BLACK. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SAD. AND, FOLKS, HE WANT TO SAY THAT  HIS WORDS TOUCHED ME BECAUSE I  TOO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED AROUND IN DEPARTMENT STORES. EVERY TIME I WALK INTO A  NORDSTROM'S, I'M APPROACHED BY  CLERKS OFFERING TO HELP ME FIND THE TOMMY BAHAMA COLLECTION. WHY? JUST BECAUSE I'M WHITE AND I'M  GOING TO BUY SOMETHING IN A  LOOSE-FITTING BREEZY PLAYED? I AM BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THANKFULLY THERE'S A WAY TO  ACHIEVE RACIAL HARMONY. AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF  TONIGHT'S WORD. COLOR BIND. NATION, IT'S TIME WE  CAUCASIAN-AMERICANS ACCEPT THAT  WHEN IT COMES TO FURTHERING THE RACIAL DIALOGUE THE BALL IS IN  OUR COURT EVEN THOUGH HAVING THE  BALL ON A COURT HAS NEVER BEEN OUR STRONG SUIT. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TAKEN THE  FIRST STEP BY FRANKLY DISCUSSING  AS A BLACK MAN HOW IT FEELS TO BE IN A ROOM FULL OF WHITE  PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED OF HIM. NOW I BELIEVE IT'S MY TURN TO BE  HONEST ABOUT THE WHITE  EXPERIENCE. BLACK PEOPLE ARE SCARY. AND, FOLKS, THAT'S NOT JUST ME  SAYING THAT. I MEAN, JUST ASK THE TV.
HERE IS THE HEADLINE. YOUNG BLACK MEN COMMIT HOMICIDES  AT A RATE 10 TIMES GREATER THAN  WHITES AND HISPANICS COMBINED.
HERE'S AN INCONVENIENT FACT. ANY TIME THERE'S INTERRACIAL  CRIME, THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING  CHANCE THAT THE VICTIM IS GOING TO BE WHITE AND THAT THE  CRIMINAL IS GOING TO BE BLACK.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CRIME  NUMBERS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS --  THIS IS ASTONISHING -- AFRICAN-AMERICANS MAKE UP 13% OF  THE POPULATION, BUT COMMIT MORE  THAN HALF THE MURDERS IN THIS  COUNTRY.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT  PREJUDICE. THAT'S JUST MATH. SO IF IN 2011 OUT OF 42 MILLION  AFRICAN-AMERICANS, 4,149 WERE  ARRESTED FOR MURDER WHICH MEANS WE CAN REASONABLY BE SCARED OF  9/1,000ths OF ONE PERCENT  OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS. NOW, DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT. UNTIL YOU CONSIDER... UNTIL YOU  CONSIDER THAT WE DON'T KNOW  WHICH 9/1,000th OF ONE  PERCENT. SO, TO BE SAFE, WE HAVE TO BE  SCARED OF ALL OF THEM. FOLKS, IT'S THE SAME REASON... FOLKS, THIS IS THE SAME REASON I  ASSUME ALL ARABS ARE TERRORISTS  AND ALL IRISHMEN ARE  LEPRECHAUNS. I'M GOING TO GET YOUR POT OF  GOLD, DANIEL DAY LEWIS. NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU'RE SAYING, "STEPHEN, THAT'S  OUTRAGEOUS. WITH THOSE NUMBERS, IT MAKES NO  SENSE TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF ALL  BLACK PEOPLE. YOU SHOULD ONLY BE SUSPICIOUS OF  BLACK MEN."  FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T BELIEVE  YOU JUST SAID THAT ON NATIONAL  TELEVISION. SECOND OF ALL, OKAY, YOU'RE  WRONG. WE HAVE TO BE SCARED OF BLACK  WOMEN TOO BECAUSE THANKS TO  HOLLYWOOD, I KNOW THAT MANY BLACK WOMEN ARE ACTUALLY BLACK  MEN. SO NOW, OKAY, NOW THAT I'VE DONE  THIS IN THE DIALOGUE OF RACIAL  UNDERSTANDING, WHITE PEOPLE HAVE DONE OUR PART. OKAY. WE HAVE SHOWN THE COURAGE TO  ADMIT WE'RE TERRIFIED, BUT IT'S  A TWO-WAY STREET, BLACK PEOPLE. WHICH IS WHY RIGHT NOW I WOULD  LIKE TO ADDRESS ALL MY  AFRICAN-AMERICAN VIEWERS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO  CHANGE HOW WHITE PEOPLE FEEL  ABOUT YOU AND ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE'S A SIMPLE  WAY YOU CAN DO IT.
AND THERE ARE VERY FEW  AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN WHO HAVEN'T  HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF WALKING ACROSS THE STREET AND HEARING  THE LOCKS CLICK ON THE DOORS OF  CARS. THAT HAPPENED TO ME, AT LEAST  BEFORE I WAS A SENATOR.
Stephen: SO THE ANSWER IS  OBVIOUS. BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO BECOME  SENATORS. ONCE YOU'RE ELECTEDDED TO THE  SENATE, NO ONE'S GOING TO THINK  YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO  THEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLUS BLACK MEN CAMPAIGNING'S IS  EASY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KNOCK ON A  LOT OF STRANGERS' DOORS. WHAT COULD GO WRONG? AND BELIEVE ME, ONCE YOU'VE  LAUNCHEDDED YOUR POLITICAL  CAREER, MAYBE SOME DAY YOU TOO CAN BE PRESIDENT. THEN YOU'LL NEVER INSPIRE  IRRATIONAL FEAR IN WHITE PEOPLE  AGAIN. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT
