STEPHEN: TONIGHT, WHO IS INFLUENCING THE SUPREME COURT? FASHIONWISE, I SAY DRUIDS. THEN A SURPRISING WEAPON IN THE FIGHT AGAINST EBOLA YOU ARM WHITE BLOOD CELLS WITH GUNS AND GIVE THE VIRUS A HOODIE AND MY GUEST JAMES MCPHERSON HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT JEFFERSON DAVIS  OR AS I CALL HIM THE LINCOLN OF SLAVERY. INVESTIGATORS FOUND I.S.I.S. USED AMMUNITION FROM 21 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES INCLUDING CHINA. OH, NO! SOME OF THOSE BULLETS MIGHT CONTAIN LEAD! THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY     COMEDY CENTRAL (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN:  WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! IN HERE OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! NATION, TODAY IS THE FIRST MONDAY IN OCTOBER, THE START OF THE SUPREME COURT'S NEW SESSION, AND I AM PUMPED TO THE GAVELS. IT'S LIKE THE START OF FOOTBALL SEASON, ONLY, UNLIKE THE N.F.L., THESE PLAYERS ACTUALLY GO TO COURT. (LAUGHTER) AND RIGHT HERE ON DAY ONE, THE COURT'S ALREADY DECIDED ON A HUGE NON-DECISION.
THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID IT WILL NOT HEAR ANY OF THE SEVEN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE CASES THAT WERE FILED OVER THE SUMMER.
NOW THE LOWER COURT RULINGS STAND.
IN MOST OF THESE JURISDICTIONS NOW, SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WILL BE DE FACTO LEGAL.
NOW WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE 30 STATES HAVE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIVE IN A STATE WITH SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
THE MOMENTUM WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS LEGAL MAKES IT INEVITABLE, IT SEEMS, THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW.
STEPHEN: INEVITABLE THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW. WELL, I GUESS THAT'S IT. (LAUGHTER) I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK MY WIFE LORRAINE FOR 25 GOOD YEARS. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WHAT CAN I SAY? WE GAVE IT A GOOD SHOT, HONEY. AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET A PHOTO OF YOU. AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME MY NEW GOVERNMENT-MANDATED LIFE PARTNER ROGER CORNSWORTH. (LAUGHTER) ROG AND I ARE REGISTERED AT RESTORATION HARDWARE. WE'RE DOING OUR ENTIRE LIVING ROOM IN HAMMERED STAINLESS STEEL. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOR NOW, FOLKS, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CASES THAT THE COURT HAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO HEAR. SPECIFICALLY, HOW THEY WILL BE ARRIVING AT THEIR DECISIONS. I READ ALL ABOUT IT IN THE VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW. I'M A LONG-TIME SUBSCRIBER. I USE IT TO HIDE MY HUSTLERS. THE ARTICLE WAS BY WILLIAM AND MARY SCHOOL OF LAW PROFESSOR ALLISON ORR LARSEN. IN IT, ALLISON, OR LARSEN, I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS, BLOWS THE LID OFF THE SUPREME COURT'S RELIANCE ON SOMETHING CALLED AMICUS CURIAE OR FRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEFS, INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS WRITTEN BY THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE SITUATION, WHOSE OPINION WAS NOT SOUGHT, BUT STILL WANT SOME SAY IN THE DECISION. IT'S THE LEGAL EQUIVALENT OF GRANDPARENTS. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SOME ESTABLISHED EXPERT TO INFLUENCE THE COURT. FOR INSTANCE, IN A 2013 DECISION, JUSTICE STEPHEN G. BREYER CITED AN AMICUS BRIEF TO ESTABLISH THAT AMERICAN LIBRARIES HOLD 200 MILLION BOOKS THAT WERE PUBLISHED ABROAD... THE FIGURE CAME FROM A BLOG POST. THE BLOG HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT IF IT'S DISCONTINUED? I GET ALL MY LEGAL RESEARCH FROM CACHED GEOCITIES PAGES. FROM THE 1990S! (LAUGHTER) THAT'S HOW I KNOW -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S HOW I KNOW IT IS MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO GET JIGGY WID GILLIAN ANDERSON. (LAUGHTER) AND IN CARHART V. GONZALES, JUSTICE KENNEDY WROTE THAT WOMEN WHO GET ABORTIONS CAN SUFFER SEVERE DEPRESSION AND LOSS OF ESTEEM. QUOTING AN AMICUS BRIEF CITING THE WORK OF DR. DAVID REARDON, WHO IS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WHO HOLDS A PH.D. IN BIOETHICS FROM AN UNACCREDITED AND NOW NON-EXISTENT SCHOOL IN HAWAII. (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) WELL, I SAY ITS LACK OF EXISTENCE IS IRRELEVANT, AND I HAVE A DOCTORATE IN EXISTENTIAL PHILOSOPHY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NARNIA ONLINE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) AND THESE ARE NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS, ACCORDING TO LARSEN. THE NUMBER OF AMICUS CURIAE BRIEFS FILED AT THE SUPREME COURT IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. AND FROM 2008 TO 2013, THE COURT'S OPINIONS CITED FACTUAL ASSERTIONS FROM AMICUS BRIEFS 124 TIMES. WELL, AS A WISE MAN ONCE SAID, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH QUOTING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT? I DID. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) BUT I SAY WHY LIMIT THE COURT TO AMICUS BRIEFS WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY SOURCES FOR UNVERIFIED FACTS? WHAT ABOUT SNAPPLE CAPS? (LAUGHTER) YOUR HONOR, ALABAMA SEEKS A PRECEDENT IN ITS ABILITY TO REDRAW CONGRESSIONAL VOTING DISTRICTS BECAUSE... EMUS CAN'T WALK BACKWARDS. (LAUGHTER) TASTES LIKE THE TRUTH. CLEARLY, AMICUS BRIEFS ARE THE GREATEST THING TO HAPPEN TO JURISPRUDENCE SINCE THE CASE OF SLICED V. BREAD. HERE TO TELL ME WHY THEY'RE NOT IS PROFESSOR ALLISON ORR LARSEN. THERE'S YOUR FANCY VIRGINA LAW REVIEW. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH AMICUS BRIEFS BEING FILED WITH THE COURT? IT LITERALLY MEANS BEING FRIENDLY.
THE TROUBLE IS TODAY ANYBODY CAN BE A FACTUAL EXPERT OR CLAIM TO BE.
STEPHEN: EXACTLY RIGHT, BECAUSE IF IT FEELS LIKE A FACT, IT IS A FACT. (LAUGHTER)
BUT IF ALL THOSE ASSERTIONS ARE MADE TO THE COURT IN DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRIEFS, IT'S HARD TO TELL WHICH ARE RELIABLE AND WHICH ARE NOT.
STEPHEN: BUT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MERELY READ THE AMICUS BRIEFS THAT AGREE WITH YOU AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR OPINION.
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE USUALLY, IN THE LAW, WE HAVE TWO SIDES FIGHTING IT OUT AND THE JUDGE PICKS WHICH IS THE MOST RELIABLE OF THE EXPERTS BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WHEN THEY'RE COMING IN AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR AND UNTESTED AND THEY'RE SUPPORTING A PRE-EXISTING POINT OF VIEW.
STEPHEN: COMING IN AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR, IS THAT LIKE BIDDING IN THE LAST FIVE SECONDS ON EBAY?
A LITTLE LIKE THAT, EXCEPT BIGGER IMPLICATIONS.
STEPHEN: REALLY? HAVE YOU EVER BID ON A TROLL DOLL? IT GETS PRETTY VICIOUS. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) WHAT ARE THESE AMICUS BRIEFS SUPPOSED TO BE? IF THEY'RE NOT WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, WHAT WAS THE GOLDEN STANDARD.
THEY WERE ORIGINALLY CALLED FRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEFS A LONG TIME AGO, WHEN A LAWYER IN THE COURT WOULD HELP THE COURT OUT WITH A QUESTION OF LAW THAT HE WANTED TO KNOW.
STEPHEN: THEY WOULD BE BATTLING AN ISSUE AND LOOK AROUND AND SAY, IS THIS A LAWYER HERE?
YES.
STEPHEN: REALLY? IS THERE A LAWYER IN THE HOUSE?
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT WAY IN A LONG TIME.
STEPHEN: THAT'S HOW IT STARTED OUT?
IT STARTED OUT THAT WAY. IT HASN'T BEEN THAT WAY IN A LONG TIME. NOW THEY'RE FILED BY MOTIVATED GROUPS, PEOPLE WITH A DOG IN THE FIGHT.
STEPHEN: WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT A MOTIVATED PERSON IN WHAT'S THE DOWN SIDE?
THE DOWN SIDE IS IF YOU AREN'T TESTING THAT, LIKE WHEN YOU WANT AN EXPERT WITNESS AT TRIAL, YOU DON'T LET ANYBODY COME TO THE COURTHOUSE STEPS TO TESTIFY.
STEPHEN: ANYBODY WHO AGREES WITH ME.
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. THERE'S SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR DECIDING WHO CAN BE THE REAL EXPERT AT THAT POINT IN TIME.
STEPHEN: SO WHO ARE THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBMITTING THESE? ARE THESE LOBBYISTS?
NO, THERE IS ORGANIZATIONS CREATED TO LOBBY AND ALSO TO FILE AMICUS BRIEFS, TOO, IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ORGANIZATION.
STEPHEN: I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE YOU'VE GOT HERE. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PEDIATRICS AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS TAKE OPPOSITE POSITIONS ON ADOPTION OF CHILDREN BY GAY COUPLES.
RIGHT.
STEPHEN: WHICH ONE OF THEM IS RELIABLE?
WELL, IT'S HARD TO TELL, RIGHT?
STEPHEN: WHICH ONE IS AGAINST ADOPTION OF CHILDREN BY GAY COUPLES?
THAT WOULD BE THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PEDIATRICS.
STEPHEN: SOUNDS LIKE GOOD FOLKS. (LAUGHTER) SO BOTH THESE ORGANIZATIONS COULD SUBMIT A FRIEND-OF-THE-COURT BRIEF AND THE JUSTICES HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WHICH ONE HAS ALREADY MADE UP THEIR DECISION IS ESSENTIALLY A LOBBYING ORGANIZATION?
YOU'RE LOOKING TO SUPPORT FACTS OF SOMETHING YOU ALREADY BELIEVE ANYWAY.  IT'S A CONVENIENCE AND YOU PICK THE BRIEF THAT FITS YOUR PREEXISTING VIEW.
STEPHEN: WHICH JUSTICES DO THIS MORE THAN OTHERS?
THEY ALL DO IT. THEY ALL CITE AMICUS BRIEFS. SOME COMPLAIN WHEN THEIR COLLEAGUES DO IT.
STEPHEN: DO THEY STILL DO IT THEMSELVES, THOUGH?
YES.
STEPHEN: WHO IS THAT? DOES SCALIA DO IT? DOES SCALIA COMPLAIN ABOUT IT?
HE DOES COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.
STEPHEN: BUT DOES HE DO IT, ANYWAY?
HE HAS DONE IT.
STEPHEN: AH, THAT'S ANTONIN! THANK YOU SO MUCH. (APPLAUSE) PROFESSOR ALLISON ORR LARSEN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
