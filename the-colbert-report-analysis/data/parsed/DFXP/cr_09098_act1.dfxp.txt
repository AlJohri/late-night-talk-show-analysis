FOLKS, I AM INTERRUPTING  TONIGHT'S REGULARLY SCHEDULED  BROADCAST TO BRING YOU BREAKING  NEWS. REPEAT: TONIGHT'S COLBERT REPORT  WILL NOT BE SEEN BECAUSE THERE  HAS BEEN A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE  TRAGIC ATTACK ON OUR EMBASSY IN  BENGHAZI, LIBYA. SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER, FOX NEWS  HAS BEEN PURSUING THIS STORY  DOGGEDLY TO UNCOVER HOW THE ADMINISTRATION BLEW IT, WHEN  THEY BLEW IT, WHY THEY BLEW IT,  AND HOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE BLOWN IT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOW IS  THIS CAR STILL BURNING? I MEAN IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOR GOD'S SAKE, THE MACCABEES'  OIL ONLY LASTED EIGHT DAYS. IF THAT ISN'T SUSPICIOUS, IT'S  AT LEAST MIRACULOUS. WELL, BUCKLE UP, FOLKS. CLICK-CLICK. BECAUSE, THIS STORY IS ABOUT TO  TAKE OFF LIKE A ROCKETSHIP TO  PLANET SCANDAL TOWN.
THE TENSION IS MOUNTING IN  THE NATION'S CAPITAL. THAT'S WHERE IN JUST ONE DAY, WE  WILL HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF THREE  WHITTLE BLOWERS ABOUT THE BENGHAZI TERROR ATTACK.

IT'S GOING TO BE EXPLOSIVE. EXPLOSIVE.  INDEED. THESE ARE BIG, BIG CHARGES.
THE DAM IS ABOUT TO BREAK ON  BENGHAZI. IT WILL MAKE YOU MAD.
Stephen: IT'S GOING TO MAKE  ME MAD? OH, I FEEL LIKE A KID ON  CHRISTMAS EVE WHO IS ABOUT TO  GET THE BIKE HE ASKED FOR... AND IT'S ON FIRE. SO, JUST WHAT ARE THESE WHISTLE  BLOWERS GOING TO SAY?
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE GUYS  ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY.
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS THE  BEST POSSIBLE KIND OF POLITICAL  STORY. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S IN IT AND  IT'S GOING TO BE EXPLOSIVE. IT'S THE TACO BELL OF BREAKING  NEWS. SO, JIM,... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I CAN MAKE A RUN FOR THE BORDER. SO, JIM, LET'S START THE  BENGHAZI COUNT DOWN TO SOMETHING  THAT WILL MAKE YOU MAD CLOCK. FOLKS, IT IS GREAT.

I'M JUST TRYING OUT MY NEW  GOOGLE GLASSES. I HAD TO MAKE MY OWN BECAUSE  SERGEY BRIN, THE COFOUNDER OF  GOOGLE, DIDN'T SEND ME A PAIR. NO BIG DEAL. THESE WORK JUST AS WELL. GOOGLE GLASSES. WHAT'S FOUR PLUS FOUR? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I CAN'T SEE THE ANSWER BECAUSE I  DON'T HAVE MY GLASSES ON. SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW. YOU SEE, SERGEY BRIN HAILS FROM  THE SUBJECT OF THE 69th  INSTALLMENT OF MY 343-PART SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. TONIGHT MARYLAND FOURTH, THE  FIGHTIN' FOURTH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE FOURTH IS THE FIRST BLACK  SUB URBAN DISTRICT IN THE  COUNTRY MAKING IT IS THE JACKIE ROBINSON OF NEVER RETURNING YOUR  NEIGHBOR'S WE'DWACKER. IT IS ALSO THE FIRST SUBURB EVER  TO BE PULLED OVER BY THE COPS. MARYLAND'S FOURTH ALSO HOUSES  ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, HOME TO  THE PRESIDENT'S JUM BE JET AIR FORCE ONE ALTHOUGH AFTER  SEQUESTER CUTS IT'S BEEN  DOWNGRADED TO HONDA CIVIC FORCE  ONCE. MARYLAND'S FOURTH ALSO INCLUDES  FED-EX FIELD HOME OF THE  WASHINGTON REDSKINS, THE MOST OFFENSIVE TAME IN PROFESSIONAL  SPORTS OTHER THAN THE ARIZONA  ASIAN KIDS ARE GOOD AT MATHS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, SOME CELEBRITIES... SOME  ARIZONA FANS HERE TONIGHT. SOME CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE LIVED  IN THE FOURTH INCLUDE SUGAR RAY  LEONARD AND WHEEL OF FORTUNE HOST... OH, WHAT IS HIS NAME? JIMMY, GIVE ME A CLUE. OKAY. I ANT TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE. FAT SAJAM AND WHO HAS THE  OVERNIGHT PACKAGE TO REPRESENT  THIS DISTRICT? WHY, IT'S NONE OTHER THAN THIRD  TERM DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN  DONNA ED WARYDZ. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE  EDWARDS IN HER WASHINGTON  OFFICE. CONGRESSMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE.
YOU ARE CONGRESSWOMAN DONNA  EDWARDS. CAN I CALL YOU ED?
YOU CAN CALL ME DONNA. ED, TELL ME ABOUT THE  FIGHTIN' FOURTH.
IT'S THE HOME TO ANDREWS AIR  FORCE BASE WHICH IS WHERE THE  PRESIDENT LANDS HIS PLANES AND THE HOME TO A LOT OF FEDERAL  WORKERS. A GREAT CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.
YOUR DISTRICT IS THE FIRST IN  THE COUNTRY WITH AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAJORITY.
IT'S A WONDERFULLY DIVERSE  DISTRICT. WE DO HAVE AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN  MAJORITY.
Stephen: I DON'T SEE RACE. I'VE EVOLVED BEYOND THAT, YOU  KNOW. I JUST PRETEND EVERYBODY IS  WHITE AND IT'S ALL GOOD.
THAT WORKS FOR YOU. EN THERE'S NO RACISM. AT PROBABLY WOULDN'T WORK  FOR ME.
WHY NOT? BECAUSE I'M BLACK. Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT  UNTIL YOU JUST TOLD ME. YOU SEE, NOW YOU'RE THE PROBLEM.
NO SNED MA I CALL YOU SISTER  EDWARDS.
YOU CAN CALL ME DONNA. EDDIE, YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF  YOU CAN LEUM WARM ON ISRAEL. DO YOU SUPPORT A TWO-STATE  SOLUTION.
I DO. TWO ISRAELS. NO, A PALESTINIAN STATE. WE NEED A SPARE ISRAEL MAYBE  UP IN LEB NOBODY JUST IN CASE  SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE FIRST STATE OF ISRAEL.
A SECURE ISRAEL AND A  PALESTINIAN STATE.
BUT THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE. WHICH SLOPE IS THAT? THE PALESTINIAN STATE. WHAT'S NEXT? GAY MARRIAGE?
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. SO THE GAYS LOVE. THEY LOVE IT SLIPPERY. SPEAKING OF SLIPPERY SLOPE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE THREE STATES  THAT VOTED TO BAN STRAIGHT  MARRIAGE. WHAT HAS THAT DONE TO MARRIAGE  IN YOUR STATE.
WE DID NOT VOTE TO BAN STATE  MARRIAGE. WE MADE MARRIAGE MORE INCLUSIVE  IN MARYLAND. WE SAID ANYONE CAN GET MARRIED.
WHAT DOES MARRIED MEAN? MARRIED MEANS LIVING  TOGETHER, COMMITTED TO EACH  OTHER OVER A LONG PERIOD OF  TIME. IN A HOUSEHOLD FOR A LIFETIME.
A GUY AND A DOG. I'M COMMITTED TO MY DOG.
I HAVE A 20-YEAR-OLD CAT BUT  WE'RE NOT MARRIED.
WOULD YOU LET ANYTHING HAPPEN  TO YOUR CAT. WHAT'S DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT  AND MARRYING YOUR CAT BY  DEFINITION?
I CHANGE A LITTER BOX FOR MY  CAT. NOT WHAT I WOULD DO IN A  MARRIAGE.
WHAT IF YOUR LOVED ONE NEEDED  THEIR LITTER BOX CHANGED? WOULD YOU DO IT? I WOULD DO IT. THAT'S THE LEVEL WHICH I LOVE. PEOPLE. WHAT LEVEL DO YOU LOVE PEOPLE.
THIS IS SOMETHING TO THINK  ABOUT.
MOVING ON, YOU TWEETED ON GUN  CONTROL. YOU TWEETED IT'S TIME TO CONTROL  ACCESS TO HANDGUNS. DIDN'T YOU LEAVE OUT A COUPLE OF  "TOS" IN THERE, LIKE OUR RIGHT  TO BEAR ARMS UNDER THE SECOND  AMENDMENT?
I MEAN IT'S NOT AN UNFETTERED  RIGHT.
WHAT'S YOUR PREFERRED METHOD  FROM PRYING IT FROM MY COLD DEAD  HANDS.
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR  GUNS.
REALLY? YOU APPEARED ON THIS WEEK  STEPHANAPOLOUS AND SAID, QUOTE,  WE'VE GOT TO GET THE GUNS.
BUT I THINK THAT... WE'VE GOT TO GET THE GUNS. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE GUNS  THAT ARE ON OUR STREETS.
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE MY GUN. I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR  GUN.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE MY  GUN BECAUSE I HAVE GUNS. ARE YOU DIAGNOSE A GUN REGISTRY  RIGHT NOW.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE  KNOW...
WHO HAS GUNS SO YOU CAN TAKE  MY GUN. LET ME THROW OUT A SCENARIO. THIS IS WHY I NEED A GUN. I'M ASLEEP. I SLEEP IN THE NUDE. I WAKE UP. THERE'S A METH-CRAZED MANIAC  OVER MY BED WEARING NOTHING BUT  A CLOWN MASK. AND A JOCK STRAP. HE'S GOT AN AX IN HIS HAND. I REACH FOR MY GUN AND THEN I  THINK, OH, I REMEMBER,  CONGRESSMAN EDWARDS TOOK MY GUN. MAY I CALL TO FIGHT OFF THAT  GUY? OR DO I JUST REASON WITH HIM OR  DO I OFFER TO GAY MARRY HIM?
I THINK YOU'D BE ABLE TO GET  THE GUN BECAUSE I WILL NOT HAVE  REMOVED IT FROM YOUR HOME.
BUT YOU DO SEE THE PROBLEM? NO. IT'S HARD TO ENVISION THAT  PROBLEM.
YOU AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN  COMMON. WE'RE BOTH DISAPPOINTED WITH  PRESIDENT OBAMA.
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE  PRESIDENT.
HAVE YOU CRITICIZED HIS  POLICY ON DRONE USE.
I HAVE CRITICIZED SOME OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POLICIES.
WHEN HE ASKED FOR EXTRA  TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN, DID YOU  VOTE YES?
NO, I DID NOT. OKAY. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SOCIAL  SECURITY SHOULD BE CUT?
NO. OKAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS PROPOSED  CUTS TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND  MEDICAID. WHAT IS THIS DOING TO YOU?
I SAW THAT AS A PROBLEM. SO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH  PRESIDENT OBAMA.
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CUTTING  SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE.
IMAGINE THAT I'M AN OLD WOMAN  IN YOUR DISTRICT, OKAY. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE OLD  PEOPLE WHO TRUSTED YOU AND  TRUSTED OBAMA?
WELL, I DEFINITELY HAVE A  PROBLEM WITH CUTTING SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICARE.
STOP THAT MAN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE. I NEED THAT MONEY. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP HIM.
WELL, I DON'T AGREE WITH  PRESIDENT OBAMA. I DO THINK THAT...
STOP HIM. WE WANT TO PROTECT YOUR  SOCIAL SECURITY.
THAT BAD MAN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY ALL  MY MONEY.
HE'S NOT A BAD MAN.  WASN'T BORN HERE, YOU  KNOW. HE'S AN ARAB. HE'S AN ARAB. YOU KNOW HE'S A MUSLIM. SEAN HANNITY TOLD ME THAT. YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT  THIS. OH, JENNY. MY GRANDDAUGHTER JENNY WHOM I'VE  NEVER MET. BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER MARRIED A  BLACK MAN.
THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT  ESPECIALLY THE OLDER WOMEN IN MY  DISTRICT LOVE PRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT HE'S  PROPOSED FOR MEDICARE AND SOCIAL  SECURITY.
SO YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE  PRESIDENT ON THAT.
I DON'T. WHEN WILL YOU SAY ENOUGH, I'M  READY TO BE A REPUBLICAN?
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. NO? . YES? NO. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR  TAKING THE TIME TO TALK TO ME  TODAY.
THANK YOU. Stephen: LET'S PUT MARYLAND'S  FOURTH UP ON THE BIG BOARD. IT LOOKEDS LIKE THE INDIANS  FINALLY TORCHED FED-EX FIELD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
