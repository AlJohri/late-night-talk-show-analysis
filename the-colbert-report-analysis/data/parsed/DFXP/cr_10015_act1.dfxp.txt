Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW THREAT TO YOUR MARRIAGE! THE OLD THREAT WAS REPLACED BY A YOUNGER ONE. (LAUGHTER) THEN, HOW IS TECHNOLOGY CHANGING T.V. NEWS? TWEET ME YOUR THOUGHTS WITH HASHTAG "POINTLESS TWEETING." (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST, JACK ANDRAKA, IS A 16-YEAR-OLD WHO INVENTED AN EARLY TEST FOR PANCREATIC CANCER-- BUT YOU ENJOY THAT BUMPER STICKER FOR MAKING HONOR ROLL. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S A GLOBAL WINE SHORTAGE. GREAT, NOW PEOPLE IN BOOK CLUBS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO READ. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN").
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. SIT DOWN, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, I LIKE GIVING YOU GOOD NEWS BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S SAD TO SAY THIS CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IS THE LEAST POPULAR OF ALL TIME. JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON ON CAPITOL HILL MAKES PEOPLE NAUSEOUS. NAUSEA, BY THE WAY, MORE POPULAR THAN CONGRESS. (LAUGHTER) AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE THE MOST-LEAST POPULAR. (LAUGHTER) ONE REASON IS THAT THEY DISAPPOINTED THEIR BASE BY VOTING TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING ON THE FLIMSY EXCUSE OF AVOIDING A GALACTIC ECONOMIC MELTDOWN. WELL, YESTERDAY SENATE REPUBLICANS DID THEIR BEST TO FIX THAT MISTAKE WHEN 27 G.O.P. SENATORS VOTED TO DISAPPROVE OF THEIR PREVIOUS VOTES TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING. (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE THE MOTION WAS TITLED "S.R.-346, FISCAL I CALL BACKSIES." (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THEM TO GET THIS VOTE. MITCH McCONNELL HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH HARRY REID SO THAT THE RECENT DEBT CEILING BILL INCLUDED A PROVISION THAT THERE WOULD BE A SECOND VOTE EXPRESSING APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF THE FIRST VOTE. (LAUGHTER) IN SHORT, G.O.P. SENATORS VOTED FOR RAISING THE DEBT CEILING ON THE STIPULATION THEY COULD VOTE AGAINST HAVING VOTED FOR IT. PROVING THAT REPUBLICANS MAY NOT BE BIPARTISAN BUT THEY MAY BE BIPOLAR. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THESE BRAVE 27 STATESMEN LED BY MITCH McCONNELL TOOK THIS STAND FOR THE NOBLEST OF REASONS-- TO GET REELECTED. I FOR ONE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE CAMPAIGN ADS-- SO I DIDN'T. JIM?
MITCH McCONNELL CLAIMS TO BE A SMALL-GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE BUT HE VOTED WITH THE DEMOCRATS TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING. BUT MITCH McCONNELL KNOWS THAT WAS WRONG. HE TOOK A STAND AGAINST MITCH McCONNELL. (LAUGHTER) MITCH McCONNELL, WRONG FOR KENTUCKY. VOTE CHANGE. VOTE MITCH McCONNELL. (LAUGHTER) I'M MITCH McCONNELL AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. NO I DON'T! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, WITH AN AD LIKE THAT ONE ONE OF THEM CAN'T LOSE. (LAUGHTER) NATION, YOU WATCH THE SHOW, YOU KNOW MY MIDDLE NAME IS "DANGER." BUT MY FIRST NAME IS "WE'RE ALL IN" AND MY LAST NAME IS "RUN FOR YOUR LIVES." THIS IS THE THREATDOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS UNDER ATTACK AND THIS TIME IT'S NOT JUST FROM THE GAYS-- ALTHOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY, THEY'RE NOT HELPING. LOOK AT NEIL PATRICK HARRIS' FAMILY HALLOWEEN PHOTO. (AUDIENCE REACTS) "COME TO MY HOUSE, I HAVE FUN-SIZED SNICKERS." (LAUGHTER) NO, THE REAL THREAT TO MARRIAGE IS THREAT NUMBER THREE: DIVORCE. DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, DID YOU? NOW, DIVORCE HAS NEVER BEEN GREAT FOR A MARRIAGE, BUT ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, DIVORCE IS CONTAGIOUS. WHICH I'VE SUSPECTED FOR A LONG TIME. THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS DID "LARRY KING LIVE" IN A HAZMAT SUIT WHILE HOLDING A CANARY. (LAUGHTER) I WAS OKAY. (APPLAUSE) I WAS OKAY BUT LARRY DID HIT ON THE CANARY. (LAUGHTER) NO MEANS NO, LARRY. NOW, ACCORDING TO A THREE-DECADE STUDY BY BROWN UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS-- ALTHOUGH REALLY IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS WHAT COLOR THEY WERE-- COUPLES WERE 75% MORE LIKELY TO BECOME DIVORCED IF A FRIEND IS DIVORCED AND 33% MORE LIKELY TO DIVORCE IF A FRIEND OF A FRIEND ENDS HIS OR HER MARRIAGE. AND I'M NOT SURPRISED. I HAVE NEVER TRUSTED FRIENDS OF A FRIEND. I MEAN, I'M MY FRIEND'S FRIEND. WHO ARE THESE OTHER PEOPLE? (LAUGHTER) RESEARCHERS SAY DIVORCE CAN SPREAD LIKE AN EPIDEMIC THROUGH A SOCIAL NETWORK LIKE A RUMOR AFFECTING FRIENDS UP TO TWO DEGREES REMOVED! THAT'S RIGHT! DIVORCE CAN SPREAD LIKE CRABS AT THEATER CAMP! WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ALWAYS SAID DIVORCE SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. ONCE A COUPLE STARTS HANGING OUT WITH NANCY WHO'S GOT A NEW LEASE OF LIFE, LOOKS AMAZING AND IS SPENDING THANKSGIVING IN TURKS AND CAICOS HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE SATISFIED WITH YOUR SPOUSE WHO IS SPENDING THANKSGIVING WITH YOU? (LAUGHTER) SO, FOLKS, PROTECT YOURSELF. STAY OUT OF PLACES WHERE THOSE INFECTED WITH DIVORCE OFF CONGREGATE: THE FROZEN FOOD AISLE, DOG RUNS, MIATA DEALERSHIPS, OR TRAVELING THROUGH THAILAND BECAUSE (BLEEP) IT. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NEXT UP, FOLKS, THE DEBATE ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION IS BACK IN CONGRESS BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IT MAY BE TOO LATE TO STOP THE SALSA TSUNAMI. BECAUSE I SAW THIS ON "GOOD MORNING AMERICA" MONDAY MORNING, AMERICA, AND IT WAS NOT GOOD. JIM?
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, G.M.A. AND THE NUMBER-ONE LATINO MORNING SHOW JOINING FORCES FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED LIVE TELEVISION EVENT! WE'RE SWAPPING WITH UNIVISION'S "DESPIERTA AMERICA".
Stephen: WOW, I HAD NO IDEA G.M.A. WAS THAT DESPIERTA FOR VIEWERS. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS BRINGS US TO THREAT NUMBER TWO-- UNDOCUMENTED NETWORK JUMPERS. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, IS NOTHING SACRED? THEY GAVE THE G.M.A. LOGO ONE OF THOSE MEXCLAMATION POINTS. KWRAO +EPL NAY SO G.M.A. SO MUCH THAT I ONCE COHOSTED IT. IT WAS THE HAPPIEST TIME OF MY LIFE. (LAUGHTER) AND ASSOCIATE IT HAD JOY WE ALL FEEL WATCHING THE GANG WITH SPANISH SPEAKING IS A THREAT TO MY LATINO RAGE. FOR YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO STEREOTYPE THE RISING TIDE OF RICE AND BEANS AS PARASITIC BARBARIANS COMING TO TAKE OUR JOBS. BUT NOW THE SO-CALLED AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANY HAS CHALLENGED MY PREJUDICES WITH SENSITIVE PORTRAYALS OF THE RICH CENTURIES OLD HISPANIC CULTURE.
NOW YOU HAVE TO SAY BUENOS DIAS, AMERICA!
BUENOS DIAS FROM BEAUTIFUL MIAMI!
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
OH! OOH! NO, NO!
ENRIQUE IGLESIAS!
HE'S A LITTLE BIT DIVA NOW. I THINK YOU'RE PAMPERING HER.
YOU TAUGHT ME SOME WORDS. WE'LL DO A SPANGLISH KIND OF THING WHERE YOU CAN TEACH ME WORDS.
THE IDEA IS YOU LEARN SOME WORDS IN SPANISH.
TELENOVELLA.
ESPANO.
TORTILLA!
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE. (APPLAUSE) IT'S LIKE THEY'RE READING YOU "100 YEARS OF SOLITUDE" BY GABRIEL GARCIA GORDITA! FINALLY, FOLKS, I LOVE MY MICKEY Ds. I GET A McMUFFIN, TWO McGRIDDLES AND TO WATCH IT DOWN A McALLEN. â™ª I GOT PROBLEM  AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE I LOVE THAN McDONALD'S DOLLAR MENU. WITH JUST THE CHANGE I FIND BETWEEN MY COUCH CUSHIONS I CAN EAT SOMETHING WITH THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF A COUCH CUSHION. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY THIS McNUGGET OF McNEWS SUPERSIZED MY ANGER AND MADE ME GRIMACE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FILLET O'FISH. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
AMERICA'S FAVORITE FAST FOOD JOINT SAYS GOOD-BYE TO ITS DOLLAR MENU. McDONALD'S DOLLAR MENU IS GETTING A NEW NAME. DOLLAR MENU AND MORE. IT WILL INCLUDE EVERYTHING ON THE CURRENT DOLLAR MENU ALONG WITH PRICIER ITEMS LIKE A 20-PIECE McNUT GETS FOR $5.
Stephen: YES, THE DOLLAR MENU AND MORE. OR WHAT OTHER RESTAURANTS CALL "THE MENU." (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S ALL DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. LOOKY WHY. RISING TEMPERATURES HAVE LED TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN CATTLE RANCHING STATES FORCING RANCHERS TO CULL HERDS AND PAY MORE FOR FEED LEADING TO MORE EXPENSIVE CATTLE ON THE MARKET. WELL, IF CATTLE FEED HAS BECOME SO EXPENSIVE WHY DON'T THEY JUST FEED COWS STUFF OFF THE DOLLAR MENU? (LAUGHTER) DO I HAVE TO THINK OF EVERYTHING? ANYWAY, FOLKS, THIS WHOLE CRISIS BRINGS KNOW THE NUMBER ONE THREAT IN AMERICA -- GLOBAL WARMING. FOLKS, MELTING ICECAPS AND FLORIDA GETTING SWALLOWED UP BY RISING SEAS IS ONE THING. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHEN WITHIN MY McDOUBLE GOES FROM $1 TO $1.12, THIS (BLEEP) JUST GOT REAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I AM CALLING -- I AM CALLING ON YOU TO GO TO YOUR LOCAL McDONALD'S AND DEMAND THAT THEY SAVE THE DOLLAR MENU BEFORE IT GOES THE WAY OF THE DODO. I CAN BARELY REMEMBER WHAT THOSE THINGS TASTED LIKE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
