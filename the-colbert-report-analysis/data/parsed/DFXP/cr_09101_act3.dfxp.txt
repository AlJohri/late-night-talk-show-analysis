Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT HAVE WRITTEN A  BOOK ABOUT BEING RESCUED FROM  SOMALI PIRATES. I'M GOING TO ASK WHAT IT'S LIKE  TO MEET JOHNNY DEPP. PLEASE WELCOME JESSICA BUCHANAN  AND ERIC LANDEMALM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. Stephen: NOW, YOU HAVE A NEW  BOOK CALLED "IMPOSSIBLE ODDS"  THE KIDNAPPING OF JESSICA BUCHANAN AND HER DRAMATIC RESCUE  BY SEAL TEAM SIX. SET THE TABLE FOR US HERE. WHERE WERE YOU AND WHY?
WELL, I WAS IN SOMALIA. Stephen: WHY? THAT IS NOT USUALLY A VACATION  DESTINATION.
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY BEAUTIFUL. Stephen: IS IT REALLY? IT IS ACTUALLY. Stephen: BUT PEOPLE GET  KIDNAPPEDDED THERE.
WELL, THEY'RE STARTING TO,  YES. ANYWAY, SO ERIC AND I, WE ARE  HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS. I'M A TEACHER BY PROFESSION. HE'S A HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER. WE WERE THERE DOING HUMANITARIAN  AID WORK.
Stephen: AND HOW LONG HAD YOU  BEEN THERE BEFORE YOU WERE  KIDNAPPED?
WELL, WE WERE LIVING IN THE  NORTHERN PART OF SOMALIA WHICH  IS SAFER. DEFINITELY. SO I HAD TRAVELED DOWN INTO  SOUTHERN SOMALIA FOR MY  ORGANIZATION TO DO SOME TRAINING AND THINGS FOR MY STAFF. IN THE PLACE WHERE I WAS  KIDNAPPED I WAS ONLY ABOUT A  DAY.
Stephen: YOU HAD JUST GOTTEN  THERE. WHEN DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE  BEING KIDNAPPED�i BY PIRATES?
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS BEING  KIDNAPPED BY PIRATES FOR A  WHILE.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU ACTUALLY WERE KIDNAPPED  BEFORE YOU WERE REALIZED YOU  WERE BEING KIDNAPPED?
I REALIZED THAT I WAS BEING  KIDNAPPED. THAT WAS ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS AL SHABAB  OR PIRATES. I DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE  GANGSTERS OR WHO IT WAS.
Stephen: WAS THIS ON A BOAT? THIS WAS NOT ON A BOAT. Stephen: SO THESE WERE�r LAND  PIRATES, THE RARE LAND PIRATE. WERE YOU WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS  KIDNAPPED?
NO, NO, I�i WAS ABOUT FOUR  HOURS'�i�i DRIVE, DRIVING NORTH y5�  WHERE JESSICA SET THE TIME.
Stephen: I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH 'pABOUT THIS STORY BACK  UNITED STATES. WAS THERE MUCH REPORTING AND I  JUST MISSED IT?
NO, NO, WE TRIED TO KEEP IT  AS DARK AS�i POSSIBLE.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T WANT  REPORTING ON IT.
NOTHING.�i�r  Stephen: WHY? HONESTLY, WE WANTED TOAOrpkE�i  CONTROL OVER THE�r SITUATION�i. ONCE IT REACHES GOOD PEOPLE�i LIKE  YOURSELF, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT  WILL HAPPEN.
Stephen: YOU SPECIFICALLY  KEPT ME FROM FINDING OUT ABOUT  IT.��
RIGHT. HAVE FLOWN OVER THERE MYSELF AND  KICKED A LITTLE ASS. OKAY. HOW LONG WERE YOU?��
93 DAYS. Stephen: WHAT WERE THE  CONDITIONS YOU WERE LIVING  UNDER.
TERRIBLE. MINE IT WAS LIKE THE MOST  EXTREME CAMPING EXPERIENCE YOU  COULD EVER HAVE. I MEAN I'M A HUMANITARIAN AID  WORKER BUT I'M NOT MUCH OF A  CAMPERMENT IT WAS SLEEPING ON THE GROUND UNDER TREES OUT AT  NIGHT EATING TUNA FISH OUT OF A  CAN WITH A�i TAMP ONAPPLICATOR AS A UTENSIL.�i  BEING SURROUNDED BY�i 26 MEN 24  HOURS A DAY FOR 93�r DAYS.
Stephen: WHAT WERE THEY  ASKING FOR?
THEY STARTED THE RANSOM AT  $45 MILLION. THE REASONING BEHIND THAT WAS,  YOU KNOW, THE SOMALI CULTURE  WORKS IN A WAY THAT THEY ALL COME TOGETHER AND CONTRIBUTE. SO IT'S A CLAN SYSTEM. THEY FIGURE AMERICA WORKS THAT  WAY TOO. HOW MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE  IN AMERICA? ALL THEY HAD HAD TO DO WAS PITCH  IN A DOLLAR AND THEN BOOM.
Stephen: THEY THOUGHT WE'D  PASS A HAT AROUND IN AMERICA AND�i  SEND THEM $45 MILLION?
YES. Stephen: DID YOU END UP  RAISING ANY MONEY?
NO. Stephen: DID YOU TELL THEM  WE'RE RAISING THE MONEY.
OF COURSE. Stephen: WE'RE LIKE AT 30  MILL RIGHT NOW.
DOWN TO 18 MILLION. Stephen: YOU EVALUATED. EVENTUALLY IT WENT DOWN  FURTHER.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER MAKE  ANY SORT OF CONNECTION WITH  THEM? PEOPLE TALK ABOUT STOCKHOLM  SYNDROME. I KNOW YOU'RE FROM SWEDEN SO YOU  MUST HAVE IT ALL THE TIME. DID YOU HAVE IT AT ALL? DID YOU SYMPATHIZE WITH THEM AT  ALL?
I'M AN AID WORKER SO THERE IS  A LEVEL OF SYMPATHIZER WITH  THEM. I MEAN THAT'S WHY I WAS THERE IN  THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE I WANTED  TO HELP THE SOMALI PEOPLE. HOWEVER, I DIDN'T WANT TO SIT  THERE AND LIVE WITH THEM IN THE  DESERT FOR ENDLESS PERIODS OF  TIME.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE RESCUE  LIKE?
IT WAS CRAZY. Stephen: WHAT DID YOU THINK  WAS HAPPENING?
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING  REKIDNAPPED BY ANOTHER GROUP.
Stephen: DOES THAT HAPPEN A  LOT?
THAT HAPPENS. Stephen: YOU'RE A COMMODITY. NOT ONLY WERE THEY TRYING TO  KEEP FROM BEING ATTACKED BY THE  AMERICAN MILITARY OR OTHER MILITARY THEY WERE TRYING TO  KEEP US�"AS HOSTAGES AWAY FROM�r  I THOUGHT WE WERE BEING�� KIDNAPPED BY�r AN EXTREME GROUP   . LINKED TO AL.P � I'M LAYING THERE. THERE'S GUN FIRE GOING ON. I'M HEARING PEOPLE DIE AROUND  ME.�4@6CJ%  IT'S LIKE�� THE MOST... IT'S LIKE  A HOLLYWOOD�i MOVIE. AND I'M THINKING, OKAY, EITHER  I'M GOING TO GET SHOT IN THE  HEAD AND THIS IS REALLY OVER OR I'M GOING TO GET REKIDNAPPED. I'M NEVER GOING TO SURVIVE THIS.
NOT UNTIL THEY GRABBED ME AND  THEY SAID MY NAME. THEY SAID JESSICA. WE'RE THE AMERICAN MILITARY. WE'RE HERE TO SAVE YOU. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME. YOU'RE SAFE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: AND THEN IN THE  HELICOPTER... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). DO YOU STILL LIVE OVERSEAS? ARE YOU STILL IN A DANGEROUS  AREA?
NO. Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU NOW? WE LIVE OUTSIDE OFMY WASHINGTON��  D.C.
Stephen: YOU STILL LIVE NEAR  RUTHLESS THIEVES.     IVING IN A PLACE
BUT WE4kQ  WHERE THE AUTHORITIES ACTUALLY  DO SOMETHING. SO WE FEEL OKAY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A KID NOW.��  WE DO.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU. THAT WAS A GOOD�i QUESTION.�i  IS HAVING A NEWBORN SOMETIME  LIKE BEING KIDNAPPED BY PIRATES? AT LEAST YOU HAVE SOME SLEEP  BACK THEN.
NOT EXACTLY. I HAVE TO SAY HE'S A LOT CUTER  THAN THE PIE�� RAS.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK YOU'LL  EVER DO BACK AND DO THIS KIND OF�r  WORK�� AGAIN.
YEAH. , WE KIND�i OF... NOT IN SOMALIA. Stephen: YOU KNOW, THERE ARE  SOME POOR PEOPLE IN BRITISH  VIRGIN ISLANDS AS WELL. IN THE CARIBBEAN. THANK YNW SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ERIC, JESSICA. THE BOOK IS IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
