(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, NATION! THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND SKBRE --
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOUR LOVE IS LIKE THE RISING SUN AND I'M A LITTLE ROSEBUD OPENING BEFORE YOU. FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, THE UNITED STATES IS THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN. THAT'S WHY WE EAT SO MANY DOUGHNUTS IT. BUT APPARENTLY YOU CANNOT POLICE SIX BILLION PEOPLE THESE DAYS WITHOUT GETTING A FEW COMPLAINTS.
THE U.S. GETTING BLASTED TODAY. ALL BECAUSE OF DRONES.
TWO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN-RIGHTS GROUPS SAY THAT THEY HAVE NEW EVIDENCE THAT U.S. DRONE STRIKES HAVE KILLED DOZENS OF CIVILIANS IN PAKISTAN AND YEMIN.
U.S. DRONE STRIKES COULD AMOUNT TO WAR CRIMES.
Stephen: WAR CRIMES IF? NO. (LAUGHTER) TECHNICALLY WE HAVEN'T DECLARED WAR ON THOSE COUNTRIES. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE JUST CRIMES. BESIDES, I THINK WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THESE DRONE ATTACKS ARE DONE WITH SURGICAL PRECISION. BECAUSE THE BEST WAY FOR A SURGEON TO REMOVE YOUR APPENDIX IS BY HELL FIRE MISSILE. (LAUGHTER) WE MAY HAVE VAPORIZED YOUR LIVER, KIDNEY AND SPLEEN BUT YOUR APPENDIX IS ON THE RUN. PLUS BARACK OBAMA ASSURED WHEN ORDERING A STRIKE THERE MUST BE NEAR CERTAINTY THAT NO CIVILIANS WILL BE KILLED OR INJURED. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF ALMOST SURE THING I'M WILLING TO BET SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE ON. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT FOR THE LOCAL PAKISTANI ECONOMY BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT PRESENCE OF CIRCLING DRONES, SALES OF SLEEPING TABLETS, ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AND MEDICINE TO TREAT ANXIETY HAVE SOARED AS WELL AS PILLS FOR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION. (LAUGHTER) YES, THERE'S A REASON THAT CIALIS COUP SELL SITTING OUTSIDE IN BATHTUBS, BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT AFTER THE DRONE BLEW UP THEIR HOUSE. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS, AS UNIVERSALLY EFFECTIVE AS OUR DRONE PROGRAM IS, THERE IS ONE PLACE ON EARTH THEY SHOULD NEVER BE USED, JIM?
DRONES, AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE WEAPON AGAINST AL QAEDA MUCH BUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN BIG BROTHER BRINGS THEM HOME.
A NEW GENERATION OF SURVEILLANCE DRONE KOS SOON BE WATCHING US ALL FROM OVERHEAD.
THAT COULD BE AS MANY AS 30,000 OF THESE KIND OF DRONES. THEY WILL, IN EFFECT, BRING EVERY SINGLE BACKYARD IN AMERICA INTO THE AUTHORITIES VIEW.
BACKYARDS LIKE YOURS. BUT IN QUIET DEER TRAIL, COLORADO, ONE COURAGEOUS PATRIOT NAMED PHIL STEEL IS FIGHTING BACK.
WHAT I'M PROTESTING ARE THE PRINCIPLESES OF FREEDOM ON WHICH THIS NATION IS FOUNDED. WHO I AM PROTECTING IS EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN.
AND HOW WILL HE PROTECT US THESE FLYING DEATHS.
PHILIP STEEL IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER.
DEER TRAIL IS KNOWN FOR MANY THINGS.
DEER TRAIL, COLORADO, IS KNOWN FOR ITS HOME OF THE FIRST RODEO.
IT HAD A RODEO, THE FIRST RODEO.
THIS TOWN IS KNOWN AS THE WORLD'S FIRST RODEO.
OKAY, JUST ONE THING. BUT NOW IT'S KNOWN FOR PHIL STEEL, A MAN FAMOUS FOR SHOOTING FOR THE STARS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST THINK HE'S --
I'M SORRY, A WHAT.
IF EVERYTHING IS GOING GOOD SOMEBODY THROWS A TURD IN THE POT TO GET PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT.
AND DEER TRAIL'S LATEST TALK OF THE TURD IS AN ORDINANCE THAT PHIL SUBMITTED TO THE TOWN COUNCIL.
I WROTE AN ORDINANCE TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE SOVEREIGN AIRSPACE OF THE TOWN OF DEER TRAIL, COLORADO FROM DRONES.
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
WE'RE GOING TO ISSUE DRONE HUNTING LICENSES AND SHOOT DOWN DRONES. WE'RE GOING TO-- THE TOWN IS GOING TO PAY BOUNTY JUST LIKE SOME COMMUNITIES IN WYOMING WILL PAY BOUNTIES FOR COYOTES, WE WILL PAY BOUNTIES FOR DRONE PARTS.
A BOLD PLAN SUPPORTED BY THIS MAN, MAYOR FRANK FIELDS. MAYOR FIELDS KNOWS THAT THIS ORDINANCE IS ABOUT PRESERVING LIBERTY.
HIS ORDINANCE IS ABOUT MAKING SOME MONEY FOR THE TOWN.
NO, IT'S NOT THE MONIES THAT'S FOR ME IT'S ABOUT THE MESSAGE.
A MESSAGE FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION.
MY MESSAGE TO OBAMA IS GO BACK TO KENYA.
OKAY. LOUD AND CLEAR. ANYTHING ELSE? OKAY. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DRONES.
NO, NO.
ALL RIGHTY. BUT SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE. THIS IS-- MISSY A FORMER UNITED STATES FIGHTER PILOT TURNED MIT PROFESSOR OF AERONAUGHT YOU CAN AND DRONE.
I DON'T ADVOCATE SHOOTING DOWN DRONES BECAUSE THE GOOD OF DRONES OUTWEIGHS ANY BAD.
GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE.
DELIVERING MEDICATION AND CRITICAL SUPPLIES PEOPLE IN SMALL TOWNS, BRIDGE INSPECTIONS, INFRASTRUCTURE INSPECTIONS, CROP HEALTH MONITORING, CROP DUSTING, THESE ARE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT FOR HUMANS TO DO.
OKAY. BUT TELL HER WHAT THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO DO WITH THE DRONES, PHIL.
DRONES COULD BE USED TO ENFORCE ANY LAW.
ANY LAW.
YES, INCLUDING OBAMACARE.
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY POSSIBLE WAY THAT WE COULD TIE IN DRONES TO OBAMACARE.
TELL HER, PHIL.
MANY REASONS TO CONDUCT SURVEILLANCE. LET'S TAKE SMOKERS. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SMOKE BREAKS, OKAY, FLY A DRONE, OH, DO YOU CHECK NONSMOKER ON YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE FORM? OH, I'M SORRY, WE'RE GOING HAVE TO PENALIZE YOU NOW.
LIKE TO SMOKE, WELL HERE'S YOUR FIRE. BUT EVEN WITH THE THREAT OF DRONES CLEAR, RESIDENTS ARE DIVIDED ON DRONE HUNTING.
PART OF IT IS YES AND THE OTHER PART NO.
I DOUBT I WOULD GO DRONE HUNTING.
I THINK IT'S STUPID. ABOUT AS STUPID AS YOU WOULD GET, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
FOR HIS DREAM TO BECOME A REALITY PHIL STEEL WOULD HAVE TO SELL IT TO THE TOWN COUNCIL. IT'S ON THE DAY OF THE VOTE. HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A LASTING IMPRESSION AS SEEN HERE IN THIS ACTUAL TOWN COUNCIL FOOTAGE.
THE MAYOR LOOKED UP AND HE SAID I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS HERE. AND THEN THE THEME SONG FROM THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY BEGAN PLAYING.
CAME RIDING IN WEARING A COWBOY HAT, OIL CLOTH DUSTER CARRYING A ENOUGH GUN, I BEGAN MY PRESENTATION.
THEY HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE DUMBFOUNDED.
DUMB FOUNDED WITH PRIDE. THE TOWN COUNCIL VOTED AND IT WAS A LANDSLIDE TIE.
SINCE IT WAS A TIE VOTE IT HAS TO GO TO THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.
SO NOW IT'S UP TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE PHIL OF THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.
THIS WILL NOT GO AWAY. SOME PEOPLE JUST MEETING BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD JUST END THIS BY NOT SUPPORTING IT AND VOTING AGAINST IT BUT THEY DIDN'T END IT.
NOPE, IT AIN'T OVER BECAUSE PHIL STEEL HAS SOMETHING NOT EVERYONE HAS.
I THINK HE HAS A PROBLEM.
NOPE, HE HAS A PRINTER.
NEW TONIGHT A DRONE HUNTING LICENCE, OVER 25 BUCKS.
TAKE A LOOK, THIS IS THE CERTIFICATE THAT IS CALLED A LICENCE TO HUNT AND KILL DRONES.
THIS IS CREATED BY A MAN NAMED PHIL STEEL.
THE COUNCIL MAY NOT HAVE APPROVED DRONE HUNTING LICENSES BUT PHIL STEEL CAN STILL SELL THEM.
THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT.
AND HE HAS ALREADY SOLD OVER $100 AT $25 A PIECE.
THEY COULD BE SOLD ANYWHERE AND THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR FRAMING.
SO WHILE RESIDENTS MAY NOT AGREE ON DRONE HUNTING, THEY CAN AGREE THAT PHIL STEEL IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE.
I THINK PHIL'S DEFINITELY MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THIS TOWN. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD.
I GUESS HE IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT HAS BEEN ALL GOOD.
HE'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD ON HIS PART. BUT HE WOKE A LOT OF PEOPLE UP.
I WOKE MYSELF UP. I WROTE THIS ORDINANCE BELIEVING THAT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN DO TO CHANGE SO MUCH MORE POER WITHFUL. AND WHAT A LESSON I HAVE LEARNED. I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
IN MY OPINION HE'S DIFFERENT BUT-- HE'S STILL HUMAN BUT HE'S DIFFERENT.
DIFFERENCE MADE.
GOOD LUCK, PHIL, W
