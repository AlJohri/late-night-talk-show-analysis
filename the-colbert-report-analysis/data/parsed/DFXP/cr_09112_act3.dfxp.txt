ACTUALLY, YOU MIGHT.
Stephen:  YOU MIGHT,  REALLY?
ONE OF THE THINGS STEVE AND I  DISCUSSED WHEN WE FIRST STARTED  IS THAT THE SONGS ARE NOT MEANT TO MOVE THE STORY FORWARD. YOU KNOW, LIKE "JESUS CHRIST  SUPERSTAR."  AND WE DIDN'T WANT ANY  DANCING,UN. NO DANGS IN THE SHOW.
Stephen:  OKAY. NO STORY, NO DANCING. GO ON. YOU'VE GOT ME.
THERE'S A LITTLE DANCING. A LITTLE SHOW.
Stephen:  LET'S TALK ABOUT  SOME OF THE PEOPLE YOU GOT HERE. YOU CAN NEKO CASE, ELVIS  COSTELLO. YOU'VE GOT KRIS KRISTOFFERSON,  SHERYL CROW. YOU'VE GOT-- WHO DOES ELVIS  PLAY?
THE DEVIL.
Stephen:  HE PLAYS THE  DEVIL. WHY? BECAUSE HE HAS AN ENGLISH  ACCENT? IS THAT WHY? HE'S A COMPLETELY BELIEVABLE  DEVIL.
HE KNOWS HOW TO GO FOR THAT.
Stephen:  DISPU HAVE SPOKEN  DIALOGUE. SOME OF THE DIALOGUE IS SPOANG  BY MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY.

TOTALLY NUDE.
Stephen:  PLAYING THE  BONGOZE.
MANDATORY.
Stephen:  I HAVE A BONE TO  PICK WITH YOUR PROCESS. WHY COLLABORATE? BECAUSE WHEN YOU COLLABORATE YOU  HAVE TO SHARE CREDIT. ( LAUGHTER )  I DON'T COLLABORATE HERE. I JUST EYE DO EVERYTHING ON THE  SHOW. I JUST-- I ELABORATE.
YOU THINK YOU'RE BEING FUNNY  --
Stephen:  I DON'T.
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER  IS THAT I DON'T COLLABORATE  WELL. I DON'T PLAY WELL WITH THE OTHER  KIDS.
Stephen:  I WAS WONDERING  WHY YOU HAVE A BLACK EYE. ( LAUGHTER )
STEVE DOESN'T-- HE SITS IN A  ROOM AND TYPES. AND THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS ANY  SOCIAL SKILLS AT ALL IS T BONE.
Stephen:  YEAH. AND HE NEVER TAKES HIS SUN GLASS  OFF. WELL, JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. STEPHEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. T BONE, PLEASURE TO HAVE MET  YOU. THANKS FOR COMING.
