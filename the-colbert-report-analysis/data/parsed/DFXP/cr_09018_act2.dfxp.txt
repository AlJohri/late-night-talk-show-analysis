Stephen: YOU DON'T.
OR WATER.
Stephen: YOU GUYS ARE  DOWNTOWN.
YEAH.
Stephen: I BET ALL THOSE  SELLOUTS IN THE UPPER EAST  SIDE DON'T SEEM SO STUPID DO  THEY. YOUR ARTISTIC TIES ARE  PAYING FOR YOUR ART RIGHT  NOW.
WE WENT TO BROOKLYN TO  TAKE SHOWERS.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: I HAVE A SHOWER  IN MY OFFICE IF YOU WANT  TO --
ANNIE.
Stephen: GO UP THERE.
CAN I BORROW IT.
Stephen: WHY DON'T ALL  THREE OF US, YOU KNOW-- WE  ARE ALL SHOW BUSINESS TYPES,  RIGHT? WE'LL SET UP A WEB CAM AND  RAISE MONEY FOR VICTIMS. A THOUGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
MAYBE NOT.
Stephen: NOW DAVID YOU'RE  A ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF  FAMER OVER THERE.
I BELIEVE SO.
Stephen: OKAY. NOW ANNIE KERX I CALL YOU  ANNIE.
PLEASE.
Stephen: OKAY, YOU  PERFORM UNDER ST. VINCENT,  WHY ST. VINCENT, NOT ANNIE.
WELL, I TOOK MY MONDAYIC  FRERE A SONG WHICH  REFERENCES THE HOSPITAL  WHERE DYLAN THOMAS DIED.
Stephen: OH, OKAY.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO IT IS AN  UPBEAT CHOICE.
YEAH.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. SO NOW HE IS INTIMIDATING TO  WORK WITH, THIS GUY SAY  LEGEND. BY THE TIME YOU WERE BORN HE  HAD FOUR ALL BURJS ALREADY  WORKING WITH BRIAN ENO, AND  YOU WERE JUST FINISHED GUESS  TATING. DOES HE EVER, LIKE, PLAY  LIKE THE I'M A LEGEND CARD  ON YOU.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD HIM  SAY I'M A LEGEND.
Stephen: HE NEVER SAYS  LIKE, WELL, BACK IN CBGBs WE  USED TO OR BACK WHEN THERE  WAS A MUSIC INDUSTRY WE USED TO-- NOW WHY ARE YOU, YOU'RE  A LEGEND, NO OFFENSE, WHY  ARE YOU BRINGING HER ALONG? YOU DON'T NEED HER? NO OFFENSE, AGAIN, YOU DON'T  NEED THAT ARE YOU DAVID  GODDAMN BYRNE WHY ARE YOU  DOING THIS?
DO YOU THINK IS A BAD  IDEA THEN?
Stephen: WELL, I DON'T  KNOW. THE MUSIC SOUNDS FANTASTIC,  DON'T GET ME WRONG IT IS A  FANTASTIC SOUND. YOU HAVE A BRASS BAND IN  THERE.
WE DO HAVE BRASS BANDS,  THEY ARE GREAT. WE LIKE THEM.
Stephen: THAT OLD CHOICE,  FROM 2012.
THE PLACE WE THOUGHT WE  WERE GOING TO PLAY, WHERE WE  WERE GOING TO ODDICIAN SOME  OF THESE SONGS DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A PA, A SOUND SYSTEM  SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS  ACTUALLY ANNIE'S IDEA SAID  WELL, IF WE HAVE A BRASS GROUP, I THOUGHT YEAH, THEN  WE WOULDN'T NEED A SOUND  SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE  LOUD ENOUGH BY THEMSELVES.
Stephen: THAT IS PERFECT  FOR NEW YORK RIGHT NOW  BECAUSE FOR HALF THE CITY  THERE IS NO SOUND SYSTEM. HOW DID YOU CREATE THIS  ALBUM TOGETHER? DID YOU GUYS GET TOGETHER  AND JUST THRASH OUT SONGS IN  A GARAGE OR SOMETHING?
NO, WE DIDN'T. WE WORKED ON FILES AND SONGS  INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN SENT  THEM TO EACH OTHER OVER  E-MAIL.
WE DID GET TOGETHER. WE WENT TO SEE MOVIES IN  THEATRE AND HAVE DINNER  TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SO YOU DATED IN  YOUR FREE TIME AND SAID THIS  IS NICE, LET'S SEE HOW THIS  WORKS AS A COULD LAB RAISE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY E-MAIL? WHY SUCH AN ARCHAIC  TECHNOLOGY AS E-MAIL. YOU KNOW THE KIDS ALL TEXT  NOW. THEY DON'T E-MAIL.
I KNOW, OR TWITTER. WE COULD HAVE MADE THE  RECORD BY TWEETS.
Stephen: YEAH, EACH ONE  WOULD BE LIKE VERY HAIKU  LIKE.
SHORT SONGS.
Stephen: BUT HOW LONG  BEFORE YOU GOT TOGETHER TO  DOT MUSIC TOGETHER IF YOU  COLLABORATED VIA E-MAIL?
WE ARE WERE BOTH LIKE WE  WOULD HAVE TOURS, WE WOULD  HAVE OTHER RECORDS THAT WE  WERE DOING IN THE MEANTIME. WE WERE IN NO HURRY TO DO  THIS. SO IN BETWEEN WE WOULD GET  TOGETHER FOR LIKE THREE OR  FOUR DAYS AND RECORD A BUNCH  OF SONGS LIKE FOUR SONGS, AND THEN GO OKAY, THAT WAS  GOO. -- GOOD.
Stephen: ANNIE, ARE YOU  AN ARTIST.
SOMETIMES, YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH, ARE YOU  ONE OF THOSE I ASKED DAVID  LAST TIME HE WAS HERE, ARE  YOU ONE OF THOSE ARTISTS WHO HAS TROUBLE WITH THE IDEA  THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BE  ODE? NO, NO I DON'T MEAN THAT AS  A BAD THING. I MEAN THAT MOST OF HUMANITY,  AND I ASKED NEW LAST TIME,  HUMANITY IS WHAT WE THINK OF  AS COMMON OR ODE. I THINK SOMETIMES ARTISTS  ARE TRAPPED BY THEIR NEED TO  BE EXTRAORDINARY. AND THEY DISTANCE THEMSELVES  SOMETIMES FROM PEOPLE. DOW EVER FEAR THAT BY BEING  AN ARTIST, BEING  EXTRAORDINARY YOU MISS OUT  ON SOME OF HUMAN'S ODE  EXISTENCE?
I FEEL PRETTY ODE.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU  DON'T HAVE POWER OR A SHOWER? DAVID, YOU HAVE THOUGHT  ABOUT MY QUESTION ANY MORE  SINCE THE LAST TIME WE  TALKED? ARE YOU EXTRAORDINARY OR DOW  FEEL A NEED TO BE  EXTRAORDINARY OR ARE YOU ODE  PERSON.
I MAKE A GREAT EFFORT TO  BE ODE.
Stephen: HOW IS THAT  WORKING? (LAUGHTER)  WELL I TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S  DO SOME EXTRAORDINARY MUSIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANNIE. DAVID. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A  PERFORMANCE BY DAVID LIRN  AND ST. VINCENT
