Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A BASKETBALL HALL OF FAMEIR WHO HELPED MODERNIZE-- I'M GOING TO TAKE TO HIM ALL THE WAY FROM MIDTOWN. PLEASE WELCOME JULIUS DR. J. ERVING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DOCTOR GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HI, HOW ARE YOU.
Stephen:  NICE TO YOU HAVE ON.
FINALLY, FINALLY.
Stephen:  IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF GREATNESS.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  HOW DID YOU GET THE TERM "DR. J." DID YOU AROUND THAT. IS THAT AN HONORARY DEGREE.
I HAVE SEVERAL HONORARY DEGREES BUT I WAS CALLED DOCTOR LONG BEFORE I GOT HONORARY DEGREES, MAYBE BACK AS LONG AS TENTH, 11th GRADE IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAD A BUDDY I CALLED HIM PROFESSOR, HE CALLED ME THE DOCTOR. WE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER. WE WENT TO THE SAME UNIVERSITY, AND NOW WE'RE STILL THE BEST OF FRIENDS LIVING IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA, PLAYING GOLF AGAINST EACH OTHER.
Stephen:  THAT AND MANY OTHER STORIES ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN "DR. J.:  AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY." YOU NOT ONLY PLAYED BASKETBALL. YOU CHANGED THE GAME OF BASKETBALL.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
Stephen:  WELL I THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. BECAUSE BEFORE YOU THERE WAS NO--
WELL, THERE WAS, ACTUALLY.
Stephen:  NO TWOULD BE A BETTER BOOK IF THERE WASN'T.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I USED TO WATCH THE BIG GUYS, AND I WOULD SEE THEM DUNK THE BALL.
AND WOULD SEE THEM DO THINGS AROUND THE HOOP, AND I ALWAYS IMAGINED MYSELF DOING THAT. AND SO, WHEN I GOT BIG ENOUGH TO DO IT, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT JUST LIKE THEY DID IT. I WANTED TO DO IT MY OWN WAY. AND --
Stephen:  WITH A LITTLE STYLE.
AND I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT, YOU KNOW, TO HAVE SOME INNOVATION.
Stephen:  WHAT IS THAT LIKE? WHAT WILL PEOPLE-- WHAT WAS-- WHEN YOU WOULD TAKE OFF FROM THE FOUL LINE AND JUST-- JUST SAIL LIKE AN ANGEL THROUGH THE AIR AND COME THUNDERING DOWN IN VEFNLENCE UPON WHY YOU WERE ENEMIES BY PUTTING THE BALL RIGHT THROUGH THE HOOP AND SWEAT SPRAYING OFF YOU LIKE A FOG OF TESTOSTERONE THAT WOULD SUCK THE LADIES OUT OF STANDS INTO THE BACK SEAT OF YOUR LIMO, WHAT WAS THAT FEELING? WHAT WAS THAT SPHEELG LIKE?
IT WAS EPIC. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT YOU KNOW I WAS INSPIRED BY NEW YORK. YOU KNOW, I GREW UP HERE IN NEW YORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO WHEN I GOT BIG ENOUGH AND BAD ENOUGH TO PLAY UPTOWN WITH THE BIG BOYS, THEY'D BE SIT OOGHT EDGE OF THE-- ON THE EDGE OF THE PLAYGROUND WITH THEIR FEAT ON THE COURT, AND YOU'D COME DOWN AND MAKE A MOVE AND GO TO THE HOOP, AND YOU'D GO RUNNING BACK DOWN THE COURT, IT'S LIKE, "YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. YOU CAN JUMP FROM FARTHER OUT THAN THAT." CHALLENGING YOU IN A SPECIAL WAY. AND SOMETIMES I'D BE GULLIBLE ENOUGH TO GO FOR IT. I COULD PROBABLY JUMP FROM A LITTLE FARTHER OUT, EIGHT FEET OUR, 10 FEET OUT, 12 FEET OUT. THE FOUL LINE WAS 15 FEET OUT. SO THAT WAS THE ULTIMATE TO BE ABLE TO JUMP FROM THE FOUL LINE. THAT'S HOW I HONED THAT SKILL. I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE PEOPLE SITTING ON THE SIDELINES IN HARL WOMEN THEIR FEET ON THE COURT BECAUSE THEY SAID, "WE THINK YOU CAN DO IT." AND I DID. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  YOU'VE SEEN SOME GREAT IN YOUR TIME-- LARRY BIRD, YOU PLAYED AGAINST KAREEM. WOULD YOU LIKE TO FACE OFF WITH THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME RIGHT NOW?
I'M DOWN LIKE REBOUND.
Stephen:  WATCH THIS. HERE WE GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). 10? 10 BALLS OF PAPER. THERE'S THE BASKET. THERE IT IS. READY?
YUP. IS IT THE RACE FOR WHO GETS THE MOST --
Stephen:  YOU CAN TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED, OLD MAN.
HE'S GOT THAT RIGHT. I AM OLD.
Stephen:  DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A SHOT FIRST?
I'LL TAKE A SHOT FIRST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOT BAD. NOT BAD FOR A COUNTRY BOY. HE'S BEEN PROOK-- PRACTICING. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  IT'S JUST PAPER, MAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT SIX? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT SIX?
Stephen:  7. >>7!
Stephen:  OKAY, LAST TWO, LAST TWO.
WAIT A MINUTE. OH, OKAY. I CAN GET TO SEVEN.
Stephen:  OKAY HIT SEVEN.
I CAN GET TO SEVEN.
Stephen:  CAN YOU GET TO SEVEN?
I CAN GET TO SEVEN NOW. TURN AROUND, LIKE YOU.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
