Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WHOO! THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, IF YOU'VE WATCHED THIS SHOW NIGHT AFTER NIGHT FOR NINE YEARS, AND I HOPE YOU HAVE I BELIEVE IN GIVING YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ASK ABOUT THE SHED IN MY YARD. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST UP, WITH REPUBLICANS SET TO TAKE OVER CONGRESS IN JANUARY, I HAVE BEEN APPALLED TO SEE BARACK OBAMA BRAZENLY STILL BEING PRESIDENT. CASE IN EXECUTIVE OVERREACH, THIS WEEKEND, HE NAMED HIS CHOICE TO SUCCEED ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCES HE WANTS U.S. ATTORNEY LORETTA LYNCH TO TAKE OVER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 55-YEAR-OLD LYNCH WOULD BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO HOLD THE POST OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.
SHE HAS SPENT YEARS IN THE TRENCHES AS A PROSECUTOR AGGRESSIVELY FIGHTING TERRORISM, FINANCIAL FRAUD, CYBERCRIME, ALL THE WHILE VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING CIVIL RIGHTS.
I WILL WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MY FIRST THOUGHT.
Stephen: HER FIRST WAKING THOUGHT IS PROTECTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? APPARENTLY, SHE'S GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO WHILE SHE'S ASLEEP. (LAUGHTER)    OH, I'M SORRY. I GUESS SHE'S TOO BUSY RIDING A UNICORN TO A TEST THAT SHE'S LATE FOR NAKED. FOLKS, THAT FACT IS LYNCH SIMPLY ISN'T QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB I READ ALL ABOUT IT OVER THE WEEKEND, WHEN BRIETBART.GOV JOURNALIST AND WILFORD BRIMLEY TRIBUTE HEAD, WARNER TODD HUSTON, BLEW THE LID OFF THE SCANDAL THAT LYNCH WAS "A PART OF BILL CLINTON'S WHITEWATER PROBE DEFENSE TEAM IN 1992". KIDS, IF YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER, WHITEWATER WAS THE BENGHAZI OF ARKANSAS REAL ESTATE. (LAUGHTER) THE BOMBSHELL DESTROYS LORETTA LYNCH'S CREDIBILITY TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IF IT WERE TRUE. BUT IT TURNS OUT, TEDDY ROOSEVELT HERE HAD THE WRONG LORETTA LYNCH. THIS IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE.  THIS IS THE ONE WHO DEFENDED CLINTON DURING WHITEWATER. AND THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO TELL THESE TWO WOMEN APART. (LAUGHTER) BUT AS SOON AS WALRUS-MAN NOTICED THE MISTAKE, BRIETBART ISSUED A CORRECTION BY LEAVING UP THE SAME HEADLINE AND ADDING THE WORD "CORRECTED." FROM THERE, IT'S THE EXACT SAME ARTICLE ABOUT HOW OBAMA'S LORETTA LYNCH DEFENDED THE CLINTONS UNTIL YOU GET TO THE  VERY BOTTOM OF THE ARTICLE, WHERE IT READS, "CORRECTION: THE LORETTA LYNCH IDENTIFIED EARLIER AS THE WHITEWATER ATTORNEY  WAS, IN FACT, A DIFFERENT ATTORNEY." (LAUGHTER) SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO BREITBART FOR BREAKING THIS NEWS, FINDING   OUT IT'S BROKEN, BUT STICKING WITH THE STORY ANYWAY. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE NO MATTER WHO SHE ACTUALLY IS, I STILL STAND AGAINST THE NOMINATION OF LORETTA LYNCH. I JUST DON'T THINK A COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER HAS ANY PLACE AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. (LAUGHTER) PLUS, WHY ISN'T ANYONE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME SHE STOLE CHRISTMAS? IT'S SCANDALOUS! (LAUGHTER) SO I SALUTE BREITBART FOR NOT TAKING DOWN A HEADLINE THAT YOU KNOW IS FALSE. YOU ARE CRAVEN POLITICAL HATCHET MEN. OH, THEY EVENTUALLY TOOK IT DOWN? MY APOLOGIES. THEY ARE CRAVEN POLITICAL HATCHET MEN. CORRECTED. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
