Stephen:  WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW, YOU READ THE PAPERS, YOU KNOW THAT WE AMERICANS LIVE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED ERA OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, FROM TABLETS TO SMARTPHONES TO FUTURISTIC GLASSES THAT INSTANTLY SEND THE MESSAGE,  I'M A DOUCHE. NOW THERE'S A NEW APP THAT HAS EXPANDED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR COMMUNICATION BY DRASTICALLY REDUCING THEM.
THERE'S A NEW SMARTPHONE APP SIMPLY CALLED YO. USERS CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE FREE APP AND PUSH ONE BUTTON TO  SEND THE WORD YO TO A CONTACT. SO FAR, 50,000 USERS HAVE SENT ABOUT FOUR MILLION YO'S.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, YO, AN APP ALREADY HUGELY POPULAR WITH THE WORLD'S POPULATION OF SYLVESTER STALLONE. NOW, WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT AN APP THAT BOILS DOWN ALL YOUR COMMUNICATION INTO TWO LETTERS, I EXPRESSED MYSELF IN ONE. Y? ( APPLAUSE ) BUT I JOINED--   ( CHEERS ) I JOINED THE YO-TH MOVEMENT WHEN I READ THE COMPANY BOASTS IT TAKES 11 TAPS TO SEND THE WORD YO ON A RIVAL MESSAGING SERVICE COMPARED TO TWO ON THEIR APP. THAT'S A NINE-TAP DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE. TAPS YOU COULD BE SPENDING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE TRUE BEAUTY OF ONLY SAYING YO IS IT SAYS SO MUCH. AS ITS DEVELOPER PUTS IT WE LIKE TO CALL IT CONTEXT-BASED MESSAGING. YOU UNDERSTAND BY THE CONTEXT WHAT IS BEING SAID. CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING. IN THE OLD DAYS IF I TEXTED SOMEONE THE WORD YO, AND I WANTED THEM TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANT, I HAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH GURT. AND YO IS ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS. FOR INSTANCE, AN ICE CREAM TRUCK CAN YO THE KIDS WHEN ITS  AROUND THE CORNER. IMAGINE GETTING A YO FROM THE ICE CREAM TRUCK, AND PARENTS CAN SIGN UP TO TELL THEIR KIDS TO STAY AWAY FROM ANYONE WITH THE USER NAME "THEICECREAMTRUCK." BUT WHY ARE THEY LIMITING THIS BREAKTHROUGH TO JUST OUR PHONES? I BELIEVE WE CAN IMPLEMENT YO'S CONTEXT-BASED COMMUNICATION PHILOSOPHY IN EVERYDAY LIFE. COME ON OUT, JAY. JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YO.
YO.
