Stephen: HEY, WELCOME TO  THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THANK YOU. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. IN HERE, OUT THERE, I THANK YOU  FOR SUPPORT ON A NIGHTLY BASIS  BECAUSE YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WATCH THIS  SHOW, YOU KNOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- YOU KNOW THAT I GET UP HERE  EVERY NIGHT AND I ALWAYS SAY HOW  I FEEL. PLEASE -- I'M ALWAYS SAYING HOW  I FEEL. SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT AGREE BUT I  GOTS TO DO WHAT I DO. TONIGHT I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A  LIMB AND SAY I'M AGAINST A GIANT  ASTEROID DESTROYING THE EARTH. I DON'T CARE FIT LOSES ME  SPONSORS. THESE ARE BAD NEWS. A CHUNK OF ONE ATTACKED RUSSIA  BUT LUCKILY PUTIN PUNCHED IT OUT  OF THE SKY. GOOD NEWS, NATION. THIS WEEK NASA UNVEILED AN  EXCITING NEW PLAN TO FIGHT OUR  SPACE ENEMIES.
NASA PLANS TO LASSO AN  ASTEROID.
NASA WANTS TO LASSO AN AFTER  THE TROID.
AND PARK IT NEXT TO THE MOON.
Stephen: YES, A NASA LASSO  BECAUSE THE MOST ADVANCED  TECHNOLOGY THEY CAN AFFORD WITH THEIR BUDGET IS ROPE. [ LAUGHTER ] LONG TIME OBSERVERS KNOW THAT  NASA FIRST BEGAN WORKING ON THIS  PROGRAM IN 1946.
YOU WANT THE MOON? JUST SAY THE WORLD AND I'LL  THROW A LASSO AROUND IT AND PULL  IT DOWN.
HEY THAT'S A PRETTY IDEA.
Stephen: IT IS A GOOD IDEA. THE PROGRAM LOST FUNDING WHEN  THIS GUY EMBEZZLED IT FROM THE  SAVINGS AND LOANS. HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU IN JAIL! FLORIDA SENATOR AND FORMER  ASTRONAUT BILL NELSON SAID THIS  WOULD HELP NASA HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO NUDGE AWAY A AFTER  ASTEROID AWAY FROM EARTH. IF NUDGING DOESN'T WORK THEY  COULD DEVELOP COACHING  TECHNOLOGY. I LOVE A PLAN TO DRAG AN  ASTEROID INTO EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE  BECAUSE NOTHING EM BODIES THE SPIRIT OF AMERICAN LAZINESS LIKE  BRINGING SPACE TO US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THIS -- THIS, LADIES AND LADIES   GENTLEMEN, IS THE LAND OF  CONVENIENCE. YOU CAN'T EXPECT US TO TRAVEL  MILLIONS OF MILES TO. DPRK -- TO EXTRACT MEDIA  SEDIMENT, I MEAN "THE BACHELOR"  IS ON. CONGRATULATIONS NASA FOR  SPACE-PLOATION. I DREAM OF A DAY WHEN ONE SMALL  STEP FOR MAN IS LITERALLY ONE  STEP BECAUSE WE PARKED THE MOON OUTSIDE THE KENNEDY STAIS  CENTER. FOLKS, WE'VE LOST OUR WAY AS A  NATION. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS NOW  SUPPORT AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS AND MARRIAGE FOR THE GAYS AND NOW WE'VE LOST ANOTHER  MORAL BATTLE.
A PUPIL SAYS MOST AMERICANS  THINK MARIJUANA SHOULD BE LEGAL. THIS THE IS FIRST TIME PEW HAS  HAS HAD THIS RESULT.
TIMES ARE CHANGING, SOMETHING  IS BLOWING IN THE WIND. THEY SAY.
Stephen: EVERYTHING IS SO  FUNNY WHEN YOU'RE HIGH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT THE MEDICAL  MARIJUANA IN 18 STATES AND  RECREATIONAL POT IS NOW LEGAL IN BOTH COLORADO AND WASHINGTON AND  THOSE TWO STATES ARE PLANNING TO  TURN IDAHO INTO A BONG. LA LAUGH EVEN WORSE, -- [LAUGHTER] NOW, EVEN WORSE, PEOPLE ARE  COMPARING THIS POT-TASTROPE.
A MAJORITY OF IN FAVOR OF  LEGALIZING MAYOR JUAN WHY AND  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
IT'S A GENERATIONAL SHIFT. THE EVOLUTION OF SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE AND SAME THING WITH  MARIJUANA.
Stephen: I CAN'T HELP WHO I  AM. I WAS BORN ATTRACTED TO WATCHING  SEVEN HOURS OF PLANET EARTH  WHILE EATING A SACK OF CROUTONS. NEXT THING YOU KNOW STONERS WILL  DEMAND THE CIVIL RIGHT TO MARRY  THEIR MARY JANE. YOU MAY NOW SMOKE THE BRIDE. IT'S NOT LIKE THE WAR ON DRUGS  ISN'T WORKING. LOOK AT THE ANIMATED CHART. THE BLUE LINE SHOWS RATES OF  ADDICTION SINCE 1970 AND THE  GREEN LINE SHOWS HOW MUCH MONEY WE SPENT ON THE WAR ON DRUGS. THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THE WAR ON  DRUGS IS A WASTE BUT IF YOU ARE  HIGH IT LOOKS LIKE A MOUNTAIN WITH A STREAM RUNNING OUT OF IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND NOW POLITICS ARE COZYING UP  TO BIG SPLEEF LIKE  PROLEGALLIZATION COLORADO  CONGRESSMAN WHO SAID MARIJUANA OUTPERFORMED ME BY TEN POINTS SO  IT WAS A GREAT ASSOCIATION FOR  ME WHEN HE WON. MARTIN THE FIRST TIME MARIJUANA  IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN ANYTHING  BUT SWIMMING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SADLY, EVEN REPUBLICAN  POLITICIANS HAVE STARTED BUYING  THE DRUG CULTURE PUSHERS ARE  SELLING.
THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTS COULD  HAVE BEEN PUT IN JAIL FOR THEIR  DRUG USE. I THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE  HAPPENED. IT WOULD HAVE RUINED THEIR  LIVES. A LOT OF POOR KIDS DON'T GET  LUCKY. THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD ATTORNEYS  AND THEY GO TO JAIL FOR THESE  THINGS AND IT'S A MISTAKE.
Stephen: IT'S THEIR OWN  DAMN FAULT. IF THE KIDS WANT TO RUN AROUND  BREAKING LAWS WITHOUT  CONSEQUENCES THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE INTO BANKING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT NATION, THERE MAY BE SOME  SORT OF POLITICAL METHOD TO RAND  PAUL'S REEFER MADNESS. SOMETHING LIKE MYSELF COULD  APPEAL TO YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE  SOME OF THEM THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO PUT KIDS IN JAIL FOR  MARIJUANA USE AND THROW AWAY THE  KEY.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT RAND  PAUL, HE'S PROPOT AND IF YOU GET  HIGH ENOUGH MAYBE YOU'LL FORGET ALL THE REASONS YOU WOULDN'T  VOTE FOR HIM. EVEN THOUGH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  IS DESPERATE FOR THE YOUTH VOTE. I DON'T WANT REPUBLICAN  PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS LIKE MARCO  RUBE YES SUDDENLY SELLING OUT THEIR VALUES TO GET IN WITH THE  COOL KIDS AND IT MIGHT BE TOO  LATE BECAUSE HE HAS A SERIOUS TASTE OF COTTON MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY MIGHT HAVE TO GET HIGH TO  GET RELEVANT. GOOD LUCK GETTING ANYONE TO SAY  THAT ON TEAM HERE TO SAY THAT ON  TV IS REASON.COM EDITOR AND CHIEF NICK GILL DLRKS ESPIE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING  HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? HOW DID WE RUN UP THE WHITE FLAG  IN THE WAR ON DRUGS? NANCY REAGAN LOSES, CHEECH AND  CHONG WIN. HOW DID WE GET HERE?
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS WE  GREW UP AS A COUNTRY. ENOUGH OF US HAVE BEEN AROUND  WHERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR WORST  FRIEND, DO YOU WANT TO DEAL WITH HIM WHEN HE IS HIGH OR DRUNK? BEING HIGH ISN'T SO BAD --  COMPARED -- I'M SAYING HE NOT  YOU. BUT THAT'S PART OF IT. POT HAS BEEN ILLEGAL SINCE THE  1930'S.
Stephen: BECAUSE OF REEFER  MADNESS. HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE? IT'S A GATEWAY DRUG. IT LEADS TO MURDER AND  INTERRACIAL DATING.
THAT'S RIGHT AND BAD POT  SMOKING. PART OF IT IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE  SEEN AFTER 70 YEARS EVERY ASPECT  OF PROHIBITION MAKES THINGS  WORSE. IF DRUG PROHIBITION WORKED, THE  MARKETS AROUND DRUGS WOULDN'T BE  VIOLENT. THEY ARE MORE VIOLENT THAN EVER. IF YOU HAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE  PROBLEM YOU ARE SAYING TO PEOPLE  YOU ARE A CRIMINAL AND ADDICT. IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR ADDICTS TO  GET HELP NOW. YOU WILL ALL THE WAR ON POT DOES  WHICH IS THE ONLY ILLEGAL DRUG  THAT ANYBODY USES IN REAL  NUMBERS.
Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD OF  METH? WE'RE COOKING METH DOWN HERE  RIGHT NOW. METH LABS EVERYWHERE, RIGHT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S EVERYWHERE.
IT IS EVERYWHERE.
Stephen: IT'S A GATEWAY  DRUG. POT, METH, HEROIN, GAY. IT'S A GAY-WAY.
VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER  USED METH HAVE YOU EVER USED  METH?
Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TO  ANSWER THAT.
YOUR SHOW. TWO TENTHS OF AMERICANS HAVE  USED METH. FOR POT IT'S 7% OR 8%. MOST PEOPLE WHO USE POT IT'S  LIKE DRINKING BEER. THERE'S NO REASON FOR POT TO BE  TREATED DIFFERENTLY.
Stephen: WE WERE SOLD  MEDICAL MARIJUANA WITH THE  EXPLICIT PROMISE THAT THIS WAS NOT TO LEGALIZE IT FOR  RECREATIONAL USE. IT'S A BAIT AND SWITCH, BUDDY. THEY GOT THE HOOK IN US, RIGHT.
COLORADO SAY GOOD STATE TO  LOOK AT BECAUSE LEGALIZED  RECREATIONAL POT FOR EVERYBODY. IT HAD MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR A  BETTER PART OF A DECADE. POT IS GOOD MEDICINE DESPITE THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS. THEY CAN USE IT FOR.
Stephen: WE WERE TOLD IT  WAS NOT RECREATIONAL MAR JUAN. WHAT THE IS NEXT PROSTITUTION? YOU ARE A LIBERTARIAN. HOW ABOUT MEDICAL PROSTITUTION? YOU KNOW, A LITTLE SEXUAL  FEELING, BABY, SOUNDS GOOD TO  ME! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS  THAT POT -- POT IS USED BY A LOT  OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: THEY ARE USED  USERS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S NOT A FRINGE THING. MANY NORMAL PEOPLE, MANY AVERAGE  PEOPLE USE IT. THEY USE IT RESPONSIBLY. IT MAKES THEIR LIFE A LITTLE BIT  BETTER. IF WE TAKE AWAY THE PROHIBITION  WE TAKE AWAY THE CRIME  ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
Stephen: IF WE STOP MAKING  IT ILLEGAL WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR  PRIVATE PRISON INDUSTRY BECAUSE THOSE PRISONS ARE FILLED WITH  POT USERS AND THROWS GOOD  INCARCERATION JOBS.
THIS IS WHERE RAND ST. PAUL  AHEAD OF PRESIDENT. HE IS SAYING WE NEED SENTENCING  REFORM. WE'VE FILLED THE STATE AND  FEDERAL PRISONS WITH NONVIOLENT  DRUG OFFENDERS. WE KICK OUT VIOLENT PEOPLE WHO  SHOULD BE IN PRISON WHO ARE AN  ACTUAL THREAT TO SOCIETY.
Stephen: WHAT HEROIN IS  LEGAL AND WE'RE ALL STRUNG OUT,  PLEASE COME BACK TO APOLOGIZE. FROM REASON.COM NICK
