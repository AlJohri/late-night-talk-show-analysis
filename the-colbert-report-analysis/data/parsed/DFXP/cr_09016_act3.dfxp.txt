Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH GOVERNOR  MITCH DANIELS WITH HIS NEW  BOOK, KEEPING THE REP ECK,  ALL RIGHT, GOVERNOR DANIELS, YOU ARE THE GOVERNOR OF  INDIANA. THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT  OF DUST UP IN THE SENATE  RACE IN INDIANA.
HEARD A RUMOR.
Stephen: YES,  MR. MOURDOCK HAS RAISED SOME  HACKLES BY SAYING ON THE  SENSITIVE ISSUE OF ABORTION THAT IF SOMEONE GETS  PREGNANT FROM A RAPE, THAT  WAS INTENDED TO HAPPEN BY  GOD. OKAY. ARE YOU ENDORSING POUR DOCK  FOR SENATE?
I'M A NONCOMBATANT,  ACTUALLY, IN DEFERENCE TO MY  NEW JOB AT PURDUE.
Stephen: I AM.
I'M NOT TRYING TO DODGE  THE QUESTION.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT  TRYING TO BUT ARE YOU.
ON SOME JUSTIFICATION ON  THE DAY I ACCEPTED THE NEW  JOB AT PURDUE WITH THEIR  NONPARTISAN STATUS I SAID I WOULD RECUSE MYSELF FROM  ANYTHING PARTISAN, AND I  HAVE. I HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY ROLL IN  THE CAMPAIGN FOR OR AGAINST  ANYBODY, AS SORT OF A VOW OF  POLITICAL CELIBACY.
Stephen: OKAY, WHY AN  MORE REPUBLICANS TAKING THAT  VOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE  WORD "RAPE" BECAUSE LAST NIGHT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS  ON THE SHOW. OKAY, I'M A CONSERVATIVE,  PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN  FEELINGS ABOUT ABORTION. I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR HOW I  FEEL ABOUT IT ON THIS SHOW.
BUT LISTEN, I GUESS I  WOULD SAY THIS AND THE BOOK  SAYS THIS, INCIDENTALLY,  THAT THIS IS A QUESTION, AND THERE ARE OTHERS, ON WHICH  PEOPLE HAVE VERY SINCERE, ON  BOTH SIDES, AND DEEP  PERSONAL VIEWS. AND WE'RE TO THE GOING TO  AGREE ABOUT THEM. AND FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK  ANYTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE  IN ANY DIRECTION FAIRLY  SOON.
Stephen: I AGREE WITH YOU,  ABORTION IS A VERY DIVISIVE  ISSUE, PEOPLE AREN'T GOING  AGREE ON IT. RAPE WE'VE GENERALLY AGREED  ON IN THE PAST. RAPE HAS NOT BEEN A DEVICIVE  ISSUE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU'RE ACTUALLY LEAVING  DECEMBER 31st IS YOUR LAST  DAY IN OFFICE.
CLOSE, EARLY JANUARY.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE  MOVING ON TO PURDUE.
I'M PROUD TO SAY, ONE OF  THE GREAT UNIVERSITIES OF  THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: AS GOVERNOR YOU  CUT $30 MILLION IN PURDUE'S  BUDGET IS THAT GOING TO BE  AWKWARD IN THE LUNCH LINE WHEN YOU'RE THERE? ARE THEY GOING TO SAY SORRY  THE FOOD IS SO CRAPPY BUT  SOMEBODY CUT $30 MILLION  FROM OUR FOOD BUDGET THIS  YEAR. WHO DO YOU THINK GOING TO  WIN?
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
Stephen: WITHOUT DO YOU  THINK WILL WIN INDIANA.
I THINK GOVERNOR ROMNEY  GOING TO WIN INDIANA, THERE  IS EVERY INDICATION THEY  WILL.
Stephen: AS GOES INDIANA  SO GOES PARTS OF KENTUCKY. WELL, GOVERNOR DANIELS,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MAY I --
I THINK FRANKLY YOU OUGHT  TO COME OUT TO PURDUE, DO  THE SHOW FROM THERE  SOMETIME. THIS WILL BE A REMINDER FOR  YOU, IT'S A-- SEASON YOU  COULD TELL PEOPLE IT STANDS  FOR POPE OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO  MUCH, GOVERNOR.
THANKS A LOT.
Stephen: INDIANA GOVERNOR  MITCH DANIELS. KEEPING THE REPUBLIC. WELL'S BE RIGHT BACK.
