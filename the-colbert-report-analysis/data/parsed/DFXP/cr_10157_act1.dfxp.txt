STEPHEN: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! I DON'T KNOW IF ALL Y'ALL HAVE BEEN CHECKING THE NEWS LATELY. I ASSUME YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION BEFORE YOU COME INTO THE BUILDING. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, FOLKS, THE NFL CONTINUES -- (SIREN) (ALARM) NATION, THIS IS A COLBERT ALERT! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE JUST BEEN HANDED A PIECE OF PAPER. IS THIS PAPER? YES, IT IS. LET'S SEE, THIS JUST IN! IT IS THE FIRST DAY OF FALL! CAN WE CONFIRM THAT? WE CAN. YES, IT IS THE FIRST DAY OF FALL A TIME FOR CHERISHED TRADITIONS. UNPACKING THE SWEATERS, BUYING THAT FIRST PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE, REMEMBERING WE'RE STILL AT WAR WITH AFGHANISTAN. THAT'S WHY YOU'VE HAD A STRING TIED AROUND YOUR FINGER FOR 13 YEARS. YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF NOW AND NOW, THIS WAR HAS REACHED OUR SHORES.
THE F.B.I. IS SEARCHING FOR THREE SOLDIERS FROM AFGHANISTAN MISSING IN MASSACHUSETTS. THE SOLDIERS HAD BEEN TRAINING AT A MILITARY BASE ON CAPE COD.
STEPHEN: FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE TRAINING AFGHAN SOLDIERS IN CAPE COD. ARE YACHTING SKILLS THAT USEFUL IN A LANDLOCKED COUNTRY? (LAUGHTER) AND THEY WON'T GET VERY FAR DOWN THE KHYBER PASS IN PINK PANTS WITH WHALES ON THEM. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE MOST ALARMING NEWS OF ALL IS WHERE WE LOST THESE GUYS.
THEY WERE LAST SEEN AT A LOCAL SHOPPING MALL.
CONCERN GROWING WITH EVERY HOUR THAT THESE THREE ARE MISSING.
STEPHEN: SO, SHOPPERS, BE ON THE LOOKOUT. MEMORIZE THESE FACES! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: THE GUY ON THE END. I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY ON THE END. HE'S GOT A -- AND CHANCES ARE THEY'RE STILL IN THE MALL. WITHDRAWING FROM AFGHANISTAN HAS NOTHING ON THE QUAGMIRE OF AN AMERICAN MALL. THE AVERAGE MALL IS FILLED WITH LOST SOULS, WANDERING BETWEEN KIOSKS, LIVING OFF G.N.C. SUPPLEMENTS AND HOT PRETZEL SMELL, NEVER TO FORGET THE HORRORS THEY WITNESSED AT POTTERY BARN. (LAUGHTER) WHO BUYS A CAGE FOR THEIR PLANT?! IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. AND THOSE MALL MAPS WILL BE USELESS IN TRACKING THEM DOWN. DON'T TELL ME WHERE "I" AM! I WANT TO KNOW WHERE "THEY" ARE! WHAT'S THIS? EXCUSE ME, I'M BEING HANDED A SBARRO'S BOX. IT SAYS THE MISSING AFGHAN TROOPS WERE CAUGHT EARLIER TODAY ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THE CANADIAN BORDER AND WILL LIKELY BE SENT BACK TO AFGHANISTAN. THANK GOD. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THE ONLY REMAINING DANGER IS IF THEY WERE RADICALIZED DURING THEIR TIME AT YANKEE CANDLE. I MEAN, 20 BUCKS FOR A BAHAMA BREEZE PILLAR JAR? SERIOUSLY. "DEATH TO AMERICA!" (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK I'M GOING TO READ THE REST OF THAT LATER. (LAUGHTER) NATION, A WISE MAN ONCE SAID... (LAUGHTER) (BLEEP) KEEP GOING! THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. FIRST UP, YESTERDAY THE ENVIRO-MENTAL PATIENTS CAME OUT OF THEIR YURTS TO PROTEST GLOBAL WARMING IN A PLACE SYNONYMOUS WITH NATURE -- MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.
AN ESTIMATED 300,000 PEOPLE MARCHED THROUGH THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN FOR HOURS TODAY FOR ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.
THIS WAS THE LARGEST CLIMATE PROTEST IN HISTORY.
STEPHEN: YES, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED THE STREETS OF NEW YORK FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. OR WERE IN LINE FOR THE NEW iPHONE. (LAUGHTER) THE EVENT WAS PACKED WITH LEFTY CELEBRITIES LIKE STING, MARK RUFFALO, AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO. YOU'D THINK HE'D BE "FOR" ICEBERGS MELTING. (LAUGHTER) I GUESS HE DIDN'T LOVE ROSE THAT MUCH AFTER ALL. ALSO IN ATTENDANCE, THOUSANDS OF ANGRY COMMUTERS.
THE MARCH SHUT DOWN MAJOR CITY ARTERIES FOR MOST OF THE DAY, SNARLING TRAFFIC INTO THE EVENING.
MOTORISTS TRYING TO MAKE IT DOWN THE WEST SIDE WERE STRANDED FOR HOURS.
I SAT IN TRAFFIC FOR TWO HOURS.
I GOT SO ANGRY AND ENRAGED. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET CRAZY?
STEPHEN: YOU HEAR THAT, GREENIES? YOU LOST HODA KOTB! AND AS GOES HODA, SO GOES THE NATION. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SURE WHICH NATION. I'M GONNA SAY THE ONE THAT PRODUCES THE MOST MERLOT. (LAUGHTER) SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT -- WHY DON'T I DRINK WINE DURING MY SHOW? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. (LAUGHTER) SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO CLIMATE CHANGE MARCHERS FOR MAKING THOUSANDS OF CARS BURN TWO EXTRA HOURS OF GASOLINE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE THERE THIS WEEKEND. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO. (LAUGHTER) I STILL SHOWED SOLIDARITY WITH THE TRAPPED MOTORISTS BY KEEPING MY CAR RUNNING ALL WEEKEND. OF COURSE, I DIDN'T WANT TO ANGER MY LIBERAL NEIGHBORS, SO I KEPT THE GARAGE DOOR CLOSED. I GOTTA SAY, THE WEEKEND JUST FLEW BY! AND I MET THE NICEST EMT CREW. NEXT UP, FOLKS, IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THE NATION WAS MORE DIVIDED. EVEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR, AT LEAST BOTH SIDES AGREED ON IRONIC FACIAL HAIR. THESE DAYS, THINGS IN WASHINGTON ARE SO HOSTILE THAT, ACCORDING TO THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE, "FULLY 75% OF SALIENT NATIONAL ISSUES ARE GRIDLOCKED IN CONGRESS ." WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE ONLY BIPARTISAN BILL TO PASS THIS YEAR WAS "H.R. 594 EAT A BAG OF DICKS." (LAUGHTER) SAILED THROUGH. UNANIMOUS. BUT TWO SENATORS HAVE TAKEN A BOLD STEP TO END THE GRIDLOCK.
REALITY SHOWS JUST MIGHT BE THE ANSWER TO FINDING MORE BIPARTISANSHIP ON CAPITOL HILL. AT LEAST THAT'S THE HOPE OF TWO U.S. SENATORS. NEW MEXICO DEMOCRAT MARTIN HEINRICH  AND ARIZONA REPUBLICAN JEFF FLAKE SPENT A WEEK TOGETHER ON A REMOTE ISLAND FOR A NEW REALITY SHOW. IT'S CALLED "RIVAL SURVIVAL."
STEPHEN: YES, "RIVAL SURVIVAL"! IT COMBINES THE EXOTIC LOCALES OF THE AMAZING RACE, THE VOYEURISTIC THRILL OF "BIG BROTHER" AND THE RACIAL DIVERSITY OF THE BACHELOR. (LAUGHTER) SO I WANT TO GIVE A TIP OF THE HAT TO THESE SENATORS FOR PROVING REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS "CAN" WORK TOGETHER. ALL IT TAKES IS THE THREAT OF DEATH. (LAUGHTER)    JIM?
AS WE ARRIVED, CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE EITHER THE CONDITIONS TO CREATE A FIRE OR THE TIME AND REALLY HAD TO FOCUS ON THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS WHICH WAS FINDING SOMETHING TO DRINK AND MAKING SURE WE HAD A SHELTER BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO RAIN THROUGH THE NIGHT. WE FOUND A COCONUT GROVE. JUST THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF COCONUTS. THAT'S A LOT OF COCONUT WATER WHICH WAS A LIFESAVER TODAY. WE REALLY NEEDED THAT.
STEPHEN: THANK GOD THEY FOUND THOSE COCONUTS. HOW WOULD THEY POSSIBLY FIND WATER IN THE MIDDLE OF A DRIVING RAINSTORM? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO IT'S NO SURPRISE DISCOVERY HAS GONE ALL IN AND COMMITTED THEM TO A FULL ONE EPISODE. (LAUGHTER) BUT CONGRESS CAN'T STOP HERE. THEY CAN COME TOGETHER TO PRODUCE MORE REALITY TV. I SAY DITCH JOHN BOEHNER, MAKE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JEFF PROBST. INSTEAD OF BORING LEGISLATION, EVERY MORNING HE'LL PASS OUT CHALLENGES LIKE BLOCK THE FARM BILL OR YOU HAVE TO EAT A BUG. (LAUGHTER) MITCH MCCONNELL GETS IMMUNITY BECAUSE HIS DIET IS ALREADY CRICKETS. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN IF WE DIDN'T TURN CONGRESS INTO A TELEVISED LORD OF THE FLIES, THERE'S STILL ONE THING THAT CONGRESS CAN ALWAYS AGREE ON.
THE HOUSE JUST VOTED IN A RARE BIPARTISAN VOTE TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO TRAIN THE MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION.
THE SENATE WENT ALONG WITH THE HOUSE, APPROVING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN.
A RARE VOTE OF BIPARTISAN APPROVAL.
A RARE SHOW OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.
WE CERTAINLY WELCOME THE BIPARTISAN SHOW OF SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS, THAT IS A PHENOMENON TOO RARE THESE DAYS.
WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICA'S NATIONAL SECURITY, AMERICA IS UNITED.
STEPHEN: YES, AMERICANS HAVE PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES AND COME TOGETHER FOR A GREATER CAUSE -- GIVING DEADLY WEAPONS TO PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. (APPLAUSE) ALL I'M SAYING IS "GIVE WAR A CHANCE." (LAUGHTER) AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
AMERICA IS READY TO BE AMERICA AGAIN. THAT SHOULD BE THE SOLUTION. WE'RE TIRED OF BEING BLACK AMERICAN, GAY AMERICAN, HISPANIC-AMERICAN. LET'S JUST BE AMERICANS AGAIN. WE'VE GOT THESE PEOPLE WE HAVE TO KILL. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: G-GUT IS JUST ECHOING THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF DR. KING, "I HAVE BEEN TO THE MOUNTAINTOP, AND IT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK. YOU'VE GOT THE HIGHER GROUND ." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
