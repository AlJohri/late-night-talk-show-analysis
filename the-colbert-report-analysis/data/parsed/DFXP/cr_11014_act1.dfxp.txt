(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, MR. AND MRS. AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! FOLKS, IF YOU CHECK YOUR CALENDAR, I HOPE YOU DO, EVERY DAY, NATION, WE ARE JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY FROM THE MOST HALLOWED OF ALL EENS, HALLOWEEN. (LAUGHTER) I'M SO GOOD AT TRICK OR TREATING. PRO TIP:  CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN, GO STRAIGHT TO THE DRUG STORE, BUY YOUR CANDY. NOVEMBER 1, IT'S USUALLY ON SALE. SO I WILL MONSTER MASH ANYONE OUT THERE WHO THREATENS  THIS SACRED PAGAN HOLIDAY. THIS IS THE WAR ON HALLOWEEN. (WIND BLOWING, KNOCKING, SCREAMING) FOLKS, WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR PEOPLE ASSAULTING OUR TRADITIONAL HALLOWEEN VALUES, THE FIRST PLACE I TURN IS  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WEBSITES. AND I AM NEVER DISAPPOINTED AT HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM. FOR INSTANCE, THIS YEAR, UNCLE SAM IS GOING AFTER MY FAVORITE PART OF HALLOWEEN:  CARVING THE PUMPKIN. DRIVING A 12-INCH CHEF'S KNIFE INTO A TOUGH-YET-SLIPPERY GOURD HIDE IS A GREAT WAY TO GET RID OF ANY EXCESS THUMBS YOU'VE GOT LAYING AROUND YOUR HAND. BUT JUST LISTEN TO HOW BIG GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO CARVE ITS OWN AGENDA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTS YOU TO DO, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY? THIS HALLOWEEN, RATHER THAN CARVE OUT SOMETHING SCARY OR A JACK-O'-LANTERN IN THE FACE OF THAT $45 PUMPKIN YOU BUY, WHY DON'T YOU DO ONE OF FIVE GREEN ENERGY DESIGNS LIKE THE C.F.L. LIGHT BULB OR A WINDMILL OR SOME LEAVES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? ISN'T THAT A GREAT IDEA?
Stephen: NO, IT'S NOT A GREAT IDEA. IT'S NOT. THE GLOBAL WARMING AGENDA HAS NO PLACE IN OUR SPOOKY-TIME FUN. WE DON'T KNOW IF CLIMATE CHANGE IS MANMADE. I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF FRANKENSTEIN IS MANMADE. THE MAD SCIENCE ISN'T IN YET! BESIDES, THE WHOLE REASON WE CARVE PUMPKINS ON HALLOWEEN IS TO PROVE OUR DOMINANCE OVER NATURE. THAT'S WHY WE STAB A PUMPKIN IN THE FACE AND THEN DISPLAY IT ON OUR FRONT PORCHES AS A WARNING TO THE OTHER VEGETABLES. HERE'S A MESSAGE FOR YOUR BUDDIES BACK ON THE FARM! YOU TELL THAT SQUASH I'M COMING FOR HIM WITH NUTMEG AND CHICKEN STOCK! I WILL MAKE HIS LIFE A LIVING SOUP! AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY FLAMING BAG OF GOVERNMENT THEY'RE LEAVING ON OUR FRONT PORCH. EVIDENTLY,  THE FDA'S WEBSITE DEMANDS THAT, BEFORE GOING BOBBING FOR APPLES, YOU MIGHT WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BACTERIA THAT MIGHT  BE PRESENT ON APPLES BY THOROUGHLY RINSING THEM UNDER  COOL RUNNING WATER. GREAT TIP. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR APPLES ARE SPARKLINGLY CLEAN BEFORE DROPPING THEM INTO A LUKEWARM CESSPOOL OF TODDLER TODDLER SNOT. THAT'S WHY I CALL IT "BOBBING FOR PINK EYE" HUGE CONJUNCTIVITUS FANS HERE TONIGHT. AND THE NANNY STATE GOONS WON'T EVEN LET US ENJOY OUR SWEET MEATS BECAUSE MANY HALLOWEEN CANDIES CONTAIN PALM OIL, AND THE THUGS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ARE NOW DEMANDING THAT WE READ OUR LABELS! PALM OIL PLANTATIONS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO ANIMAL HABITAT LOSS AROUND THE WORLD. OH, I HAVE SUCH HAPPY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES OF RUSHING HOME TO "READ" MY CANDY. BESIDES, THE BEST PART OF CANDY IS HARM TO ANIMAL HABITATS AND CANDY COMPANIES KNOW THIS, THAT'S WHY THEY PROMOTE THEIR INGREDIENTS RIGHT ON THE LABEL. FOR PETE'S SAKE, KIT KATS  ARE MADE FROM GROUND-UP KITTENS, AND KATTENS. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DELICIOUS! CRUNCHY! THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CRUNCHY! GIVE ME A BREAK. OF COURSE, THE KITTEN CODDLERS OUT THERE DON'T WANT YOU TO EAT YOUR PETS. THAT'S ILLEGAL, THEY SAY. WELL, NOT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE A DOG FOR DINNER IN PENNSYLVANIA, THANKS TO THE N.R.A. (BOOING)   NO, IT'S TRUE. THAT WAS SPOOKY, THOUGH. TO FIND OUT HOW THIS WHOLE THING STARTED, LET'S GO TO WPVI, PENNSYLVANIA'S NEWS LEADER.
THIS WHOLE THING STARTED AFTER A SMALL NUMBER OF BUTCHER SHOPS ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA STARTED SELLING DOG AND CAT MEAT. IN RESPONSE, HOUSE BILL 1750 DESIGNED TO OUTLAW THE HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF COMMON HOUSEHOLD PETS WAS QUICKLY PUT TOGETHER.
THE N.R.A.-OPPOSED BILL NEVER GOT VOTED ON.
THE DAY WILL GO THE N.R.A.'S WAY.
Stephen: WOO! WE DID IT! IT IS STILL LEGAL IN PENNSYLVANIA TO SERVE CAT AND DOG MEAT. SO YOU'RE SAFE FOR NOW, WHITE CASTLE. (APPLAUSE) NOW, I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH THE N.R.A., BUT I DO. ESPECIALLY ABOUT WHY THIS BILL HAD TO DIE.
WHEN THE MEASURE WENT TO THE STATE SENATE, AN AMENDMENT WAS ADDED CALLING FOR A BAN ON LIVE PIGEON SHOOTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AS WELL. THAT ATTRACTED CRITICS FROM THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION.
Stephen: NOW I REALIZE THAT SHOOTING A PIGEON ON THE GROUND MIGHT SEEM LIKE SHOOTING FISH IN A BARREL, BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. FISH DON'T SCREAM. ACCORDING TO THE N.R.A.'S WEBSITE, BANNING THE TIME-HONORED TRADITION OF SHOOTING CAPTIVE PIGEONS MIGHT BEGIN THE SLIDE DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE, AND THE NEXT STOP WILL BE REGULATED SHOOTING GROUNDS. THAT'S RIGHT. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHT TO KILL BIRDS, THE N.R.A. DEFEATED THIS ANTI-PET-EATING BILL. IT'S A HARD BUT NOBLE SACRIFICE. THE DOGS AND CATS HAVE TO DIE, IN ORDER THAT THE PIGEONS MAY ALSO DIE. NOW FOLKS, I DON'T EXPRESSLY CONDONE THE EATING OF PETS. SURE, YOU MAY SAY, "STEPHEN, WHAT ABOUT YOUR ENDORSEMENT OF THE POPULAR CHINESE BRAND OF HIGH-END CAT MEAT STEW, "COLONEL TUXEDO'S HAPPY JOY POWER CAT WITH EATING"? REMEMBER OUR MOTTO:  "RELIABLE STING OF PLEASURE! TRUSTWORTHY OF LUNCH"! WELL, I WOULD SAY, GREG, I STOPPED SELLING THIS PRODUCT A LONG TIME AGO. NOW I ONLY DONATE IT TO SCHOOLS. HAD TO GET RID OF THE STOCK. THE CANS WERE SWELLING. BUT SINCE THE N.R.A. WENT TO SO MUCH TROUBLE, I SHOWED MY SUPPORT BY ORDERING N.R.A. C.E.O. "WAYNE LAPIERRE'S 101 RECIPES FOR YOUR HOUSEHOLD PET." DON'T THESE SOUND DELICIOUS? A BEAGLE WITH CREAM CHEESE, GERMAN SHEPHERD'S PIE, OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELTIE, AND CHICKEN POODLE SOUP. IT'S MM-MMM GOOD BOY! OF COURSE, THE THE MIDTERMS ARE NEXT WEEK IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW EATING-FIDO-GATE WILL AFFECT   THE RACE BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR AND HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL WHO'S GOING TO LET THIS GO "JUST ONCE,"  TOM CORBETT,  AND DEMOCRAT CHALLENGER AND GUY WHO  WOULD "LOVE" TO SHOW YOU  HIS DULCIMER PIANO, TOM WOLF. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS RACE CLOSELY, EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN SEE THE GAP IN THE POLLS FROM SPACE BECAUSE WOLF IS BEATING CORBETT BY 17 POINTS. CORBETT HAS ESPECIALLY FAILED TO ATTRACT MINORITIES, WITH A RECENT POLL PUTTING HIS NON-WHITE SUPPORT AT 9%. THE ONLY THING KEEPING CORBETT AFLOAT IS HIS ROCK-SOLID SUPPORT AMONGST ALBINO HEDGEHOGS. I DON'T GET IT. THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT BLACK PEOPLE LOVE TOM CORBETT. LOOK AT THIS PHOTO ON HIS WEBSITE. SHOWING HIM INCHES FROM A BLACK WOMAN WHO COULDN'T BE HAPPIER ABOUT IT. BUT, OF COURSE, THE LIBERAL MEDIA ARE TRYING TO RUIN HIS BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF RACIAL HARMONY.
GOVERNOR TOM CORBETT'S CAMPAIGN GOES ON THE DEFENSE AFTER ACCUSATIONS IT PHOTOSHOPED AN IMAGE ON CORBETT'S WEBSITE TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE DIVERSE. THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN SMILING THERE IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE GROUP IS A STOCK IMAGE ADDED BY THE CAMPAIGN. THE WEB SITE BuzzFeed WAS FIRST TO REPORT THIS.
Stephen: LEAVE IT TO BuzzFeed BUZZ KILLS TO BLOW SOMETHING OUT OF PHOTOSHOPPED PROPORTION. CORBETT DID THIS WOMAN A FAVOR. BEFORE HE PASTED HER   INTO HIS VERY OWN RAINBOW COALITION, SHE WAS OVER ON SHUTTERSTOCK STUCK IN A BORING MEETING WITH A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. C'MON, NO RETIREMENT PLAN IS THAT MUCH FUN. FORTUNATELY, THE CORBETT CAMPAIGN ISN'T BACKING DOWN.
THE CORBETT CAMPAIGN RESPONDED BY SAYING THE ENTIRE IMAGE IS PHOTOSHOPPED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE CORBETT WAS TALKING WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE. ALL WEBSITES USE GRAPHICS. THE GRAPHIC REPRESENTS GOVERNOR CORBETT'S WIDESPREAD SUPPORT ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA.
Stephen: SEE? THEY'RE NOT PRETENDING BLACK WOMEN LIKE HIM. THEY'RE PRETENDING ANYONE LIKES HIM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE LOVE YOU TOM! AND THEY'RE BEING MODEST HERE. AS LONG AS THEY'RE PHOTOSHOPING IN SUPPORTERS, THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF IMPORTANT PENNSYLVANIA CONSTITUENTS THEY LEFT OUT, LIKE THE AMISH, PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL, THE PHILLY FANATIC, AND BEN FRANKLIN HUMPING A CHEESE STEAK. FOR THAT MATTER, I'M SURE CORBETT WOULD BEAT TOM WOLF IF HE LOST THE BLACK WOMAN AND ADDED TOM WOLF. POINT IS, SOMETIMES TO APPEAL TO A DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHIC, REALITY NEEDS A LITTLE BOOST. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MY AUDIENCE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
