Stephen: TONIGHT HARSH  PUNISHMENT FOR BIG BANKS. THAT SLAP ON THE WRIST COULD  KNOCK OFF THEIR CUFF LINKS. HOW TOLL KEEP THE SPARK IN YOUR  MARRIAGE? TRY A DATE NIGHT OR ANY DRIED  FRUIT REALLY. AND MY GUEST TOM BROKAW IS HERE  TO TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  SECOND TERM. I'LL ASK HIM IF THERE'S ANY WAY  TO AVOID A THIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] A SHOP IS CHARGING A FEE FOR  LIBERAL CUSTOMERS. THAT HAS TO STING FOR UTAH'S  LIBERAL. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT. ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  BROADCAST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. AS YOU CAN SEE, FOLKS I'M ON TOP  OF THE WORLD TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE OF THE STUDY I READ THAT  FORCING A SMILE GENUINELY MAKES  YOU HAPPIER. I HAVE TO SAY, THIS STUDY MAKES  SENSE. THAT JOKER GUY SEEMS REALLY  CHIPPER. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS GREAT NEWS. I'M JUST SO SAD I DIDN'T KNOW IT  BEFORE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN  THE NEWS TONIGHT. OKAY. CHECKING THE WEB HERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED 23 GUN  CONTROL MEASURES TODAY AND  CALLED ON CONGRESS TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND 100 ROUND  MAGAZINES. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE GOES MY FISHING TRIP,  OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] MORE ON THAT TOMORROW. WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE HERE? THE SYSTEM OF BOEING 787  DREAMLINER CAN APPARENTLY BURST  INTO FLAMES. THEY DON'T KNOW WHY. THAT'S FUN. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, IT HAS BEEN REVEALED THAT  OUR NEW FRIEND EGYPTIAN MOHAMMED  MORSI ONCE CALLED JEWS BLOOD SUCKERS AS WELL AS THE  DESCENDANTS OF APES AND PIGS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT TAKES ALL KINDS. LET'S SEE HERE, ACCORDING TO A  STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL  OF HEALTH PSYCHOLOGIST PEOPLE WHO SUPPRESS THEIR ANGER DIE  YOUNGER THAN PEOPLE WHO DON'T. THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE TO SMILE  ANYMORE. NOW CAN I BE ANGRY AGAIN AND  THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY. WHO KNOW WHO I'M MOST HAPPY TO  BE ANGRY AT, FOLKS? THE PEOPLE ANGRY AT OUR BANKS. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS  THIS WAY.
EVERYONE GOES THE EVIL BANKS. IT'S TIME TO STOP DEMONIZING  BANKS.
Stephen: YES, STOP  DEMONIZING THE BANKS. THEY'VE NOT DESTROYED THE  WORLD'S ECONOMY FOR OVER FOUR  YEARS. THE ATTACKS KEEP COMING. HSBC TARGETED BAY JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT WITCH HUNT OVER A FEW  MINOR INFRACTIONS.
HSBC ADMITTED TODAY THAT IT  COVERED UP ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS  FOR BURMA, IRAN, SUDAN, CUBA AND  LIBYA. THOSE NATIONS WERE UNDER BANKING  SANCTIONS BECAUSE OF HUMAN  RIGHTS ATROCITIES, TERRORISM OR IN IRAN'S CASE, A NUCLEAR  PROGRAM.
Stephen: BIG DEAL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT LIKE HSBC WAS THE ONE  ENRICHING PLUTONIUM, THEY WERE  JUST ENRICHING THEMSELVES. THERE'S JUST ONE OTHER THING.
IT LAUNDERED MORE THAN $800  MILLION FOR MEXICAN DRUG  CARTELS.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S. DOLLARS DAILY DEPOSITED TO HSBC  MEXICO USING BOXES SPECIALLY  MADE TO FIT THROUGH TELLERS WINDOWS TO SPEED TRANSACTIONS.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT HOW WAS  HSBC SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE BIG  SPECIALLY MADE BOXES THE CARTELS WERE DROPPING OFF WERE FULL OF  DRUG MONEY? THEY COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY  BEEN FILLED WITH HUMAN HEADS. [ LAUGHTER ] TURNS OUT IT WAS DRUG MONEY AND  ONCE THEY WERE CAUGHT, HSBC WAS  SLAMMED WITH A $1.9 BILLION  FINE. $1.9 BILLION DOLLARS. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT  WOULD TAKE THEM TO EARN THAT  BACK? FOUR WEEKS. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, YOU COULD TAKE THE  SPECIAL K CHALLENGE TWICE! [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, JUST TO SHOW -- JUST SO  SHOW HOW SORRY THEY ARE FOR  FUNDING MURDER, HSBC HAS DECIDED TO PARTIALLY DEFER BONUS  COMPENSATION FOR SENIOR  OFFICIALS. OKAY? PARTIALLY DEFERRING THEIR  BONUSES. I THINK THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATES  THEIR PARTIAL HUMANITY. [ LAUGHTER ] I DID NOT KNOW THIS BUT  SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE LAUNDER  MONEY FOR DRUG CARTELS, THEY GO TO JAIL. BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  ISN'T GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE  AS ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL BREWER SAID HSBC WOULD ALMOST  CERTAINLY HAVE LOST ITS BANKING  LICENSE AND THE ENTIRE BANKING SYSTEM WOULD HAVE BEEN  DESTABILIZING. THAT WOULD BE LIKE THROWING THE  BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER. INCIDENTALLY IT'S YET TO BE  PROVEN THAT HSBC PROFITED IN ANY  WAY FROM BLACK MARKET BABY  DISPOSAL. THEY WERE JUST HEAVILY INVESTED  IN BATH WATER REMANY OFFAL. LAY OFF THE BANKS. HERE TO LAY ON THE BANKS IS  ROLLING STONE WRITER, EDITOR AND  AUTHOR OF ARTICLE "SECRETS AND LIES OF THE BAILOUT."  MATT THANKS FOR COMING. YOU WORK FOR "THE ROLLING STONE"  ONE MAGAZINE THAT STILL EXISTS. MATT, IS IT REALLY FAIR TO RAKE  HSBC OVER THE COALS FOR THE ONE  TIME EVENT THAT HAPPENED OVER A DECADE AGO?
DO YOU SEE THE MOVIE CONAIR? THEY LAUNDERED MONEY FOR  EVERYBODY IN THAT AIRPLANE. IT WAS TERRORISTS, DRUG DEALERS,  YOU KNOW, MASS MURDERERS.
Stephen: THAT'S CALLED  DIVERSIFYING YOUR INVESTMENTS,  MATT. THAT'S WHAT BANKS ARE SUPPOSED  TO DO.
I GUESS SO AND THEY DID IT  VERY WELL.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK  SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HSBC?
I THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE  GONE TO JAIL FOR STARTERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THERE ARE A FEW RIGHT NOW THAT  SOMEBODY IN NIGHT COURT IN NEW  YORK CITY WILL GET A TOUGHER FINE FOR PEEING IN AN ALLEY THAN  ANYBODY GOT AT HSBC FOR  LAUNDERING MONEY FOR DRUG  CARTELS.
Stephen: BUT IF THEY PEED  IN 800 ALLEYS THEY  WOULDN'T  HAVE THROWN THEM IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE DESTABILIZED THE  URINE MARKET. THESE BANKS ARE CHAFTIZED NOW?
THEY ARE BIGGER, MORE COMPLEX  AND HARDER TO REGULATE. THIS WITH HSBC AND UBS WHICH GOT  A SIMILAR SETTLEMENT LATER IT'S  BEEN SHOWN WE CAN'T THROW THEM IN JAIL, ANY OF THEM BECAUSE  THEY ARE TOO IMPORTANT AS PEOPLE  TO PUT THEM IN JAIL.
Stephen: SO THEY ARE LIKE  007 LICENSED TO KILL OUR  ECONOMY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU FAMOUSLY  CALLED GOLDMAN SACHS A GREAT  VAMPIRE SQUID WRAPPED AROUND THE FACE OF HUMANITY.
YES.
Stephen: SO YOU ARE AN  OBJECTIVE JOURNALIST.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT MULLET WOULD  YOU COMPARE TO HSBC.
WHEN I SAID THAT ABOUT  GOLDMAN I GOT FLACK FROM  ZOOLOGISTS WHO SAID I WAS SLANDERING THAT PARTICULAR  ANIMAL. I'M GOING LAY OFF ANY MOLLUSK.
Stephen: OKAY. FINE. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH  SUPERWEALTHY PEOPLE OR  ORGANIZATIONS BEING ABLE TO BUY THEMSELVES OUT OF TROUBLE? I MEAN, OUR NATION NEEDS CASH.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT, YOU  KNOW, WHEN THE RULE OF LAW  DOESN'T AEMPLOY IF EVERYBODY, THEN YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE  THE -- APPLY TO EVERYBODY, THEN  YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE THE RULE OF LAW ANYMORE. IF WE CAN'T ARREST THESE PEOPLE  BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO IMPORTANT  WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO SOMEBODY CARRYING A JOINT.
Stephen: AGAIN, YOU SHOULD  BE CARRYING 800 MILLION JOINTS. WHY NOT LAY BACK AND ENJOY IT  BECAUSE WE NEED THE BANKS? RIGHT? WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT THE BANKS. MAYBE IT IS RIGHT. MAYBE WE'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT  WHERE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO  THESE GUYS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. YOU GET A PAYCHECK. DO YOU USE A BANK?
I DO USE A BANK. I DON'T USE THE MATTRESS  ANYMORE.
Stephen: SOUR A HYPOCRITE. [ LAUGHTER ] -- SO YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE?
EXACTLY. THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THEY MADE. ALL THE FINANCIAL COMPANIES HAVE  ESSENTIALLY MADE THIS ARGUMENT  THAT WE'RE TOOL IMPERATIVE TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM  THEREFORE WE CAN'T BE PROSECUTED  ANYMORE.
Stephen: NOT ONLY THAT BUT  IF THE BANKS WENT OUT OF  BUSINESS, I WOULD HAVE TO --
WHERE WOULD YOU GET YOUR  DRUGS. THAT'S RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: MATT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO
