( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW-- AND I HOPE YOU DO-- AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I LOVE SAYING, IT'S "I TOLD YOU SO." OH, GOD, THAT FELT GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) SEE, I TOLD YOU SO. OH! THERE IT IS AGAIN! WHAT A RUSH. AND, FOLKS, TODAY THE YOU I'M SO TELLING IS BARACK OBAMA. YOU SEE, FOR YEARS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DRAGGING HIS FEET ON BUILDING THE KEYSTONE X-L PIPELINE WHICH WOULD DRASTICALLY INCREASE OUR NATION'S SUPPLY OF OIL AS WELL AS OUR NATION'S SUPPLY OF PIPE. [LAUGHTER] NOW, FOR A WHILE OBAMA INSISTED HE COULDN'T COMPLETE THE PROJECT BECAUSE THE NATION'S BEST PIPE FITTERS WERE BUSY SAVING PRINCESS PEACH. THEN HE CLAIMED HE COULDN'T APPROVE ANYTHING UNTIL HE GOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. WELL LAST WEEK HIS STRATEGIC EXCUSE RESERVE RAN DRY.  MAJOR ADVANCEMENTS FOR THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. THE STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUING AN 11 VOLUME REPORT.  THEY FOUND THE PIPELINE WOULDN'T HURT THE ENVIRONMENT LIKE PROPONENTS CLAIM.
THE PIPELINE WILL ONLY HAVE A MINIMUM IMPACT ON CARBON EMISSIONS.
Stephen:  MINIMUM IMPACT. BOTTOM LINE, THE PIPELINE WILL PROVIDE US WITH MUCH NEEDED FOSSIL FUELS. SPEAKING OF FOSSILS, BILL O'REILLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE WATCHING, BUT ON SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, BILL SAT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DID WHAT THE BRONCOS COULDN'T-- HE SCORED POINTS. ( LAUGHTER ) JIM.
ALL RIGHT, KEYSTONE PIPELINE, NEW STUDY COMES IN, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT NEGLIGIBLE. 42,000 JOBS. YOU'RE GOING TO OKAY IT, I ASSUME.
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT 42,000. THAT'S NOT CORRECT. IT'S A COUPLE OF THOUSAND TO BUILD THE PIPELINE.
42 ALL TOLD.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE PROCESS NOW GOES--  AGENCIES COMMENT ON WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT DID, THE PUBLIC IS ALLOWED TO COMMENT, KERRY'S GOING TO GIVE ME A RECOMMENDATION --
SO I ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS.
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
OKAY, I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  YOU HEARD PRESIDENT O'REILLY. HE SAID YES TO THE KEYSTONE X-L PIPELINE, THAT'S WHY I LOVE BILL. HE'S NOT ONLY ASKING THE HARD-HITTING QUESTIONS. HE'S PROVIDING THE HARD-HITTING ANSWERS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND PAPA BEAR IS RIGHT, FOLKS THE PRESIDENT'S OWN STUDY SAYS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT IS NEGLIGIBLE, BECAUSE MOST OF ALBERTA'S OIL WILL LIKELY FIND A WAY TO GET TO MARKET ANYWAY, IF NOT BY PIPELINE, THEN BY RAIL. IT IS INEVITABLE. IF SOMETHING IS INEVITABLE, THEN AMERICA SHOULD BE THE ONE TO DO IT.  ( APPLAUSE ) CASE IN POINT-- THESE PEOPLE GET IT-- CASE IN POINT, ISN'T IT INEVITABLE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO MELT THE ICE CAPS SO I SAY WE DROWN THE POLAR BEARS IN THE SAN DIEGO ZOO. WE CHARGE PEOPLE A COUPLE OF BUCKS A HEAD TO WATCH AND GIVE THE MONEY TO THE WORLD WILDLIFE FUND AND THEY CAN USE IT TO SAVE THE POLAR BEARS. OTHERWISE, THOSE GUYS ARE DOOMED. NOW, NATION, THE OPENING CEREMONIES FOR THE 2014 WINTER OLYMPICS ARE JUST ONE DAY AWAY, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS THE SILVER MEDAL OF THEM STARTING TODAY. IN THE RUN-UP TO THESE GAMES, VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF CRITICISM FOR ANTIGAY LAWS, FOR BULL DOZING POOR NEIGHBORHOODS TO BUILD OLYMPIC FACILITIES AND NOW HARSHEST OF ALL FOR HIS YOGURT BLOCKADE.
THERE IS AN ATTEMPT AT SOME YOGURT DIPLOMACY. YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT, YOU SEE RUSSIA IS APPARENTLY HOLDING UP 5,000 SINGLE-SERVE CONTAINERS OF CHOBANI YOGURT. IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE U.S. ATHLETES IN SOCHI, BUT NEW YORK SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS IT'S STRANDED AT NEWARK'S LIBERTY AIRPORT.
Stephen:  OUR ATHLETES' YOGURT IS BEING EMBARGOED BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS WANT TO PROTECT TRADITIONAL FAMILY VALUES. CAUSE LET'S FACE IT-- IT'S NO SECRET THAT YOGURT IS THE GAYEST DAIRY PRODUCT. ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GREEK STYLE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT LONGS TO BE IN THE MOUTH OF JOHN STAMOS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND-- AND--   ( CHEERS ) HEAR ME OUT. HEAR ME OUT. NEED I MENTION, FRUIT ON THE BOTTOM. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, EVERYBODY KNOWS, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I HAVE OWNED THE WINTER OLYMPICS EVER SINCE I SAVED VANCOUVER IN 2010 BY BAILING OUT THE U.S. SPEEDSKATING TEAM WITH MY YOUR MONEY. FOLKS, I CANNOT WAIT TO GET TO SOCHI. ALTHOUGH, I MIGHT HAVE TO.
NEW CONCERNS THAT SOCHI IS NOT READY TO HOST THE GAMES.
HOTELS AND OTHER BUILDINGS AREN'T FINISHED.
JOURNALISTS ARE APPALLED BY THE CONDITION OF THEIR HOTEL ROOMS, MANY OF THEM IN SHAMBLES.
THE ROOMS-- SPARTAN IS A NICE WAY TO CALL THEM.
STACY ST. CLAIR OF THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE, TWEETED THIS OUT:
Stephen:  LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SHE'S COMPLAINING THAT HER HOTEL SHUT OFF THE FACE-POISON VALVE? I'M SORRY, THAT'S JUST SEEING THE GLASS OF TOXIC YELLOW FLUID AS HALF EMPTY. [LAUGHTER] AND THESE REPORTERS' IVY TOWER ATTITUDES EXTEND TO THE PORCELAIN THRONE.
NOTICE THE SIGN HERE ASKING USERS NOT TO FLUSH TOILET PAPER, INSTEAD THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO THROW IT IN THE TRASH CAN.
Stephen:  OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGH, THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGH. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE SECRET POLICE PROBABLY WON'T GO THROUGH YOUR TRASH NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) JIMMY, WHAT'S THE NEXT EVENT IN THE CRY-ATHALON.
EVEN AS THE CITY SIDEWALKS BEGIN TO FILL WITH ATHLETES AND TOURISTS, SOME OF THOSE SIDEWALKS HAVE YET TO BE PAVED.
NOT ALL THE MANHOLES ARE COVERED.
Stephen:  OKAY, THAT ONE SURPRISES ME. I MEAN, GIVEN THE ANTIGAY LAWS, YOU WOULD EXPECT PUTIN TO COVER THE MANHOLES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M SORRY. I'LL TELL YOU, FOLKS, THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE ALL THIS NIT-PICKING BY THE COMPLAIN-STREAM MEDIA.
A GERMAN REPORTER SAID WHEN HE CHECKED INTO HIS HOTEL ROOM, THERE WAS A STRAY DOG LIVING INSIDE.
Stephen:  LOOK, DO YOU WANT YOUR TOILET FIXED OR NOT? IT'S A BUSY WEEK, AND THE HOTEL ONLY HAS ONE REPAIR DOG. THE POINT IS, ALL THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED. SOCHI STILL HAS ALMOST NINE HOURS BEFORE THE OLYMPICS BEGIN. BESIDES, I'VE SEEN WAY WORSE, FOLKS. YOU WANNA TALK BATHROOM NIGHTMARE? WHEN I WAS IN VANCOUVER, THE HOTEL GAVE ME MINI BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, BUT NO LOTION. I HAD TO USE CONDITIONER ON MY SKIN. AND LET ME TELL YOU, FOUR YEARS LATER, YOU'D BE ALARMED BY THE PARTS OF MY BODY THAT ARE STILL TANGLE-FREE.  IF I CAN TOUGH IT OUT, SOCHI REPORTERS, YOU CAN TOUGH IT OUT. WHAT'S THIS? I'VE JUST BEEN HANDING A BREAKING NEWS BULLETIN FROM MYSELF THAT SAYS I WILL NOT BE ATTENDING THE SOCHI OLYMPICS. DAMN IT!
THAT'S TOO BAD, FOLKS. I HEAR THEY'D ALMOST FINISHED THE RUNWAY. MY PLANE WAS SUPPOSED TO CRASH ON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
