THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. WE'RE ONLY 19 DAYS AWAY FROM  THE ELECTION. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  HOLLYWOOD ALLIES ARE ALREADY  TRYING TO STEAL IT. HE'S BEEN ENDORSED BY  EVERYONE FROM GEORGE CLOONEY  TO NEIL PATRICK HARRIS, TO  BEYONCE AND JAY-Z TO  LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, ELLEN DEGENERES AND STEPHEN DE  SPIELBERG. IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE OF  DANCING WITH THE STARS BUT  WITH STARS. AND SO FAR, SO FAR, FOLKS,  MY MAN MITT JUST HAS CLINT  EASTWOOD, DONNIE AND MARIE  OS BOND, THE LADY FROM NORTHERN EXPOSURE AND I WANT  TO SAY JOY BEHAR'S OLDER  SISTER. (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS WHO THAT IS. BUT NOW MITT HAS PICKED UP  THE BIGGEST ENDORSEMENT OF  ALL.
THERE IS A SQUIRREL IN  SOUTH CAROLINA WHO FOLKS SAY  CAN PICK PRESIDENTIAL  WINNERS. FOUR YEARS AGO THEY SET UP  TWO BOWLS OF NUTS. AN OBAMA BOWL AN McCAIN  BOWL. HE PREFERRED THE OBAMA NUTS  AND THIS YEAR HE FAVORS  ROMNEY NUTS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THERE IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, GET USED TO THE TERM  PRESIDENT ROMNEY. HMMMM, HMMMM. OH THAT LEAVES A REAL TASTE  IN YOUR MOUTH. WHAT IS THAT? I THINK THAT'S-- THAT'S  ROMNEY NUTS.

ON DAY ONE I WILL LABEL  CHINA A CURRENCY  MANIPULATER.
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU IF  I'M PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE  WE'RE GOING TO GET AT  APPROVAL FROM THAT PIPELINE FROM CANADA.
I WILL ON DAY ONE PUT A  HALT TO ALL THE REGULATIONS  THAT WERE PUT IN DURING THE  OBAMA YEARS.
Stephen: WOW! THE DRIVE AND AMBITION. I MEAN THOSE ARE THE  QUALITIES OF A REAL LEADER. OR A SERIOUS TWEAKER. (LAUGHTER)  EITHER WAY, M ITT IS GOING  TO KEEP THOSE PROMISES, I  KNOW.

GOING TO BE EXCITING. GET USED TO IT THESE DAYS IT  SEEMS LIKE WE MAKE  EVERYTHING OUT OF CORN. FROM CAR TIRES, DRYWALL, TO  KNIVES AND FORKS TO, AND I  AM NOT MAKING THIS UP,  POPCORN. WE REALLY ARE LIVING IN THE  FUTURE. WHERE'S MY JET PACK? NOW UNFORTUNATELY, THIS  YEAR'S CRIPPLING DROUGHT HAS  DRIVEN CORN PRICES THROUGH  THE ROOF. FROM 3.25 A BUSHEL THREE  YEARS AGO TO 7:35 A BUSHEL  TODAY. 7:35 A BUSHEL. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW  MUCH THAT IS? BECAUSE I DON'T. WHAT'S A BUSHEL? I THOUGHT A BUSHEL WAS A  GROUP OF DECEMBER. AND NOW, FOLKS, THIS  SHORTAGE IS FORCING AMERICAN  CATTLE FARMERS TO THINK  OUTSIDE THE BOX THEY PACK THEIR COWS IN. JIM?
AT MAYFIELD UNITED  LIVESTOCK COMMODITIES OWNER  JOSEPH WATSON IS TWEAKING  THE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS. HIS 1400 CATTLE ARE NO  LONGER FEEDING OFF CORN. THE PRICE HE SAID ARE TOO  HIGH TO KEEP IN STOCK. SO EARLIER THIS YEAR HE  BEGAN TO BUY SECONDHAND  CANDY.
IT HAS A HIGHER RATIO OF  FATS AND ACTUALLY FEEDING  STRAIGHT CORN.
Stephen: YES, THIS CATTLE  FARMER IS NOW A JOLLY  RANCHER. AND FOLKS, I SAY-- I SAY IT  IS HIGH TIME-- IT IS HIGH  TIME WE STARTED FEEDING OUR  COWS CANDY. I MEAN THE MEXICANS HAVE  BEEN STUFFING THEIR DONKEYS  FULL OF SWEETS FOR YEARS. NOW NATION, WE HAVE ALWAYS  BEEN TOLD WE ARE WHAT WE  EAT. BUT NOW WE CAN EAT WHAT EATS  WHAT WE EAT. IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE. BEST OF ALL--   (APPLAUSE)  BEST OF ALL EVEN THOUGH THIS  FARMER IS GIVING HIS COWS  CANDY, HE STILL TECHNICALLY IS FEEDING THEM CORN. BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF IT IS  MADE FROM HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN  SYRUP WHICH THANKS TO  GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES IS SOMEHOW CHEAPER THAN THE  CORN IT IS MADE FROM. WHAT DELICIOUS IRONY. DELICIOUS, BECAUSE OF THAT  CORN SIRRUP. BUT SADLY, FOLKS THIS  DROUGHT AFFECTS MORE THAN  JUST MY FILLET MIN NOUGAT T  IS ALSO THREATENING A  NATIONAL PRESSURE-- TREASURE. JIM?
CORN, IT'S AS AMERICAN AS  APPLE PIE. AND THANKS TO HIGH FRUCTOSE  CORN SYRUP T IS APPLE PIE. CORN IS SO AMERICAN, THAT  THERE IS A MONUMENT TO IT. THE CORN PALACE IN MITCHELL,  SOUTH DAKOTA. PALACE DIRECTOR MARK  SHELLING.
THE CORN PALACE ATTRACTS  A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE PER  YEAR. THIS IS THE BIGGEST MONUMENT  TO CORN THAT WE HAVE IN THE  ENTIRE WORLD.
NOT ONLY IS THE BIGGEST,  IT'S ALSO THE ONLIEST. PEOPLE DRIVE FROM PRESUMABLY  ELSEWHERE TO SEE THE MURR  ALLS MADE OF 12 DIFFERENT  COLORS OF CORN.
SINCE 1892 WE HAVE BEEN  REDECORATING THE CORN PALACE  WITH A NEW THEME EACH YEAR. PEOPLE REALLY CANNOT BELIEVE  THAT THE MURR ALLS ARE MADE  OUT OF CORN UNTIL THEY  EXPERIENCE IT AND SEE IT FOR  THEMSELVES. AND THEY START SAYING, THAT  IS AN EAR OF CORN, WOW, THIS  IS TRULY AMAZING.
BUT A DROUGHT IN THE  HEARTLAND HAS THREATENED  THIS ANNUAL TRADITION. THE WORLD'S ONLY CORN PALACE  HAS BROUGHT IN TOURISTS TO  MITCHELL FOR A NUMBER OF  DECADES. THE DROUGHT THIS YEAR MAY  TAKE ITS TOLL ON THE CORN  USED TO MAKE THOSE MURR  ALLS.
BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT,  FOUR OF THE COLORS THAT WE  WOULD TYPICALLY USE IN OUR  MURR ALL DESIGNS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR US  THIS YEAR.
WE'VE SEEN THE CRUSHED  FARMING COMMUNITIES. WE'VE BEEN WARNED ABOUT  RISING FOOD AND FUEL PRICES. BUT NO ONE PREPARED US FOR  LESS VIBRANT CORN MURR ALLS. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT,"  SPECIAL REPORT. A SCHUKING DISASTER. NICE MAYOR AT THE MITCHELL  CORN PALACE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE CORN PALACE WAS BUILT IN  1892. THE COMMUNITY LEADERS WERE  LOOKING FOR A WAY TO MAKE  MITCHELL UNIQUE. WHAT'S GOING TO PUT MITCHELL  ON THE MAP. SO THEY SAID WE WANT A  PALACE MADE OF CORN.
AND IT WORKED. AS ANYONE WOULD AGREE,  MITCHELL SOUTH DAKOTA IS  CERTAINLY ON A MAP. TODAY THE CORN PALACE STANDS  AS A PROUD REMINDER OF JUST  HOW AMAZING CORN IS.
CORN IS AMAZING. IF YOU GET THE PUN THERE.
WHAT?
THE CORN --
WHAT IS THE PUN?
MAZE.
YES.
MAZE IS THE ANCIENT WORD  FOR CORN.
I'M SORRY, I DON'T SPEAK  ANCIENT, SORRY. WHAT IS THAT?
THE CORN-- CORN THAT WE  HAVE IN AMERICA WAS  CONSIDERED MAZE BY THE  NATIVE AMERICANS.
RIGHT.
SO THEN WE OFTEN USE THE  THEME IT'S A-MAZING. OUR CORN PALACE IS AMAZING  BECAUSE IT'S DECORATED WITH  THE CORN AND THE MAZE. AND THEN WE SPELL IT WITH  THE MAIZ, RATHER THAN MAZE.
I'M SORRY, I'M NOT  EXACTLY FOLLOWING.
IT'S A PUN.
ANYWAY, CORN IS AMAZING.
AND THIS YEAR'S MURR ALLS  WERE DESIGNED BY LOCAL  AVANT-COULD BE ARTIST SHERRY  RAMSDALE.
CORN ART IS A RATHER  COMPLEX PROCESS. SOME OF THE ARTISTS I DRAW  INSPIRATION FROM ARE A  COUPLE OF THE MASTER,  OBVIOUSLY LEONARDO DA VINCI,  MICHELANGELO.
HER VISION IS THEN  BROUGHT TO LIFE BY  PROFESSIONAL CORN HANGER DAN  McLEOD.
I HAVE BEEN HANGING CORN  ON THE CORN PALACE FOR OVER  TEN YEARS.
AND CORN HANGING ISN'T  JUST AN ART, IT'S A SCIENCE.
WHEN I'M GOING TO TRY TO  EXPLAIN IS I THINK IT'S THE  SCIENCE PART OF IT. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE, AND IT'S  A PART OF THE ART TOO. I MEAN IT'S ALL MIXED  TOGETHER IN ONE BUNCH.
IF YOU DON'T DO IT RIGHT  IT WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH. YEAH, THE IMPRINT WOULD BE  THERE BUT IT WOULDN'T STAND  OUT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO  SAY, AND COME ALIVE.
BUT THIS YEAR MARK  RECEIVED THE PHONE CALL THAT  EVERY CORN PALACE DIRECTOR  DREADS.
THE FOUR COLORS THAT WE  WILL NOT HAVE THIS YEAR ARE  ORANGE VAR GATED, BLUE, CALL  I COAND LIGHT BROWN --
MOST DEVASTATING COLOR  THAT I LOST WAS BLUE. BECAUSE IT DOMINATED A LOT  OF THE SKY, A LOT OF THE  AREA OF THE MURR ALLS.
AFTER A CENTURY OF  TRADITION, MITCHELL WAS IN A  CORN HOLE.
I KIND OF HAD A PIT IN MY  STOMACH AND THOUGHT NOW  WHAT.
SO WHAT?
WELL, THEY HAVE THE  CHOICE EITHER TO LEAVE THE  OLD MURR ALLS UP FOR ANOTHER  YEAR OR FOR ME TO REDESIGN THE MURR ALLS WITH THE  COLORS THAT THEY THOUGHT  WOULD BE AVAILABLE.
WHAT CAN WE DO? WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING.
WITHOUT A COLONEL OF HOPE  MARK MADE A GAME CHANGING  DECISION.
WE DECIDED TO MOVE  FORWARD WAY CORN MURR ALLS  BUT INSTEAD OF USING THE  NORMAL 12 COLORS THAT WE HAVE, WE WILL BE USING  EIGHT.
A BOLD BUT NECESSARY  MOVE. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST  MITCHELL'S CORN PALACE, THIS  IS AMERICA'S CORN PALACE.
IT'S HARD TO ENVISION THE  UNITED STATES WITHOUT A CORN  PALACE. BUT IF IT WERE TO GO AWAY I  THINK WE WOULD LOSE ONE OF  AMERICA'S GREAT ICONS,  LANDMARKS. AND EVERY TIME YOU LOSE ONE  OF THOSE AMERICAN TRADITIONS,  IT JUST HURTS MORE AND MORE.
THE BIGGEST THING THAT I  HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHEN I TALK  TO THEM IS THEY'LL GO I  NEVER KNEW ANYTHING LIKE THIS EXISTED. YOU KNOW, IT'S AWESOME.
OR IN OTHER WORDS,  IRRESISTABLE. GET IT?
YEAH.
IT'S LIKE YOUR PUN.
A-MAIZE.
BUT AS IN EAR OF CORN.
WE'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.
YOU HAVE.
A LOT OF TIMES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE'S JUST  GOING THROW AWAY THE OLD  CORN WHEN THEY TAKE IT DOWN AT THE END OF THE SEASON, I  KNOW SOME DIABETIC COWS THAT  COULD REALLY USE THE
