[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  THEN YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE NEVER  BEEN A BIG FAN OF INFORMATION. SCIENTISTS SAY WE USE ONLY 10%  OF OUR BRAIN, BUT I SAY STOP  THROWING ALL THOSE NUMBERS AT  ME. WORST OF ALL, THE NOSY PARKERS  OVER AT THE CENSUS BUREAU ARE  ALWAYS COLLECTING DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE AND  BUSINESSES. SO I WAS EXCITED TO LEARN THAT  FINALLY SOMEONE IS TRYING TO  STOP IT.
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JEFF  DUNCAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA  PROPOSED A BILL TO FORBID THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU FROM  CONDUCTING ANY SURVEY EXCEPT FOR  A POPULATION COUNT.
HEAR THAT, CENSUS BUREAU? POPULATION COUNT ONLY. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MY PERSONAL  INFORMATION. THAT BELONGS TO FACEBOOK! [LAUGHTER] JEFF DUNCAN KNOWS THIS IS REALLY  A PRIVATE PRIVACY ISSUE,  EXPLAINING RIGHT NOW THE CENSUS BUREAU CAN ASK CITIZENS VERY  INVASIVE QUESTIONS. IF THEY DON'T RESPOND, THE  GOVERNMENT SHOWS UP AT THEIR  DOOR AND THREATENS THEM WITH A  FINE. AMERICANS ARE FED UP WITH THESE  MANDATORY CENSUS BUREAUS AND  THEY'RE ASKING US TO STOP THE  HARASSMENT. YES! STOP THE CENSUS BUREAU  HARASSMENT. EVERY FEW YEARS THEY SHOW UP ON  OUR FRONT PORCH ASKING FOR  PERSONAL INFORMATION. IT'S LIKE A DRUNK EX-BOYFRIEND. SUZANNE, WHO'S THE NEW GUY  YOU'RE DATING? WHAT'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF  EDUCATION HE'S COMPLETED OR IS  HE PACIFIC ISLANDER OR OTHER? FOLKS, THE GOVERNMENT, THE  GOVERNMENT, LISTEN TO THIS, THE  GOVERNMENT SAYS CENSUS INFORMATION IS NECESSARY FOR  DISTRIBUTING GOVERNMENT  SERVICES, BUT THE REAL PLANS FOR THIS INFORMATION ARE ANYBODY'S  GUESS. OR EVERYBODY'S GUESS. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO REPORTS  PUBLISHED IN THE HIGHLY  PRESTIGIOUS "THE INTERNET," CENSUS DATA COULD VERY WELL BE  USED TO MAKE A DATABASE OF GUN  OWNERS FOR CONFISCATION OR THE DIRECT U.N. TROOPS WHERE TO KICK  IN YOUR DOOR OR FOR SOMETHING  EVEN MORE SINISTER, LIKE TRACKING THE CORN HARVEST. TERRIFYING. IT'S LIKE THAT HORROR MOVIE  "AGGREGATE YIELD OF THE CHILDREN  OF THE CORN."  BESIDES... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BESIDES, WE DON'T NEED TO COUNT  CORN. I'M PRETTY SURE AT THIS POINT  MONSANTO HAS GENETICALLY  ENGINEERED CORN SO MUCH IT CAN COUNT ITSELF. BUT SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE  NOT SO THRILLED ABOUT DEFEATING  THE INFO-NAZIS.
IMAGINE IF SUDDENLY THESE  NUMBERS DISAPPEARED.
NO UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, NO GDP  NUMBERS, NO ECONOMIC DATA AT  ALL.
THIS WOULD MAKE IT ALMOST  IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY IMPORTANT  ECONOMIC INDICATORS.
THIS IS HOW WE GET ALL  ECONOMIC DATA THAT ALL MARKET  INDICATORS RELY ON.
MARKET INDICATORS? COME ON. WALL STREET DOESN'T RUN ON  CENSUS DATA. IT RUNS ON SOMETHING MUCH MORE  POWERFUL -- COCAINE. BESIDES, CONGRESSMAN DUNCAN IS  IN FAVOR OF SOME INFORMATION,  SAYING, "AS A FORMER SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I RECOGNIZE THAT  SOME ECONOMIC DATA GATHERING IS  BENEFICIAL, HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE VOLUNTARY, INDUSTRY-DRIVEN  AND NOT MANDATED BY THE  GOVERNMENT UNDER PENALTY OF LAW."  YES, THE FREE MARKET CAN HANDLE  IT. AND WE ALREADY HAVE WAY OF  DETERMINING THE UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE, THE NIELSEN RATINGS FOR "MAURY."  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE  COMPLETELY IGNORANT OF  EVERYTHING GOING ON WITHIN ITS  BORDERS. AFTER ALL, WHAT'S AN I.R.S. TAX  FORM BUT A WAGE CENSUS. UNDER HOUSEHOLD INCOME, I SHOULD  GET TO CHECK A BOX THAT READS,  "LET'S JUST SAY WE'RE COMFORTABLE."  I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT? SERIOUSLY. IF WE CROSS THIS LINE, IF WE  CROSS THIS RUBICON, WHAT IS  NEXT? TRACKING ALL VOTERS USING SOME  KIND OF STICKER? OH, MY GOD! THE POINT IS, THIS BILL MAY BE A  TACIT REJECTION OF THE AGE OF  ENLIGHTENMENT, BUT WHAT'S SO WRONG WITH THE AGE OF  ENDARKENMENT. MAY I REMIND YOU, IF THERE WAS  NO RENAISSANCE, THERE WOULD BE  NO RENAISSANCE FAIRS. NEW YORK I DON'T WANT A TURKEY  LEG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
