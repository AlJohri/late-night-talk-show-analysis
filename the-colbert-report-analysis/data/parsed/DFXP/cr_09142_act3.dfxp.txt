Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH TIMOTHY CARDINAL  DOLAN WHO HAS A NEW E-BOOK  CALLED "PRAYING IN ROME, REFLECTIONS ON THE CONCLAVE AND  ELECTING POPE FRANCIS."  I WAS JUST OVER IN ROME. AMAZING. ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T CARE FOR  WAS ST. PETERS BECAUSE IT WAS SO  CROWDED WITH PEOPLE HOPING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THIS NEW  POPE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK  THIS GUY IS DRAWING A CROWD?
WELL, HE'S DOWN TO EARTH,  HE'S SIMPLE, HE'S SINCERE. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. HE BECAUSE GREAT ARCHBISHOP OF  BUENOS AIRES, WHICH IS ONE OF  THE...
Stephen: BUT HE'S NOT  WEARING THE GOLD. HE'S NOT ON THE BIG GOLDEN  THRONE. WHEN I SEE HIM, I PUT MY BUCK IN  THE COLLECTION PLATE ON SUNDAY,  THAT'S FOR PRODUCTION VALUE. I WANT TO SEE LIKE AN "IRON MAN  3" PRODUCTION VALUE WHEN I GO  THERE.
WHATEVER HE IS OR IS NOT  WEARING, HE SURE SEEMS TO BE  DOING WELL POPULARITY WISE. HE'S MARKETING THE MESSAGE, AND  I USE MARKETING IN THE BEST  SENSE OF THE WORD. WE SAY EADVANTAGEIZATION, BUT  HE'S A PRO AT IT, ISN'T HE?
Stephen: MARKETING LIKE  MATTHEW, LUKE AND JOHN. OKAY, ANOTHER THING I GOT A  PROBLEM, WITH AND I HATE TO MAKE  YOU ANSWER FOR THE GUY YOU DID OR DID NOT VOTE FOR.
OKAY.
Stephen: BUT HE ALSO SAID  THAT HE WAS ASKED ABOUT  HOMOSEXUALITY AND SAID, WHO AM I TO JUDGE?
UH-HUH.
Stephen: YOU ARE THE POPE  TO JUDGE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO? WHAT IS DECLARATION OF SIN NOR  SIN EXCEPT A JERUSALEM?
NO, WELL, WE CAN NEVER JUDGE  PERSON, RIGHT? WE CAN JUDGE ACTION, BUT WE  CAN'T JUDGE PERSONS. JESUS TOLD US THAT. SO HE'S REPEATING THE TIMELESS  TEACHING OF THE BIBLE THAT WE  CAN NEVER JUDGE ANOTHER HUMAN  BEING. I CAN'T JUDGE BERNIE MADOFF. I DON'T LIKE WHAT HE DID. I CAN JUDGE THE ACTIONS. BUT I COULDN'T JUDGE HIS HEART  OR SOUL.
Stephen: BUT I'M A PUNDIT. IF I DON'T JUDGE ANYONE, I DON'T  GET A CHECK.
YOU GOT RATINGS TO TAKE CARE  OF, AND I HOPE I HELP. BUT HE'S NOT. HE LEAVES THAT UP TO THE LORD. THE LORD IS THE SUPREME JUDGE. I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO JUDGE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK  ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT  BENEDICT, CAN I STILL CALL HIM POPE BENEDICT.
SURE YOU CAN.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT POPE  BENEDICT AND POPE FRANCIS AT THE  SAME TIME. WE HAVE A SPARE POPE RIGHT NOW. POPE BENEDICT MADE YOU A  CARDINAL.
HE DID INDEED.
Stephen: HE MADE YOU A  CARDINAL. DO YOU THINK FRANCIS LOOKS AND  YOU AND GOES, YOU'RE ONE OF  BENNIE'S BOYS. NO, NO, NO, BACK OF THE  POPE-MOBILE FOR YOU.
WE ALL ARE. WE ALL ARE. HE HASN'T MADE ANY YET. SO I'D LIKE TO THINK HE'D SAY HE  WAS PART OF THE CONCLAVE THAT  ELECTED ME.
IS THIS THE FIRST CONCLAVE  YOU EVER WENT TO?
FIRST CONCLAVE EVER.
Stephen: AFTER FRANCIS IS  OUT, WHENEVER...
I HOPE IT'S A LONG TIME.
Stephen: I HOPE IT'S A LONG  TIME. I HOPE IT'S A RETIREMENT.
OKAY.
Stephen: WE GET SOMEBODY IN  THERE THAT I AM MORE SIMPATICO  WITH. IF YOU WERE TO BE MADE POPE,  WHAT NAME WOULD YOU CHOOSE? [APPLAUSE] STEPHEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN, WE'LL BE  RIGHT BACK.
