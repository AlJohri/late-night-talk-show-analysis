NO, I'VE ALWAYS DUG IT.
STEPHEN: DIG IT. DIG IT, DAD.
I HAVE A LOT OF FUN. IN KINDERGARTEN, I HAD A GOOD TIME TELLING ALL THE KIDS MY DAD WAS A ROCK STAR, AND NOWADAYS I'M A LITTLE MORE LOW KEY ABOUT IT.
STEPHEN: DID THEY BELIEVE YOU?
YEAH. IT REALLY STARTED HAPPENING WHEN I WOULD GO TO SCHOOL AND KIDS WOULD COME UP AND SAY, MY PARENTS REALLY LIKE YOUR DADDY'S MUSIC. AND ONCE, LIKE, ON THE PLAYGROUND, OTHER KIDS STARTED TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT. I WAS, LIKE, THIS IS PRETTY COOL.
STEPHEN: DO YOU THINK THE TWO OF YOU COULD TAKE BILLY RAY AND MILEY CYRUS IN A FIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT. NOT A CHANCE.
STEPHEN: NO? NO, I WOULDN'T WANT TO GET IN THAT.
STEPHEN: YEAH. (LAUGHTER) IS THIS A STRICT SORT OF BAND-MATE RELATIONSHIP, OR IS IT FATHER-SON -- DO YOU HAVE TO SAY, DON'T MAKE ME PULL THIS TOUR BUS OVER? COME BACK HERE, YOUNG MAN? (LAUGHTER)
NO, MY WIFE AND I ALWAYS JOKE THAT HE'S THE MOST MATURE PERSON IN THE FAMILY, AND THAT'S BECAUSE HE HAD BETTER PARENTS THAN WE DID. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NOW, ACCORDING TO ONE OF YOUR DAD'S SONGS, THE GIRLS REALLY GO FOR THE HEAVY METAL DRUMMERS, YOU KNOW, ON THE LANDING IN THE SUMMER. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT PLAYING HEAVY METAL?
WELL, NOT SO MUCH. I MEAN, I MIGHT BORROW A FEW DRUM TECHNIQUES FROM  THE HEAVY METAL WORLD BUT I'LL STICK TO FOLK IN OUR NICE LOW-KEY ROCK. I CAN'T USE "LOW KEY"
STEPHEN: THE NAME OF THE SONG TONIGHT IS LOW-KEY. WE'LL GET TO IT.
YOU SHOULD SHOW EVERYBODY THAT PICTURE OF HIM RIGHT THERE.
STEPHEN: THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PICTURE OF YOUR FATHER.
NOT THAT ONE.
STEPHEN: THERE WE GO. (LAUGHTER) IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE WEARING WHEN YOU MET HIS MOTHER?
PROBABLY. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WELL, SPENCER, JEFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BAND IS TWEEDY, THE ALBUM IS "SUKIERAE." WE'LL BE BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY TWEEDY. STICK AROUND
