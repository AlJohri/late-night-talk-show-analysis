Stephen:  TONIGHT, DO THE RICH HAVE IT BETTER THAN YOU? YES. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, INNOVATIONS IN THE CEREAL INDUSTRY. LUCKY CHARMS ARE NOW SCIENTIFICALLY DELICIOUS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MY GUEST IS U.S. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, ARNE DUNCAN. PAY ATTENTION-- MY INTERVIEW WILL BE ON THE TEST. ( LAUGHTER ) A NEW STUDY SAYS 85% OF USERS DON'T BECOME ADDICTED TO METH. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR VIEWERS OF "BREAKING BAD." THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  HEY! WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, SIT DOWN, WE GOTTA GET GOING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  I WANT TO WELCOME ALL THE PEOPLE WATCHING FROM THE UNITED STATES. ALSO I WANT TO THANK ANY OF OUR VIEWERS FROM ITALY WATCHING TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CIAO! FOLKS, I WISH I WERE AS HAPPY AS YOU ARE, BUT I'M AFRAID WE'RE LIVING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF OBAMASTAN. FOLKS, IT IS NOT SAFE TO BE RICH IN THIS COUNTRY ANYMORE. FRANK LEIBER I WOULD GIVE ALL MY FORTINES TO THE NEEDY BUT I DON'T WANT TO TURN SOME POOR PERSON INTO A TARGET. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, NO, NO, I'M AFRAID ALL THAT MONEY IS MY CROSS TO BEAR. IT'S A CROSS MADE OF SOLID GOLD. VERY NICE, ACTUALLY. WELL, DURING A SPEECH YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA HIT THE RICH WITH ANOTHER DRONE STRIKE IN THAT HE WAS BORING. JIM.
THE TRENDS THAT HAVE TAKEN HOLDS OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES OF A WINNER-TAKE-ALL ECONOMY. THOSE TRENDS HAVE BEEN MADE WORSE BY THE RECESSION. THE TOP 1% OF AMERICANS TOOK HOME 20% OF THE NATION'S INCOME LAST YEAR. MOST OF THE GAINS HAVE GONE TO THE TOP .01%.
Stephen:  THAT'S CLAR WARFARE, FOLKS. THE TOP .01%. HE'S PITTING THE UNATTAINABLY RICH TO THE UNIMAGINABLE RICH. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT BILLIONAIRES ARE FORCED TO GO TO SEPARATE SCHOOLED SCOOLZ, FLY ON THEIR OWN PLANES, AND OFTEN END UP BEHIND BARS. BUT NOW, SOME BILLIONAIRES ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND.
EVEN IF YOU HAVE $1 BILLION, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT ON THE FORBE 400 LIST. "FORBES" IS OUT THIS MORNING WITH ITS 32nd ANNUAL LIFT OF THE 400 WEALTHIEST AMERICANS. THIS YEAR THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER.
FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED TO HAVE $1.3 BILLION. THERE WERE 61 BILLION ARIZONA THAT WEREN'T EVEN RICH ENOUGH TO MAKE THE "FORBES" 400 THIS YEAR.
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW WHO TO FEEL WORSE FOR. THOSE POOR BILLIONAIRES OR "FORBES" MAGAZINE WHO JUST LOST SUBSCRIBES OF SCRIBERS PURPOSE FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT'S A SAD DAY TO BE A BILLIONAIRE. YOU TOIL YOUR WHOLE LIFE TO BUILD A MEANINGFUL LEGACY FOR YOUR FAMILY, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT BILLION DOLLARS YOU EARNED WAS WORTHLESS. EXCEPT FOR THE MONEY PART. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT PART'S WORTH $1 BILLION. WITH THAT IN MEEND, IT'S TIME TO REVISIT MY LUXURY SEGMENT FOR HIGH-NET-WORTH VIEWERS. THIS IS "COLBERT PLATINUM."  ♪  ♪ A QUICK REMINDER, FOLKS-- THIS SEGMENT IS FOR PLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY. SO IF YOU'RE NOT WATCHING THIS ON YOUR PROTOTYPE TONY START RETINAL PROJECTOR, WHY DON'T YOU SCAMPER OFF AND PLANT SOME SEEDS FOR FOOD? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE GONE. NOW, PLATINUM NATION, WE SUPER RICH SET OURSELVES APART HAVE A OUR EXQUISITE TASTE. WHEN IT COMES TO CARS, ANTIQUES, AND ELECTIVE OFFICE, WE BUY ONLY THE FINEST. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO LIQUOR. IF YOU'RE NOT DRINKING AN 1886 ABSINTHE FROM OSCAR WILDE'S PERSONAL COLLECTION, YOU MAY AS WELL BE DRINKING THE SWEAT OUT OF A HOBO'S ASS CRACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT HOW EXCLUSIVE IS YOUR SNIFTER OF LOUIS XIII IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE COOLED BY CUBES OF FROZEN TAP WATER-- A.K.A., POVERTY PUNCH. ( LAUGHTER ) LUXLY, THE HIGH-END GROWERS AT DEAN & DELUCA HAVE THE ANSWER. IT'S CALLED GLACE LUXURY ICE AT THE LUXURY PRICE OF $75 FOR JUST 10 CUBES, OPENER NOT CUBES-- TECHNICALLY ORBS INDIVIDUALLY CARVED FROM A 300-POUND BLOCK TO ENSURE FLAWLESS QUALITY. USING TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM FAMED AUSTRIAN SCULPTOR EIS KUB-TREI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD WORK, GOOD WORK. AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THIS ICE WON'T CONTAMINATE YOUR PREMIUM HOOCH, BECAUSE GLACE HAS A ZERO-TASTE PROFILE. I BELIEVE IT. WHEN YOU SPEND $75 FOR A BAG OF HANDCARVED ICE, THAT IS TOTALLY TASTELESS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND IT IS THE HEIGHT OF CONSPICUOUS-- FOLKS. IT IS THE HEIGHT OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION, BECAUSE AN HOUR LATER YOU'RE LITERALLY PISSING YOUR MONEY AWAY. FOLKS, I BELIEVE THAT INDIVIDUALLY CARVED ICE IS A START. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT, THE FLAVOR OF MY PREMIUM HIGH BALLS CAN STILL BE RUINED BY THE EXHALED CO2 OF NOT RICH PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO BE OFFERING THIS $200 BAG OF STEPHEN COLB-AIR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. YOU SEE, IT'S A PREMIUM MIXTURE OF GASES, SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED FOR BREATHABILITY, AND WITH A ZERO-SMELL PROFILE HARVESTED FROM HIGH IN OUTSIDE MY SPHIEWDIO. I JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT TO MY DRINK HERE. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THIS AIR NEEDS TO BREATHE A LITTLE BIT. I THINK I'LL LEAVE THAT OPEN. NEXT UP, FOLKS, OUR MISSION HERALITY COLBERT PLATINUM IS TO OFFER ADVICE FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE UBERRICH SET. I'D LIKE TO SHARE A TIP WITH THE UNDERSERVED WEALTH COMMUNITY. DICTATORS, IN A SUBSEGMENT I CALLED "STEPHEN COBARE'S HOT DIP TICKS." IF YOU'RE A SHADOWY, DEVELOPING WORLD DESPOT WITH MONEY AND AVAILABLES TO BURN YOU'LL WANT TO GET A HOLD OF THIS SEASON'S MUST-HAVE ACCESSORY.
KANYE WEST POCKETED SOME $3 MILLION PERFORMING FOR A CONTROVERSIAL DICTATOR. THE RAPPER FLEW ALL THE WAY TO KAZAKHSTAN TO PLAY AT THE PRESIDENT'S GRANDSON'S WEDDING. HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF STEALING THE COUNTRY'S OIL FOR HIMSELF AND VIOLATE, HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING MURDER.
Stephen:  NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, WHAT IS THIS POWER HUNGRY MEGALOMANIAC DOING HANGING OUT WITH THE PRESIDENT OF KAZAKHSTAN. IT'S SIMPLE, FOLKS-- MONEY TALKS AND CELEBRITIES HAVE EXCELLENT HEARING. PERSONALLY, I DO THIS KIND OF GIG ALL THE TIME. ROBERT MUGABE SAID HE LOVED MY MARK TWAIN ONE-MAN SHOW. THE CRITICS DID NOT LIKE IT. THE POINT IS, KANYE AND I ARE NOT THE ONLY A-LIFTERS AVAILABLE TO TOAST YOUR PREPRESSIVE REGIME.
THE CONCERT ORGANIZED BY INA'S STATE-OWNED OIL COMPANY, , JENNIFER LOPEZ SANG HAPPYING ABOUT THE TO TURKMENISTAN'S RULER, KURBANGULY BERDYMUKHAMEDOV. IT IS A COUNTRY SO REPRESSIVE IT ONCE BANNED CIRCUSES AND OPERAS AND WHERE THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS ARBITRARY ARREST, TOORT TORTURE, AND DISREGARD FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES HAPPEN FREQUENTLY.
Stephen:  OKAY, MAYBE, BUT THE CHINESE STATE OIL COMPANY WAS IN A TERRIBLE POSITION. THEY HAD TO GET J. LO TO SINGLE HAPPY BIRTHDAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIT KURBANGULY BERDYMUKHAMEDOV ON A CAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, NOW,-- ( APPLAUSE ) LOVELY COUPLE. NOW, MY FRIEND KERBIE'S DONE SOME QUESTIONABLE THINGS, YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN J. LO WAS WRONG HERE.
J. LO'S REPS SAY, "HAD THERE BEEN KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES OF ANY KIND, JENNIFER WOULD NOT HAVE ATTENDED."
Stephen:  THANK YOU. HOW COULD SHE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT TURKMENISTAN'S APPALLING HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS? GOOGLE? THE POINT IS, IF YOU'RE A MEGALOMANIACAL DESPOT GET YOURSELF AN AMERICAN CELEBRITY BECAUSE IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, THEY WILL PERFORM FOR ANYONE NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY HAVE CRUSHED THE LITTLE GUY. I MEAN, ALEX BALDWIN DOES THOSE CAPITAL ONE ADS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
