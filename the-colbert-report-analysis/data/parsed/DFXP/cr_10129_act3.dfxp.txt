WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY, MY GUEST IS NEW YORK'S MOST IMPORTANT RESIDENT. PLEASE WELCOME MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO. (APPLAUSE) MR. MAYOR. I HOPE YOU'RE READY, SIR, BECAUSE THE FREE RIDE IS OVER. ALL RIGHT?
THIS AIN'T THE UPPER WEST SIDE, OKAY. THIS IS THE COLBERT NATION, ALL RIGHT? FOR THE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW YOU ARE THE 109th MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY. BEFORE THAT YOU WERE THE CITY'S PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND BEFORE THAT YOU WERE A CITY COUNCILMAN. WHAT IS YOUR VISION, SIR, OF THIS GREAT CITY, YOU WANT TO BRING US BACK TO THE 80s. THE BAD DAYS OF THE SQUEEGEE MEN AND RAMPANT CRIME AND LEG WARMERS, THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?
THE LEG WARMERS WEREN'T SO BAD. BUT IT'S A PROGRESSIVE VISION, AN INCLUSIVE VISION, CREATING A CITY OF OPPORTUNITY.
PROGRESSIVE MEANS SOCIALIST, YOU'RE A SOCIALIST.
PROGRESSIVE MEANS CREATING OPPORTUNITY.
YOU ARE A SOCIALIST OR YOU ARE NOT A SOCIALIST, YOU RAISED MONEY FOR THE SANDINISTAS IN THE 80s. YOU ARE A SOCIALIST, YOU ARE A COMMUNIST.
STEPHEN, IN THIS COUNTRY WITH VAST INCOME INEQUALITY, AND GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY, WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO CHANGE OUR COURSE.
WHY DO WE HAVE TO CHANGE COURSE. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THE INCOME DO NOT WISH YOU TO CHANGE OUR COURSE.
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.
OKAY.
BUT LOOK AT NEW YORK CITY, THE WORST INCOME INEQUALITY SINCE 1929 AND A SITUATION WHERE MORE AND MORE OF OUR PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. 46% OF ALL NEW YORKERS AT OR NEAR THE POVERTY LEVEL. WE CAN'T CONTINUE WITH A DIVIDED SOCIETY. IN FACT, WE WANT TO CREATE SOME UNITY. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE MORE JOBS, HIGHER WAGES AND BENEFITS, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE PAID SICK LEAVE.
GOVERNMENT CAN'T CREATE JOBS.
GOVERNMENT.
ONLY THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN CREATE JOBS BY TRICKLING DOWN TO THE POOR PEOPLE, AND I AS A RICH PERSON AND MY FRIENDS, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY YET TO COME OVER THE RIM OF OUR BUCKET AND START TRICKLING. WE'RE SO CLOSE. I PROMISE YOU I PROMISE YOU, ANY DAY NOW IF YOU JUST LET US HAVE MORE OF THE MONEY, IT WILL-- THAT TRICKLE, IT'S LIKE A SIPHON, ONCE IT GETS GOING. ONCE IF GETS GOING. (APPLAUSE)
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS THAT CLOSE.
OH YEAH, WE'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE, SO PLEASE.
I THINK GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE SURE THERE'S FAIRNESS IN OUR SOCIETY. AND I THINK GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE SURE, THANK YOU, THAT THERE IS-- WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE DECENT WAGES AND BENEFITS, THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS GETS REESTABLISHED. THAT WE HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY PREPARES OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR A FUTURE. NEXT YEAR, WE WILL HAVE FULL DAY PRE-K FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE CITY.
LET'S GET TO THAT BECAUSE TO HAND OUT THE FREE, YOU KNOW, NAP TIMES AND JUICE BOXES YOU WANT TO DO TO THESE, YOU KNOW, THESE FREELOADING MISCREANTS, THAT YOU WANTED TO TAX RICH GUYS LIKE ME, YOU SAID  THE RICH OF NEW YORK WILL PAY FOR THIS. YOU GOT STOPPED FROM DOING THAT. BUT WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE MY MONEY AWAY. WHY IS IT MY PROBLEM IF SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T AFFORD PRE-K GETS PRE-K. LET THEM WORK FOR IT THEMSELVES.
MOST FOUR-YEAR-OLDS ARE NOT YET IN THE WORKFORCE.
OKAY, THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. DO YOU REALIZE THOSE LITTLE HANDS CHANGE BOBBINS SO WELL.
I THINK THE FACT IS IT IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST, IT'S IN THOSE WHO ARE DOING WELL'S INTEREST. IT IS IN FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING'S INTEREST TO HAVE A STRONGER SOCIETY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. AN EDUCATED SOCIETY. THE FUTURE OF THIS CITY, THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY RUNS THROUGH OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO FULL DAY PRE-K. FULL DAY PRE-K MEANS THAT YOU'LL HAVE KIDS WITH A SOLID FOUNDATION REGARDLESS OF DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND. EVERYONE GETTING REAL OPPORTUNITY AND READY FOR THE MODERN ECONOMY WHICH DEMANDS A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION TREATMENT THAN ANY TIME IN HISTORY. REAL NATIONAL SECURITY, REAL STRENGTH DERIVES FROM AN EDUCATED PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HERE IN THIS CITY. (APPLAUSE)
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE IN THIS CITY AND THAT IS A RAIL STRIKE, OKAY. WE COULD VERY WELL HAVE 8 UNIONS SHUT DOWN THE LIRR COME SUNDAY-- MONDAY MORNING, 12:01 A.M. ON MONDAY. WHAT ARE YOU AS MAYOR GOING DO TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING. ARE YOU SENDING IN THE PINKERTONS WITH THE TRUNCHEONS TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF ALL DADDY WAR BUCKS?
THE LONG ISLAND RAILROAD IS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF GOVERNOR CUOMO, HE IS WORKING VERY HARD TO COME TO A RESOLUTION.
NOT MY PROBLEM.
NO, IT'S SOMETHING --
BRING ME THE BOWL, THAT PONTIUS PILATE MAY WASH HIS HANDS.
I'M HOPEFUL HE WILL GET TO A RESOLUTION WITH THE UNIONS.
MAYOR BLOOMBERG WAS IN OFFICE FOR THREE TERMS. HE NEVER TOOK A WEEK OFF.
UH-HUH.
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY STILL BE IN YOUR OFFICE HIDING IN THE CABINET SOMEPLACE. WILL YOU NOW ADMIT, NOW  YOU'RE SAFELY ENSCONCED IN OFFICE. NOT GOING TO YANK YOU OUT OF THERE. WILL YOU ADMIT THAT MAYOR BLOOMBERG WAS A GREAT MAYOR FOR THE CITY.
MAYOR BLOOMBERG DID SOME THINGS WELL. AND MAYOR BLOOMBERG MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES. STAYING FOR A THIRD YEAR WAS A HUGE MISTAKE. IT WAS VERY UNDEMOCRATIC HE USED HIS WEALTH TO ACHIEVE IT. BUT IN OFFICE HE DID SOME VERY GOOD THINGS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. HE DID SOME GOOD THINGS TO MAKE US A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE CITY. DID SOME GOOD INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION. BUT IN THE END, HE DID NOT ADDRESS INCOME INEQUALITY. HE DID NOT ADDRESS STOP AND FRISK. HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WERE TEARING CITY AND DEMAND A RESOLUTION.
YOU ADDRESSED STOP AND FRISK. YOU STOPPED STOP AND FRISK AS WE KNOW IT BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOW IF I RANDOMLY GROPE YOUNG BLACK MEN I SEEM LIKE A WEIRDO.
THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.
OKAY.
WELL MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NEW YORK CITY MAYOR, BILL DE BLASIO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
