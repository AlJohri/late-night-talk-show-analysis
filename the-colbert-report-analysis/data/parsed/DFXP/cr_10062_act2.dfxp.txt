Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, WE NOW TURN TO OUR CONTINUING SPORT REPORT COVERAGE ALREADY IN PROGRESS. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN A LIFELONG FOOTBALL FAN FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS NOW. AND LIKE ALL HARD-CORE FOOT NUTS I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MAY'S NFL DRAFT UNTIL I SAW THIS.
AN ALL AMERICAN FOOTBALL STAR REVEALED HE IS GAY.
MISSOURI MICHAEL SAM CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET.
MICHAEL SAM TO BE DRAFTED TO THE NFL WOULD MAKE HIM THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYER IN THAT LEAGUE.
I CAME TO TELL THE WORLD I'M AN OPENLY PROUD GAY MAN.
OK THAT TOOK COURAGE BUT WE CAN'T HAVE A GAY FOOTBALL PLAYER! IT IS FIRST AND TEN, NOT FIRST IN STEVE. AND THE MOST OFFENSIVE PART, MICHAEL SAM DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MIGHT BE OFFENDED.
THIS IS TO ME JUST TELLING ANOTHER PERSON, HEY, I'M GAY AND IT SHOULDN'T A BIG PROBLEM.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT NOBODY CHOOSES TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS. I WAS BORN HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THIS. LOOK. LOOK, COME ON, NOBODY IS SAYING THIS GUY IS NOT A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER. ALL-AMERICAN, THE SEC'S DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR THAT IS QUITE AN HONOR COMING FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. BUT NOW-- PRO TEAMS ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE DRAFTING HIM.
"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" SPOKE WITH NEARLY A DOZEN COACHES AND NFL EXECUTIVES, MANY OF WHOM SAID FOOTBALL ISN'T READY FOR AN OPENLY GAY PLAYER.
YESTERDAY MICHAEL SAM WAS PROJECTED AS THE THIRD OR FOURTH ROUND PICK, BUT DEFINITELY ON THE BOARD. AND TODAY EXECUTIVES WILL SAY ANONYMOUSLY THAT HIS STOCK HAS DROPPED. HE MAY NOT EVEN BE DRAFTED.
I THINK A NUMBER OF TEAMS WILL PROBABLY NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH HIM AT ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE SO-CALLED DISTRACTION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.
THE THING YOU TALK ABOUT IN THE ORGANIZATION WITH THE GM AND OBVIOUSLY THE OWNER, IS CAN WE HANDLE THIS GUY. CAN THE PLAYERS HANDLE THE MEDIA ATTENTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET. WHEN THEY GET THE QUESTION ASKED ARE YOU OKAY WITH A GAY TEAMMATE.
Stephen: EXACTLY. I MEAN JUST THINK OF THAT QUESTION. ARE YOU OKAY WITH A GAY TEAMMATE. WHO WANTS TO PUT THEIR PLAYERS THROUGH THE AGONY OF SAYING --
YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I MEAN I JUST-- CAN'T-- I CANNOT BELIEVE WE HAVE COME TO THIS AS A NATION, TO SULLY GAME OF BEN ROETHLISBERGER AND MICHAEL VICK WITH A GAY GUY. SO FOLKS, ALL OF THAT JUSTIFIES NOT DRAFTING THE TOP DEFENSIVE PLAYER IN THE SEC.
AND MICHAEL SAM'S ONLY CHANCE IS TO GO BACK IN THE CLOSET, MIKE, WE'LL PRETEND YOU'RE NOT GAY AS LONG AS YOU PRETEND WE'RE NOT BIGOTS. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL ALSO BE RIGHT BACK.
