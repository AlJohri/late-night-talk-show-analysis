WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FAMILY  THERAPIST WHO STUDIES WHY PEOPLE HAVE AFFAIRS. I HOPE YOU'RE WATCHING WITH SOMEONE YOU ARE PRETEND TO LOVE PLEASE WELCOME ESTHER PEREL. MS. PEREL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT. YOUNG LADY, BESIDES BEING THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "MATING IN ACTIVITY: UNLOCKING EROTIC INTELLIGENCE," YOU'RE A COUPLES AND FAMILY THERAPIST IN NEW YORK CITY AND YOU SPECIALIZE WITH PEOPLE HAVING AFFAIRS AND YOU ACTUALLY IN THE PAST YEAR YOU EXPLODED ON THE WEB WITH A TED TALK YOU GAVE ABOUT WHY PEOPLE HAVE AFFAIRS AND HOW THE KEEP RELATIONSHIPS FRESH. ESPECIALLY SEXUALLY. 4.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED IT. ALL RIGHT. SO I'LL BITE. ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] WHICH IS HOW I KEEP THINGS FRESH. WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE AFFAIRS? AND DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO HAVE THEM? [LAUGHTER]
I'LL START FROM THE SECOND PART.
Stephen: OKAY.
AN AFFAIR IS A BETRAYAL. AN AFFAIR IS A VIOLATION OF TRUST THAT IS NEVER OKAY.
Stephen: OKAY SO NEVER HAVE AN AFFAIR.
BUT PEOPLE DO. AND THEY HAVE HAD AFFAIRS SINCE MARRIAGE WAS INVENTED. SO MUCH SO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME STRANGE.
Stephen: NO NOT AT ALL. I'M WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP HERE. SO FAR NOTHING TOO CONTROVERSIAL.
NO. SO THE INTERESTING THING FOR ME IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND INFIDELITY IS TO LOOK AT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR DISCONTENT OR THEIR LONELINESS OR THEIR SEXUAL FRUSTRATIONS AND THAT THAT LEADS THEM TO BE UNFAITHFUL IS NOT SO DIFFICULT. WHAT STRIKES ME IS WHY HAPPY PEOPLE CHEAT, WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY LOVING THEIR PARTNER AND ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR FAMILY, TO THEIR CHILDREN, TO THE PROJECT THAT THEY CREATED TOGETHER ALSO FIND THEMSELVES STRAYING, WHY THEY END UP SOME DAY CROSSING A LINE THAT THEY NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD CROSS. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS FOR A GLIMMER OF WHAT? WHAT IS IT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LONGING FOR, SEEKING?
Stephen: I THINK THEY'RE SEEKING SEX.
ACTUALLY, NO.
Stephen: NO?
NO.
Stephen: NO.
NO. I THINK IT'S A VERY EASY THING THAT WE OFTEN WANT TO THINK THAT AFFAIRS ARE ABOUT SEX. AFFAIRS ARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT SEX AND A LOT ABOUT DESIRE. AFFAIRS ARE...
Stephen: DESIRE FOR...
DESIRE FOR ATTENTION, DESIRE TO EXPERIENCE A SENSE OF ALIVENESS, VIBRANCE, VITALITY.
Stephen: IN THE GROINAL AREA.
THE GROINAL AREA IS A VERY NARROW VIEW OF WHERE SEX TAKES PLACE.
Stephen: SOME OF THEM ARE WIDER THAN OTHERS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] PLEASE. GO AHEAD. OKAY.
, SO YOU KNOW...
Stephen: SO HAPPY PEOPLE HAVE AFFAIRS.
YES. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE DON'T ONLY LEAVE A PARTNER BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE, BUT SOMETIMES WE ACTUALLY WANT TO FIND ANOTHER SELF.
Stephen: FIND ANOTHER SELF?
YES. THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT AFFAIRS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO RECONNECT WITH LOST PARTS OF THEMSELVES.
Stephen: OH, SO, "HONEY, I WASN'T PUSHING YOU AWAY, I WAS JUST PULLING ME TOWARDS MYSELF." I WASN'T ACTUALLY CHEATING ON YOU, I WAS FINDING ME. THAT'S A GREAT LINE.
I WAS DOING BOTH. YOU CHEAT AND YOU FIND YOU. THE STRANGE THING, THE PAINFUL THING ABOUT AFFAIRS IS THAT IT'S A DUAL STORY. WHILE ONE PERSON IS EXPERIENCING EXPANSION AND GROWTH AND ALIVENESS, ONCE IT IS KNOWN, THE OTHER PERSON EXPERIENCE UTTER DEVASTATION AND PAIN AND TRAUMA AND THESE TWO ARE COEXISTING SIDE BY SIDE. SHOULD YOU TELL YOUR PARTNER YOU HAD AN AFFAIR?
YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU TELL, ASK YOURSELF... THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED QUESTIONS, TELLING OR NOT TELLING, AND WHAT IS IT YOU TELL? DO YOU EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED, OR DO YOU EXPLAIN THE SORDID DETAILS? BUT BEFORE YOU TELL, YOU ASK YOURSELF, WHO IS THIS FOR? IS THIS TO UNLOAD MY BAD CONSCIENCE OR IS THIS REALLY BECAUSE I'M THINKING ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF MY PARTNER. BEFORE YOU TELL, ASK YOURSELF, DOES YOUR PARTNER ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW? AND BEFORE YOU TELL, ASK YOURSELF WHETHER YOU'D LIKE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF KNOWING. IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED THING THIS TELLING BUSINESS.
Stephen: SO DON'T TELL.
NO. THINK. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: COMPLICATED.
YES.
Stephen: NOW, WHAT CONSTITUTES AN AFFAIR? I AM IN A LOVING, COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP WITH MY WIFE LORRAINE. AND LORRAINE'S A WONDERFUL WOMAN, I LOVE HER, AND IT'S VERY FRESH, BUT FOR NINE YEARS I'VE HAD A HOT AND SLOPPY RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE PEOPLE OUT HERE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IS AN AFFAIR ALWAYS PHYSICAL OR CAN IT BE JUST EMOTIONAL?
AN AFFAIR CAN BE THE WHOLE MYRIAD OF THINGS. IT CAN BE A FANTASY. IT CAN BE INACTIVE. IT CAN BE PHYSICAL. IT CAN BE EMOTIONAL. IT CAN BE SEXUAL AND IT CAN BE JUST FANTASIZED. WHAT CONSTITUTES AN AFFAIR IS THE ACTUAL BETRAYAL OF  THE TRUST, NOT THE BEHAVIOR. FOR SOME PEOPLE, A ONE-NIGHT STAND IS NO LESS PAINFUL THAN A 30-YEAR PARALLEL LIFE. WHAT CONSTITUTES IT IS THE BREACH OF TRUST, NOT WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN DOING WITH THESE PEOPLE FOR NINE YEARS.
Stephen: THAT'S BETWEEN ME AND THEM. ALL RIGHT. ESTHER PEREL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. MATING IN CAPTIVITY, ESTHER PEREL. CHECK HER OUT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
