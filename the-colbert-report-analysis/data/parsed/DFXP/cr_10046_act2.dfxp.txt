Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, IF YOU WERE WATCHING THE SHOW-- AND I HOPE THAT YOU WERE-- RIGHT BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK I REPORTED THAT IN RESPONSE TO ANTI-GAY LAWS IN RUSSIA PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SENDING AN OLYMPIC DELEGATION WHICH INCLUDES GAY TENNIS LEGEND BILLIE JEAN KING AND FIGURE SKATER BRIAN BOITANO WHO JUST TWO DAYS AFTER HE WAS NAMED TO THE DELEGATION ALSO CAME OUT. OOH, RIGHT AFTER HE BOOKED A TRIP TO RUSSIA. TOUGH TIME TO DISCOVER YOU'RE GAY! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS BREACH OF THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT. OBAMA KNOWS THE HOST COUNTRY IS AGAINST THE GAYS. SO HE SENDS A BUNCH OF THEM OVER THERE? THAT'S LIKE GETTING INVITED TO A POTLUCK DINNER WHERE YOU KNOW HOST HAS A PEANUT ALLERGY SO YOU BRING A TRAY OF PAD THAI AND GAY PEOPLE! (LAUGHTER) THIS IS NOT HOW THE U.S. SHOULD REPRESENT ITSELF DURING THE SOCHI GAMES. HERE TO TELL ME HOW THE U.S. SHOULD REPRESENT ITSELF DURING THE SOCHI GAMES, PLEASE WELCOME DELEGATE MEMBER, TENNIS GREAT BILLIE JEAN KING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BILLIE JEAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WOW, YOU GOT THEM RILED.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU ARE MAYBE THE MOST VISIBLE GAY ATHLETE IN THE WORLD. I MEAN -- BUT THE LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE GAY PROPAGANDA. ISN'T YOUR MERE EXISTENCE PROPAGANDA FOR HOMOSEXUALITY? BECAUSE YOU MAKE IT LOOK GOOD.
WELL, I HOPE SO!
Stephen: YES.
BUT THE THREE OF US, BRIAN AND KAITLIN AND US, COME ON, WHEN WE SHOW UP ISN'T THAT A STATEMENT?
Stephen: YES, BUT IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
WE BETTER HAVE PRETTY GOOD SECURITY THEN.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING OVER TO REPRESENT THE COUNTRY IN THE PLACE OF OBAMA. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE GOING TO BE?
WELL, I PROBABLY WON'T PROTEST BUT IF THE MEDIA ASKS ME A QUESTION I'M GOING ANSWER IT. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: REALLY.
ABSOLUTELY. WHY NOT?
Stephen: YOU'LL BE BREAKING THE LAW. IF YOU SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT HOMOSEXUALS OR ABOUT HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS YOU'LL BE BREAKING THE LAW. TECHNICALLY YOU COULD BE THROWN INTO JAIL.
WELL, I'LL TAKE THAT CHANCE, I GUESS.
Stephen: REALLY? SURE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE DO MEET VLADIMIR PUTIN OR YOU THINK SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT DO THE INTERROGATING? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S -- I HAVE NO IDEA. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING GO THINK ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: SAY HI, HE'S A FRIEND.
IS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?
Stephen: YEAH.
WHAT KIND OF A GUY IS HE?
Stephen: OFTEN SHIRTLESS. DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BRAVER OF OBAMA AND SHOWN MORE LEADERSHIP IF HE HAD JUST CHOSEN TO BE GAY FOR TWO WEEKS AND GONE OVER THERE HIMSELF? (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF.
Stephen: BUT YOU AGREE IT'S A CHOICE?
A CHOICE? NO.
Stephen: IT'S NOT? OKAY.
NO I DO NOT THINK THAT.
Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T READ THE SCIENCE LATELY ON THAT.
OH, I HEAR PEOPLE SAY IT'S A CHOICE.
Stephen: I HOPE YOU HEARD ME JUST SAY IT JUST NOW.
WELL, YOU'VE HAD A CHOICE AND YOU'RE STRAIGHT.
Stephen: OH, I DEFINITELY CHOSE TO BE STRAIGHT-- I HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO BE GAY, BABY! (LAUGHTER) I HAD MY PICK OF THE LITTER. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A GROUP OF GAY MEN, A LITTER OF GAY MEN.
BUT YOU HAVE SUCH TWINKLY BROWN EYES. I BET THEY DID PRETTY WELL, YEAH.
Stephen: I'M WORKING MY MAGIC ON YOU.
YOU ARE WORKING THE MAGIC.
Stephen: IT WAS SAID -- IT HAS BEEN SAID AND I THINK YOU'VE ADMITTED THAT YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE YOU A GREAT ATHLETE BUT YOU'RE A WELL-KNOWN HOMOSEXUAL ATHLETE. WHAT DOES IT --
I LIKE "GAY." IT'S SO MUCH HAPPIER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REALLY. GAY?
GAY'S LIKE, FUN! YOU KNOW --.
Stephen: SO GAY IS OKAY. I THOUGHT GAY WAS MEN, I THOUGHT IT WAS GAY AND LESBIAN.
I JUST LOVE GAY BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO HAPPY.
Stephen: REALLY.
YES, I'M A GAY WOMAN, I LIKE THAT.
Stephen: OK, YOU'RE NOT OFFENDED THAT YOU'RE BEING CHOSEN BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY?
NO, I'M PROUD OF IT!  I LOVE IT! >>Stephen: BUT AREN'T YOU WORRIED? I LOVE IT, ARE YOU KIDDING? JUST THE OPPOSITE. COME ON!
Stephen: YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE LGBT FIGHT FOR RIGHTS IS THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE OF THE 21st CENTURY.
IT IS ONE OF THEM ABSOLUTELY. OR THE ONE, YES.
Stephen: DOES THAT MAKE RUSSIA THE ALABAMA OF THE 21st CENTURY? [LAUGHTER]
YEAH IT COULD. SURE, WHY NOT?
Stephen: ONE MORE THING. THE LAST THING ON HERE. YOU WILL ADMIT THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ON THIS SHOW THERE WAS SOME -- THERE WAS SOME HEAT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.
TOTALLY. I ACTUALLY -- DIDN'T I JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR TWINKLY BROWN EYES? ABSOLUTELY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OK WELL, THANK YOU. DO YOU THINK THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN SOCIETY WILL ACCEPT LOVE BETWEEN A HAPPILY MARRIED MAN AND A GAY WOMAN? (LAUGHTER)
I HOPE SO!
Stephen: PERHAPS THAT'S THE CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE OF THE 22nd CENTURY.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL YOU ARE A MAN AHEAD OF YOUR TIME.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME BILLIE JEAN. BILLIE JEAN KING, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
