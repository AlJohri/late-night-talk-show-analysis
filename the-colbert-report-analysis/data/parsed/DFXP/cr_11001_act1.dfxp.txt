(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (SHOUTING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THAT  ANYWHERE ELSE! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! YOU WON'T GET THAT KIND OF MINDLESS ADULATION  ANYWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA! FOLKS, I HAVE TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU HERE, WHILE I MAY BE AT ODDS WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION, AS A PATRIOT, I FEEL IT'S MY DUTY IN A TIME OF WAR TO SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT. AND THAT'S ENOUGH. (LAUGHTER) 'CUZ I HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH WHAT THIS GUY DOES. AND EVEN WHEN I DO LIKE WHAT HE DOES, I DON'T. (LAUGHTER) CASE IN DON'T:  HIS INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT ON THIS HOUR HAS "60 MINUTES" IN WHICH HE FINALLY ADDRESSED WHY, WHEN IT CAME TO ADDRESSING SYRIA, HE WAS JOHNNY BOMB LATELY.
HOW DID THEY END UP WHERE THEY ARE IN CONTROL  OF SO MUCH TERRITORY? WAS THAT A COMPLETE SURPRISE TO YOU?
WELL, I THINK OUR HEAD OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, JIM CLAPPER, HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT I THINK THEY UNDERESTIMATED WHAT HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE IN SYRIA.
STEPHEN: S'CUSE ME! BOMBING THE MIDDLE EAST AND THEN THROWING THE C.I.A. UNDER THE BUS IS KINDA GEORGE BUSH'S THING. (LAUGHTER)
IT IS TRUE THAT MUCH OF THE INTELLIGENCE TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG.
STEPHEN: YES, "MUCH" OF THE INTELLIGENCE TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG. BUT NOT ALL OF IT. THERE WAS A COUNTRY CALLED IRAQ. (LAUGHTER) IT WILL BE MISSED. (LAUGHTER) AND IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME BUSH HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF BY PRESIDENT BARACK O-ROB-A. (LAUGHTER) TAKE THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH LAST WEEK AT THE ANNUAL U.N. TRAFFIC FESTIVAL. (LAUGHTER) HE STOOD UP IN FRONT OF THAT OLD KITCHEN BACKSPLASH OR WHATEVER IT IS -- TIME TO REMODEL, GUYS -- AND TRIED TO TALK TOUGH ON I.S.I.S.
THE ONLY LANGUAGE UNDERSTOOD BY THE KILLERS LIKE THIS IS THE LANGUAGE OF FORCE. SO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL WORK WITH A BROAD COALITION TO DISMANTLE THIS NETWORK OF DEATH. NO GOD CONDONES THIS TERROR. NO GRIEVANCE JUSTIFIES THESE ACTIONS. THERE CAN BE NO REASONING, NO NEGOTIATION WITH THIS BRAND OF EVIL.
STEPHEN: SIR, WE ALREADY HAVE A BRAND OF EVIL. IT'S TOM'S OF MAINE. (LAUGHTER) MAYBE TOM SHOULD LEAVE MAINE ONCE IN A WHILE TO FIND OUT WHAT TOOTHPASTE IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE! (LAUGHTER) AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE CALLING HIM OUT ON THIS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SURE SOUNDED A LOT LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH YESTERDAY.
HE'S SOUNDING A LOT LIKE HIM THESE DAYS.
DID YOU HEAR THE SPEECH AT THE U.N.? WAS THAT VOICE MORE LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA?
THIS IS A SPEECH WHERE IF YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES, YOU COULD HAVE HEARD GEORGE W. BUSH GIVING THIS SPEECH.
STEPHEN: YES, EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES, I CAN HEAR GEORGE BUSH GIVING A SPEECH. (LAUGHTER) HOLD ON... SHHH, HE'S TALKING AGAIN. WHAT'S THAT, SIR? WHY, YES, MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LOVE TO GET A SEGUEWAY RIDE WITH YOU AND GO GET A HOT DOG. LOOK OUT FOR THAT TREE! OOH! LOOK, SIR, I GOT TO GO BACK TO THE SHOW AND DO THE THING. MY EYES ARE CLOSED. I CAN'T READ THE SCROLLY WORDS THEY HAVE UP HERE. OK, I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE. SERIOUSLY,  WHAT ARE YOU GONNA STEAL FROM BUSH NEXT, MR. PRESIDENT? 'CUZ YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE! EVEN POLITICO POINTED OUT THAT IF YOU TYPE OBAMA'S MONEY PHRASE -- "NETWORK OF DEATH "-- INTO THESAURUS.COM, GEORGE W. BUSH'S "AXIS OF EVIL" COULD VERY WELL COME OUT. YES, IT COULD VERY WELL COME OUT. NO, I TRIED IT AND IT DOESN'T COME OUT, BUT IF I DIDN'T, IT MIGHT HAVE. CLEARLY, PRESIDENT KUMBAYA IS JUST TRYING TO LOOK TOUGH IN THE MIDDLE EAST BY MAD-LIBBING THE GREATEST HITS OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. I DREAD THE DAY WHEN "MISSION ACCOMPLISHED" BECOMES "JOB DID." (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT FOLKS, WHETHER OR NOT OBAMA IS UP FOR DIDDING THE JOB, WE KNOW THAT AFTER 2016, BARACK OBAMA WILL BE LEAVING OFFICE. WEAK MOVE, MR. PRESIDENT. NEVER ANNOUNCE A TIMETABLE FOR WITHDRAWAL! (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE POWER VACUUM HE LEAVES BEHIND MAY BE FILLED BY HILLARY CLINTON, AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE ON AN INEVITABLE PATH TOWARDS MAYBE ANNOUNCING A CANDIDACY SOMEDAY. (LAUGHTER) AND BIG ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEKEND MAKES HER EVEN MORE MAYBE.
IT'S A GIRL. A GIRL FOR CHELSEA CLINTON AND HER HUSBAND MARC MEZVINSKY. CHARLOTTE CLINTON MEZVINSKY.
IT'S THE FIRST CHILD FOR CLINTON AND HER HUSBAND MARC AND THE FIRST GRANDCHILD FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY OF STATE.
STEPHEN: YET ANOTHER HILLARY FLIP-FLOP. FOUR DAYS AGO, SHE WASN'T A GRANDMOTHER,  NOW SHE CLAIMS SHE IS. HOW CAN WE TRUST HER? IT GETS TO BASIC ISSUES HERE. (APPLAUSE) NOW, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO CONGRATULATE THE HAPPY FAMILY. CHARLOTTE IS A BEAUTIFUL BABY -- HOPE YOU KEEP HER AS FAR AWAY FROM PARTISAN POLITICS AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. BUT I JUST GOTTA SAY, "CHARLOTTE"? KIND OF SUSPICIOUS SHE WAS NAMED AFTER THE LARGEST CITY IN A MAJOR SWING STATE. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: IF IT HAD BEEN A BOY, WOULD WE BE CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF LITTLE BABY AKRON? AND I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM -- BY WHICH I MEAN ALL THE ELEPHANTS IN THE ROOM.
THE BABY REPORTEDLY HAS AN ELEPHANT-THEMED NURSERY.
THE NURSERY WILL BE DECORATED WITH ELEPHANTS, OF COURSE, THE MASCOT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
STEPHEN: YES, A NURSERY DECORATED WITH ADORABLE REPUBLICAN ELEPHANTS. THEY BORROWED THE DESIGN FROM PAUL RYAN'S BEDROOM. (APPLAUSE) AND YOU KNOW IT'S A CYNICAL PLOY TO APPEAL TO REPUBLICAN-LEANING SWING VOTERS BECAUSE IT WAS PREMEDITATED. RIGHT BEFORE HER BABY WAS BORN, CHELSEA CLINTON CONVENIENTLY HELPED LAUNCH A LINE OF ELEPHANT-THEMED GIFTS TO BENEFIT GROUPS WORKING TO STOP THE POACHING OF AFRICAN ELEPHANTS. A LIKELY STORY. NO ONE POACHES AFRICAN ELEPHANTS. THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER FRIED. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: OH, THEY ARE. HEAR THE AUDIENCE GOING, MMM! MMM! WELL, AS CUTE AS BABY CHARLOTTE IS, HILLARY'S ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE IS ABOUT TO BE DERAILED BY THE GRANDMOTHER OF ALL SCANDALS. BECAUSE FREEBEACON.COM -- YES, "THAT" FREEBEACON.COM -- HAS UNCOVERED A SINGLE LETTER HILLARY SENT IN 1971 TO NONE OTHER THAN SAUL ALINSKY. YES. SAUL ALINSKY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) YES, AS YOU CAN TELL, A NAME INSTANTLY FAMILIAR TO ANYONE CURRENTLY WATCHING THIS IN  THE MIDDLE OF A SOCIOLOGY LECTURE ABOUT SAUL ALINSKY. ALINSKY WAS NOT ONLY A DANGEROUS FAR-LEFT SOCIAL ACTIVIST KNOWN FOR HIS BOOK "RULES FOR RADICALS," HE WAS ALSO THE MAN WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. (LAUGHTER) THIS HILLARY LETTER IS DEVASTATING FOR CLINTON. AFTER ALL, ALINSKY WAS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER FROM CHICAGO -- A DEATH SENTENCE FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT. PLUS, I'M PRETTY SURE BILL CLINTON HAD AN AFFAIR WITH ALINSKY'S DAUGHTER, MONOCLE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND HILLARY'S CLEAR DEEP RADICALIZATION AND CLOSE TIES TO ALINSKY ARE MADE ACHINGLY CLEAR BY THE WAY SHE ASKS WHEN HIS BOOK WAS COMING OUT, AND THAT SHE MISSED THEIR BIENNIAL CONVERSATIONS. TYPICAL LIBERAL DEVIANCE. EVEN THEIR TIME FRAMES ARE BI. BUT THE MOST SHOCKING THING ABOUT HILLARY'S PEN PAL SCANDAL -- OR "PEN-GHAZI" AS I'M CALLING IT -- IS  HOW FEW PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED BY IT. TAKE IT FROM CONSTANTLY SHOCKED JOCK RUSH LIMBAUGH.
A LOT OF DRIVE-BY MEDIA PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FASCINATED BY THE EVENTS THEY COVER... ARE NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST CURIOUS ABOUT A BUNCH OF OLD LETTERS THAT HILLARY CLINTON WROTE, WAY BACK WHEN, HAVE SURFACED... IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS SENDING LETTERS TO ALINSKY LEFT AND RIGHT.
STEPHEN: YES, HILLARY WAS WRITING ALINSKY LEFT AND RIGHT. IN THAT HER SINGLE NOTE TO HIM CONTAINS A BUNCH OF LETTERS  THAT ARE READ FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS JUST PROOF THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN SCRUTINIZED FOR DECADES AS SECRETARY OF STATE, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SENATOR AND FIRST LADY -- BUT THERE'S SO MUCH WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER. FOR INSTANCE, I WENT EVEN FURTHER BACK INTO HER MYSTERIOUS PAST AND OBTAINED A LETTER HILLARY WROTE IN 1953. IT PROVES SHE WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH A FOREIGN LEADER. IT STARTS "DEAR SANTA." I BELIEVE THAT'S A SPANISH NAME! (LAUGHTER) SHE GOES ON TO COLLUDE WITH THIS REDCOAT KNOWN FOR SUPPORTING SLAVE LABOR AND THE EXCLUSION OF JEWS. (LAUGHTER) THEN HILLARY PROVES HER SOCIALIST BONAFIDES BY DEMANDING AN ITEMIZED LIST OF FREE HANDOUTS. AND NO SURPRISE SHE ENDS THE LETTER BY ATTACKING AMERICA'S ENERGY PRODUCERS:  "P.S.  PLEASE DON'T PUT COAL IN MY STOCKING." (LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
