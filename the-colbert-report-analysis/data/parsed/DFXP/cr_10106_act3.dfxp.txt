Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST WHO SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CAN LEAD TO VIOLENCE. I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE TALKS ABOUT IT I WANT TO PUNCH THEM. PLEASE WELCOME THOMAS FRIEDMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TOM, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. ALL RIGHT, IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE. JUST TO REMIND THE PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE. YOU'RE A THREE TIME PULITZER AWARD WINNING COLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES, YOU'VE GOT SIX BEST-SELLING BOOKS NOW YOU'RE IN A SHOWTIME DOCUMENTARY CALLED "YEARS OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY." MONDAYS AT 8:00 P.M. GLOBAL WARMING, THAT BIG A DEAL? IS IT THAT BIG A DEAL? IS IT HAS A SCARY NAME, GLOBAL WARMING. HOW MUCH OF IT IS HYPE?
WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCIENCE WHAT, THEY'LL TELL YOU IS 97% OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THE PLANET IS WARMING BECAUSE OF HUMAN-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE. ICE IS MELTING, SEA LEVEL RISING. YOUR BEACH HOME COULD BE IMPERILED, AS A RESULT, AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS.
Stephen:  WHAT! I HAVE SUNK SOME CASH INTO MY BEACH HOUSE, MY FRIEND. IT'S BEACHFRONT.
IS IT IN OHIO? BECAUSE THAT COULD BE THE BEACHFRONT YOU WANT IN THE FUTURE.
Stephen:  WOW. OKAY, YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION. YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SAY, OKAY, YEAH, IT'S COMING. BUT HAS IT ALREADY COME? IS IT TOO LATE? WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW LAST NIGHT THAT SCIENTISTS ARE NOW SAYING-- TWO DIFFERENT PAPERS SAYING THE GLACIERS IN ANTARCTICA, THEY'RE JUST SLIDING INTO THE SEA, AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE. YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE CARBON OF 1700 AND IT'S STILL GOING TO HAPPEN. SHOULDN'T WE JUST POP THE CHAMPAGNE AND KIND OF LIKE "LAST NIGHT ON EARTH" KIND OF SEX? JUST GIVE UP? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST GIVE UP AND BACCHANIALIA, MASK OF THE RED DEATH, AND WAIT FOR DEATH.
THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THIS CLIMATE SERIES IS IF YOU DO PRESENT IT THAT WAY, PEOPLE SAY LET'S PARTY.
Stephen:  RIGHT. WHAT'S THE USE?
AND IF YOU DON'T-- IF YOU TRY TO MOBILIZE THEM-- I THINK THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THIS-- OUR CHALLENGE NOW IS TO MANAGE THE UNAVOIDABLE AND AVOID THE UNMANAGEABLE. THERE'S STILL  STUFF WE CAN REALLY MITIGATE AND LESSEN IF WE ACT NOW BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS UNLEASH IS TRULY UNMANAGEABLE CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. THERE IS A CLIMATE SCIENTIST DANA MEADOWS WHO SAID EVERYTHING WE DO, WE HAVE TO APPROACH AS WE HAVE EXACTLY ENOUGH TIME STARTING NOW. AND THAT'S I THINK HAS TO BE YOUR APPROACH. WE HAVE--
Stephen:  NOW JUST PASSED. NOW THERE'S NO TIME.
NOW WE HAVE EXACTLY ENOUGH TIME STARTING NOW.
Stephen:  THEN BEFORE YOU WERE LYING. BEFORE YOU WERE LYING. WHICH IS IT, TOM?
IT'S THE ONLY APPROACH YOU CAN TAKE.
Stephen:  ONE OF THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT, YOU GO TO SYRIA AT ONE POINT IN THIS. WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU. EXPLAIN-- LET'S WATCH THE CLIP AND THEN EXPLAIN TO US WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.
THEY TOOK YOU AWAY FOR TWO MONTHS.
Stephen:  SO WHAT DOES GLOBAL WARMING HAVING TO DO WITH THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA?
SO SYRIA IN THE FOUR YEARS LEADING UP TO THE OUTBREAK OF THE CIVIL WAR THERE, STEPHEN, HAD THE WORST DROUGHT IN ITS MODERN HISTORY. AND THE WOMAN WE WERE INTERVIEWING IS FROM NORTHERN SYRIA AND THAT IS IS HER SON, WHO IS A FIGHTER. SHE WAS BASICALLY EXPLAINING THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THEIR FARM WAS WIPED OUT. ABOUT 1 MILLION FARMERS AND HERDERS LEFT THE COUNTRYSIDE, FLOCKED TO THE CITIES BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT. THE GOVERNMENT DID NOTHING FOR THEM. SO WHEN THE REVOLUTION STARTED-- FOR POLITICAL REASONS, IT WASN'T CAUSED BY THE DROUGHT-- WHEN IT STARTED YOU HAD A MILLION-- NORMALLY CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE, HERDERS AND FARMERS-- WHO COULDN'T WAIT TO JOIN THE REVOLUTION.
Stephen:  THEY HAD NO OTHER OPTIONS AT THAT POINT.
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAD DONE NOTHING FOR THEM. SYRIA COULDN'T HANDLE THE DROUGHT WHEN THEY HAD A GOVERNMENT. NOW THEY HAVE NO GOVERNMENT. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE NEXT ONE COMES ALONG? AND THE SCIENTISTS SAY IT WILL GET HOTTER.
Stephen:  YESTERDAY, IN CALIFORNIA, THIS WAS-- THERE WAS A FIRE TORNADO.
YEAH.
Stephen:  IN CALIFORNIA. THAT STATE-- THERE ARE FIRES ALL UP AND DOWN THAT STATE. IS THIS GLOBAL WARMING I'M LOOKING AT? IS THIS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT.
WHAT I PREFER TO CALL IT IS GLOBAL WEIRDING. THE HOTS GET HOTTER. THE WETS GET WETTER. THE DRIES GET DRIER. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME REALLY WEIRD STUFF.
Stephen:  IT'S MONDAYS AT 8:00 P.M. I WANT TO WATCH IT. I ONLY HAVE A DIESEL-POWERED TELEVISION. ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU STILL WANT ME TO WATCH IT?
I STILL WANT TO YOU WATCH IT.
Stephen:  I'LL DO MY BEST. THOMAS FRIEDMAN. "YEARS OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY." SHOWTIME, 8:00 P.M. ON MONDAYS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANKS SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
