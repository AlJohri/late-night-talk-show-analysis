Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, TRUTH BE TOLD, THE THING THAT REALLY HAMMERS MY BANANA ABOUT THIS WHOLE CHRISTIE FLAP IS THAT IT'S ALL JUST A DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL SCANDAL THAT BARACK OBAMA IS A FAILURE. THE FACTS DON'T LIE. AND NOW AT LONG LAST THOSE FACTS ARE BACKED UP BY SOME INFORMATION. IT'S ALL IN FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES NEW MEMOIR.
THE BOOK IS CALLED DUTY
DUTY.
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT DUTY.
Stephen: YES, DUTY IS ON EVERYONE'S LIPS. AND THE BOOK ISN'T EVEN OUT YET. NEXT WEEK IS WHEN THE DUTY DROPS BUT A LITTLE BIT OF DUTY HAS ALREADY LEAKED OUT AND FOR SUCH A SMALL PIECE OF DITY IT'S RAISING QUITE A STINK. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE] JIM.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY HAS SCATHING CRITICISM OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. ROBERT GATES IS HARSHLY QUESTIONING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO THE AFGHANISTAN WAR FROM THE START OF THE SURGE HE ORDERED.
THE FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY DESCRIBES PRESIDENT OBAMA AS DESPERATE TO ABANDON THE WAR EFFORT WRITING, QUOTE, THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T TRUST HIS COMMANDER. CAN'T STAND KARZAI, DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HIS OWN STRATEGY AND DOESN'T CONSIDER THE WAR TO BE HIS. FOR HIM IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING OUT.
Stephen: DOESN'T CONSIDER THE WAR TO BE HIS, OH. PRESIDENT BUSH'S HOUSE, HIS PLANE, HIS HELICOPTER, HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE. BUT HE WANTED TO THROW AWAY BUSH'S WAR THE SAME WAY HE TOSSED OUT HIS OVAL OFFICE HAMBURGER PHONE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HOW HE LOVED TELLING WORLD LEADERS HE WAS JUST CALLING TO KETCHUP. FOLKS, THIS DUTY IS SO EXPLOSIVE, BUT THIS ISN'T SOME PARTISAN HIT JOB. JUST ASK THIS PARTISAN.
ALL THROUGH THE BOOK THERE ARE POSITIVE REFERENCES TO  OBAMA, BALANCED BY THESE SERIOUS CRITICISMS. AND THE POSITIVE REFERENCES GIVE THE CRITICISMS, I THINK, EVEN MORE OOMPH.
Stephen: EVEN MORE OOMPH AND THAT IS SOME COGENT, INCISIVE ANALYSIS FROM RUSH WHICH IS SURPRISING BECAUSE THE MAN'S GOT [BLEEP] FOR BRAINS. AND REMEMBER, REMEMBER, REMEMBER FOLKS, PLEASE, REMEMBER THAT CRITICISM GOT OOMPH BECAUSE I SAID SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT HIM FIRST. AND IT ONLY GETS WORSE. SECRETARY GATES WRITES THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE PRESIDENT'S AFGHANISTAN STRATEGY, "I BELIEVE OBAMA WAS RIGHT IN HIS DECISIONS, BUT I MYSELF, OUR COMMANDERS, AND OUR TROOPS HAD EXPECTED MORE COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSE AND MORE PASSION FOR IT FROM HIM." YES, OBAMA MADE THE RIGHT DECISIONS BUT HE FAKED HIS WAR-GASM. SECRETARY GATES, SECRETARY GATES MUCH PREFERRED PRESIDENT BUSH WHO HAD NO SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT IRAQ INCLUDING OUR DECISION TO INVADE. NO SECOND THOUGHTS. I'M PRETTY SURE HE DIDN'T HAVE FIRST THOUGHTS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S CALLED LEADERSHIP. BOTTOM LINE. (APPLAUSE) BOTTOM LINE, THIS BOOK IS A SCATHING PORTRAIT OF OUR SO-CALLED COMMANDER IN CHIEF. A PRESIDENT WHO OPPOSES OUR INVOLVEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE WITH THAT ATTITUDE. 82% OF AMERICANS.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
