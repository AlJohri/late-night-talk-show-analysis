Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALIST  WHO HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT  PRESIDENT OBAMA CALLED "THE CENTER HOLDS."  YEAHH BUT THE CENTER HOLDS BUT  THE EDGES ARE FRAYING LIKE A SON  OF A BITCH. PLEASE WELCOME JONATHAN ALTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOING DOWN, ALTER.
YOU MIGHT BE GOING DOWN. Stephen: I'M NOT GOING DOWN. MITT ROMNEY WENT DOWN  BECAUSE YOU AND THE LIBERAL  BUDDY BRIGADE WHO ARE CIRCLING THE WAGONS AROUND YOUR FRIEND  OBAMA HAVE NOTHING TO DEFEND  ANYMORE. WE'LL GET TO YOUR FAILURE OF  TRUST IN THIS FRAUD OF A MAN IN  JUST A MOMENT. BUT FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR  GREAT NEW BOOK.
ABSOLUTELY: YES, THE CENTER  HOLDS, OBAMA AND HIS ENEMIES
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE  CENTER HOLDS? ARE YOU SAYING THIS GUY IS A  CENTRIST?
I AM ACTUALLY  Stephen: HE IS NOT A  CENTRIST. A, HE'S A RADICAL SOCIALIST. B, THE CENTER TENDS TO BE, YOU  KNOW, CREAMIER.
SO THIS IS THE FIRST  OOK OUT  ABOUT THE MONUMENTAL  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF 2012.
Stephen: THIS IS THE 2012  ELECTION BOOK.
BUT MORE. THE REASON IT'S CALLEDDTHE  CENTER HOLDS IS IS NOT JUST IN  TRIBUTE TO W.B.H., YOU KNOW, THINGS FALL APART, THE CENTER  CANNOT HOLD, BUT BECAUSE I DO  SEE OBAMA AS WHILE A LITTLE LEFT OF CENTER, HE IS DEFENDING THE  CONSENSUS OF THE 20th  CENTURY THAT GOES BACK TO  FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT >>>Stephen: YOU MEAN... OCIAL SECURITY  tephen: IT'S A FAILURE. IT'S GOING TO FAIL. MEDICARE WE CANNOT PAY FOR IT.
YOU ARE THE RED CAL  Stephen: I'M NOT THE RADICAL. HE IS THE CENTRIST  Stephen: I'M AN ORIGINALIST. I WANT TO GO BACK BEFORE WE HAD  THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT. I WANT TO GO BACK BEFFRE THE  PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT.
YOU ARE QUITE SIMILAR TO PAUL  RYAN
Stephen: IN THAT WE BOTH DO  P-90X.
RYAN AND THE  YAN PLAN  REPRESENTED A RETURN TO A  PRE-NEW DEAL AMERICA. THAT'S WHERE I THOUGHT THE  STAKES WERE SO HIGH. AT THE END FOR ALL OF OBAMA'S  TRULS RIGHT NOW, THE CENTER DID  HOLD. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A  RADICAL RIGHT WING TAKEOVER OF  THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: HOW DID HE GET  RE-ELECTED THOUGH BECAUSE THIS  IS A CONSERVATIVE COUNTRY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. HOW DID HE GET REELECTED?
THERE WAS A DEEP GAP BETWEEN  ROMNEY AND OBAMA
Stephen: WHAT IS THE DEEP
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN HAD THESE  20-SOMETHINGS IN A CAVE
Stephen: A LITERAL CAVE. TO THE OBAMA CAMPAAGN  HEADQUARTERS IN CHICAGO WHERE  THEY WORKED IN SECRET MAKING ALGORITHMS, MODELS.
Stephen: HE LIED ABOUT THAT  TOO. IT'S A SECRET.
HE HAD PROFESSIONAL POKER  PLAYERSS CHILD PROPERTY GEE,  BIOPHYSICISTS AS WELL AS THE DATA SCIENTISTS.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE  LEGION OF  OOM.
IT'S AN AMAZING STOOY BECAUSE  WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WAS TO  MICROTTRGET SO THAT THE CANVASESSERSS THE PEOPLE, MANY  OF WHOM...
Stephen: HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF  EOPLE GOING AROUND  THE COUNTRY.
TWO MILLION  Stephen: THAT'S MANY HUNDREDS  OF THOUSANDS.
THEIR WORK AND THE WAY THEY  CRUSHED ROMNEY...
Stephen: CRUSS IS A STRONG  WORD. CRUSH IS A STRONG WORD. JUST SAY HE LOST AND MOVE ON.
HE LOST BY FIVE MILLION  VOTES. BUT ROMNEY WAS A SELF-DESCRIBED NUMBERS GUY BUT HE WAS RUNNING  WHAT HIS PEOPLE CALLED A MAD MAN  CAMPAIGN OUT OF THEE1960s. HIS GUYS SOME OF THEM WORKED ON  REAAAN'S 1984 CAMPAIGN WHEREAS  IN CHICAGO, YOU HAD THESE GEEKS WHO WERE DESIGNING WAYS TO, FOR  INSTANCE, TAKE ON-LINE FUND  RAISING FROM 15 MILLION A MONTH TO 150 MILLION A MONTH. THEY COMPLETELY CRACKED THE  CODE. THE EMAILS WERE ANNOYING AS  HELL. BUT WHAT THEY...
Stephen: I DID NOT SIGN UP  AND I GOT THEM.
THEY STUDIED THIS. THEY HAD ALL KINDS OF TESTS. THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE BIGGEST  CONCEPTUAL BREAKTHROUGH IN THE  CAMPAIGN AS THE GUY RUNNING THAT DIGITAL TEAM THAT YOU'VE GOT TT  GET OVER YOUR FEAR OF BEING  ANNOYING. ONCE THEY DID, THEY FOUND THAT  THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO  UNSUBSCRIBE WAS MUCH LOWER THAN THE EXTRA MONEY THEY WOULD GET  BY SENDING OUT MORE APPEAL.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND HE'S  GOT LIKE THE GENIUS TEAM THAT  NEVER BEFORE IN THE CAMPAIGN. VERY IMPRESSIVE AND VERY  ORGANIZED AND DRIVEN AND  FOCUSED. WHY CAN HE NOT DO THAT IN HIS  JOB?
WELL, I THINK HE GOT A LOT  MORE ACCOMPLISHED THAN PEOPLE  RECOGNIZE
Stephen: CERTAINLY MORE THAN  I'LL GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR.
OBAMA CARE IS A PRETTY BIG  CHANGE NOT A RADICAL ONE. IT'S A CENTRIST ONE
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY A RADICAL  CHANGE. JONATHAN, I LIKE YOU. YOU'RE A FRIEND BUT YOU'RE  WRONG.
YOU GOT THE CLOCK CLEANED ON  THIS
Stephen: MY CLOCK IS FILTHY.%  YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO EAT OFF MY  CLOCK, SIR. JONATHAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  COMING. JONATHAN ALTER. THE BOOK IS "THE CENTER HOLDS."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
