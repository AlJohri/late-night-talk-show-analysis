( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST IS A ROCK 'N' ROLL LEGEND WHO'S NEWEST RELEASE IS CALLED  "LULLABY AND THE CEASELESS ROAR" I BELIEVE IT'S A CONCEPT ALBUM ABOUT A WHITE NOISE MACHINE. PLEASE WELCOME ROBERT PLANT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOOM, BOOM. COME ON! WHAT -- WHAT'S HAPPENING? ROBERT, GOOD TO SEE YOU. SIT DOWN, MY FRIEND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU NEVER THOUGHT-- I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD START AN INTERVIEW BY SAYING, "I JUST TOUCHED ROBERT PLANT'S BUTT." ROBERT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
IT GOT WARM.
Stephen: I HAVE VERY GENTLE HANDS. ROBERT, MY LIEGE LORD, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HOW HAS YOUR ROCK-TOBER BEEN TREATING YOU?
SO FAR, SO GOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE CAME FROM RECENTLY. ♪ YOU CAME FROM THE LAND OF THE ICE AND SNOW ♪♪ OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CANADA.
YEAH, EXACTLY. SOMEBODY CALLED IT SOMETHING ELSE THE OTHER DAY WHEN WE WERE IN TORONTO BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY. WE CAME FROM JAPAN THROUGH MOROCCO, UP TO ESTONIA-- WE GOT LOST.
Stephen: IS THAT JUST FOR FUN OR IS THAT BUSINESS?
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M STILL ON A MISSION.
Stephen: A MISSION OR A QUEST? BECAUSE I SEE YOU-- YOU'RE A COMMANDER OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE, RIGHT? YOU'RE A C.B. E, RIGHT?
WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT EMPIRES, ARE WE?
Stephen: NOT MUCH ANYMORE, NO, NO. WHAT'S THAT? HOLY-- ( LAUGHTER ) YOU TOOK OUT MY PET FLAG "FLAGWORTH" ARE YOU A KNIGHT ERRANT ON A QUEST?
I DON'T THINK I'M EVER GOING TO MAKE THE FULL GRADE, ACTUALLY, TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH YOU. IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY, AND I THINK C.B. E IS. AS FAR AS I CAN GET.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR HEART? WHAT ABOUT AS AN ARTIST? ARE YOU ON A QUEST OF YOUR OWN?
I THINK I MANAGE TO EAT A LOT OF CEREALS IN THE MORNING.
Stephen: SO YOU HAVE PLENTY OF FIBER, VERY IMPORTANT.
AND IT KEEPS ME REGULARLY MARCHING FORWARD. SO MY QUEST BASICALLY-- I'M GOING TO GET TO THE END OF THIS SOMEHOW OR OTHER-- IT'S A LONG ONE AND HAS NO END. IT'S A WONDERFUL THING TO DO SURROUNDED BY GREAT PEOPLE. I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT FROM THE STOCK ROOM.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT? ( APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT-- LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THIS IS LATER.
OKAY, YEAH.
Stephen: SHALL WE?
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE ACCESSORIES OF BEING NOT QUITE A KNIGHT OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE, BUT ON THE WAY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY LAWYER AND MY NETWORK, THIS IS A CIGARETTE. OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, YOU-- BESIDES BEING A ROCK GOD, BESIDE BEING THE ORIGINAL ROCK GOD, YOU ARE ALSO A-- A HUGE FAN OF POETRY. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE ENGLISH POET OR A STYLE OF POETRY?
YEAH, I THINK WILLIAM BLAKE.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: TIGER, TIGER, BURNING BRIGHT.
YEAH, BUT THE KIND OF GRIP THAT HE HAS, THAT GREAT-- STIRRING THE NATION. STIRRING PEOPLE BY THE FIRESIDE. BEAUTIFUL STUFF, REALLY GREAT.
Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THE ROMANTIC POETS, THE GOTHIC POETS.
I LIKE THE PRE-RAPHAELITE POETS VERY MUCH. YOU'LL FIND THEM ALL INSIDE THAT ALBUM.
Stephen: NICE SEGUEWAY. THE AMBUM ITSELF IS CALLED LULLABY AND THE CEASELESS  ROAR." WHAT IS THE LULLABY? IS THE CEASELESS ROAR THE LULLABY ITSELF?
IT'S ALL LIFE. IT'S THE RICOCHET AND THE THE COLLISION OF ALL THE ADVENTURES I'VE HAD, I SUPPOSE. IT'S TIME TO WRITE SOME OF THEM DOWN.
Stephen: SO THE SEA SHELL ON THE COVER HERE, IS THE CEASELESS ROAR THE SOUND WE HEAR WHEN WE LISTEN TO THE SEA?
IT'S A PARALLEL TO THAT, YEAH. IT'S A PLACE TO TAKE STOCK.
Stephen: I HEARD THAT THAT-- THAT CRASHING WAVE SOUND AND NTHE SEA SHELL IS ACTUALLY US HEARING OUR OWN BLOOD POUNDING IN OUR EARS ECHOED THROUGH THE SHELLS.
THAT'S A RELIEF, ISN'T IT, REALLY?
Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT. I THOUGHT IT WAS MAGIC.
YEAH YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
Stephen: IS THERE A TIME WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN FULL ROBERT PLANT-NESS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, I'M STILL GET-- I'M STILL GETTING THE FULL ROBERT PLANT. IS THERE A CASUAL ROBERT PLANT IN SWEAT PANTS AND FLIP-FLOPS WALKS HIS DOG MAYBE WITH A HANDFUL OF POOP IN A PLASTIC BAG. IS IT OUT THERE SOMEPLACE? DOES IT EXIST?
BACKSTAGE AT THE FILLMORE IN 1970, I THINK.
Stephen: AND THERE WASN'T A DOG.
THERE WAS.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A DOG?
YEAH, I DO.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR DOG'S NAME?
HIS NAME IS ARTHUR. AND HE'S THE FUTURE DOG.
Stephen: IF YOU COULD BE A CHARACTER FROM AN ARTHURIAN LEGEND, WHO WOULD YOU BE? WOULD YOU BE ARTHUR, LANCE LOT.
I WOULD BE DERVELE. HE IS THE ONLY GUY-- YOU READY TO HAVE A LITTLE SNOOZE?
Stephen: ALWAYS.
HE'S THE ONLY GUY ACTUALLY WRITTEN ABOUT FROM THE LAST BATTLE BEFORE HE TELEPORTED OFF WITH THE THREE CHICKS.
Stephen: ON THE BOAT.
DERVELE SURVIVED AND HE WENT ON TO BE SOMEWHERE IN A MONASTERY ON THE WELSH BORDER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: YOU WANT TO BE HIM BECAUSE HE LIVES?
HE LOST HIS RIGHT HAND, BUT HE HAD A LEFT ONE. HE KEPT GOING.
Stephen: ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE A SPARE. WELL, ROBERT, WOULD YOU ROCK US OUT?
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT THAT. AM I EQUIPPED?
Stephen: WE HAVE A TAMBOURINE. WHAT MORE NEED YOU?
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. ROBERT PLANT. THE ALBUM IS "LULLABY AND THE CEASELESS ROAR." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
