[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH  THING AS A FREE LUNCH. SO THERE MIGHT BE, AFTER I  SHAMELESSLY PLUG DELICIOUS  LUNCHABLES LIKE THE NAME SAYS THEY ARE ABLE TO BE LUNCH  THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD. NATION, NOWHERE IS THE  NANNY-STATE MORE RAMPANT THAN  NEW YORK CITY, WHERE MAYOR BLOOM-JERK-- TRADEMARK-- HAS  BEEN CURTAILING FOOD FREEDOMS. FIRST, HE BANNED TRANS-FATS,  THEN HE PUT CALORIE COUNTS ON  MENUS, AND NOW STARTING ON MARCH 12th, YOU WON'T BE ALLOWED TO  ORDER A 2-LITER SODA WITH YOUR  PIZZA DELIVERY. THAT'S A LOT LESS WEIGHT TO  CARRY FOR THE DELIVERY GUY, WHO  IS THE ONLY PERSON IN THIS SCENARIO GETTING ANY EXERCISE. [LAUGHTER] BLOOMBERG IS ACTING LIKE  AMERICANS CAN'T CONTROL WHAT  GOES INTO THEIR OWN MOUTHS. WELL, HE'S WRONG-- WE CAN  CONTROL OUR MOUTHS. OR AT LEAST SNACK FOOD  SCIENTISTS CAN. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE LAST WEEK "THE NEW YORK  TIMES" REPORTED THAT THE  NACHO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HAS DISCOVERED SOMETHING CALLED  "THE BLISS POINT," AN ADDICTIVE  COMBINATION OF FLAVORS THAT CREATE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF  CRAVE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT  IN FOOD SCIENCE SINCE AMERICA  PUT A MAN ON A BEANBAG CHAIR, AND GAVE HIM A TUBE OF COOKIE  DOUGH. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS ONE SMALL NAP FOR MAN. NO  STEPS AT ALL OF ANY KIND. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A RECENT BREAKTHROUGH IS THAT  DORITOS HAS DEVELOPED A COMPLEX  FORMULA THAT PIQUES THE TASTE BUDS ENOUGH TO BE ALLURING  WITHOUT A DISTINCT, OVERRIDING  SINGLE FLAVOR THAT TELLS THE BRAIN TO STOP EATING. YES, DORITOS HAS ENGINEERED  CHIPS SO THAT YOU KEEP SHOVELING  THEM IN YOUR MOUTH WITHOUT EVER FEELING SATISFIED. WHICH EXPLAINS THEIR NEW FLAVOR:  BLAZIN BUFFALO BOTTOMLESS PIT OF  UNFULFILLED LONGING. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, THIS KIND OF FLAVOR-BASED  BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION MAY WORK  ON YOUR CASUAL SNACKER, BUT NO SNACK COMPANY IS GONNA MAKE ME  THEIR BITCH. [LAUGHTER] SO SCREW THE BLISS POINT! I'M GOING TO PROVE TO THE WORLD,  AND MAYOR BLOOMBERG, THAT I CAN  EAT A SINGLE TOSTITO SCOOP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JIM, SNACK MUSIC PLEASE. ♪ ♪  ♪ YOU ARE THE BEST ♪  ♪ ♪  YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M IN SUCH  CONTROL HERE, I WILL CHOOSE TO HAVE ONE MORE SCOOP. [LAUGHTER] THEY ARE SCOOPS. I'LL HAVE IT WITH SOME DIP. HIT IT, JIMMY. ♪ YOU ARE THE BEST ♪  ♪ ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
