Stephen: (SCREAMING) TONIGHT, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAN. DAMN, GEORGE BUSH WAS OFF BY JUST ONE LETTER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A NEW VACATION SPOT FOR THE WEALTHY. IT'S HARD TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL WHEN YOU OWN IT ALL. AND MY GUEST DAVID CHRISTIAN HAS A NEW T.V. SHOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD. EVERYTHING? WHAT ELSE YA GOT? (LAUGHTER) LADY GAGA SAYS SHE'S ADDICTED TO POT. SO BE ON THE LOOKOUT IN CASE SHE STARTS EXHIBITING ANY ODD BEHAVIOR. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. FOLKS, CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? PLEASE, CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? (LAUGHTER) I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE. I DON'T LIKE BARACK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) THERE, I SAID IT. WHERE DO I FIND THE COURAGE? I TELL YOU WHY, FOLKS, THE MAN IS A LIAR. REMEMBER HOW HE SOLD US OBAMACARE?
IF YOU LIKE YOUR INSURANCE PLAN, YOU WILL KEEP IT.
Stephen: BUT NOW MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR COVERAGE RIPPED FROM THEM. I BELIEVE IT'S THE PLOT OF "TAKEN 3." (LAUGHTER) FIRST IT WAS HIS DAUGHTER, THEN HIS WIFE, NOW THEY'VE TAKEN HIS HEALTH PLAN. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS. YES, I'LL HOLD. WELL, FOLKS, WE FINALLY GOT THE HARD NUMBERS ON OBAMACARE'S DISASTROUS FIRST MONTH. STOP, HEMMER TIME.
FOX'S ALERT NOW. WE GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT THE OBAMACARE ENROLL. NUMBERS AND THIS HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. "WALL STREET JOURNAL" REPORTS FEWER THAN 50,000 AMERICANS SUCCESSFULLY SIGNED UP.
Stephen:   50,000! TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS FEWER PEOPLE THAN WATCH "UP LATE" WITH ALEC BALDWIN. (LAUGHTER) JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, FOLKS. THERE ARE 48 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS. THAT COMES OUT TO A .1% ACCEPTANCE RATE. SO OBAMACARE IS 58 TIMES HARDER TO GET INTO THAN HARVARD! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, TO GET INTO OBAMACARE YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO ACE YOUR M.R.I.s. (LAUGHTER) I HAD NO IDEA OBAMACARE WAS GOING TO BE THIS EXCLUSIVE. WHICH KIND OF MAKES ME WANT IN. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, I'LL JOIN ANYTHING THAT WON'T HAVE ME. LET ME IN, EARTH, WIND & FIRE. I CAN BE MOISTURE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ DO YOU REMEMBER, T WORDS TO THIS SONG, LA, LA, LA ♪ (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, OBAMACARE IS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLY HIP CLUB THAT COVERS YOUR RIP REPLACEMENT. SO COME ON, OBAMA, THERE'S GOT TO BE A V.I.P. LIST. I TRIED SHOWING UP TO THE WEB SITE WITH TWO MODELS AND A BAG OF COKE. BUT ALL I GOT WAS TWO COKED UP MODELS! (LAUGHTER) GOD, THEY NEED SOME HEALTH CARE. I'LL JUST KEEP TRYING, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE DO NOT FIX THE WEB SITE. I WOULDN'T WANT THIS EXCLUSIVE CLUB TO BE RUINED BY A BUNCH OF POOR PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, I BELIEVE THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN OBAMA'S WEB SITE IS HIS LACK OF FORESIGHT. NOW, OUR NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN IN CHIEF LOVES SURRENDERING TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND THIS WEEKEND HE SENT SECRETARIAT OF STATE JOHN KERRY TO WAVE THE WHITE FLAG AT IRAN.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY IS IN SWITZERLAND TO NEGOTIATE A POSSIBLE BREAK THROUGH TO FREEZE IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THE UNITED STATES IS LARGELY LOOKING FOR IRAN TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN CURBING ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITY.
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS REPORTEDLY PREPARED TO OFFER THE IRANIANS LIMITED RELIEF FROM CRIPPLING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IF THEY AGREE TO TEMPORARILY HALT THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS.
Stephen: SIX MONTHS! YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH TERRORISTS THAT LAST SIX MONTHS-- UNLESS YOU'RE RAISING THE DEBT CEILING. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IRAN IS A NATION OF RADICAL MUSLIMS HELL BENT ON ACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WE CAN'T HAVE NUKES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. SOMEONE MIGHT BOMB ISRAEL AND THEN THEY'D HAVE TO USE THEIR NUKES! (LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY, THE DEAL WAS STOPPED BY OUR CLOSEST ALLY.
FRANCE SAYS FORGET IT, NO DEAL.
THE FRENCH JUST SAID LOOK, PAUSE, FORGET IT. WE WANT TO HALT THE ENTIRE PROGRAM.
FRANCE WAS THE COUNTRY TO STAND UP AND SAY NO TO THIS. THEY SAID THE DEAL WAS TOO EASY ON TEHRAN.
Stephen: YES, FRANCE! THE COUNTRY THAT PUT THE OUI IN "WE GIVE UP." (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, OF THE SIX-NATION TEAM -- WE LOVE IT. WE LOVE FRANCE. (LAUGHTER) OF THE SIX-NATION TEAM NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN, ONLY FRANCE HAD THE ESCARGOTS TO SAY NON AND YOU KNOW IT WAS A BAND DEAL IF FRANCE IS TURNING DOWN A SIX-WAY. (LAUGHTER) FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER AND BUTLER IN A GREY POUPON AD LAURIENT FABIUS SAID "THE AGREEMENT WAS TOO EASY ON TEHRAN. ONE WANTS A DEAL BUT NOT A SUCKER'S DEAL." AND, FOLKS, FRANCE KNOW'S A SUCKER'S DEAL. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SOLD US LOUISIANA. (LAUGHTER) WE SHOULD HAVE SAVED THE RECEIPT. NOW OUR PRESIDENT'S BEEN OUTTOUGHED BUT THE FRENCH. THAT'S LIKE BEING OUTSOBERRED BY TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. WE STAND WITH YOU, MR. MAYOR. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE PRAISING THE FRENCH HERE. ARIZONA SENATOR AND "BOMB, BOMB IRAN" LEAD VOCALIST JOHN McCAIN TWEETED "FRANCE HAD THE COURAGE TO PREVENT A BAD NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN. VIVE LA FRANCE." UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO HIS INEXPERIENCE WITH TWITTER HE ACCIDENTALLY TYPED THIS INTO HIS MICROWAVE. (LAUGHTER) NATION, YOU KNOW IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW I'VE BEEN TOUGH ON FRANCE IN THE PAST. IT'S A MIRACLE THEY SURVIVED THE HUMILIATION THAT WAS FREEDOM FRIES. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK FROM THAT ONE BUT I THINK IT'S TIME TO SHOW THEM OUR GRATITUDE SO PEOPLE OF FRANCE IN HONOR OF YOUR BRAVERY FROM NOW ON THIS SHALL BE NOBODY AS FRENCH CHEESE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU'RE WELCOME, FRANCE. IT AGES -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT AGES BEAUTIFULLY, A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW IT WILL TASTE EXACTLY THE SAME. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW THAT FRANCE HAS SAVED THE WORLD, WE MUST NEVER, EVER GO BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE WITH IRAN. HERE TO TELL ME WHY WE MUST GO BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE WITH IRAN IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL IRANIAN AMERICAN COUNCIL TRITA PARSI. MR. PARSI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT, OKAY. SIR, YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF "A SINGLE ROLL OF THE DICE." ABOUT WHY AMERICA MUST GET BACK TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH IRAN. BUT WHY, SIR, HAVEN'T WE DODGED A BULLET BY WALKING AWAY FROM THE POWER-MAD MULLAHS WHO WANT TO BOMB ISRAEL AND WIPE IT OFF THE MAP?
ACTUALLY, WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS DOING IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS WAS A HUGE FAVOR TO ISRAEL BECAUSE IF THE DEAL HAD GONE THROUGH, IF THE FRENCH HAD NOT CHANGED TO GO FORTH IN THE LAST MINUTE THERE WOULD BE A CLOSING OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IRANIANS TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND THAT WOULD HELP ISRAEL'S SECURITY AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE'S SECURITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AMERICA'S SECURITY.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO CALL BULL (BLEEP) ON YOU TWO WAYS HERE. (LAUGHTER) FIRST OF ALL, THE FRENCH CAN'T MOVE GOALPOSTS, THEY DON'T PLAY FOOTBALL. THEY PLAY WHAT THEY CALL F,TBOL. ANYWAYS, THE SECOND SOMETHING HOW ARE WE HELPING ISRAEL? HOW ARE WE STOPPING IRAN FROM GETTING A BOMB BECAUSE ALL QUESTION IS IS FOR A REDUCTION IN THEIR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES. IN EXCHANGE WE GIVE THEM SIX MONTHS OF CASH, SELL THEIR OIL, UNFREEZE THEIR ACCOUNTS. SIX MONTHS FROM NOW THEY SAY, HEY, THANKS FOR THE CASH WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO BUILDING OUR BOMB. ISRAEL, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, THEY GET TO BLAME US.
NOT AT ALL. HERE'S WHY YOU'RE WRONG.
NO, ABSOLUTELY YES. (LAUGHTER)
HERE'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN INTERIM DEAL IN ORDER TO REACH A LATER DEAL WHEN THE FINAL AGREEMENT WERE TO BE NEGOTIATED.
Stephen: BUT THAT THAT'S TRUSTING ROUHANI, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S TRUSTING? IT'S TRUSTING THE AGREEMENT. THE AGREEMENT THAT VERIFY IT IS OTHER SIDE IS NOT CHEATING. IT'S NOT ABOUT TRUSTING THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS ONE. MORE IMPORTANTLY --
Stephen: HOW CAN WE TRUST ANY AGREEMENT WITH THESE PEOPLE. THEY HAVEN'T EVEN RELEASED THE HOSTAGES YET. IT'S DAY 12,428. LET BEN AFFLECK GO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE SANCTIONS ARE WORKING. THE POINT IS THE SANCTIONS ARE WORKING AREN'T THEY?
I WOULD SAY NO, THE SANCTIONS ARE WORKING IN THE SENSE OF DESTROYING THE ECONOMY OF THE IRANIANS.
Stephen: BUT THEY WOULDN'T BE COMING TO THE BARGAINING TABLE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SANCTIONS!
THIS WAS THE SAME TEAM THAT IN 2005 OFFERED TO CAP THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM AT 3,000 CENTRIFUGES. TODAY THEY HAVE 19,000. WHAT THE DEAL WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED IS REMARKABLE BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS THAT THE PROGRAM-- ESSENTIAL PARTS OF IT-- WOULD HAVE BEEN FROZEN. THAT'S CRITICAL.
Stephen: ARE THE SANCTIONS HURTING THEM?
THEY ARE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CARROT-AND-STICK APPROACH. YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, SAY WE'LL STOP HITTING YOU WITH THE STOCK AND WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT YOU STAB THEM WITH THE CARROT! (LAUGHTER) SO -- BUT THEY WANT A BOMB, RIGHT? WE KNOW THEY WANT A BOMB.
ACTUALLY, U.S. INTELLIGENCE IS SAYING THAT THEY ARE PREPARING TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER IN ORDER TO HAVE THE OPTION OF BUILDING A BOMB. BUT THEY HAVE NOT MADE A DECISION TO GO THERE TO BUILD A BOMB AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN DO AND A LOT THAT THIS DEAL WOULD HAVE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT OPTION ALSO WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. UNTIL THE FRENCH SHOWED UP.
Stephen: OKAY, NOW LISTEN. YOU ARE IRANIAN OR AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
I WAS BORN IN IRAN, I'M A SWEDISH CITIZEN.
Stephen: YOU'RE A SWEDISH CITIZEN. WELL, I DON'T TRUST THOSE BASTARDS, EITHER. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU'RE NOT AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
I'M A GREEN CARD HOLDER.
Stephen: OKAY, I'VE SEEN "HOMELAND." SPOILER ALERT: THERE'S NO REASON TO TRUST YOU.
YOU QUESTION LOYALTY AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE PRAISE THE FRENCH WHEN THEY'RE CELEBRATING A SETBACK IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.
NO, THEY'RE HOLDING THE LINE AGAINST THE MULLAHS -- ANYONE WHOSE FLAG HAS RED WHITE AND BLUE ON IT, MY FRIEND. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. TRITA PARSI, THE NATIONAL IRANIAN AMERICAN COUNCIL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
