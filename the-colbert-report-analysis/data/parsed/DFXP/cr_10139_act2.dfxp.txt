STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK! WELCOME BACK TO OUR NIXON RESIGNATION SPECIAL. TO TRULY "KNOW" AN HISTORICAL FIGURE LIKE NIXON, IT HELPS TO ACTUALLY KNOW HIM. MY NEXT GUEST DID. PLEASE WELCOME FORMER NIXON SPEECHWRITER AND AUTHOR OF "THE GREATEST COMEBACK:  HOW RICHARD NIXON ROSE FROM DEFEAT TO CREATE THE NEW MAJORITY," PAT BUCHANAN. PAT, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN! ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON "THE REPORT"!
THANK YOU! (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: PAT, YOU KNEW RICHARD NIXON. YOU WERE ONE OF HIS SPEECHWRITERS. PEOPLE SEE HIM AS A TRAGIC FIGURE IN MANY WAYS.
RIGHT.
STEPHEN: WHO WAS THE NIXON YOU KNEW? WAS HE A TRAGIC FIGURE?
YEAH, HE WAS, IN A WAY. NIXON HAD SOME FLAWS, AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES' FLAWS ARE MAGNIFIED AS IN MANY CASES, IT'S A TRAGEDY, AND HE WAS INDECISIVE IN WATERGATE, TOO LOYAL TO HIS FRIENDS, AND HE DIDN'T ACT AND IF HE DID, HE WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST  PRESIDENTS. ARMS CONTROL, OPENED UP CHINA, SAVED ISRAEL IN THE WAR, BROUGHT TROOPS HOME FROM VIETNAM, BROUGHT P.O.W.'S HOME, AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS BUT WATERGATE ERASED IT ALL.
40 YEARS AGO TODAY THE SMOKING GUN TAPE WAS RELEASED.
I WAS AT CAMP DAVID AND WE FOUND IT.
STEPHEN: TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT THE SMOKING GUN WAS.
THE SMOKING GUN TAPE WAS FROM JUNE 3, 1972 WHERE RICHARD NIXON WAS TALKING BASICALLY ABOUT CONTAINING THE INVESTIGATION OF WATERGATE. IT WAS A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER IT AND NIXON HAD SEEN THE TAPES AND SAID HE HAD NOT TALKED, HAD BASICALLY NOT BEEN DISCUSSING THE SO-CALLED COVERUP THEN. WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN WE FOUND IT AT CAMP DAVID WE RELEASED IT THE NEXT DAY AND DROPPED THE BOTTOM OUT OF --
STEPHEN: THE TAPE SAID HE KNEW THERE WAS A COVERUP AND HE WAS ENCOURAGING THE COVERUP?
THE TAPE SAID THERE WAS A COVERUP AND HE KNEW ABOUT IT. THE PROBLEM WAS HE HAD NOT SPOKEN THE TRUTH.
STEPHEN: SHOULD HE HAVE DESTROYED THE TAPES?
HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TAPES.
STEPHEN: BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, OKAY, SHOULD YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE MURDER WEAPON? WELL, BETTER NOT TO MURDER SOMEONE. (LAUGHTER) DID YOU ADVISE HIM TO DESTROY THE TAPES?
YES, I DID.
STEPHEN: I AGREE WITH YOU. IF YOU'RE GOING TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE, GO ALL THE WAY (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
NO, NO! HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE DEAD WRONG. HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. WHEN THE TAPES WERE REVEALED, NOT A SINGLE ONE HAD BEEN SUBPOENAED. THEY WERE NOT EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING. HE HAD TAKEN TAPES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NOT KNOWN IT, THE TAPES OPERATED AUTOMATICALLY AND WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS KEPT THE TAPES OF BREZHNEV AND THE FOREIGN POLICY AND JOHN DEAN AND TAKE THE REST AND GET RID OF THEM.
STEPHEN: BECAUSE THEY HAD EVIDENCE OF HIS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
AFTER BURNING HIM HE COULD HAVE SAID GO AHEAD AND IMPEACH AND BE DAMNED.
STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T HE STICK OUT THE IMPEACHMENT. HE'S MY PRESIDENT. I WAS A KID WHEN HE RESIGNED AND I ALWAYS FELT HE WAS MY PRESIDENT.
HE DIDN'T STICK IT OUT BECAUSE THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VOTED TO IMPEACH. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES IN THE HOUSE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE SENATE AND THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AFTER FIVE OR SIX MONTHS. THOSE AT CAMP DAVID SAID WE CANNOT PUT THE COUNTRY THROUGH THIS WHEN WE KNOW THE END IS NOT IN DOUBT. BARRY GOLDWATER AND OTHERS CAME DOWN, BUT RICHARD ALREADY SAID DON'T PUT THE COUNTRY THROUGH IT, END IT AND PUT GERALD FORD IN OFFICE, WHICH WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
STEPHEN: THERE'S AN IMAGE OF NIXON AS A PARANOID, UNHAPPY PERSON. WHAT WAS HAPPY NIXON LIKE? WHAT MADE HIM HAPPY?
I'LL TELL YOU A STORY. I WAS 14 YEARS OLD WHEN I MET HIM. HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I WAS ON THE CADDY BENCH OF THE BURNING TREE COUNTRY CLUB, ALL MEN'S CLUB, EISENHOWER GOLF THERE. HE CAME OUT THERE AND WAS WITH THE GUYS OUT THERE ON THE GOLF COURSE AND HE WAS IN HIS MADE 40S. HE WAS A GENUINELY HAPPY MAN. HE LOVED THE BATTLE, THE POLITICAL BATTLE. WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR HIM UP THERE AT HIS LAW FIRM, HE CALLED ME IN AND WE TALKED FOR HOURS EVERY DAY AND HE SAID IF I HAD TO PRACTICE LAW FOR A LIVING, I WOULD BE MENTALLY DEAD IN TWO YEARS AND PHYSICALLY IN FOUR. WHAT HE LOVED WAS THE BATTLE, BRINGING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BACK FROM THAT HORRENDOUS DEFEAT IN '64, HIS OWN RUINED CAREER AND MARCHING UP THE HILL TO WHERE HE WON THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE GREATEST LANDSLIDE IN AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY.
STEPHEN: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT "THE GREATEST COMEBACK" THIS IS BETWEEN '62 AND '68 WHEN HE'S IN THE WILDERNESS FROM CALIFORNIA AND BECOMES THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, NOT ONLY DID HE REHABILITATE HIMSELF AFTER WATERGATE BUT HE REHABILITATED HIMSELF BEFORE HE BECAME PRESIDENT. THIS MAN RESURRECTED HIS CAREER TWICE. EVEN JESUS ONLY DID IT ONCE.
THREE TIMES. YOU MENTIONED THE CHECKERS SPEECH
STEPHEN: SO HE'S THE FATHER, SON AND THE HOLY GHOST! (APPLAUSE) PAT BUCHANAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. "THE GREATEST COMEBACK "  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
