Stephen: HELLO, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO THE REPORT! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD! I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE JOINING US, ALL THE PEOPLE HERE. I DON'T KNOW ALL YOUR NAMES OTHER THAN LAUREN MASTERSON -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TRY. FOLKS, TONIGHT WE'RE ALL HAPPY AND I WISH I COULD COME TO YOU WITH GOOD NEWS, BUT THE WORST IMAGINABLE THING THAT HAPPENED -- MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO GET HEALTHCARE... (LAUGHTER) JIM?
THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED 7,041,000 PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR COVERAGE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THEY'VE REACHED THEIR ANTICIPATED GOAL OF 7 MILLION.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS CLAIMING VICTORY IN ITS LONG, PAINFUL STRUGGLE TO SIGN UP CONSUMERS FOR HEALTH CARE.
7.1 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE NOW SIGNED UP FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS THROUGH THESE MARKETPLACES. 7.1.
Stephen: 7.1 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR OBAMA CARE. NOW WHEN I GO TO MY DOCTOR'S OFFICE, THERE WILL BE 7.1 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE WAITING ROOM AHEAD OF ME. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M SORRY, FOLKS -- AND THE HIGHLIGHTS MAZE STOPS BEING CHALLENGING AFTER YOU'VE DONE IT THE FIRST TEN TIMES! FOLKS, THEY WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT TO 7 MILLION.
2 MILLION PEOPLE TO SIGN UP AND TEN DAYS TO GO.
THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM GETTING TO THAT PLACE IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY.
WE CALL IT "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE."
THEY'LL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE UNDER 4.5 MILLION.
THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE CLOSE. IT JUST AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: I JUST DON'T SEE HOW COULD KARL ROVE AND HIS LIFE PARTNER BOARDY BE WRONG? (LAUGHTER) AFTER ALL, THEY'RE THE MATHEMATICAL WIZARDS THAT CALLED OHIO FOR ROMNEY! IT WAS ONLY LOGICAL. IF NO ONE "HAD" SIGNED UP, NO ONE "WOULD" SIGN UP. BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS PAST PERFORMANCE ALWAYS INDICATES FUTURE RESULTS. THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS PLAY YESTERDAY'S WINNING LOTTO NUMBERS. (LAUGHTER) AND MAY I POINT OUT, I'VE NEVER LOST -- YESTERDAY'S LOTTO. BUT NOW THIS LAST MINUTE SIGNUP SURGE HAS COMPLETELY RAINED ON OUR PARADE. SERIOUSLY, WE HAD TO CANCEL THE PARADE. AND I HAD TO SCRAP MY PLANS FOR "STEPHEN COLBERT'S ROCKIN' EROLLMENT FAILURE EVE," WHERE ME, RYAN SEACREST AND T.I. WERE GOING TO COUNT DOWN ON A GIANT CLOCK UNTIL THEY DROPPED AN UNINSURED PERSON IN TIMES SQUARE. (LAUGHTER) THEN WE DON'T TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL 'CAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE. APPARENTLY, THIS LAST-MINUTE HEALTH-SCRAMBLE WAS ALL THANKS TO YOUNG ADULTS SIGNING UP AT HIGHER RATES. NO ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN THAT COLLEGE KIDS WOULD PUT SOMETHING OFF UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE! (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS, MAYBE THERE'S A SILVER LINING HERE. YES, THE ADMINISTRATION HIT THEIR GOAL OF 7 MILLION. BUT IS THERE ANY WAY TO SAY THEY DIDN'T?
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF KEY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED ABOUT HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING WHO SIGNED UP FOR IT. YOUNGER HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY FOR OLDER SICKER PEOPLE? AND DID EVERYONE WHO ENROLLED PAY FOR COVERAGE?
HOW MANY DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE BEFORE?
HOW MANY ARE YOUNG?
HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE PAID?
Stephen: YEAH, HOW MANY ARE YOUNG? HOW MANY HAVE PAID? WHAT IF THEIR CHECK DOESN'T CLEAR? WHAT ARE NUMBERS BUT ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCTS? AND DID YOU KNOW THESE ARE ARABIC NUMERALS?! I MEAN, THE "3" IS JUST TWO ISLAMIC CRESCENT MOONS STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER! THE TERRORISTS HAVE WON! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SPOOKY STUFF! AND SPEAKING OF TERRORISTS -- BARACK OBAMA! THIS MAN STOOD IN THE PEOPLE'S ROSE GARDEN TODAY AND MADE OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS ABOUT REPUBLICANS.
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS HERE TO STAY. AND THOSE WHO HAVE BASED THEIR ENTIRE POLITICAL AGENDA ON REPEALING IT, THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE COUNTRY, WHY JEANIE SHOULD GO BACK TO BEING UNINSURED? I GOT TO ADMIT, I DON'T GET IT. WHY ARE FOLKS WORKING SO HARD FOR PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE?
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? THAT'S DIRTY POLITICS! IF VOTERS BELIEVE THE G.O.P. WANTS TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTH INSURANCE, THEN REPUBLICANS WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE SENATE IN NOVEMBER. AND THEN HOW WILL THEY TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTH INSURANCE? SO, TO WIN THE MID-TERMS IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME STRAIGHT TALK. WE CONSERVATIVES MUST LOOK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE EYE AND SAY... APRIL FOOL'S! (LAUGHTER) GOTCHA! GOTCHA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: COME ON! FIGHTING OBAMA CARE WAS A FOUR-YEAR PRANK! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOUGHT IT. WHY WOULD WE BE THE ONLY WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED NATION WITHOUT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE? (SLIDE WHISTLE) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THIS IS PRICELESS! OH, YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACE!... SERIOUSLY, YOU GOT A GROWTH THERE. I'D HAVE A DOCTOR CHECK THAT OUT. NATION, MARCH MADNESS HAS NEARLY COME TO A CLOSE, WHICH MEANS WE'LL SOON LEARN WHICH FINAL FOUR TEAM HAS WON THE CHAMPIONS' RIGHT TO SET FIRE TO EVERY CAR ON CAMPUS. (LAUGHTER) BUT ENJOY THE ACTION WHILE YOU CAN, BECAUSE SOON, COLLEGE SPORTS AS WE KNOW IT WILL BE OVER.
IT'S JUST A FIRST STEP, BUT THERE WAS A REMARKABLE RULING TODAY THAT COULD REVOLUTIONIZE COLLEGE SPORTS. A REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD RULED THAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO RECEIVE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS QUALIFY AS EMPLOYEES AND MAY LEGALLY UNIONIZE.
Stephen: UNIONIZE?! PLAYERS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO WANT MONEY. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF SELLING SPONSORSHIP TO TOSTITOS. (LAUGHTER) AND THEY MADE THIS DECISION FOR THE WORST POSSIBLE REASON.
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD IN CHICAGO HAD ITS REGIONAL DIRECTOR BASE THE DECISION ON THE CONTROL THE COACHES HAVE OVER THE LIVES OF SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES TO FIND THAT PLAYERS SPEND 50 TO 60 HOURS PER WEEK ENGAGING IN FOOTBALL-RELATED ACTIVITIES. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF CONTROL AN EMPLOYER HAS OVER AN EMPLOYEE.
Stephen: OH, RIDICULOUS! NORTHWESTERN PLAYERS AREN'T EMPLOYEES OF THE UNIVERSITY -- THEY DON'T GET "PAID." TECHNICALLY, THEY'RE "SLAVES" OF THE UNIVERSITY. (LAUGHTER) THE FIVE'S ERIC BOLLING KNOWS THE NIGHTMARE  WE'LL BE STUCK WITH AFTER UNIONS TAKE HOLD.
CAN YOU IMAGINE, JUST TAKE THIS ONE STEP FURTHER. A FOOTBALL TEAM IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER DOING DOUBLES WHEN IT'S HOT? A PLAYER GOES, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS AGAINST MY LABOR BOARD RELATIONS. HERE IT IS. RIGHT HERE. I HAVE THIS DOCUMENT THAT SAYS I CAN'T RUN IN 100-DEGREE HEAT.
Stephen: YEAH, UNIONS WILL TURN OUR PLAYERS INTO WIMPS. YOU GOTTA BE TOUGH! YOU DON'T HEAR THE MASCOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE HEAT, MOSTLY BECAUSE HE PASSED OUT HOURS AGO INSIDE HIS PUMA SUIT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT THE N.C.-DOUBLE-ALLIGATORS BEHIND THIS CAMPAIGN LIKE FORMER NORTHWESTERN QUARTERBACK KAIN COLTER REFUSE TO BACK DOWN.
STUDENT ATHLETES DON'T HAVE A VOICE. THEY DON'T HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THE CURRENT MODEL RESEMBLES A DICTATORSHIP.
Stephen: DICTATORSHIP? THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. HOW IS GATHERING IN A STADIUM TO CHANT IN UNISON AS UNIFORMED MEN MOVE IN FORMATION LIKE A DICTATORSHIP? (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT THESE CLEAT-BOOTED THUGS ARE DEMANDING.
COLTER SAYS ATHLETES ARE MISSING OUT ON FULLY-FUNDED ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS, DUE PROCESS FOR ALLEGED NCAA VIOLATIONS, AND GUARANTEED COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR CURRENT AND FORMER PLAYERS.
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE OUR LIVES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTED.
Stephen: YOU ARE PROTECTED... THAT'S WHAT THE CUP IS FOR. (LAUGHTER) AND MEDICAL COVERAGE IS A BURDEN THESE SCHOOLS CAN'T AFFORD. YES, COLLEGE ATHLETES HELP GENERATE MORE THAN $16 BILLION IN TELEVISION CONTRACTS. BUT HAVE YOU BEEN TO A COLLEGE CAFETERIA? THERE'S UNLIMITED CEREAL! YOU CAN KISS THAT GOODBYE NOW. NOW I HEAR THAT NORTHWESTERN GRADUATES SOME QUALITY PEOPLE WITH EXCELLENT EDUCATIONS. BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM. HOW CAN YOU EXPECT TO KEEP ATHLETES IN LINE WHEN YOU'RE OFFERING CLASSES LIKE ECON 3 39 - LABOR ECONOMICS? TIME TO REPLACE THAT WITH SOMETHING MORE APPROPRIATE TO FOOTBALL, LIKE BIO-104, INTRO TO SKULL TRAUMA. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WHAT ARE THESE PLAYER UNION PEOPLE THINKING? WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL FIND OUT FROM THE HEAD OF THE COLLEGE ATHLETES PLAYERS ASSOCIATION, RAMOGI HUMA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
