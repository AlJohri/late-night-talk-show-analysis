Stephen: MIDTERMS 014: DETOUR TO GRIDLOCK. AN EXCITING THING THAT I AM TOTALLY INTERESTED IN. WAIT, DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL! LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF A DUCKLING FOLLOWING A CAT DRESSED LIKE  A SHARK RIDING A ROOMBA! 014 (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANKS, FOLKS! WE'VE GOT TO DO THE SHOW. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR YOUR HEROISM THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN HERE AND OUT THERE FOR THIS AN HISTORIC NIGHT, THE 2014 MIDTERM ELECTIONS! NO ELECTION HAS EVER BEEN MORE MID-PORTANT. SO MANY QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED, WILL THE SENATE CHANGE HANDS? WILL THE G.O.P. TIGHTEN ITS GRIP ON THE HOUSE? DID ANY ONE VOTE? BUT WHAT REALLY MAKES THIS EVENING SO AN-HISTORIC IS  IT'S MY LAST ELECTION NIGHT SPECIAL. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AS YOU  KNOW, I'M GOING OFF THE AIR NEXT MONTH TO PURSUE MY DREAM OF NEVER COVERING THE MIDTERMS AGAIN. AND TONIGHT I'M COMING TO YOU LIVE! SEE, IT SAYS RIGHT UP THERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
RIGHT UP THERE IN THE CORNER IT SAYS "LIVE," RIGHT UP THERE ON THE SCREEN. THOUGH FROM MY SIDE OF THE SCREEN IT ACTUALLY SPELLS "EVIL" (LAUGHTER) THAT'S KIND OF CREEPY. JIMMY, CAN WE CHANGE THAT TO SOMETHING LESS SPOOKY FROM MY SIDE LIKE RED RUM? THAT'S BETTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLKS, YOU WILL NOTICE TONIGHT'S SHOW IS MORE URGENT, MORE INTENSE, MORE PAST MY BEDTIMEY. SO TO KEEP ME SHARP   I AM HOPPED UP ON AN AMERICAN FLAG COLORED SPEED BALL OF RED BULL, METH AND VIAGRA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT THE STAKES ARE HIGH AND SO AM I! IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL! BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE POISED TO TAKE BACK THE SENATE! GOING  INTO TONIGHT, THERE WERE 45 SAFE DEMOCRAT SEATS AND 47 SAFE REPUBLICAN SEATS, LEAVING 8 KEY STATES WITH COMPETITIVE RACES. IF THE G.O.P. PICKED UP ANY FOUR OF THESE STATES, THEY CONTROL THE SENATE MAJORITY. IF NOT, THEY'LL SIMPLY CONTINUE TO CONTROL THE SENATE FROM THE MINORITY. AND WE HAVE RESULTS. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SEEMS INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT AND WORLD'S SHORTEST POEM JEANNE SHAHEEN HAS DEFEATED FORMER MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR AND MAN WHO CLAIMS HE NEVER HEARD OF MASSACHUSETTS SCOTT BROWN. BROWN RESPONDED TO THE LOSS WITH GRACE, DIGNITY AND A DOWN PAYMENT ON A HOUSE IN MAINE. (LAUGHTER) NOW WE COME TO DELAWARE AND AS USUAL CONTINUE RIGHT ON THROUGH TO NEW JERSEY WHERE DEMOCRAT INCUMBENT AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW CORY BOOKER IS REELECTED TO THE SENATE BRINGING THE NUMBER OF CHARISMATIC  BLACK MALE DEMOCRATS HAVING A GOOD NIGHT TO ONE. IN THE GREAT STATE OF KENTUCKY, THE RACE BETWEEN ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES AND INCUMBENT MITCH LUNDERGAN MCCONNELL  HAS BEEN NECK AND NECK FLAP (LAUGHTER) AND WITH 97.3% OF ME REPORTING, MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN REELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE. BIG NIGHT FOR MCCONNELL. LET'S GO LIVE TO MITCH McCONNELL'S VICTORY PARTY. ♪♪ (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE... THAT DOES LOOK LIKE FUN. THE MAN STILL HAS MOVES. OF COURSE, AS EVERY ELECTION NIGHT, I AM JOINED TONIGHT BY THE ENTIRE COLBERT REPORT ELECTION NEWS TEAM,  ANDREW SULLIVAN AND -- THAT'S IT. THANKS FOR JOINING US, ANDREW
HAPPY TO BE HERE, STEPHEN
Stephen: ANDREW WILL BE LIVE BLOGGING RESULTS IN OUR CYBERELECTION CAFE. WHAT ARE WE SEEING ON THE WEB THERE ANDREW?
NOTHING SO FAR. I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE INTERNET.
Stephen: I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU, WI-FI IS $12 WITH A PURCHASE OF A MUFFIN.
THIS IS BULLSHIT.
Stephen: THANKS FOR THAT REPORT, ANDREW. FOLKS, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW ALL MY CABLE NEWS COLLEAGUES OUT THERE ARE BRINGING IT HOT AND HARD TONIGHT. FOX NEWS COMING OUT BLAZING WITH A SECRET WEAPON SO SECRET THEY WON'T STOP TALKING ABOUT IT.
I HAD OUR BRAIN ROOM PULL RESEARCH FOR ME. WE HAD THE FOX NEWS BRAIN ROOM COME UP WITH STATISTICS FOR US.
I CHECKED WITH THE BRAIN ROOM.
I BRAIN ROOMED THIS HERE AT FOX. OUR CRACK TEAM IN THE BRAIN ROOM.
I WENT BACK AND HAD THE BRAIN ROOM LOOK. THE BRAIN ROOM --
Stephen: JUST AS YOU SUSPECTED, FOX NEWS KEEPS ALL THEIR BRAINS IN ONE ROOM AND -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND IT'S NOT THE ONE WITH THE CAMERAS. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, MSNBC HAS THEIR OWN BIG PLANS TONIGHT. THEY'VE ANNOUNCED LIVE ON AIR DURING MIDTERM COVERAGE CHRIS HAYES WILL GO THROUGH PUBERTY -- PUBERTY. GOOD LUCK, CHRIS. EXPLORE YOUR BODY. PERFECTLY NATURAL. BUT, AS ALWAYS, THE ONE THING THAT TRULY MATTERS ON ANY ELECTION NIGHT IS WHO HAS THE TOUCHIEST TOUCHSCREEN.
BILL HEMMER WILL BE AT HIS BILLBOARD.
I'M HERE AT THE BILLBOARD TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE RACES. WE'RE WATCHING WHAT'S AT STAKE WITH THE MAN.
WE'RE USE OUR GRAPHIC TO TRY TO SET THE TABLE FOR FOLKS AT HOME.
Stephen: BILL HEMMER IS TRACKING WHAT GOES RED AND BLUE ON THE BILLBOARD AND STEVE DOOCY WILL PINCH OUT THE SAME RESULTS FROM THE DOOCE DROPPER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COLOR CODED... BUT, OF COURSE, CNN'S JOHN KING, AS USUAL, SETS THE STANDARD.
CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN KING IS OVER AT THE MAGIC WALL.
HE'S AT THE MAGIC WALL. SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AT THE MAGIC WALL.
Stephen: YES,THE MAGIC WALL. IN THEIR DESPERATION, CNN IS  NOW DABBLING IN THE DARK ARTS. WELL, I WILL NOT BE OUT-OCCULTED. SO LET US VENTURE, NOW, TO A REALM OF ELDRITCH WIZARDRY WHERE THE HUMAN MIND IS RENT BY THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE HELL-BOUND! THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S MOUNTAINS OF MIDTERM MADNESS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES! YES! WELCOME! WELCOME, MY FRIENDS, TO THE MOUNTAINS OF MIDTERM MADNESS WILL I WILL SUMMON ELECTION RESULTS FROM THE DAMNED TO BOW BEFORE THE ELDER GOD YOGSOGOTH! AND LET'S SEE WHO WE'VE GOT. LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A CALL IN MINNESOTA WHERE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR AL FRANKEN WILL STAY PUT IN THE SENATE. SO EITHER HE'S GOING A GREAT JOB OR MINNESOTANS ARE JUST TOO  DARN POLITE TO ASK HIM TO LEAVE. IN MISSISSIPPI, THAD COCHRAN HAS BEATEN DEMOCRAT TRAVIS CHILDERS. I'M SURPRISED WE GOT THE RESULTS THIS QUICKLY SINCE BY LAW THE BALLOTS MUST BE COUNTED ONE MISSISSIPPI, TWO MISSISSIPPI, THREE MISSISSIPPI, SO ON. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) MOVING TO ALASKA BETWEEN MARK BEGICH AND DAN SULLIVAN, POLLS DO NOT THOSE TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT EAST COAST TIME BUT  COLBERT REPORT WATCHERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW BEFORE  ANYONE ELSE! SO HEAR ME! HEAR ME ALL-SEEING ANCIENT ONES! DRINK NOW MY BLOOD! TAKE NOW MY SOUL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AGHH! SPEAK, DEMON, SPEAK! WHO WON THE ALASKA SENATE RACE?
THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL!
Stephen: SERIOUSLY? I JUST SOLD MY SOUL TO THE DARK  LORD FOR ALL ETERNITY AND ALL I GET IS "TOO CLOSE TO CALL"?
OKAY, GIVE ME A SECOND...I'LL JUST CHECK NATE SILVER AT 538 (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I COULD DO THAT MYSELF.
I CAN'T GET ON WI-FI.
Stephen: IT'S $12
AND YOU HAVE TO BUY A MUFFIN. IT'S BULL[BLEEP].
AH, HERE IT IS! THE WINNER OF THE ALASKA SENATE RACE IS... HOWARD STERN, BABA BOOEY, BABA BOOEY!
Stephen: DAMN YOU, DEMON! DAMN YOU!  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.  HEAR ME! HEAR ME ELDER GODS!
