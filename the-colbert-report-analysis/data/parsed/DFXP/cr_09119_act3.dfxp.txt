WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PROFESSOR  OF AMERICAN HISTORY AT TUFTS. WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE HIM HERE  THE NIGHT THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN  HISTORY ENDED. PLEASE WELCOME PENIEL JOSEPH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH ME. YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY  AT TUFTS AND THE AUTHOR OF "DARK  DAYS, BRIGHT NIGHTS: FROM BLACK POWER TO BARACK OBAMA" RECENTLY  RELEASED IN PAPERBACK. NOW, SIR, CONGRATULATIONS ON  BEING HERE THE NIGHT THAT RACISM  WAS OFFICIALLY DECLARED OVER. IN AMERICA. DID YOU READ THE DECISION THAT  JUSTICE ROBERTS HANDED DOWN  TODAY?
I READ THE DECISION, STEVE. THAT'S EXACTLY WRONG. RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN  AMERICA. IN A WAY THIS DECISION...
Stephen: NOT ACCORDING TO  JOHN ROBERTS. WE HAVE EVIDENTLY PASSED THE  MAGIC MOMENT AT WHICH WE NO  LONGER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE JIM CROW STATES THAT USED TO  PROHIBIT MINORS FROM GOING TO  THE POLLS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT  ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T  DONE IT SINCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS PASSED.
THAT'S THE IRONY OF THIS  DECISION.
Stephen: OR THE MAGIC. THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT  ACTUALLY HAS PREVENTED RACIAL  DISCRIMINATION IN THESE STATES THAT USED TO BASICALLY OUTLAW  AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP AND  VOTING RIGHTS SO TODAY'S DECISION IS REALLY TERRIBLE FOR  OUR DEMOCRACY.
Stephen: LET'S TELL THE FOLKS  EXACTLY WHAT THE DECISION SAYS  BECAUSE IT AFFECTS SECTION 4 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965.
BASICALLY SECTION 4 PROVIDED  CERTAIN STATES HAD TO HAVE  PRECLEARANCE BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF THEIR VOTING LAWS, ANY OF  THEIR POLLING PLACES.
Stephen: I'M TEXAS AND I WANT  TO CHANGE SOMETHING ABOUT MY  VOTING LIKE WHERE I CHANGE MY POLLING STATIONS OR WHAT MY  CRITERIA IS, WHAT THE HOURS ARE  IN CERTAIN PARTS OF MY STATE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND SAY IS  THIS OKAY WITH YOU? AND ERIC HOLIER WOULD TAKE OUT  HIS PEN AND SAY YEAH OR NAY AND  TEXAS COULD OR COULD NOT DO THAT, RIGHT?
EXACTLY. ONE PROVISION WE HAVE TO  REMEMBER, STEPHEN, IF YOU WERE  NOT DISCRIMINATING FOR TEN YEARS YOU COULD APPLY FOR AN OPT OUT. CERTAIN STATES ACTUALLY DID AND  WERE SUCCESSFUL. SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHETHER  OR NOT STATES WANT TO ALLOW  AFRICAN-AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT VOTER  SUPPRESSION IN THE LAST  ELECTION, FLORIDA, OHIO.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK ABOUT  VOTER SUPPRESSION IN THE LAST  ELECTION NO. THAT'S A BIG IF.
I DO. Stephen: OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU SO DIFFERENT FROM  ME ON THAT ONE?
I BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY AND  CITIZENSHIP AND...
Stephen: SO DO I. LISTEN, JOHN ROBERTS, ONE OF THE  THINGS HE SAID IN THIS IS THAT  DATA IS 40 YEARS OLD. 1972. WHY SHOULD WE USE THAT CRITERIA  FROM '72 WHEN THEY DIDN'T EVEN  HAVE CELL PHONES THEN? YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ARE YOU AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN?
YES, I AM. Stephen: I DON'T SEE RACE. I HAVE MOVEDDED BEYOND THAT. I DON'T EVEN SEE MY OWN RACE. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I  BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I AGREE  WITH JOHN ROBERTS.
HERE'S THE THING. SOMETHING CALLED COLOR BLIND  RACISM.
Stephen: WHAT? COLOR BLIND RACISM.
WHAT THAT IS, YOU DON'T SEE  RACE.
Stephen: I DON'T. BUT THERE'S RACIAL  DISPARITIES AND OUTCOMES FROM  MASS INCARCERATION TO DISPARITY.
Stephen: IF I DON'T SEE RACE  AND THERE'S DISPARITY IN  OUTCOMES ISN'T IT IS THE FAULT OF THE WHOSE OUTCOME IS  DIFFERENT?
NO, IT'S THE FAULT OF  INSTITUTIONS.
Stephen: WHY? I DIDN'T DO WHAT I DID BECAUSE  YOU ARE OR ARE NOT A BLACK  PERSON. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.
STEPHEN, LET ME SPEAK FOR A  SECOND. A BRIEF HISTORY LESSON.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED ON  RACIAL SLAVERY. THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED 1619  EVEN WHEN WE WERE A COLONY IN  BRITISH NORTH AMERICA WE WERE FOUNDED ON RACIAL SLAVERY. 1776 WE HAVE ANOTHER ALMOST 200  YEARS OF SLAVERY AND JIM CROW.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. 500 YEARS OF RACIAL SEGREGATION  AND OPPRESSION OF  AFRICAN-AMERICANS. BUT WE'VE HAD 40 YEARS OF BE  GRUDGING, YOU KNOW, TOLERANCE. DON'T THAT COVER IT?
NO, IT DOESN'T. NOT AT ALL. NOT BY A LONG STRETCH. SO THERE IS NO END OF RACISM. IF ANYTHING, WE NEED A NATIONAL  CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE AND  DEMOCRACY.
Stephen: IF WE KEEP TALKING  ABOUT THIS NATIONAL CONVERSATION  THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, DOESN'T THAT MAKE RACISM WORSE  BECAUSE IT KEEPS REINFORCING  WHAT RACE EVERYBODY IS? CASE IN POINT. THIS VOTING RIGHTS ACT ITSELF  DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THE  ABILITY OF CERTAIN STATES TO CHANGE THEIR VOTING LAWS. BASED SOLELY ON THE COLOR OF THE  PEOPLE THAT THESE STATES TRIED  TO DISENFRANCHISE. WHO IS A RACIST NOW?
HERE'S A GOOD POINT, STEPHEN. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT RACE AND  DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY AND  RACE RELATIONS, IF WHITE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT RACE,  IMAGINE HOW BLACK PEOPLE FEEL. THEY'RE EXHAUSTED. THEY'RE EXHAUSTED AFTER HUNDREDS  OF YEARS OF HAVING TO TALK ABOUT  THIS. BUT DISCRIMINATION CONTINUES. DISCRIMINATION CONTINUES. SO A GREAT EXAMPLE. TEXAS TODAY DECIDED THAT THEIR  VOTER I.D. LAWS, WHICH JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT HAD OVERRULED LAST FALL, THEY'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT  THEM.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. ERIC HOLDER LAST FALL SAID YOU  CAN'T GO AHEAD WITH YOUR NEW  VOTER I.D. LAWS BECAUSE THOSE VIOLATE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT  BUT TODAY THE FIRST DAY OF THE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT HAS BEEN STRUCK DOWN, TEXAS SAID, TA-DA.
EXACTLY. Stephen: THAT'S KIND OF NICE. I'LL TELL YOU WHY. IT'S EASIER TO FIND RACISM THIS  WAY. IT'S LIKE IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR  PROSTATE CHECKED, BY THE TIME  IT'S LIKE A CANTELOPE, THE DOCTOR CAN FIND IT RIGHT AWAY. IF WE REMOVE ALL THE PROTECTIONS  AT THE POLLS, LET RACISM GO NUTS  FOR A FEW YEARS. AND THEN WE CAN GO, YOU KNOW  WHAT? WE DID NEED IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S KIND OF THE BEST POSSIBLE  ANSWER.
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT  POINT...
Stephen: IT IS A GREAT POINT. NO, IT WOULD BE A GREAT POINT  EXCEPT FOR THE FACT FOR 350  YEARS WE DID LET RACISM GO NUTS. IT WAS SO SWOLLEN AND SO  CANCEROUS THAT WE HAD TO DO  CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, VOTING RIGHTS  ACT.
Stephen: FINE. THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE A NEW  VOTING RIGHTS ACT. IT WASN'T THAT HARD TO PASS THE  FIRST TIME, WAS IT?
VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO PASS. Stephen: CONGRESS CAN GET  STUFF DONE, SIR.
HERE'S A GREAT, A  MINI-HISTORY LESSON ABOUT THE  CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.
Stephen: I'LL TRY TO STAY  AWAKE.
1954 TO 1965, THE BROWN  PUBLIC SCHOOL DESEGREGATION  DECISION CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF '64 VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF '65, CROWN  JEWEL IS THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT  OF '65. MARTIN LUTHER KING, Jr.,  SELMA, CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS  GOT HIS SKULL FRACTURED TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE.
Stephen: HEY, BABY I WAS AT  THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. I WAS AT THE "I HAVE A DREAM  SPEECH."  DON'T PLAY THAT BACK PEOPLE WENT  ON MARCHES CARD. I WAS AT THE MARCHES. WERE YOU?
I WAS NOT. Stephen: YOU WERE NOT AT THE  MARCHES.
I WAS NOT BORN IN 1965. Stephen: I COULD BE MADDER  THAN YOU. OH, I WASN'T BORN THAT. THAT'S A CONVENIENT EXCUSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US  ME. DARK DAYS, BRIGHT NIGHTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT
