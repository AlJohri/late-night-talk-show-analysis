Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE  REPORT."  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, YOU'RE VERY KIND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, NATION, I DON'T WANT TO  ALARM ANYONE BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE MY STUDIO TONIGHT, YOU MAY VERY  WELL BE HUNTED FOR SPORT. BECAUSE YESTERDAY NEW YORK CITY  BECAME A KILL ZONE.
A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS RULED NEW  YORK CITY'S CONTROVERSIAL STOP  AND FRISK PROGRAM VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF  MINORITIES BY "CONDUCTING STOPS  IN A RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY MANNER."
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,  FOLKS. UNELECTED ACTIVIST JUDGE HAS  REJECTED STOP AND FRISK ON THE  BIZARRE THEORY THAT MINORITIES HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOT  TO BE STOPPED AT RANDOM AND MAN  HANDLE BID STRANGERS. (LAUGHTER)  DESPITE THE FACT THAT WHEN THE  CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN  MINORITIES WEREN'T EVEN INVENTED  YET. (LAUGHTER)  I THINK. THANKFULLY MAYOR BLOOMBERG SAYS  HE WILL FIGHT TO PRESERVE STOP  AND FRISK BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU CAN'T MAKE A SAFETY OMELET  WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW BROWN  EGGS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  JIM?
WE GO TO WHERE THE REPORTS OF  CRIME ARE. THOSE UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN TO BE  POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND MY  *R  MINORITY NEIGHBORHOOD.
Stephen: OKAY, THE PROGRAM  IS NOT ABOUT COLOR, IT'S ABOUT  FRISKABILITY. (LAUGHTER)  IN FACT, I DON'T SEE COLOR, NOT  EVEN MY OWN. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I  BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I DON'T GET  FRISKED. (LAUGHTER)  THE POINT IS FOR YEARS, FOR  YEARS THIS HAS BEEN A SAFE CITY,  A WONDERFUL TOY FOR A GIRL AND A  BOY. BUT NOW IT WILL BE TEEMING WITH  UNFRISKED BLACK AND/OR HISPANIC  PEOPLE. I WON'T PWEFPB ABLE TO CROSS THE  STREET TO AVOID A SUSPICIOUS  LOOKING AFRICAN AMERICAN WITHOUT RUNNING INTO A QUESTIONABLE  LATINO ON THE OTHER SIDE! WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO WALK DOWN  THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET "HERE  COMES THE CAB" I'M DEAD. (LAUGHTER)  AND, FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST WHO'S  ON THE STREETS NOW, IT'S ALSO  ABOUT THE THUGS HEADED BACK  THERE. BECAUSE YESTERDAY ATTORNEY  GENERAL ERIC HOLDER ANNOUNCED  NEW FEDERAL GUIDELINES TO UNDERMINE OUR WAR ON DRUGS.
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER  ANNOUNCED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  WILL STOP SEEKING MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR OFFENDERS  ACCUSED OF LOW-LEVEL NONVIOLENCE  DRUG CRIMES LIKE A SMALL-TIME DRUG CURRIER. INSTEAD, THEY'LL ASK TO SEND  THEM TO DRUG TREATMENT AND  COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS.
Stephen: NO JAIL TIME, JUST  REHAB. IT'S LIKE EVERY MINOR DRUG  OFFENDER SUDDENLY BECAME A WHITE  COLLEGE STUDENT. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, TANK INFULLY FOLKS IT'S  ONE GROUP THAT IS ALWAYS DISHING  OUT THE FRISKY BUFFET, THE  T.S.A. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE SAFETY OF  THIS NATION IN THE PALMS OF  THEIR HAND. ALSO YOUR GENITALS. (LAUGHTER)  AND THERE --  (LAUGHTER). AND THEY'RE FINDING ALL SORTS OF  NEW PLACES TO DO IT.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT A  SPECIAL T.S.A. TEAM SEARCHING  YOU BEFORE YOU SEE YOUR FAVORITE SPORTS TEAM OR CONCERT? THE T.S.A.'S EXPANDED DUTIES NOW  INCLUDE SECURITY CHECKS AT  PASSENGER TRAIN, SUBWAY, AND BUS STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION.
THEY'RE NOW EXPANDING INTO  SPORTING EVENTS, RODEOS, MUSIC  FESTIVALS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,  T.S.A. AGENTS ARE HEADED TO OUR  STADIUMS AND PASSENGER TRAINS. AND THE HIRING PROCESS SHOULD BE  EASY SINCE THERE'S ALREADY  PLENTY OF GUYS ON THE SUBWAY READY TO GIVE PATDOWNS. (LAUGHTER)  AND THANK GOODNESS, FOLKS. THANK GOODNESS THE T.S.A. WILL  BE ABLE TO SECURE OUR VULNERABLE  RODEOS. BUT A WORD OF ADVICE FOR  BRONCOS: THOSE HORSESHOES ARE  GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE AT THE METAL DETECTOR SO INVEST IN SOME  CROCS NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT FOLKS THIS MASSIVE EXPANSION  COMES AFTER REPORTS THAT THE T.S.A. MISCONDUCT INCREASED 26%  OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WELL,  THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE UP TO SPREAD MISCONDUCT OVER A BROADER  SAMPLE SIZE. JUST LIKE IF YOU EVER CHEAT ON  YOUR GIRLFRIEND YOU HAVE TO GET  A BUNCH MORE GIRLFRIEND SO YOU'RE MORE FAITHFUL PER CAPITA. (LAUGHTER)  THIS EXPANSION OF THE T.S.A. BEYOND AIRPORTS IS KNOWN AS  VIPR. THERE'S NO "E" IN THAT WORD  BECAUSE IT WAS DETAINED FOR  APPEARING TWICE IN THE WORD "YEMEN."  (LAUGHTER)  AND, FOLKS, AS VIPR MISSION  CLEARLY STATES, T.S.A.'S VISIBLE INTERMODAL PREVENTION AND  RESPONSE PROGRAM IS PART OF A  NATIONWIDE SECURITY PROGRAM THAT SERVES ALL MODES OF  TRANSPORTATION. YOU HEAR THAT? ALL MODE! THAT MEANS CARS-- INCLUDING  NASCARS. SOME BEFORE EACH LAP THEY'RE  GOING TO HAVE TO GET STOPPED FOR  A SCREENING. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE  EVERYONE'S SAFE BEFORE THEY  CRASH FOR OUR AMUSEMENT. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, OBVIOUSLY WE ALSO NEED  AGENTS TO MONITOR CHAIR LIFTS. THINK ABOUT IT: THEY'RE FULL OF  SUSPICIOUS PEOPLE WEARING MASKS  WHO NEVER RIDE THEM ROUND TRIP, JUST ONE WAY. WHERE DO THEY GO? NO ONE KNOWS. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, WHAT ABOUT THE MOST  WIDELY USED AMERICAN  TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OF ALL? LEGS. WITH ALL THE THREATS OUT THERE,  WOULDN'T YOU FEEL MORE  COMFORTABLE WITH THE T.S.A. AGENT CLINGS TO ONE AT ALL  TIMES? (LAUGHTER)  THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE  WHO SAY THE WORLD IS GETTING  SAFER, WE CAN'T LET OUR FEAR OF CRIME AND TERRORISTS CHANGE OUR  WAY OF LIFE. HERE TO DEFEND THE "LET THEM  KILL US" VIEW IS NEUROSCIENTIST  AND AUTHOR OF "THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE: WHY VIOLENCE HAS  DECLINED" STEVEN PINKER. MR. PINKER, THANKS FOR COMING  BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE BETTER  ANGELS OF OUR NATURE: WHY  VIOLENCE HAS DECLINED." BEFORE WE GET STARTED, CAN YOU  PUT OUT YOUR ARMS, PLEASE? (LAUGHTER)  JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE  GOOD. TK-PB FOE WHAT YOU WERE HIDING  UNDER THAT HELMET. OKAY. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WE ARE  SAFER? 9/11!
9/11 WAS OFF THE CHARTS    3,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED EVERY  YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY ALONE, 16,000 PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY  ORDINARY HOMICIDES, 40,000  PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES, 3,000 PEOPLE DIE BY DROWNING, 300 OF  THEM IN BATHTUBS.
Stephen: WHY ISN'T THE  T.S.A. GIVING SPE A PONG BATH? (LAUGHTER)
EVERY YEAR OTHER THAN 2001  MORE PEOPLE DIE FROM BEE STINGS,  PEANUT ALLERGIES, FROM COLLISIONS ON HIGHWAYS WITH  DEER, FROM --
Stephen: YOU SAID OTHER  THAN 2001. OTHER THAN 2001. SO YOU'RE TAKING 9/11 OUT OF THE  MIX. THAT'S LIKE SAYING THE GERMANS  KILLED VERY FEW JEWS-- EXCEPT  HITLER. TAKE HITLER OUT OF THE MIX AND  THE GERMANS WERE LOVELY TO THE  JEWISH PEOPLE.
AFTER 2001 THERE WAS A  PREDICTION THAT WE'D HAVE 9/11S  EVERY MONTH. THAT THERE WOULD BE SHOULDER  FIRED MISSILES THAT TAKE DOWN  PLANES, THAT THERE WOULD BE BOMBS AS DISNEYWORLD, AT SUPER  BOWLS. THAT PREDICTION HAS NOT COME TO  PASS.
Stephen: IT SEEMS LIKE WITH  THIS BOOK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET  US TO CALM DOWN ABOUT OUR FEARS BUT I SEE THINGS TO BE AFRAID OF  EVERYWHERE I LOOK. DO DO YOU WATCH CABLE NEWS?
I DO. THE PROBLEM IS YOU'LL BE MISLED  IF YOU BASE YOUR ASSESSMENT OF  HOW DANGEROUS THE WORLD IS ON THE NEWS BECAUSE THE NEWS IS  ABOUT STUFF THAT HAPPENS. ANYTHING THAT GOES BANG ANYWHERE  IN THE WORLD THAT MAKES THE  NEWS. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DIE OF  NATURAL CAUSES DON'T HAVE A  REPORTER AND CAMERA CREW AT THEIR BEDS. THERE ARE MORE AND MORE OF THEM,  THERE ARE FEWER AND FEWER  VIOLENT EVENTS BUT EVERY VIOLENT EVENT THAT DOES HAPPEN MAKES THE  NEWS.
Stephen: I'LL GIVE YOU AN  EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT THE NEWS,  THIS IS REALITY, THAT VIPR  PROGRAM. FOUR YEARS AGO IT WAS A $30  MILLION PROGRAM, NOW IT'S A $100  MILLION PROGRAM. THAT SAYS TO ME THE WORLD GOT  $70 MILLION MORE DANGEROUS. OR ELSE IT WOULDN'T BE THERE,  RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THE SECURITY APPARATUS  DOESN'T DO COST-BENEFIT  CALCULATIONS, WE SPENT SOMETHING LIKE A TRILLION DOLLARS SINCE  2001 ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND  RELATED EXPENSES BUT NOBODY DOES THE MATH. COULD WE HAVE MADE OURSELVES  MUCH SAFER SPENDING THAT  TRILLION DOLLARS IN OTHER WAYS?
Stephen: LIKE ALTERNATES TO  BATHING? (LAUGHTER)
FOR EXAMPLE. OR STOPPING PEOPLE WHO TEXT  WHILE THEY DRIVE.
Stephen: IF THE WORLD IS A  SAFER PLACE, WHY CAN I STILL  DIE? (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  UNTIL WE ARE IMMORTAL, SHOULDN'T  WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER NO MATTER WHAT THE POWER TO KEEP  OURSELVES ALIVE FOREVER?
WE SHOULD. THEN PREVENTING TERRORISTS  ATTACKS IS NOT A COST EFFECTIVE  WAY TO DO IT. YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO DIE  IN A CAR ACCIDENT, FALLING OFF A  LADDER.
Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE  DIE FROM FALLING OFF LADDERS.
THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR.
Stephen: SHOULD WE BE  INEVADING LADDERSTAN? (LAUGHTER)  IS THAT POSSIBLE?
20,000 DEATHS A YEAR FROM  ACCIDENTAL FALLS. WE JUST READ ABOUT ONE IN A  STADIUM YESTERDAY. MOST DON'T MAKE THE KNEW. SOME GUY FALLS OFF A LADDER AND  DIES. BUT YOU ADD THEM UP OVER THE  COURSE THE OF THE YEAR AND  YOU'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GET KILLED IN A HOUSEHOLD ACCIDENT  THAN A TERRORIST ATTACK.
Stephen: YOU SAID THE  NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DIED IN  TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE NEWER THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHOSE  PAJAMAS HAVE CAUGHT ON FIRE. (LAUGHTER)
EVERY YEAR BUT 1995 AND 2001.
Stephen: ARE PAJAMAS THE  ORIGINAL SLEEPER CELL? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DR. PINKER, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE BOOK IS "THE BETTER ANGELS  OF OUR NATURE" STEVEN PINKER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
