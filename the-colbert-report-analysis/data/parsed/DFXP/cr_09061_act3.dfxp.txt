EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT MADE A NEW  DOCUMENTARY CALLED SOUND CITY. NOW HE'S ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AT  THE STUDIOS AND RECORD SOME OF  THE GREATEST INTERVIEWS. PLEASE WELCOME DAVE GROHL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, DAVE. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU BEEN? LAST TIME YOU SAW YOU WE WERE  HANGING OUT IN THE WHITE HOUSE  TOGETHER.
THAT'S USUALLY WHERE WE BUMP  INTO EACH OTHER.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
YOU WOULDN'T IMAGINE I WOULD  BE LET INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: YOU WERE  FANTASTIC, INCREDIBLE FOR THE  KENNEDY CENTER HONORS ROCKING LED ZEPPELIN.
I WAS.
Stephen: DRUMMER FOR  NIRVANA, LEAD OF THE F.A.O. FIGHTERS BUT -- FOO FIGHTERS NOW  YOU ARE A DOCUMENT DLRKS ARIAN. YOU SOLD MILLIONS OF COPIES OF  NIRVANA NEVER MIND ALONE. WHY NOT PHONE IT IN AND GET FAT?
I DECIDED TO MAKE THIS MOVIE  BECAUSE THE STUDIO WHERE WE MADE  NIRVANA'S NEVER MIND WAS  CLOSING. THAT STUDIO CHANGED MY LIFE. WHEN WE WENT THERE WE WERE THERE  FOR 16 DAYS AND THOSE 16 DAYS  THAT WE MADE THAT RECORD, NEVER MIND COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE.
Stephen: THAT'S THE NAME OF  THE MOVIE CALLED "SOUND CITY."
IT'S CALLED "SOUND CITY."
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO TO A  GUY WHOP DIDN'T MAKE  DOCUMENTARIES TO MICK A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE PLACE YOU  RECORDED?
I WAY I LOOK AT IT I NEVER  TOOK LESSONS TO PLAY THE DRUMS  OR GUITAR. I JUST SORT OF FIGURED IT OUT. I THINK YOU IF YOU ARE PASSIONATE  ABOUT SOMETHING AND DRIVEN AND  FOCUSED YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.
Stephen: NOBODY TAUGHT TO  ME YELL AT PEOPLE.
AND YOU ARE REALLY GOOD AT  IT. YOU ARE GREAT.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
I HAD AN IDEA AND A FRIEND  WITH A CAMERA. I START CALLING EVERYONE FROM  MEMBERS OF CHEAP TRICK TO  MEMBERS OF RICK SPRINGFIELD TO STEVIE NICKS.
Stephen: ALL PEOPLE WHO  RECORDED AT THE STUDIO.
YES AND I ASKED TO TALK TO  THEM AND I WOUND UP WITH 40  INTERVIEWS AND I TURNED INTO AN ACTUAL FILM.
Stephen: THIS SOUNDBOARD IN  FRONT THIS IS THE IMPETUS. THIS STARTED THIS THING ROLLING  HERE. WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S A MIXING CONSOLE. RUPERT NEEDS MADE MIXING DESKS  IN THE 70s. STILL MAKES RECORDING EQUIPMENT. THESE ARE CONSIDERED THE  CADILLAC OF RECORDING EQUIPMENT. THEY SOUND GREAT, GREAT FOR ROCK  MUSIC AND SIMPLE. THIS SAY CUSTOM ORDERED BOARD  THAT EVERYONE FROM EVEL KNIEVIL  TO TOM PETTY TO RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, CHARLES MANSON RECORDED  AT SOUND CITY. THE STORY IS COMPLETEY NUTTED.
Stephen: SERIOUSLY. DID EVEL KNIEVIL JUMP THIS BOARD  OVER CHARLES MANSON?
THAT'S A MOVIE.
Stephen: THE GUY OFFERED TO  SELL THE BOARD.
I HEARD THEY WERE CLOSING AND  BECAUSE I CONSIDERED THAT BOARD  TO BE RESPONSIBLE FROM WHERE I AM TODAY. I SAID I WOULD BE HONORED TO  TELL IT IF YOU WANT TO SILT.
Stephen: DOES IT HAVE A  STORY TO TELL?
THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO  WHEN WE GOT IT IS SCRUB THE COKE  CANE AND FRIED CHICKEN OUT.
Stephen: THAT WAS A GREAT  ALBUM, TOO, COCAINE AND FRIED  CHICKEN.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: LEGENDARY.
AMAZING.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO  LISTEN TO NEVER MIND AGAIN AND  AS PART OF IT DID YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT RECORDING  SESSION WAS LIKE?
INTERVIEWING LIKE BUTCH WHO  IS THE PRODUCER OR CHRIS, THE  BASS PLAYER OF NIRVANA, SITTING DOWN AND TALKING ABOUT IT  BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES. I REMEMBERED A LOT MORE ABOUT  THE COUPLE WEEKS WE WERE THERE.
Stephen: IS IT LIKE PULLING  OUT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK  AND LIKE (bleep) WE WERE SO  YOUNG.
NOBODY THOUGHT WE WERE GOING  TO BE A BIG BAND. AT THE TIME MICHAEL BOLTON WAS  HUGE.
Stephen: STILL.
STILL HUGE.
Stephen: THE MAN PLAYS RED  ROCK.
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE  GOING TO SELL MILLIONS OF  RECORDS SO EVERYONE JUST SORT OF LEFT US ALONE WHICH WAS GREAT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK ABOUT  THE SESSIONS NOW AND SAY WHY  DIDN'T WE TURN UP THE DRUMS.
I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.
Stephen: REALLY?
YES IT TURNED OUT PRETTY  GOOD.
Stephen: YOU RECORDED AN  ALBUM WITH THE BOARD. YOU HAVE A GROUP CALLED THE  SOUND CITY PLAYERS. YOU GOT YOU, CHRIS, STEVIE  NICKS, JOHN FOGERTY, SIR PAUL  McCART KNIT, SIR RICK  SPRINGFIELD, SIR RICK NIELSEN.
YES.
Stephen: ARE YOU DOING  TOURS.
PLAYING AS MANY AS WE CAN. LOGISTICALLY IT'S HARD TO GET  ONE OF GUYS AND STEVIE NICKS IN  THE SAME ROOM.
Stephen: BUT McCARTNEY IS  ALWAYS AVAILABLE.
WE'RE DOING A SHOW TONIGHT AT  THE HAMMERSTEIN BALLROOM WHERE  WE ARE GOING TOLL ROLL OUT THREE AND A HALF HOURS WORTH OF MUSIC.
Stephen: YOU NEED A BACK-UP  SINGER.
YOU WANT TO COME AND SING?
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE  GREAT. I'LL BE THERE. DAVE GROHL, THE MOVIE IS
