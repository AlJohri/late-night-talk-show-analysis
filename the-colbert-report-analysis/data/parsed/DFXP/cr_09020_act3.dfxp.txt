EVERYBODY. [CROWD CHEERING] YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO THE  PRESIDENTIAL RACE, TONIGHT THE  LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS COULD CHANGE HANDS. OR IN THE CASE OF SENATE  MINORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL,  AMPHIBIANS. THEY ONLY NEED TO PICK UP FOUR  SEATS AND THEY'LL SEIZE CONTROL. WITH THAT IN MIND LET'S TAKE A  LOOK AT SOME OF THE KEY RACES. THE COLBERT REPORT CAN NOW  INFORM FORMER GOVERNOR ANGUS  KING HAS WON MAKING THE FIRST SENATE SEAT EVER HELD BY A  BURGER KING MENU ITEM. [LAUGHTER] AND FOLKS, THIS IS TRUE. THIS KING IS AN INDEPENDENT. YOU SAY GOOD-BYE TO BIPARTISAN  GRID LOCK AND SAY HELLO TO TRI  PARTISAN GRID LOCK. THROUGH YOU WITH MELTED BETTER,  MAINE. NOW IN INDIANA JOE DONNELLY HAS  BEATEN RICHARD MOOREDUCK AFTER  MOOREDOCK MADE CONTROVERSY COMMENT OF RAPE BEING GOD'S  INTENTION IS PROVING THE OLD  POLITICAL ADAGE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS BAD RAPE PUBLICITY. NOW WE'RE ALSO FOLLOWING THE  SENATE RACE IN WISCONSIN WHERE  TAMMY BALDWIN HAS BECOME, SHE HAS BECOME THE FIRST LESBIAN  SENATOR. WELL FIRST OPENLY LESBIAN  SENATOR BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT  FOOLING ANYBODY, LINDSEY GRAHAM. NOW OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THE  SENATE WE'RE ALSO TRACKING ALL  THE NATION'S REFERENDA. CALIFORNIA ALONE HAS 11 BALLOT  MEASURES THIS YEAR AND FLORIDA  HAS MANY THAT MOST VOTERS SIMPLY SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM AND SAY I  AGREE. THERE'S ONE IN LOS ANGELES THAT  COULD AFFECT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY VOTERS WILL  DECIDE ON ELECTION DAY IF ACTORS  SHOULD FILM CONDOMS WHILE SHOOTING PORN FILMS AS THE SEX  INITIATIVE MEASURE B WOULD NOT  ONLY MANDATE THE USE OF CONDOMS BUT ALSO REQUIRE THE LOS ANGELES  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO  LEAD INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT  EFFORTS. LET'S RIGHT, FOLKS, MORE  BURDENSOME REGULATIONS FOR  AMERICA'S JOB CREATORS IN THE KEY SECTORS OF HAND RIM AND  BLOW. BUT, FOLKS I GOT TO SAY TODAY'S  MOST WATCHED INITIATIVE HAVE TO  DO WITH MARIJUANA. THAT'S RIGHT. EVERYONE'S WATCHING YOU  MARIJUANA USERS. IT'S YOUR MEMORANDUM PLUS YOUR  STASH, JIMMY.
THE QUESTION IS ON MARIJUANA  LEGALIZATION. IT IS UP IN THREE STATES EXAMINE  WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT  DECRIMINALIZING MARIJUANA, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MARIJUANA FOR  MEDICINAL USESES WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT ACTUALLY LEGALIZING MARIJUANA IN COLORADO,  WASHINGTON AND OREGON. AND THAT WILL BE FOR ANYBODY  OVER THE AGE OF 21.
Stephen:  WHAT IS THIS  COUNTRY COMING TO. 21 YEAR OLDS ALLOWED TO SMOKE  MARIJUANA? IT MAKES ME WANT TO DRINK MYSELF  INTO A BLIND RAGE AND DO  SOMETHING I'LL REGRET. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, LAST TIME I CHECKED,  THE PRO MARIJUANA VOTES WERE UP  57 OVER 42 AGAINST. SO JIMMY, LOCK THE DOOR BEFORE  MY AUDIENCE MOVES TO DENVER. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
