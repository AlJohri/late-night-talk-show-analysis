Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. SO I WON'T. SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON AT LAST THANKS FOR COMING HERE FOR ONE OF MY LAST 12 SHOWS, IT'S AN HONOR.
YOU'RE SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, HUH?
Stephen: NO, WE HAVE SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST, TO PARAPHRASE THE GOSPEL. NOW YOU ARE A FIVE TIME-- U.S. SENATOR.
WHAT CHAPTER IN THE BIBLE IS THAT?
Stephen: SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST.
YEAH.
Stephen: AS THE MARRIAGE AT CANAA WHEN HE TURNS THE WATER INTO WINE, THE WINE THAT HE MAKES OUT OF THE WATER IS PASSED AROUND TO THE GUESTS AND THEY SAY THOU HAST SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO APPEAL TO CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR GOSPEL, SIR?
NOW I REMEMBER, THANK YOU FOR REFRESHING MY MEMORY.
Stephen: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, FATHER McCAIN. NOW HOW WAS YOUR THANKSGIVING. I KNOW YOU ARE A BIG GRILLER, DID YOU GRILL YOUR OWN TURKEY.
NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT FOUR FRIED TURKEYS AND DIDN'T SET THE DECK ON FIRE ONCE.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS.
DEEP-FRY YOUR TURKEYS, MY FRIENDS, YOU WILL NEVER GO BACK TO ANYTHING ELSE IT IS KIND OF ADDICTIVE, A LITTLE BIT LIKE SOME SUBSTANCES THAT YOU USED TO USE.
Stephen: WE AGREED BACKSTAGE WE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT MY CRACK HABIT.
THERE WE GO.
Stephen: NOW SIR, YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED 13 SOLDIERS, A PERSONAL HISTORY OF AMERICANS AT WAR.
YUP.
Stephen: WHY 13, THAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNLUCKY NUMBER.
ONE FOR EVERY MAJOR CONFLICT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SINCE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, AND THE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS, MEN AND WOMEN. WE TOOK ONE INDIVIDUAL FOR EACH CONFLICT AND TRIED TO PUT THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONFLICT. BUT ALSO DESCRIBED TO THE READER EXACTLY WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH, AND THE DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES OF DEFENDING YOUR COUNTRY. THIS ONE, OUR FRIEND JOINED AT AGE 15, THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR, CHARLES MARTIN. ALMOST STARVED TO DEATH. FOUGHT IN SEVERAL BATTLES AND FINALLY WE WON, OBVIOUSLY. AND IT TOOK 30 YEARS.
Stephen: 15.
JOINED AT 15. AND FOUGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
Stephen: AT 15 I WAS STILL WATCHING STAR WARS. AT 50 I'M STILL WATCHING STAR WARS. NOW I NEVER SERVED BECAUSE MY DOCTOR SAYS I HAVE AN INCURABLE CONDITION CALLED I DIDN'T WANT TO. BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM WHAT I HAVE READ AND WHAT I HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WHO DID SERVE IN OUR WARS, THAT WAR IS HORRIBLE. SHOULD BOOKS ABOUT WAR, IF THEY'RE GOOD, ALSO BE IN SOME WAYS HORRIBLE? OR HORRIFYING.
AS LONG AS WE UNDERSTAND THAT WAR IS TERRIBLE, IT'S THE WORST OF ALL THINGS. IT DESTROYS LIVES.
Stephen: DO YOU COVER ANY OF OUR PRESENT WARS IN THIS? FOR INSTANCE BILL O'REILLY AND THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS?
THERE IS ONLY ONE HERO TO WRITE ABOUT THAT, AND THAT IS BILL O'REILLY.
THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THERE THAT FOUGHT IN AFGHANISTAN, SHE IS A MEDIC. SHE-- MONICA THOMAS. SHE WAS IN A CONVOY, HIT BY AN IED. SHE RUSHED IN TO SAVE THE LIVES AND SHE DID OF SEVERAL OTHER OF HER COMRADES. AND BY THE WAY, HER HEROISM AND THAT OF WOMEN LIKE HER SHOULD PUT TO REST ANY DISCUSSION OR ARGUMENT WHETHER WOMEN SHOULD SERVE IN COMBAT OR NOT.
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT-- LET'S TALK ABOUT-- LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFGHANISTAN.
YEP.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SAID WE WILL HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR?
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE PRESIDENT FEELS HIS FORCE TO DO THAT, HE CONTINUES TO TELL US WHAT WE WANT AND END UP DOING IT, WE NOW HAVE 1500 MORE AS YOU KNOW RECENTLY. AND NOW THESE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING AWAY.
Stephen: SHOULD WE HAVE TROOPS.
WE SHOULD HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
WE SHOULD HAVE MORE AIR CONTROLLERS, WE SHOULD HAVE SPECIAL FORCES AND WE SHOULD HAVE INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE WITH THAT. I DONE MEAN SENDING IN THE 82nd AIRBORNE AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS.
Stephen: BUT WHY NOT SEND IN THE 82 AIRBORNE AND THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS IF IT IS A BIG PROBLEM IF WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE GUYS, WHY PUSSY FOOT AROUND, WHY NOT TROOP BOOT IT AROUND?
FIRST OF ALL, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD NOT ACCEPT SUCH A THING.
Stephen: ISN'T LEADERSHIP ABOUT SAYING NO, WE HAVE TO DO THIS THING.
WE CAN GET THE JOB DONE.
Stephen: PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT THE SURGE WHEN THE SURGE HAPPENED. BUT AS YOU WOULD SAY, THE SURGE WORKED. ISN'T THIS A SURGE IN TO SYRIA?
IT IS. BUT IT'S GOT TO IT BE DONE IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SENDING IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF TROOPS. NOT SENDING IN THE LARGE NUMBERS THAT WE DID IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
DIDN'T WE UNDERESTIMATE WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO IN  IRAQ AND THAT'S WHY THE WAR TOOK SO LONG?
WE HAD A FLAWED POLICY. BY THE WAY, I WAS AGAINST IT, SAID RUMSFELD OUGHT TO BE FIRED. GUYS LIKE YOU, YOU CALL ME THE BRAVE MAVERICK. NOW WHEN I SAID THAT OBAMA IS MISHANDLING IT, NOW HE IS THE ANGRY OLD MAN. I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE I AM NOW.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU AND THE ANGRY OLD MAN OF CHUCK HAGEL WHO JUST GOT TOSSED OUT THE DOOR BY OBAMA. YOU VOTED AGAINST HAGEL'S CONFIRMATION AS DID I, AT HOME, YELLING AT THE SCREEN. ARE YOU GLAD HE'S OUT?
I THINK THAT CHUCK AND BY THE WAY HE IS A FRIEND AND HE'S A DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN. HE FOUGHT AS AN ENLISTED MAN DURING THE VIETNAM WAR AND I HONOR THAT. BUT HE WASN'T THE RIGHT GUY FOR THE JOB. AND IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT ALL THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE WITHIN A SMALL GROUP IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
SO WE NEED SOMEBODY WHO HAS GOT EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE HERE FOR THE COLBERT BUMP. IS THIS A TRIAL BALLOON TO BE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE?
ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING, ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WOULD HAVE THE FULL RESOURCES OF THE COLBERT REPORT AT YOUR BACK IN 2016. IF IT WERE STILL ON THE AIR. SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 13 SOLDIERS. GO GET IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
