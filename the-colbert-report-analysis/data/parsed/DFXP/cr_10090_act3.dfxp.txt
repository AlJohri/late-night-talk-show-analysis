I DO.
Stephen:  THAT TAKES YOU BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD, THE TOWN YOU GREW UP IN. IT'S CALLED "THE LAST SHIP," AND IT'S A MUSICAL THAT STARTS THIS SUMMER IN CHICAGO AND THEN COMES TO BROADWAY. TELL FOLKS ABOUT THE STORY OF THE LAST SHIP.
I WAS BORN IN THE SHADOW I A SHIPYARD IN A LITTLE TOWN ON THE NORTHEAST COAST OF ENGLAND.
Stephen:  I THINK WE HAVE A PICTURE OF WHAT THE SHIPYARD IS LIKE.
ONE OF MY EARLIEST MEMORIES IS A GIANT SHIP AT THE END OF MY STREET.
Stephen:  THERE IT IS.
PRETTY SURREAL ENVIRONMENT TO GROW UP IN. I DIDN'T WANT TO WORK IN THE SHIPYARD. THE SHIPYARD WAS DANGEROUS AND TOXIC AND PRETTY UNPLEASANT, SO I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO ESCAPE.
Stephen:  OKAY.
SO I WANTED TO BE A SINGER. I WANTED TO SING SONGS IN THE WORLD. I WANTED TO BE PAID EXTRAVAGANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WANTED TO BE FAMOUS.
Stephen:  WHAT MADE YOU THINK YOU COULD DO THAT?
I WAS VERY CONFIDENT AS A CHILD. ANYTHING BUT WORK IN THE SHIPYARD.
Stephen:  AND WHEN DID THE SHIPYARD END?
THE SHIPYARD CLOSED IN THE '80s.
Stephen:  SO IS THIS MUSICAL ABOUT THE CLOSING OF THE SHIPYARD?
YEAH.
Stephen:  IS MARGARET THATCHER THE HERO. THATCHER, I'M A HUGE FAN, A HUGE FAN OF HERS.
WE'RE NOT A FAN OF MRS. THATCHER. IT BEGINS IN SOCIAL HISTORY, THE STORY AND THEN IT BECOMES ALLEGORY.
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.
I'M NOT SURE I DO.
Stephen:  ALLEGORY. YOU ALSO HAVE THE RAIN FOREST BENEFIT COMING UP AT CARNEGIE HALL, THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF YOUR RAIN FOREST BENEFIT.
THAT'S TRUE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen:  WHAT SIDE OF THAT WHOLE RAIN FOREST ISSUE DO YOU COME DOWN ON? BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T CUT THOSE TREES DOWN, THEY WOULD SWALLOW OUR CITIES, OKAY. AT THIS POINT, WE'RE JUST PLAYING DEFENSE. SO WHAT'S-- WHAT'S YOUR TAKE HERE ON THAT RAIN FOREST THING?
MY INSTINCT IS WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH IT.
Stephen:  REALLY.
THAN WITHOUT IT.
Stephen:  REALLY?
YEAH, JUST AN INSTINCT.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WHY DO WE NEED TREES? WE HAVE PLASTIC NOW.
I-- OUR REAL EMPHASIS IS NOT ON TREES.
Stephen:  NO, WHAT'S IT ON?
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE BETTER.
Stephen:  PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE AMAZON?
NOT JUST THE AMAZON. THE TROPICAL FOREST GENERALLY. THEY'RE BELEAGUERED PEOPLE.
Stephen:  WHAT DOES "BELEAGUERED" MEAN? IS THAT LIKE ALLEGORY.
UNDER SIEGE.
Stephen:  WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE ONE NAME?
IT'S --
Stephen:  WHY?
FANTASTIC FOR SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS.
Stephen:  SAVES SO MUCH TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS SUMMER, THIS SUMMER-- LAST SUMMER, YOU DID A TOUR WHICH I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEP. IT WAS YOU AND PAUL SIMON. RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen:  FOR JUST THIS SUMMER, WERE YOU STING-FUNKLE?
