(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, IT'S NO SECRET I AM T.V.'S FOREMOST HEART EXPERT. I LOVE IT ALL, YOUR SUIT MAN, YOUR DRIPPY GUY, YOUR APPLE FACE YOUR ONE-YEARED VINNIE, ALL THE BIG ONES. WELL, THERE'S ONE SO-CALLED PAINTER THAT I HAVE A SERIOUS BEEF WITH. THE GUY WHO PAINTED THIS STUFF. BRITISH GUERRILLA GRAFFITIIST BANKSY, AN ANONYMOUS STREET ARTIST NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN. WELL, FOLKS, BRACE YOURSELF BECAUSE THE BRITISH ARE COMING, THE BRITISH ARE COMING.
BANKSY ANNOUNCED ON HIS WEB SITE HE'S TAKING UP RESIDENCY IN NEW YORK THIS MONTH LAUNCHING A SERIES OF WORKS CALLED "BETTER OUT THAN IN." THE FIRST WORK APPEARED ON ALAN STREET NEAR CANAL. IT SHOWS A CHILD HOLDING A CAN OF SPRAY PAINT STANDING ON ANOTHER CHILD'S BACK BELOW A SIGN THAT READS "GRAS FEET CITY A CRIME."
Stephen: GRAFFITI IS A CRIME. SO, NATION, CALL THE POLICE IF YOU SEE THIS MAN. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, I HAVE GOT ABSOLUTELY ZERO RESPECT FOR THIS ELUSIVE LIMEY STREET RAT. HE'S ANONYMOUS AND HIS ART IS PUBLIC SO THE JERK DOESN'T EVEN PROFIT OFF OF IT. (LAUGHTER) ART BELONGS IN ONE OF TWO PLACES: A MUSEUM OR MOUNTED NEAR THE TOILET IN A BILLIONAIRE'S YACHT. (LAUGHTER) MONET'S WATER LILIES REALLY GETS THE FLOW GOING. NOW, FOR SOME REASON, THE ART WORLD IS ENAMORED BY THIS CRIMINAL AND ANY WALL HE PAINTS ON IS TORN DOWN AND AUCTIONED OFF FOR MILLIONS. FOLKS, THIS TERRIFIES ME. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE LITTLE KNOWN FACT, MY STUDIO HAS WALLS. (LAUGHTER) AND BANKSY'S NEW YORK REIGN OF TERROR DOES NOT END FOR 24 DAYS AND THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR THE FRONT OF MY BUILDING TO BE VANDALIZED AND ITS PROPERTY VALUE TO SKYROCKET. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, I AM SO CONCERNED I HAVE THAT FRAMED OUT A SPECIFIC AREA BANKSY IS FORBIDDEN TO BEGRIME WITH HIS HOODLUM GRAFFITO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO! NO! BANKSY, I KNOW IT'S TEMPTING AS AN ARTIST FOR YOU TO SEE THIS NAKED WALL AND KNOW THAT IT'S OFF LIMITS FOR YOU TO INJECT ONE OF YOUR TRADEMARK INCISIVE BITS OF SUBVERSIVE SOCIAL COMMENTARY OR MAYBE JUST PAINT ME RIDING A SHARK. (LAUGHTER) BUT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU USE THE SPRAY PAINT LEFT UNATTENDED ON THE SIDEWALK BY MY MAINTENANCE STAFF. THOSE WERE THROWN OUT ON MY ORDERS. AND DO NOT ENJOY THE SELECTION OF TEA SANDWICHES AND ROOM TEMPERATURE NEW CASTLE ALE. (LAUGHTER) SO ONCE AGAIN, BANKSY, STAY AWAY FROM MY STUDIO AT 1513 WEST 54th STREET BETWEEN 10th AND 11th ATTITUDE OR NEAR THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IF YOU'RE COMING BY CAR. I'LL BE WATCHING FOR YOU BANKSY, EXCEPT BETWEEN 3:00 AND 4:00 A.M. WHEN OUR SECURITY CAMERAS USUALLY CUT OUT. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
