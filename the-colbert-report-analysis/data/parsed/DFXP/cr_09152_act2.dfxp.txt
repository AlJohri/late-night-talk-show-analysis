(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH FOLKS, YOU KNOW THEY SAY TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT. BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SAY THEY'RE WRONG TWICE. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, THE WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I'M NO FAN OF MUSLIM EXTREMISTS BUT TO FIGHT EXTREMISTS SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO THINK LIKE EXTREMISTS, OR THE VERY LEAST KNOW THEIR DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.
WOULD YOU EXPECT TO SEE PORK ON YOUR BREAKFAST PLATE OR PERHAPS IN YOUR SAN WITCH BUT HOW ABOUT IN YOUR GUNS, AMMUNITION?
Stephen: NO, I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT. PLEASE GO ON.
A COMPANY IN NORTH IDAHO IS SELLING THESE BULLETS, THEY'RE CALLED JIHAWG AMMO. THEY TARGET ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS BECAUSE IN THAT RELIGIOUS ANYTHING MADE WITH PORK IS CONSIDERED UNCLEAN.
Stephen: NO UNCLEAN WESTERN WILL BE ADMIT MOOD PARADISE AN RECEIVE THE 72 VIRGINS THEY ARE PROMISED AFTER DEATH.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. NOW I DID NOT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT THEY HAVE MADE BACON SLIGHTLY MORE BAD FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER) SO FOLKS, A TIP OF MY HAT TO HAMUNITION. YOU SEE NONHALAL BULLETS ARE THE PERFECT WAY TO SEN OUR ENEMY THE MESSAGE THAT WE ONLY LINLTED AT WHEN WE KILLED THEM-- HINTED AT WHEN WE KILLED THEM. AND YOU CAN TRUST THE FOLKS AT JIHAWG BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THEIR WEB SITE THEY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA WHILE SITTING AROUND A CAMP FIRE ENJOYING AN ADULT BEVERAGE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT IS, OF COURSE, ALWAYS HOW YOU GET THE BEST IDEAS. REMEMBER, JONAS SALK CAME UP WITH THE POLIO VACCINE WHILE HUFFING RUST OLIUM AROUND A TRASH CAN FIRE. AND JIHAWG DOES NOT SKIMP ON QUALITY. THEY BRAG THAT THEIR PORCINE COATING IS INFUSED WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY PORK PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA. BECAUSE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING SOMEONE, YOU CANNOT SETTLE FOR SUBSTANDARD PIG SLURRY. MY ONLY WORRY IS THAT NO AMERICAN IS GOING TO WASTE BACON BULLETS ON THEIR ENEMIES. THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO FIRE THEM DIRECTLY INTO THEIR OWN MOUTHS. I KNOW I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR FASTER WAYS TO GET SALTED MEETS INTO MY FACE. BUT AS GOOD AS THEY ARE, BULLETS ARE KIND OF SMALL PORTIONS SO I'M CALL ON JIHAWG AMMO TO STEP IT UP AND INVENT THE HAMGRENADE. FOLKS, A WAG OF MY FINGER AT SEXIEST-- SEXIEST MAN ALIVE GEORGE CLOONEY. HE'S ALWAYS STICKING HIS PERFECTLY FORMED NOSE WHERE IT DOES NOT BELONG. AND NOW HE IS DOING IT WITH TECHNOLOGY.
GEORGE CLOONEY HAS HIS EYES IN THE SKIES. THE ACTOR TELLS THE GUARDIAN THAT HE'S USING A SPY SATELLITE TO TRACK THE DICTATOR OMAR AL-BASHIR. HE KEEPS A WATCH ON THE DICTATOR HE ARMY AN INFORMS ON THEIR MOVEMENT.
Stephen: CLOONEY, NOBODY CARES IF YOU TIE YOUR KITE AND FLY IT OVER AFRICA. LOOK F ARE YOU SERIOUS, IF YOU REALLY WANT ANYONE TO PAY ATTENTION TO AL-BASHIR, PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS AND START DATING HIM. OKAY? MAKE HIM YOUR GO-TO ARM CANDY ON THE RED CARPET. YOU DO THIS, AND IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL THE PRESS GIVES YOU GUYS A CUTE COUPLE'S NAME LIKE GEOMAR AL BALLOONY. IN FACT, I SAY WE SHOULD MAKE ALL OF OUR WANTED CRIMINALS A-LIST LENS MEAT. I MEAN IT TOOK THE CIA OVER A DECADE TO FIND BIN LADENMENT BUT IF THE TMZ HAD BEEN ON THE CASE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IN FOUR DAYS AND GOTTEN AN UPROBE SHOT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
