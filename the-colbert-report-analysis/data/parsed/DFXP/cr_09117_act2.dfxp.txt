Stephen:  WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. NATION IF YOU WIEWCH THIS SHO  YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS LOOKING OUT  FOR AMERICA'S WOMEN. THEY'RE JUGGLING SO MUCH THESE  DAYS-- FAMILY, WORK, AND SO MANY  DIFFERENT BRANDS OF YOGURT. I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHICH ONE  MAKES JAMIE LEE CURTIS POOP. AND WITH ALL THAT PRESSURE, I'M  NOT SURPRISED SO MANY WOMEN HAVE  A DRINKING PROBLEM. SPECIFICALLY, DRINKING THE WRONG  BRAND OF BOTTLED WATER. THAT'S ABOUT TO END, FOLKS. CHECK OUT THIS EXCITING PRODUCT  LAUNCH CHOREOGRAPHED BY THE  FOLKS AT NESTLE. THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST  MOVING BOTTLED WATER THEME  THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE SINCE THE 16-OUNCE D.A. WON THE TONY FOR  ITS HEARTBREAKING PORTRAYAL OF  WILLIE LOMAN. AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO RESOURCE  WATER, AN EXCITING NEW  INTERPRETATION OF TWO HYDROGEN AND ONE OXYGEN ATOMS, AIMED AT  STYLISH HIGHER INCOME WOMEN. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE  CAUGHT IN THE HAMPTONS DRINKING  LAST YEAR'S WATER. AND RESOURCE WATER IS MORE THAN  JUST REFRESHMENT, LADIES. IT WILL HELP YOU ATTAIN TOTAL  ELECTROENLIGHTENMENT UPON I  WOULD NEVER DRINK RESOURCE WATER BECAUSE I'M A DUDE. I ONLY DRINK WATER MEANT FOR  GUYS. THAT'S CALLED BEER. BUT AS A BUSINESSMAN, I DO LOVE  ALL THESE INNOVATIONS IN BOTTLED  WARRANT MARKETING. ANYTHING TO KEEP AMERICANS FROM  DRINKING THE COMMIE WATER  FLOWING OUT OF THEIR COMMUNAL  TAP. BECAUSE I SAY IT'S A SLIPPERY  SLOPE FROM GROUP DRINKING WATER  TO GROUP SHOWERING. NOT IN MY LIFE, BUDDY. NO, RESOURCE WATER IS JUST THE  LATEST MEMBER OF THE NESTLE  FAMILY OF IMPLASTICIZED WATER ALONG WITH ARROWHEAD, DEER PARK,  ICE MOUNTAIN ACQUA PANNA, ACQUA  PANNA, AND ZEPHYR HILLS. NAMING ALL THOSE WATERS MADE ME  THIRSTY. I COULD GO FOR A POLAND SPRINGS. AND POLAND SPRING. FOLKS, WITH THESE PRODUCTS  NESTLE IS HOPING TO CORNER THE  DEMOGRAPHIC THAT MARKETERS CRAVE-- CARBON-BASED LIFE FORMS  AGED ZERO TO ANYTHING. IT'S ALL PART OF THE VISION OF  NESTLE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD,  PETER BRABECK. HERE HE IS EXPLAINING WHY OUR  MOST PRICELESS RESOURCE COULD  USE A PRICE TAG.
( translated ): WATER IS,  OF COURSE, THE MOST IMPORTANT  RAW MATERIAL WE HAVE TODAY IN THE WORLD. IT'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE  SHOULD PRIVATIZE THE NORMAL  WATER SUPPLY FOR THE POPULATION AND THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT  OPINIONS ON THE MATTER. THE ONE OPINION, WHICH I THINK  IS EXTREME, AS A HUMAN BEING,  YOU SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO  WATER. THAT'S AN EXTREME SOLUTION. PERSONALLY, I BELIEVE IT'S  BETTER TO GIVE A FOODSTUFF A  VALUE SO WE'RE ALL AWARE IT HAS ITS PRICE.
Stephen:  THERE IS NO MORE  COMFORTING SPOKESPERSON THAN A  CALCULATING GERMAN SPEAKING MAN OUTLINING HIS PLAN TO CONTROL  THE WORLD'S WATER SUPPLY. AND HE'S RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A LOT OF  GERMAN FANS HERE TONIGHT. AND HE'S RIGHT. WITHOUT PUTTING A PRICE ON IT,  HOW WOULD WE KNOW WE NEED WATER. DEATH? SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,  NESTLE. AT THIS RATE, THERE WON'T BE ANY  BODY OF WATER YOU CAN'T PUT A  PRICE ON, AT LEAST THE ONES THAT AREN'T ALREADY CHOCK FULL OF  YOUR PLASTIC BOTTLES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
