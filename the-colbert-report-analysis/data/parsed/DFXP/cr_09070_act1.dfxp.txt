Stephen: WHOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, PLEASE, SIT DOWN, WE HAVE  TO GET TO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, THE DREADED 2% ACROSS  THE BOARD SEQUESTRATION CUTS  KICKED IN LAST FRIDAY. AND I SAY IT'S GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TIME TO PUT THE GOVERNMENT  ON A DIET. [LAUGHTER] AND JUST LIKE A REAL DIET, THE  BEST WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT IS  TO TAKE A CHEESE GRATER AND JUST SHAVE OFF 2% EVERYWHERE. [LAUGHTER] LOOKS GOOD. LOOKS GOOD. NO ONE IS GOING TO RECOGNIZE YOU  AT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, FORCING OBAMA TO ADDRESS  THE NATIONAL DEBT IS A MORAL  ISSUE. IF WE DON'T CUT EXPENSIVE  THINGS LIKE HEAD START,  CHILDHOOD NUTRITION PROGRAMS, TEACHERS, AND STUDENT LOANS,  WHAT SORT OF FUTURE ARE  WE LEAVING FOR OUR CHILDREN? [LAUGHTER] AND WE KNOW AUSTERITY DURING  ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS WORKS. JUST LOOK AT EUROPE. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU CAN SEE IT THROUGH THE  TEAR GAS. [LAUGHTER] MANY OF THOSE COUNTRIES  STILL EXIST. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, EVERYBODY'S PLAYING  THE BLAME GAME. I BLAME OBAMA FOR THAT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THIS MAN WILL NOT TAKE  THAT BLAME LIKE A MAN.
AND I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN SOME  OF THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM  THAT'S BEEN FLOATING AROUND WASHINGTON THAT SOMEHOW EVEN  THOUGH MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT  I'M BEING REASONABLE, THAT MOST PEOPLE AGREE I'M PRESENTING A  FAIR DEAL THE FACT THAT THEY  DON'T TAKE IT MEANS THAT I SHOULD SOMEHOW, YOU KNOW, DO A  JEDI MIND MELD WITH THESE FOLKS  AND CONVINCE THEM TO DO WHAT'S  RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WHAT? DID YOU HEAR THAT? A JEDI "MIND MELD?"  HE MIXED UP THE JEDI MIND TRICK  WITH THE VULCAN MIND MELD! [LAUGHTER] WHO MAKES THAT MISTAKE? THE TWO ARE AS DIFFERENT AS  GOOD KIRK AND EVIL KIRK FROM  MIRROR MIRROR. SEASON TWO, EPISODE 4. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] BHI THE WAY I KNOW IT'S NOT FROM  MIRROR, MIRROR. FOLKS, NO LETTERS. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, FORGET BENGHAZI GATE. THIS IS BEN KENOBI GATE! [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S NEXT, PRESIDENT OBAMA? HOLDING THE MAJQA' KLINGON RITE  OF PASSAGE ON YAVIN 4? [LAUGHTER] DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT PLANET  YAVIN 4 IS? [LAUGHTER] TRICK QUESTION! IT'S NOT A PLANET! IT'S A MOON! [LAUGHTER] YOU'RE SUCH A GORN. [LAUGHTER] BUT OBAMA'S SCI-FI FLUB, SHOULD  BE THE GOP'S GAIN. AFTER ALL, REPUBLICANS AND NERDS  HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. [LAUGHTER] THEY BOTH LIVE IN FANTASY WORLDS  AND HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RELATE  TO WOMEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   AND SENATE MINORITY LEADER  MITCH MCCONNELL BEARS A STRIKING  RESEMBLANCE TO ADMIRAL  ACKBAR. [LAUGHTER] NATION, YOU KNOW IT'S MY SACRED  DUTY TO PROTECT YOU FROM THOSE  WHO WOULD DESTROY OUR WAY OF  LIFE. THAT WAY OF LIFE? YOU WATCHING TV LIKE YOU'RE  ABOUT TO DO MORE OF RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] JIM? THERE ARE THOSE AMONG US INTENT  ON CHALLENGING OUR MOST SACRED  BELIEFS NO MATTER WHAT THE COST. WE CALL THEM SCIENTISTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S ALIVE!
Stephen: SCIENTISTS LIKE  DOCTOR SKYLARBEHR, Ph.D.
I'M A SCIENTIST THOUGH I  DON'T HAVE MY Ph.D YET.
Stephen: SHE'S THE ENEMY  WITHIN. ♪ ♪  HERE ON MAINE'S MOUNT DESERT  ISLAND IN THE VILLAGE OF  THUMBSVILLE LIFE ON THE COAST HAS ALWAYS BEEN AS GOD INTENDED.
TIDE GOES IN, TIDE GOODS OUT. NEVER A MISCOMMUNICATION.
Stephen: UNTIL THE TODAY AN  HOSK YOUR MISCOMMUNICATION AT  THE LOCAL RED STOP LEFT DEVELOPPAGES CRYING.
WHO HAS THE SCALLOP GUTS.
Stephen: WAS IT ALL PART OF  THE DOCTOR'S PLAN TO DESTROY THE  HUMAN PLACE?
I AM NOT TRYING TO DESTROY  THE HUMAN RACE.
Stephen: OH, NO? NOVEMBER 26, 2012. PROFESSOR GAIL GARWAIT WAS  RETURNING HOME WHEN SHE HAD A  SHOCKING REALIZATION.
HAVING SKIPPED LUNCH I WAS  NOT GOING TO MAKE IT ALL THE WAY  TO SUMMERTIME.
Stephen: IT WAS THEN THAT  SHE SAW THE THUMBSVILLE ONE  STOP.
HOPPED OUT OF CAR, WALKED  AROUND ONCE FOUND A BAG OF  SMARTFOOD POPCORN.
Stephen: SHE DOESN'T KNOW  SHE WAS NOT ALONE. THIS SAY LEGAL SCALLOP DIVER  WITH A PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS.
IF YOU CRASH YOUR CAR DRUNK  AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO HELP  YOU HIDE IT AND EVERYTHING, CAN I DO THAT ON A MINUTE'S NOTICE.
Stephen: GOOD TO KNOW BUT  WHY WAS ANDY MAZE AT THE  THUMBSVILLE ONE STOP THAT DAY AND WHY WAS HE SO DESPERATE?
I SHOW UP IN A INCLUDED OF  DUST, CIRCUMSTANCING AROUND IN A  PANIC TRYING TO FIND SCAR THROAT GET RID OF THE BUCKETS OF  SCALLOP GUTS.
Stephen: IT SEEMS TO DOCTOR  SKYLAR ARRANGED A COVERT  DELIVERY THAT WOULD GO TERRIBLY  WRONG.
BY THE TIME I SAW ANDY HE HAD  DRIVEN ACROSS THE STREET.
I WENT OUT AND SAID DID YOU  WRING THE SCALLOPS WITH YOU.
I SAID I PUT THEM IN YOUR  CAR.
I WAS LIKE IT WASN'T MY CAR. THE CAR WAS GONE.

Stephen: IT WAS ONLY A  MATTER OF TIME MILLION IS  SOMEONE WOULD UNCOVER THE  SECRET.
I SAID DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,  THIS KIND OF (bleep) HAPPENS  TO ME ALL THE TIME.
MAYBE WE'LL MAKE A NEW FRIEND  AFTER THIS, TOO. AND I -- AH.
Stephen: MEANWHILE, GAIL  WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A GRIEWSSOME  DISCOVERY.
I SEE THE WHITE TUBS IN THE  BACK OF THE CAR. WHAT THE HECK. I PEER IN AND SEAT WORDS FORM  MALD HIDE -- FORMALDEHYDE.
IT'S WHAT THEY PUT INTO THE  DEAD PEOPLE.
Stephen: IT WAS MURDER.
ALSO USED TO PRESERVE.
Stephen: SO IT WAS SCIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SITUATION WAS DETEAROR  YAIGHT RAPIDLY. IT WAS TIME FOR THE AUTHORITIES  TO STEP IN. POLICE CHIEF JAMES WILLIS FILED  THE REPORT.
NO, WE DON'T DO ANY --
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE  INVESTIGATION?
I WASN'T A CASE. IT WAS A LOT OF AND FOUND. WE PASSED INFORMATION ALONG. THERE WAS NOTHING FOR POLICEMEN  TO DO.
Stephen: WITH THE PRESS AT  A DEAD END GAIL TOOK MATTERS  INTO HER OWN HANDS.
I WAS CHECKING FACEBOOK AND  TWO OF MY FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK  POSTED THIS WEIRD STORY ANDED IT SAID WHO HAS THE SCALLOP GUTS.
Stephen: WHO? WHO? SO GAIL MADE A CALL TO THE  FISHERMAN'S WIFE MICHELLE.
AT 7:00 THE PHONE RANGE AND  THE VOICES SAID IT'S ME I HAVE  YOUR SCALLOP GUTS.
Stephen: A NICE CONNECTION  UNTIL GAIL LEARNED WHAT WAS  REALLY IN THAT BUCKET.
GONADSP SCALLOP GONADS.
Stephen: YOU MEAN LIKE  BALLS?
VERY MUCH LIKE BALLS.
THIS IS THE GONAD, THE  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS THAT IS WHAT  HER WHOLE LIFE IS FOCUSED ON.
A WOMAN OBSESSED.

I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH  IT.
Stephen: OR IS IT?

Stephen: THEN WEREN'T THE  POLICE RODE TO CLOSE THE CASE?
WE DIDN'T CLOSE THE CASE  BECAUSE WE NEVER OPEN THE CASE.
Stephen: SO IT WASN'T  CLOSED?
THERE IS NO CASE.
Stephen: WITH POLICE IN  DENIAL THE KEY ISSUE OF MOTIVE  WAS UNANSWERED STARTING WITH THE  HENCHMAN.
I WAS ABLE TO GIVE SKYLAR THE  BALLS AND I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE  MEAT AND GIVE THEM TO MY FRIENDS AND THEY GAVE ME LIQUOR.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT IT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY  ANYONE NEEDS A FIVE GALLON  BUCKET OF SCALLOP NAVES. A MOUTHFUL.
I'M CURIOUS. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT SHE'S  DOING WITH IT.
Stephen: ONCE AGAIN THIS  GUY.
HER RESEARCH IS ABOUT  IMPROVING THE REPRODUCTIVE  SUCCESS OF MAINE SCALLOPS.
Stephen: IMPROVING  REPRODUCTIONS THEN MAYBE IT'S  NOT THE BEST IDEAD TO CUT THEIR BALLS OFF. THERE'S A SIMPLER EXPLANATION.
HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS.
I KNEW IT. YOU LIKE --
I'M NOT -- YOU LIKE TO PLAY  GOD.
I'M NOT PLAYING GOD AT ALL. I'M JUST DOING A FEW  EXPERIMENTS.
Stephen: A LONELY LADY  SCIENTISTS WITH FIVE GALLONS OF  SCALLOP GONADS CAN LEAD TO ONLY ONE HORRIFYING REALITY. SCALLOP MAN AN INVINCIBLE HARD  SHELLED MONSTER WITH FREAKISHLY  GIANT NADS.
