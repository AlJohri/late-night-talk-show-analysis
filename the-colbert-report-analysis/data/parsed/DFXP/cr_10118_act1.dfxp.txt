Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WHAT ARE WE DOING? [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WHAT AN EVENING. NOW, FOLKS... FOLKS, I GOT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S BEEN A GREAT SHOW SO FAR, BUT BEFORE WE GO, I WANT TO UPDATE YOU ON MY ONGOING WAR WITH AMAZON. LAST WEEK I BROKE THE STORY OF SOMETHING ABOUT ME. YOU SEE, AMAZON IS IN HEATED CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH MY PUBLISHER HACHETTE. AND AS LEVERAGE, AMAZON IS PREVENTING PREORDERS AND  DELAYING SHIPMENT OF HACHETTE'S MOST POPULAR AUTHORS INCLUDING ME. [AUDIENCE BOOING] OH, DON'T MAKE ME UNLEASH THESE DOGS. FOLKS, THIS IS TERRIBLE. I AM ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS. AND IT'S NOT JUST ME. BECAUSE OF AMAZON'S SCORCHED-EARTH TACTICS, MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCREWED THAN IN "FIFTY SHADES OF GREY." SO I TOLD AMAZON C.E.O. JEFF BEZOS, IT'S GO TIME, LEX LOSER. BEFORE I KNEW IT, MY COURAGEOUS STAND CREATED A FIRESTORM ALL OVER THE INTERNET, AND UNLIKE RIHANNA, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO SHOW SIDE-BOOB. I EVEN OFFERED. NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT I'M GREAT GUY. SO I DID THIS NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR THE FIRST-TIME NOVELISTS LIKE EDAN LEPUCKI, WHOSE HACHETTE BOOK "CALIFORNIA" COULD NOT BE PRE-ORDERED ON AMAZON, A DEATH SENTENCE FOR A NEW BOOK. SO I ASKED DO YOU GO TO COLBERTNATION.COM AND PREORDER "CALIFORNIA" FROM POWELL'S BOOKS. NATION, YOU PREORDERED JUST AS I PREORDERED YOU DO. AS OF TODAY YOU HEROS HAVE BOUGHT OVER 6,400 COPIES OF CALIFORNIA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN FACT, YOU HAVE MADE CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER-ONE BOOK ON POWELL'S FOR WEEKS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY SHOW AMAZON THAT WE WILL NOT LICK THEIR MONOPOLY BOOT, OR ANY OF THEIR MONOPOLY PIECES? IF WE PUT "CALIFORNIA" ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BESTSELLER LIST. WE ARE CLOSE. NATION, I WANT YOU TO GO TO COLBERTNATION.COM AND PREORDER THIS BOOK LIKE AMAZON DOESN'T WANT YOU TO. OR PREORDER IT FROM OTHER PLACES LIKE PARNASSUS BOOKS, POLITICS AND PROSE, RAINY DAY OR GO TO YOUR LOCAL BOOKSTORE, WALK UP TO THE COUNTER AND JUST CLICK ON THE CLERK. OKAY. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED THAT. AND TELL THEM, "I WANT TO PREORDER "CALIFORNIA" BY EDAN LEPUCKI." ACT NOW AND IT WILL HAPPEN EVEN SOONER. GOOD NIGHT. NATION, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, THERE'S NOTHING HUMBLE ABOUT MY OPINION. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FIRST UP, FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET THAT I HAVE ALWAYS FELT A DEEP CONNECTION WITH TEXAS SENATOR AND JOE McCARTHY TRIBUTE HEAD TED CRUZ. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S ONE THING ABOUT SENATOR CRUZ THAT BOTHERS ME. IT'S HIS NAME, RAFAEL EDWARD CRUZ. IT SOUNDS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, CANADIAN. [LAUGHTER] IT TURNS OUT I HAVE EXCELLENT CANADAR.
SENATOR TED CRUZ HAS RENOUNCED HIS CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP. THE TEXAS REPUBLICAN WAS BORN NORTH OF THE BORDER. HE DISCOVERED HE HELD DUALSHIP LAST YEAR.
TED CRUZ NOW OFFICIALLY ALL-AMERICAN, SHEDDING HIS CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP.
Stephen: SO A TIP OF THE HAT TO SENATOR CRUZ FOR HIS GREAT SHOW OF PATRIOTISM. IF YOU ASK ME, THERE'S NOTHING MORE AMERICAN THAN NOT BEING FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY. WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO ALSO GIVE TED CRUZ A WAG OF MY FINGER, BECAUSE THE WAY TED CRUZ WENT ABOUT BECOMING A NOT-CANADIAN WAS SO CANADIAN. HIS CANA-DECTOMY WAS PERFORMED WITH A SIMPLE CERTIFICATE OF RENUNCIATION ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT. A CERTIFICATE JUST SAYING HE'S NOT CANADIAN. HELL, I GOT THOSE. THE PRINTER IN MY OFFICE CHURNS 'EM OUT 24/7. I EVEN GOT A TWO-PLY VERSION IN THE BATHROOM. COME ON, SENATOR, NO PIECE OF PAPER CAN WIPE THE CANADA OFF YOU. I'VE VISITED TORONTO ONCE 20 YEARS AGO AND EVERY NOW AND THEN I STILL SAY I'M SORRY. NO, TO BECOME 100% AMERICAN, TED CRUZ NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING RADICALLY UNCANADIAN. HE NEEDS PUNCH A MOOSE OR PAY FOR HIS OWN HEALTH CARE. AND I CAN HELP. I CAN HELP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M HERE TO HELP BECAUSE I'M A TRAINED LUDOVICO THERAPIST. I'VE ADMINISTERED CANADIAN DEPROGRAMMING BEFORE. JIM? [SCREAMING] ♪ IT'S BEEN ONE WEEK YOU LOOKED AT ME ♪ DROPPED YOUR ARMS TO YOUR SIDES AND SAID I'M SORRY
STOP IT! THIS IS SICK!
Stephen: NOW THANKS TO CONDITIONING, EVERY TIME HE HEARS CELINE DION, HE BECOMES NAUSEOUS, LIKE A TRUE AMERICAN. NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM A HUGE FAN OF LED ZEPPELIN. I AM A SUCKER FOR THEIR UNIQUE MIX OF BLUES, ROCK AND DRUIDS, WHICH IS WHY I AM SO ANGRY. JIM.
IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK 'N' ROLL SONGS OF ALL TIME, BUT WAS THE INTRO TO LED ZEPPELIN'S "STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN" STOLEN FROM THE 1960s BAND SPIRIT? ACCORDING TO AN ATTORNEY FOR SPIRIT'S FORMER LEAD GUITARIST, THE ZEPPELIN CLASSIC SOUNDS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO SPIRIT'S SONG "TAURUS."
Stephen: LED ZEPPELIN IS BEING ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING "STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN" 43 YEARS AFTER IT CAME OUT. THE   PLAINTIFF NEEDED TIME TO LISTEN TO IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. IF YOU'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE '60s ROCK BAND SPIRIT, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU WERE NEVER IN THE '60s ROCK BAND SPIRIT. BUT THE ESTATE OF THEIR LEAD SINGER RANDY CALIFORNIA, SEEN HERE, LOOKING LIKE THAT, CLAIMS THAT LED ZEPPELIN  RIPPED HIM OFF. YOU DECIDE. HERE'S LED ZEPPELIN'S "STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN." ♪♪  ♪♪ [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] NOW HERE'S SPIRIT'S SONG "TAURUS."  ♪♪ I DON'T KNOW WHAT LEGALLY CONSTITUTES PLAGIARISM, ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY BOTH MADE ME WANT TO COUPLE'S SKATE. [LAUGHTER] SO I HAVE NO CHOICE TO GIVE A WAG OF MY THINGER TO MY FORMER HEROES, LED ZEPPELIN. I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE THINKING, MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE. AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE HARD ON ZEP?  WELL GREG, EAT HOT FACT.
TAURUS WAS RELEASED IN 1968 THREE YEARS BEFORE "STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN." JIMMY PAIGE SAYS HE WROTE IT IN A COTTAGE IN WALES BACK IN 1970. BUT A LAWYER REPRESENTING RANDY CALIFORNIA, WHOSE BAND TOURED WITH LED ZEPPELIN IN 1969, SAYS PAIGE STOLE THE OPENING RIFF.
Stephen: AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, PAIGE ALSO APPARENTLY STOLE THE NECK FROM ONE OF SPIRIT'S GUITARS. WELL, THIS "COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN" HAS LEFT ME "DAZED AND CONFUSED." IT'S A REAL "HEARTBREAKER," BECAUSE I HAD A "WHOLE LOTTA LOVE" FOR ZEP. BUT "HEY, HEY, WHAT CAN I DO?" IN HERE, THE "LEVEE HAS BROKEN," "BLACK DOG." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NO LONGER... NO LONGER WILL I CELEBRATE SEPTEMBER AS ZEPTEMBER. I'LL HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH ROCTOBER, TULLVEMBER, STONESUARY AND BARCH. [LAUGHTER] SO, ZEP, THAT'S IT. INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO YOU, I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO SPIRIT'S "12 DREAMS OF DOCTOR SARDONICUS." ♪♪  ♪♪ [LAUGHTER] OH YEAH,. OH, YEAH, I'M EVENTUALLY GOING TO GET INTO THIS. JIMMY, CRANK IT UP. NOW CRANK IT DOWN. ALL RIGHT. NOW JUST CRANK IT OFF. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
