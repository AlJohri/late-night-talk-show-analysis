Stephen: FOLKS -- -- THANK YOU. FOLKS, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW. YOU KNOW, I HAVE MADE NO SECRET OVER THE YEARS THAT I AM A HUGE FAN OF BILL O'REILLY HE IS MY MENTOR, MY INSPIRATION, MY SAFE WORD I READ ALL OF HIS BOOKS, KILLING KENNEDY, KILLING KENNEDY, KILLING JESUS. HE IS A LITERARY MASTER OF THE NONSURPRISE ENDING. AND PAPA BEAR IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST GUYS OUT THERE. BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE OTHER PEOPLE ARE DUMB, BECAUSE HE HIRED SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO THAT. CORRESPONDENT JESSE WATTERS WHO DOES A REOCCURRING SEGMENT WATTERS WORLD NAMED OF COURSE AFTER WATER WORLD, ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED FILMS OF ALL TIME. IN THE SEGMENT, WATTERS DEMONSTRATES HOW LITTLE YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS AND TO EMPHASIZE THAT HE ADDS HELPFUL FILM CLIPS, HERE IS A TASTE.
MILEY CYRUS GAVE A CONCERT IN RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY. SO WE SENT WATTERS THERE ARMED WITH FOUR PICTURES OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. I'M GOING TO HOLD UP SOME PHOTOGRAPHS. OF FAMOUS PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS?

Stephen: NOW NOTICE HOW WATTERS BLENDS INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM AND SMASH CUTS IN A WAY THAT MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT THE NEWS AND ALSO THINK "IS MY CAT STEPPING ON THE REMOTE?" NATION, I HAVE TO ADMIT SOMETHING. HERE, HERE ON THE REPORT EVERY NIGHT NAILING POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS, SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT I HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH EVERY DAY FOLKS. BUT WATTERS WORLD HAS SHOWN ME I CAN FEEL SUPERIOR TO AVERAGE AMERICANS AS WELL. OF COURSE I CAN'T GO INTERVIEW PEOPLE MYSELF BECAUSE I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION WHERE I DON'T WANT TO. BUT I DO HAVE ONE EMPLOYEE WHO IS PERFECT FOR THE JOB. MY BUILDING MANAGER TAD. HE'S GOT ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT JESSE WATTERS DOES. HE REFLECTS LIGHT. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. SO I ALSO--  (APPLAUSE) I ALSO SENT TAD UP TO LIBERAL COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TO SEE JUST HOW MISINFORMED TODAY'S YOUTH ARE IN THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF MY  LONG-RUNNING SERIES, TAD'S TURF.
