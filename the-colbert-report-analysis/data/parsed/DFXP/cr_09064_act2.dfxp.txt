Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERY. ANYONE IN THE TV BUSINESS KNOWS  BEST WAY TO CREATE A HIT SHOW IS  NOT TO THE CREATE ONE. INSTEAD, IMPORT A HIT FROM  OVERSEAS. NBC'S "THE OFFICE" CAME FROM  BRITAIN'S "THE OFFICE," AND  "HOMELAND" CAME FROM THE ISRAELI SHOW "HATUFIM."  AND "CHRIS MATTHEWS'S HARDBALL"  WAS ADAPTED FROM THE IRISH  CHILDREN'S PROGRAM "THE VERY ANGRY POTATO." [LAUGHTER] WELL, I'VE GOT MY EYE ON A  WILDLY POPULAR PROGRAM FROM  NORWAY CALLED "NATIONAL FIREWOOD NIGHT" WHICH CONSISTED MOSTLY OF  PEOPLE IN PARKAS CHATTING AND  CHOPPING IN THE WOODS AND THEN EIGHT HOURS OF A FIRE BURNING IN  A FIREPLACE. [LAUGHTER] IT DESTROYED THE OTHER TOP  NORWEGIAN SHOWS LIKE "SO YOU  THINK YOU CAN WATCH PAINT DRY?" [LAUGHTER] AND THE AMAZING GLAISH RACE. [LAUGHTER] AND GET THIS ALMOST TWENTY  PERCENT OF THE POPULATION TUNED  IN. TWENTY PERCENT! THE LAST TIME THAT MANY  AMERICANS WATCHED A HUNK OF  WOOD, HE WAS PLAYING OPPOSITE SANDRA BULLOCK. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, IN JUST 12 HOURS, YOU  ARE NEVER GOING TO CAPTURE THE  TRUE DEPTH AND NUANCE OF CHOPPING, DRYING AND STACKING  WOOD WHICH IS WHY MANY  NORWEGIANS PREFER THE BEST SELLING BOOK THE SHOW IS BASED  ON, SOLID WOOD, ALL ABOUT THE  CHOPPING, DRYING AND STACKING WOOD AND THE SOUL OF WOOD  BURNING. IT'S AVAILABLE ON KINDLE AND AS  KIND LING. OF COURSE, I'VE KNOWN THE APPEAL  OF TV FIRE FOR AGES. ONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING  CHARACTERS ON THIS SHOW HAS BEEN  MY FIREPLACE FLAMY T. FIRE. I USED TO HAVE A REAL FIRE IN  THERE BUT I GOT SHUT DOWN BY BIG  BROTHER FIRE MARSHAL JUST BECAUSE HIT NO CHIMNEY AND THE  CARBON MONOXIDE WAS KILLING MY  AUDIENCE. [LAUGHTER] BUT THERE'S ONE THING I DON'T  GET, FOLKS. PART OF THE REASON WHY THE SHOW  IS SUCCESSFUL ISES BUT IT'S  GIVEN OLDER NORWEGIAN MEN PERMISSION TO REVEAL THEIR  DEEPEST THOUGHTS WHILE SEEMINGLY  DISCUSSING FIREWOOD. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, THERE'S NO DEEP FEELINGS  WHEN YOU ARE TALKING WOOD. IT'S JUST WOOD. YOU KNOW, YOU CUT IT UP AND  STACK IT AND BURN IT. PERSONALLY I SPLIT INTO QUARTERS  BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MY DAD TAUGHT  ME. STACK IT LOOSELY ENOUGH THAT A  SQUIRREL CAN GET THROUGH BUT  TIGHT ENOUGH THAT THE CAT CANNOT  FOLLOW. TRY TELLING THAT TO YOUR SON HE  HAS NO TIME FOR IT. HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT  WOOD BECAUSE HE CONVERTED TO  GAS. SO YOU JUST STACK FIREWOOD BY  YOURSELF AND NEVER SEE YOUR SON  AND THEN THERE YOU ARE WITH ALL THIS WOOD AND -- [LAUGHTER] AND YET NO WARMTH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT BURNS. AND IT BURNS. AND THEN IT'S GONE. [ LAUGHTER ] ASHES IN THE WIND. [ LAUGHTER ] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] I MISS YOU. [LAUGHTER] I MISS YOU WHEN I'M WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] AND INTO THE FIRE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY SEEMS LIKE A
