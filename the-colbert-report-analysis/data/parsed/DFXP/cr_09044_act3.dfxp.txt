[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK BEGUN  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  ABOUT TRADITIONAL CULTURES  CALLED "THE WORLD UNTIL YESTERDAY."  PERFECT, THAT'S AS FAR BACK AS I  CAN REMEMBER. PLEASE WELCOME JARED DIAMOND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOUR A GEOGRAPHY PROFESSION  ERROR AT UCLA, A MACARTHUR  GENIUS AWARD WINNER, A PULL LIGHTER PRIZE WINNER FOR YOUR  BOOK "GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL."  YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE WORLD UNTIL YESTERDAY:  WHAT CAN  WE LEARN FROM TRADITIONAL  SOCIETIES."  WHAT CAN WE LEARN? BY TRADITIONAL DO YOU MEAN A MAN  MARRIED TO A WOMAN, 2 HAD THE 4  KIDS, WHITE PICKET FENCE IN THE SUBURBS AS GOD INTENDS?
I MEAN SOMETHING DIFFERENT BY  TRADITIONAL SOCIETY, I MEAN THE  SOCIETIES THAT WERE ALL SOCIETIES AROUND THE WORLD UNTIL  RELATIVELY RECENTLY WHEN  POPULATION GREW.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  RECENTLY?
FIRST STATE GOVERNMENT WAS  5400 YEARS AGO IN THE FERTILE  CRESCENT AND IN LARGE PARTS OF UNITED STATES, RURAL AREAS WE'RE  LIVING LARGELY TRADITIONAL  TODAY.
Stephen: THERE ARE PARTS OF  UNITED STATES THAT LIVE AS WE  LIVED 5,000 YEARS?
THERE ARE PARTS OF THE UNITED  STATES WHERE SOME THINGS.
WE WENT TO MONTANA WE SPEND  OUR VACATION. IF THERE'S AN ARGUMENT BETWEEN  NEIGHBORING RANCHERS THEY DON'T  CALL IN LAWYERS OR THE POLICE THEY SETTLE IT THEMSELVES AS  PEOPLE DID TRADITIONALLY.
Stephen: WOULD YOU CALL  THEM PRIMITIVE OR ORIGINAL  SOCIETIES -- SOCIETIES?
IT'S NO LONGER POLITCALLY  CORRECT TO SAY PRIMITIVE.
Stephen: THENSAY PRIMITIVE. THE GUYS WITH THE BONES THROUGH  THE NOSE. WE DON'T PLAY IT SAFE ON THIS  SHOW. WHAT CAN I LEARN FROM THEM. I'M THE ONE WITH THE  CIVILIZATION, SHOULDN'T THEY BE  LEARNING FROM ME?
THEY CAN LEARN BEFORE YOU BUT  THEY BRING UP YOUR CHILDREN TO  BE INDEPENDENT, SELF CONFIDENT SOCIALLY SKILLED.
Stephen: MY CHILDREN ARE  INDEPENDENT. THEY HAVE iPHONES. CAN I GET THEM WHEN I NEED TO. THEY CAN GO IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THAT ILL ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM. IN NEW NEW GUINEA WHERE KIDS  DON'T HAVE iPHONES THEY MAKE  THE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. OLD AGE PLAYS OUT MORE HAPPILY  IN THEIR SOCIETY.
Stephen: HOW LONG DO THEY  LIVE? 32?
YOU ARE CORRECT. THERE'S THE PROBLEM.
Stephen: THAT IS NOT A  SMALL PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD MONTHS  AGO. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE CONNECT. THE AVERAGE LIFESPAN IS SHORTER  BUT IN THEIR OLD AGE THEY ARE  NOT LONELY. THEY ARE LIVING NEXT TO THEIR  CHILDREN AND THEIR FRIENDS. THAT'S UNUSUAL IN THE UNITED  STATES.
HOW MANY OF THESE TRADITIONAL  SOCIETIES ARE THERE IN THE  WORLD?
CAN I GO FIND THEM IN THE  WORLD?
THERE ARE LARGELY PLACES LESS  SKILLED.
IF I WANT THERE WITH AN  ELECTRIC CAN OPENER WOULD THEY  WORSHIP ME AS A GOD?
AS VAN KAMP THE KING OF  BEANS?
WHAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY DO  IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT A USE FOR  THE ELECTRIC CAN OPENER IN THE ABSENCE OF CANS. THEY MIGHT TRY STICKING IT  THROUGH THEIR NOSE OR IN THEIR  EARS. WHAT GOOD IS THAT WITHOUT A CAN?
Stephen: THAT'S HOW I GET  THEM. I SELL THEM THE OPENER AND LEASE  THEM THE CANS. SOFTWARE MODEL. IT'S HOW BILL GATES GOT RIX. I UNDERSTAND IN ONE OF SOCIETIES  YOU STUDY THEY STRANGLE WIDOWS?
THAT'S TRUE AMONG THE PEOPLE  OF --
Stephen: SORRY TO HEAR  ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND, COME OVER  HERE.
WIDOW STRANGLING IS NOT  INVOLUNTARY. THE WIDOW -- SERIOUS, THE WIDOW  CALLS UPON HER BRERNLINGS AND IF  THEY ARE NOT THERE, HER SONS TO STRANGLE HER. THIS IS VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF  WIDOW.
Stephen: AS THEY ARE  CRUSHING HER WINDPIPE HOW DO  THEY HEAR HER SAY KEEP STRANGLING ME.
SHE SAYS IT AT THE BEGINNING.
Stephen: AND AFTER THAT  THAT YOU ARE COMMITTED.
YES. I WANT TOLL EXPLAIN HOW  UNSTRANGLED ONE ZIT. WITH A ROPE AROUND THE NECK --  YOU PULL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
Stephen: SO IT'S HUMANE? WOULD YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP  AGAIN LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO  FIGHT ME. THIS WAY LIKE THIS. YOU LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE MASCOT  OF THE FIGHTING IRISH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I WENT TO UCLA.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. YOU WERE GREAT IN LINCOLN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. JARED DIAMOND, THE BOOK IS "THE  WORLD UNTIL YESTERDAY."  WE'LL
