Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WON FIVE TONYS. JUST ONE MORE AND THAT WILL BE SIX. PLEASE WELCOME AUDRA McDONALD. (APPLAUSE) AUDRA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE SHOW.
I HAVE A GOOD TIME ON YOUR SHOW.
Stephen: I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW SHOW, LADY DAY AT EMMERSON'S BAR AND GRILL, YOU PLAY BILLIE HOLIDAY.
BILLIE HOLIDAY WAS ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC JAZZ SINGERS OF THE LAST CENTURY, BASICALLY. AND THE SHOW TAKES PLACE IN MARCH OF 1959, ABOUT FOUR MONTHS BEFORE SHE DIED. AND SHE WAS A BIT, SHE WAS DRUG ADDICTED AND SHE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC BUT SHE WAS ALSO AN AMAZING SINGER. AND SO THE SHOW TAKES PLACE AS A CONCERT THAT SHE'S TRYING TO GIVE RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF HER LIFE. AND SHE TELLS STORIES AND TRIES TO GET TO THE CONCERT AND DOESN'T QUITE MAKE IT AT THE END.
Stephen: HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH THIS, OKAY. IS THAT I HAVE SEEN YOU DO A COUPLE OF THESE SONGS AND YOU'RE TREMENDOUS. BUT MY FEAR IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DRAW YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THE JAZZ LIFESTYLE WITH THIS SHOW. (LAUGHTER)
THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING.
Stephen: NO, NO, BECAUSE JAZZ, I DON'T-- I DON'T GO TO JAZZING. BUT JAZZ LEADS TO JAZZ CIGARETTES. AND THEN SWINGING OF HIPS AND BOOGIE WOOGIE AND YOU KNOW. YOU'RE CORRUPTING THE YOUTH OF AMERICA.
ACTUALLY I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR SHOW IS NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T KNOW BILLIE HOLIDAY AND LOVED HER MUSIC, THEY ARE GETTING A CHANCE TO REEXPERIENCE HER AND HER MUSIC AND HER LEGACY BUT ALSO FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING, THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORY LESSON ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS LAST CENTURY.
Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU AND BILLIE HOLIDAY HAVE IN COMMON. BECAUSE SHE WAS A TORTURED INDIVIDUAL.
YES.
Stephen: YOU SEEM PRETTY HEALTHY.
YEAH, I DON'T THINK I WAS AS TORTURED AS BILLIE. I, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A SINGER AND BE NERVOUS ABOUT PERFORMING AND ALL THAT BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY GO TO DRUGS TO CALM ME DOWN. I GO TO REESES PEANUT BUTTER CUPS IS MY THING.
Stephen: IT'S A SLOWER KILLER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BUT IT WILL GET THREW.
YES, YES.
Stephen: IT WILL DO THE JOB. WHY DO WE, WHY DO WE REVERE THESE SINGERS? HERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM I'VE GOT WITH THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. WE KEEP ON REVERING SINGERS WHO HAVE THESE DEMONS, WHO DIE YOUNG. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THEM SO THAT DRAWS US IN? IT'S THE STORY BECOMES SO ATTRACTIVE TO US.
OF COURSE IT DOES. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW BECAUSE AS A SINGER SOMEONE LIKE BILLIE HOLIDAY, YOU KNOW, ALSO SOMEONE LIKE AMY WINEHOUSE OR WHITNEY HOUSTON WHO HAVE HAD ISSUES LIKE THIS. THEY WERE ALL SUCH INDIVIDUAL TALENTS. AND SO DEEPLY CONNECTED WITH WHO THEY WERE AS PEOPLE. AND THAT IS WHAT THEIR MUSIC BROUGHT FORTH. AND SO PEOPLE I THINK CAN CONNECT TO THAT ON A REAL SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SPIRITUAL AND HUMAN LEVEL. AND SO IT'S JUST A CONNECTION THAT HAPPENS. AND SO THEY, LIKE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE RAW IN A WAY, THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NERVE ENDINGS. THEY ARE JUST SORT OF COMPLETELY RAW AND ARE EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING AT A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL THAN WE ARE SO THAT I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE TO.
Stephen: OKAY.
DOES THAT BOTHER YOU.
Stephen: WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A MUSICAL ABOUT AMY GRANT OR ANNE MURRAY OR SOMEBODY --
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A MUSICAL ABOUT THEM AS WELL.
Stephen: OKAY.
MAYBE THERE COULD BE A FANTASY MUSICAL AMY GRANT, ANN MURRAY AND BILLIE HOLIDAY.
Stephen: AND THEY ARE A THROUPLE. (LAUGHTER) WELL-- WILL YOU PLEASE-- ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO SOME JAZZ AT US?
I CAN THROW A LITTLE JAZZ, BILLIE CAN THROW A LITTLE JAZZ YOUR WAY.
Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE A POWERFUL OPERATIC VOICE. SHE HAS A VOICE THAT IS MADE FRAIL THROUGH TIME AND ABUSE. HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT?
IT'S BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT. I'VE BEEN STUDYING HER VOICE FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING MY VOICE-- BECAUSE HER VOICE IS SMALLER AND DIDN'T HAVE A LARGE RANGE. SO IT'S BEEN-- I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO HER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND STUDYING HER. AND-- .
Stephen: POUNDING THE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.
POUNDING THEM HARD. I SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CAT DURING THE DAY TRYING TO IMITATE HER. AND I TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE HER, YOU KNOW, I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT LIKE HER IF I WANTED TO.
Stephen: SURE.
MOTHER ABBOTT WOULD SAY TO YOU GOD BLESS YOU MY CHILD AND BILLIE HOLIDAY MEANING THE SAME THING WOULD SAY LIKE, "YOU'RE THE BEST (BLEEP) I EVER MET."
Stephen: I TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY AUDRA McDONALD.
