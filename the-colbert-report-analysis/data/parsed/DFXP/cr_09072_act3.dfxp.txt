Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ARTIST  WHO DOES IMPRESSIONIS. FOR WAL-MART SHOPPERS. HIS PAINTEDDINGS COST $6.99 FOR  A PACK OF SIX. PLEASE WELCOME BRENDAN  O'CONNELL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. O'CONNELL THANK YOU FOR  COMING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: YOU ARE AN  AMERICAN PAINTER TRADITIONALLY  TRAINED.
MORE OR LESS.
Stephen: MORE OR LESS. LET'S SAY MORE. ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAPTURE THEMES OF EVERY DAY  LIFE AND YOU'VE CHOSEN TO PAINT  SCENES FROM WAL-MART.
I STARTED PAINTING WAL-MARTS  EIGHT YEARS AGO.
Stephen: DID THEY KNOW?
WELL --
Stephen: LET SHOW THE  PEOPLE WHAT I MEAN. JIM, PUT UP ONE OF THESE. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.
OKAY.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF YOUR  PAINTINGS? WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO PAINT A  RACK OF JIF?
I JUST KIND OF LIKED THE  COLORS, PATTERNS SHAPES. I'VE BEEN PAINTING WAL-MART FOR  ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AND WATCHING  PEOPLE AND GOING IN AND PHOTOGRAPHING AND THEY KEPT  ASKING ME TO LEAVE.
Jon: WERE YOU GOING IN  THERE WITH AN EASEEL?
I WAS GOING WITH A CAME ARE  AND I WOULD TAKE PICTURES OF THE  ENVIRONMENT AND THEN THEY SAID IF YOU CONTINUE DO THAT YOU ARE  GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE.
Stephen: SO YOU ARE NOT  ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOS IN  WAL-MART.
MOST RETAIL ENVIRONMENTS  DON'T ALLOW TO YOU TAKE PHOTOS?
Jon: WHY?
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY THINK  THEY ARE LOSING TRADE SECRETS.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU CAN'T  LET OUT HOW THESE ARE STACKED. [LAUGHTER] THIS REMINDS ME IMMEDIATELY OF  COURSE OF LIKE ANDY WARHOL'S  SOUP CAN BUT IT WAS A SINGULAR  OBJECT. IT WAS LIKE OBJETDAR AND HAD A  SYNTHETIC SUBJECTIVENESS. THIS HAS AN AGGRESSIVE QUALITY  THAT TURNS POP ART INTO CONSUMER  ART. NOW IF -- DOES WHAT I JUST SAID  MEAN ANYTHING?
NOT NECESSARILY BUT -- [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: GOOD BECAUSE I WAS  JUST -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WAS JUST GRABBING WORDS OUT OF  THE AIR THERE.
WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING  IS WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO  BRANDS. I LIKE THE VIEW OF THE WORLD  PUSHING THE CART AND OUT OF THE  CORNER OF YOUR EYES FIVE MILES PER HOUR YOU SEE A BLURRED  VISION OF THE WORLD.
Stephen: THERE'S MY BLACK  DIAMOND SMOKED ALMOND THAT'S MY  BRAND.
YOU GET MINIMAL INFORMATION  AND PEOPLE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU  ARE REPRESENTING.
Stephen: LET'S GO TO THE  NEXT ONE HERE, JAMES. ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS THIS?
THIS IS THE CHECK OUT AISLE  OF THE NORTH BERGEN, NEW JERSEY,  WAL-MART.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS WHEN THEY ALLOWED ME TO  HAVE A FETEO SHOOT THERE AND HIS  A CHERRY PICKER AND PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER AND WE PHOTOGRAPHED  THIS THING. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS YOU  GIVE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF  INFORMATION. THIS WHOLE EXERCISE WAS TRYING  TO PUT AS LITTLE PAINT ON THE  CANVAS.
Stephen: IT'S AN  IMPRESSIONIST VERSION OF A  PARADE.
THEY WERE PAINTING IN PARIS  AND I FEEL LIKE I'M PAINTING THE  AISLES OF WAL-MART.
Stephen: LET'S GO TO THE  NEXT ONE HERE. NOW -- IS EVERYONE WHO SHOPS AT  WAL-MART SEXY? BECAUSE I'LL GO THERE MORE OFTEN  IF THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.
THAT'S MY WIFE.
Stephen: OH, IT IS.
NO. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAD VARIOUS MODELS OVER THE  YEARS GO IN AND I PAID THEM TO  SHOP BASICALLY. SO THAT'S HOW THE SERIES BEGAN. I HAD THE CLASSIC AMERICAN  BLONDE SHOPPING IN WAL-MART.
Stephen: LET'S GO TO THE  NEXT ONE. OKAY. IS THIS CALLED US.
GREAT BIG US.
Stephen: I LOVE THIS ONE. IS THERE ANYWAY YOU COULD -- THE  ONLY THING THAT WOULD MAKE IT  BETTER IS CAN I CLICK ON THE PAINTING AND PURCHASE THESE  ITEMS?
I SOMETIMES SNACK WHILE  PAINTING. IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY BIG. THIS ONE IS LIKE SEVEN FEET BY  EIGHT FEET.
Stephen: HOW MUCH DO THESE  THINGS GO FOR?
THAT IS WORTH $40,000.
Stephen: $40,000 WHASMS IS  THE LOW END?
THE SMALL ONE GOES FOR  $1,000.
Stephen: OKAY. COULD PEOPLE WHO SHOP AT  WAL-MART AFFORD THE PAINTINGS  YOU MAKE OF THEM? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT  THE -- HALF THE PEOPLE WHO BUY  THE PAINTINGS HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A PIECE OF CONTEMPORARY ART  BEFORE AND THE OTHER HALF SPEND  $100,000 EVERY YEAR. WHAT I LIKE IS IT'S A SERIES  THAT SEEMS TO HAVE A BROAD  SPECTRUM OF INTEREST.
Stephen: YOU ARE ABOUT TO  GET A LOT MORE INTEREST BECAUSE  YOU ARE GETTING THE COLBERT BUMP TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TODAY YOU ARE PAINTING WAL-MART. THIS TIME NEXT WEEK YOU ARE  PAINTING AT WHOLE FOODS! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. BRENDAN O'CONNELL, PAINTER OF  WAL-MART. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
