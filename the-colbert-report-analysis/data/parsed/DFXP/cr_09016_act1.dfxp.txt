AND GETTING READY FOR  HALLOWEEN, IF ARE YOU LIKE  MOST AMERICANS YOU'RE  ALREADY FILLED WITH CANDY. AND MY GUEST, MITCH DANIELS  IS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF  INDIANA WHERE THE WIND GOES  SWEEPING DOWN THE PLAINS ♪ ♪ ANONYMOUS SOURCE SAY MITT  ROMNEY USES SPRAY TAN. THOSE ANONYMOUS SOURCES,  ANYONE WITH EYES. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS "THE COLBERT  REPORT."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. THAT FERVENT CHANTING OF MY  NAME WILL HOLD ME OVER UNTIL  I CAN GET HOME AND CHANT IT  INTO A MIRROR. (LAUGHTER)  NATION, WE ARE A MERE 12  DAYS AWAY FROM THE ELECTION. AND IT IS MY SOLEMN  OBLIGATION AS A NEWSMAN TO  BRING YOU THE MOST CUTTING  EDGE, BASELESS DECIMATIONS OF WHO IS GOING TO WIN. NOW THIS MUCH WE KNOW,  FOLKS. THE ELECTION COULD BE SWUNG  BY ONE KEY VOTING BLOC.
WOMEN!
Stephen: YES! IT'S THE LADIES! WHO ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE  FOR? WELL, ACCORDING TO A NEW  REPORT ON CNN.COM, WOMEN  VOTE BASED ON THEIR OFLATION  CYCLE. (LAUGHTER)  THE STUDY SAYS THAT WHEN  SINGLE WOMEN ARE OVULATTING  THEY FEEL SEXIER AND  THEREFORE LEAN MORE TOWARD LIBERAL ATTITUDES ON  ABORTION AND MARRIAGE  EQUALITY. WHICH IS WHY INSTEAD OF  E-MAILS, OBAMA IS JUST  SENDING LATE NIGHT TEXTS  THAT SAY "YOU UP?  FOLKS. --   (APPLAUSE)  THAT MAKES HIM THE COMMANDER  IN BOOTY CALLS. FOLKS, I THINK THIS STUDY IS  BULL. AND CNN KNOWS IT BECAUSE  THEY PULLED THE ARTICLE  SAYING IT DID NOT MEET THEIR  EDITORIAL STANDARDS. DAMN STRAIGHT. THIS STUDY IS OFFENSIVE. ALL WOMEN ARE LIKE MINDLESS  HORMONE ZOMBIES FOLLOWING  PHEROMONE TRAILS LIKE SO  MANY WORKER ANTS TO THE  POLES? NO, COME ON, IT'S THE 21st  CENTURY. WOMEN DON'T MAKE DECISIONS  BASED ON WHAT'S DOWN HERE. THEY MAKE DECISION ON WHAT'S  UP HERE. THE SHAPE OF THEIR SKULLS,  OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  YOU SEE PHRENOLOGY TELLS US  THAT IF WOMEN LACK A  PROMINENT OCCIPITAL RIDGE,  OKAY, RIGHT ACROSS THIS AREA, THAT MEANS THEY ESCHEW  CAUSALITY, A PROPENSITY SEEN  HERE IN THE SKULL OF THIS  OCTOROON MURDERER. OKAY, NOW OF COURSE THE  SIMPLEST WAY TO PREDICT A  WOMAN'S POLITICAL LEANS,  THROW THEM INTO THE RIVER. IF THEY FLOAT, THEN--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND SPEAKING OF WITCHES,  FOLKS, HALLOWEEN IS RIGHT  AROUND THE CORNER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE OBAMA  ECONOMY MEANS A LOT OF  PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD  ELABORATE COSTUMES THIS  YEAR. IN FACT, MANY WOMEN CAN'T  EVEN AFFORD DIGNITY. (LAUGHTER)  SO TONIGHT I'VE GOT SOME  WAYS FOR YOU TO HAVE A GREAT  HALLOWEEN WITHOUT BUSTING  YOUR BUDGET. IT'S TIME FOR STEPHEN  GHOUL-BERT'S SPOOKY TIME  HALLOWEEN FUN GUIDE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW FIRST, FOLKS, FIRST, OF  COURSE, WILL YOU NEED A BIG  BOWL OF CANDY. AND A SEPARATE BIG BOWL OF  RAZOR BLADES, OKAY. THAT WAY THE KIDS CAN SEE  THAT THE RAZOR BLADES AREN'T  IN THE CANDY, ALL RIGHT. PUTS THE PARENTS' MINDS AT  EASE. NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT A  GREAT HALLOWEEN COSTUME DOES  NOT HAVE TO BE EXPENSIVE. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU JUST GRAB A  LITTLE FELT, OKAY, SOME  GLITTER, A TUBE OF GLUE AND  VOILA, NOW YOU ARE A KINTER GUARD-- KINDERGARTEN  TEACHER. OH, HEY HEY, THAT IS MY  SPECIAL GUEST WITH SOME MORE  GREAT IDEAS. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU LOOK GREAT.

OH, CLOUD ATLAS, YEAH,  YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS  THAT IS COMING OUT TOMORROW. BUT YOU KNOW, STEPHEN, I'M  NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT ME OR  MY MOVIES OR MY LEGACY AS A  LIVING LEGEND. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I DIDN'T  ACTUALLY SAY YOU WERE A  LIVING LEGEND.

Stephen: OH COME ON, TOM,  TOM, TOM. (APPLAUSE)  LOOK AT THAT.
I KNOW, I KNOW, ISN'T IT  GREAT. AND IT'S SO SIMPLE TO  MAKEMENT YOU PROBABLY HAVE A  VOLLEYBALL AT YOUR HOUSE, OR  JUST STEAL ONE FROM THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN JUST USE THE BLOOD  IN YOUR BODY, AND IT'S A  REAL PENNEY PINCHER.
Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK  YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: TOM, THAT'S  GREAT, BUT LISTEN, IF YOU  WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR  MOVIE CA REMEMBER --
NO, NO, NO STEPH EN,  STEVE BE, STEPHEN, MY CAREER  SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. AND IS AVAILABLE ON DVD AND  BLUE RAY. (APPLAUSE)  YOU KNOW T MAKES A GREAT  SUGAR-FREE ALTERNATIVE TO  HALLOWEEN CANDY WHICH IS SO  IMPORTANT, WHAT WITH AMERICA'S CHILDHOOD OBESITY  EPIDEMIC. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL  RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. COME ON. COME ON. YOU KNOW.
YOU KNOW, KIDS ARE SO  PERCEPTIVE.
Stephen: TOM, I'M  DISAPPOINTED IN YOU. THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT HELPING  PEOPLE. THIS IS A CYNICAL  MANIPULATION OF INNOCENT  CHILDREN TO PLUG YOUR  MOVIES.
STEPHEN, I CAN'T CONTROL  WHAT KIDS LIKE, WHAT WITH  THEIR SPONGEBOB AND POKEMON  AND CLOUD ATLAS. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
FINE, FINE, FINE, STEPHEN,  YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE  PRESSURE OF BEING TOM HANKS  WHEN YOU'RE UP ON THE TOP,  MAN. THEY'RE ALWAYS GUNNING FOR  YOU. THEY'RE ALWAYS GUNNING FOR  YOU. AND NOW I GOT THAT PUNK  JOSEPH GORDEN LEVITT NIPPING  AT MY HEELS. (APPLAUSE)  WELL, I HAVE MY OWN  RESPONSIBILITY, TOM HANKS,  STEPHEN GHOULBERT SPOOKY  TIME IS A SACRED TRUST AND YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, NOT EVEN  ONE COSTUME THAT IS JUST  ABOUT THE KIDS, AND NOT  ABOUT YOUR CAREER. WELL THEN, I'M AFRAID I'M  GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO  LEAVE.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,  EVERYBODY, PLEASE, PLEASE,  I'M SORRY. JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE  CHANCE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
