STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NEW ORLEANS JAZZ MUSICIAN. I'LL ASK HIM HOW LIFE IN THE SUPERDOME IS THESE DAYS. PLEASE WELCOME JON BATISTE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, MR. BATISTE FOR BEING HERE!
UH-HUH!
STEPHEN: ARE YOU HERE?
I'M HERE.
STEPHEN: ARE YOU ALIVE ON THE PLANET NOW?
I'M HANGING IN.
STEPHEN: YOUR WORK CROSSED WITH A LOT OF BOUNDARIES, YOU'RE FEATURED IN SPIKE LEE'S RED HOOK SUMMER AND THE H.B.O. SERIES TREME WAS BASED IN PART ON YOUR FAMILY.
YEAH.
STEPHEN: ARE YOU THE ONE WITH THE DRAGONS? IS THAT YOUR FAMILY?
NO, WE JUST GOT A FIELD OF COWS, YOU KNOW.
STEPHEN: A FIELD OF COWS, OKAY. THIS IS THE NEW ORLEANS ONE. THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF NUDITY IN THE TREME. IS THERE A FAIR AMOUNT OF NUDITY IN YOUR FAMILY?
WELL THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF NUDITY IN MY LIFE, YOU KNOW. (CHEERING)
STEPHEN: CONGRATULATIONS, MY FRIEND! LET'S TALK JAZZ A SECOND HERE.
OH, YEAH.
STEPHEN: YOU'RE GOING TO JAZZ AT US IN A LITTLE WHILE.
YEAH.
STEPHEN: DO I NEED A COLLEGE PROFESSOR TO EXPLAIN JAZZ WITH A CLOVE CIGARETTE AND A DIAGRAM? DO I NEED SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY I DO ENJOY A MODAL SCALE?
YOU CAN GO THAT ROUTE, YOU COULD DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE,  IT'S AMERICA. BUT I THINK THE BEST WAY IS TO JUST SIT BACK AND FEEL IT, MAN. IMPROVISATION IS FOREVER. EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS IMPROVISING. YOU MIGHT LIKE READING SCRIPTS, BUT -- (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER)
AYE!
STEPHEN: HOW ARE YA? HOW ARE YA?
DOING GOOD.
STEPHEN: GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE, MAN. GREAT TO HAVE YOU. EXPLAIN HOW YOUR MUSIC WORKS. YOU CALL IT SOCIAL MUSIC.
YEAH, IT'S SOCIAL BECAUSE IT'S MEANT TO BE SHARED. IT'S MEANT TO BE DANCED TO, YOU CAN CRY TO IT, LAUGH TO IT. THE THING ABOUT SOCIAL MUSIC IS THE WORLD IS GLOBAL NOW, EVERYTHING'S MORE CONNECTED WITH INTERNET AND ALL THIS STUFF, SOCIAL MEDIA. SO IF YOU TAKE MUSIC, I'M A JAZZ MUSICIAN AND THAT'S WHAT I WROTE THE MUSIC IN BUT I DRAW FROM ALL STYLES.
STEPHEN: JAZZ IS AN AMERICAN ART FORM.
YEAH.
STEPHEN: YOU SAY IT'S GLOBAL. DON'T GIVE AWAY OUR ART FORM TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT'S OUR ART FORM, BROTHER!
IT IS, BUT I GUESS IT'S OKAY TO BE CLOSED-MINDED.
STEPHEN: IT'S AMERICAN-MINDED, NOT CLOSED-MINDED. (AUDIENCE REACTS) IT'S NOT CLOSED MINDED! WE CANNOT BE OPEN-MINDED ANY MORE THAN WE CAN BE OPEN-BORDERED. (LAUGHTER) WE HAVE ALL THIS JAZZ AND IF WE LET THE ALIENS IN IT'S LIKE THE MUSIC HAS BEEN INVADED BY LITTLE GUATEMALANS! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
WE'RE NOT GIVING IT AWAY, WE'RE SHARING IT, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: SO THIS ISN'T JUST SOCIAL MUSIC, IT'S SOCIALISM.
NO, THE MUSIC IS REALLY ABOUT SHARING AN EXPERIENCE. YOU SHARE THE EXPERIENCE AS A GENUINE HUMAN EXCHANGE.
STEPHEN: NOW WE'RE HAVING A HUMAN MOMENT NOW.
YEAH, AND WE SHARE IT.
STEPHEN: I UNDERSTAND, BUT
BUT IT'S STILL MINE.
STEPHEN: BUT IS IT MINE, TOO?
IT CAN BE IF YOU WANT IT TO BE (AUDIENCE REACTS)
STEPHEN: WELL, WHAT'S MINE IS MINE. ♪♪ AND WHAT'S YOURS IS YOURS. ♪♪ AND TOGETHER WE'RE DOIN' THE SHOW. ♪♪ (CHEERING) WILL YOU STICK AROUND AND DO THAT AGAIN? (APPLAUSE)
YEAH, WE CAN DO IT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WOULD LIKE,.
STEPHEN:  BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH, JON BATISTE. STICK AROUND AND SHARE YOUR SOCIAL MUSIC WITH US AND HELP US STAY HUMAN
I LOVE IT
STEPHEN: THE ALBUM "SOCIAL MUSIC," WHICH IS  SOMEWHERE BACK THERE. JON BATISTE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. STICK AROUND.
