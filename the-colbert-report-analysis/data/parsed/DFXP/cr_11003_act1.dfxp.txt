( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, IT IS ALWAYS-- THANK YOU FOR THAT GREETING. YOU KNOW I NEED IT. I NEED YOUR ENERGY. THE HEROES-- THE HEROS ARE ALWAYS UP FOR MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. THANK YOU-- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US. THAT IS, IF YOU ARE STILL WITH US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I ASSUME EVERYONE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI HAS BEEN QUARANTINED IN THE EBOLA AFTERSCAPE. WE WILL HAVE FULL COVERAGE OF THAT CRISIS TOMORROW, IF THERE IS A TOMORROW. IN THE MEANTIME, NO ONE TOUCH ME. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT FIRST, NATION, AS A NEWSMAN, I ALWAYS KEEP TABS ON THE HEADLINES OUT OF CHINA. I CAN'T READ THEM, BUT I GET THE GIST-- LOOKS LIKE AN IKEA DRESSER WENT OFF A SKI JUMP. IT'S PROBABLY THE SPORTS SECTION. I DON'T KNOW. AND THE LATEST NEWS OUT OF HONG KONG HAS ME WORRIED ABOUT ITS RESIDENTS' SAFETY... IN BED... ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND EVERYWHERE ELSE.
MASSIVE PROTESTS FILLING THE STREETS OF HONG KONG.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE DEMONSTRATORS HAVE PACKED INTO THE HIGHWAYS AND STREETS, MOSTLY IN THE CITY'S CENTRAL FINANCIAL DISTRICT.
THEY CLASHED WITH POLICE WHO REPORTEDLY POINTED LONG- BARRELED GUNS AND USED TEAR GAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.
STEPHEN: YES, PROTESTORS IN HONG KONG ARE BEING ATTACKED WITH TEAR GAS. OR AS IT'S KNOWN IN CHINA, THE SKY. ( LAUGHTER ) THE PROTESTS HERE, IT'S ALL ABOUT DEMOCRACY YOU SEE, AFTER CHINA TOOK CONTROL OF HONG KONG FROM GREAT BRITAIN IN THE LATE 90S, THEY PROMISED "FREE ELECTIONS FOR HONG KONG'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN 2017. BUT NOW BEIJING SAYS "CANDIDATES MUST BE HAND PICKED BY A COMMITTEE OF PRO-GOVERNMENT TYCOONS." THAT IS NOT RIGHT. AMERICANS KNOW CANDIDATES MUST BE PICKED BY ANTIGOVERNMENT TYCOONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, GENTLEMEN. SO THOUSANDS OF HONG KONGOLESE HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS IN A COLLECTIVE ACTION THE "NEW YORK TIMES" CALLS, "A CHALLENGE TO XI JINPING'S RULE," THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DESCRIBES AS "AN UNPRECEDENTED SHOW OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE," AND THE OFFICIAL STATE PAPER "CHINA DAILY" DOWNPLAYED IN FAVOR OF THE BIGGER NEWS THAT 10,000 PIGEONS WERE GIVEN ANAL SECURITY CHECKS LEADING UP TO CELEBRATIONS FOR CHINA'S NATIONAL DAY. THAT'S RIGHT, 10,000  CHINESE PIGEONS WERE ANALLY PROBED. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, FOLKS, I-- I AM NO-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I AM NOT EXPERT ON THE CHINESE ZODIAC, BUT I KNOW WHOSE YEAR IT'S NOT. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, NATION, I STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG! THEY'RE GOING TO NEED ALL THE SUPPORT THEY CAN GET, TOO, BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME THE CHINESE PEOPLE STOOD UP TO OPPRESSION. AND IF YOU DO NOT REMEMBER, HEAD OVER TO THE BODIES EXHIBIT. BUT I HOPE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS LISTENING BECAUSE, GENTLEMEN, THE WORLD IS WATCHING, AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE HERE:   YOU CAN CRUSH THESE PROTESTORS UNDER YOUR HEEL, OR YOU CAN DO THE RIGHT THING AND GRANT THEM THE RIGHTS THEY WERE PROMISED. THINK CAREFULLY, BECAUSE WHICHEVER YOU CHOOSE, AMERICA WILL STILL DO BUSINESS WITH YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, HELL, WE'LL DO "TRANSFORMERS 5" JUST FOR YOU. THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY DIALOGUE IN THIS ONE! AND BUMBLEBEE HAS SOME HARSH WORDS FOR JAPAN'S FALSE CLAIMS TO THE SENKAKU ISLANDS. SO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, AS LONG AS YOUR FACTORIES KEEP PUMPING OUT THESE LITTLE BABIES OUT, OKAY. HERE WE GO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THE LEADERSHIP OF CHINA WANTS TO DO IS THE AUTHOR OF "THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF AMNESIA." PLEASE WELCOME, LOUISA LIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HERE'S THE BOOK, "THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF AMNESIA." NOW, LOUISA, WHAT IS HONG KONG? IS IT PART OF CHINA?
YES, IT IS PART OF CHINA. AND IT WAS A BRITISH COLONY, BUT IN 1997, IT WAS RETURNED TO CHINESE RULE UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT THAT WAS CALLED ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS. AND NOW WE'RE SEEING A VERY BIG STRAIN IN THAT ARRANGEMENT.
STEPHEN:  WHEN DEMOCRACY COMES TO ANOTHER COUNTRY, I USUALLY LIKE US TO BOMB IT INTO THEM. BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN? DO YOU THINK THE CHINESE ARE GOING TO ROLL THE TANKS IN ON THE HONG KONG-GEANS?
AT THIS POINT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO SAY. WE'RE SEEING VERY MIXED MESSAGES. THE RIOT POLICE WERE WITHDRAWN, BUT THERE WAS AN EDITORIAL IN THE "PEOPLE'S DAILY" TODAY, WHICH IS THE PARTY MOUTHPIECE, WHICH SAYS IF PEOPLE DO NOT WITHDRAW FROM THE STREETS, IT SAID THE ASSEMBLIES WERE WERE ILLEGAL AND IF PEOPLE DID NOT WITHDRAW THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE UNIMAGINABLE.
STEPHEN:  PERHAPS THEY WILL DO TO THE PROTESTERS WHAT THEY DID TO THE PIGEONS.
WHAT EVERYBODY HAS SAID IS A REWIND OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 1989. I MEAN, WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE POPULAR MOVEMENT IS THAT THIS IS ALMOST LIKE TIANANMEN 2.0.
STEPHEN:  IS ANY OF THIS INFORMATION GETTING ON TO THE MAINLAND OF CHINA?
IT IS BEING VERY, VERY HEAVILY CENSORED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE-- THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS VERY SCARED OF CONTAGION EFFECT. INSTAGRAM WAS BLOCKED IN CHINA
STEPHEN:  INSTAGRAM WAS BLOCKED.
THE PICTURES-- THE IMAGES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING ARE SUCH POTENT IMAGES AND THE CHINESE ARE WORRIED ABOUT CONTAGION EFFECT.
STEPHEN:  I THINK INSTAGRAM ALSO HAS A FILTER THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK LIKE IT WAS TAKEN IN TIANANMEN SQUARE IN 1989. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
CHINESE TWITTER HAS ALSO BEEN VERY HEAVILY CENSORED. ALL KINDS OF WORDS HAVE BEEN BANNED, WORDS LIKE "YELLOW RIBBONS" BECAUSE THE PROTESTERS ARE TYING YELLOW RIBBON AS A SYMBOL OF DEMOCRACY. AND EVEN WORDS LIKE "INSTAGRAM IS BLOCKED" IS BLOCKED.
STEPHEN:  THE WORDS "INSTAGRAM WAS BLOCKED" IS BLOCKED. ISN'T IT POSSIBLE IT WILL SWALLOW ITSELF? DO YOU THINK THIS COULD SPREAD TO OTHER AREAS THAT THE CHINESE CONTROL, LIKE THE U.S. TREASURY? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) GET BACK TO ME ON THAT ONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LOUISA LIM, "THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF AMNESIA." LOUISA LIM, "THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF AMNESIA." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
