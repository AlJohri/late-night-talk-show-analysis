Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST HELPED CREATE THE  TECHNOLOGY THAT BECAME THE INTERNET. SO HE'S HERE  TO PROMOTE...EVERYTHING? PLEASE WELCOME VINT CERF! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, VINT! WELL, LISTEN -- (LAUGHTER) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
I'M DELIGHTED.
Stephen: I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR WORK. YOU WERE CREDITED WITH BEING ONE OF THE CO-FATHERS OF THE INTERNET. WHAT DOES CO-FATHER MEAN AND HOW MUCH DID THE INTERNET'S MOTHER GET AROUND? (LAUGHTER) BACK IN THE DAY? WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE THE CO-FATHER OF THE INTERNET?
BOB CONN AND I, THE OTHER FATHER OF THE INTERNET, SAT DOWN IN 1973 AND BEGAN DESIGNING WHAT IS NOW THE INTERNET. THE ORIGINAL PROJECT WAS DONE TO HELP THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT USE COMPUTERS IN COMMAND AND CONTROL. A COMPUTER CAN HELP YOU MANAGE RESOURCES BETTER WHICH MIGHT MEAN THE SMALLER FORCE COULD OVERCOME A LARGER ONE IF THE SMALLER ONE COULD MANAGE ITS RESOURCES BETTER THAN THE OPPONENT.
Stephen: DID YOU BUILD THE SWITCH WHERE THE COMPUTER TURNS ON AND KILLS ALL OF HUMANITY? (LAUGHTER) THAT'S THE WAY THE MOVIE GOES. I'VE SEEN THE MOVIE.
THAT WASN'T THE PLAN.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MAKE AS ONE OF THE FATHERS OF THE INTERNET OF OUR FEAR THE COMPUTERS WILL TAKE OVER AND MAKE US OBSOLETE? DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANYTHING TO THAT IDEA?
NOT IN THAT FORM. WHAT I DO THINK, THOUGH, IS WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT COMPUTERS THAT MAKE MISTAKES BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKES FASTER THAN WE CAN AND SO THERE IS A BIG ISSUE ABOUT KEEPING THE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT SAFE WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WRITING SOFTWARE THAT DOESN'T HAVE BUGS.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE FATHERS OF THE INTERNET, WHY DID YOU MAKE SO IT DANGEROUS FOR US TO PLAY ON, VINT?
WELL, BECAUSE AT THE TIME, WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE AS POPULAR OR AS BIG AS IT WOULD BE. WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AN EXPERIMENT AND DESIGNED AND USE FOR MILITARY AND MAYBE ACADEMIC PURPOSES BUT IT GOT LOOSE AND THE EXPERIMENT GOT LOOSE AND BECAME PART OF THE PUBLIC.
Stephen: AGAIN, THAT'S PART OF THE HORROR MOVIE I'M WRITING. YOUR EXPERIMENT GOT LOOSE. WHEN I GO ON, ARE ALL OF US, ARE WE STILL PART OF YOUR EXPERIMENT?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: REALLY? HOW IS THE EXPERIMENT GOING?
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING RATHER WELL, TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU.  ABOUT 3 BILLION PEOPLE ARE ONLINE RIGHT NOW AND EVERY TIME THEY COME UP WITH NEW WAYS OF USING THE INTERNET, WE ALL LEARN SOMETHING FROM THAT. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS WHOLE STORY IS THE INTERNET HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY OPEN TO PEOPLE TRYING OUT NEW IDEAS AND WE NEED TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN AT GOOGLE SINCE 2005.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'RE THEIR INTERNET EVANGELIST. WHY DOES GOOGLE NEED AN INTERNET EVANGELIST? AREN'T YOU PREACHING TO THE CHOIR?
NO. ACTUALLY, IT TURNS OUT THAT WITH ONLY 3 BILLION PEOPLE ONLINE, THERE'S ANOTHER 4 BILLION TO GO. I'M THE CHIEF INTERNET EVANGELIST.
Stephen: WHO ARE THESE 4 BILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO TWEET?
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO TWEET, IT'S THAT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET YET.
Stephen: WHERE? ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT LARGELY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
Stephen: HAVE YOU TRIED CARPET BOMBING THEM WITH FREE AOL CDs? BECAUSE THAT WORKED IN THE '90s FOR A LONG TIME. (LAUGHTER)
THAT HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME. THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO READ THE CD WITH AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER, YOU KNOW -- THEY HAVE MOBILE PHONES, THOUGH, AND I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. THE MOBILE PHONE HAS BECOME THE AVENUE FOR PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO THE INTERNET FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT'S QUITE AN AMAZING MARRIAGE. THE INTERNET WAS FIRST DESIGNED IN '73. THE HANDHELD MOBILE WAS DESIGNED IN '73 BY MARTY COOPER FOR MOTOROLA AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER AT ALL TILL 1983 UNTIL WE TURNED THE INTERNET ON, MARTY COOPER TURNED ON THE FIRST HAND-HELD PHONE, SO THE TWO TECHNOLOGIES --
Stephen: YOU STARTED WORKING ON THE INTERNET IN 1973 AND YOU TURNED IT ON IN 1983?
IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO ACTUALLY TURN THE SYSTEM ON.
Stephen: WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THOSE TEN YEARS? IF YOU, BOB -- OBVIOUSLY, AL GORE WAS THERE -- (LAUGHTER)
AL SHOWED UP ABOUT 1986.
Stephen: THAT'S STILL PRETTY EARLY.
IT'S STILL EARLY ON. WE TURNED IT ON. HE HELPED GET IT TO SPREAD BECAUSE HE HELPED THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FUND THE BIG BACKBONE, PART OF THE INTERNET THAT LINKED ABOUT 3,000 UNIVERSITIES TOGETHER PLUS THE SUPERCOMPUTERS.
Stephen: SO HE DID HELP BUILD THE INTERNET?
HE DID HELP.
Stephen: YOU JUST TOOK AWAY ONE OF MY FAVORITE CUDGELS. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A SECOND? WE HAVE TO DO A COMMERCIAL BUT I WANT TO TALK MORE. WE'LL BE BACK WITH FATHER OF THE INTERNET VINT CERF. STICK AROUND.
