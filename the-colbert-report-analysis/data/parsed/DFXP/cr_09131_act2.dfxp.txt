[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. VERY NICE. WELCOME BACK. NATION, I LOVE HUMILITY. AND I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT I AM  AS HUMBLE OR MORE HUMBLE THAN  ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE. YOU THINK YOU'RE HUMBLER THAN  ME? [BLEEP] YOU. I'M THE KING OF HUMILITY. SO I AM A HUGE FAN OF FIRST-TERM  TEXAS SENATOR AND GUY WITH JOSH  GROBAN ON HIS WORKOUT MIX TED  CRUZ. SENATOR CRUZ'S VERY PUBLIC  OUTSPOKENNESS HAS MADE HIM A  THORN IN THE SIDE OF THE G.O.P. LEADERSHIP BUT THEY HAVEN'T TOLD  THE PRESS ABOUT THEIR  DISPLEASURE BECAUSE WHENEVER THEY GET NEAR A CAMERA, TED CRUZ  IS ALREADY IN FRONT OF IT. RECENTLY CRUZ SAT DOWN WITH  ABC'S JONATHAN CARL TO EXPLAIN  WHAT KEEPS HIM SO DARNED MODEST.
YOU ARGUED A CASE BEFORE THE  SUPREME COURT AT AGE 32.
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY  OPPORTUNITY TO STAND BEFORE THE  U.S. SUPREME COURT. TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY. WE DIDN'T HAVE A PRAYER. WE WERE NOT GOING TO WIN THAT  CASE. I STOOD UP AND FOR 30 MINUTES  THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE FRIENDLY  QUESTION. I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE THE FACT THAT  I SIT IN MY OFFICE AND I LOOK AT  A GIANT PAINTING OF ME GETTING MY TAIL WHIPPED 9-0. IT IS VERY GOOD FOR INSTILLING  HUMILITY.
Stephen: YES, I HAVE TO TELL  YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF  THIS PAINTING COMES OFF AS MORE  HUMBLE. IS IT THE HYPOTHETICAL OF HALO  SURROUNDING HIS HEAD OR IS IT  HIS LOOK TOWARD HEAVEN? OR IS IT ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN  THIS PAINTING OF HIM WOULD ARE  PAINTING MORE PAINTINGS OF HIM? IN FACT...   ( APPLAUSE )   IN FACT, TED CRUZ IS SO HUMBLE  HE DOESN'T EVEN MENTION WHAT  NOBLE CAUSE HE CHAMPIONED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT THAT DAY. THIS MODEST HERO ARGUED THAT  TEXAS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BACK  OUT OF A LEGAL SETTLEMENT IN WHICH IT HAD VOWED TO IMPROVE  HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR POOR  CHILDREN. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO WONDER HE LOOKS SO  CHRIST-HIKE IN THAT PAINTING. WE ALL REMEMBER THE STORY OF  JESUS PROMISING TO MULTIPLY  LOAFS AND FISHES FOR THE POOR. THEN BACKING OUT OF IT ON LEGAL  GROUNDS. I MEAN ALL THAT RAW FISH SITTING  OUT IN THE DESERT SUN? I MEAN, SASHIMI IN ISRAEL? COME ON, THAT'S JUST A FOOD  POISONING LAWSUIT WAITING TO  HAPPEN. FOLKS, IT'S NO WONDER I LIKE TED  CRUZ SO MUCH BECAUSE I TOO LIKE  TO KEEP MY EGO IN CHECK BY HAVING PORTRAITS DONE OF MYSELF. FOR INSTANCE, THIS WALL-SIZED  MURAL OF ME WINNING JUST ONE OF  THE EMMYS I WAS NOMINATED FOR IN  2010. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? IT COULD BE 2008. I'VE WON A COUPLE OF TIMES. ANYWAY, IT JUST KEEPS ME HUMBLE. OR THE TIME I WAS CUTTING DOWN A  TREE LIMB THAT WAS HANGING OVER  THE DRIVEWAY. IT FELL ON ME WHICH WAS PRETTY  EMBARRASSING SO I HAD IT  COMMEMORATED ON CANVAS IN A PIECE ENTITLED "THE PASSION OF  THE STEPHEN."  A LITTLE NOTE TO ANY FREEHS  WATCHING. THIS ACT OF HUMILITY IS ALSO  AVAILABLE IN STAINED GLASS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
