[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY GUEST TONIGHT SAYS  BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH SYMPHONY IS  SHORTHAND FOR ALL CLASSICAL  MUSIC. GREAT, NOW I DON'T HAVE TO  LISTEN TO THE REST OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ] PLEASE WELCOME MATTHEW  GUERRIERI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?
GUERRIERI.
Stephen: GREAT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WARRIORS.
Stephen: YOU ARE MANY  WARRIOR?
EXTREMELY ILL-NAMED IS WHAT I  AM.
Stephen: LISTEN HERE, TOUGH  GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED  "THE FIRST FOUR NOTES:  BAY TOAF  YEN'S FIFTH AND THE HUMAN IMAGINATION."  YOU ARE A MUSIC CRITIC FOR "THE  BOSTON GLOBE", YOU ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BLOG  SOHOTHEDOING. WHY THIS SECTION OF THIS  SYMPHONY? WHY THE FIRST FOUR NOTES?
WELL, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE  INTERESTED IN CULTURE AND  MUSICAL CULTURE THIS PIECE IS THE BEGINNING OF THE MUSICAL  CULTURE WE KNOW TODAY.
Stephen: DON DON, DON, DON  DAH.
IT HAS AN OPENING EVERYBODY  CAN REMEMBER.
Stephen:. ♪ ♪
IT KEEPS GOING.
Stephen: IT'S KIND OF  REPETITIVE. INCREDIBLE CELL PHONE JINGLE  WRITER OF ALL TIMES? [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HEAR IT THAT MUCH.
Stephen: REALLY?
I WISH I HEARD IT MORE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO HANG  OUT WITH CLASSIER PEOPLE.
I DO.
Stephen: IS IT  REVOLUTIONARY? WHAT IS SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THE  FACT THAT HE KEEPS DRIVING HOME  THIS ONE THING THROUGHOUT THE THEME OF THE ENTIRE SYMPHONY?
IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING AT  THE TIME AND IT WAS SORT OF A  HOOK THAT LET A GROUP OF THINKERS CALLED THE GERMAN  ROMANTICS ADOPT THIS PIECE AS  THEIR MUSICAL MASCOT. THEY WERE TRYING TO REALLY  RETHINK THE WAY THAT PEOPLE  PERCEIVED MUSIC. THEY WERE TRYING TO REORGANIZE  THE HIERARCHY OF MUSICAL LIFE. BEETHOVEN HAPPENED TO BET BEST  COMPOSER AROUND. THEY WANTED TO USE HIS MUSIC AS  AN EXAMPLE TO ADVANCE THEIR IND  INTELLECTUAL CAUSE AND THIS PIECE TURNED OUT TO FIT THEIR  AGENDA PERFECTLY. IT'S THIS ABILITY TO TRACE THE  MOTIVE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE  PIECE ACTUALLY TIES INTO A LOT OF IT WILLARY IDEAS THEY ARE  INTERESTED IN. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IDEAS OF  ACHIEVING SOME SORT OF  WHOLENESS, ACHIEVING ORGANIC UNIT AFTER GOING THROUGH A  JOURNEY OF MEETING UP WITH  DOUBLES AND MEETING UP WITH SORT OF -- SORT OF THESE UNCANNY  COINCIDENCES. AND THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR  THIS WAS AN AUTHOR NAMED ETI  HOFFMAN WHO WROTE A LONG AND FAMOUS REVIEW OF THE PIECE. LATER ON HE WOULD GO ON TO WRITE  FICTION THAT WAS FAMOUS AT THE  TIME. ALL OF THINKS FICTION IS ALL  ABOUT THESE PEOPLE WHO MEET  OTHER PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY ARE LONG LOST TWINS, OR THEY MEET --  IN SOME OF THE STORIES THE  CHARACTERS MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOCKWORK REP CAZ OF OTHER  PEOPLE. IT'S THIS WEIRD SORT OF IDEA  THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS  HALL OF MIRRORS AND AT THE END OF IT, YOU COME OUT REALIZING  THAT THERE'S THIS WHOLENESS YOU  DON'T QUITE HAVE ACCESS TO BUT THE ROMANTICS BELIEVE MUSIC GAVE  YOU A GLIMPSE OF THAT. THESE ARE INCREDIBLY HEADY IDEAS  BUT BEETHOVEN WAS THE DELIVERY  VEHICLE FOR IT.
Stephen: NOW, I DID NOT  FOLLOW ALL OF THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THESE GERMANS HAD SOME BIG  IDEAS.
VERY BIG.
Stephen: AND BETOAFEN'S  MUSIC SEEMED LIKE A  MANIFESTATION OF THESE IDEAS. WHY THESE FOUR NOTES THE  MANIFESTATION OF THAT? YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH IT  AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I'LL BE JUST AS LOST.
TO BE HONEST, THEY WERE, TOO,  SO.
Stephen: TO THEY HAD A  ROMANTIC LONGING FOR SOME SORT  OF IDEAL AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE IDEAL THE REPRESENT  TITION OF THIS THEME SO -- WHAT  DID I JUST SAY MEAN?
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT WHAT THAT SORT OF THING  MEANT? THEY WERE YEARNING FOR SOMETHING  REALLY BEYOND HUMAN  UNDERSTANDING.
Stephen: I THINK BEYOND  HUMAN UNDERSTANDING, WERE THEY  POPULAR? WAS THIS A HIT?
THE FIRST PER FORMANCE WAS A  DISASTER BUT ONCE HOFFMAN'S  REVIEW CAME OUT PEOPLE BEGAN TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND IT DID  BECOME FAIRLY WELL KNOWN. IT'S REALLY ONE OF FIRST PIECES  OF MUSIC WHERE PEOPLE FELT LIKE  THEY HAD TO KNOW IT TO BE CULTURALLY LITERATE.
Stephen: DID THEY HAVE  GOOFY?
THE GERMAN ROMANTICS GLOMMED  ON TO HIM.
Stephen: I MEANT THE LADIES  UNLESS, YOU KNOW TORQUE EACH HIS  OWN.
YOU HAD UNFULFILL ADD  TACHMENTS WITH PURPOSELY  UNATTAINABLE WOMEN THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. THERE WAS A PAIR OF  PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO WROTE A BOOK  THAT SUGGESTED MAYBE HE WASN'T THAT INTERESTED IN THE LADIES.
Stephen: ISN'T FUR ELISE  FOR A LADY LOVE?
NOBODY IS QUITE SURE.
Stephen: IT WAS WRITTEN FOR  ELISE. MATTHEW THANK YOU FOR COMING ON  WITH ME.
