TONIGHT, HOW CAN AMERICANS PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY?  MY SOLUTION?  A DIARY WITH A LITTLE HEART-SHAPED LOCK. THEN A NEVADA POLITICIAN GETS IN TROUBLE, WHICH IS SHOCKING BECAUSE NOTHING IS ILLEGAL IN NEVADA. AND MY GUEST, COFOUNDER, WHO TEACHES COMPUTER CODING SKILLS FOR FREE. KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, YOU WILL WANT TO STAY TUNED. HAPPY THANKSGIVING!  APRIL FOOLS'. HAPPY HALLOWEEN!  THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT!  WHOO!  WHOO!  HAPPY HALLOWEEN!  THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT!  WHOO!  WHOO!  WHOO! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO THE COL-SCARE REPORT. JOINING US "TONIGHT-MARE". GOOD EVENING EVERY-BONE.
THANK SIGN.
FRANKENSTEIN. FOLKS AS YOU CAN TELL I LOVED HALLOWS EVE, IT IS ONLY TIME OF YEAR WHEN CHILDREN BRING BUCKETS OF CANDY RIGHT TO YOUR HOUSE. THEY RING THE BELL, THEN HOLD UP THEIR BUCKETS FOR YOU TO HELP YOURSELVES, AND THEN LATER THAT NIGHT THEY BRING YOU FREE EGGS AND TOILET PAPER.
ONLY AMERICA.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HALLOWEEN THERE ARE SOME REAL GRINCHES OUT THERE, SOMETIMES AFTER A NIGHT OF TRICK OR TREATING YOU GET AN APPLE WITH A RAISER BLADE IN IT, SHATTER FILING, I COULD CUT MYSELF MAKING A BONG OUT OF IT. THIS IS THE WAR ON HALLOWEEN.
FACING A LOT OF TV FOLK ARE IN THE HALLOWEEN SPIRIT TODAY. JUST THIS MORNING, I SAW KELLEY RIPA DRESSED AS MILEY CYRUS. AND GEORGE STEPHANOPOULUS WENT AS A TINY ASTRONAUT WHICH I BELIEVE MAKES HIM AMERICA'S ENTIRE SPACE PROGRAM. I, OF COURSE, AM DRESSED AS A SEXY HOBO WHO GOT A WORK ETHIC, PULLED HIMSELF UP BY HIS OWN BOOT STRAPS AND THEN GOT A TASTY MAKEOVER. BUT, FOLKS, ON TODAY'S, THE TODAY SHOW TODAY, HALLOWEEN DIED. WHEN ANCHOR MATT LAUER DRESSED UP AS MY WAKING NIGHTMARE. I LOOK FAR WARD TO THE NEW SEGMENT, WHERE IN THE HECK IS MATT LAUER'S DIGNITY?  SPOOK CAN I STUFF. SPOOKY STUFF.
FOLKS SPEAKING OF SPOOKY, EVERY DAY AMERICA WAKES UP TO A NEW REVELATION ABOUT NSA SPYING, JUST HOW DEEP DOES IT GO AND WHY DOES THAT CLOCK ON MY BED KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TIME I NEED TO WAKE UP?
STILL, FOLKS, THE MORE I LEARN, THE SAFER I FEEL. NSA IS PROTECTING AMERICA AND THEIR GLOBAL SPY NETWORK MAKES US INVINCIBLE TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT A 29-YEAR-OLD DUDE WITH A THUMB DRIVE.
BUT WITH SOME LEAKS IN MY OWN HOUSE AND I HOPE THE GOVERNMENT HANDLES THE LEAKS THE SAME WAY BY HIRING A CONTRACTOR TO WHACK IT A FEW TIMES WITH A MONKEY WRENCH. BECAUSE TODAY BROUGHT ANOTHER THE EXPLOSIVE REVELATION.
THERE IS ANOTHER NEW REPORT ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY TODAY. AND ITALIAN MAGAZINE CALLED PANORAMA REPORTS THE NSA MAY HAVE SPIED ON THE POPE. AND SOME CARDINALS. SOURCES AT THE MAGAZINE HAVE BEEN TOLD THE NSA EAVESDROPPED ON VATICAN PHONE CALLS BEFORE THE CONCLAVE, THAT TOP SECRET MEETING OF CARDINALS.
#01: FOLKS. I AM A DEVOUT CATHOLIC BUT I BELIEVE THE NSA MUST SPY ON THE VATICAN, THEY ARE TAPPING THE DIRECT LINE TO GOD. AND AS I HAVE POINTED OUT, THIS GUY HAS GOT A BEARD, SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND I KEEP HEARING HE HAS GOT SOME "PLAN" THAT FOR SOME REASON ALWAYS INVOLVES YOUR GRANDPA DYING. BUT SADLY, SADLY, THERE ARE MISGUIDED CRITICS OUT THERE WHO VALUE SOMETHING MORE THAN TOTAL OPERATIONAL AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. LET'S GO DOWN.
UTTERLY OUT OF CONTROL.
THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY AND SECURITY.
THE UNITED STATES HAS SIMPLY GOT THE BALANCE WRONG. TOO MUCH INVASION OF PRIVACY IN THE PURSUIT OF SECURITY.
#01:.
COME ON WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT A GOVERNMENT INVASION OF PRIVACY, AT THIS POINT WE HAVE INVADED EVERYWHERE ELSE. THANKFULLY, THERE IS A WAY TO KEEP THE NSA SPYING PROGRAM ALIVE WHILE STILL MAINTAINING AMERICA'S SENSE OF PRIVACY AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. THE.
Colbert: SEE NO EVIL, THIS WEEK THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HELD HEARINGS ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM, I HOPE AL QAEDA DOESN'T WATCH C-SPAN.
NOW, ONE WITNESS, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR STEPHEN LAD DACK CLAIMS THE NSA PROGRAM VIOLATED THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, NOW, LUCKILY, MICHIGAN REPRESENTATIVE AND MEATLOAF STUNT DOUBLE MIKE ROGERS COUNTERED WITH THE LATEST IN JUSTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY.
I WOULD ARGUE THAT MAYBE THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY COMPLAINTS COME FORWARD WITH ANY SPECIFICITY, ARGUING THAT THEIR PRIVACY HAS BEEN VIOLATED CLEARLY INDICATES IN TEN YEARS, CLEARLY INDICATES THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DOING RIGHT, SOMEBODY MUST BE DOING SOMETHING EXACTLY RIGHT.
Colbert: YEAH, FOR TEN YEARS NO ONE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE THING THEY DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED. NOW, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, THAT IS SOUND LOGIC TO ME. WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER FOR THAT, PROFESSOR?
BUT WHO WOULD BE COMPLAINING?
SOMEBODY WHOSE PRIVACY WAS VIOLATED. YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR PRIVACY VIOLATED IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR PRIVACY IS VIOLATED, RIGHT?
Colbert: RIGHT. IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR PRIVACY WAS VIOLATED THEN IT WASN'T. IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. FOLKS, IT IS JUST LIKE, IT IS JUST LIKE WHEN SOMEONE LIES TO YOU, TECHNICALLY THEY ARE TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AS LONG AS YOU NEVER FIND OUT IT WAS A LIE. REALLY, IN THE END, IT IS REALLY AN ISSUE OF TRUST. FOR EXAMPLE, I TRUST THAT MY CHILDHOOD DOG SKIP IS HAVING FUN CHASING RABBITS AT THAT FARM UPSTATE. THAT REMIND ME, HAPPY 41ST BIRTHDAY, SKIPPER, I HOPE YOU GOT THAT BONE I SENT YOU. NOW, CONGRESSMAN ROGERS, I BELIEVE GETS IT. PRIVACY IS NOT SOME PHYSICAL THING THAT YOU CAN HAVE OR NOT HAVE VIOLATED. IT IS A STATE OF MIND LIKE ZEN. PROFESSOR VLADEK, HE, CERTAINLY EVEN YOU AGREE WITH THAT.
I DISAGREE WITH THAT. I THINK IF THE TREE FALLS IN THE FOREST AND MAKES A NOISE WHETHER YOU ARE THERE OR NOT.
Colbert: YES, IT MAKES A NOISE AT THE, THAT THE NSA WAS LISTENING TO. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TREE NEVER FIND OUT. OR, RATHER, RATHER, LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER TREE ANALOGY. LET'S SAY INSTEAD OF FALLING IN THE FOREST THE TREE IS STANDING OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE AND I AM HIDING IN IT WATCHING YOU SHOWER. NOW, SO FAR, SO FAR, I AM NOT VIOLATING YOUR PRIVACY, BUT THE SECOND YOU SEE ME THROUGH THE WINDOW, SUDDENLY I AM THE CRIMINAL?  WHAT ABOUT MY PRIVACY ANY AM TRYING THOMAS BAIT HERE.
I AM TRYING TO MASTURBATE HERE.
NOW, COME TO THINK OF IT ..
NOW, THERE ARE REALLY ALL SORTS OF VICTIMLESS CRIMES LIKE THIS. WE KNOW PEOPLE GET ASSAULTED BECAUSE THEY CALL THE POLICE, BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE CALLING THE COMES BECAUSE THEY WERE MURDERED. THEREFORE, CLEARLY, NO ONE WAS KILLED. NOW, BY THE SAME LOGIC, BY THE SAME LOGIC, FOLKS, I HAVE NOT INSULTED MIKE ROGERS AS LONG AS HE NEVER HEARS ME SAY THE REASON MIKE ROGERS USES CIRCULAR LOGIC IS BECAUSE HIS HEAD IS JAMMED UP HIS OWN ASS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY I DO NOT MEAN A WORD OF THAT, I ADMIRE WHAT HISTORIANS WILL NOW CALL THE ROGERS DOCTRINE. WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY VERSUS SECURITY, WE CAN HAVE ONE OF THEM AS LONG AS WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS. THAT WAY, WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OR IF THEY DO TAKE AWAY OUR RIGHTS JUST DON'T LET US FIND OUT. THAT WAY, WE WILL STILL HAVE THEM. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
