Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT'S "REPORT." BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT'S IT FOR THE 2014 MIDTERMS, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THAT'S IT FOR MY YEARS OF LIVE ELECTION COVERAGE. SO, I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT BEFORE WE GO TO SAY THANK YOU. AND ALSO THANK ME. (LAUGHTER) COUNTING MY TIME ON THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON DAILY AND THE DAILY ZOO CREW, WE'VE BEEN GETTING TOGETHER WITH YOU LIKE THIS SINCE 2000. WHO CAN FORGET THAT ONE? BUSH V CHAD. IF YOU'RE COUNTING, THAT'S 8 LIVE ELECTION SHOWS IN 14 YEARS. MAKES SENSE SINCE 14 DIVIDED BY 2 IS 8. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE SO MANY MEMORIES. MOSTLY SHAPES AND COLORS. THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF DRINKING ALONG THE WAY. (LAUGHTER) AS I LEAVE YOU FOR THE LAST TIME, I'D LIKE TO SHARE WHAT I'VE LEARNED WITH FUTURE GENERATIONS AS WELL AS THE ALIENS FROM ZAFRAX-5 WHO FIND THIS SHOW ON THE GOLDEN CYLINDERS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE MOMENTS BEFORE THE EARTH EXPLODES. HI GUYS! PLEASE REMEMBER THAT WHOEVER WON THIS ELECTION, THE REPUBLICANS, SOMEONE IS ALWAYS RUNNING AGAINST SOMEONE SOMEWHERE  ELSE OR OTHER. ONE OF THEM WINS, THE OTHER LOSES. SOME ARE TOO CLOSE TO CALL. YOU MEAN TO CHECK BACK LATER  AND FIND OUT WHO WON. BUT YOU FORGET AND BY THE TIME YOU  THINK TO DO IT, THERE'S ALREADY ANOTHER ELECTION. I'M SURE THEY WRITE DOWN WHO THE GOVERNOR OF NORTH DAKOTA IS SOMEWHERE. I COULDN'T FIND IT. BUT MOST OF US AREN'T GOING TO NEED THAT INFORMATION. WE GO ABOUT OUR LIVES SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT NORTH DAKOTA HAS A GOVERNOR OR EQUIVALENT. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER? THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN OF BROADCAST NEWS WHO TOLD US WHO WON THAT GOVERNOR'S RACE. MEN AND WOMEN LIKE -- STEPHEN COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU SEE, FOLKS, TONIGHT MARKS A SORT OF FAREWELL FOR ME. MAYBE SOME DAY YOU WILL SEE ME ON TV AGAIN AND YOU WILL NUDGE YOUR SPOUSE AND SAY, HEY, I REMEMBER THAT GUY. I USED TO LOVE HIM. MAYBE I WILL BUY HIS SLAP CHOP. SO THAT'S IT FOR "THE REPORT." I'LL END BY SAYING IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEEN WELCOMED INTO YOUR HOME THESE LAST NINE YEARS. SO TO YOU AND YOURS, I'LL SAY A FOND -- WHAT'S THAT? ANOTHER MONTH AND A HALF OF SHOWS? (LAUGHTER) WELL, THEN, THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO DRAMATIC. (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW! I'M EMBARRASSED! WOW!
