Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, THANKS, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I'M A HUGE FAN OF FOX NEWS ANCHOR SEAN HANNITY. SEAN IS SUCH A GOOD JOURNALIST HE CAN BREAK DOWN THE NEWS INTO SIMPLE TERMS THAT EVEN HE CAN UNDERSTAND. AND RECENTLY MY MAIN MANITY HANNITY INTRODUCED A NEW SEGMENT ON HIS SHOW CALLED QUESTION OF THE DAY, WHERE HE ANSWERS THE MOST PRESSING QUESTIONS OF OUR TIME.
TIME NOW FOR THE QUESTION OF THE DAY, NEW SEGMENT ON HANNITY. NOW YOU GET TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ME AND I GET TO KNOW MORE BUT, OUR LOYAL VIEWERS SO TONIGHT'S QUESTION IS WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE BAND, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST CAR.
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW TO BINGE WATCH.
THANK YOU, I WILL NEED YOUR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME AND THE NAME OF YOUR FIRST PET AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND WE WILL SET UP A CREDIT CARD FOR MY GOOD FRIEND, THE NIGERIAN PRINCE.
BUT HANNITY SAVED THE BEST FOR THE MOST RECENT. BECAUSE LAST NIGHT HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT WAS ON ALL OF HIS MIND.
TIME FOR A QUESTION OF THE DAY, TONIGHT'S QUESTION IS SOMETHING I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE WAY TO WORK OUT. NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE DELICATELY JOGS ON HIS ELLIPTICAL AND STRUGGLES TO LIFT A COUPLE OF TWO POUND WEIGHTS. I'VE BEEN ENGAGING IN A REAL EXERCISE.
Stephen: YEAH, PRESIDENT OBAMA DELICATELYING JOGS WHILE HANNITY FORCEFULLY RAMS PRESIDENT OBAMA INTO THIS SEGMENT FOR NO REASON. SO--  (APPLAUSE) NOT EVEN ANY LUBRICANT. SO SO WHAT IS YOUR EXERCISE SECRET, SEAN?
FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS I'VE LOST 27 POUNDS BY SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS EACH WEEK DOING THIS, IT'S WHAT MY INSTRUCTOR CALLS STREET MARTIAL ARTS WHICH IS REALLY A MIXED MARTIAL ARTS PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES KICK BOXING, JIUJITSU, FILIPINO MARTIAL ARTS AND BLADE AND FIREARM TRAINING.
Stephen: WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO BLADE TRAINING. I MEAN HANDLING KNIVES IS AMAZING EXERCISE. THAT'S WHY MARIO BATALI IS IN SUCH GREAT SHAPE. AND FOLKS, (APPLAUSE) TALK ABOUT GETTING RIPPED. FIREARM TRAINING?
I'LL BET SEAN HAS SIX-PACK FINGER ABS. FOLKS, SEEING SEAN TAKE TIME OUT FROM COVERING EBOLA AND ISIS TO LET US KNOW HIS BOD IS ROCK HARD, HAS INSPIRED ME TO INTRODUCE MY OWN SEGMENT WHERE I ASK MYSELF FLATTERING QUESTIONS ABOUT MYSELF. IT'S TIME FOR STEPHEN COLBERT'S EVERYTHING I WANTED YOU TO WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ME BUT I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T ASK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION,. (AUDIENCE CHANTS "STEPHEN!") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT QUESTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM THAT I SUBMITTED LIKE HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT OR HOW DO YOU GET YOUR SKIN TO GROW LIKE A PREGNANT WOMAN'S, AND WOW, STEPHEN, YOU ARE SO GREAT IT'S AMAZING. BUT THE ONE I HAVE DECIDED TO ASK AN ANSWER TONIGHT IS, I'VE NOTICED YOU'RE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN SEAN HANNITY. HOW DO YOU WORK OUT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, THANKS FOR ASKING ME, ME SEAN HANNITY DELICATELY SHOOTS HIS JIUJITSU GUNS AND CAN BARELY LIFT A TWO POUND SCIMITAR. I WORK OUT LIKE A REAL MAN. EVERY MORNING I GET UP, MAKE A PROTEIN SHAKE AND THROW IT IN THE FACE OF A JAGUAR, THEN I CRAB WALK FOR 25 MILES AND STAB A MOUNTAIN IN THE HEART. THEN I FINISH UP WITH A LITTLE SELF-FLAGELLATION AND A CATAPULT WORK. I'M TELLING YOU, CRANKING THE RACK REALLY BLASTS MY CORE. AND THE PAST 18 MONTHS I'VE LOST OVER 30 POUNDS. NOW MOST OF THAT IS BLOOD WEIGHT THANKS TO THE JAGUAR. OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE--  (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE THERE IS ONE AREA OF PHYSICAL FITNESS WHERE I WILL NEVER MATCH SEAN. FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE LISTENING TO HIM ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HIMSELF ON HIS OWN SHOW, I KNOW I CAN NEVER WATCH HIS ABILITY TO GET HIS HEAD UP HIS OWN ASS. I MEAN LITERALLY, LITERALLY. I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE OF SEAN'S ANSWERS TO BURNING QUESTIONS LIKE HOW IS THIS NEWS. AND WHAT ELSE IS ON TV. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
