[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, WELCOME BACK TO THE COLBERT BOOK CLUB ALREADY IN PROGRESS. LONG TIME VIEWERS OF TO THE'S SHOW KNOW WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT NOBEL PRIZE WINNER AND MY PERSONAL HERO RUGGED MAN'S MAN ERNEST HEMINGWAY. WE'RE DISCUSSING HIS WORLD WAR I CLASSIC "FAREWELL TO ARMS." I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I READ THE BOOK. IT'S LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. IT WAS YESTERDAY. I READ IT FROM THE FRONT COVER TO THE BACK COVER. I TELL YOU WHAT I NEVER SAW COMING, $27 U.S. $30 CANADIAN. EVIDENTLY IT'S A SLIGHTLY BETTER BOOK IN CANADA. MY GUEST TONIGHT TO DISCUSS THE "FAREWELL TO ARMS" IS THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR, MICHAEL CHABON. (DOORBELL).
Stephen: THERE HE IS NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MICHAEL CHABON. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: YOU'RE THE BEST SELLING AUTHOR PULITZER PRIZE WINNER. A NEW BOOK "TELEGRAPH AVENUE."
YES. Stephen: NEITHER BY ERNEST HEMINGWAY. YOU'RE A ENORMOUS FAN OF HEMINGWAY, TRUE.
YES, LIFE LONG. Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S A GREAT AMERICAN MASTER? WHY ARE KIDS FORCED TO READ THIS IN SCHOOL?
WELL, I THINK OF ALL OF THE BOOKS YOU MAY GET FORCED TO READ IN SCHOOL THIS IS ONE THAT IS LEAST PAINFUL. I THINK THE THING ABOUT HEMINGWAY THAT STAYS WITH ME. IT HAS STAYED WITH ALL OF US OVER THE YEARS IS THE WRITING ITSELF. THE HEMINGWAY STYLE. YOU TALK ABOUT THE SPARE, SPARING USE OF ADJECTIVES.
Stephen: IF HE WAS PAID BY THE WORD HE WOULD OF STARVED TO DEATH.
THAT'S THE THING HE LEARNED HOW TO DO IT BY WORKING AS A JOURNALIST. HIS INNOVATION. IF YOU PICK UP A BOOK OF EARLY HEMINGWAY, FROM THE 20S. IT'S FREE FRESH, MAY OF BEEN WRITTEN YESTERDAY. THE WRITING IS SO LEAN. WHERE AS YOU PICK UP SOMETHING, I LOVE FITZGERALD. BUT THE GREAT GATSBY HAS A VICTORIAN, DATED QUALITY. HEMINGWAY IS UTTERLY FRESH AND MODERN. I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE HE INVENTED THE MODERN WAY OF WRITING. HE INVENTED THE AMERICAN NARRATIVE VOICE. HIS SHAD OH HE CASTS A LONG SHADOW THROUGH THE 20th CENTURY.
Stephen: FOR SUCH A MANLY MAN. THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SEX IN THIS. WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE. IT'S FREDERICK HENRY AND THEN KATHRYN. WHAT'S HER LAST NAME.
I FORGET. SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW --
Stephen: IF YOU REMEMBERED, I HAD REMEMBERED IT WOULD SEEM LIKE ONE OF US HADN'T READ THE BOOK.
ARE YOU GOING TO HOLD ME -- Stephen: CATHRYN.
YES FREDERICK AND CATHRYN. Stephen: YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW CATHRYN GETS PREGNANT. "50 SHADES OF GREY" SOLD A TON. WHY NOT MORE LIGHTS ON, WILD STYLE? FOR A MANLY MAN WHY NOT SEXY TIME.
WELL, SPEAKING AS A MANLY MAN. I THINK, YOU KNOW THE TIME HE WAS WRITING -- [LAUGHING]
THE TIME HE WAS WRITING IT WAS JUST, HE DID PUSH BOUNDARIES FOR WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE IN A WORK OF FICTION IN TERMS OF TABOOS. THEY WERE FAIRLY STRONG. HE HAD TO EDIT OUT A LOT OF LANGUAGE. I THINK HE USED MORE FOUR LETTER WORDS IN THE ORIGINAL DRAFT. A LOT OF THAT WAS TAKEN OUT.
Stephen: WHY, WHY IF YOU WANT TO WRITE SOMETHING SO EMOTIONALLY SPARE WHY DO A NOVEL. WHY NOT MANUALS FOR IKEA FURNITURE. PUT PEG B IN SLOT A. WHICH IS PROBABLY SEXIER THAN -- [LAUGHING]
Stephen: -- HE WROTE IN HERE. WHY DO YOU THINK? WHY DO YOU THINK HE WENT FROM JOURNALISM TO NOVELS. JOURNALISM IS DRY. DON'T WE WANT GOOEY GUSHY IN THE NOVEL?
TO THE EXTENT OF THE GUSHY STUFF IT'S THE DETRIMENT TO THE BOOK. WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK SO MAGNIFICENT TO ME ARE THE WAR PASSAGES. YOU MENTIONED IN THE INTRODUCTION HEMINGWAY EXPERIENCED SEVERE TRAUMA IN WAR. ALMOST FATALLY INJURED. YOU KNOW HE WENT OFF LOOKING FOR EXCITEMENT. HE VOLUNTEERED, AS YOU SAID. WHAT IS REMARKABLE ABOUT THE BOOK IS IT IS, IF NOT THE EARLIEST ONE OF THE EARLIEST EFFORTS OF A VETERAN OF WAR TO TRY TO WRITE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR FROM A SOLDIERS, AN ORDINARY SOLDIER'S POINT OF VIEW.
Stephen: DO WE NEED THAT ANYMORE, WE HAVE "CALL OF DUTY" NOW? 15 HOURS OF THAT YOU'RE LIKE NO MORE CHEETOS I WANT OUT.
YOU'RE RIGHT. THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE IS ALMOST AN EXACT EQUIVALENT SEE BETWEEN CALL OF DUTY --
Stephen: THE GRAPHICS. BACK THEN THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE GRAPHICS.
NO. IT WAS LIKE 8 BIT I THINK.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOOK ITSELF. HE SURVIVED THE WAR. GOES OFF WITH CATHRYN. SHE DIES IN CHILD BIRTH.
YEAH. Stephen: SPOILER ALERT. IT SPOILS YOUR MOOD.
YA, I MEAN THE -- THE, IT'S A FUNNY BOOK IN A WAY.
Stephen: HILARIOUS. HILARIOUS. IS IT YOUR FAVORITE HEMINGWAY? HIS GREATEST BOOK.
I THINK THIS AND THEN THE SHORT STORIES CALLED THE "NICK ADAMS STORIES." IT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL. THEY TAKE A CHARACTER, NICK, FROM HIS BOYHOOD THROUGH WORLD WAR I.
Stephen: I READ THAT "OLD MAN IN THE SEA" THAT'S SUPER SHORT. I  DID A BOOK REPORT IN SIXTH GRADE.
HOW DID YOU DO? Stephen: I GOT AN "A." I DON'T WANT TO BRAG. IN THAT BOOK, YOU KNOW THERE IS AN OLD MAN. THERE IS THE SEA.
YA. Stephen: IS FREDERICK THE OLD MAN, YOU KNOW IN THIS BOOK, AND IS CATHRYN, HER NAME BEGINS WITH A "C." IS SHE THE SEA? IS THERE A PARALLEL OR IS SHE THE MARLIN?
I -- YOU KNOW THAT'S HARD TO MAKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO BOOKS.
Stephen: I DID IT I DID IT TWICE. I SHOULD OF BEEN THE GUEST ON THIS SHOW. MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. MICHAEL CHABON, THE BOOK IS "TELEGRAPH AVENUE" WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
