(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING OUR PROGRAM ALREADY IN PROGRESS, BEFORE THE HALFTIME BREAK, I WAS TAKING IT HOT AND HARD TO THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD FOR ALLOWING NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS TO FORM A UNION. IF ONE OF THOSE THUGS WERE HERE, I WOULD GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND. HERE TO RECEIVE MY MIND PIECE, PLEASE WELCOME FORMER LINEBACKER FOR UCLA AND HEAD OF THE COLLEGE ATHLETES PLAYERS ASSOCIATION, RAMOGI HUMA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE!
YOU READY FOR MY BLITZ? YOU READY! YOU READY! YOU IN MY HOUSE! YOU IN MY HOUSE! FIRST OF ALL, I DO THAT TO ALL MY GUESTS. WE USUALLY JUST EDIT IT OUT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PUSHING FOR THIS UNION THING. NOW WHEN FOOTBALL GOES AWAY FOREVER, I CAN BLAME UNIONS INSTEAD OF CONCUSSION. RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) SO WHY DO YOU FOLKS WANT COLLEGE PLAYERS TO GET PAID A SALARY?
OUR POSITION IS THAT COLLEGE ATHRETES ARE ALREADY PAID.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU WANT MORE, THEN?
WELL, THERE ARE THINGS THAT AREN'T PROVIDED. FOR INSTANCE, IF A COLLEGE ATHLETE GETS INJURED, THEY'RE NOT GUARANTEED MEDICAL EXPENSES.
Stephen: WALK IT OUT, TOUGH IT OUT. FIND THE EXTRA GEAR. DO THESE WORDS MEAN NOTHING?
IF THEY GO OUT AND GET HURT, THEY GET STUCK WITH MEDICAL EXPENSES AND FORMER PLAYERS DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SUPPORT THEM AS WELL. THEY GENERATE MULTI-BILLION DOLLARS, AND THE NCAA FACE THE SAME RISK AS THE PRO GUYS. THEY FOUND CTE WHICH IS A CONDITION THEY FOUND IN OTHER PLAYERS.
Stephen: WHAT DOES BRAIN DAMAGE HAVE TO DO WITH UNIONIZING? IF THERE WAS MORE BRAIN DAMAGE, THE PLAYERS WOULDN'T THINK TO UNIONIZE (LAUGHTER)
THE NFL PLAYERS HAVE A UNION AND ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. A COLLEGE ATHLETE COMMITTED SUICIDE, THEY FOUND BRAIN TRAUMA, AND AT THIS POINT WE SEE THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY TO GET COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION, WE FORM A UNION.
Stephen: NO ONE IS FORCING THE PLAYERS TO PLAY. THEY JUST SAY, HEY, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THIS SITUATION. WHY DON'T I, SAY, BE A THEATER MAJOR? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD POINT, BUT IN AMERICA, YOU KNOW, EMPLOYEES, NO ONE IS FORCED TO GO TO THEIR JOB, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A VOICE IN YOUR WORKPLACE FOR PROTECTION.
Stephen: WHAT -- IF PLAYERS UNIONIZE -- (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF PLAYERS, YOU KNOW, UNIONIZE, WE'VE SEEN WHAT UNIONS HAVE DONE TO EMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, ALREADY. ARE YOU READY FOR THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY'S FRONT LINE TO BE OUTSOURCED? YOU READY FOR THAT? YOU GO TO THE GAME, YOU HEAR ON THE LOUD SPEAKER, HELLO, MY NAME IS KEVIN (IN A MIDDLE EASTERN ACCENT)
Stephen: WON'T UNIVERSITIES JUST NO LONGER GIVE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS TO GET AROUND THE RULING THE SAME WAY EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES TO GET AROUND THE ObamaCare REQUIREMENT?
THAT'S NOT REALLY IN THE BOOK. THIS IS A VERY LUCRATIVE, MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY, SO THERE IS ACTUALLY AN INCENTIVE TO DRAW RECRUITS IN AND THE WAY YOU DRAW THEM IN IS OFFER THEM A SCHOLARSHIP OR MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES.
Stephen: BUT IT'S NOT IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICES. THEY'RE STUDENT ATHLETES. THAT'S THE TERM YOU SEEM TO BE MISSING OUT ON. STUDENT ATHLETES, NOT EMPLOYEES. STUDENT ATHLETES. WHAT PART OF STUDENT ATHLETE DON'T YOU GET? (LAUGHTER)
THEY'RE STUDENTS --
Stephen: YES. THEY'RE ATHLETES.
Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY, THANK YOU SO MUCH! RAMOGI HUMA FROM THE COLLEGE ATHLETES PLAYERS ASSOCIATION!
