Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. NATION FOLKS, DOINT KNOW  ABOUT YOU BUT I BELIEVE IN  THE ANCIENT MAYAN PROPHECY  THAT DECEMBER 3 1st OF 2012 WILL BRING-- BRING ABOUT THE  END 69 YEAR, IT'S ALSO  PREDICTED BY THE ANCIENT  MAYAN SEXY FIREMAN CALENDAR. FOLKS, THE END OF THE YEAR  IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF THE  YEAR. BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE  MEDIA DITCHES THEIR LAST  REMAINING VESTIGES OF  JOURNALISM AND JUST COUNTS  THINGS.
WE MUST BE GETTING CLOSE  TO THE END 69 YEAR BECAUSE  TOP TEN LISTS ARE NOW COMING  OUT.
ANDERSON COOPER WILL  REVEAL OUR TOP TEN HEROES OF  2012.

SPECIAL TOP TEN SHOWBIZ  COUNTDOWN OF THE YEAR'S MOST  EXPLOSIVE REALITY SHOWS.
Stephen: AS ALWAYS THE  NUMBER ONE EXPLOSIVE REALITY  SHOW, BOMB STARS WHERE EIGHT CELEBRITIES LIVE IN A BEACH  HOUSE AND ARE BLOWN UP. FOLKS, I LOVE NUMBERED LISTS  SO MUCH THAT I HAVE COMPILED  MY TOP TEN LISTS OF FAVORITE NUMBERS ONE THROUGH TEN. COMING IN AT NUMBER ONE FOR  THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW,  FIVE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND NOW THE FIVE THAT IS  NUMBER ONE, NUMBER FIVE IS,  OF COURSE, SEVEN. AS IN THE PHRASE SLAP ME A  HIGH SEVEN, MY NUMBER FIVE  MAN. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE MY TOP TEN NUMBERS  LIST ALWAYS MAKE MY YEARLY  LIST OF FAVORITE LISTS'S  LISTS. UNFORTUNATELY MY LIST OF  FAVORITE LISTS LISTS DID NOT  MAKE THIS YEAR'S LIST. BUT ONE LIST MAKER THAT  ALWAYS MAKES MY LIST IS  "TIME" MAGAZINE. THIS YEAR ONCE AGAIN I'M A  CONTENDER ON THEIR PERSON OF  THE YEAR LIST. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW IN PREVIOUS YEARS I HAVE  COMPETED FOR TIME'S  ATTENTION WITH MY KOREAN POP NEMESIS RAIN. RRAAIINNNN! IS NOT ON THE LIST THIS  YEAR. PERSONALLY I BLAME THE  DROUGHT. SO THIS YEAR I AM A SHOE-IN  TO TAKE IT AS LONG AS THERE  ISN'T A HUGE K POP STAR WITH KILLER DANCE MOVES CAPTURING  AMERICA'S HEART.
GANGNAM STYLE.
Stephen: PPSSYYYYYJ! HE DARES TO BE ON THE LIST  AHEAD OF ME. OH, I WILL CRUSH YOU AND THE  INVISIBLE HORSE YOU RODE IN  ON. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES, RIGHT NOW I AM AT  NUMBER FIVE WHICH YOU WILL  RECALL THIS YEAR IS NUMBER  ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SO I AM ALREADY  KIND OF WINNING. NOW OF COURSE I'M ALSO  MAKING LISTORY WITH MY NEW  BOOK, AMERICA AGAIN,  REBECOMING THE GREATNESS WE NEVER WEREN'T. BOOM! THANKS TO YOU, NATION, WE  HAVE BEEN ON "THE NEW YORK  TIMES" BEST-SELLER LIST FOR EIGHT YEARS IN A ROW. BAM LAM! BUT HERE'S THE THING. WE PEAKED AT NUMBER THREE. AND EVERY WEEK SINCE I'M  TRAILING BILL O REILLY'S  BEST-SELLERS KILLING LINCOLN, KILLING KENNEDY, AND LET'S  SAY SODOMIZING COOLIDGE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW YOU KNOW, ANYBODY  WATCHES THIS SHOW KNOWS  THERE IS NO BIGGER FAN OF BILL O'REILLY THAN BILL  HIMSELF. BUT-- I AM A CLOSE SECOND.

Jon: OH, THAT'S NICE. NO, I CANNOT ADVISE, YOU  HAVE STEPPED OVER THE LINE,  SIR! (LAUGHTER)
OKAY, OKAY. NO BIG DEAL. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT, NATION, [BLEEP] IS ON. IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO DEFEND  AMERICA, IF BY AMERICA YOU  MEAN ME, AND I USUALLY DO. TONIGHT I AM LAUNCHING  OPERATION KILLING KILLING  KENNEDY. I NEED EVERYONE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I NEED EVERYONE  WITHIN THE SOUND OF MY VOICE  TO GO BUY MY BOOK AND FOR THE RECORD THIS ISN'T ME  ABUSING OUR RELATIONSHIP BY  TELLING YOU TO BUY MY BOOK. THIS IS ME REMINDING YOU  YOU'RE GOING TOW BUY MY BOOK  EVENTUALLY. JUST DON'T DO IT IN DRIBS  AND DRABS. LET'S GET IT ALL DONE IN ONE  WEEK AND ROCK IT TO THE TOP!
