Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. INFORMATION, AFTER LIEWGZ THE  HISPANIC VOTE IN 2012, THE  G.O.P. WANTS TO APPEAL TO IMMIGRANTS, AND THE REPUBLICANS'  SECRET WEAPON IS IOWA  CONGRESSMAN AND MORTUARY TRAINING DOLL STEVE KING. ON MONDAY, CONGRESSMAN KING  WARNED US ABOUT THE REAL DANGERS  OF GRANTING CITIZENSHIPS TO YOUNG ILLEGALS THROUGH THE DREAM  ACT.
THEY AREN'T ALL  VALEDICTORIANS. THEY WEREN'T ALL BROUGHT IN BY  THEIR PARENTS FOR EVERYONE WHO  IS A VALEDICTORIAN, THERE'S ANOTHER OUT THERE WHO WEIGHS 130  POUNDS AND THEY ARE HAULING 77  POUNDS OF MARIJUANA ACROSS THE  DESERT. THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE LEGALIZED  WITH THE SAME ACT.
Stephen: COME ON! WE ALL SAY IT BEHIND CLOSED  DOORS. MEX SCRANS CALVES THE SIZE OF  CANTALOUPES, ALL RIGHT. OR HONEYDUES, WHAT HAVE YOU. A BREAKFAST FRUIT OF SOME KIND. A PAPAYA OR PARTICULARLY GRARNLG  GRAPE FRUIT, WHATEVER. ONE OF THE TWAITZ TO CHOOSE WHO  GETS INTO THIS COUNTRY IS WHAT  SIZE PRODUCE THEIR MUSCLES ARE. IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOOSING THE GOOD  ONES. STEVE KING KNOWS ONE.
YOU WANT A GOOD BIRD DOG,  PICK THE ONE THAT IS THE  FRISKIEST. YOU GET THE PICK OF THE LITTER,  AND YOU HAVE YOURSELF A PRETTY  GOOD BIRD DOG. WE GOT THE PICK OF EVERY DAWRND  CIVILIZATION ON THE PLANET.
Stephen: LOS LATINOSES WERE  OFFENDED OF THE IMMIGRANTS AS  DOGS ANALOGY. ONE OF THE PEOPLE OFFENDED WAS  FRIEND OF THE SHOW UNIVISION  A.F.C.OR JORGE RAMOS.
YOU RECENTLY COMPARED  IMMIGRANTS TO DOGS.
NO, I DIDN'T. THAT'S A MISCHARACTERIZATION.
DID YOU WATCH THE VIDEO? THE FULL VIDEO? THAT SPEECH WAS ABOUT  CELEBRATING LEGAL IMMIGRATION. ANYONE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE  LANGUAGE AND THE CULTURE KNOWS  THAT IF THEY SAW THE VIDEO.
Stephen: IF YOU WEREN'T  SUCH A FOREIGNER, YOU'D GET IT! TAKE THE JUMPING BEANS OUT OF  YOUR EARS, PEDRO. TRY AGAIN.
SO FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW,  YOU ACTUALLY DID NOT COMPARE  IMMIGRANTS TO DOGS?
THAT'S-- I SAID THAT SPEECH  WAS ABOUT THE VIGOR OF LEGAL  IMMIGRATION. IT WAS A VERY COMPLIMENTARY  SPEECH.
Stephen: YES, WHEN HE WAS  COMPARING IMMIGRANTS TO DOGS,  WHICH HE DID NOT DO, HE WAS COMPLIMENTING THEM. THE SAME WAY I'M COMPLIMENTING  STEVE KING WHEN I CALL HIM A  TOOL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). MEANING-- MEANING-- THAT'S A  CELEBRATION, OKAY. MEANING A USEFUL IMPLEMENT WITH  WHICH TO SAY ROOF A HOUSE. BY THE WAY, STEVE KING BELIEVES  ROOF IS THE SPANISH WORD FOR  HELLO AS IN ROOF-ROOF. SO, PLEASE, IT'S NOT ABOUT  MEXICANS BEING ANIMALS. STEVE KING IS JUST SAYING THEY  ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO, IF YOU  PICK THE RIGHT ONES, WOULD MAKE GREAT PETS. I'VE ALREADY GOT ONE DIGGING IN  MY YARD. LUIS IS LOYAL. HE'S A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY. AND AT THE FIRSTï¿½i SIGN OF HIP  DISSPLAISHIA I WILL SEND HIM TO  A FARM UPSTATE. I HAVE A LONG OF STRING BEANS
