WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  MY GUEST TONIGHT'S,  SINGER/SONGWRITER WHOSE'S ALBUM THE MISSING YEARS IS  BEING RE-RELEASED ON VINYL. I CAN'T WAIT TO DOWNLOAD IT.
PLEASE WELCOME JOHN PRIN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANKS CORE FOLLOWING  CON.
I'M AN ENORMOUS FAN,  ENORMOUS FAN. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
GREAT TO BE HERE, THANK  YOU.
Stephen: ARE YOU AS I  SAID BEFORE A GRAMMY  AWARD-WINNING, REALLY FOLK  SINGER, SONGWRITER,  SONGWRITER. YOU'RE A LEGEND IN YOUR OWN  TIME. BUT YOU STARTED OFF AS A  MAILMAN.
YES, I DID, YEAH.
Stephen: WERE YOU A  MAILMAN'S MAILMAN?
I WAS.
Stephen: WERE YOU THE  KIND OF MAILMAN THAT OTHER  MAILMEN WANTED TO GET THEIR MAIL FROM?
I WAS THE KIND OF MAILMAN  THAT DOGS COULDN'T WAIT TO  SEE COMING DOWN THE STREET.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU  LEAVE A STEADY JOB AND GO  INTO A SHAKY BUSINESS LIKE  MUSIC?
BECAUSE I WAS MAKING MORE  MONEY IN THE BUSINESS AS  WALKING IN THE SNOW.
Stephen: SO FOLK-MUSIC  WAS WHERE THE BIG MONEY WAS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I GOT A BEEF  WITH YOU, JOHN PRINE, I'M AN  ENORMOUS FAN AS I SAID. BUT YOU LIKE TO KEEP IT  SIMPLE. IT'S MOSTLY JUST VOCALS AND  GUITAR.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY NOT FLASH  MOB, FACEPAINT, WHY NOT  SOMEONE TWERKING AGAINST YOU WHILE YOU'RE DOING YOUR  SONGS?
THAT WOULD PUT ME IN A  DIFFERENT TAX BRACKET. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MY FAVORITE SONG  OF YOUR, ONE OF MY FAVORITE  SONGS OF ALL TIMES IS CALLED HOW LUCKY. NOW THE SONG HAS LYRICS,  GOES TODAY I WALK DOWN THE  STREET, I USED TO WANDER. AND I SCRATCH-- I SHOOK MY  HEAD AND MADE MYSELF A BET. ALL THESE THINGS THAT I DONE  THINK I REMEMBER, HOW LUCKY  CAN ONE MAN GET. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU  DON'T REMEMBER?
(LAUGHTER)
I CAN'T RECALL THEM RIGHT  NOW.
Stephen: WELL, WE'VE GOT  A NEW RELEASE OF YOUR  CLASSIC ALBUM THE MISSING YEARS WHICH WAS RELEASED IN  1991 BUT NOT AVAILABLE ON  VINYL THEN BUT AVAILABLE ON VINYL NOW. THE MISSING YEARS REFERS TO  JESS SUS MISSING YEARS.
YES. FROM THE TIME HE WAS 13 TO I  GUESS ABOUT 18, 19. BUT-- .
Stephen: WE DONE KNOW  WHAT HAPPENED THEN.
NOBODY DID. I DON'T KNOW WHY.
Stephen: DO YOU FILL IN  THOSE MISSING YEARS.
I HAVE AS GOOD A GUESS AS  ANYBODY.
Stephen: THAT'S HERESY  YOU REALIZE. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, JOHN, WOULD YOU DO A  SONG FOR US, PLEASE.
I WOULD LOVE TO  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY  JOHN PRINE. STICK AROUND.
