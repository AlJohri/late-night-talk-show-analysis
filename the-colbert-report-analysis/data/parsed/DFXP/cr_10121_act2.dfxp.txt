Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS, BUT I FOR ONE, I AM STILL REELING FROM ERIC CANTOR'S STUNNING PRIMARY LOSS TO A TEA PARTY CHALLENGER. VIRGINIA HAS NOT SEEN THIS KIND OF UPSET SINCE ROBERT LEE TURNED OUT TO BE THE SECOND GREATEST MILITARY MIND OF HIS ERA. CLEARLY EVERYONE WHO THOUGHT THE TEA PARTY WAS DEAD IN THE WATER FORGOT HOW IMPORTANT WATER IS IN THE TEA-MAKING PROCESS. THAT'S JUST SCIENCE. THE ONLY SCIENCE THEY ACCEPT, BY THE WAY. AND NOW YET ANOTHER REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT COULD BE TEA PARTIED IN MISSISSIPPI. TALK RADIO HOST CHRIS McDANIEL IS IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RUN-OFF AGAINST INCUMBENT SENATOR AND SITCOM GRANDPA THAD COCHRAN. McDANIEL HAS AN EIGHT-POINT LEAD OVER COCHRAN BECAUSE HE'S REINFORCED A NARRATIVE THAT THE SIX-TERM SENATOR COCHRAN IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH MISSISSIPPI. BUT SENATOR COCHRAN RECENTLY GAVE A SPEECH AT WHAT  APPARENTLY WAS A "MATLOCK" CONVENTION. [LAUGHTER] WHERE HE PROVED HIS MISSISSIPPI DOWN-HOME ROOTS.
MY FATHER'S FAMILY WAS HERE. MY MOTHER'S FAMILY WAS FROM RURAL HINDS COUNTY UTICA. IT WAS FUN. IT WAS AN ADVENTURE. TO BE OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY AND TO SEE WHAT GOES ON, PICKING UP PECANS FROM THAT TO ALL KINDS OF INDECENT THINGS WITH ANIMALS. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YES. INDECENT THINGS WITH ANIMALS. NOW THERE'S MAN OF THE PEOPLE. AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT AVAILABLE, ANYTHING WARM. FOLKS, THIS IS HOW YOU WIN AN ELECTION BY IMPLYING THAT YOU BANGED A COW. COCHRAN'S MESSAGE IS: I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE BIG-CITY TYPES WHO DOES DECENT THINGS WITH ANIMALS. PERSONALLY I WANT TO THANK COCHRAN. I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH ISN'T THAT FAR FROM MISSISSIPPI, JUST A FEW HUNDRED MILES AS THE SHEEP FLEES. AND ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE DEALT WITH HATEFUL STEREOTYPES ABOUT SOUTHERNERS. BUT NOW SENATOR COCHRAN HAS STEPPED UP AND SHOWN THE WORLD A POSITIVE IMAGE OF SOUTHERNERS. WE'RE INTELLIGENT, CARING PEOPLE WHO ALSO [BLEEPED] ANIMALS. I MEAN, WHY, THINK ABOUT IT, WHY DO YOU THINK... WHY DO YOU THINK WE EAT SO MUCH BARBECUE? WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE WITNESSES. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS A GAME CHANGER, FOLKS. IF McDANIEL WANTS TO HAVE ANY CHANCE IN THE PRIMARY, HE NEEDS TO KNOCK OUT A FEW TEETH, PUT ON A STRAW HAT AND ONE-STRAP OVERALLS AND SHOW UP TO HIS NEXT STUMP SPEECH WITH ONE HAND  HOLDING A JUG OF MOONSHINE AND THE OTHER ONE HOLDING HIS  SISTER'S  TITTY. OTHERWISE I'M AFRAID IT WILL BE SENATOR COCHRAN HAVING THE VICTORY PARTY AT CAMPAIGN  HEADQUARTERS, AND, OF COURSE, THE VICTORY AFTER-PARTY AT THE  PETTING ZOO. BY THE WAY, REPUBLICAN SQUIRREL,  STAY THE HELL OUT OF MISSISSIPPI. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
