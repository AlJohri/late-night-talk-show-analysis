STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU LAZIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, HEAR UG CHANT MY NAME T SOUNDS LIKE THE ANGEL CHIR CHOIRS OF BETHLEHEM. MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY. I LOVE CHRISTMAS, IT'S JUST A MAGICAL TIME OF YEAR. BUT THANKS TO COMRADE DICKENS THE CHRISTMAS CAROL SEIG HEIL, CHUCK. THE CHRISTMAS SEASON IS ALWAYS OPEN SEASON ON TITANS OF FINANCE. EBENEZER SCROOGE WAS A JOB CREATOR. WHAT DID TINY TIM EVER MAKE OTHER THAN ME CRY. WELL, THIS CHRISTMAS THE MEDIAN INCOME HUGGERS OUT THERE ARE STILL PUSHING BANKERS AROUND AND NO ONE IS GETTING HID HARDER THAN MY BUDDY C.E.O. JAMIE DIMON. FOR MORE WE GO TO NBC AN FOUR GRADER TRICK-OR-TREATING RACHEL MADDOW.
THE NEAREST AND DEEREST TO JAYIE DIMON THIS HOLIDAY SEE BE, RECENTLY GRACED WITH THIS PANORAMIC HOLIDAY CARD IN YOUR MAIL BOX. IT SHOWS THE FIRST FAMILY OF FINANCE HAVING A GREAT TIME HITTING TENNIS BALLS INSIDE WHAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR HOME. AND SAYS HEY, WE'RE SO RICH WE CAN DESTROY OUR OWN STUFF WITH A SMILE.
Stephen: DISGUSTING. CALF OR THING AROUND YOUR OWN HOME WITH YOUR OWN FAMILY? AT CHRISTMASTIME. COME ON. I CONDITION THINK OF ANYTHING MORE DECADENT EXCEPT MAYBE MURDERING A TREE AND DRESSING IT UP LIKE A WHORE. NO WONDER, NOnd WITHOUTER, FOLKS, NO WONDER "TIME" MAGAZINE CALLED THE CARDS MADDENINGLY TONE DEAF AND ASK COULD YOU PICK A MORE ELITIST SPORT? YES, ELITIST, TEN SIS JUST POLO WITHOUT A HORSE THAT CAN BE PLAYED IN A PUBLIC PARK. JAMIE DIE UPON FORGOT THE GOLDEN RULE OF 1 PERCENTERS, THE 99ERS NEED TO PREVIOUS YOUR MONEY HAS MADE YOU MISERABLE. HIS CHRISTMAS CARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIM WEEPING ALONE ON A PILE OF MONEY. FOLKS, THIS IS WHY, THIS IS WHY, I DIDN'T MAIL OUT MY CHRISTMAS CARD THIS YEAR. IT'S A PICTURE OF ME WATER-SKIING THROUGH THE KITCHEN HI BUILT OFF OF MY TWO CLOSETS. FOLKS, I TELL YOU, THEY CRITICIZE BUT I NEED THAT KEVIN. THE SHERPAS WHO GUIDE ME TO MY SANDAL SHELF ARE HUNGRY. SO AS MUCH AS I HATE TO DO IT, SHAME ON YOU JAMIE DIMON. AND NEWS MEDIA, YOU KEEP HOLDING THE BANKERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR INSENSITIVE CHRISTMAS CARDS BECAUSE I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE, THAT'S THE REAL CRIME ON WALL STREET. NATION, I LOVE--  (APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I LOVE CHRISTMAS. IT'S SUCH A JOYFUL SEASON. AND THAT JOY IS HARD ON FOX NEWS BECAUSE THEIR JOB IS TO MAKE US SCARED AND ANDRY. THAT'S WHY THIS TILE OF THE YEAR THEY BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS LIKE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND VANILLA PUDDING SKIN-- TO GIVE YOU THE GIFT OF ANXIETY. SET THEM UP, DECEMBER.

FINALLY, THE PENULTIMATE MISTLE TOE MADNESS BE DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ON-LINE. THEY'RE TRYING TO BILK YOU.
Stephen: NOW THAT'S A LOT OF WARNINGS, SO LET'S REVIEW. YOUR STRANDED LOVED ONES ARE ALL LIARS [BLEEP] THEM. IF YOU BUY A DOG ON-LINE, IT WILL HAVE FLEE, WHICH ARE INCURABLE SO YOU HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN IN FRONT OF THE KIDS, MERRY CHRISTMAS. AND FINALLY, FINALLY, THE PENULTIMATE, DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ON-LINE. IT APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED TO PETER JOHNSON, JR.. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, YOU CHAT WITH THE UKRAINIAN WOMAN ON-LINE, BUY HER AN AIRLINE TICKET TO VIT, YOU MARRY HER AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW HER BROTHER IS MOVING IN, FOR SOME REASON HE'S THE ONE WITHOUT GETS TO SLEEP WITH HER, OR SO I'VE BEEN TOLD. I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU HE CATERINA. I AM THIS CLOSE TO CHANGE THE PIN ON MY BANK CARD. NOW FOLKS, AFTER HEARING THAT LITTLE LIST OF SCAMS THERE, I HOPE YOU'RE SO SCARED THAT YOU DROP THE YULE LOG IN YOUR PANTS. BUT JUNIOR JOHNSON PETER ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE SCAMS THAT HE LEFT OUT. LIKE GIFT DRIFT, WHERE YOU BUY A PRESENT AND ARE YOU EXPECTED TO GIVE THAT TO SEBLS. HEY, I JUST PAID FOR THAT, WHY SHOULD I GIVE IT AWAY. AND THE KNOCKOUT GAME WHERE A TEENAGER KNOCKS YOU OUT WITH A FROZEN CARTON OF EGG NOTHING AND SPRINKLES YOU WITH NUTMEG, IT'S SWEEPING THE COUNTRY, FOLKS. -- PEOPLE ARE DOING IT. KRINGLE KRUNCH THAT ONE IS SELF-EXPLANATORY, FROSTY FROST, WHERE A SNOWMAN STEALS YOUR IDENTITY, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE'S SLEEPING WITH YOUR WIFE AND YOUR KIDS ARE CALLING HIM DADDIE AND IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT FOR BRINGING HIM TO LIFE WITH THAT MAGIC HAT, DON'T DO IT. AND FINALLY, SANTA CLAUS, HUGE SCAM. NEVER ONCE DID HE BRING GIFTS TO MY CHILDREN. AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD GIFTS. I MEAN THEY GIVE ME PRESENTS EVERY YEAR AND YET THEY GET NOTHING. I DON'T GET IT I DON'T GET IT. HE BROUGHT ME PRESENTS WHEN I WAS A KID. WHY DID HE STOP? SANTA CLAUS, LISTEN UP OLD MAN, I AM GIVING YOU ONE MORE CHANCE, DO NOT DISAPPOINT MY CHILDREN THIS CHRISTMAS. BECAUSE I'VE GOT 18 YEARS 6 MILK AND COOKIES ON MY MANTLE
