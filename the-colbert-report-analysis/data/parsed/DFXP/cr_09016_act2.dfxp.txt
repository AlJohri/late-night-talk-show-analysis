Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN  A BOOK CALLED KEEPING THE  REPUBLIC, SAVING AMERICA BY  TRUSTING AMERICANS. PERSONALLY I WOULD HAVE PUT  A LITTLE MORE AMERICA IN THE  TITLE. PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR  MITCH DANIELS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GF NEVER, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU THE  REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF  INDIANA.
FOR TWO MORE MONTHS.
Stephen: PREVIOUSLY  DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF  MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET UNDER  GEORGE BUSH. SENIOR ADVISOR TO REAGAN,  YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A  LONG TIME, OKAY. AND YOU'VE GOT A BOOK HERE,  OUT IN PAPERBACK NOW CALLED  KEEPING THE REPUBLIC, SAVING  AMERICA BY TRUSTING  AMERICANS. SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? DO I HAVE TO TRUST ALL  AMERICANS? BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS  THERE ARE ABOUT 47% WHO ARE  PARASITES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  CAN WE TRUST EACH OTHER?
YEAH, SURE. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THE  POINT, STEPHEN, IS THAT  DEMOCRACY REALLY ONLY WORKS  IF PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. AND I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS  WITH PERFECTLY GOOD  INTENTIONS BELIEVE THAT YOU  OR I MAYBE WE'RE JUST  VICTIMS, YOU KNOW, AND WE NEED THEM TO PAGE DECISION  FOR US. WE MIGHT PICK THE WRONG  MORTGAGE OR THE WRONG CREDIT  CARD OR THE WRONG HEALTH  CARE. WE MIGHT PICK THE WRONG  LIGHT BULB, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
SO YOU KNOW-- .
Stephen: WE MIGHT BUY  PAINT THAT HAS LEAD IN IT. WE MIGHT DRIVE CARS THAT  HAVE LEAD IN IT. WE MIGHT LIVE NEXT TO A  NUCLEAR POWER PLANT THAT HAS  THESE BURDENSOME REGULATIONS  ON IT, ALL OF THESE DANGEROUS THINGS THAT MAKE  US VICTIMS.
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, I  JUST THINK THAT-- IT IS MORE  CONSISTENT FIRST WITH HUMAN  DIGNITY TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHOICES  FOR THEMSELVES. AND I THINK INCREASINGLY WE  SORT OF HAVE SHRUNK THE ZONE  OF FREEDOM. AND THERE IS A SECOND  DIMENSION I SHOULD ADD. I THINK A LOT OF OUR  POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES,  I'M HAPPY TO SAY, OR UNHAPPY  TO ADMIT, REALLY DON'T BELIEVE AMERICANS CAN HANDLE  THE TRUTH ABOUT REALLY HUGE  PROBLEM WE HAVE, THE SINGLE  BIGGEST ONE WHICH IS THE DEBT WE'VE PILED UP AND ARE  ABOUT TO DUMP ON THE NEXT  GENERATION. I HAPPEN TO THINK AMERICANS  CAN BE TALKED TO ABOUT THIS. AND I, I WILL BE HAPPIER  WHEN BOTH PARTIES ARE.
Stephen: NOW WE HAVE A  SURPLUS WHEN BILL CLINTON  LEFT OFFICE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: AND WERE GEORGE  W. BUSH'S DIRECTOR OF  MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET. WHO CAME IN AND CHLOROFORMED  YOU AND STOLE ALL THE MONEY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, THE ANSWER IS THE  DOTCOM BUBBLE BROKE AND THE  MONEY PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS  COMING DID NOT SHOW UP. WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED IF  YOU WERE PRESIDENT, STEPHEN,  WHICH MAYBE YOU WILL BE ONE  DAY.
Stephen: I THOUGHT ABOUT  IT.
I KNOW.
Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE GOT  THIS BOOK HERE. PEOPLE, GOVERNORS WHO  RELEASE BOOKS ARE OFTEN  TESTING THE WATERS FOR THE  PRESIDENCY. ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT  JUMPING IN? THERE ARE 12 DAYS LEFT. THAT'S LONGER THAN THE  ENTIRE TIM PAWLENTY  CAMPAIGN.
I WROTE THE BOOK IN LEW,  ACTUALLY, OF RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT MYSELF. I WAS JUST TRYING TO  CONTRIBUTE A FEW THOUGHTS  WITHOUT-- WITHOUT TAKING  THAT ON.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT  THIS BOOK REMINDED ME OF?
I'M AFRAID TO ASK, BUT  WHAT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: REMINDS ME OF MY  BOOK, AMERICA AGAIN. SAVING AMERICA, AMERICA  AGAIN. REBECOME THE GREATNESS WE  NEVER WEREN'T. YOU KNOW WHAT, ON AMAZON  PEOPLE WHO BUY THIS BOOK  OFTEN BUY THIS BOOK TOO. I'LL ENDORSE YOUR BOOK IF  YOU WILL ENDORSE MINE.
DONE.
Stephen: READY? GO BUY HIS BOOK.
MY WHOLEHEARTED  ENDORSEMENT FOR THIS EPIC  WORK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, TELL YOU  WHAT, GOVERNOR, WE ARE GOING  TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. STICK AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF  MINUTES WHEN YOU COME BACK,  ALL RIGHT.
AND IF I SAID NO.
Stephen: I WOULD LOCK THE  DOOR.
YEAH, OKAY.
Stephen: WELL ANSWER  RIGHT BACK. WITH GOVERNOR MITCH DANIELS. THANK YOU SOP MUCH.
