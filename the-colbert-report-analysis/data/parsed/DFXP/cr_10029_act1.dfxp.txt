Stephen: TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA CELEBRATES THANKSGIVING AND, JUST LIKE YOUR UNCLE, HE SPENT THE WHOLE MEAL BITCHING ABOUT OBAMACARE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEN A BREAKTHROUGH IN ONLINE SHOPPING-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ORDER, THE N.S.A. KNOWS WHAT YOU NEED. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST, DANIEL GOLEMAN IS A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO SAYS THE POOR ARE MORE CARING THAN THE RICH. HU. FOR SOME REASON I DON'T GIVE A (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) A NEW STUDY FOUND THAT ENERGY DRINK CANS ALTER YOUR HEART FUNCTION. SO RID BULL GIVES YOU WINGS BUT THEY MIGHT BE ANGEL WINGS. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. GOOD TO SEE YOU. NICE TO HAVE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"). OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I CAN'T ASK FOR ANY MORE THAN THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. IN THERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GREAT THANKSGIVING. I SURE DID. STILL WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THE LEFTOVERS, OF COURSE. THIS MORNING I USED GRAVY AS A MOISTURIZER. (LAUGHTER) HAD TO, REALLY, MY SKIN WAS DRIED OUT AFTER SHAVING WITH THOSE MASHED POTATOES. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THANKSGIVING AS ALWAYS REMINDED ME OF WHAT I'M MOST GRATEFUL FOR-- THAT POOR PEOPLE STILL CAN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THE OBAMACARE WEB SITE REMAINS A DISASTER. EVEN THOUGH NOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S WEB SITE GURUS ARE BRAGGING THAT healthcare.gov IS WORKING MORE THAN 90% OF THE TIME. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK. GET ON THE SCHOOL BUS, KIDS! PRINCIPAL OBAMA SAYS THE BRIDGE IS 0% COMPLETE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I CAN SEE WHY THE ADMINISTRATION HADN'T GOT THE HEALTH CARE WEB SITE UP TO SPEED YET-- BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES.
EVERY THANKS GIVING THE PRESIDENT CHOOSES ONE TURKEY TO PARDON.
WELL, TONIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS LETTING YOU INFLUENCE THE DECISION BY VOTING ON LINE.
UNCLE SAM NEEDS YOU TO VOTE. SO DO THESE TURKEYS, CARAMEL AND POPCORN, THE FINALIST FOR NATIONAL THANKSGIVING TURKEYS. ONLY ONE BIRD CAN HOLD THE TITLE. YOU CAN VOTE ONLINE. STAY TUNED TO SEE WHO WINS.
Stephen: OH, I UNDERSTAND WHY healthcare.gov IS SCREWED: OBAMA NEEDED HIS A-TEAM TO WORK ON TURKEYCARE . GOBBLE. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. YOU SEE, THE PRESIDENTIAL TURKEY PARDON THIS YEAR WAS DECIDED BY AN ONLINE VOTE. IT'S LIKE "HOT OR NOT" WHERE HOT IS DEFINED AS 375 DEGREES FOR THREE HOURS. (LAUGHTER) WHAT A WASTE OF AMERICA'S TIME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! BECAUSE ANY FOOL CAN SEE THAT POPCORN IS THE BETTER TURKEY! I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THE ACTUAL STATS THEY PROVIDE RIGHT ON THE WEB SITE. POPCORN IS A LEAN AND SEXY 37 POUNDS WHILE CARAMEL IS A LUMBERING TUBBO AT 38 POUNDS. HEY, FATSO, DID YOU ALREADY EAT THE CHICKEN AND THE DUCK? WHY WOULD ANYBODY VOTE FOR CARAMEL WHO LISTENS TO LADY GAGA WHEN POPCORN JAMS OUT TO BEYONCE. COME ON, CARAMEL. LADY GAGA ISN'T YOUR FRIEND. SHE'S ALREADY DRESSED UP AS THREE OF THE FOUR MAJOR FOOD GROUPS. WHEREAS BEYONCE SANG "I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY FOR THIS JELLY" WHICH IS CLEARLY A SONG ABOUT HOW POPCORN IS NOT READY TO BE SERVED WITH CRANBERRY SAUCE. (LAUGHTER) LONG STORY SHORT, CARAMEL IS A LOSER AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME.
AN ANNUAL THANKSGIVING TRADITION PRESIDENT OBAMA PARDONING THIS YEAR'S TURKEY, POPCORN IS THE NAME OF THE TURKEY, RECEIVING THE PRESIDENTIAL PARDON. POPCORN BEAT A TURKEY NAMED CARAMEL FOR THE HONOR.
Stephen: BOOM! SUCK IT, CARAMEL! THE INTERNET HAS SPOKEN AND THEY DECIDED YOU LOSE. AND SINCE IT'S THE INTERNET, THEY'VE ALSO DECIDED THAT YOU'RE GAY! RON PAUL 2012. (LAUGHTER) NOT SURE WHICH OF THOSE TWO YOU'RE APPLAUDING FOR BUT THANK YOU. BUT NATION THERE'S A DARK SIDE TO THIS STORY OF TWO CAGED ANIMAL KOS PETEING TO NOT-DIE. NEITHER OF THEM DIE.
HOWEVER, WHEN THE ONLINE VOTING ENDED EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS GOING TO TAKE A STAND AND CARAMEL WAS GOING TO GET EXECUTED THE WHITE HOUSE TWEETED, IN FACT, NO, NO, NO, THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO LIVE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT! OUR COWARD IN CHIEF WASN'T SATISFIED PULLING OUT OF IRAQ AND PULLING OUT OF AFGHANISTAN. NOW HE'S PULLING OUT OF TURKEY. (LAUGHTER) MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE DOES THIS SEND THE KIDS? WHAT DO PARENTS SAY WHEN THEIR CHILD LOOKS UP WITH THOSE BIG WET EYES AND ASK: "MOMMY, WHY DO THINGS HAVE TO NOT DIE?" THIS IS THE WEAKENING OF OUR DEMOCRACY! ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES, SIR! NEXT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME THAT THE LOSING MISS AMERICA CONTESTANTS GET TO LIVE! (LAUGHTER) WELL, NATION, I FOR ONE AM NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT. THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING. ALSO WHY I'VE STARTED A PETITION AT colbertnation.com CALLING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO LIVE UP TO THE DUTIES OF HIS OFFICE AND EXECUTE CARAMEL THE TURKEY. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY? SO HEAD TO colbertnation.com AND SIGN MY PETITION. BY THE WHITE HOUSE'S OWN RULES, IF WE GET 100,000 RESPONSES IN 30 DAYS THEY HAVE TO RESPOND. SOON OBAMA COULD BE GIVING THAT LOSER CARAMEL WHAT HE'S GOT COMING TO HIM. HOPEFULLY LETTING POPCORN WATCH. HE EARNED IT. (LAUGHTER) NOW, SPEAKING OF THE HOLIDAYS, FOLKS, I WANT TO WISH YOU ALL A MERRY SOONER MONDAY! AND FOR ANY NON-CHRISTIAN VIEWERS. HAPPY ROBOT CHANUKAH. NOW, I SPENT MY CYBER MONDAY CYBERRING ON amazon.com BECAUSE I LOVE THEIR OVERNIGHT DELIVERY SERVICE. I LIKE TO SNUGGLE UNDER THE COVERS WITH THE HAPPY THOUGHT THAT IN THE NEXT THREE HOURS MY NEW THREE-SPEED CAN OPENER WILL MOVE TO A DIFFERENT WAREHOUSE. AMAZON'S OVERNIGHT DELIVERY OF SUCH ITEMS AS 15 FOOT TRAMPOLINES AND $25,000 84 INCH TELEVISIONS HAS ONE FATAL FLAW. IT TAKES FOREVER! (LAUGHTER) IF I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW FOR MY ITEMS TO ARRIVE THERE GOES TONIGHT'S PLANS TO WATCH "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL" WHILE DOING BACK FLIPS ON MY TRAMPOLINE. (LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY, AMAZON C.E.O. AND BILLIONAIRE BUSYTOWN WORM JEFF BEZOS -- (LAUGHTER). HE GETS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AND IS HE'S DOING SOMETHING TO SOLVE IT.
THESE ARE OCTOCOPTERS. THESE ARE EFFECTIVELY TKREPB BUS THERE'S NO REASONS THEY CAN'T BE USED AS DELIVERY VEHICLES. WE CAN DO HALF HOUR DELIVERY.
HALF HOUR TKHR +EUFLY.
AND WE CAN CARRY OBJECTS UP TO FIVE POUNDS WHICH COVERS 86% OF THE ITEMS THAT WE DELIVER.
Stephen: FOLKS, THESE AMAZON DRONES ARE A GREAT IDEA. AND GUARANTEED TO BE SAFE THANKS TO ALL THE DRONE TESTING WE'VE DONE OVERSEAS! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WORST-CASE SCENARIO, A FEW HOMES GET CARPET GIFTED WITH SOME COLLATERAL GENEROSITY. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR HOW SIMPLE IT IS WHEN THERE'S THIS CAREFULLY-PRODUCED SHORT FILM FROM AMAZON. THERE'S THE DRONE PICKING UP THE PACKAGE AND FLYING OUT OF THE WAREHOUSE NAVIGATING THROUGH THE PARTS OF AMERICA WITH NO TREES, PHONE LINES, OR BUILDINGS THEN LANDING ON YOUR DOORSTEP WHILE YOUR FAMILY COWERS INSIDE UNTIL AFTER THE SEMIAUTONOMOUS BLADE WIELDING OCTOCOPTER LEAVES. YES, NATION, FLYING PRODUCTS TO OUR DOORSTEP INSIDE OF HALF AN HOUR IS A BOLD PLAN RIGHT OUT OF SCIENCE FICTION. IT LEAVES MY WITH ONLY ONE QUESTION: WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG? I WANT MY STUFF NOW! AND I KNOW HOW TO GET IT. SO PUT ON YOUR FUTURE HAT, JEFF BEZOS BECAUSE I'VE COOKED UP AN IDEA THAT WILL BRING BUYING AS WE KNOW IT TO A NEW LEVEL. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PICTURE THIS. I'M GOING TO KEEP MY EYES OPEN BECAUSE I HAVE TO READ THESE WORDS HERE BUT EVERYBODY ELSE, HERE'S THE IDEA. AMAZON LOCATIONS THAT CUSTOMERS CAN WALK INTO AND BUY THINGS! (LAUGHTER) AND THE INVENTORY WOULD BE ARRANGED NOT AS DROPDOWN MENUS BUT ROWS OF PHYSICAL MERCHANDISE A CUSTOMER CAN ACTUALLY TOUCH! AND INSTEAD OF WAITING PRECIOUS MINUTES FOR A DRONE TO ARRIVE THEY CAN PLACE THEIR SELECTIONS INTO A WHEELED BASKET CONVEYANCE. IT'S INSPIRED BY YOUR WEB SITE'S ABSTRACT CART GRAPHIC. (LAUGHTER) THUS, THEY HAVE THE PRODUCTS INSTANTLY. I CALL IT AMAZON LIVE. CALL ME, BEZOS. YOUR MONEY AND MY IDEA WE CAN HAVE THESE SPENDING HABIT OPPORTUNITY PLACES-- OR SHOPS, AS I CALL THEM-- UP AND RUNNING BY 2025. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
