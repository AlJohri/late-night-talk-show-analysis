( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NATION, CHECK YOUR CALENDARS BECAUSE THANKSGIVING IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, AND, FOLK, IT IS MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY, WHICH IS A BIT SURPRISING SINCE I'M NO FAN OF GIVING OR SAYING THANKS. ( LAUGHTER ) EVERY YEAR, WHEN I CELEBRATE IT, I PUSH THE ENVELOPE. LAST YEAR, I HAD A GRAVY BOAT. THIS YEAR I HAVE A GRAVY KAYAK. BUT, SADLY, FOLKS-- YEAH, YEAH. LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, DOESN'T IT? SADLY, AMERICA'S SACRED DAY DEDICATED TO FAMILY AND HEARINGNANA'S UNVARNISHED OPINION OF PHILIPPINEOS IS IN IS IN DANGER BECAUSE THIS IS THANKSGIVING UNDER ATTACK. ( GUNFIRE ) ( GOBBLE )
IF YOU NEED-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IF YOU NEED SOME EXPLANATION AS TO WHY JESUS IS COMING OUT OF THE TOMB, WEARING A PILGRIM HAT AND A BLUNDERBUSS, WATCH SOME OF OUR SHOWS FROM ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. NATION, THE THANKSGIVING TABLE IS GOING TO BE EXTRA CROWDED THIS YEAR. NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVEN'T WALKED OFF LAST YEAR'S GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE.
TURKEY DAY MEETS THE JEWISH FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS THIS YEAR. IN A RARE CONVERGENCE, THANKSGIVING FALLS ON THE FIRST DAY OF HANUKKAH.
Stephen:  HOW DARE YOU, HANUKKAH! THESE TWO HOLIDAYS HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON. HANUKKAH CELEBRATES THE STRUGGLE OF AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE'S FIGHT AGAINST INVADING CONKERS, WHILE THANKSGIVING IS ABOUT OUR HEALTHY AND NURTURING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIANS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  NOW, NOW-- BUT NOW THEY'RE OVERLAPPING. AND KEEPING THE STORY STRAIGHT IS GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE. PRETTY SOON, SCHOOL KIDS WILL THINK THANKSGIVING STARTED WHEN THE WAMPANOAG SAT DOWN WITH THE YAKABEES, AND THE YAMS LASTED EIGHT NIGHTS. FOLKS, IT WASN'T A MIR TELEKELL. NOBODY LIKES YAMS. REALLY, AH, REALLY? SYMPATHY FOR THE YAMS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW, INSTEAD OF DRAWING A HAND TURKEY, WE'LL BE EXPECTED TO DRAW A HAND MENORAH. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE! YOU NEED BOTH HANDS TO MAKE THE MENORAH, AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DRAW WITH? IT CAN'T BE DONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE SHAMS OSH IS NOT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE SHAMS OSH IS NOT STRAIGHT. I'M SORRY. NATION-- NOW IT'S ON MY FACE. THAT IS NOT COMING OUT. THAT'S IT. ANYWAY, NATION, I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I WANT TO WARN OUR ANILLATES WE MIGHT BE GOING A LITTLE BIT LONG TONIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DISCUSSING HANUKKAH AND I DREW A MUSTACHE RIGHT THERE. THAT IS BAD FORM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). REALLY, REALLY NOT GOOD. FOLKS, I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. I HAVE NEVER, EVER TRUSTED HANUKKAH. IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MANY ALIASES. PLUS, PLUS HANUKKAH IS SUPPOSED TO OVERLAP WITH CHRISTMAS. SO I CAN SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS INSTEAD OF HAPPY HOLIDAYS, AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHICH HOLIDAY I'M NOT WISHING THEY HAVE A HAPPY ONE OF. SO THIS YEAR, FOLKS, TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS CONFUSED I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND THANKSGIVING WISHING EVERYBODY A MERRY CHRISTMAS. IT'S CHAOS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, HANUKKAH, I'VE HAD IT UP TO HEAR BLOCKING OUR HOLIDAYS. I DO NOT-- LISTEN TO ME EYE DO NOT WANT TO SEE HANUKKAH STARTING ON THANKSGIVING DAY FOR ANOTHER 80,000 YEARS.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN FOR ANOTHER-- GET THIS-- 79,000 YEARS.
Stephen:  NOW YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PISS ME OFF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
