WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW  YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN  FIGHTING ALL YEAR TO STAMP  OUT VOTER FRAUD. BECAUSE IF EVEN ONE FRAUD  CENTER SHOWS UP AT THE POLLS  IN NOVEMBER THAT WOULD  TARNISH THE INTEGRITY OF AN ELECTION THAT THE KOCH  BROTHERS PAID GOOD MONEY  FOR. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I HAVE  TWO COLBERT VOTER FRAUD  ALERTS. FIRST UP FIRST UP MY SOURCE  TELL ME THAT JUST SIX DAYS  BEFORE THE ELECTION MILLIONS  OF AMERICANS ARE PLANNING TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS SOME  SORT OF TRICK. THAT'S WHY WE NEED PHOTO  I.D.. HOW I DO KNOW SHE'S REALLY A  SEXY CRAYON? PLUS WE ARE NOW MORE  VULNERABLE TO FRAUD THAN  EVER. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND  ALERT. NATION, COURTS IS HAVE  ALREADY STRUCK DOWN VOTER  I.D. LAWS IN WISCONSIN,  SOUTH CAROLINA AND TEXAS AND THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN.
IF YOU ARE PENNSYLVANIA  VOTER YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO  SHOW A PHOTO I.D. THIS  ELECTION. A JUDGE RULED AGAINST THE  MEASURE FOR NOW SAYING HE  DIDN'T BELIEVE THERE WAS  ADEQUATE TIME FOR VOTERS TO EASILY GET A PHOTO I.D. BEFORE NOVEMBER 6th.
Stephen: THAT IS  RIDICULOUS. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR I.D.s  BY NOVEMBER 6th IF THEY GO  TO THE DMV NOW. BUT FOLKS, AS BAD AS THIS IS--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AS BAD AS THIS IS, THERE IS  A SILVER LINING TO THIS  STORY. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE  RULING, ELECTION OFFICIALS  CAN STILL ASK FOR PHOTO  I.D.s, THEY JUST CAN'T  PREVENT PEOPLE FROM VOTING IF THEY DON'T HAVE IT. THIS COULD STILL WORK. ASKING FOR THE I.D. IS NOW  MEANINGLESS BUT WE'RE STILL  ALLOWED THE CONSOLATION  PRIZE OF HARASSING VOTERS FOR NO REASON. AND IF WE JUST ADD SOME  OTHER INTIMIDATION TACTICS I  THINK WE CAN MAKE THE WRONG  KIND OF VOTERS SO  UNCOMFORTABLE, THEY'LL JUST TURN AROUND AND GO HOME. I SAY WE START WITH A CAVITY  SEARCH. YOU'RE FREE TO VOTE BUT  FIRST YOU HAVE TO LET US  PULL BACK YOUR CURTAIN AND  TAKE A FEW YANKS ON THAT  LEVER. AFTER THAT, AFTER THAT, WE  SIMPLY JUDGE THEIR OUTFIT. YOU'RE GOING WEAR THAT TO  VOTE? (LAUGHTER)  WHAT IS THAT, A SWEATER? NO, GOD, I CAN'T STOP FROM  YOU VOTING BUT I SHOULD STOP  YOU FROM DRESSING. (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, YOUR ASS IS  HUGE. DOES IT HAVE ITS OWN  CONGRESSMAN. NO, SERIOUSLY, GO VOTE, I'M  SURE IT WILL MAKE ALL THIS  BETTER. AND THEN TO ESCORT TO YOU  THE VOTING BOOTH, WE HAVE  YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND. SHE'LL BE SO HAPPY TO SEE  THAT YOU ARE FINALLY OUT OF  THE HOUSE AND DOING THINGS  BECAUSE SHE AND BRAD WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT YOU. BY THE WAY, THIS IS BRAD. YOU PROBABLY HAVE SEEN HIM  IN ALL THOSE COLOGNE ADS. OF COURSE HE ONLY DOES THOSE  TO PAY FOR HESS PENIS  REDUCTION THERAPY. IT HASN'T WORKED YET BUT  SHE'S PATIENT WITH HIS  PROGRESS. THEN YOU'RE FREE TO GO IN  THERE AND MAKE YOUR VOICE  HEARD. AND ON THE WAY OUT, YOU'LL  GET A STICKER THAT SAYS I  FARTHERED. WE'LL BE-- FARTED.
