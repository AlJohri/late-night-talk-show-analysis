[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY TBEFT TONIGHT IS AN M.I.T. PROFESSOR WHO BELIEVES THE  FUTURE OF EDUCATION IS ON THE  INTERNET. I CAN'T WAIT FOR BUZZ FEED'S TEN  BIGGEST LITERATURE FAILS. PLEASE WELCOME ANANT AGARWAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. HEY, HOW ARE YOU? A PROFESSOR. THANK SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
MY PLEASURE  Stephen: OUR A PROFESSOR OF  ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND  COMPUTER SCIENCE AT M.I.T. AND YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF ED-X. EXPLAIN TO THE GOOD PEOPLE WHAT  YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE  ED-X.
IT IS AN ON-LINE LEARNING  DESTINATION WHERE YOU CAN COME  IN, SIGN UP VERY QUICKLY AND TAKE FUN, HIP COURSES FROM SOME  OF THE BEST UNIVERSITIES IN THE  WORLD
Stephen: THE UNIVERSITY OF  FEEP ICKES HAS THAT. YOU CAN DO THAT. I'M SERIOUS. THEY ADVERTISE ON MY SHOW. RIGHT? THE SAME THING.
YOU CAN TAKE THESE GREAT  COURSES FROM UNIVERSITY OF LIKE  M.I.T., HARVARD
Stephen: I'VE HEARD OF THEM. WHAT DOES IT COST ME AGAIN?
IT'S FREE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE IN THE KNOWLEDGE  BUSINESS. I MEAN A UNIVERSITY. LET'S SAY I HAD A SHOE STORE AND  THEN I HIRED YOU TO WORK AT MY  SHOE STORE. YOU SAID, I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA. LET'S GIVE YOU THE SHOES AWAY  FOR FREE. I WOULD FIRE YOU AND THEN  PROBABLY THROW SHOES AT YOUR  HEAD. HOW CAN UNIVERSITIES SURVIVE IF  THEY'RE GIVING AWAY... WHY SEND  MIGUEL TO COLLEGE IF THEY'RE GIVING AWAY THE Ph.D.s FOR  FREE?
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO  IT. EDUCATION IS OUR CAUSE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE  AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ACCESS TO  A GREAT EDUCATION, MUCH LIKE THE AIR WE BREATHE. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING ACCESS  TO EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS ALL  OVER THE WORLD, UNIVERSITIES ARE DOING THIS SO THAT THEY CAN  BRING THE LEARNING BACK ON OUR  CAMPUSES
Stephen: HERE'S MY PROBLEM  WITH THIS NOW. AMERICA, THE SHINING CITY ON THE  HILL. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT? YEAH. ONE OF THE REASON IS IS THAT  PEOPLE COME TO AMERICA TO GET  THEIR EDUCATION. WE GET THE BEST OF THE BEST, THE  CREAM OF THE CROP. THEY COME OVER HERE BECAUSE THEY  DON'T HAVE TO COME HERE. ALL WE'RE GOING TO GET IS THE  PEOPLE COMING OVER HERE WHO ARE  DUMB.
(LAUGHING)  Stephen: WHY COME ANYMORE? (LAUGHING)  Stephen: WHY SHOULD THE BEST  COME TO AMERICA IF THEY DON'T  NEED THE EDUCATION.
EDUCATION IN AMERICA IS THE  ABSOLUTE BEST EDUCATION IN THE  WORLD
Stephen: DAMNED STRAIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO GIVE IT  AWAY
Stephen: WHAT? THE WORLD IS A MUCH SMALLER  PLACE TODAY. THERE'S A THING CALLED THE  INTERNET
Stephen: I'M FAMILIAR WITH  THAT. I HAD A LITTLE PIECE ABOUT IT  EARLIER IN THE SHOW.
(LAUGHING)  Stephen: IT OPENS THE WORLD  TO ALL KINDS OF THINGS THEY  HAVEN'T LEARNED ABOUT BEFORE.
IT'S BECOMING A SMALLER WORLD  BECAUSE OF THE ENTER. GIVING AWAY EDUCATION, THIS IS  GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE WORLD. AN EDUCATED WORLD IS A BETTER  WORLD FOR EVERYBODY. ARE CAMPUSES GOING TO GET  BETTER? ON-LINE LEARNING IS IS LIKE A  RISING TIDE THAT WILL LIFT ALL  BOATS ON CAMPUS OR ELSEWHERE. THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR  EVERYBODY
Stephen: YOU CAN SAY IT'S  GOOD. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S  GOOD. I GO TO AN ELITE UNIVERSITY. LET'S SAY I GO TO YOUR HARVARDS  OR YOUR M.I.T.s OR BERKELEYS,  I GET TO SAY I WENT TO HARVARD. THAT'S HALF OF WHAT YOU'RE  PAYING FOR. YOU WOULDN'T SAY I WENT TO  HARVARD. YOU WOULD SAY I WENT TO A SMALL  COLLEGE IN THE BOSTON AREA.
(LAUGHING)  Stephen: BUT AREN'T YOU  TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE  SPECIALNESS OF GOING TO COLLEGE?
I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY  CAREFUL TO DISTINGUISH CAMPUS  FROM ONLINE. MY COLLEAGUE SAID THERE'S CAMPUS  MAGIC. CAMPUS EDUCATION IS DIFFERENT  FROM ON-LINE EDUCATION. CAMPUS STUDENTS HAVE THINGS  LIKE, THEY INTERACT WITH EACH  OTHER. THEY LEARN THE RHETORIC. THEY HAVE DISCUSSIONS. WORK WITH PROFESSORS GET  INSPIRED BY PROFESSORS
Stephen: HOMO EROTIC FRAT  HAZING. ONLINE, NO ONE IS GOING TO ASK  YOU TO PASS A GREASE 45 RECORD  FROM BUTT CHEEK TO BUTT CHEEK BEFORE THEY'LL CALL YOU BROTHER.
OR $40,000  Stephen: EXACTLY. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ONLINE IN  THE ED-X RIGHT NOW?
ED-X DOT-ORG YOU CAN SIGN UP  VERY EASILY. WE HAVE OVER A MILLION STUDENTS  FROM EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW A MILLION  STUDENTS.
OVER A MILLION STUDENTS RIGHT  NOW FROM EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY IN  THE WORLD
Stephen: HOW DO YOU ASK  QUESTIONS?
THE WHOLE THING IS DONE  ONLINE. THIS GENERATION IS SO MUCH MORE  COMFORTABLE DOING EVERYTHING  ONLINE. WE HAVE DISCUSSION FORUMS THAT  ASK QUESTIONS ONLINE. THE AMAZING THING IS THAT IN  ADDITION TO PROFESSORS AND  TEACHING ASSISTANTS ANSWERING QUESTIONS, MUCH MORE THAN THAT,  THE LEARNING GOING ON WHERE THE  STUDENTS ARE ANSWERING EACH OTHER'S QUESTIONS. THEY'RE LEARNING BY TEACHING. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
Stephen: THEY'RE TEACHING  EACH OTHER?
YES  Stephen: EVENTUALLY THEY  WON'T NEED US.
I THINK WE CAN LEARN A LOT  FROM OUR STUDENTS.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE TEACHER. WE ARE ALL LEARNERS. WE'RE ALL TEACHERS. AND I THINK AS I SAY THAT, I  TELL THE STUDENTS THAT THERE  WILL COME A TIME VERY QUICKLY WHEN YOU WILL KNOW A LOT MORE  THAN ANY OF US DO. THAT'S WHEN YOU GET TO GRADUATE.
Stephen: WOW. ONCE YOU CAN SNATCH THE  KNOWLEDGE FROM MY HAND, GRASS  HOPPER. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME.
THANK YOU  Stephen: FROM ED-X. IT'S FREE. ANANT AGARWAL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
