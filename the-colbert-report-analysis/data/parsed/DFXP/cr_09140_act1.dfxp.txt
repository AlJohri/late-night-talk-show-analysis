Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ONIGHT SMALL TOWN  VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK. OH, NO, DID THAT FOOTLOOSE KID  START DANCING AGAIN? THEN IS THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO  GET INSIDE OUR HEADS? WHY ELSE WOULD THEY HAVE A  SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR? AND MY GUEST KEVIN SPACEY STARS  IN THE HOUSE OF CARDS AS A  SCHEMING CONGRESSMAN. I'LL ASKED HIM WHY HE SWITCHED  TO DOCUMENTARIES. IN BOSTON, MOBSTER WHITEY BULGER  HAS BEEN CONVICTED ON 31 COUNTS. HERE IN NEW YORK, TIGHTY WHITEY  BULGER CONTINUES HIS RUN FOR  MAYOR. THIS IS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, IN HERE, OUT THERE. LISTEN, AMERICA AND ALL THE  SHIPS AT SEA, FOLKS, IF YOU  WATCH THIS SHOW -- AND I HOPE YOU DO -- YOU KNOW THAT I AM A  PROUD SUPPORTER AND OCCASIONAL  SAVIOR OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS. IN 2010, THE COLBERT NATION  SPONSORED THE U.S. SPEEDSKATERS  WHO TOOK HOME THE GOLD BUT, FOLKS, I'M NO HERO. I'M THE GUY WHO FUNDED THE HERO  SO I'M MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE  HERO. BUT A NEW CRISIS MAY FORCE ME TO  DUST OFF MY RED, WHITE AND BLUE  NUTHUGGER. JIM?
THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN RUSSIA  ARE JUST ABOUT SIX MONTHS AWAY  AND THERE IS GROWING CONTROVERSY OVER NEW ANTIGAY LAWS AND ABOUT  THE SAFETY OF GAY PEOPLE  VISITING RUSSIA. ALSO GAY ATHLETES.
A RUSSIAN LAW UNANIMOUSLY  PASSED IN PARLIAMENT ALLOWS FOR  FINES AND ARRESTS OVER ANYTHING DEEMED GAY PROPAGANDA DISPLAYED  IN FRONT OF CHILDREN.
SO HOW WILL THIS BE ENFORCED? DOES THIS REALLY MEAN IF SOMEONE  WAS WAVING A RAINBOW FLAG OR  PEACEFULLY DEMONSTRATING OR TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT  THEIR LIFE THAT THEY COULD BE  ARRESTED? APPARENTLY YES.
Stephen: YES. RUSSIA WILL NOT TOLERATE THE  GAYS. NOW THIS MAKES SENSE, FOLKS,  BECAUSE THEIR PRESIDENT IS SO  DAMNED STRAIGHT. WHETHER HE'S SHIRTLESS HUNTING,  SHIRTLESS FISHING, SHIRTLESS  HORSEBACK RIDING OR TONGUING A 30-POUND CARP. BY THE WAY, THAT CARP HE WAS  TONGUING, FEMALE. OKAY. YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE SHE WAS  INTO IT. NOW THIS ANTIGAY LEGISLATION HAS  CAUSED OUTRAGE AND IN RESPONSE  THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE HAS BRAVELY STOOD UP  TO PUTIN AND SAID, "WHATEVER YOU  WANT, VLAD."  CITING ARTICLE 50 OF THE I.O.C. RULES WHICH STATES, "NO KIND OF  DEMONSTRATION OR POLITICAL,  RELIGIOUS OR RACIAL PROPAGANDA IS PERMITTED IN ANY OLYMPIC  SITES, VENUES OR OTHER AREAS."  ALL THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE IS SAYING IS THAT BEING GAY IS AN  ACT OF PROTEST BECAUSE WHAT ARE  GAY MEN DOING BUT BOYCOTTING  WOMEN? THEY'RE JUST... THE I.O.C. IS  JUST ASKING GAY ATHLETES TO  KNOCK IT OFF FOR A COUPLE OF  WEEKS. JUST LIKE AT THE '36 OLYMPIC  GAMES HITLER ASKED JESSE OWENS  TO EASE OFF ON THE BLACK. YOU KNOW, DON'T BE SO" OUT  THERE."  BUT TO BE SAFE, OKAY, I THINK  THEY SHOULD BRING THE OLYMPICS BACK TO ITS GREEK ROOTS WHEN  NOTHING GAY EVER HAPPENED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OKAY. I THINK HE HAD THAT GUY BY THE  GREEK ROOTS. AND FOLKS RUSSIA'S NOT THE ONLY  PLACE TRYING TO DEFEND ITS  FAMILY VALUES BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY AMERICA'S  TRADITIONAL SMALL TOWN MORALS  ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM WITHIN. WHEN IT COMES TO FIGHTING THE  GAY AGENDA, WE'VE ALREADY LOST  OUR BIG CITIES. THANKFULLY, AMERICA'S FAMILY  VALUES ARE KEPT ALIVE IN SMALL  TOWNS LIKE IN KENTUCKY IN THE HEART OF APPALACHIA I CAN'T.
ABOUT 335-340 PEOPLE. WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER.
EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER. WE'RE PRO GUN, HARD WORKING. COUNTRY PEOPLE. IT'S A FINE TOWN. Stephen: A FINE TOWN. BUT FOR HOW LONG? MEET THE MAYOR JOHNNY CUMMINGS. GO BACK. TOO FAR. GO BACK. A LITTLE MORE. GOOD.
HEY, I'M JOHNNY CUMMINGS. I'M THE MAYOR HERE. [BLEEP]
Stephen: AREN'T YOU  FORGETTING SOMETHING.
KENTUCKY. Stephen: NO, THE OTHER THING. I AM A GAY MAN. Stephen: A GAY MAN AND A GAY  MARE DESTROYING AMERICA. ... A GAY MAYOR DESTROYING  AMERICA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: AMERICANS COUNT ON  SMAWN TOWNS TO UPHOLD  TRADITIONAL MORALITY. BUT MAYOR CUMMINGS IS USING HIS  OFFICE TO IMPLEMENT THE GAY  AGENDA.
HE'S THE BEST ONE MAYOR WE'VE  HAD HERE IS HIM.
AS MAYOR OF THE CITY, HE'S  DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB.
HE'S CHANGED EVERYTHING. MADE THINGS BETTER.
Stephen: BETTER IF YOU MEAN  GAYER.
THE WORKERS WENT OUT IN THE  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND PATCHED  THE POTHOLES.
Stephen: GAY. PUT A NEW BRIDGE TO THE SEWER  PLANT.
Stephen: GAY. A FAMILY CENTER, A PARK, A  PLAYGROUND, STUFF FOR THE KIDS.
Stephen: GAY, GAY. HE HAS ADDRESSED THE WATER  SITUATION. IT'S BETTER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.
Stephen: BUT BETTER ISN'T GAY  ENOUGH FOR MAYOR CUMMINGS. LISTEN TO WHAT HE GAY-ED UP  NEXT.
I INTRODUCED THE FIREMAN'S  ORDINANCE.
Stephen: AND WHAT DOES HE  CONSIDER FAIR?
ONE COULD BE DENIED SERVICE  AND TERMINATED FROM THEIR JOB  ORE VINGTED FROM THEIR HOUSE JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL  PREFERENCE.
Stephen: NO ONE, NOT EVEN A  GAY GUY. BUT ONE BRAVE KENTUCKIAN KNOWS  WHAT FAIRNESS REALLY MEANS.
FAIRNESS IS NOTHING BUT A  TRICK WORD.
Stephen: LOCAL PASTOR TRUMAN  HURT IS BRINGING THE HURT TO THE  FAIRNESS ORDINANCE.
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIRE AND  DENY THEM SERVICE OR DENY THEM  HOUSING.
Stephen: BUT PASTOR HURT HAS  NOTHING AGAINST GAYS.
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST GAYS. I DON'T LIKE THEIR LIFESTYLE. I DON'T LIKE THEM TRYING TO PUSH  IT ON ME AND MY FAMILY. AND THE COMMUNITY.
Stephen: SO? THEY OUGHT TO GO BACK IN THE  CLOSET WHERE THEY BELONG.
Stephen: AND PASTOR HURT HAS  THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE CITY'S  SIMPLE HILL FOLK.
I'M IN FAVOR OF THE GAY  RIGHTS ORDINANCE.
Stephen: HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT  FROM THE CITY. WHO ELSE?
I THINK THE ORDINANCE IS A  GREAT THING.
Stephen: SHE'S A LESBIAN. WHAT ABOUT GARY? GARY, TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH  THE ORDINANCE.
I HAVE ONE THING AGAINST IT. NOT ONE THING.
Stephen: NOT ONE THING. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
THIS IS A SMALL TOWN. THEY THINK WE'RE A BUNCH OF  CLOSE MINDED HILL BILLIES.
Stephen: YES, WE COUNT ON  THAT AND THIS OPENLY GAY MAYOR  IS RUINING ALL OUR CLASSIC  STEREOTYPES.
I'M ALSO THE TOWN  HAIRDRESSER.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT ONE STICKS. BUT HOW HAS MAYOR CUMMINGS SO  QUICKLY DESTROYED THE VALUES OF  THE SALT OF THE ERLT IN-BRED YOLKALS IN THE ANSWER WILL SHOCK  YOU.
THERE IS A GAY MAFIA THAT HAS  INFLICTED THE FEAR OF DEATH. THEY HAVE THOSE WHO ARE, YOU  KNOW, THAT CLAIM TO BE FIGHTING  AGAINST BOEING BECOMING THE  BULLIES.
HOW CAN I BULLY, YOU KNOW,  HETEROSEXUAL COAL MINER INTO  DOING ANYTHING?
Stephen: HOW? GET THE LAW ON YOUR SIDE.
I KNOW HE'S GAY. YEAH, HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. YEAH, WE'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF  BEING LOVERS. A LOT OF THINGS THROUGHOUT THE  YEARS, HE'S BEEN THROUGH ALL  FOUR OF MY MARRIAGES. THAT BOY KNOWS MORE ABOUT ME  THAN MOST PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. I LOVE HIM LIKE A BROTHER. AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM JUST  LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE A BROTHER.
Stephen: THE FATE NOW LAY IN  THE HANDS OF ITS FRIGHTENING  COMMISSIONER CLAUDE BRANSON, JIMMY SLOAN, AND JOEL COTTON  COONS. HAS CUMMINGS GOTTEN TO THEM?
THE ORDINANCE PASSED EASILY 3  TO 1 WHICH MADE US THE SMALLEST  TOWN IN THE NATION TO PASS AN ORDINANCE LIKE THIS.
Stephen: MAYOR GAYER WON AND  SMALL TOWN AMERICA LOST.
HETEROSEXUAL MEN DISCUSSED  AND DEBATED AND PASSED THIS  ORDINANCE, IT MADE ME VERY PROUD TO BE A GAY MAN IN EASTERN  KENTUCKY.
Stephen: EXPLAIN YOURSELF ONE  OF THOSE FOUR HETEROSEXUAL MAN.
I DID VOTE FOR THE ORDINANCE. I DIDN'T SEE NO BIG DEAL IN IT.
Stephen: OH, NO. TELL HIM, PASTOR.
I'VE SEEN IT. IN SOME OF THE CITIES HOW THEY  COME IN AND JUST TAKE OVER ONE  PLACE AND THEN THEY SAY THAT'S A GAY BAR NOW.
Stephen: YES. THIS IS A GAY BAR NOW. WAIT. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GAY BARS?
I'VE BEEN TO A GAY BAR IN  DALLAS TEXAS.
Stephen: WAIT, WHAT? AND I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH  WHAT GOES ON IN A GAY BAR.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU DOING  IN A GAY BAR?
I WAS TT GAY BAR TO GET A  BEER. I JUST WALKED INTO THE PLACE. I WAS JUST MAKING...
Stephen: FRIENDS? MY ROUNDS. IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE A CASE  THAT SAID BEER.
Stephen: GAY BAR? THAT'S WHY I STOPPED. Stephen: TODAY IT'S THIS TOWN  BUT WHAT IF GAY TOLERANCE  SPREADS TO THE REST OF SMALL TOWN AMERICA?
IF GAY TOLERANCE SPREADS,  YES, IT WOULD HURT EVERYTHING IN  A BAD WAY.
I HAD FIVE OTHERS WHO CAME UP  AND THEY ALL SAID WE WANT TO BE  THE NEXT ONE. THAT WAS GREAT.
Stephen: GREAT IF YOU LIKE  SWIMMING IN A LAKE OF FIRE.
HOMOSEXUALS ARE SINNERS. WITHOUT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST  THEY'RE GOING TO HELL.
Stephen: SO JOHNNY CUMMINGS,  HAVE FUN AS MAYOR OF HELL. THAT'S SOMETHING THESE BACK  WOODS BIBLE THUMPERS CAN  UNDERSTAND.
GOD MAKES THEM BORN GAY, WHY  IS HE AGAINST IT? IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE. IF HE IS AGAINST IT, WHY DID HE  MAKE THEM BORN THAT WAY? I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. I'VE TRIED AND TRIED AND TRIED  TO UNDERSTAND THAT. I CAN'T. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
