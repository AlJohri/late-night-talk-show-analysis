(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WHAT A WONDERFUL EVENING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT A WONDERFUL EVENING TO BE HERE. COULDN'T THINK OF A  BETTER TIME, PLACE, OR PEOPLE TO TELL THE TRUTH TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH, NATION. NOW I DON'T KNOW-- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. IT'S A GREAT NIGHT. IF YOU WATCHED MY SHOW ON MONDAY NIGHT OR TRIED TO PRETEND YOU WEREN'T WATCHING IT AT WORK ON TUESDAY, THEN YOU KNOW THAT I AM TAKING MY SHOW DOWN TO WASHINGTON D.C. IT'S A ONE-NIGHT ONLY SPECIAL THIS MONDAY
STEPHEN COLBERT PRESENTS MR. COLBERT GOES TO WASHINGTON D.C. YA LATER LEGISLATOR. PARTISAN IS SUCH SWEET SORROW. A COLBERT VICTORY LAP 014. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS I'M GOING DOWN TO DC. I'M GOING TO SEE ALL THE SIGHTS. THE BIG TOOTH PICK, MEGALINCOLN AND OF COURSE THE POOL, WITH THAT HANDSOME MAN STARING OUT OF IT AND MY SHOW IS GOING TO BE A STAR-STUDDED EVENING BECAUSE I'M A STAR AND A STUD. BUT-- , BUT OF COURSE THE HIGHLIGHT IS THAT I LINED UP ONE OF MY FAVORITE 90s ALTERNATIVE BANDS, THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO PLAY THEIR HIT SONG PEACHES. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS A BIT OF A MIXUP AND I DID NOT BOOK THE BAND. I BOOKED THE ACTUAL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, BARACK OBAMA IS GOING TO BE MY GUEST. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OH YEAH. NATION, I CANNOT OVERSTATE HOW HUGE THIS IS. THE SIZE OF THE HUGENESS, LARGE. I AM SO HONORED TO BE SITTING DOWN WITH THE MAN WHO SAT DOWN WITH BILL O'REILLY. SO NATION, MARK YOUR CALENDARS. MONDAY DECEMBER 8th AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, TICKETS ARE ALREADY SOLD OUT. SO RESERVE A SEAT IN YOUR LIVING ROOM NOW. NATION, FOLKS, I COME TO YOU TONIGHT FROM A CITY GRIPPED BY FEAR. BECAUSE FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS NEW YORK HAS BEEN ENGULFED IN A HELL STORM OF PEACEFUL PROTEST. DEMONSTRATORS HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS HALTING NEW YORK TRAFFIC TO A LEVEL THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS NEW YORK TRAFFIC. AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE YESTERDAY A STATEN ISLAND GRAND JURY CHOSE NOT TO INDICT AN NYPD OFFICER WHO KILLED ERIC GARNER, AN UNARMED BLACK MAN. AND I HAVE TO ADMIT IT IS SHOCKING THAT ANYONE IN MANHATTAN HAS SHOWN AWARENESS OF STATEN ISLAND. FOLKS, FOLKS, THESE PROTESTORS AREN'T JUST AFTER THE NYPD. THEY ALSO TARGETED ANOTHER INSTITUTION.
PROTESTS BROKE OUT, BLOCKS AWAY FROM ROCKEFELLER CENTER LAST NIGHT WHERE THOUSANDS HAD GATHERED FOR THE ANNUAL TREE LIGHTING CHRISTMAS CEREMONY.
THEY'RE NOW CHANTING "SHUT IT DOWN, SHUT IT DOWN, ERIC GARNER, MICHAEL BROWN" THEY TRIED TO SHUT DOWN THE ROCKEFELLER CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTING.
THANK GOD IT WASN'T THE ROCKEFELLER MENORAH OR THIS PROTEST WOULD HAVE GONE ON FOR EIGHT MORE NIGHTS.
LOOK, FOLKS, I PEOPLE ARE ANGRY BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR ACTIVISTS TO TURN MIDTOWN SIDEWALKS INTO A CONGESTED WAR ZONE. THIS IS THE TIME FOR TOURISTS TO DO THAT. AND NATION--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I KNOW NEW YORK LOOKS TO ME FOR LEADERSHIP SO I'M CALLING FOR CALM. NOW SURE, YOU COULD VIEW YET ANOTHER NONINDICTMENT OF A WHITE POLICE FOR THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED BLACK MAN AS PART OF A LARGER TROUBLING TREND. OR YOU COULD BE FOX NEWS.
THE OFFICER IS WHITE. THE VICTIM WAS BLACK. AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THIS INCIDENT IS ALREADY, ALREADY DRAWING COMPARISONS TO THE SHOOTING DEATH OF MICHAEL BROWN IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI.
THERE IS A TENDENCY THAT THREE EXAMPLES CREATE A TREND.
STATISTICS DON'T SAY THERE IS A PATTERN.
THIS IS TO THE ABOUT RACE DISCRIMINATION AND I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE LUMPED TOGETHER WITH ANY OTHER TRENDS THAT ARE GOING ON.
WELL SAID. THIS IS NOT-- WE'RE ALL-- YES, I AGREE WITH YOU. I AM ANGRY AT THE IDEA THIS IS A TREND. IT IS NOT A TREND IT IS JUST A SERIES OF INCIDENTS THAT SHARE COMMON CHARACTERISTICS. FOR THIS TO IT BE AN OFFICIAL TREND, TAYLOR SWIFT WOULD HAVE TO KILL SOMEBODY AND TAY-TAY DON'T PLAY THAT WAY. OF COURSE LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THE LAST FEW MINUTES WILL KNOW THAT I BROKE THE STORY ABOUT RACIAL TENSION IN AMERICA. AT LEAST I ASSUME I DID. LIKE YOU, I GET ALL MY NEWS FROM "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE! DON'T LEAVE. BUT WE WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WATCHING ME BECAUSE THIS WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED HIS BEST TO ADDRESS IS THE ISSUE.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS PROPOSING A SERIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT REFORMS IN RESPONSE TO THE UNREST IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ASKING FOR 263 MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING OF POLICE OFFICERS AND OTHER RESOURCES.
I'M GOING TO BE PROPOSING SOME NEW COMMUNITY POLICING INITIATIVES THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND FUNDING AND TRAINING FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING UP TO 50,000 ADDITIONAL BODY-WORN CAMERAS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
Stephen: OH, GREAT TIMING, OBAMA. YOU SHOULD HAVE ANNOUNCED IT ON BLACK FRIDAY WHEN THOSE BODY CAMERAS WERE 2 FOR 1 AT KOHL'S BEFORE 6 A.M. TALK ABOUT TAX AND SPEND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE DEMOCRATS. NOW UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IDEA OF PUTTING THE CAMERAS ON THE COPS HAS SOME SUPPORT FROM CONFUSED CONSERVATIVES.
THE CAMERAS PROTECT HONEST COPS AS WELL AS DISCOURAGE POLICE ABUSE.
I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ON BODY CAMERAS. AT ONE TIME I THOUGHT THEY WERE A MISTAKE. NOW I BELIEVE THEY ARE A VERY GOOD IDEA.
I AM NOT SURPRISED GIULIANI CHANGED HIS MIND. HE IS IN FAVOR OF BEING ANYWHERE NEAR A CAMERA. AND THE WHOLE THING-- THE WHOLE THING IS BASED ON A FAULTY PREMISE. AS ONE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEF PUT IT WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE BEING WATCHED, YOU BEHAVE A LITTLE BETTER. THAT IS JUST HUMAN NATURE. OH, YEAH, THAT IS WHY THOSE REAL HOUSEWIFES ARE SO WELL BEHAVED. FOLKS-- I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, THIS THEORY IS CLEARLY BULL HOCKEY. AND I WILL PROVE IT RIGHT NOW. JIMMY, TURN OFF MY CAMERAS. GREAT, OKAY. CAMERA OFF. I'LL PROVE MY BEHAVIOR IS UNCHANGED. EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY, LITTLE COUGH. CAN I GET SOME WATER PLEASE, THANK YOU. CAN I GET SOME WATER.
HERE YOU GO, STEPHEN.
WHAT IS THIS, TAP WATER? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
OW!
READ YOUR CONTRACT. I TAKE MY WATER AT 54 DEGREES, TWIST OF LIME, NO EYE CONTACT.
NO, NOT THE SWORD.
TASTE MY BLADE, YOU CUR! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, HI, HI, IT'S JUST-- HOW TRAGIC. ANOTHER SENSELESS SUICIDE. TOO BAD THERE'S NO FOOTAGE. MAN, I AM STILL PARCHED. CAN I GET SOME (BLEEP) WATER? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. COME ON! WHERE IS IT?
