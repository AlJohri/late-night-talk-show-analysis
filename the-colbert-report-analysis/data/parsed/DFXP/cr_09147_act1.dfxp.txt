Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU, HEROES ALL. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING THE NEWS, YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EXCITING TIME IN NEW YORK CITY POLITICS. JUST YESTERDAY, VOTERS TURNED OUT TO NOMINATE REPLACEMENTS FOR OUTGOING MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG. SOMEONE'S GOT TO FILL THIS MAN'S SHOES, WHICH IS WHY I CAST MY VOTE FOR AN AMERICAN GIRL DOLL. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, IF YOU REMEMBER, LAST WEEK ON THIS VERY SHOW, I ENDORSED REPUBLICAN MAYORAL CANDIDATE JOE LHOTA BECAUSE AFTER TWO KITTENS STRANDED ON THE TRACKS FORCED THE SUBWAY LINE TO STOP SERVICE FOR SEVERAL HOURS, LHOTA WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WITH THE COURAGE TO COME OUT AS PRO CRUSHING KITTENS. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, NO SURPRISE, THAT CORE MESSAGE REZ 98ED.
A DECISIVE WIN LAST NIGHT FOR JOE LHOTA, THE FORMER M.T.A. CHAIRMAN BEATING OUT BILLIONAIRE JOHN CATSIMATIDIS TO WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATIONS FOR NEW YORK CITY MAYOR.
Stephen:  WOOO! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE CALL THE COLBERT BUMP, FOLKS, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE BUMP YOU FEEL WHEN YOUR SUBWAY CAR RUNS OVER KITTENS. ( LAUGHTER ) LHOTA NOW MOVES ON TO THE GENERAL ELECTION WHERE HE'S LIKELY FACING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE BILL DE BLASIO, A MAN SO LIBRY, HE WON THE GAY VOTE AGAINST A LESBIAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE-- ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, THAT'S JUST IN THE POLLS. AND BY DEFINITION, LESBIANS DON'T GO FOR POLLS. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, DEBLAWZIO, I BELIEVE-- AND I MEAN THIS, DE BLAWZIO MUST BE STOPPED. THIS MAD MAN WANTS TO RAISE TAXES ON THOAL MAKING MORE THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, COSTING GUYS LIKE ME ABOUT $973. $973? I'LL HAVE TO STOP BUYING NIGH YEARLY PAIR OF GUCCI PYROTECHNICON LOAFERS. HOW WILL I KNOW IT'S SPRING? EVEN WORSE, BEBLASIO TRICKED VOTERS BY RUNNING THIS HEARTWARMING AD FEATURING HIS BIRACIAL FAMILY, A CYNICAL STRATEGY THAT BLOOMBERG RIGHTLY CALLED RACIST. YES, WHAT IS MORE RACIST THAN FALLING IN LOVE WITH A BLACK WOMAN AND FATHERRERING A CHILD JUST SO YOU CAN CLAIM YOU'RE AGAINST STOP AND FRISK? ( LAUGHTER ) AND-- AND, FOLKS, FOR THE RECORD, I WOULD DEFINITELY FRISK THAT KID. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. HE COULD BE HIDING ANYTHING IN THAT 'FRO. DID WE LEARN NOTHING FROM THE 19 70'S HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER BIRACIAL PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY-- BARACK OBAMA. LAST NIGHT, OUR SO-CALLED COMMANDER IN CHIEF ATTACKED OUR TUESDAY NIGHT LINEUP TO TALK ABOUT SYRIA. WE HAD TO MISS "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT," JUST TO WATCH "AMERICA'S GOT SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS." ( LAUGHTER ) TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, OBAMA HIT BELOW THE BELT, IF YOU WEAR YOUR BELT RIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEART. JIM?
ASSAD'S GOVERNMENT GASSED TO DEATH OVER 1,000 PEOPLE, INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN.
Stephen:  NOW HE'S PLAYING THE DEATH CARD. THAT'S NOT FAIR. NO ONE CAN RESIST THAT, OTHER THAN JOE LHOTA. ( LAUGHTER ) I SAY-- I SAY, FOLKS, I SAY, IF OBAMA REALLIMENTED TO SELL US SYRIA, HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A PAGE FROM THE PEOPLE SELLING US SIRI BECAUSE PUSHING THE IPHONE AND A WAR ARE A LOT ALIKE-- YOU JUST SAY THAT THE NEW ONE IS SMALLER, FASTER, AND CHEAPER, AND PEOPLE WILL BUY IT, EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE LSHED GOT ONE AND THEY'RE STILL PAYING OFF THE PREVIOUS MODEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE iPHONE 5S. DESPITE THE MEDICINE'S SPEECH WAS MOOT ON, ARRIVAL THANKS TO JOHN KERRY.
IS THERE ASKING AT THIS POINT HIS GOVERNMENT COULD DO OR OFFER THAT WOULD STOP AN ATTACK?
SURE, HE COULD TURN OVER EVERY SINGLE BIT OF HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE NEXT WEEK, BUT HE ISN'T ABOUT TO DO IT AND IT CAN'T BE DONE, OBVIOUSLY.
Stephen:  BUT REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING-- YOU CAN'T SELL "CAN'T" WITHOUT "CAN."
RUSSIA SAY REAL GAME PLAN IN WHAT SOME CONSIDERED A GAFFE, ENCOURAGING SYRIA TO TAKE ACTION SAYING WE'RE CALLING ON THE SYRIAN AUTHORITIES TO NOT ONLY PUT WEAPONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONTROL BUT ALSO FOR ITS FURTHER DESTRUCTION.
THIS MORNING SYRIA SAID IT ACCEPTED THE RUSSIAN PROPOSAL TO PLACE CHEMICAL WEAPONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONTROL.
Stephen:  OH, MY GOSH, THAT IS SO EMBARRASSING. THE RUSSIANS OUTMANEUVERED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IT'S LIKE WE'RE PLAYING CHECKERS, AND PUTIN IS PLAYING SHIRTLESS CHESS. ( LAUGHTER ) ON HORSE. UN THAT'S NOT EASY. WELL, FOLKS, THERE IT IS. CRISIS AVERTED. NOW, CONGRESS SUSPENDS ITS VETE ON A MILITARY STRIKE, THE U.N. SECURES ASSAD'S CHEMICALS STOCKPILES, AND THE SYRIAN PEOPLE CAN GO BACK TO BOOING KILLED WITH CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS. EVERYBODY WEBZ. OF COURSE THAT'S JUST MY ANALYSIS. FOR MORE LET'S GET THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE FROM SENATOR RAND PAUL WHO MADE THE ROUNDS ON THE CABLE NEWS SHOWS LAST NIGHT AFTER FIRST DELIVERING THE TRADITIONAL "STATE OF THE RAND" SPEECH. PAUL HAS BEEN OPPOSED TO MILITARY ACTION IN THE BEGINNING AND WAS THRILLED BY RUSSIA'S DIPLOMATIC PROPOSAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO TRUST THE PROPOSAL OR NOT. THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY SERIOUS? CAN WE TRUST THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PLAN?
Stephen:  RIGHT, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS TRUST. FOR INSTANCE, THAT THING ON YOUR HEAD, YOU ASSURE US IT'S HAIR BUT I HAVE YET TO BE CONVINCED IT'S NOT A SLUM BERG WOMBAT READY TO STRIKE IT'S ANY TIME. I AGREE WITH RAND PAUL-- WE CANNOT TRUST RUSSIA OR SYRIA. WE SHIPMENT DO ANYTHING.
THE VIOLATION OF EVERY NORM FOR SOMEONE TO KILL CIVILIANS, AND I THINK ASSAD SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE.
Stephen:  ABSOLUTE, GOT TO HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE, OTHERWISE, WHAT ARE WE AS AINATION, NOT-HOLD-ACCOUNTABLE-STAN. I AGREE WITH RAND PAUL-- NO, JIM ESH THE SECOND RAND PAUL, OKAY. WE MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN OF LIMITED STRIKES, SEND A MESSAGE.
THEY HAVE SAID THE WAR WILL BE UNBELIEVABLY SMALL AND LIMITED. TO ME THAT SOUND LIKE THEY ARE PREANNOUNCING THAT THE MILITARY STRIKES WILL NOT PUNISH ASSAD IMPORTANTLY OR EFFECT REGIME CHANGE.
I THINK ASSAD DESERVES DEATH FOR THIS.
REGIME CHANGE, SHOCK AND AWE, BOMBS AWAY.
FING WE BOMB ASSAD IT WILL BE MORE LIKELY THE COUNTRIES BECOMESES MORE UNSTABLE.
Stephen:  I WAS WRONG. THIS IS THE RAND PAUL I AGREE WITH BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT-- IF WE TAKE UP ON THE THE GUY WHO GASES CHILDREN, SOMEBODY BAD MIGHT TAKE OVER. SO JUST TO RECAP-- RAND PAUL SAYS NO DIPLOMACY, CAN'T DO NOTHING, BUT NO TO THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, AND NO TO REGIME CHANGE. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, TAKEN ALL TOGETHER THAT'S REALLY... CALM YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT SURE HOW I WOULD DESCRIBE RAND PAUL'S RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW WHAT, RAND PAUL, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE RAND PAUL?
I THINK HE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT HERE AIR, LITTLE BIT THERE, AND A LITTLE BIT EVERYWHERE. I DON'T THINK HE MAKES ANY SENSE.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT BETTER YOURSELF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
