( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS THE  COFOUNDER OF APPLE COMPUTERS. IT'S A LOT LIKE THE BILL GATES  BIOPICK, BUT SLEEKER AND TWICE  THE PRICE. PLEASE WELCOME ARCHTON KUTCHER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ASHTON, HEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW  LAST NIGHT.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen:  YOU'RE AN  IMPRESSIVE GUY, OKAY. ACTOR, PRODUCER. YOU'RE A BIT OF A TECH  ENTREPRENEUR. YOU HELP FUND SPODDIFY, AIR B &  B, AND IN 2009 BECAME THE FIRST  TWITTER USER TO HIT ONE MILLION  FOLLOWERS. IS THAT--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOW YOU'RE PLAYING STEVE JOBS IN  THE "BIOPICK JOBS," OPENS AUGUST  16. HOW-- ARE YOU A FAN OF JOBS? DID YOU COME AT THIS AS A SUPER  FAN OF A TECH GENIUS?
I CAME AS A ADMIRER OF HIS  WORK, AND I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS  IN THE TECH INDUSTRY THAT KNEW HIM AND LOVED HIM AND WORKED FOR  HIM, WERE BERATED BY HIM, BUT  FELT HE DEFINITELY MADE THEM  BETTER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  THAT BERATED  THING I LIKE.
YEAH.
Stephen:  THAT INSPIRES  PEOPLE.
YES, IT DOES. I KIND OF THINK HE WAS LIKE A  GREAT FOOTBALL COACH. I HAD A FOOTBALL COACH IN HIGH  SCHOOL, HE WAS ALSO MY UNCLE,  WHICH WAS A LITTLE WEIRD-- ( LAUGHTER )  HE USED TO ABUSE ME VERBALLY,  CONSISTENTLY, CONSTANTLY --
Stephen:  NAIK NAME? DID HE CALL YOU A NICKNAME?
( BLEEP ).
Stephen:  SO THAT'S  ENDEARING, ( BLEEP )?
WHEN HE WANTED TO BE KIND. HE REALLY PUSHED ME, AND I THINK  HE MADE ME BETTER. AND I THINK PEOPLE THAT HAD THE  CAPABILITY TO TAKE STEVE JOBS'  BRUTAL HONESTY, HE MADE THEM  BETTER.
Stephen:  OKAY, WE HAVE A  LITTLE CLIP OF THE MOVIE HERE. JIMMY, CAN YOU SHOW THAT?
YOUR BIG BALD BRAIN WANTED  SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T EXIST, SO  YOU JUST WILLED IT INTO  EXISTENCE.
WHAT DO YOU CALL THE SYSTEM,  THE OPERATING SYSTEM.
OPERATING SYSTEM.
IT'S A REALTIME DISPLAY OF  CURRENT OPERATIONS.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE  WORKING ON WHILE YOU'RE WORKING  ON IT.
OKAY.
THIS IS FREEDOM. THIS IS FREEDOM TO CREATE AND TO  DO AND TO BUILD AND-- AND  ARTISTS, INDIVIDUALS.
LOOK, YOU'RE OVER-REACTING. EVEN IF YOU WERE DEVELOPING THIS  FOR FREAKS LIKE US-- AND I DOUBT  ARE YOU-- NOBODY WANTS TO BUY A COMPUTER, NOBODY!
HOW DOES SOMEBODY KNOW WHAT  THEY WANT IF THEY'VE NEVER SEEN  SEEN IT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  DID YOU HAVE TO  LIKE HIM TO DO THIS PART? BECAUSE I HEAR-- I'M NOT AN  ACTOR, BUT I HEAR THAT ACTORS  HAVE TO FIND A LITTLE BIT OF THEMSELVES IN THE PERSON THAT  THEY'RE PORTRAYING. ( LAUGHTER )  AND IF HE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A  DICK, DID YOU HAVE TO FIND A  LITTLE DICK IN YOU?
WELL, YOU CAN'T JUDGE YOUR  CHARACTER. UN, YOU KNOW, STEVE JOBS, EVEN  THOUGH HE WAS LIKE A LUMINARY  AND THIS BRILLIANT GENIUS, HE WAS ALSO A PERSON AND HE HAD  FLAWS AND HE HAD SCARS AND HE. PERSONAL WOUNDS. WHEN HE WAS A KID HE WAS  ADOPTED. AND I THINK WHEN HE FOUND OUT,  HE FELT VERY REJECTED BY HIS  BIRTH PARENTS. AND THEN HE WAS REJECTED BY THE  VERY COMPANY THAT HE CREATED  WHEN APPLE FIRED HIM. SO I THINK THE WAY THAT HE  SOUGHT LOVE AND APPRECIATION WAS  THROUGH THE PRODUCTS THAT HE  BUILT. AND I THINK THAT HE WAS SUCH A  PERFECTIONIST AND SO DRIVEN TO  ACTUALLY MAKE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE LOVED AND APPRECIATED AND  MAKE THE CONSUMERS HAPPY, THAT  THE WAY HE RECEIVED LOVE, IF THEY LOVED THE PRODUCT, IT MEANT  THAT THEY LOVED HIM. AND TO ME, ONCE I FOUND THAT  CHORD IN THE CHARACTER, I WAS  ABLE TO SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM BEING AIBILITY OF A DICK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  HIS EMOTIONAL  STATE COULD HAVE BEEN PEG TO THE  STOCK PRICE. IF THE COMPANY WAS DOING WELL,  HE WAS DOING WELL?
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE OTHER  THING THAT MADE HIM EXTREMELY  INNOVATIVE. HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE DIDN'T  HAVE TO BE BEHOLDEN TO THE  STOCKHOLDERS. IF HE BUILT A COMPANY AND BUILT  INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT  CONSUMERS LOVED AND APPRECIATED AND HE DID IT INTELLIGENT  INTELTLY BY VERTICALLY  INTEGRATING ALL THE HARDWARE OF APPLE WITH THE iPOD AND  IPHONE AND THOSE THINGS, I  THINK WHAT HE UNDERSTOOD IS IF HE MADE A GREAT PRODUCT THAT  PEOPLE LOVE, THAT THE EFFECTIVE  THAT WOULD BE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAPPY STOCKHOLDERS.
Stephen:  WOW. YOU'RE THROWING ME OFF A LITTLE  BIT HERE. ( LAUGHTER )  NO OFFENSE, NO OFFENSE. OKAY. BUT YOU'RE KNOWN FOR PLAYING NOT  THE SMARTEST CHARACTER. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  OKAY? YOU'RE COMING OFF AS SMART RIGHT  NOW. YOU'RE COMING OFF AS SMART.
I CAN BRING THIS ALL BACK. I CAN BRING IT ALL BACK.
Stephen:  YOU'RE PLAYING,  LIKE, THIS GENIUS, AND FROM WHAT  I UNDERSTAND FROM THAT DOCUMENTARY I SAW, YOU CAN'T  FIND YOUR CAR. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  DID YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO  TALK TO JOBS HIMSELF? DID YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO  MEET HIM?
BECAUSE I WORK WITH A LOT OF  YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS THAT ARE  DEVELOPERS BUILDING ON APPLE'S PLATFORM FOR A LONG TIME, I GOT  INVITED TO GO TO THEIR WORLDWIDE  DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE TO MEET STEVE BUT I WAS WORKING ON "TWO  AND A HALF MEN" THAT DAY AND I  COULDN'T GO. I THINK WHEN HE PASSED AWAY, I  REALIZED THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO  MEET THE LEONARDO DA VINCI OF OUR DAY, A GUY WHO WAS A TRUE  ARTIST AND TRUE INVENTOR AND  INNOVATOR, AND I MISSED IT. SO WHEN I READ THIS SCRIPT, I  THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT  OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW A MAN THAT ADMIRED.   ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELL, ARTON, GOOD  LUCK. THE MOVIE IS "JOBS" AUGUST
