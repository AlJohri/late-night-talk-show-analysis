WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, LAST NIGHT WAS MUSIC'S BIGGEST EVENT OF THE YEAR, THE GRAMMYS. OF COURSE, BIG WINNERS OF THE NIGHT WERE MACKLEMORE AND RYAN LEWIS WHO WON FOUR GRAMMYS INCLUDING BEST RAP ALBUM, WHICH MEANS THAT WHITE PEOPLE HAVE OFFICIALLY WON RAP, THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR RAP, AFRICAN-AMERICANS. YOU FOUGHT BRAVELY, BUT WE'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE. (LAUGHTER) NOW UNFORTUNATELY, UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THE EVENING WAS MARRED WHEN MY FRIEND MACKLEMORE AND LEWIS HAD TO POLITICIZE THEIR GAY ANTHEM SAME LOVE.
IT'S THE SAME LOVE ♪ ♪ ABOUT TIME THAT WE RAISE UP ♪ ♪.
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TO CELEBRATE LOVE AND HARMONY IN EVERY COLOR. AS I LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE THE FACES OF 33 COUPLES WHO HAVE CHOSEN THIS MOMENT TO CELEBRATE THEIR VOWS WITH US HERE IN LOS ANGELES. BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU A MARRIED COUPLE!
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW BUT, BUT MADONNA'S ENTRANCE GAVE ME AN URGE TO EAT A BUCKET OF FRIED CHICKEN. I CAN'T BELIEVE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EITHER THAT OR SHE HAD A DOLLY PARTON TRANSPLANT. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION THEY HELD A MASS GAY WEDDING. NOW OFFICIALLY, OFFICIALLY IT WAS ONLY 33 COUPLES BUT WHO KNOWS HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE INADVERTENTLY GAY MARRIED LAST NIGHT. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST LIKE A GALAGHER CONCERT, THE FIRST TWO ROWS ARE IN THE GAY SPLASH ZONE. WELL, I HOPE, I HOPE THAT DAVE GROHL AND JAY Z WILL BE REALLY HAPPY BUT IT MIGHT BE TOUGH ON BEYONCE AND HER NOW SPOUSE TAYLOR SWIFT. DO NOT BREAK HER HEART OR SHE WILL WRITE A VERY CATTY SONG ABOUT YOU. OTHER BIG WINNERS LAST NIGHT INCLUDE ALICIA KEYS, PAUL McCARTNEY, DAVE GROHL, MIKE BUBLE, VAMPIRE WEEKEND AND DAFT PUNK. WHAT DO ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE IN COMMON? OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I GAVE THEM ALL THE COLBERT BUMP. I'M A STAR MAKER, BABY, I'M A GRAMMY FACTORY, THIS IS WHERE IT COMES FROM. BUT NATION, AS PROUD AS I AM OF ALL THESE FRIENDS OF THE SHOW I AM MOST PROUD OF MY BEST FRIEND OF THE SHOW, ME. FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD ALBUM, STEPHEN COLBERT. CAROL BURNETT, DAVID SEDARIS, BILLY CRYSTAL, PETE SEEGER.
I EVEN KNOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO STEPHEN COLBERT!
WHOOO! AMERICA AGAIN! I WON A GRAMMY FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD. STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WIN, WIN THE GRAMMY FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD, THAT IS LIKE THE NOBEL PRIZE OF AUDIO BOOKS. (LAUGHTER) AND WINNING A GRAMMY FOR JUST SPEAKING IS NOT EASY. THAT'S LIKE BEING THE WINNING CONTESTANT ON SO YOU THINK YOU CAN WALK. NOW OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY WINNING BEST SPOKEN WORD MEANS I'M THE WORLD'S GREATEST WORD SPEAKER. I MEAN LOOK HOW I SAY IT, WATCH THIS, LISTEN UP, AMELIORATE, YOLO, ALL WORDS AND I JUST NAILED THEM. I'M SO GOOD AT SPEAKING WORDS, I'M SO GOOD AT SPEAKING WORDS I SHOULD GET PAID JUST FOR SPEAKING WORDS. WHAT'S THAT? I DO? AND VERY WELL? OH, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. AND FOLKS, WITH THIS, WITH THIS MY SECOND GRAMMY THAT MEANS I FINALLY COLLECTED THE COVETED EGOT, THE BIGGEST AWARDS IN ENTERTAINMENT, EMMY, GRAMMY, OTHER GRAMMY AND THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE AWARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW THE ACADEMY OF RECORDING ARTS AND SCIENCES IS VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT HOW YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HOLD THESE THINGS. ALWAYS WITH A GRAMOPHONE TURNED TO THE LEFT SIDE OF PICTURE, OKAY. ONLY THIS SIDESHOWING, OKAY THIS SIDESHOWING, WHY? PARTLY BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE PLAQUE IS AND YOU CAN SEE WITH MY PREVIOUS GRAMMY FOUR YEARS AGO, BUT ALSO BECAUSE-- ALSO BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE HAS VISIBLE GENITALIA. NOW I DON'T--  (APPLAUSE) I DONE-- I'M GOT TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO THAT. I ASSUME THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE MORE GRAMMYS. HOLD ON, I KNOW WHAT TO DO, HOLD ON ONE SECOND. THERE YOU GO. HOLD ON, HOLD ON. THAT'S BETTER.
