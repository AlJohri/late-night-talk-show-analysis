[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: HEY, WAIT HERE. I DIDN'T KNOW. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF  INSANE THINGS IN MY DAY. AFTER ALL, I'VE INTERVIEWED  JAMES CARVILLE. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, EVERY NOW AND THEN  SOMETHING REALLY WILD LEAPS OUT  AT YOU-- AGAIN, JAMES CARVILLE. [ LAUGHTER ] ONCE HE'S COILED, HE HAS TO  STRIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHEN SOMETHING TRULY UNUSUAL  COMES ALONG, I DROP EVERYTHING  TO TELL AMERICA ABOUT THE CRAZIEST (bleep) THING I'VE EVER  HEARD. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, HUMANS ARE FAR MORE  PRODUCTIVE THAN ANYTHING IN THE  ANIMAL KINGDOM. TRUST ME, I SPEND MY ENTIRE  WORK-DAY WATCHING. KITTENS ON YOUTUBE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY GET NOTHING DONE. NO, YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T GET NOTHING DONE. YOU ARE SO SLEEPY. [ LAUGHTER ] [BABBLING] BUT NEW RESEARCH MAY FORCE US TO  EAT CROW, THANKS TO AN OXFORD  UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CROWS USING  TOOLS. WATCH THIS. AS THIS CROW WHO, WITHOUT ANY  TRAINING, USES A SMALL TOOL TO  GET AT A SLIGHTLY LONGER TOOL, THEN USES THE LONGER TOOL TO GET  A TREAT. THIS IS INSANE! [ LAUGHTER ] A BIRD SHOWING HIGHER-LEVEL  THINKING! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS AND BIG  BIRD STILL NEEDS HELP COUNTING  TO TEN! [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS AN AMAZING FEAT. IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH TO SEE ON  THAT VIDEO, SO LET ME SHOW YOU  JUST HOW CLEVER THAT CROW WAS. THIS IS BASICALLY THE EXPERIMENT  GOING ON. THERE'S FOOD AT THE END OF THIS  TUBE. THERE'S A PEANUT M & M DOWN  THERE. REPRESENTS THE TREAT DOWN THERE  THE OTHER TOOLS OF VARIOUS  LENGTHS HAVE TOOLS OF VARIOUS LENGTHS IN THEM. IN ORDER TO GET THE FOOD, WHAT  YOU DO IS -- YOU TRY TO GET YOUR  FINGER IN THERE. GET THAT OUT OF THERE  WHEN DID MY FINGERS GET SO FAT? [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IF -- [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WAIT A SECOND. YOU GOTTA USE THE TOOLS. GIVE ME THOSE (bleep) THINGS  SNSM COULD YOU -- FORGET IT. I DON'T NEED IT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AHHH. MMMMM. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, I'VE WATCHED SHERYL CROW  FROM A CROW'S NEST. WHILE DRINKING OLD CROW TO  FORGET ABOUT MY CROW'S FEET. BUT A CROW USING TOOLS? THAT'S THE CRAZIEST (bleep)  THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
