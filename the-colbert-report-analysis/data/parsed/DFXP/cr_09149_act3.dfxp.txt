WELCOME BACK.
RESULTING AND HE THINKS THAT'S A BAD THING. PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW BACEVICH. WRING THANK YOU FOR COMING ON, GOOD TO SEE YOU, WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
FOR PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN BOSTON UNIVERSITY, VIETNAM VET, 23 YEARS 6 MILITARY SERVICE, RETIRED ARMY CONTINENTAL EL AND A NEW BOOK CALLED BREACH OF TRUST. HOW AMERICANS FAILED THEIR SOLDIERS AND THEIR COUNTRY. ALL RIGHT, THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT IN FAVOR OF MILITARY INTERVENTION IN OTHER COUNTRIES TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS BY THE UNITED STATES.
I'M IN FAVOR OF MILITARY INTERVENTION WHERE IT MAKES SENSE.
Stephen: SYRIA.
NO.
Stephen: LET'S BRING THOSE PEOPLE TO THE BOOM-BOOM ROOM. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, IF WE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, I'M NOT SURE THAT DUMPING MISSILES ON DAMASCUS IS GOING TO DO MUCH TO ALLEVIATED-- .
Stephen: TARGETED STRIKE, SMART BOMB.
THE PEOPLE SUFFERING ARE IN REFUGEE CAMPS.
Stephen: DON'T BOMB THE REFUGEE CAMPS.
I'M WITH YOU.
Stephen: I WILL GO OUT ON A LIMB AND SAY THAT. BUT YOU'VE GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT YOU DONE THINK, TELL ME IF I GET THIS WRONG, THAT ANY MILITARY INTERVENTION BY AMERICA OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS HAS BEEN WORTHWHILE, THAT THEY'VE BEEN A WASTE.
BY AND LARGE, IF WE THINK ABOUT THE WAR FOR THE MIDDLE EAST, WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN A WAR WITH THE MIDDLE EAST FOR 30 YEARS.
Stephen: THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE VET NAM, VIETNAM WAS WORTH IT.
NO, THAT WAS ALSO A WAISMTS I WAS THERE.
Stephen: YOU WERE THERE, OKAY.
BUT MORE RECENTLY OUR EFFORTS TO USE OUR POWER TO STABILIZE THE REGIONS, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE REGION, TO MAKE THE PEOPLE IN THE REGION LOVE US, IT AIN'T WORKED. AND SO TO IMAGINE THAT OPENING UP A NEW FRONT ON THIS WAR IN SYRIA, AND YOU'RE-- TO THINK YOU'LL GET A DIFFERENT OUTCOME, I JUST DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: BUT DO WE WANT THEM TO LOVE US. DON'T WE ALSO WANT THEM TO FEAR US BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL RESPECT US.
THESE ARE COUNTRIES FULL OF, BAD MEN, DOING BAD THINGS, DON'T WE, YOU KNOW, ISN'T OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SEND IN MILITARY FORCE WITH THE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW?
WELL, IF OUR EFFORTS ACTUALLY CAUSE THEM TO RESPECT US OR EVEN TO FEAR US, THEN YOU COULD ARGUE THAT MAYBE WHAT MAKES SENSE BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN THE OUTCOME. YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE PEOPLE WE ARE SENDING IN, THAT IS TO SAY OUR SOLDIERS PAY A HORRIFIC COST FOR THE WARS THAT WASHINGTON DECIDES WE MUST FIGHT, 1 PERCENT BEARS THE BURDEN OF SERVICE AND SACRIFICE. 99% OF THE REST OF US WATCH WHETHER THAT IS DEMOCRATIC, WHETHER THAT IS MORAL.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK OUR PRESENT MILITARY SYSTEM IS DEMOCRATIC.
I THINK IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC.
IF OUR MILITARY SYSTEM IS UNDEMOCRATIC, MY, YOU KNOW, MY INSTINCT IS TO HAVE OUR MILITARY INVADE OUR MILITARY SYSTEM TO BRING DEMOCRACY HERE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK THE ANSWER IS TO HAVE THE PEOPLE IN-- TO BRING DEM OCTOBER TEE-- DEMOCRACY TO OUR MILITARY SYSTEM.
Stephen: ARE NEW FAVOR OF A DRAFT.
I'M IN FAVOR OF EVERY 18-YEAR-OLD SHOULD OWE SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY, THE COMMUNITY, SOME SERVE IN THE MILITARY, OTHER SERVE IN OTHER CAPACITY.
Stephen: OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT JUST CLAPPED, HOW MANY OF YOU ARE 18? HA, HA, HA. YEAH. YAY! MAKE THEM GO. OKAY. BUT THE PEOPLE WOULD FREAK OUT, RIGHT. IF YOU DID THAT, IF YOU INTRODUCED LEGISLATION SAYING AMERICANS MUST DO X, Y OR Z, DON'T YOU THINK ME AND MY BUDDIES IN THE TEA PARTY ARE GOING TO SAY GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE AND THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT ARE GOING TO SAY BUT THEY NEED TO DO THE COMMUNITY SERVICE TO GET THEM INTO COLLEGE. I MEAN --
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH SELL. THE WAY TO MAKE THE SALE IS TO PERSUADE PEOPLE THAT OUR CURRENT DEFINITION OF CITIZENSHIP IS INSIP I HAD, IT'S THIN. I AM OWED PREROGATIVE, I HAVE NO OBLIGATION. WE NEED TO MOVE TO A CONCEPTION OF CITIZENSHIP THAT PROVIDES PREROGATIVES, PRIVILEGES BUT ALSO ENTABLES OBLIGATION.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT YOU CALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TYPES, WHAT DOW MEAN, PEOPLE COME AND SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. BY THE WAY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. (LAUGHTER) AND I KNOW YOU MEAN IT.
UH-HUH. BUT I THINK THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE ASKED, WHAT DOES THANKING SOLDIERS FOR THEIR SERVICE ENTAIL ON THE PART OF THE REST OF US? AND IT OUGHT TO ENTAIL SOMETHING MORE THAN SIMPLY SAYING THANKS OR PUTTING A BUMPER STICKER ON YOUR CAR.
BETTER YOU THAN ME.
WELL, I THINK TO SOME DEGREE THAT'S THE IMPLICATION, THE UNSPOKEN IMPLICATION, BETTER YOU THAN ME. BUT IT OUGHT TO BE US. THE ARMY OUGHT TO BE THE PEOPLE'S ARMY. WE SHOULD REINSTITUTE A TRADITION OF CITIZEN SOLDIERS.
Stephen: BUT IF EVERYONE WOULD GO INTO THE ARMY, I THINK WE WOULD DO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND NOT SEND KIDS OFF TO WARS.
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MR. BACEVICH, ANDREW BACEVICH, BREACH OF TRUST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
