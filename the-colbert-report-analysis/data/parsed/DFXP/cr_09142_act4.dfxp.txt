NOW, BEFORE WE SAY GOOD NIGHT, I  WOULD LIKE TO SAY HELLO TO THE  NEWEST MEMBER OF THE COLBERT NATION, LITTLE EMEESA MAC ROSTA,  DAUGHTER OF MY CRACK RESEARCHER  JEN ROSTA. NOW, JEN, I'VE BEEN DOING SOME  BABY RESEARCH FOR YOU ON YAHOO  ANSWERS. NOW, DID YOU KNOW IT HELPS THE  BONDING PROCESS IF THE ENTIRE  FAMILY SLEEPS IN THE CHILD'S  CRIB? AND THAT A BABY CAN GET ALL ITS  REQUIRED NUTRIENTS FROM A  WENDY'S FROSTY? IT'S TRUE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S YAHOO-TRUE. OF COURSE, THE BEST WAY TO  ENSURE A CHILD'S HEALTH IS FOR  THE MOTHER TO RETURN TO WORK  IMMEDIATELY. PLEASE, JEN, I DON'T KNOW  ANYTHING WITHOUT YOU. GOOD NIGHT.
