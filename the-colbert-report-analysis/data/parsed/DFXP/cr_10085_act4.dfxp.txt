Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. IN JUST A FEW SHORT MOMENTS,  THIS BROADCAST WILL END, AND  THEN WHAT WILL YOU DO? TALK TO YOUR KIDS? IT'S MIDNIGHT. WHY ARE YOUR KIDS STILL UP? YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PARENT. LUCKILY THERE'S A NEW WAY TO  NEVER BE WITHOUT MY SHOW. JUST DOWNLOAD THE NEW  OFFICIAL APP WHICH  WORKS ON iPAD, iPHONE,  AND FOR SOME REASON, THE 2003  MOTOROLA RAZOR. WITH THE APP, YOU CAN WATCH  EVERYTHING THIS NETWORK HAS TO  OFFER FROM THE LATEST EPISODES  OF "COLBERT REPORT" TO  ARCHIVED EPISODES OF THE  "COLBERT REPORT", PLUS YOU CAN  CATCH UP ON OTHER GREAT  PROGRAMS LIKE SOUTHERN PARK,  HASHTAG TWELVE O' CLOCK, WORKPLACE COMEDY. FUTURE SIMPSONS, AND OF  COURSE, THE JOHN DALY SHOW. IT'S A GREAT APP, AND I'D LIKE  TO BE CLEAR, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY  NO CONTROL OVER WHAT GOES ON  IT.  SO GET YOUR COPY WHEREVER  FREE APPS ARE SOLD. GOODNIGHT. [APPLAUSE]     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  Captioned by     Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
