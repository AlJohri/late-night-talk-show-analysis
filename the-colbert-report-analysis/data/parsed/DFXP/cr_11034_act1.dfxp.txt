(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH! COME ON! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU'RE THE HEROS! YOU'RE THE IT-GETTERS! YOU'RE THE PEOPLE DOING THIS, NOT ME! THESE PEOPLE, RIGHT THERE. BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I REALLY NEED -- THANK YOU FOR THAT ENERGY BECAUSE I NEED IT BECAUSE, FOLKS, I GOTTA TELL YA, I COME TO YOU TONIGHT A SHAKEN MAN. BECAUSE RECENT REVELATIONS HAVE PROVEN THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE SYSTEMATICALLY AND REPEATEDLY LIED TO. FOR MORE, LET'S GO TO MY COLLEAGUE BRETT BAIER.
LAST NIGHT WAS THE BIG NIGHT, THE AIRING OF THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL'S EATEN ALIVE, WHERE A MAN OFFERED HIMSELF UP TO BE CONSUMED BY AN ANACONDA. MANY VIEWERS FOUND THE PAYOFF TOUGH TO SWALLOW.
TURNS OUT THE SNAKE SORT OF PUT HIS MOUTH AROUND HIS HEAD AND THE GUY TAPPED OUT AND SAID PULL ME OUT, PULL ME OUT,  AND THAT WAS IT.
70 MINUTES INTO THE SHOW, ROSOLIE TAPPED OUT SAYING THE SNAKE WAS ABOUT TO BREAK HIS ARM. SO IN THE END, ROSOLIE WAS NOT EATEN ALIVE, NOT EVEN A SCRATCH.
Stephen: FOR SHAME, DISCOVERY CHANNEL! YOU PROMISED US PAUL ROSOLIE  WOULD BE EATEN! HENCE THE TITLE "EATEN ALIVE ." BUT YOU ONLY GAVE US "CUDDLED ALIVE"! AND I'M SORRY, THAT'S JUST SNAKE FIRST BASE. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S ANGRY, FOLKS TWITTER TWEETED, "NEXT TIME I WATCH SOMETHING CALLED #EATENALIVE, SOMEBODY BETTER GET EATEN ALIVE." AND "THIS GUY HAD ONE JOB. LITERALLY ONE (BLEEP) JOB TO GET EATEN ALIVE AND HE (BLEEP) IT UP." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S OUTRAGEOUS! BUT I GOTTA SAY AS ANGRY AS I AM, DISCOVERY DID HAVE A COGENT RESPONSE. "PAUL CREATED THIS CHALLENGE TO GET MAXIMUM ATTENTION FOR ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THREATENED PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST." TRUE. THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST THAN TO COVER YOURSELF IN PIG'S BLOOD AND CLIMB INTO A SNAKE'S MOUTH. YOU SEE THAT AND YOU THINK, "MAN, WE GOTTA SAVE THOSE TREES." JUST LIKE THE BEST WAY TO SAVE OUR OCEANS IS TO PUT ON SOME FLIPPERS AND BONE A NARWHALE. I GOTTA TELL YA,  NOT EASY IN SUCH COLD WATER. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, WITH ONLY SIX SHOWS LEFT, IT IS TIME TO SAY -- (AUDIENCE: "AWWWW")
Stephen: I KNOW, I'M SAYING THAT IN THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING. IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO CLASSIC  "THE COLBERT REPORT" SEGMENTS. "THREATDOWN," "CHEATING DEATH," "WHERE ARE MY GLASSES?" WE ONLY DID THAT SEGMENT ONCE. THEY WERE IN MY CAR. WELCOME TO OBAMA'S AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) TONIGHT, I PRESENT THE LAST BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OVER THE YEARS, I'VE INTERVIEWED ONLY 81 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. STILL, 81 OUT OF 434 IS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S EVERY REMAINING DEMOCRAT. OVER THE YEARS, I'VE FENCED WITH MARCIA FUDGE, SKATE BOARDED WITH JACKIE SPEIER, LEG-WRESTLED JASON CHAFFETZ, TOSSED SALMON WITH JIM McDERMOTT, DRANK BEER WITH RUSS CARNAHAN, SHOTGUNNED BEER WITH DAN MAFFEI, FUNNELED BEER WITH JARED POLIS, AND DROPPED ACID WITH MAURICE HINCHEY. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I DON'T SEE WHY CONGRESS CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. AND TONIGHT, WE END BY RETURNING TO THE FIRST CONGRESSMAN I EVER REPUBLICAN JACK KINGSTON OF GEORGIA'S FIRST DISTRICT. JIM? CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
WELL THANK YOU
Stephen:  IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.
Stephen: FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, IN 2005, YOU WERE THE VERY FIRST MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN BY ME.
YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE MY FIRST CONGRESSMAN. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE FIRST. IT'S OVER MUCH QUICKER THAN YOU THOUGHT AND AFTERWARDS THERE'S A LOT OF WEEPING. (LAUGHTER) BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I'M VERY GRATEFUL YOU INTRODUCED ME TO THE WORLD OF CONGRESS.
IT'S A GREAT HONOR FOR ME AND FOR MY DISTRICT.
Stephen: NOT THAT IT MATTERS, BUT HAVE YOU BEEN BETTER KNOWN BY ANYBODY ELSE SINCE I BETTER KNEW YOU? IT'S NOT IMPORTANT TO ME WE'RE NOT COMMITTED TO EACH OTHER, YOU CAN BE BETTER KNOWN BY ANYONE YOU WANT.
I HAVE KNOWN OTHERS, STEPHEN.
Stephen: I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I HAVE, TOO, AND I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE CHLAMYDIA. MY DOCTOR SAID I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU THIS PAMPHLET. CHLAMYDIA IS NOT A FLOWER. READ THIS AND CALL EVERYBODY ELSE YOU'VE CONGRESSED WITH. YOU WANT TO GET CHECKED OUT.
I KNOW I WAS YOUR FIRST, WAS I YOUR FAVORITE?
Stephen: OF COURSE. OF COURSE. (LAUGHTER) CONGRESSMAN -- A LITTLE HELP. IT IS CONGRESSMAN...
JACK KINGSTON
Stephen: I KNEW THAT. TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTING FIRST. STILL NUMBER ONE?
YEAH, FOUR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, ENTIRE COAST OF GEORGIA, GREAT TOURISM, GREAT PORT.
Stephen: YOUR DISTRICT CONTAINS SAVANNAH. TELL THE  PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER HEARD OF SAVANNAH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR TOWN.
SAVANNAH WAS FOUNDED IN 1733 BY --
Stephen: THAT'S ENOUGH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS WOMAN?
NO.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU CO-SPONSORED H.R.-1815, THE LENA HORNE RECOGNITION ACT, AND YET YOU DON'T RECOGNITION LENA HORNE. YET YOU VOTED TO RECOGNIZE HER.
I THINK THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATION WAS TO RECOGNIZE THE GOOD THINGS SHE HAS DONE.
Stephen: SUCH AS? LENA HORNE --
Stephen: YEAH? I JUST REMEMBERED WHO SHE IS.
Stephen: YEAH. SHE DIED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, RIGHT?
Stephen: YEAH. MY IMAGE OF HER IS THE HEAVIER WOMAN OF LATER YEARS.
Stephen: YEAH. I WOULD'VE RECOGNIZED THAT PICTURE.
Stephen: YEAH. ALL RIGHT. QUICK FOLLOW-UP. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS WOMAN?
NO.
Stephen: THIS IS ALSO LENA HORNE. WHEN SHE'S OLDER. ABOUT THE AGE YOU SAID YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE HER. AND YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE HER AGAIN.
I GAVE LENA MY BEST.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW HAVE A FAVORITE LENA HORNE SONG?
NOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. ♪ DON'T KNOW WHY THERE'S NO SUN UP IN THE SKY ♪ ♪ STORMY WEATHER ♪
YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY VOICE.
Stephen: THANK YOU. YOU HAVE LOVELY HANDS. (LAUGHTER) LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. YOU'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. THIS IS YOUR LAST YEAR IN CONGRESS AND MY LAST SEASON OF THIS SHOW. I AM LEAVING MY SHOW BECAUSE I WON TELEVISION. DID YOU WIN CONGRESS?
WELL, I TRIED TO RUN FOR THE SENATE.
Stephen: HOW DID THAT GO? DID NOT GO WELL.
Stephen: OKAY. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO DO NEXT?
NOT CERTAIN.
Stephen: YOU AND I SHOULD DO SOMETHING TOGETHER. WE COULD OPEN A POP-UP HALLOWEEN STORE. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THOSE MAKE SERIOUS COIN.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO MISS THE OPPORTUNITY OF AFFECTING LEGISLATION AND TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER AMERICA.
Stephen: WHEN IT COMES TO TAX POLICY, YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE PROPOSED REDUCTION ON THE -- I'M SORRY. LET ME TRY THAT AGAIN. OKAY. NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO TAX POLICY AND SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS TO THE CAPS ON CAPITAL GAINS -- I -- I -- I DON'T CARE ANYMORE. I'M SORRY. I JUST -- BLAH, BLAH, BLAH... AFTER NINE YEARS AND 82 OF THESE, I'M TIRED OF ASKING THESE QUESTIONS.
AND I'M TIRED OF ANSWERING THEM.
Stephen: NOBODY EVER HAS ANY FUN UP HERE!
YOU ARE RIGHT. YOU ARE RIGHT!
Stephen:  LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
LET'S DO IT.
Stephen: HIGH FIVE.
