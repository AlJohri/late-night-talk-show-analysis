Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE, PLEASE. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THE COVER OF  "ROLLING STONE" MAGAZINE HAS  LONG BEEN A CULTURAL LANDMARK DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2006  WHEN IT FEATURED ME ALONG  WITH... I WANT TO SAY TOM DAILY? HE MAKES MOVIES NOW. I DON'T KNOW. SO WHEN A ROLLING STONE COVER  FEATURES SOMETHING  CONTROVERSIAL, PEOPLE NOTICE.
ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE IS  CAUSING A BIG STIR WITH ITS  NEWEST EDITION FEATURING THE SURVIVING BOSTON MARATHON  BOMBING SUSPECT. THE AUGUST 3 ISSUE FEATURES A  COVER OF A PHOTO OF DZHOKHAR  TSARNAEV THAT HE TOOK HIMSELF.
THIS ELECTION OF AUGUST COVER  BOY HAS GENERATED THOUSANDS OF  NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON ROLLING STONE'S FACEBOOK PAGE.
THEY ARE CALLING FOR A  BOYCOTT OF A MAGAZINE.
ORGANIZING A BOYCOTT OF A  MAGAZINE IS NO EASY TASK  BECAUSE, FIRST, YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO BUYS MAGAZINES. NOW, FOLKS, I UNDERSTAND WHY  PEOPLE ARE ANGRY THAT DZHOKHAR  TSARNAEV IS ON THE COVER BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW ROLLING STONE'S  COVERS ALWAYS FEATURED ROLE  MODELS LIKE ROMAN POLANSKI, O.J. SIMPSON OR CHARLES MANSON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHY HENT THAT DUDE PUT OUT ANY  GOOD MUSIC LATELY? HE WAS MY FAVORITE BEACH BOY. NOW FOLKS, I'M GOING TO SHOCK  SOME PEOPLE RIGHT NOW BY  DEFENDING ROLLING STONE  MAGAZINE. THEY'RE JUST USING CONTROVERSY  TO GAIN ATTENTION. LET'S FACE IT. THE MAGAZINE INDUSTRY IS DYING. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I THINK IT MAY HAVE CAUGHT  SOMETHING FROM SITTING IN ALL  THOSE DOCTORS' OFFICES. NOW BESIDES, ROLLING STONE IS  NOT DOING ANYTHING THAT HAS NOT  BEEN DONE BY OTHER MAGAZINES. I MEAN, WE ALL REMEMBER WHEN  MEN'S HEALTH HAD THEIR  CONTROVERSIAL COVER. HITLER'S FINAL SOLUTION FOR  BELLY FAT FLEW OFF THE SHELVES  AND COSMOPOLITAN'S 50 WAYS TO MAKE YOUR MAN SAY AMERICANS MUST  PAY WITH BLOOD FOR THE DEATH OF  MUSLIMS ABROAD. WARNING. NUMBER 5 IS WHVMENT WHISTLING)  ROLLING STONE, LISTEN UP. I AM NOT GOING TO BITE ON YOUR  CONTROVERSY BAIT HERE AND GIVE  YOU FREE PUBLICITY BY HOLDING UP YOUR MAGAZINE AND TALKING ABOUT  IT. NICE TRY. YOU SEE, I'M NOT A GUY WHO JUST  BUYS WHATEVER THE LATEST HYPE  IS. NO, I'M WAITING FOR THE NEXT  HYPE TO COME OUT BECAUSE THAT'S  GOING TO BE GREAT. I HEAR IT HAS BLUETOOTH. SO NATURALLY I ALSO REJECT THE  LAMESTREAM MEDIA HYPE THAT THE  REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CANNOT GET  ANYTHING DONE.
CONGRESS IS TOTALLY  DYSFUNCTIONAL.
THE HOUSE HAS BECOME A PRETTY  DYSFUNCTIONAL PLACE. THE RIGHT WING TEA PARTY CROWD  IN THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS  SEEMS TO BE RUNNING THE PLACE.
THE SITUATION ON CAPITOL HILL  IS DIRE. CONGRESS DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. AND IT CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE.
Stephen: BILL, I AM  DISAPPOINTED. HOW CAN THE HOUSE BE EXPECTED TO  GET ANYTHING DONE WHEN MANY OF  THE BILLS THEY VOTE ON DON'T EVEN REPEAL OBAMA CARE? FOR INSTANCE, TAKE THE  IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL. IT IS GOING NOWHERE IN THE HOUSE  OF REPRESENTATIVES BECAUSE IT IS  FULL OF PROBLEMS. SURE, IT MASS I HAVE BEENLY  INCREASES SECURITY ON THE  MEXICAN BORDER, BUT AS VIRGINIA REPRESENTATIVE AND NORDSTROM  MAKE-UP COUNTER VICTIM, BOB  GOODLATTE POINTS OUT, THE BILL OVERLOOKED THE NEED FOR BORDER  AGENTS IN THE INTERIOR OF OUR  COUNTRY. YES, YES, THANK YOU. OUR INTERIOR BORDERS ARE  DEFENSELESS. AND WHEN... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] CONGRESSMAN, THEY ARE APPLAUDING  FOR YOU. WHEN WILL WE BUILD THE BORDER  WALL WITH FLORIDA? WE CANNOT LET... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE CANNOT LET THOSE MANIACS INTO  OUR COUNTRY. IT IS LEGAL TO SHOOT EACH OTHER  DOWN THERE. AND LAST WEEK, JUST LAST WEEK  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PROVED  THAT THEY ARE NOT DO-NOTHINGS BY DONE DIDDING SOMETHING. THEY PASSEDDED THE FARM BILL. NOW, THAT MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE  MUCH. TRADITIONALLY THE FARM BILL IS A  ROUTINE PIECE OF LEGISLATION  WHICH PROVIDES GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES FOR FARMERS WHILE ALSO  SETTING ASIDE MONEY FOR FOOD  STAMPS. IT'S A WIN-WIN. HELP FOR THE FOLKS WHO GROW THE  CORN AND HELP FOR FOLKS WHO LIVE  ON NOTHING BUT CORN SYRUP. NOW THE HOUSE HAD NOT PASSED A  FARM BILL IN TWO YEARS BECAUSE  60 HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMANDED DEEP CAN YOUS IN FOOD STAMPS. BUT LAST WEEK HOUSE REPUBLICANS  AGREED TO AN HISTORIC COMPROMISE  ON FOOD STAMPS BY ELIMINATING THE FOOD STAMPS. JIM?
THE U.S. HOUSE NARROWLY  PASSEDDED A SCALED-DOWN FARM  BILL AFTER DROPPING FOOD STAMPS FROM THE MEASURE. FOOD STAMPS CAN WAIT BUT FARM  PROGRAMS CANNOT.
Stephen: YES, FARM PROGRAMS  CANNOT WAIT. WE NEED TO GROW THE FOOD THAT  PEOPLE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO  BUY. SEE, REPUBLICANS SHOWED THEY  WERE WILLING TO COMPROMISE BY  ELIMINATING THE PART OF THE BILL THEY REFUSED TO COMPROMISE ON. IT'S JUST LIKE A CARDIOLOGIST  WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH A  PATIENT'S HEART. INSTEAD OF GETTING BOGGED DOWN  IN COMPLICATED PROCEDURES HE  SIMPLY REMOVES THE HEART. PROBLEM SOLVED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE BEST PART... THE BEST PART,  THAT PATIENT NO LONGER NEEDS  FOOD STAMPS. AND WITHOUT THIS GOVERNMENT  HANDOUT, HE IS MOTIVATED TO  WORK. IT KEEPS HIM HUNGRY FOR SUCCESS  AND, OF COURSE, FOOD. NOW THE G.O.P. BREAKTHROUGH DID  NOT SATISFY MAINSTREAM MEDIA  STOMACH GRUMBLERS LIKE CBS SENIOR ROOT VEGETABLE BOB  SCHEIFFER.
YOU PASS A FARM BILL IN THE  HOUSE THAT GIVES BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS, MUCH OF IT TO LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT OWN FARMS. IT'S ALMOST LIKE WELFARE FOR THE  WEALTHY. BUT YOU DON'T INCLUDE A DOLLAR  FOR HUNGRY PEOPLE FOR FOOD  STAMPS. WHAT KIND OF A MESSAGE IS THAT?
Stephen: I'LL TAKE THAT ONE,  BOB. IT IS A PRINCIPLED CONSERVATIVE  MESSAGE BASED ON THE OLD ADAGE,  GIVE A MAN A FISH, HE'LL EAT FOR A DAY. TAKE AWAY HIS FOOD STAMPS AND  HE'LL FOUND FISH-CO, A  MULTINATIONAL SEAFOOD  CONGLOMERATE THAT GETS A MASSIVE SUBSIDY IN THE NEXT FARM BILL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BESIDES, FOLKS, LET'S BE CLEAR. REPUBLICANS ARE NOT OGRES. ALTHOUGH IF WE CAN FIND A CHEAP  WAY TO GRIND BONES INTO BREAD,  THEY'RE WILLING TO LISTEN. THEY JUST UNDERSTAND THAT  PROVIDING SUBSIST ENS NUTRITION  TRAPS PEOPLE IN A STATE OF POVERTY AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT. IS IT, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN  MIKE KELLY?
THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THAT'S NOT AMERICAN. THAT'S NOT WAY WE WORKED IN THE  PAST. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR FUTURE  SHOULD HOLD FOR US. IT SHOULD BE ONE OF BLUE SKIES  AND STRONG WINDS AT OUR BACKS IN  A NATION THAT HAS EVERYTHING THAT GOD COULD POSSIBLY PROVIDE  FOR US. WE HAVE TILLABLE SOIL AND  POTABLE WATER. AS FAR AS PROVIDING FOOD FOR  PEOPLE, MY GOODNESS, WE  SHOULDN'T BE VULNERABLE IN THIS COUNTRY ANY PLACE.
Stephen: YEAH, WE DON'T NEED  FOOD STAMPS. AMERICA'S BLESSED BLUE SKIES AND  STRONG WINDS AND TILLABLE SOIL  AND POTABLE WATER NOT TO MENTION EDIBLE SOIL AND DRUM STICK  WRAPPERS WITH CHOCOLATE NUTS  STUCK ON THEM. THERE'S THE OLD MAN IN THE PARK  WHO JUST GIVES AWAY BREAD  CRUMBS. HOW HARD COULD IT BE TO ELBOW A  PIGEON OUT OF THE WAY AND PECK  YOUR WAY TO A FULL STOMACH? PLUS FOOD STAMPS JUST TURNS  BEING POOR INTO SOME SORT OF  POORGASBOARD. WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO STAY HOME  AND NOT WORK WHEN YOU CAN RAKE  IN AN AVERAGE OF AN $134 A MONTH FOR FOOD. THAT'S ALMOST ONE $5 FOOT LONG A  DAY. THREE INCHES FOR BREAKFAST. FOUR INCHES FOR LUNCH. FIVE INCHES FOR DINNER. FOR DESSERT, THE PLASTIC BAG. DON'T WORRY, FOLKS. DO NOT WORRY. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE ABSOLUTELY  GOING TO PASS FUNDING FOR FOOD  STAMPS AT SOME POINT. AND WHEN THEY DON'T, IF PEOPLE  ARE STILL HUNGRY, WE'LL JUST  COMBINE THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM WITH THE IMMIGRATION PROGRAM AND  LET POOR PEOPLE EAT MEXICANS. THE BEST PART IS, THE BEST PART  IS, THEY ARE A HEALTHY SNACK  BECAUSE THEY PICK THEIR OWN  VEGETABLES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
