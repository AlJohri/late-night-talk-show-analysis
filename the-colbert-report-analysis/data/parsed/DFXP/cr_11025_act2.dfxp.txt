Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, IS A JUNIOR  SENATOR FROM VERMONT AND A SELF DESCRIBED SOCIALIST I WILL EQUALLY DISTRIBUTE MY RAGE AT HIM PLEASE WELCOME BERNIE SANDERS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SENATOR SANDERS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU ARE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM VERMONT, THE LONGEST SERVING INDEPENDENT IN CONGRESS.
AND PROUD OF IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE FIRST SELF-DESCRIBED SOCIALIST TO BE ELECTED TO THE SENATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FIRST OF ALL, AS A 73-YEAR-OLD MAN, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE JUNIOR SENATOR? DO YOU EVER SHAKE YOUR FIST AT PAT LEAHY AND SAY "GET OUT OF TOWN, OLD MAN!"
NO, HE AND I ARE PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS.
Stephen: BUT COMPARED TO YOU, HE IS, LIKE, RUSH LIMBAUGH. HE IS SO RIGHT WING. HE'S A DEMOCRAT. YOU'RE A SOCIALIST! THAT'S THE BOGEYMAN OF WASHINGTON! DO YOU FRIGHTEN PEOPLE WHEN YOU WALK AROUND THE CAPITOL? ARE THEY AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THEIR TRACTOR AND GIVE IT TO THE WHOLE VILLAGE?
HOPEFULLY, WE FRIGHTEN THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOPEFULLY, WE FRIGHTEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOESN'T HAVE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM GUARANTEEING HEALTHCARE TO ALL PEOPLE.
Stephen: BUT IT'S THE GREATEST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.  (AUDIENCE BOOS)
Stephen: DON'T BOO MY GUEST, PLEASE.
Stephen: IT'S THE GREATEST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD.
YOU ARE RIGHT -- IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY, IT IS AN EXCELLENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.
Stephen: I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, FOR MANY OTHER FOLKS, FOR THE 40 MILLION WHO HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE, IT AIN'T SUCH A GOOD SYSTEM.
Stephen: I THOUGHT ObamaCare WAS GOING TO FIX THAT, SIR, OR DID YOU SELL US A BILL OF GOODS?
OBAMACARE PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR ABOUT 10 MILLION MORE AMERICANS BUT WE REMAIN THE ONLY COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE HEALTHCARE TO ALL OUR PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT. HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE A RIGHT (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I AGREE WITH YOU HALFWAY. I AGREE WITH YOU HALFWAY. WE ARE THE ONLY MAJOR COUNTRY ON EARTH -- PERIOD. (LAUGHTER) EVERYBODY ELSE IS JUST A PLACE THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE AMERICA.
I'M NOT SO SURE.
Stephen: OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICAN POLITICS RIGHT NOW. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, YOU LIBERAL TYPES GOT YOUR ASSES HANDED TO YOU BY THE REPUBLICANS. OKAY, DEMOCRATS GOT SLAUGHTERED. SOCIALISTS ACTUALLY DID BETTER. YOU GUYS DIDN'T LOSE ANY SEATS. (LAUGHTER) HOW BAD IS IT FOR THE DEMOCRATS IF THE SOCIALISTS DID BETTER THAN THE DEMOCRATS? DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A REJECTION? A RED TIDE SWEPT ACROSS THE NATION. WE HAVE REJECTED LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY.
I WILL TELL YOU, STEPHEN, WHAT I THINK REALLY HAPPENED IS ABOUT 64% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REJECTED THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM. THEY REJECTED WASHINGTON AS IT NOW FUNCTIONS. THEY REJECTED A POLITICAL SYSTEM AND A CONGRESS WHICH SPENDS MORE TIME REPRESENTING THE WEALTHY AND THE POWERFUL THAN ORDINARY AMERICANS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK AND WE'LL COME BACK. I'VE GOT A QUESTION ABOUT YOUR AMBITIONS, ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: STICK AROUND, SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
