Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS A GUY OG/GYN ON HER SITCOM THE MINDY PROJECT. I'LL ASK HER WHERE BABIES COME FROM. PLEASE WELCOME MINDY KALING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY, MISS KALING, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
I'M FLATTERED TO BE HERE.
Stephen: I AM SO GLAD WE DIDN'T WEAR THE SAME SKIRT. ALL RIGHT, THANKS FOR COMING HERE. I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN, MY WHOLE FAMILY IS. WE LOVE WATCHING THE SHOW, I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING ON TV LIKE IT AND ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THE SHOW --
THANK YOU, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. WE CAN PAUSE AND COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT ME.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOUR LEGS BEFORE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE VERY BECOMING.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S VERY NICE, A LOVELY DRESS YOU'RE WEARING.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP NOW.
OKAY.
Stephen: YOU GET A LOT OF PROPS, OKAY, FOR-- FOR, YOU WRITE THIS SHOW. YOU PRODUCE THIS SHOW. YOU STAR IN THIS SHOW. AND YOU'RE A POWERFUL WOMAN MAKING IT HAPPEN FOR HERSELF. IS THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT I SHOULD USE ABOUT YOU?
YEAH, I LOVE THAT.
Stephen: YOU'RE A SISTER DOING IT FOR HERSELF. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO YOU ENJOY SPEAKING FOR ALL WOMEN OR FOR ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR? (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I DO FEEL SOME RESPONSIBILITY THAT I LIKE BEING, BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. AND I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE A REALLY COOL JOB LIKE MINE IT'S LAME TO SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A ROLE MODEL. BUT IT CAN BE A LOT IT CAN FEEL OVERWHELMING AT TIMES TOO.
Stephen: YOU PLAY AN OG/GYN ON THIS SHOW.
YES.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL TRAINING?
NO, NO. AND THANK GOD, NO.
Stephen: DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A TV DOCTOR OR DID YOU HOPE TO GROW UP AND BE A TV LAWYER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? DID YOUR PARENTS WANT YOU TO BE AN ACTRESS?
THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BRAG ABOUT ME TO THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY WORK. SO--
Stephen: AT WHAT POINT COULD THEY DO THAT? BECAUSE YOU'RE ALSO, YOU'RE ALSO EMMY NOMINATED ACTRESS, WRITER AND EIGHT YEARS ON THE OFFICE, WROTE 24 EPISODES AND DIRECTED TWO OF THOSE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT WAS VERY NICE, THANKS.
Stephen: IS THAT THE TIPPING POINT FOR YOU? DOES THE PARENT BRAG TIPPING POINT?
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHEN THE OFFICE WAS ON BECAUSE THEY LOVED THE SHOW SOME OF AND THEY WERE OBSESSED WITH STEVE CARELL, SO THEY GOT TO COME AND BE ON THE SHOW AS ACTORS, WHICH WAS REALLY NICE.
Stephen: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. YOU GOT TO CAST YOUR FOLKS?
YEAH, THAT'S NEPOTISM. THAT'S WHAT LIKE I-- I DID THAT AND SO THEY-- .
Jon: JON STEWART IS MY UNCLE. THAT'S HOW I GOT STARTED. (APPLAUSE) I LOVE IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW YOU GOT A LITTLE CONTROVERSY LATELY. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED YOU BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT PERHAPS AS AN OB/GYN YOU DON'T DO LIKE THE TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUNDS ON THE SHOW, YOU DON'T DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF ABORTION ON YOUR SHOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING.
WELL, I SAID THAT YOU KNOW, MY SHOW IS AS MUCH ABOUT GYNECOLOGY AS THE OFFICE WAS ABOUT PAPER. AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF WOMEN, LIKE LOOK TO ME AND LOOK TO THE SHOW AS -- THEY WANT ME TO BE A SPOKESPERSON FOR A LOT OF ISSUES. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT I THINK IS COOL. LIKE I WANT TO LIVE UP TO THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, ABORTION IS NOT A HILARIOUS SUBJECT. AND-- .
Stephen: A FUNNY WORD.
IT'S A FUNNY WORD.
Stephen: LIKE GUACOMOLE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
BUT I GUESS-- .
Stephen: I CAN UNDERSTAND.
NO, BUT I MEAN LIKE I WANT TO-- I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK PLAINLY ABOUT THINGS BUT I ALSO WANT TO CREATE AN ENTERTAINING SHOW. WE HAVEN'T FOUND A HILARIOUS TAKE ON ABORTION THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING NEW YET. BUT WE MIGHT.
Stephen: WITHOUT ANY SPOILERS, THIS YEAR TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS? (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, DO YOU-- DO YOU-- I UNDERSTAND THIS SEASON GETS A LITTLE SEXY.
IT DOES.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A SEXY TIME THIS YEAR?
I DO. THERE'S A LOT OF SEXINESS. MY CO-STAR, CHRIS MESSINA AND I, OUR CHARACTERS START DATING THIS YEAR. AND IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN WE FIRST DID IT I USED TO HAVE A REVOLVING DOOR OF GOOD LOOKING BOYFRIENDS ON THE SHOW.
Stephen: WHY WOULDN'T YOU. YOU ARE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT.
I'M A CROOK, I HIRE PARENTS, I HAVE ACTORS COME ON THE SHOW AND MAKE OUT WITH ME. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT THE NEXT TIME I'M ON. BUT I-- SO THIS YEAR WE'RE LIKE OH, WILL IT BE BORING, LIKE I'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED. SO OH, IS MONOGAMY LIKE A BORING THING BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST LIKE WITH THIS AND IT'S NOT.
Stephen: NO, IT'S SUPEREXCITING ALL THE TIME.
IN OUR SHOW-- (LAUGHS)
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT AT FACE VALUE.
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD T IS.
AS IT TURNS OUT THE CHARACTER IS KIND OF A PERVERT AND SO IS MINE SO IT'S KIND OF FUNNY AND SEXY.
Stephen: WOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT WATCH THAT.
OKAY.
Stephen: THE NEW SEASON STARTS TOMORROW NIGHT.
TOMORROW NIGHT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AND AGAIN, SPEAKING FOR ALL WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MINDY KALING, THE MINDY PROJECT AIRS TUESDAYS 9:30 ON FOX. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
