Stephen: WELCOME -- WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ACTUCALLY TWO GUESTS. PLEASE WELCOME MARY MAZZIO AND OSCAR VAZQUEZ.
OSCAR, MARY NICE TO MEET YOU. SIT DOWN, THANKS FOR COMING HERE. EXPLAIN TO THE FOLKS WHO YOU ARE. MARY YOU ARE AN AWARD-WINNING DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, A LAWYER, FORMER OLYMPIC ATHLETE, NOT TOO SHABBY.
THANK YOU.
OSCAR YOU ARE AN ENGINEER AND YOUR HIGH SCHOOL ROBOTICS TEAM IN ARIZONA IS THE SUBJECT OF UNDERWATER DREAMS, A DOCUMENTARY THE TWO OF YOU MADE TOGETHER. WHAT DOES UNDERWATER DREAMS MEAN WHAT IS THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT.
THE SO THE DREAM IS ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM AND IF YOU WORK HARD IN THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING OF YOURSELF.
Stephen: A HOUSE, 2.4 KIDS, THAT KIND OF THING EXACTLY. AND THE UNDERWATER IS ABOUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY STORY ABOUT OSCAR AND THREE OTHER BOYS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT, HIGH SCHOOL BOYS, BUILT AN UNDERWATER ROBOT OUT OF STICKS AND CHEWING GUM AND BITS AND PIECES FROM HOME DEPOT, HAULED ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A BEAT UP VAN.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS, ALL HISPANIC, ALL BY THE WAY, INCIDENTALLY UNDOCUMENTED.
Stephen: SO THE UNDERWATER ROBOT WAS TO SMUGGLE MORE CHILDREN ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE. LET'S PUT OUR CARDS ON THE TABLE.
SO THEY HAULED ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A BEAT UP VAN. THEY ENTER THIS  UNDERWATER REALLY SOPHISTICATED UNDERWATER ROBOTICS COMPETITION. THEY WALK IN, THERE WERE SHINY ROBOTS.
THIS THING IS HELD BY NASA.
NASA IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS. OFFICE OF THE NAVY WAS ANOTHER AND SHOCKINGLY FAST FORWARD TO THE END, THE BOYS WALK IN. THEY COMPETE AGAINST COLLEGE TEAMS AND SHOCKINGLY, THEY ENDED UP DEFEATING THE LIKES OF M.I.T.
Stephen: THEY ARE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. OSCAR, WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU WENT, DID YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GO THERE AND KICK A LITTLE ASS OR WERE YOU JUST THERE ON A LARK.
WE WERE JUST GOING TO COMPETE OUT THERE AND WE DECIDED TO COMPETE AGAINST UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE IF WE LOST AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY IT WASN'T GONNA BE A BIG DEAL, BEING IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW. BUT WINNING WAS A VERY BIG DEAL.
YES.
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR ROBOT.
WHAT DID IT HAVE TO DO.
IT HAD TO GO UNDERWATER, TAKE WATER SAMPLES, FIND CERTAIN PIECES OF THE SUBMARINE UNDERWATER, TAKE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS AND GRAB A FEW THINGS UNDERWATER.
WERE THERE ANY CRISIS MOMENTS. BECAUSE THOSE THINGS TEND TO BREAK AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
WE HAD SPECIFICALLY THERE WAS ONE WHERE WE WERE GETTING WATER LEAKING INTO THE ELECTRONICS COMPARTMENT BUT LUCKILY ONE OF OUR FRIENDS CAME UP WITH A GREAT IDEA TO FIX IT.
WHAT --
HE USED-- TAMPONS TO GET OUT THE --
REALLY.
OUT OF THE ELECTRONICS.
THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD COMMERCIAL.
YES.
BECAUSE THEY NEVER SHOW WHAT THEY ARE REALLY FOR. WE'VE GOT A CLIP OF THE MOVIE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
HERE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL TEAM THAT HAD ENTERED THE COLLEGIATE DIVISION OF THE COMPETITION. OBSERVATIONLY CALLED THE EXPLORER CLASS. IT WAS FOR MULTIFUNCTIONAL REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLES.
WE WERE GOING WITH THE MIND-SET THAT WE WERE GOING MAINLY AS OBSERVERS AS AN EXPLORATORY TYPE OF THING. IF WE ENTER THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND WE GET BEAT THAT WILL BE EMBARRASSING.
THE TEACHERS DIDN'T WANT THE BOYS TO GET TOTALLY DEMORALIZED.
WE FIGURED IF WE ENTERED THE COLLEGE LEVEL AND LOST IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BIG DEAL.
I WAS LIKE MAN, AS LONG AS WE DON'T FINISH LAST, WE KNEW WE WEREN'T GOING TO WIN. AND IF WE JUST BEAT ONE COLLEGE THAT WOULD BE PHENOMENAL.
I ASSUME YOU GOT SCHOLARSHIPS, WENT TO COLLEGE. BECAUSE WE DO NEED ENGINEERS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TEAM
WELL, AFTER GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL, I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST. THEN I WENT TO ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. BUT DURING THAT TIME ARIZONA PASSED THE LAW THAT KIND OF PREVENTED US FROM GETTING SCHOLARSHIPS TO GO TO ARIZONA STATE SO ONE OF MY TEAMMATES HAD TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE FOR THAT REASON.
ARE YOU WORKING AS AN ENGINEER NOW.
I'M WORKING IN THE ENGINEERING FIELD YES.
SO YOU SELF-DEPORTED, SO MITT ROMNEY WAS RIGHT. YOU SELF-DEPORTED AND WENT BACK TO MEXICO AND GOT BACK IN LINE. HOW DID YOU GET BACK IN.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN HEARD ABOUT MY STORY THROUGH SOME OF THE LOCAL LEADERS AND HE KIND OF LOOKED AT MY APPLICATION ONE MORE TIME AND ONCE THEY DID, THEY GAVE ME A GREEN CARD AFTERWARDS AND THEN YOU JOINED THE MILITARY.
JOINED THE ARMY.
AND SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN.
YES, I DID, ONE TOUR IN AFGHANISTAN.
OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IF YOU EVER GET SICK GET YOURSELF TO A LOWES BY THE WAY.
I WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND OKAY. SO WHAT IS THE MESSAGE HERE BECAUSE I'M FEELING A MESSAGE.
WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU FEELING? >>.
I'M FEELING THAT IMMIGRANTS THAT WE MAY NOT NECESSARILY WANT IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE --
CAN ACTUALLY DO GOOD THINGS.
Stephen: DON'T INTERRUPT ME. (LAUGHTER)
I WAS SO CLOSE, I WAS SO CLOSE TO GETTING YOUR MESSAGE. NOW I THINK THE MESSAGE IS SECURE OUR BORDERS. (LAUGHTER) ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND, OSCAR, IS WHY AS SOMEONE COMING FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY TO THE UNITED STATES LOOKING FOR A JOB WOULD YOU WANT TO BUILD ROBOTS. BECAUSE THE ROBOTS ARE GOING TO TAKE ALL OF OUR JOBS.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO ANSWER FOR THAT ACTUALLY.
ALL RIGHT.
I LIKE THAT.
OSCAR, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE MOVIE IS UNDERWATER DREAMS. ORDER IT NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
