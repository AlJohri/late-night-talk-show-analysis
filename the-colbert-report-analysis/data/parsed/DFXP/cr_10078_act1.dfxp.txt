( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  OH, HEY! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA, AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. FOLKS, YOU CAN FEEL THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW. THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW BEFORE WE TAKE A WEEK OFF FOR SPRING BREAK. I AM GOING TO MISS YOU BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE BECAUSE MY DOCTOR SAYS I NEED TO LOAD UP ON VITAMIN BACARDI. THAT'S GOOD OLD ALCOHOL-- SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WHEN ADMINISTERED ORALLY. BUT FIRST, TONIGHT, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MARIJUANA. OR AS THE KIDS-- ( CHEERS ) YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. IT FRIGHTENS ME, TOO. ( LAUGHTER ) MARIJUANA, OR AS THE KIDS CALL IT, JAZZ CIGARETTES. JUST BECAUSE IT COMES FROM NATURE, PEOPLE THINK IT'S HARMLESS, BUT IF POT WERE SO SAFE, THEN WHY IS EVERYONE FROM THE MOVIE "REFER MADNESS" NOW DEAD? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT RECENT NEWS FROM COLORADO, A.K.A. "POT"SYLVANIA, HAS CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.
GREEN MAKES GREEN. NEW NUMBERS SHOW COLORADO RAKING IN ABOUT $2 MILLION IN ITS FIRST MONTH OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA SALES. THAT'S FROM TAXES.
THAT FIGURE IS BASED ON TOTAL SALES OF $14 MILLION DURING THE FIRST MONTH IT BECAME LEGAL.
THAT STATE'S GOVERNOR THINKS MARIJUANA SALES WILL BRING IN MORE THAN $600 MILLION A YEAR.
Stephen:  $600 MILLION! FOLKS, THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN, AND THE MARKET IS TOKIN' ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS A STAUNCH CAPITALIST, I MUST NOW HONOR MY LONG-STANDING PLEDGE TO INSTANTLY DITCH MY MORALS FOR ANYTHING PROFITABLE. FIRST UP, I'M GOING TO NEED A LITTLE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE, OKAY, SO I SWIPED AN APPLE FROM THE OFFICE FRIDGE, AND I ALSO SWIPED SOME WEED, ALSO FROM THE OFFICE FRIDGE. I DON'T CARE IF YOUR NAME WAS ON IT, JERRY, ALL RIGHT? NOW FROM WHAT I READ ON REDDIT, IT'S EASY TO TURN THIS BAD BOY INTO A PIPE. I JUST HOLLOW OUT-- I JUST HOLLOW OUT ONE LITTLE THING HERE, AND I TAKE SOME OF THAT DP SPRINKLE THAT IN THERE. AND THEN... MMMM. MMMM. MAN. THAT IS SOME TART STANK. NOW, FOLKS, CLEARLY-- ( LAUGHTER ) CLEARLY, THERE'S SOME CASH TO BE MADE HERE. AND IF YOU WANT A PIECE OF THE PIE, AND IF YOU'RE HIGH, YOU DO-- I'M GOING TO HELP YOU MAKE SOME MONEY RIGHT NOW WITH THE HELP-- OH" OF A BIG RED BUTTON.
ARE YOU A COP? YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF YOU'RE A COP. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT'S." BEARS AND BALLS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEARS AND BOWLS EDITION. HI, NATION. WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICEAVE NEW GOLD RUSH. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, OLD TIMER? WEEEEED! THERE'S WEEEEED IN THEM THERE HILLS. WEEEEED! ( COUGHING ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) AND FOR SOME BUSINESSMEN, THE CASH IS ALREADY POURING IN.
WE WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO ONE FAMILY WHO IS AMONG THE FIRST AMERICANS TO BECOME MILLIONIARES IN THE LEGAL POT BUSINESS, COLORADO'S FIRST FAMILY OF POT.
I AM COORDINATOR OF OPERATIONS. I DO THE LEAST OUT OF ALL THREE OF US. ( LAUGHS ) I BRING LUNCH. HERE WE GO INTO THE WAREHOUSE, A SITE VERY FEW PEOPLE GET TO SEE.
IT'S CRAZY. I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. MY DAD DIVORCED MY MOM AND STARTED GROWING IN OUR BASEMENT, AND THAT'S WHERE IT ALL STARTED.
Stephen:  WOW. SOUNDS LIKE AFTER THE DIVORCE, SOMEONE WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS WANTED TO COME TO THEIR HOUSE ON THE WEEKEND. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MOST DADS JUST GET AN X-BOX. FOLKS, THERE'S A NAME FOR POT PIONEERS LIKE THIS.
THEY'RE BEING CALLED GANJAPRENEURS.
GANJAPRENEURS.
GANJAPRENEURS.
SO-CALLED GANJAPRENEURS.
Stephen:  YES, GANJAPRENEURS, OR A TOKE-COON, OR A CAPTAIN OF INDO-WEED. A WARREN PUFF-ETT. A WILLIE NELSON ROCKEFELLER.   ( APPLAUSE ) BESIDES SELLING SMOKEABLES THERE IS ALSO BIG MONEY IN OTHER THINGS FULL OF POT LIKE-- MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY. NO. WOODY HARRELSON. NO, GOOD SHOW, THOUGH. THE MUNCHIES. YES. SPECIFICALLY, MUNCHIES MADE OUT OF MARIJUANA. BECAUSE THESE DAYS, GETTING BAKED INVOLVES ACTUAL BAKERIES.
THE PRODUCTION OF INFUSED EDIBLES AND OTHER NONSMOKABLE PRODUCTS HAS TAKEN OFF. MAKING UP NEARLY 40% OF ALL RECREATIONAL POT SALES. AT DENVER'S INCREDIBLES EDIBLES, THEY'RE CRANKING OUT 40,000 MARIJUANA-INFUSED CANDY BARS A MONTH, IN A KITCHEN UNLIKE ANY WE'D SEEN BEFORE. BOB ASHINO RUNS THE COMPANY. TODAY, HIS TEAM IS COOKING UP STRAWBERRY COUGH CRUNCH BARS. STRAWBERRIES, WHITE CHOCOLATE, AND 100 MILLIGRAMS OF PURE HASH OIL IN EACH AND EVERY BAR.
Stephen:  THANK YOU STONER ICON, HARRY SMITH. GET A HAIRCUT, YOU HIPPIE! NOW, WITH POT CANDY, YOU DON'T JUST TASTE RAINBOW. YOU ARE THE RAINBOW. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, IF GUMMY BEARS AND LOLLIPOPS AREN'T ADULT ENOUGH FOR YOU, OTHER SHOPS OFFER T.H.C.-LADEN SODA, BEEF JERKY AND GANJA HOUSE PIZZA. SO FAR THEY DON'T SELL CRAZY BREAD, BUT YOU CAN BUY GARLIC PARANOIA KNOTS. IF YOUR CONSCIENCE DOESN'T ALLOW  YOU TO SELL POT, THERE ARE INDIRECT WAYS TO CASH IN ON COLORADO'S NEW MARIJUANA CRAZE LIKE CLEAN URINE SALESMAN. NO. SCALPING FISH TICKETS. GETTING CLOSER. ROAD TRIP.
Stephen:  JOIN THE GROWING FIELD OF MARIJUANA TOURISM. DENVER IS BECOMING THE NEW AMSTERDAM, ONLY WITH FEWER AMERICANS. JIM.
SEARCHES FOR ONLINE TRAVEL DEALS TO DENVER ARE OUTPACING ALL OTHER SEARCHES FOR ALL U.S. DESTINATIONS.
A COMPANY CALLED MY 420 TOURS, THEY WILL PICK YOU UP AT THE AIRPORT, CONNECT WITH YOU A POT-FRIENDLY HOTEL.
ADDISON MORSE OWNS THIS TOUR COMPANY, COLORADO ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH, AND CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND, EVEN AT ABOUT $300 PER PERSON.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS-- A MARIJUANA SKI BUS, THIS COMPANY OFFERING TO PICK UP POT TOURISTS D.I.A., AND TAKE THEM STRAIGHT TO THE SLOPES, WHILE THEY SMOKE ON THE RIDE THERE.
Stephen:  OKAY, HERE'S HOW YOU SPOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE MARIJUANA SKI BUS-- THEY'RE THE ONES SNOWBOARDING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE POINT IS-- THE POINT IS--   ( CHEERS ) DENVER, COLORADO, IS QUICKLY BECOMING AMERICA'S BIGGEST TOURIST DESTINATION, THOUGH YOUR VACATION PHOTOS MAY NEED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RED EYE REDUCTION. BUT, FOLKS THERE'S ONE PROBLEM EVERY SUCCESSFUL GANJAPRENEUR MUST NOW DEAL WITH. TAKE YOUR KID TO WORK DAY. NO. MEXICAN DRUG LORDS.
Stephen:  THEY ARE THINSKINNED, BUT NO.
MO MONEY, MO PROBLEMS.
Stephen:  YES, BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE MADE YOUR STASH FROM YOUR STASH, WHERE DO YOU STASH IT?
FROM COAST TO COAST, BANK AND CREDIT UNION TRADE GROUPS  ADVISING THEIR MEMBER BANKS TO STEER CLEAR OF THE MARIJUANA BUSINESS. UNDER FEDERAL LAW, MARIJUANA'S NO DIFFERENT THAN HARD-CORE ILLEGAL DRUGS LIKE HEROIN AND ECSTASY.
Stephen:  YES, IF BANKERS ACCEPT DRUG MONEY, THEY MIGHT GO TO JAIL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT AM I SAYING! WHAT AM I SAYING! THAT'S GOT TO BE A TYPO. WHOEVER WROTE THAT LINE WAS HIGH. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, THANKFULLY SOME BUDNESS OWNERS HAVE FOUND A WORKAROUND.
WE BANK WITH COMPANIES WITH A DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL RELATIONSHIP. I THINK THEY HAVE A STRONG SUSPICION.
Stephen:  I HAVE A STRONG SUSPICION, TOO, SINCE I CAN'T EVEN SEE YOU THROUGH ALL THAT DOPE SMOKE. BUT, FOLKS-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE IS CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE THE BANK TOO SUSPICIOUS.
WE TAKE GREAT PAINS TO HELP THEM IGNORE IT BY, YOU KNOW, PAYING OUR VENDORS WITH CASH. WE ALSO FEBREZE THE MONEY SO IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE MARIJUANA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  YES, THEY FEBREZE THE MONEY. THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THE SMELL OFF A $100 BILL, BUT EVERYONE CAN SEE BEN IS BAKED OUT OF HIS GHORD. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT'S BEARS AND BALLS. JOIN US NEXT TIME WHEN WE PROFILE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOTTEN FILTHY RICH PUSHING DRUGS LIKE.
PFIZER.
Stephen:  NO, NO, I MEAN, WHEN I HIGHLIGHT ANOTHER PLACE BESIEGED BY RAMPANT DRUG ABUSE.
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.
Stephen:  NO, NO, I MEAN PLACES OUTSIDE OF COLORADO WHERE POT USE IT BOOMING.
EVERYWHERE!
Stephen:  CLOSE ENOUGH.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
