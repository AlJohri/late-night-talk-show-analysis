Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, THANK YOU, PLEASE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE BIG NEWS. MYSTERIOUS LETTERS SENT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MISSISSIPPI SENATOR ROGER WICKER. TESTS INDICATE THESE LETTERS CONTAIN THE POISON RICIN. SADLY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PUBLIC EYE, THIS STUFF HAPPENS. THAT'S WHY I NEVER OPEN MY OWN EMAIL. THIS IS A FAST-MOVING STORY AND  THERE'S STILL A LOT WE DON'T KNOW. FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S A SENATOR ROGER WICKER? THERE'S ONLY 100 OF THESE FOLKS  AND I NEVER HEARD THAT NAME BEFORE. ROGER WICKER DOES NOT SOUND PLAUSIBLE AS A SENATOR. SOUNDS MORE LIKE A PATIO  FURNITURE STORE. NEXT THING YOU'RE TELLING ME  THERE'S A CONGRESSWOMAN JENNIFER CONVERTIBLE. SO, THE POINT IS WE DON'T REALLY  KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT THIS RICIN  SITUATION, BUT IN BOSTON 48 HOURS AFTER THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN THE REPORTING OF  ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE DON'T KNOW.
INVESTIGATORS HAVE IDENTIFIED A SUSPECT.
I WAS TOLD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL THAT THIS WAS A  DARK-SKINNED MALE.
SUSPECT HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN THE BOSTON BOMBINGS.
THE SUSPECT WAS A  DARK-SKINNED MALE.
GETTING SOME CONFLICTING REPORTS ABOUT AN ARREST.
THERE IS NO ARREST. WE KNEW WE WERE CLOSE. APPARENTLY NO SUSPECT AT HAND OR ONE ARRESTED. THEY MIGHT BE CLOSE OR THEY... WELL, THEY MIGHT HAVE ARRESTED.
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY REPORTS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS SAYING WHAT TO WHOM.
WE DON'T KNOW. A DARK-SKINNED MALE. Stephen: SO, NO ARREST BUT AT  LEAST WE HAVE NOT WASTED ANY PRECIOUS TIME NOT BEING  SUSPICIOUS OF DARK-SKINNED  MALES. BUT THERE IS ONE THING I DO KNOW, FOLKS, IS THAT I AM HEAVILY INVESTED IN SOMETHING CALLED BIT COYNE. NOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT BIT  COYNE IS, WANT TO BUY SOME BIT COYNE? NO? ARE YOU SURE? OKAY, JIMMY.
TELL THEM WHAT IT IS. IT IS DIGITAL COINS TREATED BETWEEN COMPUTERS. THE WRITER OF THE PROGRAM  CREATED A FINITE AMOUNT. LIKE GOLD, THE VALUE CHANGES DAILY.
BIT-COIN IS GOLD FOR NERDS, IF YOU WILL
Stephen: YES. GOLD FOR NERDS. OR AS WE NERDS CALL IT, MITHRIL. STRONGER THAN STEEL. MINED BY THE DWARFS MORIA UNTIL  THEY DUG TOO DEEPLY AND RELEASED HER IN VEIN. AND RELEASED DURIN'S BANE. YOU KNOW. BIT-COIN. BIT-COIN JOINS A RICH TRADITION  OF MADE-UP CURRENCIES LIKE CAMEL CASH AND THE EURO. BUT INLIKE CURRENCIES RUN BY A CABAL OF CENTRAL BANKERS, BIT-COIN IS A PURELY ONLINE CURRENCY WITH NO INTRINSIC  VALUE. ITS WORTH IS BASED SOLELY ON THE WILLINGNESS OF HOLDERS AND MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT IT IN TRADE. THAT'S RIGHT. BIT-COIN HAS WORTH JUST BECAUSE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET HAVE AGREED THAT IT IS WORTH SOMETHING. LIKE PSY.
ESSENTIALLY THE ONLINE WORLD IS THE CENTRAL BANK HERE. JUST IMAGINE IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE WAS TAKEN OVER BY  GAMESTOP. NOW YOU CAN GET BIT-COIN BY THIS  PROCESS CALLED MINING IT WHICH  IS USING YOUR COMPUTER TO CRUNCH A BUNCH OF NUMBERS OR SOMETHING BUT YOU CAN ALSO BUY IT. SO AS A THREUD INVESTOR, I WAITED UNTIL JUST THE RIGHT�i MOMENT.
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BUY BIT-COINS, I FIRST PUBLICLY  RECOMMENDED IT AROUND A NICKEL A COIN. NOW IT'S $133.
LAST THURSDAY BIT-COINS WERE SELLING FOR ABOUT $130. EARLIER TODAY THEY HIT AN  ALL-TIME HIGH OF $266.
Stephen: BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY. BIT-COIN PLUNGING MORE THAN $200 IN VALUE. IT TOOK AN ABSOLUTE NOSE DIVE.
IT CRASHED. BIT-COIN'S VALUE CRASHED.
BIT-COIN IS GOING BANANAS. I'M READY TO VOMIT AFTER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TODAY.
Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DID THIS UNREGULATED IMAGINARY CURRENCY INVENTED BY  AN ANONYMOUS HACKER AND BACKED  BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF YOU-TUBE COMMENTS EVER GO WRONG? HERE TO TELL ME, PLEASE WELCOME  ONE OF THE HOSTS OF N.P.R.'S  PLANET MONEY, ADAM DAVIDSON. ADAM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. ADAM, SO WHAT CAUSED THIS CRASH, OKAY? WAS THERE A BIT-COIN BUBBLE?
WHICH CRASH AND WHICH BUBBLE  Stephen: THE CRASH THAT JUST  HAPPENED THIS PAST WEEK WHERE IT WAS AT $266 AND WENT DOWN TO $56 OR SOMETHING.
IT WENT UP TO 100 AND DOWN TO  60 AND DOWN TO 95 JUST TODAY.
Stephen: AT THIS MOMENT DO I BUY OR SELL BIT-COIN, THIS  SECOND?
NEVER BUY BIT-COIN WOULD BE MY ADVICE
Stephen: IT'S A HOT NEW  THING. YP SHOULDN'T I BUY THE THING THAT IS SOMETIMES WORTH  SOMETHING?
IF YOU DO HAVE MONEY THAT YOU  HAVE NO NEED TO USE EVER AGAIN  IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH IT, THAT'S A REASONABLE INVESTMENT BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO  KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH  IN FIVE MINUTES LET ALONE FIVE YEARS.
Stephen: IS THERE ANYWAY OF KNOWING WHAT GOLD IS WORTH BECAUSE GOLD IS... WHAT IS GOLD WORTH? GOLD JUST TANKED. THE WORST DAY IN 33 YEARS.
THE PROBLEM WITH THINKING TOO  MUCH ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS IS  YOU START THINKING, WAIT, WHAT IS MONEY? WHAT IS VALUE?
Stephen: ADAM, WHAT IS MONEY? WHAT IS IT? WHAT DON'T I GET ABOUT BIT-COIN? HOW IS IT NOT MONEY?
WELL, IT IS MONEY. I LIKE MONEY. BUT MONEY THAT HAS A VERY LONG HISTORY OF BACKING BY A  GOVERNMENT LIKE THE UNITED  STATES GOVERNMENT THAT HAS HUNDREDS OF YEARS, TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
Stephen: HOW DID BIT-COIN GET  WHERE IT IS IF THERE IS NOTHING  BEHIND IT, HOW DID IT GET THERE?
IT IS AN UNBELIEVABLY COOL COMPUTER PROGRAM. IT HAS FIGURED OUT ALL SORTS OF  THINGS ABOUT HOW TO CREATE TRUST  AMONG WEIRD STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET WHO WILL NEVER MEET EACH OTHER.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A  PYRAMID SCHEME OR SOMETHING. COULD THERE BE SOME GUY AT THE  MIDDLE OF THIS WHO CREATED IT  WHO IS JUST RAKING IN ALL THE CASH AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS IS A CASH.
THE GUY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT  OR THE GUYS OR THE GIRLS OR THE COMPUTER
Stephen: WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO MADE IT.
WE KNOW A NAME BUT WE KNOW NOBODY IS CALLED THAT. SOMEBODY OUT THERE SAYS...
Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE A FAKE NAME. THERE A PLACE WHERE BIT-COIN IS?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE BIT-TORRENT  IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ALL...
Stephen: ALL PORNOGRAPHY. AND GAME OF THRONES.
Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT OTHER THAN TO HAVE IT? CAN YOU DO THINGS WITH THIS?
YES, THERE ARE WAYS TO USE IT TO BUY AND SELL
Stephen: WHAT ARE PEOPLE BUYING MOSTLY WITH IT?
DRUGS, CREDIT CARDS. ILLEGAL
Stephen: YOU CAN BUY DRUGS NOW THOUGH? WHAT'S THE VALUE OF BUYING DRUGS WITH BIT-COIN.
FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO DO  SOMETHING SHADY OR SOMEONE WHO IS JUST A FANATIC APT EYE  GOVERNMENT LIBERTARIAN IS THERE'S NO WAY TO TRACK YOU. IF YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD  ONLINE THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE.
Stephen: NO ONE BUYS DRUGS WITH A CREDIT CARD, MAN. LIKE $20. YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS TRACING  THAT, YOU KNOW, NOTHING, YOU KNOW, TUNE IN. CASH IS UNTRACEABLE.
CASH IS UNTRACEABLE BUT YOU DO HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE. TODAY I WANTED TO BUY BIT-COINS  SO I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE. AND WHAT I FOUND WAS A GUY NAMED  TRADER 675 WAS WILLING TO MEET  ME FOR CASH SO THERE WOULD BE NO TRACEABLE, YOU KNOW, NO CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION
Stephen: YOU'RE ON THE N.P.R. RIGHT?
OKAY  Stephen: DO YOU GUYS TAKE BIT-COIN IN EXCHANGE FOR LIKE TOTE BAGS? DO YOU GUYS TAKE IT AS A  DONATION?
WE DON'T YET. Stephen: MAYBE, IF BIT-COIN  GETS THERE, WE KNOW BIT-COIN HAS MADE IT.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT  Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. HOST OF N.P.R.'S PLANET MONEY ADAM DAVIDSON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
