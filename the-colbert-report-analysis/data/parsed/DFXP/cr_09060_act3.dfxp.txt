[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE EDITOR  OF "THE OXFORD AMERICAN," A  MAGAZINE THAT EXPLORES SOUTHERN  CULTURE. I BELIEVE IT COMES IN PRINT,  ONLINE, OR DEEP FRIED. PLEASE WELCOME ROGER HODGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Stephen: HAVE A SEAT. YOU ARE THE EDITOR OF "THE  OXFORD AMERICAN."  HERE IS THE MAGAZINE RIGHT HERE. IT'S CALLED THE NEW YORKER OF  SOUTH.
I'VE HEARD THAT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD  THAT. I SAID IT EARLIER IN THE SHOW SO  YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD IT FROM ME. [LAUGHTER] WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CALL IT  THE NEW YORKER OF THE SOUTH. WHAT IS IT THAT -- THE NEW  YORKER IS HIGH FLORIDA  LAWSUITENT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY. THE NEW YORKER COMES EVERY WEEK  AND PILES UP. AND ACCORDING TO SOME PEOPLE NO  ONE READS IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: HOW OFTEN DO YOU  PUT OUT THIS THING?
QUARTERLY. SO YOU HAVE TIME TO READ IT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO WORK  REALLY HARD TO LET IT PILE UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
Stephen: WHY IS IT CALLED  "OXFORD AMERICAN"? THAT SOUNDS ENGLISH TO ME.
IT DOES, BUT THERE'S A PLACE  IN MISSISSIPPI CALLED OXFORD,  MISSISSIPPI, AND THAT'S WHERE IT WAS FOUNDED.
Stephen: FAULKNER, RIGHT?
FAWMER IN COUNTRY, RIGHT.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING FOR  A FAWMER IN VIBE HERE? DOES THE MAGAZINE COME WITH  CLIFF NOTES BECAUSE --
WE CAN ARRANGE THAT.
Stephen: TOO MANY NAMES.
THERE ARE A LOT OF NAMES. THE IDEA WAS TO EXPLORE AND  CELEBRATE AND REALLY GET LOST NM  SOUTHERN CULTURE.
Stephen: I'M A SOUTHERN  BOY.
YOU ARE?
Stephen: I'M FROM  CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.
WHICH IS NORTH FROM WHERE WE  SIT [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Stephen: SIR, ALL ROADS  LEAD NORTH FROM CHARLESTON. WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
DEL RIO, TEXAS.
Stephen: NO MEAN TO BURST  YOUR BUBBLE BUT TEXAS IS A GREAT  PLACE, BUT IF YOU ARE FROM THE REAL SOUTH -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- TEXAS IS TEXAS. ASK SOMEONE FROM TEXAS THEY'LL  TELL YOU FROM TEXAS. THEY'LL SAY I'M FROM TEXAS NOT  THE SOUTH IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: IT IS TRUE. I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.
TEXAS IS UNIQUE AND MOST  SOUTHERNERS WOULD LIKE TO EXPEL  TEXAS FROM THE SOUTH. I UNDERSTAND WHY BECAUSE TEXAS  IS IN SOME WAYS THE MOST  EXTREMELY SOUTHERN.
Stephen: IT'S TOO BIG OF A  WEIGHT. IT'S GOT TOO MUCH OF THE OWN  FLAVOR THAT ISN'T THE SOUTH  FLAVOR. FOR INSTANCE, BEEF BARBECUE  RIBS, ABOMB MINIMUMMATION.
A DEGREE. IT HAS TO BE THE PIG.
Stephen: SLOW SMOKED PIG. THANK GOD.
GOTTA BE THE PIG.
Stephen: WE'RE COOL WITH  EACH OTHER.
AND EVEN BETTER IT WOULD BE A  LOUISIANA PULLED PORK MADE INTO  A PATTY AND SEARED. THAT'S THE ULTRA.
Stephen: IT SHOULD BE  PULLED PORK AND SERVED WITH A  MUSTARD SAUCE LIKE S.C.
LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA, RIGHT.
Stephen: WE'LL FIGHT  LATTER. WE'LL STAB EACH OTHER.
OKAY.
Stephen: ONE OF REASONS I  WANTED TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW  IS BECAUSE YOU TALK TO PEOPLE NOT FROM THE SOUTH AND THEY  THINK EVERYBODY FROM THE SOUTH  IS CHANGE CHANGE -- EVERYBODY IS LIKE [SPEAKING QUICKLY IN  SOUTHERN TWANG]
EXACTLY. THAT'S IT.
Stephen: THERE'S SMART  FOLK. BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL LITERATURE  FROM THE SOUTH THAT I HAVE NEVER  READ. [LAUGHTER]
NOT JUST LITERATURE.
Stephen: WHAT ARE PEOPLE  MISSING BY THINKING THE SOUTH IS  A BUNCH OF PIG FARMERS.
THERE ARE PIG FARMERS BUT  IT'S ALSO A PLACE OF GREAT  LITERATURE AND MUSIC. THIS ISSUE IS DEDICATED TO THE  MUSIC OF LOUISIANA WHICH IS SOME  OF THE GREATEST IN THE UNION. JAZZ WAS BORN IN THE SOUTH. THE BLUES, HAD A BABY, IT'S NAME  WAS ROCK 'N' ROLL. IT WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE  SOUTH.
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT  THE SOUTH THAT WAS SO DIFFERENT  THAT ALLOWED FOR JAZZ AND BLUES AND ROCK 'N' ROLL. THERE WAS SOME PA CUELLAR  INSTITUTION THAT MADE THAT  POSSIBLE.
YES. AND OUT AFTER THIS TRAGEDY IS  SLAVERY WE HAVE GIVEN -- WE HAVE  RECEIVED THE GIFT GREAT CULTURE. BECAUSE THE FUSION OF BRITISH  CULTURE WITH THE AFRICAN CULTURE  WITH THE SPANISH AND THE FRENCH IT COMES TOGETHER IN THE  AMERICAN SOUTH.
Stephen: THERE'S A CD THAT  COMES WITH THIS ISSUE AND YOU  CAN PUT THE HEADPHONES ON, PUT THIS IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE AND  YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU ARE IN  LOUISIANA WITH THE OXFORD  AMERICAN.
YOU MIGHT, YEAH ESPECIALLY IF  YOU PUT ON MARDI GRAS BEADS. HAPPY MARDI GRAS, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: THANK YOU, HAPPY  MARDI GRAS. SHOW ME YOUR TITS. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EDITOR OF "THE OXFORD AMERICAN,"  ROGER HODGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
