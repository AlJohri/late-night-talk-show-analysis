(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE RUSSIAN ACTIVISTS WHO ARE VOCAL OPPONENTS OF VLADIMIR PUTIN. I WILL NOT BE SHARING THEIR SUSHI. PLEASE WELCOME --
PUSSY RIOT.
PUSSY RIOT.
PUSSY RIOT.
Stephen: WHAT THEY SAID! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU, NADYA, MASHA. ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT MASHA, WE GOT NADYA AND THEN ANYA, YOU'LL BE TRANSLATING, RIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES.
( translated ): THANK YOU.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN TO AN OLIVE GARDEN YET?
( translated ): HAVEN'T HAD TIME.
Stephen: DON'T, YOU'LL THINK YOU'RE IN ITALY, IT WOULD BE A WASTE. NOW, YOU ARE MEMBERS OF-- PARDON THE EXPRESSION-- PUSSY RIOT. OKAY? YOU WERE ARRESTED IN RUSSIA AND THROWN IN JAIL. WHAT DID YOU DO THAT GOT YOU ARRESTED? [TRANSLATING]
( translated ): WE SANG A FUN SONG IN A CHURCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SO YOU BROKE THE LAW? (LAUGHTER)
( translated ): YES, AND WE BROKE IT MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF FUN SONGS, ONE OF THEM WAS CALLED "PUTIN PISS OFF." (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY, NOW VLADIMIR'S A FRIEND SO I WANT YOU TO -- (LAUGHTER) I'M GOING EDIT OUT ANYTHING BAD YOU SAY ABOUT HIM. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. OKAY? [TRANSLATING] (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT?
( translated ): IT'S OKAY, WE'RE MAKING OUR OWN TAPING RIGHT NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, YOU WILL BE SEARCHED BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE BUILDING. (LAUGHTER)
( translated ): WE'VE HAD TWO YEARS OF PRACTICE HIDING THINGS FROM SEARCHES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE COUPLE OF KIDS. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU WOULD BE GOING AGAINST SOMEONE LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO IS JUST TRYING TO PRESERVE THE PEACE AND BRING RUSSIA INTO A BRIGHTER FUTURE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST VLADIMIR PUTIN? HE'S A STRONG MAN, THAT'S WHAT RUSSIA NEEDS.
( translated ): WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT A BRIGHT FUTURE AND WE DON'T WANT A SHIRTLESS MAN ON A HORSE LEADING US INTO THAT FUTURE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: VLADIMIR AND I GET TOGETHER SHIRTLESS -- (LAUGHTER) -- AND GO HUNTING ALL THE TIME. SOMETIMES WE DON'T EVEN GET AROUND TO THE HUNTING. (LAUGHTER)
( translated ): YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME HANDSOME BOYS WITH YOU. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. HERE IN AMERICA EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE ANTI-GAY PROPAGANDA LAWS BACK IN RUSSIA. HOW BAD HAS IT GOTTEN WITH THE GAY PROPAGANDA? CAN YOU GO ANYWHERE IN RUSSIA WITHOUT GAY PEOPLE TURNING YOU GAY? (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT BAD, EH?
( translated ): IT'S VERY BAD. THEY'RE ABOUT TO MAKE BEING PART OF THE GAY COMMUNITY A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK MANY GAY PEOPLE WILL MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AND STOP BEING GAY? (LAUGHTER)
( translated ): I DON'T KNOW, IN OUR EXPERIENCE IT JUST TURNS THEM ON EVEN MORE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I'VE HEARD THAT. I'VE HEARD THAT.
( translated ): AND THERE'S ALSO A DANGER OF A NEW LAW BEING PASSED AGAINST GAY EXTREMISM.
Stephen: WHAT IS GAY EXTREMISM?
( translated ): IN THE EYES OF OUR GOVERNMENT, IT PROBABLY JUST MEANS BEING PUBLIC ABOUT BEING GAY.
Stephen: SO IT'S NOT LIKE GAY TERRORISM. (LAUGHTER) LIKE NO GLITTER BOMBING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
( translated ): WE DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT, ACTUALLY, ONCE. WE KISSED A FEMALE POLICEWOMAN. THIS WAS EVEN BEFORE PUSSY RIOT, WE MANAGED TO KISS ABOUT 40 OF THEM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND HOW DID THAT GO OVER?
( translated ): IT ACTUALLY WAS VERY FUNNY. THEY WOULD OFTEN TAKE US TO THE SIDE AND SAY "WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS IN PUBLIC?"
Stephen: OH, SO THEY WERE DOWN WITH IT, JUST ON THE D.L.? LISTEN, I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT. WE'VE GOT TO GO TO A COMMERCIAL BREAK WHICH-- DO THEY HAVE COMMERCIAL BREAKS IN RUSSIA?
( translated ): WE ONLY HAVE COMMERCIALS FOR PUTIN THE GREAT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE ONE OF THOSE RIGHT  NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE PUSSY RIOT.
