Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR REJOINING OUR  BROADCAST ALREADY IN PROGRESS. NATION, LONGTIME VIEWERS KNOW I  LOVE MY SPONSORS LIKE I LOVE MY  CHILDREN-- IF MY CHILDREN GAVE ME MONEY. WHRAF LAUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHY I LEAP, LIKE A MOTHER  TIGRESS, TO THEIR DEFENSE IF  ANYONE ATTACKS THEM. I AM ESPECIALLY PROTECTIVE OF  THE COCA-COLA COMPANY'S WHOLE  FAMILY OF PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH IN THIS FAMILY  FANTA'S KINDA THE BLACK SHEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE THE  NEIGHBOR'S KID, HE'S A "DOCTOR." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IN THIS FAMILY, I  ESPECIALLY LOVE VITAMINWATER. OH, THAT REMINDS ME. GOTTA TAKE MY MEDS. MONDAY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHOO! SADLY, AS VITAMINWATER'S PARENT  COMPANY, COCA-COLA IS NOW  EMBROILED IN A LAWSUIT FOR ALLEGEDLY MAKING "DECEPTIVE AND  UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS" THAT  THEIR PRODUCT IS HEALTHY. JUST BECAUSE IT HAS THE WORDS  "VITAMIN" AND "WATER" ON THE  LABEL? COME ON, WE'RE ALL ADULTS. THERE'S NO SUN IN SUNNY D! [ LAUGHTER ] OR PAUL NEWMAN IN FIG NEWMANS--  ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND COCA-COLA'S LAWYERS AGREE  WITH ME. THEY ARGUE THAT "NO CONSUMER  COULD REASONABLY BE MISLED INTO  THINKING VITAMINWATER WAS A HEALTHY BEVERAGE."  EXACTLY. WHAT CONSUMER WOULD REASONABLY  THINK VITAMINWATER IS HEALTHY  JUST BECAUSE THEIR LABELS SAY IT "SUPPORTS YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM"  WILL "GIVE YOUR MORNING SOME  NUTRITION," HELPS "FIGHT FOR YOUR OVERALL HEALTH," AND THEY  HAVE CLAIMED VITAMINWATER  WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASE, EYE DISEASE, AND  PROMOTE HEALTHY JOINTS. AND THEY'RE COMMERCIALS SAY  THIS:
KEEP IT SIMPLE BY DRINK  VITAMINWATER EDGE. IT HELPS SUPPORT A HEALTHY BODY.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, A  HEALTHY BODY. AS LONG AS YOU DEFINE HEALTHY AS  A BACKBOARD-HEADED MUTANT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, THE GROUP SUING COCA-COLA,  THE CENTER FOR SCIENCE IN THE  PUBLIC INTEREST, SAY THAT THE HEALTHY NAME "VITAMINWATER"  , SMALL AMOUNT OF VITAMIN CONTENT  AND  OBSCURES THE PRODUCT'S 33 GRAMS OF SUGAR WHICH IS ALMOST AS MUCH  AS A CAN OF COKE. THOUGH,  ACCORDING A RECENT 1905 STUDY, IS A DELIGHTFUL, PALATABLE AND  HETFUL BEVERAGE. THE CHIEF LITIGATOR STEPHEN  GARDNER WENT SO FAR AS TO CLAIM  THE COCA-COLA COMPANY ADDED VITAMINS TO CRAP? ADDED VITAMINS TO CRAP? THAT IS SLANDEROUS, COCA-COLA  MUST COUNTERSUE AND GIVE ME A  CALL BECAUSE I JUST GOT A GREAT IDEA FOR ENERGY BARS.
