Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FATHER OF THE INTERNET VINT CERF. IS THE AUTHOR OF THE MATRIX RELOADED, IS HE WITH US? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT IN THE MATRIX? (APPLAUSE) I KNOW KARATE (LAUGHTER) DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE IMPACT THIS COULD HAVE? BY THE TIME YOU TURNED IT ON IN 1983 AND SAID, OKAY, IT'S WORKING, DID YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THE IMPACT YOU WOULD HAVE BECAUSE 3 BILLION PEOPLE USE IT, IT'S ONLY GOING TO EXPAND. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WORKING ON NOW AT JET PROPULSION LABORATORIES ESTABLISH AN INTERPLANETARY PROTOCOL? JESUS HAS INFLUENCED A FEW PEOPLE. MOHAMED MADE HIS IMPACT ON THE PLANET, BUDDHA'S DONE A THING OR TWO BUT I ONLY KNOW THOSE THREE BECAUSE I LOOKED IT UP ON WIKIPEDIA (LAUGHTER) SO ARE YOU AND BOB CONN, THE OTHER GUY, ARE YOU TECHNOLOGICAL PROPHETS?
I THINK IT WOULD BE CLOSER TO SAY WE'RE SCIENTISTS, WE'RE EXPERIMENTERS AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEVICE SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK AND NOW WE'RE ENGINEERS AT TRYING TO EXPAND THIS THING, MAKE IT WORK BETTER FOR EVERYBODY. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WHEN HE FIRST DID THE DESIGN, WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY THINGS WOULD BE ON THE INTERNET.
Stephen: HOW MANY THINGS ARE ON THE INTERNET?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW WE'VE RUN OUT OF ADDRESSES FOR THEM. THE PROBLEM IS WE THOUGHT 4.3 BILLION WOULD BE ENOUGH --
Stephen: IS THAT HOW MANY I.P. ADDRESSES THERE ARE?
4.3 BILLION. IT'S A 32-BYTE NUMBER AND THAT'S WHAT WE STARTED WITH. WE RAN OUT OF THE NUMBERS IN 2011 SO WE INVENTED ANOTHER VERSION WITH 128 BYTES OF ADDRESS IN THEM. THEM. I'LL DO THE MATH.
Stephen: GO AHEAD (LAUGHTER) (DOING MATH OUT LOUD)
Stephen: SO IS THAT ENOUGH OF NUMBER BYTES?
WELL, I HOPE SO BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW IS THE TEN TO THE  38th ADDRESSES.
Stephen: AS THE FATHER OF THE INTERNET WOULD YOU LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE COMMENT SECTION ON YAHOO NEWS? VERBAL WAR CRIMES! (LAUGHTER) VINT CERF, THANK YOU FOR GIVING US SOMETHING TO SURF. THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH! VINT CERF, INTERNET EVANGELIST, FATHER OF THE INTERNET! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
