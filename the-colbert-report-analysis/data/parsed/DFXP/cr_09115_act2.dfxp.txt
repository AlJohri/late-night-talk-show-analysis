(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT NEEDS NO  INTRODUCTION. HERE TO INTERVIEW MUSIC LEGEND  PAUL McCARTNEY IS STEPHEN  COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU! PAUL, GOOD SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU. WHAT A PLEASURE.
NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN  TOGETHER FOR FOUR YEARS.
NO.
Stephen: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN GOOD, THANK YOU. AND YOU?
Stephen: LAST TIME WE TALKED  I WASN'T THAT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR  WORK. (LAUGHTER)
I REMEMBER. YEAH.
Stephen: I HAVE SINCE THEN,  THOUGH, BONED UP ON MY McCARTNEY  AND JESUS CAN YOU WRITE SOME  DIZZYS! I MEAN, SERIOUSLY! SERIOUSLY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW, WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THIS  WHOLE BEATLES SIDE PROJECT YOU WORKED ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT  THE NEW -- THE ALBUM, THE  REMASTERED REISSUED ALBUM YOU'VE GOT OUT NOW CALLED "WINGS OVER  AMERICA: 1976 TOUR OF THE  WORLD."  IT'S THE AMERICA LEG OF IT. (APPLAUSE)  NOW THIS WAS THE FIFTH  NUMBER-ONE ALBUM YOU HAD AS  WINGS.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  WALK ME UP TO THAT SPOT. BECAUSE YOU LEAVE THE BEATLES,  OKAY? YOU'VE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS  VERY SUCCESSFULLY WITH A GUY  NAMED JOHN-- I KNOW THE FEELING. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW THAT? (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUT YOU START YOUR  OWN THING. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE? DID IT FEEL LIKE YOU HAD TO  START FROM SCRATCH AFTER YOU  LEFT THE BEATLES?
YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THE SAME  THING AGAIN SO I WANTED TO FORM  A NEW BAND AND TRY AND DO IT ALL AGAIN ONLY DIFFERENT.
Stephen: THERE HAD TO HAVE  BEEN SOME ROUGH PATCHES AT THE  BEGINNING.
YEAH, THERE WERE.
Stephen: LET'S RELIVE THOSE  BAD DAYS. WHAT WAS IT LIKE? WAS IT LIKE McCARTNEY AND RAM? WHAT WAS IT LIKE?
WELL, YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY,  STEPHEN --.
Stephen: PAUL --
WE DECIDED TO TRY AND DO IT  FROM THE GROUND UP RATHER THAN  DO A BIG SUPERGROUP THING SO WE KNEW NOTHING AND WE HAD TO JUST  LEARN IT ALL AGAIN, HOW TO BE A  BAND AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WAS -- IT WAS A GRIND. THE  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SORRY TO HEAR THAT. SORRY TO HEAR THAT. YOU ACTUALLY -- I UNDERSTAND AT  ONE POINT YOU WERE ACTUALLY  DRIVING TO COLLEGE GIGS IN ENGLAND IN A VAN.
UH-HUH. YEAH.
Stephen: WHY? (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE PAUL McCARTNEY, MAN!
YEAH, I ASK MYSELF THAT  QUESTION.
Stephen: THE OTHER BAND MATES  HAVE THEIR SOCKS UP ON THE  DASHBOARD?
WE HAD THE KIDS AND THE DOGS  AND THE BAND ALL IN THE VAN AND  WE LITERALLY DID DRIVE UP THE  MOTORWAY. WE DIDN'T HAVE A BIG BOOKED AND  WE DIDN'T HAVE A HOTEL.
Stephen: WAIT? SO YOU'D JUST SHOW UP AT A  COLLEGE AND SAY "WOULD ANYONE  LIKE TO HEAR ME PLAY"? (LAUGHTER)
WE SAID "HAVE YOU GOT A  STUDENTS' UNION?"  AND THEY'D SAY "YEAH."  WE'D SAY "CAN WE SEE THE GUY FROM THE STUDENTS' UNION?"  AND THEN THE GUY WOULD COME OUT  AND LOOK AT ME AND SAY -- AND I'D SAY "CAN WE PLAY FOR YOU  TOMORROW?"  I TELL YOU, THAT'S HOW IT  HAPPENED.
Stephen: IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR  YOU TO BE PRODUCING MUSIC,  CREATING MUSIC AND BE TRAVELING AROUND WITH YOUR WIFE. WHY WAS THAT IMPORTANT FOR YOU  TO BE WITH LINDA IN THE BAND? WAS THAT A WAY TO MAKE A BETTER  MARRIAGE?
NO, IT'S JUST I LIKED HER. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A  GOOD IDEA. YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF GRIEF  ABOUT IT. MICK JAGGER SAID "WHY WOULD YOU  WANT YOUR OLD LADY IN YOUR  BAND?"  YOU EVER SEE HIM NOW AND MOCK HIM FOR LOOKING LIKE AN OLD  LADY? (LAUGHTER)
I DO, YEAH.
Stephen: "BAND ON THE RUN" TO  ME IS THE ALBUM OF THE 1970s. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE THING THAT AMAZES ME ABOUT  IT IS THAT YOU RECORDED IT ON AN 8-FLAK LAGOS, NIGERIA.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY?
WHY?
Stephen: HOW ALOFT DID THIS  VAN GET? (LAUGHTER)
THE FASHION WAS TO NOT GO TO  SORT OF LONDON STUDIOS ANYMORE  ANDED TO GO SOMEWHERE EXOTIC. SO I ASKED MY RECORD COMPANY--  WHICH WAS E.M.I.-- I SAID "CAN I  HAVE A LIST OF YOUR STUDIOS? I HEAR YOU HAVE THEM ALL OVER  THE WORLD."  SURE ENOUGH, THEY GAVE ME A LIST  AND THERE WAS LIKE BEIJING, RIO DE JANEIRO. AND I CHOSE LAGOS.
Stephen: FOR THE CLIMATE OR  THE CORRUPTION?
THE CLIMATE AND THE DISEASE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE TRUTH IS WE -- WE WENT  AND WE DID IT. WHEN I GOT BACK THERE WAS A NOTE  THAT I SHOULD HAVE READ BEFORE I  WENT AWAY FROM THE RECORD COMPANY GUY SAYING "ADVISE YOU  DON'T GO TO LAGOS, OUTBREAK OF  CHOLERA."  (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: WOW. THAT'S A CLOSE SHAVE.
A CLOSE SHAVE, MAN.
Stephen: NOW, THE CONCERT,  THE FINAL CONCERT OF THE WORLD  TOUR WAS IN SEATTLE AND THAT'S ON A D.V.D. THAT YOU CAN GET  CALLED "ROCK SHOW."  YOU GUYED STOPPED PERFORMING AS THE BEATLES. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO BE BACK  ON STAGE AFTER SO MANY YEARS  PERFORMING FOR A LIVE AUDIENCE-- ESPECIALLY ONES THAT COULD HEAR  WHAT YOU WERE PLAYING?"  (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE THAT WAS A REAL PROBLEM, WASN'T IT?
IN THE BEATLES IT WAS, YEAH. YOU COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.
Stephen: MY SISTER SAW YOU  GUYS AT WASHINGTON STADIUM AND  SHE SAID -- YOU MIGHT REMEMBER  HER. SHE WAS THE TALL, BANGS. SCREAMING YOUR NAME. EXACTLY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT DID YOU STOP PLAYING BECAUSE  YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF OR  THEY COULDN'T HEAR YOU?
THAT WAS KIND OF THE REASON  AT THE TIME, YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU GET TIRED  OF TOURING AND WE HAD A  RELENTLESS SCHEDULE.
Stephen: IT'S PRONOUNCED SK  YOU'LL GET YOURSELF TARGETED BY  THE N.S.A. WITH THAT SHH-EDULE STUFF, MY FRIEND.
SHH-EDULE IS CORRECT. SKE-JULE IS NOT CORRECT.
Stephen: WE'LL SEE HOW WHAT  THE EDITS DO. (LAUGHTER)
SO I'VE COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN  WHERE I WAS.
Stephen: YOU WERE SHHH-EDULE. YOU HAD A RELENTLESS SCHEDULE.
WE WERE TOURING ON THE TIME. IT WAS A TERRIBLE SKEJ HCHLYULE  WE WERE ON.
Stephen: NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SO IT GOT PRETTY BORING AND  SO -- TOWARDS THE END THE  SCREAMING, YOU COULDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND, YOU  KNOW, WE WERE, AFTER ALL,  MUSICIANS, HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL  IDEA. (LAUGHTER)  SO NOW WE WERE JUST KIND OF  PUPPETS GETTING SCREAMED AT AND  WE DECIDED TO, YOU KNOW, CALL IT A DAY.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  EVOLUTION OF THE BEATLES BECAUSE  I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ANYBODY WHO IS BLOWN AWAY BY IS  WHAT GREW YOU GUYS SOUND LIKE IN  '64 AND WHAT YOU GUYS SOUNDED LIKE BY '69. DID YOU TRY TO CHANGE YOUR SOUND  THAT QUICKLY?
YOU KNOW, WE WERE LEARNING. AND YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, ME  AND JOHN WERE NEW TO SONG  WRITING SO THE FIRST SONGS WE WROTE WERE REALLY ALL AIMED AT  THE FANS. THEY'RE LIKE KIND OF "THANK YOU,  GIRL FROM ME TO YOU."  (LAUGHTER)  "PLEASE, PLEASE ME." (LAUGHTER)  "P.S., I LOVE YOU."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WOW, SO YOU KNEW  YOUR AUDIENCE. YOU KNEW YOUR AUDIENCE. AND WHAT POINT DID YOU FIND  EITHER THE COURAGE OR JUST THE  NEW FEELING THAT YOU SAID "I'M NOT GOING TO WRITE FOR THAT  OTHER PERSON, I'M GOING TO WRITE  FOR MYSELF?"
DRUGS.
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD IN  SERIOUSLY? NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S  PRACTICALLY LEGAL NOW.
IT'S TRUE. THE ONE THING ABOUT THE BEATLES,  WE NEVER WANTED TO MAKE THE SAME  SONG OR THE SAME RECORD SO WE LITERALLY WERE GOING INTO THE  STUDIO WITH RINGO AND SAYING  "DID YOU USE THAT SNARE DRUM ON THE LAST TRACK?"  HE'D SAY "YEAH."  SO WE SAID "YOU HAVE TO CHANGE  IT."
Stephen: CHANGE THE ACTUAL  DRUM?
TRACK TO TRACK NOT ALBUM TO  ALBUM. SO THAT'S WHY THERE WAS A LOT OF  -- YOU LIKE THAT?
Stephen: I DID. DID YOU JUST WRITE A BEATLES  HIT? (LAUGHTER)  WHY WOULD YOU -- SO YOU WOULD  PLAY ANYTHING THAT WAS LAYING  AROUND?
YOU PLAY ON PACKING CASES,  YOU GET THE MIC IN, YOU JUST  WOULD MESS WITH SOUNDS SO THIS WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING THE ABILITY  TO EXPERIMENT AND MESS WITH THIS  AND TRY A NEW SNARE DRUM, TRY A TOM TOM INSTEAD OF IT. THE OTHER GOOD THING ABOUT THE  BEATLES IS THERE WAS AN  INCREDIBLE DEMOCRACY. IF ONE OF US DIDN'T LIKE  SOMETHING WE WERE DOING IT WAS  VOTED OUT. SO, YOU KNOW, WE COULD THINK  WE'D WRITTEN THE GREATEST SONG  EVER BUT IF RINGO DIDN'T LIKE IT --  (LAUGHTER)  TRUE.
Stephen: SO THERE'S SORT OF A  PILE LIKE "NO, THESE A REALLY  GOOD, NOBODY KNOWS HOW GOOD MY STUFF IS."  DID THAT PILE SORT OF BUILD UP  NEXT TO YOU? NO? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU KNOW -- NO, I THINK  THE THING IS BECAUSE WE KNEW  WHAT WAS GOING TO GET VOTED OUT. YOU HAD TO KIND OF WRITE  SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ALL  LIKE.
Stephen: YOU'VE HAD 71 TOP  TEN HITS, OKAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AT WHAT POINT IN YOUR CAREER DID  YOU SAY TO YOURSELF "WELL, I THINK I MIGHT BE BETTER THAN  ANYONE ON THE PLANET AT WHAT I  DO"? DID IT EVER DOUR YOU THAT,  GODDAMNIT, I'M REALLY GOOD. OR WERE YOU ALWAYS SAYING "I'M  NOT SURE HOW GOOD I AM."
WELL, YOU TRY TO BE MODEST. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND HOW DID THAT  WORK OUT?
NOT EASY. NOT TOO EASY, NO. YOU KNOW, I -- I DO PINCH MYSELF  SOMETIMES THINKING I'VE DONE  PRETTY GOOD.
Stephen: YES, YEAH, I WOULD  SAY SO. I WOULD SAY SO. ARE THERE SONGS YOU WISH YOU'D  WRITTEN -- NOT WITH THE BEATLES  BUT SONGS YOU WISH YOU'D WRITTEN FOR YOUR TIME? LIKE EVEN -- LIKE "TIN PAN  ALLEY" VERY SIMPLE SONGS LIKE  THAT?
YEAH, YEAH. "CHEEK TO CHEEK" I LIKE. YOU KNOW THAT ONE?
Stephen: I DO.
I LIKE THAT.
Stephen:  ♪ WE'RE OUT TOGETHER DANCING  CHEEK TO CHEEK ♪  DID I JUST SING WITH YOU? I SANG WITH PAUL McCARTNEY. DID I JUST SING WITH PAUL  McCARTNEY.
(BOTH)  ♪ HEAVEN, I'M IN HEAVEN  ♪ AND MY HEART BEATS SO THAT I  COULD HARDLY SPEAK ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ♪ WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER  DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK ♪  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: VERY NICE. I SMELL HIT. WE'VE GOT ALL THIS EQUIPMENT  HERE. WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT DOING SOME  MUSIC FOR US, PLEASE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'D LOVE TO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT'S AN ABSOLUTE JOY  A PLEASURE. LOOK AT THAT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WINGS OVER AMERICA C.D. REISSUE. IF WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH PAUL  McCARDNY! COME ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
