Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST IS THE ACCLAIMED AUTHOR OF "FLASH BOYS," "THE BLIND SIDE," AND "THE BIG SHORT." I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT ADJECTIVE AND NOUN HE PAIRS NEXT. PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL LEWIS!  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, MICHAEL! GOOD TO SEE YOU!
GOOD TO SEE YOU!
Stephen: I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DRESSING FOR BOCA RATON TONIGHT (LAUGHTER) YOU LOOK SO SUMMERY, I WANT TO HAVE A GIN AND TONIC SITTING ACROSS FROM THAT OUTFIT.
I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT YOU AT YOUR EASE.
Stephen: I'M TOTALLY AT EASE. >>YOU'RE ALWAYS A LITTLE TENSE
Stephen: YOU'RE A FRIEND OF THE SHOW, THIS IS YOUR FOURTH TIME BACK. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: EVERYBODY WHO WATCHES THE SHOW KNOWS YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF FLASH BOYS, THE BIG SHORT, THE BLIND SIDE,  MONEY BALL, AMONG MANY OTHERS, ALL BEST SELLERS AND YOU'RE HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL, THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF YOUR FIRST BOOK "LIAR'S POKER:  RISING THROUGH THE WRECKAGE ON WALL STREET." WHAT HAS CHANGED 25 YEARS LATER ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE GO-GO '80s. YOU KNOW, REAGAN, MORNING IN AMERICA, DEFEATING THE EVIL EMPIRE, BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY, YOU KNOW, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE.
YES. SO YOUR QUESTION IS?
Stephen: WHAT HAS CHANGED ON WALL STREET OR HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?
NOT MUCH. I TELL YOU WHAT'S CHANGED, IT'S GOTTEN MUCH BETTER AT DISGUISING WHAT IT'S DOING, AND IT'S HARDER TO UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE OUTSIDE THAN IT WAS.
Stephen: COMPUTERS DO A LOT OF THE TRADING NOW, DON'T THEY?
YES, IN THE STOCK MARKET, ALL OF IT.
Stephen: DO THEY DO MOST OF THE COCAINE, TOO? (APPLAUSE)
JUST THE STRIPPERS.
Stephen: YEAH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE A VERY, LIKE, JAUNDICED VIEW OF WALL STREET. YOU WORKED THERE --
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A JAUNDICED VIEW.
Stephen: YOU DON'T? NO, I HAVE -- WELL, WHEN I WORKED THERE, I HAD KIND OF A LOVING VIEW OF IT.
Stephen: THEN WHY DID YOU LEAVE, BABY? COULDN'T RUN WITH THE BIG DOGS? WHY DID YOU GET OUT? TOO HOT FOR YOU? WHY DID YOU LEAVE?
I THINK I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT IT, TO START WITH.
Stephen: YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION OF ANALYZING, CRITICIZING IT.
WRITING A STORY ABOUT IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.
Stephen: C'MON, MAN THIS IS AN INDICTMENT OF WALL STREET.
NO, ACTUALLY I THINK THE BIG SHORT AND FLASH BOYS  ARE INDICTMENTS OF WALL STREET.
Stephen: I HAVEN'T READ ANY OF THEM
IT'S AMAZING, YOU WOULD HAVE DONE VERY WELL ON WALL STREET BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CENTRAL QUALITY OF A WALL STREET PERSON.
Stephen: BALLS. (APPLAUSE) WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED? IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU NEED?
YOU'RE OFTEN WRONG BUT SELDOM IN DOUBT.
Stephen: I MAY BE FACTUALLY INACCURATE BUT I GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT FELT RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT, AND YOU'RE TOTALLY SURE OF YOURSELF.
Stephen: I'M ALL IN ALL THE TIME. BALLS TO THE WALL,  MY FRIEND! >>THAT'S RIGHT, SO EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK,  YOU HAVE A VERY CLEAR OPINION OF IT.
Stephen: YOUR ELIZABETH WARRENS OUT THERE SAY THE STOCK MARKET IS RIGGED.
I SAID IT FIRST.
Stephen: REALLY? FLASH BOYS IS ABOUT THIS. I THINK THE STOCK MARKET IS RIGGED. IT'S A VERY WEIRD MARKET. COMPUTERS ARE DOING THE TRADING BUT SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS GET TO SEE THE PRICES BEFORE OTHERS, PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS AND YOUR COMPUTER SEES THE PRICES LAST.
Stephen: HOW DO I GET ONE OF THOSE OTHER COMPUTERS?
IT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU NEED TO KNOW PEOPLE.
Stephen: DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW WALL STREET WORKS? DOES ANYBODY KNOW? BECAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. I LOOK AT, LIKE, THE NEWS -- THIS IS MY SYMBOL FOR NEWS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I LOOK AT ALL THE NEWS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THE DOW IS AT 17,005. THAT'S WHAT IT CLOSED AT TODAY. 17,005 DOW POINTS, DOW LINKS. WHATEVER THOSE ARE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WHATEVER THOSE ARE. IS THAT GOOD FOR ME THAT IT IS THERE AT 17-5?
DO YOU OWN SOME OF IT?
Stephen: I THINK SO. WELL, THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S A VERY NICE THING.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH!
Stephen: AREN'T I GETTING RIPPED OFF BY THE GUYS WHO GET THERE FIRST?
YEAH BUT WHEN YOU TRADE IN THE MARKET, IT'S PENNIES. THE BEAUTY OF THE RIGGING IS YOU DON'T FEEL IT MUCH IF YOU'RE JUST AN ORDINARY PERSON.
Stephen: REALLY? SO THEY'RE SHAVING THE SKIN OFF MY BACK,  SO LITTLE THAT I  FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST DERMABRASION?
IT'S LIKE A PARTIAL ENEMA.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A PARTIAL ENEMA? YEAH.
Stephen: JUST ENOUGH! IT JUST FEELS CLEANSING!
Stephen: WOW! LITERALLY, THAT MEANS THEY'RE LITERALLY DOUCHE BAGS. (APPLAUSE) I HAVE AN IDEA.  DO YOU WANT TO PLAY LIARS POKER?
SURE. WHAT ARE WE --
Stephen: HERE WE GO. SO YOU LIE TO EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW MANY NUMBERS YOU HAVE  IN THE SERIAL NUMBERS ON A BILL, UNTIL YOU CALL THE OTHER PERSON DO YOU WANT TO START OR ME?
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FIRST HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BILL?
Stephen: I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS BILL. YOU SWEAR?
Stephen: YEAH. YOU WANT TO BET ANYTHING? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BET?
WE SHOULD RAISE THE STAKES.
Stephen: $10 MILLION. NO TEARS.  (APPLAUSE)
I WAS THINKING IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS --
Stephen: LET'S DO THIS [BLEEP], MICHAEL.
HOW ABOUT $1,000 TO THE CHARITY OF YOUR CHOICE?
Stephen: $1,000 TO THE CHARITY OF OUR CHOICE, OK (APPLAUSE)
DO YOU WANT TO START?
Stephen: I'LL START, SURE. I'LL SAY THERE'S THREE 2s.
THREE 9s.
Stephen: MAN, YOU JUMPED IT. YOU JUMPED IT. I'LL CALL YOU ON THAT.
I GOT ONE.
Stephen: I GOT NONE. $1,000! MICHAEL LEWIS!
I TOLD YOU!
Stephen: WHAT?
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T ANY GOOD AT IT! THAT'S WHY I LEFT. I SUCK!
Stephen: YOU ENJOY CUTTING THAT CHECK TO THE N.R.A., MY FRIEND! MICHAEL LEWIS, "LIAR'S POKER"! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
