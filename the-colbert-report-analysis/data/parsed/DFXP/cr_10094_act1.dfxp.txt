Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA. NATION, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE WE AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS HAD OUR DIFFERENCES. YOU SAY POTATO, AND I SAY WHO YOU CALLING A POTATO IS IS IT BECAUSE I'M IRISH? YOU'RE A RACIST. I'M HAPPY TO SAY ALL OUR RACIAL CONFLICTS ARE BEHIND US. AS THE SAYING GOES THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG BUT BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE.
A HISTORIC RULING FROM THE SUPREME COURTS COULD SPELL THE END OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. THE 6-2 RULE UPHOLDS A MICHIGAN AMENDMENT BANNING THE USE OF RACE IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS.
Stephen:  FINALLY, THIS DECISION ENDS THE UNFAIR PRACTICE OF ADMITTING STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR RACE AND ALLOWS MORE STUDENTS TO BE ADMITTED BASED ON IF THEIR PARENTS WENT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE DON'T NEED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BECAUSE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IS OFFICIALLY OVER. DON'T BELIEVE ME? JUST ASK THESE OTHER WHITE PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ).
THE DREAM OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS-- HAS BEEN REALIZED. IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME, BUT WE-- I WOULD SAY WE'VE ARRIVED.
THIS IS A SCENE THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING WISHED FOR. HE WANTED THIS DAY TO COME. HE WANTED THE LAW OF THE LAND TO FINALLY BACK OFF AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T NEED THIS, BECAUSE THERE IS EQUALITY
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, AFRICAN AMERICANS. DR. KING SAID HE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT TO THE PROMISED LAND WITH YOU, BUT THESE GUYS DID AND THEY'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE M.L.K. SAID HIMSELF AT THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON-- I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY THE SONS OF FORMER SLAVES AND THE SONS OF FORMER SLAVE OWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT TOGETHER AT THE TABLE OF BROTHERHOOD UNLESS THERE HAPPENS TO BE ANOTHER SLAVE OWNER'S SON WHO IS SIMILARLY QUALIFIED THAT HE SHOULD TAKE THE SLAVE KID'S SEAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT QUOTAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). GREAT MAN. OF COURSE, THESE DAYS THERE'S STILL ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO ATTACK-- WHITE GUYS. SURPRISE! CASE IN POINT, NEVADA RANCHER AND EXTRA FROM "SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT," CLIVEN BUNDY. I KNOW, I LIKE HIM, TOO. FREQUENT VIEWERS OF MY SHOW KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU ABOUT CLIVEN FOR WEEKS. BUT HERE'S THE STORY. BUNDY'S CATTLE WERE SEIZED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT UNDER THE FLIMSY EXCUSE THAT HE'S GRAZED HIS CATTLE ON FEDERAL LAND FOR DECADES AND OWES $1 MILLION IN GRAZING FEES. $1 MILLION TO LET COWS EAT. WHAT ARE THEY GROWING IN THAT DESERT, LOBSTER TAILS? BUT BUNDY HAS A SIMPLE EXPLANATION FOR NOT PAYING.
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS EVEN EXISTING. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  OKAY, YOU CAN'T PAY A GOVERNMENT IF IT DOESN'T EXIST. ESPECIALLY NOT WITH THE MONEY THAT IT ISSUED. ... ( LAUGHTER ) BY BRAVELY STANDING AGAINST THE FORCES OF PAYING YOUR BILLS, BUNDY BECAME A HERO TO CONSERVATIVES LIKE SEAN HANNITY WHO TURNED BUNDY'S 10 GALLON HAT UP TO 11.
MY NEXT GUEST IS A RANCHER WAGING A BATTLE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. BACK WITH US IS CLIVEN BUNDY. BACK WITH US IS CLIVEN BUNDY. AND BACK WITH US TONIGHT TO RESPOND IN A HANNITY EXCLUSIVE IS RANCHER CLIVEN BUNDY. CLIVEN, I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU AS THE CONTROVERSY IS UNFOLDING. YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SEEM LIKE REALLY NICE PEOPLE.
Stephen:  MAN, HANNITY ATE UP THAT STORY SO HARD, BUNDY SHOULD HAVE CHARGED HIM GRAZING FEES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND THANKS, THANKS TO SEAN'S SYMPATHETIC COVERAGE, ARMED PATRIOTS FLOCKED TO BUNDY'S RANCH TO DEFEND HIS RIGHTS.
WE WERE ACTUALLY STRATEGIZING TO PUT ALL THE WOMEN UP AT THE FRONT. IF THEY'RE GOING TO START SHOOTING, IT WILL BE WOMEN THAT WILL BE TELEVISED ALL ACROSS THE WORLD GETTING SHOT BY THESE ROGUE FEDERAL OFFICERS. OFFICERS.
Stephen:  NOW, THAT'S NOT AS MONSTROUS AS IT SOUNDS. I'M SURE THEY WERE GOING TO PROTECT THE WOMEN WITH A LINE OF CHILDREN. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, NO SURPRISE, THE FEDS DID NOT HAVE THE SACK TO SHOOT THROUGH A LADY LINE, SO THEY PACKED IT IN. AND IN THAT MOMENT OF VICTORY AGAINST AN ENCROACHING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, CLIVEN BUNDY BECAME MORE THAN JUST A MAN.
THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS FOR RANCHER CLIVEN BUNDY, ALL VOWING TO STAND BEHIND A MAN WHO HAS BECOME THEIR HERO.
A SAVIOR, IF YOU WILL, OR A SYMBOL OF RURAL AMERICA STANDING UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS A HERO, A FOLK HERO IF YOU WILL.
Stephen:  OH, I WILL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND LIKE EVERY FOLK HERO, HE DESERVES A FOLK SONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ HIS NAME WAS CLIVEN BUNDY A OF BUNKERVILLE, NEVADA. ♪ IF YOU DON'T KNOW HIS STORY I THINK YOU REALLY OUGHTTA. ♪ BACK IN 1993, THE FEDS DEMAND GRAZING FEES ON PUBLIC LAND THE BUNDY PLAN SINCE THE 1870s. BUNDY PLAN SINCE THE 1870s. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ♪ NEVADA STATE DECREE FROM 1953 GAVE FEDERAL AUTHORITY OVER ALL STATE PUBLIC PROPERTY. ♪ AS STATED IF THE GUADALUPE-HIDALGO TREATY ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT CLIVEN COULDN'T UNDERSTAND, WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO PAY FOR LAND? THIS LAND BELONGS TO YOU AND ME. THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD SEAN HANNITY. ♪ THIS IS THE BALLAD OF CLIVEN BUNDY. TAKE IT.
I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE MORE THING I KNOW ABOUT THE NEGRO.
Stephen:  OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THE SONG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). UNFORTUNATELY, NOTHING RHYMES WITH NEGRO. OKAY, LET'S SEE, WHERE-- WHERE WERE WE? OH, YES, CLIVEN BUNDY. ( LAUGHTER ) CLIVEN, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN BRETHREN?
THEY ABORT THEIR-- THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN. THEY PUT THEIR YOUNG MEN IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY NEVER LEARNED HOW TO PICK COTTON. AND I'VE OFTEN WONDERED ARE THEY BETTER OFF ENSLAVED, PICKING COTTON.
Stephen:  CALM DOWN. THAT'S NOT RACIST. THAT'S BEING EXISTENT. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL TO BELIEVE THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. I'M SURE HE HAD A CHANCE TO CLARIFY THE STATEMENT.
ARE THEY HAPPIER NOW UNDER THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY SYSTEM THAN THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE SLAVES AND THEY WAS ABLE TO HAVE THEIR FAMILY STRUCTURE TOGETHER AND THE CHICKENS AND GARDENS, AND THE PEOPLE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO?
Stephen:  WELL, THAT CERTAINLY MAKES IT CRYSTAL CLEAR. HE LEFT THE CHICKENS OUT THE FIRST TIME. THEY REALLY TIE THE WHOLE IDEA TOGETHER. THE POINT IS, THIS MAN IS A VICTIM OF RACISM, AS IT MADE CLEAR ON THE BUNDY FACEBOOK PAGE SAYING, "CLIVEN IS A GOOD MAN. HE LOVES ALL PEOPLE. HE IS NOT A RACIST MAN. HE WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR EVERYONE." OKAY, HE WANTS WHAT'S BEST FOR EVERYONE. AND HE'S JUST WONDERING IF FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S SLAVERY. ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT A CRIME TO WONDER NOW? AND, FOLKS, MY ONE REGRET HERE IS THAT I DID NOT EMBRACE CLIVEN BUNDY SOONER, LIKE SEAN HANNITY DID, YOU KNOW, REALLY DRAW HIM TO MY BOSOM, TO LINK US INEXTRABLY,  TO HANG HIM AROUND MY NECK LIKE SOME KIND OF LUCKY DEAD SEA BIRD. BUT YOU BEAT ME TO IT, SEAN. YOU'RE GOOD, BUDDY. YOU'RE GOOD. THANKS TO YOUR NONSTOP SUPPORT OF COVERAGE OF BUNDY, NOW WHEN ANYONE THINKS OF FOLKS WHO HAVE INSIGHT INTO THE NEGRO, THEY'LL THINK OF SEAN HANNITY. I MEAN, THESE TWO-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THESE TWO GO TOGETHER TO LIKE KU AND KLUX. I MEAN-- SALUTE YOU, SEAN. I SALUTE YOU FOR BRAVELY STANDING BY A MAN WHOSE ONLY CRIME WAS BREAKING FEDERAL LAW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
