(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH GLENN GREENWALD, THE INTOOK NO PLACE TO HIDE. OKAY, WHAT ELSE IS IN THIS BOOK. YOU'VE GOT NEW REVELATIONS IN THIS BOOK. WHAT ARE SO THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO SHOCK MY CONSCIOUS.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IS THE NSA MADE ALL KINDS OF CLAIMS OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND NOT DOING AND WE HAVE MADE OTHER CLAIMS AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE IN CONFLICT SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS PUBLISH A DOCUMENT THAT THE NSA CREATED WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SPEAKING IN PRIVATE. THAT THEY THOUGHT NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. SO MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS THEY DESCRIBE THEIR OBJECTIVES AND MISSIONS IS WILDLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SAY IN PUBLIC SO THERE IS ONE DOCUMENT THAT SAYS OUR COLLECTIVE POSTURE IS COLLECT IT ALL, SNIFF IT ALL, PROCESS IT ALL, EXPLOIT IT ALL. NOT COLLECT THE COMMUNICATION OF TERRORISTS OR PEOPLE DOING BAD THINGS, COLLECT IT ALL. THEY COLLECT BILLIONS, SNIFF IT ALL, EXPLOIT ALL.
PROCESS IT ALL.
Stephen: WOW.
AND THEY COLLECT BILLIONS, BILLIONS WITH A B OF E-MAILS AND TELEPHONE CALLS EVERY SINGLE DAY. SO THEY DO THINGS LIKE IF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD BUY ROUTERS WHICH IS FROM AMERICAN COMPANIES THEY LITERALLY PHYSICALLY-- TAKE THE PRODUCT OUT OF THE MAIL, OPEN UP THE PACKAGE, STICK A BACK DOOR DEVICE INTO IT AND RESEAL IT THE FACTORY PRODUCT AND SEND IT ON TO THE UNWITTING USER.
Stephen: INTERNET ROUTER, A SWITCH, A SERVER, THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSING THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT OF DOING FOR YEARS AND URGING PEOPLE NOT TO BUY CHINESE PRODUCTS WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN DOING SO PEOPLE WILL BUY AMERICAN PRODUCTS THAT THEY CAN INVADE.
Stephen: SO IF I, IF MY NET GEAR ROUTER ISN'T WORKING ONE DAY I CAN JUST CALL THE NSA FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE?
THEY PROBABLY CAME FROM THERE SO IT'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT IT DID. SO MAYBE THEY CAN HELP YOU WITH IT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. SO YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES ANY MORE. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING, YOU LIVE IN BRAZIL.
I DO.
Stephen: THEY DO TERRIBLE THINGS. THE UNITED STATES MAY COLLECT ALL OF OUR E-MAILS BUT THEY TAKE ALL OF YOUR BODY HAIR. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING SHADY ABOUT THAT.
THAT IS THE NEXT BOOK.
Stephen: THAT WILL SELL A LOT.
THERE ARE PICTURES AND EVERYTHING.
Stephen: YOU SAID THERE ARE MORE STORIES COMING. IS THERE ANYTHING AS BIG AND AS JUICY AS HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED?
I GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THE STORY THAT IS THE BIGGEST ONE THAT WILL MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT AND WILL SHAPE HOW THE EVENTS OF THE LAST TEN MONTHS ARE VIEWED BY HISTORY IS THE STORY ON WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY WORK THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE READY WITHIN FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUT.
IT IS ONE OF THE MISSING PIECES IS ON WHOM IS THE NSA SPYING IN AMERICA, WHO ARE THEY TARGETING, FOR WHAT PURPOSE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE DECLARING TO BE SUFFICIENT THREATS THAT IT WARRANTS READING THEIR E-MAILS AND WHAT IS THE PATTERN OF PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TARGETED. ARE THESE POLITICAL DISSIDENT, CRITICS OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY OR TERRORIST, THAT IS THE REPORTING THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE.
Stephen: IS IT GOOD NEWS?
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO PREVIEW BUT I THINK YOU CAN ASSUME THAT IF I THINK IT'S THE BIGGEST STORY THAT WILL SAY HOW IT GETS REMEMBERED THAT WILL ARE VOLUME INTERESTING REVELATIONS THAT WE ARE WORKING AS HARD AND FAST AS WE CAN TO GET PUBLISHED AND LOTS OF OTHER STORIES THAT REMAIN FROM THE ARCHIVES AS WELL.
Stephen: GLENN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. PLEASE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE START YOUR CAR FOR A WHILE, ALL RIGHT? GLENN GREENWALD NO PLACE TO HIDE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
