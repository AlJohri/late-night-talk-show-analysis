(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CO-FOUNDER OF TWITTER! I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM! PLEASE WELCOME BIZ STONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (MUSIC) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH! GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.
Stephen: AS THE PEOPLE, I'M SURE KNOW, YOU'RE THE CO-INVENTER AND CO-FOUNDER OF TWITTER WHICH NOW HAS OVER 230 MILLION ACTIVE USERS. YOU HAVE BEEN NAMED ONE OF "TIME MAGAZINE'S" MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE, ENTREPRENEUR OF THE DECADE BY INK MAGAZINE, AND HAVE A BOOK THINGS A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME: CONFESSIONS OF A CREATIVE MIND. WHAT DID THE BIRD TELL YOU? THAT'S SOMETIMES A SIGN OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. WHAT IS A CREATIVE MIND?
THIS IS A BOOK I STARTED TEN YEARS AGO AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
Stephen: WOO WHOO! OXFORD UNIVERSITY, SMARTY PANTS! GO AHEAD.
I STARTED GIVING THIS LECTURE AND I STARTED GETTING INVITED TO DO IT LOTS OF OTHER PLACES, AND I FOUND THAT IT RESONATED WITH PEOPLE -- KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALL THE WAY TO CEOs. THEY WOULD COME UP AFTERWARDS AND SAY, YOU KNOW, THIS PART OF THE LECTURE REALLY GAVE ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THIS OR THAT. SO WHEN SOMEONE SUGGESTED I WRITE A BOOK, I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.
Stephen: I WILL SAY, NOT A SINGLE CHAPTER IN THIS BOOK IS LESS THAN 140 CHARACTERS LONG. YOU, SIR, ARE A HYPOCRITE (LAUGHTER) YOU STARTED A NEW APP CALLED JELLY.
YES.
Stephen: THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER TO DO WHAT?
IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, NO ONE HAS REALLY COMPLETELY REIMAGINED THE WAY THAT WE GET ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS. WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY MUCH DOING IT THE SAME WAY, AND WE REALIZED IT, AND TODAY'S MEDIA LANDSCAPE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IT'S ALL MOBILE AND SOCIAL, IT'S A DIFFERENT BALL GAME.
Stephen: WHAT DOES IT ACTUALLY DO? HOW WILL THIS NEW APP BE USED TO TRY TO GET ME FIRED? (LAUGHTER)
WE DESIGNED A BETTER WAY TO ASK A QUESTION.
Stephen: SHOUT IT? NO, NO. IN FACT, THERE'S MORE CHARACTERS, FIRST OF ALL, AND YOU CAN USE PICTURES, YOU CAN USE MAPS, AND THE QUESTIONS GO OUT TO REAL PEOPLE IN ALL OF YOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS. FIRST AND SECOND REVIEW QUESTIONS. HAVE YOU HEARD THE STRENGTH OF WEAK TIES?
Stephen: NO. YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ALL KIND OF KNOW THE SAME STUFF.
Stephen: RIGHT. BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS HAS A LAWYER, AND HE'S AN ACQUAINTANCE, AND HIS CIRCLE OF FRIENDS KNOWS A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF.
Stephen: AND IS HE GOING TO CHARGE ME BY THE HOUR?
NO, THE APP IS FREE AND AVAILABLE NOW FOR BOTH IOS AND ANDROID. SO THAT ACQUAINTANCE JUMPS YOUR QUESTION INTO A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE. SO FOR ANY QUESTION, THERE'S A PERSON OUT THERE WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE ANSWER FOR YOU. SO YOU SHOULD REALLY DOWNLOAD IT IF I DIDN'T WANT TO READ YOUR BOOK, COULD I FIND SOMEONE ON JELLY TO TELL ME WHAT IT'S ABOUT?
YES.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. OR USE IT TO FIND OUT WHERE TO BUY IT. BIZ STONE, THINGS A LITTLE BIRD TOLD ME. THANK YOU, BIZ.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
