(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BOOM, RIGHT THERE!  COME ON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WHOOO! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. I THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ALL. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. OH MY GOSH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, WITH THAT KIND OF RECEPTION, WITH THAT KIND OF ENERGY WITH THAT KIND OF LOVE I CAN DO THIS TWICE A NIGHT! NATION, AS YOU KNOW I'M A POLITICAL JUNKIE AND TONIGHT I'M RIDING HIGH BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SNORTING PURE, UNCUT BUNTING. YOU SEE IT IS PRIMARY SEASON WHICH THANKS TO GLOBAL WARMING WILL SOON BE OUR LAST REMAINING SEASON. AND YESTERDAY REPUBLICAN VOTERS WENT TO THE POLLS IN SIX STATES TO CHOOSE WHICH CANDIDATES USED OUTSIDE MONEY TO AIR THE MOST COMMERCIALS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDIA IS A BUNCH OF TEA PARTY POOPERS.
BREAKING NEWS OVERNIGHT. A BIG VICTORY FOR THE GOP TAKING DOWN TEA PARTY CHALLENGERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
THE TEA PARTY IS BEATEN BACK.
TEA PARTY SHUTOUT LAST NIGHT.
VOTERS HAVE SAID NO TO TEA PARTY CHALLENGERS ALMOST ACROSS THE BOARD.
YES.
CHOOSING INSTEAD TO GO WITH THE TRIED, THE TESTED, THE ESTABLISHMENT. TAKING INCUMBENTS OVER UPSTARTS. SO IS THE TEA PARTY OVER?
NO, THE TEA PARTY IS NOT OVER! ANY MORE THAN THE DONNER PARTY IS OVER. (LAUGHTER) -- HOW ARE THEY DOING, BY THE WAY. THEY DIDN'T BRING A LOT OF FOOD UP THERE. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THOSE GUYS. AND IF YOU NEED MORE PROOF THAT THE TEA PARTY SPIRIT OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT LIBERTY FREEDOM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN MITCH McCONNELL'S VICTORY PARTY LAST NIGHT. NO, JIMMY, LATER ON, DURING HIS SPEECH.
FOR FIVE AND A HALF YEARS THE POWERS THAT BE IN WASHINGTON HAVE TREATED THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE WITH CONTEMPT. AND TONIGHT I HAVE A SIMPLE MESSAGE FOR ALL OF THEM. THOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED.
Stephen: YEAH, OH YOU'RE GOING GET IT, WASHINGTON POWERS THAT BE. I FEEL SORRY FOR WHATEVER JERK HAS REPRESENTED KENTUCKY FOR THESE PAST 30 YEARS. IF MITCH McCONNELL CATCHES SIGHT OF THAT GUY IN SAY A MIRROR IT'S ON. BUT OF COURSE THE BIGGEST PRIMARY WAS IN THE GREAT STATE OF IDAHO. ALSO KNOWN AS THE PILLOW MONTANA USES TO PRACTICE KISSING. (LAUGHTER) SEE THAT UP THERE. (APPLAUSE) THE GUBERNATORIAL REPUBLICAN NOMINATION WAS SEEN AS A CONTEST BETWEEN INCUMBENT GOVERNOR AND WIND IN THE WILLOWS CHARACTER BUTCH OTTER AND HIS CONSERVATIVE OPPONENT RUSS FULCHER WHO IS RUNNING TO THE RIGHT SO MAYBE BADGER. SO LAST THURSDAY'S PRIMARY DEBATE WAS DOMINATED BY TWO OTHER CANDIDATES, HARLEY BROWN, FORMER COMMANDING OFFICER OF NAVAL CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND MR. WALT BAYES, A GREAT GRANDFATHER AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. NOW THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL A BIG TENT. BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE WALT BAYES LIVES IN A TENT MADE FROM THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE FOUGHT FOR A GOLD NUGGET. AND FOLKS, EVEN AN OTTER HEAD LIKE ME WAS CHARMED WHEN I HEARD HARLEY BROWN'S OPENING REMARKS EXPLAINING WHY HE IS RUNNING.
I WAS AT THE LOW POINT OF MY LIFE. I MEAN THINGS WERE BAD. AND I CRIED OUT TO GOD. I SAID, GOD HOW ABOUT PUTTING ME BACK ON ACTIVE DUTY AND MAKING ME A BATTALION COMMANDER. LONG STORY SHORT,  HE SAYS NO, SON, I GOT A HIGHER RANK FOR YOU, I WILL MAKE YOU THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF. AND I STAGGERED NOT ON HIS PROMISE. I'LL GET INTO THAT MORE WITH YOU. DON'T THINK I'M CRAZY 'CAUSE I'M NOT. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO REASSURING OPENING STATEMENTS, THAT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH I KNOW WE JUST MET BUT I DON'T HAVE A HUMAN HEAD IN MY FREEZER. ALL RIGHT. RIGHT OFF THE BAT I WAS SOLD. HARLEY BROWN WAS MY GUY  BUT THEN WE HEARD FROM WALT BAYES COMING AT YOU HOT AND HARD LIKE A VENGEFUL BACKWOODS SANTA.
JIM.
GOVERNOR OTTER, ABOUT THE EMISSIONS HE TRIED TO MAKE ME TAKE AN EMISSIONS TEST AND I TOLD HIM WHAT TO DO WITH IT. I DROVE THREE YEARS AND MY WIFE DROVE THREE YEARS WITHOUT ANY LICENSE OVER IT. NOBODY DONE ANYTHING. I STAND ON PRINCIPLES. I WENT TO JAIL FOR HOME SCHOOLING. I DID KILL A WOLF WHILE IT WAS STILL AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.
Stephen: SMART MOVE, SMART MOVE, WALT, OPEN WITH YOUR CRIMINAL HISTORY. GET IT OUT THERE BEFORE THE LANE STREAM MEDIA HITS YOU WITH ALL THOSE GOTCHA QUESTIONS ABOUT SHOOTING WOLVES. OKAY THIS ROUND POINT BAYES, ESPECIALLY AFTER BROWN ALMOST LOST ME WHEN HE CAME OUT AS SOFT ON GAY MARRIAGE.
I USED TO DRIVE TAXIS IN BOISE FOR 20 YEARS AT NIGHT. AND I PICKED UP MY FAIR SHARE OF THE GAY COMMUNITY. AND THEY HAVE TRUE LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER. I'M TELLING YOU, THEY LOVE EACH OTHER MORE THAN I LOVE MY MOTORCYCLE. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY. ADMITTEDLY THAT PULLS AT THE HEART STRINGS. BUT AS A CONSERVATIVE I DID NOT EXPECT TO HEAR PRO GAY SENTIMENTS FROM A BURLY MAN IN A TINY LEATHER HAT AND VEST. (LAUGHTER) BUT THEN HARLEY WON ME BACK.
THE KEY IS GETTING OUR LAND BACK FROM THE FEDS. AND HERE'S MY PLAN OF ATTACK. YOU BIND THOSE EVIL SPIRITS THAT ARE BEHIND THE FEDS WITH THE BLOOD OF JESUS, THE NAME OF JESUS, THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE POWER OF AGREEMENT, THE WORD OF GOD. TAKE AIR SUPERIORITY AND THEN ROLL IN WITH YOUR TANKS.
MR. BROWN.
BLITZKRIEG.
MR. BROWN, THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT TAXES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: MAYBE, MAYBE SO. AND HE WAS GETTING THERE BEFORE YOU SO RUDELY INTERRUPTED HIM. CLEARLY HIS POINT WAS THAT IF YOU USE IT TO BIND THE EVIL SPIRITS BEHIND THE FEDS THE BLOOD OF CHRIST SHOULD BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE. WELL, FOLKS, BEFORE LONG AND THEN AFTER LONG, IT WAS TIME FOR CLOSING STATEMENTS. WALT, STICK THE LANDING.
DO YOU REMEMBER CHERNOBYL? WHERE THE RUSSIANS HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THEIR ATOMIC ENERGY? CHERNOBYL, WHEN YOU TRANSLATE THAT INTO ENGLISH IT COMES OUT WORMWOOD, WORMWOOD IS MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE A WHOLE LOT WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING THE LAST DAYS AND IT IS RADIATION. THEY GAVE THOSE PEOPLE THAT WORK THERE   SOMETHING CALLED POTASSIUM IODIDE AND IT PLUGS   UP YOUR THYROID GLAND SO IT WON'T TAKE THIS RADIATION IN. AND ANOTHER THING YOU WANT TO KNOW IS OUR ENERGY PLANTS THAT IS RUN BY ATOMIC, THEY CAN STAND 1/15 OF AN EARTHQUAKE LIKE THAT ONE IN JAPAN AND MY BIBLE SAYS IT WILL  GET WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. WE BETTER GET US SOME, FOLKS.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: NOW THAT IS A CAMPAIGN SLOGAN THAT AMERICANS CAN RALLY BEHIND. WALT BAYES, YOU REMEMBER CHERNOBYL WHEN YOU TRANSLATE THAT IT COMES OUT WORMWOOD WHICH IS MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE A WHOLE LOT, POTASSIUM IODIDE WE GETTER GET US SOME 2014. NOW FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE) BUT FOLKS EVEN WALT'S MESSAGE OF HOPE PALED IN COMPARISON TO THE POWER OF HARLEY BROWN'S CLOSER.
AFTER GOD TOLD ME WAS GOING MAKE ME PRESIDENT I WENT OUT AND GOT THE PRESIDENTIAL SEAL TATTOOED RIGHT HERE ON MY SHOULDER. I WAS LIVING IN FAT JACK'S CELLAR BECAUSE MY EX-WIFE HAD GIVEN ME TRUMPED UP RESTRAINING ORDERS. I COULDN'T SEE MY KIDS. IT WAS A MESS. FAT JACK'S OLD LADY,  FAT JACK'S WIFE SAID GET THIS LUNATIC OUT OF MY CELLAR. YOU HAVE A CHOICE, FOLKS. A COWBOY, A CURMUDGEON, A BIKER  OR A NORMAL GUY. TAKE YOUR PICK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE'RE LEAVING IT UP TO YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YEAH! WHO INVITED THE NORMAL GUY. YOU GOT A COWBOY, A CURMUDGEON AND AN OLD COOT. THEY WERE ONE CONSTRUCTION WORKER AWAY FROM BREAKING INTO YMCA. WELL, FOLKS, SHOCKINGLY NEITHER OF THESE TWO WON THE PRIMARY LAST NIGHT. AND NEITHER DID TEA PARTY CANDIDATE RUSS FULLCHER. THE NOMINATION WENT TO GOVERNOR OTTER. BUT TEA PARTY FOLKS, THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER. WE STILL HAVE THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND AFTER WATCHING THAT DEBATE IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE CANDIDATE IDAHO NEEDS IS FAT JACK'S OLD LADY. (LAUGHTER) SHE-- FAT JACK'S OLD LADY--  (APPLAUSE) HAS A MESSAGE THAT RESONATES WITH AMERICA. GET THIS LUNATIC OUT OF MY CELLAR. -- CELLAR, THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT CAN DEFEAT NOT JUST GOVERNOR OTTER BUT ALSO IDAHO'S DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE POTATO WITH A MUSTACHE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
