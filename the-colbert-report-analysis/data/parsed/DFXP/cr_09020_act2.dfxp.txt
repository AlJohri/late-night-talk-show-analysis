EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A BEARDED  CONSERVATIVE WHO FAMOUSLY  SUPPORTS BARACK OBAMA. AFTER THIS, HE WILL BE GOING TO  THE SMITHSONIAN. PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW SULLIVAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  HI ANDREW.
HI, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. COME ON. I'LL PUT A PANCHO ON.
I JUST WANT TO TASTE THE  TEARS OF UNFATHOMABLE SADNESS. [CROWD CHEERING] > Stephen:  CAN I GET A RAIN>  CHECK ON THAT ONE ANDREW.
RIGHT NOW. IT'S CHALLENGING HIS OWN POLLING  UNIT AND TELLING HIM THEY'RE  WRONG.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU THINK  HAPPENS TO CARL NOW, HE PROMISED  MY BILLIONAIRE FRIEND THAT IF THEY GIVE HIM $300 MILLION HE  WOULD DELIVER OBAMA ON A  PLATTER.
SO WE HAVE TO GO INTO A  WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM NOW. I MEAN SHELDON ADLESON POURED  MILLION IN SIX RACES AND LOST  ALL SIX OF THEM. MONEY IS NOT -- [CROWD CHEERING]
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S NEXT? HOW DO I STOP OBAMA IN 2016?
YOU CAN'T. AS A BLACK MAN IN POWER, YOU  HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. [CROWD CHEERING]
I'VE GOT TO SAY THAT THAT'S  REALLY SCARY. THAT'S LIKE WHITE COLLAR  LITERATURE YOU JUST PASSED DOWN.
POWER WITH NOTHING TO LOSE.
THAT'S THE PARANOIA GOING ON.
SO AMERICA, YOU'RE FROM  EUROPE. OKAY THAT'S LIKE AMERICA, WE ALL  BECOME EUROPE OVER HERE. DO I HAVE TO DRIVE ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE ROAD NOW. SAY TOP OF THE MORNING.
THE GREAT THING IS IN EUROPE  FOUR YEARS AGO UNEMPLOYMENT IS  8% NOW IT'S ALMOST 12%. UNDER OBAMA IN AMERICA WITHOUT  AUSTERITY WHICH ROMNEY WAS  PROMISING UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW BACK TO WHERE IT WAS WHEN IT  STARTED. SO AMERICA'S GOING IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION. EUROPE'S GOING TO FOLLOW OBAMA,  I THINK. [CROWD CHEERING]
LET'S TALK TURKEY. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A PREVIEW OF  MY PLAY BOOK. YOU KNOW WHAT THE SECOND TERM'S  ALL ABOUT, RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. GET READY AUTHORITY THESE WORDS,  OKAY. I GOT TWO WORDS FOR YOU BEN GOT  -- BENGHAZI -- I DON'T KNOWGOT   WHAT THEY MEAN.
YOU'RE SPEAKING EUROPEAN TO  ME. WHAT THE [BLEEP] DOES THAT MEAN.
BENGHAZI WASN'T DECIDING THE  ISSUE OF THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE  IT'S AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE CLOSURE OF THE REPUBLICAN  RIGHTS, THE FIELD BUBBLE HAS  BEEN BURST AND IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN THEY MEET ACTUAL REALITY. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  YOU UNDER  ESTIMATE OUR ARMOR MY FRIEND. YOU USED TO BE A CONSERVATIVE.
I AM A CONSERVATIVE.
BULL DOOKIE. IF WE WEREN'T LIVE --
THOSE MODERATE REPUBLICANS,  NOW CALLED MODERATE IN THOSE  POLLS VOTED FOR MODERATE REPUBLICANS CALLED BARACK OBAMA  WHO IS A VERY MODERATE  PRESIDENT. HAS BEEN AND MOST PEOPLE  UNDERSTAND THAT. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  SO WHAT HAPPENS. IS THERE NOW A CIVIL WAR WITHIN  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
HOPE SO. BECAUSE I WANT CONSERVATISM TO  REVIVE. I WANT IT TO BE CONNECTED TO  REALITY. TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD. TO THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF  THE SOCIETY, THE CHANGING NATURE  OF THE SOCIETY AND COME UP WITH CONSTRUCTIVE PROPOSALS TO HELP  SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. I WANT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO  MAKE OBAMACARE BETTER RATHER  THAN ACTUALLY JUST ABOLISHING  IT. I WANT -- [CROWD CHEERING] I WANT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO  ACCEPT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS  HAPPENING FOR GOODNESS SAKE. [CROWD CHEERING] AND I DON'T THINK THEY'VE BEEN  OPEN TO PERSUASION SO FAR, BUT I  THINK THE ONE THING THEY UNDERSTAND IS LOSING. AND THEY BELIEVE THEY WON BY A  LANDSLIDE. THEY'RE TELLING US, GEORGE WILL  AND MICHAEL BARON WERE  PREDICTING, THEY'RE NOT CRAZY, MAYBE STREAM REPUBLICANS VERY  SERIOUS PEOPLE TELLING US IT  WOULD BE A LANDSLIDE FOR ROMNEY. WHERE DO THEY GO NOW.
Stephen:  I KNOW THE  PROBLEM. THEY WEREN'T CONSENSUALIVE  ENOUGH MUCH YOU KNOW  CONSERVATIVISM CANNOT FAIL, YOU CAN ONLY FAIL CONSERVATIVISM. THEY DID NOT FIELD A TRUE  CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE.
HAD HE HAD A SEVERE  CONSERVATIVE -- >>CONSERVATIVE --
Stephen:  THAT GUY WAS FLIP  FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE. I NEVER BELIEVED HIM. I NEVER BELIEVED THAT GUY. HE'S A MASSACHUSETTS MODERATE. I SAID THAT FROM THE BEGINNING  ANDREW. CHECK THE TAPE.
WE WILL HAVE TO CHECK THE  TAPE. BUT NO, PAUL RYAN WAS THE WAY IN  WHICH HE PERSUADED THE  REPUBLICAN BASE THAT HE'S WON IT  IN. I MEAN HE HAD THE REPUBLICAN  BASE. HE DID NOT LOSE THIS ELECTION  BECAUSE HE WASN'T CONSERVATIVE  ENOUGH. HE LOST THE MODERATES IN THE  MIDDLE IN PLACES LIKE OHIO, IN  PLACES LIKE FLORIDA WHERE HE JUST COULDN'T AFFORD TO. AND I THINK IT'S A TRIUMPH OF AN  ACTUAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST PURE  CYNICISM AND LIES. AND I THINK THAT IS A HUGE  VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,  I REALLY DO. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  PLEASE COME  AGAIN.
WILL DO.
Stephen:  AND PLEASE TELL  YOUR LIBERAL FRIENDS I WILL SEE  THEM IN [BLEEP] ANDREW SUL
