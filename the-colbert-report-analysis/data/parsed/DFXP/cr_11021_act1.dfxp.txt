Stephen: TONIGHT, REPUBLICANS RETAKE CONGRESS. COULD THEY DRIVE ITS APPROVAL RATING ALL THE WAY UP TO ZERO? (LAUGHTER) THEN, AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN SNACK FOODS. CHEESE NIPS THAT CONTAIN REAL CHEESE -- AND REAL NIPPLE! (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST IS ANDY COHEN, HOST OF BRAVO'S "WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE." TONIGHT, YOU CAN WATCH WHAT HAPPENS PRETAPED. (LAUGHTER) A SCIENTIST IN GERMANY HAS DISCOVERED A WAY TO MAKE  DIAMONDS FROM PEANUT BUTTER. SO FELLAS, YOU CAN NOW PROPOSE WITH A JAR OF JIF. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THAT'S THE SOUND OF FREEDOM, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH! PLEASE, SIT DOWN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT DID AN AMAZING NIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THESE ONES (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. LET'S DO THE SHOW, WE'VE GOT LOT TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT. OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GOING TO BE ANALYZING THE ONGOING GEOPOLITICAL REALIGNMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH ANDY COHEN MAYBE OVER SOME COCKTAILS. (LAUGHTER) BUT FIRST, NATION, HUGE NEWS OUT OF NORTH KOREA WHERE DEAR LEADER KIM JONG-UN HAS FINALLY RE-EMERGED IN PUBLIC AFTER A COURAGEOUS BATTLE WITH STAGE 5  CHEESE ANKLE. SO GOOD TO SEE HIM BACK. UNFORTUNATELY, HIS BEST FRIEND LUBEY WASN'T AVAILABLE TO CELEBRATE WITH HIM, SO INSTEAD KIM PAID A VISIT TO THE SECOND HAPPIEST PLACE IN NORTH KOREA. AN ORPHANAGE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE BEDS ARE ALL EMPTY BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE AT WORK. WHICH IS TOO BAD. KIM WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO TEACHING THEM HOW TO SMOKE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, HE'LL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO PASS THE CIGARETTE OFF TO THE STUFFED ANIMALS BONING ON THE DRESSER IN THE BACKGROUND (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING) BUT FOLKS, AS MUCH AS THIS PHOTO DELIGHTS, THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER STORY COMING OUT OF THE HERMIT KINGDOM.
TWO AMERICAN PRISONERS, KENNETH BAE AND MATTHEW TODD MILLER, RETURNED TO U.S. SOIL FROM NORTH KOREA.
WE HAD AN INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF RELEASE, AND WE PURSUED IT. IT'S A GOOD-NEWS STORY.
Stephen: IS IT A GOOD NEWS STORY, SIR? 'CUZ FOX NEWS IS REPORTING, "OBAMA CANCELS TWO AMERICANS' VACATIONS." YEAH, SHOCKING. OF COURSE, THE MOST MIRACULOUS PART OF THEIR RELEASE IS THAT IT WAS NOT NEGOTIATED BY DENNIS RODMAN. (LAUGHTER)
THIS RELEASE WAS SECURED BY AMERICA'S TOP SPY, JAMES CLAPPER, THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE WHO CARRIED A PERSONAL LETTER FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA TO NORTH KOREAN LEADERS.
Stephen: YEP, WE GAVE THEM A DOSE OF THE CLAPPER! (LAUGHTER) AND ALL IT TOOK WAS A PERSONAL LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT. THAT WAS A NICE PERSONAL TOUCH. THESE DAYS, TOO MANY KIDS JUST TEXT THEIR PARDON REQUESTS. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO SAY, I DON'T ENVY THESE MEN. TWO YEARS OF FORCED LABOR. THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD.
I LEARNED A LOT. I GREW A LOT. LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT IN A GOOD WAY.
OR MAYBE IT WAS GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO RICH OR TOO IMPRISONED IN NORTH KOREA. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WE'VE ALL TRIED THE ZONE DIET. MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE DIET. PLUS, THERE'S NO CHANCE YOU WILL GIVE UP EARLY, BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST AS HARD TO GET OUT OF NORTH KOREA AS IT IS A GYM MEMBERSHIP. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, WELCOME HOME, GENTLEMEN. I FOR ONE AM STILL RIDING HIGH FROM THE G.O.P.'S TRIUMPH IN LAST WEEK'S MIDTERM ELECTION. THIS MEANS THERE WILL BE MORE REPUBLICANS THAN EVER MAKING GOVERNMENT SMALLER BY WORKING FULL-TIME IN WASHINGTON. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS VICTORY.
WE'VE GOT A NEW CONGRESS, WE'VE GOT A NEW MANDATE.
THE MANDATE WAS SKEPTICISM BY AMERICAN PEOPLE THE COUNTRY IS NOT HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY A MANDATE.
Stephen: YES, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY A MANDATE, THANKS TO AN HISTORIC TURNOUT OF JUST 37% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS, THE LOWEST SINCE 1942. AND REMEMBER, THAT WAS THE GREATEST GENERATION! BACK THEN, ON ELECTION DAY, THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TOO BUSY ANSWERING THE CALL OF DUTY TO VOTE. JUST LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW THAT THE G.O.P. HAS THEIR LARGEST MAJORITY IN 85 YEARS, THANKS TO THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT IN 72 YEARS, THEY HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ENACT THE AGENDA OF THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE SMALLEST COUNTY IN IOWA. THEY JUST NEED TO DO ONE THING --
NOW THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO GOVERN.
PUT FORWARD THEIR PLANS, THEIR IDEAS, THEIR SOLUTIONS FOR THE COUNTRY.
THEY NEED TO STEP FORWARD WITH A PLAN.
SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN GOVERN.
REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO TAKE THIS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND ACTUALLY GOVERN SOMETHING.
Stephen: YES, IT IS TIME FOR REPUBLICANS TO GOVERN. BEFORE THIS, THEY WERE JUST PAID EXTRAS ON C-SPAN. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT CALL FOR G.O.P. LEADERSHIP BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, SENATOR AKBAR. IT IS A TRAP. IT MAY SEEM LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT REPUBLICANS TO GET SOMETHING DONE, BUT DON'T YOU FALL FOR IT! THAT'S NOT JUST AKBAR TALKING. THAT'S ALSO ADVICE FROM JABBA THE RUSH.
IT IS THE BIGGEST AND PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT MANDATE A POLITICAL PARTY HAS HAD IN THE RECENT ERA, IT IS VERY SIMPLE WHAT THE MANDATE IS. IT IS TO STOP BARACK OBAMA. REPUBLICANS WERE NOT ELECTED TO GOVERN.
Stephen: THANK YOU. REPUBLICANS WERE NOT ELECTED TO GOVERN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HUGE, HUGE RUSH LIMBAUGH FANS HERE TONIGHT! (CHEERING) REPUBLICANS WEREN'T ELECTED TO GOVERN. THEIR ONE JOB IS TO STOP OBAMA! BUT THERE'S AN EVEN MORE URGENT REASON TO DO NOTHING. (LAUGHTER) ACCORDING TO A NEW EDITORIAL BY THE NATIONAL REVIEW CALLED "THE GOVERNING TRAP," IF VOTERS CAME TO BELIEVE THAT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS AND A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT ARE DOING A FINE JOB OF GOVERNING TOGETHER, WHY WOULDN'T THEY VOTE TO CONTINUE THE ARRANGEMENT IN 2016? YES, THEN YOU WILL BE TRAPPED TOGETHER FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS DOING A COMPETENT JOB OF GOVERNING! WHO WANTS THAT? POINT IS, ANYTHING REPUBLICANS ACCOMPLISH, NO MATTER HOW INSIGNIFICANT, COULD LEAD TO PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. (CHEERING) BESIDES, NOBODY LIKES PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GOVERN. LOOK AT OBAMA. HE TURNED THE ECONOMY AROUND AND GAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HEALTHCARE -- WHAT AN ASSHOLE. AND AS THE NATIONAL REVIEW POINTS OUT, NOT ONLY WOULD GOVERNING BE TOO EFFECTIVE, IT WOULD ALSO BE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE. BECAUSE "IF REPUBLICANS PROCLAIM THAT THEY HAVE TO GOVERN NOW THAT THEY RUN CONGRESS, THEY MAXIMIZE THE INCENTIVE FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO FILIBUSTER EVERYTHING THEY CAN." YES, AND FILIBUSTERING EVERYTHING YOU CAN IS COWARDLY. WHAT IS WORSE: "A PROVE-YOU-CAN-GOVERN STRATEGY WILL INEVITABLY DIVIDE THE PARTY ON THE SAME TEA PARTY VS. ESTABLISHMENT LINES THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE JUST SUCCEEDED IN OVERCOMING." THAT'S RIGHT. IF REPUBLICANS DO ANYTHING, IT WILL START THE INFIGHTING. THINK ABOUT IT -- THE BEATLES NEVER WOULD HAVE BROKEN UP IF THEY NEVER RELEASED ANY RECORDS. INSTEAD OF MAKING THE MISTAKE OF DOING THINGS NOW, THE NATIONAL REVIEW SAYS THE G.O.P. SHOULD FOCUS ON THE FUTURE BY"BUILDING THE CASE FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNANCE AFTER 2016" AND "EXPLAINING WHAT REPUBLICANS... WOULD DO IF THEY HAD THE WHITE HOUSE ." YES, IT'S TIME TO SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT  REPUBLICANS ARE CAPABLE OF BOLD, DECISIVE ACTION... SOMETIME LATER. (LAUGHTER) THEN REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE BACK THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY CONTROL THE PRESIDENCY AND BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS, AT LAST IT WILL BE TIME TO GOVERN... IS JUST WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK. BECAUSE THAT'S JUST ANOTHER TRAP! BECAUSE THE G.O.P. CAN'T ACT UNTIL THEY'VE SECURED AN ALL-REPUBLICAN SUPREME COURT, 50 REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, 50 REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATORS, AND AN ALL-REPUBLICAN PROM COMMITTEE. (LAUGHTER) AND EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO DEMOCRATS LEFT ANYWHERE, THEY STILL SHOULD NOT GOVERN. BECAUSE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN COULD RUN AGAINST THEM IN THE PRIMARY. AND THEY'D BE WIDE OPEN TO ATTACKS ON THEIR VOTING RECORD IF THEY HAVE ONE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, REFUSING TO GOVERN AT ALL MIGHT EVENTUALLY BECOME HARD TO SELL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, SO THEY MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THERE ISN'T AN AMERICA ANYMORE. AND IF THEY REFUSE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GOVERN, WELL, THAT WILL BE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
