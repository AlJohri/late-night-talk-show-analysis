( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO  BELIEVE BUT IT'S BEEN FIVE WHOLE  YEARS SINCE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS COST THE U.S. ECONOMY  MORE THAN $22 TRILLION. AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT WHO TO BLAME. WAS IT THE PATRIOTIC BANKERS  WILLING TO FUT ALL ON THE LINE  TO MAKE AMERICA THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD OR THE  GREEDY RECKLESS HOME GRUBBERS  LOOKING FOR THE CHEAP THRILL OF HEAT AND SHELTER? WE CAN ARGUE ALL DAY. AT THIS POINT, WHO KNOWS WHICH  SIDE HAS BETTER LAWYERS. AND YET, SOME PEOPLE JUST WON'T  LET IT GO.
WE'RE THIS FAR AFTER THE  FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND NO ONE'S  IN JAIL.
THERE'S BEEN NOBODY PUT IN  JAIL BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL  COLLAPSE.
IT DOES SEEM EXTRAORDINARY  NOT ONE OF THEM HAS EVER BEEN  PUT IN JAIL.
NO.
NOT ONE.
Stephen:  OH, THE ANGRY MOB  WANTS A SCALP, AND GOLDMAN SACHS  C.E.O. LLOYD BLANKFEIN IS PRACTICALLY DARING THEM WITH  THAT THING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELL, EVERYONE CAN FINALLY CALM  DOWN. BECAUSE WE GOT HIM.
IT TOOK FIVE YEARS BUT THIS  MORNING THE GOVERNMENT IS  CELEBRATINGS ITS FIRST BIG VICTORY IN COURT, IN ITS ATTEMPT  TO HOLD WALL STREET ACCOUNTABLE  FOR THE FNLD CRISE. FORMER GOLDMAN SACHS TRADER  FABRICE TOURRE, KNOWN BY HIS  NICKNAME-- "FABULOUS FAB--" HAS BEEN FOUND LIABLE FOR FRAUD FOR  HIS ROLE IN A FAILED MORTGAGE  DEAL THAT COST INVESTORS $1  MILLION.
FABRICE TOURRE IS FOUND  LIABLE FOR DEFRAUDING INVESTORS. IT IS A HUGE VICTORY FOR THE  S.E.C.
Stephen:  A $1 BILLION  FRAUD OUT OF A $22 TRILLION  MELTDOWN. LET ME DO THE MATH HERE AND SEE  WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AND THAT IS... MY CALCULATOR WON'T TAKE NUMBERS  THAT LARGE. SO HOW DID-- HOW DID THE SLEUTHS  AT THE S.E.C. PROVE THIS  MASTERMIND KNOWINGLY MISLED HIS  INVESTORS? HE SENT E-MAILS SAYING HE  KNOWINGLY MISLED HIS INVESTORS. SAYING, "THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS  AT THE RISK OF COLLAPSE AT ANY  MOMENT. ONLY POTENTIAL SURVIVOR? THE FABULOUS FAB."  STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL  THESE COMPLEX, HIGHLY LEVERAGED EXOTIC TRADES HE CREATED WITHOUT  NECESSARILY UNDERSTANDING ALL  THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE  MONFROSTS. WHEN THAT E-MAIL CAME OUT,  FOLKS, EVERYBODY ON WALL STREET  HAD THE SAME REACTION-- "WE SHOULD HIRE THAT GUY."  DURING HIS TRIAL FEBREEZE HAD AN  EXPLANATION CALLING THE E-MAIL A SILLY ROMANTIC E-MAIL TO MY  GIRLFRIEND. I MEAN, THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR INSTANCE, THIS IS THE  VALENTINE'S CARD I GAVE MY WIFE  THIS YEAR. "HOW DO I LOVE THEE? LET ME COUNT THE WAYS... USE, ARCANE ACCOUNT METHODS THAT  HIDE OF MAJORITY OF MY LOVE IN A  SHELL CORPORATION IN THEICA MEN -- CAYMEN ISLANDS."  ( APPLAUSE )  ANYWAY, THEY THREW THE BOOK AT  HIM. AFTER ALL, THIS MAN OH, STRAIGHT  THE GLOBAL SUBPRIME CRISIS FROM  HIS LOFTY PERCH AS A 28-YEAR-OLD MIDLEVEL TRADER. SORRY, GORDON GECKO. YOUR DAYS OF FLAUNTING YOUR SIX  FLAGS FLASH PASS ARE OVER. NO MORE THREE-MARTINI LUNCHES AT  QUIZNOS, AND DON'T EVEN CALL. THEY WILL NOT BE HOLDING YOUR  TABLE ANYMORE AT JARDIN D'OLIVE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
