(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL TOMORROW TO THE SHOW. WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
STEVE EBB, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: OH MY GOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS AS CLOSELY AS I HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IS THIS A SOMBER YET JOYOUS TIME AS WE REMEMBER AND CELEBRATE THE LIFE OF THE GREAT NELSON MANDELA. HE TAUGHT THE WORLD ABOUT JUSTICE, PERSEVERANCE AND FORGIVENESS. I REMEMBER MY OWN INDELIBLE MOMENT WITH THE MAN WHO ENDED APARTHEID CAME A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I TRAVELED TO SOUTH AFRICA. SADLY WE DID NOT MEET BECAUSE--  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: MY FULL SCHEDULE AND BECAUSE OF HIM NOT KNOWING WHO I WAS--  (LAUGHTER) WE RESPECTED EACH OTHER THAT WAY. AND LIKE SO MANY WHO WERE CLOSE TO THIS GREAT MAN, I HAD MANY SPECIAL NAMES FOR HIM.
YOU NEAR NELSON MANDELA REFERRED TO AS MADIBA.
IT A CLAN NAME, A FAMILIAR NAME, A SENSE OF BELONGING.
CALLED MADIBA.
THE MAN THAT JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY HERE CALLS TATA.
FATHER.
THE FAN ME CALLED TATA PAD INA.
THE NEW DAY IS SOUTH AFRICA, THE FIRST IN 95 YEARS WITHOUT MADIBA.
Stephen: SOME CALLED HIM MADIBA, SOME CALLED HIM MADIBA OR TATA OR TATA MADIBA. THOSE OF US IN HIS INNERCIRCLE OF COURSE CALLED HIM NUTELLA.  RICH, CREAMY CHOCOLATE HAZEL NUT JUSTICE. MANDELA RADIATED SO MUCH LOVE THAT WE IN THE MEDIA OFTEN FELT OUR CONCERNS WERE HIS CONCERNS. WHICH IS NO DOUBT WHY ESPN HONORED HIS LEGACY WITH THIS HEADLINE, MANDELA 95 DIES, BROKERED 2010 WORLD CUP. YES, DURING HIS 27 YEARS IN PRISON MADIBA TOOK STRENGTH IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE DAY HE WOULD BRING THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE SOUND OF FREEDOM. OF COURSE WHEN YOU THINK OF OPPRESSED BLACK PEOPLE YOU THINK REPUBLICAN PARTY. (LAUGHTER) AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW RICK SANTORUM SPELLED OUT EXACTLY WHY MADIBA INSPIRES HIM.
NELSON MANDELA STOOD UP AGAINST A GREAT INJUSTICE. I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE HAVE A GREAT INJUSTICE GOING ON RIGHT NOW THIS THIS COUNTRY WITH AN EVER-INCREASING SIZE OF GOVERNMENT THAT ISIC THATTING OVER AND CONTROLLING PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND OBAMACARE IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THAT.
Stephen: QUESTION, OBAMACARE IS AMERICA'S APARTHEID. LEV LAUGH.
Stephen: AND IF RICK SANTORUM IS THE ONE FIGHTING IT, THEN HE IS AMERICA'S NELSON MANDELA. OR AS HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS CALL HIM, TATA VANILLA. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS UPON US UNLESS YOU ARE JEWISH IN WHICH CASE IT IS ALREADY COME AND GONE. SO DEPRESSING TO SEE THE MENORAHS OUT ON THE CURB. BUT I'M SAENDED THAT PEOPLE ARE LOSING SIGHT OF THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS. PUNCHING A GRANDMA FOR A PS4. INSTEAD FOLKS LIKE WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE JIM McDERMOTT ALWAYS TWISTS JESUS'S TEACHINGS TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT CARING FOR YOUR FELLOW MAN.
WE'RE THE RICHEST NATION IN THE WORLD AND WHEN JESUS HAD THE FIVE LOAFS AND TWO FISHES, HE DIDN'T CHARGE FOOD STAMPS. HE DIDN'T ASK ANYBODY HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAD. HE FED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE HUNGRY.
Stephen: YEAH, MAYBE. BUT REMEMBER, REMEMBER, FOLKS, AFTER THE MULTITUDES WERE FED, THE DISCIPLES PICK APPROXIMATED UP 12 BASKET FULLS OF BROKEN PIECES THAT WERE LEFT OVER. HE MADE TOO MUCH. WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS MULTIPLIED SOME IT UPERWARE, OKAY, THAT'S HOW I WOULD HAVE DONE T I ALSO WOULD HAVE SERVED OLIVES, EVIDENTLY. NOW GUYS--  (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE LOVE OLIVES. PEOPLE LOVE OLIVES. DOCTOR SAYS I'M NOT GETTING ENOUGH PIMENTO. GUYS LIKE McDERMOTT MAKE JESUS SOUND LIKE HE WAS SOME KIND OF SOFT TOUCH. THANKFULLY PAPA BEAR BILL O REILLY KNOWS WHAT GOD REALLY WANTS.
YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN McDERMOTT CONVINCED PEOPLE BY SAYING JESS WUS FEED THE POOR, WHICH HE WOULD. WE ALL KNOW THAT. THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AS I STATED IS ARE YOU HELPING ONE GROUP BY HURTING NEVER GROUP. AN A BIGGER GROUP. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF JESS SUS GOING TO BE DOWN WITH THAT.
Stephen: EXACTLY. (LAUGHTER) JESUS WOULD NOT BE DOWN WITH TAKING MY TAXES TO PAY FOR FOOD STAMPS. JESUS DIDN'T TAKE THE LOAFS AND FISHES FROM THE RICH. HE CONJURED THEM OUT OF THIN AIR. HE WAS LIKE CHRIST ANGEL MINDFRIED. BESIDES SOME OF THE HELPLESS DESERVE EVEN LESS HELP.
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT, IT'S THEIR FAULT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT.
IF YOU ARE AN ALCOHOLIC OR A HEROIN ADDICT OR DRUG ADDICT AND YOU CAN'T HOLD A JOB, ALL RIGHT, AND YOU CAN CAN CAN'T SUPPORT YOUR CHILDREN, WHAT'S MY FINANCIAL RESPONSIBLE TO THEIR CHILDREN.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT IS IT MY FAULT THAT THESE KID'S PARENTS ARE DRUG ADDICTS? MAYBE IF THE KIDS KEPT THEIR ROOM CLEAN LIKE MOM ASKED SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO SMOKE CRACK. KIND OF YOUR FAULT, SUSIE, A LITTLE BIT, A LITTLE BIT YOUR FAULT, OKAY. SORRY. SO WHAT'S A CHRISTIAN LIKE ME SUPPOSED TO DO. FORGIVE THEM? NO. PLAY IT SMART.
I GIVE A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS, TO CHILDREN'S CHARITIES, OKAY.
Stephen: YES, BILL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US THAT. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE BILLBOARDS. BUT BILL GIVES RIGHT.
OKAY. CHILDREN WHO HAVE DER LIBLINGT PARENTS. AN I SAY IT'S NOT THE KID'S FAULT SO I WILL GIVE THE MONEY TO THE KIDS. BUT I DON'T GIVE IT TO CHARITIES UNLESS THE CHARITIES HANDS IT TO THE KIDS. GETS IT RIGHT TO THE KIDS. SO I'M CIRCUMVENTING THE DRUGS AND THE ALCOHOL AND THE OTHER CRAZINESS.
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S HOW BILL AND I DO IT, OKAYMENT YOU GOT TO DO IT LIKE THIS, OKAY. SOMETIMES I JUST TIE THE MONEY TO A SNAKE AND LET IT SLITER TO THE KIDS, OKAY. REMEMBER KIDS, YOU CAN TRUST PEOPLE WHO HAND MONEY TO YOU AND SAID DON'T TELL YOUR PARENTS. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS SOME OF THE POORS OUT THERE DO NOT DESERVE CHARITY, ESPECIALLY THE HOMELESS. I MEANS WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL. I WAS HOMELESS FOR A CHILD IN COLLEGE UNTIL MY ROOMMATE STOPPED HAVING SEX WITH HIS GIRLFRIENDMENT LUCKILY FOX BUSINESS HOST AND '70s PORN STUNT MUSTACHE JOHN STOSSEL IS COMMITTED TO EXPOSING THE FRAUD OF PAN HANDLING.
'TIS THE SEASON TO BE GIVING.
BUT AS JOHNS TO EL DEMONSTRATES IN TONIGHT'S EPISODE OFS TO EL NOT EVERYONE AND EVERY ORGANIZATION IS WORTHY OF YOUR CHARITY. SOME ARE ACTUALLY SCAMMERS.
I PUT ON A FAKE BEARD AND TRIED BEGGING IN NEW YORK CITY.
YOU READY TO FREELOAD?
Stephen: NOTHING SAYS OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM LIKE, ARE YOU READY TO FREELOAD? (LAUGHTER) AND THAT DAY, FOLK, JOHNS TO EL LEARNED WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW, WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT HIM, THEY'RE FILLED WITH PITTY. (LAUGHTER) JIM.
I HIT THE STREET AND STARTED BEGS.
YOU CAN HELP ME, MA'AM. PEOPLE GAVE ME MONEY. THEY GAVE ME MONEY WHEN MY CARDBOARD SIGN SAID HOMELESS AND COLD.
I JUST BEGGED FOR AN HOUR BUT I DID WELL. IF I DID THIS FOR AN EIGHT HOUR DAY I WOULD HAVE MADE 90 BUCKS, 23,000 FOR A YEAR. TAX-FREE.
11 BUCKS AN HOUR. I MEAN MAKE IT RAIN! WHILE, OF COURSE, PRAYING THAT IT DOESN'T RAIN. NOWS TO EL KNOWS WE MUST RESIST OUR NATURAL URGE TO HELP THESE BIG FAT FAKERS.
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGGING FOR MONEY ON THE STREETS, WE SHOULD NOT GIVE THEM MONEY?
YES. AND IT'S NOT I WHO AM SUGGESTING THAT, THE PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH THE HOMELESS SAY DON'T GIVE THEM MONEY. IT'S A BAD THING. ARE YOU AN ENABLER, ARE YOU ENABLING THEIR ALCOHOL OR THEIR DRUG HABIT. FAR BETTER, IF YOU REALLY THINK THEY ARE FOREREAL AND MOST ARE NOT TO TRY TO HELP THEM GET TO ONE OF THE SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES.
Stephen: I SAY DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO ASKS FOR CHANGES, ESPECIALLY THIS GUY. HE'S NOT HOMELESS. I SAW HIM IN LIKE THREE FANCY DEPARTMENT STORES. BUTS TO EL KNOWS THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM ISN'T THE SCAMMERS, IT'S THE BLEEDING HEARTS.
WHEN WE ASK GIVERS WHY THEY GAVE, PEOPLE SAID THINGS LIKE THIS.
THAT GUY LOOKED PRETTY NEEDY, I SUPPOSE.
IT IS COLD OUT, I'M PRETTY COLD MYSELF SO I'M THINKING OF HIS SITUATION.
Stephen: DON'T BE A SUCKER. REMEMBER, EMPATHETIC IS JUST TWO LETTERS AWAY FROM PATHETIC. AND JUST A FEW MORE LETTERS AWAY FROM EMPANADA OKAY. WHY CAN'T THE HOMELESS EAT THOSE. AND JOHNS TO HE'LL ADVICE IS IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS. REMEMBER WHAT JESUS SAID ABOUT GIVING THINGS TO PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW. BEFORE I WAS HUNGARY YOU GAVE ME FOOD. I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME DRUCHBLINGT I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME IN, SUCKERS, THIS IS A FAKE BEARD. BURN! WELL, FOLKS (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: CLASSIC, CLASSIC. WELL, FOLKS, I WAS SO INSPIRED BYS TO HE'LL ONE HOUR INVESTED DRESSUP THAT I TOO WENT UNDERCOVER TO EXPOSE THE SCOURGE OF SELF-LESSNESS IN TONIGHT'S FAMILY HOLIDAY SPECIAL, JIM.
STEPHEN COLBERT'S HOMELESS FOR THE HOLIDAYS. A MAN WHO IS CONVINCINGLY POOR? OH, THANK YOU KIND SIR, I LOST MY JOB AT THE PUDDING FACTORY. A WEE PROBLEM FOR A SPOT OF JAM.
