Stephen: JON, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE UPSET, OKAY?  I MEAN, REALLY?  IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I HAVE CRUSHED YOU.
WELL, I MEAN, IF MY BEING UPSET ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BREAKING THE TEN YEAR WINNING STREAK WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY, I -- I -- I WOULD DO IT.

Stephen: DAMN YOU, JON STEWART!  DAMN YOU!  DAMN YOU!  DAMN YOU!  DAMN YOU! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SERIOUSLY, IF I DO GET HURT AT THE GYM I AM CALLING YOU.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY, PLEASE DO. WHOO!  JON STEWART, EVERYBODY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: FOLKS, SPEAKING OF GOLDEN IDOLS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, MASON, AS YOU KNOW I AM TV'S FOREMOST CATHOLIC AND I TAKE MY FAITH VERY SERIOUSLY, JESUS IS NOT ONLY MY COPILOT, SOMETIMES I LET HIM DRIVE, UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE, HERE WITH OUR NEW POPE. HE IS WASHING THE FEET OF CRIMINALS, SAYING ATHEISTS CAN BE REDEEMED, NOT JUDGING THE GAYS, AND SAYING WE CAN'T SERVE GOD AND MONEY AT THE SAME TIME. OH, YES, WE CAN. AND AT THIS POINT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?  OUR MONEY HAS IN GOD WE TRUST ON IT AND I AM ASSUMING GOD HAS A TRAMP STAMP THAT SAYS A DOLLA MAKES ME HOLLA!  BUT NOW THE POPE HAS GIVEN AN EXHAUSTIVE INTERVIEW INITIATED BY THE JESUIT MAGAZINE AMERICA WHICH WAS FILLED WITH PAPAL BOMBSHELLS.
THE POPE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT SOME OF THE OLDEST STAUNCHEST TRADITIONS IN THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF GAYS AND LESBIANS, EMBRACING PROMINENT ROLES FOR WOMEN IN THE CHURCH AND HOW ABOUT CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION?
POPE FRANCIS SPOKE WITH THE JESUIT MAGAZINE CALLED AMERICA.
HE SAID IN HIS FIRST EXTENDED PUBLISHED INTERVIEW THAT THE CHURCH HAS BECOME, QUOTE, OBSESSED WITH PREACHING ABOUT GAYS AND ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION.
Stephen: REALLY?  OBSESSED WITH GAYS?  DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF, GAYS. IF ANYONE IS OBSESSED WITH THE GAYS, IT IS THE GAYS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ALL GAY FOR THEMSELVES. AND GET HOW THE SO-CALLED VICAR OF CHRIST JUSTIFIES HIS POSITION SAYING, THE PROCLAMATION OF THE SAVING LOVE OF GOD COMES BEFORE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS IMPER I WAS THE.
OH, LOVE BEFORE RULES?  LIKE THE BEST PART OF THE CATHOLICISM IS THE RULING KEEPING, IT IS THE SCORECARD FOR GETTING INTO HEAVEN PLUS I GET TO TELL PEOPLE THEY ARE GOING TO HELL WHEN THEY SCREW UP.
I KNOW JESUS SAYS JUDGE NOT OR YOU WILL BE JUDGED, THAT'S WHY I JUDGE PEOPLE FOR JUDGING ME.
NOW WE ARE STUCK WITH POPE KUMBAYA HERE. WELL, FOLKS, WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS SITTING DOWN, THEN STANDING UP AND KNEELING AND THEN STANDING UP AGAIN. THERE IS ONE PERSON IN THIS WORLD WITH THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO REPRIMAND THE INFALLIBLE BISHOP OF ROME, ME, STEPHEN COLBERT. AS ARCHBISHOP OF THE COLBERT NATION -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO CHOICE, BOYS, BRING OUT THE ON NOTICE BOARD. OH, OH. THIS IS HAPPENING. OKAY. LET'S SEE HERE. LET'S SEE HERE. I HAVE PONIES, PORPOISES, PALINDROMES, A MAN, A PLAN, A CANAL, PANAMA, ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, POPE FRANCIS. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. JORGE BERGOGLIO, STICK THIS IN YOUR CENTSER, SENSOR AND SMOKE IT, BOOM, RIGHT THERE!  OH, THAT HAS TO STING WORSE THAN THE 1054, HERE IS THE ANSWER FOR THE POPE HIMSELF. IT IS A MAN WHO -- IT IS THE MAN -- IT IS THE MAN WHO SUGGESTED THIS INTERVIEW, EDITOR AT LARGE OF AMERICA MAGAZINE AND CHAPLAIN OF THE COLBERT NATION, FATHER JIM MARTIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW YOU ARE THE ONE THAT GOT THE BALL ROLLING, RIGHT BECAUSE THE JESUITS SHOULD INTERVIEW A JESUIT POPE.
IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT, LIKE THIS SHOW. WHAT?
OKAY. THIS THING IS ABSOLUTELY CAUSING A SEISMIC RIPPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OF CATHOLICISM. THIS GUY SEEMS LIKE HE IS SAYING LOVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RULES. DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHAT HE IS SAYING?.  HE IS SAYING THAT AND THAT'S WHAT JESUS WAS SAYING AS WELL. SO HE IS BASICALLY SORT OF EMBODYING AND JUST EMULATING THE TEACHINGS OF JESUS AND KIND OF REMINDING US OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT IN THE CHURCH AND IT IS NOT RULES IT IS THE PERSON.
THEN WHY DON'T WE JUST BECOME HE PISS COPAILIANS AT THIS POINT AND TURN THE CHURCH INTO A COMMUNITY CENTER AND PLAY BASKETBALL.
THIS IS LIKE A LOS LEADER FOR THE CHURCH, IT IS LIKE THE SUMMERTIME .. WE ARE SELLING 11 CENTS A POUND WATERMELONS WHICH GETS THEM IN THE DOOR AND THEN BOOM, WE HIT THEM WAS $6.99 GRANOLA, EXCEPT THE WATERMELON IS LOVE AND GRANOLA IS THE RULES.
WELL SHE GETTING PEOPLE IN THE DOOR, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING ME THEY ARE COMING BACK TO THE CHURCH AS A RESULT OF HIM AND ALSO THIS INTERVIEW SPECIFICALLY.
I WAS JUST IN ROME AND YOU -- ST. PETER'S WAS PACKED, YOU COULD NOT SWING A CAT OVER THERE WITHOUT SOMEBODY SPRINKLING IT WITH HOLY WATER. OKAY.
HE GOT RID OF LIKE THE POPEMOBILE, RIGHT?
YEAH, HE DRIVES -- HE DRIVES HIMSELF --
THAT IS HELL ON EARTH.
THE GUYS ON CAR TALK --
THE POWER OF PRAYER.
WHAT THE SORT OF MORE CONSERVATIVE --
I AM CATHOLIC, YOU ARE CATHOLIC. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT BEING A CATHOLIC -- BENEDICT, WAS THAT YOU COULD GET IN A FIGHT, A POLITICAL FIGHT OVER SOCIAL ISSUES WITH ANOTHER CATHOLIC AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHO IS ON MY SIGH, THE POPE HE IS MY WING MAN AND THE POPE HAS A GREAT WING MAN BECAUSE HIS WING MAN IS JESUS.
BUT I CAN'T SAY THIS. HE IS TELLING ME NOT TO USE, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT ABORTION OR CONTRACEPTION OR GAY MARRIAGE AND THE DIVISIVE ISSUES.
WELL HE IS NOT SAYING THOSE THINGS ARE NOT IMPORTANT --
NOT AS FOCUSED ON, WHICH ARE LOVE, PASSION, MERCY.
STILL ACCUSE MY FELLOW CATHOLICS OF NOT BEING TRUE CATHOLICS IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THE POPE ON THESE ISSUES?
YOU CAN BUT JESUS DOESN'T WANT YOU TO JUDGE SO THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON YOU HAVE TO ANSWER TO.
Stephen: HMM. I SEE THAT.
FATHER JIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL BE RIGHT
