(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME EVERYBODY,  MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A *EUFL  RIGHTS PIONEER WHO FOUGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS IN THE SOUTH. I'LL ASK FOR VALID I.D. PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSMAN JOHN  LEWIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  CONGRESSMAN LEWIS, GOOD TO SEE  YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  COMING BACK.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: SIR, FOR THOSE OF  YOU WHO DO NOT KNOW YOUR C.V.,  YOU WERE A GIANT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, CHAIRMAN OF THE  NONVIOLENT STUDENT COORDINATING  COMMITTEE, THE YOUNGEST AND ONLY SURVIVING SPEAKER AT THE 1963  MARCH ON WASHINGTON WHEN  DR. KING GAVE THE "I HAVE A DREAM" SPEECH. YOU WERE A LEADER TO THE SELMA  TO MONTGOMERY MARCH AND A  RECIPIENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM AND PROFILES IN  COURAGE AWARD AND YOU HAVE A NEW  BOOK. I'M EXHAUSTED. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DON'T BE EXHAUSTED. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I WANT TO SAY THAT  YOU DO NOT OUTCIVIL RIGHTS  PIONEER ME. BECAUSE I HELD IN MY HAND THIS  IS A BANNER FROM THE MARCH ON  WASHINGTON, ALL RIGHT? GOT THAT. AUGUST 28, 1963, ALL RIGHT? THIS IS IN MY HAND BECAUSE I WAS  THERE. ALL RIGHT? IN MY MAMA'S BELLY. SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ME AND SHE  WAS AT THE "I HAVE A DREAM"  SPEECH SO DON'T FEEL ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY. I WAS AT THE "I HAVE A DREAM  SPEECH" TOO.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
IT WAS A LITTLE MUFFLED. AND I'M NOT SURE IF I'D  DEVELOPED EARS YET. BUT, YEAH, IT WAS --
I SPOKE NUMBER SIX AND  DR. KING SPOKE NUMBER TEN.
SO YOU WERE THE SIXTH PERSON  TO SPEAK. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, NEAR THE  END OF YOUR SPEECH YOU KEPT ON  SAYING "WAKE UP."
I'D SAY "WAKE UP, AMERICA."  AND HE SAID "I HAVE A DREAM."  SO WEREN'T YOU FIGHTING EACH  OTHER? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD  REMEMBER ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT DAY?
IT WAS AN UNBELIEVABLE DAY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF  AMERICANS CAME TOGETHER: BLACKS,  WHITES, LATINOS, ASIAN AMERICANS, NATIVE AMERICANS. MEN. WOMEN. CHILDREN. WHEN I WAS INTRODUCED, I LOOKED  UP OVER THAT AUDIENCE, THE SEA  OF HUMANITY, I SAW ALL OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ON MY RIGHT AND  THEN I LOOKED TO MY LEFT I SAW  MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE TREES. THEN I LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD I  SAW HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF  PEOPLE YOUNG AND OLD WITH THEIR FEET IN THE WATER TRYING TO COOL  OFF AND I SAID "THIS IS IT."  AND I STARTED SPEAKING.
Stephen: WERE YOU NERVOUS?
NO, I WAS NOT. I HAD BEEN ARRESTED AND GONE TO  JAIL MANY TIMES BY THE TIME OF  THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON. I MET WITH PRESIDENT KENNEDY A  FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE MARCH. AND PRESIDENT KENNEDY DIDN'T  LIKE THE IDEA OF BRINGING  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO WASHINGTON. HE SAID "IF YOU BRING ALL THEE  FOLKS TO WASHINGTON, WON'T THERE  BE VIOLENCE AND CHAOS AND DISORDER?"  WE SAID "NO, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS  WILL BE AN ORDERLY, PEACEFUL,  NONVIOLENT PROTEST." AND THE DAY OF THE MARCH, WHEN  THE MARCH WAS ALL OVER, HE  INVITED EACH ONE OF US, THE TEN OF US, BACK DOWN TO THE WHITE  HOUSE AND HE STOOD IN THE DOOR  OF THE OVAL OFFICE. HE WAS BEAMING LIKE A PROUD  FATHER, HE WAS JUST SMILING, HE  SAID "YOU DID A GOOD JOB. YOU DID A GOOD JOB."  HE SHOOK OUR HAND. WHEN HE GOT TO DR. KING HE SAID  "AND YOU HAD A DREAM."  AMERICA IS A BETTER AMERICA BECAUSE OF THE MARCH ON  WASHINGTON. AND WE ARE A BETTER PEOPLE. (APPLAUSE)  YOU NOW HAVE A GRAPHIC NOVEL  CALLED "MARCH, BOOK 1."  AND THIS IS A GRAPHIC NOVEL OF YOUR LIFE, HOW YOU WERE INSPIRED  TO JOIN THE CIVIL RIGHTS  MOVEMENT AND THIS IS THE MARCH ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTIS  BRIDGTON ROAD TO SELMA. AND THIS WAS FOR VOTING RIGHTS,  WASN'T IT?
IT WAS, PEOPLE IN SELMA, LIKE  SO MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE  SOUTH, COULD NOT REGISTER TO VOTE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF  THEIR SKIN. IN SELMA PEOPLE HAD TO STAND IN  WHAT WE CALLED UNMOVABLE LINES. YOU COULD ONLY ATTEMPT TO  REGISTER TO VOTE ON THE FIRST  AND THIRD MONDAY OF EACH MONTH.
Stephen: THE FIRST AND  THIRD MONDAY.
RIGHT. YOU HAD TO PASS A SO-CALLED  LITERACY TEST, PAY A POLL TAX. ON ONE OCCASION A MAN WAS ASKED  THE NUMBER OF BUBBLES IN A BAR  OF SOAP. ON ANOTHER OCCASION A MAN WAS  ASKED TO COUNT THE JELLY BEANS  IN A JAR.
Stephen: HOW MANY BUBBLES  ARE THERE IN A BAR OF SOAP?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: SHOULD YOU BE  ALLOWED TO VOTE THEN? I GUESS OBVIOUSLY -- EACH STATE  GETS TO SET THEIR OWN STANDARD. STATES ARE SETTING THEIR OWN  STANDARDS NOW.
BUT IT'S SO WRONG. IT'S SO WRONG.
Stephen: IF YOU CAN STICK  AROUND FOR ONE MINUTE, WE'LL  TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK AND COME BACK TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE  OTHER THINGS AND THE BOOK. THANKS SO MUCH, WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
