WHY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHY, WELL, FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT'S TUESDAY. (LAUGHTER) ASK ANYBODY, THEY'LL TELL YOU. BUT MOSTLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE IT'S DAY FIVE OF THE SOCHI WINTER GAMES. NOW I'M A BUSY MAN SO I'M NOT COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP ON THE OLYMPIC ACTION. I'VE BEEN TiVOING THEM AND LAST NIGHT I WAS THRILLED TO SEE THE TEAM USA GABBY DOUGLAS CLINCHED THE ALL-AROUND GYMNASTIC GOLD. TRULY HISTORIC. WAY TO GO, GABBY. AMERICA LOVES YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT I WAS EXCITED TO READ THAT TEAM USA HAS ALREADY WON SOME HUGE GOLDS IN SOCHI LIKE MEN'S AND WOMEN'S  SLOPESTYLE. I HAVE NO IDEA  WHAT THAT IS. I ASSUME IT'S FOR SHINIEST PARKA. FOLKS, I GOT TO SAY, THESE SOCHI GAMES, THESE OLYMPIC ATHLETES HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE IMPOSSIBLE. MAKING ME CARE ABOUT CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING. (LAUGHTER) AND OF COURSE THE GAMES HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART BECAUSE FOUR YEARS AGO I SAVED THE OLYMPICS. THE UNITED STATES SKI TEAM--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WOULD NEVER, WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE IT TO THE GAMES IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY HARD WORK AND YOUR HARD CASH. (LAUGHTER) I WENT WITH THE TEAM TO VANCOUVER AND BETWEEN US WE WON FOUR OLYMPIC MEDALS FOR SKATING AND ONE OVERSIZED SCOOBY DOO FOR WHACK-A-MOLE. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO WHO WON WHAT, IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT. AND I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON MY TEAM. THIS YEAR YOU CAN HELP THEM OUT BY GOING TO COLBERTNATION.COM AND DONATING AND GETTING YOUR OWN SPECIAL COLBERTNATION U.S. SPEED SKATING T-SHIRT. YOUR GREEN, FOLKS, YOUR GREEN CAN HELP THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE BRING HOME THE GOLD. ORANGE YOU GLAD? NOW FOLKS, I COULD NOT MAKE IT OVER TO SOCHI BECAUSE MY DOCTOR SAID I DON'T WANT TO. SO I AM SENDING SOMEONE ELSE TO BE MY EYES AND MY EARS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, MY NOSE. PLEASE WELCOME MY OLD FRIEND AND LONG TIME PRODUCER BUDDY COLE. BUDDY, THANKS SO MUCH MORE BEING HERE.

Stephen: BUDDY FEVER.

Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MAN.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN, THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.
Stephen: NOW BUDDY, YOU FOE GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS ARE UP IN ARMS OVER RUSSIA'S ANTI-HOMOSEXUAL PROPAGANDA LAWS. BUT THESE LAWS ARE SO VAGUE. THAT POLICE CAN ARREST ANYONE THEY SUSPECT AS BEING GAY. NOW OF COURSE I DONE WORRY ABOUT SENDING YOU. YOU ARE A REAL MAN'S MAN.
GUILTY AS CHARGED.
Stephen: POUND IT, YOU DOG. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. NOW FOLKS, BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY FRIENDS ON THE SPEED SKATING TEAM, BUDDY. HOW DO WE KEEP THEM SAFE?
WELL, STEVEN, LAST NIGHT I LEARNED. ALL ABOUT THIS ANTI-GAY LAWS WHEN I SAT DOWN WITH AN AMBASSADOR OF SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW, HE SEEMED NICE. AND TONIGHT I WANT TO SHARE THAT ADVICE WITH THE U.S. SPEED SKATING TEAM.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK I LOOK, BUDDY?
STEPHEN.
Stephen: JIM.
"THE COLBERT REPORT" PRESENTS A SPORT REPORT EXCLUSIVE, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
BUT NO GAY STUFF.
DOUBLE O 14.
WITH ME, BUDDY COLE.
I TRAVELED TO BEAUTIFUL SALT LAKE CITY TO MEET WITH THE U.S. SPEED SKATING TEAM BEFORE REALIZING IT WAS 12 MILES AWAY AT THE OLYMPIC IN KEARNS, UTAH.
LET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. MY NAME IS BUDDY COLE AND I'VE BEEN SENT HERE BY STEPHEN COLBERT TO HELP YOU FELLAS AVOID APPEARING GAY AND GETTING ARRESTED IN RUSSIA. ARE ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN AWARE OF THESE ANTI-GAY LAWS THAT RUSSIA HAS PASSED.
YEAH, WE'RE AWARE OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN RUSSIA. BUT HONESTLY, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN TRAINING SO MUCH AND CONCENTRATING ON OUR TRAINING,.
NO TIME FOR GAY SEX.
IS THERE ANYONE ON YOUR TEAM THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE ANTI-GAY LAW CURIOUS.
I DON'T THINK SO.
SO YOU DON'T KNOW ANY SPEED SKATERS THAT ARE GAY? DO YOU KNOW ANY FIGURE SKATERS THAT ARE STRAIGHT?
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. RIDICULOUS, OF COURSE NOT.
WHY ARE THERE NO WOMEN ON THE MEN'S SPEED SKATING TEAM, THAT SEEMS VERY GAY.
WELL, THEY HAVE A WOMEN'S TEAM TOO.
OH. IS SPEED SKATING A CHOICE OR WERE YOU BORN A SPEED SKATER?
YOU'RE BORN A SPEED SKATER.
SO YOU WERE BORN A SPEED SKATER.
YES.
WAS'S YOUR NAME.
KYLE CARR I'M SHORT TRACK. I DO SHORT TRACK.
YOU ARE A SHORT TRACKER. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, KYLE, IT'S A LITTLE COLD IN HERE.
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF, WHERE ARE YOU FROM.
I'M FROM TEXAS.
TEXAS, VERY HETEROSEXUAL BUT I READ IN YOUR CV THAT YOU SPENT SOME TIME IN FRANCE.
YES, I DID, YES.
OOH. I WOULD DEEMPHASIZE THE FRANCE, MORE TEXAS, LESS FRANCE.
WHAT'S YOUR STORY, WHAT ARE YOU ALL ABOUT.
FROM WASHINGTON.
WHAT IS WITH THIS BIEBER HAIRCUT. IT'S A LITTLE LESBIAN. THIS IS FUNNY, THIS IS SERIOUS, BOYS.
NOW I WAS READING IN YOUR BIO THAT YOU HAD A PRETTY NASTY INJURY, TELL ME ALL ABOUT THAT.
CUT MY LEG FOUR YEARS AGO. I PUT THE FRONT OF MY RIGHT BLADE INTO MY LEG.
SO YOU HAVE LIKE A BIG MANLY SCAR ON YOUR INNER THIGH.
I DO, I SHOW IT OFF ALL THE TIME.
CHICKS DIG SCARS, RIGHT. YOU BOYS KNOW THAT. OH, I AM COVERED WITH SCARS. I'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF THEM. SOME OF THEM PHYSICAL.
ALVAREZ, SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATER FROM FLORIDA.
YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF GONZALEZES ON THE ICE, DO YOU,.
ALVAREZ.
OR ALVAREZES. OH, IT SAYS HERE JORDAN.
YES.
YOU ARE AN INVENTOR.
I DID CREATE SOME THINGS.
WHAT DID YOU INVENT.
I MADE THE TIPS THAT WE USE ON OUR GLOVES SO YOUR FINGERS DON'T RUB ON YOUR EYES.
SO YOUR DELICATE FINGERS DON'T GET ALL SCRATCHED BY THE ICE. SO IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT WHAT YOU INVENTED WAS FINGERTIP CONDOMS.
SLIGHTLY TOUGHER THAN THAT.
SO WHAT METALS ARE YOU GUYS HOPING TO WIN.
GOLD.
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO WIN GOLD?
WIN.
WIN! EXACTLY. THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER. YOU KNOW THOUGH, HERE'S THE THING, ANYONE CAN WIN GOLD, RIGHT, ANYONE. ALL YOU HAVE TO TO DO IS BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, REAL WINNING IS IN THE FACE. YOU ALL WANT TO BE GOLD MEDAL WINNERS BUT ARE YOU READY TO BE STARS? IT'S ALL IN THE FACE LIKE HERE'S ME, LISTEN, I'M CROSSING THE FINISH LINE. I'VE GOT SOME RIDICULOUS SOUTH KOREAN BEHIND ME BECAUSE I HATE THOSE SOUTH KOREANS. HE'S JUST BEHIND ME AND THEN I CRASH THROUGH THE TAPE. (APPLAUSE) CAN I SEE YOUR WINNING GOLD MEDAL FACES. COME ON, NOW! EXACTLY! THIS HAS BEEN GREAT. BUT LET'S HEAD OUT ON TO THE ICE TO MAKE SURE THAT I KEEP YOU AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AT THE SOCHI OLYMPICS.
MOVE IT. TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE TEAM I KNEW I HAD TO WALK A MILE IN THEIR SHOES OR AT LEAST SKATE A KILOMETER IN THEIR SPANDEX. KILOMETER IN THEIR SPANDEX.
I'LL BE IN, WITH YOU IN A SECOND. KEEP SKATING. KEEP SKATING. OKAY.
OH! I'M FINE! I'M GOOD. OH MY GOODNESS. WOULD YOU GRAB MY TAIL.
THEY CLEARLY KNEW HOW TO ICE CONGA AND THAT WAS PERFECTLY BUTCH. AS WAS THE RELAY HANDOFF. BUT THERE WAS NO HIDING THE FACT THAT THEIR TIGHTS SCREAMED GAY PROPAGANDA. I HAD TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THEM LESS ATTRACTIVE. FANNIE PACKS. DAMMIT, NOT EVEN DOCKERS COULD DAMPEN THOSE FIERY THIGHS. FINALLY I HAD TO RESORT TO GAY KRYPTONITE, CROCS.
THAT'S BETTER.
OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC. YOU LOOK HIDEOUS. HETEROSEXUALITY ACHIEVED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: GREAT REPORT, BUDDY.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU DID IT AGAIN. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE OUT IN THE FIELD DO WHAT THIS GUY DOES. YOU'RE AMAZING.
THANKS.
Stephen: GREAT REPORT, BUDDY.
WELL, I CERTAINLY ENJOYED IT.
