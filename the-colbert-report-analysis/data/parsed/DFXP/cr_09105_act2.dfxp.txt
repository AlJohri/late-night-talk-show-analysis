[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, IN CASE YOU JUST JOINED  OUR BROADCAST, IN THE A-BLOCK OF  TONIGHT'S PROGRAM, WE DISCOVERED THAT MY 501(C)4, COLBERT SUPER  PAC SHH WAS TARGETED BY THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DESPITE THE FACT THAT EVER SINCE THE SCANDAL  BROKE THE I.R.S. HAS APPROVED  DOZENS OF CONSERVATIVE TEA PARTY  GROUPS. YEAH, THE SCANDAL BREAKS AND THE  I.R.S. CAVES FASTER THAN A  SPELUNKER ON METH. HERE TO TELL ME WHY I AM ON  OBAMA'S HIT LIST, PLEASE WELCOME  GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE 2008 McCAIN CAMPAIGN, FORMER F.E.C. CHAIRMAN AND MY PERSONAL LAWYER  TREVOR POTTER IN THE MAZDA  SCANDAL BOOTH. TREVOR POTTER, EVERYBODY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TREVOR, THANKS SO MUCH. HAVE A SEAT. ALL RIGHT. NOW, TREVOR, LET'S TALK SCANDAL. THIS I.R.S. THING IS ACTUALLY  BAD. ISN'T IT?
IT IS. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE  I.R.S. AND THOSE EMPLOYEES DID  SOMETHING THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE
Stephen: LET'S GET TO THE  HEAT OF THE MEAT. WHY HAS MY APPLICATION FOR  TAX-EXEMPT STATUS FOR MY 501(C)4  NEVER BEEN GRANTED?
BECAUSE WE NEVER FILED IT. Stephen: BUT I HAVE A  501(C)4.
YES, YOU DO. IT'S DELAWARE CORPORATION.
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S DOING BUSINESS  Stephen: HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HAVE PASSED  THROUGH IT.
AT LEAST  Stephen: NOW HOW IS THAT  POSSIBLE THAT I DIDN'T APPLY? AM I BREAKING THE LAW?
NO. YOUR LAWYERS ADVISED YOU THAT  THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT  THAT YOU FILE WITH THE I.R.S. AN APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION
Stephen: SO, WAIT A SECOND. SO YOU CAN FORM A 501(C)4  WITHOUT ASKING TO FORM ONE.
RIGHT  Stephen: SO THESE TEA PARTY  ANTI-BIG GOVERNMENT  ORGANIZATIONS DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK BIG GOVERNMENT FOR PERMISSION,  BUT THEY DID ANYWAY?
RIGHT. Stephen: WHAT? WHAT A BUNCH OF PUSSIES.   ( APPLAUSE )   OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THE I.R.S. IS TAKING A LOT OF  HEAT.
A LOT OF HEAT  Stephen: ANYONE WHO APPLIED  FOR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS RIGHT NOW, LIKE CONSERVATIVE TEA PARTY  ORGANIZATIONS THE I.R.S. WOULD  BE UNDER SOME PRESSURE TO APPROVE THEM. WOULDN'T THEY?
THAT WOULD PUT THEM IN A VERY  AWKWARD POSITION. IT WOULD LOOK POLITICAL.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS LIKE  SOMETHING I WOULD LIKE TO DO. OKAY. SO COULD I APPLY NOW?
YEAH  Stephen: OKAY. WHERE WOULD I GET AN  APPLICATION?
YOUR LAWYER WOULD DRAFT ONE  FOR YOU, A 1024, GIVE IT TO YOU  TO SIGN AND THEN WE'D FILE IT
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW OF  ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE ONE OF  THOSE?
I JUST HAPPEN TO, YES. IT'S RIGHT HERE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. TREVOR, CAN I FILE UNDER A  DIFFERENT NAME BECAUSE COLBERT  SUPER PAC SHHH ISN'T  SUFFICIENTLY TEA PARTY ENOUGH FOR ME.
SURE. YOU CAN DO A NICKNAME LIKE A  "DOING BUSINESS AS" NAME
Stephen: SOMETHING TO PUT A  LITTLE BIT MORE PRESSURE ON THE  I.R.S., OKAY. I WAS THINKING MAYBE "MAKING  AMERICA A BETTER TEA PARTY  PATRIOT 9-12 PLACE TO  CONSTITUTION AMERICA TEA PARTY NOMINALLY SOCIAL WELFARE  CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL ACTION  TEA PARTY SECRET MONEY LIBERTY I DARE YOU TO DENY THIS  APPLICATION OF AMERICA TEA PARTY   PARTY."
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT. Stephen: ALL RIGHT. RIGHT HERE?
RIGHT THERE  Stephen: THERE THAT IS AND,  TREVOR, LET'S DO THIS THING. TREVOR POTTER.
THANK YOU. Stephen: TREVOR POTTER, WE'LL  BE RIGHT BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
