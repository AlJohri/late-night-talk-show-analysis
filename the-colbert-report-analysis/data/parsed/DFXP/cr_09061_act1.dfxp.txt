Stephen: THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING SEE IT --  STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, FRIENDS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  WITH AN ARMY LIKE YOU AT MY  BACK, I'M READY TO GO TO BATTLE ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND IT'S TIME TO MARCH AGAIN  BECAUSE THERE'S NO GETTING  AROUND IT, FOLKS WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. LAST NIGHT'S STATE OF THE UNION  ADDRESS. BIG WHUP-IDITDO. WHAT TYPE OF NARCISSISTIC JERK  EXPECTS PEOPLE TO TUNE IN TO  HEAR A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE MINDLESSLY CHEER HIM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS PATHETIC. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO HERE SMOKES POT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHY I  SUBJECT MYSELF TO LAST NIGHT'S  SOCIALIST STROKE JOB BECAUSE IT WAS MORE OF THE SAME OLD, SAME  OLD NEW IDEAS. IT WAS NOTHING BUT A NOTHING  BURGER WITH ALL THE FIXINS. LAUGH STILL NOTHING BURGER  PRETTY TASTY IF YOU SMOKE WEED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PATHETIC. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FOLKS, IT JUST CONFIRMED HOW  OUT OF TOUCH THE PRESIDENT IS.
SIMPLE FACT, THE MORE  EDUCATION YOU'VE GOT, THE MORE  LIKELY YOU ARE TO HAVE A GOOD JOB AND WORK YOUR WAY TO THE  MIDDLE CLASS. A RISING LIVE ITING MIDDLE  CLASS, MIDDLE CLASS.
Jon: MIDDLE CLASS, REALLY  GRANDPA? WE HAVEN'T HAD A MIDDLE CLASS  SINCE THE 90s. WHAT IS YOUR NEXT BIG IDEA  TRAVEL AGENCIES THAT ADVERTISE  ON CASSETTE TAPES. YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY WITH  THE MIDDLE CLASS TALK. THIS SPEECH WAS ABOUT ONE THING  ONLY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES THE  GOVERNMENT IS THE SOLUTION, MORE  GOVERNMENT.
BIG GOVERNMENT.
BIG GOVERNMENT.
BIG GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS THE MOST  PROGOVERNMENT SPEECH SINCE  LYNDON JOHNSON.
Stephen: YES, I FIND IT  OFFENSIVE THAT THE HEAD OF OUR  GOVERNMENT WOULD GIVE A SPEECH TO EVERYONE ELSE IN THE  GOVERNMENT THAT WAS SO  PRO-GOVERNMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT TO MENTION, THE PRESIDENT  IMMEDIATELY DECLARED WAR ON THE  PRIVATE SECTOR.
TONIGHT, LET'S DECLARE THAT  IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON  EARTH, NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL TIME SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN  POVERTY AND RAISE THE FEDERAL  MINIMUM WAGE TO $9 AN HOUR.
Stephen: $9? THAT IS ALMOST TWO FEET OF  SANDWICH. WHERE DOES IT END? WHERE DID IT END? A LIVING WAGE SPOILS THE WORKING  MAN. JUST ASK C.E.O. AND FOX NEWS  RESIDENT SMEAGOL ROBERT LUDDY. JIM?
I WORKED FOR $85 CENTS AN  HOUR WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL  AND I WAS HAPPY TO HAVE THAT  JOB.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I'M  TALKING. AMERICA HAS GONE SOFT. IF EVERYONE IS LIVING THE  FANTASY LIFE OF COLD AND HEAT  THEY'LL HAVE NO DRIVE. IT'S THAT SUFFERING THAT LIFTS  PEOPLE UP TO START THEIR OWN  BUSINESS AND ONE DAY BECOME A JOB CREATOR LIKE MR. LUDDY WHO  LOBBIES TO FIGHT AGAINST RAISING  THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE HE WAS SO (bleep) POOR HE HAD TO  FIGHT OFF RATS WITH A SPAT LA. WHO IS INFECTED WITH RABIES. YES, YOU ARE. [ LAUGHTER ] BESIDES, PRESIDENT IF I DFIDE --  FIDEL HANDOUT HERE SAID NOTHING  ABOUT RAISING THE MAXIMUM WAGE. FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER  EARNING MORE THAN I CAN EVER  NEED BUT FOLKS CAN I IMAGINE EVEN MORE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, THAT WASN'T HIS ONLY  SHOCK JOBS PROGRAM.
TONIGHT I PROPOSE A FIX-IT  FIRST PROGRAM TO PUT PEOPLE TO  WORK ON THE MOST URGENT REPAIRS, LIKE THE NEARLY 70,000  STRUCTURALLY DEOFFICIAL  BRIDGES -- DEFICIENT BRIDGES  ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: WOW, 70,000  STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT DEATH  TRAPS. ON YOUR WAY TO YOUR NEW MINIMUM  WAGE JOB YOU WANT TO TAKE THE  ALTERNATE ROUTE AROUND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER THROUGH  CANADA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THE BIGGEST -- I BELIEVE THE  THE BIGGEST FAILURE OF THE NIGHT  WAS HOW A BALMA KEPT UNLOADING HIS WORK TO US.
WE MUST DO MORE TO COMBAT  CLIMATE CHANGE. AMERICA MUST FACE THE THREAT OF  SIGNER ATTACKS. AMERICA MUST REMAIN A BEACON TO  ALL WHO SEEK FREEDOM. WE MUST ALL DO OUR PART. WE CAN GET IT DONE. NOW IS THE TIME TO GET IT DONE. NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT.
Jon: UG.
Stephen: UHG. ARRGH. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK,  MAN. WHY DO WE -- WHY DO WE ALWAYS  HAVE TO FACE OUR GLOBAL  CHALLENGES? WHY CAN'T AMERICA TAKE A  PERSONAL YEAR? JUST SOME TIME TO GET OUR  (bleep) TOGETHER. MAYBE FOCUS ON OUR MUSIC,  THROARN HOME BREW? -- LEARN TO HOME BREW? WHATEVER. NO, NO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO, WHATEVER. I GUESS WE'LL ADDRESS OUR  CHALLENGES. OF COURSE, OBAMA WAS JUST THE  OPENING ACT FOR FORTNIGHT'S MAIN E--  FOR THE NIGHT'S MAIN EVENT THE LONG AWAITED RUBIO ADDRESS GIVEN  BY FLORIDA SENATOR AND BOARD  CERTIFICATEIFIED MINORITY MARCO  RUBIO.
RUBIO WITH THE REPUBLICANS  HAVE PROBABLY ONE OF BEST  COMMUNICATORS SINCE RONALD  REAGAN.
ALL EYES ON OUR RISING STAR. I MIGHT SAY OUR ONLY STAR.
Stephen: NO PRESSURE MARCO,  YOU ARE JUST THE EGG FROM WHICH  THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL BE BORN SO WE SHOULD PUT ALL OUR  EGG INTO ONE BASKET AND THEN  COUNT OUR CHICKEN BEFORE IT HATCHES AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT  WHY NOT MAKE THE A HAND BASKET  AND TAKE IT SOME PLACE REALLY  WARM.
I'M MARCO RUBIO. I HAVE THE HONOR OF RESPONDING  TO THE STATE OF THE UNION  ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW  REPUBLICANS. THE FAVORITE ATTACK IS THAT  THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE DON'T AGREE  WITH THEM ONLY CARE ABOUT RICH  PEOPLE. ONE OF THINGS FOR GROWTH IS THE  EMERGENCY INDUSTRY OVER THE NEXT  DECADE. [LAUGHTER] NOTHING HAS FRUSTRATED ME MORE  THAN FALSE CHOICES LIKE THE ONE  THE PRESIDENT LAID OUT TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: DON'T WORRY,  SENATOR RUBIO, NOBODY NOTICED  THAT YOU GAVE A SPEECH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK -- I SAY PERSONALLY I  THINK IT'S A BOLD MOVE TO DUCK  OFF CAMERA DURING THE BIGGEST SPEECH OF YOUR LIFE. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT HE WAS  THINKING. JIMMY, DO YOU HAVE ANY FOOTAGE  OF WHAT HE WAS THINKING?
IF WE CAN GROW OUR ENERGY  INDUSTRY, IT WILL MAKE US ENERGY  INDEPENDENT. ♪ ♪ [LAUGHTER] FALSE CHOICES LIKE THE ONE THE  PRESIDENT LAID OUT TONIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: FOLKS, ULTIMATELY  IS THIS REALLY THAT BIG OF A  DEAL JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT PEOPLE WILL EVER  REMEMBER? [LAUGHTER] WE TURN TO FOX NEWS.
I COULD SEE FOR THE FIRST  TIME THAT HE WAS NERVOUS.
IT WAS VERY AWKWARD. THIS RESPONSE IS ALWAYS A TOUGH  SPOT. HERE YOU ARE IN A ROOM WITH  CAMERAS AND ALL THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, HOT CAMERA  AND ALL THAT IT'S A UNIQUE  SITUATION. WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT YOU ARE  NEVER UNDER PRESSURE. LET ME, FOLKS, LET ME TELL YOU  FROM EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT EASY  BEING ON TV. YOU'VE GOT THE SWELTERING  LIGHTS, AUDIENCE, THE CAMERAS,  YOU KNOW, KNOWING YOU ARE BEING WATCHED BY MILLIONS THAT THEY  ARE JUDGING YOUR EVERY MOVE  AND -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THEY MAKE THE BIGGEST THINGS  OUT OF SMALLEST MISTAKES. CAN REALLY GIVE A PERSON A  LITTLE BIT OF COTTON MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WATER WHERE  YOU NEED IT BUT THAT'S NOT  REALLY A PROBLEM BECAUSE A TRUE PROFESSIONAL KNOWS, YOU KNOW,  HOW TO COVER. YOU COVER YOUR PROBLEM BY ALWAYS  MAINTAINING EYE CONTACT WITH THE  HOME VIEWER AND CONNECTING WITH THE AUDIENCE ON A HUMAN LEVEL,  MAKE THEM OVERLOOK YOUR  DIFFICULTIES, JUST KEEP THE WORDS COMING AND NO ONE WILL  NOTICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JUST NEVER LOSE EYE CONTACT. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, YOU MAY NOT HAVE NOTICE I  GOT A LITTLE THIRSTY THERE BUT  THAT'S HOW PROS LIKE ME AND MARCO RUBIO DO IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
