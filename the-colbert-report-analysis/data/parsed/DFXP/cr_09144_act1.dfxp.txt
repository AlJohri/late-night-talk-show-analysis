AND MY GUEST IS GRAMMY  AWARD-WINNING ACOUSTIC  LEDGEnd JOHN PRIN, AFTER THE  COLBERT BUMP, MAYBE HE'LL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY AN  ELECTRIC GUITAR. HAPPY ROSH HASHANAH, WHICH  WE ALL KNOW IS THE JEWISH  HOLIDAY OF I HAVE NO IDEA. MY RIDERS ALL LEFT EARLY. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by      COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME TO  THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE  GOT TO SAY --
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT CAN I SAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. FOLKS, FOLKS, I WANT TO  THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR  LETTING ME LATCH ON TO YOU  LIKE AN EMOTIONAL LAMPREY AN SUCK THE JOY FROM YOUR YOUNG  VITAL BODIES UNTIL THEY ARE  AS DRY AS A CROUTON. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BECAUSE FOLKS,  THERE'S A LOT OF DEPRESSING  NEWS OUT THERE. CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA,  RADIATION IN FUKUSHIMA,  BREAKING BAD IS ENDING. EVEN WORSE, I'M STARTING TO  THINK THAT HANK AND WALT MAY  NOT END UP TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHEN I  NEED A LITTLE PICK ME UP, I  ALWAYS DIP INTO STEPHEN COLBERT'S SMILE FILE. TONIGHT'S SMILE FILE, ARIEL  CASTRO. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS, YOU MIGHT BE  SAYING STEPHEN ARIEL CASTRO  IS A VIAL MONSTER WHOSE SUICIDE THIS WEEK IS JUST  THE DARKENED TO A DARK LIFE. HOW CAN ANYTHING ASSOCIATED  WITH THAT MAN POSSIBLY MAKE  ME SMILE? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. UNTIL I TUNED IN TO FOX  NEWS'S THE FIVE STARRING  ERIC BOLLING WHO ALWAYS  CEASE THE GLASS AS HALF  FULL.
ARIEL CASTRO THE  PEDOPHILE PIECE OF YOU KNOW  WHAT WHO HELD THREE GIRLS CAPTIVE IN CLEVELAND FOR  DECADES WAS CONVICTED AND  SENTENCED TO LIFE PLUS 1,000 YEARS BEHIND BARINGS, LAST  NIGHT THE COW WARD HUNG  HIMSELF FAR SHORT OF THE THE 33 KERR -- YEARS, HE SPENT  33 YEARS, THINK OF THE TAX  DOLLAR DOLLAR-- TAXPAYER  DOLLARS HE SAVED. HERE IS THE 3457, ARIEL DOS  TRO, LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 79,  30 GRANDE YEAR, $780,000 TAXPAYER DOLLARS WE SAVED BY  HIM HANGING HIMSELF.
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD  POINT. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. JUSTICE IS  EXTENSION-- EXPENSIVE. IMAGINE HOW MUCH WE COULD  HAVE SAVED IF WE NEVER  CAUGHT HIM. AND AND FOLKS, THE BOLLING  SUNSHINE EXPRESS DID NOT END  AT CASTRO AND A PLAYFUL CARTOON OF THE NEWS, NO. BOLLING HAD A WAY TO SAVE  AMERICA EVEN MORE MONEY. HOW ABOUT GITMO, $903,000  PER YEAR PER GITMO DETAINEE. THAT'S $150 MILLION A YEAR  WE WOULD SAVE IN GITMO IF  THEY WOULD ALL JUST DO THE SAME THING.
Stephen: THANK YOU. I MEAN WOULD IT KILL THOSE  GITMO DETAINEES TO KILL  THEMSELVES? FOR PETE'S SAKE WHAT ARE  THEY WAITING FOR, CHARGES? AND IF YOU LOOK AT HIS WHITE  BOARD BOLLING HAS ALREADY  GOT SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD TAKE THE NEXT  EXIT RAMP TO DIRT NAP CITY. HE'S GOT NIDAL HASAN, KHALID  CHIC MOHAMMED AND@ERIC  BOLLING?
OH GOD! OH GOD DON'T DO IT, ERIC,  YOU'VE GOT SOME OF TO LIVE  FOR. NOTHING'S COMING TO ME NOW  BUT ONE IMAGINES. BUT FOLKS, FOLKS-- PEOPLE,  THE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING FOR  YOU, ERIC, LIKE TINKER BELL, LIKE TINKER BELL WITH A GUN  IN HER MOUTH. BUT FOLKS, BOLLING REALLY  GOT ME, I WANT TO SAY  THINKING. THE COUNTRY COULD SAVE SO  MUCH MORE MONEY IF LIKE ERIC  BOLLING WE ARE WILLING TO PUT A PRICE TAG ON HUMAN  LIFE SO I SAY FORGET PRISONS  LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  SUICIDAL ELEMENT IN THE  ROOM. SOCIAL SECURITY. AT $815 BILLION DOLLARS A  YEAR, PEPAW IT'S TIME TO  SMEAR THE STAIRS WITH SOME  OF THAT PUDDING AND JUST SLIP AGAINLY INTO THAT GOOD  NIGHT. AND IF ANY OF YOU  FREELOADERS OUT THERE NEED  SOME INSPIRATION, JUST TURN  ON THE FIVE. BECAUSE EVERY TIME I WATCH  ERIC BOLLING, I WANT TO KILL  MYSELF. (APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, IT'S ELECTION SEASON  HERE IN THE BIG APPLE. WE'RE CHOOSING A NEW MAYOR  TO REPLACE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG  WHO--   (LAUGHTER)  WHO SADLY WAS LOST IN THE COUCH CUSHONS AT GRACEY  MANSION. PRIMARIES ARE ON TUESDAY BUT  IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE BECAUSE  THIS TIME NO ONE IS  ADDRESSING THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF THE THE-- LAST WEEK  NEW YORK FACED A CRISIS THAT  COULD TURN THE TIDE OF THIS  ELECTION.
TWO LOST KITTENS BRING AN  ENTIRE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY  LINE TO A STAND STILL.
TRAIN CREWS SHUT OFF THE  POWER. IT DID HOLD UP TRAINS FOR  TWO HOURS, DELAYING  THOUSANDS OF COMMUTERS.
AMERICA'S LARGEST  TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM  BROUGHT TO A SCREECHING HALT,  ALL BECAUSE OF THIS FURY  DUO.
KITTENS, SHUT DOWN SUBWAY  SERVICE.
Stephen: TUCKER-MEOW  RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  THESE SUBWAY KIT KENS  PARALYZED TRANSIT SERVICE IN  BROOKLYN IT WAS CHAOS. HUNDREDS OF BROOKLYNNITES  WERE STUCK ON THE PLATFORM  WITH NOTHING TO INSTA GRAM. THOUSANDS OF BARISTAS WERE  LATE FOR THEIR SHIFTS. WORSE OF ALL DOZENS OF BANDS  WERE INSTANTLY FORMED TO  NAME THE SUBWAY KITTENS. NEW YORK'S MAYORRAL  CANDIDATES--   (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IN RESPONSE TO  THE CRISIS NEW YORK MAYORRAL  CANDIDATES IMMEDIATELY WEIGHED IN. A SPOKESMAN FOR SHOCKINGLY  CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR BE  THONNY WEINER TOLD IF AN  ANTHONY SAID IF HE WILL NOT ONLY STOP TRAINS FOR KITTENS,  WILL PERSONALLY CHROIM OVER  THE THIRD RAIL TO DO IT. I FOR ONE BELIEVE ANTHONY  WEINER WOULD NEVER HARM A  KITTEN THOUGH HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF CHOKING THE  CHICKEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW WEINER'S RESPONSE WAS  ECHOED BY FELLOW CANDIDATES  CHRISTINE QUEEN, BILL THOMPSON AND SAL ALBANY WHO  SAID WHAT ARE WE NUT, OF  COURSE I WOULD HAVE STOPPED. WE CAN'T JUST GO RUNNING  OVER KITTENS. (LAUGHTER)  CAN'T, SAL, OR WON'T? BECAUSE THERE'S ONE  POLITICIAN OUT THERE WITH  THE COURAGE TO GREASE OUR  TRACKS WITH CAT BABIES. REPUBLICAN JOE LHOTA WHOSE  CAMPAIGN WHEN ASKED ABOUT  THE KITTENS RESPONDED THAT LHOTA DOES NOT THINK IT'S  APPROPRIATE TO SHUT DOWN AN  ENTIRE TRAIN LINE FOR AN  EXTENDED PERIOD FOR THIS  PURPOSE. FOLKS THIS IS A SHREWD  POLITICAL MOVE. THINK ABOUT IT, LHOTA IS THE  ONLY PRO DEAD KITTEN  CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE. OR ANY RACE. AND I SAY HE SHOULD RUN WITH  THIS. WHAT BETTER WAY TO GRAB  ATTENTION THAN WITH YARD  SIGNS THAT SAY JOE LHOTA  DEAD KITTENS. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN ALL THESE OTHER  CANDIDATES ARE JUST GOING TO  SPLIT PROT KITTEN VOTERS LEAVING JOE TO SWEEP UP IN  THE KEY ANTI-KITTEN  DEMOGRAPHIC OF SOCIOPATH,  RATS LARGE ENOUGH TO VOTE AND ALF. AND THESE, THESE TWO  TROUBLEMAKERS NAMED AUGUST  AND ARTHUR HAD IT COMING. THEY CALL THIS A MAJOR  TRANSPORTATION DELAY IN THE  LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY  MAKING THE BAD, BAD KITTENS. NOW I WOULD LOVE TO TELL  THEM THAT TO THEIR FACE AND  I WILL. PLEASE WELCOME AUGUST ARTHUR  AND THE MAN WHO TOOK THEM IN,  STEPHEN LEW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THARMTIONS SO-- THANKS SOME  OF.
LOOK AT THAT, WELCOME,  STEPHEN, HOW ARE THE KITTENS  DOING?
THEY'RE GREAT. GREAT.
ENOUGH OF THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
BECAUSE I'M READY TO OPEN  DOORS IN THE MAYORRAL RACE  AND JOE LHOTA IS LOOKING  GOOD. BUT FIRST SIR, YOU HAVE TO  PROVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO  KITTYCIDE, YOU DON'T JUST TALK THE TALK, YOU EVEN KILL  THESE KITTENS. ANYWAY YOU WANT. BARRY?
THAT'S RIGHT, STEPHEN. FOR HIS KITTEN KILLING, JOE  LHOTA CAN CHOOSE FROM A BAT,  A 10 INCH DROP BOARD KNIFE, HIS CHOICE OF HAMMER, MONKEY  WRENCH OR A CLASSIC BURLAP  BAG FILLED WITH ROCKS TO TOSS INTO THE EAST RIVER. ALL THIS PLUS THE COLBERT  BUMP CAN BE YOURS JOE LHOTA  IF YOU'LL JUST --
KILL THAT KITTEN.
Stephen: MR. LHOTA I WILL  BE WAITING FOR YOU IN MY  STUDIO BUT PLEASE TAKE A  CAR. THE SUBWAY IS INFESTED WITH  THESE MONSTERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
