Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN! '] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU  WITH US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. GLAD YOU ARE WITH ME HERE  TONIGHT. NATION, AL GORE SHOULD BE  TURNING OVER IN HIS GRAVE, [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE IT'S MARCH 6TH AND IT IS  STILL WINTER. [LAUGHTER] A MASSIVE STORM IS SWEEPING THE  COUNTRY, SO I HOPE YOU'RE  BUNDLED UP SOMEWHERE WARM, SURROUNDED BY YOUR LOVED ONES. PARTICULARLY YOUR SLOW MOVING,  WELL-MARBLED LOVED ONES. [LAUGHTER] YOU NEVER KNOW. NOW, THIS YEAR THE WEATHER  CHANNEL HAS TAKEN TO NAMING  ALL THE WINTER STORMS, THEY'RE CALLING THIS ONE WINTER STORM  SATURN. PERSONALLY, I WOULD HAVE GONE  WITH URANUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE  THEY ARE PULLING THESE NAMES  FROM. [LAUGHTER] BESIDES, THE REST OF THE MEDIA  HAS A MUCH BETTER NAME FOR THE  STORM.
THE DREADED "S" WORD,  SNOWQUESTER.
SNOWQUESTER.
SNOWQUESTER.
SNOWQUESTER.
SNOWQUESTER, RIGHT? > THEY'RE CALLING IT SNOWQUESTER  WHICH I THINK IS GREAT.
ISN'T THAT CUTE? I THINK IT'S CUTE. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: IT IS CUTE. AND DEADLY. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THE SNOWQUESTER IS A  COMBINATION OF SNOW AND THE  SEQUESTER. NATION, I THINK THIS FANTASTIC  AND RIDICULOUS. OR, FANTASTICULOUS. [LAUGHTER] WE SHOULD NAME ALL OF OUR  WEATHER EVENTS AFTER WHAT KIND  THEY ARE PLUS WHATEVER PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ON TELEVISION  AT THE TIME. TODAY, A WASHINGTON IS BLANKETED  IN THE SNOWQUESTER, TOMORROW, A  STORM COVERS NEW YORK IN  DRONE-CICLES. [LAUGHTER] OR A FREAK BLIZZ-ARDASHIAN. AS WE SPEAK OKLAHOMA IS  STILL SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF  POPE BENE-DROUGHT THE 16TH? [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, ISN'T THAT CUTE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] KIND OF CUTE. ANYWAY, I THINK THAT'S CUTE  OVER TO YOU STEPHEN. THANKS, STEVE! [LAUGHTER] NATION, NO ONE IS A BIGGER FAN  OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT  THAN YOURS TRULY. I EVEN ATTENDED 1963'S HISTORIC  MARCH ON WASHINGTON-- AND  THIS IS TRUE-- WHILE STILL IN MY MOTHER'S WOMB. [LAUGHTER] I'LL NEVER FORGET MARTIN LUTHER  KING'S STIRRING WORDS. [HEARTBEAT SOUNDS] [MUFFLED VOICE] [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY I'M PERSONALLY  INVESTED IN A CHALLENGE TO THE  1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT NOW BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S RIGHT. THE LAW THAT BANNED THE  SILENCING OF AFRICAN AMERICANS  IS FINALLY COMING BEFORE OUR NATION'S FOREMOST SILENT  AFRICAN-AMERICAN. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, BEFORE THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT BLACK PEOPLE WERE  REGULARLY KEPT FROM VOTING WITH ROADBLOCKS LIKE LITERACY TESTS,  POLL TAXES, AND "YOU MUST BE  THIS WHITE TO VOTE" SIGNS. [LAUGHTER] NOW THAT LAW IS BEING CHALLENGED  IN THE SUPREME COURT BY SHELBY  COUNTY, ALABAMA. THEY ARGUE THAT THE LAW IS  UNFAIR, BECAUSE IT APPLIES ONLY  TO STATES WITH HISTORIES OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION:  ALABAMA, ARIZONA, GEORGIA,  LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI, SOUTH CAROLINA, TEXAS, PARTS OF  CAROLINA, TEXAS, VIRGINIA, AND  ALASKA, WHICH HAS A SAD HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ITS  AFRICAN AMERICAN  POPULATION BRIAN. [LAUGHTER] GOOD GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S A GOOD GUY. [LAUGHTER] BUT THERE'S ONE KEY REASON TO  STRIKE THIS ACT DOWN, AS SHELBY  -- THERE'S ONE REASON TO GET RID OF THIS LAW AS SHELBY  COUNTY LAWYER BERT REIN  EXPLAINED TO THE COURT.
THE PROBLEM TO WHICH THE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS ADDRESSED  IS SOLVED.
Stephen: YOU HEARD IT, FOLKS:  RACISM IS SOLVED! JIMMY, DROP THE FULLY INTEGRATED  BALLOONS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE OVERCAME IT! WHOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK AT THAT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK AT THAT! LOOK AT THAT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOW, I MUST HAVE MISSED THE  MOMENT WHEN RACISM ENDED. I WONDER WHEN IT WAS? THE TIME ROSS DATED AISHA TYLER  ON "FRIENDS"? [LAUGHTER] OR WHEN KEEBLER ADDED A BLACK  ELF? [LAUGHTER] OH, I KNOW, IT MUST HAVE BEEN  WHEN THEY MADE SLAVERY ILLEGAL  IN MISSISSIPPI ALL THE WAY BACK IN FOUR WEEKS AGO. [LAUGHTER] [  APPLAUSE  ] IN FACT, WE'RE LIVING IN SUCH A  POST-RACIAL UTOPIA THAT WE  COULDN'T SUPPRESS BLACK VOTES EVEN IF WE WANTED TO! WHICH WE DEFINITELY DON'T. [LAUGHTER] LUCKILY CONSERVATIVE STALWART  AND JUSTICE-THE-HUTT ANTONIN  SCALIA KNOWS THAT THE COURTS HAVE TO DECIDE THIS, BECAUSE  EVEN THOUGH RACISM IS OVER,  AMERICA'S ELECTED  REPRESENTATIVES LACK THE BICAMERAL BALL SACK TO VOTE  AGAINST THIS THING.
I AM FAIRLY CONFIDENT IT WILL  BE REENACTED IN PERPETUITY  UNLESS-- UNLESS A COURT CAN SAY IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH THE  CONSTITUTION. IT'S-- IT'S A CONCERN THAT THIS  IS NOT THE KIND OF A QUESTION  YOU CAN LEAVE TO CONGRESS. EVEN THE NAME OF IT IS  WONDERFUL: THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT. WHO IS GOING TO VOTE AGAINST  THAT IN THE FUTURE?
Stephen: YES, YOU'D HAVE TO  BE AN A-HOLE TO VOTE AGAINST  THAT IN THE FUTURE! LUCKILY, WE'VE GOT AN A-HOLE WHO  WILL VOTE AGAINST IT IN  THE PRESENT. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS, THE VOTING RIGHTS [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS  OBSOLETE  IT'S LIKE AN OLD RESTRAINING  ORDER. THESE STATES ARE JUST SAYING,  "YES, I USED TO BEAT MY  GIRLFRIEND, BUT I HAVEN'T SINCE THE RESTRAINING ORDER. SO WE DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE!" [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE TO CELEBRATE THIS MILESTONE  IN EQUALITY LIVE VIA SATELITE IS  ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING  COMMITTEE, CHAIRMAN EMERITUS OF  THE NAACP AND CIVIL RIGHTS PIONEER JULIAN BOND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
Stephen: NOW THAT RACIAL  DISCRIMINATION IS OVER WHAT DO  YOU PLAN ON DOING WITH YOUR FREE  TIME? TAKE POTTERY CLASSES, HOT YOGA?
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT RACIAL  DISCRIMINATION IS OVER. IN FACT, IF ANYTHING IT'S  INCREASED DURING THE PERIOD WHEN  BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN PRESIDENT.
Stephen: SORRY, EXCUSE ME,  SIR, WHEN THE BLACK PRESIDENT  WAS PRESIDENT RACISM GOT WORSE? THAT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY  SENSE.
YES, DID IT.
Stephen: HOW IS THAT  POSSIBLE HE IS BLACK.
EXACTLY SO AND HIS PRESENCE  ANGERED PEOPLE WHO ACCUSED ACCUSED ACCUS  HIM OF BEING PRESIDENT WHILE  BLACK.
Stephen: HE IS GUILTY OF  BEING PRESIDENT WHILE BLACK, YOU  ADMIT THAT?
YES, HE IS. LUCKILY THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE  WHO DON'T LIKE IT ARE SMALL BUT  THE FACT THAT THEY EXIST IS  UPSETTING.
Stephen: NOW THAT THE  SUPREME COURT IT'S PEOPLE IN  BLACK ROBES IT'S PEOPLE IN  PROGRESS.
IT'S STEP -- IT'S NOT A STEP  FORWARD BUT YOU KNOW, I AM SURE  YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY JUSTICE  SCALIA. HE IS THE RUSH LIMBAUGH OF THE  SUPREME COURT. SAYS INAPPROPRIATE THINGS OVER  AND OVER AGAIN MOST RECENTLY  ABOUT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
Stephen: YES, IT'S NOT A  NECESSITY A RACIAL ENTITLEMENT.
IT'S NOT AN ENTITLEMENT TO BE  ABLE TO VOTE WITHOUT  DISCRIMINATION. IT'S SOMETHING ALL AMERICANS  EXPECT TO HAVE.
Stephen: CAN WE EVEN  REMEMBER WHO WAS DENYING VOTING  RIGHTS TO WHOM?
OF COURSE WE CAN. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER.
Stephen: I CAN'T.
YOU LIVED IN SOUTH CAROLINA. SOUTH CAROLINA WAS A MAJOR  OFFENDER AND SO A CERTAIN  DEGREE, MUCH LESS SO NOW, SOUTH CAROLINA IS AN OFFENDER NOW.
Stephen: I DON'T REMEMBER  BEING DISCRIMINATED IN SOUTH  CAROLINA.
THE POINT IS THAT YOU WERE  NOT DISCRIMINATED IN SOUTH  CAROLINA.
Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR  APOLL BY.
BLACK PEOPLE IN S.C. WERE  DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
Stephen: WHAT IS WRONG WITH  A LITTLE VOTER INTIMIDATION? DOESN'T IT MAKE THE VOTER  HUNGRIER WITH THE RIGHT TO VOTE? IT'S LIKE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS  PLAYING HARD TO GET. IT'S EXCITING. IT'S A POLL TEASE.
ODDLY ENOUGH THE ATTEMPTS BY  REPUBLICANS TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT  FOR RACIAL ARE NOTES TO VOTE IN THE LAST ELECTION SPURRED MORE  TO THE POLLS THAN WERE EXPECTED  TO GOOD THERE.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT GEORGIA  ROOTS, CLARENCE THOMAS HAS  GEORGIA ROOTS. HOW COME YOU SEE IT SO  DIFFERENTLY?
JUSTICE THOMAS AND I HAVE  LIVED DIFFERENT LIVES AND DRAWN  DIFFERENT LESSONS FROM THE LIVES WE'VE LIVED. HE THINKS THIS WAY AND I THINK  THAT WAY AND I'M RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU ARE RIGHT. OKAY. ONCE IT'S NOT HAPPENING ANYMORE  SHOULDN'T YOU LET THE LAW GO? FOR INSTANCE, WE DON'T HAVE  SLAVERY ANYMORE. SHOULDN'T WE GET RID OF THE  13th AMENDMENT. DOESN'T SEEM NECESSARY. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M GLAD IT'S THERE.
Stephen: OKAY.
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE  AFFECTED ME FIT WEREN'T.
Stephen: THAT'S ASSUMING  THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO  ENSLAVE AFRICAN-AMERICANS AGAIN AND IT'S A LITTLE PREJUDICIAL.
THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE EAGER  TO DO SO. LUCKILY THEIR NUMBERS ARE NOT  GREAT AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO  HAVE MUCH POWER.
Stephen: WE'RE NOT GOING TO  ENSLAVE AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SIR,  WE HAVE MEXICAN NOWS.
INDEED. I'M GLAD THE MEXICANS ARE GLAD  TO HEAR THAT.
Stephen: MR. BOND THANK YOU  FOR JOINING ME.
