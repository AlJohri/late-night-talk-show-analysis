NICE TO BE HERE.
Stephen: CAN I CALL YOU  JON.
YOU CAN CALL ME JON. ALL RIGHT CALL ME MR. COLBERT.
Stephen: YOU WERE OUTGOING  WRITER OF SPEECHES FOR PRESIDENT  OBAMA. YOU WORKED FOR HIM AS A SENATOR  AND CANDIDATE.
YES.
Stephen: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
31.
Stephen: YOU ARE 31 SO YOU  WERE WORKING FOR HIM WHEN YOU  WERE 23.
23.
Stephen: AND YOUR PREVIOUS  JOB BEFORE THIS WAS -- PLEASE  USE THE WORDS FRY STATION,  PLEASE.
I WAS A SPEECHWRITER FOR JOHN  KERRY IN HIS 2004 CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: OBAMA STOLE YOU.
HE DIDN'T STEAL ME. THE CAMPAIGN ENDED IN 2004. JOHN KERRY DID NOT WIN.
Stephen: WHAT?
SPOILER ALERT.
Stephen: THEN YOU STARTED  WORKING FOR THE PRESIDENT?
I DID.
Stephen: WERE YOU INVOLVED  IN THE 2004 SPEECH HE DID AT�r THE  CONVENTION?
HE WROTE THAT HIMSELF.A6kDfY     ephen: WO,i�   r YOU WROTE A LOT OF HIS SPEECHES  AFTER THAT.
I DID.
Stephen: THAT'S KIND OF  HEART BREAKING BECAUSE NOT ONLY  DOES THE GUY USE A PROMPTER HE IS NOT WRITING THE WORDS IN THE  PROMPTER. PLEASE, PLEASE TELL ME HE AT  LEAST FLIES AIR FORCE ONE.
HE DOES NOT. BUT HE WRITES A LOT OF HIS OWN  SPEECHES. WE WORKED TOGETHER. IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS.
Stephen: KIND OF, GUYS LIKE  YOU, YOU AND THE PRESIDENT SAME  LEVEL. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, WHAT IS THE PROCESS LIKE? DO YOU SAY MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE  THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD BE GO  TO SAY OR DOES HE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING TEACHERSERS ARE  GOOD AND HOPE IS GOOD AND LET'S  MAKE THINGS BETTER, SOCIALIZE MEDICINE PUT SOME LIPSTICK ON  THE PIG. WHAT IS THE PROCESS?
SIT DOWN WITH HIM HE SPEAKS  WHAT IS ON HIS MIND FOR 20, 30  MINUTES I TYPE EVERYTHING HE  SAYS. AFTER WE'RE DONE MEETING I GO  BACK AND WRITE A DRAFT WITH MY  TEAM, OTHER SPEECHWRITERS. WE TALK TO THE DIFFERENT POLICY  FOLKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE,  EVERYONE WHO HAS A STAKE ON THE  SPEECH.
Stephen: EVERYBODY GETS  THERE TWO CENTS. DO THEY SAY THAT'S MY TURF DON'T  DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY?
YOU GET A LITTLE OF THAT. EVERYONE WE WORK WITH IS  WONDERFUL.
Stephen: SURE. OF COURSE. EVERY PLACE ANYONE WORKS IS  FANTASTIC. YOU ARE FREE NOW, YOU ARE GONE,  YOU ARE DONE.
I HAVE ONE MORE DAY.
Stephen: (bleep) I BOOKED  YOU 24 HOURS TOO EARLY BECAUSE  BABY IT'S TIME TO DISH. YOU ARE A YOUNG GUY, WHY DOESN'T  THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECHES HAVE  MORE YOUNG LANGUAGE LIKE OBAMA CARE IS AWESOME SAUCE.
I TRY KEEP THIS OUT. THE PRESIDENT HAS A GOOD FEEL  FOR WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY ON ANY  GIVEN SPEECH. WE'RE THERE TO HELP HIM GET IT  DOWN ON PAPER. HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WRITING  IT HIM IS. WE'LL GO BACK AND FORTH. HE WILL TAKE YELLOW LEGAL PADS  AND SIT THERE AND WRITE LONGHAND  UNTIL 2:00 OR 3:00 IN THE MORNING AND SEND US BACK SIX OR  SEVEN PAGES.
Stephen: ANYTHING YOU WROTE  BROKE YOUR HEART THAT DIDN'T  MAKE IT IN?
THERE'S LINES THAT YOU THINK  O YOU KNOW. WHEN HE SENDS YOU BACK EDITS HE  WRITES IN THE BEST PART OF THE  SPEECH, THE MOST AUTHENTIC SPEECH AND THAT GETS IT.
Stephen: I DON'T ALWAYS  AGREE PER SE. BUT HIS SPEECHES ARE OFTEN VERY  LONG AND MORE WORDS IS ALWAYS  BETTER.
ALWAYS.
Stephen: THERE'S NOT LIKE  LITTLE PHRASES, CATCH PHRASES  LIKE ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY, OR NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR  ITSELF OR WHERE IS THE BEEF? YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE IS HISS WHERE THE BEEF? IS THERE -- WHERE IS HIS WHERE'S  THE BEEF? IS THERE A PHRASE?
IN HIS 2004 CONVENTION SPEECH  WHICH WAS THE SPEECH THAT  LAUNCHED HIS NATIONAL CAREER. WHY I LIKED IT SO MUCH AND WE  TALKED ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE IT  TOLD A STORY FROM BEGINNING TO END AND TOLD A STORY ABOUT HIS  LIFE AND HOW IT FIT INTO THE  LARGER AMERICAN STORY AND HOW THERE ARE VALUES WE ALL SHARE. WHEN WE SIT DOWN WITH A SPEECH,  WE DON'T -- WE THINK LESS ABOUT  THE LINES OR WHAT IS QUOTED AND WHAT WE MAKE SURE MOST OF SAUL  WE'RE TELLING A STORY FROM  BEGINNING TO END AND THAT THERE'S A LOGICAL ARGUMENT IN  THE SPEECH. THAT'S HOW HE SPEAKS AND THINKS. WE TRY TO REFLECT THAT.
Stephen: THE RACE SPEECH  FROM PHILADELPHIA DURING THE  CAMPAIGN OF 2008. I CALLED A FRIEND AFTER I HEARD  THAT SPEECH AND I SAID, YOU  KNOW, THE THING THAT I LIKED ABOUT THAT IS THAT I FELT LIKE  UNLIKE A LOT OF POLITICIANS I  THINK I ACTUALLY HEARD THAT GUY  TALKING. I FELT LIKE I WAS HEARING THAT  MAN SPEAK AND NOT HIS  SPEECHWRITERS. WAS I ACTUALLY HEARING YOU  SPEAK? ANY CHANCE YOU ARE THE FIRST  BLACK PRESIDENT?
THERE'S NO CHANCE. I WILL TELL YOU SORTIE OF THAT  THAT -- STORY OF THAT SPEECH. HE CALLED ME AFTER A LONG DAY AT  NIGHT TWO DAYS BEFORE HE WAS  SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU THE SPEECH. HE SAID I'M GOING TO GIVE THE  THOUGHTS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. DO A DRAFT TOMORROW AND WE'LL  WORK ON IT TO THERE. HE SPOKE TO ME FOR 45 MINUTES  AND KNEW EXACTLY EXACTLY WHEN HE  WANTED TO SAY. THE STUFF THAT I CONTRIBUTED WAS  STUFF THAT YOU COULD HEAR ALMOST  ANYONE SAY.
Stephen: LIKE CONJUNCTIONS.
LIKE CONGRESS JUNCTIONS.
Stephen: THANK YOU JOINING
