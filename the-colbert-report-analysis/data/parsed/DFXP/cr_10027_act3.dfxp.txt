I KNOW.
Stephen:  ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? ARE YOU READY? ALL RIGHT? HOW COME YOU HAVE POLITICS IN YOUR MUSIC? OKAY? IT'S DANCE MUSIC. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST LET ME GET UP THERE AND SHAKE IT. DO I HAVE TO-- LIKE DO YOU HAVE TO DANCE AND THINK ABOUT, LIKE, THE BOAT MASSACRE OF 1985? ( LAUGHTER ).
YES!
Stephen:  WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SING ABOUT LOVELY LADY LUMPS OR, LIKE, OR LIKE BUBBLE YUM BUM.
SOMEBODY HAD ALREADY WRITTEN THAT SONG.
Stephen:  WHY DO POLITICS?
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS INSPIRED BY A LOT OF AMERICAN ARTISTS.
Stephen:  WHO?
BOB DYLAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YOU KNOW, PUBLIC ENEMY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YOU KNOW, I PUT OUT MY FIRST SONG AND CAME TO AMERICA, I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE USED TO IT ALREADY. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS SO SHOCKING.
Stephen:  AS AN ARTIST BORN IN ENGLAND, GREW UP IN SRI LANKA, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF AMERICA? YOU'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME.
YES.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU, OF US? WATCH YOUR ANSWER.
WHOA! THIS IS-- I THINK.

Stephen:  I'LL START, GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I THINK AMERICA-- I'M GOING TO BE REALLY CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE THAT'S A CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION.
Stephen:  "WHAT DO I THINK OF AMERICA?"
YES.
Stephen:  STAND UP AND SALUTE, BABY, AND YOU'RE DONE.
WELL, YOU KNOW --
Stephen:  I CAN TAKE IT.
IN MY MIND THERE ARE NO COUNTRIES. LIKE WE'RE ALL ONE. WE ALL LIVE ON THIS PLANET.
Stephen:  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME?
I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS-- I'VE NEVER WATCHED THE SHOW.
OH!
SORRY, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T WATCH TELEVISION. I DON'T WATCH TELEVISION AS A WHOLE. IT'S NOT THAT I WAS SINGLING YOU OUT.
Stephen:  THAT'S OKAY. IT DOESN'T MATTER. ( LAUGHTER )

Stephen:  WHAT?
