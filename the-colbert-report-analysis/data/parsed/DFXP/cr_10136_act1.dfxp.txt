(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! NATION -- (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") NATION -- (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH! NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LOVE AND ADULATION TONIGHT. I NEED IT MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE NEWS, YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A TOUGH WEEK FOR, LET'S SAY HUMANS. (LAUGHTER) FROM BATTLES IN GAZA TO RUSSIA SHELLING UKRAINE TO TALIBAN ADVANCES IN AFGHANISTAN, THEY'RE NOT RELEASING ANY MORE NEW WEIRD AL VIDEOS. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, WE ARE FACING A SITUATION I'VE ALWAYS FEARED -- THINGS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AS BAD AS WE MAKE THEM SOUND ON CABLE NEWS. (LAUGHTER)
THE WORLD ON FIRE. FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO UKRAINE TO LIBYA.
THE WORLD IS ON FIRE. RUSSIA ROCKETING UKRAINE. ADD ISRAEL AND GAZA. ILLEGALS FLOODING OUR BORDER.
THE WORLD IS A MESS RIGHT NOW.
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
THE WORLD IS BURNING.
TO PUT IT MILDLY, THE WORLD IS A MESS.
STEPHEN: MADELINE ALBRIGHT, WHOSE FAMILY WAS FORCED INTO EXILE BY THE GERMAN INVASION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1938, SAYS THE WORLD IS A MESS. (LAUGHTER) AND FOR HER, NAZI EXILE IS A FOND CHILDHOOD MEMORY. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I DON'T ENJOY COVERING THIS KIND OF HEART WRENCHING NEWS, AND NEITHER DOES MY NETWORK. MOUNTING DEATH TOLLS DO NOT MOVE A LOT OF JACK LINK'S JERKY. (LAUGHTER) THEY'RE JUST GOOD PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL SOME QUALITY SASQUATCH MEAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S MY DUTY AS A NEWSMAN TO GRIT MY TEETH AND BRING YOU THE MAJOR STORIES, NO MATTER HOW HARD IT MAY BE TO SAY IT. VERY HARD TO SAY IT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND WITH THAT IN MIND, I BRING YOU MY NEW SEGMENT:  I NEED A DRINK. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. (APPLAUSE) JIMMY, I'M NOW READY FOR THE BIG STORY.
INTENSIVE ATTACKS IN THE PAST 24 HOURS.
MORE EXPLOSIONS IN GAZA.
TWO DEADLY BLASTS MONDAY.  THE FIRST KILLING TEN PEOPLE, MOSTLY CHILDREN PLAYING ON THIS BUSY STREET.
DEATH SPREAD ALL AROUND.
STEPHEN: OKAY. THIS BEER JUST GOT OUTGUNNED. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS. ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS. WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE IS THE VIOLENT CONSEQUENCE OF DECADES OF VICTIMIZATION AND UNPROVOKED AGGRESSION. I THINK YOU KNOW WHICH SIDE I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT'S THE -- (MUFFLED SPEECH INTO THE GLASS) OKAY. I'M ONE FOR ONE. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT IN THE OLD NEWS HOPPER?
A TROUBLING ESCALATION IN FIGHTING IN UKRAINE.
RUSSIA IS DIRECTLY, DIRECTLY ATTACKING UKRAINE WITH DEADLY FORCE.
FIERCE FIGHTING NEAR THE WRECKAGE OF MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 17.
STEPHEN: AH-HAAAA, THEY'RE FIGHTING NEAR THE SITE OF LAST WEEK'S PLANE CRASH WHICH I HAD ALMOST MANAGED TO FORGET ABOUT OKAY! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TELL YOU WHAT, NEXT WEEK, SYRIA MAYBE YOU COULD STOP BY WITH YOUR NERVE GAS AND TURN THIS HORROR DOUBLE-HEADER INTO AN ATROCITY-DUCKEN! COME ON, NEWS! THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?!
TALIBAN GUNMEN STOPPED THREE MINI BUSES FRIDAY AND SIMPLY SHOT 14 PASSENGERS TO DEATH.
STEPHEN: OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET'S MOVE ON FROM THE INTERNATIONAL STORIES. HOW ABOUT SOME SCIENCE STORIES? THEY CURE ANY BIG DISEASES LATELY?
THIS IS THE LARGEST EBOLA OUTBREAK WE'VE EVER SEEN IN HISTORY. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (EMPTYING DRINK WITH STRAW)
STEPHEN: EBOLA, HUH? GOOD THING I STOCKED UP ON THE BROWN PURELL. (LAUGHTER) SO TO RECAP, EVERYTHING IS THE WORST, AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE SAD FOREVER. AT LEAST WE HAVE HOLLYWOOD TO DISTRACT US. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD CHEER ME UP? THE COMEDIC STYLINGS OF A BRASSY AND LOVEABLE DAME WHO HAS SEEN THE WORST AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH A SONG IN HER HEART AND SMILE ON HER FACE.
FAMED HOLLYWOOD AND BROADWAY STAR ELAINE STRITCH HAS DIED.
STEPHEN: (BLEEP) THAT. OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S GO TO THE HARD STUFF. THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: THIS ALCOHOL IS ISO-PROPRIATE. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THAT CONCLUDES "STEPHEN COLBERT'S I NEED A DRINK," WHICH FOR THE RECORD DID NOT WORK. EITHER THIS BOOZE IS BROKEN, OR THE NEWS IS TOO SOBERING. OKAY. SHAKE IT OFF, COLBERT. YOU'RE A PRO. MOVE ON. MOVE ON. THAT'S ENOUGH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. LET'S TURN TO SOMETHING THAT EVIDENTLY WILL NEVER DIE AND CANNOT BE DESTROYED. SARAH PALIN. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF SARAH PALIN. SHE'S A STRONG LEADER WITH A PROVEN HISTORY OF SELFLESSNESS. IN THE MIDST OF HER 2008 CAMPAIGN, SHE TOOK TIME TO HELP OUT A STRUGGLING SENIOR WITH SEVERELY IMPAIRED JUDGMENT. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS WEEK, IN HER CONTINUING QUEST TO REMIND AMERICA OF HER EXISTENCE, PALIN ANNOUNCED A NEW PROJECT.
HELLO AND WELCOME TO A NEW PROJECT. THIS IS A NEWS CHANNEL THAT REALLY IS A LOT MORE THAN NEWS. ARE YOU TIRED OF THE MEDIA FILTERS? WELL, I AM. I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, SO WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS EASY TOO. YOU CAN WATCH OUR CHANNEL RIGHT HERE ON YOUR COMPUTER, TABLET OR EVEN ON YOUR SMARTPHONE. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON'T TALK ABOUT AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE IDEAS THAT -- MMM -- I THINK WASHINGTON DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HEAR.
STEPHEN: YES, THE ALL SARAH PALIN CHANNEL! IT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S ALWAYS DONE, ONLY -- MMM -- NOTHING ELSE. (LAUGHTER) 'CUZ, FOLKS, IT'S 24-7 PALIN-TAINMENT STREAMED RIGHT TO YOUR PHONE, WITH THE HELP OF "TAPP," WHICH IT TURNS OUT IS A MEDIA COMPANY AND NOT, AS I FIRST ASSUMED, THE NAME OF ONE OF HER CHILDREN. (LAUGHTER) AND LIKE THE WOMAN HERSELF, THE SARAH PALIN CHANNEL IS ALL ABOUT SARAH PALIN.
WE'LL ALSO SHARE SOME OF THE FUN THAT GOES ON IN THE PALIN HOUSEHOLD AND A LOT OF OUR ADVENTURES IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS TRYING TO JUST GET US FROM POINT A TO POINT B AND, BELIEVE ME, IT IS FUN BECAUSE IT'S REAL LIFE.
STEPHEN: YEAH, IT'S FUN BECAUSE IT'S REAL LIFE. THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS TIV0 THAT EXCITING STARING CONTEST ON THE MIRROR CHANNEL. (LAUGHTER) THAT SHOW IS AMAZING -- HOW IS IT "ALWAYS" A TIE?! HE'S GOOD. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS ALL PART OF SARAH'S CONTINUING MISSION TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS AT ANY COST. SPECIFICALLY, "$9.95 A MONTH." (LAUGHTER) SURE, THAT'S MORE THAN NETFLIX. BUT IT'S JUST AS GOOD AS HOUSE OF CARDS -- WITH EVEN MORE THREATENING MONOLOGUES INTO CAMERA. (LAUGHTER) THIS CHANNEL OFFERS YOU SOMETHING MORE, BY OFFERING YOU LESS. AS THE SITE NOTES, WE FEEL THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD FEEL MORE SECURE KNOWING EVERYONE WATCHING, UPLOADING VIDEOS AND PARTICIPATING IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND VIDEO CHATS WAS A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER." THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S A SAFE SPACE WHERE LIKE-MINDED FOLKS CAN HEAR THINGS THEY ALREADY AGREE WITH FROM SOMEONE WHOSE OPINION THEY ALREADY KNOW. A PLACE WHERE WE PALIN-HEADS CAN GATHER AND ASK THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. AMONG THE MOST POPULAR, APPARENTLY, IS "WHAT IS YOUR CANCELLATION POLICY?" (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WE PALIN FANS WANT TO BE JUST LIKE HER AND QUIT HALFWAY THROUGH OUR COMMITMENT. (LAUGHTER) BUT IF $9.95 SOUNDS TOO RICH RICH FOR YOUR BLOOD, SIGN UP FOR MY NEW PREMIUM WEB CHANNEL -- "STEPHEN COLBERT'S ANGRY ECHO CHAMBER ." FOR JUST $9.94, IT'S A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU, IF YOU HAVE A VALID CREDIT CARD. WE'LL DISCUSS THE WASHINGTON ISSUES OF THE DAY -- AND THE ISSUES OF THE NIGHT, LIKE WHERE DID THE SUN GO? (LAUGHTER) PLUS, "STEPHEN COLBERT'S ANGRY ECHO CHAMBER" GIVES YOU 24-7 ACCESS TO EVERYTHING I DO. LIKE FOOTAGE OF ME MAKING AND EATING A B.L.T. (LAUGHTER) IS THAT WHAT I SPENT YOUR TEN BUCKS ON? THE ANSWER MIGHT SURPRISE YOU. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU MIGHT EVEN SEE YOUR NAME ON MY CHANNEL WHEN I DEPOSIT YOUR CHECKS IN AN A.T.M.! (LAUGHTER) AND SARAH PALIN'S CHANNEL ONLY TAKES YOU FROM POINT A TO POINT B -- BUT YOU CAN FOLLOW ME ALL THE WAY TO POINT C, POINT D, THEN BACK TO POINT B WHEN I REALIZE I LEFT MY SUNGLASSES THERE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S REAL-LIFE FUN! AND REMEMBER, SARAH PALIN'S CHANNEL IS SARAPALINCHANNEL.COM, NOT THESARAHPALINCHANNEL.COM. WE BOUGHT THAT ONE TODAY. (CHEERING) AND IT'S FREE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
