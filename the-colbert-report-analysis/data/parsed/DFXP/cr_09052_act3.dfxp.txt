[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST IS THE AUTHOR OF THE  SHORT STORY COLLECTION "TENTH OF  DECEMBER."  IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY NOVELIZED THE CALENDAR. PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE SAUNDERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GEORGE, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
GOOD TO BE HERE STEENCHT IT'S  BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE YOU WERE  HERE.
TOO LONG.
TOO LONG.
Stephen: FOR THE PEOPLE WHO  DON'T KNOW, THE FEW PEOPLE WHO  DON'T KNOW YOU ARE A MACARTHUR GRANT FELLOW AUTHOR OF SEVERAL  COLLECTIONS OF SHORT STORIES. YOU'VE GOT A NEW SCHEKS CALLED  "THE TENTH OF DECEMBER."  THIS  IS THE THING. THIS IS SHORT STORIES. IN THE NORKTS MAGAZINE CALLED IT  "THE BEST BOOK YOU'LL READ THIS  YEAR."  OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DO YOU WRITE SHORT STORIES? AMERICA LIKES BIG, GO BIG OR GO  HOME. WE LIKE BIG, HUGE, HUGE NOVELS.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY, THE WE'RE  GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.
Stephen: CAN YOU IMAGINE  THIS. SAY YOU WERE MADLY IN LOVE WITH  SOMEBODY AND YOUR MISSION WAS TO  TELL THE PERSON THAT YOU LOVE  THEM. HERE IS TWO SCENARIOS. ONE IS YOU CAN TAKE A WEEK LONG  TRAIN TRIP WITH THE PERSON, TAKE  YOUR TIME. YOU'LL BE IN SITUATIONS,  BEAUTIFUL SCENERY. THAT'S A NOVEL AND THE SECOND  SCENARIO IS --
Stephen: SOUNDS REALLY  GOOD.
THE SECOND SCENARIO YOU IS  STEP ON THE TRAIN AND YOU HAVE  THREE MINUTES. SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE ALL THAT  DECORATION IN THREE MINUTES. THAT WOULD BE A SHORT STORY.
Stephen: CAN I GET ON THE  TRAIN WITH HER?
NO.
Stephen: WHY CAN'T I GET ON  THE TRAIN?
BECAUSE IT'S A SHORT STORY  YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED. YOU HAVE TO END IT IN EIGHT  PAGES AND GET OUT.
Stephen: IT'S A SHORT STORY  I WANT TO READ. WHERE IS SHE GOING? WHY CAN'T GO I WITH HER. DOES SHE LOVE ME BACK? I HAVE TO KNOW.
SOMETIMES THE SHORT STORIES  ENDS WITH THAT QUESTION, DOES  SHE LOVE ME BACK? THAT'S IT.
Stephen: WHY PAY FOR A  BOOK? I WANT SOME WEIGHT BEHIND THE  THING. I'M SURE IT'S VERY GOOD BUT I  LIKE TO PAY BY THE POUND. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHY I LOVE AYN RAND. IT'S JUST TWO COVERS AND SHE  SHOVELS WORDS IN BETWEEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE THING WITH THE STORY IS  IT'S KIND OF GENETICALLY RELATED  TO A JOKE IN THAT IF I SAY, A DUCK WALKED INTO A BAR THEN IT'S  KIND OF A THROWDOWN. EVERYBODY KNOWS IN THREE MINUTES  I'M EITHER GOING TO BE LAUGHING  OR THERE'S AN AWKWARD SILENCE. HERE IN THIS STORY HERE IS EIGHT  PAGES OF A STORY AND WHEN YOU  GET TO THE END IT'S EITHER EH OR THE PERSON IS CRYING.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND  COMPLETELY.
ABDUCTED ON THE TRAIN.
Stephen: SO SHORTER IS  SOMETIMES BETTER.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY. AND IT'S LIKE A JOKE.
BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF LIKE  THIS IN LIFE THE CLOCK IS  TICKING. YOU SEE A FRIEND, YOU WANT TO  SAY SOMETHING. YOU WANT TO GIVE ADVICE, YOU  WANT TO TELL THEM YOU CARE ABOUT  THEM BUT IN REAL LIFE TIME GOES  FAST. THE READER FEELS SHE'S WITH YOU. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. YOU ARE TRYING DESPERATELY TO  SAY SOMETHING IMPORTANT IT'SES  NOT EASY YOU COULD BLOW IT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A POP SONG.
Stephen: IS IT A IS JOKE OR  POP SONG?
IT'S BOTH. IT'S A POP SONG WITH A JOKE.
Stephen: KNOCK, KNOCK. >>S WHO THERE?
Stephen: SHORT STORY.
SHORT STORY WHO?
Stephen: SORRY, POP SONG. [ LAUGHTER ]
FAIR ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: HERE IS ANOTHER  THING. DO YOU EVER THINK, DON'T GET ME  WRONG, I LIKE YOUR STUFF. I READ ONE OF THESE. [ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY? THANK YOU.
Stephen: I READ ONE. MY FAVORITE ONE. NOT QUITE TWO PAGES LONG. WHY NOT A HAIKU? WHY NOT ENCIEWD IT IN DNA AND  INJECT IT INTO MY MIND? TAKE A SHORT STORY AND CARVE IT  ON THE HEAD OF A BULLET? WHY NOT THAT? LOOK FOR THAT IMPACT. I LOVE YOU DON'T GET ON THE  TRAIN. BAM!
IT COULD WORK. IT COULD WORK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT COULD WORK. HEMINGWAY STORY.
Stephen: HE TOLD HIS OWN  STORY.
DID HE INDEED. HE HAS A SIX WORD STORY. IT'S DEPRESSING. SAYS THIS FOR IS SALE, BABY  SHOES, NEVER WORN. I KNOW BUT YOU COULD MAKE IT  HAPPIER. FOR SALE, BABY SHOES WORN OUT.
Stephen: BECAUSE KEPT THEM  ON THE BABY TOO LONG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: I'VE HEARD  INFORMATION IS KINGIZE  QUEENEDDIZED. YOU WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING. WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING. WHY DOES SHE LOVE HIM SO MANY  SNL THEY WERE EVERYTHING FOR  EACH OTHER. WHAT COUNTRY ARE THE KING AND  QUEEN ON? WHERE THEY REALLY IS KING AND  QUEEN OR JUST IN EACH OTHER'S  EYES.
YOU HAVE A NOVELIST THOUGHT  FOR SURE.
Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING I  DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT SNUP.
NO, NO.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  COMING BACK. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE STORIES. GEORGE SAUNDERS "THE TENTH OF
