( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  ...INTO THE PAST. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. WELCOME, EVERYBODY. NOW, I'M READY FOR THE  DISCUSSION, AND I HOPE ARE YOU,  TOO, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO DIVE IN DEEP, GOOD FOR THE REAL  EGGHEAD STUFF. I WILL BE ANALYZINGS METAPHORS  AND SIMILES LIKE THEY WERE  CANDY. LAUGH AND DISCUSSING  FORESHADOWING AS IF MY LIFE  DEPENDED ON IT. ( LAUGHTER )  WHICH IT MAY. ( LAUGHTER )  AND HERE TO HELP ME  SMAR-TIFICATE IS THE  PULEETSER-PRIZE WINNING  OCTOBEROR OF "A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD" JENNIFER EGAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME TO THE C-OH-LBERT BOOK  CLUB. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen:  COULD I GET A  LITTLE CHARDONNAY?
WHY NOT.
Stephen:  JENNIFER, WHY DO  YOU THINK "THE GREAT GATSBY"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. WHY WOULD YOU SAY "THE GREAT  GATSBY" IS THE GREAT AMERICAN  NOVEL? WHAT DO YOU SAY TO US?
I THINK IT CAPTURES SOMETHING  ABOUT THE AMERICAN PSYCHE THAT  MOST OF US WOULD RECOGNIZE, WHICH IS A WILLINGNESS TO START  OVER, REINVENT OURSELVES,  IMAGINE A NEW LIFE, AND IN A WAY, THAT DREAM IS A LOT OF WHAT  BUILT THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen:  WHO WOULDN'T WANT  TO BE GATSBY, YOU KNOW?
EXACTLY.
Stephen:  HE'S GOT IT ALL. HE'S RICH. HE'S FACE IN HIS OWN WAY. HE'S GOT A HUGE HOUSE, AND  EVERYTHING WORKS OUT FOR HIM  UNTIL IT DOES NOT. ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, OF COURSE HE STARTS AS  SOMEONE ELSE AND HE CREATES ALL  OF THAT AS A WAY OF TRYING TO THE LOVE OF A WOMAN HE COULD NOT  WIN WHEN HE WAS JUST A POOR  NOBODY. THERE'S NO QUESTION IT DOESN'T  WORK POWER PLANT HE DOESN'T GET  THE GIRL AND HE GETS KILLED.
Stephen:  WOULD IT HELP IF  HE HAD HAD A BIGGER HOUSE? ( LAUGHTER )  HERE'S WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HIM--  IS THAT HE REACHED FOR WHAT HE  WANTED. AND DIDN'T LET ANYTHING GET IN  HIS WAY. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE GREEN  LIGHT. WHAT-- WHAT IS THE YEAN LIGHT  THAT HE'S REACHING FOR?
WELL, THE GREEN LIGHT TO HIM  SYMBOLIZES DAISY BECAUSE IT'S  THE END OF HER PIER, AND HE HAS BOUGHT A HOUSE DIRECTLY ACROSS  FROM THE PIER SO HE COULD LOOK  AT IT AND THINK ABOUT HER.
Stephen:  IS THAT A  METAPHOR, ALLEGORY? WHAT IS THAT? STAY SYMBOL?
IT'S A VERY OVERT SYMBOL. Q. OVERT SYMBOL.OF IS THERE.
IT'S A SYMBOL CALLED A SYMBOL  OF DAISY HERSELF. THE INTERESTING THING IS WHEN HE  ACTUALLY FINALLY IS IN HER  PRESENCE AGAIN AND TELLS HER HE'S BEEN WATCHING THE GREEN  LIGHT AND THINKING OF HER, NICK,  THE NARRATOR, PERCEIVED A LITTLE DISAPPOINT INDEPENDENT IN GATSBY  BECAUSE SUDDENLY THE GREEN LIGHT  DOESN'T MOEB ANYTHING ANY MORE. SHE'S RIGHT THERE AND FITZGERALD  WRITES HIS COUNT OF ENCHANTED  OBJECTS HAD DIMINISHED BY ONE. IN A WAY, THE FANTASY ITSELF IS  THE THING.
Stephen:  HE THREW PARTIES  TO IMPRESS HER, AND GOT RICH TO  IMPRESS HER AND GOT THE HOUSE TO IMPRESS HER AND HE TELLS HER HIS  DREAM OF HER AND WHAT THE LIGHT  REPRESENTS AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY IMPRESS HER. AND LATER, SHE LEAVE HERSELF  HUSBAND FOR HIM, AND THEN SHE  HITS SOMEBODY WITH A CAR THAT GATSBY, AND KILLS THE PERSON,  AND GATSBY COVERS FOR HER. AND SHE STILL GOES BACK TO TOM  BUCHANAN, WHO IS A RACIST WHO  BEATS WOMEN. COULDN'T YOU BOIL THIS BOOK DOWN  TO "BITCHES BE CRAZY"?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  SHE NOT NICE, EITHER. SHE'S NOT NICE, EITHER. >>UN, HE'S SHOOEZ NOT PERFECT  FOR SURE. SHE'S LIMITED --
Stephen:  SHE KILLS  SOMEONE.
BUT REMEMBER-- WELL, IT IS AN  ACCIDENT. REMEMBER, THE FACT THAT DAYS  SECERTAINLY RICH AND MAYBE EVEN  A LITTLE SHALLOW IS WHAT DRAWS GATSBY TO HER IN THE FIRST  PLACE.
Stephen:  DO YOU THINK THAT  THIS BOOK IS WORTHY OF THE  ATTENTION IT GETS? BECAUSE EVERY HIGH SCHOOL KID  HAS TO READ IT? SHOULD WE BE FORCING THIS ON  CHILDREN? ( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW, IT HAS A LOT OF  QUALITIES THAT MAKE IT GREAT. ONE OF THOSE QUALITIES I THINK  ALSO MAKES IT APPEALING AS A  HIGH SCHOOL BOOK IT IS SHORT.
YES. I READ IT DURING THE COMMERCIAL  BREAK. ( LAUGHTER )
AND THE THING IS UPON IT'S  VERY COMPRESSED WHICH REALLY IS  THE JOB OF FICTION. AND AS I SAID BEFORE I THINK HE  CAPTURES SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT  BEING AN AMERICAN IS-- THE AMERICAN PSYCHE, IF YOULET,  WHICH HAS I THINK FROM THE VERY  BEGINNING HAS EVOLVED A WILLINGNESS TO TURN ONE'S BACK  ON THE PAST AND TURN IT AROUND.
Stephen:  IT'S THE  QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN THING TO  PRESENT YOURSELF TO THE WORLD AS A FALSE IMAGE OF YOURSELF. ( LAUGHTER )  TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU BUT THEY  NEVER GET TO MEET THE REAL YOU. I WISH I COULD DO THAT. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  JENNIFER EGAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD,  JENNIFER EGAN, WE'LL BE
