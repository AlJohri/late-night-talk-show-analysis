Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS VERY MUCH. HELLO TO ALL OF YOU HERE IN  THE STUDIO WATCHING FROM  HOME OR READING MY PROMPTER AT THE NSA. SPOILER ALERT, GUYS, THIS IS  THE NEXT SENTENCE. NOW IT'S NO SECRET I'M IN  FAVOR OF GOVERNMENT  SURVEILLANCE. IT'S CERTAINLY NO SECRET  FROM THE GOVERNMENT. BUT EVER SINCE THE LEAKS  FROM NSA TRADER AND GUESTS  AT YOUR WEDDING IT NO ONE  SEEMS TO KNOW, EDWARD SNOWDEN, WE'VE ALL HAD  QUESTIONS ABOUT DOMESTIC  FINES, HOW MUCH DO THEY KNOW  ABOUT IT AS MUCH AS FACEBOOK OR NOTHING AT ALL BECAUSE  THEY'RE USING GOOGLE PLUS. WELL, I HAVE TO HAND IT TO  THE PRESIDENT FOR ADDRESSING  AMERICA'S CONCERNS LAST WEEK ON THE NBC NIGHTLY LENO.
THERE IS NO SPYING ON  AMERICANS. WE DON'T HAVE A DOMESTIC  SPYING PROGRAM.
Stephen: SEE, NO DOMESTIC  SPYING PROGRAM. BECAUSE IT'S CLEARLY NOT DOM  ES AT THIS KATED. IT'S NOT EVEN HOUSEBROKEN. LOOK AT ALL THE LEAKS. THE POINT IS THEY'RE NOT  SPYING ON US, END OF STORY. NOW THE REST OF THE STORY IS  THAT THE PRESIDENT GAVE US  MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE  PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T HAVE AT A SECRET PRESS  CONFERENCE. SECRET IN THAT IT WAS HELD  AT 3 P.M. ON A FRIDAY IN  AUGUST. BY THEN WOLF BLITZER IS  ALREADY THREE MARGARITAS  DEEP IN THE SITUATIONAR. AND-- THAT WAS GOOD, THAT  WAS FUN. AND NATION, THE PRESIDENT  HAS HEARD YOUR CALLS FOR  MORE OVERSIGHT. IN FACT, HE'S HEARD ALL YOUR  CALLS. BUT MAYBE JUST MAYBE NOT ANY  MORE.
WE'RE FORMING A HIGH  LEVEL GROUP OF OUTSIDE  EXPERTS TO REVIEW OUR ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE AND  COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. I'M TASKING THIS INDEPENDENT  GROUP TO STEP BACK AND  REVIEW OUR CAPABILITIES.
Stephen: SEE, OUTSIDE  EXPERTS, INDEPENDENT GROUPS,  WHICH WILL BE CLOSE ENBY INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE DIRECTOR  OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE  JAMES-- THE GUY WHO LIED TO CONGRESS ABOUT THE SPYING  PROGRAM FIVE MONTHS AGO, BUT  ASSURED US THAT HE WAS BEING THE LEAST UNTRUTHFUL HE  COULD. (LAUGHTER)  AND I AM CONFIDENT, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN, I'M CONFIDENT  THAT THE GROUP'S REPORT WILL CONTAIN THE MOST TRANSPARENT  BLOEP BLOEP LEGALLY ALLOWED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL THIS NEW REVIEWING AND  OVERSIGHTING IS IMPORTANT TO  REASSURE THE PUBLIC AS THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED IN TERMS  WE CAN ALL UNDERSTAND.
IF I TELL MICHELLE THAT I  DID THE DISHES, NOW GRANTED  IN THE WHITE HOUSE I DON'T DO THE DISHES THAT MUCH. BUT BACK IN THE DAY, AND SHE  IS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL. WELL, I WOULD LIKE HER TO  TRUST ME BUT MAYBE I NEED TO  BRING HER BACK AND SHOW HER THE DISHES. AND NOT JUST HAVE HER TAKE  MY WORD FOR IT.
Stephen: AND FOLKS, I CAN  UNDERSTAND WHY SHE WOULD BE  SKEPTICAL. BECAUSE HE JUST WENT ON LENO  AND SAID WE DON'T HAVE A  DOMESTIC DISH PROGRAM. NOW BOTTOM LINE-- BOTTOM  LINE, FOLKS, I BELIEVE WHAT  THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT OUR DISHWASHERS  ARE RECORDING EVERYTHING WE  SAY. NOW TO BE CLEAR--   (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES. NOW TO BE CLEAR THESE  REFORMS HAD NOTHING TO DO  WITH THE DISCLOSURES OF  EDWARD SNOWDEN.
I CALLED FOR A THOROUGH  REVIEW OF OUR SURVEILLANCE  OPERATIONS BEFORE  MR. SNOWDEN MADE THESE  LEAKS. I ACTUALLY THINK WE WOULD  HAVE GOTTEN TO THE SAME  PLACE.
YEAH, HE CALLED FOR THESE  A LONG TIME AGO. HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO THE  SAME PLACE WHICH MEANS THAT  ED SNOWDEN HAS RUINED THE PRESIDENT'S SURPRISE. BARACK OBAMA, BARACK OBAMA  WAS PLANNING ALL ALONG TO  THROW A BIG  TRANSPARENT-- TRANSPARENCY PARTY AND HOLD THE SAME  PRESS CONFERENCE. IN FACT, I'VE GOT A COPY OF  THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH THAT  WE NEVER GOT TO HEAR. HERE WE GO, ALL RIGHT.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I  COME TO YOU WITH PORN NEWS. THERE ARE SOME SECRET THINGS  YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT, THAT  IF YOU HAD KNOWN ABOUT THEM MIGHT HAVE MADE YOU ANGRY,  WELL, GOOD NEWS, WE ARE  MAKING SIGNIFICANT  REDUCTIONS IN THOSE THINGS WHICH TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT  SAYING WE ARE DOING, BUT  REST ASSURED WE ARE NOT  DOING THEM FOR YOUR OWN GOOD AND ARE NOW NOT DOING THEM  IN A SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE  MANNER. I WILL NOW NOT TAKE YOUR  QUESTIONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. KMEERS PLAUS
