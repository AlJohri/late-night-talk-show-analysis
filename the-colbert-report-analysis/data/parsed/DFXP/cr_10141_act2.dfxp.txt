Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, AS A PROFESSIONAL NEWSMAN I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR INNOVATIONS IN JOURNALISM. FROM THE FUTURISTIC NEWSDESK OF SHEP SMITH TO THE 3D ENVIRONMENT OF WOLF BLITZER TO WHATEVER ALUMINUM ALLOY ANDERSON COOPER IS SCULPTED FROM. TODAY I SAW A TROUBLING GLIMPSE OF BROADCASTING FUTURE AND LIKE MOST TROUBLING THINGS I SAW IT AT A COUNTY FAIR.
WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE RIDE.
IT WAS GREAT, AND APPARENTLY, I'VE NEVER BEEN ON LIVE TELEVISION BEFORE. BUT APPARENTLY SOMETIMES I DON'T WATCH-- I DON'T WATCH THE NEWS, BECAUSE I'M A KID AND APPARENTLY EVERY TIME, APPARENTLY GRANDPA JUST GIVES ME THE REMOTE AFTER WE WATCH OT POWERBALL. AND I'VE NEVER, EVER BEEN ON LIVE TELEVISION. I NEVER EVER BEEN ON LIVE TELEVISION.
ARE YOU EXCITED.
YEAH, AND APPARENTLY I ALREADY WENT DOWN THE SUPERSLIDE. I WENT DOWN, I WAS SCARED HALF TO DEATH.
OH MY GOD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THIS KID IS A NATURAL-BORN NEWSMAN. I MEAN HE'S ALREADY BREAKING THE STORY OF HOW THE SUPERSLIDE IS HALF DEATH SCARING OUR CHILDREN. AND FOLKS, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM THAT INTERVIEW BUT APPARENTLY THIS CHILD HAS NEVER BEEN ON LIVE TELEVISION BEFORE. NOW I ALREADY ANNOUNCED THIS SPRING THAT I WAS ENDING THIS SHOW. BUT I HAVEN'T FULLY EXPLAINED WHY. I KNOW, I KNOW, THAT'S HOW I FEEL WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR. ONE REASON I'M ENDING THE SHOW IS THAT WHEN I CALLED COMCAST TO GET OUT OF MY CABLE SUBSCRIPTION IT TURNED IT WAS EASIER FOR ME JUST TO GET OUT OF CABLE ALL TOGETHER. BUT NOW--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUT NOW I FINALLY, HUGE COMCAST FANS HERE. BUT NOW I'VE GOT AN EVEN BETTER REASON. NEWS ANCHOR BABIES LIKE THIS ARE BREATHING DOWN MY NECK. AT 5 YEARS OLD HE'S ALREADY GOT THE SINCERITY OF EDWARD R MURROW, THE REASSURING GAZE OF WALTER CRONKITE AND MORE GRAVITAS THAN STEVE DOOCY. AND HE'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE WORD "APPARENTLY" AS HIS CATCH-PHRASE. THAT IS THE SORT OF SENSELESS REPETITION THAT MARKS A REAL NEWS LEGEND LIKE SEAN HANNITY.
WE WERE AT ANOTHER IRON DOME LOCATION, REMEMBER THERE'S NINE OF THEM THAT LITERALLY COVER THE ENTIRE STATE OF ISRAEL, LITERALLY WE HEARD AN IRON DOME GO OFF, WE LITERALLY WENT TO THE BORDER, LITERALLY IF YOU ARE 5, 10 YOU COULD WALK IN THAT TINL. I LITERALLY WALKED DOWN A SLOPE.
I LITERALLY WALKED.
LITERALLY
LITERALLY.
LITERALLY BEHIND ME.
Stephen: APPARENTLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) APPARENTLY THAT FIVE-YEAR-OLD CHILD COULD REPLACE SEAN HANNITY. LITERALLY. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
