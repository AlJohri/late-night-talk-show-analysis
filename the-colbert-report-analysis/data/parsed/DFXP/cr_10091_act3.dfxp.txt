WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER WHO WANTS PEOPLE TO MEMORIZE THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS I DON'T KNOW, IT DIDN'T END WELL FOR THE FIRST GUY WHO MEMORIZED IT. PLEASE WELCOME KEN BURNS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, HOW ARE YOU. WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, EVERYBODY KNOWS KEN BURNS, CIVIL WAR, BASEBALL, YOU GOT HOW MANY, YOU GOT TWO GRAMMYS, THREE PEABODY'S, MOST IMPRESSIVELY THIS IS YOUR SIXTH TRIP BACK TO MY SHOW.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WHAT KEEPS THE KEN BURNS MOTOR RUNNING?
I'M WORKING SEVEN PROJECTS AT ONCE AND-- YOU'RE KIDDING.
NO, SEVEN.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
I DO.
Stephen: YOU'RE ADDICTED TO HISTORY.
I AM ADDICTED TO HISTORY AND I WOULD BE PREGNANT IF I WERE A WOMAN BECAUSE I CAN'T SAY NO TO A PROJECT.
Stephen: WOW! THAT'S BOLD. OKAY. YOUR NEW PROJECT IS CALLED THE ADDRESS, FILM BY KEN BURNS. IT JUST PREMIERED APRIL 15th. IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON DVD FROM THE GOOD PEOPLE AT PBS. NOW THE ADDRESS, THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS, YOU KNOW IT GETS A LOT OF PRESS, A LOT OF PRESS BECAUSE IT IS SHORT, YOU KNOW IT IS EASY TO GET THROUGH.
IT'S LINCOLN-- .
Stephen: BUT IS IT REALLY THAT GOOD? OR HOW MUCH OF IT IS HYPE?
NO HYPE, IT'S REALLY THAT GOOD.
Stephen: IT'S ONLY 272 WORDS. IF IT WAS GOOD, I'M GOING TO KEEP TALKING IF IT WAS GOOD, WOULDN'T THERE BE MORE OF IT?
NO, THAT'S THE BEAUTY. PURE PRESIDENTIAL POETRY, HE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. BECAUSE THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL BUT HE OWNED OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. LINCOLN FREED THOSE HUMAN BEINGS AND SET IN MOTION A KIND OF 2.0 VERSION WHICH THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS IS WE HAVEN'T REPLACED IT. AND IN 272 WORDS, IN 10 SENTENCE, THE FIRST ONE FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS IS WHERE WE'VE BEEN, NOW WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GREAT CIVIL WAR IS WHERE WE ARE, AND THE REST ARE ABOUT PULLING US INTO A FUTURE THAT WE HAVE BECOME. HE ASKED US TO BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF PEOPLE TO HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM. AND THIS FILM IS ABOUT A SMALL SCHOOL IN VERMONT WHERE THE KIDS SUFFER FROM DISLEXIA, ADHD, A WHOLE HOST OF LEARNING DIFFERENCES THAT MAKES THEIR PASSAGE THROUGH SCHOOL VERY CHALLENGING. BUT EACH YEAR THE SCHOOL FOR THE 35 YEARS IT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE HAS CHALLENGED THE KIDS TO FIRST MEMORIZE IT AND THEN PUBLICLY RECITE THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.
Stephen: AND THEY COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BE THE ONE WHO GETS TO DO THIS.
NO, NO, THEY ALL DO IT THEY ALL MEMORIZE IT, AND THEY HAVE ALL-- .
Stephen: BUT DOES SOMEBODY WIN, ISN'T THERE A WINNER, IS THERE A WINNER? BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING CHILD FIGHTS AGAINST EACH OTHER. JUST 50 CHILDREN.
EXACTLY, NO, NO, THERE IS A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND A HIGH SCHOOL, FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD. BUT THEY'RE ALL WINNERS BECAUSE THEY OVERCOME THIS, LOOK, WE DON'T DO ANY  MEMORIZATION IN SCHOOL ANY MORE. WE USED TO MEMORIZE A LOT OF STUFF.
I DIDN'T DO IT BEFORE.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP OF THE FILM. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
WE HAVE DIVIDED THE GETTYSBURG INTO FIVE PARAGRAPHS FOR LEARNING.
FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO OUR FATHERS-- BROUGHT FORTH ON THIS CONTINENT A NEW NATION WITH LIBERTY AND DEDICATED TO THE -- THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.
YOU DID THAT VERY WELL. CAN YOU TELL THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON IN PARAGRAPH 1, ABOUT FOUR SCORE.
HOW AMERICA CAME TOGETHER,  AND THEN WHAT'S HAPPENING.
OUR FATHERS BROUGHT FORTH
ON THIS CONTINENT A NEW NATION DEDICATED
TO THE PROPOSITION THAT
ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.
Stephen: IF LINCOLN HAD LOST THE WAR WOULD WE BE  MEMORIZING THIS SPEECH?
THAT'S SO INTERESTING.
Stephen: OF COURSE, I ASKED IT? (LAUGHTER)
SELBY FOOT IN THE CIVIL WAR SAID AS A MISSISSIPPIAN THAT EVEN THOUGH HE, HIS PEOPLE HAD LOST THE CIVIL WAR, HE WAS ASKED TO MEMORIZE IT BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF DICTION SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF RHETORIC THAT IT SORT OF WOULD BE REMEMBERED REGARDLESS. SO I HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE OTHER WAY.
Stephen: YOU STARTED ANOTHER PROJECT, WHAT IS IT CALLED, LEARN THE ADDRESS.
YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY IN AMERICA TO LEARN THIS ADDRESS.
YES, WE WERE CHALLENGING EVERYBODY. IF YOU GO TO LEARN THE ADDRESS.ORG YOU HAVE ALL THE LIVING PRESIDENTS, NOTABLE PEOPLE, STEPHEN COLBERT, LOTS OF-- .
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET HIM? (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS REALLY TOUGH. IT WAS TOUGH BUT HE DID IT.
Stephen: BUT WHY THIS ADDRESS? I MEAN THERE ARE SOME GREAT PRESIDENTIAL SPEECHES OUT THERE. WHY NOT WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON'S 8400-WORD PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL ADDRESS THAT WAS SO POWERFUL THAT IT KILLED HIM.
THAT HE DIED!
Stephen: ONE MONTH LATER. I MEAN THAT IS A SPEECH TO MEMORIZE. (APPLAUSE) MAYBE THE NEXT FILM.
MAYBE, THE PRESIDENCY OF WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE A VERY SHORT DOCUMENTARY. IT'S A STATION BREAK ON PBS.
THEN I CAN'T DO IT.
Stephen: KEN BURNS, THE ADDRESS, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
