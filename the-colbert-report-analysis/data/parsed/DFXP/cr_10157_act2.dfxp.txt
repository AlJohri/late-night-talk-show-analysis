STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH! FOLKS, AS A CONSERVATIVE PUNDIT, IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO CAREFULLY WEIGH THE FACTS AND OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE HOW OUR PRESIDENT IS WRONG. AND WHEN IT COMES TO ANALYZING WHAT'S GOING ON IN SKULL FORCE ONE, MY HERO HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER HARVARD-TRAINED PSYCHIATRIST, CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, WHO RECENTLY ENRICHED OUR PUBLIC DEBATE ON THE HUGH HEWITT SHOW.
I KNOW YOU'VE SAID BEFORE YOU NO LONGER PRACTICE PSYCHIATRY. YOU'VE GIVEN THAT UP. BUT I WANT TO TEMPT YOU TO DO A LITTLE ARMCHAIR DIAGNOSIS HERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HIS MENTAL STATE?
LOOK, I HAVE FORESWORN PSYCHIATRY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN'T DO IT AT A DISTANCE. SO I DECIDED, WHEN I LEFT PSYCHIATRY, NEVER TO USE MY AUTHORITY.
STEPHEN: GOOD FOR HIM. HE HAS SWORN NOT TO USE HIS PSYCHIATRIC AUTHORITY. SO I GUESS THIS INTERVIEW'S OVER.
BUT LET ME JUST SAY AS A LAYMAN, WITHOUT INVOKING ANY EXPERTISE, OBAMA IS CLEARLY A NARCISSIST.
STEPHEN: OBAMA IS CLEARLY A NARCISSIST. WE STILL HAVEN'T FOUND THAT BIRTH CERTIFICATE. HE COULD EASILY BE FROM NARCISSISTAN. OF COURSE, BEING A NARCISSIST IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING. IN FACT, WHEN YOU LOOK UP NARCISSIST IN THE DICTIONARY, IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO A PICTURE OF ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND, YES, I'VE PASTED MY PHOTO NEXT TO EVERY WORD IN MY DICTIONARY. BUT WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M A BIT OF AN AARDVARK. AND KRAUTHAMMER IS WILLING TO BACK UP HIS NON-DIAGNOSIS WITH HARD NON-DATA.
I MEAN, COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES HE USES THE WORD "I" IN ANY SPEECH. REMEMBER WHEN HE ANNOUNCED THE KILLING OF BIN LADEN? THAT SPEECH, I BELIEVE, HAD 29 REFERENCES TO "I." ON MY COMMAND, I ORDERED, AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, I WAS THEN TOLD, I THIS.
STEPHEN: YES, OBAMA IS OBSESSED WITH SAYING "I." CAN'T HE FIND A BETTER WAY TO REFER TO HIMSELF? "ME "CAN. AND REMEMBER THE HIGH MATH THAT COUNT KRAUTULA DID FOR US -
THAT SPEECH HAD, I BELIEVE, 29 REFERENCES TO "I."
STEPHEN: THOSE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. THOUGH, EVIDENTLY HE DOES. BECAUSE I'VE READ THE SPEECH AND BARACK OBAMA USED THE WORD "I" 11 TIMES IN HIS BIN LADEN SPEECH, NOT 29, AS COMPARED TO KRAUTHAMMER, WHO SAID "I" 36 TIMES IN THAT INTERVIEW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NOW, FOLKS, FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE FORESWORN MY PSYCHIATRIC AUTHORITY BECAUSE I NEVER HAD ANY AND, TO BE CLEAR, I AM NOT CLAIMING ANY INSIGHT OR TRAINING OR INTEREST IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR, BUT IN MY LAYMAN'S OPINION, AS IF I WERE RAISED BY WOLVES, I JUST WANT TO SAY A FORMER PSYCHIATRIST WILLING TO GIVE AN ON-AIR DIAGNOSIS OF A STRANGER, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CLAIMING HE ISN'T DOING THAT, IS NOT A NARCISSIST, HE'S JUST KIND OF A DICK. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
