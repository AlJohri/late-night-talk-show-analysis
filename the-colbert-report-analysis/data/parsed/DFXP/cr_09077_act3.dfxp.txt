Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ON A  NATIONWIDE CREW SIDE AGAINST  SUGAR. NEXT A BRUTAL CRACKDOWN ON SPICE  AND EVERYTHING NICE. PLEASE WELCOME DR. ROBERT  LUSTIG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  COMING ON.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: LET'S GET YOUR CV  OUT HERE QUICK. YOU ARE A PEDIATRIC  ENDOCRINOLOGIST WHO HAS SPENT  THE PAST 15 YEARS TREATING  CHILDHOOD OBESEITS. YOU HAVE A BOOK CALLED FAT  CHANCE, BEATING THE ODDS AGAINST  SUGAR, PROCESSED FOOD, OBESITY AND DISEASE. WHAT IS YOUR BEEF WITH SUGAR?
IF SUGAR WERE JUST EMPTY  CALORIES, THEN THE FOOD  INDUSTRY, THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE, THE NATIONAL  INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, THE  SURGEON GENERAL AND EVERYBODY  ELSE WOULD BE RIGHT TO. BE PART OF A BALANCED DIET YOU  GET DISCRETIONARY SUGAR, NO  PROBLEM.
Stephen: IT IS.
A CALORIE IS NOT A CALORIE. THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE YOU  BELIEVE.
Stephen: THOSE ARE EXPERTS. SMART GUYS WITH LETTERS AFTER  THEIR NAMES JUST LIKE YOU DO. WHY ARE YOU RIGHT AND EVERYBODY  ELSE IS WRONG? WE'LL TAKE ONE EXAMPLE. ALCOHOL.
Stephen: ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT. AND I DO, TOO BUT IN LOW DOSE.
Stephen: SURE, ABSOLUTELY  SLOW DRIP.
ABSOLUTELY. INFUSE IT JUST ENOUGH SO THAT --
Stephen: GETS YOU THERE,  BABY. THAT LITTLE CLICK.
ALCOHOL ARE NOT EMPTY  CALORIES. THEY ARE TOXIC CALORIES. WHY? FRIES YOUR LIVER. SO DOES SUGAR. WE'VE DONE TWO LIVER TRANSPLANTS  AN 15-YEAR-OLD SODA DRINKERS AT  UCSF.
Stephen: YOU CALL SUGAR A  POISON.
IN HIGH DOSE.
Stephen: WHY NOT A MORE  ALARMING TERM LIKE SUGAR IS  HITLER. THESE TWO KIDS ARE OUTLIERS IT'S  TRAGIC. THEY ARE OUTLIERS.
NO THEY ARE NOT. 32% OF AMERICA HAS NONALCOHOLIC  FATTY LIVER DISEASE.
Stephen: IF WE HAVE THAT IT  MEANS WE'RE EVEN MORE ELITE AS  PEOPLE. WE'RE TRY TURNING OURSELVES INTO  FOIE GRAS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WHAT IS GOOD FOR  THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE  GANDER.
THE WAY YOU MAKE FOIE GRAS IS  BY FEEDING THE ANIMAL  CARBOHYDRATES, SPECIFICALLY  SUGAR.
Stephen: IF I DON'T EAT THE  SUGAR I WILL NEVER DIE.
YOU MIGHT LIVE LONGER AND  THAT'S WHAT THE DATA SHOWS. WE'RE AWASH IN THE STUFF. THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION  SAYS WE CURRENTLY CONSUME 22  TEASPOONS OF SUGAR PER DAY, AVERAGE FOR AMERICA. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO REDUCE THAT  TO 6-9. BECAUSE OF HALF OF SUGAR WE  CONSUME IS FOODS WE DON'T KNOW  HAD IT LIKE SALAD DRESSING. TOMATO SAUCE. HAMBURGER MEAT, ASK TACO BELL.
Stephen: HAMBURGER MEAT?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY IT'S SO  GOOD.
THEY KNOW WHEN THEY PUT IT IN  YOU BUY MORE. IT'S CALLED ADDICTION.
Stephen: I WANTED TO  MAINLINE TACO MEAT.
I'M SURE YOU HAVE.
Stephen: IT'S ALL SUGAR. I HEAR THAT HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN  SYRUP HAS A COUPLE OF SKULL AND  CROSS BONES.
ALL THE DATA SHOWS HIGH  FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP IS THE SAME. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S CHEAPER. IT MADE SUGAR CHEAPER AND  THEREFORE IT STARTED APPEARING  IN ALL SORTS OF FOODS.
Stephen: HIGH FRIEWK HE IS  TO CORN SYRUP IT'S NATURAL. LIKE PARSLEY OR HEMLOCK. IT'S A NATURAL GROWING THING. IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT THE NATURAL  SUGAR DOES, TOO. THERE ARE 56 NAMES FOR SUGAR YOU  DON'T KNOW THEM.
Stephen: HAD YOU DO YOU  KNOW I DON'T KNOW THEM. MAYBE I'M AN ESKIMO OF SUGAR. I HAVE 56 NAMES FOR SNOW.
MAYBE YOU DO. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY DOESN'T  AND THEY ARE BUYING IT AND THEY  DON'T KNOW IT.
Stephen: DR.S BUT -- DR. BUZZ KILL.
YOU GAVE ME THAT NAME.
Stephen: YOU THROW AROUND  THE WORD PROCESSED FOOD.
THEY TAKE THE FIBER OUT FOR  SHELF LIFE. FINE FIBER IS GOOD FOUR. IT REDUCES HOW FAST THE STUFF IN  YOUR INTESTINES IS ABSORBS AND  IT KEEPS YOUR LIVER SAFE STEEFNLG THAT'S WHAT THE BOX IS  FOR FIBER.
THE WRAPPER HAS MORE HEALTH  BENEFITS USUALLY THAN THE FOOD  DOES. REALLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SO WHAT ARE THE  MORE NUTRITIOUS WRAPPERS I  SHOULD BE FEEDING MY CHILDREN? DOCTOR,ING THANK YOU SO MUCH --  DOCTOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME.
