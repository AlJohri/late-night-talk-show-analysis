WELCOME BACK, EVERYTHING, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS  FROM-- PLEASE WELCOME SHERYL SANDBERG. HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU THE COO OF FACEBOOK. BEFORE THAT YOU WORKED FOR GOOGLE, WERE CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT, AN ECONOMIST AT THE WORLD BANK. YOU ARE ALSO A BEST SELLING AUTHOR AND FOUNDER OF LEANIN.ORG AND YOU GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED LEANIN FOR GRADUATES.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, TELL ME, I HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS LEANIN THING. OKAY. CAN ANYBODY LEAN-IN OR DO ONLY WOMEN LEAN-IN?
ANYONE CAN LEAN-IN. ANYONE. AND WE LIKE IT WHEN MEN DO IT AS WELL.
HOW-- DO MEN AND WOMEN LEAN-IN DIFFERENTLY?
WELL, THEY LEAN-IN FOR THE SAME REASON, MAYBE DIFFERENT. THEY LEAN-IN TO CREATE A BETTER WORLD WHICH SHOULD BE A MORE EQUAL WORLD. ONE WHERE WOMEN RAN HALF OUR COMPANIES AND MAN RAN HALF OUR HOMES. AND SO THEY EACH HAVE THEIR PART TO PLAY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW I READ A STUDY WHERE THE MORE HOUSEWORK MEN DO, THE LESS SEX THEY HAVE.
SO THAT STUDY IS BASED ON A 1996 STUDY. AND IT'S VERY OUT OF DATE. HERE IS WHAT THE DATA SHOWS. THE DATA SAYS THAT IF YOU SHARE CHORES MORE EVENLY WHICH DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN NOW BUT COULD, YOU ARE HAPPIERIER, IF ARE YOU HAPPIER YOU HAVE MORE SEX. I TELL MEN IN YOU WANT MORE SEX WITH YOUR WIFE, DON'T BUY FLOWERS, DO LAUNDRY AND THIS WORKS.
Stephen: ISN'T THERE A DANGER I WILL END UP HAVING SEX WITH THE MADE THOUGH?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: OKAY.
THIS WORKS.
Stephen: I'M ALL FOR WOMEN WORKING. I LOVE WOMEN WORKING. I HAVE WOMEN WHO WORK HERE T THEY ARE FANTASTIC. YOU WORK.
I DO.
Stephen: SO-- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OLD THING I WAS TOLD YOU KNOW I READ, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T READ. I HEARD, I HEARD THAT WOMEN CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. HOW DO THEY HAVE IT ALL. WHAT ABOUT HAVING THE BABIES. BECAUSE MEN THROUGH NO FAULT OF OUR OWN HAVE NO WOMB. OKAY. I'VE TRIED.
THAT'S RIGHT. SO WE TELL WOMEN THEY CAN'T HAVE IT ALL. AND BY THAT MEAN THEY CAN'T WORK AND HAVE KIDS BUT NASS'S ABSURD BECAUSE 70% OF MOTHERS IN OUR ECONOMY WORK AND HAVE TO WORK. AND SO THEY ARE GOING TO WORK AND HAVE KIDS. AND THE WAY WE CAN GET THAT TO WORK OUT IS IF WHEN WOMEN ARE COMING INTO THE WORKFORCE, LIKE WE TRY TO ADVISE IN THIS BOOK, THEY CAN REACH, GET THE RIGHT JOBS, GET PAID THE SAME AS MEN.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON EQUAL PAYDAY, BY THE WAY.
YEAH.
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, WOMEN COME INTO THE WORKFORCE, COME INTO THE WORKFORCE AND THEY MAKE LESS THAN MEN. AND PART OF THE REASON IS THAT THEY CAN'T NEGOTIATE AS EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE WHEN A MAN NEGOTIATES, WE THINK HE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR HIMSELF. WHEN A WOMAN DOES-- .
Stephen: HELL YA, WE PUT OUR BALLS OUT THERE ON THE TABLE. I'M ALL IN, PUT THEM ON THE BELT.
THAT'S RIGHT, A NEW KIND OF LEANING IN, BUT WHEN A WOMEN NEGOTIATES SHE PAYS A PENALTIES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE PENALTY.
THEY'RE NOT LIKED. WHEN THEY ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES AND IF THEY ARE NOT LIKED THEY DON'T GET THE RAISES AND PROMOTIONS SO THERE A CHAPTER IN THE NEW BOOK FROM A COMPENSATION EXPERT AND SHE TEACHES WOMEN HOW TO NEGOTIATE SO COMMUNAL LANGUAGE. EXPLAIN WHY THE SALARY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR YOU, BUT IT WILL HELP YOU DO A BETTER JOB TO THE ORGANIZATION.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF WOMEN NOT LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND NOT THINKING THEY CAN STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES, SU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ITS WORD BOSSI.
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE WORD BOSS, SOME PEOPLE ARE BOSSI.
YEAH, WELL, THAT WORD IS USED LOT MORE WITH -- IT IS GETTING AT A VERY REAL PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT BY JUNIOR HIGH MORE GIRLS, PORE BOYS WANT TO LEAD THAN GIRLS. AND WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHY, THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED BOSSI. AND SO WE PUT OUT A SERIES OF LEADERSHIP TIPS FOR PARENTS HOW ALL OF US TREAT OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS EQUALLY. AND FOR GIRLS BECAUSE IF WE WANT EQUAL REPRESENTATION AT THE TABLE WHERE DECISIONS ARE MADE, WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE LEADERSHIP AND WE NEED TO START YOUNG DOING.
Stephen: BUT ISN'T, YOU KNOW, TELLING PEOPLE WHAT WORDS NOT TO SAY KIND OF PUSHY?
OR EVEN BOSSI.
Stephen: OH, I WOULD NEVER SAY BOSSI.
NEVER SAY BOSSI.
Stephen: BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT BITE MY HEAD OFF.
WELL, THIS GOES WAY BEYOND A WORD AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT SYSTEMIC ENCOURAGEMENT OF LITTLE GIRLS AND I THINK IS SOMETHING WE CAN CHANGE.
Stephen: I HAVE WOMEN IN MY WIFE. I HAVE A DAUGHTER. HOW I DO ENCOURAGE HER TO LEAN IN. SHE'S IN THE A GRADUATE YET BUT HOW DO I ENCOURAGE HER.
SO BY JUNIOR HIGH PARENTS HAVE HIGHER ASPIRATIONS IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP FOR THEIR SONS THAN THEIR DAUGHTERS, SO WHEN THEY TALK TO THEIR SONS ABOUT THEIR FUTURE, THEY ASK THEM, LIKE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD, BIGGER QUESTIONS, WITH THE DAUGHTERS THEY DON'T ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS. ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS LOOK AT YOUR DAUGHTER AND SAY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LEAN N WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE DIFFERENT.
Stephen: WHY DO I HAVE TO USE THE NAME OF YOUR BOOK.
YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T. THAT'S OPTIONAL. IT'S OPTIONAL.
Stephen: S THIS'S INCREDIBLE. MARKETING. YOU JUST DID, IT WAS AMAZING.
BUT THAT'S PART'S OPTIONAL BUT THE AMBITION IS NOT OPTIONAL. BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENGRAIN-- EMBRACE AM BILLS. NEXT TIME YOU SEE SOMEONE CALL A LITTLE GIRL BOSSI WALK UP TO THEM AND SAY THAT LITTLE GIRL IS NOT BOSSI THAT LITTLE GIRL HAS EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP SKILLS.
Stephen: SO GET OFF, GET OFF THE SEA SAW, IT'S HER TURN.
OR SHARE THE SEESAW BECAUSE WILL YOU MAKE BETTER DECISIONS TOGETHER. WHEN WOMEN ARE AT THE TABLE MAKING DECISIONS WITH MEN, I KNOW THAT IS HARD TO IMAGINE, BUT THE DECISIONS ARE BETTER.
Stephen: WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT NOW, HERE WE ARE.
Stephen: ARE YOU AT MY TABLE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE SHARING OUR TABLE AND WE'RE CHANGING THE WORLD ONE WORD AT A TIME.
AND I APPRECIATE THAT SSES YOU'RE WELCOME. BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED MY PERMISSION, YOU COULD HAVE COME AND DONE MY SHOW WITHOUT ASKING.
REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH, THIS IS YOUR TABLE TOO. THINK ANY TIME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ANY TIME YOU WANT TO COME BACK AND IF YOU CAN GET PAST SECURITY, ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY-- SHERYL SANDBERG, LEAN IN, FOR GRADUATES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
