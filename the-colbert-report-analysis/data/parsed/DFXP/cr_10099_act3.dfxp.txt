WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST EDWARD O WILSON IS A BIOLOGIST WHO SAYS HUMANS HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM ANTS. THAT'S WHY I NEVER LET ANYONE STAND OVER ME WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS. PLEASE WELCOME EO WILSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING, DR. WILSON. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. FOR THE FEW OUT THERE WHO DON'T KNOW YOU ARE ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTHORITIES ON ANTS. AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF BIODIVERSITY BUT YOU ARE THE ANT MAN, RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE ANT MAN. 60 YEARS IN THE FIELD, YOU CREATED TWO SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. YOU RECEIVED TWO PULITZER, HAVE WRITTEN 30 BOOKS AND YOUR LATEST IS CALLED A WINDOW ON ETERNITY, A BIOLOGIST'S WALK THROUGH  GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK. WE WILL GET TO THE BOOK IN JUST ONE SECOND. WHY ANTS? WHY DO WE-- WHY DO YOU-- WHY-- DID THE QUEEN SQUIRT SOME PHEROMONES ON YOU OR SOMETHING. WHY DID YOU TURN INTO A DRONE FOR ANTS?
WHY NOT ANTS? THEY'RE THE MOST ABUNDANT CREATURES ON EARTH OF INSECTS.
Stephen: THE MOST ABUNDANT CREATURES ON EARTH.
YEAH.
Stephen: A LOT OF CHINESE PEOPLE--  (LAUGHTER)
THERE ARE.
Stephen: THERE ARE A LOT OF CHINESE PEOPLE.
ANTS TAKEN ALL TOGETHER WEIGH ABOUT AS MUCH AS ALL THE HUMANS TAKEN TOGETHER.
Stephen: SO IT'S A FAIR FIGHT.
IT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: A FAIR FIGHT.
YEAH, IT IS.
Stephen: WHAT DREW YOU TO ANTS. WERE YOU A CHILD WHEN YOU WERE FIRST DRAWN TO THEM.
YEAH, I BEGAN I GUESS AS A CHILD.
Stephen: WE ALL DO.
AND I STARTED GETTING INTERESTED IN NATURAL HISTORY WHEN I WAS A KID. I WENT THROUGH THE BOY SCOUTS. I LOOKED AROUND AND I SAID WHAT CAN I DO THAT'S NEW IN THE WORLD, AND MIGHT GIVE ME A CAREER SO I CHOSE ANTS. WHAT MORE I CAN SAY? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. SO NOW THE BOOK ITSELF A WINDOW ON ETERNITY, WHAT IS GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK? WHERE IS THAT?
IN MOZAMBIQUE CLOSE TO THE ZIMBABWE BORDER.
Stephen: OKAY. AND SO YOU WALKED THROUGH IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. WELL, THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. SO I DON'T HAVE TO. I'M NOT A HUGE NATURE FAN I DON'T GO FOR A LOT OF WALKS. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM WALKING THROUGH A NATIONAL PARK, NOT AMERICA'S NATIONAL PARK, WE'VE GOT THE BEST NATURAL PARKS, DON'T WE?
WE DO.
Stephen: WE DO HAVE THE BEST NATIONAL PARKS.
WE DO. AND WE OUGHT TO BE VERY PROUD OF THAT AND TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEM, IN MY OPINION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE SHOULD.
BUT TO GET BACK, YES, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF BIODIVERSITY, VARIETY OF SPECIES IN A PARK LIKE THE ONE IN AFRICA THAT HAVEN'T BEEN STUDIED AT ALL AND YOU CAN BE A REAL EXPLORER. A YOUNG SCIENTIST CAN GO TO A PARK LIKE THAT IN AFRICA AND DISCOVER ALL SORTS OF NEW BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON AND NEW SPECIES AND SO ON. IT'S A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.
Stephen: NOW THIS PARK RECOVERED AFTER A WAR IN MOZAMBIQUE.
YEAH.
Stephen: IS IT DANGEROUS TO WALK THROUGH THERE, ARE THERE LANDMINES, UNSPENT SHELLS.
NOT THAT I HAVE DISCOVERED, FORTUNATELY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT HALF OF THE WORLD'S LAND SHOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR NATURAL PRESERVES LIKE THIS.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT WE NEED THAT LAND.
WE NEED IT.
Stephen: WHAT IF THERE IS OIL THERE?
I DON'T KNOW. SOLAR.
Stephen: SOLAR?
YEAH, WELL, ANYWAY, YEAH.
Stephen: WHY WOULD WE DO THAT? WHY WOULD YOU SET ASIDE HALF THE WORLD'S LAND. GOD GAVE US THE EARTH TO BE OUR DOMINION, TO EXPLOIT THE WAY WE NEEDED TO FOR HIS GREATER GLORY. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME THAT ONE.
THAT IS NOT THE WAY I READ THE BIBLE.
Stephen: I THINK YOU NEED TO REREAD IT. TRY SHOUTING THE BIBLE.
WE SHOULD, REMEMBER GENESIS, BRING FORTH THE COUNTLESS CREATURES TO SWIM IN THE SEA AND BIRDS TO CROSS THE VAULT OF HEAVEN. HE WANTS BIODIVERSITY.
Stephen: GOD WANTS BIODIVERSITY.
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT HE KILLED OFF A FEW THINGS. HE HAS, IN THE PERMIAN, 90% OF ALL LIFE DIED.
THAT HAPPENS ONCE IN A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS, ROUGHLY.
Stephen: MAYBE WE ARE UP FOR ANOTHER ONE.
MAYBE. WE'RE NOT UP FOR ANOTHER ONE, WE ARE THE OTHER ONE.
Stephen: WAIT A MINUTE.
YEAH.
Stephen: WE'RE DOING THE EXTINCTION OR WE WILL BE EXTINCT.
MAYBE BOTH. ANYWAY,-- .
Stephen: YOU JUST GLIDED RIGHT BY MANKIND'S EXTINCTION BUT AS LONG AS YOUR PRECIOUS ANTS SURVIVE, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW, AN EXPERIMENT WAS MADE IN BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY IN WHICH ORGANISMS WERE EXPOSED TO INTENSE RADIATION DAY AFTER DAY. AND ALL THE CREATURES THAT WERE IN THIS COMPOUND DIED AWAY AND FINALLY THE PLANTS WILTED DOWN AND GUESS WHAT CAME CRAWLING OUT OF THEIR NEST AND KEPT CRAWLING AROUND. ANTS.
Stephen: I FOR ONE WELCOME OUR NEW ANT OVERLORDS. AND I THANK YOU EO WILSON FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS A WINDOW ON ETERNITY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, SIR.
