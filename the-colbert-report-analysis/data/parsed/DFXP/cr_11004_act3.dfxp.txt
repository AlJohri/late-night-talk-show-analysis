Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALIST WHO'S BOOK IS CALLED "SALLY RIDE: AMERICA'S FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE." SHE REALLY SHATTERED THE GLASS  STRATOPHERE. PLEASE WELCOME LYNN SHERR! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LYNN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. NICE TO MEET YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE YOU.
Stephen:  YOU ARE AN EMMY AND PEABODY-AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR. YOU SPENT OVER 30 YEARS AT ABC NEWS. YOU COVERED THE NASA SPACE PROGRAM FROM 1981 TO 86, AND YOU BECAME FRIENDS WITH ASTRONAUT SALLY RIDE AND YOU HAVE A NEW BIOGRAPHY OF SALLY RIDE, YOUR FRIEND, "AMERICA'S FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE."
I DO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WHAT YEAR WAS SALLY RIDE THE FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE?
1983.
Stephen: 1983. THE RUSSIANS HAD ALREADY BEATEN US TO THE PUNCH.
TWICE.
Stephen: TWICE.
TWO RUSSIAN WOMEN HAD ALREADY GONE UP, ONE IN '63, AND ONE IN '82.
Stephen: HOW COME IF WE WERE IN A COLD WAR WE LET THE RUSKIES BEAT US WITH THE SPACE LADIES.
WHAT A GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: THANK YOU, IT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. WHY DID WE NOT PRIORITIZE THIS THE SAME WAY RUSSIA DID?
NASA DIDN'T THINK WOMEN WERE A PRIORITY. FIRST THERE WAS THE RACE TO GET TO THE MOON-- BOO IS RIGHT. BUT BEFORE SALLY RIDE FLEW, THE ONLY THREE FEMALES NASA HAS FLOWN WERE TWO SPIDERS AND A MONKEY. WOMEN WERE IN THE LOWEST PAYING JOBS IN NASA, AND BY THE TIME NASA GOT AROUND TO RECRUITING WOMEN, WHICH WAS 1976, THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HAD PRETTY MUCH FIGURED THAT OUT ALREADY, BUT THEY GOT THERE. AND ONCE THEY GOT THERE, THEY WENT FOR IT. SO IT HAD BEEN A MEN'S CLUB OF, A WHITE MEN'S CLUB, AND THEN ALONG CAME THEIR RECRUITMENT FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES AND THE WORLD CHANGE.
Stephen:  WELL, WHITE MEN'S CLUB WAS THERE FOR A WHILE BUT I GOTTA SAY, I DO ADMIRE WHAT SALLY RIDE DID. HOW LONG WAS SHE IN TRAINING BEFORE SHE WENT INTO SPACE?
WELL, SHE GOT TO NASA IN 1978. SHE WAS IN TRAINING AND NAMED AS THE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN TO FLY IN 1982. AND SHE FLEW IN 1983. SO HE HAD ALL THAT TRAINING AND THEN SHE HAD ONE YEAR OF REALLY, REALLY INTENSIVE TRAINING RIGHT BEFORE SHE FLEW.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, REALLY INTENSIVE TRAINING? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO? WHAT WERE THE PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS? WERE THERE SOME PHYSICAL THINGS THEY THOUGHT WOMEN COULDN'T DO THAT YOU HAD TO DO FOR SPACE SPACE?
EVERYTHING.
Stephen: WOMEN CAN FLOAT UPSIDE DOWN, I WOULD IMAGINE THAT.
THEY CERTAINLY CAN.
Stephen: WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO?
THE SAME THING THE MEN DO.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE, EITHER.
THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE TRAINING. THE MEN AND WOMEN TRAINED EXACTLY ALIKE. THEY HAD TO LEARN HOW TO JUMP OUT OF A PARACHUTE --
Stephen:  HOPEFULLY OUT OF A PLANE BUT IN THE PARACHUTE. JUMPING OUT OF THE PARACHUTE IS VERY TOUGH. THAT IS VERY TOUGH TRAINING.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE ASTRONAUTS ARE VERY SMART, SO-- THEY HAD TO DO WATER SURVIVAL TRAINING. HAD TO LEARN HOW ALL THE GADGETS AND ALL THE SWITCHES IN THE SHUTTLE, WHAT IS GOING ON, HOW TO MAKE IT WORK.
Stephen: DID HER NAME HELP IN THE CHOOSING PROCESS? FOR NASA? HER NAME IS SALLY RIDE. WAS SHE UP AGAINST LIKE EMILY SIPKOWITZ.
HERE'S WHAT IS AMAZING, HER REAL NAME IT'S RIDE FAMILY NAME GOES BACK ABOUT 400 YEARS IN ENGLAND. NO, HER NAME ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
Stephen: DIDN'T HELP AT ALL? NASA DIDN'T LIKE IT?
NO.
Stephen: IT LOOKED GREAT ON A PUBLICITY RELEASE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'LL ASK. I'LL DOUBLE CHECK THAT.
Stephen: PLEASE DO, PLEASE DO.
Stephen: IT WAS REVEALED IN HER OBITUARY, THE LAST LINE OF HER OBITUARY-- TELL THE PEOPLE THE LAST LINE OF HER OBITUARY.
IT WAS THAT SHE WAS SURVIVED BY HER SISTER AND HER MOTHER AND HER PARTNER OF 27 YEARS, TAM OSHAUGHNESSY.
Stephen: NOT EVERY OBITUARY HAS A PLOT TWIST RIGHT AT THE END. IT'S REVEALED THAT SHE HAD BEEN A LESBIAN.
YEAH.
Stephen: THE ENTIRE TIME OR DID SPACE DO THAT TO HER? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FANTASTIC FOUR. THE COSMIC RAYS-- THE COSMIC RAYS AND THEY GOT ALL FANTASTIC. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
WELL, IT'S KIND OF A MIXED STORY. BUT SHE GOT TOGETHER WITH TAM IN 1987.
Stephen: SO AFTER GOING TO SPACE.
AFTER GOING TO SPACE.
Stephen: OKAY, YES, ALL RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. THE WORLD WAS THEN NOT ACCEPTING, LET ALONE RECOGNIZING SAME-SEX COUPLES, AND SALLY CHOSE TO KEEP IT PRIVATE. SHE WAS A VERY PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL.
Stephen: NO BIOGRAPHIES, NO MOVIES ABOUT HER.
NOTHING IN HER LIFETIME. AND THIS ONLY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE HER PARTNER WANTED THE BIOGRAPHY DONE AFTER SALLY DIED. SALLY DIED IN 2012 AT THE AGE OF 61, TWO YEARS AGO. SHE NEVER-- I SPOKE TO HER MANY TIMES ABOUT IT. SHE WAS A VERY CLOSE FRIEND, AND SHE NEVER WANTED A BIOGRAPHY, AN ADULT BIOGRAPHY. THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS BIOGRAPHIES OUT THERE. BUT SHE NEVER WANTED A GROWN-UP BIOGRAPHY. AND I THINK PART OF IT WAS SHE WAS PROTECTING NASA. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE NASA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF DEALING WITH A WOMAN WHO WAS GAY, WHO HAD BEEN IN SPACE.
Stephen: DID SHE SEE HERSELF OR DID SHE FEEL HER ROLE WAS AN ICON OF SCIENCE OR OF FEMINISM? BECAUSE BOTH OF THOSE FRIGHTEN ME. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE TO TELL, YOU WOULD HAVE REALLY LIKED HER.
Stephen: WOULD I?
YOU WOULD HAVE REALLY LIKED HER BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS BOTH. SHE FELT BOTH AS A FEMINIST AND SCIENTIST. SHE BELIEVED WOMEN COULD DO ANYTHING. SHE GREW UP WITH PARENTS WHO BELIEVED WOMEN COULD DO ANYTHING. BUT SHE ALSO BELIEVED SCIENCE WAS GOING TO SAVE THE PLANET. WHEN SHE WAS UP IN SPACE, SHE LOOKED BACK AT EARTH, SHE SAW WHAT SHE CALLED THE SAN ROYAL BLUE LINE OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE, SUCH A FRAGILE SITUATION. WITHOUT THAT ATMOSPHERE, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. SHE WOULD SOMETIMES CALL IT AS THIN AS THE FUZZ ON A TENNIS BALL-- SHE WAS A TENNIS PLAYER AS WELL. AND SHE DEVOTED HER LIFE IN LARGE PART TO MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE PLANET AND SHE WANTED GIRLS, ESPECIALLY YOUNG GIRLS, TO STUDY SCIENCE SO THAIBD DO THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, THE BOOK IS "SALLY RIDE:  AMERICA'S FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE." LYNN SHERR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
