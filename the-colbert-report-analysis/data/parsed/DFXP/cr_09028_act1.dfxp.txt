Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT," EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH! CHANGE SO MUCH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU'RE TOO KIND. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, FOLKS I WISH EVERYBODY AT  HOME COULD BE HERE IN THE STUDIO  TONIGHT. THESE PEOPLE HAVE MADE ME FEEL  LIKE KING OF THE ROAD. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NATION, I AM HAPPY. IT'S THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. OR AS MY JEWISH VIEWERS CALL IT:  CHRISTMAS. (LAUGHTER)  NO EXCEPTIONS. BUT THERE IS ONE BIT OF YULETIDE  NEWS THAT'S MAKING VISIONS OF  ANGER PLUMS DANCE IN MY HEAD. JIM?
ONE MAN'S HEART IS TWO SIZES  TOO SMALL THIS HOLIDAY SEASON. HE WAS ARRESTED IN CANADA FOR  LYING AND TELLING KIDS THAT  SANTA CLAUS DOESN'T EXIST. 24-YEAR-OLD MAN WALKED THE  PARADE ROUTE IN ONTARIO SAYING  "SANTA'S NOT FOR REAL."
Stephen: NATION, THIS STORY  SICKENS ME. THIS CANADIAN GRINCH JUST LET  THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG. OR, AS THEY SAY IN CANADA, THE  BEAVER OUT OF THE BEAVER PELT  SATCHEL. (LAUGHTER)  THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF BEAVERS UP  THERE. IT'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING OF A  PROBLEM. (LAUGHTER)  BUT WHAT CAN I SAY? THERE'S NO POINT DENYING IT  ANYMORE: THERE IS NO SANTA CLAUS  (AUDIENCE REACTS)  IN CANADA. (LAUGHTER)  OKAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DOWN HERE HE'S REAL, OKAY? AND HE BRINGS TOYS TO ALL THE  GOOD GIRLS AND BOYS-- JUST NOT  IN CANADA. (LAUGHTER)  SOMETIMES HE FLIES OVER CANADA  ON HIS WAY TO AMERICA FROM THE  NORTH POLE AND OCCASIONALLY HE'LL STOP AT A TIM HORTON'S SO  HIS REINDEER CAN USE THE  BATHROOM. (LAUGHTER)  WORD TO THE WISE: DON'T GO IN  AFTER DONNER, OKAY? (LAUGHTER)  THERE'S A REASON HIS NAME IS  GERMAN FOR "THUNDER."  (LAUGHTER)  BUT HE DOESN'T STOP IN CANADA. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. A FLYING BEARDED MAN DELIVERING  TOYS ALL OVER THE WORLD IN A  SINGLE NIGHT? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HE ONLY HAS TIME TO DO IT IN ONE  COUNTRY. SO OBVIOUSLY HE'S GOING WITH  AMERICA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE COME  FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO LIVE  HERE? OUR HEALTH CARE? NO. (LAUGHTER)  WE HAVE SANTA. SO DON'T WORRY, CANADIAN KIDS,  YOU STILL HAVE A SANTA, IT'S  JUST A CANADIAN SANTA. EVERY YEAR I BELIEVE IT ROTATES  TO A DIFFERENT CANADIAN  CELEBRITY. LAST YEAR IT WAS NELLY  FURTADO-CLAUS. THIS YEAR IT'S RUSH. SO THAT JINGLE YOU HEAR ON THE  ROOF IS JUST NEIL PEART BREAKING  INTO A 45 MINUTE HIGH HAT SOLO. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOLKS, IT IS THE CHRISTMAS  SEASON AND THE FACT THAT CANADA  DOESN'T GET ONE BRINGS US ALL  JOY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT  THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING OUT  THERE TO SCARE US. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN THE CLOCK  STRIKES 12 ON NEW YEAR'S EVE YOU  CAN KISS YOUR DATE AND YOU CAN KISS OUR ECONOMY GOOD-BYE. BECAUSE WE WILL ALL BE GOING  OVER --
THAT FISCAL CLIFF.
FISCAL CLIFF.
FISCAL CLIFF.
THAT DREADED FISCAL CLIFF.
Stephen: YES, THE DREADED  FISCAL CLIFF. AN UNAVOIDABLE MONEY WILL  TECHNOLOGY THE RAZOR-SHARP  FINANCIAL ROCKS BELOW. IT ALL STARTED BACK IN 2011  DURING THE SHOWDOWN OVER RAISING  OUR DEBT CEILING WHEN REPUBLICANS WANTED SPENDING CUTS  AND OBAMA WANTED TO RAISE TAXES. WHICH LED TO A BUDGET CRISIS  THAT CONGRESS SOLVED BY NOT  SOLVING IT. (LAUGHTER)  INSTEAD, THEY HANDED IT OVER TO  SOMETHING CALLED "THE  SUPERCONGRESS" WHICH COULDN'T FAIL BECAUSE IT WAS SUPER. (LAUGHTER)  UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS ALSO  CONGRESS SO IT FAILED. (LAUGHTER)  AND AS A RESULT --  (APPLAUSE)  AS A RESULT --  (APPLAUSE)  AS A RESULT, FOLKS, WE ARE FACING ANOTHER THING CALLED  SEQUESTRATION WHICH AT FIRST  SOUNDS LIKE RATIONING THE AMOUNT YOU CAN WATCH "SEA QUEST."  (LAUGHTER)  BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THAT. (LAUGHTER)  SEQUESTRATION IS AUTOMATIC  SPENDING CUTS THAT BOTH SIDES  AGREE WOULD TRIGGER A NEW  RECESSION. IT'S LIKE CONGRESS PUT A GUN TO  THE ECONOMY'S HEAD AND SWORE IT  WILL PULL THE TRIGER IF CONGRESS DOESN'T PUT ITS OWN GUN DOWN. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MEXICAN  STANDOFF WITHOUT ANY MEXICANS. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, OBAMA'S ANSWER TO  THIS BUDGET CRISIS IS TO RAISE  TAXES ON THE WEALTHY JUST BECAUSE HE RAN ON THAT PROMISE. AND WON THE ELECTION. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S LIKE HE'S TOTALLY  DISREGARDING MY DISMISSIVE  FINGER QUOTES. WHAT PART OF THIS DON'T YOU  UNDERSTAND PRESIDENT "O" BAMA. (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S WHAT'S REALLY SCARING ME,  FOLKS. REPUBLICANS MIGHT LET HIM DO IT,  EVEN THOUGH EVERY REMEMBER IN  CONGRESS HAS SIGNED THE NEW TAXES PLEDGE CREATED BY THE  PRESIDENT OF AMERICANS FOR TAX  REFORM, GROVER NORQUIST. (THUNDER CLASHES)  THE TWO MOST TERRIFYING WORDS A  REPUBLICAN CAN HEAR OTHER THAN "BUENOS DIAS."  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  BUT NOW SOME REPUBLICANS ARE  ABANDONING THE ANTI-TAX PLEDGE AS FAST AS THEY ABANDONED -- OH,  WHAT'S HIS NAME? (LAUGHTER)  I GOT IT, DON'T HELP ME, DON'T  HELP ME. RIP FLAMBE. (LAUGHTER)  NO, NO, THAT'S MY PERSONAL TRAIN  TRAINER. (LAUGHTER)  NO, THE POINT IS CONSERVATIVES  ARE JUMPING SHIP.
I WANT TO BUY DOWN DEBT AND  CUT RATES THAT CREATE JOBS BUT I  WILL VIOLATE THE PLEDGE, LONG STORY SHORT, FOR THE GOOD OF THE  COUNTRY.
I'M NOT OBLIGATED ON THE  PLEDGE. THE ONLY THING I'M HONORING IS  THE OATH THAT I TAKE WHEN I  SERVE -- WHEN I'M SWORN IN THIS  JANUARY.
A PLEDGE YOU SIGNED 20 YEARS  AGO, 18 YEARS AGO IS FOR THAT  CONGRESS. FOR INSTANCE, IF I WAS IN  CONGRESS IN 1941 I WOULD HAVE  SIGNED THE -- SUPPORTED A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST  JAPAN. I'M NOT GOING TO ATTACK JAPAN  TODAY. THE WORLD HAS CHANGED.
Stephen: YOU HEARD IT, FOLKS. CONGRESSMAN PETER KING IS NOT  ONLY RAISING YOUR TAXES, HE'S  SURRENDERING THEOJO AND HIS  BOYS. (LAUGHTER)  NOT ME! I WILL NEVER GIVE UP THE TIGHT  AGAINST EMPEROR HIROHITO AND HIS  KAMIKAZE BEAST MEN. BESIDES, THAT'S A LOT OF TOUGH  TALK FROM A KNOWN LESBIAN. (LAUGHTER)  GROVER AND I KNOW THAT THE  PLEDGE LASTS A LOT LONGER THAN  TWO YEARS.
CONGRESSMAN PETER KING OF NEW  YORK KNOWS FULL WELL THAT THE  PLEDGE THAT HE SIGNED AND OTHERS HAVE IS FOR WHY YOU'RE IN  CONGRESS. IT'S NOT FAR TWO-YEAR PERIOD.
Stephen: YES, AN ANTI-TAX  PLEDGE IS ETERNAL AND  UNBREAKABLE. IT'S LIKE A PACT WITH THE DEVIL  OR A GYM MEMBERSHIP. YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY, RIP  FLAMBE! (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND FOLKS, PETER KING IS NOT  ALONE. ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS, THIS  BOX OF PEACH CRAYOLAS DOWN HERE  --  (LAUGHTER)  ALL OF THEM HAVE V THE BALLS TO SAY THEY DON'T FEEL BOUND BY THE  NO TAX INCREASE PLEDGE. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THE HELL IS  GOING ON, PLEASE WELL FROM  "NATIONAL REVIEW" AND CO-AUTHOR OF "BRAND NEW PARTY, HOW  REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE WORKING  CLASS AND SAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM" REIHAN SALAM. REIHAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (APPLAUSE)  THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE BRAND  NEW PARTY."  LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS GRAND NEW  PARTY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND, IS THIS THE  END OF AN ERA? WHY HAS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  LOST THEIR SPINE?
THE TRUTH IS REPUBLICANS ARE  FACING AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT  POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND A REALLY CHALLENGING FISCAL  ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AND THAT'S  PUT A TON OF PRESSURE ON ADHERING TO THE PLEDGE.
Stephen: ISN'T GROVER  NORQUIST GOING TO BRING DOWN THE  HAMMER ON THESE GUYS COME  MIDTERMS?
IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY BECAUSE  IN SOME PLACES-- FOR EXAMPLE  SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA-- THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE. BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND --.
Stephen: REAL AMERICA.
EXACTLY. BUT, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND --  HEY, I'M FROM BROOKLYN, MY  FRIEND. THAT'S REAL AMERICA, TOO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NO, EXCUSE ME, CALM  DOWN, THAT'S "REAL" AMERICA. IT'S IRONIC PATRIOTISM.
AMERICA HAS CHANGED A N A LOT  OF WAYS OVER 20 YEARS. ONE OF THE BIG CHANGES IS THAT  WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE OVER  THE AGE OF 65. AND REPUBLICANS, LIKE DEMOCRATS,  LIKE PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE AND  SOCIAL SECURITY SO WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT MORE OLD PEOPLE, THOSE  PROGRAMS GET MORE EXPENSIVE AND  THAT MEANS THAT IT'S HARD TO KEEP TAX LEVELS EXACTLY WHERE  THEY HAVE BEEN DURING THE BUSH  YEARS.
Stephen: THAT'S FINE. BUT WHY IS THIS HAPPENING  PUBLICLY. WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE LINDSEY  GRAHAM AND SAXBY CHAMBLISS  SAYING THIS SORT OF THING IN  PUBLIC? IS THERE A NEW POLITICAL  ENVIRONMENT WHERE THESE  CONGRESSMEN, THESE SENATORS WANT TO APPEAR REASONABLE AND  RESPONSIVE?
IT'S MORE THAN JUST APPEARING  REASONABLE AND RESPONSIVE.
Stephen: REALLY. CAN'T WE JUST APPEAR IN WAY AND  THEN LATER GET WHAT WE WANT. WANT? THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO  SKIN A CAT HERE.
YOU MIGHT BE AWARE THAT  REPUBLICANS REALLY LIKE A GUY  CALLED RONALD REAGAN. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.
Stephen: I FEEL A RONALD  REAGAN TATTOO ON THE SMALL OF MY  BACK.
I SHOULD HOPE SO.
I'M GETTING A REAGAN TATTOO  ON MY FACE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU IS  THAT RONALD REAGAN AGREED TO TAX  REFORM THAT LED TO LOWER TAX RATES BUT ALSO HIGHER TAX  REVENUES FROM RICH FOLKS BECAUSE  IT GOT RID OF LOOPHOLES AND  DEDUCTIONS.
Stephen: YOU LOWER TAX RATES,  REVENUES GET HIGHER. I ALREADY SAID THAT EARLIER.
IT'S A COMPLICATED THING.
Stephen: IT'S NOT COMPLICATED  LOWER/HIGHER.
YOU CAN GET REVENUE GAINS  FROM MAKING IT CLEANER AND  FAIRER AND MORE TRANSPARENT AND THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS --.
Stephen: WAIT, SIMPLIFYING  THE TAX CODE, CLOSING LOOPHOLES,  IS THAT NOT RAISING TAXES? ARE THOSE TWO THINGS DIFFERENT?
YOU HAVE HIT ON A VERY TRICKY  AND IMPORTANT ISSUE, STEPHEN,  WHICH IS THAT, YES, THERE'S A WAY TO RAISE AVERAGE TAX RATES  ON HIGH EARNERS WITHOUT RAISING  THE MARGINAL TAX RATE ON HIGH  EARNERS.
Stephen: WOW, I'M INTERESTED  IN WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND YET  IT'S INCREDIBLEBLY BORING AT THE SAME TIME. (LAUGHTER)
FAIR ENOUGH. I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT YOU CAN  INDUSTRIAL A 35% TOP RATE AND  SAY WAIT A SECOND, RICH PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE THE SAME  KIND OF DEDUCTIONS THAT TAKE  TAKE UNDER TODAY'S TAX CODE.
Stephen: BY'M A RICH PERSON,  WHY WOULD I LET DHOPL THAT?
YOU MIGHT DO THAT BECAUSE YOU  MIGHT SEE THAT THAT WOULD BE  BETTER FOR THE COUNTRY AS A  WHOLE.
Stephen: YEAH, BUT --  (LAUGHTER)
DEDUCTIONS REWARD CERTAIN  KINDS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND  PUNISH OTHER KINDS.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT KIND? HOW ABOUT GETTING PAID A LOT OF  MONEY TO DO A T.V. SHOW? WHO GETS REWARDED ON THAT ONE.
LET ME GIVE YOU A FOR  EXAMPLE. MITT ROMNEY, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER  HIM.
Stephen: MITT ROMNEY!
YOUR FAVORITE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BLESS HIS NAME! THE IT WAS RIGHT THERE. IT WAS ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD. I COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT GUY. YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT DUDE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT DUDE?
HE FLOATED THE IDEA OF A  DEDUCTION TAX AT $50,000. NOW, IF YOU HAVE A DEDUCTION TAX  THAT'S THAT HIGH, YOU'RE GOING  TO HIT VERY HIGH EARNERS BUT RAISE A TON OF REVENUE. YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE $800  BILLION OVER TEN YEARS WHICH IS  EXACTLY WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD ASKED FOR AND AGREED TO WITH  SPEAKER BOEHNER BACK IN 2011. NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SAYING HE  WANT MRS. REVENUE. HE WANTS $1.6 TRILLION. BUT THAT'S BIG PROGRESS AND YOU  DON'T HAVE TO RAISE THE TOP RATE  TO GET THERE.
Stephen: OKAY, WHAT HAPPENS  NEXT? DO WE GO OVER THE CLIFF? DOES THIS HAPPEN BEFORE THE  CLIFF OR AFTER THE CLIFF? OR DO WE MAKE THE DEAL AS WE'RE  PLUNGING TOWARDS THE RED SOX.
IF WE GO OVER THE CLIFF THEN  SUDDENLY GROVER NORQUIST'S  PLEDGE BECOMES INOPERATIVE.
OH! SO HE'S POWERLESS. IT'S LIKE SOMEONE GUESSED HIS  NAME AND SENT HIM BACK TO THE  FOREST. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, PLEASE COME BACK WHEN WE  FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. REIHAN SALAM, "THE GRAND NEW
