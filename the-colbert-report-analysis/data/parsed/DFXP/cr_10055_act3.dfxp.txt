Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ESPN ANALYST AND HALL OF FAME WIDE RECEIVER, GOOD LUCK CATCHING MY SOFTBALL QUESTIONS. PLEASE WELCOME CRIS CARTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CHRIS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT. NOW THEN, CHRIS, ALL RIGHT, FOR THE FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW YOUR IMPRESSIVE CV, LET'S GET A FEW THINGS OUT RIGHT OFF THE TOP. LET'S DO MATH. HALL OF FAME WIDE RECEIVER, EIGHT TIME PRO BOWLER, EIGHT STRAIGHT THOUSAND YARD SEASONS, 4200 YARD RECEIVING GAMES, ESPN HAS CALLED YOU ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC PASS RECEIVERS IN NFL HISTORY. YOU'VE ALSO GOT A BOOK IT'S CALLED GOING DEEP WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE NAME OF THAT BOOK ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO SMEARED PETRAEUS AND GOT HIM IN TROUBLE. OKAY. THAT'S A PRETTY RING YOU'VE GOT THERE, A PRETTY RING. SUPER BOWL RING.
IT'S NOT A SUPER BOWL RING.
IT'S A HALL OF FAME RING.
Stephen: A HALL OF FAME RING.
YES.
Stephen: WOW. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DOES THIS MEAN, DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE THE NEXT GREEN LANTERN?
NO, BUT IT DOES MEAN I'M SOMETHING.
Stephen: WOW, THAT IS AMAZING. SO YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREAT WIDE RECEIVERS OF ALL TIME. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A GREAT WIDE RECEIVER. WHAT IS THE SKILL SET.
WELL, THE NUMBER ONE SKILL YOU HAVE TO HAVE, I WOULD PREFER   IS TO HAVE A LARGE SET OF HANDS. BECAUSE-- .
Stephen: LARGE HANDS, HOW BIG ARE THE-- CAN WE? WOW, WOW, YOU ALMOST HAVE A SPARE HAND THERE FOR ME.
YEAH. AND I REALLY LIKE A LARGE THUMB TOO, THAT'S FLEXIBLE BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND THAT OPPOSABLE THUMBS COME IN HANDY FOR ME TOO. OH MY GOD. I TRY TO DO WITHOUT ONE FOR A WHILE. I COULDN'T EVEN TIE MY SHOE LACES.
BUT CHECKING THE FOOTBALL IS IMPORTANT. FIRST THING I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IS A GREAT SET OF HANDS.
Stephen: OKAY, NOW WALK ME THROUGH, WALK ME THROUGH, I GOT A BALL OUT HERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: WALK ME THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS. THE BALL, HERE COMES THE FOOTBALL. YOU GET IT
OKAY.
Stephen: YOU'VE RECEIVED IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. WIDELY, ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAPPENS NOW, BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU HAVE THAT BALL, THE BIGGEST MEN ON THE PLANET WANT TO MAKE YOUR ORGANS COLLAPSE.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND, YOU'VE GOT THE BALL.
THE FIRST THING I DO IS MAKE SURE I SECURE IT AND GET A FINGER ON THE POINT OF IT AND TRY TO GET THIS POINT UNDER MY-- WELL PART OF YOUR ARM IS CALLED A BICEP.
Stephen: I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THOSE.
OKAY.
Stephen: I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THOSE.
SO YOU TRY TO CHUCK IT UP UNDER THERE TO SECURE IT AND PUT AS CLOSE TO YOUR CHIN AS POSSIBLE.
Stephen: OKAY, BECAUSE A GUY IS GOING TO TRY TO GET AWAY FROM YOU IF THEY TACKLE YOU.
WELL, MY GAME WAS TO SCRATCH IT AND IF I COULD TRY TO MAKE THE FIRST GUY MISS, THEN IF NOT, I KNEW A WHOLE BUNCH OF GUYS WERE COMING TO THE SCENE. SO I SAT DOWN ON THE GROUND. ALMOST LIKE IN A POLICE ARREST, YOU KNOW -- OFFICER-- .
Stephen: OFFICER, I AM NOT RESISTING YOU.
WELL, SOMETIMES AS A MINORITY YOU JUST GET ON THE GROUND. YOU JUST GET ON DOWN AND THEN LET THEM CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS. (APPLAUSE)
SO IN THE NFL YOU DO THE SAME THING.
Stephen: YOU'RE LYING ON THE GROUND. YOU'RE SAYING WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG.
JUST TOUCH ME DOWN, LET ME PLAY ANOTHER DOWN.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE PILES. UGLY STUFF?
WELL, HMMMM. DON'T LAY ON THE GROUND A LONG TIME,.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU GET A WEDGEY OR PURPLE NURPLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE NICER THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU. JUST DON'T STAY DOWN A LONG TIME. THAT IS WHY YOU SEE GUYS WHEN THEY GET HIT REAL HARD THEY POP RIGHT UP. OH, THAT DIDN'T HURT, THAT MEANS IT REALLY HURT.
Stephen: THE FASTER THEY GET UP, THE CLOSER THEY ARE TO COLLAPSING.
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN A BIG PILEUP WITH THE BIG GUYS AND SWEATING ON YOU AND EVERYTHING. THEIR HYGIENE IS NOT AS GOOD AS SMALLER RECEIVER, QUARTERBACK TYPES LIKE US.
Stephen: EXACTLY. DO YOU SEE MY TOOL SET OUT THERE THAT I WAS EXERCISING THERE, ON THE FIELD THERE.
I WAS A LITTLE MAD THOUGH.
Stephen: .
WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE ME WITH ISAAC BRUCE, HE HAS BEEN TO FOUR PRO BOWLS, I'VE BEEN TO EIGHT. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR MATH.
Stephen: I HAVE YOU HERE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: HERE WE GO.
HMMMM, NOW SEE, JUST LIKE THAT WITH NO PRACTICE YOU AND I CONNECTING. YOU WENT THROUGH ALL THOSE OUTTAKES,  ISAAC DIDN'T CATCH NONE.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WHAT KIND OF CONNECTION NEED THERE BE BETWEEN A RECEIVER AND A QUARTERBACK? HOW MUCH OF IT IS THE QUARTERBACK BE HOW MUCH IS THE RECEIVER OR IS IT SORT OF SYMBIOTIC.
IT IS SYMBIOTIC. I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH YOUR SENTENCE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE REAL GOOD.
Stephen: SO IT IS LIKE A BASSIST AND A DRUM NEVER A BAND, THEY HAVE TO BE READING EACH OTHER'S MINDS EXCEPT WITH A HIGHER CHANCE OF CONCUSSION.
I PREFER TO USE ANOTHER ANALOGY, MORE LIKE THE SINGER AND SOME TYPE OF MUSIC BEHIND IT BECAUSE THEY PLAY A BIGGER ROLE THAN JUST PEOPLE PLAYING THE MUSIC.
Stephen: SO WHO IS THE SINGER IN THIS.
THE QUARTERBACK.
Stephen: IS THE SINGER.
YEAH, THE QUARTERBACK-- .
Stephen: WHO ARE YOU.
I'M A WIDE RECEIVER, IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.
Stephen: IN THE BAND, IN THE BAND WHO ARE YOU.
IN THE BAND I PLAY EVERYTHING. I'M A WIDE RECEIVER. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T DO. YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
OH, READ THE BOOK, MAN, YOU GOT TO READ THE BOOK. YOU GOT TO READ IT. YOU GOT TO READ THIS BOOK.
Stephen: I WILL, I WILL. (APPLAUSE) SO WHO DO YOU LIKE THIS WEEKEND?
IT'S HARD TO GET AGAINST PAYTON MANNING BUT IN THESE TYPES OF MATCHUP WHERE YOU HAVE THE BEST OFFENSE AGAINST THE BEST DEFENSE, IT'S HAPPENED FOUR TIMES PREVIOUSLY, THE DEFENSE HAS WON THOSE MATCHUPS THREE OR FOUR. SO IT'S HARD TO GO AGAINST THOSE NUMBERS. I LIKE SEATTLE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HALL OF FAME, DO YOU PUT THE HALL OF FAME BEHIND THAT DO YOU WANT TO BET SOMETHING.
I PUT THE HALL OF FAME BEHIND EVERYTHING I CAN DO, AND YOU CHARGE MORE WHEN YOU DO THAT, SO EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LOSING, YOU'RE WINNING.
Stephen: REALLY? THERE'S-- THERE'S A HALL OF FAME SURTAX ON EVERYTHING YOU DO. LISTEN, I WOULD CHARGE --
I WAS NEVER ON THIS SHOW BEFORE. I'M IN THE HALL OF FAME, NOW I'M HERE.
Stephen: WELL, PLEASE COME BACK.
THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOOTBALL HALL OF FAMER, CRIS CARTER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
