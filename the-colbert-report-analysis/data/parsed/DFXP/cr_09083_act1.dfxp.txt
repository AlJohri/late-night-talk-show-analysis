TONIGHT I RETURN TO THE  CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE. SPOILER ALERT:  WE FIX THE  WITHHOLD WORLD. [LAUGHTER] AND THEN IT'S WEEK -- WE FIX THE  WHOLE WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IT'S WEEK TWO. AND MY GUEST AUTHOR CHARLIE  LEDUFF SAYS WE SHOULDN'T GIVE UP  ON DETROIT ALTHOUGH HE SEEMED AWFULLY EAGER TO COME TO NEW  YORK TO TELL ME THAT SCIENTISTS  DISCOVERED A NEW TARANTULA THAT IS THE SIZE OF A HUMAN FACE. CORRECTION, THE SIZE OF A  SCREAMING HUMAN FACE. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS STEPHEN "THE COLBERT REPORT". ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. EVERYBODY. [CHOWD] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN!
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I HAVE TO SAY YOU ARE  EXCITED. I'M EXCITED. I'M STILL COMING DOWN FROM LAST  NIGHT'S INTERVIEW WITH BILL  CLINTON. I MADE PRERECORDED HISTORY WHEN  I GOT THE PRESIDENT TO JOIN  TWITTER AND TWEET USING THE HANDLE PREZ BILLY JEFF. JUST 24 HOURS AS OF 7:00 HE HAS  OVER 88,000 FOLLOWERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOOM! THAT IS CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP,  MR. PRESIDENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE BIG TIME, MY  FRIEND. THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE VISITING  ONE OF YOUR AGRICULTURAL  PROJECTS IN UGANDA THE VILLAGERS ARE GOING TO GO, HEY, YOU ARE  THAT DUDE FROM COLBERT. WE READY FOR THAT. FOLKS YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE  CLINTON FOUNDATION TWITTER FEED  @CLINTONTWEET. I KNOW IT'S NO PERZ BILLY JEFF  BUT IT'S A NONPROFIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR HISTORIC CHAT  IN ST. LOUIS SITE OF THIS  QUEER'S CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE UNIVERSITY WHERE  EVERY YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS  PRESENT PROJECTS THAT MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. FOR INSTANCE, A FEW YEARS AGO  JESSICA MATTHEWS APRIL TENDED  CGIU AND DESIGNED A SOCCER BALL THAT GENERATES ELECTRICITY FOR  PEOPLE IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. AFTER 30 MINUTES OF PLAY IT CAN  POWER A LIGHT FOR THREE HOURS. BEST OF ALL, YOU ONLY HAVE TO  WATCH 30 MINUTES OF SOCCER. [ LAUGHTER ] SO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHO KNOWS WHAT BIG IDEA WILL BE  NEXT? JIM?
I HEADED OVER TO THE CGIU'S  EXCHANGE FAIR TO CHECK OUT SOME  OF THE PROBLEM SOLVING PROJECTS BEING PRESENTED BY THE BRILLIANT  YOUNG MINDS. BUT FIRST I MET UP WITH SOME OLD  FRIENDS.
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE  PROJECTS THAT YOU GOT THESE  YOUNG PEOPLE CREATING TODAY, THIS IS LIKE A SCIENCE FAIR BUT  FOR NOBLE CAUSES, RIGHT?
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD  CHARACTERIZATION.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THE  COMMITMENT PART. WHY NOT JUST SAY WE'RE GOING TO  DO SOMETHING AND IF WE DO, WE DO  AND IF WE DON'T, WE DON'T. OUR HEARTS WERE IN THE RIGHT  PLACE.
BECAUSE TALK IS JUST THAT,  TALK. IF IT TRIGGERS AN ACTION OR IDEA  IT MATTERS.
Stephen: IF I FIND OUT BACK  HERE A FOURTH BATMAN MOVIE IS  RELEASED I'M MISSING OUT. I HAVE TO WATCH IT ON DVD AND  IT'S NOT THE SAME. WHAT IF IT'S IN 3-D.
THEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW  GRATEFUL YOU PEOPLE IN AFRICA ARE  THAM YOU GAVE THEM CLEAN WATER.
Stephen: BUT I MISSED  BATMAN 4.
BUT YOU SAW IT ON DVD.
Stephen: STILL --
WE HAVE $CLOSE TO 500,000 TO  INVEST IN THE BEST COMMITMENT TO  HELP THE STUDENTS TRANSLATE THEIR IDEAS NOT ONLY INTO  COMMITMENTS BUT THE COMMITMENTS  TO REAL ACTION.
Stephen: I WOULD LOVE TO  LOOK AT THE PROJECTS. ALL RIGHT.
SO THIS IS A LOW COST  TECHNOLOGY THAT EXTRACTS THE  WATER FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC AIR.
Stephen: THAT LOOKS A LOT  LIKE A BONG. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THAT IS  JUST A BONG? YOU WERE NOT LIKE IN YOUR DORM  ROOM AND THE RA SAID WHAT ARE  YOU DOING WITH A BONG. IT'S TO CONVERT ATMOSPHERIC  MOISTURE INTO WATER THAT IS AD  FOIBLE? NO, JUST MAKING SURE. COULD IT BE USED AS A BONG?
UM, I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: IT WOULD BE THE  ONLY THING IN THE WORLD THAT  COULD NOT THEN.
WE'RE DEVELOPING A SENSOR TO  INSTALL IN A FOOTBALL HELMET TO  DETECT TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND REPORT?
Stephen: WHY DO WE NEED  THAT? I PLAYED FOOTBALL AS A KID AND I  NEVER SUFFERED ANY BRAIN INJURY.
MOST STUDENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW  THEY RECEIVED A CONCUSSION OVER  THEIR PLAYING TIME.
Stephen: BUT WHY DO WE NEED  THIS BECAUSE I PLAYED FOOTBALL  AS A KID AND NEVER SUFFERED A BRAIN INJURY.
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A  SIGNIFICANT INCREASE.
Stephen: BUT WHY DO WE NEED  THIS, I PLAYED FOOTBALL AS A KID  AND NEVER SUFFERED A BRAIN  INJURY. WHY DO YOU ENFORCE THE  COMMITMENT?
IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH  WITH THE COMMITMENT WE WON'T  INVITE YOU BACK.
Stephen: MY ADVICE FOR THE  KIDS JUST TRYING, BASED ON THAT  SHOOT LOW SO YOU KNOW YOU MAKE YOUR COMMITMENT.
I SEE IT DIFFERENTLY. EVEN IF YOU DON'T ACHIEVE 100%,  IF YOU ACHIEVE 20% YOU MADE A  TANGIBLE DIFFERENCE.
Stephen: IF YOU SAY I  COMMIT TOP END WORLD HUNGER STEP  ONE MAKE YOURSELF A SANDWICH. IF YOU DON'T GO FURTHER AT LEAST  YOU KNOW YOU TOOK THE FIRST STEP  AND YOU ARE INVITED BACK. YOU ARE USING HIP-HOP TO BRIDGE  THE GAP BETWEEN A LOCAL  COMMUNITY THAT HAS HIGH CRIME AND THE SWATHMORE COMMUNITY.
YES.
Stephen: HERE IS WHAT I  DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU SEEM TO CARE. WHAT HAPPENED TO PUTTING YOUR  HANDS IN THE AIR AND WAVING THEM  LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE. WHAT S- THAT NOT PART OF  HIP-HOP.
IT'S SOCIAL CHANGE AND SOCIAL  JUSTICE.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT  PART. I'M FINE WITH CARING I DON'T  KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS  NOW. DO YOU MIND IF I HOP IN HERE AND  GET MY GROOVE ON.
HIT IT.
Stephen: OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'RE FROM COLUMBIA AND WE  GIVE FARMERS TRAINING ACCESS TO  FINANCIAL SERVICES AND USE THEIR CROPS TO PRODUCE A LINE OF READY  TO DRINK TEAZ.
Stephen: YOU ARE PARTNERING  WITH FARMERS IN COLOMBIA TO MOVE  THEIR PRODUCT TO MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES.
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, WOULD YOU  LIKE ME TO CALL THE D.E.A. OR DO  YOU WANT TO TURN YOURSELF IN? TELL ME WHAT YOUR PROJECT IS  HERE?
THERE'S 650 MILLION INDIANS  WHO DEFECATE OUTSIDE EVERY  SINGLE DAY.
Stephen: IS THAT A HOBBY? WHY DO THEY DO THAT?
NO.
Stephen: NATURALLY DO IT  HERE WHY OUTSIDE THERE?
THEY DON'T HAVE TOILETS. WE BUILD COMMUNITY BLOCKS OF  TOILETS AND GENERATE ELECTRICITY  FROM THE METHANE GAS PRODUCED FROM HUMAN WASTE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE WIND  POWER, SOLAR POWER IS POOP POWER  COMING?
I THINK IT IS. WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE IT THE NEXT  BIG THING IN INDIA.
Stephen: WHERE SHOULD  PEOPLE BE MAILING YOU THEIR  POOP?
I HAVE A BUSINESS CARD.
Stephen: AFTER WITNESSING  WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT WAS  DOING I KNEW I NEEDED TO MAKE A WORLD CHANGING COMMITMENT OF MY  OWN. I WAS SO INSPIRED BY THE  COMMITMENT OF THESE YOUNG  PEOPLE, AND IF I HAVE ONLY ONE CRITICISM OF THEIR PROJECTS IT'S  JUST THAT EACH ONE ONLY  ADDRESSES ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME. THAT'S WHY I'M SO PROUD TO  INTRODUCE OUR PROJECT, THIS  MODEL VOLUME CANO. AS YOU CAN SEE THE MODEL VOLCANO  ITSELF IS SAY METO FAR FOR ALL  THE -- METAPHOR FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD. WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS ALL OF  THESE PROBLEMS WITH OUR IDEAS  BECAUSE THIS METAPHOR HAS ANOTHER METAPHOR INSIDE OF IT. IT'S A TWO LITER BOTTLE OF DIET  SAIDA. THAT REPRESENTS THE PLANS AND  INITIATIVES THAT IS GOING TO FIX  THIS STUFF AND I CAN WORK THAT STUFF OUT. THAT'S THE EASY PART. HOW DO I GET MY IDEAS OUT ON TO  THE PROBLEMS? THAT IS MY THIRD METAPHOR. THIS MENTO SYMBOLIZES THE  FUNDINGLY NEED TO MAKE THIS  PROJECT A REALITY, OKAY. MR. PRESIDENT, CHELSEA, LET'S  MAKE A DIFFERENCE. YOU MIGHT WANT TO STEP BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOO! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] NOW I WANT TO GET THIS TO BILL  GATES. OKAY, BECAUSE I NEED THE FUNDING  TO MAKE THIS FULL SCALE BECAUSE  OBVIOUSLY THE LARGER THE VOLCANO, THE MORE PROBLEMS WE  CAN SOLVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT. GREAT. FOR ONE OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE  COULD COME UP WITH AN INITIATIVE  TO CLEAN THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A PRIVATE JET TO CATCH. THANK YOU AGAIN. WHAT A PLEASURE.
VERY NICE STEPHEN.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BYE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IF YOU THINK THE VOLCANO  WAS IMPRESSIVE WAIT UNTIL NEXT  YEAR MY PROJECT IS SOLVING WORLD HUNGER BY REVERSE ENGINEERING  THIS POTATO CROCK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
