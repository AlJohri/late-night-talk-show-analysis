[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, IT'S NO WONDER OBAMA  DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO BOTHER WITH  THE SEQUESTER BECAUSE HE'S TOO BUSY GRABBING OUR GUNS. WELL, THAT PLAN HAS BACKFIRED.
GUN SALES HAVE ABSOLUTELY  EXPLODED.
SALES OF HIGH-CAPACITY  AMMUNITION MAGAZINES ARE SAID TO  BE SOARING.
GUN SALES HAVE SPIKED AROUND  THE COUNTRY LEAVING EMPTY  SHELVES AT SOME GUN SHOPS.
Stephen: YES, THIS GUN RUSH  IS THE KIND OF SHOPPING FRENZY  YOU NORMALLY SEE ON BLACK FRIDAY, ONLY LESS DANGEROUS. [LAUGHTER] IN TEXAS, THEY'VE SOLD SO MANY  GUNS THAT DEMAND FOR CONCEALED  WEAPON PERMITS HAS SKYROCKETED. BUT DON'T WORRY, THE STATE  HAS A PLAN.
THE RUSH IS ON AT THE STATE  CAPITAL TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF  REQUIRED TRAINING HOURS IN TEXAS FROM 10 TO 4. LEADING THE CHARGE STATE  REPRESENATIVE DAN FLYNN. FLYNN SAYS HE WANTS TO TRIM THE  AMOUNT OF TRAINING HOURS FROM 10  TO 4 IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE MUCH OF THE HASSLE AND WASTE.
YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME  TAKING BREAKS. YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME  HEARING STORIES.
Stephen: EXACTLY, WHY WASTE  TIME LISTENING TO DUMB STORIES  ABOUT HOW SO AND SO DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS. WHO CARES? HE'S DEAD NOW. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE REPRESENTATIVE FLYNN  KNOWS HOW VALUABLE HIS  CONSTITUENTS' TIME IS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TRY TO  GET THEIR LICENSE THEY HAVE TO  TAKE A DAY OFF OF WORK, OR THEY HAVE TO TAKE A WHOLE SATURDAY TO  GO DO THIS.
Stephen: YES, YOU CAN'T ASK  PEOPLE TO DEVOTE A WHOLE  SATURDAY TO LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE A DEADLY WEAPON. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S TIME THEY COULD BE  SPENDING ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTING  THEIR FAMILY. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THE GUN-HATERS OUT  THERE DON'T AGREE THAT THE MORE  GUNS WE HAVE THE SAFER WE'LL BE. THEY HAVE THIS CRAZY THEORY THAT  IF THERE ARE FEWER GUNS, FEWER  PEOPLE WILL BE SHOT. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE, OTHER  THAN A HARVARD STUDY FROM THE  1990s COMPILING DATA FROM 26 DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHICH FOUND  THAT "WHERE GUNS ARE MORE  AVAILABLE, THERE ARE MORE HOMICIDES."  COME ON, THAT WAS THE '90s. [LAUGHTER] I'M SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO SOME  SCIENTIST WITH A RACHEL HAIRCUT? [LAUGHTER] LUCKILY, ONE MAN IS OUT TO  PROVE, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THAT  GUNS MAKE US SAFER. KYLE COPLEN, A GRADUATE STUDENT  AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON IS  CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT WHICH WILL DEFINITIVELY SETTLE THIS  DEBATE.
A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT UB LIKE  ANY OTHER. GIVING AWAY GUNS IN HIGH CRIME  AREAS IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE  CRIMES.
FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW  COPLEN'S BEEN ON A MISSION.
WE'RE LOOKING AT DETERRING  CRIME BY EMPOWERING CITIZENS BY  OFFERING UP FREE 20-GAUGE  SHOTGUNS. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO GIVE AWAY  SHOTGUNS TO TEST WHETHER IT  HELPS REDUCE CRIME.
Stephen: THE ORIGINAL PLAN  WAS TO GIVE OUT BATMAN COSTUMES, [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT IN TEXAS, COPYRIGHT LAWS ARE  MUCH STRICTER THAN GUN LAWS. [LAUGHTER] NOW, SOME HAVE QUESTIONED HOW  COPLEN FEELS TESTING OUT HIS  PRO-GUN THEORY SO SOON AFTER THE UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY OF NEWTOWN.
MAKES ME FEEL GREAT. I GET UP EVERY MORNING WITH A  PEP IN MY STEP, GIVING OUT  GUNS. LIVING THE DREAM. IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GIVING OUT  CIGARETTES OR ALCOHOL, WE'RE  GIVING OUT GUNS. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL  IS.
Stephen: YEAH, HE'S NOT  GIVING OUT CIGARETTES OR  ALCOHOL. ONCE YOU HAVE THE GUN, YOU CAN  GET THOSE FOR FREE! [LAUGHTER] BUT SADLY, THIS EXPERIMENT DOES  HAVE ONE FLAW. HE'S GIVEN PEOPLE GUNS ONLY  AFTER THEY PASS A BACKGROUND  CHECK AND COMPLETE A SAFETY AND TACTICAL COURSE.
Stephen: BACKGROUND CHECK? SAFETY COURSE? THAT COULD TAKE UP A WHOLE  SATURDAY. [LAUGHTER] BESIDES, IF HE REALLY WANTS TO  TEST THE IMPACT OF GUNS ON  CRIME, IT'S GOTTA BE A BIGGER  STUDY. FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE GONNA NEED  A CONTROL GROUP WHO ARE GIVEN  PLACEBO GUNS. [LAUGHTER] THEY LOOK IDENTICAL TO REAL  GUNS, BUT SHOOT SUGAR BULLETS,  SO THEY DON'T KILL ANYONE. THEY JUST GIVE YOU TYPE 2  DIABETES. [LAUGHTER] THEN, CREATE ANOTHER  NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S NOTHING BUT  GUNS. I'M TALKING CHOCK-FULL O' GLOCK. [LAUGHTER] GUNS SLIPPED UNDER DOORS LIKE  THAI DELIVERY MENUS AND EVERY  STORE HAS A "TAKE A GUN LEAVE A GUN" TRAY. [LAUGHTER] THEN, IF GUN DEATHS GO DOWN,  WE'LL KNOW DEFINITIVELY IF MORE  GUNS REALLY MAKE US SAFER, AND EVERYBODY GETS TO KEEP THEIR  GUNS. AND IF GUN DEATHS SKYROCKET,  THEN EVERYBODY STILL KEEPS THEIR  GUNS. 'CAUSE WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,  TAKE THEM AWAY?
