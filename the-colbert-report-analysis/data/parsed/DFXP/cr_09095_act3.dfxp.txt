Stephen: HERE WITH  PERFORMANCE OFF THEIR ALBUM THE  HEIST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, McLEMORE AND RYAN LEWIS. ♪ WHEN I WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE  I THOUGHT I WAS GAY ♪♪  AND I KEPT MY ROOM STRAIGHT. I TOLD MY MOM SHE WAS LIKE, BEN,  YOU LIKED GIRLS IN PRE-K. THE STEREOTYPES ALL IN MY HEAD. I REMEMBER DOING THE MATH LIKE,  YEAH, I'M GOOD AT LITTLE LEAGUE. A PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF WHAT IT  ALL MEANS TO LIKE THE SAME SEX. TO HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS, THE  RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVES. YOU CAN BE A PREDISPOSITION. NOW HERE WE GO. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. SOMEHOW WE FAIR A PHRASE BOOK  WRITTEN 3500 YEARS AGO.
I CAN'T CHANGE. EVEN IF I TRY. EVEN IF I WANTED TO.
AND I CAN'T CHANGE EVEN IF I  TRIED. EVEN IF I WANTED TO  ♪ MY LOVE, MY LOVE, SHE KEEPS ME  WARM ♪♪  ♪ IF I WAS GAY, I WOULD THINK HIP HOP HATES ME ♪♪  ♪ HAVE YOU READ THE YOU-TUBE  COMMENTS LATELY ♪♪  MAN THAT'S GAY GETS DROPPED FROM THE DAILY ♪♪  WE'VE BECOME SO NUMB TO WHAT  WE'RE SAYING. OUR CULTURE FOUNDED FROM  OPPRESSION, YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE  ACCEPTANCE FOR 'EM. CALL EACH OTHER FAGGOTS BEHIND  THE KEYS OF A MESSAGE BOARD. A WORD ROOTED IN HATE. YET OUR GENRE STILL IGNORES IT. GAY IS A SYNONYMOUS WITH THE  LESSER IT'S THE SAME HATE THAT'S  CAUSED WARS FROM RELIGION. GENDER TO SKIN COLOR, COMPLEX  ONOF YOUR PIGMENT. THE SAME FIGHT THAT LEAD PEOPLE  TO WALK OUTS AND SIT-INS. THAT HOL HE'LL WATER THAT YOU  SOAK IN HAS BEEN POISONED WHEN  EVERYONE ELSE IS MORE COMFORTABLE REMAINING VOICELESS  RATHER THAN FIGHTING FOR HUMANS  THAT HAVE HAD THEIR RIGHTS  STOLEN. I MIGHT NOT BE THE SAME. BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT. NO FREEDOM 'TIL WE'RE EQUAL. DAMNED RIGHT I SUPPOSER IT. (TROMBONE).
I CAN'T CHANGE EVEN IF I  TRY ♪♪  ♪ EVEN IF I WANTED TO ♪♪  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE ♪♪ ♪ KEEPS ME WARM ♪♪  ♪ KEEPS ME WARM ♪♪  ♪ IT KEEPS ME WARM ♪♪
WE PRESS PLAY. DON'T PRESS PAUSE. PROGRESS MUCH ON. WITH A VEIL OVER OUR EYES WE  TURN OUR BACK ON THE CAUSE 'TIL  THE DAY THAT MY UNCLES CAN BE UNITED BY LAW KIDS ARE WALKING  AROUND THE HALLWAY PLAGUED BY  PAIN IN THEIR HEART A WORLD SO HATEFUL SOMEONE WOULD RATHER DIE  THAN BE WHO THEY ARE. A CERTIFICATE ON PAPER ISN'T  GOING TO SOLVE IT ALL BULL IT'S  A DAMNED GOOD PLACE TO START. NO LAW'S GOING TO CHANGE US. WE HAVE TO CHANGE US. WHATEVER GOD YOU BELIEVE IN, WE  COME FROM THE SAME ONE. STRIP AWAY THE FEAR. UNDERNEATH IT'S ALL THE SAME  LOVE. ABOUT TIME THAT WE RAISED UP. ♪ I CAN'T CHANGE EVEN IF I  TRIED ♪♪  ♪ EVEN IF I WANTED TO ♪♪  ♪ I CAN'T CHANGE ♪♪ ♪ EVEN IF I TRIED ♪♪  ♪ EVEN IF I WANTED TO ♪♪  PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER. ♪ IT KEEPS ME WARM ♪♪  ♪ IT KEEPS ME WARM ♪♪  ♪ IT KEEPS ME WARM ♪♪  LOVE IS PATIENT.

I'M NOT CRYIN' ON SUNDAYS. I'M NOT CRYING ON SUNDAYS. I'M NOT CRYIN' ON SUNDAYS. I'M NOT CRYIN' ON SUNDAYS. I'M NOT CRYIN' ON SUNDAYS. I'M NOT CRYING ON SUN SUNS. I'M NOT CRYING ON SUNDAYS.
LOVE IS PATIENT. LOVE IS KIND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
