[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: , RIGHT OVER HERE. WHY NOT? WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NOW, NATION, ANYONE WOULD KNOWS  ME KNOWS I LOVE ME SOME  HIP-TO-THE-HOP RAPPITY RAP RAP. AND THERE'S NO GREATER RAPPER  ALIVE THAN KANYE WEST. AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO NONE  OTHER THAN RENOWN RAP EXPERT  KANYE WEST. I MEAN THIS GUY IS DROPPING  SCIENCE LIKE AN UNDERFUNDED  SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT YEEZY'S LATEST WORK OF  YEENIUS ISN'T MUSIC, FOLKS. IT'S FASHION. YEEMMY?
CAN YEAH HAS A NEW BABY, NEW  ALBUM AND NEW CLOTHES. THE FASHION FORWARD RAPPER HAS  COLLABORATED WITH FRENCH BRAND  A.P.C. FOR A CAPSULE COLLECTION. THE A.P.C. CAN YEAH COLLECTION  CONSISTS OF A JEAN, A HOODIE AND  A T-SHIRT
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. KANYE WEST HAS A CLOTHING LINE  BUT NOT SHOES AND HANDBAGS. HE LEAVES THAT TO HIS SISTER,  NINE. IT'S ALL GREAT. BUT MY FAVORITE HAS GOT TO BE  THIS $120 WHITE T-SHIRT MADE OF  100% COTTON WITH RIBBING AT THE NECKLINE AND SHORT SLEEVES. OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO  GET ANY PIT STAINS ON SOMETHING  THIS PRICEY SO BE SURE TO WEAR AN UNDERSHIRT. NOW, FOLKS, THIS MAY LOOK LIKE A  PLAIN WHITE T-SHIRT BUT IT'S  NOT, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS NAME "THE HIP HOP T-SHIRT."  I BELIEVE THE SHIRT IS A  COLLABORATION BY FRUIT,  FEATURING "THE LOOM." NOW BEFORE YOU GO OUT TO BUY IT,  THE HIP HOP T-SHIRT HAS SOLD  OUT. BUT IF YOU WANT TO BUY YOUR OWN  PIECE OF HIP-HOP STREET CRED,  YOU'RE IN LUCK. BECAUSE TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO  OFFER MY PREMIERE LINE OF HIP-OP  COUTURE. TUBE SOCKS. ALL RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MADE IN THE CHI-NIZZLE. ALL MY HOMES IN THE SWEAT SHOP  SAY NOTHING. GET BACK TO WORK. $75. AND THAT'S NOT ALL, FOLKS. THIS WEEKEND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  WANT TO MISS MY HIP HOP YARD  SALE. COME ON DOWN IF YOU WANT, LET'S  SEE, I'VE GOT A BOX OF HIP HOP  USED V.H.S. TAPES. I'VE ALSO GOT THIS SPATULA WITH  A LITTLE HIP HOP BURN ON THE  HANDLE. FROM WHEN I WAS MAKING PANCAKES. I MEAN, NEW FLAPJACK CITIES. NOT TO MENTION I'VE GOT THESE  HIP HOP COLORING BOOKS.
