TONIGHT BIG NEWS FROM THE STECK WORLD, WILL WE FINALLY LEARN THE PURPOSE OF THE NAP. THEN OBAMA WANTS EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE. THAT MAKES NO SENSE. WHY WOULD I STARE AT A PAN'S CHEST. AND MY GUEST FACEBOOK COO SHERYL SANDBERG HAS A NEW BOOK CALLED LEAN IN FOR GRADUATES. TAKE THAT, PARENTS, WHO TOLD THEM TO STAND UP STRAIGHT. HILLARY CLINTON ANNOUNCED SHE MAY RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS SHOCKED SINCE MITT ROMNEY ANNOUNCED HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M SORRY, NATION, I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, FOLKS. I JUST HAVE TO-- SORRY, FOLKS. I'LL DO IT IN A MOMENT. I JUST--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M JUST DESPERATELY TRYING TO SECURE MY DATA, FOLKS, YOU SEE, LIKE YOU. I'M IN A DEEP PANIC BECAUSE WE ARE FACING THE GREATEST SECURITY BRIEF IN INTERNET HISTORY.
A MAJOR SECURITY THREAT MAKING LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO USE THE INTERNET A NEW BUG AFFECTING TWO-THIRDS OF ALL MAJOR WEB SITES. AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO STEAL THEIR PERSONAL DATA, CALLED HEART BLEED.
IT WAS UNDISCOVERED FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS AND ANYTHING SENT DURING THAT TIME HAS POTENTIALLY BEEN COMPROMISED DURING THAT TIME.
YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS NOT COMPROMISED UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE TECHIES WHO USE THE INTERNET IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.
SO YOU ARE TOTALLY SAYING TED KACZYNSKI AND OLD JAPANESE HER HIT LIVING IN A JUNGLE THINKING WORLD WAR II IS STILL GOING ON. YOU SEE, THE BUG, HEART BLEED POTENTIALLY EXPOSES PASSWORDS, CREDIT-CARD NUMBERS AND THE CONTENTS OF YOUR E-MAILS. CALL ME NAIVE BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE KIND OF PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT WAS BETWEEN ME AND THE NSA. FOLKS, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. THE INTERNET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A LAWLESS FRONTIER WHERE ALL OF HUMANNITIES DESIRES AN VICES PERJURIED INTO A ROYALLY COLLECTED ID HELD IN CHECK BY A BARELY REGULATED TECHNICAL ABSTRACTIONS I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW DID THAT GET OUT OF CONTROL? AND WE'RE ALL POTENTIAL VICTIMS HERE. I COULD HAVE BEEN SCAMMED BY ANY ONE OF MY MOST TRUSTED SITES. REAL GULL BARRIAN IVORY.COM. NONDESCRIPT POWDER.ORG EVEN PURE SILVER MORTGAGE TEAM.HAITI.BIZ OR THE SITE WHERE I FOUND ALL THOSE, YAHOO! MAIL. (LAUGHTER) BUT NATION, YOU CAN STILL PROTECTION YOUR-- PROTECT YOURSELFS FROM HEART BLEED WITH THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK.
SECURITY EXPERTS SAY INTERNET USERS SHOULD CHANGE ALL OF THEIR PASSWORDS.
OH, ALREADY ON IT. I DON'T WANT TO BRAG BUT MY SECURITY GUY E-MAILED ME AS SOON AS THIS BROKE. NOT ONLY IS HE A TECH EXPERT HE'S ALSO THE RIGHTFUL HEIR TO A OIL FORTUNE. TOLD ME I NEEDED AN EXTRA SECURE PASSWORD. HE SUGGESTED THE FIRST 16 DIGITS OF MY CREDIT CARD FOLLOWED BY THE LAST NINE DIGITS OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. THERE YOU GO. AND NOW TO DOUBLE THE ENCRYPTION BY A TACHING A HIGH RESOLUTION SCAN OF MY SIGNATURE, AND THE OUTLINE OF MY HOUSE KEY. THERE YOU GO. I WILL SLEEP WELL TONIGHT. OF COURSE, HEART BLEED ISN'T THE ONLY SCANDAL IN THE WORLD OF TECH. THERE IS ALSO THE BLEEDSING HEARTS BECAUSE THE LEFT WING LOUD MOUTHS HAVE NOW DESTROYED THE REPUTATION OF MY GOOD FRIEND TECH PIONEER BRENDAN EICH. I LIKE EICH. IN FACT I HAVE BEEN CALLED SOMETHING OF AN EICHMAN. YOU PROBABLY KNOW EICH AS THE CREATOR OF JAVASCRIPT UNLESS YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. TWO WEEKS AGO-- TWO WEEKS AGO BRENDAN EICH WAS NAMED C.E.O. OF MOZILLA KNOWN FOR HIS OPEN SOURCE WEB BROWSER FIREFOX. NO, I DON'T WANT TO UPDATE RIGHT NOW. I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SHOW. JIMMY, PLEASE. THANK YOU, JIM. AS SOON AS EICH GOT THE JOB A REPORT SURFACED THAT IN 2008 HE DONATED 1,000 TO SUPPORT A CALIFORNIA PROP 8 WHICH OUTLAWED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. SO GAY INTERNET ACTIVISTS FOR LGBTHTTP GOT MORE THAN 70,000 PEOPLE TO SIGN A PETITION ASKING EICH TO RESIGN AND THE DATING SERVICE OK-CUPID BLOCKED FIREFOX ON ITS WEB SITE LEAVING MANY OF ITS USERS TO TEXT GOOGLE CHROME, WHAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FACED WITH IN BOY ON BOYCOTT, EICH RESIGNED BECAUSE WHEN GAY PEOPLE WANT SOMEONE TO RESIGN, HE'S OUT IN A WEEK. BUT WHEN I WANT SOMEONE TO RESIGN IT'S ALWAYS OH, I WAS ELECTED OR I'M THE VOICE OF GOD, OR SIR, FOR THE LAST TIME ONLY MEMBERS OF THE GEEK SQUAD ARE ALLOWED BACK HERE. THANKFULLY, MY GOOD FRIEND AT FOX NEWS BLEW THIS STORY INTO PROPORTION.
WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY AFRAID.
WHY DOES A GUY HAVE TO LEAVE A DREAM JOB FOR VOICING HIS OPINION.
SO MUCH FOR FREE SPEECH.
SOME OF FOR FREE SPEECH.
SO. NOR TOLERANCE.
THEY SAY THEY ARE TOLERANCE RANT BUT THEY ARE NOT.
THEY SAY TOTALITARIAN DISCOURSE AND IT SHOWS A LEVEL INTOLERANCE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY, IT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE.
THIS IS THE IRONY, ISN'T IT. PEOPLE PUNISHING SOMEONE IN THE NAME OF TOLERANCE. IT COMES FROM A FASCIST SOCIETY. IT IS A SHAME THAT IT IS THE GAY COMMUNITY, AT LEAST THE GAY ESTABLISHMENT THAT IS LEARNING HOW TO GOOSESTEP AT THIS POINT.
YES, THE GAYS ARE GOOSESTEPPING. WE ALL REMEMBER WHEN HITLER CIRCULATED THAT PETITION ASKING FOR POLAND TO RESIGN AFTER IT PREVENTED HIM FROM MARRYING EVAN BRAUN. FOLKS, A MAN HAS JUST LOST HIS JOB FOR TRYING TO BAN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. MEANWHILE, THERE ARE ONLY 29 STATES LEFT WHERE I CAN STILL FIRE SOMEONE FOR BEING GAY. I MEAN I HAD TO TAKE ALL MY GAY EMPLOYEES ON A BUSINESS TRIP TO ALABAMA JUST TO CAN THEM. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I WILL BE FORCED INTO THE CLOSET FOR MY BELIEFS. EVERY WHERE I GO PEOPLE ASSUME I'M OKAY WITH GAY MARRIAGE BUT I WILL KNOW IN MY HEART THAT THAT IS NOT WHO I AM. AND NO ONE CAN EVER MAKE ME BELIEVE IT GETS BETTER, BECAUSE FRANKLY, THINGS ARE PRETTY GREAT FOR ME RIGHT NOW. HERE TO PERSECUTE ME FURTHER IS BLOGGER, FOUNDER OF THE DISH AND A MAN WHO IS A GAY, SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY IN FAVOURING OF FIRING BRENDAN EICH. MR. ANDREW SULLIVAN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. OKAY, ANDREW, LET'S HAVE TELEPHONE. YOUR SIDE WON, LET'S HAVE YOUR END ZONE DACHBLTS YOU GOT THE SCALP OF BRENDAN EICH, GO?
WELL, FORGIVE ME, I'M NOT GOING QUITE GLOCHLT I ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY ON GAY RIGHTS BECAUSE OPEN, TOLERANCE, PERSUADED PEOPLE BY REASON AND HAVEN'T JUMPED DOWN EVERYBODY'S VOTES WHO DISAGREED WITH US AND CALL THEM A BIGOT AND GET THEM FIRED. I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF TEN OR AND THAT IMPULSE SO PUNISH PEOPLE THE THINGS THAT THEY SER SIN VEERLY BELIEVE.  -- SINCERELY BELIEVE. LAUGH LATCH LAUGH--  (LAUGHTER)
YOU HAVE LOST ME HERE, YOU'VE LOST ME HERE FOR A SECOND IS THAT SOME KIND OF GAY CODE THAT I'M TO THE GETTING? OR SOMETHING? HOW YOU CAN-- HOW YOU CANNOT, HOW YOU CAN-- YOU'RE GAY MARRIED.
I AM VERY GAY MARRIED.
THAT GUY DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO BE GAY MARRIED AND YOU STILL THINK PEOPLE WITHOUT SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE SHOULD STILL DO BUSINESS WITH HIM.
NOT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO. BUT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO RESIGN, WHEN PEOPLE START LOSING THEIR JOBS, WHEN PEOPLE IN THE WORKPLACE ESPECIALLY ARE UNDER THREAT, WILL FEEL THREATENED, THE THINGS THEY DO COMPLETELY OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE, THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS, IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU ACTUALLY FIRED SOMEONE FOR POLITICAL VIEW YOU DISAPPROVED OF, IT WOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING THIS KIND OF POLITICAL WARFARE INTO THE WORKPLACE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE WHO SINCERELY, PASSIONATELY YOU DISAGREE WITH.
NO, WE DON'T, NO, NO (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO! LOOK, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WORSE THAN MAKE MY AUDIENCE GAY, YOU'VE MADE THEM REASONABLE. OKAY. BUT LISTEN, I LIVE MY LIFE BY A POLICY, SOMEONE DISAGREED WITH ME, I PUT MY HEAD ON A SPIKE AND I SAY THIS WAS MY ENEMY. NOW I HAVE HIS HEAD. ISN'T THAT THE WAY YOU GUYS GOT YOUR GAY RIGHTS. ARIZONA INTRODUCES SOME LAW ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE, BOYCOTT ARIZONA. COME ON, YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU GUYS DIDN'T USE REAL MUSCLE.
NO, TOTALLY BOYCOTTS AND SOCIAL PRESSURE ARE FINE. WHERE I DRAW THE LINE IS WHEN WE START TARGETING INDIVIDUALS FOR PUNISHMENT OR CALLING THEM HERETIC OR BIGOTS OR HATERS WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE CHANCE TO REALLY EXPLAIN THEMSELVES, TO TALK AND ASSESS THEY ARE REASONABLE HUMAN BEINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE COME TO THIS CONCLUSION FOR GOOD REASON. NOW LOOK, I THINK WE HAVE ACTUALLY PERSUADE PEOPLE, WE HAVE MADE ARGUMENTS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT EVERYBODY TODAY DIDN'T SUPPORT SAME SEX MARRIAGE IS A HATEFUL BIGOT. I DON'T. I THINK A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY HAVE CHANGED THEIR MIND WERE THEY ALL BIGOTS TEN YEARS AGO. I THINK BARACK OBAMA CHANGED HIS MIND. WAS HE A BIGOT IN 2009. OF COURSE NOT.
HE'S A BIGOT NOW. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT, I, I-- I MAY-- I MAY NOT AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAY BUT I WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH FOR MY RIGHT TO HAVE YOU FIRED FOR SAYING IT. ANDREW, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANDREW SULLIVAN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
