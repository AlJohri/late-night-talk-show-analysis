Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, WELCOME BACK TO  STEPHEFT COLBCHELLA '01, THE SONG OF THE SUMMER OF THE  CENTURY FEATURING THE ARTISTS  FORMERLY BOOKED AS DAFT PUNK. NOW THEY'RE NOT HERE TONIGHT,  AND I HAVE ACCEPTED A LOT OF  MONEY FROM OUR COLBCHELLA SPONSOR HYUNDAI. SO NOT DELIVERING THE SONG OF  THE SUMMER IS A REAL KICK IN MY  BALLS BROUGHT TO YOU BY HYUNDAI. NOW, FOLKS THIS COULD NOT BE A  BIGGER DISASTER IF SOMEONE HAD  PLANNED IT. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. THIS IS MTV NETWORKS. OF COURSE, I'VE BEN DAFT PUNKED. WHERE IS HE? ASHTON, I KNOW YOU'RE HERE. WHERE IS ASHTON? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BABY!
