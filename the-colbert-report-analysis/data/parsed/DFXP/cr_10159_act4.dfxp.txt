Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT IF YOU ENJOYED MY INTERVIEW WITH BILL COSBY TONIGHT, GET IN LINE. AND TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MR. COSBY, GO TO YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY AND CHECK OUT COSBY, HIS LIFE AND TIMES BY MARK WHITAKER. AN WHEN THEY TELL YOU THEY DON'T HAVE IT YET, GO OUT AND BUY IT, YOU CHEAP SKATE. GOOD NIGHT.
