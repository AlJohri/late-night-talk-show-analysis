( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, BEFORE THE  COMMERCIAL BREAK, I TOLD YOU HOW  AN ACADEMIC PAPER BY HARVARD ECONOMIST ROGOFF AND REINHART  WHICH CONSERVATIVES WORLDWIDE  ARE USING TO ARGUE FOR AUSTERITY WAS RECENTLY REFUTED BY A U-MASS  GRAD STUDENT JUST BECAUSE IT HAD  A FEW SIMPLE SPREADSHEET ERRORS AND A COUPLE OF LITTLE  STAGGERING OMISSIONS THAT MADE  IT SLIGHTLY FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. EVEN WORSE NONE OF THEIR PIE  CHARTS CONTAINED REAL PIE. HERE TO DEFEND HIS ATTACK THE  GRAD STUDENT WHO HAS FISCAL  CONSERVATIVES' PANTIES IN AN ECONOMIC BUNCH. PLEASE WELCOME THOMAS HERNDON. MR. HERNDON, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE. ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, WHY DID YOU DO  THIS? WHO WAS BEHIND YOU? GEORGE SOROS, NANCY PELOSI. WHO? WHO ASSIGNED YOU TO DO THIS?
ACTUALLY IT WAS MY PROFESSORS  IN MY CLASS. IT WAS THE TERM PAPER FOR OUR  PROJECT. WE HAD TO REPLICATE SOMEONE  ELSE'S PAPER AND LEARN ALL THE  TECHNIQUES IN IT.
Stephen: YOU WENT TO  REPLICATE THESE FINDINGS AND  THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, YOU KNOW, I TRIED TO  BUILD THE DATA MYSELF FROM ALL  THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES BUT I JUST COULDN'T REPLICATE  THEIR NEGATIVE AVERAGE.
Stephen: DID YOU START  RECALCULATING?
I DID. IT TOOK A COUPLE OF EMAILS. THEY WERE POLITE ENOUGH TO GIVE  ME THEIR SPREADSHEET. ONCE I GOT THE SPREADSHEET, YOU  KNOW, I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE  ERROR PRETTY QUICKLY.
Stephen: YES, YES. WELL, IT WAS FINE WITH THEM FOR  YOU TO HAVE THE SPREADSHEET.
THEY TOLD ME THAT FEEL FREE  TO LIKE PUBLISH WHATEVER RESULTS  I HAD.
Stephen: THEN YOU HAD THE  BALLS TO ACTUALLY PUBLISH  WHATEVER RESULTS YOU HAD.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT  WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE  AND REALLY UPON STORY SO I WANTED THE PROFESSION TO HEAR  ABOUT IT.
Stephen: WHEN YOU FIRST SAW  THESE, YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT  I'VE GOT TO BE WRONG.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I  THOUGHT. I COULDN'T REALLY BELIEVE MY  EYES. SO I ASKED MY GIRLFRIEND WHO IS  ALSO A RESEARCHER IN SOCIOLOGY  TO LOOK AT THE SPREADSHEET WITH  ME.
Stephen: WHY ASK HER? HE'S HAD A LOT OF FISCAL  TRAINING AS WELL. SHE'S REALLY SHARP AND PAYS A  LOT OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
Stephen: DID SHE LEARN EXCEL  SPREADSHEET?
THAT'S PRETTY STANDARD. Stephen: SEEMS LIKE THAT  WOULD HELP. OKAY. SO YOU HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND TO  PEER-REVIEW YOUR WORK. AND THEN TAKE IT TO PROFESSORS. THEY SAID, YEAH, YEAH, WE'LL  PUBLISH THIS. HERE'S MY WORRY ABOUT YOU, YOUNG  MAN. YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE UPSET  SOME PEOPLE IN THE AUSTERITY  CROWD. OKAY. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT HAD.
IT'S TRUE. Stephen: OKAY. THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND  SOMETIMES VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE  WHO ARE USING THE ARGUMENT OF JEKYLL AND HYDE OVER THERE TO,  YOU KNOW, MAKE AUSTERITY  MEASURES ALL OVER THE WORLD. DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE STARTING  YOUR CAR FOR YOU RIGHT NOW?
I'M REALLY LUCKY THAT THE  UNIVERSITY HAS HELPED ME TAKE  CARE OF ME AND SPOAR ME THROUGH THE WHOLE MEDIA PROCESS. THEY TAKE CARE OF ME REALLY  WELL.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT  AUSTERITY IS THE RIGHT THING TO  DO?
NO. I THINK AUSTERITY AT THIS TIME  IS LARGELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.
Stephen: BUT THEY'RE ALREADY  USING IT ALL OVER EUROPE. THEY LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT THEY  HAVE CELEBRATIONS IN THE  STREETS. SOMETIMES WITH FIRE AND  EVERYTHING.
IT'S TRUE. ONE OF THE THINGS IS, AS I'VE  BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF THE  MEDIA ACROSS THE WORLD THEY'VE GIVEN ME PRETTY HEART BREAKING  STORIES ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON  IN EUROPE. I'VE ALSO SEEN THE EFFECTS OF IT  IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL.
Stephen: RIGHT. WE HAVE TO KEEP CUTTING THE  GOVERNMENT BUDGET AND LAYING OFF  PEOPLE UNTIL THOSE PEOPLE GET  JOBS.
THAT SEEM TO BE THE ARGUMENT. Stephen: IT IS THE ARGUMENT. IT DOESN'T SEEM PLAUSIBLE TO  ME. I TEND TO THINK THAT IF WE LAY  OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE THEN IT'S  NOT REALLY GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY. THEN THOSE PEOPLE CAN'T GO OUT  AND PARTICIPATE AND BUY THINGS. THAT'S REALLY BAD FOR BUSINESSES  AS WELL.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE JUST GOING  TO USE COMPLICATED ECONOMIC  JARGON I CAN'T UNDERSTAND, MR. HERNDON, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. HERE'S THE PAPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
