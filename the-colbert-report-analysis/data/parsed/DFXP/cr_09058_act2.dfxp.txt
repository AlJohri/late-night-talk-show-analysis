Stephen: WELCOME BACK. NATION, I TRY TO STAY POSITIVE,  BUT FACTS ARE FACTS. I KNOW IT, YOU KNOW IT. AMERICAN VALUES ARE IN THE  CRAPPER. CASE IN POINT, I JUST SAID  CRAPPER ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. [LAUGHTER] JIMMY, DID WE BLEEP THAT?
NO, WE DIDN'T.
Stephen: GODDAMMIT! [LAUGHTER] AND NOW IT APPEARS THAT AMERICA  HAS HIT ROCK BOTTOM WITH A NEW  APP ON FACEBOOK CALLED "BANG WITH FRIENDS" THAT LETS YOU  PRIVATELY NOMINATE THOSE IN YOUR  FRIENDS NETWORK YOU WANT TO HOOK UP WITH. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT  SEX, IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO BE  NOMINATED. [LAUGHTER] NOW THE FRIENDS DON'T KNOW  YOU'VE NOMINATED THEM UNLESS  THEY ALSO NOMINATE YOU, IN WHICH CASE, THE APP ALERTS YOU BOTH. THEN, IT'S OFF TO MEET FOR,  LET'S SAY, COFFEE. [LAUGHTER] I BELIEVE THAT'S CALLED STEAMING  THE MILK. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, IT'S DISGUSTING AND  PERILOUS. WHEN I'M ON FACEBOOK, I'M  CONSTANTLY CHECKING OUT MY  FRIENDS' ADORABLE CAT PICTURES. ONE WRONG CLICK, NEXT THING I  KNOW I'M WAKING UP IN BED WITH  SOME STRANGE CALICO, COUGHING UP  HAIRBALLS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RELATIONSHIPS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO  START THIS WAY. WHERE'S THE MYSTERY? WHERE'S THE ROMANCE? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD DAYS  WHEN YOU WOULD WOO SOMEONE BY  WAITING UNTIL THE BARTENDER YELLED "LAST CALL" AND THEN  SHAMBLING INTO A CAB WITH THE  FIRST WARM BODY THAT DIDN'T ACTIVELY RESIST YOU. [LAUGHTER] GET IT TOGETHER, NATION. FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW, DO YOU  REALLY WANT TO TELL YOUR  GRANDKIDS YOU MET NANA USING A FACEBOOK APP? NO, YOU WANT TO SHOW THEM THE  HEARTFELT LOVE LETTER YOU WROTE  TO HER ONE NIGHT AT 3:00 AM. [LAUGHTER] FOLLOWED BY AN INSTAGRAM OF YOUR  JUNK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S THE SEPIA THAT MAKES IT SO  ROMANTIC. GOD, I HOPE THAT'S SEPIA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
