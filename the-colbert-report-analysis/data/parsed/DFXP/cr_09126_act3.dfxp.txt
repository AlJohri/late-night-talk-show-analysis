[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  ABOUT BODY IMAGE. I'D READ IT IF IT WERE A LITTLE  THINNER. PLEASE WELCOME KJERSTIN GRUYS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK SO MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME. Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF Y'S AND J's  IN THERE. KJERSTIN GRUYS I'VE GOT THAT  CORRECTLY.
CORRECT. Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING ON  A SHOW.
THANK YOU. Stephen: YOU ARE A FORMER  FASHION INDUSTRY. YOU ARE A CANDIDATE WHERE YOU  TEACH. YOUR BOOK IS CALLED MIRROR,  MIRROR OFF THE WALL. HOW I LEARNED TO LOVE MY BODY BY  NOT LOOKING AT IT FOR A YEAR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU DID NOT LOOK INTO A MIRROR  FOR A YEAR?
AND OTHER AFFECTED SURFACES  WERE OUT ALSO.
Stephen: LIKE THE TOASTER? THE TOASTER THE, THE KNIFE AT  RESTAURANTS.
Stephen: DID YOU DO THAT  BEFORE?
I DIDN'T REALIZE. Stephen: WERE YOU ALWAYS  CHECKING YOURSELF OUT IN THE  KNIFE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A REAL  PROBLEM. BUT YOU WERE?
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS UNTIL  I COULDN'T ANYMORE. WHEN I DIDN'T WANT TO. THEN SUDDENLY MIRRORS WERE  EVERYWHERE.
Stephen: COULD YOU EVEN LOOK  DOWN AT YOURSELF OR DID YOU HAVE  TO WEAR ONE OF THOSE DOG COLLARS LIKE A CHAIN?
I LOOKED DOWN AT MYSELF ALL  THE TIME. TO SEE IF I HAD CAT HAIR ON ME,  ET CETERA.
Stephen: DID YOU? USUALLY. Stephen: WHY DID YOU DO THIS? WHY PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE  AGONY OF NOT LOOKING AT  YOURSELF.
IT WASN'T AGONY. Stephen: IT WASN'T? BUT YOU'RE A GOOD LOOKING  PERSON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I  DIDN'T ALWAYS FEEL THAT WAY. LIKE A LOT OF WOMEN, I COMPLETED  MY LOOKS WITH MY ENTIRE SENSE OF  SELF.
Stephen: AND THAT IS WRONG  BECAUSE...
IT IS WRONG BECAUSE... Stephen: I'M JUST CURIOUS. ... WE HAVE MANY MORE THINGS  TO OFFER THE WORLD AND TO  OURSELVES. I THINK THAT EVERYONE IS  BEAUTIFUL IN THEIR OWN WAY.
Stephen: OKAY, NO. INCLUDING... (LAUGHING). [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I DON'T KNOW... Stephen: SOME PEOPLE ARE  REALLY HOT. I MEAN, WHY CAN'T PEOPLE WHO ARE  REALLY HOT, WHO LOOK IN THE  MIRROR AND GO, THAT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU  LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND WENT  THIS OR THAT, IRTO CHANGE THIS. IF YOU LOOKED IN AND WENT,  LOOKING GOOD, BUDDY, WHAT'S  WRONG WITH THAT?
I THINK IT'S GREAT TO HAVE  SELF-ESTEEM AND A HEALTHY BODY  IMAGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO KEEP APPEARANCE IN  PERSPECTIVE.
Stephen: THE CRAZIEST THING  IS IS YOU GOT MARRIED DURING  THIS YEAR WITHOUT MIRRORS.
I DID. Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT LIKE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S DAREDEVIL.
THE WEDDING AND PREPARING FOR  THE WEDDING WAS THE REASON I HAD  TO DO THIS PROJECT. I WAS REALLY GETTING SUCKED INTO  THE INDUSTRY, THE WEDDING  INDUSTRY TELLING ME THAT, YOU  KNOW,...
Stephen: YOUR MOST BEAUTIFUL  DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF MY LIFE  AND THAT THE WEDDING WAS REALLY  ABOUT WHAT I LOOKED LIKE AND NOT ABOUT MY MARRIAGE AND ALL MY  FRIENDS AND FAMILY. AND I WAS FEELING ALARMED. MY RESEARCH AT U.C.L.A. IS ABOUT  BODY IMAGE AND WOMEN'S ISSUES. I FELT KIND OF LIKE A BODY IMAGE  EXPERT WITH A BODY IMAGE PROBLEM  AND I WANTED TO CHANGE THAT.
Stephen: DID YOU THINK YOU  HAD A PROBLEM? AS I SAID YOU'RE A PERFECTLY  ATTRACTIVE PERSON. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH KEEPING  TRACK OF YOUR WEIGHT AND YOUR  HAIR AND YOUR SKIN AND THAT THING YOU HAVE UP THERE?
I THINK IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL... Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT THING  ON YOUR FACE I'M TALKING'?
I HAVE NO IDEA BUT I'M GOING  TO TRUST YOU.
Stephen: THAT THING YOU'VE  GOT. THE THING YOU WOULD CHANGE. THE ONE THING YOU WOULD CHANGE  ABOUT YOUR FACE. WE ALL NOTICED IT WHEN YOU SAT  DOWN.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY THINK THAT  EVERY PERSON HAS... A POINT. IF WE ALL TOOK A STEP BACK AND  THOUGHT, AM I SPENDING THE RIGHT  AMOUNT OF TIME, MONEY, ENERGY, AND BRAIN POWER OR MAYBE A  LITTLE TOO MUCH? THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE  DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE. I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE  QUESTION TO ASK.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THERE  CAN BE, YOU KNOW, YOU SAY  EVERYONE HAS GOT THE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT TO FEEL ABOUT THEMSELVES  THE WAY THEY FEEL ABOUT  THEMSELVES. CAN BEING TOO CONFIDENT ABOUT  YOUR LOOKS BE A BAD THING?
I THINK IT CAN ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW, LOOKS CHANGE OUR  LIVES. THAT'S NATURAL.
Stephen: NOT ALWAYS. CAN WE SHOW A PICTURE PLEASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YOU KNOW, I LIKE THAT HE HAS  ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.
Stephen: HE IS WEARING  ROSE-COLORD GLASSES. WHEN YOU FINALLY LOOKED IN THE  MIRROR, WHAT DID YOU THINK? WHO WAS THAT STRANGER IN MY  BATHROOM?
HONESTLY, I FELT LIKE I WAS  SEEING AN OLD FRIEND THAT I  HADN'T SEEN IN A YEAR. IT WAS WONDERFUL.
Stephen: DID SHE SAY ANYTHING  BACK TO YOU?
SHE WINKED. tephen: DID SHE? LOOKING GOOD. Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS  COMING ON TO YOU.
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT  IN CHECK.
Stephen: KJERSTIN GRUYS,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US.
THANK YOU. Stephen: KJERSTIN GRUYS,  MIRROR IRKS MIRROR OFF THE WALL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
