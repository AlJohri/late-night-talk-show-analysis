WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLKS, IT'S COLD AND FLU SEASON,  AND LET ME TELL YOU PURELL JUST  DOESN'T WORK. I'VE BEEN CHUGGING THAT STUFF  FOR WEEKS AND I STILL FEEL  NAUSEOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE THREATDOWN: [SIRENS] CONTAGION EDITION. THREAT NUMBER 5:  THE FLU! FOLKS, I'VE HAD A BEEF WITH  INFLUENZA EVER SINCE THE EARLY  20th CENTURY WHEN 50 MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY SPANISH  FLU. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE TELLING ME AN AMERICAN  PATHOGEN WOULDN'T DO THAT JOB? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS YEAR, WE COULD ALL BE  AT RISK.
FLU EMERGENCY: THE WORST FLU  SEASON IN DECADES AND IT'S  GETTING EVEN WORSE.
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A  FULL-BLOWN FLU EPIDEMIC.
THE NUMBER OF FLU CASES IS  EXPLODING.
ALL BUT THREE STATES NOW IN  THE GRIP OF THE FLU EPIDEMIC.
THE FLU EPIDEMIC HAS PEOPLE  ACROSS THE COUNTRY SCRAMBLING  FOR VACCINATIONS.
SOME HOSPITALS ARE SEEING  SUCH A HIGH NUMBER OF FLU  PATIENTS, THAT THEY CAN BARELY HANDLE TREATING EVERYONE.
Stephen: CLEARLY HOSPITALS  ARE SHORT STAFFED. NO ONE'S HAD TIME TO TREAT THAT  TERRIBLE RASH AROUND CHUCK  TODD'S MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FOLKS, JUST LOOK AT  THIS GLOBAL FLU ACTIVITY MAP ON  GOOGLE TRENDS. THE U.S. IS SO INFECTED, WE'RE  FILLING UP SOUTH AMERICA WITH  OUR PHLEGM. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM CHILLED BY WARNINGS FROM  THE NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR  INFECTIOUS DISEASES, WHO WARNED THAT CHILDREN EXHALE MORE FLU  GERMS THAN ADULTS WHEN THEY GET  SICK, AND THEY EXHALE IT LONGER, MAKING THEM THE "GREAT  DISTRIBUTORS OF INFLUENZA  VIRUS."  NATION, WE MUST QUARANTINE OUR CHILDREN IMMEDIATELY. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT UP  BUILDINGS TO SEQUESTER THEM. WE'LL GROUP THEM BY AGE, AND  KEEP THEM THERE DURING HIGH  ACTIVITY HOURS, SAY FROM 8:00 TO  3:00. [ LAUGHTER ] BUS THEM IF WE HAVE TO! [ LAUGHTER ] BUT LOCKING UP YOUR KIDS TO  AVOID THE FLU DOESN'T MEAN  YOU'RE SAFE.
A NEW STRAIN OF A VIRUS IS  QUICKLY SPREADING ACROSS SEVERAL  COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES WHERE FOLKS ARE CALLING  IT: THE  WINTER VOMITING BUG.
Stephen: YES, THE WINTER  VOMITING BUG! FAR WORSE THAN THE SPRING  VOMITING BUG, WHICH AT LEAST  GETS YOU IN SHAPE FOR BIKINI  SEASON. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S AFFECTING SCORES OF  AMERICANS COME FROM? JOLLY OLD ENGLAND! HMM, WHO DO WE KNOW FROM ENGLAND  WHO WAS RECENTLY VOMITING?
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS IS  EXPECTED TO STAY IN HOSPITAL FOR  SEVERAL DAYS. NOW WE LEARN, THE DUCHESS OF  CAMBRIDGE IS HOSPITALIZED FOR  SEVERE VOMITING.
Stephen: THREAT NUMBER 4:  KATE MIDDLETON! [ LAUGHTER ] SHE'S PRINCESS ZERO! TYPHOID QUEEN MARY! HER ROYAL HURL-NESS! [ LAUGHTER ] THANKS TO KATE, THIS WINTER  VOMITING BUG COULD BECOME A  GLOBAL PANDEMIC. BECAUSE KATE IS THE ULTIMATE  TRENDSETTER BECAUSE IF SHE CAN  MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO WEAR A PLATE ON THEIR HEAD, SHE CAN MAKE YOU  WANT TO WEAR YOUR LUNCH. ON YOUR SLEEVE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND DON'T THINK SCIENCE IS GONNA  COME TO THE RESCUE.
BRITISH RESEARCHERS HAVE  CREATED A PROJECTILE VOMITTING  ROBOT THAT MIMICS THE SYMPTOMS OF NOROVIRUS. RESEREACHERS CREATED THE  PROJECTILE ROBOT TO TEST HOW FAR  THE DANGEROUS CONTAGION SPREADS EVERYTIME SOMEONE THROWS UP.
Stephen: BECAUSE IF YOU WANT  TO STUDY VOMIT SPRAY PATTERNS,  YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS: BUILD A ROBOT THAT PUKES, OR RIDE THE  SUBWAY AFTER 2:00 AM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH BRINGS ME THREAT NUMBER 3:  VOMITING ROBOTS. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY, SCIENCE? YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T CURED CANCER  YET, RIGHT? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT SOME OF  THIS ENERGY INTO THAT. BECAUSE ONCE OUR ROBOTS ARE  WOMITING, WHO'S GOING TO CLEAN  UP AFTER MY ROOMBA? [ LAUGHTER ] MY OTHER ROOMBA? IT'LL START PUKING WHEN IT SEES  THE FIRST ONE BLOW CHUNKS. [ LAUGHTER ] ON THE PLUS SIDE, WE FINALLY  HAVE A ROBOT THE JAPANESE WON'T  WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEY SHOULD, BECAUSE...
NEW STRAINS OF DRUG  RESTISTANT GONORRHEA HAVE SPREAD  TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
GONORRHEA IS BEGINNING TO  OUTSMART OUR DRUGS.
Stephen: THREAT NUMBER 2:  SUPERINTELLIGENT GONORRHEA! [ LAUGHTER ] A STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT GONORRHEA  HAS BECOME RESISTANT TO THE ORAL  ANTIBIOTIC CEFIXIME. SO IF YOU'VE GOT VD, CEFIX-I-ME  WILL NO LONGER CE-FIX-A- YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] OR ANYONE ELSE! MEANING EVERYONE IS IN DANGER. EVERYONE EXCEPT FOR THE NUMBER  ONE THREAT TO AMERICA:  BEARS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JIM?
SCIENTISTS SAY PANDA BLOOD  COULD HELP STAVE OFF ILLNESS. THEYV'E DISCOVERED A POWERFUL  ANTIBIOTIC THAT EXISITS IN THE  BLOODFLOW OF GIANT PANDAS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. PANDAS HAVE SUPER ANTIBIOTICS IN  THEIR BLOOD, AND ALL THIS TIME  THEY WERE PRETENDING THEY NEEDED OUR PROTECTION-- "OOH, SHELTER  US! WE'LL DIE IF SOMEONE LOOKS AT US  TOO HARD!" [ LAUGHTER ] AND ARE THEY OFFERING TO SHARE  THEIR SUPER-RESISTANT BLOOD? NO! THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR US TO  BE WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THE  EARTH BY SUPER CLAP THAT WON'T HARM THEM! IT'LL BE PLANET OF THE APES,  ONLY THE APES ARE PANDAS, AND  THIS TIME THE PLANET IS EARTH! [ LAUGHTER ]
