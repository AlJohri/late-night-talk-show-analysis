( LAUGHTER )  AND NOW THE C-OH-LBERT BOOK  CLUB. REMEMBER THE FIRST RULE OF BOOK  CLUB-- DON'T READ "FIGHT CLUB."  NOW, TONIGHT IN STRICT ADHERENCE TO BOOK CLUB GUIDELINES, I HAVE  BEEN DRINKING CHARDONNAY SINCE  1:00 P.M. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND OUR INAUGURAL BOOK IS "THE  GREAT GATSBY" BY F. SCOTT  FITZGERALD. I CHOSE IT IN PART BECAUSE  THERE'S A NEW "GREAT GATSBY"  MANUFACTURE THE SAME WAY WHEN THE MOVIE "LIFE OF PI" COME OUT,  I READ THE NUMBER PI TO THE  500th DECIMAL. SPOILER ALERT?
SPOILER ALERT-- 2. AFTER THAT IT GETS KIND OF  REPETITIVE. BUT, FOLKS, IT'S NOST JUST  BECAUSE THERE'S A MOVIE COMING  OUT. WE'RE ALSO READING "THE GREAT  GATSBY" BECAUSE IT'S BELIEVE TO  BE A CLASSIC OF AMERICAN  LITERATURE. THE MODERN LIBRARY CALLS IT ONE  OF THE FIVE NOVELS OF ALM TIME  AND AMAZON REVIEWRL "THE JAKAL," GAVE IT THREE OUT OF FIVE STARS,  RATING:  DECENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SHE'S GOOD. A LOT OF JACKAL FANS HERE  TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, TONIGHT TO EXPLORE THIS  BOOK, I WILL BE JOINED BY  PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING NOVELIST JENNIFER EGAN. AND TO DISCUSS HIS MOVIE, I'LL  BE TALKING TO DIRECTOR BAZ  LUHRMAN, WHO YOU MAY REMEMBER, FOR HAVING WRITTEN WILLIAM  SHAKESPEARE'S "ROMEO AND  JULIETTE."  ( APPLAUSE )  NOW, OF COURSE, SINCE I HAVE KNOWN FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS  THAT I WAS GOING TO BE STUSSING  THIS BOOK ON TELEVISION, I HAVE BEEN PREPARING. FIRST, BY READING IT. ( LAUGHTER )  , WHICH I REALLY ENJOYED AND  DEFINITELY DID DO. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT TO REALLY BONE UP ON ALL OF  THAT READING OF THIS BOOK THAT  DID, EARLIER TODAY, I COMPARED NOTES WITH OSCAR-NOMINATED STAR  OF "AN EDUCATION," CAN THE  DRIVE, AND THE DRY, CAREY  MULLIGAN.

THE MOVIE IS VERY TRUE TO THE  BOOK AND THE HUMAN COMPLICATIONS  ARE JUST AS PAINFUL AND PERCEPTIVE ON THE BIG SCREEN AS  ON THE PAGE. AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT  TOBY AND NICK AND LEAH AS GATSBY  WHO IS JUST PERFECT.
Stephen:  WHEN I READ  "GATSBY" I THOUGHT LEO POP WHOSE  IDEA WAS IT TO CAST HIM?
