Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE ONE OF THE BEST RAPPERS IN THE WORLD. OH, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS. PLEASE WELCOME KENDRICK LAMAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, MR. LAMAR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. A LOT OF EXCITEMENT IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT TO HAVE YOU ON. BIG FANS AROUND HERE.
APPRECIATE IT.
Stephen:  HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M FEELING GOOD. WHAT'S GOING ON?
Stephen:  HEY, LISTEN, I'M GOING TO START GUY SAYING NO PRESSURE. I KNOW YOU'RE GREAT AND EVERYBODY THINKS YOU'RE ALL THAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS, BUT YOU ARE THE LAST "COLBERT REPORT" MUSICAL GUEST.
RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  HONORED TO HAVE YOU ON, BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT MEANS THAT PAUL McCARTNEY, REM, JACK WHITE, AND NAV WERE YOUR OPENING ACTS. YOU ARE CONSIDERED, LIKE, SORT OF THE LEADER OF WEST COAST RAP RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHAT SNOOP SAID YOU WERE. WITH THAT JOB TITLE, IS IT HARD TO GET LIFE INSURANCE IN BECAUSE-- ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT DOES IT MEAN YOU'RE THE LEADER OF WEST COAST RAP? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
AS FAR AS THE NEW SCHOOL AND DOING WHAT I DO, BEING INFLUENCED BY SNOOP, FIRST OF ALL, AND TAKING THE TALENT THAT I LEARNED AND PERFECTING IT TO MY OWN AND PEOPLE CALLING IT GOOD.
Stephen:  YOU CALL YOURSELF A RAPPER/WRITER.
YEAH, A WRITER.
Stephen:  SO IF I LISTEN TO YOUR WHOLE ALBUM. CAN I SAY I READ A BOOK THIS YEAR? WHY DO YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF A WRITER INSTEAD OF A RAPPER?
I PRIDE MYSELF ON THAT. IT'S MORE STORYTELLING THAN PUTTING RHYMING WORDS TOGETHER.
Stephen:  BUT YOU RHYME WORDS PRETTY WELL.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen:  CAN YOU RHYME COLBERT.
COLBERT? NO HAIR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THERE YOU GO. IN "I" YOU SAY YOU WANT TO GIVE YOUR STORY TO CHILDREN SO THEY LEARN LESSONS FROM YOUR LIFE. WHAT STORY, WHAT LESSONS?
COMING FROM A DARK PLACE AND DOING SOMETHING POSITIVE.
Stephen:  YOU'RE FROM COMPTON, RIGHT?
I'M FROM COMPTON.
Stephen: ARE YOU STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON? THERE WERE NO DETOURS?
NO DETOURS
Stephen: THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN COMPTON AND HERE?
NO BACK STREETS
Stephen:  YOU DIDN'T HAVE A LAYOVER IN DES MOINES OR ANYTHING? YOU DON'T CHASE FAME OR CELEBRITY?
NO.
Stephen:  WHY? BECAUSE IT IS GREAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) EVERYTHING ELSE I'VE GOTTEN IS IS BECAUSE I CHASED FAME AND CELEBRITY. EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST GRAVY. WHY DON'T YOU WANT FAME AND CELEBRITY.
IT'S NOT A BAD THING BUT AT THE SAME TIME I ALWAYS WANT TO STAY TRUE TO WHO I AM.
Stephen:  AND WHO IS THAT?
KENDRICK LAMAR, STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON
Stephen:  OK WE ARE GOING TO ASK YOU-- THIS CONFUSES ME, IF YOU'RE STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON-- BY THE WAY, YOU HANG OUT WITH DRE?
YEAH.
Stephen:  YOU SAY YOU DON'T SMOKE POT SO DO YOU GUYS JUST TALK ABOUT, LIKE, HEADPHONES AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
YEAH, DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY
Stephen: OK SO STRAIGHT  OUT OF COMPTON, KENDRICK LAMAR. WHY DID YOU DECIDE-- LIKE RAPPERS TAKE STAGE NAMES, LIKE BIGGIE SMALLS OR ICED T WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO NAME YOURSELF AFTER ANNA KENDRICK AND SENATOR LAMAR ALEXANDER.
I JUST WANTED TO BE TRUE TO MYSELF.
Stephen:  YOU GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR A SONG LAST YEAR, IT'S CALLED "SWIMMING POOLS." OKAY, AND IN THAT SONG YOU GOT A LYRIC HERE THAT SAYS GET A SWIMMING POOL FULL OF LIQUOR AND DIVE IN. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT SELLING THAT TO THE GOOD PEOPLE AT DEWAR'S?
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
Stephen:  JUST ADD THE WORD "RESPONSIBLY" AT THE END. HEY, LISTEN, LISTEN, THERE, LISTEN, THERE KENDRICK LAMAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I UNDERSTAND-- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO A NEW SONG RIGHT NOW, WORLD PREMIERE--
YES.
Stephen:  WORLD PREMIERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
IT'S ACTUALLY UNTITLED.
Stephen:  WOULD YOU DO IT FOR US NOW? THANK YOU SO MUCH. KENDRICK LAMAR, PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE WORLD PREMIERE BY KENDRICK LAMAR.
