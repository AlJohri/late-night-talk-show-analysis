(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, TONIGHT I COME TO YOU WITH NEWS OF A SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH GIVING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HOPE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. I SIT HERE AS EYEWITNESS TO HISTORY, PRIVILEGED TO SAY THE FOLLOWING WORDS -- MOUNTAIN DEW NOW TASTES LIKE DORITOS. JIM?
PEPSI AND FRITO-LAY HAVE TEAMED UP TO CREATE DORITOS-FLAVORED MOUNTAIN DEW. THE NEW SODA IS CALLED DEWITOS AND IS NOW BEING TASTE-TESTED ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.
Stephen: YES, FOOD SCIENTISTS ARE USING UNDERGRAD LAB RATS TO TEST A NEW DORITO-MOUNTAIN DEW HYBRID. YOU WERE RIGHT, STONERS -- FRITO-LAY CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS! (LAUGHTER) FINALLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION -- WHAT IF MY DORITOS WERE WET  AND CAFFEINATED? WHAT WOULD THAT TASTE LIKE?
KENT STATE FRESHMAN STEVE BARNES TASTED DEWITOS SODA AT THE OHIO COLLEGE RECENTLY. HE DESCRIBES IT AS LIKE ORANGE WITH A NACHO CHEESE AFTERTASTE.
Stephen: MAKES SENSE. THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN DORITOS IS "AFTERTASTE." NOW, THANKS TO PEPSI CO. INNOVATORS, THOSE WHO WANT TO DRINK THEIR NACHO NO LONGER HAVE TO FIND THE A.M.C. CONCESSION STAND WHERE NOBODY'S WATCHING THE CHEESE PUMP. FOLKS, I GOTTA SAY, I'LL ADMIT, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT I ONCE WAS A DEW DOUBTER. I NEVER THOUGHT MOUNTAIN DEW WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE COLD FUSION. BUT, BOY, DID I SLURP MY WORDS. AND NOW PEPSICO HAS MADE GOOD ON THEM ACTUAL 2012 PROMISE TO, QUOTE, TAKE FOODS AND DRINKIFY THEM. (AUDIENCE REACTS) HOW FITTING. MY FAVORITE TIME TO EAT DORITOS IS WHEN I'M DRUNKIFIED. (LAUGHTER) AND WITH DEW-ITOS NOW A REALITY, MANKIND IS APPROACHING THE LONG-PREDICTED SNACK SINGULARITY -- THE SNACKULARITY, IF YOU WILL. (LAUGHTER) IN WHICH FOOD SCIENTISTS ACHIEVE A UNITY OF ALL FLAVORS. DRINKS THAT TASTE LIKE CHIPS, CHIPS THAT TASTE LIKE DIPS. WE ARE ALL FLAVORNAUTS, EXPLORING THE OUTER REACHES OF THE MILKY WAY. WHICH IS NOW AVAILABLE AS A NASAL SPRAY. THAT'LL WAKE YOU UP (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN MORE PROFOUND, THE DAWN OF DEW-ITOS BRINGS US TO THE VERY INTERSECTION OF SCIENCE AND SPIRITUALITY, AND OPENS THE TASTEBUDS TO AN INFINITE FOOD COURT OF THE MIND, KNOWN TO THE BUDDHISTS AS THE  THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD GORDITA. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE BUDDHA WOULD HAVE POUNDED THAT THING! (LAUGHTER) SO I SALUTE THE SNACKOLOGISTS WHO PIONEERED THIS DEWITOS BREAKTHROUGH. UNTIL NOW, TO GET THIS FLAVOR COMBO, YOU'D HAVE TO CONSUME MOUNTAIN DEW AND DORITOS SEPARATELY AND THEN THROW UP IN YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE. (LAUGHTER) JUST A LITTLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THAT WOULD BE A GREAT SLOGAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
