Stephen: TONIGHT A NEW WAY TO  STOP OBAMA-CARE. INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM DEATH  PANELS, HOW ABOUT MURDER  COUNCILS? THEN A NEW VICTORY FOR GUN  RIGHTS. I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD SHOOT IN  THE AIR TO CELEBRATE. PLUS MY GUEST ROCK FOLKERS THE  LUMINEERS ARE HERE BECAUSE OF  THE RE-RELEASE OF THEIR FIRST ALBUM ALTHOUGH IF YOU ASK ME  THEIR EARLIER STUFF IS MUCH  BETTER. CHINA IS LAUNCHING A 24-HOUR  PANDA-CAM. OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THOSE  MAJESTIC CREATURES ASSEMBLE AN  I-PAD. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANKS.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. NATION, NATION, I HOPE YOU'RE  READY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LOCK  YOUR LUNGS AND BATTEN DOWN YOUR COLON BECAUSE OBAMA-CARE IS  COMING. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE TAKES  EFFECT ON NEW YEAR'S DAY WHICH  MEANS WHEN THE TIMES SQUARE BALL DROPS, IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BE  CHECKED FOR LUMPS. WORSE, FOLKS, WORSE, THIS  BLOATED BUREAUCRATIC PROGRAM  THAT WILL NEVER WORK HAS STARTED  WORKING.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND  HUMAN SERVICES ANNOUNCED IN 11  STATES AND WASHINGTON D.C. PREMIUMS IN THE HEALTH CARE  MARKETPLACE REQUIRED BY OBAMA  CARE ARE TURNING OUT TO BE NEARLY 20% LOWER THAN PROJECTED  FOR 2014.
Stephen: MAYBE SO. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIVE ANY  LONGER BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT,  MOST AMERICANS ARE GOING TO BLOW THOSE SAVINGS ON CRONUTS. AND THE DEATH SENTENCE, AND  OBAMA-CARE IS BEING IMPLEMENTED  DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE VOTED  TO SYMBOLICALLY REPEAL IT 39  TIMES. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT  WORKING. MAYBE THEY NEED TO LOAD MORE  EMPTINESS INTO THEIR GESTURES. I DON'T KNOW NOW THE KEY TO  IMPLEMENTING OBAMA-CARE IS THE  SO-CALLED INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BECAUSE TO KEEP PREMIUM COSTS  DOWN OFFICIALS SAY THEY MUST  REGISTER 2.7 MILLION HEALTHY PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18  AND 35 IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT  THE COSTS OF ENSURING SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS. DON'T FALL FOR IT, YOUNG PEOPLE. YOU DON'T NEED INSURANCE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE YOUNG AND  HEALTHY FOREVER. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT ME. I'M 19 LOOK AT THIS AWESOME  SKATEBOARD MOVE. THAT IS CALLED POPPING A YOLO. NOW FORTUNATELY, THE GODFATHER  OF THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT  FREEDOMWORKS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A "BURN YOUR OBAMA CARE CARD"  CAMPAIGN. THAT'S RIGHT, YOUNG ONES. PROTEST THIS GOVERNMENT  OVERREACH BY LIGHTING YOUR  INSURANCE CARD ON FIRE. BUT BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF YOU  BURN YOURSELF YOU DON'T HAVE  HEALTH INSURANCE. THERE'S ONLY ONE SMALL PROBLEM  WITH THIS BURN YOUR OBAMA-CARE  CARD PLAN. THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS  OBAMA-CARE CARDS. BUT FREEDOMWORKS ISN'T LETTING A  LITTLE THING LIKE NOT EXISTING  GET IN ITS WAY AS THEIR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY DEAN  CLANCY EXPLAINED.
FREEDOM WORKS IS GOING TO  DESIGN THE OBAMA-CARE CARD  OURSELVES. WE ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ONLINE  AND SHARE IT WITH PEOPLE IN THE  HOPES THAT THEY WILL BURN IT, TEAR IT UP, MARK ON IT.
Stephen: YES. BURN IT. TEAR IT. MARK IT. BUT FIRST PRINT IT, CUT IT AND  LAMINATE IT. FREEDOMWORKS IS OPENING UP A  WHOLE NEW WORLD OF FIGHTING SIM  SYMBOLS OF INJUSTICE THAT DON'T  EXIST. THEY SHOULD REFNT A BUS, ORDER  THEMSELVES TO SIT AT THE BACK OF  THE BUS AND THEN REFUSE TO SIT AT THE BACK OF THEIR OWN BUS. POWER. THE POINT IS BURNING THINGS IS  ALWAYS AN ATTENTION GETTER. AND FREEDOMWORKS SPECIAL EVENTS  MANAGER EMILIA HUNEKE-BERQUIST  EXPLAINED WHY BURNING THIS CARD WAS SO NATURAL.
BACK IN THE DAY, JUST THE  SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT DECIDED  THAT EACH AND EVERY MALE IN THE U.S. IS GOING TO NEED TO CARRY A  DRAFT CARD. AND AS THE VIETNAM WAR GOT ARE  REALLY HEATED UP IN '65, '65  CITIZENS EVERYWHERE DECIDED TO BURN THEIR CARDS IN PROTEST OF  THE ACTIONS BIG GOVERNMENT WAS  TAKING. AND SO HERE WE ARE ABOUT 50  YEARS LATER, WE'RE FACING A NEW  KIND OF GOVERNMENT MANDATE UNDER OBAMA-CARE AND SO WE'VE DECIDED  THAT WE'RE GOING TO TORCH OUR  OWN CARDS.
Stephen: PEOPLE FORGET THAT  ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR. THOSE HIPPIES WERE JUST FISCAL  CONSERVATIVES PROTESTING A BIG  GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A WHOLE  GENERATION FORCED TO FIGHT  INFECTION IN SOME NEARBY COUNTY HOSPITAL ONLY TO COME HOME IN  ONE PIECE WITH SOMETHING TO LIVE  FOR. I MEAN, KEEP ON TRUCKING. WELL I SAY IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE  TRULY WANT TO RESIST OBAMA-CARE  THEY NEED TO DO WHAT VIETNAM PROTESTORS DID IN THE '60s AND  MOVE TO CANADA. BONUS: I HEAR THEY HAVE A GREAT  HEALTH CARE SYSTEM UP THERE THAT  DOESN'T COST THAT MUCH. NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  YOU KNOW I DON'T MINCE WORDS. I HAVE A LITTLE GUATEMALAN WOMAN  WHO MINCES THEM FOR ME. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WALL OF  THE FINGER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, EVER SINCE THE TRAGIC  EVENTS IN BENGHAZI LAST YEAR  WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GATHER ALL THE FACTS BUT THERE ARE TWO  THINGS WE KNOW: ONE, HILLARY  CLINTON IS COMPLETELY TO BLAME. AND TWO, BARACK OBAMA IS  COMPLETELY TO BLAME. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ONE OF THOSE  STORIES WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH  ABOUT LATELY BECAUSE IT HASN'T PASSED THROUGH A ROYAL BIRTH  CANAL OR TAKEN A PICTURE OF ITS  OWN PENIS. BUT ONE MAN OUT THERE IS  FIGHTING TO BRING BENGS AY BACK  INTO THE NEWS WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO TEXAS  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND  REALTOR YOU FOUND ON A BENCH AD, STEVE STOCKMAN. JIM?
NEW PUSH FOR ANSWERS ON  BENGHAZI IN A BIG WAY ON THE  HILL. SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS  BREAKING RANKS DEMANDING A  SPECIAL INVESTIGATION.
WE ARE LIVE ON THE STEPS OF  THE CAPITOL FOR A RALLY BEING  HELD BY SPECIAL OPERATION VETS AS THEY UNROLL WHAT THEY'RE  CALLING, QUOTE, THE LARGEST EVER  PETITION TO CONGRESS.
LITERALLY, A 60-FOOT LONG  SCROLL OF VETERAN SIGNATURES WHO  WANT THIS INVESTIGATION TO  HAPPEN.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. A 60-FOOT LONG PETITION. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF  YOU TOOK 60 SUBWAY FOOT LONGS  AND LINED THEM UP ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING SOMEBODY  WOULD DEFINITELY START A  PETITION TO GET THOSE SANDWICHES OUT OF THERE. THEY'RE GOING TO DRAW RATS. OF COURSE, YOU MAY BE WONDERING  HOW MANY NAMES CAN YOU FIT ON A  60-FOOT SCROLL? QUARTER OF A MILLION? 900,000? WELL, PREPARE YOURSELF, NATION,  BECAUSE REPRESENTATIVE  STOCKMAN'S PETITION HAS ONE POINT 1 THOUSAND SIGNATURES ON  IT. IT WAS 999 NORMAL-SIZED  SIGNATURES AND ONE PERSON WHO  LIKES TO DOT HER I'S WITH TWO MILLION TINY HEARTS. NATION, I'D LIKE TO SHOW MY  SUPPORT FOR STEVE STOCKMAN'S  BOLD EMPTY GESTURE WITH A BOLD EMPTY GESTURE OF MY OWN WHICH IS  WHY I'M TAKING A 65-FOOT  PETITION TO CONGRESS. NOT ONLY IS IT FIVE FEET LONGER  THAN CONGRESSMAN STOCKMAN'S. IT'S ALSO TWO PLY. OKAY.  YOU KNOW  FOLKS? THROUGH THE STAIRS I'M GOING TO  COVER THE ENTIRE CAPITOL  BUILDING WITH MY PETITION. IF IT RAINS THEY'LL NEVER GET IT  OFF. NEXT UP FOLKS WE ALL KNOW  PORNOGRAPHY IS A PROBLEM ALL  OVER THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP  OF MY HAT TO BRITISH PRIME  MINISTER DAVID CAMERON FOR FINALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT  IT.
DAVID CAMERON CRACKING DOWN  ON INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY TODAY  ROLLING OUT A PLAN THAT WOULD ADD ADULT CONTENT FILTERS ON  EVERYTHING FROM COMPUTERS TO  SMARTPHONES TO PUBLIC WI-FI  NETWORKS.
Stephen: YES, NOW IT WILL BE  IMPOSSIBLE FOR BRITISH YOUTH TO  SEE PORNOGRAPHY UNLESS THEY CAN SOMEHOW GAIN ACCESS TO PAGE 3 OF  THE SUN. AND IT'S NOT JUST PICTURE AND  VIDEO, FOLKS. THE PRIME MINISTER IS ALSO  PLANNING TO CENSOR KEY SEARCH  TERMS MAKING IT A LOT HARDER TO GOOGLE THE PHRASE "MAKING IT A  LOT HARDER."  BUT BRITISH INTERNET USERS WHO  WANT THEIR MEAT AND TWO VEG CAN STILL SEE IT BECAUSE USERS WILL  BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF THE  SETTING BY REQUEST. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU ENGLISH CAN STILL ENJOY YOUR  BRIT-ROTICA. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK FOR  IT.
PLEASE, SIR. I WANT SOME (DEEP MALE VOICE)  PORN.
WHAT? I WANT SOME (STEPHEN'S  VOICE:) PORN [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: FINALLY, AS A PROUD  SON OF SOUTH CAROLINA, FOLKS, I  RARELY HAVE KIND WORDS FOR THOSE BARBARIANS TO THE NORTH. I MEAN, WHO MAKES BARBECUE SAUCE  WITH VINEGAR? THAT'S WHAT YOU USE TO CLEAN A  TOILET. WHEN I SAY TOILET, I MEAN  CHARLOTTE. BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE, THEIR  REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED STATE  LEGISLATURE IS TURNING NORTH CAROLINA INTO A CONSERVATIVE  SHANGRI-LA PROPOSING FOR PASSING  BILLS THAT WOULD MAKE COUPLES WAIT TWO YEARS TO DIVORCE,  DECLARE AN OFFICIAL STATE  RELIGION AND REMOVE THE  REQUIREMENT THAT CHARTER SCHOOL TEACHERS HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. GREAT MOVE. I MEAN, WHO BETTER TO TEACH  FIFTH GRADE THAN A 6th  GRADER. IT'S STILL FRESH IN HIS MIND. NOT TO MENTION AN INDECENCY BILL  THAT WOULD MAKE IT A FELONY TO  EXPOSE A NIPPLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF AROUSAL. SO, NORTH CAROLINA STRIPPERS, BE  SURE TO ADD A SIGN ON YOUR CHEST  THAT READS "FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY."  WELL, FOLKS, ALL THOSE BILLS  WERE JUST FOREPLAY, WHICH I  BELIEVE IS ALSO ILLEGAL IN NORTH  CAROLINA. BECAUSE I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY  HAT TO THE NORTH CAROLINA  LEGISLATURE FOR MY FAVORITE RESOLUTION YET.
HOUSE BILL 937 APPROVED  TUESDAY BY THE HOUSE AND SENATE  ALLOWS CONCEALED HANDGUN PERMIT HOLDERS TO BRING THEIR WEAPONS  TO BARS AND RESTAURANTS THAT  SERVE ALCOHOL. CONCEALED WEAPONS HOLDERS WILL  ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CARRY THEIR  GUNS ON GREEN WAYS, PLAYGROUNDS AND OTHER PUBLIC RECREATION  AREAS
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. NOW YOU CAN BRING GUNS TO  PLAYGROUNDS AND, FOLKS, WE NEED  THEM BECAUSE THE MONKEY BARS ARE WELL KNOWN AL QAEDA TRAINING  GROUNDS. PLUS GUNS WILL MAKE THE WHOLE  PLAYGROUND EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE  FUN. INSTEAD OF DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE,  YOU CAN JUST PLAY DUCK, DUCK,  DUCK! AND GUNS WILL MEAN MUCH LESS  WORK FOR BUSY PARENTS WHO ARE  TIRED OF PUSHING THEIR KIDS ON THE SWINGS, AS YOU CAN SEE IN  THIS COLBERT REPORT EXCLUSIVE  GRAPHIC SIMULATION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
