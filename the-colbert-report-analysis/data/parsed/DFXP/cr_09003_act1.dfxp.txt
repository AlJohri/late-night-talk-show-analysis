TONIGHT, MITT ROMNEY STILL  TRAILS IN THE POLLS!  COULD BIT  BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OTHER  CHOICES?  THEN A BREAKTHROUGH IN MEN'S VITALITY.
WHAT VAGINA SUBSTITUTES WE  WILL BE THROWING FOOTBALLS  THROUGH NEXT AND MY GUEST IS  COUNTRY MUSIC LEGEND KENNY ROGERS, I WILL ASK HIM IF THOSE  ISLANDS IN THE STREAM MAKE GOOD  TAX SHELTERS. AND PORNOGRAPHERS WERE CAUGHT  FILMING IN THE CORNELL  UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. CLEARLY, THEY COULD NOT GET INTO  THE HEAR EXTRAORDINARY LIBRARY. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Colbert: WELCOME. THAT IS INCREDIBLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. BOY, I CAN FEEL THE ELECTRICITY. I CAN FEEL THE ELECTRICITY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE,  OUT THERE, ACROSS AMERICA, YOU  KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE EXCITED  BECAUSE IT IS A HUGE NIGHT. THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE  JUST HAPPENED IN DENVER. NOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET SO  DON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS. JIM.
THE BUYING QUESTION IS DO  THESE DEBATES REALLY MATTER?
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IS THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE THE FIRST  TWO CANDIDATES AND REALLY START TO MAKE THEIR MIND UP.
IF THE DEBATES HAPPEN REALLY  LATE IN THE CYCLE AND BY THIS  TIME MOST AMERICANS HAVE MADE UP THEIR MIND.
I THINK THE DEBATES DON'T  MATTER MUCH.
THEY MATTER AND THEY HAVE  MATTER ADD GREAT DEAL, SOME  YEARS THEY HAVE NOT MATTERED AT  ALL.
Colbert: SO, WE PUNDITS  DON'T KNOW WHETHER DEBATES  MATTER BUT WE DO KNOW WHETHER  DEBATE OVER WHETHER DEBATES MATTER, MATTER.
BOTTOM LINE, BOTTOM LINE,  THESE MEANINGLESS, USELESS  DEBATES ARE CRUCIAL. ESPECIALLY FOR THE ROMNEY  CAMPAIGN.
THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN LOOKS AT  THIS AS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT  TONIGHT, THEY RECOGNIZE THIS IS  THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THE  COUNTRY. THEY DON'T KNOW HILLARY.  THIS  IS THE TIME FOR HIM TO INTRODUCE  HIMSELF. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW MITT ROMNEY. AND WE LIVE IN A VERY DISTRACTED  AGE WHERE EVERYBODY HAS IPADS,  IPODS, BLUEBERRIES, THEY HAVE  STUFF IN THEIR EAR.
OH, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. ..
ALL RIGHT. WHAT IS THAT?  WHAT IS THAT?   YEAH, NO. HOLD ON.  CAN YOU HOLD  ON?  I HAVE ANOTHER CALL. HOLD ON. HELLO?  HELLO?  YES?  UH-HUH. UH-HUH. YOU HAVE GOT WHAT?  I HAVE GOT  -- I HAVE GOT A WHAT IN MY EAR?   YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP YAVMENT  HEAR YOU I HAVE A BANANA IN MY  EAR. HMM, HMM, HMM.
THAT GOT IN THERE.
I WILL CALL YOU BACK. BUT PAPA BEAR HAS GOT A POINT. THESE ELECTRONIC GADGETS THAT WE  ALL HAVE NOW -- THEY GIVE US --  THEY GIVE US INFORMATION 24/7,  NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE, AND IT HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO  KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS. I WANT TO SAY LET'S -- ANYWAY,  WHOEVER HE IS, HE NEEDS TO  INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO AMERICA  AGAIN. SURE WE MET HIM BRIEFLY AT THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, DURING  THE PRIMARIES, DURING THE 2008  PRIMARIES, AND WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, BUT  HE JUST WON'T STICK. HE IS LIKE THAT GUY AT THE PARTY  YOU HAVE SEEN A MILLION TIMES  BUT YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME. THAT'S WHY HE TRAILS NOT ONLY  OBAMA IN THE POLLS BUT ALSO WHAT  IS GOING ON BUYING GUY AND HEY,  THERE, CHIEF. WITH WHAT IS GOING ON BIG GUY?
I CAN'T. I TOLD YOU I WOULD CALL.
AND HE IS BEHIND DESPITE HIS  INSPIRING POPULIST MESSAGE, VOTE  FOR ME, YOU PARASITES. LUCKILY, LUCKILY, WASHINGTON  POST COLUMNIST AND VENTRILOQUIST  KNOWS WHY OBAMA IS AHEAD,  RIGHTING THE NATION WHICH IS RELUCTANT TO DECLARE A PRESIDENT  A FAILURE IS ESPECIALLY  RELUCTANT TO GIVE UP ON THE  FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN  PRESIDENT. YES. SOMEBODY HAD TO SAY IT, THE  PRESIDENT IS ONLY WINNING  BECAUSE HE IS BLACK. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID, OUR SYSTEM  IS RIGGED IN FAVOR OF  AFRICAN-AMERICANS. NOW, I AM NOT GOING TO WIN AN  KNAPP AWARD, NAACP AWARD FOR  SAYING THIS BUT BLACK PEOPLE IN  THIS COUNTRY HAVE GOTTEN ONE FREE RIDE AFTER ANOTHER,  STARTING WITH THE FIRST ONE, AND  LET ME -- IT IS TRUE!  IT IS  TRUE!
OKAY, LET ME ASK THE WHITE  PEOPLE. OKAY, LET ME ASK THE WHITE  PEOPLE. I BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE ONE OR  ALL OF THEM IN MY AUDIENCE,  RIGHT?  HAS A BLACK PERSON EVER  THANKED YOU FOR FREEING THE SLAVES?  WHEN I WALKED UP TO  AFRICAN-AMERICANS ON THE STREET  AND SAY, YOU'RE WELCOME, THEY  DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. IT IS LIKE WE DON'T TEACH IT IN  THE SCHOOLS ANYMORE. THE POINT IS, AMERICANS ARE  AFRAID TO FIRE BARACK OBAMA  BECAUSE OF WHITE GUILT. AND WE HAVE GOT TO FREE  OURSELVES FROM IT AS GEORGE WELL  WRITES IN HIS CONTRACTUALLY  MANDATED EXPENDED BASEBALL ANALOGY, QUOTE, A SIGNIFICANT  DATE IN THE NATION'S CIVIL  RIGHTS PROGRESS WAS OCTOBER 3RD,  1974, WHEN FRANK ROBINSON WAS HIRED BY THE CLEVELAND INDIANS  AS THE MAJOR LEAGUE'S FIRST  BLACK MANAGER, BUT EVEN MORE  IMPORTANT MILESTONE OF PROGRESS OCCURRED JUNE 19TH, 1977 WHEN  THE INDIANS FIRED HIM, THAT WAS  COLOR BLIND EQUALITY, ANOTHER  RACIAL BARRIER HAD FALLEN. FOLKS, I HAVE LONG APPRECIATED  THE DEEP RELATION VOIR OF RACIAL  SENSITIVITY THAT IS THE  CLEVELAND INDIANS. .. ME HAVE EM DREAM.
AND GEORGE IS RIGHT. NOTHING SAYS RACIAL PROGRESS  LIKE FIRING A BLACK PERSON. I MEAN, THIS ARTICLE IS A  MASTERFUL PIECE OF POLITICAL  POST RACIAL JOURNALISM BY AN  INTELLECTUAL TITAN. IT PAINS ME TO SAY THAT GEORGE  REALLY SCREWED THE POOCH ON THIS  ONE. GEORGE, YOU CAN'T JUST WRITE A  COLUMN SAYING THE ONLY REASON  WHITE PEOPLE ARE STILL VOTING  FOR BARACK OBAMA IS BECAUSE HE IS BLACK. BECAUSE IF YOU COULD, MY AUNT  RITA WOULD BE WRITING YOUR  COLUMN, AND LET ME TELL YOU, SHE  HAS GOT SOME PULITZER PRIZE WINNING OPINIONS ABOUT THE  GREEKS. NO, THERE ARE FAR MORE DELICATE  WAYS TO BRING UP OBAMA'S RACE. IT IS A VERY IMPROBABLE AND  EXOTIC LIFE, BECAUSE HE WAS  RAISED VERY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS  AND I THINK ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST AMERICANS  WORLD VIEW. WE HAVE A VERY, VERY URBAN  SENATOR, BARACK OBAMA.
I AM ASSUMING THERE IS SOME  RHYTHM TO BARACK OBAMA THAT THE  REST OF US DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SEE?  YOU CAN REMIND PEOPLE  OBAMA IS BLACK WITHOUT OFFENDING  THOSE WHO, LET'S SAY, TEND NOT TO OWN NHL TEAMS. THOSE KIND OF SENSITIVE CODE  WORDS ARE JUST JOURNALISM 101,  THIS GUY JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW  TO DO HIS JOB, AND YET THE WASHINGTON POST KEEPS HIM YEAR  AFTER YEAR. I DON'T -- OH, MY GOD. THERE IS ONLY ONE EXPLANATION. GEORGE WILL IS BLACK!  I NEVER  NOTICED. BUT NOW YOU MENTIONED IT WITH  THAT BOW TIE HE COULD BE NATION  OF ISLAM. , YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T SEE IT  BECAUSE I DON'T SEE RACE, NOT  EVEN MY OWN. PEOPLE TELL ME I AM WHITE AND I  BELIEVE THEM, BECAUSE I THINK  THE CHRONIC REFERS TO LOWER BACK  PAIN, THE WASHINGTON POST, I CALL ON YOU TO END THE SUBTLE  RACISM OF LOWERED EXPECTATIONS  YOU HAVE COMMITTED BY KEEPING  AFRICAN-AMERICAN PIONEER GEORGE WILL ON YOUR PAYROLL. FIRE THIS MAN!  IT WOULD BE A  TRUE BLOW TO CIVIL RIGHTS!  WE  WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
