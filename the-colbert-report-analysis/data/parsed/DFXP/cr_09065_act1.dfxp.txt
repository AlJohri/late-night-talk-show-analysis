Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW  IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, IF YOU  READ THE NEWS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMERICA THERE'S  NO DENYING THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS  BEEN A FAILED PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] AS TERRIBLE AS PRESIDENT OBAMA  HAS BEEN, HIS CABINET  APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN  WORSE. I MEAN, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY  RAY LAHOOD? WHY? BECAUSE HIS NAME'S GOT A  CAR PART IN IT? THAT'S A LOW STANDARD. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS NEXT? SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY PENNY  McNICKEL? NOW HE WANTS THE NEW DEFENSE  SECRETARY TO BE FORMER  REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHUCK HAGEL. THANKFULLY, TODAY 15 REPUBLICAN  SENATORS DEMANDED THE WITHDRAWAL  OF HAGEL'S NOMINATION AND IT'S NO WONDER. SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE FOUND  ALL SORTS OF SHADY ASSOCIATIONS  IN HAGEL'S PAST. FOR INSTANCE, HE WAS ONCE A  SENATE REPUBLICAN. [LAUGHTER] AND NOW, ACCORDING TO  CONSERVATIVE NEWS ANGER-GREGATOR  BREITBART.COM, HAGEL MAY HAVE TAKEN MONEY FROM AN ORGANIZATION  CALLED "FRIENDS OF HAMAS."  FRIENDS OF HAMAS! THAT'S SERIOUS! BEING FRIENDS WITH A MUSLIM  TERRORIST IS A BIG COMMITMENT. YOU'VE GOT TO BE A GROOMSMAN IN  ALL FOUR OF THEIR WEDDINGS. I MEAN, THE SUICIDE VEST  RENTALS ALONE! [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, THIS BOMBSHELL LIT UP THE  CONSERV-OSPHERE.
LET ME BRING UP ONE PIECE OF  INFORMATION THAT BEN SHAPIRO AT  BREITBART PUT OUT TODAY, WHICH IS ONE OF THE FOREIGN FUNDERS  BEHIND SENATOR HAGEL THAT HE HAS  NOT YET DISCLOSED FORMALLY IS SOMETHING CALLED FRIENDS OF  HAMAS.
YOU KNOW I SAW THAT  INFORMATION TODAY, ALSO, AND  THAT IS MORE AND MORE  CONCERNING.
THERE WAS A REPORT THAT CAME  OUT LAST WEEK, NOT CONFIRMED  YET. BUT WE-- ALSO NOT DENYING IT  VERY VIGOROUSLY THAT ONE OF THE  GROUPS BEHIND THE SPEECHES MAY HAVE BEEN AN OUTFIT CALLED  FRIENDS OF HAMAS.
THAT HAS A RING TO IT. ZINT?
Stephen: OH, IT HAS A RING TO  IT. A RING THAT GOES SOMETHING LIKE  THIS:  AND FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FRIENDS OF HAMAS IS EVEN WORSE  THAN IT SOUNDS BECAUSE THIS  ORGANIZATION IS SO SINISTER THAT IT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST. [ LAUGHTER ] TURNS OUT, HAGEL'S LINK WITH  "FRIENDS OF HAMAS" GOES BACK TO  DAILY NEWS REPORTER DAN FRIEDMAN WHO ASKED A REPUBLICAN SENATE  AIDE LOOKING FOR DIRT IN HAGEL'S  PAST IF HAGEL HAD GIVEN A SPEECH TO THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF  HEZBOLLAH OR THE FRIENDS OF  HAMAS. ASSUMING THAT NO ONE COULD TAKE  SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT  ORGANIZATIONS WITH THOSE NAMES  EXISTED. [LAUGHTER] WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE IT  SERIOUSLY? I MEAN, IF THERE'S NO JUNIOR  LEAGUE OF HEZBOLLAH, WHO PUTS  OUT THE COOKBOOK OF BOMB  RECIPES? [LAUGHTER] BESIDES, THE FACT THAT THESE  ORGANIZATIONS DON'T EXIST ONLY  MAKES IT MORE SUSPICIOUS THAT CHUCK HAGEL HAS BEEN TIED TO  THEM. WHAT ELSE IS HE HIDING THAT  HASN'T HAPPENED? IS HE A MEMBER OF THE AL QAEDA  KIDZ CLUB? [LAUGHTER] WHAT ABOUT THE MUSLIM  BROTHERHOOD? OR THE MUSLIM SISTERHOOD OF THE  TRAVELING PANTS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHAT ABOUT NON-ISLAMIC  NON-EXISTENT GROUPS? HAS CHUCK HAGEL EVER GIVEN A  SPEECH TO COBRA? OR FOR THAT MATTER COBRA KAI? HAS HE RECEIVED DONATIONS FROM  THE LOLLIPOP GUILD? [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE HIS TIES TO THE DEAD  POET'S SOCIETY? AND WHY ARE THEY DEAD? DID THEY KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT  BENGHAZI? [LAUGHTER] PRESIDENT OBAMA, WITHDRAW  HAGEL'S NOMINATION, OR YOU WILL  LOSE THE SUPPORT OF MODERATE REPUBLICANS, ANOTHER  GROUP THAT DOESN'T EXIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT  SPORTS IS STADIUMS NAMED AFTER  CORPORATIONS. IT'S WIN-WIN. THE TEAMS GET MONEY, AND THE  CORPORATIONS GET ADVERTISING  THAT REALLY WORKS. I MEAN, GOING TO COORS FIELD  MAKES ME CRAVE THE SILVER  BULLET. AND ANY TIME I GO TO SEE THE  PATRIOTS PLAY AT GILLETTE  STADIUM, I'M AS HAIRLESS AS A NEWBORN MOLE RAT. [LAUGHTER] BUT I WAS ESPECIALLY PUMPED  ABOUT THE LATEST COMPANY TO GET  IN ON THE STADIUM NAMING ACTION.
AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS  FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY'S  FOOTBALL STADIUM HAS A NAME.
IT'S NAMED AFTER A PRISON  COMPANY. >>IT WILL BE CALLED GEO GROUP  STADIUM AFTER GET THIS THE  NATION'S LARGEST OPERATOR OF FOR PROFIT PRISONS. THEY MADE A $6 MILLION DONATION.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. A PRIVATE PRISON COMPANY IS  SPONSORING A SPORTS VENUE. IT'S LIKE BANK OF AMERICA  STADIUM ONLY THIS COMPANY  BELIEVES IN PUNISHMENT FOR  CRIME. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S ABOUT TIME! FOLKS --  IT'S ABOUT TIME WE STARTED  EMBRACING FORPROFIT  INCARCERTION. I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT OF  TAKING HOMICIDIAL MANIACS OFF  THE STREETS IF NO ONE'S MAKING COIN OFF IT? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, NAYSAYERS ARE IN A  SNIT JUST BECAUSE THE  GEO-GROUP'S PRISONS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF UNNECESSARY DEATHS OF  PEOPLE IN THEIR CUSTODY. THAT CHILDREN DETAINED IN ITS  FACILITIES SUFFERED CRUEL  TREATMENTS. AND THAT GEO GROUP'S  WALNUT  GROVE YOUTH CORRECTIONAL  FACILITY HAD A "PERVASIVE LEVEL OF BRAZEN STAFF SEXUAL  MISCONDUCT. BRAZEN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT? THAT'S A NATURAL FIT WITH  FOOTBALL. [LAUGHTER] THIS CRITICISM IS ONE OF THE  DOWNSIDES OF PAYING MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS TO HAVE PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR COMPANY. PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR  COMPANY. AND ASKING RIDICULOUS  INVASIVE QUESTIONS LIKE "SO THE  MONEY YOU'RE USING TO PAY FOR THESE NAMING RIGHTS ON A SCHOOL  BUILDING CAME FROM PROFITS YOU  MADE LOCKING UP CHILDREN AND OCCASIONALLY ABUSING THEM?"  WHILE IGNORING MORE IMPORTANT  QUESTIONS LIKE, "IS THE MONEY GREEN?"  WHRAF WHRAF. [LAUGHTER] BESIDES, FANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  LOVE "FREE HAT DAY."  THINK HOW MUCH THEY'LL  LOVE HOLDING SHARPENED SPOON "FREE SHIV MADE FROM A BROKEN  SPOON NIGHT." [LAUGHTER] PERSONALLY I THINK THEY LOVE  BROKEN SPOON NIGHT. SO I THINK AMERICA NEEDS MORE  INTERGRATION OF ATHLETICS AND  FOR-PROFIT PRIVATE INCACERATION. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, THE CHINESE ARE WAY  AHEAD OF US ON THIS. THEY HAVE ALREADY PERFECTED A  SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN GO TO  PRISON AND END UP PLAYING FOOTBALL-- FOREVER. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
