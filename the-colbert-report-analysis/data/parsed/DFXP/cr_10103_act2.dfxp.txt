(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT WON A PULITZER PRIZE FOR HIS REPORTING ON THE NSA BUT IT'S OUR DATA THEY STOLE. WHERE IS OUR PULITZER. PLEASE WELCOME GLENN GREENWALD. (APPLAUSE) I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME.
GOOD, GOOD.
Stephen: I GOT MY KNIVES OUT FOR YOU, MY MAN.
READY.
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE LION'S DEN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHO LOVE AMERICA WHO YOU ARE. AUTHOR OF THREE BEST SELLING BOOKS, YOU'VE WRITTEN FORTH "NEW YORK TIMES", L.A. TIMES AND THE GUARDIAN WHERE YOU ARE REPORTING ON THE NSA SCANDAL AND THE ED SNOWDEN LEAK. JUST WON THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE. (APPLAUSE) AND A POLK AWARD FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTING. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED NO PLACE TO HIDE, EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE NSA AND THE U.S. SURVEILLANCE STATE, ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO HIDE?
I'M NOT
Stephen: REALLY?
BUT IF I WERE, THERE WOULD BE NO ONE IN THIS SURVEILLANCE STATE, THE TITLE ACTUALLY COMES FROM FRANK CHURCH WHO INVESTIGATED THE SURVEILLANCE STATE IN THE MID 70s AND FOUND SOMETHING NOBODY KNEW WHICH IS THAT THE NSA WAS COLLECTING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF COMMUNICATIONS. AND WHAT HE SAID WAS THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS MACHINE THAT HAS BEEN BUILDING, IF IT EVER TURNED AROUND AND AIMED AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THERE WOULD BE NO PLACE TO HIDE. A VERY MAINSTREAM DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR 2 AND TO THAT'S THE TITLE OF THE BOOK BECAUSE THAT IS IN FACT WHAT HAPPENED IS THE NSA HAS TURNED THIS APPARATUS ON AMERICANS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE WORLD.
Stephen: BUT WE DID NOT KNOW THE EXTENT OF THAT UNTIL EDWARD SNOWDEN LEAKED. AND YOU PUBLISHED IT, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
Stephen: OKAY, SO UNTIL YOU TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING FOR ME TO BE BOTHERED ABOUT.
IT IS TRUE.
Stephen: AREN'T YOU KIND OF THE PROBLEM.
I AM, I DO PLEAD GUILTY. OF COURSE, IGNORANCE IS BLISS.
Stephen: YES!
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SO HAPPY, RIGHT.
Stephen: YES, EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BEAMING WITH JOY.
Stephen: I WILL FORGET EVERYTHING YOU SAID TO ME AS SOON AS YOU LEAVE THE STUDIO.
BUT THERE IS A REASON WHY JOURNALISM IS PROTECTIVE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT, AND IT IS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY IF PEOPLE IN POWER CAN HIDE FROM THOSE OVER WHOM THEY ARE RULING THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ACTS THEY ARE DOING AND THE POINT OF JOURNALISM IS TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THAT WHICH THEY ARE TRYING TO HIDE AND THAT IS WHAT WE DID.
Stephen: WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WHICH THEY DID USING YOUR FANCY WORDS. OKAY, ED SNOWDEN, ED SNOWDEN HAS REVEALED NATIONAL SECURITY SECRETS, HAS FLED THE COUNTRY, A TRAITER TO THE UNITED STATES. WHY SHOULD YOU NOT BE PROSECUTED FOR AIDING AND ABETTING AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES.
THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMEBODY COMES FORWARD IN AN ACT OF CONSCIENCE LIKE ELLSBERG DID IN '71 THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT WAS LYING TO THE POPULATION ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR AND EVERYONE SAID OR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID HE IS A TRAITER,.
Stephen: HE LOST THE VIETNAM WAR FOR US.
HE REVEALED THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT KNEW THAT IT WAS UNWINNABLE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY WERE TELLING THE POPULATION THAT THEY WERE WINNING IT.
Stephen: WE'LL NEVER KNOW NOW.
SO THAT'S THE PLAY BOOK.
Stephen: WE'LL NEVER KNOW. WE MIGHT HAVE WON IF HE HADN'T SAID THAT.
IT'S POSSIBLE.
Stephen: IT UNDERMINES THE CONFIDENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
WHEN THEY ARE DOING THINGS THAT DESERVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ACTIONS UNDERMINED, YEAH IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THAT TO BE REVEALED.
Stephen: NOW THIS SNOWDEN FELLOW, OKAY. HE FLED TO RUSSIA. DOES HE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THERE? BECAUSE IT'S A REGIME THAT IS TOTALLY OPEN AND FREE? (LAUGHTER) WAS MORDOR NOT ACCEPTING ASYLUM REQUESTS.
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY FLEE TO RUSSIA.
Stephen: HE FLED AND HE'S IN RUSSIA. CHECKMATE. DOW WANT TO SPIN THIS ONE. SPIN IT-- SPIN IT.
HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO LATIN AMERICA, HEADING THROUGH MOSCOW WHEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REVOKED HIS PASSPORT.
Stephen: IT IS EASY, PEOPLE GET LOST THAT WAY ALL THE TIME.
YOU JUST SKIP RIGHT OVER.
Stephen: THE POINT IS USING ASYLUM IS NOT TO DECLARE WHAT COUNTRY YOU LOVE THE MOST, IT'S TO GET PROTECTION FROM YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO PERSECUTE YOU SUCH AS PUTTING YOU IN PRISON FOR 40 YEARS FOR COMING FORWARD WITH INFORMATION THAT HIS FELLOW CITIZENS OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN.
Stephen: HIS FELLOW CITIZENS NEEDED TO KNOW THIS, THAT IS THE ARGUMENT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. HOW ABOUT THESE THINGS DID HIS FELLOW CITIZENS NEED TO KNOW WE WERE ALSO SPYING ON THE RUSSIAN AND CHINESE ARMY OR MEXICO OR THE AL QAEDA LINK ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ OR THE AFGHAN MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OR HASAN BULE WIFE WHO IS AN ASSOCIATE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, ALL THOSE THINGS WERE REVEALED AS WELL. HOW IS THAT NOT GIVEN AWAY AMERICAN STATE SECRETS OR DO YOU BELIEVE THERE SHOULD NO ESPIONAGE?
NO THERE SHOULD BE ESPIONAGE HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T REVEAL ANY OF THAT. WHAT HE DID WAS HE CAME TO NEWSPAPERS AND SAID I WANT YOU TO VET THIS INFORMATION AND DISCLOSE WHAT IT IS, THE PUBLIC OUGHT TO KNOW AND WITHHOLD THAT WHICH THEY SHOULD'NT. MOST OF THOSE-- MOST OF THOSE STORIES THAT YOU JUST REFERENCED WERE PUBLISHED BY THE NEWSPAPER CALLED "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FOR WHICH HE ACTUALLY GAVE NO DOCUMENTS.
Stephen: DON'T USE "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IN DEFENSE OF ME. YOU BELIEVE-- YOU BELIEVE THEY DID THE RIGHT THING BY PUBLISHING THAT.
I DO.
Stephen: YOU DO.
I DO.
Stephen: YOU BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES'S SECRETS OF OUR INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS SHOULD BE REVEALED.
THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS MATTER A GREAT DEAL.
Stephen: THESE AREN'T AMERICAN CITIZENS.
THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF NONAMERICANS, THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF-- .
Stephen: ITS PRIVACY RIGHTS OF NONAMERICANS DON'T HAVE PRIVACY RIGHTS.
THEY DO, DO, THEY DO.
Stephen: NO, THEY DON'T. IF THEY WANT PRIVACY RIGHTS THEY SHOULD BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS AND GIVE THEM UP.
THAT IS ONE THEORY. THE OTHER THEORY IS THAT THE INTERNET IS THIS GLOBAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND IF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS INVADING IT, TURNING IT INTO THIS MASS UBIQIOUTIOUS SYSTEM OF SURVEILLANCE WHICH THEY ARE DOING YOU REALLY CAN'T SEGREGATE WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO AMERICANS VERSUS NONAMERICANS IT MAKES THE INTERNET WEAKENED IT MAKES IT SO THAT ALL COMMUNICATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE ELECTRONICALLY OVER THE INTERNET ARE KNOWN TO THE NSA, COLLECTED, MONITORED AND STORED AND THAT IS WHAT SNOWDEN THINKS WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT AND I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WOULD SAY WE WOULD REMAIN BETTER OFF TO REMAIN IGNORANT OF WHAT OUR OWN GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO THE INTERNET.
Stephen: THESE ARE NOT ALL INTERNET.
THEY ARE TELEPHONE, INTERNET.
Stephen: TELEPHONE ISN'T INTERNET.
GOOD POINT.
Stephen: DID I JUST WIN THE ARGUMENT.
YOU WON THAT PART OF THE ARGUMENT.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CON GATTLATIONS.
Stephen: WHERE IS MY PULITZER? (LAUGHTER) HOLD ON ONE SECOND. WE'VE GOT TO GO TO A COMMERCIAL BREAK. BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE GLENN GREENWALD.
