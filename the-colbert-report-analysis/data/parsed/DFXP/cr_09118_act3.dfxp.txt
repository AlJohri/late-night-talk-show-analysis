Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  CALLED "FAR FROM THE TREE."  THE KINDLE EDITION HAS NEVER EVEN TOUCHED A TREE. PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW SOLOMON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ANDREW SOLOMON, THANKS FOR  COMING ON.
THANK YOU  Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SIR. YOU ARE A WRITER AND A LECTURER  ON POLITICS AND CULTURE AND  PSYCHOLOGY. THE AUTHOR OF THE NOON DAY DEEM  ONWHICH WON THE NATIONAL BOOK  AWARD. GOOD FOR YOU.
THANK YOU. Stephen: YOUR NEW BOOK IS  CALLED FAR FROM THE TREE. PARENTS, CHILDREN AND THE SEARCH  FOR IDENTITY. ALL RIGHT. WHO IS LOOKING FOR THEIR  IDENTITY HERE? THE PARENTS OR THE KIDS?
THEY'RE ALL LOOKING FOR THEIR  IDENTITY.
Stephen: BUT I'VE GOT KIDS. I KNOW WHO I AM. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT.
THE STORY OF THE BOOK IS THAT  PARENTS HAVE CHILDREN THINKING  WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IS REPRODUCE THEMSELVES
Stephen: IT'S CALLED  REPRODUCTION.
INDEED  Stephen: HAVE YOU TRIED IT? VERY GRATIFYING. I HAVE. YES, I HAVE. HIGHLY PLEASURABLE. BUT EVERYONE...
Stephen: GO AHEAD, YEAH. THE REALITY IS THAT YOU HAVE  KIDS, AND THEY TURN OUT TO BE  FULL OF SURPRISES AND FULL OF  DIFFERENCES. I HAVE YET TO MEET ANYONE WHO  HAS NOT OCCASIONALLY LOOKED AT  THEIR CHILD AND SAID, WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU  TALKING'.
THE QUESTION ALL PARENTS ASK  THEIR CHILDREN. I FIGURE OUT HOW PARENTS RESPOND  TO HAVING CHILDREN WHO ARE  DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT. PARENTS WITH DOWN SYNDROME OR  SCHIZOPHRENIA, PARENTS OF  CRIMINAL, PARENTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSGENDERED AND OF  PRODIGIES WHO ARE ALSO QUITE  OVERWHELMED
Stephen: YOU'RE DEALING WITH  SOME HEAVY STUFF IN THIS. YOU'RE DEALING WITH HEAVY STUFF.
BUT I HAVE TO SAY ALL OF  THESE STORIES WHICH APPEAR TO BE  SO FULL OF DARKNESS ENDED UP BEING STORIES THAT HAVE AN AWFUL  LOT OF LIGHT IN THEM
Stephen: A LOT OF HOPE IN  HERE AND THERE ARE PARENTS  RESPONDING IN REALLY BEAUTIFUL WAYS TO THE CHALLENGES POSED BY  CHILDREN THEY DIDN'T EXPECT. HIDING IT FROM MY KIDS SO THEY  DON'T SEE WHAT THE STANDARD IS.
I'M HIDING IT FROM MY KIDS  TOO
Stephen: WHY DO YOU SAY  EXCEPTIONAL? WHY EXCEPTIONAL? SOME OF THESE KIDS YOU WOULD  HAVE JUST CALLED SPECIAL. OF.
WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH  TERMS ALL THE TIME TO DEFINE  THEM. WHAT IS THE WORD THAT CONVEYS  BOTH THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT  AND NOT WHAT I WANTED AND THIS BECAME THE JOY OF MY LIFE.
Stephen: WERE YOU AN  EXCEPTIONAL CHILD?
I AM. Stephen: ARE YOU A  SCHIZOPHRENIC OR ANYTHING LIKE  THAT? I SEE NO OBVIOUS EXCEPTION.
SCHIZOPHRENIA HASN'T SURFACED  YET BUT I'M THE GAY CHILD OF  STRAIGHT PARENTS. THAT THREW UP SOME CHALLENGES  FOR MY PARENTS. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A KID AND  WE WENT TO A SHOE STORE AND THE  SALESMAN SAID AT THE END OF OUR LITTLE TALK THAT MY BROTHER AND  I COULD EACH HAVE A BALLOON. MY BROTHER WANTED A RED BALLOON  AND I WANTED A PINK BALLOON. MY MOTHER SAID I THINK YOU'D  REALLY RATHER HAVE A BLUE  BALLOON. I SAID I WANTED THE PINK ONE. SHE SAID THAT MY FAVORITE COLOR  WAS BLUE. NOW MY FAVORITE COLOR IS BLUE  AND I'M STILL GAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: PEOPLE WHO HAVE  EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN SOMETIMES  SAY TO PEOPLE WHO JUST HAD EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN WELCOME TO  HOLLAND. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
THERE'S AN ESSAY WRITTEN BY A  WRITER FOR SESAME STREET IN  WHICH SHE SAID THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING A DISABLED  CHILD IS LIKE PLANNING A TRIP TO  ITALY, LEARNING THE LANGUAGE, GETTING THE GUIDE BOOKS, MAKING  THE RESERVATIONS GETTING ON THE  PLANE AND BEING TOLD WE'RE LANDING IN HOLLAND. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DUTCH AREN'T  SO CRAZY ABOUT THIS COMPARISON. BUT HER IDEA...
Stephen: THEY'RE SO... THEY'RE EXCEPTIONAL THIS THEIR  OWN WAY.
EXACTLY. Stephen: SO YOU GO TO HOLLAND  AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
IT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAYS. YOU GET TO HOLLAND AND THINK I  WANT TO GO TO ITALY. ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GOING TO  ITALY. BUT YOU HAVEN'T LANDED IN A  TERRIBLE PLACE. YOU'VE LANDED IN A COUNTRY THAT  HAS TULIPS AND WINDMILLS. IT EVEN HAS RECOMMEND BRANTS. SHE SAID THE EXPERIENCE OF  HAVING A DISABLED CHILD IS NOT  WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR BUT IT IS ULTIMATELY SOMETHING IN WHICH  THERE ARE REWARDS. I WOULD THINK OF SOMEONE I GOT  TO KNOW WHO SAID THE ENTERMENT  OF A SON WHO HAD DIED  TRAGICALLY. LET ME BURY HERE THE RAGE I FEEL  TO HAVE BEEN TWICE ROBBED ONCE  AS A CHILD I WANTED AND ONCE THE SON I LOVE.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU. Stephen: THE BOOK IS "FAR  FROM THE TREE."  ANDREW SOLOMON. WE'LL BE RIGHT
