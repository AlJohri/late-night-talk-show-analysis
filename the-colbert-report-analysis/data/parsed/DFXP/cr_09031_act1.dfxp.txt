Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL COME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US,  LADY ITS AND GENTLEMEN, LET  ME BEGIN BY SAYING ELLEN  SILLA LUMEN OMENTIELVO. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I SLIPPED IN A  LITTLE QUENYA THERE, I'M  JUST SO PUMPED ABOUT THE NEW HOBBIT MOVIE ABOUT THAT  HOBBIT, THE HOBBIT. HOBBIT, HOBBIT, HOBBIT. YOU EVER SAY A WORD SO PAIN  TIMES IT SOUNDS LIKE  SOMEBODY JUST MADE IT UP? ANYWAY, THIS THURSDAY IS THE  NEW YORK PREMIER OF PETER  JACKSON'S J.R.R. TOLKIEN THE HOBBIT PART ONE, AN  UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, TOKYO  DRIFT. (LAUGHTER)  AND THIS WEEK WE GOT ALL THE  BIG STARS. SIR IAN McKELLEN, GANDALF  THE GREY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE GOT SIR MARTIN FREEMAN,  BILBO BAGGINS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SIR PETER JACKSON WHO PLAYED  A VERY CONVINCING FILM  DIRECTOR. AND SIR ANDY SERKIS WHO IS  EITHER THE MAN WHO PLAYED  CAESAR IN RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APRILS OR HE IS A  SUPERCHIMP WHO PLAYS THIS  MAN. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  AND WE HAVE GOT FOR YOUR  PLEASURE WE'VE GOT AN EVEN  BIGGER TOLKIEN NAME LINED UP TO HOST OUR HOBBIT WEEK, ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AS PETER JACKSON HIMSELF  SAID OF ME IN ENTERTAINMENT  WEEKLY, QUOTE, I HAVE NEVER MET A BIGGER TOLKIEN GEEK IN  MY LIFE. YOU HEAR THAT? YOU HEAR THAT GIRLS FROM  MIDDLE SCHOOL? I'M NOT A GEEK. I'M KING GEEK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU JUST, BUD HEEE JUST  HANDLING THERE FOR ANOTHER  FIVE YEARS. YOU WANT A PAYOFF? OF COURSE ONCE IT GOT OUT ON  THE INTERNET THAT I HAD  VISITED THE SET OF THE  HOBBIT NEW ZEALAND LAST YEAR IT TOUCHED OFF A FIRESTORM  IN THE MEDIA ABOUT MY  POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN THE  MOVIE. STARTED WITH THE CHRISTIAN  SCIENCE UPON TER'S INNOCENT  QUESTION, WILL STEPHEN  COLBERT APPEAR IN THE HOBBIT? FOLLOWED BY "THE HOLLYWOOD  REPORTER" AS STEPHEN COLBERT  TO MAKE CAMEO IN THE HOBBIT. AND THEN THE BOMBSHELL  EXAMINER HEADLINE, THE  HOBBIT MOVIE NEWS STEPHEN  COLBERT TO STAR IN LORD OF THE RINGS PREQUEL. I HAVE TO SAY-- I HAVE TO  SAY THAT WAS AN EXCITING AND  UNVERIFIED ESCALATION OF MY  CAREER. BUT IS ANY OF IT TRUE? WELL, MY LIPS ARE SEALED. BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS: IF  I DID NOT APPEAR IN THE  HOBBIT TRILOGY, WHY DO I  HAVE THE ELVISH BLADE  STRING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ONE OF THE ORIGINAL STINGS  USED IN THE LORD OF THE RING  THE TRILOGY, WHERE DID I GET T FIND IT IN A MOUNTAIN  TROLL CAVE OR IS IT JUST  SOME PROP. OH NO, THIS WAS MADE IN  GONDOLIN BEFORE THE FALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NATION, I LOVE NEW YORK  CITY. THE BIG APPLE, THE CITY THAT  NEVER SLEEPS, RAT XANADU. SO I WAS CRUSHED TO LEARN  THE METROPOLIS I KNOW AND  LOVE HAS CHANGED, NOT ONE  PERSON WAS MURDERED IN NEW YORK CITY ON MONDAY. NYPD DEPUTY COMMISSIONER  PAUL BROWN COULDN'T EVEN  REMEMBER THE LAST TIME A DAY  WENT BY WHERE NOT ONE PERSON WAS SHOT, STABBED OR SLASHED. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENED? I REMEMBER THE REAL NEW YORK  OF THE '80s, WHEN IN A  SINGLE NIGHT YOU COULD SCORE SOME WEED, CATCH A TIMES  SQUARE PORNO AND THEN GET  STABBED IN THE NECK BY A  COKED-UP LOU REED. AND THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD  FIRST DATEMENT NOW TIMES  SQUARE HAS BECOME A DISNEY  BUBBA GUMP WIMP COMPANY. THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN  IS ONE OF THOSE GIANT M & Ms  TRIES TO FLASH YOU ITS  PEANUT. WHERE IS THE THRILLING  DANGEROUS CITY OF MIDNIGHT  COWBOY OR TAXI DRIVER?
YOU TALKING TO ME?
Stephen: I WISH I WAS  TALKING TO YOU. (LAUGHTER)  INSTEAD OF I'M TALKING TO  HER. SUPERCALIFRAGISLISTICEXPIALI  -- SUPERCALIFRAGISLISTICEXPIALI [BLEEP] ME. FOLK, I'VE HAD IT, HAD IT. THIS DISTURBING LACK OF  VIOLENCE IS NOT JUST A  PROBLEM FOR OUR CITY T IS A  PROBLEM FOR THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY. IN THIS LAST ELECTION THEY  LOST THE BLACKS. THEY LOST THE WOMEN, THEY  LOST YOUNG VOTERS. THEY LOST LATINOS BY 44%. EVEN MORE SURPRISING THEY  FAILED IT TO GET 100% OF THE  WHITE MALE VOTE. BUT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO  TURN THE VOTER TIDE IN THE  GOP'S FAVOR AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BASE INSTINCT. NOW, FOLK, THE CLIMBING  STREET VIOLENCE MAY SEEM  LIKE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT  TO SOME. BUT AS "THE WASHINGTON POST"  CHARLES LANE RECENTLY WROTE  FEAR OF STREET CRIME ONCE CONVERTED MANY A WHITE  WORKING CLASS DEMOCRAT INTO  A REPUBLICAN. BUT SAFER STREETS HAVE NOW  BLUNTED WHAT WAS ONCE A  SHARP WEDGE ISSUE. AND FOLKS, WITHOUT CRIME THE  GOP'S ONLY REMAINING WEDGE  ISSUES ARE GAY MARRIAGE, IMMIGRATION, FLAG BURNING,  VOTER FRAUD, WELFARE, GUN  CONTROL AND OF COURSE  CONTRACEPTION. NOW IN THE GOOD OLD--   (LAUGHTER)  IN THE GOOD OLD BAD DAYS OF  THE '80s REPUBLICANS COULD TURN OUT THE SUBURBAN WHITE  VOTE SIMPLY BY SHOWING  IMAGES OF SCARY GUYS LIKE  WILLIE HORTON BEING ALLOWED TO GO IN AND OUT OF PRISON. TO THIS DAY I'M TERRIFIED TO  GO THROUGH A REVOLVING DOOR. (LAUGHTER)  NOW GETTING-- TOUGH ON CRIME  WAS A KEY CONSERVATIVE ISSUE  THAT IS GONE. AND WORSE, IT'S THE  CONSERVATIVE'S OWN DAMN  FAULT. TAKE RUDY GIULIANI. THE REPUBLICAN TOUGH ON  CRIME NEW YORK MAYOR WHO  CRACKED DOWN ON TURNSTILE  JUMPERS, BROKEN WINDOWS AND SQUEEGEE GUYS. SQUEEGEE GUYS WITHOUT  CURIOUSLY DISAPPEARED RIGHT  BEFORE THE OPENING OF NEW  YORK'S BODY EXHIBITS. (LAUGHTER)  UNFORTUNATELY, UNFORTUNATELY  IT, WITHOUTED TOO WELL. NOW THE RIGHT IS BEING  PUNISHED FOR ITS OWN  SUCCESS. LIKE DENTISTS WHO GAVE US  FLUORIDE AND TO YOU DON'T  HAVE CAVITIES TO FILL OR MY TEACH A MAN TO FISH SEAFOOD  RESTAURANT. NO ONE EVER COMES BACK. WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING  TO SCARE WHITE VOTERS INTO  VOTING REPUBLICAN. SO TONIGHT--   (LAUGHTER)
TONIGHT, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, I AM CALLING ON  ALL OF AMERICA'S  DISENFRANCHISED MINORITIES TO VIOLENTLY RISE UP AGAINST  THE WHITE MALE PATRIARCHY  THAT IS KEEPING YOU DOWN. IT IS TIME TO STICK IT TO  THE MAN. AND I SHOULD KNOW, I'M THE  MAN. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN LOOK-- LOOK-- LOOK AT  EVERYTHING I HAVE. YOU SEE THIS iPAD? SEE THIS iPAD RIGHT HERE, I  GOT IT FOR FREE. AND MY FREE iPAD HAS ITS OWN  FREE MINIiPAD WHICH HAS ITS  OWN FREE iPHONE 5, WHICH HAS A FREE NANO, WHICH HAS ITS  OWN FREE SHUFFLE. I CAN AFFORD ALL THIS BUT I  DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. DOESN'T THAT JUST MAKE YOU  WANT TO BLUFERJON ME WITH A  CHAIR LEG UNTIL I BURST OPEN LIKE A CASH PINATA? MEANWHILE--   (APPLAUSE)  MEANWHILE DOWN TRODEN, YOUR  FUTURE PROSPECTS ARE PRETTY  DIM. I MEAN HAVE YOU HEARD THE  COMING CUTS TO PUBLIC  EDUCATION OR FOOD STAMPS? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE  CUTS TO MEDICAID? AND FOLKS, LET ME TELL YOU,  THE RICH JUST GET RICHER. SO REALLY MUGGING AN OLD  COUPLE OUTSIDE THE  OPERAHOUSE IS A FORM OF  JUSTICE. I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT--   (LAUGHTER)  ULTIMATELY ALL OF IN IS  SOCIETY'S FAULT AND I SAY IT'S PAY BACK TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT PUT YOU  IN THE MIND-SET FOR MAYHEM? NICE BIG BAG OF METH. HMMMM, SOME OF THE TASTY  BLUE, GO NUTS. TWEAK OUT. TORCH A MALL FOOD COURT. SO ON BEHALF, ON BEHALF OF  ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, PLEASE DO  SOMETHING FRIGHTENING BETWEEN NOW AND THE MIDTERM  ELECTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU DO  NOT, THE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TRULY  TERRIFYING LIKE ADDRESSING  THE NEEDS OF BLACKS, WOMEN AND HISPANICS. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
