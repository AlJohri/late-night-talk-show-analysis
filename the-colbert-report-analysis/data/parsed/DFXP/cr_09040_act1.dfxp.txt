Stephen: TONIGHT, SCIENCE  FINDS THE KEY TO A LONG, HEALTHY  LIFE. WHATEVER IT IS, I BET IT TASTES  GOOD FRIED. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, CONTROVERSY OVER THE NEW  BIN LADEN FILM. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE LET HIM DO  HIS OWN SINGING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY GUEST, CHRIS KLUWE, IS AN  NFL PUNTER AND GAY RIGHTS  ADVOCATE. WOW, PRETTY BRAVE FOR AN NFL  PLAYER TO ADMIT HE'S A PUNTER. [ LAUGHTER ] JIMMY KIMMEL STARTS IN HIS NEW  11:35 TIME SLOT TONIGHT. BUT SINCE HE'S MY DIRECT  COMPETITION, I REFUSE TO MENTION  HIM. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. [CROWD CHANTING SEE STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT, FOLKS. I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND  I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING  ME IN HERE, OUT THERE NATION, WE ALL KNOW THE  ECONOMY'S NOT IN GREAT SHAPE. JUST TODAY THE DOW DROPPED FIFTY  FIVE-- OF WHATEVER IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ] DOW-LERS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT ONE  OF MY INVESTMENTS SKYROCKETED IN  VALUE TODAY.
FOREVER IS GOING TO COST YOU  MORE, AND BY FOREVER I MEAN  UNITED STATES POST OFFICE'S FOREVER STAMP. COME JANUARY 27, IT GOES UP BY  ONE CENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: FOLKS, I DON'T WANNA  BRAG BUT BACK IN 2007, I BOUGHT  DOZENS OF FOREVER STAMPS WHEN THEY WERE STILL 41 CENTS A POP. NOW THEY'RE 46 CENTS. GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH THAT'S WORTH. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERY TIME I SEND A LETTER,  THAT'S PURE PROFIT! EVERY SECOND I'M NOT LICKIN',  I'M LOSING MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AS SMART AN INVESTMENT AS  THIS WAS, IT JUST PROVES THE  GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO ANYTHING  RIGHT. THIS PRICE HIKE IS AN OUTRAGE. A PENNY?! LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, POST  OFFICE. I PUT A LETTER LIKE THIS IN A  METAL BOX ON ANY STREET CORNER  IN, SAY, MIAMI AND WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS IT'S DELIVERED IN  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. AND FOR THAT YOU WANT 46 CENTS? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GO TO HELL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT -- WHAT? WHAT AM I, MADE OF CENTS? WHAT'S NEXT? 47 CENTS?! THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT'S AFTER  THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL SCREW THE POST OFFICE. AT THIS PRICE, I'LL DELIVER MY  OWN LETTERS, THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] NOTE TO SELF, CHECK ORBITZ FOR  FLIGHTS TO EVERYWHERE. [ LAUGHTER ] NATION, THEY SAY AN APPLE A DAY  KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY. THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR, I BOUGHT  365 iPHONES. THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH  DR. STEPHEN T. COLBERT, DFA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] QUICK DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A  MEDICAL DOCTOR. I'M AN HONORARY DOCTOR OF FINE  ARTS, SO MOST OF MY PATIENTS DO  A PRETTY GOOD IMPRESSION OF "THE SCREAM."  AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH IS  BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT  PHARMACEUTICALS. PRESCOTT: SEE WHAT EVERYONE'S  SUING ABOUT! [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST UP, AGING.
OLD!
Stephen: THANKS. FOLKS, WE'RE ALL SEARCHING FOR  THE SECRET TO LONGEVITY. ME, I'M NOT WORRIED. BECAUSE ACCORDING MY MEDICAL  HISTORY, I'VE BEEN ALIVE EVERY  DAY OF MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO PROJECT THAT FORWARD, AND I  WILL NEVER DIE. THAT'S MATH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FOLKS, THERE IS NEW EVIDENCE  THAT THE STEPHEN COLBERT  LIFESTYLE WILL ENSURE YEARS FROM NOW YOU WILL BE SITTING PRETTY,  ENJOYING FREE FOOD AT ALL YOUR  FRIENDS' FUNERALS. [ LAUGHTER ] JIM?
CAN LOSING YOUR COOL ACTUALLY  BE GOOD FOR YOU? A NEW GERMAN STUDY FOUND PEOPLE  WHO EXPRESS THEIR ANGER LIVE TWO  YEARS LONGER ON AVERAGE THAN THOSE WHO BOTTLE UP THEIR RAGE.
Stephen: YES, A GERMAN STUDY  FOUND THAT EXPRESSING ANGER  LEADS TO A LONGER LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] ALTHOUGH, WHEN GERMANS EXPRESS  THEIR ANGER, OTHERS TEND TO LIVE  SHORTER LIVES. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, I'VE LONG KNOWN RAGE WAS  A LIFE SAVER. I LEARNED IT FROM MY MENTOR RUSH  LIMBAUGH BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU  LOOK AT HIM YOU GOTTA ASK, "HOW IS HE STILL ALIVE?" [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE IS  NATURALLY BLESSED WITH  SOUL-CHOKING BITTERNESS. LUCKILY, THE GOOD FOLKS AT  PRESCOTT HAVE AN EXCITING WAY TO  INDUCE RAGE IN THE TERMINALLY CALM. INTRODUCING: VACSA-TERNITY  A WONDER PILL THAT WILL ADD  YEARS TO YOUR LIFE IN A SINGLE  DOSE. NOW, TO ACCESS THE  LIFE-EXTENDING CAPSULE SIMPLY  TAKE THE PLASTIC OFF THE -- [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK I (bleep) CHIPPED MY  TOOTH. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. THAT COMES UP, ALL RIGHT. LIKE THAT. OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. -- OKAY NOW, SIMPLY THE -- [ LAUGHTER ] [  APPLAUSE  ] SIMPLY,  PRESS CAP UPWARDS WHILE  UNDERTURNING FLAP B. INSERT PHILLIPS HEAD ALLEN  WRENCH-- NOT INCLUDED-- AND TURN  INTRA-CLOCKWISE WITH LESS THAN TWO POUNDS OF (bleep). OPEN UP. GIVE ME MY PILLS! [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-TERNITY  INCLUDE: ABDOMINAL FOOSBALL,  ELBOW-BAGGINS, AND THE HUMPTY  HUMP. A. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, IF YOU USE  VACSA-TERNITY AND LIVE FOREVER,  YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A STRONG BODY AND A SHARP MIND! SO, OUR NEXT SUBJECT: AGING.
OLD! [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: THAT IS STRANGELY  FAMILIAR. [ LAUGHTER ] MAN HAS LONG SEARCHED FOR THE  FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. WE'VE TRIED IT ALL:  POTIONS,  PLASTIC SURGERY, WATCHING  "BENJAMIN BUTTON" WHILE STANDING NEXT TO A MICROWAVE. IT'S GOTTA DO SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, THERE'S NEW HOPE THAT WE  CAN TURN BACK THE CLOCK.
SCIENTISTS NOW THINK THAT  THEY FOUND HOW TO REVERSE  EFFECTS OF AGING. ACCORDING TO STANFORD  UNIVERSITY, IF YOU GET A BLOOD  TRANSFUSION FROM SOMEONE YOUNGER IT COULD HELP IMPROVE LEARNING  AND MEMORY.
Stephen: YES, THE BLOOD OF  THE YOUNG CAN HELP IMPROVE YOUR  MEMORY, ALTHOUGH YOU WILL REMEMBER ONLY XBOX CHEAT CODES  AND TAYLOR SWIFT'S  EX-BOYFRIENDS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, THE STUDY'S AUTHOR, DOCTOR  SAUL VILLEDA, CONNECTED THE  CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF OLD AND YOUNG MICE SO THEIR BLOOD COULD  MINGLE, RESULTING IN A 20%  INCREASE IN CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BRAIN CELLS FOR THE OLD MICES. ALSO KNOWN AS THE WORLD'S MOST  DISTURBING EPISODE OF PINKY AND  THE BRAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] APPARENTLY ABSORBING THE BLOOD  OF THE YOUNG CAN REVERSE THE  EFFECTS OF AGING. WHICH IS GREAT NEWS, OTHERWISE I  WOULD HAVE TO RESORT TO  SOMETHING DISTURBING, LIKE  EXERCISE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, IN LIGHT OF THIS  BREAKTHROUGH, PRESCOTT IS PROUD  TO INTRODUCE VACSA-TERN A MEDICAL-GRADE YOUNG PERSON  HARVESTED STRAIGHT FROM MY  INTERN PROGRAM. [ LAUGHTER ] NICE TO MEET YOU, VACSA-TERN.
IT'S JAY.
Stephen: SHHH. NO NAMES. MAKES IT CREEPY. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. JUST FIND THE PRE-INSTALLED  SPIGOT ON THE INTERN'S BACK. AND FILL 'ER UP WITH YOUNG! MMMMM, MMMMM. [ LAUGHTER ] WANNA GO SKATEBOARDING! LOLS! TWITTER! SKINNY JEANS! [ LAUGHTER ] HOW YOU FEELING, JAY?
NO ONE EVER CALLS ME! WHERE ARE MY GLASSES? HISPANIC PEOPLE STEAL! [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: QUIET, GRANDPA! YOU'RE HARSHING MY BLOOD BUZZ. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN GO NOW. BUT STAY CLOSE, JAY. I'M SO THIRSTY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-TERN  INCLUDE TONGUE DEPRESSION,  INTERCRANIAL NOUGAT, AND  CRAFTMATIC ADJUSTABLE HEAD. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S IT FOR CHEATING DEATH,  BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT  PHARMACEUTICALS. REMEMBER OUR MOTTO: ONE MAN'S  MEDICAL MALPRACTICE IS ANOTHER  MAN'S FREE ANATOMICAL SKELETON! UNTIL NEXT TIME, I'LL SEE YOU IN  HEALTH!
