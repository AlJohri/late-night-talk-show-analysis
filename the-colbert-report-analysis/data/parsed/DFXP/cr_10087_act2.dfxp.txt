Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, PRIMARY SEASON IS UPON US AND I COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED. FINALLY A CHANCE TO SEE SOME FRESH NEW FACES BEING BANKROLLED BY THE SAME OLD FACES. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, NO FACE NEEDS FRESHENING MORE THAN MITCH McCONNELL. I HAVE RECENTLY ALWAYS BEEN OPPOSED TO MITCH McCONNELL. HE CLAIMS TO BE A SMALL GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE, YET HE WORKS FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE, PICK A SIDE, SIR, THANKFULLY McCONNELL IS FACING A STRONG PRIMARY CHALLENGE FROM KENTUCKY TEA PARTY DARLING MATT BEVIN, THIS WILL BE HIS CLOSEST RACE SINCE HE BEAT THAT HAIR. BUT NOW, BUT NOW THE LIBERAL, YOU ALL KNOW-- THE LIBERAL KENTUCKY MEDIA IS GOING AFTER MY MAN BEVIN JUST BECAUSE HE SPOKE AT A COCKFIGHTING RALLY. FOLKS, THAT'S JUST GOOD POLITICS. A CANDIDATE HAS TO REACH ALL CONSTITUENCIES. SOCCER MOMS, COCKFIGHTING DADS, BEAR BAITING UNCLES, HORSEWHIPPING SISTERS IN LAW, AND PERSONALLY I WAS THRILLED WHEN I HEARD ABOUT BEVIN'S CONNECTION TO GAMECOCKERY. LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THE REPORT KNOW SOMETHING KNOW I'M SOMETHING OF A COCK-THUSIAST. THERE IS NO GREATER RUSH THAN WATCHING A FILIPINO BLUE FACE GO BEAK TO BEAK WITH A CHINESE SILKE, THE SMELL OF THE DUST, THE GLEAM OF THE BLADE, THE CALL OF PEPE THE TOOTHLESS BOOKIE. IT IS THE SWEET SCIENCE FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY THE SAVORY SOUP. BUT APPARENTLY, AND I DID NOT KNOW THIS, SOME SO-CALLED AMERICANS OPPOSE MAKING ROOSTERS FIGHT TO THE DEATH. THEY PREFER THEIR POULTRY TO BE HUMANELY CRAMMED INTO A CRATE AND COMPASSIONATELY BEHEADED BY A HOMICIDAL CONVEYER BELT. SO NOW ATTACK CHICKENS ARE CIRCLING MATT BEVIN WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY CALLING FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE RACE. THANKFULLY, BEVIN HAS A PERFECTLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY HE SPOKE AT THE COCKFIGHTING RALLY. HE DID NOT REALIZE THE EVENT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH COCKFIGHTING. I MEAN HOW-- HOW COULD HE! HOW COULD HE KNOW THE EVENT WAS HOSTED BY THE AMERICAN GAMEFOUL DEFENSE NETWORK. THAT NAME COULD MEAN ANYTHING. I MEAN IT COULD BE ABOUT GIVING ASSAULT RIFLES TO ROOSTERS. I WOULD PAY TO SEE THAT. AND AS BEVIN POINTED OUT, LIFE ON THE TRAIL MOVES TOO FAST TO NOTICE DETAILS LIKE WHO YOU ARE TALKING TO. JIM?
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO SPEAK AND THEN I HAD TO BOOGIE BECAUSE I HAD TO GET TO OWENSBORO WHERE I WAS ALSO SPEAKING AT AN UNBRIDLED LIBERTY RALLY.
Stephen: YES, HE'S MOVING ALL OVER THE STATE, SPEAKING HERE, SPEAKING THERE, HIS HANDLERS DRIVE HIM AROUND IN A WINDOWLESS VAN WITH A BAG ON HIS HEAD AND WHIP IT OFF AND HE JUST GOES FOR IT LIBERTY, AND THEN BACK IN THE BAG. AND--  (APPLAUSE)
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE TEA PARTY, BEVIN WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THE REPUGNANT PRACTICE OF COCKFIGHTING WHICH HE IN NO WAY CONDONES IS ALSO A PROUD AMERICAN TRADITION.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT COCKFIGHTING AND DOGFIGHTING AS WELL. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING NEW. THE FOUNDING FATHERS WERE ALL, MANY OF THEM ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
Stephen: YES. THEY ALL, THEY WERE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN COCKFIGHTING AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. WHICH MEANS THERE MUST BE COCKFIGHTING IN HEAVEN. THOUGH TECHNICALLY THEY STRAP SPURS ON THE ANGELS AND MAKE THEM GO AT IT. THE POINT IS, OUR FOUNDERS DID IT. IT IS OUR HERITAGE. AND SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY. THE SAME REASON WE SHOULD ALL BE DUALING WITH PISTOLS AND BONING OUR SLAVES. SO LAYOFF MATT BEVIN. HE DOES NOT CONDONE IT BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO HOLD A RALLY TO SUPPORT COCKFIGHTING, HE WILL BE THERE AND NOT KNOW WHY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
