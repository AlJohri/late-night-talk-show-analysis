(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT.
STEPHEN, STEPH    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU  WITH US, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, IT IS NO SECRET, IT  IS ABSOLUTELY NO SECRET WHY  THERE IS ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR TONIGHT. NATION, IT IS ELECTION EVE. JUST HOURS LEFT IN THE 2012  CAMPAIGN. BOTH CAMP DATS-- CAN DATS  ARE PULLING OUT ALL THE  STOPS.
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT'S  FINAL TWO DAY, FLORIDA, NEW  HAMPSHIRE, COLORADO, OHIO, WISCONSIN AND EYE WATCH. LET ME SHOW YOU THE MITT  ROMNEY SCHEDULE. HE'S TRYING TO GO INTO  PENNSYLVANIA. IT'S FLORIDA, IT'S VIRGINIA,  IT'S NEW HAMPSHIRE.
Stephen: SO IF YOU LIVE  IN ONE OF THESE STATES, "THE  COLBERT REPORT" IS NOW ISSUING A SEVERE CANDIDATE  WARNING. BE PREPARED WITH FRESH WATER  AND FLASHLIGHTS AND PLEASE,  IF YOU HAVE A SINGLE WORKING CLASS FEMALE SUBURBAN  UNDECIDED VOTE NEVER YOUR  HOME, COVER HER WITH PLYWOOD. OR SHE COULD JUST GET SUKD  UP INTO A VORTEX OF  PANDERING. NOW FOLKS, OVER A YEAR AGO I  PROMISED TO MAKE YOU A  PLAYER IN THIS ELECTION  THANKS TO COLBERT SUPER PAC. YOU KNOW OUR MOTTO, MAKING A  BETTER TOMORROW --
TOMORROW!
Stephen: I REMEMBER WHEN  I CAME UP WITH THAT SLOGAN. SEEMS JUST LIKE YESTERDAY,  YESTERDAY. IF ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A  LITTLE PROOF OF JUST HOW  INFLUENTIAL WE HAVE BEEN IN  THIS ELECTION, WELL, LISTEN MITT ROMNEY TODAY. GIVING HIS CLOSING ARGUMENTS.
YOUR WORK IS MAKING A  DIFFERENCE. THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ARE  WATCHING. THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA ARE  WATCHING. WE COULD BEGIN A BETTER  TOMORROW TOMORROW.
Stephen: HE USED OUR  SLOGAN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I LOVE YOU! FOLKS, I THINK-- I THINK  THAT PROVES THAT M ITT IS A  CANDIDATE JUST AS SERIOUS  AND SINCERE AS I AM. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN MY WORDS, HIS MOUTH. I FEEL LIKE I'M A  BILLIONAIRE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW OF COURSE THAT DOES NOT  MEAN THAT MITT'S CAMPAIGN  AND MY SUPER PAC ARE COORDINATING IN ANYWAY. IN FACT, I HAVE NO OFFICIAL  RELATIONSHIP TO EITHER  CAMPAIGN. I HAVEN'T EVEN SIGNED UP FOR  ANY OF THEIR E-MAILS BUT  SOMEHOW AND THIS IS TRUE, LAST WEEK THE OBAMA PEOPLE  JUST FOUND ME. AND HAVE BEEN SENDING ME  E-MAILS. OF COURSE IT JUST STARTED  LAST WEEK SO I'VE ONLY  RECEIVED 600 OF THEM. (LAUGHTER)  BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS  FROM LITERARY LEGEND AND  ONLY POET YOU EVER HEARD OF MAYA ANGELOU. MAYA WROTE-- GO! RISE UP. AND LET YOUR FRIENDS AND  FAMILY IN EARLY VOTING  STATES. GO WHERE THEY CAN GO TODAY. WE MUST MAKE OUR VOICES  HEARD. (APPLAUSE)  I KNOW WHY THE CAGE  BIRD-- NO DOUBT THE GOP IS  SENDING OUT E-MAILS FROM ROMNEY POTE LAUREATE KID  ROCK. SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF  WATERER TO WATER, BANG A  DANG DIGGY DIGGY DIGGY TAX  CUTS! FUN FACT, LIKE THE OTHER  KIDS WHO SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY,  KID ROCK IS 41. (LAUGHTER)  BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE MAKING A  HUGE PUSH, FOLKS, BECAUSE  THEY KNOW IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ONE THING,.
IS IT ALL GOING TO BE  ABOUT VOTER TURNOUT.
YES, HERE AND IN MOST OF  THE OTHER BATTLEGROUND  STATE.
VOTER TURNOUT IS GOING TO  MEAN EVERYTHING.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO  TURNOUT IN THESE FINAL  HOURS.
IT REALLY ALL BOILS DOWN  TO HOW MANY VOTERS TURN OUT.
Stephen: THERE IS A LOT  OF TECHNICAL JARGON IN  THERE. LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOUR. THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS MORE  VOTERS IS GOING TO WIN. (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS THE BEST ANALYSIS  CABLE NEWS HAS DONE SINCE  THE 6 PART CNN SERIES BEARS, DO THEY [BLEEP] IN THE  WOODS. (APPLAUSE)  TURNS OUT, TURN OUT-- TURN  OUT THE VOTE IS PARTICULARLY  CRUCIAL FOR OBAMA BECAUSE WHILE POLLS SHOW HIM AHEAD  OF MITT ROMNEY AMONG  REGISTERED VOTERS, AMONG  LIKELY VOTERS THEY'RE TIED. ALTHOUGH AMONG UNLIKELY  VOTERS THEY'RE BOTH BEING  BEATEN BY A HONEY BOO BOO  MARATHON. NOW OT BAMA CAMPAIGN NEEDS  TO GET THOSE REGISTERED  VOTERS TO BECOME LIKELY  VOTERS. AND FOLKS, THEY HAVE A  SECRET WEAPON TO DO IT. ACCORDING TO A "THE NEW  YORKER" ARTICLE ON THE OBAMA  CAMPAIGN, THE BEST WAY TO  MOBILIZE VOTERS, THEY DISCOVERED, IS THROUGH  SHAME. SOMETHING CATHOLICS HAVE  KNOWN FOR CENTURIES. THAT'S WHY JESUS KEEPS  GETTING RE-ELECTED. A 2006 STUDY FOUND THAT GET  OUT THE VOTE FLIERS USING  SHAME AND GUILT INCREASED TURNOUT BY AS MUCH AS 8  POINTS. SO THE CAMPAIGNS ARE USING  DATA MINING TO LEARN  EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SHAME  MARCH TO YOU THE POLLS. FOR INSTANCE THEY KNOW  WHETHER VOTERS HAVE VISITED  PORNOGRAPHY WEB SITES, HAVE  HOMES IN FORECLOSURE, ARE MORE PRONE TO DRINK MICHELOB  ULTRA THAN CORE ONO OR HAVE  GAY FRIENDS OR ENJOY  EXPENSIVE VACATIONS. I MEAN THEY COULD SHAME YOU  INTO VOTING BY THREATENING  TO REVEAL THAT YOU AND YOUR GAY FRIENDS WATCH PORN  TOGETHER ON EXPENSIVE  VACATIONS. (LAUGHTER)  OR EVEN WORSE, THAT YOU  DRINK MICHELOB ULTRA. (APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, OF COURSE BARACK  OBAMA IS THE LEADER IN  SHAME-BASED CAMPAIGNING. MITT HAS A HANDICAP BECAUSE  GIVEN HOW MANY TIMES HE'S  FLIPPED POSITIONS, HE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT  OF SHAME. THE POINT IS--   (APPLAUSE)  BOTH CAMPAIGNS WILL-- A HAND  FOR MITT, GIVE IT UP FOR  MITT. POINT IS-- BOTH CAMPAIGNS  MAY KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU THAN  YOU DO. SO PLEASE WELCOME A  JOURNALIST WHO MAY KNOW MORE  ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW THAN  THEY MAY KNOW HE KNOWS. COLUMNIST AND AUTHOR OF THE  BOOK THE VICTORY SLADE SASHA  EISENBERG. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. (APPLAUSE)  NOW SASHA I GOT THE BOOK  HERE. IT IS CALLED THE VICTORY LAB  AND THE SUBTITLE IS THE  SECRET SCIENCE OF WINNING  CAMPAIGNS. WHAT IS THE SECRET SCIENCE  OF WINNING CAMPAIGNS? BECAUSE IN SOME RED STATES  ALL SCIENCE IS SECRET. SO WHAT DOES THIS DO?
WHAT CAMPAIGNS WANT TO DO  IS COLLECT A LOT OF DATA BUT  AND RUN ALGORITHMS AND FIGURE OUT HOW LIKELY ARE  YOU TO VOTE FOR THEIR  CANDIDATE.
Stephen: DO THEY TURN ME  INTO A COMPUTER PROGRAM.
THEY OBAMA HAS  CAME-- CAMPAIGN HAS A IDEA  THEY THINK THERE IS A 09  PERCENT CHANCE WILL YOU SUPPORT OBAMA AS OF TODAY.
Stephen: THEIR MODELS ARE  WAY OFF, WHY, WHY, WHAT IS  IT ABOUT ME, WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT ME.
THEY HAVE A THOUSAND  DIFFERENT DATA POINTS ABOUT  YOU. THEY KNOW FROM YOUR VOTER  REGISTRATION RECORD, WHAT  PARTY, HOW YOUR PRECINCT  VORKTS YOUR SENSE OF TRACK, YOUR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS  THEY THINK OR RACE OR  ETHNICITY AND COLLECT  INFORMATION FROM PRIVATE SECTOR DATA WAREHOUSES THAT  HAS INFORMATION ON THE  THINGS YOU BUY OR  INFORMATION YOU HAVE GIVEN OUT WHEN YOU FILL OUT A  WARRANTY FORM.
Stephen: IF THEY HAVE  INFORMATION WHAT WOULD THEY  GLEAN FROM THIS, I LOVE LEMONADE, I SUBSCRIBE TO  "GOLF" MAGAZINE. I LIKE DEEP PILE SHAG CARPET  AND BELIEVE POOR PEOPLE  SHOULD BE EUTHANIZED. WHAT WOULD YOU GET FROM THAT,  WHERE AM I LEANING THERE.
THE LAST ONE THEY HAVE  PREDICTIVE POWER BUT THE  OTHER ONES ARE THINGS THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE ACCESS TO BUT  DON'T USE TO MAKE A  POLITICAL PREDICTION. THE STUFF THAT HELPS IS  OFTEN THE MOST BORING.
Stephen: WHERE ARE THEY  GETTING THIS INFORMATION  ABOUT ME.
A LOT OF THE COMMERCIAL  INFORMATION IS COMING WHEN  YOU FILL OUT A WARRANTY FORM OR ENTER A SWEEPSTAKE AND  CHECK YOUR HOUSEHOLD INCOME  IS BETWEEN 50 AND $75,000 OR THEY HAVE A COLLEGE  EDUCATION OR THAT YOU TAKE  SIX VACATIONS A YEAR THAT  INFORMATION GETS COLLECTED BY THE PEOPLE THAT DEVELOP  CREDIT RATING SCORES AND  CAMPAIGNS WANT TO DOT SAME  AS CREDIT RATINGS FOR  POLITICS.
Stephen: LIKE A VOTING  RATING SCORE.
THEY WANT TO MAKE A  PREDICTION. HOW LIKELY TO VOTE FOR THEIR  CANDIDATE, TO VOTE AT ALL,  OR TO CHOICE.
Stephen: WITH LEVEL ARE  WE TALKING ABOUT, ARE THEY  MEASURING MY BLOC OR ARE THEY MEASURING ME.
YOU.
Stephen: NO LONGER  STALKER MOM T IS LIKE DEB RA,  AND BRENDA AND DAPHNE.
AND IT IS NOT COUNTIES  AND PRECINCTS EITHER.
Stephen: IT IS  INDIVIDUALS.
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL  PREDICTION FOR ALL 170  MILLION AMERICAN ADULTS WHO  ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE. AND THEY WILL-- .
Stephen: SHOULD I BE AS  TERRIFIED AS I FEEL RIGHT  NOW?
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID THEY  MIGHT KNOW ABOUT YOU. SO-- .
Stephen: THINGS THAT I  WON'T TELL YOU.
THEY COLLECT THIS  INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY  WANT TO CREATE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. THEY WANT TO HAVE AN-- THE  SAME WAY THAT MAYBE YOU PUT  A PROBE INTO A MONKEY'S  BRAIN TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH IT.
RIGHT. SO I THINK THEY ARE COMING  OUT WITH A MORE  PSYCHOLOGICALLY MEANINGFUL  IDEA OF WHAT MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND VOTE.
Stephen: HOW DOES THIS  SHAME WORK. LIKE THEY SAY WE'RE GOING TO  TELL PEOPLE YOU LIKE GOING  TO WEB SITES THAT SHOW  ANIMALS DRESSED UP AS OTHER  ANIMALS.
IN THE 2006 STUDY YOU  MENTIONED WAS IN MICHIGAN. VOTERS WERE RANDOMLY  ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE SEVERAL  DIFFERENT LETTERS ONE SAID  SOMETHING LIKE DEAR STEPH EN, YOUR HISTORY AS A VOTER  IS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE  DOCUMENT WITH THE COUNTY  BOARD OF ELECTION. HERE IS YOUR HISTORY, YOU  VOTED IN THE STATE, IN THE  CITY, HERE IS YOUR  NEIGHBOR'S VOTE HISTORY AND OTHER PEOPLE ON YOUR BLOCK  AND WHETHER THEY VOTED IN  THOSE SAME ELECTIONS AND  THEN THERE WAS A THREAT. THERE IS ANOTHER ELECTION  COMING UP AND WE WILL SEND  EVERYBODY AN UPDATED SET.
Stephen: LITERALLY  THREATENING TO TELL YOUR  NEIGHBOR WLOOS YOU VOTED.
RIGHT. THAT WHERE YOU GET THAT  INCREASE OF 8% THAT PEOPLE  MIGHT HAVE FELT THAT BEING  EXPOSED IN FRONT OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AS A BAD CITIZEN  MATTERS.
Stephen: BUT LISS  FEBRUARY A GUY SENDS ME AN  E-MAIL WITH A THREAT IN IT, WHY WOULDN'T I JUST SAY [BLEEP] YOU I'M VOTING FOR  THE OTHER GUY THAT IS KIND  OF TERRIBLE.
THESE ARE OFTEN  NONPARTISAN  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS GOING TO PEOPLE THEY KNOW WOULD  VOTE FOR THEIR CANDIDATE OR  SIDE AND TRYING TO TURN THEM FROM NONVOTERS INTO  VARIETIES -- NOT ABOUT  CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT  MODIFYING THEIR BEHAVIOR.
Stephen: THESE ARE PEOPLE  YOU KNOW HOW THEY WILL VOTE. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET THEM  OUT OF THE HOUSE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT  SETTING THEIR HOUSE ON FIRE  FOR ELECTION DAY SO THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO.
SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE A  LOT OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES.
Stephen: THAT IS TOO  CUTTING EDGE FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SASHA EISENBERG. THE BOOK IS THE VICTORY LAB,  THE FUTURE, FOLKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
