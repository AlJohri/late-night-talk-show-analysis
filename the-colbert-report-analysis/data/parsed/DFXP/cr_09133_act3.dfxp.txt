EMMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR,  WRITER, DIRECTOR, PLAYED  HALL IN MALCOLM IN THE  MIDDLE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: COMING UP WE'VE  GOT THE SECOND HALF OF THE  FINAL SEASON OF BREAKING BAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: BEFORE WE GET TO  THAT I WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE  SOMETHING. YOU WERE A COME I CON THIS  YEAR BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW.
EVEN WHEN I WAS ON THE  PANEL.
Stephen: TAKE A LOOK, PUT  THIS UP THERE. THIS IS YOU WALKING AROUND  COMIC CON.
YES.
Stephen: WAS THIS SO YOU  COULD ENJOY COMIC CON.
IT WAS-- LANDON MIRE  BUILT THIS. HE IS A BREAKING BAD FAN AND  THAT IS A MASK. IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE I HAVE  ELEPHANTITIS A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YOU LOOK A  LITTLE BIT LIKE JAMES LIPTON  FROM INSIDE THE ACTOR'S  STUDIO.
YES.
AND THEN YOU DID THE  POWER RANGERS.
Stephen: WERE YOU A POWER  RANGER? YOU WERE A POWER RANGER.
I DID A LOT OF THE VOICE  OVERS. I WASN'T A POWER RANGER.
I WAS ONE OF THOSE  MONSTERS WHO WOULD GO YOU  CAN DEFEAT ME. SO NOW KIND OF WE KNOW WHERE  HIGHSENBERG COMES FROM.
THAT WAS THE BIRTH OF  HEISENBERGER.
Stephen: YOU WERE THE  DANGER BACK THEN.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO LET'S TALK  ABOUT THE UPCOMING SECOND  HALF OF THE FINAL SEASON WE HAD 9 CREATOR ON HERE,  AMAZING GUY. HE COLD ME, YOU KNOW WHAT  HAPPENED. AND I WOULD-- SDECHLT AND I  WAS SHOCKED. YOU WERE SHOCKED AND WHAT IS  IT?
SO THEN YOU ALREADY KNOW  THAT-- HAS A SEX CHANGE  OPERATION. ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO WEEDEL  THIS OUT OF YOU RIGHT NOW.
AND I CAN BE BOUGHT OFF,  REALLY, I'M WAITING FOR THE  RIGHT PRICE.
Stephen: IT IS BASIC  CABLE.
AND ARE YOU A CAPITALIST.
Stephen: YES THIS IS THE  THING. THIS IS THE THING. I LOVE WALTER WHITE, OKAY. BECAUSE HE'S KIND OF A HERO  TO ME.
IS HE.
Stephen: YEAH, SMALL  BUSINESSMAN. MADE GOOD.
RIGHT.
HELPS THE LOCAL ECONOMY.
YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY. HE'S A JOB CREATOR. I LIKE THE WAY ARE YOU  THINKING. DOES VERY WELL HOW ARE YOU  GOING TO MAKE THIS A HAPPY  ENDING. NOT GOING TO BE EASY, I'M  SURE.
WELL, THE ENDING IS  ACTUALLY VERY SATISFYING FOR  BREAKING BAD FANS. IT'S UNAPOLOGETIC, VERY  BREAKING BAD. WE HUG, WE KISS, WE FORGIVE  EACH OTHER, WE SING CUM BUY  YA.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO  MISS WALTER WHITE.
DEFINITELY.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO  MISS ALBUQUERQUE.
YES, ABSOLUTELY. EVERY TIME I THINK OF NEW  MEXICO AND ALBUQUERQUE IT  REPRESENTS THAT SHOW. AND IT'S THE GREATEST  PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF  MY LIFE, SO YEAH.
Stephen: SO FAR.
SO FAR. WE DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YOU WERE ALREADY  A BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW FROM  MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. EVERYBODY KNEW WHO YOU WERE. (APPLAUSE)  THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY  SIMILAR.
STILL GETTING APLAUS THE  SECOND TIME YOU MENTIONED IT.
Stephen: THE CHARACTERS  ARE VERY SIMILAR. CAN WE SHOW HOW SIMILAR THE  CHARACTERS ARE FROM MALCOLM  IN THE MIDDLE AND-- THERE YOU GO. THOSE ARE THE TWO.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW WHY-- WHAT  IS IT THAT APPEALS TO YOU  ABOUT BEING IN THE MANTIES.
BASICALLY IT COMES DOWN  TO THIS, AT SOME POINT YOU  JUST HAVE TO GIVE THE PUBLIC WHAT THEY WANT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IS THIS YOUR  IDEA, AS AN ACTOR DOES THIS  DO ANYTHING TO BE --
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING  FOR YOU?
I MEANT AS AN ACTOR, NOT  AN AUDIENCE MEMBER.
IT WAS IN BOTH SCRIPTS. IRONICALLY. THAT HALL WORE TIDY WHITEY  UNDERWEAR AND SO DID WALTER  WHITE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHY UNTIL I  FIGURED OUT HE'S STILL A  BOY. AND HE DOESN'T CARE ANY MORE  SO THAT'S WHY I WENT WITH IT  AND IT'S ALSO SAD WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT UNDERWEAR, IT'S  SAD. AND THEN I GAINED WEIGHT. TO GAIN WEIGHT TO GET THE  LOVE HANDLES AND THE  SOFTNESS, IT'S LIKE YOU FEEL  FOR THAT POOR BASTARD, DON'T  YOU?
Stephen: IT'S LIKE  STAIRING IN A MIRROR. YOU PLAYED THE PART FOR FIVE  SEASONS NOW.
YEAH, FIVE SEASONS.
Stephen: HOW LONG DOES IT  TAKE YOU TO GET INTO PSYCHO  MODE AT THIS POINT OR YOU CAN TURN IT ON AT A MOMENT'S  NOTICE.
YOU KNOW F SOMEONE PUSHES  MY BUTTONS I CAN GET INTO IT  REALLY QUICKLY.
Stephen: I REALLY SHOULD  HAVE AGREED ON A SAFE WORD  BEFORE WE STARTED. BRIAN CRANSTON, THANK YOU  FOR BEING HERE. AUGUST 11th IS WHEN IT  STARTS.
AUGUST 11th.
WE CAN'T LOOK FORWARD TO  IT AND WE-- WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T LOOK FORWARD TO IT  BECAUSE THAT MEANS IT WILL  COME HERE AND THEN IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE OVER.
OH, BUT ALL BAD THINGS  COME TO AN END, DON'T THEY.
Stephen: YES, AND I'M  SURE IT WILL BE IN A GOOD  WAY. BRIAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BRIAN CRANSTON, BREAKING  BAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LAST SEASON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
