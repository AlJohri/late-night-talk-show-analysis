Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT'S SO LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE. FOLKS WE HAVE SO MANY STORIES THAT WE'VE GOT TO COVER TONIGHT, IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS YOU KNOW THERE  IS SO MUCH NEWS BREAKING RIGHT NOW. FOR INSTANCE, U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A, U-S-A! AND IF YOU THOUGHT I WASN'T GOING TO LEAD OFF TONIGHT WITH A PATRIOTIC CHANT AND RESPONSE: YOU WERE WRONG, YOU WERE WRONG, YOU WERE WRONG! THANK YOU. LAST WEEK I MAY HAVE SEEMED EXCITED ABOUT TEAM U.S.A.'S WORLD CUP WIN OVER GHANA, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER AND WE HAD WON THE WORLD CUP. WELL, NEWS FLASH, THERE IS MORE TO THE WORLD THAN US AND GHANA. [LAUGHTER] I HAVE SOME TERRIBLE NEWS, FOLKS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE SAY THIS, BUT I CARE ABOUT SOCCER. [WHISTLES] THAT'S A FOUL ON FOOTBALL FOR USING ITS HANDS TO GRAB MY HEART. I EVEN LEARNED ALL THE WORDS TO THAT OLEÉ SONG. YOU KNOW, OLEÉ, OLEE, OLEÉ, OLEÉ. OLEÉ, SOMETHING, SOMETHING, OLEÉ. IT'S A GOOD SONG. THIS WEEKEND I EVEN WATCHED AN ENTIRE GAME OF SOCCERRING. IT WAS THE U.S. VERSUS OUR ANCIENT RIVAL PORTUGAL, A.K.A. SPEECH IMPEDIMENT SPAIN. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THE PORTUGUESE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YEAH. THE PORTUGUESE STRUCK FIRST WITH A GOAL FIVE MINUTES INTO THE MATCH. BUT IF HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING ABOUT THE PORTUGUESE, FOLKS, IT'S THAT THEY EAT A LOT OF SQUID, AND THEY PEAK EARLY. [LAUGHTER] DON'T WORRY, GUYS, I HEAR THE SPICE TRADE IS GOING TO COME BACK REAL SOON. [LAUGHTER] SO TEAM U.S.A. CAME STORMING BACK, FIRST WITH JERMAINE JONES PULLING TEAM U.S.A. EVEN WITH HIS FOOT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEN TEAM CAPTAIN CLINT DEMPSEY PUT US AHEAD WITH HIS BALLS, I BELIEVE. ALL WE HAD TO DO, ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS HOLD ON TO OUR LEAD, USING ONLY OUR FEET, AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASY BECAUSE PORTUGAL'S BEST PLAYER AND GUY WHO MAKES KEN JEALOUS, CRISTIANO RONALDO, HAD BEEN A SEXY SHADOW OF HIS FORMER SELF.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING FOR HIM AT THAT WORLD CUP. I'M NOT SURE HOW FIT HE REALLY IS.
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE HOW FIT HE REALLY IS EITHER. I BET IF HE TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT, ONLY THE FEMALE FANS WOULD HAVE OVULATED. SORRY, I TAKE THAT BACK, I THINK I JUST DROPPED AN EGG JUST NOW. SO THERE WE WERE, TIME NEARLY EXPIRED, AND THERE WAS OLD MAN RONALDO LUMBERING DOWN THE SIDELINE AND, OH, MY GOSH, NO! NO! [AUDIENCE BOOING] I WAS HOPING IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN THIS TIME. OF COURSE, I WAS NOT ALONE IN MY SPORTS GRIEF. I'M GOING TO ROLL SOME FOOTAGE OF AMERICAN FANS CHANTING "I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN." I WANT YOU TO SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THE MOMENT WHEN PORTUGAL SCORES. CROWD: I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN. I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: IT'S SUBTLE BUT IT'S THERE. BY THE WAY, ANY BOY SCOUT WILL TELL YOU, THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO SLAM THE AMERICAN FLAG TO THE GROUND IN ANGER. TAKE HEART, NATION. TEAM U.S.A.'S WORLD CUP HOPES ARE STILL ALIVE BECAUSE WE PLAY GROUP "G" CO-LEADER GERMANY ON THURSDAY. THESE STANDINGS MAKE ONE THING CLEAR: WE'RE NUMBER ONE, AS LONG AS WE BEAT GERMANY. ALSO WE COULD TIE THEM. WE'D STILL GET THROUGH ON POINTS. AND WE CAN EVEN LOSE, BUT THEN IT COMES DOWN TO MATH. IF PORTUGAL BEATS GHANA BY LESS THAN FIVE GOALS OR GHANA BEATS PORTUGAL BY ONLY ONE GOAL, THEN WE ADVANCE ON GOAL DIFFERENTIAL. THEY CAN EVEN TIE. THAT WOULD STILL WORK. U-S-A? THAT WAS EXHAUSTING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING U-S-A]
Stephen: U-S-A, U-S-A. YOU HEARD THEM, NATION, SO SOCCER GUYS, GO OUT THERE THURSDAY AND DO WHATEVER IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SOCCER WINNING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS... [WHISTLES] FOLKS, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S IRAQ CONTINUES TO DESCEND INTO CHAOS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ELECTED THAT GUY. [LAUGHTER] THE TERRORIST GROUP ISIS IS SPREADING ALL OVER IRAQ LIKE SOME SORT OF FUNDAMENTALIST HUMMUS. [LAUGHTER] AND TRUE DEFENSE HAWKS LIKE ME KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
AIR STRIKES TURN AROUND THE ABILITY FOR AN AL QAEDA ARMY TO MARCH AND GAIN MORE SAFE HAVENS.
WE SHOULD CUT OFF ISIS' ACCESS THAT INVOLVES AIR POWER.
AIR STRIKES COULD BE A BIG, KEY PART.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO MAKE AIR STRIKES.
SEND SOME AIR POWER. SEND SOME AIR POWER WITH TARGETS WE CAN IDENTIFY.
Stephen: YES, WE MUST SEND SOME AIR POWER ON TARGETS WE CAN IDENTIFY. FOR SOME REASON ALL OF IRAQ'S GOOD TARGETS ARE ALREADY RUBBLE. WELL, FOLKS, A CRISIS LIKES THIS DEMANDS ACTION FROM A STRONG, DECISIVE LEADER WITH A CLEAR VISION. BUT I'M BUSY, SO IT WILL HAVE TO BE BARACK OBAMA.
WE'RE PREPARED TO SEND A SMALL NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL  AMERICAN MILITARY ADVISERS, UP TO 300. AMERICAN FORCES WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO COMBAT IN IRAQ.
Stephen: LOUD AND CLEAR, SIR. THESE ARE ADVISERS, NOT COMBAT TROOPS. BIG DIFFERENCE. A COMBAT TROOP SHOOTS A GUY. BUT AN ADVISER SHOOTS A GUY AND THEN SAYS, SEE, THAT'S HOW I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO SHOOT A GUY. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, OUR MILITARY ADVISER PROGRAM IN VIETNAM WAS ONE OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL EVER IN THAT IT WENT ON THE LONGEST. IT STARTED WITH FEWER THAN 1,000 MILITARY ADVISERS SENT BY PRESIDENT EISENHOWER AND GREW TO MORE THAN 500,000 AMERICANS FIGHTING IN VIETNAM BY 1968. THE ADVISER PROGRAM WENT SO WELL THEY EVENTUALLY HAD TO HOLD A VICTORY PARTY ON THE ROOF OF THE U.S. EMBASSY. I GOTTA ASK, THOUGH, IS... YOU WEREN'T INVITED. IS THAT WHY YOU'RE... IT WAS A GOOD IDEA. ALL THOSE ADVISERS WERE A GREAT IDEA IN VIETNAM. I'VE GOT TO ASK, THOUGH, IS 300 ENOUGH?
I AM UNDERWHELMED BY THE 300. IT IS NOT A STRONG SHOWING OF SUPPORT.
THE SOLUTION THAT HE LAID OUT STRUCK ME AS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE.
HOW ON EARTH ARE 300 MILITARY ADVISERS FROM THE U.S. GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
Stephen: YES. AFTER ALL, HOW MUCH CAN 300 SOLDIERS DO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELL, I GOT TO SAY, THAT PART FEELS RIGHT. SINCE IRAQ APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING OF A BOTTOMLESS PIT, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE ADVISERS ARE GOING TO DO. HERE TO TELL ME WHAT THESE ADVISERS ARE GOING TO DO IS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND AUTHOR OF "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE" MARK MAZZETTI. MARK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE BOOK, "THE WAY OF THE KNIFE." GO GET IT. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE'S SENDING IN 300 ADVISERS. WHAT CLASSICALLY IS AN AMERICAN ADVISER?
MOSTLY WHAT THEY DO IS MOSTLY U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS TROOPS. THEY WILL DO TRAINING FOR FOREIGN ARMIES. STEPHEN: DELTA FORCE RANGERS, NAVY SEALS.
ARMY GREEN BERETS. THAT'S THEIR CLASSIC MISSION, DOING THIS KIND OF ADVISING.
Stephen: WHAT KIND OF ADVICE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? ARE WE SAYING, GUYS, I WOULD NOT WEAR THAT SHIRT WITH THOSE PANTS? REALLY, WHAT DOES ADVICE MEAN?
OBAMA SAID THEY'RE NOT GOING BACK INTO COMBAT. WE'LL SEE WHAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENS, BUT FOR NOW THEY WILL BE MORE IN PROTECTED AREAS, MOSTLY LOOKING AT INTELLIGENCE, ANALYZING INTELLIGENCE.
Stephen: IS THAT FOR US OR IS THE INTELLIGENCE THEY'RE GATHERING GOING TO BE GIVEN TO THE IRAQIS?
IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE IRAQIS. IT COULD BE USED FOR AIR STRIKES, DRONE STRIKES, THINGS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ULTIMATELY ORDERS. HE APPARENTLY HASN'T MADE THAT DECISION YET, BUT THAT'S ONE REASON FOR HAVING AMERICAN TROOPS GO IN AND LOOK AT THE INTELLIGENCE AND POSSIBLY PICK OUT TARGETS FOR THE FUTURE. STEPHEN: IF YOU COULD HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S EAR FOR A MOMENT, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HIM TO DO? HOLD ON ONE SECOND. I KNOW HE WATCHES THIS SHOW. MR. PRESIDENT, TAKE ME OFF MUTE FOR A SECOND. OKAY. TAKE ME OFF MUTE. OKAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IS 300 GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB?
WELL, IF THE JOB IS TO STOP A CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ...
Stephen: WHAT OTHER JOB IS THERE HERE? WHAT OTHER JOB IS THERE?
THEY WOULD POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO BLUNT THE ADVANCE OF THIS GROUP ISIS AS IT MOVES TOWARD BAGHDAD. THAT MAY BE THE BEST THEY COULD DO IS STOP THE ADVANCE ON BAGHDAD. MAYBE HIT TROOP POSITIONS OF ISIS. BUT ISIS IS NOW IN THE CITIES. THEY ARE SPREAD OUT AROUND ESPECIALLY THE NORTHERN PART OF IRAQ, SO IT'S NOT AS IF AIR STRIKES ARE THIS PANACEA WHERE YOU CAN SEE MASKED ARMIES. THEY'RE NOW MIXED WITH THE POPULATION. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS SAYING, LET'S HAVE AIR STRIKES.
Stephen: SHOULD OBAMA HAVE SENT ADVISERS EARLIER, SENT MORE OR NOT HAVE SENT THEM AT ALL? AND REMEMBER, WHATEVER YOU THINK THE ANSWER, IS HE'S WRONG.
JUST... ISIS WAS... THE ANSWER IS IT'S NOT EASY TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT. BASICALLY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE IF SENDING ADVISERS MUCH EARLIER WOULD HAVE KEPT ISIS FROM DOING WHAT IT HAS DONE. TAKE MOSUL. TAKE SOME OF THE CITIES IN THE NORTH.
DO YOU THINK THIS IS... OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S EAR. BUT WOULD YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST... WOULD YOU IMAGINE THIS IS THE FIRST 300, YOU KNOW, ADVISERS? COULD WE EVENTUALLY BE ADVISING THEM FROM AIRCRAFT CARRIERS OR ADVISING THEM FROM... YOU KNOW, COULD WE BE CARPET ADVISING THEM OR ADVISING THEM WITH SOME SORT OF MOTORIZED VEHICLE WITH LOTS OF ARMOR AND A BIG GUN ON THE FRONT.
ADVISING CAN MEAN A LOT OF THINGS. EVERY FIBER OF OBAMA'S BODY IS PROBABLY SAYING, I'M NOT GOING TO ESCALATE BACK INTO IRAQ. HIS FOREIGN POLICY LEGACY IS HE ENDED INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ.
Stephen: EVIDENTLY NOT.
EVIDENTLY NOT. SO WE'RE GOING BACK IN, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE SEEING MASSIVE ESCALATION OF THE MILITARY.
Stephen: HOLD ON ONE SECOND. NO, THAT WAS EASY. THANK YOU, MARK. MARK MAZZETTI. "NEW YORK TIMES" NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT MARK MAZZETTI. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
