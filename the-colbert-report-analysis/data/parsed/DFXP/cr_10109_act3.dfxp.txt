WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN THE NEW MOVIE X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, AS PROFESSOR X. I WILL ASK HIM THE QUESTION WHY. PLEASE WELCOME PATRICK STEWART. HEY! PATRICK STEWART, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. NOW PATRICK, OBVIOUSLY AN AWARD WINNING ACTOR OVER THE YEARS. YOU'VE HAD THE HONOR OF PLAYING JEAN LUC PICARD ON STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION.   PROFESSOR XAVIER IN THE X-MEN FILMS YOUR LATEST IS X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, OPENS THIS FRIDAY. THE PLOT OF THE FILM IS YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO YOURSELF BACK IN TIME, CORRECT?
YOU SOUND PUZZLED.
WELL, THAT'S A PUZZLING IDEA IS THAT YOU SEND A MESSAGE TO YOURSELF BACK IN TIME.
YES.
Stephen: IF YOU PATRICK STEWART COULD SEND A MESSAGE BACK TO YOUNGER PATRICK STEWART, WHAT WOULD YOU WARN PATRICK STEWART ABOUT PATRICK STEWART'S FUTURE.
VERY, VERY SIMPLE.
Stephen: WHAT.
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH FUN WHEN I WAS A KID. I WAS ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE. I WAS MADE A PREFECT AT SCHOOL TWO YEARS EARLY.
YOU WERE A PREFECT? DID YOU GO TO HOG WARTS?
NO, NO.
IT IS PAINFUL YOU SHOULD BRING THAT UP, YOU KNOW. BECAUSE I MEAN IAN MCKELLEN AND MYSELF, WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT WE WERE SHOE-INS FOR THE HARRY POTTER MOVIES?
Stephen: WELL, I GOT TO SAY.
NOT ONE PHONE CALL.
Stephen: I GOT TO SAY, I GOT TO SAY, THAT WOULD BE A GREAT THING FOR THE NEXT X-MEN IF YOU GET THE X-MEN TO GO AS HARRY POTTER AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS, THEN YOU CAN REPRESENT EVERY BRITISH ACTOR WHO WORKED FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS. DID IT HURT TO NOT GET A CALL FOR EITHER ONE OF THOSE MOVIES.
IT HURT. IT STILL HURTS.
Stephen: I MEAN WHY HAVE SUCH A DEBILITATING SPEECH IMPEDIMENT LIKE THAT ACCENT OF YOURS AND NOT HAVE IT PAY OFF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THAT HARRY POTTER COIN.
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY I SPEAK?
Stephen: NOT AT ALL.
YOU WERE ASKING A QUESTION.
Stephen: ABOUT TALKING TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF.
YEAH, YEAH. IT WAS-- I WAS TELLING YOU HOW RESPONSIBLE I WAS AS A KID I NEVER HAD CRAZY TEENAGE YEARS. I WOULD GO BACK AND I WOULD SAY PATRICK, CHEER THE [BLEEP] UP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW WE'VE GOT A CLIP FOR THE MOVIE, YEAH, YEAH, WE STOLE ONE.
OH.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. JIM, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
SO I WAKE UP IN MY YOUNGER BODY, GOD KNOWS WHERE, THEN WHAT.
YOU NEED TO GO TO MY HOUSE AND FIND ME. CONVINCE ME OF ALL OF THIS. YOU NEED ME AS WELL.
WHAT?
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE TWO OF US,  SIDE-BY-SIDE AT A TIME WHEN WE COULDN'T BE APART.
YOU'LL HAVE TO BE PATIENT.
PATIENCE ISN'T MY STRONGEST SUIT.
BASICALLY YOUR BODY WILL GO TO SLEEP WHILE YOUR MIND TRAVELS BACK IN TIME. AS LONG AS YOU ARE BACK THERE PAST AND PRESENT WILL CONTINUE TO COEXIST.
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS WILL WORK?
I HAVE FAITH IN HIM.
IT'S NOT HIM I'M WORRIED ABOUT, IT'S US.   WE WERE YOUNG, WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.
WE WILL NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE HAD AN ALTERNATIVE LINE WHEN WE WERE REHEARSING THAT SCENE. AND YOU REMEMBER THAT I SAY I NEED YOU TO GO TO MY HOUSE. AND OUR FAVORITE ONE WAS I'LL NEED YOU TO GO TO MY HOUSE BECAUSE 35 YEARS AGO I THINK I LEFT THE GAS ON. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SPEAKING OF 35 YEARS AGO, IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT YOU, IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU YOURSELF ARE A TIME TRAVELER? BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS A PHOTO OF YOU 24 YEARS AGO. AND THIS IS YOU THIS YEAR. (LAUGHTER) DO YOU BATHE IN THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? (APPLAUSE)
WELL, CLEAN LIVING, CLEAN THINKING. IN EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE. KEEPS MY FLESH, MY SKIN TONED AND CLEAN.
Stephen: WOW. REALLY? HEALTHY MIND, HEALTHY BODY.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THAT'S LOVELY. DOES BEING A SIR COME WITH ANYTHING S THERE A MEMBERSHIP CARD? DO YOU GET 20% OFF OF FIGGIE PUDDING AND STUFF LIKE THAT? ARE YOU ALLOWED TO KILL ONE KNAVE OR CUR WITHOUT ANY REPERCUSSIONS.
YEAH, UPGRADES ON BRITISH AIRWAYS.
Stephen: NO, REALLY? THAT COMES WITH?
WELL, THE LAST TIME I HAD ONE IT CAME THE DAY AFTER MY KNIGHTHOOD WAS ANNOUNCED. AND I IMAGINED A MEMO HAD GONE OUT THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION, YOU KNOW. IF THIS GUY SHOWS UP, YOU KNOW, GET HIM OUT OF COACH AND PUT HIM IN FIRST CLASS.
Stephen: THAT MEANS YOU BOOKED A FLIGHT FOR YOURSELF COACH. I RESPECT THAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE SAID HERE TONIGHT. THAT'S TRUE COURAGE, MY FRIEND.
I LIKE-- AND THIS WILL REPRESENT TO YOU WHERE I STAND POLITICALLY. I LIKE TO BE CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE, TO THE REAL PEOPLE  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T BELIEVE SO YOU WILL ASK ME WHY DID YOU ACCEPT THE KNIGHTHOOD, PATRICK THAT WAS ON YOUR LIPS. I ACCEPTED A KNIGHTHOOD ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT? SAME THING MERE, I GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO DO THE SHOW AND I ACCEPT IT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THANK YOU, PATRICK STEWART.
THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: PATRICK STEWART, X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
