STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. PLEASE, FOLKS, WE'VE GOT TO GO. SIT DOWN. WE'VE GOT TO DO THE SHOW  BECAUSE, FOLKS, TONIGHT -- SIT  DOWN, PLEASE. FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU. TONIGHT, WE HAVE A HUGE STORY  AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU  WHAT THAT IS. I'M BEING TOLD I HAVE TO TELL  YOU WHAT THAT IS. EVIDENTLY THAT IS MY ONLY JOB. OKAY. FORMER N.S.A. ANALYST AND  CURRENT DRONE BAIT EDWARD  SNOWDEN HAS GONE MISSING, FOLKS. THAT'S RIGHT. THIS COMPUTER WHIZ HAS HIT  ESCAPE, CONTROL-ALT-DELETED  HIMSELF AND HAS AVOIDED BEING CAPS-LOCKED UP, F7. JIM?
MAN ON THE RUN. WHERE IS N.S.A. LEAKER EDWARD  SNOWDEN HEADED NEXT.
THE HIGH-STAKES GAME OF CAT  APPED MOUSE REACHES A FEVER  PITCH AS SPY WHISTLE-BLOWER EDWARD SNOWDEN REMAINS ON THE  RUN.
EDWARD SNOWDEN SAYS CATCH ME  IF YOU CAN. A GLOBAL GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK
Stephen: YES, A GLOBAL GAME  OF HIDE AND SEEK. WHY DID WE AGREE TO COUNT ALL  THE WAY TO 100? AND HAS ANYONE CHECKED BEHIND  CURTAINS IN THE LIVING ROOM? NOW, FOLKS, NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY  WHERE SNOWDEN MIGHT BE. SO FAR THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOT  OF IRRESPONSIBLE SPECULATION AND  I WANT IN ON IT WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NOW RUNNING SEGMENT  ♪ WHERE IN THE WORLD IS EDWARD  SNOW-DIEGO?  ♪♪ [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: IF I GET IT RIGHT, I  COULD WIN A TRIP TO ANYWHERE IN  THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES. OH, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO  QUEENS. BETTER GET MY SHOTS. NOW, FOR WEEKS NOW, FOLKS, IT'S  BEEN BELIEVED THAT SNOWDEN HAS  BEEN HOLED UP IN HONG KONG. LET ME SHOW YOU. OKAY. FOR WEEKS IT'S BEEN THOUGHT THAT  HE'S HOLED UP IN HONG KONG BUT  YESTERDAY HE BOARDED A FLIGHT TO  MOSCOW. JIMMY? JIMMY, IS THIS GOOD?
IT'S AN OCEAN, STEPHEN  Stephen: OKAY. IS THAT WARMER?
YOU'RE BACK IN HONG KONG. Stephen: ANYWAY, IT DOESN'T  MATTER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE MOSCOW  IS BECAUSE SNOWDEN MAY NOT EVEN  BE THERE. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON A  FLIGHT THIS MORNING FROM MOSCOW  TO HAVANA, CUBA, BUT A REPORTER ON THE FLIGHT TWEETED THIS PHOTO  OF SNOWDEN'S EMPTY SEAT. MEANING EITHER HE DIDN'T SHOW OR  HE WAS IN THE BATHROOM. AFTER ALL, HE IS A KNOWN LEAKER. THE TRUTH IS, SNOWDEN COULD BE  ANYWHERE, FOLKS, EVEN RIGHT HERE  IN HAD THIS STUDIO. HOLD ON, WAIT A SECOND. JAY, ARE YOU EDWARD SNOWDEN?
NO, I'M JAY. Stephen: ARE YOU SURE? YOU'RE WHITE AND YOU HAVE  GLASSES.
SO ARE YOU. tephen: OH, MY GOD! I MIGHT BE EDWARD SNOWDEN. TALK! AM ME: EDWARD SNOWDEN? SPEAK UP, GOD DAMN IT. [BLEEP]. NO! OKAY. STORY CHECKS OUT. FOLKS, MY JOB IS NOT EASY, AS  YOU CAN SEE. BUT LATELY MY JOB HAS BEEN KIND  OF FUN. YOU SEE, BARACK OBAMA IS  ENGULFED IN SO MANY SCANDALS,  YOU ALMOST FORGET HE'S BLACK. FOR MY MONEY, HIS MOST SERIOUS  SCANDAL IS THE I.R.S.'S  TARGETING OF THE TEA PARTY. WELL, LAST WEEK THOSE TEA PARTY  PATRIOTS ROARED BACK.
TEA PARTY PROTESTERS STORMING  CAPITOL HILL. RAILING AGAINST THE I.R.S. AND  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS  GATHERED OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL TO  STAND UP AGAINST TARGETING FROM THE I.R.S. AND TO PUSH BACK  AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT.
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE  POLITICIANS TO LISTEN TO ALL OF  YOU. YOU'RE HERE. AND YOU'RE CLEAR. WITH YOUR MESSAGE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE CLEAR. AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE QUEER,  HIGH MUSS BAND RUNS A CAMP THAT  CAN CURE YOU WITH JESUS. LUCKILY, FOLKS, ONE MAN IS  GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS  SCANDAL: CALIFORNIA  REPRESENTATIVE AND MAFIA TRIBUTE FACE DARRELL ISSA WHO  INTERROGATED TOP OFFICIALS FROM  THE I.R.S.'S CINCINATTI OFFICE IN CLOSED-DOOR HEARINGS AS HE  EXPLAINED ON CNN'S STATE OF THE  CROWLEY.
WHAT WE HAVE ARE PEOPLE WHO  COME IN TO TRANSCRIBE INTERVIEWS  AND THEY'RE SAYING UNDER PENALTY OF CRIMES THAT CERTAIN THINGS  ARE TRUE
Stephen: DID YOU HEAR THAT? CERTAIN THINGS ARE TRUE. REMEMBER, THAT'S UNDER PENALTY  OF CRIMES WHICH MEANS I BELIEVE  IF THEY'RE LYING THEY HAVE TO COME COMMIT A CRIME. AND THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW. AND ISSA PRESENTED THE HARD  EVIDENCE OF WHAT HE FOUND.
THE ADMINISTRATION IS STILL  TRYING TO SAY THERE WAS A FEW  ROGUE AGENTS IN CINCINATTI WHEN IN FACT THE INDICATION IS THEY  DIRECTLY BEING ORDERED FROM  WASHINGTON. MY GUT TELLS ME THAT TOO MANY  PEOPLE KNEW THAT THIS WRONGDOING  WAS GOING ON.
Stephen: YEAH, MY GUT TELLS  ME THE SAME THING. I MEAN THIS CAN'T JUST BE  CINCINATTI. REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING: WHAT  HAPPENS IN CINCINATTI, NOTHING  HAPPENS IN CINCINATTI. AND THAT'S WHAT ISSA SAID. BUT HE REFUSED TO RELEASE THE  FULL TRANSCRIPTS FOR A VERY GOOD  REASON WHICH HE ALSO REFUSED TO  RELEASE. BUT ON ON TUESDAY, CONGRESSMAN  ELIJAH CUMMINGS RELEASED THE  FULL TRANSCRIPT TO THE PRESS. AND IT PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT  ISSA WAS RIGHT. TO NOT WANT THE TRANSCRIPT  RELEASED. JIM?
A CINCINATTI-BASED I.R.S. MANAGER WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS  A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN TOLD  CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE  WHITE HOUSE WAS INVOLVED IN  TARGETING CONSERVATIVE GROUPS.
Stephen: GOD DAMN IT. SO THIS SCANDAL IS NOT CONNECTED  TO OBAMA. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. I WANT TO HEAR TONIGHT'S WORD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TRUTHINEWS. NATION, LISTEN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I DO  NOT WATCH THE NEWS TO SEE WHAT I  DON'T WANT TO HEAR. AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. THESE DAYS THERE'S A NEWS  CHANNEL FOR EVERYONE:  CONSERVATIVES HAVE FOX. LIBERALS HAVE MSNBC, AND THE  ELDERLY WHO LOST THE REMOTE IN  1988 HAVE HEADLINE NEWS. NOW, CABLE NETWORKS HAVE ONE  CARDINAL RULE. THAT RULE IS TO TELL THEIR  VIEWERS WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. SPEAKING OF WHICH, TUNE IN  TOMORROW FOR MY SPECIAL REPORT  "HAVE YOU LOST WEIGHT?" AND, FOLKS, TELEVISION NEWS  ISN'T ONLY SAYING WHAT YOU WANT  TO HEAR. THEY'RE LETTING YOU HEAR YOU SAY  IT.
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. 'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU  VIA TWITTER.
WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU  THINK.
DON'T FOR GFER GET TO VOTE. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO HELP US  CREATE A FOOD LOVERS MAP OF THE  WORLD.
WE DID A BILL O'REILLY  DOT-COM POLL BUT IT DOES  INDICATE WHAT MY VIEWERS  BELIEVE. 75% OF THEM SAID FACTOR WAS FAIR  IN ITS COVERAGE.
TWITTER ONLINE AND THEN WE'LL  FIGURE IT OUT TOMORROW
Stephen: JUST LIKE ANCHORMAN  WALTER CRONKITE USED TO SAY: AND  THAT'S THE WAY I THINK IT WAS. I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT TOMORROW. THE POINT IS CABLE NEWS IS  INCREASINGLY PUTTING THE "ME" IN  MEDIA. ESPECIALLY THE GOOD FOLKS OVER  AT CNN. ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE FULL  I.R.S. DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPT  CLEARING OBAMA WAS RELEASED, CNN'S HEADLINE READ "SHIFTING  I.R.S. POLLS CONTRADICT KEY  DEPOSITION."  TAKE THAT. KEY DEPOSITION. CNN HAS THE POLL. A POLL THAT SAYS HALF OF  AMERICANS THINK OBAMA DID IT  ANYWAY. NOW, FOLKS, YEARS AGO I GAVE YOU  SOMETHING CALLED TRUTHINESS,  IGNORING WHAT THE FACTS SAY AND INSTEAD GOING WITH WHAT FEELS  RIGHT IN YOUR GUT. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN YOU PUT A BUNCH OF THOSE  GUTS TOGETHER? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU TURN  TRUTHINESS INTO TRUTHINEWS. WITH TRUTHINEWS, CABLE NEWS  NETWORKS HAVE ONLY ONE  OBLIGATION. THEIR OBLIGATION IS TO REPORT  WHATEVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  ALREADY THINK. IF ONLY TRUTHINEWS WERE AROUND  IN THE LAST CENTURY WE COULD  HAVE SEEN GREAT HEADLINES LIKE DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN? YOU TELL US. AND 63% BELIEVE TITANIC IS STILL  UNSINKABLE. LUCKILY, NOW TRUTHINEWS IS HERE  TO USHER IN A NEW STANDARD OF  BROADCASTING. FIRST, WE ASK YOU WHAT YOU THINK  THE NEWS IS. THEN REPORT THAT NEWS YOU TOLD  US BACK TO YOU. THEN TAKE AN INSTANT TWITTER  POLL TO SEE IF YOU FEEL INFORMED  BY YOURSELF WHICH WE WILL READ ON THE AIR UNTIL WE REACH THAT  GOLDEN DAY WHEN WE ARE SO  RESPONSIVE TO OUR VIEWERS THAT CABLE NEWS IS NOTHING BUT A  MIRROR, A LOGO AND A NEWS CRAWL. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
