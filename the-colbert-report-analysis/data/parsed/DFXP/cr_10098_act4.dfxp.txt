Stephen: AND NOW ONE OF THE STARS OF HOLLER IF YA HEAR ME, HERE TO PERFORM A POEM FROM THE DEAD EMCEE SCROLLS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SAUL WILLIAMS. (APPLAUSE)
I STAND ON THE CORNER OF THE BLOCK SLINGING AMETHYST ROCKS, DRINKING 40s MOTHER EARTH'S PRIVATE NECTAR STOCK, DODGING COPS CUZ FIVE-OH BE THE 666, AND I NEED A FIX OF THAT PURPLE RAIN: TYPE OF [BLEEP]  THAT DRIVES MEMBRANES INSANE.  OH YEAH I'M IN THE FAST LANE, SNORTING CANDY YAMS THAT FREE MY BODY AND SOUL AND SEND ME LIKE SHAZAAM, NEVER QUESTION WHO I AM. GOD KNOWS AND I KNOW GOD PERSONALLY. IN FACT HE LETS ME CALL HIM "ME." I BE ONE WITH RAIN  AND STARS AND THINGS WITH DANCING FEET AND WATERMELON RINGS I BRING THE SUNSHINE AND THE MOON AND THE WIND BLOWS MY TUNE. MEANWHILE I SPOON POWDERED DRUMBEATS INTO PLASTIC BAGS SELLING KILOS OF KINTAE STAG, TAKING DRAGS OFF OF COLLARDS AND CORNBREAD FREEBASING THROUGH SAXOPHONES AND FRUITS LIKE MAD, THE HIGH NOTES MAKE ME SPACE-FLOAT, I BE EXHALING RINGS    THAT CIRCLE SATURN, LEAVING IN MY VEINS IN ASTROLOGICAL   PATTERNS. YEAH I'M SERIOUS B, DOGGONE [BLEEP] PLOTTED [SHIT]  LOVELY, BUT THE FEDS IS ALSO PLOTTING ME, THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPRISON MY ASTROLOGY, PUT MY STARS BEHIND BARS MY STARS AND STRIPES, USING BLOOD-SPATTERED BANNERS AS NATIONALIST KITES, BUT I CONTROL THE WIND, THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT THE HAWK. I AM HORUS, SON OF ISIS, SON OF OSIRUS,  WORSHIPPED AS JESUS, RESURRECTED LIKE LAZARUS, BUT YOU CAN CALL  ME LAZZY, LAZY, YEAH I'M LAZY BECAUSE I'D RATHER SIT AND BUILD THAN WORK AND PLOW A FIELD AND WORSHIP THE DAILY YIELD OF CASH GREEN CROPS, YOUR EVOLUTION STOPPED THE EVOLUTION OF YOUR TECHNOLOGY: A SOCIETY OF AUTOMATIC TELLERS AND MONEY MACHINES, BUT WHAT,  MY CULTURE IS LIMA BEANS AND TAMBOURINES, DREAMS MANIFEST DREAMS REAL, NOT CONSISTENT WITH RATIONALE. I DANCE FOR NO REASON, FOR REASON YOU CAN'T DANCE. CALL ME AN ACTIVIST OF INTELLECTUALIZED CIRCUMSTANCE YOU CAN'T LEARN MY STEPS UNTIL YOU UNLEARN YOUR THOUGHTS. SPIRIT, SOUL CAN BE STORE-BOUGHT, [BLEEP] THOUGHT LEADS TO NAUGHT, SIMPLY LEADS TO YOU TRYING TO FIGURE ME OUT YOUR INTELLECT'S DISFIGURING YOUR SOUL, YOUR BEING'S NOT WHOLE CHECK YOUR FLAGPOLE, STARS AND STRIPES, YOUR ASTROLOGY'S IMPRISONED BY YOUR CONCEPT OF WHITE, OF SELF WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR SPIRITUAL HEALTH? CALLING REALITY UNREAL YOUR LINE OF THOUGHT IS TANGLED, THE STAR SPANGLED GOT YOUR SOUL MANGLED YOUR BEING'S ANGLED, FORBIDDING YOU TO BE REAL AND FEEL YOU CAN'T FIND TRUTH WITH AN AXE OR A DRILL IN A WHITE HOUSE ON A HILL OR IN FACTORIES OR PLANTS MADE OF STEEL. STEALING US WAS SMARTEST THING YOU EVER DID, TOO BAD YOU DON'T TEACH TRUTH TO YOUR KIDS. MY INFLUENCE ON USER REFLECTION YOU SEE WHEN YOU LOOK IN YOUR MINSTREL MIRROR AND TALK ABOUT YOUR CULTURE, YOUR  EXISTENCE IS THAT OF A SCHIZOPHRENIC VULTURE WHO THINKS HE HAS ENOUGH LIFE IN HIM TO PREY ON THE DEAD, NOT KNOWING THAT THE DEAD AIN'T DEAD, THAT HE AIN'T GOT ENOUGH SPIRITUALITY TO KNOW HOW TO PRAY. YEAH, THERE'S NO REPENTANCE, YOU'RE BOUND TO LIVE IN INFINITE CONSECUTIVE EXECUTIVE LIFE SENTENCE. SO WHILE YOU'RE BUSY SERVING TIME I'LL BE IN SYNC WITH THE MOON WHILE YOU RUN FROM THE SUN. LIFE OF THE WOMB,  REFLECTED BY GUNS, WORSHIP OF MOONS, I AM THE SUN, AND I AM PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE, ONE ONE ONE, ONE ONE ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Stephen: SAUL WILLIAMS. HOLLER IF YOU HEAR ME ON BROADWAY. GOODNIGHT!
