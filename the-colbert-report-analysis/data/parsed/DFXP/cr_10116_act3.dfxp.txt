Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A RENOWNED DIRECTOR WHO HITCHHIKED ACROSS AMERICA FOR HIS NEW MEMOIR. IT'S A GOOD THING. IF HE HAD FLOWN IT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY SHORT BOOK. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN WATERS. [APPLAUSE] HEY, JOHN. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN OTHER THAN STRANGE?
WELL, THAT'S HOW I MAKE MY LIVING. EVERY MORNING I GO TO WORK AND I HAVE TO THINK UP SOMETHING WEIRD AND I SELL IT IN THE AFTERNOON. THAT'S MY JOB.
Stephen: HERE'S MY PROBLEM WITH YOU. YOU KNOW I GOT A COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH YOU. MY NUMBER-ONE PROBLEM WITH YOU IS YOU ARE THE ODDEST FIGURE IN AMERICAN CULTURE THAT WE ALSO LOVE AT THE SAME TIME. WE LOVE YOU FOR YOUR ODDNESS.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: BUT I'M A TRADITIONAL AMERICAN MAN. I'M THREATENED BY THE FACT THAT I STILL LIKE YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO OUR CULTURE? DO YOU THINK RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEGRADATION OF OUR MORALS?
YES. I'M PROUD THAT I'VE INVITED YOU INTO A WORLD WHERE YOU'D BE UPTIGHT AND I MAKE YOU FEEL SAFE AND I'M YOUR GUIDE AND YOU CAN LAUGH. YES, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. THEN PEOPLE DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: JOHN, IF PEOPLE DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE, I'M OUT OF A JOB.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
Stephen: EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM YOUR ICONIC MOVIES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR NEW BOOK, "CARSICK: JOHN WATERS HITCHHIKES ACROSS AMERICA." YOU ACTUALLY HITCHHIKED.
FROM BALTIMORE TO SAN FRANCISCO.
Stephen: WHAT ON EARTH? WHEN I WAS... IN THE 1970s, I GREW UP IN THE '70s, THAT WAS BIG HITCHHIKING TIME. ♪ LIKE A VISION SHE WAS LAYING THERE ♪♪ CHEVY VAN. PICK UP A GIRL, HAVE SEX WITH HER, DROP HER OFF AT THE NEXT TOWN. I WAS TAUGHT NOT TO HITCHHIKE BY MY FOLKS BECAUSE THE MANSON FAMILY WOULD GRAB YOU. WEREN'T YOU SCARED?
I WAS SCARED THAT NOBODY WOULD PICK ME UP. BUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK, I IMAGINED ALL THE THINGS I WOULD BE SCARED OF. I WROTE 15 RIDES, THE BEST I COULD IMAGINE, AND THE BEST FOR ME WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE THE BEST FOR YOU.
Stephen: YOU HAVE BEST-CASE AND WORST-CASE SCENARIOS. WHAT'S THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED?
WELL I HAD SEX IN A DEMOLITION DERBY IN THE CAR  IN THE RACE. THAT WAS FUN.
Stephen: JOHN, THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF UNSAFE SEX.
WELL, IT WAS SAFE.
Stephen: WHO WERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DID PICK YOU UP?
A MINISTER'S WIFE. A COP. A TRUCKER. A COAL MINER. A ROCK BAND CALLED "HERE WE GO MAGIC"
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THEY PULLED THEIR CAR OVER FOR YOU? IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE A VALET?
NO, I THINK I'M THE BELLBOY AT HOWARD JOHNSON'S. THAT'S WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE.
Stephen: WERE YOU EVER SCARED?
I WAS NOT SCARED OF THE PEOPLE.
Stephen: WERE THEY SCARED OF YOU?
NO, THEY THOUGHT I WAS A HOMELESS MAN. THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME. THEY THOUGHT I WAS A BEGGAR WHO WAS TOO STUPID TO HOLD THE SIGN AT A RED LIGHT INSTEAD OF AT AN ENTRANCE RAMP WHERE I WAS
Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER ABOUT AMERICA? HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU?
IT TOOK NINE DAYS, 21 RIDES.
WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER IN YOUR 21 RIDES? IS THERE ANY COMMON THEME BETWEEN ALL THESE PEOPLE?
HOW INCREDIBLY OPEN MINDED THEY WERE ABOUT PEOPLE. HOW PEOPLE THAT PICK UP HITCHHIKERS, ONCE THEY STOP, IT MAKES THEM A LITTLE BETTER OF A PERSON. I THINK THE PEOPLE WERE GREAT. THEY WERE SO OPEN MINDED, MORE OPEN MINDED THAN INTELLECTUALS I KNOW IN L.A. AND NEW YORK. THESE PEOPLE DEFIED WHAT YOU'D THINK ABOUT A COAL MINER. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF THEY WERE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT EITHER. THEY WERE COMPLETELY OPEN TO HELPING PEOPLE.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE A FAVE?
MY FAVE, WELL, I HAD A REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIAL, THE YOUNGEST ONE IN MARYLAND, WHO PICKED ME UP AND DROVE ME TO OHIO. HIS PARENTS THOUGHT I KIDNAPPED HIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD TO GOOGLE ME IF YOU'RE A PARENT. THEN HE DROVE 48 HOURS AT 80mph AND CAUGHT UP WITH ME IN DENVER AND GAVE ME MORE RIDES. HE WAS THE BEST RIDE I HAD, DEFINITELY.
Stephen: WOW. WOW.
HE WAS GREAT.
Stephen: WAS THERE... WAS THERE ANY CHANCE HE TOOK YOU TO A DEMOLITION DERBY?
NO. HE DIDN'T. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT. IT WAS A BROMANCE.
Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU MOST AFRAID OF. WE'VE HEARD YOUR BEST-CASE SCENARIOS. WHAT WERE YOUR WORSE CASE SCENARIOS? WHAT WERE YOU AFRAID MIGHT HAPPEN?
I WAS AFRAID... I GOT PICKED UP BY A WOMAN. I GET IN THE CAR, AND SHE SAID, HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH A JUNKY. AND I SAID, WELL, NOT KNOWINGLY. AND SHE SAID, BECAUSE YOU CAN JUDGE. YOU CAN COME OUT AND I CAN'T BE STRUNG OUT? SHE WAS ONLY SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO JUNKIES, WHICH IS CALLED A SCAG HAG. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS.
IT'S FICTION.
Stephen: YOU CAN GO INTO YOUR OWN MIND AND SURPRISE YOURSELF.
THAT'S WHAT I HOPED TO DO.
Stephen: THIS BEING AMERICA, WERE YOU PACKING HEAT?
NO. BUT ALL MY CRIMINAL FRIENDS TOLD ME TO. ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW IN JAIL SAID, TAKE A GUN. TAKE MACE. THEY WERE MORE UPTIGHT ABOUT IT THAN MY FAMILY.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN JAIL. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: WHAT'S THE LESSON YOU WANT TO TEACH ALL OF US?
THAT THIS SUMMER EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE A HITCHHIKING TRIP, EVEN IF IT'S FOR TWO MILES. IT'S AN ADVENTURE, A SOAP OPERA, A REALITY SHOW. YOU'LL MEET NEW PEOPLE. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO ON DATING SITES. JUST GO HITCHHIKING.
Stephen: THAT IS WONDERFUL ADVICE THAT FOR LEGAL REASONS I WILL NOT ENDORSE. JOHN WATERS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BOOK IS "CARSICK." JOHN WATERS, THE GREAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
