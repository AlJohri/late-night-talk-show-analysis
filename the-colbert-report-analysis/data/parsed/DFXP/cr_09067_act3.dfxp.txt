Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  THEORETICAL PHYSICIST WHO'S  WRITTEN A NEWSWEEK  ARTICLE ENTITLED "ASTEROID APOCOLYPSE."  SHOCKING STUFF-- THERE'S STILL A  "NEWSWEEK"! PLEASE WELCOME MICHIO KAKU! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GLAD TO BE ON IT.
Stephen: EVERYBODY KNOWS  YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF THE  NATIONAL BEST SELLER THE PHYSICS OF FUTURE. YOU ARE THE PROFESSOR OF  THEORETICAL FIZZISTS IN NEW  YORK. YOU AWJERRED THE COVER STORY ON  "THE NEWSWEEK" LET'S CALL IT  MAGAZINE, WILL AFTER THE ROVES DESTROY THE EARTH. OKAY. WHAT ARE THE THEORETICAL  PHYSICISTS KNOW ABOUT ACTUAL  ASTEROIDS?
WELL, WE LOOK AT THE  EVIDENCE. IN 1908 WE HAD A CITY THAT FELL  ON SIGH BEERA, WIPED OUT 830  SQUARE MILES OF SIBERIAN REAL  ESTATE.
Stephen: THE TUNGASTA  EVENT.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LAST  WEEK. IT SCIMED THE EARTH. WE DODGED A BULLET AND THEN  ANOTHER ASTEROID HIT RUSSIA. AND IF THAT METEOR WAS DELAYED  BY TWO OR THREE SECONDS, IT  WOULD HAVE BEEN A GROUND BURST RATHER THAN AN AIR BURST AND AT  40,000 MILES PER HOUR DO THE  MATH IT'S 20 HERO SHEEMA BOMBS. -- HER -- HIROSHIMA BOMBS.
Stephen: I'M HAPPY DO YOU  THE MATH. HOW OFTEN IS THIS HAPPEN  SOMETHING IN.
WE DIDN'T HAVE LARGE  METROPOLISES HUNDREDS OF YEARS  AGO, WE HAD FISHING VIL YANLZ THEY HIT THE EARTH BEFORE. WE WERE OBLIVIOUS, BLISSFULLY  UNAWARE THAT WE HAD NEAR MISSES  AND ACTUAL COLLISIONS WITH OBJECTS ABOUT THE SIZE OF AN  APARTMENT BUILDING. THESE ARE CITY BUSES. AND THEN WE HAVE A NATION BUSTER  WHICH IS GOING TO COME GRAZING  PAST THE EARTH AND MAY EVEN HIT THE EARTH. THAT'S CALLED THE ASTEROID  APOFET. IT'S TEN TIMES BIGGER THAN THE  ASTEROID THAT SCIMED THE EARTH  LAST WEEK.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  MAY HIT? WHAT IS THE -- DO THE MATH. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS THE MATH ON THAT ONE?
WELL, FIRST IT'S GOING TO  SKIM BY THE EARTH IN 2029 AND  IT'S GOING TO GRAZE THE  ATMOSPHERE. THAT'S THE QUESTION MARK. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FRICTION  IT'S GOING TO ENCOUNTER. THAT CANNOT BE FACTORED  RELYIBLY. WHEN IT GRAZES THE ATMOSPHERE ON  THE SECOND PASS IN 2036 THERE'S  A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE THING COULD ACTUALLY HIT THE  EARTH EVEN THOUGH IT'S STILL  VERY SMALL.
Stephen: BECAUSE OF THE  FRICTION IT ENCOUNTERS ON 2029.
THAT'S RIGHT IN THE SECOND  PASS.
Stephen: CAN WE LUBRICATE  THE EARTH IN SOME WAY SO THERE'S  NOT SO MUCH FRICTION? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND JUST DUZ -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THE RUSSIANS HAVE TAKEN THIS  SERIOUSLY.
Stephen: OF COURSE, THEY  WOULD. THEY ALMOST GOT TAGGED.
THEY SAID WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN  SERIOUS PROPALS. MAYBE IN 2029 --
Steve: WHERE DO YOU STAND  IN SPACE TO DO THE NUDGING?
FIRST YOU HAVE TO LAND ON IT,  PUT A ROCKET ON IT AND THE  ROCKET WILL PUSH IT SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE WAY SO IN THE SECOND PASS  IT WILL MISS THE EARTH.
Stephen: I ASSUME THIS IS  LIKE BRUCE WILLIS AND A TEAM OF  MINERS WHO GET TRAINED TO BE ASTRONAUTS FOR SOME REASON.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS STATED  THAT THE NEXT GOAL NOW THAT HE  CANCELED THE MOON AND MARS MISSION IS TO LAND ON AN  ASTEROID, IN WHICH CASE IF WE  LAND ON ONE, IT WILL BE A DRESS  REHEARSAL. BLOWING IT UP ALA BRUCE WILLIS  THERE'S BABY ASTEROIDS COMING AT  YOU.
Stephen: IT TURNS A BULLET  SHOTGUN PELLETS.
YES, UP WANT TO KEEP IT IN  TAFNLGT WE'RE GOING TO BE  LOOKING AT IT VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY F. IT'S HELD TOGETHER BY GRAVEITY  OR A SOLID PIECE OF ROCK THAT WE  COULD PUSH WITH A HYDRO AGAIN BOMB OR A ROCKET.
Stephen: THE COMET IS  COMING BY?
PERHAPS THE END OF THIS YEAR  THE COMET OF THE CENTURY WILL  COME BY. THEY ARE RARER THAN METEORS. SHOOTING STARS --
Stephen: THOSE ARE METEORS.
HOWEVER ATOMIC CAN LINGER IN  THE NIGHT SKY FOR WEEKS AT A  TIME SCARING THE PANLTS OFF EVERYONE AND THAT'S WHY EVERYONE  THINKS THE KINGS IS FORETOLD BY  THE COMING OF COMET AND THE COMET OF CENTURY IS. COG LATER THIS YEAR IN NOVEMBER.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHAT  IT'S CALLED?
NO, I HAVE TO LOOK IT UP ON  THE INTERNET.
Stephen: WE CAN LOOK IT UP  RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. DR. MICHIO KAKU, "PHYSICS OF THE
