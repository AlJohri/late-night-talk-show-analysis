STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, THERE IS NO SECRET. PLEASE, FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL  YOU... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE, PLEASE. SIT DOWN. FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU  THERE IS NO SECRET WHY THESE  PEOPLE ARE HAPPY. THERE IS A ROYAL BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THE WORLD IS IN THE GRIPS OF  POST-PARTUM JUBILATION. FOLKS, WITH ALL THE DEPRESSING  STORIES OUT THERE THAT I HAVE TO  REPORT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, IT IS REFRESHING ONCE IN A WHILE TO BE  ABLE TO TELL YOU THE UPLIFTING  STORY THAT THE IDLE RICH CAN PRO-CREATE.��|  THEY DO IT. STILL, NO WORD ON A NAME NAME  FOR THE BABY. I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE SOME SORT  OF WEB CONTEST TO NAME THE BABY. I WANT STEPHEN COLB-INCE THE  PRINCE. GET READY, NATION. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS  THE FONTANEL FIRMS UP. TOMORROW WE'LL HAVE FULL TEAM  COVERAGE AND... HOLD ON ONE  SECOND. GET A TEAM. BUT FIRST, FOLKS, SAD NEWS. THIS WEEKEND WE LOST A TRUE  LEGEND OF JOURNALISM WITH THE  PASSING OF WHITE HOUSE REPORTER AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW HELEN  THOMAS. HELEN COVERED TEN PRESIDENTS  OVER HER 60-YEAR CAREER, AND HER  FELLOW JOURNALISTS ARE REMEMBERING HER WITH TRIBUTES,  ANECDOTES, AND IN THE CASE OF  GERALDO RIVERA, BY POSTING A NAKED SELFIE ON TWITTER. THOUGH COME TO THINK OF IT, THAT  MIGHT NOT HAVE A TRIBUTE TO  HELEN. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT KILLED  HER. MAN, HE LOOKS GOOD. HE LOOKS REALLY GOOD. LOOK HOW WELL DEFINED DOWN HERE  THESE... I'M NOT SURE. MY PEOPLE HAVE NO WORD FOR THAT  MUSCLE.o�]?�  SAME WAY TO HEREBYIANS HAVE NO  WORD FOR SNOW. THE FLYING BUTTRESSES, I  SUPPOSE. NO SURPRISE THAT GERALDO IS ONCE  AGAIN BLAZING TRAILS HERE OR, IN  THE CASE OF HIS HAPPY TRAIL, WAXING IT. AND THE TRAIL HE'S BLAZING,  FOLKS, IS FOR THE SEXY SENIORS  OUT THERE. AS GERALDO WROTE IN HIS TWEET,  "70 IS THE NEW 50."  EXACTLY. AND IF THERE'S ONE THING PEOPLE  WANT TO SEE ON THEIR TWITTER  FEEDS, IT'S NAKED 50-YEAR-OLD  MEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'VE GOT ONE YEAR TO GET MY [BLEEP] TOGETHER. AND AS GERALDO SAID IN HIS  TWEET, "ERICA AND FAMILY ARE  GOING TO BE SO PISSED... BUT AT MY AGE..." YES, AT HIS AGE, HE  HAS CLEARLY LOST ALL JUDGMENT. AND ALSO HAS FEWER YEARS TO HAVE  TO LIVE THIS DOWN. AND IT IS GREAT TO SEE GERALDO  JOIN THE LONG TRADITION OF  JOURNALISTIC BEEFCAKE. I MEAN, WHO COULD FORGET WALTER  CRONKITE'S FAMOUS SIGN-OFF, "AND  THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. NOW WATCH MY PECS DANCE."  NATION, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN  SUSPICIOUS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE. MINIMUM IS A MISNOMER. $7.25? I CAN THINK OF WAGES A LOT  LOWER. $3.28. $1.19. A PAT ON THE BACK AND A HANDFUL  OF MINTS. THERE ARE LITERALLY DOZENS OF  OTHER THINGS YOU COULD GIVE  THEM. A BARN OWL. AND WHEN IT COMES TO OPPOSING  THE MINIMUM WAGE, I'M IN GOOD  COMPANY WITH GUYS WHO OWN  COMPANIES. FOR EXAMPLE, BILLIONAIRE  INDUSTRIALIST AND MY FUTURE FACE  TWIN CHARLES KOCH IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WICHITA  EAGLE, THE CUTE KOCH SAID HE  WANTS TO ELIMINATE THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE IT CREATES A  CULTURE OF DEPENDENCY AND KEEPS  PEOPLE WITH LIMITED CAPITAL FROM STARTING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. HE IS RIGHT. HAVING TO PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES  REALLY HURTS SMALL BUSINESS. I MEAN, LOOK AT OUR NATION'S  FOREFATHERS. MANY ARRIVED WITH NOTHING BUT  THE BLOUSE ON THEIR BACK BUT  THANKS TO NO MINIMUM WAGE, THEY STARTED A BOOMING COTTON  INDUSTRY. BUT JUST TRY EXPLAINING MACRO  ECONOMICS TO THE 10.4 MILLION  WORKING POOR. SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY THINK THE  MINIMUM WAGE IS TOO LOW  ESPECIALLY THE FOUR MILLION WHO WORK IN FAST FOOD. JIM?
SINCE EARLY APRIL, THERE HAVE  BEEN PROTESTS BY FAST FOOD  WORKERS IN SEVEN CITIES.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE ON  WHAT WE MAKE.
A COALITION OF GROUPS CALLING  THEMSELVES D15 HELPED ORGANIZE  THIS PROTEST AND OTHERS AT McDONALD'S, BURGER KING,  DOMINOES AND OTHER TOP CHAINS TO  DEMAND $15 AN HOUR INSTEAD OF  $7.40.
Stephen: $15 AN HOUR? THAT WOULD MAKE THE GUY AT FRY  STATION THE RICHEST MAN IN  DETROIT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I SAY YOUR FRIES ARE READY. I SAY THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT THE  MINIMUM WAGE IS TOO LOW. IT'S THAT THE POORS OUT THERE  DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THEIR  CASH.
MANY OF THE POOR WILL USE THE  MONEY IRRESPONSIBLY.
THERE IS A REASON FOR POVERTY  IN AMERICA. IT'S USUALLY PERSONAL  RESPONSIBILITY.
POVERTY IS NOT JUST AN  ECONOMIC PROBLEM. IT IS A SOCIAL PROBLEM AND A  SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROBLEM. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY PROBLEM. YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: YES, IT DOESN'T  MATTER HOW LITTLE YOU ARE PAID. IF YOU'RE POOR, IT'S YOUR FAULT. I GET THAT. BUT THEN AGAIN I'M NOT POOR AND  IF I WERE, I WOULDN'T BE. BECAUSE I WOULD TURN BEING POOR  INTO AN "OPP-POOR-TUNITY" --  OKAY, TRADEMARK -- AND McDONALD'S AGREES WITH ME. INSTEAD OF RAISING SALARIES  THEY'RE GIVING THEIR WORKERS  SOMETHING MORE VALUABLE THAN MONEY: A WEBSITE.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE'VE  LEARNED IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC  TIMES IT'S TO BUDGET AND SAVE FOR THE FUTURE, RIGHT? WELL, MacDONALD'S THOUGHT IT  WAS HELPING ITS EMPLOYEES BY  GIVING THEM AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO DO JUST THAT ON THEIR LIMITED  SALARIES.
A WEBSITE LAUNCHED BY THE  CHAIN CALLED PRACTICAL MONEY  SKILL +O9R3 LIFE. THE SITE BREAKS DOWN ON A WORKER  CAN MAKE ENDS MEET ON A  McDONALD'S SALARY SNEF YES NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THEIR  DELICIOUS BURGER RECIPE WHICH  MAKES END MEAT. AND TAKE A Mc-LOOK AT THEIR  Mc-NUGGETS OF Mc-WISDOM. Mc-JIM.
EVEN SMALL THINGS ADD UP TO A  LOT OF MONEY OVER TIME. THINK OF IT THIS WAY. LET'S SAY YOU GO TO THE  CONVENIENCE STORE EVERYDAY FOR  GUM OR EVEN A CANDY BAR MPLE IT'S ONLY A DOLLAR, RIGHT? WELL, IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT  DOLLAR A DAY TIMES 365 DAYS A  YEAR, YOU'RE SPENDING $365 A YEAR ON SNACKS ALONE.
Stephen: HOLD ON. ONE SECOND. LET ME SEE. 365 TIMES... YES, YES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TIMES ONE. IT CHECKED OUT. NOW, FOLKS, THE HEART OF THE  PROGRAM IS THIS DOWNLOADABLE  BUDGET JOURNAL WORKERS CAN USE TO TRACK THEIR SPENDING.
WRITING DOWN AND JOURNALING  YOUR DAILY SPENDING WILL HELP  YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE YOUR MONEY  GOES. YOU MIGHT SAY IT'S TOO MUCH  TROUBLE TO WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING  YOU SPEND BUT BEFORE YOU SAY THAT, GIVE IT A TRY. TRY IT FOR ONE WEEK AND SEE IF  YOU NOTICE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR  SPENDING. THEN TRY IT FOR AT LEAST A MONTH  TO SEE THAT YOU REALLY WILL  SPEND LESS.
Stephen: THEN TRY A YEAR. THEN TRY A DECADE. THEN 50 YEARS RM THEN ASK  YOURSELF, WHY AM I STILL WORKING  AT McDONALD'S? I'M 86 YEARS OLD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW  THEIR SAMPLE MONTHLY BUDGET. WHERE THEY ESTIMATE YOU WILL  SPEND $600 ON RENT. $100 ON CABLE AND PHONE, AND $0  ON HEATING. NO PROBLEM. JUST ACCUMULATE A WARMING LAYER  OF FAT ON YOUR BODY LIKE THIS  EMPLOYEE. AND OTHER PARTS OF THEIR SAMPLE  BUDGET ARE EQUALLY HELPFUL. FOR HEALTH INSURANCE THEY BUDGET  $20. NOW THE CHEAPEST MacDONALD'S  HEALTH PLAN IS $50 BUT FOR $20  YOU CAN GET A TOURNICUT, A BOTTLE OF NIGHT TRAIN AND A BITE  STICK. NOW YOU MIGHT BE SAYING TO  YOURSELF, STEPHEN, I CAN'T DO  ALL THIS ON A McDONALD'S  SALARY. WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE RIGHT. BECAUSE THE BUDGET ASSUMES  YOU'RE WORKING A SECOND JOB. WHICH OF COURSE WON'T BE EASY  BUT THAT DOES MEAN TWO CHRISTMAS  PARTIES. JUST BE SURE TO FILL YOUR  POCKETS WITH SHRIMP AND MAYBE A  CAN OF STERNO BECAUSE, REMEMBER, YOU HAVE NO HEAT. AFTER ALL THE EXPENSES HAVE BEEN  PAID YOU'RE STILL LEFT WITH $800  IN MONTHLY SPENDING MONEY FOR ODDS AND ENDERS LIKE CLOTHING,  FOOD, AND GAS: LUCKILY YOUR  POLYESTER McDONALD'S UNIFORM QUALIFIES AS ALL THREE. SO IF YOU WORK TWO JOBS AT 75  HOURS A WEEK AND FOLLOW THIS  BUDGET TO THE LETTER, McDONALD'S NONBINDINGLY  PROMISES YOU'LL HAVE $100 FOR  SAVINGS A MONTH BECAUSE  McDONALD'S SAYS, "YOU CAN HAVE ALMOST ALMOST YOU WANT AS LONG  AS YOU PLAN AHEAD AND SAVE FOR  IT."  UNLESS THE THING YOU WANT IS  MONEY. SO STOP COMPLAINING, FOUR  MILLION FAST FOOD WORKERS. MacDONALD'S MAY HAVE NET A  PROFIT LAST QUARTER OF $1.39  BILLION. BUT YOU GET A FAIR WAGE PLUS ALL  THE GREASE YOU CAN BREATHE. FOR PETE'S SAKE AN EMPLOYEE AT A  CHICAGO McDONALD'S MAKES $8.25  AN HOUR BUT THE CEO OF MacDONALD'S ONLY MAKES $8.75  MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. I MEAN 8.25, 8.75, THEY'RE  PRACTICALLY THE SAME IF YOU  DON'T CARE ABOUT MATH. AND MacDONALD'S BUDGET  PROVES THEY DON'T. WE'LL BE RIGHT
