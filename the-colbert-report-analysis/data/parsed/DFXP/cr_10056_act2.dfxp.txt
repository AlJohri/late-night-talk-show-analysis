( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK. NATION, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SAY, I THINK SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE I KIND OF THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO KNOW, BUT I HAVE LEARNED ABSOLUTELY SO MUCH ABOUT FOOTBALL THIS WEEK. FOR INSTANCE, IN FOOTBALL, DRIBBLING IS CALLED FUMBLING, AND GETS YOU FIRED FROM SPORTS. BUT I'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE SUPERB OWL IS ABOUT SEATTLE AND DENVER, THE NORTHWEST VERSUS THE WEST. GRUNGE VERSUS COUNTRY. PLAID VERSUS OTHER PLAID. ( LAUGHTER ) AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THESE ARE THE BIG CITIES IN AMERICA'S TWO LEGAL POT STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO, WHETHER-- WHETHER YOU'RE FROM THE MILE HIGH CITY OR THE ABSOLUTELY BAKED CITY, YOU WANT TO WIN THIS GAME LIKE IT'S A BOX OF LITTLE DEBBIE SWISS CAKE ROLLS. AND WHO BETTER TO REPRESENT THESE TWO CITIES THAN THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT THESE TWO CITIES, THEIR MAYORS. PLEASE WELCOME THE HONORABLE MAYOR ED MURRAY OF SEATTLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND THE HONORABLE MAYOR MICHAEL HANCOCK OF DENVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. MAYOR. ALL RIGHT. GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN, ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?
YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS THING. MAYOR MURRAY, YOU ARE SEATTLE'S FIRST OPENLY GAY MAYOR. THAT'S A LIFESTYLE I DO NOT COB DON'T. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). , I'M SORRY BUT EVERYONE KNOWS BEING MAYOR IS A CHOICE. ( LAUGHTER ).
AND I'M GLAD SEATTLE MADE THAT CHOICE.
Stephen:  OKAY, GOOD. AND YET, AND YET, YOU DON'T LET THEM VOTE ON WHETHER YOU SHOULD BE GAY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DOUBLE STANDARD. MAYOR HANCOCK, MAYOR HANCOCK, YOU ARE, LIKEWISE, THE OPENLY BLACK MAYOR OF DENVER. NOW, COLORADO-- COLORADO HAS LEGALIZED RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, BUT YOU WANT TO BAN SMOKING IT IN PUBLIC.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  OKAY.
RIGHT.
Stephen:  BUT YOU ALSO SUPPORT ALLOWING BARS THE OPTION TO STAY OPEN LATER.
THAT IS CORRECT, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  OKAY, YOU HEARD HIM, BRONCOS FANS-- IF YOU HAVE A VICTORY RIOT, DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE STONED. DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE DRUNK, OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO THE GAME. MAYOR HANCOCK, ON SUNDAY WHAT, TEAM DO YOU LIKE?
THAT'S AN EASY ONE. THERE AREN'T MANY TEAMS THAT CAN TAKE THE DENVER BRONCOS OUT.
Stephen:  WOW, WOW. WHERE DO YOU FIND THE COURAGE? ( LAUGHTER ) FOR THE MAYOR OF DENVER TO PULL FOR THE BRONCOS, THAT REALLY-- THAT TAKES--
GO, BRONCOS.
Stephen:  IF YOU DON'T MIND, THAT TAKES SOME HUEVOS RANCHEROS.
SEATTLE, SEATTLE IS GOING TO WIN.
Stephen:  THE SEATTLE MARINERS.
NO, NO, THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS.
Stephen:  FEBRUARY BETTER THE SEA HAWKS -- THE MARINERS OF FOOTBALL. GENTLEMEN, AS YOU BOTH KNOW, THERE IS A LONG-STANDING SPORTS TRADITION THAT THE MAYORS OF OPPOSING TEAM CITIES TO MAKE A FRIENDLY BET OF THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR CITY. FOR INSTANCE, THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO MIGHT BET A LOAF OF SOURDOUGH BREAD, AND THE MAYOR OF DETROIT MIGHT BET SOMETHING OF EQUAL VALUE, SAY, THE CITY OF DETROIT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO, MAYORS, SO, MAYORS, MAYORS, WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE?
STEPHEN, IN THE VERY UNLIKELY EVENT THAT SEATTLE WOULD BEAT THE DENVER BRONCOS, I'M GOING TO OFFER TO MAYOR MURRAY SOME COLORADO BEEF STEAKS.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NICE. OKAY, MAYOR MURRAY WHAT, ARE YOU PUTTING UP?
WELL, IN THE IMPOSSIBLE EVENT THAT SEATTLE WERE TO LOSE, I'M GOING TO OFFER TO MAYOR HANCOCK SOME INCREDIBLE SALMON FROM THE NORTHWEST.   ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, EXCELLENT. IT'S-- IT'S MEAT AGAINST MEAT. LET'S MAKE THIS WAGER OFFICIAL. GENTLEMEN, GET UP HERE. LET'S SHAKE ON IT. AND-- ( APPLAUSE ) -- HOLD ON! BUSTED! TAKE THEM AWAY. GAMBLING! GAMBLING IS ILLEGAL IN NEW YORK IT STATE. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. YEAH! HAVE FUN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAVE FUN SAYING HIGH TO YOUR DOOBIE FRIENDS IN JAIL. FOLKS, I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. I MEAN, I'M WEARING A WIRE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
