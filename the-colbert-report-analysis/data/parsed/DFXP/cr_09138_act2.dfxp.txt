(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY! FOLKS IT'S VACATION SEASON AND I  HATE TO ADMIT THIS BUT I HATE  WHEN T WAY AMERICANS ARE PERCEIVED WHEN VISITING THE OLD  COUNTRY. I WANT THOSE FILTHY GARLIC  EATERS TO LIKE US. (LAUGHTER)  NATURALLY, I WAS UPSET TO LEARN  THAT ITALIANS WERE THROWING A  HISSSY FIT ABOUT AN INNOCENT MISTAKE AT ONE OF THEIR MUSEUMS.
AS IF AMERICAN TOURISTS  DIDN'T HAVE A BAD REPUTATION  ALREADY, NOW THERE IS THIS. A MISSOURI MAN TRAVELING IN  ITALY ACCIDENTALLY SNAPPED THE  FINGER OFF A 600-YEAR-OLD  STATUE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  AN AMERICAN TOURIST IN HOT  WATER. THEY'RE KNOCKING A FINGER OFF A  600-YEAR-OLD STATUE AT A MUSEUM  IN FLORENCE.
PART OF THE STORY IS IS TO  REPAIR THE DAMAGED FINGER.
Stephen: ITALY, IF YOUR  RESTORERS NEED A MODEL FOR THAT  FINGER, I GOT ONE RIGHT HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHO CARES IF A 600-YEAR-OLD  STATUE'S FINGER SNAPPED OFF? JUST REPLACE IT WITH ONE OF  ITALY'S FAMED UNLIMITED BREAD  STICKS. (LAUGHTER)  OR HAVE WE FORGOTTEN  HOSPITALIANO? (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, IF ANYONE IS TO BLAME FOR  THIS IT IS THE STAT STAT STAT,  FOR ONE THING, WHAT IS AN OPERA MUSEUM DOING WITH STATUES? EVERYONE IS CALLING THIS A  PRICELESS ART WORK, SO WHAT'S  THE BIG DEAL? IF IT'S TREE, JUST GET ANOTHER  ONE. (LAUGHTER)  NATURALLY THE MUSEUM'S DIRECTOR  BLAMES THE TOURIST SAYING "IN A  GLOBALIZED ECONOMY --" (LAUGHTER)  HAITI MAMA! NORMALLY, YOU DON'T TOUCH THE  WORKS BUT LOOK AT THE STATUE. THE GUY'S BEEN WAITING FOR A  HIGH FIVE SINCE THE 1400s! YOU CANNOT LEAVE A BRO HANGING! BESIDES, THE AMERICAN TOURIST  HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD  EXPLANATION.
ACCORDING TO REPORT, THE MAN  WAS MEASURING THE FINGER AND  COMPARING IT TO HIS OWN HAND WHEN HE ACCIDENTALLY BROKE THE  WORK OF ART.
Stephen: YES, THAT IS THE  WHOLE REASON MUSEUMS EXIST: SO  YOU CAN COMPARE YOURSELF TO THE  ART. THAT'S WHY THE FIRST TIME I SAW  MIKE LANG LOW'S DAVID I DROPPED  TROU CRAWLED UP THERE -- (LAUGHTER)  DID A LITTLE SIDE-BY-SIDE  COMPARISON. AND I DON'T WANT TO SHOCK ANYONE  BUT --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I DON'T WANT TO SHOCK ANYONE. LET'S JUST SAY HE MET THE REAL  GOLIATH. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
