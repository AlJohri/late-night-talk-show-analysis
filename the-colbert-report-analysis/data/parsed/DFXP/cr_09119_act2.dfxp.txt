HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, IN JUST A FEW MINUTES, WE  WILL HAVE MORE ON THE SUPREME  COURT DECLARING THE END OF  RACISM. BUT THE OTHER BIT OF JUICY  JUSTICE I'VE GOT MY EYE ON IS  THE TRIAL OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN. HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE. THE FESTIVITIES KICKED OFF  YESTERDAY IN FLORIDA. NOW, WE ALL REMEMBER HOW  ZIMMERMAN SHOT UNARMED TEENAGER  TRAYVON MARTIN IN WHAT WAS EITHER A SENSELESS TRAGEDY OR A  SENSIBLE RESPONSE TO AGGRAVATED  HOODIE. THIS STORY, FOLKS, HAS TORN THIS  NATION APART BUT LUCKILY  ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER DON WEST IN HIS OPENING REMARKS STARTED THE  HEALING WITH HUMOR.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LAUGH  TO KEEP FROM CRYING. SO LET ME, AT CONSIDERABLE RISK,  LET ME SAY, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU  A LITTLE JOKE. I KNOW HOW THAT MAY SOUND A BIT  WEIRD IN THIS CONTEXT UNDER  THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT I THINK YOU'RE THE PERFECT  AUDIENCE FOR IT. AS LONG AS YOU... IF YOU DON'T  LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T THINK IT'S  FUNNY OR IT'S INAPPROPRIATE THAT YOU DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST  MR. ZIMMERMAN. YOU CAN HOLD IT AGAINST ME IF  YOU WANT. BUT I HAVE YOUR ASSURANCE YOU  WON'T. HERE'S HOW IT GOES. KNOCK, KNOCK. WHO'S THERE? GEORGE ZIMMERMAN. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WHO? ALL RIGHT. GOOD. YOU'RE ON THE JURY. NOTHING? THAT'S FUNNY.
Stephen: COME ON. THAT IS SOME GRADE-A,  LIGHT-HEARTED MURDER TRIAL  HUMOR. I THINK THIS IS A SHREWD MOVE BY  ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER. AMERICA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF  MURDER HUMOR. I MEAN, WHO CAN FORGET DURING  THE O.J. TRIAL WHEN JOHNNIE  COCHRAN BLEW UP THAT GLOVE AND PUT IT OVER HIS HEAD? "IF THE GLOVE FIT ON MY HEAD, HE  DIDN'T MAKE HER DEAD."  YOU KNOW IT. I KNOW IT. HE KNOWS IT. SHE KNOWS IT. AND IN "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD,"  ATTICUS FINCH KNEW THAT A LITTLE  HUMOR COULD HEALTH THE HEARTS OF EVEN THE MOST HARDENED RACISTS.
IN THE NAME OF GOD, DO YOUR  DUTY. NOTHING? I SAID DUTY. COME ON. THAT'S FUNNY.
Stephen: I ALWAYS CRY AT THAT  PART. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
