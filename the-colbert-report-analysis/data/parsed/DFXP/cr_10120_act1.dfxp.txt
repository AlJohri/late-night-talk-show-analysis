U-S-A. U-S-A. U-S-A! OLE! OLE! OLE!. U-S-A! OLE! OLE! OLE! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." POW! THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." FOLKS, I WANT TO START OFF TONIGHT BY SAYING HELLO AND GRACIAS FOR JOINING US OR HOWEVER BRAZILIANS SAY "GRACIAS" IN PORTUGUESE BECAUSE LAST NIGHT IN BRAZIL AT THE WORLD CUP AMERICA WON A SOCCER.
A WORLD CUP VICTORY FOR TEAM U.S.A.
THE DRAMATIC GAME THAT HAD THE WHOLE NATION CHEERING.
TEAM U.S.A. DEFEATING GHANA 2-1.
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE CELEBRATING THIS MORNING.
WE HAVE SOCCER FEVER.
Stephen: YES, WE HAVE SOCCER FEVER, AND ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF SOCCER FEVER IS VICTORY FOOT. U-S-A! OLE! OLE! OLE!. FOLKS, THIS IS A HUGE DAY FOR AMERICA'S SPORTS FANS, WHO HAVE BEEN EXCITED ABOUT THE WORLD CUP EVER SINCE THEY NOTICED IT WAS HAPPENING, WHICH WAS SHORTLY AFTER THE NBA FINALS ENDED ON SUNDAY. [LAUGHTER] NOW, IT'S NO SECRET, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A SOCCER FAN. AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE SAID SOCCER IS AS EXCITING AS WATCHING DRYING PAINT PLAY MANILA ENVELOPES TO A 0-0 TIE, BUT I WAS JUST BEING HARD ON SOCCER BECAUSE I LOVE IT. I WANTED IT TO GET BETTER AND IT DID. YOU'RE WELCOME.
FOLKS, THIS WAS A THRILLER OF A MATCH. TEAM U.S.A.'S CLINT DEMPSEY STUNNED GHANA WITH A GOAL IN THE OPENING 29 SECONDS, WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS' ATTENTION SPAN FOR SOCCER IS 30 SECONDS. OLE, OLE, OLE, OLE! UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO COPYRIGHT ISSUES, I CANNOT SHOW YOU MORE THAN 15 SECONDS OF WORLD CUP VIDEO, BUT WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO BRING YOU ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF THE BIG MOMENT.
THAT PITCH LOOKS SUPERB. IT'S A BIT HARD, THOUGH, ISN'T IT?
THE PLAYERS WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW IF IT IS GOING TO RAIN TONIGHT, THEY WERE WATERING THIS BEFORE THE GAME, AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PICK THE RIGHT FOOTWEAR BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD THAT IT'S WET ON TOP.
DEMPSEY. GREAT SHOT. DEMPSEY SCORES! [CHEERING]
Stephen: GREAT MOMENT. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT FOR DEMPSEY. SADLY HE FORGOT ABOUT IT SEVEN SECONDS LATER. NOW, THAT GOAL WAS FOLLOWED BY AN INCREDIBLE LATE-GAME HEADER BY SUBSTITUTE JOHN BROOKS TO WIN IT.
WHAT ABOUT THAT? IT'S JOHN BROOKS. QUITE INCREDIBLE. HE COULDN'T EVEN HAVE DREAMT THAT. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: OH, NO, ENGLISH ACCENT GUY?
I HAD A DREAM LIKE TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT I SCORED IN THE 88th MINUTE, AND NOW IT'S THE 86th MINUTE.
YOU HAD A DREAM ABOUT THAT?
I HAD A DREAM.
Stephen: HE HAD A DREAM. HE IS THE MARTIN LUTHER KING OF SOCCER. FREE KICK AT, LAST FREE KICK AT LAST, THANK GOD ALMIGHTY, FREE KICK AT LAST. AFTER THE VICTORY, FANS ACROSS AMERICA WENT WILD, AND OF COURSE THE TEAM CELEBRATED THE TRADITIONAL SOCCER WAY BY LOADING INTO MOM'S MINIVAN AND HEADING TO PIZZA HUT WHERE JOHN BROOKS CONTINUED HIS HOT STREAK ON MRS. PACMAN. GO, U.S.A.! NOW, NATION, MY SOCCER TEAM ISN'T THE ONLY REASON I'M FEELING LIKE A WINNER. ONE WEEK AGO TODAY HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AND LENSCRAFTERS MODEL UNDERSTUDY ERIC CANTOR LOST HIS PRIMARY RACE TO AN UNKNOWN TEA PARTIER, DAVID BRAT. NOW THAT CANTOR IS OUT AS MAJORITY LEADER, CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALREADY STARTED THE RACE TO REPLACE HIM. MY PREDICTION FOR THAT RACE: WHITE. BUT, FOLKS, CANTOR'S DOWNFALL HIGHLIGHTS A PROBLEM FOR THE RNC.
HIS SUPPORT FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM IS THE KEY REASON BEHIND HIS DEFEAT.
VOTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT IF ERIC CANTOR WENT BACK TO WASHINGTON, THAT WAS A GREEN LIGHT FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM.
ERIC CANTOR WAS ACCUSED OF RUSHING TOWARDS A REFORM PROGRAM THAT HIS OPPONENT LABELED "AMNESTY."
Stephen: YES, HE SUPPORTED AMNESTY. YOU MESS WITH THE BULL, YOU GET THE HORNS, AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S A RODEO BULL METAPHOR, NOT A BULL-FIGHTING METAPHOR. I WANT TO KEEP MY JOB. SADLY, IT TURNS OUT A LOT OF THE MATADORS HAVE BEEN VOTING.
YOU HAVE HISPANICS, YOU KNOW, VOTING IN LARGER AND LARGER NUMBERS.
IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ELECTING A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 2016, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO APPEAL TO HISPANIC VOTERS.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL TICKET WITH HISPANIC APPEAL, LIKE TED CRUZ AND SOMEBODY APPEALING? WE'LL WORK ON IT. WE'LL WORK ON IT. [APPLAUSE] FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THERE IS A WAY FOR THE GRAND OLD PARTY TO WIN OVER HISPANICS WITHOUT BECOMING UN GRANDE' EL POLLO'. AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S "WORD." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A DARKER SHADE OF PALE. REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES MAY NOT POLL WELL WITH HISPANICS, BUT THERE IS ONE GROUP WHO HAS ALWAYS GIVEN THEM SUPPORT. AND THAT GROUP IS WHITE GUYS. IN FACT, IN 2012, 62% OF WHITE MEN VOTED FOR MITT ROMNEY. THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS SHOULD HAVE LED TO AN AWKWARD, REGRETTABLE VICTORY DANCE, BUT THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE G.O.P. IT TURNS OUT THAT A STUDY BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER OF THE LAST U.S. CENSUS ANALYZED THE RESPONSES TO TWO KEY QUESTIONS: ONE, ARE YOU OF HISPANIC, LATINO OR SPANISH ORIGIN, AND, TWO, WHAT IS YOUR RACE? NOW, THOSE TWO QUESTIONS MIGHT SEEM REALLY SIMILAR, SO THE ANSWERS ARE KIND OF TRICKY.
SO WHEN THE PEW PEOPLE STUDIED THE ANSWERS, THEY NOTICED SOMETHING INTERESTING. 2.5 MILLION AMERICANS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS HISPANIC AND SOME OTHER RACE IN 2000, TEN YEARS LATER, IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS HISPANIC AND WHITE, MEANING HISPANICS ARE VOLUNTARILY BECOMING WHITE. THEY'RE SAYING, ADIOS, CINCO DE MAYO, AND HELLO, CINCO DE MAYO. AND I DO NOT BLAME HISPANICS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DO NOT BLAME HISPANICS FOR BECOMING WHITE. YOU SEE, WHITE PEOPLE, WHITE PEOPLE GET TO LIVE IN THE BEST NEIGHBORHOODS, GET THE BEST JOBS, APPROPRIATE THE BEST MUSIC. AND I BELIEVE THIS PROVES THAT BEING WHITE IS A CHOICE. ONE I MAKE EVERY DAY. IT SHOWS IN THE WAY I DRESS, THE WAY I DANCE, THE WAY I OWN A BOAT. SO I SPEAK FOR ALL PEOPLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE I SPEAK FOR ALL WHITE PEOPLE WHEN I SAY, "WELCOME, TRANS-CAUCASIANS." I MYSELF AM CIS-WHITE. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH MY BIRTH RACE, BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR ALL OF YOU IN THE WHITE COMMUNITY. AND HERE'S THE THING, YOU ARE NOT ALONE. HISPANICS ARE JUST THE LATEST IMMIGRANT GROUP TO BECOME WHITE. I MEAN, THESE DAYS MANY PEOPLE EVEN CONSIDER ITALIANS TO BE WHITE. BUT WE CANNOT... I BELIEVE AS A NATION WE CANNOT STOP AT HISPANICS. THE G.O.P. IS A TENT BIG ENOUGH FOR ANYONE WILLING TO CALL THEMSELVES WHITE -- ASIANS, INDIANS, BLACKS, WHATEVER BRUNO MARS IS. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO IT, REPUBLICANS DON'T STRUGGLE ONLY WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES. THEY ALSO STRUGGLE WITH GENDER MAJORITIES. LIKE IN 2012 WHEN 55% OF WOMEN VOTED FOR OBAMA. SO, LADIES, YOU ARE WELCOME TO JOIN US, TOO. ALL YOU HAVE DO IS IDENTIFY AS MALE, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS THE WHITE OF GENDERS. AND ONCE EVERYONE STARTS SEEING THEMSELVES AS WHITE MALES, CONSERVATIVES CAN APPEAL TO THEM BY POINTING OUT THAT THEY ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM THE PEOPLE THEY USED TO BE. THEY'LL KNOW WHICH SIDE THEIR BREAD IS BUTTERED ON. SO PLEASE, JOIN US, HISPANICS, BECAUSE ONCE EVERYONE IS WHITE, THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING TO FIGHT OVER. AND THAT'S "THE WORD." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
