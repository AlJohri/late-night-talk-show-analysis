(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: YEAH! WHOO! WHOO! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, NATION! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL, CRISP FALL TUESDAY NIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM SAMSON AND YOUR CHEERING IS MY LONG HAIR! THANKS FOR BEING HERE! NATION, I AM A HUGE FAN OF THE GAME OF FOOTED-BALL. EVERY SUNDAY, I INVITE MY BROS OVER, GRILL UP SOME BRATS, CRACK A COUPLE OF COLD ONES, FORGET TO TAKE THE BRATS OFF THE GRILL, BURN DOWN MY HOUSE, APOLOGIZE TO MY BROS, AND HOLD A VIGIL FOR LENNY. (LAUGHTER) SO NATURALLY, I'M ALL OVER THE HUGE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING LAST NIGHT'S GAME BETWEEN THE -- OH, SHOOT -- I CAN NEVER REMEMBER THE TEAMS' NAMES. LET'S SAY THE NEW ENGLAND... BIG GUYS VERSUS THE KANSAS CITY -- UH -- CHIEFS. OH, THE NAME OF THE TEAM IS ACTUALLY THE CHIEFS? GOOD TO KNOW. THANKS... UH, BUDDY. JIM?
N.F.L. REFEREES CALLING A 15-YARD UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT PENALTY ON CHIEFS SAFETY HUSAIN ABDULLAH FOR DROPPING TO HIS KNEES IN PRAYER AFTER SCORING A TOUCHDOWN ON MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. ABDULLAH'S A DEVOUT MUSLIM. HE WAS PRACTICING THE SAJDA, A RELIGIOUS PRAYER.
STEPHEN: A MUSLIM PRAYER IN THE END ZONE. AND EVEN MORE SHOCKING -- I WAS ALLOWED TO PLAY FOOTAGE WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. SOMETHING'S VERY, VERY WRONG! I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WERE MUSLIM FOOTBALL PLAYERS. HOW CAN THEY PLAY IF THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH PIGSKIN? (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? WE'LL HAVE TO SWITCH TO HALAL BALLS. (LAUGHTER) BUT THERE'S AN EVEN BIGGER SCANDAL THAN A MUSLIM BEING PENALIZED FOR HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS -- THE N.F.L. SAID THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. (LAUGHTER) THEY RELEASED A STATEMENT THIS MORNING SAYING THAT THE REFEREE "IS NOT TO FLAG A PLAYER WHO GOES TO THE GROUND AS PART OF A RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION AND, AS A RESULT, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NO PENALTY ON THE PLAY." NO PENALTY ON THE PLAY? HOW ABOUT HOLDING... THE WRONG RELIGIOUS BELIEFS? (LAUGHTER) OKAY? WE ALL KNOW FOOTBALL IS A CHRISTIAN SPORT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PLAYS LIKE "THE HAIL MARY" AND "THE LATERAL JUDAS." AND, IN FOOTBALL, WE THANK ONLY JESUS. TIM TEBOW  WAS SO GOOD AT IT, WE STARTED CALLING PRAYING "TEBOWING." THOUGH THESE DAYS, "TEBOWING" MEANS BAGGING GROCERY AT A SAFEWAY. (LAUGHTER) LET ME EXPLAIN THE NATION'S GAME TO YOU. FOOTBALL WORKS LIKE THIS PLAYERS THANK JESUS AFTER EVERY TOUCHDOWN. THEN WHOEVER WINS IS THE TEAM JESUS LOVED MORE. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO ANGER GOD, BUT IT'S TIME TO APOLOGIZE. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW WITH MUSLIMS IN THE END ZONE, ALL THAT'S CHANGED. DON'T GET ME WRONG -- I'M ALL FOR PITTING CHRISTIANITY AGAINST ISLAM TO FIND OUT WHO HAS THE BEST GOD. (LAUGHTER) MY MONEY'S ON THE J-MAN. WHENEVER HIS ELECTROLYTES ARE LOW, HE CAN TURN WATER INTO GATORADE. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHERE DOES IT END? HOW MANY OTHER RELIGIOUS CELEBRATIONS WILL WE BE FORCED TO WATCH IN THE END ZONE? DRUID PLAYERS PLANTING A TREE? BUDDHIST PLAYERS RELEASING A BOX TURTLE? SCIENTOLOGISTS GIVING THE OTHER TEAM A STRESS TEST? BOTTOM LINE, THIS WILL -- (APPLAUSE) BOTTOM LINE, THIS WILL COMPLETELY RUIN THE GAME OF FOOTBALL. AND THAT JOB IS ALREADY FILLED BY ROGER GOODELL. (LAUGHTER) NATION, THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER, WHERE IT IS WAITING TO HIT AMERICA WITH A BOARD THAT HAS NAILS STICKING OUT OF IT. REPUBLICANS ARE ALREADY WARMING UP FOR THE BIG FIGHT. LAST WEEKEND THEY GATHERED FOR THE 9TH ANNUAL "VALUES VOTER SUMMIT." A FOUR-DAY ORGY OF PEOPLE FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO ORGIES. (LAUGHTER) THERE WERE SO MANY GREAT SPEAKERS, AND ALSO SARAH PALIN, WHO URGED THE AUDIENCE TO NEVER BACK DOWN.
THEY SCREAM RACISM JUST TO END DEBATE. WELL, DON'T RETREAT. YOU RELOAD WITH TRUTH, WHICH I KNOW IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES AT, UH, 1400 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, ANYWAY. TRUTH. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: YES, TRUTH IS IN SHORT SUPPLY AT 1400 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. (LAUGHTER) EVERYONE THERE KEEPS INSISTING IT'S A PLAZA IN FRONT OF THE WILLARD HOTEL. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU WON'T HEAR ANY OF THAT FROM THE LIBERAL NBC NEWS OVER AT 20 ROCK. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE VALUES VOTER SUMMIT HOLDS THE FIRST BIG STRAW POLL OF EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THIS YEAR'S WINNER WAS TED CRUZ WHO SURGED TO 25% OF THE VOTE UP FROM 42% IN 2013. (LAUGHTER) TED CRUZ, TO KNOW HIM IS TO "EH." (LAUGHTER) BUT WHEN IT COMES TO 2016, I'M JINDAL ALL THE WAY. GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL FINISHED A STRONG FOURTH IN THE STRAW POLL AND I'M NOT SURPRISED. BOBBY JINDAL'S A TWO-TERM GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA, A CHAMPION OF SMALL BUSINESS, AND STARTING THIS YEAR, HE'S ALLOWED TO STAY OUT PAST 11:00. UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S GOT A FEW SKELETONS IN HIS CLOSET. HE'S A RHODES SCHOLAR WITH A MASTERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM OXFORD, AND HE RAN THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA SYSTEM. HE'S AN ACADEMIC, OR AS ONE SENIOR CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST DESCRIBED HIM...  (YELLING INCOHERENTLY) YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO HAUNT HIM! (APPLAUSE) AND LAST YEAR JINDAL LECTURED THE BASE ABOUT THE G.O.P.'S ELECTORAL PROBLEMS.
WE HAVE GOT TO STOP INSULTING THE INTELLIGENCE OF VOTERS. WE NEED TO TRUST THE SMARTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO STOP BEING THE STUPID PARTY
STEPHEN: WELL, I SAY, IF BEING SO STUPID YOU CAN'T COMPLETE A METAPHOR IS WRONG, THEN MAKE LEMONADE! (LAUGHTER) AND JINDAL'S PRO-KNOWLEDGE AGENDA HAS HURT HIS POPULARITY. IN RECENT CNN, ORC, WNBA POLL OF NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICANS, JINDAL GOT ONLY 3% OF RESPONDENTS, TIED WITH RICK SANTORUM, AND FALLING JUST SHORT OF "NO ONE" AT 4%, WHICH I SAY HE CAN USE TO HIS ADVANTAGE. JINDAL 2016:  NO ONE IS MORE POPULAR! (LAUGHTER) THIS MAN'S GOING ALL THE WAY. BUT RECENTLY, JINDAL SET OUT TO CONVINCE PEOPLE HE'S A DOWN-HOME GUY WHO'S LEARNED TO STOP LEARNING.
DO YOU PERSONALLY BELIEVE THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION EXPLAINS THE PRESENCE OF COMPLEX LIFE ON EARTH?
LOOK, THE REALITY IS I WAS NOT AN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST.
STEPHEN: YES, THE REALITY IS HE WAS NOT AN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST. HE JUST GRADUATED FROM BROWN UNIVERSITY WITH AN HONORS DEGREE IN BIOLOGY. (LAUGHTER) BUT COME ON! NOBODY USES THEIR COLLEGE DEGREE IN REAL LIFE. I WENT TO DARTMOUTH BUT I DON'T USE MY DEGREE IN -- "DIPLOMA WITHHELD DUE TO OUTSTANDING LIBRARY BOOK." I CAN'T GET A JOB WITH THAT. TRUE STORY, BY THE WAY. AND JINDAL KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE HANDICAPPED BY KNOWLEDGE, SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER THE SAME FATE.
I WANT MY KIDS TO BE TAUGHT ABOUT EVOLUTION IN THEIR SCHOOL. WHAT I BELIEVE AS A FATHER AND A HUSBAND IS THAT LOCAL SCHOOLS SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW THEY TEACH. I THINK LOCAL DISTRICTS SHOULD MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THEIR CLASSROOMS.
STEPHEN: EXACTLY. JINDAL BELIEVES EVOLUTION SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED SCIENCE ONLY ON A "LOCAL" BASIS. TAKE THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS. ON ONE OF THEM, THE FINCHES EVOLVED LONGER BEAKS TO PUNCH HOLES IN CACTUS FRUIT. ON ANOTHER ISLAND, THE BEAKS WERE SHORTER BECAUSE JESUS. AND JINDAL IS OFF TO AN IMPRESSIVE RETREAT FROM KNOWLEDGE. BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE SCIENCE HE CAN RUN AWAY FROM. FOR EXAMPLE, HE SHOULD INSIST THAT THUNDER IS JUST GOD BOWLING, AND LIGHTNING IS GOD GETTING HIS PICTURE TAKEN WITH HIS BOWLING TROPHY. AND YES, I REALIZE THAT THE  LIGHTNING COMES BEFORE THE THUNDER, WHICH WOULD MEAN GOD GOT HIS TROPHY JUST BEFORE PLAYING HIS GAME. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY -- GOD BOWLS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. SO I APPLAUD BOBBY JINDAL FOR DEFTLY FLOATING HIS PRESIDENTIAL TRIAL BALLOON. BUT DON'T CALL IT THAT, BECAUSE THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON BALLOONING YET. I MEAN, IF HOT AIR RISES, HOW COME HELL IS BELOW US? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
