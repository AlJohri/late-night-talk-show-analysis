Stephen: TONIGHT, DID THE C.I.A. GO TOO FAR TO FIGHT TERRORISM? IF YOU ANSWERED YES, THE DRONES ARE ON THE WAY! (LAUGHTER) THEN STANDARDIZED TESTS GET AN UPDATE. READING COMPREHENSION WILL NOW BE LIMITED TO 140 CHARACTERS! (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST DAME JANE GOODALL HAS A NEW BOOK, SEEDS OF HOPE, WISDOM AND WONDER FROM THE  WORLD OF PLANTS. JOKE'S ON HER, IT'S PRINTED ON DEAD PLANTS. FBI DOCUMENTS ALLEGE AL SHARPTON WAS A MOB INFORMANT. HE MUST  HAVE JOINED MSNBC AS PART OF THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM. THIS IS THE "THE COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NATION, IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE VLADIMIR PUTIN ANNEXED CRIMEA AND PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL REFUSES TO INTERVENE. WE HAVE GOT TO INVADE BEFORE PUTIN'S SLAVE ARMY VANQUISHES ALL OF EUROPE ON HIS WAY TO WESTOROS. FULL DISCLOSURE -- I MAY HAVE BEEN FLIPPING BETWEEN FOX NEWS AND "GAME OF THRONES" THE OTHER NIGHT, BUT I STILL SAY, PUTIN HAS DRAGONS! (LAUGHTER) IT'S BELIEVABLE. NOW, YOU MAY SAY, STEPHEN, AMERICANS HAVE NO VESTED INTEREST HERE BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO A NEW "WASHINGTON POST" POLL, ONLY "ONE OUT OF SIX AMERICANS CAN FIND UKRAINE ON A MAP," ALTHOUGH TWO FOUND WALDO. BUT THE SAME EXACT POLL FOUND "THE LESS AMERICANS KNOW ABOUT UKRAINE'S LOCATION, THE MORE THEY WANT THE U.S. TO INTERVENE." DAMN STRAIGHT! THIS IS AMERICA! WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHERE A COUNTRY IS TO SEND TROOPS THERE. YEAH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, EVENTUALLY, YOU WANT TO CHECK GOOGLE MAPS, BUT AFTER YOU GIVE THE ORDER. BESIDES, WHY DON'T I KNOW WHERE THAT COUNTRY IS? WHAT IS IT HIDING? IN FACT, THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES I'D LIKE TO INVADE FOR NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE -- PARAGUAY, UZBEKISTAN, WHEREVER THE HELL MY KEYS ARE. SEE, FOLKS, I BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO GEOGRAPHY. THE UKRAINE IS WHEREVER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAY IT IS. AND ACCORDING TO THIS POLL, AMERICANS SAY IT'S EVERYWHERE -- (APPLAUSE) ALL THOSE DOTS ARE GUESSES WHERE IT IS, OKAY? EVIDENTLY, THERE'S SOME UKRAINE IN GREENLAND, A BIT OF UKRAINE IN AFRICA, THERE'S EVEN SOME UKRAINE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. WHICH IS THE ONLY UKRAINE CNN IS WILLING TO COVER RIGHT NOW. MOST ALARMING, THERE'S SOME UKRAINE IN IOWA, WHICH MEANS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE PUTIN INVADES AND THEN WINS THE G.O.P. STRAW POLL -- WITH DRAGONS! (LAUGHTER) GOODBYE, PEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, YOU CANNOT TRUST MAPS. THEY'RE ALWAYS CHANGING THEIR STORY. ONE DAY IT'S PANGEA, 300 MILLION YEARS LATER IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. C'MON! MAKE UP YOUR MIND! IS ALASKA UP "HERE"? OR IS IT TUCKED UNDER ARIZONA NEXT TO HAWAII? (LAUGHTER) I WENT TO THE IDITAROD LAST YEAR AND PACKED NOTHING BUT A SPEEDO. SO, BRAVO, AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT THE UKRAINE CRISIS, THE MORE YOU'RE WILLING TO USE MILITARY FORCE. SO I'LL DO MY PART AND GO BACK TO NOT COVERING IT. (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THE C.I.A. NO LONGER HAS AN ENHANCED INTERROGATION PROGRAM. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ASSURED OF IT BY THE PEOPLE WHO SAID WE NEVER HAD ONE. SOME PEOPLE STILL WHINE ABOUT IT, BUT LIKE A DETAINEE IN A STRESS POSITION, THESE CRITICS DON'T HAVE A LEG TO STAND ON. BECAUSE ENHANCED INTERROGATION WORKED.
THE STEPS WE TOOK, INCLUDING, I THINK, THINGS LIKE ENHANCED INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES, MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US ULTIMATELY TO PROVIDE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS REQUIRED TO TAKE DOWN BIN LADEN.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE CONDUCTED THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION PROGRAM, YOU'VE GOT TO BE WILLING TO SAY HOW MANY AMERICAN LIVES WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN WILLING TO PUT AT RISK BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WATERBOARD KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED.
ANYBODY WHO'S SEEN "OH DARK THIRTY," KNOWS THAT THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD ARGUMENTS THAT THOSE INTERROGATIONS GAVE US A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION.
Stephen: THAT UNDERINFLATED MACY'S BALLOON IS RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) ANYONE WHO'S SEEN "OH DARK THIRTY "-- AS NO ONE CALLS IT -- KNOWS THAT TORTURE GAVE US A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION THAT LED DIRECTLY TO BIN LADEN. THE SAME WAY ANYONE WHO'S SEEN "FORREST GUMP" SNOWS THE VIETNAM WAR LED DIRECTLY TO BUBBA GUMP'S SHRIMP SHACK MAC AND CHEESE! (LAUGHTER) LEARN YOUR HISTORY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT LAST WEEK NEWS LEAKED OF A SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT THAT IS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE INTERROGATION PROGRAM. ONE OFFICIAL SUMMARIZED THE REPORT, SAYING -- "THE C.I.A. DESCRIBED ITS PROGRAM... AS GETTING UNIQUE, OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE INTELLIGENCE THAT HELPED DISRUPT TERRORIST PLOTS AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES... WAS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE? THE ANSWER IS NO ." HOW MANY (BLEEP) DO I GIVE? THE ANSWER IS NONE. BECAUSE WE "DID" LEARN VALUABLE INFORMATION FROM THIS PROGRAM. WE LEARNED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS WILLING TO TORTURE PEOPLE. I DID NOT KNOW THAT! FORMER C.I.A. DIRECTOR AND GROWNUP PARANOID CHARLIE BROWN, MICHAEL HAYDEN DEFENDED THE PROGRAM ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY, SAYING THAT TORTURE WASN'T JUST ABOUT GETTING THE FACTS.
THE REPORT SAYS THAT INFORMATION ABOUT BIN LADEN'S COURIER CAME FROM A DETAINEE WHILE HE WAS BEING QUESTIONED BY KURDS IN NORTHERN IRAQ LONG BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN TO A CIA PRISON AND GIVEN ENHANCED INTERROGATION.
CHRIS, I AM AWARE THAT SIMPLY LEARNING A FACT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS LEARNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT FACT.
Stephen: EXACTLY, THE C.I.A. MAY HAVE ALREADY KNOWN THE NAME OF BIN LADEN'S COURIER, BUT THAT INFORMATION DIDN'T SOUND IMPORTANT UNTIL IT WAS BEING SCREAMED THROUGH A WET RAG. (LAUGHTER) POINT IS... WHAT WAS THE POINT?
DIRECTOR PANETTA, WHEN ASKED BY THE CONGRESS TO COMMENT ON "DID THE INTERROGATION PROGRAM HELP WITH GETTING US TO ABBOTABAD," SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS PART OF THE INFORMATION, PART OF THE INTELLIGENCE STREAM THAT LED TO THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN AT ABBOTABAD. DIRECTOR PANETTA WENT ON TO SAY, AND WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE MAY HAVE GOTTEN THAT INFORMATION THROUGH ANOTHER WAY, BUT HE DID NOT DENY THAT INFORMATION FROM THIS PROGRAM HELPED PINPOINT BIN LADEN.
Stephen: YES, WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE MAY HAVE GOTTEN THAT INFORMATION ANOTHER WAY. OTHER THAN THE OTHER WAY WE KNOW WE GOT IT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HUGE FANS OF INFORMATION HERE TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WE TORTURED PEOPLE -- AND LATER WE GOT BIN LADEN. THAT'S NOT ME SAYING IT. THAT'S SCIENCE. AND THAT MAD MAN OVER THERE. OKAY? BESIDES, IN THIS COMPLEX WORLD, WHO KNOWS WHAT LEADS TO SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING. IT'S JUST LIKE HOW IF A BUTTERFLY FLAPS ITS WINGS IN THE AMAZON, THAT MIGHT "ALSO" HAVE LED TO BIN LADEN. WE'LL NEVER KNOW UNTIL THE C.I.A. CAPTURES THAT BUTTERFLY AND PULLS ITS WINGS OFF. (LAUGHTER) BUT LOOK, I CAN AGREE WITH ME ALL NIGHT. THERE'S ONLY ONE SURE WAY TO CONFRONT THIS PAINFUL CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY -- NEVER CONFRONT IT. I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT WITH MY FRIENDS FOR YEARS.
WE NEED TO GET THIS BEHIND US.
THIS IS ANCIENT HISTORY NOW, AND WE ADOPTED THIS PROGRAM AND WE SHOULD NOW NOT BE GOING AFTER OR DISPARAGING THE PEOPLE THAT CARRIED IT OUT. (ELSA SINGING "LET IT GO" FROM "FROZEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL SAID, DANA PERINO. AT THIS POINT, THE WHOLE TORTURE DEBATE IS JUST WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE AND UP THE NOSTRIL. AND I GOTTA POINT SOMETHING OUT. WHY IS IT THAT I AND THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED ENHANCED INTERROGATION ARE THE ONLY ONES WILLING TO GET PAST IT? THIS HAS GOT TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT, OTHERS THOUGHT IT WAS WRONG. LET'S MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND NEVER DISCUSS IT AGAIN. THIS IS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP AS A NATION. AND IN A RELATIONSHIP, WHEN SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING SHAMEFUL -- SAY, CHEAT ON YOUR SPOUSE OR CHAIN SOMEONE IN THE BASEMENT OF A CZECH DISCO FOR THREE YEARS -- DO YOU KEEP DREDGING IT UP? NO! YOU TAKE THE PAIN AND YOU STUFF IT DOWN DEEP, ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S FINE AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIVES. THEN TEN YEARS LATER, A LITTLE LEAGUE UMP MAKES A BAD CALL AND YOU GO AT HIM WITH A PLANK FROM THE BLEACHERS. "YOU CALL THAT A STRIKE?! "ARE YOU (BLEEP) BLIND?! IT WAS ONE NIGHT ON A WORK TRIP AND IT MEANT NOTHING TO ME! UNFREEZE YOUR HEART!" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) POINT IS, WE'RE OVER IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
