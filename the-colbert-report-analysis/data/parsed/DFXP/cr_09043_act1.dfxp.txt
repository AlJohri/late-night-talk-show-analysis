Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHOWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. SIT DOWN. WE WILL TOM COT REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING,  FOLKS. I WAS JUST DOWN IN  MY UNDERGROUND BUNKER, MAKING  PREPARATIONS. IT'S BEST THAT I DON'T DIVULGE  TOO MANY DETAILS BECAUSE [WHISPERING] I'M STARTING TO  SUSPECT THIS PLACE IS LOADED  WITH MICROPHONES AND CAMERAS. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, BUT DOWN IN THE BUNKER,  I'M READY FOR THAT DARK TOMORROW  WHEN JACK-BOOTED GOVERNMENT THUGS COME FOR OUR GUNS. THAT'S WHERE THE GHILLIE SUIT  COMES IN. LET'S SAY THE GOVERNMENT BUSTS  IN HERE LOOKING TO ARREST ME  BECAUSE I'M A GUN OWNER AND HAUL ME OFF TO ONE OF THOSE JAILS  WHERE YOU CAN'T BRING YOUR GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, THEY HAVE 'EM. THEY ALREADY HAVE THEM SET UP,  OKAY? THE MINUTE THEY BUST DOWN THAT  DOOR, I JUST DO THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] "HEY, WHERE'S COLBERT?
HE'S NOT HERE. JUST A PILE OF GRASS CLIPPINGS  ON HIS DESK. PERFECTLY NORMAL. AND I'M HOME FREE. YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GET ONE  OF THESE, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE  IT'S SLIMMING. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, TOMORROW IS THE DAY REICH  MARSHAL VON AMTRAK HAS PROMISED  TO ISSUE HIS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GUN CONTROL.
I'M GOING TO BE SUBMITTING TO  THE PRESIDENT A PROPOSAL AS TO  HOW TO PROCEED. I'M SHOOTING FOR TUESDAY. WE ALL KNOW THERE'S NO SILVER  BULLET.
Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] THEY'RE TAKING AWAY OUR SILVER  BULLETS. HOW WILL WE DEFEND OURSELVES  FROM WEREWOLF BANDITS?! [ LAUGHTER ] SO WITH OUR GUNS UNDER ATTACK  WE'RE DEVOTING AN ENTIRE ACT OF  THE SHOW TONIGHT TO A THOUGHTFUL, SENSITIVE  CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS. THIS IS "STEPHEN COLBERT'S  DOUBLE-BARREL BLAM-O-RAMA!" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SADLY, FOLKS, PEOPLE WITH  EXTREME POSITIONS CAN OFTEN  DOMINATE THIS DEBATE. BUT THERE ARE REASONABLE PEOPLE ON BOTH  SIDES, WHO ARE REASONABLY TRYING  TO BLAME ANYTHING BUT GUNS. FOR INSTANCE HOLLYWOOD. JUST LOOK AT HOW MANY OF THIS  YEAR'S OSCAR NOMINEES GLAMORIZE  GUNS:  "DJANGO UNCHAINED," "ZERO DARK THIRTY,"  "ARGO,"  "LINCOLN" AND THE WORST ONE OF  ALL "LES MISERABLES." WHO AMONG US DIDN'T WANT TO  SHOOT RUSSELL CROWE? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND MOVIES AREN'T THE ONLY  CULPRIT. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE MEDIA  OUR KIDS CONSUME. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MEDIA ADULTS  CONSUME?
WHY DOES CONGRESS ALWAYS TAKE  AIM, IF YOU WILL, AT GUNS?
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT  SOCIETY, VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES
THESE ARE MURDER SIMULATORS. THEY REHEARSE THE ACTION.
THE EXTRAORDINARY REALISM TO  VIDEO GAMES AND MOVIES NOW, ET  CETERA, DOES CAUSE VULNERABLE YOUNG MEN, PARTICULARLY, TO BE  MORE VIOLENT.
Stephen: TRUE, AND IN A LOT  OF THESE GAMES THEY'RE NOT JUST  USING GUNS BUT CROWBARS, BASEBALL BATS, AND EVEN  CHAINSAWS. THAT PUTS FRIGHTENING IDEAS IN  KIDS' HEADS. AT THIS POINT, IF I SEE A  TEENAGER COMING AT ME WITH A  CHAINSAW, I'M SORRY, BUT I CROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, VIDEO GAME VIOLENCE  IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM. WHO CAN FORGET, IN THE WAKE OF  SIM CITY, HOW CHILDREN  EVERYWHERE TOOK UP URBAN  PLANNING? [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS ALL "TUNE IN, TURN ON,  AND ZONE FOR RESIDENTIAL USE!"  MAN! [ LAUGHTER ] YES, YES. WHEN TALK STARTS ABOUT  RESTRICTING THINGS, IT'S NEVER  VIDEO GAMES OR MOVIES. IT'S ALWAYS THE MOST INNOCENT  AMONGST US. OUR GUNS. WHY? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE  MEDIA, MILKING TRAGEDY FOR THEIR  OWN PROFIT, INCITING FEAR INSTEAD OF CALMLY AND  OBJECTIVELY REPORTING THE NEWS  LIKE I AM. [ LAUGHTER ] CASE IN POINT, MY GUEST TONIGHT  CNN HOST AND MATTHEW PERRY IN  ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK, PIERS  MORGAN. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO GUN  RIGHTS, LIKE ALL ENGLISHMEN, HE  DRIVES ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE  BARREL. 1010 AMERICANS A YEAR ARE HIT BY  GUNFIRE OR KILLED OR WOUNDED. YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP AND SMELL  THE COFFEE. AT WHAT POINT DO YOU GUNNY LOBBY  GUYS WANT SAY WE GET IT. IT'S TIME TO CHANGE.
Stephen: CALM DOWN, PEERS! WHAT EXPERIENCE DOES THIS UNION  JACK-OFF HAVE WITH GUNS? THEIR POLICE DON'T EVEN CARRY  THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DEBATE  ABOUT WHISTLE CONTROL, I'M ALL  EARS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT PIERS ISN'T INTERESTED IN  HAVING A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION. LOOK AT THE WAY HE IGNORES HIS  GUEST RADIO HOST, GUN ADVOCATE,  AND CONSPIRACY SOMMELIER ALEX JONES' AND HIS PERFECTLY  REASONABLE QUESTIONS.
HOW MANY GUN MURDERS WERE  THERE IN BRITAIN?
HOW MANY GREAT WHITE SHARKS  KILL PEOPLE EVERY YEAR BUT  THEY'RE SCARED TO SWIM?
HOW MANY GUN MURDERS WERE  THERE IN BRITAIN LAST YEAR?
HOW MANY CHIMPANZEES CAN  DANCE ON THE HEAD OF A PIN?
Stephen: YES, ANSWER THE REAL  QUESTIONS, PIERS! [ LAUGHTER ] HOW MANY CHIMPS CAN DANCE ON A  HEAD OF PIN? WHY CAN'T DONKEY'S HANGLIDE? HOW MUCH LUNCHMEAT CAN YOU HIT  WITH A HOCKEY STICK? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S POINTLESS TO TALK ABOUT GUN  CONTROL UNTIL THESE VITAL  QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. NOW, SOME HAVE SAID PIERS PUTS  ONLY CRAZY PEOPLE LIKE ALEX  JONES ON HIS SHOW WHO OPPOSE ALL RESTRICTIONS ON GUN OWNERSHIP,  WHEN HE COULD JUST AS EASILY  HAVE ON REASONABLE PEOPLE LIKE THE NRA, WHO OPPOSE ALL  RESTRICTIONS ON GUN OWNERSHIP. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHO I DARE HIM TO SIT  DOWN WITH? OVERNIGHT INTERNET CELEBRITY AND  CEO OF TACTICAL RESPONSE  FIREARMS TRAINING CENTER JAMES YEAGER, WHO REACTED TO THE  ADMINISTRATION'S UPCOMING GUN  GRAB IN MEASURED TONES.
(bleep) THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M TELLING YOU THAT IF THAT  HAPPENS IT'S GOING TO SPARK A  CIVIL WAR AND I'LL BE GLAD TO FIRE THE FIRST SHOT. I'M NOT (bleep) PUTTING UP WITH  THIS, I AM NOT LETTING MY  COUNTRY BE RULED BY A DICTATOR, I'M NOT LETTING ANYBODY TAKE MY  GUNS. IF IT GOES ONE INCH FURTHER, I'M  GONNA START KILLING PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YES. WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO TAKE  AWAY HIS GUNS? [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOT ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO  SHIMMY DURING THIS DISCUSSION SO  I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY AND I TOOK  IT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, YEAGER TOOK A LITTLE HEAT  FOR HIS PASSION ABOUT THE SECOND  AMENDMENT, SO AFTER A DAY TO COOL DOWN AND REFLECT, HE  EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN A MUCH  CALMER MANNER.
I WAS MAD WHEN I SAID IT AND  PROBABLY ALLOWED MY MOUTH TO  OVERRUN MY LOGIC. BUT I DON'T RETRACT ANY OF MY  STATEMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: OKAY? HE'S SORRY, JUST NOT FOR THE  THINGS THAT HE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T CONDONE ANYBODY DOING  ANYTHING RASH. I DO NOT CONDONE ANYBODY  COMMITTING ANY KIND OF FELONIES,  UP TO AND INCLUDING AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS, OR MURDERS  UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: IMPORTANT POINT! ONLY "NECESSARY" MURDER. OKAY. IF SOMEONE ENDANGERS YOUR  FAMILY, OR, THROUGH THEIR  -- TAKES THEIR YOGURT FROM THE BREAK-ROOM FRIDGE. OR THROUGH THEIR. DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED  REPRESENTATIVES, ENACTS A GUN  CONTROL LAW OF ANY KIND. SO WE NEED TO BE READY. HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?
IT IS TIME TO GET READY. START WORKING OUT, START  STRETCHING. STEERCHG SO IMPORTANT. YOU'VE GOT TO STRETCH. TRUST ME, WHEN THE (bleep) GOES  DOWN, YOU DO NOT WANT TO PULL A  HAMMY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I RECOMMEND -- FEEL THE LIKE I'M  IN A ROAD SHOW OF WHERE THE WILD  THINGS ARE. I RECOMMEND HOT YOGA-- WHEN  YOU'RE MOUNTING AN ARMED  INSURRECTION, YOU WANT YOUR CHAKRAS TO BE OPEN. AND YOUR BUTT HIGH AND TIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU CAN'T BLAME GUYS LIKE  YEAGER FOR BEING PASSIONATE  BECAUSE GUNS ARE THE CIVIL RIGHTS VICTIMS OF OUR TIME. IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT MOST OF  THEM ARE BLACK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT I GET NASTY LOOKS WHEN  I SIT DOWN WITH ONE AT A LUNCH  COUNTER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO  THINKS SO. STANDING WITH ME IS LARRY WARD  FOUNDER OF THE FIRST-EVER GUN  APPRECIATION DAY, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THIS SATURDAY, THE SAME  WEEKEND AS MARTIN LUTHER KING  DAY. AND THAT'S NO COINCIDENCE.
I BELIEVE THAT GUN  APPRECIATION DAY HONORS THE  LEGACY OF DR. KING. I THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD  AGREE WITH ME IF HE WERE ALIVE  TODAY.
Stephen: YES, DR. KING WOULD  BE PRO-GUN JUST AS SURELY AS  JESUS WOULD BE PRO-NAIL. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE LIKE MR. WARD, DR. KING  UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ROOT OF ALL  OPPRESSION IS LACK OF FIREPOWER. [ LAUGHTER ]
IF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAD BEEN  GIVEN THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR  ARMS FROM DAY ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S FOUNDING, PERHAPS  SLAVERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A  CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YES! IF ONLY AMERICA'S FOUNDERS HAD  TURNED TO THE PEOPLE THEY OWNED  AND CHAINED INTO SERVITUDE AND SAID, "HERE'S YOUR GUN. USE IT  RESPONSIBLY." [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS ALL LARRY WARD IS SAYING  IS THAT AMERICA WOULD BE A  BETTER PLACE IF GEORGE WASHINGTON AND THOMAS JEFFERSON  HAD BEEN SHOT BY THEIR SLAVES. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE HE'S A REASONABLE MAN --  OF COURSE, NOT AS REASONABLE AS  THIS DEBATE'S SANEST VOICE THE MOTOR CITY MADMAN, TED TUGENT! WHO, IT TURNS OUT, IS CRAZY FOR  TOLERANCE. TELLING WORLDNET DAILY, "THERE  WILL COME A TIME WHEN THE GUN  OWNERS OF  AMERICA -- WILL BE THE ROSA PARKS AND WE WILL SIT  DOWN ON THE FRONT SEAT OF THE  BUS. CASE CLOSED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CASE CLOSED. IF ROSA PARKS HAD HAD A GUN, SHE  WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SITTING IN  THE BACK OF THAT BUS, SHE COULD HAVE CARJACKED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE NUGE HAS LONG  BEEN AN INSPIRATION FOR THE  CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IN THE WORDS OF THE OLD NEGRO  SPIRITUAL, "FREE AT LAST, FREE  AT LAST, WANGO TANGO! I'M FREE AT LAST."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
