[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  "AMERICAN SAVAGE: INSIGHTS,  SLIGHTS AND FIGHTS ON FAITH, SEX, LOVE AND POLITICS."  IT IS BEING SOLD IN EVERY  SECTION AT BARNES AND NOBLE. PLEASE WELCOME DAN SAVAGE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO SEE YOU, DAN. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ALWAYS LIKE HAVING YOU ON, DAN. FREQUENT FRIEND OF THE SHOW. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALL "AMERICAN  SAVAGE."  OKAY. IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE YOU WERE  ON THE SHOW. STILL GAY?
STILL GAY. tephen: BECAUSE YOU NEVER  KNOW. IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.
DOESN'T WASH OFF IN THE RAIN. Stephen: I KNOW, BUT THE DOOR  IS ALWAYS OPEN.
LIKEWISE. Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I'M STRAPPED IN WHERE I AM. THANK YOU. I'M STAYING ON MY LITTLE...
USUALLY IT'S THE LESBIANS WHO  STRAP IN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELL, SAFETY FIRST. THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. NOW THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING  TO BE HANDING DOWN RULINGS...
TWO RULINGS. Stephen: TWO RULINGS. ONE ON DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT. THE OTHER ONE ON PROP 8 SAYING  NO GAY MARRIAGE IN CALIFORNIA.
RIGHT. SO THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT  WAS PASSED IN THE '90s. BILL CLINTON SIGNED IT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT  RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGES  PERFORMED IN STATES WHERE IT MIGHT BE LEGAL. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THAT  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS  REALLY USURPED THIS POWER FROM THE STATES AND SAID WE WILL PICK  AND CHOOSE BETWEEN MARRIAGES. FIRST COUSINS CAN MARRY IN SOME  STATES NOT IN OTHERS.
Stephen: SOUTH CAROLINA. PEOPLE ARE LEGALLY MARRIED IN  THE STATE WHERE I LIVE,  WASHINGTON STATE. TERRY AND I ARE LEGALLY MARRIED  IN WASHINGTON STRAIGHT. THEIR MARRIAGES ARE RECOGNIZED  BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OURS IS NOT. THAT HAS REAL-WORLD IMLIKS  AROUND INHERITANCE, TAXES AND  SOCIAL SECURITY. CERTAINLY AROUND TAXES. WE HAVE A HUGE TAX BILL BECAUSE  WE CANNOT FILE JOINTLY BECAUSE  WE ARE NOT MARRIED.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NOT.
WE ARE. WE'RE JUST AS MARRIED AS OUR  NEIGHBORS BUT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE OR  MARRIAGE.
Stephen: I'M MARRIED TO A  LADY. THERE'S A NAME FOR IT. IT'S CALLED MARRIAGE. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.
MY MARRIAGE IS JUST AS  MARRIAGE AS YOUR MARRIAGE IS.
Stephen: YOU'RE MARRIED TO A  GUY. DON'T EAR FLAP, OKAY. IT'S LIKE TWO MAGNETS. YOU HAVE TWO POSITIVE ENDS.
YOU TURN ONE OF THOSE MAGNETS  AROUND AND IT FITS RIGHT IN.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE GOING TO  MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT SEX.
YOU'RE MAKING EVERYTHING  ABOUT SEX.
Stephen: I'M SAD. YOU ARE MAKING MARRIAGE ABOUT  SEX WHEN YOU SAY THAT TWO MEN  CANNOT BE MARRIED. THE SERIOUS POINT THOUGH IS THAT  IT IS NOT GAY PEOPLE WHO WISH TO  REDEFINE MARRIAGE. HETEROSEXUALS REDEFINE MARRIAGE. EVERYTHING WE HEAR THAT IS A  DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF  MARRIAGE WHEN GAY PEOPLE WANT TO MARRIAGE, MONNING ON KNEE,  RELIGION, CHILDREN. IT'S AS IF STRAIGHT PEOPLE ARE  SAYING YOU GUYS HAVE TO GET  MARRIED IN 1913. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN 2013.
Stephen: MAYBE IT'S A  COMPLIMENT. MAYBE WE THINK WE CAN HOLE YOU  TO A HIRE STANDARD.
WE ARE BETTER THAN YOU. WE WANT EQUAL RIGHTS NOT DOUBLE  STANDARDS.
Stephen: NOW LISTEN... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. I'VE GOT TO SAY, I DO THINK I  HANDLED THAT WELL. THANK YOU.
WE'RE NOT BETTER THAN YOU. THAT WAS JUST THE HEAT OF THE  MOMENT.
Stephen: WE'LL EDIT OUT YOUR  POLICY. NOW YOU WRITE ABOUT THINGS THAT  ARE NOT GAY RIGHTS IN THIS BOOK. OBAMA CARE, CATHOLICISM,  PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE. WHY DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO TALK  ABOUT THOSE THINGS? YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GAY PEOPLE  AND THOSE THINGS, RIGHT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT OBAMA CARE  GENERALLY. I'M A LIBERAL. I'M A PROGRESSIVE BUT I  DESCRIBE... YOU WOULD DELIGHT IN  THIS. I DESCRIBE OBAMA CARE IN THIS  BOOK AS EVIL.
Stephen: OH, GOD BLESS YOU. IT'S THE LESSER OF TWO EVIL. THE SYSTEM WE HAD BEFORE PRIOR  TO OBAMA CARE IS MORE EVIL, BUT  OBAMA CARE IS STILL A LITTLE  EVIL. IT IS A CONSERVATIVE PLOT, PLAN  HATCHED BY THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION ORIGINALLY ADOPTED BY MITT ROMNEY IN MASSACHUSETTS. BECAUSE OBAMA ROLLED IT OUT ALL  LIBERALS BECAME EMOTIONALLY  INVESTED IN THIS CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR HEALTH CARE WHICH WAS  TO EXTEND PRIVATE HEALTH  INSURANCE AND SUBSIDIZE IT AS OPPOSED TO SWITCHING TO A SINGLE  PAYOR MODEL LIKE EVERY OTHER  INDUSTRIALIZED NATION. YOU KNOW WHO HAS THIS SINGLE  PAYOR MODEL? VATICAN CITY.
Stephen: THIS IS IT RIGHT  THERE.
IT COVERS EVERYTHING BUT  BIRTH CONTROL BECAUSE ALTAR BOYS  CAN'T GET PREGNANT. WHEN ALTAR BOYS START GETTING  PREGNANT THEY'LL COVER BIRTH  CONTROL TOO.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO GLOSS  OVER THAT FOR JUST A MOMENT.
AS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS  DONE FOR DECADES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: DAN, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. DAN SAVAGE. THE BOOK IS "AMERICAN SAVAGE."  GO GET IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
