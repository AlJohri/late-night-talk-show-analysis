Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER CONGRESSMAN WHO NOW LEADS AN ANTI-MARIJUANA LOBBYING GROUP. BET THEY GET A LOT MORE DONE THAN THE PRO MARIJUANA GROUP. PLEASE WELCOME PATRICK KENNEDY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MR. KENNEDY, THANKS FOR COMING ON.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE CV OUT. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY KNOWS THE FAMILY NAME BUT YOU SERVED 16 YEARS IN THE HOUSE IN RHODE ISLAND'S FIRST DISTRICT. YOU WERE CO-AUTHOR AND LEAD SPONSOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUALITY ACT. NOW LEADING PROJECT SAM WHAT IS SAM.
I CAME TO THIS BECAUSE I WAS A SPONSOR OF THIS MENTAL HEALTH BILL THAT SAID THE BRAIN WAS PART OF THE BODY. THAT WAS A BIG PIECE OF LEGISLATION YOU JUST CITED THAT I SPONSORED.
Stephen: IF THE BRAIN IS PART OF THE BODY THEN WHY DO WOMEN WANT TO KNOW IF WE WANT THEM FOR THEIR BODY OR THEIR BRAIN? (LAUGHTER) CAN'T HAVE BOTH, CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. ANYWAY-- GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.
SO JUST LIKE WOMEN ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE A BABY THEY ARE HIGHER COSTS, YOU KNOW, WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU COULDN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE BRAIN AND MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH INSURANCE COMPANIES TRADITIONALLY DO. THEY IMPOSE HIGHER COSTS ON YOU AS A CONSUMER IF YOU HAVE A BRAIN ILLNESS. BUT IF YOU HAVE DIABETES OR ASTHMA OR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, THEY DON'T CHARGE YOU MORE OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU MORE. EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT BE A VERY COSTLY HEALTH PATIENT.
Stephen: BUT IF YOUR BRAIN ILLNESS IS BAD ENOUGH, YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. (LAUGHTER) DOESN'T IT ALL COME OUT IN THE WASH, THERE, PAT?
THAT'S TRUE. YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT IS WHY IT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO GET THE BILL PASSED BECAUSE UNLIKE CANCER ADVOCATES, THEY ALL SHOW UP WHEN YOU HAVE A CANCER BILL. MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES DON'T LIKE TO PUT THEIR HAND UP AND SAY THEY HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE OF THE  STIGMA AGAINST THE ILLNESS.
Stephen: NOW YOU HAVE A NEW AXE TO GRIND HERE. YOU'RE OPPOSED TO MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION. OKAY. YOU'RE A YOUNG, POPULAR DEMOCRAT. WHY ARE YOU ADMIRAL BUZZ SHACKLER ON THIS ONE. I'M WITH YOU, AN I TELL YOU WHY IN A SECOND. I AGREE WITH YOU AND I ALSO DISAGREE WITH YOU FOR TWO DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT FIRST, MAKE YOUR CASE TO AMERICA RIGHT NOW, WHY SHOULD WE NOT LEGALIZE POT. BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENED IN COLORADO IS DOING IT, WASHINGTON STATE IS DOING IT, 20 STATES HAVE LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA.
WELL, I AM A GOOD LIBERAL DEMOCRAT. AND I DON'T LIKE BIG BUSINESS. AND SO THIS IS THE BIG BUSINESS OF ADDICTION. BECAUSE MARIJUANA IS NOW MOVED FROM THE HEMP SHIRTS TO THE BRIEFCASES. THEY'RE TRYING TO SELL THIS NEW BIG BUSINESS JUST LIKE BIG TOBACCO AND BIG LIQUOR ON THE NOTION THAT THEY CAN MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARE ADDICTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEIR MONEY IS. THEIR MONEY IS IN PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LIKE TO USE MORE THAN IS REALLY ACCEPTABLE.
Stephen: OKAY, THAT IS THE ONE-- THAT IS THE ONE, THAT IS THE ONE PART OF THIS THAT I DO LIKE. BECAUSE AS AN INVESTOR, I JUST FOUND OUT THERE IS THIS WHOLE ENORMOUS MARKET CALLED POT THAT HAS BEEN MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF BOOK FOR YEARS. NOW I CAN PUT MY MONEY IN COLORADO COMPANIES THAT ARE GETTING THE STANKIEST BUD POSSIBLE, OKAY, AND I CAN MAKE A BUTT LOAD OF CASH, WHY SHOULDN'T I DO THAT.
THAT IS THE BIG THING ABOUT THIS NEW INDUSTRY. THEY'RE GOING TO ADVERTISE. SO YOU GET FREE JOINTS WHEN YOU GET YOUR LIFT TICKET YOU GET FREE JOINTS WHEN YOU GO-- .
Stephen: IS THAT HAPPENING.
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY.
Stephen: THE PARTY IS HAPPENING.
AND YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GET THE BROWNIES AND COOKIES ALL THC. YOU CAN GET SODAS WITH THC. BUT MOST PEOPLE THINK LEGALIZATION IS ALLOWING ME TO SMOKE MARIJUANA ON THE WEEKENDS. IT'S TO YOU BEING ABLE TO SELL PRODUCTS WITH THC IN IT.
Stephen: NOW I WANT IT TO BE ILLEGAL AGAIN. HERE IS THE THING. IF YOU GET ARRESTED YOU GO TO JAIL, OKAY. YOU ARE FOR DECRIMINALIZATION.
I'M FOR KEEPING IT ILLEGAL BUT FOR ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING. I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD PAY FINES. I THINK THEY SHOULD GET TREATMENT IF THEY NEED IT. AND THAT IS WHY I PASSED THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND MENTAL ADDICTION ACT. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A CHECKUP FROM THE NECK UP.
Stephen: SO INSTEAD OF GOING TO JAIL, YOU GO TO REHAB.
SO, WELL, REHABS ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS.
Stephen: I SHOULD INVEST IN REHABS.
YOU SHOULD INVEST IN REHAB BECAUSE THE BIGGEST NEW ADMISSION NOW, AND IT SURPASSES COCAINE AND ALCOHOL AND METH IS MARIJUANA, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
Stephen: REALLY.
INVEST IN THAT AND INVEST IN MARIJUANA, YOU WILL MAKE OUT IN BOTH RESPECTS, YES.
Stephen: DO YOU SMOKE POT, YOU DON'T DO SUBSTANCE ABUSE ANY MORE. DID YOU SMOKE POT.
IF THE KIND OF MARIJUANA THAT IS AVAILABLE TODAY WAS AVAILABLE BACK WHEN I WAS TRYING IT, I COULD HAVE EATEN IT BECAUSE IT'S THESE EDIBLES THAT-- BECAUSE I HAD ASTHMA, I MOVED ON TO OTHER THINGS TO GET HIGH. I DIDN'T SMOKE-- .
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND. SO IF POT IS ILLEGAL THEN MAYBE WOULD YOU HAVE STOPPED WITH POT.
I MIGHT HAVE STOPPED WITH POT BUT THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE FINALLY REALIZED THAT I HAD A PROBLEM BECAUSE MARIJUANA WOULD HAVE KEPT ME ON THE SLOW TRAIN TO NOWHERE A LOT LONGER THAN COCAINE OR ALCOHOL. WHERE IT'S PRETTY HARD AFTER A WHILE TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE AN ADDICTION. BUT MARIJUANA, YOU CAN SMOKE IT FOR A LONG TIME AND STILL BE IN DENIAL,. YOU KNOW, MY DENIAL WAS TOUGH TO BREAK. I WAS ARRESTED FOR SEVERAL TIMES. I WAS HUMILIATED BUT WITH MARIJUANA I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT A LOT LONGER THAT I DID.
Stephen: I TOLD YOU THERE WERE TWO THINGS THAT WORRY ME. THE OTHER IS THAT IF WE MAKE MARIJUANA LEGAL  IT MIGHT CUT INTO XANAX SALES  BECAUSE PHARMACEUTICALS THOSE THINGS HAVE GOT A SWEET LITTLE EDGE TO THEM. SHOULD WE MAKE PHARMACEUTICALS ILLEGAL AS WELL? BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.
WELL, IT'S LIKE OXYCONTIN WHICH I WAS ADDICTED TO.
Stephen: WAS IT LOVELY.
YEAH, IT FELT REALLY GOOD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S NOW PERMISSIVE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH MAKING MARIJUANA LEGAL IS IT A PERMISSIVE I'M, SAYING OH, IT'S MEDICINE, I WILL TAKE T I WILL FEEL BETTER. AND I REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. AND WITH THE ANXIETY LEVEL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, THE STRESS OF OUR KIDS, WE'RE JUST ADDING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY IN THE SHORT RUN MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER BUT IN THE LONG RUN IS GOING TO REALLY COST THEM AND COST OUR COUNTRY.
Stephen: PATRICK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: PATRICK KENNEDY. PROJECT SAM, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
