(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! GOOD TO HAVE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. FOLKS, FOLKS, LET ME SAY COLBERT NATION, ON THIS NIGHT, I FOUND THE SHOFAR TO HERALD THE ARRIVAL OF ROSH HASHANAH, THE JEWISH NEW YEAR, MAY 5775 BE A YEAR OF HAPPINESS. (LAUGHTER) I STILL GOT IT. (LAUGHTER) NINE YEARS LATER IT STILL TASTES JUST AS RAMMY AS EVER. NICE THING ABOUT A DEAD RAM HORN, IT ONLY-- IT ONLY GETS DEAD RAMMIER. AND FOLKS, I'M ALREADY ENJOYING THE TRADITIONAL ROSH HASHANAH TREAT KNOWN AMONG THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY, APPLES AND CHHONEY. IT EXPRESSES OUR HOPE FOR A SWEET NEW YEAR. AND ROSH HASHANAH IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE JEWISH HIGH HOLIDAY FUN. FROM NOW UNTIL YOM KIPPUR MARKS THE TIME OF SOLEMN REFLECTION AND ATONEMENT KNOWN AS THE DAYS OF REPENTANCE, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE UPCOMING BLOCKBUSTER, TRANSFORMERS 5: DAYS OF REPENTANCE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE PLOT CENTERS ON OPTIMUS PRIME'S BAR MITZVAH AND HIS MOST DIFFICULT TRANSFORMATION YET FROM BOY INTO A MAN AND AT THE END HE TURNS INTO A PEN AND PENCIL SET. TRADITIONALLY THIS IS A TIME TO APOLOGIZE TO ALL THOSE YOU HAVE WRONGED. NOW I DO NOT FOLLOW THIS TRADITION BECAUSE I AM NOT JEWISH AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN WRONG. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BUT FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE GIVEN ANY OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRONGED ME A CHANCE TO SEEK MY FORGIVENESS BY CALLING THE ATONE-PHONE. (APPLAUSE) THE ATONE-PHONE AT 1-888-667-7539 THAT IS 1-888-OOPS-JEW. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, OF COURSE, FOLKS, MAINTAINING ONE TRIPLE 8 OOPS-JEW DOES NOT COME CHEAP THAT IS ONE MORE THING FOR TO YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT. THAT IS WHY EVERY YEAR WE DEFRAY SOME OF THE COSTS BY SHARING OUR LINE WITH OTHER BUSINESSES THAT HAPPEN TO HAVE NAMES THAT CAN BE SPELLED USING THE NAME TELEPHONE NUMBER. FOR INSTANCE, THIS YEAR, WHEN YOU CALL PLEASE PRESS 2 IF YOU WANT THE ATONE-PHONE. IF YOU PRESS 1, YOU WILL BE CONNECTED TO 1-888-MORS-KIDS A CLUB FOR YOUNG TELEGRAPH ENTHUSIASTS IF YOU PRESS 3, YOU REACH 1-888-MOR-PKX, A LEGAL HOTLINE DEDICATED TO THE EVER INCREASING LIST OF EX-WIVES OF MY DEAR FRIEND PK WINSOME. JIM?
ABSOLUTELY. YOU'VE REACH, 1-888-MOR-PKX WHERE WE SAY IT'S NOT ABOUT THE KIDS, IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY. IF THIS IS BRENDA, PRESS 1. IF THIS IS VANESSA PRESS 2. IF THIS IS OTHER BRENDA, PRESS 3. IF THIS IS JANINE, SHH, I HAVEN'T TOLD THE OTHERS ABOUT YOU YET.
Stephen: FINALLY, FOLKS, IF YOU PRESS 4, WILL YOU GET ONPR LDY, A SEX CHAT LINE FEATURING FRESH AIR'S TERRY GROSS. JIMMY? (APPLAUSE) JIMMY, GIVE THEM A TASTE.
HELLO, YOU'RE ON WITH ONPR LADY. THIS IS TERRY.
OH WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
WHAT AM I WEARING?
A SEEMINGLY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION. YET PERHAPS NO OUTWARD SIGNIFIER OF IDENTITY IS MORE POWERFUL THAN WHAT ONE WEARS. THOUGH IT IS CONSIDERED A VIRTUE TO SAY THAT APPEARANCES DON'T MATTER, OFTEN I PROFESSED INDIFFERENCE SAY KIND OF COSTUME BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, JEANS AND A CARDIGAN, BIG BOY.
OH, YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I THINK I NEED A LITTLE FRESH AIR. SO FOLKS, REMEMBER IT'S 1-888-OOPS-JEW, PRESS 2 TO GET THE ATONE-PHONE. OPERATOR IS STANDING BY. 11, 27, 49, FAR TOO OFTEN THESE ARE THE WINNING NUMBERS OF OUR LOTTERY TICKETS. BUT NOW INSIDERS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE SAYING EVEN NUMBERS MAY BE MAKING A COMEBACK. (LAUGHTER) THE ATONE-PHONE. WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST CALLER. SHALOM, HOW HAVE YOU WRONGED ME?
HI, STEPHEN, IT'S INDIE FOLK ROCK LEGEND JEFF TWEEDY.
Stephen: INDIE FOLK ROCK LEGEND JEFF TWEEDY, JEFF THIS IS SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE JEWISH.
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT, STEPHEN, I CONVERTED LAST YEAR.
Stephen: OH, OKAY, AND YOU ARE WRACKED WITH GUILT BECAUSE YOU BETRAYED BOTH JESUS AND ME?
NO, I FEEL BAD BECAUSE I HAD A BAR MITZVAH AND I DIDN'T INVITE YOU.
Stephen: OH-- THAT'S OKAY, JEFF. I JUST HOPE YOU AND YOUR REAL FRIENDS HAD FUN. I WAS PROBABLY BUSY THAT NIGHT ANYWAY.
I'M SO SORRY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MAZEL TOV ON YOUR BAR MITVAH AND DOUBLE STUFF MAZEL ON BEING FORGIVEN BY ME.
THANKS, STEPHEN. WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US SOME FRIDAY FOR SHABBAT DINNER.
Stephen: OH SURE, HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEK?
NEXT WEEK IS YOM KIPPUR, WE'RE FASTING.
Stephen: OH, GREAT, YOU CAN WATCH ME EAT. BYE. (APPLAUSE) FOLKS, AS A PATRIOT I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT DURING A TIME OF WAR WE MUST ALL PUT ASIDE OUR POLITICAL DIFFERENCES, COME TOGETHER AND RALLY AROUND OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF. BUT SOMETIMES A PRESIDENT ACTS SO RECKLESSLY THAT MEN OF GOOD CONSCIENCE CANNOT BUT STAND AND SAY "NO MORE!" JIM?
OUTRAGE THIS MORNING OVER PRESIDENT'S SALUTE WITH A COFFEE CUP IN HIS HAND, SOME SAYING IT IS A LATTE SALUTE. WHEN HE ARRIVED YESTERDAY ON AIR FORCE ONE IN LOWER MANHATTAN WATCH THE INSTAGRAM IMAGES FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. YUP, THAT'S THE PRESIDENT. SALUTING WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A STYROFOAM CUP EITHER WITH COFFEE OR TEA OR WHATEVER IT IS, NONETHELESS, HE DIDN'T SWITCH HANDS. AND PEOPLE ARE FIRED UP ABOUT THIS.
Stephen: OH, I AM MORE THAN FIRED UP ABOUT THIS. (APPLAUSE) WARNING, WARNING, CONTENTS ARE HOT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND BEFORE THE UGLY ACCUSATIONS START FLYING FROM THE LIBERALS THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THE COFFEE WAS BLACK. I AM SICK-- I AM SICK AND TIRED--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THE RACE HUSTLERS OUT THERE PLAYING THE STARBUCKS GIFT CARD. BECAUSE OBAMA WASN'T EVEN DRINKING COFFEE.
THE IDEA THAT I'M GOING TO JUST SORT OF JAUNT OUT THERE WITH MY CHAI TEA AND GIVE THEM THE OLD, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A LATTE SALUTE, IT IS A CHAI SALUTE BECAUSE HE DRINKS CHAI TEA.
Stephen: THANK YOU, CARL, THANK YOU FOR THAT. CHAI TEA. (APPLAUSE) I BET THAT TEA HAD A SPRIG OF ARUGALA IN THERE AND WAS CERTIFIED HALAL BY AN UNDOCUMENTED GAY MUSLIM BARISTA. AND TO ANYONE WHO SAY  OBAMA'S COFFEE SALUTE WAS AN AWKWARD ACCIDENT RATHER THAN THE MANIFESTATION OF A TWISTED MIND HELL-BENT ON DISRESPECTING OUR ARMED FORCES, PREPARE TO BE EDUCATED.
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY I DON'T THINK HE SAID LET ME PUT THE COFFEE IN THIS HAND AND SALUTE A MARINE. I THINK HE WAS BUTTONING HIS JACKET WITH ONE HAND, HE HAD A COFFEE AND HE JUST, OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS TO HAVE IT BACK. I DON'T THINK HE INTENTIONALLY DID THAT, DO YOU?
I THINK WHEN ARE YOU NOT INTENDING TO DO SOMETHING, YOU COULD BE INTENDING TO DO SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW, DOES THAT SOUND IDIOTIC? YES. BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T INTEND IT TO. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS, NOT GRETCHEN HERE WAS OUTRAGED. SO SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO STRIKE BACK WITH THE MOST POWERFUL PUNS IN HER ARSENAL.
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS, PRESIDENT SALUTING WITH A COFFEE CUP IN HIS HAND, WAS IT A LATTE DISRESPECT OR A LATTE DO ABOUT NOTHING. SEND US YOUR HASHTAG E-MAILS NOW.
Stephen: OH, I WILL SEND YOU MY HASHTAG E-MAILS NOW. MISS LOG ON-- HOLD ON-- GIVE ME A SECOND HERE. POWER THAT THING UP. LET ME JUST LOCK ON TO HASHTAG E-MAILS.COM. DEAR STEVE DOOCY, NOT GRETCHEN, AND BROWN HAIRED GUY WHO IS NOT STEVE DOOCY. I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT'S SALUTE WAS A LATTE DISRESPECT, IT WAS UN-AMERICANO, THIS IS A MOCHA-RY OF OUR MILITARY, THAT SHOULD HAVE US FLYING OUR FLAGS AS HALF-CAF. NO SANKA, YOU, SIR, NOT IN MY MAXWELL HOUSE. IT MAKES ME VERY UNFRAPPY TO SEE. WE GOT TO PUT THAT DOPIO ON AN ESPRESSO TRAIN TO CAPPU-CHINA BEFORE IT'S TOO CAFE AU LATE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME VENTI MY ANGER, AND HASHTAG E-MAIL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
