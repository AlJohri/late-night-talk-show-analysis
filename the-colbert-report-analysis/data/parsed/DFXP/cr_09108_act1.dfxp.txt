Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE, WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. YOUR LOVE IS LIKE A VACATION. FOLKS, I'VE GOT A CONFESSION TO  MAKE-- I'M NO FAN OF BARACK  OBAMA. THERE, I SAID IT. SOMEBODY HAD TO. BUT I AM A FAN OF HOW HE'S  HANDLED THE WAR ON TERROR BY  FOLLOWING THE EXACT SAME POLICIES LAID OUT BY PRESIDENT  BUSH. BUSH. ( LAUGHTER )  WHO FOLLOWED THE EXACT SAME  POLICIES LAID OUT BY.  CHENEY,  PARTICULARLY HIS FLYING DEATHBOT PROGRAM WHICH HAVE SOME  CRITICIZED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN  USED TO KILL AMERICANS OVERSEAS. BUT IT'S VERY LIMITED IN ITS  SCOPE IN THAT ONLY AN INFORMED,  HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL CAN ORDER YOUR DEATH. ( LAUGHTER )  SECRETARY OF STATE, DEFINITELYE  NO LOWER THAN THE POSTMASTER  GENERAL. ( LAUGHTER )  WHICH I ASSUME MEANS NO MORE  KILLING ON SATURDAYS. ( LAUGHTER )  AND IT'S ALL PERFECTLY LEGAL  THANKS TO A 2001 CONGRESSIONAL  RESOLUTION CALLED "THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF  MILITARY FORCE" OR A.U.M.F. SO-CALLED, BECAUSE IT IS WHAT  GIVES OBAMA'S UNCHECKED KILLING  AUTHORITY THAT SPECIAL OOMPH. NOW, HERE--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  RIGHT HERE. IS-- THIS IS  HE ACTUAL  RESOLUTION, A SVELTE 60 WORDS OF  ETERNAL WAR-JUSTIFYING  DELICIOUSNESS. HERE WE GO. "BE IT RESOLVED THAT THE  PRESIDENT IS  UTHORIZED TO USE  ALL NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE FORCE AGAINST THOSE NATIONS,  ORGANIZATIONS, OR PERSONS HE  DETERMINES PLANNED, AUTHORIZED, COMMITTED OR AIDED THE TERRORIST  ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED SEPTEMBER  11, 2001 OR HARBORED SUCH ORGANIZATIONS OR PERSONS IN  ORDER TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE ACTS  OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES BY  SUCH NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, OR  PERSONS."  FOLKS, THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY SWEEPING, KNEE-JERK  DECLARATION OF VENGEFUL FURY  SINCE FDR. SAID AFTER PEARL  HARBOR. THIS IS A DATE THAT WILL LIVE IN  INFAMY. HEY, TOGO, I DON'T NEED TO STAND  UP TO PUT MY BOOT UP YOUR ASS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND, FOLKS, THIS UNLIMITED POWER  TO WAGE WAR WHEREVER IS THE  RESULT OF A CAREFUL, DELIBERATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE  AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS,  CONGRESS TOOK AN ENTIRE SEVEN DAYS TO PASS IT. THAT'S LONGER THAN IT TOOK GOD  TO MAKE HEAVEN AND EARTH. ( LAUGHTER )  INCIDENTALLY, HEAVEN AND EARTH--  THOSE ARE THE AREAS WHERE THE  PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZED TO KILL  PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER )  DON'T TRY HIDING BEHIND THAT  GATE, ST. PETER. WE HAVE INTELE THAT PUTS YOU IN  THE MIDDLE EAST 2,000 YEARS AGO. CLEARLY, IT IS A GREAT  RESOLUTION, WHICH IS WHY I WAS  SO DISAPPOINT THE BY A MAJOR POLICY SPEECH THE PRESIDENT GAVE  TODAY AT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE  UNIVERSITY-- GREAT FOOTBALL TEAM, BY THE WAY. THEIR DEFENSIVE LINE IS F-14s. ( LAUGHTER )  AND IN HIS SPEECH, OBAMA  ANNOUNCED HE IS READY TO GIVE UP  ALL THAT POWER.
THE A.U.M.F. IS NOW NEARLY 12  YEARS OLD. THINKING, OUR DEFINITIONS, OUR  ACTIONS, WE MAY CONTINUE TO  GRANT PRESIDENTS UPBOUND POWERS MORE SUITED TOWARDS TRADITIONAL  ARMED CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATION  STATES. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING  CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  IN EFFORTS TO REFINE AND ULTIMATELY REPEAL THE A.U.M.F. MANDATE.
Stephen:  THE PRESIDENT  WANTS TO REPEAL THE SOURCE OF  HIS POWER. THAT'S LIKE RYAN GOSLING  REPEALING HIS ABS. OR MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY REPEAL  HIS ABS. ( LAUGHTER )  OR ME REPEALING MY POWER TO NAME  PEOPLE WITH ABS. LAUGH AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,  SOME IN CONGRESSMENT TO HELP HIM  DO IT.
I'M CONVINCED THAT IF WE DO  NOT REPEAL THIS AUTHORIZATION TO  USE FORCE THAT I VOTED AGAINST IN 2001, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE  STATE OF PERPETUAL WAR FOREVER.
HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY SQUARE  THIS WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT--  OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO  DECLARE WAR?
Stephen:  OH, GREAT! LET'S PUT CONGRESS IN CHARGE OF  THE WAR ON TERROR. HEY, WE HAVE AL QAEDA NUMBER ONE  IN OURSITIS? DO WE HIT HIM WITH A DRONE? THREE MONTHS OF SUBCOMMITTEE  HEARINGS LATER HE'S STILL ON THE  LOOSE BUT ACKNOWLEDGE HAS NAMESLET AYMAN AL ZAWAHIRI POST  OFFICE.
IF ANYTHING I SAY THE  A.U.M.F. IS TOO RESTRICTIVE  BECAUSE THE RESOLUTION SAYS YOU'VE GOT TO LINK THE  TERRORISTS YOU'RE KILLING TO  9/11. SO FAR THAT HAS NOT BEEN A  PROBLEM THANKS TIE HIGH-LEVEL  C.I.A. TECHNIQUE KNOWN AS SIX DEGREES OF GUYS WHO DON'T EAT  BACON. ( LAUGHTER )  FOR INSTANCE, HERE IS HOW WE  JUSTIFIED-- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T  EAT BACON, RIGHT? YOU KNOW THAT? I'M NOT GIVING AWAY STATE  SECRETS THERE. HERE'S HOW WE JUSTIFIED DRONE  STRIKES IN YEMEN. YEMEN. LEMON. LEMON LIME. 7 AND 7. 711  9/11. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  PERFECTLY LEGAL. BUT, FOLKS, THERE MAY COME A DAY  WHEN WE CAN'T LINK SOMEONE TO  9/11. OKAY, ANOTHER DAY. WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU. LAYOFF LAUGH THAT'S WHY I'M WITH  SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR AND AUNT  WHO GIVES YOU THE SAME POLO SHIRT EVERY YEAR, LINDSEY  GRAHAM.
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE  A.U.M.F. ANEW. WE NEED TO BROADEN THE ABILITY  TO GO AFTER THE ENEMY BECAUSE  IT'S CHANGING DAY BY DAY, BUT WE NEED TO DO SO WITHIN THE VALUES  OF BEING AN AMERICAN.
Stephen:  YES, INSTEAD OF  REPEALING THE A.U.M.F., WE MUST  BROAD BROADEN THE PRESIDENT'S WAR POWERS IN A WAY THAT IS  CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES  ENSCHIEPPED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. AS MADISON WROTE IN ARTICLE 3  YIPPEE KI-YAY, ( BLEEP ). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FOLKS, I MEAN, WHY STOP AT  REMOVING SEPTEMBER 11? I MEAN, I THINK-- I'LL AUTHORIZE  ANYTHING THAT MOVES! ALL RIGHT, TAKE OUT SEPTEMBER  11. THAT THING CAN GO. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER  THINGS THAT CAN COME OUT. FOR INSTANCE, NECESSARY. APPROPRIATE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WEARING  WHITE PANTS AFTER LABOR DAY. ( LAUGHTER )  OKAY, THAT CAN GO. AND WE DON'T NEED THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S DONE. THAT'S REDUNDANT. THAT'S OLD. THIS IS GONE. THAT'S OUT. THAT'S OUT. THAT'S OUT. THAT'S OUT. THAT'S OUT. OKAY. THIS IS ALL YOU NEED. THE PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZED TO  USE ALL FORCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YOU KNOW, A LITTLE LESS-- A  LITTLE LESS YAKKETY-YAK. A MORE ATTACKETY-TACK. THIS IS SHORT ENOUGH TO TWEET. #KABOOM. BUT YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THESE DAYS  IT SEEMS LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE  WHO WANTS TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE. HERE TO TELL ME HE WANTS TO KEEP  AMERICA SAFE IS RETIRED ARMY  COLONEL AND PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AT  BOSTON UNIVERSITY, ANDREW  BACEVICH. COLONEL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  BEING ON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. NOW, WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKED  ABOUT GETTING RID OF THE  A.U.M.F. TODAY IN HIS SPEECH, IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE HE WAS SAYING  THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THE  WAR ON TERROR WILL END.
WE WOULD HOPE SO.
Stephen:  NO, BUT-- NO! ( LAUGHTER )  THERE WILL ALWAYS ABE TIME WHEN  I COULD BE TERRIFIED AND-- AND  IN SUCH CASE, WE SHOULD BE AT WAR WITH THAT. ( LAUGHTER )
WE MAY DIFFER ON THE  FUNDAMENTAL POINT.
Stephen:  WE MIGHT. YOU MIGHT BE WRONG.
I THINK WAR IS BAD. YOU THINK WAR IS...?
Stephen:  SOMETIMES  NECESSARY, SIR, SOMETIMES  NECESSARY.
AGREED AND ONLY WHEN  NECESSARY SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO GO  TO WAR. AND WHEN WE CHOOSE TO GO TO WAR,  WE REALLY OUGHT TO ADHERE TO THE  PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION. MEANING CONGRESS DECIDES AND  AUTHORIZES THE PRESIDENT TO WAGE  WAR.
Stephenn  BUT THEY DID. THEY DID. THEY AUTHORIZED HIM. THEY PASSED THIS THING THAT SAID  GO GET HIM! , IS IC HIM!
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEN A CRISIS OCCURS THE  CONGRESS SAID-- THE CONGRESS  THROWS THE PRESIDENT THE KEYS TO THE CAR AND SAYS DRIVE WHEREVER  YOU WANT TO. SEND US THE BILL.
Stephen:  RIGHT. RUN OVER OUR ENEMIES.
WELL, PRESIDENT BUSH RAN OVER  THE CLIFF. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE  SOMEWHAT BETTER, AND BASED ON  HIS SPEECH TODAY, SEEMS TO HAVE COME TO A REALIZATION THAT, HE  WANTS TO SAY TO THE CONGRESS,  "HERE, MAYBE SHUTAKE THE KEYS BACK."  IS THERE WHY WOULD REQUEST  PRESIDENT WANT TO SURRENDER  POWER? THAT'S LIKE SUPERMAN SAYING I'LL  TAKE A KRYPTONITE ENEMA, PLEASE?
IF YOU READ THE TEXT OF THE  NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY  SPEECH, THE PRESIDENT IN EFFECT IS ADMITTING HIS RELIANCE ON  DRONES, THIS PROGRAM OF TARGETED  ASSASSINATION, MAY HAVE SOME UPSIDES BUT IT HAS SIGNIFICANT  DOWNSIDES. HE'S NOW ACKNOWLEDGE AGO.
Stephen:  WHAT DOWNSIDE?
THE DOWNSIDE IS IT ALIEN AETS  A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE  WORLD'S POPULATION. OH, NO! ARE YOU SAYING THE ARABS MAY NOT  LIKE US?
THE ARABS, MANY OF THEM,  DON'T LIKE US.
Stephen:  THAT'S WHY WE  NEED THIS. WE CAN'T BE THE GOOD GUYS. GOOD GUY COUNTRIES FINISH LAST.
IF WAR IS GOOD, EUROPE RIGHT. IF WAR IS BAD, I'M RIGHT.
Stephen:  I'M NOT SAYING  WAR IS GOOD. I'M SAYING VIGILANCE IS  NECESSARY. THAT SOUND GOOD. I LIKE THAT. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME CONGRESS  DECLARED WAR.
WORLD WAR II.
Stephen:  REALLY? AGAINST THE JAPANESE AND THE  NAZIS, THAT'S LAST TIME?
THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen:  WHAT HAVE WE DONE  SINCE THEN?
WORKAROUNDLEADING TO THE  COMMANDER IN CHIEF CLAIMING EVER  MORE AUTHORITY TO DO WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS TO DO.
Stephen:  AND IT SEEMS TO  HAVE WORK OUTSIDE ON THE OKAY.
WE MAY DIFFER.
Stephen:  WE MAY DIFFER ON  THAT ONE.
WE MAY DIFFER WITH REGARD TO  THE NECESSITY AND OUTCOME OF THE  IRAQ WAR WHICH I WOULD JUDGE TO HAVE BEEN TOTAL TOTALLY  UNNECESSARY AND COMPLETELY  DISASTROUS.
Stephen:  SO YOU'D RATHER  SEE SADDAM BACK IN POWER. THOSE ARE YOUR WORD. YOU JUST SAID THAT. ALL RIGHT?
YOU WIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  YOU'RE MY FAVORITE KIND OF GUEST. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANDREW BACEVICH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
