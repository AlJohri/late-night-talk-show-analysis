[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,  BUT I'VE BEEN DISMAYED BY THE  NUMBER OF STATES CHILLAXING THEIR MARIJUANA LAWS. JUST THIS PAST NOVEMBER, BALLOT  INITIATIVES LEGALIZING  RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA PASSED IN COLORADO AND WASHINGTON WITH  BROAD SUPPORT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH, YEAH, DON'T WORRY WE'LL  STOP THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] THANKFULLY, ONE STATE IS TRYING  TO WEED OUT THE PROBLEM. [LAUGHTER] JIM?
A FLORIDA BILL THAT WOULD  OUTLAW THE SALE OF BONGS IS  PASSING A HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE. UNDER THAT BILL, ANY RETAILER  THAT SELLS THE PIPES USED FOR  SMOKING MARIJUANA WOULD BE  CHARGED.
Stephen: SORRY, SUNSHINE  STATE STONERS. IF YOU WANT TO GET HIGH IN  FLORIDA, YOU'LL HAVE TO GET A  PRESCRIPTION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. [LAUGHTER] UNDER HOUSE BILL 49, IT WILL BE  A FIRST-DEGREE MISDEMEANOR TO  SELL METAL, WOODEN, ACRYLIC, GLASS, STONE, PLASTIC, OR  CERAMIC SMOKING PIPES. [LAUGHTER] WITH OR WITHOUT SCREENS,  PERMANENT SCREENS, OR PUNCTURED  METAL BOWLS, WATER PIPES, CARBURETION TUBES AND DEVICES. -- CHAMBER PIPES, CARBURETOR  PIPES, ELECTRIC PIPES,  AIR-DRIVEN PIPES, CHILLUMS, BONGS, ICE PIPES OR CHILLERS. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE  LIST OF MELLOWS THAT HAVE BEEN  HARSHED. [LAUGHTER] BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED. THIS BILL DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO  COVER THE THINGS STONERS CAN USE  AS PARAPHERNALIA: APPLES, SODA CANS, WATER  BOTTLES, HONEY BEARS, ALUMINUM  FOIL, TRAFFIC CONES, EMPTY ICE CREAM PINTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STONERS ARE LIKE MACGUYVER. THEY CAN TURN ANY HOUSEHOLD  ITEM INTO A BONG -- AND THEN  SPEND THE AFTERNOON WATCHING "MACGUYVER." [LAUGHTER] I'M TELLING YOU. LISTEN TO ME, FOLKS --  DON'T PUT ANYTHING PAST THESE  DOOBIE DO-IT-YOURSELFERS. EQUIPPED WITH A STINKY NUG AND  NO PIPE, THERE IS NOTHING THEY  CANNOT SHALL EXCUSE ME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING DONE THERE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SORRY MAN, IS THIS YOUR SHOE?
Stephen: YES. YES, IT'S MY SHOE.
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE USING  IT.
Stephen: I AM.
SORRY MAN.
