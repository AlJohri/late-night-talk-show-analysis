[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, WELCOME BACK, AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, AMERICA HAS MADE GREAT  STRIDES WHEN IT COMES TO RACE  RELATIONS. JUST TODAY I WATCHED ALMOST AN  ENTIRE TYLER PERRY MOVIE BEFORE  I REALIZED IT WAS ONE OF THOSE MICHAEL JORDAN HANES  COMMERCIALS. [ LAUGHTER ] STILL, WE'RE CLOSER TO THAT  MOUNTAINTOP. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SOME PEOPLE JUST WON'T LET  RACISM GO. LIKE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE  COLIN POWELL.
I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  RIGHT NOW IS HAVING AN IDENTITY  PROBLEM. THERE'S ALSO A DARK-- A DARK  VEIN OF INTOLERANCE IN SOME  PARTS OF THE PARTY. WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT? I MEAN BY THAT IS THEY STILL  SORT OF LOOK DOWN ON MINORITIES.
Stephen: HOW DARE COLIN  POWELL CHARGE THE GOP WITH  INTOLERANCE, WHEN IT IS THE PARTY OF SUCH PROMINENT BLACK  REPUBLICANS AS COLIN POWELL  AND-- OTHERS, ONE IMAGINES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT  WE'RE IN A POST-RACIAL AMERICA  IS THAT THE KU KLUX KLAN, MAYBE THE GROUP MOST IDENTIFIED WITH  RACISM-- AREN'T RACISTS ANYMORE! JIM?
THE KU KLUX KLAN IS OUT TO  CHANGE ITS IMAGE AND PROMOTE A  NEW AGENDA.
THE KLAN SAYS IT'S NOW UNDER  CHRISTIAN BASED LEADERSHIP,  STRESSING THAT IT'S NOT A HATE GROUP ANYMORE, BUT A GROUP THAT  WANTS TO CALL ATTENTION TO  ISSUES LIKE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND OUTSOURCING OF JOBS.
EVERYONE THINKS THAT WE'RE A  HATE GROUP. WE'RE NOT A HATE GROUP. WE DON'T HATE ANYONE. I MEAN, WE WANT TO SEE GOOD  THINGS COME TO OUR RACE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: SEE? THEY ARE NOT A HATE GROUP. THEY JUST WANT TO SEE GOOD  THINGS COME TO THEIR RACE--  THROUGH EYEHOLES CUT IN A  PILLOWCASE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS NEW KKK IS SPREADING  ITS POSITIVE MESSAGE THE WAY ANY  OPEN-MINDED GROUP WOULD: DOOR-TO-DOOR IN THE DEAD OF  NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
PEOPLE IN NEWTON COUNTY WERE  SHOCKED TO FIND FLYERS IN THEIR  DRIVEWAY THIS WEEK URGING THEM TO JOIN THE KU KLUX KLAN. KLAN MEMBERS DISTRIBUTED FLYERS  IN NEIGHBORHOODS ALL THE WAY  FROM FLORIDA TO NEW YORK STATE.
FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TWO  MONTHS, PEOPLE LIVING IN ONE  PART OF CENTRAL VIRGINIA HAVE WOKEN UP TO FIND LETTERS FROM  THE KU KLUX KLAN IN THEIR  DRIVEWAY. THOSE FLYERS HAVE MANY IN THIS  MECHANICSVILLE NEIGHBORHOOD  FEELING UNEASY. SOME, VIOLATED.
Stephen: NOW, I CAN  UNDERSTAND WHY FLYERS MIGHT  UPSET PEOPLE. BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE,  IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT THEY USED  TO LEAVE ON PEOPLE'S LAWNS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AGAIN, THIS AGGRESSIVE  RECRUITMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH RACISM. THE FACT THAT IT'S HAPPENING  UNDER A BLACK PRESIDENT IS  SIMPLY A COINCIDENCE. IT COULD JUST AS EASILY HAVE  BEEN A JEWISH PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SADLY, THERE'S A DARK CLOUD  HANGING OVER THOSE WHITE HOODS. BECAUSE  ACCORDING TO THE  SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER, IN  THE LAST TWO YEARS "THE NUMBER OF KKK CHAPTERS DROPPED FROM 221  TO 152."  AND THIS COMES AT A TIME WHEN  HATE GROUPS OVERALL ARE ENJOYING TREMENDOUS GROWTH. [ LAUGHTER ] AIN'T THAT A KICK IN THE ROBE? [ LAUGHTER ] SO WHY IS THE KKK's BRAND  SUFFERING? WELL, APPARENTLY, EVEN THOUGH  THEY'RE TOTALLY NOT RACIST  ANYMORE, THOSE SHEETS BEAR SOME KIND OF A STAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] ACCORDING TO THE SPLC's MARK  POTOK, "THE KLAN IS HAVING  TROUBLE WITH RECRUITMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE STIGMATIZED THAN  OTHER HATE GROUPS, SUCH AS THE  NEO-NAZIS." [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. THOSE KLAN ROBES HAVE A STIGMA,  UNLIKE NAZI UNIFORMS, THOSE HAD  STYLE. [ LAUGHTER ] POINT IS, SAYING YOU'RE NOT A  HATE GROUP JUST ISN'T ENOUGH. NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO WIN ANY  AWARDS FOR THIS-- AT LEAST NOT  ANY I WOULD DISPLAY-- BUT I'VE GOT A COUPLE HELPFUL HINTS TO  HELP THE NON-RACIST KKK. FIRST OF ALL, I KNOW THAT  FLOWING ROBES ARE TRADITION, BUT  IF YOU WANT TO REACH OUT TO TODAY'S YOUNG, HIPSTER WHITE  SUPREMACISTS, YOU'D DO BETTER  WITH SKINNY JEANS AND IRONIC  T-SHIRTS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I KNOW THE HOODS ARE PART OF  THE HERITAGE, BUT IT MAKES IT  LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ASHAMED. WHY NOT WEAR YOUR KLAN  AFFILIATION PROUDLY AND  TRANSPARENTLY BY PUTTING ON A  CLEAR HOOD? [ LAUGHTER ] JUST SLIP A DRY-CLEANING BAG  OVER YOUR HEAD, AND KEEP IT IN  PLACE WITH A RUBBER BAND AROUND YOUR NECK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, THAT'S A GREAT NEW LOOK--  THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING  TO LOVE TO
