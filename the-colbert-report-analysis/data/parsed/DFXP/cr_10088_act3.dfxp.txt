Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A RENOWNED SCIENTIST WHO DISCOVERED THAT CHIMPS USE TOOLS. PLEASE WELCOME DAME JANE GOODALL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DR. GOODALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. I'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN FASCINATED WITH YOUR WORK SINCE I WAS JUST A BOY. EVERYONE KNOWS YOU AS THE CHIMPANZEE EXPERT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IF I WERE A CHIMP THAT YOU WERE MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME, WOULD THERE BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR BODY LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW IF YOU WERE MEETING ME FOR THE FIRST TIME? IF YOU WERE TREATING ME LIKE A CHIMP, WHAT WOULD IT BE?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WHAT WOULD BE IT BE?
DO YOU WANT TO DEMONSTRATE? YES, I DO. RIGHT HERE? DO I STAND OR --
YOU STAND. YOU DO AS I WELL YOU. OKAY? (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE THE BIG MALE SO YOU'RE DOMINANT. YEP, LIKE THAT. AND I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS OF YOU. NOW, YOU MUSTN'T MAKE A SOUND, RIGHT? NO SOUND FROM YOU. NO, NOTHING. I MAKE THE SOUND. SO I JUST GO -- UH, UH, UH, UH, UH -- BUT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE ME, SO YOU GO UH, UH, UH, UH, UH -- (APPLAUSE)
ARE WE GOING STEADY NOW? WE'RE GOING STEADY. ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU WORK IN TANZANIA AND YOU WORK WITH FLO, GIGI, FRODO, MIKE AND HUMPHREY. NOW YOUR BOOK IS CALLED SEEDS OF HOPE, THE WISDOM AND WONDER FROM THE WORLD OF PLANTS. WHY GO FROM CHIMPANZEES TO PLANTS? DID YOU GET BORED?
NO.
Stephen: YOU'VE SEEN ONE ON ROLLER SKATES YOU'VE SEEN THEM ALL?
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM OFF OF ROLLER SKATES.
Stephen: IN THIS JOB MARKET, I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT.
I HAD TO LEAVE THE FOREST BECAUSE THE FOREST ACROSS AFRICA ARE DISAPPEARING AS THEY ARE AROUND THE WORLD. CHIMPANZEE NUMBERS ARE DROPPING. SO I HAD TO START TALKING ABOUT THE TERRIBLE THINGS WE'RE DOING TO THE PLANET.
Stephen: WHAT ARE WE DOING TO THE PLANTS? HOW ARE WE HURTING THEM?
EVERY WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE. WE'RE DESTROYING THEM BY CUTTING DOWN THE FORESTS WHICH RELEASES CO2 WHICH ADDS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE TAKING OVER MORE AND MORE ECOSYSTEMS FOR OUR DEVELOPMENTS, OUR BUILDINGS, OUR SUPERMARKETS. WE'RE MINING DEEP IN THE FOREST, WE'RE MAKING ROADS FOR THE HUNTERS TO COME KILL THE ANIMALS.
Stephen: BUT WE PRODUCE A LOT OF CO2 NOW. DON'T THE PLANTS USE THAT FOR FOOD? AREN'T WE HELPING THE PLANTS AS MUCH AS HURTING THEM?
NO. AT ONE TIME WE LIVED IN HARMONY, BUT NOW BALANCE, WE'RE RELEASING FOSSIL FUELS, CUTTING DOWN FORESTS, ADDING TO GREENHOUSE GASES. LOOK AT THE CLIMATE. WE'VE HAD THE WORST WINTER IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA, THE WETTEST WINTER IN ENGLAND. I PASSED FIELDS WHERE SWANS WERE FLOATING.  THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL. IT'S NOT SO BEAUTIFUL IF YOU'RE A FARMER. NOT REALLY.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING THAT WORRIES ME ABOUT YOUR NEW STUDIES IS THE THINGS YOU WERE DOING BEFORE WITH CHIMPANZEES, YOU WERE SEEING THEM AS INDIVIDUALS AND HAVING EMPATHY FOR THEM. AM I GOING TO HAVE EMPATHY FOR PLANTS NOW? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO FEEL GUILTY WHEN I'M, YOU KNOW, CHOWING DOWN ON AN EAR OF CORN THIS SUMMER.
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE CHEWING ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN WHICH MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOU IN THE LONG RUN. SOME OF THESE TREES, WHEN YOU MEET 2,000-YEAR-OLD TREES AND YOU THINK, MY GOODNESS! WHAT HAS IT SEEN? HOW AMAZING! YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE BARK WITH THE SAP GOING OFF OF IT --
Stephen: JANE GOODALL, ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE ME CRY ABOUT TREES? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU LEARNED EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ABOUT CHIMPANZEES, THAT THEY'RE TOOL USERS. IN FACT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LITTLE CLIP THERE.
THE CHIMPANZEE IS MODIFYING AN OBJECT TO SUIT IT TO A SPECIFIC PURPOSE, THUS MAKING A TOOL. LEWIS GOT EXTREMELY EXCITED AND SAID WE HAVE TO REDEFINE MAN, TOOLS OR INCLUDE CHIMPANZEES WITH HUMANS.
Stephen: LOOKS LIKE THAT CHIMP IS LAUGHING AT US.
PROBABLY IS.
Stephen: ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE -- AND WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THAT CLIP, ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVES IN THIS EVOLUTION GAME? (LAUGHTER) ALL YOUR YEARS OF LIVING WITH CHIMPS, DID YOU SEE ONE OF THEM EVOLVE INTO A MAN? FALL OUT OF A TREE, HAIR COMES OFF, PUTS ON A TIE, HE'S A MAN? JUST ONE, AND I'M ON BOARD.
NO.
Stephen: EVER HAPPEN? I'M AFRAID YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO JOIN ME ON THIS BAND WAGON.
Stephen: OH, WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.
THAT'S TOO BAD.
Stephen: BECAUSE WE'RE GOING STEADY.
WELL, YOU JUST BLEW IT. (CHEERING)
Stephen: JANE GOODALL, "SEEDS OF HOPE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
