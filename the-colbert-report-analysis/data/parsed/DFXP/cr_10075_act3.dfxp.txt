Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON TALKING ABOUT THE NEW TELEVISION SHOW COSMOS. ALL RIGHT, WHY DID YOU, NEIL, THE SHOW WAS GREAT, I REALLY ENJOYED IT. AND SO DO MY KIDS, BUT WHY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS SHOW? WE ALREADY HAD ONE, YOU KNOW, 34 YEARS AGO. WHY DO IT AGAIN? HAS SCIENCE REALLY CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH?
NO, THE TIME HAD COME. IT WAS-- SO NOT ONLY HAS SCIENCE SINCE THEN WE DISCOVERED A THOUSAND EXO PLANETS, THE HIGGS BOSON, WE HAVE DISCOVERED THE-- WE HAVE STRONG IDEAS THAT A MULTIVERSE EXISTS. I MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.
Stephen: MULTIVERSE?
A MULTIVERSE. WELL, IT MAY NOT BE JUST ONE UNIVERSE. THERE MAY BE MANY UNIVERSES. BUT THERE WASN'T --
DOESN'T SCIENCE DEPEND ON EXPERIMENTATION. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO --
BRING IN THE OTHER NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON --
IT IS A THEORETICAL FRONTIER AT THIS POINT BUT AN INTRIGUING ONE WITH COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR WHY IT WOULD BE SO.
YOU GET PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE.
WE ALSO DISCOVERED DARK ENERGY. THIS HAS BEEN A SERIOUS PRESSURE IN THE VACUUM OF SPACE PUSHING AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE COLLECTIVE GRAVITY OF ALL THE GALAXIES MAKING EXPANDING UNIVERSE ACCELERATE. ALL IN THE LAST 34 YEARS.
HERE IS WHAT I DON'T LIKE. I SAW YOU ON THE CNN TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT SCIENCE IS.
YEAH.
AND THAT SCIENCE SAYS THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BOTH SIDES OF EVERY DEBATE. YOU KNOW. LIKE WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY THE EARTH IS ROUND AND BRING ON FLAT EARTHERS TOO. DON'T YOU WANT IT TO BE FAIR AND BALANCED.
THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF EVERYONE'S TIME.
WHY.
ONCE SCIENCE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, ONCE A SCIENTIFIC TRUTH EMERGES FROM A CONSENSUS OF EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS, IT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD.
SO SAY YOU. BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE, BUT IS THE SCIENCE IN ON SCIENCE?
WHAT I'M SAYING IS WHEN DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS GIVE YOU THE SAME RESULTS, IT IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO YOUR OPINION. THAT'S THE GOOD THING ABOUT IT. IT'S TRUE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE IN IT, THAT'S WHY IT WORKS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SO IF MY SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT, LET'S JUST SAY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT I BELIEVED THE WORLD WAS FLAT AND YOU BELIEVE THE WORLD IS ROUND. DON'T I DESERVE MORE TIME FOR MY ARGUMENT BECAUSE MINE IS A MUCH HARDER CASE TO MAKE?
YOU GET TO SAY THE WORLD IS FLAT BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT GUARANTEES YOUR FREE SPEECH. BUT IT'S NOT A COUNTRY THAT GUARANTEES THAT ANYTHING YOU SAY IS CORRECT.
I'M JUST SAYING.
Stephen: THAT IS SUCH A LIBRA THING TO SAY. (LAUGHTER) YOU ARE A LIBRA, AREN'T YOU.
I AM LIBRA.
Stephen: OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE SURPRISED CARL SAGAN MOST ABOUT WHAT HAS CHANGED IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSE SINCE HIS DEATH IN THIS.
1996. I THINK WHAT WOULD SURPRISE HIM THE MOST IS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO ARGUE THAT SCIENCE IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN SOCIETY. THAT IS WHAT WOULD SURPRISE HIM THE MOST. (APPLAUSE) FOR STARTERS. SCIENTIFICALLY, I THINK HE WOULD FIND THE IDEA OF THE MULTIVERSE PRETTY COOL.
Stephen: THE IDEA OF THE MULTIVERSE IS COOL BUT SO IS THE IDEA OF THE FORCE. NEIL, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE.
EVERY WEEK.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. THE COSMOS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
