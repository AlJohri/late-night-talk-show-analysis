Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, YOU KNOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I  HAVE JUST GOTTEN A COPY OF THIS  AND I HAVE FOR THE LAST WEEK BEEN GOING THROUGH THE DETAILS  OF CONGRESS'S TEMPORARY SIX  MONTH GOVERNMENT FUNDING  AGREEMENT. I HAVE TELL YOU IT'S GOT ME  JAZZ. IN THAT LIKE JAZZ IT GOES ON  FOREVER AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND  IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS THING, THIS DOCUMENT  RIGHT HERE IS NOT THE BIG NEWS  ROCKING WASHINGTON. THE BIG NEWS EVERYBODY IS  TALKING ABOUT IS THE RENAMING OF  A CONFERENCE ROOM LAST THURSDAY AFTERNOON AT THE CAMPAIGN LEGAL  CENTER, A NONPROFIT DEVOTED TO  CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM WHOSE PRESIDENT IS MY FORMER LAWYER  TREVOR POTTER. FROM HERE ON OUT, THEIR  CONFERENCE ROOM WILL BE CALLED  THE HAM ROVE MEMORIAL CONFERENCE  ROOM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS A MOVING TRIBUTE TO MY  DEARLY DIGESTED FRIEND HAM ROVE  WHO WAS THE CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR COLBERT SUPER PAC. YOU MAY REMEMBER OUR MOTTO  MAKING A BETTER --
TOMORROW.
Stephen: LAST YEAR. TOGETHER HAM ROVE AND I  CONTRIBUTED INDIVIDUAL,  CORPORATE AND UNION DONATIONS TO SUPPORT CANDIDATES IN THE 2012  ELECTION. HAM PICKED THE CANDIDATE SO IT'S  NO SURPRISE THAT A PILE OF LUNCH  MEAT CHOSE THE WHITE BREAD. HAM ROVE MAY BE GONE BUT NOT  FORGOTTEN ESPECIALLY BY ABC NEWS  WHO ASK HAM ROVE'S MENTOR, KARL ROVE, THE QUESTION WE'VE ALL  BEEN WONDERING.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT STEPHEN  COLBERT'S HAM RENDITION OF YOUR  HEAD.
HE'S AN ENTERTAINER BUT WHEN  HE TOOK OUT THE KNIFE AND  STARTING STABBING IT HE MAY NEED SOME COUNSELING OR ENCOURAGING  SOMEBODY TO MAYBE MIMIC HIM. BUT THERE WAS ANXIETY IN HIS  STAB THERE'S.
Stephen: KARL. THERE'S NO NEED FOR ANXIETY. I'M IN NO WAY ENCOURAGING  ANYBODY TO STAB KARL ROVE. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  KARL ROVE AND HAM ROVE. JIMMY PUT UP THE PICTURES. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, JIMMY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JIMMY, NO, NOT TWO HAM ROVES,  ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE KARL. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. BUT, OKAY, BECAUSE EASTER IS  COMING UP I WANT TO ASK  EVERYBODY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NICE JUICY HAM YOU ARE CUTTING  INTO IS NOT KARL ROVE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S AN EASY TEST. BEFORE YOU SLICE INTO YOUR HAM,  ASK IT IF IT EVER PUT ANTI-GAY  MARRIAGE LEGISLATION IN SWING STATES TO TIP THE SCALES IN THE  2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IF IT ANSWERS YES, THAT COULD BE  KARL ROVE. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY IF IT ANSWERS AT ALL,  BETTER NOT EAT IT AT ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND KARL, TO AVOID ANY CONFUSION  WITH HAM ROVE FOR THE NEXT WEEK  OR SO, PLEASE AVOID THE URGE TO COVER YOUR FACE WITH PINEAPPLE  RINGS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: FIGHT IT. FIGHT IT. IN AN UNRELATED NOTE, KARL, IF  YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING THIS  SUNDAY, WHY NOT COME OVER TO MY HOUSE FOR EASTER DINNER? IT'S A POTLUCK, BUT THERE'S NO  NEED FOR TO YOU BRING A DISH. [LAUGHTER] W
