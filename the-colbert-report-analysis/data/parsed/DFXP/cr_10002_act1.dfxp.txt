Captioning sponsored by  COMEDY CENTRAL  Captioning sponsored by  COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR BRAVING THE MARAUDING GANGS AND PACKS OF WILD DOGS THAT NOW RULE THE NIGHT IN AMERICA! (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE AS OF MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OFFICIALLY CLOSED FOR BUSINESS. FINALLY A CHANCE TO USE OUR FAMOUS NATION-BUILDING SKILLS RIGHT AT HOME. (LAUGHTER) AND JIMMY, TELL THE FOLKS WHAT ELSE WE'VE WON.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SHUT ITS DOORS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY TWO DECADES.
THE LANDMARK MONUMENTS AND MUSEUMS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WILL BE SHUT DOWN. I.R.S. TAX REFUNDS WILL BE SUSPENDED. NEW HOME LOANS FROM THE FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION WON'T BE PROCESSED. THE NATION'S 400 NATIONAL PARKS WILL BE SHUT DOWN. VIRTUALLY ALL OF NASA WILL GO DARK.
EMPLOYEES AT THE E.P.A., THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WHICH REGULATES THE QUALITY OF OUR AIR AND WATER, THEY COULD LOSE 94% OF ITS WORK FORCE.
Stephen: NO E.P.A.? OKAY, WELL, TIME TO DUMP SOME OLD HOUSE PAINT DOWN THE STORM DRAIN! (LAUGHTER) THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO. (LAUGHTER) THIS WILL TAKE A SECOND. SORRY. THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SORRY. SORRY, DOLPHINS. YOU HAD A GOOD RUN. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT? WATER USED TO BE BLUE UNTIL I DUMPED THIS (BLEEP) IN THERE. THERE YOU GO. NOW, FOLKS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE SHUTTERED, BUT THE COLBERT NATION IS ALIVE AND WELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I AM PROUD AND PREPARED TO FILL THE POWER VACUUM AS YOU ARE LORD OF THE AFTERSCAPE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) UR-LORD LORD OF THE AFTERSCAPE. BOW BEFORE ME! BRING ME TRIBUTES OF SHEEP AND UNSOILED DAUGHTERS! I ALSO ACCEPT VISA! (LAUGHTER) I WILL SEIZE ALL GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. WHO NEEDS THE F.D.A.? JUST SEND ME YOUR DRUGS. I'LL TEST THEM FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER) FOR INSTANCE, THESE RIGHT HERE BELONG TO -- THESE BELONG TO BRENDA, MY STAGE MANAGER. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WILL LET HER KNOW IN 14 DAYS IF I LOVE LATE. (LAUGHTER) IF I OVULATE. I'M FEELING A LITTLE TENDER. OF COURSE, NOT ALL SERVICES ARE SO EASILY REPLACED.
ALSO DARK, THE NATIONAL ZOO'S PANDA CAM. THE VOLUNTEERS WHO RUN THE CAMERA ARE NOT ALLOWED ON ZOO PROPERTY WHILE THE SHUTDOWN IS IN EFFECT.
Stephen: WELL, THAT ONE REALLY HITS HOME! BUT DON'T WORRY, I GOT THAT ONE COVERED, TOO. JAY, COME ON OUT HERE, EVERYBODY. JAY THE INTERN, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JAY. JAY, HOW'S THE BAMBOO TASTE.
I LOST A TOOTH.
Stephen: WELL, CHOKE IT DOWN, MEI PANG, YOU WILL NEED YOUR STRENGTH FOR MATING.
WHAT? I'M GOING TO MATE WITH A LADY PANDA?
Stephen: NOT A LADY PANDA, JAY. (LAUGHTER) JAY, BACK IN THE CAGE, AMERICA IS WATCHING. COME ON, CHOP-CHOP. COME ON, LET'S GET GOING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GO, GO! DON'T FORGET TO DISPLAY YOUR HAND QUARTERS. HE LIKES THAT. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, DESPITE THE TOTAL FAILURE OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO PERFORM ITS MOST BASIC FUNCTION, THERE'S ALSO SOME BAD NEWS: OBAMACARE IS HERE AND THE OBAMACARE HORROR STORIES ARE ROLLING IN.
THE OBAMACARE BUMPY START ALREADY. ERROR MESSAGES, GLITCHES IN THE FIRST FEW HOURS.
Stephen: SOME INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE EXPERIENCING EVEN MORE SEVERE GLITCHES. IF YOU TRIED TO SIGN UP IN NEW JERSEY THIS MORNING YOU WERE TOLD THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS DOWN!
THE FEDERALLY RUN SITE FOR OBAMACARE EXCHANGES IN 36 STATES IS POSTING ERROR MESSAGES BECAUSE IT CAN NOT HANDLE THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC.
Stephen: TOO MANY PEOPLE SIGNING UP IS ALWAYS THE SUREST SIGN THAT NOBODY WANTS IT. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN IF, FOLKS, EVEN IF THE SIGN-UP PROCESS WORKS PERFECTLY, FOX HOST SUSTEREN VAN GRETA KNOWS THAT THIS SO-CALLED HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE WILL LEAVE PEOPLE BEHIND.
IF I DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER, WHAT ABOUT ME?
THERE IS A CALL-IN -- CALL CENTER FOR FOLKS WHO WOULD PREFER TO DO IT OVER THE PHONE AND THERE ARE ALSO IN-PERSON ASSISTERS, PEOPLE CALLED NAVIGATORS WHO SORT OF TEAMED UP WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, CHURCHES, ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT TO OFFER IN PERSON.
Stephen: WHERE DO I GO? HOW DO I KNOW? IT'S LIKE I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.
THEY -- THAT'S SORT OF THE EASIEST WAY TO FIND OUT WHERE TO GO IS HEALTH CARE.GOV.
SO I NEED A COMPUTER!
Stephen: OH, SO THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT REQUIRES EVERYONE TO BUY A COMPUTER. (LAUGHTER) WHICH YOU CAN'T EVEN ORDER ONLINE WITHOUT, YOU GUESSED IT, A COMPUTER. (LAUGHTER) SO NOW I NEED TWO COMPUTERS? (LAUGHTER) WELCOME TO OBAMA'S AMERICA! THERE WAS SOME OTHER WAY TO SIGN UP? WHAT WAS THAT?
THERE IS A CALL-IN -- A CALL CENTER FOR FOLKS WHO WOULD PREFER TO DO IT OVER THE PHONE.
Stephen: THE PHONE? YOU MEAN MR. BELL'S DEMON BOX? (LAUGHTER) HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO NAVIGATE THIS INFERNAL CONTRAPTION? I DON'T HAVE A CLUE! I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. WHY IS THERE EVEN A HASHTAG BUTTON DOWN HERE? (LAUGHTER) ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TWEET OUR HEALTH PROBLEMS NOW? (LAUGHTER) HASHTAG THUNDER JUNK. GREAT. NOW EVERYBODY IN AMERICA KNOWS I HAVE THAT CHRONIC THUNDER JUNK. (LAUGHTER) CLEARLY JUST SIGNING UP FOR THIS BOONDOGGLE IS A CASK AESQUE LABYRINTH WRAPPED IN AN M.C. ESCHER PAINTING TRAPPED IN ONE OF THOSE CLAM SHELL HEADPHONE PACKAGES. I WILL SEE YOU IN HELL, PANASONIC! (LAUGHTER) BUT, FOLKS, ALL IS NOT LOST. THERE IS ONE LAST HOPE FOR DEFEATING OBAMACARE.
THERE'S A MESSAGE WAR UNDER WAY AND THE TARGET IS HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE. SO IF YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE, FOR INSURANCE ON THE INSURANCE EXCHANGES WHEN IT OPENS, WHEN THEY OPEN OCTOBER 1, THE LAW IS GOING TO BE IN REAL TROUBLE.
THEY NEED THESE PEOPLE. THEY NEED THEIR PREMIUMS TO COVER THOSE WHO ARE SICKER AND HAVE HIGHER COSTS.
Stephen: YES. OBAMACARE NEEDS THE PREMIUMS OF HEALTHIER PEOPLE TO COVER THE COSTS OF SICKER PEOPLE. IT'S A DEVIOUS CON THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS -- INSURANCE. (LAUGHTER) SO, FOLKS, THE BATTLE COMES DOWN TO WHO CAN WIN OVER THE YOUNG. AND THE PRESIDENT IS TROLLING FOR OUR KIDS ON THE INTERNET.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS TWEETING PHOTOS OF HAMSTERS AND PANDAS, REBRANDING IT AS THE ADORABLE CARE ACT.
IT'S A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN CALLED THE ADORABLE CARE ACT FEATURES PICTURES OF THESE CUTE LITTLE ANIMALS ALONGSIDE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT FOR THE HEALTH CARE LAW. THAT ONE, I BELIEVE, IS A MOUSE. IT COULD BE A HAMSTER, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: IT COULD BE A MOUSE, IT COULD BE A HAMSTER, I DON'T KNOW. THANKS TO OBAMACARE, IT COULD BE A RAT THAT HAD GERBIL REASSIGNMENT SURGERY. (LAUGHTER) WHO KNOWS? SICK STUFF. SICK STUFF. FOLKS, I AM SHOCKED THAT DEMOCRATS ARE ENGAGED IN THIS CRUDE EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION! THEY'RE USUALLY NOT THIS GOOD AT IT. (LAUGHTER) SO TONIGHT I HAVE STARTED A CAMPAIGN I'M CALLING THE ABOMINABLE CARE ACT FEATURING UGLY ANIMALS REVEALING THE TRUE DANGERS OF OBAMACARE. FOR INSTANCE, "I PICK MY OWN DOCTOR AND HE CUT OFF MY BALLS, THANKS, OBAMACARE!" (LAUGHTER) FORTUNATELY I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT HERE FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE SCOURGE OF AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE. THERE'S ALSO GENERATION OPPORTUNITY, A POLITICAL GROUP FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FUNDED BY THE KOCH BROTHERS. THE K-BRAHS! BROS BEFORE H.M.O.s! (LAUGHTER) THE KOCHS GO WITH YOUTH LIKE PEANUT BUTTER GOES WITH ENSURING. (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S UP? GENERATION OPPORTUNITY IS SPEARHEADING A CAMPAIGN ENCOURAGING YOUTH TO OPT OUT OF OBAMACARE. AS THE GROUP'S PRESIDENT YOUTH RAPS TO THE STREET KIDS "WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE IS, NO, YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY A FINE BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE CHEAPER FOR YOU AND BETTER FOR YOU." YES! IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAPER AND BETTER FOR YOU! NOT ONLY DO YOU GET TO PAY A FINE, YOU ALSO DON'T GET INSURANCE! IT'S LIKE RENTING INSTEAD OF BUYING AND THEN NOT GETTING A PLACE TO LIVE! (LAUGHTER) AND TO REACH THE YOUNG LINGS, GEN-OP IS HOSTING COLLEGE FOOTBALL TAILGATE PARTIES AND PASSING OUT BEER KOOZIES THAT READ "OPT OUT." THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. BECAUSE WHY WOULD A DRUNK COLLEGE STUDENT EVER NEED HEALTH INSURANCE? (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK-- THOUGH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS GUY. (LAUGHTER)
