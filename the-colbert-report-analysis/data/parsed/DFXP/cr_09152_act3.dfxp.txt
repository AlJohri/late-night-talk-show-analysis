RIGHT.
Stephen: SO LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING ALOHA.
ALOHA.
Stephen: AND BY THAT OF COURSE I MEAN HELLO-HA.
NOT THE GOOD-BYE ALOHA BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE.
-- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.
JUST BACK TO YOU.
Stephen: BACK TO YOU, OKAY. I'M A FAN OF YOUR MUSIC, DONE GET ME WRONG, OKAY AM BUT I GOT A PROBLEM WITH YOU, OKAY. I LIKE ROCK 'N' ROLL BECAUSE I'M NOT AFRAID OF ROCK 'N' ROLL, ROCK 'N' ROLL, I REQUEST KEEP MY AND WE ARE A LOT OF ROCK 'N' ROLL. BECAUSE THERE IS SOME ANGER IN ROCK 'N' ROLL, YOU KNOW. YOUR MUSIC IS SO CHILLAX THAT I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE ABLE TO KEEP MY RAGE.
HOW YOU CAN BE SO CHILL. WHERE DO YOU PUT YOUR RAGE? DO YOU STORE IN ANYWHERE ON YOUR BODY? PERHAPS YOUR-- PERHAPS YOUR FEET? THAT'S WHY SHOES JUST BURST INTO FLAMES WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON?
IT'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION.
Stephen: YOU HAVE NO ANGER.
NO, I DO.

I'LL GIVE THAT YOU.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU WRITE A LOT OF LOVE SONGS, OKAY.

Stephen: HOW MANY LOVE SONGS HAVE YOU WRITTEN TO YOUR WIFE?
I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY 30, 40.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WOW. HAS SHE FORGIVEN YOU YET FOR WHATEVER IT WAS?
I THINK SO.
Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE HOW DO YOU-- HOW DOES A JACK JOHNSON RELAX, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BECAUSE IF YOUR CAREER, IF YOUR CAREER PATH IS STRUMMING ON A GUITAR AND SINGING TO THE OCEAN, HOW DO YOU KICKBACK, LIKE CRAWL INTO A PILLOWCASE FULL OF BABY LAMBS OR-- GET A MASSAGE FROM A OCTOPUS MADE OF FEATHERS? HOW DO YOU-- WAS'S RELAXING TO YOU BECAUSE YOUR WORK IS RELAXING?
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME? WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN ME IN TRYING TO KEEP A FEATHER AFLOAT.
SURE.
Stephen: DO WE DO IT TOGETHER.
Stephen: WE'LL GO BACK AND FORTH.
