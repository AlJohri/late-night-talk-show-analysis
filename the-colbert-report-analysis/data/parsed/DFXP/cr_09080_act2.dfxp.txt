[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. THANKS SO MUCH  YOUNG NATION, YOU KNOW I GET  YOU, WITH YOUR VINE-ING AND YOUR  VAMPIRE DIARIES AND YOUR LINCOLN  LOGS. [LAUGHTER] AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I GET  YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT  DEMOGRAPHIC. THE LAST ELECTION PROVED THAT IF  THEY'RE EVER GONNA WIN AGAIN,  THE GOP NEEDS TO CAPTURE THE YOUTH VOTE. FEAR NOT, REPUBLICANS ARE ON IT. JUST THIS WEEK, THEY OFFERED  YOUNGSTERS THE ONE THING THEY  SIMPLY CAN'T RESIST: A SURVEY! [LAUGHTER] YOU HEAR THAT, KIDS? IT'S LIKE THE S.A.T., BUT  FOR FUN, DAWG! [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MESSING  AROUND WITH THIS SURVEY, BECAUSE  IT'S HOSTED BY surveymonkey.com, AMERICA'S MOST TRUSTED SIMIAN  DATA-COLLECTION SERVICE. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THIS SURVEY IS PRECISELY  TARGETED AT YOUTHS ONLY, BECAUSE  IT CLEARLY STATES: "PLEASE DO 'NOT' TAKE THIS  SURVEY IF YOU ARE 30 YEARS OF  AGE OR OLDER."  ALL RIGHT THEN. HERE I GO. [LAUGHTER] AND LET ME TELL YOU: SOME OF THE  QUESTIONS ON THIS BAD BOY ARE  TOTES MAD POPPIN' FRESH. [LAUGHTER] SUCH AS NUMERO THIRTY-SIXO,  WHICH ADDRESSES YOUNG VOTERS'  LOVE OF DIVERSITY. ASKING, "DO YOU THINK THAT THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY DISCRIMINATES  AGAINST PEOPLE? IF SO, WHICH PEOPLE?" [LAUGHTER] WITH OPTIONS INCLUDING  AFRICAN AMERICANS, WHITE PEOPLE,  LATINOS, ASIANS, GAYS AND  LESBIANS. OR:  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOES NOT  DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE"  THAT'S EASY THE ANSWER IS THE G.O.P. DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE  AGAINST ANYONE. LEAST OF ALL WHITE PEOPLE, WHO  ARE THE ONLY OPTION THE SURVEY  REFERS TO AS PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MAKES IT EASY. BUT MY PERSONAL FAVO-RAVE IS  QUESTION THIRTY-EIGHT:  "WHAT IS YOUR SEXUAL  ORIENTATION?" "STRAIGHT, GAY, BISEXUAL OR IN  THE CLOSET"? [LAUGHTER] YES, IN THE CLOSET. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON  STRUGGLING WITH YOUR SEXUALITY,  THERE'S NO SAFER PLACE TO COME OUT THAN ON A REPUBLICAN SURVEY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DON'T WORRY, THESE CONSERVATIVES  WILL NEVER JUDGE YOU. EXCEPT FOR THESE CONSERVATIVE  JUDGES. [LAUGHTER] AND I FOR ONE AM GLAD TO SEE THE  GOP BEING SO INCLUSIVE. WHO AMONG US HASN'T HAD A FRIEND  OR FAMILY MEMBER COME OUT AS  "IN THE CLOSET"? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE IN "THE  CLOSET", YOU SHOULDN'T CLICK "IN  THE CLOSET", BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL BE "OUT OF THE CLOSET" WHICH  MEANS, IF YOU DIDN'T CHECK THAT  BOX MESSAGE RECEIVED. POINT IS, THE GOP IS ON YOUR  SIDE CLOSETED NATION! YOU CAN BE PROUD AND OUT ABOUT  BEING ASHAMED AND IN! [LAUGHTER] JUST GET OUT THERE AND LET THE  WORLD KNOW, WE'RE HERE, WE'RE IN  DENIAL, DALE IS MY ROOMMATE! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IF YOU'RE UNDER 30, I URGE  YOU TO JOIN THE GOP'S YOUTH  MOVEMENT AND TAKE THIS RAD SURVEY AT THE EXTREEEEEME-LY  MEMORABLE WEB ADDRESS:  Www.surveymonkey.com/s/8pxhd8y REMEMBER, THAT "Y" STANDS FOR  YOLO, WHICH IS PROBABLY  SOMETHING IN SPANISH. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW. WE HAVEN'T REACHED OUT TO  LATINOS YET. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
