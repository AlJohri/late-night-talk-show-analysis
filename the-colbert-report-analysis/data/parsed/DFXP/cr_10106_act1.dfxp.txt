( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WHOOO! WHOOO! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. NATION-- THANK YOU. FOLKS, IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE TO SAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I KNOW THIS IS NOT GOING TO COME TO ANY SURPRISE TO ALL YOU HEROES OUT THERE BUT I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH RUSSIA. VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS BEEN OUT-MASCULATING BARACK OBAMA AT EVERY TURN. IT'S LIKE OBAMA IS PLAYING CHECKERS, AND PUTIN IS ALSO PLAYING CHECKERS BUT DOING IT SHIRTLESS WHILE RIDING A HORSE.  PUTIN'S STREAK OF MAN-CHIEVEMENT CONTINUED ON SATURDAY
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS BUSY PLAYING HOCKEY IN SOCHI. THE GAME REPORTEDLY AIRED ON RUSSIAN TELEVISION SATURDAY NIGHT. PRESIDENT PUTIN SUPPOSEDLY LED A TEAM OF HOCKEY STARS, INCLUDING FORMER NHL-ERS TO A 24-1 WIN.
HE SHOOTS. HE SCORES. SPECTATORS SAW THAT EARLY AND OFTEN FROM AN EXHIBITION HOCKEY GAME.
PUTIN DAZZLED THE CROWD, WAS ABLE TO SCORE SIX GOALS IN A SINGLE GAME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THE OTHER TEAM-- THE OTHER TEAM WOULD HAVE TRIED TO STOP PUTIN, BUT HIS GAMES OFTEN END IN SUDDEN DEATH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW JUST TAKE A LOOK AT PUTIN IN A SHOW MANY ARE CALLING "DICTATOR ON ICE." HE'S SUCH A SPEED DEMON, THE PROFESSIONAL GOALIES TRIP OVER THEIR OWN SKATES AS SOON AS HE APPROACHES. BUT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING ABOUT PUTIN'S PERFORMANCE IS THAT IT WAS ONLY SIX YEARS AGO THAT HE LEARNED TO SKATE. AND THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF HIS HOCKEY TRAINING WERE SPENT PUTTING THE HELMET ON BACKWARDS. WHILE HE'S HITTING SLAPSHOTS, WE'RE SLAPPING HIM WITH SANCTIONS. IN RESPONSE, PUTIN HAS THROWN A HIGH-STAKES HISSY FIT.
RUSSIA ANNOUNCED TODAY IT WOULD KEEP U.S. ASTRONAUTS OFF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AFTER THE YEAR 2020. THE PROBLEM IS, THE RUSSIANS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO GET THERE. THE AMERICANS HITCH A RIDE ON THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT.  THE TWO NATIONS HAVE COOPERATED IN SPACE FOR OVER TWO DECADES
THEY'RE CUTTING OFF AMERICA'S ACCESS TO THE SPACE STATION, VLADIMIR PUTIN FIRING BACK OVER UKRAINE SANCTIONS SAYING RUSSIA WILL NOT HELP LAUNCH AMERICANS INTO SPACE PAST 2020.
Stephen:  RUSSIA-- OUR SPACE BOYFRIENDS BROKE UP WITH US AND, OF COURSE, THE WORST PART OF EVERY BREAKUP IS CANCELLING THE TRIP YOU HAD PLANNED FOR SIX YEARS FROM NOW. THIS IS SO AWKWARD BECAUSE RIGHT NOW RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS ARE UP THERE TOGETHER. WE'RE STILL LIVING TOGETHER IN THE SAME PLACE. NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ALL WEIRD BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER WHEN WE NEED TO USE THE WASTE VENT. THE RUSSIANS AREN'T JUST BREAKING UP WITH US. THEY'RE MOCKING US. RUSSIAN SPACE OFFICIAL AND SLAVIC CHRIS CHRISTIE DIMITRI ROGOZIN-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) HE TWEETED, "I SUGGEST THE U.S. DELIVERS ITS ASTRONAUTS TO THE I.S.S. WITH A TRAMPOLINE. HA-HA-HILARIOUS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T NEED A TRAMPOLINE BECAUSE WE'LL JUST GET INTO ORBIT ON OUR NEW ROCKET. THREE, TWO, ONE. HOUSTON! WE HAVE LIFTOFF! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DELIVERED ITS PAYLOAD. AND, OH, OH, RUSSIA, OH, NO. OUR ASTRONAUTS WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO TAKING OFF FROM SUNNY FLORIDA INSTEAD OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESORT TOWN OF BAIKONUR, KAZAKHSTAN. IN THE MEANTIME, RUSSIA'S PLAYING RIGHT INTO OUR HANDS, FOLKS. THEY DON'T REALIZE AMERICA'S GOT A SECRET WEAPON ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION-- MY TREADMILL, THE COMBINED OPERATIONAL LOAD-BEARING EXTERNAL RESISTANCE TREADMILL, OR THE COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, LOOK, RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW, SOMEBODY IS ON IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S PROBABLY NOT AN AMERICAN BECAUSE HE'S EXERCISING. OKAY. TIME TO SPRING THE TRAP. ATTENTION! ATTENTION, COLBERT TREADMILL ACTIVATE CRISIS PROTOCOL ALPHA, GAMMA, VICTOR. TRANSFORM THE PLASMA CANNONS TO  RETAKE THE I.S.S. FOR AMERICA. ENGAGE, TREADMILL. HELLO? IS THIS ON? ( LAUGHTER ) ALTERNATIVE PLAN, TREADMILL, CONTINUE OPERATING NORMALLY AND MAKE HIM ALL SWEATY. GOOD TREADMILL. KILL! ( LAUGHTER ) COULD'VE SWORN MY TREADMILL WAS A DECEPTICON   ( CHEERS ) NATION, THERE IS NOTHING THAT GETS ME MORE EXCITED THAN A GOOD POLITICAL RIVALRY.  BUSH V. GORE BUSH V. BORE. BUSH V. DOOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, BUCKLE UP, FOLKS, BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW POLITICAL BATTLE ROYALE,  KARL VERSUS HILLARY. AND LAST WEEK KARL CAME OUT SWINGING
KARL ROVE SUGGESTED HILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE.
TONIGHT, KARL ROVE SLAMMING HILLARY CLINTON--
THE HEADLINE IN THE "NEW YORK POST" SCREAMING, "KARL ROVE, HILLARY MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE."
ROVE WAS TALKING ABOUT HILLARY'S TREATMENT AFTER SHE SUFFERED A FALL AND CONCUSSION IN 2012.
HE SAID THIS, "30 DAYS IN A HOSPITAL AND WHEN SHE REAPPEARS SHE'S WEARING GLASSES FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH THAT."
Stephen:  YEAH, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT. CONGRESS MUST CONVENE A SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE WHATNESS OF THAT BEING UP? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A LOT OF SELECT COMMITTEE FANS HERE TONIGHT. NATION, THIS IS A SERIOUS SCANDAL BECAUSE ROVE'S CONJECTURE IS BASED ON SOLID FACTS. HILLARY CLINTON DID GO TO THE HOSPITAL AFTER A CONCUSSION IN 2012, AND SHE LATER EXHIBITED SOME VERY STRANGE BEHAVIOR IN HER BENGHAZI TESTIMONY. SHE HAD A MASTERY OF THE FACTS AND AN UNSHAKABLE CONFIDENCE, ALL WHILE WEARING THOSE STUPID GLASSES. I MEAN, THEY'RE, LIKE-- THESE THINGS ARE LIKE ORTHOPEDIC SHOES FOR YOUR FACE. YOU'D HAVE TO BE BRAIN DAMAGED TO WEAR THOSE, OR NEARSIGHTED, WHICH I BELIEVE IS CAUSED BY BRAIN DAMAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HILLARY'S SHOWN SIGNS OF MENTAL FRAILTY BEFORE. JUST LOOK AT THESE PANTS SHE WORE IN THE 1970s. ( LAUGHTER ) GIRL, THAT IS IS A TRAUMATIC FASHION INJURY. OF COURSE, THE LIBERAL MEDIA ATTACKED, SO ROVE WENT ON FOX NEWS TO UN-POLOGIZE.
MY POINT WAS THAT HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, BUT SHE WOULD NOT BE HUMAN IF THIS DIDN'T ENTER IN AS A CONSIDERATION, IF-- IF-- AND-- AND MY OTHER POINT IS THIS WILL BE AN ISSUE IN THE 2016 RACE, WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT. LOOK, SHE'LL BE 69 BY THE TIME OF THE 2016 ELECTION. SHE-- SHE WILL BE 77 IF SHE SERVES TWO TERMS. AND THIS ENDS UP BEING AN ISSUE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DOCTORS SAID ABOUT WHAT SHE HAS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. SHE'S HIDDEN A LOT.
Stephen:  YES, SHE'S HIDDEN A LOT. WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER DISEASES WE COULD WONDER IF SHE HAS. ( LAUGHTER ) SCURVY? GINGIVITIS? RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME? COOPER'S DROOP? COULD SHE HAVE POPCORN LUNG? AND KARL'S ONLY BRINGING THIS UP BECAUSE THE MEDIA IS GOING TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF IT ANYWAY. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HOW MUCH THEY'VE BEEN MAKING AN ISSUE OF IT SINCE KARL BROUGHT IT UP.
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT KARL WANTS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT.
HE WANTED US TO START FOCUSING ON HILLARY'S HEALTH. HE WANTS TO RAISE SUSPICION.
KARL ROVE HAS GOTTEN EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AND IT'S BEEN MAKING NEWS. IT'S BEEN ON PROGRAMS NOW ON CABLE NEWS FOR THE PAST 10-24 HOURS.
IT WAS TOTALLY FABRICATED. THEN HE PULLS IT BACK. NOW WE'RE HAVING THIS WHOLE SEGMENT ON IT.   ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  YEAH! EVERYBODY IN THE NEWS IS TALKING ABOUT IT, EVEN-- EVEN THIS GUY OVER HERE. THAT GUY RIGHT THERE, WATCH, WATCH. I BETTER HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT HILLARY'S BRAIN DAMAGE. HE JUST DID IT! HE JUST SAID IT! MAYBE HE'LL SAY IT AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) NAH. NAH, HE'S JUST-- HE'S EATING POPCORN RIGHT NOW. MAN. THE MEDIA. YOU GUYS ARE ( BLEEP ) UP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I THINK I'VE GOT POPCORN LUNG. ALL KARL ROVE IS SAYING IS THAT HILLARY IS A PUBLIC FIGURE AND WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT HER BRAIN. FOLKS, THERE IS ANOTHER PUBLIC FIGURE WHO WORRIES ME EVEN MORE-- KARL ROVE. BECAUSE HE SAID THAT HILLARY SPENT 30 DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN IN FACT SHE WAS THERE FOR ONLY THREE DAYS. HAS KARL ROVE LOST TRACK OF TIME BECAUSE HE HAS A SERIOUS BRAIN INJURY? I'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION. I MEAN, FOR SOME REASON, HE IS PROTECTING HIS SKULL WITH A THICK CUSHION OF MEAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE'S JUST YANKING THESE STORIES ABOUT HILLARY'S HEALTH RIGHT OUT OF HIS ASS, BUT BECAUSE HE WEARS THOSE ORTHOPEDIC PANTS AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW IF KARL ROVE HAS AN ASS. HE COULD SUFFER FROM A RARE CONDITION WHERE THE LOWER INTESTINAL TRACK IS REROUTED TO THE CRANIAL CAVITY. IT'S CALLED "COPROENCEPHALOPATHY" OR IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, ( BLEEP ) FOR BRAINS. WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. I HAVE TO SAY, HIS MOUTH EXHIBITS ALL THE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS. I'M JUST ASKING, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
