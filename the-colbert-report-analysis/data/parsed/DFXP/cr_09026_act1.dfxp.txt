CAN.
Stephen:  TONIGHT, SCANDAL  AT THE C.I.A. WHY CAN'T CLARE DANES GET HER  ( BLEEP ) TOGETHER?   ( LAUGHTER )   THEN CAN METH BE MEDICINE? FOUR OUT OF FIVE SPIEDS, OR YOUR  FACE SAY YES. AND MY GUEST CHRIS STRINGER IS A  PALEOANTHROPOLOGIST WHO SAYS ALL  HUMANS CAME FROM AFRICA. SEE, I TOLD YOU OBAMA WAS FROM  KENYA.   ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE )   THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO PARDON  A TURKEY. WHAT DID THE TURKEY KNOW ABOUT  BENGHAZI?   ( LAUGHTER )   THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )    ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. FOLKS, I'M IN THE TV BIZ, WHERE  IT'S ALL ABOUT THE DEMO GRAPHICS  -- THE DEMO, WE CALL IT. SO I WORK HARD TO APPEAL TO THE  MILLENNIALS. FOR EXAMPLE, BY CALLING THEM  MILLENNIALS.   (  LAUGHTER  )   YOUNG PEOPLE LOVE BEING TARGET  MARKETED BY THEIR BIRTHS DATE  AND PURCHASING POWER, YOU KNOW, GANGNAM STYLE.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT  THEY EAT IT UP! THAT'S WHY-- THAT'S WHY I STAY  UP ON ALL THE HOTTEST MILLENNIAL  TRENDS. AND RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NOTHING  18- TO 34-YEAR-OLD UPPER  MIDDLE-INCOME KIDS LOVE MORE THAN SOUP, PLAYAH! YOU NEED PROOF? WELL, LET ME SCHOOL YOU ON  AMERICA'S HOTTEST LIQUID FOOD  TREND, CAMPBELL'S GO, THE NEW YOUTH-SCWUG LINE OF SUMES MADE  ESPECIALLY FOR MILLENNIALS. THAT'S RIGHT. EVERY AMERICAN GENERATION IS  DEFINED BY ONE THING-- THE  GREATEST GENERATION STOPPED  HITLER. THE BABY BOOMERS STOPPED THE  VIETNAM WAR. AND THIS GENERATION WILL GO DOWN  IN HISTORY FOR DEMANDING  DIFFERENT SOUP.   ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE )   ACCORDING-- ACCORDING TO THE  COMPANY, CAMPBELL'S GO IS A NEW LINE OF SUMES DESIGNED FOR  PEOPLE LIKE US-- FUN, BUSY,  YOUNGISH.   ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE )   FOLKS, I THINK THIS MARKETING  CAMPAIGN IS GREAT-ISH.  NOW, I BET YOU'RE SAYING, HEY,  THESE NEW CANS OF SOUP CAN'T GET  AND MORE DOPE. HAIL TO THE NAH BECAUSE THEY  COME IN A BAG NOW, BIATCH! YEAH!   ( APPLAUSE )   LOOK AT THAT GUY. LOOK AT THAT GUY RIGHT THERE. HE'S GOING, "WHAT UP, SOUP?"    ( LAUGHTER )   JAM A STRAW IN IT, OKAY. IT'S LIKE CAPRI SOUP.  AND BECAUSE IT'S SO HIP, HOME  SLICE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE  ADS ON THE TV. NO, THAT'S FOR SQUARES. YOU GOTTA SURF OVER TO THE  GAMBLE'S GO WEB SITE EMY,  TUMBLIR GRAPHICS THAT CAPTURE THE SPIRIT AND ENERGY ONE  ASSOCIATES WITH SOUP. OF COURSE, YOU'RE PROBABLY  THINKING WHAT'S SOUP WITHOUT  MUSIC? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.   (  LAUGHTER  )   WELL, THEY GOT THAT COVERED,  TOO, BECAUSE CAMPBELL'S HAS  PARTNER WITH THE MUSIC SERVICE SPOTTIFY SO CONSUMERS CAN CREATE  CUSTOM PLAYLISTS BUILT OFF THE  PERSONA OF THE SOUP. SOUP-INSPIRED PLAYLISTS! IT'S LIKE A MIX TAPE YOU MAKE  FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND, ONLY YOUR  GIRLFRIEND IS A BAG OF SOUP.   ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE )     ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   FOR EXAMPLE, I CHOSE TOM PETTY'S "A WASTED LIFE "TO DESCRIBE  WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THIS  MARKETING CAMPAIGN.   ( LAUGHTER )   SOUP! NOW, NATION, EVER SINCE FORMER  C.I.A. DIRECTOR DAVID PETRAEUS  REVEALED HIS TORRID AFFAIR, THE SCANDAL HAS THE ENTIRE  NEWS-SCAPE IN A TIZZY.
THE SEX SCANDAL THAT'S ROCKED  WASHINGTON.
A SALACIOUS SEX SCANDAL  INVOLVING THE NOW-FORMER C.I.A. DIRECTOR.
BREAKING NEW DETAILS ON THE  FAST-MOVING C.I.A. SEX SCANDAL.
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE  FISCAL CLIFF BUT I'M DYING TO  ASK YOU ABOUT THE SCANDAL BECAUSE IT'S ALL ANYONE'S  ABOUT.G TALKING
Stephen:  YEAH. THIS SEX SCANDAL IS ALL ANYBODY  IN WASHINGTON CAN TALK ABOUT. I WONDER WHY THE COUNTRY IS IN  FINANCIAL RUIN?   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   WELL, FOLKS, I MAY BE A NEWS  JUNKY, BUT I ALSO GOT TO HAVE MY  STORIES. AND THIS IS BOTH. IT'S LIKE A STEAMY EPISODE OF  "GENERAL'S HOSPITAL."    ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE ) AND THESE DAYS-- THESE DAYS,  INFORMATION, I SPEND MY  AFTERNOONS YOU KNOW PLOPPED ON THE COUCH IN THE HOUSECOAT,  WATCHING CNN WITH A VIRGINIA  SLIM IN BON HAND AND A BOX OF AFTER 8s IN THE OTHER. I DON'T CARE IF THE NEWS GOES  STRAIGHT TO MY HIMSELF. IT IS ME TIME. THIS STORY HAS GOT EVERYTHING--  A DECORATED WAR HERO HAS AN  AFFAIR WITH HIS OWN SEXY BIOGRAPHER, WHO SENSES THE SPY  MASTER IS STEPPING OUT ON HER  WITH A SECOND GIRLFRIEND, SO SHE SENDS AN E-MAIL FROM A SECRET  ACCOUNT SAYING STEP OFF OR I  WILL CUT, BIATCH. AND THE SECOND HOTTIE FREAKS OUT  AND CONTACTS HER FRIENDS, F.B.I. AGENT, WHO LAUNCHES AN  INVESTIGATION, BUT GETS PULLED  OFF THE CASE BECAUSE HE SEXED HER A SHIRTLESS PHOTO. THE SPY MASTERY PROTEGE, ALSO A  GENERAL, HAS SENT THOUSANDS OF  E-MAILS TO THE SECOND WOMAN. THIS ISN'T JUST A LOVE TRIANGLE,  INFORMATION. IT'S A LOVE PENTAGON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I GOTTA SAY-- I GOTTA SAY, AFTER  THAT, IT GETS A LITTLE  FARFETCHED. I MEAN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE  SECOND WOMAN HANS EMOTIONALLY  TROUBLED IDENTICAL TWIN. AND BOTH THE SPY MAST EXPERT  GENERAL WRITE LETTERS OF SUPPORT  FOR THE TWIN SISTER'S CUSTODY BATTLE WITH HER ECONCLUSION? OH, AND LISTEN TO THE NAME THEY  CAME UP WITH FOR HIM? GRAYSON WOLF.  JIMMY, WE DON'T HAVE A PICTURE  OF HIM YET, SO JUST PUT UP A  VISUAL APPROXIMATION. THAT'S RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S JUST  NOT BELIEVABLE ANYMORE.   (  LAUGHTER  )   I-- I THINK THE NEWS HAS JUMPED  THE SHARK.  AND THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE  PARTS, THEY SAY THAT-- THAT--  THAT THE GENERAL DOWN THERE, THAT GENERAL OVER THERE, HE IS  THE TOP COMMANDER OF OUR WAR IN  AFGHANISTAN. AFGHANISTAN? REALLY?   ( LAUGHTER )   PLEASE.  IF OUR TROOPS WERE REALLY STILL  FIGHTING IN AFGHANISTAN, DON'T  YOU THINK WE'D BE HEARING ABOUT THAT ON THE NEWS INSTEAD OF ALL  THIS BULL ( BLEEP )?   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NOT BELIEVABLE. ANYWAY. ANYWAY, BOTTOM LINE, IT'S A SOAP  OPERA AND IT IS DONE. WE SHOULD ALL MOVE ON.
