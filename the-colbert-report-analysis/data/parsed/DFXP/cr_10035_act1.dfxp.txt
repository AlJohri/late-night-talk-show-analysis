WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN,STEP EN!
Stephen: THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, LET'S GET RIGHT TO OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT. I'VE GOT AN INCOMING NEWS FLASH. I BELIEVE IN GOD. AND FRANKLY, I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH ATHEISTS, THEY'RE SO SMUG AND ANNOYING. AND IF THEY ARE CREATED IN YOUR IMAGE, THEN YOU ARE A JERK. (LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS ATTACK OUR SACRED HOLIDAYS. I MEAN BABY JESUS ASK IN SO MUCH DANGER THIS YEAR THAT PROTECT HIS IDENTITY WE HAVE TO CALL HIS BIRTHDAY X-MASS. THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON GRINCHITUDE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS THE SECULAR (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOLKS THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVES OUT THERE ARE ONCE AGAIN COMING AFTER OUR CHRISTMAS DISPLAYS-- DISPLAYS. I CAN'T EVEN PUT UP A REINDEER WITHOUT SOME GUY TELLING ME TO GET OFF THE ROOF OF TEMPLE BETH ELOHIM. AND FOR THE LATEST ATTACK WE GO TO THE GRETCH WHO LOVED CHRISTMAS.
REMEMBER THIS CLASSIC SEINFELD MOMENT?
NO A NEARLY 6 FOOT  TALLFESTIVUS POLL MADE OF EMPTY BEER CANS ABOUT TO GO UP TO THE FLORIDA STATE CAPITOL,.
THAT'S RIGHT, IN ADDITION TO THE NATIVITY SCENE, THE FLORIDA STATE CAPITOL HAS A FESTIVUS POLE, A MENORAH AND A MONUMENT TO THE AZTEC SNAKE GOODE GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT. SURELY, SURELY--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SURELY I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE, I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS SO OUTRAGED BY THIS.
I AM SO OUTRAGED BY THIS. WHY DO I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH MY KIDS TO LOOK FOR NATIVITY SCENES AND BE LIKE OH, YEAH, KIDS, LOOK, THERE'S BABY JESUS BEHIND THEFESTIVUS POLE MADE OUT OF BEER CANS. IT'S NUTS. AND I'M ALLERGIC.
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LOOK THE A PILE OF BOTHER CANS WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SHOW YOUR KIDS POSITIVE IMAGES LIKE LEAVING A BABY OUTSIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER. BUT THAT WANE EVEN THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS PART OF GRETCHEN'S HOUR OF OUTRAGE.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHRISTIANITY STOLE THE SEASON FROM THE SOLSTICE.
THAT A NEW HEADLINE FOR ME, THAT SOMEHOW CHRISTIANS STOLE CHRISTMAS FROM THE --
THAT IS RIDICULOUS. WHAT IS NEXT, YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME THAT JESUS WAS JEWISH, COME ON. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I AM SO-- I WAS SO--  (APPLAUSE) I UNDERSTAND, THAT IS HOW YOU KEEP JESUS ALIVE, YOU KEEP CLAPPING. I WAS SO ENRAGED BY THIS CLAIM THAT I DID SOMETHING I'M NOT PROUD OF, RESEARCH. IT TURNAL-- IT TURNS OUT OCCASIONALLY WE CHIST YENS HAVE ABSORBED OTHER SEASONAL TRADITION INTO OUR OWN. FOR EXAMPLE, GIFT-GIVING WAS DON'TED FROM A ROMAN FESTIVAL. CHRISTMAS TREES CAME FROM THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CUSTOM WORSHIPPING THE GOD RA WITH A PALM RUSH AND SANTA IS BASED ON A WAR LORD CRINGE ELS THE UNJOLLY WHO LAID WASTE TO HIS ENEMIES IN COAL FIRE. HE NOSE LIKE A CHEREE FROM THE BLOOD OF THE VANQUISHED WHOSE BODIES HE BURIED. SO I SAY, WE SHOULD STOP THESE ATHEISTS BY ABSORBING THEIR FESTIVUS TRADITION LIKE SOME SORT OF YULETIDE BORG. IT WILL BE EASY, AFTER ALL, JESUS WAS THE ORIGINAL CHEREE. THINK ABOUT T HE WAS A SINGLE GUY, HANGING OUT WITH A COUPLE OF GUYS. AND ONE WOMAN. AND HE'S ALWAYS FOILED BY HIS NEMESIS, HELLO, JUDDAS. AND FOLKS, EVERY TIME PRESIDENT OBAMA GOES OVERSEAS HE EMBARRASSES OUR COUNTRY AND HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS TIME AT YESTERDAY'S MEMORIAL FOR NELSON PAN DELLA.
ON HIS WAY TO THE PODIUM THE PRESIDENT SHOOK HANDS WITH OTHER WORLD LEADERS INCLUDING THE CUBAN LEADER RAUL CASTRO.
OUR PRESIDENT DID SHAKE HANDS AT ONE POINT WITH RAUL CASTRO.
IT WAS THE MOMENT WE ALL STOPPED AND SAID WHOA.
YEAH.
AND THE OTHER --
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?
Stephen: WHOA! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE, BILL. THE PRESIDENT SHOOK HANDS WITH RAUL CASTRO, AND THAT IS VERY, VERY BAD BECAUSE--  (LAUGHTER) LITTLE HELP? LITTLE HELP.
JUST ONE MONTH LAST YEAR CUBA JAILED MORE THAN 1100 POLITICAL DISSIDENTS.
IT WAS NAUSEATED THAT HE SHOOK THE HAND OF A MURDERER, A THUG AN THOSE ARE BLOODIED HANDS.
WHY SHOULD YOU SHAKE HANDS WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS EP COULDING AMERICANS IN PRISON. WHAT'S THE POINT. NEVILLE CHAM ERLANE SHOOK HANDS WITH HITLERS.
THEY SAY A FRIENDLY GREETER WITH RAUL SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE.
SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE, A MESSAGE THAT WE MIGHT TALK TO THEM AGAIN. AND IS NELSON MANDELA'S MEMORIAL REALLY THE PLACE FOR RECONCILIATION? SHAKING THIS MAN'S HAND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I DO ENJOY CLAPPING. FOLKS, SHAKING THIS MAN'S HAND IS AN OVERT ENDORSEMENT OF RAUL'S BROTHER, FIDEL. AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT IS WHY FDR NEVER SHOOK HANDS WITH KEVIN HITLER. OKAY. PRETTY NICE GUY, BY THE WAY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SOLID DUDE. BUT HE WOULD HELP YOU MOVE, YOU KNOW, YOU CALL HIM UP, KEVIN, WOULD YOU HELP ME MOVE. AND WE SAY, YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER IS ADOLF HITLER. AND YOU GO YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW, BUT COULD YOU HELP ME MOVE, IT IS A FIVE STORY WALK UP. AND HE WOULD GO I'M THERE, MAN, IS THERE PIZZA. YEAH, AFTER WE MOVE THERE'S PIZZA. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PAY YOU THE PIZZA BEFORE WE MOVE, YOU KNOW, OR BOTHER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WE MOVE FIRST. AND THEN HE GOES IT'S RAINING. HE GOES NOPE, I'M THERE. THAT'S KEVIN HITLER. (APPLAUSE) BUT PERHAPS THE BIGGEST OUTRAGE OF THE DAY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, IT HAD TO DO WITH THE MAN STANDING A FOOT AWAY FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THIS IS INCREDIBLE. THE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER USED AT TUESDAY'S MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR NELSON MANDELA, RIGHT THERE ON THE STAGE, A FOOT AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BY 9 WAY, IT TURNS OUT IS BEING CALLED A FAKE BY THE DEAF FEDERATION OF SOUTH AFRICA. THEY'RE SAYING NOTHING HE IS DOING THERE IS SIGN LANGUAGE.
Stephen: COME ON, NONE OF IT WAS SIGN LANGUAGE, FROM WHERE I'M SITTING IS VERY CLEARLY SAYING-- I DON'T SPEAK HEBREW BUT MY HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE WHO DO, PLEASE HERE, HAVE SOME PIE AND REMEMBER ALWAYS WEAR YOUR SEAT BELT. (APPLAUSE) WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BEATS ME. I DON'T SPEAK HEBREW EITHER. NOW IT TURNS OUT THIS GUY HAD PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS EVENTS WHERE QUESTIONS HAD ALSO BEEN RAISED ABOUT HIS PROFICIENCY THERE TO WHICH HE FORMALLY RESPONDED,--  (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS AN OUTRAGE TO CRITICIZE THIS MAN. IN YOUR RUSH TO CALL THIS GOOD MACHINE A FRAUD DID YOU EVER STOP TO CONSIDER THAT PERHAPS HE WAS TRANSLATING FOR THE SIGN LANGUAGE IMPAIRED? ALL THE DEAF PEOPLE OUT THERE WILL JUST NEVER GOT AROUND TO USING SIGN LANGUAGE. BUT STILL WANT TO SEEM LIKE THEY'RE PARTICIPATING. I MEAN IMAGINE THEIR SENSE OF ISOLATION, THERE ARE DEAD PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND OTHER DEAF PEOPLE. BUT NOW THERE'S FINALLY SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS THEIR MADE UP LANGUAGE. I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE BRAVE MEMBERS OF THE SIGN LANGUAGE IMPAIRED COMMUNITY. I STEPHEN COLBERT, STAND WITH YOU AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME. FOR TWO LONG, FOR TWO LONG YOU HAVE HAD NO VOICE. THERE HAS BEEN NO ONE TO SPEAK FOR YOU. BUT FROM GREAT HARDSHIP COMES GREAT STRENGTH. DID MANDELA NOT TEACH US RECONCILIATION AND FORGIVENESS? SO NOW LET EVERYONE IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY JOIN HANDS IN THE SPIRIT OF BROTHERHOOD AND SAY HEY, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD BIRD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
