[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH STAR OF STAGE AND SCREEN, MR. PAUL RUDD. PAUL, I GOT TO TELL YOU, WHEN I THINK OF PAUL RUDD, THE ONE MEMORY THAT COMES TO MIND FOR ME IS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I EVER MET YOU WAS... I WAS ON THE SET OF SOMEBODY'S TV SHOW, YOU WERE THERE, MY DAUGHTER WAS THERE AT AGE SIX, AND SHE WAS BORED, AND YOU SANG, "OOPS I DID IT AGAIN" WITH HER OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO KEEP HER ENTERTAINED, AND MY WIFE AND I AGREE WITH HER, THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU THE NICEST PERSON ON THE PLANET. [AUDIENCE REACTS] IT WAS THE SWEETEST THING. [APPLAUSE]
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO SAY, BUT IN TRUTH IT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER THAT WAS ENTERTAINING ME.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? THAT'S ALSO A VERY NICE THING FOR YOU TO HAVE SAID.
LOOK, I WAS DRUNK. I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER.
Stephen: I WAS WONDERING. BECAUSE YOU OFTEN COME OFF AS NICE, AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, ARE YOU AN ASSHOLE WHO IS A GREAT ACTOR, OR ARE YOU A REALLY NICE GUY WHO IS A TERRIBLE ACTOR?
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WE'D EVER MET. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YOU'RE A GREAT ACTOR NOW, YOU'RE GETTING READY, ONE THING THAT'S GOT ME EXCITED, ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT ACTORS, ONE REASON I WISH I WAS AN ACTOR IS YOU GUYS SOMETIMES WILL GET PAID TO GET FIT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
RIGHT.
Stephen: LIKE THE ROCK WILL GET BULKED UP FOR HERCULES. YOU'RE GOING TO BE ANT MAN, MARVEL'S ANT MAN.
RIGHT.
Stephen: HAVE PEOPLE... ARE YOU LIKE GETTING JACKED BEFORE THEY SHRINK YOU DOWN? HAVE YOU HAD TO GET FIT?
I'VE HAD TO KIND OF TRY AND GET IN BETTER SHAPE. I DON'T REALLY GET TOO JACKED.
Stephen: REALLY?
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S TRYING TO BE AT ANT.
Stephen: THERE HAS TO BE THAT MOMENT WHEN IT'S HOT AND ANT MAN TAKES OFF HIS SHIRT. HE'S GOT LIKE A SIX-PACK THORAX DOWN HERE.
I'M WORKING ON MY MANDIBLES. I'M TRYING TO GET IN BETTER SHAPE. IT IS KIND OF PAR FOR THE COURSE.
Stephen: YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IN BETTER SHAPE BECAUSE YOU'RE 57 OR IS IT LIKE... DID THE STUDIO SEND LIKE A NO NONSENSE EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN TO MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL UNTIL YOU HAVE SHOULDERS?
A LITTLE OF BOTH. I THOUGHT... NORMALLY I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE MY BODY A LITTLE BIT, WORKING ON MOVIES, BUT FOR ME IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE OPPOSITE WAY. I'VE WORKED ON SEVERAL MOVIES WITH JUDD APATOW WHO INSISTS THAT I GET FATTER.
Stephen: REALLY?
HONEST TO GOD. HE SAYS I... HE HAS SAID, I WANT FAT RUDD. THAT'S HOW HE SAYS IT. I'VE HAD TO EAT CUPCAKES in "THIS IS 40" HE WANTS ME MUSHY. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES I'VE HAD TO GO THE OTHER WAY.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE DE NIRO, ONLY DOING HALF OF "RAGING BULL."
DE NIRO AND I VERY SIMILAR, IN STYLE AND APPROACH. AND WE BOTH OWN HOTELS
Stephen: I DO A DE NIRO. YOU EVER SEEN MY DE NIRO.
I HAVEN'T.
Stephen: "YEAH, SEE? I'M ROBERT DE NIRO, SEE? YEAH, SEE, I RUN THIS TOWN."
THAT'S FANTASTIC. THAT'S AMAZING.
Stephen: NOW PAUL, AT A CERTAIN POINT WE PROBABLY  SHOULD GO TO COMMERCIAL.
HEY, IT'S YOUR SHOW.
I'M NOT SURE IT IS RIGHT NOW.
THAT SEEMED AGGRESSIVE.
Stephen: THAT CAME ACROSS VERY AGGRESSIVE AND RUDE OF ME.
KIND OF A DICK. YOU'RE KIND OF REEVALUATING EVERYTHING YOU SAID ABOUT THE "OOPS I DID IT AGAIN."
Stephen: I WANT TO THANK YOU, PAUL RUDD. I THINK WE ALL WANT TO THANK PAUL RUDD FOR BEING HERE.
BY THE WAY, THE ONLY REASON I GOT THAT AGGRESSIVE, RIDDLED WITH HGH AND STEROIDS.
Stephen: YOU'RE 'ROID RAGING RIGHT NOW? COULD YOU TEAR A PHONE BOOK IN HALF?
NOT ONLY COULD I TEAR A PHONE BOOK IN HALF, I COULD GO AT LEAST 80 HOME RUNS IN A SEASON.
Stephen: ARE YOUR TESTICLES THE SIZE OF CURRANTS?
LITTLE TINY BLACK CURRANTS. THEY ARE.
Stephen: I WANTED SO MUCH FOR THIS TO BE A GOOD  EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. I DO LIKE YOU SO MUCH. YOU'RE SUCH A LOVELY GUY.
IT WAS. IT REALLY WAS. I'VE ENJOYED IT. I HOPE I HAVEN'T LET YOU DOWN.
Stephen:, NO YOU HAVEN'T, BECAUSE NONE OF THIS IS GOING ON AIR. WE'RE CUTTING ALL OF THIS OUT. IT'S ALL GONE.
IF THAT'S THE CASE, LET'S KEEP TALKING ABOUT MY TESTICLES. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: HEY, TALK IS CHEAP. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELL, WE'VE GOT TO GO. PAUL RUDD, THANK YOU SO MUCH. "THEY CAME TOGETHER." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
