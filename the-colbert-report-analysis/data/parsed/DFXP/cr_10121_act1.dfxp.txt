Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW SECRET WEAPON TO DEFEAT  HILLARY CLINTON. SHE CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT IF SHE'S  BINGE WATCHING "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK." THEN A LONGTIME G.O.P. SENATOR IS IN TROUBLE. THE RACCOON ON RAND PAUL'S HEAD WOKE UP, AND IT IS NOT HAPPY. AND MY GUEST KATTY KAY AND CLAIRE SHIPMAN BELIEVE MEN AND WOMEN'S BRAINS WORK DIFFERENTLY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT MAKES ME ANGRY. POLICE IN FRESNO, CALIFORNIA, BUSTED A METH LAB IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. THEY GOT SUSPICIOUS WHEN NO ONE THERE HAD ANY TEETH. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY. NATION, FOLKS, I HAVE GOT... I HAVE GOT SOME ENORMOUS NEWS TONIGHT, HUGE NEWS, BREAKING TODAY. IT HAS BEEN NEARLY TWO YEARS SINCE THE TRAGIC ATTACK ON OUR CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI. AND EVER SINCE THERE HAS BEEN ONLY ONE QUESTION.
WHAT IS THIS, ALMOST TWO YEARS AFTER BENGHAZI, NO ONE HAS BEEN CAPTURED, NO ONE HAS BEEN KILLED.
NONE OF THE ATTACKERS HAS BEEN ARRESTED.
THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME IN BENGHAZI HAVE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.
WHY HASN'T ANYONE BEEN ARRESTED?
YES, WE MUST BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR BENGHAZI TO JUSTICE. AND SADLY, HILLARY CLINTON REMAINS AT LARGE. [LAUGHTER] OH, WAIT, AND YESTERDAY THIS HAPPENED.
U.S. SPECIAL FORCES MOVED IN AND CAPTURED THE SO-CALLED MASTERMIND OF THE ATTACK IN BENGHAZI.
THE U.S. WAS ABLE TO CAPTURE AHMED ABU KHATTALAH, THE LEADER OF AN ISLAMIST TERROR GROUP IN LIBYA.
Stephen: YES, WE GOT OUR MAN. JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A IS WHAT THEY WANT US TO THINK. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN WHAT WE DEMANDED TO SATISFY US.
WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO BRING THIS GUY IN?
WHAT TOOK SO LONG?
FOR THOSE KEEPING TRACK, IT'S BEEN 642 DAYS.
IT TOOK 642 DAYS AFTER THE ATTACKS TO LAND ONE SUSPECT.
THIS GUY HAS BEEN DRINKING STRAWBERRY FRAPPES AND LATTES FOR 642 DAYS. WHAT'S UP?
Stephen: WHAT'S UP? WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG? KHATTALAH WAS INTERVIEWED BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SIPPING A STRAWBERRY FRAPPE ON A PATIO. THEY COULD HAVE JUST LOOKED FOR THE TERRORIST WITH THE FROSTY PINK MUSTACHE. [LAUGHTER] PRESIDENT BUSH DID NOT WAIT 642 DAYS TO CATCH BIN LADEN. IF HE COULDN'T CATCH HIM RIGHT AWAY, HE WASN'T GOING TO CATCH HIM AT ALL. THAT'S CALLED HAVING SOME PRIDE. FOLKS, WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY AS SOON AS I CAN FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S BAD. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WILL CONTINUE TO TELL YOU THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S AMBITIONS ARE NOT TIED TO THE SCANDAL IN BENGHAZI, BUT HERE'S A COINCIDENCE: I'M ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT HER. [LAUGHTER] HILLARY CLINTON, IS SHE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? WELL, DON'T ASK HER.
I HAVEN'T MADE UP MY MIND. I'M GOING TO DECIDE WHEN IT FEELS RIGHT FOR ME TO DECIDE. I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: SHE DOESN'T KNOW. ALL SHE KNOWS IS SHE'S DOING TOWN HALLS ON HER NATIONWIDE BOOK TOUR WITH A GIANT BUS THAT SAYS, "READY FOR HILLARY." IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING. [LAUGHTER] BUT IF HILLARY CLINTON DOES RUN, SHE'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT. SHE HAS NAME RECOGNITION. SHE HAS EXPERIENCE AND TWO X CHROMOSOMES, AND THAT'S REALLY GOING TO HELP IN THOSE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE WOMEN. FOLKS, I AM NOT WORRIED BECAUSE THE G.O.P. HAS A NEW WEAPON TO TAKE HER DOWN.
HILLARY CLINTON'S PRECAMPAIGN BOOK TOUR ARRIVED IN D.C. AND THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE WELCOMED HER WITH RIDICULE IN THE FORM OF A GIANT SQUIRREL ASKING CLINTON SUPPORTERS, "ANOTHER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE: ARE YOU NUTS?"
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. A GIANT SQUIRREL. BECAUSE SURE, CLINTON'S GONE TOE-TO-TOE WITH SOME OF THE TOUGHEST MEN ON THE PLANET, BUT HAS SHE EVER TAKEN ON A MAN-SIZED RODENT ARMED WITH PUNS? I THINK NUT. AND THE SQUIRREL HERE HAS BEEN GOING AFTER HILLARY WITH TWEET ZINGERS LIKE, "HILLARY CLINTON IS SQUIRRELY IF SHE THINKS THE TALIBAN AREN'T A THREAT TO US" AND "HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO HIDE HER RECORD ON BENGHAZI THE WAY I HIDE ACORNS." WOW. THOSE ARE SOME STINGING NUT PUNS. I CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE. CASHEW BELIEVE SHE'S RUNNING? HILLARY PE-CAN'T BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. WE NEED A BORDER WAL-NUT. REMEMBER, SHE MURDERED VINCE FOSTER. PISTACHIO. NATION, THIS IS THE BEST USE OF A MASCOT IN POLITICS SINCE  STEPHEN DOUGLAS DRESSED UP AS A BANANA AND SAID LINCOLN WAS  UNAPPEALING. AND THIS BRAND-NEW IDEA TO ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON  WILL DEFINITELY WORK BECAUSE IT IS ACTUALLY A BRAND-OLD IDEA TO ATTACK OBAMA THAT DID NOT WORK. YOU SEE, BACK IN 2008, TO SHOWCASE OBAMA'S INVOLVEMENT WITH ACORN, THE SQUIRREL MADE APPEARANCES WAVING BEHIND CHRIS MATTHEWS ON MSNBC AND DANCING AT DEMOCRATIC PRESS CONFERENCES IN OHIO BEFORE BEING KICKED OUT BY THE POLICE. EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED, ESPECIALLY HIS FRIEND, THE CHIPMUNK. AND YET SIX YEARS LATER, THERE ARE STILL A FEW DETAILS ABOUT THE SQUIRREL THEY HAVEN'T WORKED OUT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NAME OF THE SQUIRREL IS STILL TBD. FOLKS, I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT REPUBLICANS WILL COME UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY FUNNY LIKE THEY DID WITH REINCE PREIBUS. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THIS SQUIRREL HAS BEEN FOLLOWING CLINTON FOR A WEEK, AND A SPOKESMAN FOR THE RNC PROMISES THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT FOR AS LONG AS IT WORKS. AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR WHENEVER THAT STARTS. BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE SQUIRREL WAS THE VICTIM OF A SNEAK ATTACK.
HELLO, MR. SQUIRREL. HOW ARE YOU? I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME AROUND. WHILE YOU'RE IN BETWEEN YOUR GIGS, I WANTED YOU TO GET A COPY OF MY BOOK. I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE THE HARD CHOICE AND READ MY BOOK. BUT YOU BRING A SMILE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE'S FACES. THANK YOU, MR. SQUIRREL. [APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SHE MADE FRIENDS WITH HIM. HE WAS SO RATTLED THAT HE LATER TWEETED, "THANK YOU, HILLARY CLINTON. I LOVE FICTION." COME ON, SQUIRREL. YEAH, THAT'S A DIG AT HILLARY, BUT THERE'S NOT ONE NUT PUN IN THERE. WHAT ABOUT, "THANKS, HILLARY, BUT IF I WANTED TO READ A LOT OF BOOKS, I WOULD HAVE ENTERED MACADAMIA." OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY HILLARY'S JUST TOO TOUGH TO BE TAKEN DOWN BY ONE RECYCLED MASCOT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT LEAST TWO RECYCLED MASCOTS. SO TONIGHT IN SUPPORT OF THE RNC, I AM RE-PURPOSING THE COLBERT REPORT'S OLD MASCOT, McGNAW THE GLUTEN-FREE BEAVER. COME ON IN, McGNAW.
HI. HI, EVERYBODY! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: McGNAW, McGNAW, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK, BUDDY.
MY PLEASURE, STEPHEN. THIS BEAVER IS EAGER TO DO IT. YAY! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: NOW PREVIOUSLY YOU'VE EDUCATED KIDS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GLUTEN AND CELIAC DISEASE.
YEP, KIDS, LISTEN TO YOUR FRIEND McGNAW, DON'T EAT BREAD, EAT WOOD INSTEAD.
Stephen: RIGHT, THOUGH KIDS, TO BE CLEAR, IN THIS EXAMPLE, WOOD IS A METAPHOR FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
OR WOOD.
Stephen: LET'S MOVE ON. McGNAW, ARE YOU PREPARED TO JOIN MR. SQUIRREL AND TAKE ON HILLARY CLINTON?
YOU BET. I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HER DECISION TO VOTE FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ.
Stephen: LIKE?
LIKE WHY DID SHE VOTE FOR IT.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO PEPPER THAT WITH SOME BEAVER PUNS.
LIKE WHAT?
Stephen: LIKE IF SHE HAD TO DO IT OVER, "WOOD" SHE "CHEWS" TO DO IT AGAIN? HUH? [APPLAUSE]
I DON'T KNOW, STEPHEN. THAT DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE FOR THE GRAVITY OF THIS SUBJECT. I WAS READING AN ARTICLE IN "PRO-PUBLICA," AND I'M TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T EVEN READ THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE BEFORE VOTING TO COMMIT TROOPS TO AN OPEN-ENDED CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
Stephen: "DAM." THAT'S A SCARY "TAIL," BEAVER.
WHY AM I HERE, IS IT BECAUSE I'M A BEAVER YOU ALREADY HAD  ON STAFF OR DO YOU REALLY WANT SOME ANSWERS.
Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WON'T DO ANY BEAVER PUNS.
THE PUNS ARE FOR KIDS. YOU'RE ASKING ME TO ASK QUESTIONS TO AN ADULT WOMAN WHO CAN ASCEND TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND. I THINK PUNS ARE A LITTLE BENEATH MY DIGNITY AS A JOURNALIST, AND THEY SHOULD BE BENEATH YOUR DIGNITY, TOO. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Stephen: NO, NO, NO. HE'S RIGHT. I'M SORRY, McGNAW. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU.
WELL, I'M NOT JUST A ONE-TRICK BEAVER. I'M TRYING TO BRANCH OUT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: LIKE A TREE BRANCH?
ALL RIGHT, [BLEEPED] YOU, MAN, [BLEEPED] YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: McGNAW, THE GLUTEN-FREE BEAVER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. McGNAW, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
