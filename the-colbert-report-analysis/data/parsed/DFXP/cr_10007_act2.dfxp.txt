Stephen: (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH! FOLKS, YOU KNOW THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE OVER A YEAR AWAY BUT CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING FOR JOBS IN A GOVERNMENT THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS IS A SAD TIME FOR ME BECAUSE MY FAVORITE REPRESENTATIVE MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN AND PIANO TEACHER WHO SITS TO CLOSE TO YOU MICHELE BACHMANN -- (LAUGHTER). -- IS NOT RUNNING FOR REELECTION. (AUDIENCE REACTS) SHE WILL BE MISSED, I KNOW, SHE'S A TRUE CONSERVATIVE WITH A VISION OF OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE. OR POSSIBLE OF A COAT RACK OR A BIRD. I COULD NEVER TELL WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT. FORTUNATELY, FOLKS, THERE'S A CANDIDATE OUT THERE FOR HER SEAT WHO MAY BE ABLE TO FILL HER SHOES. TOM EMMER. HE'S PRO-LIFE, PRO-FAMILY, PROSTATE'S RIGHTS AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS AD, DEFINITELY PRO-BUSINESS.
WHEN THE STORM SETTLES, THERE'S ONLY ONE CLEAR CHOICE. INTEGRITY EXTERIORS AND REMODELERS.
MY NAME IS TOM EMMER AND I'M RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN MINNESOTA'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO DO REMODELING, SIDING, OR GENERAL CONSTRUCTION, RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL, I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT QUALIFICATION YOU NEED TO CALL THE FOLKS AT INTEGRITY EXTERIORS AND REMODELERS. THEY'RE THE BEST.
Stephen: WOW! (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOM EMMER'S PLATFORM IS BUT I KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BUILD IT. (LAUGHTER) NOW WHY -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OF COMBINING ADS FOR POLITICIANS WITH COMMERCIAL ENDORSEMENTS YEARS AGO? POSSIBLY BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF EXTREMELY ILLEGAL. (LAUGHTER) ACCORDING TO THE CAMPAIGN LEGAL CENTER, A COMMERCIAL THAT RUNS AS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT ON TELEVISION WILL BE A CLEAR VIOLATION OF FEDERAL ELECTION LAW AND ILLEGAL CORPORATE IN-KIND CONTRIBUTION TO A CANDIDATE FOR A FEDERAL OFFICE IN THE FORM OF A COORDINATED AD. COORDINATED? I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) FIRST OF ALL, HE'S NOT TELLING YOU TO VOTE FOR HIM. HE'S JUST TELLING YOU TO CALL INTEGRITY REMODELERS.
YOU NEED TO CALL THE FOLKS WITH INTEGRITY EXTERIORS AND REMODELERS.
Stephen: AND THEN HE NEVER GIVES YOU THE PHONE NUMBER. (LAUGHTER) DOES THAT SOUND COORDINATED TO YOU? AND, FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS SO-CALLED CONTROVERSY IS CLEARLY JUST ANOTHER CONSPIRACY BY BIG LIBERAL MEDIA. THIS TIME IN THE FORM OF SMALL-TOWN MINNESOTA BLOGGER SALLY JO SORENSEN WHO SPOTTED THE AD DURING A LOCAL BACKYARD WRESTLING SHOW CALLED "SUNDAY SHOCK WAVE." (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE BACKYARD WRESTLING AND YOUR HEAD IS DRIVEN THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, THERE IS NO BETTER COMPANY TO FIX IT THAN INTEGRITY EXTERIORS AND REMODELING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BESIDES, EMMER'S CAMPAIGN HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION SAYING IT WAS NOT TOM'S INTENTION FOR THIS TESTIMONIAL TO BE USED IN A BROADCAST CAPACITY OR ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE CAMPAIGN. YES, HE WAS JUST INNOCENTLY STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA UNDER THE LIGHTS WEARING A MICROPHONE THINKING HE WAS DOING SOMETHING MORE REPUTABLE, LIKE PORN! UNINTENTIONAL ADVERTISING HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. IN FACT, I REMEMBER THIS ONE TIME --
HEY, MR. COLBERT.
Stephen: HEY, BRENDAN, NOW WAS THE BIG GAME?
NOT SO GOOD, MR. COLBERT, I KIND OF RAN OUT OF ENERGY.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO DRINK SOME MORE SUNNY D. (LAUGHTER) SUNNY D IS PACKED WITH VITAMINS AND MINERALS AND THE BOLD INTENSE TASTE KIDS JUST LOVE.
RADICAL!
Stephen: HEY, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DRINKS SUNNY D? NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CHRIS?
EVERYDAY I HOPE YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE BEING THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED. (LAUGHTER)
I LOVE YOU, MR. COLBERT.
Stephen: I KNOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO HATS OFF TO MR. TOM EMMER FOR SHOWING US A BRAND NEW WAY TO CROSS-PROMOTE CANDIDATES AND PRODUCTS. THANKS TO THIS AD, I WILL FOREVER ASSOCIATE YOUR CAMPAIGN WITH THINGS THAT NEED MAJOR RENOVATION. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
