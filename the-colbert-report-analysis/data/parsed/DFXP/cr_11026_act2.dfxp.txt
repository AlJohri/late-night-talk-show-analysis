Stephen: WELCOME BACK, NATION. FOLKS YOU CANNOT SPELL JUDGMENT WITHOUT "U" APPEARING BEFORE "ME." THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER! FIRST UP ON THE TIP WAGS, THERE IS A LOT OF HUNGER IN AMERICA. IN 2012, MORE THAN ONE IN SEVEN U.S. HOUSE HOLDS EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY. THAT MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL WILL COME FROM. AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. JUST LAST NIGHT, I COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO ORDER ITALIAN OR CHINESE. SO I SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND ORDERED AZERBAIJANI FOOD. OF COURSE, BY THE TIME I GOT IT, MY TOYUG PLOV WAS SUPER-DRY. SO, YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT THERE. AND THOUGH I SUPPORT CONGRESS' $800 MILLION CUT TO OUR FOOD STAMP PROGRAM THAT OBAMA SIGNED THIS YEAR, I'M NO MONSTER. I WOULDN'T WANT ANY LEGITIMATELY HUNGRY PERSON TO STARVE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO SOCIETY'S TRULY UNDERPRIVILEGED -- YOUR LOVEABLE SHOE SHINE BOYS, YOUR PHOTOGENIC WAIFS, YOUR PIE-CRAZED HOBOS. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY TO LEARN ABOUT A TREND THAT'S TURNING ONE MAN'S TRASH INTO ANOTHER MAN'S EDIBLE TRASH.
SALVAGE STORES LIKE THIS ONE SPECIALIZE IN SELLING EXPIRED FOODS AT GREATLY REDUCED PRICES. 75% OF THE GROCERY ITEMS SOLD HERE HAVE "BEST BY" OR "USED BY" DATES THAT HAVE ALREADY EXPIRED. DAMAGED, DENTED, DATED OR DISCOUNTED PRODUCTS THAT GROCERY STORES WON'T SELL, LETTING CONSUMERS GET CUH-RAZY DISCOUNTS.
Stephen: YES, CUH-RAZY DISCOUNTS, SO POOR FAMILIES CAN GET SUH-HUBSISTENCE NUTRITION. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO SALVAGE STORES FOR SHOWING THE "LEAST" WE CAN DO FOR THE HUNGRY IS LESS THAN ANY OF US THOUGHT. SURE, IT MIGHT SEEM SAD TO EAT THINGS THAT ARE EXPIRED OR DAMAGED, BUT THIS IS AMERICA -- IF YOU WORK HARD AND PLAY BY THE RULES, YOU WILL EVENTUALLY EARN THE DIGNITY OF AN INTACT BOX OF TRISCUITS. AND DON'T THINK OF IT AS EATING DISCARDED FOOD. THOSE SPAGHETTIOS ARE JUST BEING SERVED AL-DENTED. THEY'RE PERFECTLY "PROBABLY" SAFE. SO YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA'S HUNGRY. BECAUSE THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT'S GONNA GET. WE JUST VOTED IN THE PEOPLE WHO WANT "MORE" CUTS. TO THESE GUYS, EXPIRED PRUNES ISN'T A QUESTIONABLE FOOD PRODUCT -- IT'S THEIR VOTER BASE. NEXT UP, NATION, YOU WILL RECALL THAT LAST NIGHT I FINALLY MADE MY PEACE WITH BEAR KIND BY GETTING ME A PIECE OF BEAR KIND. HE TASTED LIKE PEPPERMINT AND OLD SALMON. SO I WAS SADDENED TO HEAR THAT VOTERS IN MAINE HAVE PASSED A BALLOT INITIATIVE PRESERVING THEIR RIGHT TO HUNT BLACK BEARS WITH DAY-OLD JELLY DOUGHNUT, CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES, TWINKIES AND WHITE BREAD. THAT'S RIGHT. IN MAINE, YOU CAN HUNT BEARS USING EXPIRED TWINKIES. THOUGH IT MEANS YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT 300 YEARS. FOLKS, THIS IS DEPLORABLE AND CRUEL TO MY NEW BEAR FRIENDS. IF YOU LURE A BEAR WITH A BEAR CLAW,  YOU'RE TEMPTING HIM INTO CANNIBALISM! SO I'M GIVING A BIG WAG OF MY FINGER TO MAINE FOR ALLOWING THE HUNTERS TO KILL BEARS USING JUNK FOOD. BEWARE BEARS! ASK NOT FOR WHOM THE DING DONGS, IT DONGS FOR THEE. BESIDES, I JUST LEARNED THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO COULD USE THAT FOOD. FORGET GOING TO THE SALVAGE STORES,  HUNGRY AMERICANS. MAINE'S JUST GIVING AWAY JELLY DONUTS IN  THE WOODS! AND IF YOU GET CAUGHT IN A BEAR TRAP WHILE FORAGING  FOR STALE PASTRY, THAT'S JUST GOOD -- YOU CAN GNAW OFF YOUR OWN LEG. THAT IS SOME DELICIOUS DOUGHNUT-FED MEAT. AND HERE'S A BONUS -- YOU WON'T GAIN AN OUNCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
