Stephen:  WELL, FOLKS,  THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT'S LIVE  REPORT. I JUST WANT TO SAY BEFORE WE GO,  WHETHER YOU VIDEOED FOR BARACK  OBAMA OR -- VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA OR MITT ROMNEY TOMORROW  SOME OF YOU WILL BE ELATED AND  SOME OF YOU WILL BE CRUSHED. FOR SOME IT WILL BE LIKE  CHRISTMAS MORNING, FOR OTHERS  THE FIFTH NIGHT OF HANUKKAH. [LAUGHTER] OR SO MY WRITERS TELL ME. SO WHAT NOW? [LAUGHTER] WHERE FROM HERE? THE GAME IS OVER AND THE  WHISTLE'S BLOWN. BUT WE ALL LINE UP AND SHAKE  HANDS AND IF SO DID DEBRA'S MOM  REMEMBER THE ORANGE SLICES. WITH THE ELECTION OVER, DO WE  LANCE THE BOIL OF HYPER  PARTISANSHIP ONCE AND FOR ALL AND BEGIN TO HEAL OR DO WE LET  IT CALLOUS OVER INTO AN ABSCESS,  SAVED BY THE PUSS OF THE MEDIA WHO THRIVE ON AN ATMOSPHERE OF  PETTY SQUABBLING AND PERSONAL  VISIT RECALL. THAT'S A HIGH PRICE TO PAY FOR  MOMENTARY POLITICAL GAMES. I FOR ONE AM MORE THAN WILLING  TO HAVE YOU PAY IT. [LAUGHTER] SO IF YOUR GUY WON, WHEN YOU  PULL INTO WORK TOMORROW, JUST  TAKE A MOMENT AND HAVE A FEW DOUGHNUTS IN THE PARKING LOT. THEN IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, STRIDE  INTO WORK, SPORT YOUR THROBBING  VICTORY WOOD. DON'T WAVE IT IN EVERYBODY'S  FACE. OR IF YOU DO WAVE IT, BE  CONSIDERATE AND HANG AN AIR  RESHENER ON IT.F  MEANWHILE IF YOUR GUY LOST, BITE YOUR TONGUE, FOCUS ON YOUR WORK  AND THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET,  YOU PUNCH THAT A-HOLE RIGHT IN THE AIR FRESHENER AND YOU SAY  SEE YOU IN 2016. GOOD NIGHT AMERICA. [CROWD CHEERING] GOD BLESS YOU ALL.  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBH   access.wgbh.org
