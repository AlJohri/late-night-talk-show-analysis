THIS SHOW IS REALLY ABOUT YOU. I AM BUT YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT. AND, FOLKS, IT IS NICE FOR OUR  ROYAL BABY COVERAGE AND WE CAN  NOW REPORT OFFICIALLY-- I'VE BEEN TOLD WE CAN REPORT  OFFICIALLY HIS ROYAL HYANNIS  PRINCE GEORGE OF CAMBRIDGE UMBILICAL STUMP HAS DRIED UP AND  WILL FLAKE OFF IN THREE TO 10  DAYS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PICTURE OF  IT. THERE YOU HAVE IT. YUP, YEAH. DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. THAT SHOULD BE COMING OFF PRETTY  SOON. OF COURSE, FOLKS, WE ALL  REMEMBER HOW WE FIRST LEARNED  THE JOYOUS NEWS.
THE FIRST BORN OF THE ROYAL  HYANNIS, THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF  CAMBRIDGE. THE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE  THRONE. MAY HE BE LONG LIVED, HAPPY, AND  GLORIOUS, AND ONE DAY REIGN OVER  US. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
Stephen: YES, LONDON'S  OFFICIAL TOWN CRIER WAS  EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT, OTHER THAN INTELLIGIBLE. THE ONLY WAY HE COULD HAVE BEEN  BETTER IS IF HE WERE REAL.
THE GUY WHO BECAME THE FACE  AND THE VOICE OF THE ROYAL BABY  ANNOUNCEMENT APPEARS TO BE A  FAKE. A PARTY CRASHER. WHEN THE TOWN CRIER STEPPED UP  TO ANNOUNCE THE BIRTH OF THE  FUTURE KING, EVERYONE LISTENED, ASSUMING IT WAS PART OF THE PAG  PAGEANTRY OF THE BIRTH OF THE  FUTURE KING. TURNS OUT, HE WAS NOT INVITED BY  THE ROYAL FAMILY. IN FACT, HE'S NOT EVEN A  LONDONER.
Stephen: SHE WAS A FAKE  TOWN CRIER. I MEAN, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HIS  HAT FEATURED A CODE OF ARM WITH  A LION AND UNICORN WHEN THE NATIONAL COAT OF ARMS OF LONDON  IS TWO DRAGONS. ALSO, THE BACK OF HIS JACKET HAD  "LONG JUNE SILVER'S."  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) IT TURNS OUT, THE TOWN CRIER IS  JUST A ROYAL LOVER NAMED TONY  APPLETON, WHO IS AVAILABLE AS A MASTER OF CEREMONIESES AT  WEDDINGS, BIRTHDAYS, AND BAR  MITZVAHS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HEAR YE! HEAR YE! HEAR YE! HEAR YE! HEAR YE! HEAR YE! HEAR YE! MAZEL, MAZEL. LET IT BE KNOWN THAT AARON COHEN  HAS GONE FROM BOY TO MAN. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW LET'S GET IT STARTED IN HERE  WITH YONKERS PREMIERE HIP-HOP  COVER BAND THE BLACK EYED PEAS. GOD SAVE THE WHOLE MESHPUKA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( BELL RINGING )  BUT HERE'S THE THING, FOLKS, IF  THIS GUY IS NOT REAL, THEN I CAN'T TRUST ANY OF IT. THE WHOLE ROYAL FAMILY COULD BE  A SCAM! I MEAN, THEY DON'T DO A DAMN  THING. WHY SHOULD WE CARE? IN FACT,UN WHAT, JIMMY? I HAVE A SUSPICION-- PUT UP THE  PHOTO OF WILAND KATE AND ZOOM  IN. ( LAUGHTER )
BOOYAKASHA.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF  INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE OUTLIVED  THEIR USEFULNESS-- DETROIT.
NOW DETROIT HAS FALLEN ON  SUCH HARD TIMES THE CITY IS  FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY, BECOMING THE LARGEST U.S. CITY TO DO SO
MOVE IS UNPRECEDENTED. THE BIGGEST MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCY  IN AMERICAN HISTORY. A MAJOR U.S. CITY OFFICIALLY  DECLARING IT CANNOT PAY ITS DEBT  ESTIMATED AT $18 BILLION.
Stephen: $18 BILLION! AND DETROIT BORROWED THOSE  BILLIONS FROM SOME PRETTY  SERIOUS PEOPLE. IF THEY DON'T GET PAID, THEY'VE  THRENTED TO CUT OFF MICHIGAN'S  THUMB. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, IT TURNS OUT, ROBO COP WAS  AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF DETROIT'S  FUTURE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS TELL THE STORY. THE CITY'S POPULATION HAS  DWIBDLE TWD 2 MILLION TO  700,000. DETROIT HAS THE HIGHEST  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE NATION,  AND AT 73,000 ABANDONED  BUILDINGS. KNOWING HOW FAR THE CITY HAS  FALLEN WOULD HAVE HENRY FORD  ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE AND SOMEHOW BLAMING THE JEWS FOR IT. NOTICE, THERE ARE A LOT OF  THEORIES OUT THERE, ABOUT WHAT  CAUSED DETROIT'S DECLINE-- MANUFACTURING JOBS GOING  OVERSEAS. CORRUPT POLITICIANS. BUT THE EASIEST EXPLANATION FOR  DETROIT'S DECLINE IS IT'S ALL  THE UNIONS' FAULT.
YOU HAVE ALL THESE PENSIONS  AND YOU HAVE ALL THIS DEBT, AND  NOW IT'S JUST TAKING THEM DOWN.
THERE WAS OVER-GENEROUS  PENSIONS AND BENEFITS.
LAVISH PENSIONS.
LAVISH PENSIONS.
Stephen: YES, LAVISH  PENSIONS, ON AVERAGE $19,000 A  YEAR, WHICH DETROIT NOW SAYS THEY WILL PAY 10 CENTS ON THE  DOLLAR. BUT RETIREES, IF YOU BUDGET  RIGHT, YOU CAN AFFORD EVERYTHING  YOU NEED IN DETROIT-- FOOD, RENT, A CUE BALL AND A SOCK TO  FIGHT OFF HUNGRY RACCOONS. LUCKILY, LUCKILY, THERE IS A  GREAT IDEA OUT THERE ON HOW TO  PAY DETROIT'S CREDITORS.
THE TREASURERS OF THE DETROIT  INSTITUTES OF ART COULD BE IN  DANGER.
KEVYN ORR HAS WARNED THE  D.I.A. IT'S HUGE COLLECTION  COULD END UP ON THE AUCTION  BLOCK.
THEY HAVE VAN GOGH, MATISSE,  AND DIEGO RIVERA, WHICH IS  IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS COMMISSIONED BY FORD HIMSELF.
THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PAWN  DETROIT'S MURALS DEPICTING A  SOCIALIST WORKERS' PARADISE. IN FACT, THEY HAVE RECEIVED A  GENEROUS OFFER FROM THE MUSEUM  OF IRONY. IRONY. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART  ALSO OWNS A COPY OF RODIN'S "THE  THINKER" AND I MIGHT PUT IN A BIT BOYD THAT BECAUSE I NEED  SOMETHING TO KEEP ME COMPANY  WHEN I'M ON THE THINKING CHAIR. SO, FOR AS WHERE DETROIT GOES  FROM HERE. WHO KNOWS? THIS GUY DOES. PLEASE WELCOME WILL EDITORIAL  PAGE EDITOR OF THE "DETROIT FREE  PRESS," STEPHEN HENDERSON. MR. HENDERSON, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE? WHAT'S THAT?
BEFORE WE GET STARTED, YOU'VE  BEEN PRETTY HARD ON US IN  DETROIT.
Stephen: I'VE BEEN PRETTY  HONEST.
WE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET OUT  OF THIS. SO I BROUGHT YOU TH T-SHIRT THAT  SUMS UP OUR ATTITUDE ABOUT THE  WHOLE WORLD.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, I'LL  TAKE THAT.
MADE BY A DETROIT VENDOR,  AVAILABLE IN DETROIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I NOTICE THIS IS A  HOODIE. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME KILLED?
WELL, I THINK-- I THINK IT  WILL BE GOOD IF YOU DON'T AWARE  IT IN FLORIDA.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS TO  DETROIT FROM HERE? DO YOU GUYS FULL OUT?
ABSOLUTELY. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THEY  TEACH YOU WHEN YOU'RE BORN IN  DETROIT-- AS IEFS IS HOW TO TAKE A PUNCH, GO DOWN, GET UP, BRUSH  YOURSELF OFF, AND SAY I'M STILL  HERE. IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS  THEY TEACH JEW THAT'S ONE OF THE  FIRST THINGS. IT'S A TOUGH PLACE.
Stephen: IS PUNCH BABIES IN  DETROIT OUT OF LOVE.
SHAMEFUL BUT TRUE GLEEL OKAY,  $18 BILLION, THAT'S HOW FAR  YOU'RE DOWN. BILL GATES IS WORTH $72 BILLION. HE COULD ENEMY IN THERE, WAVE A  MAGIC WAND, YOU HAVE GUYS  THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING MALARIA? ( LAUGHTER )  IT CAN'T BE THAT FAR OFF. IT CAN'T BE THAT FAR OFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE MAYOR  ABOUT THAT, BUT I WILL SUGGEST  IT.
Stephen: OKAY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK  WE'RE VERY DESERVING OF SOME  SORT OF HELP OF SOME KIND. THIS IS--
Stephen: BUT WE ALREADY  BAILED OUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY. HOW MUCH MORE BAILOUT DOES  DETROIT NEED?
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY. DETROIT WAS THE ARSENAL OF  DEMOCRACY IN THE 1940s DURING  WORLD WAR II. WE WITH THE THE TANKS AND PLANES  THAT MAKE SHEER YOU DON'T SPEAK  WITH A GERMAN ACCENT.
Stephen: AND WE THANKED YOU  FOR THAT BY GIVING YOU MOTOWN.
ACTUALLY, I THINK-- I THINK  WE GAVE MOTOWN TO THE WORLD.
Stephen: WHATEVER.
BUT WHATEVER. DETAILS, RIGHT.
Stephen: YEAH. WHAT CAN DETROIT DO TO PULL  ITSELF UP BY ITS OWN BOOTSTRAPS  BEFORE WE GIVE IT A BAILOUT? DOESN'T DETROIT HAVE TO MAKE AN  EFFORT? WHAT ABOUT SELLING THE ART FROM  THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART? THAT-- THAT WAS BOUGHT WHEN YOU  GIERPZ THE FOURTH LARGEST CITY. YOU DON'T NEED THAT MUCH CULTURE  ANYMORE.
RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE  D.I.A. THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IT'S  LIKE A PARK OR LIKE ANOTHER PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTE OF THE CITY. SELLING IT WOULD PREVENT THE  CITY FROM BEING THE GREAT PLACE  THAT IT COULD BE--
Stephen: YOU CAN KEEP THE  BUILDING. JUST SELL OFF WHAT'S INSIDE OF  IT, YOU KNOW.
I SHOULD ADMIT THAT MY WIFE  IS THE MARKETING DIRECTORT  MUSEUM.
Stephen: ANOTHER DOES SHE  HAVE AN INSIDE SCOOP--
IF YOU REALLY ARE INTERESTED  IN ART, I PROBABLY COULD GET  YOU--
Stephen: YOU PUT THIS DOWN  ON A PICASSO.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. MAYBE A LADY, SOMETHING WITH AN  EVEN NUMBER OF BREASTS, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT TURNING  IN ALL OF DETROIT INTO SORT OF A  WILLIAMSBURG, BECAUSE MANUFACTURING SEEMS TO BE  LEAVING THE UNITED STATES.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU KNOW,  WILLIAMSBURG HOLDS ON TO A  LITTLE TIME CAPSULE OF AN AGRARIAN SOCIETY. WHAT IF DETROIT BECAME A TIME  CAPSULE OF AN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY  AND PEOPLE COULD COME THERE AND SAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE US  WELD A BUICK?
THAT'S ONLY IF YOU BELIEVE  THAT MANUFACTURING IS ONLY PART  OF OUR PAST. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE-- AND MOST  PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IT'S  PART OF OUR FUTURE, TOO. THE AUTO COMPANIES AFTER THEIR  BAILOUT ARE BACK TO 15.5 MILLION  UNITS A YEAR SELLING. WE ARE REBUILDING MANUFACTURING  IN DETROIT. WHAT WE NEED IS CONSISTENT  POLICY FROM WASHINGTON,  CONSISTENT POLICY FROM OUR STATE CAPITAL IN LANSING. WE NEED PEOPLE TO SUPPORT US  INSTEAD OF TURNING THEIR BACK ON  US.
Stephen: YOU LIVE IN  DETROIT AND ALSO WORK IN THE  NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. ARE YOU A GLUTTON FOR  PUNISHMENT? ( LAUGHTER )
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT. I CAME BACK TO DETROIT FROM  WASHINGTON SIX YEARS AGO. AND PEOPLE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I  WAS INSANE. BUT IT'S MY HOME.
Stephen: AND MAYBE YOU  WANTED TO LIVE SOMEPLACE LESS  CORRUPT.
A LITTLE LESS CORRUPT. IT'S MY HOME. IT'S A PLACE THAT PRODUCED ME. IT PRODUCE AID LOT OF PEOPLE I  KNOW MAKING GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS  IN THE CITY AND IN THE COUNTRY. I WANTED TO RAISE MY KIDS THERE  AND I'LL STICK BY THAT.
Stephen: WELL, GOOD LUCK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). UNTIL THIS THING BLOWS OVER, WHY  DON'T YOU CALL CHICAGO AND ASK  IF ALL OF DETROIT CAN CRASH ON THEIR COUCH.
WELL, WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO  THAT.
Stephen: STEPHEN HENDERSON  FROM THE "DETROIT FREE PRESS."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
