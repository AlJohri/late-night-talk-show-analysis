Stephen: TONIGHT I UNLEASH MY ANGER ON AMAZON EXCEPT I CHOSE FREE SHIPPING SO I ACTUALLY UNLEASHED IT IN 3 TO 5 BUSINESS DAYS. (LAUGHTER) THEN A DOPING SCANDAL IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS. THE WINNER OF THE KENTUCKY DERBY TESTED POSITIVE FOR HORSE. AND MY GUEST NANCY PELOSI HAS A NEW PLAN TO SAVE THE MIDDLE CLASS. OH PERFECT, I THINK HE WATCHES MY SHOW. THE WORLD'S SECOND RICHEST MAN SAYS WE SHOULD HAVE A THREE DAY WORKWEEK. NOW YOU KNOW WHY HE'S ONLY THE SECOND RICHEST MAN. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. NATION, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. BUT OF COURSE, OF COURSE FOLKS I HAVE TO START TONIGHT WITH A SHOCKING INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT THAT HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF EVERY NATION. LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO TONIGHT'S EDITION OF WORLD NEWS WRAP-UP.
THE STORY IS STILL UNFOLDING BUT PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRINCE GEORGE IS WALKING. IT'S MAGICAL TO SEE HIS ROYAL CUTENESS TAKE HIS HISTORIC FIRST TODDLE. AND WHAT A RELIEF TO KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL BLOOD LINE STILL HAVE THE BONE DENSITY TO STAND UPRIGHT. FOLKS THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS GREAT. I DON'T HAVE A COPY OF IT HERE. NO, THIS IS GREAT. AND WE'RE ALL SMILING. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS HAPPY. AND I BELIEVE THAT CONCLUDES WORLD NEWS WRAP-UP. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THERE ARE NOT ANY OTHER BIG INTERNATIONAL STORIES, RIGHT, JIM.
THE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE BROUGHT DOWN A MALAYSIAN AIRLINES JETLINER OVER THE WAR ZONE IN EASTERN UKRAINE.
SOME CALLING IT AN ACT OF TERROR ALREADY, AND OTHERS AN ACT OF WAR.
Stephen: RIGHT, YEAH, OKAY. BUT THAT WAS THURSDAY. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT AN ATROCITY THAT COULD SPIRAL INTO WORLD WAR III WOULD HAVE WORKED ITSELF OUT OVER THE WEEKEND. EVIDENTLY NOT. NATION THIS IS AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY. AND I HOPE TONIGHT TO COVER IT WITH THE SAME TASTEFUL RESTRAINT SHOWN BY FOX NEWS'S ANIMATED SMOKING WRECKAGE GRAPHIC. IT TOOK REAL SELF CONTROL NOT TO USE THE FOX NFL SUNDAY ROBOT. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT MEANS HE'S ON ASSIGNMENT COVERING GAZA. NOW FOLKS, IT'S CLEAR THE PLANE WAS TAKEN DOWN BY A RUSSIAN SA-11 MISSILE AND THERE ARE MANY THEORIES ABOUT WHERE THESE RUSSIAN-MADE MISSILES CAME FROM. ONE THEORY IS THEY CAME FROM RUSSIA. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. OKAY. YOU GOT THESE PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS IN EASTERN UKRAINE LEAD BY FORMER RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND STAR OF BRIDGE ON THE RIVER CRAZY IGOR  GERKIN, HE ALSO GOES BY THE NOM DE DOUCHE IGOR STRELKOV WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN YOUR NAME IS GERKIN EVERYONE IS ALWAYS SAYING HEY ARE YOU JERKIN THE GERKIN, BUT IGOR STRELKOV WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THAT. I GO STROKEOFF? YES, I WOULD DO THAT. AND STROKEOFF HERE--  (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) AND STROKE-OFF IS OLD SECRET POLICE PALS OF VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO GAVE HIM A BUNCH OF SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES DESPITE THE FACT STROKEY COMMANDS A GROUP OF REBELS WHO HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS A MOTLEY BAND OF FIGHTERS WHO ARE A DRUNKIN PATCHWORK GROUP THAT IS BEYOND THE MORAL BOUNDARIES. IN OTHER WORDS, VLADIMIR PUTIN ESSENTIALLY ARMED THE JUGALOS. AND IF THIS STORY WERE NOT TRAGIC ENOUGH, AMONG THE VICTIMS WERE SIX PEOPLE HEADED TO THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE. HIV RESEARCHER NORBERT BROCKMEYER SAID THE NORMALLY CHEERFUL MOOD AT THE AIDS CONFERENCES WILL NOW BE ABSENT. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT, THESE BASTARDS HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE AIDS DEPRESSING. (LAUGHTER) JIMMY, I'M SORRY, THIS IS TOO MUCH. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SHOT OF GEORGE AGAIN PLEASE/
OH, LOOK AT HIM. HE HAS LITTLE SKINNY ROYAL OVERALLS. LOOK AT THAT ADORABLE LITTLE BOTTOM. AND THE BABY IS CUTE TOO. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
OKAY, BACK TO THE SAD MINES. THIS IS AN OBSCENE AND VIOLENT SITUATION INVOLVING WARRING GROUPS IN LAWLESS  FOREIGN TERRITORIES AND ONE TYRANT BEARS THE BLAME. BARACK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)
SENATOR, THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK THERE. SPECIFICALLY REGARD TO RUSSIA. THIS CRISIS OVER THE DOWNING OF THE MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT. WHAT DID SECRETARY KERRY NOT SAY? WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION NOT YET PREPARED TO DO THAT YOU THINK MUST BE DONE?
ONE, HE DIDN'T CALL PUTIN THE THUG THAT HE IS.
Stephen: HERE HERE. THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST CALLED PUTIN A THUG. SO ONCE AGAIN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT FALLS TO ME TO PREVENT FURTHER INTERNATIONAL CRISES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, YOU ARE A JERK, SIR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU-- YOU-- I'M SORRY, I GOT TO SAY IT. YOU-- YOU ARE A STUPID POOPY FACE. JIMMY, WHAT'S THE REACTION IN THE UKRAINE. AND YES, THE RUSSIANS ARE PULLING OUT OF DONETSK. YOU'RE WELCOME, WORLD. I HAD TO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I HAD TO. FOLKS, THAT WASN'T EASY FOR ME TO DO. I HAVE LONG BEEN ONE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN'S BIGGEST FANS. IN 2008 I SUPPORTED HIM FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I DEFENDED HIM AGAINST PUSSY RIOT PLUS ALL THOSE FAMOUS SHIRTLESS HUNTING PHOTOS, GUESS WHO TOOK THOSE. (LAUGHTER) I GUESS I'LL BE TAKING SHIRTLESS HUNTING SELFIES FROM NOW ON. FOLKS, SPEAKING OF WAR, FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS WE IN THE COLBERT NATION HAVE BEEN AT WAR WITH ON-LINE SHOPPING GIANT AMAZON. OH WE'RE GOING TO WIPE THE SMIRK RIGHT OFF THAT BOX'S FACE. IT ALL STARTED WHEN AMAZON BEGAN PLAYING HARDBALL WITH MY PUBLISHER HACHETTE FOR REFUSING TO STOCK THEIR BOOKS INCLUDING MY THREE BEST-SELLERS. I JUST HOPE IT'S ALL RESOLVED BY JULY 28th. BECAUSE ANY ONE OF MY BOOKS IS THE PERFECT WAY TO SAY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU ON WORLD HEPATITIS DAY. (LAUGHTER) AND AMAZON'S UNILATERAL EMBARGO IS ESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO FIRST TIME NOVELISTS. ALSO HARMFUL TO THEM, DECIDING TO BE A NOVELIST. SO TO FIGHT BACK I TOLD YOU TO PREORDER THE HACHETTE BOOK CALIFORNIA BY EDAN LAPUKI EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE READING. OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO PUT  CALIFORNIA ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BEST-SELLER LIST AND  THANKS TO YOU THIS SUNDAY CALIFORNIA DEBUTS AT NUMBER  THREE. WE DID IT, JIMMY, DROP THE PLASTIC PACKING THINGIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU. BY THE WAY, BY THE WAY, ALL OF THIS, ALL OF THIS CAME IN AN AMAZON BOX TO PROTECT THE WATCH BATTERY THAT I ORDERED. NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEEDLESS TO SAY EDAN LEPUCKI HAS BECOME A PUBLISHING SENSATION RECENTLY SIGNING 10,000 COPIES OF CALIFORNIA IN THREE DAYS, I ASSUME HER FOLLOWUP IS ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN BATTLING TO OVERCOME A CRIPPLING CASE OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME AND HER AGENT IS ALREADY NEGOTIATING THE FILM RIGHTS. I HOPE IT COMES OUT SOON SO I DON'T HAVE TO READ THE BOOK. (LAUGHTER) OBVIOUSLY NO ONE WAS MORE PUMPED THAN LAPUKI HERSELF WHO SAID GETTING THE COLBERT BUMP HAS LEFT HER WITH A MIXTURE OF ELATION AND NAUSEA. YEAH I GOT TO SAY, A LOT OF LADIES SAY THAT. BY THE WAY, AMAZON IS A SPONSOR OF TONIGHT'S SHOW. SO I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY, GENTLEMEN. HERE NOW IS THE WOMAN WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAKE IT ALL POSSIBLE FOR HER, PLEASE WELCOME CALIFORNIA AUTHOR EDAN LAPUKI. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: NOW FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE PEOPLE LEGALLY HAVE TO REFER TO YOU AS "NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLING AUTHOR.
OH, OF COURSE.
Stephen: THAT CAN'T BE TAKEN AWAY. THAT'S LIKE SENATOR OR AMBASSADOR. ALL RIGHT, SO WALK ME THROUGH IT. WHEN YOU HEARD YOU WERE GETTING THE COLBERT BUMP, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?
I MEAN IT WAS BONKERS. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT. SHERMAN ALEXIE CALLED ME ON THE TELEPHONE.
Stephen: THAT WAS THE GUY WHO GAVE ME YOUR BOOK AS A RECOMMENDATION.
HE CALLED ME AND SAID I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK ON "THE COLBERT REPORT." AND I PRETTY MUCH FAINTED OUT IN THE BACKYARD. AND YOU KNOW, SHERMAN ALEXIE IS A BIG TIME AUTHOR. AND I'VE BEEN READING HIM FOR MANY YEARS.
Stephen: YOU'RE A BIG TIME AUTHOR TOO, NOW.
NOW I AM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW THE BOOK SALES YOU'RE NUMBER THREE RIGHT NOW ON THE BEST-SELLER LIST. IT'S THE THIRD GOODEST BOOK IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW. IT'S ABOUT A POST APOCALYPTIC DYSTOPIA IN CALIFORNIA. SO ESSENTIALLY CALIFORNIA. (LAUGHTER) HAS IT GOT A HAPPY ENDING. DON'T TELL ME THE ENDING, BUT IS IT A HAPPY ENDING.
YOU HAVE TO READ TO FIND OUT. (LAUGHTER)
IT LEAVES IT OPEN-- IT'S PRETTY HAPPY.
Stephen: OKAY, YEAH. OKAY, IS THERE ANOTHER HACHETTE AUTHOR THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUMP HERE TONIGHT TO TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE, MAYBE THEY CAN TAKE A LOOK AT.
YEAH, I'M READING STEPHAN EIRIK CLARK'S BOOK SWEETNESS #9 WHICH IS SO GOOD.
Stephen: IS IT A NEW AUTHOR.
A DEBUT NOVEL.
Stephen: CALLED SWEETNESS #9 BY STEPHAN
EIRIK CLARK.
Stephen: STEPHAN EIRIK CLARK. STEPHAN I WILL ASK YOU TO PICK TWO OF THOSE THREE NAMES.  YOU'RE BEING GREEDY. JUST STEPHAN CLARK, SWEETNESS #9. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER BOOK TO BUMP, THAT WOULD BE THE ONE. EDAN WHERE DO YOU GO FROM HERE. ARE YOUR HANDS OKAY FROM SIGNING SO MANY BOOKS.
YOU KNOW, THEY ARE. THEY CALLED ME THE ROBOT BECAUSE I COULD SIGN 10,000 COPIES IN TWO DAYS. I WAS THE FASTEST SIGNER EVER.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WOW. YOU ARE A GOOD WRITER. WELL, EDAN LEPUCKI WOULD YOU LIKE TO THANK THE COLBERT NATION.

Stephen: EDAN LAPUKI, CALIFORNIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD LUCK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
