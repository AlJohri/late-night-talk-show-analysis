[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. I'M BACK WITH EMILY BAZELON  TALKING ABOUT SUPREME COURT'S  UPCOMING DECISION ON GAY  MARRIAGE. WHY DOES THIS FALL TO ANTHONY  KENNEDY AGAIN? HE GETS TO MAKE EVERY DECISION. THESE DAYS LIKE IF YOU GO TO A  GROCERY STORE AND THEY SAY PAPER  OR PLASTIC, YOU HAVE TO ASK ANTHONY KENNEDY.
HE IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL  MAN. THE SUPREME COURT REFLECTS THE  DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS WHO APPOINT  THE JUSTICES. WE'RE A DIVIDED COUNTRY. THE COURT IS DIVIDED AND KENNEDY  IS THE FOCAL POINT RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: WHO HAD THE  STRONGER ARGUMENT THERE?
I WAS AMAZED AT HOW WEAK THE  ARGUMENTS AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE  WERE.
Stephen: NO, THEY ARE  INCREDIBLY STRONG. YOU HAVE TO MAKE BABIES.
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT  ARGUMENT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW  BABIES ARE MADE, RIGHT?
I KNOW HOW THEY ARE MADE BUT  WE HAVE NEVER SAID PROCREATION  IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF  MARRIAGE.
Stephen: WE HAVE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT WE.
THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT  LEAVES OUT.
Stephen: THEY DIDN'T HAVE  TO BEFORE.
THAT'S WHY BRINGING IT UP NOW  IS SUSPECT. BECAUSE THEY ARE BRINGING UP NOW  TO KEEP OUT A PARTICULAR GROUP  OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
THAT'S A FORM OF  DISCRIMINATION AND THE  GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO  MAKE LAWS JUST TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE FOR NO GOOD REASON. DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A GOOD  REASON OR NO GOOD REASON. I DID NOT HEAR ANY GOOD REASONS.
Stephen: WELL THERE'S ALSO  THE -- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT. LEGALLY IT'S SORT OF LIKE ICK,  YOU KNOW?
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A REASON  WE SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE  DIFFERENTLY UNDER THE LAW?
Stephen: AS LONG AS NO ONE  IS STICKING THEIR TONGUE OUT AT  ME.
ONE IMPORTANT RULE IS TO  PREVENT GROUPS WHO PEOPLE ARE  SUSPICIOUS OF AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST AND GAY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  DISENFRANCHISED.
Stephen: WHY NOT TWO TYPES  OF MARRIAGES. GAY MARRIAGE IS LIKE RIDING  COACH AND STRAIGHT MARRIAGE IN  FIRST CLASS. BUT IF WE ALL HAVE ONE MARRIAGE  IT'S LIKE RIDING SOUTHWEST AND  NOBODY WANTS THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. I THINK EVERYONE WILL BE IN  FIRST CLASS. I DON'T SEE WHY ALLOWING GAY  PEOPLE TO GET MARRIED BRINGS YOU  DOWN TO COACH CLASS. WHY WOULD THAT BE?
Stephen: BECAUSE THE  SPECIALNESS OF MY RELATIONSHIP  IS THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE  IT.
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT MARRIED?
Stephen: OBVIOUSLY IT'S A  BIG GAY TAUNT. OBVIOUSLY THE DOWRY WAS A BIG  PART, TOO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING AMERICA  EMILY BAZELON,
