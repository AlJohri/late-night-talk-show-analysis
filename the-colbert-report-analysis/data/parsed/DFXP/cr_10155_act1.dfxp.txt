(AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, FOLKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'M SO GLAD YOU HAVE GOT LOVE AND YOU'VE GOT ENERGY TONIGHT. I COME OUT HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, I DON'T DO THIS SHOW-- I DON'T DO THIS SHOW FOR 9 PRAISE. I DON'T DO THIS SHOW FOR THE MONEY. I DO THIS SHOW TO MAKE YOUR LIFE BETTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW FOLKS, THERE'S SO MUCH HORRIBLE NEWS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. THE EBOLA EPIDEMIC IS SPREADING. ISIS CONTINUES THEIR REIGN OF TERROR AND EVIDENTLY, AND I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING, THE NFL EMPLOYS SOME VIOLENT PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) I KNOW. WHO COULD PREDICT THAT? BUT NO MATTER HOW ROUGH THE NEWS GETS, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH ESCAPE INTO A WORLD OF FANTASY. AND I AM PERSONALLY A HUGE FAN OF THE GENRE FROM THE LORD OF THE RINGS, TO THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA TO THE NOTEBOOKS OF GALILEO. I MEAN THE EARTH GOES AROUND THE SUN? PLEASE, I GOT TWO EYES, I CAN SEE. HOW DID JOSHUA STOP THE SUN AT JERICHO, COME ON. MY LOVE OF THE FORUM GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL. I USED TO FEEL SO ALONE. IT WAS JUST--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LADIES, WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I WAS 16? BACK THEN IT WAS JUST ME AN MY 20 SIDED DIE. IN FACT, THAT DIE WAS MY PROM DATE. I DID NOT GET LUCKY THAT NIGHT. SHE MANAGED TO ROLL A SAVING THROWING AGAINST MY MAGIC WAND. (LAUGHTER) BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. THE FANTASY MARKET IS BLOWING UP. IN FACT, THE TWILIGHT SERIES ALONE HAS EARNED OVER $5.7 BILLION DOLLARS TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU LAID $5.7 BILLION END-TO-END, IT WOULD STILL BE MORE INTERESTING THAN ANY OF THE TWILIGHT MOVIES. (APPLAUSE) BUT SUPERHEROES, FOLKS, BUT SUPERHEROES ARE THE BIGGEST CAPED CASH COWS. DC HAS MADE $8.9 BILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE AND MARVEL'S MOVIES HAVE DOUBLED THAT, PROVING ONCE AGAIN IT IS MORE PROFITABLE TO BE A DEFENSE CONTRACTOR THAN A JOURNALIST. WELL, DADDY WANTS IN ON THE SCI-FI FANTASY CASH-NADO AND I RECENTLY HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ACQUIRE THE NEXT BLOCKBUSTER FRANCHISE. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE HAWKCAT. OKAY. THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRID FANTASY FRANCHISE EVER PUBLISHED IN ESPERANTO. I CAN TELL BY YOUR REACTION THAT YOU ARE HUGE FANS. SO I FEEL GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT INVESTING MY LIFESAVINGS IN THIS THING. OF COURSE PRINCE HAWKCAT IS A CHARACTER EVERYONE CAN  RELATE TO. HALF HAWK, HALF CAT, ALL PRINCE. OF COURSE HAWKS AND CATS ARE NATURAL ENEMIES SO IF YOU SHOW HIM A MIRROR, WILL ATTACK HIMSELF. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SLAP TOGETHER A MOVIE BASED ON THIS THING, AND GET THOSE TICKETS IN TO SWEATY NERD PALMS WORLDWIDE. AND WHAT BETTER PLACE, COME ON, PEOPLE ARE EXCITED AND WHAT BETTER PLACE TO DO MARKET RESEARCH THAN THE MECCA OF SCI-FI BRANDING AND DWEEB-ON-DWEEB DRY HUMPING --
COMICCON, THE HOLY GRAIL OF THE COVETED 18 TO 34 NERD DEMOGRAPHIC. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WEARING COSTUMES OR COSPLAY AS THEIR FAVORITE CHARACTERS. SOME OF THEM SPOOKILY ACCURATE. IN ORDER TO REACH THESE PEOPLE, I WOULD HAVE TO BECOME ONE OF THEM. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I AM HAWKCAT. I TOOK TO THE STREETS SURROUNDED BY HIDDEN CAMERAS, READY TO FEND OFF HAWKCAT'S ADORING FANS.
HERE I AM, PRINCE HAWKCAT. CAN YOU GUESS WHO I AM?
YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY EAGLE --
VERY CLOSE, EAGLE IS CLOSE.
NOT STARHAWK.
TELL ME, PLEASE.
Stephen: WHAT ELSE DO I LOOK LIKE BESIDES A HAWK.
NOTHING, I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I DON'T WANT TO-- .
Stephen: WHISKERS.
OKAY.
PUT THEM TOGETHER. ARE YOU SO CLOSE.
HAWKCAT.
Stephen: HAWKCAT, PRINCE HAWKCAT.
OH, OKAY, NOW I SEE --
SOUNDS GOOD.
Stephen: THANKS, LIKE A CAT CAN LICK HIMSELF BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE HAS A BEAK WHICH IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL. YEAH.
CAN YOU GUESS WHO I AM?
STARHAWK.
NO, DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
NO.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
NO.
DO YOU KNOW WHO STARHAWK IS?
YES!
Stephen: [BLEEP] YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS STARHAWK DOUCHEBAG, IS. NO RECOGNITION ON THE STREET BUT I KNEW ALL THAT WOULD CHANGE WHEN I GOT IN THE CONVENTION CENTER, THE BELLY OF THE GEEKBEAST. THESE PEOPLE WERE THE HARD-CORE HAWKCAT FANS. HAWKCAT. I FIT RIGHT IN.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHO I AM PLAYING?
I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
I DON'T, NO.
WHAT CHARACTER AM I PLAYING.
I DON'T KNOW.
HAWKCAT DIDN'T EXPECT TO PAY 29.99 FOR DOUGHNUTS. MALE HAWKCAT CAN'T REMEMBER HAWKCAT'S PASSWORD. [SINGING AND CHANTING]
IT WAS MAGICAL TO WALK THE VERY SAME CARPET THAT PREVIOUSLY HOSTED THE AMERICAN NEUROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION ANNUAL EXPO. PRINCE HAWKCAT RESTORED HIS DWINDLING MAGICAL POWERS BY CANNIBALIZING A DISTANT COUSIN IN THE FORM OF A FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH.
HAWKCAT NOT BIRDMAN.
A CAT BUT ALSO A HAWK.
YES.
HOW HARD COULD THIS BE? I'VE GOT EARS AND A GOD DAMN BEAK.
FOUR LETTERS, IT'S EITHER HAWK OR CAT.
HAWKCAT.
Stephen: YES! HAWKCAT.
NOW THAT THE CROWD KNEW THAT HAWKCAT WAS IN THE HOUSE, EVERYONE WANTED A PIECE.
WHAT ARE YOU DRESSED AS?
MELEFICENT.
Stephen: REALLY? WHO ARE YOU MORE EXCITED TO HAVE YOUR PICTURE WITH, ME OR HER.
YOU.
YOU PROBABLY SHOULD GO. I HAVE THIS CORNER RIGHT NOW. I MUST SAY HAWKCAT LIKES THE HAWKKITTY. MEOW. WHO ARE YOU? OH, XENA, YEAH, I SEE, EXCELLENT. SO WHAT ARE YOU?
I GUESS I'M A CHIPOTLE WORKER.
GREAT. REALLY BEAUTIFUL. GREEN MILE?
YOU COULD BE THE NEW GREEN MILE THAT IS AWESOME.
PRINCE HAWKCAT HAD TAKEN COMICCON BY STORM. NOW IT WAS TIME TO MAN MY BOOTH AND SELL MY MOVIE. FIRST UP, A PRINCE. A BATTLE FOR ALL. PBD. SCIENCE, MAGIC, BASED ON THE HAWKCAT SERIES.
CAW, MEOW.
COME TO ME, SUBJECT. HAWKCAT, GET YOUR HAWKCAT.
SOON I HAD A CROWD.
WHAT IS THIS MOVIE ABOUT?
THIS IS ABOUT A BOY, IT IS IN THE DISTANT FUTURE N 2019, BASED ON PRINCEHAWK. PRINCE HAWKCAT SERIES OF NOVELS.
ARE ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN CHINESE?
NOT CHINESE? I KNOW THE CHINESE PEOPLE GO SEE MOVIES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES THE CHINESE PEOPLE SAW.
CAN I ASK YOU WHICH TITLES YOU LIKE BETTER, TALES BEYOND DIMENSION. TERROR BOAT: DEUTERONOMY TED'S BIG DAY, OR THE BIONIC DENTIST.
ARE YOU CHINESE?
HE'S JAPANESE.
ALL RIGHT, LOOKING FOR CHINESE PEOPLE. THANK YOU.
NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF IT.
NOT HEARD OF PRINCE HAWKCAT, NO.
RESPONSE WAS MUTED TO TBD -- -- BUT LUCKILY I HAD ALSO INVESTED IN AN ANIMATED CHRISTMAS MOVIE CALLED  MANANA-MANANA. AND I KNEW JUST HOW TO SELL IT TO A ROOM FULL OF WIZARDS AND ROBOTS
HAVE YOU ACCEPTED JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOUR.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ACCEPTING JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOUR.
HAVE YOU ACCEPTED JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOUR.
NO.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED.
NOT TODAY.
HAVE YOU SEEN THE VEGGIE TALES THIS IS LIKE VEG YEAUX TALES. BUT WITH FRUIT INSTEAD OF VEGETABLES AND BANANA TIME TRAVEL AND IT'S A MAN. IT HAS A CHRISTIAN MESSAGE. YEAH, ARE YOU GUYS INTO THAT?
PAY DIRT.
STORY OF JESUS CHRIST, TOLD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A BANANA.
NO, THE BANANA IS FRIENDS WITH JESUS, STARTS OFF AS A STORY ABOUT JESUS AS A LITTLE BOY. HE'S REALLY LONELY, BECAUSE HE'S GOD AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM SO HE PRAYED TO GOD FOR A BEST FRIEND AND GOD TURNS A BANANA INTO A MAN AND HE IS A MANANA AND THEY HAVE FUN TOGETHER. AND THEN LATER, CUT TO IN THE PRESENT DAY THERE IS AN ATHEIST, OKAY. AND HE'S A LAWYER, CLARENCE DARROW, EVOLUTION LAWYER. AND HE WANTS JESUS NOT TO HAVE SAVED MANKIND SO HE GETS IN A TIME MACHINE AND HE GOES BACK TO TRY TO DEFEND JESUS AGAINST PONTIUS PILOT SO JESUS WON'T BE CRUCIFIED TO SAVE MANKIND AND HE IS LIKE IT IS SO SUPERIMPORTANT YOU DON'T WIN THIS CASE. AND HE IS LIKE I'M TO THE GOING TO BE A COUNTRY LAWYER, BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW IT'S MY JOB. I TOOK AN OATH.
ALL RIGHT.
SO-- THEY GET HIM OFF, THEN THEY KEEP HIM IN THE TIME MACHINE AND BRING JESUS TO US THE PRESENT-DAY. THE ATHEIST LAWYER THINKS HE'S WON BUT WHAT HAPPENED IS, IS THAT BACK IN JESUS'S TIME THEY END UP CRUCIFYING THE BANANA, OKAY. AND ALL OF MANKIND IS SAVED BY THE BANANA BECAUSE HE KNEW ALL OF JESUS'S TEACHINGS AND SAVED EVERYBODY ANYWAY. ROLL OPENING CREDITS. THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM.
WE STILL ARE CHRISTIAN BUT WE WORSHIP THE BANANA THE BANANA IS SAVED. IN THE SEQUEL HE FIGHTS CRIME AND IT'S A MUSICAL. THE WHOLE THING IS A MUSICAL.
AFTER A LONG DAY OF PITCHING MY MOVIE, I NOW HAD THE INPUT I NEEDED FROM THE EXPERTS.
CAN I SEE YOUR PERMIT. UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT HAVE A PERMIT FOR MY BOOTH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, SINCE MY LIFESAVINGS ARE TIED UP IN BOTH OF THESE MOVIES, I'VE DECIDED TO BLEND THEM IN ONE NEW FILM, PRINCE MANANA HAWK-NANA. THE FIRST PART IS WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY FILMED OF MANANA, THE SECOND IS THE STORY BOARDS FOR HAWKCAT AND THE LAST TWO HOURS IS PRINCE HAWKCAT WATCHING GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY IN A MOVIE THEATRE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
