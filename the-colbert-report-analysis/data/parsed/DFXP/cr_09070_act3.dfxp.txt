APPLAUSE]SPHEENCH WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER  DEATH-ROW INMATE WHO WAS  EXHONORATED BY DNA EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: IF THE  DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID DON'T FIT,  YOU MUST ACQUIT. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE WELCOME KIRK BLOODSWORTH! THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT. SIR, YOU WERE THE VERY FIRST  INMATE TO BE SENTENCED TO DEATH  BUT EXONERATED THROUGH POST CONVICTION DNA TESTING. IT'S ALL WRITTEN ABOUT IN THE  BOOK "BLOODSWORTH" WHICH HAS  BEEN OUT NINE YEARS. THAT'S NOT REALLY WHY YOU ARE  HERE TONIGHT. YOU ARE THEY'RE TALK ABOUT YOUR  QUEST TO GET RID OF THE DEATH  PENALTY STATE BY STATE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: HOW MANY STATES  STRILT DEATH PENALTY? IT'S 33 RIGHT NOW. THAT'S COUNTING MARYLAND, THE  STATE I'M IN STEERCHGHTS NOW,  WHILE YOUR CASE IS COMPELLING, LET'S IGNORE IT FOR A MOMENT  BECAUSE -- [LAUGHTER] -- THE FACTS 6 YOUR CASE WILL  PREJUDICE THE JURY. [LAUGHTER] HOW CAN YOU GET RID OF THE DEATH  PENALTY COMPLETELY? IT IS A KNOWN DETERRENT BECAUSE  EVERYONE WHO KILLS SOMEONE  THINKS AHEAD OF TIME I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I GET  CAUGHT. WHY DO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF  IT?
AS I KNOW, AND I WORK FOR AN  ORGANIZATION CALLED WITNESS TO  INNOCENCE. I'M THE ADVOCACY DIRECTOR FOR  THEM. WE'VE FOUND 142 EXONERATED DEATH  ROW SURRIFORS IN THE --  SURVIVORS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen: THEY WERE ON DEATH  ROW AND EXONERATED THROUGH THE  USE OF DNA?
NOT ALL OF THEM BUT THROUGH  OTHER MANS. PEOPLE FALSELY CONFESSED TO  CRIMES.
Stephen: DO YOU MEAN  WITNESS IDENTIFICATION PROBLEMS?
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IN MY CASE IT WAS -- THEY SAID  THE PERSON WAS SIX FOOT FIVE,  CURLY BLONDE HAIR, TAN SKIN AND  SKINNY. WHEN WE FINALLY CAUGHT THE REAL  PERPETRATOR OF THE CRIME SOME  YEARS LATER WAS FIVE FOOT SIX AND 160.
Stephen: NO WAY HE JUST  LOST WEIGHT AND HEIGHT? [LAUGHTER]
NO.
Stephen: JUST ASKING.
NO ONE.
Steve: PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW. IF MARYLAND GETS RID OF THE  DEATH PENALTY ISN'T THAT LIKE A  HOUSE TELLING EVERYBODY IT DOESN'T HAVE GUNS? BECAUSE IF I'M GOING TO GO ON A  KILL SPREE, I'M GOING TO GO TO  MARYLAND NOW.
NO.
Stephen: BECAUSE I KNOW  THERE'S NO DEATH PENALTY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN FOUND OUT  FOR -- [LAUGHTER] -- FOR MANY YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD  ONE OF WORST APPLICATIONS OF THE  DEATH PENALTY IN THE UNITED  STATES.
Stephen: IT'S PART OF THE  FABRIC OF AMERICA. WE'VE HAD THE DEATH PENALTY  SINCE THE BEGINNING. WE HAVE. WE HAVE. IT'S AN AMERICAN -- IT'S AS  AMERICAN AS KILLING SOMEONE WITH  AN AM PIE. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M  GOING TO REFER TO IT AS THAT,  STEVEN, HOWEVER WE'VE POSSIBLY EXECUTED INNOCENT PEOPLE ALL  OVER THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: THE KILLING  INNOCENT PEOPLE CARD IS SO EASY  TO WIN THE ARGUMENT. BECAUSE IT'S THE WORST THING YOU  CAN IMAGINE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND IF THAT IS  TRUE, THEN NO STATE SHOULD HAVE  THE DEATH PENALTY.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Stephen: BECAUSE IF ONE  PERSON DIES WHO IS INNOCENT THAT  IS TOO MANY. IT'S A MURDER WE'RE ALL  COMPLICITY IN FOR LOOKING THE  OTHER WAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I NEED  TO IGNORE. YOU ARE WINNING THE ARGUMENT  USING MY MOUTH. WHICH IS NOT FAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS SAY CHRISTIAN NATION.
YES -- THIS IS A CHRISTIAN  NATION.
YES.
Stephen: AS A CHRISTIAN  NATION SHOULDN'T WE KEEP THE  DEATH PENALTY? SHOULDN'T WE -- BECAUSE WITHOUT  THE DEATH PENALTY WE WOULD  SNRIET RELIGION. [ LAUGHTER ] -- WE WOULD NOT HAVE A RELIGION.
NO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Steve: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING US, MR. BLOODSWORTH.
