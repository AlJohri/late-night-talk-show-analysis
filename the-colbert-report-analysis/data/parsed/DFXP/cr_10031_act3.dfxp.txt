WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT, WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY THAT LADY IN A COP UNIFORM TO FRISK ME. PLEASE WELCOME BRYAN A STEVENSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS SOP MUCH FOR COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. OKAY, SIR, YOU ARE THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE. AN ORGANIZATION IN BIRMINGHAM.
MONTGOMERIE.
Stephen: OKAY. EXCUSE ME, MONTGOMERIE, ALABAMA. AND YOU CHALLENGE BIAS AGAINST POOR AND MINORITIES IF IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WORK WITH PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU HAVE BEEN NAMED THE McARTHUR GENIUS GRANT AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF. YOU ALSO HAVE THE LONGEST STANDING OVATION ON RECORD AT A TED TALK. WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT GOT THOSE BRAINY TYPES ALL EXCITED?
WBLTION I WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT CONSERVATION AND THE CHALLENGES BECAUSE WE PUT SO MANY PEOPLE IN PRISON, IMPOSE HARSH CHALLENGES.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE. WE HAVE MASS INCARCERATION THAT WAS OUR GOAL AND NOW WE HAVE A CHIEFED IT.
WE'VE ALSO REALLY DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, POOR COMMUNITIES. WE CREATED DESPAIR AND HOPELESSNESS. WE'VE SPPBT A LOT OF MONEY. WE'RE NOW SPENDING $80 BILLION A YEAR TO KEEP PEOPLE IN JAILS AND PRISONS. WE CREATE A LOT OF BAD COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES. PEOPLE LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE PERMANENTLY.
Stephen: PRISONS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT PRISONS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER IN THE LAST 20 YEARS BECAUSE 20 YEARS AGO THEY WEREN'T TURNING A PROFIT. AND NOW THEY ARE, THOSE BEDS ARE FULL.
WELL, ACTUALLY THEY'RE TURNING A PROFIT FOR A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE GETTING THAT PROFIT BY TAKING MONEY FROM EDUCATION AND TAKING MONEY FROM HUMAN SERVICES AND TAKING MONEY FROM THE NEEDS OF THE ELDERLY. AND BASIC TAXPAYERS. THEY'VE GOTTEN ACTUALLY WORSE. WE'RE NOW OVERCROWD. WE'RE NOW TOLERATING ABECAUSE AND RAPE AND DYSFUNCTION. AND ACTUALLY THE CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE NEVER BEEN WORSE.
Stephen: YOU SAY THIS IS AFFECTING YOUNG PLAN MEN. GIVE ME THE DISPROPORTION. WHAT DOW MEAN.
THE BUREAU JUSTICE SUPPORTED THAT ONE IN 15 PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN EXPECT TO GO TO JAIL OR PRISON. BUT ONE IN 3 BLACK MALES CAN EXPECT TO GO TO JAIL OR PRISON. WE ACTUALLY HAVE POLICIES THAT ARE DIRECTED AT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, POOR COMMUNITIES, DRUG LAWS THAT WE ENFORCE SELECTIVELY AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND-- .
Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD NOT ENFORCE OUR DRUG LAWS. BE SOFT ON CRIME, THAT IS WHAT I AM HEARING.
I'M SAYING WE SHOULD ENFORCE THEM FAIRLY. WE SHOULDN'T ONLY ENFORCE THEM AGAINST THE POOR AND MINORITIES. BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY CREATING A SYSTEM THAT IS RACIALLY BIASED.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT LISTEN, THAT IS IF YOU BELIEVE THAT RACE MATTERS, OKAY. I DON'T SEE RACE. ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT A RACIST. I'VE MOVED BEYOND IT YOU KNOW, YOU ARE,, PEOPLE ALWAYS TELL ME YOU'RE BLACK. ARE YOU A BLACK MAN.
I AM A BLACK MAN.
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN TO PRISON.
I HAVE BEEN IN A PRISON. I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN SENTENCED TO PRISON.
Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY BLACK OR NOT.
WELL, PART OF WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ACTUALLY WE DO HAVE THIS LEGACY THAT SUGGESTS THAT RACE DOES MATTER. AND YOU CAN SEE-- .
Stephen: WHY WOULD IT MATTER?
WELL, IT MATTER BECAUSE WE FIRST ENSLAVED PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: I KNOW, I KNOW, DON'T RUB IT IN, MAN. (LAUGHTER)
AND WE DIDN'T END SLAVERY. WE TRANSITIONED FROM SLAVERY TO 100 YEARS OF TERRORISM. AND THAT TERRORISM-- .
Stephen: WHAT DOW MEAN.
WELL, IT MEANS THAT ACTUALLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS THE 100 YEARS FOLLOWING SLAVERY WERE DEFINED BY RACIAL TERROR. THEY HAD TO WORRY ABOUT LYNCHING, HATE CRIMES, THEY TO WORRY ABOUT VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION AND THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY DECADES OF SEGREGATION AND INSUBORDINATION AND HUMILIATION WHICH IS WHAT JIM CROW LAWS DID.
Stephen: SO CAN I BLAME THIS ON MUSLIMS?
NO. YOU ACTUALLY, WE ARE ALL ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR FAILURE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR RACIAL HISTORY.
Stephen: SO YOU TOO, YOU ARE A BLACK GUY, RIGHT.
EVERYBODY.
Stephen: PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I FEEL TERRIBLY GUILTY ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION. SO BLACK PEOPLE HAVE SOME BURDEN IN THIS.
WELL, YES, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, BLACKS, WHITE, LATINO, RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, EVERYBODY TO BE MORE TRUTHFUL ABOUT WHAT DISCRIMINATION AND BIGOTRY DOES TO US ALL.
Stephen: WHAT IT USED TO DO, ROSA PARKS ENDED IT.
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT.
Stephen: NOT ME, THAT WAS THE RNC.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I STILL SEE TREMENDOUS RACISM, TREMENDOUS RACISM.
Stephen: WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT.
WE DO.
Stephen: WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT-- HOLD ON. WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT. WHAT PART OF WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT DON'T YOU GET.
WELL, I GET THAT WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT. IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT RACE BECAUSE HE IS A BLACK PRESIDENT. WHICH SPEAKS TO THIS DYNAMIC OF HOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUR PAST MORE TRUTHFULLY WITH A COMMITMENT TO RECONCILIATION. AND WE'RE SEEING IT PLAY ITSELF OUT NOW. TOO MANY KIDS OF COLOR ARE PRESUMED GUILTY. THEY WALK AROUND, THEY ARE ASSUMED TO HAR WAS,.
Stephen: SOME YOUNG BLACK MEN DO COMMIT CRIMES.
NO QUESTION.
Stephen: DOESN'T IT LOGICALLY FOLLOW THAT ALL OF THEM DO?
NO, BECAUSE-- .
Stephen: FOR SAFETY'S SAKE.
NO, BECAUSE ACTUALLY SOME YOUNG WHITE MEN COMMIT CRIMES AND YOUNG WHITE GIRLS COMMIT CRIME AND OLDER WHITE MEN COMMIT CRIMES AND REPUBLICANS COMMIT CRIMES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DOING DRUG RAID, WE'RE GO TOGETHER PROJECTS, THE POOREST AND MOST DESPERATE AREAS, THAT IS WHERE WE DO MASS ARRESTS.
Stephen: I GOT A LOT OF VIEWERS IN COLLEGE DORM ROOMS RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU ARE SAYING THE COPS ARE NOT COMING FOR THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, YES.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW, WHAT'S THAT SOUND, GUYS. BESTED, BUSTED.
BUT FOR YOUR-- BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POOR COMMUNITIES AND URBAN COMMUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE THERE HAS BEEN GENERATIONAL POVERTY, MY CLIENT, THE KIDS I WORK WITH, 13, 14, FELL ME THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT TO GET PAST THE AGE OF 21 WITHOUT BEING ARRESTED AN INCARCERATED. IT THAT COMMUNITY I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.
Stephen: I KNOW ARE YOU SO ANTI-RACIST, YOU KNOW. WHY THEN DOW LIVE IN ALABAMA? BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE DOWN THERE, RIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU MOVE SOMEPLACE WHERE THERE IS NO RACISM LIKE CHICAGO OR BOSTON.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I HAVE LIVED IN BOSTONMENT AND I HAVE TO REPORT THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY RACISM IN BOSTON. THERE'S RACISM ANYWHERE.
Stephen: BUT YOU HAVE THAT CHARMING ACCENT. EVERYBODY SOUNDS LIKE GOOD WOMEN HUNTING.
IF WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS CONFRONTING RACIAL BIAS IN ALABAMA AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND DEEP SOUTH WE CAN MAKE RACIAL PROGRESS EVERYWHERE. AND WE CAN'T TOLERATE IT EVERY-- ANYWHERE.
Stephen: WELL, GOOD LUCK. GOD LESS. AND-- GOSS BLED AND STAY OUT OF JAIL, MY FRIEND.
OKAY, WILL DO.
Stephen: BRYAN STEVENSON, EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
