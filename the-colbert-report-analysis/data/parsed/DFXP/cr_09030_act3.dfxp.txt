WELCOME BACK. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE  PARTICLE AT THE END OF THE  UNIVERSE.
GREAT, NOW I KNOW HOW THE  UNIVERSE ENDS.
PLEASE WELCOME SEAN  CARROLL. CHORS PLAUS HOW'S IT GOING,  NICE TO SEE YOU,  DR. CARROLL.
MR. DOCTOR DOCTOR.
YOU CAN CALL ME SEAN.
Stephen: THANK YOU,  DR. SEAN, THANKS FOR COMING  BACK, A TV PSYCHIATRIST, DR. SEAN, THEORETICAL  PHYSICIST WHO THEORETICALLY  HELPED YOU. OKAY, NOW YOU'RE BACK AGAIN  TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE  GREAT MYSTERIES OF MODERN  THEORETICAL PHYSICS. AND THAT IS THE PARTICLE AT  THE END OF THE UNIVERSE, HOW  THE HUNT FOR THE HIS BOSAN LEADS TO US THE EDGE OF A  NEW WORLD. OKAY, YOU ARE, THIS IS THE  SECOND TIME YOU'VE BEEN ON  TO TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK YOU'RE LIKE THE FOURTH OR  FIFTH GUY WHO HAD TO COME ON  AND EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING AT THE  LARGE HEDRON COLLIDER OVER  THERE IN SWITZERLAND, RIGHT.
AND NOT AMERICA, OKAY. NOT AMERICA.
WE HAD OUR CHANCE.
WE DID.
IT MAKES IT HARD TO TRUST  IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE  UNITED STATES, DOESN'T IT, SCIENCE IS EVERYWHERE.
THE SAME SCIENCE,.
REALLY?
IN GENEVA AS IN NEW YORK  CITY.
BUT DURING THE COLD WAR  WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING THE  SOVIETS OUR GERMAN  SCIENTISTS WERE BETTER THAN  THEIR.
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT  PLACES.
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN BECAUSE  I UNDERSTAND IT WHEN YOU  EXPLAIN IT TO ME BUT THE  MOMENT YOU LEAVE THE ROOM IT EVAPORATES OUT OF MY HEAD.
COY EXPLAIN THAT USING  SCIENCE.
OKAY, OKAY. WHAT IS THE HIGG-BOSAN AND  WHY IS IT.
SO BAG-- BACK IN THE DAY  THE EARLY 60s FIS  QUIST-- PHYSICISTS WERE TRY TOUNGED STAND THE NUCLEAR  FORCES THAT HOLD TOGETHER  THE NUCLEAR A TOMORROW AND  THEY COULDN'T. THEY KEPT COMING UP WITH  THIS IDEA THAT IT WAS SPREAD  OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE WHICH IT CLEARLY DOESN'T SO THEY  CAME UP WITH THIS  BIZARRE-SOUNDING IDEA THAT  EMPATH-- EMPTY SPACE IS FILLED WITH AN ENERGY FIELD  EVERY WITH.
IMPOSSIBLE.
NO, NOT-- WE JUST GOT  EVIDENCE THAT IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: NO, I'M  GOING-- [BLEEP] BECAUSE--   (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IT IS NOT EMPTY  SPACE IF IT IS FILLED WITH  SOMETHING. CHECKMATE. I WAIT YOUR APOLOGY.
THIS IS WHY. THESE ARE SUPERSMART  SCIENTISTS THEY FIGURED OUT  THAT EVEN THE EMPTYIST OF  SPACES COULD BE FILLED WITH  SOMETHING.
Stephen: OKAY.
AND THE THING WE  DISCOVERED IN JULY IS THE  EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE  RIGHT. 48 YEARS LATER.
Stephen: OKAY. SO AGAIN WHAT IS IT?
SO THIS FIELD THAT FILLS  SPACE THAT AFFECTS ALL THE  OTHER ARTICLES THAT MOVES THROUGH IT GIVES RISE TO A  NEW PARTICLE, THE  HIGG-BOSAN.
Stephen: SO THE FIELD  GIVES RISE TO THE NATURAL,  AN ENERGY FORCE THAT GIVES RISE TO A PHYSICAL THING.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: THAT IS LIKE  TELEPORETATION.
NO, IT'S LIKE PHYSICS,  IT'S LIKE SCIENCE, IT'S LIKE  A LIGHT THAT IS COMING FROM THE LIGHT BULBS.
THIS IS A VIBRATION IN A  FEEL. THE ELECTRIC FIELD, THE  MAGNETIC FIELDS ARE  VIBRATING AND WE SEE IT AS  LIGHT.
Stephen: THAT SAY  PHYSICAL THING BECAUSE YOU  CAN GET A SUNBURN.
THAT'S RIGHT AND THE  HIGG-BOSAN IS PHYSICAL  BECAUSE IT SHOWS UP ON THE DATA, THE PLOT IS RIGHT  THERE.
Stephen: OKAY, AGAIN, I'M  NO CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING. I HAVE HEARD THIS CALLED THE  GORD PARTICLE YEAH.
Stephen: WHY IS IT CALLED  THE GOD PARTICLE.
MARKETING? :WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO  EXPLAIN HOW PORN THIS BOSAN  IS TO PHYSICISTS, IT'S THE LAST PIECE OF THIS ED I FIS  WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING FOR  THE LAST 2500 YEARS.
Stephen: IS THIS IS IT?
THIS IS THE LAST PIECE OF  THIS PART.
Stephen: SO WE'VE WON  SCIENCE.
WE'VE WON, THE WAY I LIKE  TO SAY IT --.
Stephen: CAN WE GO BACK  TO RELIGION NOW.
THE EASY PART IS NOW  OVER.
Stephen: WHAT DOW MEAN  THE EASY PART IS OVER.
WE DISCOVERED THAT THE  UNIVERSE HAS DIFFERENT PARTS  TO IT, THERE IS ODE MATTER THERE IS DARK MATTER, DARK  ENERGY, SO THE ODE MATTER,  THE STUFF THAT MAKE UP YOU AND ME, YOU AND ME MAKE UP  THE FOUR HUMOR, RED BILE,  YELLOW BILE, QUITE BILE.
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THE  ELEMENT, EARTH, AIR, FIRE  AND WATER. WHAT SINCE THEN?
QUANTUM FIELD THEY WERERY  RIGHT THERE.
OVER, THIS IS THIS BIG  HOOP, HULA HOOP THEY HAVE  UNDERNEATH THE MOUNTAIN.
THEY SPEED UP THESE TINY  PARTICLES.
99.99999 PERCENT SPEED OF  LIGHT.
Stephen: OKAYMENT AND HOW  SMALL ARE WE TALKING HERE,  LIKE AN ANT.
NO, REALLY SMALL.
Stephen: HALF AN ANT.
YEAH TUNIER.
Stephen: LIKE A GRAIN OF  RICE.
SMALLER, KEEP GOING, VERY,  VERY SMALL.
Stephen: WHAT DO WE GET  FROM KNOWING THIS, DO I GET  MY SWRET PACK NOW O OR-- TELEPORETATION OR LIGHT  SABRES, ANY OF THAT STUFF.
WE GET THE HAPPY FEELING  THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE  UNIVERSE WORKS.
Stephen: HOW MUCH DOES  THIS COST NOW?
THE LARGE HEDRON COLLIDER  WAS ABOUT $9 BILLION.
Stephen: ABOUT $9 BILLION  SO GUYS LIKE YOU WHO CAN  UNDERSTAND THIS GET HAPPY. YOU KNOW WHAT A PRESCRIPTION  OF PROZAC COSTS, RIGHT? YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT  TOO. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU KNOW. I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS  BECAUSE AGAIN I'M  INTELLECTUALLY HYDRO  PLANNING ON EXPLANATIONS. -- WHEN I TRY THINK ABOUT  THE WAY ARE YOU EXPLAINING  IT TO ME, I'M SURE ARE YOU BAD AT EXPLAINING THINGS,  BUT COULD I UNDERSTAND IT  WITHOUT THE MATH?
WAVE YOUR HAND THROUGH  THE AIR COMPARING IT TO WHAT  IT WOULD BE LIKE WAVING IT THROUGH MOLASSES T WOULD BE  HARDER TO WAVE IT THROUGH  THE MOLASSES.
Stephen: BUT FUN.
BUT FUN, EXACTLY. SO THE HIGG FIELD LIKE THE  MOLASSES. ALL THE ELECTRONS THAT MAKE  UP THE ATOMS HOLDING YOU  TOGETHER, THEY ARE MOVING  THROUGH THIS HIGGS FIELD, GETTING MASS FROM THAT.
Stephen: THEY ARE GETTING  MASS FROM MOVING --
THROUGH THE HIGGS FIELD.
IT INTERACTING WITH THEM  AND GIVING THEM MASS. THEY BECOME MASSIVE  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SEAN CARROLL,  THE PARTICLE AT THE END OF  THE UNIVERSE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
