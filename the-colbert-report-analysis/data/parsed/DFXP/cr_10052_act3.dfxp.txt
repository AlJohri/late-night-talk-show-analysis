Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A NEURO SCIENTIST WHO ANSWERS PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS BY STUDYING THE BRAIN, I AM GOING TO GET HER WITH MY MEDULA OBLON-GOTCHAS. PLEASE WELCOME PATRICIA CHURCHLAND. HEY, PATRICIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
NICE TO BE HERE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHTY-DIGHTY. YOU ARE A PROFESSOR EMERITA OF PHILOSOPHY AT UC SAN DIEGO. YOU RECEIVED A McARTHUR GENIUS AWARD FOR YOUR WORK IN NEUROPHILOSOPHY AND YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED TOUCHING A NERVE, THE SELF AS BRAIN.
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS NEUROPHILOSOPHY? DID YOU JUST PUT THE NEURO ON THERE BECAUSE AS A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR YOU WOULD NEVER GET A JOB? [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS NEUROPHILOSOPHY.
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE DISCOVERIES THAT WE ARE MAKING IN NEUROSCIENCE AND HOW THOSE DISCOVERIES MIGHT HAVE AN IMPACT ON TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE DOES MORALITY COME FROM, HOW DO WE MAKE DECISIONS? WHAT IS THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, HOW DO WE LEARN ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD.
Stephen: THERE IS ALREADY A BOOK FOR THAT. IT'S CALLED THE BIBLE. (LAUGHTER) RIGHT? HAVE YOU READ IT? HAVE YOU READ IT?
Stephen: DID YOU READ THE BIBLE?  WELL YES... LITTLE BITS AND PIECES.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE WORLD COMPLETELY YET. ALL RIGHT. BOOK OF THE REVELATION COVERS A LOT OF THIS STUFF. SO OUR MORALITY DOES NOT COME FROM MY BRAIN, MY BRAIN GETS FILLED WITH MORALITY >>NO, IT DOESN'T.
Stephen: OKAY, HOLD ON A SECOND.. YES, IT DOES. BECAUSE WE CAN PLAY THAT GAME ALL DAY LONG.
IT TURNS OUT THAT SOCIAL ANIMALS, SOCIAL MAMMALS OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE KIND.
Stephen: OKAY.
BUT ALSO THERE ARE WOLVES AND BABOONS AND MONKEYS AND CHIMPANZEES--
Stephen: NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL OF US, ME, A BABOON, ALL THE SAME.  >>HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
AND THE SOCIALITY DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON VERY SPECIFIC STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN. IF THOSE STRUCTURES ARE NOT IN PLACE, AN ANIMAL IS NOT SOCIAL. AND THE ATTACHMENT FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN ALL DEPENDS ON VERY SPECIFIC CIRCUITRY AND VERY SPECIFIC CHEMICALS.
Stephen: SO I LOVE MY CHILD BECAUSE OF CIRCUITS AND CHEMICALS?
YES. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM OTHER STUDIES OF RODENTS WHOSE BRAINS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO OURS IN THEIR STRUCTURE.
Stephen: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, GO AHEAD. THAT IF YOU DISRUPT THAT CIRCUITRY OR YOU CHANGE THE CHEMICAL BALANCE, THAT THE ATTACHMENT AND THE BONDING BETWEEN MOTHER AND BABY DOES NOT EXIST.
Stephen: SO WHAT IS THE CHEMICAL. WHAT IS THE CHEMICAL I NEED TO LOVE SOMEBODY?
WELL, THERE ARE A NUMBER THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT IS IMPORTANT IS CALLED OXYTOCIN.
Stephen: YOU CAN GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT, CAN'T YOU, GRIND THAT STUFF UP, VERY TASTY.
THAT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ONE. OXYTOCIN IS A VERY SIMPLE PEPTIDE BUT IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN MAMMALS FOR THE ATTACHMENT OF PARENTS TO OFFSPRING. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR THE ATTACHMENT OF MATES. AND SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MAMMALLIAN SPECIES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE PRAIRIE VOLES AND MONTANE VOLES AND IT IS KIND OF A ROLY-POLY RODENT.
Stephen: I KNOW WHAT A VOLE IS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PATRONIZE ME. (LAUGHTER)
AND SO IN THE MONTANE VOLES THE MATURE ONES WILL COME ALONG AND MEET THEY WILL MATE AND THEN THEY WILL GO ON THEIR WAY. HE'S LOOKING FOR MORE ACTION, SHE IS GOING TO HAVE THE BABY. BUT IN THE PRAIRIE VOLES, THEY MEET, THEY MATE, AND NOW THEY'RE BONDED FOREVER. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE MALE STAYS WITH THE FEMALES, GUARDS THE NEST, HELPS TO REAR THE YOUNG. THEY LIKE TO BE TOGETHER. IF THEY'RE SEPARATED THEY GET DEPRESSED. AND IN GENERAL, THE QUESTION THEN WAS, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE BRAIN BETWEEN THE PRAIRIE VOLE AND THE MONTANE VOLE.
THE PRAIRIE VOLE IS A CHRISTIAN. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT CHRISTIANS. IT TURNS OUT THAT IN ONE VERY SPECIFIC PART OF THE REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN, THAT THE PRAIRIE VOLE HAS A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION FROM THE MONTANE VOLE AND IF YOU CHANGE THAT ORGANIZATION, THEY BEHAVE LIKE THE MONTANE VOLE.
AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT? DO YOU CUT IT OUT? DO YOU GO IN THERE AND CHOP OUT BITS OF THE BRAIN.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO IT BIOCHEMICALLY. YOU CAN INTERRUPT THE PATHWAYS OR YOU CAN PREVENT THE RECEPTORS FROM INTERACTING.
SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT OXYTOCIN, THE OXYTOCIN THAT HELPS WITH THE BONDING AND THE PRAIRIE VOLES HAVE MORE OF THAT.
YES.
Stephen: SO IF YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS A TOTAL HORN DOG AND ALWAYS SLEEPING AROUND, IF YOU GAVE HIM SOME OXY TOCIN WOULD HE SETTLE DOWN WITH THE RIGHT WOMAN?
WELL, IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION WHICH WE REALLY DON'T KNOW-- WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO.
Stephen: HAVE WE TRIED IT ON HUMANS YET.
YES, WE HAVE.
Stephen: AND WHAT HAPPENED?
HERE IS THE INTERESTING THING. AND ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING FINDINGS IS THAT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON LEVELS OF TRUST. AND SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE OXYTOCIN ADMINISTERED TO THEM WILL SHOW GREATER TRUSTING BEHAVIOR IN A PARTICULAR SORT OF SITUATION OR GAME.
Stephen: WHEN YOU SAY THE SELF AS BRAIN, I THINK OF MY SOUL AS MYSELF, ARE YOU SAYING THAT I DON'T HAVE SOUL? (APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME NERVE TO COME ON AND SAY THAT. PATRICIA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE BOOK IS TOUCHING A NERVE. AND SHE DID. PATRICIA CHURCHLAND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
