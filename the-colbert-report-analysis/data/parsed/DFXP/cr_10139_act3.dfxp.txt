STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK TO OUR BREAKING COVERAGE OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED 40 YEARS AGO. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, AT THE CENTER OF THE WATERGATE SCANDAL WAS FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL JOHN DEAN. JOINING ME NOW IS A MAN WHO KNEW JOHN DEAN VERY WELL. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN DEAN. JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE! (APPLAUSE) YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK CALLED THE NIXON DEFENSE WHAT HE KNEW AND WHEN HE KNEW IT. ALRIGHT JOHN, YOU HEARD PAT OUT HERE BEFORE. WAS WATERGATE THAT BIG OF A DEAL? (LAUGHTER) PAT BELIEVES THE TAPES SHOULD BEEN DESTROYED. YOU'RE ON THOSE TAPES.
I AM.
STEPHEN: DO YOU BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED?
I DON'T THINK SO. IT CLEARLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE TO DESTROY THE TAPES. WHEN THE TAPES WERE REVEALED BY ALEX BUTTERFIELD, IT WAS ON FRIDAY 13TH, WHITE HOUSE LEARNS IT OVER THE WEEKEND. NIXON IS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH PNEUMONIA. HE'S TOLD THE OPTIONS, ONE IS DESTROYED, THE OTHER IS KEEP THEM. HE HAS ONE LAWYER ARGUING OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IF YOU DESTROY THEM, THE OTHER SAYS, WELL, THEY HAVEN'T SUBPOENAED YET, YOU MIGHT GET AWAY WITH DESTROYING THEM.
STEPHEN: YOU ACTUALLY SERVED FOUR MONTHS IN PRISON, AND WHAT WAS THE CHARGE?
I PLEADED TO OBSTRUCTION OF -- CONSPIRACY TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.
STEPHEN: IN RETURN FOR PLEADING YOUR GUILT, YOU TESTIFIED AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. WHEN DID YOU MAKE THE CALCULUS AND WHEN DID YOU MAKE THE CALCULUS TO TURN ON THIS GOOD MAN? (LAUGHTER)
I INFORMED MY COLLEAGUES EARLY EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING. FIRST, I WAS GOING TO HIRE A LAWYER. WHEN I BREAK RANK, I MAKE IT NO SECRET. I SAID, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE FOR ANYBODY, I'M GOING TO THE PROSECUTORS. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA, GO TO THE GRAND JURY. THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE I WOULD EITHER REMEMBER OR TESTIFY IN AN INCRIMINATING FASHION ABOUT MYSELF, BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY I FELT TO REALLY RESOLVE THE MATTER WAS TO BE VERY TRUTHFUL ABOUT IT, EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AND LAY IT OUT.
STEPHEN: YOU FAMOUSLY SAID TO THE PRESIDENT THAT THERE WAS A CANCER ON THE PRESIDENCY. WHAT DID YOU MEAN AT THE TIME?
WELL, WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO? I WAS TRYING TO GET HIS ATTENTION.
STEPHEN: THAT WOULD DO IT. IT IS.
STEPHEN: THAT IS A FATAL DIAGNOSIS. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?
I MEANT WATERGATE WAS METASTASIZING. IT WAS CONSUMING HIS TIME AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T NIXON JUST CUT THE CHAFF AWAY FROM HIM, CUT EVERYBODY LOOSE? YOU HAVE TO BE TOUGH TO BE IN POLITICS. WHY DIDN'T HE SAY HALDERMAN, EHRLICHMAN, DEAN, WHY DIDN'T HE JUST TURN YOU GUYS TO THE FEDS AND WALKED AWAY?
SHOULD HAVE. DID HE EVER TRY TO TURN ON YOU?
NOT UNTIL I TRIED TO BREAK RANK. HE'S VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE OTHERS AND ME. I HAVE TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HE WANTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EASE EVERYBODY OUT AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR THE PUBLIC. IT WAS JUST A START. I ADVISED HIM WE SHOULD ALL GO.
YOU KNEW THE PRESIDENT AS WELL, YOU HEARD PAT OUT HERE --
I DIDN'T KNOW THE PRESIDENT AS WELL AS PAT. YOU KNOW, PAT IS SOMEBODY, IN ALL THOSE TAPES -- I WAS JUST TELLING PAT BEFORE WE CAME ON, IN ALL THOSE TAPES I LISTENED TO, NIXON HAS SOMETHING NASTY TO SAY ON ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO WORKED FOR HIM BUT NOT ABOUT PAT. HE REALLY LIKED PAT.
STEPHEN: NIXON LIKED HIM. THAT'S EXCELLENT FOR THE TOMBSTONE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT AND DID -- AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE 18 1/2 MINUTES OF THE MISSING TAPES?
I DO. WHAT DID HE KNOW AND WHEN? HE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE COVERUP FROM THE BEGINNING. HE'S NOT AS ACTIVE UNTIL AFTER THE MARCH 21 CONVERSATION.
STEPHEN: DID HE ORDER -- HE DID NOT ORDER THE BREAK-IN. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE HE ORDERED THE BREAK-IN.
STEPHEN: DHID HE ORDER ANY BREAK-IN?
OH, YES, HE DID. HE ORDERED A BREAK-IN AT THE BOOKINGS INSTITUTE DURING THE PENTAGON PAPERS. HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A COPY OF THAT 1970 STUDY THAT SHOWED THE ORIGINS OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM SO HE GAVE INSTRUCTIONS ON THREE DIFFERENT TAPED CONVERSATIONS TO BREAK IN AND GET THOSE OUT.
STEPHEN: SO HE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN BECAUSE HE WAS TOO BUSY PLANNING OTHER BREAK-INS (LAUGHTER) WHAT WAS ON THE 18 MISSING MINUTES?
IT'S VERY CLEAR WHEN YOU PUT THE SEQUENCE TOGETHER -- IN FACT I PUT AN APPENDIX IN THE BOOK FOR THAT REASON SO PEOPLE COULD FOLLOW IT AND WHAT IT WAS IS HE'S DISCUSSING THE COVERUP VERY EARLY IN THE FIRST DAYS. HE DISCUSSES IT THAT EVENING, THE NEXT DAY, TWO DAYS LATER IS THE SMOKING GUN TAPE THAT REALLY CAUSES HIS PRESIDENCY TO END BECAUSE HE HAS SET UP A DEFENSE, HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT WATERGATE TILL I HAD TOLD HIM IN MARCH OF '73.
STEPHEN: THAT PROVES HE ALREADY KNEW.
YES.
STEPHEN: WERE YOU THERE WHEN THIS HAPPENED?
NO, BUT I WAS AWARE OF IT THAT MORNING. IT WAS A MAJOR EVENT. BUD CROW CALLED ME AND SAID ELVIS WANTS TO COME IN. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? I SAID WHY? HE SAID HE WANTS TO GET A BADGE FROM THE BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS SO HE CAN BE A DRUG ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. I SAID, THAT'S KIND OF UNUSUAL.
STEPHEN: HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE AN EXPERT IN THIS PHOTO. JOHN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: JOHN DEAN, THE NIXON DEFENSE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
