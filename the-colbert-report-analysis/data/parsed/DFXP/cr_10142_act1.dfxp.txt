Stephen: TONIGHT, A NEW THREAT FROM AFRICA! YOUR UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR IS LEARNING TO PLAY THE DJEMBE! THEN I SETTLE A RAGING SANDWICH CONTROVERSY. SOME ASK RYE, I ASK RYE NOT? AND MY GUEST BRIAN CHESKY FOUNDED AIRBNB WHICH LETS USERS STAY IN HOMES AROUND THE WORLD. I HAVE A PRODUCT THAT DOES THAT -- IT'S CALLED A CROWBAR! HAWAII IS FACING BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES, SO JUST WHEN THEY'RE SAYING ALOHA TO ONE, THEY'LL BE SAYING ALOHA TO ANOTHER!  (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, EVERYBODY. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME! WELCOME, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS... FOLKS... I'M SURE YOU KNOW, BUT AMERICA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA CONTINUES TO DEGRADE. BUT FINALLY, A TRUE STRONG LEADER STEPPED UP TO PUNISH TO RUSSIA, AND, NO SURPRISE, IT'S VLADIMIR PUTIN. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS STRIKING BACK AGAINST THE WEST'S ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. TODAY BANNING FOOD IMPORTS TO RUSSIA FOR ONE YEAR.
FOR THE NEXT YEAR THEY ARE BANNING ALL IMPORTS OF BEEF, PORK, FRUIT, VEGETABLE, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, CHEESE AND MILK IN ALL FORMS -- FRESH, FROZEN, PROCESSED, WHATEVER -- AND THIS APPLIES TO EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND NORWAY.
Stephen: YES, PUTIN IS IMPOSE AGO BAN ON FOOD IMPORTS FROM ALL MAJOR COUNTRIES -- AND NORWAY. I MEAN, FACE IT. NO ONE WANTS LUTEFISK. HIS SANCTIONS CAST A WIDE NET, BANNING EVERYTHING FROM AUSTRALIAN BEEF TO LATVIAN AND LITHUANIAN PORK, TO MOLDOVAN FRUIT, A RELIEF TO ALL THE MOLDOVAN PEOPLE WHO ALL REALLY HAD THEIR EYE TON THAT PEAR. THE SANCTIONS STRIKES AT PUTIN'S WORST ENEMIES, THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE.
RUSSIA RELIES ON IMPORTS FOR 40% OF ITS FOOD. SO EXPERTS SAY PUTIN IS ONLY HURTING HIS OWN COUNTRY.
Stephen: SO PUTIN IS CUTTING OFF HIS NOSE TO SPITE HIS FACE AND RUSSIANS ARE SCRAMBLING TO GET THE FRESH NOSE MEAT. BECAUSE THEY SURE AREN'T GETTING ANY OF OUR CHICKEN.
AMONG  THE ITEMS ON THE LIST THAT ARE NOW BLOCKED FROM RUSSIA ARE U.S. CHICKENS.
RUSSIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST BUYER OF U.S. CHICKEN.
Stephen: YES, RUSSIA HAS NOW CHOKED OFF OUR CHICKEN. BUT IF RUSSIA WANTS TO MESS WITH AMERICAN BUSINESS I INTEND TO FIGHT BACK WITH MY NINE-PART PLAN! WHILE TECHNICALLY A, UH-- (CHEERING) IT'S ACTUALLY A NINE-PIECE PLAN. (CHEERING) (CHEERING) OH, OH REALLY! YOU'VE GOT US NOW, VLAD. I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THE SURPLUS? I'M SURE YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR CHICKEN KIEV -- OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE KIEV-ING NOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD MAKE IT WORSE FOR US UNLESS YOU WERE TO ALSO, SAY, BAN KENTUCKY BOURBON. OH, GOLLY! DOES THAT MEAN -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- DOES THAT MEAN MORE WHISKEY FOR US? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MMM! THAT IS NOT A PROP! OKAY. I MEAN, WHATEVER WILL WE DO? I MEAN, I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO START COOKING CHICKENS IN IT! I MEAN, BOURBON GLAZED CHICKEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, OH! I MEAN -- IT'S -- IT'S NO COLD BEET SOUP, BUT IT WILL DO! I MEAN,  YOU REALLY GOT US WITH THESE SANCTIONS, PUTIN. I JUST HOPE YOU DON'T DOUBLE DOWN! OH... THAT REMINDS ME... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH! DAS VIDANIA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! MMM! FOLKS... (LAUGHTER) -- I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE JOINING US TONIGHT. IF YOU ARE JOINING US, WE TAPED THE SHOW AT 7:00, SO BY THE TIME YOU'RE SEEING THIS, YOU'RE PROBABLY DEAD.  BECAUSE THIS WEEK, THE EBOLA OUTBREAK THAT'S BEEN RAVAGING WEST AFRICA FINALLY SPREAD TO WEST-WEST AFRICA, AMERICA.  JIM?
THE GROWING EBOLA FEAR SPREADS AROUND THE COUNTRY.
THERE ARE FEARS THE OUTBREAK WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD.
AMERICANS PANICKED OVER A POSSIBLE EBOLA OUTBREAK.
FEAR AND PANIC OVER A POSSIBLE EBOLA OUTBREAK.
EBOLA OUTBREAK --
GROWING FEARS ABOUT EBOLA --
Stephen: YES! WE'RE ALL AFRAID! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE ALL AFRAID ABOUT A COMING EBOLA OUTBREAK! (CHEERING) EVERYONE IS ON HIGH ALERT! (CHEERING) BUT MOSTLY BILL IN OUR GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT! (CHEERING)  HERE'S HOW THE PLAGUE HAS SPREAD SO FAR -- TWO AMERICAN HEALTH WORKERS WHO CONTRACTED THE DISEASE WHILE TREATING PATIENTS  IN AFRICA HAVE BEEN EVACUATED TO EMORY UNIVERSITY FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. TO ADD TO THE HORROR, EMORY IS IN ATLANTA SO THEY PROBABLY HAD TO FLY DELTA! AND IT BRINGS ME NO COMFORT TO KNOW THAT EBOLA IS SPREAD ONLY THROUGH INTIMATE CONTACT WITH BODILY SECRETIONS SUCH AS VOMIT, BLOOD OR FECES. SPEAKING OF VOMIT, BLOOD AND FECES... DONALD TRUMP. (CHEERING) HE TRIED -- DONALD TRIED TO WARN US ABOUT THIS LOOMING PANDEMIC VIA TWITTER. STOP THE EBOLA PATIENTS FROM ENTERING THE U.S. TREAT THEM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OVER THERE. YES, WE SHOULD HAVE TREATED THESE DESPERATELY I'LL AMERICANS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN LIBERIA! NO CIVIL WAR ERA MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE SPARED! THE FRESHEST LEACHES! THE FINEST BITE STICKS! AND, SURE, SURE, THESE PEOPLE WERE PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO DESPERATE VILLAGERS, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DESERVE SPECIAL TREATMENT, RIGHT, DONALD?
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE, THEY'RE TREMENDOUS PEOPLE, BUT  THEY HAVE O SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
Stephen: YES! YOU HAVE TO -- NO, NO, HE'S RIGHT! NO, NO, NO, NO, WAIT, HEY, HEY... I SAID NO! YOU HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOUR GOOD  DEEDS! THAT'S WHY MOTHER THERESA'S TOMBSTONE READS "SHE HAD IT COMING"! (LAUGHTER) AND THE NUMBER OF NEW EBOLA CASES IN THE U.S. IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COUNT BECAUSE IT IS ZERO! (LAUGHTER)
SO FAR SIX AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR EBOLA, THANKFULLY ALL TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO CATCH SO I THINK IF YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT THE POSSIBLITY OF HAVING A MAJOR OUTBREAK IN THE UNITED STATES YOU SHOULD REALLY JUST RELAX, YOU KNOW, TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND WORRY ABOUT GETTING HIT BY A CAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT HIGHER  PROBABILITY OF THAT.
Stephen: YOU HEARD HIM, EBOLA HAS SPREAD TO OUR CAR DEALERSHIPS! NO WONDER THAT SALESMAN LOOKS SO SICK! HE'S HAVING A SPASM AND THEY STILL MAKE HIM COME TO WORK! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BUT, FOLKS, JUST BECAUSE NO ONE HAS CAUGHT EBOLA IN AMERICA DOESN'T MEAN EBOLA CAN'T CATCH YOU! FOX NEWS BRAIN SURGEON BEN CARSON, INFECT US WITH YOUR FEAR.
IF THERE WERE A CONTAINER OF CONTAMINATED URINE AND SOMEHOW IT MANAGED TO FIND ITS WAY TO SOMEPLACE, A LOT OF DAMAGE COULD BE DONE. YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GUARD FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIO. SO, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE COMES UP TO A LAB WORKER, HE KNOWS HE'S GOT THE URINE, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS? A LITTLE TRANSACTION THERE. I MEAN -- YOU SAY THAT'S CRAZY, NEVER COULD HAPPEN. SUCH THINGS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: NOW YOU MAY SAY DR. BEN CARSON IS JUST YANKING (BLEEP) OUT OF HIS ASS, BUT, REMEMBER, THAT'S ANOTHER WAY EBOLA IS SPREAD. (APPLAUSE) DR. CARSON IS RIGHT. DR. CARSON, THIS GOOD MAN IS RIGHT. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS GUARD AGAINST THE WORSE POSSIBLE CASE SCENARIO AND, FRANKLY, I CAN THINK OF WORSER SCENARIOS. FIRST THE TERRORIST INJECT URINE INTO CIRCUS LIONS AND RELEASE THEM INTO A BOY SCOUT JAMBOREE. OR MORE PLAUSIBLE, LET'S SAY THERE'S AN OPERA COMPANY ON THEIR WAY A GIG, BUT THEIR BUS BREAKS DOWN AND OUTSIDE OF THE CDC. THEY START SINGING, HIT A HIGH C, WHCIH CAUSES ALL THE  VIALS OF URINE TO SHATTER. THEN A COLD FRONT MOVES IN AND SUCKS ALL THE EBOLA INTO THE SKY AND SUDDENLY IT'S RAINING DEATH PEE PEE! OR OFTEN PLAUSIBLER, IT'S FRIDAY AND THE C.D.C. THROWS A PARTY, -- IT'S A FUN PLACE, THEY COULD DO THAT --  AND THEY DECIDE TO SERVE CUPS OF MOUNTAIN DEW BUT THEY CAN'T TELL THE MOUNTAIN DEW FROM THE URINE. SOMEBODY, SOMEBODY COULD ACTUALLY DRINK PEE-BOLA! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) I'M JUST JOKING. (LAUGHTER) I WOULD NEVER DO THAT. THEY'RE BOTH URINE. (APPLAUSE)  NATION -- WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE. IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHANCE TO STOP THIS SPREADING PANIC. WE MUST ISOLATE THE SOURCE OF THE OUTBREAK. OUR IMAGINATION! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
