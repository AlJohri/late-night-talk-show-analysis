Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, IN THE "A" BLOCK OF THE SHOW I TOLD YOU WHY RELEASING THE TORTURE REPORT WAS A BAD IDEA. BUT I'M A POSITIVE GUY. I WOULD RATHER SEE THE GLASS AS HALF FULL  OF WATER THAT CAN BE FORCED UP A PRISONER'S NOSE. TO HELP ME DO THAT RIGHT NOW, PLEASE WELCOME THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHIVE AT GEORGE WASHINGTON  UNIVERSITY, TOM BLANTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN ALL RIGHT, TOM, FIRST OF ALL, GREAT UNIVERSITY YOU GOT DOWN THERE. I WAS DOWN THERE ON MONDAY. LOVELY PLACE.
YEAH, SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE CAMPUS.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME. OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, THIS DOCUMENT HERE, THIS IS JUST A PARTISAN BLAME BUSH DOCUMENT, RIGHT?
IT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. IT'S THE EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY OF A HUGE STUDY --
Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S 528 PAGES. HOW MUCH MORE IS THERE?
WHAT'S THE BIG ONE? SIX MILLION PAGES OF EVIDENCE IS WHAT THEY'RE CITING IN HERE, SIX MILLION PAGES.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING SMALLER FOR ME TO READ, LIKE MAYBE A POP-UP BOOK, THOUGH I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO KNOW WHAT WOULD BE POPPING UP. ALRIGHT, YOU READ THIS THING. WHAT IS IN HERE THAT SURPRISED YOU?
I'M A DOCUMENT FETISHIST, AND THERE'S QUOTE AFTER QUOTE AFTER QUOTE --
Stephen:  SO THIS IS "50 SHADES OF GRAY "FOR YOU.
YOU GOT IT. FROM THE C.I.A. ITSELF SHOWING THE TORTURE WAS WRONG AND THEY KNEW IT. CONSTANT PEOPLE FROM THESE BLACK SITES SAYING WAIT A SECOND. THIS GOES TOO FAR. THIS IS WRONG, WE CAN'T DO THIS. I GOTTA LEAVE. THIS IS A TRAIN WRECK. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE WHEN IT GOES OFF THE CLIFF. THAT'S C.I.A. COMMENT.
Stephen: REMEMBER, WE HEARD ABOUT THIS. WE HEARD ABOUT THE STUFF YEARS AGO. IT WAS THREE GUYS. THEY WERE WATERBOARDED,   SOME PEOPLE WERE ROUGHED UP AND THAT'S IT.
IT TURNS OUT IT'S MORE LIKE 128 GUYS. TURNS OUT ABOUT 30  OF THEM WERE PUT IN COFFINS, SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, DOUSED IN COLD WATER. ONE OF THEM DIED. IT'S BIGGER THAN THEY LET ON. AND EVEN WORSE. ♪ SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF OOOH-OOO♪♪ I'M SORRY, I JUST NEED TO DIP BACK IN THERE EVERY SO OFTEN.
I UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.
Stephen: BUT WHAT IS THE VALUE OF DOING THIS? NOW KOREA AND NORTH KOREA AND CHINA HAVE SAID AMERICA IS A HYPOCRITE.
THAT'S THE FUNNY THING, THESE TECHNIQUES WERE TAKEN FROM THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS. THEY DID IT TO OUR P.O.W.s, THEY WATERBOARDED THEM TO MAKE THEM MAKE FALSE CONFESSIONS FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES. THEN  OUR MILITARY STARTED TRAINING OUR GUYS TO RESIST CAPTIVITY, IT'S A COUPLE OF THESE SURVIVAL SHRINKS, THE PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO RAN THE AIR FORCE SURVIVAL TRAINING PROGRAM --
Stephen:  THE GUYS TRYING TO HELP OUR SOLDIERS RESIST TORTURE--
THEY SOLD IT TO THE C.I.A.
Stephen: THE TWO GUYS, DR. MITCHELL AND A DR. JESSON--
JIM AND BRUCE.
Stephen: THEY GOT HOW MUCH MONEY TO DO THIS?
$81 MILLION. THAT'S ONE OF THE FACTS YOU CAN FIND OUT IN HERE.
Stephen: $81 MILLION TO DESIGN THIS THING. I'M GOING TO BE OUT OF A JOB SOON. IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET SOME OF THAT MONEY?
YOU NEED TO BE A FRIEND OF THEIRS. THEY HIRED ALL THEIR FRIENDS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. MITCHELL AND JESSON HAD NEVER HAD A SINGLE INTERROGATION IN THEIR WHOLE CAREERS -- NEVER DONE IT THEMSELVES THEY CAME IN WITH THESE TECHNIQUES THEY GOT FROM THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS WHO WERE TORTURING OUR P.O.W.s AND SAID, "THIS IS HOW WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE TERRORISTS."
Stephen: DON'T GET ME WRONG. I BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS A COUNTRY OF LAWS, BUT OUR ENEMIES ARE BRUTAL, AND DON'T WE HAVE TO BE BRUTAL IN RETURN?
IF WE MIRROR IMAGE THE BAD GUYS, THEN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR.
Stephen: WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES.   ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES. ANOTHER THIS IS-- I MEAN, YES, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO, BUT SHOULDN'T IT BE LIKE THE ATOMIC BOMB-- THAT WE, OBVIOUSLY, WILL NEVER USE IT, BUT, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S GOT TO BE AN OPTION THAT'S ON THE TABLE AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE WE'RE IN AN EXISTENTIAL FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES?
THE MOST DAMNING THING IN THIS REPORT IS NOT THE HYDRATION. THE MOST DAMNING THING IN THE REPORT IS IT USES THE C.I.A.'S OWN DOCUMENTS TO GO THROUGH ALL 20 CASES WHERE THE C.I.A., PRESIDENT BUSH, EVERYBODY SAID THIS TORTURE PREVENTED TERROR. AND THIS REPORT SHOWS EVERY ONE OF THOSE 20 CLAIMS ARE FALSE. THE KEY INFORMATION THAT LED US TO BIN LADEN DID NOT COME FROM TORTURE. THE KEY INFORMATION THAT BROKE UP THE DIRTY BOMB BLOT PLOT DID NOT COME FROM TORTURE. THESE SHRINKS, PSYCHOLOGISTS, WERE THE ONES WHO GOT TO EVALUATE THEIR OWN PROGRAM. YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY DID NOT GIVE EACH OTHER A FAILING GRADE.
Stephen: SO THEY GOT TO EVALUATE WHETHER THEIR PROGRAM WAS WORKING?
YOU GOT IT.
Stephen: THEY WERE THEIR OWN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE?
YOU GOT IT.
Stephen, OF COURSE, IF I WERE THEM I WOULD GIVE ME A GOOD GRADE BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO TO ME IF I CROSSED ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANK YOU SO MUCH. TOM BLANTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ARCHIVE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
