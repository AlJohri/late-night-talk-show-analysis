[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALIST WHO BELIEVES IT'S TIME TO PAY REPARATIONS TO BLACK PEOPLE. REPARATIONS? I GOT TO FIX THEIR AIR CONDITIONING NOW? PLEASE WELCOME TA-NEHESI COATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HEY, GOOD SEE YOU, TA-NEHISI.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING BACK. MR. COATES, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: I'M MAD AT YOU, MAN.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I'LL TELL THE PEOPLE. YOU ARE  THE NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR "THE ATLANTIC." AND AUTHOR OF THIS MONTH'S COVER STORY "THE CASE FOR REPARATIONS." YOU HAVE IT RIGHT THERE.
I DO HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.
Stephen: IT'S A BRACING 15,000-WORD ARGUMENT TALKING ABOUT SLAVERY, JIM CROW, DISCRIMINATIONS THAT COME UP TO THIS VERY DAY.
RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THE BEST WAY TO HEAL THE NATION  IS TO BUM PEOPLE OUT? [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THIS IS WELL ARGUED. I CAN UNDERSTAND IT, AND I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: MAKE YOUR CASE TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE AND UNDERSTAND, SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT WHITE. SO DON'T BE MAD AT THEM.
I WROTE THAT WITH THAT IN MIND.
Stephen: IT'S NOT JUST FOR WHITE PEOPLE. DIDN'T KNOW. BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF AN ATTACK.
OKAY. WELL, I THINK IT'S OUR HISTORY. AND I DO THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO BUM PEOPLE OUT SOMETIMES TO HEAL PEOPLE. YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR AND MAYBE YOU HAVE A KNEE INJURY AND YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS. YOU KNOW, IT'S BETTER TO KNOW THAT YOU TORE SOMETHING THAN FOR THE DOCTOR TO TELL YOU, OH, IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT ANAESTHESIA IS FOR.
BUT WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE ANY HEALING IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT WHAT GOOD DOES REPARATIONS DO? ARE WE TALKING ABOUT DISTRIBUTING MONEY?
PROBABLY SO.
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO HOW MUCH MONEY IS IT GOING TO TAKE... [LAUGHTER] TO... I HAVE SOME RIGHT HERE. I'LL JUST PICK ONE BLACK GUY, I'LL GIVE HIM A CHECK, AND I'LL BE A MODEL FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. HOW MUCH ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE, TA-NEHISI?
WELL, WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW. BUT I WILL TAKE A CHECK ON BEHALF OF MYSELF.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS TO MAKE THE DISCUSSION GO AWAY.
NO, NO, NO. THIS IS HUSH MONEY.
JUST FOR TONIGHT.
Stephen: I GAVE YOU A FRUIT PLATE BACKSTAGE. THAT'S ALL YOU GET TONIGHT. PEOPLE KNOW THAT SLAVERY HAPPENED AND I'M AGAINST IT. JIM CROW, BAD. YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT RECENT PRACTICES LIKE REDLINING NEIGHBORHOODS, NOT ALLOWING BLACK PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. BLACK PEOPLE BEING BASICALLY CHEATED IN THEIR MORTGAGES AND HAVING THEIR HOUSES TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.
WELL, WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS. ANY TIME YOU SAY THE WORD "REPARATION," PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE LONG DEAD. IN FACT, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIVE WHO HAVE BEEN DISADVANTAGED AND INJURED BY POLICIES DONE IN OUR NAME AND THAT DAMAGE DOESN'T GO AWAY WHEN WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. NEW THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE COMPILED ON TOP OF THAT DAMAGE, SO SEGREGATION IN A CITY LIKE CHICAGO, A NORTHERN CITY PEOPLE DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT NORTHERN CITIES BEING SEGREGATED, BUT SEGREGATION IN A COMMUNITY LIKE CHICAGO CREATES A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RIPE TO BE PLUNDERED WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO PEDDLE THINGS LIKE BAD LOANS FOR INSTANCE.
YOU SAY FROM COLONIAL DAYS UP UNTIL NOW, A GREAT DEAL OF WEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN BUILT ON THE BACKS OF DISADVANTAGED AND BLACK PEOPLE.
AND NOT EVEN OUR WEALTH AS A COUNTRY, BUT LIKE OUR POLICIES, OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET, THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT HOUSING IN THIS COUNTRY, SOCIAL SECURITY, THE G.I. BILL. THESE THINGS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE UNLESS WE MADE CERTAIN COMPROMISES WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS TO BE HONEST
Stephen: ARE THERE OTHER INJURED GROUPS OTHER THAN  BLACK PEOPLE? SHOULDN'T YOU GET IN LINE BEHIND THE INDIANS?
POSSIBLY.
Stephen: IT'S A SHORT LINE. THERE AREN'T MANY OF THEM LEFT. HEY, WHAT ABOUT THIS? WHAT IF WE GAVE YOU GUYS CASINOS?
THAT WASN'T MY JOKE. I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT. THAT'S ALL YOU.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A VERY WELL-ARGUED, JUST EXHAUSTIVELY RESEARCHED ARTICLE HERE, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE SOLVENCY AT THE END OF THE ARTICLE. YOU DON'T SAY THIS IS HOW WE'LL DO THE REPARATIONS. WHAT'S THE MECHANISM?
WELL, THE MECHANISM, AS I SAY IN THE ARTICLE IS HR40, THE BILL THAT JOHN CONYERS INTRODUCES EVERY YEAR, SAYS WE SHOULD  STUDY THE ISSUE. IT'S LIKE SAYING WE SHOULD STUDY IT IS NOT VERY GRATIFYING. YOU WANT A SPECIFIC NUMBER, WRITE THE CHECK...
Stephen: OR JUST STUDY AND GO NO FURTHER.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. THE IDEA OF STUDYING BEFORE YOU DO IT IS NOT ACTUALLY NEW.
Stephen: I GO FROM THE GUT. DO I WANT TO GIVE YOU ANY OF MY MONEY? NO. THAT'S MY GUT. I STUDIED MY GUT ON THAT ONE.
THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S GOOD POLICY, BUT IN THE CASE OF JAPANESE-AMERICANS, WE DID THE SAME THING. WE HAD A STUDY BEFORE WE CUT A CHECK.
Stephen: WELL, IT'S A MUCH SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE. IT IS. IT'S SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE, SO THE DAMAGE IS LESS AND THE SPECIFIC MOMENT OF HURTING THEM IS SO CONTAINED IN THE... IT STARTS WITH SLAVERY AND...
WHAT IF WE JUST TOOK IT FROM 1860.
Stephen: WE GET A MULLIGAN ON SLAVERY.
RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT'S TEMPTING. THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. CUT YOUR LOSSES ON SLAVERY.
WE COULD DO JIM CROW. HOW ABOUT WE JUST DO 20th CENTURY CRIMES.
WE'LL JUST DO LYNCHING, HOUSING SEGREGATION, EMPLOYMENT SEGREGATION, SOCIAL SECURITY, G.I. BILL...
Stephen: STEALING JAZZ, ROCK 'N' ROLL AND RAP.
VANILLA ICE.
Stephen: EXACTLY. WELL, GOOD LUCK. TA-NEHISI COATES. LET ME SEE THIS. "THE ATLANTIC." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
