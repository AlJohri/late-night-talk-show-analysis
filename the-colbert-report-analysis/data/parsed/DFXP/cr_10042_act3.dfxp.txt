IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING JOURNALISM AND NEWS OVER THIS LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS.
Stephen:  I HAVE BEEN WATCHING JOURNALISM. [CROWD CHEERING]
YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE WAY JOURNALISM TURNS LATELY.
Stephen:  IT'S VERY INTERESTING NOW.
IT'S BEEN MORE ABOUT OPINION. A LOT MORE SENSATIONAL AND A LOT MORE ABOUT CELEBRITY. AND THAT IS NOT WHERE THIS CHANNEL IS HEADED. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AT A CHANNEL THAT COVERS SERIOUS NEWS AGAIN WAS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME. AND I JUMPED IT.

I CAN'T KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING AFRAID OF THIS. I CAN'T CONVINCE PEOPLE OF THAT. ALL I CAN DO IS SAY WATCH WHAT WE DO AND I THINK IF THEY SEE WHAT WE DO ON THE AIR AND THEY SEE THE STORIES THAT WE COVER, THEY WILL I THINK THEY'LL UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE DOING SERIOUS NEWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
