WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA WHO SWITCHED FROM BEING REPUBLICAN TO DEMOCRAT. PLEASE WELCOME CHARLIE CRIST. PAY, THANKS SO MUCH, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON HERE. GOVERNOR, WE WILL GET TO WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER YOUR CHECKERED POLITICAL CAREER IN JUST A MOMENT. BUT FIRST LET'S GET THIS RIGHT OUT OF THE WAY HERE. YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED THE PARTY IS OVER. HOW THE EXTREME RIGHT HIJACKED THE GOP AND I BECAME A DEMOCRAT. THERE IT IS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU BURIED THE LEAD RIGHT THERE AT THE END OF THE TITLE. YOU WERE A REPUBLICAN, YOU BECAME A DEMOCRAT.
YES.
Stephen: HOW, AT LONG LAST SIR, HAVE YOU NO SHAME?
I AM JUST HAPPY TO BE A DEMOCRAT. I REALLY FEEL AT HOME. I ALWAYS KIND OF FELT LIKE A ROUND PEG IN A SQUARE HOLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND IT ONLY INCREASED-- .
Stephen: YOU WERE ROUND, THEY WERE SQUARE, THAT MAKES SENSE.
RIGHT T DOES, IT DOES, YES, SIR. BUT YOU KNOW, AS THE PARTY CONTINUED TO DRIFT FURTHER AND FURTHER TO THE RIGHT, WITH THE RISE OF THE TEA PARTY. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT, I JUST GOT MORE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT.
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT DIDN'T APPEAL TO YOU ANY MORE.
JEB BUSH SAID IT VERY WELL HIMSELF. THE MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERSHIP APPEARS TO BE ANTI-WOMEN, ANTI-MINORITY, ANTI-IMMIGRANT, ANTI-GAY COUPLES, ANTI-ENVIRONMENT, ANTI-EDUCATION. I MEAN PRETTY SOON THERE IS NOBODY LEFT IN ROOM AND IT JUST WASN'T A PLACE I WAS COMFORTABLE BEING ANY MORE.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT THE WRONG WAY TO LOOK AT IT. IT IS PRO FREEDOM. ALL THE THINGS YOU JUST NAMED INVOLVE SOME KIND OF REGULATION OR GIVING AWAY OUR FREEDOMS TO PEOPLE DID NOT EARN IT.
THAT'S A POINT OF VIEW.
Stephen: YEAH. IT'S THE CORRECT POINT OF VIEW, OKAY.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL, I DISAGREE RESPECTFULLY.
Stephen: YOU DO. OH, THAT'S ONE OF YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU ARE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AGAIN.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: NOW AS A DEMOCRAT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AGAINST RICK SCOTT.
INDEED.
Stephen: DO YOU EVEN HAVE TO CAMPAIGN. CAN'T YOU JUST SAY I AM CHARLIE CRIST. I USED TO BE GOVERNOR, HOW ABOUT MORE OF THAT.
YEAH, WELL, HONESTLY, I WISH IT WERE THAT EASY BUT THE MAN HAS SAID HE IS GOING TO SPEND $100 MILLION ON THIS CAMPAIGN. HE SPENT $75 MILLION OF HIS OWN FOUR YEARS AGO.
Stephen: HOW MANY-- ARE YOU GOING TO SPEND 75 MILLION OF YOUR MONEY THIS TIME.
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY. (LAUGHTER) SO NO, NO, NO.
Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET IT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO GET THAT KIND OF CASH.
IF PEOPLE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE CHARLIE CRIST.COM WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO GO. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
WE NEED IT.
Stephen: OKAY. ARE YOU AFRAID OF RICK SCOTT.
NO SIR, I'M NOT, I'M NOT.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT AFRAID THAT HE WILL UNHINGE HIS JAW AND TRY TO SWALLOW YOU. I MEAN YOU'RE RUNNING AGAINST A NATIVE FLORIDA SWAMP CREATURE.
HE'S FROM TEXAS. HE JUST MOVED TO FLORIDA IN TIME TO QUALIFY TO RUN. YOU HAVE TO BE THERE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN RUN FOR GOVERNOR, HE GOT THERE JUST IN TIME TO BE ABLE TO RUN FOUR YEARS AGO.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AGAIN, IT IS A TOUGH STATE TO GOVERN. IT IS A TOUGH STATE TO LIVE IN. YOU KNOW. I MEAN IT'S WARM AND EVERYTHING. BUT WITHIN IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
Stephen: IT IS A CRAZY STATE.
IT'S INTERESTING. IT'S NEVER DULL. BUT IT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
Stephen: YOU SAID AT THE END OF YOUR REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CAREER CAME ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE HUGGED BY BARACK OBAMA.
Stephen: YES.
IT FIGURES PROMINENTLY IN THE BOOK IF I MAY READ THAT.
YOU INTRODUCED HIM, WHAT YEAR.
2009.
Stephen: 2009 HE HAD JUST BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU INTRODUCED HIM IN FLORIDA AND YOU SAID LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE GIVE A WARM FLORIDA WELCOME TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HE WALKED OUT TOWARDS ME. BOTH OF US SMILED. THE APPLAUSE WAS JUST ABOUT FRANTIC. WE SHOOK HANDS. THE NEW PRESIDENT LEANED FORWARD AND GAVE ME A HUG. REACH, PULL, RELEASE. AS HUGS GO, IT WASN'T ANYTHING SPECIAL IT WAS OVER IN A SECOND, LESS THAN THAT. IT IS THE KIND OF HUG THAT SAYS HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU MAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THE KIND OF HUG I HAD EXCHANGED WITH  THOUSANDS OF FLORIDIANS OVER THE YEARS. I DIDN'T THINK A THING ABOUT IT AS IT WAS HAPPENING BUT THAT SIMPLE GESTURE ENDED MY CAREER. IT REST OF MY LIFE. REACH, PULL, RELEASE. ( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. UNBELIEVABLE.
Stephen: REACH, PULL, RELEASE.
YEAH.
Stephen: ARE THOSE THE THREE WORDS YOU WANT TO USE WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MAYBE NOT. MAYBE NOT, NO, BUT-- .
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK IT ENDED IT FOR YOU?
SEVERAL REASONS, I THINK. NUMBER ONE, IF HE WAS THERE TO TALK ABOUT THE RECOVERY ACT. THE STIMULUS AS PEOPLE CALL IT. AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS TOOK ISSUE WITH THAT. SO I THINK THAT WAS PART OF IT. SADLY I THINK ANOTHER PART OF IT WAS THAT HE WAS A DEMOCRAT. BUT NOT JUST A DEMOCRAT, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN. AND.
Stephen: ARE YOU TO THE GOING TO PLAY THE RACE CARD.
I'M TO THE GOING TO PLAY IT.
Stephen: YOU JUST DID. YOU PICKED IT IT UP AGAIN AND PUT IN YOUR POCKET, YOU PLAYED THE RACE CARD.
YEAH, WELL I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL THE TRUTH. I HAVE SEEN A LEVEL OF VITRIOL DIRECTED AT THIS PRESIDENT THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN DIRECTED AT, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT KENNEDY OR MAYBE PRESIDENT JOHNSON OR EVEN PRESIDENT CARTER.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. IF IN THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU WERE APPROACHED BY THREE MEN WHO WERE ABOUT TO HUG YOU, JOSEPH STALIN, DARTH VADER OR BARACK OBAMA, YOU HAVE TO HUG ONE OF THEM, WHICH WOULD IT BE.
MY PRESIDENT, NO QUESTION. I LOVE HIM.
Stephen: BARACK OBAMA. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, GOVERNOR, GOOD LUCK.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: PLEASE COME BACK ONCE YOU'RE THE GOVERNOR AGAIN. YOU JUST GOT THE COLBERT BUMP.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: GOVERNOR CHARLIE.
GOVERNOR CHARLIE CRIST, THE PARTY'S OVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
