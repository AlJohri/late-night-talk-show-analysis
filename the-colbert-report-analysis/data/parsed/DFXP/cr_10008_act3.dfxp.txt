Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT BROKE THE ARMSTRONG KEATING SCANDAL. BIG DEAL PLEASE WELCOME REED ALBERED GOTTI, AND VANESSA O'CONNELL. LET'S GET YOUR BONA FIDES OUT HERE. REED AND VANESSA YOU BOTH WORK FOR THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," CORRECT?
EXACTLY.
Stephen:  YOU COVER WHITE COLLAR CRIME?
CORRECT.
Stephen:  AND YOU COVER--
I'VE BEEN COVERING VICES LIKE TOBACCO, ALCOHOL.
Stephen:  SO TOGETHER WHITE COLLAR CRIME AND DOPE EQUALS LANCE ARMSTRONG. BECAUSE YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WHEELED MEN:  LANCE ARMSTRONG THE TOUR DE FRANCE AND THE GREATEST SPORTS CONSPIRACY EVER." FIRST OF ALL, LANCE IS A FRIEND.
I KNOW THAT.
Stephen:  I STICK BY MY FRIEND. I'M LOYAL TO THE END. MY FIRST QUESTION IS, DO PEOPLE STILL LIKE HIM? DO PEOPLE STILL LIKE LANCE? HOW IS HIS POPULARITY DOING?
NOT STOW GREAT.
Stephen:  WHAT DOES DLANCE DO THAT WAS SO BAD? HONEST TO GOD. IT'S JUST A BICYCLE RACE. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WHAT LITTLE KIDS DO WITH BELLS AND STREAMERS. WHY ARE WE HOLDING HIS FEET TO THE FIRE OVER THIS? IT'S NOT THE TOUR DU AMERICA. IT'S THE TOUR DE FRANCE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHY? HE FOOLED SOME FRENCH PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER )
IT'S REALLY NOT JUST ABOUT CHEATING IN CYCLING. CHEATING IN SPORTS, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT A CRIME IN THE U.S. BUT WHAT THIS BOOK IS REALLY ABOUT IS THE WHOLE CONSPIRACY AROUND COVERING UP FOR THE CHEATING IN THAT RACE. AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SORT OF TOLD THE TRUTH OVER THE YEARS AND WHO WERE CONFRONTED WITH LAWSUIT, THREATS FROM LANCE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM. I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY THE STORY.
Stephen:  SO WHAT DID HE DO? HOW DID HE GET AWAY WITH THIS. HE WON SEVEN TIMES. HOW DO YOU NOT GET CAUGHT WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT BUT GET CAUGHT YEARS LATER.
THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND SO AMAZING ABOUT THE STORY. THERE WERE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME OUT YEAR AFTER YEAR, AND SOMEHOW THIS THING KEPT SECRET, AND HE ALMOST GOT AWAY WITH IT. IF IT WEREN'T FOR A BUNCH OF COINCIDENCES AT THE VERY END, I MEAN, HE WOULD HAVE-- WE NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT ALL OF THIS.
Stephen:  WHAT WAS HE ACTUALLY DOING TO HIS BODY. THIS RACE THSH TOUR DE FRANCE, ONE THING I'LL SAY IS IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. HONEST TO GOD, IT'S DAYS IN A ROW GOING UP HILL AND DOWN HILL IN THE PYRENEES, THINGS THAT WOULD CRUSH A NON-DOPED HUMAN. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HOW WAS HE SUPER CHARGES HIMSELF?
IT EVOLVED. IT STARTED OUT WITH HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE AND TESTOSTERONE.
Stephen:  I HEARD THAT'S DELICIOUS. HE WAS ON THE T-GEL GEL?
WELL, GEL OR PATCH AND THIS EVOSMED INTO HIGHER OCTANE TYPE OF DOPING, E.P.O., EDGAR ALLEN POE IS A BLOOD-BOOSTING DRUG. THAT WAS THE 96 NAME OR LANCE ARMSTRONG CALLED IT BUTTER AS A CODE NAME.
HE KEPT IT IN THE BUTTER COMPARTMENT IN THE REFRIGERATOR.
Stephen:  AND WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM THEY SAID, "I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS NOT BUTTER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WAIT A SECOND. SO, BUT, OKAY, SO WHAT-- YOUR INITIAL REPORTING ON THIS WAS WHEN?
WE STARTED REPORTING ON IT REALLY TOGETHER BACK IN 2010 WHEN WE BROKE THE STORY OF FLOYD LANDIS, HIS FORMER TEAMMATE --
Stephen:  WHO IS THE GUY WHO WON AFTER HIM?
CORRECT. AND HE TESTED POSITIVELY AFTER THAT.
Stephen:  AND FLOYD LARKED ON LANCE. NOBODY LIKES A SQUEALER. WHAT DID HE DO WHEN HE NARCED ON HIM.
HE CALLED HIM A LIAR. HE HAD A POINT. HE DENIED USE PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUG.
IF HE HAD BEEN NICER TO FLOYD, THIS MIGHT NEVER HAVE COME OUT. BUT HE WAS A JERK TO FLOYD, AND AS A RESULT --
Stephen:  PAYBACK IS A BITCH.
Stephen:  HE OWES THE POSTAL SERVICE-- WHO WAS A SPONSOR-- LONG GREEN.
THE POSTAL SERVICE PAID $40 MILLION OVER THE YEARS TO HIS CYCLING TEAM AND NOW HE'S BEING SUED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN A WHISTLEBLOWER LAWSUIT THAT COULD END IN TRIPLE THAT. SO 120 MILLION.
Stephen:  WOW, WOW. I'M GLAD THEY'RE GOING AFTER LANCE INSTEAD OF THE HEADS OF ANY OF THE BANKS ON WALL STREET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THIS IS WHERE THE REAL WHITE COLLAR CRIME IS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. VANESSA. THANK YOU, SO MUCH, REED. THE BOOK IS "WHEELED MEN." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
