Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE A LONGTIME VIEWER OF THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I ADMIRE CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST AND ANGRY SCOOP OF ICE CREAM, RUSH LIMBAUGH. THAT'S WHY I BUYERING PEL OUT BY ELRUSH BOWS MEDIA EMPIRE-- HIS BOOKS, HIS T-SHIRTS, EVEN HIS EXCELLENCE IN BROADCASTING EXECUTIVE OFFICE CHAIR. IT HAS THE PERFECT SWIVEL ACTION YOU NEED WHEN YOU'RE MOCKING MICHAEL J. FOX'S PARKINSON'S. WELL, GET READY, FOLKS. BECAUSE NOW RUSH HAS WRITTEN A BOOK FOR KIDS.
THE CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR ANNOUNCED HE'S WRITTEN "RUSH REVERE AND THE BRAVE PILGRIMS." TIME TRAVEL ADVENTURES WITH EXCEPTIONAL AMERICANS. IT TELLS HIS VERSION OF THE THANKSGIVING STORY.
Stephen:  YES, "RUSH REVERE AND THE BRAVE PILGRIMS" AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE BRAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE WILLING TO PUT THEMSELVES BETWEEN RUSH AND A TURKEY. JUST LOOK AT THE COVER. IT'S ALMOST 40% NOT HIS HEAD. IT FEATURES RUSH REVERE, A SUBSTITUTE MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER AND A VERY SPECIAL SIDEKECK.
WE'VE GICHEN HIM A HORSE. WE'VE GIVEN HIM A TALKING HORSE. LIBERTY TALKS.
Stephen:  OF COURSE, RIB TEE IS MOSTLY SAYING, "GOOD LORD. ARE YOU SHIRE THERE'S ONLY ONE GUY SITTING ON ME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE OTHER END OF THE HORSE TELLS US MORE.
LIBERTY HAS THE ABILITY TO TIME TRAVEL. SO IN THIS BOOK RUSH REVERE GL TO THE "MAYFLOWER" AND LIBERTY AND TALK TO THE PILGRIMS AWORLD THE "MAYFLOWER" AS THEY'RE SAILING TO WHAT WILL BECOME AMERICA.
Stephen:  I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT FOR YOU, FOLKS. RUSH REVERE IS A MODERN DAY MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER WHO DRESSES LIKE PAUL REVERE, AND-- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT-- IS NOT AN OXYCONTIN HALLUCINATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OF COURSE, RUSH REVERE ISN'T JUST A TIME TRAVELING EQUESTRIAN SUBSTITUTE TEACHER. HE'S ALSO THE MASCOT FOR RUSH'S TWO IF BY TEA BOTTLED ICED TEA. IT'S THE GREATEST CORPORATE CHILDREN'S LIT TIE-IN SINCE ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, RADIO SHACK. AND RUSH IS NOT THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE HURT LICK THROUGH TIME. IN 2011, MIKE HUCKABEE SPRUCED THE "TIME TRAVEL ACADEMY" SERIES ABOUT TEENS GOING BACK IN TIME TO LEARN HISTORY WITHOUT LIBERAL BIAS. PREPARE TO BE HUCKIFIED.
THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY IS KILLING US. PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK. SOME OF OUR MORALS ARE JUST GONE.
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY.
GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEMS. GOVERNMENT IS THE PROBLEM.
Stephen:  GOOD LUCK FIND A HISTORY BOOK THAT TEACHES HOW REAGAN SAVED AMERICA FROM DISCO STABBERS. D WHO CAN FORGET CALISTA CALISTA GINGRICH'S ELLIS THE ELEPHANT SERIES. IN "SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY," ELLIS GOES BACK TO THE TIME OF THE FOUNDERS AND DISCOVERS THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, WHICH APPARENTLY INCLUDES ELEPHANTS, BUT NOT TBLAK PEOPLE. NOW, IT'S NO DISWEN ALL THESE CONSERVATIVES ARE USING TIME TRAVEL TO TEACH OUR KIDS. IT'S THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST THE LIBERAL VERSION OF HISTORY, OR AS IT'S SOMETIMES KNOWN, HISTORY. WELL, FOLKING, I WANT IN. TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM INTRODUCING MY OWN TIME TRAVELING CHILDREN'S BOOK SERIES, STEPHEN C. ROSS SEWS THE FLAG OF HISTORY.
