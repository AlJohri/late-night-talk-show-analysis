Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET IF I TELL YOU FOLKS THAT I LOVE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. NEED PROOF? WELL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IT ON FAITH. IN FACT, OUT OF 1.2 BILLION CATHOLICS OUT THERE, THERE IS ONLY ONE OF THEM WHO REALLY BOTHERS ME. IT'S THIS GUY NAMED FRANK. I AM SO P.O.-ED AT THIS SOCIALIST POOR-CODDLING, GAY NOT-JUDGING FOOT-WASHING,  ATHEIST-HUGGING AUDACITY OF POPE THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU I MAY START FLIRTING WITH OTHER RELIGIONS. FULL CONFESSION LAST NIGHT HAD A FEW DRINKS AND TEXTED YOU UP TO THAT TREE FROM AVATAR. FOLKS, I SEE YOU. I SEE YOU. AND FOLKS, THE POPE'S LATEST ASSAULT ON OUR TRADITIONAL VALUES IS OUTRAGEOUS.
POPE FRANCIS ENCOURAGED MOTHERS TO BREAST-FEED THEIR  BABIES IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL YESTERDAY DURING A BAPTISM CEREMONY, A DOWN TO EARTH PONTIFF SAID IF THEY ARE HUNGRY, THEN FEED THEM. DON'T THINK TWICE.
Stephen: HOW DARE, HOW DARE, YES I CLAP WHEN I'M ANGRY TOO. HOW DARE THE POPE ENCOURAGE JUST TO WHIP THEM OUT IN PUBLIC. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS SPENT THE PAST 2,000 YEARS MAKING US FEEL SHAME ABOUT OUR BODIES. THAT IS WHY I SHOWER IN A BATHING SUIT WHILE WEARING ONE OF THOSE DOG CONES. (LAUGHTER) OKAY? THE SHOWER IS OVER  WHEN I START TO DROWN. (LAUGHTER) PLUS ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO BREAST-FEED VIOLATES THE CENTRAL TENET OF CATHOLICISM: THERE IS NO SNACKING IN CHURCH. I SAY IF THAT KID'S ALLOWED TO CHOW DOWN AT HIS OWN PERSONAL DAIRY QUEEN I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BRING IN A PLATE OF BUFFALO WINGS, ALL RIGHT? YOU WANT TO PUT SOME-- YOU WANT TO PUT SOME BUTTS IN THE PEWS? FILL UP THE BAPTISMAL FONTS WITH BLUE CHEESE AND JUST PUT THE GAME UP ON THE ALTER. THE POINT IS SOMEONE NEEDS TO STOP THIS HIPPIE BEFORE HE STARTS WEARING TIE DYE VESTMENTS AND GIVING OUT SERMONS ABOUT JESUS MULTIPLYING THE LOAVES AND THE PHISH TICKETS. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOT ME HEADED FOR THE NARTHEX.
THE FRUGAL LIVING POPE FRANCIS IS LOOKING TO SCALE BACK THE COST OF BECOMING A SAINT. VATICAN LEADERS ARE NOW BEING GIVEN AN UNANNOUNCED REFERENCE PRICE TO USE AS A GUIDE IN SAINTHOOD APPLICATIONS,  AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO CUT BACK ON THE COST AND MAKE THE PROCESS A BIT MORE EQUAL FOR CASES WITH LESS FUNDING. CASES SUPPORTED BY WEALTHY DONORS DO TEND TO  MAKE IT THROUGH THAT PROCESS FASTER.
YOU CAN'T SLASH THE PRICE OF BECOMING A SAINT. BEING RICH IS THE FIRST MIRACLE (LAUGHTER)
SAINTHOOD IS LIKE GOD'S COUNTRY CLUB. THEY DON'T LET IN POOR PEOPLE OR JEWS. BUT-- IF THERE IS A POOR CANDIDATE THEY JUST NEED TO GET RESOURCEFUL LIKE MOTHER TERESA BY SELLING SPONSORSHIP ON THEIR ROBES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
