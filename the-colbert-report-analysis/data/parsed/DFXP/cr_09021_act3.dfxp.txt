( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN. I'LL ASK HER WHY OBAMA ISN'T  HISTORY YET. PLEASE WELCOME DORIS KEARNS  GOODWIN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  DORIS, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU  ON.
THANK YOU, SIR.
Stephen:  NOW THIS IS A BIG  HIGH TIME FOR YOU PRESIDENTIAL  HISTORIANS, RIGHT?
BIG TIME, BIG, BIG TIME.
Stephen:  NOW YOU KNOW  WHICH SORT OF PRESIDENTIAL LEGO  TO SNAP INTO THE NEXT FOUR YEARS OF OF THE-- OF THE BIG SORT OF  PICTURE YOU'RE MAKING OF  AMERICAN HISTORY. NOW YOU'RE PERHAPS MOST FAMOUS  FOR WRITING THE BOOK THAT OBAMA  SAID HE WOULD BRING INTO THE OVAL OFFICE IF HE COULD ONLY  BRING THE BIBLE AND ONE OTHER  BOOK. IT'S "TEAM OF RIVALS."
GOT IT.
Stephen:  ABOUT LINCOLN AND  HIS, YOU KNOW, CONFLICTED  CABINET. IT'S OUT RIGHT NOW IN PAPERBACK  BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE BOOKS  THAT THE MOVIE "PLIRCHGON" BY SPIELBERG IS BASED ON. YOU GOT THE DANIEL DAY LEWIS ON  THE COVER.
HE'S SEXY, DON'T YOU THINK?
Stephen:  YOU MEAN, LINCOLN  OR DANIEL DAY LEWIS? WAS LINCOLN SEXY?
I THINK SO. AND I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR  YEARS, BUT EVERYBODY THOUGHT I  WAS CRAZY. BUT NOW, THERE'S THE PROOF.
Stephen:  YEAH. OKAY.
HE WAS FUNNY, TOO. YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED HIM.
Stephen:  LINCOLN?
YEAH. HE TOLD DIRTY STORIES ALL THE  TIME. YEAH  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  CAN I HEAR ONE? ( APPLAUSE )
ACTUALLY, THERE'S ONE THAT'S  IN THE MOVIE.
Stephen:  OH, YEAH.
HE TELLS THIS STORY ABOUT  THIS GUY NAMED ETHAN ALLEN, A  REVOLUTIONARY WAR HERO-- ONE OF YOUR GUYS. HE GOES TO ENGLAND AFTER THE WAR  AND THEY WANT TO EMBARRASS HIM  AND THEY PUT A PICTURE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON IN THE ONLY OUTHOUSE  AND HE COMES OUT AND IS NOT  UPSET AT ALL. DIDN'T YOU SEE GEORGE  WASHINGTON? OH, YES. A PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE PLACE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, THERE'S NOTHING TO MAKE AN  ENGLISHMAN ( BLEEP ) FASTER THAN  THE PICTURE OF GEORGE  WASHINGTON. HE HAD HUNDREDS. HE COULD TELL THESE ON A DIME. HE FHE COULD BE HERE, YOU WOULD  LOVE HIM.
Stephen:  WHAT HAPPENED TO  HIM? ( LAUGHTER )  I'D LOVE TO HAVE HIM ON. NO, EVERY PRESIDENT-- EVERY  PRESIDENTUE SAID EVERY PRESIDENT  SORT OF SEES THEMSELVES IN A HISTORICAL CONTEXT, COMPARES  THEMSELVES TO A PREDECESSOR IN  THE WHITE HOUSE. WHO-- WHO DO YOU THINK HE IS IF  YOU'RE GOING TO COMPARE HIM TO  SOMEONE EARLIER, OBAMA, TO SOME EARLIER PRESIDENT, AND THEN WHO  DOES HE THINK HE IS?
WELL, THERE'S NO QUESTION  ONCE THEY GET IN THE WHITE  HOUSE, IT'S THE ONLY CONTEST  LEFT. WHERE DO YOU FIT IN HISTORY? YOU WALK AROUND AND YOU SEE ALL  THOSE PICTURES. DO YOU WANT TO BE MILLIARD  FILLMORE, FRANKLIN PIERCE? NO. YOU WANT TO BE LINCOLN. YOU WANT TO BE F.D.R. YOU WANT TO BE ROOSEVELT. AND I THINK HE SEES HIMSELF AS A  FIGURE IN HISTORY. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. IT MEANS HE WANTS TO BE  REMEMBERED IN TIME FOR HAVING  DONE THINGS THAT MATTER, FOR HAVING CHANGED AMERICA IN A GOOD  WAY. YOU WANT A PRESIDENT IN THERE TO  DO THAT. YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO FLOAT  AROUND TO "HAIL TO THE CHIEF  "AND GO OUT AFTER FOUR YEARS,  RIGHT. THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE SAYS  NO.
Stephen:  I WANT OBAMA TO  GO OUT AFTER FOUR YEARS FOR ANY  REASON AT ALL.
ARE YOU REALLY SAD?
Stephen:  WELL... ( LAUGHTER )  I DON'T KNOW. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN, YOU KNOW,  THEM. THE THEY.
THE PEOPLE.
Stephen:  THE PEOPLE, THAT  THEY VOTED FOR HIM. THEY BOUGHT LIE.
CAN I SING A SONG TO MAKE YOU  FEEL BETTER?  ♪ HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN  ♪ ♪.
Stephen:  THAT'S A DEMOCRAT  SONG.
♪ GET ON A RAFT WITH TAFT   ♪.
Stephen:  ISN'T? THAT SONG, ISN'T TAFT THE RAFT  HIMSELF?
HE WEIGHED 330 POUNDS SO IT  WOULD BE RACKETER SCARY TO BE ON  A RAFT WITH HIM.
Stephen:  IT WOULD BE A  DANGEROUS RAFT, EXACTLY.
I DON'T THINK I'M MAKING YOU  HAPPY, THOUGH.
Stephen:  YOU ALWAYS MAKE  ME HAPPY BEING HERE. WHAT'S THE DAY LIKE FOR THE GUY  AFTER HE LOSES. LAST NIGHT IT WAS PROBABLY NONE  COMPUS MENTIS. WHAT IS THE DAY LIKE FOR THE  LOSER?
I KNOW BECAUSE I LIVED WITH  MANY OF THESE DEAD PRESIDENTS  BECAUSE I-- WELL THEY'RE NOT  PRESIDENTS. NIXON SAID HE COULDN'T SLEEP FOR  DAYS. HE SAID, "WHAT IF I HADN'T  AGREED TO DEBATE THAT GUY? WHAT IF I HADN'T HAD THE STUPID  MAKEUP MISSING ON MY SALLOW  FACE."  AND SIMILARLY I'M SURE ROMNEY SAID, WHAT IF I HADN'T DONE BOCA  ROTAN.
Stephen:  WHAT IF I HADN'T  TOLD ANYBODY WHAT MY PLANS WERE. DORIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, "TEAM OF  RIVALS," SEXY
