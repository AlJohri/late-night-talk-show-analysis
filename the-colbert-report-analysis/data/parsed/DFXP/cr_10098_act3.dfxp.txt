Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PIONEER OF SLAM POETRY PLEASE WELCOME SAUL WILLIAMS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SAUL, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
HELLO.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR, ACTOR, MUSICIAN. ONE OF THE BEST SELLING POETS ALIVE. WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE? BECAUSE WE HOLD POETRY UP HERE IN OUR CULTURE WE DON'T READ A LOT OF IT BUT WE SAY IT FANCY. AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST SELLING POETS ALIVE. YOU HAVE CLASS COMING OUT YOUR ASS.
YEAH, YEAH, SO I MEAN I REALLY VALUE THE $3.68 THAT I'VE EARNED.
Stephen: THAT'S MAYA ANGELOU MONEY, MY FRIEND.
EXACTLY. I GOT THAT MAYA MONEY.
Stephen: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. NOW YOU ALSO ARE STARRING, YOU ARE AN ACTOR AND YOU ARE STARRING IN A NEW MUSICAL COMING TO BROADWAY CALLED HOLLER IF YOU HEAR ME.
Stephen: YES.
AND THIS IS NOT BASED ON THE LIFE OF TUPAC BUT IT'S HIS MUSIC.
THE STORY IS NOW. THE MUSIC IS TUPAC.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET THIS PART AND WAS IT HARD TO BEAT OUT HOLOGRAM TUPAC?
NO.
Stephen: HOW DOES TUPAC TRANSLATE TO BROADWAY BECAUSE WE'RE USED TO SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME, YOU KNOW. IN FACT TUPAC WORKS BEAUTIFULLY ON STAGE, I THINK PEOPLE'S MINDS WILL BE BLOWN. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY PREPARED. THIS IS THE FIRST HIP-HOP MUSICAL TO EVER HIT BROADWAY AND I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL -- BEFORE THEY GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT, UNDERSTAND THAT IN FACT I FEEL LIKE TUPAC'S MUSIC WAS MADE FOR THIS. WAS MADE FOR THIS.
Stephen: YOU STARTED OFF AS A SLAM POET. YOU WERE ONE OF THE FATHERS OF SLAM POETRY?
WELL, I STARTED OFF IN OPEN MIKE. A SLAM-- A POETRY SLAM IS A  COMPETITIVE POETRY READING.
Stephen: OH, I LIKE THAT.
OKAY.
Stephen: BECAUSE I LIKE EVERYTHING TO BE A CONTEST. SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO WIN EVERYTHING.
I'M GOING USE MY HANDS MORE THAN YOU RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: REALLY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
GOOD LUCKY, BUDDY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DO YOU WIN A POETING, HOW DO YOU WIN ONE.
A POETING. BASICALLY THREE MINUTES. IT'S SO THERE-- THERE IS REALLY NO SUCH THING AS A SLAM POEM. IT IS JUST A POEM AND IT HAS TO FIT WITHIN THE 3 MINUTE GUIDELINE.
Stephen: DOES IT HAVE TO RHYME AND HAVE METER.
IT DOES NOT HAVE TO RHYME NOR HAVE METER.
Stephen: DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE RHYTHM.
NO, YOU COULD DO IT.
Stephen: I GET A LOT DONE WITHOUT RHYTHM. WELL, YOU MAY BE A POET OF THE STREET OF HIP-HOP, OF THE SLAM, ARE THERE CLASSICAL POETS THAT YOU ADMIRE, LIKE DO YOU LOOK TO YEATS, CUMMINGS, OR FROST, LIKE THAT.
TO BE FAIR, I'M PRETTY ACADEMICALLY STRAPPED
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
IT MEANS I'M NOT REALLY OF THE STREET.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT.
ALTHOUGH I GREW UP IN NEWBERG NEW YORK AND THE WHOLE NINE, I WAS ALSO AT UNIVERSITY, I WENT TO GRADUATE SCHOOL.
Stephen: I DIDN'T SAY YOU NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL
Stephen: I'M NOT A RACIST.
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.
Stephen: I WOULD --
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT MR. STERLING.
Stephen: WHAT? HEY, MY FRIEND. THIS WEEK SO FAR I HAVE HAD TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN GUESTS AND A LATINO GUEST, HAVE I DONE MORE TO END RACISM THAN BARACK OBAMA? (LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY SAUL WILLIAMS.
