( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. NATION, I AM IN A FANTASTIC MOOD  TONIGHT. BECAUSE IT IS PROM SEASON. I REMEMBER MY PROM LIKE IT WAS  YESTERDAY. NOT TO BRAG BUT MY DATE WAS SO  POPULAR SHE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO  TALK TO ME ALL NIGHT. OF COURSE THESE DAYS THERE'S  SOMETHING EVEN MORE GLAMOROUS  AND EXPENSIVE THAN THE PROM  ITSELF. THE PROM PROPOSAL OR AS SOME  GIET GLIEFT WATCHERS ARE CALLING  IT.
THE PROM-POSAL. Stephen: WHICH OF COURSE IS A  COMBO OF THE TWO WORDS PRO AND  MPOSAL. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIME  PROM-POSALS HAVE GOTTEN SO  ELABORATE THAT TEENS ARE BRINGING IN EVENT PLANNERS LIKE  THE HEART BANDITS WHO CHARGE  $400 FOR ORCHESTRATING CUSTOM PROM-POPALS LIKE SCAVENGER HUNTS  AND DESIGNING A SERIES OF SIGNS  ALONG HIGHWAYS ENDING WITH AN  INVITATION. GREAT IDEA. I MEAN, WHO COULD SAY NO TO  MONICA, WILL. YOU. GO. GAS FOOD LODGING. TO. FROM. TUNE TO 530 FOR TRAFFIC UPDATES  F. WITH. ME? LOVE. DEADENED. ADAM. AND MONICA SHOULD GO WITH HIM. AND PROM-POSAL PLANNERS HAVE  GREAT IDEAS LIKE, "HIRE THE HIGH  SCHOOL BAND TO ASK YOUR GIRL TO THE PROM. THE RESULT WILL BE EPIC AND YOU  WILL BE GO DOWN AS A LEGEND. YES, HIRING A MARCHING BAND IS  BOTH ROMANTIC AND THE PERFECT  WAY TO REMIND THE MARCHING BAND THAT THEY HAVE NO DATE TO THE  PROM. OF COURSE, NOW, OF COURSE,  MARCHING BANDS AND EVENT  PLANNERS ARE DONE. SO YOU'VE GOT TO UP YOUR  PROM-POSAL GAME. FOR INSTANCE, GIRLS LOVE POEMS  BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO WOO HER  WITH SOME LIMERICK ABOUT A BUCKET OR A SONNET YOU STOLE  FROM A GRAVE STONE. SO PROM NATION, TONIGHT JUST FOR  YOU, I HAVE COMMISSIONED A POEM  GUARANTEED TO LAND YOU THE DATE OF YOUR DREAMS. HERE TO READ HIS ORIGINAL  PROM-POSAL, PLEASE WELCOME THREE  MANY TIME POEM LAUREATE OF THE UNITED STATES, MR. ROBERT  PINSKY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SIR?
AS WHEN FAR OFF IN THE MIDDLE  OF THE OCEAN A BREAST-SHAPED  CURVE OF WAVE BEGINS TO WHITEN AND GATHERS AND GATHERS UNTIL IT  REACHES LAND HUGE AS A MOUNTAIN  AND BREAKS AND WHAT WAS DEEP COMES CHURNING UP FROM THE  BOTTOM IN MIGHTY SWIRLS OF  SUNKEN SAND AND LIVING THINGS AND WATER. SO IN THE SPRINGTIME EVERY RACE  OF PEOPLE AND ALL THE CREATURES  ON EARTH ALL RUSH TO CHARGE INTO THE FIRE THAT BURNS THEM. LOVE MOVES THEM ALL. AND THAT SAME WAVE AND THAT SAME  FIRE MOVES ME TO DARE ASK, WILL  YOU BE MY DATE FOR THE PROM?
Stephen: YES, ROBERT PINSKY,  YES, A THOUSAND TIMES YES. ROBERT PINSKY, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
