Stephen:  TONIGHT, A LONG-OVERDUE HONOR FOR A PRESIDENT. COULD THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL BE GETTING A CHILI'S, TOO? THEN AMERICA'S PRISONERS GET GOOD NEWS. JUST DON'T ASK HOW THAT NEWS WAS SMUGGLED IN. AND MY GUEST, DIRECTOR ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, HAS LAUNCHED A NEW LATINO-FOCUSED CABLE NETWORK. I'LL ASK HOW GIGANTE HIS SABADOS WILL BE. THERE IS A SECURITY FLAW IN INTERNET EXPLORER WHICH IS TERRIBLE NEWS FOR ANYBODY LIVING IN 1995. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE OTHER NEWS CHANNELS-- AND I HOPE YOU DON'T-- YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE LEAD STORY TODAY AND THAT IS THE RACIST COMMENTS OF L.A. CLIPPERS OWNER AND DARTH VADER WITH HIS HELMET OFF, DONALD STERLING. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'VE ALL HEARD WHAT HE SAID, AND IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, YOU'RE A RACIST. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT JUST TO REFRESH OUR OUTRAGE, STERLING AND HIS WIFE ARE SUING HIS EX-MISTRESS TO RECOVER $1.8 MILLION STERLING GAVE HER. COINCIDENTALLY, A RECORDING WAS MYSTERIOUSLY RELEASED OF STERLING LECTURING HIS MISTRESS ABOUT HER FRIENDS.
IT BOTHERS ME A LOT IF YOU WANT TO BROADCAST THAT YOU'RE ASSOCIATING WITH BLACK PEOPLE. DO YOU HAVE TO? WHY PUBLICIZE IT ON THE INSTAGRAM?
WHY BRING THE BLACK PEOPLES TO THE GAME?
HOW ABOUT YOUR WHOLE LIFE, EVERY DAY. YOU COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU COULD SLEEP WITH THEM, YOU COULD BRING THEM IN, YOU COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. THE LITTLE I ASK YOU IS NOT TO PROMOTE IT ON-- AND NOT TO BRING THEM TO MY GAMES.
Stephen:  BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T ATTEND HIS GAMES. ( BOOING ) I COULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT BETTER MYSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I AM SHOCKED THAT STERLING WOULD PERPETUATE THE CRUEL STEREOTYPE THAT WHITE PEOPLE ARE GENETICALLY SUPERIOR AT BASKETBALL SPECTATING. OH, LET ME GUESS, BECAUSE OUR MUSCULO-SKELETAL STRUCTURE MAKES IT EASIER FOR US TO PUMP CHEESE. THAT IS RACIST. AND EVERYONE HAS EXPRESSED OUTRAGE, FOLK. EVEN THE CLIPPERS' PLAYERS MADE A STATEMENT.
THE CLIPPERS PLAYERS, THEY STAGED A SILENT PROTEST DUMPING THE WARM-UP UNIFORMS ON CENTER COURT AND WEARING THEIR JERSEYS INSIDE OUT CONCEALING THE CLIPPERS' LOGO.
Stephen:  THEY CONCEALED THE BELOVED LOGO OF THE CLIPPERS WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS... ( LAUGHTER ) I WANT TO SAY A GUY GETTING A HAIRCUT OR-- OH, A TOENAIL CLIPPER WITH GOOGLY EYES. BUT, FOLKS, AS A LIFELONG BELIEVER IN LOOKING NOT RACIST, I-- I WILL NOT BE OUT-OUTRAGED. SO I HEREBY CONDEMN DONALD STERLING NOT ONLY FOR HIS RACIST COMMENTS BUT FOR THAT LAST THING HE SAID TO HIS MISTRESS ABOUT HER BLACK FRIENDS.
HOW ABOUT YOUR WHOLE LIFE, EVERY DAY, YOU COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU COULD SLEEP WITH THEM. YOU COULD BRING THEM IN. YOU COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
Stephen:  YOU COULD SLEEP WITH HIM? I'M SORRY, BUT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE SANCTITY OF TRADITIONAL INFIDELITY? ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, IT IS ONE MAN, ONE MISTRESS, $1.8 MILLION. AND STERLING SHOULD KNOW BETTER BECAUSE HE IS AN OLD HAND AT ADULTERY. WELL, HE'S AN OLD EVERYTHING. BUT HERE'S AN ACTUAL TRANSCRIPT OF HIS TESTIMONY FROM A 2003 LEGAL DISPUTE WITH A PREVIOUS MISTRESS. STERLING:  WELL, I FOOL AROUND SOMETIMES. I DO. WHEN A GIRL SEDUCES ME AND TELLS ME ALL OF THESE HOT STORIES AND DIRTY THINGS AND TELLS ME HOW MUCH SHE WANTS TO SUCK ON ME AND TAKE MY SHOES OFF AND LICK MY FEET AND TOUCHES. WHEN I'M IN A LIMOUSINE, SHE TAKES OFF ALL HER CLOTHES, THE LIMO DRIVER SAID, "WHAT IS GOING ON?" AND SHE STARTED SUCKING ON ME ON THE WAY TO MR. KOON'S HOUSE, AND I THANK HER-- I THANK HER FOR MAKING ME FEEL GOOD. LAWYER:  SIR, THE QUESTION WAS, IS THIS YOUR HANDWRITING? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) BAG BOYS OF AMERICA, NEVER ASK THIS MAN PAPER OR PLASTIC? TODAY, N.B.A. COMMISSIONER AND CARBOHYDRATE-FREE LIFE FORM ADAM SILVER ANNOUNCED STERLING'S JUST PUNISHMENT.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, I AM BANNING MR. STERLING FOR LIFE FROM ANY ASSOCIATION WITH THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION OR THE N.B.A.
Stephen:  BANNED FOR LIFE. WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MONTHS THAT MIGHT BE? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF THIS MAN-- IF THIS MAN STILL WANTS TO OWN A TEAM, I BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT AND START HIS OWN ALL-WHITE LEAGUE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE GAMES WILL BE JUST AS EXCITING. HE PASSES. AND HE PASSES BACK. AND-- AND-- AND HE DRIBBLES. AND-- AND-- AND HE PASSES? AND HE POINTS. AND HE DRIBBLES AND HE POINTS AND HE WAVES. AND, AND, AND HE PASSES. AND HE DRIBBLES AND HE PASSES. AND HE PASSES BACK. AND HE PASSES. AND HE PASSES BACK. AND HE SHOOTS. AND THE ALL-WHITE CROWD IS LOVING IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'VE GOT TO WORK ON MY TWO-HANDED BOUNCE-PASS. NATION, YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY, BUT A CLOSE SECOND IS LYING ABOUT HOW HONEST YOU ARE. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FIRST UP ON TIP-WAG, I AM A HUGE FAN OF "STAR WARS." I SAW THE ORIGINAL MOVIE WHEN I WAS 13, AND LET ME TELL YOU, PRINCESS LEIA'S FIRM, HIGH BUNS STIRRED SOMETHING IN ME. SO WHEN I HEARD THEY WERE MAKING A NEW STAR WARS LET'S JUST SAY I WAS THE ONE TO SHOOT FIRST. SO FAR-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO FAR--   ( CHEERS ) THOSE ARE STAR WARS FANS. SO FAR WE KNOW THAT MARK HAMILL, CARRIE FISHER, AND HARRISON FORD ARE ALL CONFIRMED TO BE IN THE NEW MOVIE WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE TITLED "EPISODE 7: A NEW HIP." NOW, SOME SUPER FANS OUT THERE ARE A LITTLE SKITTISH ABOUT THE RELAUNCH BUT THE DIRECTOR IS MY GOOD FRIEND J.J. ABRAMS, WHO JUST RELEASED THIS PHOTO OF THE VERY FIRST TABLE READ OF THE NEW MOVIE. IT IS SO COOL TO GET A GLIMPSE BEHIND THE SCENES. WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO J.J. ABRAMS FOR BLOWING IT. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PHOTO. EVERYTHING IS WRONG. WHERE ARE THE CREATURE DESIGNS? EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IS HUMANOID WITH TWO ARMS AND TWO LEGS. AND THOSE SEATS ARE CLEARLY NOT CANON. THEY'RE TATOOINE BATTLE COUCHES. THEY SHOULD BE DANTOOINE ATTACK SOFAS. AND HAVE THESE PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF THE HALOCRON DATABASE? I DON'T THINK SO. OH, BUT STEPHEN, I'M SURE HE'D SAY, IT'S JUST ONE PHOTO. CRY ME A MOISTURE FARM. WHATEVER SCRUFFY NERFHERDER RELEASED THIS PHOTO HAS METACHLORIANS FOR BRAINS ... NEXT UP, FOLKS, I MAKE NO SECRET OF MY LOVE OF RONALD WILSON REAGAN. MY DOG'S NAME IS GIPPER. MY POOL IS SHAPED LIKE A JELLYBEAN AND I KEEP A SLEDGEHAMMER IN MY TRUNK SO AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I CAN TEAR DOWN THAT WALL. MY APOLOGIES ONCE AGAIN TO THE SAN DIEGO ZOO. I'M SURE EVENTUALLY YOU WILL FIND THOSE LEOPARDS. FOLKS, I HAVE LONG SAID REAGAN DOES NOT GET ENOUGH PRAISE. YES, WASHINGTON, D.C.'S AIRPORT IS NAMED AFTER HIM BUT HE HAS TO SHARE THAT HONOR WITH PRESIDENT NATIONAL. SO I WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THIS.
THE FIRST ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION IS HR4017 TO DESIGNATE A PEAK LOCATED IN NEVADA AS MOUNT REAGAN.
THIS WOULD DESIGNATE ONE OF THE PEAKS NEAR LAS VEGAS AS MOUNT REAGAN.
Stephen:  THAT, OF COURSE, IS COMING TO YOU HOT AND HARD FROM NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON RESOURCES FROM CPAN42. I'M GOING TO GIVE A TIP OF MY HAT TO THE U.S. CONGRESS FOR GIVING REAGAN HIS OWN MOUNTAIN AND WHAT A MAJESTIC GEOLOGIC FORMATION IT IS. NATION, BEHOLD MOUNT REAGAN. LO HOW SHE SOARS 1,900 FEET ABOVE THE DIRT. THIS BROWN MOUNTAIN'S MAJESTY IS CROWNED WITH AN OFF-LIMITS SUBSTATION. ALL OTHER PRESIDENTIAL PEAKS BOW DOWN BEFORE YE, MOUNT REAGAN. MOUNT McKINLEY, YOUR PURE HAS NOTHING ON MOUNT REAGAN'S IRON-RICH DUST. IF THIS MOUNTAIN DOESN'T SEEM IMPRESSIVE TO YOU NOW, JUST GIVE PEOPLE THIRTY YEARS TO FORGET WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE AND IT WILL SEEM LIKE THE GREATEST MOUNTAIN OF ALL TIME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
