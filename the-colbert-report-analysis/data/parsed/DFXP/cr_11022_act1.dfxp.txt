TONIGHT: OBAMA MAKES AN IMPORTANT VISIT TO CHINA. OH, HE'S TOO GOOD TO ORDER TAKEOUT LIKE THE REST OF US. (LAUGHTER) THEN, WHO WILL BE AMERICA'S NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL? AND DID I JUST PITCH A REALITY SHOW TO C-SPAN? (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST TONIGHT IS LEGENDARY FASHION DESIGNER DIANE VON FURSTENBERG, WHOSE NEW BOOK IS "THE WOMAN I WANTED TO BE." FOR ME, IT WAS ALWAYS NANCY REAGAN. (LAUGHTER) USHER IS RELEASING HIS LATEST SINGLE INSIDE BOXES OF HONEY NUT CHEERIOS. I CAN'T BELIEVE HONEY NUT CHEERIOS SOLD OUT LIKE THAT. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT. (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU SO MUCH (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! (CHEERING) WHAT A LOVELY NIGHT. A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT FOR A BROADCAST TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NATION. THANK YOU, HEROES ALL PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. FOLKS, I WANT TO WELCOME YOU ALL. (CHEERING) FOLKS, I WANT TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO "SAYS ME STREET" BROUGHT TO YOU TONIGHT BY THE LETTER C AND THE NUMBER 19 (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NATION, AS MUCH AS THIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE US TO FORGET IT, WE ARE JUST IN THE OPENING CHAPTERS OF OUR ONGOING WAR ON TERROR, AND  OVER THE WEEKEND, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A MAJOR PLOT TWIST.
CONFLICTING REPORTS ON THE FATE OF THE LEADER OF I.S.I.S., ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI. U.S. WARPLANES ATTACKING   A CONVOY NEAR MOSUL IN IRAQ THIS WEEKEND. IT'S UNKNOWN IF THEIR TOP GUY WAS AMONG THEM.
al-BAGHDADI MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED OR WOUNDED IN A U.S. AIR STRIKE.
THE LEADER OF I.S.I.S., ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI, MAY BE DEAD TONIGHT.
Stephen: YEAH, WE MAYBE GOT YOU, SUCKER! (LAUGHTER) REST IN POSSIBLY! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I AM THEORETICALLY PUMPED THAT THIS BRUTAL MURDERER IS HYPOTHETICALLY OUT OF THE PICTURE. (LAUGHTER) I SAY, LET'S BRING THE CHAMPAGNE TO ROOM TEMPERATURE SO IT'S READY TO CHILL IF THAT PROVES NECESSARY! (LAUGHTER) AND WHILE I, OF COURSE, WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE MONSTER WHO PROMISED TO TURN NEW YORK INTO AN ASH-HEAP IS DECEASED, AT LEAST THIS UNCERTAINTY GIVES OUR TABLOIDS TIME TO STOCK UP ON THEIR ZINGER HEADLINES, LIKE WHEN SADDAM WAS SENTENCED TO HANG, THE "NEW YORK POST" WENT WITH "GOOD NOOSE." (LAUGHTER) OR WHEN WE KILLED BIN LADEN AND FOUND PORN IN HIS COMPOUND, THEY HIT US WITH THIS ACTUAL HEADLINE. "OSAMA BIN WANKIN." (LAUGHTER) AND WHO CAN FORGET THAT WHEN WE GOT AL QUAIDA IN IRAQ LEADER ABU MUSAB al-ZARQAWI, THE "POST" COVER SCREAMED "GOTCHA" AND FEATURED A DEATH PHOTO WITH A SPEECH BUBBLE SAYING "WARM UP THE VIRGINS." AND YOU KNOW THOSE WERE HIS ACTUAL LAST WORDS, BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T, LEGALLY, THE "POST" WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE A THOUGHT BUBBLE. (LAUGHTER) ONCE WE KNOW al-BAGHDADI IS DEAD FOR SURE, THERE'S GONNA BE A GOLD RUSH FOR THE PERFECT HEADLINE. WHICH IS WHY I'M STAKING MY CLAIM TONIGHT AND HEREBY COPYRIGHT THE FOLLOWING PHRASES:. Al-BAGH-DEAD-Y. (LAUGHTER) BODY-BAGHDADI. (LAUGHTER) MUCH ABU ABOUT NOTHING. (LAUGHTER) ABU GOES THE DIE-NAMITE. (LAUGHTER) LET'S CALIPH THE WHOLE THING OFF. (LAUGHTER) AND BAKR "NOT" TO THE FUTURE. (LAUGHTER) THOSE ARE MINE, "NEW YORK POST". IF YOU USE ANY OF THOSE HEADLINES, I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT. OR TO PARAPHRASE al-ZARQAWI, "WARM UP THE LAWYERS." (LAUGHTER) NATION, I KNOW I'VE OFTEN CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA A NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT, BUT I CAN'T DO THAT TONIGHT BECAUSE, TONIGHT, HE'S AN INTERNATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT. (LAUGHTER) THIS TIME, HE'S IN CHINA, WHERE HE'S ATTENDING AN ECONOMIC SUMMIT AND, ONCE AGAIN, HE HAS EMBARRASSED AMERICA. FIRST OFF, HE WORE TRADITIONAL CHINESE GARB BUT FORGOT THE STARFLEET COMMUNICATOR. (LAUGHTER) EVEN WORSE -- THAT'S NOT CANON -- EVEN WORSE WHEN HE SHOULD BE OVER THERE CHEWING CHINA OUT, HE WAS CHEWING SOMETHING ELSE.
A FAUX PAS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. SOME ARE ACCUSING HIM OF BEING RUDE FOR EMERGING FROM  HIS CAR YESTERDAY CHEWING GUM.
IT APPEARED HE WAS CHEWING GUM AS HE WALKED WITH THE CHINESE COUNTERPART.
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS IN CHINESE MEDIA THAT THE CHINESE HERE IN BEIJING WERE OFFENDED BY THE PRESIDENT'S GUM CHEWING. MR. OBAMA WAS SEEN CHEWING HIS NICORETTE GUM.
Stephen: THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS! WHY ARE YOU CHEWING NICORETTE, MR. PRESIDENT? YOU'RE IN BEIJING -- THE ONE PLACE ON EARTH WHERE INHALING BURNT TAR IS THE HEALTHY CHOICE. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M JUST AS OFFENDED AS THE CHINESE PEOPLE. AS WE ALL LEARNED   IN GRADE SCHOOL, IF YOU WANT TO CHEW GUM, YOU BRING ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY -- THAT'S 1.3 BILLION STICKS. (LAUGHTER) I ASSUME THEY LIKE BIG RED. (LAUGHTER) SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT OBAMA WAS CHARACTERIZED BY CHINESE INTERNET USERS AS AN IMPOLITE "IDLER" OR CARELESS "RAPPER." (LAUGHTER) WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH THE HIP-HOP RAPSMEN LOVE REPRESENTIN' THE G-U-M. AS SNOOP ONCE RHYME-FLOWED -- "ROLLIN' DOWN THE STREET, CHEWING SPEARMINT, THINKIN' BOUT JUICY FRUIT, WITH MY MIND ON MY BUBBLES AND MY BUBBLES ON MY MIND." (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) REST IN PEACE, TWO-PACK. (LAUGHTER) YOU, TOO, WRIGLEY SMALLS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT NOT EVERYONE AT THE SUMMIT WAS ACTING LIKE A GUM-SMACKING TEEN. REAL PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS TRYING TO GET HIM SOME DIM SUM.
VLADIMIR PUTIN GIVING HIS COAT TO CHINA'S FIRST LADY. THE REASON? SHE WAS COLD.
VLADIMIR PUTIN CREATED A STIR BY SLIPPING A SHAWL OVER THE FIRST LADY OF CHINA AND THE CHINA MEDIA, WHICH IS STATE-BACKED, IMMEDIATELY REMOVED THE IMAGE.
Stephen: WHAT A GENTLEMAN. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK VLAD, AND HE WILL GIVE YOU THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE THING THAT HAS ME EVEN MORE OUTRAGED THAN HOW MUCH DISRESPECT OBAMA SHOWED CHINA WAS HOW MUCH RESPECT HE SHOWED CHINA.
DID THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD BOW TO THE CHINESE PRESIDENT? SOME SAY YES. YOU CAN SEE HE TILTS HIS HEAD GREETING PRESIDENT XI.
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE TILTS HIS HEAD GREETING THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY.
Stephen: YES, SOME SAY HE BOWED! FIRST FOX, NOW ME -- TWO IS SOME. (LAUGHTER) AND JUST LOOK AT THAT HEAD TILT. THERE IT GOES! OH, YES! YES, IT'S BARELY NOTICEABLE, BUT MY DIGITAL TEAM WAS ABLE TO PROJECT WHERE HE WANTED TO GO WITH THAT. OH... THAT IS SHAMEFUL. I CAN'T BELIEVE   PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ALLOWING ME TO DO THIS TO HIM. AND NOW HIS PANTS ARE FALLING DOWN! (LAUGHTER) WHERE'S THE DIGNITY? SOMEBODY, COVER THAT MAN UP! (LAUGHTER) THANK YOU! AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE ENRAGED BY BARACK O-BOW-MA. (LAUGHTER) TRADEMARK, "NEW YORK POST." (LAUGHTER) FOX BUSINESS ANALYST AND UNSHAVED SPEEDBAG BO DIETL GOT HIS DIETL ALL OVER THIS STORY.
HE'S OVER IN CHINA NOW! LET THE OTHER GUY EAT SUM YUNG YO YEW -- WHATEVER HE'S EATIN' OVER THERE! SUM YUNG YOO EEE! WHO CARES ABOUT CHINA? THEY ARE INVADING ALL OF OUR COMPUTERS. THEY'RE BREACHING! THEY'RE HACKING! HE'S OVER THERE. "HELLO." I'M SURE HE BOWED 16 TIMES TO THESE GUYS. STOP IT! PRESIDENT, WHAT YOU SHOULD BE BOWING TO IS YOUR VETERANS! THAT'S WHO YOU SHOULD BE BOWING TO INSTEAD OF THE HEAD OF SAUDI ARABIA. UGA, UGA, UGA!
Stephen: YEAH! OBAMA'S CHOWIN' DOWN ON YIM YUM YOO YOO WHILE THE CHINESE ARE BREACHING OUR COMPUTER BLEEP-BLOOP BOXES! SO STOP GIVING BING BANG BOW WOWS TO THE KING KONG CHING CHONGS! THE TROOPS ARE THE ONES WHO DESERVE OUR OOGA-OOGAS! BO DIETL AND I BOTH KNOW TODAY IS VETERANS DAY -- EVEN THOUGH ONLY ONE OF US IS SURE WHAT YEAR IT IS. (LAUGHTER)
WE'RE IN 20 -- AND WHAT IS THIS? 15, ALMOST 14. WHAT WE GOT TO ALL REMEMBER, THE ONLY REASON WHY WE'RE ABLE TO SIT HERE AND TALK AND NOT WEAR ABBA-DABBA-DOO HATS OR WHATEVER IS BECAUSE OF THESE VETERANS.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. IF IT WEREN'T FOR OUR VETERANS, WE'D ALL BE WEARING ABBA-DABBA-DOO HATS, PUSHING -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PUSHING AROUND ABBA-DABBA-DOO CARS, AND ARGUING WITH OUR ABBA-DABBA-DISHWASHERS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S TIME WE COULD BE SPENDING WITH OUR BAM-BAMS. (LAUGHTER) I'M WITH BO DIETL. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IN THE YEAR -- I DUNNO, I'M GOING TO GUESS 20-TIPPITY-2, WE DON'T RESPECT OUR TROOPS. THEY FOUGHT FOR US, ON THE BEACHES OF OOH LA LAH, ZUT-DE-PUT-DE-TU-TI, IN THE JUNGLES OF VIET-PLING-PLANG, AND IN THE DESERTS OF ABOO-GABOO-STAN. THEY'RE THE HEROS. WHAT IF WE DONE WITH OUR LIVES? SPENT THEM SCREAMING ON TV. INCOHERENTLY? I JUST HOPE SOME DAY SOON I CAN LEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND. MAYBE RETIRE TO THE COAST OF RIO BA-DA-BINGO. THEN AGAIN, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE THE CLIFFS OF MALA-KAKI-KOOKY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
