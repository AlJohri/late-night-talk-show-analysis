Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM X-MEN DAYS OF THE FUTURE PAST, PLEASE WELCOME ELLEN PAGE. ELLEN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THANKS FOR HAVING ME. I'M A BIG FAN, A HUGE FAN.
Stephen: I'M AN EVEN BIGGER FAN NOW.
GREAT.
Stephen: EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM YOUR BREAKOUT JUNO AND FROM THE  FANTASTIC INCEPTION. YOU HAVE A NEW MOVIE NOW IT'S CALLED X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST IN THEATERS MAY 23rd.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: OKAY. NOW I GOT ONE PROBLEM WITH YOU.
OKAY.
Stephen: OKAY I WILL JUST GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. I'M A BIG FAN BUT I FOUND OUT, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS, AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED, YOU CAME OUT AS OPENLY CANADIAN.
UH-HUH. (LAUGHTER)
I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN OPENLY CANADIAN FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. DID YOU JUST FIND THIS OUT.
Stephen: I JUST FOUND OUT. HOW YOUNG WERE YOU WHEN YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE CANADIAN.
I MEAN, AS SOON AS I HAD LIKE ANY FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS I'M PRETTY SURE I KNEW. I KNEW, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: PEOPLE SAID YOU WANT TO GO TO DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS.
YOU I WOULD RATHER GO TO TIM HORTONS.
I WOULD RATHER GET A DOUBLE DOUBLE AND SOME TIMBITS, THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: WELL, THE MOVIE, THESE X-MEN MOVIES ARE ABOUT  PEOPLE WHO DON'T FIT INTO SOCIETY. PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT THEM. THEY THINK THEY SHOULD EITHER BE CURED OR, YOU  KNOW,-- IT'S NOT A METAPHOR OR ANYTHING, IS IT? (LAUGHTER) IT'S NOT A-- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE SATs, I JUST WANT TO GO SEE SOME QUALITY KILLS.
SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS. I WOULD ARGUE IT IS WHAT MAKES THE FRANCHISE SO SUCCESSFUL IS THAT DESPITE THE SPECTACLE AND EXTREMITY OF THE EXPERIENCE AND FANTASY OF IT ALL IT IS REALLY DEEPLY HUMAN AND SOMETHING WE CAN ALL RELATE TO. SOMETHING I KNOW I RELATE TO BECAUSE OF THE CANADIAN THING AND-- .
Stephen: YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. A LITTLE CLIP RIGHT HERE.
OKAY, GREAT.
LET'S GO.
WOW.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS DEEPLY HUMAN AND EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO THAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE, I APOLOGIZE ELLEN PAGE.
CHECKMATE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU ALSO RECENTLY CAME OUT AS BEING A THESPIAN.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: WAS THAT HARD, WAS THAT HARD TO DO HAVE YOU BEEN ACCEPTED?
IS THAT A METAPHOR?
Stephen: I THINK IT'S A MALAPROPISM BUT GO AHEAD.
WELL, YEAH, IF YOU ARE SPEAKING OF THE FACT THAT I AM A GAY PERSON.
Stephen: I AM.
YEAH, IT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MOST, YOU KNOW, NERVE-SORT OF RACKING MOMENTS OF MY LIFE AND AT THE SAME TIME I WAS JUST SO EXCITED AND THRILLED TO BE AT A PLACE WHERE I WAS READY TO DO THAT. AND GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT THAT I HAVE RECEIVED.
Stephen: AND YOU DID IT AT HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH EVENT, RIGHT.
A HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN FOUNDATION.
Stephen: AND THEN PEOPLE RESPONDED SO EFFUSIVELY THAT IT ACTUALLY BROKE THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN WEB SITE.
IT DID, YEAH.
Stephen: ARE YOU HAPPY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ARE YOU HAPPY, ELLEN PAGE. YOUR SELFISH COMING OUT BROKE HUMAN RIGHTS.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT US GAYS ARE DOING, I GUESS.
Stephen: ALL PART OF THE PLAN. ALL PART OF THE PLAN. I GOT ONE BEEF WITH YOU, WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT AND COME OUT ON MY SHOW  BECAUSE-- THE RATINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE.
WELL, YEAH, MAYBE THE COLBERT BUMP WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SCISSORING EARLIER, YOU KNOW-- .
Stephen: YOU WANT TO TRY IT. HERE, LET'S DO A LITTLE SCENE.
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: I WILL ASK YOU A QUESTION, YOUR LINES ARE ELLEN, OKAY.
OKAY, GREAT.
Stephen: SO ELLEN, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. ARE YOU SEEING ANYBODY RIGHT NOW?
NO, ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN DATING A REALLY NICE GUY NAMED BRAD.
Stephen: OH, REALLY.
NO, I'M GAY.
Stephen: WHAT? ! DOES BRAD KNOW? AND SCENE. WOW. WOW. WELL, LET ME ASK YOU, ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS OF YOURS IS JUNO. I JUST-- YOU KNOW, AS A CONSERVATIVE I JUST LOVE THAT IT WAS JUST WONDERFUL, YOUNG LADY GETS PREGNANT, KEEPS THE BABY, A WONDERFUL VALENTINE FOR THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT. THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF CONSERVATIVES.
YOU KNOW, I THIS THINK-- .
Stephen: PLEASE LET ME THANK YOU.
MAY I SAY, I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS VERY MUCH A PRO-CHOICE FILM BECAUSE JUNO EXPLORES HER OPTIONS. SHE THINKS ABOUT IT. SHE GOES TO AN ABORTION CLINIC. AND SHE DECIDES NOT TO DO IT BECAUSE THAT IS BECAUSE THE MOVIE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHORT. (APPLAUSE) YEAH.
Stephen: OH, I UNDERSTAND.
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SHORT FILM.
Stephen: JUST HOLLYWOOD LOOKING OUT FOR THE BOTTOM LINE.
IN THE END, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE
Stephen: WELL, ELLEN PAGE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN HERE TONIGHT AND NOT JUST DREAMING.
OH.
Stephen: ELLEN PAGE, X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST, ELLEN THANK YOU SO MUCH
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
