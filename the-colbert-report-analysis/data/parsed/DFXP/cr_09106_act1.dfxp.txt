Stephen: TONIGHT, AN  UNEXPECTED TREATMENT FOR HEART  DISEASE. SO IF YOU'RE HAVING A HEART  ATTACK RIGHT NOW, STICK AROUND. [LAUGHTER] THEN IS THE GOVERNMENT MEDDLING  IN OUR PRIVATE LIVES? I HAPPEN TO KNOW THEY'VE BEEN  HANDLING MY MAIL. AND MY GUEST, HARVARD PROFESSOR  NOAH FELDMAN SAYS OUR  RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS LIKE A DESTRUCTIVE MARRIAGE. MAYBE SO, BUT THE MAKE-UP WAR IS  GOING TO BE HOT. [LAUGHTER] A LONDON AUCTION HOUSE IS  OFFERING A RARE CHRISTMAS CARD  SIGNED BY ADOLF HITLER. EVEN MORE RARE, HIS HAPPY  HANUKKAH CARD. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."  CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY  COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME TO  "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH,  FOLKS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING  GOOD. SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING  GOOD, AND IF YOU'RE NOTTIC --  NOT, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS TO REPORT, TONIGHT JUSTICE HAS BEEN  SERVED FOR A COLD-BLOODED KILLER  WHO HAS BEEN AT LARGE FOR OVER 150 YEARS. OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE  PATHOGEN THAT CAUSED THE IRISH  POTATO FAMINE. SCIENTISTS IN ENGLAND EXTRACTED  D.N.A. FROM 19th CENTURY  PLANT SAMPLES TO IDENTIFY THE DISEASE AT LONG LAST, AND JUST  AS I SUSPECTEDDED, IT WAS THE  PHYTOPHTHORA NFESTANS HERB-1  STRAIN. AND I BET ALL YOU ARMCHAIR  EPIDEMOLOGISTS WHO THOUGHT IT  WAS THE 1-B HAPLOTYPE FEEL LIKE [BLEEPED] NOW. NOW, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU  THAT P. INFESTANS HERE IS A  FUNGAL INFECTION, MEANING ALL THE POTATOES IN IRELAND  BASICALLY HAD JOCK ITCH. THE WHOLE THING COULD HAVE BEEN  AVOIDED WITH A SINGLE CAN OF  CRUEX. INSTEAD IT WAS THE WORST PLAGUE  TO HIT THE IRISH SINCE WHATEVER  KEEPS DESTROYING MICHAEL FLATLY'S SHIRTS. [LAUGHTER] IT WIPED OUT A MILLION OF MY  COUNTRYMEN, AND WORSE, IT FORCED  LUCKY CHARMS TO START PUTTING MARSHMALLOWS IN ITS CEREAL  INSTEAD OF DELICIOUS POTATOES. NOT TO MENTION, HAVING LOST ALL  THEIR POTATOES, THE IRISH HAD NO  WAY TO POWER THEIR CLOCKS. TRULY DARK DAYS, FOLKS. NATION, I ALWAYS SAY, "FEED A  FEVER, STARVE A COLD, BLACKMAIL  A COUGH. ," BECAUSE I HAVE PHOTOS OF THAT  COUGH DOING THINGS THAT WOULD  MAKE YOU SICK. THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH  DR. STEPHENT. COLBERT D.F.A. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FIRST UP, A DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT  A MEDICAL DOCTOR. I HAVE AN HONORARY DOCTORATE IN  FINE ARTS, WHICH MEANS I CAN  PRESCRIBE ANTIDEPRESSANTS TO CURE YOUR BLUE PERIOD. [LAUGHTER] NOW, AS ALWAYS, TONIGHT CHEATING  DEATH IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY  PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. WHEN YOU THINK PRESCOTT, IT  MEANS OUR MEDICINE HAS NOT  CAUSED PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE. FIRST UP, FOLKS, HEART HEALTH. NOW, FOR ANY OF MY VIEWERS WHO  MIGHT HAVE A HEART, LISTEN UP. THIS NEXT STORY AFFECTS YOU.
SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING A  LITTLE SUN CAN HELP YOUR BLOOD  PRESSURE. IN A NEW STUDY, STUDIES HAVE  SHOWN EXPOSURE TO THE SUN'S RAYS  CUTS BLOOD PRESSURE AND CUTS THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK AND STROKE.
IT TURNS OUT I WASN'T BEING  CRUEL TO THOSE APTS. I WAS REDUCING THEIR RISK OF  STROKE. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THE REDUCED... THE  RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF  EDINBURGH HAD VOLUNTEERS SIT UNDER A TANNING LAMP FOR TWO,  20-MINUTE SESSIONS AND SAW THAT  BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR ONE HOUR  FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO U.V. RAYS. U.V. RAYS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR  HEART, THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS  CALLED SUN BLOCK "THE SILENT KILLER."  OF COURSE, LIKE ANY MEDICATION,  SUN EXPOSURE HAS ITS PITFALLS,  BUT THE STUDY'S AUTHOR ASSURES US WE SUSPECT THAT THE BENEFITS  TO HEART HEALTH OF SUNLIGHT WILL  OUTWEIGH THE RISK OF SKIN  CANCER. THAT IS THE KIND OF VAGUE  SUSPICION I'M WILLING TO BET MY  LIFE ON. OF COURSE, THE DISCOVERY... [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING] BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF A SUN. OF COURSE... PEOPLE LOVE PHOTOS  OF THE SUN. OF COURSE, THE DISCOVERY THAT  SUNLIGHT CAN TREAT YOUR HIGH  BLOOD PRESSURE IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE SALES OF EXISTING  BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATIONS LIKE:  NORVASC,  ZESTRIL, HYGROTON,  ESIDRIX,  LOZOL,  MYKROX,  BUMEX,  EDECRIN,  LASIX,  DEMADEX,  MIDAMOR,  ALDACTONE, DYRENIUM,  ATENOLO,  LISMELIN,  SERPASIL,  CATAPRES,  WYTENSIN,  TENEX,  ALDOMET,  CARDURA, MINIPRESS,  HYTRIN,  SECTRAL,  TENORMIN,  APRESOLINE,  COZAAR,  BENICAR,  DIOVAN,  CAPOTEN, ALTACE,  PRINIVIL,  LOPRESOR,  TOPROL,  CORGARD,  LEVATOL,  CARDIZEM,  DILACOR,  ADALAT, PROCARDIA,  AND TEKTURNA. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE IDEA  THAT THIS SUN STUDY COULD EAT  INTO THE PROFITS OF THESE PHARMACEUTICALS COULD MAKE MY  BLOOD BOIL. I SHOULD TAKE MY AVAPRO. OH, YEAH, AVAPRO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JIMMY, COULD YOU... JIMMY? THANK YOU. REGARDLESS, THE GOOD PEOPLE AT  PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS AREN'T  ONES TO LET A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH GO UNEXPLOITED. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE PROUD TO  INTRODUCE OUR NEW BLOOD PRESSURE  MEDICATION, VASCA-TOWEL. SIMPLY APPLY VASCA-TOWEL TO YOUR  FRONT LAWN... [LAUGHTER] LAY DOWN IN THE TREATMENT  RECTANGLE AND SOAK IN THE  LIFE-HEALING ULTRAVIOLET  RADIATION. FOLKS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW VASCA-TOWEL'S MOTTO:  WHEN YOUR MOLES START CHANGING  SHAPE, YOU KNOW IT'S WORKING. JUST SOAK IN THE HEALING AS  VASCA-TOWEL DOES ITS MEDICAL  MAGIC TO KEEP MOST BUT NOT ALL BUGS FROM CRAWLING ON YOU. AND REMEMBER, THESE AREN'T JUST  TOWELS WE STOLE FROM OUR AUNT'S  LINEN CLOSET. SHE SAID WE COULD HAVE THEM. SIDE EFFECTS OF VASCA-TOWEL MAY  INCLUDE DOWNTON ABSCESS, SUNNY  PEE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT  BLADDER. NEXT UP, WEIGHT LOSS. [VOMITING] NATION, SWIMSUIT SEASON IS RIGHT  AROUND THE CORNER, AND IF YOU'RE  LOOKING TO SLIM DOWN, THE BEST WAY MAY BE SPARKING UP.
PEOPLE WHO SMOKE MARIJUANA  TYPICALLY HAVE A HIGHER CALORIC  INTAKE, WHICH MAKES THIS ASPECT OF THE STUDY SO SURPRISING.
WE HAVE TO ASSUME THERE IS  SOME COMPOUND THAT IS INVOLVED  WITH MARIJUANA SMOKE THAT CAUSES AN IMPROVEMENT IN METABOLISM.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, POT  HELPS YOU LOSE WEIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] PEOPLE HERE ARE LOOKING TO DIET. I SAY WE CAN USE THIS TO STEM  THE TIDE OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY. YOUNG MAN, YOU CAN HAVE THAT  SUNDAE AFTER YOU'VE SMOKED YOUR  VEGETABLES. [APPLAUSE] NATION, IF POT IS A GATEWAY TO  EATING MORE CALORIES YET SOMEHOW  STILL ENDING UP SKINNIER, IT STANDS TO REASON THAT EVEN  HARDER DRUGS WILL HELP EVEN  MORE. THAT'S WHY PRESCOTT  PHARMACEUTICALS IS PROUD TO  INTRODUCE VASCA-METH. VASCA-METH PRECISION COOKED IN  PRESCOTT'S STATE-OF-THE-ART ROOM  ABOVE THE GARAGE, VASCA-METH IS GUARANTEED TO SLIM YOU DOWN BY  HELPING YOU SHED UNWANTED TOOTH  WEIGH. THIS SUMMER IMPRESS ALL YOUR  FRIENDS WITH YOUR NEW BIKINI  MOUTH AND YOUR WASH BOARD GUMS. [LAUGHTER] NOT ONLY THAT, BUT YOU'LL BE  SURE TO GET YOUR CARDIO IN WHEN  YOU'RE UP UNTIL 4:00 A.M. FRANTICALLY DIGGING YOUR  NEIGHBOR'S YARD FOR COPPER WIRE. SIDE EFFECTS OF VASCA-METH  INCLUDE BRAIN CRAMPS AND SPACE  INVADERS AND FUNKY COLD ANGINA. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR CHEATING  DEATH, BROUGHT TO YOU BY  PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. REMEMBER, WE DON'T TEST ON  ANIMALS. WE MAKE THE ANIMALS TEST ON EACH  OTHER. UNTIL NEXT TIME, I'LL SEE YOU IN  HELL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
