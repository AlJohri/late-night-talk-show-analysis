[APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST IS AN ABC JOURNALIST WHO  HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT TAMING  THE VOICE IN HIS HEAD. LET'S SEE IF HE CAN TAME THE  VOICE IN MY MOUTH. PLEASE WELCOME DAN HARRIS. [APPLAUSE] SIT DOWN, THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE  WHO MAY NOT KNOW THAT YOU'RE  THE EMMY AND AWARD WINNING  JOURNALIST, THE CO-HOST OF  "NIGHTLINE", AND THE WEEKEND  ANCHOR OF GOOD MORNING  AMERICA. YOU REPORTED ON COMBAT FROM  AFGHANISTAN AND MADE SIX TRIPS  TO IRAQ. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED 10%  HAPPIER. HOW I TAMED THE VOICE IN MY  HEAD AND REDUCED STRESS HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS, A TRUE  STORY. I'M AFRAID THAT'S ALL WE HAVE  TIME FOR. THANKS FOR COMING. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: NOW WHAT DOES 10%  HAPPIER MEAN?
WELL, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE RESEARCH OF THIS BOOK  HANGING AROUND WITH SELF-HELP  GURUS WHO SAID YOU COULD SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS THROUGH THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING
Stephen: WHY CAN'T YOU?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. CAN YOU?
Stephen: YES, I'M COOL. I USED TO NOT BE HAPPY ALL THE  TIME, AND THEN I GREW A PAIR  AND MANNED UP. [LAUGHS]
THAT'S AWESOME.
Stephen: MEN TAKE THE BAD FEELINGS AND STUFF IT DOWN  UNTIL OUR HEARTS EXPLODE AT 53.
YOU JUST MADE MY CASE FOR  ME.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE IMPETUS FOR THIS. YOU'D BEEN EMBEDDED WITH THE  TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN. YOU'D BEEN THERE FOR FIRE  FIGHTS. YOU CAME BACK, AND FELT THE  STRESS OF THAT. YOU HAD A PANIC ATTACK ON AIR. WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE? WHAT SHOW WAS IT?
GOOD MORNING AMERICA.
Stephen: YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO  BE HAPPY ON GOOD MORNING  AMERICA.
YES.
Stephen: SO WHAT CAME OVER  YOU?
MY HEART WAS RACING, PALMS  SWEATING, AND I COULDN'T TALK. I WAS HALFWAY THROUGH SIX  STORIES I WAS SUPPOSED TO  READ, AND I HAD TO BAIL AND  SEND IT BACK.
Stephen: YOU WERE  EXPERIMENTING WITH  NON-PRESCRIPTION DRUGS?
YES.
AFTER THE WAR ZONES I GOT  DEPRESSED, AND IN AN ACT OF TOWERING STUPIDITY WAS  EXPERIMENTING WITH COCAINE AND  ECSTASY, WHICH RAISES THE  LEVEL OF ADRENALINE IN THE  BRAIN AND CAUSED A PANIC  ATTACK.
Stephen: ON ECSTASY, DID YOU  HAVE A  PACIFIER IN YOUR MOUTH AND A  GLOW STICKS? WHAT DID YOU THINK -- HOW DID  YOU THINK THAT WOULD HELP.
YOU'RE MAKING ME REALIZE I  DID IT WRONG. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD. OKAY. SO THEN THE LATE GREAT PETER  JENNINGS PUT YOU ON THE RELIGION BEAT AFTER THAT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT RELIGION  HELPED YOU? DID YOU FIND JESUS?
I MET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO  BELIEVE IN JESUS AND WAS MOVED BY THEIR STORYS. NOTHING SPOKE TO ME  PERSONALLY, BUT I DID  ULTIMATELY FIND MEDITATION.
Stephen: WHAT RELIGION DID  YOU FIND MEDITATION?
BUDDHIST MEDITATION.
Stephen: AND WILL THAT  MEDITATION BE SOMETHING THAT  HELPS YOU WHEN YOU'RE  EVENTUALLY SENT TO HELL? [LAUGHTER]  YOU SIT THERE IN THE FIRE LIKE  THIS. IT'S A GOOD START. BUT FOR 10% MORE HAPPINESS,  YOU'RE RISKING AN ETERNITY  OF DAMNATION.
I HESITATED SLIGHTLY ON  THE BUDDHIST THING. THE MEDITATION COMES OUT OF  BUDDHISM, IT CAN CO-EXIST  WITH A BELIEF IN JESUS OR ANY  OR NO FAITH.
Stephen: WHAT IS MEDITATION  SUPPOSED TO DO FOR ME? DOES IT HOLLOW YOU OUT AND  MAKE YOU A SHELL OF A PERSON?
NO. THAT'S THE STEREOTYPE. THAT YOU HAVE TO BE DEEPLY  INTO AROMATHERAPY. SHAVE YOUR HEAD, LIVE  SHOELESS. NOT TRUE AT ALL. IT'S SIMPLE BRAIN EXERCISE. AND THE SUPER POWER IS IT  GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT  RELATIONSHIP TO THE VOICE IN  YOUR HEAD.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  THE VOICE IN YOUR HEAD?
THE INNER ANCHOR MAN  JAMMERING AT YOU ALL DAY, AND  JUDGING, NOT WANTING, CASTING  YOURSELF FORWARD INTO AN  IDEALIZED FUTURE OR  REMEMBERING THE PAST AND NOT  FOCUSING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING
Stephen: I'VE GOT A VOICE  IN MY HEAD AND IT'S TELLING ME  YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT. [ APPLAUSE ]  OKAY SO HOW DO YOU MEDITATE
YOU WANT
Stephen: SURE.
YOU GUYS WANT TO DO THIS TOO? [APPLAUSE]
IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND VERY QUICK. STEP ONE, SIT UP STRAIGHT AND CLOSE YOUR EYES SECOND STEP IS TO NOTICE WHERE  YOU'RE FEELING YOUR BREATH  MOST PROMINENTLY, THE BELLY,  NOSE OR CHEST, AND FEEL THE  BREATH COMING IN AND GOING  OUT, AND EVERY TIME YOUR MIND  WANDERS, WHICH IT WILL, LIKE WHAT AM I GOING TO HAVE  FOR DINNER, AND WHY DID I SAY  THAT TO MY BOSS, JUST CATCH  YOUR WANDERING, AND COME BACK  TO THE BREATH. AND YOU BREAK A LIFETIME OF  HABIT OF WALKING AROUND IN A  DAYDREAM OF FUTURE AND PAST  AND FOCUSING ON WHAT'S  HAPPENING NOW.
Stephen: AND YOU SAY THAT  THIS IS GOING TO GIVE ME A  SUPER POWER?
YES.
Stephen: IT WILL? WILL I HAVE HEAT VISION WHEN I  OPEN MY EYES?
I HOPE NOT.
Stephen: THAT WAS PLEASANT. IS SLEEPING THE SAME AS  MEDITATING, BECAUSE I CAME VERY  CLOSE JUST NOW.
NOT A NEW PROBLEM. FALLING ASLEEP IS SOMETHING  THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE  MEDITATING.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE A NEWSMAN DO I REALLY WANT A NEWSMAN TO BE HAPPY? [LAUGHTER]  BECAUSE THE WORLD IS ROUGH,  AND TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN. DO I WANT A HIPPIE ZEN-LIKE NEWSMAN INTERVIEWING  TERRORISTS SAYING DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BRO, WE'RE ALL ON OUR OWN JOURNEYS
THAT IS TO MISUNDERSTAND  MEDITATION. MEDITATION DOESN'T MAKE YOU  WHERE ANYBODY CAN WALK ALL  OVER YOU. IT ENABLES YOU TO SEE CLEARLY  WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR HEAD.
Stephen: YOU CAN DEFEND  YOURSELF STILL?
ABSOLUTELY. I'M A SMALL MAN, A PUNCH MIGHT  NOT HURT THE ATTACKER, BUT I  CAN DO IT
Stephen: DO YOU FEEL LIKE  THROWING ONE RIGHT NOW?
AT YOU?
YEAH.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE HEAT  VISION.
Stephen: I'LL KEEP MEDITATING AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES DAN HARRIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. DAN HARRIS. [APPLAUSE] 10% HAPPIER. TRY IT.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
