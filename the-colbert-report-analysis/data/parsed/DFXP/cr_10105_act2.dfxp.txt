(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, NATION, I LOVE THE U.S. OF A  AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT. WE INVENTED FLIGHT, WE SEQUENCE DNA. WE PUT CHEESE INSIDE A PIZZA CRUST. BY MANIPULATING THE PIZZA'S DNA. AND ALL THOSE OTHER INNOVATIONS RIGHT THERE HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. THEY ARE PATENTED. PATENTS ARE A FAST TRACK TO MONEY TOWN AFTER THOMAS EDISON PATENTED HIS LIGHT BULB HE WAS ROLLING IN CASH WHICH HE SPENT PERFECTING HIS GREATEST INVENTION, THOMAS'S ENGLISH MUFFINS WHICH OF COURSE STARTED AS A FAILED ATTEMPT AT A PHONOGRAPH RECORD. THE BEST PART IS YOU DON'T NEED TO INVENT THE LIGHT BULB TO RECEIVE A PATENT. BECAUSE THE CASH GENERATING RIGHTS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO SUCH ACTUAL INVENTIONS AS THE NECK FANNIE PACK, THREE LEGGED PANTY HOSE AND THE GERBIL SHIRT. WHICH INNOVATIVELY COMBINES A SHIRT, A GERBIL HABITAT AND BEING ALONE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BEST OF ALL, BEST OF ALL, EVEN IF YOUR INVENTION NEVER MAKES A PENNY, ACCUSING SOMEONE OF STEALING IT CAN. BECAUSE IN 2011 ALONE UNUSED PATENTS GENERATED $29 BILLION IN LAWSUITS, LEGAL FEES AND SETTLEMENTS WORTH TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO IN YOU HAVE AN IDEA, YOU WORK HARD, SOME DAY YOU TOO CAN GET SUED BY SOMEONE WHO HAD A SIMILAR IDEA. AND FOLKS, THE PATENT GAME HAS JUST BEEN ELEVATED TO AN ART FORM BY AMAZON. WHO IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED HAS BEEN GRANTED THE PATENT FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AGAINST A WHITE BACKGROUND. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. AMAZON NOW HAS LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE IDEA OF DISPLAYING A THING. WAIT, WAIT, JIMMY, NO, THAT LOGO IS ON A WHITE BACKGROUND. QUICK, CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING THAT AMAZON WON'T OBJECT TO. THAT'S BETTER OKAY. THAT'S GOOD. NOW THOUGH THAT IS TECHNICALLY STILL WHITE, BECAUSE NOW IF ANYONE DISPLAYS SOMETHING ON A WHITE BACKGROUND AMAZON COULD SERVE THEM WITH A LAWSUIT. WHICH OF COURSE WILL BE DELIVERED IN A MASSIVE BOX THAT IS 90% BUBBLE PACK. AND AMAZON DID A BANG UP JOB OF MAKING THIS IDEA SOUND LIKE A THING THEY HAVE THOUGHT OF, BECAUSE IN THEIR PATENT AMAZON DESCRIBES IN ONE PITHY SENTENCE A BACKGROUND COMPRISING A WHITE CYCLORAMA, A FRONT LIGHT SOURCE POSITIONED IN A LONGITUDINAL ACCESS INTERSECTING THE BACKGROUND AND IMAGE CAPTURE BETWEEN THE BACKGROUND AND FRONT LIGHT SOURCE IN THE LONGITUDINAL ACCESS AND ELEVATED PLATFORM POSITIONED BETWEEN THE IMAGE CAPTURE POSITION AND THE BACKGROUND IN THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS TO THE FRONT LIGHT SOURCE BEING DIRECTED TOWARD A SUBJECT ON THE ELEVATED PLATFORM. NOW I KNOW, I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE BULL [BLEEP], BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MALE BOVINE FECAL MATTER EXTRUDED ON A LONGITUDINAL AXIS. WELL, FOLKS, WELL, FOLKS, I'M SO IMPRESSED BY AMAZON'S STATE OF THE ART CALLING OF DIBS. STEPHEN WANTS IN. TONIGHT I AM OFFICIALLY FILING A PATENT ON THE IDEA OF FILING PATENTS. THE MECHANISM--  (APPLAUSE) THE MECHANISM IS SIMPLE. WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL DROPS OFF A PATENT APPLICATION AT THE PATENT OFFICE, THE SECOND THE PATENT HITS THE DESK THEY ARE IN BREACH OF MY PATENT. AT WHICH POINT THEY GIVE ME MONEY. AFTER THAT--  (APPLAUSE) ONCE I GOT THE GREEN THEN IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW MANY GERBIL SHIRTS AM I GONNA BUY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
