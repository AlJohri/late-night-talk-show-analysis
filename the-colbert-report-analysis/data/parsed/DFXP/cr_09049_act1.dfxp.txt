[EAGLE CAW] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [EAGLE CAW] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OH, NOTHING CAN STOP US NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] WELCOME TO THE BROADCAST  PRESENTED TO YOU TONIGHT IN FULL  COLOR. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, ONCE AGAIN, THE BIG NEWS  COMES FROM WASHINGTON-- AN  ONGOING SCANDAL THREATENS TO ENGULF BARACK OBAMA'S SECOND  TERM.
BIG QUESTIONS FOR BEYONCE.
WAS BEYONCE SINGING LIVE OR  JUST ACTING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM?
LATE TODAY SHOWBIZ TONIGHT  CONFIRMED THAT BEYONCE LIP-  SYNCED THAT INCREDIBLE RENDITION OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON  REGARDING BEYONCEGATE.
ANTHEMGATE.
BEYONCEGATE.
THE LATEST ON BEYONCE'S LIP  GATE.
Stephen: YES LIP-GATE. BEYONCE-GATE. THE CRISIS IN LIP-YA. BEYONC-GAZI. WAS THERE A SECOND SINGER ON THE  GRASSY KNOWLES? [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT. WE HAVE A GRAPHICS PACKAGE AND  EVERYTHING EVENTUALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, IF BEYONCE LIP-SYNCED AT  OBAMA'S INAUGURAL, DO YOU KNOW  WHAT THAT MEANS? IF SO, PLEASE WRITE IN BECAUSE  I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHY I'M SO  ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS COMES AS A HEARTBREAKING  ALLEGATION BECAUSE WE WERE ALL  MOVED BY MS. KNOWLES' PERFORMANCE, NONE MORE SO THAN  JOE BIDEN. ♪ ROCKETS RED GLARE ♪  ♪ THE BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] THAT MAN EITHER LOVES THIS  COUNTRY VERY MUCH, OR CHUCK  SCHUMER JUST RIPPED ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE LED TO  BELIEVE SHE HAD DELIVERED THE  MOST STIRRING RENDITION OF OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM SINCE FRANCIS  SCOTT KEY FIRST SANG IT AT  AMERICA'S ORIGINAL SUPER BOWL, A CAGE FIGHT BETWEEN A BEAR AND A  CHINAMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. LET'S BREAK IT DOWN. LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN. NOW HERE'S THE TIMELINE. LATE MONDAY, SOURCES IN THE  MARINE CORPS BAND, WHO ALLEGEDLY  ACCOMPANIED BEYONCE, LEAKED THE INFORMATION THAT "BEYONCE�  DECIDED SHORTLY BEFORE HER  PERFORMANCE TO RELY ON THE STUDIO VERSION RATHER THAN RISK  SINGING IT LIVE ON THE CAPITOL."  BECAUSE EVIDENTLY, THIS TIME, IT WAS THE JELLY THAT WAS NOT  READY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN, AFTER PRESSURE FROM WE  DON'T KNOW WHERE, THE MARINE  CORPS BAND SUDDENLY RELEASES THIS STATEMENT SAYING "REGARDING  MS. KNOWLES-CARTER'S VOCAL  PERFORMANCE, NO ONE IN THE MARINE BAND IS IN A POSITION TO  ASSESS WHETHER IT WAS LIVE OR  PRERECORDED."  WHEN THOSE MARINES ARE IN THE (bleep) WITH THE TROMBONES AND  THE DRUMS, NO ONE KNOWS WHERE  THE SINGING'S COMING FROM. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED THE FOG OF WARBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN ACCUSATIONS START FLYING  THAT THE MARINE CORPS BAND  "WASN'T ACTUALLY PLAYING DURING THE SONG."  OH, SO NOW WE CAN'T TRUST THE  MARINES?! WHAT DOES THIS UNDERMINE OUR  FAITH IN THE MILITARY? DO WE HAVE A PROPER CHAIN OF  COMMAND? ARE WE REALLY EVEN AT WAR IN  AFGHANISTAN? [ LAUGHTER ] OR ARE WE JUST LIP SYNCHING TO  AN OLD RECORDING OF VIETNAM? [ LAUGHTER ] MR. PRESIDENT  MR. PRESIDENT, THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE DEMAND ANSWERS:  --  WHAT DID BEYONCE SING, AND WHEN DID SHE SING IT? AND IS THAT EVEN BEYONCE? IT COULD HAVE BEEN SASHA FIERCE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO FAR, FOLKS, IN RESPONSE TO  THIS GROWING SCANDAL, BEYONCE  HAS HAD  "NO COMMENT." THOUGH AT THIS POINT WE DON'T  KNOW IF THAT'S "HER" NOT  COMMENTING OR WHETHER SHE WAS JUST "NOT MOVING" HER LIPS TO A  PRE-RECORDED SILENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] EITHER WAY, IT'S OFFICIAL:  JAY-Z NOW HAS 100 PROBLEMS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT GUY KNOW WHAT'S I'M TALKING  ABOUT RIGHT THERE. FOLKS, I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW  EVERYTHING. 'CUZ I DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, OBAMA'S PLAN TO KEEP OUR  KIDS SAFE IS LAUGHABLY  INSUFFICIENT. LUCKILY, ONE RURAL TOWN IN OHIO  HAS COME UP WITH A COMMON-SENSE  SOLUTION.
THERE'S ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT  IN OHIO , THEY HAVE A NEW PLAN,  AND THAT IS TO ARM NON-TEACHING EMPLOYEES, BASICALLY THE  JANITORS AND CUSTODIANS.
Stephen: YES, JANITORS AND  CUSTODIANS. IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE HE DOES NOT SPEND FOUR  YEARS EARNING HIS PH.D. IN  CUSTODIAL SCIENCE TO BE MISTAKEN FOR SOME NUMB-NUT JANITOR. [ LAUGHTER ] POINT IS, THEY'LL BOTH HAVE  GUNS, AND BE ABLE TO STOP ANY  MADMAN-- AS SOON AS THEY FIND THE RIGHT WEAPON ON THEIR GUN  RING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT  TO THE MONTPELIER, OHIO, SCHOOL  DISTRICT. JANITORS ARE THE LOGICAL CHOICE  TO PROTECT OUR SCHOOLS. AS ONE SUPPORTER WROTE TO THE  THE LIMA, OHIO NEWS, QUOTE:  "WHY THE CUSTODIAN? THE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS. THEY DO NOT HAVE A CLASSROOM  FULL OF CHILDREN AS THEIR FIRST  RESPONSIBILITY AS TEACHERS DO. AND UNLIKE THE ADMINISTRATORS,  THEY ARE NOT NEEDED FOR QUICK  DECISIONS." [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YES, THESE ARE THE  GUYS WE DON'T TRUST WITH ANY  RESPONSIBILITY. LET'S GIVE THEM THE GUNS! AND THEY'RE NOT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEY'RE NOT JUST HANDING  WEAPONS TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW  WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THE JANITORS ARE GETTING "A  TWO-DAY TRAINING CLASS, "WHICH  MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH, BUT COME ON, THEY'RE LEARNING TO  FIRE A GUN, NOT REFILL A PAPER  TOWEL DISPENSER. WHRF LF. [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT, IT CAN BE HARD FOR  LIBERTARIANS TO FIND TRUE LOVE. WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF  MY HAT TO theatlasphere.com, A  DATING SITE INSPIRED BY THE WORK OF PHILOSOPHER AND FORGOTTEN  MEMBER OF THE MUNSTERS, AYN  RAND. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ATLASPHERE IS DEDICATED TO  "CONNECTING ADMIRERS OF THE  FOUNTAINHEAD AND ATLAS SHRUGGED," BECAUSE NOTHING LEADS  TO PILLOW TALK LIKE TALKING  ABOUT BOOKS THE SIZE OF PILLOWS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AYN RAND KNOWS ABOUT MATTERS  OF THE HEART. JUST LISTEN TO HER 1959  SEDUCTION OF MIKE WALLACE.
EVERY IMPORTANT MORAL LEADER  IN MAN'S HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US  THAT WE SHOULD LOVE ONE ANOTHER. WHY THEN IS THIS KIND OF LOVE IN  YOUR MIND IMMORAL?
IT IS IMMORAL IF IT IS A LOVE  PLACED ABOVE ONESELF.
IF A MAN IS WEAK OR A WOMAN  IS WEAK, THAN HE OR SHE IS  BEYOND LOVE?
HE CERTAINLY DOESN'T DESERVE  IT. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Stephen: HOW DID HE NOT JUMP  HER BONES? [ LAUGHTER ] Atlasphere.com IS THE BEST PLACE  FOR RANDIANS TO FIND THE ONE  THEY LOVE, OTHER THAN THEIR BATHROOM MIRROR. [ LAUGHTER ] JUST LOOK AT SOME OF THE  LOVELORN OBJECTIVISTS WHO ARE  ALREADY ON THE SITE. LADIES, HERE'S ELIGIBLE BACHELOR  "PIKEY PETE," WHOSE PROFILE  SIMPLY READS "I AM ME. THAT IS ALL THAT SHOULD BE  SAID." [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN LOOK FORWARD TO YEARS OF  SPARKLING DINNER CONVERSATION. "STEAK IS ENTREE. THAT IS ALL THAT SHOULD BE  EATEN." [ LAUGHTER ] AND DON'T WORRY, GUYS. THE ATLASPHERE IS ALSO FULL OF  INDUSTRIOUS WOMEN. LIKE "MYOSOTIS," A 28-YEAR-OLD  YOUNG WOMAN WHO HUMBLY STATES  "I AM AMAZING. I AM DEEPLY INTERESTED IN  WHATEVER I AM INTERESTED IN,  WHENEVER I AM INTERESTED IN IT." [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO FELLAS, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED  IN HER, THAT IS SOMETHING YOU  WILL HAVE IN COMMON. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ROMANCE-MINDED OBJECTIVISTS,  LOG ONTO theatlasphere.com AND  FIND A LOVE THAT LASTS FOREVER, OR UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHICH  ONE OF YOU IS THE PARASITE. [ LAUGHTER ] FINALLY, I'M NO FAN OF SNAKES. ANYTHING THAT HUGS SOMETHING TO  DEATH HAS MOMMY ISSUES. SEE A THERAPIST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I'M NOT THE ONLY SNAKE-HATER  OUT THERE. FOR MORE WE TURN TO FOX NEWS'  RESIDENT MONGOOSE, SHEP SMITH.
SOUTH FLORIDA HAS A SNAKE  PROBLEM, SPECIFICALLY A PYTHON  PROBLEM. WILDLIFE EXPERTS SAY AS MANY AS  150,000 BURMESE PYTHONS ARE  SLITHERING AROUND IN THE FLORIDA  EVERGLADES.
Stephen: THE PROBLEM STEMMED  FROM PEOPLE IMPORTING THESE  SOUTH ASIAN MONSTERS AS EXOTIC PETS, AND THEN LETTING THEM  ESCAPE. AND I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT  TO FLORIDA OFFICIALS FOR COMING  UP WITH A PLAN.
STATE OFFICIALS HAVE  ORGANIZED THE 2013 PYTHON  CHALLENGE. BAG A PYTHON, YOU COULD POCKET A  REWARD OF A THOUSAND BUCKS.
Stephen: A THOUSAND BUCKS. WITH THAT KIND OF MONEY, YOU  COULD GET SOMETHING COOL, LIKE A  PET PYTHON. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU GET BORED WITH IT, JUST  LET IT GO. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW THERE ARE RULES. >>EITHER SHOOT IT ONCE IN THE  HEAD OR USE A MACHETE AND CHOP  ITS HEAD OFF. ANY PYTHON MORE THAN TWO PIECES  WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR PRIZES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: VERY IMPORTANT. VERY IMPORTANT. NO MORE THAN TWO PIECES OF SNAKE  WILL BE ACCEPTED. SO DON'T COME IN TRYING TO PASS  OFF YOUR OLD SNAKE CHUNKS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND FLORIDA RESIDENTS, PLEASE BE  CAREFUL. IT'S EASY TO THINK YOU'VE BAGGED  A 6-FOOT ALBINO BURMESE, WHEN IN  FACT YOU'VE CAPTURED FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE
