(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS TOM HANKS. PLEASE WELCOME TOM HANKS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, TOM! GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, THANKS FOR COMING BACK. ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE YOU IN THE HOUSE.
ALWAYS GOOD TO BE HERE, STEPHEN.
Stephen: TOM, BEFORE WE GET STARTED, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR NEW MOVIE "CAPTAIN PHILLIPS."
OKAY.
YOU HAD A PLAN, CAPTAIN, YOU HAD A PLAN TO TAKE MY SHIP AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO YOUR BUDDY COULD TAKE ME AND MAKE A RUN TO SOMALIA? YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE UP. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP.
I CAN'T STOP!
THE NAVY IS NOT GOING TO LET YOU WIN. THEY CAN'T LET YOU WIN. THEY WOULD RATHER SINK THIS BOAT THAN LET YOU GET ME BACK TO SOMALIA. IT'S OVER!
I COME TOO FAR. I CAN'T GIVE UP. NO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, WHICH ONE WERE YOU IN THAT SCENE? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE YOU'RE THAT GOOD.
I WAS THE ONE STEERING THE LIFEBOAT. LIKE THIS THROUGHOUT.
Stephen: YOU GREW A GOATEE FOR THIS FILM.
IS THAT A GOATEE? IT IS A VAN DYKE?
Stephen: IT COULD BE.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS.
Stephen: YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR EVIL TWIN A LITTLE BIT. ARE YOU A GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY IN THIS MOVIE?
I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR THE SROBGS POP LIE TO DECIDE.
Stephen: REALLY? IT'S POSSIBLE YOU'RE A BAD GUY IN THE MOVIE?
IS IT A DERIG GOURE THAT IF YOU HAVE A GOATEE YOU HAVE BEEN CLONED AND YOU ARE A LESSER VERSION OF YOURSELF AND ARE, IN FACT, THE EVIL SPOT WITH A MORE DEFINED CHIN AND A LITTLE BETTER JAW MUSCLE? THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU GROW ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
Stephen: IT DOES SOMETHING TO YOUR MUSCLES? IT TOOK MUSCLES FOR YOU TO GROW A BEARD? (LAUGHTER)
LISTEN, I HAD TO DYE THOSE HAIRS GRAY FOR SO MANY HOURS THAT I DON'T EVEN -- (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: NOW, THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT PIRATES.
HIJACKERS, PIRATES, YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
PIRATES HAVE TRICORNER HATS. (LAUGHTER) AND MUCH GOOFIER SHIRTS.
Stephen: FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR JOHNNY DEPP PIRATE.
LITTLE DIFFERENT.
Stephen: THESE ARE SOMALI PIRATES.
THESE ARE SOMALI ROBBERS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO STEAL THE SHIP SO THEY CAN GET MONEY, BECOME RICH, GET CHICKS, BUY CARS AND NOT BE KILLED BY THE WAR LORDS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY FORCING THEM TO DO THIS FOR A LIVING.
Stephen: NOW DOES THIS MOVIE HAVE A SOCIAL CONSCIENCE, A LOT OF MOVIES YOU'VE DONE-- ESPECIALLY BIG OSCAR WINNERS-- HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S HEARTS AND MINDS. ANY CHANCES THIS GOING TO CHANGE THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF PEOPLE IN SHOL YA ABOUT PIRATING?
I THINK FOR THE MUSICAL NUMBERS. THROUGH SOME OF THE SONGS AND DANCES IT MIGHT. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: REALLY? â™ª HI DIDLLEY DEE
PAUL GREEN GRASS, "UNITED 93" THE BOURNE FILMS "BLOODY SUNDAY" HE GOES OFF AND CAPTURED AN ASPECT OF SOMALIA THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE STANDARD VERSION OF WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSUME WOULD BE VERY EASY BAD GUYS TO HATE. IT'S A WAR-TORN PLACE OF CORRUPTION AND HOPELESSNESS AND WHAT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN A YOUNG MAN WITH A GUN AND WITH NOTHING TO LOSE? THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE STATURE OF THE FOUR GUYS THAT HIJACKED THIS SHIP.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY SHOT THIS ON --
ON FILM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: ON FILM. GOOD.
YES, WE DID, SIR.
Stephen: (LAUGHS) A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING MOVIES WITH JUST SKETCH ARTISTS. BUT YOU DID IT ON ONE OF THE BIG PHAERSING SHIPS, RIGHT?
OFF OF MALTA IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.
LIKE 650 FOOT VESSELS.
I THINK IT'S LIKE 533 BUT STACKED WITH ALL THE CARGO, AND THEY HAD TO DO THAT SPECIFICALLY.
Stephen: THESE GUYS JUST COME OUT AND ESSENTIALLY LIKE A BOSTON WHALER.
THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED PRIOR TO 2009 BECAUSE THE SHIPS ARE -- CAN GO FAR, RELATIVELY FAST, AND HAVE VERY HIGH HULLS AND PIRATES, HIJACKERS, COULD NOT GET ON BOARD EXCEPT FOR THESE GUYS WITH THE WENT TO HOME DEPOT AND BOUGHT A LADDER. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: REALLY? THEY HAVE ACHIEVED LADDER TECHNOLOGY IN SOMALIA?
THEY HAVE. THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT HERE'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU GUYS -- THE ORIGINAL CAPTAIN, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, THEY USED HOSES TO TRY TO -- LIKE LITERALLY LIKE FIRE HOSES TO BLOW THEM OFF.
YES.
Stephen: THIS IS AN ENORMOUS BOAT WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF CARGO.
PEANUTS, TENNIS SHOES, B.M.W. s, T.V.s. .
Stephen: THEY CAN'T AFFORD A SINGLE GUN? THERE ARE NO GUNS ON THE SHIP. THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED. THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED AT THE TIME BY INTERNATIONAL LAW. YOU CANNOT BRING FIREARMS INTO AN INTERNATIONAL PORT ON A COMMERCIAL CARGO VESSEL.
Stephen: THERE'S NO SECOND AMENDMENT AT SEA. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, THERE IS IN SOMALIA WHERE EVERYBODY HAS A GUN.
Stephen: AS THE STAR OF THE MOVIE, HOW LONG DID YOU SPEND GOING OUT TO SEA ON THIS SHIP?
EVERYDAY.
Stephen: STPHOUPBG.
OH, FROM DAWN TO DUSK.
Stephen: HOW MANY DAYS? (LAUGHTER) IS THERE SOME SECRET HERE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SNOW THERE'S A TWO-MONTH GAP IN YOUR LIFE YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT ON MALTA.
I'M GONNA SAY TWO MONTHS, YOU KNOW. BETTER PART OF TEN WEEKS.
Stephen: A GUY LIKE YOU AT THIS POINT, CAN'T YOU GO TO SOME BIG GREEN SOUND STAGE AND POINT AT TENNIS BALLS GLUED TO THE WALL AND SAY "LOOK, PIRATES, THEY'RE COMING!"
IN FACT, THERE'S A CD-ROM OF ALL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. YOU ENTER INTO THE CODE AND MY HANDS WILL MOVE ANY WAY YOU WANT ME TO, MY EYES WITH WELL YOU HAVE WITH TEARS AT THE PUNCH OF A BUTTON.
Stephen: CAN I GET THAT? (LAUGHTER) I'VE GOT SOME MOVIES I'D LIKE TO PUT TOM HANKS IN. WOULD YOU RATHER DO SOMETHING FICTION OR NONFICTION? I WAS WATCHING IT WITH SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ALE A REAL STORY.
I'D LIKE -- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN NONFICTION. I STARTED READING IT VERY YOUNG AND I THOUGHT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED BY AND LARGE IS MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY. EVEN, LIKE, READING LIKE FICTION BOOKS BUT SET IN NONFICTION AREAS LIKE "IN COLD BLOOD" OR LEON YOU ARE REUS NOVELS.
Stephen: THE DA VINCI CODE." RIPPED RIGHT OUT OF THE DAY'S REALITIES. YOU TAKE A MAP AROUND, YOU'VE GOT DA VINCI CODE. THAT'S ALL YOU NEED.
Stephen: WHEN YOU GO TO ROME DO PEOPLE IN CHURCHES GO "PLEASE GET OUT"? (LAUGHTER) WELL, TOM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. TOM HANKS, THE MOVIE IS "CAPTAIN PHILLIPS." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND
