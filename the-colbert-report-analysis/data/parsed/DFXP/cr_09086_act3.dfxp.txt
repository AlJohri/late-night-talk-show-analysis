Colbert: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK  OF POETRY YOU SHOULD MEMORIZE. IT'S CALLED... I DON'T KNOW. I'LL ASK HER. PLEASE WELCOME CAROLINE KENNEDY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD. Colbert: GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN
THANK YOU  Colbert: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? VERY WELL  Colbert: YOU'RE THE AUTHOR  AND EDITOR OF TEN BOOKS ON  AMERICAN HISTORY, POLITICS, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND POETRY:  YOU GOT ANOTHER POETRY BOOK  HERE. IT'S CALLED "POEMS TO LEARN BY  HEART."
THAT'S RIGHT  Colbert: WHY ARE YOU SO ON TO  POETRY? DO WE NEED IT ANYMORE? WE HAVE TWITTER. IT'S SHORTER, YOU KNOW, BETTER  GRAMMAR THAN E.E. CUMMINGS
GIRLS LOVE POETRY  Colbert: THEY DO? YES, THEY DO  Colbert: I KNOW THEY LIKE THE  CHOCOLATE AND THE FLOWERS. IF YOU BREAK OUT A HICKORY DICK  ORE DOCK
NOT LIKE THAT, NO, NO. NOT LIKE THAT EGG THING, NO.
Colbert: THE EGG THING? BY THE WAY, THANK YOU FOR BEING  HERE ON THE NIGHT THAT I ATE AN  EGG RIGHT OUT OF A CHICKEN'S  BUTT. WHAT GOOD IS POETRY?
POETRY IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE  HUMAN HEART. IT CAN HELP US LIVE OUR LIVES. IT ENRICHES OUR LIVES. IT MAKES EVERYTHING MORE  INTENSE. EVERYTHING. AND I MEAN EVERYTHING.
Colbert: REALLY? YES  Colbert: BUT WHY MEMORIZE IT? I CAN UNDERSTAND BUYING THE  BOOK. YOU HAVE A BOOK FULL OF POETRY  HERE. BUT WHY WOULD I MEMORIZE THIS  BOOK? WHY WOULD YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE  TO STEAL YOUR BOOK WITH THEIR  MINDS?
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT... SO YOU  CAN HAVE IT WITH YOU AND STILL  GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU  LOVE. IT JUST MAKES EVERYTHING THAT  YOU DO MORE INTERESTING. IT MAKES YOU SMARTER. I MEAN, DO YOU LIKE TO PRACTICE  SPORTS? DO YOU LIKE TO... NO? WELL, DO YOU LIKE TO PRACTICE  PRAYING?
Colbert: YEAH, I DO. I PRACTICE PRAYING. CAN PRAYER BE A POEM?
IT CAN  Colbert: CAN POEMS BE A  PRAYER?
YES, THEY CAN. Colbert: OKAY. I'VE GOT A BEEF WITH YOU.
OKAY  Colbert: YOU HAVE THE  GETTYSBURG ADDRESS IN HERE AS A  POEM. THAT'S NOT A POEM.
IT'S POETIC. Colbert: THAT'S A SPEECH. BUT THERE'S NO RHYME IN IT.
IT INSPIRES US  Colbert: OF THE PEOPLE BY THE  PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T  RHYME PEOPLE WITH PEOPLE
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TOO BAD
Colbert: DO YOU TAKE YOUR OWN  ADVICE, PHYSICIAN
WHAT  Colbert: DO YOU MEMORIZE YOUR  OWN POETRY?
NOT MY OWN BUT I MEMORIZE  OTHER POEMS. I DO
Colbert: CRACK ONE OPEN RIGHT  NOW. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? ONE STANDS A. JUST ONE STANDS A. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. DON'T DO A LONG ONE
YOU CAN DO THAT. Colbert: ONE STANZ  HAPPILY ONWARD INTO THE  VALLEY OF DEATH. (QUOTING POETRY TO EACH OTHER)
DOWN TO A SUN LIT SEA. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO DRINK THE  MILK OF PARADISE?
Colbert: WITH BURBON. SLENDER AS A WILLOW WAND, OWE  CLEARER THAN CLEAR WATER, OWE  REED BY THE LIVING POOL FAIR RIVER DAUGHTER SPRINGTIME AND  SUMMERTIME AND SPRING AGAIN  AFTER, OH, WIND ON THE WATERFALL AND THE LEAVES' LAUGHTER
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. SO MUCH DEPENDS ON OUR RED WHEEL  BEAR OWE GLAZED WITH RAIN WATER  BESIDE THE WHITE CHICKENS
Colbert: YOU NEED NOT BE SO  SPRY CONCERNING MATTERS ARTY. EACH TO HIS PACE BUT AS FOR I I  LIKE A CERTAIN PARTY. I'LL TAKE THE SOLID BLISS. FOR WHOSE IDEAS I'LL MATCH YOU,  A PRETTY GIRL WHOSE NAKED IS, IS  WORTH A MILLION STATUES.
ALL HIS FRIENDS WERE THERE. Colbert: SURE. THEY ALL WENT OUT FOR AIR. Colbert: THAT WAS E.E. CUMMINGS. MINE WAS E.E. CUMMINGS.
OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO WORK  ON IT.
Colbert: WHAT WORRIES ME  ABOUT THIS IS THAT, A, I DON'T  HAVE ROOM IN MY HEAD FOR ANYTHING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S  ALL FULL OF PASSWORDS I NEED FOR  ONLINE.
THAT'S TRUE. Colbert: COMPLETELY FILLED  UP.
POETRY CAN BE YOUR PASSWORD  Colbert: ACTUALLY I HAVE A  POEM THAT HELPS ME REMEMBER MY  PASSWORD. TWO ROADS DIVERGE IN A YELLOW  WOOD AND THEN THREE ROADS  DIVERGE AND THEN SEVEN ROADS AND THEN TWO ROADS AGAIN. AND THAT HAS MADE ALL THE PIN  CODE.
THAT'S GOOD. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MAKE A  NEW ONE NOW THAT YOU TOLD  EVERYONE
Colbert: CAN I TALK ABOUT  HOMER WITH YOU FOR A SECOND
SURE  Colbert: YOU KNOW WHO HOMER  WAS, RIGHT?
OKAY  Colbert: BEFORE THERE WERE  BOOKS THIS IS WHY I DON'T  UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD SELL A BOOK THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO  MEMORIZE THINGS BECAUSE BEFORE  THERE WERE BOOKS THERE WAS THE ORAL TRADITION. WE DIDN'T NEED BOOKS
NO. NOW WE HAVE THEM
Colbert: HOMER WOULD COME  OVER TO YOUR HOUSE FOR LIKE 24  HOURS TO RECITE THE ILIAD AND THE ODYSSEY. YOU COULDN'T ASK HIM TO LEAVE  BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND. AND THAT WOULD BE CREEPY. YOU KNOW, YOU'D SEEM LIKE A JERK
WELL, YOU COULD LEAVE AND  LEAVE HIM THERE. HE WAS BLIND SO HE WOULDN'T SEE  YOU.
Colbert: THAT'S HOW YOU  LEAVE. AMAZING. CAROLINE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CAROLINE KENNEDY. POEMS TO LEARN BY HEART. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
