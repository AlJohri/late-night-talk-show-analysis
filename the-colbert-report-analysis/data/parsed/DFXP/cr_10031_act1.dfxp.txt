Stephen: WHOOO! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. YEAH, I LIKE IT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S EPISODE OF THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO YOU HAVE IN THERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, FOLKS. HI AM SO GLAD TO BE ALIVE. WHAT A TIME TO BE IN THE NEWS BIZ. I MEAN BETWEEN THE HOLIDAYS, COME ON. EVENTS ARE UNFOLDING ALL OVER VARIOUS PLACES. YESTERDAY FOX NEWS'S THE FIVE HELD A ROUND TABLE ON A HOUSTON SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR WHO SAID ITS STUDENTS DRESSED LIKE HOES. AND OVER ON CNN JAKE TAPPER'S LEAD STORY WAS ABOUT DOING BOB DYLAN FOR SOMETHING HE SAID TWO YEARS AGO. SO THOSE STORIES ARE COVERED. AND YOU KNOW WHERE THINGS ARE ALWAYS HAPPENING?
WASHINGTON D.C. WHERE CONGRESS ONLY HAS TEN WORKDAYS LEFT. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A FLURRY OF ACTIVITY AS THEY PACK FOR VACATION. BECAUSE, FOLKS, THIS CONGRESS HAS EARNED A VERY SPECIAL DISTINCTION.
THE 113th CONGRESS IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN AS THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE IN OUR AMERICAN HISTORY.
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT ONLY 55 BILLS HAVE BEEN SIGN MOOD LAW THIS YEAR, THAT MAKES THIS THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS EVER.
THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS IN THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC.
IT LITERALLY IS A DO-NOTHING CONGRESS.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NOT FAIR. THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING. THEY'RE GETTING INTO THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS. AND FOLKS, THAT MAKES IT TWICE, IF YOU COUNT JOHN BOEHNER'S FINGERNAILS. NOW IT'S NOT EASY. NOW SURE, THE 113th HASN'T PASSED A BILLS EVERY CONGRESS DOES LIKE A HIGHWAY BILL OR DEFENSE BILL OR FARM BILL OR A BUDGET. BUT I MEAN WHAT DO WE NEED A BUDGET FOR. CLEARLY NOT FOR HIGHWAYS, DEFENSE. OR FOOD, THEY DID PASS A BILL ENSURING PEOPLE CAN FISH ON DAMS NEAR THE CUMBERLAND RIVER AND PASSED DEEP CUTS IN FOOD STAMPS FOR THE POOR WHICH IS GOOD SOLID GOVERNING BECAUSE THE POOR DON'T NEED FOOD STAMPS ANY MORE NOW THAT THEY CAN FISH NEAR DAMS ON THE CUMBERLAND RIVER. REMEMBER, REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING, GIVE A MAN A FISH WILL EAT FOR A DAY. TAKE AWAY HIS FOOD STAMPS, MAYBE HE WON'T. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, I'M EXCITED-- I'M SO EXCITED TO HAVE OTHERS REPORT THAT THERE'S BEEN AN EVEN BIGGER BIPARTISAN ACHIEVEMENT.
CONGRESS IS ABOUT TO SHELL OUT $55 MILLION TO PAY FOR RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR A GROUP OF CHIMPANZEES. THE 300 CHIMPS ARE PART OF A RESEARCH TESTING FACILITY WHO ARE BEING SENT TO A HABITAT IN LOUISIANA TO LIVE OUT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. THE MONEY WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE ANIMALS WITH HOUSING, FOOD AND MEDICAL CARE.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THE GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR RESEARCH CHIMPS TO RETIRE TO LOUISIANA. BECAUSE NOT EVEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY SCARRED APRILS WANT TO LIVE IN FLOOR-- AIRPORTS WANT TO LIVE IN FLORIDA. NATION--  (APPLAUSE) BIG SUNSHINE STATE FANS TONIGHT. NATION, THIS IS GREAT NEWS. BECAUSE IT MEANS CONGRESS CAN AGREE ON A SOCIAL SAFETY NET AS LONG AS IT'S NOT FOR HUMAN BEINGS. AND IF THEY'RE WILLING TO REWARD RESEARCH CHIMPS WITH CURBY RETIREMENT, I SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULDN'T JUST OFFER THE SAME DEAL TO OUR ELDERLY. AS LONG AS WE CAN USE THEM FOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS FIRST. FACE IT, COME ON, FACE IT. THEY ALREADY SWALLOW WHATEVER PILLS YOU PUT IN THE TRAY. AND SINCE WE WON'T NEED CHIMPS FOR RESEARCH ANY MORE, WE CAN HAVE THEM DO ALL THE THINGS CONGRESS REFUSES TO PAY PEOPLE TO DO. LIKE REBUILDING OUR BRIDGES OR PAVING OUR HIGHWAYS. I MEAN IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER BECAUSE A CHIMP ON A TRICYCLE IS FUNNY BUT A CHIMP ON A STEAMROLLER, HILARIOUS. COME TO THINK OF IT, WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT THE CHIMPS IN CONGRESS. AFTER ALL, THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- THEY'VE GOT THE EXPERIENCE YOU NEED. THEY JERK OFF IN PUBLIC AND THROW [BLEEP] AT EACH OTHER. FOLKS, WHAT A HAPPY, WONDERFUL, ATTRACTIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE. FOLKS, SOME PEOPLE SEE THE GRASS AS HALF EMPTY. I SEE THE GRASS AS HALF FULL. OF URINE, UNFORTUNATELY. BUT THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN A QUALITY EDUCATION. EXCEPT PERHAPS A QUANTITY EDUCATION WHICH IS DR.I WENT TO THE 6th GRADE THREE TIMES IN A ROW. HANG IN THERE, BUDDY, IT GETS BETTER. NOW I'M NO FAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT I DO LIKE THEIR NEW COMMON CORE STANDARDS.
WHICH ARE GOING TO BE LESS EMPHASIS ON READING LITERATURE AND MORE ON READING MEMOS AND INSTRUCTION MANUALS. SO I WAS READY TO GIVE THE COMMON CORE AN F FOR FANTASTIC. THEN I SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE ME CHANGE THAT TO AN A FOR ANGRY. JIM?
45 STATES ADOPTING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S COMMON CORE CURRICULUM WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT CURSIVE BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL.
THERE ARE MANY CHILDREN TODAY WHO CAN'T EVEN READ CURSIVE WRITING LET ALONE WRITE IT.
Stephen: WRITTEN OFF.
CURSIVE WRITING IS NO LONGER PART OF WHAT IS CALLED QUOTE, UNQUOTE, THE COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS. THIS MEANS THAT CURSIVE IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED A CORE SKILL THAT YOUNGSTERS MUST LEARN.
Stephen: NATION, THAT CRANKY RAISIN IS RIGHT. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS WAGING A WAR ON CURSIVE, OR POSSIBLY A WAYNE ON LURSIVE, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL. DIDN'T QUITE FINISH THAT THERE. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP OF THE HAT TO THE PENMANSHIP PATRIOTS OVER AT THE CAMPAIGN FOR CURSIVE WHOSE LOGO IS, NATURALLY, A DISEMBODIED HUMAN BRAIN WITH EYES AND A MOUTH GIVING A THUMBS UP SAYING CURSIVE IS COOL. IT IS EASY TO REMEMBER BECAUSE IT WILL HAUNT YOUR DREAMS. AS HANDWRITING TEACHER JAN OLSON POINTS OUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS TO KEEP CURSIVE AROUND.
CURSIVE IS THE FLUID STYLE OF WRITING. THE CONNECTIONS MAKES THE LETTERS FLOW TOGETHER AND IT IS ACTUALLY FASTER FOR STUDENTS TO WRITE AND GET THEIR THOUGHTS DOWN ON PAPER.
Stephen: YES, IT IS SO MUCH FASTER. I MEAN LOOK HOW QUICKLY THAT CHILD WROTE A-R. SHE-- THINK ABOUT IT. THAT WAS LIKE-- 11 SECONDS. AND NOW SHE'S ALMOST A THIRD OF THE WAY THROUGH ARDUOUS. (LAUGHTER) PLUS AS MASTER PENMAN MICHAEL SULL EXPLAINS CURSIVE CONNECTS KID TO OUR NATION'S HISTORY SAYING THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO READ THE CONSTITUTION, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OR ANYTHING WRITTEN DURING THE CIVIL WAR. GREAT, NOW THOSE NATIONAL TREASURE MOVIES WON'T MAKE ANY SENSE. SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, CAMPAIGN FOR CURSIVE. AND BE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT, IMPARTIAL AND COMPLETELY OBJECTIVE GROUP BEHIND THE CAMPAIGN, THE AMERICAN HANDWRITING ANALYSIS FOUNDATION WHOSE LOGO, AS YOU CAN SEE, IS NOT IN CURSIVE. LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE ALREADY LOST, FOLKS. THE HANDWRITING'S ON THE WALL. AND NO ONE CAN READ IT. NEXT UP ON THE TIP WAG, WAG, WAG, I'M TIRED OF CONSERVATIVES BEING ACCUSED OF BEING INSENSITIVE TO BLACK PEOPLE. WE GET IT. NOW I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW OVER THIS BREAK I WATCHED ALL OF ROOTS PERFORMING ON JIMMY FALLON. REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THE CRUELTY OF JIMMY FALLON. WELL, FOLKS, ON SUNDAY REPUBLICANS PROVED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT THEY ARE SENSITIVE TO THE BLACK EXPERIENCE BY COMMEMORATING THE 58th ANNIVERSARY OF ROSA PARK'S COURAGEOUS BUS PROTEST. THE RNC TOOK TO TWITTER SAYING TODAY WE REMEMBER ROSA PARK'S BOLD STAND AND HER ROLE IN ENDING RACISM. NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING. S THIS'S NOT RIGHT. IT WAS REALLY MORE OF A BOLD SIT. FOLKS, I'VE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF ROSA PARKS. I DON'T GET WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS I REFUSE TO GIVE UP MY SEAT ALL THE TIME. I DON'T STAND UP FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, THE ELDERLY OR EVEN FOR ROSA PARKS. I STOLE HER SEAT AT A BENEFIT TO SIT CLOSER TO OPRAH. I SAY YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSE ROSIE. I--  (APPLAUSE) I DON'T WANT TO TOOT MY OWN HORN BUT I AM THE ROSA PARKS OF NOT GIVING UP MY SEAT FOR ROSA PARKS. NEVERTHELESS, I AM GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO THE RNC FOR REMINDING EVERYONE THAT ROSA PARKS ENDED RACISM. THE MOMENT SHE REFUSED TO GET UP FROM HER SEAT IN DECEMBER OF 1955 RACISM WAS OVER. THE END FADE TO BLACK. OR FADE TO CHINESE, WHATEVER. IT'S ALL THE SAME NOW. SO BRAVO, RNC, FOR FINALLY GIVING PROPER CREDIT TO ROSA PARKS. AND IF ANYONE OUT THERE DOES NOT AGREE THAT SHE DESERVES IT, THEN YOU'RE A RACIST WHICH YOU CANNOT BE THANKS TO ROSA PARKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
