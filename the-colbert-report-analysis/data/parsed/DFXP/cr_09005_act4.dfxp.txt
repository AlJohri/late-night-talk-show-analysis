Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, BEFORE WE GO I AM  PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THE LATEST  EDITION TO THE COLD BETTER  REPORT FAMILY, BEATRICE HELEN, BORN TO MY WRITER  MIKE AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE ON  MONDAY. REMEMBER, MIKE, SINCE THIS  IS YOUR SECOND CHILD, YOU  GET HALF AS MUCH PATENT  LEAVE. BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW  TO BE A FATHER. THIRD THROUGH 7th KIDS MUST  BE DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE,  CHECK YOUR CONTRACT. AND WHAT DID HE DO DURING  HIS FIRST DAY WITH HIS  PRECIOUS NEW DAUGHTER? HE TEXTED ME A PITCH, QUOTE  GREAT ARTICLE IN TIMES ON  PAGE A-11 ABOUT COWS SEXTING,  COULD BE A THREAT. THANKS, MIKE. (APPLAUSE)  THANKS, MIKE. I PROMISE I WON'T TELL YOUR  WIFE YOU DID THAT. SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE  WHOLE FAMILY. HERE'S A LITTLE  ENTERTAINMENT--   (LAUGHTER)  MIKE LOVES IT THAT. GOOD NIGHT.
