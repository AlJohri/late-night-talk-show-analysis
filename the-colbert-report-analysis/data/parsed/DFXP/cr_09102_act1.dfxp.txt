Stephen: TONIGHT CAN  CONGRESS REACH A COMPROMISE  ON IMMIGRATION REFORM? OR IS PASSING LEGISLATION  JUST A JOB AMERICANS DON'T  WANT TO DO? (LAUGHTER)  THEN WHAT'S IN THE LATEST  ISSUE OF MAXIM, SAME AS  EVERY ISSUE, PORNOGRAPHY FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T TAKE  NUDITY. AND MY GUEST DAN BROWN IS  THE BEST SELLING AUTHOR OF  THE "DA VINCI CODE" AND  ANGELS & DEMONS. I WANTED TO INTERVIEW HIM ON  THE BEACH THIS SUMMER. BUSINESS NETWORKING SITED  LINKEDIN IS CRACKING DOWN ON  PROSTITUTES AM NOW IF THEY WILL JUST CRACK DOWN ON  THOSE PEOPLE WHO KEEP  INVITING ME TO JOIN  LINKEDIN. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME IN  HERE, OUT THERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, FOLKS,  PLEASE, SIT DOWN. YOU KNOW, NATION, THERE'S  BIG NEWS WE HAVE GOT TO GET  TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS  SHOW THEN YOU KNOW THAT FOR  YEARS NOW JOURNALISTS LIKE ME HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET  ANYTHING TO STICK TO TEFLONA  OBAMA. WELL, NO MORE, FOLKS. BECAUSE EVERY DAY THIS WEEK  BRINGS A NEW SCANDAL FOR HIS  ADMINISTRATION. AND MI SO DISAPPOINTED THAT  THE WEEK HAS ONLY 7 DAYS. (LAUGHTER)  WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THESE  SCANDALS FOR ABOUT THREE  YEARS I'M GUESSING. (LAUGHTER)  IN THE MEANTIME THIS  THURSDAY THE HOUSE WILL HOLD  AN HISTORIC VOTE.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN  BOEHNER ANNOUNCED THE HOUSE  OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL VOTE ONCE AGAIN NEXT WEEK TO  REPEAL OBAMACARE.
THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED  HOUSE PLANS TO VOTE NEXT  WEEK TO REPEAL THE  PRESIDENT'S PLAN FOR THE 37th TIME.
Stephen: YES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: FOR THE 37th  TIME. 37, OF COURSE, IS A PRIME  NUMBER. MEANING IT CAN BE DIVIDED  ONLY BY VICIOUS PARTISANSHIP. PLAV--   (LAUGHTER)  AND HOUSE SPEAKER AND GOOD  SOURCE OF BETA CAROTENE JOHN  BOEHNER IS HOLDING THIS PARTICULAR VOTE FOR THE BEST  POSSIBLE REASONS.
WE'VE GOT 70 NEW MEMBERS  THAT HAVE NOT HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW.
ITS GUYS HAVE BEEN UP  HERE LAST YEAR, UP HERE, WE  CAN GO HOME AND SAY LISTEN, WE VOTED 36 DIFFERENT TIMES  TO REPEAL OR REPLACE  OBAMACARE. TELL ME WHAT THE NEW GUYS  ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY.
Stephen: YEAH! COME ON, MOM! THE OLDER CONGRESS GOT TO  VOTE AGAINST OBAMACARE. IT'S NOT FAIR. (LAUGHTER)  WHY CAN'T WE HAVE HOLLOW  PARTISANSHIP. WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL MY  FRIENDS? I HATE YOU! IT'S NOT JUST OBAMACARE,  FOLKS. THEY SHOULD GET TO DO ALL  THE GOOD VOTES THEY WEREN'T  THERE FOR. REPEALING PROHIBITION,  DECLARING WAR ON JAPAN,  CALLING ON AMERICA TO PUT A  MAN ON THE MOON BY THE END OF 40 YEARS AGO. (LAUGHTER)  BUT OF COURSE LIBERALS ARE  OUT THERE TRYING TO ROB THIS  EMPTY GESTURE OF ITS DEEP  MEANING.
HERE WE GO AGAIN. THIS IS A TOTAL WASTE OF  TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
I THINK IT'S A HUGE WASTE  OF TIME.
THIS REPEAL VOTE IS A  WASTE OF TIME AND TAX  DOLLARS.
Stephen: OH. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND  TAX DOLLARS, DEMOCRATS. WELL, I'VE GOT ANOTHER BILL  FOR YOU TO VOTE ON RIGHT  HERE. (LAUGHTER)  OH, OH, OH, WAIT, I HAVE AN  AMENDMENT. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I AM TELLING YOU, FOLKS, THE  DONKEY CROWD JUST DON'T GET IT EVERY OBAMACARE REPEAL IS  UNIQUE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS  NEVER PLAY THIS ISSUE THE SAME WAY TWICE. AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'VE GOT  EVERY OBAMACARE REPEAL VOTE  ON BOOTLEG. I TRADE TAPES WITH ALL THE  OTHER FANS. WE CALL OURSELVES DEADHEADS  BECAUSE WITHOUT HEALTH  INSURANCE A LOT OF PEOPLE  WILL DIE. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOLKS, THE ONLY THING I  DON'T LIKE IS WHEN THE GOP  GETS ALL SELF-INDULGENT AND TRIES TO PLAY THEIR NEW  STUFF LIKE IMMIGRATION  REFORM. WHICH HAS BEGUN ITS CLIMB  THROUGH CONGRESS IN A  DISTURBING REMINDER THAT  HISPANICS CAN VOTE. (LAUGHTER)  AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS,  THE ONLY REASON THE  REPUBLICANS ARE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE 2012  ELECTION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER  THAT ONE. SADLY I DO. DESPITE DRINKING A SMOOTHIE  OF MY ENTIRE MEDICINE  CABINET. (LAUGHTER)  YOU THINK A COCKTAIL OF  ROLAID, LIST RECENT AND GOLD  BOND POWDER WOULD ERASE  SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER)  LUCKILY, THERE IS A CHANCE  TO STOP THIS THING THANKS TO  SOME HARD NUMBERS FROM CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK AND  GOP RETIREMENT HOME THE  HERITAGE FOUNDATION. (LAUGHTER)  JIM?
A NEW REPORT FROM THE  HERITAGE FOUNDATION SAYING  LEGALIZING IMMIGRATION IS GOING TO COST THE COUNTRY  TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF  DOLLARS.
6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS.
6 TRILLION DOLLARS.
6 TRILLION DOLLARS IF YOU  BELIEVE THAT STUDY. CAN WE AFFORD THAT?
6.3 TRILLION DOLLARS.
NOW YOU CANNOT DISMISS  HERITAGE AS A FRINGE GROUP. THEY'RE VERY MUCH MAINSTREAM  AND YOU CANNOT DISMISS THAT  NUMBER BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE DROPPED RIGHT NOT  MIDDLE OF THE IMMIGRATION  DEBATE.
Stephen: NATIVE BORN  AMERICAN STUART VARNEY IS  CORRECT. HE-- HE-- LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, HE IS SO AWE  THENTICALLY AMERICAN HE HAS  THE SAME ACCENT AS THEY DID IN COL ON-- COLONIAL TIMES. (APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, THE HERITAGE REPORT  6.3 TRILLION PRICE TAG IS A GAME CHANGER. IT'S A DEAL-BREAKER. IT MIGHT EVEN BE A BREAK  DANCER. BECAUSE IT IS SPINNING THE  DEBATE ON ITS HEAD AND THEN  POSING LIKE THIS. (LAUGHTER)  BOTTOM LINE, BOTTOM LINE,  FOLKS, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO  SQUANDER 6.3 TRILLION ON A BUNCH OF FOREIGNERS. WE OWE THAT MONEY TO-- AND  IF WE GIVE THESE MOOCHERS A  PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, IT WILL BE A FIESTA OF  FREELOADING, A CINCO  DEGIMME. THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION  CALCULATES THIS 6.3 TRILLION  BASED ON ILLEGALS USING OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION, HIGHWAYS,  PARKS, POLICE AND  FIREFIGHTERS. AND YES, I KNOW THAT THEY  ARE ALREADY HERE, SO THAT  DOES NOT MEAN THEY'RE USING THINGS LIKE THE FIRE  DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE EVERY ONE KNOWS  UNTIL ARE YOU LEGAL, ARE YOU  NOT FLAMMABLE. AND THE REPORTS--   (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE REPORT RIGHT  HERE, AND I HAVE READ IT, A  GOOD READ. AND THE REPORT DOESN'T EVEN  MENTION THE MONEY WE WOULD  SPEND RETROFITTING EVERY DOORWAY IN AMERICA TO  ACCOMMODATE SOMBREROS. (LAUGHTER)  YEAH! THE LATINO LOVERS OUT THERE  CANNOT REFUTE THIS PLAN ON  THE MERITS. SO THEY HAVE RESORTED TO  PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THE  STUDY'S CO-AUTHOR JASON  RICHARDWINE SEEN HERE AFTER DRINKING A REFRESHING GLASS  OF HAIR. AT ISSUE, AT ISSUE, FOLKS,  AT ISSUE IS RICHWINE'S 2009  HARVARD DISSERTATION, IQ AND IMMIGRATION POLICY, WHICH  STATES THAT THE AVERAGE IQ  OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS SUBSTANTIALLY  LOWER THAN THAT OF THE WHITE  NATIVE POPULATION AND THE  DIFFERENCE IS LIKELY TO PERSIST OVER SEVERAL  GENERATIONS. THAT IS SHOCKING. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER  THAT THE WHITE NATIVE  POPULATION OF THE UNITED  STATES IS ZERO. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  RICHWINE GETS EVEN MORE  SPECIFIC TO SAY NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER HISPANICS WILL EVER  REACH IQ PARITY WITH WHITES  BUT THE PREDICTION THAT NEW HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS WILL  HAVE LOW IQ CHILDREN AND  GRANDCHILDREN IS DIFFICULT  TO ARGUE AGAINST. YES T IS DIFFICULT TO ARGUE  ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN  HISPANIC IQ. NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY  RICHWINE'S IDEAS OFFEND  MEMBERS OF THE HISPANIC RACE,  LIKE JENNIFER LOPEZ, DAVID ORTIZ, DENNEY TREJO AND  FORMER PERUVIAN PRESIDENT  ALBERTO FUJIMORI. I CAN'T TELL THEM APART. BUT EVEN IF RICHWINE WERE A  RACIST, THAT DOESN'T  INVALIDATE THE HERITAGE  REPORT. FIRST OF ALL THIS WEEKEND  RICHWINE RESIGNED FROM THE  HERITAGE FOUNDATION, I  ASSUME TO SPEND MORE TIME MEASURING HIS FAMILY'S SALT. AND THEIR VP, THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION, THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION'S VP OF  COMMUNICATIONS MIKE GONZALEZ PUT UP A BLOG POST SAYING  DR. RICHWINE DID NOT SHAPE  THE METHODOLOGY OR THE  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE HERITAGE PAPER. THE DISSERTATION WAS WRITTEN  WHILE DR. RICHWINE WAS A  STUDENT AT HARVARD  SUPERVISED AND APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE OF RESPECTED  SCHOLARS. ITS FINDING DO NOT REFLECT  THE POSITION OF THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION OR THE  CONCLUSIONS OF OUR STUDY. WELL SAID. THAT MIKE GONZALEZ SOUNDS  PRETTY SMART. HE'S PROBABLY ADOPTED. NOW HERITAGE--   (APPLAUSE)  HERITAGE HERE, HERITAGE IS  SAYING THEY FIND NO CREDENCE IN RICHWINE'S DISSERTATION. WHICH THEY ARE CAREFUL TO  POINT OUT WAS SUPERVISED AND  APPROVED BY RESPECTED  SCHOLARS AT HARVARD. IN OTHER WORDS, RICHWINE'S  PAPER WHICH SAYS THAT  TODAY'S HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS  HAVE LOW IQs AND WILL FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS DOOMING  THEM TO FAILURE IS  REPREHENSIBLE. AND HAD NO INFLUENCE ON THIS  PAPER COWRITTEN BY THE SAME  GUY WHICH SAYS HISPANIC IMMIGRANTS ARE A BURDENSOME  UNDERCLASS AND WILL BE FOR  SEVERAL GENERATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE DOOMED TO FAILURE. BECAUSE THIS ONE IS BASED ON  HARD NUMBERS UNLIKE THIS ONE,  WHICH IS AN OFFENSIVE SCREEN WITH NO CREDIBILITY APPROVED  BY HARVARD SO IT MUST BE  PRETTY GOOD. (LAUGHTER)  THESE TWO PAPERS ARE TOTALLY  DIFFERENT. IT'S LIKE-- IT'S LIKE APPLE  PICKERS AND ORANGE PICKERS. WHICH, BY THE WAY, WE  DESPERATELY NEED. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
