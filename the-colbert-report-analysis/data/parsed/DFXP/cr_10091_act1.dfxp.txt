TONIGHT TROUBLING RUMORS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. I HEARD SHE SLEPT WITH A FORMER PRESIDENT. THEN HOW CAN CHURCHES ATTRACT NEW MEMBERS. GET READY FOR LOG FLUME BAPTISM. AND MY GUEST ACCLAIMED DOCUMENTARIAN KEN BURNS HAS A NEW FILM ABOUT THE  GETTYSBURG ADDRESS, I GAVE IT FOUR SCORE OUT OF FIVE. OSCAR MAYER IS RECALLING 96,000 POUNDS OF HOT DOGS FOR CONTAINING CHEESE. UGH, A HOT DOG MADE WITH AN IDENTIFIABLE FOOD? GROSS. THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN.
THANK YOU, LADIES AND YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, NATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I HOPE THAT-- ANYBODY WATCHING OUT THERE THAT IF YOU KNOW ME AT ALL YOU KNOW THAT I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER OF THE WAR ON TERROR. IT IS A MUCH BETTER BATTLE AGAINST AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT THAN OUR WAR ON APATHY. (LAUGHTER) FRANKLY, I JUST COULDN'T SEE THE POINT OF THAT ONE. WELL, LAST WEEK, FOLKS, WE GOT THE BOMBSHELL NEWS ON THE PEOPLE WE'RE SHELLING WITH BOMBS. JIM?
U.S. INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS ARE EXAMINING A VIDEO THAT APPEARS TO SHOW THE LARGEST AL QAEDA GATHERING IN YEARS. THE RECORDING RECENTLY APPEARED ON JIHADIST WEB SITES, THE MEN ARE MEETING IN A RUGGED MOUNTAINOUS AREA.
THIS VIDEO IS PART AL QAEDA PEP RALLY AND PART PROPAGANDA.
Stephen: AND THIS PEP RALLY PROPAGANDA OR PREPA-GANDA HAS BEEN A HUGE VIRAL SUCCESS, ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE JIHADDISTS WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THE SEQUEL TO THEIR FIRST HIT, MONKEY BARS! BUT THIS WEEKEND THE VIDEO GOT ONE RESOUNDING DOWN VOTE.
THE LARGE ATTACK UNDER WAY AGAINST AN AL QAEDA AFFILIATE IN YEMEN JUST DAYS AFTER CNN FIRST AIRED THIS VIDEO SHOWING THE GROUP AND ITS LEADERSHIP MEETING UP IN THE OPEN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.
YEMENI OFFICIALS ARE CALLING THE OPERATION UNPRECEDENTED KILLING AT LEAST 65 MILITANTS.
Stephen: FOLKS, LET THIS BE A LESSON TO EVERYBODY OUT THERE. TERRORISTS, BUT ALSO TEENS, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA, OKAY? REMEMBER, IT SEEMS INNOCENT ENOUGH BUT IT WILL BE OUT THERE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, WHICH FOR THESE GUYS WAS ABOUT FIVE DAYS. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU REALLY MUST UPLOAD YOUR EMBARRASSING PARTY THAN WILL YOU MAKE SURE GEO TAGGING IS OFF. THEN POST-IT WHERE YOU ARE SURE NO ONE WILL SEE IT. LIKE GOOGLE PLUS. (LAUGHTER) NOW NATION I DON'T MEAN-- SOUND ADVICE. THAT IS STEPHEN'S SOUND ADVICE. NATION, I DON'T MEAN TO ALARM YOU BUT HILLARY CLINTON CONTINUE ITS TO EXIST. (LAUGHTER) SHE IS THE BIGGEST THREAT TO REPUBLICANS IN 2016 OTHER THAN REPUBLICANS IN 2014. (LAUGHTER) AND SHE HAS JUST BECOME MORE THREATENING.
WE HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S FUTURE. AND TODAY WE GOT ONE. SHE'S GOING TO BE A GRANDMOTHER.
Stephen: NOW OBVIOUSLY NEWS OF A GRANDCHILD IS A JOYOUS OCCASION. SOW I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW TO PUT  POLITICS ASIDE AND OFFER THE CLINTON FAMILY A HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONS FOR SUCH A SHREWD POLITICAL MOVE. (LAUGHTER) RIGHT? RIGHT, FOX NEWS?
I THINK A LOT OF THIS MAYBE THIS WAS PLANNED.
Stephen: YES. MAYBE THIS WAS PLANNED. AND WE ALL KNOW ONLY THE MOST DEVIOUS PEOPLE WOULD EVER PLAN A PREGNANCY. (LAUGHTER) CLEAR, CLEARLY, FOLKS, HILLARY CLINTON HAS ENGINEERED THE BIRTH OF HER FIRST GRANDCHILD IN A CRAVEN POLITICAL PLOY TO SEEM ENDEARING. I MEAN NOT EVEN BARACK OBAMA EVER STOOPED TO BECOMING A GRANDMOTHER. (LAUGHTER) IT'S SO OBVIOUS, BILL AND HILLARY CLEARLY SAT  DOWN WITH THEIR DAUGHTER AND SYNCED CHELSEA'S OVULATION CYCLE WITH HILLARY'S POLITICAL CAMPAIGN CALENDAR. THERE IS NO OTHER MOTIVATION FOR A COUPLE IN THEIR 60s TO WANT THEIR DAUGHTER TO GIVE THEM A GRANDCHILD. (LAUGHTER) BUT SOME NA-NA NAYSAYERS SAY NAY NAY.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO TRY TO HAVE A BABY WHENEVER THEY WANT. AND BY THE WAY, IF IT WAS GOING TO BE PLANNED IT WOULD BE PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR WHEN THE CAMPAIGN MIGHT ACTUALLY BE UNDER WAY.
Stephen: GOOD POINT, HOWIE. IF IT WAS PLANNED, THE CHILD WOULD BE BORN AROUND THE IOWA CAUCUSES. I MEAN WHAT A WASTE OF A PERFECTLY GOOD PREGNANCY. SO THAT'S NOT THE ONLY BIG NEWS TO COME OUT OF HILLARY'S STILL MULLING OVER WHETHER THIS IS A CAMPAIGN. LAST WEEK SHE WAS VICIOUSLY ATTACKED.
BETWEEN SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE POSSIBLE RUN FOR PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON FOUND HERSELF UNDER FIRE AS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE LAS VEGAS CONVENTION OF THE SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRY.
IT'S ALREADY RECYCLING.
A WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE THREW A SHOE AS CLINTON WAS SPEAKING YESTERDAY. FORTUNATELY HER AIM WASN'T VERY GOOD.
WHAT WAS THAT, A BAT. WAS THAT A BAT? IS THAT SOMEBODY THROWING SOMETHING AT ME? IS THAT PART OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NO, NO SECRETARY CLINTON IF IT WAS PART OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL THE SHOE WOULD HAVE PERFORMED A TWO-HOUR DREAM OPERA. AND THEN CHARGED YOU $200 A TICKET. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS, I DO NOT TRUST HILLARY CLINTON. AND THERE'S A TON OF PERSON WHO AGREE WITH ME.
WE HAD A CALL YESTERDAY AND BASICALLY THIS WOMAN'S THEORY IS THAT MRS. CLINTON STAGED THE WHOLE INCIDENT WHERE SOMEBODY THREW A SHOE AT HER. THE CLINTON WILL WELL-KNOWN FOR STAGING THINGS. DO THE CLINTON STAGE THINGS? HECK YES, THEY STAGE THINGS. THEREFORE IS IT OUTRAGEOUS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD CALL HERE AND THINK MAYBE HILLARY STAGED THE SHOE THROWING-- NO, IT ISN'T OUTRAGEOUS.
Stephen: OF COURSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN STAGED. I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT, SHE WAS STANDING ON A STAGE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THERE'S A CONSPIRACY (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THERE'S A CONSPIRACY OF FOOT AFOOT. WHICH CAN ONLY BE FULLY ADDRESSED IN MY LONG RUNNING SEGMENT, STEPHEN COLBERT'S [BLEEP] SERIOUS.
HEAR ME OUT.
Stephen: WHERE I EXPLORE CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND POSE THE HARD QUESTIONS LIKE IN NINE YEARS WHY HAVE I ONLY DONE THIS SEGMENT ONCE BEFORE? (LAUGHTER) WHAT DO THEY NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW? AND IF I'M IN CHARGE OF MY SHOW, ARE THEY ME? (LAUGHTER) NOW WE MAY KNOW THE FOOTWEAR BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE FOOT-WHY. RUSH?
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY WOULD BE THROWING A SHOE AT HILLARY UNLESS, AND MAYBE IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE BENGHAZI PEOPLE LOOK LIKE NUTS AND LUNATICS AND WACKOS EVEN IF IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT WHICH I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YES, YES. YES. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES, IT'S ALL PART OF HILLARY'S PLAN TO MAKE THE BENGHAZI PEOPLE LOOK LIKE WACKOS IF IT EVEN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT WHICH RUSH AND I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IF IT DIDN'T THEN WE LOOK LIKE WACKOS FOR BRINGING UP BENGHAZI NOW FOR NO REASON. OH, YOU'RE GOOD! AND FOLKS, THERE ARE OTHER--  (APPLAUSE) THERE ARE OTHER--  (LAUGHTER) SHE CLEARLY PLANNED IT. NO, NO, WE'VE GOT TO GO. FOLKS THERE ARE OTHER BRAVE SHOE TRUTHERS OR SHUTHERS LIKE HERMANN CAINE WHO TWEETED "HMM...FAKERY FROM THE CLINTONS?" AND LINKED TO TO THE WEB SITE WHERE A BLOGGER NOTED SHE DOESN'T PUT HER HANDS UP TO PROTECT HERSELF AND DOESN'T DUCK OUT OF THE WAY UNTIL THE SHOE ALREADY PASSED HER AND IF THERE IS ONE THING CAIN KNOWS IT'S WHAT TO DO WHEN SOMEONE THROWS A SHOE AT YOU.
OH SHUCKY DUCKY.
Stephen: YES, BUT HILLARY, HILLARY, HILLARY DID NOT SHUCKY DUCK FAST ENOUGH. AND ANYONE, ANYONE WHO HAS THROWN A SHOE AT A 66-YEAR-OLD WOMAN KNOWS THEY REACT WITH COBRA SPEED. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HILLARY, HILLARY'S MOTIVATION-- I THINK YOU MIGHT BE SEEING MORE OF THIS PHOTO IN THE FUTURE. YES, I'M A PSYCHIC. HILLARY'S MOTIVATION FOR STAGING THIS SHOE-SPIRACY ARE OBVIOUS AS A POST ON FOX NEWS'S BERNIE GOLDBERG'S BLOG SUGGESTS, REMEMBERING THE BUSH INCIDENT, SHE MAY HAVE CALCULATED THIS WOULD MAKE HER SEEM PRESIDENTIAL. YES! YES, SHE HAS STOLEN PRESIDENT BUSH'S MOST PRESIDENTIAL MOMENT, THE ONLY WAY, ONLY WAY HILLARY CLINTON COULD SEEM MORE LIKE A LEADER IS IF SHE CHOKED ON A PRETZEL WHILE FALLING OFF A SEGWAY. I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THINK ABOUT IT! EITHER THIS INCIDENT WAS ONE TINY MACHINATION IN THE VAST MASTER PLAN METICULOUSLY ORCHESTRATED BY THE CLINTONS OR SOME CRAZY LADY THREW A SHOE AT HER. ASK YOURSELF THIS. WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO POSSIBILITIES LETS ME TALK ABOUT IT FOR SIX MINUTES? (LAUGHTER) NOW CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT IT, HILLARY IS SO DEVIOUS IT IS POSSIBLE EVEN LOSING THE 2008 PRIMARY WAS PART OF HER SCHEME. THAT WAY SHE DOESN'T BECOME PRESIDENT IN 2008, SHE CAN'T GET RE-ELECTED IN 2012, STEERING A PATH FOR A SHOE TO BE THROWN AT HER THE VERY SAME WEEK WE LEARN CHELSEA IS PREGNANT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN IT'S LIKE WE'RE PLAYING CHECKERS AND SHE'S NOT SO WE'RE PLAYING HER SIDE TOO AND SHE'S STILL BEATING US. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S [BLEEP] SERIOUS UNLESS  YOU'RE LISTENING TO THIS FROM THE IMPLANT IN YOUR FILLINGS,  IN WHICH CASE, I'LL BE  WITH YOU ALL NIGHT LONG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
