ENGINEERING GONE OUT OF CONTROL? POTATOES HAVE EEES, CORN HAS  EARS, AND NOW TURNIPS HAVE BIG  TITTIES. THEN BAD NEWS FOR  PHOTOJOURNALISM. A PICTURE IS NOW WORTH ABOUT 37  WORDS. AND MY GUEST, JONATHAN ALTER,  HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT OBAMA  VERSUS THE REPUBLICANS. SO THRILLING, IT'S LIKE NOTHING  GETS DONE ON EVERY PAGE. THE T.S.A. HAS DROPPED ITS PLANS  TO ALLOW GOLF CLUBS ON  AIRPLANES. GREAT. NOW THE PUTTING GREEN IN FIRST  CLASS  S USELESS. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. ALL RIGHT. FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR COMING. FOLKS, THE SUPREME COURT  DELIVERED A LANDMARK RULING  YESTERDAY WITH FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR PRIVACY,  OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,  AND -- I'M SORRY. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING A LITTLE  MORE IMPORTANT I NEED TO TALK  ABOUT. IT'S THAT NEW SUPERMAN MOVIE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NOT SEEN IT. AND   DO NOT LIKE WHAT I HAVE  NOT SEEN. FOLKS, I HAVE BEEN WARNING YOU  ABOUT THE MAN OF STEEL FOR TWO  YEARS NOW. ABOUT THE WAY IT'S LIBERAL  INDOCTRINATION ABOUT HOPE AND  CHANGE AND THE SCANDAL THAT THE GUY PLAYING SUPERMAN IS ENGLISH. EXCUSE ME, ENGLISH. SUPERMAN IS AN AMERICAN FROM  KRYPTON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] READ YOUR CONSTITUTION. EVEN WORSE, FOLKS, THIS HENRY  CAVILL GUY LOOKS ALMOST EXACTLY  LIKE THE GUY THEY CAST TO PLAY CLARK KENT. II'S GOING TO CONFUSE THE  AUDIENCE. THINK. AND TODAY, TODAY I SAW SOMETHING  THAT REALLY CROSSED THE LINE. BY THAT, I MEAN THE VISIBLE  PANTY LINE. SUPERMAN IS NOT WEARING HIS  TRADITIONAL RED UNDERWEAR. THIS IS DISGUSTING. YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE OUTLINE  OF HIS, SHALL WE SAY, FORTRESS  OF SOLITUDE. COME ON!   ( APPLAUSE ) -pI'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY IT DOESN'T EVEN  LOOK LIKE HE'S WEARING UNDERWEAR  INSIDE HIS TIGHTS WHICH COULD BEE3 TROUBLE BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,  OUR EARTH TALC HAS NO EFFECT ON  HIM. I MEAN LOOK AT THIS GUY. HE'S JUST BLUE, BLUE, BLUE, HEAD  TO TOE. IT'S LIKE WEARING A DENIM JACKET  WITH DENIM JEANS WHICH EVERYONE  KNOWS GOT AQUAMAN KICKED OUT OF THE JUSTICE LEAGUE. THE RED UNDERWEAR, FOLKS, THE  RED UNDERWEAR IS A CRUCIAL PART  OF SUPERMAN'S COSTUME. EVERY SUPERMAN HAS WORN THEM  STARTING WITH GEORGE REEVES AND  HIS BELTED GRANNY PANTIES. THAT'S HOW WE WORE UNDERWEAR IN  THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS BEFORE ELASTIC WAS  INVENTED. AND LISTEN TO THE LAME EXCUSE  SCREEN WRITER DAN GOYER GIVES  FOR CREATING THE COMMANDO OF  STEEL.
OUR APPROACH WAS NOT A COMIC  BOOKKSUPERMAN. IT WAS JUST TO DO A MORE  REALISTIC SUPEEMAN.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. A MORE REALISTIC SUPERMAN  pECAUSE WHEN YOUR HERO IS A  FLYING MAN FROM ANOTHER PLANET WHO CAN CRUSH COAL INTO DIAMONDS  AND MELT TITANIUM WITH HIS HEAT  VISION, YOU DON'T WANT HIM DOING SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE LIKE  UNDERWEAR. I MEAN, GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST. AND, FOLKS, I'M SORRY ABOUT  THAT. I GUESS THE REASON I TAKE THIS  SO PERSONALLY IS THAT I AM SO  MUCH LIKE SUPERMAN. IN THEIR DARKEST HOUR... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SOMEONE HAD TO SAY IT. AND ONCE AGAIN IT HAD TO BE ME. LIKE SUPERMAN, IN THEIR DARKEST  HOUR, I ALWAYS AM THERE TO  DEFEND THE UNDERDOG. LIKE EXXON. OR GOLDMAN SACHS AND UNDERDOG  INDUSTRIES. HOW COULD UNDERDOG HAVE KNOWN  THAT GIVING DOGS A CHEMICAL  UNDERCOAT WOULD SEAL THEIR POURS AND CAUSE CANINE DEMENTIA? BOTTOM LINE: DID THOSE DOGS RUST  OR NOT? THEY DIDN'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH. WELL NOW, ANOTHER DEFENSELESS  MULTINATIONAL IS BEING UNFAIRLY  ATTACKED BECAUSE OF A LITTLE  SLIP-UP.
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE  SCRAMBLING TO FIND OUT PPECISELY  HOW GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT CREATED BY BIOTECH GIANT MAN  SANDT OWE ENDED UP IN AN OREGON  WHEAT FARM.
THE WHEAT WAS TESTED AFFER IT  WAS SPRAYED REPEATEDLY BUT IT  WOULD NOT DIE. GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT WAS  CREATED BY MONSANTO A DECADE AGO  BUT NEVER APPROVED FOR COMMERCIAL USE.
THE WHEAT WAS GENETICALLY  MODIFIED, THE SAME STRAIN TESTED  BUT THEN ABANDONED BY MONSANTO FROM 1998 TO 2005
Stephen: A FARMER FOUND  GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT IN  HIS FIELD THAT MONSANTO STOPPED GROWING BACK IN 2005 WHICH MEANS  THIS WHEAT IS NOT ONLY  REPRODUCING ON ITS OWN BUT SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TELL  IT THAT MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE  WAS CANCELED. THE WHEAT WAS CREATED TO BE ONE  OF MONSANTO'S ROUND-UP READY  CROPS WHICH AREEGENETICALLY ENGINEERED TO WITHSTAND  BOMBARDMENT BY MONSANTO'S  ROUND-UP, A POWERFUL HERBICIDE THAT KILLS EVERY LIVING PLANT  EXCEPT THE CROP. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE WHEAT  CAME FROM SINCE MONSANTO SWEARS  IT DESTROYED ALL TESTED MATERIAL AFTER ABANDONING THE PROGRAM. AND THEN JUST TO MAKE SURE NO  ONE EVER  OUND THE REMAINS, THEY  BURIED THAT WHEAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD. BUT NOW, FOLKS, NOW THE WHEAT IS  BACK AND THE COMPANY HAS A  PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION. MONSANTO SAYS IT IS MYSSIFIED BY  THE APPEARANCE OF THE WHEAT. OKAY. THEY DON'T KNOW SO MAYBE WE  SHOULD ASK THE GENETICALLY  MODIFIED WHEAT. AT THIS POINT, IT CAN PROBABLY  TALK. LONG STORY SHORT. THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL  BUT TRY TEELING THAT TO THE  SKITTISH FOREIGNERS.
JAPAN IMMEDIATELY POSTPONED A  25,000-TON ORDER FROM A PORTLAND  GRAIN SHIPPER. IT'S PUT IN JEOPARDY THIS YEAR'S  ORE GONE CROP WHICH IS VALUED  BETWEEN $500 AND $500 MILLION.
Stephen: REALLY, JAPAN? YOU'RE AFRAID OF A LITTLE  GENETICALLY MODIFIED WHEAT? MAY I REMIND YOU, YOU EAT RAW  OCTOPUS  AINT. NOW, SURE, OREGON WHEAT FARMERS  ARE HURTING BUT WE ALL KNOW  MONSANTO IS THE REAL VICTIM  HERE. THEY COULD FACE CRIMINAL  PROSECUTION AND BE FINED UP TO A  MILLION DOLLARS. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES  MONSANTO TO EARN A MILLION... OH, THEY JUST DID. THAT WAS FAST. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND AGAIN. I SAY EVERYONE JUST NEEDD TO  RELAX. THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM  MONSANTO'S GENETICALLY MODIFIED  UNKILLABLE MYSTERY WHEAT OR, AS I CALL IT, MY AMBER WAVES  FRANKEN-GRAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SEE? IT'S PERFECTLY FRIENDLY. JUST DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN  MOVES. HERE TO TELL US WHY MY WHEAT IS  NOT TO BE TRUSTED IS PULITZER  PRIZE WINNING SCIENCE JOURNALIST FROM THE COUNCIL ON  OREIGN  RELATIONS, LAURIE GARRETT. LAURIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO.
(LAUUHING)  Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. NOW, LAURIE, HOW DID THIS WHEAT  GET OUT? DID IT TUNNEL OUT OF MMNSANTO  FROM BEHIND A RITA HAYWORTH  POSTER? HOW DID IT GET INTO THE FIELD.
IN THE LATEST STATEMENT FROM  MONSANTO HINTED THAT IT MAY HAVE -pBEEN SABOTAGED.
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE  WHO TOOK THEIR WHEAT.
SUPPOSEDLY. THAT'S WHAT MMNSANTO IS LEAKING,  THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE  CAUSE. WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S VERY STRANGE BECAUSE  THERE'S NO WAY SEEDS SHOULD  SURVIVE IN THE SOIL FOR  ORE THAN A COUPLE OF YEARS
Stephen: HOW CAN SOMETHING  THAT THEY DIDN'T DEVELOP IN THE  LAST ALMOST NINE YEARS AT THIS POINT, HOW COULD IT HAVE  SURVIVED? IS IT DOING A RAMBO OUT THERE? IS THE WHEAT LIVING OFF MUD  PUDDLES AND GRUBS SOME.
THE ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT  THERE ARE 24 STRAINS OF  SO-CALLED SUPER WHEATS. THESE ARE GIANT WHEATS THAT ARE  VERY HARD TO KILL BECAUSE  GENESVE ABSORBED THESE STRANGE
Stephen: THERE'S A GENE IN  THERE THAT KEEPS ROUND-UP FROM  KILLING IT. THAT CAN JUMP TO THE WEED IT'S  TRYING TO KILL?
EXACTLY  Stephen: HOW DO YOU KILL  THOSE WEEDS?
JUST THE WAY YOU KILLED  THESE.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK THESE  ARE DEAD YET. NOW, ARE THE JAPANNESE RIGHT? IS THERE A REASON TO NOT GET  THIS GRAIN? IS THERE A DANGER?
IIDON'T THINK THERE'S ANY  DANGER TO HUMAN HEALTH.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE CALLING  IT ZOMBIE WHEAT. YOU KNOW. IT'S THE RETURN OF THE WALKING  BREAD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S JUST SCARE TACTICS?
LOOK, THE INTERESTING THING  IS THAT MONSANTO ACTUALLY COULD  BE COMPLETELY OPEN ABOUT THIS ONE BECAUSE FARMER BARNES IN  KANSAS WHO FILED THE LAWSUIT...
Stephen: THERE'S A GUY IN  KANSAS WHO SAYS TTIS IS GOING TO  HURT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST JAPAN BUT SOUTH KOREA. EUROPE IS LOOKING TO CANCEL THE  SHIPMENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES  AND HE WAATS TO SUE MONSANTO FOR THIS BREACH OF TRUST.
EXACTLY. SENATOR ROY BLUNT WHO HAPPENS TO  BE FROM THE STATE THAT IS THE  HEADQUARTERS OF MONSANTO STUCK A PARAGRAPH INTO THE BUDGET  RESOLUTION THAT IS CALLED THE  FARMERS ASSURANCE PROVIIION. IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SUE  ISSUES.
Stephen: SO HOW LONG DOES  THAT LAST?
SIX MONTHS. tephen: ARE WE IN THE MIDDLE  OF THAT RIGHT NOW?
IT WENT INTO EFFECT IN THE  MIDDLE OF MARCH
Stephen: THIS CROP THAT CAME  OUT OF NOWHERE AND THAT MONSANTO  SAYS THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT CAME FROM JUST HAPPENED TO  APPEAR DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME  WHERE MONSANTT GOT A GET OUT OF JAAL FREE CARD.
GO FIGURE. Stephen: CAN I GET ONE OF  THOSE? ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF GENETICALLY  MODIFIED FOODS OR ARE YOU  SOMEBODY WHO IS OPPOSED TO GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND  BEFORE YOU ANSWER, PLEASE DON'T  SAY ANYTHING INSULTINGG I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MY WHEAT  ANGRY. GUYS, GUYS, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. HERE IS SOME MEAT. (GROWLING) YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR SAFETY'S SAKE WE SHOULD JUST  GET GOING. LAURIE GARRETT, EVERYBODY. THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN  RELATIONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
