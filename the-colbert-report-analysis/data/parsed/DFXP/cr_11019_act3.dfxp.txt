MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, I PLAN TO RECORD HER LANGUAGE BEFORE HER TRIBE DISAPPEARS FOREVER. PLEASE WELCOME KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR BEING HERE. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MADAM, ARE YOU A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK, AND YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK, AND IT IS CALLED "OFF THE SIDELINES-- RAISE YOUR VOICE, CHANGE THE WORLD." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW YOU GOT A BOOK TO PUSH. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD TO GET OUT OF BED THIS MORNING. KNOWING THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO THE DUST BIN OF HISTORY. AFTER LAST NIGHT'S ELECTIONS, THE LAST ELECTION, I UNDERSTAND, THERE EVER WILL BE. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW DOES IT FEEL? WAS IT HARD TO GET UP THIS MORNING?
YOU KNOW, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, OF COURSE. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN TO SEE IF MITCH MdCONNELL SAYS-- IS GOING TO DO WHAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO WHICH IS ACTUALLY TRY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND GET THINGS DONE.
Stephen: ARE YOU DEMOCRATS ARE FINALLY GOING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY, STOP BEING SUCH OBSTRUCTIONIST OF THE REPUBLICANS' AGENDA? I MEAN, ALL THE THINGS THEY RAN ON, ARE YOU GOING TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THOSE PLANS FOR  AMERICA'S BETTER FUTURE?
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND, AND THAT'S SOMETHING I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, AND DOING SOMETHING LIKE MAKING SURE STUDENTS CAN REFINANCE THEIR FEDERAL LOANS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, WORKING ON ENDING SEXUAL ASSAULT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S THE KIND OF COMMON GROUND I HOPE WE CAN GET DONE, AND I THINK WHAT THE ELECTION WAS REALLY ABOUT IS PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. THEY'RE FRUSTRATED. THEY LOOK AT WASHINGTON AND THEY KNOW IT'S BROKEN, AND THEY WANT US TO LISTEN TO THEM AND DO THEIR JOB. AND I'M AS FRUSTRATED AS THEY ARE.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO HELP THE REPUBLICANS ACHIEVE THEIR NUMBER ONE GOAL-- BUILD A TIME MACHINE AND MAKE BARACK OBAMA NEVER HAVING EXISTED? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
WELL, I HOPE THAT THEY ARE SINCERE AND ACTUALLY WANT TO DO THE BUSINESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY, FOCUSING ON GETTING THINGS DONE.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY ARE ON AN INTERESTING COMMITTEE. YOU'RE ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE. AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN, JAMES INHOFE. YOU AND HE DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON GLOBAL WARMING.
YES.
Stephen: HE'S GOT SOME INTERESTING IDEAS. HE BELIEVES IT IS NOT HAPPENING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT IT IS A HOAX. OKAY? WHERE IS THE MIDDLE GROUND FOR THE TWO OF YOU? ARE YOU GOING TO COME OVER TO HIS SIDE? ARE YOU GOING TO COMPROMISE ON THAT ONE AND JUST SAY IT'S NOT HAPPENING AND I'M SURE HE'LL AGREE WITH YOU.
I THINK THERE ARE SOME COMMON SENSE THINGS WE CAN WORK ON ANY NEW YORKER KNOWS HOW CRUSHING SUPERSTORM SANDY WAS, SO YOU HAVE THESE VIOLENT SUPERSTORMS COMING NOT ONCE EVERY 100 YEARS BUT ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER TO WORK ON THINGS AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT.
Stephen: BUT HE'S FROM OKLAHOMA AND THEY DON'T HAVE HURRICANES.
BUT THEY HAVE TORNADOES AND THERE ARE WILDFIRES IN THE WEST.
Stephen: AND THEY'RE PREPARED TO ALLOW OKLAHOMA TO BECOME ETHIOPIA, AND THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF OUR PROBLEM, WHICH WILL BE TOO MUCH WATER. OKAY. MAYBE YOU COULD MEET TOGETHER SOMEWHERE IN APPALACHA WHERE THE WATERS WON'T RISE?
I WILL TRY TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND COMMON GROUND TO ADDRESS THESE REAL CHALLENGES OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FACING.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT WASHINGTON WILL GET ANY MORE... FRIENDLY NOW THAT Y'ALL CAN SMOKE POT WITH EACH OTHER? ( LAUGHTER ) LEGALLY. DO YOU SMOKE POT?
NO. BUT I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT A LOT OF STATES ARE TAKING IT UP AS A REFERENDUM. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS VERY RIPE FOR REVIEW. AND I THINK FOR OUR STATE, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ANY PERSON WHO IS PRESCRIBED MEDICAL MARIJUANA GETS ACCESS TO IT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: BUT LEGALLY, LEGALLY, WHEN YOU'RE DOWN DOING YOUR JOB, YOU KNOW, AND AFTER HOURS, LEGALLY, YOU GUYS COULD ALL GET TOGETHER AND SMOKE POT.
WE COULD.
Stephen: YOU COULD.
WE COULD.
Stephen: MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP, MAYBE AND YOU MITCH MdCONNELL GET TOGETHER-- I'M NOT SAYING, I DON'T SMOKE POT, BUT MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD SMOKE POT AND BE LIKE, "WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? YOU'RE COOL, I LOVE YOU." YOU KNOW. HE CAN CATCH HIS REFLECTION IN SOMETHING AND GO,  "I DO LOOK LIKE A TURTLE. THAT'S HILARIOUS." YOU KNOW? THINK ABOUT IT. IT COULD TURN THE CAPITOL INTO ONE BIG BONG, IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. WHAT DO YOU HOPE-- IF YOU COULD BRING LEGISLATION TO THE REPUBLICANS, WHAT WOULD YOU-- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, "GUYS, LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER?" WHAT WOULD YOU BRING TO THE FLOOR FIRST?
I WOULD FOCUS ON ECONOMIC AGENDA AND SPECIFICALLY PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WE ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRIAL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DOESN'T CREATE PAID LEAVE FOR FAMILY EMERGENCIES WHETHER IT'S A NEW BABY, A SICK FAMILY MEMBER,  AGING AND DYING PARENT.
Stephen: BUT WE DO ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE  PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS. THAT'S A STEP YOU CAN LEAVE. YOU JUST CAN'T COME BACK.
MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE. THE WOMAN WHO IS IT GOING TO CLEAN THE STUDIO TONIGHT CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE DAYS UNPAID. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALL WORKERS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN, WHO ARE OFTEN DEALING WITH A LOT OF FAMILY EMERGENCIES CAN GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE IN THE WORKPLACE AND ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AND I WOULD FOCUS ON SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I RECENTLY, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS, I RECENTLY FOUND OUT I WAS A FEMINIST SO I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU. WHEN YOU SAY "OFF THE SIDELINES" ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS OR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WOMEN OR ANYBODY? WHO IS ON THE SIDELINES THAT YOU HAVE TO GET OFF THEM?
IT'S ABOUT WOMEN.
Stephen: I CAN INTERESTED?
YOU CAN READ IT. IF YOU DO YOU WILL LEARN A LOT ABOUT-- YOU WILL LEARN A LOT ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
Stephen: ONE THING I UNDERSTAND ABOUT MY WIFE, SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN I HOLD HANDS WITH WOMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THE BOOK IS "OFF THE SIDELINES." READ IT, MALE, FEMALE, GO GET IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
