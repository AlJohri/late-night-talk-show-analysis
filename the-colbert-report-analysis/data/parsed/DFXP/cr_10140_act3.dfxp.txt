( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR OF ""TITANIC" WHOSE NEW FILM IS ABOUT DIVING THE MARIANA TRENCH IN A SUBMARINE FINALLY, SOMEONE WENT LOOKING FOR THAT NECKLACE. PLEASE WELCOME JAMES CAMERON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, JAMES. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT YOUR NEW MOVIE, AND THE ADVENTURE THAT YOU WENT ON. AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE AGAIN, RIGHT? YOU PUT AMERICA BACK IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF EXPLORATION.
DAMN RIGHT THE SUB WAS BUILT IN AUSTRALIA.
Stephen:  OKAY. THANK YOU FOR COMING. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE BUILT PART OF IT HERE.
Stephen:  YOUR NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D." TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE WHAT YOU DID, WHEN YOUR DREAM WAS AND HOW YOU ACHIEVED IT.
I IMAGINED GOING TO THE DEEPEST SPOT ON THE PLANET. I GOT A GREAT TEAM AROUND ME, WE BUILT A  SUB --
Stephen:  THIS IS-- THIS IS WHAT YOU WENT IN.
THIS IS THE SUB. AND I WOULD GO IN THE HATCH --
Stephen:  LET'S TURN THAT BAD BOY AROUND. YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN. ALL RIGHT HOW BIG IS THIS THING IN REALITY? HOW BIG IN REALITY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
24 FEET.
Stephen:  AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE THAT VERY BIG DOWN THERE.
NO, PROBABLY SMALLER THAN THE SIZE OF THIS TABLE IS THE SPHERE I WAS IN.
Stephen:  HOW TALL ARE YOU?
6'2".
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, YOU BUILT IT. WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE YOURSELF A MORE LUXURIOUS CABIN. DID YOU GET IN AND SAY OH, ( BLEEP ). WE BUILT IT IN CENTIMETERS. I MEANT INCHES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, BUDGET.
Stephen:  OKAY.
BUDGET. SO WE TRIED TO MAKE IT SMALL ENOUGH THAT WE COULD GET IT ON TO A SHIP AND OFF A SHIP.
Stephen:  REALLY, BUDGET? IF ONLY YOU HAD A MORE SUCCESSFUL CAREER.
YES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  I'M SO SORRY. WHY IS THIS YOUR DREAM? YOU'VE DONE-- YOU'VE DONE ALL THESE FANTASTIC MOVIES. THE "TITANIC," BUT WHY-- WHY PUT YOURSELF IN THIS KIND OF DANGER TO GO TO THE DEEPEST POINT IN THE OCEAN? WHY NOT JUST TAPE A GO-PRO TO A BAG OF ROCKS AND DROP IT OFF? SAME DIFF! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO?
I TOLD-- I TOLD THE CREW-- I THREW A CRESCENT WRENCH OVERBOARD AND SAID THAT JUST WENT TO THE DEEPEST SPOT IN THE OCEAN. GETTING DOWN THERE IS EASY. AND GETTING BACK IS HARD. THAT'S WHY WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THE TECH DEVELOPMENT. WHY DID I WANT TO GO? CURIOSITY. I WANTED TO SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES. I WANTED TO SEE A PLACE NO ONE HAD SEEN BEFORE.
Stephen:  IT LOOKS LIKE A COCK EYED SUBMARINE. IT LOOKS LIKE A SUBMARINE POINTED DOWN.
WE CALLED IT THE VERTICAL TORPEDO. I SAID GUYS WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A VERTICAL TORPEDO AND DRIVE IT STRAIGHT DOWN AS A MATTER OF FACT WE CAN.
Stephen:  THAT WAS MY STRIPPER NAME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, LET'S LOOK-- LET'S LOOK AT A LITTLE CLIP OF YOU IN THE VERTICAL TORPEDO.
RELEASE. RELEASE. RELEASE.
I THINK MY HEART RATE'S UP A LITTLE BIT AT THE MOMENT THAT I TELL THEM TO RELEASE THE SUB. I START TO DROP. BUT RIGHT AWAY, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO DO-- ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONS AND ALL THAT.
SURFACE. DEEP SEA CHALLENGER, DO YOU COPY? OVER.
DEEP SEA CHALLENGER, HOW DO YOU COPY, OVER?
COPY YOU JOHN, LOUD AND CLEAR.
IT'S LIKE I'M TALKING TO MY GRANDMA.
DO YOU WANT A BISCUIT? ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  HOW LONG-- HOW LONG DID THE TRIP TAKE? ( APPLAUSE ) HOW LONG-- HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN?
TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO GET DOWN, AN HOUR AND A HALF TO GET BACK UP, AND THERE WERE THREE HOURS ON THE BOTTOM. I HAD HOPED FOR MORE, LIKE 5.
Stephen:  I DON'T DO MATH. HOW MUCH IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT?
SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS.
Stephen:  SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS. WHAT WERE THE FACILITIES LIKE? YOU DIDN'T HAVE ROOM FOR A  BATHROOM, DID YOU?
NOT AT ALL, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON A CAR TRIP AND YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND THEY TURN AND HAND YOU A BOTTLE.
Stephen:  REALLY? HOW MUCH DID THIS COST TO MAKE?
A LOT.
Stephen:  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
MILLIONS.
Stephen:  WHEN IT CAME TO GO TO THE BATHROOM-- YOU WERE BASICALLY, YOU WERE BASICALLY AN UNDERSEA TRUCKER.
YES, THE TRUCKER'S FRIEND
Stephen:  AS YOU SAID, EASY TO GET DOWN, HARD TO GET UP. ONCE YOU'RE DOWN THERE AT 36,000 FEET, WHICH IS-- I THINK YOU SAY IN HERE IT'S DEEPER THAN EVEREST IS HIGH.
PLUS FOUR EMPIRE STATE BUILDINGS ON TOP OF THAT.
Stephen:  OKAY, HOW DO YOU GET BACK UP?
YOU JUST DROP THESE WEIGHTS THAT ARE ON THE SIDE. I THROW ONE SWITCH. THE WEIGHTS COME OFF AND I COME UP LIKE A ROCKET, SEVEN KNOTS.
Stephen:  HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE FIRST MAN TO EVER LITTER THE MARIANA TRENCH? DID YOU FEEL LIKE ARMSTRONG THROWING A COKE BOTTLE ON THE MOON?
EXACTLY. YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON THAT'S ASKED THAT QUESTION.
Stephen:  I THINK I WON! OKAY, OKAY. LET ME ASK ONE OTHER QUESTION-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'VE DONE ALL THIS EXPLORATION. YOU'VE DONE ALL THIS EXPLORATION. OBVIOUSLY, YOU NEED THIS EXPLORATION. YOU SPENT THIS TIME, YOU SPENT THIS MONEY. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THE TIME TO DO THE EXPLORATION  IN HERE?
I'LL WORK ON THAT.
Stephen:  JAMES CAMERON, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. JAMES CAMERON "DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
