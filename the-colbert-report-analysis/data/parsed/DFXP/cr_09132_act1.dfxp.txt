Stephen: TONIGHT, WILL  HILLARY CLINTON RUN IN 2016? AND WILL JOE BIDEN RUN INTO A  GLASS DOOR? THEN, A FAMILY ACTIVITY GETS A  MODERN UPDATE. KIDS, IF YOU DON'T STOP  FIGHTING, THIS GOOGLE CAR WILL  TURN ITSELF AROUND. AND MY GUEST, EMILY MATCHAR SAYS  WOMEN ARE EMBRACING TRADITIONAL  HOME MAKING ACTIVITIES LIKE CANNING AND KNITTING. I'LL JOIN IN THE FUN BY WORKING  A 12-HOUR DAY AND THEN HAVING A  MASSIVE CORONARY. SIMON COWELL HAS REPORTEDLY  IMPREGNATED HIS FRIEND'S WIFE. THAT IS SHOCKING. SIMON COWELL HAS A FRIEND. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, THANK  YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. FOLKS, I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP A  LEVEL HEAD. YOU KNOW I FOR ONE ALWAYS TRY TO  KEEP A LEVEL HEAD BUT EVEN I AM  ENRAGED BY THIS BRADLEY MANNING  TRIAL. FIRST OF ALL, THAT HE HAD A  TRIAL. THOSE PRISONERS IN GITMO MUST BE  DYING TO KNOW HOW HE WRANGLED  THAT SWEET DEAL. YOU MAY REMEMBER BRADLEY MANNING  AS THE WIKILEAKER WHO RELEASED  THE INFAMOUS COLLATERAL MURDER VIDEO OR PERHAPS FOR BEING THE  LEAST ATHLETIC MANNING BROTHER. HIT THE WHEATIES. NOW, SINCE HIS ARREST THREE  YEARS AGO MANNING HAS BEEN HELD  IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR 23 HOURS A DAY, FORCED TO SLEEP  NAKED WITHOUT PILLOWS AND SHEETS  ON HIS BED. BUT I SAY HE DESERVES IT. FOR PETE'S SAKE THE GUY REVEALED  THAT THE UNITED STATES TORTURES. PARTLY THROUGH HIS DOCUMENT LEAK  BUT MOSTLY BY HOW WE TORTURED  HIM. WELL, BRACE YOURSELVES, FOLKS  BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE JUDGE IN  THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL HANDED DOWN A SHOCKING DECISION.
BRADLEY MANNING IS NOT  GUILTY. NOT GUILTY OF AIDING THE ENEMY. THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE AGAINST  HIM. AND ONE THAT CARRIES WITH IT A  POSSIBLE LIFE SENTENCE. THAT WON'T HAPPEN.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. MANNING WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF  THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGE: AIDING  THE ENEMY. AND EVEN MORE SHOCKING, HE WAS  ALSO FOUND NOT GUILTY OF  SHOOTING TRAYVON MARTIN. EVIDENTLY, NO ONE IS GUILTY OF  THAT ONE. NOW, FOLKS, THEY DID CONVICT HIM  ON 20 OTHER COUNTS, INCLUDING  VIOLATING THE ESPIONAGE ACT OF  1917. AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE  GRATEFUL FOR PRESIDENT WILSON'S  FORWARD-THINKING STANCE ON CYBER  CRIME. OKAY. FIGHTING AL KAISER. BUT JUST LISTEN TO THE SLAP ON  THE WRIST THE JUDGE COULD BE  GIVING MANNING.
IF YOU TAKE THE SECOND AND  THIRD CHARGES WHICH HAVE A  NUMBER OF SPECIFICATIONS INCLUDED IN ALL OF THEM, IT  COULD AMOUNT TO A TOTAL SENTENCE  OF 154 YEARS.
Stephen: 154 YEARS? THAT IS NOTHING. I MEAN, THE GUY'S ONLY 25. HE COULD BE OUT IN TIME TO SEE  HIS GREAT, GREAT, GREAT, GRAND  KIDS PLAY WITH HIS BONES. BUT HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET,  FOLKS. HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET. MANNING IS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF  AIDING THE ENEMY. BUT HE IS FOUND GUILTY OF  ESPIONAGE. SO THEN WHO WAS HE SPYING FOR  WHEN HE TOLD US WHAT THE  GOVERNMENT WAS DOING? OH, MY GOD! HE WAS WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. OH, MY GOD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MAKE SENSE. WE WERE PAYING HIS SALARY. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, I'M NOT  SURPRISED. I NEVER TRUSTED THAT BUNCH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO THE  INDIANS, RIGHT? I MEAN, JOHNNY DEPP ALONE. AND NOW THAT WE KNOW WHO MANNING  WAS FEEDING ALL THE GOVERNMENT  SECRETS TO, I MEAN, SOMEBODY SHOULD BE KEEPING AN EYE ON  THESE PEOPLE. OH, THEY ARE? OH, GOOD. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WITHOUT A DOUBT. FOLKS, YESTERDAY PRESIDENT OBAMA  GAVE A MAJOR ABOUT THE ECONOMY  AT AN AMAZON DISTRIBUTION  CENTER. I THINK HE CHOSE AMAZON BECAUSE  THEY'RE GOING TO START EQUIPPING  CONGRESSMEN WITH A "BUY NOW"  BUTTON. I WASN'T REALLY PAYING THAT MUCH  ATTENTION TO THE SPEECH BECAUSE  TODAY'S PRESIDENT IS YESTERDAY'S  NEWS. PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE WATCHING  A RERUN OF THIS SHOW. NOW, LIKE EVERY OTHER  JOURNALIST, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT  WILL HAPPEN IN 2016. WELL, YESTERDAY WE GOT OUR FIRST  CLUE WHEN HILLARY CLINTON  STOPPED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.
SHE SPENT ABOUT TWO HOURS IN  THE WHITE HOUSE. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DID THEY  TALK ABOUT?
COULD IT HAVE SOME INKLING OF  WHAT COULD TAKE PLACE IN 2016?
JUST LUNCH OR IS IT CAMPAIGN  2016 JUST GETTING STARTED? WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY  RODHAM CLINTON HAVING A PRIVATE  LUNCH TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: THE WHITE HOUSE! AT THE (SING SONG N) WHITE  HOUSE. WHAT COULD IT MEAN? PING, PING. WE DON'T KNOW. BUT A TOTAL ABSENCE OF FACTS HAS  NEVER STOPPED CABLE NEWS BEFORE. REMEMBER, WE'RE THE ONES WHO  BROKE THE STORY THAT THE ROYAL  BABY WAS EITHER A BOY OR A GIRL. AND WE WERE RIGHT. SO WE WERE ALL READY WITH OUR  CRACK ANALYSIS IN THAT FOR THE  MOST PART WE PULLED IT OUT OF OUR CRACKS.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE TO  PUT ANYTHING ON HIS SCHEDULE. PUTTING THAT WE'RE HAVING LUNCH  WITH HILLARY CLINTON ON THE  SCHEDULE CLEARLY SAYS SOMETHING.
Stephen: YEAH, SOMETHING. DON'T KNOW WHAT THOUGH. AND NEITHER DOES TOURE. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIS  LAST NAME IS. STILL, A GREAT STORY. BUT IS THERE ANY INFORMATION  ABOUT THIS LUNCH?
DID IT AL FRESCO, THAT MEANS  OUTDOORS.
Stephen: OKAY. OUTDOORS. OUTDOORS. GOT THAT. AND, OKAY AND I'M BEING TOLD  DOORS MEANS BIG HOUSE WITH NO  WALLS AND SKY CEILING. WE'RE GETTING SOME PLACE. WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW?
THE PRESIDENT IN SHIRT  SLEEVES.
THEY ALSO LET US KNOW THAT  THEY HAD GRILLED CHICKEN AND  PASTA.
YOU COULD SEE IN THE PICTURE  SOME SALAD. THERE WERE NO DRINKS IN THE  PICTURE SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT  WAS SERVED AS A BEVERAGE WITH THEIR LUNCH.
IS IT A LUNCH JUST A LUNCH? WHAT'S GOING ON.
Stephen: YEAH, WHAT'S GOING  ON? I MEAN, IS A LUNCH JUST A LUNCH? IF YOU EAT BREAKFAST AT 11:30,  DOES THAT MAKE IT BRUNCH? WILL THE GRA TEUT BE ADDED  AUTOMATICALLY ON A PARTY OF  EIGHT OR MORE? WHILE WE'RE ADD IT, COULD IT GET  THE COBB SALAD WITHOUT BOILED  EGG, BLUE CHEESE OR BACON? OH, AND INSTEAD OF KREUT ONS,  COULD I GET SOME [BLEEP] NEWS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OR IS THAT JUST OFF THE MENU? IS THAT NOT AVAILABLE? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T NEED NEWS FROM THE CABLE  CROWD BECAUSE I CAN ANALYZE THE  ENTIRE 2016 CAMPAIGN STRATEGY THROUGH THIS LUNCH. FIRST OF ALL, HILLARY'S  CAMPAIGN, IT IS ON TO THE ON. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY ATE OUTDOORS  TO WOO THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. HAD THE JAMBALAYA TO COURT GULF  COAST DEMOCRATS. PRESIDENT'S ROLED-UP SLEEVES  SAY, "I SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO  BARE ARMS."  BUT THE LACK OF BEVERAGES SAYS THAT UNDER HILLARY, THERE WILL  BE NO WATER BOARDING, TAP OR  SPARKLING. AND THE GRILLED CHICKEN? IT WAS ON SALE AT SAFE WAY. NOW, NEXT UP ON T.C.R., CHECK  OUT THE LATEST DUST-UP IN THE  REPUBLICAN RUMBLE BETWEEN CHRIS CHRISTIE AND RAND PAULY. WHEN LAST WE LOOKED THE ORIGINAL  JERSEY BOY RIPPED LIBERTARIANISM  WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS IS R-PAUL'S B.F.F., BEST PHILOSOPHY FOREVER. AND THE GOOD KENTUCKY SENATOR'S  RESPONSE? "KISS MY REBUTTAL."
THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO  CRITICIZE ME AND CALL NAMES,  THEY'RE PRECISELY SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE UNWILLING TO CUT THE  SPENDING AND THEIR GIMME ME ALL  MY SANDY MONEY NOW. (CROWD OOHHING).
Stephen: OH, NO, HE DI-NT. NO, NO, NO. SERIOUSLY HE DID NOT VOTE FOR  SANDY RELIEF. AND WHEN IT COMES TO A COMMENT  LIKE THAT, THE N.J.GOV WASN'T  GOING TO FOR GET ABOUT IT. JIM?
SO IF SENATOR PAUL WANTS TO  START LOOKING AT WHERE HE'S  GOING TO CUT SPENDING TO AFFORD DEFENSE, MAYBE HE SHOULD START  LOOKING AT CUTTING THE PORK  BARREL SPENDING THAT HE BRINGS HOME TO KENTUCKY BUT I DOUBT HE  WOULD BECAUSE MOST WASHINGTON  POLITICIANS ONLY CARE ABOUT BRINGING HOME THE BACON SO THAT  THEY CAN GET RE-ELECTED.
Stephen: G.O.P.-EOWW! WELL, ANY RESPONSE TO THAT,  RANDY PAUL, PAUL?
THIS IS THE KING OF BACON  TALKING ABOUT BACON. (CROWD OOHING).
Stephen: SCORCHER. RAND PAUL, YOU REALLY HIT BELOW  THE BELT. WHICH ON CHRIS CHRISTIE IS  ANYWHERE SOUTH OF THE NIPPLES. SO, FOLKS, WE WANT TO HEAR FROM  YOU. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE-AWAY. TWEET US WITH THE HASH-TAG,  G.O.P., L.O.L., YOLO. AND KEEP AN UMBRELLA HANDY  BECAUSE WITH ANY LUCK THIS  G.O.-BYESING CONTEST WILL CONTINUE ALL THE WAY TO THE
