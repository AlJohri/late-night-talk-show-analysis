Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, IT'S GREETINGS LIKE  THAT THAT MAKE ME WANT TO  PUNCH A BABY IN THE FACE. THAT IS ACTUALLY A NICER  STORY THAN IT SOUNDS. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE PAYING  ATTENTION TO THE CALENDAR  YOU KNOW CHRISTMAS IS RIGHT  AROUND THE CORNER. YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE MY  HOUSE IS ALREADY DECORATED  FOR EASTER. PRO TIP, HIDE CHICKENS NOW  AND COME SPRING YOU'LL HAVE  HIDDEN EGGS. NOW FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH FOX  NEWS YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS  A WAR ON CHRISTMAS. BUT ON "THE COLBERT REPORT"  WE FIGHT BACK. THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON  GRINCHITUDE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW LADY ITS AND  GENTLEMEN, EVERY CHRISTMAS  HAS ITS SHARE OF YULE LOGJAMMERS BUT THIS YEAR IT  COMES FROM AN UNEXPECTED  SOURCE. POPE BENEDICT. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS  GUY WAS A GRINCH. IN HIS NEW BOOK JESUS OF  FLAZ RHETT THE THE POPE  CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL  STORY OF CHRISTMAS. FOR INSTANCE, HE WRITES THAT  THE 6th CENTURY MONK WHO  ESTABLISHED THE YEAR OF  JESUS'S BIRTH MADE A MISTAKE IN HIS CALCULATIONS BY  SEVERAL YEARS. THE ACTUAL DATE OF JESUS'S  BIRTH WAS SEVERAL YEARS  BEFORE. BIG DEAL. COME ON! JESUS IS A CELEBRITY. OF COURSE HE SHAVES A FEW  YEARS OFF. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, THAT JUST MEANS HE  WAS ALMOST 40 AND HE STILL  HAS THOSE ABS. THAT IS AMIR AGO EL. NOW THE POPE--   (APPLAUSE)
THE POPE ALSO WROTE THAT  ANGEL SPOKE THE WORDS  PROCLAIMING JESUS'S BIRTH INSTEAD OF SINGING THEM. SO APPARENTLY ACCORDING TO  THE POPE, THE BIRTH OF OUR  LORD DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THIS-- ♪ HALLELUJAH ♪  ♪.
Stephen: IT SOUNDED LIKE  THIS.
HOW YOU DOIN?
Stephen: DOESN'T FEEL THE  SAME. (APPLAUSE)  NOW AS A LIFELONG CATHOLIC I  HAVE STOOD BY THE CHURCH  DURING ITS VARIOUS TRIALS AND PUBLIC TRIBLATIONS. 9 DEBATE OVER BIRTH CONTROL,  THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE  CHURCH. AND A THIRD CONTROVERSY I'VE  TAKEN DRUGS TO FORGET. BUT FRANKLY I GOT NATIVE  TEED OFF WHEN THE POPE WROTE  THAT ALTHOUGH IT'S CLEAR  JESUS WAS BORN IN A MANAGER, THERE IS NO MENTION OF  ANIMALS IN THE GOSPEL. NO ANIMALS IN THE MANAGER? WHO DIED AND MADE YOU POPE? OH, ANOTHER POPE, OKAY, WELL  THAT'S-- THAT'S CONVENIENT. WELL, APPARENTLY THE POPE  HAS NOT READ THE GOSPEL OF  THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY. WHERE IT IS WRITTEN, QUOTE,  MARY NODDED PA RUM PUM PUM  PUM, THE OX AND LAMB KEPT TIME, PA RUM PUM PUM PUM. THE OX AND THE LAMB ARE THE  RHYTHM SECTION. IF THE OX AND THE LAMB  AREN'T THERE, WHO'S KEEPING  TIME, MARY? SHE'S BUSY NODDING. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. WHAT ELSE WASN'T IN THE  MANAGER, NO RED NOSED  REINDEER, NO MER-- MARY  KISSING SANTA CLAUS, NO FROSTY THE SNOWMAN SING  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. HEY, YOUR HOLINESS, YOU KNOW  WHAT ELSE IS NEVER MENTIONED  IN THE BIBLE? THE POPE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LET ME DOUBLE-CHECK HERE,  POPE, POPE, POPE, POPE, POPE,  NOPE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW  WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST  BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN HERE, I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE IS  A POPE. AND EVEN IF YOU WERE TRYING  TO BUZZ STOMP MY YULETIDE  BARN YARD, I WILL STILL  LEAVE OUT MILK AND COOKIES FOR YOU. MERRY CHRISTMAS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
