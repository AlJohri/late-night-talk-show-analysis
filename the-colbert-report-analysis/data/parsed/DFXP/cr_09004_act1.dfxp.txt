OH, YES! OH, I AM FEELING GOOD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN --
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ANYBODY ELSE DO SEE THAT  DEBATE LAST NIGHT? FOLKS, IT A WHOLE NEW HORSE  RACE! MITT SMOKED OBAMA! METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE,  MORMONS CAN'T SMOKE! AND FOLKS, AFTER LAST  NIGHT'S DEBATE IN DENVER OUR  IMAGE OF THESE TWO MEN HAS  COMPLETELY CHANGED. AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE  WHO KNOWS IT.
IT LOOKED LIKE ROMNEY  WANTED TO BE THERE AND  PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T WANT  TO BE THERE.
Stephen: YES! IT WAS LIKE OBAMA WASN'T  EVEN THERE. HE HASN'T DONE THIS POORLY  SINCE HE DEBATED CLINT  EASTWOOD. (LAUGHTER)  MEANWHILE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MEANWHILE, ROMNEY WAS THE  ALPHA MITT, SLAPPING OBAMA  AROUND. AND, ANYONE ELSE WHO GOT IN  MITT AWAY.
I'M SORRY, JIM, I'M GOING  TO STOP THE SUBSIDY TO PBS. I WILL STOP OTHER THINGS. I LIKE PBS. I LIKE BIG BIRD, I ACTUALLY  LIKE YOU TOO. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP ON  SPENDING MONEY FOR THINGS TO  BORROW FROM CHINA TO PAY FOR  IT.
Stephen: HE JUST TOLD THE  MODERATOR WHO WORKS AT PBS,  I'M GOING TO THROW YOUR ASS  OUT ON THE STREET, OLD MAN! YOU--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU, NOT ONLY YOU-- BUT ALL  THOSE FREELOADING MUPPETS. THAT TAKES NOT JUST ONE BALL,  BUT TWO, TWO ENORMOUS BALLS! (APPLAUSE)  BUT, FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I  ENJOYED THE TRIUMPH OF THE  WILLARD, WHAT I LOVED MOST  WAS THE HEARTWARMING PANT CRAPPING OVER AT MSNBC.
I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE  PRESIDENT. I THOUGHT HE WAS OFF HIS  GAME. I WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNED  TONIGHT.
THERE WASN'T, I DON'T  THINK, A SINGLE DIRECT  ATTACK AGAINST MR. ROMNEY  FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. NO DISCUSSION OF THE 47%.
AT ALL.
NO DISCUSSION OF  IMMIGRATION. NO DISCUSSION OF UNION  RIGHTS. NO DISCUSSION OF WOMEN'S  RIGHTS, NO DISCUSSION OF  BAIN.
WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT?
Stephen: OH, BREAK OUT  THE SOUR CREAM AND BACON  BITS, NATION, BECAUSE  MR. POTATO HEAD IS STEAMED! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW  WHAT? DO YOU KNOW WHY, I JUST GOT  TO GET ANOTHER TASTE OF  CHRIS MATTHEWS HERE. BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT LET ME  JUST-- I WANT TO JACK IN  RIGHT HERE OKAY, JACK INTO  HIM RIGHT THERE, SO I CAN FEAST ON HIS IMPOTENT RAGE.
TONIGHT WASN'T AN MSNBC  DEBATE WAS IT? IT JUST WASN'T. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS DOING  OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LET  ROMNEY GET AWAY IT WITH IT. THEY ARE PART OF YOUR 47%. YOU WANT TO-- YOU DON'T HAVE  ANY CHANCE, WHAT ARE YOU  TALKING ABOUT. WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT! HE SHOULD WATCH -- -- WITH  WAS ROMNEY DOING, WINNING. OBAMA SHOULD WATCH MSNBC.
Stephen: I'LL VOTE FOR  ANYTHING THAT MOVES! (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, I AM NOT SURPRISED  THAT ROMNEY CRUSHED IT. BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WAS  RIGHT IN HIS WHEELHOUSE. SOUL-CRUSHING. IN FACT, IT WAS SO TEDIOUS I  THINK MAN IN THE FRONT ROW  FELL ASLEEP. (LAUGHTER)  THE FIRST HALF HOUR, THE  FIRST HALF HOUR, FOLKS. (APPLAUSE)  THE FIRST HALF HOUR WAS AN  OR GEOOF TAX POLICY  MINUTISH-- ORGY WAS TAX  POLICY MINUTIA, AND THEY MOVED ON TO THE INTRICACIES  OF MEDICARE SOLVENCY IT WAS  OFF THE HOOK, IN THAT IT  WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO A  DIAL TONE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT HOWEVER WONKY IT GOT  LAST NIGHT THERE WAS NO MISS  TACKING THAT THERE WAS A  FIRE BREATHING LEFTIE ON THAT STAGE SPEWING HEATED  SOCIALIST RHETORIC.
I WILL NOT REDUCE THE  TAXES PAID BY HIGH INCOME  AMERICANS. REGULATION IS ESSENTIAL. YOU CAN'T HAVE A FREE MARKET  WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE  REGULATION. PREEXISTING CONDITIONS ARE  COVERED UNDER MY PLAN. AND WITH REGARDS TO HEALTH  CARE WA, WE DID IN  MASSACHUSETTS IS A MODEL FOR  THE NATION, STATE-BY-STATE.
Stephen: YES, MITT ROMNEY'S  HEALTH-CARE PLAN IS JUST  LIKE HIS POSITIONS, THE  DETAILS CHANGE  STATE-BY-STATE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW-- FOLKS, YOU KNOW  ME-- YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  YOU KNOW ME. AS A STANCH CONSERVATIVE I  CONDEMN ANY HELP CAN  WHO-- REPUBLICAN WHO  DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM  EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. BUT IT WORKED SO [BLEEP] IT. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES, I MEAN THE  ARGUMENTS--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE ARGUMENTS, THE ARGUMENTS  HARDLY MATTERED. WHAT COUNTS IS BODY LANGUAGE,  RIGHT MEGAN KELLY.
IT WAS AN INTERESTING  DIMIC TO SEE MITT ROMNEY  LOOKING MOSTLY OVER AT  PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE WAS MAKING HIS POINT. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA CHOOSING  TO LOOK MOSTLY AT JIM LEHRER  OR LOOKING DOWN. AND WHAT MESSAGE DO THE  VIEWERS AT HOME PICK UP ON  THAT.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S BODY  LANGUAGE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND  THAT EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE  WHICH WAS AN EXPRESSION, THOSE OF WHITE HOUSE FOLLOW  HIM WAS FAMILIAR W AS KIND  OF A HALF SMILE, NOT A  SMIRK-- .
Stephen: YES, BRIT, MITT  HAD A CONFIDENT HALF SMILE,  LIKE THIS. (LAUGHTER)  NOT A SMIRK LIKE THIS--   (LAUGHTER)  AND DEFINITELY NOT A BIG  BRIGHT RICK HUMAN SMILE LIKE THIS-- HUME SMILE LIKE THIS  (LAUGHTER)  SO ULTIMATELY, FOLKS,  CHOOSING THE LEADER OF THE  FREE WORLD IS CLEARLY ALL ABOUT HOW IT LOOKS. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID  NOT HAVE AN HOUR AND A HALF  TO WASTE LAST NIGHT, HERE'S  HOW IT LOOKS.
WE WELCOME PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND GOVERNOR ROMNEY. (APPLAUSE)  (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
Stephen: PRETTY MUCH  CAPTURES IT. NOW OF COURSE A LOT OF BELLY  ACRES ON THE LEFT,  INCIDENTALLY BELLYACHING NOT  COVERED UNDER ROMNEY'S PLAN, INSISTED ON PAYING ATTENTION  TO THE WORDS THEY SAID, AND  POINTED OUT THAT MITT  CHANGING ALMOST ALL OF HIS POSITIONS COULD BACKFIRE. LIKE THIS FROM NPR. ROMNEY GOES ON OFFENSE. PAYS FOR IT IN FIRST WAVE OF  FACT CHECKS. OH NO! MITT COULD LOSE THE FACT  CHECKING RACE. QUICK, SOME FACT CHECKER  SHOULD RESEARCH HOW MANY  ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THE  SWING STATE OF FACT  CHECKELSVANNIA HAS. BECAUSE-- BECAUSE I  THINK-- I THINK-- I THINK  IT'S EVEN FEWER THAN NORTH I  DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP]. FOLKS, THE FACT CHECK MAFIA  IS JUST A BET BECAUSE ROMNEY  WON BY PIVOTING. EXACTLY LIKE HIS SENIOR  ADVISOR ERIC FERNSTROM SAID  HE WAS GOING TO DO AFTER THE  PRIMARY.
EVERYTHING CHANGES. IF IS ALMOST LIKE AN  ETCH-A-SKETCH, YOU CAN KIND  OF SHAPE IT UP-- SHAKE IT UP  AND WE START ALL OVER AGAIN.
Stephen: AND EVERYONE  AGREES LAST NIGHT MITT WAS  PRETTY SKETCHY.
HE SAID THINGS THAT WERE  JUST NOT ACCURATE.
MITT ROMNEY PRESENTED  WITH US THE ULTIMATE  ETCH-A-SKETCH BEHAVIOR LAST  NIGHT.
ROMNEY HAS BEEN ACCUSED  OF ETCH-A-SKETCH. LAST NIGHT WAS HIS GREATEST  ACHIEVEMENT.
Stephen: LET ME SHOW YOU  JUST HOW GREAT AN  ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS. BEFORE THE DEBATE, MITT'S  CAMPAIGN SAID ROMNEY WILL  COME ACROSS AS EMPATHETIC. BUT HERE'S WHAT MITT HAS  BEEN PROMISING FOR THE LAST  TWO YEARS.
TAX CUTS FOR THE  WEALTHIEST AMERICANS. HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT SEEM  WARM AND FUZZY? WELL, YOU JUST NEED TO SHAKE  IT UP AS HARD AS MITT DID  LAST NIGHT.
SO-- GIVE IT A SHOT. OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   NOW LET'S SEE WHAT MITT'S  TAX PLAN LOOKS LIKE NOW. OKAY? JUST NEED TO GET MY TOOL  HERE. OKAY. HERE WE GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  PRESTO CHANGEO. (LAUGHTER)  NOW YOU SEE ROMNEY'S  POLICIES, NOW YOU DON'T. WE'LL BE RI
