I HAD AN IMPROPER  RELATIONSHIP WITH MY  BIOGRAPHER--   (LAUGHTER)  SPENT A LOT OF TIME ALONE WITH THE AUTHOR OF THESE  BOOKSMENT THERES WITH A  CONNECTION AND LET'S JUST  SAY HE GOT A LITTLE HANDSY. AND I DID THINKS-- THINGS I  NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO. BUT HAVE BEEN DOING FOR  DECADES. (LAUGHTER)  I'M SORRY. NOW FOLKS, EVEN I CAN  SOMETIMES GET A STORY WRONG. FOR EXAMPLE LAST WEEK I SAID  THE THREE BRANCHES OF  GOVERNMENT WERE EXECUTIVE,  JUDICIAL AND SANTA MARIA. IT, IN FACT, SHEMP. (LAUGHTER)  NOW I ALSO SAID THAT SUPER  PAC WOULD BE 9 DECIDING  FACTOR IN THE 2012 ELECTION. I MIGHT HAVE EVEN FOUNDED  ONE, COLBERT SUPER PAC. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER  OUR MOTTO, MAKING A BETTER  TOMORROW --
TOMORROW!
Stephen: WOW, I'M  SURPRISED. I DIDN'T REALLY MAKE THAT  BIG OF A DEAL OF IT. (LAUGHTER)  YOU SEE ME AND EVERYBODY  ELSE WHO HAD A SUPER PAC  THOUGHT WE WERE PLAYAS. WELL, TURNED OUT WE WERE  SCRUBBED. JIM?
YOU HAD THE SUPER PACS  SPENDING LITERALLY BILLIONS  OF DOLLARS, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DEFEAT THE  PRESIDENT WHILE THE  PRESIDENT WAS RE-ELECTED.
SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE LIKE  KARL ROVE AND OTHERS WHO  TOOK A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE SUPER PACS --
ROVE WAS IN DENIAL BUT  YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. HIS AMERICAN CROSSROAD  CROSSROADS-- ACCORDING TO  SOME FOUNDATION JUST 1.29%  OF THAT MONEY WENT TO CANDIDATES WHO ACTUALLY WON. 1.29%.
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE GUYS  THAT HE TOOK MONEY FROM ARE  CASINO OWNERS. THEY KNOW GUY WITH FLAT  KNOWSES AND BRASS KNUCKLES  WHO GOING TO WANT TO BE  KNOWN WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE  MONEY.
Stephen: KARL'S IN BIG  TROUBLE. (LAUGHTER)  THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HIS  THUMBS AND KARL IS ALMOST  ALL THUMBS. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  NATION--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND NATION, I  TOOK A LOT OF MONEY FOR MY  SUPER PACMENT AND MY 501 C 4 COLBERT SUPER PAC SHH WHICH  STANDS FOR SHH. MONEY FROM SOME ANONYMOUS  SCARY DONORS. THAT'S NOT PIXEL ATED,  THAT'S HIS FACE. AND FOLKS I'M SCARED. I THINK I WAS FOLLOWED TO  THE STUDIO TONIGHT. AND I PERSONALLY DON'T KNOWS  WHAT'S GOING TO-- WHAT WAS  THAT? OH MY GOD, THEY'RE TRYING TO  KILL ME. HOW DID THEY FIND OUT I WORK  AT THE COLBERT REPORT? (LAUGHTER)  LISTEN, FELLAS, I DIDN'T  WASTE YOUR MONEY. RUNNING A SUPER PAC IS  EXPENSIVE. WE HAVE LEGITIMATE COST. WE HAD HANDLING COSTS AND  LEGAL FEES. AND THE BIGGEST EXPENSE,  ALMOST $90,000 OF IT WAS FOR  THE COMMERCIALS THE SUPER PAC RAN WHILE I WAS KINDA  SORTA RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT  OF SOUTH CAROLINA. I WASN'T EVEN CHARGING THE  SUPER PAC THEN. JON STEWART WAS. THIS IS THE GUY YOU WANT,  NOT ME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU SON OF A PITCH! YOU'RE NOT PINNING THIS ON  ME, BROTHER.
Stephen: I'M NOT TAKE THE  FALL, JON. YOU HAD CONTROL OF THE SUPER  PAC.
Jon: FOR A WEEK!
Stephen: YOU BOUGHT A  ZEPPELIN.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT  MEETINGS DOWNWIND. I WAS JUST FOLLOWING YOUR  ORDERS!
Stephen: IN A  NONCOORDINATED WAY.
Jon: YES, OF COURSE,  NONCOORDINATED, COMPLETELY.
Stephen: WELL NOW THEY'RE  GOING TO KILL ONE OF US,  JON.
Jon: THEY WANT A HEAD ON  A PLATTER!
Stephen: WAIT. A HEAD ON A PLATTER? (LAUGHTER)  THEN LET'S GIVE THEM-- .
Jon: THE HAM.
Stephen: YES. HAM ROVE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE TRUSTED AND SALTED  ADVISOR.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING  FOR, KILL HIM!
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU DO  IT?
Jon: I CAN'T DO IT, IT'S  NOT KOSHER. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FINE, FINE. I'M SORRY, HAM ROVE. ONE OF US IS DEAD MEAT AND  YOU ALREADY ARE. GAH, GAH, GAH! GAH, GAH! GAH!
Jon: I WAS NEVER HERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OH, THESE HANDS, OH THESE  HANDS ARE COMING COVERED IN  HAM JUICE. OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD I NEED  A LAWYER. PLEASE WELCOME FORMER FCC  CHAIRMAN GENERAL COUNSEL FOR  THE McCAIN 2008 CAMPAIGN AND MY PERSONAL LAWYER TREVOR  POTTER, TREVOR, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR COMING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: TREVOR, TREVOR,  TREVOR. FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF ALL,  TREVOR, I JUST KILLED MY  CHIEF STRATEGIST. CAN YOU GET ME OFF?
AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT  ILLEGAL TO STAB A HAM. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELCOME TO  OBAMA'S AMERICA. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT, TREVOR, TREVOR,  I'M SCARED, OKAY. I'VE GOT A SUPER PAC AND A F  01 C 4 COLBERT SUPER PAC  SHH. AND I TOOK MONEY FROM SOME  SCARY GUYS. AND I JUST WANT OUT OF THE  GAME. HE WANT TO GET OUT OF THE  SUPER PAC BUSINESS. I CAN CLOSE DOWN MY SUPER  PAC.
SURE, YOU CAN DO THAT.
Stephen: OKAY, BUT I'VE  GOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THERE,  ALMOST $800,000. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP THAT  MONEY. WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?
WELL, YOU CAN USE IT FOR  ANY LEGAL PURPOSE. YOU COULD EVEN WRITE  YOURSELF A CHECK FOR THAT  WHOLE AMOUNT.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT  EVERYONE WILL KNOW BECAUSE  IF YOU REPORT THAT ON THE FEC REPORT FOR THE SUPER  PAC.
Stephen: BUT THAT'S NO  FUN AT ALL. THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING A  SUPER PAC IS SECRET MONEY,  USING IT ANYWAY YOU WANT,  TREVOR. IS THERE ANY WAY, AND I KNOW  IS CRAZY, THESE MIGHT BE THE  MAD RAMBLINGS OF A SIEVE LITIC BRAIN. BUT HEAR ME OUT, CAN I  SOMEHOW GIVE THE MONEY TO  MYSELF AND THEREBY HIDE IT  FOREVER FROM ALL EYES AND USE IT IN A WAY THAT I WISH?
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN.
Stephen: I KNEW IT. OKAY WA, DO WE HAVE TO DO? WHAT-- WHAT DO WE GOT TO DO?
WELL, YOU KNOW YOUR 501 C  4.
Stephen: COLBERT SUPER  PAC SHH.
IS THE SECRET MONEY.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO WE ARE WANT TO YOU  TRANSFER THE MONEY FROM YOUR  SUPER PAC OVER TO YOUR 501 C-HAD AND WHAT WE'LL DO IS  WHAT THE TAX LAWYERS CALL AN  AGENCY LETTER WHICH SIMPLY MEANS YOU WRITE A LETTER  THAT TELLS THE C-4 EXACTLY  WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY. AND IF YOU DO THAT, THE IRS  DOESN'T CONSIDER IT TO HAVE  BEEN THE C-4'S MONEY. AND IT DOESN'T END UP ON THE  TAX RETURN.
Stephen: IT GOES FROM MY  SUPER PAC INTO A 501 C 4  REASONS RIGHT, NOW SINCE EVERYONE KNOWS THE NAME OF  YOUR C-4. WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE  BET PER IF WE CREATED A  WHOLE NEW ANONYMOUS C-4 SO  THAT THE FIRST ONE TRANSFERS THE MONEY TO THE SECOND ONE,  AND THE SECOND ONE WHICH YOU  WILL ALSO RUN THEN DISPERSES  IT. THAT WAY WE'RE SURE NOBODY  CAN TRACE IT.
Stephen: SO I WRITE A  CHECK FROM MY SUPER PAC TO  MY 501 C 4 TO MY SECOND SECRET 501 C 4 AND BECAUSE I  SENT A LETTER ALONG THE WAY  SAYING HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TWO GUYS DO IT NEITHER I  NOR ME NOR ME IS RESPONSIBLE  FOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE  MONEY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I LOVE AMERICA. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO LET ME SEE IF I CAN MAKE  CLEAR WHAT'S HAPPENING. I HAVE GOT A 501 C 4 CALLED  SOL BETTER SUPER PAC SHH. I TAKE THE MONEY FROM THE  SUPER PAC, A PASS IT THROUGH  THE 501 C-4. (LAUGHTER)  INTO A SECOND UNNAMED 501 C-4. I PLACE ALL THE MONEY INSIDE  THAT SECOND UNNAMED 501 C-4  AND THROUGH THE MAGIC OF YOUR LAWYERING AND THE  PRESENT FEDERAL TAX CODE,  AFTER I CLOSE IT AND LOCK IT  THAT MONEY IS GONE FOREVER AND NO ONE EVER KNOWS WHAT  HAPPENED TO IT?
YOU'LL KNOW BUT NOBODY  ELSE WILL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, TREVOR  WHAT ABOUT THE IRS. DON'T THEY GET TO KNOW  EVERYTHING?
WELL, THE NICE THING  ABOUT THE AGENCY LETTER IS  THE LEGAL FICTION HERE IS THAT THE C-4 NEVER RECEIVED  THE MONEY AND NEVER SPENT  IT. SO YOUR NEW SECRET NAMELESS  C-4 WILL SEND A POSTCARD TO  THE IRS WITH ITS TAX RETURN ON IT.
Stephen: BUT THERE IS NO  MONEY INDICATED ON THIS.
THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE NO  NUMBERS BECAUSE IT NEVER HAD  ANY MONEY EVEN THOUGH IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH IT.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO I  HAVE TO TELL EVEN THE IRS  ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS MONEY?
NOTHING.
Stephen: WELL,  TREVOR-- THANKS FOR NOTHING. TREVOR POTTER, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
