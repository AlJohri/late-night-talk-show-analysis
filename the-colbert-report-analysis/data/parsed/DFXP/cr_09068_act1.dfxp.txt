Stephen: TONIGHT, A GITMO  INMATE FACES TRIAL. OR HAS A BIRTHDAY PARTY. NOT SURE, IT WAS REDACTED. THEN, JOHN KERRY IS THE NEW  SECRETARY OF STATE. OR THE PRESSURE HAS REALLY TAKEN  A TOLL ON HILLARY CLINTON. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST PAOLA ANTONELLI IS  A CURATOR AT THE MUSEUM OF  MODERN ART. I'LL ASK HER TO EXIT THROUGH THE  GIFT SHOP. [LAUGHTER] IT'S CHUCK HAGEL'S FIRST DAY AS  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. TOMORROW WE START THE TWO-MONTH  CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR HIS  SECOND DAY OF WORK. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO  HAVE YOU WITH US. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE HAVE TO DO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU WATCH THIS PROGRAM, AND I  CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU DO, YOU  KNOW THAT IF NOTHING ELSE I'M A COMPANY MAN. AND I COULD NOT BE PROUDER THAT  THIS  SHOW IS A PROFITMAKING TSUNAMI  FOR MY PARENT COMPANY VIACOM. [LAUGHTER] MAKE NO MISTAKE, I AM THE REASON  CEO PHILIPPE DAUMANN CAN AFFORD  HIS DAILY SAFFRON AND ROSEWATER SCROTUM DIPS. [LAUGHTER] FRESH AS A DAISY, SIR. FRESH AS A DAISY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WHEN CORPORATE CALLS AND  SAYS, "STEVEO WE NEED A SPONSOR  INTEGRATION FOR HALLS MENTHOLYPTUS ON YOUR SHOW  TONIGHT," I SAY, "AM I  CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO?"  THEY SAY, "YES." I SAY, "THEN I LOVE IT." [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, I HAVE TO PROTECT MY  REPUTATION AS A NEWSMAN. I CAN'T BE SELLING MY NAME TO  THE HIGHEST BIDDER. SO INSTEAD I'M SELLING MY  INTERN'S NAME. HALLS, GET OUT HERE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE  AMERICA'S NUMBER-ONE COUGH DROP,  HALLS?
MY NAME IS JAY.
Stephen: NOT ANYMORE. [LAUGHTER] OKAY, I'VE ALREADY FILED  PAPERWORK  TO LEGALLY CHANGE IT.
SO MY LEGAL NAME IS HALLS  MENTHOLYPTUS?
Stephen: WELL, TECHNICALLY,  IT'S HALLS MENTHOLYPTUS WITH  TRIPLE SOOTHING ACTION PRESENTS JAY THE INTERN. [LAUGHTER]
DOES THIS MEAN I GET PAID  NOW?
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY--  YOU'RE GETTING PAID IN AN  INTENSE, UPWARD COOLING OF THE NASAL PASSAGES THAT YOU  CAN FEEL WHEN YOU TAKE A BREATH.
DO I GET HEALTH CARE?
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK  THIS IS? THAT'S RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OKAY. NOW SAY IT.
I DON'T WANT TO.
Stephen: SAY IT!
LET THE COOL IN. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT, HALLS?
LET THE COOL IN. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: YEAH, LET IT IN. [LAUGHTER] THAT WASN'T SO HARD, WAS IT? HALLS MENTHOLYPTUS WITH TRIPLE  SOOTHING ACTION PRESENTS JAY THE  INTERN, EVERBODY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE'RE STILL FIGHTING  THE WAR ON TERROR-- BY THE WAY,  NAMING RIGHTS STILL AVAILABLE. CALL ME VELVEETA. [LAUGHTER] AND THE WAR ON TERROR JUST  TURNED 12 YEARS OLD, WHICH  EXPLAINS WHY IT'S SO INTO CONTROLLED PLANES. [LAUGHTER] -- INTO REMOTE CONTROLLED  PLANES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT OUR  ENDLESS BORDERLESS WAR AGAINST  AN EMOTIONAL STATE IS OUR PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY. EVEN THOUGH MANY HAVE WANTED TO  SEE GITMO CLOSED, INCLUDING  PRESIDENT OBAMA, DESPITE ALL LOGIC, IT REMAINS OPEN FOR  BUSINESS. IT'S THE RADIO SHACK OF THE WAR  ON TERROR. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU FOLLOW THE NEWS CLOSELY,  YOU ARE PROBABLY UNAWARE THAT  GITMO IS CURRENTLY HOSTING THE TRIAL OF 9-11 MASTERMIND KHALID  SHEIK MOHAMMED. FOR GODSAKE, KHALID, YOU'RE  APPEARING IN COURT-- COMB YOUR  SHOULDERS! [LAUGHTER] NOW ONE REASON YOU MAY NOT HAVE  HEARD ABOUT IT IS THAT NOT THE  EASIEST TRIAL TO COVER. FIRST, BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY A  TRIAL. IT'S A ONE-OF-A-KIND MILITARY  TRIBUNAL  DESIGNED BY PRESIDENT BUSH,  IMPLEMENTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND INSPIRED BY PRESIDENT KAFKA. [LAUGHTER] SEE, REPORTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED  IN THE COURTROOM. THEY HAVE TO WATCH THE TRIAL  FROM BEHIND SOUNDPROOFED GLASS  AND HEAR THE PROCEEDINGS ON A 40-SECOND DELAY. AND TO PROTECT NATIONAL  SECURITY, THE JUDGE OR A  SECURITY OFFICER IN THE  COURTROOM CAN HIT A MUTE BUTTON WHICH SHUTS OFF THE AUDIO TO THE  REPORTERS AND INDICATES THIS  BY MAKING A RED LIGHT ON THE JUDGE'S BENCH SPIN. THE RED LIGHT ALSO INDICATES  THAT ALL DRESS SHIRTS AND MEN'S  SLACKS ARE 20% OFF. BUT ON JANUARY 29TH, THE RED  LIGHT TURNED ON AND CUT THE  AUDIO, BUT-- AND THIS IS THE FUN PART-- NEITHER THE JUDGE,  NOR THE SECURITY OFFICER HAD  DONE IT, CAUSING THE LIVID AND CONFUSED JUDGE TO SAY, QUOTE  "NOTE FOR THE RECORD, THAT THE  40-SECOND DELAY WAS INITIATED NOT BY ME. IF SOME EXTERNAL BODY  IS TURNING THINGS OFF, IF  SOMEONE IS TURNING THE  COMMISSIONS OFF UNDER THEIR OWN VIEW OF WHAT THINGS OUGHT TO BE,  WITH NO REASON OR EXPLANATION,  THEN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE MEETING ABOUT WHO TURNS  THAT LIGHT ON OR OFF." [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, FIND OUT  WHO PUT THE DIMMER SWITCH ON  HABEUS CORPUS. [LAUGHTER] NOW, THE GOVERNMENT'S PROSECUTOR  SAID SHE COULD EXPLAIN WHO WAS  DOING IT BUT NOT IN OPEN  SESSION. OOO! OO! I THINK I KNOW! CAN I SOLVE THE PUZZLE?! LET'S SEE AHUUM. WELL, WHOEVER'S DOING IT, IT'S  GOT THE DEFENSE LAWYERS WORRIED  THAT SOMEONE "MIGHT BE LISTENING TO PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS  BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR CLIENTS  AT THE DEFENSE TABLE. C'MON, I REALIZE THESE MILITARY  TRIBUNALS ARE A LITTLE  UNCONVENTIONAL-- IN THAT THEY MAY NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE  GENEVA CONVENTIONS-- BUT IT'S  PARANOID TO IMAGINE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS EAVESDROPPING ON  YOU AT THE DEFENSE TABLE. THEY'RE EAVESDROPPING ON YOUR  ATTORNEY-CLIENT MEETING ROOMS. [LAUGHTER] HEY, THEY SAY JUSTICE IS BLIND,  BUT THEY NEVER SAID SHE'S DEAF. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OKAY, SO THE WHOLE THING'S BEING  SPIED ON AND CONTROLLED BY  UNSEEN FORCES. BIG DEAL. IT'S JUST LIKE "SURVIVOR,"  EXCEPT IN THIS CASE, NO ONE GETS  VOTED OFF THE ISLAND. BUT FOLKS, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT  FOR MANY THIS TRIAL HAS LOST ITS  LEGITIMACY. SO I SAY WE DO THE ETHICAL THING  AND LET THE DETAINEES GO FREE. THEN HUNT THEM DOWN WITH FLYING  DEATH BOTS. [LAUGHTER] HERE TO SHED LIGHT ON WHAT'S  GOING ON AT GITMO UNTIL HIS MIC  IS CUT BY UNSEEN FORCES IS FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL  OF THE UNITED STATES AND LEAD  COUNSEL FOR THE GITMO DETAINEES IN HAMDAN V. RUMSFELD NEAL  KATYAL. NEAL GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR COMING ON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, WATCH WHAT YOU  SAY, I HAVE A FEELING THAT THERE  ARE CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES POINTED AT US. DO WE KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON DOWN  AT GITMO? WHAT IS CONTROLLING THE SWITCH  NOW?
WE DON'T. WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS CONTROLLING  THE SWITCH. THE JUDGE DIDN'T KNOW. THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING.
Stephen: SEEMED TO COME AS  A SURPRISE TO HIM.
YES.
Stephen: IT'S A MILITARY  JUDGE AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO  IDEA WHERE THE MICROPHONES ARE COMING FROM.
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. IT REMINDS ME. THE ONLY PRECEDENT FOR IT IS THE  SOVIET CONSTITUTION OR IRANIAN  CONSTITUTION.
Stephen: WE'RE NOTHING LIKE  THE OLD SOVIET UNION. WE DON'T HAVE GULAGS IN SIGH  BEERA. WE HAVE GULAGS IN HE IS STONEA. [ LAUGHTER ] IS IT ULTIMATELY SUCH A BAD  THING. THESE GUYS ARE GUILTY. [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU NOT BELIEVE KSM IS  GUILTY?
I BELIEVE HE IS LIKELY GUILTY  AND THAT'S WHAT TRIALS ARE ALL  ABOUT.
Stephen: THE THING WITH  TRIALS IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE  FOUND INNOCENT. THAT'S THE ONE FLAW WITH OUR  JUSTICE SYSTEM, I BELIEVE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE.
THE BEAUTIVE TRIAL SYSTEM IS  THAT IT GIVES LEG MATCY AND IT  SAYS THIS PROSECUTION MADE A LOT OF SENSE. THEY ARE LIKE BASEBALL AND  STEROIDS. AT THIS POINT EVEN IF THE  PROSECUTORS HIT IT OUT OF THE  PARK THERE'S AN THE AS TERRIFIC SAYING WAIT THERE WERE SECRET  MIKE PHONES AND.
Stephen: IT'S AN EXCITING  GAME. MAYBE YOU SELL A LOT OF  MEMORABILIA. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE  HIDING WITH THE KILL SWITCH?
HEAVEN KNOWS. A LOT OF TIME IT'S NOT  PROTECTING SECURITY IT'S  PROTECTING PEOPLE'S REPUTATIONS OR OTHER THINGS. IT'S NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY  THING. ONE TIME A DETAINEE WROTE TO HIS  ATTORNEY AND THE GOVERNMENT  CLASSIFIED IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND ALL IT SAID WAS LEBRON JAMES  SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO THE CITIZENS  OF CLEVELAND FOR MOVE TOGETHER MIAMI HEAVMENT IT IT TOOK TWO  MONTHS TO DECLASSIFY THAT.
Stephen: WHY ARE WE NOT  HEARING ABOUT THIS TRIAL? THIS IS THE TRIAL OF CENTURY,  DEFINITE IT WILL THE WAR OF  CENTURY AND THIS IS THE GUY WHEN  STARTED.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE ACCUSED  IN THE WORST CRIMES IN THE  WORLD.
Steve: WHAT HAPPENS WITH  GITMO FROM NOW ON. 150, 160 GUYS YOU. IS IT STAND OUT PRISON. ARE THEY THERE FOAMP NOW?
THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED  SEVEN PEOPLE IN 11.5 YEARS AND  EVEN THOSE CONVICTIONS HAVE MOSTLY BEEN REVERSED. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE PEOPLE  WILL STAY AND NOT BE TRIED WHICH  IS THE REAL INJUSTICE. THE VICTIMS OF 9/11 ZERVET  TRIALS AND REAL TRIALS AND BEEF  NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PULL IT OFF.
Stephen: IS IT JUST GOING  TO TURN INTO A TERRORIST  RETIREMENT SNOAM.
LOOKS LIKE --
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL  LOCATION.
IT IS. THAGE GHANAS ARE VERY NICE D THE  IGUANAAS ARE VERY
