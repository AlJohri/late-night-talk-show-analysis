Stephen: TONIGHT, A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN SOUTH AMERICA. HAVE SOCCER PLAYERS REGAINED THE USE OF THEIR HANDS? THEN, REPUBLICANS  ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY BURNING THE MIDNIGHT OIL. AND MY GUEST, SCIENCE WRITER STEVEN JOHNSON HAS A NEW BOOK AND TV SERIES CALLED "HOW WE GOT TO NOW." I'LL TALK TO HIM WHEN I GET TO THEN. ( LAUGHTER ) THE UPCOMING "STAR WARS "MOVIE IS TITLED "THE FORCE AWAKENS." IT FELL ASLEEP DURING "THE PHANTOM MENACE." THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT EVERYBODY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US ( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") THANK YOU, HEROES.  THANK YOU, IT-GETTERS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.  IT'S A BIG NIGHT, THERE'S A LOT TO COVER. NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW-- AND I HOPE YOU DO-- YOU KNOW THAT NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS TOUGHER ON CRIME THAN YOURS TRULY. I SAY LOCK THEM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY. ALSO, CLEARLY, TOUGH ON KEYS. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THIS WEEK, A DANGEROUS FUGITIVE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.
THE 90-YEAR-OLD MAN BUSTED FOR FEEDING THE HOMELESS. ARNOLD ABBOTT IS HIS NAME. HE FACES POSSIBLE JAIL TIME AND $500 FINE FOR PREPARING MEALS FOR THE NEEDY IN A CHURCH KITCHEN. A NEW ORDINANCE IN FT. LAUDERDALE OUTLAWS GROUPS FROM SHARING FOOD WITH THE HUNGRY.
Stephen: BUSTED FOR FEEDING THE HOMELESS IN PUBLIC!
Audience: BOOING.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, BOOO! I'M ANGRY AT HIM, TOO. I SAY IF THE HOMELESS WANT TO EAT THEY SHOULD DO IT IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN WHEREVER THOSE PEOPLE LIVE. AND THIS MONSTER CANNOT CLAIM HE DID NOT KNOW BETTER BECAUSE HE WAS DOING ALL THIS OUT OF A CHURCH KITCHEN. SO, CLEARLY, HE KNOWS WHAT JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW, "FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT. I WAS THIRSTY AND-- LOOK OUT! THE COPS ARE HERE. HIDE THE LOAVES AND THE FISHES!" AND I AM GLAD-- THEY CAUGHT UP WITH HIM EVENTUALLY. AND I AM GLAD TO HEAR THE POLICE USED MAXIMUM FORCE TO TAKE THE PERP DOWN.
ONE OF THE POLICE OFFICERS CAME OVER AND SAID, "DROP THAT PLATE, RIGHT NOW." AS THOUGH I WAS CARRYING A WEAPON.
Stephen: OH, FOOD IS MUCH WORSE THAN WEAPONS IN FLORIDA. IF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAD FED A GUY IN A HOODIE,   HE'D BE IN JAIL. AND, FOLKS, FT. LAUDERDALE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE MISS YOU, GEORGE. FOLKS, FT. LAUDERDALE NEEDS THESE LAWS. JUST ASK FT. LAUDERDALE'S MAYOR.
WE ENFORCE THE LAWS HERE IN FT. LAUDERDALE.
THEY WILL BE ARRESTED. IF THEY BREAK THE LAW AND IT'S OBSERVED BY ONE OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO ARREST.
THE MAYOR SAID HE NEEDS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE GOOD OF ALL PEOPLE IN FT. LAUDERDALE, INCLUDING TAXPAYERS AND TOURISTS WHO WANT TO USE PARKS AND BEACHES WITHOUT BEING OVERRUN BY THE HOMELESS.
Stephen: EXACTLY. MAYOR SEILER MUST PROTECT FT LAUDERDALE'S TOURISM INDUSTRY AND A BUNCH OF DRUNK PEOPLE URINATING ON  THE BEACH IS THAT INDUSTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE BEACH IS THAT INDUSTRY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NEVER ONCE WENT TO SPRING BREAK. BESIDES, FT. LAUDERDALE IS REALLY LOOKING OUT FOR THE HOMELESS.
THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. THE EXPERTS HAVE ALL SAID-- IF YOU ARE GOING TO SIMPLY FEED THEM OUTDOORS TO GET THEM FROM BREAKFAST TO LUNCH TO DINNER, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS ENABLING THAT CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS.
Stephen: YES, BY FEEDING THEM, ABBOTT IS CAUSING THEM TO BE HOMELESS. HE'S REALLY A FOOD PUSHER. AND FOR DECADES,   THIS SERIAL OFFENDER-- I ASSUME HE SERVES BREAKFAST--WAS DOWN IN  HIS COOK LAB GETTING PEOPLE HOOKED ON THE PRODUCTS OR AS IT'S KNOWN BY ITS STREET NAMES, GRUB,  NOSH, CHOW. CHASING THE NUTRITIONAL DRAGON SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE SO ADDICTED, THEY NEEDED THEIR FIX THREE TIMES A DAY. AND WITH HARDENED COOKS LIKE GRANDPA HERE, THESE HOMELESS WILL JUST WANT MORE AND MORE. THEY'LL COME TO EXPECT FOOD WHENEVER THEY SEE HUMANS AROUND. OH, THEY'RE SMART LITTLE CRITTERS. SOME OF THEM EVEN KNOW HOW TO PRY THE LID OFF A TRASH CAN. SO, FT. LAUDERDALE, DO WHAT I DO AT THE END OF THE DAY-- TIE YOUR HUMANITY IN A BAG, HANG IT IN A TREE. THAT WAY THEY CAN'T GET AT IT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY MUSIC SOOTHES THE SAVAGE BEAST, BUT I PREFER TO SNORT GROUND-UP ZOPICLONE. THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH  DR. STEPHEN T. COLBERT D.F.A. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FIRST, FOLKS A DISCLAIMER-- I AM NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. I HAVE AN HONORARY DOCTORATE IN FINE ARTS. ( LAUGHTER ) I CAN'T TREAT YOUR RASH, BUT I CAN COMPARE IT FAVORABLY TO A JACKSON POLLOCK. AS ALWAYS, CHEATING DEATH IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. PRESCOTT-- THE MORE PILLS YOU TAKE, THE MORE CHANCES YOU HAVE TO WIN. ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST UP, AGING. FOLKS, NOBODY WANTS TO GET OLDER. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT A BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT THAT ALLOWS SCIENTISTS TO REVERSE THE AGING PROCESS IN MICE. WHICH MEANS YOU CAN NOW TURN BACK THE CLOCK AND RELIVE THE EARLY VITAL DAYS OF YOUR RODENT INFESTATION. EVEN BETTER, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE STUDY, HARVARD PROFESSOR OF GENETICS, DAVID SINCLAIR, SAYS THIS AGE REVERSAL COULD WORK IN HUMANS. AND I BELIEVE HIM. BECAUSE  THIS IS WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO. ACCORDING TO HIS STUDY, THE SECRET LIES IN A MOLECULE CALLED N.M.N. BECAUSE WHEN SCIENTISTS FED THE MOLECULE TO MICE, THEY NOTICED IT REVERSED AGING COMPLETELY IN THEIR MUSCLES, MEANING THIS DRUG COULD GIVE YOU THE MUSCLE TONE OF A 20-YEAR-OLD AND ALLOW YOU TO SPEND A WHOLE OTHER LIFETIME NOT GOING TO THE GYM. ( LAUGHTER ) IF THE PROMISE OF THIS RESEARCH IS REALIZED, PEOPLE EVERYWHERE COULD INCREASE THEIR LIFESPAN TO AGES UNSEEN IN HUMAN HISTORY. SO THERE WILL BE SO MANY PEOPLE TURNING 100, THAT WILLARD SCOTT AND SMUCKERS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN CHANNEL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, YES, WILLARD SCOTT WILL STILL BE AROUND, AND, YES, WILLARD SCOTT IS STILL AROUND. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, WITH MANY FEWER PEOPLE DYING AND JUST AS MANY BEING BORN THE FIGHT FOR SCARCE RESOURCES IS GOING TO GET TOUGHER, WHICH IS WHY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICAL IS PROUD TO INTRODUCE ITS AGE-REVERSAL SUPPLEMENT, VACSA-POINTY-STICK.  IF YOUR VIRULE 130-YEAR-OLD BODY IS BACKED INTO A CORNER  FENDING OFF STARVING HOARDS CLAMORING FOR A BITE OF YOUR SQUIRREL CARCASS, JUST ADMINISTER A DOSE OF VACSA-POINTY-STICK. REPEAT AS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE HARMFUL OTHER PEOPLE. SIDE EFFECTS OF VACSA-POINTY-STICK INCLUDE MAHOGA-KNEES, CHICKEN FINGERS, AND THE OXFORD COMA. SECONDLY FIRST UP, WOMEN'S HEALTH.
OH!
Stephen: FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED THE FIGHT AGAINST BREAST CANCER. IN 2010, NOT ONLY DID I RACE FOR THE CURE BUT WHEN NO ONE WAS LOOKING, I ALSO TOOK A CAB FOR CURE. ( LAUGHTER ) AS A CONFIRMED BOSOM BUDDY I WAS THRILLED TO HEAR A STORY ABOUT THE CHILEAN CITY OF ANTOFAGASTA WHICH HAD A WATER SOURCE THAT TURNED OUT TO BE LOADED WITH SOME EXTRAS.
THE WATER THERE CONTAINED 80 TIMES THE ARSENIC LEVELS RECOMMENDED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS A RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF ARSENIC, AND IT'S NOT ZERO. ( LAUGHTER ) THE TOWN STARTED USING THAT WATER IN 1958, AND FORTUNATELY FOR RESIDENTS, THE TOXIN WAS DISCOVERED IMMEDIATELY 12 YEARS LATER. BUT EVERY MUNICIPAL POISONING STORY HAS A SILVER LINING.
SURPRISINGLY, THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THE CHEMICAL WAS LINKED TO A 50% DROP IN DEATHS FROM BREAST CANCER.
Stephen: FOLKS, THIS IS FANTASTIC NEWS. FINALLY, A FEEL-GOOD STORY ABOUT INDUSTRIAL RUNOFF. SURE, YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD SOLVENT PLANT MAY HAVE CREATED SEXUALLY AMBIGUOUS TROUT, BUT THEIR BREASTS ARE CANCER FREE. AND, FOLKS, WHEN YOU THINK KNOWN TOXINS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GUN TO MY HEAD? SURE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN-- FOLKS, WHEN YOU THINK KNOWN TOXINS, YOU THINK PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS. WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT, PRESCOTT IS PROUD TO INTRODUCE CHERNOBYL SPRINGS. WITH MORE THAN A MILLION TIMES THE RECOMMENDED DAILY ALLOWANCE OF VITAMIN U-235. IT WILL MARIE CURIE WHAT AILS. IT EVEN BEAT EVIAN IN A BLIND TASTE TEST IN THAT ALL TASTERS WERE RENDERED BLIND. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS DOES IT CURE CANCER? WE HAVE NO IDEA. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IT CAUSES CANCER, SO IF IN A FEW YEARS YOU DON'T GET CANCER, CONGRATULATIONS. IT CURED YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) SIDE EFFECTS OF CHERNOBYL SPRINGS INCLUDE UKRAINE IN THE MEMBRANE. ATOMIC FIREBALLS, AND BONUS EAR. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR CHEATING DEATH, BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICAL. PRESCOTT-- YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT'S A BABOON KIDNEY. UNTIL NEXT TIME, I'LL SEE YOU IN HEALTH!
