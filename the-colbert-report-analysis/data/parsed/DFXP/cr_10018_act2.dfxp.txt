Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NATION, I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. THE TRUTH IS, I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH BUGS. NOT JUST IN THE BACKYARD SHED WHERE I STORE MY COLLECTION OF DECORATIVELY SHATTERED OREOS. FOR YEARS, SCIENTISTS HAVE TOLD US UP TO 75% INSECTS MAY BE INVOLVED IN SAME-SEX SEXUAL INCIDENTS. ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, THOSE BILLIONS OF INSECTS ARE HAVING GAY SEX ACCIDENTALLY. THAT'S A RELIEF. IT'S ALL JUST ONE BIG MISUNDERSTANDING. I'M NOT SURPRISED. BUGS ARE ALWAYS GETTING IT WRONG. LOOK AT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES-- HEY, Bs, STOP SCREWING THOSE BIRDS. THEY'RE NOT GIANT BEES. , AND FOLKS, IT'S HAPPENING, BECAUSE THE BUGS ARE IN SUCH A RUSH TO REPRODUCE THEY CONOT TAKE ENOUGH TIME TO INSPECT THEIR POTENTIAL MATE'S GENDER. SEE, THERE'S NOTHING GAY THERE. IT'S JUST A NORMAL MANLY DESIRE TO BANG EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. AND ONCE WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD, WE NEVER ASK FOR DIRECTIONS. AM I RIGHT, LADIES? THE TV MAN EXPLAINS MORE.
THE FEMALE PARASITIC WASP IS READY TO MATE. HER IRRESISTIBLE PERFUME IS DESIGNED TO ATTRACT ALL AVAILABLE MALES. JUST AS THE FEMALE SIGNALS HER ADMIRATION, ANOTHER MALE RUSHES IN TO CLAIM THE REWARD. FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS, HE DOESN'T NOTICE HE'S TRYING TO MATE WITH A MALE. HE DOESN'T REALIZE BECAUSE THE SECOND MALE, AFTER CONTACT WITH THE FEMALE, NOW SMELLS LIKE HER.
Stephen:  HEY, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, SCENT IS CONFUSING. YOU WALK PAST THE NORDSTROM'S PERFUME COUNTER AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DRY HUMPING A PILE OF CASHMERE SWEATERS. INSECTS ARE NOT INTO SOME GAY LIFESTYLE. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE OUT THERE HAVING PARADES, EXCEPT FOR THE ANTS. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON ANTS. SOME OF THEM ARE TOTAL QUEENS. FOLKS, STET YOUR D.VR BECAUSE TONIGHT I AM ISSUING A RARE AND HISTORIC APOLOGY TO THE GAYS OVER HERE. THE GAYS, I AM SORRY. FOR YEARS I HAVE CONSIDERED MAN-ON-MAN SEX A DEPLORABLE, UNHOLY ABOMINATION. GIRL-ON-GIRL-- HEY, I'M NOT DEAD. BUT NOW, NOW I KNOW YOU WEREN'T BORN GAY. SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD, YOU JUST HAD A SAME-SEX ATTRACCIDENT. MAYBE YOU MET SOMEONE NICE, WENT ON A COUPLE DATES, MADE YOU LAUGH, SMELLED GOOD, ONE THING I P THING LED TO ANOTHER AND YOU'RE BACK AT YOUR PLACE GOING HEY, THIS PERSON HAVING SEX WITH ME IS A GUY. BUT OUT OF POLITENESS, YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING. MONTHS PASS, YOU MIGHT AS WELL INTRODUCE HIM TO YOUR FAMILY, AND WHEN THEY ASK WHY YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS A GUY-FRIEND, YOU BLURT OUT, "I MEANT TO DO THIS." BECAUSE EVEN MARRYING A DUDE IS LESS EMBARRASSING THAN ADMITTING YOU DIDN'TER TO CHECK UNDER THE HOOD. SO HOMOSEXUALS, I AM SORRY. AND I AM MAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT THAT GAYS ARE EXACTLY LIKE INSECTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
