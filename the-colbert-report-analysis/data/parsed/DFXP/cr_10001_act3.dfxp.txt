WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY! WE'RE HERE TALKING TO VINCE GILLIGAN THE CREATOR OF "BREAKING BAD" ABOUT LAST NIGHT AND THE ENTIRE SERIES. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS,-- AGAIN, SPOILER ALERT-- ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT WALT DOES TO SKYLER IS "I DID IT FOR ME." WHY DOES THAT SEEM LIKE THE NICEST THING HE HAS SAID TO HIS FAMILY ALL FIVE SEASONS?
I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS HE'S DONE IN THIS SHOW IS LIE TO THEM SO MUCH AND DESTROY THE FAMILY THROUGH LIES AS WELL AS ACTION. AND TO DO HIS WIFE THE COURTESY OF BEING HONEST, TO SHOW HER THAT RESPECT ONCE AT LEAST BEFORE IT'S ALL OVER.
Stephen: IS THAT THING WHEN HE SAYS "I DID IT FOR ME," IS THAT NECESSARILY A BAD THING OR A BAD MOTIVATION? BECAUSE, I MEAN, I DO THIS FOR ME. (LAUGHTER) DON'T YOU DO YOUR SHOW FOR YOU?
YEAH.
Stephen: IS THE SHOW YOUR BLUE METH?
THE SHOW IS -- YOU KNOW, THE SHOW IS MY BLUE METH AND NOW I NEED TO BE IN SOME SORT OF 12-STEP RECOVERY PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S OVER. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: THE FAME OF THE LAST EPISODE WAS CALLED "FELINA" FROM MARTY ROBBINS HIT ♪ DOWN IN THE WEST TEXAS TOWN OF EL PASO, I FELL IN LOVE WITH A MEXICAN GIRL ♪ HE HAS TO COME BACK BECAUSE THE BAD GUYS HAVE CAPTURED HIS GIRLFRIEND-- OR THE AUTHORITIES HAVE-- TO DRAW HIM BACK AND HE COMES BACK FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND IN THE SONG KNOWING HE'S GOING TO DIE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WALT COMES BACK. DOES HE COME BACK FOR JESSE, TO SAVE HIM? OR IS HE COMING BACK FOR THE BLUE METH? IS THE BLUE METH HIS GIRLFRIEND?
I THINK -- TO USE "LORD OF THE RINGS" TERMS --
Stephen: PLEASE. PLEASE.
I THINK HE'S COMING BACK FOR HIS PRECIOUS AND HIS PRECIOUS IS THE BLUE METH IN THE LAB, THE LAB HE CONSTRUCTED. WHEN HE COMES BACK, I THINK HE'S COMING BACK TO SET THINGS RIGHT FINANCIALLY FOR HIS FAMILY AND AFTER THAT HE JUST WANTS TO WIPE OUT UNCLE JACK AND HIS GANG AND HE REALIZES IN THE HOUR-- IN THIS FINAL HOUR-- THAT JESSE IS STILL ALIVE AND HE WANTS TO WIPE OUT JESSE, TOO. BUT IN OTHER WONDERFUL WESTERN TERMS, IT'S A BIT LIKE THE END OF "THE SEARCHERS." ALL THROUGHOUT "THE SEARCHERS" JOHN WAYNE IS CHASING AFTER NATALIE WOOD'S CHARACTER AND SHE'S BEEN TAKEN BY THE COMANCHES AND HE KEEPS SAYING "WHEN I FIND HER, I'M GOING TO KILL HER." AND AT THE LAST MINUTE WHEN HE CEASE HER HE SWEEPS HER UP IN HIS ARMS AND SAYS "LET'S GO HOME." AND IT'S A TEAR JERKING WONDERFUL ENDING AND WE STOLE FROM THE BEST.
Stephen: VINCE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. I KNOW YOU CAME HERE, LIKE -- YOU FLEW OUT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AFTER -- DID YOU PARTY ALL NIGHT?
I PARTIED UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT. I'M A LITTLE -- LITTLE -- A LITTLE TIRED TODAY BUT I FLY -- I'D FLY 10,000 MILES FOR YOU, STEPHEN. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: MY FAVORITE GUEST OF ALL TIME, VINCE GILLIGAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. VINCE GILLIGAN, "BREAKING BAD" IN ITS ENTIRETY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
