Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. NATION...
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: PLEASE, SIT DOWN,  EVERYBODY. PLEASE, WE'VE GOT TO GET GOING. FOLKS, NATION, LOCK YOUR DOORS  AND BOARD UP YOUR WINDOWS  BECAUSE AMERICA IS IN A STATE OF  PANIC. I HOPE YOU'RE WEARING A CLEAN  DIAPER BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES  GOVERNMENT IN COOPERATION WITH CABLE NEWS HAS ONCE AGAIN TAKEN  US TO CODE BROWN. JIM?
HIGH ALERT. IS AN ATTACK IMMINENT?
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN PUT ON  NOTICE. THEY MAY NOT BE SAFE THIS MONTH.
A GLOBAL TRAVEL ALERT IS NOW  IN EFFECT FOR ALL AMERICANS  AROUND THE WORLD. THAT'S AFTER SOURCES SAY THERE'S  GROWING INTELLIGENCE THAT  AL-QAEDA IS PLANNING AN ATTACK. AS A PRECAUTION, THE U.S. IS  CLOSING 22 EMBASSIES AND  CONSULATES.
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY AN ATTACK  COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE IN THE  WORLD AT ANY TIME. IT COULD HAPPEN LITERALLY AT ANY  MOMENT.
Stephen: YES, AN ATTACK IS  IMMINENT, ANY MOMENT, ANYWHERE,  ANY TIME. LOOK TO YOUR LEFT. LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT. BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE COULD BE  TERRORISTS. AND WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY IN THE  MIDDLE WHO KEEPS LOOKING AROUND  SO MUCH? WHAT'S HE PLANNING? FOLKS, THIS WARNING IS EXACTLY  WHY WE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING,  SURRENDERED OUR PRIVACY AND LET  THE N.S.A. TURN THE CONSTITUTION INTO A CHOOSE YOUR OWN  ADVENTURE. SO WE CAN GET CONCRETE,  ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE LIKE  THIS.
AL QAEDA APPEARS TO BE  PLANNING SOMETHING BIG ALTHOUGH  WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT TARGET OR THE EXACT METHOD.
WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE TIME  OR DATE OR TARGET OF ANY ATTACK.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THE  EXACT DATE, THE EXACT LOCATION  THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR OR THE NATURE OF IT. ARE THEY GOING TO ATTACK  EMBASSIES OR HOTELS? WE JUST DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: THANK YOU N.S.A. NOW WE KNOW AMERICANS JUST NEED  TO AVOID "THIS" AREA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, WITHOUT ANY DETAILS, I'M  NOT EVEN SURE HOW PANICKED I'M  SUPPOSED TO BE. AT LEAST DURING THE BUSH YEARS I  COULD LOOK AT THIS HELPFUL CHART  AND KNOW THAT MY SPHINCTER TIGHTNESS WAS ORANGE BUT EVEN  THAT'S GONE NOW BECAUSE OBAMA  GAVE ALL THOSE COLORS TO THE GAYS FOR THEIR RAINBOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT DESPITE THE UNCERTAINTY,  NOTHING IS BEING LEFT TO CHANCE. IN FACT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT  ANNOUNCED THE CLOSED U.S. EMBASSIES WILL REMAIN SHUT  THROUGH SATURDAY DUE TO AN  ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION. YES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMAIN  ABUNDANTLY CAUTIOUS UNTIL  SATURDAY. AFTER THAT, THE TERRORISTS WOULD  HAVE TO REBOOK THEIR FLIGHTS. AND THAT'S A $100 CHANGE FEE. PLUS THEY'D HAVE TO TAKE OFF  WORK AGAIN AND RESCHEDULE THE  BABY-SITTER. IT'S A NIGHTMARE. ANYWAY, YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF YOU  WATCH THIS SHOW, YOU KNOW I AM A  BORN SPORTSMAN. IN FACT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MANY  DOCTORS THAT I HAVE ATHLETE'S  FEET. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FIRST UP ON THE SPORT REPORT,  BASEBALL. FOLKS, LIKE ANY RED-BLOODED  AMERICAN MALE I'M AN AVID  WATCHER OF OUR NATIONAL PASTIME HUZZAH HUZZAH FOR THE  WHITE-STOCKINGS. GIVE WHAT-FOR TO THOSE FINKS ON  THE BROOKLYN BRIDEGROOMS BUT  LATELY OUR BELOVED GAME OF BALL-AND-STICK OR ROUNDERS, AS  THE KIDS CALL IT, HAS HAD TO  CLEAN HOUSE AFTER ANOTHER PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG  SCANDAL. PERSONALLY I WAS ALL FOR  WATCHING A BUNCH OF  WEAPONS-GRADE HUMANOID MONSTERS  TURN THIS SPORT INTO THEIR OWN PERSONAL PACIFIC RIM BUT  UNFORTUNATELY IT IS AGAINST THE  RULES AND TODAY THE HAMMER CAME DOWN ON ONE OF THE GAME'S MOST  RECOGNIZABLE LARGER THAN NORMAL  FACES.
THEY'VE ANNOUNCED THAT THIRD  BASEMAN ALEX RODRIGUEZ OF THE  NEW YORK YANKEES AND I'M READ INNING DIRECTLY HAS BEEN  SUSPENDED WITHOUT PAY FOR THE  REMAINDER OF THE 201 SEASON AND ALSO POST SEASON AND THE ENTIRE  2014 SEASON AS WELL. FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE JOINT  PREVENTION TREATMENT PROGRAM AND  BASIC AGREEMENT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. ALEX RODRIGUEZ OR AROD HAS BEEN  SUSPENDED THROUGH THE END OF  NEXT SEASON SO IF HE'S ON YOUR FANTASY BASEBALL TEAM IT IS TIME  TO SWAP HIM OUT FOR A DIFFERENT  HOBBY. SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE AN ADULT AND  YOUR WIFE MISSES YOU. NOW RODRIGUEZ HAS ALLEGEDLY BEEN  CONNECTED TO ALLEGED DOPING  OPERATIONS AT BIOGENESIS AN ALLEGED MIAMI-BASED ALLEGED  ANTIAGING CLINIC ALLEGEDLY. FOR THAT M.L.B. BASEBALL  SUSPENDED HIM A TOTAL OF 211  GAMES. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS WHAT A SINGLE  BASEBALL GAME FEELS LIKE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, FOLKS, BASEBALL'S  CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS MAKE  THE FACTS OF THIS CASE A BIT OF "HE SAID, SHE SAID, THEN HE  FLIPPEDDED OUT IN A ROID RAGE  AND PUNCHED A WATER HEATER" BUT THE LEAGUE'S EVIDENCE AGAINST  RODRIGUEZ IS RUMORED TO BE  DAMNING.
THEY PROBABLY HAVE EVIDENCE  THAT HE TAMPERED WITH THE  INVESTIGATION AND MAYBE EVEN TAMPERED WITH SOME OF WITNESSES.
THEY FEEL HE NOT ONLY  VIOLATED THE DRUG POLICY. HE THEN TRIED TO GO AROUND AND  BUY UP EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM.
Stephen: SERIOUS STUFF. THE LEAGUE GREW EVEN MORE  SUSPICIOUS LAST SUMMER WHEN  RODRIGUEZ WON HIS 7th TOUR DE FRANCE. PERSONALLY, FOLKS, I THINK THE  BASEBALL'S MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE  HERE. A TWO-YEAR SUSPENSION MAY SOUND  LIKE A LOT TO YOU AND ME BUT NOT  TO SOMEONE WORKING SO HARD TO LIVE FOREVER. RODRIGUEZ CAN JUST WAIT BASEBALL  OUT IN HIS PRIVATE HERMETIC  CHAMBER OF FETAL BOVINE SERUM. ON A PERSONAL NOTE MY THOUGHTS  GO OUT TO AROD. I'M SURE HE'LL HAVE A TOUGH TIME  BEING AWAY FROM THE GAME HE  LOVES WHILE CONTINUING TO PLAY THROUGH HIS APPEAL AND  COLLECTING $61 MILLION IN  GUARANTEED SALARY EVEN IF HIS  CAREER IS OVER. BUT REMEMBER THANKS TO  BIOGENESIS HE HAS TO SPREAD THAT  $61 MILLION OUT OVER THE NEXT 2,000 YEARS. OF COURSE, FOLKS, BASEBALL IS  NOT THE ONLY HOT-WEATHER GAME. AS YOU KNOW, EVERY SUMMER ON  THIS SHOW I ANNOUNCE WHAT SPORT  WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE OBSESSED  WITH. IN YEARS PAST IT WAS TIMBER  SPORTS, CANOE DANCING, DRESSAGE,  AND THE SHORT-LIVEDDED HORSE  CANOE-CHOPPING. WELL, GET READY, FOLKS, BECAUSE  THIS SUMMER WE ARE ALL GOING TO  BE INTO THE HOTTEST NEW GAME OUT  THERE. COMBAT JUGGLING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] KIDS LOVE THIS. KIDS LOVE COMBAT JUGGLING. NOW, I KNOW COMBAT JUGGLING  SOUNDS COMPLICATED SO LET ME  BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU. IT'S JUGGLING PLUS COMBAT. JIM?
WHAT A MOVE THERE. (SCREAMING).
Stephen: BOOYAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT IS SOME PRIMO COME-JUG. YOU JUST GOT SERVED, ONE  IMAGINES. FOLKS, THIS IS THE SPORT FOR YOU  IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN SOMEONE  JUGGLING AND THOUGHT, "MAN, I'D LIKE TO PUNCH THAT GUY."  AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS. COM-JUG IS HARD CORE. COMBATANTS MUST DISRUPT THEIR  OPPONENT'S JUGGLING BY THROWING  A CLUB HIGH IN THE AIR AND ATTACKING THEM BEFORE CATCHING  THEIR CLUB AND RESUMING A  THREE-CLUB JUGGLE COMBINING THE SKILL OF MIXED MARSHAL ARTS WITH  THE HIGH-STAKES EXCITEMENT OF A  FOURTH GRADE BIRTHDAY PARTY. FOLKS, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT  COM-JUG VARIATIONS INCLUDING  ZOMBIE BOMB CAT AND SUMO COMBAT WHERE TWO JUGGLERS TRY TO FORCE  EACH OTHER OUT OF A CIRCLE AND  OF COURSE SOLO COMBAT WHERE YOU STAY HOME KISSING A PILLOW  BECAUSE THE GIRLS AT SCHOOL  FOUND OUT YOU DO COMBAT  JUGGLING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, I'M SWEPT UP IN COM-JUG. I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I WISH  OTHER STREET PERFORMANCES WOULD  ADD A COMBAT ELEMENT LIKE CARICATURE ARTIST THUNDER DOME. TWO MEN ENTER, ONE MAN LEAVES  WITH A GIANT HEAD HITTING A GOLF  BALL OFF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OR ULTIMATE BALLOON  ANIMAL WRESTLING WHERE YOU NOT  ONLY HAVE TO PIN YOUR OPPONENT BUT TIME HIM INTO A POODLE.
