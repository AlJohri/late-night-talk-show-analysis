(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, WE ALL NEED A LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT IN OUR LIVES AND IS THERE ANYTHING MORE COMFORTING THAN A STUFFED ANIMAL? AS A KID MY FAVORITE WAS A 12-POINT BUCK HEAD. (LAUGHTER) I TOOK HIM EVERYWHERE, NAMED HIM STABBY. SOME ADULTS STILL HAVE THEIR STUFFED ANIMALS AND NATION, I'VE GOT EXCITING NEWS FOR YOU.
IF YOU CAN'T GO ON VACATION, MAYBE YOUR PET CAN. YOUR PET STUFFED ANIMAL. YUP, A TRAVEL COMPANY IN TOKYO IS OFFERING VACATIONS FOR STUFFED TOYS THAT WILL COST YOU ANYWHERE BETWEEN $20 AND $55. WHY, YOU SAY? WELL, THE TRAVEL COMPANY SAYS PEOPLE LIVE VICARIOUSLY THROUGH THEIR STUFFED ANIMALS AND WHEN THEY SEE THEIR CUDDLY TOYS JETTING OFF TO SOMEWHERE FUN IT'S AS IF THEY'RE TRAVELING.
Stephen: YES, STUFFED ANIMAL VACATIONS BECAUSE NOTHING LIGHT'S UP A CHILD'S FACE BY SAYING "MR. PIGS IS GOING TO DISNEYWORLD! YOU STAY HOME." (LAUGHTER) AND THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE TO AMERICANS THROUGH THE UNAGI TRAVEL ANSWERS AND FRANCE'S FURRY TOY TOURS. SURE, SOME MIGHT ASK WHY, BUT OTHERS WILL ASK-- SERIOUSLY, WHY? (LAUGHTER) BUT I SAY WHY STOP AT JUST VACATION? IF YOU'RE AN ADULT SENDING YOUR STUFFED ANIMAL ON A DREAM TRIP, IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THE REST OF YOUR LIFE MAY ALSO NEED SERIOUS HELP. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE STEPHEN COLBEAR'S LIFETIME OF FUR-FILLMENT. FOR $100 SEND ME YOUR PLUSH TOY AND WATCH IT AS A SEES THE WORLD ON A TRIP YOU ALWAYS MEANT TO TAKE AND ATTEND TO LAW SCHOOL YOU DIDN'T GET INTO. MOVES INTO A DOWNTOWN LOFT INSTEAD OF YOUR PARENTS' GARAGE, MARRIES DENICE FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHO YOU NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO ASK OUT, CELEBRATE AS THE HAPPY COUPLE WELCOME THEIR FIRST BEANIE BABY. (LAUGHTER) AND THE RABBIT SURPRISES DENICE WITH A CRIB HE HAND CRAFTED OUT OF RECLAIMED CYPRUS FROM DENICE'S FAMILY FARM. EXPERIENCE THE JOY AS THE RABBIT BRAVELY CONFRONTS YOUR FATHER ABOUT HIS EMOTIONAL DETACHMENT. (LAUGHTER) TURNS OUT, HIS FATHER NEVER SHOWED HIM THE LOVE HE NEEDED. AND THEN WHEN DENICE GETS CANCER, THE RABBIT STAYS BY HER SAOEURBGSD HIS FLUSH PAW HOLDING HER HAND AS SHE LETS GO, KNOWING HE DID EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO LOVE HER. (AUDIENCE REACTS) IT WAS ALL WORTH IT, EVEN FORGIVING DENICE FOR THAT AFFAIR WITH BRAD. HE KNEW THE HARDEST PART WAS NOT DENICE'S INFIDELITY BUT HIS RELUCTANCE TO FORGIVE. BUT THIS STUFFED RABBIT SAW THE BIG PICTURE. HE LIVED AN HONEST LIFE AND FORMED REAL ATTACHMENTS WITH LIVING, BREATHING HUMANS WHO WILL NOT STUFFED (BLEEP)ING ANIMALS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT RABBIT IS TWICE THE MAN YOU'LL EVER BE! BY THE WAY, HE'S NOT COMING HOME. LAST TIME I SAW HIM HE WAS HEADED TO HAITI TO REBUILD A HOSPITAL. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
