NO, NO. I HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.
Colbert: I WENT IN --
GO AHEAD.
Colbert: THANKS SO MUCH. NOW, YOU ARE ON THE FORBES LIKE  CELEBRITY POWER LIST, NUMBER 20,  BECAUSE YOU ARE A WRITER, A  DIRECTOR, AN ACTOR, A PRODUCER, A PLAYWRIGHT. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND  YOUR THING YET. WHAT IS NEXT?  SPOT WELDING?   WHY SO MANY THINGS?
I AM JUST TRAINED MYSELF  EARLY ON, I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH  MONEY SO I LEARNED HOW TO DO ALL  THE JOBS MYSELF AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LET GOYETTE.
Colbert: REALLY?  BUT WHERE  DO YOU FIND THE TIME FOR THE  WRITER, DIRECTOR, PLAYWRIGHT AND  AUTHOR, RIGHT?
YES.
Colbert: PROBABLY MOST  FAMOUS FOR PLAYING MEDEA. THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THAT ROLE,  THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY GOOD  ROLES FOR OLD BLACK WOMEN. ELDERLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN  ACTRESSES HAVE IT TOO EASY. BY THE WAY, WHO EMPLOYS MORE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN ACTORS?  YOU OR  EVERYONE ELSE IN HOLLYWOOD?

Colbert: IS IT A COMEDY?   BECAUSE IT LOOKED GOOD. IT LOOKED SUPER ACTION Y.
THE REASON I ASK BECAUSE YOUR  MOVIES CAN GO ALL OVER THE  PLACE. YOU ARE WATCHING A MA DEA MOVIE  AND ONE LAST MOMENT YOU ARE  LAUGHING AND THE NEXT YOU ARE  DEALING WITH SERIOUS ISSUES AND THERE ARE HEARTRENDING HUMAN  DRAMA GOING AT THE SAME TIME. WHY DO YOU STICK THE GUN THING  IN A MOVIE?
I USE THE CHARACTERS AS ME  DEMA DEA TWO, TO MAKE PEOPLE  LAUGH AND TALK ABOUT SERIOUS  ISSUES I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE GIVEN THIS KIND OF  PLATFORM TO INSPIRE AND UPLIFT  THEM, THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO DO F  I TRY TO USE THE CHARACTERS TO MAKE THEM LAUGH, RELAX A LITTLE  BIT AND PUT THE MESSAGE IN  THERE.
Colbert: DID YOU SAY YOU  USED MA DEA AS ANESTHESIA?
YEAH, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT.
Colbert: YOU ARE PUTTING  AMERICA UNDER AND YOU ARE  OPERATING ON OUR SOULS.
THAT IS SO GREAT.
