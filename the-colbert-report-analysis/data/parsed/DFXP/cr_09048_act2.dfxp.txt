YEAH. DUSTY AND I HAD A GREAT TIME  MAKING HIS NEW MOVIE "QUINTET"  IN WHICH I PLAY THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF BUDDY, THE SPOONS PLAYER.
YEAH, ABOUT THE MOVIE, WE  NEED TO TALK.
YES! LET'S TALK SEQUEL. PICTURE THIS: "OCTET", STARRING  ALL THE ORIGINAL CAST, PLUS ME  IN FAT SUITS FOR THREE MORE  ROLES. IT WILL BE LIKE "THE KLUMPS"  MEETS "TWILIGHT."  FAT, AFRICAN AMERICAN VAMPIRES. [ LAUGHTER ]

Stephen: WHAT?
I'M REALLY SORRY, STEPHEN,  THIS IS HOW THE BUSINESS WORKS. I WAS COMPLETELY CUT OUT OF  "RAIN MAN."
Stephen: YOU WON AN OSCAR FOR  "RAIN MAN."
YES, FOR PLAYING RAYMOND. BUT ORIGINALLY, I WAS SUPPOSED  TO PLAY BOTH PARTS. THEY ADDED TOM CRUISE IN POST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: BUT DUSTIN-TIN, CAN  I CALL YOU TINTIN?
OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: TINNY, YOU CAN'T CUT  OUT THE FIFTH CHARACTER AND  STILL CALL IT "QUINTET."
YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE CHANGED THE NAME.
Stephen: TO WHAT?
"QUARTET."
Stephen: "QUARTET?"  THAT'S A STUPID NAME FOR A  MOVIE!
IT'S NOT A STUPID NAME. IT'S NOT A STUPID NAME  SPOONS IS A STUPID CHARACTER  CHOICE!
Stephen: YOU LEAVE SPOONS  OUT OF THIS. I KILLED IN THAT MOVIE. JIMMY, RUN THE CLIP.
ALL THAT GLORY.

REGGIE, DON'T I GET A KISS.
