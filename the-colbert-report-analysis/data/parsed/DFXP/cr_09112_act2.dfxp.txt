PLEASE WELCOME JOHN MELLENCAMP,  STEPHEN KING, AND T BONE  TURNETT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. STEVEEB, STEPHEN, T BONE,  WELCOME TO THE SHOW. ALL RIGHT, FELL AS, THIS IS AN  UNUSUAL MELARGE OF PEOPLE TO  HAVE IN ONE PLACE. I WAS EXPECT AGO YOUNG MAN IN  THE FRONT ROW, YES.
WHAT WAS THAT ONE WORD YOU  USED.
Stephen:  MELANGE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
Stephen:  IT'S LIKE A MIX.
LEMON MELANGE PIE.
Stephen:  EXACTLY. I WAS HOPING-- I WAS HOPING TO  GET K.J. ROWELLING AND BOB  SEEINGER AND PHIL SPECTOR. BUT YOU GUYS-- YOU GUYS ARE JUST  AS GOOD BECAUSE I'M HUGE FANS OF  ALL OF YOU. YOU'VE GOT A NEW PROJECT WHICH  IS FASCINATING. IT'S CALLED "GHOST BROTHERS OF  DARKLAND COUNTY."  AND WE'LL GET TO THIS IN JUST-- WHAT IT'S ABOUT IN JUST ONE  MOMENT. BUT WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? HOW DID THE THREE OF YOU-- I  MEAN, YOU MORE LIKELY I'M LESS  LIKELY TO SEE YOU TWO MIXED UP WITH THESE GUYS. HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN  WRITING A MUSICAL?
JOHN AND I HAD THE SAME  AGENT, AND JOHN WAS TALKING TO  THIS GUY AND THE GUY WANTED HIM TO DO LIKE A "MAMA MIA" KIND OF  THING, BE ON STAGE AND ALL SONGS  --
Stephen:  ALL MELLENCAMP. "IT'S ABOUT JACK AND DIANE, AND  THEY WERE LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN  CALLED R-O-C-K IN THE U.S.A. THE FOUGHT AUTHORITY BUT  AUTHORITY WON. AND THEN?
THE GUY AND I JUST WENT ON  AND WE WERE JUST TALKING AND I  TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS CAB I HAD JUST BOUGHT, AND I WAS SAYING I  COULDN'T BELIEVE I PAID FOR THIS  THING, AND WE FIXED IT ALL UP AND STAYED THERE ONE NIGHT AND  THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED.
Stephen:  YOU BOUGHT A  HAUNTED HOUSE.
YES, TWO BROTHERS AND A GIRL  IN 1935 WERE TALKING AND  DRINKING AND THEY GOT MAD AT EACH OTHER, THE TWO BOYS KNOT  MAD AT EACH OTHER, AND ONE HIT  THE OTHER ONE OVER THE HEAD WITH THE POKER IN FRONT OF THE  FIREPRICE. THE OTHER TWO TAKE OFF TO GET  HELP BECAUSE IT'S HIS BROTHER. THEY'RE DRIVING INTO TOWN--  REMEMBER HOW BIG THE CARS WERE  AND HOW GRAVELLY THE ROADS USED TO BE IN 1935 IT'S KIDS LOSE  CONTROL, SLIDE OFF INTO A LAKE. THEY TIE, SO THEY RECOVER ALL  THE KIDS AND THE--
GET TO THE POINT.
SO THEY FIND THE KIDS IN THE  CAR, WONDERING WHY WHEREHIS  BROTHER WAS, GO BACK TO THE FAMILY CABIN, AND THE BROTHER'S  LAYING THERE IN THE FRONT YARD  WITH HIS HEAD EATEN OFF. SOME ANIMAL ATE HIS HEAD OFF. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. THEY'RE DELICIOUS. ( LAUGHTER )  HEADS ARE DELICIOUS.
Stephen:  NOT EVERYBODY  LEFT IN THE FRONT YARD GETS  THEIR HEAD EATEN OFF.
IT GIVES NEW MEANING TO THE  TERM GETTING ( BLEEP ), DOESN'T  IT?
Stephen:  DON'T TOUCH ME.
HE'S BLUSHING.
Stephen:  A LITTLE BIT.
HE'S BLUSHING!
Stephen:  A LITTLE BIT. I CALLED HIM UP AND YOU SAID,  "I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN THAT  NOVEL."  I'VE GOT IT ALL DOWN. WHO ROPED YOU IN, T BONE.
JOHN CALLED. HE'S GOT ABOUT A TWO-HOUR  45-MINUTE VERSION OF THIS. IT'S BEEN ABOUT 10 YEARS NOW  THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT. AND THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT  WHERE THEY WANT TO GO WITH IT OR  WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH IF SO THEY SAID, "HERE, WHAT ABOUT IT  IT THIS?"
Stephen:  WHAT WAS IT, T  BONE? HOLD THERE. THAT'S A MYSTERY WE WILL SOLVE  IN JUST ONE MOMENT. WE'LL BE BACK FROM COMMERCIAL  WITH JOHN
