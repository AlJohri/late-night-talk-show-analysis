(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! NATION, I GOT TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT IS SO WONDERFUL TO HEAR THAT FROM THIS AUDIENCE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, HEROES! THANK YOU, NATION, THANK YOU! FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE CHECKING THE PAPERS AND LOOKING AT THE TVs THERE'S JUST SO MUCH SAD NEWS OUT THERE THESE DAYS THAT TONIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO KICK THINGS OFF WITH A HOT SHOT, A PICK ME UP FROM WHAT I LIKE TO CALL STEPHEN COLBERT'S SMILE FILE. TONIGHT ON THE SMILE FILE TYRANNICAL NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN. FOLKS, THIS MAD MAN LIVES A CONSTANT STATE OF STERN DISAPPROVAL. BUT EVEN BEFORE HE CAME TO POWER JONG UN MADE NO TIME FOR FRIVOLITY. JUST LISTEN TO THIS ACTUAL CNN INTERVIEW WITH HIS OLD BORDER SCHOOL ROOMMATE FROM SWITZERLAND.
DID YOU GO OUT IN THE NIGHT, YOU NEVER GO OUT, ON DISCO OR MAKE PARTY, NEVER.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, HE NOT EVEN AS A TEEN HE NEVER GO OUT ON DISCO OR MAKE PARTY. I BET HE NEVER EVEN GO OUT ON MOVIE OR MAKE BOWLING. SO SAD. BUT FOLKS, IT TURNS OUT THAT BENEATH THAT SAD EXPRESSION  KIM JUNG-UN JUST MIGHT BE KIM JUNG FUN. BECAUSE NORTH KOREAN STATE MEDIA, YOUR ALBINO SEA CUCUMBER NEWS LEADER, HAS RELEASED NEW PHOTOS OF THE DEAR LEADER TOURING AN INDUSTRIAL LUBRICANT FACTORY. I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THAT SMILE! I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM OR ANYONE, REALLY, SO TRANSPORTED BY THE PURE JOY OF LUBE. (LAUGHTER) NOTHING PUTS A GRIN ON THAT MACHINE'S FACE LIKE EXTRUDED SEMI SOLIDS. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE GUY NEXT TO HIM IS SUCH A SOUR PUS. I MEAN HE GETS TO SPEND 16 HOURS A DAY WATCHING THAT LUBE. (LAUGHTER) IT SURE IS NICE TO SEE UN FINALLY LET HIS HAIR DOWN. HE'S USUALLY SO SERIOUS WHEN HE'S LOOKING AT THINGS. THINGS LIKE FRUIT. MATTRESSES. ACCORDIONS, CHUROS, WATER SLIDES, REGULAR SLIDES, FLOORING OPTIONS AND WHERE THEY THREW HIS UNCLE'S BODY. (APPLAUSE) BUT NONE-- NONE OF THOSE-- NONE OF THOSE HAS BROUGHT HIM THE SIMPLE LIFE AFFIRMING PLEASURE OF LUBE. AND I GET IT, I ALSO ENJOY WATCHING NONDESCRIPT VISCOUS GOO BEING FORCE THREW A TUBE. I COULD SPEND HOURS AT THE SOFT SERVE PUMP. AND UN'S NOT JUST SMILING FROM CHIN TO CHIN OVER A SINGLE LUBE EJECTER, HE'S SMILING ALL THROUGH THE LUBRICANT FACTORY FROM THE LUBE LOADING FLOOR TO THE STATE OF THE ART LUBE COMMAND DECK WHERE THE LATEST NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCED SUPERCOMPUTERS ARE HARNESSED TO INSURANCE THAT LUBE GO THROUGH TUBE. AND THIS FACTORY IS A HAPPY PLACE FOR KIM JUNG-UN FOR A VERY PERSONAL REASON. IT REPRESENTS THE COMPLETION OF HIS FATHER'S KIM JUNG IL'S VISION. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO STATE REPORTS UN SAID WITH DEEP EMOTION I FEEL VERY SORRY FOR FAILING IT TO SHOW HIM THIS MODERN SPEND DID FACTORY EVEN ONCE. THIS FACTORY IS A POSTHUMOUS ONE. I MEAN, THAT GETS YOU RIGHT IN THE LUBE PUMP. HE AND HIS FATHER SHARED A LOVE OF SLAVE-MADE LUBE. DON'T WE ALL. AND THAT'S THE SMILE FILE. (APPLAUSE) EVERYBODY HAPPY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, KIM JUNG-UN. NATION, 2016 IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, ANOTHER LEAP YEAR. THAT'S A WHOLE EXTRA DAY TO STOCK UP ON CANNED GOODS AND KEROSENE. BUT 2016 WILL ALSO BRING THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTON AND I'M A SUCKER FOR POLITICAL DYNASTIES, MY CURRENT FAVORITE ONE IS THE LIBERTARIAN PAUL FAMILY. THERE'S PAPA RON, SON RAND AND OF COURSE COUSIN RU. (LAUGHTER) WHO HAS A STRONG-- WHO HAS A STRONG CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE. (LAUGHTER)
YOU BETTER WORK. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU, A CLEAR CALL TO END THE WELFARE STATE. NOW WE ALL KNOW THE RAND MAN HAS HIS EYE ON THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016, WHICH IS WHY SENATOR PAUL IS   APPEALING TO MINORITY GROUPS USING A RADICAL STRATEGY OF BEING APPEALING.
SO WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID IS PEOPLE WHO SEEK THE AMERICAN DREAM ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE. SOME PEOPLE PERCEIVE IT THAT WAY AND THAT'S A PERCEPTION WE DO HAVE TO CHANGE.
I'M FOR A VERY EXPANSIVE WORK VISA. IF YOU WANT TO COME TO OUR COUNTRY OR ONE OF 191 MILLION THAT ARE HERE, I'M FOR GIVING YOU A WORK VISA.
THE DOOR'S TO THE GOING TO OPEN UP TO THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY OR HISPANIC COMMUNITY UNTIL WE HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. REPUBLICANS HAVE TO OFFER HISPANICS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS SOMETHING. FOR INSTANCE, ANYTHING. (LAUGHTER) BUT TO WIN THE NOMINATION PAUL STILL NEEDS CONSERVATIVE VOTERS. AND THEIR SOLUTIONS TO IMMIGRATION RANGE FROM DEPORTATION TO GLUE TRAPS. SO TO BALANCE HIS PRO MINORITY TALK PAUL HAS BEEN APPEARING WITH CONSERVATIVE IOWA CONGRESSMAN AND MAN WITH A SECTION OF HIS BASEMENT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED INTO, STEVE KING. NOW-- DON'T GO THERE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DON'T DO IT, DON'T DO IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO. UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR CAMPAIGN STOPS HAVEN'T ALL BEEN FORCED DEAD-EYE SMILES. EARLIER THIS WEEK THEY SAT DOWN FOR A NICE JUICY BURGER ONLY TO BE AMBUSHED BY PRO IMMIGRATION ACTIVISTS. WATCH HOW SWIFTLY SENATOR PAUL REACTS.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT CROWD SO-- I'M GLAD --
I AM ACTUALLY A DREAMER-- AND ORIGINALLY FROM MEXICO. BUT I BEEN RAISED HERE. I GRADUATED FROM ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET RID OF DACA.
AND JUST LIKE THAT, HE'S GONE. AND YES, AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE WORD MEXICAN SENATOR PAUL SPED OFF LIKE A CENTRAL AMERICAN DEATH TRAIN BUT HE CLEARLY CARES ABOUT THE HISPANIC OUTREACH, AFTER ALL HE WANT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DRESS LIKE A PINATA. (LAUGHTER) NATURALLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NATURALLY THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA IS ACCUSING RAND OF SIDESTEPPING A POTENTIALLY DAMAGING POLITICAL CONFRONTATION BUT THAT IS WRONG. HE WAS NOT SIDESTEPPING, HE WAS AWAY-RUNNING. AND HE DID IT FOR A VERY GOOD REASON. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE TO STAY IN SHAPE. AND I AM THRILLED THAT TONIGHT SENATOR PAUL IS MAKING AVAILABLE TO YOU HIS ONE WEIRD SECRET TO REDUCING YOUR BELLY FAT, JIM?  HI I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. ARE YOU FED UP WITH BEING FAT, SICK AND TIRED OF BEING BEEFY. DISCONTENTED WITH YOUR CORPULENCE. THEN I'VE GOT AN ANSWER FOR YOU. THE RAND PAULEO DIET. YES, THE RAND PAULEO DIET, THE ONLY WEIGHT LOSS SYSTEM SCIENTIFICALLY DEVELOPED BY A SELF-LICENSED  OPTHALMOLOGIST IT'S JUST THREE EASY STEPS TO DEREGULATING YOUR WAISTLINE. STEP ONE, WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. STEP TWO, EAT ANYTHING YOU WANT. BURGERS, PIZZA, EVEN ICE CREAM. STEP 3, WE SEND A MEXICAN TO SHOW UP TO YOUR MEAL. I PROMISE NO MATTER HOW GOOD THAT FOOD LOOKS, YOU WILL BURST INTO A HEART-HEALTHY RUN. I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THE RESULTS. HERE'S RAND PAUL BEFORE, AND HERE HE IS AFTER. THE POUNDS-- THE POUNDS HAVE JUST MELTED AWAY. AND UNLIKE THOSE OTHER WEIGHT LOSS PLANS, THE RAND PAULEO DIET, YOU WON'T HAVE TO SUFFER WITH THOSE BAD TASTING PREPACKAGED FOODS. YOU EAT WHAT YOU WANT UNTIL WE SEND YOU AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT RIGHT TO YOUR HOME. IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE CHEAPER TO SHIP THAN FOOD. AND YOU CAN STILL EAT AT YOUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT BECAUSE IT'S A DAMN GOOD CHANCE A WEIGHT LOSS MEXICAN ALREADY WORKS THERE. SO ORDER THE RAND PAULEO DIET TODAY AND YOU COULD TAKE OFF POUNDS WITHOUT TAKING ON THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
