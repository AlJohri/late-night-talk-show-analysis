[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. [CROWD CHEERING]  [CHANTING STEPHEN, STEPHEN] [CROWD CHEERING]  [CHANTING STEPHEN, STEPHEN]
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. YOU FOLKS, YOU FOLKS AT HOME CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ABOUT THE THINGS WE'VE ALL BEEN THROUGH TONIGHT ALREADY. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS A STRESSFUL JOB, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU. SO WHEN I'M NOT OUT HERE SPITTING THE TRUTH HOT AND HARD,   I RELAX BY GAMING. I'M A HUGE GAMER, I PLAY THEM ALL, MONOPOLY, GO FISH. SAYING I'LL MEET YOU THERE BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT I HAVE A THING AND I DON'T SHOW UP. I WIN. I ALSO LOVE GAMES OF THE VIDEO NATURE. I'VE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS PLAYING DARK SOULS, ASSASSIN'S CREED, CALL OF DUTY. WHICH IS WHEN I PAUSE ASSASSIN'S CREED AND GO USE THE BATHROOM. [APPLAUSE] HIGH SCORE. NEW HIGH SCORE LAST NIGHT.  [LAUGHTER] AS A GAMESMAN, I AM GRIPPED BY A SCANDAL CALLED GAMERGATE THAT'S SHAKEN THE VIDEO WORLD. YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF THE TERM GAMERGATE. I HAVE. THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT UP JUST NOW. [LAUGHTER]
WHAT IS IT ABOUT. IT IS A SCANDAL ABOUT GAMING AND SEXISM THAT'S NOW MADE  FRONT PAGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ONE MILLION TWEETS AND COUNTING TO THE GAMERGATE HASHTAG. IT'S AN ONLINE BATTLE OF THE SEXES OVER HOW GAMERS ARE PORTRAYED  IN THE SOMETIMES VIOLENT REACTION TO WOMEN WHO SPEAK OUT.
Stephen:  YES, GAMERGATE NAMED AFTER WATERGATE WHEN A  COVERT GROUP KNOWN AS THE PLUMBERS WERE CAUGHT  SPYING FOR THE WHITEHOUSE. AT LEAST IN GAMERGATE WE KNOW WHO THE PLUMBERS ARE. [LAUGHTER] AS THE TV MAN SAID, GAMERGATE INVOLVES SOME MALE GAMERS HARASSING WOMEN WHO ARE  SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE PORTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN VIDEO GAMES  PRESUMING AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK  THAT WOMEN WERE EVEN SPEAKING TO THEM AT ALL. [CROWD CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] LEADING THE CHARGE IS MEDIA CRITIC AND WORLD OF WAR CRAFT TRIBUTE NAMED  ANITA SARKEESIAN, WHO THINKS THE CURRENT GENDER ROLES IN VIDEO GAMES MEGA-BITE. JIM?
FEMINIST CRITIC ANITA SARKEESIAN HAS CONDEMNED  STEREOTYPES AND ABUSE OF WOMEN IN VIDEO GAMES SUCH AS DRAGON  AGE ORIGINS.
LET GO OF ME!
IT'S A PARTY, ISN'T IT? GRAB A WHORE AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
WOMEN ARE OFTEN A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS, OR HELPLESS IN SOME WAY OR HIGHLY SEXUALIZED AND SORT OF CREATED TO BE THESE MALE FANTASIES.
Stephen: YES, VIDEO GAMES ARE LOADED WITH MALE FANTASY STEREOTYPES LIKE ALL THE GIRLS IN DEAD OR ALIVE,  TIFA LOCKHART FROM FINAL FANTASY 7 AND MS. PACMAN. SHE CAN  GOBBLE MY GHOST ANY TIME. [LAUGHTER] GAMERGATERS SAY THAT THE SCANDAL IS REALLY ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED ETHICS AND VIDEO GAME JOURNALISM AND CLAIM COLLUSION BETWEEN CRITICS LIKE SARKEESIAN, FEMALE DEVELOPERS AND THE MEDIA TO FAVOR SOFTER MORE FEMALE FRIENDLY GAME WHERE IN THIS ONE GAME YOU PLAY A GUST OF WIND. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT GUST OF WIND? BLOW ME. [LAUGHTER] NOW ACCORDING TO NEWS WEEK, THE ORIGINAL CLAIM THAT STARTED ALL THIS, COLLUSION BETWEEN ONE DEVELOPER AND ONE REVIEWER WASN'T TRUE. BUT THE FIRE WAS LIT AND THE FLAME WARS BEGAN.
IT IS A GROUP OF MALE GAMERS WHO ARE ATTACKING WOMEN.
THREATS OF DEATH AND OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE.
BOMB, RAPE AND DEATH THREATS FROM ON-LINE HARASSERS
GAME DEVELOPER BRIANNA WU WENT INTO HIDING OVER THE  WEEKEND AFTER RECEIVING DEATH THREATS LIKE THESE. YOU JUST MADE A  BLANK GAME NOBODY LIKES. THAT'S IT NOBODY WILL CARE WHEN YOU DIE.
Stephen:  AS OPPOSED TO ON-LINE TROLLS, THEIR DEATHS  LEAD TO WIDESPREAD CELEBRATION. BUT GAMERGATERS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN HARASSED TOO,  ESPECIALLY ONCE THE MEDIA SAW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING TO THESE WOMEN. GAMERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT ANTI-GAMER, ANTI-NERD BULLYING FOR FOLLOWING THEIR TRADITIONAL GAMER LIFE-STYLE. YES, THERE'S A TRADITIONAL GAMER LIFE-STYLE. GOD ORDAINED IT IS ONE MAN, ONE JOY STICK. READ YOUR BIBLE. [APPLAUSE] READ YOUR BIBLE, FOLKS. [APPLAUSE] IT'S RIGHT THERE IN SEGA GENESIS . WELL NO MATTER, NO MATTER WHAT ALL THESE FEMINIST CRITICS SAY, I'M NOT ASHAMED OF MY HOBBY THAT'S WHY I DO IT ALONE IN MY BASEMENT. BECAUSE NEWS FLASH WHAT I DO IN A VIDEO GAME DOESN'T REFLECT THE WAY I ACT IN THE REAL WORLD. I LOVE MARIO KART BUT I DON'T GO AROUND THROWING BANANA PEELS OUT OF MY CAR. BECAUSE TURTLE SHELLS ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. SO I SPEAK FOR ALL GAMERS WHEN I SAY THE MEDIA SHOULD STOP TALKING TO CRITICS LIKE ANITA SARKEESIAN. HERE NOW TO BE TALKED TO IS MEDIA CRITIC AND CREATOR OF THE WEB SERIES FEMINIST FREQUENCY, ANITA SARKEESIAN [APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT, LOOK. LET'S PUT THIS ON THE LINE, OKAY. LET'S CALL THIS WHAT IT IS. YOU AND THE OTHER FEMI-NAZIS IN THE GAMER WORLD ARE COMING FOR A BALLS TO CUT EM OFF AND PUT THEM INTO A LITTLE FELT  PURSE AND TAKE THEM AWAY SO WE HAVE TO PLAY YOUR NON-VIOLENT GAMES, RIGHT.
NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S A CULTURE WAR. IT'S A SUBCULTURE WAR.
THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON, AND WHAT IT IS IS WOMEN BEING HARASSED AND THREATENED AND TERRORIZED.
AFTER YOU FIRST ATTACKED GAMERS AFTER ENJOYING LOOKING  AT BIG BREASTED WOMEN WITH TINY ARMOR THAT BARELY COVERS THEIR NIPPLES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? I LIKE WHAT THAT  LOOKS LIKE. I'M A MAN BABY, NEWS FLASH, I LIKE IT.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IT ACTUALLY REINFORCES THE CULTURE MYTH THAT WOMEN ARE SEXUAL OBJECTS AND SEXUAL PLAY THINGS FOR MALE AMUSEMENT AND WE'RE NOT.
Stephen:  WE'RE SAVING THEM. THEY'RE DAMSELS IN DISTRESS. I'M SAVING THE PRINCESS. AM I SUPPOSED TO LET THE PRINCESS DIE? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT. THAT'S KINDA HARSH, THAT'S KINDA HOSTILE.
MAYBE THE PRINCESS COULDN'T BE A DAMSEL AND SHE COULD SAVE HERSELF. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  THEY'VE GOT GAMES. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU BROUGHT A POSSE.
I'M WELL LIKED.
Stephen:  SO YOU'VE BEEN THE OBJECT OF CRITICISM YOURSELF.
YES.
Stephen:  WHAT HAPPENED AT UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY.
THERE WAS A THREAT THAT SOMEONE E-MAILED TO THE SCHOOL SAYING THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT THE BIGGEST SCHOOL SHOOTING, A MASSACRE IF I WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK.
Stephen:  BY CRITICIZING THESE, YOU SAY WOULD YOU CALL THEM MALE FANTASY GAMES OR MALE FANTASY OBJECTIFICATION OF WOMEN GAMES.
SOME OF THEM.
Stephen:  GIVE ME SOME NAMES. NAME SOME NAMES.
SO IN THE WORK THAT I DO, I LOOK AT HUNDREDS OF EXAMPLES OF VIDEO GAMES.
Stephen:  CAN YOU THINK OF 3?
I CAN BUT IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE TO TALK ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND HOW IT PERPETUATES THESE IDEAS OF SEXISM AND MISOGYNY AS OPPOSED TO GRAND THEFT AUTO FOR EXAMPLE.
Stephen:  WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN ARE BEING THREATENED. IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY WOMEN WHO ARE BEING THREATENED IN GAMER GATES.
YES.
Stephen:  CHRIS KLUWE HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS, OTHER MEN HAVEN'T BEEN THREATENED. WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN ARE BEING THREATENED IN THIS EXCHANGE.
I THINK WOMEN ARE PERCEIVED AS THREATENING BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING FOR GAMES TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE. WE'RE ASKING FOR GAMES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE EXIST AND WE LOVE GAMES.
Stephen:  WHY NOT HAVE A SEPARATE GAME. HAVE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL GAMES. [LAUGHTER]
WELL WE DO HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF GAMES.
Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT.
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS WE HAVE THIS WIDE RANGE OF GAME THAT WE'RE SEEING MOBILE GAMES, WE'RE SEEING INDY GAMES, WE'RE SEEING THIS INFLUX OF DIFFERENT KIND OF GAMES AND THAT'S WHAT GAMERGATE IS RESPONDING TO. THEY'RE ACTUALLY RESPONDING TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE SAYING GAMING CAN NO LONGER BE THIS LITTLE BOY'S CLUB ANYMORE. MANY OF US WOMEN HAVE BEEN PLAYING GAMES OUR WHOLE LIVES. SO THEY'RE LASHING OUT BECAUSE WE'RE CHALLENGING THE STATUS QUO OF GAMING AS A MALE DOMINATED SPACE. [APPLAUSE]
Stephen:  YOU SEE. YOU HEAR THE APPLAUSE FOR THE IDEA OF A MALE DOMINATED SPACE. WHAT ABOUT THE ACCUSATIONS OF COLLUSION BETWEEN DESIGNERS, FEMINISTS AND JOURNALISTS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ETHICS IN GAMER JOURNALISM. DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW HUGE THAT IS. WHAT IF THERE WAS NO ETHICS IN HOLLYWOOD JOURNALISM. [LAUGHTER] IF WE CAN'T TRUST ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT OR TMZ, WHERE WOULD WE BE. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT FOR GAMER JOURNALISM.
I THINK THAT IS A SORT OF COMPELLING WAY TO REFRAME THE FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ATTACK ON WOMEN. ETHICS AND JOURNALISM IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ANY WAY. IT'S ACTUALLY MEN GOING AFTER WOMEN IN REALLY HOSTILE AGGRESSIVE WAYS. THAT'S WHAT GAMERGATE IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT TERRORIZING  WOMEN FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THIS INDUSTRY, THIS HOBBY.
Stephen:  OFF SUBJECT, BUT AS A MAN, AM I ALLOWED TO BE A FEMINIST.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS TO  MEN AND WE SHOULD FIGHT FOR THOSE RIGHTS.
Stephen:  SURE.
GREAT, THEN YOU'RE A FEMINIST. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen:  ANITA SARKEESIAN, FEMINIST FREQUENCY.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
