ENORMOUS AND TALL, TOO. I THINK I'M MORE OF AN ENORMOUS  FAN THAN YOU.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU TOP  OUT AT?
SEVEN FOUR.
Stephen: NOT IN THE NAVI  COSTUME.
I'M FIVE 11.
Stephen: ME, TOO, WE SHOULD  DANCE SOMETIME.
I'D ENJOY THAT.
Stephen: TONY ACADEMY  AWARDS NOMINATED, GOLDEN GLOBE  WINNER. PEOPLE KNOW FROM YOUR HUGE  MOVIES ALIEN, AVATAR, YOUR  GHOSTBUSTERS.
NOW A PLAYBILL.
Stephen: A CRITICALLY  LAUDED. I HAVE A AT THAT TIMED PLAY BILL  BECAUSE WE WENT TO SEE IT  FANTASTIC PLAY CALLED "VANYA AND SONIA AND MASHA AND  SPIKE"  WHICH I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WERE  THE NINJA TURTLES. TURNS OUT NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO  THEATER? YOU ARE A MOVIE STAR, AREN'T YOU  SLUMMING HERE? [LAUGHTER]
I PLAY A VERY GLAMOROUS MOVIE  STAR IN THE PLAY.
Stephen: WAS THAT A  STRETCH?
IT WAS A BIG STRETCH TO PLAY  SUCH A DEEPLY SHALLOW PERSON AS  MASHA IS.
Stephen: YOU ARE NOT IN THE  TABLOID RAGS.
I'M IN FLASHER MOVE --  SLASHERS MOVIES I'M IN SCIENCE  FICTION.
Stephen: A HUGE DIFFERENCE  BECAUSE IN YOUR MOVIES THE BLOOD  SPURTS OUT OF UNEXPECTED PARTS OF BODY.
YES NOT ALL ORIFICES.
Stephen: WHO COULD TAKE WHO  IN A FIGHT AN ALIEN OR NAVI?
INTERESTING SPINOFF.
Stephen: I HAVE A SCRIPT  RIGHT HERE. IS IT TOUGH BEING IF A PLAY  AFTER DOING MOVIES? DON'T YOU WANT TO DO A ONE AND A  HALF MINUTE SCENE AND WAIT IN  YOUR TRAILER FOR SIX HOURS UNTIL THE NEXT SCENE?
YES, AND JUST EAST  CHOCOLATES?
Stephen: FOR THE WHOLE  TIME?
YES, BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT  SO MANY YEARS AND THEN YOU HAVE  TO MAKE AN HONEST LIVING. I'M WORKING WITH THE WOSTLED  DAVID HYDE PIERCE.
Stephen: AND YOUR OLD  FRIEND CHRISTOPHER DURANGE WHO  WROTE THIS?
HOW WOULD ONE RESIST THE LURE  OF BROADWAY?
Stephen: I WAS SLIGHTLY  DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WEREN'T  DANCING CANDLESTICKS IN THIS ONE AND I I WAS WORRIED I WOULDN'T  GET IT BECAUSE AIR SMART  ACTRESS?
AM I?
Stephen: YEAH, YOU RADIATE  INTELLIGENCE?
DO I?
Stephen: I FIND THAT  INTIMIDATING.
I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR THAT.
Stephen: THAT AND THE  HEIGHT. I FOOLED YOU THEN.
Stephen: YOU ARE NOT ONLY A  SUPERSTAR --
THAT'S FINE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: A RENOWNED ACTRESS  IS YOU ARE FROM A HOLLYWOOD  FAMILY, YOUR DAD, PAT WEAVER STARTED THE TONIGHT SHOW, RIGHT?
YES, DID HE.
Stephen: DID YOU KNOW THOSE  GUYS STEVE ALLEN OR JACK PARR,  DID YOU MEET THEM AS A KID?
I DID. I HAVE HOME MOVIES OF MYSELF  WITH -- NOT STEVE ALLEN BUT ART  LINKLETTER. I DID MEET THEM. THEY WERE AROUND. I THINK DID HE -- YOU KNOW, HE  LOVED TO COME IN AND DO LIVE  TELEVISION AND SO, I THINK IT WAS A GREAT -- A GREAT LIFE  MEETING ALL THOSE PEOPLE AND  WORKING WITH THEM SO CLOSELY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK  JOHNNY WOULD HAVE LIKED ME?
ABSOLUTELY. [ LAUGHTER ]

WITHOUT QUESTION.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE OF YOU  TO SAY.
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS  SHOW.
Stephen: REALLY?
HE WOULD HAVE RESPECTED YOUR  VIEWS AS A PUNDIT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SPEAKING OF  RESPECTING, YOU ALSO ARE -- YOU  HAVE BEEN PLAYING A FEMALE SECRETARY OF STATE ON SPLIT CAN  ANIMALS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU DABBLED  PLAYING SOMEONE IN POLITICS  EARLIER THIS YEAR.
IT CURED ME STEENCHT REAL
IT DIDN'T MAKE YOU WANT TO GOOD  INTO POLITICS AT ALL?
IT WAS VERY EXCITING TO PLAY  SOMEONE IN WASHINGTON WHO  ACTUALLY GETS THINGS DONE. [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS FUN. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY NEED  MORE FEMALE ENERGY IN  WASHINGTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SPEAKING FROM THEIR HEARTS  WITH STRONG MORAL COME PASSES  AND CHANGES THINGS AND FINDING SOLUTIONS INSTEAD OF GOING TO  IDEOLOGICALLENLEN OR CORNERS.
Stephen: ARE YOU A  POLITICAL PERSON. ARE YOU ONE OF THE HOLLYWOOD  ELITES WITH SIGNS SAY NOTHING  NUKES, BRING DOWN SADDAM. HAVE YOU MARCHED IN THE STREETS  AND BURNED YOUR BRA AND ALL THAT  STUFF?
UM, I HAVE MARCHED IN THE  STREETS STEENCHT YOU HAVE.
AS I'M SURE YOU HAVE.
Stephen: I HIRE PEOPLE TO  MARCH IN THE STREETS FOR ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
