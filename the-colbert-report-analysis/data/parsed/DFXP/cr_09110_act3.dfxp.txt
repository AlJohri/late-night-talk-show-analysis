YOUR NEW FILM CALLED WE  STEAL SECRETS THE STORY OF  WIKI LAEKS IN THEATRES NOW,  ON DEMAND JUNE 7th. WE STEAL SECRETS, ABOUT  WIKILEAKS, ARE YOU IN THIS  DISCUSSION TONIGHT GOING TO  SPILL ANY STATE SECRETS THAT COULD GET A BAG POPPED OVER  MY HEAD AND GET ME DRAGGED  OFF TO GUANTANAMO.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK  SO.
I DON'T THINK SO BUT YOU  KNOW, WE STEAL SECRETS IS  ACTUALLY A PHRASE SAID BY FORMER CIA DIRECTOR MICHAEL  HAYDEN. HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID  ALEX, WE STEAL SECRETS,  THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
Stephen: THE CIA DOES.
CORRECT.
Stephen: THEY'RE LICENCE  FOOD DO SO.
SEEMINGLY SO.
Stephen: ARE YOU MAKING  EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN THE CIA,  THE OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES,  AND SOME CLOWN LIKE JULIAN A  SANG AND BADLY MANNING, A KNOWN CRIMINAL WHO STOLE  THESE STATE SECRETS AND  LEAKED THEM TO THE WORLD AND  POSSIBLY TO OUR ENEMIES AND ENDANGERED AMERICAN LIVES.
BRADLEY MANNING IS TO YOU  BEING CHARGED WITH AIDING  THE ENEMY WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO TREASON. HE PLED GUILTY TO LEAK THE  SECRETS. AND THE SECRETS HE LEAKED  DID A LOT OF GOOD.
Stephen: EXPLAIN TO  PEOPLE BEFORE WE GET AHEAD  OF OURSELVE WAS BRADLEY MANNING IS AND WHAT HE DID,  FOR JULY YAN ASSANGE.
BRADLEY MANNING WAS AN  ARMY PRIVATE. HE WAS IN IRAQ, DEPLOYED IN  IRAQ. AND AT SOME POINT IN 2010 HE  LEAKED A VIDEO ABOUT THE  APACHE GUNSHIP WHICH KILLED A REUTERS JOURNALIST AND  ALSO SOME WAR LOGS FROM IRAQ  AND AFGHANISTAN AND ABOUT 250,000 STATE DEPARTMENT  CABLES.
Stephen: OKAY.
THESE WERE LEAKED TO  WIKILEAKS THEN WIKILEAKS  PARTNERED WITH "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND THE GUARDIAN AND  A GERMAN SMAING TO PUBLISH  THESE ALL OVER THE WORLD.
Stephen: ARE YOU ARGUING  THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE ON  TRIAL FOR WHAT HE DID?
HE PLED GUILTY TO LEAKING  THESE SECRETS. IT IS WHAT I WOULD CALL AN  ACT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. HE MAY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT  NAIVE ABOUT THE EXTENT TO  WHICH THESE SECRETS WOULD BE LEAKED ALL OVER THE WORLD. BUT I DO THINK THAT HE HAD A  SENSE THAT SOME VERY BAD  STUFF WAS GOING ON IN IRAQ AN AFGHANISTAN AND THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC NEEDED TO  KNOW ABOUT. AND HE FELT THAT SOMEBODY  SHOULD PUBLISH THEM.
Stephen: SO HE THOUGHT HE  WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.
INDEED.
Stephen: EVEN THOUGH IT  MIGHT BE AGAINST THE LAW FOR  HIM TO DO IT, HE HAD TO DO THAT THING BECAUSE IT WAS  THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: AND HE SHOULD  PAY A PRICE FOR THAT.
INDEED. HE SAID-- HE IS GOING TO PAY  A PRICE FOR IT.
Stephen: IF YOU THINK IT  IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT  AGAINST THE LAW YOU COULD STILL DO IT AND THEN JUST  PAY THE PRICE AFTERWARDS AND  SAY THAT IS THE PRICE I GIVE FOR MY COUNTRY THE SAME WAY  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION KNEW  IT WAS THE RANGE THIS TO DO TO TORTURE PEOPLE AND NOW  THEY HAVE ALL GONE TO JAIL.
NO.
Stephen: NO, I THINK  BIN-- A FAIR AMOUNT.
I'M PRETTY SURE NOBODY  WENT TO JAIL ABOUT IT.
Stephen: MAYBE DO A  DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THAT ONE.
A GOOD THOUGHT.
Stephen: NOW WHAT ABOUT  JULIAN ASSANGE HERE, THE  GHOST, AND I DON'T MEAN JUST THE PAILNESS OF HIS SKIN.
HARD TO FIND THE GUY,  HARD TO GET TO. DID YOU INTERVIEW HIM FOR  THIS DOCUMENTARY?
NO, I DIDN'T. HE REFUSED TO BE  INTERVIEWED. HE WANTED MONEY. AND THEN AFTER I SAID I  WOULDN'T PAY HIM, HE SAID  WELL HOW ABOUT YOU SPY ON  SOME OF THE OTHER INTERVIEW  SUBJECTS. AND I SAID WELL I'M NOT  GOING TO DO THAT.
Stephen: WAIT, WAIT, HE  WANTED YOU TO SPY ON, WHO  DID HE WANT TO YOU SPY ON.
ALL THE OTHER INTERVIEW  SUBJECTS I WAS TALKING TO  AND REPORT BACK TO HIM.
Stephen: SO YOU WOULD BE  WORKING FOR HIM.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WAS HE WILLING  TO PAY YOU TO WORK FOR HIM?
THAT WAS A GOOD QUESTION,  I SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIM  THAT.
Stephen: NOW I HAD HIM ON  MY SHOW IN 2010 AND IT WAS  FREE. (LAUGHTER)  HE ATE LIKE HALF A CHEESE  TRAY, YOU KNOW. IT WAS NICE. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ASKED  HIM HAD YOU THE CHANCE?
I WANTED TO HAVE HIM WALK  THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT HE  HAD DONE, THE PROCESS BY WHICH HE DECIDED TO COME UP  WITH THIS FRANKLY A VERY  GOOD IDEA WHICH IS THIS  TRANSNATIONAL PUBLISHING MECHANISM WHEREBY PEOPLE  COULD LEAK SECRET AS  NONMUSSLY TO A WEB SITE THAT  WOULD NOT BE BEHOLDEN TO POLITICAL PRESSURES AROUND  THE WORLD. I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW HE  CAME UP WITH THE IDEA AND  HOW HE PUT IT UP TO EFFECT.
Stephen: YOU SAY THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS  TENANTMENT TO CRIMINALIZE OG INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM. WHAT DOW MEAN BY THAT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS  HAPPENING IS THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW PROSECUTED MORE  WHISTLE-BLOWERS THAN ALL  PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS  COMBINED.
Stephen: AND THAT'S GOOD  OR BAD.
NASS'S BAD.
Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK  SPIES, ES MEANAGE, RIGHT  THERE IN THE NAME, YOU SHOULDN'T BE PROSECUTING  SPIES THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE  SAYING.
I AM SAYING THEY  SHOULDN'T BE PROSECUTING  WHISTLE-BLOWERS AS SPIES.
Stephen: WHO GETS TO SAY  WHAT IS A WHISTLE-BLOWER AND  WHAT IS A SPY,.
WELL, I GUESS THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES GETS TO SAY.
Stephen: DAMN STRAIGHT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED A  REPUBLICAN IN THERE.
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING ME. ALEC, WE STEAL SECRETS,  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
