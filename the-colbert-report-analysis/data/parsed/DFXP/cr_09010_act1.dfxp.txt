STEPHEN: HELLO! [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN'S NAME] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I GOTTA SAY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. FOLKS, I GOTTA SAY YOU MAY KNOW  THIS ALREADY BUT PEOPLE ASK ME  ALL THE TIME AND YOU CHANTING MY  NAME, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, I THINK IS MY FAVORITE KARAOKE SONG. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ROMNEY RYAN TICKET IS FIRING  ON ALL CYLINDERS WHICH SAY HUGE  IMPROVEMENT FOR MITT WHO WAS  PREVIOUSLY JUST FIRING PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW HE'S GOT THE EDGE HEADING  INTO TONIGHT'S ALL IMPORTANT  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. INTO THAT UNLIKE OBAMA HE WAS  THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE TAPING THIS SHOW, MY SHOW  RIGHT NOW AHEAD OF TIME SO I  DON'T KNOW WHO WON BUT I'M  GUESSING MITT. BECAUSE THE VENUE WAS IN NASSAU  COUNTY, NEW YORK, JUST AN  AVERAGE TOWN OF AVERAGE  AMERICANS EARNING AN AVERAGE INCOME OF $91,000 ALMOST TWICE  THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. MITT CAN REALLY RELATE TO PEOPLE  MAKING.91,000 A YEAR. HE DOES THAT EVERY DAY. NO ONE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS. I'M GOING TO WATCH IT ON CNN  LATER. WE'VE GOT THIS GREAT NEW WAY TO  FOCUS ON WHAT THE CANDIDATES ARE  SAYING.
CNN.COM HAS VERY COOL  TECHNOLOGY, BY THE WAY THAT LETS  YOU SHARE YOUR FAVORITE MOMENTS. ALEX EXPLAINED IT TO BROOK  BALDWIN.
IF I HIT CLIP AND SHARE OFF  THE HOMEPAGE IT GRABS THE MOMENT  THAT JUST HAPPENED. LOOK, THIS IS THE MOMENT IN THE  MOMENT INSIDE THE MOMENT, RIGHT.
ALEX, GET OUT OF HERE.
ISN'T IT HOT. I HIT SHARE ON FACEBOOK.
BECAUSE WHAT I LOVE ABOUT  WATCHING THE DEBATES NOW IS I'M  TEXTING, TWEETING. AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING DID YOU  SEE THAT MOMENT WHEN HE SAID  THIS, YOU SHOW THEM.
YOU CAN SHOW THEM THE MOMENT.
VERY COOL TECHNOLOGY.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU WOLF FOR  SHARING THAT MOMENT WITH ME OF  ALEX WITHIN THE MOMENT WITH  BROOK A MOMENT AGO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF ONLY -- ISN'T IT COOL? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY FOR  PEOPLE TO CAPTURE THIS MOMENT OF  ME ENJOYING THAT MOMENT. [CAMERA SOUND] OH, WOW, WOW! WOW, I'VE GOT TO TWEET THIS  MOMENT AT WOLF. HASHTAG FILLING AIR TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. NOW, FOLKS IT'S THE TIME OF YEAR  AGAIN WHEN SKELETAL FIGURES  SHROUDED IN BLACK FILL YOUR MIND  WITH FEEMPLE THE SUPREME COURT IS IN SESSION. -- WITH FEAR BECAUSE THE SUPREME  COURT IS IN SESSION. THE BIG CASE IS FISHER V  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS.
A DECADE AGO THE COURT RULED  THAT RACE COULD BE USED AS A  FACTOR GRANTING COLLEGE  ADMISSION. TODAY A NEW SUPREME COURT HEARD  A CHALLENGE TO THAT WHICH COULD  CHANGE THE LAW OF THE LAND ON  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WILL  RETURN TO THE SUPREME COURT  DOCKET. IT INVOLVES A WHITE STUDENT  FEMALE WHO CLAIMS AFFIRMATIVE  ACTION WAS THE REASON SHE WAS  SHUT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF  TEXAS.
FOR THE FIRST TIME TO IN TEN  YEARS THE JUSTICES ARE WEIGHING  THE QUESTION:  HAS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RUN ITS COURSE?
YES, BECAUSE DISCRIMINATION  IS OVER. JUST LOOK AT CNN. THEY EMPLOY ON ALL TALENT FROM  ALL ETHNICITIES AND BACKGROUNDS  AND THAT'S JUST SOLEDAD O'BRIEN. THE STUDENT DENIED ADMISSION TO  THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS CLAIMS  HER RACE WAS HELD AGAINST HER  FORCING HER TOLL ATTEND LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY. FOLKS, THERE'S NO GREATER  INJUSTICE THAN HAVING TO ATTEND  YOUR SAFETY SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN I HAD TO  GO TO DARTMOUTH INSTEAD OF MY  FIRST CHOICE HOGWARTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN THEY NEVER -- [ LAUGHTER ] THEY NEVER EVEN RESPONDED TO MY  APPLICATION OWL PROBABLY BECAUSE  HE WAS WHITE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NATION -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT NATION, IT LOOKS LIKE  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION'S DAYS ARE  NUMBERED BECAUSE CHIEF JUSTICE  ROBERT HAS A HISTORY OF OPPOSING THESE TERRIBLE QUOTAS HE SAID  THE WAY TO STOP DISCRIMINATION  ON THE BASIS OF RACE IS TO STOP  DISCRIMINATING ON THE BASIS OF  RACE. YEAH, EVERYBODY JUST KNOCK IT  OFF. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T NEED A  LAW TO STOP THEM FROM  DISCRIMINATING. GIVE THEM A CHANCE AND THEY'LL  DO IT ON THEIR OWN. THAT'S WHY LINCOLN ISSUED THE  EMANCIPATION SUGGESTION. [ LAUGHTER ] HOPEFULLY, FOLKS --  HOPEFULLIES -- WE'LL GET A  SUPREME COURT RULING THAT LEADS  TO A MORE EQUAL WORLD AIM POST RACIAL MET YOUR OK CASEY WHERE  NO ONE IS GIVEN AN ADVANTAGE  BECAUSE OF SKIN COLOR WHERE IN  THE INSTITUTIONS ONLY THE CREAM OF CROP IS CHOSEN AND THE RACE  OF THE STUDENTS DOES NOT MATTER  ANYMORE BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE  ASIAN. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, THAT IS THE FINAL WORD ON  THIS SUBJECT. HERE TO SAY MORE FINAL WORDS ON  IT, PLEASE WELCOME LEGAL EXPERT  AND SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT  YALE LAW SCHOOL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OKAY. GOOD MANY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. FIRST THINGS FIRST, OKAY? HOLD ON. ARE YOU WHITE? OKAY. I HAVE TO ASK. I DON'T SEE RACE. NOT EVEN MY OWN.
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU.
STEPHEN: PEOPLE TELL ME I'M  WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE  I LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE I TALK ABOUT RACE. OKAY? ALL RIGHT. HOW DOES THE LAW STAND RIGHT NOW  IN THIS CASE? IF THE OBAMA GIRLS WERE AMYING  TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS WOULD  THEY GET PREFERENTIAL PLACEMENT  BECAUSE OF RACE?
THE THING ABOUT THEM IS YOU  COULD IMAGINE THEM HAVING AN  ADVANTAGE IN ADMISSION BECAUSE  THEY ARE CELEBRITY KIDS.
STEPHEN: JUST IMAGINE JUST  THEIR FATHER HAD NUCLEAR  WEAPONS. AFRICAN-AMERICAN KIDS GET  PLACEMENT UNDER THESE RULES?
NOT NECESSARILY. IT'S ONE OF PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES  THE SCHOOL CAN TAKE INTO  ACCOUNT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO FAVOR AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN WEALTHY PUBLIC  CAN'T.
STEPHEN: WHAT IS THIS GIRL  COMPLAINING ABOUT?
SHE SAID IT HAPPENED TO HER  BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE RACE IS IN  THE MIX FOR SOME OF THE KIDS WHO GOT IN AND SHE DID NOT.
STEPHEN: WHAT ARE THE  FACTORS LEGACY, IF YOUR DAD GAVE  A LIBRARY.
COMMUNITY SERVICE,  LEADERSHIP, SOCIOECONOMIC  BACKGROUND. YOU HAVE TO WRITE HE ISES IS A. THERE'S A LONG LIST OF THINGS.
STEPHEN: HOW DO YOU THINK  IT'S GOING TO GO?
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO  GO WELL FOR UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS  AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BECAUSE JUSTICE KENNEDY SEEMED  SKEPTICAL. AND HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT  PRIVILEGED AFRICAN-AMERICANS  GETTING A LEGUP OVER POORER  WHITE STUDENTS.
STEPHEN: THERE ARE ONLY  EIGHT JUSTICES BECAUSE KAGAN  RECUSED HERSELF. WHY?
PRESUMABLY SHE WORKED ON THE  CASE BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL US WHY.
STEPHEN: SHOULDN'T  SOTOMAYOR TAKE THEMSELVES OUT OF  IT BECAUSE THEY ARE MINORITIES? JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD A ROUGH  TIME, TOO. THE IRISH 100 YEARS AGO NEED NOT  APPLY ALONG WITH ITALIANS. SHOULDN'T IT JUST BE ROBERTS  DECIDING THIS CASE?
DOESN'T HE HAVE THE MOST SKIN  IN THE GAME BECAUSE IF YOU GET  RID OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THAT BENEFITS MORE WHITE PEOPLE.
STEPHEN: YEAH BUT THAT'S  HOW IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN. DOESN'T THAT SEEM THE MOST  AMERICAN?
HISTORICALLY YOU ARE PROBABLY  RIGHT.
STEPHEN: WHITE MAN IS  NEUTRAL. UNCLE SAM DEFAULT AMERICANS.
THIS ISN'T TRUE.
STEPHEN: HIS YOU ON THE  ROPES. I ALMOST MADE YOU A JEWISH WOMAN  ADMIT I MORE AMERICAN THAN YOU  ARE.
WE LIVE IN A MELTING POT  IMMIGRANT FILLED SOCIETY WITH  ALL RACES AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT  THAT WAY.
STEPHEN: IF AFFIRMATIVE  ACTION IS OVER TURNED WHAT IS  GOING TO THE BE THE GREATEST  EFFECT OF THAT?
WE WOULD HOPE THAT SCHOOLS  WOULD START TAKING MORE  SOCIOECONOMICS INTO ACCOUNT AND  USING THATS AWAY TOY CONTINUE TO HAVE POOR STUDENTS COME INTO  SCHOOL.
STEPHEN: THAT'S ABOUT  CLASS.
THAT IS CLASS BUT THERE WILL  BE FEWER AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND  HISPANIC STUDENTS ADMITTED.
STEPHEN: SO WE COULD BE IN  A CLASS WAR.
I HOPE NOT.
STEPHEN: WE'VE BEEN IN A  RACE WAR.
YOU ARE INVITING A CLASS WAR?
STEPHEN: I'M NOT INVITING  IT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAR I'LL BE  INTO. I WOULD BE TBHRT A RACE WAR THAN  A CLASS WAR BECAUSE I'M IN THE  TOP 1% AND THAT'S A MINORITY. BUT IN A RACE WAR I'M IN THE  MAJORITY.
THAT'S STILL TRUE BUT NOT FOR  THAT LONG.
STEPHEN: REALLY?
YEAH.
STEPHEN: CAN WE HAVE A  SUPREME COURT CASE ABOUT THAT?
ABOUT HAVING MORE WHITE  PEOPLE HAVE A HIGHER BIRTH RATE? I DON'T THINK SOX WE'LL CONTINUE  TO BE MORE AND MORE DIVERSE. IT'S A GOOD THING.
STEPHEN: I BELIEVE THAT ALL  PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED  OR COLOR HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SADDLED WITH CRUSHING STUDENT  DEBT FOR THE REST OF THEIR  LIVES. PLEASE COME BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANKS, EMILY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
