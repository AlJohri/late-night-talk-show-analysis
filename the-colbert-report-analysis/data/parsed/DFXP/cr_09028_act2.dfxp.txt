(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY  SINGER/SONG WRITER WHO HAS  COMPOSED OVER 3,000 SONGS. I'LL ASK HER IF ONE OF THEM WAS  "GANGNAM STYLE."  (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME DOLLY PARTON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT A PLEASURE, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR COMING ON.
OKAY!
Stephen: WHAT AN HONOR TO  HAVE YOU ON.
WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE  WITH YOU. I WATCH YOU ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: AS A LITTLE BOY  GROWING UP IN SOUTH CAROLINA I  WATCHED THE WATER WAGGONER SHOW.
THAT'S GREAT!
Stephen: HUGE COUNTRY MUSIC  SHOW SATURDAY AFTERNOONS RIGHT  AFTER THE CARTOONS WERE OVER AND I ALWAYS HAD TO SEE WHETHER  DOLLY WAS GOING TO BE ON THE  SHOW.
I STARTED THAT SHOW IN 1967  SO YOU WAS A TINY LITTLE THING.
Stephen: I HAD A LITTLE CRUSH  ON YOU. I DID.
THANK YOU NOW!
Stephen: AND YOU KNOW YOU'VE  DONE IT ALL, YOU'RE A COUNTRY  MUSIC AND A CROSSOVER LEGEND, QUEEN OF BOTH COUNTRY AND POP,  SOLD OVER 100 MILLION RECORDS,  "JOLENE" "COAT OF MANY COLORS" "I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU."  YOU'VE BEEN A SONGWRITER, SINGER  PERFORMER, OSCAR NOMINEE, EMMY  NOMINEE. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE  THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO?
I WANT TO DO MORE OF THE SAME  STUFF AND I JUST WAKE UP WITH  NEW DREAMS EVERYDAY. I NEVER KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO  DO NEXT.
Stephen: SO BASICALLY YOU  WANT TO SAY TO GOD "I WANT MORE  OF THE SAME, PLEASE."
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER ROUND.
Stephen: OKAY. WELL YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK  CALLED "DREAM MORE: CELEBRATING  THE DREAMER IN YOU."
YES.
Stephen: DO WE REALLY WANT TO  DREAM MORE? BECAUSE I OFTEN DREAM ABOUT  FIGHTING BEARS. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU PROBABLY DO, BUT  YOU NEED TO DREAM MORE. SO IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD, THIS  BOOK TALKS ABOUT DREAMING MORE  AND BEING ABLE TO GET OUT THERE AND PUT WINGS AND LEGS AND ARMS  ON YOUR DREAMS. IN OTHER WORDS GET OUT AND MAKE  THEM COME TRUE.
Stephen: WINGS ON YOUR  DREAMS.
WINGS ON YOUR LEGS, ARMS ON  YOUR DREAMS. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A HIDEOUS DREAM  MONSTER.
WELL THIS IS REALLY A LITTLE  BOOK THAT ALL THE MONEY GOES TO  THE FOUNDATION, WE HAVE A LITERACY PROGRAM CALLED THE  IMAGINATION LIBRARY.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE  IMAGINATION LIBRARY? IS THAT A LIBRARY FULL OF  IMAGINARY BOOKS OR IS IT A --
(LAUGHS)  NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S A LIBRARY  WHERE WE ACTUALLY GIVE CHILDREN  A BOOK A MONTH FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN UNTIL THEY START  SCHOOL SO THEY CAN LEARN TO  READ. IT STARTED IN MY HOMETOWN AND  --.
Stephen: IN SEVEREVILLE.
IN SEVEREVILLE, TENNESSEE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE  THAT EVER SAYS THAT RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL, I'M FROM THE  SOUTH. THAT'S A TOUGH NAME FOR A CHILD  TO GROW UP IN. SEVEREVILLE.
THAT'S HOW YOU PRONOUNCE IT.
Stephen: WAS IT SEVERE?
WELL, IT WAS AT TIMES, YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE ONE 1206  KIDS.
THAT'S RIGHT. SIX GIRLS AND SIX BOYS.
Stephen: I'M ONE OF 11 KIDS. EIGHT BOYS, THREE GIRLS.
WELL, YOU'RE PROBABLY  CATHOLIC, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND I'M GUESSING  YOU'RE NOT!
WE WERE JUST HILLBILLIES. (LAUGHTER)  I GUESS YOU WERE TOO, RIGHT?
Stephen: HOW FAST CAN YOU SAY  YOUR BROTHER AND SISTERS NAMES? WANT TO RACE? I'LL GIVE YOU ONE NAME HEAD  START. READY, ONE, TWO, THREE, GO. (BOTH SPEAKING AT ONCE)  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD.
OH, THAT'S CUTE!
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE KNOWN --  YOU HAVE TALENTS. YOU'RE KNOWN AS BEING A VERY  GENUINE PERSON. CAN YOU TEACH KNOW FAKE THAT? (LAUGHTER)
I CAN FAKE THROUGH IT.
Stephen: IT IS EYE CONTACT? IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
WELL, SOME OF IT IS. WHAT DO YOU ANY ARE YOU FALLING  FOR IT?
I FELL FOR YOU IN 1974.
THAT'S SWEET. WELL MAYBE WE CAN KEEP IT UP SO  WE CAN SEE HOW THAT GOES.
Stephen: SURE. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THIS BOOK WAS ORIGINALLY A  SPEECH THAT YOU GAVE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, RIGHT?
ACTUALLY, IT WAS. I DID THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH  THREE YEARS AGO AT U.T. AND I  WAS VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE SPEECHES, I DON'T  FEEL LIKE I'M SMART ENOUGH OR  EDUCATED ENOUGH IN THAT WAY TO TALK TO ALL THOSE EDUCATED  PEOPLE. BUT SINCE IT WAS MY HOME AREA  AND I HAD BECOME -- I HAD DONE  PRETTY GOOD FOR A LOCAL GIRL THEY ACCEPTED ME. IT DIDN'T HURT THAT I CAME OUT  SINGING "ROCKY TOP" WHICH IS  THEIR THEME SONG THERE. SO BY THE TIME WE FINISHED IT  WENT OVER WELL AND THEN THEY  ENCOURAGED ME TO EXPAND ON IT AND WRITE THE BOOK. IF IN OUR IMAGINATION LIBRARY WE  HAVE WHAT WE CALL FOUR  PRINCIPLES OR STEPS. IT'S LIKE DREAM MORE, LEARN MORE  CARE MORE, BE MORE.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT MAKE  MORE?
I'M FAR, TOO. YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE  MORE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T HAVE TO  CARE MORE.
(LAUGHS)  THAT'S TRUE!
Stephen: WELL, I'VE HAD A  DREAM WHICH IS THAT I'D LOVE TO  DO A SONG WITH YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  CAN I DO A SONG WITH YOU? ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BE B RIGHT BACK  WITH A PERFORMANCE BY THE
