Stephen:  HERE TO PERFORM A SONG FROM HIS ALBUM AND BROADWAY-BOUND MUSICAL "THE LAST SHIP," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, STING. ♪ IT'S ALL THERE IN THE GOSPELS ♪ A MAGDALENE GIRL COMES TO PAY HER RESPECTS  ♪ BUT HER MIND IS AWHIRL WHEN SHE FINDS THE TOMB EMPTY, THE STONE HAD BEEN ROLLED, NOT A SIGN OF A CORPSE IN THE DARK AND THE COLD.  WHEN SHE REACHES THE DOOR, SEES AN UNHOLY SIGHT THERE'S THIS SOLITARY FIGURE IN A HALO OF LIGHT  ♪ HE JUST CARRIES ON FLOATING PAST CAVALRY HILL  IN AN ALMIGHTY HURRY  ♪ AYE, BUT SHE MIGHT CATCH HIM STILL  ♪ TELL ME WHERE ARE YE GOING LORD, AND WHY IN SUCH HASTE? ♪ NOW DON'T HINDER ME WOMAN, I  HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE.  FOR THEY'RE LAUNCHING A BOAT ON  ♪ THE MORROW AT NOON  ♪ AND I HAVE TO BE THERE BEFORE DAYBREAK  ♪ OH, I CANNOT BE MISSING THE LADS WILL EXPECT ME  ♪ WHY ELSE WOULD THE GOOD LORD HIMSELF RESURRECT ME?  ♪ NOTHING WILL STOP ME. I HAVE TO PREVAIL THROUGH THE TEETH OF THIS TEMPEST IN THE MOUTH OF A GAIL. MAY THE ANGELS PROTECT ME IF ALL ELSE SHOULD ♪ FAIL WHEN THE LAST SHIP SAILS OH THE ROAR OF THE CHAINS AND THE CRACKING OF TIMBERS  ♪ THE NOISE AT THE END OF THE WORLD IN YOUR EARS  ♪ AS A MOUNTAIN OF STEEL MAKES ITS WAY TO THE SEA  ♪ AND THE LAST SHIP SAILS AND WHATEVER YOU'RE PROMISED  ♪ WHATEVER YOU'VE DONE  ♪ AND WHATEVER THE STATION IN LIFE YOU'VE BECOME  ♪ IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER IN THE NAME OF THE SON ♪ AND WHATEVER THE WEAVE OF THIS LIFE THAT YOU'VE SPUN ON THE  EARTH OR IN HEAVEN  ♪ OR UNDER THE SUN  ♪ WHEN THE LAST SHIP SAILS ♪ OH, THE ROAR OF THE CHAINS AND THE CRACKIN' OF TIMBERS  ♪ THE NOISE AT THE END OF THE WORLD IN YOUR EARS  ♪ AS A MOUNTAIN OF STEEL MAKES ITS WAY TO THE SEA  ♪ AND THE LAST SHIP SAILS   ♪
Stephen:  STING. "THE LAST SHIP"!
