Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THE HOLIDAY SEASON IS HERE, AND WHETHER YOU CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS, HANUKKAH, KWANZAA, OR LET'S BE SERIOUS, CHRISTMAS, IT'S A VERY STRESSFUL TIME OF YEAR FOR US WEALTH-MERICANS. IT'S SO HARD TO FIND THE PERFECT PRESENT. FOR MY HIGH-NET-WORK VIEWERS I'M SANTA'S LITTLE HELPER. THIS IS "COLBERT PLATINUM." ♪  ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) HOLIDAY GIFT EDITION. REMEMBER, THIS SEGMENT IS FOR PLATINUM MEMBERS ONLY. SO IF YOU HAD TO BLEACH YOUR REGULAR TIGER TO GET IT WHITE, WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG AND BUY SOME SWEAT PANTS WITH WORDS ON THE BUTT. THEY'RE PROBABLY GONE BY NOW. FOLKS, THE HOLIDAYS ARE ALL ABOUT FAMILY, AND THERE'S NO BETTER GIFT FOR YOUR FAMILY THAN DONATING MONEY TO GET YOUR FAMILY NAME ON AS MANY THINGS AS POSSIBLE. IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GIVE TO YOUR COMMUNITY A SENSE OF JUST HOW RICH YOU ARE. JUST ASK BILLIONAIRE INDUSTRIALIST DAVID H. KOCH. HE'S GOT THE DAVID H. KOCH PLAZA AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM. THE DAVID H. KOCH BALLET THEATER, AND THE NATURAL  HISTORY MUSEUM'S DAVID H. KOCH DINOSAUR WING. THE "H,," OF COURSE, IS FOR HUMBLE. AND GETTING YOUR NAME PLASTERED EVERYWHERE IS THE CLOSEST WE CAN COME TO IMMORTALITY. BUT AS ONE PLATINUM FAMILY RECENTLY LEARNED, IMMORTALITY DOESN'T LAST FOREVER.
IF YOU'RE A FAN OF AVERY FISHER HALL AT LINCOLN CENTER, GET READY FOR THE SOUND OF A NEW NAME. THE CONCERT SPACE WILL UNDERGO MAJOR RENOVATIONS COSTING A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. MAJOR DONORS WILL HAVE TO BE COURTED TO PAY FOR IT, AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE NAMING RIGHTS. THE LINCOLN CENTER IS PAYING AVERY FISHER'S CHILDREN $15 MILLION TO DROP HIS NAME.
Stephen:  THEY GAVE UP THE NAMING RIGHTS TO AVERY FISHER HALL FOR A LOUSY $15 MILLION? FOR THAT KIND OF CHUMP CHANGE YOU CAN'T GET THE NAMING RIGHTS TO DARYL HALL. FOLKS, THE LESSON I TAKE FROM THIS IS THAT SOMEBODY OUT THERE CAN MAKE A TON OF MONEY BY SELLING THE NAMING RIGHTS. AND PLATINUM DADDY WANTS IN ON THIS ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WITH JUST TWO DAYS LEFT-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- I SOLD THE NAMING RIGHTS TO MY SHOW TO DEWAR'S SCOTCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YES.  NOW CALLED STEPHEN CAN THE THE COLB-DEWAR'S REPEWARS." ♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK. ♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK DRINK, DRINK, DRINK, DRINK. ♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK DEWAR'S RESPONSIBLY ♪♪ ♪ DRINK, DRINK, DRINK DEWAR'S RESPONSIBLY ♪♪ THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH SOME CASH. HEY, HERE'S A FUN LITTLE PARTY GAME-- DRINK DEWAR'S EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD "DRINK." FOLKS, I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS AN EASY DECISION TO GO WITH DEWAR'S. ONE, THEIR CHECK CLEARED. WELL, THAT'S IT, FOR THE LAST-EVER EDITION OF "COLBERT PLATINUM." ( APPLAUSE ) SO GOOD-BYE TO MY "HIGH-NET-WORTH VIEWERS. I'LL SEE YOU WHEN THEY LINE US UP AGAINST THE WALL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
