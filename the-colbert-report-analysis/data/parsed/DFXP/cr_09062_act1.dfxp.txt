Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THESE  FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU  MAKE ME WANT TO SHAKE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WANT  TO WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY  VALENTINE'S DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HOPE YOU'RE SPENDING IT WITH  SOMEONE YOU LOVE. AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING MY SHOW,  YOU ARE. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TO  HOLIDAYS, I'M AN ORIGINALIST. ON CHRISTMAS, IT'S NOT SANTA  CLAUS, IT'S SINTERKLAAS. YOU LEAVE OUT YOUR SHOES FOR HIM  TO FILL WITH NUTS AND DRIED  FRUIT, OR, IF YOU'VE BEEN NAUGHTY, YOU'RE KIDNAPPED BY HIS  MOORISH ELFIN SIDEKICK BLACK  PETER. [LAUGHTER] HO, HO, HO. [LAUGHTER] AND I HAVE THE SAME RIGOROUS  STANDARDS FOR SAINT VALENTINE'S  DAY. I FOCUS ON WHAT THE DAY'S REALLY  ABOUT: NOT THE CHOCOLATES, OR  THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS, OR THE FANCY JEWELRY-- ALTHOUGH I LOVE  GETTING ALL OF THAT. [LAUGHTER] NO, THE TRUE MEANING OF  VALENTINE'S DAY IS ALL ABOUT THE  L-WORD:  LUPERCALIA!--THE MID-FEBRUARY ROMAN FERTILITY FEAST THAT  ST.VALENTINE'S DAY IS BASED ON. [LAUGHTER] AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW, LUPERCALIA  IS NAMED FOR LUPA, THE SHE-WOLF  WHO SUCKLED ROME'S TWIN FOUNDERS ROMULUS AND REMUS. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, I SAY THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG  WITH KIDS TODAY: NOT ENOUGH  WOLF-TEAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] SO TO THE GUYS WATCHING THE  SHOW, A LITTLE HINT, AFTER THE  SHOW  TONIGHT, I WANT YOU TO CELEBRATE A TRADITIONAL VALENTINE'S DAY --  BY GUZZLING A COUPLE OF SKINS  FULL OF WINE, SACRIFICING A GOAT TO VENUS, WEARING ITS SKIN, AND  RACING THROUGH YOUR TOWN,  WHIPPING ANY WOMEN YOU PASS WITH A SHORT LEATHER THONG TO PROMOTE  FERTILITY. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, ROMANCE! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EITHER THAT, OR YOU KNOW PICK UP  SOME ROSES AT THE DELI. GIRLS LIKE THAT STUFF. [LAUGHTER] NATION, IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS  SINCE THE ECONOMIC MELTDOWN. AND WHILE EVEN I USED TO BE MAD  AT WALL STREET-- AT THIS POINT,  WHO CAN EVEN REMEMBER WHO WIRED THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO A  ROULETTE WHEEL WHILE JACKED ON  ENOUGH COCAINE TO BRING DOWN A  BISON? [LAUGHTER] AND YET THE  MADDOW-BLAZER-WEARING EZRA  KLEIN-HOLES OUT THERE ARE STILL  CALLING FOR BANKERS TO GO TO  JAIL. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST LET BYGONE  PENSIONS BE BYGONES? [LAUGHTER] NOW THE BANKS ARE ALSO GETTING  HEAT FROM CONGRESS. AND NOT IN THE USUAL WAY, WITH A  WARM TONGUE BATH. [LAUGHTER] NO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TWO WEEKS AGO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CALM DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] ALSO A BIG PART OF LUPACALIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TWO WEEKS AGO, SENATORS CHUCK  GRASSLEY AND SHERROD BROWN  ACCUSED THE BANKS OF NOT ONLY BEING TOO BIG TO FAIL BUT ALSO,  "TOO BIG TO JAIL." [LAUGHTER] MAYBE SO. BUT HAVEN'T THEY BEEN PUNISHED  ENOUGH WITH STINGING WORDPLAY  LIKE THAT? [LAUGHTER] AND FOLKS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW  THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME  BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS ON WALL STREET. WE'RE SUPER-TIGHT. THEY CALL ME UP AND GIVE ME  STOCK TIPS, AND I PAY THEM. [LAUGHTER] WELL, I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR  MY BRO-- KERS [LAUGHTER] THE GOVERNMENT HAS FINALLY GROWN  A PAIR.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 16  STATES DECLARED A KIND OF LEGAL  WAR ON S&P, THE HUGE RATINGS  AGENCY.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  ACCUSES S&P OF A SCHEME TO  DEFRAUD INVESTORS.
THE FEDS HAVE FILED A $5  BILLION LAWSUIT AGAINST THE  RATING AGENCY STANDARD AND POOR'S, CLAIMING THAT IT  COMMITTED FRAUD WHEN IT GAVE  HIGH RATINGS TO RISKY MORTGAGES.
Stephen: THE GOVERNMENT  CLAIMS STANDARD AND POOR'S  COMMITTED FRAUD BY GIVING TRIPLE-A RATINGS TO WHAT IT KNEW  WERE WORTHLESS SECURITIES. FOLKS, THAT'S (bleep)! [LAUGHTER] (bleep), BY THE WAY, ALSO GETS A  TRIPLE-A RATING FROM STANDARD  AND POOR'S. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, TODAY THEY COME FOR THE  RATINGS AGENCIES, TOMORROW THEY  COME FOR THE BANKS, AND THAT'S THE LAST THING OUR ECONOMY  NEEDS. A GALLUP POLL FOUND THAT  CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN BANKS IS  ALREADY AT AN ALL-TIME LOW. THAT INCLUDES THE 1930'S, WHEN  BANKERS LOWERED CONFIDENCE BY  OCCASIONALLY LANDING ON  CONSUMERS. [LAUGHTER] AND I BELIEVE THAT AN  INVESTIGATION WILL JUST MAKE  THINGS WORSE. I DON'T THINK THE BANKS ARE IN  ANY FINANCIAL POSITION TO REVEAL  WHAT FINANCIAL POSITION THEY'RE  IN. [LAUGHTER] TAKE WELLS FARGO. THEIR RECENT ANNUAL REPORT SAID  THAT THE BANK'S VALUE IS PARTLY  BASED ON, QUOTE, "SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS NOT OBSERVABLE IN  THE MARKET." [LAUGHTER] THAT MEANS THE VALUE OF THE  LARGEST CAPITALIZED BANK IN THE  UNITED STATES DEFIES  OBSERVATION. [LAUGHTER] THE HUMAN MIND CANNOT PERCEIVE  IT. WE DARE NOT LOOK UPON IT. [LAUGHTER] REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO THE  ACCOUNTANTS WHO OPENED LEHMAN  BROTHERS' BOOKS. [LAUGHTER] POINT IS, I BELIEVE WHEN IT  COMES TO OUR ECONOMY, THERE ARE  THINGS WE JUST SHOULDN'T KNOW. HERE TO KNOW THEM AT ME IS  FINANCIAL WRITER AND WASHINGTON  BUREAU CHIEF OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES," DAVID LEONHARDT. DAVE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF NEW E-BOOK  "HERE IS THE DEAL" AVAILABLE ON  ELECTRONIC EVERYWHERE. DAVE, WHY ARE THEY GOING AFTER  S&P? DO THEY HAVE THE GOODS ON THE  AGENCIES IN.
THEY MAY HAVE THE GOODS. THE HUGE HOUSING BUBBLE AND THE  BANKS WERE PACKAGING TOGETHER  THE MORTGAGES.
CAUSED BY POOR PEOPLE BEING  GREEDY GO. HEAD.
AND S&P COMES IN AND SAID  THEY ARE AAA RATED THEY CANNOT  GO BAD AND THEY ARE PERFECTLY  SAFE. THEY DID GO BAD. THE GOVERNMENT HAS E-MAILS WITH  STANDARD & POOR'S TELLING HOW  THEY RATE THE THICKS. THEY LOOK BAD. IS IT CRIMINAL? THEIR DEFENSE IS THEY ARE NO  DIFFERENT FROM JOURNALISTS.
WHY NOT PUT FINANCIAL WRITERS  LIKE YOU IN JAIL FOR TELLING US  THINGS ARE BAD WHICH UNDERMINES CONSUMER CONFIDENCE? [LAUGHTER]
SO BACK THEN THERE WERE A LOT  OF JOURNALISTS OUT THERE WHO  TRIED TO ARGUE THAT HOUSING WAS IN A BUBBLE AND STANDARD &  POOR'S WAS ONE.
Stephen: WERE YOU ONE OF  THEM?
I WAS.
Stephen: WHOOPDIDO.
THEY SAID PRICES CAN NEVER GO  DOWN.
Stephen: IF WE GO AFTER THE  RATINGS AGENCY, ISN'T THE NEXT  THING TO GO AFTER THE BANK?
THEY ARE GOING AFTER SOME  BANKS.
Stephen: AND HOW?
THERE HAVE BEEN PRIVATE SUITS  GOING AFTER BANKS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EXACTLY  PUT A LOT OF BANKERS IN JAIL.
Stephen: ANY.
MAYBE NOT ANY ACTUALLY.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S A FAIRLY LOW NUMBER.
IT'S A LOW NUMBER. HARD TO GO MUCH LOWER.
Stephen: YEAH, OKAY. NOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THICKS ARE DIFFERENT NOW THOUGH  THAN IN 20072008, RIGHT?
THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT  DIFFERENT.
Stephen: BACK THEN IT WAS  TOO BIG TO FAIL. ARE THEY THE SAME SIZE?
BANKS ARE PROBABLY ALWAYS  GOING BE TOO BIG TO TOO FAIL. THAT IS THE MISERABLE THING  ABOUT THIS. A MD YEARN ECONOMY NEEDS BANKS  AND PROBABLY NEEDS BIG BANKS.
Stephen: IF THEY ARE TOO  BIG TO FAIL AND EVIDENTLY TOO  BIG TO JAIL, DO ANY LAWS APPLY TO BANKS?
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO AMY TO  BANKS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACTUAL  LAY PLY IS SAY GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: IT IS. THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER]
ONE OF CRITICISMS IS THIS  NOTION THAT WE ALLOW THEM TO  MAKE THE PROFIT AND WE THE TAXPAYERS TAKE THE LOSS.
Stephen: YOU SAY BANKS  SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR INSURANCE  AHEAD OF TIME.
IT'S ONE OF IDEAS OUT THERE.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT AIG. THEY WERE THAT.
THAT DIDN'T GO SO WELL.
WE HAD TO BAIL THEM OUT TO  THE TUNE OF 160 BILLION TO 180  BILLION.
THE ACTUAL ENSURERS ARE GOING  ALONG WITH THE BANK AND S&P AND  EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT, DON'T WORRY HERE. THAT'S YOUR SET ASIDE THIS MONEY  IN ADVANCE. YOU SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, EVEN IF  EVERYONE IS TILLING US  EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT. THERE'S NO WAY THE MARKET CAN  CRASH WE HAVE THIS SAFETY NET.
Stephen: DO YOU KNOW WHY  IT'S A GREAT COUNTRY? BECAUSE ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH  WE WOULD LINE THEM UP AND SHOOT  THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
