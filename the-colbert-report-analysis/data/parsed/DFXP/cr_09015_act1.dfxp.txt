STEPHEN: TONIGHT, QUESTIONS  ABOUT THE LIBYA CRISIS. COULD IT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED  WITH BAYONETS AND HORSES? [ LAUGHTER ] PLUS, A GOP SENATE CANDIDATE  PUTS HIS FOOT IN HIS MOUTH. I HOPE IT WASN'T IN AN AIRPORT  BATHROOM. AND I HOPE IT WAS A FOOT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND MY GUEST ANTHONY EVERITT IS  AN EXPERT ON ANCIENT ROMAN  CULTURE. OR SO HE CLAIMS-- ANYONE WHO  COULD CONTRADICT HIM IS DEAD! [ LAUGHTER ] ONLY SEVEN DAYS UNTIL HALLOWEEN! BUT I TELL MY KIDS IT'S TEN. I GET SOME GREAT DEALS ON  COSTUMES. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT! ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HAPPY WEDNESDAY. FOLKS, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT. WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE HERE  BECAUSE --  FOLKS, HUGE NEWS. WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING TO BRING  YOU THE BIGGEST ELECTION STORY. AND RUMORS STARTED MONDAY ABOUT  A GAME-CHANGING OCTOBER  SURPRISE.
DONALD TRUMP NOW CLAIMS TO  HAVE A BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT  ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT FROM  DONALD TRUMP COMING TODAY, AND  WHY IT MIGHT CHANGE YOUR VOTE IN  THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
I HAVE SOMETHING VERY VERY  BIG. IT'S VERY BIG. BIGGER THAN ANYONE WOULD KNOW. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY BIG, I  KNOW ONE THING-- YOU WILL COVER  IT IN A VERY BIG FASHION.
STEPHEN: YES, BOARD UP YOUR  WINDOWS, STOCK UP ON CANNED  MEATS --THIS WILL BE THE  BIGGEST, CLASSIEST, MOST DEVASTATING ELECTION  GAME-CHANGER IN THE HUMAN  HISTORY OF TIME. OKAY? THINK TEAPOT DOME, ONLY THE  TEAPOT IS ENCRUSTED WITH GOLD  AND WE'RE USING DIAMOND TEA  BAGS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SPECULATION WAS RAMPANT. WAS IT THE LONG-RUMORED OBAMA  DIVORCE PAPERS? PROOF THAT OBAMA'S WHITE HALF IS  ALSO BLACK? [ LAUGHTER ] NO, EVEN BIGGER. TRUMP DROPPED A TEN-MEGA-TRUMP  BOMBSHELL.
IF BARACK OBAMA OPENS UP AND  GIVES HIS COLLEGE RECORDS AND  APPLICATIONS; AND IF HE GIVES  HIS PASSPORT APPLICATIONS AND RECORDS; I WILL GIVE TO A  CHARITY OF HIS CHOICE-- INNER  CITY CHILDREN IN CHICAGO,  AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AIDS RESEARCH, ANYTHING HE WANTS--  A  CHECK, IMMEDIATELY, FOR FIVE  MILLION DOLLARS. ONE CAVEAT:  THE RECORDS MUST BE  GIVEN BY OCTOBER 31ST AT 5:00 IN  THE AFTERNOON.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT. HE HAS TO HAVE IT BY 5:00 ON  HALLOWEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE THAT NIGHT  HE'S RENTING OUT HIS ENORMOUS  ORANGE HEAD AS A JACK-O-LANTERN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, WITH DONALD TRUMP, IT'S  NOT ABOUT HIM. IT'S ABOUT HELPING.
FRANKLY, IT'S A CHECK THAT I  VERY MUCH WANT TO WRITE. MR. PRESIDENT, NOT ONLY WILL I  BE HAPPY, AND BY THE WAY TOTALLY  SATISFIED, BUT THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THOSE CHARITIES WILL BE VERY  HAPPY.
STEPHEN: NATION, I AM SO  MOVED BY THIS GENEROUS OFFER  THAT I HAVE AN OFFER OF MY OWN. RIGHT OVER HERE. MR. TRUMP,  I WILL WRITE YOU A  CHECK FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS  FROM COLBERT SUPER PAC-- YOU  KNOW I'VE GOT IT-- TO THE CHARITY OF YOUR CHOICE. ANYTHING: SAVE THE CHILDREN,  FEED THE CHILDREN, PUT THE  CHILDREN ON CHILD APPRENTICE,  WHATEVER. ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- IF YOU  WILL LET ME DIP MY BALLS IN YOUR  MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THIS DIPPING HAS TO BE TO  -- AND I HOPE YOU ARE LISTENING  CAREFULLY MR. TRUMP, THIS  DIPPING HAS TO BE TO MY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY MY BALLS'  SATISFACTION. OKAY? [ LAUGHTER ] ONE CAVEAT: MY BALLS MUST BE IN  YOUR MOUTH BY NO LATER THAN 5:00  P.M. OCTOBER 31ST. OKAY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] MY BALLS HAVE A THING THAT  NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER  THAN TO WRITE THIS CHECK. AND NOTHING WOULD MAKE AMERICA  HAPPIER THAN TO HAVE SOMETHING  GOING INTO YOUR MOUTH INSTEAD OF  SOMETHING COMING OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S DO THIS FOR THE KIDS. BUT THERE'S AN ISSUE IN THIS  ELECTION EVEN BIGGER THAN DONALD  TRUMP. IT'S LIBYA. YOU SEE, ON SEPTEMBER 11, THE  AMERICAN CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI  WAS ATTACKED. FOUR AMERICANS INCLUDING OUR  AMBASSADOR WERE KILLED. FOLLOWING THIS TRAGEDY PRESIDENT  OBAMA ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION  AND PROMISED TO BRING THOSE  RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE. BUT IT APPEARED THAT THE  ADMINISTRATION WAS WITHOLDING  INFORMATION TO AVOID BEING  BLAMED FOR A TERRORIST ATTACK ON THEIR WATCH RIGHT BEFORE THE  ELECTION. THIS HAS LEFT SOME TROUBLING  QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS THAT FOX NEWS HAS NOT  BEEN AFRAID TO ASK 24 HOURS A  DAY FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS.
WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS?
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE  INTELLIGENCE?
WHAT WENT WRONG, WHY WAS THE  INTELLIGENCE NOT RECOGNIZED AND  ACTED UPON?
SPECIAL REPORT. WHO DID THIS AND HOW? SHOULD OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE SEEN  IT COME SOMETHING IN DID  PRESIDENT OBAMA TRY TO HIDE THE  TRUTH? IS THIS A HUGE SCANDAL THAT  EXPOSES A FAILED OBAMA FOREIGN  POLICY? OR IS MITT ROMNEY JUST SAYING IT  IS?
STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T OUR  CONSULATE HAVE MORE SECURITY? WHY WAS THE INTELLIGENCE SO SLOW  TO COME OUT? AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF YOU PUT  A STATEMENT IN THE FORM OF A  QUESTION, IS IT JOURNALISM? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION  IMPLY THESE ATTACKS WERE INCITED  BY A YOUTUBE VIDEO THAT INSULTS  THE PROPHET MOHAMMED? WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO CHIME  IN?
WHY, WHY WOULD HE -- HE AND  HIS ADMINISTRATION -- SPEAK  REPEATEDLY ABOUT THAT LITTLE  VIDEO AND WITH SUCH AUTHORITY AND CERTAINTY?
WHY WOULD THEY COME UP WITH  THE VIDEO?
ARE WE REALLY GOING TO BLAME  A VIDEO? [ LAUGHTER ]
STEPHEN: HOW COULD A VIDEO  POSSIBLY INCITE VIOLENCE? JIMMY, WHY DON'T WE WATCH IT? ♪ ♪
STEPHEN: WHY HAS MY NETWORK  FORBIDDEN ME TO SHOW THAT VIDEO? DID OBAMA GET TO THEM? [ LAUGHTER ] OR IS THERE SOME OTHER QUESTION  I SHOULD BE ASKING? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
DID THE PRESIDENT, DID HIS  TEAM, CALL THIS AN ACT OF TERROR  FROM THE START? WHY DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE SUCH  TROUBLE SAYING THAT?
DOES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  HAVE A PROBLEM CALLLING IT  TERROR?
STEPHEN: WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL  IT TERROR RIGHT AWAY? AND DON'T YOU MISS THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION, WHEN WE KNEW  EXACTLY HOW AFRAID TO BE THANKS  TO A COLOR-CODED SCALE THAT CHANGED BASED ON THREATS THEY  OFTEN WOULDN'T EXPLAIN? HEY, WHAT'S THAT NOISE? DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING? DON'T YOU FEEL SAFER NOW THAT  I'VE TOLD YOU THERE MIGHT BE  SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID OF? OR ARE WE NOT SCARED ENOUGH OF  TERROR BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA  MIGHT NOT BE TELLING US ENOUGH  TO BE TERRIFIED ABOUT? DID I HAVE TIME TO WASH MY HANDS  JUST NOW? IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT, DID IT? SPEAKING OF FILTH, ARE THERE  MORE HEINOUS ASSERTIONS WE COULD  BE PULLING OUT OF OUR ASS?
HERE'S THE OTHER QUESTION. AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER  QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ASK --  DID WE TRADE OFF-- AND I HAVE NO  EVIDENCE OF THIS-- DID WE TRADE OFF THE LIFE OF OUR AMBASSADOR  AND THREE OTHER AMERICANS FOR  THAT CROWD? -- WERE THESE PEOPLE EXPENDABLE  AS PART OF A MIDEAST FOREIGN  POLICY?
STEPHEN: WHILE WE'RE THROWING  AROUND ACCUSATIONS WITH NO  EVIDENCE, WHAT WAS PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S ROLE IN 9/11? WHAT WAS HIS ROLE IN LANCE  ARMSTRONG'S DOPING SCANDAL? [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN MORE TROUBLING, WHY DOES  PETER JOHNSON, JR., HAVE A NAME  THAT'S THREE EUPHEMISMS FOR  PENIS? [ LAUGHTER ] AND COULD THIS JUST BE A  COMPLICATED AND TRAGIC SITUATION  THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  WANTS TO PUT THE BEST POSSIBLE FACE ON FOR POLITICAL REASONS,  AND THAT THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN  WANTS TO PUT THE WORST POSSIBLE  FACE ON FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL  REASONS? AND IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH  THAT? AND IS THERE ANYTHING MORE TO  SAY ABOUT THIS STORY, OR ARE WE  ON A METAPHORICAL TREADMILL? [ LAUGHTER ] AND IS THAT BAD FOR OUR  METAPHORICAL KNEES? SHOULD WE BE USING A  METAPHORICAL ELLIPTICAL? [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ULTIMATELY, THE QUESTION IS,  HOW MANY QUESTIONS DO WE HAVE TO  ASK BEFORE VOTERS FORGET  PRESIDENT OBAMA KILLED BIN  LADEN? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
