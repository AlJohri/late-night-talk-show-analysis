( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ARNE DUNCAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). GOOD TO SEE YOU. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS.
NICE TO BE BACK.
Stephen:  NICE TO HAVE A CABINET MEMBER HERE. TELL YOUR BOSS TO STOP BY SOMETIME. >>IL.
Stephen:  BEFORE WE GET INTO THE NITTY GRIF GRITTY, TODAY IS CONSTITUTION DAY, IS THAT TRUE?
YES, SIR.
Stephen:  I WANT TO ASK YOU A LITTLE QUIZ SEE HOW WELL YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTION.
PUT ME ON THE SPOT.
Stephen:  WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION-- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. OR IT WAS THE FIRST ONE? WHY DO WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION?
THE ANSWER IS A, BUT WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ THE CONSTITUTION.
Stephen:  OKAY, ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELL PLAYED. WELL PLAYED. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION'S GOALS FOR EDUCATION. WHAT IS "RACE TO THE TOP" AND WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE ABOUT RACE WITH THIS GUY? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
THIS RACE IS IMPORTANT.
Stephen:  OKAY, WHAT IS IT? WHAT RACE TO THE TOP?
WE WANT TO LEAD THE WORLD IN COLLEGE GRADUATION RATES. WE DID IT A GENERATION AGO. TODAY WE'RE 12th. WE NEED TO CATCH UP.
Stephen:  WHO IS BEATING US?
MANY COUNTRIES.
Stephen:  I DON'T LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES NOW.
WE HAVE TO REDUCE HOOFL DROPOUT RATE, INCREASE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERY CHILD HAS A CHANCE TO MAKE A GREAT EDUCATION.
Stephen:  IS COLLEGE FOR EVERYBODY? I WENT TO COLLEGE AND LEARNED ABOUT MORRISSEY. YOU KNOW.
LET ME START, IF YOU DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TODAY YOU'RE BASICALLY CONDEMNED TO POVERTY AND SOCIAL FAILURE. THERE ARE NO GOOD JOBS OUT THERE. YOU HAVE TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IN SOME FORM OF HIGHER EDUCATION I WOULD ARGUE IS RIGHT FOR EVERYONE.
Stephen:  AND IN THE RACE TO THE TOP, ARE WE STILL LEAVING NO CHILD BEHIND OR DO WE HAVE TO CUT THEM LOSE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T RACE? NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, IS THERE ANY OF THAT LEFT?
NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND IS BASICALLY BROKEN. WE WANT CONGRESS TO FIX THAT BROKEN LAW. UNFORTUNATELY, CONGRESS IS PRETTY BROKEN AND SO WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH STATES. HAVE A HIGH BAR, COLLEGE AND CAREER STANDARDS FOR EVERY CHILD AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A LOT MORE ROOM TO BE CREATIVE. THE BEST IDEAS IN EDUCATION FRANKLY DON'T COME FROM ME. THEY DON'T COME FROM ANYONE ELSE IN WASHINGTON. THEY COME FROM LOCAL TEACHERS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STATES AND WHAT THEY'RE ADDING TO THIS MIX. IN 2010, THE STATES GOT TOGETHER AND CREATED SOMETHING CALLED THE COMMON CORE.
THEY RAISED STANDARD.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND THERE WILL BE EMPHASIS ON THINGS LIKE READING LITERATURE, LIKE READING "TREASURE ISLAND" AND LEARNING TO READ MANUALS, MORE MEMOS.
THAT'S WHAT I --
Stephen:  I'VE BEEN TOLD. IS THAT TRUE?
YOU WANT CHILDREN READING EVERYTHING. YOU WANT LITERATURE AND YOU WANT THEM READING THE CONSTITUTION, YOU WANT PLAYS AND POETRY.
Stephen:  AND INSTRUCTION MANUALS? AND INSTRUCTION MANUALS? IS THAT PART OF IT? BECAUSE I READ INSTRUCTION MANUALS AND MEMOS. IS THAT TRUE? IF SO, WHEN CAN I GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL? IS THAT PART TRUE?
A MEMO HERE AND THERE WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THAT WAS, LIKE, PULLING TEETH WITHOUT AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL OKAY, I'VE HEARD THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO GET RID OF PRINTED TEXTBOOKS AND GO TO ALL DIGITAL. IS THAT TRUE?
I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE FROM PRINT TO DIGITAL AS FAST AS WE CAN. WE SPEND EACH YEAR-- EVERY SCHOOL IS UNDERFUND. EACH YEAR WE SPEND $7 TO $9 BILLION ON TEXTBOOKS WHICH THEY ARE OBSOLETE WHEN YOU BUY THEM.
Stephen:  WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME GETTING STUFFED INTO MY LOCK OR A DAILY BASIS WAS THAT IT WAS FULL OF BOOKS. HOW AM I GOING TO-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU WANT TO LIGHTEN THOSE BACKPACKS. THEY'RE FAR TOO HEAVY. AND ALL THAT STEERS MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON TEXTBOOKS, PUT IT INTO DIGITAL, INTO RESOURCES STUDENTS CAN USE RIGHT NOW.
Stephen:  HE PUSHED FOR FOUR-YEAR-OLDS, A NATIONAL PROGRAM WHERE ALL FOUR-YEAR-OLDS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen:  WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE OUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM US? ( LAUGHTER ) THEY ARE AT THEIR MOST ADORABLE. AND HOW DO YOU PAY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? THAT'S AN ENORMOUS, ENORMOUS PRICE TAG.
IT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE. LONGITUDINAL STUDIES, 7-TO-1 RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH-QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, LESS CRIME, LESS TEENAGED PREGNANCY, MORE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES, MORE FOLKS GOING TO COLLEGE, MOST FOLKS ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. IT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE.
Stephen:  I WANT TO DO THE MATH HERE. FIINVEST IN ONE PRE-KINDERGARTNER, I GET SEVEN OF THEM WHEN THEY GRADUATE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen:  I'M IN. ARNE DUNCAN, U.S. SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
