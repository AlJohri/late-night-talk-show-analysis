Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE. SO NICE TO HAVE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE WITH YOU  HERE TONIGHT ON MY BIRTHDAY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE�i ). WOW. BLIND ADULATION. IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.�r  AND, FOLKS, WHEN I WOKE UP THIS  MORNING, THERE WAS ANOTHER FANTASTIC GIFT UNDERNEATH MY  BIRTHDAY TREE. AND, YES, I HAVE A BIRTHDAY  TREE. WHY SHOULD JESUS BE THE ONLY  ONE? AND THIS MORNING I UNWRAPPED A  BEAUTIFUL BOX OF CRIPPLING  SCANDAL FOR THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION. FIRST UP, BENGHAZI. HOW BAD IS IT, FOLKS? NATION, YOU BETTER SIT DOWN AND  BUCKLE UP BECAUSE YOU SHOULD NOT  BE STANDING WHILE WATCHING TV IN THE CAR. NOW, EVERYONE KNOWS THIS WAS AN  UNQUESTIONABLE TRAGEDY WHERE  FOUR AMERICANS LOST THEIR LIVES IN WHAT WE NOW KNOW WERE VICIOUS  TERRORIST ATTACKS. BUT LISTEN TO HOW OBAMA  CALLOUSLY DESCRIBED THEM THE  NEXT DAY.
NO ACTS OF TERROR WILL EVER  SHAKE THE RESOLVE OF THIS GREAT  NATION.
Stephen: WHAT? ACTS OF TERROR? THEY WERE TERRORIST ATTACKS. AM I THE�� ONLY ONE WH7D FEELS THIS��  WAY? DARELL ISSA.
AN ACT OF TERROR IS DIFFERENT  THAN TERRORIST ATTACK.
Stephen: YES.�  THEY'RE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. YOU SAY POTATO, I SAY WHAT DO  THE PO-TAH-TOE KNOW AND WHEN DID  HE KNOW IT? NOW THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE  BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS STORY  FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS HAVE BEEN ME AND FOX NEWS. BUT FROM THE REST OF TELEVISION  AND RADIO, SILENCE. JIM?
ACROSS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA  IT WAS A COLLECTIVE YAWN IN  RESPONSE TO YESTERDAY'S BENGHAZI  COVERAGE.
WHY ARE THE MEDIA IGNORING  NEW DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED  THE NIGHT OF THE BENGHAZI  ATTACK?
THE MEDIA IS REALLY PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S SCANDAL CONDOM. NO MATTER HOW ROUGH THINGS GET,  NOTHING GETS THROUGH.
Stephen: GREG'S RIGHT. THE MEDIA IS OBAMA'S SCANDAL  CONDOM AND NO MATTER HOW ROUGH  FOX NEWS SLAMS THIS STORY TO THE HILT, THEY STILL HAVE REAL  TROUBLE INFECTING AMERICA WITH  THEIR NEWS HERPES. BUT ACTS OF TERROR, TERRORIST  ATTACK, IS THAT REALLY THE  SCANDAL HERE? NO. THAT'S JUST SEMANTICS. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT THE WORDS  PEOPLE USED.�r  LET ME SET THE STAGE, FOLKS. THIS ATTACK CAME TWO MONTHS  BEFORE THE ELECTION. AND OBAMA COULD NOT HAVE AN AL  QAEDA ATTACK ON HIS WATCH WHEN  HE'S THE ONE WHO PERSONALLY STRANGLED BIN LADEN WITH ONE OF  HIS SHOE LACES. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HE�� CLAIMS. SO TALKING POINTS WERE GENERATED  BY WHO KNOWS THAT DID NOT  MENTION AL QAEDA. WHO SCRUBBED THE MEMOS? WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JAY  CARNEY, DANCE FOR YOUR SUPPERWi�i
THE WHITE HOUSE AND STATE  DEPARTMENT HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT�r���r  THE SINGLE ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS MADE TO THOSE�r TALKING POINTS BY�r�i  EITHER OF THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS  WERE CHANGING THE WORD "CONSULATE" TO "DIPLOMATIC��  FACILITY."
Stephen: WOW. CONSULATE�� TO DIPLOMATIC  FACILITY. WOW, THEY REALLY HAVE A WAY WITH  THE LANGUAGE EWEN IS. SO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE STATE  DEPARTMENT JUST CHANGED ONE  WORD. HMMMM. LET ME JUST CHANGE ONE WORD. LIAR. JIM?
TODAY ABC NEWS HAS  EXCLUSIVELY OBTAINED 12 VERSIONS  OF THE TALKING POINTS SHOWING THEY WENT THROUGH EXTENSIVE  EDITS. THE EARLY DRAFTS POINTED TO  EVIDENCE THAT AN AL QAEDA A FILL  RATED GROUP TOOK PART IN THE ATTACK AND THAT THE C.I.A. HAD  WARNED ABOUT AL QAEDA THREATS IN  BENGHAZI.
THE TALKING POINTSHAM�i  UNDERGONE 12 DIFFERENT REVISIONS  INCLUDING EXTENSIVE EDITS BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
12 CRAFTS. THAT'S WORSE THAN A COVER-UP  FOLKS. THAT'S OVERTHINKING.�i  YOU HAVE TO WRITE FROM THE  HEART. AND THE REASON THESE TALKING  POINTS ARE SO IMPORTANT IS THAT  THEY TAKE US BACK TO THE MOMENT THIS COVER-UP STARTED. WHEN U.N. AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE  WENT ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS TO  SAY THE ATTACKS WERE SPONTANEOUSLY INSPIRED BY THE  PROTESTS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY IN  CAIRO WHICH WERE OVER AN OFFENSIVE YOU-TUBE VIDEO ABOUT  MOHAMMED BUT THANKS TO JONATHAN  CARL WE NOW KNOW THAT THE ORIGINAL C.I.A. MEMO SAID THEIR  BEST GUESS WAS THAT THE ATTACKS  WEr� SPONTANEOUSLY INSPIRED BY THE PROTESTS AT THE U.S. EMBASSY  IN CAIRO AS DID EVERY OTHER  VERSION OF THE MEMO. THAT DOES NOT HELP MY ARGUMENT. SO FORGET THAT PART. JUST REMEMBER THIS. THEY TOOK OUT ANY MENTION OF AL  QAEDA AND REMOVED ALL THE C.I.A. WARNINGS OF IMMINENT THREAT. BOTTOM LINE. SUSAN RICE WENT ON THE SUNDAY  SHOWS AND, FOR POLITICAL  REASONS, WAS NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE  MIDDLE EAST. YOU WOULD NEVER SEE A REPUBLICAN  DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. FOLKS, BENGHAZI ISN'T EVEN THE  BEST. I MEAN, WORST SCANDAL TO HIT THE  ADMINISTRATION TODAY.
THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO HAD TO  RESPOND TODAY TO ANOTHER FIRE  STORM. THE ADMISSION BY THE I.R.S. THAT  IT GAVE EXTRA SCRUTINY TO  ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE WORDS, QUOTE, TEA PARTY OR, QUOTE,  PATRIOT IN THEIR TITLES WHEN  THEY WERE APPLYING FOR TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
AS EARLY AS MARCH 2010 THE  CINCINATTI FIELD OFFICE WHICH  WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR TAX-EXEMPT  STATUS BEGAN SEARCHING FOR  GROUPS WITH POLITICALLY  IDENTIFIABLE NAMES. ACCORDING TO�� THE "WASHINGTON  POST" OF THE 298 GROUPS SELECTED  FOR SPECIAL SCRUTINY 72 HAD THE WORDS "TEA PARTY" IN THEIR TITLE
Stephen: THE I.R.S. OWES AN  APOLOGY TO EVERY TEA PARTY GROUP  IN AMERICA INCLUDING SUZY JOHNSON AND HER EIGHT STUFFED  ANIMALS. FOLKS, OH, THEY'RE COMING FOR  HER. FOLKS, THIS IS A NEW LOW FOR THE  I.R.S. WHAT'S NEXT? MAKING G.E. PAY TAXES? FOLKS, THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO  DESCRIBE A SCANDAL THIS HOT.
THIS SHOULD SEND A CHILL UP  YOUR SPINE.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CHILLING  THAT THE I.R.S. WAS SINGLING OUT  CONSERVATIVE GROUPS FOR EXTRA  REVIEW.
THE A.C.L.U. IS TALKING ABOUT  HOW CHILLING THIS IS.
THIS IS CHILLING. Stephen: IT'S CHILLING WHICH  ALSO DESCRIBES THE CHAMPAGNE  I'VE BEEN WAITING TO BREAK OUT FOR JUST THIS SCANDAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BECAUSE... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, THIS PROVES THAT  EVERYTHING I'VE EVER SAID ABOUT  OBAMA IS TRUE. SO IT'S OFFICIAL. HE'S A SECRET MUSLIM,  SHAPE-SHIFTING ALIEN FROM KENYA  WHO IS COMING FOR OUR GUNS AND BO IS A MEMBER OF THE  ILLUMINATI. FOLKS, OF COURSE, THE BIGGEST  VICTIM HERE, I'M SAD TO PROUDLY  SAY, IS ME. YOU SEE, THE TAX EXEMPTIONS AT  ISSUE WERE FOR NONPROFIT GROUPS  KNOWN AS 501 C-4s LIKE CROSS ROADS G.P.S. LONG-TIME VIEWERS WILL REMEMBER  MY LOVE OF EXPLAINING THAT THESE  GROUPS DO NOT HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEIR DONORS AND ARE ALLOWED TO  TAKE PART IN POLITICAL  ACTIVITIES BUT THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE MUST TO BE PROCEED AT  THE TIME SOCIAL WELFARE. FOR EXAMPLE, KARL ROVE'S  CROSSROADS G.P.S. WORKS TO  PROMOTE SOCIAL WELFARE BY  CAMPAIGNING TO ELIMINATE  WELFARE. OF COURSE, THE MOST FAMOUS 501  C-4 OF ALL IS COLBERT SUPERPAC  S-H-H. YOU REMEMBER OUR MOTTO: MAKING A  BETTER TOMORROW, TOMORROW. WELL, THE I.R.S. MUST KNOW OUR  MOTTO TOO BECAUSE THEY WERE  CAUGHT SINGLING OUT 501 C-4 APPLICATIONS THAT INCLUDED  PHRASES LIKE "MAKE AMERICA A  BETTER PLACE TO LIVE."  I BET THEY ALSO SINGLED OUT ORGANIZATIONS THAT CLAIMED A HAM  AS A DEPENDENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
