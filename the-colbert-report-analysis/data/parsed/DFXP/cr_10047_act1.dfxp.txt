HEY, LOOK AT THAT. WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT CAME TO PASS, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. IT CAME TO PASS, THE PEOPLE CRIED OUT FOR FREEDOM AND IT WAS MY NAME. NATION, YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT AMERICA IS THE GREATEST, BEST COUNTRY GOD EVER GAVE MAN ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH. UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE LIKE A ROCK IT GIVES YOU WINGS, USA, NUMBER ONE. THIS IS WHY FRANKLY I'M DISGUSTED THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND USA TOURISM HAVE TEAMED UP TO BEG FOR THE WORLD'S APPROVAL IN THIS NEW AD ♪ LAND OF DREAM ♪ ♪ FREEDOM AND FIND YOUR LAND OF DREAMS ♪ ♪ COME AND FIND YOUR LAND OF DREAMS ♪ ♪.
MULTIRACIAL BAND, HINDU FESTIVALS, WHAT KIND OF AD FOR AMERICA IS THAT? WHERE ARE THE TODDLER PAGEANTS?  WHERE ARE THE GUNS? WHERE IS THE LAP BAND SURGERY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GREAT CAMPAIGN, OBAMA. WHEN I'M PUSHING MY WAY THROUGH TIMES SQUARE I ALWAYS THINK WHY CAN'T WE HAVE MORE DRUNK EURO TEENS TAKING PHOTOS WITH A CRUSTY BOOTLEG ELMO? BESIDES, AMERICA DOES NOT NEED A COMMERCIAL. IT MAKES US SEEM DESPERATE LIKE JAMAICA OR THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SANDALS. AND IF YOU ARE'S GOING TO MAKE A TOURISM AD IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS. AMERICA, COME OR DON'T. WE DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I HAVEN'T EVEN SHOWN YOU THE WORST PART OF THE PATHETIC GOVERNMENT BEGFEST. ♪  LAND OF DREAMS♪ ♪ COME FIND YOUR LAND OF DREAMS ♪
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, JIM, FREEZE IT RIGHT THERE. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. DID THEY REALLY HAVE TO REVEAL TO THE WORLD THAT EVERYONE IN AMERICA PARAGLIDES WHILE AN EAGLE LANDS ON THEIR ARM? THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SECRET. NOW EVERY TOMAS, DOLF AND JORGE ARE GOING TO WANT IN. THE LINES AT EAGLE ARM CANYON ARE GOING TO BE INSANE. (LAUGHTER) I JUST KNOW THE NEXT TIME I GO PARAHAWKING WHICH IS TONIGHT, BY THE WAY, ALL THE GOOD BIRDS WILL BE TAKEN, I'LL BE STUCK WITH A CHICKEN.
WELL, WELL I GUESS-- AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T BLOW THE COVER ON OUR OTHER NATIONAL PAST TIME, WHITEWATER RAFTING WHILE SPOONING A JAGUAR. WELL, FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, I DEDICATED ALL OF LAST NIGHT'S SHOW EXCLUSIVELY TO SPORTS. BUT THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, FOLKS, I AM A HUGE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, FOLKS, I AM A HUGE FAN OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL. IT'S GOT ALL THE GRACE AND ATHLETICISM OF PRO FOOTBALL BUT THE PLAYERS DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY. THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF NOT GETTING PAID. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN JADED PROFESSIONAL WHO DO THINGS FOR MONEY. SAME REASON I JUST DON'T ENJOY WATCHING PEOPLE PICK COTTON ANY MORE. BUT A TERRIFYING, TERRIFYING NEW ENEMY IS THREATENING TO DESTROY OUR BELOVED COLLEGE SPORTS. EDUCATION.
THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA IS NOT JUST AN  ATHLETIC POWERHOUSE WITH DEDICATED FANS. IT'S ALSO A TOP TIER ACADEMIC INSTITUTION. BUT ONE ACADEMIC COUNSELOR THERE WHO SPENT YEARS TUTORING STUDENT ATHLETES SAYS TOO MANY OF THEM CAN'T EVEN READ.
THEY'RE LEAVING HERE, WITHOUT AN EDUCATION.
WILLINGHAM FOUND THAT 8% WERE READING BELOW A FOURTH GRADE LEVEL AND 60% WERE READING BETWEEN A 4th AND 8th GRADE READING LEVEL.
WE MAY AS WELL JUST GO OVER TO GLENWOOD ELEMENTARY RIGHT OFF THE STREET AND JUST LET ALL THE FOURTH GRADERS COME HERE.
Stephen: WHY, HOW FAST CAN THEY RUN THE 40? (LAUGHTER) CAN THEY REALLY TAKE A HIT? OKAY. WORSE, FOLKS, THIS COUNSELOR WILLINGHAM HERE CLAIMS THEY'RE RIPPING OUR STUDENT ATHLETES OFF.
THE SCHOLARSHIP AGREEMENT IS OFTEN FRAUDULENT. WE PROMISE AN EDUCATION IN EXCHANGE FOR TALENT. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE PROVIDING FOR MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE.
Stephen: FRAUDULENT, COME ON. UNC IS FULFILLING ITS END OF THE BARGAIN. YOU PLAY FOOTBALL AND IN EXCHANGE YOU GET A DIPLOMA  YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IS WHAT IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T READ IT BUT TRUST THEM IT SAYS THAT YOU CAN. AND THIS WHOLE WE OWE STUDENTS AN EDUCATION RACKET IS A THREAT TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN KIDS' FUTURES: PRESENT-DAY MONEY. BECAUSE COLLEGE SPORTS IS AN $8 BILLION INDUSTRY ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF THE NFL. AND IF COLLEGE ATHLETES LEARN MATH THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CALCULATE THAT THEIR SHARE OF THAT MONEY IS 0%. AND THEY'RE BIG BOYS. BESIDES, KNOWLEDGE IS A PRECIOUS THING. IT'S A WASTE TO STUFF IT INTO A FOOTBALL PLAYER'S SKULL WHEN IT IS JUST GOING TO GET ALL SCRAMBLED OUT ON THE FIELD. NOW SPEAKING OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL, FOLKS, PRO FOOTBALL, IT'S THE NFL PLAY-OFFS EVERYONE IS BRINGING THEIR A GAME. THE FAST GUYS WHO DO THE CATCH BALL, THE HUGE FELLAS WHO PUSH THE SMALLER GUYS AND THE STRIPEY DANCERS WHO DO THE YMCA. NICE TO SEE THEY MADE THE PLAY-OFFS AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND AS ALWAYS, WE'RE SEEING SOME OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES FROM THE TRUE HEROES OF THE NFL, THE ADVERTISERS.
TRUE FANS KNOW ALL THE PLAYERS. PEPSI IS THE OFFICIAL SOFT DRINK OF THE NFL. GATORADE THE OFFICIAL SPORTS DRINK, X BOX ONE IS THE OFFICIAL CONSOLE OF THE NFL, BRIDGESTONE IS THE OFFICIAL TIRE OF THE NFL AND EARLIER THIS YEAR, SABRA HUMMUS BECAME THE OFFICIAL DIP OF THE NFL. YEAH. IT'S PRETTY EXCITING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S PRETTY EXCITING. THEY'RE ALREADY GRINDING THE CHICK PEAS FOR THE CELEBRATORY HUMMUS DUMP. FOLKS, THERE IS A REASON THE NFL TAKES ITS CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS SO SERIOUSLY. IN FACT, THERE ARE 1.2 BILLION REASONS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO MAKE BUD LIGHT THE NFL'S OFFICIAL BEER WHICH IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY FAIR PRICE FOR OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZING BUD LITE AS A BEER. (APPLAUSE) I LOVE THIS SPONSORSHIP. FOLKS, I LOVE THIS PARTNERSHIP AND SO DOES ONE OF THE GAME'S BIGGEST STARS BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT BRONCOS QUARTERBACK PEYTON MANNING SAID AFTER HIS TEAM'S WIN ON SUNDAY.
WHAT IS ON MY MIND IS HOW SOON I CAN GET A BUD LITE IN MY MOUTH AFTER THIS WIN, THAT IS REALLY PRIORITY NUMBER ONE.
FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS JUST MIGHT BE THE GREATEST ACT OF SPORTS ADJACENT CORPORATE PROMOTION SINCE LOU GEHRIG'S TEARFUL FAREWELL.
TODAY I CONSIDER MYSELF THE LUCKIEST MAN ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO BRILL CREAM, A LITTLE DAB WILL DO YOU.
PAYTON MANNING YOU KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. REMEMBER, AS THE GREAT VINCE LOMBARDI ONCE SAID WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING,-- ♪ BA DA BA BA BA, I'M LOVING IT. ♪ WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
