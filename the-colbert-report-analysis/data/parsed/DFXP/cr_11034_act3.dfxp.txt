Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN THE FILM ADAPTATION OF "INTO THE WOODS," AS "THE BAKER." I HOPE THERE'S SOME HARD-CORE FROSTING. PLEASE WELCOME JAMES CORDEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ HEY, JAMES! GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
NICE TO HAVE YOU ON! I'M A BIG FAN!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: YOU ARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW A TONY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR, WRITER, COMEDIAN, YOU CO-CREATED AND STARRED IN GAVIN & STACEY ON THE BBC WHICH IS A GREAT SHOW. AND ON BROADWAY IN "ONE MAN, TWO GOVERNORS" WHICH I SAW AND WAS JUST INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
Stephen: AND NOW THE BIG NEWS THAT PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW IS IS THAT YOU'RE TAKING OVER THE "LATE LATE SHOW" ON CBS STARTING IN MARCH.
THIS IS TRUE.
Stephen: WOW! INCREDIBLE. GOOD FOR YOU, MAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: I HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH, FOLLOWING DAVID LETTERMAN, THAT MUST BE INTIMIDATING.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU MUST HAVE SOME BALLS! LUCKILY I'M AN HOUR LATER. SO GOD HELP THAT GUY.
Stephen: YEAH. PEOPLE ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IT THE NETWORK.
Stephen: YEAH. I DO 160 SHOWS A YEAR. HOW MANY SHOWS HAVE YOU DONE ON TELEVISION?
ABOUT EIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S THE BBC MODEL. YOU HAVE EIGHT AND THREE YEARS TO DO THEM, RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINISHED BEFORE I START. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IF I COULD GET YOU ADVICE, GET SLEEP NOW.
OKAY.
Stephen: BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SHOW FOR NINE YEARS AND MY BODY HAS STARTED BURNING MY TEETH FOR FUEL. ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A GOOD TIME.
WELL I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT  Stephen: WHEN DOES IT START?
IT STARTS IN MARCH. IT WILL BE EVERY NIGHT OF THE WEEK.
Stephen: YEAH! IT'S GOING TO BE FANTASTIC!
IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER, LET'S BE CLEAR.
Stephen: NO, HERE'S WHAT YOU WILL LIKE ABOUT IT. I'M GETTING OUT OF THE GAME, BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE ABOUT IT IS IF YOU THINK OF SOMETHING THAT DAY YOU GET TO SEE WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT THAT NIGHT.
I REALLY LOVE A DAY THAT WORKS TO A POINT
WHEN I WAS IN THE PLAY ONE MAN, TWO GOVERNORS,  I REALLY ENJOYED A DAY THAT'S GOT A FOCUS WHERE YOU'RE WORKING TO 7:30, THE AUDIENCE, THE GUYS SELLING THE TICKETS, THE PEOPLE, THE CREW, AND WHEN IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE. YOU CAN'T CELEBRATE YOUR HITS OR WORRY ABOUT YOUR MISSES, THERE IS ANOTHER SHOW THE NEXT DAY AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SORT OF CONSISTENCY.
Stephen:  NOW YOU'RE MORE THAN JUST A CHAT SHOW HOST YOU'RE ALSO AN ACCOMPLISHED  ACTOR. YOU HAVE A SERIOUS MAJOR MOVIE "INTO THE WOODS."
YES. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DID YOU ALWAYS LIKE SONDHEIM?
I THINK HE'S THE GREATEST LIVING COMPOSER AND LYRICIST IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: HE'S OUR SHAKESPEARE.
I THINK HE'S INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: HE'S OUR SHAKESPEARE. HE'S AN AMERICAN. YOUR SHAKESPEARE HAS BEEN DEAD A LONG TIME. WE HAVE A LIVING SHAKESPEARE.
YEAH. WELL WE HAVE ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER WHO IS NOT AS GOOD
Stephen: VERY GOOD. HE'S VERY GOOD
Stephen: YOU'RE DOING IT WITH SOME SERIOUS PEOPLE, TOO.
YEAH.
Stephen: JOHNNY DEPP'S IN THERE, MERYL STREEP'S IN THAT. MERYL STREEP --
YEAH.
Stephen: MY GOD, WHAT'S IT LIKE TO ACT WITH MERYL STREEP? THAT MUST BE INTIMIDATING. WHAT'S IT LIKE?
IT'S TERRIFYING. IT'S A CONSTANT FEELING OF TRYING TO THINK ITS VERY ORDINARY THAT YOU MIGHT JUST BE ACTING WITH MERYL STREEP. IT'S A BIT HOW I AM RIGHT NOW, I'M SITTING HERE PRETENDING THIS IS AN ORDINARY THING TO DO WHERE, INSIDE, I'M, LIKE,  OH, MY GOD! I'M ON "THE COLBERT REPORT"! THIS IS AMAZING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WHEN YOUR SHOW STARTS, I HAVE FREE TIME WHEN THIS THING IS OVER, CAN I COME ON YOUR SHOW?
I WOULD LOVE YOU TO COME. IT WOULD BE AMAZING. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR LOVE OF SINGING. HOW DID THAT START? HAVE YOU BEEN A SINGER A LONG TIME?
THE FIRST MUSICAL I DID WHEN I WAS 17,  A MUSICAL ON THE WEST END CALLED MARTIN GUERRE, WRITTEN BY SCHONBERG AND BOUBLIL WHO WROTE LES MIS AND MISS SAIGON
Stephen: WAS THAT BASED ON THE MOVIE?
RIGHT BUT IT WAS A TERRIBLE SHOW, A DISASTER. BUT I'VE ALWAYS LOVED MUSICALS.
Stephen: I SING A LITTLE. I'VE WORKED WITH MR. SONDHEIM. HE'S A FRIEND. AND HE ACTUALLY SENT ME A LETTER SAYING I HAVE A PERFECT VOICE FOR MUSICAL THEATER. A LETTER, I HAD IT NOTARIZED. HE LEGALLY CAN'T TAKE IT BACK EVEN AFTER HE HEARD ME SING.
THAT'S AMAZING. >>Stephen: WE SING ON THE SHOW SOMETIMES. DO YOU WANT TO  DO A LITTLE SONG TOGETHER? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OK
Stephen: LET'S SO A CHRISTMAS CAROL. WHAT DO YOU LIKE?
HAVE YOUR SELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: WE KNOW THAT ONE HERE ON THIS SIDE OF THE POND  ♪ HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS ♪ ♪ MAY YOUR HEART BE LIGHT  ♪ FROM NOW ON OUR TROUBLES WILL BE OUT OF SIGHT ♪ ♪ THROUGH THE YEARS WE ALL MAY BE TOGETHER ♪ ♪ IF THE FATES ALLOW  ♪ HANG A SHINING STAR UPON THE HIGHEST BOUGH ♪ ♪ AND HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS... NOW ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: JAMES CORDEN, "INTO THE WOODS," AND THE LATE LATE SHOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
