Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNEW IT, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU POSSIBLY KNEW IT, BUT THAT IS MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS CAROL. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE BECAUSE THANKS TO THE GOVERNMENT BEING UNABLE TO AGREE ON A RESOLUTION TO FUND ITSELF, THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHUT DOWN AT MIDNIGHT. JIMMY? PUT UP THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. NEVER LEARNED SOMEHOW-TO-SET THAT THING. HOLD DOWN ONE OF THESE BUTTONS AND I PUSH THAT. I'VE GOT TO CALL MY NEPHEW, HAVE HIM COME OVER. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, TRUST ME, WE ARE COUNTING DOWN TONIGHT. JUST LOOK ALL OVER CABLE NEWS. ALL THE NUMBERS ARE GETTING SMALLER! FOX NEWS HAS ONE; MSNBC HAS ONE; CNN IS COUNTING DOWN-- THOUGH THAT MIGHT JUST BE THE NUMBER OF THEIR REMAINING VIEWERS. (LAUGHTER) I ONLY WISH THAT RONNIE REAGAN WERE ALIVE TO SEE THIS LOOMING SHUTDOWN BECAUSE WHO CAN FORGET WHAT HE SAID.
THE NINE MOST TERRIFYING WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARE: I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WELL, GOOD NEWS. GOOD NEWS, RONNIE, BECAUSE COME MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THOSE NINE WORDS WILL BE: I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I WILL WORK FOR FOOD. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND TONIGHT -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND, FOLKS, TONIGHT I WILL BE COVERING THE END OF GOVERNMENT IN A MUST-SEE TELEVISION EVENT: THE FINALE OF "BREAKING GOV." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) YES, TONIGHT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ENDS! OH, IT HAS BEEN A HELL OF A RIDE, FOLKS. WHAT A DRAMATIC ARC! IT STARTED OUT AS A HIGHLY SYMPATHETIC CHARACTER IN THE 1770s, BUT IN JUST 237 SEASONS, IT HAS TRANSFORMED INTO AN EGOTISTICAL SELF-DESTRUCTIVE MANIAC. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I AM DYING TO KNOW WHAT GOES DOWN TONIGHT. I MEAN, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO MR. WHITE? MR. WHITE? MR. OFF WHITE AND PINKMAN. WELL, ORANGEMAN. (LAUGHTER) THE BEST PART ABOUT THE FINALE OF "BREAKING GOV" IS THAT THE BAD GUYS ARE ALL GETTING ELIMINATED-- THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL, NASA, WHICH IS SLATED TO FURLOUGH 97% OF ITS EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SNEAK PEEK OF NASA'S FINAL SCENE. (LAUGHTER) AND THE GOVERNMENT HADN'T EVEN SHUT DOWN YET, BUT THE REVIEWS ARE ALREADY IN. MICHELE BACHMANN RAVES: "WE'RE VERY EXCITED. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED AND WE GOT IT." AND CALIFORNIA REP DEVON NUNEZ SAYS CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ARE "ALL GIDDY ABOUT IT." OF COURSE THEY'RE GIDDY. THEY WILL STILL GET PAID IN THE EVENT OF A SHUTDOWN. (BOOS) OF COURSE -- YEAH, THAT'S ONE OF THE DRAMATIC TURNS. NO ONE SAW THAT COMING. OF COURSE -- I KNOW, FULL OF SURPRISES. ALL OF THIS ASSUMES THERE IS NOT A DEAL IN THE NEXT 25 MINUTES. SO, JIM, LET'S CHECK IN ON THE NEGOTIATIONS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S -- I GOTTA SAY, FOLKS, THAT IS GOING WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT. (LAUGHTER) NOW, NATION, I THINK OF MYSELF AS AN OBJECTIVE OBSERVER BECAUSE I OBJECT TO EVERYTHING I OBSERVE. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT; WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF! (LAUGHTER) NATION, IT'S LATE SEPTEMBER, WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME TO GEAR UP FOR THANKSGIVING. I LOVE IT ALL: THE FOOD, THE FAMILY, THE LAUGHING, THE DRINKING, THE "NO WONDER YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU, MARGARET," THE "THAT'S NOT THE PROPER WORD FOR ASIANS, NANA." THE "EVERYBODY HELP CLEAN UP, MOM LOCKED HERSELF IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM WITH A BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY." IT'S A SPECIAL TIME AND NO THANKSGIVING IS COMPLETE WITHOUT BUTTERBALL TURKEYS. THEY'RE AN AMERICAN CLASSIC, JUST LIKE THAT PILGRIMS KEPT IN DARK CAGES THEIR ENTIRE LIVES UP TO THEIR ANKLES IN THEIR OWN FECES. PASS ME ANOTHER DRUMSTICK. AND THEIR LATEST ANNOUNCEMENT MADE ME EVEN MORE OF A TRYPTOPHAN. (LAUGHTER)
THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK LINE IS LOOKING FAR FEW GOOD MEN. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TURKEY SELLER IS LOOKING TO HIRE MALE OPERATORS TO HELP GIVE ADVICE TO ANYONE TRYING TO MAKE THE PERFECT TURKEY DURING THE HOLIDAYS. FOR THE PAST 32 YEARS, ONLY WOMEN HAVE OFFERED ADVICE ON THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK LINE.
Stephen: FINALLY MEN ON THE TURKEY TALK LINE! I MEAN -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME THE MEN WERE ON THE TURKEY TALK LINE-- BESIDES THE ONES AT THE N.S.A. (LAUGHTER) SO A BIG TIP OF THE HAT TO BUTTERBALL FOR RECOGNIZING THAT MEN HAVE THE RIGHT STUFFING. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, AS BUTTERBALL SAYS "MORE AND MORE MEN ARE INVOLVED IN THANKSGIVING DINNER AND TODAY ONE IN EVERY FOUR CALLS ARE FROM MEN." BUTTERBALL KNOWS WHEN A GUY CALLS ANYONE, HE WANTS ANOTHER MAN ON THE LINE! (LAUGHTER) JUST LIKE PHONE SEX. MEN KNOW WHAT MEN LIKE. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE MEN WILL GIVE MEN MANLY COOKING TIPS LIKE "BUY TURKEY, LAY ON COUCH UNTIL SHARON SAYS IT'S TIME TO CARVE THE BIRD, SERVE AND EAT, RETURN TO COUCH." CLASSIC RECIPE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO GOOD FOR YOU, BUTTERBALL, FOR PUTTING SOME MAN GRAVY ON THIS YEAR'S BIRD. (AUDIENCE REACTS) THE BUTTERBALL IS GOOD, BUTTERBALLS ARE BETTER. (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM HYPERCOMPETITIVE AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT BY NOW-- WELL, THEN I GIVE UP. (LAUGHTER) SO I AM GIVING A WAG OF THE FINGER TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SCIENCE WRITER ASHLEY MERRYMAN FOR AN OP-ED SHE WROTE LAST WEEK ENTITLED "LOSING IS GOOD FOR YOU." WELL, IF YOU REALLY FEEL THAT WAY, MS. MERRYMAN, GREAT NEWS, I THINK YOU'RE A LOSER. (LAUGHTER) MERRYMAN HERE CLAIMS AMERICA HAS GONE TROPHY CRAZY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR KIDS AND THAT AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCHING THE EFFECTS OF PRAISE ON KIDS "THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR: AWARDS CAN BE POWERFUL MOTIVATORS BUT NON-STEP RECOGNITION DOES NOT INSPIRE CHILDREN TO SUCCEED, INSTEAD IT CAN CAUSE THEM TO UNDERACHIEVE." WRONG! (LAUGHTER) WRONG! THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON AWARDS. WHAT DO YOU THINK GAVE WASHINGTON THE CONFIDENCE TO DEFEAT THE BRITISH? IT WAS HIS FOURTH GRADE MOST IMPROVED KARATE PARTICIPATION PROFY! (LAUGHTER) LISTEN UP! LISTEN UP, THE "NEW YORK TIMES." I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. YOU PUBLISHED SOME LIBERAL J.D. ABOUT AWARDS BEING TERRIBLE AND LOSING THE S THE BEST RIGHT AFTER I WIN THESE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SKRAO +ED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CLEARLY, CLEARLY, CLEARLY SOMEBODY IS JEALOUS. BECAUSE WHILE I'VE BEEN SHOWERED IN GOLD, THE ONLY GOLDEN SHOWER THE "NEW YORK TIMES" GETS IS CONGRESS TEAL URINE. (LAUGHTER) FINALLY, FOLKS, EVERYONE KNOWS I'M CLOSE TO THE JESUS. HE CARRIES ME ON THAT BEAT SO OFTEN HE GOT A BABY BJORN. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO SCIENCE FOR SLANDERING MY RELIGION.
THE INSTITUTE OF APPLIED IMMUNOLOGY SHOWED ONE OF THE WORST CONTAMINATED WATER SOURCES ON THE PLANET IS IN CHURCHES. 86% OF HOLY WATER CONTAINS FECAL MATTER. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THEY'RE ALWAYS BURNING INCENSE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN HOLY WATER WAS DANGEROUS. I MEAN, JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DRINK IT. (LAUGHTER) (SCREAMING) A MOMENT ON THE LIPS, AN ETERNITY OF NOT HAVING LIPS. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHAT IF THERE'S FECAL MATTER? LISTEN TO THE SO-CALLED SOLUTIONS.
THE RESEARCHERS SAY IF THE CHURCHES WOULD JUST ADD SALT AND REGULARLY CHANGE THE WATER PROBLEM COULD BE ELIMINATED.
Stephen: ADD SALT AND CHANGE THE WATER? WE'RE BLESSING OURSELVES, NOT MAKING LINGUINI. (LAUGHTER) YOU DO NOTES ME WITH THE ORIGINAL RECIPE. IT WORKS. TAKING THE FECAL MATTER OUT OF HOLY WATER WOULD BE LIKE TAKING THE FECAL MATTER OUT OF COCA-COLA. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S IN THERE, I'M JUST SAYING I'VE NEVER SEEN THE RECIPE AND IT IS DARK BROWN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
