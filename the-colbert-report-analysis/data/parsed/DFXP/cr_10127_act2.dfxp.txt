(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW THIS BUT WE LIVE IN A GOLDEN ERA OF DIGITAL TOYS. MY FAVORITE ARE FITNESS TRACKERS LIKE THE FITBIT, I GOT ONE RIGHT HERE, USES MOTION SENSORS TO RECORD ALL OF MY  EXERCISE. AND EVIDENTLY I DID NOT MOVE TODAY. (LAUGHTER) LAST WEEK, LAST WEEK I WANTED TO RUN A MARATHON SO I STRAPPED THIS BAD BOY TO A PAINT SHAKER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. FOR SOME REASON I'M STILL NOT LOSING WEIGHT G FIGURE. FOR THE MOST EXCITING PERSONAL INFO DEVICE IS CALLED VESSYL, A BRAND-NEW DIGITAL CUP THAT TRACKS AND IDENTIFIES ALL YOUR BEVERAGES.
LET'S JUST SAY I HAVE THIS SODA ON THE TABLE. AND THIS ONE IS AN ORANGE CRUSH. IF I WAS TO POUR MY SODA INTO THE VESSYL IT WOULD KNOW THAT IT IS ORANGE CRUSH. IT WOULD KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT 70 CALORIES AND THEN I WOULD DRINK IT.
Stephen: WAIT. (LAUGHTER) A DIGITAL CUP THAT CAN TELL ME WHAT'S IN THE CUP AND HOW MANY CALORIES AND ALLOW ME TO DRINK IT? (LAUGHTER) THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION WAS PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE ONLY ON THE CAN YOU JUST POURED IT OUT OF. (APPLAUSE) I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY-- THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE SO MANY TIMES WHEN VESSYL BEVERAGE IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGY WILL COME IN HANDY LIKE WHEN YOU ORDER A COKE BUT IT TASTES KIND OF LIKE A DIET COKE BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE. AND PERHAPS OTHER TIMES. AND VESSYL WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR DAILY RECOMMENDED ALLOWANCE OF SILICON VALLEY BUZZWORDS.
THE VESSYL AUTOMATICALLY KNOWS WHAT'S INSIDE AND CAN TRACK IN REALTIME THE CONTENTS OF THE BEVERAGE. IT TRACKS YOUR REALTIME HYDRATION NEEDS BUT THE MAIN GOAL IS TO HELP YOU MAKE HEALTHIER AND MORE INFORMED DECISIONS IN REALTIME.
Stephen: FINALLY, DECISIONS IN REALTIME. I'M SO TIRED OF MAKING UP MY MIND HOURS AFTER I'M DONE DOING WHAT I WILL HAVE DECIDED. AND THIS REALTIME WORKS QUICKLY. JUST WATCH AS THIS GUY POURS A BEER FROM A CAN INTO VESSYL WHICH CONFIRMS IT IS BEER. IT'S LIKE HE'S NOT EVEN DRINKING ALONE ANY MORE. (LAUGHTER) AND--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AND ACCORDING TO VESSYL'S CREATIVE DIRECTOR THAT CYLINDRICAL DESIGN WAS NO ACCIDENT.
WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, FUNCTIONAL, DURABLE AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT COULD LIVE COMFORTABLY ON TABLETOPS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. IT HOLDS LIQUIDS AND CAN SIT UPRIGHT ON A TABLE. I MEAN IS THERE ANY ASPECT OF BEING A CUP THIS CUP CAN'T DO? AND NO WONDER BECAUSE VESSYL IS THE CULMINATION OF 7 YEARS OF WORK. (LAUGHTER) SEVEN YEARS, OKAY. LET'S PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE. THAT IS LONGER THAN THE TIME BETWEEN JFK'S CALL TO PUT A MAN ON THE MOON AND THE APOLLO 11 LANDING. AND REMEMBER WHEN ARMSTRONG LANDED HIS CUP HAD NO IDEA HE WAS DRINKING TANG. (LAUGHTER) NOT THAT INSPIRING NOW, IS IT? NATION AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO VESSYL IS THAT IT WILL COST ALMOST $200 AND WON'T SHIP UNTIL EARLY 2015. EARLY 2015 AND THAT'S IN REALTIME. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE EVEN ONCE VESSYL DOES LAUNCH, IT STILL ONLY MONITORS YOUR BEVERAGE INTAKE. THAT'S ONLY HALF THE HYDRATION EQUATION. WHAT ABOUT TRACKING YOUR OUTPUT. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THE PRE-RELEASE IDEA LAUNCH OF MY NEW PRODUCT TOYLYT. IT'S THE FIRST-- THE FIRST CUTTING EDGE E-RECEPTACLE  CAPABLE OF HANDLING ALL YOUR 1.0 AND 2.0 DOWNLOADS IN REALTIME. (LAUGHTER) MOST IMPORTANTLY, TOYLET SYNCS WITH YOUR iPHONE IN THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR iPHONE WHILE YOU'RE SITTING ON IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
