(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK THAT BLOWS THE LID OFF INCOME INEQUALITY. BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S 40 BUCKS, POOR PEOPLE WILL NEVER KNOW. PLEASE WELCOME THOMAS PIKETTY. HEY, MR. PIKETTY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. MONSUIER PIKETTY, BIENVENUE. JESUIS COLBERT. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE KING MAYOR OF ECONOMICS RIGHT NOW. YOU GOT THIS NEW BOOK CALLED CAPITAL IN THE 21st CENTURY. WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO TEAR DOWN THE WESTERN ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND REPLACE IT WITH SOCIALIST REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH?
I'M NOT TRYING TO DO THAT.
YOUR ACCENT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, I TURNED 18 WHEN THE BERLIN WALL FELL, SO I HAVE NEVER HAD AN INTEREST IN COMMUNISM. I AM JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT  EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM GLOBALIZATION.
BENEFITS HOW, LIKE TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE IT TO A POOR PERSON.
NO, NO. (LAUGHTER)
HOW DO WE BENEFIT EVERYBODY.
WE WANT ALL TO HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION, GOOD PAYING JOBS. RIGHT NOW THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THIS COUNTRY IS LOWER THAN IT WAS IN THE 60s. WHICH IS HALF A CENTURY AGO AND MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE BEST WE CAN DO. I'M NOT SAYING YOU CAN MULTIPLY IT BY THREE BUT HALF A CENTURY IS A BIT LONG FOR STAGNATION
MAYBE WE SHOULD INSTEAD OF TRIPLE IT MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST DOUBLE IT AND WORK 30 HOUR WORKWEEKS LIKE THEY DO OVER IN PARIS, RIGHT, THEN THE FARMERS CAN BRING THEIR TRACTORS IN AND STOP THE TRAFFIC AND WE'LL ALL TAKE TWO MONTHS OFF IN THE SUMMERTIME AND HAVE MISTRESSES MAYBE THAT'S--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, YET IN EUROPE, MANY BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF CIVILIZATION  IS TO WORK LESS, HAVE MORE VACATION AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY BUT YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE AND THAT'S FINE.
YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE AND BE A WORLD SUPERPOWER, OKAY. UNITED STATES SITTING ON TOP OF THE PILE HERE. DON'T WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM BENEFIT US AND MAYBE NOT THE REST OF THE WORLD.
SURE, AS LONG AS IT BENEFITS YOU.
BENEFITS ME. BENEFITS ME.
I WAS TALKING OF THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL.
I AM AMERICA.
GO AHEAD. SO HOW IS-- LET'S TALK ABOUT R IS GREATER THAN G. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT SAY MEMBERS MOVE MY AUDIENCE, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN,  WHAT DOES R IS GREATER THAN G HOW DOES THAT AFFECT OUR LIVES.
IF YOUR WAGE IS STAGNATING T MEANS THAT YOUR G IS CLOSE TO ZERO. YOU HAVE NO GROWTH SO IT'S STAGNANT AND SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO START ACCUMULATING WEALTH FROM NOTHING. WHEREAS IF YOU START WITH SOME INITIAL WEALTH IT MAKES IT EASIER --
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT CAPITALISM BENEFITS CAPITALISTS.
WELL, WHEN YOU HAVE A LOW-GROWTH RATE THEN INDEED IT BENEFITS OWNERS MORE THAN IT OUGHT TO.
WAIT A SECOND. WHO GETS TO SAY HOW MUCH IT OUGHT TO. I'M THE ONE THAT TOOK THE RISK. I'M THE JOB CREATOR.
RIGHT, ARE YOU THE JOB CREATOR BUT YOU WANT MOBILITY, AND NEW GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ENTER THE ECONOMIC GAME. INEQUALITY IS FINE UP TO A POINT BUT IF IT GETS TOO EXTREME IT'S NOT GOOD YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOOD BECAUSE YOU SOME MOBILITY IN SOCIETY --
LET'S TAKE THAT FOR A SECOND.
PLEASE, PLEASE, WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION, DO NOT APPLAUD MY FACIAL HAIR WHILE THE MAN IS TALKING. OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT IDEA. THAT YOU WANT MOBILITY. YOU WANT MOBILITY. INEQUALITY IS BAD BECAUSE YOU WANT MOBILITY. BUT IF I AM ALREADY MOBILED UP TO THE PLACE I WANT TO BE, ISN'T IT BETTER FOR ME TO PULL UP THE LADDER BEHIND ME. AND IT MAKES THINGS BETTER BECAUSE THEN I CAN BE CHARITABLE WITH MONEY THAT I DON'T EVEN MISS TO ALL THE POOR PEOPLE I CAN EASILY FIND.
NO, IT IS BETTER TO CHOOSE YOUR TAX RATE THAN LET OTHERS CHOOSE IT
THANK YOU, THANK YOU
OF COURSE.
IN FACT, THIS COUNTRY INVENTED PROGRESSIVE TAXATION OF INCOME AND INHERITED WEALTH. AND SOMEHOW WE'VE FORGOTTEN THAT SINCE THE 1980s BECAUSE THE COUNTRY HAS MOVED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
BECAUSE REAGAN CAME IN AND IT WAS MORNING IN AMERICA.
IT WAS MORNING IN AMERICA EXCEPT THAT THE GROWTH PERFORMANCE OF AMERICA WAS ACTUALLY BETTER IN THE 50s 60s AND 70s THAN IN THE 1980s. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAST 30 YEARS  YOU HAVE RISING INEQUALITY EVERYWHERE EXCEPT IN THE GROWTH STATISTICS. IF YOU TAKE THE GROWTH PERFORMANCE OF THE U.S. OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, YOU HAVE 1.5 PERCENT GROWTH RATE. SO YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO THE TOP PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
THIS IS NOT A GOOD DEAL FOR THE REST OF THE POPULATION.
REALLY --
WELL.
THEY SHOULD GET THEIR OWN TV SHOW. THOMAS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THOMAS PIKETTY, CAPITAL IN THE 21st CENTURY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
