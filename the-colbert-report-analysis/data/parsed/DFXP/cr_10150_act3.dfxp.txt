Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. REALLY GREAT, REALLY GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S INCREDIBLY COOL BECAUSE THERE'S A CONTEXT NOW. BUT PRIOR TO WRITING "THE MUPPET MOVIE," I WAS JUST A GUY, GROWN MAN WHO LIVED WITH PUPPETS IN HIS HOUSE. LIKE I HAD A HOUSE FULL OF PUPPETS.
Stephen: JASON, JASON, WHEN EVERYONE WAS GONE...
YEAH.
Stephen: DID THEY TALK TO YOU? (LAUGHTER)
WHATEVER!
Stephen: WHATEVER. ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT'S IT ABOUT? IT'S ABOUT A KID WHO...
IT'S ABOUT A KID WHOSE MOTHER PASSES AWAY.
Stephen: SO IT'S SAD, IT'S A SAD STORY.
HE HAS A SAD LIFE AT THE BEGINNING. THAT'S HOW HE PERCEIVES IT. HIS FATHER GETS REMARRIED. AND WHEN HE DOES, THE KID STARTS HAVING TERRIBLE NIGHTMARES ABOUT WITCHES EATING HIS TOES, WHICH IS A RECURRING NIGHTMARE THAT I HAD GROWING UP.
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD, YOU DREAMED WITCHES WERE EATING YOUR TOES?
EVERY NIGHT I DREAMT THAT WITCHES WERE EATING MY TOES.
Stephen: I DREAMT, I USED TO DREAM THAT I WAS A SKELETON...
YEAH.
Stephen: AND THEN WHEN I WOULD WAKE UP I WOULD STILL THINK I WAS A SKELETON.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND I HAD TO TOUCH LIKE FLESHY HUMANS TO KNOW THAT I WASN'T.
WOW!
Stephen: CAN YOU IMAGINE WAKING UP TO THAT? A LITTLE BOY OVER YOU, TOUCHING YOU IN YOUR SLEEP SO THAT YOUR SKIN WOULD GO AROUND MY BONES AND I WOULDN'T BE A SKELETON ANYMORE.  (LAUGHTER)
YEAH.
Stephen: YEAH.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S WHY WE ENDED UP HERE? LIKE, I DO.
Stephen: WHY YOU'RE IN COMEDY AND I'M IN NEWS? (LAUGHTER)
YEAH WELL...
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT.
IT TAKES LIKE A SLIGHT DELUSION, I THINK, I'VE ALWAYS FELT, TO BELIEVE THAT LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS WORTHY OF PEOPLE SITTING THERE AND PAYING MONEY TO LISTEN TO.
Stephen: THAT SEEMS NATURAL TO ME.
DOES IT?
Stephen: THAT SEEMS NATURAL TO ME.
IT DOES TO ME TOO, BUT I DON'T THINK IT SEEMS NATURAL TO EVERYBODY ELSE.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: OH NO, EVERYBODY SHUT UP, I'M TALKING.

SO PEOPLE WOULD BE, LIKE, HEY, MARSHALL! HEY, MARSHALL! I HATE TO BOTHER YOU BUT ARE YOU MARSHALL? BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY'VE DUBBED MY VOICE WITH, LIKE, MY CHARACTER'S LIKE A LOVEABLE OAF, AND THEY DUBBED ME WITH LIKE PEOPLE EVEN STUPIDER SOUNDING THAN ME.
