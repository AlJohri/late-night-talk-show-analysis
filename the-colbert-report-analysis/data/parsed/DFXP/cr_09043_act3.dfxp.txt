[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A TALKSHOW  HOST WHO THINKS HE KNOWS WHAT'S  BEST FOR AMERICA. SORRY, THAT JOB'S TAKEN. PLEASE WELCOME PIERS MORGAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: HOW ARE YOU?
VERY GOOD, THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  COMING ON. I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW AND I  MEAN THIS IN THE MOST RESPECTFUL  WAY POSSIBLE GET (bleep) OUT OF TOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY? NO, NO AFTER THE INTERVIEW.
OKAY.
Stephen: YOU UNDERSTAND TO  AN AMERICAN EAR WHAT IT SOUNDS  LIKE TO HAVE AN ENGLISH ACCENT TELLING US HOW TO LIVE OUR  LIVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
I ACTUALLY DO, YES. I KNOW HOW ANNOYING IT IS, YES.
Stephen: YOU COME FROM A  PLACE WITHOUT THE SECOND  AMENDMENT.
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE GUNS. LITERALLY WE DON'T HAVE GUNS. YOU CAN'T GET YOUR HANDS ON  THEM. THE POLICE DON'T HAVE THEM. PEOPLE IN BRITAIN DON'T HAVE  GUNS.
Stephen: YOU HATE THE  UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
I LOVE IT.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER READ  A COPY OF IT. HERE IS IS A COPY OF IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S A VERY NICE COPY.
Stephen: SECOND AMENDMENT  SAYS "CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO  LAW --" THEY CAN MAKE LAWS -- "NO LAW -- DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH.
WE GAVE YOU OUR LANGUAGE AS  YOU KNOW.
Stephen: WE TOOK IT WITH  OUR GUNS. [ LAUGHTER ]
CORRECT.
Stephen: AT LEXINGTON  CONCORD, IT WAS THE SHOT HEARD  ROUND THE WORLD NOT THE DEBATE OR WHISTLE OR REPORT. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE  THAN DO YOU.
YOU LOVE YOUR GUNS, I KNOW  YOU DO.
Stephen: WE DO LOVE OUR  GUNS. HOW DEAR YOU TELL AMERICANS HOW  TO LIVE THEIR LIVES.
QUIETINGLY POINTING OUT IF MY  COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE NO GUNS WE  HAVE 35-40 GUN MURDERS A YEAR. IN YOUR COUNTRY 11,000. I THINK WHERE 20 YOUNG AMERICANS  ARE BLOWN TO PIECES, AMERICANS  SHOULD SAY SOMETHING HAS TO BE  DONE.
Stephen: WELL, I THINK IT'S  A CHEAP SHOT TO BRING UP THE  SUBJECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY. FEVERS ARE RUNNING VERY HIGH. NOBODY WANTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN  MORE THAN I DO BUT FEVERS ARE  RUNNING VERY HIGH RIGHT NOW. WE SHOULD STOP AND TAKE SOME  TIME UNTIL WE CAN APPROACH THIS  IN A CALM MANNER.
NONSENSE.
Stephen:, NO, NO,. THAT'S THE KIND OF IRRATIONAL  PASSION I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE NEED TO TAKE THE TIME,  REFLECT AND EVENTUALLY FORGET  AND THEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- THEN I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE  SUCH A HEATED DEBATE.
THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN MASS  SHOOTINGS IN AMERICA LAST YEAR. IT'S A VERY, VERY HARD TO START  THE DEBATE WHEN IT'S TOO SOON  BECAUSE WE'RE FOLLOWING THE LAST  ONE.
Stephen: I'M NOT HAVING YOU  HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR MASS  SHOOTINGS. I'M HAVE YOU ADVOCATE FOR  FREEDOM. UNTIL ENGLAND YOU DON'T HAVE  FREEDOM.
WE LIKE --
Stephen: NO, NO THE QUEEN  CAN COME IN AND TAKE YOURS.
A LOT OF AMERICANS THINK OUR  ROYAL FAMILY IS GOING TO LAUNCH  A ATTEMPTED INVASION OF YOUR  COUNTRY. THE QUEEN AND KATE MIDDLETON ARE  ABOUT TO ARRIVE, COME IN AND  TAKE YOUR A RIRKS-15'S FROM YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S RIDICULOUS  THEY WOULD HIRE HERBANS TO COME  HERE AND HAVE THE EAR QUOAS TO COME -- EAR IRIQUOIS TO COME  AGAINST THEM.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY WE HAVE  GUNS TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FROM  TAKING OUR GUNS. THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS  INTENDED. HAVE YOU READ THE CONSTITUTION?
I HAVE.
Stephen: READ THE  CONSTITUTION.
I HAVE.
Stephen: YOU ARE HAVING  PEOPLE -- PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU  ARE JUST PUMPING UP YOUR RATINGS BY HAVING ON CRAZY PEOPLE. WHY NOT HAVE REASONABLE PEOPLE  ON TO TALK ABOUT -- PEOPLE ON  THE PRO-GUN SIDE OF DEBATE WHO HAPPEN TO BE REASONABLE VOICES  WHO THINK THERE ARE SOMETHING  THAT CAN BE DONE.
NONE OF THEM THINK WE SHOULD  TAKE ANY GUNS AWAY.
Stephen: I KNOW BECAUSE  IT'S NOT REASONABLE BECAUSE IT'S  NOT CONSTITUTIONAL. HAVE YOU READ THE CONSTITUTION?
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER COPY? [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: GOOD TO SEE
