(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! NOW, FOLKS -- NOW, BEFORE THE BREAK, I WAS TELLING ALL THE PEOPLE HERE ABOUT THE POWER OF TWITTER. IT HAS HUMBLED MORSI, BROUGHT DOWN GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST BUT IT DID NOT GET ME. HERE TO APOLOGIZE, PLEASE WELCOME THE FOUNDER OF TWITTER, BIZ STONE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BIZ, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JUST DROPPING EVERYTHING AND FLYING IN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT HERE TO APOLOGIZE.
Stephen: I ACCEPT (LAUGHTER)
BUT WE WILL GET A CHANCE THE TALK ABOUT MY NEW BOOK.
Stephen: WE'LL GET TO THAT. OKAY.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING -- WHEN YOU FOUNDED TWITTER, DID YOU DO IT JUST TO ATTACK ME? (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, DID YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE THIS KIND OF HASHTAG ACTIVISM? WAS THIS PART OF THE DREAM?
UM, THE DREAM WAS TO CREATE A PLATFORM FOR, YOU KNOW, GLOBAL FREE SPEECH.
Stephen: OKAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, WHEN SOMEONE FIRST PROPOSED USING HASHTAGS, I SAID, THAT'S THE NERDIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. NO ONE WILL EVER DO THAT.
Stephen: MM-HMM. YOU WERE WRONG.
I WAS WRONG (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BUT IT HAS BECOME AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL THING. IT'S TAKEN DOWN DICTATORS ACROSS THE WORLD, BUT DID NOT TAKE DOWN ME. AM I NOW THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN " )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE SOUND OF PEOPLE MINDLESSLY CHANTING YOUR NAME, THAT'S THE SOUND OF FREEDOM (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UPSET BY THAT TWEET, BUT I NEVER WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN, AND THE NETWORK VERY KINDLY GAVE ME CONTROL OF @COLBERTREPORT.
I HAVE A KILL SWITCH TO IMMEDIATELY DELETE ANY TWITTER ACCOUNT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, GET IT OUT.
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, GET READY. (LAUGHTER) ONE LAST TWEET, EVERYBODY. OKAY. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A TWEET FROM ME, FOLLOW @STEPHENATHOME, BYE-BYE. HIT IT! THANK YOU, BIZ! WE'LL BE BACK WITH THE C OF TWITTER BIZ STONE!
