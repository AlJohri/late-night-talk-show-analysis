Stephen:  WHOOO! WHOOO! WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. OH! OH, NATION!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. ARE YOU SUNSHINE ON THE ROSES OF  MY PATRIOTISM. AND YOU KNOW, NATION, THERE IS  NOTHING MORE PRECIOUS IN AMERICA  THAN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. WITHOUT IT, I WOULD NOT HAVE  THIS SHOW TO CONVINCE YOU THAT  THERE'S NOTHING MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE SECOND AMENDMENT. ( LAUGHTER )  AND THAT'S WHY IT IS MY DUTY TO  FIGHT CENSORSHIP WHEREVER AND  WHENEVER I HAVE CLEARED IT. NATURALLY, I AM OUTRAGED ON A  RECENT CLAMP-DOWN ON ONE OF THE  AMERICA'S BASTIONS OF FREEDOM.
IT'S NO SHOCK TO ANYONE ON  YOUTUBE. USERS ON THE WEB SITE CAN BE  MEAN AND DOWNRIGHT NORTHWEST. GOOGLE IS NOW HOPING TO CHANGE  THAT. THE YOUTUBE OWNERS HAVE JUST  ROLLED OUT A NEW SYSTEM THAT  WILL PUT THE TOP COMMENT FROM PEOPLE YOU KNOW OR CARE ABOUT,  NOT JUST WHO HAS COMMENTED MOST  RECENTLY. VIDEO CREATORS WILL ALSO GET TO  MODERATE CONVERSATIONS AND BLOCK  CERTAIN WORDS.
Stephen:  NATION, THIS IS  AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON FREE  SPEECH. YOUTUBE COMMENTS ARE THE FREEST  SPEECH THERE IS, FROM OF FREE  FROM PUNCTUATION. FREE FROM SPELLING. APPARENTLY, FREE FROM MEDICATION   MEDICATION. THE YOUTUBE COMMENT SECTION IS  THE INTERNET'S TOWN SQUARE AIR,  PLACE WHERE CITIZENS OF ALL MANKIND CAN JOIN IN A GLOBAL  DIALOGUE ON SUCH TIMELESS TOPICS  ON WHETHER THAT TEEN SING "CALL ME MAYBE" IN A RAMBO WIG IN A  BEDROOM SHOULD KILL YOURSELF  RIGHT NOW SUCK HORSE BALLS. PERSONALLY, I DONT THINK HE  SHOULD. BUT I WILL DEFEND TO THE DEATH  FOR YOU TO POST IT. FOLKS, UTWIEWB UPLOADERS CAN  SILENCE DESCENTERS, WE'LL  FOREVER LOSE THOUGHT-PROVOKING CHANGES LIKE THIS ONE BENEATH AN  OLD HUSKERS DU VIDEO:  "MUSICDOOD:  GREAT SONG NEVER HEARD THEM BEFORE."  "TAINTGUITAR-21:  UR HOMO."  "UTAH-FERRET-LOVER ( BLEEP )  MOTHERHEAD RULES!" "RON PAUL 2012."  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ). THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I HAVE PENNED  A PROTEST LETTER TO STOP THIS  CENSORSHIP. I WANT YOU TO GO TO car  colbertnation.com, CALM THE  LETTER AND POST IT UNDER EVERY YOUTUBE VIDEO YOU SEE. HE COMMENTERS OF YOUTUBE,  BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECHES  STRONGLY AS WE BELIEVE IN FREE VIDEO OF ANIMALS DRESSED LIKE  OTHER ANIMALS. THEREFORE, WE HEREBY DECLARE:  YOU CAN MAKE UP TO $88 AN HOUR  WORKING FROM YOUR HOUSE. CLICK HERE FOR ONE WEIRD TIP ON  HOW TO LOSE YOUR BELLYFAT. YOU ARE HOMO. RON PAUL 2012!"  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S JUST A  SUGGESTION. FEEL FREE TO PERSONALIZE IT WITH  AN EXTRA "YOU ARE HOMO."  INACTION, YOU KNOW, WHEN I PLAY SPORTS, I DON'T WEAR A CUP. I NEED A QUART. THIS IS THE SPORREPORT. ATION, ARE YOU READY FOR SOME.N  FOOTBALL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE I DON'T  THINK FOOTBALL IS. BECAUSE THE CRANIUM CODDLERS OUT  THERE KEEP RUINING THE GAME. NEW PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING  N.C.A.A. RULES ON TARGETING  DEFENSELESS PLAYERS ABOVE THE HEAD ARE ALREADY HAVING AN  IMPACT ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
YOU CANNOT HIT A PLAYER IN  THE HEAD THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE SITUATION.
Stephen:  THAT IS THE  SITUATION? I MEAN, COME ON! SINCE WHEN DID PEOPLE'S HEADS  GET SO VULNERABLE? LAST TIME I CHECKED, WE'RE ALL  WEARING BONE HELMETS AROUND OUR  THINK MEAT. ( LAUGHTER )  THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE, FOLKS. TODAY YOU CAN'T HIT SOMEONE IN  THE HEAD. TOMORROW THE QUARTERBACK HAS TO  PLAY THE WHOLE GAME STRAPPED  INTO A CAR SEAT. ( LAUGHTER )  LOOK, I BELIEVE THIS IS A WAR ON  AMERICA'S GAME, RIGHT, FOX NEWS'  "THE FIVE."
THE WAR ON FOOTBALL.
I DO THINK THERE'S A WAR ON  FOOTBALL.
THEY WANT TO WUSSIFY AMERICA  AND THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF  HOW THE WITH USIFICATION OF AMERICA WILL RUIN US IN THE  FUTURE.
THE TACKLE DUMMY IS RIGHT. AMERICA IS GETTING WITH USIFIED,  STARTING WITH THE WORD WITH USE,  WHICH IS THE WITH USE'S WAY OF SAYING PUSSY. SO WHAT IF FOOTBALL PLAYERS TAKE  THEIR LIVES INTO THEIR HANDS  EVERY SUNDAY. FOOTBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS WAR. RIGHT, ANDREA TANTAROS?
THERE'S A LOT OF SIMILARITIES  TO THE MILITARY. THINK ABOUT THIS-- THE LANGUAGE  THEY USE "TOUCHING DOWN. GROUND GAME."
Stephen:  RIGHT YOU ARE,  ANDREA. I LOVE IT WHEN SOMEONE SCORES A  TOUCHING DOWN. AND THEN KICKS THE FIELDING  GOAL. THE POINT IS, ALL THIS WORRY  OVER HEAD TRAUMA IS A WASTE OF  ENERGY. YOU CAN STILL HAVE A LONG AND  PRODUCTIVE CAREER WITH A  DEBILITATING CONCUSSION. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THE 5s. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  BIG GANS OF THE 5s TONIGHT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER  LIKED CHESS. I'M A TRADITIONALIST. IF I WANT TO LOSE TO A COMPUTER  OR SOMETHING, I'LL JUST TRY TO  UPDATE WINDOWS. YOU WIN AGAIN, YOU BASTARD! NOW, FOLKS I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE  TRYING TO KEEP CHESS IN CHESS.
THE "SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE"  REPORTS POLICE ARE CRACKING  CRACK DOWN ON STREET CHESS. FOR DECADES POLICE POOEM HAVE  GATHERED TO PLAY STREET CHESS ON  MIDMARKET STREET. MANY ARE HOMELESS.
Stephen:  FINALLY SUDDEN  FRANKERS ARE SAFE FROM THE  PUBLIC MENACE OF CHESSING WHICH HAS TURNED THE TENDER LOIN  NEIGHBORHOOD INTO A HOT BED FOR  ILLEGAL GAMBLING, DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE, VIOLENCE, EVEN  BARBECUE WINGS. YES, GRILLED MEATS HAVE NO PLACE  IN A NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED THE  TENDER LOIN. ( LAUGHTER )  CLEARLY, FOLKS, CHESS IS A  DANGEROUS GAME AND TOO MANY OF  OUR PARKS AND PUBLIC SPACES ARE DEVOLVING INTO 16-ON-16 BRAWLS,  MANY WITH RACIAL OVERTONES. FOR MORE WE TURN TO THE  SPOR-REPORT'S LONGTIME CHESS  CORRESPONDENT... LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WEIGHY 150 POUNDS  FLOYD MONEY MAYWEATHER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HOW ARE YOU, MAN? SIT DOWN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  FLOYD-- FLOYD, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD  TO SEE YOU. NOW, FLOYD YOU ARE THE UNIFIED  SUPER WELTERWEIGHT WORLD  CHAMPION. YOU'VE WON 10 WORLD TITLES  ACROSS FIVE DIFFERENT WEIGHT  CLASSES. YOU'RE UNDEFEATED AS A  PROFESSIONAL FIGHTER, POUND PER  POUND THE GREATEST BOXER OF ALL  TIME. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU PLAY  CHESS.
I LOVE CHESS, STEPHEN. THE SWEET SCIENCE.
Stephen:  FLOYD, MY FRIEND,  IS CHESS AS DANGEROUS AS THE SAN  FRANCISCO POLICE SAY?
IT CAN BE, STEPHEN, BUT WITH  TRAINING, CHESS CAN BE A  SYMPHONY OF TACTICS, SKILLS, AND  CREATIVITY.
Stephen:  IT SOUND TO ME  LIKE IT'S A SYMPHONY OF DRUGS,  VICE PRESIDENCY, AND BARBECUE. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN, THERE ARE ALWAYS  GOING TO BE SOME BAD APPLES ON  THE CHESS BOARD. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND,  FOR KIDS IN A TOUGH  NEIGHBORHOOD, CHESS IS THE ONLY WAY OUT. THEY CAN PICK UP THE GAME FOR  THE WRONG REASONS-- MONEY,  WOMEN, FAME, HOW IT LOOKS ON A COLLEGE APPLICATION.
Stephen:  FLOYD, HOW DID  YOU STAY STRAIGHT?
WELL, I WAS LUCKY. MY FATHER BUT A BISHOP IN MY  HAND WHEN I WAS THREE. BY THE TIME I WAS SIX, I CHECK  MATED A MAN TWICE WHIE SIZE.
Stephen:  SPEAKING OF  WHICH, MY FRIEND, YOU HAVE A BIG  GAME COMING UP FACING WORLD CHAMPION MAGNUS CARLSEN, IN  REYKJAVIK, ICELAND. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM MAGNUS?
YOU KNOW MY BOY MAGNUS IS  VERY AGGRESSIVE. HE BRINGS HIS QUEEN OUT EARLY.
Stephen:  BOLD MOVE, HOW DO  YOU THINK YOU'LL RESPOND?
MOST LIKELY, I'LL PUNCH HIM  IN THE FACE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THAT'S WHY YOU'RE  THE CHAMP! FLOYD MAYWEATHER, EVERYBODY!
