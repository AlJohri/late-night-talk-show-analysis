( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. WELCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THANK YOU, FOLKS. SIT DOWN. FOLKS THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, YOU, MY BROTHERS, IT WAS GORGEOUSITY AND YUM YUM YUM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. I TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT THE RECENT SURGE OF VIOLENCE IN IRAQ AND HOW IT CAUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA WITH HIS MOM JEANS DOWN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- EVERY BRUTAL TERRORIST ONSLAUGHT HAS A SILVER LINING. IN THIS CASE IT BROUGHT BACK MY OLD PALS, THE IRAQ PACK, AND THEY ARE SINGING THE SAME OLD TUNES.
LOOK, I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO KEEP AN AMERICAN PRESENCE IN IRAQ.
PRESIDENT BUSH DID EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING IN OVERTHROWING SADDAM HUSSEIN.
I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAQ TODAY. THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT BARACK OBAMA DID.
GENERAL PETRAEUS HAD THE CONFLICT WON, THANKS TO THE SURGE. WE HAD THE CONFLICT WON. AND WE HAD A STABLE GOVERNMENT.
Stephen:  JOHN McCAIN IS RIGHT-- WE HAD THAT CONFLICT WON IN 2009 WHEN WE LEFT IRAQ A PEACEFUL, SMOLDERING DEMOCRACY. ( LAUGHTER ) I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE OF BAGHDAD AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SURGE.  ♪  ♪   ( CHEERS ).
Stephen:  OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE WERE A FEW UPTICKS IN VIOLENCE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART, WHEN WE LEFT THE SUNNI AND THE SHIA WERE BRONIES. IT WAS ESPECIALLY NICE TO SEE THE RETURN OF THE LEADER OF THE IRAQ PACK, OLD DEAD EYES. HE CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER HIS UNDISCLOSED ROCK TO POINT AN ICY FINGER OF TRUTH AT BARACK OBAMA. IN AN OP-ED IN WHAT MANY ARE CALLING THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," CHENEY WRITES, "RARELY HAS A U.S. PRESIDENT BEEN SO WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH AT THE EXPENSE OF SO MANY." YES, RARELY, MAYBE ONLY ONE OTHER TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, THE LIBERALS, THE LIBERALS--   ( CHEERS ) , OF COURSE, THE LIBERAL MEDIA WENT RIGHT AFTER HIM, ESPECIALLY LEFT WING LOON MEGYN KELLY.
TIME AND TIME AGAIN, HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG AS WELL IN IRAQ, SIR. YOU SAID THERE WAS NO DOUBT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. YOU SAID WE WOULD BE GREETED AS LIBERATORS. YOU SAID THE IRAQ INSURGENCY WAS IN THE LAST THROES BACK IN 2005. AND YOU SAID THAT AFTER OUR INTERVENTION EXTREMISTS WOULD HAVE TO "RETHINK THEIR STRATEGY OF JIHAD." NOW WITH ALMOST $1 TRILLION SPENT THERE, WITH 4500 AMERICAN LIVES LOST THERE, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU WERE SO WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH AT THE EXPENSE OF SO MANY?
NO, I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE, REAGAN-- MEGYN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  THAT WAS NO MISTAKE. AS A TRUE CONSERVATIVE, EVERY SENTENCE HAS TO CONTAIN AT LEAST ONE REAGAN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE JUST FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREES WITH REALITY. IT'S EASY NOW TO MONDAY MORNING "NOT INVADE IRAQ" BUT DICK CHENEY REMEMBERS HOW IT FELT AT THE TIME SO RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE TRACK RECORD. WE INHERITED A SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN ANYBODY'S MIND ABOUT THE EXTENT OF SADDAM'S INVOLVEMENT IN WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
Stephen:  THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE EXTENT OF SADDAM'S INVOLVEMENT IN W.M.D.s, BUT WE DID THE RIGHT THING AND INVADED ANYWAY. FOLKS, IT TAKES HUEVOS RANCHEROS TO BLAME THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR YOU STARTED ON THE MAN WHO ENDED IT. IN FACT, I'D SAY THOSE THINGS HE'S SWINGING COULD BE BALLS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WHICH MEANS WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO INVADE DICK CHENEY'S SACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WE HAVE GOT SATELLITE IMAGERY OF THIS MAN'S NUTS, AND HE IS DEFINITELY HIDING SOMETHING DOWN THERE, MAYBE ALUMINUM TUBES. I DON'T KNOW. NOW, FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS I CANNOT SHOW THEM TO YOU. JUST TRUST ME THAT THE WHITE POWDER IN COLIN POWELL'S VIAL THIS TIME IS GOLD BOND. ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, YOU KNOW ME, I BELIEVE IN THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY. THAT'S WHY I ONLY EAT GRAHAM CRACKER AND VELVEETA SANDWICHES. THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD.   ( CHEERS ) ( APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION, THERE IS ONE CRUCIAL THING A CHILD NEEDS-- NAME-BRAND FOOD PRODUCTS. YOU GOT EVERY SUBJECT RIGHT THERE IN THE VENDING MACHINE-- THREE MUSKETEERS-- THAT'S ENGLISH CLASS. BUGLES-- THAT'S BAND. AND AQUAFINA-- PRETTY SURE THAT'S LATIN. BUT THE MICHELLE OBAMA HEALTH-STAPO IS NOW CRACKING DOWN ON THE MARKETING OF  LESS-NUTRITIOUS FOODS IN SCHOOLS WITH NEW RULES LIMITING HOW MUCH FAT, SUGAR, AND SODIUM THEY CONTAIN, INGREDIENTS WHICH ARE USUALLY LIMITED ONLY BY OUR IMAGINATION. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) ( LAUGHTER )
AND, FOLKS, THIS POSES A PARTICULAR THREAT TO DOMINO'S PIZZA WHO HAVE OUTLETS IN 3,000 SCHOOLS IN 38 STATES BUT THEY'VE OUTSMARTED THE FIRST LUNCH LADY BY INTRODUCING THE DOMINO'S SMART SLICE WHICH HAS ONE-THIRD LESS FAT IN THE PEPPERONI, ONE-THIRD LESS SALT IN THE SAUCE, AND CHEESE WITH HALF THE FAT SO THAT IT FITS THE NEW HEALTH STANDARDS. BUT DON'T WORRY, THESE CHANGES DON'T SACRIFICE THE USUAL DOMINO'S-- I WANT TO SAY TASTE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOR EXAMPLE, SCHOOL FOOD MUST CONTAIN AT LEAST 50% WHOLE GRAINS. SO 51% OF THE SMART SLICE CRUST USES A WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR THAT IS MADE TO LOOK AND TASTE LIKE IT'S WHITE FLOUR AND THAT SENDS A GREAT MESSAGE TO OUR KIDS-- 51% IS A PASSING GRADE.   ( CHEERS ) ( APPLAUSE ) BEST OF ALL, BEST OF ALL, DOMINO'S HAS NO PLANS TO SELL THE SMART SLICE IN SHOPS. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH IS WHY I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING NO ONE'S EVER SAID TO DOMINO'S BEFORE-- WELL DONE. BECAUSE YOU-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU, DOMINO'S, HAVE THE MEANS AND CAPABILITY TO CRAFT A HEALTHIER PIZZA THAT LOOKS AND TASTES LIKE YOUR NORMAL PRODUCT BUT YOU REFUSE TO SELL IT TO ME. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW THAT IF I'M ORDERING DOMINO'S, I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN HEALTH. IN FACT, I MIGHT HAVE A DEATH WISH. ( LAUGHTER ) FINALLY-- BY THE WAY, IT'S DELICIOUS. YOU SHOULD EAT IT. FINALLY, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SNACKING, AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE THE BIGGEST GULPS. WE HAVE THE SLIMMEST JIMS. EVEN OUR YUNS ARE THE FUNNEST. BUT, FOLKS, DORITOS, DORITOS HAS JUST KICKED OUR SNACKING UP A NOTCH WITH THREE NEW MYSTERY FLAVORS IDENTIFIED ONLY BY THE NUMBERS 404, 855, AND 2653. FINALLY, DORITOS IS NAMING CHIPS FOR THE ATOMIC NUMBERS OF THEIR ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ALL I KNOW ABOUT THESE CHIPS, ALL I KNOW ABOUT THESE CHIPS IS THAT AT SOME POINT DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THEY BECAME JACKED. WHICH, ACCORDING TO DORITOS, MEANS THEY'RE 40% BIGGER IN SIZE AND THICKNESS. YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD FOOD WHEN THE MARKETING SOUNDS LIKE SPAM FOR AN ESTONIAN BONER PILL. GUESS WHAT, NATION? ( APPLAUSE ) IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON THESE CHIPS, YOU'RE A COWARD. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE DORITOS VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING, "THERE IS NOTHING AS BOLD AS STEPPING INTO THE UNKNOWN AND CRUNCH INTO AN UNKNOWN MYSTERY CHIP." NOTHING AS BOLD. WE CROSSED OCEANS. WE PUT A MAN ON THE MOON. WE HARNESSED THE POWER OF THE ATOM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT NEVER, NEVER HAVE WE DISCOVERED ANYTHING THAT AMERICANS WON'T EAT. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, FOLKS, I FOR ONE AM UP TO THE CHALLENGE OF HAVING MY TASTE BUDS JACK SLAPPED BY THESE CHIPS, OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO. FIRST OF ALL, I GOTTA SAY, I LOVE THE NONDESCRIPT MIRROR PACKAGING. IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SEE THAT, YEAH, YEAH, I'M THE ONE EATING THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) LET'S TRY SOME 855 RIGHT HERE. MMM-MMM. HOLD ON. MMM. OKAY. I'M GETTING NOTES OF SALT. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT TRANSITIONS INTO A SALTY FLAVOR. BEFORE FINISHING WITH JUST A HINT OF SALT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA FINISH THAT LATER. ( APPLAUSE ) MY ONE QUIBBLE-- MY ONE QUIBBLE IS I STILL KNOW WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT THESE CHIPS. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY'RE DORITOS. WHO WANTS TO GET BOGGED DOWN WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION? I'M TRYING TO EAT HERE, NOT READ. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M INTRODUCING MY OWN EXPERIMENTALLY VAGUE SNACK PRODUCT-- PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EACH BAG OF PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH IS PACKED WITH ITS CONTENTS. WHAT ARE THOSE? EAT SOME AND TELL US. TWEET WHAT YOU THINK YOU ATE AND YOU COULD WIN MORE OF WHATEVER THAT WAS. LOOK FOR IT AT YOUR LOCAL GROCER'S. SERIOUSLY, COULD YOU HELP US LOOK FOR IT BECAUSE SOME OF IT HAS ESCAPED THE LAB. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
