Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF GOOGLE. WHATEVER I LEARN ABOUT HIM, I  WILL SELL TARGETED ADVERTISERS. PLEASE WELCOME ERIC SCHMIDT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ERIC, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. THIS IS GREAT. SIR, AS THE PEOPLE MAY KNOW,  YOU'RE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF  GOOGLE, OKAY.
YES. Stephen: NOW YOU'RE THE  AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK CALLED THE  NEW DIGITAL AGE, RESHAPING THE FUTURE OF PEOPLE, NATIONS AND  BUSINESS.
YES. IT COMES OUT TODAY.
Stephen: IT COMES OUT TODAY. IT DROPPED, AS WE SAY IN THE  WORLD OF HIP HOP. NOW DO I ACTUALLY HAVE TO READ  THIS?
YES. Stephen: IT HAS THE PLAY  THING ON THE FRONT. CAN I JUST TOUCH THAT? DOES A BOOK DOWNLOAD INTO MY  BRAIN?
IT'S 330 PAGES OF WORDS, NO  PICTURES, NO DIAGRAMS.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU KNOW, THE INTERNET IS FULL  OF PICTURES AND DIAGRAMS. DID YOU BRING ME GOOGLE GLASS?
NO BUT WE CAN GET IT. Stephen: SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU A QUALIFIED  DEVELOPER.
Stephen: OF COURSE I AM. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN  PROGRAM IN JAVA ON ANDROID.
Stephen: [BLEEP] YEAH. I LOVE JAVA. I HAVE A CUP EVERY MORNING, MAN. NOW, DID YOU COME HERE IN ONE OF  THOSE DRIVERLESS CARS THAT  GOOGLE HAS?
I WISH. I WILL IN THE FUTURE.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  FUTURE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, DGHTS.
BY THE WAY THE DRIVER OF THIS  CAR IS THE COOLEST THING. YOU WOULD LOVE THIS THING. YOU GET IN IT AND PRESS THE  BUTTON AND YOU DRIVE. IT TAKES 20 MINUTES TO RECOVER  FROM THE CAR DRIVING YOU,  TURNING, STOPPING AND SO FORTH.
Stephen: RECOVER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? TAKE IT TO RECOVER.
IT TAKES YOU TO RECOVER. Stephen: WHY DOES IT TAKE ME  20 MINUTES TO RECOVER?
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO SHOCKED  THAT THE CAR IS DRIVING YOU.
Stephen: REALLY? YES. Stephen: WELL I ALREADY HAVE  A CAR THAT DRIVES ME. HIS NAME IS HERNANDO. OKAY. BUT IS THIS NEW DIGITAL AGE  GOING TO BE GOOD?
YES. Stephen: THE ANSWER IS YES? YES. Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. THE VERY FIRST SENSE OF THIS  DAMNED BOOK IS THE INTERNET IS  AMONG THE FEW THINGS HUMANS HAVE BUILT THAT THEY DON'T TRULY  UNDERSTAND. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE INTERNET?
I DO NOT. NO ONE DOES.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT WAS MY TEST TO SEE WHETHER  YOU WERE HUMAN. YOU PASS. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A ROBOT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE DON'T  UNDERSTAND THE INTERNET? THE INTERNET IS A SERIES OF  TUBES. OF COURSE WE UNDERSTAND IT.
THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT  YOU-TUBE I GUESS.
Stephen: PROBABLY. THE INTERNET IS A QUESTION OF  WHAT PEOPLE DO AND PEOPLE ARE  NOT PREDICTABLE. PEOPLE DO ALL SORTS OF WILD AND  CRAZY STUFF.
Stephen: THE INTERNET IS AN  AGREEMENT.
NO IT'S A CONNECTION OF  EVERYBODY TOGETHER. AND THE NEXT FEW YEARS, FIVE  BILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO JOIN  THE TWO BILLION OF US THAT ARE ALREADY ON IT.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO GO WITH  AGREEMENT. DON'T CORRECT ME ON MY OWN  DAMNED SHOW.
IN ANY CASE WHEN THOSE FIVE  BILLION PEOPLE SHOW UP ALL SORTS  OF STUFF IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: WHO ARE THE FIVE  BILLION PEOPLE AND WHERE ARE  THEY HIDING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN FIVE BILLION  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP ON  THE INTERNET?
TODAY THEY'RE USING DUMB  PHONES, FEATURE PHONES. ALL OF THOSE WILL GET UPGRADED  TO SMART PHONES LIKE THE ONES WE  ALL CARRY.
Stephen: WHERE ARE THESE  PEOPLE COMING FROM?
THEY ALL LIVE IN THE  COUNTRIES THEY CURRENTLY LIVE  IN.
Stephen: DON'T BE COY. WHERE ARE THEY?
AFRICA, ASIA, AMERICA. Stephen: WAS THAT SO HARD? I'M GOING TO LEAVE AND GOOGLE  THESE ANSWERS IF YOU WANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AM I GOING TO HAVE A ROBOT?
YES. EVENTUALLY THEY WILL BE ROBOTIC  ASSISTANTS TO HELP YOU GET ALL  YOUR CHORES DONE.
Stephen: I HAVE A RUMBA. THAT'S A SMALL VERSION OF A  ROBOT. EVENTUALLY, SURE, BECAUSE  COMPUTERS WILL DO WHAT THEY DO  WELL. THEY HAVE INFINITE MEMORY,  REMEMBER EVERYTHING. PEOPLE WILL DO WELL WITH WHAT  WE'RE GOOD AT WHICH IS JUDGMENT.
Stephen: I LOVE PASSING  JUDGMENT ON PEOPLE. AM I GOING TO BE ANONYMOUS IN  THE FUTURE STILL ON THE  INTERNET? IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE  ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT  THE INTERNET IS NOBODY GETS TO KNOW WHO I AM WHEN I'M POSTING  THOSE COMMENTS ON THE YAHOO NEWS  LIKE, LIKE AM I... ARE PEOPLE GOING TO KNOW WHO I AM IN THE  FUTURE.
YOU CAN HAVE THE IDENTITIES  COLBERT, 1, 2, 3.
Stephen: THEY WOULD KNOW  THAT'S ME THOUGH.
IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ENTERS  NATURING YOU.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW I'M PUPPY  LOVER 42.
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE TO BE  ANONYMOUS TO ENGAGE IN WHATEVER  NEFARIOUS ACTS YOU'RE BUSY  DOING. YOU'LL HAVE MULTIPLE IDENTITIES  BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE MULTIPLES  NAMES AND PASSWORD. I THINK PUPPY LOVER 42 IS TAKEN  BY YOU. BUT THERE WILL BE OTHER ONES AS  WELL.
Stephen: CAN I LIVE FOREVER? YES. Stephen: REALLY. NOT NOW. Stephen: I CAN LIVE FOREVER  BUT LATER. SO I JUST HAVE TO LIVE LONG  ENOUGH FOR LATER TO BECOME NOW.
BUT YOUR DIGITAL IDENTITY  WILL LIVE FOREVER. THERE'S NO DELETE BUTTON.
Stephen: ON ME? THAT IS PROFOUND. Stephen: ERIC SCHMIDT, THANK  YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ERIC SCHMIDT, THE NEW DIGITAL  AGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
