Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHER FAMOUS FOR HIS PORTRAITS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. THAT IS GROUNDBREAKING -- IT'S LIKE A SELFIE OF SOMEONE ELSE! PLEASE WELCOME J.R.! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Stephen: J.R., THANK YOU FOR COMING ON! SIT DOWN! NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW, I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE I WAS INTRODUCED TO YOU, YOU ARE A SEMI-ANONYMOUS FRENCH STREET ARTISTS, RIGHT?
RIGHT, WE'LL SAY THAT.
Stephen: YOU'VE INSTALLED WORK IN PARIS, THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE LARGEST ILLEGAL PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION ALSO THE WINNER OF THE 2011 TED PRIZE. WHEN YOU SAY SEMIANONYMOUS, BECAUSE YOU LET PEOPLE SEE YOU BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY YOUR NAME OR LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
I STARTED FROM GRAFFITI, SO MOST OF WHAT I DID WAS NOT REALLY LEGAL (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SO ARE YOU A "CRIMINAL"?
DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTRY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
Stephen: HOW ABOUT THE UNITED STATES?
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN NICE TO ME, FOR NOW.
Stephen: YOU DO LIKE TO HIDE YOUR IDENTITY?
LET'S SAY WHEN YOU DRAW A PORTRAIT ON THE WALL IN CHINA, YOU BETTER NOT PUT YOUR NAME ON THE WALL.
Stephen: WE WILL NOT REVIEW YOUR TRUE NAME AND HAVE DISGUISED YOUR VOICE WITH THAT OUTRAGEOUS ACCENT (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE ART YOU DO. JIM, LET'S SEE IF ART HERE. THIS IS AN INSTALLATION YOU DID IN RIO DE JANEIRO?
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S BEING DONE HERE?
THIS IS IN A PROVINCE IN RIO, AND THOSE ARE FACES AND EYES OF WOMEN FROM THE COMMUNITY, THAT ARE THE PILLARS OF THEIR COMMUNITY, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIDDLE, YOU ONLY SEE VIOLENCE.
Stephen: VERY DANGEROUS. IT IS, BUT ABOUT 80% OF THE POPULATION ARE HAVING A NORMAL LIFE. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HIGH LIGHT. THIS IS BRAZIL.
Stephen: ALL THESE WOMEN'S FACES. WHY WOMEN? YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT TV, ALL I WAS SEEING WAS MEN WITH GUNS AND DRUGS, AND WHEN I WENT THERE, I ACTUALLY SAW WOMEN CARRYING THEIR COMMUNITY, CARRYING THEIR CHILDREN.
Stephen: THESE ARE ORDINARY PEOPLE (APPLAUSE) WHY NOT -- THESE ARE ORDINARY PEOPLE. WHY NOT TAKE PICTURES OF FAMOUS PEOPLE OR CELEBRITIES? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE, A, WE KNOW HOW TO GET PHOTOGRAPHED AND, B, PEOPLE LOVE LOOKING AT US. EVEN SHAKESPEARE WROTE ABOUT KINGS AND QUEENS. WHY MAKE YOUR ART ABOUT ORDINARY FOLKS THAT NOBODY LOOKS AT?
WHEN I WENT THERE FIRST, I DIDN'T SEE YOU.
Stephen: YOU DIDN'T INVITE ME (LAUGHTER) HERE'S ANOTHER ONE YOU DID, THIS IS BETWEEN THE WEST BANK AND ISRAEL.
YES.
Stephen: THESE ARE PHOTOGRAPHS OF ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS DOING THE EXACT SAME JOB. SO THESE GUYS MIGHT HAVE THE SAME JOB ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WALL.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR POINT? (LAUGHTER)
SO, BASICALLY, IMAGINE I TAKE A STEPHEN COLBERT IN PALESTINE AND IN ISRAEL, BOTH ARE DOING THE SAME JOB --
Stephen: TWO OF ME.  SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR  ONE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. I PUT THEM IN THE STREET. I SAY, WHO IS WHO? AND MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE CANNOT RECOGNIZE WHO IS THE ISRAELI AND WHO IS THE PALESTINIAN.
Stephen: YOU TELL ME WHAT SIDE THEY'RE ON, I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S RIGHT (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU CAN JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER?
NOT EXACTLY. I THINK I'M SAYING THAT THE ENEMY ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHO WE THINK THEY ARE. THESE PEOPLE HAVE CRAZY PICTURES AND WHEN YOU PLACE IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE, THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE. SO AN ISRAELI AND PALESTINIANS IN DIFFERENT PLACES, IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL. BUT PEOPLE HELP YOU TO DO IT
Stephen: SO PEOPLE LIKE THIS? FIRST, I DIDN'T GET KILLED, I CAME BACK ALIVE PEOPLE, WHEN I CAME BACK HERE, THEY TOLD ME, YOU'RE SO BRAVE PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOOT YOU
Stephen: DID THEY TOUCH YOU THE WHOLE TIME YOU TALKED? THE FUNNY THING, STEPHEN, IS IT WAS THE EASIEST [BLEEP] THING EVER. I EVEN GOT SUN BURNED. I WENT ON HOLIDAY, CAME BACK. I SAID I'M NOT THE HERO, THE PEOPLE, THEY'RE THE ONE WITH THEIR FACE ON THE WALL WHILE I'M HERE HAVING A DRINK WITH YOU.
Stephen: HERE'S THE PROBLEM. YOU WANT TO HUMANIZE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING AFFECTED BY WAR, IN THIS CASE, OR THESE ARE SOME PEOPLE -- GO TO THE NEXT ONE, JIM -- THESE ARE PEOPLE INSPIRED BY YOU AND APPROVED BY YOU IN PAKISTAN WHO PUT UP THE FACE OF A LITTLE GIRL, A GIANT PORTRAIT THEY MADE IN A FIELD TO SHOW DRONE OPERATORS THAT PEOPLE  LIVE HERE -- TO SHOW THEM WHO LIVES HERE? BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA THAT GETS DRONED BY THE U.S., RIGHT? EXACTLY, I THINK THE BEAUTY OF THAT PROJECT IS FIRST, I WENT TO PAKISTAN AND I NEVER HAD DRONES FLYING OVER MY HEAD. ALL I KNOW IS I WAS THE GUY FLYING THE DRONE, IF I CAN'T SEE THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE I'M FLYING ABOVE, I CAN'T REALIZE THE DAMAGE I'M DOING. THEY PRINTED IT THEMSELVES.  LET ME FINISH, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  WHY CAN'T I START? YOU HAVE TO DO IT ONLY IF IT'S ART AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID AND PRINTED IT THEMSELVES. AND IT'S BEEN PRINTED BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND THE MEDIA.
Stephen: SEEMS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT I HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERY PERSON AS HUMAN. (LAUGHTER) THAT I CAN'T JUST THINK OF PEOPLE AS PART OF A POPULATION OR A STATISTIC. SO THERE'S NOBODY I CAN'T ACCIDENTALLY KILL IN A WAR AND STILL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT WAR.
NO.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU 'RE SAYING ANYBODY WHO DIES IN A WAR THAT'S JUSTIFIED, I HAVE TO GRIEVE OVER?  >>NO, I'M JUST SAYING--
Stephen:  OH I DON'T HAVE TO? >>NO THE QUESTION THAT'S RAISED IS, THE FACT THAT IT WENT SO FAR AND WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, AS AN ARTIST YOU ASK QUESTIONS, YOU DON'T GIVE THE ANSWERS SO I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE CONFLICTED HERE.
Stephen: THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF US. YOU ASK QUESTIONS THAT DON'T GIVE ANSWERS. I DON'T WANT ANY QUESTIONS, I'LL TELL YOU THE ANSWER. ARTIST, PUNDIT.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WE GO WELL TOGETHER. J.R., EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
