[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, THE COLBERT NATION  IS EVER-GROWING. MOSTLY BECAUSE EVERY NIGHT THIS  INSPIRES MILLIONS TO PROCREATE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I ASSUME SOME OF YOU ARE DOING  IT RIGHT NOW, IN WHICH CASE:  BABE RUTH HAD A BATTING AVERAGE OF .342 AND AN EARNED RUN  AVERAGE OF 2.28. YOU'RE WELCOME. [ LAUGHTER ] TONIGHT I WANT TO CONGRATULATE  MY WARDROBE MISTRESS ANTONIA  XEREAS, WHO JUST GAVE BIRTH TO THE NEWEST CITIZEN OF THE  COLBERT NATION:  LOUKAS RAMON SANCHEZ-- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CLASSIC GREEK NAME. WELCOME TO THE WORLD, LOUKAS,  I'VE GOT A LITTLE ADVICE FOR  YOU. CRYING IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO  GET YOUR MOTHER'S ATTENTION. WORKS FOR ME EVERY TIME. NOW, PLEASE, SEND YOUR MOMMY  BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS  POSSIBLE. I CAN'T DRESS MYSELF. THIS IS A CLIP ON. NOT THE TIE-- THE ENTIRE SUIT.
