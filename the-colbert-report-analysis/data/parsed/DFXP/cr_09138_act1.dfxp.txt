Stephen: WHOO! WHOO! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  WELCOME TO THE "REPORT,"  EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH  US. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, LIKE MOST AMERICANS OUT  THERE I LOVE WAKING UP TO MY  PALS OVER AT THE "TODAY" SHOW. I WATCH ALL NINE HOURS EVERY  MORNING. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S MY ONE STOP SHOP FOR NEWS,  SPORTS, WEATHER AND WHO'S  SHARTING IN THE WHITE HOUSE. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, ON FRIDAY "TODAY" HAD MY  FAVORITE RAPPER, FLO-RIDA. THE LAST BLACK MAN WILLING TO BE  ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE OF  FLORIDA. (LAUGHTER)  FAR AND AWAY MR. RIDA IS THE  BEST STATE-NAMED BASED RAPPER  OUT THERE. EVEN BETTER THAN I SDA HO. (LAUGHTER)  ILLIN' NOISE AND, ORTHODOX  JEWISH HIP-HOP ARTIST ARI ZONA. (LAUGHTER)  HOLLA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND I APPLAUD THE VENERABLE  INSTITUTION THAT IS "TODAY" FOR GIVING MR. RIDA A FORUM FOR  DISCUSSING HIS LOVE OF BIG,  JUICY BUTTS. ♪ I WANNA SEE THAT BUTT  ♪ TURN LEFT, TURN RIGHT  ♪ TURN AROUND, YOU CAN TELL WHAT I LIKE ♪  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NOW, THAT MAY SEEM  LIKE A LARGE SERVING OF BUTT FOR  BREAKFAST-- (LAUGHTER)  -- BUT REMEMBER "TODAY" WAITED  UNTIL 8:47 A.M. THAT'S JUST JOURNALISM 10 1. 6:00 A.M., HARD NEWS; 7:00 A.M. HUMAN INTEREST PIECES; 8:30  JACKHAMMERING BADONKADONK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  PLUS, AS YOU KNOW  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  PLUS, DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS ODE TO HIS INCURABLE SICKNESS FOR  THE THICKNESS --  (LAUGHTER)  -- WAS INSPIRED BY OUR LORD.
WELL, I HAVE TO ASK THE FIRST  QUESTION. TELL ME ABOUT THE JESUS PIECE, I  CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF IT.
IT'S A SIGN OF SUCCESS. I PUT GOD FIRST WITH EVERYTHING.
Stephen: FLO-RIDA PUTS GOD  FIRST IN EVERYTHING. HE ONLY WROTE "BUBBLE YUM BUM"  BECAUSE JESUS WAS A BOOTY FAN. AFTER ALL, HE DID SAY "TURN THE  OTHER CHEEK."  PROBABLY SO HE COULD WATCH THE  LADIES TWERK IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO THANK YOU, FLO-RIDA AND THANK  YOU, "TODAY" SHOW BECAUSE I HAD MY MORNING TOAST ALREADY AND YOU  KNEW I WAS READY FOR THAT JELLY. (LAUGHTER)  NOW I AM BECOME DEATH. (LAUGHTER)  DESTROYER OF WORLDS. (LAUGHTER)  OH, HI THERE! I WAS JUST PUTTING THE FINISHING  TOUCHES ON THPL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I TOLD MY NEIGHBOR TO STOP TRIM  MIG SIDE OF THE HEDGES OR HE WOULD REGRET IT. NOW, THIS LITTLE PUPPY DOWN HERE  WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLY WITHOUT J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER OFTEN CALLED  THE FATHER OF THE ATOMIC BOMB--  LEADING TO DEEP INSECURITYS FOR HIS SON JEFFREY WHO JUST NEVER  MANAGED TO BLOW UP HIROSHIMA. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  NOW, OPPENHEIMER LIVED IN  PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, WHICH IS  LOCATED IN THE SUBJECT OF THE 72nd INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART  SERIES "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT."  TONIGHT, NEW JERSEY'S 12th, THE FIGHTING 12th! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU. OTHER NOTABLE PRINCETONIANS  INCLUDE JAMES MADISON, JIMMY  STEWART, MICHELLE OBAMA AND, FROM 1933 TO 18955 PRINCETON  HELD THE HONOR OF BEING THE ONLY  TOWN IN AMERICA WHERE YOU COULD SAY "WAY TO GO, EINSTEIN" AND  HAVE AN OLD MAN SAY "DANG A  SHANE."  (LAUGHTER)  NOW, THE 12th IS ALSO HOME TO SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN  SCALIA, MEANING THAT CLARENCE  THOMAS INSISTS HE'S FROM THERE,  TOO. IF YOU'RE IN THE 12th DON'T MISS  A NIGHT OUT WITH THE MINOR  LEAGUE TRENTON THUNDER. THEY'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING  NEW LIKE THE APRIL 30 ORGAN  DONATION AWARENESS NIGHT WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, WAS ALSO DOLLAR  HOT DOG NIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND WHO HAS THE JERSEY BOYS TO  REPRESENT SUCH DISTRICTS? WHY, NONE OTHER THAN DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN AND PHYSICIST RUSH  HOLT. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE  HOLT IN CHAIRS. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE  FIGHTING 12th.
IT HAS ETHNICITIES MORE  DIVERSE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. YOU GO INTO A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN  ANYWHERE IN THAT PART OF THE  STATE AND YOU'LL FIND MAYBE 25 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN AT  HOME.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE  CONGRESSMAN FOR NEW JERSEY'S  12th BUT YOU ARE RUNNING TO BE THE NEW SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE A SENATOR,  THOUGH? AFTER YEARS OF BEING IN A  DO-NOTHING CONGRESS DO YOU WANT  TO JOIN A DO-NOTHING SENATE?
I WANT TO MAKE THEM A  DO-SOMETHING SENATE. I WANT TO GET THERE WITH  ELIZABETH WARREN.
Stephen: EVERYBODY WANTS TO  GET THERE WITH ELIZABETH WARREN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT  KIDS GET THE HEALTH THEY NEED TO  GET TO COLLEGE.
Stephen: YOU'RE RUNNING  AGAINST NEWARK MAYOR COREY  BOOKER.
OR HE'S RUNNING AGAINST ME.
Stephen: IF CORY BOOKER IS  ELECT HEAD WOULD BE THE FIRST  BLACK SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. TELL THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY  RIGHT NOW WHY YOU THINK IT'S A  BAD IDEA TO ELECT THE FIRST BLACK SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. (LAUGHTER)  WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT TO YOU  TO STOP THAT?
YOU KNOW, RACE IS SOMETHING  THAT IS LOSING ITS MEANING. WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT MOST  PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE OF MIXED  HERITAGE --.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU WERE ON "JEOPARDY" -- LET ME  REPHRASE THAT. THIS MAN HAS FIVE WINS ON  "JEOPARDY" AND EVEN BEAT THE  I.B.M. SUPERCOMPUTER WATTSON.
WHO IS RUSH HOLT?
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT WE'RE  TRYING TO FIND OUT. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, HOW CAN YOUR  CONSTITUENTS KNOW? (LAUGHTER)
I FOLLOW THE FACTS WHEREVER  THEY LEAD AND DEVELOP -- DEVELOP  POLICIES. AND PUT THOSE OUT CLEARLY AND I  THINK COURAGEOUSLY.
Stephen: YOU FIND YOURSELF  COURAGEOUS?
YOU LISTEN --.
Stephen: WHERE DO YOU FIND  COURAGE TO FIND YOURSELF  COURAGES YOU?
I SAID ONE SHOULD FOLLOW THE  FACTS AND PRESENT THEM CLEARLY  AND COURAGEOUSLY.
Stephen: COURAGEOUSLY. OKAY. EDUCATION, BIG ISSUE FOR YOU.
THAT IS PROBABLY AS MUCH AS  ANYTHING-- MAYBE MORE THAN  ANYTHING-- WHAT HAS MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. IT HAS BEEN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION  SYSTEM.
Stephen: ISN'T THERE A LOT OF  WASTE IN EDUCATION? WE HAVE BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY. DO WE NEED EVERY "OLOGY"? (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD TEACH  EVERY SCIENCE TO EVERY STUDENT  EVERY YEAR ALL THE WAY THROUGH  SCHOOL.
Stephen: ASTROLOGY? (LAUGHTER)
I SAID SCIENCE. THAT'S ASTRONOMY.
Stephen: ASTROLOGY IS MORE OF  AN A SCIENCE BECAUSE IT HAS THE  "OLOGY" IN THERE.
WE SHOULD TEACH THEM EVERY  YEAR. NOT JUST TENTH GRADE FOR BIOLOGY  11th GRADE FOR CHEMISTRY --.
Stephen: 12th GRADE FOR  ATROLG. SOME PEOPLE DO BETTER WITH  ARIES, A TAURUS DOES BETTER THAN  W ASTROLOGY. THE  (APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, I --  (LAUGHTER)  WHERE WERE YOU GOING WITH THIS?
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR  BIRTHDAY? I'LL DO YOUR CHART.
YOU DO THAT?
Stephen: I DABBLE.
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND IT TO  WORK?
Stephen: YES! VERY OFTEN INITIATING  CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS LEADS  TO GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND CONTENTMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. WHAT'S YOUR BIRTH DAY?
OCTOBER 15.
Stephen: OH, YOU'RE A LIBRA! THIS IS ALL MAKING SENSE TO ME  NOW. LIBRA. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  CONSERVATIVE VOTERS GAVE YOU  100% RATING.
THE LEAD OF CONSERVATION  VOTERS.
Stephen: CONSERVATION VOTERS? MY APOLOGIES. THAT IS DISAPPOINTING.
WELL, WE SEE WHAT WE LIKE  SOMETIMES.
Stephen: SO AS A TREE-HUGGER,  DO YOU EVER GO ANY FURTHER WITH  THE TREE THAN HUGING? UNDER THE TRUNK ACTION?
UM -- I -- I'M NOT SURE WHERE  YOU'RE GOING.
Stephen: ME EITHER. I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT. YOU WORKED ON LEGISLATION TO  PRESERVE THE OCEAN, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, TRUE?
TRUE.
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU AIDING  THE ENEMY?
THE OCEAN IS OUR FRIEND.
Stephen: HAVE YOU SEEN THE  MOVIE "SHARKNADO"? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  TORNADOS MADE OF SHARKS.
MADE OF SHARKS.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT  TO PROTECT.
I THINK "SHARKNADOS" DON'T  EXIST.
Stephen: THE ONLY WAY TO  FIGHT THEM TO THROW BOMBS INTO  THE TORNADO AND OF COURSE BOMBS DISRUPT TORNADOS.
WELL, EVEN TORNADOS RESULT  FROM THE CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE.
Stephen: WOULD YOU CONSIDER  LEGISLATION TO FIGHT FUTURE  SHARKNADOS?
I THINK THERE ARE MANY  IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO  DEAL WITH AND THAT ARE PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.
Stephen: SUCH A LIBRA THING  TO SAY. (LAUGHTER)  MOVING ON. YOU'RE AGAINST THINGS THAT FLY  OVER AMERICA. YOU'RE SUCH A BIG SCIENCE  EGGHEAD HOW COME YOU DON'T LIKE  THE DRONE PROGRAM? DRONES ARE THE FUTURE?
THE IDEA OF USING ARMED  DRONES TO KILL PEOPLE WITHOUT  DUE PROCESS --.
Stephen: THERE IS DUE  PROCESS. THE PROCESS IS THAT WE DO IT.
INNOCENT CIVILIANS ARE  OBLITERATED WHEN SOMETHING COMES  OUT OF THE BLUE.
Stephen: I'M NOT PRO-CIVILIAN  OBLITERATION, I WANT TO BE ON  RECORD. (LAUGHTER)
THEN WE SHOULD STOP.
Stephen: IT TAKES A  TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE FOR  ME TO SAY THAT. (LAUGHTER)  I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. YOU ARE THE ONLY QUAKER IN  CONGRESS.
YES.
Stephen: QUAKER IS A PACIFIST  RELIGION.
IT'S ANTI-WAR. QUAKERS ARE PROUD OF LOOKING FOR  ALTERNATIVES TO WAR.
Stephen: WOULD YOU ENGAGE ME  A THUMB WAR? LET'S DO IT. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR -- WAIT,  NO, THAT'S CHEATING.
(LAUGHS)
Stephen: YOU JUST -- FIRST  FIRST STRIKING ABILITY,  SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES HAS PROMISED TO NEVER DO. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, I DECLARE  A THUMB WAR. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  GOOD LUCK ON TUESDAY, THE STARS  SAY IT'S VERY FAVORABLE.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: LET'S PUT NEW  JERSEY'S 12th UP ON THE BIG  BOARD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY IN PRINCETON  JUST FAILED THEIR NUCLEAR PHYSICS MIDTERMS. DON'T FORGET, NEW JERSEY, THE  PRIMARY IS TOMORROW. GO VOTE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
