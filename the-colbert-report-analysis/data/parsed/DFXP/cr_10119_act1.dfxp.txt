[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: RIGHT THERE? IS THAT THE ONE? WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY. [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. NATION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT TONIGHT I FEEL TEN YEARS YOUNGER. IT MIGHT BE THE SUMMER SUN OR THE SMELL OF BARBECUE OR THE CHAOS IN IRAQ. [LAUGHTER] JIM?
MILITANTS ON THE MOVE IN IRAQ CONQUERING CITY AFTER CITY.
THEY'VE NOW TAKEN MOSUL, IRAQ'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, TIKRIT, SADDAM HUSSEIN'S HOMETOWN, BAIJI, AN IRAQI OIL REFINERY TOWN, AND TODAY THEY ARE TAKING DIRECT AIM AT BAGHDAD.
THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY IS LITERALLY DISINTEGRATING BEFORE OUR EYES.
THE SITUATION IS GROWING MORE URGENT AS AMERICAN CONTRACTORS ARE FORCED TO EVACUATE AND MILITANTS CONTINUE THEIR MARCH TOWARDS BAGHDAD.
HAPPENING NOW, IRAQ 2.0.
Stephen: YES, IT'S IRAQ 2.0, AND LIKE ANY UPGRADE, IT'S FASTER, ONCE IN A WHILE EVERYTHING CRASHES, AND YOU GET THE ERROR MESSAGE: 404 GOVERNMENT NOT FOUND. [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE, FOLKS, THE NEWS IS IRAQ IS BEING RAPIDLY OVERRUN BY A TERRORIST GROUP OUT OF SYRIA ISIS, THE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. THESE ARE SOME BAD HOMBRES. ISIS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS BETTER ARMS THAN THE NATIONAL ARMIES OF SYRIA AND IRAQ, PARTLY BECAUSE IRAQI SOLDIERS ARE HANDING OVER THEIR WEAPONS AND UNIFORMS PEACEFULLY. IT'S NO SURPRISE IRAQI SOLDIERS ARE SHI'ITING THE BED HERE. JIM?
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN JUST HOW RUTHLESS THEY ARE. THE MILITANTS CLAIM THEY HAVE KILLED 1,700 IRAQIS IN JUST THE LAST DAY.
THEY'RE BRUTAL.
VERY RADICAL, VERY MILITANT, VERY DRACONIAN. HOW DRACONIAN? THEY'VE BEEN ANNOUNCED BY SUCH INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS AS AL QAEDA, WHO HAS NOW OFFICIALLY CHANGED THEIR MOTTO TO "DEATH TO THE INFIDELS, BUT, YOU KNOW, TASTEFUL." SO WHO HAS GOT THE BALLS AND HIS ENEMY'S BALLS TO MAKE AL QAEDA SEEM KIND OF CHILL? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI, A SHADOWY FIGURE KNOWN AS THE INVISIBLE SHEIKH SEEN HERE BEING VISIBLE. [LAUGHTER] AL-BAGHDADI HAS A GROWING ARMY, RECRUITING FIGHTERS FROM OTHER MILITANT GROUPS BY OFFERING TO TRIPLE THEIR SALARIES UP TO $400 A MONTH. $400 A MONTH! BAGHDADI BETTER BE READY FOR A FLOOD OF RESUMES FROM RECENT COMP LIT GRADS AND SOON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND SOON IT MIGHT BE BONUS SEASON.
THE MILITANTS ARE FLUSH WITH CASH. THEY ROBBED MOSUL'S CENTRAL BANK, TAKING OVER $400 MILLION, ACCORDING TO THE CITY'S GOVERNOR.
THEY ARE CONSIDERED NOW THE RICHEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD, VALUED AT $2 BILLION.
Stephen: THE RICHEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD, WHICH MEANS THEY CAN NOW AFFORD MONOGRAMMED SUICIDE VESTS. [LAUGHTER] AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVERYTHING IN AL-BAGHDADI'S AL-BAG OF TRICKS, AS HIS FIGHTERS CLAIM THAT BAGHDADI HAS PLENTY OF HIDDEN SURPRISES FOR HIS ENEMIES. SO A WARNING TO ALL IRAQIS, NO MATTER HOW HUNGRY YOU ARE, NO MATTER HOW DELICIOUS IT LOOKS, DO NOT OPEN THAT CAN OF PEANUT BRITTLE. WORSE, AL-BAGHDADI IS PLANNING TO SOMETHING AMERICA COULD NEVER DO IN IRAQ, NATION-BUILD.
ISIS'S MAIN AIM IS TO EXTEND AN ISLAMIC CALIPHATE  FROM IRAQ TERRITORY OVER INTO NEIGHBORING SYRIA. IRAQ AND SYRIA? WE COULD BE LOOKING AT THE UMAYYAD DYNASTY ALL OVER AGAIN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IF YOU DO PLEASE DROP ME A NOTE BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU, IT CAN NOT BE GOOD. YEAH. IT CANNOT BE GOOD, FOLKS. WHO PUTS TWO Ys IN A ROW? CLEARLY THE MARK OF MAD MAN. THE POINT IS WE'RE FACING THE ALARMING COLLAPSE OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT IT TOOK US EIGHT YEARS OF BLOOD AND TREASURE TO INSTALL, AND IT'S ALL OBAMA'S FAULT. [LAUGHTER] JIM?
I BLAME PRESIDENT OBAMA MIGHTILY FOR A HANDS-OFF  POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO IRAQ.
THE PRESIDENT'S INABILITY TO NEGOTIATE A FORCES AGREEMENT IN IRAQ, WHICH HAS PUT US IN THIS SITUATION WE'RE IN TODAY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A POLITICAL DECISION, A CAMPAIGN PROMISE DECISION, NOT A STRATEGIC VISION DECISION.
HE SIMPLY DIDN'T LIVE UP TO HIS PROMISES OF MORE ARMS AND A DIPLOMATIC SURGE.
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT OBAMA. GREAT JOB, DUDE.
Stephen: YEAH. GREAT JOB, DUDE. OPERATION PARTY FOUL. NEXT KEG IS ON YOU, PRESIDENT BROSEPH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OBAMA WAS THINKING WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH SIGNED THE TROOP WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT IN 2008. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND, YEAH, HMM, HMM, HMM. THANKFULLY FOX NEWS KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS SITUATION.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
WE'VE GOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
WHEN IS THE PRESIDENT GOING TO DO SOMETHING.
HE'S GOT DO SOMETHING. I MEAN, HE CAME OUT TODAY AND SAID HE MIGHT DO SOMETHING IN IRAQ. HE'S GOT DO SOMETHING.
Stephen: YES. THAT'S EXACTLY IT. YES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YES. THAT IS EXACTLY THE THING WE HAVE TO DO. SOME. I SAY WE JUST FIGHT THE BAD GUYS BY HELPING THE GOOD GUYS. AND THE GOOD GUYS ARE EASY TO FIND THANKS TO THIS HANDY CHART OF THE INVOLVED PARTIES. OKAY. LET'S JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO THIS FREAKY 13 WAY. ALL RIGHT. I SAY WE FIGHT ISIS BY SENDING ARMS TO THEIR MORTAL ENEMIES, HEZBOLLAH. OKAY. HEZBOLLAH IS NO GOOD. SO LET'S HELP WHOEVER IS FIGHTING THEM, AL QAEDA. NO. OKAY. THAT DEFINITELY RINGS A BELL. LET'S HELP AL QAEDA'S NEMESIS INSTEAD, BASHAR AL-ASSAD OOH. OH, OH, A LITTLE TOO GASSY-HIS-OWN-PEOPLE-Y. LET'S HELP THE SYRIAN REBELS FIGHTING HIM. HOW ABOUT THOSE GUYS IN AL-NUSRA. I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S AL QAEDA AGAIN. MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE WEAPONS TO AL-NUSRA'S ENEMY, IRAN. OKAY. THAT'S NOT GOOD. WE NEED FIND A WELL-ARMED, WELL-TRAINED MILITIA OUT THERE WILLING TO FIGHT IRAN. I KNOW, ISIS. THOSE GUYS LOOK LIKE WINNERS. THEY ARE KICKING ASS AND TAKING NAMES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HERE TO TELL ME HOW WE CAN BEST HELP ISIS DEFEAT THEMSELVES IS THE MANAGING EDITOR OF THE IRAQ OIL REPORT BEN VAN HEUVELEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, BEN. ALL RIGHT, BEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW BAD IS THIS SITUATION OVER THERE? SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED THAT LEBANON IS NOW THE STABLE MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY? [LAUGHTER]
IT'S VERY BAD. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. OKAY. SO WHAT DO WE DO? CAN WE JUST IGNORE IT? DO WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT? BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO IRAQ WHEN WE STILL HAD TROOPS THERE. WHY SHOULD WE PAY ATTENTION NOW?
I THINK ONE OF THE BEST REASONS TO PAY ATTENTION IS THAT THESE AREAS IN NORTHERN IRAQ NOW THAT ISIS IS CONTROLLING, I THINK IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE TO DRAW ANALOGY BETWEEN WHAT ISIS WANTS DO THERE AND WHAT THE TALIBAN DID IN AFGHANISTAN PRIOR TO 2001. SO IN AS MUCH AS IT'S A BIG THREAT TO COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TO HAVE A GROUP LIKE ISIS CONTROLLING LARGE TERRITORY AND MARSHALING A LOT OF RESOURCES, IT'S A THREAT TO EVERYBODY.
WHAT ABOUT THE OIL? [LAUGHTER] IS THE OIL OKAY? [LAUGHTER] ARE THEY BEING CRUEL TO THE OIL UP THERE?
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE OIL IS ACTUALLY SAFE RIGHT NOW. MOST OF IRAQ'S OIL PRODUCTION IS IN THE SOUTH, WHICH IS SHIA MAJORITY. AND ISIS IS A RADICAL SUNNI GROUP, AND THEY'RE MORE IN THE NORTH. SO THE OIL PRODUCTION IS NOT AFFECTED SO FAR.
Stephen: CAN'T WE SIT BACK, LIKE YOU DUMP A BUNCH OF RED ANTS AND A BUNCH OF BLACK ANTS IN A PILE, AND YOU POUR A LITTLE HONEY IN THE MIDDLE, AND YOU JUST MAKE THEM FIGHT. CAN'T WE JUST DO THAT? WHY DO WE HAVE TO STICK OUR BIG TOE BACK IN THERE? [LAUGHTER]
WELL, I THINK IF WE DON'T STICK OUR BIG TOE BACK IN THERE AT LEAST IN TERMS OF INTERVENING DIPLOMATICALLY AT THE VERY LEAST TO AFFECT SOME POLITICAL CHANGE IN IRAQ, THEN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S GOING TO BE A TERRIBLE HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE WITH MILITIAS AND...
Stephen: HUMANITARIAN, BUT IT'S HUMANI-THEM-IAN, YOU KNOW? DON'T THEY HAVE IT COMING? DO YOU KNOW THE NAMES WE'VE HAD TO MEMORIZE OVER HERE WITH  THOSE PEOPLE? ALL THE ALS, BINS, AND ABDULS AND ALL THAT STUFF. I DON'T HAVE ANY ROOM. I DELETED THOSE NAMES AND FILLED IT WITH PEOPLE FROM THE UKRAINE I CAN'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT ANYMORE. HAVEN'T WE PAID OUR PRICE? [APPLAUSE] HOW BAD, THIS GUY, THIS AL-BAGHDADI GUY, HE'S WILLING TO GO FURTHER THAN  ANYBODY ELSE IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT'S WHY HE MAY NOT HAVE ENJOYED THE SUPPORT ON THE STREET WITH SUNNIS. HOW BAD IS THIS CAT?
HE'S A REALLY, TRULY, HORRIBLE, EVIL PERSON. JUST YESTERDAY THERE WERE REPORTS STILL UNCONFIRMED BUT CREDIBLE THAT HE ORDERED THE EXECUTION OF THOUSANDS OF CAPTURED IRAQI TROOPS. SO HE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON.
Stephen: IS HE THE KEYSER SOZE OF THE MIDDLE EAST.
THAT MIGHT BE FAIR TO SAY. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: WELL, THANKS FOR ALL THE CHEERFUL NEWS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEN VAN HEUVELEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE IRAQ OIL REPORT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
