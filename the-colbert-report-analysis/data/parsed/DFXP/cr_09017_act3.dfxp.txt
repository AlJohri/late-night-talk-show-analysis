PLEASE WELCOME LILLY LEDBETTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MS. LEDBETTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR COMING ON. WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON  HERE.
THANK YOU, IT'S MY PLEASURE  TO BE HERE.
Stephen: WHERE ARE YOU FROM  ORIGINALLY?
ALABAMA.
Stephen: HOW LONG HAVE YOU  BEEN IN NEW YORK THIS WEEK?
SINCE SUNDAY.
Stephen: OKAY, PERFECT TIME  TO VISIT THE CITY.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WONDERFUL. DID WE BRING YOU HERE?
YOU DID, I'VE BEEN IN THREE  HOTEL THIS IS WEEK.
Stephen: HOW MANY?
THREE.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU MOVE?
WELL, THE FIRST ONE GOT  EVICTED AND -- EVACUATED BECAUSE  OF THE CRANE --
OH, THE DANGLING -- THE SWORD  OF DAMOCLES OVER MIDTOWN. OKAY. YOU'RE WELCOME.
Stephen: AND THE SECOND ONE  NO HOT WATER OR HEAT.
OKAY. AND WE GOT YOU INTO A THIRD AND  NOW YOU'RE LIVING IN A --
A THIRD ONE.
Stephen: RIGHT ON THE EAST  RIVER, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: PLEASE COME BACK TO  NEW YORK AGAIN WHEN FACILITIES  ARE IN THE 20th CENTURY.
OKAY, I'LL DO THAT.
Stephen: NOW YOU ARE FAMOUS  BECAUSE YOU WERE AN OVERNIGHT  SUPERVISOR AT THE ALABAMA  GOODYEAR TIRE AND RUBBER COMPANY FOR HOW LONG?
19 YEARS AND TEN MONTHS.
Stephen: NEAR THE END OF YOUR  TENURE THERE YOU FOUND OUT  SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR PAY, WHAT  DID YOU FIND OUT?
I WAS MAKING 40% LESS THAN  THE THREE WHITE MALES DOING THE  EXACT SAME JOB THAT I WAS. AND THAT WAS A DEVASTATING HIT  FOR ME BECAUSE THAT MEANT THAT  MY OVERTIME PAY WAS INCORRECT. WHAT I HAD LEGALLY EARNED UNDER  THE LAW. AND IT ALSO MEANT THAT MY  RETIREMENT WOULD NOT BE CORRECT.
Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU SOUGHT  RELIEF FROM THIS PROBLEM BY  GOING TO THE COURTS. YOU WERE AWARDED $3 MILLION IN  DAMAGES FROM GOODYEAR FROM A  LOWER COURT BUT IT WENT ALL THE  WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT AND WHAT DID THE SUPREME COURT SAY  TO YOU?
THEY SAID I DO NOT FILE MY  CHARGE SOON ENOUGH. JUST ALITO WROTE THE OPINION AND  HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE FILED MY  CHARGE WHEN I GOT THE FIRST  DISCRIMINATORY PAYCHECK EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T KNOW IT. EVEN THOUGH I COULDN'T PROVE IT. BUT HE SAYS THAT I MISSED MY  MARK. BUT THAT WAS NOT CORRECT.
Stephen: WELL, IT'S THE  SUPREME COURT, MADAM.
I UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: HOW DID IT FEEL? THEY TOOK AWAY YOUR $3 MILLION. HOW DID IT FEEL TO HAVE ANOTHER  GROUP OF MEN TAKE AWAY YOUR  MONEY? (LAUGHTER)
PRETTY DEVASTATING. VERY SADDENED.
Stephen: THEIR LOGIC WAS THAT  YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BEFORE YOU  KNEW?
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT WOMEN'S  INTUITION? (LAUGHTER)  WHY NOT THAT THAT? ARE THEY TAKING THAT INTO  ACCOUNT? YOU GUYS HAVE THAT MAGIC POWER.
I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T COVER  UNEQUAL PAY.
Stephen: REALLY.
NO.
Stephen: YOU REALLY OUGHT TO.
I KNOW, WE NEED TO DO THAT.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT A NEW  BOOK HERE CALLED "GRACE AND GRIT  MY FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY AND  FAIRNESS AT GOODYEAR AND BEYOND DO I HAVE TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR  THE BOOK?
ABSOLUTELY, I NEED THE MONEY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I UNDERSTAND PAYING WOMEN --  PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT YOU PAY  MEN. I PAY MY FEMALE INTERNS THE SAME  AMOUNT AS I PAY MY MALE INTERNS. NOTHING. (LAUGHTER)
I HEARD THAT.
Stephen: ONE COLLEGE CREDIT  IN HARD KNOCKS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THIS BECAME AN OPPRESSIVE  FEDERAL LAW. THE VERY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE,  THE FIRST THING BARACK OBAMA  DID, THE FIRST PIECE OF  LEGISLATION HE SIGNED WAS THE LILLY LEDBETTER ACT. NOW YOUR NAME IS IMMORTAL AND  ASSOCIATED WITH WOMEN'S ABILITY  TO WRITE WHAT YOU SEE AS AN  INJUSTICE. WHAT DOES THE LAW DO NOW?
IT ALLOWS THE PERSON, THE  SAME AS I DID WHEN THEY FIND OUT  THAT THEY HAVE BEEN  DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND THEY'RE STILL GETTING A CHECK  THEY HAVE 180 DAYS IN ANY STATE  IN THIS COUNTRY TO FILE A CHARGE  WITH AN T EQUAL EMPLOYMENT  COMMISSION.
Stephen: HOW DOES IT FEEL TO  BE FAMOUS FOR RIGHTING WHAT YOU  SEE AS AN INJUSTICE?
IT'S QUITE AN AWESOME  RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE, AS I  TOLD THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE  SIGNED THAT BILL AND IT'S NAMED FOR ME I FEEL THAT I NEED TO GET  OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND THE  WORLD, IN FACT, AND SHARE MY  STORY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN TO ANY  OTHER AMERICAN FAMILY. BECAUSE THIS GOES ON FOR THE  REST OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S NOT JUST MY PAY, MY  OVERTIME PAY THAT MY CHILDREN  AND FAMILY HAD TO DO WITHOUT BUT  STEPHEN, THIS GOES ON INTO MY RETIREMENT NOW AND I BECAME A  WIDOW IN 2008 AND NOW WHEN MY  RETIREMENT CHECKS GO IN THE BANK  I GET 40% LESS THAN I SHOULD. AND IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE  ENDS MEET. AND I'M JUST THE TIP OF THE  ICEBERG. THE UNITED STATES IS FULL OF  WOMEN IN THE SAME SITUATION AND  SO MANY OF THEM HAVE TO MOVE  INTO HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN.
Stephen: THIS HAS BECOME A  VERY POPULAR LAW WITH WOMEN--  FOR WHATEVER REASON. (LAUGHTER)  AND THEY'RE A COVETED DEMOCRAT  GRAPHIC OF VOTERS IN THIS  ELECTION. MITT ROMNEY IS NOT AGAINST THIS  LAW, RIGHT? HE SAID -- HE SAID HE'S NEITHER  FOR IT NOR AGAINST IT SO WE CAN  ASSUME HE'S FOR IT, RIGHT?
HE'S NOT SAID ANYTHING. HIS STAFFER TOLD THE REPORTER  "WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU" AND SO  FAR THEY HAVE NOT GOT BACK TO  US.
Stephen: WELL, MAYBE HE'S  JUST TRYING TO KEEP A GREAT  SURPRISE. (LAUGHTER)  LIKE WHEN HE GETS INTO OFFICE  HE'LL SIGN A LAW GIVING YOU  TWICE THE PAY.
I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: WHAT IF WOMEN JUST  HOLD OUT AND JUST SEE WHAT'S  BEHIND DOOR NUMBER MITT. (LAUGHTER)
I WOULDN'T ADVISE THAT.
Stephen: ARE YOU PRESENTLY  WORKING?
NO.
Stephen: WILL NO ONE HIRE YOU  BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU'LL SUE  THEM?
YOU GOT IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LILLY LEDBETTER. THE BOOK IS "
