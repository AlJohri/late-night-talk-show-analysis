TONIGHT I TELL VIEWERS ABOUT THE HOME STATE OF THOMAS JEFFERSON, YES, SANTA CLAUS THERE IS A VIRGINIA, THEN I CHECK IN ON THE STATE OF RACISM IN AMERICA AFTER DOUBLE-CHECKING THAT MY CAR DOORS ARE LOCKED. AND MY GUEST E.O. WILSON IS A BIOLOGIST WHO SAYS HUMANS HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM ANTS. BUT WHEN I EXCRETE AN ODOR TRAIL TO FIND MY WAY HOME I GET ARRESTED. SONY HAS DEVELOPED A 185 TERRABYTE CASSETTE, FINALLY YOUR MIX TAPE CAN INCLUDE TWO PHISH SONGS. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I'M SORRY, I APOLOGIZE, FOLKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I APOLOGIZE. I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET PAST YOUR CHANTING AM I JUST THOUGHT I COULD SNEAK PAST THE CASTLEGATES OF YOUR LOVE BUT YOU STOPPED ME, THANK YOU. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OBSESSED WITH KNOWING WHAT DAY IT IS, THEN YOU KNOW THAT TODAY IS CINCO DE MAYO. WHICH THIS YEAR IS LANDING ON THE 5th OF MAY. (LAUGHTER) NOW UNFORTUNATELY, ONE PERSON IS MAKING A CINCO DEMOCKERY OF AMERICAN VALUES. CASA MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, IN HONOR OF THIS YEAR'S CINCO DE MAYO SHE RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING QUOTE THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR COUNTRY OF AMERICA'S LATINO COMMUNITY THAN BY ENACTING COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. OH, THAT IS RIDICULOUS. WE ALREADY DO SO MUCH ON CINCO DE MAYO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. WE DRINK NOT UNO BUT DOS EQUIS. AND MANY AMERICANS ARE EATING TACOS TODAY, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT TUESDAY. (LAUGHTER) AND FRANKLY, LATINOS SHOULD BE DEEPLY INSULTED THAT PELOSI LUMPED ALL OF YOU TOGETHER UNDER A MEXICAN HOLIDAY. THAT'S WHAT THE PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE IS FOR. (LAUGHTER) BUT PELOSI REALLY STEPPED IN IT WHEN SHE SAID THE TIME IS NOW FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO EMULATE THE BRAVERY DEMONSTRATED IN THE BATTLE OF PUEBLA. EXCUSE ME? THE BRAVERY OF THE BATTLE OF PUEBLA? ONLY AMERICAN BATTLES CAN BE BRAVE, MADAME. MAY I REMIND YOU THE BATTLE WAS BETWEEN THE MEXICANS AND THE FRENCH. WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU ROOTING FOR IN THAT FIGHT, NANCY? MEXICAN COMMANDER IGNACIO ZARAGOZA OR FRENCH COUNT CHARLES LORENCEZ? DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE FRENCH CAME BACK AND CRUSHED THE MEXICANS LIKE GUACAMOLE IN THE SECOND BATTLE INSTALLING ARCHDUKE MAXIMILLIAN AS EMPEROR OF MEXICO WHO EVIDENTLY NARROWLY ESCAPED A CANNON SHOT TO THE BEARD. IF NANCY PELOSI REALLY WANTED REPUBLICANS TO GET BEHIND IMMIGRATION REFORM SHE SHOULD HAVE INVOKED AN AMERICAN BATTLE WITH MEXICO LIKE THE ALAMO. I'M PRETTY SURE WE WON THAT ONE, OTHERWISE WHY WOULD WE KEEP REMEMBERING IT. (LAUGHTER) NOW HEY, FOLKS, I WILL BE WITH YOU IN JUST A MOMENT. I JUST NEED TO PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON THIS "LITTLE MERMAID" I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON HERE. OH, PRETTY HAIR. PRETTY HAIR. I COULDN'T FIND ONE, A GOOD ONE AT THE STORE SO I DUCT TAPED THE TOP HALF OF A BARBIE BRAND FASHION DOLL TO THE TAIL OF A HERRING. (LAUGHTER) SHOULD REALLY KEEP THAT REFRIGERATED. I'M HOPING THAT NORFOLK, VIRGINIA, WILL ADD THIS TO THE 130 MERMAID STATUES ALREADY ON DISPLAY IN THE CITY. AND COINCIDENTALLY NORFOLK CAN BE FOUND IN THE 77th INSTALLMENT OF MY 434 PART SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. TONIGHT VIRGINIA'S THIRD, THE FIGHTIN THIRD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE THIRD DISTRICT ABUTS JAMESTOWN, AMERICA'S FIRST PERMANENT ENGLISH SETTLEMENT WHERE COLONIST JOHN SMITH WAS CAPTURED BY THE POWHATAN INDIANS AND HAD HIS LIFE SAVED BY POCAHANTAS AND SAVED AGAIN CENTURIES LATER BY POCAHANTAS ON ICE. THE 3RD IS ALSO WHERE PATRICK HENRY UTTERED "GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH" WHILE THOMAS JEFFERSON BRAVELY STOOD AT HIS SIDE AND SAID "I DON'T KNOW THAT GUY." DURING THE CIVIL WAR RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, WAS THE CAPITOL OF THE CONFEDERACY. TODAY THAT TITLE BELONGS TO CLIVEN BUNDY'S RANCH. THE THIRD ALSO HOUSES THE NORFOLK NAVAL STATION, AMERICA'S LARGEST NAVAL BASE. FUN FACT, I JUST GAVE AWAY THE LOCATION OF AMERICA'S LARGEST NAVAL BASE. (LAUGHTER) THE THIRD BORDERS THE CHESAPEAKE BAY, SOMETIMES THE BAY'S POLLUTION CAUSES OXYGEN SEEKING CRABS TO MASS AT THE SHORELINE IN WHAT IS CALLED A CRAB JUBILEE WHICH IS A LITTLE LIKE CALLING A SYRIAN RELIEF CAMP A REFUGEE PARTY ZONE. (LAUGHTER) AND JUST WHO HAS THE RICH BUTTER MILK BISCUITS TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT, NONE OTHER THAN 11 TERM CONGRESSMAN BOBBY SCOTT. I SAT DOWN WITH HIM IN HIS WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSMAN THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH ME TODAY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU. CONGRESSMAN ROBERT SCOTT-- DO YOU HAVE A LAST NAME?
YES, SCOTT.
Stephen: ROBERT SCOTT SCOTT.
NO, ROBERT CORTEZ SCOTT.
Stephen: OH, ROBERT CORTEZ SCOTT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: ARE YOU HISPANIC?
NO, MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FILIPINO.
Stephen: OH, I'M SORRY, ALOHA, TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTIN THIRD.
IT'S A GREAT DISTRICT. IT STARTS IN CAPITOL RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AND GOES DOWN TO HAMPTON ROAD.
Stephen: RICHMOND HAS BEEN RANKED THE THIRD MOST TATTOOED CITY IN THE UNITED STATES. CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU HAVE ANY TATS.
I DON'T-- .
Stephen: I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NOT WHERE I CAN SEE BUT FROM THE NECK DOWN, LIKE A --
DID YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING AN AMERICAN FLAG TATTOO TO SHOW YOUR LOVE FOR AMERICA AND YOUR LOVE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS.
NO.
Stephen: NO? WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST THE AMERICAN FLAG?
I DON'T ANYTHING AGAINST THE AMERICAN FLAG.
Stephen: YOU WON'T PUT IT ON YOUR BODY. I HAVE A TATTOO OF RONALD REAGAN WEARING A COWBOY HAT RIDING A PANTHER COMING UP OUT OF MY BUTT CRACK.
I WILL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
Stephen: I NOTICE A LOT OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE GOVERNMENT JOBS. SO NOT A LOT OF REAL JOBS.
THEY ARE REAL JOBS.
Stephen: THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT CREATE JOBS THIS IS AN ACCEPTED FACT.
SOME PEOPLE WILL THINK THAT UNTIL THEY MEET SOME GOVERNMENT-- NEED GOVERNMENT HELP.
Stephen: THAT GOVERNMENT HELP, ASSISTANCE, A HANDOUT.
WHEN YOU NEED YOUR MAIL DELIVERED YOU WANT GOVERNMENT JOBS, AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS THOSE ARE GOVERNMENT JOBS.
Stephen: I'M NOT BIG ON AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. I LET THE FREE MARKET DETERMINE WHO GETS TO LAND.
EVERYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE THE TO SEE AIRCRAFT BEING CONTROLLED SO THEY ARE NOT BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER.
Stephen: IN 2014 ARE YOU WILLING TO SIT THERE AND SAY BIG GOVERNMENT, LET'S KEEP ALL THE GOVERNMENT JOBS THAT IS YOUR --
BIG GOVERNMENT, LET'S PROTECT THE AIRSPACE, BIG GOVERNMENT LET'S PROTECT THE WATER SO THAT WHEN YOU DRINK WATER, IT'S SAFE.
Stephen: WHY NOT JUST BUY BOTTLED WATER.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO BUY BOTTLED WATER BUT YOU WANT THE TAP WATER TO BE SAFE.
Stephen: OF COURSE YOU WANT SAFE WATER BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. YOU'RE TURNING THE SAFETY NET INTO A HAMMOCK BY TURNING ON THE TAP AND DEPENDING ON SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A REAL JOB DETERMINE WHETHER THAT WATER IS CLEAN OR NOT. AND HE'S TASTED IT BEFORE I DO. I DON'T WANT TO TASTE SOMEBODY ELSE'S BACKWASH.
THAT IS EXACTLY THE DEBATE THAT'S GOING ON IN WASHINGTON TODAY.
Stephen: YOU HEARD OF GLOBAL WARMING.
I HAVE.
Stephen: DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS HAPPENING.
I DO.
Stephen: YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SEA LEVEL RISING.
NORFOLK IS ONE OF THE SECOND MOST AT RISK FOR SEA LEVEL RISE.
Stephen: THE WATER IS COMING TO ATTACK US AND YET YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE WATER. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
I DON'T-- .
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE. IF IV'E KNOCKED YOU BACK ON YOUR HEELS THAT IS OKAY. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN THESE INTERVIEWS. THIS IS YOUR 11th TERM IN CONGRESS. YOU WERE FIRST ELECTED IN 1993 SO YOU ARE --
I WAS ELECTED IN '92.
Stephen: '92.
YOU GET ELECTED IN 1 YEAR AND START SERVING THE NEXT. THEY SAY IF YOU HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF CONGRESS SINCE 1993, I WAS ELECTED IN 1992.
Stephen: BUT IT SAYS '93 HERE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF CONGRESS SINCE 1993.
Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. (LAUGHTER) OKAY SO MUCH OF YOUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON JUSTICE AND EDUCATION REFORM.
MY POLICY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE CRIME AND A LOT OF THE GUT REACTIONS ACTUALLY INCREASE CRIME. A LOT OF THINGS SOUND GOOD, SOUND LIKE THEY ARE TOUGH ON CRIME.
Stephen: THREE STRIKES, YOU'RE OUT.
THAT DOES NOTHING TO REDUCE CRIME.
Stephen: IT INCREASES PRISON TERMS. IT INCREASES PRISON TERMS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: THEREFORE IT REDUCES CRIME BECAUSE THE CRIMINALS ARE WHERE, IN JAIL?
WELL,
Stephen: CHECKMATE
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE POLICY. UNLESS IT RHYMES OR IT SOUNDS TOUGH
Stephen: PEOPLE DON'T THINK YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF.
RIGHT.
Stephen: BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST RHYMING.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH RHYMES IS THAT IT CREATES AN ILLUSION THAT ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CRIME WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING NOTHING ABOUT CRIME OR EVEN INCREASING THE CRIME RATE.
Stephen: THE FACT IS RHYMING IS WORKING. WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH.
BY FAR.
Stephen: U.S.A. NUMBER 1.  (LAUGHTER)
IF YOU WANT TO APPLAUD, THAT'S OK
I WANT PEOPLE NOT TO COMMIT CRIMES IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IF YOU INVEST IN PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION YOU HAVE LESS INCIDENCE OF CRIME AND WILL SAVE MONEY IN THE PROCESS.
Stephen: YOU ALMOST RHYMED THERE. YOU SAID PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION, THIS IS WHAT I'D LIKE TO PUSH AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND. PUT YOUR RHYMES INTO YOUR CRIME TALK, PEOPLE DON'T THINK YOU ARE WALKING THE WALK.
THAT IS A NICE RHYME.
Stephen: MY RHYMING IS SUBLIME, I CAN RHYME ON A DIME, SEE I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU. YOU HAVE GOT TO HELP ME OUT. YOU HAVE TO DROP A FEW LINES YOURSELF IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH CRIME POLICY THAT IS WHY WE ARE PUSHING SO HARD FOR, EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH, YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES, AT THE EVIDENCE. AND YOU SUPPORT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WORK RATHER THAN THINGS THAT-- .
Stephen: MAKE YOU SEEM LIKE A JERK.
I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH ME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: GOOD TO BE HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LET'S PUT THE THIRD UP ON THE BIG BOARD. OH, IT LOOKS LIKE UNION TROOPS BURNED RICHMOND TO THE GROUND AGAIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
