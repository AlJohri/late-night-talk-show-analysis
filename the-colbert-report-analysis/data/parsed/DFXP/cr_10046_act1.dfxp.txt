Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," THANK YOU FOR JOINING US LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT. WE'VE GOT TONS OF NEWS TO REPORT. OBVIOUSLY THE BIG STORY EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT, YOU GOT THE LATEST FROM IRAQ, PROBLEMS IMPLEMENTING OBAMACARE, THERE IS A NEW BUDGET DEAL COMING, PLUS REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS TO MODIFY THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT! SO WITH THAT, THIS IS "THE SPORT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FIRST UP, FOLKS, BASEBALL. NATION, I'M AS MAD AS A MAN WHO'S TOO ANGRY TO FINISH HIS SIMILES. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE MY FAVORITE ATHLETE HAS BEEN DEALT A GROSS MISCARRIAGE OF SPORTS JUSTICE. YANKEES THIRD BASEMAN A-ROD. NOW, A-ROD'S A FRIEND. WE USE THE SAME ARTIST TO PAINT US AS CENTAURS, GOOGLE IT. TO ME THIS GUY IS NOT JUST A-ROD HE'S THE-ROD. AND IT MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL TO SEE HOW HE'S BEING PERSECUTED.
A-ROD HAS BEEN SHUT OUT OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL'S ENTIRE 2014 SEASON. 162 GAMES. NOT GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY POST-SEASON GAMES.
NEW YORK YANKEES THIRD BASEMAN HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR THE ENTIRE 2014 SEASON FOR USING PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS.
Stephen: WHAT? THAT'S INSANE! 162 GAMES? HOLD ON A SECOND. MULTIPLIED BY HOW LONG EACH BASEBALL GAME LASTS -- HOLD ON, LET'S SEE HERE. UH-HUH. THAT'S 400 YEARS! BESIDES, FOLKS, I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD! NO.
FOR THE RECORD, HAVE YOU EVER USED STEROIDS, HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING SUBSTANCE?
NO.
DID YOU DO ANYTHING WRONG?
NO.
DID YOU DO ANY P.E.D.s?
NO.
Stephen: AND I BELIEVE HIM, FOLKS. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE HE'S USING PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS. ESPECIALLY IN THE PLAYOFFS. (LAUGHTER) SO, LISTEN, ULTIMATELY, WHAT IF HE DID USE DRUGS? IT'S THE CULTURE OF THE GAME! TO STAY COMPETITIVE, TODAY'S PLAYERS NEED A LITTLE SOMETHING-SOMETHING, GIVEN THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF THIS SPORT. I MEAN, THERE'S THE STANDING, THE SITTING, AND, HEY, THOSE CROTCHES AREN'T GOING TO SCRATCH THEMSELVES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE -- JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE IN FAVOR OF DRUGS, SO IS FOX NEWS BENCH WARMERS THE FIVE.
HE PROBABLY SUPPLIED A-ROD WITH PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS AND MAYBE HE DID SHOOT HIM UP. BUT I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOU'D SUSPEND THE GUY FOR A WHOLE YEAR. MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL CAME OUT AND SAID GUESS WHAT? WE'RE KIND OF OKAY WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA. SO ON ONE HAND THEY'RE OKAY WITH MEDICAL MARIJUANA. THE BUT GOD FORBID YOU USE A PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUG.
Stephen: WELL OF COURSE THE MLB SUPPORTS MARIJUANA USE HOW ELSE DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO PAY $18 FOR A HOT DOG? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FOLKS, I THINK THE BEST POINT ON THE FIVE WAS MADE BY THE BOTTOM OF THE FIFTH, GREG GUTFELD. JIM?
DRUGS ARE GOING TO EXIST AS LONG AS THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO USE THEM AND THE INCENTIVE IS TO WIN. IN EVERY JOB YOU DO IF THERE'S A DRUG THAT HELPS YOU, DO THE DAMN DRUG AND NO ONE SHOULD GET IN YOUR WAY AND STOP YOU.
Stephen: I AGREE. IF THERE IS A DRUG THAT CAN MAKE GREG GUTFELD DO HIS JOB BETTER, BY GOD, HE SHOULD DO THOSE DRUGS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE, KEEP LOOKING, BUDDY, THEY'RE GOING FIND A CURE. (LAUGHTER) SO LISTEN TO THE FIVE, KIDS, JUST DO DRUGS. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RECREATIONALLY, PROFESSIONALLY! I MEAN CASE IN POINT. YOU THINK I WIN ALL THESE AWARDS BECAUSE I'M GOOD AND I WORK HARD? PLEASE! I AM NOTHING BUT A FLESH SACK PROPPED UP BY THE WONDERS OF BIG PHARMA! (LAUGHTER) FOR STARTERS I TAKE STEROIDS JUST FOR THE TESTICLE SHRINKING. (LAUGHTER) LEFT UNCHECKED, MY BALLS WOULD KEEP GROWING LIKE BEAVER TEETH. (LAUGHTER) AND OBVIOUSLY I'VE GOT TO POP ADDERALL TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ME ARE TALKING. (LAUGHTER) I TAKE SOME AMBIEN BECAUSE I HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAKS. THEN I JUST HIT THE BASICS-- CENTRUM, SOMA, NEUROIN, THE SPICE, GLINT, GLIMMER, JIZADRINE THE WII, POWDERED RHINO HORN, THE BLUE, BONIVA, FLINTSTONE'S CHEWABLES, FLINTSTONE'S  SUPPOSITORIES, FRONT LINE FLEA AND TICK ON THE BACK OF MY NECK SO I CAN'T LICK IT OFF AND I'VE GOT A NUVARING UP IN THERE SOMEWHERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHERE, BUT I'M WALKING FUNNY. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, KIDS, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPERIMENT TO GET YOUR OWN COCKTAIL DIALED IN. MINE TOOK A LOT OF TRIAL AND ERROR-- TRIAL IN THAT I'VE BEEN ON TRIAL FOR TAKING BATH SALTS AND THEN ERROR OF ATTEMPTING TO EAT SOMEONE'S FACE. ONCE AGAIN, MY APOLOGIES TO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. (AUDIENCE REACTS) NEXT UP, FOLKS -- SHE'S FINE, SHE'S FINE. NEXT UP, FOLKS, WINTER SPORTS. THIS IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF THE EVERY FOUR YEARS BECAUSE THE WINTER OLYMPICS ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. NOW, I AM PROHIBITED FROM SHOWING YOU A GRAPHIC OF THE OLYMPIC RINGS DUE TO THREATS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT BUT I'VE GOT A WORK AROUND. JIMMY, JUST PUT UP FIVE INTERLOCKING MICKEY HEADS. THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THIS YEAR'S OLYMPIC GAMES ARE IN RUSSIA WHERE VLADIMIR PUTIN'S RECENT LAW BANNING ALL DISPLAYS OF GAY PROPAGANDA HAS GOTTEN THE RIGHTS-HUGGERS' UNITARDS IN A BUNCH. BUT PUTIN RECENTLY LANDED HIMSELF A HUGE SUPPORTER STATE SIDE, FOX NEWS YOUTH CORRESPONDENT PAT BUCHANAN. (LAUGHTER) IN AN OP-ED ON DOWNHALL.COM ENTITLED, "IS PUTIN ONE OF US?" BUCHANAN APPLAUDS PUTIN'S BELIEF THAT TO EQUATE TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS TO EQUATE GOOD WITH EVIL. AND WRITES "PUTIN MAY BE SEEING THE FUTURE WITH MORE CLARITY THAN AMERICANS STILL CAUGHT UP IN A COLD WAR PARADIGM." BUCHANAN IS RIGHT FOLKS. THE COLD WAR IS OVER. IN FACT, IF REAGAN WERE ALIVE TODAY HE'D BEEN SAYING THIS.
MR. PUTIN, BUILD A WALL TO KEEP OUT THE HOMOS! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BESIDES, GAY SUPPORTERS HAVE NOTHING TO WHINE ABOUT BECAUSE PUTIN RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT PRE-APPROVED RALLIES MAY BE HELD IN A DESIGNATED PROTEST ZONE. YOU HEAR THAT, GAYS? IF YOU WANT TO PROTEST, JUST REPORT TO THE GATED ENCLOSURE SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN POLICE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, COMRADE-O-TOLERANCE IS STAGING A SIT-IN AT HIS HOME PROTEST ZONE.
Stephen: PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL NOT BE HEADING TO THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN SOCHI, RUSSIA. NEITHER WILL VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, THIS, OF COURSE, SEEMS LIKE A NOT-SO-SUBTLE REBUKE TO RUSSIA'S ANTI-GAY LAWS. THE WHITE HOUSE INSTEAD PLANS TO SEND A DELEGATION THAT INCLUDES TENNIS GREAT BILLIE JEAN KING, WHO'S OPENLY GAY.
Stephen: ACTUALLY I THINK THEY MEAN TENNIS GREAT BILLIE JEAN KING WHO IS FORMERLY GAY. BECAUSE SHE WAS ON MY SHOW LAST YEAR AND I FLIPPED THE SCRIPT. (LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN DANCE, BABY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU WERE WATCHING ME BACKSTAGE.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU QUITE A BIT EVERY PLACE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. FIVE MINUTES ON MY SHOW AND BILLY JEAN KING WANTED TO SNAP INTO ME LIKE A SLIM JIM. I'M LIKE -- FOLKS, I'M LIKE A BIG STRAIGHT MAGNET THAT ERASES ANY GAY HARD DRIVE THAT I'M PUT NEXT TO. WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL BE PUT NEXT TO TENNIS LEGEND AND U.S. OLYMPIC DELEGATE, BILLY JEAN KING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
