WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY. WE'LL SEE IF HE REALLY IS LIKE A ROCK. PLEASE WELCOME ALAN MULALLY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY!
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. FANTASTIC. GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON. YOU ARE THE PRESIDENCY OF THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY, JUST LIKE YOU ARE AN ICON OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM:CONGRATULATIONS!  CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
DID YOU DREAM OF RUNNING A CAR COMPANY WHEN YOU WERE A KID.
WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THEN?
I STARTED OUT AS A BAG CHECKER.
Stephen: A BAG CHECKER?
YES. THE AT THE GROCERY STORE.
Stephen: REALLY?  DID YOU WANT TO BE THE CEO OF BAG CHECKERS?
NO. I DIDN'T. BUT I LOVED SERVING PEOPLE.
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE WE ARE COMING UP ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORIGINAL MUSCLE CAR.
THE MUSTANG.
Stephen: THE MUSTANG. LET'S SHOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WHEN I WAS A KID THIS WAS A DREAM CAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT?  AND THAT IS THE MUSTANG. THAT SOUND RIGHT THERE. THAT'S ENOUGH. I WILL GET AN ERECTION. ALL RIGHT. NOW, THIS IS ONE OF THE COOLEST CARS EVER MADE. AND NOT ONLY WAS IT SORT OF COOL TO SEE ON THE STREET BUT IT WAS IN THE MOVIES. THIS IS WHAT STEVE MCQUEEN DROVE IN BULLET. WHY DO YOU THINK SOME CARS BECOME ICONS AND SOME CARS DO NOT?
WELL, I THINK, IN THIS CASE, THE MUSTANG JUST CHANGED THE WORLD IN 1965, BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST REAL SPORTS CAR THAT ALSO WAS A HIGH UTILITY, BECAUSE IT HAD TWO SEATS IN THE BACK, IT HAS HAD A TRUNK.
Stephen: OF COURSE IT HAD TWO SEATS IN THE BACK. IT WAS A MUSTANG. THE REASON IT BECAME AN ICON IS BECAUSE IT GOT YOU LAID. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: I HOPE YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN THAT OUT OF THE DESIGN.
NO, NO. IT IS STILL VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.
Stephen: OKAY. GOOD. NOW, WHEN WAS IT INTRODUCED?
IT WAS INTRODUCED IN 1965 AT THE WORLD'S FAIR RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
Stephen: IN SUPPORT OF THAT YOU ARE INTRODUCING A NEW 50TH ANNIVERSARY.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: OF -- THERE IS THE 20 -- THIS IS THE 2015 MUSTANG. UH WOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: MY QUESTION IS, THOUGH YOU STILL KNOW IT IS 2013, RIGHT?  AND YET WE ARE LOOKING AT THE 2015 MUSTANG.
YES.
Stephen: I ASSUME YOU HAVE COME HERE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT IN THE 2028 FORD TIME MACHINE. DOES IT HAVE A JET PACK?
THAT IS THE FUTURE. THAT IS THE FUTURE, YES.
Stephen: WE SHOULD HOPE SO.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: NOW, SPEAKING OF CARS OF THE FUTURE, YOU GUYS, LET'S TALK ABOUT CARS OF THE PAST AND CAR COMPANIES OF THE PAST.
YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE BACK IN THE OLD AUTO BAILOUT YOU ARE THE ONLY ZERO COMPANY THAT DIDN'T TAKE A BAILOUT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: GM AND CHRYSLER HAD TO BE BAILED OUT. WHAT IS IT ABOUT FORD AND ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE YOU GUYS IS THAT YOU ARE CAPITALISTS UNLIKE THOSE BOLSHEVIKS OVER AT GM AND CHRYSLER. COMRADE!  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THOSE GUYS SUCKING ON THE GOVERNMENT TEAT?
ISN'T IT BETTER FOR THEM TO BE WHIPPED OUT OF THE GENE POOL?
WELL, STEPHEN, CLEARLY THE UNITED STATES WAS IN A VERY, VERY TENUOUS SITUATION, SO EVEN THOUGH WE BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM WE ACTUALLY WENT AND TESTIFIED ON BEHALF OF OUR BANKRUPT COMPETITORS, I THINK WE DID THE RIGHT THING FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AT THE TIME. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: HOW ABOUT DETROIT NOW?  HOW DO WE SAVE DETROIT?
I WOULD SAY.
Stephen: THEY JUST DECLARED BANKRUPTCY?  HOW DO YOU PAY OFF THAT DEBT?  YOU ARE STILL IN MICHIGAN.
DEARBORN.
TEN, 20 MILES FROM DETROIT?  WHAT DO WE DO?  DO WE PAY OFF THE DEBT BY JUST PULLING THE GOLD FROM THE PENSIONERS OR DO WE JUST LET THE GREAT MOAT RECLAIM DEDETROIT?  WHAT DO WE DO?
I THINK THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING AND ADDRESSING ALL OF THE AREAS OF CONCERN, EVERYBODY HAS TO PULL TOGETHER AND DEVELOP A BETTER PLAN. THE THING ABOUT FORD, THOUGH, STEPHEN IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT INSIDE DETROIT ITSELF WE ARE VERY CLOSE AS YOU SAID AND ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE THERE, OUR SUPPLIERS ARE THERE AND BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR PRODUCTS WE ARE ACTUALLY GROWING PROFITABLY AND HIRING 15,000 NEW EMPLOYEES, WHICH IS THE BEST WE CAN DO TO HELP DETROIT.
Stephen: NOT UNION, THOUGH, YOU ARE NOT HIRING UNION, ARE YOU?
YES A LOT ARE REPRESENTED BY UNION.
UNIONS ARE WHAT ARE DESTROYING AMERICA DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?  IT IS IN THE UNION CHARTER, DESTROY AMERICA. DENTAL COVERAGE AND DESTROY AMERICA.
WELL, AS YOU WELL KNOW, UNIONS SIGNED THESE AGREEMENTS OVER THE YEARS AND WE ENDED UP NOT BEING COMPETITIVE IN FORD'S CASE WE WORKED TOGETHER AND WANTED TO HAVE A COMPETITIVE I HAVE AND COMPETE WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD SO WE REDID ALL THE AGREEMENTS AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE BRINGING PRODUCT BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AND COMPETING WITH THE BEST IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH THE NEW ROLLOUT. I LOVE IT. ALAN MULALLY, CEO OF FORD MOTOR COMPANY, THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MUSTANG. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK!
