OKAY.
STEPHEN: AND QUANTUM PHYSICS, A PARTICLE CAN BOTH BE THERE AND NOT.
RIGHT.
STEPHEN: AND THEY CAN BOTH BE TRUE.
RIGHT. BY THE WAY, I'M LOST.
STEPHEN: THAT'S THE WAY I AM WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. HOW CAN SOMEONE BE BOTH IDENTIFIABLE AS A MAN BUT SELF-IDENTIFY AS A WOMAN THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. HOW CAN BOTH BE TRUE?

STEPHEN: AND YOU ARE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I HAVE BEEN INFORMED TO ASK PEOPLE HOW THEY SELF IDENTIFIED. HOW DO YOU SELF IDENTIFY?
JEFFREY TAMBOR, SON OF BARNEY AND EILEEN TAMBOR, I AM FOR THE PURSUIT OF FREEDOM, AUTHENTICITY AND HAPPINESS.
STEPHEN: AND YOUR GENDER? (APPLAUSE) HOW DO YOU --
MY DAUGHTER IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND I SAID, HONEY, THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THIS IS THE WOMAN WHO'S IN TRANSITION, AND SHE SAYS, DADDY, I GET IT. SEVEN YEARS OLD, SHE SAYS, DADDY, SHE'S MORE COMFORTABLE BEING A WOMAN. (APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: I'M GOING TO GET THERE.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THERE.
STEPHEN: I'M FIRST TO ADMIT I'M A CIS HETERO(BLEEP). CAN I ASK A SERIOUS QUESTION? IS THERE GOING TO BE A HELL BOY 3?
OH, MY GOD! THERE'S ACTUALLY TALK OF A HELL BOY 3, BUT THEY BETTER HURRY, OR I'M GOING TO BE IN A WALKER.
