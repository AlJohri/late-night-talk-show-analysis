Stephen: TONIGHT, OBAMA GOES IT ALONE ON IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER DEMOCRATS LEFT IN WASHINGTON. THEN A VICTORY IN CLASS WARFARE -- YOU WILL NEVER GUESS WHICH 1% CAME OUT ON TOP. AND MY GUEST, EVA LONGORIA, IS HERE WITH A NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT LOW-WAGE FARM WORKERS. OR AS I CALL THEM, LETTUCE INTERNS. JOSÉ CANSECO IS SELLING HIS AMPUTATED FINGER ON eBAY BECAUSE, THANKS TO STEROIDS, HE'S ALREADY GROWN  A NEW ONE BACK. THIS IS  "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SORRY FOLKS, I'VE JUST GOT TO DO THIS FIRST. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, EVERYBODY. THE SHOW WILL START IN JUST ONE MINUTE. THE SHOW WILL START IN JUST ONE MINUTE. I'M SURE IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS, YOU KNOW A BIG FREEZE IS MOVING IN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. I'M JUST PUTTING DOWN SOME SALT. DON'T NEED A LAWSUIT ON MY HANDS. ALRIGHT, THERE YOU GO. AND A LITTLE PEPPER.  RIGHT THERE, JUST A TASTE. JUST A TASTE, THERE YOU GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 'CUZ THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS FRIGHTFUL.
200 MILLION AMERICANS ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COLD SNAP TODAY.
50% OF THE COUNTRY BLANKETED IN SNOW.
THIS MINNESOTA LAKE TURNED TO SOLID ICE -- A RARE PRE-THANKSGIVING DEEP FREEZE.
FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN ALL 50 STATES.
Stephen: ALL 50. EVEN HAWAII -- WHERE ALOHA NOW MEANS "HELLO," "GOODBYE," AND "MY NIPPLES COULD SLICE PINEAPPLE ." AND DO NOT CONFUSE THIS COLD SNAP WITH LAST YEAR'S POLAR VORTEX. THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
THE RECORD-BREAKING POLAR PLUNGE.
POLAR PLUNGE.
Stephen: POLAR PLUNGE, WHICH IS NOT JUST A ROCKIN' NEW FLAVOR OF CAPRI SUN. NO, IT'S SOMETHING EVEN BETTER -- A REASON TO IGNORE GLOBAL WARMING.
WHILE THE PRESIDENT FOCUSES ON GLOBAL WARMING, MORE BRUTALLY COLD WEATHER IS HITTING ACROSS MUCH OF THE COUNTRY AGAIN TODAY.
THE PREVAILING SENTIMENT IS WE'VE GOT TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING. WE'RE FREEZING. WE HAVE RECORD COLD. WE'RE NOT IN GLOBAL WARMING. JUST FIX IT IN YOUR MIND, FOLKS.
Stephen: HE'S RIGHT. WHEN IT COMES TO GLOBAL WARMING, FIX IT IN YOUR MIND. 'CUZ WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT IN REALTY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IT IS WELL KNOWN BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION FOR YEARS. WELL, NOW APPARENTLY HE WANTS TO ROLL IT UP, STUFF IT WITH RICE AND BEANS, AND SMOTHER IT IN PICANTE SAUCE.
A SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PLANNING TO ANNOUNCE A TEN-PART PLAN TO OVERHAUL IMMIGRATION POLICY THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA VOWING TO GO IT ALONE ON IMMIGRATION.
HE PLANS TO PASS EXECUTIVE ACTION IMMIGRATION AMNESTY JUST BY HIMSELF, WITHOUT CONGRESS.
Stephen: YEAH, HOW DARE HE TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS IMMIGRATION, BY HIMSELF? HE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH CONGRESS, TO DO NOTHING, TOGETHER. EVEN WORSE, THE RUMOR IS HE'S GOING TO OVERHAUL THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THROUGH FIAT. FIAT? IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG -- YOU HAVE TO ORDER NEW PARTS FROM ITALY. IT'S MADNESS AND JUST LISTEN TO WHAT'S IN OBAMA'S PLAN. IT WOULD "PROTECT UP TO 5 MILLION UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRANTS FROM THE THREAT OF DEPORTATION AND PROVIDE MANY OF THEM WITH WORK PERMITS. THEY GET TO STAY AND RECEIVE WORK PERMITS! NOW THEY'RE COMING FOR THE JOBS THEY ALREADY HAVE! THIS WHOLE PLAN CHEAPENS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN... BECAUSE "THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WOULD TAKE 50% OFF THE FEE FOR THE FIRST 10,000 APPLICANTS." 50% OFF. OBAMA'S JUST TOSSING AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP IN THE BARGAIN BIN WITH THE STALE HALLOWEEN CANDY AND UNBAGGED UNDERWEAR. PLUS, OBAMA'S GOING TO "EXPAND VISAS FOR FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS WITH HIGH-TECH SKILLS." WHY FOREIGNERS? AMERICANS ALREADY HAVE PLENTY OF HIGH-TECH SKILLS. LIKE OPERATING AN iPhone TO CONTACT A CALL CENTER IN INDIA. WELL, THANK GOD THIS PLAN LEAKED! BECAUSE NOW CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS CAN STOP IT.
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE PRESIDENT TOOTH AND NAIL IF HE CONTINUES DOWN THIS PATH. THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO GOVERN. OUR GOAL HERE IS TO STOP THE PRESIDENT FROM VIOLATING HIS OWN OATH OF OFFICE AND VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION. IT'S NOT TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS. THEY ARE ON THE TABLE.
Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT, OBAMA? ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE. THAT MEANS LAWSUITS, IMPEACHMENT, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, BOOTS ON THE GROUND, PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE NOTES ON THE FRIDGE. BUT MOSTLY, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CASH.
IF THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TRY TO USURP OUR AUTHORITY IN CONGRESS, I THINK WE NEED TO BITE BACK AND NOT GIVE HIM THE FUNDS TO DO THAT.
WE WILL USE THE POWER OF THE PURSE TO TRY TO PUSH BACK AGAINST HIS OVERACTIVE BUREAUCRACY.
THEY SHOULD HANDLE IT THROUGH DEFUNDING WHAT THEY CAN DEFUND -- KEEPING BACK MONEY FROM AREAS WHERE HE NEEDS MONEY TO CARRY OUT THESE ILLEGAL ACTIONS.
Stephen: YES, THE PRESIDENT IS REFUSING TO DEPORT THESE ILLEGALS, SO WE MUST CUT THE FUNDING TO PAY THE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS HE WON'T NEED TO NOT DEPORT THEM. IT'S LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID AND I REFUSED TO RAKE THE YARD, SO AS A PUNISHMENT MY PARENTS WOULDN'T BUY ME A RAKE. REALLY TAUGHT ME A LESSON. TO THIS DAY, I DON'T RAKE MY YARD. I PAY LUIS TO DO IT. I ASSUME HE'S A CITIZEN. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S A CITIZEN, HE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. AND I PAY HIM IN CASH. BUT HOW DOES THE LATINO COMMUNITY FEEL ABOUT ALL OF THIS TO FIND OUT WHAT THE GRANDE HISPANA-CHINOS THINK I TURN ONE LAST TIME TO MY MEXICAN COLLEAGUE, ESTEBAN COLBERTO!
HOLA, STEPHEN! BIENVENIDOS A LACOLBERTO REPORTO GIGANTE!
Stephen: ESTEBAN, MY FRIEND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IT IS BITTERSWEET TO KNOW THAT WE ARE BOTH ENDING OUR SHOWS.
SI, ES TRISTE. CHICAS, CHICAS. ES TRISTE.
Stephen: SO, MY DEAR FRIEND, EVERYBODY DOWN IN YOUR NECK OF THE CACTUS MUST BE THRILLED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.
PRESIDENTE OBAMA?
Stephen: SO WILL THIS MAKE LATINOS VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS  IN THE FUTURE?
Stephen: YES, BUT WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY IS --
Stephen: BUT IF THIS PLAN GOES INTO EFFECT, WILL YOU BE TAKING OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION HANDOUT?
Stephen: YOU CAN GET THOSE IN MEXICO?
SI. BUT I GOT MINE FROM PENN STATE.
Stephen: WHAT THE (BLEEP)?! ESTEBAN, YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?!
YES.
Stephen: THEN WHY DID YOU MAKE ME SUBTITLE YOU FOR NINE YEARS?
Stephen: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. SO THIS MEANS  YOU'RE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES?
Stephen: WELL, WHEREVER YOU GO, MY FRIEND I'LL MISS YOU.
Stephen: ESTEBAN COLBERTO, EVERYONE!
REGRESAMOS PRONTO.
