(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IT'S NO SURPRISE BUT I DO NOT TRUST THE MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERS WHEN I WANT RELIABLE NEWSPAPER I ALWAYS TURN TO MY LOCAL PAPERS LIKE THE STATEN ISLAND ADVANCE, THE NUMBER ONE FORCE FOR FINDING OUT WHOSE GOOMAH WAS SEEN EATING GABAGOOL WITH SOME MOOK. LAST WEEK THE ADVANCE PUBLISHED A HEARTWARMING LETTER FROM A VIETNAM VETERAN WHO OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN WAITING TO RECEIVE A NEW WHEELCHAIR FROM THE VA. TWO YEARS SEEMS LOOK A LONG TIME BUT THEY'RE STILL FILING PAPERWORK FROM THE WHISKEY REBELLION. LET'S READ ALL ABOUT THIS STORY BY WATCHING THE TV.
MICHAEL SULSONA WENT TO A LOWE'S STORE TO GET FENCING FOR HIS YARD BUT AS HE WAS BROWSING THE BOLTS ON THE WHEELCHAIR SNAPPED, THE STORE WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE BUT THE GUY IN THE FENCE DEPARTMENT TOOK HIM TO SEE THE GUY IN THE BOLT DEPARTMENT. NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE WAS SITTING IN A LOWE'S PATIO CHAIR WHILE THREE GUYS FIXED HIS WHEELCHAIR.
THEY JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, I WASN'T LEAVING THERE UNTIL THE WHEELCHAIR WAS LIKE NEW. WHAT REALLY TOUCHED ME WAS WHEN I  THANKED THEM ALL AND THEY JUST LOOKED AT ME AND THEY JUST SAID  IT WAS THEIR HONOR.
THOSE GENTLEMEN MAY HAVE FIGURED THAT WHEELCHAIR BUT HEARING ABOUT IT, LOOSED A FEW BOLTS IN HERE. DEDICATED LOWES EMPLOYEES HAVE PROVEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOES EVERYTHING BETTER THAN THE GOVERNMENT EVER CAN. IN FACT, I DON'T SEE WHY DAMN STRAIGHT.
I DON'T SEE WHY ALL OUR VETERANS HEALTH ISSUES CANNOT BE HANDLED BY LOWES. WHY WAIT MONTHS TO HAVE THAT HIP REPLACED AT THE VA WHEN LOWES WILL FIX YOU UP IN MINUTES WITH DUCT TAPE, CHICKEN WIRE AND A SOCKET WRENCH SET. AND SURE, SOME OLDER VETS OUT THERE NEED MAJOR PROCEDURES LIKE HEART TRANSPLANTS BUT REALLY WHAT IS A HEART OTHER THAN A FOUNTAIN PUMP, ZIP TIED TO SPRINKLER AND A GARDEN HOSE. I BET THE GOOD FOLKS AT LOWES CAN ONLY HANDLE MENTAL HEALTH. THE WORST CASE OF PTSD IN THE WORLD IS NO MATCH FOR THIS ADORABLE FROG STATUE USING A DAISY FOR AN UMBRELLA. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAW GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR IN FALLUJAH. LOOK AT THAT GUY'S TUMMY. IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU HAPPY, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET BETTER. (LAUGHTER) SO LOWES, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THOSE WE ARE INSUFFICIENTLY THANKING FOR THEIR SERVICE. BUT I DO HAVE ONE CRITICISM, LOWES. YOUR BATHROOMS. THERE'S JUST NO DAMN PRIVACY. AND I HAVE YET TO FIND ONE TOILET THAT FLUSHES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
