Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST IS A PROFESSOR AND  ADVOCATE OF LONG DISTANCE  RUNNING. NIGH NIPPLES WILL START BLEEDING  HALFWAY THROUGH THE INTERVIEW. PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL LIEBERMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  DR. LIEBERMAN, THANKS SO MUCH  FOR COMING. ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE THE EDWIN  M. LEARNER OF PROFESSOR OF  BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AT HARVARD, AND YOU ALSO RUN THE SKELETAL  BIOLOGY LAB. TRUE?
I DO. I CONFESS.
Stephen:  WHAT IS THE  SKELETAL BIOLOGY LAB? THAT SOWNS LIKE SOMEONE--  SOMEONE'S PROFESSION RIGHT  BEFORE THEY'RE FIRED AND BECOME A SUPER VILLAIN. WHAT MONFROSTS ARE YOU READY TO  LET LOOSE ON MANKIND.
WE STUDY WHY THE HUMAN BODY  IS THE WAY IT IS?
Stephen:  BECAUSE GOD  WANTED IT THAT WAY.
EXACTLY.
Stephen:  THANK YOU. THIES SHORT INTERVIEW.
SINCE WE'RE INTERESTED IN THE  EVOLUTION OF THE BODY, MOST OF  THE REMAINS WE HAVE ARE FOSSIL  BONES. SO WE FOCUS A LOT ON THE  SKELETON. HENCE, THE SKELETAL BIOLOGY LAB.
Stephen:  YOU SAY RUNNING,  WALKING, THROWING, SWEATING?
SWEATING, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen:  I DON'T SEE  SHOWERING ON THAT LIST.
THERE IS A SHOWER DOWN THE  HALLWAY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT  OFFER RUN?
Stephen:  HOW ARE THOSE  RELATED, WALKING RUN, SWEATING.
HUMAN BEINGS ARE AMONG THE  BEST LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS IN  THE WORLD AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE SEE SEW GOOD IS WE'RE GOOD  AT SWEATING. IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE YOUR  FAMILY DOG FOR A RUN ON A HOT  DAY GLI WOULD NOT DO THAT, BUT GO AHEAD.
THERE'S A GOOD REASON YOU  SHOULDN'T BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO  RUN AT A REASONABLE SPEED YOU WOULD FORCE YOUR DPOG DOGTO  GALLUP EXPWSHT WAY IN WHICH  ANIMALS, LIKE YOUR DOG, COOL IS PANTING, SHORT, SHALLOW BREATHS. BUT FOUR-LEGGED ANIMALS CANNOT  GALLUP AND PANT AT THE SAME  TIME. SO THE POOR LITTLE DOGGY WILL  OVERHEAT IN ABOUT 10, 15 MINUTES  AND YOU'LL KILL IT. SO DON'T DO THAT. BUT, BUT, IMAGINE TWO MILLION  YEARS AGO YOU'RE A HUNTER IN THE  MIDDLE OF AFRICA. PEOPLE HAVEN'T INVENTED EVEN THE  SPEAR. THEY HAVEN'T INVENTED THE BOW  AND ARROW AND YOU WANT TO GET  DINNER FOR YOUR FAMILY. YOU CHASE AN ANIMAL, MAKE IT  GAPUL. THE ANIMAL HIDES IN THE BUSHES,  YOU TRACK TCHASE IT AGAIN, AND  YOU KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL THE ANIMAL ACTUALLY OVERHEATS AND  YOU CAN DILL CIL IT WITHOUT ANY  TECHNOLOGY.
Stephen:  CAN WE STILL DO  THIS? CAN I RUN DOWN AN ANTELOPE? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, WATCHING THE WAY YOU  RAN OVER HERE, YOU HAVE SUCH  GOOD FORM, I BET YOU WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM.
Stephen:  DO I?
ABSOLUTELY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  I'M WEARING  THESE-- THESE-- THESE TOE SHOES. THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL TOES. IT MAKES YOUR FOOT FEEL LIKE  HAND IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. I WANT TO PEEL A BANANA WITH  THESE THINGS. YOU SAY RUNNING BARE FOOTED OR  IF YOU HAVE TO USE SHOES  SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS BETTER THAN DOING IT WITH SHOES ON. WE PAY A LOT, YOU KNOW, FOR  OUR-- FOR OUR AIR JORDANS.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK WHAT  MATTERS IS HOW YOU RUN. AND YOU CAN RUN WELL IN BOOTS. YOU CAN RUN BARE FOOT. YOU CAN RUN IN SHOES. I THINK WHAT MATTERS --
Stephen:  CAN'T RUN IN  CLOGS. YOU CANNOT RUN IN CLOGS.
CLOGS ARE PRETTY POOR BUT  PEOPLE HAVE TRIED. THE POINT IS, WHEN YOU'RE BARE  FOOT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH  STUFF YOU CAN IN A SHOE. WHEN YOU ARE WEARING A SHOE  THERE'S A BIG, CUSHIONED HEEL,  AND IF YOU OVERSTRIKE, LAND WITH YOUR FOOT IN FRONT OF YOU IT  HURTS. BUT WHEN BARE FOOT IS HURTS MUCH  MORE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL --
Stephen:  THAT'S GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW. IF SOMETHING HURTS YOUR BODY IS  PROBABLY TELLING YOU SOMETHING  THAT YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT.
Stephen:  THE NEXT DAY  AFTER EXERCISING MY BODY OFTEN  HURTS. THAT'S WHY I STOPPED DOING IT.
THAT'S RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  SO, THE SO, GREAT THING ABOUT  BARE FOOT RUNNING IS IT'S LIKE A  FREE COACH. IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO RUN  LIGHTLY AND GENTLY, IF YOU'RE A  THUMP EAR SOMETIMES YOU GO RUNNING AND HEAR SOMEBODY CRASH  IN THE GROUND. THAT'S SOMEBODY ABOUT TO GO TO  THE HOSPITAL. THAT'S AN INJURY IN THE MAKING  BECAUSE THAT CRASH INTO THE  GROUND, THAT COLLISION SENDS A SHOCK WAVE UP YOUR BODY THAT  CAUSES DAMAGE TO YOUR BODY.
Stephen:  WHAT HAS IT  DEBATE TO US? HOW HAS IT CHANGED OUR BODIES  THAT WE ARE NATURAL RUNNERS?
IT CHANGES OUR BODIES FROM  HEAD TO TOE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE LARGEST MUSCLE  IN YOUR BODY IS?
Stephen:  MY TONGUE.
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE SITTING ON  IT, YOUR GLIEWTUS MAXIMUS, YOUR  BUTT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUTT OF A  CHAM PANS EYE, IT'S TINY. BUT HUMANS HAVE LARGE GLUTEUS  MAXIMUS. YOU CAN TEST THIS. GO AHEAD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THAT'S NIGHT  NOOIS. THAT'S NICE.
NOW RUN. NOW HOLD YOUR BUTT WHILE YOU  RUN. FEEL IT CRUNCHING UP? YEAH, EXACTLY. WHAT YOUR BUTT IS DOING, EVERY  TIME YOU HIT THE GROUND YOUR  BODY WANTEDS TO FALL FORWARD BUT YOU HAVE A BIG, INCREDIBLE  GLIEWTUS MAXIMUS THAT KEEPS YOU  FROM FALLING OVER.
Stephen:  IF YOU SEE  SOMEONE WITH A BIG BUTT PERHAPS  THE POLITE THING TO SAY IS, "WOW, ARE YOU REALLY  EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGED."  AND I CANNOT LIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
SO WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF  FEATURES IN OUR BODIES THAT MAKE  US GREAT AT RUNNING. WE HAVE SHORT TOES, AND SPRINGS  IN OUR FEET, AND SPECIAL SENSORY  APPARATUSES IN OUR EARS. WELL, THE INNER EAR.
Stephen:  WHAT ABOUT  CHEWING BECAUSE I AM AN EXPERT  CHEWER. YOU STUDY CHEWING. I'M A BIT OF A LONG DISTANCE  CHEWER. YOU CAN DO A FRUIT BY THE FOOT  LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. WHY IS OUR CHEWING DIFFERENT  THAN OTHER-- EVERYTHING CHOOSE.
THE AMAZING THING ABOUT US IS  HOW LITTLE WE DO IT. IF YOU WENT AND OBSERVED A BUNCH  OF CHIMPANZEES AND GORILLAS,  THEY WOULD RESPOND HALF A DAY  CHEWING. A HUNTER GATHERINGER EATING AN  ORIGINAL DIET WOULD SPEND 5% OF  THEIR DAY CHEWING, AND MIGHT BE A TYPICAL AMERICAN AND SPEND  THREE MINUTES CHEWING. WE'VE CHANGED OUR HEADS AND  SHRUNK OUR TEETH AND LOST OUR  SNOUTS AND EXCRETELY CHANGED --
Stephen:  WE HAVE SNOUT?
YES.
Stephen:  WHEN DID WE HAVE  A SNOUT?
ABOUT THREE MILLION YEARS  AGO, THE SAME TIME WE STARTED  RUNNING, START THROWING, THERE WAS A BIG SHIFT IN OUR BODIES.
Stephen:  IT WILL BE  FLOPPING AROUND THE WHOLE TIME.
ANYTHING NOT TIED DOWN WILL  BE FLOPPING AROUND WHEN YOU RUN. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE DEVELOPED  UNDERWEAR, AS WELL.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. DOCTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING ME. DR. DANIEL LIEBERMAN, "DON'T RUN  WITH SHOES ON."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
