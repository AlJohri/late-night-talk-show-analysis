WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. NOW NATION, I HAVE BEEN TRYING MY BEST TO IGNORE THE UKRAINE. (LAUGHTER) AND I MEAN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I REFUSE TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE HETMAN BOHDAN KHMELNYTSKY'S 1648 UPRISING AGAINST POLAND. UNFORTUNATELY EVENTS IN UKRAINE KEEP ANNEXING THE NEWS. ARMED PRO RUSSIAN MILITIAS HAVE SEIZED GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN SEVERAL UKRAINIAN CITIES, INCLUDING DONETSK, SLOVYANSK AND-- I'M GOING TO SAY CHIEF. AND OVER THE PAST WEEKEND THINGS WENT UKRAINE IN THE MEMBRANE.
UKRAINE LAUNCHED ITS STRONGEST ATTACK SO FAR ON PRO RUSSIAN MILITIAS.
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT IS LAUNCHING A LARGE SCALE ANTI-TERROR OPERATION TO RECAPTURE THE EASTERN CITY OF SLOVIANSK, THIS AS THE VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE ESCALATES.
Stephen: AND FOLKS, IF WE LOSE EASTERN UKRAINE TO RUSSIA, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE GOES SPRING BREAK IN ZAPORIZHIA, OBLASQT AND ALL OF THIS IS DUE TO THE ACTION OF ONE UNHINGED DICTATOR, BARACK OBAMA. THANKS IT HIS WEAKNESS PUTIN IS RUNNING WILD.
HE KEEPS TELLING PUTIN DON'T WORRY WE AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING MILITARILY.
HE IS READ BY THE REST OF THE WORLD AS WEAK.
IT IS REALLY A WEAK-- REALLY, I AM NOT SAYING THAT WITH ANY PARTISAN STUFF, I MEAN, BUT YOU KNOW, COME ON. THE PRESIDENT-- SEEMS UNWILLING TO TAKE STEPS THAT REALLY WOULD IMPRESS THE RUSSIANS.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU GOT TO IMPRESS THE RUSSIANS. AND HOW HARD COULD THAT BE. THEIR IDEA OF ENTERTAINMENT IS PUTTING THINGS INSIDE OTHER THINGS. THAT'S THEIR SEINFELD. BUT OUR COMMANDER IN WEAK JUST DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO STARE PUTIN DOWN. MEANWHILE PUTIN HAS SO MUCH SACK-SKI HE TOLD THE UKRAINIANS TO WITHDRAW ALL MILITARY UNITS FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY. THAT IS BOLD. THAT IS LIKE TELLING YOUR NEIGHBOR TO WITHDRAW TO THE COUCH BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ANNEX THE SOUTHEASTERN REGONS OF HIS WIFE. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHY THE PRESIDENT ISN'T JUST LISTENING TO THESE PEOPLE.
WHAT I WOULD DO IF I WAS THE ADMINISTRATION, I WOULD HELP ARM THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE SO THEY CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES.
THE UKRAINIANS WILL FIGHT AND FOR US NOT TO GIVE THEM THE CAPABILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IS WORSE THAN SHAMEFUL.
WE REALLY SHOULD PROVIDE SOME DEFENSIVE WEAPONRY.
I THINK IT IS TIME FOR  US TO CONSIDER ANTI-TANK WEAPONRY, ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONRY.
DEPUTY DOG IS RIGHT. WE MUST-- WE MUST ARM THESE ANTI-RUSSIAN FORCES WITH ROCKET LAUNCHERS. IT WORKED SO WELL WITH THE MUJAHIDEEN IN AFGHANISTAN. AND THAT NEVER BIT US IN THE ASS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
