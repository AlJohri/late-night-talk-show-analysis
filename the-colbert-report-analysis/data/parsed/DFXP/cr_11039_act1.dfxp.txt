Stephen: TONIGHT, I FIND A GREAT NEW WAY TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK, I'LL TELL YOU HOW FOR JUST $5. THEN THE PRESIDENT NORMALIZES RELATIONS WITH CUBA. NOW IF HE COULD JUST NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH FLORIDA. AND MY GUEST PHIL KLAY IS AN AUTHOR AND IRAQ VETERAN WHO JUST WON THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD. SO THAT'S ONE THING WE WON IN IRAQ. NASA HAS FOUND METHANE ON MARS, THOUGH I BELIEVE IT ORIGINATED FROM URANUS. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL â™ª
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR AND MRS AMERICA  AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. FOLKS THANK YOU SO MUCH I MR. SO GRATEFUL THAT OFF YOU ARE HERE, ALL OF YOU ARE AT HOME WATCHING. THIS IS MY LAST SHOW THAT ISN'T MY LAST SHOW. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE IS SO MUCH I'M GOING TO MISS. LIKE MY BELOVED STUDIO. I HAVE ENJOYED SO MANY MEMORIES HERE. I HAVE ALSO ENJOYED SO MANY BOTTLES OF BUD LITE LIME THAT THE MEMORIES ARE A LITTLE HAZY. BUT TOMORROW I WILL CONCLUDE MY FINAL BROADCAST. SAY MY FOND FAREWELL, ANGRY ADIOSES, AND MY LUKE-WARM LATERS AND WALK OUT. AND THEN EVERYTHING IN HERE WILL BE SHRED AND SOLD AS INDUSTRIAL MEAT FILLER TO A NATIONAL FAST-FOOD CHAIN. NOW I CAN'T SAY WHICH ONE. BECAUSE THEY ARE SPONSORS. BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT BA-BA-BA-BA, IT'S WHITE CASTLE. (APPLAUSE) I COULD GO FOR A CRATE. THE TWO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS ARE MY ICONIC DESK AND MY LEGENDARY FIREPLACE. AND YOU CAN WIN THEM, JUST GO TO OMAZE.COM/COLBERT AND DONATE $10 FOR EVERY CHANCE TO WIN. ALL PROCEEDS BENEFIT THE YELLOW RIBBON FUND AND DONORS CHOOSE. BUT DO IT QUICK. THE RAFFLE ENDS AT 3:59 EASTERN TIME TONIGHT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. JUST LIKE YOU DON'T REGRET ANY OTHER DECISION YOU HAVE MADE AT 4 A.M. AND NATION, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, IF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO IS SAD YOU WERE NEVER ABLE TO ATTEND MY SHOW IN PERSON, THANKS TO THE FRIENDLY NERDS AT GOOGLE MAP AND ELECTRIC ELECTRIC PULP, YOU CAN NOW TAKE VIRTUAL TOUR OF "THE COLBERT REPORT" SET. YOU CAN WALK RIGHT UP AND YOU CAN CLICK ON THE HISTORIC ARTIFACT ON PIE BOOK SHELF. FOR INSTANCE, YOU CAN SEE MY ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM ROBOTS. AND LEARN THAT I PUT THEM ON THE SHELF BACK IN 2005 TO MARK THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUPREME COURT BUSH V GORE RULING. NOT THE TOY I WANTED BUT THE STORE WAS ALL OUT OF HUNGRY HUNGRY SCALIAS. AND FOLKS, JUST BECAUSE I AM GOING DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONE. BECAUSE I ALSO COMMISSIONED FRENCH STREET ARTIST AND FRIEND OF THE SHOW JR TO PAINT A  MURAL ON THE ROOF OF MY STUDIO. JR'S WORK HAS APPEARED AROUND THE WORLD AND ESTABLISHED HIM AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STREET ARTISTS WORKING TODAY. HE COULD EVEN BE THE NEXT ME, I MEAN BANKSY. OOOH. WHOEVER BANKSY IS. NOW-- NOW THANKS TO JR THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL HERE ON TOP OF MY STUDIO TO CATCH YOUR EYE. SPECIFICALLY, MY EYE, IN SUPER GIGANTO ROOF VISION. LOOK AT THAT THING. NOW I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND THAT GIANT UNBLINKING EYEBALLS OF POWERFUL BEINGS ON TOP OF BUILDINGS HAVE GOTTEN A BAD RAP LATELY. BUT I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE YOU, THE NATION, MY WATCHFUL GAZE THAT PROTECTED YOU FOR SO LONG AGAINST THREATS THAT YOU COULD NOT SEE. ALSO I WANTED TO FREAK OUT PEOPLE STUCK IN A HOLDING PATTERN OVER LAGUARDIA. OF COURSE, OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS I HAVE ACQUIRED SO MANY MEANINGFUL KEEPSAKES LEFT OVER VACSA PRODUCTS, PINTS OF AMERICAN-CONE DREAM AND MY ONE OF A KIND MICHAEL STIPE WHO HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY SHELF OVER THERE FOR THREE YEARS.
