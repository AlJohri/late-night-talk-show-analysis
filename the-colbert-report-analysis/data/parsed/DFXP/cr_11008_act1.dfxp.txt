Stephen: TONIGHT, A PERSECUTED MINORITY FIGHTS BACK. WE'RE HERE. WE'RE UNABLE TO RHYME. ENJOY THAT FACT! THEN THE SPORTS WORLD IS ROCKED BY SCANDAL, OR AS IT'S SOMETIMES CALLED, FOOTBALL SEASON. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FORMER LED ZEPPELIN FRONT MAN ROBERT PLANT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'VE GOT BAD KNEES, SO I'LL ASK HIM IF THERE'S AN ESCALATOR TO HEAVEN. A NEW STUDY SAYS ON AVERAGE MEN NEED 7.8 HOURS OF SLEEP A DAY. REALLY, ON TOP OF THE 12 HOURS I GET EACH NIGHT? THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!" )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. HOLD ON A SECOND, FOLKS. FOLKS. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND. I JUST HAVE TO FINISH UP HERE. FOLKS, THE WHITE CHRISTIAN ESTABLISHMENT IS UNDER ATTACK AGAIN AND I AM JUST WHITTLING MYSELF A LITTLE PERSONAL DEFENSE CROSS, OKAY. AND IF ANYBODY COMES AT ME I CAN GIVE THEM A LITTLE SALVATION RIGHT IN THE JUGULAR. ALL RIGHT. IF THEY GET PAST THAT, I'VE GOT THIS KNIFE. FOLKS, I MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT, BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN, THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVES ARE COMING FOR THE MOST SACRED AMERICAN HOLIDAY IN THE FIRST HALF OF OCTOBER. JIM.
THE SEATTLE SCHOOL BOARD GIVING CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS THE BOOT? IN ORDER TO CELEBRATE THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE SEATTLE AREA, THE SCHOOL HAS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO HAVE THE SCHOOL OBSERVE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DAY EVEN THOUGH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL OBSERVE COLUMBUS DAY
Stephen: YES, SEATTLE IS REPLACING COLUMBUS DAY WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY. WHY? THEY DIDN'T DISCOVER AMERICA. AND IT WAS RIGHT UNDER THEIR FEET THE WHOLE TIME. HOW LAZY DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO NOT EVEN LOOK DOWN? AND THEY CLAIM-- THEY CLAIM IT'S ABOUT FIGHTING RACISM, BUT TELL THEM WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE PETER JOHNSON JR.?
IT'S A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STATEMENT THAT SAYS THAT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS WAS A VIOLATOR OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.
IT'S A SLAP.
IT'S AN ATTACK ON COLUMBUS DAY.
Stephen: YES, IT'S AN ATTACK ON COLUMBUS... DAY. ( LAUGHTER ) OR TO PUT IT IN A WAY THAT FIT MY PREEXISTING GRAPHIC, IT'S COLUMBUS DAY UNDER ATTACK.
MAMA MIA.
JESUS AND COLUMBUS SIDE BY SIDE, JUST LIKE THEY WERE ON THE "NINA" AND "PINTA." , OF COURSE, ST. MARY ON ON THE "SANTA MARIA."  NATION, I TAKE THIS ASSAULT ON COLUMBUS PERSONALLY. AS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT I IDENTIFY WITH AN ITALIAN EXPLORER EMPLOYED BY SPAIN. THIS IS THE GOOD KIND OF IMMIGRANT. I WOULD BE FINE WITH THE BORDER JUMPERS IF THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO FIND SPICE ROUTES TO ASIA. AND NOW SEATTLE WANTS ME TO FEEL GUILTY JUST BECAUSE COLUMBUS' ARRIVAL USHERED IN CENTURIES OF SUBJUGATION AND GENOCIDE. IT'S OVER. WE'RE MAKING AMENDS. JUST THIS WEEKEND WE'RE SENDING REBA TO MOHEGAN SUN. WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT? WORST OF ALL, IF THIS CATCHES ON, WE STAND TO LOSE ALL OF OUR MOST CHERISHED COLUMBUS DAY TRADITIONS. IT ALL STARTS BRIGHT BRIGHT AND EARLY ON COLUMBUS DAY MORNING WHEN THE KIDS RUSH DOWNSTAIRS IN THEIR P.J'S TO  SAY, "WE'RE OFF FROM SCHOOL! WHY DOES DAD HAVE TO WORK? THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT." NO, IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT AT ALL, KIDS. THEN WE GO TO THE PARADE AND EAT OUR WAY THROUGH SAUSEECH. ... I THINK RIGHT NOW, ALL OF US FEEL LIKE THAT ITALIAN GUY WHO PLAYED THAT INDIAN GUY IN THOSE POLLUTION COMMERCIALS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DAY BREAKS, YOU STAY BRAVE, IRON EYES. WE MAY FORGIVE, BUT WE MUST NEVER FUGHET ABOUT IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NATION, I LOVE INTERNET MEMES. THEY TEACH US ABOUT HUMAN NATURE. IN FACT, I LEARNED THAT FROM AN INTERNET MEME. AND A VIRAL VID-CLIP RECENTLY BURNING UP THE HASH-WEB IS AN ARGUMENT OVER THE WEATHER BETWEEN TWO TODDLERS.
IT'S SPRINKLING.
IT'S RAINING.
NO,.
IT'S SPRINKLING.
IT'S RAINING.
NO, IT'S SPRINKLING!
NO, IT'S RAINING.
MY MOM TOLD ME IT'S SPRINKLING!
IT'S RAINING.
NO--
YES, IT IS.
MY MOM TOLD ME IT WAS SPRINKLING, NOT RAINING.
MY MOM SAID IT'S RAINING.
Stephen: IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF HE-SAID-MOM-SAID, SHE-SAID-MOM-SAID. AND TALK ABOUT PRECOCIOUS. THESE KIDS ARE APPEALING TO AUTHORITY TO ARGUE OVER SOMETHING THEY ACTUALLY KIND OF AGREE ABOUT. JUST LIKE CABLE NEWS DOES. YOU SEE, MSNBC-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MSNBC SAYS IT'S SPRINKLING, FOX NEWS SAYS IT'S RAINING AND CNN SAYS WHATEVER, IT'S WET. THROW ANDERSON COOPER OUT THERE IN A TIGHT T-SHIRT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CIVIL SHOUTING MATCH ERUPTED INTO VIOLENCE.
IT'S RAINING! IT'S RAINING.
NO, IT'S NOT!
IT'S RAINING. OW!
ARE YOU OK? IT'S RAINING.
YOU POKED MY HEART ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I'M NOT CRYING. MY FACE IS JUST SPWINKLING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, JIM, LET'S GO OVER HERE. NATION, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME YOU TURN ON THE NEWS LATELY, YOU HEAR SOMETHING THAT SHOCKS YOU TO YOUR CORE. JUST THIS MORNING, I WAS HORRIFIED TO FIND OUT THERE IS AN ELECTION NEXT MONTH! AND THIS MIDTERM SEASON, THE BEST POLITICAL AD DOES NOT PROMOTE A CANDIDATE. IT PROMOTES A DEMONIZED MINORITY.  ♪  ♪
Stephen: YES, REPUBLICANS  ♪  ♪
Stephen: YES, REPUBLICANS ARE PEOPLE, TOO. I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH COURAGEOUS REBRANDING SINCE WHITE CASTLE'S "IT IS FOOD." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AD, VINNY MINCHILLO, HAS VAST EXPERIENCE MAKING REPUBLICANS SEEM HUMANS BECAUSE HE ONCE WORKED FOR MITT ROMNEY. VINNY SAYS HE MADE THE AD BECAUSE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, "I'VE BEEN CALLED EVERY NAME IN THE BOOK. IT'S BECOME SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO TALK ABOUT REPUBLICANS IN THE MOST EVIL TERMS POSSIBLE." OR TO PUT VINNY'S EXPLANATION ANOTHER WAY--
YOU POKED MY HEART.
Stephen: YOU POKED HIS HEART. AND JUST LIKE THAT LITTLE BOY, REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME COMMUNICATING WITH WOMEN. I TONIGHT KNOW WHY. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW WHY. REPUBLICANS CAN BE ANYBODY. THEY CAN BE WOMEN. MEN. BUT MOSTLY STOCK PHOTO MODELS. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT WE CHECKED WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHERS AND FOUND OUT THAT THE GUY IN FRONT OF THE PRIUS IS NOT A REPUBLICAN, AND LIVES IN SWEDEN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT THE REPUBLICAN READING THE "NEW YORK TIMES" DOES NOT AFFILIATE WITH EITHER PARTY AND IS ACTUALLY READING THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL." I JUST THINK THAT THIS AD, THIS JUST ADDS TO THE MESSAGE OF INCLUSIVENESS. REPUBLICANS CAN BE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE NOT. AS LONG AS WE CAN FIND THE RIGHT STOCK PHOTO, I BELIEVE REPUBLICANS CAN BE PEOPLE WHO DO YOGA ON PRODUCE. REPUBLICANS CAN BE WOMEN WHO EAT SALAD IN THE BATH TUB. REPUBLICANS CAN BE ASTRONAUTS WHO TAKE THEIR HELMETS OFF IN SPACE. REPUBLICANS-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) REPUBLICANS CAN GET TANGLED IN YARN. AND REPUBLICANS CAN EVEN BE TV HOSTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS. THAT'S RIGHT. I AM, I, STEPHEN COLBERT HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. FOR NINE YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU I'M AN INDEPENDENT CONSERVATIVE, BUT THAT WAS A LIE.
OOOHHH!
Stephen: I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT I WAS FOOLING EVERYONE. LAST NIGHT WHEN I FINALLY CAME OUT MY FAMILY AS OPENLY REPUBLICAN, THEY SAID THEY ALWAYS KNEW. THEY COULD TELL. THIS COMMERCIAL HAS INSPIRED ME TO ENCOURAGE ALL CLOSETED REPUBLICANS WHO ARE AFRAID TO BE THEMSELVES TO JOIN ME. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, PAPA BEAR.
AWNS, I'M AN INDEPENDENT. I'M AN INDEPENDENT, BUT I KNOW BOTH PARTIES PRETTY WELL.
I'M AN INDEPENDENT, I'M AN INDEPENDENT, ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY, GIRLFRIEND, WHATEVER HELPS YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHARF HELPS YOU CRY YOURSELF TO SLEET AT NIGHT. WE CAN TALK WHEN YOU'RE READY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
