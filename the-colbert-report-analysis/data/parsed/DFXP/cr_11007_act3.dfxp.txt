AT THAT TIME THERE WAS ONLY ONE CHANNEL.
STEPHEN: RIGHT. AND ALL OF THE TELEVISIONS WERE COAL FIRED, RIGHT, EXACTLY. BUT THOSE ARE SUPER BOWL NUMBERS. THAT'S THE KIND OF FAME PEOPLE ON TELEVISION TODAY CAN'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEING ON OUR TVS EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT, 10:00?
10:00 ON SATURDAY NIGHT. WELL, I LOVED IT VERY MUCH. WE HAD A GOOD TIME. WE-- WE DIDN'T WORK THAT HARD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
STEPHEN: REALLY? YOU DIDN'T WORK THAT HARD?
NO, WE DIDN'T, NO. IT WAS LIKE A SCHOOL SCHEDULE. I WORKED IN THE MORNING, LIKE, FROM 10:00 TO 3:00, PICKED THE KIDS UP, HOME FROM SCHOOL, WENT TO WORK THE NEXT DAY. I AVERAGED ABOUT 25 HOURS A WEEK WORKING. ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS )
STEPHEN: NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT.
YUP.
STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DIFFERENT ABOUT AMERICA NOW? IN THE HEYDAY OF YOUR SHOW, YOU WERE ON SATURDAY NIGHTS. AT ONE POINT IT "ARCHIE BUNKER MASH, MARY TYLER MOORE, BOB NEWHART AND YOU ON ONE SATURDAY NIGHT. IT WAS THE GREATEST NIGHT OF TELEVISION, GREATEST LINEUP EVER ON TELEVISION.
IT WAS ONE OF THEM, DEFINITELY, YEAH.
STEPHEN: WHY DO PEOPLE NOT WATCH TV ON SATURDAYS ANYMORE? WHAT'S DIFFERENT? WAS IT A SIMPLER TIME WHEN WE DIDN'T GO OUT WITH OUR HIP-HOP AND SAGGY JEANS ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
IT WAS APPOINTMENT TELEVISION. THAT'S WHEN THE FAMILIES GOT TOGETHER. TODAY, I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE SITCOMS TODAY, AND WHAT I THINK IS THEY'RE WRITTEN BY TEENAGED BOYS IN A LOCKER ROOM. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE F-BOMB.
EXACTLY. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY. AND IT'S SO EASY TO GET A LAUGH THAT WAY.
STEPHEN: I KNOW, ( BLEEP ) THOSE PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT I SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: ASIDE FROM, OBVIOUSLY, YOUR LEGENDARY CAREER ON TELEVISION, YOU'RE ALSO-- YOU'RE ALSO STAR OF THE STAGE, AND YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THE STAGE RIGHT NOW, AS YOU HAVE FOR DECADES NOW.
I'M ( BLEEP ) THRILLED ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN: YOU'LL BE STARRING IN "LOVE LETTERS" STARTING THIS SATURDAY AND THE NEXT MONTH. "LOVE LETTERS" IS A SWEET AND SIMPLE STORY. RATHER, A SIMPLY TOLD COMPLEX STORY OF PEOPLE'S LOVE EXPRESSED IN LETTERS.
YES, I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE WORKING WITH A WONDERFUL ACTOR WHOM I ADORE, BRIAN DENNEHY.
STEPHEN: BRIAN DENNEHY. THAT'S A GREAT GUY. VERY FORCEFUL. VERY POWERFUL. HE HAS A HEAD LIKE A SHOULDER OF BEEF.
HE'S GOT SHOULDERS LIKE JOAN CRAWFORD USED TO HAVE. ANYWAY, IT'S A STORY OF THIS COUPLE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP THAT SPANS ABOUT A 50-YEAR PERIOD. IT STARTS WHEN THEY'RE FIVE YEARS OLD --
STEPHEN:  SO YOU PLAY A FIVE-YEAR-OLD WHEN IT STARTS? YOU'VE GOT RANGE.
I'VE GOT A LOT OF RANGE.
STEPHEN: IT STARTS--
IT STARTS WHEN THEY HAVE CORRESPONDENCE. HE GOES TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY THAT SHE'S INVITED HIM TO. AND IT SPANS THEIR RELATIONSHIP OVER A 50-YEAR PERIOD. AND IT'S JUST A BEAUTIFUL STORY ABOUT THESE TWO PEOPLE.
STEPHEN: PEOPLE DON'T WRITE EACH OTHER LETTERS. SHOULDN'T YOU UPDATE A PLAY LIKE THIS TO ALL JUST BE TEXTING?
NO, NO.
STEPHEN: THE PLAY WOULD BE OVER IN EIGHT MINUTES.
NO, NO, WE WOULDN'T DO THAT. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WRITING LETTERS. IT'S ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP. NOW, I DO GET LETTERS. BECAUSE WE'RE ON YOUTUBE, SO OUR SHOW-- I'M GETTING LETTERS FROM KIDS-- YOU KNOW, THREE-HOLE, LINED PAPER FROM SCHOOL AND THEY'RE JUST ADORABLE.
STEPHEN: DO YOU WRITE THEM BACK?
YEAH. SOMETIMES IF THEY LEAVE A PHONE NUMBER AND I LIKE THE LETTER, I'LL CALL THEM.   ( APPLAUSE ) ONLY FOR KIDS, YOU KNOW. NOT-- I GO OUT ON THE ROAD SOMETIMES, AND I DO Q  & A.
STEPHEN: JUST LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. YOU STILL DO THE QUESTIONS?
I NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO ASK. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. AND NOT TOO LONG AGO THIS LITTLE BOY WAS IN THE SECOND ROW AND HE WAS RAISING HIS HAND. AND I SAID, HI, YES. HE SAID I HAVE A QUESTION. FIRST, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? ANDREW. I SAID HOW OLD ARE YOU ANDREW? AND HE SAID NINE. AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHO I AM? AND HE SAID, SURPRISINGLY, YES. ( LAUGHTER )
STEPHEN: WELL, CAROL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CAROL BURNETT, "LOVE LETTERS," BEGINNING THIS SATURDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
