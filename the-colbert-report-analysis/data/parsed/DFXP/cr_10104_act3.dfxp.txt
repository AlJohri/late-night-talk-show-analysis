( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE AN AWARD WINNING BLUES BAND. PLEASE WELCOME THE BLACK KEYS. THIS IS YOUR FOURTH TIME ON THE SHOW. THAT'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF RECORD.
THANKS FOR HAVING US BACK.
Stephen:  SO YOU GUYS, YOU SOLD MILLIONS OF ALBUMS, YOU HAVE SEVEN GRAMMYS. HOW MUCH MORE COLBERT BUMP DO YOU GUYS NEED, ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE HERE TO SUCK MORE MAGIC FROM ME.
MAGIC, WE NEED MORE MAGIC.
Stephen:  YOU'RE MAGIC VAMPIRES. WE CHECKED YOUR PROSTATE LAST TIME, REMEMBER THAT? HOW DID YOU WORKING WITH MY PROSTATE INFLUENCE YOUR NEW ALBUM WHICH IS CALLED "TURN BLUE."
THAT IS BROUGHT US INTO OUR BLUE PERIOD.
Stephen:  THIS IS AN IMAGE FROM MY COLONOSCOPY ON THE FRONT. AND THAT DARK AREA IN THE MIDDLE DOES NOT LOOK GOOD. I SHOULD HAVE THAT CHECKED OUT. OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE KNOWN FOR YOUR CONCISE BLUES ROCK. YOUR FIRST ALBUM HAD, LIKE, TWO-MINUTE SONGS ON IT, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Stephen:  THIS ONE HAS, LIKE, SEVEN-MINUTE SONGS ON IT WITH TWO-MINUTE GUITAR LEADS. IS THIS THE PHISH-IFICATION OF THE BLACK KEYS? DID TREY ANASTASIO GET TO YOU? WHY SO LONG?
I DON'T KNOW, APPARENTLY WE MADE THE RECORD WRONG ACCORDING TO THE PITCHFORKS. OUR PRIMITIVE NEANDERTHAL MINDS EXPANDED SLIGHTLY AND COULD CONTEXTUALIZE FOUR- TO SEVEN-MINUTE SONGS THIS TIME AROUND.
Stephen:  IT'S GOOD FOR D.J.s BECAUSE THAT'S ENOUGH TIME TO GO TAKE A DUMP. VERY GENEROUS OF YOU GUYS. THIS HAS A LITTLE PSYCHEDELIA INFLUENCE TO IT. OBVIOUSLY THE SPIRALS ON THE COVER, THAT'S A TRIP RIGHT THERE. A LITTLE INFLUENCE BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD, I UNDERSTAND.
YEAH, THAT'S THE FIRST SHOW I EVER SAW WITH MY DAD WAS THE GRATEFUL DEAD AT THE RICHFIELD COLISEUM, CLEVELAND, OHIO.
Stephen:  WAS IT A GOOD SHOW?
I WAS 13. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
Stephen:  HOW WAS JERRY? WAS JERRY GOOD?
I REMEMBER EVERY TIME THIS GUY WITH WHITE HAIR AND A BIG WHITE BEARD GOT ON STAGE, EVERYONE SCREAMED. NOT EVEN WHEN HE WAS PLAYING. IF YOU SAW HIM POP AROUND THE BACKSTAGE AREA, EVERYBODY STARTED SCREAMING.
HE THOUGHT HE WAS SANTA CLAUS.
Stephen:  HE THOUGHT JERRY WAS SANTA CLAUS?
I THINK SO.
NO, I DIDN'T. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  LET'S JUST BE SILENT WITH EACH OTHER FOR A SECOND. DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT? LET'S JUST WAIT FOR SOMETHING TO ARISE THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT, ALL RIGHT? LET'S LET IT HAPPEN, OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  PATRICK, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD. HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING OUT?
NOPE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  CAN YOU GUYS DO A SONG FOR US.
UM, MAYBE.
