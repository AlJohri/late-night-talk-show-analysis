Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW I NEED TO-- FOLKS, RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF THE SHOW, LET'S GET TO THE BIG STORY TONIGHT, THE MAYORAL ELECTION RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. WITH ZERO PRECINCTS REPORTING, AS FAR AS I BOTHERED TO RESEARCH, WE'RE PREPARED TO NAME BILL DEBLASIO THE NEXT MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY BEATING NOTED KITTEN GRINDER JOE LHOTA. MAYOR DEBLASIO, I SUPPORT YOU, AND SO DOES MY 64-OUNCE MOUNTAIN DEW. SIR, YOU'VE GOT SOME VERY SMALL SHOES TO FILL. OF COURSE THE BIGGER MAYORAL NEWS COMES TO US OUT OF TORONTO, AND THE DRUG SCANDAL ENGULFING CHRIS FARLEY TRIBUTE MAYOR ROB FORD. AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF HIS DENIALS, ON THURSDAY, TORONTO POLICE CONFIRMED THAT FORD APPEARS IN A VIDEO THAT ALLEGEDLY DEPICTS THE MAYOR SMOKING CRACK COCAINE. BUT, BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE-- HE IS PERSONALLY TAKING CRACK OFF THE STREETS OF TORONTO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S ONE LESS SCORE FOR YOUR KID. YOU'RE WELCOME. WELL, FOLKS, TODAY, MAYOR FORD MASTERFULLY HANDLED THESE GROWING ALLEGATIONS BY MEETING WITH WITH REPORTERS TO PLAY 20 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ONE QUESTION HE WAS FINALLY READY TO ANSWER.
YOU GUYS HAVE ASKED ME A QUESTION.
HOW DID YOU--
YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION BACK IN MAY. AND YOU CAN REPEAT THAT QUESTION.
THE QUESTION I ASKED I BACK IN MAY?
YES. YOU ASKED ME A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SUPERPOWER AND WHAT WERE THOSE QUESTIONS?
DO YOU SMOKE CRACK COCAINE?
EXACTLY. YES, I HAVE SMOKED CRACK COCAINE.
THAT IS THE KIND OF BLUNT, STRAIGHTFORWARD HONESTY CRACK SMOKERS ARE KNOWN FOR. FOLKS, WHAT SO IMPRESSED ME IS FORD DIDN'T STOP THERE. HE IMMEDIATELY WON BACK THE PUBLIC'S TRUST WITH HIS ROCK SOLID EXPLANATION FOR HIS BEHAVIOR.
AM I AN AD?ICT NO. HAVE I TRIED IT? PROBABLY IN ONE OF MY DRUNKEN STUPOR, PROBABLY A YEAR AGO. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I'VE BEEN IN A DRUNKEN STUPOR.
Stephen:  SEE? AFTER A FEW BEERS, HE'S JUST A SOCIAL CRACK SMOKER. IT'S LIKE HOW SOME PEOPLE-- YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE HOW SOME PEOPLE ONLY SMOKE CIGARETTES WHEN THEY'RE STRUNG OUT ON HEROINE. ( LAUGHTER ) SO HE'S ADMITTED TO HAVING A PROBLEM, AND HOPE HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING RASH LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT IT AS HE EXPLAINED ON CANADA'S RADIO STATION.
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND SAY I'M NEVER GOING TO DRINK AGAIN. THAT'S NOT REALISTIC.
Stephen:  YEAH, IT'S NOT REALISTIC FOR HIM TO QUIT DRINKING RIEPT NOW. I MEAN, HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRACK SCANDAL. NEEDS SOMETHING TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ANYWAY, BOTTOM LINE, BOTTOM LINE, FOLKS, SCANDAL IS OVER, MEDIA HANDLED. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. AND THERE NEVER WAS.
SO I WASN'T LYING. YOU DIDN'T ASK THE CORRECT QUESTIONS. NO, I'M NOT AN ADDICT. AND NO, I DO NOT DO DRUGS. I-- I MADE MISTAKES IN THE PAST, AND ALL I CAN DO IS APOLOGIZE. BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS AND I CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST GLEF YES, ROB FORD CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST. HE CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER THE PAST. I MEAN, WHAT PART OF "DRUNKEN STUPOR" DOES THE MEDIA NOT UNDERSTAND? T'S NOT CALLED A "DRUNKEN SM SMART-FOR." I MUST TELL YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I AM PERSONALLY INSPIRED BY MAYOR FORD'S COURAGE TO COME CLEAN ABOUT MY OWN MISTAKES. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAVE I EVER SMOKED CRACK? YES, BUT THAT WAS IN THE PAST. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S NOCT I DO TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED. ALL I CAN DO IS APOLOGIZE AND MOVE ON. I AM SO, SO SORRY THEY SMOKED CRACK, AND I PROMISE YOU, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ).   ( CHEERS ) NOW, HAVE I LIED TO YOU ABOUT NEVER SMOKING CRACK AGAIN? YES, I HAVE. IS THAT THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD? DOES THAT MAKE ME A MURDERER? NO. HAVE I EVER MURDERED ANYONE? YES, BUT THAT WAS IN THE PAST. WHILE I WAS HIGH ON CRACK. ( LAUGHTER ) IN THE PRESENT, I AM NOT MURDERING ANYONE. STAY DOWN! STAY DOWN! DIE, YOU JUST DIE. YOU DIE! YOU STAY DOWN! STAY DOWN! ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR TRYING TO TAKE MY CRACK ( BLEEP )! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BY THE WAY, IF THERE'S ANY VIDEO ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BY THE WAY, IF THERE'S ANY VIDEO OF THIS, I'D LOVE TO SEE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, SCANDALS LIKE THIS ARE NOTHING NEW IN THE LAWLESS NARCO TUNDRA THAT IS CANADA. OR AS MANY NOW CALL IT, UPSIDE DOWN MEXICO. TONIGHT, I PROFILE THE LATEST DRUG WAR TAKING OVER THE MAIN STREET OF BRITISH COLUMBIA AND THE PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. JIMMY, GIVE ME A HIT.
THIS IS CANADA-- REMOTE, PRISTINE, RIDICULOUS. AND THIS IS A SMALL BORDER TOWN IN CANADA, AND THESE ARE TOWN COUNCILORS MEGAN AND TIM FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE TIDE OF DRUGS THE WORLD NOW ASSOCIATES WITH OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH. THEY ARE DIFFERENCE MAKERS.  ♪  ♪ WELCOME TO THE TOWN OFS-- WHAT'S THE TOWN CALLED?
I'VE ALWAYS CALLED IT ESKIMO?
NO, IT IS NOT ESKIMO.
THE TOWN OF ESKIMO, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA.
ESKIMO?
NO.
REALLY?
NO.
IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE.
IT'S S-QWI? JUST SAY SOMEWHERE IN CANADA.
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT. SOMEWHERE WAS A TYPICAL PICTURESQUE TOWN. UNTIL THIS SHADOWY FIGURE MOVED IN.
MY NAME IS RYAN. I'M THE OWNER OF THE BALM WAREHOUSE.
Stephen:  AND JUST WHAT IS THE BALM WAREHOUSE?
IT'S THE WAREHOUSE FOR BOMBS.
Stephen:  RYAN HAS A PLAN.
I WANT TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRE TOWN/NATION.
Stephen:  AND HE HAS AN EIGHT-FOOT-TALL BONG-SHAPED MASCOT, NAMED BONGY.
BONGY WANTS EVERYBODY TO GET HIGH.
OSAMA BONG-LADEN THINKS THAT'S FUNNY. ESPECIALLY FROM CANADIANS ADDICTED TO TOETING THE SMOKER WEED. DAN OWNS THE SHOP.
IT HAS DEFINITELY CAUSED SOME IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS AND TAKEN SALES AWAY FROM US.
Stephen:  AND THE THREAT TO HIS TURF MAKES DAN FURIOUS.
WE'RE A LITTLE BIT PERTURBED BY IT.
Stephen:  WHICH IS CANADIAN FOR POP A CAP IN YOUR ( BLEEP ). THE TOWN'S HELPLESS PARENTS:
AS A PARENT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING A BIG, FUZZY, DANCING MASCOT, THAT IS DRUG PARAPHERNALIA LIVING A BLOCK AWAY FROM MY HOUSE.
Stephen:  WHO WILL PREVENT THE DRUG WAR? WHO WILL PROTECT THE CHILDREN? WHO CAN STOP BONGY? ( LAUGHTER ) CITY COUNCILORS TIM MORRISON AND MEGAN BRAIN ARE TAKING A STAND.
WELL, I THINK THE BONG MASCOT --
Stephen:  TAKE YOUR TIME.
WELL, I THINK THE DANCING BONG MASCOT MAY HAVE JUST --
Stephen:  IT'S ALL RIGHT, START AGAIN.
I THINK THAT THE DANCING BONG MASCOT MAY HAVE JUST DANCED ITS LAST DANCE.
Stephen:  I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. THESE TWO ARE BRINGING THE HAMMER DOWN ON BONGY WITH SWIFT, LEGAL ACTION.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE MONTHS TO GET THIS LAW PASSED.
Stephen:  BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A HARD-HITTING LAW, RIGHT, TIM?
SO I PROPOSED SOME LEGISLATION, A MOTION TO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE MASCOTS ON OUR PUBLIC, MUNICIPAL PROPERTIES-- LIKE OUR SIDEWALKS, OUR PARKS AND OUR STREETS-- YOU BASICALLY JUST NEED TO HAVE A PERMIT.
Stephen:  A PERMIT? WHAT THE ( BLEEP )? THAT IS IT!
YOU KNOW, IN CANADA WE TRY TO BE POLITE, COURTEOUS, AND CONSIDERATE OF EVERYBODY.
Stephen:  POLITE? LOOK AT HIM. HE'S A SPOILED FLUSHY PURPLE KITE. WHAT ARE YOU HIGH?
SIR-- WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?
Stephen:  ARE YOU HIGH?
NO, I'M NOT HIGH. I DON'T-- I DON'T USE MARIJUANA, BUT I DO SUPPORT THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA.
Stephen:  OKAY, GREAT. MEGAN, YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE.
I WAS PART OF OF A COUNCIL THEY WILL VOTED TO DECRIMINALIZE POT YOU.
Stephen:  KNOW WHAT? I MADE A MISTAKE. MEGAN, TIM-- YOU ARE NO DIFFERENCE MAKERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  AND, BONGY, LOOKS LIKE I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. YOU'RE THE MASCOT THAT CANADA DESERVES. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF TORONTO?
BONGY LOVES YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
