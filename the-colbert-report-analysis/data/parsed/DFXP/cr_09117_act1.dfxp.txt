Stephen:  TONIGHT, A  PROMINENT REPUBLICAN SPEAKS OUT  ON ANIMAL RIGHTS. BOY, THEY ARE GETTING DESPERATE  FOR VOTERS. THEN A BRAND NEW KIND OF WATER. GET READY FOR H30. AND MY GUEST, JOSS WHEDON, IS  THE CREATOR OF BUFFY, FIREFLY  AND DOLLHOUSE. THE INTERVIEW WILL BE CRITICALLY  ACCLAIMED BUT IT WILL GET  CANCELED HALFWAY THROUGH. A NEW STUDY SAYS 70% OF  AMERICANS ARE ON PRESCRIPTION  DRUGS. IF YOU FIND THAT NUMBER  DEPRESSING, TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR  ABOUT CYMBALTA. THIS IS THE THE "COLBERT  REPORT."
Stephen:  HEY, LOOK AT  THAT. WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT IN HERE,  OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA AND ALL  THE SHIPS AT SEA. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE REGULAR  VIEWERS OF THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I  DON'T COVER A LOT OF  INTERNATIONAL EVENTS. I SAY IF NEWS WANTS ME TO CARE  ABOUT IT, IT SHOULD HAVE PLANNED  AHEAD AND HAPPENED IN AMERICA. THINK, THINK, OKAY? BUT, FOLKS, LAST WEEK A MAJOR  STORY BROKE THAT AFFECTS ME  PERSONALLY. THEY HELD ELECTIONS IN IRAN, AND  THEN THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED,  THEY COUNTED THE VOTES.
A CLERIC HAS BEEN ELECTED TO  REPLACE THE CONTROVERSIAL  MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD.
THE NEW PRESIDENT OF IRAN  WILL BE HASSAN ROUHANI.
THIS IS A CANDIDATE WHO HAS  COME IN AND INJECTED SOME  OPTIMISM AND HOPE.
HE SPOKE OF REFORM.
AND HE PROMISED GREATER  PERSONAL FREEDOMS.
Stephen:  YES, IRAN HAS  ELECTED A MODERATE, WHICH MEANS  INSTEAD OF CALLING FOR ISRAELIS TO BE DRIVEN INTO THE SEA,  THEY'LL BE NUDGED INTO A LAKE. SOUNDS REFRESHING. HOW U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE NEW  IRANIAN LEADERS WILL PLAY OUT  ONLY TIME WILL TELL, FOLKS, BUT THE BIGGER STORY IS THAT AFTER  EIGHT YEARS, WE'RE FINALLY  SAYING GOOD-BYE TO PRESIDENT MAHMOUD  AHMA-NA-NAAA-NA-NA-NA-NAAA-HEY-E  YYY-NEJAAD. MAHMOUD, OF COURSE, IS KNOWN FOR  A NUMBER OF QUESTIONABLE  CHOICES, THREATENING TO WIPE ISRAEL OFF THE MAP, DENYING THE  HOLOCAUST HAPPENED, AND MOST  OFFENSIVELY, NEVER WEARING A TIE WITH A SUIT. EVIDENTLY, THEY DON'T HAVE  FATHER'S DAY OVER THERE. OF COURSE, MY RIVALRY WITH  MAHMOUD GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO  2006 WHEN I WAS PROMISED THE COVER OF "NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE AND  THE AXIS OF STUBBLE OVER HERE  GOT WIND OF THAT SO HE STARTS DEVELOPING NUKES JUST TO GET  HIMSELF ON THE COVER AND PUSH ME  UP TO THE GOLDEN CORNER. POINT-- MAHMOUD. BUT SEVEN YEARS LATER, MAHMOUD'S  GONE, "NEWSWEEK'S" GONE, AND  LOOK WHO'S STILL HERE. FOLKS, I'D SAY I WON HISTORY. OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE THING I  WILL MISS, NEVER KNOWING HOW TO  PRONOUNCE HIS LAST NAME. AHMA...MAH...-- JIMMY, JUST ROLE  THE TAPE-EJAD. PRESIDENT-- OH, BOY, LET'S SEE  IF I CAN GET THIS RIGHT. AH-MA-NINININI-JIHAD. HELP ME. HELP ME GET MY MOUTH AROUND THIS  CRAZY NAME. AHMA-OLLYOLLYOXENFREE-NIJAD. AH-MA-WEJUSTWONANEMMY-IJAD. AHMAD-IN-SPACE-NO-ONE-CAN-HEAR-Y  AHMAD-IN-SPACE-NO-ONE-CAN-HEAR-Y  OU-SCREAM-IJAD. AH-I-HEART-NEW-YORK-EJAD. ACH-MAAA-WE-COME-FROM-THE-LAND-O  ACH-MAAA-WE-COME-FROM-THE-LAND-O  F-THE-ICE-AND-SNOW-IJAD. I'M JUST GLAD ROUHANI IS SO MUCH  EASIER TO SAY THAN AHMADINEJAD. WAIT! I JUST DID IT! COME BACK, MAHMOUD! OH, WELL. OH, WELL. IT'S TOO LATE NOW. NOW THAT THIS ATROCITY IS  HISTORY, I WILL JUST DO WHAT HE  WILL DO, AND DENY HE EVER  HAPPENED. NATION, YOU KNOW I AM A LONGTIME  FAN OF IOWA CONGRESSMAN AND MAN  TRYING TO FORGET WHAT HE BURIED IN THAT CORNFIELD, STEVE KING,  BECAUSE TIME AND AGAIN,  REPRESENTATIVE KING HAS STOOD UP TO THE "LET'S NOT ABUSE ANIMALS"  LOBBY. OVER THE YEARS HES COME OUT IN  FAVOR OF DOG FIGHTING, SPONSORED  A FARM BILL AMENDMENT TO LEGALIZE ARSENIC IN CHICKEN FEED  AND VOTE AGAINST EVACUATING PETS  FROM DISASTER AREAS. HEY, DOGS ARE SAFE IN A TORNADO  AS SLONG AS THEY CHASE THEIR  TAILS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE WIND TUNNEL. IT CAN'T SUCK THEM UP. THAT'S SCIENCE. WELL, NOW, REPRESENTATIVE KING  IS FIGHTING BACK AGAINST A  CALIFORNIA LAW THAT PAMPERS OUR POLL TREE WITH SPACIOUS NEW  DIGS.
WHEN IOWA LAWMAKERS WANTS TO  FEDERALIZE AN OVERRIDE OF  CALIFORNIA LAW WRITTEN BY THE ANIMAL RIGHTS LOBBY THAT  DICTATES HOW AMERICA RAISES  LIVESTOCK.
THE HUMANE SOCIETY HELPED  PASS A LAW TRIPLING THE SIZE OF  CAGES FOR EGG-LAYING HENS, NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT ANY  PRODUCER THAT SOLD EGGS IN THE  GOLDEN STATE.
IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR  CALIFORNIA TO DO WHAT IT DID. WE CAN'T IMPOSE THAT MISTAKE ON  THE REST OF AMERICA.
Stephen:  DAMN STRAIGHT. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CASE OF THE  LEFT WING LOONS IN CALIFORNIA  IMPOSING THEIR DEVIANT VALUES ON THE HEARTLAND. I BET THOSE CALIFORNIA CHICKENS  DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE MARRIED  BEFORE THEY HAVE AN EGG. AND WHERE, WHERE ON EARTH ARE  FARMERS IN STEVE KING'S HOME  STATE OF IOWA SUPPOSED TO PUT THESE LARGER CAGES. I'M SORRY, BUT IOWA IS ALREADY  FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH EMPTY. ( LAUGHTER )  WELL, FOLKS, JUST-- AND I WANT  YOU TO LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO  LISTEN TO THE DETAILS OF THIS INSANE LAW. IT MANDATES THAT CHICKEN CAGES  BE A PALEACEOUS 200 SQUARE  INCHES. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THIS EGG  McMANSION. THIS IS A CHICKEN XANADU. IT'S WAY BIGGER THAN THE CAGES  KEEP MY INTERNS IN. BY THE WAY, BY THE THE WAY, THEY  HAVE YET TO PRODUCE A SINGLE  EGG. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM  IS. MAYBE I'M NOT FEEDING THEM  ENOUGH ARSENIC. AND WITH 200 PURE CHICKEN INCHES  OF LUXURY, THESE BIRDS CAN DO  THE UNTHINKABLE-- TURN AROUND. NOW, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE  SURE THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO  ME WHEN I GIVE THEM THEIR PRELAYING PEP TALK. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP, LADIES. TODAY IS THE DAY. NO ONE PHONE IT IN. I'M LOOKING FOR JUMBOS. SO GRIT YOUR BEAKS, PICK A SPOT  ON THE WALL. I WANT TO YOU BEAR DOWN. I WANT TO SQUAT OUT AN EGG SO  MASSIVE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A  GODDAMN EPIDURAL. REMEMBER, A.B.C.-- ALWAYS BE  CHICKENS. LET'S DO THIS THING. COME ON! HANDS IN FOR PRAYER. LATER, WE DO TRUST FALLS OVER A  DEEP FAT FRIAR. BUT, FOLKS, THIS CAGE LAW, THIS  CAGE LAW HERE COULD LEAD TO  SOMETHING EVEN WORSE THAN UNDISCIPLINED CHICKENS.
FARMERS NATIONWIDE FEAR  PRECEDENT.
IF ONE STATE CAN TELL THEM  HOW TO RAISE CHICKENS, WHAT'S  NEXT? FREE-RANGE COWS AND PIGS?
Stephen:  I MEAN, ANIMALS  ABLE TO MOVE THEIR LIMBS? WHERE DOES THE MADNESS END? THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, PRIGZ  REQUIRED TO GLIMPSE THE SKY  BEFORE DEATH. AND AFTER THAT, IT'S A SHORT  LEAP FOR COWS NOT BEING FED  THEIR GROUND UP PARENTS. IT'S POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE  WILD. I CAN TELL YOU'RE UPSET, TOO. STEVE KING AND I KNOW WE  SHOULDN'T BE MAKING THESE CAGES  BIGGER. IF ANYTHING, WE CAN GO SMALLER. I MEAN, JUST DO HOWEVER THEY  RAISE THOSE BONELESS CHICKENS. I MEAN, YOU CAN JUST DEFOOT THEM  AND MAKE THEM LIVE IN A PAPER  TOWEL TUBE. SEE? SEE? WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT? HE'S PERFECTLY HAPPY IN HERE,  AREN'T YOU? AREN'T YOU, BABY? ALL RIGHT, AND THEN WHEN YOU  WANT A NICE, FRESH EGG, JUST  SQUEEZE AND THERE YOU GO. NICE WORK SHIRLEY. NICE WORK. NOW IT'S FEEDING TIME. THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, VERY GOOD. SHE'S HAVING FUN, OKAY. AND IT'S TOTALLY-- IT'S TOTALLY  HUMANE. SEE, SHE'S FREE RANGE. LOOK AT HER GO. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. PUT THAT BACK UP THERE. CONGRESSMAN PASS A LAW MANDATING  MY NEW TUBE CAGES. WE CAN CALL IT "CHICKEN A LA  KING."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
