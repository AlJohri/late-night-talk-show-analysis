IS AN WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  SAN ADVOCATE FOR THE POOR. PLEASE WELCOME SISTER SIMONE  CAMPBELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HELLO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU, GOOD TO SEE  YOU.
NOW SISTER YOU WERE HERE  ONCE BEFORE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
DURING THE CAMPAIGN. YOU AND YOUR FELLOW OR  SISTRONUNS GOT ON A BUS  WATCH. DID YOU CALL THIS BUS.
NUNNS ON THE BUS.
IT WAS AN OBVIOUS COIS.
COULD HAVE BEEN NUNS ON A  HELICOPTER,.
WE COULDN'T AFFORD THAT.
OKAY.
WE ARE A LOW BUDGET  OPERATION.
THAT IS BECAUSE ARE YOU  ADVOCATING FOR THE POOR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IF YOU ADVOCATE  FOR RICH PEOPLE YOU GET A  PRIVATE JET.
BUT WE DON'T STAND WITH  JESUS IF THAT HAPPENS.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING  ABOUT, JESUS WANTS ME TO  PROSPER.
BUT JESUS INVITE YOU TO  THE MAJOR, TO THE SIDE OF  THE POOR.
Stephen: HOLD IT RIGHT  THERE, NUNSY, HOLD IT RIGHT  THERE OKAY. STOP STAMPEDING ME WITH YOUR  APPEAL TO THE JESUS IT IS  CHRISTMASTIME.
IT IS.
Stephen: WHY DO WE HAVE  TO TALK ABOUT THE POOR. KEEP IT LIGHT IT IS A HAPPY  TIME OF THE YEAR.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JESS  SUS ALL ABOUT.
Stephen: WHAT ARE  YOU-- HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A  HOME. CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT PRESENTS! AND THE WOIS MEN THEY BRING  GOLD, FRANKIN SENSE AND  MYRRH. THE GOLD IS JEWELRY AND THE  FRANKINCENSE SAY LIKE A GIFT  CERTIFICATE TO YANK YEE  CANDLE.
AND THE RICH PEOPLE CAME  TO JESUS AND LEFT THEIR  GIFTS IN THE STABLE. THAT IS THE WHOLE IDEA. IT IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO  SHARE WITH IDEA. THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY SO,  THIS IS YOUR IDEA, SHARING  WITH EACH OTHER.
WELL, IT'S NOT MINE.
Stephen: IT'S LENIN'S  IDEA, CARL MAX'S IDEA, I  DONE MEAN JOHN LENON, OKAY. NOW YOU HAVE BEEN NAMED THE  ATLANTIC, ONE OF THE BRAVE  THINKERS OF 2012.
WASN'T THAT SURPRISING. THAT WAS GREAT.
Stephen: IT WAS KIND OF  BRAVE, BECAUSE I WILL TELL  YOU WHY. BECAUSE YOU PUBLICLY  DISAGREED WITH THE POPE OVER  CONTRACEPTION AND ALL MALE  PRIESTHOOD.
I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE  IS WE TRIED TO LIFT UP IN A  PLURALLISTIC CULTURE WHAT JESUS'S STORY IS ABOUT. AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN A  PLUL ARISTIC CULTURE HOW ALL  OF US COMING TO. YOU KNOW WHERE IT ENDS UP  COMING TOGETHER. IT'S 9 CONSTITUTION. THAT'S THE PIECE THAT COMES  TOGETHER.
Stephen: BECAUSE JESUS  WROTE THE CONSTITUTION.
NO. BUT-- .
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT I  BELIEVE, THAT'S WHAT I  BELIEVE.
REALLY IN IS OH MY GOSH. BUT REALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT  THE FACT THAT WE ARE A VERY  DIVERSE SOCIETY, UNTIL  EVERYBODY'S CONSCIENCE NEEDS TO BE RESPECTED.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU  SOMETHINGMENT HOW I DO EVEN  KNOW YOU'RE A NUN? OKAY. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE  THING ON.
I KNOW, YOU ABOUT I HAVE  MY METAL ON. IT SAYS-- .
Stephen: IS THAT YOUR NUN  BADGE.
IT'S MY NUN BADGE.
Stephen: DO YOU PULL THAT  OUT AND SAY OKAY, I'M A NUN.
ON THE BUS IT, WOD REALLY  WELL.
Stephen: IS THIS A  VICTORY LAP FOR YOU BECAUSE  YOU GUYS WENT GUNNING FOR PAUL RYAN, BECAUSE HE SAID  HIS BUDGET WAS INFORMED BY  HIS FAITH. AND YOU HARASSED THAT POOR  MAN.
NO, WE STOOD WITH OUR  BURB OPS AND SAID IT FAILED  THE BASIC MORAL TEST. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT  FIGHT IS NOT OVER. HE CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN  IT'S THE WAY FORWARD. AND HE'S WRONG.
Stephen: HE ALREADY LOST. WHAT MORE, DOW WANT TO RUB  HIS NOSE IN IT? NO, NO, NO  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT HE'S STILL FIGHTING  THE BUDGET BATTLE. RIGHT NOW IN WASHINGTON THEY  ARE TRYING TO SAY THAT THE  ONLY WAY FORWARD IS TO CUT PROGRAM FORCE PEOPLE IN  POVERTY. THEY WOULD WANT TO LEAVE  JESUS EVEN OUT OF THE  MANAGER THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.
Jon: .
Stephen: JESUS CHOSE TO  POOR. HOLD ON. JESUS CHOSE TO BE POOR. HE IS THE GOD OF ALL  CREATION, TRUE.
BECAUSE-- .
Stephen: WAIT, WAIT,  ANSWER THE QUESTION, SENATOR,  ANSWER THE QUESTION. DID HE CHOOSE TO BE POOR.
YES, BECAUSE HE-- IN A  RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE.
Stephen: IS JESUS AN  EXAMPLE FOR OFF US. I BELIEVE THAT POOR PEOPLE  ARE CHOOSING TO BE POOR.
NO, IT'S ALL ABOUT  INVITING TO YOU TOUCH THE  PAIN OF THE WORLD AS REAL. AND THEN HAVE AN ACTIVE  EXPERIENCE OF HOPE. AS LONG AS WE STAY SEALED UP  IN OUR CELLS WE WILL NEVER  KNOW.
Stephen: BUT IF I'M  SEALED FUP MYSELF I CAN SEAL  ALL MY MONEY IN WITH ME.
BUT IT DOESN'T LAST,  THAT'S JESUS'S WORD. IT DOESN'T LAST. JESS SUS ALL ABOUT COME, BE  COMMUNITY, BE CONNECTED. BE CONNECTED WITH EACH  OTHER. AND THAT'S WHY THE SHEPHERDS  CAME TO THE STABLE. THE MAJI CAME, EVERYONE  COMES AND THEN WE ARE  COMMUNITY. BUT WE HAVE TO LET GO OF  HOLDING ON TO OUR STUFF TO  HOLD HANDS WITH EACH OTHER.
Stephen: WILL YOU HOLD  HANDS WITH ME? SISTER SIMONE CAMPBELL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
