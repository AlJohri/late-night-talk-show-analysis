Stephen: HEY, LOOK AT YOU. COME ON. WELCOME TO THE REPORT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! WOW. THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS, YOU SPOIL ME. YOU KNOW, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, I AM A HUGE FAN  OF REPUBLICAN VICE  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND  JERSEY BOYS UNDERSTUDY PAUL  RYAN. WHICH IS WHY I AM ENRAGED. BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND THIS  GOOD MAN WAS ATTACKED BY THE  LIBERAL HACKS OVER AT FOX  NEWS. (LAUGHTER)  JUST LISTEN TO CHRIS WALLACE  DRILLING RYAN OVER ROMNEY'S  PROPOSED 20% ACROSS ACCOUNT  BOARD TAX CUT.
THE OBAMA CAMP SAYS  INDEPENDENT GROUPS SAY IF  YOU CUT THOSE TAX RATES FOR  EVERYBODY 20%, IT COSTS $5 TRILLION OVER TEN YEARS,  TRUE?
NOT IN THE LEAST BIT  TRUE.
Stephen: TRUE, NOT TRUE,  WHO CARES? (LAUGHTER)  IT'S OVER TEN YEARS. ROMNEY AND RYAN WILL ONLY BE  IN OFFICE FOR EIGHT OF  THOSE. LET PRESIDENT BACHMANN WORRY  ABOUT IT IN 2020. THAT IS WHAT HINDSIGHT IS  FOR. BUT FOLKS, JUST LISTEN TO  THIS PIT BULL.
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST.
IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CUT,  WE'LL GET TO THE DEDUCTIONS.
THE CUT IN TAX RATES IS  LOWER ALL AMERICAN TAX RATE  BY 20%.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST.
IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
Stephen: OKAY, REVENUE  NEUTRAL, CHRIS. BUT FOR SOME REASON WALLACE  WOULDN'T TAKE NO ANSWER FOR  AN ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)  JIM?
WELL, IT'S NOT REVENUE  NEUTRAL UNLESS YOU TAKE AWAY  THE DEDUCTION.
LET ME JUST --
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME THE  MATH.
WELL, I DON'T HAVE-- IT  WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG TO GO  THROUGH ALL OF THE MATH.
Stephen: GREAT ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)  WHY--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GREAT ANSWER WHY IS IT A  GREAT ANSWER? WELL, IT WOULD TAKE ME TOO  LONG TO EXPLAIN BUT TRUST ME  T WAS A GREAT ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  DON'T WANT TO HEAR MATH. THAT'S WHY RYAN SEACREST'S  TOP 40 COUNTDOWN DIDN'T  CATCH ON UNTIL THEY ADDED  SONGS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW OBVIOUSLY THE MATH  BEHIND HOW ROMNEY CAN GIVE  EVERYONE A 20% TAX CUT  WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THE GOVERNMENT IS JUST WAY TOO  ADVANCED FOR US REGULAR  FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND. IT'S UNFATHOMMABLY COMPLEX  LIKE STRING THEORY. YOU WOULD HAVE TO GRASP THAT  THE UNIVERSE IS ACTUALLY 11  COEXISTED DIMENSIONS. EIGHT OF WHICH ARE WHERE  ROMNEY SHELTERS HIS WEALTH. (LAUGHTER)  JUST TRUST HIM, JUST TRUST  HIM. (APPLAUSE)  THE MIDDLE CLASS IS BROKEN  DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD  AND PAUL RYAN IS DRIVING UP  IN A BLACK WINDOWLESS VAN AND SAYING GET IN. (LAUGHTER)  DON'T ASK WHERE WE ARE WE  GOING. IT WOULD TAKE HIM TOO LONG  TO EXPLAIN. (LAUGHTER)  JUST GET IN. AND IT PUTS THE LOTION ON  ITS BODY. (APPLAUSE)  NOW FOLKS, EITHER WE GO WITH  THE ROMNEY-RYAN PLAN OR IT'S  FOUR MORE YEARS OF BARACK  OBAMA. SO EVEN OBAMA DID GET SOME  GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS.
THESE JOB NUMBERS SHOW  THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS  RECOVERED EVERY SINGLE JOB  LOST ON HIS WATCH AND THEN  SOME. THAT MAKES THE PRESIDENT A  NET JOB CREATOR.
Stephen: THERE IT IS. OBAMA IS A NET JOB CREATOR. SO CONGRATULATIONS TO ROBERT  BAIRD, THE GUY WHO GOT THE  JOB. (LAUGHTER)  BUT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS  ARE STILL LOOKING FOR WORK. PARTICULARLY LOW SKILLED  WORKERS WITH NO HIGH SCHOOL  DIPLOMA WHO FACE A 12%  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. NOW MY HEART GOES OUT TO  THOSE BLUE COLOR WORKERS. ALL THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IS  MAKE STUFF WHILE WE WHITE  COLLAR WORKERS HAVE THE  EDUCATION NECESSARY TO CHECK OUR E-MAIL. THE PROBLEM IS, AMERICA HAS  LOST ITS GOOD MANUFACTURING  JOBS TO PLACES OF CHEAP  UNREGULATED LABOR LIKE CHINA, VIETNAM, AND THE GULAG  BENEATH DISNEY WORLD. FASTER, CHAKOR, THEY'RE  RUNNING OUT OF MICKEY  PRETZELS. NOW HOW-- HOW IS THE  U.S.-- MICKEY. (LAUGHTER)  ALL FOR MICKEY, PLEASE DON'T  SUE. NOW HOW, HOW IS THE U.S. SUPPOSED TO COMPETE WITH  COUNTRIES WHERE WORKERS TOIL  FOR PENNIES AN HOUR? LUCKILY, ONE COMPANY THAT  HAS FOUND A WAY TO KEEP  MANUFACTURING RIGHT HERE IN  AMERICA AND THEY BRING US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SUPPLY CHAIN. FOLKS, TONIGHT I AM HAPPY TO  SHARE A SUCCESS STORY. IT'S A LITTLE COMPANY CALLED  UNICOR THAT DOES 900 MILLION  IN BUSINESS ANNUALLY MAKING  BEDDING, BLANKETS, TABLE LINENS, CIRCUIT BOARDS,  PRESCRIPTION EYEWEAR, AND  SOLAR PANELS. AND ALL AT LOW COST FOR  SIZABLE PROFIT. HOW DO THEY DO IT? VOLUME. ALSO, PRISON LABOR. AFTER ALL, PRISONERS ARE  SOME OF THE MOST SKILLED  MANUFACTURERS. I MEAN WHO ELSE CAN MAKE A  TOOTHBRUSH AND A LUNCH TRAY  INTO A CROSS BOW. NOW FOLKS,ED FEDERAL BUREAU  OF PRISONS FOUNDED UNI CORE  TO REHABILITATE INMATE ITS  WHILE PROVIDING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH LOW-COST  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LIKE  HELP DESK CALL CENTERS. NOW WHEN YOU CALL TECH  SUPPORT YOU WON'T GET SOME  FOREIGNER WITH A CRAZY NAME. YOU'LL GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD  INFORMATION TO A REAL  AMERICAN NAMED SPIDER. NOW IF--   (APPLAUSE)  AND IF YOUR COMPUTER WON'T  BOOT UP, HE MIGHT SAY HAVE  YOU TRIED JIMMYING OPEN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S WINDOW AND  STEALING HIS COMPUTER. AND FOLKS, THESE GENUINE  AMERICAN WORKERS DO IT ALL  FOR AS LITTLE AS 23 CENTS AN  HOUR. WHICH IS 23 CENTS MORE THAN  I PAY MY INTERNS. (LAUGHTER)  AND UNICOR'S BUSINESS MODEL  IS LEAVING THE COMPETITION  IN THE DUST.
SMALL MANUFACTURERS ARE  TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT IN A  TOUGH ECONOMY AND NOW THEY  HAVE TO COMPETE WITH CHEAP PRISON NEIGHBORS. TWO COMPANIES IN PARTICULAR,  AMERICAN APPAREL AND  AMERICAN POWER SOURCE BOTH  MANUFACTURE ARMY UNIFORMS. UNIFORMS ARE NOW BEING MADE  BY FEDERAL INMATES.
YES. PRISON LABOR IS REPLACING  COMPANIES LIKE ALABAMA BASE  UNIFORM MAKER AMERICAN  APPAREL. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE  MORE FAMOUS AMERICAN APPAREL  WHOSE PHOTOGRAPHERS WILL  EVENTUALLY END UP IN PRISON. BEST OF ALL, EVEN KNOW  UNICOR PAYS ITS WORKERS NEXT  TO NOTHING DOESN'T MEAN IT  CAN'T CHARGE TOP DOLLAR BECAUSE THE LAW REQUIRES  FEDERAL AGENCIES TO BUY  UNICOR'S PRODUCTS. SO THEY CAN CHARGE NEARLY  FIVE DOLLARS MORE PER  UNIFORM. NOW FOLKS-- UNTIL RECENTLY,  UNICOR HAS BEEN LEGALLY  ALLOWED TO FLY ONLY OTHER  GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUT THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE NOW  LIFTING. SO UNICOR IS NOW OFFERING  ITS PRISON LABOR TO THE  PRIVATE SECTOR.
YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF  UNICOR'S UNIQUE CAPABILITIES. SKILLED WORKFORCE,  NATIONWIDE LOCATIONS, 24/7  OPERATIONS, HIGHLY  COMPETITIVE PRICING. THE BEST KEPT SECRET IN  OUTSOURCING. OUTSOURCING WITH UNICOR CAN  PROVIDE YOU WITH ALL THE  ADVANTAGES OF DOMESTIC  CONTACT CENTERS AT OFFSHORE  PRICES. UNICOR, THE SECRET IS OUT.
Stephen: YES, THE SECRET  IS OUT. AND FOR ALL THOSE WHO ARE  WORRIED ABOUT UNEMPLOYED  AMERICANS WHO WILL NOW HAVE  TO COMPETE AGAINST CHEAP PRISON LABOR, DON'T WORRY. YOU CAN APPLY FOR ONE OF  THESE GREAT NEW UNICOR JOBS  BY GOING TO YOUR LOCAL  LIQUOR STORE AND SUBMITTING YOUR APPLICATION VIA SHOTGUN. REMEMBER--   (APPLAUSE)  REMEMBER, FOLKS, REMEMBER,  FOLKS, FIRST IMPRESSIONS  COUNT, SO WEAR A FRESH SKI MASK AND LOOK THE MANAGER  RIGHT IN THE EYE WHEN YOU  SAY EVERYONE HIT THE MOTHER [BLEEP] GROUND. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOLK ITS, BEFORE YOU  KNOW IT, YOU'LL HAVE THE  RIGHT TO REMAIN EMPLOYED. FOR THE NEXT 10 TO 20 YEARS. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
