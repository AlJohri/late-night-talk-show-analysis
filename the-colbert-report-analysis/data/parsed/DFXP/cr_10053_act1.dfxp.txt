Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, OH, YOU CAN TELL THESE PEOPLE ARE ON FIRE. LET ME-- FOLKS, I GOT A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN HERE AND WATCHING OUT THERE IN AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOT AND BALL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I DON'T BLAME YOU FOLKS, BECAUSE THIS YEAR THEY ARE PLAYING THE GAME RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART OF NEW YORK CITY, EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY. THAT'S RIGHT. THE EXCELLENT CONTEST OF TOP YARDAGE IS COMING TO MY HOME TURF AND I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE BEST TEAM FROM ONE SIDE MEETS THE BEST TEAM FROM ANOTHER SIDE. AND RUNS TO THE MOST POINTS OF VICTORY. (APPLAUSE) I CAN HEAR YOU. FOLKS, I CAN HEAR YOU OUT THERE. I'M SURE SOME OF YOU MAY BE ASKING, YOU MAY BE ASKING, STEPHEN, WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO VAGUELY ABOUT THIS SUNDAY'S TIGHT PANTS MAN CLASH. LAUGHTER) WELL, GREG, IT'S BECAUSE DESPITE MY LOVE OF AMERICA'S PASTIME, THE NFL IS NOTORIOUSLY LITIGIOUS TO UNLICENSED BROADCASTERS. IN FACT I WAS ALL SET TO BRAND THIS WEEK'S SHOW THE STEPHEN COLBERT SUPER BOWL NFL COVERAGE STARRING STEPHEN COLBERT AS TERRY BRADSHAW SPONSORED BY UNDERARMOUR EAT FRESH BUT THEN I GOT THIS ACTUAL LETTER FROM THE NETWORK. IT READS IN PART NFL IS VERY AGGRESSIVE IN PROTECTING THEIR TRADEMARK. THEY HAVE SO INTIMIDATED THE WORLD THAT PEOPLE ARE SHY ABOUT USING THE LOGO WITHOUT PERMISSION. AND IT'S TRUE. I MEAN JUST LOOK HOW COMMERCIALS AVOID NAMING THIS CHAMPIONSHIP. GET READY FOR THE BIG GAME SALE.
IT'S THE BIG GAME SALE EVENT.
BIG GAME.
BIG GAME SALE.
THE BIG GAME, MATTRESS SUPERSALE.
ARE YOU READY FOR THE BIG GAME! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YEAH, THE BIG GAME. AND OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE ALL KNOW THE WINNER OF THE BIG GAME GOES TO ANIMATED MOUSE THEME PARK. BUT--  (LAUGHTER) SPORTS NATION, I'M GOING TO-- NOT GOING TO JUST GIVE UP JUST BECAUSE THE NETWORK WON'T LET ME PLAY FOOTAGE OR SHOW OFFICIAL LOGOS OR MENTION THE NAME OF THE GAME.
I BELIEVE WE CAN COVER THE STORY LIKE NOBODY ELSE SIMPLY BY MOVING ONE CONSONANT IN THE TITLE. SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS TIME FOR MY WEEK LONG COVERAGE OF SUPERB OWL 48. JIM? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOOO!
Stephen: NATION, THIS WEEK SUPERB OWL COVERAGE--  (LAUGHTER) WILL BE AS MAJESTIC AS THE GREAT ABYSSIAN LONG EARED OWL. NO OTHER NETWORK WILL PROMISE THAT, OKAY. NOW I'M STILL LOOKING FOR A SPONSOR FOR MY SUPERB OWL COVERAGE. MEANTIME I GUESS I WILL JUST KICKBACK AND ENJOY AN ICE COLD BUD LITE LIME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS OH, SOMEONE FORGOT TO REFRIGERATE THAT. YES, BUD LITE LIME, THE OFFICIAL BEER OF ME LOOKING FOR A SPONSOR. WITH LIME. OF COURSE THIS IS SUPERB OWL NUMBER 48 SO TO HONOR THIS GRAND TRADITION I'M COOKING UP A BATCH OF MY FAMOUS 48 MEAT CHILI. NOT EASY TO FIND THAT MANY MEATS. MY APOLOGIES TO THE CENTRAL PARK ZOO. NOW ALL WEEK, FOLKS, ALL WEEK I PROMISE YOU WILL HAVE WORLD-CLASS EXPERTS IN THE GAME THAT MUST NOT BE NAMED. SUPERSTAR NUMBER CRUNCHER NATE SILVER, PRO BOWL DEFENSIVE END, HALL OF FAME WIDE RECEIVER CRIS CARTER AND NEW ORLEANS SAINTS QUARTERBACK DREW BREES. PLUS, PLUS MANY OF MY COMMERCIAL BREAKS WILL FEATURE PEYTON MANNING EATING OR DRIVING THINGS. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS, AS MUCH AS I ENJOY ENORMOUS MEN CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER WITH SKULL SHATTERING FORCE, ONE MAN HAS TURNED THIS GAME VERY UGLY. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS CORNERBACK RICHARD SCHERRMAN. -- SCHERRMAN-- SHERMAN.
WELL DONE, OKAY. FOLKS, WE KNOW THE STORY. THIS GUY COMBINES THE TEMPER OF RUSSEL CROWE, THE HUBRIS OF KANYE WEST AND THE HAIR STYLE OF THE PREDATOR. NOW GRANTED, I WILL GRANT YOU THIS, I WILL GRANT YOU THIS. SHERMAN CLENCHED THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME BY SWATTING A PASS MEANT FOR SAN FRANCISCO 49ER MICHAEL CRABTREE INTO THE ARMS OF HIS TEAMMATE FOR A GAME-WINNING INTERCEPTION. LEGALLY, NOW, I CANNOT SHOW YOU THE ACTUAL NFL FOOTAGE, BUT TRUST ME, IT LOOKED A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
CRABTREE, LOOKING UP-- THIS GAME IS OVER.
Stephen: WHAT A GAME, WHAT A GAME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. BUT JUST LISTEN TO SHERMAN'S RANT AFTER THE GAME.
I'M THE BEST ONE IN THE GAME. WHEN YOU PAIR ME WITH A SORRY RECEIVER LIKE CRABTREE THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET! DON'T YOU EVER TALK ABOUT ME! (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IS THE SCARY BLACK MAN GONE? NOW FOLKS, I GOT TO TELL YOU, I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE FREAKED OUT BY THIS. TWITTER WAS ALL ATWITTER.
THERE WERE THE USUAL TROLLS WHO IMMEDIATELY EMERGED ON TWITTER TO DEPLOY THE "N" WORD AND ALL MANNER OF MONKEY, GORILLA AND APE ANALOGIES.
MANY ARE CALLING HIM A THUG.
ONE CALLING HIM A STRAIGHT THUG.
Stephen: AN HE IS A THUG. I MEAN JUST LOOK AT HOW SHERMAN HUNTED DOWN MICHAEL CRABTREE AFTER THE GAME TO RUDELY CONGRATULATE HIM.
HELL OF A GAME, HELL OF A GAME!
Stephen: SO FOLKS I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT IS SO REFRESHING TO SEE THAT AFTER BEING ASSAULTED WITH THE OFFER OF A HANDSHAKE CRABTREE STILL SHOWED THE CLASS TO HIGH FIVE SHERMAN'S FACE. BUT NO SURPRISE-- NO SURPRISE WHEN IT COMES TO THUGS. THIS THUG REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR US CALLING HIM A THUG.
ALL THE BACKLASH, THE WORD THUG, DOES THAT BOTHER YOU.
THE ONLY REASON IT BOTHERS ME IS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS THE ACCEPTED WAY OF CALLING SOMEBODY THE "N" WORD NOWADAYS?
Stephen: REALLY, THUG IS THE ACCEPTED WAY OF CALLING SOMEBODY THE "N" WORD? I AM SORRY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY ACCEPTED WAY OF CALLING SOMEBODY THE "N" WORD. THAT IS WHERE YOU AND I PARTWAYS, MR. SHERMAN. YOU ARE A RACIST. (APPLAUSE) BESIDES, WHEN I USE THE WORD THUG OR ANY OTHER WORD FOR THAT MATTER, IT CAN NOT BE RACIST BECAUSE I DO NOT SEE RACE. I HAVE EVOLVED BEYOND RACISM. I DON'T EVEN KNOW MY OWN RACE. PEOPLE TELL ME I'M WHITE AND I BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE I THOUGHT MACKLEMORE DESERVED THOSE GRAMMYS. WELL, FOLKS, THIS WEEKEND--  (APPLAUSE) FOLKS THIS WEEKEND THE NFL MADE SHERMAN PAY THE PRICE FOR HIS BAD BEHAVIOR.
THE NFL FINDING SEATTLE SEAHAWKS CORNERBACK RICHARD SHERMAN $7,875 FOR UNSPORTSMAN LIKE CONDUCT.
Stephen: NOW THAT FIGURE OF $7,875 SOUNDS BOTH ODDLY ARBITRARY AND STRANGELY SPECIFIC. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S ONLY ONE OF THOSE. LET ME BREAK DOWN SHERMAN'S ITEMIZED BILL WHICH I HAVE RIGHT HERE. IT IS, LET'S SEE, IT'S $300 FOR TAUNTING SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE SIGN FOR CHOKING. THEN WE HAVE $40 FOR CINEMAX. $35 TICKETMASTER CONVENIENCE CHARGE. AND OH, OKAY, THE FINAL $7500 IS FOR TAKING A TOBBLERONE FROM THE HOTEL
