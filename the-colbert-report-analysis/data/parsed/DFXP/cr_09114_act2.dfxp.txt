Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  AS WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED  THOROUGHLY TONIGHT THE BIG STORY IS OUR NEW NATIONAL  SECURITY STATE. AND I AM ON RECORD AS BEING  FINE WITH GOVERNMENT  SURVEILLANCE. IN FACT, I WANT TO GO ON  RECORD RIGHT NOW. I'M FINE WITH IT. (LAUGHTER)  NOTHING, FOLKS S OUT OF  BOUNDS WHEN IT COMES TO  KEEPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  SAFE. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO COMMEND  THE TSA FOR RECENTLY DOING  WHAT THEY HAD TO DO TO FOIL A HIGH PROFILE FUGITIVE WHO  ASSOCIATES WITH KNOWN  SMUGGLERS. I AM TALKING, OF COURSE,  ABOUT CHEWBACCA. JIM.
CHEWBACCA IN THE STAR  WARS MOVIES WAS BRIEFLY  STOPPED BY THE TSA AT THE DENVER AIRPORT BECAUSE OF  HIS CANE WHICH KIND OF LACKS  LIKE A LIGHT SABRE. THE TSA SAYS THE UNUSUAL  WEIGHT OF THE CANE GOT THE  OFFICER'S ATTENTION.
Stephen: YES, PETER  MAYHEW WAS DETAINED. NOW YOU MAY SAY THIS WAS AN  UNNECESSARY OVERREACH BUT I  FOR ONE AM RELIEVED THE TSA HAS FINALLY JOINED THE  EMPIRE IN THEIR FIGHT  AGAINST THE REBEL ALLIANCE. WHO WE ALL KNOW-- WHO WE ALL  KNOW WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO  OVERTHROW A DUALLY ELECTED EMPEROR PALPATINE. NO, JIMMY, NOT MITCH  McCONNELL. PUT UP PALPATINE, OH, MY  MISTAKE, OKAY. NOW SOME ALDERAAN HUGGERS  OUT THERE MIGHT SAY THAT  THIS GUY, PETER MAY  SHOE-- MAYHEW IS MERELY AN ACTOR WHO PLAYED CHEWBACCA  IN THE STAR WAS-- STAR WARS  MOVIE BUT THINK ABOUT, IT, WOULDN'T THAT BE THE BEST  UNDERCOVER DISDUCE FOR  CHEWBACCA. DON'T BELIEVE ME? JUST LOOK AT MAYHEW'S  LUGGAGE. AND FOLKS T SHOULDN'T BE  JUST TSA, ALL GOVERNMENT  AGENCIES SHOULD BE ON THE  LOOKOUT FOR THESE REBEL-- I SAY I SHOULD INVESTIGATE  C-3PO. THE GUY SOUNDS FOREIGN TO  ME. I MEAN SERGIO, JULIO,  THREEPIO. COULD BE A SPACE MEXICAN. AND HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES SHOULD AT LEAST BE  INVESTIGATING YODA FOR  FRAUD. I MEAN 900 YEARS OLD? MILKING SOCIAL SECURITY, HE  HE-- DRY, HE IS. (APPLAUSE)  RIGHT BACK, WE'LL BE.
