Stephen:  THANKS VERY MUCH. WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY   MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS ARMOR LIKE 10-FOLD SHIELDS, TEETH LIKE SWORDS, CLAWS LIKE SPEARS. A TAIL LIKE A THUNDER BOLT, WINGS LIKE A  HURRICANE, AND BREATH LIKE DEATH, THOUGH HE MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE THAT OFF HIS TINDER PROFILE. PLEASE WELCOME THE LAST GREAT FIRE DRAKE OF THE THIRD AGE, SMAUG! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, SMAUG, WHERE'S THE DRAGON? (ROARING, RUMBLING]
THE CHIEFEST AND GREATEST OF CALAMATIES IS IN THE HOUSE
Stephen: SMAUG, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY AM NOT INTIMIDATED BY YOU, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE A REPUTATION AS A TOUGH INTERVIEW BECAUSE YOU OFTEN EAT THE HOST.
I EAT A LOT OF THINGS, STEPHEN. BUT YOU NEEDN'T WORRY. YOU'RE MY LAST INTERVIEW OF THE DAY. I'VE ALREADY FILLED UP  ON THE LADIES OF "THE VIEW." MY, WEREN'T THEY A FEAST
Stephen:  WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. NOW, SMAUG THE IMPENETRABLE, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IT'S AN HONOR.
YES. I IMAGINE IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  NOW, I THINK YOU AND I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. WE BOTH LIVE IN GATED COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE BOTH FISCAL CONSERVATIVES WHO SLEEP ON GIANT PILES OF MONEY.
QUITE RIGHT! TIME TO RETURN TO THE GOLD STANDARD. RAND PAUL, 2016! YEAH! GET SOME, RAND!
Stephen:  NOW, I LIKE YOUR STYLE, BUT NOT EVERYBODY DOES.
REALLY?
Stephen:  NO. SO LET'S GO OVER YOUR RESUME. YOU'RE CENTURIES OLD.
CORRECT.
Stephen:  YOU DESTROYED DALE.
CORRECT.
Stephen:  YOU CAPTURED THE DWARF KINGDOM OF EREBOR  AND ALL ITS TREASURES. ALL VERY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  YET, IN THIS MOVIE YOU COME ACROSS AS THE BAD GUY. WHY IS THAT?
THAT'S JUST  TYPICAL LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD BIAS. IT'S HARD FOR CONSERVATIVES TO GET GOOD ROLES IN THIS TOWN. THAT'S WHY KELSEY GRAMMAR AND I ARE ALWAYS UP FOR THE SAME PART.
Stephen:  OKAY, BUT-- OVER HERE, BIG GUY. DON'T EAT THE AUDIENCE. COME ON, OVER HERE. LOOK, YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THE DRAGON CARD HERE, ARE YOU, SMAUG, BECAUSE NOT ALL DRAGONS GET BAD PRESS.
STEPHEN, I'M NOT ASKING FOR SYMPATHY, BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT REAL DRAGONS, NOT ONE OF THOSE KHALEESI-WHIPPED LAP LIZARDS FROM "GAME OF THRONES." GOD, IT DISGUSTS ME.
Stephen:  OKAY, WHAT ABOUT TOOTHLESS FROM "HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON." HE'S THE HERO.
NO, HE'S NOT A HERO. HE IS A CAPTIVE WHO ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE RIDDEN BY FILTHY CHILDREN. TOOTHLESS?  MORE LIKE BALL-LESS! I AM AN OLD-SCHOOL WORM,  KEEPING IT REAL, YO!  DOING WHAT DRAGONS DO. BOOM. I'M THE ORIGINAL RADAR. I INVENTED THE HOSTILE TAKEOVER. I TAKE YOUR TREASURE. I DRINK YOUR MILK SHAKE.
Stephen:  OKAY. I GET YOUR POINT. STAY WITH ME. STAY WITH ME. COME ON. NOW, LISTEN WHAT ABOUT LOOKING OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY.
Stephen: DID YOU OR DID NOT NOT TRY TO KILL BILBO BAGGINS?
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, STEPHEN. WHAT WOULD DO YOU  IF SOMEONE BROKE INTO YOUR HOUSE WEARING A HOODIE. I WAS STANDING MY GROUND. DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
Stephen:  NO, NO, NO. NO, I DON'T. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEW FILM "THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES." TELL ME, DOES IT STAY TRUE TO THE BOOK?
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK SO NO SPOILERS, PLEASE.
Stephen:  OH, REALLY? WELL, THEN, I THINK THE ENDING IS GOING TO GET YOU RIGHT HERE. AND I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP. DO WE NEED TO SET THIS UP?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NO, I DON'T LIKE THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY SENT. THIS IS ALWAYS SO EMBARRASSING. I'M BLUSHING. I CAN TURN MY HEAD AWAY WITHOUT KILLING ANYONE?
Stephen:  JIMMY? ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL
Stephen:  WOW. THAT LOOKED DANGEROUS. DO YOU DO YOUR OWN STUNTS?
YES, A LITTLE BUT MOST OF IT IS C.G.I. I THINK WE HAVE A PHOTO FROM THE SET SOMEWHERE. DO WE? TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE.
Stephen:  JIM.
MOTION CAPTURE CAN BE SO TEDIOUS. I SPENT MOST OF THE MOVIE RECITING LINES TO A TENNIS BALL ON A STICK. AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT ORLANDO BLOOM.
Stephen:  OKAY, ENOUGH. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL SMAUG?
IT'S SMOUG?
Stephen:  SMAUK.
SMOUG.
Stephen:  SMAUK.
I DON'T HEAR THE DIFFERENCE.
JUST CALL ME DUDE.
Stephen:  DUDE, YOU'VE BEEN CALLED A MOST SPECIALLY GREEDY STRONG AND WICKED WORM. HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?
PRETTY EXCITED IN A WORMY KIND OF WAY. WHO WAS IT WHO SAID THAT? WAS IT PETER JACKSON? DID HE SAY THAT?
Stephen:  NO, ACTUALLY IT WAS PROFESSOR TOLKIEN.
WHO?
Stephen:  FORGET ABOUT IT. LOOK, WE'VE GOT TO GO, BUT BEFORE WE DO, ANY UPCOMING PROJECTS?
YOU KNOW, I WAS OFFERED ON A ROLE ON "SHERLOCK." I TURNED THEM DOWN, OF COURSE. I MEAN, WHO WANTS TO PLAY SECOND FIDDLE TO THAT HACK CUMBERBATCH?
Stephen:  WELL, MARTIN FREEMAN DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND.
MARTIN'S CHEAP. HE DOESN'T NEED MUCH FEEDING, APPARENTLY. SWEET, LITTLE MARTIN. LITTLE, LITTLE, LITTLE MAN.
Stephen:  YEAH, BUT HE GOT THE BETTER OF YOU, THOUGH, DIDN'T HE? BILBO, HE TRICKED YOU.
NO.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW, THERE'S THAT MOMENT IN THE SECOND MOVIE WHEN YOU FINISH TOYING WITH HIM AND YOU REAR BACK. YOU'RE LIKE HOW DO YOU CHOOSE TO DIE?
THAT'S NOT HOW I DID IT, BUT CARRY ON.
Stephen:  YES IT WAS. AND HE POPS ON THE RING AND HE DISAPPEARS. AND YOU'RE LIKE "WHA-WHAT?"
I SEE, STEPHEN. DID MY PEOPLE NOT TELL YOU?
Stephen:  TELL ME WHAT?
NEVER LAUGH AT A LIVE DRAGON ( BLEEP ).
Stephen:  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
