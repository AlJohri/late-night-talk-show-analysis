WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER  MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO WHO  STARTED THE WAVE OF LEGALIZING GAY MARRIAGE. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A TOUGH SELL  IN SAN FRANCISCO. PLEASE WELCOME GAVIN NEWSOM. MAYOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Stephen: WE HAVE NEVER MET  BEFORE TONIGHT BUT I FEEL LIKE  WE'RE FRIENDS.
YES.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU WERE  ONE OF ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF  COLBERT SUPERPAC.
I WAS TRYING TO INFLUENCE  YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: $15.
I THINK IT WAS $50 A BIG  SPENDER.
Stephen: BEING ON MY SHOW  IS CHEAP AT TWICE THE PRICE. [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE THE 49th LIEUTENANT  GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF  CALIFORNIA.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: YOU ARE FOLLOWING  TWO TERMS AS THE MAYOR OF SAN  FRANCISCO. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED  "ZENVILLE" HOW TO TAKE THE TOWN  SQUARE DIGITAL -- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DIGITAL? DO I HAVE TO LOG ON TO THE  GOVERNMENT? I WANT TO PEOPLERRIZE A NEW  PASSWORD.
WE HAVE A BROADCAST MODEL OF  GOVERNING THAT I VOTE AND I  DECIDE. YOU UNDERSTAND THIS INTERMENTLY. YOU HAVE SEEN THE CONTOURS WITH  THE IMMEDIATE WHY AND MUSIC  INDUSTRY. BIG IS GETTING SMALL AND SMALL  IS GETTING BIG. TECHNOLOGY HAS THE ABILITY TO  LEVEL THE PLAYING FEEL.
Stephen: WHAT THE (bleep)  DOES ANY OF THAT MEAN? BIG IS GETTING BIG AND SMALL IS  GETTING BIG? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IS THERE A SIL VON -- SL A  (bleep) TRANSLATOR IN THERE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? [LAUGHTER]
IT'S ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE  WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN. HIRE ASHY IS BEING CHALLENGED.
Stephen: I DON'T LIKE I  HIERARCHY IS THERE FOR A REASON. I'M A MEMBER OF IT.
YES.
Stephen: YOU ARE LIEUTENANT  GOVERNOR ALMOST AT THE TOP OF  HEAP FOR YOUR STATE.
I WANT TO DEMOCRATIZE VOICES,  REAL CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT, TWO WAY  CONVERSATIONS. I WANT CITIZENS TO BE REDEFINED. I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO DO THINGS  TO ME, I WANT PEOPLE TO DO  THINGS WITH AMERICA IT'S ABOUT BUILDING PARTNERSHIPS AND  COMMUNITY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN  CAPACITY? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE THINGS  COULD BE CARVED ON A STONE AND  PUT IN A GUARD AS A MANTRA BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN.
I'M TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITY.
Stephen: BANDWITH SO ALL OF  US CAN HYPER LINK OUR  ENGAGEMENTS TO DEMOCRACY. I CAN MAKE THIS (bleep) UP,  TOO. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M NOT MAKING IT UP. I'M NOT MAKING IT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION OF  FOLKS GROWING UP AS DIGITAL  NATIVES. FOLKS THAT UNDERSTAND A  DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. YOU ANDRY DIGITAL IMMIGRANTS  WE'RE LEARNING THE LANGUAGE.
Stephen: DIGITAL IMMIGRANTS  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE'RE LEARNING THE LANGUAGE  OF TECHNOLOGY.
Stephen: WHEN I WAS A KID I  HAD PONG.
IT'S EVEN WORSE FOR YOU. MUCH WORSE FOR YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HE WILL GET HIS.
I GOT IT. THE WHOLE POINT IS YOU CAN'T  EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN LIKE WE  WERE EDUCATED. THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT WE CONTINUE  TO GOVERN AS WE'RE GOVERNING IS  NO LONGER RELEVANT TO THE WORLD WE'RE LIVING IN. PEOPLE ARE USING THE TOOLS OF OF  TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS  PEER TO PEER. TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY. DONORS CHOOSE.
Stephen: I LOVE  DONORSCHOOSE. I'M ON THE BOARD.
GOOD EXAMPLE. PEOPLE ARE SOLVING THE PROBLEMS  NOT FOR DEMOCRAT.
Stephen: WHY ARE YOU A  DEMOCRAT IF YOU DON'T WANT THE  GOVERNMENT TO FIX THINGS. YOU ARE THE BIG GOVERNMENT  PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I WANT GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE  THE BIG PROBLEMS BUT BE LESS  PRESCRIPTIVE ON THE HOW. IT'S ABOUT AMPLIFYING VOICES,  GETTING MORE PEOPLE TO  PARTICIPATE IN THE LIFE OF THEIR  CITY.
Stephen: IF THAT IS SO  IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE WHY ARE  YOU AT THE TOP OF GOVERNMENT WHY NOT RESIGN AND BECOME ONE OF  GROUNDLINGS YOU SAY IT'S GOING  TO CHANGE THE WORLD.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THOSE IN  OFFICE.
Stephen: RIGHT, IT'S NOT  ABOUT YOU. YOU GOT IT.
Stephen: WHY DO I HAVE YOU  ON THE SHOW THEN?
I'M A CONDUIT OPENING UP  GOVERNMENT BEING LESS  PRESCRIPTIVE.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT  CALIFORNIA. I DON'T TRUST THE STATE  COMPLETELY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A  BEAR ON YOUR FLAG. [LAUGHTER] CALIFORNIA WAS A GOLDEN LAND OF  OPPORTUNITY.
YES, IT DID.
Stephen: NOW IT'S A  DEGREING DUST BOWL OF DEBT WHERE  EDUCATION ISN'T FREE ANYMORE AND PEOPLE ARE FLEEING. IT'S GOT A SMALLER POPULATION  THAN WYOMING AT THIS POINT. WHAT HAPPENED TO CALIFORNIA.
WE JUST SUBMITTED A BALANCED  BUDGET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TEN  YEARS.
Stephen: BY JACKING THE  TAXES ON GUYS LIKE ME.
WHICH SHOW SURPLUSES OVER THE  NEXT FOUR YEARS IF WE CONTINUE  TO BE FISCALLY PRUDENT. CALIFORNIA IS FINALLY TURNING  THE CORNER. DON'T GIVE UP WITH A STATE WELL  MORE VENTURE CAPLE AND PATENTS  THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN OUR  NATION. IT'S A REMARKABLE PLACE. $1.9 TRILLION A YEAR ECONOMY. THE NATION'S LARGEST. IT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE  FUTURE AND FATE OF THIS COUNTRY. I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN  CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND THE  PEOPLE THAT MAKE UP THE GREAT STATE AND I DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO  THIS NOTION THAT THE BEST DAYS  OF CALIFORNIA ARE BEHIND US.
Stephen: CAN I SAY  SOMETHING?
YES, SIR.
Stephen: YOU ARE A VERY  HANDSOME MAN.
