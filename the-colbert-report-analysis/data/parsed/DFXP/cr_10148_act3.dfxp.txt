(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN WHOSE BOOK IS "THE BULLY PULPIT." I'LL INTRODUCE HER TO THE BULLY PUNDIT. PLEASE WELCOME DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DORIS, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ALWAYS A PLEASURE. A WORLD RENOWN HISTORIAN AND PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR. YOUR MOST RECENT BOOK IS THE BULLY PULPIT. ALSO IN KEN BURNS NEW 14-HOUR DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE ROOSEVELTS, OKAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY.
YOU'RE GOING TO TEASE ME ABOUT SOMETHING, I HAVE A FEELING.
STEPHEN: I'M GOING TO INTERVIEW YOU, ALL RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) YOU GET TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE, NOW THE TABLES HAVE TURNED. YOU CAN'T TELL BECAUSE IT'S A ROUND TABLE. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. WHY, TODAY, SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT? WHAT DOES THEIR STORY HAVE TO DO WITH US TODAY? THEY'RE COMING FROM A TIME WHERE THERE WERE VERY, VERY RICH PEOPLE WHO CONTROLLED POLITICS, AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF POWER AND WHOSE WORKER RIGHTS WERE BEING TAKEN AWAY. WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO US?
NOTHING (LAUGHTER) NO, THINK ABOUT IT. THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR, PEOPLE WORKING 12 HOURS A DAY, UNSANITARY MEAT-PACKING PLANTS AND MY GUY TEDDY TAKES IT ON. HE REALIZES THE RICH WON'T STAY RICH. THERE WILL BE SOCIALISTS AND ANARCHISTS.
STEPHEN: BUT HE WAS  A RICH GUY HE WAS A RICH GUY.
STEPHEN: WHY WOULD HE TURN ON HIS OWN CLASS LIKE THAT?
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD IF HE DIDN'T DO SOMETHING TO SOFTEN THE IMPACT OF THE INDUSTRIAL ORDER, THE WHOLE THING WOULD FALL APART.
STEPHEN: HE WAS FRIGHTENED OF THE POOR PEOPLE WITH PITCH FORKS.
HE WAS FRIGHTENED OF THE RICH PEOPLE THAT THEY WOULD BE SO BLOATED THAT MONOPOLIES WERE GOING TO SWALLOW EVERYTHING AND THERE WOULD BE NO SMALL BUSINESSES, PEOPLE ARE IN SLUMS, HE KNEW FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY THE ROCK OF CLASS HATRED WOULD BE THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE COUNTRY. SO HE WANTED A SQUARE DEAL, NOT A ROUND TABLE, A SQUARE DEAL, AND IT WAS GREAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: OKAY. SPEAKING OF BLOATED RICH PEOPLE, WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT. ALL RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) TEDDY ROOSEVELT DID A FEW THINGS -- GAVE US NATIONAL PARKS, RIGHT, LIKE YELLOW STONE, YOSEMITE, THAT KIND OF STUFF. WHAT DID TAFT DO I SHOULD EVER CARE ABOUT. WAS HE ALL FOR THAT CLASS WARFARE STUFF?
YES AT THE BEGINNING HE WAS FOR MAKING THE RICH PAY, IF THEY DID SOMETHING UNETHICAL, THEY SHOULD HAVE A FINE, BE PUT  IN JAIL. POOR PEOPLE, IF THEY DIDN'T WORK, THAT'S A PROBLEM,  BUT GIVE THEM A CHANCE, GIVE THEM AN EDUCATION. HE AND HE WERE BEST FRIENDS
STEPHEN: THEY WERE REPUBLICANS, RIGHT?
THEY WERE. TODAY, CONSERVATIVES WOULD SAY THEY'RE REPUBLICANS IN NAME ONLY. RINOS, RIGHT?
STEPHEN:  RINOS? WHY, BECAUSE TAFT WAS FAT?  THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: YOU ALSO CALL THIS THE GOLDEN AGE OF JOURNALISM. YOU MEAN LIKE HEARST WHO SINGLE-HANDEDLY STARTED THE SPANISH WAR AND ALLOWED SOMEONE LIKE T.R. TO BE WITH HIS   ROUGH RIDERS GOING UP SAN JUAN HILL TO BECOME A HERO
HE WAS, BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE.  IDA TARBELL, RAY BAKER, LINCOLN STEPHENS WHAT THEY DO IS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT REALLY EXPOSES WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY. THE COUNTRY GETS EXCITED, PUSH THE OLD GUARD IN CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING, THEY MOBILIZE ACTION.
STEPHEN: CONGRESS DOES SOMETHING?
CONGRESS FINALLY DOES SOMETHING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE 50,000 WORD ARTICLES.
AND PEOPLE READ THEM AND TALK ABOUT THEM AND PUSH CONGRESS AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO ACT.
STEPHEN: WHY WOULD THEY READ A 50,000 WORD ARTICLE? COULDN'T THEY JUST CLICK ON THE 13 POTATOES THAT LOOK LIKE CHANNING TATUM? (LAUGHTER) DORIS, YOU KNOW I SPENT THE PAST NINE YEARS TRYING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
I DO, I DO.
STEPHEN: AND I REALIZE THIS IS PROBABLY THE LAST TIME YOU'RE ON THE SHOW AND I I'VE APOLOGIZED TO YOU BEFORE.
I KNOW. MY PICTURE IS UP THERE AND YOU SAY SOMETHING SEXUAL -- (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: I DON'T REMEMBER THAT!
YOU DO SAY, MY APOLOGIZE TO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN.
STEPHEN: APOLOGY ACCEPTED? ABSOLUTELY, I'LL MISS IT IF YOU DON'T KEEP DOING IT.
STEPHEN: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL CALL YOU UP  AND APOLOGIZE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SINCE YOU ARE THE PREEMINENT PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN OF OUR TIME, I'LL ASK YOU THE QUESTION I'VE WANTED TO ASK YOU FROM THE BEGINNING --
UH-OH.
STEPHEN: -- GEORGE W. BUSH, GREAT PRESIDENT... OR THE GREATEST PRESIDENT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I REMEMBER ONE OTHER TIME I WAS ON AND YOU SAID, WHY COULDN'T ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNIFY THE COUNTRY THE WAY GEORGE W. BUSH HAS DONE? AND I SAID, HE DID UNIFY THE COUNTRY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? AND YOU SAID, MA'AM, I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, HE DIDN'T UNIFY ME. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: GREAT OR GREATEST? I ONLY HAVE THOSE TWO OVALS THIS GETS GRADED BY A COMPUTER, I HAVE TO PUT ONE OF THOSE.
I TAKE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.
STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU IN GUANTANAMO. (LAUGHTER) DORIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH! DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN! THE BULLY PULPIT, PBS,  THE ROOSEVELTS, KEN BURNS, I APOLOGIZE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
