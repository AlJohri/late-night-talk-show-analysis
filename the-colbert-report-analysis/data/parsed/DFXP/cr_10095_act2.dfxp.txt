Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH NATION, IT'S NO SURPRISE BUT I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH BARACK OBAMA CONSTANTLY EMBARRASSING OUR COUNTRY. (LAUGHTER) HE'S LIKE AMERICA'S DORKY DAD. WEARING HIGH WASTED JEANS, ALWAYS MONITORING WHAT WE DO ON THE INTERNET. (LAUGHTER) THANK GOD IT'S ONLY A COUPLE MORE YEARS UNTIL WE GET TO GO TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE. BUT THE MOST EMBARRASSING THING ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT IS THAT HE KEEPS DESTROYING 250 YEARS OF AMERICAN GREATNESS.
WE GOT THIS VIDEO OF BARACK OBAMA BOWING TO THE SAUDI KING ABDULLAH. AND NOW LOOK, WATCH HOW LOW-- HE'S WAY BELOW THE SHOULDER.
TAKE A LOOK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BOWING TO THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN. THAT IS A DEEP BOW TOO.
BARACK OBAMA DID A DEEP, DEEP BOW.
IN JAPANESE CULTURE A DEEP BOW IS VERY OFTEN SEEN AS A SIGN OF APOLOGY OR CONTRITION. AND THE GREATER THE APOLOGY, THE GREATER THE --.
YOU KNOW, THE JAPANESE INVADED PEARL HARBOR, YOU BOW.
Stephen: OH, IT GOES BACK EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT. I MEAN OBAMA SPENT YEARS ON THE VERY SAME ISLAND AS PEARL HARBOR GROVELING TO JAPAN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES. SHAMEFUL, SHAMEFUL. (APPLAUSE)
WELL, FOLKS  I'M THRILLED TO BE SAD TO SAY OUR GENUFLECTOR IN CHIEF HAS DONE IT AGAIN AND IT WAS SPOTTED BY JOURNALIST AND MAN DEFINITELY NOT HIDING A BALD SPOT MATT DRUGDGE. U.S. PRESIDENT BOWS TO JAPANESE ROBOT. HE BOWED TO JAPANESE ROBOT. OUR NATION HASN'T BEEN THIS HUMILIATED SINCE JOHN ADAMS BOWED TO GEORGE 3rd'S BUTTER CHURN. AND NATION, THIS WAS AN HONEST TO GOD GROVELING I'M NOT WORTHY MR. ROBOTO BOW, THEN DID SOMETHING EVEN MORE INSULTING TO AMERICANS, HE PLAYED SOCCER WITH IT OR AS THEY CALL ROBOT SOCCER IN JAPAN, FOREPLAY. AND FOLKS, THE EMBARRASSMENT, THE EMBARRASSMENT TO AMERICA DID NOT END THERE THE ENTIRE TRIP WAS INTENDED TO SECURE A TRADE DEAL WHICH OBAMA DISCUSSED OVER DINNER WITH JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER AT THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD, AND OBAMA HUMILIATED US THERE BY EATING ONLY HALF OF HIS MEAL. HALF THE MEAL? I MEAN FORGET ABOUT THE UNITED NATIONS. OBAMA JUST GOT AMERICA KICKED OUT OF THE CLEAN PLATE CLUB. WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE IS THIS MAN SETTING FOR JAPANESE CHILDREN? EVERY ONE KNOWS IF YOU DON'T FINISH YOUR SEA URCHIN YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR DESSERT, SEA URCHIN PENIS. SO WITH ALL THIS BUNGLING IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE PRESIDENT LEFT JAPAN WITHOUT THE TRADE AGREEMENT. AND WITHOUT THE HELLO KITTY BACKPACK HE PROMISED JOE BIDEN. SOMEONE'S GOING TO THROW A TANTRUM. HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY. NATION, OUR JAPANESE FRIENDS HAVE BEEN INSULTED AND THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT TO SAVE FACE. BY THE WAY, FACE ALSO A JAPANESE DELICACY. SO TO MAKE UP FOR THIS MESS AND RESTORE AMERICA'S REPUTATION TO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE, MR. PRESIDENT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT A DOLPHIN. OH, IT'S A DELICACY OVER THERE BUT DON'T HALF ASS IT. YOU MUST FINISH THE ENTIRE DOLPHIN. THE BOTTLE NOSE, THE DORSAL FIN, THE GENTLE SOUL. EVERY THING AND NO HIDING THE BLOW HOLE UNDER YOUR PLATE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
