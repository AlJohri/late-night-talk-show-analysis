THEN, IT'S EARTH DAY, WHICH MEANS ONLY 29 MORE MINUTES UNTIL I CAN DUMP PAINT THINNER IN THE STORM DRAINS. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST, COLUMNIST GEORGE WILL, HAS A NEW BOOK CELEBRATING WRIGLEY FIELDS' 100TH BIRTHDAY AND THE CHICAGO CUBS' 20TH WIN. (LAUGHTER) THE VATICAN LIBRARY IS DIGITIZING ITS ARCHIVES.

Stephen: HEY! WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU FOR COMING! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN " ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN " ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! FOLKS, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I WARNED YOU ABOUT OVER THE YEARS. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO BE AFRAID OF. NATION, I'VE WARNED YOU THE GAYS ARE HELLBENT ON RUBBING OUR NOSES IN THEIR LIFESTYLE. THE NOSE-RUBBING, OF COURSE, VERY BIG IN THE GAY ESKIMO COMMUNITY. WELL, LOOK OUT, BECAUSE THE GAYS JUST INFILTRATED ANOTHER BELOVED INSTITUTION.
THE US POSTAL SERVICE UNVEILED ITS ARTWORK FOR A COMMEMORATIVE STAMP HONORING HARVEY MILK, THE FIRST OPENLY GAY ELECTED OFFICIAL FEATURED ON A STAMP.
Stephen: A GAY MAN ON A STAMP? ANGER! AND THEY USED SUCH AN UNFLATTERING PICTURE. JIMMY, CAN YOU FIX THAT? THAT'S MUCH BETTER. THAT'S A GOOD LOOKING GUY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, APPEARING ON A U.S. POSTAGE STAMP IS A PRESTIGIOUS HONOR TRADITIONALLY RESERVED FOR OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS AND REGIONAL SONGBIRDS. AND THEY DIDN'T PICK JUST ANY GAY POLITICIAN, LIKE RUTHERFORD B. HAYES. OH, METHINKS HE DOTH BEARD TOO MUCH. NO, THEY WENT WITH SAN FRANCISCO'S HARVEY MILK. SUDDENLY, IF I WANT TO MAIL SOMETHING, I HAVE TO LICK THIS GUY'S BACKSIDE? NO! NO! WORSE, IF IT'S SELF-ADHESIVE, NOW I'M LICKING HIS FRONT?! 'CUZ MAKE NO MISTAKE, IF IT'S MAIL, I'M LICKIN' SOMETHING! I'LL SAY IT AGAIN -- ANGER! OH, HI! I WAS JUST ABOUT TO MAKE MYSELF ONE OF MY WORLD FAMOUS BURRITOS. I START WITH A HAND-PRESSED FLOUR TORILLA, AND THEN I FILL IT WITH A MICROWAVE BURRITO. THIS TORTILLA WAS MADE BY MISSION FOODS WHOSE TORTILLA FACTORY IS LOCATED IN THE 76TH INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART SERIES... BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT! TONIGHT: CALIFORNIA'S 29TH, THE FIGHTIN' 29TH! THE 29TH IS NESTLED IN CALIFORNIA'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND ALSO CONTAINS PARTS OF LOS ANGELES. THE DISTRICT'S MEDIAN AGE IS 32.6, BUT IT TELLS CASTING DIRECTORS THAT IT JUST TURNED 26.3. THE REGION WAS ORIGINALLY HOME TO A NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE KNOWN AS THE TATAVIAM, OR "PEOPLE FACING THE SUN". WHICH IS WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS SO EASY TO BEAT AT TENNIS. IN THE LATE 18TH CENTURY, SPANISH EXPLORERS WERE DRAWN TO THE REGION BY THE PROMISE OF SUNSHINE, WARM WEATHER, AND EASY ACCESS TO THE 405 FREEWAY. SOME OF THEM ARE STILL STUCK IN TRAFFIC. IN THE 1840S, THE REGION EXPIERENCED A BRIEF GOLD RUSH, LEADING THE FIRST SAN FERNANDO. VALLEY PROSPECTORS TO SAY: (VALLEY GIRL ACCENT...) "UH MA GOD, LOOK AT THIS GOLD, IT'S, LIKE, TOTALLY GOLDEN." GOLD! THE 29TH IS HOME TO THE CLOTHING BRAND JUICY COUTURE, WHO ARE KNOWN BOTH FOR THEIR VELOUR TRACKSUITS AND THEIR CHARITY WORK. TEACHING TEEN-AGED BOYS TO READ. THE DISTRICT IS HOME TO 46 PORN STUDIOS, INCLUDING "PINK VISUAL," FAMOUS FOR SUCH TITLES AS "BUBBLE BUTTS GALORE" AND "ASIAN SLUT INVASION, VOLUME 3." I KNOW, ANOTHER SEQUEL. WHEN IS HOLLYWOOD GOING TO COME UP WITH AN ORIGINAL SLUT INVASION IDEA? SO WHO HAS THE TORTILLAS GRANDES TO REPRESENT THE 29TH? WHY, IT'S NONE OTHER THAN DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE TONY CARDENAS, WHOSE PORN NAME, BY THE WAY, IS LONDON RUBBINTUG. I SAT DOWN WITH MR. CARDENAS IN HIS CONGRESS. JIM? CONGRESSMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTIN' 29th.
GREAT PLACE, HARD WORKING FOLKS, BIG MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY. BEEN LIVING THERE ALL MY LIFE AND A REPRESENTATIVE FOR 18 YEARS NOW.
THERE IS A LOT OF PORN MOVIES MADE IN YOUR DISTRICT. WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFICALLY SHOULD I NOT BUY A COUCH FROM?
WOULDN'T BE A GOOD IDEA IN ANY NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU'RE MEXICAN-AMERICAN, CORRECT?
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU SPONSORED A RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH.
YES.
Stephen: WHY A WHOLE MONTH? BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.
Stephen: YOU ALREADY HAVE  CINCO DE MAYO AND TACO  TUESDAY. THAT'S EVERY TUESDAY.
THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING.
Stephen: I DON'T GET WHITE IRISH CATHOLIC MONTH? WE APPLIED FOR FEBRUARY AND THEY GAVE IT TO THE BLACK GUYS. >>YOU HAVE ST PATRICK'S DAY. ONE DAY. WE GET ONE DAY AND YOU GET A WHOLE MONTH. WHAT DOES PENDEHO MEAN? I GET THAT YELLED AT ME A LOT.
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU SAID.
Stephen: LIKE I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU?
YES.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST OF 11 CHILDREN.
I AM.
Stephen: I AM AS WELL. CAN YOU SAY YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS FAST AND SEE WHO CAN SAY THEM FASTER? READY, ONE, TWO, THREE, GO! (NAMING SIBLINGS AT THE SAME TIME) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING. YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST OF 11, I'M THE YOUNGEST OF 11. BUT THE 11 KIDS IN MY FAMILY ARE OLD TIMEY IRISH, WHEREAS THE 11 CHILDREN IN YOUR FAMILY -- AND I DO NOT MEAN THIS IN ANY WAY BUT THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE -- ARE KIND OF SCARY GOING TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRYISH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
NOT EVENNISH.
Stephen: CAN YOU MEET ME HALFWAY AND SAY YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I'M SCARED?
NO.
Stephen: MEET ME HALFWAY AND SAY IT.
NO.
Stephen: YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO USE THE WORD ILLEGALS. DO YOU WANT THEM TO BE CALLED USURPERS, NOT LEGALS, X-MEN? IF YOU SAY ILLEGALS, YOU MEAN THEY ARE ILLEGAL PEOPLE.  YOU COULD ALSO NOT HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND STILL BE "LEGAL." DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YEAH. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND YOU'RE AN ILLEGAL THEN YOU'RE STILL ILLEGAL. IT'S MORE ACCURATE THAT WAY.
BUT ILLEGAL GIVES, IN MY OPINION, THE WRONG CONNOTATION.
Stephen: WHAT CONNOTATION DO YOU THINK?
THEY THAT THEY'RE ILLEGAL.
Stephen: DOING THINGS WRONG? THEY'RE IN THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY. THAT'S ILLEGAL. ILLEGAL -- (PRONOUNCING IN ACCENT) WAS IT LEGAL FOR THEM TO COME HERE?
NO.
Stephen: SO THEY ARE ILL -- FINISH THE SENTENCE -- ILLEGAL. THEY'RE UNDOCUMENTED?
THEY LIVED IN A PLACE WHERE MAYBE THEY WERE STARVING OR COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY.
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S MOVE ON. YOU'RE GOING TO KICK CHICKEN FROM CHINA OUT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN'S LUNCHES. WE DON'T NEED YOUR KIND HERE! YOU'RE TAKING JOBS AWAY FROM AMERICAN CHICKENS! DO YOU SEE HOW HYPOCRITICAL YOU ARE?
NO, I THINK IT'S CONSISTENT.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY A CHICKEN AS BEING CHINESE? 'THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE.' YOU'RE A RACIST.
THEY LABEL THEM AND TELL US WHERE THEY GOT THEM FROM.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE FOR PUTTING LABELS ON PEOPLE BASED ON WHERE THEY'RE FROM?
ON FOOD, YES.
Stephen: FIRST WE'RE FEEDING THE POOR KIDS, NOW IT HAS TO BE UNCONTAMINATED FOOD. WHERE DOES THE ENTITLEMENT GRAB BAG END?
IT'S IMPORTANT WHATEVER FOOD PEOPLE EAT THEY KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM AND IT'S SAFE.
Stephen: WHEN DID THE SAFETY NET BECOME A HAMMOCK CONGRESSMAN? LET'S GO BACK TO SOMETHING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. WHAT DO THEY MAKE IN THE  29th OTHER THAN HIGH-QUALITY PORN? (DOORBELL) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: DELIVERY? CONGRESSMAN? DID YOU ORDER MEXICAN?
NO.
Stephen: WELL, THEN, I GUESS I'LL JUST LET HIM GIVE IT TO ME. TO ME. WOW. THAT'S A BIG BURRITO.  BURRITO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, NICE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA'S 29th UP ON THE BIG BOARD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OOH, LOOKS LIKE FILMING HAS STARTED ON ASIAN INVASION FOUR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
