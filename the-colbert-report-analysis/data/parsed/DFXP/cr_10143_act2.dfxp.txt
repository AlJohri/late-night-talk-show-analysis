Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, I WAS GRILLING OHIO CONGRESSWOMAN MARSHA FUDGE, WHICH IF YOU ADD MARSHMALLOW AND GRAHAM CRACKERS WOULD MAKE A CONGRESSIONAL  S'MORE. WOULD MAKE A CONGRESSIONAL  S'MORE.
MUSIC TRANSCENDS EVERYTHING UNTIL WE DECIDED IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE MUSICIANS COME TOGETHER.
Stephen: IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU WANT TO ROCK US OUT WITH OUR CAUCUS OUT?
YES
Stephen: WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SAY THAT?
UH, ROCK US OUT WITH OUR CAUCUS OUT
Stephen: EXCELLENT. THERE'S A LOT OF AFFECTION FOR YOU RIGHT NOW FOR REASONS I CAN'T EXPLAIN (APPLAUSE) DO YOU HAVE A PAC?
I DO. AND IS IT CALLED FUDGE PAC? IT IS NOT?
NO.
Stephen: THINK IT'D BE A GOOD NAME, THOUGH?
NO.
Stephen: EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BUMPER STICKER SAYING "I AM A FUDGE PACKER." IT WOULD BE GREAT. YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
Stephen: MOVING ON. YOU WERE AN OUTSTANDING ATHLETE.
I WAS.
Stephen: IN YOUR YOUTH. YOU WERE A FENCING CHAMPION IN HIGH SCHOOL.
YES.
Stephen: I'VE DONE A LITTLE FENCING.
HAVE YOU?
Stephen: CONGRESSWOMAN... (LAUGHTER) I CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL.
I ACCEPT! ♪♪
Stephen: MY NAME IS STEPHEN ♪♪
Stephen: MY NAME IS STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU DISSED PAUL RYAN. PREPARE TO DIE. IF I WIN, YOU MAKE ME A MEMBER OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. IF YOU WIN, I'LL MAKE YOU A MEMBER OF THE WHITE CAUCUS. I'LL TALK TO SOMEBODY.
DEAL! ♪♪
Stephen:  WHOSE IS THAT?
MINE.
Stephen: WHAT! ♪♪ THAT WAS ME, BABY! THAT WAS ALL ME! THAT WAS ALL ME! (APPLAUSE) SO, THAT'S TWO OUT OF THREE?
TWO OUT OF THREE. ♪♪ (APPLAUSE) ♪♪ (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR DEFEAT GRACIOUSLY. I AM NOW A PROUD MEMBER OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. LET'S PUT OHIO'S 11th UP ON THE BIG BOARD! OH! LOOKS LIKE THE CUYAHOGA RIVER IS HAVING ITS FOURTEENTH FIRE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
