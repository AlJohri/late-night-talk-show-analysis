TONIGHT FRONT LINE TRAVELS TO NEW YORK CITY WHILE THOUSANDS OF MANHATTAN RESIDENTS GO INNOCENTLY ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES. ON WEST 54th STREET AWARD-WINNING TALK SHOW HOST STEPHEN COLBERT FACES THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF HIS CAREER.
Stephen: MY GUEST TONIGHT PRODUCES HARD HITTING INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM FOR PBS.
AN INTERVIEW WITH FRONT-LINE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER DAVID FANNING.
Stephen: I'LL ASK WHAT IT IS LIKE TO WORK WITH FAMED PBS REPORTER KERMIT T FROG. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID FANNING.
IT'S A CONVERSATION COLBERT HAS BEEN PREPARING FOR SINCE 4:00. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HIS CAMERAS WERE THERE, TONIGHT ON FRONTLINE, COLBERT VERSUS FANNING.
Stephen: DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. I HAVE WANTED TO HAVE YOU ON FOR A LONG TIME JUST TO TEAR YOU A NEW ONE. OKAY.
YOU'RE THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF FRONTLINE. WHICH IS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE LAST NEWS OR DOCUMENTARY PROGRAM THAT DOES LONG FORM INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.
LEFT ON TELEVISION.
Stephen: LEFT ON TELEVISION.
THEY'VE GIVEN UP.
Stephen: WHY NOT THROW IN THE TOWEL, YOU'RE THE LAST OF THE MOHECANS. WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING, SISYPHUS?
IT MATTERS.
Stephen: WHY DOES IT MATTER? DOES IT MAKE MONEY? DOES IT MAKE MONEY?
IT UH--
Stephen: DOES IT MAKE MONEY?
IT DOESN'T MAKE MONEY.
Stephen: THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN. THE MARKET HAS SPOKEN. YOU'RE THE LAST DODO.
WELL, YEAH, BUT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DODOS I THINK WE NEED TO BE IN BUSINESS. I THINK WE NEED TO BE IN THE BUSINESS EXPLAINING THIS COMPLICATED WORLD AND I THINK WE DO IT BECAUSE WE CAN TAKE THE TIME TO DO IT. WE CAN DO IT IN SOME COMPLEXITY. WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT NEWS AND JOURNALISM,  BROADCAST JOURNALISM DOESN'T DO IT ANY MORE. THE NETWORKS HAVE GIVEN UP ON THIS KIND OF JOURNALISM.
Stephen: BUT THE MERE FACT THAT YOU TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO IT SHOWS THAT YOU ARE NOT DOING IT WELL. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, THE WORLD IS PRETTY COMPLICATED.  BUT THE MARK OF GOOD JOURNALISM IS TAKING A VERY COMPLICATED SUBJECT AND BEING ABLE TO BOIL IT DOWN INTO A SINGLE GESTURE AND ONE SHOUTED PHRASE.
15 SECONDS I BELIEVE, THESE DAYS.
Stephen: WELL IF YOU LET YOUR GUESTS TALK FOR MORE THAN 7 SECONDS AT A TIME YOU'VE LOST CONTROL OF YOUR SHOW. A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT?
NO.
Stephen: I DID. SO BUT OKAY WELL, WHAT IS THE LATEST THING. WHAT DO YOU HAVE COMING UP, WHAT'S THE MOST COMPLICATED THING.
NORTH KOREA.
Stephen: OKAY.
THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING.
Stephen: THANKS, OBAMACARE.
OKAY.
Stephen: RIGHT? THERE'S NOTHING SO COMPLICATED YOU CAN'T SHOUT THANKS OBAMACARE.
OKAY, THAT DOES IT.
Stephen: AND REACH AN AUDIENCE WITH THAT. LAST YEAR YOU GUYS DID A HIT JOB ON MY BUDDIES DOWN ON WALL STREET ABOUT PEOPLE NOT GOING TO JAIL.
RIGHT.
Stephen: OR BEING PROSECUTED FOR WHAT IS GOING ON ON WALL STREET. WHAT EFFECT DID THAT HAVE?
WELL, WE HAVE THE CRIMINAL DIVISION AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RESIGN A FEW DAYS LATER. AND WE HEARD THAT THERE WAS A GREAT FLURRY OF ACTIVITY IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO START TO BRING CASES AGAINST WALL STREET EXECUTIVES.
Stephen: SO IT MAY HAVE HAD AN EFFECT ON WALL STREET.
SO MAYBE WE HAD THE BEAST BLINK, MAYBE WE DID SOMETHING.
Stephen: THEN WHY ARE YOU SPONSORED BY GOLDMAN SACHS?
I AM EMBARRASSED BY THAT. I AM EMBARRASSED BY THAT. THAT IS ON THE PBS WEB SITE. THEY DECIDED TO PUT ADS ON THE VIDEOS. AND-- I HAVE TO SAY I DISAGREE WITH IT.
WHEN YOU SEE THAT GOLDMAN SACHS AD-- I CRINGE.
Stephen: WHEN YOU SEE THAT GOLDMAN SACHS AD, DOES IT EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HOLDING A GREEN SCREEN DILDO? [LAUGHTER]
IT DOESN'T, NO.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T.
IT DOESN'T.
Stephen: JUST CURIOUS. JUST CURIOUS. OKAY. DO YOU EVER LIE IN BED THOUGH SOME NIGHTS AND THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES THIS, MAYBE MY SHOW SUCKS BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO.  THIS IS TRUE.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE BEING A RUNNER AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE TO RACE.
ALL THOSE AWARDS.
Stephen: OH YOUR AWARDS. YOU'VE WON 65 EMMIES, 15 PEABODIES AND THE STANLEY CUP FOR JOURNALISM. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DOES THIS HAPPEN TO YOU, DOES THIS HAPPEN TO YOU. DO YOU TRAIN UP LIKE GREAT REPORTERS AND THEY LEAVE AND TAKE THE SKILLS THEY LEARN ON FRONT LINE SO THEY CAN MAKE CASH WITH IT.
NO, THEY COME TO US. THEY WANT TO LEAVE THE NETWORKS. THEY WANT TO COME AND WORK AT FRONTLINE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED TO 60 MINS. BECAUSE THEY USED TO BE THE OTHER ONE, FRONT LINE AND "60 MINUTES", "60 MINUTES" HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT OF INK ON THEIR FACE.  >>EGG ON THEIR FACE. YOU GOT ANY ADVICE FOR THEM?
PAY ATTENTION. MAKE IT BETTER.
Stephen: LET ME WRITE THAT DOWN. PAY ATTENTION. AND MAKE IT BETTER.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. DAVID FANNING, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DAVID FANNING, FRONTLINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
