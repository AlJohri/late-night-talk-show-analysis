[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS, FOLKS. NATION, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW,  YOU KNOW THAT I WILL DEFEND OUR  SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS FROM ALL WHO WOULD  ATTACK IT AND THAT INCLUDES  GUNS. FOR TOO LONG THEY HAVE DEMANDED  THAT IN ORDER FOR TO USE THEM,  YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO USE  THEM. GET THIS. AIM AND PULL THE TRIGGER AT THE  SAME TIME? HOW IS MY HAND SUPPOSED TO KNOW  WHAT MY EYE IS SEEING? IT'S TYRANNY. THAT'S WHY I AM AS PUMPED AS A  12 GAUGE ABOUT A BREAKTHROUGH IN  SKILL-FREE KILLING. IT'S CALLED THE TRACKING POINT  RIFLE, AND IT'S GOT ITS OWN  VIDEO.
TRACKING POINT INTRODUCES THE  WORLD'S FIRST PRECISION-GUIDED  FIREARM, THE NEW SHOOTING SYSTEM THAT PUTS JET FIGHTER LOCK AND  LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY IN ARRIVAL  ENABLING ANYONE TO HIT MOVING TARGETS AT EXTENDED RANGES.
Stephen: WOW! IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A FIGHTER PILOT  TAKING OUT OSAMA BIN ANTELOPE. HERE'S HOW TRACKING POINT'S  DIGITAL BRAIN TAKES OUT THE  TROUBLESOME HUMAN ELEMENT OF WHERE TO AIM AND WHEN TO FIRE.
THE SHOOTER PRESSES THE  ATTACK BUTTON TO PAINT THE  TARGET AND PERSISTENTLY LOCK ON REGARDLESS OF THE TARGET'S  MOVEMENT. TRACK. THE NETWORKD TRACKING SCOPE'S  PLACE TICK COMPUTER INSTANTLY  ACCOUNTS FOR ALL RANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. X-ACT: THE SHOOTER ALIGNS THE  RETICLE WITH THE TAG AND THEN  SQUEEZES AND HOLDS THE GUIDED  TRIGGER. THE SYSTEM ALLOWS THE TRIGGER TO  LAUNCH THE ROUND AT THE PERFECT  MOMENT TO ENSURE IMPACT WITH YOUR TARGET.
Stephen: FINALLY, A SOLUTION  TO THE AGE-OLD PROBLEM:  SOMETIMES THE ANIMAL STANDS A  CHANCE. BECAUSE, FOLKS, THE TRACKING  POINT WILL TAKE DOWN GAME AT  EXTREME DISTANCES BECAUSE THE SMART SCOPE TAKES EVERYTHING  INTO CONSIDERATION INCLUDING  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.
TYPICAL HOT ELEMENT INCLUDE  WIND SPEED, PRESSURE AND  TEMPERATURE.
Stephen: SO WHEN YOU SHOOT A  WILDEBEEST AND THEN HAVE TO  CROSS A TIME ZONE TO GO PICK IT UP, YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER TO PACK  AN UMBRELLA. PLUS THE TRACKING POINT SCOPE  COMES COMPLETE WITH ITS OWN  BUILT-IN WI-FI SERVER. NOW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE  TO TRACK YOUR PREY EVEN IF IT  LEAVES THE STARBUCKS. AND, FOLKS, IT'S THAT... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND THAT INTERNET CONNECTIVITY  FINALLY FULFILLS THE TRUE  PROMISE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. LETTING YOUR GUN MAKE FACEBOOK  FRIENDS.
YOUR NETWORK TRACKING SCOPE  RECORDS EACH SHOT SEQUENCE AND  TAKES PHOTOS OF EACH TAG, SHOT AND RESULT. HIT THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON AND YOUR  VIDEOS ONPHOTOS ON THE NETWORK  TRACKING SCOPE WILL TRANSFER INTO YOUR PHONE. YOU CAN THEN GO TO YOUR PHOTO  BROWSER AND EMAIL, TEXT, TWEET  OR SHARE VIA SOCIAL MEDIA.
Stephen: YOU CAN POST A  PICTURE OF YOU MAKING A DUCK  FACE WHILE YOUR GUN POSTS A PICTURE OF YOU BLOWING OFF A  DUCK'S FACE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND, OF COURSE, THE CUTTING-EDGE  TECH EXTENDS TO SAFETY FEATURES,  TOO, BECAUSE YOU CAN PASSWORD PROTECT YOUR SCOPE TOTALLY SAFE  BECAUSE WITHOUT A PASSWORD, YOUR  GUN CANNOT DO THE TAG TRACK EXACT AND WILL MERELY STILL  OPERATE AS A FIREARM. SO DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD  OR YOU'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO KILL  STUFF YOU CAN SEE. NOW, ONE DOWNSIDE TO THE  TRACKING POINT RIFLE IS THAT IT  COSTS UP TO $22,000 SO IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IF  YOU'D JUST TAKEN OUT A MAFIA  CONTRACT ON A GAZELLE. BUT... THAT'S A NERVOUS GAZELLE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT I HAVE A BIGGER ISSUE WITH  THE TRACKING POINT, FOLKS. SURE IT MAKES KILLING ANIMALS AS  EASY AS POINTING AT THEM. BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO STAND UP  AND GO OUTSIDE AND THAT'S MORE  EFFORT THAN I LIKE TO GIVE MY OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. SO I'M CALLING ON THE GOOD FOLKS  AT TRACKING POINT TO DEVELOP A  PRECISION-GUIDED FIREARM THAT CAN PRECISION GUIDE ITSELF TO  WHERE THE ANIMALS ARE. LEAVE ME OUT OF IT. I'M THINKING MAYBE ARRIVAL  HOT-GLUED TO A ROOMBA. A BOOMBA, IF YOU WILL. BUT PLEASE KEEP THE VACUUMING  FEATURE BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BE  A CLEAN KILL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
