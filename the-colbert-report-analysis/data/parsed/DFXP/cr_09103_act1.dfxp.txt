STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. I HOPE YOU CAN TELL AT HOME,  THESE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARE  TRUE BELIEVERS. MEMBERS OF THE NATION AND HEROES  ONE AND ALL. THANK YOU. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, I  DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I AM  UN-FOND OF THE U.N. THESE DAGS HAMMER SCOLDS ARE  HELL BENT ON TAKING AWAY OUR  GUNS AND THEN FORCING US TO SPEAK ESPERANTO. YOU CAN HAVE MY GUNS WHEN I PRY  THEM FROM MY MALVARMAJ MANOJ  MORTITAJ. AND I MEAN THAT. BUT NOW THE U.N. HAS DONE  SOMETHING TRULY UNFORGIVABLE.
THE U.N. HAS A NEW SOLUTION  TO FIGHT HUNGER: BUGS.
THE U.N. SAYS CREATURES LIKE  SCORPIONS, CICADAS AND LOCUSTS  ARE A HEALTHY SOURCE OF FAT, PROTEIN AND FIBER.
Stephen: THE U.N. BULLIES  WANT TO MAKE US EAT A BUG. WHAT'S NEXT? SOLVE THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS  THROUGH SUSTAINABLE SWIRLIES? AND FOLKS, I FOR ONE DO NOT BUY  THE U.N. CLAIMS THAT, QUOTE,  MINI-LIVESTOCK OFFER LIVELIHOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH URBAN AND  RURAL PEOPLE. DID YOU HEAR THAT? MINI-LIVESTOCK. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. ACCORDING TO THE U.N., ALL YOU  NEW YORKERS WITH BED BUGS ARE  TECHNICALLY RANCHERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELL, FOLKS, YOU WILL NEVER  CATCH ME EATING BUGS. I DON'T EVEN EAT GUMMY WORMS. I JUST USE THEM TO CATCH SWEDISH  FISH. AND I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY TO  THE U.N. YOU FIRST, GENTLEMEN, BECAUSE  FROM WHAT I HEAR, YOUR DELEGATES  ARE SHUTTLED BY FLEETS OF BENTLEYS AND MERCEDES BENZES TO  DINE AT UPSCALE SPOTS LIKE  HARRY'S BAR AND CIPRIANI WHERE I'M PRETTY SURE THEIR COQ AU VIN  IS NOT MADE FROM COQ-A-ROACHES  FOUND IN A VAN. VIGILANCE. OH, HI. I WAS JUST TAKING A MID-SHOW  BREAK TO ENJOY A REFRESHING CAN  OF MILWAUKEE'S BEST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WHICH GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE IT'S  THE BEST WAY TO WASH OUT THE  TASTE OF OLD MILWAUKEE. AND THESE TWO BEERS COME FROM  THE 70th INSTALLMENT OF MY  434-PART SERIES "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT."  TONIGHT WISCONSIN'S FOURTH, THE  FIGHTIN' FOURTH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE FOURTH CONTAINS MILWAUKEE  WHERE THE HARLEY DAVIDSON  COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN 1903 WITH THE MISSION OF CREATING  BEAUTIFUL, CLASSIC BIKES SO THAT  SOME A-HOLE CAN WAKE YOU UP AT 5:00 A.M. BECAUSE "YOU'VE GOT TO  WARM IT UP FOR AN HOUR, RIGHT"  THE FOURTH HAS BEEN HOME TO SUCH NOTABLE RESIDENTS AS SPENCER  TRACY, GENE WILDER AND LIBERACE  WHO SPENT YEARS CONCEALING A DARK SECRET: HE'S FROM  WISCONSIN. MILWAUKEE, OF COURSE, WAS THE  LOCALE OF THE ICONIC SITCOMS  HAPPY DAYS AND LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY, TWO GROWN WOMEN WHO  WORK IN A FACTORY AND LIVE  TOGETHER AS ROOMMATES. COME ON. I THINK WE KNOW WHAT THAT L  STANDS FOR. I MEAN SCHLEMIEL, SCHLIMAZEL OR  AS THEY CALL IT SCISSORING. THE FOURTH IS ALSO HOME TO MAJOR  LEAGUE BASEBALL'S MILWAUKEE  BREWERS IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY'S BEER INDUSTRY AND IF YOU  DRINK ENOUGH OF THEIR SIGNATURE  PRODUCT, EVERY NIGHT IS BOBBLEHEAD NIGHT. AND WHO HAS THE SQUIGGIES TO  REPRESENT THE FOURTH? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN FIVE-TERM  CONGRESSWOMAN GWEN MOORE. I SAT DOWN WITH CONGRESSWOMAN  MOORE IN HER WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSWOMAN MOORE THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR TALKING WITH US TODAY.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE  FIGHTIN' FOURTH.
I CAN TELL YOU IT IS ONE OF  THE MOST DIVERSE DISTRICTS IN  THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.
Stephen: YOU ARE THE FIRST  AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND THE SECOND  WOMAN IN CONGRESS FROM  WISCONSIN. IS THAT TRUE?
TRUE. Stephen: I ASSUME YOU GOT THE  JOB THROUGH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
ABSOLUTELY NOT. WISCONSIN IS LIKE 96% WHITE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I WAS  WONDERING HOW YOU GOT ELECTED. LOGICALLY...
WELL, IT HAD BEEN A WHITE  CONGRESS PERSON UNTIL I CAME  ALONG.
Stephen: DID THEY HAVE TO  HAVE ONE BLACK PERSON.
I ADMITTED TO THEM THAT I WAS  BLACK.
Stephen: YOU'RE OPENLY BLACK. I'M OPENLY BLACK. Stephen: WHEN DID YOU FIRST  REALIZE YOU WERE BLACK?
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. THE LITTLE GIRL IN MY  NEIGHBORHOOD ASKED HER MOM, YOU  KNOW, WAS I CHOCOLATE?
Stephen: CONGRESSWOMAN, ARE  YOU CHOCOLATE? DOES THAT MAKE ME VANILLA?
I DON'T KNOW. Stephen: COULD I BE  CHOCOLATE?
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT YOU  COULD HAVE SOME CHOCOLATE IN  YOU. WE'RE ALL MIXED UP WITH A LOT OF  STUFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). VANILLA, A LITTLE MINT IN THERE  SOMETIMES.
Stephen: IS THAT GAY? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW, MINTY, KIND OF  IRISH.
Stephen: OH, IRISH. IRISH PEOPLE ARE AUTOMATICALLY  GAY IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT. Stephen: YOU SAID MINTY. THAT'S KIND OF A GAY FLAVOR. OH, YEAH, THAT GUY HAS GOT MORE  THAN A HINT OF MINT.
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT AND I  LOVE MINT.
Stephen: WELL... YOU NEVER KNOW. Stephen: YOU NEVER KNOW. MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE MINTY. YOU SIT ON THE HOUSE COMMITTEE  ON FINANCIAL SERVICES WHICH  OVERSEES WALL STREET AND THE  BANKS.
THAT'S TRUE. Stephen: AS A PERSON WHO  VOTED FOR OBAMA'S STIMULUS  PACKAGE, ARE YOU READY TO ACCEPT BLAME FOR THE CURRENT STATE OF  THE ECONOMY?
NO. Stephen: PLAY THE BLAME GAME. (SINGING) OUR GUEST TODAY IS  GWEN MOORE. SHE'S GOING TO BLAME PEOPLE  OTHER THAN HERSELF FOR THE STATE  OF THE ECONOMY. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US HERE,  GWEN. WHO DO YOU BLAME FOR THE  ECONOMY?
WELL, I THINK THAT WALL  STREET, WE HAVE SOME BRILLIANT  PEOPLE ON THE PLANET THAT WERE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR DUE. WE'VE HAD TWO WARS THAT WE  DIDN'T PAY FOR.
Stephen: WE SHOULDN'T HAVE  GONE TO WAR.
THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION. Stephen: WE'RE IN THAT. THAT'S THIS CONVERSATION. YOU BROUGHT UP THE WAR.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  ECONOMY.
Stephen: YOU BROUGHT UP THE  WAR.
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. Stephen: WHO DO YOU BLAME? NOW YOU'RE BLAMING THE WARS FOR  THE ECONOMY. YOU DON'T SUPPORT OUR TROOPS. YOU DON'T SUPPORT OUR TROOPS. YOU'RE BLAMING OUR TROOPS FOR  THIS DEMOCRATIC FAILURE OF THE  ECONOMY.
WE HAVE TO FEED THE TROOPS IN  THE MORNING.
Stephen: I'M TALKING ABOUT  THE ECONOMY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LUCKY  CHARMS.
LUCKY CHARMS. YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT IS NEVER  IMPORTANT EXCEPT WHEN WE WANT  FEMA TO GET US UP OUR ROOF. WE WANT THE A.F.T. TO BE THERE  TO CATCH A TERRORIST. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, GOVERNMENT  IS TOO BIG.
Stephen: I AGREE. O WE AGREE. tephen: WE AGREE THAT  GOVERNMENT IS TOO BIG.
WE AGREE THAT GOVERNMENT IS  TOO BIG UNTIL YOU WANT IT.
Stephen: RIGHT. I AGREE THAT THE THINGS I NEED  SHOULD BE PAID FOR AND THE  THINGS I DON'T NEED SHOULD NOT BE PAID FOR.
EXACTLY. Stephen: THAT MAKES SENSE. THAT MAKES SENSE TO PEOPLE,  BUT IT'S COMPLETELY ABSURD.
Stephen: I ACCEPT YOUR  APOLOGY. LET'S TALK ABOUT PAUL RYAN FOR A  SECOND. YOU SAID THAT PAUL RYAN'S BUDGET  WAS CLASS WARFARE AGAINST THE  POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS MEANT TO LINE THE POCKETS OF THE RICH.
THE IMPACT OF HIS BUDGET  WHICH PREVAILS UPON THE POOR,  THE MIDDLE CLASS AS OPPOSEDDED TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE GREATEST  ABILITY AND MEANS.
Stephen: LIKE ME. GUYS LIKE ME. I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY.
WHAT IS YOUR INCOME. Stephen: A LOT. PEOPLE LIKE YOU. Stephen: ALL THE MONEY OR NOT  ALL OF IT. MY FRIENDS HAVE SOME TOO. THEN IT TRICKLES DOWN ON TO  POORER PEOPLE.
IT AIN'T HAPPENING. Stephen: WE HAVE TO FILL MY  BUCKET MORE SO IT STARTS. NOW IT'S 90% FULL BUT I PROMISE  YOU IF YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT  MORE MONEY, IT WILL START TO  TRICKLE.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE A  ROLEX WATCH? HOW MANY CAN YOU WEAR?
Stephen: WELL, ONE, TWO,  THREE, FOUR, FIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I DO WANT TO HELP POOR  PEOPLE.
Stephen: I CAN'T. I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY YET.
WE HAVE FAMILY. IF YOU'RE MY HUSBAND AND I'M  YOUR WIFE, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T  GET TO GO TO WORK AND COME HOME AND SAY, WELL, GEE, I MADE MONEY  TODAY AND YOU WERE A STAY AT  HOME WIFE SO THEREFORE I GET STEAK AND YOU GET TO EAT THE  RAMAN NOODLES.
Stephen: I'M WORKING LATE. YOU DON'T GET TO DO THAT  BECAUSE WE'RE FAMILY.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE MY WIFE  AND I'M YOUR HUSBAND, I'D SAY WE  HAVE A RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM.
WE PROBABLY WOULD. Stephen: WE NEED COUNSELING. BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE  EQUAL IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
Stephen: ARE YOU GETTING  ANGRY RIGHT NOW?
NO. Stephen: YOU'RE NOT ANGRY. NO, I'M NOT ANGRY. I'M NOT AN ANGRY BLACK WOMAN.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT? NO. Stephen: SO THAT WOULD BE  BAD. YOU GET ANGRY SOMETIMES DON'T  YOU?
I DO GET ANGRY SOMETIMES. Stephen: AND ARE YOU A BLACK  WOMAN.
I AM A BLACK WOMAN. Stephen: SO YOU ARE  OCCASIONALLY AN ANGRY BLACK  WOMAN.
I AM OCCASIONALLY A BLACK  WOMAN. I AMIE KOITIONALLY ANGRY AND  MOST OF THE TIME A BLACK WOMAN.
Stephen: ARE YOU A BLACK  WOMAN RIGHT NOW.
YES. Stephen: YOU ARE? THIS IS MOST OF THE TIME. Stephen: MOST OF THE TIME  YOU'RE A BLACK WOMAN BUT NOT ALL  THE TIME. I DIDN'T WANT TO JUDGE. BUT AT ANY POINT DURING THE  INTERVIEW YOU STOP BEING A BLACK  WOMAN, LET ME KNOW.
YOU STOP BEING A RICH WHITE  MAN, LET ME KNOW.
Stephen: YOU LET ME KNOW TOO  BECAUSE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS  HAPPENED. FOLKS, WHEN WE RETURN, I WILL  CONTINUE TO GRILL REPRESENTATIVE  MOORE LIKE A JOHNSONVILLE BRAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
