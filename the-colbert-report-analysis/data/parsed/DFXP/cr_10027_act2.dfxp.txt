Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, NATION. THANKS SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THIS SHOW IS COMES AS NO SURPRISE TO YOU I LOVE THE OLYMPICS. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW TIMES YOU CAN THROW A SPEAR IN A STADIUM AND NOT GET ARREST FORWARD IT. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) FOLKS-- THANK YOU, THAT ONE'S FREE. THAT'S FREE. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE UPCOMING WIRPTD QAIMS IN SOCHI, RUSSIA. I EVEN LEARNED SOME RUSSIAN LIKE "DOSVEDANYA." WHICH MEANS "TWO VEDANYAS." AND "VOHTA-KA," WHICH I BELIEVE MEANS I'D LIKE TO WANG NEED IN THE NEAREST FOUNTAIN, PLEASE. BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE. AND FOR ALL THESE OLYMPICS, RUSSIA IS PROMISING UNPRECEDENTED SECURITY MEASURES. NOSSURPRISING, OF COURSE, GIVEN ALL THE THREATS THE COUNTRY FACES-- CHECHEN REBELS, KAZAKH FUNDAMENTALISTS, RIDING PUSSY. BUT THERE'S ONE GROUP THAT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN ALL OF THOSE COMBINED-- THE GAYS. YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NO, NO, WE'RE ALL SCARED. ( LAUGHTER ) RUSSIA'S OLYMPICS ARE ENDANGERED BY HOMOSEXUALS WHO INSIST ON EXISTING DURING THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHY LAST JUNE, VLADIMIR PUTIN SIGNED A LAW BANNING ALL HOMOSEXUAL PROPAGANDA, INCLUDING PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION, OR DISPLAYING SYMBOLS LIKE A RAINBOW FLACK. GOOD THINKING. BECAUSE THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM HAS ALWAYS HAD A GAY AGENDA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I MEAN, IT EXPLAINS WHY WE'RE ALWAYS HEARING ABOUT ROY G. BIV, BUT NEVER MRS.  G. BIV. WHERE IS SHE, ROY? SOME IN THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY, WHICH CONSIDER STANDS FOR SOMETHING-SOMETHING-SOMETHING- TE SOMETHING-SOMETHING-SOMETHING-TE RRORIST, ARE THREATENING TO STAGE A GAY-IN.
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF ABUTTING PROTEST MOVEMENTS AGAINST THE WINTER OLYMPICS BECAUSE OF THE HOMOPHOBIC STANCE OF PUTINS AND THE RUSSIAN LAWS.
THERE SHOULD BE WEARING OF RAINBOW COLORS. THERE SHOULD BE PROTESTS. THERE SHOULD BE MORE SPEECH.
AN OPENLY GAY SPADE SKATER WANTS TO GO THERE, WEAR A RAINBOW PIN AND SAY, "I'M HERE, I'M GAY, AND I'M OKAY."
HEY, BLAKE, DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU NEED TO WEAR A RAINBOW PIN WHEN YOU'RE WEARING THE MAN SPANX. WE GET THE MESSAGE. FORTUNATELY, RUSSIAN OLYMPIC OFFICIALS HAVE COME UP WITH A FOOL-PROOF WAY TO MAKE THE OLYMPIC TORCH A LITTLE LESS FLAMING.
PICTURES SHOWING THE OFFICIAL UNIFORM FOR VOLUNTEERS AND STAFF, BRIGHTLY COLORED SKI JABTS AND HATS FEATURING THE OLYMPIC RING. SOME PEOPLE SAY COLORS VERY SIMILAR TO THE RAINBOW FLAG THAT SYMBOLIZES THE L.G.B.T. MOVEMENT.
Stephen:  YES, BY WEARING THESE RAINBOW UNIFORMS, THE RUSSIANS ARE LEAVING THE GAYS WITH NO PROTEST SYMBOL. AS PRESIDENT OF THE OLYMPIC ORGANIZES COMMITTEE CHERNYSHENKO, TOLD "USA TODAY," I AM VERY BRAVE, I WILL PUT MY RAINBOW PIN ON AND LET ME GO TO JAIL IN RUSSIA BECAUSE I WILL BE PROMOTING GAY RIGHT IN THE OLYMPIC GAME. HAS ANYBODY NOTICED WHAT KIND OF UNIFORM GAME ORGANIZERS WILL BE WEARING? YES, WE TOOK YOUR RAINBOW. SUCK IT, GAYS. JUST-- JUST DON'T DO IT IN RUSSIA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, WHEN SOMEONE WATCHING THE OLYMPICS SEES RAINBOW CLOACTING, THEY WON'T THINK THEY'RE A GAY PROTESTER. THEY'RE JUST THINK THEY HAVE TERRIBLE TASTE. BRAVO, RUSSIA NO COUNTRY HAS NEUTRALIZED THEN HITLER ONE-UPS JESSE OWENS BY WEARING BLACK FACE. I AGREE, NOT COOL, HITLER, NOT COOL. I'M SORRY, THIS IS WHERE I GET OFF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
