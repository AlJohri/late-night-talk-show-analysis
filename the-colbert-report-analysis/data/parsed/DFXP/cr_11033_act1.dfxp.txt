Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! GREAT TO HAVE ME WITH YOU! (LAUGHTER) TONIGHT'S BROADCAST EMANATES FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. THERE'S ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR. CAN YOU FEEL IT? (CHEERS)  AT LEAST I THINK IT'S ELECTRICITY. THEY JUST LEGALIZED POT HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LAST NIGHT, I GOT A CONTACT HIGH JUST WALKING DOWN TO STREET, AND ENDED UP IN MY HOTEL ROOM BINGE-WATCHING C-SPAN. I THINK IT WAS C-SPAN. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY SHOWER CURTAIN, I DON'T KNOW WE'RE HERE AT BEAUTIFUL GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, OF COURSE, NAMED FOR OUR FIRST PRESIDENT, GEORGE UNIVERSITY. (LAUGHTER) D.C. HAS BEEN "THE REPORT"'S SECOND HOME FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS AND PART OF ME WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE CAPITOL  -- MY PORTRAIT IS IN THE SMITHSONIAN. MY WAX FIGURE IS IN MADAME TUSSAUD'S, AND MY iPhone IS IN THE PANDA PEN AT THE NATIONAL ZOO. COUGH IT UP, BAO BAO! IN 2010, JON STEWART AND I HELD THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY AND/OR FEAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THE NATION THRONGED TO THE WASHINGTON MALL TO FINALLY GET SOME ANSWERS... ABOUT WHY WE ASKED THEM TO COME TO THE WASHINGTON MALL. I CAN FINALLY REVEAL IT WAS A GROUPON THING. I NEEDED A QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE TO GET 20% OFF A MEMBERSHIP AT SOUL CYCLE. (LAUGHTER) AND BECAUSE THIS IS OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, TONIGHT, I'M PROUD TO LAUNCH PART ONE OF MY ONE-PART SERIES. BETTER KNOW "A" AMERICA. TONIGHT, AMERICA:  THE FIGHTIN' US.! AMERICA BEGAN 270 MILLION YEARS AGO AS PART OF PANGEA, UNTIL IT SPLIT OFF, THANKS TO JESUS. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS JUST A HAPPY ACCIDENT -- ALL HE WAS TRYING TO DO IS SEND AN EARTHQUAKE TO PUNISH GAY DINOSAURS. (LAUGHTER) THEN CAME THE PEOPLE WITH THE FEATHERS ON THEIR HEADS. AND THE PEOPLE WITH THE BUCKLES ON THEIR HATS. THEN, IN 1776, AMERICA HAPPENED. THE FOUNDING FATHERS GATHERED IN PHILADELPHIA AND UNANIMOUSLY DECLARED -- WE SHOULD REALLY MOVE THE CAPITAL SOMEWHERE ELSE. (LAUGHTER)    FAMOUS RESIDENTS OF AMERICA INCLUDE CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, APPLE C.E.O. TIM COOK, AND JEFFERY DONOVAN OF "BURN NOTICE." (APPLAUSE) WHEN VISITING AMERICA, DON'T MISS OUT ON ITS SIGNATURE DISH: FOOD. (APPLAUSE) LOOK FOR IT UNDER THE MELTED CHEESE. AND WHO HAS THE OVAL OFFICES TO REPRESENT THIS GREAT NATION? NONE OTHER THAN TWO-TERM PRESIDENT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I RECENTLY SAT DOWN WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA LATER ON IN TONIGHT'S SHOW. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE REPUBLICAN LANDSLIDE IN THE MIDTERMS WAS A STINGING REBUKE OF THE PRESIDENT. I CHECKED, HE DIDN'T GET ONE VOTE. (LAUGHTER) AND YET, RIGHT AFTER THE MIDTERMS, HE ISSUES AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SHIELDING UP TO 5 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH. SHIELDING THEM. HE IS SHIELDING THEM. NOW HE'S MAKING THEM S.H.I.E.L.D. AGENTS? (LAUGHTER) NICK FURY MUST BE... VERY ANGRY. ONLY WORD I COULD THINK OF. THEN THE PRESIDENT SIGNED A CLIMATE CHANGE ACCORD WITH CHINA, PUSHED THE F.C.C. TO ADOPT NET NEUTRALITY, AND WANTS TO PUT CAMERAS ON COPS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OBAMA IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. HE'S LIKE BOTH GUYS IN LETHAL WEAPON: HE'S A CRAZY RENEGADE WITH NOTHING TO LOSE AND A BLACK GUY WHO'S THIS CLOSE TO RETIREMENT! (LAUGHTER) WORST OF ALL, I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS (BLEEP)! WORST OF ALL, OBAMA IS THREATENING TO GIVE US HEALTHCARE AGAIN, BECAUSE FROM NOW UNTIL FEBRUARY 15th IS THE ObamaCare OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD, WHEN YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND SELECT WHICHEVER DEATH PANEL YOU PREFER TO SMOTHER YOU IN YOUR SLEEP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT DON'T FALL FOR IT. NO! DO NOT FALL FOR IT! OR ANYTHING THIS GUY SAYS. HE CAN'T MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. THE PEOPLE WITH REAL POWER IN THIS COUNTRY ARE PUNDITS LIKE ME AND PAPA BEAR.
I HAVE MORE POWER DOING WHAT I'M DOING, OKAY, THAN GETTING INVOLVED WITH THE POLITICAL PROCESS. PLUS, YOU HAVE TO KISS BUTT TO GET MONEY. YOU KNOW, 150 MILLION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I CAN GET THINGS DONE LIKE THAT. AND THAT KIND OF POWER I COULD NEVER HAVE IN ELECTED OFFICE EVER
Stephen: OH, YEAH. O'REILLY CLEARLY HAS MORE POWER THAN THE PRESIDENT. WHEN'S THE LAST TIME OBAMA SOLD SELF-LUBRICATING CATHETERS? (LAUGHTER) POINT IS, I COULD BE A POLITICIAN LIKE THAT -- (SNAP) -- BUT A POLITICIAN COULD NEVER DO MY JOB, WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO MY CURE FOR ObamaCare, AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. STEPHEN.
Stephen:  PRESIDENT OBAMA I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE OUT HERE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PRESIDENT OBAMA, I'M THRILLED YOU'RE HERE BUT I DID NOT EXPECT YOU FOR ANOTHER THREE MINUTES.
STEPHEN, YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF SHOTS AT MY JOB. I DECIDED I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE A SHOT AT YOURS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF THE WAY WHAT PART OF THE SEGMENT ARE WE IN NOW? WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO BE DOING?
Stephen: I WAS ABOUT TO DO "THE WORD," SIR.
"THE WORD." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW HARD CAN THIS BE? I'M JUST GOING TO SAY WHATEVER YOU WERE ABOUT TO SAY.
Stephen: OKEY-DOKE. OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION -- NATION, INSTEAD OF THE WORD, LET'S MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRESIDENTIAL, WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S "DECREE"... (PLAYING "HAIL TO THE CHIEF," THEN CLANG) ...  TO HEALTH IN A HAND BASKET. NATION, AS YOU KNOW, I, STEPHEN COLBERT, HAVE NEVER CARED FOR OUR PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) THE GUY IS SO ARROGANT, I BET HE TALKS ABOUT HIMSELF IN THE THIRD PERSON. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT EVEN I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT ObamaCare IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. AND WHILE IT'S BEEN POLITICALLY DIVISIVE, THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE FROM BOTH PARTIES LIKE ABOUT ObamaCare. (LAUGHTER) FOR INSTANCE, THAT CHILDREN CAN STAY ON THEIR PARENTS' POLICIES UNTIL AGE 26. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEARLY 7 MILLION PEOPLE SIGNED UP LAST YEAR AND ALMOST 1 MILLION MORE HAVE SIGNED UP IN JUST THE PAST FEW WEEKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, NATION THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU STOP SOMETHING THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO LIKE? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WELL, FIRST OFF, NOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THEY COULD PASS A BILL REPEALING ObamaCare. BUT THE PRESIDENT STILL HAS THE VETO. AND IF I KNOW THAT GUY, HE'S WILLING TO USE IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND LET'S FACE IT. EVEN IF REPUBLICANS SOMEHOW DID REPEAL IT, THEY'D HAVE TO REPLACE IT  WITH THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE PLAN. (LAUGHTER) AND ONCE THEY TOUCH IT, THEY OWN IT. THEN IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, SUDDENLY EVERYBODY WILL BE COMPLAINING ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL-CARE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, ANOTHER STRATEGY IS TAKING ObamaCare TO THE SUPREME COURT AND TRYING TO GET IT THROWN OUT. BUT LAST TIME WE TRIED THAT, IT DIDN'T WORK. I BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY ONE SURE FIRE WAY TO KILL THIS THING. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE HAVE TO MAKE SIGNING UP FOR ObamaCare UNAPPEALING TO YOUNG PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE CAN SCARE THEM AWAY BY REMINDING THEM THAT LAST YEAR'S WEB SITE ROLLOUT WAS A LITTLE BUMPY. (LAUGHTER) REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL HEALTHCARE.GOV WEB SITE? I THINK THAT'S WHERE DISNEY GOT THE IDEA FOR "FROZEN." (LAUGHTER) NOW, THE NEW WEB SITE WORKS, AND MOST YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GET COVERED FOR LESS THAN $100. BUT HOW'S THE PRESIDENT GOING TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT TO THE KIDS? (APPLAUSE) HE COULD TRY TO APPEAL TO THEM DIRECTLY THROUGH A SPEECH OR A PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T WATCH REAL NEWS SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY WATCH COMEDY SHOWS, AND I (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY WATCH COMEDY SHOWS, AND I JUST DON'T SEE THE PRESIDENT GOING ON ONE OF THOSE. THEY'RE BENEATH HIS DIGNITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BESIDES, EVEN IF HE DID GET HIS MESSAGE ACROSS, YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T THINK THEY NEED ANY INSURANCE. AFTER ALL, THEY'RE YOUNG! THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT EVERYONE EVENTUALLY GROWS OLDER... AT SOMETIMES A FASTER RATE THAN OTHERS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND THAT'S THE DECREE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD.
