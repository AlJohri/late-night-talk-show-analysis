Stephen: TONIGHT CHURCH ATTENDANCE HAS FALLEN, I SAY WAIT THREE DAYS AND IT WILL RISE AGAIN, AND MY GUEST NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON DIRECTS THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM AND IS HOST OF THE SCIENCE SERIES COSMOS, I'LL REMIND HIM THAT IN THIS STUDIO THE UNIVERSE REVOLVES AROUND ME. DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME STARTED THIS WEEKEND AND I FINALLY WON THE FOUR MONTH BATTLE WITH OUR OVEN CLOCK. THIS IS THE "THE COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US ON THIS LOVELY MONDAY NIGHT, IN EARLY MARCH. FOLKS, SOME OF YOU OUT THERE MAY NOT KNOW IT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS, FOLKS. I KNOW SOME YOU KNOW THIS BUT AS A PROUD CATHOLIC, I HAVE NEVER REALLY CARED MUCH FOR ATHEISTS. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU ARE TURNING YOUR BACK ON GOD'S CHRISTIAN TEACHINGS, THEN AT LEAST HAVE THE COURAGE TO CALL YOURSELF A LUTHERAN. BUT FOLKS, THE LATEST STUNT BY THESE NONBELIEVERS IS TRULY NONBELIEVABLE.
A GROUP CALLED AMERICAN ATHEISTS IS FIGHTING TO REMOVE A CROSS ON DISPLAY AT THE SOON TO OPEN 9/11 MEMORIAL MUSEUM SAYING THE SIGHT OF IT CAUSES QUOTE MENTAL ANGUISH.
Stephen: YES, THIS CROSS CAUSES MENTAL ANGUISH FOR ATHEISTS. WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE A CARE-FREE VISIT TO THE 9/11 MUSEUM. NOW FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS THIS ATHEIST LAWSUIT OFFENDS ME AND NOT JUST AS A CHRISTIAN BUT AS A LOVER OF GOOD PUBLIC RELATIONS. COME ON, ATHEISTS, YOU'RE PROTESTING A CROSS IN THE 9/11 MUSEUM? I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE GOD CAN HEAR YOU, BUT YOU REALIZE THE REST OF US CAN, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) BUT, BUT FOLKS, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN ATHEISTS DAVID SILVERMAN JUST CANNOT LET THIS ONE GO.
PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE CROSS IS CHRISTIAN, THAT IT WAS INSTALLED IN A RELIGIOUS SERVICE AND ON CONSECRATED GROUND WHICH MAKES IT A  SHRINE ON PUBLIC LAND IN A WORLD TRADE CENTER. IT'S A  CHRISTIAN CROSS.
Stephen: YES, THOSE I BEAMS FOUND IN THE WRECKAGE CAN ONLY BE A CHRISTIAN CROSS, WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE EXPLANATION COULD THERE BE FROM A BUILDING MADE OF RIGHT ANGLES TO LEAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEHIND? APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY ATHEISTS WANT TO HONOR LACK OF BELIEF AT GROUND ZERO. THOUGH I PERSONALLY THINK THE ENTIRE TRAGEDY ALREADY SUGGESTS THAT RELIGIOUS FERVOR SOMETIMES HAS A DOWNSIDE. JIM?
THEY SAY THAT IF THIS CROSS IS GOING TO STAND IF A MUSEUM THEY WANT TO HAVE A PLAQUE THAT HONORS ALL OF THE ATHEISTS WHO DIED ON 9/11 AS WELL.
Stephen: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, ATHEISTS, YOU SAY THE ONLY RESPONSE NECESSARY FOR NONBELIEVERS IN THE FACE OF THE NUMINOUS IS TO POINT OUT THE AWESOME GRANDEUR OF THE UNIVERSE, WITNESS THE SPLENDER OF  PIN-WHEELING GALAXIES, TO WONDER AT THE INTRICATE TAPESTRY OF LIFE AND TIME AND SAY THERE IT IS, AND HERE WE ARE, WE NEED NO GOD, BUT A PLAQUE WOULD BE NICE? (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I SAY THIS ATTACK ON THE 9/11 CROSS IS JUST THE LATEST SIGN THAT AMERICA IS GOING TO THE BOW WOWS. GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL IN 17 STATES. MEDICAL OR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA IS LEGAL IN 20 STATES. AND-- IN COLORADO YOU CAN NOW LEGALLY MARRY YOUR BONG. YOU MAY NOW TOKE THE BRIDE. AND FOLKS, I THINK I KNOW WHY. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY OF AMERICAN CHURCHES A QUARTER OF ALL CONGREGATIONS HAD FEWER THAN 50 PEOPLE IN THE PEWS, LEADING TO THE NEW CHILDHOOD GAME, HERE'S THE CHURCH, HERE'S THE STEEPLE, OPEN THE DOORS, THERE'S LIKE SIX PEOPLE IN THERE AT MOST. THAT'S NOT A LOT. AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BAD AMONG MEN. ACCORDING TO A RECENT ABC,  POLL WHILE 45% OF AMERICAN WOMEN GO TO CHURCH EACH WEEK, ONLY 34% OF MEN DO. LUCKILY, THERE'S A WAY TO BRING MEN BACK INTO THE FOLD AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PEW, PEW, PEW. FOLKS, AMERICA IS NO LESS OF A CHRISTIAN NATION THAN IT'S EVER BEEN, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE OLD METHODS OF PUTTING BUTTS IN THE WOOD SEATS DOESN'T WORK. JUST ASK KENTUCKY BAPTIST CHUCK McALISTER WHO SAID THE DAY OF HANGING A BANNER IN FRONT OF YOUR CHURCH AND SAYING YOU ARE HAVING A REVIVAL AND EXPECTING THE COMMUNITY TO SHOW UP IS OVER. EXACTLY. A BANNER DOESN'T CUT IT ANY MORE. YOU'VE GOT TO AT LEAST TRY A JESUS BLOWY MAN. (APPLAUSE) McALISTER HAS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO GET MEN INTO CHURCH.
HOST OF TELEVISION SHOW VENTURE BOUND OUTDOORS. WE'RE EXCITED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE AREA AT BAPTIST CHURCH ON THURSDAY MARCH 6th. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS IT. FREE ADMISSION, FREE STEAK DINNER AND GET THIS, 25 GUNS.
Stephen: 25 GUNS. (APPLAUSE) COME ON! NO OTHER RELIGION OUT THERE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH FREE STEAKS AND GUNS. WHAT ARE THE HINDUS GOING TO OFFER, A BOWL OF CHICKPEAS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IN A PREVIOUS LIFE YOU WERE A BOWL OF CHICKPEAS? (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE, FOLKS, PEOPLE USED TO GO TO CHURCH FOR A LOT OF REASONS. THEY WOULD GO FOR A SENSE OF COMMUNITY, UPHOLDING TRADITION, FINDING ANSWERS TO LIFE'S BIGGEST QUESTIONS. BUT THESE DAYS ALL OF THAT, ALL OF THAT IS JUST INTANGIBLE. AND THESE DAYS PEOPLE WANT SOMETHING MORE. PLUS--  (LAUGHTER) GIVING OUT FREE GUNS IS CONSISTENT WITH CHRIST'S MESSAGE. AS McALISTER REMINDED US, QUOTE, JESUS WAS PRETTY HANDY WITH THE WHIP WHEN HE RAN THE MONEY CHANGERS OUT OF THE TEMPLE. YES, YES, REMEMBER, JESUS USES A WHIP IN THAT GOSPEL STORY. BUT FOLKS-- PEOPLE, PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY DON'T USE WHIPS. NO, PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY, THEY USE GUNS. THEY LOVE GUNS. AS McALISTER KNOWS THAT IF YOU WANT TO REACH THEM, YOU NEED TO SPEAK GUN. OR AS McALISTER PUTS IT, HUNTING IS HUGE IN KENTUCKY SO WE GET IN THERE AND BURP AND SCRATCH AND TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS. AND THAT STUFF. YES. YOU GOT THE BURP AND SCRATCH ABOUT GOD LIKE THE WELL-KNOWN EVANGELIST LARRY THE CABLE SAINT. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE? FOLKS, DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE GUYS JUST LOVE? YOU KNOW WHAT GUYS LOVE OTHER THAN STEAKS AND GUNS? GUYS LOVE STRIPPERS AND UNLIMITED SHRIMP. I SAY FILL IN THE BAPTISMAL FONT WITH COCKTAIL SAUCE, SWAP OUT THAT GIANT CROSS FOR A BRASS POLE AND SWITCH OUT THAT COLLECTION BASKET FOR A COLLECTION G STRING. NOW THIS-- THIS MIGHT NOT--  (APPLAUSE) THE TRUTH IS THIS MIGHT NOT BE ALL KOSHER WITH THE BIBLE TEACHINGS. BY THE WAY, JEWS, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY GET GUYS INTO THE SYNAGOGUE, GRILLED PORK CHOPS. THE BOTTOM LINE, YOU GOT TO BRING MEN HOME TO JESUS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. EVEN IF THAT MEANS WEAPONS. REMEMBER, JESUS SAID ALL THOSE WHO TAKE UP THE SWORD SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD. AND IF CHURCHES GIVE OUT ENOUGH WEAPONS, WE CAN BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE HOME TO JESUS FOR GOOD. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
