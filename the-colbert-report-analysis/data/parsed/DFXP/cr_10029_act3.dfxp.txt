(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A SCIENCE JOURNALIST WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "FOCUS: THE HIDDEN DRIVER OF EXCELLENCE." THE UNHIDDEN DRIVER OF EXCELLENCE IS PAYING YOUR RENT. PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL GOLEMAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE A PSYCHOLOGIST, AN AUTHOR, A SCIENCE JOURNALIST AND YOU'RE MOST FAMOUS BOOK IS CALLED "EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE." IT SOLD OVER FIVE MILLION COPIES. WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE.
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE MEANS BEING INTELLIGENT ABOUT EMOTIONS.
Stephen: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? AREN'T BOOKS THEMSELVES LIKE YOUR BOOK ABOUT -- ISN'T THAT BOOK SMART NOT EMOTION SMART? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THE BOOK IS ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE YOUR EMOTIONS, HOW TO BE SELF-AWARE, HOW TO BE EMPATHIC, HOW TO TUNE INTO SOMEONE ELSE.
Stephen: BUT YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT EMOTIONS. YOU HAVE TO FEEL EMOTIONS, RIGHT? YOU HAVE TO PROJECT -- LIKE EMOTIONS -- LIKE I CAN'T READ ABOUT THAT, I'VE GOT TO READ YOUR FACE, ARE YOU LIKE ROLLING YOUR EYES OR GOING "I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME!"
THAT'S PART OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, PICKING UP CUES FROM PEOPLE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING.
Stephen: HOW AM I FEELING RIGHT NOW?
I THINK YOU'RE FEELING VERY SERIOUS. ARE YOU?
Stephen: I'M NOT IN TOUCH WITH MY OWN EMOTIONS. (LAUGHTER)
BUT IF YOU WERE EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT YOU WOULD BE.
Stephen: YOU WROTE AN ARTICLE THIS FALL IN THE OLD "NEW YORK TIMES," THE GRADY DI THERE CALLED "RICH PEOPLE JUST CARELESS." GUESS WHO HAS TWO THUMBS, A LOT OF CASH AND DOESN'T CARE THAT THESE AREN'T THUMBS, OKAY? (LAUGHTER) WHY AS A RICH PERSON -- HERE'S AN EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE. WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT -- WHY SHOULD I CARE? I'M RICH. I GOT MINE, JACK.
REASONABLE QUESTION. BUT THINK ABOUT BILL GATES. HERE'S A GUY WHO MADE MILLIONS, BILLIONS --
Stephen: BILL'S A FRIEND, BE CAREFUL.
AND HE SPENDS HIS TIME -- SOME OF HIS TIME -- GETTING TO KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY POOR AND GETTING TO UNDERSTAND THEM. HE SAYS IT MAKES THINGS VERY MEANINGFUL FOR HIM. ANOTHER REASON IS, YOU KNOW, THE POPE MAKES THE ARGUMENT THAT IT'S THE ETHICAL THING TO DO IS TUNE INTO PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR OR POWERLESS --
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. BUT THAT WAS THE REAL POPE. THE NEW SPOEP A FAKE POPE. ARE YOU A CATHOLIC?
NO.
Stephen: WELL, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT. THAT'S NOT A REAL POPE.
BUT I LIKE WHAT HE SAYS A LOT.
Stephen: OF COURSE, OF COURSE. WHAT IS THE EMPATHY GAP YOU TALK ABOUT? WE HAVE AN EMPATHY GAP IN AMERICA?
THE EMPATHY GAP SHOWS UP IN A LOT OF WAYS. IN CONVERSATION PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE POWER TEND TO PAY LESS ATTENTION TO THE PERSON WITH LESS POWER. IN E-MAIL-- VERY INTERESTING-- IN ORGANIZATIONS --
Stephen: I'M SORRY, WHAT? (LAUGHTER)
IN AN ORGANIZATION, LIKE IN A WORKPLACE, IN A BUSINESS, PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGHER IN THE HIERARCHY TAKE LONGER TO ANSWER E-MAILS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE LOWER IN THE ORGANIZATION. YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAP THE ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY BY HOW CAN IT TAKES PERSON A TO ANSWER PERSON B.
Stephen: WOW. I HAVE NEVER ANSWERED ONE E-MAIL. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: SO YOU MUST BE VERY POWERFUL.
TOP OF THE PYRAMID, MY FRIEND.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU FIX IT? I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE AWAY MY MONEY, DO ANY THAT'S A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. DO I HAVE TO NOT BE RICH HIM?
THE WAY TO HEAL A GAP BETWEEN ANY TWO GROUPS THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER IS CONTACT. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN BILL GATES GOES A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY AND MEETS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY, WHAT HE'S DOING IS HAVING THE KIND OF TIME WITH THEM AND UNDERSTANDING WITH THEM THAT LETS HIM KNOW HOW BEST TO HELP THEM.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME FLYING COMMERCIAL, ARE YOU? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE EVEN FIRST CLASS IS LIKE -- IT LOOKS LIKE THEY SHOT "12 MONKEYS" IN THERE. I HAVE TO FLY PRIVATE. I HAVE TO FLY PRIVATE STILL.
Stephen: WELL, IT MIGHT MEAN FLYING COMMERCIAL.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON A KING AIR 350-I?
NO.
Stephen: THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "FOCUS, THE HIDDEN DRIVER OF EXCELLENCE." I'M EXCELLENT. AM I FOCUSD?
THE MORE YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION. LIKE, FOR A KID, THE MORE YOU CAN DO YOUR HOME WORK AND DO THE GAMES, VIDEO GAMES, THE MORE YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE TEACHER IS SAYING AND NOT TEXT YOUR FRIENDS, TURNS OUT THAT'S THE BEST PREDICTOR OF YOUR FINANCIAL SUCCESS IN ADULTHOOD. BETTER THAN I.Q., BETTER THAN THE WEALTH OF THE FAMILY YOU GREW UP IN.
Stephen: IF I'M A RICH PERSON AND I GOT RICH BY FOCUSING, MAYBE THAT'S WHY I HAVE NO EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE I AM FOCUSED ON ME. (LAUGHTER) AND GETTING STUFF DONE. AND IF I HAD EMPATHY FOR OTHER PEOPLE I WOULDN'T BE SO FOCUSED ON MY SUCCESS.
Stephen: THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF EMPATHY. ONE IS COGNITIVE. WHICH IS UNDERSTANDING HOW PEOPLE THINK. ONE IS EMOTIONAL EMPATHY. THAT'S WHAT CREATES RAPPORT. THEN THERE'S A THIRD KIND WHICH IS EMPATHIC CONCERN. THIS IS THE POPE'S KIND WHERE YOU TUNE INTO PEOPLE AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR THEM YOU DO HELP THEM. AND ALL THREE KINDS OF EMPATHY MAKE OUR LIVES MUCH, MUCH MORE FULFILLED.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM AND YOU'RE ON THE TOILET THERE AND THERE'S A STRONG DESIRE TO READ SOMETHING LIKE A BOOK, YOU KNOW? OR THE BACK OF A SHAMPOO BOTTLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? IS THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE CAVEMAN DAYS WHEN WE WOULD GO TO THE BATHROOM WE'D BE VULNERABLE AND SUDDENLY OUR AWARENESS, OUR FOCUS BECOMES VERY BROAD FOR FEAR THAT THE TIGER IS GOING TO GET US AT THAT MOMENT OF VULNERABILITY? IS SOMETHING SQUIRTING IN MY BRAIN AT THAT MOMENT, SOME GLAND SQUIRTING THAT MAKES ME INTERESTED IN ANYTHING? BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IF I COULD CAPTURE THAT MOMENT OF FOCUS THAT I HAVE WHEN I'M ON THE TOILET AND READING I COULD TURN THAT INTO PILL, EVERYONE WOULD BE A GENIUS. (LAUGHTER) IS SOMETHING HAPPENING THERE?
I THINK SOMETHING IS HAPPENING BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT AND WE'D HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR BRAIN TO FIND OUT.
Stephen: WHEN ARE WE MOST FOCUSD?
TURNS OUT PEOPLE ARE MOST FOCUSED DURING SEX, NO SURPRISE. THEY'RE LEAST FOCUSED -- THE MIND WANDERS ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME. IT WANDERS THE MOST WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMMUTING, SITTING IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER TERMINAL.
Stephen: WHAT IF YOU'RE MAKING LOVE AT A COMPUTER TERMINAL?
IT WOULD PROBABLY AVERAGE OUT TO ABOUT 50%.
Stephen: WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR RESEARCH ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. DANIEL GOLEMAN. THE BOOK IS "FOCUS." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
