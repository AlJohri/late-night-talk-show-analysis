( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN  OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR WHO PLAYS  THE MANDARIN IN "IRON MAN 3".
MR. PRESIDENT, ONLY TWO  LESSONS REMAIN. I INTEND TO FINISH THIS BEFORE  CHRISTMAS MORNING.
MEET THOMAS RICHARDS. GOOD STRONG NAME, GOOD STRONG  JOB. THOMAS HERE IS AN ACCOUNTANT FOR  THE ROXON OIL CORPORATION, AND  I'M SURE HE'S A REALLY GOOD GUY. I'M GOING TO SHOOT HIM IN THE  HEAD.
LIVE ON YOUR TELEVISION IN 30  SECONDS.
Stephen:  NOT IF OBAMA  TAKES HIS GUN AWAY. ( LAUGHTER )  PLEASE WELCOME SIR BEN KINGSLEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HEY! NICE TO MEET YOU. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING. NICE TO HAVE YOU. I'M A BIG FAN. HOW ARE YOU?
AWESOME. AMAZING. FANTASTIC. SPECTACULAR. UNBELIEVABLE. GREAT. JUST AMAZING. FANTASTIC. WOW, AMAZING. AMAZING. FULL ON WOW. JUST GREAT. JUST GREAT. BOYS AND GIRLS I HAVE TO GET  THIS OUT OF MY SYSTEM BECAUSE  I'M GOING BACK TO THE U.K. THIS EVENING, AND IN THE U.K.-- ASK  ME AS AN ENGLISHMAN HOW I AM?
Stephen:  HOW ARE YOU?
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen:  YOU PLAY THE  MANDARIN IN THIS YOU SEEM TO BE  GOOD AT PLAYING THE BAD GUYS. YOU PLAYED LENIN. YOU PLAYED GANDHI, ALL OF THE  SERIOUS HEAVIES, YOU KNOW. DO YOU LIKE PLAYING A BAD GUY IN  THIS?
WHAT BAD GUY.
Stephen:  THE MANDARIN. HE'S A BAD GUY, RIGHT. HE'S THE HEAVY.
MR. COLBERT --
Stephen:  YOU CAN CALL ME  SIR STEPHEN. ( LAUGHTER )
LET ME GIVE YOU-- YOU KNOW,  YOU'RE PREEMPTED. SIR STEVEN SPIELBERG WAS  KNIGHTED. HE'S AN HONORARY KNIGHT.
Stephen:  I WAS KNIGHTED BY  QUEEN NOOR OF JORDAN.
THAT'S WONDERFUL. CONGRATULATIONS.
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH.
AND HOW ARE YOU REFERRED TO  IN JORD?
Stephen:  DO YOU ENJOY  BEING A KNIGHT?
LET ME GO BACK TO THE  PREVIOUS QUESTION.
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW IF  I'M GOING TO LET YOU.
AH, WELL, OKAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  GO BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS  QUESTION THERE, BENNY.
BOYS AND GIRLS, WHEN YOU'RE  PLAYING A VILLAIN, THE LAST  THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IS PLAY HIM VILLANCOUSLY. HE HAS TO HAVE A SENSE OF  RIGHTEOUSNESS. HIS POLITICAL MESSAGE IS HE HAS  TO BELIEVE IN HIS SENSE OF  RIGHT.
Stephen:  YOU HAVE TO DO  THIS, RIGHT?
NO, NO, I HAVE TOO MUCH  JEWELRY TO DO THAT. I'D SCRAPE ALL THE SKIN OFF MY  HANDS FIDID THAT.
Stephen:  WHAT IS THIS GUY  THE MAPPED RIN. AS I SAID, THE CHINESE MADE HIM  MAN DERREN. HE SEEMS VAGUELIATION. MAYBE A LITTLE ARAB. IS THERE ANY ETHNICITY WE CAN  OVERLAY ON BEN KINGSLEY? YOU PLAYED IT ALL.
I'VE NEVER PLAYED A GIRL.
Stephen:  REALLY.
THAT'S NOT AN ETHNICITY, I  KNOW.
Stephen:  NO.
BUT I AM-- I AM--  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  BUT I'M REALLY-- I'M MEETING YOU HALFWAY HERE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  BETWEEN MAN AND  WOMAN? YOU'RE MEET MEEG HALFWAY?
HOWEVER YOU WISH TO INTERPRET  IT.
Stephen:  LIKE, WHEN YOU  DID "GANDHI."  WHEN I WAS A KID I LOVED THAT  STORY.
WHEN WERE YOU A WHAT? SORRY. WHEN I WAS A KID. A CHILD. A VERY SMALL CHILD, WHEN YOU  WERE IN "GANDHI."
ARE WE MAKING FRIENDS NOW? WHAT ENDEARED YOU, I'M CURIOUS,  AS A CHILD, WHAT ENDEARED YOU?
Stephen:  FASHION, FASHION. HIS HOMESPUN IS WHAT I LIKED  ABOUT HIM. IT WAS MINIMAL. IT WAS MINIMAL--
WHEN-- WHEN HE VISITED HIS  MAJESTY KING GEORGE V, AND HE  WAS ASKED, "DID YOU THINK YOU WERE SUFFICIENTLY DRESSED TO  MEET HIS MAJESTY."  AND HE SAID, "HIS MAJESTY HAD  ENOUGH CLOTHES ON FOR BOTH OF US."  NOT BAD.
Stephen:  THAT'S NICE.
NOT BAD.
Stephen:  THAT'S QUICK.
NOT BAD FOR A BAD GUY IS  THERE NO. BUT THAT WAS, LIKE THE LAST  GREAT EPIC THAT ACTUALLY  HAPPENED, LIKE, WHEN THEY SHOT  IT. WHEN YOU SPOKE TO 20,000 PEOPLE  IN ONE OF THE SCENES, THERE WERE  20,000 INDIANS.
THERE WERE 400,000 AT  GANDHI'S FUNERAL.
Stephen:  BUT TODAY THAT  WOULD JUST BE DONE WITH  PING-PONG BALLS GLUED TO A GREEN  WALL.
YES, YES.
Stephen:  IN THIS MOVIE DID  YOU EVER ACT WITH ANOTHER ACTUAL  HUMAN BEING OR WAS IT ALL GREEN  SCREEN?
A LOT OF MY BROADCASTS,  MR. COLBERT, WERE TO THE CAMERA  AND, THEREFORE, THEY WERE BROADCAST TO WESTERN  CIVILIZATION.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND. SO NOT REAL PEOPLE?
REAL PEOPLE. OVER TO YOU. BUT REALLY, I DID HAVE SOME  SCENES WITH ROBERT. AND WITH BOBBY. NO, ROBERT.
Stephen:  HE ASKED ME TO  CALL HIM BOBBY. I'M A GOOD FRIEND OF HIS.
THAT'S FINE.
Stephen:  "CALL ME BOBBY"  HE SAID. HE SAID, "I TELL PEOPLE TO CALL  ME ROBERT IF WE'RE PROFESSIONAL  ACQUAINTANCES. BOBBY TO HIS FRIEND."  WERE YOU KNIGHTED? WERE YOU HONORED TO BE PART OF  AN ANCIENT TRADITION? OR WERE YOU THINKING, OH, MY  GOD. THERE'S A 76-YEAR-OLD WOMAN  HOLDING A SHARP BLADE NEXT TO MY  NECK?
THAT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND?
Stephen:  NO? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO FOR IT? DO YOU DO ANYTHING DURING THE  DAY? DO YOU HAVE TO GIVE A SPEECH? IS THERE A PARADE? IS THERE LUNCH WITH THE QUEEN? WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET  KNIGHTED.
MY KNIGHTHOOD WAS DESPOAD  UPON ME FOR MY SERVICES FOR  DRAMA.
Stephen:  I KNOW WHY YOU  DESERVE IT. YOU'RE A GREAT ACTOR.
I'M SORRY, I MISUNDERSTOOD  THE QUESTION.
Stephen:  I'M SORRY, MAYBE  I WAS--
IT'S A CULTURAL THING.   ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  I'M GOING TO GO  WITH YOU MISUNDERSTANDING. ( LAUGHTER )  DID YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING THAT  DAY. DID YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING IN  RETURN?
JUST SO YOU KNOW, JUST BE  NERVOUS. JUST HAVE SHAKY LEGS. THAT'S ALL. QUITE EASY, REALLY.
Stephen:  WELL, I-- I'VE  ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION. I FEEL LIKE PERHAPS IT WAS  HOSTILE AT TIMES. ( LAUGHTER )
I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY HOSTILITY.
Stephen:  OKAY, AND I  ACCEPT.
YOU'RE VERYIACEOUS.
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. YOU-- I-- READ-- AGAIN, WHEN I  WAS JUST A TYKE, I REMEMBER  READING YOU TALKING ABOUT YOUR OWN ACTING, AND YOU SAID  MAINLY-- LIKE, WHAT YOU FIRST--  FIRST IT WAS YOU GOTTA LEARN YOUR LINES. IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU DO FIRST  IS LEARN YOUR LINE?
I STUDY THE SCRIPT, YES, I  DO.
Stephen:  BECAUSE I'VE GOT  A LOT OF WORDS UP THERE ON THE  PROMPTER RIGHT THERE. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO MEMORIZE  ASKING BECAUSE THEY JUST PUT STUFF UP THERE FOR ME TO SAY.
WHEN YOU'RE LOOK AT THE  MONITOR YOU CAN'T LOOK AT YOUR  ACTORS.
Stephen:  YOU SAID YOU DID  SCENES INTO THE CAMERA.
BUT I DO HAVE SCEEBZ WITH  BOAB.
Stephen:  BEN THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME. SIR BEN KINGSLEY. SIT DOWN! CAN THE IRE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. NOW GET UP.
