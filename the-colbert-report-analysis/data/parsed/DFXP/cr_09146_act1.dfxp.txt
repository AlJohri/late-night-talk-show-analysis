EVERYTHING, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, BY J.D. SALINGER. STEPHEN!  STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, IN THE STUDIO AND ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU ARE JOINING US FOR AN HISTORIC EVENING.  THIS IS THE SECOND EDITION OF THE C-OLBERT BOOK CLUB. TONIGHT, WE ARE STEPPING AWAY FROM THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA, BECAUSE APPARENTLY THAT WAS THE UNITED STATES. A LOT OF DETAILS STILL TO BE WORKED OUT AND WE WILL GET INTO THOSE TOMORROW, BUT THE UPSHOT IS THAT AMERICA WILL NOT ATTACK SYRIA FOR GASSING ITS CITIZENS IF THEY GIVE UP THEIR CHEMICALS WEAPONS.
IT IS LIKE IF YOU DECAPITATE ADD CO-WORKER, SO THEY ARE TAKING AWAY YOUR AX. BUT YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR JOB AND YOUR HATCHETT.
BE GOOD NOW!  BE GOOD!  OKAY. ANYWAY, FORGET THAT STUFF. IT IS A DOWNER. LET'S GET TO THE BOOK CLUB. ALREADY IN PROGRESS.
NOW, AS YOU KNOW, I AM A POWERFUL MEDIA MOGUL. I HAVE GOT MY OWN SHOW, I HAVE GOT MY BEST SELLING BOOK. I HAVE GOT AN AWARD WINNING TWITTER FEED!  AND, OF COURSE, I HAVE MY MASSIVE DAILY E-MAIL BLAST OF THE INTERNET BEST FORWARDS. RITICS HAVE RAVED, UNSUBSCRIBE!  BUT I DON'T HAVE MY OWN NETWORK LIKE THE OWN NETWORK, WHICH IS OWNED BY OWN-PRAH WINFREY.
BUT NOW I DO HAVE THIS BOOK CLUB, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CHUGGING CHARDONNAY SINCE NOON. .. AND PITCHING ABOUT MY SISTER-IN-LAW SHARON AND THE WAY SHE FEEDS MY KIDS WHEN THEY ARE OVER AT HER PLACE. DON'T TELL ME THEY HAD DINNER IF ALL YOU GAVE THEM BUT A GOGURT AND A CLIFF BAR, YOU BITCH! [ APPLAUSE ]
SPEAKING OF DRINKING HEAVILY, F. SCOTT FITZGERALD. THAT IS THE AUTHOR WE TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME. TONIGHT, WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE BIGGEST INITIALS IN 20TH CENTURY LITERATURE, J.D. SALINGER. A MAN SO RECLUSIVE HIS FIRST TWO NAMES ARE STILL A SECRET. WAS IT JOE DON?  JUAN DIEGO?
JOE DA PLUMBER?
UNFORTUNATELY SALINGER CANNOT BE WITH US TONIGHT, EITHER MTV BOOKED HIM TO APPEAR ON THE VMA'S, OR -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: -- OR HE DIED IN 2010. ONLY TIME WILL TELL. BUT WE HAVE GOT A FANTASTIC SHOW LATER ON WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SALINGER'S LITERARY INFLUENCE WITH TOBIAS WOLFF, AUTHOR OF "THIS BOY'S LIFE" AND WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE NEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT SALINGER WITH ITS DIRECTOR SHANE SALERNO, WHO ALSO COWROTE THE 1998 BLOCKBUSTER, "ARMAGEDDON". WHICH IS WHY AT THE END OF THE DOCUMENTARY, SALINGER BLOWS HIMSELF UP TO SAVE BEN AFFLECK. TRUE STORY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THAT IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. NOW, SALINGER WAS FIERCELY PROTECT IF THE OF HIS PRIVACY SO LET'S INVADE HIS PRIVACY IN PART ONE OF MY ONE-PART SERIES, BETTER KNOW SALINGER.
J.D. SALINGER, THE WRITIN' J-D!  SALINGER WAS BORN IN -- SALINGER WAS BORN IN 1919 TO MIRIAM AND SAL, SALINGER, HE WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT, ENDED UP FLUNKING OUT OF THE MCBURNEY SCHOOL IN HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR, APPARENTLY HE HAD NOT READ THE SOPHOMORE BOOK ASSIGNMENT MAINLY BECAUSE HE HADN'T WRITTEN IT YET.  FROM THERE, SALINGER WENT ON TO MILITARY SCHOOL AND WAS EVENTUALLY DRAFTED INTO WORLD WAR II. HE WAS ON UTAH BEACH ON D-DAY, HE FOUGHT IN THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE AND LIBERATE ADD CONCENTRATION CAMP ALL THE WHILE WRITING SHORT SERIES THE THEMES OF ALIENATION, DEPRESSION AND LOS OF NEGLIGENCE. WHAT AN IMAGINATION!  WHILE IN GERMANY THE HALF JEWISH SALINGER ARRESTED A YOUNG NAZI OFFICIAL NAMED SYLVIA, WHO HE THEN MARRIED AND BROUGHT TO AMERICA. THE MARRIAGE LASTED ONLY EIGHT MONTHS AND ACCORDING TO SALINGER'S DAUGHTER FOREVER AFTERWARDS SALINGER REFERRED TO SYLVIA AS SALIVA. WHICH WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE KINDEST POSSIBLE WAY TO INSULT A NAZI. IN 1951, SALINGER RELEASED THE CATCHER IN THE TRY, THE STORY OF AN ADOLESCENT NAMED HOLDEN CAULFIELD WHO SKIPPED OUT IN SCHOOL, HEADS TO THE BIG CITY, WHERE HE GOES TO A JAZZ BAR, LOOKS FOR DUCKS IN CENTRAL PARK, TAKES IN A MUSEUM, CATCHES A CUBS GAME, JOINS A TWIST AND SHOUT AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT HOLDS, HIS DAD'S FERRARI FLIES OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO THE WOODS! [ APPLAUSE ]
SINCE THEN CATCHER HAS BEEN FEATURED IN THE MODERN LIBRARY AND TIME MAGAZINE'S LIST OF 100 BEST NOVELS SELLING OVER 65 MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THE JOY OF SEX SOLD ONLY 10 MILLION COPIES WORLDWIDE AND THE CATCHER IN THE RYE HAS NO SEX, AND EVEN LESS JOY.
NOTABLE FANS, NOTABLE FANS OF THE CATCHER IN THE RYE INCLUDE JOHN HINCKLEY, JR. WHO READ IT BEFORE SHOOTING RONALD REAGAN AND MARK DAVID CHATMAN WHO READ IT BEFORE SHOOTING JOHN LENNON, IT IS THE MOST VIOLENT REACTION TO A BOOK SINCE 1963'S TRAGIC RASH OF POP HOPPING.
IN THE FINAL 45 YEARS OF HIS LIFE, SALINGER DID NOT PUBLISH ANY NEW MATERIAL DESPITE REPORTEDLY WRITING EVERY DAY. THAT IS RIGHT. HE WROTE THINGS WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY SHARING THEM WITH THE WORLD AND I WILL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO TWEET HOW STRANGE THAT IS. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: NOW, THE ESTATE -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THE ESTATE OF J.D. SALINGER IS RUMORED TO BE PUBLISHING FIVE NEW BOOKS IN THE UPCOMING YEARS, THE BOOKS ARE SAID TO INCLUDE A BOOK ON EASTERN MYSTICISM, A COLLECTION OF GLASS FAMILY STORIES AND A PREQUEL TO HIS MOST FAMOUS WORK, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, THE PHANTOM MENACE. THOUGH I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE THE WORLD IS READY FOR JAR-JAR CAULFIELD.
HE IS A GODDAMN PHONY!
IN HIS LATER YEARS SAL JERRY THREATENED TO SUE JUST ABOUT ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTED TO ADAPT HIS WORK, BUT DO YOU SEE ME SHAKE, JERRY SO NOW I PRESENT TO YOU A DRAMATIC READING OF STEPHEN COLBERT'S J.D. SALINGER'S THE CATCHER IN THE TRY. LET ME JUST GET INTO CHARACTER WITH MY SCARF, MY RED HUNTING CAP, AND MY CAULFIELD CATCHER IN THE TRY, I THINK THAT IS THE KIND OF BOOK CAULFIELD WOULD CARRY AROUND. HERE WE GO. CHAPTER 1. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR -- â™ª
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO THE ESTATE OF J.D. SALINGER. HIS PUBLISHERS AT LITTLE BROWN AND COMPANY, AND, OF COURSE, PATRICK STEWART, WHOSE PERFORMANCE AS PHOEBE WILL NOW NEVER BE SEEN.
THIS HERE. SIGN THIS HERE, AND RIGHT THERE. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF COURSE, AS POPULAR AS CATCHER IN THE RYE IS, IT IS NOT THAT GOOD OF A BOOK. WHEN WE RETURN, MY GUEST AUTHOR TOBIAS WOLFF WILL DASH HIMSELF ON THE ROCKS OF MY CERTAINTY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
