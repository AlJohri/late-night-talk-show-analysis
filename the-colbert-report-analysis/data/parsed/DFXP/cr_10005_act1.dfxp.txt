(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE "REPORT." RIGHT OFF THE BAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NATION, I HAVE JUST RECEIVED BREAKING NEWS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. GOVERNMENT, STILL SHUT DOWN. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IS THE SHUTDOWN'S ONE-WEEK ANNIVERSARY AND I PLAN ON MARKING THE OCCASION BY POPPING A BOTTLE OF BUBBLEY. NOT CHAMPAGNE, MILK. (LAUGHTER) FOOD INSPECTORS HAVE BEEN FURLOUGHED AND -- (LAUGHTER) -- FOR SOME REASON MY MILK IS BUBBLING NOW. (LAUGHTER) NOW, EVER SINCE REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR THIS SHUTDOWN THEY HAVE KNOWN EXACTLY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.
THIS IS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S SHUTDOWN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SHUTDOWN.
THE OBAMA SHUTDOWN.
YOU WANT MY OPINION? THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SHUTDOWN.
Stephen: YES, IF YOU WANT STU VARNEY'S OPINION THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SHUTDOWN! AND IF YOU WANT STU VARNEY'S FACTS, WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO STU VARNEY? (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT IS STUBBORNLY REFUSING TO NEGOTIATE ON OBAMACARE EVEN THOUGH THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN VERY FLEXIBLE.
I'D LIKE TO REPEAL EVERY WORD OF THE LAW. BUT THAT WASN'T MY POSITION EVEN IN THIS FIGHT. MY POSITION IN THIS FIGHT WAS WE SHOULD DEFUND IT. EVEN NOW WITH THE WHAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS DONE IS A STEP REMOVED FROM DEFUNDING. IT'S DELAYING.
WE'VE BEEN PRETTY REASONABLE AS WE'VE WORKED THROUGH THIS PROCESS. I'VE HEARD THE REFERENCE TO A FULL DELAY OR A FULL REPEAL. NOW WE'RE JUST SAYING MR. PRESIDENT, CAN WE NOT JUST HAVE ONE-YEAR DELAY?
WE SAID, WELL, WHAT ABOUT A ONE-YEAR DELAY? WE'VE BEEN OFFERING COMPROMISE AFTER COMPROMISE. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT AND HIS MEN AND HIS WOMEN NO NEGOTIATION.
Stephen: NO NEGOTIATION, EVEN THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THOSE OFFERS IS A COMPROMISE FROM THE REPUBLICANS' INITIAL OFFER-- HAVING MITT ROMNEY BE PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) BUT SURPRISE SURPRISE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- SURPRISE SURPRISE, OBAMA WOULDN'T NEGOTIATE ON THAT, EITHER. (LAUGHTER) BUT ONE THING EVERYONE CAN AGREE ON IS THAT THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.
WE HAVE TO STOP PLAYING THESE FOOLISH GAMES.
WE HOPE THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WILL STOP WITH THE GAMES.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT PAWNS IN SOME POLITICAL GAME.
THIS ISN'T SOME DAMN GAME! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT! THIS ISN'T SOME DAMN GAME! IT'S THIS DAMN GAME: INTRODUCING "NOT A GAME." (LAUGHTER) THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN HOME GAME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FROM THE MAKERS OF "NOT STORY" AND "OPERATION DENIED DUE TO PREEXISTING CONDITION." (LAUGHTER) FOR PETE'S SAKE, WHAT INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD COVER GUY BORN WHAT LIGHTBULB FOR A NOSE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, NOT A GAME HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO REPLICATE THE FUN OF THE REAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. OKAY, YOU SEE, THE DEMOCRATS ARE A DONKEY, REPUBLICANS ARE AN ELEPHANT AND THE TEA PARTY IS A BUG UP THE ELEPHANT'S ASS. (LAUGHTER) NOW, THE SPOT -- THIS SPOT RIGHT OVER HERE, THIS IS THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION. YOU HAVE TO TRY TO PASS THAT. NOW, WHILE THIS TIMER RIGHT HERE REPRESENTS THE FAST-APPROACHING DEBT CEILING, SO YOU SET THAT AND THEN IGNORE IT. (LAUGHTER) AND THESE ARE PUBLIC OPINION CARDS THAT SAY HOW YOU'RE POLLING WITH THE VOTERS. OKAY? LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL. BRENDAN, GET ON OUT HERE. BRENDAN, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY, BRENDAN. BRENDAN, ARE YOU READY TO PLAY?
OKAY, HOW DO WE START?
Stephen: THE RULES ARE I GO FIRST AND I REFUSE TO TAKE MY TURN. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU CAN'T TAKE YOURS UNTIL I'M DONE.
WHAT?
Stephen: I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET BUT WE'RE BOTH AT FAULT HERE SO LET'S NEGOTIATE, OKAY? I WILL AGREE TO TAKE MY TURN IF YOU AGREE THAT I WIN.
THAT'S NOT FAIR! WHY EVEN PLAY THE GAME?
Stephen: IT'S NOT A DAMN GAME BRENDAN! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) PEOPLE'S JOBS ARE AT STAKE HERE. FOR INSTANCE, YOUR DAD. I FIRED HIM.
YOU DID?
Stephen: YES, HE IS NOT GETTING HIS JOB BACK UNLESS YOU AGREE TO PLAY WITH ME.
FINE, I'LL PLAY. JUST GO!
Stephen: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO I MOVE ONE SPACE AND I WIN. NOW, I JUST TAKE A PUBLIC OPINION CARD TO SEE WHAT VOTERS THINK OF ME AND "PUBLIC BLAMES YOU." GODDAMNIT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GET OUT! GET OUT, YOU CHEATER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU TELL YOUR DAD I'LL SEE HIM IN HELL! (LAUGHTER) NATION-- SEEMS LIKE A SWEET KID. (LAUGHTER) NATION, IT'S THE FIRST MONDAY IN OCTOBER, BACK-TO-SCHOOL DAY FOR THE SUPREME COURT. AND I AM THRILLED BECAUSE THE CASES THIS YEAR ARE TO DIE FOR. FOR INSTANCE, "BOND V. UNITED STATES." IT'S ABOUT A PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN NAMED CAROL BOND WHOSE HUSBAND KNOCKED UP HER BEST DIFFERENT SO BOND SPREAD LETHAL CHEMICALS ON HER FRIEND'S CAR, MAILBOX, AND DOORKNOB. THE DEAD GIVEAWAY WAS THAT ONE OF THE CHEMICALS-- POTASSIUM DICHROMATE-- IS BRIGHT ORANGE. IT'S THE REASON WHY NINJAS RARELY KILL WITH TRAFFIC CONES. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT WASN'T THE CRIME THAT GOT BOND ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. NO, IT WAS HER DEFENSE. HER LAWYERS ARGUE THE LAW SHE WAS CONVICTED UNDER IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON THE GROUND THAT IT INFRINGES ON THE POWERS RESERVED TO THE STATES UNDER THE 10th AMENDMENT. AMEN? I HAVE ALWAYS SAID CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE A STATE'S RIGHTS ISSUE. (LAUGHTER) EACH INDIVIDUAL STATE SHOULD DECIDE WHAT IS AND ISN'T POISONOUS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT WE IN MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA CONSIDER A DEADLY TOXIN PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA CALL "BARBECUE SAUCE." (LAUGHTER) BUT THE CASE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE CASE THAT'S REALLY GOT MY GAVEL IS "McCUTCHEON V. THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION." SHAUN McCUTCHEON IS CHALLENGING THE LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY $2,600 TO A SINGLE CANDIDATE AND AN OVERALL LIMIT OF $123,000 PER ELECTION CYCLE. FOLKS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TELL US HOW MUCH MONEY THERE CAN BE IN POLITICS ANY MORE THAN THEY SHOULD TELL US HOW MUCH RAT FECES DMB A HOT DOG! IT'S FINE AS LONG AS THE RATS KEPT KOSHER. (AUDIENCE REACTS) HERE TO TELL US HOW MUCH RAT FECES THERE'S GOING TO BE IN OUR POLITICS IS "SLATE" LEGAL EXPERT AND SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AT YALE LAW SCHOOL EMILY BAZELON. EMILY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. GOOD TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, EM. FIRST OF ALL, IS THE SUPREME COURT -- ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE A SESSION? ARE THEY ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL OR ARE THEY FURLOUGHED.
THEY SAY THEY'RE ESSENTIAL. THEY PUT OUT A PRESS RELEASE, THEY'RE HEARING ARGUMENTS ALL WEEK JUST THE WAY THEY'RE SCHEDULED.
SO THEY TOOK THREE MONTHS OFF AND THEY SHOW UP AND GO "WAIT, YOU NEED TO PAY US."
I THINK THEY WANT TO BE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE. THEY'VE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE.
Stephen: NOW, THE McCUTCHEON CASE. GIVE ME NUTS AND BOLTS HERE. WHAT ARE THE LIMITS NOW? $2600 PER PERSON AND $123,000. WHAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND NOT LETTING ME DONATE ALL I WANT?
THE LOGIC IS THAT IF YOU HAVE LIMITS YOU'LL HAVE LESS CORRUPTION. SO IF YOU COULD GIVE $2,600 TO AS MANY FEDERAL CANDIDATES YOU WANT IN A TWO-YEAR ELECTION CYCLE THEN SOMEONE COULD BUNDLE THE GIFTS TOGETHER. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO EXERT INFLUENCE. THEN YOU WOULD BE THE PERSON WITH THE POCKETBOOK WHO REALLY HAD THE INFLUENCE.
Stephen: WAIT. SO IF I GIVE POLITICIANS A LOT OF MONEY THEY MIGHT DO WHAT I WANT?
YES, AND WE WORRY ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: BUT THAT'S CORRUPTION!
EXACTLY. AND WE WORRY ABOUT THAT HAS THAT AS THE PROBLEM OF QUID PRO QUO. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.
Stephen: I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH. WHAT IS QUID PRO QUO? WHOSE SQUID IS THIS? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS GETTING SOMETHING FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU GIVE.
Stephen: BUT ALL WE'RE GIVING IS SPEECH BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT RULES THAT MONEY EQUALS SPEECH. AM I NOT WRONG?
WELL, AND THIS CASE, IF THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF SHAUN McCUTCHEON COULD REALLY CONTINUE THAT IDEA OF MONEY EQUALING SPEECH. BUT THE PART THAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT HAS GOOD REASON FOR PUTTING LIMITS ON THE MONEY. AND IN THIS CASE THERE'S A PROBLEM OF CORRUPTION WE JUST TALKED ABOUT AND THERE'S ALSO EQUALITY BECAUSE IF RICH PEOPLE CAN GIVE ALL THE MONEY THEY WANT THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DROWNING OUT EVERYONE ELSE'S.
Stephen: WELL, IF MONEY EQUALS SPEECH RICH PEOPLE SPEAK REALLY WELL AND POOR PEOPLE HAVE A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. (LAUGHTER)
AND WE WORRY ABOUT THAT PROBLEM.
Stephen: WHO IS "WE"? DO YOU HAVE A MOUSE IN YOUR POCKET? (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL. I'M WORRIED THAT MY SPEECH WILL BE IMPEDED BECAUSE-- SPOILER ALERT-- I'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY.
AND YOU'VE BEEN GOOD AT RAISING MONEY FOR ELECTIONS BUT CONGRESS WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU EXERTING TOO MUCH INFLUENCE ON THE PROCESS AND THEY WORRY ABOUT ALL THE REGULAR PEOPLE WHO CAN'T RAISE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND MAKING SURE THEIR VOICES ARE ALSO HEARD AND THAT THE CANDIDATES HEAR ABOUT THEIR VIEW.
Stephen: WELL, THIS COURT IS SUPER LIBERAL NOW, RIGHT.
IT IS NOT.
Stephen: THEY JUST APPROVED OBAMACARE, THUMB'S UP AND THEY SAID EVERYBODY'S GOT TO GET GAY MARRIED NOW. (LAUGHTER)
TRUE.
Stephen: TRUE! THAT'S TRUE! YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.
NO, THEY DIDN'T SAY EVERYBODY HAS TO GET GAY MARRIED.
Stephen: BUT IT'S RECOMMENDED.
NO, NO. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) NO, IT IS NOT. THEY SAID THAT FEDERAL LAW WILL GIVE FEDERAL BENEFITS TO GAY COUPLES WHO ARE MARRIED IN STATES THAT RECOGNIZE GAY MARRIAGE. THEY DID SAY THAT. BUT IT'S NOT A LIBERAL COURT.
Stephen: IT'S BEEN SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS SINCE A WHITE GUY WAS APPOINTED. THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIBERAL TO YOU?
I DON'T THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH LIBERAL.
Stephen: IT COMMUNITY?
NO, IT DOESN'T.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A WHITE GUY.
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE COURTS WE'VE HAD IN MODERN HISTORY.
WHICH WAY ARE THEY GOING TO SWING?
I THINK IT'S VERY LIKELY THE COURT WILL CUT BACK FURTHER ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER ROBERTS AND ALITO-- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS AND SAMUEL ALITO-- WILL GO AS FAR AS THE OTHER THREE CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY ARE REALLY, REALLY, NOT INTERESTED IN LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE.
Stephen: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? EVERYBODY THROUGHOUT SHOULD LISTEN TO THE SLATE POLITICAL GAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND WITHIN OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THAT UNTIL THIS PARTICULAR CRISIS PASSES THERE'S A SLATE ANN THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT EVERYDAY. I LOVE IT. IT PUTS ME RIGHT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. EMILY BAZELON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. EMILY BAZELON. SLATE, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
