Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT'S FIRST BLACK ECONOMY CONTINUES TO LET DOWN MY FRIENDS IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. [LAUGHTER] THE INCOME GAP BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES CONTINUES TO GROW, AND BLACK COLLEGE GRADUATES ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS THEIR PEERS TO BE UNEMPLOYED. EVEN WORSE, THEIR UNITED COLLEGE FUND STILL CALLS THEM NEGROES. COME ON! NOW, WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT, WE WERE PROMISED THAT RACISM WAS OVER, BUT FOR SOME REASON IT STILL EXISTS. I BLAME THE MEXICANS. [LAUGHTER] JUST TO SHOW YOU HOW BAD RACISM STILL IS, THIS MONTH'S ATLANTIC MAGAZINE IS ONE OF THE FASTEST-SELLING ISSUES IN ITS HISTORY THANKS TO MY GUEST, TA-NEHESIA COATES, ENTITLED "THE CASE FOR REPARATIONS." REPARATIONS? WHAT HAPPENED TO FORGIVE AND FORGET? WHITE PEOPLE HAVE DONE THE SECOND PART. NOW, LUCKILY, I THINK WE HAVE FOUND THE CURE TO RACISM THANKS TO A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OR PNES. THE STUDY WAS ON RACIAL PERCEPTION. SCIENTISTS CREATED A SPECTRUM OF FACES RANGING FROM WHITE TO BLACK, ALSO KNOWN AS THOMAS JEFFERSON'S FAMILY TREE. [LAUGHTER] BEFORE VIEWING ANY FACES IN THIS SPECTRUM, SUBJECTS WERE PRIMED TO THINK ABOUT SCARCITY BY THE SLIT-SECOND PROJECTION OF SUCH WORDS AS "SCARCE," "SPARSE" OR "LIMITED." THOSE PRIMED TO THINK ABOUT SCARCE OR LIMITED RESOURCES WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SEE SOMEONE WITH FEW AFRICAN FACIAL FEATURES AS BLACK. WHEN THE WHITE SUBJECTS WERE  SHOWN TWO FACIAL IMAGES AND TOLD TO DIVVY UP $15, THEY CONSISTENTLY SHORTED THE BLACK IMAGE WITH $7 OR LESS. TO RECAP: WHEN MONEY IS SCARCE, WHITE PEOPLE THINK EVERYONE LOOKS BLACK AND THEN WON'T GIVE THEM ANY MONEY, CONFIRMING RESULTS FIRST PUBLISHED IN PAUL RYAN'S BUDGET. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NATION, THIS STUDY PROVES WHITE PEOPLE DON'T DISCRIMINATE BECAUSE WE'RE RACIST. WE DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT ECONOMIC SCARCITY, WHICH MEANS THERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO ERADICATE RACISM IN AMERICA: GIVE WHITE PEOPLE MORE MONEY. THAT'S WHY, THAT'S THE REASON CONSERVATIVES WANT TO CUT TAXES FOR THE WEALTHY. WE'RE TRYING HEAL A WOUNDED NATION AND MAYBE FINALLY REACH MARTIN LUTHER KING'S MOUNTAINTOP, WHICH IN THIS CASE IS A PILE OF MONEY. WHEN WE COME BACK, I WILL ASK MY GUEST TA-NEHISI COATES FOR $10. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
