(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"). THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! IN HERE; OUT THERE; AROUND THE WORLD, WELCOME TO THE "REPORT," EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THIS, BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT EGYPT. THOSE GUYS HAVE GOT THEIR HEADS UP THEIR SPANX. (LAUGHTER) FIRST MUBARAK WAS IN, THEN MUBARAK WAS OUT. AND MORSI WAS IN, NOW MORSI IS OUT AND INSTEAD ARMY GENERAL AND GEORGE LOPEZ OF THE DESERT ABDEL FATTAH AL-SISI IS IN. AND WITH TENSIONS RUNNING HIGH, FOLKS, EVERYONE IS SUSPECTING EVERYONE ELSE OVER THERE AND I DON'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE THEY ALL LOOK KIND OF MIDDLE EASTERN. (LAUGHTER) BUT THANKFULLY THERE'S BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN EGYPT'S SECURITY SITUATION. FOR MORE WE TURN KTRT, HOUSTON'S EGYPT NEWS LEADER.
IN EGYPT, A STORK WAS BUSTED AS A SUSPECTED SPY. A CITIZEN THOUGHT THE BIRD WAS AN UNDERCOVER AGENT BECAUSE IT CARRIED A SUSPICIOUS ELECTRONIC DEVICE.
Stephen: "SUSPICIOUS ELECTRONIC DEVICE." COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE NEW IPHONE 5S? (LAUGHTER) AND I SAY THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE I WANT A FREE ONE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, DON'T BELIEVE THIS STORK IS A SPY? SOME SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THIS AGENT WAS INSTEAD A SWAN! WHICH MEANS THIS STORK HAS A SECRET IDENTITY, A NOM DE PLUMAGE. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE ANIMAL KINGDOM HAS GOT CAUGHT UP IN MIDDLE EASTERN ESPIONAGE. AS I REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, EGYPT ACCUSED ISRAELI AGENTS OF BEING BEHIND A LOCAL SHARK ATTACK AND -- (LAUGHTER). SAUDI ARABIA ARRESTED A VULTURE ON SUSPICION OF SPYING FOR ISRAEL. (LAUGHTER) AND THEY ALSO ARRESTED A RABBIT FOR BEING ONE LETTER AWAY FROM A RABBI. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, WHETHER HE TURNS OUT TO BE A SPY OR NOT, I CERTAINLY HOPE EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS INTERROGATE THIS STORK UNTIL IT REVEALS WHERE BABIES REALLY COME FROM. (LAUGHTER) VAGINAS, INDEED! (LAUGHTER) MAKES NO SENSE. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY BECAUSE ANYTHING BEATS TALKING ABOUT SYRIA. (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP, SYRIA. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE TO SAY THAT BARACK OBAMA HAS SCREWED THIS THING UP. (LAUGHTER) TURNS OUT I WAS WRONG. GIVES ME A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE-- BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE THIS IS BREWING INTO A CLEAR DISASTER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT.
IN THE SENATE, 29 ARE AGAINST MILITARY ACTION WITH 24 SUPPORTING A STRIKE. IN THE HOUSE, 238 MEMBERS ARE DEFINITE NO OR LEANING NO WITH ONLY 26 IN FAVOR.
Stephen: 6-10 AMERICANS OPPOSE THIS.
THE PUBLIC IS DEAD SET AGAINST THIS.
Stephen: CONGRESS KNOWS THAT THE ONLY THING LESS POPULAR THAN ATTACKING SYRIA IS CONGRESS. (LAUGHTER) SO CLEARLY CONGRESS MUST APPROVE AN ATTACK ON SYRIA! TELL THEM WHY, T.V. MAN.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS BUY-IN, RIGHT? HE MAY NOT GET IT. BUT IF HE DOES NOT GET BUY-IN ON THIS, CAN YOU IMAGINE ANOTHER PRESIDENT EVER GOING TO CONGRESS WITH THE SAME SORT OF REQUEST FOR USE IN THE SAME SORT OF FORCE? IT SETS A PRECEDENT FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
I THINK HE WILL GET HIS WAY ON THIS OR THE PRESIDENCY WILL WIN BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL -- THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL SAY "I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT."
Stephen: YEAH, I MEAN THE CONSTITUTION IS SUCH A HASSLE! (LAUGHTER) I KNOW THEORETICALLY THERE ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES AND STUFF BUT IF THE PRESIDENT ASKS FOR WAR APPROVAL, CONGRESS HAS TO SAY YES EVERY TIME HE ASKS! NO MATTER HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT IT OR ELSE THE PRESIDENT WILL STOP ASKING AND THEN CONGRESS WILL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY NO, WHICH THEY MUST NEVER DO. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE IF YOUR TEENAGE SON ASKS TO BORROW YOUR CAR. IF YOU SAY NO THIS TIME, NEXT TIME HE'LL ATTACK SYRIA. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) KIDS -- (LAUGHTER). NOW FACED WITH THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS OBAMA IS GETTING DESPERATE. YESTERDAY IN A ROSE GARDEN PRESS CONFERENCE HE TRIED TO DRAW ATTENTION WITH HIS SYRIA PLAN WITH ONE OF THOSE FLOPPY TUBE MEN. (LAUGHTER) THOUGH I'VE GOT TO SAY, THAT GUY HAS A FIRMER SPINE THAN JOHN KERRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHO THIS MORNING RALLIED SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT WITH THIS STIRRING BATTLE CRY.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAR. WE WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD BASHAR AL-ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE IN A VERY LIMITED, VERY TARGETED, VERY SHORT TERM EFFORT WITHOUT ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR. UNBELIEVABLY SMALL LIMITED KIND OF EFFORT.
Stephen: SO WATCH OUT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD! AMERICA IS GOING TO BRING DOWN THE UNBELIEVABLY SMALL HAMMER. (LAUGHTER) BUT, TO BE CLEAR, TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO AFFECT THE COURSE OF THE NAIL. (LAUGHTER) AND, FOLKS, AS BAD AS THEIR SALES PITCH IS, THEIR TIMING IS WORSE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CALENDAR NOW BECAUSE WHILE THE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT SYRIA AND THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING ON HIS MIND, AMERICANS HAVE THIS THING CALLED THEIR OWN LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL." (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: YES. AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST! THEY WANT VIOLENCE IN THE N.F.L.! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO OBAMA HAS BLOWN THIS WHOLE THING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE: HE SHOULD HAVE WATCHED FOX NEWS TO TELL HIM WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE. OR WHO HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
RONALD REAGAN IF HE WERE PRESIDENT, WE'D GET ASSAD LIKE THAT. HE WOULD. HE WOULD GET ASSAD. IF PRESIDENT REAGAN HAD LOOKED AT ASSAD AND SAID "DON'T YOU USE GAS OR YOU'RE GONNA PAY A PRICE" AND HE DID, REAGAN WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT IN.
I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD HAVE NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN. HE WOULD STAND UP TO THIS. WE HAVE TO THINK LIKE PRESIDENT REAGAN WOULD DO AND HE WOULD SAY CHEMICAL USE IS UNACCEPTABLE.
Stephen: YES, WE CONSERVATIVES HAVE AN UNCONDITION NEE ABILITY TO KNOW WHAT RONALD REAGAN WOULD DO AT ANY GIVEN TIME. (LAUGHTER) SYRIAN CONFLICT? INVADE. OBAMACARE? REPEAL. SOUP OR SALAD? JELLY BEANS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY WE KNOW, WE CONSERVATIVES KNOW THE GIPPER WOULD NEVER STAND FOR THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS-- TODAY. OF COURSE, IN THE 190s HIS ADMINISTRATION IGNORED CHEMICAL ATTACKS BY SADDAM HUSSEIN THAT KILLED THOUSANDS OF IRANIAN TROOPS AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY WHEN SADDAM GASSED HIS OWN KURDISH CITIZENS, BUT, REMEMBER, THAT'S THE OLD REAGAN. (LAUGHTER) WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICAL CONTEMPORARY SUPERREAGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE MAN WHO NEVER RAISED TAXES OR TRIPLED THE DEFICIT AND WHO KNOCKED DOWN THE BERLIN WALL USING HIS NUT SACK AS A WRECKING BALL. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S PIXELATED. (LAUGHTER) TRUE STORY, BY THE WAY. TRUE STORY. YOU KNOW WHAT? AS LONG AS WE'RE PLAYING FAN FICTION FOREIGN POLICY, WHAT IF OBAMA WERE REAGAN AND ASSAD WAS THE JOKER? AND INSTEAD OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS HE'S OPENING A JURASSIC PARK. OOH, OOH, WITH THE HELP OF SKELETOR! OKAY? AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, BUT NOT SO FAST BECAUSE REAGAN HAS BEEN BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE SPIDER AND NOW HE'S SPIDER-REAGAN! AND SKELETOR'S LIKE, YEAH, I'M SKELETOR, SEE, YEAH? I RUN THE MIDDLE EAST, SEE? AND SPIDER-REAGAN GOES "PEW, PEW, PEW. MR. SKELETOR, TEAR DOWN YOUR FACE!" AND HE'S LIKE "I'M DEAD, SEE?" AND EVERYBODY'S SAFE AND MY MOM LETS US STAY UP LIGHT TO WATCH "NIGHT RIDER." I LOVE YOU, SPIDER-REAGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHY CAN'T OBAMA DO THAT? (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
