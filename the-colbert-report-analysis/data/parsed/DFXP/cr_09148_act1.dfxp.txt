YOU KNOW ME, I DON'T ANGER EASILY. YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY UNFORGIVABLE LIKE DISAGREE WITH ME. WELL, TONIGHT I GOT A BEE IN MY BABUSHKA ABOUT PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE HAS WRITTEN AN ANTI-AMERICAN EDITORIAL IN TODAY'S "THE NEW YORK TIMES". FOLKS, IT'S NOT JUST IN THE TIMES, IT'S BEEN REPRINTED EVERYWHERE. IT EVEN MADE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE DRUDGE REPORTMENT AND I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE PICTURE THEY RAN WITH IT. HERE HE IS WITH HIS DIRTY VODKA-STAINED HANDS ALL OVER OLD GLORY. HMMMM, HMMMM. WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT PICTURE BEFORE? OH YEAH, IT'S MY PROMO SHOT FROM WHEN I STARTED THIS SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YEAH. THEY JUST PUT PUTIN'S HEAD ON MY BODY. AND CUT OFF MY ARM. MY ARMS. OH, OKAY. I COULDN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW THEY GOT THAT PHOTO. CLEARLY PUTIN'S BEEN STEALING PICTURES FROM MY FACEBOOK PAGE. UNFRIEND, ALL RIGHT. AND FOLKS, IT'S NOT THE ONLY PHOTO HE STOLE. LOOK, PUTIN HE IS DADE-- SEDATING A TIGER, NO, THAT'S ME AT THE BRONX ZOO. AND-- AND (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HERE I AM SHIRTLESS FISHING, SHIRTLESS HUNTING, SHIRTLESS HORSEBACK RIDING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EVEN THIS ONE OF PUTIN IS REALLY ME PRACTICING UNLICENSED DENTISTRY ON KEITH OLBERMAN. BY THE WAY, KEITH, YOU'RE DUE FOR A CLEANING. BUT I AM EVEN MORE FURIOUS WITH PUTIN ABOUT WHAT HE WROTE IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES". UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. I'LL GET TO IT LATER IN THE SHOW. SO UNTIL THEN I'LL NEED TO STORE MY RAGE WHERE IT WON'T SPOIL. HOLD ON, ONE SECOND. HERE WE GO. (SCREAMING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, GET OUT A SHEET OF PAPER AND NUMBER 2 PENCIL BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR A POP QUIZ. FOLKS WHAT DO CARROLL CHANNING AND JIMI HEN DIX DR. -- HENDRIX HAVE IN COMMON. WELL, THEY BOTH DROPPED A TON OF ACID AND WERE SENSATIONAL IN HELLO DOLLY. ALSO THEY BOTH HAIL FROM THE 74th INSTALLMENT OF THE 434 PART SERIES BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. TONIGHT WASHINGTON, 7th. THE 7th DISTRICT ENCOMPASSES THE CITY OF SEE AT EL, NICK NAMED THE EMERALD CITY BECAUSE IT'S HOME TO AN ALL-POWERFUL WIZARD WHO CAN GRANT ANYTHING YOU WISH AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE TO USE BINGE. SO FAR NO TAKERS. NOW IF YOU ARE'S PLANNING TO VISIT SEATTLE, PACK AN UMBRELLA BECAUSE THE CITY AVERAGES 140 RAINY DAYS A YEAR. IT ALSO EXPERIENCES 226 CLOUDY DAYS A YEAR SO DON'T FORGET TO ALSO PACK A NOOSE. (LAUGHTER) STARBUCKS OPENED ITS FIRST COFFEE SHOP IN SEATTLE IN 1971. AND NOW HAS OVER 11,000 LOCATIONS. FUN FACT, IF YOU STAND IN THE MIDDLE-- MIDDLE OF ANY STREET IN WASHINGTON'S 7th. LOOK TO YOUR LEFT THEN LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT. YOU WILL BE HIT BY A CAR, GET OUT OF THE STREET. (LAUGHTER) AND WHO HAS THE GRANDE FRAPPUCCINO'S TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT? WELL, NONE OTHER THAN THAN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN JIM McDERMOTT. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE McDERMOTT IN HIS WASHINGTON OFFICE.
CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTING 7th.
THE 7th DISTRICT IS A INTERESTING PLACE. SEATTLE IS A WONDERFUL PLACE IT HAS DRAWN PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: SIR MIXALOT IS ALSO FROM SEATTLE, CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU LIKE BIG BUTTS?
I'M SORRY.
Stephen: YOU CANNOT LIE, SIR.
TELL ME WHAT-- .
Stephen: WHEN A GIRL WALKS IF IN WITH A ITTY-BITTY WASTE AND-- IN YOUR FACE DO YOU GET STRUNG.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU ARE DRIVING AT.
Stephen: I WILL ASCERTAIN IN THE CLEAREST WAY POSSIBLE WHETHER YOU LIKE BIG BUTTS.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
Stephen: NO, OKAY. ON A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, YOU FAMOUSLY REFUSED TO SAY THE WORDS UNDER GOD IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE IN ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. WHAT DOW HAVE AGAINST GOD.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE WITH UNDER GOD IS WHICH GOD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MUSLIMS.
Jon: NO.
THE BUDDHISTS.
Stephen: NO, I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT, HIS NAME IS JESUS.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WORLD WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOU.
Stephen: THREE QUARTERS OF THE WORLD, ALL DUE RESPECT, IS WRONG. AND THEIR GOD IS NOT GOD. AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN A BAD WAY.
I ALWAYS BELIEVE IN FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY, EVERYONE IS FREE TO WORSHIP JESUS ANYWAY THEY WANT.
OR NOT.
Stephen: WELL, LET'S AGREE TO DISAGREE. LET'S MOVE ON. YOU ARE A REPRESENT ANY CONGRESS. YOU USED TO BE A PRACTICING PSYCHIATRIST. DO YOU ENJOY WORKING WITH THE MENTALLY DISTURBED? OR WOULD YOU RATHER BE A SCI TRUST? (LAUGHTER)
I THINK YOU PLAY HAVE MADE A JOKE. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ PEOPLE AND FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PERSUADE THEM TO DO THINGS.
Stephen: TELL ME WHAT THIS MEANS. LAST NIGHT HI A DREAM I WAS WALK THROUGH A REDWOOD FOREST, NO BRANCHES, JUST KIND OF STUMPS OF REDWOOD TREES. AND SUDDENLY A WOMAN CAME IN AND THE REDWOOD TREES WITHERED. AND FLOPPED OVER. AND THEN SHE LAUGHED AT ME. AND THEN THE PENIS CAME OUT OF THE SKY AND CRUSHED ME. (LAUGHTER) ANYTHING.
WHAT DID YOU EAT FOR DINNER?
Stephen: I HAD A BUNCH OF CALAMARI.
I WOULDN'T EAT THAT AGAIN.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU COSPONSORED LEGISLATION THAT TRIED TO END DOMA AND NOW THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECLARED DOMA UNCONSTITUTIONAL. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HELPED DESTROY MARRIAGE.
NO, I TRIED TO BRING FAIRNESS.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTRY.
Stephen: ARE YOU GAY MARRIED.
NO.
Stephen: OKAY. THEN AREN'T YOU KIND OF HYPOCRITICAL? BECAUSE YOU SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE BUT AREN'T WILLING TO TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP AND GET GAY MARRIED. WHERE I OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE AND I HAVE TAKEN THE STEP TO BE NOT GAY MARRIED.
PEOPLE WHO ARE GAY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT, GAY OR LESBIAN SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A SOCIETY FULLY.
Stephen: HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BEING GAY MARRIED. CONSIDERED IT FOR A MOMENT.
NO.
Stephen: NO, OKAY, THEY SHOULD GET MARRIED BUT EW, NOT ME.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, GAY IS YUCKY SAYS THE --
NO-- .
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
YOU ASKED ME A STRAIGHT QUESTION AND I GAVE YOU A STRAIGHT ANSWER.
Stephen: I ASKED YOU A GAY QUESTION. PROVE YOU SUPPORT GAY PEOPLE AND MAKE OUT WITH ME.
YOU ARE ASKING ME TO DO THINGS THAT I PROBABLY WOULD TO THE DO.
Stephen: OKAY, BECAUSE Y DO YOU NOT FIND ME ATTRACTIVE.
NO, I THINK YOU'RE AN INTERESTING MAN AND YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE, YOU'RE HANDSOME, WELL DRESSED.
Stephen: WHY WON'T YOU MAKE OUT WITH ME.
IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY ATTRACTION.
Stephen: IF YOU THINK I'M FAT JUST SAY SO.
I THINK THAT YOU WILL DECIDE WHETHER YOU ARE FAT OR NOT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK I THINK I'M FAT.
IF YOU SAY SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK, I DON'T PERCEIVE IT.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT, JUST SAY I'M FAT.
NO, I DIDN'T.
Stephen: YOU SDBS, YOU JUST SAID YOU THINK I THINK I AM. SO YOU MUST BE A REASON FOR YOU TO BE THINKING THAT.
I'M REALLY TRYING TO LET YOU DECIDE WHO YOU ARE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, OKAY. CONGRESSMAN, CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT A PHOTO I FOUND ON A WEB SITE OF YOU.
SURE.
Stephen: THIS PHOTO OF YOU WITH TAPE OVER YOUR MOUTH AND SOME SORT OF JAIRO GLIFS ON YOUR CHEEK, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A GAY GROUP HAD ME DO THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT THE ISSUE IS.
Stephen: ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU HAD A PHOTO SHOOT WITH A BUNCH OF GAY PEOPLE WITH DUCT TAPE AND YOU HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED.
THIS WAS ABOUT THREE MINUTES. THEY WALKED ME IN, PUT THE TAPE ON, PUT THE THING ON MY CHEEK, TOOK THE PICTURE AND I WAS GONE. I'M NOT QUITE CLEAR-- .
Stephen: I THINK YOU'RE GAY MARRIED NOW. I THINK ARE YOU GAY MARRIED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY PIKES PLACE MARKET WHICH IS IN SEATTLE, THEY-- SALMON AT EACH OTHER. WOULD YOU HELP LEE LIVE OUT A LIFELONG DREAM AND THROW SOME SALMON BACK AND FORTH WITH ME. GREAT, LET'S DO THIS THING. GREAT, LET'S DO THIS THING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
