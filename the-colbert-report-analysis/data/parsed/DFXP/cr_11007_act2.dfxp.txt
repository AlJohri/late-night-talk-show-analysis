STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I GOTTA GET OFF MY CHEST HERE AND I HOPE THIS DOESN'T COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANY OF YOU PEOPLE. BARACK OBAMA IS A COMPLETE FAILURE. IF HE IS SO COMMITTED TO FIGHTING TERROR WHY AM I NOW SEEING POP-UP STORIES FILLED WITH THINGS THAT SCARE ME. WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY, WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY, THIS GUY'S WORSE THAN JIMMY CARTER. DON'T BELIEVE ME? JUST ASK JIMMY CARTER.
EVEN JIMMY CARTER ON THE ATTACK TELLING A TEXAS NEWSPAPER THE PRESIDENT WAITED TOO LONG TO DEAL WITH ISIS.
HE SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY ON THE GROUND TO DIRECT OUR MISSILES, AND TO BE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TARGETS. THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO MOVE IN AND BE WILLING TO FIGHT ISIS AFTER THE STRIKE.
THAT'S PRESIDENT CARTER. HOLY SMOKES.
IT IS JAW-DROPPING. THERE IS SIMPLY NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.
STEPHEN: I HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO PUT IT-- JIMMY CARTER JUST KICKED OBAMA FROM THE PEANUT POUCH. OH, SNAP, OBAMA. YOU JUST GOT MALAISED! BEING CALLED A WUSS BY JIMMY CARTER? THAT'S LIKE F.D.R. BEATING YOU AT KICK BALL. AND NOWHERE, NOWHERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NOWHERE HAS OBAMA BEEN WEAKER THAN IN THE REALM OF STRATEGIC NOMENCLATURE.
PAST PRESIDENTS WHEN THEY'RE AT WAR GIVE THE WAR A NAME. THEY CALL IS OPERATION DESERT SHIELD, OPERATION DESERT STORM.
HE HASN'T NAMED THE WAR YET. TO ME THAT'S ASTOUNDING.
WE HAVEN'T NAMED THE WAR YET, THE NON-WAR WAR.
STEPHEN: THAT'S RIGHT, OBAMA HAS REFUSED TO NAME THIS OPERATION EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN LAUNCHING AIRSTRIKES FOR TWO MONTHS. IN HIS HEY DAY, P. DIDDY COULD COME UP WITH FOUR NEW NAMES IN THAT TIME. I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLD THAT HE IS NOW DUFF PADDY. AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHY OBAMA REFUSES TO PICK A NOM-DE-BOOM.
THEIR MISSION REMAINS NAMELESS. IS IT BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT AMERICA IS, INDEED, AT WAR.
PRESIDENT HAS NOT GIVEN NAMES TO THE SYRIA OR IRAQ OPERATIONS AND THAT'S UNUSUAL AND MAY REFLECT THE PRESIDENT'S OWN AMBIVALENCE OVER A WAR HE DOES NOT WANT FIGHT.
UNNAMED QUOTE FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, ACCORDING TO A SOURCE, "IF YOU NAME IT YOU OWN IT." AND THEY DON'T WANT TO OWN IT. WHO'S "THEY?"
YES WHO'S THE THEY WHO WON'T OWN THE WHAT ACCORDING TO WHOEVER AT THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" WON'T NAME. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ANSWER ME, OBAMA. BECAUSE BILL HEMMER IS NOT CONVEYING INFORMATION OF ANY KIND. AND A REAL LEADER-- A REAL LEADER WOULD STEP UP AND GIVE THIS MISSION A TITLE THAT WOULD RALLY THE PUBLIC, LIKE WHEN COLIN POWELL NAMED THE 1989 INVASION OF PANAMA, OPERATION JUST CAUSE. NOT-- NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH HIS TITLE FOR THE 2003 INVASION OF IRAQ, OPERATION JUST CUZ. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN THE FIRST MILITARY INTERVENTION IN 25 YEARS WITHOUT A CODE NAME. NOW, IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE OUR "CHIN-STROKER-IN-CHIEF" WANTS TO AVOID AN EMBARRASSING ACRONYM HERE, LIKE PAST REJECTED CODE NAMES, OPERATION AFGHANISTAN FREEDOM, WHICH SPELLED OAF, BY ACCIDENT. OR OPERATION IRAQ LIBERATION, WHICH SPELLED OIL. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT SO FAR, THE ONLY ACTUAL NAME MILITARY PLANNERS HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE PENTAGON WAS OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE. WHICH WAS REJECTED BECAUSE, AS ONE MILITARY OFFICER PUT IT, IT WAS JUST KIND OF BLEH. ( APPLAUSE ) I AGREE. I AGREE. ALTHOUGH, GIVEN THE MOOD OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, I MIGHT GO WITH OPERATION KIND OF BLEH. I MEAN, HOW HARD CAN THIS BE? JUST LOOK AT THE GREAT NAMES WE'VE COME UP WITH IN THE PAST. OPERATION SHARP EDGE, OR OPERATION VIGILANT RESOLVE. EITHER ONE OF WHICH COULD BE A GREAT SLOGAN FOR VIAGRA. SO IF BARACK OBAMA WON'T STEP UP AND NAME THIS MISSION, I WILL. I HOPE THAT HISTORY WILL REMEMBER STEPHEN COLBERT AS THE MAN WHO HAD THE COURAGE TO NAME THE WAR HE WAS NOT WILLING TO FIGHT IN. SO LET'S HEAD OVER TO THE NAME CHAMBER 5,000. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME. WELCOME TO THE NAME CHAMBER. WELCOME TO THE NAME CHAMBER 5,000, A NAME WE GOT OUT OF THE NAME CHAMBER 4,000. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. OKAY I HAVE TWO TYPES OF SLIPS OF PAPER IN THERE. THE RED SLIPS HAVE DESCRIPTIVE WORDS LIKE "JUST," "SWIFT" OR "PAISLEY." THE BLUE SLIPS HAVE POWERFUL NOUNS LIKE "EAGLE," OR "LIBERTY" OR "EMMA," WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR GIRL'S NAME OF 2014. I'M GOING TO GET IN THERE, GRAB ONE OF EACH AND FINALLY SETTLE THE DEBATE OVER THE NAME OF THE WAR WE HAVE NEVER DEBATED. JIMMY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BLOW ME! ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, BARACK OBAMA. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BARACK OBAMA, I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING. FROM NOW ON, WE'RE FIGHTING OPERATION SWOLLEN PANTHER FROM NOW ON, WE'RE FIGHTING OPERATION SWOLLEN PANTHER OR OPERATION TURGID HAMMER. OR RECKLESS CHAINSAW. OR WE COULD STRIKE FEAR IN THE HEART OF OUR ENEMIES WITH OPERATION LUXURIOUS PULL TAB. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
STEPHEN: YOU'RE WELCOME. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
STEPHEN: THERE'S A BUNCH OF GOOD NAMES, MR. PRESIDENT. OKAY, SO PLEASE LET'S PUT SOME SACK IN THIS TACK. THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD ONE, OPERATION SACK ATTACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
