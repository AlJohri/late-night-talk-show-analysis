STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I TELL YOU, WITH A WELCOME LIKE THAT, WAS THAT NOT A WELCOME? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE TONIGHT. FOLKS, WITH THAT KIND OF WELCOME IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU KNOWS WHAT'S COMING. FOLKS, HUGE NEWS TONIGHT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF NEW JERSEY CHRIS CHRISTIE, IS IN HOT WATER. OKAY, HOLD ON, I JUST PICTURED HIM IN A HOT TUB. SHAKE IT OFF. NEW E-MAILS LINK TOP AIDES IN THE CHRISTIE ADMINISTRATION TO A SHUTDOWN ON THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE BACK IN SEPTEMBER. IT WAS TRAFFIC ON A BIBLICAL SCALE WITH NEW JERSEY HIGHWAYS BACKED UP FOR DAYS WHICH IS SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN NORMAL. (LAUGHTER) NOW IT TURNS OUT, TURNS OUT, FOLKS, THAT THE LANE CLOSURES WERE MEANT TO MAKE LIFE HELL AS PAYBACK TO THE MAYOR OF FORT LEE NEW JERSEY FOR NOT ENDORSING CHRISTIE FOR RE-ELECTION. NO WORD YET ON WHAT THE REST OF NEW JERSEY IS PAYBACK FOR. (LAUGHTER) NATION, I, I WILL HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE ON THIS TOMORROW BY WHICH I MEAN JUST ME, OF COURSE. AND REST ASSURED, I'M GOING TO GO EXTREMELY EASY ON THIS MAN. BECAUSE I AM A COMMUTER AND DO NOT WISH TO GET ON HIS BAD SIDE. NOT TO IMPLY THAT HE HAS A BAD SIDE. ALL YOUR SIDES ARE WONDERFUL SIR! NOW NATION, IT'S IMPORTANT, I HOPE YOU KNOW THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO TALK TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DRUGS. BUT THAT CAN BE NERVE-RACKING, SO BEFORE YOU DO POP SOME XANAX, IT HELPS. THIS IS CHEATING DEATH WITH DR. STEPHEN T COLBERT, DFA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AS ALWAYS, FOLKS, TEAM DEATH IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS, PRESCOTT, LOOK FOR US IN YOUR SPAM FOLDER. TONIGHT ON CHEATING DEATH, FIRST UP, MEDICAL  MINIATURIZATION.  ("HELP ME") FOR YEARS NOW SCIENTISTS HAVE THEORIZED THAT THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE LIES IN NANOTECHNOLOGY. USING MICROSCOPIC ROBOTS TO FIGHT ILLNESSES AND DISEASE, RECENTLY RESEARCHERS MADE A MAJOR MINIATURE BREAKTHROUGH IN THEIR ABILITY TO CONTROL THESE MINI MD'S BY CREATING THE FIRST CYBORG SPERM REMOTE CONTROLLED USING MAGNETS. SCIENTISTS WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BY GETTING INDIVIDUAL SPERM TO ENTER TINY MAGNETIZED NANOTUBES. NOW THE OBVIOUS DOWNSIDE OF MAGNETIZED SPERM IS THE DANGER OF WATCHING PORN AND ACCIDENTALLY ERASING YOUR-- BUT THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THESE LITTLE CYBERSPERM COULD BE USED TO HELP FERTILIZE AN EGG OR DELIVER DRUGS TO VERY SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE BODY. FOR INSTANCE, IT COULD DELIVER ANXIETY MEDICATION RIGHT TO YOUR BRAIN WHICH YOU WILL NEED AFTER LEARNING THAT THERE IS SPERM IN YOUR BRAIN. (LAUGHTER) AND IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH A STRANGER'S ROBO SPERM PUSHING DRUGS AROUND YOUR BLOODSTREAM, REST ASSURED IT ISN'T SOME RANDOM PERSON'S SPERM, IT'S RANDOM BULL SPERM. (LAUGHTER) YEAH. SO LADIES, THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S HELP FOR YOUR INFERTILITY. THE BAD NEWS YOU'RE HAVING A MINITAUR. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO BUILD YOU A LABYRINTH. (LAUGHTER) WELL I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS CYBERBABY BATTER CRAZE PASS ME BY. WHICH IS WHY I'M GRABBING THE BULL SPERM BY THE HORNS AND TEAMING UP WITH PRESCOTT PHARMACEUTICALS TO LAUNCH AN UPGRADE TO MY BEST SELLING LINE OF BABY BATTER, FORMULA 401 BY INTRODUCING FORMULA 401 OH ONE OH ONE OH OH ONE. IT IS RADIO CONTROLLED SPERM THAT YOU KNOW IS CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE EACH BATCH OF CYBERSEED WAS PRODUCED IN THE CORNER OF A LOCAL RADIO SHACK. (LAUGHTER) BELIEVE ME, THEY'RE HAPPY JUST TO HAVE ANYONE IN THERE NOWADAYS. SIDE EFFECTS OF FORMULA 401 OH ONE OH ONE OH OH ONE INCLUDE MATHLETE'S FOOT. INVOLUNTARY JOWL MOVEMENTS AND GLAND OF THE LOST. NEXT UP, HEALTH TECHNOLOGY. WE ALL KNOW-- THANK YOU, SKELLY. WE ALL KNOW OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. JUST LOOK AT ANY NEWSPAPER HEADLINE FROM WHEN THE WEB SITE WASN'T WORKING. LUCKILY, NOW THERE'S A FREE MARKET SOLUTION TO SEEING A DOCTOR WITHOUT THE CRIPPLING BURDEN OF HAVING INSURANCE. JIM?
WELCOME TO DR. ON DEMAND. THE DOCTOR ON DEMAND APP LETS YOU HAVE AN IMMEDIATE FACE-TO-FACE CONSULTATION WITH A REAL BOARD-CERTIFIED LICENSED PHYSICIAN WHO CAN DIAGNOSE YOU AND PRESCRIBE MEDICATION.
THIS DOCTOR IS ONE OF ABOUT 1,000 DOCTORS NATIONWIDE TREATING PATIENTS VIA APP.
THIS IS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH. MEDICAL EXPERTISE WITH THE CONVENIENCE OF A SMART PHONE. WHY WASTE TIME GETTING AN EXAM WHEN YOU CAN JUST SHOOT YOUR DOCTOR AN EMOJI OF YOUR SHATTERED FEMUR. GOT A LITTLE SUNGLASSES, ISN'T THAT COOL? (LAUGHTER) WITH DR. ON DEMAND YOU FACETIME WITH A DOCTOR FROM YOUR COMPUTER, SMART PHONE OR TABLET WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR ANYONE WITH AN IPHONE, AN ANDROID OR A PUBLIC LIBRARY WHERE THEY CAN PRESS THEIR JUNK UP AGAINST A WEB CAM.

IT'S DESIGNED TO MODERNIZE THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM BY USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE A SIMPLE DOCTOR'S VISIT STRESS-FREE FOR PATIENTS AND DOCTORS ALIKE. YES, IT'S LESS STRESSFUL FOR EVERYONE. DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR DOCTOR ENJOYS CUPPING YOUR BALLS? NO. NOW HE CAN WATCH YOU DO IT YOURSELF. AND HEY, IF YOU GET REALLY GOOD AT IT, I KNOW A SITE THAT WILL PAY YOU $40 TO DO IT ON CAMERA. (LAUGHTER) AND ONCE YOU CONNECT WITH A DOCTOR YOU CAN EVEN UPLOAD PHOTOS FOR THEM TO EXAMINE. IN FACT, THE ONLY THING YOU CAN'T DO IS SEND A STOOL SAMPLE. LEARNED THAT ONE THE HARD WAY. RUINED A PERFECTLY GOOD HEADPHONE JACK. CLEARLY, CLEARLY APP-BASED HEALTH CARE IS THE FUTURE OF MODERN MEDICINE. AND PRESCOTT WILL NOT BE OUTFUTURED. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE PROUD TO INTRODUCE A BRAND-NEW APP, IT'S CALLED HEALTH ROULETTE. FOR JUST $20 YOU CAN GET A 30 SECOND FACE-TO-FACE CONSULTATION WITH A CERTIFIED MEDICALLY AWARE HUMAN AND MEMBER OF THE HEALTH ROULETTE COMMUNITY. WILL IT BE A DOCTOR? MAYBE. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED HEALTH ROULETTE. SIMPLY PRESS CONSULT AND YOU HAVE LOGGED IN TO YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENT. OKAY, HELLO THERE. I HAVE GOT A LITTLE RASH ON MY HAND, DOES THAT LOOK RED AND SWOLLEN TO YOU?
I DON'T KNOW. DOES THIS LOOK RED AN SWOLLEN? (LAUGHTER)
