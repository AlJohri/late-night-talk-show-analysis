STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOU  PEOPLE DOING HERE? SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT  CELEBRATING? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  BECAUSE EVIDENTLY, YOU DON'T  LISTEN TO ANYTHING I SAY! I'VE BEEN BRINGING YOU THE TRUTH  FOR SEVEN YEARS, AND HOW DO YOU  REPAY ME? FOUR MORE YEARS OF HOPI-CHANGE. ( APPLAUSE )  WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU THINK I DO THIS NIGHT AFTER  NIGHT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT? I DO IT FOR AMERICA. WHAT'S THE POINT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( SIGHS )  ( LAUGHTER )
WHO THE WIN THE $10,000  PRIZE? ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )   ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen:  OKAY, APPARENTLY,  I AM CONTRACTUALLY OBLIIGATE TO  DO A SHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU  VERY MUCH. OKAY, UM, ALL RIGHT, FINE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S-- AH, LET'S DO  THIS. UM, SO, IF I HAVE TO, I HAVE TO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG  ELECTION. LAST NIGHT, DUE TO THE  TECHNICALITY CALLED THE  CONSTITUTION, BARACK OBAMA WAS  RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT. THOUGH--    ( CHEERS )   ( APPLAUSE )  UH. ( BLEEP ) YOU. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  NOW, FOLKS, KEEP IN MIND, KEEP  IN MIND, THIS WAS NO LANDSLIDE,  FOLKS. IT WAS LIKE A 51-49ER, OKAY. JUST BECAUSE OBAMA WON THE BLUE  STATES UP HERE, HE'S THE  PRESIDENT OF ALL OF THEM NOW? ROMNEY WON ALL THAT RED STUFF. WHY DON'T WE ELECT OUR PRESIDENT  ON SQUARE FOOTAGE, BECAUSE  ROMNEY WON SOME BIG STATES, FOLKS, WHOLE DAMN SOUTH. LOUISIANA, N'AWLINS LOVES  MI-RAWMNAH. BUT, BUT, EVIDENTLY, HERE'S THE  DEAL. OF THE NINE KEY SWING STATES,  BALM WON EIGHT. I DON'T-- I MEAN HOW-- EVEN  PENNSYLVANIA. DESPITE THE FACT THAT AFTER A  WEEK OF HURRICANE SANDY,  THOUSANDS OF AMISH REMAIN WITHOUT POWER. ( APPLAUSE )  ANYWAY, ANYWAY, OBAMA WON. AMERICA IS DONE. IT'S OVER! JIMMY, ROLL THE CREDITS.  ♪ ♪ ♪  ( "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL" )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I'LL TELL YOU, FOLKS, THERE'S A SIMPLE REASON WHY AMERICA IS  OVER. BECAUSE LAST NIGHT'S ELECTION  WASN'T DECIDED BY REAL  AMERICANS.
IT'S A CHANGING COUNTRY. THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHANGING. IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL AMERICA  ANYMORE. AND THERE ARE 50% OF THE VOTING  PUBLIC WHO WANT STUFF. ( LAUGHTER )  THEY WANT THINGS. AND WHO IS GOING TO GIVE THEM  THINGS? PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IS NOW  THE MINORITY.
Stephen:  YES, TRADITIONAL  AMERICA IS NO MORE, OKAY. THAT'S ALL AMERICAN TRADITIONS. NO MORE TRICK-OR-TREATING. NO MORE HOMECOMING. WHEN SOMEONE SNEEZES YOU HAVE TO  SAY "HAPPY HOLIDAYS."  FOLKS, PAPA BEAR, PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY IS RIGHT. THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT, GUYS  LIKE US, WE'RE THE MINORITY NOW,  AND WE'RE HELPLESS AGAINST THIS TIDE OF NON-WHITE PEOPLE WHO  WANT STUFF AND THINGS. ( LAUGHTER ). THEY'RE THE THING-STUFF-WANTERS. WHEREAS TRADITIONAL WHITE PEOPLE  OF ANY RACE WE DON'T WANT  THINGS. WE HAVE THINGS. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  OKAY?   ( CHEERS )   WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THINGS. WE KEEP IT WITH OUR STUFF. AND IT'S NOT JUST WHITE AMERICA  THAT'S ENDANGERED. IT'S ALSO MAN-MERICA. JUST ASK MSNBC NEWS DABBLER  JOHNNY DOITCH19 FEMALE SENATORS  OUT OF 100. THAT'S WHERE AMERICA'S  DEMOGRAPHICS ARE HEADED. 20% WOMEN. THIS IS WHY I HAVE SAID WE HAVE  TO CLOSE OUR POROUS BORDERS HAVE  VAGI-STAN. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I  CAN NEVER FIND THE CAPITAL OF  THAT PLACE  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT. THOSE GUYS OVER THERE KNOW WHAT  I'M TALKING ABOUT. PLUS, FOLKS, THE WHOLE-- THE  WHOLE-- THE WHOLE ELECTION WAS  MARRED BY VOTER IRREGULARITIES. FIRST OF ALL, EAST COAST GOT TO  VOTE THREE HOURS EARLIER. THAT CAN'T BE FAIR. ( LAUGHTER )  AND THEN THERE WAS THAT ONE  PLACE WHERE THAT ONE BLACK GUY  WAS. THAT'S SCARY STUFF. AND THAT WASN'T THE ONLY TRICK  THE LIBERALS PULLED.
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS. A MURAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA  WATCHING OVER VOTERS FOR HOURS  AT ONE POLLING PLACE IN A  SCHOOL. ONLY AFTER COMPLAINTS WAS IT  PARTIALLY COVERED UP.
THAT'S SOMETHING THEY WOULD  EXPECT, MAYBE IN CHINA OR  OLD-STYLE RUSSIA BUT NOT IN THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen:  YES, BECAUSE  VOTERS ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO  WHATEVER THEY SEE ON HIGH SCHOOL WALLS WHICH IS WHY IN 2008, NEW  HAMPSHIRE VOTED IN GOVERNOR  "JEREMY PLUS ABBY 4-EVA." ( APPLAUSE )  ( LAUGHTER )  AND, NATION, I GOTTA TELL YOU,  YESTERDAY MY OWN VOTING EXPERIENCE LEFT MUCH TO BE  DESIRED. FOR ONE THING, MY BOOTH WAS  COMPLETELY OUT OF TOILET PAPER. ( LAUGHTER ). NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I  PULLED THAT LEVER IT WOULDN'T  FLUSH, OKAY. I JUST GOT THE HELL OUT OF  THERE. I SAW ALL SORT OF VOTE  IRREGULARITY. YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO CAMPAIGN  WITHIN 100 FEET IN FRONT OF A  POLLING STATION BUT I SAW COUNTLESS SIGNS TELLING ME TO  VOTE FOR A GUY NAMED AQUI. THAT DOESN'T SOUND AMERICAN. THAT DOESN'T SOUND AMERICAN TO  ME. AND THE ILLEGAL ELECTIONEERING  WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE BALLOT  ITSELF. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHAT, DID  VOTERS HAVE TO DO ON THEIR  SCANTRON SHEETS? FILL IN AN "O."  WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT BEFORE? AND NO SURPRISE, IT STARTS OUT  WHITE AND YOU'RE FORCED TO FILL  IT IN BLACK. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  OKAY, YOU'RE NOT FOOLING  ANYBODY! THAT'S THE DEMOCRATS' GAME. AND, OF COURSE, THE DEMOCRATS  HAD TO MAKE UNSUBSTANTIATED  CHARGES THE REPUBLICANS TRIED TRICKS, TOO.
REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST EVERY  LEGISLATIVE EFFORT, AND SO  THEY'RE RESORTING TO THEIR OLD-SCHOOL TACTICS.
SO THIS IS THE "VOTE BY  PHONE" SCAM REPORTED IN  RICHMOND, VIRGINIA PURPOSE VOTERS TARGETED WITH FALSE  INFORMATION ON ABILITY TO VOTE  BY PHONES, ESPECIALLY SENIORS, RECEIVING CALLS AND BEING TOLD  THAT THEY CAN VOTE BY PHONE.
HUNDRED, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF  ROBO CALLS WENT OUT THIS MORNING  REMINDING VOTERS THEY HAVE UNTIL 7:00 P.M. TOMORROW NIGHT TO  VOTE. NOT THE CASE. 7:00 P.M. TONIGHT IS THE  DEADLINE.
Stephen:  FOLKS, I DON'T  BUY TOKAY. FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULDN'T WORK. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE ELECTION WAS  YESTERDAY, AND THEY KNOW YOU  CAN'T VOTE OVER THE PHONE. EVEN IF OLD PEOPLE GOT THAT CALL  THEY WOULD NEVER--  ( PHONE RINGING )  I'M SORRY. HOLD ON. THAT'S MY PHONE, HOLD ON. HELLO?
ONE.
Stephen:  HOLO, WHO IS THIS  PLEASE?
ONE. ONE. ONE.
Stephen:  WHO IS THIS?
IT'S WILFORD, WILFORD  BRIMLEY.
Stephen:  WILFORD, WILFORD,  WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M TRYING TO DO'S SHOW HERE.
I'M VOTING BY PHONE. I GOT A CALL YESTERDAY TELLING  ME I COULD VOTE TODAY AS LONG AS  I DID IT OVER THE PHONE. ALL I HAD TO DO WAS PUSH OR SAY  "ONE."
Stephen:  WILFORD--
ONE.
Stephen:  WILFORD WHY DID  YOU CALL ME? I GOT YOU ON THE SPEED GUILE  DIAL. YOU'RE ONE.
Stephen:  WILFORD YOU CAN'T  VOTE BY PHONE. HOW DARE YOU SUPPRESS MY VOTE  AIRFARE SERVED MY COUNTRY. I WAS A RODEO CLOWN.
Stephen:  I KNOW, WILFORD,  I KNOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, BUT  I'M NOT--
FINE, I'LL VOTE BY FAX. ( TONE DIALING ).
Stephen:  YOU CAN'T VOTE BY  FAX, EITHER.
HELP! ONE! ONE!
Stephen:  WILFORD BRIMLEY,  EVERYBODY. TRY TO GET HIM BACK ON THE  PHONE. WILFORD, ARE YOU OKAY? ( CHEERS AND AP
