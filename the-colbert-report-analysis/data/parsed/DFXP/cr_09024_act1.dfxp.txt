IS SNUPT TONIGHT, DO GOVERNMENT  OFFICIALS MAKE GOOD ROLE MODELS  FOR OUR KIDS? WELL, THEY DON'T MAKE GOOD ROLE  MODELS FOR OUR ADULTS. (LAUGHTER)  AND MY GUEST, FORMER SPEAKER  NEWT GINGRICH HAS A NEW NOVEL  ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON. I CANNOT TELL A LIE-- I HAVE NOT  READ IT. (LAUGHTER)  DUKE UNIVERSITY HAS DEVELOPED A  WORKING INVISIBILITY CLOAK. NOW THE BLUE DEVILS QUIDDICH  TEAM WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE! (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS THE "THE COLBERT  REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE "REPORT."  CHAUSZ  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. PLEASE, NATION, WE HAVE A BIG  SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST IS NONE OTHER THAN  FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE  AND CURRENT MOON GOVERNOR NEWT  GINGRICH. (LAUGHTER)  TWO TITANS OF SOUTH CAROLINA  POLITICS GOING HEAD TO HEAD. BUT WHO CAN FORGET WHEN GINGRICH  SWEPT THE SOUTH CAROLINA  REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND I RAN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  OF SOUTH CAROLINA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SADLY, SADLY, FOLKS, I HAD TO  SUSPEND MY CAMPAIGN ON THE  TECHNICALITY THAT I DO NOT WANT THAT JOB AND IT DOES NOT EXIST. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, FOLKS, ALL THAT'S BEHIND US  NOW. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF 2012  IS FINALLY OVER. AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELENTLESS  POLL ANALYSIS, ELECTORAL MAP  SWIPING, UNDECIDED VOTER DIAL TESTING AND BEING FORCED TO USE  THE WORD "CUYAHOGA" IN A  SENTENCE --  (LAUGHTER) -- WE CAN FINALLY TAKE A  BREATHER. JUST RELAX WITH A NICE SOOTHING  CUP OF CAMOMILE BREEZE AND JUST  LET IT ALL --
DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO EARLY  TO TALK ABOUT 2016? WE DON'T THINK SO. (GUNSHOT)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: (BLEEP) YOU! I'VE HAD IT! I'M A HUMAN BEING GODDAMNIT! I HAVE RIGHTS! CAN'T WE JUST MOVE ON TO SOME  OTHER ASPECT OF OUR LIVES? NOT EVERYTHING IS A CONSTANT  CONTEST FOR POLITICAL ADVANTAGE! AMERICA'S FACING SOME SERIOUS  PROBLEMS! THERE ARE TIMES TO RUN AND THEN  THERE ARE TIMES TO GOVERN! WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER, LET IT  GO, MOVE ON, GOD! (APPLAUSE)  (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS?
THE PUBLIC POLICY POLLING  SURVEY ASKED IOWA DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS LAST WEEK WHOND THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS THEIR  NOMINEE. FOR THE DEMOCRAT, HILLARY  CLINTON THE OVERWHELMINGLY TOP  PICK. 58%. FOLLOWED BY JOE BIDEN. FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THEIR TOP  FAVORITES MIKE HUCKABEE, CHRIS  CHRISTIE, MARCO RUBIO, PAUL  RYAN.
Stephen: YES, 2016 IS ON! (LAUGHTER)  WHICH MEANS ANY MOMENT NOW  ARIZONA SHOULD BE FINISHED  COUNTING THEIR 2012 BALLOTS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO TELL  YOU, THIS 2016 THING IS REALLY  PRE-HEATING UP. BUT I SAY WHY STOP AT 2016? (LAUGHTER)  I NEED TO KNOW THE EARLY  FAVORITES FOR 2020. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW IS CHELSEA CLINTON STACKING  UP AGAINST TAG ROMNEY? (LAUGHTER)  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WILL TAG BE  ABLE TO WARD OFF A LAST-DITCH  CHALLENGE BY MITT ROMNEY? (LAUGHTER)  OH, HE'S RUNNING. AND AS AMERICA'S PREMIER NEWS  READER, IT'S MY DUTY TO STAY WAY  WAY AHEAD OF THESE RACES. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO  LAUNCH MY COVERAGE OF ELECTION:  2072, RACE TO THE WHITE OR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BROUGHT TO YOU BY VIRTUAL OLIVE  GARDEN. (LAUGHTER)  WHEN YOU'RE TECHNICALLY NOT HERE  YOU'RE FAMILY. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, SO FAR, IN 2072 LOOKS LIKE  IT'S GOING TO BE A MATCHUP  BETWEEN ROBOCHENEY VERSUS A SWARM OF SENTIENT NANO HORNETS. THOSE NANO HORNETS ARE GOING TO  BE TOUGH TO BEAT, FOLKS, BECAUSE  I HEAR THIS WEEKEND THEY WERE SWARMING AN IOWA PANCAKE  BREAKFAST. (LAUGHTER)  AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUES ALL  ACROSS CABLE NEWS, I WILL STAY  ON THIS STORY BEFORE IT EVER  HAPPENS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOLKS, THE IF I PASS  JUDGMENT LIKE I PASSED KIDNEY  STONES IT'S GOING TO HURT LIKE HELL AND YOU'LL BE WALKING  FUNNY. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FIRST UP, FOLKS, HAPPY DUALI  WHICH I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU IS THE HINDU FESTIVAL  OF LIGHT. A FIVE-DAY HOLIDAY STARTING  TODAY ON DONTERA, CELEBRATED ON  THE 13th LUNAR DAY OF KRISHNA PAKSHA OF THE HINDU CALENDAR  MONTH OF USHWIN. CELEBRATED ON THE SECOND LUNAR  DAY OF THE HINDU CALENDAR MONTH  OF PARTHEEK. YOU KNOW, DUALI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, WE'VE ALL ALREADY BEEN  BOMBARDED BY DUALI COMMERCIALS FOR WEEKS NOW. AT LEAST UNTIL WE'VE TAKEN DOWN  THE VIJAY DASHAMI DECORATIONS. DALI IS WHEN HINDU FAMILIES  LIGHT CLAY LAMPS AND SET  FIRECRACKERS TO SCARE AWAY EVIL SPIRITS AND OCCASIONALLY  FINGERS. (LAUGHTER)  THEY MAY COME TO AN END BECAUSE  THE INDIAN PRESIDENT IS CALLING  FOR A POLLUTION FREE DIWALI WITH BANGALORE ASKING CITIZENS TO  REFRAIN FIRE FROM FIREWORKS  AFTER 10:00 P.M. TO LIMIT AIR AND NOISE POLLUTION. FOLKS, MY TANDOORI POT DOTH BOIL  OVER WITH RAGE PANEER. SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER  TO THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA. FOLKS, THIS JERK IS JUST ANOTHER  LIBERAL NON-BELIEVER RUINING THE  TRUE MEANING OF DIWALI. FIRST THEY TOOK THE CHRIST OUT  OF CHRISTMAS. NEXT THEY'RE TAKING THE CHRIST  OUT OF DIWALI. I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S IN THERE  SOMEPLACE. THESE PEOPLE WORSHIP A LOT OF  GODS. THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE OUT THE  ONE WHO'S FAMOUS? I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT'S NEXT, A SET OF WISHING  SOMEONE THE TRADITIONAL DWALI KI  HAARDEEK SHUM? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WISH  THEM A HAPPY HOLIDAY? NOT ON MY WATCH. NEXT UP, DID YOU KNOW THAT AS WE  SPEAK MILLIONS OF AMERICAN MEN  DO NOT HAVE AN ERECTION? (LAUGHTER)  IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP  OF MY HAT TO SCIENTISTS IN  BRAZIL WHO HAVE DISCOVERED AN ALTERNATIVE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION  DRUG DERIVED FROM THE VENOM OF  THE BANANA SPIDER. (LAUGHTER)  YOU SEE THEY TESTED THE DRUG AND  FIND THAT IT HELPED HELDERLY  RODENTS OVERCOME ERECTILE  DYSFUNCTION. AT LAST, A SOLUTION TO THE  DWINDLING RAT POPULATION. (LAUGHTER)  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE DRUG HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR HUMANS JUST BECAUSE BANANA  SPIDER VENOM CAUSES LOSS OF  MUSCLE CONTROL, BREATHING PROBLEMS, PARALYSIS AND PAINFUL  ERECTIONS IN MEN. SO YOU MIGHT DIE, BUT AT LEAST  YOUR FAMILY WON'T HAVE TO SHELL  OUT FOR A TOMBSTONE. (LAUGHTER)  FINALLY FOLKS, I'M NO FAN OF  "SESAME STREET". THEY EXPOSE OUR CHILDREN TO  DANGEROUS LIBERAL IDEAS LIKE  BEFRIENDING THE HOMELESS, TWO MEN SLEEPING IN THE SAME BEDROOM  AND COUNTING. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IN A RECENT SEGMENT, THE  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SONIA  SOTOMAYOR, THESE PUPPETGANDAIST WENT TOO FAR.
WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU ALL  ABOUT THE WORD CAREER.
I WANT A CAREER AS A  PRINCESS. A REAR! TADA!
ABBEY, PRETENDING TO BE A  PRINCESS IS FUN, BUT IT IS  DEFINITELY NOT A A REAR. REMEMBER, A A REAR IS A JOB THAT  YOU TRAIN AND PREPARE FOR AND  THAT YOU PLAN TO DO FOR A LONG TIME
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I GUESS A PRINCESS ISN'T REALLY  A JOB.
NO, IT'S NOT.
OF COURSE BEING A PRINCESS IS  A JOB! (LAUGHTER)  YOU REALLY THINK A PEN ZELL JUST  WOKE UP WITH THAT HAIR? YOU DON'T GROW A 30-FOOT BRAID  FREE OF SPLIT ENDS WITHOUT A  VERY SERIOUS CONDITIONING  REGIMEN. (LAUGHTER)  SO A WAG OF MY FINGER AT JUSTICE  SONIA SOTOMAYOR FOR CRUSHING THE  DREAMS OF LITTLE GIRLS  EVERYWHERE. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE TELLING HER SHE CAN'T BE  A PRINCESS BECAUSE IT'S A LONG  SHOT IN IN THIS ECONOMY ANY JOB IS A PIPE DREAM. (LAUGHTER)  ASK YOURSELF THIS: WHAT'S MORE  LIKELY, THAT YOU'LL EAT A  POISONED APPLE AND AWAKE TO THE KISS OF A CHARMING PRINCE OR  THAT YOUR ENGLISH DEGREE WILL  LAND YOU A SECOND INTERVIEW WITH  STAPLES? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  EITHER WAY YOU'RE GOING TO SHARE  AN APARTMENT WITH SEVEN  ROOMMATES. (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT DOES JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR  THINK IS A GOOD CAREER. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE GUESS.
DO YOU HAVE A CAR REAR?
YES, I DO. I AM A UNITED STATES SUPREME  COURT JUSTICE.
OKAY. THAN I KNOW WHAT A REAR THAT I  WANT TO HAVE.
WHAT'S THAT?
CAREER! ORDER IN THE COURT!
OH, ABBEY, I THINK YOU'LL  MAKE A GREAT, GREAT JUDGE.
SURE, TELL LITTLE GIRLS TO  BECOME SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. NEVER MIND THAT IN THE COURT'S  220 YEAR HISTORY ONLY FOUR WOMEN  HAVE REACHED THE BENCH. MEANWHILE, EIGHT DIFFERENT  AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE MARRIED  PRINCES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND THAT IS NOT EVEN INCLUDING  THE EIGHT WOMEN WHO MARRIED LARRY KING. (LAUGHTER)  DARE TO DREAM, LITTLE GIRLS. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES THE JOB OF PRINCESS AND  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, ARE THEY  REALLY SO DIFFERENT? YOU'RE BOTH PLUCKED FROM  OBSCURITY, GIVEN A LIFETIME  APPOINTMENT WHERE YOU HOLD COURT WEARING FANCY ROBES AND YOU'RE  CONFINED TO CLOSE QUARTERS WITH  AN ANGRY BEAST. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
