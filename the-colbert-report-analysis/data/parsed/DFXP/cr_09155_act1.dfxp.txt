Stephen:  TONIGHT, CABLE NEWS BRINGS BACK A CLASSIC SERIES. COULD IT BE A ROCK 3. A ROCK HARDER. THEN I REVIEW AN EXCITING CHILDREN'S BOOK. I DON'T CARE HOW HUNGRY THAT CATERPILLAR IS. IT'S NOT GETTING FOOD STAMPS. AND MY GUEST CHRIS FISHER IS A CONSERVATIONIST WHO TRACKS GREAT WHITE SHARKS. A FLIGHT WAS GROUNDED BECAUSE THERE WAS A SNAKE ON THE PLANE. IT'S JUST LIKE THE SAMUEL L. JACKSON MOVIE, DJANGO UNCHAINED.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU, SO MUCH. THANK YOU IN THERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. AND BY "US" OF COURSE I MEAN US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE A FAMILY NOW BECAUSE I'VE ADOPTED THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) COME TAX TIME I WILL BE CLAIMING THEM AS DEPENDENTS. IN ADDITION TO BEING HONORED ON THE EMMYS, I WAS PROMPTLY FEATURED ON A TELEVISION SHOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY WATCH.
YOU AWAKE?
YEAH.
WE HAVE BEN & JERRY'S, WENUT BUTTER CUP, AND AMERICONE DREAM.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT. MY ICE CREAM. AMERICONE DREAM. THE ONLY ICE CREAM LIKED BY SOCIOPATHIC WHITE STREM SIFTS. IT DOES KEEP THE VANILLA SEPARATE FROM THE CARAMEL. THIS IS THE BIGGEST CUE SINCE "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS" ENDORSED NIVEA. FOLKS, I BELIEVE-- IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME THEY DID THIS AFTER ALL THE TIMES I HAVE PLUGGED THEIR PRODUCT "THE BLUE." UPON WHAT MIGHT PUT YOU IN THE MINDSET FOR MAYHEM? A NICE BIG BAG OF METH. SOME OF THE TASTY BLUE. HEY, I PLUG WHAT THE NETWORK TELLS ME TO. SOMETIMES IT'S DORITOS. SOMETIMES IT'S 92% PURE METHAMPHETAMINE. BOTH MADE BY GUYS IN HAZMAT THE SUITS. AND, FOLK,S THEY DON'T JUST MENTION MY ICE CREAM ON "BREAKING BAD." IT HAS A KEY ROLE IN THE PLOT. BEFORE MY ICE CREAM, JESSE CAN'T REACH THE BARS OF HIS CIENL, BUT AFTER EATING MY ICE CREAM, HE CAN LEAP LIKE AN EAGLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE HE GOT THAT ENERGY. EVERY PINT OF AMERICONE DREAM IS MADE WITH LOVE. AND METH. ( LAUGHTER ) I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO COMPETE WITH JIMMY FALLON'S "LATE NIGHT SMACK." ( LAUGHTER ) AND, FOLKS, TO CELEBRATE THE CULTURAL IMPACT OF AMERICONE DREAM AS WELL AS THE SERIES FINALE OF THIS SHOW, MONDAY NIGHT MY GUEST WILL BE "BREAKING BAD" CREATOR VINCE GILLIGAN. SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT, FOLKS -- WE ARE GOING TO SPOIL EVERYTHING. SO WATCH IT SUNDAY NIGHT. NOW, NATION THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN THAT POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BECOME TOO POLARIZED AND OVERHE WANTED. WELL, I HOPE THOSE PEOPLE GET SHOT. I FOR ONE LOVE A GOOD ARGUMENT, AND THAT IS WHY I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT THE RETURN OF CNN'S "CROSSFIRE" WHICH BACK IN THE 80s PRACTICALLY INVENTED PEOPLE YELLING INCOHERENTLY AT EACH OTHER. I LOVE WATCHING PEOPLE FLY OFF THE HANDLE. THAT'S WHY MY FAVORITE SHOW IS THE RETURN DESK AT BEST BUY. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND UNTIL THE REVAMPED "CROSSFIRE" APPEARED EARLIER THIS MONTH, THE ONLY PLAES YOU COULD FIND INTRACT EBL POLITICAL SHOUTFEST WAS EVERYWHERE ELSE ON CAPABLE NEWS. AND I KNEW THIS NEW "CROSSFIRE" WAS GOG DELIVER AS SOON AS I SAW THE PROMO. SERVATIVES AND LIBERALS LIBERALS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY TO ADVANCE OW VIEWS AND THEY'RE NOT THE SAME.
I AM GOING TO SCIS OF DISAGREE WITH YOU PAUSE I THINK YOU'RE ALL WRONG.
Stephen:  DID YOU CATCH THAT, THE ALL NEW CROSS-FIRE RETURNS. EVEN THE TAG LINE IS ARGUING WITH ITSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW "CROSSFIRE."
