Stephen: TONIGHT, THE  HISTORIC SECOND INAUGURAL OF  VICE-PRESIDENT BIDEN. THEN, AMERICA GETS THE FLU. THE RATINGS FOR "THE PRICE IS  RIGHT" HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. AND I'LL DISCUSS OBAMA'S SECOND  TERM WITH EDITOR FOR THE  ATLANTIC, TA-NEHISI COATES. WHICH ONE OF US WILL BE BLACK? THE ANSWER MAY SURPRISE YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] ATARI FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY TODAY  BUT THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT JUST  TAKING IT OUT, BLOWING ON IT, AND SEEING IF IT'LL WORK AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL    PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. [CHOWD CHANTING SEE IT FEN] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S SIMULCAST. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLKS, AS A BROADCASTER, IT'S MY  SACRED RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING  YOU THE LATEST INFORMATION THAT I WATCHED ON SOME OTHER CABLE TV  NETWORK. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FRANKLY, TODAY THERE WAS NO  REAL NEWS TO REPORT. INSTEAD EVERBODY WAS OBSESSED  WITH SOMETHING THEY KEPT  CALLING--
SECOND INAUGURATION OF BARACK  OBAMA.
SECOND INAUGURATION.
SECOND INAUGURATION.
Stephen: WRONG. CHECK YOUR CONSTITUTION.
"PRESIDENT SHALL BE  INAUGURATED ON JANUARY 20th. -4-  STEPHEN COLBERT IS RIGHT. LOVE, THE FOUNDING FATHERS."  HE ALREADY TOOK THE OATH  YESTERDAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE! BY TAKING IT AGAIN TODAY, OBAMA  HAS MADE HIMSELF A THREE-TERM  PRESIDENT SERVING THE SECOND TWO TERMS CONSECUTIVELY. NOW TO GET RID OF HIM WE HAVE TO  IMPEACH HIM TWICE  OH, CLEVER GIRL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND BESIDES, IT'S HIS SECOND  INAUGURAL. WHY THE CELEBRATION? HE'S ALREADY PRESIDENT. YOU DON'T SEE THE REST OF  AMERICA THROWING A PARTY WHEN  THEY CONTINUE TO DO THEIR JOBS. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL ADMIT, I WAS SWEPT UP FOUR  YEARS AGO, I WAS MOVED BY THE  FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT COME ON, A SECOND INAUGURAL  IS LIKE PEOPLE WHO RENEW THEIR  WEDDING VOWS. WE GET IT, YOU'RE MARRIED! I'M NOT BUYING YOU ANOTHER SALAD  BOWL. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE NOTHING, NOTHING WE GIVE  OBAMA IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO  SATISFY THIS MAN'S GREED. LOOK AT HOW HE SWOAR IN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL ACTUALLY  USE THREE DIFFERENT BIBLES. ON SUNDAY, FOR THE OFFICIAL  SWEARING IN, HE WILL USE THE  ROBINSON FAMILY BIBLE. ON MONDAY FOR THE PUBLIC  INAUGURATION, HE WILL USE THE  LINCOLN BIBLE AND  MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.'S, TRAVELING BIBLE.
Stephen: THAT'S A FREAKY  BIBLE THREE-WAY! AND IT'S SO TRANSPARENT THAT OLD  HOLLYWOOD HUSSEIN OVER HERE,  USED LINCOLN'S BIBLE ONLY TO RIDE THE POPULARITY OF  SPIELBERG'S BLOCKBUSTER. THE SAME REASON BACK IN '92  CLINTON HOPPED ON THE "BASIC  INSTINCT" WAGON BY SWEARING IN ON SHARON STONE'S VAGINA. [ LAUGHTER ] AN OATH HE KEPT, BY THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T GET ME WRONG THEY PUT ON A  GOOD SHOW WITH OUR MONEY. YOU'VE GOT  BEYONCE,  KELLY CLARKSON,  JAMES TAYLOR. AND I HAVE TO ADMIT, THIS SHOWS  HOW FAR WE'VE COME AS A NATION. A BLACK GUY WHO LIKES JAMES  TAYLOR? ♪ BECAUSE I'VE SEEN FIRE AND  I'VE SEEN RAIN ♪  ♪ BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A BLACK  GUY AT YOUR SHOW ♪ [ LAUGHTER ] THEN CAME THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIDE  PARADE, WITH EIGHT FLOATS FROM  OBAMA AND BIDEN'S HOME STATES HAWAII, ILLINOIS, PENNSYLVANIA,  AND DELAWARE WHICH HONORED  DELAWARE BY JUST DRIVING THROUGH THE PARADE ON ITS WAY TO  SOMEWHERE ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND OF COURSE, THIS BEING  DEMOCRATS, THERE HAD TO BE  A LIBERAL GAY, LATINO POET FROM  MAINE.
MY FACE, YOUR FACE, MILLIONS  OF FACES IN MORNING'S MIRRORS,  EACH ONE YAWNING TO LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: SORRY, I WAS YAWMING  TO LIFE. WOULD IT KILL YOU TO THROW A  RHYME IN THERE? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A POEM. IT'S NOT THAT HARD. THERE ONCE WAS A MAN NAME BARACK  WHO'S RE-ELECTION CAME AS A  SHOCK. HE RAISED THE TAXES I PAY  AND THEN TURNED MARRIAGE GAY. AND NOW HE'S COMING AFTER YOUR  GLOCK. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] POET LAUREATE, PLEASE. NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO DO A  CRITICAL DECONSTRUCTION OF  OBAMA'S PARTISAN SCREED  MASQUERADING AS AN INAUGURAL  SPEECH. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO  CRITICIZE. I WILL JUST SAY THIS, IT WAS A  CLEAR CALL FOR A RADICAL,  COLLECTIVIST AGENDA. LISTEN TO THIS LANGUAGE.
WE, THE PEOPLE, STILL BELIEVE  THAT ENDURING SECURITY AND  LASTING PEACE DO NOT REQUIRE PERPETUAL WAR. WE, THE PEOPLE, STILL BELIEVE  THAT EVERY CITIZEN DESERVES A  BASIC MEASURE OF SECURITY AND  DIGNITY. FOR WE, THE PEOPLE--  WE, THE PEOPLE-- WE-- WE--  WE--
Stephen: WE, WE, WE. ALL THE WAY HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS LITTLE PIGGY IS SICK OF IT! SOCIALIST OVERREACH IS COMING. BY FEBRUARY WE'LL ALL BE CHAINED  UP IN SOLAR-POWERED ASPARAGUS  GULAGS BEING FORCE-FED BIRTH CONTROL PILLS BY ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS WHO GAY-MARRY US TO  ENDANGERED SEA TURTLES. [ LAUGHTER ] MY ADVICE:  FIND A GOOD LOOKING TURTLE-MATE  SOON; YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP  WITH A BUTTER-BEAK. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS  WAY. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DAY ONE  FOR--  WHAT'S HIS NAME? DIP CHUTNEY? [ LAUGHTER ] HAM HOCKNEY? [ LAUGHTER ] ROM COMEDY! [ LAUGHTER ] WHATEVER. REMEMBER ALL THOSE GREAT THINGS  HE WAS GOING TO DO ON DAY ONE OF  HIS PRESIDENCY?
STARTING ON DAY ONE, I AM  GOING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES TO GET  AMERICA BACK TO WORK. ON DAY ONE, I WILL LABEL CHINA A  CURRENCY MANIPULATOR. I WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE, AND  I'LL STOP IT IN ITS TRACKS ON  DAY ONE.
Stephen: WHAT COULDA BEEN! [ LAUGHTER ] INSTEAD, ON DAY ONE HE WATCHED A  "DESIGNING WOMEN" MARATHON,  PLAYED FRUIT NINJA ON THE TOILET, AND DRANK RANCH DRESSING  STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE. [ LAUGHTER ] STILL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STILL A PRETTY GOOD DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL NATION, I WILL NOT SIT IDLY  BY WHILE OBAMA RUBS OUR NOSES IN  THE WILL OF THE ELECTORATE. SO TONIGHT, I AM RE-INAUGURATING  MYSELF AS  COMMANDER-IN-OPPOSING-THE-CHIEF  FOR AN HISTORIC SECOND TERM. BOYS, ROLL OUT THE BIBLES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪  BRIEF HISTORICAL NOTE: THESE  BIBLES ONCE BELONGED TO LINCOLN  NEBRASKA'S RED ROOF INN. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, HERE WE GO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I, THE REVEREND SIR DR. STEPHEN  T. MOS DEF COLBERT, D.F.A,  HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD, DO SOLEMNLY AFFIRM THAT I  WILL FAITHFULLY REJECT THIS  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WILL, TO THE BEST OF YOUR  KNOWLEDGE, PRESERVE, PROTECT,  AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION, AND ENSURE HE'S A ONE TWO-TERM  PRESIDENT. IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH, SO  HELP ME GOD, PLAY BALL, THE  TRIBE HAS SPOKEN,  BA BA BA BA-DA! I'M LOVIN' IT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIG
