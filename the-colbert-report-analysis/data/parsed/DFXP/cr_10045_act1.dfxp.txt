TONIGHT DID WE LIFE IRAQ TOO SOON OR DID WE NOT START OUR THIRD WAR THERE EARLY ENOUGH. THEN A NEW BREAKTHRU IN MARKETING. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT AFTER AN UNSKIPPABLE 30 SECOND  AD. AND MY GUEST DAVID FANNING IS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF PBS'S INVESTIGATIVE NEWS PROGRAM FRONTLINE, DAMMIT, I SAID I WOULDN'T PLEDGE, NOW THEY'RE COMING TO MY OFFICE. THE NEW FORD 5150 IS MADE OF 97% ALUMINUM WHICH MEANS IT'S LIGHTER BUT YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO SEE YOU BE EVERYBODY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, FOLKS YOU KNOW, FOLKS YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH THE SHOW ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU DO. BECAUSE ONE THING I HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT I LOVE WEST VIRGINIA. IT IS MY FAVORITE OF THE DIRECTIONAL VIRGINIAS. STEP IT UP, EAST AND SOUTH. THAT'S WHY, FOLKS, I WAS SO CONCERNED WHEN THE LIBERAL MEDIA MADE A BIG STINK OUT OF A MERELY LARGE STINK. JIM?
SOME 300,000 PEOPLE IN WEST VIRGINIA ARE FACING NOW A FIFTH DAY WITHOUT TAP WATER AFTER A CHEMICAL SPILL CONTAMINATED THEIR WATER SUPPLY.
THE ONLY APPROPRIATE USE IS TOILET FLUSHING. SO FLUSHING YOUR COMMODE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE BUT DON'T MAKE BABY FORMULA WITH IT, DON'T BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH IT, DON'T WASH WITH IT, DON'T SHOWER WITH IT.
A GROUP OF WEST VIRGINIANS WHO CAN'T SHOWER,  BRUSH THEIR TEETH OR FEED THEIR BABIES? A&E, YOU'VE GOT YOUR NEXT HIT. FOLKS, THE LEAKED TOXIN IS SOMETHING CALLED  4-METHYLCYCLOHEXANE METHANOL WHICH IS USED TO WASH COAL BEFORE IT GOES TO MARKET IN SOMETHING CALLED THE FROTH FLOTATION PROCESS AND CAUSES NAUSEA, VOMITING AND DIARRHEA. SO WHETHER YOU ARE A LUMP OF COAL OR A HUMAN, EXPECT SOME FROTH FLOTATION. (LAUGHTER) NOW THE CHEMICAL CAME FROM A STORAGE FACILITY RUN BY SOMETHING CALLED FREEDOM INDUSTRIES. SO WEST VIRGINIAIANS, IF YOU'VE GOT UNCONTROLLABLE VOMITING AND DIARRHEA, LET FREEDOM RAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, THE LIBERAL DON'T- POISON-THE RIVER CROWD HAS DEMONIZED THIS PATRIOTIC COMPANY BUT THEIR C.E.O. GARY SOUTHERN REASSURED LOCALS THAT ALL IS FINE IN HIS DISTINCTIVE SOUTHERN ACCENT.
WE HAVE MITIGATED THE RISK, WE BELIEVE IN TERMS OF FURTHER MATERIAL LEAVING THE FACILITY AND OUR MISSION NOW IS TO CLEAN UP, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL, THAT HITS THE SPOT. EXPLAINING WHY 300,000 PEOPLE NO LONGER HAVE A WATER SUPPLY IS THIRSTY WORK. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. 4-METHYLCYCLOHEXANE METHANOL SHOULD BE VERY POPULAR IN WEST VIRGINIA, FOR PETE'S SAKE IT'S GOT TWO METHS IN THERE. [APPLAUSE] BESIDES-- I HAVE THIS ON GOOD AUTHORITY, I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE.
THE CHEMICAL HAS A VERY, VERY LOW TOXICITY. IT HAS NO EFFECT ON AQUATIC LIFE SO THERE IS NO DANGER TO FISH IN THE RIVER.
Stephen: SEE, LOW TOXICITY, ZERO DANGER TO FISH IN THE RIVER, WHICH SHOULD BE A RELIEF TO WEST VIRGINIANS WHO HAVE NOW DEVELOPED GILLS. BESIDES, I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE SCIENCE ISN'T IN ON WHETHER HUMAN BEINGS NEED WATER TO SURVIVE. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER OPTIONS. FOR INSTANCE WHAT ABOUT SALIVA. I'M DRINKING IT RIGHT NOW. YES, IT'S A LITTLE BLAND BUT I FIND, I FIND I JUST TAKE A LITTLE COUNTRY TIME LEMONADE--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I JUST PUT A PINCH BETWEEN MY CHEEK AND GUM AND I GOT ZESTY REFRESHMENT WITHOUT BEING A SLAVE TO BIG TAP. WHAT IS THAT TASTE? IT'S GOT 4 METHTYLCYCLOHEXANE METHANOL. MMM, THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT COUNTRY. (LAUGHTER) NOW, SPEAKING OF WATERLESS MOUNTAIN REGIONS, AFGHANISTAN. (LAUGHTER) FOR THE LAST WEEK THE OBAMA REGIME HAS BEEN ROCKED BY LEAKS FROM FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES' EXPLOSIVE NEW MEMOIR, "DUTY," AVAILABLE AT AIRPORT BOOKSTORES WHERE OF COURSE THEY ARE FREE. NOW THE BOOK, THE BOOK TAKES DEAD AIM, THE BOOK TAKES DEAD AIM AT THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF THE AFGHAN WAR. ACCORDING TO HIS OWN DEFENSE SECRETARY, QUOTE, PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS SKEPTICAL, IF NOT OUTRIGHT CONVINCED THAT HIS OWN STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN WOULD FAIL.
FOLKS I GOT TO SAY IT IS SHOCKING TO HEAR THAT OBAMA HAS A STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN. SURE SEEMS LIKE HE'S FREE BALLING IT. BUT FOLKS, I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME HEADLINES RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO DEFEND THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY IN AFGHANISTAN BY SAYING IT'S NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS HIS POLICY IN IRAQ. BECAUSE WHILE OBAMA TWIDDLES HIS THUMBS IRAQ IS FALLING INTO A STATE OF CRIPPLING VIOLENCE THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A ROCK, JIM.
AL QAEDA EXTREMISTS MAKING SERIOUS GAINS IN IRAQ'S ANBAR PROVINCE WHERE HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN TROOPS WERE KILLED OR WOUNDED FIGHTING JIHADIS IN THE LAST DECADE. TWO CITIES IN PARTICULAR, FALLUJAH AND RAMADI NOW SEEING SOME OF THE WORST FIGHTING SINCE THE IRAQ WAR.
I CANNOT BELIEVE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GIVEN UP ON IRAQ CITIES WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT LIKE FALLUJAH AND-- HELP ME OUT, RAMADA, IS THAT IT? YES, I'M NOT SURPRISED. I MEAN FOAM PILLOWS THAT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANYONE STRAP ON A SUICIDE VEST. NATION, WE'VE HAD TWO WARS SINCE 9/11 AND OBAMA HAS REFUSED TO LAUNCH EITHER ONE OF THEM. LUCKILY, IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR VICTORY WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. NEVER-ENDER'S GAME FOLKS, OUR PRESIDENT IS THE JOHN MAYER OF WAR. HE NEVER COMMITS AND AFTER HE LEAVES YOU, YOU GET A VIOLENT FLARE UP IN YOUR TRIBAL REGIONS. WHICH, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQ.
HIS ABANDONMENT OF IRAQ LED DIRECTLY TO AL QAEDA TAKING OVER --
AL QAEDA NOW CONTROLS WHAT WE FOUGHT SO HARD TO FREE.
PRECIOUS BLOOD WAS SPILLED AND NATIONAL TREASURE WAS EXPENDED. HELPING IRAQIS REMOVE A BRUTAL DICTATOR. THAT PROGRESS IS NOW THREATENED.
BLACK FLAGS OF AL QAEDA ARE FLYING AND THAT'S A COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL AND YOU MAY SEE THE SAME RESULT IN AFGHANISTAN AS WE ARE SEEING IN IRAQ.
Stephen: WELL SAID, SENATOR McCAIN. IF WE LEAVE AFGHANISTAN THAT PLACE COULD SINK INTO WAR-TORN CAY OWES, RIGHT NOW IT IS MERELY BULLET RIDDLED ANARCHY. SO AL QAEDA-- KEEP THIS IN MIND, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOLKS, FOLKS, AL QAEDA WOULDN'T HAVE COME BACK IF THE PRESIDENT HADN'T ABANDONED IRAQ AFTER A MERE EIGHT YEARS. I MEAN I FOR ONE, I FOR ONE WAS SHOCKED, SHOCKED THAT OBAMA FLEW TO BAGHDAD TO SET A WITHDRAWAL DATE BACK IN 2008 AND EVEN MORE SHOCKED THAT HE DID IT WEARING A PRESIDENT BUSH MASK. I MEAN THE GUY, THE GUY IS A QUITTER. IF OBAMA--  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IF OBAMA HAD BEEN AROUND DURING THE 100 YEARS WAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 50 YEARS TOPS. WELL, I SAY IF IRAQ-- IF IRAQ IS IN CHAOS BECAUSE WE WITHDREW OUR TROOPS THEN THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS TO SEND OUR TROOPS BACK IN. RIGHT, SENATOR McCAIN?
FIRST OF ALL, NO COMBAT TROOPS, OBVIOUSLY. LET'S GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY. I WOULD SUGGEST PERHAPS SENDING DAVID PETRAEUS AND AMBASSADOR CROCKER BACK OVER THERE.
Stephen: OKAY, YEAH, DAVID PETRAEUS COULD FIX THIS THING IF YOU JUST GAVE HIM A TANK ON THE BATTLEFIELD. NOW OBAMA--  (LAUGHTER) I THINK OBAMA MUST DO THIS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS IMPORTANT OBAMA HAS TO DO THIS BECAUSE ONCE YOU'VE BEEN AT WAR IN A PLACE, YOU ARE ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT EVER HAPPENS THERE. THAT IS WHY-- AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, THAT IS WHY YOU MUST NEVER END WARS. THINK ABOUT THIS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THEY'RE NEVER, EVER WOULD HAVE BEEN A WORLD WAR II IF WE HADN'T STOPPED FIGHTING WORLD WAR I. THAT'S JUST MATH. OR ARE YOU A FAN OF HITLER, PRESIDENT WILSON? OR TAKE THAT, OR TAKE THAT PUSSY NAPOLEON, HE RETREATS FROM MOSCOW, PRETTY SOON RASPUTIN, THE COMMIES MOVE IN, KHRUSHCHEV BANGS HIS SHOE, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW PUTIN IS TOPLESS AND JOHNNY WEIR CAN'T GO TO THE OLYMPICS. AND SOON WHAT'S HAPPENING-- I SWEAR THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQ WILL HAPPEN IN AFGHANISTAN. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON TO BLAME FOR THAT, ALEXANDER THE GREAT. IN 323 HE CUTS AND RUNS AND A THOUSAND YEARS LATER ISLAM IS FOUNDED BOOM, MUSLIM EXTREMISTS. I AM GOING TO SAY IT I'M GOING TO SAY IT, MACEDONIA'S BEST YEARS ARE BEHIND IT. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THIS SORT OF THING NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN, PRESIDENT O BAMENTA NEEDS TO SEND TROOPS ANYPLACE WE DON'T WANT BAD THINGS TO HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE. THAT IS WHY--  (LAUGHTER)  I AM CALLING FOR A SURGE INTO THE UNSTABLE REGION OF EVERYWHERE. OF COURSE I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING PERMANENT. OUR TROOPS WILL LEAVE THE MOMENT WE'RE SURE NO ONE WILL EVER HURT ANYONE ELSE EVER AGAIN. AFTER THAT, WE WILL RAKE THE SEAS, IMPRISON THE WIND AND COUNT EVERY STAR. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. NOW, WILL IT BE EASY--  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NO, IT WON'T BE EASY. BUT ONCE WE'RE FIGHTING IN EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH, AT LEAST WE CAN NEVER BE DRAWN INTO ANOTHER WAR. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
