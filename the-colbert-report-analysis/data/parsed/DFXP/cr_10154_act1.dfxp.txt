Stephen: TONIGHT, OBAMA UNVEILS HIS PLAN TO FIGHT I.S.I.S. WHILE I.S.I.S. UNVEILS THEIR PLAN TO VEIL EVERYONE. (LAUGHTER) THEN ADVICE FOR A STRUGGLING RESTAURANT CHAIN. THREE WORDS -- CHEESE-FILLED FORKS. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUESTS TONIGHT, "UNLOCKING THE TRUTH," ARE A HEAVY METAL BAND MADE UP OF 12 AND 13-YEAR-OLDS. THEY AVAILABLE FOR THEIR OWN BAR MITZVAHS. (LAUGHTER) RYAN GOSLING HAS WELCOMED HIS FIRSTBORN CHILD INTO THE WORLD. WAIT -- WHAT DO YOU CALL A BABY GOSLING? (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"! ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT," EVERYONE! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! THERE IT IS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU! I JUST RIDE THE WAVE. I JUST RIDE THE WAVE. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE HEROES. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE DOING IT. YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE, AND THESE PEOPLE RIGHT THERE. I GOTTA TELL YA. FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I TELL YOU, THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE, THEY ARE THE ONES GENERATING ALL THE ENERGY AND ALL THE HEROISM! THESE ARE THE IT-GETTERS! I JUST RIDE THE WAVES OF THEIR TRUTH. NOW NATION, I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT AMERICA FACES AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT FROM THE BRUTAL TERRORISTS IN I.S.I.S., ALSO KNOWN AS "THE ISLAMIC STATE." (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, THAT IS NOT A SAFETY SCHOOL. (LAUGHTER) I.S.I.S. HAS BECOME MY OFFICIAL NUMBER-ONE ENEMY. YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR NOW, RAISINS IN SALAD. (LAUGHTER) NOW, PRESIDENT PACIFIST HERE HAS FINALLY GOTTEN OFF THE POT AND DECLARED KINDA-SORTA WAR, WHICH I KINDA-SORTA SUPPORT. (LAUGHTER) I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE ASKING, "DOESN'T HE NEED CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL TO DECLARE WAR?" TO WHICH I RESPOND, "SHUT UP, GREG." (LAUGHTER) CONGRESS ALREADY GAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA ALL THE AUTHORITY HE NEEDS BACK WHEN HE WAS A BETTER PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
IT IS THE VIEW OF THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT THE 2001 AUMF CONTINUES TO APPLY TO I.S.I.L.
Stephen: YES, THE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE" OR "AUMF"! AUMF STILL APPLIES TO I.S.I.S., EVEN THOUGH AUMF-CORDING TO THE AUMF -- (LAUGHTER) -- THE PRESIDENT IS AUTHORIZED TO USE ALL NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE FORCE AGAINST THOSE NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS OR PERSONS HE DETERMINES PLANNED, AUTHORIZED, COMMITTED OR AIDED THE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. OF COURSE, I.S.I.S. DID NOT ATTACK US IN 2001. THAT WAS AL QAEDA. BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA FIXED THAT.
I.S.I.L. IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, PURE AND SIMPLE. IT WAS FORMERLY AL QAEDA'S AFFILIATE IN IRAQ.
Stephen: OKAY. IT WAS AFFILIATED WITH AL QAEDA -- SO THEY'RE BOMBABLE NOW. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE IF CONGRESS GAVE THE PRESIDENT AUTHORIZATION TO BOMB NIRVANA IN 1994, HE COULD STILL BLOW UP THE FOO FIGHTERS TODAY. (LAUGHTER) AFTER ALL, THEY HAVE DECLARED JIHAD!  (APPLAUSE) DAVE GROHL HAS DECLARED JIHAD ON FOO! (LAUGHTER) NOW, WHILE "I" FULLY SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN OF DOING THIS WITH JUST DRONE STRIKES, SOME OPPOSE IT. FIRST OF ALL, ME. ALSO, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR AND YOUR DISAPPROVING AUNT, LINDSEY GRAHAM. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S GOING TO TAKE AN ARMY TO BEAT AN ARMY. AND THIS IDEA WE'LL NEVER HAVE ANY BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO DEFEAT THEM IN SYRIA IS FANTASY. OUR STRATEGY WILL FAIL YET AGAIN. THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISE TO THE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL GET KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! HE'S SO BRAVE UP THERE! (LAUGHTER) AND WORST OF ALL -- NO ONE WILL BE ALIVE TO BLAME IT ON OBAMA! (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE IT'S TRUE, FOLKS, WITHOUT GROUND FORCES IN SYRIA, EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING PUERTO RICO, GUAM AND AMERICAN SAMOA, ARE JUST DEAD MEN WALKING. THOSE 30,000 I.S.I.S. FIGHTERS WILL KILL ALL 300 MILLION OF US OVER COLUMBUS DAY WEEKEND. (LAUGHTER) FOR THAT MATTER, WE COULD ALL BE DEAD BY THE END OF THIS SENTENCE. OKAY. WE DODGED A BULLET THIS TIME, BUT WE COULD BE DEAD BY THE END OF THIS SENTENCE. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. NOW WE'RE JUST LIVING ON BORROWED TIME. (LAUGHTER) UNLESS I'M ALREADY DEAD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THIS SURE FEELS LIKE HEAVEN, EVERYBODY. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) FOLKS -- FOLKS -- THANK YOU. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") THANK YOU, FOLKS. I AGREE WITH YOU. WHILE I APPLAUD MY FELLOW SOUTH CACKALACKIAN'S STATESMAN-LIKE PANTS-CRAPPING, I WANT TO SAY, FOLKS, PLEASE DO NOT PANIC. HMM -- THAT REALLY DOES NOT SOUND LIKE ME. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. (LAUGHTER) NOPE. SAME AS ALWAYS. 106.2. ALL RIGHT. AND HERE'S WHY, FOLKS. HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULDN'T PANIC -- BECAUSE WE "WILL" HAVE GROUND FORCES, THANKS TO OUR CLOSEST ALLY:  ANYONE WHO WILL DO IT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS RULED OUT U.S. COMBAT TROOPS AND WILL RELY ON THE IRAQI ARMY AND THE SO-CALLED MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION.
KURDISH PESHMERGA FORCES ARE FIGHTING ON THE FRONT LINES.
THE PESHMERGA WILL BE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
Stephen: YES, THE IRAQI ARMY, THE MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION, AND SOMETHING CALLED THE KURDISH PESHMERGA. WHICH I BELIEVE IS AN AGGRESSIVE AND HIGHLY-LETHAL TYPE OF YOGURT.  (LAUGHTER) NOW NATION, YOU KNOW, YOU WATCH THE SHOW, YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUPPORT OUR TROOPS AND, APPARENTLY, THESE ARE THEM NOW. AND I WOULD BUY EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM A BEER, OR WHATEVER MUSLIMS ARE ALLOWED TO DRINK. I'M GONNA SAY, PESHMERGA? AND IF WE'RE GOING INTO SYRIA, THE KEY HERE, OF COURSE, IS THE MODERATE SYRIAN OPPOSITION, WHOM THE "NEW YORK TIMES" DESCRIBED AS "A DIVERSE GROUP RIVEN BY INFIGHTING, WITH NO SHARED LEADERSHIP." WELL THAT'S GOOD.  CAUSE IF MOVIES HAVE TAUGHT US ANYTHING, IT'S THAT A RAGTAG BAND OF UNDERDOGS CAN OVERCOME ANY ODDS. (LAUGHTER) I SAY THIS WAR IN SYRIA WILL BE JUST LIKE EXPENDABLES 3, AN EXPENSIVE SEQUEL THAT NO ONE WILL WANT TO SEE. PLUS, WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF ARAB PARTNERS. THAT NUMBER? IMAGINARY.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS SO FAR UNWILLING TO NAME THOSE ARAB PARTNERS. BUT AS ONE SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL PUT IT, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE ARAB MEMBERS HAVEN'T OFFERED TO DO AIRSTRIKES, BECAUSE SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE.
Stephen: THERE IT IS. AN ANONYMOUS OFFICIAL IS TELLING US THAT OUR UNNAMED ARAB PATTERNERS DEFINITELY MAYBE WON'T "NOT" CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING!  (LAUGHTER) AND THAT QUOTE RAISE AS LOT OF QUESTIONS. FIRST AND FOREMOST -- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THAT CNN GRAPHIC? WE SEE A GLOBE, HIGHLIGHTING THE REGION IN QUESTION, SUDDENLY A GENTLE BREEZE BLOWS A QUOTE ONTO THE DESK OF WORLD AFFAIRS THROUGH A GENTLE RAIN OF MAGICAL NEWS DUST. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S CNN -- 24-HOUR COVERAGE OF WHATEVER FLOATS BY. AND THE REPORTING -- (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE HAVE CONFIRMED THIS, THE REPORTING THERE IS DEAD-ON BECAUSE MY GRAPHICS TEAM CAN ALSO CONFIRM THAT THE "BOSTON GLOBE" NOW REPORTS THAT, WHILE TRAVELING THROUGH EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST IN ORDER TO MOBILIZE SUPPORT FOR THE OPERATION AGAINST I.S.I.S., ANONYMOUS STATE DEPARTMENT SOURCES, WHEN PUSHED FOR SPECIFICS ON THE EXTENT OF ARAB NATION INVOLVEMENT, BE IT AIR SUPPORT, GROUND SUPPORT, LOGISTICS OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, APPARENTLY, "DID NOT SAY WHICH ARAB NATIONS HAD OFFERED TO CARRY OUT AIRSTRIKES." (APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS,  -- THAT WAS LIKE 200 MAN-HOURS OF RENDERING. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS, THE ADMINISTRATION WON'T IDENTIFY OUR ARAB PARTNERS. BUT THEY SWEAR WE HAVE "TONS" OF THEM OUT THERE. AND THEY'RE WILLING TO DO ALL KINDS OF STUFF WITH US. JUST LIKE THE OTHER MEMBER OF THE COALITION, OUR HOT CANADIAN GIRLFRIEND. SHE'S REAL. SHE JUST CAN'T VISIT BECAUSE SHE'S IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW. BUT SHE'S GOING TO HELP US FIGHT I.S.I.S. I SWEAR! (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
