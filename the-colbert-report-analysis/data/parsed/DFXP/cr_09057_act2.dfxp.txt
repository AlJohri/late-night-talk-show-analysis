THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK. FOLKS, AS YOU KNOW, I AM  AMERICA'S MOST PROMINENT  CELEBRITY CATHOLIC, BUT I  BELIEVE ALL OTHER FAITHS ARE EQUALLY WRONG. [LAUGHTER] SO MY GUEST TONIGHT, LAWRENCE  WRIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT ONE  OF THOSE FAITHS: SCIENTOLOGY. NOW NORMALLY, I DON'T TRUST  OTHER RELIGIONS, BUT I STARTED  TO FEEL A CONNECTION TO SCIENTOLOGY WHEN I SAW THEY WERE  ABLE TO AFFORD AN AD IN THIS  SUNDAY'S SUPERBOWL. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, THAT'S THE RELIGIOUS  BIG-TIME. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CATHOLIC  CHURCH IS GOING TO COMPETE. THE POPE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET  SOME CLYDESDALES. [LAUGHTER] SCIENTOLOGY WAS FOUNDED IN 1954  BY SCIENCE FICTION AUTHOR AND  MILLIONAIRE-ON-GILLIGAN'S-ISLAND L. RON HUBBARD. [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT DO SCIENTOLOGISTS  BELIEVE? BASICALLY THAT WE'RE ALL  EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS CALLED  "THETANS" TRAPPED IN AN EARTH BODY, AFTER GALACTIC LEADER XENU  BROUGHT THE THETANS HERE,  STACKED THEM UP AROUND VOLCANOS, AND BLEW THEM UP WITH HYDROGEN  BOMBS. I'M SORRY, JIMMY, IS THAT  CORRECT IN MY PROMPTER? THAT IS KIND OF, WOW --  WOW, BIT OF A STRETCH. WAIT 'TIL I TELL MY PRIEST ABOUT  THIS BEFORE HE INTERCEDES WITH  GOD FOR ME WHO THEN FORGIVES MY SINS AFTER I SAY A PRAYER  WHATEVER NUMBER OF TIMES THE  PRIEST TOLD ME TO. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] UNFORTUNATELY, THE CHURCH HAS  HAD SOME RECENT PUBLIC RELATIONS  PROBLEMS. FOR INSTANCE, IT SEEMS  SCIENTOLOGY PRESIDENT DAVID  MISCAVIGE BELIEVES IN TOUGH  LOVE, WITHOUT SO MUCH OF THE LOVE PART. [LAUGHTER] JIM?
MARTY WRATHBUN, WHO USED TO  WORK DIRECTLY UNDER DAVID  MISCAVIGE, SAYS THERE'S BEEN A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE WITHIN THE  LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCH, THE  CULTURE ENCOURAGED BY MISCAVIGE  HIMSELF.
MISCAVIGE IS PORTRAYED AS A  RUTHLESS AND CRUEL LEADER, AT  TIMES USING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO GET HIS WAY AND PUNISH  SUBORDINATES.
HE TREATS HIS SUBORDINATES IN  ALL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT  LIKE SLAVES IN A SLAVE CAMP AND LITERALLY BEATS THEM DOWN.
DAVID MISCAVIGE WAS THE ONE  LEADING THIS WHOLE PHYSICAL  VIOLENCE KICK, AND IT WAS HIM WHO WAS BEATING PEOPLE UP.
Stephen: WE ASKED DAVID  MISCAVIGE FOR A COMMENT, AND HE  SENT THIS RESPONSE: A WATERMELON WITH A KNIFE IN IT, WITH A NOTE  THAT SAYS "YOU". [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKFULLY, IT DOESN'T SAY "ME"  OR I'D BE TERRIFIED. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, IF ANY SCIENTOLOGY  LAWYERS ARE WATCHING, THIS IS  WHAT HE ACTUALLY SENT ME, FOR  REAL. I MEAN THAT AS MUCH AS ANYTHING  I'VE SAID ON THIS SHOW. [LAUGHTER] AND NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD  THINK OTHERWISE. [LAUGHTER] I AWAIT YOUR SUIT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IF THE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE,  WHY WOULD ANYBODY PUT UP WITH  IT? IT COULD BE BECAUSE WHEN HIGHER  MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH JOIN THE  ELITE GROUP CALLED "SEA ORG" THEY'RE ASKED TO SIGN A BILLION  YEAR CONTRACT. [LAUGHTER] AFTER THAT, I BELIEVE IT GOES  MONTH-TO-MONTH. [LAUGHTER] EITHER WAY, IT'S STILL MORE  FLEXIBLE THAN AT&T. [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT IS SCIENTOLOGY-- A  RESPECTABLE MODERN RELIGION LIKE  MORMONISM? OR A WEIRD CREEPY CULT LIKE  MORMONISM TWO YEARS AGO? [LAUGHTER] JOINING ME AFTER THE BREAK TO  DISCUSS MANY OF THESE  ALLEGATIONS WILL BE MAN WHO UNCOVERED MANY OF THEM IN HIS  NEW BOOK "GOING CLEAR" LAWRENCE  WRIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
