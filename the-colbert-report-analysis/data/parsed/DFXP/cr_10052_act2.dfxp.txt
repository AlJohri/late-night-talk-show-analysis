Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS SHOW FROM DAY ONE OF BROADCAST, THIS SHOW HAS ALWAYS BEEN ALL ABOUT AMERICA. BUT I HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED THAT I HAVE A GLOBAL REACH AROUND. EVIDENTLY THERE IS A NEW TV SHOW IN CHINA INSPIRED BY ME. AND BY INSPIRED BY I MEAN INFLAGRANT VIOLATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. JIM? LET'S SHOCK THE CONSCIENCE OF A NATION. [COLBERT REPORT THEME PLAYS]
Stephen: I'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY THE CHINESE! (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF WHOLESALE THEFT. AND I LOVE IT. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE ONLY THE BIGGEST HITS GET CHINESE BOOTLEGGED.

AND THEY HAVE LOVINGLY PLAGIARIZED EVERYTHING ABOUT MY SHOW FROM MY ROCKIN MUSIC TO MY AWESOME IRONMAN LANDING TO MY HAVING A POINT OF VIEW. (LAUGHTER) WHICH FRANKLY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT. OF COURSE, THERE ARE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES, INSTEAD OF MY EAGLE OF TRUTH, THE BANQUET HAS A HELICOPTER BECAUSE EAGLES ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO FLAP IN CHINESE AIR. (LAUGHTER) AND THE SHOW, I GOT TO SAY, THE SHOW DOES AN ADMIRABLE JOB OF CAPTURING MY CRONKITE-IAN NEWS DIGNITY. [LAUGHS] EGGS! IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO. [LAUGHTER] NATION, NATION, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS? THE BANQUET'S NETWORK, NINGXIA TV, REACHES MORE THAN 400 MILLION VIEWERS. AS THEY SAY ON THE BANQUET, THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS GIVE ME A [BOING SFX] [LAUGHTER] THE REPORT, THE COLBERT REPORT NOW HAS A SERIOUS TOEHOLD IN CHINA AND I'M PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING TO APPEAL TO THE LARGEST MARKET ON EARTH.
