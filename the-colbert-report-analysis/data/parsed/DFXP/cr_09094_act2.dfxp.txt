Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, YOU KNOW, THEY SAY YOU  ARE WHAT YOU EAT. SO I GUESS THAT MAKES ME  CONSTANTLY. THIS IS THOUGHT FOR FOOD. FOLKS, I HAVE LONG GUARDED THE  BORDER OF THE AMERICAN MOUTH  SCAPE, A.K.A., THE FREEDOM HOLE. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN SALSA OUTSOLD  THE CLASSIC AMERICAN CONDIMENT  KETCHUP, I TRIED TO RING THE SALSA ALARM BUT I MISSED AND HIT  THE TACO BELL. AND THEY JUST GAVE ME MORE  SALSA. WELL, FOLKS, THIS INVASION OF  THE BODY SNACKERS JUST GOT  WORSE.
WITH MORE AMERICANS TRYING TO  EAT HEALTHY, HUMMUS IS GETTING  MORE AND MORE POPULAR.
YEAH, HUMMUS HAS LONG BEEN A  STAPLE OF MIDDLE EASTERN  CUISINE. DEMAND FOR IT IS REALLY RISING  AS AMERICANS SEEK MORE HEALTHY  SNACKS AND SPREADS. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAYS THE  FOOD SEGMENT WHICH INCLUDES  HUMMUS TOTAL $530 MILLION AT U.S. FOOD RETAILERS LAST YEAR.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. HUMMUS! THE DELICIOUS MIDDLE EASTERN  APPETIZER. I'VE WARNED YOU ABOUT CREEPING  SHARIA, NATION. NOW WE HAVE SPREADABLE SHARIA. AND IT'S MADE WITH CHICK PEAS,  THE LEGUME OF DOOM. KNOWN BY MANY NAMES: SANAGALU,  CHANA, THE BENGAL GRAM OR DOWN  MEXICO WAY, GARBANZO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT'S COME UP OVER OUR POROUS  SOUTHERN BORDER IN LEAGUE WITH AL PITA TO STEAL AMERICAN SNACK  JOBS ONCE HELD BY ONION DIP AND  YOUR FINGER. NOT ON MY WATCH BEINGS FOLKS. STAY VIGILANT. NEXT UP, FOLKS, I DON'T WANT TO  BRAG. BUT I HAVE FRIENDS. AND NOT JUST MY COMMUTING BUDDY  CAR POOL CARL. HE SAVES ME A TON ON TOLLS AND  ALWAYS LETS ME PICK THE TUNES. BUT MAKING NEW FRIENDS IS TOUGH. FOR ONE THING, I'M TOTALLY  UNINTERESTED IN WHAT ANYBODY  ELSE HAS TO SAY. AND I MEET SO FEW PEOPLE WHO  SHARE THAT INTEREST. FORTUNATELY, THERE'S A GREAT NEW  WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS. AND LIKE ALL THE BEST WAYS, IT  INVOLVES ALCOHOL.
WHEN TWO PEOPLE CLICKED THEIR  CUPS THEY BECAME FRIENDS. EACH PERSON THAT ENTERED A BUDDY  VENT WOULD CONNECT THEIR  FACEBOOK PROFILE WITH THE CUPS  CHIP. SO THEY JUST DID THE SAME AS  ALWAYS. WENT OUT DRINKING BUD AND MAKING  NEW FRIENDS. BUDDY CUPS. THE MORE BUDS, MORE FRIENDS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THE BUDDY CUP OR AS IT WILL SOON  BE KNOWN AT BARS EVERYWHERE, THE  STALKER STEIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOW, I'VE ALWAYS SUSPECTED... I'VE ALWAYS SUSPECTED THAT THE  ANSWER TO MY LONELINESS WAS AT  THE BOTTOM OF A BEER GLASS. TURNS OUT I WAS RIGHT. THESE CUPS ARE WONDERFUL, FOLKS. JUST PICTURE THIS. IT'S 2:00 a.m  YOU'RE 12 PINTS DEEP PROPPING  YOURSELF UP ON A POOL CUE  SCREAMING ALONG WITH SOME STRANGER TO CHUMBAWUMBA. AND YOU'RE JUST ONE CUP CLINK  AWAY FROM A LIFETIME  RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN WHOSE FACE YOU ARE OTHERWISE TOO DRUNK  TO RECALL. YOU KNOW, FRIENDSHIP. SO, BRAVO! BUDWEISER FOR PUSHING THE  ENVELOPE IN BEER DELIVERY  SYSTEMS. IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU RESPONDED TO  COORS' INGENIUS CAN THAT  HARNESSES ADVANCED THERMO DYNAMICS TO ALERT YOU WHEN YOUR  BEER IS COLD. BEFORE THAT, YOU HAD TO RELY ON  THERMAL CONTACT NODES OR IN  LAYMAN'S TERMS, YOUR FINGERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE  TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THAT  UPHOLD THE PROUD AMERICAN TRADITION OF PUTTING FAR MORE  EFFORT INTO THE CONTAINER THAN  THE BEER IT HOLDS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
