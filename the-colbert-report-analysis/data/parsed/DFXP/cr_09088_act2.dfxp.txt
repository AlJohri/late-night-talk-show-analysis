Stephen:  WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, I'M SURE YOU AGREE WITH  ME THAT IT IS A PROUD DAY TO BE  AN AMERICAN BECAUSE THANKS TO A MINORITY OF U.S. SENATE, WE NO  LONGER HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR OF  SOME MANIAC COMING AFTER THOSE WE LOVE WITH A GUN CONTROL BILL. ( LAUGHTER )  JIM.
ON WEDNESDAY, THE SENATE  BLOCKED THE MOST FAR-REACHING  GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION IN TWO  DECADES.
IT NEEDED 60 VOTES. IT GOT 54.
THE GUN CONTROL PACKAGE IS  STOPPED COLD IN THE SENATE.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT! WE DIDN'T DO IT! WHOOO!   ( CHEERS )   JIMMY, JIMMY, WHERE'S MY BALLOON  DROP? AND, FOLKS, WE ACHIEVED THIS  VICTORY, DESPITE RELENTLESS  PRESSURE FROM SPECIAL INTEREST GRIEVING PARENTS BEING USED AS  PROPS BY GENERALISSIMO  GLOCK-SNATCH OVER HERE WHO, FOLLOWING THE DEFEAT, TOOK TO  THE ROSE GARDEN.
THOSE WHO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT  PREVENTING MORE AND MORE GUN  VIOLENCE WILL HAVE TO BE AS PASSIONATE AND AS ORGANIZED AND  AS VOCAL AS THOSE WHO BLOCKED  THESE COMMONSENSE STEPS TO HELP KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE. AND I SEE THIS AS JUST ROUND  ONE.
Stephen:  JUST ROUND ONE? SO WE HAVE TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF  OUR AMMO MAGAZINES BUT YOU GET  AS MANY ROUND AS YOU WANT? ( LAUGHTER )  LUCKILY, 45 BRAVE SENATORS STOOD  TALL TO PROTECT WHAT THEY  HOMELAND MOST PRECIOUS THEIR "A" RATING FROM THE N.R.A., LIKE  REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND BRYLCREEM  STORAGE FACILITY TED CRUZ WHO FOUGHT THIS BACKGROUND CHECK  BILL BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT WOULD  PUTTOUS AN INEVITABLE PATH TO A NATIONAL GUN REGISTRY, EVEN  THOUGH IT'S NOT PROPOSED IN THE  BILL. RIGHT?
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY PROPOSED,  BUT IF THE BILL THAT IS BEING  CONSIDERED WERE ADOPTED, IT WOULD PUT US ON THAT PATH.
Stephen:  YES, JUST BECAUSE  THE BILL DOESN'T PROPOSE A GUN  REGISTRY, DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T EVENTUALLY HAPPEN. REMEMBER, THERE'S ALSO NOTHING  IN THE RULE BOOK THAT SAYS A  GOLDEN RETRIEVER CAN'T PLAY  BASKETBALL. ( LAUGHTER ). ALTHOUGH, UNDER CURRENT LAW, IT  CAN BUY A GUN. ( LAUGHTER ). AND THE HEROES-- FOLKS, THE  HEROES WERE NOT JUST  REPUBLICANS. FOUR BRAVE DEMOCRATS JOINED IN. INCLUDING ALASKA SENATOR MARK  BEGICH. WHO CELEBRATED HIS VOTE TO KILL  BACKGROUND CHECKS SAYING, "IT'S  DANGEROUS TO DO ANY TYPE OF POLICY IN AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT."  YES, TRUE LEADERSHIP IS WAITING  UNTIL THE MOMENT HAS PASSED. ( LAUGHTER ). THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED  THAT WE SHOULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL  1950 TO DECLARE WAR ON JAPAN. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU KNOW, WHEN THINGS HAVE  COOLED OFF, BUT NO, OLD SPEED  RACER OVER HERE JUST COULD NOT WAIT TO TAKE AWAY HIROHITO'S  GUNS. NEVER AGAIN. AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO SALUTE  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER WAYNE  LAPIERRE. HE DELIVERED A HUGE VICTORY FOR  A MISUNDERSTOOD MINORITY, THE 8%  OF AMERICANS WHO ARE AGAINST UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. NOW, SOME SAY ANYONE WHO WOULD  OPPOSE KEEPING DWUNS OUT OF THE  HANDED OF MURDERERS AND THE MENTALLY ILL ARE OUTSIDE OF THE  MAINSTREAM, PERHAPS EVEN  PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNSOUND THEMSELVES, BUT WE'LL NEVER  KNOW. BECAUSE THANKS TO 45 SENATORS,  THERE WILL BE NO BACKGROUND  CHECKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
