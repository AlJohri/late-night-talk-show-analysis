(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS-- THAT IS HOW YOU END UP WITH A SHARK IN ADDITIONO. DR. KEITH WHAT YOU HAVE GOT.
I'M GOOD WITH MR. .
Stephen: MR. KEITH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BOOK HERE CALLED A CASE FOR CLIMATE ENGINEERING. HOW WILL WE SAVE THE PLANET. BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE, ALL THE CHICKEN LITTLES OUT THERE ARE SAYING THE PLANET IS WARMING UP. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT DOW.
I TOTALLY BELIEVE IT. IT IS WARMING UP AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT ALONG WITHER O PEOPLE WAYS TO STOP IT.
Stephen: OKAY, DOES INVOLVE ME USING ONE OF THOSE LITTLE PIG TAILLIGHT BULBS?
THAT IS A USEFUL THING TO DO. AND I HAVE THOSE IN MY HOUSE. AND I'M THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD WHAT IS THE OTHER THING BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: SO WHAT DO WE DO?
THE OTHER THING IS HORRIFYING. YOU COULD ACTUALLY SPRAY SULFURIC ACID IN THE ATMOSPHERE 20 KILOMETERS OVER OUR HEAD AND USE THAT TO STOP THE PLANET WARMING UP.
Stephen: YOU CAN SPRAY SOMETHING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO CHANGE-- OKAY.
SPRAY POLLUTION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO STOP IT WARMING.
Stephen: SO IN THE END POLLUTION SAVES THEM ALL. WE OWE POLLUTION, WE OWE ACID RAIN AN APOLOGY IS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING.
IT WOULD BE A TOTALLY IMPERFECT TECHNICAL FIX T WOULD HAVE RISKS T WOULDN'T GET US OUT OF THE LONG RUN NEED TO STOP POLLUTING BUT IT MIGHT ACTUALLY SAVE PEOPLE AND BE USEFUL.
Stephen: OKAY, AGAIN, I INTERRUPTED YOU SLIGHTLY THERE. HOW DOES IT WORK, YOU HOW MANY PLANES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE, HOW DO YOU DO THIS.
LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO STOP IT WARMING IN 2020. YOU START WITH A FLEET OF JUST 2 OR 3 KIND OF MODIFIED BUSINESS JETS.
Stephen: LIKE A G-6.
THAT'S IT.
Stephen: LIKE A G6.
AND YOU PUT SAY 20,000 TONS OF SULFURIC ACID NOT STRATOSPHERE EVERY YEAR AND EACH YEAR YOU HAVE TO PUT A LITTLE MORE AND IN THE LONG RUN THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT CUTTING EMISSIONS. WE WILL NEED TO REIGN IT.
Stephen: NO, WE'LL GET TO IT EVENTUALLY. IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE SHROUDING THE EARTH IN SULFURIC ACID.
SO PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE SKAERED THAT IT WILL PREVENT US CUTTING EMISSIONS.
Stephen: RIGHT, AND ALSO THAT IT IS SULFURIC ACID.
IT IS.
Stephen: IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY THIS COULD COME BACK TO BITE US IN THE ASS? PLAN CONNECT THE EARTH INN SULFURIC ACID BECAUSE I'M ALL FOR IT. THIS IS THE ALL CHOCOLATE DINNER. I STILL GET TO HAVE THE CO2 AND I JUST HAVE TO SPRAY SULFURIC ACID, RIGHT. ALL OVER THE EARTH.
RIGHT QUESTION BUT WE PUT 50 MILLION TONS OF SULFURIC ACID. THERE ARE A MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR WORLDWIDE, IT KILLS.
Stephen: THAT'S TERRIBLE.
BUT IT WILL BE BETTER IF WE PUT MORE IN.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 1% OF THAT. A TINY FRACTION OF THAT.
WE SHOULD REDUCE IT.
ONLY 1% MORE WE'RE JUST KILLING 10,000 MORE PEOPLE.
Stephen: YOU CAN DO MATH, OKAY.
BUT THAT'S-- SO KILLING PEOPLE IS NOT THE OBJECTIVE HERE.
Stephen: KILLING PEOPLE IS NOT THE OBJECTIVE. I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR.
ACTUALLY, SLOWING CLIMATE CHANGE, ACTUALLY STOPPING CLIMATE CHANGE IN A WAY THAT COULD HELP PEOPLE THIS GENERATION, PEOPLE LIVING NOW, IN A WAY THERE'S NO OTHER EASY ALTERNATIVE.
Stephen: CAN YOU JUST DO IT FOR PART OF THE PLANET.
PRETTY OF THE WHOLE PLANET.
Stephen: COULD YOU, JUST SAY LIKE MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR THE UNITED STATES?
VERY HARD TO DO. IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS-- BUT THE BIG FEAR IS THAT ONE COUNTRY WILL WANT IT ONE WAY AND ONE THE OTHER, LIKE TWO FRAT BOYS ARGUE OVER THE THERMOSTAT AND IN MANY WAYS THE BIGGEST FEAR HERE, WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ACTUALLY AGREE ABOUT HOW TO CONTROL THE PLANET'S THERMOSTAT.
Stephen: LET'S SAY THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA SAY YEAH, LET'S DO IT BUT RUSSIA AND INDIA SAY YEAH, NOT DO IT.
THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF I WAKE UP SWEATING ABOUT.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
Stephen: IT'S YOUR GODDAMN IDEA.
IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT TO BE AN OLD IDEA.
A SIGN OF THE COMMUNITY MOSTLY DECIDED NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT FOR FEAR PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THE THREAT OF CUTTING EMISSIONS.
WHAT WHAT HAPPEN TO ITS SULFURIC ACID AFTER IT IS SPRAYED. DOES IT JUST STAY UP THERE.
NO, IT RAINS DOWN BUT AS I SAID, IT RAINS DOWN. IT'S A TINY EDITION OF WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING.
HAVE YOU GOTTEN SOME GRIEF FOR SUGGESTIONING THIS?
SURE THIS IS LIKE WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THE CASE FOR LEPROSY.
Stephen: DOW HAVE ONE.
YEAH, IT'S A GREAT WEIGHT LOSS PLAN. BUT ALSO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAPPY THAT PEOPLE ARE FINALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHILE IT IS UGLY T DOES APPEAR THAT IT REALLY COULD DO SOME GOOD.
Stephen: COULD AN INDIVIDUAL START THIS?
IN PRACTICE ONLY A COUNTRY.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT A MAN IN LIKE A HOLLOWED OUT VOLCANO WITH HENCHMEN WHO OCCASIONALLY SHAKE THEIR FIST AT THE SKY AND SAYS THEY SAID I WAS A FOOL AT HARVARD. WHO'S THE FOOL NOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S A NATURAL WORRY BUT I THINK IN THE END, NO. THIS WOULD BE DONE BY MAJOR COUNTRIES BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW COUNTRIES AGREE ABOUT WHERE TO SET THE THERMOSTAT. WHO DECIDES. AND MY BIGGEST REASON FOR WRITING THE BOCK AND FOR TALKING ABOUT IT IS MY VIEW THAT WE WON'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS IN IGNORANCE.
Stephen: WE HAVE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION NOW SO WHEN IT BECOMES OUR LAST HOPE, PEOPLE CAN SAY HEY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, REMEMBER. WE SAID WE GET TO DO IT.
ED WORST WAY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS WOULD BE IF WE ALL AGREE THAT WE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT IN POLITE SOCIETY, SUPPRESS IT WHICH IS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. AND THEN IN 2030 SUDDENLY THE CRISIS WE MAKE FAST DECISIONS.
Stephen: MAYBE IT'S HAPPENING ALREADY. DOW EVER LOOK AT THOSE PLANES UP THERE, THEY HAVE CONTRAILS BEHIND THEM. MAYBE ALL THOSE PLANES WITH THE CRON TRAILS ARE SPRAYING CHEMICAL APPROXIMATES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE RIGHT NOW AND UNCLE SAM SAM ISN'T TELLING US.
SEEMS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY.
Stephen: THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES ISN'T TELLING SOMETHING TO ITS CITIZENS SEEMS EXTREMLY UNLIKELY. I THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE YOUR IDEA ALREADY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. DAVID KEITH, A CASE FOR CLIMATE ENGINEERING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
