Stephen: TONIGHT TWO COLLEGE GRADUATES HAVE TOO MUCH DEBT OR ARE PHILOSOPHER JOBS NOT PAYING WHAT THEY USED TO? THEN IS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BIASED AGAINST WOMEN? WE ALREADY INVENTED LAST BLAST MASCARA, WHAT MORE DO THEY WANT? AND MY GUEST SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN IS THE LEFT'S LATEST DARLING. SORRY GLUTEN ALLERGIES, YOUR 15 MINUTES ARE UP. A MAN IN TENNESSEE WAS ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTING TO HAVE SEX WITH AN ATM. EVEN WORSE HE HAD TO PAY A PENALTY FOR EARLY WITHDRAWAL. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT      Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, COME ON! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY, GOOD TO YOU HAVE WITH US ON THIS FINE SPRING MONDAY NIGHT. WE GOTTA GO. NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, FOLKS IT'S NOT JUST MINDLESS ADORATION, FOLKS. I NEED IT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SINGLING ME OUT FOR YOUR APPLAUSE. IT MAKES ME FEEL SPECIAL AS AN INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE FRANKLY I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT EQUALITY. EQUALITY RIGHTS FOR GAYS, EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN. EQUAL SPACE FOR EQUAL. AND NOW OBAMA'S EQUALICRATS OVER AT NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH ARE DIRECTING SCIENTISTS TO PERFORM THEIR EXPERIMENTS ON BOTH FEMALE AND MALE ANIMALS. COED LAB RATS? THAT'S A BAD IDEA. YOU KNOW LATE AT NIGHT THEY'RE GONNA HOOKUP AT WORK AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE AWKWARD AROUND THE WATER BOTTLE THE NEXT DAY. YOU SEE TRADITIONALLY WHEN SCIENTISTS TEST A DRUG ON MICE OR RATS THEY ARE USUALLY MALE. SEEMS NATURAL ENOUGH, THE FEMALE RATS ARE ALL BEING USED TO TEST COSMETICS. BUT-- LOOKING GOOD, ALL RIGHT. BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ANOTHER REASON THE FEMALE RATS WERE LEFT OUT OF THE EXPERIMENTS.
TURNS OUT FEMALE RATS ALSO HAVE THOSE PESKY HORMONES SO TO CONTROL FOR THAT VARIABLE, MOST RESEARCHERS STUDY JUST MALES. YOU GOT TO LEAVE THE FEMALES OUT. ANY SCIENTIST KNOWS IT IS CRUCIAL TO ELIMINATE EXTRANEOUS VARIABLES LIKE HALF THE GLOBAL POPULATION. BUT APPARENTLY, APPARENTLY, FOLKS, TURNS OUT THAT OMISSION CREATED A FEW OOPSY DAISIES LIKE AMBIEN DOSAGE.  AMBIEN WAS PUT ON THE MARKET AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING 20 YEARS AGO BUT LAST YEAR THE FDA TOLD WOMEN TO CUT THEIR DOSES IN HALF BECAUSE NEW STUDIES SHOW THEY  METABOLIZE THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT MORE SLOWLY THAN MEN DO. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THOSE WOMEN DIDN'T HEART THE FDA  BECAUSE THEY WERE ASLEEP FOR SOME REASON. AND NOW THEY'RE BLAMING THE RATS.
NOT STUDYING BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ANIMALS RESULTS IN MORE PROBLEMS FOR WOMEN DOWN THE ROAD.
IF THE WHOLE DARN PIPELINE IS MALE DOMINATED AND SEX DIFFERENCES TRULY DO MATTER HOW CAN IT NOT BE THE CASE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO END UP WITH ON AVERAGE A LOT MORE NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN SO, WOMEN SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR BONUS SIDE EFFECTS. I MEAN THIS TIME IT'S BEING SLEEPY BUT NEXT TIME IT MIGHT BE INVISIBILITY OR HEAT VISION. AND THIS LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF TESTING ON ONLY MALE SUBJECTS IS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION THAT FEMALES ARE SIMPLY A VARIATION ON A THEME. FOLKS THAT'S SCIENCE. MALE IS DEFAULT HUMAN. ALL RIGHT IF YOU WANT BELLS AND LISTENS LIKE THE BUMPY BITS IN FRONT OR ALL THAT FANCY PLUMBING DOWN THERE, IT COMES AT A PRICE, LADIES. FOR INSTANCE WE DON'T MAKE MEDICINE FOR YOU. I MEAN AFTER ALL HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO, WOMEN ARE TOO COMPLICATED THAT IS WHY THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED ON BOATS. THEIR GYNO PIECES MAKE COMPASS GOES CRAZY. DON'T BELIEVE ME, THEN WHY ARE THEIR INSIDES EXACTLY LIKE THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE? LOST A LOT OF GOOD MEN IN THERE. AND FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE) AND FOLKS--  (APPLAUSE)
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I JUST SHOWED ADMIRABLE RESTRAINT. BUT FOLKS WHETHER YOU ARE AN AMERICAN OR A LADY AMERICAN, THINGS ARE GOING GREAT IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. THE DOW IS OVER 16,000. AND THAT IS A LOT OF DOWS. I MEAN TO PUT THAT IN LAYMEN'S TERMS, IF YOU TOOK 16,000 DOWS AND LAID THEM END-TO-END THAT WILL BE ALMOST 5 NASDAQS AND I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TO ASK SOMEONE ELSE.
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE 2008 WHEN THE ECONOMY CRATERED THANKS TO OBAMA'S MISGUIDED RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I THINK, I WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE LAST SEASON OF  ACCORDING TO JIM. IT WAS A DARK TIME FOR EVERYONE. AND FOLKS THIS RECOVERY IS ALL THANKS TO OUR HEROIC BANKS WHO, FACED WITH POSSIBLE EXTINCTION, HUNKERED DOWN AND GOT TO WORK ACCEPTING ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD THAT WE GAVE THEM. AND ALL THEY ASKED IN RETURN IS THAT WE NOT ASK ANYTHING IN RETURN OR EVER BRING THE SUBJECT UP AGAIN. BUT SOME WANTED TO DESTROY OUR BANKS LIKE MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR AND SCHOOL LIBRARIAN YOU HAD A CRUSH ON ELIZABETH WARREN. (APPLAUSE) SHE IS CREDITED WITH THE CREATION OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND ARGUED  FOR IT ON THE WORLD'S MOST RESPECTED FINANCIAL PROGRAM.
I WANT A STRONG CONSUMER AGENCY.
WHAT WOULD THEY DO.
WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS MAKE SURE WE COULD ALL READ OUR CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT.
CAN'T YOU READ YOUR CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT?
NOT THE ONES WE HAVE NOW, THEY ARE ABOUT 30 PAGES LONG, TINY LITTLE PRINT.
YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF CONTRACT LAW AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU CAN'T READ THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S DESIGNED NOT TO BE READ.
GOOD BECAUSE I CAN'T READ MY CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT. IT'S AGAINST MY CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT. I THINK, I'M TOO SCARED TO READ IT AND WARREN'S NOT JUST ATTACKING CREDIT CARDS NOW, SENATOR BUZZSHACKLE HERE WANTS TO TAKE THE ADVENTURE OUT OF BANKING.
BANKING SHOULD NOT BE THIS KIND OF HIGH RISK ACTIVITY. AND IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKING ON RISK. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THOSE RISKS YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. BANKING SHOULD BE BORING.
BANKING SHOULD NOT BE BORING. OPENING A SIMPLE CHECKING ACCOUNT SHOULD BE A HIGH RISK ADRENALINE FUELED BALLS TO THE WALL EXTREME SPORT THAT IS WHY MY ACCOUNTANT BILL FILES MY TAXES WHILE LANDING IN AN INVERTED 360 NOSEBONE BUTTERSLIDE. AND IT'S NOT MAKING HER ANY FRIENDS, FOLKS.
ELIZABETH WARREN IS LOATHED BY WALL STREET, HATED BY WALL STREET.
WALL STREET HATES HER.
THEY REALLY, REALLY DO HATE HER.
JUST LIKE THE OLD WALL STREET ADAGE, IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY, IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN. AND NOW SHE'S INTRODUCED THE BANK ON STUDENT EMERGENCY LOAN REFINANCING ACT. A BILL SO SOCIALIST THAT SOCIALIST SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS PRAISED IT SAYING THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THIS BILL IS THAT ELIZABETH THOUGHT OF IT AND I DIDN'T. SHE'S OUT-COMMIE-ING THE COMMIE. HANG ON, JIMMY, PUT WARREN'S HAIR ON SANDERS, OKAY. NOW PUT SANDERS HAIR ON WARREN. OH MY GOD, NOW SWITCH THEIR FACES IT'S THE SAME PERSON. NOW WORST OF ALL, FOLKS WARREN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LINING UP TO MAKE HER PRESIDENT AND SHE IS DOING NOTHING DISSUADE THEM.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
OH, METHINKS SHE DOTH CLEARLY STATE SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TOO MUCH. I MEAN WHY ELSE WOULD SHE RELEASE THIS MEMOIR A FIGHTING CHANCE. THE ONLY REASON POLITICIANS WRITE THESE THINGS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE THROWING THEIR HAT IN THE RING. THAT'S WHY I'M CONFIDENT THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO NOMINATE GOVERNOR FIFTY SHADES. HE PROMISES TO TIGHTEN WASHINGTON'S BELT BUT I WON'T TELL YOU WHERE. THE POINT IS-- BIG REPUBLICAN AND OR BONDAGE FANS HERE TONIGHT. THE POINT IS--  PUMPKINPATCH. THAT'S MY SAFE WORD. THE POINT IS IRRESPONSIBLE MEDIA NEEDS TO STOP GIVING SENATOR WARREN A PLATFORM TO SPEW HER DESTRUCTIVE AGENDA. WHY? I DON'T KNOW.
I WILL ASK TONIGHT'S GUEST SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
