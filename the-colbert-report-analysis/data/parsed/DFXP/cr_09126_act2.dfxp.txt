Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW  YOU KNOW THAT I AM NO MAN OF  ASTRO-PHYSICS. IF GOD WANTED US TO KNOW HOW THE  UNIVERSE WAS CREATED HE'D HAVE  TOLD US ABOUT IT IN A BOOK WHICH HE DID. CHECK AND MATE. YOUR MOVE, ATHEISTS. STILL, I AM A FAN OF FREQUENT  GUESTS OF THE SHOW  ASTRO-PHYSICIST NEIL DEGRASSE  TYSON. HE ANSWERS ALL MY QUESTIONS  ABOUT SPACE LIKE WHAT'S INSIDE A  SUPER NOVA? AND ISN'T IT CREEPY THAT LUKE  AND LEIA KISSED? BUT, FOLKS, I HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE  WITH SOMETHING MY FRIEND NEIL  SAID IN A VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH BUSINESS INSIDER ABOUT WHY WE  HAVEN'T BEEN CONTACTED BY  ALIENS.
I WONDER IF IN FACT WE HAVE  BEEN OBSERVED BY ALIENS AND UPON  CLOSE EXAMINATION OF HUMAN CONDUCT AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR, THEY  HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS NO  SIGN OF INTELLIGENT LIFE ON  EARTH.
Stephen: OH, REALLY? THERE'S NO INTELLIGENT LIFE ON  EARTH? WELL, MAYBE THE ALIENS AREN'T  INTERESTED IN US FOR OUR MINDS,  NEIL. MAYBE THEY LIKE US FOR OUR  BODIES. MAY I REMIND YOU THEY'RE NOT  STICKING THE PROBES IN THE  NOODLE, OKAY. THEY'RE STICKING THEM IN THE  KABOODLE. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED  ASS-TRONAUTS, NOT  BRAINSTRONAUTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW, SADLY FOR SCIENCE, NEIL  WASN'T DONE TALKING.
IT FORCES US TO THINK OF  OURSELVES AS INTELLIGENT. WE HAVE A CERTAIN INTELLIGENCE  GAP BETWEEN US AND OTHER  CREATURES ON EARTH. YOU DON'T WALK BY THE WORM ON  THE STREET AND SAY, GEE, I  WONDER WHAT HE'S THINKING. NO, YOU STEP ON THE WORM. THIS IS WHAT WE DO. AS HUMANS.
Stephen: YOU HEAR THAT,  FOLKS? NEIL DEGRASSE-TYSON NOTED  ASTRO-PHYSICIST IS A  WORM-STOMPING MONSTER. HE DOESN'T GO FISHING FOR SPORT. HE DOES IT TO TORTURE THE BAIT. AND WHAT IF ALIENS DID VISIT US  BUT THEY LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE  WORMED AND THEY LANDED HERE RIGHT AFTER A SUMMER RAINSTORM  AND ON THEIR WAY TO ADDRESS THE  U.N., THEY SAW YOU AND SAID, OH, LOOK THERE'S ASTRO PHYSICIST  NEIL DEGRASSE-TYSON LET US MAKE  A GESTURE OF PEACE BY SPELLING OUT THE PERIODIC SYMBOL FOR  HYDROGEN ON THE SIDEWALK. HEY, HE'S COMING TOWARD US  CLEARLY TO LEARN THE SECRETS OF  THE UNIV DIANA AHHHHH. AND THEY GET CRUSHED UNDER YOUR  HEEL DE GRASS TYSON. BESIDES, NEIL, WHY ARE YOU SO  DOWN ON WORMS? RECENTLY CAME ACROSS A VERY  CHARMING WORM WHO JUST MIGHT  CHANGE YOUR MIND, OKAY? THIS IS BEATRICE. OKAY. I MET HER A FEW WEEKS AGO IN MY  KITCHEN. SINCE THEN WE'VE HAD SOME  WONDERFUL CONVERSATIONS. SHE'S A GREAT LISTENER. IN FACT, I WOULD SAY SHE'S MY  CLOSEST FRIEND. I LOVE YOU, BEATRICE WORM.
STEPHEN? tephen: WHAT IS IT, JIMMY? I'M DOING THE SHOW.
THAT'S NOT A THAT'S A PIECE  OF LINGUINI. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: OF COURSE IT'S A  WORM, JIMMY. I FOUND HER IN A BOWL OF  SPAGHETTI. IT'S THEIR NATURAL CAMOUFLAGE. BESIDES, WHAT KIND OF NAME IS  BEATRICE FOR A PIECE OF  LINGUINI? HE'S JUST JEALOUS. ANYWAY, ALIENS, WE ARE SMART. COME TALK TO US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
