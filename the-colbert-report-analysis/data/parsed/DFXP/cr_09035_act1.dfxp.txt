(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. COME ON.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. FOLKS, FOLKS-- AS A GREAT  LADY ONCE SAID WE GOT TO  HANG OUT. WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS,  EVERYBODY. AS WITH YOU SEE I HAVE FULLY  INCRINGE ELED MY SET FOR THE  WEEK. I HAVE CANDY CANE COLUMNS  BACK THERE. I HAVE MY TWO BIG BALLS  RIGHT DOWN HERE. I HAVE POINSETTIAS ALL BACK  THERE, FESTIVE AND DEADLY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT LET'S NOT FORGET IT IS  ALSO NIGHT THREE OF HANUKKAH  WHICH I AM CELEBRATING BY HAVING JUST MENTIONED IT  RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE WELCOME, JEWS. OKAY, THAT'S CALLED THE  COLBERT BUMP. SPEAKING OF ME, EVERYONE'S  SPEAKING OF ME.
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR  JIM DEMINT IS STEPPING DOWN,  SO GUESS WHO'S STEPPING UP AS A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE,  STEPHEN COLBERT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WITHIN HOURS AFTER THE  ANNOUNCEMENT HE SET UP A  COLBERT FOR SENATE WEB SITE AND ESTABLISHED A TWITTER  ACCOUNT,@COLBERT FOR SE.
I WANT TO PUT PIE VOTE IN  FOR STEPHEN RIGHT NOW. SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM SERIOUS  CONSIDERATION. GOD KNOWS THE U.S. SENATE  COULD USE STEPHEN COLBERT.
THERE IS ALREADY A  TWITTER PAGE, A DRAFT  COLBERT WEB SITE. I CAN TELL YOU HAVING DONE A  SHOW WITH HIM IN CHARLESTON,  HE IS AN ABSOLUTE ROCK STAR IN THAT STATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES, I AM A ROCK  STAR IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND  NOT JUST BECAUSE I ENDED MY RALLY THERE WITH HERMAN CAIN  BY BITING THE HEAD OFF A  DOVE. IT'S A LOCAL DELICACY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: LOVELY WITH A  SIDE OF PALMS. THEY LOVE ME IN THE PALMETTO  STATE BECAUSE I LOVE IT. I LOVE THE BEACHES. I LOVE THE MOUNTAINS. I LOVE THE BEAUTIFUL OLD  ESTATES THAT HAVE NO  NEGATIVE HISTORICAL  CONNOTATION WHATSOEVER. OF COURSE NOT EVERYBODY IS  HAPPY ABOUT MY IMMINENT  APPOINTMENT. FOR INSTANCE THE ATLANTIC  CALLED MY VASTLY  OVERQUALIFIED. AND NBC.COM SAID SENATOR  STEPHEN COLBERT, PERHAPS NOT  AS CRAZY AS SENATOR JIM  DEMINT. WHAT? I AM AT LEAST AS CRAZY AS  JIM DEMINT. HE WANTED TO BAN GAY  TEACHERS FROM THE CLASSROOM. I WANT TO BAN TEACHERS FROM  THE CLASSROOM. (LAUGHTER)  WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE AGENDA. I SAY LET THE FREE MARKET  DECIDE WHAT THE ATOMIC  WEIGHT OF CARBON IS. BUT MI THE CLEAR, MI THE  CLEAR FIRST CHOICE HERE,  FOLKS. FIRST OF ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE  AT PUBLIC POLICY POLLING,  PUBLICLY POLICY POLLED SOUTH CARLINIANS TODAY AND FOUND  THAT OF THE POSSIBLE  REPLACEMENTS, I TOP SOUTH  CAROLINA VOTER'S WISH LIST WITH 20% SUPPORTING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH. 20%, THAT'S A HALF. NOW MY NETWORK CONTRACT  PROHIBITS ME FROM TAKING ON  ANOTHER FULL-TIME JOB, SO  THE SENATE WOULD BE PERFECT. (LAUGHTER)  BUT WE MUST, OF COURSE,  HONOR THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS  HERE, WHEREIN ONE PERSON PICKS WHOEVER THEY WANT. NOW THE LAST THING I WANT TO  DO IS PUT ANY PRESSURE ON  GOVERNOR HALEY, OR TRY TO INFLUENCE HER DECISION, NOT  THAT THAT WOULD WORK. SHE HAS THE WISDOM OF  SALOMON, THE COURAGE OF  LINCOLN, AND THE BALLS OF  MARGARET THATCHER. (LAUGHTER)  OKAY. BUT HOTTER, REALLY HOTTER. I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THIS  SENATE APPOINTMENT TO TURN  INTO ANOTHER BLAGOJEVICH SCANDAL WHERE, AND I'M JUST  SPIT BALLING HERE, AN  AMBITIOUS WOULD-BE SENATOR  WITH A SECRET STASH OF NEARLY A MILLION COMPLETELY  UNTRACEABLE FORMER SUPER PAC  DOLLARS USES THAT MONEY TO BUY POLITICAL INFLUENCE BY  TRANSFERRING ALL OF IT TO A  SHADOWY FUND LOCATED IF THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF SOUTH  CAROLINA THAT NO ONE WOULD  BE ABLE TO TRACE. (LAUGHTER)  THAT WOULD BE HORRIBLE IF  THAT CAME OUT. WHICH IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE  LIKE I SAID, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE  TO TRACE. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE I CAN'T BE HELD  RESPONSIBLE IF OTHER PEOPLE  TRY TO INFLUENCE HER LIKE THE NEARLY 12,000 OF YOU WHO  LOBBIED FOR MY APPOINTMENT  BY TWEETING@NIKKI HALEY WHICH THEN FORCED THE GOFF  THEY ARE TO RESPOND ON HER  FACEBOOK PAGE WRITING  STEPHEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SOUTH CAR LINE'  U.S. SENATE SEAT AND THE  THOUSANDS OF TWEETS YOU AND YOUR FANS SENT ME BUT YOU  FORGET ONE THING, MY FRIEND,  YOU DIDN'T KNOW OUR STATE DRIJ, BIG, BIG MISTAKE. NOW SHE'S REFERRING HERE TO  HER APPEARANCE ON MY SHOW  BACK IN APRIL. I COULDN'T NAME SOUTH  CAROLINA STATE DRINK WHICH  IS MILK, THEY MUST HAVE  CHANGED IT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A CHILD IT WAS A BIG  GULP FULL OF GRAIN ALCOHOL  AND HI-C. (LAUGHTER)  NOW THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA IS  SAYING NIKKI HALEY HAS SHUT  THE DOOR ON MY SENATE BID. THAT IS RIDICULOUS. BECAUSE IF GETTING A SOUTH  CAR LINIA TRIVIA FACT WRONG  DISQUALIFIES YOU FOR OFFICE THEN NIKKI HALEY WOULD HAVE  STEP DOWN AFTER SAYING THIS.
WHAT'S THE STATE  AMPHIBIAN.
HMM.
Stephen: OH, HOW DOES IT  FEEL WHEN THE SPIKE SHOE IS  ON THE OTHER FOOT? IT'S THE SPOTTED SALAMANDER. OH. YOU KNOW THE STATE DISH,  GOVERNOR? IT'S REVENGE. BEST SERVED COLD WITH A SIDE  OF SALAMANDER MILK. (LAUGHTER)  SO NATION, DO TO THE GIVE UP  THE FIGHT. KEEP TWEETING GOVERNOR HALEY  WHY I WOULD MAKE AN IDEAL  SENATOR USING THE HASHTAG SPOTTED SALAMANDER. (LAUGHTER)  OR, OR GOVERNOR, GOVERNOR  YOU CAN END THIS BY COMING  ON MY SHOW-AND-TELLING ME YOUR DECISION IN PERSON. OR WE COULD MEET SOMEWHERE  MORE CONVENIENT, LIKE MY  SENATE CHAMBERS. BECAUSE I WILL REMEMBER WHO  MY FRIENDS ARE. NOW FOLKS, SINCE THE BRUTAL  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THERE  HAS BEEN A LOT OF  SOUL-SEARCHING GOING ON AT FOX NEWS. AN I AM CONFIDENT THAT THEY  VENT ALLLY WILL FIND ONE. NOW-- EVENTUALLY WILL FIND  ONE. NOW WHILE MANY PEOPLE HAVE  CALLED FOX NEWS AN ORGAN OF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY T WAS NOT FOX NEWS'S FAULT THAT  REPUBLICANS LOST. IT WAS THIS GUY. IT WAS-- SHOOT, WHAT'S HIS  NAME. I KNOW DON'T HELP ME, DONE  HELP ME. MOP SQUEEGEE. (LAUGHTER)  FOX NEWS CHAIRMAN AND GOBLIN  KING ROGER AILES WANTED  SOMEBODY ELSE AS "THE WASHINGTON POST" RECENTLY  REPORTED IN THE SPRING OF  2011 AILES ASKED A FOX NEWS ANALYST HEADED TO  AFGHANISTAN TO PASS ON HIS  THOUGHTS TO GENERAL DAVID  PETRAEUS, RESIGN FROM THE MILITARY AND RUN FOR  PRESIDENT. AND AILES WASN'T JUST  ENCOURAGING PETRAEUS TO RUN,  HE PUT A SERIOUS OFFER ON  THE TABLE. WHICH WAS SECRETLY TAPED I  ASSUME, BY PAULA BROADWELL  HIDING UNDER THE TABLE. (LAUGHTER)  LISTEN PETRAEUS RESPOND TO  AILES OFFER.
TELL HIM IF I EVER RAN,  BUT I WON'T, BUT IF I EVER  RAN I WOULD TAKE HIM UP ON HIS OFFER.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
HE WOULD QUIT FOX.
ALL RIGHT.
AND BANKROLL IT OR MAYBE  I'M CONFUSED AND THAT WAS  RUPERT.
I THINK ONE IS BANKROLLING  IT.
BIG BOSS IS BANKROLLING  IT. ROGG CERTIFICATE GOING TO  RUN AND THE REST OF RUSS  GOING TO BE HERE IN-HOUSE.
Stephen: OKAY SO, IF  PETRAEUS RAN FOR PRESIDENT  MURDOCH WOULD PAY FOR IT, AILES WOULD MANAGE IT, AND  FOX NEWS WOULD SELL IT  THOUGH THEIR AUDIENCE. NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, A  NEWS NETWORK CHOOSING THE  CANDIDATE SOUNDS LIKE A  CONFLICT OF INTEREST. SO DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY  ABOUT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AILES SAID HE DID IT BECAUSE  THE REPUBLICAN FIELD NEEDED  TO BE SHAKEN UP. SO IT WAS REALLY JUST  WORRIED ABOUT CASTING HIS  REALITY SHOW. AS A TV PRODUCER AILES WAS  TRYING TO AVOID A REPEAT OF  2008 WHEN REPUBLICANS  NOMINATED THIS CRANKY OLD GUY WHO-- HOW TO MAKE A  STAR. LIKE WATCHING A MATLOCK  MARATHON ABOUT WHO KILLED  THE ECONOMY. THEY COULDN'T SAVE THE JOHN  McCAIN SHOW EVEN BY MAKING  HIS RUNNING MATE HONEY BOO  BOO. (LAUGHTER)  NOW UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK  THAT'S WHO THAT IS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HONEY BOO BOO, A  DOLLAH MAKES ME HOLDA. NOW UNFORTUNATELY, PETRAEUS  TURNED DOWN ROGER AILES, I  ASSUME, TO SPEND MORE TIME NOT MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH  HIS FAMILY. BUT FOLKS, THAT DOES NOT  MEAN AILES SHOULDN'T TRY  THIS AGAIN IN 2016 OR THAT  OTHER NETWORKS SHOULD. I MEAN MSNBC HAS ALREADY  PICKED THEIR GUY. I SAY--   (LAUGHTER)  I SAY IT IS TIME, LET'S JUST  GIVE A & E A SHOT. THEY CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE  FOLKS ON HOARDERS. NOTHING GIVES A CANDIDATE  HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE QUITE  LIKE SAVING EVERY NEWSPAPER SINCE 1932. AND YOU WANT A CANDIDATE  WITH MILITARY EXPERIENCE? THE FOOD NETWORK CAN  NOMINATE A RED VELVET  CUPCAKE. AFTER ALL, IT'S BEEN TO WAR. NOW AILES HAS SINCE SAID  THAT THE WHOLE OFFER WAS  REALLY MORE OF A JOKE. BUT YOU KNOW IT MAKES ME  THINK, WHY CAN'T A COMEDY  NETWORK PUT UP A CANDIDATE  FOR PRESIDENT? OR--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OR AT THE VERY  LEAST GET HIM APPOINTED TO  THE U.S. SENATE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
