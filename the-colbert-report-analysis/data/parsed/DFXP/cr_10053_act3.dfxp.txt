WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT USES STATISTICS TO PREDICT SPORTS OUTCOMES, A FANCY WAY OF SAYING HE'S A BOOKIE. PLEASE WELCOME NATE SILVER. WHOOO!
NATE, THANKS SO MUCH, HAVE A SEAT, MY MAN. ALL RIGHT. NATE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. WHAT AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANKS FOR COMING BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU RAN THE 538 BLOG AT THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
FOR SURE.
THAT WAS THE-- THAT WAS THE POLITICAL BLOG TO GO TO TO FIGURE OUT WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. START OUT WITH SPORTS STATISTICS, TO POLITICS, TO YOU BACK TO SPORTS. WHY 538 WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO ESPN. IS THAT HOW MANY THERE ARE NOW, 538.
WHY GO INTO SPORTS.
WELL, WE LOVE SPORTS, A GREAT WAY TO TEACH PEOPLE ABOUT MATH AND STATISTICS BUT MOSTLY IT'S A LOT OF FUN AND WE'RE SPORTS FANS. PUT IT LIKE THIS, THERE IS A LOT OF COVERAGE YOU SEE IN POLITICS THAT'S REALLY JUST GOSSIP, ABOUT A SERIOUS SUBJECT. AND WE WANT TO TAKE A FUN SUBJECT AND BE OVERLY SERIOUS ABOUT WITH IT AT TIMES.
BUT CAN YOU BE, CAN YOU BE TOO SERIOUS ABOUT FOOTBALL IN AMERICA? BECAUSE I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS IF WE WEREN'T HOLDING THE GAME THIS WEEKEND? WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT WHICH ANIMAL WAS GOING TO BE USED TO SELL WHICH BEER?
IT'S LIKE REALITY TV FOR MEN, BASICALLY. BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG CULTURAL THING. AND I DON'T KNOW, I LIKE FOOTBALL.
YOU GOT VERY GOOD AT THAT, YOU KNOW, PREDICTING WHO WOULD BE WINNING IN BASEBALL BASED ON THE STATISTICS. CAN YOU DO THE SAME THING WITH FOOTBALL. CAN YOU APPLY THE SAME STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME THIS YEAR IS THAT BOTH TEAMS ARE REALLY GOOD. IN FACT, THIS IS --
WHAT ARE THE ODDS.
WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS.
SO THE 8th TIME ACCORDING TO MY COLLEAGUE, NEIL PAYNE OF 538, THE 8th TIME WERE THE TWO BEST TEAMS HAVE ACTUALLY MET IN THE SUPER BOWL. USUALLY SOMEBODY GETS UP SET ALONG THE WAY. IT MAKES MY JOB REALLY TOUGH. IN POLITICS I'M TRYING TO POINT TO THE OBVIOUS THING AND YOU LOOKED REALLY SMART FOR-- THIS GAME IS-- I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO PLACE MONEY ON IT AT ALL FRANKLY.
YOU MEAN HAVE YOU PERCENTAGE, WHO IS GOING TO WIN.
SO THE NUMBERS SAY IT'S GOING TO BE A TIE REALLY, SO NO ONE WINS.
A YEAR AGO I PREDICTED SEATTLE WIN SUPER BOWL. I'M GOING TO STICK WITH THAT AND SAY I WAS PRESSURED A YEAR EARLIER.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE.
YOU WOULD THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE.
YEAH.
NO, YOU WOULD BECAUSE I DON'T ACTUALLY-- I DON'T-- OKAY. SO YOU KNOW, WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO TO FOOTBALL WHAT YOU DID TO POLITICS WHICH IS TO RUIN IT WITH ACCURACY?
IF YOU GET AS GOOD WITH FOOTBALL THEN YOU ARE WHAT POLITICS AND IT WON'T BE LIKE ON ANY GIVEN SUNDAY A TEAM COULD WIN. WILL YOU JUST READ 538 AND SAY IT'S GOING TO BE SEATTLE, LET'S GO TO BED.
I THINK THE WORLD ACTUALLY IS PRETTY UNPREDICTABLE PLACE. INCLUDING IN SPORTS. I MEAN YOU KNOW.
BUT YOU NAILED 2008 AND 2012.
I THINK PEOPLE ESPECIALLY MAYBE IN THE MEDIA AREN'T VERY GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S PREDICTABLE AND WHAT ISN'T. POLITICS, WE HAVE LIKE LITERALLY LIKE HUNDREDS OF HOLES, THE BATTLE WITH THE HEAD AND ALL THOSE THINGS WAS KIND OF POINTING OUT THE OBVIOUS.
ONE THING YOU GOT UP ON 538 ALREADY ABOUT THE GAME IS YOU HAVE GOT WEATHER STATS UP THERE.
YEAH.
A 21% CHANCE THAT IT WILL BE 25 DEGREES OR BELOW, A 31% CHANCE IT WILL BE WIND OF 15 MILES PER HOUR OR MORE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, RIGHT?
SO WE WERE USING THEIR DATA AND IF YOU WANT TO GET TECHNICAL HERE.
Stephen: I THINK THAT'S ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO HERE.
SO UP UNTIL ABOUT 10 DAYS.
YEAH.
UP UNTIL 10 DAYS BEFORE THE EVENT, THEN THESE LONG-TERM AVERAGES DO AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE.
RIGHTMENT THEY MIGHT DO 15 DAY FORECAST LIKE THE FT S1 MILLION SUNSCREEN DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU ANY EXTRA ADDED ADVANTAGE BUT NOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE MODELS THAT LOOK AT THE ACTUAL WEATHER SYSTEMS, CLOUDS AND SO FORTH. AND ARE MUCH MORE ACCURATE NOW THAT WE ARE --
OF THE BIG GAME.
SO YOU SAID THAT NOT ONLY IS THIS GOING TO BE A CLOSE GAME, BUT THIS COULD BE SORT OF A BUSH VERSUS GORE GAME.
THIS IS A 2000 SUPER BOWL, I THINK POTENTIALLY.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT ONE TEAM WILL SCORE MORE POINTS BUT THE SUPREME COURT WILL GIVE THE TROPHY TO THE OTHER TEAM?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT MIGHT BE A REFEREE CONTROVERSY, PERHAPS.
WITHOUT DO YOU LIKE HAVE THE BEST COMMERCIAL THIS WEEKEND?
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WATCH THE COMMERCIAL. I ACTUALLY WATCH IT FOR THE GAME.
WELL, NATE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
OKAY.
Stephen: NATE SILVER, ESPN, 538 BLOG. CHECK IT OUT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
