(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD HAVE YOU WITH US,  LADYING AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK  YOU, PLEASE, NATION, SIT  DOWN! THANK YOU SO MUCH! FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH  US. FOLKS, I GOT, IT'S NOT  ALWAYS THIS WAY BUT TONIGHT  THAT CHANTING WAS AS CRISP  AS AN OCTOBER MORNING. (LAUGHTER)  NATION, I'M BACK FROM MY  VACATION. HI A GREAT TIME. I SPENT IT SCREAMING  OBSCENITIES AT PARK RANGERS. (LAUGHTER)  AND OF COURSE THE BIG STORY  WHILE I WAS GONE IS THE END  OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW CONGRESS CAN GET BACK TO  THE IMPORTANT WORK OF  GOVERNMENT GRIDLOCK. (LAUGHTER)  THE SHUTDOWN COST THE  ECONOMY $24 BILLION AND  CAUSED CHINA TO LOWER OUR CREDIT RATING TO A MINUS, OR  AS CHINESE PARENTS CALL IT  AN F. (LAUGHTER)  THIS WHOLE CRISIS, THIS  WHOLE CRISIS WAS SO DRAMATIC  IT LEAD SOME TO ASK IS THE UNITED STATES A FAILED  STATE? THAT IS A HEADLINE FROM  ZIMBABWE. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S LIKE TED CRUZ ASKING  HAVE YOU REALLY THOUGHT YOUR  STRATEGY THROUGH. (LAUGHTER)  SPEAKING OF WHICH, MR. TED  CRUZ KNOWS WHICH SIDE WON.
WE SAW THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES TAKE A  COURAGEOUS STAND, LISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT  EVERY ONE IN WASHINGTON JUST  WEEKS EARLIER SAID WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. THAT WAS A REMARKABLE  VICTORY.
Stephen: YES, THIS  SHUTDOWNS WITH A REMARKABLE  VICTORY. AND AS WITH ALL VICTORIES,  WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO  BLAME. WELL, FOX NEWS RESIDENT  PSYCHIATRIST AND FRAUDIAN  PHALLIC SYMBOL DR. KIM ABLOW  KNOWS EXACTLY WHO CAUSED THIS VICTORIOUS TRAIN WRECK,  JIM?
IN THE WORDS HOSTAGE  TAKING BEING HELD FOR RANSOM,  HE SAID THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE THREATENING TO BLOW THE  WHOLE THING UP. THERE'S A REAL VICTIM  MENTALITY HERE. AND IT REALLY EXPLAINS THE  PRESIDENT'S WHOLE MENTALITY  AND MANY OF HIS POLICIES. I THINK THE PRESIDENT GOING  BACK TO WHEN HIS DAD  ABANDONED HIM, WHEN HIS  MOTHER LEFT HIM WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS, THAT ALL OF  THOSE THINGS LEAD HIM TO  FEEL VICTIMIZED, HURT AND  INJURED. HE AND HE HAS EXTENDED IT TO  THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: YES, OBAMA'S  REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE WITH  CONGRESS WAS JUST HIM  GETTING BACK AT HIS PARENTS. I MEAN WE'VE SEEN THIS SAD  STORY TOO MANY TIMES. AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES  WITHOUT ROLE MODELS GO ON TO  BECOME PRESIDENT AND GIVE  EVERYONE HEALTH CARE. (APPLAUSE)  I BELIEVE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  TAKE THAT. A BRILLIANT LONG DISTANCE  DIAGNOSIS BY DR. ABLOW. BUT ONE MUST ASK HOW WAS HE  ABLE TO YANK SUCH AN  INSIGHTFUL DIAGNOSIS SO  SMOOTHLY FROM HIS ASS? (LAUGHTER)  I FOR ONE HAVE NEVER MET  KEITH ABLOW BUT AS AN  HONORARY DOCTOR OF FINE ARTS I'M WILLING TO STAKE MY  PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION THAT  HE IS STUCK IN AN ANAL  RETENTATIVE STAGE CAUSED BY HIS PARENT'S SHAMING HIM  DURING POTTY TIME. SO IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT  HE CONTINUES TO WEAR A  DIAPER AND AS WE SPEAK IS  USING HIS OWN EXCREMENT TO WRITE OUT HIS IDEAS FOR  TOMORROW'S SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE POINT IS-- I THINK THE  MESSAGE IS CLEAR, THE POINT  IS VICTORY, LET'S JUST STOP TALKING ABOUT IT. NOW NATION, IF YOU WATCH  THIS SHOW YOU KNOW MY  JUDGEMENTS ARE FINAL. SO IF YOU HAVE A RECEIPT, I  CAN OFFER STORE CREDIT. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG  OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S  NO SECRET, I'M NO FAN OF GAY  MARRIAGE. WHENEVER I'M INVITED TO A  GAY WEDDING I EXPRESS MY  OUTRAGE BY GETTING A GIFT  THAT IS NOT ON THE REGISTRY. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, MARK AND JEFFREY,  YOU'LL NEVER MATCH MY  SAUTERNE GLASSES WITH THE STEMWARE ON YOUR LIST AND  ENJOY PLAN I COUPLE'S DINNER  PARTY WITH 7 OF THEM. THAT'S WHY I AM THRILLED  THAT ONE STATE OUT THERE HAS  STRUCK A BLOW AGAINST GAY  MARRIAGE.
IT IS WEDDING DAY FOR  HUNDREDS OF SAME-SEX COUPLES  IN NEW JERSEYMENT GAY MARRIAGE NOW LEGAL IN THAT  STATE. SAME-SEX COUPLES BEGAN  EXCHANGING VOWS AT MIDNIGHT  ACROSS NEW JERSEY.
I NOW BY THE POWER VESTED  IN ME, THANK GOD, BY THE  STATE OF NEW JERSEY, IT'S ABOUT TIME, I DECLARE JOSEPH  AND ORVILLE TO BE LAWFUL  SPOUSES IN THE STATE OF NEW  JERSEY!
Stephen: YES, THAT WAS  NEWARK--   (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YES, I DON'T  KNOW WHY I'M CLAPPING. NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS. YES, THAT WAS NEWARK'S HERO  MAYOR AND SENATOR LECH COREY  BOOKER ACTING ALSO AS  JUSTICE OF THE PIECE. HE THEN WENT ON TO CATER THE  WEDDING DINNER, DRIVE THE  LIMO AND SAVE THE COUPLE FROM AN ESCAPE CIRCUS LINE. FOLKS, GAY MARRIAGE HAS COME  TO NEW JERSEY. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT  MISSED ITS EXIT ON THE  EXPRESSWAY. (LAUGHTER)  SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY  HAT TO THE OLIVE GARDEN  STATE. IF THERE'S  ANYTHING-- ANYTHING THAT  WILL TAKE THE GLAMOR OUT OF  GAY MARRIAGE IT'S NEW  JERSEY. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN I KNOW SUBURBS SOUND  NICE AT FIRST, GAY, YOU  STOPPED RENTING A CRAMPED GAY APARTMENT IN THE BIG GAY  CITY AND OWN YOUR OWN GAY  HOUSE, LOTS MORE ROOM TO GAY  LIVE. (LAUGHTER)  SOMEPLACES WITH A GAY YARD  WHERE YOU CAN PLANT SOME GAY  TOMATOES, GAY PROPERTY TAXES TEND TO BE HIGH BUT THAT IS  TO PAY FOR ALL THE GREAT GAY  SCHOOLS BUT THEN AFTER A FEW YEARS YOU GET GAY FAT, OH,  SURE, YOU PROMISE YOURSELF  YOU WILL GAY GO INTO THE  CITY BUT IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT AND YOU GAY WORKED ALL WEEK  AND GAY DATELINE NBC IS ON  AND YOU SAY OH, THE  GAY-- YOU WILL SIT ON THE COUCH WITH A GAY BEER. TRADITIONAL VALUES WIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  RIGHT NOW, NEXT UP, FOLKS,  IT'S NO SECRET MARK'S FALLEN  BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIES IN  EDUCATION. AND NOT JUST IN READING,  WRITING AND ARITHMETIC BUT  ALSO RIENE AND RECENT REPORT BY HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL  FOUND STUDENTS IN LATVIA,  CHILE AND BRAZIL ARE  IMPROVING ON STANDARDIZED TESTS THREE TIMES FASTER  THAN AMERICAN STUDENT, THREE  TIMES FASTER, THAT'S ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH. (LAUGHTER)  NOW AMERICA IS ADDRESSING  THIS PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING  CALLED THE COMMON CORE STATE  STANDARDS. WHICH "THE NEW YORK TIMES"  CALLED AN AMBITIOUS SET OF  GOALS FOR THE MATH, READING AND WRITING WILL SKILLS THAT  CHILDREN SHOULD ACQUIRE AS  THEY MOVE THROUGH SCHOOL. I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF RAISING  STANDARDS. IF WE CAN HELP EVEN ONE KID  DO BETTER IN SCHOOL, WE WILL  HELP ALL THE KIDS WHO COPY OFF THAT KID. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FOLKS THERE'S ONE  PROBLEM WITH ENCOURAGING OUR  CHILDREN TO GROW TO THEIR FULL POTENTIALMENT SOMEONE'S  GOT TO GRADE ALL THOSE  PAPERS. WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING A  TIP OF THE HAT TO  ROBO-TEACHERS. YOU SEE-- TECH COMPANIES  HAVE DEVELOPED AN AUTOMATED  READER WHICH CAN GRADE  16,000 ESSAYS IN 20 SECONDS. FINALLY, WE HAVE THE COMPUTE  APPROXIMATING POWER TO GRADE  HOMEWORK AT THE SAME  BLINDING SPEED IT WAS PLAGIARIZED FROM WIKIPEDIA. AND I AM GIVING A SPECIAL  ADDITIONAL RARE TIP OF MY  HAT TO HOW THESE ESSAYS ARE COMEPUGRADED BY EVALUATING  CRITICAL ELEMENTS BY HOW  LONG THE AVERAGE WORD IS,  HOW MANY WORDS ARE IN THE AVERAGE SENTENCE AND HOW  LONG IS THE ESSAY. BECAUSE AS SHAKESPEARE  HIMSELF WROTE BREVITY IS THE  SOUL OF WIT BUT SPLEN  DIFFICULT RUSS LOQUACIOUSNESS IS PARAMOUNT TO ACING YOUR  LIT FINAL. FINALLY--   (APPLAUSE)  FINALLY, FOLKS, I LOVE MY  AMAZON KINDLE T IS A  FANTASTIC PLACE TO STORE ALL THE BOOKS I'LL NEVER READ. AND WITH KINDLE DIRECT  PUBLISHING WRITERS CAN NOW  PUBLISH AND SELL FAN FICTION  THAT WOULD NEVER MAKE IT IN THE TRADITIONAL PRINT  INDUSTRY SUCH AS, AND THESE  ARE REAL, THE JANE AUSTEN  INSPIRED PRIDE AND  PENETRATION. OR THE HISTORICAL FICTION  ABRAHAM LINCOLN NINJA [BLEEP] MASTER, DANIEL-DAY  LEWIS, RETURN MY CALL. (APPLAUSE)  SO A BIG TIP OF THE HAT TO  AMAZON FOR PUTTING THE POWER  OF THE PRESS IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN  THEIR FINEST NEW GENRE AND  AGAIN THIS IS REAL, DINOSAUR  EROTICA. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S FOR ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN  TO THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL  HISTORY AND SAID TO THEMSELVES, I'D TAP THAT. (LAUGHTER)  THE GENRE--   (APPLAUSE)  THE GENRE INCLUDES SUCH  ACTUAL WORKS AS TAKEN BY THE  T-REX. RAFISHED BY THE TRICERATOPS  AND IN THE VELOCIRAPTOR'S  NEST, HERE IS AN EXCERPT. AZOG FELT THE KISS OF SHARP  CLAWS AGAINST HER SKIN AS  THE HIDE SLID FROM HER  SHOULDER AND EXPOSED ONE NAKED HEAVING BREAST. AZOG GASPED AND RELAXED AS  HER BODY WARMED TO THE  INTOXICATING SENSATION OF  THE BEAST FLESH AGAINST HER  OWN. THAT IS THE HOTTEST STORY OF  A PREHISTORIC CREATURE  TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A YOUNG WOMAN SINCE HUGH HEFNER. (APPLAUSE)  WHO AMONG US--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHO, WHO AMONG US HAS NOT  THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING IT ON WITH A LADY TRICERATOPS. I MEAN WE'RE ALL A LITTLE  TRI-CURIOUS. I MEAN WHEN YOU SEE A SKULL  THRILL LIKE THAT YOU DON'T  HAVE TO BE A PALEONTOLOGIST TO UNEARTH A BONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
