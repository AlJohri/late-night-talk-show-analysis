( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AUTHOR  WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED  "PRESENT SHOCK: WHEN EVERYTHING HAPPENS NOW."  GREAT. I ALREADY MISSED EVERYTHING. PLEASE WELCOME DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HI, DOUG, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK SECOND  TIME.
GOOD TO BE HERE. Stephen: SIR, YOU ARE A MEDIA  THEORIST FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO  MAY NOT KNOW, YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF 12 BOOKS INCLUDING PROGRAM OR  BE PROGRAMMED. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED PRESENT  SHOCK, WHEN EVERYTHING HAPPENS  NOW. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT TIME,  BUT HOW DOES EVERYTHING,  EVERYTHING HAPPEN NOW? DOESN'T SOMETHING HAPPEN THEN  AND OTHER THINGS HAPPEN LATER  BECAUSE I CONTINUE TO AGE.
YOU DO. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IS  EVERYTHING HAPPENING NOW.
IN PRESENT SHOCK... S THIS MYSTICAL? NOT REALLY. IN SOME WAYS MAYBE. DIGITAL NOTHING HAS A LOT TO DO  WITH IT. WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE INTERNET  WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET TO WORK  IN OUR OWN TIME IN OUR UNDERWEAR, WE THOUGHT WE WOULD  HAVE MORE TIME NOT LESS. WHEN THE INTERNET BECAME THE  DOT-COM BOOM HUMAN TIME BECAME  THE NEW COMMODITY. WE STRAP OUR DEVICES TO  OURSELVES, WE HAVE THEM VIBRATE  EVERY TIME SOMEBODY TWEETS US OR SENDS US A MESSAGE. WE END UP LIVING IN THIS  PERPETUAL STATE OF INTERRUPT  TIFF EMERGENCIES THAT USED TO BE ENDURED BY ONLY 911 OPERATORS OR  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS.
Stephen: I'M LOVING THIS. END IT OUT. tephen: I WANT TO TWEET THIS  TO MY FRIEND LOU DOBBS. ALL RIGHT. CAN YOU GIVE ME ONE OF THESE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THAT DIDN'T TAKE US OUT OF  THE MOMENT.
Stephen: WHAT? THAT DIDN'T TAKE US OUT OF  THE MOMENT, NOW DID IT.
Stephen: I'M NO LONGER  FOLLOWING WHAT YOU SAID. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE LIKE A  LUDDITE, A GUY WHO DOESN'T LIKE  TECHNOLOGY. YOU HAVE TO USE THE TECH. DON'T LET THE TECH USE YOU, MY  FRIEND.
THERE YOU GO. I MEAN, IF WE COULD HAVE OUR  TECHNOLOGIES CONFORM TO OUR  LIVES RATHER THAN CONTINUALLY TRYING TO OPTIMIZE HUMAN BEINGS  TO OUR TECHNOLOGY WE'D BE IN A  LOT BETTER SHAPE.
Stephen: WHAT'S BETTER THAN  THIS? THIS IS THE NOW-NOW. THE NOW-NOW IS TECHNOLOGY. AND IF YOU'RE NOT USING THE  TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOT  IN THE NOW-NOW, YOU'RE IN THE  THEN.
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY IS IN  THE THEN. YOU AND I ARE IN THE NOW-NOW. THE TWEETING, FACEBOOK JUST  HAPPENED. THE BIG DATA ENGINE IS LOOKING  AT WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THEY'RE NOT REALLY HERE WITH US  IN HUMAN TIME.
Stephen: WHAT IF THIS THING  WERE TALKING LIKE WHATEVER WE  CALL THIS RIGHT NOW, WHAT IF ALL OF THAT IN HUMAN HISTORY WAS  JUST TO KILL TIME UNTIL THE  I-PHONE GOT HERE? OKAY. IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS WITH ME  WHEN I'M ON THE TOILET BUT MY  I-PHONE CAN ENTERTAIN ME IN THE MEN'S ROOM. THIS IS MY FRIEND. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
I DO KNOW. I DO.
Stephen: CHECKING MY EMAILS,  EVERYTHING. CHECKING STATS. CHECKING MY BOARD SCORES. STUFF LIKE THAT. ARE YOU ON FACEBOOK.
I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK. I GOT OFF FACEBOOK.
Stephen: HOW DO YOUR  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FRIENDS SEND  YOU PICTURES OF THEIR BABIES?
ON FACEBOOK YOU'RE GETTING  INVITED TO BE FRIENDS WITH  PEOPLE THAT YOU SPENT 30 YEARS GETTING AWAY FROM. THE PAST COMES FORWARD. THEY WANT TO BE RIGHT UP THERE  WITH YOUR CURRENT FRIENDS. MEANWHILE FACEBOOK HAS BIG DATA  ENGINES THAT ARE BRINGING YOU  ADVERTISEMENTS FROM YOUR FUTURE FOR THINGS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW  YOU YET WANT TO BUY.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I'M SO  GRATEFUL TO FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE  FOR LETTING ME KNOW THE THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW I WANTED.
OR YOU WERE GOING TO WANT. Stephen: I'M GOING TO WANT  THEM, EXACTLY.
BUT IT COSTS YOU GETTING TO  BE WITH REAL PEOPLE IN THE  MOMENT.
Stephen: WHAT IF OTHER PEOPLE  ARE ALSO DOING THIS? THEN WE'RE SHARING A MOMENT OF  NOT SHARING.
WE ARE COLLECTIVELY SHARING  THAT MOMENT OF NOT SHARING. THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: SO YOU SAY THAT  WE'RE PEOPLE WHO NO LONGER HAVE  A FUTURE.
LOOK AT INVESTORS TODAY. THEY DON'T INVEST IN A STOCK IN  ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE MONEY IN  THE FUTURE. THEY TRY TO INVEST IN A  DERIVATIVE THAT IS A STOCK IN  THE FUTURE, RIGHT? YOU BUY A STOCK 30 DAYS FROM  NOW. DERIVATIVES HAVE GOTTEN SO BIG  THEY'VE ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE  STOCK EXCHANGE. THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE WAS  BOUGHT BY ITS OWN ABSTRACTION  WAS BOUGHT BY ITS OWN FUTURE.
LIKE THE SNAIL HAS THE TAIL  IN ITS OWN MOUTH.
BY AN ABSTRACTION OF A TAIL. Stephen: NOT EVEN THE REAL  TAIL.
NOT EVEN THE REAL TAIL. Stephen: YOU JUST BLEW MY  MIND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF. THE PRESENT SHOCK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
