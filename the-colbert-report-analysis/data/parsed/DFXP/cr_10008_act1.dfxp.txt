STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. MR. AND MRS.  AMERICA. NATION, YOU KNOW IT IS DAY 10 OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. YOU KNOW WHAT DAY 10. LET ME ACTUALLY JUST ADD THAT TO MY FREQUENT SHUTDOWN PUNCH CARD HERE. RIGHT THERE. OH, HEY! I WIN A FREE C.D.C. EBOLA MORNINGY. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FANTASTIC. NOW, FOLKS, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, THERE ARE DRAMATIC NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OBAMA-BOEHNER SHUTDOWN DEBT CEILING TAG TEAM DEATH MATCH. THERE HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN SOME PROGRESS IN THAT THEY HAVE FOUND NEW THINGS TO COMPLETELY DISAGREE ABOUT. ALL RIGHT, THAT, INFORMATION, THAT IS THE BIG NEWS. BUT I'VE ONLY TOLD IT TO YOU SO FAR. I HAVEN'T NEWSED IT AT AWE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IS THE ULTIMATE SHOW OF A TV NEWSMAN. YOU MAY NOT THEN BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN THE BIZ, BUT WE IN BROADCASTING TEND TO MODEL OURSELVES ON OUR  HEROES. SEAN HANNITY MODELED HIMSELF ON GROUND BEEF. ( LAUGHTER ) I MYSELF, I MYSELF, LOOK TO THE UNSHAKABLE CONFIDENCE OF THE BILL O'REILLY, THE REASSURING STATESMANSHIP OF PETER JENNINGS, AND THE BEING ON TV OF BILL HEMMER. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT FOX NEWS ANCHOR SHEPSMITH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY PERSONAL HERO, SO PERSONAL THAT I'VE KEPT IT FROM EVERYONE, INCLUDING MYSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SEE, SHEPHAS A FOOL-PROOF INTERNAL BAROMETER FOR WHEN THE COUNTRY NEEDS A BREAK FROM THIS KIND OF WASHINGTON INFIGHTING. SO INSTEAD, HE REPORTS ON A DAREDEVIL BEING PUSHED OUT OF A PLANED IN A COFFIN, THE VIDEO OF WHICH SHEP DOES NOT HAVE.
THERE WE GO. THAT'S THE CLOUDS. AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE PLANE WILL FLY BY THERE, MOMENTS AWAY, FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, PLANE WILL FLY RIGHT BY, AND THEY'RE GOING TO PUSH A GUY IN A BOX THAT LOOKS LIKE A COFFIN, AND HE WILL FLOAT, AND HIS PARENTS WILL BE PROUD. GUY FLYING THROUGH AIR. TRY TO IMAGINE. , EVERYONE TOGETHER, CLOSE YOUR EYE.
Stephen:  THEY'RE CLOSED, SHEP. MY MIND IS A BLANK CANVAS, PAINT ME A PICTURE OF THE NEWS.
THERE'S A MAN IN A BOX TRYING TO DISCONNECT HANDCUFFS HE DOES NOT HAVE A KEY. HE'S RACING FEVERISHLY. THE G-FORCES ARE VERY STRONG, THE FLYING CONTINUES, WHO, WHO. I DON'T KNOW. OH, HERE WE GO. WAS THAT IT? ZOOM IN NOW. NO, THAT WAS A BREAKUP IN THE FEED. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  FOLKS I THINK WE'LL ALL REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE DIDN'T SEE THAT. NOW OF COURSE THE UPTRAINED VIEWER MIGHT LOOK AT SHEP'S MISREPORTING AND ASK WHY? I REPLY BECAUSE, SHEP.
KITTY CAT MEOW, $1,000. SNOOKI'S PREGNANT.
Stephen:  NOW KEEN-EYED FOX VIEWERS MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT SHEP SMITH HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM THE AIRWAVES FOR LAST MONTH. THIS WEEK, WE FOUND OUT WHERE HE WENT-- TO THE FUTURE OF NEWS.
WE'VE BEEN BUSY WHILE I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM YOUR TV BOX. WE BROUGHT IN A LOT OF NEW TOOLS TO HUP BRING YOU THE NEWS. THIS IS THE NEW HUB FOR BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE FOR ALL THE FOX NEWS CHANNELS. WE CALL IT THE FOX NEWS DECK.
Stephen:  IT'S LIKE STAR TRUCK POLO DECK. IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY NEWS, BUT IT'S ALL AN ILLILIZATION. AND, FOLKS, THE STAR SHEP ENTERPRISE OBSERVES THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF TV JOURNALISM-- BIGGER PLUS ELECTRIC EQUALS INFORMATION. JIM.

Stephen:  IT'S INCREDIBLE. SHEP CAN MOVE AROUND IMAGES OF DEVASTATION WITH THE FLICK OF HIS CONTROLLER. IT'S LIKE HE'S PLAYING WII TRAGEDY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THE NEWS DECK GETS ITS INFO THE SAME WAY YOU DO-- FROM SOME GUY ON TWITTER.
