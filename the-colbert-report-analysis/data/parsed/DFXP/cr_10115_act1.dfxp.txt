[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE REPORT." GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. FOLKS AT HOME, IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE SHOW LIVE, YOU'VE GOT TO COME HERE TO THE STUDIO TO SEE THE SHOW IN PERSON, BECAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T GET AT HOME IS THAT RIGHT NOW IN THIS ROOM, THE AIR IS THICK WITH THE OPIATE OF LOVE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND I'M TAKING DEEP TOKES OFF THESE PEOPLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. DON'T DO DRUGS. NATION, THE MIDTERMS ARE RAPIDLY APPROACHING, AND THINGS LOOK GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE BOARD WITH ONE GLARING EXCEPTION. THE G.O.P. CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE WITH HISPANIC VOTERS FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE NOT RALLYING TO THE G.O.P.'S MESSAGE OF "LOOK, MARCO RUBIO!" BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO REACH OUT TO SUBURBAN FUTBOL MADRES AND AVERAGE JOSE SEIS-PACKS. BUT A NEW STRATEGY HAS BEEN PIONEERED BY ARIZONA REPUBLICAN SCOTT FISTLER, SEEN HERE PHOTOBOMBING A PICTURE OF A MAP AFTER... [LAUGHTER] AFTER LOSING TWO RACES IN A HEAVILY HISPANIC COMMUNITY. HE HAS FOUND A WAY TO GET HIS NAME OUT THERE. GET ANOTHER NAME OUT THERE.
CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING A CANDIDATE SEEKING OFFICE HERE IN ARIZONA. SCOTT FISTLER HAS LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO  CESAR CHAVEZ.
Stephen: ADIOS, SCOTT FISTLER. HOLA, CESAR CHAVEZ. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM, PRETEND YOU JOINED 'EM. NOW, IF CESAR CHAVEZ STRIKES A CORD WITH MY HISPANIC VIEWER, IT'S BECAUSE IT IS ALSO THE NAME OF THE FOUNDER OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS WHO POPULARIZED THE SLOGAN, "SI SE PUEDA," WHICH MEANS "YES, WE, CAN," ALTHOUGH  IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY, CHAVEZ MIGHT BE SAYING, "OH, NO HE DIDN'T." BUT THIS ISN'T MERELY POLITICAL PANDERING, FOLKS, THIS CHANGE WAS A LONG TIME COMING. AS THE POLITICIAN FORMALLY KNOWN AS FISTLER EXPLAINED, HE EXPERIENCED MANY HARDSHIPS BECAUSE OF HIS NAME. I DON'T SEE WHY. I MEAN, FISTLER, THAT'S A GREAT NAME FOR A LEADER. IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S THE HITLER OF FISTING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HEIL FISTLER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HEIL FISTLER. [LAUGHTER] SO FISTLER JUST WANTED TO CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A POPULAR NAME WITH VOTERS. SO I THINK IT SHOWED GREAT RESTRAINT THAT HE DIDN'T JUST GO WITH CHERRY GARCIA. [LAUGHTER] BUT CESAR CHAVEZ'S CAMPAIGN ISN'T JUST ABOUT A CONFUSING NAME. IT'S ALSO ABOUT A CONFUSING WEB SITE.
ON HIS CAMPAIGN WEB SITE, CHAVEZ FEATURES IMAGES OF CROWDS OF PEOPLE HOLDING CHAVEZ SIGNS AND WEARING T-SHIRTS, BUT THE PICTURES ARE ACTUALLY FROM A RALLY FROM THE LATE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ.
Stephen: OH, OH, OH. SO ALL HISPANIC RALLIES LOOK ALIKE? THAT IS RACIST. UNFORTUNATELY THE WEBSITE IS UNCLEAR ABOUT HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAMPAIGN. DO I USE THIS "DONATE NOW" BUTTON UP HERE AT THE TOP, OR ONE OF THESE NINE "DONATE NOW" BUTTONS DOWN HERE. I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE. YOU NEED ONE BUTTON FOR EACH CANDIDATE HE'S PRETENDING TO BE. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, SENOR CHAVEZ'S STRATEGY SHOWS HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016. JUST FIELD A SLATE OF MINORITY CANDIDATES. THERE'S LOTS OF CHOICES. THERE'S PANCHO VILLA, MARTIN LUTHER KING, MAHATMA GANDHI, AUNG SAN SUU KYI, HARRIET TUBMAN, SITTING BULL. OH, SITTING BULL'S GOT A REAL CHANCE, WELL, UNLESS HILLARY CLINTON DECIDES TO RUN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NATION... LAST WEEK I TOLD YOU ABOUT RESCUED ARMY SERGEANT BOWE BERGDAHL AND THE GROWING CABLE NEWS CONSENSUS THAT HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE ALIVE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHO WE GAVE UP FOR HIM.
FIVE TALIBAN KILLERS, ESSENTIALLY THE CABINET OF THE TALIBAN.
IT'S NOT JUST ANY RANDOM ACCUSED TERRORISTS BUT FIVE TALIBAN COMMANDERS.
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM IS CALLING THE FORMER DETAINEES THE "TALIBAN DREAM TEAM."
THE PRESIDENT SWAPPED AN ALLEGED DESERTER FOR THE TALIBAN DREAM TEAM.
THE TALIBAN DREAM TEAM.
THE DREAM TEAM.
WE GAVE UP THE DREAM TEAM. GREAT! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] GREAT. NOW WHO ARE WE GOING TO SEND TO THE RIO OLYMPICS IN 2016? ABDUL WAS DEADLY IN THE PAINT. WELL, DEADLY PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE, BUT ESPECIALLY THE PAINT. MEANWHILE, BERGDAHL'S A DESERTER WHO DID BALLET, WHOSE DAD HAS A BEARD AND WHO PURSUED A LIFESTYLE THAT 99% OF AMERICANS CANNOT RELATE TO, VOLUNTEERING TO FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN. THE POINT IS: EVERYTHING ABOUT BERGDAHL IS AN AFFRONT TO THE HEROS WHO SERVE ON THE FRONT LINES OF FOX NEWS.
BERGDAHL MAY HAVE EVEN COLLABORATED WITH THE ENEMY, THE TALIBAN.
CLEARLY THE WORDS ARE WRITTEN ON THE WALL THAT HE WAS A DESERTER.
A LOSER, A DESERTER WHO HAS KILLED MEN.
HE'S A TRAITOR.
IT SEEMS TO ME HE'S PRETTY LUCKY HE WAS BROUGHT HOME THE WAY HE WAS BECAUSE IF THOSE SPECIAL FORCES HAD FOUND HIM, HE WOULD HAVE COME HOME EITHER IN A BODY BAG OR COME HOME AND GONE STRAIGHT TO JAIL.
THAT'S RIGHT, KIMBERLY. IF OUR SOLDIERS HAD FOUND HIM, THEY MIGHT HAVE ARRESTED HIM, BUT THEY JUST AS LIKELY WOULD HAVE MURDERED HIM IN A HEROIC ACT OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE LIKE IN THE MOVIE  "FRAGGING PRIVATE RYAN." [LAUGHTER] BUT EVEN MORE DISTURBING, EVEN MORE DISTURBING THAN THE RESCUE OF THIS TRAITOROUS DESERTER WHO DESERVED A FIELD EXECUTION IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT HIS FIVE YEARS OF TALIBAN CAPTIVITY MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME SAD PARTS THAT MAKE HIM SYMPATHETIC.
BERGDAHL HAS TOLD MILITARY OFFICIALS HIS CAPTIVITY WAS A TERRIFYING AND LONELY ORDEAL WITH LONG PERIODS OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THAT ONLY GOT WORSE WHEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE.
ARMY SERGEANT BOWE BERGDAHL IS TELLING HIS DOCTORS THAT THE TALIBAN TORTURED AND BEAT HIM DURING FIVE YEARS OF CAPTIVITY.
DURING ALL THIS TIME, HE STRUCK TO HIS RELIGION, CHRISTIANITY. THE TALIBAN SAY THAT THEY GAVE HIM PERMISSION TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: AND WORSE, WHILE HE WAS CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS, THE TALIBAN WISHED HIM HAPPY HOLIDAYS. FOLKS, FOLKS, THIS IS SO UNFAIR. HOW CAN BERGDAHL BE A GOOD CHRISTIAN? YOU DON'T SEE JESUS WALKING OFF INTO THE DESERT. IS THERE ANY WAY... IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN SAY THAT HIS TORTURE WASN'T SO BAD?
HE DID, BERGDAHL, ADMIT THAT HE WAS TORTURED BY THE TALIBAN AND KEPT IN A CAGE AFTER AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IS WHAT HIS ACCOUNT IS RELAYING RIGHT NOW.
YEAH, SO THAT WAS REPORTED ON FRIDAY THAT THEY HAD A CUSTOMIZED CAGE WITH HIM AND LEFT HIM IN THERE MAYBE IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
THIS GUY HAD HIS OWN CUSTOMIZED CAGE? OH, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE CONFINED IN AN OFF-THE-SHELF CAGE. I'M TOO FANCY FOR THAT. I WANT ONE WITH BRUSHED STEEL BARS AND A MONOGRAMMED POOP BUCKET. OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD START. HE'S GOT FANCY CAGE. BUT COULD WE MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE ACTUALLY LIKED THESE GUYS?
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE TO ANYONE THAT HE WAS TORTURED AND IT WAS HORRIFIC. THERE WAS A REPORT TOO ON THIS CHANNEL THAT BY THE END OF HIS CAPTIVITY, HE WAS PLAYING SOCCER WITH THESE GUYS.
Stephen: PLAYING SOCCER WITH THESE GUYS? FOR ALL WE KNOW THE TALIBAN'S MOM BROUGHT ORANGE SLICES. IT SOUNDS FUN. I'M BETTING GETTING CAPTURED WAS CLEARLY HIS GOOOOOOOAL! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT CAN WE PROVE THAT BEND IT [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT CAN WE PROVE THAT BEND IT LIKE BERGDAHL HERE IS ON THE TALIBAN'S SIDE? WELL, LUCKILY CNN FOUND A WAY TO BOIL THIS COMPLEX STORY DOWN TO THE ONE QUESTION THAT MATTERS: DO YOU WATCH "HOMELAND"?
IT'S A STORY WITH SO MANY SUBPLOTS THAT NO WONDER MANY ARE COMPARING BERGDAHL TO BRODY, THE FREED AMERICAN HOSTAGE ON SHOWTIME'S "HOMELAND."
YOU ALMOST THINK YOU'RE WATCHING "HOMELAND."
Stephen: YES, AND I'D ALMOST THINK I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU SEE, BERGDAHL'S STORY IS [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU SEE, BERGDAHL'S STORY IS EXACTLY LIKE THE SHOWTIME DRAMA "HOMELAND" ABOUT A RESCUED P.O.W. WHO MAY HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED BY ISLAMIC RADICALS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE SIMILARITIES ARE NEARLY EXISTENT.
LOOK AT THE SHOWS. THERE WERE FAMILIES INVOLVED. THERE WAS A REINTEGRATION BACK IN SOCIETY.
THE SHOW "HOMELAND" ORIGINATED IN ISRAEL. AND ISRAEL HAD REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE PRISONER SWAPS. HOPEFULLY HE WASN'T WATCHING "HOMELAND" AND MODELING HIS STORY AFTER THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T END WELL FOR BRODY YES, I CERTAINLY HOPE HE WASN'T WATCHING SHOWTIME IN HIS CUSTOMIZED TALIBAN CAGE. [APPLAUSE] OR WORSE, STARZ. THAT IS TORTURE. FOLKS, IT ALL LINES UP. THEY BOTH HAVE FAMILIES. THEY BOTH COME FROM SOCIETY. HOMELAND ORIGINATED IN ISRAEL AND BERGDAHL IS REAL. I'M TELLING YOU, I'M TELLING YOU, FOLKS, YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS STUFF UP, ALTHOUGH WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
