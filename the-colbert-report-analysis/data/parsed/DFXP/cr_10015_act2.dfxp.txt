THIS IS THE NEW HUB FOR BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE FOR ALL OF FOX NEWS CHANNEL. WE CALL IT THE FOX NEWS DECK. IT ALLOWS ME TO MANIPULATE THIS 38-FOOT-LONG VIDEO WALL. YOU'LL SEE ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF THIS MASSIVE WALL OVER HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE NEWSWORTHY. WE CALL THESE BATS. "BIG AREA TOUCH SCREENS."

Stephen: LOOK AT SHEP'S HAND HELD BIODEGRADABLE INFO SHEET! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN -- LOOK AT THAT THING! FLAT SCREENS ARE IMPRESSIVE BUT THAT THING IS PAPER THIN! (LAUGHTER) NOW OBVIOUSLY THIS MAY CAUSE SOME TO ASK "WHAT WERE ALL THOSE SCREENS FOR? IS HE GOING TO USE THEM TO PLAY ANGRY BIRDS?" WRONG!
IT MAY BE THE MOST ADDICTIVE ONLINE GAME EVER. (LAUGHTER) CANDY CRUSH. THE OBJECT IS YOU MATCH THESE COLORFUL GROUPS OF CANDY IN THREE OR MORE TO CLEAR THE BOARD AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU SUGGESTIONS LIKE WATCH THIS -- SEE THAT BLINKING? THEIR SUGGESTIONS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG. IT HAS A NICE SOUND. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE AUDIO FROM IT. IT'S NOT A NICE SOUND AT ALL. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S FUN ANYMORE OR IF I'M A COMPLETED A DETECTIVE.
Stephen: NOW WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO ONE OF JOURNALISM'S ETERNAL QUESTION: WHAT DOES SHEP SMITH DO WHILE HE POOPS? (LAUGHTER) TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS OF HIS CANDY CRUSH ADDICTION, SHEP BROUGHT IN AN EXPERT.
COOPER SHRAURPBS A PSYCHOLOGIST AND HAPPENS TO BE A CANDY CRUSHER JUST AS I AM. ARE YOU AN ADDICT?

A FASCINATING STORY THOUGH EVIDENTLY NOT TO SHEP WHO'S TOO BUSY CRUSHING CANDY. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, WHEN HE'S PLAYING CANDY CRUSH NOTHING DISTRACTS SHEP.
