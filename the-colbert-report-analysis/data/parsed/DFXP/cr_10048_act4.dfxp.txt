WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, BEFORE WE GO TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO BRAG BUT I KNOW HOW TO READ. THAT'S WHY I FORMED THE COLBERT BOOK CLUB, A PLACE WITH BOOK LOVERS OF ALL STRIPES CAN COME TOGETHER AND DRINK THEIR WEIGHT IN CHEAP CHARDONNAY. FIRE UP YOUR READING GLASSES BECAUSE IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER INSTALLMENT, WHICH AUTHOR THIS TIME? WELL, WE HAD CURIOUS GEORGE ALL LINED UP BUT SADLY LAST WEEK HE FLEW INTO A RAGE AND SAVAGELY DISFIGURED THE MAN WITH THE YELLOW HAT. ARTISTS, SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SETTLE FOR MY NEXT FAVORITE LITERARY GIANT, ERNEST HEMINGWAY AND HIS CLASSIC, A FAREWELL TO ARMS. WE'LL DISCUSS IT NEXT TUESDAY, JANUARY 21st WITH SPECIAL GUEST FAMED AUTHOR MICHAEL CHABON AND ERNIE'S GRANDDAUGHTER MARIEL HEMINGWAY, AND TIME PERMITTING, A HERD OF ANGRY BULLS. SO GET READING, NATION, GOOD NIGHT.      Captioning sponsored by      COMEDY CENTRAL  Captioned by      Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
