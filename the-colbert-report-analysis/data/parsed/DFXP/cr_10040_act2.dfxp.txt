WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NATION, THIS IS MY FINAL SHOW BEFORE THE 2013 CELEBRATION OF CHRISTMAS. WHICH OF COURSE I LOVE. I ALSO LOVE THAT I WILL BE LEAVING 2013 ON A SERIOUS NOTE. BECAUSE THE PC POLICE HAVE PULLED OVER YET ANOTHER PATRIOT.
DUCK DYNASTY IS MAKING HEADLINES FOR OFF CAMERA DRAMA. PHIL ROBERTSON, THE STAR OF THE A & E HIT SHOW HAS BEEN SUSPENDED INDEFINITELY FROM FILMING THE REALITY SHOW AFTER MAKING CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS.
Stephen: THIS IS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR AMERICANS. SO ADMITTEDLY A PRETTY GOOD DAY FOR DUCKS. NOW JUST WHY DID A & E AXE HIM? BECAUSE THIS GOOD CHRISTIAN MAN SPOKE HIS MIND TO GQ ABOUT THE GAYS SAYING IT SEEMS LIKE TO MEAN A VAGINA AS A MAN WOULD BE MORE DESIRABLE THAN A MAN'S ANUS. THAT'S JUST ME, I'M JUST THINKING, THERE'S MORE THERE. BUT HEY, IT'S NOT LOGICAL, MY MAN, START WITH HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND MORPH OUT FROM THERE, BESTIALIT, NOW I'LL ADMIT, I WILL ADMIT, I WILL ADMIT IT'S NOT ELOQUENT SPEECH YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM A BACKWOODS LOUISIANA BIRD MURDERERS, BUT HE DOES HAVE A POINT. THE VAGINA DOES HAVE MORE THERE I MEAN LET'S FACE T IT'S A TRAIN WRECK, WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT BUSINESS. FANS RALLIED TO HIM. WITH 55,000 SIGNING A PETITION SAYING MR. ROBERTSON'S COMMENTS IN "GQ" MAGAZINE ARE REFLECTIVE OF A BIBLICAL VIEW OF SEXUALITY, MARRIAGE AND FAMILY. YEAH, IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE BIBLE. MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE BECAUSE WITH THE VAGINA THERE'S MORE THERE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, FOLKS, TONIGHT -- -- (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, FOLKS, TONIGHT -- -- (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TOJT TONIGHT WE ARE ALL PHIL ROBERTSON. PHIL HAS TAUGHT US SO MUCH LIKE THIS LITTLE BIT OF ETERNAL WISDOM.
IF YOU CATCH SQUIRRELS FOR YOUR WALLET-- YOUR WOMAN WILL NEVER CUT YOU OFF IN BED.
Stephen: AND IF SHE DOES, HEY, YOU STILL GOT THE SQUIRRELS. AND IT'S NOT LIKE HE SINGLED OUT HOMOSEXUALS. HE ALSO WAXD  NOSTALGIA-- NOSTALGIC FOR THE JIM CROW ERA, HE SAID I HAVE NEVER IN MY SIGH EYES SEEN ANY MISDREAM OF BLACKS. THEY ARE SING AND HAPPY, I NEVER HEARD ONE, THESE DOGGONE WHITE PEOPLE, NOT A WORD. FREE ENTITLE THEMENT, THEY WERE GODLY, THEY WERE HAPPY NO ONE WAS SING THE BLUES. YES, BUT PEOPLE HAD NOTHING TO SING THE BLUES ABOUT, FOR PETE'S SAKE, THEY GOT THEIR OWN WATER FOUNTAIN. IN FACT, THEY HAD IT SO GOOD WHITE PEOPLE PRETENDED TO BE THEM. I TELL YOU, WHO I KNEEL SORRY FOR, FOLKS, A & EW THIS CONTROVERSY, THEY MAY HAVE JUST LOST DUCK DYNASTY'S MASSIVE BLACK AND GAY AUDIENCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
