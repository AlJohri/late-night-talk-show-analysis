(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY MY GUEST IS A MULTIPLATINUM GRAMMY WINNING SINGER/SONGWRITER OR YOU MAY KNOW HIM, A LOSER. PLEASE WELCOME BECK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, BECK. THANKS FOR BEING HERE, MAN. RABBI, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. UNLESS THIS IS AN AMISH LOOK YOU ARE GOING FOR.
IT'S KIND OF A MIXTURE.
Stephen: EITHER YENTL OR WITNESS, WE'LL FIND OUT. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE YOU CRASHED ON MY COUCH IN L.A..
THANK YOU FOR THE KINDNESS.
Stephen: NO PROBLEM. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH YOUR CV. LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE HEAT OF THE MEAT. YOU'VE GOT A NEW ALBUM CALLED MORNING PHASE.
UH-HUH, PRETTY MEATY.
Stephen: IT'S PRETTY MEATY. THE MORNING PHASE, THIS IS A KINDLER GENTLER MORE CONTEMPLATIVE BECK HERE, A LITTLE FOLKY IN HERE.
A LITTLE QUIET, A LITTLE BIT SLOW, GOOD FOR MASSAGES, AROMA THERAPY.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY LIKE --
TRYING TO BREAK INTO THAT.
Stephen: ANY FLUTE.
A LITTLE-- .
Stephen: GREAT, YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY SELL IT AS AT STARBUCKS WITH A LITTLE MASSAGE OIL.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, ESSENTIAL OILS. WHY DO YOU JUMP AROUND IN STYLES SO MANY TIMES. IT MUST BE HELL ON RECORD STORE CLERKS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PUT YOUR NEXT ALBUM. YOU KNOW, I'LL PUT IT UNDER NEO LOW-FI RAVE FUNK. DUDE, WHY DO YOU SKIP AROUND SO MUCH WHY NOT JUST SETTLE DOWN IN ONE STYLE AND BE HAPPY.
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST NEED TO SETTLE DOWN.
Stephen: IF SOMEBODY MET YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME, DIDN'T KNOW YOUR MUSIC AND SAID SO YOU ARE A MUSICIAN, WHAT IS YOUR MUSIC LIKE.
KIND OF HOW YOU DESCRIBED IT, I THINK.
Stephen: NEO LOW-FI RAVE FUNK.
YEAH. JUNGLE DUB COOLOUT LOUNGE BANJO AS WELL.
Stephen: COOL OUT LOUNGE BANJO. IS THERE ANY OF THAT ONTHIS.
A LOT OF HYPHENS
Stephen: YOUR LAST PROJECT SONG READER WAS JUST SHEET MUSIC. YOU DIDN'T RECORD IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY. WHY DID-- WHY DID YOU DO THAT? WERE A LOT OF FANS COMING UP TO YOU SAYING I LOVE YOUR MUSIC, I JUST HATE YOU PLAYING IT. (LAUGHTER)
I GOT TIRED OF ME PLAYING IT
Stephen: DO YOU EVER FEEL ANY PRESSURE WHEN YOU'VE WRITTEN SOMETHING YOU THINK IS GOOD THAT YOU MIGHT SCREW IT UP WHEN YOU RECORD IT.
I THINK THAT ALL THE TIME. I THINK THERE ARE SONGS THAT ARE GOOD AND THEN I RECORD THEM AND THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD.
Stephen: LIKE THEY'RE PERFECT UP HERE, THEY'RE PERFECT UP HERE.
OR I CAN HEAR SOMEBODY ELSE SINGING IT BETTER.
Stephen: THAT HAS BEEN TURNED INTO AN ALBUM AS WELL. SONG LEADER, YOU PRODUCED THAT.
A COMPILATION.
Stephen: OTHER PEOPLE HAVING RECORDED YOUR MUSIC.
AND THERE'S A JACK WHITE SONG THERE AND JEFF TWEEDY FROM WILCO.
Stephen: ARE THEY BETTER AT YOUR MUSIC THAN YOU ARE.
I THINK THEY ARE, YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY.
YEAH. I THINK I'M ON TO SOMETHING.
Stephen: NO, NO. THIS LATEST ALBUM, I HEARD TWO OF THE SONGS YOU WILL BE DOING TONIGHT. IT IS-- IT'S A SOFTER, MORE CONTEMPLATIVE, WHY BECK SAD? IS BECK SAD?
I JUST NEED A HUG. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH BECK, MORNING PHASE.
