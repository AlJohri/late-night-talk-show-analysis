Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. HERE, GET THESE PEOPLE SOME EXERCISE. NATION, THERE ARE ONLY 334 SHOPPING DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE 2014 MIDTERM ELECTIONS, BUY YOUR CANDIDATE NOW. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A PUEBLO YOUTH, UNFORTUNATELY THE GOP IS HAVING SOME SERIOUS LADY TROUBLES AND NOT THE KIND OF LADY TROUBLES THAT CAN BE SOLVED WITH A QUARANTINE TENT. ACCORDING TO AN OCTOBER ABC,/WASHINGTON POST/FLINTSTONES CHEWABLES POLL 63 PERCENT OF WOMEN HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I DON'T GET IT, OVER 90 PERCENT OF CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS ARE DUDES. LADY IT'S A SAUSAGE FEST. IT IS RAINING MEN, HALLELUJAH, IT IS RAINING MEN!
BELLY UP TO THE BUFFET.
FOLKS, THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS OUT THERE, APPEALS TO WOMEN IN 2014, REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING SOMETHING NEW, ANYTHING.
ACCORDING TO THE POLITICO, JOHN BOEHNER'SED TO AIDES HELD A SEMINAR TO DISCUSS HOW LAWMAKERS SHOULD TALK TO FEMALE CONSTITUENTS AND IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT ONE OF OUR TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES WOULD NEED LESSONS ON HOW TO TALK TO THE MAJORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE. AND THE REPUBLICAN SEMINAR -- THIS REPUBLICAN SEMINAR HAD SOME GREAT ADVICE ON CONNECTING WITH THE LADIES.
THE GOP IS TEACHING ITS MALE CANDIDATES NOT TO USE PHRASES LIK TODD AIKEN DID LEGITIMATE RAPE, SO THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD TALK TO WOMEN, TO HAVE WOMEN'S FORUM, IN TERMS OF KIND OF WOMEN'S ISSUES, TALK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY, THINGS LIKE THAT.
ALL.
THEY SHOULD COME TALK TO ME BECAUSE I AM AN EXPERT ON WOMEN, I WATCHED A PILATES CLASS ONE I EVEN TRIED JANE FONDA'S POOPY YOGURT. NOT BAD. IT WAS NOT BAD. I MEAN YOU COULD BARELY TASTE THE POOP.
SO, GOP REPS, FAKE A SEAT, GENTLEMEN AND LET ME GIVE YOU THE LOWDOWN ON HOW TO SPEAK RESPECTIVELY TO THE BITCHES. OKAY. RULE NUMBER ONE, LADIES, DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU USE CERTAIN TERMS, FOR INSTANCE RAPE. LEGITIMATE OR PANTIES. THEY REALLY, THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT ONE. PANTIES. OKAY.
TWO YOU WANT TO REACH OUT TO WOMEN SO YOU HAVE TO GO WHERE THEY CONGREGATE SO HANG OUT IN THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM.
OF COURSE   SHOWMENT A PHILADELPHIA VOTER APPROACH YOU, DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED, THEY CAN SENSE FEAR. ATTEMPT TO BE LARGER THAN YOU ARE, RAISE UP YOUR HAND AND POP OUT YOUR CHEST BUT IF SHE INFLATES HER NECK FRILL, RUN.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, MOST IMPORTANTLY, APPEAL TO THEM ON THE ISSUES, NOT COME UP WITH AN EASY MNEMONIC DEVICE TO WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT, PAY EQUALITY, ABORTION RIGHTS, NATIONAL DEFENSE, INSURANCE, EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SECURITY ARE -- PANTIES. DAMN IT!  DAMN IT!  THAT IS, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. JUST TRY APPEALING TO THE GAYS. I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE ANY WOMEN. WE WILL BE
