Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A MEADE YEN  WHOM YOU MAY KNOW FROM COSTANZA. PLEASE WELCOME JERRY SEINFELD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, JERRY, GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN.
GREAT, GREAT TO BE HERE. Stephen: SO EXCITING TO SEE  YOU DOING A SHOW AGAIN.
YEAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I'M TALKING ABOUT MY SHOW, OF  COURSE.
EXACTLY. Stephen: BUT YOU HAD THE TV  SHOW ON THE NATIONAL BROADCAST.
I DID YES. Stephen: NOW YOU'RE THE  EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND STAR OF  THE WEB SERIES MEADE YENS AND CARS GETTING COFFEE. OKAY.
OKAY. Stephen: WE DON'T HAVE TO  TALK ABOUT IT.
IT'S NOT REALLY AN EXECUTIVE  PRODUCER.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT? WHO CALLS THE SHOTS, JERRY.
I DO. Stephen: YOU'RE THE EXECUTIVE  PRODUCER. YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF WHAT YOU  WANT. YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF GRAND  VIZZIER BUT THE GUY WHO CALLS  THE SHOTS IS THE EXEC.
I'M NOT REALLY AN EXEC. Stephen: ARE YOU DOING... DO  YOU HAVE A NETWORK BEHIND YOU?
I DO HAVE A NETWORK. IT'S CALLED THE INTERNET.
Stephen: WOW. THAT'S MY NETWORK. Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THIS. I'M INTRIGUED. IT'S VERY POPULAR WITH THE KIDS.
VERY POPULAR WITH THE KIDS. Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY GET IN  A CAR WITH EVERY SHOW.
THAT'S RIGHT. Stephen: AND WITH A COMEDIAN. HAVE YOU SEEN THE SHOW. Stephen: I HAVE, YEAH. VERY SIMPLE. Stephen: IT IS VERY SIMPLE. THE IDEA OF THE TITLE IS SO I  WOULDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER THESE  QUESTIONS. THAT'S THE IDEA.
Stephen: I'M JUST MAKING SURE  THAT THERE'S NOT SOME SORT OF  SUB TEXT I DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, A CAR, YOU  KNOW, A CIGAR IS JUST A CIGAR  BUT A CAR CAN OFTEN BE A  SUBSTITUTE.
OKAY. Stephen: YOU DESCRIBE THE  CAR. YOU DESCRIBE THE CAR. ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE IS I  WAS WATCHING THE PORSCHE ONE. WITH SETH MYERS. AND YOU TAKE A LONG TIME  DESCRIBING THE CAR THAT YOU'RE  IN.
I DO LIKE CARS. AND I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEM  JUST FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AT  THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. JUST BECAUSE IT'S A WEIRD THING  TO DO.
Stephen: YOU ALWAYS LIKE TO  DESCRIBE WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE  YOU'RE SITTING.
YEAH, I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT  THINGS THAT WE'RE ALL INTERESTED  IN.
Stephen: WE'RE AT 151 WEST  54th STREET RIGHT NOW. THAT CONVERTED TO THE DAILY  SHOW. WHEN HE LEFT I TOOK IT OVER. WE'RE AT A SOLID WOOD TABLE THAT  HAS A LEAF RIGHT HERE. WE'RE IN TWO HERMAN MILLER  CHAIRS. DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?
LOOK AT THAT. IS THIS REALLY COFFEE.
Stephen: IT IS. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?
FOX. THAT'S THE BEST KIND OF COFFEE.
Stephen: BASIC CABLE. WE SPARE NO EXPENSE.
THIS IS GREAT. Stephen: SO WHY THOSE THREE  THINGS? I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK  ABOUT.
WHY DO I DESCRIBE THE CAR. Stephen: WHY CARS, COFFEE AND  COMEDIANS?
BECAUSE... BECAUSE THEY'RE  THE THINGS OF NORMAL LIVING.
Stephen: COMEDIANS ARE NOT  NORMAL LIVING. I'M NOT A COMEDIAN.
WELL, YOU ARE. YOU'RE FUNNY.
Stephen: THEY'RE NOT NORMAL. PEOPLE AT THE CLUB SAY I'M  FUNNY.
FOR ME THEY'RE NORMAL. THIS IS MY NORMAL LIFE THAT I  THOUGHT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO  SHOW PEOPLE IN A STRANGE INTERNET KIND OF WAY.
Stephen: LET'S SHOW PEOPLE. LET'S SHOW THEM RIGHT NOW.
YEAH. THE ABILITY TO TALK TO A LOT  OF PEOPLE IS FREAKISH. IT'S MORE FREAKISH TO BE ABLE TO  RUN FAST OR DUNK A BASKETBALL OR  ANY OF THOSE OTHER THINGS. IT'S FREAKISH.
DO YOU THINK SUPERMAN COULD  TALK TO A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT ONE  TIME?
YES. HE CAN GET THEIR ATTENTION  BECAUSE HE HAS TO BEND SOMETHING  FIRST BUT TO JUST GET UP IN FRONT OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND  START TALKING.
GIVE HIM A FEW MINUTES AND  THEN...
THEY WOULD LOSE THE ROOM. BURN SOMETHING WITH HIS X-RAY  VISION OR SOMETHING. HE FLIES AND COMES BACK. OKAY. I'VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: IT'S BEAUTIFUL. WE'VE GOT THE BEAUTIFUL CAR AT  THE TOP. BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHY.
THANK YOU. Stephen: THE SHOW AT THE TOP  IS LIKE MIXED WITH A NIJELLA  LAWSON KIND OF FOOD PORN  PHOTOGRAPHY. IN THE MIDDLE YOU'VE GOT TWO  VERY ENTERTAINING PEOPLE JUST  TALKING TO EACH OTHER.
RIGHT. Stephen: DO YOU PUT ANY  EFFORT INTO THE SHOW AT ALL?
YEAH. Stephen: YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE  YOU'RE JUST KIND OF BIC R  WINGING IT IN A BEAUTIFUL WAY BUT TOTAL WINGING IT.
WHEN I'M DOING THE SHOW, NO. I PUT NO EFFORT INTO IT BECAUSE  WE DON'T HAVE AN AUDIENCE THAT  YOU AND I ARE VERY AWARE OF RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO PLEASE  THEM TO KEEP YOU ON THE AIR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: CAN YOU STICK  AROUND.
SURE, WHY NOT. tephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK  WITH MORE JERRY SEINFELD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
