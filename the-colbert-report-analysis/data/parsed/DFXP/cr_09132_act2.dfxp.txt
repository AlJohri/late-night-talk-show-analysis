[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU  BUT AS A LITTLE BOY IN SOUTH  CAROLINA, GROWING UP, THERE'S NOTHING I LOVED MORE ON A RAINY  AFTERNOON THAN PLAYING BOARD  GAMES WITH MY FAMILY. THE HOT CHOCOLATE, THE  UNEXPECTED LAUGHS, THE EMOTIONAL  BLACKMAIL WHEN A GROWN WOMAN PRESSURES HER EIGHT-YEAR-OLD SON  TO LET MOM HAVE VENTNOR AVENUE  OR ELSE SHE'LL BE OUT OF THE  GAME. YOU DON'T WANT THAT, DO YOU? GAMES LIKE RISK GAVE ME MEMORIES  TO LAST A LIFETIME. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,  JAY. I LEFT KAMCHATKA UNDEFENDED AND  YOU STABBED ME IN THE BACK. WE HAD AN ALLIANCE. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH  ALL THAT QUALITY FAMILY TIME. ALL THAT TIME. THAT'S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE  THIS.
BOARD GAMES ARE MAKING A  COMEBACK BUT IN SHORTER  VERSIONS. GAMES LIKE SCRABBLE AND BOGGLE  AND MONOPOLY ARE RELEASING  SHORTER VERSIONS OF THE GAMES BECAUSE COMPANIES SAY KIDS DON'T  HAVE ENOUGH TIME OR ATTENTION  SPAN ANYMORE.
Stephen: IT'S ABOUT TIME. IT'S TRUE. KIDS TODAY HAVE TIGHT SCHEDULED. BUT HOW DO TOY MAKERS CUT DOWN  ALL THE TIME KIDS WASTE ENJOYING  THEMSELVES?
THE NEW MONOPOLY EMPIRE GAME  LETS PLAYERS BUY BIG-NAME BRANDS  LIKE COKE AND McDONALD'S. GAMES ARE AS QUICK AS 30  MINUTES. TO SPEED THINGS UP, THERE'S NO  MORE "GO TO JAIL" COMMAND.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. NO JAIL SO IT'S FASTER AND IT  TEACHES KIDS WHAT IT'S REALLY  LIKE TO WORK ON WALL STREET. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, I SAY THIS IS JUST WHAT  OUR KIDS NEED. YOU THINK CHINESE CHILDREN ARE  PLAYING WITH TINE OWE TOP HATS  AND THIMBLES? NO. THEY'RE MAKING TINY TOP HATS AND  THIMBLES. I SAY WE BRING THIS KIND OF  MERCILESS CLOCK MANAGEMENT TO  ALL OF OUR CHILDREN'S GAMES. I MEAN IT TAKES FOREVER TO PLAY  SORRY. SO LET'S MAKE IT APOLOGY  ACCEPTED AND GET ON WITH OUR  LIVES. AND WHO HAS AN AFTERNOON TO HUNT  AND PECK AROUND A BATTLESHIP  BOARD? JUST PUT IN THE D.V.D. OF  BATTLESHIP THE MOVIE AND NO ONE  WILL WANT TO PLAY. IN FACT, FOLKS, I'VE DESIGNED MY  OWN HIGH-SPEED BOARD GAME FOR  KIDS ON THE GO. IT'S CALLED "STEPHEN COLBERT'S  SUPER COIN TOSS."  HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE  ENCHANTED REALM OF QUARTERRIA,  ALL RIGHT? EACH PLAYER HAS FARMERS,  SOLDIERS, MERCHANTS AND BANDITS. AND THE OBJECT IS TO CULTIVATE  ENOUGH GRAIN THAT THE MERCHANTS  CAN SELL TO PAY THE SOLDIERS TO PROTECT YOU FROM YOUR OPPONENT'S  BANDITS. AND OF COURSE THERE ARE TWO  GIANT ROBOTS WHO BOX. I CAN'T WAIT. BRANDON, DO YOU WANT TO COME IN  HERE AND PLAY WITH ME? BRANDON, EVERYBODY. OKAY. BRANDON, THERE'S THE GAME FOR  YOU. ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS?
YOU BET. ALL RIGHT. TO START, WE PUT OUR TOKENS --  I'VE GOT A CAR AND YOU'VE GOT A  CHICAGO SKY SCRAPER -- ONE SPACE FROM THE FINISH LINE. THERE YOU GO. AND WHOEVER GOES FIRST WINS THE  GAME. NOW, TO DETERMINE THAT, WE FLIP  THE MEDALLION OF FATE WHICH IS  DESIGNED TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE A U.S. QUARTER, SOLD SEPARATELY  FOR $5. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FUN,  BRANDON?
I'M READY. Stephen: CALL IT IN THE AIR. HEADS. Stephen: HEADS. GOD-DAMN-IT. GET OUT. GET OUT, YOU CHEATER. [BLEEP]. YEAH, GO HOME TO YOUR CHEATING  FAMILY, CHEATER. GOD, THAT TOOK FOREVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
