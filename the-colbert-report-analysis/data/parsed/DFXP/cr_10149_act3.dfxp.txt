STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! FOLKS, MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN THE NEW FILM "LOVE IS STRANGE." IT IS IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN LITHGOW! JOHN! THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK GOOD TO SEE YOU! LOVELY TO HAVE YOU BACK (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I OWE YOU ONE. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, YOU WERE CHECKING MY PROSTATE.
HOW'S IT GOING? THAT'S RIGHT, I GAVE YOU A PROCTOLOGICAL EXAM.
DID YOU GET A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET SAYING HEY, YOU'RE COLBERT'S PROCTOLOGIST! ANY COLBERT BUMP?
NO NOT AT ALL! PEOPLE WON'T EVEN SHAKE  HANDS WITH ME ANYMORE. IT'S INEXPLICABLE!
STEPHEN:  I APOLOGIZE. JUST FIST-BUMP THEM.  NOW JOHN, YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU AND IT'S A LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE YOU'RE A BIG STAR, AN EMMY AND TONY AWARD WINNER AND I KNOW HOLLYWOOD IS CORRUPTING OUR VALUES, ALL RIGHT, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, I'M A FAN, AND MY FEAR IS I'M GOING TO LIKE YOUR NEW MOVIE "LOVE IS STRANGE."
I'M AFRAID IT'S TRUE, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: YEAH, BECAUSE YOU PLAY A GAY GUY.
YES, ALFRED MOLINA AND I, THAT WONDERFUL ACTOR, WE PLAY AN OLD GAY COUPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TOGETHER 40 YEARS, FINALLY GET MARRIED --
STEPHEN: SO YOU'RE LIVING TOGETHER 40 YEARS BEFORE YOU GET MARRIED?
WE HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER.
STEPHEN: NOT ONLY ARE YOU COMMITTING SIN, YOU'RE LIVING IN SIN AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S A TWO FER. GO AHEAD.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WAS THE OLD DEFINITION OF SIN. NOW THEY GET MARRIED, SADLY FRED'S CHARACTER LOSES HIS JOB BECAUSE HIS EMPLOYER DISAPPROVES.
STEPHEN: HE FIRES HIM. THE ARCHDIOCESE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH --
STEPHEN: I'M A CATHOLIC, YOU REALIZE.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
STEPHEN: I DON'T. I DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. SO THEY KICK HIM OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MORAL BEDROCK.
YES. THE SCHOOL DOESN'T WANT TO FIRE HIM BUT, ACCORDING TO THE RULES, HE'S LET GO AND THESE TWO MEN, THEY HAVE DEPENDED COMPLETELY ON THIS JOB, AND THEY HAVE TO SELL THEIR APARTMENT, THEY HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE ALL THESE YEARS. THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO LIVE. I LIVE WITH MY NEPHEW'S WIFE, FRED LIVES WITH GAY COPS --
STEPHEN: REAL GAY COPS OR VILLAGE PEOPLE GAY COPS?
REAL GAY COPS. THEY EXIST.
STEPHEN: I WOULDN'T KNOW. IT'S PROBABLY A GREAT MOVIE, BUT I'M NOT INTO THAT SCENE.
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. BECAUSE GAY MARRIAGE IS A HUGE HOT BUTTON FRONT PAGE SSUE.
STEPHEN: ABSOLUTELY, IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR ME TO  OPPOSE IT AND STILL GET INVITED TO NICE PARTIES (LAUGHTER)
THIS MOVIE PUTS A FACE ON THIS ENTIRE ISSUE. YOU WILL LOVE THIS FILM.
STEPHEN: I KNOW! THAT'S WHY I'M AFRAID TO GO SEE IT! I LOVE YOU, I LOVE ALFRED MOLINA, IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY STORY, BUT THEN I'M GOING TO LOVE THE IDEA OF MEN LOVING. YOU WILL ERODE THE BARRIERS, THE BULWARKS I HAVE BETWEEN ME AND ACCEPTING GAY MARRIAGE AS NORMAL.
PERHAPS SO. WE'LL CORRUPT YOU FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: SHOW HIM THE CLIP. THIS IS YOU AND ALFRED MOLINA YOU GUYS NEW IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
ARE YOU KIDDING? RIGHT HERE IN THIS BAR WE CHALLENGED THE NEW YORK STATE REGULATIONS THAT PROHIBITED BARS FROM SERVING HOMOSEXUALS.
YEAH, WE HAVE THE CLIPPING FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 1966. ME AND FOUR OTHER GUYS CAME IN HERE ACCOMPANIED BY FIVE REPORTERS. WHEN WE WERE DENIED SERVICE WE DENOUNCED THE STATE LIQUOR AUTHORITY.
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE THAT GUY? YEAH I WAS ONE OF THE GUYS. WOW! THIS ROUND'S ON ME, FELLAS. (LAUGHTER) YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR!
STEPHEN: I'M GONNA TRY THAT. YOU'RE MARRIED. YOU'RE A STRAIGHT GUY, RIGHT?
I AM MARRIED AND I AM A STRAIGHT GUY.
STEPHEN: IS IT HARD TO PLAY A GAY MAN? LIKE, WHAT'S THE PREPARATION? WHAT'S THE CHARACTER STUDY HERE? BECAUSE, LISTEN, I'M STRAIGHT, I'M AS STRAIGHT AS THEY COME. I MEAN, IT IS IN MY BONES, BUDDY, OKAY?
YEAH.
STEPHEN: SO I CAN'T IMAGINE DESIRING A MAN.
STEPHEN, THE ONLY HARD PARTS TO PLAY ARE BADLY WRITTEN PARTS, THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. THESE ARE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN PARTS. NO RESEARCH INVOLVED. IT'S SIMPLY THERE. THESE ARE -- YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE NOTION OF "PLAYING GAY," IT'S SIMPLY PLAYING A HUMAN BEING.
STEPHEN: IN THE MOVIE, YOU'RE -- (AUDIENCE REACTS) I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU IN THE MOVIE AND YOU NOW.
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.
STEPHEN: ARE YOU IN CHARACTER AS GAY MAN RIGHT NOW?
NO, I'M NOT ACTING AT THE MOMENT, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, IF I WERE TO PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE SERIES OF STEREOTYPICAL MANNERISMS, MINCING LIMP WRISTS, NELLIE MANNERISMS, IT WOULD BE AN INSINCERE PERFORMANCE. IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF INHABITING THE CHARACTER. I WAS BLESSED BY ACTING WITH FRED MOLINA.
STEPHEN: WHO IS HISPANIC. HE IS HISPANIC I THINK ETHNICALLY HE HAS A SPANISH FATHER AND AN ITALIAN MOTHER AND GREW UP IN ENGLAND.
STEPHEN: DID YOU MARRY HIM SO YOU COULD STAY IN THE COUNTRY? (LAUGHTER) I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT'S THE POLITICAL ANGLE HERE?
FRED IS VERY MUCH AN AMERICAN STRAIGHT MAN FROM ENGLAND PLAYING A GAY LOVER OF MINE OF 40 YEARS.
STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT. HAVE YOU GOT IT STRAIGHT?
STEPHEN: I'VE GOT IT GAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. YOU'RE TWO OLD MEN IN THIS WHO I ASSUME HAVE A HEALTHY ATTRACTION FOR EACH OTHER. IS THERE ANY HARD CORE NAPPING GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE?
THERE'S A LITTLE SNUGGLING. NOTHING RESEMBLING SEX. MAYBE THERE WAS YEARS AGO. THIS IS A COMFORTABLE OLD COUPLE. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE PEOPLE OF MY AGE MAKING LOVE IN A FILM, STRAIGHT OR GAY. (LAUGHTER)
STEPHEN: WELL, I DON'T KNOW -- JOHN, SEND ME SOME TAPES. (LAUGHTER) JOHN LITHGOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH! JOHN LITHGOW, "LOVE IS STRANGE." BUT HE IS NOT. IT'S IN THEATERS NOW. GO SEE IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
