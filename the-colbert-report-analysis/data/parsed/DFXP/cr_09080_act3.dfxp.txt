Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AUTHOR  WHOSE NEW BOOK PRAISING  HUMANISM. TALK ABOUT PANDERING. PLEASE WELCOME, A.C. GRAYLING! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOOM! PROFESSOR GRAYLING GOOD TO SEE  YOU AGAIN. NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.
NICE BE BACK.
Stephen: YOU ARE A  PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY, MASTER  OF NEW COLLEGE OF THE HUMANITIES  LONDON. YOU HAVE WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS  INCLUDING "THE GOOD BOOK THE  HUMANIST BIBLE."  YOU WERE HERE FOR THAT LAST  TIGHT. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE  GOD ARGUMENT THE CASE AGAINST  RELIGION AND FOR HUMANISM." WHAT SP HUMANISM? IS THAT LIKE VEGANISM? BECAUSE I DON'T GO DOWN WITH CAN  BALLS BECAUSE I AM DELICIOUS. WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S AN ATTITUDE ABOUT HOW WE  LIVE A MORAL LIFE. IT'S ABOUT WHERE YOU START.
Stephen: IT'S RELIGION.
NO, NO.
Stephen: HOW YOU LIVE THE  MORAL LIFE. WE HAVE THE LAWS FROM GOD, OBEY  THEM. END OF STORY. THERE'S AN OLDER AND RICHER VIEW  WHICH STEMS FROM THE GREEK  PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY, WE HUMAN BEINGS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR  THINKING ABOUT OUR -- NOT A SET  OF LAWS OR A CODE. WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY  FOR OURSELVES NOT ABOUT HOW  WE'RE GOING TO LIVE A GOOD LIFE BUT HOW TO RELATE WELL TO OTHER  PEOPLE. IT'S REALLY WHAT HUMANISM IS ALL  ABOUT.
Stephen: BUT HOW CAN YOU  LIVE GOOD AND FLOURISHING LIVES  IF YOU DID NOT HAVE OBJECTIVE STANDARDS OF MORALITY. NOW WITH THE TEN COMMANDMENTS I  WOULD BE SACRIFICING YOU RIGHT  NOW. SERIOUSLY TEMPTED. THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE GOD. EVEN THE HUMANISM SIN FORMED BY  THE EARLIEST LAWS GIVEN TO US BY  GOD. IT'S A LONG STORY.
Stephen: I HAVE ALL THE  TIME IN THE WORLD, BUDDY. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE POINT ABOUT THE  OBJECTIVITY IT'S AN IMPORTANT  POINT THIS ONE. IT ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT  WE'RE SOCIAL CREATURES, HUMAN  BEINGS. WE NEED ONE ANOTHER. WE NEED RELATIONSHIPS. WE NEED TO LOVE PEOPLE AND BE  LOVED BY THEM IN RETURN. WE NEED FRIENDSHIPS AND  COOPERATE WITH PEOPLE. THIS IS A CONSTRAINT ON�� JUST  WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH OTHER  PEOPLE.
Stephen: HOW DO WE MAKE OUR  MORAL DECISIONS OUR DECISION AS  TO WHAT IS BEST FOR US SOCIETY? IS IT THE GREATEST GOOD FOR  EVERYBODY? THAT'S ONE VIEW, THE IEW TILL  TAIRN VIEW. IT ALL STARTS FROM AN  INTERESTING QUESTION THAT SEW  CRATES ASKED HIS FELLOW --
Stephen: THAT GUY WAS A  PERVERT. HE WAS PUT TO DEATH FOR  CORRUPTING YOUTH OF ATHENS.
YES.
Stephen: IT MUST HAVE BEEN  PRETTY MESSED UP BECAUSE THE  GREEKS ARE DOWN WITH ALL THAT. THAT'S YOUR HERO GEORGE AAHEAD. JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT MORAL  GROUND YOU ARE ON. GO AHEAD.
HIS CRIME WAS ASKING PEOPLE  TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES NOT TO  ACCEPT WISDOM OR HANDED DOWN  WISDOM. HE ASKED PEOPLE WHAT KIND OF  PEOPLE SHOULD WE BE? WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY SHOULD WE  CONSTRUCT SO EACH ONE OF US CAN  LIVE A LIFE WORTH LIVING.
Stephen: BASED ON REASON  AND LOGIC. YOU HAVE GUYS DOING STUFF ON  REASON AND LOGIC. GUYS WHO REJECTED GOD, LENNON,  STALIN AND MAO. THEY RACKED UP BODY COUNTS WAY  BIGGER THAN ANY RELIGION IN THE  CENTURY. THAT'S YOUR IDEA OF HOW TO BE  GOVERNED?
I'M AFRAID NOT.
Stephen: THEY REJECTED GOD  AND EMBRACES REASON.
BUT THEY DIDN'T RUN THEIR  COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY REJECTED�r  GOD. THEY RAN THEIR COUNTRIES BECAUSE  THEY THOUGHT AS OTHERS HAVE DONE  IN THE PAST THAT THEY HAD THE ONE GREAT TRUTH, THE ONE RIGHT  WAY TO LIVE AND EVERYBODY MUST  ACCEPT IT.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT YOUR  ARGUMENT THAT AC IS RIGHT AND  GOD IS WRONG COX GOD BE -- COULD GOD BE? IS IT POSSIBLE THERE'S A GOD?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: SOUR RIGHT.
I'M TRYING TO BE RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU COULD BE�i  WRONG?
I COULD BE WRONG.
Stephen: SO THERE COULD BE  A GOD? THERE.
COULD BE MANY GODS.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE ONE OR  NOW. I DON'T WANT TO BE GREEDY. YOU ADMIT YOU COULD BE WRONG. WE'LL TAKE PASCHAL'S ARGUMENT. IF YOU ARE WRONG YOU GO TO HELL. IF YOU ARE RIGHT YOU GO NOWHERE  WHERE YOU DIE.
IF IF THERE'S A HELL IT'S  GOING TO BE FULL OF INTERESTING  PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: IT'S HARD TO TALK  WITH A PITCH FORK IN YOUR MOUTH  THOUGH. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU THINK RELIG JOHN A NET  POSITIVE OR A NEGATIVE? DO YOU THINK IT DOES MORE HARM  OR MORE GOOD?
MUCH MORE HARM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SO IF IT DOES MORE  HARM THAN GOOD, ISN'T IT LOGICAL  AS A SOCIETY THAT WE DECIDE TO OUTLAW RELIGION.
I DON'T THINK SO.
Stephen: WHY NOT, IT DOES  HARM?
IT DOES HARM.
Stephen: IS IT LOGICAL TO  GET RID OF IT?
ALCOHOL DOES HARM BUT WE HAD  A BAD TIME OUTLAWING THAT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK  THERE'S A BOOTLEG GOD OUT THERE?
THERE ALWAYS WILL BE.
Stephen: IF IT DOES GET�i  OUTLAWED PLEASE HIDE ME. AC GRAYLING, THE GOD ARGUMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLA
