Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW -- I KNOW THE WORLD'S A COMPLICATED PLACE AND I'M NO SCIENTIST, BUT I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT INTO ALL THE ALARMISM ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. WHY FEAR CHANGE? MAYBE EARTH IS JUST GOING THROUGH PUBERTY. OUR GLACIERS ARE DROPPING. JUNGLES CROPPING UP IN STRANGE PLACES AND SHE SOMETIMES WE WAKE UP AND FIND OUR STREETS ALL WET. IT'S NATURAL. BUT IT TURNS OUT-- AND I DIDN'T KNOW THIS-- HUMANS AREN'T THE ONLY CREATURES ON THE PLANET.
CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECT NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. THE NATIONAL AUDOBON SOCIETY SAID HALF OF OUR CONTINENT'S 650 SPECIES WILL BE FORCED TO FIND NEW PLACES TO LIVE, FEED, AND BREED OVER THE NEXT 65 YEARS.
Stephen:  FOLKS, THESE ARE THE SCARE TACTICS FROM THE LOON-LOVING LOONS FROM THE AUDOBON SOCIETY. THE STUDY'S AUTHOR ACTUALLY NAMES ONE BIRD THAT WILL THRIVE  AS THE EARTH WARMS, QUOTE --  "YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE SOUNDS LIKE? IT'S THE SOUNDAVE MOURNING DOVE." YES. THE HAUNTING CALL OF THE MOURNING DOVE REMINDS US OF ALL WE'VE LOST. LET ME GUESS. THE OTHER SURVIVING SPECIES WILL BE THE NORTHERN GUILT-TRIP SPARROW. AND THE I TOLD YOU SONGBIRD.
I TOLD YOU SO. I TOLD YOU SO.
Stephen:  BUT SADLY, OFFICIAL STATE BIRDS LIKE LOUISIANA BROWN PELICAN, VERMONT'S HERMIT THRUSH, AND NEW HAMPSHIRE'S PURPLE FINCH WILL BE PUSHED OUT OF THEIR STATES COMPLETELY. SUDDENLY THE HUNDREDS OF HOURS I SPENT MEMORIZING STATE TRIVIA SEEMS LIKE A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. BY THE WAY-- A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME? THE OFFICIAL STATE MOTTO OF DELAWARE. STILL GOT IT.   ( APPLAUSE ) AND WORSE, AND WORSE THE STUDY SAYS THAT THE STATE BIRD OF AMERICA, THE BALD EAGLE, MIGHT HAVE ITS HABITAT DECREASED 75% BY 2080. HOW CAN THAT BE? I THOUGHT ITS NATIVE TERRITORY WAS DISCOUNT PATRIOTIC T-SHIRTS. AND BASED ON THE SIZE WHAT I'VE SEEN AT WAL-MART, THAT TERRITORY IS EXPANDING. FOLKS, THE INI HAVE ROW-NUTS DEMAND ENERGY SOURCES TO SAVE THE BIRDS, NEW SOURCES. BUT WHO'S GOING TO SAVE THE BIRDS FROM OUR NEW ENERGY SOURCES? WOULD THE AUDOBON VOT PREFER WIND POWER.
WIND FARMS I CAN MORE THAN 100,000 BIRDS EACH YEAR.
IT'S PITTING GLOBAL WARMING ENVIRONMENTALISTS AGAINST THE BIRD LOVERS AND WILDFIRE CONSERVATION. WHY? BECAUSE WIND FARMS ARE KILLING MORE THAN 1,000 BIRDS A DAY. MANY ARE PROTECTED OR MIGRATORY SPECIES.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT, YOUR BELOVED WIND FARMS ARE JUST HIGH-RISE CUISINARTS. OH, OH, AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR SPRESHES SOLAR ENERGY?
A NEW CONTROVERSY OVER SOLAR POWER IS LITEREALLY FLARING UP. BIRDS ARE GETTING IGNITED IN MIDFLIGHT AND FALLING FROM THE SKY.
THE HEATING PRODUCES UP TO 900 DEGREES IS CHARRING THE FEATHERS OF BIRDS FLYING THROUGH, OFTEN CAUSING THEM TO CRASH AND DIE.
Stephen:  HERE'S AN IDEA-- PUT THE SOLAR PANELS NEXT TO THE WIND TURBINES AND LET IT RAIN SPARROW McNUGGETS. JUST HAVE A POND FULL OF HONE MUSTARD FOR THEM TO FALL INTO. WILL THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY? I'M SORRY, BIRD LOVERS AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE AMERICA HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HAVING BIRDS AND LIGHTBULBS. I'M SORRY, I CHOOSE LIGHTBULBS BECAUSE I NEED THEM TO READ MY AUDOBON GUIDE. THE BIRDS ARE SO PRETTY. BUT I WILL SAY ONE THING-- AS OUR PLANET WARMS, AMERICA WILL NEED A NEW NATIONAL BIRD. SO I HEREBY NOMINATE THE MAJESTIC, FRIDGIDARE 12000 B.T.U. WINDO AIR CONDITIONER, WITH TEMPERATURE-SENTENCING  REMOTE CONTROL. BEHOLD HER GLORIOUS PLUMAGE AND THREE FAN SPEEDS. AND LO DOTH SHE SOAR WHEN NOT PROPERLY SECURED WITH THE INCLUDED WINDOW MOUNTING KIT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
