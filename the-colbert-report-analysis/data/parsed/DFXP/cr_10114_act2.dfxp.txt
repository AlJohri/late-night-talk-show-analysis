THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS. FOLKS, FOLKS, CHECK YOUR CALENDARS BECAUSE YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THE 2016 ELECTION IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND I AM FULL OF QUESTIONS. WHO WILL RUN? WHO WILL THE PARTIES NOMINATE? SHOULD I HAVE SAID WHOM WILL THEY NOMINATE? WHEN DOES ONE USE THE OBJECTIVE PRONOUN FORM OF "WHO?" HAVE I GOTTEN OFF TOPIC? OF COURSE, THE QUESTION KARL ROVE WANTS EVERYONE ASKING IS WHETHER DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON IS TOO OLD AND INFIRM TO BE PRESIDENT.
KARL ROVE SUGGESTED HILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE.
LOOK, SHE'LL BE 69 BY THE TIME OF THE 2016 ELECTION. SHE WILL BE 77 IF SHE SERVES TWO TERMS.
Stephen:  LET ME CHECK THE MATH THERE. OKAY, YEAH, OKAY, I HAVE 69 STRAWS IN ONE HAND, AND LET ME GET-- LET ME GET EIGHT MORE STRAWS. YEAH, YEAH, THAT REALLY FEELS LIKE  I'M GRASPING AT A LOT OF STRAWS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY, ONE EAGLE-EYED JOURNALIST CAST FURTHER DOUBTS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S ADVANCED DECREPITUDE.
HILLARY CLINTON'S RECENT COVER SHOOT FOR PEOPLE MAGAZINE IS RAISING A LOT OF EYEBROWS.
DRUDGE REPORT TWEETED, "IS CLINTON HOLDING A WALKER?"
Stephen:  THAT'S A FAIR AND REASONABLE QUESTION. I DO NOT DOUBT FOR A SECOND THAT IF HILLARY CLINTON USED A WALKER, SHE'D INSIST ON APPEARING WITH IT ON THE COVER OF "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE. NO SURPRISE, FOLKS, THE HILLARY HUGGERS AT PEOPLE FLEW INTO DAMAGE CONTROL RELEASING THIS STATEMENT. "SECRETARY CLINTON IS STANDING NEXT TO A PATIO CHAIR. OF AS DOCTORS CALL IT A STATIONERY POOL-SIDE JAZZY. AND DRUDGE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THAT RIGHT BESIDE CLINTON RIGHT THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ALICE FROM THE "BRADY BUNCH" DIED. COINCIDENCE? OR DID HILLARY CLINTON BEAT HER TO DEATH WITH HER WALKER? ( APPLAUSE ).   ( CHEERS ) I DON'T KNOW WHY CLINTON SAT FOR THESE GERIATRIC PHOTOS. SHE SHOULD FOLLOW REAGAN'S EXAMPLE AND ONLY POSE FOR YOUTHFUL SHOTS LIKE THIS ONE. NO, JIMMY. I SAID THE SHOT OF RONALD REAGAN, NOT JUSTIN BIEBER. WHAT? THAT'S HIM? OH, ICY FRESH, GIPP-DOG. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THEY  CALLED HIM. THE POINT IS, FOLKS, THIS PEOPLE ISSUE IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING FOR CLINTON. I JUST CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HOW CONSERVATIVES REACT TO HER LATEST PRESS CONFERENCE. OH, MY GOD. SHE'S STILL GOING TO WIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
