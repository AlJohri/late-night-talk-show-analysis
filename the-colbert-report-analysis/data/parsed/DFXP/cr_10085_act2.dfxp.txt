Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW, I LOVE  SILICON VALLEY. IT'S AN  INNOVATIVE TECH UTOPIA WHERE YOU CAN SEAMLESS YOUR DINNER, WRITE  ON YOUR GLASS FROM INSIDE YOUR  UBER, WHILE IGNORING THE HOBO WHO'S DOWNLOADING ON TO A  WALL. I WAS DISTURBED TO LEARN THAT  MANY OF TECHS BRIGHTEST MINDS  ARE FOCUSING ON THE PAST.
THERE'S A PLASTIC SURGERY  BOOM, NOW SILICON VALLEY IS  PLACING A HUGE PREMIUM ON  YOUTH, AND IT HAS MEN OVER 30  TURNING TO DOCTORS TO KEEP  THEM YOUNG.
BASICALLY, IF YOU HIT 30,  YOU'RE NO GOOD FOR ANY OF  THESE TECH COMPANIES.
Stephen: YES. WHAT YOU WANT IS SOMEBODY WHO  IS DROPPED OFF BY THEIR  PARENTS AND THEN ASKS YOU TO  BUY THEM BEER. BUT HOW CAN INVESTORS TELL THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EMPTY  32-YEAR-OLD HUSK, AND SOMEONE  WITH A FUTURE. FOR ALL WE KNOW, THIS GUY IS A  SENIOR CITIZEN WITH CHEEK  IMPLANTS AND A HOODY THROWN ON  TO A HOUSE COAT. HAVE YOU EVER MET ANYONE UNDER  70 NAMED MARK ZUCKERBERG. AND THIS AFFECTS ME  PERSONALLY. I WAS IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR  OF TUMBLER, RAPTR, FLICKR, AND  HARVSTR, WHICH SCOURS THE INTERNET COLLECTING  OTHER START-UPS FOR E RESALE. NOW LUCKILY, I'VE GOT  EXCELLENT YOUTHDAR, AND I'VE  GOT A PITCH RIGHT NOW WITH A  YOUNG GENIUS, WHO HAS  SILICON VALLEY'S NEXT  BILLION DOLLAR IDEA. GLEN, GET OUT HERE. [ APPLAUSE ] GOOD TO SEE YOU. HASHTAG HELLO, STEPHEN. WE'RE DOING YOUTH SPEAK.
HELLO.0, AND @MIDNIGHT BACK  TO YOU, GLEN. I CAN TELL BY   THAT HIP FACIAL HAIR AND RAZOR SCOOTER THAT YOU ARE SUPER  YOUNG, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE  YOU HAVEN'T HAD PLASTIC  SURGERY JUST TO TRICK ME. NAME A COOL BAND I'VE NEVER  HEARD OF.
DO YOU KNOW AMPERSAN CRUSH. HELIO BARN? HOW ABOUT RUBY, DONKEY DONKEY  DONKEY.
Stephen: THREE DONKEYS? I NEVER HEARD OF THAT. OKAY, YOU'RE YOUNG. WHAT DISRUPTIVE DIGITAL  BREAKTHROUGH HAVE YOU COOKED  UP IN THAT MILLENNIAL BRAIN OF  YOURS.
HOLD ON TO YOUR ECIGARRETTE INTRODUCING SNAP SHIRT. IT KEEPS YOUR COLLAR STRAIGHT  WHILE STREAMING DATA TO YOUR  SMART PHONE ABOUT HOW YOUR  COLLAR ISN'T BENDING.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY. I'M INTRIGUED. HOW IS IT MONETIZED?
LET'S SAY BIT COIN.
Stephen: I'VE HEARD OF  THAT. I'VE HEARD OF THAT. SO WHAT'S YOUR ROLL OUT PLAN  WE'RE GOING TO POST IT  ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA FROM  CHRISTIAN MINGLE TO THE ELK  LODGE.
Stephen: SOLD, SOLD. HERE'S $10 MILLION. [APPLAUSE] THANKS BRO, SEE YOU IN URBAN  OUTFITTERS. GLEN, EVERYBODY. I'M GOING TO BE RICH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
