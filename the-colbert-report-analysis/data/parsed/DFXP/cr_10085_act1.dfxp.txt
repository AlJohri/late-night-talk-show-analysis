Stephen: WELCOME, GOOD TO  HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: ANYBODY OUT THERE  WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THAT I'M A  WELL KNOWN OUTDOORSMAN. I'M OUT THERE TWICE A DAY. AND OF COURSE, I LOVE MOTHER  EARTH. JUST LIKE THE WISE NATIVE  AMERICANS WITH THE BUFFALO. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD  EXPLOIT EVERY PART OF THE  PLANET. THERE'S STILL A COUPLE OF  ANIMALS I HAVEN'T WORN AS SHOE  YET. I'M JUST SAYING MEERKATS WOULD MAKE GREAT COMFORT  INSOLES. BUT NOW THE GLOBAL WARMING  WHINERS AT THE U.N. RELEASED A  REPORT THAT WILL RAISE THE   URINE LEVELS IN YOUR PANTS. DIRE WARNING. THE PREDICTION THAT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD  DESTABILIZE HUMAN SOCIETY.
A NEW UNITED NATIONS REPORT  RAISED THE THREAT OF CLIMATE  CHANGE TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
SCIENTISTS SAY WE'RE  RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
FOOD AND WATER SHORTAGES. FLOODS, DROUGHTS. WILDFIRES AND  CYCLONES.
DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER MASS HYSTERIA THANK YOU, DOCTOR VENKMAN
Stephen: THE REPORT CLAIMS  THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE SO BAD  THEY ADDED A NEW LEVEL OF RISK  THEIR DANGER CHART. THE HIGH COLOR BLAZING RED NOW  GOES TO VERY HIGH COLOR  PURPLE. OBVIOUSLY HIGH WASN'T ACTUALLY  THAT HIGH. SO WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THAT  VERY HIGH IS HIGH. CALL ME WHEN IT REACHES  ULTRAVIOLET. AND YES THE HUMAN EYE CAN'T  SEE THAT. BUT WE'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION  ANYWAY. AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO A MUCH  MORE OPTIMISTIC STUDY PUT OUT  BY MY FAVORITE ENVIRONMENTAL  GROUP, EXXON MOBIL. IN A REPORT TO  SHAREHOLDERS RELEASED THE  EXACT SAME DAY AS THE U.N.  REPORT, EXXON ACKNOWLEDGED THE  NEED TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BUT CONCLUDED THE GOVERNMENTS  ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO ADOPT  POLICY THAT IS CUT EMISSIONS. EXXON KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, BECAUSE THE COMPANY  CONTRIBUTES $20 MILLION A YEAR  TO THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM  INSTITUTE WHICH LOBBIES  AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE  LEGISLATION. YOU SEE, THE GOVERNMENT IN  ACTION INCREASES EXXON SHARE  PRICE. EXXON THEN USES THAT MONEY TO  INFLUENCE POLITICIANS. IT'S A PHENOMENON CALLED THE  GREEN HOUSE EFFECT. [LAUGHTER]  [APPLAUSE]
Stephen: ALSO, THE GREEN  SENATE EFFECT. THEY SPREAD IT AROUND. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I LOVE  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. IT SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT  WE AS A SOCIETY THINK IT'S  DEPRAVED TO TAKE A HUMAN  LIFE, AND TO PROVE IT, WE'RE  GOING TO KILL YOU. THAT'S WHY I WAS SWOLLEN WITH  PRIDE WHEN I SAW THIS FROM THE  CHATTANOOGA FREE PRESS. TENNESSEE IS SEEKING EXECUTION  DATES FOR 10 DEATH ROW  INMATES. IT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE FOR  A STATE THAT'S EXECUTED ONLY  SIX INMATES SINCE 1960. ONE OFFICIAL SAYS THEY'VE  NEVER SEEN 10 EXECUTION DATES  ALL AT ONCE.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO DO  10 AT ONCE. THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE FREE  SUB.
TENNESSEE HAD TO HALT ALL  EXECUTIONS IN 2011, BECAUSE  THE ITALIAN CHEMICAL COMPANY  THAT MADE THEIR LETHAL DRUG OF  CHOICE. SODIUM PENTOBARBITAL STOPPED  PRODUCING IT AFTER TENNESSEE  COULDN'T GUARANTEE IT WOULDN'T  BE USED FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID IT WOULD  ONLY BE USED AS AN INCREDIBLY  EFFECTIVE COUGH SUPPRESSANT. AND THE SCARCITY OF LETHAL  INJECTION DRUGS HAS FORCED STATES TO SCRAMBLE FOR SUBSTITUTES. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF  HALF AND HALF AND HAVE TO PUT  SKIM IN YOUR COFFEE. JUST KILL ME NOW. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: A LOT OF DEATH  PENALTY FANS IN THE AUDIENCE  TONIGHT. THESE SUBSTITUTE DRUGS HAVE  MADE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT SEEM  UNUSUALLY CRUEL. AFTER A KNOW AN OKLAHOMA  INMATE WAS INJECTED HIS FINAL  WORDS I FEEL MY WHOLE BODY  BURNING. BIG DEAL, I YELL THAT ALL THE  TIME IN HOT YOGA. AND DURING AN OHIO EXECUTION  IN JANUARY, THE PRISONER MADE  SNORTING AND CHOKING SOUNDS FOR 10 MINUTES AND TOOK  25 MINUTES TO DIE,  WHICH IS PARTICULARLY  DISTURBING BECAUSE A LOT OF  THESE EXECUTIONS DON'T START  UNTIL MIDNIGHT, AND HELLO,  SOME OF US HAVE TO GET UP IN  THE MORNING. FORTUNATELY, TENNESSEE HAS  FOUND A WAY AROUND THE PUBLIC  LETHAL INJECTIONS, AND IT'S  THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S WORD [APPLAUSE] FOLKS, THESE BOTCHED LETHAL  INJECTIONS ALL SHARE ONE  FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THE PUBLIC  HEARD ABOUT THEM. BUT A NEW LAW IN TENNESSEE  ALLOWS THE STATE TO WITHHOLD  ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION FROM  THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING THE TYPE  OF DRUGS THAT THEY PLAN TO  USE. YOU SEE, IF THEY KEEP IT  SECRET, THEY COULD USE  ANYTHING. SODIUM PENTOBARBITAL, SODIUM  AND BARBOSOL. DIET COKE AND MENTOS. THE CINNAMON CHALLENGE. THE NEW LAW ALSO ALLOWS  TENNESSEE TO NEVER DISCLOSE  WHO THE DRUG MANUFACTURER IS,  WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT,  BECAUSE THE NEW DRUG THEY WANT  TO USE, SODIUM PENTOBARBITAL,  IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM ANY  LEGAL DRUG MANUFACTURER. AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO  GET QUALITY PRODUCT WHEN THE  SLOGAN IS, DON'T TELL ANYONE  WHERE YOU GOT THIS. BUT NO WORRIES, FOLKS. [ APPLAUSE ] NO WORRIES. BECAUSE A SPOKESPERSON FOR THE  TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF  CORRECTIONS SAYS WE ARE  CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO  SECURE THE DRUG WHEN  NECESSARY. YES, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET  THE DRUG, EITHER FROM A  REPUTABLE LICENSED PHARMACIST  OR FROM A GUY LOITERING UNDER  THE OVERPASS. OF COURSE, SOME OUTSIDE  AGITATORS CALLED "THE PEOPLE  THEY'RE GOING TO EXECUTE" ARE  DEMANDING TO KNOW WHAT'S BEING  INJECTED INTO THEM. YOU SEE, ACCORDING TO THEIR  LAWYERS, THE PEOPLE HAVE A  RIGHT TO KNOW THE DEPARTMENT  OF CORRECTIONS ISN'T TORTURING  CITIZENS USING PUBLIC FUNDS. RIGHT. BECAUSE THAT'S THE CIA'S JOB. [ APPLAUSE ] WELL, THE PUBLIC EVENTUALLY  MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW,  BUT WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHT OF I'D  RATHER NOT KNOW. NOW FORTUNATELY, TENNESSEE'S  LAW ALSO MAKE ITS IMPOSSIBLE  TO KNOW EXACTLY WHO WILL CARRY  OUT THE EXECUTIONS. OH, OH, THAT MAKES CAPITAL  PUNISHMENT INTO A FUN GAME OF  WHODUNIT
AND IT'S GREAT, BECAUSE  AMERICANS SUPPORT THE DEATH  PENALTY, BUT DON'T WANT TO  KNOW HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE. BY THE WAY, UNTIL WE KNOW HOW  THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE, I'D  STAY AWAY FROM TENNESSEE  SAUSAGE. [APPLAUSE] THE STORY ABOUT SECRECY OF  EXECUTION IS NOTHING KNEW, ONE  OF THE TENNESSEE LAWYERS  ARGUED THE STATE'S INTEREST IN  KEEPING IT SECRET IS SETTLED. THE PROCESS OF WEARING HOODS AT EXECUTIONS  HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE  MIDDLE AGES. TENNESSEE JUST WANTS TO TAKE  THE SYSTEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE  AGES. BUT EVEN WITH ALL THE SECRECY [APPLAUSE]
Stephen: THERE IS STILL  SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE  UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT STRAPPING  A GUY TO A TABLE AND WATCHING  HIM DIE. THE GUY ON THE TABLE. WHY DO WE HAVE TO KNOW WHO HE  IS, IT PUTS A HUMAN FACE ON  HUMANS WITH FACES. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TELL US  THEY CAUGHT A BAD GUY, AND  MADE SURE HE WAS BAD WITH A  JUDGE OR WHATEVER, AND ONCE  JUSTICE IS SERVED, PUT HIM UP  ON A SCOREBOARD OUTSIDE THE  PRISON. OR BETTER YET, JUST KEEP  EXECUTING PEOPLE THE WAY WE DO  NOW, BUT INSTEAD OF  BLINDFOLDING THE PRISONER,  BLIND FOLD THE PUBLIC, AND  THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
