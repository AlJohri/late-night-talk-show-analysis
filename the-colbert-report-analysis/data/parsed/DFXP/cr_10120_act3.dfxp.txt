Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE LEGAL TEAM WHO FOUGHT TO STRIKE DOWN CALIFORNIA'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN. GREAT, NOW SAN FRANCISCO WILL SEEM TOTALLY GAY. PLEASE WELCOME DAVID BOIES AND TED OLSON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] GOOD TO SEE YOU. MR. OLSON. MR. BOIES, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. DAVID, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK. TED, WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU ON FOR THE FIRST TIME. I WANTED TO HAVE YOU ON FOR A LONG TIME NOW.
GLAD TO BE HERE FINALLY.
Stephen: PLEASURE. NOW YOU TWO, I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU TWO GENTLEMEN. YOUR FREE RIDE IS OVER ON THIS GAY ISSUE, OK? BUT FIRST TELL THE PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE. LET'S SEE, DAVID BOIES, THEODORE OLSON, PROMINENT LAWYERS IN THE COUNTRY. YOU'VE ARGUED OVER 70 CASES BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES V. MICROSOFT, THE CITIZENS UNITED CASE, BUSH V. GORE AND ON OPPOSITE SIDES. YOU'RE TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED A LIBERAL. YOU'RE CONSIDERED A CONSERVATIVE. NOW, YOU TWO HAVE GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "REDEEMING THE DREAM: THE CASE FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY." THIS DESCRIBES THE BATTLE TO GET MARRIAGE EQUALITY ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, BUT FOR YOU GUYS SPECIFICALLY THE PROP 8 CASE WAS THE LINCHPIN.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: HOW CAN THE TWO OF YOU BE FRIENDS? [LAUGHTER] YOU FOUGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF BUSH V. GORE. ALL RIGHT. YOU FOUGHT FOR GORE. YOU FOUGHT FOR BUSH.
AND HE ACCEPTED THE OUTCOME GRACIOUSLY.
I'M A VERY FORGIVING PERSON.
Stephen: I GOT A QUESTION ON THAT ONE. BUSH V. GORE: GREAT SUPREME COURT DECISION OR THE GREATEST SUPREME COURT DECISION? TED, I'LL LET YOU ANSWER. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, THE SUPREME COURT DECIDES IT, AND THEY DECIDED THAT BUSH WON THAT CASE AND WON THAT ELECTION. AND I THINK IT WAS A VERY SOLID DECISION. OF COURSE, I MAY BE A LITTLE BIT BIASED, BUT I THINK DAVID AGREES ACTUALLY.
Stephen: I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR HIS ANSWER, BUT...
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE COURT SAID. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YOU CAME TOGETHER TO FIGHT FOR GAY OR SAME-SEX MARRIAGE RIGHTS. AND YOU'VE WON EVERY CASE SO FAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHAT IS SO COMPELLING ABOUT YOUR ARGUMENT THAT YOU WOULD COME TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO FIGHT FOR THIS?
THE THING THAT INFLUENCED DAVID AND ME THE MOST I THINK IS THAT WE'RE IN A COUNTRY DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COWORKERS, WE'RE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM. WE'RE TELLING THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT ENTITLED TO BE TREATED THE SAME AND TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES AND DISADVANTAGES.
Stephen: WE TREAT THEM THE SAME. NONE OF THEM CAN GET MARRIED TO EACH OTHER. THAT'S CALLED EQUAL PROTECTION. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT CLAUSE?
THAT'S EXACTLY...
WE WANT THEM TO BE EQUAL TO US.
Stephen: THE WHOLE REASON I GOT MARRIED WAS AS A TAUNT TO GAY PEOPLE, THAT THEY COULD NOT GET MARRIED. IT HARMS MY MARRIAGE. IT HARMS MY MARRIAGE.
EVERY STATE THIS SPREADS TO GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER TO MY HOUSE.
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY'RE ALREADY THERE. THEY'RE ALREADY LIVING NEXT TO YOUR HOUSE.
ARE YOU MAKING A LIST OF PROMINENT GAY PEOPLE?
THEY ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS. THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS. THEY ARE YOUR COWORKERS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR YOU HERE WHO WISH TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE REST OF US DO.
Stephen: BUT DOESN'T SOCIETY GET TO CREATE MORAL STANDARDS? DON'T WE AS A SOCIETY GET TO CREATE OUR OWN MORAL STANDARDS, AND HAVEN'T GAY PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, NICE PEOPLE OR NOT NICE PEOPLE, BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THEM ARE NICE, LET'S FACE IT.
THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE.
Stephen: EXCEPT THE REST OF US ARE OBEYING A WESTERN MORAL STANDARD.
WHAT'S IMMORAL ABOUT BEING MARRIED?
MARRIED TO ANOTHER GUY. WE JUST HAD A SECTION ON THE SHOW TALKING ABOUT HOW GAY  MARRIAGE IS SPREADING AND EVEN SCOTT WALKER IS UNWILLING TO   EXPRESS HIS OPINION. NOW YOU'RE ON. OKAY. THAT FITS TOGETHER LIKE A MALE SOCKET AND FEMALE SOCKET, OKAY. BUT A MALE SOCKET AND MALE SOCKET TOGETHER, NO ELECTRICITY. YOU UNDERSTAND? DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ELECTRICITY WORKS?
NOT A LOT, BUT, YOU SEE, IF IT WASN'T ELECTRICITY, THEN THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO GET MARRIED. WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN LOVE, COMMITTED COUPLES WHO HAVE BEEN TOGETHER IN SOME CASES 10, 20, 30 YEARS. PEOPLE WHO ARE RAISING FAMILIES. AND PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY WANT TO HAVE THE SAME RECOGNITION FOR THOSE UNIONS, THE SAME RECOGNITION FOR THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE RAISING THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS. ALL THEY WANT IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE SAME FAMILY VALUES, THE SAME OPENNESS, THE SAME RECOGNITION IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT EVERYBODY, GAY, STRAIGHT, BLACK, WHITE, REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, EVERYBODY WANTS THAT. THAT'S ALL THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR.
Stephen: IS THIS THE ARGUMENT BEING MADE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE CHEERING FOR. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?
THE ARGUMENT WE MADE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IS EXACTLY THAT. IN THIS COUNTRY, WE BELIEVE THAT ALL CITIZENS ARE CREATED EQUAL, THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES. THEY HAVE EQUAL RESPONSIBILITIES. AND GAY AND LESBIAN PEOPLE, WHO CONSIST OF A LARGE PART OF OUR POPULATION, ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY IN CALIFORNIA AND THE PLACES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE WE WON IN THE SUPREME COURT. TO CHANGE THE RULES IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE PERCEIVED AS SECOND-GLASS CITIZENS. THEIR RELATIONSHIPS DIDN'T COUNT. IT WAS DAMAGING TO THEM AND DAMAGING TO THEIR CHILDREN. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TRIVIAL. IT MATTERS A GREAT DEAL AND EVERYONE'S LIFE ALL OF THE TIME.
Stephen: YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE. YOU'RE A LIBERAL. THE TWO OF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL OPINIONS AND YET YOU'RE FRIENDS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL OPINIONS AND ARE STILL FRIENDS. THAT'S UNNATURAL IN AMERICA THESE DAYS. IT'S LIKE SOMEONE WHO LOVES COFFEE TOLERATING SOMEONE WHO DRINKS TEA. WHERE IS YOUR MIDDLE GROUND?
WE'RE TRYING TO START A TREND THAT WOULD REQUIRE FOR INVOLVED PEOPLE ACTUALLY LISTENING TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION, ESPECIALLY OVER FINE WINE.
Stephen: OH, NOT IN A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION OTHER FINE WINE BUT DRINKING ENOUGH THAT THE DIFFERENCES DON'T MATTER.
YES.
Stephen: DAVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. TED, THANK YOU SO MUCH. DAVID BOIES AND THEODORE OLSON, "REDEEMING THE DREAM." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
