Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, AS YOU MAY KNOW, I AM NO  FAN OF PUBLIC TELEVISION. HEY, THREE TENORS, OPERA DA  'ENGLISH. FORTUNATELY, PBS'S FEDERAL  FUNDING HAS BEEN DRYING UP TO  THE POINT THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTRIBUTION NOW MAKES UP ONLY  12% OF ITS FUNDS. WITH BUDGETS TIGHTER EVERY YEAR  CHARLIE ROSE MAY SOON HAVE STOP  BROADCASTING FROM SPACE. THAT'S WHY PBS HAS BECOME MORE  AND MORE DEPENDENT ON VIEWERS  NOTHING LIKE YOU. FOR INSTANCE, BILLIONAIRE  INDUSTRYIST DAVID KOCH WHO HAS  DONATED $23 MILLION TO PUBLIC  TELEVISION. KOCH, OF COURSE, IS THE  INFLUENTIAL CONSERVATIVE AND  EXECUTIVE OF KOCH INDUSTRIES, MAKERS OF BRAWNY PAPER TOWELS,  STAINMASTER CARPET, DIXIE CUPS  AND THANKS TO FACTORY RUN OFF SEXUALLY AMBIGUOUS TROUT. RECENTLY... GOOD LOOKING TROUT. RECENTLY PBS HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF  SCUTTLING DOCUMENTARY CALLED  CITIZEN KOCH BECAUSE THEY FEARED THE REACTION FROM DAVID KOCH. I GUESS FOR A DONATION OF $75,  YOU GET THE PBS TOTE BAG AND FOR  $23 MILLION YOU GET PBS'S NUT  SACK. BUT... BUT... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT, IT IS NICE. IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT PBS  FINALLY GETS IT. I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT  IN THE TV BIZ YOU CAN'T SAY BAD  STUFF ABOUT YOUR MEAL TICKET. THAT'S WHY I WILL NEVER REVEAL  THAT MY SPONSOR, MOUNTAIN DEW  WAS ORIGINALLY MARIO DUCCI. HE CHANGED HIS NAME IN THE  '70s AFTER HE WENT STATE'S  EVIDENCE AGAINST THE GAMBINO CRIME FAMILY AND BECAME PART OF  THE WITNESS REFRESHMENT PROGRAM. BUT I SAY IT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST  TO AVOID SAYING NASTY THINGS  ABOUT DAVID KOCH. PBS SHOULD REPLACE COOKIE  MONSTER WITH A ROLL OF BRAWNY  PAPER TOWELS. JUST AS LOVABLE AND TWICE AS  ABSORBENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
