(EAGLE CAW)
STEPHEN: TONIGHT, THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE ON NOVEMBER 4TH. OR IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, NOVEMBER 7TH! (LAUGHTER) THEN, AMERICA REACHES A MILESTONE. THOUGH IT HAD TO USE ONE OF THOSE REACHER-GRABBERS. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST, WALTER ISAACSON, HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF YOUR COMPUTER -- IT HAD TO BE YOUR HISTORY BECAUSE I ALWAYS CLEAR MINE. (LAUGHTER) NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR LAUNCHED 20 YEARS AGO TODAY, AND IT HAS JUST NOW FINISHED LOADING. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪     CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY     COMEDY CENTRAL (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. AS YOU WERE, NATION! SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU! THAT'S LOVELY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE GREETING! YOUR ADULATION IS AS WARM AND FRAGRANT AS A SPICED APPLE CIDER! I USE THAT DID METAPHOR BECAUSE IT'S AUTUMN HERE IN NEW YORK AND WHILE THE SEASON BRINGS COLORFUL FOLIAGE AND CANDY APPLES, IT'S ALSO TIME TO TAKE ON THOSE UNPLEASANT FALL CHORES -- CLEANING THE GUTTERS. WEATHER-PROOFING THE WINDOWS, AND PRETENDING YOU LIKE DECORATIVE GOURDS. (LAUGHTER) OH, HOW BEAUTIFUL, A BUTTERNUT TUMOR! (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THE MOST TEDIOUS AUTUMN CHORE OF ALL IS COVERING THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. IT'S LIKE WATCHING PEOPLE DRY. AND THIS MIDTERM THE DEMOCRATS ARE DRAWING A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND THEIR ARCH NEMESIS BARACK OBAMA. BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO POLITICO, "HARDLY ANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN THE MOST COMPETITIVE STATES WANT  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ANYWHERE NEAR THEM." SO THE POPULAR OBAMA HAS BEEN HITTING THE TRAIL INSTEAD, LIKE THIS WEEKEND IN IOWA.
I AM BEYOND THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT YOUR NEXT SENATOR FROM IOWA, OUR FRIEND, BRUCE BAILEY. YOU NEED TO ELECT BRUCE BAILEY. LEADERS LIKE BRUCE BAILEY. BRUCE BAILEY. BRUCE BAILEY. VOTE.
STEPHEN: WOW! A POWERFUL ENDORSEMENT FROM THE. FIRST LADY. IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA GET BRUCE BAILEY'S NAME OUT THERE. WHOEVER 'HE' IS. BECAUSE THE MAN RUNNING FOR SENATOR IS "BRALEY" (LAUGHTER) HONEST MISTAKE -- SHE MUST'VE MISSED THE SIGN IN FRONT OF HER. SHE WAS PROBABLY DISTRACTED BY THE 'GIANT' SIGN BEHIND HER. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, MA'AM. FOLKS, THIS JUST PROVES THAT EVEN THE FIRST LADY ISN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THE MID TERMS. BUT AS A NEWSMAN, I AM JUST AS COMMITTED TO COVERING THIS ELECTION AS MY COLLEAGUE BRETT BAIER. BRETT, KICKOFF THE MIDTERM JAMS!
WE WILL TALK ALL ABOUT THE HOT MIDTERM RACES TO WATCH AND WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE ON THE MAP DURING OUR ONLINE SHOW BEGINNING AT 7:00 EASTERN. LOG ON AT FOXNEWS.COM/SR ONLINE A LITTLE BIT LATER JUST AFTER THE SHOW.
STEPHEN: BRETT IS SO JAZZED ABOUT THE MIDTERMS HE'S, BRINGING YOU HOT, UP-TO-THE-MINUTE COVERAGE... A LITTLE BIT LATER, SOMEWHERE ON THE INTERNET. WELL, BRETT, I WILL NOT BE OUT-OBLIGATED-TO-BE-EXCITED. IT'S TIME FOR... MIDTERMS. '014: DETOUR TO GRIDLOCK -- AN EXCITING THING THAT I AM TOTALLY INTERESTED IN -- WAIT! DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL. LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF A DUCKLING FOLLOWING A CAT DRESSED LIKE A SHARK RIDING A ROOMBA!" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 014!
STEPHEN:  NATION! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NATION, THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION COULDN'T BE MORE DESCRIBABLE. REPUBLICANS ARE JUST SIX SEATS AWAY FROM GRABBING CONTROL OF THE SENATE. A MOVE THAT WOULD CHANGE THE FACE OF SENATE LEADERSHIP FROM THIS TO THIS, OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND. NOT SURE. ONE THEORETICALLY INTERESTING RACE IS IN COLORADO, WHERE THIS ACTUAL POLL SHOWS INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT MARK UDALL RUNNING IN A VIRTUAL TIE WITH REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN CORY GARDNER AND IT IS VERY UNCLEAR WHO WILL WIN. WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT ALL CHARTS IN COLORADO NOW LOOK LIKE A RECENTLY LIT JOINT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I'M ALL-IN FOR STAUNCH CONSERVATIVE CONGRESSMAN, CORY GARDNER, WHO'S COME UNDER FIRE LATELY FOR CO-SPONSORING A FEDERAL "PERSONHOOD" BILL, CURRENTLY IN CONGRESS, WHICH STATES THE RIGHT TO LIFE IS VESTED IN EACH HUMAN BEING, BEGINNING AT THE MOMENT OF FERTILIZATION OR CLONING. (LAUGHTER) TRUE, EVERY NEW LIFE DESERVES THE RIGHTS OF PERSONHOOD, EVEN IF IT'S JUST A CLONE INTENDED SOLELY AS A SOURCE OF BACKUP ORGANS. DADDY LOVES YOU, BETA STEPHEN (LAUGHTER) KEEP DOING YOUR LIVER EXERCISES! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THIS RACE -- HE'S HAPPY. THIS RACE IS CLOSE BECAUSE UDALL  HAS BUILT A SOLID ADVANTAGE AMONG WOMEN VOTERS. IN PART BECAUSE GARDNER'S BILL COULD OUTLAW SOME FORMS OF BIRTH CONTROL. OKAY, LADIES -- GARDNER'S NAME IS ON THAT "FEDERAL" PERSONHOOD BILL IN CONGRESS, BUT HE HAS A SIMPLE ANSWER TO YOUR CONCERNS.
REPORTER: IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THE PERSONHOOD INITIATIVE, WHY KEEP YOUR NAME ON THAT "LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION ACT" ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL?
GARDNER: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FEDERAL PERSONHOOD BILL.
REPORTER: BUT THE FACTS ARE
GARDNER: THE FACTS ARE, ELI, THAT THERE IS NO FEDERAL PERSONHOOD BILL. THERE IS NO  FEDERAL PERSONHOOD BILL.
STEPHEN: OKAY? THERE IS NO FEDERAL PERSONHOOD BILL. IT'S SETTLED! THIS BILL THAT GARDNER CO-SPONSORED DOESN'T EXIST! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEXT UP, FOLKS, SOUTH DAKOTA. UP UNTIL NOW, SOUTH DAKOTA WAS BEST KNOWN AS THE DAKOTA THAT DIDN'T HAVE FARGO, WHICH IS IN NORTH DAKOTA, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, FAMOUS FOR THE MOVIE. "FARGO" WHICH TAKES PLACE IN MINNESOTA. (LAUGHTER) BUT SOUTH DAKOTA JUST GOT SOUTH INTERESTING.
IN SOUTH DAKOTA, WHICH WAS ON NO ONE'S RADAR SCREEN, NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A TIGHT RACE.
REPUBLICAN MIKE ROUNDS, WHO HAS BEEN LEADING BY DOUBLE DIGITS, NOW HOLDS ONLY A THREE-POINT LEAD OVER INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE LARRY PRESSLER.
IT'S POTENTIALLY A GAME CHANGER FOR THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IF THE REPUBLICANS LOSE THIS SEAT, I DON'T THINK THEY CAN WIN BACK CONTROL OF THE SENATE.
SUDDENLY, THERE'S A THREE-WAY RACE THERE.
IT'S A THREE-WAY RACE.
STEPHEN: YES, SOUTH DAKOTA IS A THREE-WAY RACE. NOTHING NEW TO THE STATE. THERE'S STILL A FOUR-WAY RACE FOR PRESIDENT ON MT. RUSHMORE. SOUTH DAKOTA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN EASY PICKUP FOR THE REPUBLICANS ON THEIR WAY TO A SENATE MAJORITY. BUT NOW IT'S A DEAD HEAT BETWEEN THESE THREE CANDIDATES, WHO ARE MAKING THEIR FINAL PITCH FOR CAMPAIGN CASH -- OR WHATEVER CURRENCY THEY USE IN SOUTH DAKOTA -- I BELIEVE IT'S CRUSHED SOUVENIR PENNIES FROM WALL DRUG. (LAUGHTER) AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL FIGURES IN THE STATE IS READY TO WEIGH IN. JOINING ME NOW WITH AN ENDORSEMENT THAT COULD SWAY THE RACE IS SOUTH DAKOTA GOVERNOR DENNIS DAUGAARD. GOVERNOR DAUGAARD, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: NOW, SIR, IT'S A TIGHT RACE. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE HERE TO ANNOUNCE WHO YOU'RE BACKING. CORRECT?
ABSOLUTELY. I DON'T THINK IT'LL SURPRISE ANY SOUTH DAKOTANS TO HEAR THAT I'M ENDORSING MIKE ROUNDS.
STEPHEN: OKAY. REPUBLICAN MIKE ROUNDS. WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT, SIR?
WELL, HAVING SPENT EIGHT YEARS AS A LT. GOVERNOR UNDER MIKE, I CAN SAY THAT HE HAS THE LEADERSHIP AND VISION WE NEED IN WASHINGTON. NOT TO MENTION, HE'S A HUNTING BUDDY.
STEPHEN: THERE YOU HAVE IT. BY THE WAY, GOVERNOR, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE YOUR STATE'S POLITICS THRUST INTO THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT?
IT'S THRILLING. MOST PEOPLE CAN'T IDENTIFY A SINGLE POLITICIAN FROM SOUTH DAKOTA.
STEPHEN: I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I JUST HIRED YOU, A LOCAL ACTOR, TO PLAY THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH DAKOTA BECAUSE I KNEW NO ONE COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S RIGHT. BY THE WAY, CAN I LEAVE THIS HEAD SHOT WITH YOU?
STEPHEN: ABSOLUTELY. TOM CREEL, EVERYBODY! HE'S FANTASTIC! IT SAYS HERE, UNDER SPECIAL SKILLS, HE CAN JUGGLE! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
