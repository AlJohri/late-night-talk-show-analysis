Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK, A  AL AND A MIDDLE MIDDLE EAST, BUT I JUST CALL HIM CHIEF. PLEASE WELCOME HIS EMFINANCE,  TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HEY, THANKS SO MUCH.
OH, THAT'S VERY NICE.
Stephen: I GOT TO GET  MYSELF A NICE BIG RING IF YOU'RE  GOING TO BE KISSING MY HAND NOW.
NOT A BAD IDEA, STEPHEN.
Stephen: CARDINAL DOLAN,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON.
MY HONOR ON YOUR FIRST NIGHT  BACK. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
YOU'RE CARDINAL OF THE ROMAN  CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE 10th  ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFERENCE OF  CATHOLIC BISHOPS. YOU'RE THE SECOND MOST FAMOUS  CATHOLIC IN AMERICA NEXT TO  MYSELF.
ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A NEW E  BOOK CALLED PRAYING IN ROME,  REFLECTION ON THE CONCLAVE AND ELECTING POPE FRANCIS, SO THIS  BLOWS THE LID OFF THE PAPAL  CONCLAVE.
WELL, THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH  TO SAY. I LOST. THAT'S THE MAIN THING. BUT THANKS FOR... YOU AND MY MOM  ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT HAVE  REFERRED TO THIS. THIS IS GREAT.
Stephen: YOU'LL GET THE  COLBERT BUMP. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE  NUMBER-ONE CHURCH-BASED E-BOOK.
I'LL TAKE IT.
Stephen: I WOULD SWEAR TO  GOD, BUT... ALL RIGHT. OKAY. YOU WERE IN THERE. WHAT'S IT LIKE, FOR THE PEOPLE  WHO HAVEN'T BEEN IN THERE, AND  THAT'S EVERYBODY EXCEPT YOU CARDINALS, NOBODY HERE BUT US  CARDINALS, WHEN THE DOORS SHUT  AND THEY PUT THAT SEAL ON THERE, WHAT'S FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS  IN THAT ROOM? DO YOU GUYS SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT  'EM? WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?
I TELL YOU, THE FIRST THING  WE DO IS PRAY, AND WE PRAY HARD  BECAUSE DO WE EVER NEED HELP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT UP TO THE  TASK, SO WE ASK FOR THE  INSPIRATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND I THINK THE SPIRIT COMES  THROUGH. THEY TOLD US, STEPHEN, THEY  SAID, LOOK, THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS  ALREADY CHOSEN THE NEW POPE, YOU GUYS JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO  HE'S CHOSEN, WHICH ISN'T A BAD  EXPLANATION OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE CONCLAVE. SO WE PRAY AND ASKING FOR  GUIDANCE.
Stephen: IS THERE OUIJA OR  ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO TEA LEAVES OR ANYTHING.
Stephen: NO CHICKEN BONES?
NEW YORK WE'RE NOT INTO  VOODOO. SO TELL ME ABOUT THE FIRST  ROUND.
AS AN HISTORIAN, I DON'T  THINK SO. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ELECTED THE  FIRST DAY AFTER TWO OR THREE  BALLOTS. THERE'S FOUR BALLOTS A DAY, TWO  IN THE MORNING, TWO IN THE  AFTERNOON. THERE'S BEEN POPES ELECTED THE  FIRST DAY, BUT I DON'T THINK THE  FIRST BALLOT.
BECAUSE ON THE FIRST BALLOT  YOU GOT TO IMAGINE EVERYBODY'S  VOTING FOR THEMSELVES, JUST IN CASE, MAYBE THERE IS WAVE BEHIND  ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
I THINK ST. PETER HAD IT  PRETTY EASY. HE WAS APPOINTED FIRST POPE BY  JESUS. HE GOT IT PRETTY EASY. AFTER THAT...
Stephen: NOW, YOU DID NOT  GET THE GIG, AS I SAID. I WAS PRETTY NICE BECAUSE I HAD  $50 ON IT. [LAUGHTER] DID YOU VOTE FOR THE GUY WHO  EVENTUALLY GOT THE GIG, POPE  FRANCIS.
WELL, I CAN'T SAY THAT.
Stephen: WHY NOT?
WE CAN'T SAY WHO WE VOTED  FOR.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE SAYING  IT'S NOT UNANIMOUS.
BUT I'M GLAD HE GOT IT. I THINK WE DID A GOOD JOB, DON'T  YOU? YOU WERE JUST OVER THERE, BUT  THERE IS A NEW SPIRIT.
Stephen: LET ME BE CLEAR,  HE IS THE VICAR OF CHRIST.
YES.
Stephen: HE IS OUR DIRECT  CONNECTION TO ST. PETER, WHO IS  APPOINTED THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH BY OUR LORD WHILST HE WALKED THE  EARTH IN HIS FLESH.
YOU GOT IT RIGHT.
I DON'T CARE FOR THE GUY. OKAY.
HE LOVES YOU, STEPHEN. HE CARES FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU.
Stephen: IT'S UNREQUIETED  AT THE MOMENT. I TELL YOU WHAT, HERE'S THE  THING, HE'S TOO SOFT. HE'S TOO SOFT ON SIN FOR ME,  THIS NEW POPE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: YOU HEARD WHAT HE  SAID ABOUT ATHEISTS.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
Stephen: HE SAID THAT EVEN  ATHEISTS ARE REDEEMED BY CHRIST. EVEN ATHEISTS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: SORRY. WE USUALLY SCREEN THESE PEOPLE. IF EVEN ATHEISTS ARE REDEEMED BY  CHRIST, WHY HAVE I BEEN GOING TO  MASS ON SUNDAY. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANOTHER NINE  HOLES IN. I DON'T WANT... LOOK, WHAT DO  YOU THINK THAT MEANS?
LOOK, YOU DON'T GO TO MASS TO  WIN HEAVEN, RIGHT? YOU GO TO MASS TO ASK GOD FOR  HELP TO GET THERE. YOU DON'T GO TO WIN HEAVEN  BECAUSE WE CAN'T EARN IT. IT'S A GIFT. IT'S GIVEN TO ALL OF US, EVEN  ATHEISTS.
Stephen: I DON'T ALWAYS  KNOW WHY I'M GOING TO MASS.
BUT I'M GLAD YOU DO.
Stephen: I'M USUALLY GLAD I  DID. YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE  A LITTLE BREAK. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
I'LL BE HAPPY TO. THIS GRAPA IS GREAT FROM ITALY. YOU BROUGHT SOME BACK.
Stephen: THAT'S PURE GRAPA. IT'S LIKE JET FUEL. YOU'LL BE DANCING ON THE TAKE BY  THE TIME WE'RE DONE. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE TIMOTHY
