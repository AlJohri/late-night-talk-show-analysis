Stephen:  THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. [CROWD CHEERING] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. I GOT TO SAY, DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, I HEARD SOME ACCUSATIONS THAT MY SUPERB OWL COVERAGE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT TO GET RATINGS BY TALKING ABOUT SUNDAY'S TRADEMARK LET'S CALL IT SPORT-GASM 48. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE SUPERB ALL CONTAINS THE SAME LETTERS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON SUNDAY IN THE EXACT SAME ORDER. HELLO. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A THING CALLED COIN CIDENCE? THIS IS ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF MAN'S BEST FRIEND OWLS AND I'M COMMITTED TO THESE MAJESTIC BIRDS OF PREY AS I AM FOR NOT GETTING SUED FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. AMERICA IS BRIMMING WITH HOT OWL CONTROVERSY.
THE SPOTTED ALL WAS CONSIDERED A SPECIES IN THE NORTHWEST FOR 20 YEARS BUT NOW THE SPECIES IS FACING A NEW THREAT BY ANOTHER SPECIALS OF ALL.
AN INVASIVE SPECIES OF THE EAST.
AS THE BARRED OWLS MOVE  INTO AN AREA THEY'RE VERY TERRITORIAL AND CHASE THE SPOTTED OWLS.
THEY WANT TO KILL ONE SPECIES TO SAVE ANOTHER.
FOLKS THIS MOVE BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION RAISES MANY TROUBLING QUESTIONS. SHOULD WE KILL ONE SPECIES TO PROTECT ANOTHER. IF I DON'T TALK ABOUT OWLS AT LEAST ONCE THIS WEEK, COULD THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE LAWYERS KILL ME TO PROTECT THEIR TRADEMARK. HERE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IS THE CEO OF THE NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY DAVID YARNELL. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. AARON, YOU'RE HERE WITH AN OWL. IS THE BARRED OWL THE MOST SUPERB OWL.
IT'S A GREAT HUNTER, IT LIVES IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TERRAIN AND THE HABITAT IT'S INVADING IS HABITAT THAT'S DECAYING AND IT'S NOT BEING WELL TAKEN CARE OF.
Stephen:  WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? DO YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A CULLING OF THE BARRED OWLS.
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE A CULLING BUT I THINK THE KEY IS TO FOCUS IN THE UNDERLYING HABITAT PROBLEMS THAT THOSE FORESTS IN THE NORTHWEST HAVE BEEN OVERLOGGED AND NOT WELL TAKEN CARE OF.
Stephen:  WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL TAKE PLACE. HEAVEN FORBID BUT IF I WERE TO SMOTHER THIS OWL, I SAID DON'T WORRY, WOULD I THEN BE GIVEN THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM?
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY NOT HOW THE WILDLIFE FISH SERVICE SET IT UP.
Stephen:  WE'RE JUST TALKING HERE. [LAUGHTER] SO YOU ALSO WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW OWLS YOU REALIZE WHAT TREMENDOUS HUNTERS THEY ARE. THEY ARE LIKE THE STEALTH FIGHTERS OF BIRDS. THEY HAVE AMAZING, THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WINGS THAN OTHER BIRDS SO THAT IN DARK THEY CAN FLY, THEY CAN HUNT, THEY CAN SEE IN NEARLY PITCH DARKNESS. THE WIND JUST WHISTLES OVER THEM. YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T HEAR THEM COMING.
Stephen:  THAT SOUNDS  TERRIFYING. WHY CAN SHE TURN HER HEAD SO FAR AROUND. IS SHE POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL.
OWLS ARE REMARKABLY FLEXIBLE. THEY CAN TURN THEIR HEADS 370 DEGREES.
Stephen:  WHAT DO  OWLS EAT OTHER THAN TOOTSIE POPS.
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT. IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE OWL BUT SQUIRRELS, MICE, SNAKES. OTHER TYPES OF RODENTS. EVEN OTHER KINDS OF BIRDS.
Stephen:  LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG GAME ON SUNDAY FOR JUST A MOMENT HERE.
SURE.
Stephen:  OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE OUT THERE KNOWS EVERY YEAR WE IN THE PRESS LOOK TO PSYCHIC ANIMALS. LIKE A CLAIRVOYANT OCTOPUS TO PICK THE WINNER OF THE BIG GAME. THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING WITH THE OWL. SOPHIA I WANT YOU TO POINT YOUR WING AT THE TEAM YOU LIKE BETTER. I'VE GOT TWO ADORABLE BUNNIES OVER HERE, ONE IN A SEAHAWKS JERSEY AND ONE IN A BRONCOS JERSEY. SO SOPHIA LET ME ASK YOU, WHICH TEAM DO YOU LIKE FOR SUNDAY'S MATCH UP. SOPHIA, NO. I WANT TO ASSURE EVERYONE THAT GRIEF COUNSELORS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE AUDIENCE AFTER TONIGHT'S SHOW. WELL EITHER SOPHIA HATES THEM BOTH OR LOVES THEM BOTH. WE'LL SIFT THROUGH HER PELLETS AND SEE WHICH JERSEY EMERGES FIRST.
