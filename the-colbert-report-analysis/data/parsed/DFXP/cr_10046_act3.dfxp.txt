Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A RENOWNED ART CRITIC. SHE'S ABOUT TO MEET AN ART CRITIC CRITIC. PLEASE WELCOME DEBORAH SOLOMON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DEBORAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR COMING ON. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. NOW MADAME, AS I SAID BEFORE, YOU'RE AN ART CRITIC. I'M GOING TO WARN YOU UP FRONT I'M NO FAN OF THE FORM, ALL RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) IF ART HAS TO BE EXPLAINED TO ME CHUCK IT. ALL RIGHT?
YEAH. YEAH.
Stephen: YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF --
WELL, I'LL TRY TO HELP YOU TONIGHT. I'LL TRY TO TEACH YOU HOW TO LOOK AT A PAINTING.
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I'VE GOT WITH YOU. YOU'VE WRITTEN PREVIOUS BIOGRAPHIES OF JACKSON POLLOCK, JOSEPH CORNELL. YOUR NEW BOOK IS CALLED "AMERICAN MIRROR, THE LIFE AND ART OF NORMAN ROCKWELL."
CORRECT.
Stephen: HERE'S MY BEEF, DEB. THE REASON I LIKE NORMAN ROCKWELL IS HE'S NOT LIKE ONE OF THESE AVANT-GARDE GUYS WHERE I HAVE TO GO INTO A ROOM IN A MUSEUM AND THERE'S A PILE OF UNCOOKED SPAGHETTI WITH A LAMP OVER IT AND THEY GO "THAT'S ART ART." HE PAINTS A MAILMAN AND I GO "THAT'S A MAILMAN." WHY DO I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME?
WELL, IT'S INTERESTING. DURING HIS LIFETIME-- YOU PROBABLY KNOW-- HE WAS DERIDED BY THE ART COMMUNITY.
Stephen: BY THE ELITES, PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
BY ART HISTORIANS AS A NON-ENTITY AND A TOXIC CULTURE POLLUTER.
Stephen: AN ILLUSTRATOR, THEY CALLED HIM.
A LOWLY ILLUSTRATOR WHO PAINTED MAGAZINE COVERS AND CALENDARS WITH BOY SCOUTS ON THEM. BUT NOW IT'S EXACTLY 36 YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH, AND  I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT HIS WORK IN THAT IT HAS TURNED OUT TO HAVE THE STAYING POWER OF THE ABSTRACT PAINTING THAT WAS CELEBRATED DURING HIS LIFETIME.
Stephen: WELL LET'S LOOK AT THIS MAN'S WORK. JIM, LET'S PUT UP THE FIRST ONE HERE. THIS PAINTING RIGHT HERE, THIS FIRST ONE, THAT'S ROCKWELL HIMSELF?
YES, THAT'S A SELF-PORTRAIT.
Stephen: IT'S A REALISTIC PORTRAIT BUT IN SOME WAYS IT'S ALMOST DEALING WITH THE SURREALIST REPUTATION OF THE ARTIST HIMSELF. DO I SOUND LIKE AN ART CRITIC BECAUSE I JUST PULLED THAT (BLEEP) OUT OF MY ASS.
NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE PAINTING IS THAT HE IS COMPARING HIS SORT OF RUMPLED APPEARANCE WITH THE IDEALIZED IMAGE ON THE CANVAS. HE'S TELLING US THAT ART IDEALIZES. ART IS A LIE THAT TELLS THE TRUTH.
Stephen: I'LL BUY THAT ONE. LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ONE. THIS ONE IS -- WHAT'S THIS CALLED?
"FREEDOM FROM WANT." IT'S ONE OF THE FOUR FREEDOMS HE PAINTED TO ILLUSTRATE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S IDEAS ABOUT WHY WE WERE FIGHTING WORLD WAR II.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME HE WAS A LIBERAL RIGHT. HE WAS DOING IT FOR ROOSEVELT BUT HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A COMMIE SOCIALIST LIKE ROOSEVELT. THIS GUY IS A HEARTLAND PAINTER. THIS GUY IS FROM THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA.
NO, HE'S BEEN MISAPPROPRIATED BY RIGHT WINGERS. HE WAS A MAN WHO BELIEVED IN EQUALITY AND TOLERANCE AND WHO VOTED FOR J.F.K. IN 1960 AND LBJ IN 1964.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS, THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR A CRITIC TALK ABOUT IT. AND YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW HE PAINTED THE DEFINING IMAGE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IN 1964, THE PROBLEM WE ALL LIVE WITH,  SO PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO TURN HIM INTO SOME CARTOON VERSION OF AN ALL WHITE BORING AMERICA DON'T HOLD MUCH CREDENCE WITH ME.
Stephen: HE DID PAINT A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE.
HE DID. HE DID.
Stephen: LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ONE. OK THIS THING, WHAT'S THIS ONE CALLED?
"SAYING GRACE."
Stephen: THIS THING JUST SOLD AT SOTHEBYS ON DECEMBER 5th FOR $46 MILLION.
THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen: THE HIGHEST PRICE EVER PAID.
Stephen: WE STILL DON'T KNOW -- FOR WHAT, FOR THAT PAINTING?
FOR AN AMERICAN PAINTING. WELL, FOR AN AMERICAN PAINTING OF THAT PERIOD MEANING WE'RE LOOKING AT ARTISTS LIKE ROCKWELL--
LIKE REPRESENTATIONAL ART EDWARD HOPPER AND GEORGIA O'KEEFE. YES, IT IS REPRESENTATIONAL, CORRECT.
Stephen: SO ISN'T IT THE BEST REPRESENTATIONAL ART IF IT COSTS THE MOST? HASN'T THE MARKET SPOKEN?
NO, NO! I WANT TO TELL YOU --.
Stephen: DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE FREE MARKET?
I BELIEVE THAT THE MARKET IS A CRITIC BUT IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD CRITIC.
Stephen: NOT AS GOOD A ONE AS DEBORAH SOLOMON, LET ME GUESS.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: THE MARKET'S GOING TO DETERMINE HOW GOOD YOUR BOOK  IS, BY THE WAY. DON'T INSULT THE MARKET, DEB. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS SOLD FOR SO MUCH MONEY? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
IT'S ALSO A THANKSGIVING PICTURE, LIKE THE ONE WE JUST SAW. AND IT SHOWS A GRANDMOTHER AND HER GRANDSON GIVING THANKS IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSTLING DINER. THE DETAIL IS EXQUISITE, YOU CAN MAKE OUT THE "NEW YORK TIMES" MASTHEAD UP FRONT.
Stephen: YOU CAN SEE THE FORK AND KNIFE DOWN THERE.
BUT DO YOU SEE THE "NEW YORK TIMES"? HE READ THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
Stephen: EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR FLAWS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: HERE'S MY REAL PROBLEM WITH YOU. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE A CRITIC, BUT NOT BEING JUST A CRITIC YOU'RE TRYING TO BE SOME KIND OF CRITICAL SLEUTH. BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS NEXT PAINTING HERE. YOU HAVE LOOKED AT SOME OF HIS PAINTINGS AND YOU'VE SAID YOU DETECT A PREFERENCE FOR MEN OVER WOMEN IN HIS SUBJECTS AND YOU'RE PROJECTING THAT IN THE POSSIBILITY OF HOMOEROTIC UNDERTONES IN HIS WORK.
WELL, IT'S TRUE HE DID PAINT MEN MORE THAN WOMEN. HE WAS A FIGURE PAINTER WHO FAVORED MEN AND THAT'S UNUSUAL BECAUSE MOST FIGURE PAINTERS PAINT WOMEN. PICASSO, FOR INSTANCE, YOU KNOW PICASSO PAINTED WOMEN.
Stephen: AND PUT TOO MANY OF THESE ON 'EM. (LAUGHTER)
MATISSE, WOMEN. GAUGIN, WOMEN.
Stephen: SO HE PAINTED A LOT OF GUYS -- SO HE PAINTED A LOT OF GUYS YOU'RE SAYING IT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE GAY TENDENCIES? YOU'RE SAYING HE MIGHT BE HOMOSEXUAL, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! DON'T BACK AWAY FROM THIS ONE DEB.
WHEN YOU USED THE WORD HOMOEROTIC DO YOU KNOW EVEN KNOW WHAT HOMOEROTIC MEANS?
Stephen: IT MEANS BAD! HOMOEROTIC DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE PERMANENTLY ANYTHING. IT JUST REFERS TO A PASSING IMPULSE. SO IF ONE FEELS A HOMOEROTIC IMPULSEIN THIS WORK, AS AN ART HISTORIAN MIGHT SAY, IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TWO MALE FIGURES SHOWING AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER. AND I --.
Stephen: SO THE SUBJECT CAN TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE FEELINGS OF THE PAINTER SEXUALLY?
WELL, IT CAN TELL US -- IT CAN TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE ARTIST'S IMAGINATION AND WHAT EXCITED HIS GAZE.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE SAYING WARHOL IMAGINED GETTING IT ON WITH SOUP CANS? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO WARHOL'S SEXUALITY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST A CAN OF WORMS. A CAMPBELL'S SOUP OF -- A CAMPBELL'S SOUP CAN OF WORMS.
Stephen: HMM,MM GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. DEBORAH SOLOMON. THE BOOK IS "AMERICAN MIRROR." NORMAN ROCKWELL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
