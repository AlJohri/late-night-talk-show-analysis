Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. IT'S GOOD TO YOU HAVE HERE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU KNOW I LOVE OUR NATION'S AMBASSADORS. WHAT I CAN SAY, I'M A BIT OF AN AMBASSMAN, THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE SENATE CONFIRMATION OF U.S. AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY. THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR BEING A BOLD CHOICE AND ALSO A BEAUTIFUL ONE.
A SOAP OPERA PRODUCER JUST BECAME THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE COUNTRY OF HUNGARY. SHE'S THE PRODUCER OF THE TV SHOW "THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL"
YES, COLLEEN BELL, A FORMER "THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL"" PRODUCER IS NOW THE AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY. AND ONE ASSUMES ITS EVIL TWIN, SERGIO. AND SURE, COLLEEN BELL HAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH FOREIGN SERVICE OR SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NATION HUNGARY. BUT FOLKS, SHE WAS NOMINATED FOR THE MOST NOBLE OF ALL REASONS, SHE CONTRIBUTED $800,000 TO OBAMA IN THE LAST ELECTION AND BUNDLED MORE THAN $2.1 MILLION FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RE-ELECTION EFFORT. HEY, FOLKS, THAT IS JUST QUID PRO QUO. YOU SCRATCH THE PRESIDENT'S BACK, HE APPOINTS YOU AMBASSADOR OF SCRATCHBACKISTAN. BUT THE CONFIRMATION TOOK A SHOCKING TWIST WHEN LONG TIME FRIEND OF THIS SHOW SINCE MONDAY, JOHN McCAIN, RIPPED BELL ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE.
THERE IS NO IT DOUBT THAT SINCE TAKING OFFICE IN 2010, THE HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER MR. VICTOR ORBAN HAS CENTRALIZED POWER. MR. ORBAN IS COZYING UP TO VLADIMIR PUTIN.
I AM NOT AGAINST POLITICAL APPOINTEES. I AM NOT AGAINST-- I UNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED. BUT HERE WE ARE, A NATION THAT IS ON THE VERGE OF CEDING ITS SOVEREIGNTY TO A NEO-FASCIST DICTATOR GETTING IN BED WITH PUTIN AND WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE PRODUCER OF "THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL".
Stephen: WELL, WHO DO YOU WANT, JOHN? WHAT DO YOU WANT, SOMEONE FROM "THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"? THEY WOULD BE TOO INEXPERIENCED, THEN GET BORED AND QUIT. FOLKS, JOHN McCAIN IS DEAD WRONG HERE. I HAVE DEEP ROOTS IN HUNGARY. I HAVE A BRIDGE NAMED AFTER ME THERE. AND THE HUNGARIAN AMBASSADOR HIMSELF MADE ME AN HONORARY CITIZEN. MY ONLY QUALIFICATION, I AM ON TV. RIGHT THERE. THERE'S YOUR PROOF. AND FOLKS, "THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL" IS PERFECT TRAINING TO BE AN AMBASSADOR. HUNGARY IS A REGION RIFE WITH DRAMA AND THE CONSTANT THREAT-OF-VIOLENCE. EXACTLY THE SITUATION THE  FORRESTER FAMILY ROUTINELY HANDLED FROM THEIR PALLACIOUS ESTATE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING THEIR FASHION EMPIRE. AND I AM CONFIDENT IF COLLEEN BELL WAS ABLE TO HANDLE THE ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN MARRIAGE BETWEEN SALLIE'S DAUGHTER MACY ALEXANDER AND THORN FORRESTER WHOM SHE EVENTUALLY LOST TO BROOK ONLY TO REUNIT WITH HIM BEFORE FALLING IN LOVE WITH RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC DEACON SHARP, OF COURSE THAT WAS BEFORE SHE FELL INTO A COMA AND HER FAMILY PULLED THE PLUG, THEN YEAH, I THINK COLLEEN BELL CAN HANDLE A SHIRTLESS GUY ON A PONY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS, COME ON, COME ON. AMATEUR HOUR. THE POINT IS, I FULLY SUPPORT COLLEEN BELL'S APPOINTMENT. TO BE THE AMBASSADOR --
STEPHEN, WAIT.
DR. DELVECCHIO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU CAN'T LET COLLEEN BELL BE AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY. SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED. AND I SHOULD KNOW, I'M HER LESBIAN LOVER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: BUT-- BUT DOCTOR, YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN.
MAYBE. OR MAYBE I HAD A SEXUAL REASSIGNMENT SURGERY TO BECOME A MIDDLE-AGED ITALIAN MAN.
Stephen: BUT, BUT THAT WOULD MEAN --
I'M CARRYING YOUR BABY. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHY DOES THAT MAKE COLLEEN BELL UNQUALIFIED?
OH, I'LL TELL YOU. AFTER THIS MESSAGE FROM CALGON.
