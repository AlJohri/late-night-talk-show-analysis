Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK THESE DAYS ABOUT EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN. WELL, I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK. I WASN'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION. GAME IS ON. IT TURNS OUT EARNING LESS IS GOOD. JUST ASK CONSERVATIVE ICON AND LADY WHO GIVES OUT RAISINS  AT HALLOWEEN, PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY. SHE WROTE WOMEN TYPICALLY CHOOSE A MATE, HUSBAND, OR BOYFRIEND WHO EARNS MORE THAN SHE DOES. WHILE WOMEN PEFER A HIGHER EARNING PARTNER, MEN LIKE TO BE THE HIGHER EARNING PARTNER. MEN LIKE WOMEN WHO DON'T EARN MUCH MONEY. THAT'S WHY THE HOTTEST PLACE TO PICK UP A LADY IS A HOMELESS SHELTER. BUT BE CAREFUL FELLAS, HER IMAGINARY ROOMMATE IS CRAZY. THE OPPOSITE IS ALSO TRUE-- WOMEN ARE ATTRACTED TO MEN WHO MAKE MORE MONEY. WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN SLEEP WITH DONALD TRUMP? ( LAUGHTER ) SERIOUSLY, DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY? ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT A DARE LIKE THE CINNAMON CHALLENGE OR SOMETHING? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT WOULD EXPLAIN HIS SKIN COLOR. NOW, THE DANGER-- THE DANGER SCHLAFLY WARNS IS THAT IF WE ELIMINATE THE PAY GAP, ROMANCE WILL DIE, SIMPLE ARITHMETIC SUGGESTS HALF OF WOMEN WOULD BE UNABLE TO FIND WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SUITABLE MATE. IF A HIGHER EARNING MAN IS NOT AVAILABLE, MANY WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY NOT TO MARRY AT ALL. SO ENJOY YOUR EQUAL PAY, LADIES. YOU CAN SPEND IT ON FRISKIES FOR YOUR HUNDREDS OF CATS BECAUSE YOU'RE DYING ALONE. WOMEN, COME ON. WOMEN, BE HONEST. BE HONEST, WOMEN. DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT-- YOU LIKE A GUY TO EARN MORE THAN YOU. SAME WAY YOU LIKE THEM TO OPEN DOORS OR GIVE UP THEIR SEAT ON THE BUS YOU'RE RIDING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CAR. ( LAUGHTER ) MEANWHILE, SCHLAFLY'S ARTICLE TOUCHED OFF THE PREDICTABLE MEDIA FIRESTORM FROM THE LIBERAL LADIES. BUT COME ON, IF THESE FEMALE JOURNALISTS REALLY THOUGHT THEY SHOULD GET PAID MORE, WHY DID THEY GO INTO JOURNALISM? AND THESE DAMES DON'T REALIZE THAT SCHLAFLY IS TRYING TO HELP WOMEN BY HELPING MEN SO THEY CAN HELP WOMEN. AS PHYLLIS SO ELOQUENTLY SAID, THE PAY GAP HELPS PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN MARRIAGES. THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS FOR WOMEN IS TO IMPROVE JOB PROSPECTS FOR MEN IN THEIR LIVES, EVEN THAT MEANS INCREASING THE SO-CALLED PAY GAP. WELL SAID. TO HELP WOMEN, WE MAY NEED TO INCREASE THE PAY GAP. 77 CENTS TO THE DOLLAR IS A GOOD START BUT WE CAN DO BETTER. WHY NOT 50 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR? OR, OR CALL ME A RADICAL FEMINIST, BUT MAYBE WOMEN SHOULDN'T BE PAID AT ALL. DON'T LISTEN TO ME, LADIES. I'M JUST A GUY WHO MAKES MORE THAN YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY HERE. TOMORROW MORNING I WANT YOU TO MARCH INTO YOUR BOSS' OFFICE AND SAY MR. THOMPSON I'VE PROVEN MYSELF. I'VE GOT INITIATIVE. I'VE GOT ENTHUSIASM. I'VE EXCEEDED MY SALES QUOTA WHICH IS WHY I DEMAND A 25% PAY CUT AND GIVE THAT MONEY TO CHUCK IN THE MAILROOM. HE'S NICE. SHE'S SINGLE, AND IF I COULDN'T MAKE RENT, HE'D SEEM LIKE A DREAM BOAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
