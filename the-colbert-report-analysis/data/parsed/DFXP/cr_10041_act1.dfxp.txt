Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. HAPPY NEW YEAR! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY HAPPY NEW YEAR. AND OF COURSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-- MERRY CHRISTMAS. OKAY? MERRY CHRISTMAS, FOLKS. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE OR TOO EARLY. (LAUGHTER) GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, FOLKS. AND BY WITH US I MEAN STILL LIVING. BECAUSE 2014 IS ALL TO A FRIGID START, FOLKS. IT WAS SO COLD ON NEW YEAR'S EVE THAT THE BALL WENT BACK UP. IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS, NOW FOLKS, IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF MY VOICE, FIRST OF ALL OPEN YOUR EYES. NOW IF YOU ARE LISTENING AND WATCHING FROM ANYWHERE EAST OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, I HOPE YOU WALKED YOUR WINDOWS, STOCKED YOUR SOUP CUPBOARD AND PUT THAT TO OBESE RELATIVE TO SLICE OPEN AND CALL INSIDE. BECAUSE THIS IS NO ODE COLD SNAP THIS IS A MONSTER.
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A HURRICANE T SWIRLS AND IT SWIRLS AT A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR THAT IS OUR POLAR VOR WEX OPINIONS POLAR VORTEX.
POLAR VORTEX.
YEAH, POLAR VORTEX.
WE COULD HAVE THUNDER SNOW.
THUNDER SNOW.
Stephen: YES, WE'RE BEING HIT BY A POLAR VORTEX AND THUNDER SNOW! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND FRANKLY, FOLKS, I'M NOT SURE IF THOSE ARE WEATHER PATTERNS OR FINISHING MOVES FROM MORTAL COME BAT. AND AS A NEWSMAN, I WANT TO SALUTE WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THE TERM POLAR VORTEX. (LAUGHTER) IT IS TERRIFYING BUT STILL SOUNDS ALL SCIENCEY. NOW A LESSER METEOROLOGIST COULD HAVE OVERREACHED WITH ARCTIC COLD-NADO OR A CLASS CAN DICK PUNCH BUT POLAR VORTEX IS RESTRAINED BUT MENACING.
ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK SURVIVING THIS POLAR VORTEX. I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE ON THURSDAY IT WILL BE IN THE MID 40s OR WHAT I'M CALLING PARTLY CLOUD-POCOLYPSE WITH A 20% CHANCE OF REYNA-GEDDON. CHIRS PLAUS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW CHECK BACK IN WITH STEVEN ---- STEPHEN WITH THE NEWS. (LAUGHTER) THANKS, STEVE.
NATION, HERE AT THE REPORT THERE ARE NO WRONG ANSWERS BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO TALKS. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) FIRST UP ON THE,-- WORKING ON IT, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY THE GOVERNMENT PASSES YET ANOTHER NEW FREEDOM-KILLING REGULATION. FIRST THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO WEAR A SEAT BELT. THEN THEY TELL ME MY CHILD HAS TO RIDE IN THE CAR SEAT. WHAT'S NEXT. THE CAR SEAT HAS TO BE INSIDE THE CAR? HE LOVES TO SEE THE WIND ON THE FONTANELLE. WELL, NOW GOVERNMENT REGULATORS ARE AT IT AGAIN.
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REVEALS A NEW PLAN TODAY TO CUT DOWN THE USE ON ANTIBIOTICS IN FOOD ANIMALS. THE FDA CALLS OVERUSE OF ANTI-BIOTICS A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH.
Stephen: THESE FDA-HOLES ARE COMING AFTER-- THEY'RE COMING AFTER A FOOD ANIMALS AS IF THERE'S ANY OTHER KIND. SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE FDA. FIRST OF ALL ANTI-BIOTICS ARE THE ONLY NUTRITION LEFT IN OUR MEATS. THAT AND THE BLUE DYE IN THE USDA SAMPLE. MY DOCTOR SAYS I'M TO THE GETTING ENOUGH SAP. AND OUR LIVESTOCKS NEED THESE ANTI-BIOTICS TO GAIN AS MUCH AS 3% MORE WEIGHT. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, FOLKS, YOU WANT TO GAIN WEIGHT QUICKLY TAKE ANTI-BIOTICS. YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT QUICKLY YOU EAT UNREGULATED BEEF. HOW ELSE CAN YOU GET ANIMALS TO GAIN WEIGHT. CHICKENS WON'T DRINK MUSCLE MILK. I GOT THEM A STRAW AND EVERYTHING. NOTHING. (LAUGHTER) NEXT UP, FOLKS I BELIEVE CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE. EVEN THOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE MOST OF MY CHILDHOOD WAS IN THE PAST. I GOT SCREWED ON THAT ONE. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO TOY MANUFACTURERS FOR BRINGING THE TOYS OF TOMORROW TO THE FUTURE PEOPLES OF TODAY.
FISHER-PRICE HAS RELEASED THE NEWBORN TODDLER APP DIFFICULTITY SEAT. A BABY BOUNCEY SEAT THAT FEATURES A PLASTIC CASE DESIGNED TO HOLD AN iPAD.
Stephen: OH, FOLKS, I WISH WE HAD THE APP-TIVITY BABY SEAT WHEN I HAD MY FIRST CHILD. I HAD TO SETTLE FROM PLOPPING HER IN FRONT OF THE MICROWAVE. MY DAUGHTER'S FAVORITE SHOW WAS SWANSON SALISBURY STEAK FOR 10 MINUTES ON DEFROST. IT HAS A SURPRISE ENDING. ABOUT AN HOUR LATER. NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THAT PUTTING AN iPAD IN FRONT OF AN INFANT MIGHT BE HARMFUL IN SOME WAY. BUT DON'T WORRY YOU CAN LOCK YOUR iPAD INTO THE CASE PROTECTING YOUR DEVICE FROM BABY'S STICKY FINGERS. SEE, NOTHING IS GOING TO HURT YOUR PRECIOUS DARLING. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO DOCK BOTH YOUR iPAD AND YOUR CHILD.
AS A MOM, I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT POTTY TRAINING IT BE. IT CAN BE A LITTLE EASIER NOW WITH THE BRAND-NEW I-POTTY THIS POTTY TRAINING SEAT FEATURES A SPECIAL STAND TO SECURELY HOLD THE iPAD WHICH KIDS ALREADY LOVE. SO THEY CAN PLAY WITH APPS, READ BOOKS OR WATCH VIDEOS. ALL WHILE POTTY TRAINING. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I-- I WANT ONE. I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD USE AN iPAD ON THE TOILET. I GENERALLY NEED ALL FOUR LIMBS FOR STABILITY. AGAIN, SALISBURY STEAK. AND WHAT A GREAT TOOL FOR TRAINING THE KIDS. THEY'LL FOREVER ASSOCIATE THE iPAD WITH POOPING. JUST AVOID BRINGING THEM INTO AN APPLE STORE. FINALLY, FOLKS, THERE IS NO GREATER FAMILY TRADITION THAN GATHERING TOGETHER AND PLAYING BOARD GAMES. REMEMBER THE FAMILY THAT PLAYS TOGETHER, STAYS TOGETHER BECAUSE A SINGLE GAME OF RISK CAN LAST DECADES. IT WILL BE A COLD DAY IN HELL BEFORE MY SISTER-IN-LAW SHARON GETS HER GRUBBY PAWS ON IRKUTSK, THE GATEWAY TO CAME CHAT SKA. -- KAMCHATKA. BUT FOLKS THESE FUN GAMES AREN'T ALL FUN AND GAMES. THEY'RE ALSO EDUCATIONAL. THINK OF ALL THE SPANISH LEARNED -- WORDS I LEARNED FROM PLAYING UNO. (APPLAUSE)
HOW MANY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I LEARNED ONEO. (LAUGHTER) BUT FINALLY, THERE IS A GAME TO TEACH OUR KIDS WHAT THEY REALLY NEED TO KNOW.
IT'S THE NEW GAME OF GUESSING LOGOS WHEN YOU DRAW T DESCRIBE IT, DO IT OR REVEAL IT PICK AN ACTION, SET THE TIMER AND GO.
OH.
NOW WHAT.
REALLY, DO IT, DESCRIBE IT OR REVEAL IT. LOGO AND ALL NEW LOGO PARTY. THE BRANDS YOU KNOW, THE GAMES YOU LOVE.
Stephen: IT'S JUST LIKE CHAR ADDS OTHER THAN ACTING OUT MOVIES AND TV SHOWS YOU'RE PAYING MONEY TO MEM ORIZE CORPORATE MARKETING. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP OF THE HAT TO LOGO PARTY. JUST DO IT, IT'S GREAT. MAYBE IT'S MAYBELLINE. FOLKS IT IS HUGE.
FOLKS, IT USED TO BE SO HARD TO FIND ADVERTISEMENTS. YOU HAD TO SIT THROUGH BORING TELEVISION SHOWS OR LOAD AN INTERNET VIDEO OR BE SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA. WITH LOGO PARTY IMAGINE THE FUN YOU'LL HAVE GUESSING IF THAT'S THE G LOGO FROM GUCHI OR C LOGO FROM CHANNEL AND THEN FEELING BAD ABOUT YOURSELF THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD EITHER ONE. THE GAME ENDS WHEN ONE PLAY ERR DRAWS THE CORD FOR THE LOGO PARTY LOGO FORCING EVERYONE TO ACT OUT ALL THE BRANDS IN LOGO PARTY SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING A CORPORATE SYNERGY BLACK HOLE THAT SUCKS IN YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY UNTIL SOMEBODY REALIZES THE BLACK HOLE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE LOGO FOR OAKLEY SUNGLASSES. YOU WIN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THESE LOGOS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MUCH
