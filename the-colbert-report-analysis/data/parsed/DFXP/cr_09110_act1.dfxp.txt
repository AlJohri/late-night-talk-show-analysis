--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS  MEANS. PLEASE, NATION, I APPRECIATE  THE WELCOME. PLEASE SIT DOWN. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK  ABOUT. LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE  ALL THE SUPPORT YOU'RE  GIVING ME TONIGHT BECAUSE I  COME TO YOU WITH A HEAVY  HEART. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE MY  PRESHOW COCKTAILS OF BOURBON  AND NUTELLA. NO, FOLKS, I AM ENSADDENED  BY THE RECENT ANNOUNCED  RETIREMENT OF AN  CONSERVATIVE GIANT MICHELE  BACHMANN. (LAUGHTER)  YES, TRUE. THE CONGRESSWOMAN WHO  REPRESENTS MINNESOTA'S  VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. SHE BROKE THE NEWS IN A WEB  VIDEO RECORDED AT, I BELIEVE,  THE SEARS PORTRAIT STUDIO. (LAUGHTER)
JIM?
AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF  THOUGHT AND DELIBERATION I  HAVE DECIDED NEXT YEAR I WILL NOT SEEK A FIFTH  CONGRESSIONAL TERM.
THERE YOU HAVE IT, NO  FIFTH TERM. A POLITICAL CAREER OVER IN  THE BLINK OF AN EYE. WHICH FOR MICHELE BACHMANN  IS ONCE EVERY EIGHT YEARS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FOLKS, DONE WORRY. IN HER REMAINING TIME IN  OFFICE MICHELLE BACHMANN  WILL STAY FOCUSED ON HER  GOALS.
I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK  VEHEMENTLY AND ROBUSTLY TO  FIGHT BACK AGAINST WHAT MOST IN THE OTHER PARTY WANT TO  DO TO TRANSFORM OUR COUNTRY  INTO BECOMING.
YES. WE MUST FIGHT THOSE MOST  BEFORE OUR COUNTRY IS  TRANSFORMED INTO BECOMING. STUPID MOST. SO TONIGHT, FOLKS, WE SAY  GOOD-BYE TO MICHELE BACHMANN  AND LOOK FONDLY BACK AT SOME OF HER VERY MOMENTS. (LAUGHTER)
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS A  BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR  ENTITY. THEY WANT TO BECOME THE  LENSCRAFTER OF BIG ABORTION.
IT'S A VERY SAD LIFE. IT'S PART OF SATAN I THINK  TO SAY THIS IS GAY. IT'S ANYTHING BUT GAY.
LEADS TO THE PERSONAL  ENSLAVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. BECAUSE IF YOU ARE'S  INVOLVED IN THE GAY AND  LESBIAN LIFESTYLE, IT'S  BONDAGE.
THE VERY FOUNDERS THAT  WROTE THOSE DOCUMENTS WORKED  TIRELESSLY UNTIL SLAVERY WAS NO MORE IN THE UNITED  STATES.
THERE'S A WOMAN WHO CAME  UP CRYING TO ME TONIGHT  AFTER THE DEBATE. SHE SAID HER DAUGHTER WAS  GIVEN THAT VACCINE. SHE TOLD ME HER DAUGHTER  SUFFERED MENTAL RETARDATION  AS A RESULT OF THAT VACCINE.
THERE ISN'T EVEN ONE  STUDY THAT CAN BE PRODUCED  THAT SHOWS THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IS A HARMFUL GAS.
OUR FATHERS THOUGHT  TAXATION WITHOUT  REPRESENTATION WAS BAD WA,  WOULD THEY THINK OF REPRESENTATION WITH TAXATION.
I GOT TWO CUPCAKES FOR  YOU. DID YOU GET THEM. YOU WE GOT TWO CUP TAKES FOR  YOU, DID YOU GET THEM. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU LIKED  CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA. (APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I WILL MISS HER. THAT'S WHY I SENT HER TWO  FAREWELL CUP TAKES. WE SENT HER TOO, DID SHE GET  THEM DID. SHE GET THE TWO? WHAT? WHAT'S--   (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NATION, NOBODY  LIKES A KNOW IT ALL AND I  SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW ALL OF IT. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG  OF THE FINGER. FOLKS, I AM A FAMOUS PERSON  WHO I'M SURE GOOG SELL GOING  TO SEND ME THOSE GOOGLE GLASS GLASSES BUT FOLKS I'M  NOT SURE IF I EVEN WANT THEM  NOW.
GOOGLE BANNING PORN ON  ITS FUTURISTIC GLASSES.
GOOGLE SAYS PORNOGRAPHY  WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN ITS  NEW GOOGLE GLASS COMPUTER  EYEGLASSES. THE TECH GIANT MADE THE MOVE  YESTERDAY AFTER A PORN  COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW  ADULT APP.
SO A WAG OF MY FINGER AT  GOOGLE GLASS FOR BANNING  PORN. NOW THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SEE  PORN ON GOOGLE IS BY TYPING  PORN INTO GOOGLE. (LAUGHTER)  OR, OR REALLY ANYTHING INTO  GOOGLE. IT'S JUST NOT GOOD BUSINESS. I MEAN GOOGLE IS MAKING A  CAR THAT CAN DRIVE ITSELF. WHY HAVE A CAR YOU DON'T  NEED TO STEER IF YOU CAN'T  WATCH PORN WHILE IT DRIVES  YOU TO CHURCH. NOW WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO  DO WITH YOUR HANDS IN THERE. I'M TELLING YOU, I AM  TELLING YOU, THOSE HEATED  LEATHER SEATS ARE JUST A  TEASE. NEXT UP ON THE-- I LOVE  WESTERNS, THE CLASSIC  AMERICAN GENRE WHICH IS WHY  I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER AT THE LONE RANGER. JIMMY, GIVE THEM A GOOD  TASTE OF THE BAD UGLY.
THERE WERE RUMORS THAT  SUSTAINED US, STORIES OF A  MAN, A MASKED MAN. A LONE RANGER.
Stephen: YES, THE LONE  RANGER FACING OFF AGAINST  HIS NEWEST THREAT, A BULLET GENTLY LOBBED AT HIM BY A  CHILD. (LAUGHTER)  I'M SORRY, I AM SORRY BUT I  CANNOT GET BEHIND THIS  GRITTY NEW REBOOT. I'M AN ORIGINALIST AND I  BELIEVE THE LONE RANGER  SHOULD BE A CLEAN CUT  GENTLEMAN WITH A PERFECTLY CRISP LACE UP SHIRT BECAUSE  BACK IN MY DAY OUTLAWS KNEW  NOT TO [BLEEP] WITH A GUY WEARING A NECKERCHIEF.
WHOOO! (APPLAUSE)  TO MAKE THINGS WORSE N THE  ENTIRE TRAILER NOT ONCE DOES  THE LONE RANGER SAY HIS FAMOUS CATCH PHRASE HI HO  SILVER. EVEN IN THE SCENE WHERE HE  IS SAYING I HAD TO A HO WHO  IS HOLDING SILVER! (APPLAUSE)  COME ON! BUT WHAT REALLY ASSES MY  CHAFF IS THAT THE LONE  RANGER ISN'T EVEN THE STAR.
FROM THE GREAT BEYOND, A  VISION TOLD ME GREAT WARRIOR  WOULD HELP ME ON MY QUEST.
Stephen: WAIT, HIS QUEST,  TONTO'S QUEST? TONTO IS NOT THE HERO, TONTO  IS THE SIDE KICK. TONTO IS SO INCONSEQUENCE  THAT HE'S BEEN PARTNERS WITH  THIS GUY SINCE 1949 AND  PEOPLE STILL CALL HIM THE LONE RANGER. (LAUGHTER)  COME ON! (APPLAUSE)  I'M ANGRY, I'M ANGRY! AND LOOK AT THIS INJUSTICE  WHICH IS SURELY THE GREATEST  EVER TO TRANSPIRE BETWEEN A WHITE PERSON AND A NATIVE  AMERICAN.
PEOPLE THINK ARE YOU  DEAD. BETTER TO STAY THAT WAY.
YOU ONLY WEAR A MASK.
OH, GREAT IDEA. TAKE ADVICE ON CASUAL  ACCESSORIES FROM THE GUY  WITH THE DEAD CROW ON HIS  HEAD. (LAUGHTER)  FINALLY FOLKS, I PRIZE  MYSELF ON ALWAYS BEING UP ON  THE LATEST INNOVATIONS. WELL, GET READY BECAUSE THE  FUTURE IS NOW.
SEEMS THOSE NEW 3-D  PRINTERS COULD SOON BE  PRINTING YOUR DINNER. NASA IS NOW FUNDING RESEARCH  INTO 3-D PRINTED FOOD. ONE RESEARCHER IS USING THAT  GRANT MONEY TO PRINT PIZZAS.
Stephen: FANTASTIC! INSTANT PRINTED PIZZA AT THE  TOUCH OF A BUTTON. UNLIKE DOMINOES WHERE YOU  HAVE TO WAIT FOR 30 MINUTES  AND THE PIZZA ONLY TASTES LIKE IT CAME OUT OF A  PRINTER. (LAUGHTER)  SO A TIP OF MY HAT TO 3-D  PRINTED FOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DELICIOUS! FOLKS, HERE IS HOW YOUR MEAL  WILL BE EXTRUDED. THE PRINTER FIRST PRINTS A  LAYER OF DOE WHICH IS BAKED  AT THE SAME TIME IT IS  PRINTED. THEN IT LAYS DOWN A TOMATO  BASE WHICH IS ALSO STORED IN  A POWDERED FORM AND THEN MIXED WITH WATER AND OIL. FINALLY THE PIZZA IS TOPPED  WITH A PROTEIN LAYER. HMMMM. A PROTEIN LAYER. MAN, MY MOUTH IS ALREADY  FILLING WITH A SALIVA LAYER. PLUS, PLUS HOPEFULLY WE CAN  COMBINE OUR 3-D PRINTED FOOD  WITH OUR 3-D PRINTED GUNS. AND MAKE A RIFLE THAT FIRES  PIZZA ROLLS RIGHT INTO MY  FOOD HOLE. (APPLAUSE)  NOW ACCORDING TO THE FOOD  PRINTER'S CREATOR, THE  TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE THE END OF FOOD WASTE BECAUSE THE  POWDER THIS SYSTEM USES IS  SHELF STABLE FOR UP TO 30  YEARS. BUT REMEMBER, IT'S VERY  IMPORTANT, AFTER 30 YEARS  AND ONE DAY, IT TASTES  TERRIBLE. (LAUGHTER)  THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IF THERE'S  SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR  DINNER YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN TO THE WAITER, YOU HAVE TO TALK  TO ALEX FROM IT WHO IS JUST  GOING TO ROLL HIS EYES AND ASK IF YOU TRY TURNING YOUR  PERSON OMELET OFF AND ON BUT  OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE ALREADY TRIED THAT. THE PROBLEM IS THE RED  PEPPERS AREN'T COMPATIBLE  WITH WINDOWS XP. DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT? THE POINT IS, FOLKS, NASA  PRINTING PIZZAS IN ORBIT IS  THE KIND OF INNOVATION THAT SHOULD MAKE EVERY AMERICAN  PROUD. BECAUSE WHILE WE'RE DOING  THAT, AFRICANS CONDITION  EVEN GET A LOAF OF BREAD. IT'S THE ULTIMATE POWER  MOVE. HEY, SOMALIA, DON'T EAT ALL  THAT DIRT IN ONE SITTING. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, WE  GOT TO LAUNCH A CAKE INTO  THE SUN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE)
