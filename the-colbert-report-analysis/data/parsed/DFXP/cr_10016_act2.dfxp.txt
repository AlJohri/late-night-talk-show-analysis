Colbert: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!  FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW THAT I AM SO DISAPPOINTED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS. I ONLY VOTE FOR WASHINGTON OUTSIDERS BUT THE DAY THEY ARE ELECTED, WHAT DO THEY DO?  MOVE TO WASHINGTON. LUCKILY, SOME POLITICIANS STAY TRUE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. EVEN WHEN THEY GET DEVOURED IN A FEEDING FRENZY. THIS IS BLOOD IN THE WATER.
SHARK, SHARK, SHARK, SHARK. SHARK.
Colbert: RECENTLY LEARNED I AM A HUGE FAN OF NEVADA STATE ASSEMBLYMAN AND EXTRA IN A COEN BROTHERS MOVIE, JIM WHEELER. AT A RECENT REPUBLICAN PARTY MEETING WHEELER EXPLAINED HOW HE HAD RESPONDED TO A CRITIC WHO ACCUSED HIM OF BEING SO WEAK THAT IF HIS CONSTITUENTS WANTED HIM TO, HE WOULD VOTE FOR SLAVERY.
IF THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT 39 WANTED TO MAKE SLAVERY LEGAL, I WOULD VOTE FOR SLAVERY. YEAH. IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT, I WOULD HAVE TO HOLD MY NOSE AND BITE MY TONGUE AND PROBABLY HAVE TO HOLD A GUN TO MY HEAD, BUT, YEAH, IF THAT'S WHAT THE CITIZENS OF MY CONSTITUENCY WANTS WHO ELECTED ME THAT'S WHAT THEY ELECTED ME FOR, THAT'S WHAT A PUBLIC IS.
Colbert: THAT'S RIGHT WHEN WE VOTERS ELECT SOMEONE WE BECOME HIS MASTER AND HE MUST DO WHAT WE SAY UNDER THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE. THERE IS ONLY ONE WORD FOR THAT, DEMOCRACY. AND THIS MUST MAKE A HELL OF A BUMPER STICKER, JIM WHEELER, YOU WANT SLAVES, YOU GOT THEM. BUT OF COURSE, INSTEAD, INSTEAD OF SEEING JIM WHEELER AS A DEDICATED LAW MAKER THE THEY SAW HIM AS CHUM.
OTHER NEVADA LAWMAKERS ARE SPEAKING AGAINST THE COMMENTS. BRIAN SANDOVAL SAYS THOSE COMMENTS FROM WHEELER ARE DEEPLY OFFENSIVE.
THE METRO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS CALLED FOR ASSEMBLYMAN WHEEL TORE RESIGN.
THE NEVADA DEMOCRATIC PARTY CALLED WHEELER'S COMMENTS DISGUSTING AND EMBARRASSING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA.
Colbert: OH COME ON THERE IS NOTHING THAT EMBARRASS IT IS STATE OF NEVADA. THE STATE FLAG IS A MAN ON A JAZZY PUMPING NICKELS INTO A SLOT MACHINE. FOLKS, THIS IS NOTHING MORE, THINKABLE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LIBERAL HIT JOB. THE MEDIA TWISTED WHEELER'S STATEMENT ALL AROUND. AS HE MADE CLEAR ON HIS WEB SITE IN A CAREFULLY WORDING EXPLANATION, THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM ARE ABSURD TO ANYONE THAT VIEWED THE COMMENTS IN CONTEXT. EXACTLY. SO LET ME GIVE YOU THE ENTIRE CONTEXT TO CLEAR THIS UP. SOMEONE SAID THAT HE WOULD VOTE TO BRING BACK SLAVERY AND HE RESPONDED, YES, I WOULD. SEE. A LITTLE MORE, A LITTLE MORE NUANCED, ISN'T IT?  AND JUST LISTEN TO WHAT WHEELER TOLD THE EIGHT NEWS I TEAM, NEVADA'S NEWS LEADER.
WHEELER TOLD THE I TEAM HE IS PROBABLY THE LEAST BIGOTED GUY IN THE WORLD.
Colbert: YEAH, THE LEAST BIGOTED. SO MOVE OVER DESMOND TUTU BECAUSE THERE IS NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN AND HE IS WILLING TO ENSLAVE YOU. SO YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW, FOLKS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: COME TO THINK OF IT, FOLKS, HIS CRITICS ARE REALLY THE RACISTS. FOR ASSUMING THAT JIM WHEELER MEANS BLACK SLAVERY. MAYBE HE WOULD VOTE TO ENSLAVE LATINOS OR YOUNG GREEK BOYS OR WHITE PEOPLE. HE WILL ENSLAVE ANYONE YOU WANT. HELL, IF JIM WHEELER'S VOTERS WANT TO SELL THEIR BLONDE DAUGHTERS TO MALAYSIAN DRUG LORDS THAT IS JOB ONE. SO I AM CALLING ON ASSEMBLYMAN'S CONSTITUENTS TO JUST PROVE HOW DEDICATED THIS MAN IS. START A PETITION CALLING ON JIM WHEEL TORE PUNCH HIMSELF IN THE BALLS. I MEAN, A SOLID NUT PUNCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Colbert: NOT ONE OF THOSE KNUCKLE GLANCERS, THE CONSTITUENTS DEMAND A REAL WIND UP JUNK STUNNER. ASSEMBLYMAN, YOU DO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND I GUARANTEE YOU THAT YOUTUBE VIDEO WILL GET A LOT MORE LIKES THAN YOUR SLAVERY ONE. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
