BACK, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANKS, FOLKS. NATION, AS OF 8:00 EASTERN  STANDARD TIME, IT APPEARS THE  MANHUNT FOR CALIFORNIA FUGITIVE CHRIS DORNER IS COMING TO A  CLOSE. HIS STORY IS YET ANOTHER IN A  LONG SERIES OF TRAGIC  GUN-RELATED DEATHS. AND SO FAR, NOTHING HAS BEEN  DONE TO CURB OUR ACCESS TO THESE  DEADLY WEAPONS. AND HOPEFULLY, THAT NOTHING WILL  CONTINUE. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOR THOSE FRUSTRATED THAT  NOT ENOUGH OF NOTHING IS BEING  DONE, I HAVE GOOD NEWS: IT'S A BOLD NEW INITIATIVE  IN ARIZONA, WHERE SHERIFF JOE  ARPAIO IS SENDING 3,000 VOLUNTEERS TO PATROL SCHOOLS IN  ARMED POSSES, AND THE TRAINING  STARTED THIS WEEKEND.
INSIDE THIS ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS  DON'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST HEAVILY ARMED GUNMEN. THE KIDS COWER UNDER THE TABLES,  TRY TO ESCAPE AS TEACHERS BEG  THE BAD GUYS FOR MERCY. THE VOLUNTEER POSSE MEMBERS TAKE  THE GUNMAN DOWN.
Stephen: WOW. [LAUGHTER] ARIZONA'S GOT GREAT SCHOOLS. THOSE ARE 8th GRADERS, BUT  THEY'RE BEING TRAUMATIZED AT A  12th GRADE LEVEL! [LAUGHTER] NOW, FILLING OUR SCHOOLS WITH  GUN-TOTING GUYS WHO HAVE NOWHERE  TO BE DURING WORK HOURS MIGHT GIVE SOME PARENTS PAUSE, BUT  REST ASSURED, MOM AND DAD, THESE  VOLUNTEER POSSES ARE GETTING TOP NOTCH TRAINING.
THESE VOLUNTEER OFFICERS ARE  RUNNING THROUGH DRILLS RUN BY  HOLLYWOOD ACTOR STEVEN SEAGAL. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YES, STEVEN SEAGAL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT CAN  STOP A BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS AN  EVEN WORSE ACTOR. [LAUGHTER] WE KNOW HOLLYWOOD VIOLENCE IS  THE REAL PROBLEM, THEREFORE IT'S  ALSO THE SOLUTION. [LAUGHTER] IT'S LIKE FIGHTING FIRE WITH  FIRE. IF YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE, CALL  AN ARSONIST, HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO  DO. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOR SOME REASON ARIZONA  DEMOCRAT CHAD CAMPBELL CALLED  USING SEAGAL AS AN INSTRUCTOR "LUDICROUS."  ADDING, "WHY DON'T WE ALSO HAVE  CLINT EASTWOOD AND CHUCK NORRIS  AND BRUCE WILLIS COME OUT AND TRAIN THEM TOO WHILE WE'RE AT  IT?" [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL, COME ON! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS STUPID. YOU CAN'T HAVE THOSE GUYS. THEY STILL GET WORK. [LAUGHTER] BESIDES, NONE OF THESE GUYS HAVE  LAMA SEAGAL'S MASTERY OF  TACTICAL OPS.
I'VE PUT HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF  HOURS INTO MY WEAPONS TRAINING.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,  MILLIONS OF HOURS! [LAUGHTER] NOW A MILLION HOURS IS ABOUT 115  YEARS, WHICH SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT  SO DOES ASKING STEVEN SEGAL TO TRAIN YOUR POSSE. SO IT WORKS OUT. [LAUGHTER] THE SEAGAL POSSE IS SUCH A  PRE-SUCCESS THAT ARAPAIO'S  ALREADY SIGNED ON ADDITIONAL STAR POWER-- 1970'S "THE  INCREDIBLE HULK" STAR LOU  FERRIGNO AND ACTOR PETER LUPUS OF THE 1960S TV SERIES "MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, LUPUS IS 80 NOW. SO MISSION IMPOSSIBLE IS OPENING  THE LUNCHROOM MILK. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOLKS, MANY OF ARPAIO'S  POSSE MEMBERS DON'T EVEN NEED  TRAINING. HISTORY HAS PROVEN THEY'VE GOT  EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH  POLICE.
A SIX-MONTH CBS5  INVESTIGATION UNCOVERED A NUMBER  OF POSSE MEMBERS WITH ARRESTS FOR ASSAULT, DRUG POSSESSION,  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEX CRIMES  AGAINST CHILDREN, DISORDERLY CONDUCT, IMPERSONATING AN  OFFICER, AND THE LIST GOES ON."
Stephen: WOW. DRUG POSSESSION? SEX CRIMES? IT TAKES REAL DEDICATION TO  GUARD A SCHOOL THAT YOU ARE NOT  ALLOWED WITHIN 500 FEET OF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET  ALL WORRIED ABOUT HAVING  ARPAIO'S VIOLENT SEX OFFENDERS WATCH THEIR KIDS. NO PROBLEM. HE CAN JUST ASSEMBLE AN ARMED  POSSE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN  FROM HIS OTHER ARMED-VOLUNTEER  POSSE. [LAUGHTER] I BET WE CAN EVEN GET STEVEN  SEAGAL TO TRAIN THAT POSSE, TOO,  IF SOMEONE JUST SHOWS UP WITH A CAMERA AND A SWEET ROLL. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
