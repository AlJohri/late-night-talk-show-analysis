Stephen:  MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS WRITTEN AND STARS IN THE FILM "DON JON." SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY SHOULD WIN AN OSCAR FOR TRYING TOO HARD. PLEASE WELCOME JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NICE TO SEE YOU. WHAT A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE ON THIS SHOW. I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW. I THINK YOU DO A SERVICE TO PUT THIS OUT IN THE WORLD. SO THANK YOU.
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I LOVE YOUR SHOW.
Stephen:  YOU ARE-- YOU'RE ONE OF THE HEROES.
THANKS, MAN.
Stephen:  JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT, YOU'RE AN ACTOR, DIRECTOR, WRITER, PRODUCER. YOUR CREDITS INCLUDE, "ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD" "10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT OW," "THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN" "500 DAYS OF SUMMER." THE OF "THE DARK KNIGHT RISES." YOUR NEW FILM IS CALLED "DON JON."
CORRECT.
Stephen? "DON JON" YOU PLAY A GUY WHO HAS TROUBLE RELATED TO WOMEN?
HES DOES DOES. HE HAS TROUBLE RELATING TO EVERYTHING. HE DOESN'T CONNECT WITH ANYBODY. HIS WHOLE LIFE IS SORT OF A ONE-WE STREET, AND YOU SEE IT ESPECIALLY WITH HIS LOVE LIFE AND SEX LIFE BECAUSE HE'S CONSTANTLY COMPARING WOMEN TO THE IMAGES HE SEES ON TV AND MOVIES AND ESPECIALLY IN PORNOGRAPHY.
Stephen:  ESPECIALLY IN PORNOGRAPHY VIDEOS. THIS TAPE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL AN UNVARNISHED LOOK AT THIS CHARACTER'S RELATIONSHIP TO PORNOGRAPHY.
INDEED. THEN THERE'S THE SCARLET JOHANNSEN CHARACTER WHO ALSO WATCHES TOO MANY ROMANTIC HOLLYWOOD MOVIES. SO YOU HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION OF WHAT LOVE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND SEX IS SUPPOSE TO BE.
Stephen:  I THINK WE HAVE A CLIP. JIMMY.
ALL RIGHT, I HAD A FEW DRINKS THE OTHER NIGHT, SO I MAY NOT HAVE REMEMBERED TELLING YOU MY FIRST NAME, BUT I DEFINITELY DID NOT TELL YOU MY LAST NAME. DON'T LIE TO ME. LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW ME, SO I'LL LET YOU OFF THE HOOK THIS TIME. BUT IN THE FUTURE, YOU'LL BE HAPPIER IF YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.
I'LL BE HAPPIER?
YOU DON'T THINK I COULD MAKE YOU HAPPIER IF I WANTED TO?
Stephen:  THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE SOFTEST PORN I HAVE EVER SEEN, EXTRA SOFT. THIS IS A GUY WHO CAN'T FIND A WOMAN HE CAN REALLY RELATE TO, WHICH IS ALWAYS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE EVEN WHEN HE IS HAVING SEX WITH A WOMAN BECAUSE HE'S LIKE THERE ISN'T LIKE THE PORNO I JUST SAW.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A CLIP OF PORNOGRAPHY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PERSON.
Stephen:  I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I WOULDN'T KNOW, EITHER.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE TO SAY-- PORNOGRAPHY MASTURBATES TO ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, SO HE'S JUST--
Stephen:
PEOPLE MASTURBATE TO ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  YOU SHOULD PUT THAT ON A BUSINESS CARD. WAIT, YOU'VE GOT THESE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS. AND-- YOU'RE AN ACTOR, THOUGH. OKAY. YOU'VE BEEN AN ACTOR SINCE HOW OLD?
SINCE I WAS SIX.
Stephen:  SINCE YOU WERE SIX YEARS OLD. OUR IMAGES THAT WE GET FROM HOLLYWOOD, NONE OF THEM ARE REALISTIC.
THEY'RE CRAFTED ILLUSIONS TO TELL A STORY.
Stephen:  ANOTHER ALL RIGHT. SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE PORNOKRAPHY OR ROMANTIC COMEDY. ISN'T EVERYTHING GIVING US A FALSE VIEW OF REAL LIFE?
I AGREE. LIKE I SAID, THE SCARLET JOHAWNSEN CHARACTER IS WATCHING A ROMANTIC HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. THERE IS A SCENE AT THE DINNER TABLE WHERE TONY DANZA IS PLAYING MY DAD-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FROM TONY DANS DANZA AND WE'RE WATCHING A MOVIE WHERE A HOT CHICK IS EATING A HAMBURGER AND PEOPLE ASK ME, IS THAT A REAL COMPLECIAL? IT IS A REAL COMMERCIAL.
Stephen:  HASN'T YOUR CAREER DONE THE SAME THING.
EXPLOITED --
Stephen:  WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT THE REAL JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT? I MEAN, TO I HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF WHO ARE YOU?
PROBABLY.
Stephen:  BECAUSE I IMAGINE YOU AS A YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE GUY, WHO LOOKS GOOD SHOOTING A GUN AND DATING ZOE DESCHNEL. WITH WHICH ROLES HAVE YOU PLAYED IS CLOSEST TO THE REAL YOU? AND PLEASE DON'T SAY THE GUY IN "DON JON."
YES, PROBABLY NOT THAT ONE. I WOULD-- I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS A MOVIE CALLED "BRICK" THAT REMINDED ME OF ME A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S A HIGHLY STYLIZED DETECTIVE MOVIE SO I DON'T BE WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT ME. BUT, NO, IT'S TRUE. LOOK, WHEN I'M PLAYING A CHARACTER I AM LOOKING TO TRY TO TELL A STORY AND MAKE A CONNECTION WITH THE AUDIENCE WHO IS WATCHING THE MOVIE. IN A PORNOGRAPHY CLIP OR OTHER MOVIE OR COMMERCIALS THEY'RE NOT REALLY TRYING TO CONNECT WITH AN AUDIENCE SO MUCH AS TAKE THEIR MONEY.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT WHAT I ADMIRE ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY. IT IS A SOUND BUSINESS MOD GLEL DID YOU EVER WATCH PORN EVER?
Stephen:  I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALK ABOUT. I HEAR GREAT THINGS. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU LEARN WHAT MAKES A WOMAN SEXY?
Stephen:  THE BIBLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  I'M NOT AN ACTOR. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. AS AN ACTOR, YOUR CHARACTER BESIDES ALL THESE IMAGES OF JUSTIFICATION OF WOMEN IN THE REAL WORLD, YOUR CHARACTER MASTURBATES A LOT TO INTERNET PORN. HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET INTO CHARACTER? ( LAUGHTER ) AND ARE YOU IN CHARACTER RIGHT NOW?
Stephen:  THIS SPEAKS TO SOMETHING IN COMEDY CALLED SATIRE WHICH I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT. BUT IN THE WORLD OF COMEDY, YOU HAVE A TECHNIQUE CALLED SATIRE WHERE I'M PLAYING A CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ME. AND THE THING THAT THE CHARACTER SAYS AND DOES AND BELIEVES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE THINGS I SAY AND DO AND BELIEVE. AND I PUT THOSE THINGS IN THE MOVIE AND TRY TO GET THE AUDIENCE TO LAUGH AND THINK ABOUT THINGS. NOT THAT YOU WOULD-- I'M EXPLAINING IT TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE A SERIOUS JOURNALIST. BUT THAT'S HOW WE DO IT IN SHOW BUSINESS.
Stephen:  I DID NOT FOLLOW. HAVE YOU MET FLOYD MAY WEATHER?
NO I HAVE NEVER MET HIM BEFORE.
Stephen:  GO BACKSTAGE AND TAKE A POKE AT HIM?
I'M BIGGER THAN HE IS, ACTUALLY, I THINK.
Stephen:  CAN I COME BACK AND WATCH?
Stephen:  JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. THE MOVIE IS "DON JON." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. CLN
