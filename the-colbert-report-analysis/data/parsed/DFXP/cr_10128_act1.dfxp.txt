Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE COLBERT REPORT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN MP3 FILE, BUT I  GOTTA SAY IT AGAIN, BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF  TO BE PRESIDENT. AND I'M BEGINNING TO THINK HE AGREES BECAUSE HE'S STARTED DOING SOMETHING FAR WORSE THAN DESTROYING AMERICA. HE'S SLACKING OFF AT DESTROYING AMERICA.
THIS WEEK PRESIDENT OBAMA REFUSING TO GO TO THE U.S.-MEXICAN BORDER. BUT GUESS WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS PLANNING TO GO? ON VACATION. NEWS TODAY THAT OBAMA WILL HEAD BACK TO RITZY MARTHA'S VINEYARD NEXT MONTH.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SPENT THREE DAYS AVOIDING A VISIT TO THE BORDER WHILE PLAYING POOL, SIPPING BEERS AND RAISING LOTS OF MONEY.
WAKE UP, AMERICA. WE ELECTED A PRESIDENT WHO'D RATHER PLAY POOL AND DRINK BEER IN COLORADO THAN ADDRESS THE AMERICAN CRISIS DEVELOPING AT OUR BORDER.
Stephen: YES, WHILE AMERICA BURNS, PRESIDENT NERO IS FIDDLING ON VACATION IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD, SHOOTING POOL IN COLORADO, AND DOWN AT DISNEY WORLD, HE'S JUST HANGING AROUND GIVING THE SAME DAMN SPEECH ALL DAY LONG. MUST BE NICE. AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE DID ON HIS LATEST TRIP TO EUROPE. PETER JOHNSON, JR., BREAK IT DOWN FOR US.
THE SALON SOCIETY OF THE 17th AND 18th CENTURY OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT HAS COME TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TO THE WHITE HOUSE. WE KNOW AS SOON AS HE STEPPED OFF THE PLANE IN ROME, ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES," HE ASKED THE AMBASSADOR, "LET'S HAVE A DINNER PARTY." WE CAN DISCUSS ART, ARCHITECTURE, THE ENLIGHTENMENT.
HE'S BRAINSTORMING. WONDERFUL.
Stephen: YES, WONDERFUL! OOH! THE ENLIGHTENMENT! THE 17th AND 18th CENTURY INTELLECTUAL REVOLUTION THAT BELIEVED THAT KNOWLEDGE IS WORTH ACQUIRING AND THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS SUPERIOR TO SUPERSTITION AND LEACH CRAFT. OH, GARCON! BRING US PASTEURIZED MILK AND VACCINES SO WE CAN ALL LIVE PAST THE AGE OF 30! LA-DEE-DAA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, IT'S CLEAR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THE PRESIDENT HAS SENIORITIS. HE'S IN THE LAST TWO SEMESTERS OF HIS PRESIDENCY, AND HE'S TOTALLY CHECKED OUT. TOSSING BACK BEERS, LATE NIGHT BULL SESSIONS WITH FRIENDS, TRAVELING ACROSS EUROPE, AND IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE, SIR. IT MAY SEEM LIKE FUN TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND FIND YOURSELF ABROAD, BUT, TRUST ME, IT NEVER WORKS OUT THE WAY YOU HOPE IT WILL. YOU'RE TRAVELING AROUND WITH YOUR BUDDY -- LET'S CALL HIM TED -- AND YOU KNOW, YOU GET STUCK FOR 12 HOURS ON THE BORDER BETWEEN FRANCE AND ITALY BECAUSE OF A RAIL STRIKE, AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY FOR FOOD, ALL YOU'VE GOT ARE TWO BOTTLES OF WINE, BUT NO WINE OPENER, BUT YOU MEET TWO CUTE GIRLS FROM THE RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN IN THE NEXT CAR WHO DO HAVE A CORKSCREW AND YOU SPEND ALL NIGHT DRINKING WITH NO FOOD, SO ALL FOUR OF YOU ARE FEELING PRETTY GOOD AND DECIDE TO TRAVEL TO PISA TOGETHER, WHERE YOU ALL SHARE ONE BIG ROOM AND THINGS ARE LOOKING POSITIVE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, EXCEPT SARAH WON'T GO FOR A WALK WITH TED SO YOU CAN BE ALONE WITH BRIDGET. EVEN THOUGH IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT BRIDGET IS OPEN TO IT. AT MINIMUM, WE'RE TALKING TONGUE, BIG TIME. I MEAN, EVEN BRIDGET IS TRYING TO GET SARAH TO TAKE A WALK -- JUST AROUND THE BLOCK -- BUT, NO, SARAH IS ROOTED TO THE GROUND LIKE A GOD DAMN OAK. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) AND THE MOMENT PASSES, AND IT WILL HAUNT YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. SO, MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TURN IN THE EURRAIL PASS, COME HOME, BUCKLE DOWN AND HIT THE BOOKS BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, YOU ONLY HAVE TWO YEARS LEFT BEFORE GRADUATION BECAUSE YOU AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN F IN ECON. FOLKS, I DON'T FRIGHTEN EASY AND I DON'T KNOW WHY, AND THAT SCARES ME. THIS IS THE THREATDOWN! (SIRENS) ALL BEAR EDITION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, LONG-TIME VIEWERS WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY WILL KNOW THAT I AM NO FAN OF BEARS -- BROWN, BLACK, GUMMY, EVEN CHARMIN. I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TRUST SOME MURDEROUS GRIZZLY WITH THE CLEANING OF MY BATHING SUIT AREAS. I WILL DRAG MY BUTT ALONG THE GRASS LIKE GOD INTENDED. BUT RECENTLY, THESE BERNSTEIN BRUTES INFILTRATED OUR MOST SACRED INSTITUTION.
ONE WILD ANIMAL THINKS HE DESERVES THE COMFORT OF THE HOME.
CHECK OUT THE BEAR IN MY NEIGHBOR'S YARD ON HIS HAMMOCK.
DAYTONA BEACH HOME OWNER VINCENT JAMES SNAPPED THESE PHOTOS TO PROVE THAT, YES, A BEAR WAS NAPPING IN HIS HAMMOCK. JAMES SAYS THE BEAR HAD BEEN RUMMAGING THROUGH THE TRASHCANS, THEN CLIMBED INTO THE HAMMOCK "LIKE HE WAS A TOURIST OR SOMETHING."
Stephen: YES, A TOURIST! OR SOMETHING! IT'S ALL IN THE BEAR'S GUIDE BOOK -- "LET'S GO:  EAT CHILDREN." FRANKLY, I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING WORSE THAN A BEER IN A HAMMOCK, EXCEPT A BEAR IN A BANANA HAMMOCK. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER THREE -- LEISURE-TIME BEARS! FOLKS, DON'T BE FOOLED -- THAT BEAR IS NOT USING A HAMMOCK TO RELAX. HOW STRESSFUL CAN BEING A BEAR BE? "I NEED THAT SALMON ON MY DESK IN 15 MINUTES, OR YOU'RE FIRED FROM THE FOREST!" NO! THEY'RE JUST LAYING IN WAIT, FOLKS. HERE'S THEIR PLAN:  IT'S THE END OF THE WORKDAY, YOU WANT TO RELAX SO YOU GRAB A MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE, CRANK THE BUFFETT AND JUMP IN YOUR HAMMOCK. SUDDENLY, INSTEAD OF CHEESEBURGER IN PARADISE, IT'S MAN-BERGER IN BEAR-A-DISE! TRADEMARK! RETURN MY CALLS, WEIRD AL. NATION, BEARS WILL STOP AT NOTHING UNTIL THEY'VE TURNED OUR SUMMER FUN INTO THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS. SO TAKE PRECAUTIONS. MAKE SURE THERE'S NO BEAR AT THE END OF YOUR SLIP AND SLIDE, OR IN THE BACK OF YOUR TANDEM BIKE, OR THAT THE SHARK AT THE BEACH ISN'T JUST A BEER IN A SHARK SUIT. OKAY? THAT HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED. THAT IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. AND FOLKS, HAMMOCKS AREN'T THE ONLY AMERICAN LEISURE ACTIVITIES BEARS HAVE THEIR EYES ON BECAUSE OVER A SIX-YEAR PERIOD AT CROATIA'S KUTEREVO BEAR REFUGE, RESEARCHERS REPORTED MULTIPLE ACTS OF FELLATIO BETWEEN TWO MALE BEARS. THAT'S RIGHT. THESE COUNTRY BEARS ARE HAVING A JAMBOREE. BUT THAT'S NO JUG THEY'RE BLOWING ON. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THREAT NUMBER TWO. GAY BEARS! I HAVE LONG FEARED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE TWO GREATEST THREATS TO AMERICA EVER TEAMED UP. IF THIS GOES ANY FURTHER, WE COULD END UP WITH A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF GAY MEN PATTERNING THEMSELVES AFTER THESE ANIMALS. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE! THIS IS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE! RESEARCHERS SAW SMOKEY THE POLE-SMOKER OVER HERE ENGAGE IN 28 ACTS OF FELLATIO OVER 116 HOURS, AVERAGING ONE ACT FOR EVERY FOUR HOURS. TRULY TERRIFYING. I HAD NO IDEA BEARS HAD THAT MANY BIRTHDAYS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES SCIENTISTS TELL YOU TO CLAP TO SCARE THE BEARS AWAY. FINALLY, I BRING YOU THE MOST TERRIFYING BEAR IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PROGRAM. MEET PYROS, A BROWN BEAR LIVING IN THE PYRENEES MOUNTAINS. YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL A EUROPEAN BEAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T SHAVE THEIR ARM PITS. PYROS IS NOT ONLY A VICIOUS MAN EATER, HE'S A VORACIOUS LADYKILLER BECAUSE PYROS IS FATHER, GRANDFATHER OR GREAT GRANDFATHER TO NEARLY ALL OF THE CUBS BORN IN THE REGION OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. CAN'T BLAME THE LADIES. JUST LOOK AT HIM. THAT THICK COAT. THAT BROAD MUZZLE. THAT HIGH ZYGOMATIC ARCH. I MEAN, TRANQUILIZER GUN TO MY HEAD? SURE. PLUS, PYROS' SEXUAL PROWESS NOW MEANS THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OTHER MALES, WITH JUST ONE NOT RELATED TO HIM... CAUSING A HUGE RISK OF INBREEDING. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE NUMBER ONE THREAT FACING AMERICA: PYROS THE BEER... FOR CHANGING MY HEART ABOUT BEARS. BECAUSE I WAS MOVED WHEN I LEARNED THAT PYROS IS "FACING CASTRATION FOR HIS PROMISCUITY." CASTRATION? IS THAT NECESSARY? DID THEY EVEN TRY ABSTINENCE-ONLY EDUCATION? YOU SEE, FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED BEARS WERE GODLESS KILLING MACHINES. BUT PYROS' STORY OF LOST LOVE -- AND PERHAPS LOST GONADS  GIVES ME PAUSE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SEE THAT BEARS AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. HUGE BALLS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS BEAR GETS ME RIGHT HERE. THIS IS WHERE MY BALLS START. I SEE MYSELF IN PYROS. I ALSO SEE PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY ALL THREE OF US ARE ALPHA MALES WHO, ACCORDING TO PAPA BEAR'S BOOK THE O'REILLY FACTOR, "HAVE DATED HUNDREDS OF WOMEN," AND BIG GOVERNMENT WANTS TO BRING US DOWN WITH A SHARP PAIR OF SACK-CLIPPERS. MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLKS,  MINE WOULD BE QUITE THE FEATHER IN OBAMA'S CAP! AND, YES, MINE HAVE FEATHERS. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY, RUN, PYROS! RUN FOR ALL OF US! DON'T LET THEM HAVE YOUR MAGNIFICENT MAN-SACK! YOU HEAR ME? YOU GET OUT OF HERE! WAIT... WHAT'S HE DOING? OH, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE RIGHT NOW NOW'S NOT REALLY THE TIME. OH, WELL. AT LEAST HE'S HAPPY. SAVER THEM WHILE YOU CAN, MY FRIEND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
