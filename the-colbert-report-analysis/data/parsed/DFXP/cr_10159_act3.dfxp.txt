Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, WE'RE HONORED TO BE HERE TONIGHT WITH DR. WILLIAM COSBY. DR. COSBY.
YES.
Stephen: DR. COSBY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: WHAT A PLEASURE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: NOW I WILL-- I AM GOING TO SAY SOMETHING CONTROVERSIAL. I THINK YOU'RE GREAT. YOU'RE A COMEDY LEGEND. YOU'VE GOT EMMIES, YOU'VE GOT GRAMMYS, YOU'VE GOT BOOKS. EVERYBODY LOVES BILL COSBY. YOU ARE-- THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP. THE COLBERT BUMP IS ONCE YOU'VE BEEN ON MY SHOW THINGS GET BIG FOR YOU. WILL YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET TOMORROW, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO THAT'S BILL COSBY, I SAW HIM ON COLBERT. BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING CALLED-- THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE COSBY EFFECT. YOU BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER OF DISPARATE BACKGROUNDS TO ENJOY YOUR WORK. FOR INSTANCE, LIKE NELSON MANDELA, WHEN HE WAS IN JAIL, HE AND HIS JAILERS BOTH WATCHED THE COSBY SHOW. IN THE '80s IT HELPED WITH THE RECONCILIATION THERE. WHY ISN'T MORGAN FREEMAN PLAYING YOU IN A MOVIE? (APPLAUSE)
WELL, OUT OF RESPECT MORGAN AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON THE ELECTRIC COMPANY.
Stephen: I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER.
SO-- I THINK OUT OF RESPECT MORGAN IS WAITING FOR ME TO DIE.
Stephen: YOU SEE.
Stephen: DID HE EVER CALL YOU UP AND SAY, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >>.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT HE'S ASKED HOW SYDNEY IS DOING, POTTIER.
Stephen: HARRY BELLEFONTE.
EVERYBODY, HE WANTS TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE ALL DOING. AND HE'S NOT A HAPPY MAN. NOT A HAPPY MAN. WELL, SOMETIMES, ON THE INTERNET, SOMEBODY WILL POST THAT I DIED.
Stephen: HOW DOES THAT FEEL, HOW DOES THAT FEEL TO HEAR?
WELL, NO, NO, MORGAN CALLS.
.
Stephen: I SEE.
AND I HAVE A MACHINE UPON MY DESK, IF YOU CALL, IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M ANSWERING. SO IT WILL GO TO THE FOURTH RING, HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING? AND THEN YOU'LL SAY HELLO?
STOP SAYING HELLO, WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN. SO THEN THAT FOOLS A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT MORGAN IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I AGREE, I AGREE. MR. COSBY, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR BEING HERE.
YES, YOU CAN.
Stephen: I CAN? I CAN? TELL ME WHEN I GET THERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET ME TRY, LET ME TRY TO THANK YOU AND SEE IF I GET THERE.
SEE, YOU ARE WEARING IT OUT.
Stephen: OH I WANT TO YOU REMEMBER WHEREVER YOU GO.
Stephen: YES.
WHATEVER JOB YOU HAVE.
Stephen: YES.
YOU HAVE A DESK AND A MIC, AND TWO CHAIRS. CALL ME. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BILL COSBY. (APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
