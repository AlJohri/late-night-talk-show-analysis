WELCOME BACK, THANKS SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY FIRST SHOW OF 2014, AND IN THIS NEW YEAR ALL OF US ARE MAKING NEW AREA'S RESOLUTIONS. PERSONALLY I JOINED A GYM-BORE. I USUALLY DO SIX REPS OF PARACHUTES AND TWO SETS OF BOUNCEY BALL FCHLOE IS NOT HOGGING IT. I'M COOLING DOWN HERE, CHLOE, LET ME WORK IN. BUT FOLKS, WHILE I'M OUT THERE GETTING SKINNY, AMERICA'S DEVIANTS ARE ROLLING A FATTIE, JIM?
SOME COLORADOANS HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE ON JANUARY 1st. COLORADO BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO ALLOW THE SALE OF MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL USE AND HUNDREDS LINED UP TO GET IT.
$1 MILLION OF RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA REPORTEDLY SOLD THERE ON WEDNESDAY ALONE.
Stephen: A MILLION DOLLARS OF POT IN ONE DAY. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A FULL NELSON. NATION, THIS NEWS, THIS NEWS NAUSEATED ME SO MUCH THAT I MIGHT QUALIFIED FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA. CAN SOMEONE CHECK ON THAT. YOU CAN GET ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AMERICA'S MORAL CORPS IS BEING GUTTED AND THE REST OF OUR MORAL APPLE IS BEING MADE INTO A BONG. HOW DARE, HOW DARE COLORADOANS SPEND JANUARY 1st RUINING THEIR BODIES WITH WEED WHEN THEY SHOULD BE AT HOME VOMITING ALL THE BOOZE FROM NEW YEAR'S EVE LIKE GOD INTENDED. AND THANKFULLY--  (APPLAUSE) YES. WE HAVE SOME VOMIT FANS HERE TONIGHT THANKFULLY SOME PATRIOTS ARE STANDING UP AN THEY'RE NOT JUST IGNORANT BUZZ KILLS THEY'RE EXPERIENCED BUZZ KILLS LIKE "NEW YORK TIMES" COLUMNIST DAVID BROOKS WHO WROTE FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN MY TEENAGE YEARS MY FRIENDS AND I SMOKED MARIJUANA. IT WAS FUN. I HAVE SOME FOND MEMORIES OF US ALL BEING SILLY TOGETHER. I THINK THOSE MOMENTS OF UNINHIBITIED FROLIC DEEPENED OUR FRIENDSHIP. YES. DAVID BROOKS GOT HIGH. WHICH LEAD TO UNINHIBITIED FROLIC. SOMETIMES IT BORDERED ON UNSTRUCTURED MERIMENT, EVEN UNFETTERED JOCULARITY. BUT THIS COLUMN WAS MORE THAN JUST ESTABLISHING HIS STONE-COLD STREET CRED. HE ALSO RAPPED SOME POSITIVE YOUTH MESSAGING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF LEGALLIZATION SAYING I THINK BEING STONED IS NOT A PARTICULARLY UPLIFTING FORM OF PLEASURE AND SHOULD BE DISCOVERAGED MORE THAN ENCOURAGED. AND THAT COLORADO IS NURTURING A MORAL ECOLOGY IN WHICH IT IS A BIT HARDER TO BE THE SORT OF PERSON MOST OF US WANT TO BE. SO LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU KIDS. YOU KEEP SMOKING WEED, YOU KEEP RAPPING WITH YOUR FRIENDS, YOU'LL NEVER GROW UP TO BE DAVID BROOKS. AND DAVID'S NOT THE ONLY FORMER POT HEAD WHO WANTS TO KEEP WEED ILLEGAL. SO DOES "THE WASHINGTON POST" RUTH MARCUS WHO WROTE IN AN OP ED, OUR KIDS WILL NOT BE BETTER OFF WITH ANOTHER LEGAL MIND ALTERING SUBSTANCE. WELL SAID. KIDS DON'T NEED ANOTHER LEGAL MIND ALTERING SUBSTANCE, IN SCHOOL WITH THEIR ATEROL. AND LIKE BROOKS, FOLKS, RUTH ADMITS TO BEING MORE THAN JUST ROOMMATES WITH HER FRIEND MARY JANE CONFESSING I HAVE DONE MY SHARE OF INHALING. NEXT TIME I'M IN COLORADO I EXPECT I WILL CHECK OUT SOME BUBBA KUSH. WHY NOT. WHY NOT. OTHER THAN THE COLUMN YOU JUST WROTE. I APPLAUD MARCUS AND BROOKS FOR TAKE A STIRM STANCE AGAINST LEGALIZING THE POT THEY SMOKED. I ASSUME THEY'RE GOING TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO THE POLICE NOW AND SERVE THEIR KIND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL KEEP THEM FROM EVER SMOKING AGAIN BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET HIGH AND WRITE SOMETHING REALLY CONFUSING. WELL AN RIGHT BACK
