Stephen: TONIGHT, CAN MILITARY ACTION SOLVE  THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS. WELL IT'S CERTAINLY ALLEVIATED THE GLOBAL RUBBLE SHORTAGE. THEN, A SURPRISING ALLY IN THE WAR ON TERROR. MEET THE FAMILY BLACK SHEEP BRIAN BIN LADEN. AND MY GUEST, WALTER MISCHEL, SAYS THE KEY TO SUCCESS IS THE PATIENCE TO DELAY GRATIFICATION. OOH! I WANT SOME DELAYED GRATIFICATION NOW! ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A NEW MEXICO POLICE OFFICER CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A GHOST ON A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. BUT HE LET IT GO BECAUSE IT WAS WHITE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, FOLKS-- YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO. YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF ATTORNEY GENERAL AND GUY WHO LIKES WHAT HE SEES ERIC HOLDER. WELL, TODAY WE FOUND OUT THAT NOT ONLY IS HE A JACK-BOOTED THUG, BUT IT TURNS OUT HE'S ALSO A QUITTER.
BREAKING NEWS. A MAJOR DEPARTURE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CABINET. ERIC HOLDER, THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE CABINET TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE TODAY HE IS LEAVING THE POST.
YES, OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY IS SINKING SO FAST, EVEN HIS FRIEND WON'T STICK AROUND. AND I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE OF HOLDER ESCAPING THE COLLAPSING OBAMA REGIME IN THE NICK OF TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GOTTA SAY, I'M WITH MITCH McCONNELL HERE. THIS IS VERY EXCITING. HOLDER WILL BE LEAVING IN 2015, BUT SO FAR, NO REPLACEMENT HAS BEEN NAMED. SO TONIGHT, I HUMBLY OFFER. MY SERVICES AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") NOW, FOLKS, I HEAR YOUR CALL. FULL DISCLOSURE-- I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY, BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD AT THINGS IN GENERAL. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'M A QUICK LEARNER WHEN IT COMES TO LEGAL MATTERS. ONE TIME, I FELL ASLEEP DURING A "LAW AND ORDER" MARATHON AND WOKE UP KNOWING THE WORD "JURISPRUDENCE." IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. AND AS OUR NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL, MY THIRST FOR JUSTICE WILL NOT BE SLAKED UNTIL WE SOLVE COLD CASES LIKE THE UNTIMELY DEATH LAST FEBRUARY OF CELBRATED WEATHER-PREDICTING GROUNDHOG, STATEN ISLAND CHUCK. HE'LL BE FOREVER REMEMBERED IN OUR HEARTS AS THE ONE THAT WASN'T PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE NOW A STARTLING NEW REVELATION HAS COME TO LIGHT THAT SUGGESTS CHUCK'S DEATH MAY HAVE BEEN... MURDER!  ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHY ARE WE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS NOW? BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THIS GRISLY TALE OF RODENTICIDE GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND, THEN BACK DOWN A FEW RUNGS TO THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY. JIM?
THE NEW YORK POST IS REPORTING THE GROUNDHOG, HOISTED INTO THE AIR AND DROPPED BY MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO IN FEBRUARY, DIED FROM INTERNAL INJURIES A WEEK AFTER THE GROUNDHOG DAY FESTIVITIES.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, STATEN ISLAND CHUCK DIED AFTER BILL DEBLASIO DROPPED HIM. OF COURSE, CHUCK HAD BEEN DROPPED BY A MAYOR BEFORE, BUT BUT THAT WAS MAYOR BLOOMBERG, SO HE ONLY FELL A FEW INCHES. NOW, AT THE TIME, IT SEEMED LIKE AN ACCIDENT, BUT THINK ABOUT IT: STATEN ISLAND IS THE ONLY BOROUGH THAT DEBLASIO LOST IN THE MAYORAL ELECTION. SO, CLEARLY, HE RESPONDED THE ONLY WAY STATEN ISLAND UNDERSTANDS-- WITH A MOB-STYLE EXECUTION OF THEIR MOST BELOVED RESIDENT. IT WAS A COLD-BLOODED GROUNDHOG HIT JOB STRAIGHT OUT OF "WOODFELLAS," ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE CONSPIRACY GOES EVEN DEEPER, FOLKS BECAUSE AFTER THE MAYOR MADE SURE CHUCK HAD SEEN HIS LAST SHADOW,  STATEN ISLAND ZOO OFFICIALS WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HIDE THE DEATH FROM THE PUBLIC-- POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE ZOO GETS NEARLY HALF ITS $3.5 MILLION ANNUAL FUNDING FROM THE CITY. THAT'S RIGHT. THE MAYOR BOUGHT THE ZOO'S SILENCE. TURNS OUT ELEPHANTS DON'T HAVE SUCH A GREAT MEMORY WHEN THEY'RE BEING PAID TO "FUHGET ABOUT IT." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL, HOW DID MAYOR DEBLASIO PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS OFF? SHOULDN'T A CLAIRVOYANT ANIMAL, ABLE TO SEE SIX WEEKS INTO THE FUTURE, ALSO SEE HIS OWN DEATH COMING? WELL BAD NEWS, BILL-- HE DID.
NOT THE ONLY BOMBSHELL IN THIS REPORT. CHUCK WAS ACTUALLY CHARLOTTE. IT WAS A FEMALE STAND-IN. AND THE GROUNDHOGS HAD BEEN SWAPPED OUT BECAUSE ZOO OFFICIALS WERE CONCERNED THAT CHUCK WOULD HAVE TRIED TO BITE THE MAYOR.
Stephen:  OF COURSE CHUCK WOULD'VE TRIED TO BITE THE MAYOR! IT WAS KILL OR BE KILLED AT THAT POINT! IT WAS KILL OR BE KILLED! SO CHUCK ARRANGED FOR A BODY DOUBLE-- NO DOUBT AFTER GETTING A TIP FROM HIS MOLE IN CITY HALL. OH, AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO GET YOUR HANDS ON CHUCK NOW, MAYOR DEBLASIO. BECAUSE I HEAR HE'S GONE UNDERGROUND. NOW, NATION, WE ARE JUST FOUR DAYS INTO OUR LATEST WAR. FOR MORE, LET'S GO TO SOMETHING LOUD AND FLASHY. DA-DA-DA. DUN-DUN-DUN. AIRSTRIKES ON TERROR! SYRIA'S BUSINESS. SHOVE IT UP THEIR ISIL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JIMMY? JIMMY, I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO FIX THE SOUND ON THAT.
WE DID.
Stephen:  GREAT! SOUNDS GOOD. ALL RIGHT. FOLKS, AS EXCITED AS I AM THAT WE'RE FINALLY DROPPING BOMBS, IF I WERE IN CHARGE, I'D MAKE IT A LITTLE BOMBIER. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
THIS IS PART OF THE BOMB DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. THERE YOU SEE THE PICTURE BEFORE OF A FACILITY, AND THEN AFTER, AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
YOU ALMOST HAVE TO LOOK TWICE.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK TWICE. THEY BLEW UP HALF THE BUILDING WHERE MOST OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS.
THAT'S JUST IT. WHY DIDN'T THEY BLOW UP THE WHOLE BUILDING. ESSENTIALLY, THEY KNOCKED OUT CABLE TV FOR THAT BUILDING.
WHY DIDN'T THEY BLOW UP THE WHOLE THING. ALL THE AIRSTRIKES ARE DOING IS KNOCKING OUT ISIS'S CABLE. THOUGH THEY WILL BE SUCKED INTO A QUAGMIRE WITH A SOULLESS ENEMY. THAT'S AGAINST THE GENEVA CONVENTION. PLUS, MISSILES AREN'T ENOUGH HERE. WE NEED BOOTS ON THE GROUND, YET OBAMA REFUSES TO SEND TROOPS ON THE FLIMSY EXCUSE THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD THINKS THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. FORTUNATELY, THERE'S A NEW PLAN FROM AMERICA'S GREATEST MILITARY MIND.
WE NEED A WORLDWIDE STRIKE FORCE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE HOT SPOTS IN THE WORLD AND CONFRONT ISLAMIC TERRORISM, JIHADDISTS ON THE GROUND. WE NEED THAT. BUT WHY SHOULD THE UNITED STATES HAVE TO PROTECT THE WHOLE WORLD? SO MY IDEA IS TO RAISE A FORCE OF 25,000 MERCENARIES,  WELL PAID. IF YOU DON'T PAY, YOU DON'T GET ANY PROTECTION. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY MILITARY PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME GOING, "THAT'S A GREAT IDEA."
Stephen:  HE'S RIGHT. I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM. AND YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THESE MERCENARIES WILL BE GOOD GUYS BECAUSE ONLY THE BEST PEOPLE KILL WHOEVER YOU WANT FOR CASH. IT'S QUALITY FOLKS LIKE I'M SAYING. UNLIKE THOSE SUCKERS WHO DO IT FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY. BUT, SADLY, NOT EVERYONE IS SEEING EYE TO EYE WITH PAPA BEAR, LIKE THE LEFTIES OVER AT FOX NEWS.
WITH YOUR IDEA, YOU'VE GONE FROM  OUT OF THE BOX TO OFF THE WALL. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD, RESPONSIBLE FOR A BAND OF DESPERADOES?
IT COULD TURN INTO A FRANKENSTEIN FORCE THAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL WITH UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA, A TERRIBLE IDEA, NOT JUST AS A PRACTICAL MATTER BUT AS A MORAL MATTER. WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING AN ARMY OF MARVEL AVENGERS OR THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.
Stephen:  OH, COME ON! PLEASE. BILL'S PLAN ISN'T LIKE THE AVENGERS OR GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. THEY'D BE AN ELITE TEAM OF PROS PUTTING THEIR CONSCIENCES ASIDE TO DISH OUT VIOLENCE FOR BIG MONEY. SO IT'S LIKE THE NFL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE DRAFTING OUR TEAMS IN BILL'S FANTASY WARFARE LEAGUE, FOLKS, I'VE GOT MY OWN PLANS FOR AN ELITE STRIKE FORCE THAT I DREW UP YEARS AGO, IN MRS. TEMPLETON'S FOURTH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. AND UNLIKE BILL'S PLAN, MINE DOESN'T NEED 25,000 MERCENAIRES-- JUST 10. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL MUTANT DOUBLE NINJA SUPERSOLDIERS WITH LASER NUNCHUKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT, ISIS DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST "STEVIE'S SOOPER SOLJER SQUAD." THERE'S BRICK, SNAKE, TANK, SNAKE M., SNAKE R. A LOT OF THEM ARE NAMED SNAKE SO ONLY SNAKE DOESN'T HAVE TO USE THE LAST INITIAL BECAUSE HE SIGNED UP FIRST. THESE GUYS ARE ALL PRIMED FOR THE KILL BECAUSE THEY WERE FROZEN IN CRYOSTASIS RIGHT AFTER THEY SAW THEIR DOG KILLED. WHICH MEANS WHEN THEY THAW OUT THEY'RE LIKE "NOOOOO!" KARATE CHOP! KARATE CHOP! PEW PEW PEW! BACKFLIP! LAND ON A SKATEBOARD! PUNCH A DINOSAUR! AND THIS PART IS IMPORTANT-- THEY GET TO STAY UP AS LATE AS THEY WANT, AND THE ONLY PERSON THEY ANSWER TO IS THE CONTESSA. SHE'S FIRM BUT FAIR. AND THAT BLACK LEATHER JUMPSUIT IS JUST BARELY KEEPING IT ALL IN THERE FOR MRS. TEMPLETON-- I MEAN THE CONTESSA! SO LISTEN UP, BILL. BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE'RE PRETENDING THERE'S A WAY TO FIGHT A WAR THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SACRIFICE AND THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS DON'T HAVE TO FEEL ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR, WE SHOULD THINK BIGGER. LIKE MAYBE MY INVISIBLE BOMB THAT BLOWS UP ONLY BAD GUYS. BILL, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY MILITARY PEOPLE ARE CALLING ME AND SAYING THAT'S JUST AS GOOD AS YOUR IDEA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
