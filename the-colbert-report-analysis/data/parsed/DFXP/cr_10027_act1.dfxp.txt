Stephen:  TONIGHT, A FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN IS ARRESTED. EVEN MORE SHOCKING, SOME FLORIDA CONGRESSMEN WEREN'T. THEN, CONTROVERSY AT THE WINTER GAMES. SOMEONE FINALLY SAID IT-- LUGE AND BOBSLED ARE THE SAME THING! ( LAUGH ) AND MY GUEST TONIGHT IS M.I.A. WILL SOMEBODY FIND HER? THE SHOW A ABOUT TO START. AMSTERDAM IS PAYING ALCOHOLICS BEER TO CLEAN THE STREET. BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST GOING TO SPEND THAT BEER ON WEED. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT.    Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WOULD. NATIONS THE HOLIDAYS ARE UPON US AND SHE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M READY FOR SOME TRINK LING LIGHTS AND FROSTY THE SNOWMAN, AND WALKING IN A WINTER WONDERLAND. SPEAKING OF SNOW, COCAINE. SAD, DRUG-RELATED NEWS THIS WEEK, AND LIKE MOST SAD NEWS, IT COMES FROM WASHINGTON. JIM?
REPUBLICAN TREY RADEL OF FLORIDA TODAY PLEADED GUILTY TO COCAINE POSSESSION.
HE PURCHASED THREE AND A HALF GRAMS OF COCAINE FROM AN UNDERCOVER OFFICER.
THE TEA PARTY FAVORITE REPRESENTS FLORIDA'S 19th DISTRICT.
Stephen:  YES, THIS RISING TEA PARTY STAR WAS CAUGHT IN A COKE BUST. APPARENTLY HE FORGOT THE PART OF THE TEA PARTY STORY WHERE YOU DUMP THE PRODUCT IN THE HARBOR BEFORE THE COPS SHOW UP. FOLKS, PERSONALLY, I HATE TO LOSE A CONGRESSMAN SO FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE THAT I'M SURE HE SNORTED HIS BLOW THROUGH A $1 BILL. AND SO COMMITTED TO FAMILY VALUES, FOLKS, THAT HE ACTUALLY VOTED TO DRUG TEST PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FOOD STAMPS ( BOOING ) NO, NO, NO. HE'S NOT A HYPOCRITE. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GET FOOD STAMPS FROM THE GOVERNMENT. JUST HIS PAYCHECK. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED. I'M BEEN ON THE COCAINE CONGRESS BEAT SINCE ROBERT WEXLER TOLD ME THIS.
I ENJOY COCAINE BECAUSE IT'S THE FUN THING TO DO.   ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  WHAT IS IT WITH FLORIDA CONGRESSMEN? I MEAN, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER DOWN THERE. AND I'M GUESSING IT'S COCAINE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU KNOW, FOLKS, WE SHOULD ALL HAVE SEEN RADEL'S TRIP DOWN 8-BALL MOUNTAIN COMING. WHEN RADEL RECORDED THIS SPANISH LANGUAGE MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF COLOMBIA.
A MESSAGE FROM FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN TREY RADEL TO THE COLOMBIAN COMMUNITY. LAST WEEK I WAS IN THE BEAUTIFUL, SPECTACULAR, AND GROWING COUNTRY OF COLOMBIA. IN PART, STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ALLY AND FRIEND COUNTRY. BUT MOSTLY, TO SCORE COKE. ( LAUGHTER ) SPECIFICALLY, I WANT A RELIABLE SOURCE OF THE PUREST COLOMBIAN COKE. FRANKLY, I'M TIRED OF MIDDLE MEN DILUTING MY ( BLEEP ) WITH BABY LAXATIVES. SO I NEED TO CONNECT TO BEAM ME UP ON SOME OF THAT STRAIGHT, COLOMBIAN GUTTER GLITTER. WE CONSIDER SHARE IT AND THEN WE WILL DANCE AND DANCE AND DANCE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  SO BEST OF LUCK, CONGRESSMAN. WE WILL MISS YOU, AND OF COURSE-- WHAT'S THAT? HE'S NOT RESIGNING? WHAT IS HE, HIGH! FOLKS,UB I'M NOT ONE TO SIT IN JUDGMENT. I PREFER TO JUMP UP AND DOWN IN JUDGMENT. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FIRST UP, FOLKS, JUST SECONDS AGO I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR, I'M NO FAN OF DRUG ADDICTS. JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM MAKES ME SO ANGRY I NEED ANOTHER XANAX. THAT'S WHY I WAS HIGH ON LIFE WHEN I LEARNED WITH A NEW STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT FOUND A FATHER'S COCAINE USE MAKES HIS SONS LESSENSITIVE TO THE DRUG, AND THEREBY MORE LIKELY TO RESIST ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS. WHICH MEANS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CRIPPLING COCAINE ADDICTION, BE SURE TO THANK YOUR DAD. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND HIM. HE'S PROBABLY GIVING OUT HANDIES AT THE BUS STATION. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF MY HAT TO HOPPED-UP POPS. CONGRATULATIONS.   ( APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVE FINALLY--   ( CHEERS ) YOU HAVE FINALLY-- YOU HAVE FINALLY EARNED THAT FATHER OF THE YEAR MUG YOU STOLE FROM THE HALLMARK STORE AFTER BITING THE CASHIER. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT COCAINE CAUSES D.N.A. ALTERATIONS IN SPERM IN WHICH THE CHANGES ARE TRANSMITTED TO MALES IN THE NEXT GENERATION, MEANING COCAINE ADDICTION SKIPS A GENERATION, LIKE BALDNESS. BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO AVOID BALDNESS, REMEMBER, YOU CAN SELL YOUR HAIR FOR COKE. SO THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE A DUDE DO A BUMP OFF A TOILET SEAT AT A STRIP CLUB, JUST SAY TO YOURSELF, "THAT GUY'S GOING TO MAKE A GREAT DAD." NEXT UP, FOLKS, I AM NO FAN OF AMERICA'S GLOBAL ARCHNEMESIS AND PRIMARY INVESTOR CHINA. THEY ARE SO SMUG WITH THEIR SURGING ECONOMY, THEIR WALL VISIBLE FROM SPACE, AND THEIR SEEMINGLYLESS ENDs SUPPLY OF LUCKY NUMBERS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT FINALLY, FINALLY, AMERICAN CULTURE IS STRIKING BACK.
STARBUCKS IS FACING SCRUTINY IN CHINA THIS WEEK BECAUSE STATE MEDIA IS ACCUSING IT OF OVERPRICING. $4.50 FOR A MEDIUM-SIZED LATTE, ROUGHLY A THIRD MORE THAN IN THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT. OUR COLD WAR HAS ESCALATED INTO A CRISE SO HOT, YOU NEED ONE OF THOSE CARD BOARD THINGS TO HOLD IT. SO I'M GIVING A TIP OF THE HAT TO STARBUCKS FOR FINDING A WAY TO STICK IT TO THE CHINESE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WE'VE CALLED OUT THE CHINESE ON ONE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION AFTER ANOTHER WITH NO RESPONSE. BUT TO CRANK UP THE PRIVACY A NO-FOAM MATCHIATO, AND THE GOVERNMENT RELEASES A 20-MINUTE BROADCAST CALLED-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- "STARBUCKS, EXPENSIVE IN CHINA." I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FOLLOW-UP FILM-- ""DUNKIN' DONUTS: WHEN THE HELL ARE THEY SELLING TUNA SANDWICHES. WHAT'S BEHIND THE BULL MARKET IN THE CHINA COFFEE SHOP? ACCORDING TO STOOSHZ ITS HIGHER COST COMES FROM SUCH FACTORS AS LABOR AND INGREDIENTS. OF COURSE INGREDIENTS WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE IN CHINA FRAPPACHINOS CONTAIN FRESH LUMP CRAB MEAT AND CADMIUM. SPEAKING OF CHINA-- I JUST WAS-- AND THIS WEEK, THERE WAS MORE BAD NEWS.
CHINESE SHOPPERS SET ONLINE SALES RECORDS MONDAY. SHOPPERS CLICKED THEIR WAY TO MORE THAN $5 BILLION IN PRODUCTS ON CHINA'S LARGEST E-COMMERCE SITE. THAT DWARFS SALES ON CYBER MONDAY IN THE UNITED STATES.
$5 BILLION WORTH OF SALES.
THAT IS 2. THE 5 TIMES MORE THAN CYBER MONDAY IN THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen:  FOLKS, IF CHINA HAS THE CASH TO DO THIS, WE'RE CLEARLY NOT BORROWING ENOUGH UPON IT ( LAUGHTER ) I'M GIVING THE NEXT WAG OF MY FING TORE AMERICAN CONSUMERS. HOW YOU CAN NOT OUTSPEND THESE GUYS? ONLINE SHOPPING IS MUCH HARDER FOR THE CHINESE. AFTER THEY BUY AN iPAD, THEY HAVE TO RUN BACK TO THE FACTORY TO MAKE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE OCCASION FOR ALL THIS PEKING KA-CHING WAS NOVEMBER 11, CHINA'S SINGLES' DAY, SYMBOLIZE BIDE THE FOUR LONELY ONES OF 11-11. OF COURSE THE IDEA OF ONE AS THE LOAMEST NUMBER WAS FIRST FOUND IN THE WRITINGS OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHER, HA-RI NIL-SUN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THE CHINESE, THE CHINESE ORIGINALLY STARTED SINGLES DAY AS A TIME FOR UNMARRIED MEP TO LAMENT THEIR SOLO STATUS WITH A DRINK. WE HAVE A SIMILAR PRACTICE OF MEN DRINKING ALONE IN AMERICA. IT'S CALLED LADIES' NIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO TAKE A LESSON FROM CHINA AND HARNESS THE ECONOMIC POWER OF LONELY, SINGLE MEN. YOU GUYS NEED TO STEP UP AND START BUYING MORE STUFF. I MEAN, LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE WATCHING MY SHOW. ON THE COUCH, PROBABLY ALONE. ME, I GO HOME EVERY NIGHT AND SPEND TIME WITH MY LOVED ONES. DADDY LOVES YOU, PLAYSTATION 4. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WHO YOU DOVE ME BACK? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
