Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS FIELDING REPORTERS' QUESTIONS. TO MAKE HIM FEEL AT HOME, I WON'T BELIEVE A WORD HE'S SAYING. PLEASE WELCOME JAY CARNEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, JAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. ALL RIGHT. UH, UH, JAY.
STEPHEN.
Stephen:  STEPHEN COLBERT, THE "COLBERT REPORT." I HAVE A 12-PART QUESTION. JAY, ARE YOU GOING TO ANSWER ANY OF MY QUESTIONS TODAY?
I'LL SAY A LOT.
Stephen:  YOU'LL SAY A LOT? ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU STILL WORKING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALLY RIGHT NOW?
I HAVE ANOTHER 24 HOURS AS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, SO --
Stephen:  OKAY, GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO I CAN STILL MAINTAIN A HEALTHY CONTEMPT FOR YOU. BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU'RE NOT WORKING FOR THAT GUY, YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO LIKE YOU.
WELL I HOPE SO.
Stephen:  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? FIRST OF ALL, WHY ARE YOU QUITTING, YOU QUITTER? COULD YOU NOT TAKE IT?
I GOT AN E-MAIL FROM SOMEBODY CALLING ME A QUITTER.
Stephen:  YOU ARE A QUITTER, QUITTER. MAN UP. THERE'S A WAR ABOUT TO START IN IRAQ AGAIN. COME ON. DON'T YOU WANT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS?
YOU KNOW, I GOT AN E-MAIL EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO SAID, "YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE LONGEST SERVING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SINCE THE MID-90s." AND I CHECKED, AND IT'S TRUE. I DIDN'T QUITE REALIZE THAT IT WAS SUCH A HIGH-BURNOUT JOB. BECAUSE I-- I'M A GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT, AND I ACTUALLY LIKE IT.
Stephen:  REALLY?
I LOVE IT, AND I LIKE-- THERE'S NOTHING BETTER, I FIND, THAN REALLY CONTENTIOUS BRIEFING TO MAKE MY DAY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  WELL, YOU'VE HAD A FEW.
I'VE HAD A FEW.
Stephen:  DO THEY TELL YOU ARE YOU HAVING A MEETING BEFORE YOU GO OUT THERE SAYING, REMEMBER, THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SUBJECT, LET'S ALL--" IT MIGHT BE, "THIS IS HOW THE PRESIDENT FEELS OR THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY." OR DO YOU SOME DAYS GO OUT THERE AND SAY, "I'M GOING TO WING THIS AND TRY NOT TO START AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT?"
THERE IS A DANGER THAT AS YOU'VE DONE IT FOR A WHILE, YOU BEGIN TO THINK YOU DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLY --
Stephen:  I'M KIND OF THE PRESIDENT. I'M KIND OF THE PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU FEEL LIKE, HEY, THE CAMERA'S POINTED AT ME. I MUST BE THE MAN.
MAKE SOME POLICY TODAY. NO, WHAT YOU REALIZE IS THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE UNITED STATES, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. AND YOU-- YOU COULD INADVERTENTLY CAUSE A CRISIS OR A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR NATION AND ANOTHER NATION. SO WE DID SPEND A-- WE DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME BEFORE BRIEFINGS, GOING OVER WHAT IS THE NEW DEVELOPMENT OR WHAT NEW ARE WE SAYING ABOUT A CRISIS OVERSEAS OR AT HOME.
Stephen:  WHAT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU EVER MADE? WHERE DID YOU REALLY SHANK IT? BIGGEST REGRET LIKE, "I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT."
MY BIGGEST REGRET IS OCCASIONALLY I TOOK THE BAIT. AND WHEN YOU'RE AT THE PODIUM, YOU'RE A LITTLE ABOVE EVERYBODY ELSE --
Stephen:  I'VE STOOD UP THERE. IT'S A HEADY FEELING.
AND YOU CAN, YOU KNOW, DICTATE A LITTLE BIT HOW THE BRIEFING GOES BY CALLING ON THE NEXT PERSON. SO IT'S EASY TO WIN AN EXCHANGE. WHEN SOMEBODY'S GETTING RILED UP AND FILLED WITH SOMETIMES FEIGNED RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION
Stephen:  COME ON, JAY!
EXACTLY.
Stephen:  YOU DIDN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION!
AND IF THEY'RE REALLY OBNOXIOUS AND YOU GET A LITTLE RATTLED AND YOU SORT OF ENGAGE, YOU FINISH THE EXCHANGE THINKING I WON THAT. I KILLED. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT IT LATER ON TV, AND YOU REALIZE THAT NOBODY ACTUALLY SEES THE WHOLE EXCHANGE. THEY JUST SEE YOU WAGGING YOUR FINGER OR, YOU KNOW, LOOKING LIKE A JERK. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE PRESIDENT. SO THOSE ARE THE-- I DIDN'T DO THAT OFTEN. BUT WHEN I DID --
Stephen:  IT WAS TO JONATHAN CARL OF ABC NEWS. ( LAUGHTER ).
IT COULD HAVE BEEN. WE HAD OUR MOMENTS.
Stephen:  YOU TWO HAD YOUR TENSE MOMENTS. NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST GET A ROOM. BECAUSE-- ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU KNOW, HE AND OTHERS IN THAT ROOM ARE DOING THEIR JOBS.
Stephen:  A JOB YOU DID.
I USED TO DO IT. I DID IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE I WAS WORKING --
Stephen:  BECAUSE YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEY ARE, RIGHT? A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT BUT I WAS A "TIME" MAGAZINE REPORTER BACK WHEN IT WAS A WEEKLY MAGAZINE. WHEN I COVERED CLINTON AND GEORGE W. BUSH, BEFORE THERE WAS THAT NEED, EVEN AT THE MAGAZINES, TO SORT OF, YOU KNOW, FILL THE NEWS HOLE EVERY MINUTE, EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY.
Stephen:  I BELIEVE REQUEST THE TIME" MAGAZINE HAS CHANGED ITS NAME TO "THE NEWS HOLE." ( LAUGHTER ).
SO WHAT THAT MEANT WAS I DIDN'T ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF BACK-AND-FORTH VERY OFTEN WITH THE PRESS SECRETARY. BUT THOSE FOLKS ARE DOING THEIR JOB. SOMETIMES I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT THE BRIEFING IS TELEVISED IN ITS ENTIRETY, SOMETHING THAT MIKE McCURRY BACK IN THE 90s UNDER CLINTON HAS SAID YES TO AND APOLOGIZED TO EVERY SUCCESSIVE PRESS SECRETARY, CREATES A THEATERICALITY TO IT AND SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW, RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION. PEOPLE POSE AND THEY WANT TO HEAR THEMSELVES TALK OR THEY WANT TO CREATE MOMENTS, CREATING SOME DRAMA.
Stephen:  SHUT THE ( BLEEP ) UP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) DID YOU EVER-- DID YOU EVER-- DID YOU EVER--
OH, DID I WANT --
Stephen:  HEY, HEY, GUYS I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHY DON'T YOU BITE ME.
YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY I HAD MY LAST BRIEFING FROM THE PODIUM AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP, DID YOU WANT TO BE A PRESS SECRETARY? DID YOU HAVE A POSTER OF TRUMAN'S PRESS SECRETARY? THE VEST. THE FLAK JACKET.
IT'S NOT A VERY IMPRESSIVE FLAK JACKET.
Stephen:  ARE YOU ALLOWED TO TELL WHAT NOTE YOU LEFT OR IS THAT A SECRET? YOU LEAVE A NOTE, RIGHT?
I'M GOING TO WRITE ONE TOMORROW FOR JOSH EARNEST WHO HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC DEPUTY AND WILL BE THE NEXT PRESS SECRETARY
Stephen:  I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS TO YOU, BUT WHAT A NAME FOR PRESS SECRETARY. JOSH EARNEST. HIS NAME LITERALLY MEANS JUST KIDDING BUT SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAY. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY FOR 24 MORE HOURS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
