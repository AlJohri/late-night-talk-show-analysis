Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. NATION, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET I LOVE  TELEVISION AND UNLESS YOU'RE  WATCHING THIS ONLINE TOMORROW, YOU DO TOO. AND IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS  ONLINE TOMORROW, REMIND ME TO  PICK UP MY DRY CLEANING BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE I THINK I WILL  HAVE FORGOTTEN. OF COURSE, ESPECIALLY I LOVE  BASE I BELIEVE CABLE AND MY  NETWORK COMEDY CENTRAL, WHICH IS PART OF MTV NETWORKS WHOSE  PARENT COMPANY IS VIACOM WHICH  IS WHOLLY OWNED BY DR. SINISTER. GOOD LUCK BLOWING UP THE SUN,  SIR, WE'RE ALL PULLING FOR YOU. KEEP THOSE CHECKS COMING. BUT SADLY SOMEONE IS TRYING TO  HORN IN ON BASIC CABLE'S TURF  BECAUSE THE FOUR MAJOR BROADCAST METH WORKS HAVE PETITIONED THE  F.C.C. TO LOOSEN INDECENCY  RULINGS WHICH LIMIT FOUL LANGUAGE AND AND DESHUNS OF  NUDITY AND SEX. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS COULD  MEAN? THEY MAY START TALKING ABOUT SEX  AND BOOBS ON TWO BROKE GIRLS. INSTEAD OF HOUSEHOLD BUDGETING  WHICH IS WHAT I ASSUME THE SHOW  IS ABOUT. WHAT'S BEHINDS THE CHANGE? WELL, THANKS TO THE RISE OF  CABLE TV, THE INTERNET AND VIDEO  GAMES, ABC CBS FOX AND NBC SAY THAT THE RULES ARE ARCHAIC  BECAUSE THE NETWORKS HAVE LOST  SO MUCH CULTURAL CLOUT. HOW RIGHT THEY ARE. THEY SIMPLY CANNOT COMPETE WITH  THAT BASTION OF CLOUT AND  CULTURE KNOWN AS BASIC CABLE HOME OF SUCH SOME PHYSICIAN  TICKETED CULTURAL FARE SUCH AS  THE SYMPOSIUM ON THE ANCIENT DYNASTY OF DUCK. AND THE CHANNEL OF LEARNING'S  INFORMATIVE SERIES -- AND THIS  IS FOR REAL -- THE MAN WITH THE 132-POUND SCROTUM. EVERY HE EPISODE IS A CLIFF  HANGER. NOW, FOLKS, I FEAR... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I FEAR THAT NETWORK AUDIENCES  ARE SIMPLY UNPREPARED FOR THE  RICH CULTURAL FEAST WE SERVE UP IN CABLE. FOR INSTANCE, HERE IT IS. I HOLD IN MY HAND AN ACTUAL --  AND I CAN'T IMPRESS UPON YOU  ENOUGH -- ACTUAL GLOSSARY OF TERMS APPROVED FOR USE BY MY  EMPLOYERS AT VIACOM. IT IS WORDS SUCH AS THESE THAT  THE BROADCAST NETWORKS ARE  SPENDING VAST AMOUNTS OF TIME AND MONEY TO HAVE THE LEGAL  RIGHT TO SAY ON OUR NATION'S AIR  WAVES. JOINING ME NOW TO GIVE LIFE TO  THIS CULTURAL DOCUMENT IS  AWARD-WINNING BRITISH PERSON AND RECOVERING NETWORK STAR SIR HUGH  LAURIE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SIR HUGH.

Stephen: YOU'RE THE GUEST. ALL RIGHT. THUMB IN BUTT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
