Stephen: WHOOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: FEEL THE  ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM  RIGHT NOW, OH, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. THEY ARE A LIVE WIRE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THIS ROOM IS SO  ELECTRICKICALLY CHARGED  RIGHT NOW, I WISH I WAS WEARING RUBBER PANTS. NOW FOLKS THANK YOU FOR  COMING TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE AND  I'M SORRY TO BRING YOU BAD  NEWS. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  AMERICA HAS LOST ANOTHER  BATTLE IN THE CULTURE WAR. WHICH IS SURPRISING BECAUSE  WE'VE GOT ALL THE GUNS. (LAUGHTER)  THIS TIME THE BATTLEFIELD IS  COMIC BOOKS. AND FOLKS,S THAT SADDENS ME  BECAUSE I'M A FAN. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING I LOVE. COLOURFUL PICTURES, AND A  LACK OF GRAMMAR. HULK MASH, STEPHEN LIKE. AND TONIGHT, FOLKS, I GOT A  REAL BEE IN MY CAPE OVER A  DANGEROUS THEY EDITION TO THE MARVEL UNIVERSE.
MARVEL COMICS IS  REBOOTING A POPULAR  SUPERHERO AND SHE IS AMONG  THE FIRST TO BE BOTH FEMALE AND MUSLIM. THEY'RE BRINGING BACK MISS  MARVEL, A 16-YEAR-OLD  DAUGHTER OF PAKISTANI  IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN NEW  JERSEY.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  THAT REPORT ON MISS MARVEL,  MISS RODRA-GWEEZ. FOLKS, THIS--   (LAUGHTER)  THIS AFFRONT HAS TAKEN ME  ABACK. A MUSLIM CANNOT BE A  SUPERHERO, FOR PETE'S SAKES,  THEY'RE ON THE NO FLY LIST. (LAUGHTER)  HER NAME IS KAMALA KHAN AND  AS MISS MARVEL, SHE CAN GROW  AND SHRINK HER LIMBS AND HER BODY, AND SHAPE SHIFT INTO  OTHER FORMS. FOLKS, IF SHE CAN SHAPE  SHIFT, THAT MEANS LITERALLY  ANYTHING COULD BE MUSLIM. A LAMP, A SANDWICH, A TIGER,  A NONTHREATENING MUSLIM. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S EVEN MORE UPSETTING  WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE  ORIGINAL MISS MARVEL. SHE WAS WHOLESOME AND  ALL-AMERICAN. BLOND, FAMILY VALUED WITH  TWO BULGING CHEST MUSCLES. AND CLEARLY WEARING HER  SUNDAY CHURCH PANTIES. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN  SHARIA CREEP PLAIN AND  SIMPLE. FIRST SHE'S A COMIC  CHARACTER. THEN SHE GETS HER OWN MOVIE,  THEN ACTION FIGURES, THE  NEXT THING YOU KNOW, MY KIDS ARE DRESSING UP AS HER FOR  HALLOWEEN AND SHOUTING TRICK  OR TREAT, DEATH TO CAPTAIN  AMERICA! IT'S COMING. MARK MY WORDS. NATION, YOU KNOW I AM JUDGE,  JURY AND EXECUTIONER SO  MAKING LOVE WITH ME IS A  FOUR-WAY. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG  OF THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLK, I DON'T HAVE TO TILL  THE KIDS HAVE LOST OUT OF  WHAT IS IMPORTANT, ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS THEIR TWEETING  AND THEIR TWERKING, RUBBING  YOUR BUTT AGAINST THINGS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR  REVENGE AGAINST YOUR BOSS. THAT'S WHY PERSONALLY I'M  GRATEFUL OUR KIDS HAVE ONE  RELIABLE SOURCE OF GOOD  VALUES, TELEVISION ADS.
TODAY WE'RE TAKING SOME  KIDS ON THE BEST FIELD TRIP  THEY COULD WISH FOR, AND THEY DONE EVEN KNOW IT.
HI, GUYS. I'M RANGER BRAD. WELCOME ABOARD. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WASTE ANY  TIME. LET'S PLAY NAME THAT LEAF. WHAT'S THIS ONE? HE SAYS IT IS AN OAK LEAF. IT IS A FIELD MAPLE, THAT'S  OKAY. I'M A BIG FAN OF TREES, I  DONE KNOW IF YOU CAN TEMPT  BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE FOREST TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO  TOIS TOIS, GUYS. -- TOYS R US. WELCOME TO THE WORLD'S  GREATEST TOY STORE! TOYS R US HAS REALLY  CAPTURED THE MAGIC OF HAVING  A STRANGER TAKE YOUR KIDS ON  A BUS, LIE ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING THEN TAKE OFF  HIS CLOTHES AND PROMISE HIM  TOYS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, MORE  PORNLY, I WANT TO GIVE A BIG  TIP OF THE HAT TO TOYS R US FOR REMINDING OUR KIDS THAT  NATURE SUCKS. THIS COMMERCIAL SHOWS KIDS  THE GREAT OUTDOORS IS  NOTHING COMPARED TO THE  MAJESTY OF A STRIP MALL. AND THEY STILL GET SOME  NATURE BECAUSE REMEMBER,  THAT CONFETTI USED TO BE A  TREE. BESIDES NATURE IS BORING. I PLAYED IN IT ONCE. IT WAS NOTHING TO BUY, I HAD  TO PRETEND TO STICK WITH A  SWORD OR TELESCOPE OR MAGIC  WAND. THAT'S TOO MANY OPTION. KIDS NEED THE CLARITY OF A  MOLDED PLASTIC NERF RIFLE. IT'S NOT JUST THE FOREST  THAT BLOWS, IT'S THE ANIMALS  TOO. KIDS CAN LEARN A LOT MORE  FROM THE ANIMALS OF CHUCK E. CHEESE THAN THEY CAN FROM A  POLAR BEAR AT THE ZOO. I WATCHED THIS GUY FOR AN  HOUR, HE -- PLAY ANY  BLUEGRASS EVEN AFTER I THREW  A BANJO AT HIM. NEXT UP, FOLKS, WE ONLY HAVE  SO LONG ON THIS PLANET. SO WHEN I DIE I WANT TO BE  BURIED IN THE MOST MASSIVE  MAUSOLEUM POSSIBLE. THAT WAY I CAN SPEND  ETERNITY DOING WHAT I LOVE  MOST, TAKE UP MORE SPACE  THAN I NEED. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S WHY I AM SO OFFENDED  BY THIS NEW PRODUCT.
A MUSHROOM BURIAL SUIT  DESIGNED TO HELP THE BODY  DECOMPOSE AFTER DEATH IS THE LATEST CONCEPT TURNING HEADS  AT A CONVENTION DOWNTOWN.
IT'S A MUSHROOM DEATH  SUIT EMBEDDED WITH AN  INFINITE MUSHROOM SPORS  DESIGNED TO SPEED OFF-- FEED OFF THE BODY AND SPEED UP  DECOMPOSITION.
SPEED UP DECOMPOSITION,  I'M SORRY, IS MY DEAD BODY  NOT DECOMPOSING FAST ENOUGH FOR YOU. HOW THOUGHTLESS OF ME. FOLKS, I WOULD NOT BE CAUGHT  DEAD IN THIS MUSHROOM DEATH  SUIT. WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, WAS  ALSO THE NAME OF MY DOOM  METAL BAND. SO I AM GIVING A BIG WAG OF  THE FINGER TO SHROOM TOMB. FOLK, THE BURIAL INDUSTRIAL  COMPLEX IS RALLYING BEHIND  THIS MUSHROOM SHROUD FOR THE WORST POSSIBLE REASONS.
THE IDEA TO WERE TECT THE  ENVIRONMENT FROM TOXIC  CHEMICALS, THE SUIT MAKER SAYS R OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH  KRE MATION AND GRAVEYARD  BURIALS.
INSTEAD OF KRE MATION  WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE GREEN  OPTIONS, NATURAL BURIAL OPTIONS AND THIS LENDS  ITSELF TO THAT.
WHO ARE THESE MONSTERS  WHO TURN MY DEATH INTO SOME  KIND OF NATURAL PROCESS? AND PERSONALLY I HAVE NO  INTEREST IN THE LOW GRADE  SHIITAKES THIS THING WILL  TURN ME INTO. TO, IF I'M TURNING INTO A  FUNGUS IT HAD BETTER BECOME  WHITE PREMIUM TRUFFLES  SNIFFED OUT BY A BOAR IN THE FOREST OF ITALY THEN SHAVED  OVER A HEDGE FUND MANAGER'S  LYNN QUEENEE FOR $300 A  PLATE. WOW, WOW. -- LINGUINI. (APPLAUSE)  I SOUND DELICIOUS. I HOPE I DIE IN TIME FOR ME  TO EAT MYSELF. FINALLY, FOLKS, I LOVE HAPPY  ENDINGS. I ALSO ENJOY STORIES THAT  FEEL GOOD AT THE CONCLUSION. WELL HERE'S ONE THAT IS SURE  TO WARM THE KOCH ELS OF YOUR  HEART. YOU ALL REMEMBER TWO YEARS  AGO WHEN THE STUDENTS AT UC  DAVIS HOLDING A SIT-IN  TERRORIZED THE CAMPUS SIDEWALK WITH THEIR BUTTS  AND HAD TO HAVE THEIR EYES  PEPPER BOARDED. IT WAS A DARK STORY THAT  GRIPPED A NATION. BUT WILL YOU BE HAPPY TO  KNOW THE VICTIM HAS FINALLY  BEEN COMPENSATED.
JOHN PIKE, THE CAMPUS  POLICE OFFICER AT UC DAVIS  WHO PEPPER SPRAYED THOSE PROTESTORS WILL RECEIVE  $38,000 IN WORKERS COMP FOR  THE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY  HE SUFFERED IN THE AFTERMATH.
Stephen: FOLKS-- I KNOW,  I'M HAPPY TOO. IT IS THE BIGGEST PAYOUT FOR  ASSAULTING PEOPLE'S EYES  SINCE TRANSFORMERS 3. (LAUGHTER)  SO I WANT TO GIVE A TIP OF  THE HAT TO JOHN PIKE FOR  FINALLY GETTING COMPENSATION FOR THE BRUTALITY OF JOHN  PIKE. THIS MAN CANNOT WALK DOWN  THE STREET WITHOUT BEING  CALLED A PEPPER SPRAY GUY. AND THAT STINGS. NOT AS BAD AS PEPPER SPRAY  BUT STILL PRETTY BAD. BECAUSE THE CORNEA CODDLERS  OUT THERE TURNED THIS GUY  INTO THE WORST THING YOU  COULD POSSIBLY BECOME, AN INTERNET MEME. AN INTERNET MEME! SO FOLKS, PIKE HAS GOTTEN  JUSTICE. BUT WHAT OF THE OCCUPIED  PROTESTORS WHOSE EYES WERE  SO DANGEROUSLY SQUIRTABLE.
JOHN PIKE WILL RECEIVE  $38,000 IN WORKERS COMP, BY  COMPARISON THE 21 PEOPLE HIT BY THE PEPPER SPRAY AND THE  OTHERWISE PEACEFUL PROTEST,  EACH RECEIVED $30,000.
Stephen: SURE, THE  PROTESTORS GOT LESS BUT ON  THE BRIGHT SIDE THEY BEAT THE ODDS AND ACTUALLY MADE  MONEY WITH A LIBERAL ARTS  DEGREE. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
