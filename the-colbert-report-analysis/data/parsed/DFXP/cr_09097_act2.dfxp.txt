( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. PLEASE. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE WATCHED  THIS SHOW. YOU KNOW I NEVER RUSH TO  JUDGMENT. I LIVE IN JUDGMENT TO CUT DOWN  ON MY COMMUTE. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, AS TELEVISION'S FOREMOST  CATHOLIC, I'M ALWAYS LOOKING OUT  FOR THE HOTTEST TRENDS HITTING THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A TIP OF  THE HAT TO THE CATHOLIC DIOCESE  OF BROOKLYN FOR REACHING OUT TO A HIP NEW AUDIENCE.
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THESE ON  PHONE BOOTHS AND PAPERING GYM  WALLS IN QUEENS AND BROOKLYN. THEY ARE ADVERTISEMENTS OF A  SNEAKER-WEARING JESUS. THE ADS CALL HIM THE ORIGINAL  HIPSTER BUT IT IS NOT A SLAM  MUCH IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO GET PEOPLE TO CHURCH.
Stephen: YES, JESUS WAS THE  ORIGINAL HIPSTER. AFTER ALL HE WAS INTO  CHRISTIANITY WAY BEFORE IT WENT  MAINSTREAM. I DON'T KNOW HOW I DIDN'T SEE  THIS SOONER, FOLKS. AN UNEMPLOYED 33-YEAR-OLD WHO  HOME-BREWS HIS OWN WATER INTO  WINE, AND THINKS HE'S GOD'S GIFT TO HUMANITY. THAT'S LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY IN  BROOKLYN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND JESUS WAS IRONIC AS IT GETS. WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WENT  SWIMMING, JESUS WAS LIKE, NAH,  I'D RATHER GO FOR A WALK. EVEN HIS DEATH WAS IRONIC. SUP, ROMANS, YEAH, I WAS DEAD  FOR A WHILE. BUT THEN I GOT BORED, YOLO. NEXT I'M NO FAN OF DRUGS, FOLKS. THEY'RE IMMORAL. HEY, DRUG MULES, SWALLOW THAT  HERO WIN WITHOUT A CONDOM. FAMILY VALUES AND SADLY, FOLKS,  THERE'S A NEW DRUG THREAT ON THE  HORIZON AND IT'S COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE OR POSSIBLY THE  KENNEL.
A VET IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  IS ADVOCATING THE USE OF MEDICAL  MARIJUANA FOR PETS. THAT SUFFER FROM CHRONIC  CONDITIONS. DR. DOUG KRAMER, A VET GURU,  SAYS HE BELIEVES ANIMALS CAN  BENEFIT FROM THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT H.T.C. IN MARIJUANA  JUST THE SAME WAY THAT HUMANS  DO. HE SAYS HIS OWN DOG BENEFITED  FROM THE USE OF MEDICAL  MARIJUANA.
Stephen: THERE WAS A VET WHO  HAD A DOG AND BONG-O WAS HIS  NAME-O. SO, A WAG OF MY FINGER AT STONER  DOGS. JOKES,... FOLKS, WE CAN'T LET  OUR DOGS RIDE THE MARY JANE  TRAIN. OR ELSE IN NO TIME THEY'LL BE  SLEEPING ALL DAY, EATING  WHATEVER THEY FIND, HUMPING ANYTHING THAT MOVES... OH, MY  GOD, IT'S TOO LATE. THAT EXPLAINS WHY DOGS ALWAYS  FREAK OUT WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO  THE DOOR. THEY'RE PARANOID IT'S THE COPS. (DOG BARKING) WAIT. WHAT'S THAT? (DOG BARKING) LASSIE, WHAT  HAPPENED, GIRL? (DOG BARKING) TIMMY'S FALLEN  DOWN A WE WILL? BUT YOU CAN'T SAVE HIM BECAUSE  YOU'RE BAKED OUT OF YOUR GOURD  AND YOUR FRIEND SKINNY LOU IS COMING OVER TO WATCH ADULT SWIM? BAD GIRL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
