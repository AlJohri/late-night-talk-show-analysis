Stephen: TONIGHT RICK PERRY FACES CRITICISM FROM A FELLOW TEXAN. TURNS OUT THERE ARE SOME OF THEM HE HASN'T EXECUTED. THEN BIG NEWS FROM THE WORLD OF COMIC BOOKS. YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO SAVE TONIGHT'S SHOW IN A PLASTIC SLEEVE. AND MY GUEST IS THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK BILL DE BLASIO. I'LL ASK IF THIS INTERVIEW CAN COUNT AS JURY DUTY. (LAUGHTER) A FIRST EDITION OF DAS KAPITAL HAS SOLD FOR $40,000. SO SUCK IT, MARX, THE RICH WIN AGAIN. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN!") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT. FOLKS, THANKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW, AND I TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, MY MOST SOLEMN DUTY IS HOLDING OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. AND TONIGHT I HAVE REELED IN THE BIGGEST FISH IN THE BIG APPLE, OUR MAYOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NO, NOT MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, BILL DE BLASIO. I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME TO HOLD DE BLASIO'S FEET TO DE FIRE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS MAN IS. MAYOR DE BLASIO IS A SOCIALIST, ALL RIGHT. HE'S JUST FLAT OUT A SOCIALIST.
AMERICA'S LEADING LEFTIST, MR. TAX THE RICH, THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK BILL DE BLASIO.
BILL DE BLASIO, HE'S THIS EUROPEAN SOCIALIST
I THINK BILL DE BLASIO IS A SOCIALIST, I CALL HIM COMRADE MAYOR.
COMRADE MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO IS GOING TO SOCK IT TO THE RICH, SOCK IT TO WALL STREET. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WALL STREET LEAVES NEW YORK.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. THANKS TO COMRADE DE BLASIO, WALL STREET IS GOING TO LEAVE NEW YORK AND MOVE TO THE PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE LIKE THEM. I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ONE. HIS HONOR LAUNCHED HIS PERSECUTION CAMPAIGN OF THE RICH AS SOON AS HE TOOK OFFICE, WHEN A BLIZZARD HIT NEW YORK CITY AND RESIDENTS OF THE WEALTHY UPPER EAST SIDE COMPLAINED THAT THEIR STREETS DIDN'T GET TOP PLOWING PRIORITY. AND HE IS STILL TARGETING THEM, FOLKS. I HAVE NOT SEEN SNOWPLOWS ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE IN MONTHS. POINT IS BOTTOM LINE, I DON'T LIKE THIS GUY. SO HOW DID I GET HIM ON MY SHOW, WELL, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNET, I BULLIED HIM INTO ACCEPTING AN INVITATION TO MY SHOW ON TWITTER. THAT'S RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BOOM. I BOOKED THE MAYOR ON TWITTER. IT'S MY BIGGEST COUP SINCE LANDING JOE BIDEN ON TINDER. (APPLAUSE) SWIPE RIGHT. ANYWAY, THE MAYOR WILL BE ON LATER AND JOE BIDEN, EVEN LATER. OF COURSE, FOLKS, I HAVE NOT STOPPED COVERING NATIONAL POLITICS AS WELL.  I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE 2016 ELECTION. BECAUSE ITS DEMOCRATS ONLY HAVE ONE ITEM ON THE MENU, HILLARY CLINTON, WHOSE SOLE QUALIFICATION IS THE FACT THAT SHE IS PROBABLY GOING WIN. MEANWHILE REPUBLICANS HAVE A BUFFET OF ENTICING OPTIONS. YOU HAVE CURLEY FRIES, YOU HAVE BEEF PATTY, YOU HAVE MILD SALSA. YOU HAVE MILDER SALSA AND OF COURSE LEFTOVERS. BUT MY PERSONAL FAVORITE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS TEXAS GOVERNOR AND CARTOON OF A TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY. THIS GUY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOCK IN 2012. COLBERT SUPER PAC SUPPORTED HIM IN THE IOWA STRAW POLL WITH A SERIES OF POWERFUL ADS URGING IOWANS TO VOTE FOR RICK PERRY WITH AN A, AN A FOR IOWA. BUT RICK PERRY BLEW IT. FIRST WHEN IT WAS REVEALED THAT HIS FAMILY'S HUNTING CAMP HAD A NAME WHICH MY CAREER WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO SAY ON TV. SO HERMANN CAIN.
-- HATER.
Stephen: AND THAT DAMNING REVELATION LED HIS OPPONENTS TO SAY --
AH, SCHUK A DUCKY. CLASSIC. OF COURSE, FOLKS, WHAT REALLY SANK RICK PERRY WAS A DEBATE GAFFE THAT NO ONE CAN FORGET EXCEPT HIM.
IT'S THREE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT WHEN I GET THERE THAT ARE GONE. COMMERCE, EDUCATION AND THE-- THE WAS'S THE THIRD ONE THERE --
YOU CAN'T NAME THE THIRD ONE.
THE THIRD AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT, I WOULD DO AWAY WITH, EDUCATION-- THE--  COMMERCE --
AND LET'S SEE-- I CAN'T, THE THIRD ONE, I CAN'T, SORRY. OOPS.
Stephen: OOPS, OF COURSE, ALSO THE RALLYING CRY OF ANYONE WHO DONATED MONEY TO HIS CAMPAIGN. BUT GOVERNOR PERRY HAD A VALID EXCUSE FOR FORGETTING, HE WAS HIGH. YOU SEE DUE TO A BAD BACK HE WAS ON PAINKILLERS. AND IT BECAME OBVIOUS PERRY WAS ON THE JUNK WHEN HE ASKED NEWT GINGRICH IF HE COULD HELP HIM BAKE THE COOKIES IN HIS HOLLOW TREE. BUT FOLKS, REMEMBER. THAT RICK PERRY THAT HIGH, OUT OF TOUCH RICK PERRY IS GONE. AFTER TWO YEARS OF AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL THE GOVERNOR HAS COMPLETELY REINVENTED HIMSELF WITH A PAIR OF GLASSES. HE CAN'T LOSE NOW I MEAN THOSE MAKE HIM LOOK SMARTER, MORE SERIOUS, AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MORE SERIOUS, AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- BUT PERRY, OOPS-- BUT PERRY, PERRY HAS ALSO MADE A MORE TROUBLING CHANGE, TO CURE HIS ACHING BACK SO HE CAN DIAL BACK THE PAINKILLERS, PERRY RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE HAD GIVEN UP ON COWBOY BOOTS.
YEAH, OH YEAH, YEAH. YES, YOU WERE MILDLY SHOCKED. I COULD TELL. YOU HEARD RIGHT, THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS SWEARING OFF COWBOY BOOTS. THAT'S LIKE THE GOVERNOR OF COLORADO TURNING HIS BONG BACK INTO AN APPLE. EVEN WORSE, EVEN WORSE, PERRY SPURNED HIS SPURS FOR PLAIN BLACK LOAFERS, NICE SHOES, DAD. EVEN WORSE, HE'S PAIRING THOSE LOAFERS WITH 2014'S LEAST APPEALING FASHION ACCESSORY, BARACK OBAMA. AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS ENRAGED, FOLKS, SO IS TEXAS LAND COMMISSIONER JERRY PATtERSON WHO COMPLAINED I LAMENT THE FACT THAT OUR GOVERNOR CAN NOW PASS FOR A WEST COAST METROSEXUAL. OH, OH, OH. MEOW! (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW WHAT A METROSEXUAL IS BUT I'M GUESSING THEY DON'T SAY, MEOW. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE AN ISSUE IN 2016, FOLKS. CONSERVATIVES RESPECT TRADITION. WHEN A MAN MAKES A COMMITMENT TO BOOTS ITS A COMMITMENT FOR LIFE. THAT'S WHY I'M STILL WEARING THESE BABIES I GOT WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE KISS ARMY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. I WILL NEVER TAKE THESE OFF. BECAUSE I WANT TO ROCK-AND-ROLL ALL NIGHT AND VISIT MY CHIROPRACTOR TWICE A WEEK BECAUSE THEY ARE KILLING ME. I THINK, I AM SO HIGH ON PILLS RIGHT NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
