[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, AN  ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMACARE. GOOD NEWS: EVERYTHING IS COVERED  IN-NETWORK. [LAUGHTER] BAD NEWS: THE NETWORK IS NBC. [LAUGHTER] THEN, A NEW WAY TO CELEBRATE  EARTH DAY. IF YOU'RE A PLANET, YOU WON'T  WANT TO MISS IT. [LAUGHTER] AND MY GUEST, SIGOURNEY WEAVER,  IS STARRING IN A NEW BROADWAY  SHOW BASED ON CHEKHOV. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS IN "STAR  TREK!" [LAUGHTER] THIS IS NOT "THE COLBERT  REPORT."  APRIL FOOLS-- THIS IS "THE  COLBERT REPORT." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. EXCELLENT JOB. FOR JUST A MOMENT THERE FOLKS,  IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT TO  DROP THE BALL IN MID JUGGLE BUT YOU GOT IT BACK. [LAUGHTER] GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US,  EVERYBODY. FOLKS, I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A  BLESSED EASTER, FULL OF  CHOCOLATE BUNNIES AND CHOCOLATE EGGS AND CHOCOLATE HAMS. [LAUGHTER] I DIDN'T ENJOY EASTER THIS YEAR. AND NEITHER DID THIS FRIEND OF  MINE NAMED JESUS. [LAUGHTER] TELL 'EM WHY, FOX.
A GROWING CONTROVERSY THIS  HOUR FOR GOOGLE.
THE SEARCH ENGINE GIANT  CHOOSES TO CELEBRATE LABOR  LEADER CESAR CHAVEZ WITH ONE OF THEIR FAMOUS DOODLES ON SUNDAY.
SOME CHRISTIANS ARE UPSET AT  GOOGLE NOW BECAUSE, IN FACT,  THEY'RE CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT. THEY DECIDED TO HONOR CESAR  CHAVEZ INSTEAD OF HONORING  EASTER. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: WHAT, WHAT WERE  THEY THINKING? HONORING THE FOUNDER OF THE  UNITED FARM WORKERS WHO SAID,  "THE TRUEST ACT OF COURAGE IS TO SACRIFICE YOURSELF FOR OTHERS."  THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  JESUS' CORE MESSAGE OF JELLY BEANS AND PLASTIC GRASS! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHY THIS BREAK WITH TRADITION? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. GOOGLE HAS ALWAYS HONORED  EASTER, EVERY SINGLE-- ONCE 13  YEARS AGO. [LAUGHTER] AND THEY CLEARLY HAVEN'T LEARNED  THEIR LESSON BECAUSE TODAY THEY  WENT BACK TO THEIR REGULAR LOGO INSTEAD OF HONORING APRIL  FIRST AS THE FEAST DAY OF SAINT  MELITO OF SARDIS, WHO DIED A  EUNUCH. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU. [LAUGHTER] IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO  HONOR HIM. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND DOODLE-GATE ISN'T THE ONLY  SCANDAL I FOUND IN MY BASKET. THIS IS EASTER UNDER ATTACK. ♪ ♪  POPE EDITION! FOLKS, I WAS WILLING TO GIVE  POPE FRANCIS A CHANCE, BUT IT'S  BEEN TWO WEEKS. [LAUGHTER] AND THERE'S BEEN ONE INSULT TO  TRADITION AFTER ANOTHER. FIRST, THE NIGHT HE WAS CHOSEN,  POPE FRANCIS EMERGED WEARING A  SIMPLE WHITE CASSOCK, INSTEAD OF THE TRADITIONAL ERMINE-TRIMMED  VELVET MOZZETTA. [LAUGHTER] COME ON! ARE YOU THE VICAR OF CHRIST, OR  THE SPOKESMAN FOR LINENS 'N'  THINGS? [LAUGHTER] NOW BENEDICT KNEW HOW TO ROCK  IT! I SAY YOU'RE NOT REALLY THE HEAD  OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH UNLESS  YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE IN A LIBERACE COVER BAND! [LAUGHTER] BUT IL PAPA SAVED HIS BIGGEST  INSULT FOR EASTER WEEKEND.
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN ONE  SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE THAT HAS  ANNOYED TRADITIONALISTS: THE WAY HE INCLUDED TWO WOMEN IN A HOLY  WEEK CEREMONY REPRESENTING THE  MOMENT WHEN CHRIST WASHED THE FEET OF HIS 12 DISCIPLES-- ALL  MEN.
SOME CHURCH CONSERVATIVES SAY  THE CHANGE SETS A BAD EXAMPLE.
SOME ARE SAYING WHY WERE  THERE WOMEN THERE?
Stephen: YEAH, WHY WERE THERE  WOMEN THERE? [LAUGHTER] IT WAS RE-ENACTING A EVENT FROM  THE NEW TESTAMENT. AND THERE ARE NO WOMEN IN THE  GOSPELS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S A COMMON MISTRANSLATION. JESUS WAS ACTUALLY BORN OF THE  VIRGIN MURRAY. [LAUGHTER] SO GET IT TOGETHER, YOUR  HOLINESS. BUST OUT THE BEDAZZLER AND LOSE  THE LADIES. OR SO HELP ME, I WILL CONTINUE  TO OBEY WHATEVER YOU SAY. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, EVERY DAY MORE AND MORE  FREELOADERS ARE SUCKING AT THE  GOVERNMENT TEAT. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING  SINCE UNCLE SAM IS A DUDE. THAT'S NOT EVEN COUNTING  OBAMACARE WHICH TAKES EFFECT IN  LESS THAN EIGHT MONTHS. DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? IF YOU GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM  NOW, YOU'LL BE COVERED BY THE  TIME YOU FINALLY SEE A DOCTOR. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE ALL VERY ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, OBAMACARE RAISES  ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID TO  133% OF THE POVERTY LINE,  ALLOWING IT TO COVER 30 MILLION MORE AMERICANS BY 2022. THIRTY MILLION MEDICAL MOOCHERS. [LAUGHTER] TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, IF  YOU LAID THEM ALL END TO END,  THEY WOULD STRETCH TO CANADA, WHICH IS WHERE THEY SHOULD MOVE  IF THEY WANT FREE HEALTHCARE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE  THEIR PART. THEY HAVE VOTED TO REPEAL  OBAMACARE 39 TIMES. ONE MORE AND THEY GET FREE  HEALTHCARE FOR LIFE. [LAUGHS] JUST KIDDING. THEY GET THAT NOW. [LAUGHTER] AND HERE'S OBAMA'S TRAP. THE FEDS ARE PICKING UP  100% OF THE COST OF EACH STATE'S  MEDICAID EXPANSION UNTIL 2017. BUT THEN, OVER THE NEXT FOUR  YEARS, THE PERCENTAGE THE FEDS  PAY PLUNGES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO  90%. [LAUGHTER] BY THEN, YOUR STATE IS HOOKED  LIKE A DIABETIC JONESING FOR HIS  INSULIN FIX. OH, THEY LOVE IT. GET HELP, JUNKIE! [LAUGHTER] LUCKILY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS  AREN'T FALLING FOR IT, LIKE  TENNESSEE GOVERNOR BILL HASLAM. UNDER OBAMACARE, 180,000 PEOPLE  FROM TENNESSEE WOL BE ADDED TO  HIS STATE'S  MEDICAID OR TENNCARE PROGRAM BUT HASLAM SAID NO, EXPLAINING,  "A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, 'HEY,  THAT'S AN EASY CALL. JUST EXPAND THREE YEARS 100% AND  THEN WALK AWAY AT THAT POINT IN  TIME.'  I DON'T THINK YOU CAN EASILY WALK AWAY. NO. DO YOU KNOW HOW HEARTBREAKING IT  IS TO TELL SOMEONE THEY'RE NO  LONGER GETTING HEALTHCARE? IT'S SO MUCH KINDER TO JUST TELL  THEM THEY'RE NEVER GETTING  HEALTHCARE. [LAUGHTER] BESIDES, THE GOVERNOR IS  CONFIDENT THAT TENNESSEE CAN GO  IT ALONE, BECAUSE TENNESSEE ALREADY HAS A GREAT PLAN FOR  GETTING AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO  THE THOSE WHO NEED IT:  A HEALTH CARE LOTTERY. TWICE A YEAR, RESIDENTS WHO HAVE  HIGH MEDICAL BILLS AND WHO  WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR TENNCARE CAN CALL A STATE PHONE  LINE AND REQUEST AN APPLICATION,  BUT THEY NEED TO DO IT QUICK, BECAUSE THE LINE SHUTS DOWN  AFTER 2,500 CALLS-- TYPICALLY  WITHIN AN HOUR. YES, FOR ONE HOUR, TWICE A YEAR  A FEW LUCKY PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED  TO LIVE. [LAUGHTER] I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME FOOTAGE.
COME ON DOWN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: DON'T FORGET. PLEASE SPAY OR NEUTER YOUR POOR. [LAUGHTER] NOW SINCE THE LINE IS ONLY OPEN  FOR AN HOUR, WOULD-BE APPLICANTS  ARE ENCOURAGED TO USE MULTIPLE PHONES, AND TO DIAL AND DIAL AND  DIAL. [LAUGHTER] YES, KEEP CALLING! AND IF YOU DO GET THROUGH, MAKE  SURE YOU SHOUT "TENNESSEE  TENNCARE HAS ALL THE HEALTHCARE HITS!"  AND YOU'LL WIN TWO TICKETS TO  SEE YOUR DERMATOLOGIST LIVE AT  THE BOURBON BLUES AND BOOGIE  BAR! [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, IF YOU MISS THE  WINDOW TO CALL IN, DON'T WORRY,  YOU CAN STILL GET MEDICAL ASSISTANCE BY SPEAKING TO  NURSE BRANDI FOR ONLY $2.99 A  MINUTE. SHE'S VERY THOROUGH. [LAUGHTER] AND IT IS A SELF SCAM -- SELF  EXAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NATION, I LOVE THIS HEALTHCARE  LOTTERY. IT FINALLY ADDS SOME SUSPENSE TO  THAT OLD, BORING QUESTION: "WILL  I SEE TOMORROW?" [LAUGHTER] WE SHOULD DO THIS EVERYWHERE. EVERY STATE CAN INTRODUCE  SOMETHING DIFFERENT. MAYBE A NEW LINE OF SCRATCH-OFF  SURGERY TICKETS. IT'S FUN! HERE RE GO. COLLAPSED LUNG. [ LAUGHTER ] COLLAPSED LUNG! CLOGGED ARTERY. DAMN! WELL, BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME IF  THERE IS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND TO COVER SKYROCKETING DRUG  COSTS, WE'LL HAVE A PRESCRIPTION  BOOTH! [LAUGHTER] GRAB AS MANY AS YOU CAN IN 30  SECONDS! WHO KNOWS, ONE OF THEM MIGHT  CURE YOU. AND THE OTHERS MIGHT GET YOU  HIGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW WILL THESE HEALTHCARE  LOTTERIES HELP EVERYONE? NO. BUT IF YOU DON'T GET THE CARE  YOU NEED, THERE IS A BACKUP  PLAN. YOU'LL AUTOMATICALLY BE ENTERED  IN A DIFFERENT LOTTERY. IF YOU GET THE BLACK DOT, ALL  YOUR PROBLEMS ARE OVER. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
