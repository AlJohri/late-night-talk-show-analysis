WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT PLAY A  COMBINATION OF POP, JAZZ AND SWING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BLUEGRASS. WHAT, NO  GREGORIAN CHANT?  PLEASE WELCOME LAKE STREET DIVE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. RACHEL, BRIGITTE, MIKE AND MIKE. OR IS IT ONE MICHAEL AND ONE MIKE?
I WOULD SAY MICHAEL SOMETIMES. McDUCK.
Stephen: McDUCK? ALL RIGHT.
I WILL GO MIKE NORDIC, MIKE ITALIAN. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT, OKAY, YOU ARE LAKE STREET DIVE. YOU GUYS EXPLODED THIS YEAR WITH A YOUTUBE VIDEO, EVERYBODY WATCHED. YOU DID A GREAT COVER OF I WANT YOU BACK BY THE JACKSON 5. ARE YOU ALSO THOSE WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY GUYS?
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT.
NO, OKAY.
WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THAT SUCCESS.
Stephen: OKAY I'M GONNA CUT THAT OUT. GOTTA CUT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE, ALRIGHT. FIRST TELEVISION APPEARANCE, TONIGHT.
VERY FIRST. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ARE YOU GUYS READY FOR THE BUMP?
YES.
Stephen: READY FOR THE COLBERT BUMP.
YES.
Stephen: WHERE DID YOU MEET?
IN COLLEGE AT THE NEW ENGLAND CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC IN BOSTON.
Stephen: WHAT IS A CONSERVATORY? IS THAT THE PLACE WHERE COLONEL MUSTARD KILLS YOU WITH A CANDLESTICK, WHAT IS THAT.
IT'S A PLACE WHERE, CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC IS WHERE YOU STUDY MUSIC AND YOU DON'T GENERALLY STUDY OTHER SUBJECTS. YOU STUDY JUST MUSIC.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
VERY FOCUSED.
Stephen: SO IS THIS CLASSICAL MUSICAL TRAINING.
WE STUDIED JAZZ.
Stephen: JAZZ. THEN WHY I DO LIKE YOUR MUSIC? [LAUGHTER]
WELL, WE TOOK OTHER INFLUENCES AND PUT THEM INTO THE MUSIC THAT WE MAKE.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. THIS, THE ALBUM IS CALLED BAD SELF PORTRAITS. AND WHAT DOES THAT NAME MEAN, IS THIS A MASHUP OF BOB DYLAN SELF-PORTRAIT AND MICHAEL JACKSON'S BAD? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, BAD SELF-PORTRAIT BECAUSE YOU ALL ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG PEOPLE. WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A BAD SELF PORTRAIT?
WELL, I THINK BAD SELF-PORTRAITS ARE SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE AROUND A LOT RIGHT NOW. IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE  STUPIDEST ZEITGEIST
Stephen: LIKE INSTAGRAM, PEOPLE SELFIES AND SEND THEM AROUND TO EVERYBODY.
YEAH, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE AND THEY'RE AWFUL. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: RIGHT.
WE NAMED OUR ALBUM AFTER THAT.
Stephen: YOU ALIENATED A FAIR AMOUNT OF OUR AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW. BUT THAT'S BRAVE, THAT IS VERY COURAGEOUS OF YOU.  IF YOU STUDIED JAZZ WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE PLAYING, YOU KNOW, WHAT DID YOU IMAGINE WOULD HAPPEN WITH YOUR CAREERS?
WE ALL THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE JAZZ MUSICIANS ORIGINALLY.
Stephen: SO YOU WERE GOING FOR THE BIG MONEY.
EXACTLY, YEAH.
BUT WE ON OUR FIRST TOUR ACTUALLY VERY FIRST TIME WE RAN A TOUR TOGETHER WE RODE AROUND AND MADE A PLAY LIST OF MUSIC WE COULD LISTEN TO TOGETHER WHILE YOU KNOW ON THOSE LONG STRETCHES BETWEEN CITIES AND YOU KNOW PAUL SIMON CAME UP A LOT, THE BEATLES CAME UP A LOT, BOB DYLAN CAME UP A LOT, SO WE WERE LIKE, HMM, LET'S DO THAT INSTEAD MAYBE.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. NOW RACHEL, YOU HAVE BEEN SINGING SINCE YOU WERE JUST A KID, RIGHT I'VE SEEN VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE OF WHEN YOU WERE 12.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: SINGING WITH THE CHOIR.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO DID YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE SINGING RELIGIOUS MUSIC THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE?
WELL, I, NO, NO, PROBABLY NOT.
Stephen: THAT WAS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ANSWER ON YOUR BEHALF. IS THERE A DISAPPOINTED PREACHER SOMEWHERE IN YOUR PAST?
NO, THERE'S NOT. MY PARENTS ARE VERY PROUD AND HAPPY.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD.
Stephen: DID I STRIKE A NERVE? [LAUGHTER] NO? OKAY. MIKE, I READ SOMEPLACE THAT YOU SAID THAT IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME,YOU WOULD PLAY THIS ALBUM TO YOUR YOUNGER SELF. WHY?
BECAUSE BACK TEN YEARS AGO WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND IF WE COULD JUMP FORWARD TO THIS TEN YEARS AGO, THEN WE WOULD BE A MUCH DIFFERENT BAND THEN WE WERE TODAY.
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO GET THIS STRAIGHT. [LAUGHTER] SO I JUST WANT, JUST SO I'M CLEAR, JUST SO I'M CLEAR. IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME YOU WOULD PLAY THIS TO YOURSELF, YOU WOULDN'T GO KILL HITLER. THIS IS YOUR FIRST CHOICE?  FIRST CHOICE, I'M STICKING WITH IT, FINAL ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S PRETTY BOLD.
Stephen: COULD YOU PLEASE DO A SONG.
YES.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. RACHEL PRICE. MIKE OLSEN, BRIDGET KIERNEY, MIKE CALABRESE,  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH LAKE STREET DIVE
