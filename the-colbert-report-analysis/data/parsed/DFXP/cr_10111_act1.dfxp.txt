Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. PLEASE, EVERYBODY, FIRST OFF, EVERYBODY AT HOME WATCHING RIGHT NOW, I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. BUT IF YOU ARE JUST-- IF ARE YOU JUST JOINING OUR BROADCAST ALREADY IN PROGRESS, YOU MAY BE NOTICING THIS. (LAUGHTER) THIS WILL ALL BE EXPLAINED LATER. (LAUGHTER) FOR NOW JUST ENJOY THE RIDE. (LAUGHTER) I KNOW I AM. BUT FIRST, FOLKS, IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA. AND I COULD NOT BE ANGRIER ABOUT IT. (LAUGHTER) I TRIED GETTING ANGRIER AND I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE I STARTED GETTING HAPPY ABOUT HOW ANGRY I WAS. (LAUGHTER)
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF MAJOR NEWS FROM OUR WAR IN AFGHANISTAN. FIRST WE'RE STILL FIGHTING IN AFGHANISTAN. (LAUGHTER) WHO KNEW THAT THING WAS STILL GOING. IT'S LIKE THE "GREY'S ANATOMY" OF WAR. (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS WEEKEND, THE CONFLICT GRABBED HEADLINES.
A U.S. SOLDIER CAPTURED BY THE TALIBAN FIVE YEARS AGO IS FREE AND HE'S COMING HOME. BOWE BERGDAHL, SERGEANT UNITED STATES ARMY. THE TALIBAN SNATCHED HIM WHILE ON DEPLOYMENT TO EASTERN AFGHANISTAN IN 2009. TODAY HE IS SAFE AND IN U.S. MILITARY HANDS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, AFGHAN VETERAN BOWE BERGDAHL IS SAFE UNLESS HE NEEDS THE VA HEALTH SYSTEM ANY TIME SOON. THEN, THEN THERE WILL BE A BIT OF A WAIT. BUT BERGDAHL'S FREEDOM WASN'T FREE. YOU SEE OBAMA NEGOTIATED BERGDAHL'S RETURN IN EXCHANGE FOR FIVE DETAINEES HELD AT GUANTANAMO BAY.
HE CAN'T RELEASE THESE GUYS. WE WERE THIS CLOSE TO CHARGING THEM WITH SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER) AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE WHO IS ABSOLUTELY ADAMANT ABOUT BOTH OF HIS FEELINGS ON THIS.
OBVIOUSLY WE SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR THE FAMILY. THEY'VE GOTTEN THEIR LOVED ONE BACK, THAT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. THE METHODOLOGY IN WHAT WE USED IS VERY TROUBLESOME, NEGOTIATING WITH TERRORISTS.
IT IS CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION WHEN AN AMERICAN IS RETURNED HOME. WE NEGOTIATED WITH TERRORISTS.
FIRST OF ALL, WE ARE ALL HAPPY THAT AN AMERICAN HAS BEEN RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY. THIS WAS NOT THE RIGHT THING.
YES IT IS A VICTORY AND A DEFEAT. THE WHOLE SITUATION HAS US PUMPING OUR FISTS WITH JOY WHILE SHAKING IT IN ANGER. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE, IT'S LIKE I'M MASTURBATING A TALL MAN ON A TRAMPOLINE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT IS A CELEBRATION THAT IS ALSO VERY TROUBLING. LIKE A PIZZA PARTY FOR HITLER'S BIRTHDAY. WAS IT FUN? YES. DO I REGRET IT? OF COURSE. (LAUGHTER) SO AS HAPPY AS I AM THAT SERGEANT BERGDAHL IS COMING HOME IT ALSO MEANS FIVE TERRORISTS ARE NOW FREE TO ROAM IN A TREELESS DESERT PATROLLED ONLY BY OUR PREDATOR DRONES. OH-- OH, WELL, YOU ENJOY THAT FREEDOM, FELLAS. NATION, I LOVE EVERY STATE IN AMERICA EQUALLY. I COULD NEVER PICK A FAVORITE BUT GUN TO MY HEAD, I'D CHOOSE FLORIDA. THE STATE WHERE I WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE A GUN TO MY HEAD. THE SUNSHINE STATE  PRODUCES-- SUNSHINE STATE PRODUCES SOME OF AMERICA'S MOST POPULAR LAWS LIKE STAND YOUR GROUND. A LAW THAT WILL LEAVE FUTURE FLORIDIANS WONDERING WHAT WAS GROUND? AND TONIGHT, I PROFILE ONE FLORIDIAN WHO DOESN'T JUST STAND HIS GROUND, HE STANDS YOUR GROUND. JIM?
THIS IS BIG PINE KEY FLORIDA. NEIGHBORLY, TRANQUIL-- WHAT THE [BLEEP]  THIS IS DOUG VARRIEUR. HE SHOOTS GUNS IN HIS YARD AND HE IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER LIKE SO MANY PATRIOTS BEFORE HIM DOUG VARRIEUR'S LOVE OF FREEDOM HAS RUFFLED A FEW FEATHERS. NO ONE LIKES HIM AT ALL. HE'S OBNOXIOUS, INCONSIDERATE, CRAZY.
OVERBEARING, EGO-CENTRIC
IGNORANT.
ANNOYING.
CRYSTAL CLEAR.
A REAL KOOK.
VERY PUSHY.
ASININE.
VERY CONFRONTATIONAL.
SELF-CENTERED.
HE HAS A TENDENCY TO ANNOY PEOPLE.
HE'S WACKO.
BUT WHAT SOME CALL WACKO, OTHERS CALL HEROIC-O BECAUSE DOUG IS JUST EXERCISING HIS SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS CLOSE TO HOME. COUNT US IN, DOUG.
3, 2, 1. I BUILT A TPA: A TARGET PRACTICE AREA. THE TARGET IS FOUR FOOT TALL 3 FOOT WIDE, 8 INCHES THICK.
THIS IS DOUG'S HOUSE. THIS IS DOUG'S YARD. THESE ARE DOUG'S NEIGHBORS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY TRAFFICKED CANALS ON BIG PINE KEYS. AND THIS IS MONROE COUNTY COMMISSIONER GEORGE NEUGENT.
THERE ARE VERY SAFE GUN RANGES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO DOUG'S HOME WHICH COULD DRIVE TO AND SHOOT HIS GUN THERE.
FROM WHERE I LIVE, AN INDOOR GUN RANGE IS JUST SIMPLY TOO FAR TO GO WHEN I CAN STAND IN MY SIDE YARD AND SHOOT ON MY OWN RANGE.
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO GET SHOT BECAUSE HE WON'T DRIVE 20 MINUTES TO A GUN RANGE.
WHY? FOR THE SAME REASON HE CAN FIRE TOWARDS KAYAKERS IN THE CANAL.
HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS HIS SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT AND HE WAS GOING CONTINUE TO DO IT.
THERE IS NOTHING ILLEGAL ABOUT ME SHOOTING IN MY BACKYARD. EVEN IF THERE IS A BOAT AND A KID.
HE'S 20 FEET FROM ONE OF THE BUSIEST CANALS ON BIG PINE KEY AND HE REALLY DIDN'T CARE. HE JUST TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY.
I DON'T CARE.
YOU RARELY FIND THAT KIND OF CIVIL DISCOURSE ANYWHERE IN AMERICA. BUT THIS ISN'T ANYWHERE, THIS IS FLORIDA.
OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT TOLD US THAT WE COULD NOT PREEMPT IN ANY WAY DOUG FROM FIRING THE WEAPON IN HIS BACKYARD.
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR YOU TO STOP ME. THE TRUTH IS, IF YOU DO STOP ME, THEN YOU'LL BE IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW, CAN BE REMOVED FROM YOUR JOB, FINED $5,000 AND HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY PUBLIC FUNDS FOR DEFENSE. THAT'S THE LAW. JUST BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
NO. WHAT MAKES IT RIGHT ARE DOUG'S STATE OF THE ART SAFETY PRECAUTIONS.
COUNT AGAIN 3, 2, 1.
MY TARGET PRACTICE AREA IS VERY, VERY SAFE.
CASE CLOSED.
IT IS NOT SAFE WHATSOEVER.
OH REALLY?
WELL, LISTEN  TO DOUG'S FOOLPROOF SECURITY SYSTEM.
BEFORE ANYBODY FIRES A SHOT, WE ASK FOR AN ALL-CLEAR FROM OUR LOOKOUTS.
THESE ARE DOUG'S LOOKOUTS. (LAUGHTER)
MOM AND DAD THEY'RE LOOKOUTS. SHE MAY SAY CLEAR OR MAY SAY GO, AND SHE MAY SAY NO. BEING 85 YEARS OLD, SHE BOUNCES AROUND.
YOU GOT THAT NERVOUS NELLIES. HOW MUCH SAFER DOES HE NEED TO GET.
NICE AND LOUD, ARE WE CLEAR.
YOU'RE CLEAR SON.
CLEAR.
RANGE IS HOT
RANGE IS HOT  IT'S DOUG'S ANTI-GUN NUT NEIGHBORS WHO ARE REALLY DISTURBING THE PEACE.
HIS NEIGHBORS ARE JUST GOING BAT [BLEEP] CRAZY, THERE'S A LOT OF SCREAMING GOING ON.
I THINK THE ONES THAT ARE AGAINST IT JUST DON'T LIKE GUNS.
I'M ALL FOR GUNS, I REALLY AM. I DO NOT HATE GUNS.
THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE HIS GUNS AWAY.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE HIS GUNS AWAY. I JUST DON'T WANT A BULLET IN MY HEAD WHILE I'M SITTING ON THE PORCH DRINKING A BEER AFTER A HARD DAY KILLING BUGS.
IF HE MISSES THE TARGET I'M ONLY AND IT COMES MY WAY, I'M ONLY 120 FEET AWAY FROM BEING SHOT.
SHE JUST GOES ON AND ON, DOESN'T SHE.
SO IS THERE ANY DOWNSIDE TO DOUG SHOOTING GUNS IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
IF YOU WERE TO MISS THE TARGET, IT'S POSSIBLE HE COULD SHOOT ONE OF HIS PARENTS.
I DON'T KNOW IF A RICOCHET BULLET WILL KILL ME. IF SO, I GUESS I'LL DIE. THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.
IF ONLY WE ALL COULD BE SO SENSIBLY RESIGNED TO THE ICY GRIP OF DEATH. FOR THE RECORD, DOUG, DO YOU EVER MISS.
DO I EVER MISS MY INTENDED TARGET? (LAUGHS)
GOOD ENOUGH. BUT SOME NAYSAYERS LIKE BIG GUN CLUB SAFETY OFFICER JORDAN WELLSHELL SAYS MISSING IS POSSIBLE.
EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT EVERYBODY MISSES THE TARGET. THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT HAVE COMPLETELY MISSED THE TARGET.
BUT EVEN IF HE DOES MISS, DOUG HAS A BACKUP SAFETY PLAN.
TO GIVE THE NEIGHBORS A SENSE OF SAFETY, I PUT THESE VEHICLES ON BOTH SIDES OF MY TARGET PRACTICE AREA.
THAT COMPLETELY BLOCKS --
I GOT A WALL BETWEEN ME AND THEN.
SATISFIED, NEIGHBORS? NOW THERE'S A WALL OF TRUCK.
AS FAR AS DOUG PARKING HIS TRUCK TO BLOCK ANY CHANCES OF A RICOCHET, PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA SEEING THE FACT THAT IT IS FULL OF FUEL.
YEAH THERE IS THAT.
♪HE FIRED HIS GUNS AND THE NEIGHBORS STARTED RUNNING ♪ ♪ HE FIRED ONCE MORE BUT THE LAW WON'T BE COMIN ♪  EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO ♪
I TRIPPED.
DIFFERENCE MADE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
