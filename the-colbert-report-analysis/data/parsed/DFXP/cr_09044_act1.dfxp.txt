[EAGLE CAW]
Stephen: TONIGHT, A SHIRTLESS  FUGITIVE IS FOUND IN FLORIDA  BY SWINGING A DEAD CAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN I PROFILE AN EXCITING NEW  TECHNOLOGY. I HOPE IT'S AN iPHONE THAT TELLS  YOU WHEN TO GET IN LINE FOR THE  NEW iPHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, MY GUEST JARED DIAMOND HAS  A NEW BOOK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN  LEARN FROM TRADITIONAL  SOCIETIES. IF IT'S HOW TO HANG A GOURD OFF  YOUR PENIS, I GOT THAT ONE  COVERED. [ LAUGHTER ] A SHIPMENT OF 18 HUMAN HEADS  SHOWED UP AT O'HARE  INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, WHEN I  CLEARLY SAID I WAS FLYING TO  OMAHA. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT."    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING TONIGHT'S  BROADCAST. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CROWD CHANTING "STEPHEN!"] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU  SO MUCH. IN HERE, OUT THERE, FOLKS, YOU  CAN FEEL THE ENERGY IN THIS ROOM  TONIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S ONE STORY ROCKING THIS NATION. A BOMBSHELL DROPPED BY MY HERO,  LANCE ARMSTRONG, MASTER OF THE  TWO WHEELER. RUMORS HAVE BEEN SWIRLING FOR  YEARS ABOUT LANCE, BUT UNLIKE  MOST AMERICANS, WHEN TIMES GOT TOUGH, I DIDN'T GET OFF THE  TANDEM BIKE OF ADMIRATION. NO! I SADDLED UP, RANG THE BELL OF  LOYALTY, PUT DOWN THE KICKSTAND  OF SUPPORT, STAYED IN IT TO SCHWINN IT, AND--  I'VE RUN OUT OF BIKE METAPHORS. [ LAUGHTER ] POINT IS, THE MAN'S  A HERO. HE BEAT CANCER. THEN WENT ON TO BEAT SOMETHING  EVEN LESS POPULAR:  THE FRENCH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELL, YESTERDAY HE FINALLY BROKE  HIS SILENCE IN AN EXPLOSIVE SIT  DOWN WITH OPRAH. NOW, IT DOESN'T AIR UNTIL  THURSDAY AND SECURITY AROUND THE  INTERVIEW HAS BEEN TIGHTER THAN LANCE'S PANTS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. SO, OF COURSE, ALL THE CABLE  NEWS NETWORKS ARE REPORTING IT. [ LAUGHTER ] LADY O REFUSES TO RELEASE ANY  CLIPS TO THE NEWS MEDIA, BUT  INSTEAD. SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER BEST  FRIEND GAYLE'S BEST CBS "THIS  MORNING" CO-HOST CHARLIE ROSE TO GIVE US HER REACTION TO WHAT SHE  WON'T TELL US LANCE SAID.
Stephen: WELL SORRY, OPRAH. I'M NOT PLAYING INTO YOUR LITTLE  P.R. STUNT. IF YOU WON'T TELL US WHAT  HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND LANCE,  I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A JOURNALIST TO MAKE SOMETHING UP. [ LAUGHTER ] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS JUST  IN:  LANCE ARMSTRONG BANGED OPRAH! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] JIMMY -- LET'S GO TO THE TAPE.
HE BROUGHT IT. HE REALLY DID. LITERALLY TWO AND A HALF HOURS. WE WERE BOTH PRETTY EXAUSTED. AND, UM, I WOULD SAY I WAS  SATISFIED. ABOUT AN HOUR AND 20 MINUTES IN,  WE TOOK A BREAK AND LANCE  ACTUALLY SAID, "WILL THERE BE A POINT WHERE YOU LIGHTEN UP?"  I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WAS  SATISFIED. WE'VE DECIDED THAT WE ARE  ACTUALLY GOING TO GO FOR TWO  NIGHTS. THE WORD I KEEP USING IS  SATISFIED. WHRAF LAUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Stephen: YES, SIR. SOUNDS LIKE LANCE GAVE HER A  ONE-NIGHT SUBSCRIPTION TO "O". [ LAUGHTER ] MORE ON THIS IF I HAVE TO  RELEASE THE TAPES! NATION, BEFORE WE GO ANY  FURTHER, I WANT TO WARN YOU:  THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT FEATURES GRAPHIC DEPICTION OF MONKEY. DANGEROUS PRIMATES ARE NOTHING  NEW IN THIS COUNTRY, GOING BACK  TO THE FAMED SCOPES MONKEY TRIAL, IN WHICH A MONKEY WAS  TRIED FOR SHOOTING CHARLES  DARWIN USING A HIGH-POWERED RIFLE SCOPE. [ LAUGHTER ] SINCE THEN, THE NATIONAL MONKEY  THREAT LEVEL HAS STAYED AS RED  AS A BABOON'S ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO I HAVE STAYED COMMITTED TO  INFORMING YOU ABOUT THOSE  THREATS IN MY  CRITICALLY-ACKNOWLEDGED SEGMENT "MONKEY ON THE LAM." [ LAUGHTER ] FOUR YEARS AGO TONIGHT, I WARNED  YOU ABOUT "THE MYSTERY MONKEY OF  TAMPA BAY."  THE MYSTERY BEING: WHY WOULD ANYBODY, EVEN A MONKEY, CHOOSE  TO LIVE IN TAMPA? [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, THIS OCTOBER AUTHORITIES  FINALLY NABBED THIS COLD-BLOODED  MAMMAL. TONIGHT WE TAKE YOU BEHIND THE  SCENES IN A COLBERT REPORT  EXCLUSIVE BECAUSE NO OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATION EVEN ASKED. [ LAUGHTER ] JIM? WE NEVER KNOW WHERE DANGER  LURKS. IT COULD BE DOWN THAT DARK ALLEY  OR HIDING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. AND IF YOU ARE IN TAMPA,  FLORIDA, IT CAN EVEN BE IN THE  TREES.
FOR THREE YEARS, POLICE HAVE  BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MONKEY  THAT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE WANDERED OFF A RESERVE 100 MILES  FROM TAMPA.
HE HAS BEEN BACK HERE IN MY  TREE. AND HE WILL START TO SHAKE THE  TREE.
Stephen: TONIGHT A STEPHEN  COLBERT SPECIAL REPORT:  MONKEY  ON THE LAM, EXTRA INVESTIGATION. 1381 DAYS OF TERROR IN TAMPA. DON McBRIDE WAS ONE OF  EARLIEST EYE WITNESSES.
I WAS IN A FAMILY ROOM EARLY  ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND I LOOKED  OUT AND HE WAS ON THE BIRD FEEDER TAKE OUT NUTS AND  BIRDSEED. HE LOOKED BACK THROUGH THE  WINDOW AT ME AND I WAS STARTLED.
THIS MONKEY WAS INTERESTED IN  MORE THAN JUST DON'S NUTS. THERE WERE SIGHTINGS ALL OVER  PINELLAS COUNTY.
THIS MONKEY WAS EVERYWHERE  AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY  THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAW THIS  MONKEY.
EMILY WAS THE TAMPA BAY TIMES  MONKEY BUREAU CHIEF. SHE HELPED AUTHORITIES PIECE  TOGETHER A PORTRAIT OF THE  FUGITIVE.
PEOPLE DESCRIBED HIM AS A  SQUIRREL OR MAYBE LIKE A CAT.
BROWN FUR. SORT OF A LIGHT PATCH IN THE  FRONT.
CARRIED ARMS AND SHARP TEETH. HE WAS SCARY LOOKING. [ LAUGHTER ] AS SIGHTINGS PILED UP OFFICIALS  KNEW IT WAS TIME TO CALL IN THE  MONKEY HUNTER. THROUGHOUT MY LIFETIME OF DOING  THIS I TRACKED DOWN HUNDREDS OF  MONKEY. VERNONATES IS A PROFESSIONAL  ANIMAL TRACKER. HE JOINED FORCES WITH LOCAL  VETERINARIAN DON WOODMANth FOR  A VETERINARIAN WHOP SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME IN THE OFFICE GIVING  VACCINATIONS TO CATS AND DOGS,  CHASING A MONKEY IS REALLY  EXCITING.
HE BRINGS THE MEDICAL PORTION  TO THE TABLE AND I BRING THE  EXPERIENCE AND ALMOST STIEWMEDITY THAT I WOULD GRAB  ALMOST ANY ANIMAL WITH MY HANDS  AND HANG ON TO HIM.
Stephen: BE CAREFUL WHAT  YOU GRAB THIS MONKEY ON THE  LOOSE IS ONE LOOSE MONKEY.
THE FEAR WAS THE MONKEY HAD  HERP YEZ.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, HERP  YEZHERPES. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION WHO IS  (bleep) OUR MONKEY. THIS WOULD CAUSE MINOR COLD  SORES IN MONKEYS.
Stephen: SO NOTHING TO  WORRY ABOUT.
BUT FIT GETS INTO PEOPLE IT  COULD CAUSE THE BRAIN TISSUE TO  MELT.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S BAD. BUT FOR THE NEXT THREE AND A  HALF YEARS DON AND VERNON FOUND  THEMSELVES CONTINUOUSLY MACA  KBLOCKED. THIS IS THE HARDEST MONKEY TO  CAPTURE.
WE'VE TRACKED HUNDREDS OF  MONKEYS AND NONE OF THEM THAT  PULL THE CHALLENGE LIKE THIS  ONE. I'LL GIVE HIM CREDIT KNOWING HOW  TO CROSS LOADS, STAYING OUT OF  POWER LINES. I GIVE HIM ALL THE CREDIT IN THE  WORLD FOR BEING EXTREMELY  INTELLIGENT.
Stephen: A CRIMINAL  MASTERMIND WITH A TOLERANCE FOR  DRUGS.
I HIT HIM WITH A DART WITH  ENOUGH DRUGS TO TAKE DOWN A  LINEBACKER HE PULLED IT OUT AND KEPT GOING.
Stephen: THE MONKEY  CONTINUED HIS REIN OF TERROR  TAKING ANOTHER SWIPE AT THIS GUY'S NUTS.
I HAD MY CAMERA CLOSE TO THE  DOOR. I PICKED IT UP AND I WAS READY.
Stephen: WHEN TAMPA  RESIDENTS SAW THE FOUNDED OUT OF  THIS HOUNDED MACACK THEY FOUND THEMSELVES LOCK INTO THE MIRROR  AS WELL.
THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE SAW THE  MONKEY AS BEING KIND OF LONELY  AND ON HIS OWN. AND IT WAS A SAD PHOTO. THIS WAS A MONKEY LOOKING FOR A  FRIEND.
Stephen: AREN'T WE ALL. PERHAPS IT WAS TIME TO FINALLY  LET THE MONKEY ROAM FREE. JUST LOOK AT HIM. WHAT IS THE WORST THAT COULD  HAPPEN.
MYSTERY MONKEY IS NOW  ATTACKING PEOPLE.
PROCEEDED TO BITE ME AND I  SWUNG HIM OFF. BUT HE IS STILL COMING TO MY  WINDOW AND LOCKING FOR ME.
Stephen: THE BEAST WAS OUT  OF CONTROL. IF THE MONKEY HUNTERS WERE GOING  TO SAVE TAMPA IT WAS NOW OR  NEVER. WE HAD OUR BANANAS OUT. HE GOT TO TO A CLEARING WHERE I  HAD A SHOT. SHOT.
I SAID I WOULD GET HIM AND I  FINALLY GOT HIM.
Stephen: AFTER FOUR YEARS  OF TERROR IT WAS TIME FOR THIS  MONKEY TO FACE THE MUSIC.
WE'RE GOING TO SEND HIM TO A  WILDLIFE SAINGTARY WHERE HE  COULD HOPEFULLY FROM FEMALE MONKEY COMPANIONSHIP.
FOR THIS THING TO GOOD ON, IT  CREATED ALL KINDS OF ANGER WHERE  YOU ALMOST DON'T GIVE A DAMN AND SAY EVENTUALLY I'LL GET HIM  BECAUSE MY HEART AND SOUL WENT  INTO CATCHING HIM.
Stephen: THANK YOU, VERNON. THANK YOU FOR FOUR WONDERFUL  YEARS OF MONKEY HUNTING. BECAUSE OF YOU AND DR. WOODMAN,  THE PEOPLE OF TAMPA WILL NEVER  LIVE IN MONKEY FEAR AGAIN.
THEY MAY HAVE CAUGHT THIS  MONKEY BUT I'VE SEEN THE MONKEY. I FOLLOWED THE MONKEY. I HAVE WRITTEN LOTS OF STORIES  ABOUT THE MONKEY. THIS MONKEY COULD ESCAPE AND GET  OUT AGAIN.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
