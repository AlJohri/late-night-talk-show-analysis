Stephen: TONIGHT, SCANDAL AT  PBS. DID SOMEONE ATDOWN TON GET  GRABBY IN THE ABEY. MY GUESTS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR  DARK GLOOMY MUSIC. I'LL TURN THEM ON TO THIS CRAZY  UNDERGROUND DRUG CALLED PROZAC. A MINNESOTA MAN FOUND A COMIC  BOOK INSIDE THE WALLS OF HIS  HOUSE THAT'S WORTH OVER  $100,000. IT'S ONLY VALUABLE IF YOU KEEP  IT IN ITS ORIGINAL WALL. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NATION, YOU KNOW, PLEASE...
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU PEOPLE ARE THE GREATEST. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS  LIKE I DO, YOU KNOW THAT THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS EMBROILED IN SO MANY SCANDALS  THAT TRYING TO PICK WHICH ONE TO  REPORT ON IS LIKE TRYING TO PICK WHICH OF YOUR CHILDREN TO  IMPEACH. NOW, FOR THE RECORD, IT'S THE  ONE WHO ATE CHIPS IN DADDY'S  DEN. YOU KNOW THE RULES. THANKFULLY, CONGRESS MADE THE  DECISION FOR ME TODAY BY PUTTING  THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE IRS WHO HAVE ADMITTED TO TARGETING TEA  PARTY GROUPS. NOW, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE  RESIGNATION OF ACTING  COMMISSIONER STEVEN MILLER, BUT HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER  BELIEVES WE CAN DO MORE.
MY QUESTION ISN'T ABOUT WHO  IS GOING TO RESIGN. MY QUESTION IS WHO IS GOING TO  JAIL OVER THIS SCANDAL.
Stephen: BOEHNER, OUT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE ABOUT 25  MINUTES OF SHOW LEFT TO DO. BUT, FOLKS, I'VE GOT TO SAY M.C. TANGERINE DREAM IS RIGHT. THIS IRS THING IS A JAILABLE  OFFENSE AND OBAMA KNOWS IT. I MEAN JUST LISTEN TO WHAT HE  SAID TO JOE BIDEN.
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS  MEANS? SCANDAL AND PRISON. THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. ONE OF US IS GOING TO JAIL. WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ME.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. WHO IS THAT SQUIRREL? WHAT DOES HE KNOW? IS HE CONNECTED TO ACORN? I WANT HIS NUTS ON A PLATTER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELL, FOLKS, TODAY CONGRESS  FINALLY HEARD FROM LOIS LERNER,  AN I.R.S. OFFICIAL AND I BELIEVE SUPERMAN'S EX-GIRLFRIEND. AND THE PERSON WHO FIRST  REVEALED THAT TEA PARTY GROUPS  WERE BEING TARGETED BY THE  I.R.S. FINALLY, AFTER WEEKS OF  DEMANDING ANSWERS WE IN CABLE  NEWS CAN STOP FILLING 24 HOURS WITH WILD, RIVETTING AND  ACTUALLY PLAUSIBLE THEORIES OF  INTERAGENCY CONSPIRACY AND JUST GET DOWN TO THE COLD, HARD FACTS  SO WE CAN END THIS RAMPANT AND  EXCITING SPECULATION. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT. SO, WHAT DID SHE SAY?
I'VE BEEN ADVISED BY MY  COUNSEL TO ASSERT MY  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOT TO TESTIFY OR ANSWER QUESTIONS  RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF  THIS HEARING.
Stephen: YES! I MEAN, WHAT? I MEAN, WITHOUT HER TESTIMONY,  WE'LL BE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT  OUR IMAGINATION.
WHY WON'T LERNER SPILL THE  BEANS ABOUT WHAT SHE KNOWS?
WHY IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO  HIDE AND YOU'RE A TRUTH TELLER  AND YOU'RE OF A SOUND MIND AND SHE SEEMS TO BE. WHY DOESN'T SHE SIT IN THAT  WITNESS STAND AND ANSWER  TRUTHFULLY? WHAT DOES SHE GOT TO BE AFRAID  OF?
THE SUSPICION IS GROWING THAT  SOMEONE OR OTHER THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION USED THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT TO GET  ITSELF RE-ELECTED IN 2012,  WHETHER IT WAS THE I.R.S. OR WHETHER IT WAS KNOCKING OUT CAR  DEALERSHIPS THAT BELONGED TO  REPUBLICANS.
REMEMBER GEORGE ORWELL'S  1984? THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS. SHE WANTS TO PROTECT HERSELF OR  SHE'S TAKING THE FIFTH BECAUSE  SHE WANTS TO PROTECT THE WHITE  HOUSE. DOES SHE HAVE A FEAR FOR THE  WHITE HOUSE OR A FEAR FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE?
IS IT SNOWING? IS IT SHE KNOWS SHE'S DONE  SOMETHING WRONG THAT ONLY  AFFECTS THE I.R.S.? OR IS IT SHE KNOWS THERE'S  SOMETHING WRONG THAT GOES ABOVE  HER?
Stephen: YES, DOES SHE KNOW? AND WHAT DOES SHE KNOW? AND HOW DO WE KNOW SHE.
S WHAT SHE KNOWS? AND DID OBAMA KNOW WHAT SHE  KNOWS THAT SHE KNEW? AND WHAT ABOUT JOHN SUNUNU? AND, FOLKS, ULTIMATELY IS ALL  THIS JUST A WAY TO COVER UP THE  FACT THAT SOLYNDRA SOLD SOLAR PANELS TO THE CONSULATE IN  BENGHAZI USING THE ASSOCIATED  PRESS AS A MULE TO SMUGGLE GUNS INTO MEXICO AS PART OF FAST AND  FURIOUS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANKS TO MRS. LERNER'S REFUSAL  TO TESTIFY, THAT'S AS ACCURATE  AS I NEED TO BE. NOW, NATION, SOMETIMES I FEEL  LIKE A LONE VOICE CRYING IN THE  WILDERNESS. THEN I PUT MY GLASSES BACK ON  AND REALIZE THESE TREES ARE  ACTUALLY JUST CAMERAS. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FOLKS, OF COURSE, I DON'T HAVE  TO REMIND YOU THAT WE ARE LOSING  THE WAR ON MARIJUANA, UNLESS YOU'RE A DOPER, IN WHICH CASE  YOU HAVE THE SHORT-TERM MEMORY  OF A SAND CRAB. AND THIS WEEK THE POT PROBLEM  ONLY GOT WORSE.
KENTUCKY'S TWO SENATORS SAY  THEY ARE NOT GIVING UP ON  INDUSTRIAL HEMP. SENATORS MITCH McCONNELL AND  RAND PAUL WERE JOINED BY SEVERAL  KENTUCKY CONGRESSMEN IN SIGNING A LETTER TO THE, A MEASURE THAT  WOULD ALLOW INDUSTRIAL HEMP  FARMING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LIFTS ITS CURRENT  RESTRICTIONS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THESE SENATORS ARE TRYING TO  TURN KENTUCKY INTO A DEN OF THIN  INSTEAD OF A WHOLESOME PLACE TO POUND BURBON WHILE WATCHING TINY  PEOPLE WHIP HORSES FOR SPORT. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I'M GIVING A  WAG OF MY FINGER TO SENATORS  MITCH AND CHONG HERE. OF COURSE, THESE KENTUCKY  KEN-TOKERS ARE SAYING HEMP IS  DIFFERENT FROM MARIJUANA BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ALMOST NO T.H.C. AND  IS USED TO MAKE SUSTAINABLE  PRODUCTS LIKE ROPE AND PAPER. IN FACT WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS  SUPPORT FOR HEMP RAND PAUL SAID  QUOTE, "I'M FASCINATED BY THE PAPER THING. ONE ACRE OF HEMP IS EQUAL TO TWO  ACRES OF TREES. TREES TAKE 15 YEARS AND HEMP ONE  SEASON. SOMEBODY SAID THE DECLARATION OF  INDEPENDENCE IS IS ON HEMP  PAPER. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR  NOT. I'VE HEARD IT THOUGH."  SADLY, FOLKS... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SADLY, PUFF THE MAGIC SENATOR  HERE MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING  ABOUT THE DECLARATION BEING WRITTEN ON HEMP. IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY IT'S SIGNED  BY FOUNDING FATHERS JOHN  HANCOCK, BEN FRANKLIN AND ZEPPELIN RULES. NEXT UP, FOLKS, EVERYBODY LOVES  DISNEY WORLD. THE RIDES, THE COSTUMES, THE  WALT-SICLES. SO MUCH FUN. BUT WIN THING RUINS THE DISNEY  MAGIC AND THAT'S THE LONG LINES. FORTUNATELY IF YOU'VE GOT THE  CASH, THERE'S A WAY TO GET A  JUMP ON THE RIFFRAFF.
CASTING LIGHT ON HOW THE RICH  HIT DISNEY WORLD. THE NEW YORK POST REPORTS  THEY'RE HIRING DISABLED PEOPLE  TO POSE AS FAMILY MEMBERS SO THEY CAN JUMP TO THE FRONT OF  THE LINES WITH THEIR KIDS. THE BLACK MARKET DISNEY GUIDES  RUN $130 AN HOUR OR JUST OVER  $1,000 A DAY.
Stephen: YES, SKIP LINES BY  HIRING THE DISABLED OR JUST GO  TO THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS AND STEAL F.D.R. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM GIVING  THE NEXT TIP OF MY HAT TO  RESOURCEFUL RICH FOLK. TRAVELING WITH THE SPECIAL NEEDS  SET DOES BRING SPECIAL PERKS.
ONE MOM SPEAKING OUT THIS  MORNING HAS NO SHAME IN HER  GAME. SHE SAYS, HEY, MY DAUGHTER  WAITED ONE MINUTE TO RIDE IT'S A  SMALL WORLD. THE OTHER KIDS HAD TO WAIT MORE  THAN TWO HOURS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT,  LOSERS. THANKS TO HER LITTLE HANDY-PAL,  THAT LITTLE GIRL JUST BLEW PAST  YOUR SORRY ASSES SO SHE COULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR A MESSAGE OF  UNITY AND UNDERSTANDING. SUCKS TO BE YOU! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT? NOW THAT IT'S OUT THERE, I HAVE  AN ADMISSION TO MAKE. I TOO HAVE BEEN HITCHING A RIGHT  ON THE GRAVY WHEELCHAIR. IN FACT, TO GET SPECIAL STUFF I  HAVE A WHOLE STABLE FULL OF  HANDICAPPEDDED PEOPLE. I MEAN NOT LITERALLY. IT'S HEATED. THANKS TO THEM, I GET THE BEST  PARKING SPOTS. I'M ALWAYS FIRST TO BOARD THE  PLANE. AND OH, THE WISHES THEY MAKE. I MET MICHAEL JORDAN. I GOT A TOUR OF NASA. I SEEN SWAM WITH DOLPHINS. IT'S A REAL SHAME, IT'S A REAL  SHAME THAT THE KID'S DOCTORS  SAID HE COULDN'T GET IN THE WATER CAUSE OF HIS THING. BUT HE STILL HAD FUN. I SPRAYD HIM WITH A SUPER  SOAKER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
