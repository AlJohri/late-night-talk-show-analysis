Stephen: TONIGHT, HOW IS  TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTIONIZING WALL  STREET? NOW YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LIFE  SAVINGS IN HI DEF. (LAUGHTER)  AND MY GUEST, WRITER TONY  KUSHNER PENNED THE SCREENPLAY TO  THE MOVIE "LINCOLN." NO ONE TELL ME HOW IT ENDS. (LAUGHTER)  AN OIL PAINTING ON BOB BARKER IS  ON EBAY FOR $3.5 MILLION. I BID ONE DOLLAR. (LAUGHTER)  THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT"  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by  COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: GOOD TO HAVE YOU  WITH US! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT. WELCOME TO THE "REPORT."  I'VE GOT TO THANK YOU PEOPLE FOR  STANDING WITH ME AND STANDING BY ME AND STANDING BEHIND ME  BECAUSE FOR SEVEN YEARS RUNNING  THE "REPORT" HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE CABLE NEWS SHOW ON THIS  NETWORK AT 11:30. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S OFFICIAL. I JUST FOUND THAT OUT. FOLKS, YOU DON'T GET TO THE TOP  WITHOUT MAKING A FEW ENEMIES. SO ONCE AGAIN IT'S TIME FOR  "WHO'S ATTACKING ME NOW?"  (LAUGHTER)  TONIGHT I AM ONCE AGAIN IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF THE CANADIAN  PRESS. (BOOS)  IT SEEMS THAT THE MAPLE STREAM  MEDIA HAVE THEIR MITTENS IN A  BUNCH OVER SOMETHING I SAID IN MY NEW BOOK "AMERICA AGAIN:  REBECOMING THE GREATNESS WE  NEVER WEREN'T."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS THING MAKES A GREAT  CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR WHEREVER  CANADIAN PRIS MASS IS. HERE IT'S DECEMBER 25, THE I  KNOW EVERYTHING IS METRIC UP  THERE SO I'M GOING TO SAY THE 57.2 EIGHTH OF KILOVEMBER. ACCORDING TO THE CANADIAN  BROADCASTING CORPORATION, FOX IN  CANADA ARE OOTRANGED ABOUT MY CHAPTER OF ENERGY WHERE I SAY  "BEFORE WE CAN HARNESS  GEOTHERMAL POWER WE HAVE TO TAKE THE PLANET'S TEMPERATURE WITH A  GEOTHERMOMETER AND I HAVE NO  IDEA WHERE THE EARTH'S RECTUM IS."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND THE FOOTNOTE READS "WINDSOR,  CANADA."  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) OKAY, NOW DON'T GET THEM A TWIST  CANUCKS. THAT'S A MISQUOTE. THE FOOTNOTE ACTUALLY READS  "WINDSOR, CANADA?"  QUESTION MARK! IT'S A QUESTION. AS A JOURNALIST, IT'S MY JOB TO  ASK THESE PROBING QUESTIONS. COULD THE EARTH'S RECTUM BE  WINDSOR? I DON'T KNOW. IT COULD JUST AS EASILY BE  WINNIPEG. (LAUGHTER)  BESIDES, OKAY, THIS COULD BE A  NET POSITIVE FOR WINDSOR. JUST LOOK AT THIS ACTUAL POLL AT  THE BOTTOM OF THE CANADIAN  BROADCASTING CORPORATION'S  ARTICLE. "IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S  DESCRIPTION OF WINDSOR AS THE  EARTH'S RECTUM GOOD OR BAD FOR THE CITY?"  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  THIS IS TRUE. AS OF THIS TAPING THE RESULTS  ARE 76.64% GOOD AND 23% BAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  APPARENTLY THE EARTH'S RECTUM IS  AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WINDSOR'S PREVIOUS REPUTATION SO YOU'RE  WELCOME, WINDSOR. YOU JUST GOT THE COLBERT BUMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DO YOU AGREE TO MAKE THIS YOUR  NEW CITY FLAG AND CHANGE  YOURTORYIST SIGNS. "WELCOME TO WIND OR, YOU TAINT  SEEN NOTHING YET."  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, WALL STREET IS TAKING A LOT OF HEAT LATELY. YOU DESTROY THE GLOBAL ECONOMY  ONCE AND EVERYONE FORGETS ALL  THE TIMES YOU DIDN'T DESTROY IT. (LAUGHTER)  PLUS OUR FINANCE SECTOR IS MUCH  SAFER NOW BECAUSE WALL STREET  HAS REMOVED THE WEAKEST LINK--  MAN.
FOR 150 YEARS, THE FLOOR OF 2  T CHANGE WAS THE CENTER OF THE  FINANCIAL WORLD. BUT LESS THAN 30% OF THE TRADING  IS CONDUCTED HERE NOW AND THE  SPECIALISTS IN THE NOISE OF THE FLOOR IS BEING REPLACED BY THE  SPEED AND QUIET EFFICIENCY OF  COMPUTERS.
Stephen: THOUGH HUMANS STILL  PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE-- AS SEEN  HERE AS GOLDMAN SACHS. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, FOLKS, SUPERFAST COMPUTERS  ARE NECESSARY FOR SOMETHING  CALLED HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING OR H.F.T. OR HFT" THE SOUND OF YOUR  PENSION EVAPORATING. COMPUTERS CAN MOVE MILLIONS OF  SHARES AROUND IN MINUTES EARNING  A TENTH OF A PENNY OFF EACH  SHARE. THAT ADDS UP TO SERIOUS MONEY  WHEN THEY FINALLY TAKE IT DOWN  TO THE WALL STREET COINSTAR. (LAUGHTER)  AND ONCE THE COMPUTER HAS A  TRADING STRATEGY OR ALGORITHM IT  MAKES MONEY JUST BY CHURNING THE SAME FORMULA OVER AND OVER  AGAIN. LIKE MAROON 5. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND EVEN SIMPLE ALGORITHM CANS  DRAMATICALLY INFLUENCE THE  MARKET. EARLIER THIS FALL A SINGLE  MYSTERIOUS COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT  PLACED ORDERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELED THEM MADE UP 4% OF ALL  QUOTE TRAFFIC IN THE U.S. STOCK  MARKET. THAT'S RIGHT. ONE ALGORITHM IS 4% OF ALL  TRADES. THE OTHER 96% WERE PEOPLE  DUMPING FACEBOOK STOCK. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE SOURCE OF THAT  MYSTERIOUS ALGORITHM IS UNKNOWN  BUT EXPERTS SUSPECT IT WAS DESIGNED TO GUM UP THE SYSTEM SO  IT SLOWS DOWN OTHERS AND ALLOWS  THE COMPUTER TRADERS TO GAIN A MONEY-MAKING OPPORTUNITY. IN OTHER WORDS, NOT ONLY WAS HE  FAST, HE MADE EVERYONE ELSE  SLOWER. LIKE IF INSTEAD OF JUST DOPING  LANCE ARMSTRONG ALSO MADE  EVERYONE ELSE EAT A TURKEY  DINNER. (LAUGHTER)  NOW SOME SAY --  (APPLAUSE)  SOME SAY ALL THIS --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY STILL LOVE YOU, LANCE. NOW, SOME SAY ALL THIS COMPUTER  TRADING IS DANGEROUS BUT I SAY  IT'S ACTUALLY SAFER BECAUSE IF THE STOCK MARKET EVER CRASHES  AGAIN, INSTEAD OF BROKERS  JUMPING OUT OF WINDOWS IN A PANIC THEY'LL SIMPLY TURN ON  THEIR COMPUTER AND SEE THE  SOOTHING MESSAGE "ERROR 404, ECONOMY NOT FOUND."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BECAUSE, REALLY, WHAT'S THE  WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN? HERE TO TELL US THE WORST THAT  COULD HAPPEN IS THE AUTHOR OF  "AUTOMATE THIS: HOW ALGORITHMS CAME TO RULE THE WORLD."  PLEASE WELCOME CHRISTOPHER  STEINER. THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NICE TO MEET YOU. OKAY. NOW WE HAVE THE BOOK HERE  "AUTOMATE THIS: HOW COMPUTERS  CAME TO RULE THE WORLD." HOW DID THEY COME TO RULE THE  WORLD? HOW MUCH TRADING ARE WE TALKING  ABOUT? JUST A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT?
SURE, SURE. AT LEAST HALF EVERYDAY. SOME DAYS AS MUCH AS 70%. WHEN THIS STARTED, THOUGH, IT  WAS KIND OF A GOOD THING. IT WAS A DEMOCRATIZING MOVEMENT  IN THE STOCK MARKET. IT USED TO BE IN THE EARLY '90s  IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE A TRADE  YOU HAD TO CALL UP A BROKER AND MAYBE YOUR TRADE WOULD GET  EXECUTED IN A COUPLE HOURS. NOW YOU CAN SIT AT YOUR KITCHEN  TABLE AND BAM, $7, YOU MAKE A  TRADE. WELL, WE HAVE THAT ABILITY AND  THAT MESSAGE --.
Stephen: THAT MESSAGE GOES TO  A TALKING BABY. (LAUGHTER)
YES. WE HAD THAT TEN YEARS AGO BUT  THINGS HAVE GOTTEN SO OUT OF  CONTROL THAT THE THING LIMITING THESE ALGORITHMS NOW IS THE  SPEED OF LIGHT. IT'S TOO SLOW. SO THEY'RE NOW USING  MICROWAVES-- WHICH IS ALSO THE  SPEED OF LIGHT-- TO TRADE  BETWEEN CHICAGO AND NEW YORK. A LOT OF THESE TRADES BOUNCE  BACK BETWEEN CHICAGO AND NEW  YORK. BEFORE THEY USED MICROWAVES A  BUNCH OF GUYS --.
Stephen: MICROWAVES, LIKE  HEAT UP YOUR COFFEE MICROWAVE?
IT'S A RADIO SIGNAL THAT  THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING  MOUNTAINS FOR SO THEY CAN GET A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN CHICAGO  AND NEW YORK.
Stephen: IN OTHER WORDS THEY  WANT TO MAKE THESE TRADES SO  FAST THAT THE ULTIMATE SPEED OF THE UNIVERSE, THE SPEED OF  LIGHT, IS NOT FAST ENOUGH?
IT'S NOT FAST ENOUGH. SO THERE ARE NOW SHIFTS THAT  EXECUTE TRADES IN NANO SECONDS. AND DURING A NANO SECOND THE  SPEED OF LIGHT TRAVELS 13  INCHES. SO THAT -- YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE  IN THREE NANO SECONDS SO NOW  THEY PUT THE COMPUTERS FOR THESE TRADERS AT THE EXCHANGES.
Stephen: SO THEY'RE TRYING TO  PUT THE COMPUTERS LITERALLY 13  INCHES FROM THE EXCHANGE?
IT'S GOT TO BE AT THE  EXCHANGE. SO THE EXCHANGES NOW CHARGE  THESE HIGH SPEED TRADEERS MONEY  TO PUT THEIR COMPUTERS THERE. SO THIS IS A BIG SOURCE OF  REVENUE FOR THE EXCHANGES SO  THEY ARE TETHERED TO THIS THIS SOURCE OF REVENUE. SINCE THEY DON'T WANT TO STOP  WHAT HAS BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS  THING IN THAT WE CAN LOSE A TRILLION DOLLARS IN TEN  MINUTES-- WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED  ON THE FLASH CRASH.
Stephen: THE FLASH CRASH IS  SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN --
2010.
Stephen: OKAY. 2010. THE MARKET AN ENORMOUS DIVE AND  THEN IT RECOVERED AND NO ONE  REALLY KNOWS WHAT CAUSED IT,  RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, THE S.E.C. BLAMED  SOME GUY OUT IN KANSAS BUT --  YOU KNOW, I -- WHAT DOES KANSAS HAVE TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS,  RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW! IT'S YOUR FAULT. I DON'T KNOW.
THEY BLAMED A MUTUAL THAT  USED AN ALGORITHM THAT DUMPED  FUTURES ON THE EXCHANGE IN CHICAGO TOO QUICKLY. BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHAT YOU  WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT EARLIER,  THE 4% OF THOSE TRADES, MOST OF THOSE TRADES WERE FAKE, RIGHT? THEY WERE FAKE. SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FLASH  CRASH IS THE PIPES TO THESE  EXCHANGES WERE SO FULL OF FAKE TRADES THAT THE WHOLE THING  SLOWED DOWN. NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON  UNTIL TEN MINUTES PASSED.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE ONE STEP  BACK HERE. I ALREADY EXPLAINED TO THE RUBES  IN THE AUDIENCE WHAT AN  ALGORITHM IS, OKAY? BUT WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM? (LAUGHTER)  WHAT ARE THESE THINGS THAT ARE  DOING THIS THING?
AN ALGORITHM IS VERY SIMPLE,  REALLY. JUST A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT  TELLS THE COMPUTER WHAT TO DO  WITH A PIECE OF INFORMATION. SO INFORMATION GOES IN, OUTPUT  COMES OUT. A SIMPLE ALGORITHM WOULD BE ONE  THAT PLAYS TIC-TAC-TOE. THE INPUT ARE THE THE MOVES THAT  THE HUMAN, THE OUTPUTS ARE THE  MOVE OF THE COMPUTER.
I KNOW A CHICKEN IN CHINA  THOOUN CAN DO THAT, TOO. (LAUGHTER)
SO THE ALGORITHMS ON WALL  STREET ARE SIMILAR.
THEY'RE LIKE REALLY BIG  CHICKENS?
REALLY BIG CHICKENS THAT MAKE  COMPLICATED TRADES. BUT THEY DO IT SO QUICKLY THAT  YOU CAN LOSE CONTROL OF THE  STOCK MARKET IN LITERALLY 30  SECONDS.
Stephen: IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S  A GREAT THING FOR BIG INVESTORS  OR HUGE INVESTORS OR GARGANTUAN  INVESTORS. WHAT ABOUT THE AVERAGE INVESTOR? SHOULD WE EVEN BE IN THERE  ANYMORE? CAN WE COMPETE? CAN WE GET OUR OWN ALGORITHM? IS THERE AN APP FAR? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS THE APPS  ARE SO EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU  HAVE TO PUT YOUR COMPUTER AT THE EXCHANGE AND YOU HAVE TO BUY  THESE GIANT DATA FEEDS THAT  NORMAL PEOPLE CANNOT RUN THESE.
SO IF I'VE GOT MONEY IN THE  STOCK MARKET AND I'M JUST AN  AVERAGE GUY-- LIKE I AM, AN AVERAGE JOE-- SHOULD BY PULLING  IT OUT AND DOING SOMETHING SAFER  WITH IT, LIKE PUTTING IT ON BLACK AT A ROULETTE WHEEL OR  STUFFING IT INTO A SOCK AND  THROWING IT INTO THE OCEAN? (LAUGHTER)
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS  PROBLEM -- IT EXISTS FOR BOTH  THE BIGGEST INVESTORS AND THE SMALLEST INVESTORS BECAUSE  THEY'RE ONE IN THE SAME A LOT OF  TIMES. THEY'RE ALL IN MUTUAL FUNDS AND  WHEN A MUTUAL FUND WANTS TO MAKE  A MOVE, IT'S A VERY BIG MOVE. IT'S USUALLY LET'S BUY A MILLION  SHARES OF I.B.M. OR WHATEVER IT  IS AND ALL THESE ALGORITHMS ARE OUT THERE SNIFFING AROUND FOR  THESE BIG ORDERS.
Stephen: ARE THEY SELF-AWARE? IS THIS "THE MATRIX"? (LAUGHTER)  ARE YOU KEANU REEVES? DO YOU KNOW KUNG FU?
I WISH I DID.
Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU FOR  JOINING ME. CHRISTOPHER STEINER. THE BOOK IS "AUTOMATE THIS."  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
