Stephen:  TONIGHT, OUR  EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS HAVE NEW  ANSWERS WHICH WE COPIED OFF THE  CHINESE KID IN FRONT OF US. ( LAUGHTER )  THEM OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS ARE  IN TROUBLE. SOMEONE MUST HAVE TOLD THEM THEY  WERE ADOPTED. ( LAUGHTER ). PLUS MY GUEST NAOMI WOLF HAS A  NEW BOOK CALLED "VAGINA."  NOW I'M NO ENGLISH MAJOR BUT I  DETECT A SUBTLE SEXUAL SUBTEX. ( LAUGHTER ). THE NEW YORK AQUARIUM HAS A NEW  BABY WALRUS-- GREAT, ANOTHER  BROOKLYN HIPSTER WITH A  RIDICULOUS MUSTACHE. ( LAUGHTER ). THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  AWFULLY NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT, GOOD TO  HAVE YOU WITH US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS KIND  OF THAT TIME OF YEAR TO ASK THE  QUESTION IS THIS NOT-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  , PLEASE, PLEASE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE COULD  POWER MY WHOLE VILLAGE IF WE  COULD JUST PUT SOME JUMPER  CABLES ON YOUR NIPPLES RIGHT NOW AND IT'S CHILLY ENOUGH TO DO SO  IN THIS ROOM. FOLKS, ISN'T THIS A GREAT  CAMPAIGN?  ♪ EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROMNEY   ♪ ♪  THE LATEST POLLS HAVE ROMNEY  NECK AND NECK WITH OBAMA. FOLKS, THIS RACE IS AS TIGHT AS  MITT'S SMILE WHEN HE MEETS A  POOR PERSON. ( LAUGHTER )  ( LAUGHTER )  UNFORTUNATELY, UNFORTUNATELY,  FOLKS, THERE'S STILL ONE POLL  OUT THERE THAT GIVES PAUM A  CHANCE.
7-ELEVEN STORES ARE GIVING  VOICE TO THE PEOPLE BY OFFERING  A CHOICE OF COFFEE CUBS IN OBAMA BLUE OR ROMNEY RED. THE COMPANY SAYS THE VOTES  PEOPLE CAST NATIONALLY CAN BE  USED AS VALUABLE POLLING DATA.
Stephen:  YES. IN 7-ELEVEN'S CUP HOLE, RIGHT  NOW, OBAMA IS UP BY 20 POINTS  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NO, FOLKS, WAIT A SECOND. ARE WE SURE THEY'RE NOT USING  FOUR--YEAR-OLD DATA? BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE  USING FOUR-YEAR-OLD HOT DOGS. WHAT IS TERRIFYING ABOUT THIS IS  THE 7-ELEVEN CUP POLL IS  UNCHARACTERLY ACCURATE.
DID YOU KNOW THIS PROMOTION  ACTUALLY LINED UP PERFECTLY WITH  THE RESULTS OF A 2004 AND 2008  ELECTIONS?
Stephen:  AND WHO CAN  FORGET IN 2010 WHEN THEY  ACCURATELY PREDICTED THE  ELECTION OF SENATOR SHREK? ( LAUGHTER )  NATION, I CALL BIAS ON 7-ELEVEN. THEIR ENTIRE POLL HAS A MARGIN  OF ERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS  MORMONS CAN'T DRINK COFFEE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GOING  ON HERE? YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON  HERE, FOLKS? VOTER FRAUD. OH, YEAH. WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE DRINK  7-ELEVEN COFFEE? FOLKS, WE MUST REQUIRE VOTER  I.D. BEFORE ANYONE CAN BUY A CUP  OF JOE. I AM SURE 7-ELEVEN WILL BE JUST  AS RIGOROUS ABOUT CHECKING  I.D. FOR CUPS AS THEY ARE FOR  BEER AND CIGARETTES. BUT ULTIMATELY, BEVERAGE-BASED  POLLING, I BELIEVE, DEMEANS OUR  POLITICAL PROCESS. THANKFULLY, NEXT WEEK, THERE'S  ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. IT'S A TOWN HALL FORMAT WHICH  MEANS AVERAGE CITIZENS WILL HAVE  A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME CHANCE TO  ASK THE MOST POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD ABOUT THE MOST VITAL  ISSUES FACING OUR NATION. OR ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE  ( LAUGHTER )
PIZZA HUT IS GOING TO BE  GIVING FREE PIZZA FOR LIFE TO  ANY CUSTOMER WHO ASKS PRESIDENT  OBAMA OR MITT ROMNEY IF THEY PREFER SAUSAGE OR PEPPERONI  PIZZA AT THE UPCOMING DEBATE.
Stephen:  THAT'S RIGHT. WHOEVER USES THEIR BRIEF TIME AT  THE NATIONAL MIC TO ASK THE  CANDIDATES, SAUSAGE OR  PEPPERONI, WILL RECEIVE FREE PITA HUT PIZZA FOR LIFE. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THAT'S  MEANT TO BE A REWARD. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  BECAUSE IT'S DELICIOUS  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I LOVE IT. I EAT IT. I EAT IT ALL THE TIME. AND SO SHOULD YOU. NOW, FOLKS THEY SAY FOR LIFE,  BUT THE QUESTIONER WILL ACTUALLY  RECEIVE THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE  FREE PIZZA PER WEEK FOR 30  YEARS. WHICH I THINK IS PITA HUT'S WAY  OF SAYING IF YOU EAT ONE OF  THEIR PIZZAS EVERY WEEK, YOU  WILL DIE IN 30 YEARS.   ( APPLAUSE )   SO JUST WHAT MOTIVATED-- JUST  WHAT MOTIVATED PIZZA HUT TO GET  OFF THE COUCH AND GET INVOLVED IN OUR POLITICAL PROCESS? WELL, ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY'S  C.M.O., WHICH I HOPE STANDS FOR  CHIEF MOZZARELLA OFFICER, WE  RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SERIOUS ISSUES TO BE DEBATED,  BUT WE ALSO KNOW A LOT LESS  SERIOUS BUT NO-LESS-IMPORTANT  ONES ARE BEING DISCUSSED EVERY NIGHT INSIDE HOUSES ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. TRUE. ISSUES LIKE WHAT THE ( BLEEP )  HAS HAPPENED TO AMERICAN  DEMOCRACY? ( LAUGHTER )  FOLKS, I LOVE THIS. WHAT COULD BE MORE AMERICAN THAN  USING OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS FOR  PRODUCT PLACEMENT? I MEAN, MITT ROMNEY IS ALREADY  SPONSORED BY COKE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  NATION, IT'S NO SECRET THAT  AMERICA'S SCHOOLS ARE FALLING  BEHIND. THEY RANK 31st IN MATH  BEHIND SOUTH KOREA, ESTONIA, AND  LUXEMBOURG, WHICH WOULD REALLY  HURT THEIR FEEL FTION THEY WEREN'T ALSO BEHIND IN  GEOGRAPHY. AND IT IS PARTICULARLY HARD FOR  CHILDREN IN POOR COMMUNITYS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY,  BLACK CHILDREN LIVING IN  DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS FALL  BEHIND THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE YEAR OF SCHOOLING SIMPLY BECAUSE  OF WHERE THEY LIVE. I CAN RELATE. I HAD TO REPEAT SOPHOMORE YEAR  AT DARTMOUTH, JUST BECAUSE I  LIVED IN EAST WHEELOCK WITH MAD  MATTY B., CHOAD EXPAT NACHO  KING. THERE WERE TIMES WE COULD BARELY  AFFORD TO PUT SCHIT ON THE  FOOZ BALL TABLE. OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS LACK THE  RESOURCES TO HELP CHILDREN  SUCCEED. MANY CLASSROOM ALPHABETS ONLY GO  UP TO "R."  A RUE RAGEDY. NATION, IF WE WANT TO HELP POOR  STUDENTS EXCEL, WE NEED TO  INVEST IN MORE TEACHERS, BETTER  RESOURCES, AND NEWER FACILITIES. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE SCREWED. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT THERE MAY BE A WAY TO HELP  UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS REACH THEIR  FULL POTENTIAL WITHOUT WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY TO DO IT, AND IT  BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  MEDUCATION. FOLKS, WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING  TO IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, RACE TO  THE TOP, BUT ONE THING WE'VE  OVERLOOKED IS THE MOST OBVIOUS  ANSWER OF ALL-- WONDER DRUGS. BUT ONE DOCTOR, ONE DOCTOR OUT  THERE IS TRYING. DR. MICHAEL ANDERSON OF CANTON,  GEORGIA, HAS BEGUN PRESCRIBING  KIDS ADDERRAL WHO HAVE NOT BEEN  DIAGNOSED WITH A.D.H.D. HE'S DOING IT JUST TO TREAT  THEIR POOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE  IN INADEQUATE SCHOOLS. SHOCKING. THERE ARE CHILDREN IN AMERICA  WHO HAVEN'T BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH  A.D.H.D. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOW, FOR THOSE, FOR THOSE OUT  THERE WHO SAY THIS IS  PRESCRIBING A POWERFUL DRUG FOR KIDS WHO DO NOT HAVE THE  CONDITION IT TREATS,  DR. ANDERSON HAS A REASSURING  ANSWER. "I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF  CHOICE. WE'VE DECIDE AS A SOCIETY IT'S  TOO EXPENSIVE TO MODIFY THE  KIDS' ENVIRONMENT, SO WE HAVE TO  MODIFY THE KIDS." I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN FAVOR OF  FIXING SOCIETY'S PROBLEMS BY  MODIFYING CHILDREN. ( LAUGHTER )  I MEAN, FOR ONE THING, WE WOULD  NOT HAVE SO MUCH CRIME IF WE  JUST GAVE KIDS LEGAL IMMUNITY AND REPLACED THEIR WARMS PLASMA  CANNONS. THE POINT IS, STUDENTS THRIVE  WHEN THEY GET PERSONAL  ATTENTION, AND SINCE WE CAN'T  AFFORD ALL THE TEACHERS IT WOULD TAKE TO GIVE THEM THAT  ATTENTION, WE'LL GIVE THEM A  PILL THAT HELPS THEM PAY  ATTENTION. I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T PAY  ATTENTION TO HOW LITTLE  ATTENTION WE'RE GIVING THEM. AND DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY, FOLKS. ADDERRAL HELPS KIDS FOCUS. NOT BECAUSE IT'S SOME  AMPHETAMINE. BECAUSE IT'S A COMBINATION OF  FOUR AMPHETAMINES. IT'S LIKE THE COLONEL'S SECRET  RECIPE FOR SPEED  ( LAUGHTER )  FOLKS, I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT  FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE ANSWER, BUT WE CAN DO MORE. I MEAN, WE MIGHT BE CUTTING ARTS  PROGRAMS, BUT ONE TAP OF ACID,  AND YOUR KID WILL BE SEEING  COLORS YOU CAN'T FIND IN A CRAYOLA BOX. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  OF COURSE WITH ANYTHING HAVING  TO DO WITH SCHOOL, THE REAL  PROBLEM STARTS AT HOME. MANY CHILDREN FEEL UNWANTED AND  UNLOVED. BUT ONCE THEY'RE ON ECSTASY,  THEY'LL GET ALL THE NURTURING  THEY COULD EVER WANT JUST BY  NUZZ LING THE DOOR MAT. ( LAUGHTER ). NOW, OF COURSE, EVENTUALLY, IT  MAY TURN OUT THAT DRUGGING POOR  STUDENT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS  THAN IT SOLVES. IN WHICH CASE, WE'LL HAVE TO  STOP TRYING TO CHANGE OUR  CHILDREN AND THINK ABOUT  CHANGING OURSELVES. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )    .   I FEEL BETTER ABOUT FAILING OUR   KIDS ALREADY. THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
