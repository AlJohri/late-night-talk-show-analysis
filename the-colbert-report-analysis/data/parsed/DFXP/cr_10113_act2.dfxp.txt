Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T LIKE TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, AS A CATHOLIC I WAS TAUGHT THAT SELF-TOOTING IS A SIN. BUT TONIGHT I'M COMPELLED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE SOMEONE ELSE'S RECOGNITION OF ME. JIM?
A NEW STUDY SAYS THIS ONE PERSON ON THIS ONE TV SHOW IS ACTUALLY DOING A BETTER JOB EDUCATING YOU THAN OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, WHO IS THAT? ANSWER, "THE COLBERT REPORT." RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE COLBERT NATION NOT ONLY THOUGHT THEY KNEW MORE ABOUT SOMETHING AS WONKY AS CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM THAN OTHERS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. I DID A BETTER JOB INFORMING THE PUBLIC ABOUT CAMPAIGN-FINANCE REFORM THAN EVERY OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATION AND CNN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LONG TIME VIEWERS WILL FONDLY RECALL THE SUPER PAC I SET UP IN 2011, COLBERT SUPER PAC, YOU KNOW OUR MOTTO, MAKING A BETTER TOMORROW-- TOMORROW.
.
Stephen: CLOSE. AND OVER THE COURSE OF TWO YEARS WE REACHED OUR GOAL OF ME COLLECTING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS THAT I WAS FREE TO SPEND IN TOTAL SECRECY. I'VE GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING IN MY THROAT, I'M SORRY. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW THE STUDY SAYS THE KEY TO MY INFORMING YOU WAS SETTING UP MY OWN SUPER PAC BECAUSE YOU GET TO SEE THE PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO A NEWS SOURCE WHERE THEY JUST WOULD TELL YOU THIS IS THE WAY IT IS SO LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU FOX NEWS. SHOW, DON'T TELL. IF YOU WANT YOUR VIEWERS TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR EDITORIAL POSITIONS THEY NEED TO SEE YOU SUCKING TED CRUZ'S BALLS. (LAUGHTER) NATION,-- VERY SALTY, SALTY. A LITTLE-- I'M GUESSING A LITTLE MYSTIQUE. NATION, THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE REPORT. I HAVE BEEN RANKED THE MOST INFORMATIVE OF ALL AMERICAN NEWS ORGANIZATIONS. AND I'M INCREDIBLY SORRY. (LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE WHEN WE BEGAN THIS SHOW I PROMISED TO FEEL THE NEWS AT YOU FROM MY GUT. THAT IS WHY I YANK EVERYTHING I SAY DIRECTLY OUT OF MY ASS BECAUSE IT'S THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN MY GUT AND YOU. I NEVER INTENDED TO BE AN EDUCATOR. WHAT'S NEXT, GETTING PAID LIKE ONE? OH. OH. DOMESTIC AUTOMOBILES. I LET YOU DOWN, NATION. CLEARLY I MUST WORK HARDER AT INFORMING YOU LESS. AND TO DO THAT I HUMBLY BOW MYSELF BEFORE THE MASTERS.
COMING UP NEXT ON NEW DAY, ARE YOU READY? FOR A PRINCE SELFIE?
WHAT VIDEOS DID YOU FORWARD TO YOUR FRIENDS THIS YEAR?
THE BABY SQUIRREL IN A CAST. NEED WE SAY ANY MORE?
WE'RE GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE WORLD'S FIRST BURRITO VENDING MACHINE.
COMING UP NEXT RIGHT HERE WHAT YOUR DOG COULD BE DOING WHEN YOU'RE NOT HOME. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WOW. THE BAR OF LOWNESS HAS BEEN SET VERY HIGH. BUT I THINK I GOT IT. WHEN WE RETURN I WILL SPEND SIX MINUTES READING QUESTIONS OFF A CARD TO 22 JUMP STREET STAR JONAH HILL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
