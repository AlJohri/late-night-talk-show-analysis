Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! FOLKS, IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING THE SHOW, BACK IN THE A BLOCK, I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNET. I LOVE IT. (LAUGHTER) NEVER IN HUMAN HISTORY HAVE WE HAD ACCESS TO SUCH A VAST COMPENDIUM OF KNOWLEDGE TO IGNORE WHILE WE CRITICIZE PHOTOS OF BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN. NICE CAT EARS, YA DOUCHE-BAT. BUT THE INTERNET ALSO HAS A DARK SIDE. IT REMEMBERS EVERY SHAMEFUL THING YOU'VE EVER DONE AND THAT HAS HURT A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE, ALSO ANTHONY WEINER. EVEN I AM NOT IMMUNE. I RECENTLY GOOGLED MYSELF AND FOUND SOME VERY DISTURBING OLD PHOTOS. I MEAN, WHAT IF MY CHILDREN STUMBLE ACROSS THAT AND FIND OUT I USED TO BE A CHILD! MY CHILDREN WOULD LOSE ALL RESPECT FOR ME! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME CLEAN MY ROOM, YOU'RE JUST SOME OLD KID! (LAUGHTER) LUCKILY, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS PIONEERED THE ANSWER.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN. THAT'S WHAT THE E.U. COURT TOLD GOOGLE.
EUROPEAN COURTS NOW REQUIRING GOOGLE TO REMOVE CERTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM THE WEB ABOUT CUSTOMERS.
INDIVIDUALS CAN ASK THE SEARCH GIANT TO REMOVE LINKS TO NEWS ARTICLES AND COURT JUDGMENTS AMONG OTHER THINGS. IT'S BEEN DUBBED THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN.
Stephen: YES, THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN, FIRST PROPOSED BY -- OH, WHAT'S HIS NAME? ANYWAY, I WANT TO CONGRATULATE EUROPE FOR TAKING THIS BOLD STEP. IT'S NO WONDER THEY DID. I DID A LITTLE GOOGLING THIS AFTERNOON. I COULD SEE WHY EUROPE WOULD WANT TO HIDE THEIR PAST. I MEAN, THE INQUISITION AND THE BAND THAT DID BARBIE GIRL? THE HAGUE HAS GOT THEIR HANDS FULL. NOW ANYONE IN EUROPE CAN ASK GOOGLE TO REMOVE LINKS AND BE ABLE TO GET A CLEAN SLATE -- POLITICIANS, YOUR BABY SITTER, THAT NICE YOUNG MAN WHO HAS TO GO DOOR TO DOOR TELLING NEIGHBORS THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM HE HAD  ERASED FROM THE INTERNET. NOW THE E.U. COURT ISN'T SAYING WE SHOULD ERASE ALL RECORDS OF THE PAST. THEY'RE JUST SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GOOGLE IT, BECAUSE WITHOUT A SEARCH ENGINE, INCRIMINATING INFORMATION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN INTERCONNECTED OR COULD HAVE BEEN BUT ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY. YES, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT HARDER TO FIND INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET. AND YAHOO ANSWERS CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. IF ONLY THERE WERE A WAY TO STORE KNOWLEDGE IN A PLACE  WHERE IT EXISTS BUT NO ONE WILL SEE OR HEAR OF IT. PERHAPS WE COULD PRINT IT OCCASIONALLY THEN BIND IT AND HOUSE IT IN A BUILDING YOU NEED A SPECIAL CARD TO ACCESS. YEAH! YEAH! NOW, THAT'S THE FUTURE.
