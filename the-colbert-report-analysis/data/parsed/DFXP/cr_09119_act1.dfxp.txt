TONIGHT, POLITICAL UNREST IN SOUTH AMERICA. OR THEY'RE HAPPY. I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH. THEN CONTROVERSY IN A FLORIDA COURTROOM. APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T SUE YOUR GRAND KIDS FOR NOT CALLING. AND MY GUEST TUFTS HISTORY PROFESSOR PENIEL JOSEPH WILL DISCUSS CONTROVERSIAL CHANGES TO THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. I HOPE IT DOESN'T AFFECT "SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE." ITALY'S SILVIO BURLUSCONI WAS CONVICTED OF PAYING FOR SEX WITH AN UNDERAGED PROSTITUTE WHICH MEANS IT COULD BE MONTHS BEFORE HE'S RE-ELECTED PRIME MINISTER. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.  Captioning sponsored by  COMEDY CENTRAL (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  THEME SONG PLAYING  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: HELLO, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. NATION, THANK YOU. I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT 'EM. I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT 'EM. I'M BUT ONE MAN. THANK YOU, FOLKS. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I COULD NOT DO THIS SHOW WITHOUT YOU. I AM BUT ONE MAN. YOU ARE THE NATION. AND FOLKS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW YOU KNOW I BELIEVE IN AMERICA'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WHENEVER ANYBODY ASKS I SAY, "OUR COURTS ARE THE BEST." UNLESS THEY'RE ASKING ME TO SERVE JURY DUTY IN WHICH CASE I SAY, "HITLER HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS." THAT USUALLY GETS ME SENT HOME   MACH SCHNELL  . SO I'VE BEEN PAYING PRETTY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SUPREME COURT WHICH JUST TODAY OVERTURNED A KEY PROVISION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 WHICH REQUIRED THE JIM CROW STATES TO GET FEDERAL PERMISSION BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF THEIR VOTING LAWS. THANKFULLY, CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, OLD BLUE EYES, KNOWS THAT THE SOUTH DOESN'T NEED TO BE BABYSAT ANYMORE SAYING, QUOTE, NEARLY 50 YEARS LATER THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. YES, FOR SOME REASON SINCE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS PASSED, THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. THEREFORE, WE CAN GET RID OF IT NOW. IT'S JUST LIKE THOSE OUTDATED LABOR LAWS THAT PROHIBIT CHILDREN FROM THREADING BOBBINS ON A LOOM. A KID HASN'T BEEN SUCKED INTO ONE OF THOSE MACHINES IN YEARS. LET'S STOP PLAYING NANNY HERE. I'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS IMPORTANT DECISION LATER IN THE SHOW WITH MY GUEST PROFESSOR PENIEL JOSEPH. I HEAR HE'S BLACK. NATION, I DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO SOUTH AMERICA ANY MORE THAN I CARE ABOUT EAST AMERICA OR WEST AMERICA OR UPSIDE-DOWN AMERICA. BUT EVEN I CANNOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT BRAZIL IS GOING THROUGH A MAJOR POLITICAL UPHEAVAL, OR AS THEY CALL IT,   FUTBOL  . JIM?
NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE SPILLED INTO THE STREETS IN MAJOR CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE BIGGEST PROTEST BRAZIL HAS SEEN IN DECADES. PROTESTORS WENT HEAD TO HEAD WITH RIOT POLICE AND WERE MET WITH TEAR GAS.
MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE HITTING THE STREETS IN AT LEAST 80 CITIES.
Stephen: FOLKS, I DON'T GET IT. THIS IS BRAZIL, THE MOST JOYFUL PLACE ON EARTH. THE ONLY THING BRAZILIANS EVER GET MAD AT IS THEIR PUBIC HAIR. I DON'T... I HAVE NEVER HEARD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DID TO THEM BUT THEY ARE MERCILESS DOWN THERE. NO PRISONERS. SO JUST WHAT IS IT THAT UPSET THEM? DID PELE PUT ONE OF THOSE CARMEN MIRANDA HATS ON THE GIANT STATUE OF JESUS? BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT BRAZIL. JIM? ANYTHING ELSE?
THE BIGGER ANGER BEHIND THIS MOVEMENT IS A SENSE THAT THIS NATION IS TRYING TO SHOW ITSELF ON THE WORLD STAGE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON STADIUMS AHEAD OF THE OLYMPICS AND ORDINARY PEOPLE FEELING THEY'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH ATTENTION FROM THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.
THEY'RE ANGRY OVER THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT ON THE 2014 WORLD CUP.
Stephen: NATION, STAND WITH THE PEOPLE OF BRAZIL BECAUSE I TOO THINK SOCCER IS A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. A BILLION DOLLAR STADIUM FOR A GAME THAT CAN END ZERO-ZERO? I MEAN, GOD DAMN IT. JUST USE YOUR HANDS. THEY'RE SUPER HELPFUL. I MEAN, LOOK... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. LOOK, HEY, LOOK, GUESS WHAT. I DIDN'T DIE. GOOOOAL! FOR MORE ON THIS SITUATION WAY SOUTH OF THE BORDER, JOINING ME NOW IS MY LATIN AMERICAN COLLEAGUE, ESTEBAN COLBERTO.
Esteban: HOLA, STEPHEN, Y BIENVENIDOS A COLBERTO REPORTO GIGANTE!
Stephen ESTEBAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
Esteban: CHICAS, CHICAS!   BUSINESS  .
Stephen: WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL?
Esteban: [no audio]
Stephen: NOTHING?
Esteban: NADA.
Stephen: NOTHING? >>Esteban: SOY MEXICANO. ELLOS SON BRASILEROS. ES COMO COMPARAR MANZANAS, Y NARANJAS CALVAS, LOCAS POR EL SEXO.
Stephen: COME ON. IT'S ALL THE SAME LATINO CULTURE DOWN THERE.
Esteban: NO, NO, NO. EN MEXICO, HABLAMOS EL HERMOSO IDIOMA ESPANOL. EN BRAZIL, HABLAN PORTUGUES, QUE SUENA COMO UNA GAITA VIOLANDO UN PERRO.
Stephen SO DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHY THE BRAZILIANS ARE RIOTING?
Esteban SUPONGO, ES PORQUE PELE LE PUSO UNO DE ESOS SOMBREROS DE CARMEN MIRANDA A LA ESTATUA GIGANTE DE JESUS.
Stephen: SO, YOU'RE NO HELP.
Esteban: ES UN PLACER. ï¿½CHICAS!
Stephen: ESTEBAN COLBERTO, EVERYBODY, FROM THE COLBERTO REPORTO GIGANTE! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT, JIMMY, THAT'S ENOUGH. JIMMY, CUT THE FEED. JIMMY, THAT'S ENOUGH. WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW HE COULD MOVE THAT WELL. WELL, FOLKS, IF ESTEBAN CAN'T HELP US UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL, I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO SETTLE FOR AN EXPERT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL. PLEASE WELCOME THE FORMER BRAZIL BUREAU CHIEF FROM THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND AUTHOR OF "BRAZIL ON THE RISE," LARRY ROHTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. ROHTER. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S THE BOOK. HERE YOU GO. BRAZIL ON THE RISE. OKAY. SIR, HOW DID THIS START? OKAY? YOU'VE GOT RIOTS IN THE STREET. YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE,  MILLIONS ON SOME DAYS. WHAT IS IT? DID THEY GET UPSET BY CORRUPTION? WAS THERE A KILLING? DID THEY GIVE ALL THE AMAZON AWAY TO MacDONALD'S FOR BEEF? WHAT STARTED IT?
CORRUPTION. AS YOU MENTIONED, THE MONEY BEING SPENT ON THE WORLD CUP AND THE OLYMPICS. THE FEELING THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO INTO THE HANDS OF, YOU KNOW, POLITICIANS AND, YOU KNOW, BUSINESSMEN TAKING A CUT. CONCERNS THAT THE MONEY THAT'S GOING THERE IS MONEY BETTER SPENT ON HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, PUBLIC SECURITY.
Stephen: SO THEY'RE ASKING FOR GOVERNMENT HANDOUTS? OKAY. WAH WAH WAH. GIMME, GIMME, GIMME. WELCOME TO OBAMA'S LATIN AMERICA. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
NOT EXACTLY.
OKAY, SO WHAT WAS THE TRIGGERING POINT? WHAT STARTED THIS.
THE TRIGGER WAS SOMETHING PRETTY INNOCUOUS REALLY, A TEN-CENT INCREASE IN BUS FARES.
Stephen: WHAT? A TEN-CENT INCREASE IN BUS FARES.
Stephen: PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS FOR A TEN-CENT INCREASE IN BUS FARE? HOW GOOD ARE THESE BUSES? WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING TOO TRY TO CALM THIS DOWN? ARE THEY SAYING WE'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING OR ARE THEY SAYING PULL YOURSELVES UP BY YOUR OWN BOOTSTRAPS, IF THEY EVER WORE BOOTS OR PANTS THERE?
THIS IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ARAB SPRING OR CHINA BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT'S TRYING IN ESSENCE TO COOPT THIS MOVEMENT. THEY ARE SAYING ROLL BACK THE BUS FARE INCREASE.
Stephen: REALLY? THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS, WE'LL GIVE YOU YOUR TEN CENTS BACK.
OKAY. AND TODAY THE PRESIDENT SAYING, WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A PLEBISCITE TO DETERMINE WHAT KINDS OF CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WE SHOULD MAKE. YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO BRING THE PEOPLE INTO THE PROCESS MORE.
Stephen: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS? ARE THESE JUST POOR PEOPLE IN THE STREETS?
NO. THE THING ABOUT BRAZIL IS THAT IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE COUNTRY HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY SO THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE ZOOMED PAST ITALY, RUSSIA, INDIA, EVEN GREAT BRITAIN, AND THEY'RE ZEROING IN ON FRANCE. THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER PLACES, A LOT OF THAT WEALTH IS NOW BEING DISTRIBUTED AMONG PEOPLE WHO WERE FORMERLY POOR BUT, YOU KNOW, 50 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE MOVED INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS. >>SO, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RIOTING. DO YOU THINK WE DON'T HAVE RIOTS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS? PROBABLY THE SAFEST THING TO DO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. LARRY ROHTER, "BRAZIL ON THE RISE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
