READY TO GO  READY TO GO   Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT."  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN HERE OUT THERE. I'M SURE YOU CAN TELL BY THAT  CHANTING THIS CROWD HAS GOTTEN C  OSHSLBMENTUM. (LAUGHTER)  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LAST NIGHT  WAS THE THIRD AND FINAL  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. IT THREW MUCH-NEED ATTENTION TO  TWO KEY DOMESTIC ISSUES, "MONDAY  NIGHT FOOTBALL" AND THE NATIONAL  LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP. (LAUGHTER)  AS YOU REMEMBER, FOLKS, THE  FIRST DEBATE WAS A BLOWOUT WIN  FOR ROMNEY. THE SECOND DEBATE-- ALSO  HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER)  SO LET'S GET THE TRUTH OF NIGHT  THREE IN "STEPHEN COLBERT'S  DEBATE 2012 COVERAGE."  TWO MEN, ONE WHEEL. WHO GETS TO DRIVE US OVER THE  CLIFF? (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THESE PEOPLE ARE HUGE FANS OF  BUICK. (LAUGHTER)  I WAS SO EXCITED BECAUSE LAST  NIGHT WAS OFFICIALLY THE FOREIGN  POLICY DEBATE. UNFORTUNATELY-- AND I DO NOT  KNOW THIS-- THAT MEANS YOU HAVE  TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER  STUPID COUNTRIES. (LAUGHTER)  AND THIS BEING BOCA RATON,  FLORIDA, THEY HIT ALL THE  IMPORTANT ONES.
ISRAEL IS A TRUE FRIEND, IT  IS OUR GREATEST ALLY IN THE  REGION.
ISRAEL. OUR CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE  REGION.
THEY HAVE TO ABIDE BY THEIR  TREATY WITH ISRAEL.
OUR ALLY ISRAEL.
OUR BOND W ISRAEL.
ISRAEL.
ISRAEL.
ISRAEL.
ISRAEL.
ISRAEL.
ISRAEL. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I WAS PLAYING A  DRINKING GAME LAST NIGHT WHERE I  TOOK A SHOT OF MANISCHEWITZ  EVERY TIME -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  EVERY TIME SOMEONE SAID "ISRAEL"  AND BY THE END OF THE DEBATE I  WAS TOTALLY DIABETIC. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, FOLKS, THIS WASN'T JUST  ABOUT ISRAEL IT WAS ALSO ABOUT  COUNTRIES THAT POSE A THREAT TO  ISRAEL. A THREAT THAT OBAMA HAS DONE  NOTHING TO STOP.
WE'RE FOUR YEARS CLOSER TO A  NUCLEAR IRAN. WE'RE FOUR YEARS CLOSER TO A  NUCLEAR IRAN.
YES. FOUR YEARS AFTER OBAMA WAS  ELECTED, FOUR WHOLE YEARS HAVE  PASSED. (LAUGHTER)  THE PRESIDENT DID NOTHING TO  STOP THE MARCH OF TIME  (LAUGHTER)  NOT ONLY IS IRAN FOUR YEARS CLOSER TO A NUCLEAR BOMB, IF YOU  THINK ABOUT IT, EVERYBODY IS. EVEN ME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ADMITTEDLY, I'M STILL FAR AWAY. THE MENTOS AND DIET COKE STAGE. BUT STILL. (LAUGHTER)  AND, FOLKS, MITT LAID OUT HIS  PROSECUTION OF THE PRESIDENT'S  WEAK LEADERSHIP.
FOUR YEARS AGO THE PRESIDENT  BEGAN WHAT I CALLED AN APOLOGY  TOUR OF GOING TO VARIOUS NATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND  CRITICIZING AMERICA. I THINK THEY LOOK AT THAT AND  SAW WEAKNESS.
NOTHING GOVERNOR ROMNEY JUST  SAID IS TRUE.
YES IT IS! (LAUGHTER)  YOU APOLOGIZED. NOT ONLY THAT, YOU BOWED TO  LEADERS ALL OVER THE WORLD! THAT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL! F.D.R. NEVER BOWED TO FOREIGN  LEADERS. (LAUGHTER)  HE NEVER EVEN STOOD FOR THEM! (LAUGHTER)  BUT OBAMA --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  -- OBAMA, OBAMA WILL BOW TO  ANYONE! HELL, AFTER THE DEBATE HE BOWED  TO ROMNEY'S GRANDSON! (LAUGHTER)  AND, FOLKS, GREAT POINTS BY  ROMNEY BUT IT'S NOT JUST WHAT  ROMNEY SAID IT'S THE WAY HE  DIDN'T SAY IT.
THE PRESIDENT HAD A VERY  INTENT LOOK ON HIS FACE. I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT AS A MEAN  LOOK, I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS A  MAN LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO  STRIKE.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY, IT SEEMED TO  ME, HAD THIS KIND OF BENIGN  DEFAULT EXPRESSION IN WHICH HE  APPEARS TO BE INTERESTED MOST OF THE TIME, HE HAS A SLIGHT SMILE  ON HIS FACE BUT NOT A SMUG ONE. I WONDER IF HI HIS WAS NOT THE  MORE ATTRACTIVE DEFAULT  EXPRESSION. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES! ROMNEY'S FACE TOTALLY KICKED  OBAMA'S FACE'S ASS. (LAUGHTER)  JIMMY, PUT UP ROMNEY'S DEFAULT  EXPRESSION. SEE? SEE? THAT'S NICE. THAT REMINDS ME OF A BENEVOLENT  ANGEL WATCHING ME SHOWER. (LAUGHTER)  HI! (LAUGHTER)  THAT GUY CAN WATCH ME ALL DAY. AND, OF COURSE, OF COURSE, OF  COURSE MITT WAS SMILING! BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE NAILED IT.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY DID DO WHAT  HE NEEDED TO DO WHICH WAS TO  PRESENT HIMSELF AS A VERY  PLAUSIBLE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
MITT ROMNEY HAD A JOB TONIGHT  AND THAT WAS TO COME ACROSS AS A  PLAUSIBLE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
ROMNEY SIMPLY NEEDING TO SHOW  THAT, YOU KNOW, HE'S A PLAUSIBLE  PRESIDENT.
AND HE ACHIEVED PLAUSIBLE. (LAUGHTER)  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LOOKED AT  MITT ROMNEY LAST NIGHT AND SAID  "HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD SIT IN AN OVAL ROOM."  (LAUGHTER)  PLAUSIBILITY IS A HUGE VICTORY  FOR ROMNEY BECAUSE THIS RACE IS  NECK AND NECK.
WE'VE SEEN THIS LATEST POLL  OUT OF THE NBC AND "WALL STREET  JOURNAL."  47/47, PRETTY MUCH CORRESPONDS WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING OUT  THERE. AN ABSOLUTE DEAD HEAT.
Stephen: AS WE KNOW FROM  HISTORY, THE RULES CLEARLY  DICTATE THAT IN THE EVENT OF A  TIE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE GEORGE W. BUSH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE MISS YOU, SIR. WE MISS YOU. BUT AT THIS POINT, EITHER  CANDIDATE STILL HAS A SHOT AS  LONG AS THEY CAN WIN OVER ONE  KEY DEMOGRAPHIC.
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND GOVERNOR  ROMNEY FACED OFF. MANY POLLS SHOWING THEM RUNNING  NECK IN NECK, MAKING THE  REMAINING UNDECIDED VOTERS MORE  IMPORTANT THAN EVER.
THE UNDECIDED VOTERS. THE VOTERS IN THE SWING STATES  WHO COULD DECIDE THIS ELECTION.
MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA  YEARN FOR THEIR VOTE, THE  ELUSIVE MYSTERIOUS UNDECIDED  VOTER. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES, THEY YEARN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YES. ELUSIVE, MYSTERIOUS UNDECIDED  VOTERS. I WONDER WHAT HE'S THINKING. (LAUGHTER)  OR IF. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, FOLKS, HERE'S HOW IT  STANDS. THE ELECTORAL KITCHEN IS CLOSING  IN TWO WEEKS AND THEY STILL  CAN'T DECIDE IF THEY WANT THE  BLACK-AND-WHITE COOKIE OR THE DECAF WHEAT THIN. (LAUGHTER)  THEY'RE ELUSIVE! BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE OUT  THERE! THESE CAMPAIGNS HAVE SPENT  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO  CAPTURE THEM WITH LAWN SIGNS,  T.V. ADS, RADIO SPOTS, INTERNET BANNERS, ROBOCALLS AND, FOR SOME  LUCKY OHIO VOTERS, AN AMOROUS  DAVID AXELROD WITH A ROSE IN HIS  TEETH. (LAUGHTER)  BUT A FEW AND THE LIESING FACTS  ABOUT THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES  HAVE EMERGED.
UNDECIDED VOTER THEY SAY  TYPICALLY A SINGLE WHITE FEMALE  BETWEEN 18 AND 29 YEARS OLD, SHE  HAS A JOB WITH A LOW INCOME, SHE DID NOT GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE. ACCORDING TO THIS POLL SHE  SKIPPED WATCHING THE DEBATE.
Stephen: FASCINATING. THE PERSON WHO WILL DECIDE THIS  RACE IS A LIKELY VOTER WHO IS A  YOUNG WOMAN WITH LOW INCOME AND  LOW EDUCATION WHO IS ALSO ISOLATED FROM ANY NEWS. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  TONIGHT I HAVE FOUND ONE SUCH  VOTER. FROM THE SWING STATE OF NORTH  CAROLINA, UNDECIDED VOTER NELL. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME, NELL. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW, NELL, NELL, YOU ARE A FERAL  BACK-WOODS WOMAN WHO KNOWS  NOTHING OF EITHER OF THESE  CANDIDATES OR, FOR THAT MATTER, HUMAN SOCIETY. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH WAY ARE YOU LEANING NOW?
ROM-A-NAY. MITT ROM-A-NAY!
Stephen: OKAY, SO YOU'RE  LEANING ROMNEY AT THIS POINT. WHAT IT IS ABOUT ROMNEY'S  MESSAGE THAT-- AND, AGAIN, YOU  KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM-- THAT  APPEALS TO YOU. OBARMA. BARACKA OBARMA.
Stephen: I'M SORRY, DID YOU  SAY OBAMA? ARE YOU READY TO DO FOR MORE  YEARS?
I'M LIKE-A-LAY. LIKE-A-LAY.
Stephen: I'M AWARE OF THAT. YOU ARE A LIKELY VOTER. WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT MUCH. BUT WHICH CANDIDATE ARE YOU  LIKE-A-LAY TO VOTE FOR? (LAUGHTER)
SANTOR-UM.
Stephen: RICK SANTORUM IS NOT  IN THE RACE ANY MORE! JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND! COME ON! IS IT ROMNEY OR OBAMA?
ROM-BAMA-NEY ROM-BAMA-NEY.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
