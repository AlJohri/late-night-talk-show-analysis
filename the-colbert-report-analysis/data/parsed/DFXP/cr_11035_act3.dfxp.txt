Stephen: MY GUEST IS A PEABODY AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST AND HOST OF THE TRUE CRIME PODCAST "SERIAL." I CAN'T BELIEVE CAP'N CRUNCH MURDERED A GUY. PLEASE WELCOME SARAH KOENIG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MISS KOENIG, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AS YOU CAN SEE, YOU ARE THE WORLD'S FIRST SUPERSTAR PODCASTER. LET'S GET INTO HOW THIS CAME ABOUT. YOU'RE A PEABODY AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST. YOU WORK FOR THE "BALTIMORE SUN" ABC NEWS, "NEW YORK TIMES," SPENT PAST 10 YEARS AS PRODUCER AT "THIS AMERICAN LIFE." NOW YOU'RE HOSTING THE FIRST SPIN-OFF PODCAST "SERIAL," AND THE PENULTIMATE EPISODE IS AVAILABLE TOMORROW, THURSDAY, AND YOUR LAST ONE IS THE SAME AS MY LAST SHOW, DECEMBER 18. THAT MEANS WE'RE WE'RE COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER.
I KNOW. I'M AWARE
Stephen: YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT?
YEAH.
Stephen: OK IT'S GO TIME. HOW DOES IT FEEL AS A JOURNALIST, DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO DO TRUE CRIME REPORTING THAT PEOPLE LISTEN TO ON A TREADMILL? ( LAUGHTER ).   ( CHEERS ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT FIRST INSPIRED YOU TO DO A SPIN-OFF PODCAST? WHAT FIRST DREW YOU TO DOING THIS MEDIUM, FIRST OF ALL?
I THINK-- YOU KNOW, I'D BEEN WORKING AT THE RADIO SHOW FOR A LONG TIME AND A FELLOW PRODUCER, JULIE SNYDER, AND I SORT OF WERE THINKING WHAT ELSE DO WE WANT TO DO? WE COULD TRY THIS LITTLE THING AND I COULD BE IN MY BASEMENT WITH A MICROPHONE --
Stephen: BUT WHY MURDER. YOU'RE COMING FROM "THIS AMERICAN LIFE." IT SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST SPIN-OFF PODCAST WOULD BE SIBLINGS WHO THOUGHT THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE IMAGINARY FRIENDS. OR 24 HOURS IN A CHIROPRACTIC WAITING ROOM. WHY MURDER?
IT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY THAT WE WANTED TO DO A SHOW ABOUT MURDER. WE WANTED TO BE A SERIALIZED DOCUMENTARY. AND THIS HAPPENED TO BE A STORY THAT I WAS ALREADY INTERESTED IN, THAT I WAS ALREADY-- HAD JUST STARTED WORKING ON WHEN WE GOT THE IDEA TO DO "SERIAL"." I SAID I'VE GOT A STORY. LET'S DO THIS ONE. IT SEEMED TO HAVE A LOT GOING ON AND SEEMED ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN IT OVER TIME.
Stephen: "SERIAL" GOT FIVE MILLION iTUNES DOWNLOADS, FASTER THAN ANY OTHER PODCAST IN HISTORY. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE THE MOST POPULAR PODCAST IN HISTORY? DO YOU GET PAID IN iTUNES GIFT CARDS. I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW THE MONEY HERE. WHAT BENEFITS YOU DOING THIS?
WELL, I'M HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED TO SAY. YOU'RE MY FAVORITE GUEST OF ALL TIME NOW. THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THE ACTUAL CASE ITSELF.
YEAH.
Stephen: IT TAKES PLACE IN BALTIMORE, THE SAME FICTIONAL CITY FROM "THE WIRE." WITHOUT GIVING REQUEST SPOILERS AWAY, CAN YOU GIVE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HEARD SERIAL A LITTLE NUTSHELL OF WHAT THE CASE IS.
IT'S THE MURDER OF AN 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL. SHE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN BALTIMORE COUNTY AND SHE WENT MISSING ONE DAY AFTER SCHOOL, AND NOBODY KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, AND THEN HER BODY TURNED UP ABOUT A MONTH LATER IN A CITY PARK. SHE HAD BEEN BURIED. AND A FEW WEEKS LATER, HER EX-BOYFRIEND, A 17-YEAR-OLD KID, A FELLOW SENIOR AT THE HIGH SCHOOL, ADNAN SYED, WAS ARRESTED. AND --
Stephen:  WHY REOPEN THIS CASE? YOU GUYS WEEK TO WEEK GO INTO A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF THE CASE, WHY GO BACK INTO HIS STORY? THIS HAPPENED IN 1999. DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT A GUY NAMED ADNAD SYAD COULD GET A FAIRER TRIAL AFTER 9/11? IS THERE A GOAL? ARE YOU AN ADVOCATE JOURNALIST? ARE YOU TRYING TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS GUY?
I AM NOT ADVOCATING FOR THIS GUY. WHAT GRABBED ME ABOUT THIS STORY IS A FRIEND OF HIS FAMILY CAME TO ME AND SAID, I BELIEVE THIS GUY IS INNOCENT. THE TRIAL WAS CRAZY. THE INVESTIGATION HAS HOLES IN IT. I BELIEVE THIS GUY'S INNOCENT. CAN YOU TAKE A LOOK? SO I STARTED LOOKING INTO IT, AND I JUST BECAME SO CONFUSED SO QUICKLY. SO I JUST KEPT GOING FROM THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS IS THAT FROM WEEK TO WEEK YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR OPINION ABOUT WHO YOU THINK DID THIS OR WHAT THE TRUTH MIGHT BE OF THE SITUATION. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SHOW FOR NINE YEARS, AND I HAVE NEVER ONCE CHANGED MY OPINION ABOUT ANYTHING, OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S COMMITMENT. THAT'S COMMITMENT TO MY IDEALS, OKAY?
I KNOW. IT'S TRUE. WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE A STORY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, IT'S TRUE. I LACK COMMITMENT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BUT WITHOUT GIVING ANY SPOILERS AWAY, CAN YOU JUST TELL ME IF BY THE END OF THE SERIES, THAT GIRL EVER LEARNS TO PRONOUNCE "MALE CHIMP?"
YOU KNOW, WE STILL-- WE STILL HAVE A WEEK TO GO. I AM STILL REPORTING. I AM STILL REPORTING AND THINGS COULD CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN SO NEXT WEEK IS WHEN YOU'LL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
Stephen: I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SARAH KOENIG, "SERIAL." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
