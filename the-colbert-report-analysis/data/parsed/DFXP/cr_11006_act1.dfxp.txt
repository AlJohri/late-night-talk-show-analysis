(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
STEPHEN: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US! PLEASE, SIT DOWN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR BEING HERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. A LOT TO GET DONE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING THIS SHOW ON A MEMORY CUBE, THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN THE FUTURE, I WANT TO OFFER YOU A HARDY BLEEP BLORP FOR JOINING US. (LAUGHTER) FOR THOSE OF YOU SHARING THE PRESENT CHRONOSPHERE, IT'S DAY SEVEN OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT SOME ARE CALL "EBOLAPALOOZA." (LAUGHTER) NOT MANY. JUST ME SO FAR. BUT IT'S GOING TO CATCH ON. YOU CAN SMELL THE FEAR, THANKS TO HEROES LIKE CNN WHO ASKED THE QUESTION, "EBOLA:  THE I.S.I.S. OF BIOLOGICAL AGENTS?" YES, IT IS. WITHOUT A DOUBT. SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG COMPARED DISEASES TO MURDEROUS MADMEN. THAT'S WHY EPIDEMIOLOGISTS CALL TUBERCULOSIS LUNG HITLER. (LAUGHTER) ONE PERSON WHO IS IRRESPONSIBLY CALM IS PRESIDENT BARACK EBOLA. JUST LISTEN TO HOW THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO WARD OFF THE RAGE VIRUS.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING NEW ACTION TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF EBOLA. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID MONDAY THAT AIRLINE PASSENGERS TRAVELING FROM THE EBOLA HOT ZONE WILL SOON UNDERGO ADDITIONAL SCREENING AT BOTH ENDS OF THEIR JOURNEYS.
STEPHEN: WELL, I'M GLAD THEY'RE CHECKING AT BOTH ENDS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE EBOLA SQUIRTS OUT. (LAUGHTER) BUT I'M SORRY... (APPLAUSE) BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR BODILY FLUIDS TONIGHT! THIS IS A HOT CROWD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY'RE NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY ENOUGH. THE LATEST POLLS SHOW ONLY 11% OF AMERICANS ARE "VERY WORRIED" ABOUT BEING INFECTED BY EBOLA. AND IT'S NOT MY FAULT BECAUSE I'VE DONE MY PART TO MAKE YOU SHART. AND I WANNA KNOW HOW I'M DOING. GO TO COLBERTNATION.COM TONIGHT AND TAKE MY POLL: THE COLBERT WORRIED POLL -- HOW WORRIED ARE YOU ABOUT THE UNSTOPPABLE VIRUS THAT'S JUST SECONDS AWAY FROM INFECTING EVERYONE YOU LOVE? SOMEWHAT? VERY? OR HAZMAT BUBBLE PREVENTS ME FROM CLICKING ON ANSWER? (LAUGHTER) WE'LL CALCULATE THE RESULTS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TOMORROW FOR THE GANGS OF FERAL BANDITS SEARCHING THROUGH CHARRED WAL-MARTS FOR CLUES AS TO WHAT ENDED HUMANITY. MM-MM-MM. OH HI, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ENJOY A BIG MAC HAMBURGER SANDWICH FROM AMERICA'S FAVORITE HAMBURGER SANDWICH RESTAURANT, MCDONALD'S. THE FAST FOOD CHAIN WAS FOUNDED IN 1955 BY RAY KROC. WHO BECAME SO RICH AND FAMOUS THAT HE HAD TO SPEND  THE REST OF HIS LIFE HIDING IN A PURPLE SUIT. (LAUGHTER) AND RAY KROC'S VERY "FIRST" MCDONALD'S WAS LOCATED IN DES PLAINES, WHICH IS IN THE SUBJECT OF THE 80TH INSTALLMENT OF MY 434-PART SERIES, "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT. "TONIGHT, ILLINOIS 8TH. THE FIGHTIN' 8TH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE 8TH IS HOME TO THE WORLD HEADQUARTERS OF MOTOROLA. IN 1983, THEY RELEASED THE WORLD'S FIRST CONSUMER CELLULAR PHONE, THE DYNA-TAC , WHICH QUICKLY BECAME MORE POPULAR THAN THE PHONE BOOTH, DESPITE BEING SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN ONE. (LAUGHTER) THE 8TH IS ALSO HOME TO NOT ONE BY TWO IKEAS. THE SCHAUMBURG IKEA AND THE BOLLINGBROOK IKEA. THEY WERE ONLY GOING TO BUILD ONE IKEA, BUT AFTER THEY FINISHED THE FIRST ONE, THEY HAD ENOUGH PARTS LEFT OVER TO BUILD A SECOND. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FAMOUS RESIDENTS OF THE 8TH INCLUDE HAROLD GRAY, CARTOONIST AND CREATOR OF THE COMIC STRIP "LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE." THE STORY OF A RED-HEADED SCAMP WHO WAS SO POOR SHE HAD TO SELL HER PUPILS FOR FOOD. AND WHO HAS THE MCNUGGETS TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT? IT'S NONE OTHER THAN CONGRESSWOMAN TAMMY DUCKWORTH. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE DUCKWORTH IN HER WASHINGTON OFFICE. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME TODAY.
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, STEPHEN.
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WEARING  YOUR MAD MAX THUNDERDOME JACKET.
DO YOU LIKE IT?
STEPHEN: I DO. YOU WERE BORN IN BANGKOK. SO TO BE CLEAR,  ARE YOU AN AMERICAN, CONGRESSWOMAN?
MY FATHER SERVED IN VIETNAM AND MET AND MARRIED MY MOTHER.
STEPHEN: THE TAIWANESE PEOPLE MUST BE PROUD OF YOU.
THAT WOULD BE THAI.  TAIWANESE ARE FROM TAIWAN.
STEPHEN: POTATO, POTAHATO. MOVING ON, YOU SPONSORED H.R. 15 WHICH WOULD INCREASE BORDER SECURITY.  SO WE AGREE ON HOW TO SECURE THE BORDERS, HOW WOULD YOU DO SO?
I THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF SECURING THE BORDERS NOW
STEPHEN: DO YOU BELIEVE IN A WALL?
IF THE WALL MAKES SOMEBODY HAPPY AND IT'S NOT -- THEN FINE. BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM --
STEPHEN: BY COMPREHENSIVE  DO YOU MEAN MORE THAN A WALL? BECAUSE MY PLAN IS MORE THAN A WALL. I SAY WALL, MOAT, FILLED WITH FLAMES, FIREPROOF ALLIGATORS. YOU KNOW THESE MIGRANT CHILDREN ARE DISEASE VECTORS. YOU'VE READ THE REPORTS AND I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE REPORTS ON TELEVISION THAT THEY'RE BRINGING EBOLA INTO THE UNITED STATES.
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
STEPHEN: I THINK I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT IT ALREADY BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT THESE KIDS ON THE BORDER I GET A VERY WEIRD CLUTCHING FEELING IN MY THROAT, MY HEART SINKS AND MY EYES BEGIN TO LEAK. THAT'S GOT TO BE EBOLA, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT ELSE.
I THINK THAT'S HUMANITY. HUMANITY? IS THAT CURABLE? I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT MEANS YOU ACTUALLY CARE.
STEPHEN: I DID NOT KNOW THAT. SWITCHING GEARS. YOU WERE A HELICOPTER PILOT SERVING IN WHICH THEATER?
IRAQ.
STEPHEN: OKAY. AND YOUR HELICOPTER WAS SHOT DOWN, YOU LOST BOTH YOUR LEGS AND PARTIAL USE OF ONE OF YOUR ARMS.
YES.
STEPHEN: YOU SAID WHEN YOU WERE RECOVERING IN THE HOSPITAL THAT YOUR SPOUSE STAYED BY YOUR SIDE AND YOU WANT GAYS AND LESBIANS TO HAVE THAT RIGHT AND SOMEONE BEING WITH THEM. THAT IMPLYIES YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS  TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY.
WHEN I WAS SHOT DOWN, BLEEDING TO DEATH IN MY HELICOPTER, AND AN AMERICAN G.I. CAME TO CARRY ME OUT TO SAFETY. I DIDN'T STOP TO ASK IF HE WAS STRAIGHT OR GAY. I WAS JUST GLAD HE WAS AN AMERICAN G.I.
STEPHEN: WHICH WAS HE, STRAIGHT OR GAY? WELL HE WAS THE PILOT AND I KNOW HE'S HAPPILY MARRIED.
STEPHEN: STRAIGHT? YES.
STEPHEN: SO FOR THE RECORD, 'SAVED BY STRAIGHT MAN.' LET'S GO BACK TO SOMETHING YOU WEREN'T SAYING BEFORE, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PRETEND YOU WERE, WE BOTH THINK OBAMACARE IS A DISASTER. OKAY?
I LIKE MY HEALTH INSURANCE I GET THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
STEPHEN: YOU SAID YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THAT IT HAD FLAWS AND IS FAR FROM PERFECT.
I THINK MORE AMERICANS TODAY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THAN THEY DID BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TOOK EFFECT.
STEPHEN: YOU BELIEVE EMPLOYERS SHOULD COVER THEIR EMPLOYEES' CONTRACEPTION?
I THINK EMPLOYERS SHOULD PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE WHERE THE EMPLOYEE CAN ACCESS CONTRACEPTION.
STEPHEN: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THROWING BLANKETS ON THE CONFERENCE TABLE AND SAYING  GO AT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEETING? WHAT'S ONE DIFFERENCE?
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHAT YOUR EMPLOYEE DOES IN TERMS OF THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE.
DON'T CORPORATIONS HAVE RIGHTS TO THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS? I PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL FOR MY EMPLOYEES BECAUSE I AM RELIGIOUSLY OPPOSED TO MATERNITY LEAVE.
I DON'T THINK YOU ACTUALLY PROVIDE IT. I THINK THE INSURANCE PLANS DO.
STEPHEN: NO, I ACTUALLY PROVIDE IT. I GRIND UP THE PILLS AND PUT THEM IN THE WATER BOTTLES. THE MEN ARE GROWING BREASTS, THAT'S THE HINT. BUT THEY'RE KIND OF NICE, ACTUALLY. (LAUGHTER) LAST QUESTION. YOU SUPPORT "SENSIBLE CONVERSATION" ON GUN CONTROL.
I DO. CAN'T YOU HAVE AN EVEN MORE SENSIBLE CONVERSATION IF YOU'VE GOT GUNS? BECAUSE I FIND THAT IF I'M WAVING A GUN AROUND,  PEOPLE GET VERY QUIET AND LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
THAT'S NOT A CONVERSATION. IT'S A MONOLOGUE. YEAH. SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO TAKE MY GUN.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOUR GUN, STEPHEN, BUT WE ALSO SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BUY GUNS SUCH AS THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, FELONS, SHOULD NOT HAVE EASY ACCESS WITHOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS.
REGULATION EQUALS CONFISCATION.
I DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE. BUT IT RHYMES. I GUESS. I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET'S PUT ILLINOIS'S 8TH  UP ON THE BIG BOARD! WOW! SO CLOSE TO FILLING THE WHOLE MAP BEFORE THE SHOW ENDS! I JUST HAVE TO DO TEN MORE OF THESE SEGMENTS EVERY SHOW! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
