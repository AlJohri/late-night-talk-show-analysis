Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW  YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE  NEWSPAPERS. THAT'S WHY I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO  ANY. IF I HAVE TO KILL A SPIDER, I  USE A ROLLED-UP I-PAD. BUT I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO THE  CHICAGO SUN TIMES, A PAPER  RENOWN FOR USUALLY BEING AVAILABLE FROM THE TRIB IS SOLD  OUT. THEY HAVE MANAGED TO CUT COSTS  WITHOUT LAYING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE  OFF FROM EVERY DEPARTMENT. EVERYBODY FROM ONE DEPARTMENT.
THE CHICAGO SUN TIMES IS  LAYING OFF ITS ENTIRE STAFF OF  PHOTOGRAPHERS.
THEY  AVE LAID OFF AS MANY AS  30 PEOPLE IN THEIR PHOTOGRAPHIC  TEAM THERE.
Stephen: YES, THE ENTIRE  PHOTOGRAPHY DEPARTMENT WAS LAID  OFF OR, ASSTHE SUN TIMES REPORTED IT, PHOTO NOT  AVAILABLE. BUT THE PAPER WILL CONTINUE TO  HAVE GREAA PHOTOJOURNALISM  BECAUSE REPORTERS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO LEARN I-PHONE  PHOTOGRAPHY BASICS. BUT ONLY THE BASICS LIKE  PRESSING THE BUTTON. IF THE SUN TIMES IS STILL AROUND  IN A WEEK, THE REPORTERS CAN  MOVE ON TO THE ADVANCED STUFF LIKE USING THE FLASH AND ASKING  FLOOD VICTIMS TO SAY CHEESE. OF COURSE THERE ARE THOSE WHO  THINK FIRING PHOTO JOURNALISTS  IN FAVOR OF I-PHONES IS A BAD  IDEA. FOR EXAMPLE, FIRED  PHOTOJOURNALIST AND PULITZER  PRIZE WINNER JOHN H. WHITE WHO  CLAIMS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE REPORTERS REPLACE PHOTOGRAPHERS.
YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMEONE WHO  FILLSSPRESCRIPTION BOTTLES AND  HAVE THEM DO YOUR HEART SURGERY.
Stephen: YES, YOU CAN. IF A PHARMACIST CAN OPEN ONE OF  THOSE TRIAL-PROOF CAPS OPENING  UP A CHEST CAVITY SHOULD BE A  BREEZE. IT'S THE SAME MOTION. YOU JUST PUSH DOWN AND TURN THE  NIPPLES. BESIDES, YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE A  PULITZER PRIZE WINNER TO TAKE A  GREAT PICTURE ANYMORE. JUST TAKE A CRAPPY PICTURES AND  THEN APPLY INSTAGRAM'S PULITZER  PRIZE-WINNING FILTER AND VOILA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I JUST WISH ALL OF OUR ICONIC  NEWS IMAGEE HAD BEEN TAKEN WITH  AN I-PHONE. IMAGINE THII HISTORIC PHOTO OF  THE HINDENBURG. -pYOLO THE HUMANITY. PPUS TRAINED PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE  LIMITED TO PRINTING WHAT THEY'VE  ACTUALLY TAKEN PICTURES OF. BUT I-PHONE PHOTOGRAPHERS FROM  FUN APPs THAT LET YOU MODIFY  YOUR PHOTOS WITH COSTUMES, PROPS AND GOOGLY EYES. INSTANTLY SHE'S GONE FROM  HEART-BREAKING OKIE TO OAKY  DOAKY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
