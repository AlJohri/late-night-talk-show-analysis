(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH, FOLKS. YOU KNOW AS A VETERAN POLITICAL JOURNALIST I HAVE COVERED EVERY BIG CONTEST IN THE LAST 15 YEARS. BUSH V. GORE, BUSH V. KERRY, KERRY V. PREDATOR. (LAUGHTER) BUT AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE POLITICAL HORSE RACE, I AM DISGUSTED WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS. THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS ONLY A YEAR AGO. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE MEDIA IS WASTING ITS TIME SPECULATING ON 2016 FRONT-RUNNERS. AND NEITHER CONDITION K THE 2016 FRONT-RUNNER. CHRIS CHRISTIE APPEARED ON ALL FOUR SUNDAY SHOWS TO TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH HE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. RACE.LAUGH.
GOVERNOR, HOW INTERESTED ARE YOU IN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016?
WELL, CHRIS, WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN DOING IS BEING THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON IS DOING MY JOB IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. I'M THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. FOR ME, I'M THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY AND MY JOB IS TO RUN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
Stephen: YES, HE'S JUST THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. THAT'S WHY HE WENT ON "MEET THE JERSEY" "FOX NEWS JERSEY SUNDAY" "FACE THE TURNPIKE" AND "THIS NEW JERSEY WITH NEW JERSEY NEW JERSEYOPOLIS." (LAUGHTER) AND I ADMIRE HOW DESPITE ALL THE SPECULATION, CHRISTIE STAYS HUMBLE ABOUT HIS FUTURE BY BRAGGING ONLY ABOUT HIS PAST.
ON GOVERNING IT'S ABOUT DOING THINGS, ACCOMPLISHING THINGS, REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE AND CRAFTING ACCOMPLISHMENTS. YOU KNOW, 143, NOW NEW PRIVATE SECTORS JOBS. 143,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. 143,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. 143000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. 1423,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. 143,000 NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WOW! 143,000 TIMES SEVEN MENTIONS ON T.V. EQUALS -- (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE SUNDAY SHOWS WON'T JUST LEAVE CHRIS CHRISTIE ALONE! I MEAN, THE MAN HAS GOT TO FOCUS ON GOVERNING NEW JERSEY WITH MICHAEL J. FOX AND JIMMY FALLON! I JUST HOPE HE HAS TIME TO RECORD HIS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ROBOCALLS.
HI, THIS IS CHRIS CHRISTIE. I'M NOT RUNNING FOR ANYTHING, I'M FOCUSED ON BEING GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. STOP CALLING ME! I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THESE SORTS OF BELTWAY GAMES. SPEAKING OF WHICH, BOY, SOMEBODY NEEDS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF D.C. CHRISTIE, 2016. TWO COMPLETELY UNRELATED WORDS. 143,000 JOBS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: OKAY, CABLE NEWS? YOU GOT THE MESSAGE? I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT AGAIN. BUT IF HE DOES, HE'S AVAILABLE NEXT SUNDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
