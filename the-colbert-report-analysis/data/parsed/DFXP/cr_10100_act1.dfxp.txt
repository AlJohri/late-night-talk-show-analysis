Stephen:  TONIGHT, A BIG STEP FORWARD IN GUN RIGHTS, THOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK. A NEW MONUMENT GOES UP IN OKLAHOMA CITY. SHOULD BE PRETTY CREATIVE BASED  ON HOW THEY NAME THEIR CITIES. MY GUEST IS SHOW BUSINESS LEGEND BETTE MIDLER. I'LL ASK HER "DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT I'M MY HERO?" SKIDMORE COLLEGE IS OFFERING A COURSE ON MILEY CYRUS. IT'S NOT THAT EASY THERE'S A LOT OF HOME TWERK. THIS IS THE "COLBERT REPORT."     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I JUST GOT TO WET THE WHISTLE FOR A SECOND. I JUST GOT TO WET THE WHISTLE FOR A SECOND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  SIT DOWN! I JUST WANT TO GIVE A SHOUTOUT TO ALL OF OUR FRIENDS IN BELGIUM WATCHING RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) NATION, OH, BREATHE THAT IN. SPRING IS IN THE AIR. ESPECIALLY SINCE I FIRED UP MY SWEET PEA AND LILAC GLADE PLUG-IN. REALLY MAKES IT FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES I LEAVE THIS BUILDING. AND SPRING IS THE SEASON OF LOVE WHEN, SHALL WE SAY THE BIRDS AND THE BEES GO AT IT IN A SWEATY PILE OF HARD-CORE THORAX-BEAKING. IN THIS TIME OF COURTSHIP TONGUES ARE WAGGING ABOUT ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST SOUGHT-AFTER BACHELORS, RUPERT MURDOCH. LADIES! LADIES! HE'S BREATHING! ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHO RUPERT'S CRUSHIN' ON NOW.
RAND PAUL WAS SEEN WITH MEDIA MOGUL RUPERT MURDOCH AT THE KENTUCKY DERBY LAST WEEKEND.
KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN SENATOR RAND PAUL AND MEDIA MAGNATE RUPERT MURDOCH SPENT THE DAY TOGETHER AT THE KENTUCKY DERBY. MURDOCH WAS PAUL'S SPECIAL GUEST. THERE'S SPECULATION THE JOINT PERHAPS COULD SIGN A MURDOCH ENDORSEMENT IF HE RUNS FOR PRESIDENT.
HE GOT RUPERT MURDOCH TO COME DOWN TO KENTUCKY. HE GOT HIM TO SPEND THE DAY WITH HIM, TO GET TO KNOW HIM A LITTLE.
Stephen:  YES, RAND PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS TO IMPRESS HIS DATE, RUPERT MURDOCH, EVEN WORE A FESTIVE DERBY HAT MADE OF THE FINEST GOPHER PELT. NATION, I LOVE THIS HOT NEW CELEBRITY POWER COUPLE. I HAVE EVEN GIVEN RUPERT AND RAND PAUL THEIR OWN FUN NICKNAME-- RU-PAUL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT AS HOT AS THIS DATE WAS, RAND SHOULD NOT GET TOO ATTACHED TO RUPY HERE BECAUSE MURDOCH IS STILL PLAYING THE FIELD. THERE ARE NEARLY A DOZEN REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS COURTING HIM ALREADY. HE'S LIKE A G.O.P. VERSION OF THE BACHELOR, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY ALSO WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYONE NAMED JUAN PABLO. GOOD LUCK TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE. NATION. WE ALL KNOW THE OBAMA REGIME IS DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN TO UNDERMINE THE SECOND AMENDMENT. SURE, OBAMA HASN'T UNDERMINED IT YET, BUT HE ALSO HASN'T UNDERMINED THE FIRST AMENDMENT SO GUN LOVERS STILL HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SAY HE'S UNDERMINING THE SECOND AMENDMENT WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE WHICH MAKES US LOOK NUTS, THEREBY UNDERMINING THE SECOND AMENDMENT. IT'S ALL A LONG CON. SO I WAS THRILLED TO SPEND YESTERWEEKEND WITH LIKE-MINDED PATRIOTS AT THE N.R.A.'S 2014 ANNUAL MEETING IN INDIANAPOLIS. IT WAS OVER NINE ACRES OF GUNS, GEAR, AND OUTFITTERS THAT FEATURED INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS LIEB THE STALKING SHIELD FOR THE ETHICAL HUNTER WHO WANTS TO ENSURE THEY CALL ONLY THE STUPIDEST MEMBERS OF THE HERD. THE STALKING SHIELD THEY'LL NEVER TRUST A TREE AGAIN. THE CONVENTION ALSO FEATURES SPEAKERS LIKE LOUISIANA GOVERNOR AND BOY WHO WISHED TO BE BIG, BOBBY JINDAL. WHO MADE IT CLEAR THE STAKES FACING THE N.R.A. COULD NOT BE HIGHER.
THE SAME LIBERAL EXTREMISTS WHO WANT TO COME TAKE OUR GUNS ARE THE SAME FORCES THAT WANT TO TAKE AWAY OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
Stephen:  EXACTLY! IF WE CAVE ON GUN CONTROL, NEXT COMES RELIGION CONTROL, WHICH MEANS A THREE-DAY WAITING PERIOD BEFORE I CAN BUY A BIBLE. THEN WHAT WILL I PUT IN MY BREAST POCKET TO MIRACULOUSLY PROTECT ME FROM ALL THE STRAY BULLETS FLYING AROUND. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, ALSO ON THE LECTERN OF PEOPLE WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CARING ABOUT GUNS AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WAS FORMER, FORMER SENATOR RICK SANTORUM WHO TALKED ABOUT THE CRUCIAL ROLE GUNS PLAY IN ANY HAPPY MARRIAGE.
KAREN OWNS MORE GUNS THAN I DO.  DON'T KNOW ABOUT MOST MEN,  BUT, YOU KNOW, THE DEFAULT GIFT FOR MOST MEN IS TO BUY FLOWERS ON A SPECIAL OCCASION. FOR ME, THE SAFE BET-- AMMO.
Stephen:  YES. WHY SAY IT WITH FLOWERS WHEN YOU CAN SAY IT WITH BULLETS? IT'S THE GIFT THAT GOES STRAIGHT TO SOMEONE ELSE'S HEART. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND, FOLKS-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A LOT OF AMMO FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER FOR THESE HEROS TO STAND UP FOR OUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND/OR PLASTIC OAK-BARK TUNICS. BECAUSE THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT GUN RIGHT OF ALL, CONCEALED CARRY. WHICH IS GUARANTEED BY OUR CONSTITUTION. NOW, YES, YOU CAN'T SEE IT WRITTEN IN THERE. THAT'S CAUSE IT'S CONCEALED. ( LAUGHTER ) SO I WAS HAPPY TO SEE GEORGIA'S GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL STAND UP FOR THE RIGHT TO ROCK OUT WITH YOUR GLOCK NOT OUT.
GEORGIA'S GOVERNOR HAS SIGNED A CONTROVERSIAL GUN BILL INTO LAW.
STARTING JULY 1, PEOPLE IN GEORGIA CAN BRING FIREMANS INTO BARS, LIBRARIES, CHURCHES AND EVEN SOME GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.
ITS OFFICIAL NAME IS THE "SAFE CARRY PROTECTION ACT." BUT CRITICS CALL IT THE GUNS EVERYWHERE BILL.
THAT'S RIGHT, CRITICS CALL IT THE GUNS EVERYWHERE BILL. WHILE SUPPORTERS CALL IT THE GUNS, EVERYBODY, BILL! AND WITH THIS LAW, WITH THIS LAW-- I ASSUME THEY YELL THAT AT SOMEONE NAMED BILL. WITH THIS LAW, GEORGIANS WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THEIR GUNS TO SCHOOLS, BARS, CHURCHES, AND LIBRARIES. OF COURSE, THERE YOU WILL WANT TO USE A SILENCER. BUT BEST OF ALL, BEST OF ALL, FOLKS, YOU CAN NOW EVEN PACK HEAT IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE AIRPORT, WHICH WILL FINALLY ALLOW YOU TO DEFEND THAT ONE SEAT WITH AN OUTLET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SHOCKINGLY--   ( CHEERS ) SHOCKINGLY, SHOCKINGLY, THE GUNS EVERYWHERE BILL DOESN'T COVER SOME EVERYWHERES. YES IT BROADENS CONCEALED CARRY, ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES WITH GUNS. BUT ONLY AFTER THEY'RE OUT OF JAIL. WHY CAN'T THEY CARRY GUNS IN PRISON? THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED THEM. THAT PLACE IS FULL OF CRIMINALS! THIS GUNS EVERYWHERE BILL IS A GOOD START, BUT IT STILL REQUIRES YOU TO CARRY A GUN TO HAVE A GUN. THAT'S WHY I SAY WE MUST BROADEN GUNS EVERYWHERE TO EVERYWHERE IS GUNS. ALL BUILDINGS IN AMERICA MUST PROVIDE CONCEALED WEAPONS IN EVENT OF A NONGUN-HAVING EMERGENCY. JUST USE THE GUN ON THE CHAIN TO SHOOT THE GLASS AND GRAB THE GUN. ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY WITH A GUN. AND IF EVERYBODY HAS A GUN, CHANCES ARE, AT LEAST ONE OF THEM WILL BE GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
