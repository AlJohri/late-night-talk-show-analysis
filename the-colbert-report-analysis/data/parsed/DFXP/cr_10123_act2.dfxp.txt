[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU, FOLKS, AS A MILLENNIAL, I ALWAYS KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST HASHTAG MEMES FROM THE AT INTERNET DOT APP. FOR INSTANCE, HAVE YOU SEEN THE IRAQI MILITARY SPOKESMAN  WHOSE NAME IS SAAD MAAN? IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THE SITUATION THERE IS TRAAGAAC. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER STAR BLOWING UP THE INNER TUBES RIGHT NOW, AND HIS NAME IS JEREMY MEEKS. AND HE'S YOUR CLASSIC BAD BOY. IN THAT POLICE IN STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA, BELIEVE HIM TO BE QUITE DANGEROUS.
MAN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL BE FORMALLY CHARGED TODAY IN A WEAPONS CASE, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY HE'S GETTING ALL THIS ATTENTION. LOOK AT THIS FACE.
MEET JEREMY MEEKS. HIS MUGSHOT HAS GONE VIRAL. ALL OVER FACEBOOK AND ALL OVER THE WORLD. ON STOCKTON'S PAGE, MORE THAN 24,000 LIKES AND MORE THAN. 6,000 COMMENTS. VANESSA VIEIRA WRITING, "IF THIS GUY BROKE INTO MY HOUSE,  I'D MAKE HIM FORGET WHY HE BROKE IN WITHIN 30 SECONDS. LOL." LEIDY SANTIAGO: "I'VE GOT 50 SHADES ON THAT MAN! OH GOD YES!
Stephen:  OH, GOD, YES. JUST LOOK AT HIM, THAT JAW LINE, THOSE BABY BLUES. I MEAN GUN TO MY HEAD, I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT HE'S IN FOR. FOLKS, MEEKS' FANS SEE HIM AS MORE THAN A PRETTY FACE. THEY BELIEVE HE HAS THE SKILLS TO TURN AROUND HIS LIFE USING HIS PRETTY FACE. WITH COMMENTS LIKE GET AN AGENT IN TRAINING. I WANT TO SEE YOU IN THE MOVIES. AND HE SHOULD BE FREED AND MODELING SOMEWHERE, YES HE COULD BE MAKING A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY LIKE WALKING BACK AND FORTH ON AN ELEVATED PLATFORM, LOOKING BORED ABOUT HIS CAPE. [LAUGHTER] AND THE INTERNET IS ALREADY LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR HIS FUTURE CAREER BY PHOTOSHOPING HIM INTO ADS FOR DOLCE & GABBANA, CALVIN KLEIN AND HUGO BOSS, A TACTIC THAT SO FAR HAS NOT WORKED FOR THOSE SEEKING THE RELEASE OF CHARLES MANSON. [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, THIS STORY, I GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS MAN, THIS STORY GIVES ME HOPE FOR AMERICA'S BROKEN PRISON SYSTEM. SEE, ONE OUT OF EVERY 18 MEN IN THIS COUNTRY IS INCARCERATED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE YOUNG LIVES TRAPPED IN A CYCLE OF POVERTY, VIOLENCE AND IMPRISONMENT, YOU START TO REALIZE, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE TOTAL UGGOS. [LAUGHTER] FOR INSTANCE, LOOK AT THE TRAGIC, LESS-THAN-HOTNESS OF THE MEN MEEKS WAS ARRESTED WITH. SORRY, BUT NO ONE IS STARTING A FACEBOOK PAGE TITLED "FREE THESE GUYS. THEY'VE GOT A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR." JEREMY MEEKS PROVES THAT OUR PRISONS DON'T NEED REFORM. THEY NEED MAKEOVERS. WATCH THIS. GUILTY, NOT GUILTY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, STILL A LITTLE BIT NAUGHTY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HELLO.
