Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CREATOR OF "BREAKING BAD." HE HAD BETTER TREAD LIGHTLY. PLEASE WELCOME VINCE GILL LANN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) VINCE GILLIGAN! HEY, VINCE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN! THANKS FOR COMING BACK, MAN. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU, TOO.
Stephen: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU WERE JUST STARTING TO WRITE THE LAST SEASON WE JUST SAW, CORRECT?
YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen: HOW DID IT GO? I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH. (LAUGHTER)
IT SEEMED TO GO WELL.
Stephen: IT SURE DID, MAN. YOU ARE THE MAN OF THE HOUR, OKAY? FIRST QUESTION. WHY STOP? (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO CASH? BECAUSE A.M.C. MUST HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR YOU TO KEEP THIS THING GOING BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE ON A ROCKET RIDE TO BANKTOWN! 10.3 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHED IT LAST NIGHT.
I KNOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
Stephen: BLEW THE DOOR OFF ALL YOUR PREVIOUS RATINGS.
AMAZING, AMAZING.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THE PREMIER? THE VERY FIRST SHOW, WHAT WAS THAT?
THE PREMIER WAS PROBABLY UNDER A MILLION VIEWERS. WE WENT UP AGAINST SOME BIG FOOTBALL GAME AND WE GOT -- WE JUST GOT CRUSHED AND -- SO IT WAS NICE ENDING ON THE HIGHEST VIEWERSHIP WE EVER HAD. THAT WAS WONDERFUL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMMY.
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMMY, MY FRIEND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I WASN'T FISHING, BUT IT TOOK YOU ALMOST 90 SECONDS TO SAY THAT. (LAUGHTER) LET'S TALK ABOUT WALTER FOR A SECOND. YOU'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS EVIL GUY IN YOUR HEAD FOR OVER SIX YEARS NOW. IS IT GOING TO BE HARD TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE?
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S -- YEAH, I THINK IT WILL BE HARD. MY WRITERS, MY SIX WRITERS AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS GUY AND, YEAH, HE'S A TOUGH GUY TO HAVE STUCK IN YOUR HEAD FOR 24 HOURS A DAY, SIX YEARS STRAIGHT.
Stephen: PEOPLE ASK ME SOMETIMES, LIKE, WHEN DID WALTER LOSE YOU? HE NEVER LOST ME.
OKAY.
Stephen: I WAS WITH HIM TO THE VERY END. IT ALL MADE SENSE TO ME.
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD.
Stephen: DIDN'T ALWAYS ROOT FOR HIM BUT IT ALWAYS MADE SENSE TO ME.
YEAH, NOW THAT'S -- I'M GLAD. HE ALWAYS MADE SENSE TO ME, TOO. IF THE CHARACTER NEVER MADE SENSE TO US AS WRITERS OR TO BRYAN CRANSTON AS THE GUY PLAYING HIM THAT WOULD BE TOUGH TO -- HE NEVER LOST US THAT WAY.
Stephen: WERE YOU ROOTING FOR HIM?
THERE WAS TIMES IT BECAME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ROOT FOR HIM BECAUSE HE WAS KIND OF A BASTARD A LOT OF TIMES. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST EVIL THING HE DID? WHEN HE BROKE BAD, WHAT'S THE WORST HE BROKE IN YOUR OPINION?
I THINK NASTIEST THING HE EVER DID-- SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT--
Stephen: HOLD ON ONE SECOND. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, I TELL YOU WHAT, MUTE YOUR TELEVISION, GO TO YOUTUBE AND WATCH THIS VIDEO OF A GET TO HAVING A BATH FOR THE FIRST TIME. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WE FINISH SPOILING, I'LL HOLD THE UNMUTE SIGN UP. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONE. WE'RE GONE. LET RIP. LET RIP.
YOU KNOW E WHAT? IT WAS TWO EPISODES AGO, IT WAS AN EPISODE THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHERE WALT SAID TO JESSE WITH APPARENT GLEE "I WATCHED JANE DIE. SHE CHOKED TO DEATH AND I COULD HAVE SAVED HER AND I DIDN'T." I THINK THAT WAS THE MOST SADISTIC NASTY THING.
Stephen: WORSE THAN WATCHING HER DIE AND NOT HELPING? (LAUGHTER)
YES, YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT HE WATCHED HER DIE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICTING EMOTIONS GOING ON IN HIS FACE AND HE IS -- HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT BUT HE THINKS IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR JESSE BECAUSE SHE'S HICKED HIM ON HEROIN -- HOOKED HIM ON HEROIN AND YOU SEE HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT. BUT PURE SADISM IS NOT SOMETHING WALT -- ODDLY ENOUGH, WITH ALL THE EVIL THINGS HE DID HE WAS NOT PURELY SADISTIC VERY OFTEN. AT THAT TIME THAT WAS THE MOST SADISTIC, I THINK, TELLING JESSE THAT HE WATCHED.
Stephen: WHY-- AGAIN, SPOILER ALERT. WHY KILL WALT OFF AT THE END? I MEAN, WHY NOT KEEP HIM GOING AT LEAST IN "THE WALKING DEAD"? (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, JUST MOVE HIM OVER TO THE NEXT PROJECT. (LAUGHTER) HE'LL GET EVEN SMARTER FROM EATING ALL THOSE BRAINS! (LAUGHTER)
THAT IS A GOOD THOUGHT.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU DECIDE HE HAD TO GO?
IT SEEMED LIKE THE IMPLICIT PROMISE IN THE SHOW FROM THE FIRST EPISODE. THE FIRST EPISODE HE IS TOLD HE HAS TWO YEARS TO LIVE THEREABOUTS. AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD -- WE SHOULD ADHERE TO OUR PROMISE WE IMPOLICEDLY MADE THE AUDIENCE -- MAYBE NOT IMPLICITLY, EXPLICITLY.
Stephen: HE'S GOT CANCER AT THE BEGINNING.
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: DOES HE BECOME A CANCER? (LAUGHTER)
I THINK HE ACTUALLY DOES. I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT.
Stephen: WAS THAT DEEP OF ME? WAS I DEEP JUST NOW? (LAUGHTER)
EXTREMELY DEEP.
Stephen: WILL YOU HOLD ON? I'D LOVE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE. I'LL GET MORE DEEPNESS. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK AND WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK MORE.
RIGHT ON.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE VINCE GILLIGAN "BREAKING BAD." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
