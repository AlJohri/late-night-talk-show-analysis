Stephen: HI, EVERYBODY,  THANKS FOR BEING IN HERE  TONIGHT, NERVE HERE AND OUT THERE WATCHING. I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM "THE REPORT"  FOR A WEEK BECAUSE ONE WEEK AGO  TODAY MY MOTHER LORNA COLBERT DIED AND I WANT TO THANK  EVERYBODY WHO OFFERED THEIR  THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. NOW IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW AND  YOU LIKE THIS SHOW THAT'S  BECAUSE OF EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HERE AND I'M LUCKY TO BE ONE OF  THEM. BUT WHEN YOU WATCH THE SHOW, IF  YOU ALSO LIKE ME, THAT'S BECAUSE  OF MY MOM. SO BEFORE WE START THE SHOW  AGAIN, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A  LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER. SHE WAS BORN JUST A LITTLE WAYS  FROM HERE IN LARCHMONT NEW YORK  ON CHATSWORTH AVENUE IN 1920. THE SAME WEEK WOMEN FIRST GOT  THE RIGHT TO VOTE. SHE SPENT HER SUMMERS IN THE  ADIRONDACKS WITH HER OLDER  SISTER COLLEEN AND HER YOUNGER BROTHER ED WHO CALLED HER  SNODGRASS. (LAUGHTER)  SHE MET MY FATHER JAMES AT AGE  12 AT COTILLION AND SHE LIKED  HIM BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KNOW HOW MUCH SO SHE WOULD MAKE  HER FRIENDS RIDE THEIR BIKES ALL  THE WAY ACROSS TOWN TO PASS BY HIS HOUSE BUT THEN SHE WOULD  NEVER LOOK TO SEE IF HE WAS IN  THE FRONT YARD. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH, OF COURSE, DROVE HER  FRIEND CRAZY AND EVIDENTLY SHE  ALSO DROVE MY FATHER CRAZY BECAUSE THEY WERE MARRIED AND  PROMPTLY HAD 11 CHILDREN. (LAUGHTER)  SHE MADE A VERY LOVING HOME FOR  US. NO FIGHT BETWEEN SIBLINGS COULD  END WITHOUT HUGS AND KISSES. THOUGH HUGS NEVER NEEDED A  REASON IN HER HOUSE. SINGING AND DANCING WERE  ENCOURAGED-- EXCEPT AT THE  DINNER TABLE. SHE TRAINED TO BE AN ACTRESS  WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER AND SHE  WOULD TEACH US HOW TO DO STAGE FALLS BY PRETENDING TO FAINT ON  THE KITCHEN FLOOR. (LAUGHTER)  SHE WAS FUN. SHE KNEW MORE THAN HER SHARE OF  TRAGEDY, LOSING HER BROTHER AND  HER HUSBAND AND THREE OF HER  SONS. BUT HER LOVE FOR HER FAMILY AND  HER FAITH IN GOD SOMEHOW GAVE  HER THE STRENGTH NOT ONLY TO GO ON BUT TO LOVE LIFE WITHOUT  BITTERNESS AND TO INSTILL IN ALL  OF US A GRATITUDE FOR EVERY DAY WE HAVE TOGETHER. AND I KNOW IT MAY SOUND GREEDY  TO WANT MORE DAYS WITH A PERSON  WHO LIVED SO LONG, BUT THE FACT THAT MY MOTHER WAS 92 DOES NOT  DIMINISH IT, IT ONLY MAGNIFY IT  IS ENORMITY OF THE ROOM WHOSE DOOR HAS NOW QUIETLY SHUT. IN HER LAST DAYS MY MOTHER  OCCASIONALLY BECAME CONFUSED AND  TO TRY TO GROUND HER WE ASKED SIMPLE QUESTIONS LIKE "WHAT'S  YOUR FAVORITE COLOR? WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SONG?"  SHE COULDN'T ANSWER THESE. BUT WHEN ASKED WHAT HER FAVORITE  PRAYER WAS SHE IMIMMEDIATELY  RECITED "A CHILD'S PRAYER" IN GERMAN THAT SHE USED TO SAY TO  MY ELDEST BROTHERS AND SISTERS  IN BEDTIME WHEN THEY WERE LIVING IN MUNICH IN THE LATE 14940s. HER FAVORITE MEMORY OF PRAYER  WAS A YOUNG HER TUCKING IN HER  CHILDREN. WE WERE THE LIGHT OF HER LIFE  AND SHE LET US KNOW IT UNTIL THE  END. AND THAT'S IT. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. NOW WE CAN GET TO THE TRULY  IMPORTANT WORK OF TELEVISION  BROADCASTING, WHICH IS WHAT SHE WOULD WANT ME TO DO. WHEN I WAS LEAVING HER LAST  WEEK, I LEANED OVER AND I SAID  "MOM, I'M GOING BACK TO NEW YORK TO DO THE SHOW."  AND SHE SAID "I CAN'T WAIT TO  SEE IT. I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE  WORLD."  SO WITH THAT IN MIND THIS IS THE  "THE COLBERT REPORT."  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  "REPORT," GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH  US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FOLKS, IF YOU ARE A LONG-TIME  WATCHER OF THIS PROGRAM -- I  MEAN, IF YOU REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME, YOU KNOW --  PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, LONG TIME VIEWERS OF THIS  SHOW WILL KNOW THERE IS NO  BIGGER SUPPORTER OF THE MILITARY THAN YOURS TRULY. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FELLA AT  THE END OF THIS BUSINESS. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S WHY AT THE SLIGHTEST HINT  OF WORLD CONFLICT I AM ALWAYS  THE FIRST TO YELL "LET'S GO TO WAR!"  AND "OW, MY BACK!"  (LAUGHTER)  BUT A HUGE MILITARY SCANDAL HAS  JUST BROKEN AND IT'S REALLY SHAKEN MY TRUST IN OUR FIGHTING  FORCES.
CAP'N CRUNCH APPARENTLY ONLY  HAS THREE STRIPES AND A WRITER  FOR WWW.FOOD'S BE.COM SAYING IF YOU LOOK AT THE NAVY'S CAPTAIN  RANK SHOULD HAVE FOUR STRIPES. A COMMANDER HAS THREE SO HE'S  NOT A CAPTAIN AT ALL. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT! IT TURNS OUT ALL THIS TIME THIS  CAP'N WAS ACTUALLY A COMMANDRA. (LAUGHTER)  OH CAP'N MY CAP'N. (LAUGHTER)  HOW COULD YOU? THIS WHOLE TIME YOU'VE BEEN PART  OF A BALANCED BETRAYAL! (LAUGHTER)  THE ONLY REASON I ATE A SERIAL  THAT LOOKED LIKE THE ROTTEN  TEETH OF A PIRATE ON SHORE LEAVE WAS BECAUSE I WAS LED TO BELIEVE  THAT HE WAS AN ACTIVE DUTY U.S. NAVAL CAPTAIN! I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPORTING THE  TROOPS. (LAUGHTER)  IF HORATIO MAGELLAN CRUNCH--  LOOK IT UP--  (LAUGHTER)  IS LYING ABOUT THIS, WHAT ELSE IS HE LYING ABOUT, FOLKS? ARE CRUNCHBERRIES NOT ACTUAL  FRUIT? (LAUGHTER)  DID HE REALLY DEFEAT SOGGIES? AND IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE  DISTURBING RUMORS THAT IN THE  1940s HE WAS KNOWN AS KIPTAN VON KRUNCH? THE MOST FEARED U-BOAT CAPTAIN  IN THE FUHRER'S KRIEGSMARINE? I HOPE NOT! I SURE HOPE NOT! NOW, CRUNCH HAS TRIED TO PUT  THIS STORY TO REST BY ACTUALLY  TWEETING TODAY "REGARDING TODAY'S RUMORS, OF COURSE I'M A  CAP'N. IT'S THE CRUNCH, NOT THE  CLOTHES, THAT MAKE A MAN."  (LAUGHTER)  HASHTAG PAIDMYDUES. HASHTAG BULL (BLEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I BET YOU ANYTHING HE DIDN'T PAY  HIS DUES. I BET HE SENT IN TEN BOX TOPS. (LAUGHTER)  FOLKS, I AM CALLING FOR A  CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION! HOW FAR DOES THIS SERIAL SCANDAL  SPREAD? IS GENERAL MILLS JUST A COLONEL? (LAUGHTER)  IS COUNT CHOCULA JUST  MR. CHOCULA? (LAUGHTER)  AND WHAT ABOUT FROSTED FLAKES. WE WILL FIND OUT THEY'RE  ADEQUATE? (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I JUST HOPE AND PRAY -- I JUST  HOPE THIS SCANDAL DOESN'T SPREAD TO THE NUMBER-ONE CHILDREN'S  SERIAL MASCOT, KASHI GOOD  FRIENDS. (LAUGHTER)  I THINK WE DESERVE TO KNOW. ARE THEY REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WHO  ENJOY HIGH FIBER? OR ARE THEY JUST BUSINESS  ASSOCIATES WHO SYNCHRONIZE THEIR  BOWL MOVEMENTS FOR MARKETING  PURPOSES? (LAUGHTER)  LIKE A CLOCK. FOLKS, I BELIEVE IN SAYING  WHATEVER'S ON MY MIND RIGHT  AFTER IT'S BEEN PUT INTO THIS LITTLE TELEPROMPTER UP HERE. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF  THE FINGER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FIRST UP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET IN THAT THERE IS  STILL A HOUSING MARKET. (LAUGHTER)  JIM?
HOUSE FLIPPING IS BACK.
Stephen: HOUSE FLIPPING? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.
I'M NOT KIDDING. HOUSE TIPPING. REALTY TRACK SAYS THESE ARE THE  BEST PLACES TO FLIP A HOUSE. NUMBER ONE: ORLANDO, ALSO ON THE  LIST, LAS VEGAS, PHOENIX, TAMPA. SEE THE COMMON DENOMINATOR? THESE STATES AND CITIES TOPPED  THE LIST OF THE FORECLOSURE  CRISIS.
THEY WERE GOBBLED UP BY HEDGE  FUNDS AND NOW THE HEDGE FUNDS  ARE NOW RENTING BACK TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY  HOMES.
NATION, THIS IS THE FREE  MARKET AT ITS BEST. BANKS OVERLEND TO HOMEOWNERS AND  THEN FORECLOSE ON THEM THEN RENT  THEM BACK THEIR FORMER HOMES. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  IT'S LIKE BEING A METH DEALER  WHO IS ALSO A DENTIST. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH REMINDS ME I NEED TO GET A  CHECK UP WITH SPIDER. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A BIG TIP  OF MY HAT TO WALL STREET FOR  THIS GREAT MONEY-MAKING  INNOVATION. BUT SADLY NOT EVERYONE'S ON  BOARD. LIKE ONE CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE  AGENT WHO WORRIED THE THINGS  THAT SCARES ME IS THE VALUES GOING UP SO QUICKLY. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE AND  THAT'S WHAT'S SCARING ME. IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN  (LAUGHS)  NO! THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! THE FIRST TIME WALL STREET  INVESTORS PUMPED MONEY INTO THE  REAL ESTATE MARKET CAUSING A MASSIVE BUBBLE THAT LED TO AN  ECONOMIC CRISIS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  THIS TIME WALL STREET INVESTORS  ARE PUMPING MONEY INTO THE REAL ESTATE MARKET CAUSING A MASSIVE  BUBBLE THAT WILL LEAD TO  PROSPERITY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AS THE OLD SAYING GOES, THOSE  WHO FORGET THE PAST ARE DOOMED TO MAKE MAD DOLLARS! (LAUGHTER)  NEXT AMERICA'S ROADS AREN'T WHAT  THEY USED TO BE AND I WOULD TELL  THE NATION'S HIGHWAYS MYSELF BUT THEY'RE STILL UPSET SINCE  FINDING OUT THEY WERE ADOPTED. (LAUGHTER)  AND SADLY -- I KNOW, I KNOW. AND SADLY STATE GOVERNMENTS  SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO  REPAIR THEM. THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING THE NEXT  TIP OF MY HAT TO NORTH CAROLINA  FOR FINDING AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO PAY FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION.
OWNERS OF HYBRIDS AND  ELECTRIC CARS IN NORTH CAROLINA  MAY BE HIT WITH HIGHER FEES BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY THE SAME  AMOUNT OF GAS TAX AS DRIVERS OF  TRADITIONAL CARS.
THE PROPOSED STATE SENATE  BUDGET CALLS FOR AN INCREASE ON  TOP OF THE ANNUAL REGISTRATION  FEE.
THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL ON  THE TABLE NOW CALLS FOR $50  ADDED FOR HYBRID OWNERS, $100 TACKED ON FOR ANYONE WHO DRIVES  AN ELECTRIC CAR.
Stephen: THANK GOD! I SAY IT'S HIGH TIME WE PUNISH  THE ECK COTKWAOEPS. THEY SHOULD BE BUYING GASOLINE  WHEN THEY NEED IT OR NOT. (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO WITH  IT, SET FIRE TO A DENNY'S. (LAUGHTER)  IN FACT, --  (APPLAUSE). IN FACT, FOLKS, I THINK MAYBE  THIS IS JUST ME, I THINK NORTH  CAROLINA SHOULD GO AFTER ALL FREELOADER TRANSPORTATION THAT  USES PUBLIC ROADS BUT DOESN'T  PAY INTO THE SYSTEM. PEDESTRIANS SHOULD BE HIT WITH A  WALKING TAX. (LAUGHTER)  BICYCLISTS SHOULD BE HIT WITH A  BIKE TAX. AND UNICYCLISTS SHOULD JUST BE  HIT. (LAUGHTER)  WHY STOP AT ROADS? PLENTY OF PEOPLE MAKE LIFE-STYLE  CHOICES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT  STATE BUDGETS. LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WHO QUIT  SMOKING. THAT HAS CAUSED CIGARETTE TAX  REVENUE TO DECLINE, TAX WHICH IS  GO TO FUND CANCER RESEARCH! (LAUGHTER)  YOU HEAR THAT? PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE FROM  LUNG CANCER BECAUSE YOU REFUSE  TO SMOKE! (LAUGHTER)  THANKS FOR SPREADING YOUR  SECOND-HAND HEALTH YOU SELFISH  JERKS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
