IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BRING  YOU THE TRUTH RIGHT DOWN THE  TRUTH HOLE. NATION, FOR YEARS I HAVE ADMIRED  "O," THE OPRAH BOOK CLIB. AND WHILE LADY "O" AND I ARE  VERY CLOSE, WE'RE ALSO  COMPETITORS. WE'RE NOT IN SHOW FRIENDSHIP. WE'RE IN SHOW BUSINESS. THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I AM PROUD TO  INTRODUCE THE START OF MY OWN  BOOK CLUB, C-OH-LBERT BOOK CLUB. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT IS GOING TO BE A LITERARY  PHENOMENA OF NARRATIVE  DECONSTRUCTION AND SYMBOLIC ANALYSIS, PLUS TOGETHER, WE WILL  DISCOVER HOW MANY COPIES OF THE  BOOK YOU'LL NEED TO LEVEL YOUR KITCHEN TABLE. ( LAUGHTER ). AND OUR VERY FIRST BOOK IS CAN CAN  REAT GATSBY" BY F. SCOTTIS "THEG  FITZGERALD. FOLKS, WE'RE READYING IT FOR ALL  THE RIGHT REASONS-- BECAUSE  THERE'S A MOVIE OF IT COMING  OUT. THIS WAY AT THE PREMIERE ON MAY  10, WE CAN SMUGLY TURN TO OUR  FRIENDS AND SAY, "THE BOOK WAS BETTER."  THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY I'M PRETTY  SURE THE MOVIE IS GOING TO BE  AMAZING. IT'S IN 3D. THAT'S RIGHT! IT FEELS LIKE THE THEMES OF  LONGING AND ALIENATION ARE IN  YOUR PIPES. PLUS, A SOUNDTRACK BY JAY-Z,  JUST LIKE F. SCOTT FIT-ZEE WOULD  HAVE WANTED. NOW, SURE, THE "THE GREAT  GATSBY" HERE IS ALREADY  CONSIDERED TO BE AN AMERICAN  CLASSIC, BUT NOTHING IS AN AMERICAN CLASSIC UNTIL I SAY IT  IS. WHICH IS WHY I'M CALLING ON YOU,  THOSE FEW LIT RAMEMBERS OF THE  COLBERT NATION, TO PICK THUP BOOK AND-- THIS IS WHERE IT GETS  TRICKY-- READ THE WORDS INSIDE  OF IT, OKAY? ( LAUGHTER )  YOU HAVE TWO WEEKS TO FINISH IT,  NATION. BECAUSE ON MAY 9, PULITZER  PRIZE-WINNING NOVELIST JENNIFER  EGAN WILLED LEAD THE BOOK CLUB'S DISCUSSION AND THE DIRECTOR OF  THE MOVIE, BAZ LUHRMAN, WILL BE  HERE IN 3D. ( LAUGHTER )  TOGETHER, TOGETHER--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE WILL DECIDE WHAT IT'S GERALD REALLY MEANT WHEN HE SAY, "SO WE  BEAT OBOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT,  BORNE BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST."  IT'S THE NAME OF HIS CHILDHOOD  SLED. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  FOLKS, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT  CRAYONS ARE A LOT LIKE PEOPLE-- THEY MAY COME IN DIFFERENT  COLORS, BUT INSIDE, THEY'RE ALL  THE SAME FLAVOR. ( LAUGHTER )  AND WE WOULD NOT HAVE CRAYONS IF  IT WERE NOT FOR THE CRAYOLA  COMPANY OF EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH IS IN THE SUBJECT OF THE  68th INSTALLMENT OF MY  434-PART SERIES "BETTER KNOW A DISTRICT."  TONIGHT, THE FIGHTIN' 17th. THE 17th IS HOME TO THE  OLDEST BREWERY IN THE UNITED  STATES, YUENGLING, WHOSE NAME IS ANANG LISIZED VERSION OF THE  GERMAN WORD JUNGLING, WHICH  MEANS YOUNG BOY. BUT IF YOU'RE EVER IN A BAR AND  THEY OFFER YOU A YOUNG BOY,  PLEASE ALERT AUTHORITIES  IMMEDIATELY. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )  NOW THE 17th WAS ONCE HOME  TO PAPA BEAR BILL O'REILLY WHO  CUT HIS TEETH AS A REPORTER FOR  NEPWILLS-BARRY-SCRONTON. IT IS THERE WHERE HE TESTED OUT  THE NO SPIN ZONE, THE STAY STILL  SPOT AND LACK OF ROTATION AREA. AND JUST WHO HAS THE SCRAP TOLL  REPRESENT THIS CORNER OF  PENNSYLVANIA, IT'S NONE OTHER THAN FIRST TERM CONGRESSMAN MATT  CARTWRIGHT. I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE  CARTWRIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE  NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. CONGRESSMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
MY PLEASURE. I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  WELL, THE FEELING  IS MUTUAL?
THANK YOU.
Stephen:  I MEAN ABOUT ME.
YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF YOURSELF.
Stephen:  I AM.
YOU SHOULD BE.
Stephen:  THANK YOU VERY  MUCH, THANK YOU. I THINK WE MIGHT BE DONE. WE HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS,  OKAY. MY APOLOGIES. I GOT WHAT I NEEDED. ( LAUGHTER ). OKAY, I STILL HAVE TO ASK SOME  QUESTIONS. CONGRESSMAN, TELL ME ABOUT THE  FIGHTIN' 17th.
WELL, THE FIGHTIN' 17th  IS THE NEW DISTRICT IN  NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. IT'S COMPOSED OF SCRANTON,  WILKES-BARRE.
THE CRAYOLA COMPANY IS IN  YOUR DISTRICT, RIGHT?
RIGHT, THAT'S DOWN IN EASTON.
Stephen:  HOW DO YOU FEEL  ABOUT RECENT PLANS TO RENAME THE  WHITE CRAYON REPUBLICAN?
I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT.
Stephen:  DO NOT AGREE WITH  THAT. ( LAUGHTER ). NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO  IMMIGRATION, YOU SAY YOU'D LIKE  TO TURN UNDOIMENTED WORKERS INTO  TAXPAYERS.
I THINK I AGREE WITH THE  PRESIDENT'S APPROACH THAT WE  HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH BUT FAIR PROCESS TO, THE PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP.
Stephen:  LET'S CALL IT  AMNESTY, SHAM-NESTY AS I CALL  IT.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S  APPROACH IS THE RIGHT ONE. WE'RE NOT ABOUT TO DEPORT 11  MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE DOING JOBS THAT NOBODY  ELSE WANTS TO DO.
Stephen:  LIKE WHAT?
LIKE TRANSIENT FARM WORKING  JOBS.
I DON'T CARE WHAT SEX THEY  ARE AS LONG AS THEY PICK OUR  VEGETABLES.
TRANSIENT FARM WORKERS ARE  PEOPLE WHO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE  TO THE NEXT.
Stephen:  RIGHT, BECAUSE NO  ONE WANTS A TRANSIENT. I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO  PICK VEGETABLES.
TRANSIENT FARM WORKERS DON'T  HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE--  WITH TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.
Stephen:  ANOTHER MY  APOLOGIES. MY APOLOGIES TO MEXICANS. ( LAUGHTER )  SPEAKING OF WHICH, THE HISPANIC  VOTE WAS KEY TO THE DEMOCRATIC  VICTORY IN 2012, TRUE?
I THINK SO.
Stephen:  HOW DID YOU  PANDER TO THOSE VOTERS? ( LAUGHTER )  IN ESPANOL?
I'M AFRAID MY SPAN SISH QUITE  POOR.
Stephen:  LET ME HELP YOU  OUT TO APPEAL TO FANNISH VOTERS  JUST REPEAT AFTER ME. I CARUMBA. JUST SAY, HEY, YOU GUYS. EYE CARUMBA.
ICARUMBA.
SALIR.
SAL IR.
Stephen:  ME BARRIO. BARRIO.ME
Stephen:  REPUBLICANS WOULD  NEVER SAY THAT TO YOU BECAUSE  THEY DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH? ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, A FELLOW ROMAN CATHOLIC?
YES.
UP HERE, RIGHT UP HERE. BOOM. ONE TRUE BRIDE OF CHRIST, RIGHT?
SURE YOU.
Stephen:  CAN'T SAY THAT  WHEN PROTESTANTS ARE AROUND. IT'S SO SAD THEY'RE GOING TO  HELL AND WE'RE NOT, ISN'T IT? I'LL MISS THEM. THERE ARE SOME GOOD ONES.
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD ONES.
Stephen:  YUP. I SALUTE YOU FOR PUTTING THE  TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH ABOVE  POLITICS. SO FEW DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO  DO THAT. DOES IT CAUSE TROUBLE WITH THE  REST OF THE DEMOCRAT THALZ YOU  OPPOSE BIRTH CONTROL AND ARE OPPOSED TO HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGE?
I AM A SUPPORTER OF MARRIAGE  ECOMMONWEALTH.
Stephen:  I BELIEVE ALL  MARRIAGES SHOULD BE EQUAL. EVERY LEGITIMATE MARRIAGE  SHOULD, THAT'S A MAN AND A  WOMAN. NO ONE'S MARRIAGE IS BETTER THAN  OTHERS. MINE IS-- MINE IS ACTUALLY  BETTER, BUT LEGALLY, NO ONE'S  MARRIAGE SHOULD BE BETTER THAN OTHERS AS LONG AS IT IS A  LEGITIMATE MARRIAGE.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S  MARRIAGE IS BETTER THAN MINE. MY WIFE, MARION, AND I HAVE BEEN  TOGETHER FOR 27 YEARS. AND WE BOTH SUPPORT MARRIAGE  EQUALITY FOR THE  L.G.B.T. POPULATION. THERE'S NO REASON TO  DISCRIMINATE.
Stephen:  THE WHO? WHAT'S THE L.G.B.T.?
LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND  TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.
SO YOU WANT LESBIANS, GAYS,  BISEXUALS, AND THOSE TRANSIENTS  WHO PICK MY VEGETABLES. GAY PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN. THE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE IS TO  HAVE CHILDREN. GAY PEOPLE CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN. YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT? YOU BE HOW BABIES ARE MADE? ( LAUGHTER )
THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT  PEOPLE --
Stephen:  I HAVE TO GET TO  THE FIRST QUESTION. YOU KNOW HOW BABIES ARE MADE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE  ON THE SAME PAG.
I'M AWARE OF HOW BABIES ARE  MADE.
Stephen:  AND YOU KNOW GAY  PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT NOT MUCH OF  AN ARGUMENT WHEN ST. PETER JUDGES YOU AT THE GATES UPON  HEAVEN.  "HEY, YOU WERE AGAINST  THE LAW OF GOD."  WHAT! ( LAUGHTER )  LET'S MOVE ON. DO YOU REMEMBER SEVERAL  CAUCUSES, INCLUDING THE  CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS,  TRUE?
I DON'T THINK I AM IN THAT  ONE.
Stephen:  YOU'RE NOT IN THE  CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS?
I DON'T THINK I AM.
Stephen:  IT SAYS HERE ARE  YOU-- OH, I'M SORRY, THE BIKE  CAUCUS. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY RODE BIKES. ANYWAY, OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ). OH, THIS IS EMBARRASSING. I NEVER LEARNED TO RIDE A BIKE.
OOOH!
Stephen:  NEVER LEARNED. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO RIDE A BIKE?
SURE.
Stephen:  WOULD YOU BE  WILLING TO TEACH ME?
I COULD DO THAT.
Stephen:  REALLY? ( LAUGHTER )
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
Stephen:  LET'S GO, OKAY,  OKAY.
ARE YOU READY?
Stephen:  I GOT IT, I GOT  IT, I GOT IT. I'M DOING IT! I'M DOING IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I DID IT. I DID IT. LET'S PUT PENNSYLVANIA 17th  UP ON THE BIG BOARD! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I HOPE THAT DISTRICT JUST  TWINKLED OR I THINK I'VE GOT A  CONCUSSION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
