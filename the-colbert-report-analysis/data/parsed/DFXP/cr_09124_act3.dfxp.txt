Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO MY  EIGHT-PART SERIES WITH JERRY  SEINFELD. JERRY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHY DID YOU DO THIS SHOW?
IT'S A VERY PERSONAL LITTLE  THING. I DID IT AS AN EXPERIMENT LAST  YEAR, AND I PUT IT ON THE  INTERNET WITHOUT TELLING ANYBODY, NO PRESS, NO INTERVIEW,  NO ADS, NOTHING. PEOPLE STARTED TO LIKE IT.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE TO PAY? TO BE ON IT. Stephen: NO, TO WATCH IT. NO, IT'S FREE. IT'S FREE.
Stephen: DO YOU GET PAID TO  DO IT?
WE'RE MAKING ENOUGH MONEY TO  KEEP DOING IT. AT THIS POINT. THANK TO THE ACCURA CAR COMPANY  AFTER WE MADE THE ONES LAST  YEAR, THEY SAID WE'LL PAY FOR YOU TO MAKE SOME MORE.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO  PUT A GRAPHIC OF ACCURA UP RIGHT  NOW.
YES. IF THEY HADN'T SAID WE'LL DO  THIS. THAT WOULD BE THE END OF IT.
Stephen: IF IT WASN'T FOR FAT  POCKETS, WE WOULDN'T BE TALKING  RIGHT NOW. BY THE WAY, ACCURA AND HOT  POCKETS ARE MADE OUT OF THE SAME  MATERIAL. I'M NOT A COMEDIAN BUT I'M  INTERESTED IN COMEDIANS. WHO DID YOU LIKE? WHO WERE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU  WANTED TO BE WHEN YOU WERE  YOUNGER. YOU'RE JUST SITTING HERE TALKING  TO COMEDIANS. IF YOU COULD PUT ANY COMEDIAN IN  THAT CAR WHO INFLUENCED YOU, WHO  WOULD IT BE?
ALMOST EVERY COMEDIAN I SAW  WHEN I WAS A KID INFLUENCED ME  JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, I GUESS MOST PEOPLE  DO, WHEN YOU SEE COMEDIANS ON TV  AND THEY COME OUT ON THESE SHOWS AND ANY STAND THERE AND THEY  JUST KEEP TALKING IN A SERIES OF  JOKES. AND I THOUGHT, WHAT IS THIS? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT CAN DO  THIS? AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE SOME  KIND OF, AS CHRIS SAYS, FREAKISH  PEOPLE THAT CAN JUST TALK IN A SERIES OF JOKES. BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO... IT'S A PROFESSION  THAT YOU LEARN HOW TO DO. IS ANY OF THIS NEWS?
Stephen: ALL OF IT. ALL OF IT IS NEWS TO ME. BUT YOU'RE YELLING IT AT ME, YOU  REALIZE. YOU'RE YELLING IT AT ME. YOU'RE DOMINATING ME RIGHT NOW. SEE, I'M BACK. YOU'RE FORWARD. YOU'RE YELLING THIS AT ME.
THAT IS STEP ONE. Stephen: IS THIS A DEFENSE  MECHANISM BECAUSE A LOT OF  PEOPLE USE ANGER OR JOKES AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM.
NO, I USE IT TO CONTROL  OTHERS.
Stephen: WHICH IS ANOTHER  FORM. TEHRANS DO THAT. TYRANTS ARE AFRAID OF THEIR OWN  PEOPLE. THEY CONTROL THEM BECAUSE  THEY'RE AFRAID OF BEING  OVERTHROWN.
BASICALLY STAND-UP IS A RALLY  IN AN EGYPTIAN SQUARE FOR MONEY.
Stephen: ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHO WERE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU  LIKED?
I LOVED ALAN KING, RICHARD  PRYOR. ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT AND STOOD  THERE AND JUST TALKD IN A SERIES  OF JOKES, I JUST THOUGHT WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO CAN DO THIS? COSBY. I LOVE COSBY.
Stephen: MY FAVORITE. VERY FUNNY FELLOW. BILL COSBY IS A VERY FUNNY  FELLOW, RIGHT.
COSBY AND CARLIN AND ROBERT  KLEIN.
Stephen: ARE YOU SATISFIED  WITH BEING JERRY SEINFELD?
WELL, IF I'M NOT, I'M GOING  TO NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP  BECAUSE THAT GUY...
Stephen: SOME OF THE  PERFORMERS, SOME PERFORMERS  AREN'T SATISFIED WITH BEING  THEMSELVES. THEY ALWAYS HAVE SOME SORT OF  NEED TO BE SOMETHING ELSE OR TO  PROVE THEMSELVES AS A PERFORMER.
WELL, I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,  THAT REALLY IS THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN COMEDIANS AND PEOPLE WHO PLAY OTHER PEOPLE. COME ON. STAY CALM.
Stephen: BUT YOU'RE LIKE THE  BIGGEST, YOU HAD THE BIGGEST  SHOW OF ALL TIME. IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT FOR YOU.
PLEASE, PLEASE, FINISH YOUR  THOUGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: I DON'T USUALLY  DRINK COFFEE WITH A GUEST.
COMEDIANS... Stephen: YOU KNOW NONE OF  THIS IS GOING ON THE AIR, RIGHT?
REALLY. Stephen: WE'RE LIKE AN HOUR  AND 15 AT THIS POINT. I'M ACTUALLY TAKING TIME FROM  YOUR SHOW ON THE INTERNET AT  THIS POINT. JERRY SEINFELD, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
MY PLEASURE. Stephen: COMEDIANS, CARS  GETTING COFFEE. THE MAN IS JERRY SEINFELD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
