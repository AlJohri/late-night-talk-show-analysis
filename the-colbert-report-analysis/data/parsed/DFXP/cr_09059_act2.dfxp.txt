Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING THE  BROADCAST ALREADY IN PROGRESS. AS YOU KNOW, POPE BENEDICT HAS  RESIGNED. THE QUESTION IS:  WHO IS GOING  TO GET THE NOD FOR THE TOP JOB? JOINING ME NOW CHAPLAIN OF THE  COLBERT NATION FATHER JIM  MARTIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FATHER JIM, WERE YOU SHOCKED  THIS MORNING WHEN YOU LEARNED  THE POPE WOULD BE RESIGNING?
I WAS. IT'S NOT UNEXPECTED BECAUSE HE  TALKED ABOUT IT SORT OF  OBLIQUELY BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WAS EXPECTING IT.
Stephen: IT'S COMPLETELY  UNEXPECTED. I TALK ABOUT RUNNING THE NEW  YORK CITY MAMPLET I'M NEVER  GOING TO DO IT. NO POPE HAS RESIGNED VOLUNTARILY  SINCE THE POPE IN 1294. THERE'S BARELY ANY TREES ON THE  PLANET WHO REMEMBER THIS. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? THERE IS NO TRADITION FOR THIS. WHAT HAPPENS?
NO THERE'S NOT. THERE'S A CONCLAVE, AN ELECTION  WHEN THE CARDINALS GATHER.
Stephen: THERE'S STILL  GOING TO BE A POPE WHEN THEY  ELECT A NEW ONE.
HE'S GOING TO RESIGN ON  FEBRUARY 28. THERE'S NO POPE, A VACANT SEAT  AND SOMEONE WILL TAKE OVER IN  HIS PLACE TEMPORARILY.
Stephen: WHO TAKES OVER? WHO IS MINI POPE FOR A WHILE? [LAUGHTER]
THE PERSON KNOWN AS THE  CHAMBERLAIN WILL TAKE OVER FOR A  BIT BUT THE POPE WILL APPARENTLY RETIRE AND WRITE BOOKS. I HEARD HE IS MOVING TO A  CONVENT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
Stephen: WOW. IS THAT CRICKET --
HE'S THE POPE HE CAN DO  WHATEVER HE WANTS.
Stephen: YOU HEARD ME GIVE  THE COLBERT BUMP TO CARDINAL  DOLAN. COULD THERE BE AN AMERICAN POPE?
I THINK IT'S VERY UNLIKELY  BUT IF THERE IS ONE IT WOULD BE  HIM BUTS UNLIKELY.
Stephen: WHY, AMERICA, WE  HAVE THE BEST CATHOLICS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DO. AMERICAN CATHOLICS.
SHOCKING OTHER PEOPLE DON'T  SEE THAT.
Stephen: REALLY?
CARDINALS THAT COME FROM  OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER PARTS  OF WORLD BRING THE SAME KIND OF BIASES THAT THEIR FELLOW  COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN WOULD HAVE  AND AMERICA IS NOT MOST POPULAR NATION WORLDWIDE.
Stephen: THERE'S ALMOST  NEVER A FIRST BALLOT POPE,  RIGHT?
IT'S UNUSUAL BUT THERE'S BEEN  SOME.
Stephen: CAN I TELL YOU THE  THEORY? I THINK ON THE FIRST BALLOT  EVERYBODY JUST VOTES FOR  THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW, ON THE OFF CHANCE THEY  GO LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE I'M  SO HUMBLE I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A GROUNDSWELL BEHIND ME. WE'LL SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. WHY NOT ME. WHY NOT? PEEKING OF WHICH, WHY NOT ME? I COULD BE POPE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IS IT POSSIBLE? [CROWD CHANTING SEE STEPHEN]
WHAT WOULD YOU CHOOSE AS YOUR  NAME BE IF YOU WERE POPE?
Stephen: I'M A BIG FAN OF  URBAN, I WOULD BE URBAN THE III.
NOT SUBURBAN.
Stephen: FATHER CHUCKLES,  ABSOLUTELY. IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S A PROBLEM TO  HAVE AN EX-POPE WHILE YOU'VE GOT  A PRESENT POPE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A VERY OPINIONATED EX-POPE. WHAT IF THE NEW POPE GETS ON THE  BALCONY THERE AND SAYS STUFF  THAT THE NEW POPE DOESN'T LIKE. SUDDENLY THE OLD POPE SHOWS UP  AND GOES, YOU'RE CRAZY. THEN YOU HAVE AN AVIGNON  SITUATION AGAIN.
YOU SEE SOMEONE IN BENEDICT  ABLE TO RELINQUISH THE RAINES OF  POWER. HERE IS SOMEONE FREE WITH THAT I  THINK IT'S PROBABLEITY LAST  THING HE WOULD DO.
Stephen: WE DON'T KNOW. IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN 700 YEARS.
YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: FATHER JIM THANK  YOU. HIS NEW E-BOOK IS TOGETHER ON
