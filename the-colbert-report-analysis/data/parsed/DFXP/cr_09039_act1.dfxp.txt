AVOIDS A FINANCIAL CRISIS. IN A RELATED STORY, CONGRESS  WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT  THE BENEFITS OF AMWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN BILL O'REILLY UNDER ATTACK  FROM THE P.C. POLICE. INSTEAD OF "PINHEADS AND  PATRIOTS," FROM NOW IT'S  PATRIOTS AND DIFFERENTLY SKULLED  AMERICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] MY GUEST JIMMY WALES IS THE  DRIVING FORCE BEHIND WIKIPEDIA. BIG DEAL, SO IS EVERYONE ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S 2013, SUCK IT MAYANS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE REPORT,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CROWD CHANTING STEPHEN] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STEPHEN: THANK YOU SO MUCH. EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE  BROADCAST. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. NATION, I AM BACK! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, I HAVEN'T SAT AT THIS DESK  FOR 24 DAYS. THAT IS 576 HOURS OR TWO  VIEWINGS OF LES MISERABLES. BY THE WAY, FOR THE RECORD I  THINK JAVERT IS GETTING A RAW  DEAL HERE. HE'S JUST A COP DOING HIS JOB. JEAN VALJEAN IS A CRIMINAL AND  MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. YOU'RE A THIEF! HOLLYWOOD SOFT ON CRIME. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, I SPENT EVERY MINUTE  OF THE BREAK WITH MY FAMILY. NOW, IT TURNS OUT -- [ LAUGHTER ] THEY ARE A LOVELY BUNCH OF  PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] GREAT COMPANY. I WISH THEM ALL THE BEST. SEE YOU IN THE SPRING. [ LAUGHTER ] AND, FOLKS, LIKE MANY AMERICANS,  OVER THE HOLIDAYS I TOOK CARE OF  A LOT OF THINGS I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF. THE FIRST SIX DAYS, I SPENT JUST  GOING TO THE BATHROOM. JUST TOO BUSY DURING THE  ELECTION. I ALSO WENT TO THE DOCTOR FOR A  FULL PHYSICAL. THAT AREA I WAS WORRIED ABOUT,  GOT SOME CREAM FOR IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THOSE ODD LITTLE GROWTHS,  APPARENTLY THOSE ARE TOES. DOC SAYS I NEED THEM. WHATEVER. HE'S THE ONE WITH THE FANCY  GROW. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT EVEN THOUGH I HAD MORE THAN  THREE WEEKS OFF, I'M HAPPY TO  SAY, DO NOT WORRY NATION, I AM NOT RUSTY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AM I RUSTY? I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT  RUSTY. RUSTY COLBERT? NO. I'LL GOING THAT FOR A SECOND. RUSTY COLBERT, OH, DO NOT GOOGLE  RUSTY COLBERT. THAT DOES LOOK LIKE ME. THAT'S ERASE THAT BROWSER  HISTORY WHILE WE'RE HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THAT'S MY NAME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, AND FOLKS,  I GET SUPER ANGRY OVER GAY  PENGUINS. [ LAUGHTER ] OR SUPER GAY OVER ANGRY  PENGUINS. I DON'T KNOW. OKAY. WE'LL SEE HOW THE YEAR SHAKES  OUT. OKAY. NOW, FOLKS, BEFORE I WENT ON  BREAK, ALL THE NEWS WAS ABOUT A  LOOMING ECONOMIC CATACLYSM KNOWN AS THE FISCAL CLIFF. I DIDN'T WATCH ANY NEWS OVER THE  BREAK BUT I ASSUME WE DID NOT  PLUNGE OVER THIS CLIFF BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SPENT THE LAST WEEK  FIGHTING SEAGULLS FOR DISCARDED  HOT DOG BUNS. AS A MEMBER OF THE TOP 1% I  WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD MY EYES  PECKED OUT BY AN ALBATROSS THAN SUFFER THE DEAL ACCEPTED BY  REPUBLICANS FROM OWE BALM YANCH  PRESIDENT OBAMA INCREASED TAXES ON THE RICH.
TAXES GO UP FOR SINGLES  MAKING OVER $400,000 OR MORE. IT GOES FROM 35% TO 39.6%.
39.6%, MR. PRESIDENT? HOW IS KIM-YE SUPPOSED TO AFFORD  A BABY NOW? NATION, NATION, LISTEN -- I  DON'T WANT TO BRAG -- BUT I MAKE  IN EXCESS OF 400 LARGE A YEAR AND BY LARGE I MEAN BIGGIE FRY,  BIGGIE COKE. OKAY? I'M SUCCESSFUL. IF THE GOVERNMENT PUNISHES ME  FOR IT WITH THE TAX INCREASE  MAYBE I WON'T WANT TO BE  ANYMORE.
IT LOWERS THE INCENTIVE OF  THE PEOPLE YOU WANT TO TAKE  RISKS AND TO INKNOW RATE IS AND TO CREATE.
IT'S A DISINCENTIVE TO WORK.
WHY DO WE WANT TO PUNISH  SUCCESS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD? WHY PUNISH SUCCESS? HOW CAN WE MAKERS CONTINUE TO  MAKE WHAT WE MAKE. WHY SCREEN A PERSONAL HUSBAND  AND WIFE OMELET TEAM? MARIA, UM BETTERO, I HAVE  TERRIBLE NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] THANK GOD THIS HORRIBLE DEAL HAS  LOOPHOLES.
INCLUDED IN THIS BILL WERE  TAX BREAKS FOR PORTO RICAN --  PUERTO RICAN RUM GROWINGS, ALGAE GROWERS CHNCH --
Stephen: WHICH IS WHY I'M  PROUD TO INTRODUCE CAPTAIN  COLBERT'S POND RUM. MMMMM, MMMMM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S THE ONLY CARIBBEAN SPIRIT  MADE WITH CHUNKS OF REAL ALLEGE  YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] -- ALGAE. LOOK FOR OUR CAR AT DAYTONA AND  OUR UPCOMING HOLLYWOOD HIT  "DRINK LIKE A FISH." FISCAL CONSERVATIVES MAY HAVE  LOST THIS ROUND AND GOD KNOWS  HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE BEFORE THERE'S A CLASH LIKE THIS OVER  THE BUDGET.
GOODBYE FISCAL CLIFF HELLO  DEBT CEILING.
THE FISCAL CLIFF FIGHT WAS  UGLY BUT WILL THE DEBT CEILING  STRUGGLE BE EVENINGING UGLIER.
HARD TO BELIEVE BUT THIS  COULD GET UGLIER. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GOVERNMENT IS AETCH  PERFECTING THE LEGAL LIMIT FOR  HOW MUCH KIT BORROW ALSO KNOWN AS THE DEBT CEILING. REPUBLICANS CAN DEMAND THAT THE  PRESIDENT MAKE SPENDING CUTS OR  WE'LL HIT THE DEBT CEILING AND GO THROUGH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] OR GET CRUSHED BY IT OR YOU KNOW  WHAT? WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE A SKYLIGHT  IN IT. SOUNDS NICE. IT'S PRETTY BUT THEY RARELY GET  CAULKED PROPERLY AND WHEN IT  RAINS, IT DRIPS AND RUINS YOUR SISAL CARPET. THE REPUBLICANS ARE CLEARLY IN A  STRONG POSITION BUT THE  PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE A TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE.
IS THERE A MAGIC BULLET TO  SOLVE THE CRISIS? TRY A MAGIC COIN. SOME ECONOMISTS, LEGAL SCHOLARS  AND A CONGRESSMAN ARE SUGGEST A  $1 TRILLION PLATINUM COIN COULD BE MINTED AND THE GOVERNMENT  COULD USE IT TO PAY THE DEBT,  AVOID DEFAULT AND PREEMPT THE DEBT CEILING CRISIS.
Stephen: WE SHOULD HAVE  KNOWN THAT A COIN WAS OBAMA'S  SOLUTION TO EVERYTHING. IT WAS RIGHT IN HIS SLOGAN. CHANGE. IT'S LEGAL IN THAT IT IS NOT  TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME EXPLAIN WITH SOMEONE  ELSE'S MOUTH.
TECHNICALLY IT DOES APPEAR TO  BE LEGAL. HERE IS HOW.
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PRINT  NEW MONEY BUT THERE'S A LIMIT TO  HOW MUCH PAPER MONEY CAN BE UNTIL CIRCULATION AT ANY ONE  TIME. THERE ARE RULES THAT LIMIT THE  DENOMINATIONS THAT GOLD, SILVER  AND COPPER COINS CAN BE BUT THERE'S NO LIMIT ON PLATINUM  COINS. THE PRESIDENT CAN ISSUE A  PLATINUM COIN IN ANY  DENOMINATION. THE TREASURY CAN MINT IT AND  PRINT ON IT $1 TRILLION. IT PRESIDENT CAN ORDER IT TO BE  DEPOSITED AT THE FEDERAL  RESERVE.
Stephen: THEN BEN BERNANKE  GOES TO THE FED BREAK ROOM  VENDING MACHINE, INSERTS THE COUNT AND PICKS EITHER CHEESE  NIPS OR SAVE THE WORLD ECONOMY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS -- FRANKLY, I DO NOT THINK  THIS WILL EVER HASM FIRST OF  ALL, WHEN -- EVER HAPPEN. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT DO YOU PUT ON  A TRILLION DOLLAR COIN SNON THE  TAIL SIDE A BALD EAGLE BREATHING FIRE WHILE MAKING LOVE TO THEN  AMERICAN FLAG. WHAT IS ON THE SNEAD OBAMA? BOEHNER? I'LL TELL WHAT YOU IT SHOULD BE  THE CHARMIN BEARS BECAUSE WHEN  YOU PULL AN IDEA LIKE THIS OUT OF YOUR ASS, YOU'RE GOING TO  NEED SOMETHING SOFT. [ LAUGHTER ] BESIDES, IT DOESN'T MATTER, ALL  OF THIS MEANS NOTHING BECAUSE A  ONE TRILLION DOLLAR COIN DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. OUR NATION'S DEBT IS $16  TRILLION. WE CAN'T MAKE A $16 TRILLION  COIN. THAT'S JUST SILLY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
