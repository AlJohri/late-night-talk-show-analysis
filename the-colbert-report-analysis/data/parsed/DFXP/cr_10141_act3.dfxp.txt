(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYED YOUNG MAGNETO IN THE X-MEN MOVIES. I'LL DEFEAT HIM WITH MY SUPERPOWER:  FINAL EDIT OF THE SHOW PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL FASSBENDER. MICHAEL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING, GOOD TO SEE YOU THANKS FOR COMING ON. I'M A BIG FAN, OBVIOUSLY THE AUDIENCE IS TOO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW OSCAR NOMINATED ACTOR SOME OF YOUR FILMS INCLUDE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, SHAME, 12 YEARS A SLAVE, X-MEN MOVIES. YOUR NEW FILM "FRANK" OPENS IN SELECT CITIES AUGUST 15th AND NATIONWIDE AUGUST 29th. HOW MUCH OF THIS MOVIE IS MUTANT ROBO NAZI HUNTING. TELL THE GOOD PEOPLE WHAT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT.
BASICALLY IT'S ABOUT THIS CHARACTER JOHN PLAYED BY DONALD GLEASON WHO GETS INTRODUCED TO THIS BAND WHICH IS A VERY SORT OF AVANT-GARDE SORT OF MISFIT GROUP OF PEOPLE PLAYING MUSIC WITH VARIOUS THINGS FROM A TOOTHBRUSH TO A STRAW TO A PIECE OF CORRUGATED IRON. JOHN IS A VERY AMBITIOUS BUT LACKING IN TALENT IN TERMS OF A MUSICIAN.
Stephen: I HAVE MET HIM.
YES, BACK THERE. AND THE REST OF THE BAND ARE TALENTED BUT WITHOUT AMBITION. AND IT IS SORT OF HOW THESE TWO JOURNEYS TAKE OFF.
Stephen: AND IN COMES FRANK WHO --
HE HAS SOMETHING NONE OF THEM HAVE WHICH IS A GIANT PAPIER MACHE HEAD.
YES.
Stephen: LET'S SHOW THE PEOPLE WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXPLAINING.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING.
SURE.
WHY DO YOU WEAR THAT?
YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD?
KIND OF.
WELL, NORMAL FACES ARE WEIRD TOO, SO THE WAY THEY'RE SMOOTH, SMOOTH, SMOOTH, AND THEN-- BLAH, YOU KNOW, ALL BUMPY AND HOLES. I MEAN WHAT ARE EYES LIKE, LIKE A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE, DON'T GET ME STARTED ON LIPS. LIKE THE EDGES OF A VERY SERIOUS WOUND.
THAT'S TRUE AM BUT YOUR HEAD IS STILL SORT OF INTIMIDATING.
WELL UNDERNEATH IT I'M GIVING YOU A WELCOMING SMILE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT DOES IT-- LIKE 98% OF THE MOVIE YOU'VE GOT THAT ON YOUR HEAD.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY. WAS THAT LIBERATING OR WAS THAT CONFINING AS AN ACTOR? WHAT DO YOU GET FROM THAT? THAT'S BETTER THAN NOT SEEING THAT FACE.
WELL, YOU GET TO LIE IN THE MORNING,  LET THE STAND-IN GO IN, TAKE MANY DAYS OFF  REALLY BECAUSE I'M UNDER THE HEAD FOR MOST OF IT AND JUST HAD TO COME IN FOR THE LAST SCENE.
Stephen: OSCAR WILDE SAID IF YOU WANT TO GET THE TRUTH FROM A MAN GIVE HIM A MASK.
YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, SO WHAT TRUTH CAN YOU AS AN ACTOR TELL WITH A MASK THAT YOU CAN'T TELL WITH YOUR FACE?
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
Stephen: THANK YOU, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO ON, I GUESS. I LIKE HEARING YOU SAY THAT I MADE A GOOD POINT.
I MEAN-- FOR ME I WANTED-- I WANTED TO TAKE THE HEAD WITH ME AND DO ALL JOBS WITH THE HEAD. IT IS VERY SORT OF LIBERATING, I SUPPOSE, IF YOU'VE GONE TO YOU KNOW, HALLOWEEN OR A FANCY DRESS PARTY OR ANYTHING AND YOU WEAR A MASK, IT'S QUITE LIBERATING BECAUSE YOU FEEL KIND OF INVINCIBLE. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
Stephen: DO YOU GO TO FANCY DRESS PARTIES WITH A MASK ON.
I'D LIKE TO.
Stephen: THAT'S KIND OF AN EYES WIDE SHUT SITUATION. NICE. CAN YOU HOOK A BROTHER UP WHILE YOU'RE IN TOWN.
THERE'S ONE TONIGHT.
Stephen: REALLY, OUT ON LONG ISLAND? SEND ME AN INVITATION. DID YOU WANT TO BE A MUSICIAN. YOU ARE AN ACTOR. YOU GET TO BE A MUSICIAN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A BAND. YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO PLAY HERE IN A SECOND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S INCREDIBLE TOO, THE BAND, AT'S NOT JUST ANY BAND, IT'S MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL,-- I MEAN DO ALL ACTORS SECRETLY WANT TO BE MUSICIANS THE WAY MUSICIANS ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BE HIGH? (LAUGHTER)
I THINK SO.
Stephen: DID YOU WANT TO BE A MUSICIAN.
I WANT TO BE HIGH. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL-- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, STICK AROUND, DO THE SONG AND TAKE US HIGHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE MOVIE IS "FRANK" MICHAEL FASSBENDER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A PERFORMANCE BY SORONPRFBS. STICK AROUND, THANK YOU.
