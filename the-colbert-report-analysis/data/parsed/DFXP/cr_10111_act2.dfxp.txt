(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST TUNING INTO "THE COLBERT REPORT" TONIGHT I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT YES, YES, THIS IS HAPPENING. (LAUGHTER) AND I GREW IT SPECIFICALLY TO GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH TONIGHT'S GUEST FRENCH ECONOMIST AND PROFESSOR WHO SEDUCES YOUR GIRLFRIEND DURING HER SEMESTER ABROAD. THOMAS PIKETTY. THIS FRENCH-FRIED FRAUD IS ATTACK OUR WAY OF LIFE FROM ATOP THE BEST-SELLER LIST. THE NUMBER ONE BEST SELLING BOOK ON AMAZON RIGHT NOW, A 700 PAGE TOME PACKED WITH TERMS LIKE DISEQUALIBRIA  AND RICARDIAN. THE BOOK HAS ALREADY SOLD ABOUT 85,000 COPIES INCLUDING eBOOKS AND THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS HAS ORDERS ON HAND FOR ANOTHER 90,000. AND EVERY ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT.
THIS BOOK IS LIKE THE HARRY POTTER OF ECONOMIC POLICY.
WHOA.
IT'S TRUE. IN FACT, THE FULL TITLE IS CAPITOL IN THE 21st CENTURY HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY BORING. (LAUGHTER) IT'S YOUR CLASSIC BREEZY 700 PAGE HEAVILY APPENDIXED BEACH READ. BUT ANALYZES OVER 200 YEARS OF ECONOMIC DATA FROM 20 COUNTRIES. AND THE BIG TAKE AWAY, FOLKS IS THAT THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM HAS A NATURAL TENDENCY TOWARDS INCREASING THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH BECAUSE THE RATE OF RETURN ON PROPERTY AND INVESTMENTS HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN HIGHER THAN THE RATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, G. WHICH HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE CATCHY FORMULA R IS GREATER THAN G. (LAUGHTER) YOU'VE SEEN IT ON ALL THE T-SHIRTS. OR YOU WILL BECAUSE I'M NOW SELLING THESE T-SHIRTS ON MY WEBSITE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE ALL PROCEEDS GOES TO ME SO I CAN PROVE THAT THIS IS TRUE. AND FOLKS, THIS FORMULA IS NOTHING NEW. REMEMBER THE OLD SAYING THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR SHOULD REALLY TRY BEING RICH. IT'S NICE. (LAUGHTER) AND HERE'S MY MAJOR BONE TO PIKETTY WITH TOM. HE THINKS WE NEED A PROGRESSIVE GLOBAL TAX ON CAPITAL THAT COULD SKYROCKET TO A PUNITIVE 80% TAX RATE ON INCOMES ABOVE 500,000 DOLLARS. 80%. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF -- -- 80%. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF -- -- 80%. THAT'S AN INCREASE OF -- -- 80% MORE THAN I PAY NOW.
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT FROM THIS  PEPE LE PUNITIVE TAX RATE HERE. AND HERE'S WHERE THIS COMES IN. OKAY? YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING. I GREW THIS IN SOLIDARITY MY PERSONAL FRIEND BILLIONAIRE INDUSTRIALIST TONY STARK. SEE, IF PIKETTY HAD HIS WAY AND TONY WAS COUGHING UP 80% TAXES, HE IS NOT A BILLIONAIRE ANY MORE AND CAN'T AFFORD TO BE IRONMAN THEN WHO IS SAVING NEW YORK FROM THE INVADERS, HAWKEYE, YEAH, AFTER HE GETS THERE ON THE BUS. BILLIONAIRES, BILLIONAIRES, BILLIONAIRES PROTECT US. AND TONIGHT I PROTECT THEM. I GOT YOUR BACK, TONY. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WE RETURN I WILL SIT DOWN WITH FRENCH ECONOMIST THOMAS PIKETTY SO I CAN GIVE HIM A PIECE OF MY MIND WHILE DENYING HIM A PIECE OF MY WEALTH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
