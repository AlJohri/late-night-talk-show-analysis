Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE TO TALK ABOUT RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. PLEASE WELCOME JULIA IOFFE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JULIA IOFFE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU ARE A SENIOR EDITOR AT THE NEW REPUBLIC AND YOU'VE WORKED AS A MOSCOW CORRESPONDENT FOR THE "NEW YORKER." YOU'RE A NATIVE RUSSIAN EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, CAME HERE WHEN YOU WERE SEVEN.
MM-HMM.
Stephen: WE ARE TALKING A LOT THESE DAYS ABOUT THE UKRAINE AND RUSSIA AND THAT RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE STORY AND I CARE ABOUT IT. WHY IS IT HUGE AND WHY DO I CARE IN WAYS I NEVER CARE ABOUT OTHER INTERNATIONAL STORIES. I CAN IGNORE THE REST OF THE WORLD. WHY HAS THIS GOT US ALL GRIPPED?
PEOPLE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THIS CONFLICT VERY MUCH AT ALL. IT HAD COME OFF THE FRONT PAGES FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO IT UNTIL A PLANE WITH CITIZENS OF LIKE A DOZEN COUNTRIES WAS DOWNED BY A MISSILE BY THESE KNUCKLEHEADS FIGHTING IN THE REGION.
Stephen: IS THAT A TECHNICAL TERM?
THAT'S CORRECT. IT'S AN I.R. TERM.
Stephen: YOU HAVE SPENT TIME WITH THESE RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS IN THE UKRAINE.
THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE VOLUNTEERS. THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF DONETSK, BUT THE SOLDIERS ARE CALLED VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM JUST PICKED UP ARMS AND WENT TO FIGHT BECAUSE THEY  WATCH A LOT OF RUSSIAN TV.
Stephen: OKAY. AND RUSSIAN TV HAS, LIKE, THE SHOWS LIKE "WHO WANTS TO BE A REBEL"? WHAT'S ON RUSSIAN TV THAT MAKES PEOPLE WANT TO FIGHT AGAINST THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN?
FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS, SINCE FEBRUARY, RUSSIAN TV HAS BEEN TELLING THEM A FASCIST HAS TAKEN POWER IN KIEV, COMING TO RAPE WOMEN, EAT THEIR CHILDREN AND BURN THEIR LAND, SO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCARED, PICKING UP ARMS AND GOING TO FIGHT.
Stephen: IS THAT WHAT THE EVENING NEWS IS LIKE IN RUSSIA? IS THERE A FREE PRESS IN RUSSIA?
NO, THERE ISN'T. MOST RUSSIANS GET THEIR NEWS FROM THE TV AND IT IS MOSTLY OUTRIGHT OWNED BY THE KREMLIN OR COMPANIES WHO ARE LOYAL TO THE KREMLIN. SO THE HEADS OF THE MAJOR TV CHANNELS COME TO THE KREMLIN ONCE A WEEK AND MEET WITH A GUY IN CHARGE OF TV AT THE KREMLIN AND THEY SET THE AGENDA FOR THE COMING WEEK.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU MET WITH IGOR BEZLER, NICKNAMED THE DEMON. IS HE A GOOD GUY?
VERY SWEET (LAUGHTER) HE'S ACTUALLY A BIT OF A LOOSE CANNON, VERY MERCURIAL
Stephen: IS HE ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS?
HE'S ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE VOLUNTEERS. HE'S NOT EVEN A UKRAINIAN CITIZEN, SO IT'S WEIRD HE'S FIGHTING FOR THIS UKRAINIAN MOVEMENT, FOR UKRAINE TO SECEDE AND JOIN RUSSIA. HE'S A RUSSIAN CITIZEN HE WAS BORN IN SOVIET CRIMEA.
Stephen: HE'S ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THIS GROUP WHO'S TRYING TO BREAK AWAY.
MM-HMM.
Stephen: IN DONETSK? AM I PRONOUNCING THAT RIGHT?
MM-HMM.
Stephen: IS THAT RUSSIAN FOR "LITTLE DOUGHNUT"?
NO, I THINK BECAUSE OF THE RIVER IT'S CALLED THAT.
Stephen: OKAY. (LAUGHTER) IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THIS BEZLER IS ONE OF THE GUYS WHO THE UKRAINIANS SAY THEY HAVE A RECORDING SAYING "WE JUST SHOT DOWN A PLANE."
UH-HUH.
Stephen: IS HE UPSET OR HAPPY THEY SHOT DOWN A PLANE.
HE'S A LITTLE FLUSTERED. HE SWEARS A LOT AND SAID, MAN, SERIOUSLY, THIS IS 100% A CIVILIAN PLANE. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HIS HANDLER IN RUSSIA IS SAYING, OH, THEY MUST HAVE JUST BEEN DROPPING OFF THEIR SPIES.
Stephen: OKAY. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES IN RUSSIA AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH THIS PLANE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CRAZIER ONES?
MY FAVORITE IS MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 17 IS ACTUALLY MALAYSIA AIRLINES 370 WHICH AS WE KNOW DISAPPEARED OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN FOUR MONTHS AGO AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS IT DIDN'T FALL INTO THE INDIAN OCEAN. THE AMERICANS TOOK IT, KILLED EVERYONE ON BOARD, DRAINED THEM OF THEIR BLOOD AND TOOK THE PLANE AND ALL THE CORPSES TO AN AMERICAN MILITARY BASE, SHUTTLED IT TO HOLLAND, RIGGED IT WITH EXPLOSIVES -- IT'S VERY SIMPLE -- (LAUGHTER) -- AND BECAUSE TAKEOFF IS COMPLICATED, THEY HAD LIVE PILOTS DOING THE TAKEOFF, THEN THEY PARACHUTE OUT. FIRST THEY PUT IT ON AUTO PILOT, PARACHUTE OUT AND THE PLANE EXPLODES WHEN NECESSARY OVER EASTERN UKRAINE.
Stephen: THAT'S A PLOT FROM SHERLOCK, THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SHERLOCK THE SERIES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: IS PUTIN GOING TO BE HARMED BY THIS? BECAUSE WE'RE IMPOSING MORE SANCTIONS, SUPPOSEDLY. WE'RE DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND OR AT LEAST A LINE IN THE CASH. IS HE GOING TO CARE?
HE'S GOING TO CARE A LITTLE BIT, BUT HE SEES HIMSELF AS AN HISTORICAL FIGURE THAT IS MEANT TO KIND OF RESURRECT RUSSIA, BRING BACK ITS GREATNESS, SO HE'S WILLING TO TOLERATE ECONOMIC PAIN TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS.
Stephen: IS THIS NEO-SOVIET? IS IT NEO-CSARIST? ARE THEY TRYING TO RECONSTITUTE THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AND IF SO SHOULD WE THROW BACK IN WITH THE AUSTRIAN HUNGARIANS AND GIVE INDIA BACK TO THE BRITISH?
HE'S NOT VERY GOOD AT THINKING LONG TERM SO HE TAKES A LITTLE BIT FROM THIS AND THAT PLAY BOOK, SO, ACTUALLY, WHEN THE RUSSIANS TOOK CRIMEA AND THE WEST WAS ALL UP IN ARMS ABOUT IT -- WELL, NOT UP IN ARMS, THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING -- THEY WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT IT --
Stephen: METAPHORICALLY UP IN ARMS.
THAT'S RIGHT. ONE OF THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTERS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SAID, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GET A TOEHOLD ON THE MOON AND START COLONIZING THE MOON BECAUSE THE RUSSIANS ARE WILLING TO SUFFER FOR A GREAT IDEA.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO COLONIZE THE MOON? DO YOU THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN?
NO, I THINK THEY WOULD MESS IT UP ALONG THE WAY.
Stephen: REALLY? YEAH.
Stephen: IT WOULD MAKE IT SO MUCH LESS ROMANTIC TO STAND UNDERNEATH THE RUSSIAN MOON... (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE MADE OF GREEN CHEESE, IT WOULD BE MADE OF BORSCHT. (LAUGHTER) THANKS FOR JOINING ME! JULIA IOFFE, THE NEW REPUBLIC! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
