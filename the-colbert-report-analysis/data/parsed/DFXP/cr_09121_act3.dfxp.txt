MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE  OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE NEW  IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL. I'LL ASK HOW HE GOT PAST MY  BORDER FENCE. PLEASE WELCOME VIA SATELLITE  CHUCK SCHUMER. SIR, WELCOME TO THE REPORT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW CHARLES SCHUMER OR  SHOULD I CALL UCAR LOSS  SCHUM-- CARLOS SCHUMER.
CHARLES IS GOOD.
FOR NOW, BECAUSE WE ARE  TAPING THIS AT 2:00 IN THE  AFTERNOON. AND YOU ARE VOTING ON THE  IMMIGRATION BILL AROUND WHAT  TIME?
ABOUT 4:00.
OKAY, 4:00 AND I'M  SHOWING THIS TO MY STUDIO  AUDIENCE AT 7:30 BUT WE'RE NOT BROADCASTING IT UNTIL  11:30, SO THANK YOU FOR  STAYING UP LATE WITH ME  TONIGHT TO PRETAPE THIS LOOK BACK AT WHAT HADN'T YET  TRANSPIRED IN THE SENATE  LATER THIS AFTERNOON EARLIER  TODAY. SO WHAT WILL HAVE HAD  HAPPENED?
WELL, I BELIEVE THAT THIS  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  BILL WILL HAVE PASSED BY A VERY LARGE VOTE, TWO-THIRDS  OF THE SENATE WILL VOTE FOR  IT, ALMOST EVERY DEMOCRAT, PROBABLY EVERY DEMOCRAT, AND  A LARGE NUMBER OF  REPUBLICANS. AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT  A LARGE NUMBER OF  REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR THE  BILL.
BY THE TIME THIS AIRS  WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OF HOW  MANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL HAVE BEEN GRANTED AMNESTY  AND VOTED FOR A DEMOCRAT?
WELL, NONE YET. BUT YOU KNOW, THE BILL DOES  PROVIDE A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP BECAUSE IT'S --
IT'S AMNESTY.
WELL, THEY HAVE TO WORK  HARD AND THEY HAVE TO LEARN  ENGLISH.
IT'S SHAMNESTY, IT'S A  SLICE OF HAMNESTY, IT'S  RASPBERRY JAMMESTY, IT'S WHAM, BAM, THANK YOU  AMNESTY. I'VE GOT A RHYMING  DICTIONARY AND I AM NOT  AFRAID TO USE IT.
IT'S GO TOKAI GOOD BILL  FOR AMERICA, STEPHEN.
Stephen: ARE YOU ARE  SURPRISE THAUD ONLY GOT 68  VOTES IN.
NO I THINK WE'RE REALLY  PLEASED WITH THE NUMBER OF  VOTES WE'VE GOTTEN RZ.
Stephen: ISN'T THIS A  PLOY FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO  GET VOTE, ISN'T THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE DOING  THIS?
WELL, NO, THE BOTTOM LINE  IS THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS  ONE OF THE BEST THING QUESTIONS DO FOR AMERICA.
Stephen: SO WHY DON'T YOU  JUST PROVE THIS ISN'T ABOUT  VOTES BY SAYING RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE  LATINO VOTE.
WELL, I WANT  EVERYBODY-- .
Stephen: GO AWAY, LATINOS,  SAY IT, DON'T VOTE FOR ME,  ME CHUCK SCHUMER.
I WANT TO GET EVERY VOTE  OF CAN OF EVERYBODY, THAT'S  FOR SURE. BUT I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE I  BELIEVE IN AMERICA, I REALLY  DO. AND IMMIGRATION HAS ALWAYS  BEEN PART OF THE AMERICAN  FABRIC.
Stephen: SIR NO ONE LOVES  LATINOS MORE THAN I DO. THEY ARE A NATURALLY  CONSERVATIVE GROUP THAT  VALUES FAITH AND FAMILY. I JUST DON'T WANT ANY MORE  OF THEM COMING IN. I WANT THE TIME TO REALLY  APPRECIATE THE ONES WE  ALREADY HAVE.
WELL, LISTEN, EVERY  IMMIGRANT GROUP THAT COMES,  WHEN THEY LEAVE THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND THEY, YOU KNOW,  THEY RISK THEIR LIVES OFTEN  TIMES TO COME, THAT'S BEEN TRUE THROUGH THE CENTURIES,  COME TO A NEW CULTURE,  THEY'RE REALLY HARD-WORKING  DEDICATED PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST SEEKING A BETTER LIFE  IN AMERICA HAS ALWAYS  AFFORDED THEM THAT BETTER  LIFE.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET  SO MANY GOP SENATORS AND  GUYS LIKE BILL O REILLY TO CAVE ON THIS ONE?
I THINK THEY'RE DOING  WHAT THEY THINK IS GOOD FOR  THE COUNTRY DESPITE SOME REAL POLITICAL ADVERSITY.
WHAT DID YOU GIVE THEM. WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THE BILL  TO SWEETEN IT FOR  REPUBLICANS.
THERE ARE LOTS OF  SPECIFICATION PROVISION  NOTICE BILL THAT HELP PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT STATES BUT  NASS'S GOOD TOO. BECAUSE IN MANY INDUSTRIES  WE DEPEND ON IMMIGRANTS TO  MAKE THE INDUSTRIES GROWMENT YOU TAKE AGRICULTURE. VERY FEW AMERICANS WILL PICK  THE CROPS. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD  SUPPLY OF IMMIGRANTS, THEN  YOU WON'T-- THEN YOU WON'T HAVE A BIG GOOD FARMING  INDUSTRY AND FOOD GROWN HERE  IN AMERICA.
Stephen: IS IT THE EASIER  ANSWER JUST TO STOP EATING  VEGETABLES? MANY AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY  TAKEN THAT PATH.
I LIKE BROCCOLI.
Stephen: WHEN JOHN McCAIN  WAS RUNNING FOR THE SENATE  THE LAST TIME, EVERYBODY MADE FUN OF HIM FOR HAVING  AN AD WHERE YOU SAID BUILD  THE DANG FENCEMENT BUT  NOW-- NOW YOU'RE BUILDING IT, IS THIS THE DANG FENCE? AND HOW DANG IS IT?
WELL, IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH  FENCE. AND IT'S NOT JUST A FENCE. WE USE ALL KINDS OF DEVICES,  LISTENING DEVIALSES THAT CAN  FIND WHEN PEOPLE CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY IN THE  FUTURE. AND THEY CAN BE APPREHENDED  AND TURNED BACK. IT'S MUCH TOUGHER AND MUCH  STRONGER USING A LOT OF THE  NEW TECHNOLOGY THAN THE  PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS.
Stephen: WILL THERE BE  MORE LISTENING DEVICES ON  THE MEXICAN BORDER OR IN AMERICANS TELEPHONES THAT  THE NSA IS LISTENING IN ON.
IF WE HAVE OUR WAY, MORE  ON THE BORDER.
Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT  THE GANG OF EIGHT. YOU'RE THE LEADER OF THE  GANG OF EIGHT, AREN'T NEW.
I GUESS JOHN McCAIN AND I  HAVE BEEN CALLED THE TWO  LEADERS OF IT, YES.
Stephen: ARE THERE OTHER  GANGS ON THE SENATE FLOOR  LIKE CRYPTS OR BLOODS? IF YOU THROW THE WRONG GANG  SIGN COULD JOHN CORNI CUT A  BITCH.
NO, THESE GANGS ARE  CONSTRUCTIVE GANGS. WE'RE TRYING TO GET  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO  COME TOGETHER AND DO SOME  GOOD THINGS AND IF THE MORE GANGS WE WOULD BE A BETTER  PLACE.
Stephen: WILL SENATOR  MARCO RUBIO ULTIMATELY VOTE  FOR THE BILL THAT MARCO RUBIO WROTE? OR WILL MARCO RUBIO HAVE TO  MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS TO THE  EXTREME MARCO RUBIO WING OF MARCO RUBIO IN ORDER TO GET  RUBIO'S VOTE?
HE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB,  HE REALLY HAS. AND HE HAS TAKEN A LOT OF  ARROWS BUT HE BELIEVES IN  THIS AND HE'S DOING THE  RIGHT THING. I THINK THE WORLD OF HIM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF  GANG TATTOOS? DOW GET LIKE A TEAR TAT ON  YOUR FACE FOR EVERY BILL YOU  PASS?
WE'RE TO THE GOING SHOW  YOU OUR TATTOOS.
Stephen: WAS'S GOING TO  HAPPEN TO THIS BILL WHEN IT  GETS TO THE HOUSE.
I THINK THERE WILL BE A  LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE HOUSE  TO ACTUALLY GET THE BILL  DONE. I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF  CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN WAS  DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR IT,  FINE. PUT IT ON THE FLOOR OF THE  HOUSE AND LET THE DEMOCRATS  PASS IT WITH SOME  REPUBLICANS. AND AMERICA WILL BE A BETTER  PLACE, SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT'S  WHAT SPEAKER BOEHNER WILL EVENTUALLY DO.
Stephen: HERE'S WHAT MY  FELLOW CONSERVATIVES DON'T  TRUST ABOUT YOU DEMOCRATS. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS  BEFORE. YOU TALK BIG ON SECURITY. AND THEN LIKE LUCY YOU YANK  AWAY THE BALL RIGHT AS  CHARLIE BROWN TRIES TO KICK  TELEPHONE. AND WORST OF ALL IT'S NOT A  FOOTBALL, IT'S A FUTOBALL.
WELL, THAT'S THE KIND OF  TRIGGER WE DO HAVE IN THE  BILL. IN OTHER WORDS, THE SECURITY  MECHANISMS AS WELL AS THE  MECHANISMS THAT PREVENT  ILLEGALS FROM FUTILE LEGALS FROM GETTING JOBS, ALL OF  THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE IN  PLACE BEFORE PEOPLE CAN  BECOME LEGALIZED AND WORK, THOSE 11 MILLION. BUT THEY CAN'T GET THEIR  GREEN CARD UNTIL THOSE  THINGS ARE ACTUALLY IN  PLACE.
Stephen: LAST QUESTION,  SENATOR, THE SENATE SEEMS TO  BE MARGINALLY MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES THESE DAYS. WHEN YOU WORK SO HARD AND  FOR SO LONG ON LEGISLATION  IN THE SENATE, AND THEN SEND IT OVER TO THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, DOES THAT  EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE  NUDGING YOUR FULLY GROWN CHILD INTO A FIELD FULL OF  BEAR TRAPS?
WELL, WE'RE HOPEFUL THE  HOUSE WILL RISE TO THE  OCCASION. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO  DO AS WE'VE SHOWN. IT'S NOT A DEMOCRATIC BILL,  IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL. IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR  AMERICA, HAS SUPPORT FROM  ACROSS THE POLITICAL  SPECTRUM. A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE  AS YOU MENTIONED BILL  O'REILLY AND OTHERS SUPPORT  IT. SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THE HOUSE  WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION. IF I HAD TO BET MONEY, THEY  WILL.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING ME, SENATOR. SENATOR, CARLOS SCHUMER,  EVERYBODY.
NICE TO BE WITH YOU,  STEPHEN.
