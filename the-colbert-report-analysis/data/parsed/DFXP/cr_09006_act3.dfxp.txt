(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  SINGER/SONGWRITER KNOWN FOR HIS  MELANCHOLY LYRICS. ARE YOU READY TO ROCK YOURSELF  BACK AND FORTH IN THE SHOWER  WHILE CRYING? (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME MORRISSEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON! ALL RIGHT! THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU'RE -- YOU'RE LIKE A LIVING  LEGEND OF INDY ROCK, REDEFINED  THE BRITISH SOUND, LAST 25 YEARS  --
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD  "LEGEND" MEANS?
Stephen: IT MEANS YOU'RE  DEAD?
NO, IT'S SOMETHING THAT MIGHT  BE TRUE OR MIGHT BE FALSE. IT DOESN'T REALLY APPLY. BUT THANK YOU.
Stephen: WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT  BE THAT GOOD. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S POSSIBLE. IS HE THAT GOOD? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL RIGHT. THERE IT IS. COLBERT NATION HAS VOTED. YOU'RE FROM ENGLAND. DID YOU ENJOY THE QUEEN'S  JUBILEE? IT WAS SUCH A LOVELY  CELEBRATION!
A CELEBRATION OF WHAT? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: 60 YEARS OF MAJESTY!
60 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP!
Stephen: DICTATORSHIP? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S DICTATORSHIP.
Stephen: IT'S -- IT'S A  MONARCHY IN NAME BUT IT'S REALLY  JUST A TOURIST TRAP AT THIS  POINT. (LAUGHTER)
VERY, VERY TRUE.
Stephen: DIDN'T YOU LOVE THE  PAGEANTRY?
NO.
Stephen: NO?
SORRY, NO.
Stephen: BUT -- BUT SHE'S  YOUR QUEEN.
SHE'S NOT!
Stephen: YES! SHE IS! YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT BUT SHE'S  YOUR QUEEN. YOU HAD TO LOVE THE ROYAL  WEDDING?
I HATED THE ROYAL WEDDING.
Stephen: YOU HAD TO LOVE IT.
I HATED IT.
Stephen: KATE THE GREAT!
I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY  HORRIBLE PEOPLE. I THINK THEY'RE ARROGANT  HORRIBLE DICTATORS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THEY'RE HORRIBLE. THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED THEM.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  SAY PIPPA DIDN'T LOOK LOVELY. (LAUGHTER)  YOU COULDN'T HAVE PULLED OFF  THAT DRESS. (LAUGHTER)
THEN OF COURSE A FEW WEEKS  LATER SHE'S IN A SCANDAL IN  PARIS, HIDING COMPLETELY.
Stephen: OF COURSE, THEY HAVE  TO KEEP THE MAJESTY GOING.
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE A ROYAL  FAMILY?
Stephen: UM, YES, CALLED THE  ROMNEYS. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THIS IS THE SMITHS, RIGHT?
HE'S NOT SATISFIED.
Stephen: NO, I'M NEVER  SATISFIED. IT'S MY JOB AS A JOURNALIST TO  FIND OUT WHY YOU WON'T GET BACK  TOGETHER. OKAY? WITH JOHNMY MAR. WHY NOT? YOU GUYS COULD CASH IN HUGE!
NOT EVERYBODY'S A FAT OLD  SLAG. (LAUGHTER)  NOT EVERYBODY IS.
Stephen: WELL, I HATE TO TELL  YOU, PLEASE WELCOME JOHNNY MAR. JOHNNY? (LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHS)
Stephen: NOT EVEN FOR A  MINUTE? NOT EVEN A MINUTE?
WELL, IT WAS QUITE FUNNY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU'RE A RENOWNED  VEGETARIAN, YOU'RE KIND OF  MILITANT ABOUT IT. YOU REQUESTED-- DEMANDED-- THAT  THIS BUILDING, EVERYONE ON  STAFF, THIS THIS BE A MEAT-FREE  ENVIRONMENT FOR THE DAY THAT YOU ARE HERE.
YES.
Stephen: SO IF I'M WOOZY  RIGHT NOW IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T  HAD MY BACON. (LAUGHTER)  WHY? WHY ARE YOU SO MILITANT ABOUT  NOT ONLY, LIKE, NOT -- NOT YOU  HAVING MEAT BUT NOT EVEN SEEING  MEAT?
BECAUSE ANIMALS ARE NICER  THAN HUMANS AND THEY'RE  CONSCIOUS BEINGS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: REALLY.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ANIMALS  THAT EAT OTHER ANIMALS? CAN I EAT A LION?
ONLY WHEN THEY HAVE TO.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT ONE  THAT'S ALREADY DEAD. LIKE A COW THAT'S BEEN SENTENCED  TO DEATH FOR A MURDER? (LAUGHTER)  OR A PIG THAT COMMITS SUICIDE  FROM LISTENING TO TOO MANY OF  YOUR SONGS? (LAUGHTER)
YOU SHOULDN'T LAUGH AT THAT.
Stephen: I KNOW A LAMB THAT'S  A (BLEEP)ING ASS (BLEEP). CAN I EAT THAT LAMB? CAN I EAT THAT LAMB? (LAUGHTER)
IF YOU SPIT YOUR GRANDMOTHER  IN AN OVEN SHE WILL PROBABLY BE  TASTY. BUT IS THAT ANY REASON TO EAT  YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
Stephen: THAT REMINDS ME, YOU  HAVE AN ALBUM AND A SONG "MEAT  IS MURDER."  HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF  SAYING THAT? BECAUSE WHEN I HEAR THAT I JUST  THINK "MURDER IS DELICIOUS."  (LAUGHTER)
BUT -- BUT -- TO A REALLY  INTELLIGENT BEING MURDER IS NOT  DELICIOUS. (LAUGHS)  ANY KIND OF MURDER IS NOT  DELICIOUS.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK SO,  EITHER. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE IT  TEMPTING.
(LAUGHS)
Stephen: (LAUGHS)  THANK YOU. WELL, LISTEN, EVEN AFTER THIS  CONVERSATION WOULD YOU BE  WILLING TO DO SOME MUSIC?
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU'RE VERY  FORGIVING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A  PERFORMANCE BY MORRISSEY.
