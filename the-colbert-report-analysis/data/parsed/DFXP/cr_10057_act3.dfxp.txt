(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK ABOUT MODERN PARENTING ALSO KNOWN AS THE IPAD. PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER SENIOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, JENNIFER. GOOD SEEING YOU. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. ALRIGHT YOU'RE A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR OF NEW YORK MAGAZINE, REGULAR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES" BOOK REVIEW. YOU GOT A NEW BOOK, IT'S MAKING A BIT OF A SPLASH, CALLED "ALL JOY AND NO FUN, THE PARADOX OF MODERN PARENTING." WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALL JOY AND NO FUN? WHERE'S THE JOY AND WHAT'S THE FUN SUPPOSED TO BE?
(LAUGHS) I'M GOING TO FLIP THOSE AROUND.
Stephen: OKAY.
SO IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT THERE'S NO FUN IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DRUDGERY IN PARENTING, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BOREDOM.
Stephen: IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE NEWS? (LAUGHTER) THE POINT OF PARENTING IS THAT--
IS TO BE IMMENSELY BORED.
Stephen: YOU SACRIFICE FOR THEM UNTIL THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND THEN YOU SAY "ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME?" (LAUGHTER) "HOW ABOUT AN APOLOGY?"
IT'S TOTALLY TRUE. AND THEY'RE INGRATES.  YOU'RE RIGHT, NO YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT THE JOY, AS WE KNOW, IT'S INCOMPARABLE.
Stephen: THE JOY IS THE HARD PART.
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, JOY IS VERY HARD TO TOLERATE.
Stephen: WHAT?
YES! THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS I LEARNED IN MY BOOK. BECAUSE, JOY, YOU ARE SO DEEPLY BONDED TO SOMETHING, RIGHT, YOU LOVE SOMETHING SO MUCH
Stephen: SOMEONE, HOPEFULLY.
YES, EXACTLY. SO IMAGINE -- HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HEARD A PARENT SAY TO YOU "I'M LOOKING AT MY KID, HE'S BEAUTIFUL IN HIS CRIB, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH AND THEN I IMAGINE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENING." RIGHT? I MEAN, IT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU ASSOCIATE -- (AUDIENCE REACTS) NOT RINGING A BELL? NEVER HAPPENS TO YOU?
Stephen: NO. I OFTEN THINK WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME? [LAUGHTER] WHY AREN'T I YOUNG ANYMORE?  WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FACE?
WELL, THE OTHER 99% OF US DO. SO THAT IS A HARDER FEELING TO TOLERATE THAN SADNESS, ALMOST.
Stephen: WELL, NO, NO, IT IS THERE'S AN EXQUISITE AGONY IN  KNOWING THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL THING IS HERE AND SOMEDAY IT WILL NOT BE HERE. EVEN IF THINGS GO RIGHT YOUR CHILD WILL GROW OLD AND DIE. [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. ALRIGHT THAT WAS...
(LAUGHS) PLEASURE. THANK YOU. LET ME GIVE YOU THE LINE THAT I THOUGHT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. HE SAID, THIS PSYCHIATRIST I TALKED TO PUT IT BEAUTIFULLY, HE SAID  JOY IS GRIEF INSIDE OUT AND THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS FUN. THAT'S DIFFERENT.
Stephen: OK, JOY IS GRIEF INSIDE OUT? THIS GUY NEEDS TO GO TO  BETTER BARS. (LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE RIGHT!
Stephen: I MEAN, ALL JOY AND NO FUN-- IS HAPPINESS ONE OF THESE TWO?
HERE'S THE THING YOU HAVE TO KNOW. SO IN STUDY AFTER STUDY PARENTS COME ACROSS AS LESS HAPPY THAN NON-PARENTS. ACCORDING TO SOCIAL SCIENCE.
Stephen: IS THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING? NO THAT'S A SERIOUS QUESTION. IS THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING, IS HAPPINESS A GOAL?
I WOULD ARGUE NO. I THINK  IT'S OVERRATED. I THINK IT'S A FALSE GOD.
Stephen: I TOTALLY AGREE THAT HAPPINESS IS OVERRATED. (LAUGHTER) I DO BELIEVE IT. >>Stephen: I DO TOO. HAPPINESS IS FOR THE WEAK. [LAUGHTER] WE ARE NOT HERE TO BE HAPPY, WE ARE HERE TO PROCREATE, TO MAKE MORE CHILDREN AND INFECT THEM WITH OUR WORLD VIEW WHICH MIGHT NOT -- THEY MIGHT ALSO NOT BE HAPPY. (LAUGHTER)
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN, LET ME TELL YOU, WHAT KIDS WERE FOR. THEY WERE OUR STAFF. THEY USED TO WORK FOR US.
Stephen: OH THEY STILL ARE, THEY STILL ARE.
IN THE COLBERT HOUSE.
Stephen: BUD IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT, GARBAGE. IT'S SNOWING, GO OUTSIDE.
BUT THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, I THINK EVER SINCE THE PROGRESSIVE ERA WE DON'T ACTUALLY -- WE NOW WORK FOR THEM. WE TAKE THEM TO SOCCER PRACTICE AND BABY GYMBOREE, WE TAKE THEM TO VIOLIN LESSONS. ALL WITHOUT ANY IDEA THAT WE ARE NECESSARILY -- WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS HELPING THEM OR US.
Stephen: SHOULD WE NEGLECT THEM? (LAUGHTER) I'M CURIOUS, I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID I GREW UP ON A DIRT ROAD, MOM PUSHED ME OUT IN THE MORNING AND SAID "I'LL RING THE BELL FOR LUNCH, I'LL RING THE BELL FOR DINNER, TRY NOT TO HURT YOURSELF."
NO, PRECISELY. EXACTLY. AND THEY PUT YOU IN PLAYPENS.  THAT WAS OKAY. CONFINEMENT WAS OKAY. >>Stephen: SURE OK BUT HERE'S THE THING. THE BETTY DRAPER STYLE OF NEGLECT I WOULDN'T ADVOCATE. THE CHAINSMOKING AND DRINKING LIKE IN "MAD MEN." BUT THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR MAYBE NOT HOVERING QUITE SO MUCH AND I THINK WE'D ALL FEEL BETTER.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A CHILD?
I DO.
Stephen: HOW OLD IS YOUR CHILD?
HE'S SIX.
Stephen: SIX. SO ARE YOU HERE JUST TO GET AWAY FROM HIM? (LAUGHTER) JUST, AHH. AHH, ANYTHING.
THAT WOULD BE A REALLY ELABORATE RUSE TO GET AWAY FROM MY KID. I WROTE A BOOK TO COME ON HERE JUST TO GET AWAY FROM MY KIDS FOR SIX MINUTES.
Stephen: NOW WHEN HE'S OLDER ARE YOU GOING TO USE THE PROCEEDS OF THIS BOOK TO PAY FOR HIS THERAPY WHEN HE READS IT AND FINDS OUT HE MADE YOU SO UNHAPPY?
I'M TERRIBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THAT. I AM ACTUALLY REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT IT.
Stephen: PLEASE COME BACK IN 20 YEARS AND TELL US HOW HE'S DOING.
I WILL!
Stephen: JENNIFER SENIOR. THE BOOK IS "ALL JOY AND NO FUN." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
