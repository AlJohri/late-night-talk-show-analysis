TONIGHT: WHAT IS AMERICA'S NEW OPPRESSED MINORITY? IN THE OFFICE POOL, I PICKED GAY INUITS. THEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS A BREAKTHROUGH IN NEW ENERGY, THEY'RE HOOKING BIDEN UP TO A GERBIL WHEEL. AND MY GUESTS, POP GROUP LAKE STREET DIVE, DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS TWO GIRLS, TWO GUYS AND A WHOLE  LOT OF FEELINGS. FINE BUT THEY'RE STILL SPLITTING ONE CHEESE PLATE. [LAUGHTER] NEW YORK CITY IS RUNNING LOW ON ROAD SALT. NO WONDER MY COMMUTE WAS SO BLAND. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.       Captioning sponsored by    COMEDY CENTRAL [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO THE REPORT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I GOTTA SAY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND IT'S NOT JUST  THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CHANTING THOUGH IT DOESN'T HURT IN ANY WAY, I DON'T SAY THIS EVERY NIGHT  WHEN I GO ON AIR. THERE IS NO DOUBT, AND I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE FROM MY FACE THAT TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF AMERICA AND EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE   I AM IN A TERRIFIC MOOD.  YES, YES! IT'S FREEZING OUTSIDE. YES, DIRTY SLUSH IS EVERYWHERE, AND YES I HAD TO PUSH A FRAIL WOMAN IN FRONT OF A SALT TRUCK TO GET A CAB (LAUGHTER) ONCE AGAIN MY APOLOGIES TO DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. BUT STILL I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE RELEASED PROJECTIONS ON THE NUMBER OF JOBS OBAMACARE WILL COST AND THE NEWS IS HORRIBLE. (LAUGHTER) JIM?
TURNS OUT THE CBO NOW SAYS PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW WILL CUT THE NUMBER OF FULL-TIME JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES BY 2.3 MILLION BY 2021.
IT'S A BOMBSHELL THAT HAS BEEN DROPPED BY THE  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET  OFFICE WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN BEAN COUNTERS.
THIS WAS REALLY KIND OF A SURPRISE AND A FRESH BLOW TO THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW.
THIS IS A JOB KILLER.
I TOLD YOU. (LAUGHTER) OH, NOBODY BELIEVED ME WHEN I SAID OBAMACARE WAS A JOB KILLER. AND NOW IT IS. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY ROLL OUT THE DEATH PANELS AND THE ELDER CATAPULTS. [LAUGHTER] I BROKE THAT STORY. BUT NO SURPRISE, OBAMA UNLEASHED HIS ECONOMIC NERD PATROL TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE NUMBERS.
IN FACT, WHAT CBO FOUND, AND THIS IS THEIR SUMMARY QUOTE NEAR THE TOP OF APPENDIX C, AGAIN, QUOTE,  THE ESTIMATED REDUCTION, THIS IS THE REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL QUANTITY OF LABOR, ALL OF YOU HAVE SEEN AND TALKED ABOUT,  SO THE ESTIMATED REDUCTION STEMS ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM A NET DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF LABOR THAT WORKERS CHOOSE TO SUPPLY RATHER THAN FROM A NET DROP IN BUSINESSES DEMAND FOR LABOR. [LAUGHTER] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MOM, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL. [LAUGHTER] IT'S A SNOW DAY. RIGHT, TV. OKAY. BACK IN THE GAME, OKAY. WHERE WAS I. OKAY, SURE, SURE, WHAT  PROFESSOR LUNESTA SAID IS TECHNICALLY TRUE. [LAUGHTER] OBAMACARE GIVES PEOPLE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS ALLOWING THEM TO WORK LESS IF THEY CHOOSE. BUT WHAT LOOKS BETTER ON A BUMPER STICKER, OBAMACARE JOB KILLER VOTE GOP OR OBAMACARE'S ESTIMATED REDUCTION IN THE WORKFORCE STEMS ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM A NET DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF LABOR THAT WORKERS CHOOSE TO SUPPLY RATHER THAN FROM A NET DROP IN BUSINESSES DEMAND FOR LABOR, VOTE DEMOCRAT. BESIDES, BESIDES, PEOPLE SHOULD BE CHAINED BY THEIR THEIR NEED FOR INSURANCE TO JOBS THEY HATE. THAT IS WHAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY. YOU THINK ANYONE WANTED TO BE A PILGRIM? NO! BUT THEY STUCK IT OUT FOR THE BUCKLE INSURANCE. (LAUGHTER) EVEN THEN, EVEN THEN IT WAS A PRETTY HIGH BUCKLE DEDUCTIBLE. (LAUGHTER) BUCKLE DEDUCTIBLE. (LAUGHTER) IN OTHER NEWS, FOLKS, IT'S NO SECRET THAT AMERICA'S WEALTHY ARE UNDER SIEGE. IT'S LIKE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THESE DAYS. BUT OUR POOR PEOPLE ARE TOO LAZY TO PUT ON UPLIFTING MUSICALS. BUT THEY'VE GOT PLENTY OF ENERGY TO DEMONIZE MY FRIEND VENTURE CAPITALIST TOM PERKINS. HE IS SUDDENLY PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE JUST BECAUSE HE HAD THE COURAGE TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POVERTY.
THERE IS OUTRAGE TODAY OVER COMMENTS MADE BY VENTURE CAPITALIST TOM PERKINS IN A LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" HE WROTE, QUOTING NOW, WRITING FROM THE EPICENTER OF PROGRESSIVE THOUGHT, SAN FRANCISCO, I WOULD CALL ATTENTION TO THE PARALLELS OF FASCIST NAZI GERMANY TO ITS WAR ON ITS 1%, NAMELY ITS JEWS, TO THE PROGRESSIVE WAR ON THE AMERICAN 1%, NAMELY THE RICH.
Stephen: WELL SAID, TOM, WELL SAID. THERE IS NO BETTER WAY TO FIGHT BIGOTRY THAN EQUATING JEWS TO A WEALTHY CABAL WHO CONTROL WORLD BUSINESS. [LAUGHTER] NOW SOME SAY MR. PERKINS HERE IS OUT OF TOUCH. BUT I SAY HE IS SPOT ON WITH HIS NAZI ANALOGY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO ELSE CALLED THEIR ENEMIES NAZIS, THE JEWS. WHO LOOKS LIKE AN ANTI-SEMITE NOW? IT'S STILL ME? OK GOT TO WORK ON THAT. GOT TO WORK ON THAT. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, DESPITE NEAR UNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION TOM PERKINS SOMEHOW FOUND THE COURAGE TO GO ON A NETWORK OWNED BY A BILLIONAIRE TO MAKE HIS CASE TO THE NONBILLIONAIRES.
YOU ARE A MULTIMILLIONAIRE.
NO, I'M NOT A BILLIONAIRE
I SAID MULTIMILLIONAIRE.
I'VE CREATED SOME BILLIONAIRES BUT I UNFORTUNATELY AM NOT ONE. THIS ISN'T A ROLEX,  I COULD BUY A SIX PACK OF ROLEXES FOR THIS, BUT SO WHAT.
YEAH, SO WHAT, HE'S JUST A REGULAR NONBILLIONAIRE JOE SIX PACK OF ROLEXES. BUT SOMEHOW THIS APPEARANCE FAILED TO WIN OVER THE 99% THANKS TO PRESIDENT OBAMALIB AND THE PROGRESSOCRATS DEMAGOGUING ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY, THE POPE ATTACKING THE SO-CALLED IDOLATRY OF MONEY AND HOLLYWOOD VILIFYING THE WEALTHIEST 1% OF DRAGONS. [LAUGHTER] I MEAN COME ON, COME ON, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG? HOW ABOUT THE APPRECIATION OF SMAUG. DON'T GET MAD AT HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PUT EVERYTHING IN GOLD. I MEAN NO WONDER WE WEALTHY FEEL OUR ENEMIES CLOSING IN. AS ONE ANONYMOUS 1%ER TOLD "POLITICO" THE RICH FEAR THEY'RE IN DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE. YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO SEE CONSPIRACIES EVERYWHERE. YES, BECAUSE CONSPIRACIES ARE EVERYWHERE. TELL ME THIS, IF THERE IS NO PLOT AGAINST THE RICH PEOPLE, HOW COME SOMEONE IS KEEPING A LIST OF THE RICHEST PEOPLE? (LAUGHTER) OKAY? THINK ABOUT IT. [cheers and applause] OH, OH, AND THE RICH WON'T BE SAFE AT HOME. I MEAN THERE ARE MILLIONS OF POOR PEOPLE OUT THERE. JUST LOOK AT THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE OUTSIDE MY GATED COMMUNITY. DON'T, DON'T, DON'T LET ONE OF THEM BITE YOU. THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME POOR TOO. DO WHAT I DO, TO HOLD THEM AT BAY I ALWAYS CARRY A PHOTO OF ME AND BONO. SO WHEN THE POORS COME FOR ME I CAN PROVE I KNOW A GUY WHO DOES AFRICA STUFF. THE POINT IS, THIS IS CLASS WARFARE PLAIN AND SIMPLE, AND THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN AMERICA BECAUSE WE ARE A COUNTRY WITHOUT CLASS DISTINCTION. HERE TO AGREE WITH ME IS REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, OWNER OF THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", AND FELLOW AMERICAN MORT ZUCKERMAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MORT -- (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NOW MORT, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU AT THE CLUB LATELY TO TALK ABOUT THIS. BUT YOU DO ALL RIGHT. DO YOU BELIEVE OUR FELLOW WEALTHY ARE TRULY WORRIED ABOUT ALL THIS DEMAGOGUERY?
I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE. I ACTUALLY THINK THE ISSUE IS NOT REALLY THE WEALTHY, THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF JUST INEQUALITY, IT'S A QUESTION OF NO JOBS.
Stephen: SO DO YOU THINK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THINGS LIKE CALLING FOR A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE OR CALLING FOR HIGHER TAXES ON THE WEALTHY, A REDISTROBUTION OF WEALTH, THOSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO WHIP UP POOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THEY'RE CHOOSING GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME AS EASY TARGETS?
WELL, I MEAN, I CERTAINLY THINK YOU ARE AN EASY TARGET. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: WELL, I DON'T HAVE YOUR SECURITY TEAM.
NO I THINK-- LOOK, I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN PROGRESSIVE TAXATION. I DON'T HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT. I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN A FAIR WAGE BUT I DO THINK WHEN YOU HAVE AS WE DO HAVE TODAY 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE EITHER PART-TIME WORKERS OR HAVE NO JOBS AND HAVE GIVEN UP LOOKING FOR WORK, WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN NOT SINCE THE 1930s. THAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: YOU WROTE THAT ANONYMOUS QUOTE, THAT SOME RICH PEOPLE ARE GETTING WORRIED THAT THEY'RE BEING MADE SCAPE GOATS, DO YOU FEEL THAT IT'S FAIR. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR FOR US TO BE TARGETED JUST BECAUSE WE'VE DONE WELL.
LISTEN,.
Stephen: I DON'T FIND THAT FUNNY. (LAUGHTER)
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CERTAIN SORT OF-- AS THE FRENCH WOULD SAY OF THE-- .
Stephen: I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN SAY THAT ON TELEVISION.
WHAT IS THAT.
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CERTAIN HOSTILITY IN THIS COUNTRY TO THE WEALTHY. IT HAS BEEN WITH US FOR A 100 YEARS AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THIS COUNTRY THAT IF YOU HAVE ENERGY AND TALENT YOU CAN MOVE UP THE INCOME LADDER OR WEALTH LADDER UP TO YOUR OWN ABILITIES AND THAT'S BEEN A PART OF MAKES THIS COUNTRY GREAT.
Stephen: YOU USED TO SUPPORT OBAMA ARE YOU STILL ON BOARD WITH THIS GUY?
NO, I STOPPED BEING A SUPPORTER OF HIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT HIS POLICIES DID NOT DO EXACTLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT TO CREATE ENOUGH JOBS AND STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. I THOUGHT HE HAD A VERY WEAK RECOVERY PROGRAM FROM WHAT WAS A RECESSION THAT WE WERE IN. AND THAT, WHEN I SAW THAT, AND I WAS UP CLOSE TO HIM, THAT HE WAS MORE FOCUSED ON THE POLITICS OF THE ISSUE THAN ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ISSUE, I THOUGHT THIS GUY IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY. WHICH IS A LACK OF JOBS FOR ENOUGH PEOPLE.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY FRIEND TOM PERKINS ANALOGY THAT RICH PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER OF BEING TREATED LIKE THE JEWS IN NAZI GERMANY, DO YOU THINK THAT IS A FAIR COMPARISON.
I THINK IT AN OUTRAGEOUS COMPARISON, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
Stephen: I AGREE WITH YOU BECAUSE THE PEASANTS RISING UP AGAINST THE URBAN ELITE IS REALLY MORE LIKE THE KHMER ROUGE, ISN'T IT? [LAUGHTER]
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THIS VILLIFYING OF THE RICH. THE POPE UPSETS ME, YOU KNOW, THAT HE SAID, YOU KNOW THERE IS THIS IDOLATRY OF MONEY. AND IS HE UPSETTING YOU ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH? [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU THINKING OF LEAVING.
SUCH A GOOD QUESTION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO MY RABBI BEFORE I GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.
Stephen: PLEASE. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, MORT, MORT ZUCKERMAN, EVERYBODY. FROM NEW YORK DAILY NEWS.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
