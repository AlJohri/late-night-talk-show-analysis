TODAY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON.
THE BEGINNING OF THE ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON. >
HURRICANE SEASON.
YES, HURRICANE SEASON SEEMS TO COME EARLIER AND EARLIER EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THANKS TO GLOBAL WARMING IT NEVER REALLY ENDS. (LAUGHTER) BUT HERE'S MY NUMBER ONE HURRICANE SEASON SAFETY TIP. IF YOU LIVE ANYWHERE ON THE COAST FROM GALVESTON, TEXAS, TO WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA, DON'T. (LAUGHTER) NOW WE'VE JUST FOUND OUT WE'VE JUST FOUND OUT, FOLKS, WHEN IT COMES TO HURRICANES THERE IS A NEW NAME FOR DANGER. AND IT'S GIRLY.
ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT MORE THAN 60 YEARS OF DEATH TOLLS FROM HURRICANES AND THEY FOUND FEMALE-NAMED HURRICANES KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN THE MALE ONES. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES. OH YES. WHEN IT COMES TO DESTRUCTION, THE LADY STORM SHATTERED THE GLASS CEILING-- WELL, THE GLASS EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER) ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, PEOPLE DON'T TAKE HURRICANES AS SERIOUSLY IF THEY HAVE A FEMININE NAME. AND NEITHER CONSIDER THEM AS RISKY NOR TAKE THE SAME PRECAUTION. HEY, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. I HEAR HURRICANE IRENE IS COMING, I SAY WOW, SHE SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY LADY. SO I GO OUT TO GREET HER IN THE YARD WITH A BUCKET OF NAILS. NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M FLOATING PAST A HIGH SCHOOL CLINGING TO A BLOATED COW CARCASS. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE FLOAT OF SHAME. (LAUGHTER) THE STUDY EVEN SUGGESTS THAT CHANGING A SEVERE HURRICANE'S NAME FROM CHARLEY TO ELOISE COULD NEARLY TRIPLE ITS DEATH TOLL, WHICH MEANS IF CHARLEY MANSON HAD CHANGED HIS NAME TO ELOISE MANSON, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THREE TIMES AS HOMICIDAL. BECAUSE EVERYBODY TRUSTS A NICE LADY WITH A FOREHEAD SWASTIKA. NOW FOLKS, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO THINK THIS IS PURE SEXISM REFLECTING A DEEP NEED FOR FROM MEANINGFUL SOCIAL CHANGE, WHATEVER. BUT IN THE MEANTIME I SAY WE CAN USE THIS BIAS TO KEEP US ALL SAFE THIS YEAR BY MAKING EVERY STORM SOUND AS BAD-ASS AND MASCULINE AS POSSIBLE WITH WEATHER ALERTS LIKE THIS.
THIS SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY, THROUGH OCTOBER, TOBER, TOBER, EL NINO BECOMES A MAN. AND BRINGS YOU HURRICANE BUTCH  MCBALLS BACK-TO-BACK WITH TROPICAL STORM MAGNUS VAN THUNDER CROTCH, THE CONDO KILLER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO BE THERE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: AND THAT'S--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NATION, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF AMAZON. ITS HE THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN GET ALL YOUR SHOPPING DONE IN YOUR UNDERWEAR, AT LEAST SINCE THEY  CLOSED CIRCUIT CITY. AMAZON SELLS EVERYTHING, A SCOOBY DOO CHEST SET, A NEON FULL BODY LYKRA SUIT, A SAMPLER PACK OF KANGAROO JERKY, A SHED TO HIDE YOUR DISTURBING AMAZON PURCHASES FROM YOUR FAMILY. BUT NOW I'M NOT JUST MAD AT AMAZON, I'M MAD PRIME. BECAUSE I JUST FOUND OUT THAT THEY ARE DETERRING CUSTOMERS FROM BUYING BOOKS BY STEPHEN COLBERT. AND AS ANY LONG TIME VIEWER OF THIS SHOW KNOWS, THAT'S ME. THEY'RE FIGHTING WITH MY PUBLISHER HACHETTE AND AMAZON IS PLAYING HARD COVER.
AMAZON SEEMS TO BE STEPPING UP ITS BATTLE WITH BOOK PUBLISHER HACHETTE, NOW REFUSING ORDERS FOR SOME UPCOMING HACHETTE BOOKS.
AMAZON HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF USING DIFFERENT TACTICS TO QUIETLY DETER PUBLISHES FROM BUYING BOOKS FROM HACHETTE.
AMAZON HAS BEEN ACCUSED FROM RAISING PRICES TO DELIBERATELY DELAYING SHIPMENTS.
DELAYING SHIPMENTS. SOMETIMES THREE TO FOUR WEEKS. FOLKS, THAT IS JUST CRUEL. IF YOU ORDERED HACHETTE'S 21 DAY WEIGHT LOSS BY THE TIME IT ARRIVES, YOU'RE STILL FAT. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS IS A BIG BLOW-- IT'S A BIG BLOW TO MY BOTTOM LINE. BECAUSE AMAZON CONTROLS AROUND 50% OF ALL BOOK SALES. THAT'S RIGHT. 30 BOOKS A YEAR! (LAUGHTER) AMAZON EVEN RELEASED A STATEMENT ENCOURAGING CUSTOMERS TO BUY USED COPIES OF HACHETTE BOOKS FROM OTHER SELLERS. FOLKS, PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS GET NO CASH FROM USED BOOK SALES. PLUS, YOU DON'T WANT THEM. (LAUGHTER) USED BOOKS ARE THE SLUTS OF THE LITERARY WORLD, PASSED  AROUND FROM PERSON TO PERSON, SPREADING THEIR PAGES FOR ANYONE, GETTING CHEAPER AND CHEAPER UNTIL EVENTUALLY THEY END UP IN PRISON. (LAUGHTER) AND I AM NOT THE ONLY VICTIM HERE. TAKE HARRY POTTER AUTHOR JK ROWLING. AMAZON HAS TAKEN THE PREORDER BUTTONS OFF HER NEW HACHETTE BOOK THE SILKWORM, A VICIOUS TACTIC BY AMAZON'S C.E.O. JEFF BEZOS, OR SHOULD I SAY LORD BEZO-MORT. AND THIS-- THIS HAS PUSHED ME PAST MY TIPPING POINT. I THINK. BECAUSE I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY COPY OF HACHETTE AUTHOR MALCOLM GLADWELL'S NOVEL THE TIPPING POINT. I TELL YOU WHAT, AMAZON, I HAVE GOT A LITTLE PACKAGE FOR YOU RIGHT HERE, OKAY. THIS PACKAGE IS CARE OF ME, JK ROWLING AND EXPLAINO THE CLOWN HERE, OKAY. ALL RIGHT? IT IS SHIPPED IMMEDIATELY AND A LOT OF PACKAGING, ALL RIGHT. AND I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO LIKE IT. OH, WAIT A SECOND. HERE IT. (APPLAUSE) OH, WAIT, AMAZON, CUSTOMERS THAT ENJOY THIS ALSO BOUGHT THIS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO WATCH OUT BEZOS, BECAUSE THIS MEANS WAR. AND SURE AMAZON MAY HAVE AN ARMY OF DRONES BUT HACHETTE HAS-- WHATEVER A HACHETTE IS. I'M GOING SAY A TINY FRENCH HACHETTE. AND HERE TO HELP ME FIGHT BACK IS WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AND THE KEN FAULKNER AWARD MY FELLOW AMAZON VICTIM SHERMAN ALEXIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU WANT TO POP SOME BUBBLE WRAP?
YEAH.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. SHERMAN EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF THE ABSOLUTELY TRUE DIARY OF A PART-TIME INDIAN. WHY IS AMAZON DOING THIS TO US?
I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE HERE. IF AMAZON HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE TRAVEL IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME TWO TO FIVE WEEKS TO GET HERE.
YEAH, YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE THEY WON A MONOPOLY. THEY CONTROL 40 TO 50% OF THE BOOK MARKET AND THEY WANT MORE. AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO THAT IS BY FORCING THE PRICE LOWER AND LOWER AND LOWER AND MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MORE AND MORE PUBLISHERS TO PUBLISH THEIR BOOK.
IS THIS A GIANT, IS THIS A GIANT CREATING MONOPOLY TRYING TO CRUSH THE LITTLE GUY?
NO, IT'S TWO GIANTS FIGHTING EACH OTHER. HACHETTE IS A BIG CORPORATION. A GIANT CORPORATION BUT-- WHO DO I ROOT FOR THEN?
YOU ROOT FOR THE AUTHORS. YOU ROOT FOR THE AUTHOR, THAT'S YOU.
THAT'S ME.
WE'RE ROOT FOR EACH OTHER. BECAUSE I WAS ON MY SIDE BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. WHAT CAN WE AS THE VICTIMS IN THIS FIGHT, WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT BACK?
NUMBER ONE, YOU DON'T SHOP THERE. FOR ANYTHING.
AT AMAZON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
UNTIL THIS IS SETTLED.
UNTIL THIS IS SETTLED BUT THE FACT IS THAT AMAZON CONTROLS SO MUCH OF OUR WORLD THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT. BECAUSE THEY'RE ON THE INTERNET AND INVISIBLE WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THEIR NOMINATION.
IT'S TOUGHEST ON YOUNG AUTHORS WHO ARE BEING PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME.
MUCH IN THE WAY AMAZON HAS CREATED THIS FOR PRE PUBLICITY, IT'S EVERYTHING. THE FORTUNES OF A MOVIE ARE DETERMINED BEFORE IT'S EVER SCREENED IN THE THEATRE. THE FORTUNES OF A BOOK ARE DETERMINED BEFORE IT EVER HITS THE SHELF. PRE-PUBLICITY AND PRE-SALES DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF A BOOK.
SO THE FACT THAT LIKE FIRST TIME AUTHORS CAN'T GET ANY PRESALES OR ORDERS ARE DELAYED IS REALLY HURTING.
THE BOOK IS DEAD.
OKAY, HERE IS ONE THAT YOU RECOMMENDED. IT'S CALLED CALIFORNIA BY EDAN LEPUCKI, ALL RIGHT, A GOOD ONE.
AN INCREDIBLE BOOK. IT'S A BOOK SET IN MID APOCALYPTIC UNITED STATES WHERE AN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL POLITICAL APOCALYPSE HAS HAPPENED AND IT'S A LOVE STORY OF THIS YOUNG COUPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE.
HAVE WE LOST ANY BIG CITIES?
LOS ANGELES GOES, AND --
SO IT'S GOT A HAPPY ENDING.
YES, EXACTLY.
OKAY. SO HERE'S THE DEAL. RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY PREORDER THIS ON AMAZON BECAUSE OF THIS GAME THEY'RE PLAYING WITH MY PUBLISHER. INSTEAD I WANT YOU TO GO TO MY WEBSITE  COLBERTNATION.COM. WE HAVE GOT A DEAL WITH POWELL'S BOOKS FROM PORTLAND. YOU CAN ORDER THIS BOOK THROUGH MY WEBSITE, THROUGH-- AND WE'RE GOING TO PROVE THAT I CAN SELL MORE BOOKS THAN AMAZON. ALL RIGHT, AND WHEN YOU BUY IT, DON'T FORGET, DON'T FORGET ALL ALSO MY WEBSITE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS SHEET OF STICKERS, IT SAYS I DIDN'T BUY IT ON AMAZON. PEEL IT OFF AND THEN PUT IT RIGHT ON ANY BOOK THAT YOU ARE READING, OKAY. AND REMEMBER, IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY STICKER PRINTER PAPER, YOU CAN ORDER FROM AMAZON. THEY SELL-- IT'S CHEAP AND YOU CAN GET IT THE NEXT DAY. SHERMAN ALEXIE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SHERMAN ALEXIE, CALIFORNIA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
