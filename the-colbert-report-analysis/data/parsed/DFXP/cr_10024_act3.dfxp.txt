Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE CO-FOUNDER OF THE SOCIAL NEWS SIGHT, HE'S GOT CALLED RED IF. HE HAS A NEW BOOK AND I HAVEN'T READ IT. PLEASE WELCOME ALEXIS O HANDIAN. ALEXIS, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING ON. WE MET A COUPLE TIMES BEFORE.
YES.
COULDN'T DRESS UP.
I SEE, I SPUT ON A SWAKET.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT.
A SWEATER JACKET. THAT IS HOW I WAS TOLD TO DRESS. I'M WISE, I LISTEN MY GIRLFRIEND.
Stephen: NOW BESIDES BEING SORT OF AN EARLY INTERNET WONDERKIN WITH BEING CO-FOUNDER OF RED T EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS. I HAVE EXPLAINED IT ON THE SHOW BEFORE AND PEOPLE THAT ARE ON IT THE NEXT DAY GO THAT IS NOT WHAT RED IT IS. WHAT IS RED IT.
IS A PLATFORM FOR ON-LINE COMMUNITITES TO SHARE LINKS AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT IS NEW AND INTERESTING ON THE INTERNET.
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH IT. THIS IS MY PROBLEM WITH READ IT. MY PROBLEM IS THAT THERE USED TO BE A TIME WHEN THERE WAS A CLASS OF CULTURAL CASE MAKERS LIKE MYSELF WHO TOLD YOU WHAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO READ OR SEE TODAY. WHEREAS ON READ IT EVERYBODY GETS TO POST AND EVERYBODY GETS A VOTE, EVERYBODY GETS TO GOIAY,-- YAY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT? I SAY OOOH. OKAY. WHY SHOULD EVERYBODY GET A VOTE AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD ALL BE RAEBDING. THAT IS CULTURAL SOCIALISM.
I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A LITTLE BIT OF DEMOCRACY ON-LINE, THE IDEA THAT ANY ONE OF US HAS A GREAT IDEA WORTH SHARING OR AN OPINION WORTH HEARING IS SORT OF BAKED INTO HOW THAT PLATFORM WORKS AND HOW THIS COUNTRY WORKS.
BUT ON READ IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN AGE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PROPERTY OWNER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASS A LITERACY TEST, ALL THE THINGS WE LOOK FOR IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
THAT'S RIGHT, WE WANTED IT TO BE AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE. AND THE HOPE IS MORE PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ACCESS NOW CAN. AND WHO CAN NOW SHARE THEIR IDEAS WHO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEFORE.
Stephen: OKAY, SPEAKING OF SHARING IDEA, YOU ARE SHARING IDEAS IN A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. OKAY. WHAT IS IT YOU ARE DOING WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION AND WHO IS THEY?
IT IS THE GATEKEEPERS, IT IS THIS IDEA THAT ON-LINE WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED PERMISSIONLESS INNOVATION. THE IDEA THAT ANYBODY WITH A GREAT IDEA CAN SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD, WHETHER IT IS A BUSINESS OR A NONPROFIT OR AN ART PROJECT OR ACTIVISM. AND THAT MEANS WE GET TO SURFACE MORE IDEAS AND CREATIVITY FROM MORE PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH GATEKEEPERS.
Stephen: DON'T GATEKEEPERS TELL US WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD?
GATEKEEPERS SOMETIMES GET IT RIGHT. JON STEWART HAD A GOOD CHOICE BRINGING YOU ON BOARD.
Stephen: I WAS AT THE DAILY SHOW BEFORE HE WAS BUT GO AHEAD.
Stephen: WHATEVER, WHATEVER, THAT'S NOT A KNOCK, THAT'S JUST A FACT.
THE HOPE IS WITH A PLATFORM LIKE READ IT OR THE INTERNET WE GET TO HEAR FROM MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THE GOOD FORTUNE OF FINDING THE RIGHT GATEKEEPER AT THE RIGHT TIME.
Stephen: SO IF I WANTED TO DO AN INTERNET START UP, WHAT DO YOU DO? I KNOW YOU START AND THAT IS WHERE YOU START, YOU START ON-LINE. THE LAST THING YOU DID YOU SELL IT TO GOOGLE FOR $4 BILLION. WHAT DO YOU DO IN BETWEEN. HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO FUND YOU ON THE INTERNET, CAN YOU USE THE INTERNET TO FUND YOU ON THE INTERNET?
YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDDICK LOSE BUT IT'S A AZ MAGAZINE. WITH-- WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WHO ARE GOING TO HELP THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS WITH GREAT IDEAS.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE YOU THEN.
THERE ARE MORE OF THESE CROWD FUNDING PLATFORMS THAT LET SOMEONE WITH A GREAT IDEA TO RAISE FUNDING, KICK STARTER IS AN ON VIEWS ONE. IN THE LAST YEAR MORE MONEY HAS GONE THROUGH THAT FOR ART PROGRAMS THAN THROUGH THE NATIONAL ENDURE-- ENDOWMENT OF THE ARTS.
Stephen: MORE DOLLARS.
MORE DOLLARS, YES.
Stephen: HAVE WE REACHED THE DREAM OF KILLING THE NEA?
I DON'T THINK-- THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. I LIKE KNOWING WE GET TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO MAKE A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE OF HAMLET CAN GET A BOOK PUBLISHED THANKS TO THE INTERNET AND A BFERJ OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: DID THAT HAPPEN.
IT DID, IT RAISED OVER $600,000 FOR THAT BOOK.
Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS IN TO HAMLET IN THIS TIME.
IT'S SOMETHING YOU CHOOSE-- YOU CHOOSE WHATEVER ADVENTURE YOU LIKE. YOU COULD TAKE D I MEAN I CAN'T POSSIBLY TELL YOU ALL THE OPTIONS, YOU HAVE TO READ THE BOOK. BUT THERE ARE MANY.
Stephen: IT'S A SAD STORY.
YOU CAN HAVE IT TURN OUT BETTER.
Stephen: REALLY, YOU CAN HAVE A HAPPY HAMLET?
YES, LIKE OPHELIA LIVES AND-- IS NOT HIDING BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
AND WHAT IS SO EXCITING.
Stephen: TO BE OR NOT TO BE, DEFINITELY TO BE. NOW WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION ARE YOU RIGHT NOW ON A FIVE MONTH BUS TOUR TO PROMOTE INTERNET ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: WOULDN'T THERE BE AN EASIER WAY TO DO THAT SAY ON THE INTERNET?
TOUCHE.
Stephen: I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH OR WHATEVER.
I WANTED AN EXCUSE TO RENT A BUS AND A T-SHIRT CANON AND VISIT 77 UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE MY FELLOW MILLENNIALS ARE THE ONES WHO WILL BE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THIS AMAZING STUFF. BECAUSE IT IS NOT UNTIL I CAN ACTUALLY GET IF FRONT OF THEM AND HOPEFULLY GIVE THEM THE LECTURE I WISH I HAD AS AN UNDERGRAD THAT WILL GALVANIZE THEM.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT, GIVE THE LECTURE, BOIL IT DOWN TO TEN WORDS WHAT IS THE THING, BECAUSE I'M-- US MILLENNIALS NEED TO HEAR IT.
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, ON AN INTERNET WE'RE ALL LINKS ARE CREATED EQUAL. YOU CAN TAKE A GREAT IDEA AND YOU CAN TAKE ALL OF THAT AMBITION AND ACTUALLY REACH YOUR MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FOR BEING AWESOME THANKS TO THE OPEN INTERNET.
Stephen: YOU'RE A WISEMAN. ALEXIS OHANIAN. THE BOOK IS WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. ALEXIS, WE'LL BE R
