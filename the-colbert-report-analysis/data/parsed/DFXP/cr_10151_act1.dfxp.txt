Stephen: TONIGHT, THE CASINO INDUSTRY SUFFERS A HUGE LOSS, BUT DON'T TELL THEIR WIFE. THEY CAN WIN IT BACK. THEN A NEW WAY TO TRACE MONEY IN POLITICS, AND TOO LATE, THEY FOUND A NEW WAY TO HIDE IT. AND MY GUEST HENRY KISSINGER IS A FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE. HE'LL BE PERFORMING NIKKI MINAJ'S ANACONDA. RESEARCHERS SAY THERE MAY BE A MALE BIRTH CONTROL SHOT BY 2017, WHICH WILL SIT IN YOUR WALLET UNTIL 2020. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE REPORT.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH. (APPLAUSE) NATION -- THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, PLEASE SIT DOWN. NATION, YEAH, AS YOU KNOW, BY NOW IF YOU WERE WATCHING THIS -- IF YOU WERE WATCHING THIS, FOLKS, IF YOU WERE WATCHING THIS ON A TELEVISION, AND I HOPE YOU ARE -- BY NOW PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS GONE ON THE AIR TONIGHT TO OUTLINE HIS PLAN TO  DEGRADE AND DESTROY ISIS.  REPORTS ARE IT WAS ONLY 15 MINUTES LONG IT WOULD MAKE SENSE. YOU DON'T NEED A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO SAY MY FELLOW AMERICANS-- (BOMB NOISES) (LAUGHTER) THEN I ASSUME HE FILLS OUT THE HOUR BY DOING WEATHER AND SPORTS. NOW I TAPE MY SHOW AT 7:00, FOLKS, SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE SAID TONIGHT. ALL I KNOW IS THAT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT ANDREA TANTAROS SAID AT 5:00, FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
I'M VERY DEEPLY TROUBLED BY WHAT HE WILL SAY.
Stephen: I COULDN'T HAVE AGREED MORE. BECAUSE I ALSO HAVE NOT SEENIT, AND I AM FURIOUS ABOUT  WHAT I ANY IT WILL BE. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL HAVE FULL COVERAGE OF THE SPEECH TOMORROW, WHETHER OR NOT I EVER WATCH IT. (LAUGHTER) #GOLFERINNCHIEF BUT FOLKS, THERE IS ANOTHER FAILURE OF INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP OUT THERE. HIS HOLLINESS THE DALAI LAMA. DON'T LET THE SMILE FOOL YOU, FOLKS, THIS GUY IS NO FUN. HE ALWAYS CHOOSES THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS AND NEVER THE NOBLE DARE.  (LAUGHTER) AND NOW SHAMMA LAMA DING DONG OVER HERE HAS MADE A HUGE  ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WILL AFFECT ALL OF OUR LIVES, INCLUDING OUR FUTURE ONES BECAUSE HE SEES NO NEED FOR A SUCCESSOR SAYING QUITE, WE HAD A  DALAI LAMA FOR ALMOST 5 CENTURIES.  THE DALAI LAMA NOW IS VERY POPULAR. LET US THEN FINISH WITH A POPULAR DALAI LAMA. BOOM! LAMA OUT. HE THEN DROPPED THE KARMA AND WALKED OFF STAGE. SO --  (APPLAUSE) LOOKS LIKE HE'S DOING BUDDHA KARATE. I WILL NOT HIT YOU. SO IT LOOKS LIKE TIBETAN BUDDHISTS MAY NOT BE GETTING A 15th DALAI LAMA, WHICH IS A SHAME, THEY ARE ONLY ONE LAMA AWAY FROM GETTING A FREE MEATBALL SUB. SUBWAY, LIFE IS SUFFERING. APPARENTLY, THE OLD DL WANTS TO GO OUT ON TOP. HE CLAIMS IF A WEAK DALAI LAMA COMES ALONG, THEN IT WILL THEN JUST DISGRACE THE DALAI LAMA. YEAH, I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU GOTTA QUIT WHEN YOU'RE AHEAD.  I MEAN, WE USED TO HAVE A GREAT PRESIDENT, THEN WE HAD TO GET ONE MORE AND ENDED UP WITH THIS GUY. WHO IS PROBABLY A SECRET BUDDHIST WHAT WITH ALL THE MEDITATION HE DOES BETWEEN WORDS.
AMERICA CANNOT WAIT FOREVER --- FOR THEM TO ACT. (LAUGHTER) NOW , FOLKS. OF COURSE ONCE AGAIN THE D-LAM IS JUST PLAYING POLITICS HERE, 'CAUSE HE FEARS THAT CHINA WILL SPLIT TIBETAN BUDDHISM WITH ONE NEW DALAI LAMA NAMED BY EXILS  AND ONE BY CHINA AFTER HIS DEATH. THAT'S RIGHT, DOUBLE LAMA DRAMA. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THEY'RE PICKED, BUT IF IT IS ANYTHING LIKE THE POPE AND THEY RELEASE WHITE SMOKE, I'M PRETTY SURE CHINA HAS BEEN PICKING THEIR LAMA FOR YEARS. SO WITH THE TIBETAN--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO WITH THE TIBETAN PEOPLE AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AT ODDS OVER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR TO TIBETAN LEADERSHIP, THERE'S ONLY ONE SOLUTION. I WILL BE THE 15th DALAI LAMA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN IT'S, IT'S WIN-WIN. I MEAN HEY, BEIJING, I'M WILLING TO PLAY BALL HERE, OKAY. I BELIEVE TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF CHINA, EVER SINCE YOU GUYS PROVED IT WAS WITH ALL THOSE GUNS. AND FOR ALL YOU TIBETANS OUT THERE WATCHING, SURE THIS DALAI LAMA SPENT THE LAST HALF CENTURY SPREADING THE MESSAGE OF A FREE DEMOCRATIC TIBET, SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT AND BAGGING HIMSELF A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE ACHIEVED NOTHING. DOESN'T THAT REALLY MAKE ME THE BETTER BUDDHIST? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OF COURSE, FOLKS, WE ALL KNOW THE WORLD IS TOO COMPLICATED TO SEE IN BLACK AND WHITE.  THAT'S WHY I SEE IT IN TIP AND WAG. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (GONG) FIRST UP, FOLKS, I AM A JUNKIE FOR ALL THINGS SPACE.  SO I WAS ON ORP COUD NINE WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS.
NASA ASTRONAUT WILL GET QUITE THE SWEET DEAL AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. BARRY WILMORE IS HEADED THERE FOR SIX MONTHS ON SEPTEMBER 25th.
ASTRONAUT BARRY WILMORE ASKED NASA, COULD YOU GET ME THE NEW SEC NETWORK IN SPACE? THEY DID IT. HE'LL GET TO WATCH COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, ASTRONAUT BARRY WILMORE CONVINCED NASA TO GET HIM COLLEGE FOOTBALL FOR THE SIX MONTHS HE'S ON THE SPACE STATION. AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOING GET RECEPTION BECAUSE HE'S ONLY ABOUT 40 FEET FROM THE SATELLITE. (LAUGHTER) AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT AN ASTRONAUGHT WOULD WANT TO WATCH FOOTBALL ON TV IN ORBIT, OTHERWISE THERE IS NOTHING TO DO BUT GAZE AT THE MIRACLE OF GOD'S CREATION. SO TONIGHT I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO NASA FOR OUT  MAN-CAVING EVERY OTHER SPORTS FAN ON EARTH.  COME ON! OUR PIMPED OUT-- OUR PIMPED OUT TESTOSTER-ROOMS THIS IS HOW WE MEASURE OUR WORTH AS MEN. I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD SET UP WITH MY 80 INCH FLAT SCREEN,  HASHMARKED CARPET, MY FRAMED PHOTO OF THE GUY FROM THE  NUTRISYSTEM  COMMERCIALS. THESE SHOW THE WORLD I WILL SPARE NO EXPENSE ON MY GREATEST PASSION, SCREAMING OBSCENITIES AT ATHLETES WHO CANNOT HEAR ME. BUT NOW NASA HAS GONE WHERE NO MAN CAVE HAS GONE BEFORE. OH, SOME GUY, THOUGHT HE WAS A BIG SHOT WHEN HE DROPPED $2 MILLION CONVERTING HIS BASEMENT INTO THE BAT CAVE. YOU'RE ADORABLE. TRY $150 BILLION OVER 16 YEARS AND IT'S STILL NOT DONE. THEY'RE WAITING ON THE RUSSKIES TO DELIVER THE BUDWEISER BILLIARD LAMP. NASA'S ORBITAL BRO-PIT HERE HAS IT ALL. IT'S GOT FLOOR TO CEILING TO CEILING ELECTRONICS, IT'S GOT ZERO-G RECLINERS, AND  ASTRONAUT BARRY CAN DRINK ALL THE BEER HE WANTS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM BREAK  BECAUSE CAN JUST ME INTO A VACUUM TUBE. ALTHOUGH, ALTHOUGH, FULL DISCLOSURE, I HAVE DONE THAT ON EARTH. NEXT UP, NEXT UP, NATION, AS A CELEBRITY WHO HAS EARNED YOUR TRUST BY BEING FAMOUS, I WORK HARD TO PROTECT MY PERSONAL BRAND. I SIMPLY CAN'T LET MY NAME BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW QUALITY PRODUCTS. I MEAN, SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT STEPHEN COLBERT'S RAZOR SLINKY. BUT IT WAS MADE FROM THE HIGHEST QUALITY RIBBON BLADE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO DISCRIMINATING BRANDING, MY HERO IS DONALD TRUMP OR THE TRUMPEL. HE LENDS HIS NAME ONLY TO A SELECT FEW LUXURIOUS PRODUCTS. SUITS, SHIRTS, NECK WARE, EYEWEAR, LEATHER GOODS, LIGHTING, MATTRESSES, BOOKS, CHOCOLATE, WATER, COLOGNE, MIRRORS. THOUGH IT IS SHOCKING THAT TRUMP WOULD LET A MIRROR OUT OF HIS SIGHT. SO PERSONALLY I LOVE HIS LATEST POWER MOVE.
DONALD TRUMP IS SUING THE TRUMP TAJ MAHAL AND TRUMP PLAZA IN ATLANTIC CITY TO STOP USING HIS NAME. HE SAYS THEIR POOR CONDITION IS HURTING HIS PERSONAL BRAND.
IN A LAWSUIT FILED TUESDAY THE BILLIONAIRE ACCUSED TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS OF VIOLATING ITS LICENSING AGREEMENT BY ALLOWING THE TRUMP TAJ MAHAL AND TRUMP PLAZA TO FALL INTO AN UTTER STATE OF DISREPAIR. THE SUIT ALSO PONTS TO NEGATIVE ON-LINE REVIEWS FROM CUSTOMERS CALLING BOTH PROPERTIES A TRUMP DUMP.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. A TRUMP DUMP. THAT'S AN INSULT AND A TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT. TRUMP DUMP IS ALREADY LICENCED TO DONALD'S LINE OF LUXURY STOOL SOFTENERS. GUARANTEED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE CLASSIEST, MOST MAGNIFICENT PLATINUM GRADE VELVETY TOP SHELF DOO-DOO POSSIBLE. SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF THE FINGER TO THESE CASINOS FOR TAKING THE TRUMP NAME IN VAIN. THEY CAN'T BLAME THESE SUBTRUMP CONDITIONS ON DONALD. HE HASN'T HAD ANY REAL ROLE IN THESE CASINOS SINCE RESIGNING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD IN 2009 WHEN HIS GAMBLING COMPANY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY FOR THE THIRD TIME. NOT HIS FAULT. IT IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE MONEY IN THE GAMBLING BUSINESS. YOU SEE, DONALD TRUMP, HOLD ON, THIS JUST IN OVER THE TRUMP NEWSWIRE! (APPLAUSE) OH, HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO. OH NO! OH NO, YESTERDAY TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AGAIN. OH MY GOSH. OH MY GOSH. JUST SO, SO TRAGIC. (LAUGHTER) (TOILET FLUSHING) FOLKS -- (TOILET NOISES) I'M JUST GLAD DONALD TRUMP IS NO LONGER CONNECTED WITH THESE TERRIBLE BRANDS. HE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THE NAME TRUMP WITH SHABBY, OSTENTATIOUS HUSKS THAT HAVE CRUMBLED INTO PARODIES OF THEMSELVES. SURE BACK IN THE 80 EASE THEY HAD A MOMENT OF RESPECTABILITY BUT NOW THEY'RE WAY PAST THEIR PRIME. GETTING BY ON THEIR NAME AND APPEALING ONLY TO THE CONFUSED AND THE ELDERLY. BUT THERE IS JUST SO MUCH YOU CAN DO WITH A COLOURFUL PAINT JOB AND A WEIRD GOLDEN ROOF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
