Stephen: WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. BUT BEFORE WE GO, I JUST WANT TO TAKE ONE LAST OPPORTUNITY TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND P.K. WINSOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS.
MY PLEASURE.
Stephen: MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME YOU'RE EVER ON THE SHOW BECAUSE IT'S ENDING THIS YEAR. YOU MIND IF I ASK, P.K., BEFORE WE GO, WHAT DOES P.K. STAND FOR?
IT STANDS FOR PERCY KITTENS.
Stephen: THANK YOU, PERCY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
