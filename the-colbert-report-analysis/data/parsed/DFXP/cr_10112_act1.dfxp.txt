Stephen: TONIGHT, OBAMA MAKES A HUGE OVERREACH ON CLIMATE CHANGE. GET READY FOR GOVERNMENT-MANDATED SUN BONNETS. (LAUGHTER) THEN A NEW THREAT TO OUR SENIOR CITIZENS. TIME CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUEST TONIGHT IS MORGAN FREEMAN, HOST OF "THROUGH THE WORMHOLE" ON THE SCIENCE CHANNEL. I'M STILL ON SEASON ONE, SO NO SPOILERS ON HOW THE UNIVERSE ENDS. (LAUGHTER) THIS WEEK MARKS THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF TIANANMEN SQUARE -- OR AS THEY CALL IT IN CHINA, TANK MAN HAPPY DAY. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS THE "THE COLBERT REPORT"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE REPORT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THAT WAS A FIRST! THAT WAS A FIRST! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! I'VE GOT TO SAY, YOUR ENTHUSIASM TONIGHT, WHAT YOU JUST DID ALMOST LED TO A FIRST ON THE SHOW! I ALMOST STARTED CHANTING "STEPHEN, STEPHEN" MYSELF, BUT THEN I CAUGHT MYSELF (CHEERING) I ONLY DO THAT WHEN I'M SHAVING IN THE MORNING. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THERE'S NO BIGGER DEFENDER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT THAN FACEY-FACE RIGHT HERE. (LAUGHTER) I'VE ALWAYS SAID, THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST A BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY HOARDING GUNS IN A BACKWOODS SHACK MUTTERING TO HIMSELF ABOUT THE COMING RACE WAR. WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORT THE OPEN-CARRY MOVEMENT, WHERE PATRIOTS STAND UP FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT BY PROUDLY DISPLAYING THEIR GUNS IN PUBLIC PLACES, LIKE A PATRIOT FEST LAST MONTH WHERE THESE TWO BUDDIES POSTED PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES WITH THEIR GUNS AT A CHIPOTLE. (LAUGHTER) THEY WERE TELLING THE WORLD THEY'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THEIR GUN LOVE. THEY ARE OUT AND THEY ARE PROUD. "WE'RE HERE, WE'VE GOT GEAR, GET USED TO IT." (LAUGHTER) BUT I'M SO SAD TO REPORT THAT THE RESPONSE TO THIS CHIPOTLE CHIPROTEST WAS FOR CHIPOTLE AND A WHOLE SLOUGH OF OTHER RESTAURANTS TO OPPRESS GUN LOVERS.
CHIPOTLE IS ASKING CUSTOMERS NOT TO BRING GUNS INTO ITS RESTAURANTS.
MORE RESTAURANTS ARE JUMPING ON THE NO-GUNS-ALLOWED BANDWAGON. SONIC AND CHILI'S TELLING CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE THEIR GUNS AT HOME. GUNS ALSO NOT WELCOME AT STARBUCKS, WENDY'S, JACK IN THE BOX AND APPLEBEE'S.
LOOK AT THAT, IT'S A DOMINO EFFECT. OH GOD, I JUST HOPE THIS DOESN'T SPREAD TO DOMINOES! (LAUGHTER) I LIKE TO HAVE A GUN ON HAND AFTER I EAT ONE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE KILLING MYSELF. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NATION, THESE RESTAURANTS ARE FORCING PATRIOTS TO MAKE THE HARDEST CHOICE ANY AMERICAN CAN FACE -- BETWEEN HIGH-POWERED WEAPONRY AND FRIED FOOD. BOTH ARE DEADLY, BUT ONLY ONE  COMES WITH MELTED CHEESE. AND IT'S ALREADY BECOMING A WEDGE ISSUE. A WEDGE OF CHEESE ISSUE. BECAUSE NOW OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK BY THE LIBERAL WHACKOS AT THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION, WHO ON THEIR WEBSITE SLANDERED THESE GOOD MEN, SAYING... WELL, A 7.62 IS WEIRD. WHY WOULD YOU WEAR A 7.62 AFTER MEMORIAL DAY? IT'S SUMMER. YOU WANNA WEAR SOMETHING MORE LIGHT, MORE KICKY. MAYBE AN UZI WITH A FOLDING STOCK. YOU KNOW, FUN. (LAUGHTER) SOMETHING THAT SAYS "I'M READY FOR THE BEACH, AND IF THE RIGHT GUY COMES ALONG, A FIREFIGHT." BUT BY NOT UNCONDITIONALLY SUPPORTING THESE MEN, THE N.R.A. IS STABBING ALL GUN LOVERS IN THE BACK, WHEN IT SHOULD BE SHOOTING US IN THE FRONT. THAT'S WHY THE ORGANIZATION BEHIND THE CHIPOTLE PHOTOS OPEN-CARRY TEXAS IS FIRING BACK. ON THEIR Facebook SITE, THEY CHALLENGED THE N.R.A. SAYING, "IF THEY DO NOT RETRACT THEIR DISGUSTING AND DISRESPECTFUL COMMENTS, O.C.T. WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO WITHDRAW ITS FULL SUPPORT OF THE N.R.A. AND ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER GUN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT FIGHT FOR ALL GUN RIGHTS." YES, ALL GUN RIGHTS. DO YOU KNOW SOME GUNS AREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO VOTE? (LAUGHTER) AND O.C.T. HAS PLENTY OF OTHER PRO-GUN GROUPS TO JOIN LIKE "TEXAS CARRY," "GUN RIGHTS ACROSS AMERICA," AND "COME AND TAKE IT TEXAS." (LAUGHTER)    GREAT GROUP, BY THE WAY... DON'T TRY TO "COME AND TAKE IT." NATION, I'VE LONG WARNED YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GLOBAL WARMING. MELTING ICE CAPS, RISING SEAS, REUSABLE GROCERY BAGS. (LAUGHTER) NOW WHAT'S GONNA GET CAUGHT IN TREES? AND FOLKS, YESTERDAY, AMERICA GOT ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE  NIGHTMARE SCENARIO OF DOING SOMETHING. JIM?
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCING STRICT NEW STANDARDS FOR CARBON EMISSIONS.
PROPOSING NEW E.P.A. REGULATIONS TO TAKE HIS STRONGEST ACTION YET AGAINST  CLIMATE CHANGE.
IT'S VERY MUCH SORT OF OBAMACARE FOR THE AIR.
Stephen: YES, OBAMACARE FOR THE AIR! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS: GET READY FOR BREATH PANELS. (LAUGHTER) THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD REQUIRE STATES TO CUT CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM COAL PLANTS 30% BY 2030. THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S GOING TO BE A 2030. NO SURPRISE, THE LIBERAL MEDIA LOVED THIS MORE EVEN THAN THEY LOVE BARBARA STREISAND'S GLUTEN-FREE QUINOA WINTER SOLSTICE DRUM CIRCLE CLEANSE. (LAUGHTER) CHRIS HAYES?
TODAY, HISTORICALLY SPEAKING, HAS A CHANCE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA, AND TODAY'S HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS WHY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EFFORT BY ANY AMERICAN PRESIDENT EVER TO CURB CARBON EMISSIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.
Stephen: YES, IT'S THE "MOST SIGNIFICANT" EFFORT ANY PRESIDENT HAS EVER TAKEN TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING. SECOND PLACE OF COURSE IS A 43-WAY TIE FOR NOTHING. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) PURELY PLATONIC. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOLKS, OBAMA CLAIMS HE'S DOING THIS TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS REALLY IS.
OBAMA HAS MADE NO SECRET THAT HE HATES COAL AND HE WANTS TO DESTROY THAT INDUSTRY.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 30%, THAT PROBABLY MEANS WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF SWITCHING FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS.
WE COULD SEE MANY AS HALF OF EXISTING COAL-FIRED PLANTS RETIRED.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WAR ON COAL.
THE WAR ON COAL. WAR ON COAL...
Stephen: YES, OBAMA'S LAUNCHED A WAR ON COAL! IT'S THE MOST VICIOUS ATTACK ON AN IRREPLACEABLE FUEL SOURCE SINCE JAMES K. POLK'S "BLITZKRIEG ON KINDLING." (LAUGHTER) WHAT ON EARTH IS OBAMA THINKING? COAL GENERATES 40% OF AMERICA'S ELECTRICITY. THE REST COMES FROM TRADITIONAL SOURCES LIKE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND RADIO SHACK PLASMA BALLS. (LAUGHTER) WE'VE CAGED THE LIGHTNING! WE CANNOT LOSE THE COAL INDUSTRY. WHAT WILL WE GIVE TO NAUGHTY KIDS ON CHRISTMAS? A STOCKING FULL OF WIND? COME ON... (LAUGHTER) SO THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE REASON TO SUPPORT THESE NEW REGULATIONS. HERE TO GIVE ME MULTIPLE REASONS TO SUPPORT THESE NEW REGULATIONS, PLEASE WELCOME YALE PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND POLICY, AND THE FORMER COMMISSIONER OF THE CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, DAN ESTY! DAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DAN! WHY ON EARTH? YOU EXPLAIN TO ME, MR. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES YALE SMARTY PANTS, WHY IS OBAMA DECLARING WAR ON COAL AND IS HE GOING TO DRAW THE TROOPS OUT OF AFGHANISTAN AND SEND THEM STRAIGHT INTO WEST VIRGINIA?
STEPHEN, I'M AFRAID TO TELL YOU THERE'S NO WAR.
Stephen: WAR ON COAL. NO WAR ON COAL.
Stephen: IT'S A MODEST FIRST STEP. IT'S A POLICE ACTION AGAINST COAL. LIKE KENNEDY TOOK A MODEST STEP IN VIETNAM.
HE'S DONE COMMON SENSE THINGS TO BEGIN A TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE.
Stephen: WHY NOT CLEAN COAL, IT HAS THE WORD CLEAN IN IT, YOU'VE GOTTA ADMIT THAT.
IT COULD BE WE WILL HAVE CLEAN COAL BUT WE NEED A BROADER PORTFOLIO AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SHIFT TOWARD CHEAPER AND CLEANER NATURAL GAS IN A PRETTY BIG WAY.
Stephen: SO YOU ENVIRONMENTAL TYPES ARE ALL FOR FRACKING, SHATTERING THE BEDROCK WITH A SLURRY OF UNKNOWN CHEMICALS.
THERE IS NEED FOR REGULATIONS --
Stephen: HERE WE GO, REGULATIONS. WON'T REGULATIONS AND CLOSING THE COAL PLANTS, WON'T THAT COST AMERICAN JOBS?
NOT NECESSARILY. THERE WILL BE SOME TRANSITION.
Stephen: YEAH? THERE IS ALSO A HUGE POTENTIAL -- IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE DID IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, WHERE WE'VE BEGUN THE TRANSITION, RAMPING UP RENEWABLE ENERGY, SOLAR, WIND AND A VARIETY OF --
Stephen: THE SUN SHINES IN CONNECTICUT?
THE BIGGEST SOLAR POWER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS GERMANY, WHICH IS LESS SUNNY THAN CONNECTICUT. SO THERE ARE PLACES THAT MADE THIS TRANSITION BEGIN TO HAPPEN AND YOU'RE SEEING JOB GROWTH IN DEPLOYMENT OF THE RENEWABLE RESOURCES, DELIVERING ENERGY FOR EVERY HOUSE AND IT'S LOWER COST AND GREATER COMPETITIVENESS.
Stephen: BUT IN THE MEANTIME, TILL WE GET THERE, THERE ARE GONNA BE SOME JOBS LOST.
SOME TRANSITION.
Stephen: TRANSITION? TRANSITION.
Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE TRANSITION BREAD LINES? (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, IF THERE WERE REALLY A SERIOUS EFFORT TO MAKE THIS WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY, YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO INVEST IN WEST VIRGINIA AS A RESEARCH CENTER FOR WIND POWER, SOLAR POWER AND SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
Stephen: OBAMA IS LETTING EVERY STATE DO THIS IN THEIR OWN WAY. THERE'S A STANDARD BUT EVERY STATE GETS TO SET UP THEIR OWN CARBON EXCHANGES OR WHATEVER THEY WANT.
THAT'S A GOOD STRATEGY --
Stephen: BECAUSE POLLUTION STAYS IN A PARTICULAR STATE? IT DOESN'T GO FROM STATE TO STATE?
FLOWS STATE TO STATE AND GLOBAL WARMING. THE GREENHOUSE GASES  BLANKET THE EARTH SO THERE'S A NEED TO GET A GLOBAL PICTURE OF THIS TAKEN CARE OF. YOU START IN EACH COUNTRY BUT TO GET IT ON THE GROUND, STATE LEVEL ACTION MAKES SENSE.
Stephen: YOU SCIENCE PEOPLE PUT YOUR FAITH IN GLOBAL WARMING. YOU TELL ME WHEN I BREATHE OUT I'M BREATHING OUT CO2. SO DO I HAVE TO BREATHE 30% LESS BY 2030, OR CAN I DO CARBON OFFSETS BY SMOTHERING A POOR PERSON WITH A PILLOW? (LAUGHTER) IT'S OKAY! OBAMA WANTS ME TO! HOLD STILL! OBAMA WANTS ME TO!
I THINK THERE WILL BE ALTERNATIVES TO THE PILLOW  SMOTHERING TECHNIQUE.
Stephen: WE'LL WAIT AND SEE. DAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME (APPLAUSE) DAN ESTY, YALE UNIVERSITY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
