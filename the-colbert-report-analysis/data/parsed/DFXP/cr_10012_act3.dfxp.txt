WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT THE BRRB ACKER, PLAYWRIGHT, JOURNALIST, POET, COMEDIAN, TELEVISION HOST, ACTIVIST, TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER AND SPY, PLEASE WELCOME STEPHEN FRY.
HEY, STEPHEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. NICE TO SEE YOU.
VERY NICE TO BE SEEN BY YOU.
AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE BOTH ON THE SET OF THE HOBBIT.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
YEAH. AND YOUR AUDIENCE, MAY NOT BE AWARE OF YOUR ABSOLUTE, PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THINGS TOLKIEN.
I TRY TO REMIND THEM AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. MR. COLBERT AND HIS FAMILY CAME TO WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND WHILE WE WERE FILMING THE HOBBIT. WE CREATED THIS LITTLE QUIZ, AND STEPHEN WAS PITTED AGAINST THE TOLKIEN EXPERT WHO IS BEHIND THE SCRIPT. AND FEW PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT TOLKIEN. AND TOLKIEN WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH ABOUT TOLKIEN. AND THERE AT ONE END WAS MR. COLBERT. AND THERE AT THE OTHER END WAS-- AND STEPHEN WON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU CHEER.
YES, THEY DO CHEER.
YOU CHEER BUT DO THINK OF THE IMPLICATION. BETWEEN THE AGES OF 13 AND 17 HE PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD A PENIS. YOU WERE JUST LOCKED IN A TRAGIC WORLD OF WALKING TREES.
NO, NO, I HAD ONE, I HAD A GOLDEN RING ON IT. (LAUGHTER)
VERY GOOD.
AND I NEVER WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN. NOW OKAY, AS I SAID BEFORE, YOU'RE AN ACTOR, SCREENWRITER, BEST SELLING AUTHOR, PLAYWRIGHT, ACTIVIST, YOU'RE A POOR MAN'S JAMES FRANCO.
BUT I KNOW MY LIMBS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, AND THANK YOU FOR BEING SO VERY ENGLISH RIGHT NOW.
YES. I AM RATHER, NOT DELIBERATELY. TWEED.
NOTHING MATCHES, IT'S PERFECT. NOW YOU'RE IN 12th NIGHT RIGHT NOW ON BROADWAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU ARE PLAYING THE CHARACTER OF MALVOLIO.
YES.
Stephen: HE'S THE HERO OF THAT PLAY, ISN'T HE.
OF COURSE HE IS, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: BECAUSE HE IS THE FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIAN WHO IS TELLING EVERYONE TO STOP HAVING FUN.
EXACTLY RIGHT. HE BURSTS IN ON A PARTY, AND HE TELLS THEM ALL TO GO TO BED. AND YOU MAKING AN ALE HOUSE OF THE HOUSE. AND IT SEEMS TO ME HE IS IS THE HERO. UNFORTUNATELY HE IS MADE A FOOL OF BY THE REALLY UNPLEASANT PEOPLE. I'M PLANNING TO WRITE A SEQUEL CALLED 13th NIGHT. MALVOLIO'S REVENGE BECAUSE HE SLAUGHTERS THEM.
Stephen: IN A AM BIG PEN TAMM TER.
FORTUNATELY FOR ME, IT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY IN PROCEEDS SO I DON'T HAVE TO DO-- .
Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO-- OKAY.
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE THING THAT I, ONE THING I FIND SUSPICIOUS ABOUT YOU, IS THAT WHILE I LIKE YOU AS AN ACTOR, MOST ACTORS WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY SMART. THEY JUST PLAY SMART PEOPLE. YOU ACTUALLY SEEM LIKE A SMART PERSON AND I FIND THAT SUSPICIOUS.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
Stephen: WHY DOW VALUE INTELLIGENCE SO MUCH.
I KNOW, IT'S SO MUCH AGAINST THE GRAIN OF REPUBLICANISM IN AMERICA  TO-- HAVE A BRAIN AND-- .
Stephen: MORE OF THIS, MORE OF THIS.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO AN ATHEIST.
I AM AN ATHEIST.
Stephen: YES, YOU ARE VERY MUCH AN ATHEIST, DON'T WORRY, YOU DONE HAVE TO CHEER, I'LL GET HIM.
I HAVE NO OBJECTION OF PEOPLE AND THEIR INVISIBLE FRIEND TO TALK.
Stephen: S THIS'S VERY GENEROUS OF YOU. THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF A MAN WHO HAS THE DEVIL'S BEARD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOOK IN THE CAMERA AND APOLOGIZE TO SANTA CLAUS RIGHT NOW?
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS, BUT IT IS RATHER SWEET WHEN YOU THINK OF, ALL THE WORLD'S RELIGEONS ARE VERY INTERESTING.
Stephen: SOME OF THEM ARE MORE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE TRUE.
WELL,.
Stephen: YES, YES, ALL RECIPES ARE INTERESTING. SOME WILL KILL, SOME ARE DELICIOUS.
ONLY ONE MIGHT BE TRUE AND ALL THESE OTHER PIOS PEOPLE LIVING ARE ALL GOING TO BURN IN HELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FOLD THE RIGHT ONE. BUT IN JAPAN WHERE CHRISTIANITY IS NOT, YOU KNOW, THE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE THE COMMON THOUGHT IS A FRIEND OF MINE WAS LOOKING AT CHRISTMASTIME AND HE SAW SANTA CLAUS NAILED TO A CROSS. THAT WAS THERE IDEA CHRISTIANITY, YEAH, WE HAVE FATHER CHRISTMAS AND A CROSS, YEAH, THAT'S IT, YEAH. I THINK.
Stephen: WHY NOT.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY ALSO, YOU HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF PRAISE FOR BEING VERY OPEN ABOUT YOUR BIPOLAR DISORDER.
YES, YES.
Stephen: THAT MUST EITHER MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY OR VERY SAD. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: IS THAT WHY YOU SPEAK OPENLY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.
I'M GAY AS WELL BECAUSE-- .
Stephen: I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T --
OH.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT.
WELL DONE, NEW JERSEY, BY THE WAY. AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU JUST DISAPPOINTED A LOT OF LADIES MY FRIEND.
I'M SO SORRY. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PLUGGING ALSO SING MAY I'M DOING WITH SUSAN SARANDON. VERY MUCH ON YOUR LEVEL POLITICALLY I KNOW. CALLED IT GETS BETTER. I THINK --.
Stephen: I KNOW IT GETS BETTER.
WITHOUT GETTING-- WITHOUT DELVING INTO TOO MUCH SENTIMENT, THE FACT THAT THERE AREN'T TOO MANY TEENAGE SUICIDES, IT'S TOO MUCH TOREMENT BY FACEBOOK OR TWITTER ON GAY TEENAGERS AND IT BECOMES AND BEHOOVES SOMEBODY WHO IS CONFIDENT IN THEIR SEXUALITY TO SHARE S SO PEOPLE LIKE THAT CAN FOR EXAMPLE, I THINK DESERVE A ENORMOUS SPER SPECKIVE. -- WHY CAN'T ANYBODY BE GAY WITHOUT BEING TOREMENTED AND TEASED. PEOPLE LOOK BACK IN 100 YEARS TIME THEY WILL SAY WAS THERE REALLY A MOMENT WHEN PEOPLE WERE-- HAD SO LITTLE TO DISLEAK THAT THEY CHOSE THE WAY PEOPLE LOVE AS WHAT THEY HATED.
Stephen: I AGREE WITH YOU.  IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPLAIN TO OUR GRANDCHILDREN WHY WE ARE DENYING GAY PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO VOTE BUT THE RIGHT THING ISN'T ALWAYS EASY. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU KNOW.
YOU AND I, YOU AND I HAD GREAT GRANDPARENTS WHO OFFICERED SUGAR INTO COFFEE KNOWING THAT EACH HAD BEEN PICKED BY A SLAVE. AND WE PROBABLY DON'T LIKE TO THINK OF OUR GREAT GREAT GRANDPARENTS OF BEING WICKED PEOPLE. THEY PROBABLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOD FEARING PEOPLE AND CERTAINLY WENT TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY. AND YET THEY QUITE HAPPILY STIRRED THEIR SUGAR INTO THEIR COFFEE. IT'S A MORAL CHANGE.
Stephen: ARE YOU ENGLISH. AND I'M IRISH SO MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS KNEW YOUR GREAT GRANTS WHERE WICKED PEOPLE. YOU MENTIONED TWITTER. YOU HAVE 6 MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS.
YES, 6 AND A QUARTER.
Stephen: AND CHANGING I HAVE ONLY 5.4. BUT YOURS ARE METRIC, RIGHT? SO I MIGHT HAVE-- I WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE YOU TO SOMETHING.
OKAY.
Stephen: DO YOU DO THAT RIGHT NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE YOU, LET ME OPEN UP HERE WITH MY OLD MAGIC THUMB PRINT.
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO TRAINED IT TO OPEN WITH HIS NIPPLE.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: HIS NIPPLE, HIS NIPPLE. OKAY THERE YOU GO. OKAY, I WILL TWEET, WHO CAN GET THE MORE RETWEETS?
