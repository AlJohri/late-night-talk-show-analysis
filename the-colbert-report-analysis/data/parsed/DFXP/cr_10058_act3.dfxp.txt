(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, I'M HERE WITH PUSSY RIOT AND OUR TRANSLATOR, MASHA, NADYA AND ANYA, THE TRANSLATOR. YOU WERE RELEASED FROM JAIL. UM. WHY? (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE CRIMINALS. YOU'RE DANGEROUS CRIMINALS WHO SING IN CHURCHES. WHY WERE YOU RELEASED?
( translated ): THEY GOT FED UP WITH US.
Stephen: PUTIN?
( translated ): IT WAS MOSTLY THE PRISON ADMINISTRATORS BUT ALSO PUTIN WHO THEY HAD TO REPORT TO ABOUT EVERYTHING.
Stephen: SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO VLADIMIR PUTIN FOR RELEASING ME FROM JAIL? I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.
( translated ): WE'D MUCH RATHER THANK THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PUTIN WHO SUPPORTED US AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE IN PARTICULAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >>Stephen: WELL, I APPLAUD YOU TOO.  I APPLAUD YOU TOO.  I APPLAUD YOU TOO. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RUSSIAN WORD FOR "PANDER" IS BUT -- (LAUGHTER) WELL DONE. OK, YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE ONLY RELEASED AS A PUBLIC RELATIONS STUNT FOR THE SOCHI OLYMPIC GAMES. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE?
( translated ): WELL, I DON'T THINK --.
Stephen: I GOT THAT ONE. I GOT THIS ONE. I KNOW JUST WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I'M SORRY, GO AHEAD.
( translated ): WE DON'T THINK IT WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL POLITICAL-- WE DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY IMPROVED THE IMAGE OF RUSSIA SO MAYBE PUTIN MADE A MISTAKE AND HE SHOULD JUST THROW US BACK IN JAIL. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: I WOULDN'T TEMPT  HIM. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: I WOULDN'T TEMPT  HIM.
( translated ): WE'D MUCH RATHER WORK ON FREEING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL IN JAIL WHO GOT ARRESTED IN THE SQUARE ON MAY 6 FOR STANDING UP FOR FREEDOM AND THERE ARE 12 PEOPLE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW FOR THIS WITH TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO SIX YEARS. AND WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING, NO P.R. STUNT CAN FIX RUSSIA'S IMAGE.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE UNITED STATES?
( translated ): WE'VE COME HERE TO LOOK AT AMERICAN PRISONS TO TALK TO HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, AND TO LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. WELL I'M NOT SURPRISED YOU'RE TOURING AMERICAN PRISONS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL HERE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL HERE. (LAUGHTER)
( translated ): ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. WE LOOK LOOKED AT SOME PRISONS IN THE NETHERLANDS AND THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, BUT THERE'S SUCH A GIANT GAP BETWEEN THEIR WONDERFUL PRISONS AND OUR TERRIBLE PRISONS.
Stephen: I THINK ALL THE PRISONS IN THE NETHERLANDS ACTUALLY GET TO SMOKE POT. (LAUGHTER) SO PEOPLE HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME WHILE THEY'RE IN THERE.
( translated ): YEAH, WE HAD A GREAT TIME THERE, TOO. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ARE YOU AFRAID OF BEING THROWN BACK IN JAIL?
( translated ): NO, I MEAN, WE JUST OFFERED. IF YOU WANT TO THROW US BACK IN JAIL, GO AHEAD. YOU SHOULD TALK TO VLADIMIR PUTIN.
Stephen: I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL. YOU WANT ME TO PUT A GOOD WORD IN FOR YOU? ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY MEMBERS OF PUSSY RIOT ARE THERE?
( translated ): IT'S A BIG SECRET. WE CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT YOU NEED TO FIND PEOPLE IN MASKS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT PUSSY RIOT.
Stephen: CAN ANYONE BE IN PUSSY RIOT?
( translated ): OF COURSE.
Stephen: CAN AMERICANS?
Stephen: WHAT?
( translated ): EVEN YOU.
Stephen: I COULD BE IN PUSSY RIOT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOULD I KNOW IT? (LAUGHTER)
( translated ): WE COULD EVEN COME UP WITH AN HONORARY PUSSY RIOT MEMBER TRADITION PROCEDURE FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
( translated ): BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS ONLY AFTER YOU CALL PUTIN. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL TALK TO HIM OVER THE CAMERA, HOW ABOUT THAT?   AT THE END OF THE SHOW.
( translated ): OKAY.
Stephen: IT'S A DEAL? WHY DO YOU CALL YOURSELVES PUSSY RIOT? AND YOU DON'T EVEN SAY IT IN RUSSIAN. YOU SAY IT IN ENGLISH, RIGHT? THE NAME OF THE BAND IS PUSSY RIOT IN ENGLISH, RIGHT?
Stephen: WE WANTED TO LET ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLE ENJOY THEMSELVES. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE DO. WE DO, THANK  YOU VERY MUCH. THERE IS A WORD FOR IN THE RUSSIAN, RIGHT?
