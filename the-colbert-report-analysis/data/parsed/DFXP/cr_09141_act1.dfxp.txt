Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT. THANK YOU, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN,  STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO  MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOLKS, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WE  ARE STILL-- IF YOU KNOW  ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEWS BUSINESS, FOLKS, AUGUST IS  NOTORIOUSLY A SLOW NEWS  MONTH. WHO CAN FORGET THE SUMMER OF  '75 WHEN WALTER CRONKITE DID  A TEN PART SERIES ON SPOONS, THE MIDDLE CHILD OF THE  DINNER TABLE. (LAUGHTER)  STILL, EVERY FEW AUGUSTS YOU  GET A STORY SO BIG YOU CAN'T  HELP BUT SINK YOUR TEETH INTO IT. AND TONIGHT I'M PROUD TO SAY  WE HAVE THE LATEST ON THE  GRIPPING STORY OF THE RODEO CLOWN WHO PUT ON AN OBAMA  MASK. (LAUGHTER)  YES, I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW. SOME SAID THE MEDIA WOULD BE  THROWN OFF THIS RODEO STORY  IN A SECOND. (LAUGHTER)  BUT NOBODY, NOBODY RIDES  THIS KIND OF BULL LIKE THE  HEROES OF CABLE NEWS. JIM?
FROM THE STATE FAIR ASKED  THE CROWD IF THEY WANTED TO  SEE A RODEO CLOWN WITH AN OBAMA MASK RUN DOWN BY A  BULL. ANOTHER CLOWN PLAYING WITH  THE OBAMA MASK SLIPS.
A RODEO CLOWN WHO  PERFORMED DURING THE  MISSOURI STATE FAIR WHILE  WEARING A MASK OF PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN BANNED FROM  PERFORMING AT THE MISSOURI  STATE FARE EVER AGAIN.
THE MISSOURI RODEO COWBOY  ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT, HE  ALSO RESIGNED IN THE MIDST OF THIS CLOWN FALLOUT.
THERE IS SOME NEW FALLOUT  OVER THIS WHOLE RODEO CLOWN  ISSUE. THE RODEO ANNOUNCER AT THE  EVENT NOW STEPPING DOWN AS  PRESIDENT OF MISSOURI'S  RODEO COWBOY ASSOCIATION HAS ALL OF THIS GONE WAY TOO  FAR?
Stephen: OH, IT'S GONE  WAY TOO FAR. THE CLOWN'S BEEN FIRED. THE ANNOUNCER RESIGNED. THE COWBOY ASSOCIATION'S  PRESIDENT HAS RESIGNED. AND COUNTLESS BULLS HAVE  BEEN JABBED IN THE GONADS  WITH ELECTRIC CATTLE  PRODUCTS. EXCUSE ME, I'M BEING TOLD  THAT LAST THING IS JUST PART  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT, CARRY  ON. AND FOLKS, THIS STORY GOES  BEYOND THE GIANT POWER  VACUUM ATOP MISSOURI'S RODEO  COWBOY ASSOCIATION. IT'S MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. AND NOBODY ADOES NOTHING  LIKE FOX NEWS DANA PERINO. JIM.
RODEOS, EVERY PRESIDENT  IS ALWAYS MADE FUN OF. THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF  RIDICULE. THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF  ACHIEVEMENT, TO BE MADE FUN  OF BY THE RODEO CLOWN, IS  ACTUALLY SUCCESS. THIS IS A BIG DEAL IF YOU  GET MADE FUN OF BY THE RODEO  CLOWN, YOU HAVE MADE IT.
EXACTLY. I MEAN NOBEL PAEZ PEACE  PRIZE, MEH, FIRST BLACK  PRESIDENT, WHAT ELSE. BUT THERE IS NO HIGHER HONOR  THAN HAVING A CLOWN RUN  AROUND A DIRT ARENA WEARING A GROTESQUE MASK OF YOUR  FACE WHILE THE ANNOUNCER  ASKED THE CHEERING CROWD WHO  WANTS TO SEE THIS GUY  TRAMPLED? AND YES, BARACK OBAMA HAS  NOT THANKED THE RODEO  CLOWNS. I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE  SURPRISED. HE NEVER SEEMED GRATEFUL  WHEN THE TEA PARTY HONORED  HIM WITH THOSE CHARLY  CHAPLIN MUSTACHES. NATION P IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU  KNOW I LOVE BURNING FOSSIL  FUELS. AND SO DOES MY PET LAWN  MOWER. AND THESE DAYS I CAN BURN  CARBON TO MY HEART CONTENT  BECAUSE AMERICA IS ENJOYING A NEW GOLDEN AGE OF FLAMM  ABLE.
THERE ARE 36,000 FRACKING  WELLS IN THIS COUNTRY. THOUSANDS MORE OPEN UP EVERY  YEAR. THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS HAS  DROPPED 86% FROM ITS HIGH IN  2008. WE'RE ACTUALLY ABOUT TO  START EXPORTING IT.
YOU COULD WIPE OUT THE  UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM IN THIS  COUNTRY OVERNIGHT BY  FRACKING.
AN EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY  NOW FOR AMERICA TO EXTRACT  ITS OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND, YOU KNOW, BECOME, YOU KNOW,  ENERGY INDEPENDENT, IT'S  AMAZING, MAZING FOR AMERICA.
Stephen: YES, IT'S  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. ENERGY IS SO CHEAP I CAN  FINALLY ROLIZE MY DREAM OF  MAKING MY FURNACE AND AIR  CONDITIONER FIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  WHO LOVES ME MORE, BOYS. AMERICA HAS FOUND THE GOOSE  THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGG. UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS POOPING  ALL OVER OUR HOUSE.
IT KILLED THE POND. IT KILLED THE FISH. KILLED EVERYTHING IN THE  POND, NO FROGS, NO TURTLES,  NOTHING.
THEY'RE POISONING YOU. AND THEY'RE TELLING YOU  THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT  HAS A PROBLEM.
MY KIDS STARTED GETTING  SICK EARLY ON IN THE DRILL  APPROXIMATING PROCESS. SORT OF LIKE A VERY BAD  INTESTINAL BUG.
THE IMAGE OF WATER  TESTING FIRE IN THE  DOCUMENTARY GASLAND HAS COME  TO SYMBOLIZE THE ANTI-FRACKING MOVEMENT.
NOW SURE, MAYBE YOU CAN'T  WASH YOUR DISHES ANY MORE. BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, NOW  YOU'VE GOT A KILN TO MAKE  NEW ONES. AND COME ON, WE'RE TRYING TO  THROW A FRACKING PARTY HERE  AND THESE PEOPLE ARE RUINING IT WITH THEIR SUFFERING. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S LIKE GOING TO A  BARBECUE AND SEEING A VIDEO  ON FACTORY FARMING. I DON'T WANT TO MEET ALL 400  COWS IN MY BURGER. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FORTUNATELY, FOLKS THERE  IS A WAY WE CAN ENJOY THE  FRUITS OF FRACKING WITHOUT FEELING THE GUILT. AND IT BRINGS US TO  TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GAG GIFTS. FOLKS, I'M A SENSITIVE GUY. I CRIED WHEN THOSE HUNTERS  SHOT BAMBI'S MOTHER. THEY SHOULD HAVE SHOT HIS  DAD. HE IS A 10 POINT BUCK. SO NATURALLY I WAS TOUCHED  WHEN I HEARD ABOUT A FAMILY  LIVING NEAR A PENNSYLVANIA FRACKING SITE WHO HAD TO  MOVE BECAUSE AIR AND WATER  CONTAMINANTS CAUSED THEM TO EXPERIENCE BURNING EYES,  SORE THROATS, HEADACHES AND  EARACHES. ULTIMATELY THE FAMILY WAS  ABLE TO GET THE COMPANY RANG  RESOURCES TO AGREE TO AN OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT FOR  $750,000 TO RELOCATE. WOW. FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY YOU  COULD BUY SOMETHING NICE. NOW IN RETURN, IN RETURN THE  COMPANY SIMPLY ASKED FOR A  SIGNED STATEMENT FROM THE FAMILY SAYING THAT IT  SUFFERED NO ENVIRONMENTAL  HEALTH OR SAFETY IMPACT FROM  DRILLING ADJACENT TO THEIR  PROPERTY. AND TO AGREE TO LIFETIME  BANS ON WHAT THEY CAN SAY. BECAUSE IF A TREE FALLS IN  THE FOREST AND YOU PAY THE  FAMILY WHO HEARD IT NOT TO TALK, THEN IT DIDN'T MAKE A  SOUND. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  NOW-- NO WONDER--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I SAY NO WONDER GAG ORDERS LIKE THIS ARE SO COMMON.
BLOOMBERG REVIEWED  HUNDREDS OF REGULATORY AND  LEGAL FILINGS AND FOUND  DRILLERS PAYING FOR SILENCE OVER WATER CONTAMINATION  COMPLAINTS IN AT LEAST HALF  A DOZEN STATES.
Stephen: THEY'RE  EVERYWHERE, PAYING FOR  SILENCE IS CATCHING ON LIKE  TAP FIRE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FOLKS, THE FUN PART-- THE  FUN PART IS THAT THIS GAG  ORDER ALSO INCLUDED THE FAMILY'S TWO CHILDREN AGES 7  AND 10. IMPORTANT LESSON, KIDS, IF  YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE  TO SAY, DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. BUT EVEN AFTER-- EVEN AFTER  THEY MOVED--   (APPLAUSE)  THESE CRYBABIES ARE CRYING ABOUT THEIR BABIES CLAIMING  THAT IMPOSING A GAG ORDER ON  MINORS VIOLATES THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. BUT JUDGE PAUL POZONSKY WHO  APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT HAD  AN AIRTIGHT REBUTTAL SAYING THAT IS A LAW SCHOOL  QUESTION, I GUESS. JUDGE POZONSKY HAS SINCE  RESIGNED. NOW THE PROBLEM--   (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THE PROBLEM IS  IMPORTANT, I THINK-- BUT THE  PROBLEM WAS ENFORCING A GAG ORDER ON A 7-YEAR-OLD, IS  THAT FOR THE REST OF THEIR  LIVES ANY TIME SOMEONE  BRINGS UP FRACKING, THE KIDS WON'T TALK. BUT THEY'LL HAVE A HAUNTED  LOOK IN THEIR EYES. LIKE WHEN YOU ASK VIETNAM  VETS ABOUT AGENT ORANGE OR  ASK NBC EXECUTIVES ABOUT  DONALD TRUMP. (LAUGHTER)  NOW-- PEOPLE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: PEOPLE MIGHT  START TO SUSPECT THAT THE  KIDS THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH FRACKING. WE NEED SOME WAY TO CHANGE  WHAT THEY THINK. MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE  DRILL INTO THEIR SKULLS AND  INJECT NEW THOUGHTS INTO THEIR BRAINS UNDER EXTREME  ECONOMIC PRESSURE TO SHATTER  THOSE OLD THOUGHTS AND THEN EXTRACT POSITIVE MESSAGES  ABOUT FRACKING. NOW I GUESS-- FOLKS-- I  GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY  IS--   (APPLAUSE)  I THINK, I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS I WISH  THERE WAS A WAY MY CAR COULD  RUN BY BURNING THE INNOCENCE OF CHILDREN. ANYWAY-- YOU KNOW WHAT, IN A  WAY IT KIND OF DOES BECAUSE  THESE COMPANIES ARE JUST ASKING FOR KIDS TO LIE FOR  MONEY. AND IN ORDER TO GET CHEAP  OIL, I THINK WE'RE ALL  WILLING TO LIE TO OURSELVES  ABOUT FRACKING. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
