(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE FIRST FEMALE ANCHOR TEAM IN NATIONAL TELEVISION NEWS. I'D LOVE TO MEET THE MAN WHO HIRED THEM. PLEASE WELCOME JUDY WOODRUFF AND GWEN IFILL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, JUDY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN! GEP, ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU GUYS BACK. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU GUYS ARE. YOU'RE THE FIRST FEMALE TEAM ANCHORING THE NEWS. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH JIM LEHRER'S BODY? (LAUGHTER) WHY -- WHAT DID HE DO TO DESERVE TO BE SHUNTED ASIDE BY YOU TWO PUSHY BROADS.
WE CAN TELL YOU, STEPHEN, THEN WE'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.
Stephen: THE PBS NEWSHOUR IS AN HOUR. DO WE NEED AN HOUR OF NEWS EVERY NIGHT? (LAUGHTER) THE GUYS OVER ON THE NETWORKS ARE DOING IT-- AND THE GIRLS, AND DIANE SAWYER-- THEY'RE DOING IN THE A HALF HOUR EVERY NIGHT PLUS COMMERCIALS AND, BOOM, WE'RE WATCHING "JEOPARDY." (LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU GET SO MUCH MORE ON THE PBS NEWSHOUR.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU GET?
WELL, YOU GET COVERAGE OF THE DAY'S MOST IMPORTANT STORIES, WHETHER IT'S HEALTH CARE REFORM, THE HEALTH CARE LAW THAT YOU JUST SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT, THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE, THE -- WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE DRONE STRIKES.
Stephen: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN-DEPTH.
IN-DEPTH.
Stephen: TIME FOR IN-DEPTH. WHAT IS THE VALUE OF IN-DEPTH AND, GWEN, YOU ANSWER IN FIVE WORDS OF LESS, PLEASE.
THERE IS NOT MUCH VALUE IN -- THAT'S FIVE!
Stephen: SORRY, THERE IS NOT MUCH VALUE IN IN-DEPTH. SORRY, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR, GWEN.
SEE, THAT'S THE THING. WE NEVER RUN OUT OF TIME.
Stephen: BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH YOU TWO IS THAT YOU'RE VERY LEVEL HEADED. I GET INFORMATION FROM YOU. WHEN I WATCH THE NEWS I'M LOOKING FOR EMOTION. WHICH OF YOU IS GOING TO BE THE CONSERVATIVE, WHICH ONE IS GOING TO BE THE LIBERAL AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE FIGHTING OVER?
IF YOU WANT FIGHTING AND YOU WANT OPINION THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES TO GO. OUR VIEW, STEPHEN, IS THAT OUR VIEWERS ARE SMART AND CURIOUS SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION AND LET THEM MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS.
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS SAY TO ME "I ONLY WATCH COLBERT" OR "I ONLY WATCH JON STEWART" AND THEN I TELL THEM YOU GUYS WATCH US TO FIND OUT WHAT'S REAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I DO, I DO WATCH YOU GUYS BECAUSE I'M HOPING YOU'LL TAKE MY SUGGESTION OF HAVING MARK SHIELDS AND DAVID BROOKS FIGHT IN A PIT. (LAUGHTER) THAT WOULD BE EXCITING.
I CAN TELL THEM.
Stephen: MODERN BEAR-BAITING. YOU GUYS HAVE BOTH BEEN IN THE NEWS FOR A LONG TIME. HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S CHANGED? YOU SEEM TO HAVE AN OLDER MODEL OF NEWS THAT IS NEWS AS INFORMATION NOT NEWS AS ENTERTAINMENT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S OLD. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT VIEWERS ARE SMART, THEY CAN MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS. I THINK THAT'S A NEW IDEA. I THINK FRANKLY BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT -- MUCH OF WHAT YOU SEE ON TELEVISION TODAY IS ABOUT OPINION.
Stephen: OPINION IS ALSO A GREAT PENNY-PINCHER BECAUSE YOU DON'T TO BACK OPINION UP WITH ANYTHING. (LAUGHTER) WE DO THIS SHOW FOR $1.29 AN EPISODE. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS CHEAPER PER POUND THAN GREEN BEANS. I CAN JUST MAKE UP ALL THE FACTS I WANT. YOU GUYS, DO YOU FACT CHECK THE THINGS YOU'LL BE TELLING US?
WELL, WHEN WE ASK FOR MONEY THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE NEWS. IT'S A NOVEL IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO GO GET THE NEWS AND BRING IT BACK AND THEN LET PEOPLE DECIDE.
Stephen: THAT BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER PROBLEM. YOU GUYS ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG DO NATEORS. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU GUYS GET YOUR MONEY FROM VIEWERS --
VIEWERS LIKE YOU.
Stephen: VIEWERS LIKE YOU. EXACTLY. BUT WHAT IF VIEWERS LIKE THEM HAVE A SCANDAL. WILL YOU BE REPORTING ON VIEWERS LIKE THEM KNOWING THAT THEY COULD PULL THE FUNDING ON YOUR SNOW.
IF IT'S A SCANDAL THAT WE THINK AFFECTS -- MOST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT, SURE
WHEN B.P. WAS DUMPING OIL INTO THE GULF, THEY WERE ONE OF OUR UNDERWRITERS AND EVERY NIGHT WE WOULD SAY "B.P. IS MANY OF OUR UNDERWRITERS, NOW LET ME TELL YOU HOW MANY BARRELS OF OIL WENT INTO THE GULF TODAY." IT DIDN'T STOP US FROM COVERING THE STORY BUT IT ALLOWED US TO COVER THE STORY.
Stephen: DO THEY STILL UNDERWRITE YOUR SNOW
NO, ACTUALLY. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: INTERESTING. INTERESTING. INTERESTING. ALL RIGHT, NOW I'M THRILLED THAT WE HAVE TWO FEMALE ANCHORS FINALLY GIVING US THE NEWS BUT, OF COURSE, LIKE THE HIGHLANDER, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. HOW WILL YOU ACTUALLY BACK STAB EACH OTHER AND BECOME THE ONLY ANCHOR.
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO BUT IT'S AN UGLY BUSINESS. ARE YOU GUYS FRIENDS?
YES.
WE ARE FRIENDS, WE LIKE EACH OTHER. WE RESPECT EACH OTHER. AND LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, STEPHEN THINK HOW FAR THE COUNTRY HAS COME JUST USING HALF OF ITS TALENT. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH FARTHER WE CAN GO IF WE USE ALL OF THE TALENT. IF WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO DO WHAT MEN HAVE DONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, BUT AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET MY MAN NEWS WHEN I CHECK IN WITH THE LADIES? BECAUSE LAST NIGHT I REPORTED ON WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT BETWEEN A LION AND A TIGER. I DON'T THINK A WOMAN WOULD REPORT ON THAT. I BROKE THAT STORY, JUDY.
YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
Stephen: I FWLEK STORY.
HERE'S THE THING. WHEN WE GOT THIS JOB WE THOUGHT IT WAS A NATURAL PROGRESSION FOR US. AND WE WERE SURPRISED AND TAKEN ABACK BY HOW MANY WOMEN-- ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN-- REACTED EMOTIONALLY ABOUT THE IDEA THAT WE ARE SITTING IN THESE CHAIRS SO I DON'T KNOW YOU, JUDY, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE TAKEN IT MORE SERIOUSLY SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE CHAIR BECAUSE I DID BEFORE.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY. THE PBS NEWSHOUR HAS BEEN SO SILLY FOR SO MANY YEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. GWEN IFILL, JUDY WOODRUFF. ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE YOU ON! JUDY WOODRUFF, GWEN IFILL.
