Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, WE ARE 12  MINUTES CLOSER TO ELECTION  DAY. AND AS OF 11:43100 ZULU TIME  THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO  DESCRIBE THIS RACE.
THE RACE IS AS TIGHT AS  THEY COME.
THIS RACE IS ABSOLUTELY  RAZOR TIGHT.
THE LOOK AT OTHER  NATIONAL POLLS CONFIRM IT'S  RAZOR TIGHT.
WE'VE SEEN THE POLLS  RAZOR TIGHT.
THIS RACE REMAINS RAZOR  TIGHT.
Stephen: YES, THIS RACE  IS RAZOR TIGHT. THAT MEANS NO MARGIN FOR  ERROR OR CORRECT USE OF  METAPHOR. I MEAN IT'S BANANA UP FOR  GRABS. BUT-- FOLKS EVERY PREDICTION  OUT THERE, EVERY PREDICTION  NEEDS A POOPER. IN THIS CASE, "NEW YORK  TIMES" POLLING JEDI NATE  SILVER WHO IN 2008 CORRECTLY  PREDICTED 49 OUT OF 50  STATES. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,  EVEN A STOPPED CLOCK IS  RIGHT 98% OF THE TIME. THE SILVER'S GOT A COMPUTER  MODEL THAT USES PETROLEUM BO  JUMBO LIKE WEIGHTED POLLING AVERAGE, TREND LINE  ADJUSTMENT AND LINEAR  REGRESSION ANALYSISMENT BUT  IGNORES PROVEN METHODOLOGIES LIKE FLAG PIN SIZE,  HANDSHAKE STRENGTH AND  INTENSITY OF DEBATE GLARE. AND AS OF TONIGHT, FOLKS,  SILVER IS PREDICTING THAT  OBAMA HAS AN 86.3% CHANCE OF WINNING RE-ELECTION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH. I DON'T BUY IT EITHER. WHERE DOES HE GET OFF  PREDICTING SOMETHING OTHER  THAN THE AGREED NARRATIVE? I MEAN WHAT PART OF RAZOR  TIGHT DOES HE NOT  UNDERSTAND? (LAUGHTER)  THAT JUST MAKES ME SO CRAB  CLAW ANGRY. (LAUGHTER)  NOW FOLKS, I AM NOT THE ONLY  ONE TARNISHING SILVER'S  STERLING REPUTATION. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  NO, SO IS JO SQLO STARBUCKS  WITH MIKA AND THE MORNING  WILLIE.
NATE SILVER SAYS THIS IS  A 73.6% CHANCE THAT THE  PRESIDENT IS GOING TO WIN. ANYBODY THAT THINKS THAT  THIS RACE IS ANYTHING BUT A  TOSS UP RIGHT NOW IS SUCH AN IDEALOGUE THEY SHOULD BE  KEPT AWAY FROM TYPEWRITERS  BECAUSE THEY'RE JOKES.
Stephen: YEAH, SILVER AND  HIS MATH ARE JOKES. BECAUSE MATH HAS A LIBERAL  BIAS. AFTER ALL, MATH IS THE  REASON MITT ROMNEY'S TAX  PLAN DOESN'T ADD UP. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS, THERE'S  ONLY ONE WAY, I'M TELLING  YOU, THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO CALL THIS RACE. AS SCARBOROUGH HIMSELF WROTE,  MY GUT TELLS ME THERE ARE  TWO LIKELY SCENARIOS. ONE, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL  SQUEAK OUT A NARROW  ELECTORAL COLLEGE VICTORY OR  TWO, MITT ROMNEY WILL CARRY OHIO AND BE SWEPT INTO  OFFICE BY A COMFORTABLE  MARGIN. AFTER 20 YEARS IN POLITICS,  FIVE ELECTION CYCLES  GRINDING IT OUT ON MSNBC,  JOE'S GUT IS TELLING HIM EITHER OBAMA WILL WIN OR  ROMNEY WILL WIN. I MEAN WHERE DOES HE FIND  THE COURAGE? (APPLAUSE)  WHEN WE RETURN I WILL BRING  THAT KIND OF TAKE NO PRISONER'S  BALL SWINGING TO MY GUEST "THE NEW YORK TIMES" 538  BLOGGER NATE SILVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
