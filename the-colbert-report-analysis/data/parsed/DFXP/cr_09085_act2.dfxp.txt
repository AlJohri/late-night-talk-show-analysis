[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLKS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF ANYONE OUT  THERE WATCHING IS THINKING OF  VISITING NEW YORK CITY THERE'S SO MANY GREAT THINGS TO SEE, BUT  NOTHING IS MORE ICONIC THAN THE  COSTUME MASCOTS IN TIMES SQUARE.
