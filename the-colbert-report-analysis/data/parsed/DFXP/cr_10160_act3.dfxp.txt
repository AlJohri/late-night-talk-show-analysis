Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PSYCHOLOGIST WHOSE NEW BOOK SAYS DELAYED GRATIFICATION LEADS TO MORE SUCCESS IN LIFE. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO PLACES, YOU'LL WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK. PLEASE WELCOME WALTER MISCHEL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IS IT DR. MISCHEL?
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
OH, NO, WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
MY NAME IS WALTER.
Stephen:  IT'S JUST WALTER. WALTER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU HOLD THE ROBERT JOHNSON NIVEN CHAIR AS PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. YOU'RE AN EGG HEAD IN MORE THAN ONE WAY. YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED TO THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES WON THE CONTRIBUTION AWARD BY THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. AND YOUR BOOK IS, "THE MARSHMALLOW TEST-- MASTERING SELF-CONTROL." THIS TITLE HAS SO MANY THINGS I LIKE "MYSELF, CONTROL, AND MARSHMALLOWS." EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE OUT THERE MARSHMALLOW TEST. WHEN DID YOU HOLD THESE TESTS?
MOST OF THE WORK WAS BEGUN IN THE MIDDLE 60s, 1960s. AND THEN IT CONTINUED AND CONTINUED AND CONTINUED, AND IT'S STILL ONGOING NOW.
Stephen:  SO WHAT'S THE TEST?
THE TEST ACTUALLY-- YOU'VE GOT SOME-- YOU WANT-- AND I --
Stephen:  I'LL GO WITH MINE. I'LL GO WITH MINE. THESE ARE PINK.
THEY'RE PINK FROM PARIS.
Stephen:  OR PARIS. LET'S DO THE PARIS PINK ONES. WE HAVE THREE MASH MALOZE HERE. HOW DOES THE TEST WORK.
IT WORKS LIKE THIS. IF I'M THE CHILD --
Stephen:  I'LL THE THE CHILD.
YOU'RE THE CHILD. TWO HERE, ONE HERE. NOW, THERE'S ALSO A BELL OVER HERE THAT YOU CAN RING.
Stephen:  I RING IT OR YOU RING IT?
YOU RING IT.
Stephen:  DING.
I COME RIGHT BACK INTO THE ROOM. RING IT AGAIN.
Stephen:  DING.
I COME BACK INTO THE ROOM. NOW YOU CAN BELIEVE I'LL REALLY COME BACK INTO THE ROOM.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND.
YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE AND TIME YOU WANT. OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE DONE.
Stephen:  DIWIN? DID I WIN.
YOU GOT YOUR ONE. BUT THAT'S IT. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THOSE TWO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS )
Stephen:  ANOTHER SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS, MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU THINK THAT ONE WHO DOESN'T EAT THE MARSHMALLOW FIRST, YOU FOUND WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE?
THE LONGER KIDS WAITED TO GET THE TWO, THE LONGER THEY WAITED, ON THE WHOLE, GENERALLY, THE MORE SUCCESSFUL THEIR LIVES TURNED OUT TO BE IF THEY WERE CONSISTENT IN HOW THEY CONTINUED IN SELF-CONTROL OVER THE LIFE COURSE.
Stephen:  SO DELAYED GRATIFICATION, SAYING WAIT AND YOU'LL GET TWO, IN WHAT OTHER PLACE, OTHER THAN EATING  MARSHMALLOWS, DOES THAT COME IN HANDY.
IT COMES IN HANDY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE TO START DELAYING GRATIFICATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EAT THE MARSHMALLOWS, BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A CLASSROOM, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THE TEACHER IS SAYING. SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT OVER THE YEARS, TO OUR SURPRISE-- I MEAN, WE WEREN'T PREDICTING IT-- THAT LENGTH OF TIME KIDS WAIT IS RELATED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO WHAT THEIR BODY WEIGHT IS, WHAT THEIR BODY WEIGHT INDEX IS, THEIR BODY MASS INDEX IS BY THE TIME THEY'RE 32. IT'S RELATED HOW WELL THEY PURSUE THEIR GOALS, HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE AT WORK. IT'S RELATED TO ALL KIND OF THINGS, INCLUDING S.A.T. SCORES, WHEN THEY'RE ADOLESCENT.
Stephen:  DO WE EVEN NEED THE S.A.T.s ANYMORE IF WE HAVE THE MARSHMALLOW TESTS. WE GET ALL THE KIDS IN THE ROOM, THE KID WHO WAITS FOR THE TWO MARSHMALLOWS, RIGHT TO THE IVY LEAGUE.
THERE ARE A FEW STEPS IN BETWEEN. BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO-- ( LAUGHTER ) IS-- IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE VERY, VERY USEFUL FOR YOU BECAUSE WHAT IT'S SAYING TO US IS THAT YOU ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO KEEP A GOAL IN MIND-- I WANT THE TWO-- YOU WERE ABLE TO INHIBIT INTERFERING RESPONSES LIKE SHOVING IT RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  SO GOOD, THOUGH, THEY'RE DELICIOUS.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL.
Stephen:  YEAH, YEAH.
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO USE YOUR ATTENTION, WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO-- ( LAUGHTER ) IN A WAY THAT LETS YOU ACTUALLY NOT GOBBLE THE MARSHMALLOW AND KEEP ON GOING. THAT'S A VERY FUNDAMENTAL SKILL. IT NOW HAS A FANCY NAME. IT'S CALLED EXECUTIVE CONTROL.
Stephen:  THESE ARE VERY GOOD MARSHMALLOWS.
THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL.
Stephen:  WERE THEY THIS GOOD BACK IN THE 60s, BECAUSE I KNOW MARSHMALLOW TECHNOLOGIES-- EVERY 18 MONTHS THE STORAGE CAPACITY OF A MARSHMALLOW DOUBLES. I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED S'MORES LAW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). DO YOU NOT WANT ONE?
NO, I DON'T YOU.
Stephen:  DON'T WANT ONE?
I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE THE THINGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WALTER, WALTER MISCHEL, THE MARSHMALLOW TEST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
