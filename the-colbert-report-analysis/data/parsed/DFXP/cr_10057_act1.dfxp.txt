[THEME MUSIC PLAYS] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Stephen: HEY, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO "THE REPORT"! GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOO! WHOO! WELCOME! THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LIKE THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, AS I'M SURE YOU CAN HEAR AT HOME EVERYONE IS STILL BUZZING ABOUT THE BIG GAME LAST NIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, PEOPLE WERE TACKLED. (LAUGHTER) BALLS WERE KICKED. DOWNS WERE FOURTHED. (LAUGHTER) AND IN THE END, THE SEATTLE SEAHAWKS SEA-STOMPED THE DENVER BRONCOS 43 TO 8. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A ROUTE FROM THE BEGINNING STARTING WITH PEYTON MANNING'S OPENING SNAP. (LAUGHTER) NOW, DUE TO FEAR OF BEING SUED BY THE N.F.L., I CANNOT SHOW YOU THE FOOTAGE BUT IT FELT SOMETHING LIKE THIS:  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW, ADMITTEDLY, THAT FOOTAGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FOOTBALL, BUT IT FELT A LOT LIKE THAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOLKS, THE REAL REASON I WATCH THE GAME IS TO SEE THE ADS. LAST NIGHT YOU HAD ALL THE BIG NAMES, BUDWEISER, FORD, RADIO SHACK. [LAUGHTER] BUT, REALLY ONLY ONE COMMERCIAL MATTERED, A TRULY NUTTY AD THAT (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT DROVE THE COUNTRY NUTS. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT COCA-COLA. [LAUGHTER] THEIR COMMERCIAL CERTAINLY GOT MY FELLOW CONSERVATIVES'  BLOOD BUBBLING.
HOW ABOUT THAT COCA-COLA COMMERCIAL? DID YOU HEAR THAT COCA-COLA COMMERCIAL?
THE COKE COMMERCIAL SPARKED CONTROVERSY.
THE COKE COMMERCIAL WAS A SLAP IN THE FACE TO AMERICA.
YOU TICKED OFF A LOT OF COKE DRINKERS, YOU TICKED OFF A LOT OF AMERICANS.
COKE, YOU BLEW IT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE.
YEAH, THEY BLEW IT WITH ME AND I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE AD. [LAUGHTER] BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY RAN IT WHEN THE GAME WAS ALREADY OVER -- THE SECOND QUARTER. [LAUGHTER] SO, JIM. I TELL YOU WHAT, IN FAIRNESS, GIVE ME A TASTE. ♪ OH BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS ♪ SKIES (SONG CONTINUES IN SPANISH) ♪  (SONG CONTINUES IN VARIETY OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES)
Stephen: (SCREAMING) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: (SCREAMING) (LAUGHTER) THEY WERE SINGING "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL" IN FOREIGN TALK! [LAUGHTER] COME ON, ONLY ENGLISH CAN GIVE THAT SONG ITS CERTAIN JE NE SAIS QUOI. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, FOLKS, THE LAST THING I  WANT TO BE IS A  PRIMA DONNA HERE BUT I AM FULL OF SCHADENFREUDE OVER THIS. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S OUTRAGED. EXCONGRESSMAN AND FORMER EMPLOYABLE PERSON ALLEN WEST ANGER BLOGGED "IT STARTED RATHER PATRIOTICALLY WITH THE WORDS OF AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL THEN THE WORDS WENT FROM ENGLISH TO LANGUAGES I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE." (LAUGHTER) YES, THIS MAN ONCE REPRESENTED FLORIDA AND THEN SERVED IN IRAQ. HOW WAS HE SUPPOSED TO RECOGNIZE SPANISH AND ARABIC? (LAUGHTER) AND THE WEBSITE THEBRIGHTPART.CA'S MICHAEL LEAHY TRULY CAPTURED WHY WE'RE SO ANGRY SAYING THAT, "THE COMPANY USED SUCH AN ICONIC SONG, ONE OFTEN SUNG IN CHURCHES ON THE 4TH OF JULY THAT REPRESENTS THE OLD E PLURIBUS UNUM VIEW OF HOW AMERICAN SOCIETY IS INTEGRATED TO PUSH MULTICULTURALISM DOWN OUR THROATS. YES, THE OLD E PLURIBUS UNUM. THAT'S LATIN FOR "SPEAK-A-DA ENGLISH." (LAUGHTER) AND AS LEAHY POINTS OUT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT THEY SANG, [quote] (AUDIENCE REACTS) FOR PETE'S SAKE, SINCE WHEN ARE GAYS ALLOWED TO GAY UP "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL?" (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, IF THE WOMAN WHO WROTE THE SONG, KATHERINE LEE BATES SAW THIS AD, SHE WOULD BE DISGUSTED AND SO WOULD HER LIFE PARTNER KATHERINE COLEMAN WITH WHOM SHE LIVED FOR 25 YEARS IN WHAT WAS THEN REFERRED TO AS A "BOSTON MARRIAGE." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, THAT WAS NOT A GAY MARRIAGE, IT WAS THE 19th CENTURY. WOMEN COULD NOT BE LESBIANS BACK THEN, OKAY? THEY COULDN'T EVEN VOTE. OR, AS LESBIANS CALL IT, SCISSORING. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THAT'S IT, AMERICA. I AM OFFICIALLY REMOVING COCA-COLA FROM THE ALL-AMERICAN MEAL, WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW IS HOT DOG FOR ENTREE, A SIDE OF BASEBALL GLOVE, APPLE PIE FOR DESSERT AND, OF COURSE, MOM WHICH STANDS FOR MONO OXIDASE METHYL HYDRATE, A SHELF-SAFE COAGULANT THAT GIVES THE APPLE PIE ITS SUSTAINED FEELING OF WETNESS. COKE, OF COURSE,  WAS THE VEGETABLE. NATION, I KNOW -- COKE'S A FRUIT, NO LETTERS. NATION, I'M IN NO POSITION TO JUDGE OTHERS. THERE, THAT'S BETTER. THIS IS TIP OF THE HAT, WAG OF THE FINGER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [GONG] THE SUPER BOWL IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS OF THE YEAR  BECAUSE  FOOTBALL IS AMERICA'S GAME. WE ALL LOVE IT! BUT UNFORTUNATELY, FOLKS, SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE AREN'T CHEERING FOR OUR N.F.L. HEROES. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT THE CHEERLEADERS.
THE OAKLAND RAIDERS ARE BEING SUED BY THE TEAM'S CHEERLEADERS, CURRENT AND FORMER RAIDERETTES. THEY ACCUSE THE TEAM OF WAGE THEFT AND UNFAIR  EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.
THE SUIT CLAIMS WHEN THE SEASON WAS ALL SAID AND DONE THE CHEERLEADERS ENDED UP MAKING LESS THAN $5 AN HOUR.
WHAT ARE THEY COMPLAINING ABOUT? AT LEAST WE PAY THEM! I MEAN, THE REFS HAVE TO TAKE A SECOND JOB AT THE FOOT LOCKER. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO LITIGIOUS CHEERLEADERS. THE N.F.L. CAN'T GIVE CHEERLEADERS RAISES. IF THEY HAVE MORE MONEY THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO AFFORD MORE CLOTHING! [LAUGHTER] HOW CAN WE KNOW THEY'RE EXCITED IF WE CAN'T COUNT THEIR RIBS? (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, IF COLLECTIVE ACTION  WORKS IN THIS CASE  IT COULD LEAD TO A CHEERLEADER UNION. SOON YOU'LL BE IN THE STANDS GETTING REVVED UP BY THIS GUY. DON'T TOUCH HIS POM-POMS, ONLY HE CAN MOVE THE POM-POMS. (LAUGHTER) FRANKLY, FRANKLY, I GOTTA SAY FOLKS THIS MAKES ME QUESTION EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I KNEW ABOUT CHEERLEADERS. MAYBE THEY REALLY DID WANT TO TALK TO ME IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT I WAS TOO HOT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I'VE SAID IT MANY TIMES, I'M NO FAN OF POPE FRANCIS. I KNOW HE'S GOD'S VOICE ON EARTH BUT SOMETIMES HE COMES OFF AS PREACHY. [LAUGHTER] WELL LOOKY LOOK WHO'S ON THE COVER OF THE CURRENT ISSUE OF "ROLLING STONE." THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S DAFT PONTIFF. AND I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS UPSET AT "ROLLING STONE" SINCE THEIR 1993 COVER FEATURING MOTHER TERESA. (AUDIENCE REACTS) SO, YO, I'M MAD, TOO. OH, I'M MAD, TOO. I THOUGHT THAT WAS WRONG. SO I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO THE POPE FOR GOING MAINSTREAM WHAT'S NEXT? YOU'RE HEARING HIS ENCYCLICALS PLAYING IN STARBUCKS? [LAUGHTER] WE REAL POPE-HEADS ARE ONLY INTO THE PAPACY'S EARLY STUFF, LIKE FELIX THE THIRD. I MEAN 483 TO 492? THAT IS OLD SCHOOL! HIS REPUDIATION OF THE HEROTICON OF EMPEROR ZENO AT THE RECONCILE OF CATHOLICS AND MONOPHYSITES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ACACIAN SCHISM, THAT IS MY JAM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I SAY YOU FORGET THIS SELLOUT POPE. THESE DAYS I'M MORE INTO COPTIC POPE, TAWADROS II OF ALEXANDRIA. I MEAN YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD OF HIM, HE'S BIG IN EGYPT BUT HE HASN'T BROKEN IN THE STATES YET. [LAUGHTER] NEXT UP, FOLKS, LONG-TIME VIEWERS OF THE "REPORT" KNOW I'M NO FAN OF CHINA. FOR ONE THING, WHY DON'T ANY OF THEIR ATHLETES HAVE SKIN? (AUDIENCE REACTS) BUT EVEN I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN CHINA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BANNED CIGARETTES FROM KINDERGARTENS AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. (BOOS) YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. FROM NOW ON IF CHINESE STUDENTS WANT TO SMOKE THEY'LL HAVE TO GET THEIR SMOOTH FLAVOR FROM THE SKY. (LAUGHTER) SO FOLKS I -- TONIGHT I'M GIVING A WAG OF MY FINGER TO CHINA. [GONG] AMERICA IS THE LAND OF THE FREE, BUT CHINA IS THE LAND OF FREEDOM FROM REGULATION. IT'S THE ONLY COUNTRY ON EARTH WHERE DRY WALL IS A FLAVOR OF TOOTHPASTE. (LAUGHTER) I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY KICKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN OUT OF MARLBORO COUNTRY. JUMPING OFF THE TOBACCO DRAGON WILL NOT BE EASY. THEY GET HOOKED EARLY CHINA. I MEAN, THIS IS THEIR PACIFIER. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF CHINA. CHINA. FOLKS, BACK IN DECEMBER I SHARED MY OUTRAGE THAT THE MOON-- AMERICA'S MOON-- HAD ALLOWED A CHINESE ROVER, THE JADE RABBIT, TO LAND ON ITS SURFACE EVEN THOUGH THE MOON'S CLEARLY NOT OVER US YET. WHY ELSE WOULD IT KEEP LOOKING THROUGH OUR WINDOWS AT NIGHT? (LAUGHTER) BUT HUNAN, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
CHINA'S MOON ROVER HAS APPARENTLY BROKEN DOWN ON THE LUNAR SURFACE. OFFICIALS  SAY SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE JADE RABBIT'S  MECHANICAL CONTROLS. THEY BELIEVE IT WAS CAUSED BY THE "COMPLICATED LUNAR SURFACE ENVIRONMENT."
THE ROVER HAS TO GO INTO HIBERNATION MODE WHEN IT GETS EXCEPTIONALLY COLD AND A GLITCH ISN'T LETTING DO IT THAT.
Stephen: SO TONIGHT A RARE DOUBLE WAG OF MY FINGER TO  CHINA. [TWO GONGS] [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, NOT JUST FOR INVADING OUR MOON WITH THEIR ROVER, BUT FOR TRYING TO MAKE ME CARE ABOUT IT! (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- CHINA'S ACTUAL OFFICIAL STATEMENT ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WAS WRITTEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE DOOMED ROVER. JIM?
"MY MASTERS DISCOVERED SOMETHING ABNORMAL WITH MY MECHANICAL CONTROL SYSTEM. MY MASTERS ARE STAYING UP ALL NIGHT WORKING FOR A SOLUTION. NEVERTHELESS, I'M AWARE I MIGHT NOT SURVIVE THIS LUNAR NIGHT."
Stephen: NO, NO, FOLKS, THAT STUFF HAPPENS. GO ON.
"BEFORE DEPARTURE I STUDIED THE HISTORY OF MANKIND'S LUNAR PROBES. ABOUT HALF OF THE PAST 130 EXPLORATIONS ENDED IN SUCCESS. THE REST ENDED IN FAILURE. THIS IS SPACE EXPLORATION. THE DANGER COMES WITH ITS BEAUTY. I AM BUT A TINY DOT IN THE VAST PICTURE OF THIS ADVENTURE." (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: DAMN THESE WINTER ALLERGIES! THAT SNOWSTORM IS KICKING UP A LOT OF POLLEN.
"THE SUN HAS FALLEN AND THE TEMPERATURE IS DROPPING SO  QUICKLY. TO TELL YOU ALL A SECRET, I DON'T FEEL THAT SAD. I WAS JUST IN MY OWN ADVENTURE STORY AND LIKE EVERY HERO I ENCOUNTERED A SMALL PROBLEM. GOOD NIGHT, EARTH. GOOD NIGHT, HUMANITY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: DAMN IT! (SOBBING) YOU MADE ME MOURN A PIECE OF CHINESE TECHNOLOGY! AND I DIDN'T EVEN DROP THIS ONE IN THE TOILET! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
