[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION... [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] I CAN'T FIGHT THE LOVE-NAMI. NATION, IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE, IT'S WHETHER I WIN OR LOSE. THIS IS THE SPORT REPORT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, TODAY MARKS THE START OF THE 2014 SOCCER WORLD CUP IN BRAZIL. AND I AM FEELING THE SOCCER EQUIVALENT OF EXCITEMENT. MEANING I CAN'T USE MY HANDS. NOW, UNFORTUNATELY THIS YEAR'S 1-1 TIES ARE GOING TO BE MUCH LESS THRILLING BECAUSE FIREWORKS AND VUVUZELAS HAVE BEEN FORBIDDEN FROM WORLD CUP STADIUMS. [AUDIENCE REACTS] WHAT THE CUP? THEY'RE TAKING AWAY MY FIREWORKS AND THE THING I SHOOT MY FIREWORKS OUT OF? NOW HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PASS THE TIME IN BETWEEN THE PRE-GAME RIOT AND THE POST-GAME RIOT? THAT ISN'T THE BIGGEST PROBLEM HERE. TEAM U.S.A. IS FACING AN UP-PITCH BATTLE.
TEAM U.S.A. CONTINUES THEIR BUILDUP TO THE WORLD CUP.
THEY'RE UP AGAINST A LOT. AMERICA WILL COMPETE IN GROUP "G" WITH GERMANY, PORTUGAL AND GHANA.
THEY'LL FACE SOME OF THEIR TOUGHEST OPPONENTS IN THE FIRST ROUND, SO BAD IT'S BEING CALLED "THE GROUP OF DEATH."
Stephen: YES, THE GROUP OF DEATH. AN AFFILIATION GERMANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM FOR ABOUT 70 YEARS. NOW, FAITH... FACED WITH THIS CHALLENGE, TEAM U.S.A.'S COACH STEPPED UP AND SURRENDERED, SAYING, "WE CANNOT WIN THIS WORLD CUP BECAUSE WE ARE NOT AT THAT LEVEL YET. REALISTICALLY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE." [AUDIENCE REACTS] YOU DON'T THINK AN AMERICAN TEAM COULD WIN? WHAT KIND OF AN AMERICAN WOULD SAY THAT? TERMS OUT A GERMAN ONE. BECAUSE TEAM U.S.A.'S COACH IS JUERGEN KLINSMANN, A GERMAN SOCCER STAR SEEN HERE BEING GERMAN. [LAUGHTER] HE ALSO SAID, "WE HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME OF OUR LIVES SEVEN TIMES TO WIN THE TOURNAMENT." SO WHAT? SO WHAT, JURGEN, WE CAN PLAY THE GAME OF OUR LIVES SEVEN TIMES. HELL, THEY DID IT EVERY NIGHT ON "FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS." WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, FIELD MARSHALL BUZZKILL? THAT'S NOT THE AMERICAN WAY TO GIVE UP BEFORE YOU BEGIN. WHAT IF THE PILGRIMS HAD GONE BACK TO ENGLAND AND SAID, "THERE'S NO POINT. WE'LL NEVER KILL THAT MANY INDIANS." I JUST DON'T GET THESE GERMAN SOCCER PLAYERS. HERE TO HELP ME GET THESE GERMAN SOCCER PLAYERS IS GERMANY'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS. PLEASE WELCOME THE HONORABLE HANS BEINHOLZ. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW, YOUR EXCELLENCY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME HERE TO DISCUSS THE GAME.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN. LIKE MANY, I HAVE WORLD CUP FEVER. SMITTEN WITHIN THE TERRIBLE DISEASE  OF NATIONALISM AND COMPETITION, THE TWIN SEEDS OF WAR.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU WANT YOUR OWN TEAM TO WIN. I ASSUME YOU'RE GOING TO BE ROOTING FOR GERMANY.
YES, BUT WHAT IN TRUTH DO WE WIN? THE WORLD CUP IS AN OPIATE OF THE MASSES, A QUADRENNIAL CELEBRATION OF BRUTE PHYSICALITY BY WHICH WE HOPE TO QUELL THE NAUSEA OF THE HORROR OF HUMAN EXISTENCE GO, TEAM. [APPLAUSE]
Stephen: OKAY. FINE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE U.S.'S COACH? WHY WON'T HE MOTIVATE OUR TEAM?
DO YOU MEAN LIE TO THEM? TELL THEM THAT THEY ARE BETTER THAN HE KNOWS THEM TO BE? NEIN. TO LOVE SOMEONE  IS TO CONFRONT THEM WITH THEIR OWN WORTHLESSNESS. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: THAT HELPS?
IT HELPS THE LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM THAT I COACH. [LAUGHTER] BEFORE EVERY GAME I TELL THE CHILDREN, WE CANNOT WIN. OUR SCORE WILL BE MEAGER. WE WILL SUFFER AT THE CRUEL HANDS OF THE BLUE GOPHERS, AND EVEN IF WE WIN, VICTORY IS ONLY A FLEETING JOY THAT SOON DISINTEGRATES INTO SORROW, EVEN AS IN THE BEAUTY OF THE DAWN WE GRIEVE FOR THE COMING DUSK AND IN THE BIRTH OF A CHILD WE  SMELL THE ACRID STENCH OF THE GRAVE.
Stephen: THE HONORABLE HANS BEINHOLZ, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
