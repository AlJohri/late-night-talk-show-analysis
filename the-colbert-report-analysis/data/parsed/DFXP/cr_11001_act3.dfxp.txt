STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A WORLD-RENOWNED CHEF AND TV HOST. I'LL ASK WHERE YOU GET THAT OVEN THAT ALWAYS HAS THE MEAL READY IN IT. PLEASE WELCOME JAMIE OLIVER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: HEY, JAMIE! THANKS FOR COMING ON! NICE TO MEET YOU! ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT A LITTLE FOOD TO EAT LATER WHICH I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT.
YEAH, WE DO.
STEPHEN: BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT, LET'S GET TO  THE HEAT OF THE MEAT IF YOU WILL. YOU ARE A WORLD-RENOWNED CHEF AND YOUR BOOK IS CALLED "COMFORT FOOD:  THE ULTIMATE WEEKEND COOKBOOK."
YES, SIR.
STEPHEN: BEFORE WE GET TO "COMFORT FOOD," AREN'T YOU MR. EAT HEALTHY, LET ME GO TO YOUR SCHOOL AND RUIN MCNUGGETS  FOR YOU? IF YOU'RE A HEALTHY GUY, HOW CAN YOU WRITE  "COMFORT FOOD," BECAUSE THIS HAS GOT SOME CALORIES IN IT
I'VE ALWAYS CELEBRATED THE JOY OF COOKING REAL FOOD. DEFINITELY IN THIS DAY AND AGE, YOU HAVE TO WATCH WHAT YOU EAT FOR SURE. THERE'S ENOUGH STUFF IN HERE THAT'S NICE AND HEALTHY BUT THE INDULGENT STUFF, YOU CAN'T MAKE A HEALTHY PIE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T MAKE A HEALTHY DESSERT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YOU'VE GOT TO EAT THAT STUFF! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN: SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, DON'T HALF-ASS IT, GO ALL THE WAY?
YES, FOR SURE! I MEAN, NOT EVERY DAY. BUT DEFINITELY, THIS IS THE STUFF MEMORIES ARE MADE OF!
STEPHEN: ARE THESE YOUR CHILDHOOD RECIPES? THESE ARE INCREDIBLY COMFORTING DISHES. THEY'RE ALMOST COMA FOOD. WERE THESE DISHES YOUR CHILDHOOD DISHES?
SOME OF THEM WERE. SOME ARE THE FOOD FROM MY CHILDHOOD, THE STUFF ANY NAN DID, MY GRAND-DAD DID, MY MOM, THE WEEKENDS, THE BARBECUE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT IN THESE DAYS, I THINK IT'S NICE TO REACH OUT TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND WE DID THIS THING ON INSTAGRAM WHERE WE ASKED THE COMMUNITY WHAT WAS YOUR COMFORT FOOD? AND IT WENT CRAZY. WECOUNTED THROUGH THEM ALL, AND I THOUGHT  IT WAS IMPORTANT TO STUDY AND TEST AND COOK COMFORT FOOD  FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
STEPHEN: WHY IS IT COMFORTING OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT PUTS YOU DOWN LIKE AN OLD DOG? BEFORE WE HAD XANAX, WE HAD MASHED POTATOES.
IT RELEASES ENDORPHINS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS. THERE'S' SOMETHING ABOUT A PIE OR MEATBALLS OR SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING A HUG.
STEPHEN: EVENTUALLY YOUR BODY HUGS YOU ALL THE TIME.
YES.
STEPHEN: IT'S LIKE ANOTHER PERSON ON YOU. (LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN'T RUSH THIS FOOD, IT'S STUFF YOU HAVE TO PUT LOVE INTO.
STEPHEN: I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
WHY?
STEPHEN: THIS IS AMERICA, I WANT TO EAT FAST AND GO BACK TO MY INTERNET. (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE A FAVORITE COMFORT FOOD YOU COULD SERVE ME?
I'VE GOT ONE FROM MY CHILDHOOD.
STEPHEN: I HAVE ONE FROM MY CHILDHOOD, TOO. CAN I GIVE IT TO YOU?
STEPHEN: SURE, CAN I GIVE IT TO YOU?
YES PLEASE.
STEPHEN: WHAT DO YOU HAVE? A PUDDING.
STEPHEN: I HAVE A BLUEBERRY COBBLER.
WHOO!
STEPHEN: IF I DO THAT WITH MINE, IT'S GOING TO BE A MESS.
OKAY.
STEPHEN: OKAY, HERE WE GO. NO, THIS IS BASICALLY KIND OF AN EVOLUTION OF MY MOM AND MY NAN'S STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING.
STEPHEN: AND THAT'S SOME HOMER FORMBY'S DECK POLISH?  WHAT IS THAT?
IF YOU BRUSH IT ON, IT KEEPS THE STEAM INSIDE. BUT ALSO IT DOES LACQUER FLOORBOARDS BEAUTIFULLY. NO, BUT IT GOES WAFER THIN CRISP ONCE YOU'VE DONE IT BUT IT GETS BETTER THAN TAT. WHAT YOU CAN DO, ONCE YOU BRUSH THIS BEAUTIFUL THING -- THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL THING. WHAT I DO IS I GET BEAUTIFUL DATES, THAT'S THE SECRET ININGREDIENT, AND I REHYDRATE THEM IN EARL GREY TEA. THAT'S A TWIST OF FLAVOR.
STEPHEN: YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU START COOKING YOU COMPLETELY  CHANGE LIKE A MARVEL SUPERHERO (LAUGHTER) YOU TALK IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY!
ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT, I LIKE TO SIMPLY FILL THE ORIFICE WITH -- (AUDIENCE REACTS)
AND THEN, LIKE THE JAMES BOND CHAMPAGNE MOMENT, IF YOU CAN JUST CUT YOURSELF A WEDGE, A REGULAR PORTION,  AND JUST LET IT ALL OOZE OUT.
STEPHEN: AHHH! OH, JESUS! OH, MY GOD!
AND THAT'S A BIG PORTION, DUDE.
STEPHEN: YOU SAID A REGULAR PORTION. OKAY. I'LL DO YOU HERE. THIS IS BLUEBERRY COBBLER.
IT GETS THE TASTE BUDS GOING. BELIEVE ME. OH, NO, THIS IS GOOD! THIS IS IMPRESSIVE!
STEPHEN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'LL GIVE YOU MY REGULAR PORTION OF BLUEBERRY COBBLER. (LAUGHTER) I'LL TAKE A LITTLE ICE CREAM RIGHT THERE, OKAY, PUT THAT ON THE SIDE, AND JUST A LITTLE -- (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, CHEERS, CHEERS. WHATEVER YOU DO, GET SOME SWEET PART THERE. READY?
YEAH.
STEPHEN: ALL RIGHT. MMM!
MMM!
STEPHEN: I HAVE FOUND THIS INTERVIEW... SO COMFORTING... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JAMIE OLIVER, THANK YOU SO MUCH! JAMIE OLIVER, "COMFORT FOOD"! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
