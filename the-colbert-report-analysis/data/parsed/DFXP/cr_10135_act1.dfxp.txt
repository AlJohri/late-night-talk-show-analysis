(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN")
THANK YOU, FOLKS, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD! FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S GREAT TO KNOW I HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. WHILE I AM PRIMARILY A PUNDIT AND NEWSMAN MY MEDIA EMPIRE EXTENDS ALL THROUGHOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO THIS SHOW I HAVE MY BEST SELLING CHILDREN'S BOOK, MY TEK JANSEN ALPHA SQUAD 7 GRAPHIC NOVELS AND OF COURSE MY FAMILY FRIENDLY KU KLUX CARTOONS. CALL ME, NICK JR., OKAY, OR YOU'RE THE RACIST. BUT EVEN MEDIA MOGULS LIKE ME GOT TO STAY CONNECTED TO THE FANS. AND THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO DO THAT THAN AT THIS WEEKEND'S SAN DIEGO COMIC CON WHERE EVERY CONCEIVABLE SCI-FI, TV SHOW, MOVIE OR BOOK IS SHAKING IT'S LITTLE MONEYMAKER FOR AT LEAST 130,000 RABID ATTENDEES. IT IS AN ORGY OF PEOPLE WHO WILL PROBABLY NOT BE INVITED TO THE ORGY (LAUGHTER) BUT BESIDES, BESIDES BEING THE SUPER BOWL OF MARKETING. IT IS ALSO THE WORLD SERIES OF COSPLAY. YOU CAN BE BATMAN, SUPERMAN, DEAD POOL, HAWK CAT, LADY THOR, MYSTIQUE, PRINCESS LEIA, BOBAFET BOBAFET WITH BOOBS. WALTER WHITE, WALTER QUITE WITH BOOBS. DAMN IT! I KNOW WHO I'M GOING AS NEXT YEAR.  AND WHILE THE AVENGERS AND MAD MAX AND BATMAN AN SUPERMAN WERE ALL THERE THIS YEAR, ONE SUPERHERO STOLE THE SHOW.
HOW ARE YOU DOING, COMIC CON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
IF I COULD ONLY GO BACK IN TIME AND SHOW THIS TO MY 13-YEAR-OLD SELF.
YES, I HOSTED THE HOBBIT THE BATTLE OF FIVE ARMIES, THE PANEL. AND EVERYBODY IN THE CAST WAS THERE, IT WAS A MAGICAL AFTERNOON. MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH COMIC CON AT ALL WAS THAT THIS WEEKEND I WAS REALLY HOPING TO SEE DANIEL RADCLIFFE WHO I KNEW WAS AT COMIC CON PUSHING HIS NEW FILM HORNS WHICH I AM NOT GOING TO MENTION ON MY SHOW. NO FREE RIDES, DANIEL. GOT TO SAY IT SOUNDS GOOD, GO SEE IT. I WANTED TO JUST SET HIM STRAIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING HE SAID ON A PRESS LINE LAST WEEK.
WHAT IS YOUR IDEAL POST SEX FOOD?
PROBABLY JUST BASED ON - I GUESS LIKE ICE CREAM.
ICE CREAM, REALLY?
AMERICONE DREAM. YEAH.
THAT'S A GOOD FLAVOR. STEPHEN COLBERT'S FLAVOR, RIGHT.
YOU HEARD HIM. HARRY POTTER REACHES FOR ME AFTER  DUMBLE-DOING IT. AND I'M NOT SURPRISED. I'M NOT SURPRISED. ICE CREAM IS THE OFFICIAL SNACK OF JUST HAVING HAD SEX OR GIVING UP ON IT ENTIRELY. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOLKS HERE'S MY BEEF WITH D-RADS. DANIEL, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT AMERICONE DREAM AFTER SEX, YOU''RE  SUPPOSED TO EAT IT DURING SEX. THAT'S WHAT THE WAFFLE CONE PIECES ARE FOR. THEY'RE RIBBED FOR YOUR PLEASURE. (LAUGHTER) SO ENJOY, PLEASE, ENJOY. BUT BY THE WAY, JUST A WARNING, JUST A WARNING, DO NOT TRY THIS WITH JIMMY FALLON'S FLAVOR LATE NIGHT CLAP (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, THESE DAYS-- THESE DAYS IT HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE FOR POLITICIANS TO ATTACK THE RICH. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY STICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK MY BONES BUT MY SECURITY TEAM WILL SHOOT YOU. SORRY SOCIALISTS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY. BEING RICH IS FANTASTIC IT IS WONDERFUL IT IS GARGLEGADONG, WHICH IS A WORD DESCRIBING THE PLEASURE OF WEALTH WHICH CANNOT BE TRANSLATED INTO POOR TALK. THE PROBLEM IS SOMETIMES WHEN I'M RICHIN' AROUND TOWN I WILL ACCIDENTALLY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF A NONRICH PERSON. THEN I GET A FUNNY FEELING IN MY HEART, APPARENTLY I HAVE AN ALLERGY TO NONWEALTHY PEOPLE CALLED EMPATHY. (LAUGHTER) MY DOCTOR SAID THERE MAY NEVER BE A CURE BECAUSE IT'S NOT A DISEASE. PLEASE, GIVE GENEROUSLY. FORTUNATELY THE FREE MARKET HAS FOUND THE WAY TO MAKE THE 1% FEEL 99% BETTER AND IT BRINGS ME TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SEE NO EQUAL. ALL TOO OFTEN WE SUPERWEALTHY FIND OURSELVES COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE MONEY DISABLED. BUT SOON, SOON WE COULD ALL BE SAVED THAT UNPLEASANTNESS THANKS TO THE EXAMPLE SET BY A NEW APARTMENT COMPLEX HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
THE CONTROVERSIAL RULING IN NEW YORK CITY. A DEVELOPER PLAN TO INCLUDE A POOR DOOR IN A LUXURY APARTMENT COMPLEX.
THE BUILDING WILL HAVE 219 UNITS OVERLOOKING THE WATERFRONT AND 55 AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT FACE THE STREET. THE IDEA, SPARKING BACKLASH BECAUSE IT REQUIRES  AFFORDABLE LIVING TENANTS TO ENTER THE BUILDING USING A SEPARATE DOOR THROUGH A BACK ALLEY.
Stephen: YES. A POOR DOOR BECAUSE IF I DON'T SEE SOMETHING, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT, IT DOESN'T EXIST. AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPY. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, IT'S JUST LIKE-- IT'S JUST LIKE THE OLD SAYING, OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF SIGHT. (LAUGHTER) AND I BELIEVE THAT SEPARATE DOORS ARE GREAT. AS ANOTHER LUXURY HOME BUILDER DAVID VON SPRECKELSON RECENTLY VON SPRECKELED, I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO EXPECT VERY HIGH INCOME HOMEOWNERS WHO PAID A FORTUNE TO LIVE IN THEIR BUILDING TO HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME BOAT AS LOW INCOME RENTERS WHO ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN A NEW BUILDING IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD. YES. THEY GET TO LIVE IN A NEW BUILDING IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD. WHAT ELSE DO THEY WANT. DIGNITY? NOW WHO'S GREEDY? AND FOLKS, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE'S A SOUND MORAL PRINCIPLE BEHIND SEPARATE WEALTH BASED ENTRANCES. JESUS HIMSELF SAID IT IS EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO  GO THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE THEN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. THAT'S WHY THE RICH NEED A SEPARATE ENTRANCE TO HEAVEN. THAT NEEDLE ONE SMELLS ALL CAMELLY. IF ANYTHING, FOLKS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I BELIEVE JUST ONE POOR DOOR IS NOT ENOUGH. BECAUSE IF I'M PAYING OVER $25 MILLION FOR A PENTHOUSE APARTMENT, WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO BE STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR WITH WHATEVER VAGRANT IS DWELLING IN THE 15 MILLION DOLLAR HOVEL ONE FLOOR BENEATH ME. UNDER 20 MILLION DOLLARS, WHAT IS THIS, BANGLEDESH? NO, POOR DOORS-- POOR DOORS ARE JUST THE LATEST IN A TREND THAT HELPS US HAVE'S NOT HAVE TO SEE THE HAVE NOTS. WE HAVES GET SKYBOXES INSTEAD OF BLEACHERS, PERSONAL SHOPPERS INSTEAD OF GOING TO A STORE AND AN AIRPORT'S FIRST CLASS HAS ITS OWN TSA LANE. I MEAN EVEN THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH IS HAPPIER FOR US BECAUSE WE CAN PAY UP TO AN EXTRA $500 AN HOUR TO SKIP TO THE FRONT OF LINES AT DISNEY WORLD. EVEN BETTER, WE GET TO MEET SNOW WHITE'S TOP SECRET 8th DWARF. (LAUGHTER) BUT AS EXCLUSIVE AS ALL THESE PERKS ARE, I THINK OCCASIONALLY I STILL RUN INTO AVERAGE PEOPLE LIKE MY CHAUFFEUR OR MY CHEF. AND I JUST GOT TO SAY, WHAT IS THE POINT OF BEING RICH IF YOU CAN'T BE LEFT ALONE WITH YOUR MONEY? THAT'S ALL WE ASK. (LAUGHTER) THERE MUST BE A SIMPLE WAY TO GET AWAY FROM AVERAGE PEOPLE. I DON'T NEED A PENTHOUSE. I WOULD SETTLE FOR SOMETHING SMALL AND LUXURIOUS. MAYBE A TINY SILK LINED APARTMENT WITH A PILLOW TO LAY MY HEAD ON. JUST ROOM FOR ONE. CARVED ON A SINGLE PIECE OF MAHOGONY WITH BRASS HANDLES FOR SIX OF MY SERVANTS TO CARRY ME TO MY COUNTRY PLACE. IT'S NOT A BIG PIECE OF LAND BUT AT LEAST IT'S IN A GATED COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
