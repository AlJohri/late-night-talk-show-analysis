(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS THE  TITULAR ROLE IN THE MOVIE "THE  HOBBIT."  PLEASE WELCOME MARTIN FREEMAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HEY MARTIN, GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: SIT DOWN, IS THIS  YOURS?
NO, IT WAS PLACED THERE.
Stephen: WELL, LET'S GET RID  OF THAT. IT COULD BE POISONED, WE'RE IN A  FANTASY WORLD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NOW YOU'RE BILBO. HAVE YOU SEEN THE FILMS? BECAUSE I HAVE.
I'VE SEEN IT TWICE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE ONE UP  ON ME. PLUS YOU'RE IN IT.
I AM IN IT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU ALSO -- YOU'RE  ALSO WELL KNOWN AS TIM FROM THE  ORIGINAL "OFFICE." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND DR. WATTSON FROM "SHERLOCK."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND NOW BILBO. ISN'T THAT A BURDEN THAT YOU ARE  PLAYING THESE ICONIC CHARACTERS? DID YOU EVER FEEL LIKE ANY ONE  OF THEM WAS GOING TO TRAP YOU?
I THINK I THOUGHT THAT ABOUT  TIM FOR A WHILE. DEFINITELY, YEAH. BECAUSE FOR A FEW YEARS THAT  FOLLOWED -- I MEAN, THE THING IS  -- LATE ME STATE FOR THE RECORD I'M PROUD OF "THE OFFICE," I'M  PROUD OF THAT PART, I LOVE THE  SHOW. BUT FOR A FEW YEARS I WAS  WISHING PEOPLE WOULD STOP  SHOUTING "TIM" AT ME IN THE  STREET.
Stephen: THEY'RE GOING TO  SHOUT BILBO AT YOU."
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT PART IS THERE  -- THEY SAY I'M NOT AN ACTOR, I  DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT  ACTORS. BUT YOU'RE AN ACTOR. IS THERE SOME PART OF BILBO THAT  HAS TO BE TRUE TO YOU? LIKE WHAT IS YOUR BILBO?
MY BILBO IS -- IT'S KIND OF  -- IT'S ALL OF US. WHAT I IMAGINE OR HOPE ALL OF US  TO BE, WHICH IS BASICALLY A  PEACE-LOVING PERSON WHO DOESN'T WANT TROUBLE IN HIS LIFE WHO IS  WRENCHED OUT OF HIS SITUATION ON  TO AN ADVENTURE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO KILL OR BE KILLED. WHICH I MY MOST OF US WOULD BE  QUITE SCARED OF.
Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT. BUT IN SOME WAYS YOU'RE KIND OF  -- YOU WENT THROUGH SORT OF A  BILBO EXPERIENCE WITH THIS FILM BECAUSE YOU WENT DOWN -- THEY  ALREADY SHOT "LORD OF THE RINGS
IS THIS POISOND?
Stephen: I MAKE NO  GUARANTEES. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL SEE HOW THE INTERVIEW  GOES. (LAUGHTER)  I WENT DOWN THERE.
I KNOW YOU DID.
Stephen: I WENT DOWN LAST  YEAR.
AND I MISSED YOU.
Stephen: I KNOW, JUST BARELY,  LIKE BY A DAY.
I THINK I WAS STILL ON  CHRISTMAS -- OR WAS IT DURING  --.
Stephen: IT WAS SUMMERTIME. (LAUGHTER)  I BELIEVE CHRISTMAS IS IN AUGUST
I CAME BACK AND MY MASSAGE  THERAPIST ANGELA SAID YOU HAD  BEEN --  (LAUGHTER) THAT'S HOW I GOT DOWN THERE. ANGELA BROUGHT ME A NOTE ON THE  HOBBIT STATIONERY THAT SAID  "COME HAVE FUN."  AND DID I.
I HEARD YOU WON A TOLKIEN  QUIZ AGAINST PHILIPPA, WHO IS A  BIG TOLKIEN HEAD.
Stephen: PETER JACKSON CAME  UP ME AT A PARTY FROM THE DWARS  AND HE SAID THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GEEKOFF.
Stephen:
AND YOU WON.
Stephen: I DID! I SAID TO PHILIPPA RIGHT BEFORE  I STARTED I SAID PREPARE  YOURSELF BECAUSE I AM LIKE AN ATHLETE WHO HAS TRAINED HIS  ENTIRE LIFE FOR A RACE HE NEVER  KNEW WAS COMING. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IT'S AGAINST YOU, BABY. IT WAS FANTASTIC, SHE WAS  GRACIOUS IN DEFEAT. NOW I -- I -- DID YOU READ THE  BOOKS GROWING UP? BECAUSE I'M A FANATIC ABOUT  "LORD OF THE RINGS."
I DIDN'T. I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MIDDLE  EFFORT AS AN ADULT IN THE RUNUP  TO DOING IT. I KNEW THE FILMS. VERY, VERY MUCH ENJOYED THE  FILMS, THOUGHT THEY WERE  BRILLIANT BUT I WASN'T -- ARE YOU BORED?
NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. I WAS JUST BRINGING UP -- I WAS  BRINGING YOU UP HERE.
Stephen: OH, WERE YOU? BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK  AS A CHILD BUT YOU ARE A CHILD'S  TOY. THAT'S YOU. (LAUGHTER)  THERE'S A LEGO YOU NOW.
THERE IS, BUT ALSO IF YOU  TURN HIS HEAD THERE IS A SCARED  ME. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S ME --  (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: FANTASTIC.
SO THAT HAS AS MANY FACIAL  ACTIONS AS I HAVE AS MARTIN IN  REAL LIFE. IT ALMOST OUTACTS ME.
Stephen: IT HAS YOUR  EMOTIONAL RANGE.
THE FULL A TO B, YEAH.
Stephen: BUT THIS IS THE  LEVEL FOR FAME. YOU'RE A VERY FAMOUS GUY.
WE ALL KNOW THIS, YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: BUT ARE YOU PREPARED  FOR THIS KIND OF ADULATION AND  LET'S CALL IT MARKET  PENETRATION?
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROUDEST  DAYS OF MY LIFE. ON THE LAST DAY OF SHOOTING WE  WERE ALL GIVEN OUR OWN LEGO  FIGURES. IT WAS GREAT. THAT WAS HONESTLY ONE OF THE  HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME. THE FACT THAT I'M LEGO, JESUS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: IS THERE A LEGO  LEGOLAS? (LAUGHTER)
YES, BUT HE'S A LEGLESS LEGO  LEGOLAS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU AND BENEDICT  CUMBERBATCH WHO PLAYS SHERLOCK  IN "SHERLOCK." HAVE YOU STARTED SHOOTING THE  NEXT SEASON YET?
NO, WE START IN MARCH.
Stephen: GET ON THE STICK,  OKAY? SOME OF US CANNOT WAIT FOR THE  REST OF IT.
THANKS.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE MAIN  CHARACTER OF BILBO AND HE IS THE  BIG SPECIAL EFFECT DRAGON. DO YOU GUYS DEBATE OVER WHO HAS  THE BETTER PART? (LAUGHTER)  WELL, IT'S A VERY GOOD PART.
Stephen: DRAG GONES ARE  INHERENTLY SEXY.
HOBBIT CANS HOLD THEIR OWN. YOU'RE IN RIVENDALE, DID YOU SEE  THAT?
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. CAN I ASK IN? IS THIS KOSHER? HOW DID YOU GET THIS?
Stephen: ARE YOU ASKING ME  WHETHER I HAVE VIOLATED  INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND SHOULD NEW LINE  COME AFTER ME IN A LAWSUIT?
IN SO MANY WORDS.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING ME. MARTIN FREEMAN. THE MOVIE IS "THE HOBBIT."
