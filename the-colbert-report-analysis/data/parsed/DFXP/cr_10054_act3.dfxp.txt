Stephen:  WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE NFL'S BEST DEFENSIVE ENDS. HERE TO TALK ABOUT OWLS, PLEASE WELCOME JUSTIN TUCK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen:  YOU ARE TWO TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION, TWO TIME PROBOWLER, 450 COMBINED TACKLES, 60 CAREER SACKS VOTED BY ESPN AS THE 100 TOP PLAYERS OF THE NFL. [CROWD CHEERING]
BEST DEFENSIVE TEAM, YOU GOT DENVER THE BEST OFFENSIVE TEAM. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. WHO IS GOING TO TAKE ON SUNDAY. I'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY RUNNING ON THIS. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY JUST A JOKE.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT GAME. I THINK THEY SAY THE WEATHER'S SUPPOSED TO BE BAD AND OBVIOUSLY THAT GIVES THE DEFENSE A LITTLE BIT OF THE EDGE. BUT PEYTON MANNING IS PRETTY AWESOME WHAT HE DOES. I'M GOING TO GO WITH A CLOSE ONE AND SAY SEATTLE SQUEAKS BY. [CROWD CHEERING]
Stephen:  OKAY. HAVE YOU EVER SACKED PEYTON MANNING.
ONLY IN THE PRO BOWL. IT DOESN'T COUNT.
Stephen:  SO YOU DIDN'T HIT HIM VERY HARD.
HE ACTUALLY SAW ME COMING AND KIND OF SAT DOWN.
Stephen:  HOW BIG OF A MAN ARE YOU?
I'M ABOUT SIX FIVE AND SOME CHANGE AND ABOUT 270.
Stephen:  DO YOU LIKE HITTING PEOPLE?
YES.
Stephen:  YOU DO.
THE ONLY REASON I PLAY THE GAME.
Stephen:  REALLY. YOU'RE IN IT FOR THE CRUNCH.
ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS THE ABSOLUTE MOST, I MEAN THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THIS. FOR ME AS A DEFENSIVE END, AND I SAW YOUR SKIT ABOUT QUARTERBACKS, I HATE QUARTERBACKS BY THE WAY SO YOU MAY NOT WANT TO TAKE THAT AS YOUR FALLBACK POSITION.
Stephen:  IF I WERE, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I'M WELL ON MY WAY.
YOU SURE YOU.
Stephen:  YOU SAW THE TOOLKIT I'M WORKING WITH RIGHT NOW. IF I WERE A QUARTERBACK, WHAT LOOK WOULD YOU GIVE ME RIGHT BEFORE I CALLED THE BALL.
CALLED THE BALL.
Stephen:  CALLED THE PLAY, CALLED THE BALL.
CALLED THE BALL.
Stephen:  CALLED THE BALL.
COME HERE BALL.
Stephen:  IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY, HERE BALL. OMAHA. IF I SAID OMAHA, OKAY. WHAT FACE WOULD YOU BE GIVING ME? [LAUGHTER] WE MIGHT HAVE TO STOP FOR A SECOND FOR ME TO CHANGE MY PANTS. IS THERE TIME. WE'LL KEEP GOING. OKAY. WHAT IS IT ABOUT HITTING PEOPLE THAT YOU ENJOY?
HONESTLY, I THINK ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A GOOD ONE, EVERYTHING HAPPENS LIKE THAT. BUT YOU HEAR THIS LIKE MM-MM, THAT NOISE, THAT SOUND. YOU HERE LIKE HUH, ANY OF THOSE LITTLE SOUNDS LIKE THAT, YOU KIND OF PUSH UP, YOU KIND OF HAVE THAT SMILE ON YOUR FACE.
Stephen:  THAT'S LIKE THE SOUND OF A CAT PURRING TO YOU. LET ME SHOW THE HELMET. THAT IS A MEAN LOOKING HELMET. THAT'S A DARTH VADER STYLE HELMET RIGHT THERE. WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE FIELD ARE YOU IN A DIFFERENT MIND SET WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CRITICIZING RICHARD SHERMAN FOR HIS ANTICS AND HE SAYS WHEN YOU'RE ON THE FIELD, YOU'RE IN A DIFFERENT MIND SET. YOU'RE THREE HOURS OF LIKE GO GO GO ON THE FIELD. LOOKING TO CRUNCH BONES AND COLLAPSE ORGANS, CAN YOU TURN THAT OFF.
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. AND WE ALWAYS CALL IT  THE WHITE LINE EFFECT. WHEN YOU STEP INSIDE THE WHITE LINES YOU'RE A DIFFERENT GUY. I MEAN LOOK, SEE ALL THAT. THAT'S FROM THOSE HITS THAT PEOPLE GO EEK WITH.
Stephen:  THESE DEEP GOUGES IN YOUR HELMET IS FROM THE FLESH OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. WHAT ABOUT THE INTERVIEW ON THE FIELD. DO YOU THINK HE WAS OVER THE LINE BY THE WAY.
NOT AT ALL.
Stephen:  I DON'T THINK SO EITHER.
NOT AT ALL. PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. RICHARD IS PRETTY SMART GUY. I MEAN STANFORD GRAD, 4.0GPA. GETTING HIS MASTERS NOW. PEOPLE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. YOU HAVE TO THINK HE'S A YOUNG GUY SENDING THE SEAHAWKS TO THE SUPER BOWL, JUST MADE A GREAT PLAY TO SEND THE TEAM TO THE SUPER BOWL AND YOU ASK HIM ABOUT IT HE'S GOING TO BE AMPED UP RIGHT THERE. LIKE HE SAID HE'S SORRY FOR THE FACT HE TOOK A LITTLE OF THE SHINE AWAY FROM THE TEAM WITH WHAT HE SAID BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANYTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR. THAT'S HOW I WANT PEOPLE TO BE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THEY DO. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HE'S THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES. SO I WAS PRETTY STOKED FOR HIM AND HAPPY HE WAS ABLE TO HELP HIS FOOTBALL TEAM WIN FOOTBALL GAMES.
Stephen:  THE GIANTS DID NOT MAKE THE SUPER BOWL THIS YEAR BUT THE SUPER BOWL IS BEING PLAYED IN YOUR STADIUM. ANY CHANCE YOU GUYS JUST RUSH THE FIELD AT SOME POINT? [LAUGHTER] [CROWD CHEERING]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
Stephen:  NEW YORK GIANTS DEFENSIVE END, JUSTIN TUCK
