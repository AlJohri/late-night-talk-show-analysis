IT HAD SORT OF-- WAS  SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE. AND IT WASN'T FUNNY. (LAUGHTER)
WE THOUGHT IT WAS  HILARIOUS. LIKE I CAME HOME, HE WAS  MOWING THE LAWN AND HE JUST  WAS LIKE HANGING OFF THE  LAWN MOWER AND JUST LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY THAT DAY. AND THEN-- DID YOU LAUGH.
I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.
WE ASKED OUR MANAGER IF  HE LIKED THE NAME. I SAID IT IS GOING TO BE BEN  FOLDS FIVE, HE SAID THERE'S  ONLY THREE OF YOU. AND I SAID IT'S SUPPOSED TO  BE FUNNY. HE SAID I GOT A GREAT SENSE  OF HUMOR AND THERE'S NOTHING  FUNNY ABOUT THAT NAME. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOUR MANAGER IS  A GANGSTER FROM THE 1930s.
A LITTLE BIT. SO OKAY, SO IT HAS BEEN 13  YEARS SINCE YOU HAVE DONE AN  ALBUM TOGETHER. WHAT'S LIKE MOST DIFFERENT  FOR YOU GUYS.

WELL, THE TITLE COMES  FROM A TRACT THAT NICK  HORNBY THE AUTHOR WROTE THE  LYRICS TOO. AND HE CORROBORATED WITH BEN  ON THE SONG.
