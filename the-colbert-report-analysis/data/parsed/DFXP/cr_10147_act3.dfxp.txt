(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, WELL COME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A GIVES SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS TO HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS, PLEASE WELCOME RANDALL MUNROE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, MR. MUNROE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW MR. MUNROE HERE, YOU ARE THE HUGO AWARD-WINNING CREATOR OF XKCD OKAY. THAT IS A-- ALL THE HIP KIDS KNOW IT'S A STICK-FIGURE COMIC STRIP READ BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EVERY WEEK. LET'S SETTLE THE FIRST THING. WHY IS IT CALLED XKCD
I KEPT PICKING DIFFERENT NAMES BASED ON WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN THINGS TO SET UP AN INTERNET ACCOUNT. I GOT TIRED OF BEING SKYWALKER 4 AND EVENTUALLY WANTED TO PICK SOMETHING THAT HAD NO MEANING AT ALL SO I WOULDN'T GET TIRED OF IT.
Stephen: BUT NOW IT MEANS YOU. NOW XKCD MEANS YOU.
YEAH, I SORT OF RUINED THAT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: OKAY. THE STYLE OF YOUR STRIP IS ONE OF THE SAME TIME VERY BASIC BUT ALSO VERY UNIQUE. LET'S SHOW THEM EXAMPLE OF YOUR SELF PORTRAIT. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. WHAT, WHY?
IS THIS THE BEST YOU CAN DRAW OR DO YOU JUST NOT WANT TO WASTE TIME ON IT?
DRAWING IS REALLY HARD. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND BUT YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO DO IT FOR A LIVING. NOW YOU DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WITH THIS STRIP. AND YOU HAVE TAKEN THAT EXTRAORDINARY THING AND MADE IT INTO A BOOK NOW. IT'S CALLED WHAT IF SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC ANSWERS TO ABSURD HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE SORT OF THING YOU WILL SOMETIMES DO IN THE STRIP. YOU WILL EXPLAIN SOMETHING COMPLICATED WITH YOUR DRAWINGS. AND IN THE SIMPLIST POSSIBLE SCIENTIFIC MATHEMATICAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL WAY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPLAIN IN THIS BOOK?
ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS PEOPLE ASK IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU TRY TO HIT A BASEBALL PITCHED AT 90% OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT.
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?
A LOT OF STUFF HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS REALLY QUICKLY. AND NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE GET OUT ALIVE.
Stephen: LIKE THERE'S A FIREBALL THAT INCINERATES THE PITCHER, RIGHT.
YEAH, THE BALL FUSES WITH THE AIR IN FRONT OF IT. AND YOU GET A SHELL OF X-RAYS THAT SWEEPS OUT AND IT STARTS DISINTEGRATING THE BATTER AND THE CATCHER AND ALSO THE PITCHER. THE PITCHER IS THE FIRST TO GO. AND A LOT OF THE EXAMPLES YOU HAVE IN THIS BOOKS END UP WITH PEOPLE, PLACES OR PLANETS BEING DESTROYED. WHY DO THOSE, WHY ARE THOSE THE KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT APPEAL TO YOU MOST?
I DON'T REALLY KNOW. PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE THAT AS A CONSEQUENCE. BUT I FEEL LIKE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME MILLIONS OF HOURS COLLECTIVELY WATCHING GIFS OF PEOPLE WALKING INTO SCREEN DOORS AND FALLING OFF OF THINGS. SO IT SEEMS LIKE NOT A SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO SEE AN ENTIRE PLANET CRASH INTO SOMETHING OR BLOW UP.
WE ACTUALLY HIT YOU WITH A COUPLE QUESTIONS BEFOREHAND HERE. I WONDER IF YOU HAVE HAD A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THESE. TAKE A STAB. THESE ARE SOME THAT WE POSED TO YOU BEFORE YOU CAME HERE TONIGHT. HOW MUCH DOES CANADA WEIGH? (LAUGHTER)
SO AND WE'RE TALKING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CORE OR JUST-- .
Stephen: JUST THE CANADA PART.
JUST THE SURFACE PART.
Stephen: INHABITABLE MANTLE.
IF YOU TAKE A SLICE THAT'S THE WHOLE THING, IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE 10 TO THE 23rd KILOGRAM. THE WHOLE RERT IS SOMETHING TO THE 24th.
Stephen: I WAS VERY CLOSE. I HAD 10 TO THE 22nd.
YEAH, BUT-- .
Stephen: RIGHT THERE, OKAY.
BUT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN TO EDUCATE US. BUT COULD YOU INCIDENTALLY THROUGH HUMOR AND THROUGH YOUR DRAWING, COULD YOU INCIDENTALLY EDUCATE LIKE KIDS ABOUT SCIENCE AND MATH?
YEAH, WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW I GOT STARTED DOING THIS WAS I TAUGHT A CLASS AT MIT FOR A WEEKEND AND THEY HAVE A PROGRAM WHERE YOU CAN COME IN AND TEACH A BUNCH OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS ON ANY SUBJECT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. THERE'S NO LIKE CHECKING CREDENTIALS OR ANYTHING. AND SO -- .
Stephen: REALLY, AND THEY JUST TRUST HIGH SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN WITH MEN WHO COME IN WITH NO CREDENTIALS.
YEAH, I HAD A COUPLE FRIENDS TEACHING CLASS, ONE DOING OPERATING SYSTEM DESIGN, ANOTHER ROOT BEER TASTING. AND I SAID I WILL TEACH A CLASS ON THE PHYSICS OF ENERGY. BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING I HAD BEEN STUDYING AND THINKING ABOUT A LOT AT THAT TIME. AND SO I DID, AND I HAD NEVER DONE A LECTURE BEFORE. SO I STARTED WALKING THESE KIDS THROUGH, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE EQUATIONS I LEARNED. I TRIED TO MAKE IT INTERESTING, BUT LIKE BY THE FIRST HOUR I COULD TELL THEY WEREN'T REALLY, THEY WEREN'T REALLY WITH ME. I RECOGNIZED THE BORED EXPRESSIONS, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THAT STUDENT SO MANY TIMES. SO I PULLED OUT AN EXAMPLE AND STARTED ANALYZING STAR TREK. (LAUGHTER) SO I STARTED-- I STARTED ANALYZING SCIENCE FICTION SCENES. SOW I SAID YODA WHEN HE PULLS THE XWING OUT OF THE SWAMP IN THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ENERGY BEING USED THERE.
Stephen: NO, A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORCE IS BEING USED THERE, I HATE TO CORRECT YOU.
RIGHT, WELL-- .
Stephen: RANDALL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: RANDALL MONROE, THE BOOK IS WHAT IF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
