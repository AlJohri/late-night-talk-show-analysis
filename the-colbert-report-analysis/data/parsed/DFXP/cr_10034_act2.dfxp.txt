Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: YOU KNOW I HAVE LONG WARNED YOU ABOUT SECULAR PROGRESSES, HUMANISTS OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THEMSELVES NOW. GLUTEN FREE. WE KNOW THEY'RE OUT TO DESTROY OUR CHRISTMAS. ONCE AGAIN IT FALLS TO ME TO LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST BIG SCROOGE. I HAVE LEARNED ABOUT A NEW THREAT TO CHRISTMAS. SO SCARY IT MADE ME DROP A LUMP OF COAL IN MY STOCKING. THIS IS THE BLITZKRIEG ON GRINCHITUDE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: FOLKS, LATEST THREAT [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: FOLKS, LATEST THREAT TO THE NORTH POLE COMES FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER.
CHRISTMAS IS COMING EARLY TO VENEZUELA. AS OF NOVEMBER 1st THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WOULD KICK OFF IN THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA YOU CAN MOVE CHRISTMAS. MOVE THE WHOLE HOLIDAY. VENEZUELA PRECEDENT NICHOLAS MADURO ANNOUNCED EARLY CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: HE CAN MOVE THE HOLIDAYS? THAT'S WHY IT'S SO WARM THERE IN FEBRUARY. I'M SHOCKED BY THE POWER GRAB BY NICHOLAS MADURO AND JIMMY KIMMEL'S SECURITY GUARD. NOT BECAUSE I THOUGHT VENEZUELA WAS THE HORN AT A SOCCER GAME TO ANNOUNCE THE START OF A RIOT. FRANKLY I'M FRANK-INCENSED BY MADURO'S SO-CALLED EXPLANATION FOR STARTING CHRISTMAS EARLY. LISTEN TO THIS GUY. MERRY CHRISTMAS 2013, CHRISTMAS EARLY VICTORY, EARLY HAPPINESS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. WE WANT TO DECLARE THE ARRIVAL OF CHRISTMAS. WE WANT HAPPINESS FOR EVERYBODY. HE DECLARED HAPPY NEW YEAR 2045, HAPPY ROY BOT BUTLER TIME. GUESS WHAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DID SOME RESEARCH. IT TURNS OUT THAT AMERICAN CHRISTMAS ISN'T UNTIL DECEMBER 25th. THANKS OBAMA CARE. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: SO, IF THE VENEZUELANS STARTED THEIR CHRISTMAS ON NOVEMBER 1st THAT MEANS THEY'RE GETTING --
Stephen: THIS MANY MORE WEEKS OF CHRISTMAS. HOW DID THE VENEZUELANS ACHIEVE THIS ACHIEVEMENT IN CHRISTMAS? THEY CREATED A NEW CABINET POSITION. A PROMOTION FROM THE UNDER SECRETARY OF ULTIMATE GIGGLES. AND MADURO'S REIGN OF FESTIVE DOESN'T END THERE HE ATTACKS THE HOLIDAY WE HOLD MORE SAKE R +ET RED THAN CHRISTMAS, BLACK FRIDAY.
I ORDERED THE MEDIATE OCCUPATION OF THIS CHAIN TO OFFER PRODUCTS TO THE PEOPLE AT FAIR PRICES. EVERYTHING, LET NOTHING REMAIN IN STOCK.
Stephen: EVERYTHING MUST GO, CRAZY NICK WON'T BE UNDER SOLD UNLESS HE'S OVER THRONE. FOLKS, I SAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: FOLKS, I SAY WE CONDITION ALLOW A YULETIDE GAP. AFTER ALL IF VENEZUELA CAN MOVE CHRISTMAS WHEN THEY WANT WHY CAN'T WE. WE DO IT WITH HANUKKAH. THE JEWS SHIFT THAT AROUND LOOKING FOR THE SWEET SPOT. THEY WILL GET IT ONE OF THESE DAYS. AFTER ALL THEY'RE VERY CLEVER PEOPLE. WHICH IS A COMPLIMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
