CHEERSES PLAUS.
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME  BACK, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO. NATION, CHRISTMAS MAY BE 43  DAYS AWAY BUT IT IS NEVER  TOO EARLY TO GET YOUR  SHOPPING DONE. IN FACT, I DID MINE IN 1986. KIDS YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE  YOUR NEW TANDY 102 PORTABLE  COMPUTER NOW WITH SPRING  LOADED KEY. IT'S LIKE YOUR WORDS ARE  SHOUTING AT YOU. BUT WITH CHRISTMAS RIGHT  AROUND THE CORNER THE  SECULAR SCROOGES HAVE  LAUNCHED THEIR LATEST BLITZKRIEG ON GRINCHITUDE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: FOLKS FOR ME  CHRISTMAS IS ALL ABOUT  TRADITION. TRIM THE TREE, WRAP THE  PRESENTS, HANG THE STOCKS,  UNTANGLE THE LIGHT, WASH MY  HANDS 17 TIMES, RETAEJ THE LIGHTS AND WRITE A LETTER TO  SANTA ASKING FOR MORE OCD  MEDICATION. FOLKS ONE OF THE MOST  CHERISHED TRADITIONS OF  CHRISTMAS IS READING THE  CLASSIC TWICE THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS. BUT NOW THAT'S OVER.
IN THIS VERSION OF IT WAS  THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS  IS GETTING SOME HOLIDAYER. >>, A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS THE JOLLY OLD ELF  KISSED HIS PIPE HABIT COLD  TURKEY. EDITING OUT TWO VERSES ABOUT  SMOKING.
THE VERSUS THE PIPE HE  HELD TIGHT AND THE SPOKEN  CIRCLED HIS HEAD LIKE A  WREATH.
Stephen: SANTA CAN'T QUIT  SMOKING. HE NEEDS THAT VICE. YOU TRY DEALING WITH THE  STRESS OF DELIVERING THE  WORLD'S TOYS IN A SINGLE  NIGHT. WE'RE LUCKY HE'S NOT DOING A  PA RUM PUM-PUM BUMP OFF  BLITZEN'S ASS. BESIDES, SECONDHAND SMOKE IS  HOW SANTA STUNTS THOSE KIDS'  GROWTH. EVEN WORSE, FOLKS, A NOTE  FROM SANTA ON THE BOOK BACK  SAYS HIS FURTHER IS FAKE. HOW DARE YOU PAINT SANTA AS  SOME KIND OF HIPPIE DIPPIE  PETA. HE EARNED THAT FUR BY  BAGGING HIMSELF AN A BOMB I  HADABLE SHOWMAN. FOLKS, THIS POLITICAL  CORRECTNESS MUST BE STOPPED. SURE, IT STARTS WITH NO  SMOKING AND FAKE FUR. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT WE'RE  DISSING HIGH FAT MILK AND  COOKIES, LIVING ON KALE  CHIPS AND COCONUT WATER. MARK MY WORDS SANTA IS GOING  TO STOP GIVING NAUGHTY KIDS  COAL AND START GIVING THEM COMPACT FOR ES-- FLORESCENT  BULBS BECAUSE IF THEY CAN  TAKE AWAY SANTA'S SMOKING THEY CAN TAKE AWAY ALL HIS  BAD HABITS. THEY WILL CUT OFF HIS EGG  NOTHING, MAKE HIM LOSE  WEIGHT AND NO MORE SATURDAY  NIGHTS WITH HIS HO-HO-HO.  --'S BE RIGHT BACK.
