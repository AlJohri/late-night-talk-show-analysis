Stephen:  WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I FOR ONE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS BECAUSE THE POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES, AS OPPOSED TO 2012'S CANDIDATE, A RICH EMBARRASSMENT. AND I'M ESPECIALLY INTRIGUED BY FLORIDA SENATOR AND A MAN LEGALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE PRESIDENT, MARCO RUBIO. OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TO REPUBLICANS, THE MEDIA ASK-STAPO IS ALWAYS PLAYING YOU ITS GOTCHA GAMES. BUT RUBIO IS NO RUBE E-O.
YOUNG VOTERS HAVE ASKED ME AND THEY'RE CURIOUS TO KNOW. HAVE YOU EVER SMOKED MARIJUANA?
YOU KNOW WHY I NEVER ANSWER THAT QUESTION? I'LL TELL YOU WHY I NEVER ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IF I TELL YOU I HAVEN'T, YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.
Stephen:  YEAH, NOBODY WOULD EVER BELIEVE THIS GUY'S NOT A STONER. I MEAN WE ALL SAW HIS NATIONALLY TELEVISED EPIC CASE OF COTTON MOUTH. BUT, RUBIO CAN'T ADMIT THAT HE'S BURNED DOWN. HE'S TRYING TO WIN OVER REPUBLICANS, THE PARTY THAT BROUGHT US "JUST SAY NO," FIRST AS A DRUG POLICY, THEN AS THEIR ENTIRE PLATFORM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THAT'S WHY HE IS ALWAYS READY TO NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
IF I TELL YOU THAT I HAVEN'T, YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME. AND IF I TELL YOU THAT I DID, THEN KIDS WILL LOOK UP TO ME AND SAY I CAN SMOKE MARIJUANA BECAUSE LOOK HOW HE MADE IT.
Stephen:  YEAH, THINK OF THE MESSAGE THAT WOULD SEND ALL THE TEEN GIRLS STARING UP AT HIS POSTER ON THEIR BEDROOM WALLS BECAUSE RUBIO'S YOUTH APPEAL, WHICH IS WIDE, HAS HAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES BEFORE.
WHEN I WROTE MY BOOK "AMERICAN SON," I HAD A SEGMENT IN THE BOOK ABOUT HOW I WASN'T A VERY GOOD HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. I HAD A 2.1 GPA, I GOOFED AROUND IN CLASS. SO ONE DAY SOMEBODY SAID I ENJOYED YOUR BOOK BUT MY SON CAME UP TO ME AND SAID HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GET GOOD GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE LOOK AT MARCO RUBIO. HE DIDN'T DO WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND LOOK HOW SUCCESSFUL HE HAS BEEN.
Stephen:  SEE, KIDS MIGHT LOOK AT RUBIO'S SUCCESS AND SAY MAYBE I CAN SAVE MONEY BY CUTTING MY OWN HAIR, TOO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE POINT IS-- THE POINT IS HE IS NOT GOING TO MISUSE HIS STATUS AS A YOUTH ICON TO HOOK KIDS ON DRUGS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HE'S EVER SMOKED POT, RUBIO'S OFFICIAL POSITION IS HE WOULD LIKE TO BE PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS A MESSAGE OF HOPE THAT IS RESONATING WITH KIDS ALL OVER AMERICA, LIKE THE YOUNG MAN I MENTOR, DAVID. DAVID, COME ON OUT HERE. DAVID, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). DAVID, THANKS SO MUCH. HAVE A SEAT THERE, DAVID. DAVID IS A GOOD KID. DAVID IS PART OF MY URBAN OUTREACH PROGRAM. ( LAUGHTER ) WHERE I REACH OUT OF THE URBAN AREAS INTO SOME WEALTHIER SUBURBS. THANKS FOR BEING HERE, DAVID.
THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen:  DAVID, YOU'RE A HUGE MARCO RUBIO FAN, RIGHT?
YEAH, BECAUSE HE'S SO SUCCESSFUL. DID YOU KNOW MY MAN RUBE DOG HELPED DROP THE SENATE IMMIGRATION BILL BEFORE BACKING AWAY FROM IT ULTIMATELY VOTING FOR IT ONLY TO SEE IT GO NOWHERE IN THE HOUSE. HE'S THE MAN! ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen:  OKAY, OKAY, BUT, DAVID, DO YOU SLACK OFF IN SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU HEARD SENATOR RUBIO DID?
STEPHEN, LET ME TELL YOU WHY I NEVER ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IF I SAID I'M NOT SLACKING OFF, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. AND IF I DID SAY I AM SLACKING OFF I'D BE SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE FOR ALL THE MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS WHO LOOK UP TO ME BECAUSE I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Stephen:  OH-- OH-- OKAY. SO ARE YOU NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE INFLUENCED BY MARCO RUBIO'S NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS?
LET ME YOU WHY I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, STEPHEN. IF I TELL YOU --
Stephen:  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH, DAVID. JUST ANSWER THIS MUCH-- DO YOU, A YOUNG PERSON WHO WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE IN 2016, THINK MARCO RUBIO COULD BE ELECTED PRESIDENT?
WHAT ARE YOU HIGH? ( LAUGHTER ) LET ME TELL YOU WHY I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
Stephen:  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
