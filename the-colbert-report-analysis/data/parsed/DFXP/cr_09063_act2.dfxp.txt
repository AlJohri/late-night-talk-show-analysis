Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, WE ALL KNOW THAT THE  OBAMA PRESIDENCY IS ONE OF THE  MOST SECRETIVE IN HISTORY. THERE HASN'T BEEN AN  ADMINISTRATION THIS PRIVATE  SINCE THE SECRET PRESIDENCY OF ROCKY T. PENDERGRASS, WHO MADE  HIS NAME BY INVADING TERABITHIA. [LAUGHTER] DON'T BELIEVE ME? LOOK IT UP IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. YOU WON'T FIND IT. [LAUGHTER] WELL THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS  DOING IT AGAIN.
DID YOU SEE THE PICTURES OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYING GOLF  WITH TIGER WOODS THIS WEEKEND? NEITHER DID WE.
THE MEDIA COVERING THE  PRESIDENT WAS SHUTOUT. THE PRESS CORPS COMPLAINED.
FOX NEWS' ED HENRY SPEAKING  IN HIS ROLE AS WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT SAID, "IT IS NOT ABOUT  GOLF. IT'S ABOUT TRANSPARENCY  AND ACCESS IN A BROADER SENSE."
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE IN  ALL FAIRNESS DUE TO TRANSPARENCY  RELEASED SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM EITHER TEEING OFF WITH TIGER  OR PERHAPS WHEN THEY FINISHED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO  SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES IS DOING.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. ABOUT A FREE PRESS HOLDING OUR  LEADER ACCOUNTABLE. I MEAN IT'S ONE THING TO KEEP  US IN THE DARK ABOUT A FLEET OF  FLYING ROBO-ASSASSINS. BUT A ROUND OF GOLF ON YOUR DAY  OFF? WHERE'S THE JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT? OH, I SUPPOSE WHITE HOUSE  LAWYERS HAVE DRAWN UP SOME  CONVOLUTED LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR USING A FIVE-WOOD ON A PAR  THREE! THERE ARE A LOT OF HOLES IN THIS  STORY, FOLKS. SPECIFICALLY, 18. AMERICA DESERVES TO KNOW! WHO DROVE? WHO RODE SHOTGUN? DID THE PRESIDENT HIT FROM  LADIES' TEE? DID HE REPLACE HIS DIVOTS? OR DID HE SEND SUSAN RICE TO  COVER THEM UP? [AUDIENCE REACTS] [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE JUST AS UPSET AS I AM. I CAN TELL. IT'S BAD! BUT FOLKS, WATER-HAZARD-GATE--  TRADEMARK-- IS JUST THE TIP OF  THE SECRETBERG. NOT GONNA TRADEMARK THAT ONE. [LAUGHTER] THIS WHOLE EPISODE MAKES ME  REALIZE JUST HOW LITTLE WE KNOW  ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING EVERY MOMENT. BECAUSE I HAVE IT ON GOOD  AUTHORITY THAT MULTIPLE TIMES A  DAY HE LOCKS HIMSELF ALONE INSIDE A SMALL, TILED ROOM. [LAUGHTER] SOMETIMES HE ENTERS WITH GREAT  URGENCY, ONLY TO EMERGE LATER  WITH A LOOK OF SERENITY. [LAUGHTER] WHAT DOES HE DO IN THERE? ALL WE KNOW IS THAT BY THE TIME  HE LEAVES THE SUDOKU IS  FINISHED. [LAUGHTER] I KNOW -- I KNOW. HE'S APOLL GIFTS SAY IT'S ALL  INNOCENT BUT FOLKS THIS DOES NOT  PASS THE SMELL TEST. [AUDIENCE REACTS] AGAIN, I'M  ANGRY AS WELL. MR. PRESIDENT, OPEN THAT DOOR TO  THE PRESS CORPS, OTHERWISE I CAN  ONLY ASSUME YOU ARE SO ARROGANTLY ANTI-DEMOCRATIC THAT  YOU ARE IN THERE SITTING ON SOME  SORT OF THROWN. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT
