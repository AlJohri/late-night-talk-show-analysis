(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY, MY GUEST TONIGHT ARE  AN INDY ROCK GROUP MAKING THEIR FIRST T.V. APPEARANCE, BUT. PLEASE WELCOME THE POSTAL  SERVICE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ♪   HEY, JIMMY, HEY, BEN, THANKS FOR  COMING ON. ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE. JENNY, JIMMY, THIS IS YOUR FIRST  TIME ON THE SHOW. WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: BEN, WELCOME BACK.
THANK YOU.
NOW COLLECTIVELY YOU GUYS ARE  KNOWN AS THE POSTAL SERVICE AND  YOU PUT OUT AN ALBUM TEN YEARS AGO CALLED "GIVE UP."  AND AN ALBUM --  (LAUGHTER). -- A TITLE I GUESS YOU TOOK TOO  SERIOUSLY? (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE YOU'VE'VE NEVER PUT OUT  ANOTHER ALBUM BUT YOU'RE  CELEBRATING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY ON A TOUR. HOW DO YOU DO AN ALBUM LIKE THIS  LIVE? BECAUSE -- I MEAN THIS IN THE  BEST POSSIBLE WAY, BLEEP  PWHRORP. IT'S A LITTLE BLEEP BLORP. HOW DO YOU DO THAT LIVE IN FRONT  OF AN AUDIENCE? JIMMY?
A LOT OF COMPUTERS AND A LOT  OF DANCING.
Stephen: NOW YOU LAY THE  COMPUTER, RIGHT?
UH-HUH.
Stephen: NOW WHY DID YOU  CHOOSE THAT INSTRUMENT? DID YOU GO TO LIKE THE MUSIC  STORE AS A KID AND IT WAS CLOSED  BUT THE BEST BUY WAS OPEN NEXT  DOOR? (LAUGHTER)  WHAT WAS MARCHING BAND LIKE?
I COULDN'T GET INTO PIANO  LESSONS AND SO -- COMPUTERS --  (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: AND HOW DID YOU  GUYS CREATE THIS ALBUM  ORIGINALLY TEN YEARS SOMETHAT  THAT.
WELL, JIMMY WOULD SEND ME  C.D.s WITH KIND OF MUSIC BEDS  ON THEM AND THEN I WOULD KIND OF PUT THEM IN MY COMPUTER AND KIND  OF TRY TO CREATE SONGS OUT OF  WHAT HE SENT ME. EVERYTHING HE SENT ME WAS  STRUCTURED. THEN I WOULD WRITE WORDS AND  MELODIES AND ADD LITTLE THINGS,  GUITARS, KEY BOARDS AND STUFF AND SEND THE TRACKS BACK TO HIM  THEN HE WOULD PUT THEM IN HIS  COMPUTER.
Stephen: YOU'D SEND THEM AS  E-MAIL FILES OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT? (LAUGHTER)
IN 2003 IT WAS KIND OF BEFORE  YOU COULD SEND HUGE FILES LIKE  THAT EASILY. I THINK I HAD A DIAL-UP  CONNECTION AT THAT POINT. (LAUGHTER)  SO WE'VE KIND OF SENT THEM  LITERALLY THROUGH THE MAIL,  HENCE THE NAME THE POSTAL  SERVICE. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Stephen: OH, OKAY! I SEE. SO IF YOU WERE -- IF YOU'RE --  IF YOU WERE DOING YOUR ALBUM  TODAY IT MIGHT BE CALLED LIKE COME CAST HIGH SPEED INTERNET? SOMETHING LIKE THAT? (LAUGHTER)  NOW HOW DID YOU GET MIXED UP  WITH THESE TWO GUYS, JENNY? YOU HAD YOUR OWN SUCCESSFUL  CAREER. LET'S LOOK AT YOUR EARLIER WORK. ♪ I DON'T WANT TO GROW UP, I'M A  TOYS "R" US KID  ♪ WOULDN'T BE A TOYS "R" US KID (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WOW. WOW.
Stephen: DO YOU EVER LORD  THAT OVER THESE GUYS AND SAY  "YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE REALLY FAMOUS"?
(LAUGHS)  NO BUT I WILL NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET  MIXED UP?
BEN AND I WERE ON THE SAME  RECORD LABEL OUT OF SEATTLE AND  I WAS OUT IN NEBRASKA RECORDING A RECORD WITH RILO KILEY AND MY  CELL PHONE THAT I JUST PURCHASED  RANG.
Stephen: THEY HAD THOSE IN  2003?
IT WAS A HUGE THING AND IT  WAS BEN GIBBARD ON THE PHONE AND  HE ASKED ME TO SING ON THE RECORD AND I HAD NEVER MET BEN. I'D NEVER SEEN A PICTURE OF BEN.
Stephen: WOULD THAT HAVE  CHANGED ANYTHING? (LAUGHTER)
SO I WENT BACK TO L.A. AND  BEN ASKED IF I WOULD PICK HIM UP  FROM THE AIRPORT AND I ROLLED UP IN A 15-PASSENGER VAN AND HAD A  SIGN THAT SAID "BEN GIBBARD" ON  IT. SO HE GOT IN THE VAN AND WE WENT  TO GO MEET JIMMY WHO I HAD NEVER  MET BEFORE. WE SHARED MARGARITAS AND  RECORDED MY VOCALS I THINK IN A  DAY.
Stephen: SO THIS IS TEN  YEARS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE  ALBUM BEING RELEASED, YOUR NEW OLD ALBUMS "GIVE UP."  ARE YOU GOING TO DO A SECOND  ALBUM?
UM --  (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: (LAUGHS)  UH-HUH. YOU HAVE THE SAME DELIVERY  PHILOSOPHY AS THE ACTUAL POSTAL  SERVICE. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BEN, JIMMY, JENNY, HOW ABOUT  SOME SONGS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A  PERFORMANCE FIRST TIME ON  TELEVISION BY THE POSTAL  SERVICE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
