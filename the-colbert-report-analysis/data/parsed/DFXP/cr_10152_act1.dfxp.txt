STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen:  WELCOME TO THE REPORT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, CITIZENS. SIT DOWN! PLEASE! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MEMBERS OF THE NATION, CITIZENS ASSEMBLED DIGNITARIES. SMOKE 'EM IF YOU'VE GOT THEM. METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE. NEW YORK STATE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW TO YOU SMOKE INDOORS. AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED ALL OF OUR FIGHTING-AGE MEN AND WOMEN HEALTHY AND STRAPPING BECAUSE AT EXACTLY-- OOOOH. I FORGOT TO WIND MY WATCH LAST NIGHT--  WHATEVER TIME IT IS, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAS HEARD  THE CALL OF BATTLE ONCE AGAIN. THIS GREAT NATION IS AT WAR. SORRY FOR THE QUESTION MARK. I JUST HAD TO SLAP THAT ON BECAUSE I COULDN'T QUITE TELL FROM OBAMA'S SPEECH LAST NIGHT EXACTLY-- ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, UH, THIS, WHAT-- WHAT ARE WE DOING AGAIN?
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, FOLLOWING CONSULTATIONS WITH ALLIES ABROAD AND CONGRESS AT HOME, I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT AMERICA WILL LEAD A BROAD COALITION TO ROLL BACK THIS TERRORIST THREAT. OUR OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR-- WE WILL DEGRADE AND ULTIMATELY DESTROY ISIL THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE AND SUSTAINED COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY.
Stephen:  GOT IT. THIS GREAT NATION IS. AT. COMPREHENSIVE AND SUSTAINED COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE POINT IS, THE POINT IS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE GOING BACK TO IT IRAQ SO WE CAN FINALLY COMPLETE THE TRILOGY. AND THEN THROW THE FEDERAL BUDGET INTO MOUNT DOOM. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WHAT WHILE I UNQUESTIONABLY SUPPORT OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) SIR, WE'RE FIGHTING ISIS. WHY CAN'T YOU GET THEIR NAME RIGHT?
THE TERRORIST GROUP KNOWN AS ISIL. ISIL. ISIL. ISIL.
Stephen:  NOW, I AGREE THEY'RE ACTING LIKE A BUNCH OF ISILs. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT, SIR, TECHNICALLY, TECHNICALLY, IT'S ISIS. IF YOU JUST SLAM AN "L" ON THE END OF WORDS WILLY-NILLY WHENEVER YOU WANT, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. I, MEAN. YOU'LL THINK YOU'RE BOMBING SYRIA, AND INSTID END UP BOMBING CEREAL WHICH-- WHICH I SUPPORT, BY THE WAY. SUNNY CUCKOO IS A MAD MAN WHO MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IT'S NOT--  AND IT'S NOT JUST THEIR NAME HE GOT WRONG. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE NAME STANDS FOR.
ISIL IS NOT ISLAMIC. NO RELIGION CONDONES THE KILLING OF INNOCENTS.
WHY WON'T HE CALL ISIS WHAT THEY REALLY ARE--  SLAMIC EXTREMISTS.
HE SAID THE ISLAMIC STATE IN THE LEVANT IS NOT ISLAMIC. HELLO? HOW-- HOW DO YOU PARSE THAT ADJECTIVE OR NOUN OR VERB. IF AN ISLAMIST IS NOT AN ISLAMIST, DOES THE BIRD TWEET IN THE TREE? ( LAUGHTER ) Stephen: IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION, SIR. DOES OR DOES NOT THE BIRD TWEET IN THE TREE? IF SOMETHING CALLS ITSELF SOMETHING, IT IS THAT THING, JUST LIKE ALL ENGLISH MUFFINS ARE BAKED IN ENGLAND. AND CANADIAN BACON IS MADE FROM CANADIANS. THEY'RE A WELL-MARBLED PEOPLE. BUT, FOLKS, I-- IT'S NOT JUST "ISLAMIC" HE WOULDN'T SAY. BRITT HUME NOTICED THAT THERE ARE OTHER WORDS THAT DID NOT  APPEAR IN THE SPEECH.
IT SEEMS THAT ONE WOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT. HE DIDN'T QUITE GO THAT FAR. HE SAID WE'D DO WHAT IT TAKES. HE DIDN'T SAY WE'D DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
Stephen:  HE DIDN'T SAY THE WORD "WHATEVER." I MEAN, AT LEAST HE COULD HAVE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO KILL  ISIS OR WHATEVS. WORDS MATTER, SIR. WORDS MATTER. OR, WHATEVER, WHATEVER, MR. PRESIDENT. THEN, MY FRIEND BRITT HERE PERFECTLY SUMMED UP WHAT FELT SO WRONG ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S TONE.
THERE IS A CERTAIN UN-- WHAT I MIGHT CALL A CERTAIN UNCERTAINTY IN ALL OF THIS IN THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET HE IS BLOWING. WHEN YOU BLOW AN UNCERTAIN TRUMPET AND COMMIT TO DOING LESS THAN YOU COULD AND-- AND-- AND --
Stephen:  AND, AND HAMANA HAMANA HAMANA HAMANA. YES, OBAMA IS BLOWING AN UNCERTAIN TRUMPET. WELL SAID, BRITT, SPOKEN BY A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO BLOW A RUSTY TROMBONE. BUT PERHAPS-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES -- OH, YES. AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE FEEL WHEN HE BLOWS IT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT PERHAPS, PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT'S FIERCEST CRITIC WAS JOHN McCAIN, WHO WAS EVERYWHERE LAST NIGHT. HE WAS A GUEST ON CNN. HE WAS A GUEST ON MSNBC. HE WAS A GUEST ON FOX NEWS. HE WAS A SECRET INGREDIENT ON "CHOPPED." I THOUGHT IT WAS SO INVENTIVE TO PAN FRY HIM WITH A CORN FLAKE CRUST. ( LAUGHTER ) AND McCAIN'S MESSAGE WAS AS CLEAR AS IT WAS SELF-CONGRATULATORY.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS NOW FORCED TO LISTEN TO WHAT, FRANKLY, LINDSEY GRAHAM AND I HAVE BEEN ARGUING FOR. OUR WITHDRAWAL FROM ALL OF OUR TROOPS FROM IRAQ, WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN TODAY. IF WE HAD LEFT A RESIDUAL FORCE, THE SITUATION WOULD NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY. WE HAD IT WON, THANKS TO THE SURGE. IT WAS WON.
Stephen:  YES, IT WAS WON. ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS KEEP A RESIDUAL FORCE IN IRAQ FOR-- LET'S SAY, EVER. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN, TODAY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TERRORISM THERE EXCEPT FOR THE TERRORISM WE HAD WHEN WE WERE THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) PROBLEM-- SAMED. AND JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT BARACK OBAMA FORGOT TO THANK LAST NIGHT. THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" JOURNALED THE REAL MESSAGE OF OBAMA'S SPEECH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DICK CHENEY WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG. SEEING THOSE WORDS IN PRINT MUST MELT WHATEVER IS IN PLACE OF HIS HEART. I'M GOING TO SAY AN EGG TIMER DUCT TAPED TO A FITBIT. AND, FOLKS, AND, FOLKS, I GOTTA SAY-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HUGE, HUGE CHENEY FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IF DICK CHENEY GOT IT RIGHT, SO DID HIS LITTLE BUDDY-IN-CHIEF --   WHO GOT IT RIGHT BEFORE THE SURGE IN 2007.
PRESIDENT BUSH ISSUED THIS FRIGHTENINGLY ACCURATE, AS IT TURNS OUT, ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.
WE BEGIN WITHDRAWING BEFORE OUR COMMANDERS TELL US WE ARE READY WOULD BE DANGEROUS FOR IRAQ, FOR THE REGION, AND FOR THE UNITED STATES. IT WOULD MEAN SURRENDERING THE FUTURE OF AL-- OF IRAQ TO AL QAEDA. IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE'D BE RISKING MASS KILLINGS ON A HORRIFIC SCALE. IT WOULD MEAN INCREASING THE PROBABILITY THAT AMERICAN TROOPS WOULD HAVE TO RETURN AT SOME LATERIDATE DATE TO CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT IS EVEN MORE DANGEROUS.
HOW EERIE.
Stephen:  YES. HOW EERIE. IT'S LIKE HE'S SOME KIND OF PROPHET. WHAT'S THAT GUY'S NAME. NOSTRA-DUMBASS. YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HE SAW IS COMING. BECAUSE IT REALLY EYE GOTTA SAY, LISTENING TO THAT, IT REALLY SEEMS AS IF BUSH COULD SEE THE FUTURE IN 2007. IF ONLY HE COULD HAVE SEEN IT IN 2003. OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD, FOLKS! IF HIS PREDICTIONS WERE RIGHT ABOUT THIS, THAT MEANS HIS PREDICTIONS WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING.
I ASK YOU TO PASS LEGISLATION TO PROHIBIT THE MOST EGREGIOUS ABUSES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH, CREATING HUMAN-ANIMAL HYBRIDS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  FOLKS, FOLKS, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? I AM NOW PREDICTING THAT AFTER THIS WAR, THE NEW PRIME MINISTER OF IRAQ WILL BE A PRIME MINITTOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
