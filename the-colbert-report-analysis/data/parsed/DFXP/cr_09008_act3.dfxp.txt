STEPHEN: MY GUEST TONIGHT  HAS A BOOK THAT CRITICIZES  PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO RICH. I'LL MAKE HER BOOK A BESTSELLER  SO SHE CAN SEE HOW HURTFUL THAT  IS. PLEASE WELCOME CHRYSTIA  FREELAND! GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING BACK. YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK I FIND  OFFENSIVE. IT'S CALLED "PLEUT CRATES THE  RISE OF SUPERRICH AND THE FALL  OF EVERYONE ELSE."  WHY IS THAT A SNROB. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SUPER-- WHY IS THAT A  PROBLEM? THE SUPER RICH HAVE SUPER EARNED  ALL THEIR SUPER WEALTH. THIS SAY VIEW THAT MANY OF THE  SUPER RICH HAVE. AND ACTUALLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE  SUPER RICH CONCEPTS WHICH, I  TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK IS  SOMETHING THAT FOSTER FREEZE. HE FUNDED RICK SANTORUM IN THE  PRIMARY.
ACE GOOD MAN.
HE INTRODUCED ME TO THE  CONCEPT OF THE SELF PAC. HE TALKED ABOUT HIS FRIENDS WHO  FUND SYMPHONIES OR MUSEUMS OR  FILL TROPIC PROJECTS. HE SAID WHY SHOULD I GIVE MY  MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT TO SPEND  ON WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS. I SELF TAX MYSELF AND SPEND MY  MONEY ON RICK SANTORUM.
STEPHEN: IF YOU WATCHED THE  PRIMARIES RICK SANTORUM WAS A  TAX ON ALL OF US.
WAS IT MONEY WELL SPENT?
STEPHEN: I LIKE THAT IDEA. HE SAID BY GIVING TO MONEY BY  CHARITY IT'S I TAX MYSELF.
IT'S A SELF TAX. IT'S BETTER THAN HAVING THE  GOVERNMENT SPEND MONEY BECAUSE  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT AS SMART  AS THE SUPER RICH WHICH SPEND MONEY THE WAY THEY WANT WHICH IS  BETTER FOR ALL OF US.
STEPHEN: WE MAY NOT NEED  ROADS OR SCHOOLS BUT WE NEED THE  BALLET.
YOU MIGHT NOT NEED AIR  TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS BECAUSE YOU  MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE JET.
STEPHEN: I DO HAVE I -- I  HAVE A PRIVATE JET.
THERE YOU GO.
STEPHEN: WHAT UPSET ME MOST  IS I'M NOT ONE OF THE SUPER  RICH.
HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE?
STEPHEN:LY NOT TELL YOU. THE SUPER RICH WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT IS THE .001% AND HIGHER.
AND UP.
STEPHEN: THE 1%EVES LIKE ME  ARE THE 99% COMPARED TO THOSE  PEOPLE.
EXACT IT WILL RIGHT.
STEPHEN: SHOULD I BE  OCCUPYING THEM? I BET IT'S A LOVELY PLACE TO  OCCUPY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE IS THE THING AND THIS IS  THE NEW THING ABOUT THE SUPER  RICH, THEY ARE GLOBAL. AND IN THE 20th CENTURY THE  AMERICAN SUPERRICH NEEDED THE  AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS TO HAVE  ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THE STUFF THE SUPER RICH WERE CREATING. THIS IS THE FAMOUS HENRY FORD  THEORY. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR STUFF  PURCHASED BY THE INDIAN MIDDLE  CLASS, THE CHINESE MIDDLE CLASS  AND YOU DON'T RELY SO MUCH ON A PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS. I THINK THIS IS POLITCALLY A  SERIOUS PROBLEM AND PART OF THE  REASON WE'RE SEEING SUCH  POLARIZATION IN THE AMERICAN  DEBATE.
STEPHEN: THE SUB TITLE IS  THE RISE OF GLOBAL SUPERRICH AND  THE FALL OF EVERYONE ELSE.
YES.
STEPHEN: IF THAT IS TRUE,  SHOULDN'T I HITCH A RIDE WITH  THE SUPER RICH? OR AT LEAST JUST DO EVERYTHING I  CAN TO GET UP IN THE SUPER RICH. I DON'T WANT TO FALL. SHOULDN'T I CUT THE DEAD WEIGHT  OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND GET UP  THERE WITH THE SUPER RICH AND  SAY I'VE GOT MIND JACK AND WATCH THEM TUMBLE DOWN?
THIS IS THE TRAGEDY OF  AMERICA TODAY. IF ALL OF US IN OUR OWN  INDIVIDUAL LIKE DECISIONS, WE  SEE THIS. THIS IS NOT A HIDDEN PHENOMENON. IT'S A WINNER TAKE ALL ECONOMY. AND WE'RE DESPERATE TO GET  OURSELVES INTO THAT PLACE AND  OUR CHILDREN. YOU KNOW, WHY IS THERE SO MUCH  APPRECIATE SURE GET INTO THE  BEST KINDERGARTEN? TO GET INTO THE BEST ELEMENTARY  SCHOOL? IT'S NOT BECAUSE PARENTS PARENTS ARE  CRAZY. IT'S BECAUSE PARENTS SEE THAT  THIS IS A WINNER TAKE ALL  SOCIETY. THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO BE AMONG  THE WINNERS BUT IN TERMS OF  COLLECTIVE GOOD THIS IS NOT A  GREAT WAY TO RUN THINGS, IS IT? [  APPLAUSE  ]
STEPHEN: THOMAS JEFFERSON  HIMSELF SAID -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHEN A PLAWD FOR PEOPLE  OTHER THAN ME, IT HURTS. [ LAUGHTER ] CRIST CLINTON CRIST  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME.
