Stephen:  WHOOO! WELCOME TO THE REPORT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen:  THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, IN HERE, OUT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, COLBERT NATION, ONE AND ALL, IT IS THE FINAL NIGHT OF MY EPIC, SUPERB OWL COVERAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'M PROUD TO SAY, FOLKS, I AM PROUD TO SAY IT HAS BROUGHT A LOT OF NEW VIEWERS TO THE SHOW-- MAINLY OWLS. AT LEAST NOW SOMEONE IS WATCHING OUR 1 A.M. RERUN. FOLKS, I'M AFRAID WHAT I LEARNED THIS WEEK ISN'T ALL SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS BECAUSE THERE'S AN OMINOUS CLOUD WAFTING OVER FOOTBALL.
A NEW PUSH TO ALLOW MEDICINAL MARIJUANA USE IN THE NFL.
SHOULD THE NFL REEXAMINE ITS MARIJUANA POLICY?
WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT MEDICAL MARIJUANA IF THERE IS PROOF THAT IT COULD HELP SOME OF OUR PLAYERS, I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD EXPLORE.
Stephen:  YOU CAN'T HAVE MARIJUANA IN FOOTBALL. NO! THOSE PLAYERS WILL BE SO HIGH, THEY'LL FORGET TO TAKE THEIR PERCOCET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND FOLKS, FOLKS--   ( CHEERS ) NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL IS NOT HELPING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO DEVELOP AS FAR AS THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY IN MEDICINE TO EVOLVE, AND TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH PAIN OR TO HELP WITH INJURIES, BUT WE WILL TRY TO CONTINUALLY SUPPORT THE EVOLUTION OF MEDICINE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen:  THAT WAS A CLEAR ENDORSEMENT OF MARIJUANA. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  BECAUSE THAT STATEMENT-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT STATEMENT WAS SO RAMBLING, HE HAD TO BE HIGH. FOLKS, THIS IS REEFER MADNESS. AFTER HITTING THE PRESCRIPTION PIPE, PLAYERS WON'T WANT TO HIT THEIR OPPONENTS ANYMORE. THEY'LL JUST INCAPACITATE EACH OTHER WITH MIND-BLOWING SCIENCE FACTS. "DUDE, DUDE, DID YOU KNOW THAT ALL THE GOLD IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP RING WAS CREATED IN A SUPERNOVA BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FOLKS, POT IS NOT THE ONLY THREAT FOOTBALL FACES. SO IS THE SELFISH CONCERN SOME PEOPLE HAVE FOR THEIR FELLOW MAN'S SKULL MEAT. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST BECAUSE OF SOME CRACKPOT THEORY THAT HUGE MEN COLLIDING AT FULL SPEED MIGHT BE DANGEROUS.
THE GROWING AWARENESS OF HEAD INJURIES IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST CRISIS FACING THE NFL.
YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS SEPARATE FROM NFL DOCTOR THAT HAVE BEEN SAYING FEBRUARY YEARS THERE ARE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN REPETITIVE BRAIN TRAUMA, REPETITIVE TRAUMA FROM FOOTBALL AND THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING LONG-TERM BRAIN DAMAGE.
ACCORDING TO ESPN SPORTS SCIENCE, BIG BLOWS LIKE THIS CAN BE THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING A SLEDGEHAMMER TO THE HEAD.
Stephen:  OH, THEY WORRY ABOUT THE NFL, YET NOBODY IS PROTESTING THE NATIONAL SLEDGEHAMMER LEAGUE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) COME ON. LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG. DON'T GET ME WRONG, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST BRAINS. SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS HAVE THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU CANNOT SCRAP FOOTBALL OVER BRAIN DAMAGE. JUST ASK THE BRAIN DAMAGED.
THIS IS AN AMERICAN PASTIME. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY TIED IN FOR SO MANY YEARS WITH OUR TRADITION. IT'S SAD, BUT AT THE SAME TIME-- I MEAN, WE ALL LOVE TO WATCH IT.
FOR ME AND FOR MILLIONS OF OTHERS, WE GET TOO MUCH PLEASURE OUT OF WATCHING THIS.
IN THIS DAY AND AGE, PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR LIVES. THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO IS FOOTBALL.
Stephen:  YES, SOME PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE SO BLEAK, STUCK IN A SOUL-CRUSHING AND POINTLESS JOB, SURROUNDED BY COWORKERS WHO DON'T RESPECT THEM, THAT THE ONLY BRIGHT SPOT IS LAYING ON THE COUCH IN A NACHO-INDUCED COMA JUST PRAYING BY THE GRACE OF GOD THEY'LL CHOKE ON A CHICKEN WING AND END IT ALL. YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY. IT'S HIS ONLY HOPE. BESIDES-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BESIDES, IF WE CAN'T WATCH PEOPLE HURT THEMSELVES, IT WOULD CRIPPLE CABLE TELEVISION. NO MORE "HORDERS." NO MORE "DEADLIEST CATCH." NO MORE "ICE ROAD TRUCKERS," OR "MAN VS. FOOD." ALL WE'LL BE LEFT WITH IS Q.V.C.
1860 IS THE ITEM NUMBER ON THIS ONE. AND THE NICE THING ABOUT THESE-- OH! THAT HURT! ( LAUGHTER ) OH, THAT HURT BIG TIME. A PIECE OF THAT JUST-- THE TIP JUST GOT ME ODELL. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, THAT GOT ME GOOD.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
A PIECE OF THAT TIP JUST GOT ME.
WE MAY NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY IN THE STUDIO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  HE WILL BE MISSED. ( LAUGHTER ) THE POINT IS THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IN FOOTBALL. HERE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ARE THE AUTHORS OF "LEAGUE OF DENIAL," STEVE FAINARU, AND MARK FAINARU-WADA. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, YOU GUYS HAVE RUINED FOOTBALL. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING THE GAME ON SUNDAY?
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen:  OKAY, LET'S HEAR YOUR ARGUMENT. WHAT IS HAPPENING, DO YOU SAY, TO THE BRAINS OF THESE PLAYERS?
THE POINT OF THE BOOK WAS TO LAY OUT TWO DECADES' WORTH OF DENIAL BY THE LEAGUE. WHEN THEY WERE CONFRONTED WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT, YOU KNOW, FOOTBALL WAS POSSIBLY CAUSING BRAIN DAMAGE, THEY WOULD SAY IT'S NOT REALLY AN ISSUE. WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. THEY CREATED THEIR OWN COMMITTEE TO STUDY THIS ISSUE.
Stephen:  YES, THEY DID D.
THEY APPOINTED A RHEUMATOLOGIST TO HEAD THE COMMITTEE NOT A BRAIN PERSON.
Stephen:  WHAT'S WRONG WITH A RHEUMATOLOGIST? THE BRAIN IS NOTHING BUT A SKULL LIGAMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) RIGHT? HOLDS THE TWO SIDES OF THE SKULL TOGETHER, CONNECT THE TWO SIDES OF THE SKULL.
THERE YOU GO.
Stephen:  WHO SHOULD THEY HAVE BROUGHT IN?
WELL, AT THE TIME THERE WERE A NUMBER OF NEUROSCIENTISTS WHO WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET THE LEAGUE'S ATTENTION. SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY WORKED IN THE LEAGUE. THEY LOVED FOOTBALL. ONE OF THEM HAD WORKED FOR THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS. A NEUROPATHOLOGIST AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY WAS A HUGE FOOTBALL FAN. AND THEY WERE TRYING TO TELL THE NFL THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM. AND IN RESPONSE, THE NFL ATTACKED THOSE PEOPLE, TRIED TO DISCREDIT THEM.
Stephen:  THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE. THE NFL TOOK ACTION. THEY'VE CHANGED THE RULES. THEY'VE CREATED THIS FUND WITH $765 MILLION TO TAKE CARE OF THE PLAYERS' HEALTH NEEDS. WHY ARE YOU SAYING THEY ARE IN DENIAL? >>IT'S INTERESTING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE LEAGUE HAS DEALT WITH THIS OVER TIMES, THERE IS CERTAINLY A MOVE THEY'VE MADE, BUT WHEN THE COMMISSIONER IS ASKED, IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN FOOTBALL AND BRAIN DAMAGE, HE SAYS THE SAME THING HE SAID FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN HE GOT HAMMERED BEFORE CONGRESS, WE'LL LET THE MEDICAL PEOPLE DECIDE THAT. THE MEDICAL PEOPLE ALREADY DECIDED THAT.
YOU GET YOUR MEDICAL PEOPLE, I'LL GET MY MEDICAL PEOPLE.
THAT'S SORT OF WHAT THEY DID. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID.
Stephen:  OKAY, ISN'T THERE A POINT AT WHICH WE MAKE THINGS TOO SAFE? ALL SPORT ARE DANGEROUS ON A CERTAIN LEVEL, AREN'T WE? YOU DIDN'T SEE THE ANCIENT ROMANS WORRYING ABOUT THE BRAIN DAMAGE THE CHRISTIANS AND THE LIONS, OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) SO HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN ATTACKED BY NFL? HAVE YOU BEEN ATTACKED BY THE NFL? BECAUSE DOCTORS WERE ATTACKED. HAVE YOU PERSONALLY BEEN ATTACKED BY THE NFL?
WELL, THE NFL, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, HAS NOT BEEN COOPERATIVE WITH OUR RESEARCH. THEY-- THEY REALLY JUST REFUSED TO BE-- TO BE INTERVIEWED. THERE WAS A FRONTLINE DOCUMENTARY THAT WAS MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR BOOK. AT THE VERY END OF TOUR EMPLOYER, ESPN, PULLED OUT OF THE PARTNERSHIP OF THAT DOCUMENTARY, AND THEN IT WAS-- AND THEN NEWS CAME OUT THAT IT WAS AFTER MEETING WITH THE NFL, THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT THERE WAS PRESSURE APPLIED BY THE NFL TO PULL OUT OF OUT OF THE DOCUMENTARY. SO THE NFL HAS BEEN-- YOU KNOW, THEY'VE BEEN UNCOOPERATIVE, I WOULD SAY. IWE'RE PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW.
Stephen:  DO YOU EVER WISH YOU HAD TAKEN ON AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS LESS VINDICTIVE, LIKE MAYBE THE MAFIA OR TAYLOR SWIFT? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELL, STEVE, MARK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. STEVE FAINARU AND MARK FAINARU-WADA. THE BOOK IS "LEAGUE OF DENIAL." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
