Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. NATION, NATION, TUESDAY'S ELECTION LOSS WAS AN HISTORIC LOSS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I'D SAY THEY GOT THEIR ASSES HANDED TO THEM BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN HANDOUTS YOU HAVE TO EARN THAT ASS, DEMOCRATS. AND THANKS TO THE LOSS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING ANYMORE BECAUSE THE SENATE SURE WON'T.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE, CURRENTLY RUN, LIBERAL DEMOCRAT, GLOBAL WARMING BELIEVER, BARBARA BOXER, REPLACED PROBABLY BY JAMES INHOFE, CONSERVATIVE FROM OKLAHOMA WHO IS AS MUCH OF AN OPPONENT OR SKEPTIC ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING AS THERE IS.
Stephen: YES, THE GLOBAL WARMING BELIEVER IS OUT AND THE GLOBAL WARMING SKEPTIC IS IN, SO FINALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE CAN FOCUS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE WHO'S STEALING ALL OUR POLAR BEARS? AND SENATOR JAMES INHOFE IS NOT YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL CLIMATE CHANGE DENIER. YOU COULD SAY HE WROTE THE BOOK ON IT BECAUSE HE WROTE THE BOOK ON IT. "THE GREATEST HOAX: HOW THE GLOBAL WARMING CONSPIRACY THREATENS YOUR FUTURE."
Audience: BOO.
Stephen: OOH, YEAH. IT IS EXCITING. IT'S LIKE HARRY POTTER FOR PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT HARRY POTTER HAD TOO MUCH SCIENCE IN IT. OF COURSE, NOT ALL REPUBLICANS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ARE AS BOLD AS INHOFE. IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING SO-CALLED EVIDENCE AND ACTUALLY CALLED EVIDENCE, THEY DEPLOYED A BRILLIANT TACTIC DURING THIS LAST CAMPAIGN. CASE IN POINT-- NEWLY ELECTED TEXAS LAND COMMISSIONER GEORGE P. BUSH-- NEPHEW OF GEORGE W. BUSH, GRANDSON OF GEORGE H.W. BUSH, AND FUTURE FATHER OF GEORGE UNDERSCORE BUSH-- LISTEN TO GEORGE P., OR P.-BIDDY, SPIT SOME NOT-KNOWLEGE
HOW BIG A THREAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE TEXAS COASTLINE?
THE TEXAS COASTLINE IS IMPACTED BY RISING SEA LEVELS. AND, AGAIN, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S MANMADE, AND I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE SCIENTISTS.
BUT YOU DON'T DOUBT HUMAN ACTIVITY CONTRIBUTES TO CLIMATE CHANGE?
WE'LL SEE IN TERMS OF THE SCIENCE, IN TERMS-- THERE'S A WIDE RANGE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. AGAIN, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST BY EVERY STRETCH, BUT EVERYWHERE FROM NO IMPACT AT ALL TO 100%.
Stephen: YEAH, HE'S NO SCIENTIST. HE'S NO SCIENTIST. IN FACT, I'M IMPRESSED HE WAS ABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO FROM 0 TO 100%. HOW IMPRESSED AM I? SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 0 AND 100%. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, FOLKS, GEORGE P. NOT ALONE.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST NOR AM I A PHYSICIST.
I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO DEBATE THE SCIENCE OVER CLIMATE CHANGE.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
WHAT I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY IS I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
Stephen: YES, EVERYONE WHO DENIES MANMADE CLIMATE CHANGE HAS THE SAME STIRRING MESSAGE-- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND I HOPE, I HOPE, I HOPE THAT THESE CONSERVATIVE LEADERS CAN INSPIRE ALL THE CHILDREN OUT THERE WATCHING TO THINK TO THEMSELVES, HEY, MAYBE SOME DAY I COULD GROW UP TO BE NOT A SCIENTIST. WELL, KIDS, NOW THERE'S A FUN WAY TO EXPLORE YOUR OWN LACK OF CURIOSITY AT HOME. IT'S TIME FOR MY EDUCATIONAL SERIES "PROFESSOR NOT A SCIENTIST." ALL YOU NEED IS A GLASS CASSEROLE DISH, OKAY. THEN ONE OF YOUR MOM'S PITCHERS FILLED WITH BLUE WATER. AND GET A DETAILED TOPOGRAPHICAL MODEL OF AMERICA. DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK YOUR PARENTS FOR HELP HIRING A PROPS DEPARTMENT TO MAKE THIS ONE FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT, LET'S BEGIN. THERE YOU GO. UH-OH! NOW WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAPPENING IS THAT THE WATER IS RISING. WHY? ONE THEORY IS I DON'T KNOW, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. OH, LOOK, THERE GOES FLORIDA. AND THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING WHY. REMEMBER, KIDS, IF YOU GET UNHOOKED ON SCIENCE EARLY, MAYBE SOME DAY, YOU COULD COMPLETELY LACK ANY UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE AND THEN GROW UP TO BE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
