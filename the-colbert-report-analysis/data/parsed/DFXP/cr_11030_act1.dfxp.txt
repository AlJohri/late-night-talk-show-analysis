Stephen: TONIGHT, IS AMERICA CRUEL TO CONVICTS? WELL, VERTICAL STRIPES WOULD BE MORE SLIMMING. (LAUGHTER) THEN A POPULAR RESTAURANT SPREADS CHRISTMAS CHEER. THIS YEAR McRIBS ARE REINDEER MEAT. (LAUGHTER) AND MY GUESTS TONY BENNETT AND LADY GAGA ARE HERE WITH A NEW ALBUM OF DUETS. OOH! I WONDER WHO THEY DUET WITH? (LAUGHTER)    A MAJOR LEAGUE UMPIRE HAS REVEALED THAT HE IS GAY. OR AS HE PUT IT -- "I'M OUT!" (LAUGHTER) THIS IS "THE COLBERT REPORT." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ♪♪ (EAGLE CAW) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT EVERYBODY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WHAT ENERGY! WHAT JOY! (AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN") YOU HEAR THAT? THAT IS THE SOUND OF JUSTICE ON THE MARCH. THAT'S THE SOUND OF HEROS ON THE MOVE! THAT IS THE SOUND OF PEOPLE GETTING IT AS IT-GETTERS FOLKS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE! (CHEERING) YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE BUT FOLKS, LONG-TIME VIEWERS OF MY SHOW KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOW SHORT-TIME VIEWERS BECAUSE, AS OF TONIGHT, THERE ARE ONLY 11 EPISODES OF "THE COLBERT REPORT" LEFT. (AUDIENCE AWWWS) ALL YOUR AWWWWING IS WASTING PRECIOUS COLBERT TALK TIME. BUT THANK YOU. NOW, A LESSER NEWSMAN MIGHT STOOP TO SOME CHEAP PUBLICITY STUNT BEFORE THEY GO OFF THE AIR. WE ALL REMEMBER WHEN WALTER CRONKITE ENDED HIS REIGN AT "CBS EVENING NEWS" BY LEG-WRESTLING MR. T. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT KIND OF SHAMEFUL LAST-DITCH RATINGS GRAB. I'M TOO BUSY PLANNING THIS COMING MONDAY'S SHOW, WHEN I WILL BE BROADCASTING "THE COLBERT REPORT" FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH! IT'S MY FAREWELL TO WASHINGTON SPECIAL. STEPHEN COLBERT PRESENTS MR. COLBERT GOES TO WASHINGTON, D.C., SEE YA LATER LEGISLATOR PARTISAN IS SUCH SWEET SORROW! A COLBERT VICTORY LAP '014! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! NATION, THIS IS GOING TO BE HUGE-LY DEVASTATING TO WHAT LITTLE OF MY BUDGET REMAINS BECAUSE WITH ONLY 11 SHOWS LEFT, THE NETWORK'S NOT CUTTIN' THE BIG CHECKS FOR MY PET PROJECTS. SO TO RIDE THE TRAIN DOWN THERE FOR FREE, I'M GETTING MYSELF CERTIFIED AS A SERVICE ANIMAL. IF YOU SEE ME, PLEASE DO NOT PET ME. I'M WORKING. TUNE IN ON MONDAY TO SEE ME AT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY'S LISNER AUDITORIUM. BE A PART OF THE MILLION ME MARCH WHEN I FINALLY PROVIDE THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT A PROPER PAIR OF BALLS. (LAUGHTER) NATION, A LOT OF PEOPLE -- IT'S GONNA BE BIG -- A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND US. WE DON'T MAKE ANYTHING ANYMORE. OUR CARS ARE MADE IN JAPAN, OUR COMPUTERS ARE MADE IN CHINA, EVEN OUR SEXIEST MEN ARE MADE IN AUSTRALIA. BUT THERE'S STILL ONE THING AMERICA PRODUCES MORE OF THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD -- PRISONERS. WE'RE NUMBER ONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SIR AMERICA HAS 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE BEHIND BARS. WE BEAT EVERYONE! IN YOUR FACE, CHINA! THOUGH I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PRODUCING THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC HANDCUFFS. COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. AND WHEN IT COMES TO MASS INCARCERATION AMERICA-STYLE, NOBODY DOES IT LIKE CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE MID '70s, ITS PRISON POPULATION HAS GROWN BY 750%, DRIVEN BY THE STATE'S TOUGH THREE-STRIKES LAW, WHICH MANDATED 25 YEARS TO LIFE FOR ANYONE CONVICTED OF THREE FELONIES -- EVEN FOR NON-VIOLENT OFFENSES LIKE DRUG POSSESSION OR ATTEMPTING TO STEAL A PAIR OF WORK GLOVES FROM HOME DEPOT. SURE, IT SEEMS PETTY, BUT IT STARTS WITH GLOVES, NEXT HE'S PICKING UP A CHAINSAW, A SHED TO HIDE THE BODY, AND WALL SCONCES TO GIVE THE MURDER SCENE SOME ACCENT LIGHTING! BUT A CALIFORNIA'S MODEL PRISON SYSTEM COULD SOON BE ON DEATH ROW, AND THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S WORD. (CHEERING) CROOK AND LADDER. NATION, CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS ARE UNDER ATTACK BY ACTIVIST JUDGES. IN 2011, THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA'S OVERCROWDED PRISONS ARE SO BAD THAT THEY VIOLATE THE BAN ON CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. OH, BIG WHOOP. ALL OUR PRISONS ARE OVERCROWDED -- THE PHANTOM ZONE, ARKHAM, AZKABAN. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED -- THE COURT ORDERED CALIFORNIA TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT PRISON OVERCROWDING, BUT SO FAR THE STATE'S RESPONSE IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. OF COURSE, THEY COULD SOLVE THE WHOLE THING IF THEY JUST STORED INMATES IN THOSE ZIPLOC SPACE BAGS. SO WHILE THE STATE GOVERNMENT WRESTLED WITH THE PROBLEM, LAST MONTH CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION 47, WHICH REDUCES PENALTIES FOR OFFENDERS WHO COMMIT NON-SERIOUS AND NON-VIOLENT CRIMES, POTENTIALLY RELEASING 10,000 FELONS FROM STATE PRISON. THAT'S RIGHT. 10,000 NON-VIOLENT FELONS BACK ON THE STREETS. GOVERNOR BROWN IS GONNA HAVE TO DEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HOME DEPOT'S GLOVE AISLE. (LAUGHTER) FOLKS, I SAY WE MUST KEEP THESE DANGER-ISH CRIMINALS BEHIND BARS. AND NOT JUST TO PUNISH THEM.
FOR DECADES, CALIFORNIA HAS USED INMATES TO FIGHT FIRES AND CLEAR LAND TO STOP THE SPREAD OF WILDFIRES. PHYSICALLY FIT INMATES WITH NO HISTORY OF VIOLENT CRIMES CAN WORK AS FIREFIGHTERS WHILE SERVING THEIR SENTENCE.
THE RECENTLY-PASSED INITIATIVE COULD FREE SUCH PRISONERS FROM JAIL AND DEPLETE THE POOL OF INMATES WHO QUALIFY FOR FIRE DUTY.
Stephen: THAT MEANS THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A FIRE, YOU COULD BE STUCK IN YOUR HOME AND THERE WON'T BE A CONVICTED FELON RUSHING TOWARDS YOU WITH AN AXE. (LAUGHTER) CALIFORNIA NEEDS THESE PRISONERS. SO WHEN FEDERAL JUDGES ORDERED THEIR RELEASE, THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOUGHT TO KEEP THE PRISONERS WORKING IN THEIR FIRE BRIGADE. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE LIVES THESE PRISONERS SAVE, IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT -- ALL THE MONEY. BECAUSE CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS SAY THE FIRE PROGRAM SAVES THE STATE MORE THAN $100 MILLION A YEAR. BECAUSE INMATES EARN JUST $2 A DAY FIGHTING FIRES. WITH PAY LIKE THAT, IT'S NO WONDER SMOKEY THE BEAR CAN'T AFFORD A SHIRT. THE SAVINGS ARE VITAL BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BURNED THROUGH THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE-FIGHTING  BUDGET OF $209 MILLION. CALIFORNIA HASN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF CASH GO UP IN SMOKE SINCE THE LAST TIME SOMEONE LET M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN MAKE A MOVIE. NATION, I FOR ONE SALUTE CALIFORNIA PRISON AUTHORITIES FOR NOT RELEASING NON-VIOLENT PRISONERS FROM CRUEL AND UNUSUAL CONDITIONS. AFTER YEARS OF CORPORATIONS OUTSOURCING AMERICAN JOBS, THEY'VE FOUND A WAY TO BRING THIRD-WORLD WAGES BACK HOME. IT'S LIKE HAVING OUR OWN PRIVATE BANGLADESH! THESE ARE THE BEST WORKERS ALMOST NO MONEY CAN BUY. THEY CAN'T QUIT. THEY NEVER GO HOME. AND THE ONLY UNION THEY'RE ALLOWED TO JOIN IS THE ARYAN BROTHERHOOD. AND IF WE LEGALLY MUST REDUCE OVERCROWDING, WE SHOULDN'T DO IT BY RELEASING THESE MODEL EMPLOYEES. WE SHOULD JUST BUILD NEW PRISONS. WE CAN DO IT CHEAP FOR TOO, BECAUSE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE  THAT WORK FOR $2 A DAY! POINT IS, EVEN THOUGH THESE PEOPLE ARE JAILED IN CRUEL AND UNUSUAL CONDITIONS FOR NON-VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE DRUG POSSESSION, CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO KEEP THEM. NOT THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOOKED ON PRISON LABOR. IT CAN STOP ANYTIME IT WANTS. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
