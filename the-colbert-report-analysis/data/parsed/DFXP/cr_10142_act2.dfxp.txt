Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID AND I NEEDED A QUESTION ANSWERED I ALWAYS USED TO TURN TO MY FAVORITE FAMILY MEMBER, TV. (LAUGHTER) IT ANSWERED ALL THE BIG QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHO'S THE BOSS AND HOWDY DOODY! AND NOW I'D LIKE TO USE TV TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN MY WEEKLY VIEWER MAIL SEGMENT THAT I DO TWICE A YEAR. IT'S TIME TO CHECK THE INBOX. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S TODAY'S VIEWER LETTER. WHERE WE GO -- HERE YOU ARE. DEAR STEPHEN, WHICH IS THE SUPERIOR SANDWICH THE B.L.T. OR THE CLUB. PLEASE SETTLE THIS, I'VE GOT A LOT OF MONEY RIDING ON IT, SINCERELY POPE FRANCIS, THE VATICAN. OKAY, YOUR HOLINESS, NOW I'VE AVOIDED THIS FOR YEARS BECAUSE B.L.T. VERSUS CLUB IS THE THIRD-RAIL OF SANDWICH POLITICS. A CONFLICT THAT DATES BACK CENTURIES, LIKE ISRAEL AND PALESTINE -- IF JEWS AND MUSLIMS COULD EAT EITHER SANDWICH. BUT OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T IGNORE THE CONTROVERSY ANY LONGER,  SO LET'S SINK OUR TEETH INTO THIS ONE. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU HAVE THE AMERICAN CLASSIC, THE B.L.T. IT'S AN HONEST SANDWICH THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW RIGHT UP FRONT. IT'S GOT BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'VE GOT THE CLUB. WHAT DOES THAT ACRONYM EVEN STAND FOR? CHICKEN, LETTUCE, UNDERWEAR AND BALLOONS? THAT'S DISGUSTING! SOUNDS LIKE THE DUMPSTER OUTSIDE PARTY CITY. PLUS THE B.L.T. IS INSPIRED BY GOD. THE BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO REPRESENT THE HOLY TRINITY. THE LETTUCE OF COURSE, THE LETTUCE OF COURSE IS THE HOLY GHOST BECAUSE NOBODY IS SURE WHY IT'S THERE. (LAUGHTER) MEAN WHILE, THE CLUB ALSO HAS BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO BUT IT RUINS THE PERFECT LINEUP BY ADDING TURKEY. THAT'S LIKE WHEN CROSBY, STILLS AND NASH RUINED THEIR LINEUP BY ADDING A TURKEY! (CHEERING) HE, OF COURSE, IS LATER REPLACED BY NEIL YOUNG WHO DID NOT HAVE  THE TURKEY'S VOCAL RANGE. MEANWHILE THE B.L.T. IS A WARM, INVITING SANDWICH, WELCOMING TO AL. BUT THE CLUB SANDWICH IS SO EXCLUSIVE. OH, WHAT'S THAT? YOU WON'T LET ME INTO YOUR SANDWICH CLUB BECAUSE I'M NOT WEARING MY TENNIS WHITES AND MY LAST NAME DOESN'T END IN III? YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NERVE SANDWICH -- WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO ONE OF YOUR INGREDIENTS. NOT TO MENTION THE B.L.T. CAN STAND ON ITS OWN, WHEREAS THE CLUB HAS NO STRUCTURE INTEGRITY AND MUST TO BE PROPPED UP BY A  DECORATIVE TOOTH PICK -- OR AS THE CHILDREN CALL IT, MOMMY, THE   SANDWICH SHIVED ME IN THE MOUTH. BUT HERE'S THE REAL CLINCHER, FOLKS, HERE'S THE REAL CLINCHER. WHILE THE B.L.T. IS NESTLED  BETWEEN TWO LIGHTLY TOASTED BREAD SLICES, THE CLUB HAS THE AUDACITY TO ADD AN EXTRA LAYER OF TOAST. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A FREAKY BREAD THREE-WAY, A MINAGE-A TOAST. OH BECAUSE EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYING WHAT? OH THIS SANDWICH IS SO GOOD, I JUST WISH IT HAD MORE BREAD? AND HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO TOAST THREE PIECES OF TOAST? OH, I KNOW, I'LL USE MY THREE-SLICE TOASTER! (BLEEP) YOU! I'M SORRY, FOLKS! NO, NO, NO! IT'S NOT EVEN A CONTEST, THE CLUB SNADWICH  WILL DO IF YOU HAVE FALLEN DOWN A CRAVASS AND CAN'T EAT YOUR ARM. THE CLEAR WINNER IS THE B.L.T., IT'S AN AMERICAN HERO. IT'S AN AMERICAN HERO THAT IS WAY BETTER THAN AN AMERICAN HERO. WELL I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IL PAPA. HOW ABOUT THOSE INDULGENCES I ASKED FOR, NOW, OKAY? THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BUILT THE RETIREMENT HOME SO CLOSE TO WHERE MY CAR WAS DRIVING. JIM, LET'S CLOSE THE INBOX. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
