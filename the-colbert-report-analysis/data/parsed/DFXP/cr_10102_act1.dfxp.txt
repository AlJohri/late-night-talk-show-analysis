(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE REPORT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOLKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FOLKS, IN HERE, OUT THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, NATION, IF YOU ARE WATCHING THE NEWS YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 2014 MIDTERM PRIMARIES. WHERE CANDIDATES ARE FIGHTING FOR VOTERS' APPROVAL SO THEY CAN GO TO CONGRESS AND LOSE IT IMMEDIATELY. (LAUGHTER) THE FIRST PRIMARY ELECTIONS WERE THIS LAST TUESDAY AND AN OHIO-INDIANA AND NORTH CAROLINA TEA PARTY CANDIDATES LOST TO ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS. FOLKS, IT LOOKS LIKE THE COUNTRY CLUB REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO RUN EVERYTHING. THEY CERTAINLY DO IN MY COUNTRY CLUB. (LAUGHTER) REALLY NICE. BUT THERE'S ONE PRIMARY THE TEA PARTY CANNOT LOSE. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES IN IT. FLORIDA'S THIRD DISTRICT. THE FIGHTIN THIRD. IT PITS REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT AND OFF BRAND CHOCOLATE DRINK TED YOHO AGAINST FELLOW REPUBLICAN JAKE RUSH WHO IS RUNNING ON A PLATFORM OF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, STRICT CONSTITUTIONALISM, STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE AND REPEAL OBAMACARE. JAKE RUSH IS EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A CONGRESSMAN AND MAYBE MORE THAN YOU DO.
JAKE RUSH RUNNING FOR THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.
SELLING HIMSELF AS A CONSERVATIVE STRAIGHT SHOOTER, BUT GUESS WHAT, HE HAPPENS TO BE A VAMPIRE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. WITH A NAME LIKE JAKE RUSH, YOU WOULD THINK SOFT-CORE PORN BUT AS A VAMPIRE HE GOES UNDER THE NAME CHAZZ DARLING. SEEN HERE AS A MALEVOLENT LORD OF THE UNDEAD WHO HAS JUST HAD HIS EYES DILATED BY AN INCOMPETENT OPHTHALMOLOGIST. JAKE RUSH IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN LIVE ACTION ROLE PLAYING OR LARP. LARP IS ALSO THE SOUND HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGER MADE WHEN HE SAW THIS PICTURE. AND CHAZZ DARLING'S JUST ONE OF THE CHARACTERS JAKE RUSH PLAYS. OTHERS INCLUDE LORD STAAS VAN DER WINST AND ARCHBISHOP KETERING WHO WAS BORN IN 1146, MAKING HIM YOUNGER THAN MANY FLORIDA VOTERS. (LAUGHTER) AND JAKE RUSH WAS ONCE AN ACTUAL ALA'CHUA COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTY WHERE HIS ROLE PLAYING EXPERIENCES WERE CONSIDERED AN ADVANTAGE WHEN APPLYING FOR UNDERCOVER WORK. BAD NEWS, CRIMINALS, HE'S NOT ACTUALLY A DRUG DEALER, HE'S CHAZZ DARLING, VAMPIRE COP. (APPLAUSE) SO-- SO WHO WILL BE FLORIDA'S NEXT TEA PARTY CONGRESSMAN, TO FIND OUT I SAT DOWN WITH JAKE RUSH IN TONIGHT'S BETTER KNOW A CHALLENGER.
GOOD EVENING. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME HERE SO CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THE WITCHING HOUR. ARE WE NOT-- WHY AREN'T YOU IN CHARACTER.
UH--
Stephen: I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO ROLE PLAY.
NO, STEPHEN.
Stephen: NO? WELL, I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT. I'M SORRY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HI, SORRY ABOUT THAT. I JUST-- I'M SORRY. ANYWAY, JAKE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, STEPHEN.
Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE FIGHTING THIRD.
THIRD DISTRICT OF FLORIDA IS NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA THAT GOES FROM NORTHWEST OCALAA TO THE GEORGIA BORDER AND EAST TO JACKSONVILLE.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU WANT TO RUN FOR CONGRESS?
WELL, STEPHEN, I'M TIRED OF ALL THE HYPOCRISY IN D.C. AND FED UP WITH BEING EMBARRASSED WITH MY CONGRESS PHENOMENON.
Stephen: SIR, FOR THE RECORD, ARE YOU A VAMPIRE.
NO.
Stephen: JUST MAKING SURE, MAKING SURE. ALL RIGHT, YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN RUNNING AGAINST INCUMBENT TEA PARTY CANDIDATE TED --
YOHO.
Stephen: NOW TED YOHO HAS HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT YOU. LET'S GO THROUGH THE LIST. HE SAID DISTURBING AND THAT'S ACTUALLY ALL HE SAID. (LAUGHTER)
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT TED YOHO SAYS THAT HE REPRESENTS OUR TEA PARTY BUT IS MAKING FUN OF A GUY IN COSTUME. OR HE SAYS THAT HE REPRESENTS OUR LIBERTARIANS BUT THEN POSTS OLD GAMING PICTURES OF ME.
Stephen: TED YOHO HAS SERVED TWO YEARS. IS THAT ENOUGH EXPERIENCE TO CONDEMN HIM AS A WASHINGTON INSIDER.
ENOUGH TO CONDEMN HIM ABOUT HIS VOTING RECORD.
Stephen: HE VOWED TO OPPOSE ANY MILITARY ACTION AGAINST ANY COUNTRY THAT IS NOT A DIRECT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES.
ISN'T THAT RIDICULOUS.
Stephen: IT IS RIDICULOUS. HOW IS IT RIDICULOUS.
IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT WE DON'T PROJECT MILITARY POWER. WE HAVE THE LARGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
Stephen: WHAT COUNTRY WITH YOU HAVE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THAT IS NOT A DIRECT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES?
WELL, FOR INSTANCE, THE BATTLE IN SYRIA.
Stephen: FORGOT ABOUT SYRIA.
THERE IS AN ADAGE IN MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO HAVE TO TAKE THE SAME GROUND TWICE, IT'S COSTLY.
Stephen: LIKE GOING INTO WAR IN IRAQ TWICE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHICH ONE OF THOSE SHOULD WE NOT HAVE DONE.
WELL, STEVE EM, THE PROBLEM WITH-- I DON'T KNOW, WARS ARE COMPLICATED.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, GOOD TO KNOW. HERE'S THE THING. I HAD TO GRILL YOU ABOUT THAT TED YOHO STUFF BECAUSE I HAD TO FIND OUT WHERE YOUR BONA FIDES LAY.
FAIR.
Stephen: FACT IS, YOU ARE WHAT THE PARTY NEEDS. YOU ARE A STANCH CONSERVATIVE, A FREE MARKET CAPITALIST, SMALL GOVERNMENT, WALK SOFTLY AND CARRY A BIG STICK KIND OF GUY, RIGHT.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR CORE MESSAGE AS A SMALL GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE WHO ALSO PRETENDS TO BE A VAMPIRE. WHAT IS THE CORE MESSAGE. IF I LOOK AT THAT WHOLE PACKAGE WHAT IS THE CORE MESSAGE?
PRIVACY RIGHTS, PERSONAL FREEDOM.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU GO BY THE ALTER EGO CHAZZ DARLING, STAAS VAN WINST, AND ARCHBISHOP KETERING. WHO AM I SPEAKING TO RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO JAKE RUSH.
Stephen: THAT SAY GREAT CHARACTER NAME.
THAT IS MY REAL NAME.
Stephen: JAKE RUSH, WOKE EARLY ONE MORNING, HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY THERE WAS BLOOD ON HIS SHOES. ALL HE KNEW WAS THERE WAS A DEAD WOMAN IN BED WITH HIM. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, JAKE RUSH.
HOPEFULLY HE GETS OUT TO VOTE, GETS PEOPLE MOTIVATED TO COME OUT.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE DEAD WOMAN.
CALL THE POLICE.
Stephen: YOU DEFENDED YOUR HISTORY OF ROLE PLAYING.
YEAH.
Stephen: BY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE LONG BEEN A THESPIAN. HOW HAS THAT BEEN FOR YOU AS A REPUBLICAN TO BE AN OPEN THESPIAN.
THE ARTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR CULTURE.
Stephen: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THESPIANS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET MARRIED.
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM FLAUNTING THEIR LIFESTYLE, IT'S FINE WHAT THEY DO IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN BEDROOM, OR AS THEY CALL IT SCISSORING. I DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT THESPIANS DO FOR THEIR KICKS.
THESPIAN MEANS ACTOR, STEPHEN.
Stephen: OH, HE IS RIGHT? IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS? ALL RIGHT, I KNEW THAT, I KNEW THAT.
STEPHEN, AS I SAID, THEY'RE ROLES LIKE AN ACTOR'S ROLE.
Stephen: WHY DID YOU KILL THAT WOMAN?
WHAT?
Stephen: THE WOMAN IN BED WITH YOU IN THE JAKE RUSH NOVEL. WHY DID YOU KILL HER. BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FILL OUT THE STORY. WHY DID YOU KILL HER.
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE YOUR STORY, I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WERE YOU BLACKED OUT.
NO, IT'S YOUR STORY.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD. SO I CAN GIVE ANY REASON I WANT.
YOU CAN. THAT'S FIRST AMENDMENT.
Stephen: FIRST AMENDMENT, OKAY, BECAUSE SHE LAUGHED WHEN YOU GOT NAKED. (LAUGHTER) LET'S SWITCH GEARS, ONE OF YOUR GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS THAT YOU SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED THE FIRST STAND YOUR GROUND CASE IN CENTRAL NORTH FLORIDA.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: WHY SHOULD BIG GOVERNMENT TELL ME WHERE I CAN OR CANNOT SHOOT MY GUN.
BIG GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT.
YES, SIR.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR GUN'S NAME?
WELL, I HAVE A GLOCK.
Stephen: WHAT IS ITS NAME, IS IT A SECRET.
NO, NO THERE IS NO-- THERE IS A MODEL NAME.
Stephen: I THOUGHT YOU LOVED GUNS.
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH GUNS.
Stephen: THAT IS VERY TOLERANT OF YOU, YOU TOLERATE GUNS, WOULDN'T WANT ONE DATING YOUR DAUGHTER IS WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
Stephen: SIMPLE QUESTION SIR, YES OR NO, WOULD YOU LET A GUN DATE YOUR DAUGHTER OR ARE YOU A RACIST.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
Stephen: YEAH, IN THIS DAY AND AGE, I AGREE. I THOUGHT WE HAD COME FURTHER THAN THAT. THIS IS MY GUN "SWEETNESS," OKAY. (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS THAT, WHAT IS THAT HONEY? SHH, NO, HE DIDN'T MEAN THE THINGS HE SAID.
YOU NEED TO KEEP THAT POINTED IN A SAFE DIRECTION SIR, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK TO MY GUN THAT WAY. WHAT'S THAT? NO, NO, THAT WOULD BE WRONG, NO, HE'S A GUEST. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE MADE HER MAD. NOW I'M GOING TO UP ALL NIGHT WITH HER CRYING.
FIRST RULE OF GUN SAFETY KEEP IT POINTED IF A SAFE DIRECTION.
Stephen: SHE WOULD NEVER HURT ME. SHE GETS ANGRY AND YES, DID SHE SAY A FEW THINGS THAT I FOUND THREATENING JUST THEN, YES.
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT GUN JOKES.
Stephen: I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT GUNS. (LAUGHTER) ALSO NOTHING SAD ABOUT THEM.
THEY'RE A TOOL.
Stephen: EXACTLY. LIKE MANY PEOPLE ARE.
TRUE.
Stephen: JAKE RUSH, THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME TODAY. AND CHAZZ DARLING, THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF ETERNITY TO BE WITH ME ON THE MORTAL PLANE.
THAT'S WEIRD.
Stephen: YEAH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
