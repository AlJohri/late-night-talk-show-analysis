HEY, WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A "NEW  YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE WRITER  WITH A NEW BOOK CALL WAD DO WOMEN WANT? IS THAT MEL GIBSON MOVIE WAS  RIGHT IT'S DRUNKEN  ANTI-SEMITES. PLEASE WELCOME DANIEL  BERGNER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT'S UP, MR. BERGNER, GOOD  TO SEE YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET UP FOR  ME. YOU ARE AUTHOR AND  CONTRIBUTING WRITER FOR "THE  NEW YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE AND  YOU GOT A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED, WHAT DO WOMEN WANT,  ADVENTURES IN THE SCIENCE OF  FEMALE DESIRE. FIRST OF ALL, OKAY, FIRST OF  ALL, WHAT DOES SCIENCE OR  SCIENTISTS KNOW ABOUT FEMALE DESIRE, ALL RIGHT? IT'S ALL MYSTERIOUS. IT'S ALL INTUITION. IT'S ALL SHROUDED IN MYSTERY  AND FLOWERS AND PERFUME,  RIGHT? IT'S UNDELL OFABLE.
SCIENCE IS TRYING NOW TO  PULL BACK THAT SOCIETAL VEIL,  PULL BACK ALL THAT UNDELL OF ABILITY AND GET AT SOME  TRUTH. AND SO HERE'S ONE. WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,  MONOGAMY MAY BE MUCH MORE OF  A PROBLEM FOR WOMEN THAN FOR  MEN.
Stephen: WHAT YOU TALKING  ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE'VE LONG BEEN TAUGHT AS  YOU KNOW MEN PROGRAMMED BY  EVOLUTION TO BE PROMISCUOUS.
Stephen: YES, EXACTLY,  SPREADING THEIR SEED AS  WIDELY AS POSSIBLE.
AN WOMEN TO BE MORE  GEARED TOWARD ONE GOOD MAN.
Stephen: WOMEN ARE BETTER  THAN MEN ARE. SEE? SEE. I JUST GOT A VALIDATION.
WHAT ABOUT THAT THEORY  WHERE WOMEN ARE BETTER  SUITED TO MONOGAMY IS TOO CONVENIENT AND COMFORTING  FOR MEN. I THINK SCIENCE-- .
Stephen: WHAT?
BECAUSE WE GET TO SIT  BACK, WE GET TO LET OUR EYES  AND THOUGHTS ROAM A BIT AND BE COMFORTABLE THAT OUR  WOMEN ARE REALLY OKAY ABOUT  THIS MONOGAMOUS SITUATION. SCIENCE IS TELLING US  SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT.
Stephen: BUDDY, BUDDY,  WOULD YOU LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE?
THAT'S SCIENCE.
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND  NO DOUBT IF I HAVE THE  COLBERT-- BUT HERE'S WHAT THE REST OF US ARE DEALING  WITH. SO MEREDITH SHIVERS,  FASCINATING SCIENTISTS  COMPARE WAG WOMEN SAY TURNS  THEM ON VERSUS-- VERSUS WHAT THEIR BODIES WITH A LITTLE  DEVICE-- ABISMOGRAPH.
Stephen: WHAT DOES IT DO.
IT IS A LIGHT SENSE THEIR  GOES INTO THE NETHER REGIONS,  WE SAY.
Stephen: WHERE THE LIGHT  OF SCIENCE DON'T SHINE.
IT MEASURES, HERE IS WHAT  SHE FOUND. ONE AMONG MEN EXAMPLES. SO VERY HANDSOME STRANGER  VERSUS VERY HANDSOME AND OF  COURSE TRUSTED CLOSE FRIEND. WOMEN SAY TRUSTED CLOSE  FRIEND TURNS THEM ON MORE. WOMEN'S BODIES SAY SOMETHING  VERY, VERY DIFFERENT. EXCEPT, OF COURSE WHEN  STEPHEN COLBERT IS THE  TRUSTED FRIEND.
Stephen: YES.
HERE IS ANOTHER FUNNY  EXAMPLE.
Stephen: SO FAR THIS  ISN'T FUNNY TO ME. IT'S VERY UPSETTING.
IT'S WORRISOME.
Stephen: ARE YOU JUST  LYING TO UP SET ME? OR MAYBE YOU JUST WROTE THIS  BOOK TO GET OVER A BAD  BREAKUP.
I HAVE BEEN-- .
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS  BASED ON, REAL SCIENCE.
INCREASING WORRY BUT  THAT'S MY OWN PERSONAL ISSUE  AS A MAN BUT LET ME JUST GET BACK TO ONE-- SO MOSTLY  WOMEN IN THIS BOOK BUT ONE  DETOUR TOWARD MONKEYS, ARE  CLOSE ANCESTORS LONG THOUGHT BY SCIENTISTS THAT MALE  MONKEYS, THE AGGRESSORS AND  ALWAYS PARTICULARLY  SEXUALLY, YOU TAKE AGAIN THE BLINDERS OFF, THE  ASSUMPTIONS PUSHED ASIDE,  WHICH SCIENCE IS SHOWING US  IS NO, ACTUALLY IT'S THE FEMALE MONKEYS WHO ARE THE  INITIATORS. THE FEMALE MONKEYS WHO ARE  DOING THE OBJECTIFYING OF  THEIR OBJECTS OF DESIRE.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND,  THEY TAUGHT MONKEYS ABOUT  MONEY, BASICALLY. THEY GAVE THEM LIKE PILLS  THAT WERE WORTH FOOD AND  BONOBO TURNED IT IMMEDIATELY INTO A PROSTITUTION ECONOMY  BUT IT WAS-- THEY DID. BUT IT WAS THE MALE MONKEYS  GIVING IT TO THE FEMALE  MONKEYS T WASN'T THE FEMALE MONKEYS GOING I WILL GIVE  AWAY MY FOOD FOR SEX. THE MALE MONKEYS WERE GIVING  AWAY THE FOOD FOR SEX.
AND AGAIN, SO COMFORTING  TO THINK THAT BUT I-- .
Stephen: I DON'T BUY THAT  COMFORTING.
ONE FEMALE CHARACTER IN  MY BOOK, THE FEMALE MONKEY  ACTUALLY THIS IS HER MAIN GESTURE IN LIFE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT  MEANS SERVE ME NOW. SO THE MALE MONKEY.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, AND THE  PRIMATOLOGIST I SPENT TIME  WITH, EVERY THREE YEARS HE  HAS TO SWITCH OUT THE MALE  MONKEYS.
Stephen: BECAUSE THEY ARE  EXHAUSTED.
THE FEMALE MONKEYS ARE  TOO BORED TO HAVE SEX WITH  THEM ANY MORE, THEY NEED A NEW BATCH.
Stephen: OH, OH.
YEAH, EXACTLY. OVER AND OVER WHAT WE ARE  SEEING DESPITE WHAT SORT OF  EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY HAS TAUGHT US ABOUT THOSE MEN  BEING PROMISCUOUS, WOMEN NOT,  IS WOMEN ARE EQUALLY  INTERESTED. YOU STIP A-- STRIP AWAY THE  DANGER AND STIGMA IN CASUAL  SEX, AND OVER AND OVER YOU SEE THESE EXAMPLES OF KIND  OF RAW OR RAWER PORTRAIT OF  FEMALE SEXUALITY THEN WE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SEE  BEFORE. I THINK WE HAVE A BIT OF A  FEAR.
Stephen: AND HOW LONG  WILL IT TAKE ME TO FORGET  WHAT YOU TOLD ME TONIGHT.
THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR  POWERS OF FORGETTING.
Stephen: YOUR NAME IS  AGAIN? DANIEL BERGNER,  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WITH DISTURBING REVELATIONS  OF WHAT DO WOMEN WANT. WE KNOW, WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK.
