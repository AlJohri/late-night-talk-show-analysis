Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW BOOK AND TV SERIES CALLED "HOW WE GOT TO NOW." I TOOK A LIMO PLEASE WELCOME STEVEN JOHNSON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, STEVEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU? THANKS FOR COMING BACK. THIRD TIME HERE. THREE TIME'S A CHARM. THANKS FOR LOOSENING YOUR TIE. LOOKING CASUAL.
I WORE A TIE, I THOUGHT I MIGHT TRY AND MATCH
Stephen: SIR, YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF EIGHT BEST-SELLING BOOKS INCLUDING "EVERYTHING BAD IS GOOD FOR YOU" AND "WHERE GOOD IDEAS COME FROM." YOUR LATEST IS "HOW WE GOT TO NOW." SIX INNOVATIONS THAT MADE THE MODERN WORLD.
THAT IS CORRECT.
Stephen: IS AMERICA ONE OF THOSE INNOVATIONS.  IT'S THE GREATEST INNOVATION MANKIND EVER GOT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMERICANS IN THE BOOK, SO IF THAT'S ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOU.
Stephen: WHAT ARE THE SIX INNOVATIONS. BOOM LET'S DO IT, LET'S BUZZFEED THEM
ONE OF THEM IS A GLASS OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN A LARGE METROPOLITAN CITY. THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY BREAKTHROUGH.
Stephen:  WHICH IS THE INNOVATION, THE GLASS OR THE WATER? THE WATER. THE FACT THAT YOU CAN DRINK A GLASS OF WATER FROM A TAP AND NOT WORRY ABOUT DYING OF TYPHOID THREE DAYS LATER.
Stephen: YOU CAN, BUT, OF COURSE, YOU'RE GOING TO DRINK MOUNTAIN DEW. SO WATER.
YEAH, ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.
Stephen: THERE WE GO.
THE ABILITY TO RECORD THE SOUND AND TRANSMIT THE SOUND --
Stephen:  WE'RE DOING THAT, TOO.
THE SIMPLE MATERIAL GLASS, WHICH WAS ARGUABLY THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MATERIAL OF THE LAST 1,000 YEARS.
Stephen: THE GLASS LENSES ON THESE CAMERAS, WHAT ELSE?
AND THEN THERE IS CLOCKS AND TIME. WITHOUT ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF TIME AND COLD-- TECHNOLOGIES OF REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING.
Stephen: SO, CLOCKS, WE'RE ON A CERTAIN TIME RIGHT NOW.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND REFRIGERATION. I'M SUPER COOL. SO ALL OF THE-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN REFRIGERATION? REFRIGERATORS ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF THOSE THINGS, TOO. THEY REFRIGERATE, LIGHT INSIDE, GLASS SHELVES, WATER OUT OF DOOR. THE REFRIGERATOR IS THE ENCAPSULATION OF ALL THAT IS GOOD ABOUT INVENTIONS.
YOU BROUGHT IT ALL TOGETHER.
Stephen:  WAIT, SO HOW DID WE GET TO NOW? HOW DID WE GET REFRIGERATION? THAT'S ACTUALLY--
SO REFRIGERATION, THAT STORY BEGINS WITH A CRAZY GUY NAMED FREDERICK TUDOR WHO IN THE EARLY 1800s HAD THIS IDEA THAT HE COULD TAKE LARGE BLOCKS OF ICE FROM FROZEN NEW ENGLAND LAKES AND SHIP THEM ALL THE WAY TO RIO, AND BOMBAY AND THE CARIBBEAN, SELL WHAT WAS  EFFECTIVELY FREE IN NEW ENGLAND, SEE IT TO PEOPLE IN HOT PLACES IN THE WORLD. IF YOU WERE GROWING UP IN THE CARIBBEAN IN 1800 YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ICE IN ANY FORM. HE ACTUALLY MANAGED TO DO THIS.
Stephen: THEN HOW DID THEY MAKE THOSE DELICIOUS DAIQUIRIS.
EXACTLY. THEY HAD NO IDEA.
Stephen: REALLY? BEFORE THAT THEIR DAQUIRIS WERE HOT?
STEAMING HOT DAIQUIRI. IT WAS DELIGHTFUL. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, THE POOL SCENE WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. IT WAS LIKE, THIS IS SO HOT.
Stephen: NO ONE'S GOING TO SANDALS
BUT HERE'S THE THING. HE ACTUALLY MANAGES TO GET THESE BLOCKS OF ICE THERE WHICH IS AMAZING HE GOT IT THERE WITHOUT IT MELTING. BUT WHEN IT ARRIVED, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH THAT? I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE 500 YEARS AND NEVER HAD ANY ISSUE NEEDING ICE," SO NO ONE WANTED TO BUY IT. HE HAD TO CONVINCE LOCALS THAT ICE CREAM WAS A NICE THING AND HAVING DAIQUIRI BY THE POOL WAS A NICE THING AND EVENTUALLY MADE HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHIPPING ICE BLOCKS AROUND THE WORLD.
Stephen: BUT THAT'S NOT AIR CONDITIONING. I DON'T MEAN TO BLOW THE DOORS OFF YOUR BOOK. SO--
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST, SO I DON'T --
Stephen:  OKAY, PERFECT. NOW, HERE'S THE THING, I LOVE BOOKS LIKE THIS. I LOVE TV SHOWS LIKE THIS. I LOVE WATCHING THIS STUFF. I DON'T WANT TO USE ANY OF THIS INFORMATION IN POLICY MAKING. THIS IS A VERY POPULAR SHOW ON PBS. THIS IS A VERY POPULAR BOOK. HOW COME POLITICIANS DON'T WANT TO USE THE SCIENCE? WHY DO THEY RUN AWAY FROM IT WHEN THEY GET TO OFFICE?
I THINK BECAUSE SOMETIMES SCIENCE ASKS THAT WE ALTER OUR BEHAVIOR IN SOME WAY. ONE OF THE WAYS AC, ONCE IT WAS INTRODUCED, ALL THESE PEOPLE MIGRATED -- IT TRIGGERED THE LARGEST MIGRATION OF HUMAN BEINGS IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE THEY MOVED TO THE SUNBELT AND MOVED TO FLORIDA AND THESE DESERT STATES WHERE MAYBE THAT MANY PEOPLE SHOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE LIVING. AND IT TRIGGERED CLIMATE PROBLEMS, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLIMATE SCIENCE, IT DOES REQUIRE SOMETIMES THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THAT.
Stephen: SO AIR CONDITIONING ITSELF MOVED PEOPLE TO PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WERE NORMALLY TOO HOT TO LIVE IN AND THEN THEY NEEDED MORE AIR CONDITIONING TO COOL IT DOWN.
THAT IS PARTIALLY THE CYCLE
Stephen:  WHY DON'T WE BUILD A BIGGER AIR CONDITIONER  FOR THE ENTIRE EARTH?
YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING.
Stephen: HOW DID AIR CONDITIONING LEAD TO REAGAN?
THAT'S THE THING, ALL THESE PEOPLE-- IT'S TRUE. I KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE'S A HERO OF YOURS. RIGHT AFTER AIR CONDITIONING IS INTRODUCED, THERE'S A MASS MIGRATION TO THE SOUTH, AND THAT ENDS UP TRIGGERING A HUGE SWING IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AIR, 60-VOTE SWING FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH AND REAGAN WINS IN 1980 BUILT AROUND THIS SUNBELT COALITION THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T EXIST 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO. WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING, IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE RONALD REAGAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Stephen:  SO THE GREATEST GIFT GOD EVER GAVE MANKIND WAS FREON. THAT AND FIVE OTHER GREAT INVENTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. STEVEN JOHNSON, "HOW WE GOT TO NOW." THE FINALE IS NEXT WEDNESDAY ON PBS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
