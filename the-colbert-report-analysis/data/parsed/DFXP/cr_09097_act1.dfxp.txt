Stephen: TONIGHT, A VAST  GOVERNMENT COVER-UP. TURNS OUT THE SOCIAL SECURITY  NUMBERS THEY GAVE US ARE ALL  DIFFERENT. THEN HOW CAN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  APPEAL TO YOUNG PEOPLE? WELL, THEY COULD TRY MAKING IT  THE SERMON ON THE MOUNTAIN DEW. AND MY GUEST ROBERT CARO IS HERE  WITH HIS FOURTH BOOK ON LYNDON  JOHNSON. I BELIEVE IT'S L.B.J. AND THE  GOBLET OF FIRE. CHRIS CHRISTIE KILLED A SPIDER. IT PICKED THE WRONG GUY TO STEAL  CURDS AND WHEY FROM. THIS IS THE COLBERT REPORT.  Captioning sponsored by   COMEDY CENTRAL  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! tephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, FOLKS. PLEASE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOLKS, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, I  AM SUPER TIGHT WITH MEDIA MOGUL  AND THING-FAVORITER OPRAH  WINFREY. WE HAVE THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP  WHERE YOU CAN GO YEARS WITHOUT  SEEING EACH OTHER AND WE PICK UP RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF. OR AT LEAST I ASSUME WE WILL  WHEN WE MEET FOR THE SECOND  TIME. OF COURSE I'M A HUGE FAN OF O,  OPRAH'S BOOK CLUB. THAT'S WHY I STARTED O,  C"O"LBERT'S BOOK CLUB AS A  TRIBUTE AND AS A THEFT.
NOW, FOLKS, OUR FIRST BOOK IS  THE GREAT GATSBY BY F. SCOTT  FITZGERALD. LOOK FOR IT IN BOOKSTORES  BETWEEN E.E. CUMMINGS AND G. GORDON LIDDY. IT'S CLEARLY A TOWERING PILLAR  OF WESTERN LITERATURE BECAUSE IT  IS NOW A 3D MOVIE. AND I HOPE YOU'VE STARTED  READING, FOLKS, BECAUSE ON  THURSDAY PULITZER-PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR JENNIFER EGAN WILL LEAD  MY BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION, AND I  WILL BE JOINED BY DIRECTOR BAZ  LURHMAN. LIKE ALL BOOK CLUBS WE'LL OPEN A  BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY, TALK  BROADLY ABOUT THEMES AND THEN LAUNCH INTO A HEATED DISCUSSION  ABOUT THE NEIGHBOR WHO LEAVES  HIS TRASH BIN OUT ON THE CURB FOUR DAYS AFTER PICK UP. YOU'RE ALREADY OUT THERE TO GET  THE MAIL, ALAN, HOW HARD IS IT  JUST TO BRING IT BACK IN? SERIOUSLY. UNFORTUNATELY SOMEONE HAS  ALREADY RIPPED OFF MY IDEA TO  RIP OFF OPRAH'S IDEA. THIS WEEK THE B.B.C. WORLD BOOK  CLUB IS ALSO FEATURING THE GREAT  GATSBY. WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED. THE BRITS ARE ALWAYS COPYING OUR  BEST IDEAS. THEY DID IT WITH THE OFFICE. DA ALI G SHOW AND DOWNTON ABBEY  WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS IS BASED ON  FRIENDS. IT'S SO UNREALISTIC. SO UNREALISTIC. THERE IS NO WAY THOSE KIDS COULD  AFFORD THAT ABBEY. SO IF YOU'RE ALSO READING GATSBY  FOR THE B.B.C., YOU HAVE TO READ  IT ONCE FOR EACH CLUB. THE AMERICAN VERSION FOR MINE. FOR THEIRS THE ENGLISH VERSION. ALL THE CHAPTERS ARE IN CELSIUS. INSTEAD OF WEST EGG, GATSBY  LIVES IN EAST BANGERS-UPON-MASH. NOW I'LL BE READING RIGHT UP  UNTIL MY FIRST BOOK CLUB MEETING  THURSDAY WHEN I ASSUME WE WILL DISCUSS HOW THIS OPULENT  CONSEQUENCE-FREE LIFESTYLE  REACHES ITS INEVITABLE HAPPY  ENDING. FOLKS, I HOPE YOU HAD A GREAT  WEEKEND. I DID. I SPENT IT AT THE BIG ANNUAL  N.R.A. MEETING IN HOUSTON,  TEXAS. NOT TO BE CONFUSED... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YES, THE ANNUAL N.R.A. MEETING  IN HOUSTON TEXAS NOT TO BE  CONFUSED WITH THE DAILY N.R.A. MEETING THAT IS HOUSTON, TEXAS. AND THIS YEAR'S THEME WAS  ACCESSORIES. LIKE PINK ASSAULT RIFLES AND BRA  HOLSTERS. NOW, FELLOWS CAN BRAG ABOUT  GETTING TO SECOND AMENDMENT. ONE THING I HER REPEATEDLY DOWN  THERE THIS WEEKEND IS THAT OBAMA  IS COMING FOR OUR GUNS. NOW I'M NOT ONE TO BELIEVE IN  FAROUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES  PROBABLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IMPLANTED A CHIP IN MY BRAIN  THAT CONTROLS MY THOUGHTS. BUT, FOLKS, I'VE HAD MY EYES  OPENED TO SOME DISTURBING TRUTHS  THAT RAISE TROUBLING QUESTIONS LIKE, "WHAT DID THEY KNOW? WHEN DID THEY KNOW IT? AND WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT? WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEW  SEGMENT EXPOSING VAST GOVERNMENT  CONSPIRACIES, STEPHEN COLBERT'S BAT [BLEEP] SERIOUS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, FOLKS, I'VE WANTED TO DO  THIS SEGMENT FOR A LONG TIME. BUT I HAVEN'T. WHY NOT? WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT NEXT TIME. BUT TONIGHT'S TOPIC: ARE THEY  COMING AFTER OUR GUNS? NO. THEY'RE COMING AFTER OUR  BULLETS.
WHY IS THE DEPARTMENT OF  HOMELAND SECURITY USING ROUGHLY  A THOUSAND ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION MORE PER PERSON THAN THE U.S. ARMY?
YOU HAVE A HOMELAND SECURITY  DEPARTMENT THAT'S STOCK PILING  AMMUNITION AND KIND OF NOT TELLING US WHY. WE DON'T TRUST THEM.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY IS PURCHASING 1.6  BILLION ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY DID BUY 1.6 BILLION  ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION.
Stephen: 1.6 BILLION ROUNDS? WHAT ARE THEY TRYING TO DO? FILM A QUINTIN TARANTINO MOVIE? NATION, FOLLOW ME DOWN THE  RABBIT HOLE. IF IT EVEN IS A RABBIT AND NOT A  GROUND HOG IN A COSTUME. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S  SUSPICIOUS AMMO HOARDING WAS  FIRST NOTICED BY VIGILANT ONLINE CONSPIRACY FORUMS BEFORE IT WAS  PICKED UP BY CONSERVATIVE RADIO  HOSTS AND THEN EVENTUALLY MADE ITS WAY OUT TO THE FARTHEST  FRINGE ELEMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY,  CONGRESS. JIM?
360,000. THAT'S HOW MANY ROUNDS OF  HOLLOW-POINT AMMUNITION THE  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY PLANS TO BUY. IT'S ALREADY BOUGHT MORE THAN  TWO BILLION. CONGRESS DEMANDING ANSWERS AS TO  WHY THEY NEED ALL THOSE BULLETS. CAN SOMEONE ANSWER, PLEASE? HELLO!
Stephen: PLEASE? HELLO? WHO'S THERE? DOLORES? GET ME KLONDIKE 6-4,000. THIS ISN'T EVEN ATTACHED TO  ANYTHING. WHAT'S HAPPENING? NOW, FOLKS, LEADING... LEADING... LEADING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). LEADING THE CONGRESSIONAL CHARGE  IS SENATOR JAMES INHOFE, IF THIS  IS JAMES INHOFE AND NOT A GROUND HOG IN A COSTUME. SENATOR GROUND-HOFE HERE  RECENTLY INTRODUCED A BILL THAT  WOULD BAN FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM BUYING MORE AMMUNITION IF IT  CURRENTLY POSSESSES MORE THAN  ITS MONTHLY AVERAGES DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. YES, NOT INCLUDING THE AMMO THAT  ENDED UP IN THE FACES OF THE  FRIENDS OF DICK CHENEY. FOLKS, I KNOW, I KNOW, IT'S A  SAD STORY. ISN'T IT? I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S SO SAD. HE WAS FINE. FOLKS, SENATOR INHOG'S BILL  COULDN'T HAVE COME AT A BETTER  TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME VERY DISTURBING THEORIES AS TO WHY  THE GOVERNMENT WANTS ALL THAT  AMMO.
SOME PREDICT A GOVERNMENT  ARMS RACE AGAINST AMERICANS.
I SUSPECT THAT JUST IN CASE  OUR FISCAL SITUATION, OUR  MONETARY SITUATION COLLAPSES, AND FOLLOWING IT THE CIVIL  SOCIETY COLLAPSES, THAT IS THE  RULE OF LAW, THAT THEY WANT TO BE PREPAREDDED. THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION  FOR THIS.
Stephen: YES. THERE'S NO OTHER EXPLANATION. I MEAN, THE GOVERNMENT IS BUYING  UP AMMO SO THAT FOLLOWING THE  ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, THEY CAN OUTGUN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THEY NEED IT BECAUSE RIGHT  NOW ALL THEY'VE GOT AREï¿½r TANKS,  AIRPLANES, HELICOPTERS, PREDATOR DRONES, NUCLEAR MISSILES, AND  LASER CANNONS. BUT IF I GET MY HAND ON A BOX OF  SHOTGUN SHELLS, IT IS GO TIME,  UNCLE FATTY. OH, AND THERE'S ONLY OTHER ONLY  ONE EXPLANATION FOR THE  GOVERNMENT BUYING ALL THIS AMMO.
SUB TER FUSION. THE REGIME IS BUYING UP ALL  THE AMMO SO THAT THE GUNS THAT  YOU DO HAVE ARE USELESS.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. IF OBAMA CAN'T TAKE OUR GUNS,  HE'LL MAKE SURE YOU CAN'T PUT  ANYTHING IN THEM. AFTER THAT, HE'S GOING TO COME  AFTER RUSH BY BUYING UP ALL THE  HOOKERS AND CANNED FROSTING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, FOLKS, A LOT OF NEWS  OUTLETS INCLUDING FOX NEWS SAY  THAT THEY HAVE DEBUNKED THE BULLET CONSPIRACY THEORY, BUT I  SAY IT'S ALREADY STARTED. BECAUSE OUT OF FEAR OF  GOVERNMENT HOARDING, AMMO SALES  HAVE SKYROCKETED MAKING IT HARDER TO FIND AMMO WHICH CAN  ONLY MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS  HOARDING IT WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO BUY MORE AMMO BEFORE THE  GOVERNMENT GETS IT ALL BUT  THERE'S NONE LEFT BECAUSE WE BOUGHT IT. OH, MY GOD. IT'S TOO LATE. THE FEDS ALREADY HAVE US  OUTGUNNED. WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE  ME ALIVE. [BLEEP] I'M OUT OF AMMO. I'M STILL ALIVE AND RICH AND  HAPPY. YOU WIN THIS ROUND, OBAMA. IF THAT IS YOU. OH, MY GOD. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT'S  BAT [BLEEP] SERIOUS. JOIN ME NEXT TIME WHEN I ASK THE  QUESTION, DID BIG FOOT HELP LEE  HARVEY OSWALD BUILD STONE HENGE? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
