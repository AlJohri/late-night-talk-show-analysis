(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I FOR ONE AM JUST SICK AND TIRED OF ALL THE LEFTIE LIBERAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS TRYING TO GUILT ME INTO DOING THINGS LIKE RECYCLING AND ENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHT BULBS AND NOT THROWING OLD CAR BATTERIES INTO THE TANK AT SEA WORLD. YES, THOSE GREENS HAD ME SEEING RED UNTIL THIS NEW TREND BLEW MY MIND. (LAUGHTER) MAGENTA.
IF YOU SEE A TRUCK IN FRONT OF YOU BELCHING OUT CLOUDS OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, COULD BE TROUBLE. OR COULD BE A NEW TREND CALLED ROLLING COAL.
DRIVERS PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO SHOOT BLACK SMOKE AT OTHER PEOPLE ON THE ROAD.
A NEW TREND CALLED ROLLING COAL.
ROLLING COAL, THAT'S WHAT IT IS CALLING.
OW, ROLLING COAL OR AS WE USED TO CALL IT A CLOGGED  AIR FILTER. FOR TOO LONG THOSE EARTH HUGGERS HAVE SHOVED THEIR AGENDA DOWN OUR THROAT. FINALLY THERE IS A WAY TO SHOVE OUR AGENDA DOWN THEIR LUNGS. SO HOW DOES ROLLING COAL WORK? OR BASED ON WHAT I KNOW ABOUT EXHAUST SYSTEMS, NOT.
THE WAY THIS WORKS IS DIESEL VEHICLES ARE MODIFIED TO INCREASE FUEL TO THE ENGINE. THE EXTRA FUEL THAT IT BURNS OFF AS THICK BLACK SMOKE. AND IF YOU ADD IN A SMOKE STACK OR TWO THE COST OF RIGGING YOUR RIG TO ROLL COAL CAN BE ABOUT $5,000.
Stephen: $5,000. SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S WAY CHEAPER THAN STRAPPING A WEBER TO YOUR TESLA. (LAUGHTER) AND ROLLING COAL ISN'T JUST SMOKE BELCHING PUBLIC NUISANCE, IT'S A SMOKE BELCHING PUBLIC MESSAGE.
SOME SAY THEY ROLL COAL BECAUSE IT'S FUN BUT MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE DOING IT ARE MAKING A POLITICAL STATEMENT. EITHER THUMBING THEIR NOSES AT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS OR JUST PLAIN FLIPPING OFF ENVIRONMENTALISTS OR AS THEY CALL THEM NATURE NUFFIES, THE ONES WHO HATE ON HUMMERS TRUCKS AND SUVs BUT LOVE THEIR PRIUS. IN FACT, THE BLACK SOOT SPEWED BY COAL ROLLERS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS PRIUS REPELLENT.
YEAH, BABY, PRIUS REPELLENT. THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO KEEP A PRIUS AWAY FROM YOU IS DRIVING OVER 45 MILES PER HOUR. NOW A LOT OF COAL ROLLERS, FOLKS, A LOT OF COAL ROLLERS OR CO-ROS AS NO ONE EVER CALLS THEM ARE EVEN UPLOADING HILARIOUS VIDEOS OF THEM BLASTING SMOKE AT PEOPLE STUPID ENOUGH TO WALK OR RIDE A BIKE. AND IT'S GREAT FOR MEETING THE BABES.
DO YOU SMOKE?
YES, I DO.
STAND BY.
THAT WOULD MAKE ANY WOMAN SWOON. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF BRAIN DAMAGE. AND THEY DON'T DO TO ANYONE ELSE WHAT THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO DO TO THEMSELVES.
YOU SEE THAT, CLEAN AIR CROWD? YOU SEE THAT? IF YOU ARE AGAINST COAL ROLLING, YOU HATE BLACK PEOPLE. AND IF YOU ASK ME, THAT'S SHAMEFUL. AND IF YOU ASK ME, WOULD YOU IMPLICITLY DID BY WATCHING THIS SHOW, I SAY COAL ROLLING IS THE BEST NEW WAY TO STICK IT TO MOTHER EARTH SINCE PAINT CANNIN' WHERE YOU DUMP OLD PAINT INTO A RIVER. OR PORPOISE CORKING WHERE YOU HAMMER CORKS INTO THE BLOW HOLES OF DOLPHINS. WELL, WELL, FOLKS, I WANT IN. TONIGHT I AM ROLLING THIS, THIS BABY IS PURRING WITH A PURE 4 CANON DIESEL ENGINE BLADE RUNNER MANIFOLD AND-- A PAIR OF NUTS SO JIMMY, LET'S FIRE HER UP. WHOOO! (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH! YEAH! HOW'S THIS FEEL? HOW DOES THAT FEEL, LEFTIES? HUH? HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
