Stephen: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST IS AN ACCLAIMED COLLEGE BASKETBALL COACH. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN CALIPARI! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COACH, HOW ARE YOU?
DOING GOOD.
Stephen: THANKS FOR COMING ON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE THE HEAD COACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY, MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM, LED ONE TO A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, HELPED 29 PLAYERS MAKE IT TO THE NBA AND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK HERE CALLED PLAYERS FIRST, COACHING FROM THE INSIDE OUT. PLAYERS FIRST? DON'T WE HAVE TO START WITH THE COACH? (LAUGHTER) YOU PUT THE-- YOU'RE BEING TOO HUMBLE, SIR, YOU PUT THE TEAM TOGETHER. WITHOUT YOU IT'S JUST FIVE TALL GUYS STARING AT THEIR SHOES. WHY PLAYERS FIRST?
WELL, YOU'RE TRYING TO BRING A TEAM TOGETHER. YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH THEM SERVANT LEADERSHIP.
Stephen: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
WELL, SORRY.
Stephen: YOU'RE EITHER A SERVANT OR YOU'RE A LEADER. THE LEADER LEADS THE SERVANTS.
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND IT'S MORE ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS THAN THEMSELVES. WORRY MORE ABOUT YOUR TEAMMATE THAN YOURSELF.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. GIVE ME THE BALL, I'M SHOOTING.
AN IF YOU DO THAT, THE ONLY WAY THEY'LL DO THAT IS IF THEY KNOW I HAVE THEIR BACK AND I MAKE IT ABOUT THEM, NOT ABOUT ME, NOT ABOUT ME-- IT'S ABOUT ME AND OUR STAFF AND ALL OF US BEING THERE FOR YOU.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU'RE CRITICIZED SOMETIMES FOR HAVING A LOT OF ONE AND DONE GUYS, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, ONE AND DONE AND CAN THAT BE CURED WITH VIAGRA, WHAT IS THAT?
MY, I DON'T LIKE THE CONNOTATION ONE AND DONE. WE SAY SUCCEED AND PROCEED. WHEN THEY'RE READY TO MOVE ON-- .
Stephen: IT ALSO RHYMES SO IT MUST BE TRUE.
IT'S NOT BAD. BUT THE WHOLE ISSUE FOR ME IS IF THEY'RE READY IF THEY HAVE A GENIUS AND THEIR GENIUS IS BASKETBALL, THEIR ATHLETICISM AND ARE READY TO MOVE ON AND TAKE ADVANTAGE, LIKE STEVE JOBS, LIKE BILL GATES OR TIGER WOODS OR-- .
Stephen: NONE OF THOSE GUYS PLAYED BASKETBALL.
BUT THEY'RE ALL ABLE TO USE THEIR GENIUS AND NOT FINISH COLLEGE AND MOVE ON AND DO SPECIAL THINGS.
Stephen: OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE ONE AND DONE, DO YOU THINK PLAYERS SHOULD STAY MORE THAN A YEAR?
I WOULD LIKE THEM TO STAY TWO, BUT AGAIN, THEIR GENIUS DICTATES, IS IT TIME TO GO. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO PLAYERS ON THIS TEAM DECIDE THEY'RE GOING TO THE NBA, JAMES YOUNG AND JULYIANCE RANDALL, TWO GREAT KIDS, GREAT STUDENTS, GREAT BASKETBALL PLAYERS. BUT IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO MOVE ON. WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FOR A COUPLE OF OTHERS. A BUNCH OF OUR GUYS SAID THEY ARE COMING BACK. FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD A COUPLE GUYS COME BACK, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: FOR THE FIRST TIME.
YES, THEY ALL LEAVE.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP THAT MAKES PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE.
I THINK THEY DONE LIKE ME. AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT. THE OTHER COACH, DO THEY LIKE THE OTHER COACH MORE THAN THEY LIKE ME? THEY ALL STAY BUT ALL GUYS ALL LEAVE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
Stephen: NOW IF YOU COULD GET THEM TO STAY FOR TWO YEARS THIS MIGHT HELP YOU. HERE IS ANOTHER RHYME, TWO AND TOOTALOO, ALL RIGHT? I CAN GET A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT IN CASE THAT WORKS OUT.
WELL, I WOULD LET YOU KNOW HOW IT DOES.
Stephen: I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT.
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THAT PLAYERS, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE UNIONIZATION OF COLLEGE PLATERS WITH SHABAZZ NAPIER SAID AT UCONN. DO YOU THINK PLAYERS SHOULD GET PAID?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THEY TALK ABOUT UNIONS, UNIONS AREN'T NECESSARY IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY AND TREAT THEM FAIR. THAT'S ONE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PAY, IT'S A COST OF ATTENDANCE. FOR A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN TO BE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS, TO BE ON SCHOLARSHIP, BUT NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE THE SAME LIVES AS EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE CAMPUS IS A TOUGH DEAL. SO THE COST OF THAT ATTENDANCE WHICH CHANGES FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL.
Stephen: SO DO WE PAY THEM?
YOU GIVE THEM A COST OF ATTENDANCE, YES.
Stephen: AND THAT IS PAID IN WHAT, CHESTNUTS AND RABBIT PELTS, WHAT? DO WE GIVE THEM MONEY, THE GREEN STUFF.
YOU WOULD GIVE THEM THAT STIPEND WHICH DOES NOT MAKE THEM PROFESSIONAL.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
THAT IS-- .
Stephen: DOES IT HAVE PICTURES OF PRESIDENTS ON IT?
I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO ON THIS ONE.
IT COULD BE IN HUNDREDS, QUARTERS, IT COULD BE IN A CHECK, YES.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, HOW MUCH DO WE GIVE THESE GUYS, YOU JUST OPENED UP A CAN OF WORMS, MY FRIEND. IF YOU-- WHY NOT JUST GIVE THEM LIKE A SNICKERS BAR IF THEY'RE HUNGRY. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY.
WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GIVE THEM SNICKERS BAR. WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GIVE THEM ANYTHING EXCEPT A BAGEL AND IF WE PUT PEANUT BUTTER OR JELLY ON OR CREAM CHEESE ON THE BAGEL, WE WERE GOING TO JAIL.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND, YOU COULD GIVE PLAYERS A BAGEL BUT NOT CREAM CHEESE.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL, BECAUSE THAT IS HOW YOU GET A SLIPPERY SLOPE IS BY PUTTING CREAM CHEESE ON THE SLOPE, IT LEADS TO LOX, MAYBE THIN SLICED ONION, CAPERS.
IT'S RIDICULOUS. AND THEY CHANGED THAT RULE. IT HADN'T BEEN PASSED YET BUT THEY SAY UNFETTERED FOOD. NOW WE CAN FEED THEM SIX TIMES A DAY OR FIVE TIMES A DAY, WHATEVER AN ATHLETE NEEDS.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT THEY CAN EAT.  WE CAN FEED THEM SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A TROUGH. YOU ARE JUST POURING-- TIME TO FEED THEM. EVERYBODY DOWN. I SAW YOU ON WITH MY HERO BILL O REILLY, OKAY. AND I WILL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. WHAT ARE WE GOING DO WITH THE YOUNG MEN WITH THE RAP AND HIP-HOP AND CHAINS AND TATTOOS? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THESE GUYS? WHAT CAN WE DO TO CONTROL THEM?
IT ISN'T-- THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NOT CHANGED.
Stephen: BUT THEY HAVE THE HIP-HOP AND THE RAP AND THE CHAINS AND THE TATTOOS.
ITS MUSIC HAS CHANGED BUT THE CLUTTER HAS CHANGED AROUND THEM. SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL THOSE THINGS. WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP EDUCATING, KEEP LEADING AND-- I DON'T THINK-- .
Stephen: TELL THEM TO KNOCK OFF THE HIP-HOP, AND RAP AND TATTOOS, RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM TO KNOCK IT OFF.
MY SON LISTENS TO THE SAME THINGS AND I TURN OFF WHEN I GET IN THE CAR BUT HE LISTENS TO IT I DON'T THINK IT'S MADE HIM ANY WORSE.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THOSE KIDS SHOULD DO? READ THIS BOOK. JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME, JOHN CALIPARI, THE BOOK IS PLAYERS FIRST. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
