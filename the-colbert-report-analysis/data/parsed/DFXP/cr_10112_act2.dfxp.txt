Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, FOLKS, BUT I FOR ONE GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN THE GENDERS WERE CLEARLY DEFINED. ONE WAS THE BREADWINNER, PANTS-WEARER AND CHANNEL-CHANGER-HAVER. THE OTHER WAS THE NURTURER, EMOTION-HAVER, AND WAS TRIANGLE-SHAPED. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW MEN ARE BECOMING WOMEN, WOMEN ARE BECOMING MEN, AND MY INBOX IS BECOMING FULL OF YOUR ANGRY LETTERS EVERY TIME I TALK ABOUT IT. I KNOW. I KNOW. I'M CIS-HETERO NAZI SCUM. I ACCEPT YOUR JUDGMENT. BUT NOW THE TRANS-GENDERS ARE TRANS-FORMING A NEW SEGMENT OF AMERICA.
MEDICARE PATIENTS MAY NOW APPLY TO HAVE SEX CHANGE OPERATIONS FUNDED BY YOU, THE TAXPAYER. AN APPEALS BOARD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SAYS THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR A THREE-DECADE-OLD RULE EXCLUDING THE PROCEDURE.
MEDICARE COVERS 49 MILLION SENIOR CITIZENS. IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW MANY MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE RULING. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WHO KNOWS?  COULD BE ALL 49 MILLION. OF COURSE THEN IT'S GONNA BE THE LGBT AARP. (APPLAUSE) THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RULED THAT THE SURGERY IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AND CAN NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTAL. BUT I SAY THIS RULING IS JUST A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO ALL OF US PAYING FOR GRANDMA'S HUMAN CENTIPEDE SURGERY, WHICH IS JUST A SCAM TO SCORE GROUP DISCOUNTS TO THE LION KING. BUT EVEN MORE DISTURBING THAN THE IDEA OF NANA AND PEE-POP PLAYING MR. POTATOHEAD "DOWNTOWN"... IS THAT IT VIOLATES THE TACIT AGREEMENT WE'VE REACHED WITH THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. I AGREE TO BE TOTALLY COOL WITH IT. WHICH I CLEARLY AM. WHICH "TIME MAGAZINE" CLEARLY IS AND WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE LOBBYING FOR THIS TRANSGENDERED WOMAN TO BE A VICTORIA'S SECRET MODEL CLEARLY ARE... AS LONG AS YOU ARE HOT. BUT NOW YOU WANT ME TO ACCEPT "UNATTRACTIVE" TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE?! WHERE DOES IT END? WILL I HAVE TO ACCEPT UNATTRACTIVE "NON"TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE? WHAT AM I, MADE OF, HUMANITY?I! BESIDES, MEDICARE PAYING FOR THIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT WASTE. BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT, AFTER A CERTAIN AGE, WHO CAN REALLY TELL MEN AND WOMEN APART? (LAUGHTER) THEY HAVE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF EAR HAIR, THE SAME PAPERY SKIN, EVEN THE SAME COLOGNE. (LAUGHTER)    SO INSTEAD OF TAXPAYERS SPRINGING FOR SOME EXPENSIVE SURGERY TO TURN A MAN INTO A WOMAN, JUST GIVE HIM A FLORAL-PRINT MUUMUU. WATCH, JIMMY, PUT UP AN OLD MAN. NOW THE MUUMUU. (LAUGHTER) TA-DAA! (APPLAUSE)    YOU'RE WELCOME! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
