STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE  REPORT, EVERYBODY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NATION,  TONIGHT IT IS MY JOB, SADLY, TO  REPORT MORE DISTURBING NEWS FROM THE FOLKS OVER AT THE F.D.A. NOW I NEVER TRUSTED THESE  CLOWNS. WHO ARE THEY TO TELL ME HOW MANY  FLINTSTONE VITAMINS I CAN EAT? I SAY IT'S A GREAT BREAKFAST  CEREAL. BECAUSE IT ALREADY CONTAINS SO  MUCH CALCIUM, I CAN USE SODA  INSTEAD OF MILK. NATION, TODAY THEY PROVED THAT  F.D.A. REALLY STANDS FOR THE  FORNICATION DISTRIBUTION AGENDA.
THE MORNING-AFTER PILL IS  MOVING OVER THE COUNTER. THE F.D.A. ANNOUNCING THAT  PLAN-B, AS IT IS CALLED, WILL BE  AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 15 YEARS OLD AND NO  PRESCRIPTION NEEDED.
Stephen: SO THEY'RE HANDING  OUT HUSSY PILLS TO 15-YEAR-OLD  GIRLS LIKE CHICKLETS BUT I STILL NEED TO SHOW MY PASSPORT AND  PROVIDE A DNA SAMPLE TO BUY SOME  DAMNED SUDAFED. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE MY  METH? FOR MORE ON THIS SCANDAL WE TURN  TO AMERICA'S FOREMOST EXPERTS ON  YOUNG WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, CONSERVATIVE MEN IN  THEIR 60s.
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S VALUE  JUDGMENT THAT HE AND HIS  GOVERNMENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION CAN BRING ABOUT  SEXUAL FREEDOM WITHOUT  BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCE.
BECAUSE A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL  GETS TO GET ONE OF THESE EVERY  OTHER WEEK? IT'S ENCOURAGING THIS BEHAVIOR.
ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW IT'S 15  YEARS. SO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TWO  YEARS FROM NOW? SOMEBODY IS GOING TO MAKE  ANOTHER ARGUMENT AND THEY'RE  GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE IT SHOULD BE FROM THE  MOMENT THEY'RE BORN.
Stephen: SADLY, MANNY, I  THINK BABIES ARE ALREADY GETTING  THEIR HANDS ON IT. I'VE NEVER SEEN A PREGNANT ONE. WELCOME TO OBAMA'S AMERICA,  FOLKS. DON'T YOU SEE THE SHAME OF  HAVING TO ASK A MAN IN A LAB  COAT FOR SEX MEDICINE WAS AMERICA'S LAST DEFENSE ON THE  BORDER OF SLUT CITY. FOLKS, THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT  MORALITY. WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT? I WORK FOR VIACOM. AND TWO OF THE COMPANY'S BIGGEST  CASH COWS ARE TEEN MOM AND 16  AND PREGNANT. PLAN-B COULD OBLITERATE THESE  TREASURED FRANCHISES AND FRANKLY  NO ONE WANTS TO WATCH 34 FINANCIALLY STABLE AND PREGNANT. FOLKS, IT SEEMS THESE DAYS EVERY  TIME YOU TURN ON THE NEWS,  THERE'S ANOTHER HEART-BREAKING STORY ABOUT VICTIMS OF GUN  VIOLENCE TARGETING INNOCENT  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. IT HAS TO END. AND I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO WIN  ANY AWARDS FOR SAYING THAT. UNLESS THE N.R.A. GIVES OUT  AWARDS. THEY DO? OH, IT'S A SEAT IN THE SENATE. GREAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, THE LATEST SENSELESS VICTIM  OF THESE VICTIMS IS NEW  HAMPSHIRE SENATOR KELLY AYOTTE, ONE OF THE HEROES WHO VOTED TO  BLOCK THE GUN BILL THAT WOULD  HAVE EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS AND MADE AMERICANS WAIT 30  MINUTES AFTER EATING BEFORE  FIRING A GUN IN A POOL. WELL, YESTERDAY, THE SENATOR WAS  CAUGHT IN AN EMOTIONAL CROSS  FIRE WHEN AMBUSHED AT A TOWN HALL BY THE DAUGHTER OF THE  PRINCIPAL WHO WAS SLAIN AT SANDY  HOOK.
YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT THE  OWNERS OF GUN STORES THAT  EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS WOULD  CAUSE. I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THE  BURDEN OF MY MOTHER BEING GUNNED  DOWN IN THE HALLS OF HER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ISN'T AS  IMPORTANT AS THAT.
Stephen: IS IT OVER? FOLKS, I'M TELLING YOU, WE  CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DANGER  POSED BY THE VICTIMS OF GUN  VIOLENCE. THEY ARE SYMPATHETIC FIGURES WHO  ARE FANATICALLY COMMITTED TO  HAVING SOMEONE DO SOMETHING AND THEIR NUMBERS ARE GROWING EVERY  DAY. THAT'S WHY SENATOR JOE MANCHIN  WHO COSPONSORED THE ORIGINAL  BACKGROUND CHECK BILL HAS VOWED TO REINTRODUCE IT ALL ON THE  FLIMSY EXCUSE THAT OVER 90% OF  AMERICANS WANT IT. MAKING IT SLIGHTLY MORE POPULAR  THAN NACHO CHEESE AND  REACH-AROUNDS. NOT TO MENTION NACHO  REACH-AROUNDS. WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS THE WORST  DORITOS FLAVOR EVER. OBVIOUSLY, THOSE OF US WHO  OPPOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS COULD  ARGUE OUR CASE AGAIN. BUT OUR CASE HAS ONE WEAKNESS.
THERE WERE NO COHERENT  ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY WE WOULDN'T  DO THIS.
Stephen: FINE. THEN WHAT ABOUT INCOHERENT  ARGUMENTS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS  WILL LEAD TO A GUN REGISTRY AS OF A LOT BY BIG FOOT AND THE  ILLUMINATE TO REPLACE THE POPE  WITH THAT DOG FROM THE BUSH'S BAKED BEANS COMMERCIAL. BUT LUCKILY THERE'S A WAY WE CAN  DEFEAT THE FORCES OF "DOING  SOMETHING."  AND IT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S  WORD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). N.R.A.-VANA. NATION, ON MY VERY FIRST  BROADCAST OF THIS SHOW I COINED  THE WORD TRUTHINESS TO DESCRIBE THE NATURAL HUMAN DESIRE TO  IGNORE FACTS AND TO GO WITH WHAT  YOU FEEL IN YOUR GUT. AND TRUTHINESS WORKS. AFTER ALL, I WON A PULITZER FOR  IT. NO, BUT IT FEELS LIKE I DID. SADLY, WITH THE INCREASING  FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE OF MASS  SHOOTINGS, THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE WINNING THE  EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT. BUT SOME BRAVE AND HEARTLESS  INDIVIDUALS ARE WILLING TO FIGHT  BACK AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF  EMPATHY. LIKE NATIONAL REVIEW COLUMNIST  KEVIN D. WILLIAMSON WHO SAID OF  GABBY GIFFORDS, QUOTE, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BEING SHOT IN THE  HEAD BY A LUNATIC DOES NOT GIVE  ONE ANY SPECIAL GRACE TO PRONOUNCE UPON PUBLIC POLICY  QUESTIONS. OH, IT IS NOTED. EXPERIENCING MASSIVE HEAD TRAUMA  DOES NOT GIVE YOU SPECIAL  INSIGHT. FOR INSTANCE, JUDGING BY HIS  COLUMN, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG  WITH KEVIN WILLIAMSON'S HEAD. NOW, ANOTHER HERO IN THIS FIGHT  IS SENATOR RAND PAUL WHO SAID  THIS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE NEWTOWN FAMILIES.
I HATE TO SEE HIM USING  PEOPLE. I THINK AS PROPS AND  POLITICIZING PEOPLE'S TRAGEDY. I MEAN, WHEN I SEE THE FATHER  AND THE MOTHERS ANTHEM  TESTIFYING, IT STILL SADDENS ME JUST TO SEE THEM.
Stephen: HEY, NEWTOWN  PARENTS, STOP MAKING RAND PAUL  SAD. HE'S EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO HIS  OWN FEELINGS. I MEAN, WHAT I THINK RAND PAUL  REMINDS US US HERE IS THAT  GRIEVING FAMILIES AREN'T THE REAL VICTIMS. GUN OWNERS ARE. A POINT DRIVEN HOME BY  CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST BOB  DAVIS.
I'M SORRY THAT YOU SUFFERED A  TRAGEDY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? DEAL WITH IT AND DON'T FORCE ME  TO LOSE MY LIBERTY WHICH IS A  GREATER TRAGEDY THAN YOUR LOSS.
Stephen: YES, THE PARENTS OF  NEWTOWN ONLY LOST THEIR CHILDREN  BUT BOB DAVIS MIGHT HAVE TO FILL OUT SOME FORMS AT A GUN SHOW. THAT'S A PRECIOUS WASTE OF  TIME -- TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT  YELLING AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN. AND FOLKS, DAVIS, ALREADY KNOWS  WHAT HE'D YELL.
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING  THESE VICTIMS TROTTED OUT, GIVEN  RIDES ON AIR FORCE ONE, HAULED INTO THE SENATE WELL AND  EVERYONE IS JUST... THEY'RE  TERRIFIED OF THESE VICTIMS. I WOULD STAND IN FRONT OF THEM  AND TELL THEM GO TO HELL.
THEY'RE BEING USED. Stephen: FINALLY SOMEONE WITH  THE COURAGE TO TELL OFF THESE  NEWTOWN PARENTS TO THEIR FACES. AND FOLKS HE WOULD DO IT. IN FACT WHEN ONE SANDY HOOK  RESIDENT OFFERED TO PAY TO FLY  HIM OUT TO CONNECTICUT DAVIS PROVED HE NOT ONLY TALKS THE  TALK, HE WALKS THE... HASN'T  RESPONDED. WELL, HE'S PROBABLY BUSY  ANSWERING FAN MAIL. NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT BE  SAYING, STEPHEN, WON'T  DEMONIZING THE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE MAKE PEOPLE HATE US? NO, GREG. IT WON'T BECAUSE IT ALREADY HAS.
SENATOR, YOU VOTED NO ON THAT  BACKGROUND CHECK. ACCORDING TO A NEW P.P.P. POLL,  NEVADA SENATOR DEAN HELLER LOST  TWO POINTS OVER ALL. SENATOR MARK BEGICH OF ALASKA  DOWN SIX POINTS. HIS COLLEAGUE IN ALASKA  MURKOWSKI LOST 16 POINTS. SENATOR ROB PORTMAN OHIO OF LOST  A NET OF 18 POINTS. NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN KELLY  AYOTTE HAS SLID 15 POINTS.
Stephen: POOR KELLY AYOTTE. APPARENTLY NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS  DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THEIR STATE  MOTTO TO LIVE FREE AND DIE. BUT, FOLKS, TO WIN THE FIGHT  AGAINST THESE ENORMOUSLY POPULAR  MODEST GUN REGULATIONS, WE CAN'T CARE ABOUT THE VOTERS. WE CAN'T CARE ABOUT COHERENT  ARGUMENT. WE CAN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT WHAT  FEELS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND ALL  PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF POLITICAL  ENGAGEMENT AND HUMAN INTERACTION AND ACHIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE THE  ZEN BUDDHISTS CALL SATORI,  WHEREIN WE ARE BUT EMPTY VESSELS WAITING TO BE FILLED. THESE SENATORS MUST REACH A  STATE BEYOND TRUTHINESS, A  COMPLETE NONATTACHMENT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN KEEPING  THEIR JOBS. AND THAT'S THE WORD. WE'LL BE RIGHT
