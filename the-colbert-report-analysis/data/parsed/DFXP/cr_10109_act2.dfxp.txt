WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS, WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF AN EPIDEMIC. IF YOU'RE NOT WATCHING THIS SHOW RIGHT NOW IT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD. A DANGEROUS NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASE IS SPREADING ACROSS AMERICA, IT'S CALLED MERS AND IT'S ALREADY INFECTIONED OUR TV NEWS.
THE MERS VIRUS THAT BROKE OUT IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAS NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SPREAD FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER IN THE UNITED STATES. APPARENTLY THROUGH A HANDSHAKE.
THE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE FEVER, COUGH AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
A CREEPING, CONTAGIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY RESPIRATORY VIRUS HAS REACHED THE U.S. IT STANDS FOR MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME IT STARTED IN THE SAUDI PENINSULA BUT HAS NOW SPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE.
THAT'S RIGHT, MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME HAS INFILTRATED AMERICAN LUNGS. IT'S MICROSHARIA. (LAUGHTER) OUR CELLS COULD BE THE SLEEPER CELLS. ACCORDING TO THE CDC, SYMPTOMS OF MERS INCLUDE FEVER, COUGH AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH BUT ALSO WARN THAT SOME PEOPLE INFECTED WITH MERS SHOW NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL. SHOWING NO SYMPTOMS COULD BE A SYMPTOM SO IF YOU ARE FEELING GREAT RIGHT NOW IT MAY BE TOO LATE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE THE CDC CD-SAYS THERE'S NO REASON TO PANIC BECAUSE THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN THREE KNOWN CASES OF MERS IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT LOOK AT THE PERSON TO YOUR LEFT, THEN LOOK AT THE PERSON ON YOUR RIGHT. THERE'S THREE PEOPLE RIGHT THERE AND ONE OF THEM IS YOU. AND WHILE SCIENCE MAY NOT KNOW HOW IT SPREADS, THEY HAVE PINPOINTED THE ORIGIN OF MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY DISEASE. AND ON THIS ONE SCIENCE SOUNDS A LITTLE RACIST.
EXPERTS SAY IT MAY ORIGINATE WITH CAMELS.
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO PERSONS HAVING CLOSE CONTACT WITH CAMELS EITHER IN CARING FOR THE CAMELS OR IN PARTICULAR CONSUMING CAMEL PRODUCTS BEGIN TO DEVELOP THIS INFECTION.
SAUDI ARABIA WARNS THOSE DEALING WITH CAMELS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS. THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE URGE PEOPLE WHO COME IN CONTACT WITH CAMELS TO EXERCISE CAUTION AND FOLLOW PREVENTIVE MEASURES.
Stephen: THEY'RE BLAMING CAMELS. NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ASSOCIATE JOE CAMEL WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASE. (LAUGHTER) AND FOLKS, I--  (APPLAUSE)
I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS UPSET HERE. CAMEL OWNERS ALL OVER THE MIDDLE EAST ARE PROTESTING THIS SLUR BY FLOODING TWITTER WITH CAMEL-SMOOCHING SELFIES LIKE THESE. NOT TO MENTION ALL THE DISTURBING PHOTOS LIKE THESE OF DRY HUMPING. BUT NATION, I'M NOT TAKING THAT KIND OF RISK. I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO BREAK UP WITH MY CAMEL CAMIE. CAMIE, COME ON OUT HERE. IT'S CAMIE "THE COLBERT REPORT" CAMEL, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE) NOW CAMIE AND I, CAMIE AND I MET AT A PARTY LAST YEAR, I FORGET WHEN T WAS SOMETIME IN VERY, VERY LATE OCTOBER. IT WAS THE SAME NIGHT I MET MY GOOD FRIENDS BATMAN AND SEXY PIRATE. BUT WE HAVE BEEN INSPARABLE EVER SINCE. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CAMIE. YEAH. WELL, GIRL, GIRL, I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS. YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIT DOWN. (LAUGHTER) CAMIE, CAMIE, I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE END. IT'S NOT YOU, NO, CAMIE, IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME BEING DEATHLY AFRAID OF YOU. (LAUGHTER) BUT DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT LOOK. DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT LOOK. YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE IT NEVER MOVES. CAMIE THIS IS BOUND TO HAPPEN. AND PLUS IT'S JUST COSTING ME TOO MUCH MONEY ANYWAY. I DON'T KNOW WHY A CAMEL NEEDS TO STAY AT THE RITZ CARLTON. IN TWO DIFFERENT ROOMS. I GOTTA SAY FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS GOT A HUMPFUL OF WATER YOU SURE GO THROUGH A LOT OF MINIBAR BOURBON. IN FACT, CAMIE, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU FOR MY CREDIT CARD BACK. SO I GUESS THIS IS GOOD-BYE. BUT CAMIE, BEFORE WE GO, MAYBE ONE LAST KISS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW GO! GO BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND. CAMIE, WAIT. I'M GOING TO NEED THE OTHER CREDIT CARD. NOW GO ON, GET OUT OF HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
