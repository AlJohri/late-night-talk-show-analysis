Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. NATION, NATION, FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS, I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF WASHINGTON THINK TANKS. TOO MUCH THINK, NOT ENOUGH TANK. (LAUGHTER) BUT THIS WEEK I LEARNED THAT THERE IS SOMETHING EVEN WORSE THAN BEING A  CHIN-STROKING INTELLICTU-NERD -- AND THAT'S BEING A TRADER.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" NEWSPAPER  IS NOW REPORTS THAT MORE THAN A DOZEN PROMINENT WASHINGTON RESEARCH GROUPS, THINK TANKS, TOOK TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FOREIGN GOVERNMENT MONEY IN RECENT YEARS. SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES WERE ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO BUY INFLUENCE, PAYING THOSE THINK TANKS TO PUT THEIR POSITION IN A POSITIVE LIGHT. OR TO GAIN INFLUENCE WITH LAWMAKERS.
Stephen: YES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTERS ARE BUYING INFLUENCE. SO GOOD NEWS, AMERICA HAS AN EXPORT. AND FOLKS, THE CORRUPTION BY SUPPOSEDLY INDEPENDENT THINK TANKS LIKE THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION GOES DEEP. FOR INSTANCE, AFTER QATAR AGREED TO MAKE A $14.8 BILLION DONATION TO BROOKINGS, A VISITING FELLOW SAID HE HAS BEEN TOLD DURING HIS JOB INTERVIEW THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE POSITIONS CRITICAL OF THE QATARI GOVERNMENT. AND HIS ONLY ACCEPTED PRONUNCIATIONS OF THE COUNTRY. LIKE CUTTER, GUTTER, CUH-TAR OR QUISNOS. AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, JAPAN GAVE THE CENTER FOR STATEGIC INTERNATIONAL STUDIES GAVE AT LEAST 1.1 MILLION FOR,  QUOTE, RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FOR TRADE AND DIRECT INVESTMENT BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES. WHEN ASKED WHY, A JAPANESE EMBASSY SPOKESMAN EXPLAINED JAPAN IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST INTERESTING SUBJECT AROUND THE WORLD. NOTHING INTERESTING ABOUT JAPAN. TAKE AWAY THE WHALING, THE SEX ROBOTS AND STRAPPING MEATS TO THE HEADS OF TEENAGE GIRLS--  OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S BASICALLY OHIO. BUT THE NUMBER ONE FOREIGN INFLUENCE BUYER IS, SAY IT WITH ME, NORWAY. WHY DIDN'T YOU-- THE DAMN NOROUIES COMMITTED AT LEAST $24 MILLION TO AN ARRAY OF WASHINGTON THINK TANKS OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS TO RAISE NORWAY'S PROFILE. INCLUDING DONATIONS TO THE CENTER FOR GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT, THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL AND THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION. WHICH EXPLAINS THIS FOOTAGE FROM BROOKINGS RECENT SYMPOSIUM ON ERADICATING GLOBAL HUNGER. I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLD THAT THAT CHEF IS ACTUALLY SWEDISH. WHICH IS APPARENTLY NOT THE SAME THING AS NORWEGIAN? OKAY, MY MISTAKE. NORWAY SHOULD REALLY DO SOMETHING TO RAISE ITS PROFILE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
