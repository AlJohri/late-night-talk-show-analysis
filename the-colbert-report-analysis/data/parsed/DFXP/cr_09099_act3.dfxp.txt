( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ABC'S CHIEF  MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT. WHILE I'M INTERVIEWING HIM, MY  STAFF IS STEALING HIS  PRESCRIPTION PAD. PLEASE WELCOME DR. RICHARD  BESSER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HEY, RICHARD. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. OKAY. NOW AS I SAID, YOU'RE ABC NEWS  CHIEF HEALTH AND MEDICAL  CORRESPONDENT. AND YOU'VE GOT A NEW BOOK HERE  CALLED "TELL ME THE TRUTH,  DOCTOR: EASY TO UNDERSTAND ANSWERS TO YOUR MOST CONFUSING  AND CRITICAL HEALTH QUESTIONS."  WHAT ARE THE MOST CONFUSING HEALTH QUESTIONS OUT THERE?
A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE  HAVE ARE AROUND DIET AND  EXERCISE.
Stephen: SHOULD I DIET OR  EXERCISE?
ACTUALLY YOU NEED TO DO SOME  OF BOTH.
Stephen: MMMMM. IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT,  DIET IS THE MOST IMPORTANT  THING.
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL. BUT IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A  HEALTHY HEART AND HEALTHY BONES,  THERE'S WHERE EXERCISE IS REALLY  CRITICAL.
Stephen: DO I HAVE TO THOUGH  BECAUSE I'M A 40 (MUMBLING) MAN  AND CAN'T I JUST TAKE A TESTOSTERONE SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE  I SEE ALL KINDS OF ADS ON, I'M  GUESSING ALSO, ABC NEWS THAT TELL ME THAT I'VE GOT LOW-T AND  I SHOULD RUB OILS ON MY BODY. AND THEN I'LL BE ALL MANLY.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT  OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS DRUGS  NEED TO GO THROUGH TESTING AND APPROVAL BEFORE THEY CAN SAY  THOSE THINGS. SUPPLEMENTS, VITAMINS, THEY CAN  TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE DEFICIENT  IN TESTOSTERONE AND THIS WILL IMPROVE YOUR SEX LIFE BUT THEY  DON'T HAVE TO PROVE...
Stephen: THOSE TESTOSTERONE  SUPPLEMENTS THAT YOU SEE ON TV,  WHERE THEY SAY AFTER LOOKING AT THE PACKAGING FOR THIS, WASH  YOUR CHILDREN, YOU KNOW? SUPER DANGEROUS STUFF LIKE, YOU  KNOW, BURN YOUR FAUCET IF YOU  WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER APPLYING. LEAVE YOUR FAMILY LIVE IN A  CAVE. THAT'S NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA?
WELL, IF YOU'D LIKE AT THE  LABEL THERE'S A TINY AFTER RISK. THE CLAIMS HAVE NOT BEEN  APPROVED BY THE FDA.
Stephen: (WHISTLING) IT  SOUNDS LIKE MEDICINE.
IT DOES. THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM. YOU CAN'T TELL LOOKING AT IT  WHICH IS A REAL DRUG AND WHICH  ONE HASN'T...
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT VITAMINS  AND STUFF LIKE THAT?
YOU KNOW,... Stephen: MULTI-S, BABY. I'M NOT A BELIEVER IN  MULTIVITAMINS.
Stephen: ARE YOU TELLING ME  THAT FRED FLINTSTONE IS LYING TO  ME? YABBA-DABBA-WHAT?
THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO  NEED VITAMINS.
Stephen: WHO WHAT? IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL  CONDITIONS, IF YOU'RE A PREGNANT  WOMAN YOU NEED VITAMINS.
Stephen: I'M NOT A PREGNANT  WOMAN.
IT MAY BE THAT YOU DON'T NEED  ANY VITAMINS WHATSOEVER.
Stephen: ANNUAL CHECK-UPS. YOU'RE NOT A BIG FAN.
I'M NOT. Stephen: HOW AM I GOING TO  CATCH THE THING, I MEAN CATCH  THE THING THAT'S HAPPENING TO  ME.
IF YOU SPENT 90% OF YOUR  VISIT WITH THE DOCTOR TALKING TO  THEM INSTEAD OF 90% SITTING ON A TABLE WITH A PAPER GOWN, YOU  WOULD GET SOMETHING OUT OF THAT  VISIT. BUT MOST OF THE TIME THEY'RE  EITHER LISTENING TO YOUR HEART  AND DOING THINGS. YOUR BODY WILL TELL YOU WHEN  SOMETHING IS GOING WRONG MUCH  SOONER THAN A DOCTOR WILL PICK THAT UP.
Stephen: I COULD JUST STAY IN  TUNE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON MY  BODY?
YES. Stephen: THAT WORKS MAYBE  MORE FOR THE LADIES BECAUSE I  THINK LADIES ARE MORE IN TUNE WITH THEIR BODIES. MEN ARE LIKE, WE WOULDN'T EVEN  BATHE UNLESS THERE WERE LADIES  AROUND. HONEST TO GOD, A GUY FEELS A  LUMP IN HIS THROAT AND HE GOES,  GREAT, A THIRD TESTIMONYICAL.
I THINK THERE IS SOME TRUTH  TO THAT. MOST OF THE MEDICAL DECISIONS IN  FAMILIES ARE MADE BY THE WOMEN. IT'S A WOMAN WHO IS MAKING AN  APPOINTMENT FOR HER HUSBAND AND  FOR THE CHILDREN. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. THE MORE YOU CAN LISTEN TO YOUR  BODY THE HEALTHIER YOU'LL BE  BECAUSE YOU'LL PICK UP THOSE THINGS WHEN IT'S EARLY AND THEN  IT CAN BE DIAGNOSED AND TREATED  PROPERLY.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT  DOCTORS ON TV IF YOU'LL PARDON  THE EXPRESSION. YOU'RE A DOCTOR ON TV.
I AM. Stephen: IF THEY'RE ON TV, I  SHOULD TRUST THEM, RIGHT?
NOT EXACTLY. Stephen: THE FDA DOES NOT  HAVE APPROVE A DOCTOR BEING ON  TV EITHER?
NO. Stephen: IS THERE AN AFTER  RISK ON ME.
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE AN  AFTER RISK ON ME. WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING FROM A  DOCTOR ON TELEVISION YOU WANT TO  TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHY ARE THEY SAYING THAT? IS THERE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE?
Stephen: WHY ARE THEY? OMETIMES THEY'RE TRYING TO  SELL YOU SOMETHING OR TRYING TO  EXPLAIN SOMETHING.
Stephen: IF THEY'RE TRYING TO  SELL ME SOMETHING, SHOULD I  TRUST HEM?
I'D BE VERY CAREFUL. Stephen: OKAY. I ASSUME YOU ARE GIVING THIS  BOOK AWAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
FOR YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU A  COPY.
Stephen: SO I SHOULD TRUST  YOU BUT NOBODY ELSE.
EXACTLY. Stephen: RICHARD, THANK YOU  SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Stephen: DR. RICHARD BESSER. TRUT HIM. TELL ME THE TRUTH, DOCTOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
