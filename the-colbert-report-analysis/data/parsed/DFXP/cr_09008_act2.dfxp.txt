STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. FOR TWO YEARS MITT ROMNEY HAS  BEEN A SEVERE CONSERVATIVE. BUT LAST WEEK HE MOVED TO THE  CENTER IN HIS VICTORIOUS DEBATE. SO WHICH IS THE REAL MITT  ROMNEY? A MYSTERY THIS DEEP REQUIRES A  MAN WHO REALLY KNOWS THE MEANING  OF "TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE."  ME, STEPHEN COLBERT! THIS IS FORMIDABLE OPPONENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪ [BELL RINGING]
STEPHEN, THANK YOU FOR  JOINING ME.
WELL, I'LL GO ON ANY SHOW TO  PROMOTE MY NEW BOOK "AMERICA  AGAIN, REBECOMING THE GREATNESS  WE NEVER WEREN'T." [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT WEEK, I'M GUEST-HOSTING  "HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO."  'CUZ A DOLLAH MAKES ME HOLLAH! [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, I'D NEVER STOOP THAT  LOW MYSELF, BUT I'VE GOT TO  ADMIRE SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION.
OH NO-- THERE'S SOME SHAME. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'D LOVE AN AUTOGRAPHED COPY.
YOU BET:  OKAY. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. TO STEPHEN, YOU COMPLETE ME. STEPHEN. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
OKAY, STEPHEN, VOTERS RESPOND  TO AUTHENTICITY. SO MITT'S CLEAR VICTORY IN THE  1ST DEBATE PROVES HIS NEW  MODERATE VALUES ARE THE REAL  ONES.
YOU ARE ADORABLE. WHO GOT SUCKED IN BY ROMNEY? WHO GOT SUCKED IN? YOU DID!
NO, I DIDN'T.
YES, YOU DID!
KNOCK IT OFF.
WHO DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN I  TALK LIKE THIS? YOU DON'T!
HEY, IF ANYONE "FELL FOR IT,"  IT'S YOU HARD LINERS WHEN YOU  NOMINATED MITT. FOR PETE'S SAKE, HE GAVE US  ROMNEYCARE. THE INSPIRATION FOR OBAMACARE!
WHICH HE WILL REPEAL AND  REPLACE!
WITH MORE ROMNEYCARE!
WHICH HE LEAVES THAT UP TO  INDIVIDUAL STATES! AND I'M SURE MISSISSIPPI WILL  STEP RIGHT UP TO THE PLATE. [ LAUGHTER ]
HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR THE  MIDDLE CLASS.
HE'S PROMISING A 20% TAX CUT  FOR THE TOP 1%.
HE'S ALSO PROMISING TO CLOSE  THEIR TAX LOOP HOLES, SO THEY'LL  STILL PAY THE SAME AMOUNT.
THEN WHY CUT THEIR TAXES? [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW A GUY  CAN CHANGE HIS BELIEFS OVERNIGHT  AND STILL COME OFF AS CREDITABLE  IN A DEBATE.
OH, IT'S EASY. HERE, LET'S SWITCH SIDES.
UHH...OK. [ LAUGHTER ]
SO NOW YOU'RE ME. AND I'LL PRETEND TO BE YOU. I HAVE POSTULATED THE THEORY  MITT ROMNEY IS A SECRET CENTRIST  PRETENDING TO BE A CONSERVATIVE  POSING AS A MODERATE. IPSO FACTO, I YIELD THE FLOOR. -- I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY  TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW YOU DO ME.
MYAH, SEE, MYAHH. I KNOW THAT ROMNEY'S  EMBRACE OF  MODERATION IS MERELY A COVER FOR  ACTUALLY BEING THE ULTRA  CONSERVATIVE HE WAS IN THE  PRIMARIES. MYAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
WOW, I DO A GREAT DE NIRO. [ LAUGHTER ]
YES, YOU DO.
WELL, STEPHEN I AGREE WITH  WHAT YOU JUST SAID. ROMNEY'S A SECRET CONSERVATIVE. YOU WIN.
WAIT. BUT I WAS BEING YOU WHEN I SAID  THAT, SO I LOSE.
DOES IT REALLY MATTER WHO  WON, AS LONG AS I DID? [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, LET'S SWITCH BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU TRIPPED ME.
SORRY.
WELL, LET'S SWITCH SIDES.
NO, WE JUST DID.
I DON'T THINK SO.
NO, WE TOTALLY DID. ANYWAY, THANKS AGAIN FOR THE  BOOK.
WAIT, YOU GAVE ME THE BOOK. YOU EVEN SIGNED IT FOR ME.
NO YOU SIGNED IT FOR ME. "TO STEPHEN. I COMPLETE YOU."
OH, MY GOD. I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND WE ONLY SWITCHED  POSITIONS ONCE.
IMAGINE HOW MITT ROMNEY MUST  FEEL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I BET PRETTY GOOD, BECAUSE  IT'S WORKING. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU'VE GOT A POINT.
AND YOU SIR, ARE--
A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
