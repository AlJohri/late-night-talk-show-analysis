[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK SHALL  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER  GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY WHO NOW  -- AND A CURRENT GUEST ON MY SHOW  PLEASE WELCOME, JIM McGREEVEY.
PLEASURE.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. I DO STILL CALL YOU GOVERNOR.
JIM IS GOOD.
Stephen: GOV JIM THANKS FOR  COMING ON, YOU KNOW?  I DIDN'T  KNOW WHETHER I WOULD EVER HAVE YOU ON MY SHOW BECAUSE YOU HAD A  SPECTACULAR FALL, OKAY?
YES.
Stephen: YOU WERE THE  GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY 2004. YOU CAME OUT AND SAID I AM A GAY  AMERICAN ON LIVE TV, SHOCKED A  TON OF PEOPLE. NOW YOU ARE THE SUBJECT OF A NEW  DOCUMENTARY CALLED "FALL TO  GRACE."  ON HEEBO. WE'LL GET TO THE NAME IN A  MOMENT. HBO, ARE THERE DRAGONS IN THIS?
LIMITED.
Stephen: ANY DRAGONS WILL  DO. WHY "FALL TO GRACE."  IT'S FALL FROM GRACE. YOU HAD A FALL FROM GRACE. YOU WERE A POWERFUL MAN IN A  NORMATIVE RELATIONSHIP, SORRY  AND SUDDENLY YOU WEREN'T AND YOU  AREN'T.
I THINK THE BASIS OF THE  TITLE IS THAT I WAS IN A PLACE  OF EGOS, A PLACE OF SELF.
Stephen: OF COURSE, YOU  WERE IN POLITICS.
EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND NOW I'M IN A PLACE WHERE  HOPEFULLY I'M BEING OF SERVICE  TO THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I WORK.
Stephen: THAT'S THE THING. YOU ARE WORKING WITH FEMALE  PRISONERS IN JAILS -- PRISONS IN  YOUR HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU DOING  FOR THESE PEOPLE?
STEPHEN ABOUT 70% OF PEOPLE  IN JAIL OR IN PRISON ARE  ADDICTS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO  PROVIDE TREATMENT SO THAT THEY  BEGIN TREATMENT WHILE THEY ARE BEHIND BARS AND THEY CONTINUE  THAT TREATMENT WHEN THEY GET  OUT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU KNOW  ABOUT PRISON? DID YOU GO TO JAIL?
NO, NO. I USED TO BE A PROSECUTOR.
Stephen: TO YOU PUT A LOT  OF PEOPLE IN JAIL.
THAT WAS THE GOAL.
Stephen: DO THESE WOMEN  THAT YOU ARE THE GUY WHO DIDN'T  PARDON THEM?
THEY PROBABLY DO. THEY ALSO KNOW I'M THE GUY WHEN  RESIGNED. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT WE CAN  RECLAIM ALL OF THESE WOMENS'  LIVES. I WORK WITH THEM SPIRITUALLY AND  TRY TO DEVELOP A SET OF VALUES  IN THEIR LIVES.
Stephen: IS THIS A  CHRISTIAN THING?
IT'S A SPIRITUAL THING.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HAVE  AGAINST CHRISTIANS?
HAIP TO BE ONE BUT IT'S ALL  ABOUT -- JUDAISM, ISLAM, IT'S  CHRISTIANITY, HINDUISM IT'S ALL UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE TO  FOLLOW OUR GODLY NATURE.
Stephen: BUT JESUS SAID  VISIT THE PEOPLE IN THE JAICIALG  RIGHT?
HE DID.
Stephen: YOU SAID VISIT THE  PEOPLE IN THE JAIL YOU ARE  VISITING ME. DID YOU EVER SEE THE WOMEN AND  THEY SAY YOU ARE MY JESUS?
IN MANY CASES I BELIEVE THEY  ARE AS GOOD AS WHAT JESUS MEANT  FOR US TO BE.
Stephen: WHAT? YOU ARE SAYING JESUS SAY  CRIMINAL? JESUS IS AN ADDICT? YOUR WORDS, SIR.
HE CLEARLY WAS A CRIMINAL TO  THE ROMAN AUTHORITIES.
Stephen: SURE, SURE THAT  WAS ROME THOUGH. ARE YOU SAYING AMERICANS ARE  ROMANS?
NO, I'M SAYING WE HAVE THE  WRONG ATTITUDE TOWARDS  INCARCERATED PEOPLE. I WOULD SUGGEST IF 70% OF THE  PEOPLE BEHIND BARS ARE ADDICTS  WE WOULD DO FAR BETTER OFF FOR TREATING THEM FOR ADDICTION WHEN  WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF CRIMINAL  BEHAVIOR AS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING THEM TO LANGUISH BEHIND BARS  STREENCH THREE STRIKE YOUR OUT. DON'T LISTEN TO THIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] , MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE  ADDICTS IN THE AUDIENCE. YOU WERE TOUGH ON CRIME.
THAT WAS ME. AND NOW, HOPEFULLY I'M EDUCATED  BY VIRTUE OF HAVING WORKED WITH  THESE WOMEN AND REALIZE THAT THEY STARTED FROM A VERY  DIFFERENT PLACE THAN I DID.
Stephen: DID YOU THINK  ABOUT GUYS LIKE DAVID VITTER.
YES.
Stephen: OR BILL CLINTON.
YES.
Stephen: WHO HAD  HETEROSEXUAL SCANDALS AND  MAINTAINED THEIR POLITICAL  CAREER AND YET YOU HAD A HOMOSEXUAL AND COULDN'T MAINTAIN  YOUR CAREER. IS THE NEW GAY RIGHTS STRUGGLE  THE RIGHT TO HAVE A GAY SCANDAL  AND REMAIN IN POLITICS?
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ON  THE EDGE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS --  I DON'T THINK IT'S A PRY MAURY CONCERN RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: JIM, WE'RE GOING  TO GET THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH  JIM McGREEVEY, "FALL TO GRACE"  IS CURRENTLY AIRING ON HBO. CHEC
