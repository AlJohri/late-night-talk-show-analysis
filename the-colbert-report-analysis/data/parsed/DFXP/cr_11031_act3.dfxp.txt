[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY ANY GUEST TONIGHT IS DIRECTOR OF "INTERSTELLAR" "INCEPTION" AND "MEMENTO." I'LL ASK HIM TO EXPLAIN THIS INTERVIEW TO ME PLEASE WELCOME CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: MR. NOLAN, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON. I'M A BIG FAN.
THANK YOU. Stephen: BUT I DO HAVE A BEEF WITH YOU.
OH? Stephen: UH-HUH I CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU'RE SMART OR WHETHER YOU'RE JUST ENGLISH. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: AMERICANS CAN'T HEAR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE. ARE YOU A SMART GUY?
I'M A -- I'M CERTAINLY ENGLISH. I WOULDN'T CLAIM TO ANYMORE SMARTS THAN ANYONE ELSE.
Stephen: WELL YOUR MOVIES ARE SMART MOVIES. OKAY. I DON'T ALWAYS GET THEM. I DON'T GET THEM, I LOVE THEM. THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE WITH YOU. YOUR MOVIES ARE MASSIVELY ENTERTAINING. MOMENTO, INTERSTELLAR, ALL THEM BATMAN FILMS YOU DO. OKAY. AND NOW INTERSTELLAR. IT'S A SPACE EPIC YOU KNOW, BUT ALSO  WHEN THE MOVIE IS OVER I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT THE MOVIE. LIKE, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY DIDN'T MAKE ME DO THAT. WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE ME THINK? WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY CAN'T YOU JUST HAVE [BEEP] BLOW UP?
WELL, I THINK YOU CAN HAVE BOTH A FILM THAT MAKES PEOPLE  THINK AND BLOW [BEEP] UP.
Stephen: YOU BLOW UP [BEEP] REALLY GOOD, DON'T GET ME WRONG
DON'T DO ME DOWN ON BLOWING UP THE [BEEP]. I HAVE BLOWN UP A LOT OF [BEEP] IN A LOT OF MOVIES. I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH. I LOVE MOVIES THAT ARE VERY ENTERTAINING. HOPEFULLY THE  FIRST TIME YOU SEE IT, YOU'RE ON A REAL RIDE "INTERSTELLAR" IS MEANT TO BE AN EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: BLEW MY MIND.
IF THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT AND IT RATTLES AROUND IN YOU AFTERWARDS, MAYBE YOU WILL COME BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN AND FIND MORE IN IT.
Stephen: THERE IS A GUY IN MY HEAD ON A BOOKSHELF  BANGING AWAY RIGHT NOW
NO SPOILERS
Stephen: NO SPOILERS. FOR INSTANCE I'M NOT GONNA SAY WHO  THE DOCTOR IS ON THE PLANET THEY GO TO. IT'S MARTIN LAWRENCE. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: DRESSED AS BIG MAMA FANTASTIC. INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE. OKAY. SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS "INTERSTELLAR THING" THIS IS I BELIEVE A TROJAN HORSE FOR SCIENCE. THE WHOLE POINT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENS. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT AND DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE TRAVELING OUT IN SPACE TO FIND A NEW HOME, RIGHT?
IT IS. IT'S ABOUT ABOUT A POTENTIAL MOMENT IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. MAYBE THE NEXT STEP IN HUMAN EVOLUTION.
Stephen: EARTH IS IN BAD SHAPE IN THE MOVIE.
YES THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PLANET TO SUSTAIN HUMAN LIFE.
Stephen: THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION HERE. THE MOST HOPEFUL THING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE IS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ABANDON OUR PLANET. [LAUGHING]
Stephen: THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. WE MAY SCRAPE THE DIRT OF THIS THING OFF OF OUR BOOTS AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. HAVE YOU GIVEN UP ON THE EARTH.
I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON THE EARTH.
Stephen: YOUR HEROES DO.
MY HEROES DO? IT'S NOT THE QUESTION OF GIVING UP ON THE EARTH AS MUCH AS HAVING FAITH IN HUMANITY. THE OPTIMISM IN  THE FILM IS PERHAPS HUMANITY MAY NEED YOU IN THE FUTURE OR  IS CAPABLE OF EXISTING INDEPENDENTLY OF THE EARTH. MAY HAVE A GREATER PLACE OUT THERE IN THE UNIVERSE. THE UNIVERSE IS AN INCREDIBLY  VAST PLACE.
Stephen: IT'S BIG TOO. REALLY BIG.
IT'S VERY BIG. Stephen: YES.
MAYBE THERE ARE OTHER PLACES FOR US TO LIVE.
Stephen: IS IT GLOBAL WARMING OR CLIMATE CHANGE? WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE EARTH HERE?
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS AGRICULTURAL BLIGHT. Stephen: AGRICULTURAL BLIGHT?
YES CROPS ARE DYING. CORN IS ALL THAT'S LEFT.
Stephen: WHAT ELSE IS THERE? I JUST NEED MY CORN CHIPS AND HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LIVING ON AND MAKING A LIFE AND ADAPTING AS HUMANS DO. THAT'S COMING TO AN END. YOU KNOW WE BASE THE END OF THE WORLD SCENARIO ON THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. PEOPLE ARE GIVING TESTIMONIALS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW. THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE. WE DREW IT FROM KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARY ON THE DUST BOWL. THAT'S A SCIENCE FICTION FILM BUT I WANTED THE FEELING OF DREAD AND IMBALANCE TO THE PLANET TO BE REAL AND CREDIBLE.
Stephen: WHAT ELSE CAN WE SAY WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY. THERE ARE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS IN THE MOVIE. THE MOVIE, I HAVEN'T SEEN A MOVIE LIKE THIS BEFORE. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE CLIP HERE. THIS'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF  THE PART THAT IS THE BLOW UP PART. THE PART THAT IS THE BLOW UP PART.
COOPER THERE IS NO POINT IN USING OUR FUEL TO--
ANALYZE THE ENDURANCE.
COOPER WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DOCKING. Stephen: WOW. HOW HARD WAS IT TO KEEP MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY -- [ APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: -- EXCITING MOMENT WAS IT HARD TO GET HIM TO KEEP HIS SHIRT ON?
NOT IN SPACE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: I'M SORRY.
HAVING A GOOD TIME? GOOD TIME? THAT'S GREAT.  Stephen: THANK YOU, AMY. THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LAST QUESTION. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY IN THE MOVIE. ARE WE HAPPENING NOW OR IS THIS WATCHING OURSELVES IN THE PAST? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. DO YOU BELIEVE ALL TIME IS HAPPENING AT ONCE?
I BELIEVE IF YOU ARE CAPABLE OF LIVING IN A FIVE-DIMENSIONAL WORLD AND YOU'RE A FIFTH DIMENSIONAL CREATURE VIEWING TIME AS A DIMENSION IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REWRITTEN.
Stephen: YOU DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION. TELL YOU WHAT, COME AGAIN IN JANUARY AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT. CHRISTOPHER NOLAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. CHRISTOPHER NOLAN "INTERSTELLAR" IN THEATERS NOW. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
