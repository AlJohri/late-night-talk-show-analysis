[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stephen: WELCOME BACK,  EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE AUTHOR  OF A NEW YORKER ARTICLE CALLED  "SLOW IDEAS."  IN A MONTH I'M GOING TO KNOW WHAT I THINK OF IT. PLEASE WELCOME ATUL GAWANDE. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS.
NOT THAT LONG  Stephen: WHAT? IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE. YOU CAME HERE TO TELL US ABOUT  CHECKLISTS AND HOW THEY CAN MAKE  OUR LIVES A BETTER PLACE, KEEP DOCTORS FROM KILLING PEOPLE,  LEAVING SPONGES IN PATIENTS AND  STUFF LIKE THAT. YOU STILL USE A CHECKLIST?
YES  Stephen: ME TOO. TONIGHT I'M CHECKING OFF  DR. ATUL GAWANDE. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW  YOU'RE A SURGEON, YOU'RE A  PROFESSOR AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF  PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU ALSO WRITE FOR THE NEW  YORKER. YOU'VE GOT A NEW ARTICLE CALLED  "SLOW IDEAS: SOME INNOVATIONS  SPREAD FAST. HOW DO YOU SPEED THE ONES THAT  DON'T?"  HERE'S ONE IDEA OF HOW TO SPEED  THINGS UP. SHORTER TITLES. IDEAS GET RIGHT ACROSS, OKAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IF AN IDEA IS GOOD, WON'T IT  NATURALLY JUST SPREAD FAST?
YOU WOULD THINK SO. Stephen: I DO. 19th CENTURY I STARTED  WITH LOTS OF IDEAS BUT TWO. ONE IS THE IDEA OF DISCOVERY OF  ANESTHESIA, FREEDOM FROM PAIN  DURING SURGERY
Stephen: LIKE ETHER OR COLOR  FORM.
EXACTLY. RIGHT AROUND THAT SAME THING,  ANT SEPTICS, LISTER SHOWING THE  WAY TO STOP INFECTIONS
Stephen: SPRAYING LISTERINE  AROUND THE ROOM.
ANESTHESIA SPREAD IN WEEKS ON  TO EVERY CAPITAL AROUND EUROPE. IT WAS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES  IN EVERY HOSPITAL IN SEVEN YEARS
Stephen: NOBODY WANTS TO BE  IN PAIN.
YOU DON'T WANT INFECTION  Stephen: BUT YOU CAN'T SEE  INFECTION.
YOU WANT INSTANT  GRATIFICATION NOT ONLY IF YOU'RE  A PATIENT, YOU'RE FREE FROM  PAIN. BUT IF YOU'RE THE SURGEON YOU  DON'T HAVE A SCREAMING PARITY ON  THE TABLE
Stephen: OR IF YOU'RE A DRUG  ADDICT, YOU CAN POUR IT ON IF  RUG IN YOUR CAR AND BE HIGH AS YOU DRIVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY. I SAW THAT IN A BOOK.
OR IN A HORSE BUGGY IN THE  19th CENTURY
Stephen: SURE. THE ANTISEPTIC WAS LISTERINE  WAS BASEDDED ON CAR BOLIC ACID  WAY WAS THE ANTISEPTIC
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS SCARY. IT BURNED YOUR HAND. YOU LITERALLY NOT ONLY YOU'RE  DELAYING A BUG YOU CAN'T SEE,  GERMS YOU CAN'T SEE, A PROBLEM THAT WON'T APPEAR FOR A FEW DAYS  BUT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH PAIN  IN ORDER TO HAVE IT. THAT IS THE STORY OF MANY SLOW  IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE TO NOT ONLY  DELAY GRATIFICATION. BUT IT'S PAINFUL UP FRONT FOR A  GREAT CONSEQUENCE LATER ON. LIKE SEX.
Stephen: YOUR POINT IS THAT  THESE IDEAS SHOULD BE SLOW?
NO  Stephen: OKAY, GOOD. BECAUSE I WANT IMMEDIATE  GRATIFICATION. I WANT LIKE AN APP ON MY PHONE  THAT I CAN JUST HIT AND GO  WHAT'S A GOOD IDEA? AND IT TELLS ME WHAT THE GOOD  IDEA IS. THEN I ADOPT THAT IDEA AS A GOOD  IDEA AND DON'T HAVE TO PUT ANY  THOUGHT INTO IT.
WE'VE SO OVERVALUED THE IDEA  OF APPs OR INCENTIVES TO GET  PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING, ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE'RE WORKING  WITH IS IN SOME COUNTRIES LIKE  IN INDIA WHERE YOU HAVE DEATHS IN CHILDBIRTH THERE ARE VERY  BASIC THINGS FROM HAND WASHING  TO PUTTING THE BABY DIRECTLY ON TO THE SKIN OF THE MOM TO WARM  THE BABY UP CUTS THE DEATH RATE  BY A THIRD
Stephen: IS IS IT JUST  MEDICINE?
IT'S NOT JUST MEDICINE. IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD THAT WHAT  YOU SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS  IS WHAT THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE FOR CHANGING, WHETHER PEOPLE  CHANGE THEIR NORMS AND STANDARDS  IS NOT WHETHER YOU PAY THEM, NOT WHETHER YOU PENALIZE THEM BUT  WHETHER YOU TALK TO THEM. PEOPLE TALKING TO PEOPLE. THEY KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE  ACTUALLY DOING THIS THEMSELVES. DO YOU TRUST AND KNOW SOMEONE  WHO IS DOING THIS? THEN YOU CHANGE
Stephen: THIS IS HOW GAY  MARRIAGE SPREAD. IT'S BECAUSE THAT WAS A SLOW  IDEA, RIGHT? PEOPLE DID NOT ACCEPT THAT  BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST GOD'S LAW. BUT EVENTUALLY GAY PEOPLE GOT TO  KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE OR SO MANY  PEOPLE GOT TO KNOW GAY PEOPLE THAT EVENTUALLY YOU SAID, WELL,  I'M AGAINST, YOU KNOW, GAY  RIGHTS BUT NOT, YOU KNOW, NOT BRIAN AND ALLEN. THEY SEEM LIKE GOOD GUYS. I'D LOVE THEM TO BE HAPPY  TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW THEY CREPT INTO OUR  HEARTS. RIGHT? THAT'S A SLOW IDEA. ISN'T IT?
AND IT WORKED EXACTLY THE WAY  YOU DESCRIBED. IT WASN'T AN APP OR AN INCENTIVE  PROGRAM. IT WAS PEOPLE TALKING TO PEOPLE  AND MOVING AN IDEA
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT IT'S  GOING TO TAKE FOR ME TO ACCEPT  GLOBAL WARMING. IT ALL HAPPENED UP THERE ON THE  TOP OF THE GLOBE AND I DON'T SEE  IT HAPPEN. VERY THEORETICAL TO ME. BUT IF POLAR BEARS WERE GOING  DOOR TO DOOR, KNOCKING AND  SAYING EXCUSE ME, SIR, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE  GLOBAL WARMING CRISIS? AND ABOUT OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST? I THINK LISTEN. THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO CHANGE MY  MIND. BUT SHORT OF THAT, ISN'T GLOBAL  WARMING A HARD SELL?
YES. HERE IS AN EXACT KIND OF FLOW  IDEA BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO  NOW IS PAINFUL TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, WHETHER IT'S A CARBON  TAX OR CONSERVATION OR ANY OF A  NUMBER OF OPTIONS FOR DEALING WITH GLOBAL WARMING FOR THE  DELAYED GRATIFICATION OF SAVING  THE PLANET
Stephen: NOW YOU WRITE ABOUT  INNOVATION.
YEAH  Stephen: WHY WRITE ABOUT  INNOVATION IN A MAGAZINE?   ( APPLAUSE )   BECAUSE I STILL BELIEVE IN BEING  ABLE TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND BE  ABLE TO CHANGE MINDS
Stephen: LANGUAGE IS THE  ULTIMATE SLOW IDEA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  ME. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] FROM THE NEW YORKER, DR. AHUL  HUL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
