Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IT THE AUTHOR OF A BEST-SELLING BOOK ABOUT KIDS WITH CANCER FALLING IN LOVE. IT'S THE PERFECT SUMMER BEACH WEEP. PLEASE WELCOME JOHN GREEN. HEY, MR. GREEN, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON
MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE
Stephen:  NICE TO MEET YOU. AS YOU CAN TELL,  PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE YOU HERE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR THOSE FEW PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT KNOW, YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF "LOOKING FOR ALASKA," "PAPER TOWNS" AND "THE FAULT IN OUR STARS," WHICH HAS SPENT OVER 130 WEEKS ON "THE NEW YORK TIMES" BESTSELLER LIST AND A MOVIE RELEASED ON JUNE 6th THAT IS KICKING ALL KINDS OF ASS. IT REALLY IS. NOW, I... WHEN I FIRST HEARD "FAULT IN OUR STARS," I ASSUMED IT WAS ABOUT ALIENS WHO COME DOWN TO EARTH WITH SOME SORT OF RAY GUN THAT MAKES TEENAGERS CRY.
YEAH. THAT'S PART OF IT.
Stephen: BUT I HAVE FOUND OUT SINCE THEN IT'S THE STORY OF TWO TEENAGERS WITH CANCER WHO FALL IN LOVE.
YEAH, IT'S THE STORY OF TWO KIDS WHO MEET AT SUPPORT GROUP. THEY FALL IN LOVE. THEY ALSO FALL IN LOVE WITH A BOOK AND THEY WANT TO MEET THE AUTHOR OF THAT BOOK. IT'S STORY OF THEIR COMING TOGETHER AND BEING IN LOVE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BOTH QUITE SICK.
Stephen: HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE IDEA? DID YOU JUST TAKE THE SADDEST THINGS YOU CAN THINK OF AND THEN JUST PUT THEM ON PIECES OF PAPER AND PUT IT IN THE MOST DEPRESSING HAT IMAGINABLE? PULL THEM OUT AND DO IT LIKE MAGNETIC POETRY? WHY MAKE US CRY SO HARD?
WELL, I ALSO MADE MYSELF CRY A LOT. DID YOU CRYING MAKING IT?
OF COURSE. I WOULD GO INTO STARBUCKS AT LIKE 7:30 AND OPEN UP MY COMPUTER AND BEGIN TO WEEP. THEN FOUR HOURS LATER I WOULD CLOSE MY COMPUTER AND GO INTO MY OFFICE. AND I'M SURE THE BARISTAS THOUGHT I WAS BANANAS. I CRIED A LOT WRITING IT. I WAS REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WITH A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED ESTHER, TO WHOM THE BOOK IS DEDICATED. ESTHER DIED OF CANCER IN AUGUST 2010 WHEN SHE WAS 16. A LOT OF THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN A FURIOUS PERIOD OF GRIEF AFTER HER DEATH. SO IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I COULDN'T NOT WRITE. IT IS USUALLY THE MOST FUN KIND OF WRITING, BUT IN THIS CASE IT WAS ALSO THE MOST SAD.
Stephen: WELL, THIS HAS BEEN CALLED A "YOUNG ADULT NOVEL." HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT TERM, "YOUNG ADULT NOVEL" BECAUSE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, A YOUNG ADULT NOVEL IS A REGULAR NOVEL THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN YOU CALL SOMETHING A YOUNG ADULT NOVEL, THERE'S A GHETTOIZATION OF IT
THERE IS IN A WAY BUT THERE'S ALSO THAT CONNOTATION,  OH, I MIGHT LIKE READING IT. I LOVE BEING A POP WRITER. I WANT TO STAY ONE.
Stephen: YOU'RE MORE THAN A POP WRITER. YOU'RE A MULTIMEDIA POP ARTIST BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE VLOG BROTHERS YOU DO WITH YOUR BROTHER. WHAT'S HIS NAME?
HANK.
AND YOU HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL.
JUST ONE PERSON.
Stephen: EXACTLY. I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HANK. NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. OVER 200 MILLION VIEWS. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO ON THE VLOG BROTHERS THAT YOU CAN'T DO IN A BOOK?
WELL, BOOKS TAKE YEARS AND YEARS TO WRITE. IT'S LIKE A REALLY LONG GAME OF MARCO POLO WHERE YOU'RE IN YOUR BASEMENT SAYING MARCO, MARCO, MARCO, MARCO, AND IT'S NOT FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS THAT SOMEONE SAYS OH, POLO.
Stephen: AND YOU DO IT WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED. WHEREAS WITH YOUTUBE AND THE INTERNET, YOU CAN CONNECT TO PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY. YOU CAN ALSO DO BIGGER COMMUNITY PROJECTS. WE HAVE A NON-PROFIT PROJECT CALLED THE PROJECT FOR AWESOME WHERE EVERY DECEMBER WE RAISE MONEY FOR CHARITY, AND WE HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF PROJECTS, BUILDING WELLS IN HAITI AND BANGLADESH, AND THAT'S STUFF BOOKS CAN'T DO.
Stephen: ARE YOU A CULT LEADER? THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REALLY WOULD JUST HURL THEMSELVES OFF A CLIFF FOR YOU IF AT THE BOTTOM THEY COULD DIG A WELL IN HAITI.
I HOPE YOU WON'T MIND IF I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WITH A QUESTION, WHICH IS: ARE YOU A CULT LEADER [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"]
Stephen: TELL YOU WHAT, IF YOU HAVE SOME TIME, COME OUT TO THE COMPOUND THIS WEEKEND. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL SET YOU UP WITH A CHILD BRIDE.
I'VE BEEN ITCHING FOR AN INVITE. I'M SO GRATEFUL.
Stephen: HAVE YOU SEEN THE MOVIE?
YEAH, I'VE SEEN IT DOZENS OF TIMES.
Stephen: REALLY?
I LOVE THE MOVIE. I SNEAK INTO THEATERS AND WATCH IT STILL. IT MAKES ME SAD, I CRY A LOT, BUT IT ALSO FILLS ME UP AND MAKES ME JOYFUL TO WATCH OTHER PEOPLE CRY AT SOMETHING I MADE. [LAUGHTER]
Stephen: CAN YOU NOT AFFORD A TICKET TO A MOVIE? YOU REALLY HAVE TO SNEAK IN?
NO, I PAY. I SNEAK IN AND SIT IN THE BACK ROW.
Stephen: JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. I KNOW NOVELS DON'T PAY WHAT THEY USED TO
NO, IT'S OKAY.
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: JOHN GREEN, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. THE BOOK AND THERE'S A MOVIE.
