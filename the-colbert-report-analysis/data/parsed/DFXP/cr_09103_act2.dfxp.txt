WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, BEFORE THE BREAK, I WAS  TALKING TO WISCONSIN'S FOURTH  DISTRICT CONGRESSWOMAN GWEN  MOORE. AND NOW THE EXCITING MOORE OF  THAT. JIM? LET'S GO BACK TO SOMETHING WE  WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE.
SURE. tephen: YOU WERE ON WELFARE  WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.
I WAS. Stephen: BUT YOU'RE A  CONGRESSWOMAN NOW. YOU'RE STILL GETTING A  GOVERNMENT CHECK. AT WHAT POINT WILL YOU STOP  SUCKALLING AT THE GOVERNMENT  TEAT.
I'LL QUIT SUCKING AT THE  GOVERNMENT TIT AT THE SAME  TIME...
Stephen: I DIDN'T SAY TIT. BUT YOU CAN SAY IT. OKAY. I'M SORRY.
I CAN TELL YOU MY EXPERIENCE  ON WELFARE DID NOT PREPARE ME TO  BE ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES  COMMITTEE.
Stephen: BECAUSE ON THE  FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE YOU  HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE. WELFARE IS FREE MONEY. KA-CHINK. LAID BACK. GOT MY MIND ON MY MONEY AND MY  MONEY ON EYE MIND.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I AM  GRATEFUL TO THE CITIZENSATE... CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES  WHO THOUGHT I WAS WORTH.
Stephen: YOU'RE GRATEFUL. YOU'RE WELCOME BY THE WAY.
I AM GRATEFUL TO PEOPLE WHO  THOUGHT THAT I WAS WORTH IT.
Stephen: WOULD YOU LIKE TO  THANK ME FOR THE MONEY I GAVE  YOU.
I WAS GRATEFUL FOR THE  EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT  I'VE HAD THROUGH THE TAX PAYERS.
Stephen: THANK YOU, STEPHEN. THANKS, STEPHEN. Stephen: GREAT. FOR PAYING PROPERTY TAXES SO  I COULD GO TO SCHOOL. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE ALL  OWE EACH OTHER.
Stephen: LET'S AGREE TO  DISAGREE.
OKAY. Stephen: WISCONSIN GOVERNOR  SCOTT WALKER, GREAT GOVERNOR OR  THE GREATEST GOVERNOR?
I KNOW SCOTT WALKER VERY  WELL. I'VE BEEN KNOWING HIM SINCE HE  WAS A REALLY YOUNG MAN.
Stephen: FRIEND OF HIS? I'VE KNOWN HIM A LONG TIME. Stephen: GOOD FRIEND? I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD  CALL HIM A FRIEND BUT HE'S AN  ACQUAINTANCE. HIS WIFE I THINK AND HIS  CHILDREN ARE WONDERFUL. HIS PARENTS, HIS PARENTS...
Stephen: HIS PARENTS ARE  GREAT. HIS WIFE IS GREAT. HIS KIDS ARE GREAT AND HE IS  ALSO GREAT?
HE'S THE GOVERNOR. Stephen: GREAT OR GREATEST? GREAT IN ONE SENSE. I THINK...
Stephen: REALLY GREAT? GOOD AT HIS JOB?
NO. Stephen: GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE  OF WISCONSIN.
I THINK HE HAS THROWN ELDERLY  UNDER THE BUS, CHILDREN UNDER  THE BUS. WOMEN UNDER THE BUS.
Stephen: THAT'S A METAPHOR,  RIGHT?
TEACHERS UNDER THE BUS. Stephen: HAS HE LITERALLY  THROWN PEOPLE UNDER THE BUS.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY  METAPHOR, LET ME SAY.
Stephen: I WANT TO KNOW IF IT  A METAPHOR BECAUSE YOU'RE  ALARMING ME.
THE DISADVANTAGED, THE  DISABLED, CHILDREN, ELDERLY,  STUDENTS, WORKERS.
Stephen: DIDN'T PUSH THEM  UNDER A BUS LITERALLY?
HE DISADVANTAGED THEM  ECONOMICALLY.
Stephen: I'LL PUT YOU DOWN  FOR GREAT. HARLEY DAVIDSON. DO YOU RIDE?
I HAVE SAT ON A HARLEY AND  TAKEN PICTURES. I'VE FANTASIZED AND IMAGINED  MYSELF DOING IT. YOU'RE A CONGRESSWOMAN RIDING  WITH A MAN. LET'S JUMP THE RAVINE.
OH, MY GOD. Stephen: ARE YOU OKAY, BABY? WHY DID YOU RUN FROM THE  COPS?
Stephen: BECAUSE I'M ON  PROBATION.
WHY DID YOU SHOOT AT THEM. Stephen: BECAUSE I'M CARRYING  WEED.
I TRUSTED YOU. Stephen: YOU KNEW WHAT THIS  LIFE WAS LIKE WHEN WE GOT INTO  THIS RELATIONSHIP. YOU SAID, SPIDER, I'M ALL IN. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE A  DANGEROUS MAN. BUT FROM A CONGRESSWOMAN WHO IS  SOMETIMES A BLACK WOMAN, I LIKE  DANGER. THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS. YOU BETRAYED ME. I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD GO OUR  SEPARATE WAYS.
I THINK SO TOO. BUT IT WAS OKAY UNTIL IT WASN'T  OKAY.
Stephen: CONGRESSWOMAN MOORE,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO  ME TODAY.
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. Stephen: LET'S PUT  WISCONSIN'S FOURTH UP ON THE BIG  BOARD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). LOOK, IT'S THE SECOND COMING OF  LIBERACE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
