WELCOME STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Stephen: WOOO! THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THAT'S NICE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU! THANKS FOR BEING HERE. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND I AM JACKED WITH JACKED! ANTICIPATION BECAUSE TONIGHT, MAYBE STILL GOING ON DURING THIS BROADCAST, IS THE FIFTH REPUBLICAN DEBATE. THIS IS BIG. THIS IS VERY BIG. IT'S BEING TOUTED AS THE LAST G.O.P. DEBATE BEFORE ALL THE OTHERS THAT WILL HAPPEN LATER. AND C.N.N. HAS PULLED OUT ALL THE STOPS TO PROMOTE IT WITH AN EXCITING BUT SOMEWHAT FRIGHTENING AD: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. THE LAST FEW WERE NOT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THEY'RE FROM "THE WALKING DEAD," WHICH FOR ONCE DOES NOT MEAN JEB BUSH'S CAMPAIGN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DIDN'T REALIZE-- I DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAD SO MANY JEB FANS TONIGHT. SPEAKING OF JEB, AMERICA'S FOURTH FAVORITE BUSH-- AFTER GEORGE, THE OTHER GEORGE, AND OF COURSE, THE BAKED BEANS-- HE HAS SENT AN E-MAIL TO HIS SUPPORTERS-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- PROMISING THAT AS AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT, IF YOU GIVE HIM $25, YOU WON'T RECEIVE ANY MORE E-AIL REQUESTS FOR CASH THE REST OF THE YEAR. IT'S A POLITICAL STRATEGY BORROWS FROM THE MOB: "HEY, THIS IS A REAL NICE INBOX YOU GOT HERE. I WOULD HATE TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN TO IT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. GIMME $25, AND THAT PROBLEM GOES AWAY. I'M JEBY THE KNUCKLES, AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, ANYWAY, I AM DEFINITELY WATCHING THE DEBATE TONIGHT, AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE CANDIDATES TOMORROW, UNLIKE CNN, WHO DIDN'T EVEN NAME THE LAST FIVE CANDIDATES IN THEIR AD. TRUMP, CARSON, RUBIO, CRUZ, BUSH AND THE REST, HERE ON C.N.N.'S ISLE! BUT THAT'S TOMORROW,  BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FIRST, I'M SITTING DOWN WITH ACCLAIMED FILMMAKER QUENTIN TARANTINO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HIS NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THE HATEFUL EIGHT." THAT'S THE UNITED STATES TITLE. IN EUROPE IT'S CALLED "A ROYALE WITH CHEESE." I'LL ALSO BE TALKING WITH THE TONY AND GRAMMY-NOMINATED JONATHAN GROFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE STARS IN THE HIT BROADWAY SHOW "HAMILTON." IT IS THE MOST EXCITING THING TO HAPPEN TO BROADWAY SINCE A TOPLESS PAINTED LADY PUNCHED A RACIST ELMO. AND WE'LL ALSO HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM THE GREAT BRITISH BAND SQUEEZE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOVE THEM. THEY'VE WRITTEN SO MANY POP CLASSICS LIKE "TEMPTED BY THE FRUIT OF ANOTHER," WHICH IS JUST A VERY ENGLISH WAY OF SAYING, "I'M DOWN WITH O.P.P." OH, THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. SAY HI, FOLKS. THEY'RE ABOUT TO JINGLE YOUR SLEIGH BELLS. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: A CANADIAN COMPANY THAT SELLS BOTTLES OF FRESH AIR IS SELLING OUT OF THEIR PRODUCT IN CHINA. IF ONLY THEY COULD FIND A PLACE THAT MANUFACTURES CHEAP BOTTLES.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES QUENTIN TARANTINO. ACTOR JONATHAN GROFF. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY SQUEEZE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. HOW ARE YOU ALL DOING? YOU FEELING OKAY TONIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I AM ALSO FINE. FOLKS, WE REALLY LOVE DOING THIS SHOW, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IS THAT IN THE THREE MONTHS WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF BIG GUESTS, BUT WE'VE ALSO DISTINGUISHED OURSELVES BY INTRODUCING SOME GREAT BUT LESSER KNOWN PROJECTS. FOR INSTANCE-- AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS LITTLE MOVIE COMING OUT CALLED "STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I JUST WANT TO DO MY PART TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT IT. THE "STAR WARS" PEOPLE ARE CERTAINLY DOING THEIR PART. THERE ARE TIE-INS TO THE MOVIE EVERYWHERE: "STAR WARS" LIPSTICK, "STAR WARS" LUGGAGE, "STAR WARS" MUSCLE CARS, "STAR WARS" ORANGES. I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY WORK THOSE INTO THE MOVIE. I'M THINKING MAYBE THE NEW DEATH STAR? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO SPOIL THIS MOVIE FOR ME. THE WHOLE GANG IS COMING BACK. CARRIE FISHER ADD LEIA. BEST OF ALL, HARRISON FORD IS REPRIZING HIS ROLE AS HAWN SOLO. THERE HE IS THERE IS HE IS, APPARENTLY COSPLAYING AS DOROTHY HAMILL. FOR FANS LIKE ME, HAN SOLO IS THE GREATEST. WITHOUT HIM, ALL THE KIDS WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS. HARRISON FORD COMING BACK ALMOST DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND I KNOW BECAUSE I OBTAINED EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL MEETING WHERE J.J. ABRAMS SOMEHOW CONVINCED HARRISON FORD TO REPRIZE THE ROLE OF HAN. BOTH BOTHANS DIED TO BRING US THIS FOOTAGE. JIM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HARRISON. HEY.
HI.
J.J.
J.J.
YEAH, YOU DON'T-- REMEMBER ME?
JAY!
YEAH, J.J., HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD, I--
I WROTE--

I WROTE "REGARDING HENRY." REMEMBER THE MOVIE WE DID.
OH, MY GOD!

OH, WOW, THAT'S GREAT. A STEP UP. THAT'S GREAT FOR YOU.
JAY--
J.J.
J.J.
YEAH.
LISTEN, I'M MEETING A GUY.
YEAH, YOU'RE MEETING ME. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE.
WHAT'S THE NEW MOVIE?
"STAR WARS."
THE SPACE THING?
YEAH, YEAH, AND I WAS HOPING WE COULD TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, YOU-- YOU COMING BACK AS HAN SOLO.
I DID THAT, MAN. I MEAN, DIIT, WHAT, TWO TIMES, AND I-- I'VE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.
YOU DID IT THREE TIMES. IT WAS--
THREE TIMES. OH!
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT TO, YOU KNOW-- TO COME BACK AND--
I DON'T GO BACK, MAN. I GO FORWARD. >>, OF COURSE, YOU DO, BUT, LAWRENCE CASS AND I ARE WORKING ON THE SCRIPT.
WAIT A SECOND, HE'S THE GUY WHO PUT THE EWOKS-- HE DID THE EWOK THING?
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS HIS IDEA.
I HATED THOSE EWOKS.
HE'S ONE OF THE GREAT WRITERS --
HEY, J.J. HOW ARE YOU, MAN? GOOD TO SEE YOU. I GOT OFF WORK EARLY AND I THOUGHT I WOULD COME OVER AND SAY HI. THIS IS SUPER EXCITING.
THIS ISN'T A GREAT TIME.
OKAY, OKAY. COULD YOU GIVE US A MINUTE--
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
WE'RE HAVING A MEETING.
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! HARRISON FORD! I AM AN ENORMOUS FAN.
SHHH!
I'M SORRY. ( BLEEP ), FORD! WOW!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M HERE FOR A DRINK.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A DRINK?
YOU SAID LET'S GET A DRINK.
YOU KNOW THIS GUY.
YEAH, YEAH.
I'M IN TOWN "CASTING FOR STAR WARS."
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. I'M TALKING WITH HARRISON.
ARE YOU UP FOR A PART?
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.
WHAT IS THIS?
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVEN'T CAST HAN SOLO YET. OOIRK WORKING ON SOME MOVES. I THINK I HAVE IT DOWN. IS IT LIKE THIS, AND LIKE THIS, AND THEN... THANK YOU.
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
DID YOU DO YOUR OWN SOUND EFFECTS, BECAUSE I'M WORKING ON IT.
NO.
PEW! PEW"P" PANG! PEW, PEW!
WOULD YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET INTO CHARACTER HERE.
THIS IS CARRIE FISHER. HOLD ON.
FOR WHAT REASON?
CARRIE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE IN.
J.J. IS LOOKING FOR A HAN SOLO. I'M TRYING TO GET CHARACTER DOWN.
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
DO THAT AGAIN.
HE BLOCKS THE LENS WITH HIS FINGER. LOOK, LOOK!
DO YOU THAT.
ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME?
NO, I WAS JUST-- I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO BE IMPRESSED.
LOOK! LOOK!
WOW.
I DON'T DO THAT!
YES, YOU DO! YOU WAG. I HAVE BEEN TAKING HARRISON FORD VOCAL LESSONS. HOW DOES IT SOUND? IT WASN'T ME. IT WAS THE GUY WITH ONE ARM! HE KILLED MY WIFE. YEAH?
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
CAN YOU SHOW ME HOW TO USE ONE OF THESE?
IS THIS YOUR IDEA TO BRING HIM HERE?
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT, I GUESS I NEED TO CONSIDER MY OPTIONS.
HE NEEDS OPTIONS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT PRESSURE SOHIM FROM DID ME.
IF YOU'RE SAYING NO, I GOTTA--
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MAN IS GOING THROUGH. THINK ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE FOR ONCE, HARRISON FORD. LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT THAT FACE. IT'S DECAYING BEFORE OUR EYES.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT-- THIS IS AN OPTION?
I'VE GOT THE OUTFIT. I'M 90% OF THE WAY THERE.
YOU'RE BRINGING IN A YOUNGER HAN SOLO, RIGHT?
JUST, LIKE, FRESHER.
JUST SOMEONE WILLING TO DO IT.
DO YOU DYE YOUR HAIR? TOUCH IT? COLOR IT OR SOMETHING?
I DON'T DYE MY HAIR.
DON'T, EITHER.
I DON'T DYE MY HAIR, MY FRIEND. AND THE CARPET MATCHES THE CURTAINS. LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT. CAN YOU SAY THE SAME?
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE APARTMENT.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL DEDICATE MY PERFORMANCE TO YOU. I DON'T WANT A CREDIT. I JUST WANT TO SAY, "TO THE MEMORY OF HARRISON FORD."
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "MEMORY OF HARRISON FORD?"
BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD EVER FORGET.
I'M ( BLEEP ) HERE.
LISTEN, STEPHEN, IT'S VERY NICE OF YOU TO BE HERE BUT IT'S NOT VERY RESPECTFUL TO HARRISON.
CAN I PITCH ONE MORE THING?
SURE.
IT'S HAN DUO. HAN AND HIS BROTHER FRAN, AND WE'RE TWINS. AND ONE OF THEM REMEMBERED TO MOISTURIZE.
IT'S HAN SOLO.
BUT THERE ARE TWO OF US NOW.
I WORK ALONE. I DON'T NEED YOU. HE DOESN'T NEED YOU. SEE YOU LATER, JAY.
J.J.
J.J.
IT'S OKAY.
SAY HELLO TO GARY FISHER.
CARRIE.
CARRIE-- GARY. SAY HELLO FOR ME.
ALL RIGHT.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU, TOO.
HEY, HE LEFT HIS PHONE.
GIVE ME THAT! ( APPLAUSE ).
I'LL DO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU WILL? ( APPLAUSE )
WAS THAT OKAY?
THAT WAS GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU GOT IT. SEE YOU LATER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU'RE WELCOME, GALAXY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH QUENTIN TARANTINO. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST IS A TWO-TIME OSCAR-WINNER WHO HAS BEEN CALLED "THE SINGLE MOST INFLUENTIAL DIRECTOR OF HIS GENERATION." HIS LATEST FILM IS "THE HATEFUL EIGHT."
ONE OF THEM FELLAS IS NOT WHAT HE SAYS HE IS.
WHAT IS HE?
IN CAHOOTS WITH THIS ONE, THAT'S WHAT HE IS. ONE OF THEM, MAYBE EVEN TWO OF THEM IS HERE TO SEE DOMERGUE GOES FREE.
ARE YOU SURE YOU AIN'T JUST BEING PARANOID?
OUR BEST BET IS THIS PUPOLICEITOUS FELLA AND HIS COOL CUSTOMER, DAISY HERE, HE WON'T HAVE THE LEATHER PATIENCE IT TAKES TO JUST SIT HERE. HE CAN'T HANDLE IT. HE'LL STOP WAITING, TRY AND CREATE HIS OPPORTUNITY, AND THAT'S WHEN MR. JUMPY REVEALS HIMSELF.
AND WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS?
WHAT I GOT TO SAY? HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME QUENTIN TARANTINO! ♪ CLOWNS TO THE LEFT, JOKERS TO THE RIGHT. ♪ HERE I AM STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, A STANDING "O." NOT SO BAD.
Stephen: THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY NIGHT. THANKS FOR COMING ON. WE HAVE NEVER MET EACH OTHER BEFORE.
I'M REALLY-- I'M A BIG, BIG FAN OF YOURS. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: I'M EXCITED TO MEET YOU, TOO. I'M ALSO A BIG, BIG FAN, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING "RESERVOIR DOGS" YOUR FIRST MOVIE. THOUGH I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU. I HAVE A BIT OF A BEEF. BECAUSE I USED TO REALLY LIKE THE SONG "STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU." AND NOW I CAN'T DO--
YOU ALWAYS SEE MICHAEL MATSON --
DANCING AROUND WITH A MAN'S EAR IN HIS HAND. DO YOU WRITE-- DO YOU WRITE TO MUSIC? I HEARD DO YOU THAT.
YEAH, I DO, ACTUALLY. OFTENTIMES, WHAT I'LL DO IS WHEN I AM THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT STORY COULD POSSIBLY BE, I'LL GO INTO MY RECORD COLLECTION, AND I GO THROUGH THEM ALL, AND THEN I START PLAYING DIFFERENT SONGS --
THIS IS VINYL.
YEAH. I MEAN.
CAN DO CDs, BUT MOSTLY IT'S VINYL. EITHER I'M LOOKING FOR SOME POP SONGS OR I'M LOOKING FOR SOME SOUNDTRACKS, AND THAT'S GOING TO GIVE ME, LIKE, THE BEAT OF THE MOVIE, THE RHYTHM OF THE MOVIE. SAY IN SOMETHING LIKE "JACKIE BROWN." OH, THANKS. I STARTED DIVING THROUGH MY SOUL MUSIC COLLECTION, AND THEN JUST FOUND WHAT WAS EXACTLY-- YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT WOULD BE-- THIS IS THE BEAT OF THE MOVIE. THIS IS THE SOUL OF THE MOVIE THAT I'M USING. AND THAT ACTUALLY HELPS ME ACTUALLY INSPIRES ME TO KIND OF CONDITION FORWARD. AND ANY TIME I'M WRITING AND I NEED A PICK-ME-UP OR NEED TO GET PLUGGED IN AGAIN I'LL PLAY SOME OF THE PIECE OF MUSIC THAT I'M THINKING OF USING IN THE MOVIE AND I'M LITERALLY IN A MOVIE THEATER IN MY HEAD AND I'M SEEING IT ON SCREEN AND I'M SEEING THE SCENES PLAY OUT.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LOVE ABOUT YOUR MOVIES IS WE MIGHT BE ACTUALLY SEEING THE WAY YOU SEE IT IN YOUR HEAD. IT MIGHT BE SELF-EVIDENT, BUT WHAT I MEAN, THAT CLIP RIGHT NOW, AND WHEN I WATCH YOUR MOVIES, IT SEEMS LIKE I'M SEEING SOMETHING CREATED BY SOMEBODY WHO LOVES MOVIES, AND AT NO POINT DOESN'T WANT US TO KNOW THAT IT'S A MOVIE.
YEAH, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE THING ABOUT IT IS SOME PEOPLE, LIKE, DISCUSS THAT OR TALK ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, I HAVE NEVER WATCHED A MOVIE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS WATCHING A MOVIE. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE NEVER READ A BOOK WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS READING A BOOK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: BUT SOME THINGS ARE LIKE, THEY'RE SO MUCH-- THEY'RE SO TRUE, THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WIPE AWAY THE EDGES OF THE FRAME SO YOU DON'T GET A SENSE THAT-- BUT THE STYLISTIC CHOICES YOU MAKE THAT DEFINITELY SAY, "BY THE WAY, LET'S NOT FORGET, WE'RE IN A MOVIE."
THE INTERESTING THING, THERE IS THIS THING YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN TTHAT'S A THEOR I I DON'T THINK IS ACTUALLY A PRACTICE. I ALWAYS KNOW I'M WATCHING A MOVIE. WHEN BRUCE WILLIS ALMOST FALLS DOWN THE AIR SHAFT IN "DIE HARD," FOR A SECOND-- OEVMENT! I WAS LIKE THAT. BUT FOR THE MOST PART I KNEW I WAS WATCHING A MOVIE! ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH, FAIR ENOUGH. DO YOU LIKE ALL KINDS OF MOVIES? OR ARE THERE SOME STYLES YOU DON'T LIKE? DO YOU WOWCH ROM-COMss?
ODDLY ENOUGH, I GUESS THIS MIGHT BE CONFESSIONAL TIME HERE, ROM-COMS ARE KIND OF A GUILTY PLEASURE OF MINE. ESPECIALLY ON AIRPLANES, ESPECIALLY ON AIRPLANES.
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
KATE HUDSON IS THE QUEEN OF THE SKIES, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT WATCHING A ROM-COMMON AN AIRPLANE FLIGHT THAT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO THE FACT THAT I THINK YOU BECOME MORE EMOTIONAL WHEN YOU'RE, LIKE, THREE MILES HIGH IN THE AIR.
Stephen: I THINK IT'S THE LACK OF OXYGEN. ( LAUGHTER ).
I HAVE FOUND MYSELF CRYING, LITERALLY WEEPING AT-- LIKE, THE ONLY-- LIKE EMBARRASSING CONFESSION MOVIES. FOR INSTANCE, I SAW-- I WAS COMING BACK ON A FLIGHT AND I WATCHED THAT MOVIE WITH MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY AND JENNIFER CONNOLLY --
"GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST."
JEFFREY GARDNER. IN THAT MOVIE, HE'S, LIKE, THIS SEXY, FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER, FAMOUS FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER, HAS A TON OF GIRLFRIENDS. HE'S A REAL JERK, AND HE MEETS-- HE'S KNOWN HER FOR A WHILE. BUT THEN IT GOES TO A FLASHBACK WHEN THEY KNEW EACH OTHER WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN, AND THEY'RE SWAY SWING AND IT'S SNOWING AND A PARK. AND SHE GIVES HIM A BIRTHDAY GIFT. AND HE OPENS IT UP, AND IT'S A CAMERA. AND IT ACTUALLY IS LIKE THE EXACT KIND OF THE FIRST CAMERA I WAS EVER GIVEN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I JUST START CRYING. SHE GAVE HIM HIS FIRST CAMERA! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, IS IT THAT MAKE YOU-- DOES THAT MAKE YOU MAD? OR ARE YOU HAPPY? SOMETIMES I'LL FEEL MAD TO BE SUCCESSFULLY MANIPULATED LIKE THAT.
I AM SUCH A FAN OF AUDIENCE ANIPULATION BY FILM MAKERS THAT THAT-- I MEAN, I FEEL THAT'S HALF OF MY JOB AS A DIRECTOR. SO WHILE I MIGHT BE A LITTLE EMBARRASSED ABOUT MENTIONING IT, AT THAT MOMENT, I WAS GENUINELY TOUCHED, AND I WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME SITTING IN A-1 OF FIRST CLASS.
Stephen: I WEPT THROUGH THE-- ( LAUGHTER ) I WEPT THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF "YOU'VE GOT MAIL." THAT'S MY CONFESSION.
I ACTUALLY ONCE HAD, WITH THESE REALLY SERIOUS FILM CRITICS WHO WERE POOH-POOHING "YOU GOT MAIL." AND I HAD A REAL SERIOUS DISCUSSION WITH THEM ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE FILM HAD SOME REAL VERMISSITUDE, EVEN ABOVE THE WHOLE MEG RYAN-TOM HANKS THING. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF HOW BIG CHAIN STORES KILL THE LITTLE STORES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE ONLY HOLLYWOOD MOVIES TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THAT ISN'T A SERIOUS WAY.
Stephen: AT THE END SHE FORGIVES HIM AND ENDS UP BEING RICH WITH THE CHAIN STORE GUY.
THAT'S EXACTLY TROUPE I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ASPECT OF IT.
Stephen: SHE TOTALLY SELLS OUT. SHE TOTALLY SELLS OUT AT THE END. THIS IS A WESTERN. THIS IS A WESTERN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE "THE HATEFUL EIGHT" FOR A SECOND. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE WESTERN OF YOUR OWN?
OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S AN EASY ONE TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S ALSO MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME-- "THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY."
Stephen: AMAZING, AMAZING. INCREDIBLE MOVIE.
BLONDIE! YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE! JUST A DIRTY SON OF A-- WAAAH!
Stephen: INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE. IT'S THREE AND A HALF HOURS LONG. NOW THIS MOVIE, RIGHT NOW, "THE HATEFUL EIGHT" IS DOING A ROAD SHOW FIRST. IT'S IN A FEW CITIES RIGHT NOW AND ON CHRISTMAS DAY IT'S GOING TO GO TO, LIKE, 100 THEATERS. AND IT'S THREE AND A HALF HOURS LONG?
NO, NOT THREE AND A HALF HOURS. IT'S LIKE THREE HOURS-- THE MOVIE ISN'T QUITE THREE HOURS.
Stephen: BUT IT'S GOT AN OVERTURE AND INTERMISSION.
IT WILL BE THREE HOURS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE THEATER BUT THERE'S NOT THREE HOURS OF FILM RUNNING THROUGH THE THE CAMERA IT'S PROJECTOR. BUT THE WHOLE IDEA BEHIND IT, WE HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE ROAD SHOW. THE FILM WAS SHOT IN 70 MILLIMETER --
THAT'S OLD SCHOOL.
YEAH. THIS IS REALLY, REALLY OLD SCHOOL BECAUSE WE SHOT IT WITH THESE LENSES, THE ULTRAPANAVISION 70, AND THEY WERE THE LENSES USED TO SHOOT "BEN HUR," "IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD." WE ARE THE FIRST MOVIE TO USE THESEULENCES THINSs "CARTOOM." WHEN I SAY THE LENSES USED TO SHOOT "BEN HUR." I DON'T MEAN LENSES LIKE THESE. I MEAN THESE LENSES THEMSELVES SHOT "BEN HUR."
Stephen: WOW. THESE LENSES CAPTURED CHARLTON HESTON.
ABSOLUTELY. WHAT HAPPENED IS I HAD AN IDEA IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, LET'S-- LET'S DO IT OLD SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE USED TO BE A THING WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE ROAD SHOWS. THE FILMS WOULD OPEN UP EXCLUSIVELY IN ONE OF THE BIG THEATERS IN THE BIG CITY. AND YOU BOUGHT AN ADVANCED TICKET, AND YOU GOT A PROGRAM, AND YOU GOT DRESSED UP WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO THE MOVIE. AND THEN THERE WOULD BE AN OVERTURE, AND YOU'D SEE THE FILM IN GLORIOUS 70 MILLIMETER, AND THERE WOULD BE AN INTERMISSION. AND IT WAS JUST A BIG NIGHT AT THE-- IT WAS MORE LIKE-- IT WAS MORE LIKE SEE PLACIDO DOMINGO AT THE PARIS OPERA HOUSE THAN JUST GOING TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD MOVIE THEATER.
Stephen: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE PLACIDO DOMINGO IN A WESTERN. I'LL TELL YOU THAT.
HE'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD ACTOR.
Stephen: REALLY?
DOING ALL THOSE-- I SAW HIM ONCE, AND THE OPERA-- OPERA ACTORS ARE ACTORS AND HE WAS ACTUALLY REALLY TERRIFIC IN HIS ROLE.
Stephen: WELL, IT'S ON THE ROAD RIGHT NOW, GOES TO 100 THEATERS ON CHRISTMAS DAY, AND THEN IT OPENS WIDE ON DECEMBER 31.
EXACTLY. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE TO JUST SAY, AND I HAVE TO THANK THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY WHO MADE THE FILM, WHEN WE STARTED THIS THERE WAS ONLY ABOUT, MAYBE, 11 VENUES THAT COULD SHOW 70 MILLIMETER. AND THEY SAID, "I THINK WE CAN COME UP WITH 100." AND THEN-- AND THEY DID. AND WE'VE INSTALLED 70 MILLIMETER PROJECTORS IN CERTAIN THEATERS AND WE CREATED THEATERS DON'T EXIST ACTUALLY. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT THEY CAN'T BELIEVE I'M PART OF, AND I'M JUST REALLY SO PROUD OF IT.
Stephen: AGAIN, YOU SOUND LIKE A GUY WHO LOVES MOVIES.
I AM, I AM.
Stephen: QUENTIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
REALLY GOOD TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, ALSO. "THE HATEFUL EIGHT" ROADSHOW HITS SELECT CITIES CHRISTMAS DAY, AND OPENS NATIONWIDE JANUARY 1ST. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. IT'S NO SECRET THAT AS A LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST, I WIELD TREMENDOUS POWER. I HAVE THE RIGHT OF TALK SHOW PRIMA NOCTA, WHICH MEANS I MAY SLEEP WITH ANY SIDEKICK FROM ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SHOW. HAVE ANDY RICHTER BATHED AND BROUGHT TO MY TENT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT EVEN MY AWESOME POWER PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE GREAT DESPOTS OF HISTORY: GENGHIS KHAN, MUAMMAR QADDAFI, ANGELINA JOLIE. THESE BRUTAL TYRANTS HAVE BUT TWO THINGS IN COMMON: ONE, COMMANDING TOTAL OBEDIENCE. TWO, A BIG FURRY HAT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT THIS HAT IS UPON MY HEAD, I AM ENDOWED WITH UNQUESTIONABLE POWER, DUE TO MY HAT'S TWO MAIN ATTRIBUTES: ITS BIGNESS, AND ITS FURRINESS. ANY PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE WHILST WEARING THE HAT ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN: (DRUMS) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HENCEFORTH, IF STARBUCKS CONTINUES TO INSIST ON USING MADE-UP TERMS FOR SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE, WE GET TO PAY THEM WITH MADE-UP MONEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANYONE WHO PRESSES THE WRONG ELEVATOR BUTTON BY ACCIDENT MUST NOW GET OFF ON THAT FLOOR AND LIVE THERE FOREVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE ARE TOO MANY CABLE DRAMAS. FROM NOW ON, EVERYONE WATCHES ONE SHOW ABOUT A DRUG-DEALING ZOMBIE HACKER HOUSEWIVES WHO ARE NAKED AND AFRAID. THE COUNTING CROWS MUST FINALLY ISSUE A REPORT ON HOW MANY CROWS THERE ARE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NO ONE CAN TELL THAT I AM DRUNK. FROM THIS MOMENT ON, EPISODES OF "SCOOBY DOO" WILL BE REWRITTEN TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT A CRIME TO DRESS UP LIKE A GHOST ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY. STARTING NOW, IF YOU'RE HAPPY AND YOU DON'T KNOW IT, YOU STILL MUST CLAP YOUR HANDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MANHOLES WILL HENCEFORTH BE RE-NAMED "STREET SPHINCTERS." ANYONE WHO TELLS THEIR FRIENDS A STORY FROM SUMMER CAMP SHALL BE PUT IN A CANOE AND ABANDONED IN THE CENTER OF A LAKE. THE PHRASE "IF YOU ASSUME, YOU MAKE AN ASS OUT OF YOU AND ME" WILL HENCEFORTH BE CHANGED TO "IF YOU PRESUME, YOU ARE PUTTING PEE ON YOUR RESUME." ( APPLAUSE ) AIRLINES SHALL STOP EXPLAINING HOW TO BUCKLE OUR SEATBELTS. IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN A CAR, I DON'T WANT YOU ON MY PLANE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN ADDITION, IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THE AIRPLANE ARMREST, I GET TO HOLD YOUR HAND FOR THE ENTIRE FLIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HAIR STYLISTS MAY NO LONGER ASK MEN HOW WE WANT OUR HAIRCUT. WE. DON'T. KNOW. THE HAT HAS SPOKEN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH "HAMILTON"'S JONATHON GROFF. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST BROKE THROUGH ON "GLEE," STARS IN HBO'S "LOOKING," AND NOW PLAYS KING GEORGE ON BROADWAY IN "HAMILTON." PLEASE WELCOME, JONATHAN GROFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVES JONATHAN GROFF.
OH, THAT'S NICE.
Stephen: YOU'RE SO DAMN LOVABLE.
I LOVE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM.
Stephen: IT'S PROBABLY WHY THEY LIKE YOU. PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED WITH "HAMILTON."
YEAH.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU OBSESSED WITH ANYTHING RIGHT NOW?
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD QUESTION.
Stephen: THANK YOU. I DO IT FOR A LIVING. ( LAUGHTER ).
I HAVE A LONG OBSESSION WITH CATE BLANCHETT.
Stephen: OH, COME ON.
I JUST SAW --
GET IN LINE, BROTHER.
SHE'S INCREDIBLE. SHE CAME TO SEE "HAMILTON." AND I WAS SO NERVOUS THAT SHE WAS THERE BECAUSE SHE IS ELIZABETH, HER ELIZABETH IS A LITTLE BIT, LIKE INSPIRATIONAL FOR ME AS THE KING. AND I TOLD HER AFTER THE SHOW-- I WENT ON LIKE A LIST OF THINGS I'D SEEN HER DO. AND I ENDED WITH, "I THINK OF YOU. I THINK OF YOU." AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OKAY."
Stephen: THAT'S A LITTLE SERIAL KILLER.
A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: "I WATCH YOU WHILE YOU SLEEP." SHE WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE, WE HAD HER ON THE SHOW A FEW WEEKS AGO-- YEAH, CAN YOU FEEL IT? CAN YOU FEEL THE GREATNESSs WELLING UP THROUGH YOUR BUTTOCKS RIGHT NOW. FOR ME, SHE'S GLADDIAL FROM "LORD OF THE RINGS" MOVIE.
TOTALLY.
Stephen: SPEAK OF QUEENS, YOU PLAY A FANTASTIC KING GEORGE.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: BECAUSE, I'M JUST SAYING, AND BY "QUEEN" I MEAN YOU SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE FREDDIE MERCURY.
I'LL TAKE IT.
Stephen: A LITTLE FREDDIE MERCURY. A LITTLE ELTON JOHN. IS THERE ANYBODY I'M MISSING IN THE MIX?
THERE'S A LITTLE BEYONCE MIXED IN THERE.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
A LITTLE DAME JUDI DENCH IN THERE.
Stephen: REALLY. AS HER ELIZABETH. SHAKESPEAREAN LOVE?
EXACTLY. I'M ON STAGE FOR NINE MINUTES SO IT'S, LIKE, THE DAME JUDY TRACK FROM "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE."
Stephen: IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU WALKING ON STAGE.
I LOVE WALKING ON STAGE.
Stephen: YOUR ENTRANCE IS A STRAIGHT UP-BACK-- FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THE PLAY YET. YOU'RE KING GEORGE III. EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT YOUR SORT OF COMPLAINT IS DURING THE SHOW.
WELL LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, WHO IS A GENIUS-- ( APPLAUSE ) --
YES, YES.
Stephen: WE JUST HAD HIM HERE IN THE CATE BLANCHETT MEMORIAL SEAT.
I KNOW, IT'S AN HONOR TO BE SITTING HERE, FOR SO MANY REASONS. BUT HE WROTE KIND OF A BREAKUP SONG FOR KING GEORGE. SO IN-- IT'S CALLED "YOU'LL BE BACK," AND IT'S BASICALLY AS THOUGH AMERICA HAS BROKEN UP WITH HIM, AND HE'S, LIKE, REALLY? YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT ME? GOOD LUCK. AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE-- I'M SURE WE CAN ALL RELATE. THOSE PEOPLE WE'VE SORT OF BROKEN UP WITH, WHERE WE THOUGHT WE WERE THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY, AND THEN THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE WITHOUT YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS SORT OF --
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK.
ME, EITHER.
Stephen: NO.
NO SOCIAL MEDIA.
Stephen: AT ALL?
AT ALL.
Stephen: HOW IS THAT? HOW IS THAT?
IT'S NICE.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU NOT DO IT? YOU CAN'T STAND THAT PEOPLE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOU OR SOMETHING?
IT'S MORE THAT I HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE TEXTING PEOPLE BACK. THE IDEA OF RESPONDING TO PEOPLE ON A WALL OR, YOU KNOW, HAVING MORE "ON PHONE" TIME, I'M NOT INTO IT.
Stephen: THAT'S GREAT DISCIPLINE.
THANK YOU.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SPEAKING OF LIKE GEORGE SAYING, "YOU'LL BE BACK," YOU ACTUALLY CAME BACK PUP LEFT THE PLAY FAIR WHILE.
YEAH.
Stephen: TO SHOOT THE MOVIE OF "LOOKING."
YEAH.
Stephen: FOR HBO.
FOR HBO.
Stephen: ONE OF THE STARS OF "LOOKING." THEN YOU CAME BACK A MONTH LATER. WAS IT HARD TO BE AWAY AND JUMP BACK INTO THE SHOW?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK WHEN I CAME BACK BECAUSE I'D NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCEs WAS THE CROWN BROKE WHILE I WAS GONE.
Stephen: GEORGE'S CROWN.
GORGE'S CROWN.
Stephen: DID IT FALL OFF THE UNDERSTUDY'S HEAD?
IT WAS BREAKING WHEN I LEFT AND THERE WAS A NEW CROWN WHEN I GOT BACK AND IT WAS SUCH A REVELATION BECAUSE THE IT WAS POUNDS LIGHTER THAN THE ORIGINAL CROWN. THE ORIGINAL CROWN WAS SO HEAVY IT FORMED MY ENTRANCE WALK ON TO THE STAGE WHICH IS A VERY SPECIFIC SITUATION --
THAT STHA WHY YOU'RE WALKING SO CAREFULLY TO KEEP YOUR NECK FROM SNAPPING?
A LITTLE BIT, YES. IT'S A LITTLE LIKE "I LOVE LUCY" IF I TILT MY HEAD IN ONE DIRECTION I MIGHT FALL OVER.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND BEYONCE LOVES YOUR WALK.
SHE CAME TO SEE THE SHOW WITH JAYZ. I'M OBSESSED WITH BEYONCE.
Stephen: KATE BLANCHET AND BEYONCE TOGETHER IN A ROOM WITH YOU.
I THINK I WOULD IMPLODE, YEAH. BUT SHE CAME TO SEE THE SHOW WITH JAY Z, AND THEY BOTH CAME BACK STAGE AND WERE SO GENEROUS WITH EVERYONE AND VERY SPECIFIC WORDS TO EVERY PERSON IN THE SHOW.
