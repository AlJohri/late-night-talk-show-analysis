I AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT, AND I AM LEGALLY REQUIRED TO TELL YOU I AM WEARING A WIRE RIGHT NOW (LAUGHTER) ANYTHING WE SAY WILL BE RECORDED. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IF I SEEM A LITTLE DISTRACTED TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE DISTRACTED TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING... EVER HEARD OF THE MOVIE "STAR WARS"? IT'S PRETTY GOOD (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU LIKE "STAR WARS"? ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS, THE SHIPS THAT DO THE DIFFERENT THINGS. IT'S INCREDIBLE. EVERYBODY LIKES "STAR WARS." (LAUGHTER) WELL, I'M A HUGE "STAR WARS" FAN. WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD IN 1977, I WON TICKETS TO A PREVIEW OF "STAR WARS" BEFORE IT OPENED NATIONWIDE. SO I KNEW ABOUT "STAR WARS" BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE. I AM A "STAR WARS" FAN. LOOK AT MY PROMPTER RIGHT NOW. YEAH, OKAY? (CHEERING) THAT'S EVERY NIGHT! ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SO... (LAUGHTER) IT'S NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE THAT I WAS PLANNING ON BEING THE FIRST IN LINE IN NEW YORK ON DECEMBER 18 TO SEE THE NEW "STAR WARS." I JUST FOUND OUT -- AND BRACE YOURSELVES -- I FOUND OUT "STAR WARS:  THE FORCE AWAKENS" IS RELEASED ONE DAY EARLIER ON DECEMBER 17 IN ENGLAND! (AUDIENCE REACTS) YEAH... YEAH... BOO! I AGREE, BOO! I'M SORRY. BUT I REFUSE TO GET IN THE BACK OF THE LINE BEHIND PEOPLE WHO CALL IT THE BACK OF THE CUE. HUH-UH! PEOPLE WHO CALL HANS SOLO'S SHIP THE MILLENNIUM LORRY, HUH-UH! SITTING BEHIND THEM IN THE "CINEMA" WITH THEIR WARM BEER AND HORSE TEETH, OR WHATEVER THEY SNACK ON OUT THERE, SO MAD THIS MAKES ME, I SPEAK LIKE YODA I AM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN PISSED I AM OFF! (LAUGHTER) LUCKILY, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL THEM ANYTHING ABOUT THE SHOW AND THEY'RE EXCITED! (LAUGHTER) IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN BETTER BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING WITH THE LOVELY AND TALENTED EMILY BLUNT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL. SHE'S HERE TAKING ABOUT HER NEW MOVIE, "SICARIO," WHERE SHE PLAYS AN F.B.I. AGENT WHO GOES HEAD TO HEAD WITH DRUG CZARS. LIKE "THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA" BUT IN A LESS HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT. (LAUGHTER) SUPREME COURT JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH ME LATER (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HUGE! HUGE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE FULL OF BREYER-HEADS TONIGHT. NORMALLY BREYER SITS NEXT TO CLARENCE THOMAS SO I HOPE HE'S NOT STARTLED WHEN I ACTUALLY TALK. (LAUGHTER) AND WE WILL HAVE MUSIC FROM THE "THE DEAD WEATHER." AS THESE FOLKS KNOW, "THE DEAD WEATHER," A ROCK SUPERGROUP AND CALIFORNIA FORECAST FOR THE NEXT DECADE. SAY HI TO JON BATISTE WITH "STAY HUMAN"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JON --
YEAH.
Stephen: -- DID YOU SEE THE U.S. OPEN FINAL YESTERDAY?
YEAH, YEAH YEAH,... NO.
Stephen: WELL, YOU MISSED IT, BECAUSE IT WAS AN EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN TWO ALL-TIME GREATS, ROGER FEDERER AND NOVAK DJOKOVIC. DJOKOVIC WON IN FOUR GRUELING SETS. I WANT TO OFFER THE CHAMP ANY CONGRATULATIONS. LET'S DO IT NOW. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME NOVAK DJOKOVIC! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CONGRATULATIONS! GOOD DEAL! CONGRATULATIONS! CONGRATULATIONS, CHAMP! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU MUST BE FEELING GREAT. YOU FEEL GOOD?
I FEEL GREAT.
Stephen: GOTTEN SOME REST? ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: AS THE WINNER OF THE U.S. OPEN, WHAT DO YOU GET?
WELL, I GET THIS BEAUTIFUL TROPHY AND WHEN I BRING IT TO THE MOVIE THEATER, I GET FREE REFILLS. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.
ONE OF THE THINGS.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS YOU GET. THERE IS ONE OTHER PRIZE. TELL THE PEOPLE.
WELL, YES. TODAY I GET TO SERVE TENNIS BALLS WITH YOU.
Stephen: YES. YES. TONIGHT, CHAMPION NOVAK DJOKOVIC IS GOING TO FIRE TENNIS BALLS AT ME WHILE I PROTECT MYSELF WITH CAPTAIN AMERICA'S SHIELD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: OKAY. THIS, FOLKS, THIS -- IT'S A TIME-HONORED TRADITION -- IT'S A TIME-HONORED TRADITION DATING BACK FROM A BILLIE JEAN KING SERVED WITH DICK CAVETT, ALL THE WAY BACK WITH ROD LAVER DRILLING WITH ED SULLIVAN. READY?
LET'S GO BACK HERE. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: HOLD ON! NOW, LET'S SET IT UP. LET'S SET UP THE SCENARIO. IN THIS SCENARIO, I'M THE NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA, AND YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN OF HYDRA'S TENNIS TEAM. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HIT THIS?
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: FOR THE RECORD, WHAT'S YOUR TOP SPEED, CHAMP?
130 MILES PER HOUR. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: OKAY, JON BATISTE, COULD WE GET SOME DANGER MUSIC?
OH, YEAH, WE GOT THAT -- ♪
Stephen: OKAY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR BEING YOUR HOST. (CHEERING) AHHH! (CHEERING) ♪ TONIGHT, I WELCOME EMILY BLUNT! SUPREME COURT JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER! MUSICAL GUEST, "THE DEAD WEATHER." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN."

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THAT IS EITHER ONE OF THE NICEST GREETINGS I'VE EVER GOTTEN, OR AM I DREAMING IN A TENNIS BALL-INDUCED COMA RIGHT NOW? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOR ANYONE WONDERING, THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO HEAR A JOKE? (CHEERING) OKAY. HERE WE GO. (KNOCKING) KNOCK, KNOCK.
WHO'S THERE?
Stephen: ORANGE. ORANGE, WHO?
Stephen: SPEAKING OF DONALD TRUMP... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YEAH!
Stephen: THE REPUBLICAN FRONTRUNNER IS NOW RUNNING FRONTER THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE POLLS. NOTHING SEEMS TO STOP THIS MAN DESPITE THE FACT HE'S FACING TOUGH QUESTIONS FINALLY. LIKE THIS ONE FROM UPCOMING CNN DEBATE MODERATOR HUGH HEWITT.
HEWITT:  AT THE DEBATE, I MAY BRING UP NASRALLAH BEING WITH HEZBOLLAH, AND AL-JULANI BEING WITH AL-NUSRA, AND AL-MASRI BEING WITH HAMAS. DO YOU THINK IF I ASK PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THREE THINGS, AND THE DIFFERENCES, THAT THAT'S A GOTCHA QUESTION?
TRUMP: YES, I DO. I TOTALLY DO. I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.
HEWITT:  SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS DOES NOT MATTER TO YOU YET, BUT IT WILL?
TRUMP: IT WILL WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. I WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN YOU KNOW, AND BELIEVE ME, IT WON'T TAKE ME LONG. I WILL KNOW FAR MORE THAN YOU KNOW WITHIN 24 HOURS AFTER I GET THE JOB. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YES, YES... WELL, FOLKS, THAT IS A CORE CAMPAIGN PROMISE. A PROMISE. READY ON DAY ONE TO PREPARE FOR DAY TWO. BUT... HOPE NOTHING HAPPENS. HOPE NOTHING HAPPENS. WHEN YOU'RE PRESIDENT, YOU'RE ALSO COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. DOES HE HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO LEAD THE MILITARY? YES, ACCORDING TO MANY MILITARY EXPERTS WHO ARE DONALD TRUMP. AS HE EXPLAINED TO HIS BIOGRAPHER, WHILE HE HAS NEVER SERVED, HE HAS, QUOTE, ALWAYS FELT HE WAS IN THE MILITARY BECAUSE HE WENT TO A MILITARY-THEMED BOARDING SCHOOL. (LAUGHTER) YES, SAME REASON I FEEL LIKE A NASCAR DRIVER BECAUSE AS A DID I HAD A RACE CAR BED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT WAS FUN. THAT WAS FUN. HERE'S THE THING, TRUMP ATTENDED NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T THE SAME AS COMBAT, TRUMP AGREES -- IT'S BETTER. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE HE SAYS HIS EXPERIENCE GAVE HIM MORE TRAINING MILITARILY THAN A LOT OF GUYS WHO GO INTO THE MILITARY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) YES, YES! HE DIDN'T SEE ANY ACTIVE DUTY BUT HE WAS ON THE RING HOP COMMITTEE, AND HE GOT THE NEATNESS AND ORDER MEDAL. NEATNESS AND ORDER -- THAT'S LIKE THE PURPLE HEART OF MAKING YOUR BED. (LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY, DONALD TRUMP WAS SENT TO MILITARY SCHOOL AFTER YEARS OF ROWDY BEHAVIOR THAT A MORE TRADITIONAL PREP SCHOOL IN QUEENS. HOW ROWDY? HE ONCE GAVE A TEACH AIR BLACK EYE BECAUSE -- TEACHER A BACK EYE BECAUSE, QUOTE, HE DIDN'T THINK HE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT MUSIC. NOTE TOSELF, DO NOT BOOK TRUMP THE SAME NIGHT AS YO YO MA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A GUY I KNOW VERY WELL, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED HALF A CENTURY AGO. I'M NOT SAYING DONALD TRUMP'S CHILDHOOD REFLECTS ON WHO HE IS TODAY. DONALD TRUMP IS. BECAUSE HE SAID, QUOTE, WHEN I LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE FIRST GRADE AND LOOK AT MYSELF NOW, I'M BASICALLY THE SAME, THE TEMPERAMENT IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER) AND I THINK IT'S TRUE! EVEN BACK THEN, WHEN HE BUILT A WALL OF BLOCKS, HE MADE SURE THE MEXICANS WOULD PAY FOR IT. STICK AROUND FOR EMILY BLUNT AND "THE DEAD WEATHER"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHOO! HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE TO WISH MY JEWISH VIEWERS A HAPPY ROSH  HASHANNAH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ FOR HE'S A ROSH  HASHANNAH ♪ ♪ FOR HE'S A ROSH  HASHANNAH ♪ ♪ FOR HE'S A ROSH  HASHANNAH ♪ ♪ -- AND FOR MY GENTILE VIEWERS A NATIONAL HAPPY "EAT A HOAGIE DAY." (LAUGHTER) LOOK IT UP. OF COURSE, I'M A CATHOLIC MYSELF, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT RELIGION YOU ARE BECAUSE WE ALL SURRENDER TO A HIGHER POWER, MY SPONSORS. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT GETS ALL UP IN YOUR FACE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) TONIGHT, I GET ALL UP IN YOUR BUDDHISM. IT'S A RELIGION THAT BELIEVES IN THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS, AND JUDGING BY BUDDHA HERE, THE ELEVEN HERBS AND SPICES. THE LEADER OF TIBETAN BUDDHISM IS THE DALAI LAMA. THE LEADER SAYS THE CURRENT DALAI LAMA IS A CURRENT REINCARNATION OF A HOLY MONK WHO LIVED 700 YEARS AGO WHILE NONBELIEVERS SAY HE ISN'T. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S THE THING, THIS LAMA IS 80 YEARS OLD AND RIGHT NOW IT IS UNCLEAR WHO WILL SUCCEED HIM WHEN HE DIES BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO TRADITION, WHEN A DALAI LAMA DICE, HE'S REINCARNATED AS A CHILD AND BUDDHISTS SEARCH TO FIND HIM. ONCE THEY DO, HE IS GIVEN A SERIES OF TESTS TO PROVE HE IS THE OLD DALAI LAMA REINCARNATED AND LIKE WITH ALL TESTS, AMERICAN STUDENTS ARE WAY BEHIND THE KIDS IN ASIA. (LAUGHTER) BUT TURNS OUT, THIS LAMA MIGHT BE ALPACA-ING IT IN. (LAUGHTER)
THE SPIRITUAL LEADER TURNS 80 THIS SUMMER HINTED IN A RECENT INTERVIEW HE MAY NOT BE REINCARNATED WHEN HE DIES, SUGGESTING THE TITLE OF DALAI LAMA COULD END WITH HIM.
Stephen: OH, I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE -- (LAUGHTER) SOMEONE WANTS TO GO OUT AS UNDEFEATED LAMA CHAMP. HE'S GOING TO TAKE HIS NOTHINGNESS AND GO HOME. BUT, FOLKS, THERE ARE SERIOUS POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS TO SAYING GOODBYE DALAI. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE THE DALAI LAMA IS THE LEADER OF THE TIBETAN PEOPLE WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM MY GOOD FRIENDS IN CHINA, NI HAO, AND WOULD FOIL THE PLAN OF DALAI LAMA WHO ACCEPTS CHINA'S PRESENCE INTY BET AND HOPEFULLY ONE WHO DOESN'T HANG OUT WITH RICHARD GERE SO MUCH. (LAUGHTER) BUT CHINA ISN'T TAKE THIS SITTING DOWN CROSS-LEGGED IN A ROCK GARDEN. NO! IN FACT, THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY WARNED THAT THE DALAI LAMA MUST REINCARNATE, AND ON THEIR TERMS! (LAUGHTER) HEY! HEY! YOU BETTER TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, DALAI LAMA! BECAUSE IF YOU REFUSE TO COME BACK TO LIFE, THEY WILL KILL YOU! (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH EMILY BLUNT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING ACTOR WHO STARRED IN SUCH FILMS AS "THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA," "THE EDGE OF TOMORROW," "LOOPER" AND "INTO THE WOODS." HER NEW FILM IS "SICARIO," PLAYS A AN F.B.I. AGENT BATTLING DRUG CAR TELLS. TAKE A LOOK. (GUNFIRE)
DON'T MOVE! F.B.I.!
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!
DON'T MOVE! F.B.I.! (GUNFIRE)
ARE YOU HIT? I'M GOOD.
Stephen: OH, SHE'S VERY GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE WELCOME EMILY BLUNT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WOW! IT'S AMAZING OUT HERE!
Stephen: ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?
IT IS!
Stephen: THIS IS AN HONEST-TO-GOD BROADWAY THEATER HERE. IF YOU WANT TO SING A SONG, DON'T LET ME STOP YOU. I KNOW YOU HAVE THE CHOPS. I SAW YOU.
DO YOU LIKE MUSICALS?
Stephen: I LOVE THEM. DO YOU SING?  Stephen: WOUL -- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SING?
DO YOU KNOW AN OLD STANDARD.
Stephen: AS LONG AS IT'S PUBLIC DOMAIN.
AM I PUTTING YOU ON THE SPOT?
Stephen: NO, I'M PUTTING YOU ON THE SPOT. I'M SORRY TO DO THAT TO YOU. ♪ I HAVE OFTEN WALKED DOWN THE STREET BEFORE ♪ ♪ BUT THE PAVEMENT ALWAYS STAYED BENEATH MY FEET BEFORE ♪
Stephen: OH, COME ON... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BABY DOLL, THEY DON'T GIVE YOU ONE OF THESE JOBS UNLESS YOU CAN TRILL.
WHAT A GIFT YOU HAVE! SPHOO EVERYBODY LOVES YOU, EMILY BLUNT.
THEY DO? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I THINK THEY DO BECAUSE YOU APPEAL TO EVERYBODY. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF YOU'VE DONE. YOU'VE DONE SCI-FI THRILLERS LIKE "THE EDGE OF TOMORROW." ENGAGEMENT MUSICALS LIKE "ENTER THE WOODS." NOW "SICARIO," YOU'VE GOT A BEAM ON EVERY SQUARE.
IT'S A MIXED BAG. PEOPLE ARE LIKING IT.
Stephen: I SAW "SICARIO." IT'S A LITTLE CHILLING. IT'S A TOUGH LOOK AT THINGS ON THE BORDER.
VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WHAT DOES "SICARIO" MEAN?
IT MEANS "HIT MAN." THE MEXICAN SLANG TERM FOR "HIT MAN."
Stephen: AND WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY.
I COULDN'T SAY WHO THE HIT MAN IS. IT COULD BE ME OR ONE OF THE OTHERS. WE DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW. IF IT WERE YOU WOULDN'T IT TECHNICALLY BE SICARIA? (LAUGHTER)
I LOOK VERY MANLY IN THE CLIP.
Stephen: YOU DO. YOU LOOK EXTREMELY TOUGH. I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS IN THE EDGE OF TOMORROW YOU'RE TOUGH. IN THIS, YOU'RE VERY TOUGH.
I FEEL THERE IS A SHORT LIST OF WOMEN WHO APPEAR AS IF THEY COULD DO A PUSHUP NOW. IT'S ME AND CHARLIZE THERON --
Stephen: SCARLETT JOHANSSON.
SHE COULD DO A ONE-HAND PUSHUP. MAYBE WHEN SHE WAS ON THE SHOW.
Stephen: SHE WAS ON LAST WEEK. I'M SORRY. IS IT FAIR TO FEMALE ACTION STARS? YOU LOOK VERY TOUGH OUT THERE.
IT'S A GIVEN. FOR ME, ITS DEPENDS ON WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF STRENGTH AND TOUGH. IS IT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE A GUN IN BOTH FILMS? (LAUGHTER) I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT'S WHY I APPEAR TOUGH.
Stephen: I HEARD THAT IT WAS -- YOU KNOW, THIS FILM ALMOST DIDN'T GET MADE BECAUSE IT HAD A FEMALE LEAD IN THE ACTION POSITION.
A MALE LEAD.
Stephen: FEMALE IN TRADITIONALLY WHAT WAS A MALE TRADITION.
YES, THE WIFE WAS APPROACHED BY ONE FINANCE YEAR WHO SAID IF YOU MAKE HER A DUDE, WE'LL UP YOUR BUDGET.
Stephen: AND THEY HELD THE LINE?
WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU'VE DONE A COUPLE OF ACTION FILMS NOW. DO YOU HAVE, AS A WOMAN IN THE ACTION FILMS, IS IT LIKE PRISON, DO YOU HAVE TO GO ON SET AND PUNCH THE BIGGEST GUY ON SET?
YES, IT'S HIM.
Stephen: HE'S AMAZING IN EVERYTHING HE DOES. WE KNOW THE BAD ONE HE DID. FOR HOW MUCH TO HAVE THE FILMING IS HE AWAKE? HE'S ALWAYS TURNING INTO GREAT PERFORMANCES BUT HIS EYES ARE, LIKE -- AND HE MUMBLES THE ENTIRE TIME.
HE LIKES TO BE MYSTERIOUS. I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN HIM SOMEHOW ABOUT HIS EYES LOOKING LIKE THAT, BUT WHEN HE DOES THE RED CARPET, THE LIGHTS ARE SO BRIGHT, THEY NARROW EVEN MORE. YOU HEAR FROM PHOTOGRAPHERS, OPEN YOUR EYES! AND THEY'RE OPEN.
Stephen: HE LOOKS LIKE A SUBTERRANEAN ANIMAL DRAGGED IN. H HE'S LIKE PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL ON GROUNDHAWG DAY. IF HE SEES HIS SHADOW, THE FILM GETS SIX MORE WEEKS OF RELIEF. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU JUST BECAME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
I DID. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY JUST DON'T LIKE ME BEING BRITISH. THEY PREFER ME THIS WAY.
Stephen: IN THIS MOVIE, YOU DON'T HAVE AN ACCENT AT ALL. IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMERICAN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: I COULDN'T TELL AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE FAKING.
I WAS DEFINITELY FAKING.
Stephen: I WANT TO TEST YOUR AMERICAN ACCENT TO SEE HOW AMERICAN YOU ARE. (LAUGHTER) WOULD YOU PLEASE SAY THIS WORD -- (LAUGHTER) HOW WOULD YOU PRONOUNCE THIS WORD?
MERICA.
Stephen: YEAH! YOU GOT IT! YOU NEED A FLAG AND A SHOTGUN!
I ONLY KNOW THIS BECAUSE THE NIGHT I BECAME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, MY HUSBAND THREW ME A&M URIACN PARTY, AND IT WAS ON THE INVITE (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU AND I SHARE ONE OTHER THING IN COMMON IS WE LOVE PRETENDING THAT WE'RE THROWING UP.
MY HUSBAND AND I ARE OBSESSED WITH YOUR PUKE TAKES. IT'S OUR FAVORITE THING. WE DO IT ALL THE TIME. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I THINK PRETENDING TO THROW UP CAN ALMOST MAKE ANYTHING BETTER. SO LET'S TRY. LET'S YOU AND ME -- YOU'RE A GREAT ACTRESS AND I CAN READ -- (LAUGHTER) LET'S DO THE VERY LAST TWO LINES OF "GONE WITH THE WIND." YOU BE SCARLETT O'HARA AND I'LL BE RHETT BUTLER. I'M LEAVING, IT'S FOGGY OUTSIDE, I'M ABOUT TO GO.
OH, RHETT -- RHETT -- RHETT -- GAGGING -- IF YOU -- WHERE SHALL I GO? (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: WELL... WHAT SHALL I DO -- (GAGGING)
Stephen: FRANKLY, MY -- (GAGGING)
OH...
Stephen: I DON'T -- (GAGGING) (LAUGHTER) I DON'T GIVE A -- (GAGGING) I DON'T GIVE A DAMN! (GAGGING) (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) EMILY BLUNT, WHAT A JOY. "SICARIO" OPENS IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES OCTOBER 18 EMILY BLUNT! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BEAUTIFUL. MURICA! YEAH! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. IN JUST A MOMENT I WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH SUPREME COURT JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK, "THE COURT AND THE WORLD." IT'S AN HONOR TO WELCOME HIM TO "THE LATE SHOW." IN MY OPINION, THIS MAN IS EASILY ONE OF THE TOP NINE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WORKING TODAY. (LAUGHTER) NOW FOR THE SMALL SEGMENT OF MY AUDIENCE OUT THERE WHO HASN'T ARGUED IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT, LET ME FILL YOU IN. THE HIGHEST FEDERAL COURT IN THE LAND IS THE SUPREME COURT, LIKE A REGULAR COURT BUT WITH SOUR CREAM AND SALSA. (LAUGHTER) THE COURT IS THE THIRD BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. THE OTHER TWO BRANCHES ARE NOT SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, THERE ARE NINE STICES, BOT JUST TONE SURE THERE CAN NEVER BE A TIE AND ALSO THEY'RE ALWAYS READY TO FIELD A SOFTBALL TEAM. THE JUSTICES PLAY A POWERFUL ROLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY! THEY'RE THE FINAL INTERPRETERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND THEIR DECISIONS CANNOT BE OVERTURNED EVEN BY THE PRESIDENT. THE ONLY PERSON WITH MORE POWER IS A KENTUCKY COUNTY CLERK... (LAUGHTER) OT SURE WHE WHY THE FOUNDERS PUT THAT IN THERE. L TONIGHT, JUSTIC JUSTICE BREYER HAS THE LEAST KNOWN OF THE SUPREMES. ONLY 3% OF THE AMERICANS COULD IDENTIFY THEM. THE OTHER 97% THINK HE'S MR. BURNS. (LAUGHTER) SO PEEL BACK THE ROBE, BENEATH THE MAN INSIDE THE MUUMUU, STEPHEN BREYER WAS JADE AT STANFORD, OXFORD AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY, WHICH MEANS HE HAS ACCRUED SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS STUDENT LOAN DEBT. (LAUGHTER) WHILE IN COLLEGE, THE FUTURE JUSTICE WAS ARRESTED FOR UNDERAGE DRINKING, WHICH IS A LESSON TO COLLEGE KIDS -- KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE OR YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND! (LAUGHTER) BREYER WAS NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT BY PRESIDENT CLINTON, AND IN CASE THIS IS A RERUN AIRING AFTER JANUARY 2017, LET ME CLARIFY, PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OVER THE YEARS, JUSTICE BREYER HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR HIS FIERY DISSENTS. IN AN 2007 DISSENT HE WROTE THE MAJORITY OPINION DISTORTS PRESS SENT AND MISAPPLIES PRINCIPALS. AND IN AN 2011 CONSUMER PROTECTION CASE BREYER SAID WHAT RATIONAL LAWYER WOULD HAVE SIGNED ON FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF FEES STEMMING FROM A $30 CLAIM. AND HE JUST INCLUDED A PHOTO COPY OF HIS MIDDLE FINGER IN A RULING IN CALIFORNIA CRAVMENT IT IS MY HONOR TO SIT DOWN WITH HIS HONOR. IF IT'S ANYTHING LIKE OTHER JUDGES, IT'S GOING TO END WITH 200 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. WE'LL BE BACK WITH ME V BREYER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOU'RE REALLY CLASSING UP THE JOINT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: MAKES ME FEEL VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE YOU HERE BECAUSE, USUALLY, WHEN YOU'RE SOMEPLACE, SOMETHING BIG IS BEING DECIDED, RIGHT?
SOMETIMES.
Stephen: YES. (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE? IS IT A GOOD JOB?
THE BIGGEST BENEFIT, PARTICULARLY AS YOU GET OLDER, IS YOU TAKE EVERY MINUTE OF IT VERY SERIOUSLY, AND IT CALLS FOR YOU TO PUT FORTH YOUR BEST EVERY SINGLE MINUTE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT FOR EVERYONE? (LAUGHTER) THAT'S JOB SECURITY!
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. IT MAKES ME THINK OF MY FATHER, BECAUSE MY FATHER'S SACRED ADVICE TO ME --
Stephen: YES? -- STAY ON THE PAYROLL. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: NEVER QUIT? NO.
Stephen: NEVER QUIT ANY JOB. THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. NOW, DO YOU EVER HAVE MOMENTS OF DOUBT, SIR? YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING, YOU'RE ABOUT TO DECIDE SOME OF THE BIG CASES AND YOU'RE SHAVING AND YOU GO, WHY ME? WHY DO I GET TO BE ONE OF THE NINE PEOPLE TO MAKE THE CALL HERE?
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS OF COURSE YOU DO. OF COURSE, YOU DO. THE FIRST THREE TO FIVE YEARS ON THE COURT, YOU MAY LOOK VERY CONFIDENT, BUT THAT ISN'T HOW YOU'RE FEELING. DAVID SOUDER TOLD ME THAT. IT TAKES A PERIOD OF TIME.
Stephen: IS THERE A BANKING MACHINE, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT --
Stephen: I'M THINKING ABOUT IT NOW.
AS A JUNIOR JUSTICE WHEN WE'RE SITTING IN OUR CONFERENCE ROOM, BY OURSELVES, WE DISCUSS THE CASES ALONE, AND IT'S THE JOB OF THE JUNIOR JUSTICE, WHICH I WAS FOR 11 YEARS, IN CASE SOMEONE KNOCKS ON THE DOOR, I OPEN IT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YEAH, SO YOU'RE LIKE A PLEDGE.
IN A SENSE. THERE MIGHT BE A PAPER. THERE MIGHT BE SOMETIMES THERE WAS COFFEE, AND ACTUALLY THERE WAS QUITE A GOOD REMARK, SOMEONE BROUGHT A JUSTICE COFFEE AND I SAID --
Stephen: HE SAID -- HE SAID, YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR SOME TIME AND I SAID, YES, I'VE GOTTEN VERY GOOD AT IT. HE SAID, I'M NOT SURE.
Stephen: A.C., THAT'S YOU, LET'S GO! (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "THE COURT AND THE WORLD," AMERICAN LAW AND THE NEW GLOBAL REALITY.
YES.
Stephen: THE SUPREME COURT IS ABOUT THE LAST PLACE IN AMERICA WHERE I COULDN'T BRING MY CAMERA CREW IN TO SHOOT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING, TO GET A VIDEO OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING. WHY CAN'T WE WATCH YOU? IF THE SUPREME COURT REPEATEDLY RULES WE CAN BE WATCHED BY THE GOVERNMENT?
AND THERE ARE VERY GOOD ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
Reporter: I JUST MADE A VERY GOOD ONE. IF YOU HAD CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM, YOU COULD JUST PUT THE BOOK ON THE EDGE OF YOUR DESK, AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT THERE, IN JUST WHAT YOU SAID, YOU'VE GIVEN PART OF THE ANSWER. YOU SEE? I'M IN A JOB WHERE WE WEAR BLACK ROBES IN PART BECAUSE WE'RE SPEAKING FOR THE LAW. EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS --
Stephen: AND PART TO MAKE YOU SPOOK J.
THAT'S A THOUGHT. BUT THE COUNTRY DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW THE CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO BREYER OR O'CONNOR. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO THIS THING IS. THAT'S TRUE OF THE PROCESS. IF YOU HAD CAMERAS RIGHT THERE IN THE PROCESS OF ORAL ARGUMENT, IF YOU HAD THAT, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REACTION EXACTLY WOULD BE AMONG THE LAWYERS AND OTHERS. THE ORAL ARGUMENT IS ABOUT 5% OF THE BASIS FOR DECIDING A CASE. IT'S ALMOST ALL IN WRITING. THE TOUGHEST PART ABOUT THIS QUESTION YOU POSED IS THIS -- WHEN I'M DECIDING A CASE, I'M DECIDING IT FOR 315 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THAT COURTROOM. THE RULE OF LAW, THE RULE OF INTERPRETATION, IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY. BUT HUMAN BEINGS CORRECTLY AND DECENTLY RELATE TO PEOPLE THEY SEE, AND THEY'LL SEE TWO LAWYERS, AND THEY'LL SEE TWO CLIENTS. WILL THEY UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE STORY? WILL THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING? WILL THERE BE DISTORTION? NOW, THAT'S THE ARGUMENT AGAINST YOU. THE ARGUMENT FOR YOU IS IT WOULD BE A FABULOUS EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.
Stephen: AND PRETTY ENTERTAINING SOMETIMES, TOO.
NO. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I DISAGREE. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT DISAGREEING FOR A SECOND. YOU GO TO WORK EVERY DAY AND MANAGE TO GET YOUR JOB DONE WITH A GROUP OF NINE PEOPLE, HALF OF WHOM WILL DISAGREE WITH YOU VEHEMENTLY ON A HOST OF DIFFERENT ISSUES. HOW COME YOU GUYS MANAGE TO KEEP DOING YOUR JOB AND THE REST OF THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T?
WHEN WE'RE SITTING AROUND THAT TABLE --
Stephen: YEAH? (APPLAUSE)
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LEAVE THE REST OF THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF IT, BUT I WILL SAY WHEN WE'RE SITTING AROUND THE TABLE, THE NINE OF US DISCUSSING, I HAVE BEEN THERE OVER 20 YEARS, 21, I HAVE NEVER HEARD A VOICE RAISED IN ANGER. I HAVE NEVER HEARD ONE MEMBER OF OUR COURT SAY SOMETHING INSULTING ABOUT ANOTHER, NOT EVEN AS A JOKE. OF COURSE, WE DISAGREE. WE DISAGREE ABOUT HALF THE TIME. WE'RE UNANIMOUS ABOUT HALF THE TIME. AND WE'RE 5-4, NOT ALWAYS THE SAME, AND WE'RE 20% OR SO, AND WE FEEL IT QUITE STRONGLY, BUT THE DISCUSSION IS PROFESSIONAL, IT IS SERIOUS, AND IT IS NOT PERSONAL, AND WE ARE GOOD FRIENDS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE AGREE SOME OF THE TIME AND WE DISAGREE OTHERS OF THE TIME.
Stephen: YOU'RE YELLING AT ME RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE YELLING AT ME RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) JUSTICE BREYER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME! "THE COURT AND THE WORLD"! THANK YOU, SIR! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
