STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!  ( CHEERS ) ♪ YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU. PLEASE SIT DOWN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THAT. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T LIKE-- AND IT MIGHT BE JUST ME-- YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T LIKE, INJUSTICE. WHENEVER THERE'S SOMEONE OPPRESSING SOMEONE ELSE, I'M RIGHT THERE. ON THE SIDELINES. FEELING BAD ABOUT IT. BUT NOW, A GREAT INJUSTICE HAS BEEN RIGHTED BECAUSE A FEDERAL COURT IN LOS ANGELES JUST STRUCK DOWN THE CENTURY-LONG COPYRIGHT TO THE SONG "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!" IT'S NOW PUBLIC DOMAIN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FREEDOM! FREEDOM! THIS IS ESPECIALLY POIGNANT FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN I STARTED OFF AS AN ACTOR, I WAS MOSTLY A WAITER FOR YEARS. AND AT THE RESTAURANT I WORKED AT, IF A CUSTOMER HAD A BIRTHDAY, THEY'D GET A FREE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE, AND MANAGEMENT TOLD US WE COULD SING ANY SONG WE WANTED AS LONG AS IT WASN'T HAPPY BIRTHDAY BECAUSE OF THE COPYRIGHT ISSUE. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. THIS IS THE ACTUAL SONG WE MADE UP TO SING TO THE CUSTOMERS. WE'D ALL GET OUT THERE. WE'D GIVE THEM THE PIECE OF MOUSSE. ALL THE WAITERS WOULD GATHER AROUND BECAUSE WE ALL HAD TO DO IT. AND WE'D ALL STAND AROUND THE TABLE AND GO. ♪ IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY, HEY, HEY, HEY. ♪ IT'S YOUR MOUSSE AND GO AWAY. HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. ♪ WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE ANYWAY, HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY. AH, ( BLEEP ) OFF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY SONG IS FREE NOW. I'D SAY "DING DONG, THE WITCH IS DEAD," BUT YOU STILL GOT TO PAY FOR THAT ONE. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS FREE, FOLKS. TONIGHT'S SHOW. AND I REALLY SHOULD BE CHARGING YOU UPON. MY FIRST GUEST IS NOT FAMOUS, HE BROUGHT A FAMOUS PERSON WITH HIM. I'M TALKING TO THE FOUNDER OF THE GLOBAL CITIZEN FESTIVAL, HUGH EVANS, AS WELL AS ACTOR HUGH JACKMAN, WHO-- ( APPLAUSE )
HE GOT MUSCLES ON HIM.
Stephen: HUGE JACKMAN. WHO WILL BE COHOSTING THE FESTIVAL WITH ME THIS SATURDAY IN CENTRAL PARK IN FRONT OF 60,000 PEOPLE. SO I HOPE HUGH JACKMAN GETS THERE EARLY TO MARK OFF OUR SPOT WITH OUR BLANKET. THEN I'LL TALK TO MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU MEET HER?
YEAH, BACK STAGE. SHE HAS LAUNCHED A ONE-WOMAN CRUSADE AGAINST THE BILLIONAIRE CLASS. SO SHE'S LIKE BATMAN, BUT HER ENEMY IS BRUCE WAYNE. AND MY MUSICAL GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GREAT PEARL JAM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TEAR MY SLEEVES OFF. I DON'T THINK-- I ACTUALLY DO NOT THINK THIS WAS ME TEARING MY SLEEVES OFF SO I'D HAVE THE INSULATED UNDERWEAR UNDERNEATH AND FLANNEL AROUND MY WAIST, BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THE BAND PLAYS LIKE THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHO I'M DOING MY IMPRESSION OF. OH, I LOVE THAT SOUND. IT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT BEFORE THE BAND POPS OVER A CAN OF JAZZ-ASS, JUST ONE MORE THING-- NO CLAPPING. NO CLAPPING. I HAVE ANOTHER JOKE. A REPORT FROM THE U.N. SAYS THAT 4.2 BILLION PEOPLE IN THE WORLD STILL DON'T HAVE THE INTERNET, ALTHOUGH THREE BILLION OF THEM ARE JUST WAITING FOR THE TIME WARNER GUY TO SHOW UP. TONIGHT, I WELCOME HUGH JACKMAN AND HUGH EVANS. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY PEARL JAM. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ♪ ♪ ♪ AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT."
Stephen: YEAH! WHOOO!
WHOOO!
Stephen: WHOOO!
WHOOO!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: WHOOO!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. OH, THE EXCITEMENT. THE EXCITEMENT IS RICH IN THIS ROOM. CAN CAN YOU SMELL-ELL-ELL-ELL THE INCENSE? BECAUSE POPE FRANCE SIS NOW ON AMERICAN SOIL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND FOLKS I COWED NOT-- AS A CATHOLIC I COULD NOT BE MORE HUMBLY EXCITED. YAY-MEN! ( LAUGHTER ) THE PEOPLE'S POPE MADE HEADLINES THE SECOND HE ARRIVED, GETTING PICKED UP AT THE AIRPORT NOT IN A LIMOUSINE BUT IN A FIAT, PROVING HE IS NOT ONLY A MAN OF GREAT HUMILITY BUT A MAN OF TREMENDOUS FAITH. HEAVENLY FATHER, PLEASE LET THIS CAR MAKE IT TO THE HOTEL FOR, LO, IT IS BUT A MOTORIZED ROLLER SKATES. THE THE POPE VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE, GREETED BY A LAVISH SOUTH LAWN WELCOME, "THE MOST REGAL OF PAGEANTRIES THAT WASHINGTON HAS TO OFFER." OH, THE PAGEANTRY! IT'S JUST LIKE A WEDDING. THIS GUEST OF HONOR EVEN WORE A WHITE DRESS. AND THE POPE REALLY ENJOYED-- A SHORT NAP. BECAUSE APPARENTLY HE FELL ASLEEP DURING THE CEREMONY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, COME ON. CUT THE GUY SOME SLACK. HE'S GOT JET LAG. HE WAS IN CUBA YESTERDAY, AND THE TIME DIFFERENCE IS... 1952. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S A WHIRLWIND. IT'S A WHIRLWIND-- I GOTTA GET ME ONE OF THOSE. IT'S A WHIRLWIND TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR IL PAPA, WITH STOPS IN PHILADELPHIA, WASHINGTON, D.C., AND NEW YORK CITY. STICKING TO THE EAST COAST, OF COURSE, BECAUSE OF THAT BEEF HE HAS WITH HOLOGRAM TUPAC. FOLKS, AS A CATHOLIC, I AM A TOTAL FRANCIS FANBOY, BUT NOT EVERYBODY LIKES WHAT HE'S DOING. SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE, POPE FRANCIS HAS BEEN MODERNIZING THE VATICAN. HE'S EMBRACED EVOLUTION, WELCOMED GAY WORSHIPPERS AND RELEASED THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AS A BUZZFEED LISTICLE THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE WILL LOVE NUMBER NINE. WHICH BY THE THE WAY WAS ALSO THE NAME OF MY HIGH SCHOOL METAL BAND. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT WHAT'S REALLY GETTING PEOPLE'S CHAUSIBLE IN A BUNCH ARE STATEMENTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE, LIKE THIS ONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING.
ACCEPTING THE URGENCY, IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME ALSO THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A PROBLEM WE CAN NO LONGER BE LEFT TO OUR FUTURE GENERATION.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ENGLISH ISN'T HIS FIRST LANGUAGE. THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOUGH TO CATCH. LET ME READ IT TO YOU. "ACCEPTING THE URGENCY, IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME ALSO THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A PROBLEM WE CAN NO LONGER BE LEFT TO OUR FUTURE GENERATION." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, THE PONTIFF-- HE READ IT PRETTY WELL, ACTUALLY. HE READ IT PRETTY WELL. WHAT THE PONTIFF IS ASKING IS FOR ALL OF US TO CHANGE OUR POSITION ON CARBON EMISSION, WHICH IS SURPRISING BECAUSE FOR YEARS THE CHURCH HAS HAD A CLEAR EMISSIONARY POSITION. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) THIS-- THIS IS A BOLD--  ( CHEERS ) THIS IS A BOLD STEP FORWARD FOR MY CHURCH, AND, AS A CATHOLIC, I COULDN'T BE PROUDER. EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR ALL THE THINGS I'M ASHAMED OF. BUT SOME DON'T LIKE IT OUT THERE, AND ANGER ON THE POPE'S VIEWS ON GLOBAL WARMING WILL COME TO A HEAD TOMORROW MORNING BECAUSE CATHOLIC ARIZONA CONGRESSMAN AND SUPERCUTS TEST MODEL PAUL GOSAR HAS ANNOUNCED HE'S BOYCOTTING POPE FRANCIS' ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, ADDING "IF THE POPE WANTS TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE, THEN HE CAN DO SO IN HIS PERSONAL TIME." PERSONAL TIME? WHAT PERSONAL TIME ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT GOSAR GOZERIAN? A POPE IS ALWAYS POPE, EVEN WHEN EVEN WHEN HE'S POPED. HE EVEN WORKS SUNDAYS! EVEN WORSE, GOSAR ALSO SAID ABOUT THE POPE, "TO PROMOTE QUESTIONABLE SCIENCE AS CATHOLIC DOGMA IS RIDICULOUS." SO I GUESS WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN IS SAYING IS THE POPE SHOULD BE PROMOTING HARD SCIENCE, LIKE WALKING ON WATER AND VIRGIN BIRTHS. COME ON! COME ON! ( APPLAUSE ) ONE CATHOLIC TO ANOTHER? "HOC EST TAURUM STERCORE." THIS IS THE VICAR OF CHRIST YOU'RE WALKING OUT ON. I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FLOCK WHAT YOUR PERSONAL DOCTRINE IS, YOU DO NOT DISRESPECT THE BISHOP OF ROME. AND IF YOU'RE SO STUCK IN YOUR WAYS-- AND, YES, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TALK I'M SO ANGRY. AND IF YOU'RE SO STUCK IN YOUR WAYS THAT YOU WOULD GIVE UP YOUR CHANCE TO HEAR THE WORDS OF OUR HOLY FATHER, THEN CAN I HAVE YOUR TICKETS? JUST OVERNIGHT THEM TO STEPHEN COLBERT, CARE OF THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. AND IF I RUN INTO THE POPE, I GOT YOU COVERED. I'LL HAVE THE NEAREST THREE-YEAR-OLD CUT MY HAIR, AND I'LL SAY I'M YOU. STICK AROUND FOR HUGH JACKMAN, ELIZABETH WARREN AND PEARL JAM. ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. GIVE IT UP EVERYBODY. JON, BEFORE WE CONTINUE THE SHOW, I HAVE SOMETHING I NEED TO DISCUSS WITH YOU, AND IT'S KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE. I HOP YOU DON'T MIND. ARE YOU HAPPY HERE AT THE "LATE SHOW"?
Jon: OF COURSE I AM! I GET TO MEET INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, PLAY THE MUSIC I LOVE, AND THERE ARE FREE POPTARTS IN THE BREAK ROOM!
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT FLAVOR IS THAT BY THE WAY?
Jon: CAMPFIRE.
Stephen: IT'S A COLLECTIBLE FLAVOR.
Stephen: IT'S SWEET.
Stephen: IF YOU ARE HAPPY, THEN THERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY DID I SEE THIS IN A BOOKSTORE THIS MORNING? "UNDERNEATH THE CHUCKLES: LIFE, LAUGHS, LOSS, LOVE AND LEARNING-- BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT," BY JON BATISTE. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
Jon: OH, MAN, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU. I WROTE A BOOK.
Stephen: I SEE THAT. JON, THERE'S SOME ROUGH STUFF IN HERE. YOU SAID AND I QUOTE: "STEPHEN COLBERT MAY SEEM LIKE A NICE GUY, BUT NO ONE EVER SEES HIS BAD SIDE." JON, WHY WOULD YOU WRITE THAT?
Jon: IT'S TRUE, STEPHEN. NO ONE EVER SEES YOUR BAD SIDE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE. THAT'S HOW NICE YOU ARE!
Stephen: OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS? "PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME, JON, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN COMMON WITH STEPHEN? MORE THAN YOU'D THINK. ONE TIME, I WAS IN LINE BEHIND HIM AT THE A.T.M., AND I SAW THAT HIS PIN NUMBER IS 1899, THE YEAR MY FAVORITE MUSICIAN, DUKE ELLINGTON, WAS BORN." JON, YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE MY PIN NUMBER!
Jon: WAIT, CHECK THE FOOTNOTESES.
Stephen: "ATTENTION, THIEVES: DO NOT USE THIS PIN NUMBER."
Jon: SEE? IT'S COOL!
Stephen: NO, JON, IT'S NOT COOL. IT'S NOT COOL AT ALL. WHAT ABOUT THIS PART: "THERE'S NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT STEPHEN COLBERT DOESN'T USE METH."
Jon: WHOA, SHUCKS, THAT'S A TYPO.
Stephen: A TYPO.
Stephen: YEAH, MAN, THAT SHOULD HAVE SAID, "NOT A DAY GOES BY WHEN STEPHEN DOESN'T USE MATH, MATHEMATICS."
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE, JON I DO USE IT EVERY DAY.
Jon: ME, TOO, I'M MAKING A TON OF MONEY OFF THIS BOOK. BESIDES, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE STUFF IN THERE, TOO PB CHECK OUT PAGE 263.
Stephen: 263. "HERE'S A MIND-BLOWING FACT: GIRAFFES HAVE PREHENSILE TONGUES THAT STRETCH NEARLY 20 INCHES LONG. SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THE TONGUE'S DARK PURPLE COLOR IS AN ADAPTATION TO PREVENT SUNBURN." JON, WHAT IS THIS?
Jon: OH, THAT'S FROM THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE FOR "GIRAFFES." WE'VE ONLY BEEN DOING SHOWS FOR THREE WEEKS NOW. I NEEDED SOME MORE CHAPTERS. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT GIRAFFES ARE GREAT, JON, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD FOR ME TO FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.
Jon: OKAY, AT LEAST CHECK THE DEDICATION PAGE.
Stephen: "TO MY BEST FRIEND, STEPHEN COLBERT, WHO HAS THE BIGGEST HEART IN THE WORLD. EXCEPT GIRAFFES, WHOSE HEARTS CAN WEIGH OVER 24 POUNDS. INCREDIBLE!" OH, JON. I'M SORRY I WAS EVER MAD AT YOU!
Jon: OH, MAN, THANKS, BRO. JUST REMEMBER YOU SAID THAT NEXT WEEK WHEN THE LIVETIME MOVIE COMES OUT, "16 FEET FROM A MONSTER, THE OFFICIAL UNAUTHORIZED BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK IN FRONT OF THE SCENES AT THE 'LATE SHOW'" STARRING HARRY HAMLIN AND LEVAR BURTON.
Stephen: WOW! I'VE USE WANTED TO BE PLAYED BY LEVAR BURTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH HUGH EVANS AND HUGH JACKMAN. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS ARE THE FOUNDER AND CO-HOST OF THIS WEEKEND'S GLOBAL CITIZEN'S FESTIVAL, AN ANNUAL EVENT HOSTED BY THE GLOBAL POVERTY PROJECT TO END EXTREME POVERTY BY 2030. PLEASE WELCOME HUGH EVANS AND HUGH JACKMAN. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU.
WOW.
Stephen: ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?
BEAUTIFUL!
Stephen: IT'S INCREDIBLE. YOU HAVE TO REALLY FIGHT THE URGE TO GET UP AND SING AND DANCE IN THIS PLACE.
YOU DO.
Stephen: MAYBE LATER. GUYS, HUGH, HUGH. I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO TELL YOU TWO APART DURING THIS.
I'M THE YOUNGER ONE.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE YOUNGER ONE, ALL RIGHT. AND YOU'RE THE ONE SAVING WORLD.
I'M THE ONE TRAINING TO BE A WOLVERINE.
Stephen: YOU COULD USE COLD FRONT REIN. HUGH EVANS YOU ARE THE FOUNDER OF SOMETHING CALLED GLOBAL CITIZEN.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU HAVE AN AMAZINGLY-- WHAT'S BEEN CALLED AN INSANELY OPTIMISTIC GOAL, AND TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT IT IS.
WELL, OUR GOAL IS THAT WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE COULD BE THE FIRST GENERATION TO END EXTREME POVERTY WITHIN OUR LIFETIME.
Stephen: OKAY, AND WHAT'S YOUR DATE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT DOES SEEM CRAZY. IT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT-- THERE IS SO MUCH POVERTY IN THE WORLD AND THE POOR HAVE BEEN WITH HUMANITY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. THAT REALLY DOES SEEM LIKE KIND OF A CRAZY THING THAT YOU THINK IS WITHIN REACH OF HUMANITY. WHAT'S THE DATE YOU WANT TO DO IT BY?
WE WANT TO DO IT BY 2030.
Stephen: END GLOBAL POVERTY BY 2030.
FOREVER BY 2030, AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF USELESS SUFFERING WHERE A CHILD WOULD DIE FROM LACK OF A VACCINATION.
Stephen: THAT'S INCREDIBLY REFRESHING TO MEET SOMEONE WHO THINKS THE THERE WILL BE A WORLD IN 2030. YOU HEARD DONALD TRUMP IS LEADING IN THE POLLS.
I HEARD THAT.
Stephen: HUGH JACKMAN, RIGHT.
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
Stephen: HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT HUGH EVANS PITCHED YOU THIS IDEA. WHAT WAS HIS PITCH TO YOU TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE HIS PITCH TO ME WAS, "I GET TO MEET HUGH JACKMAN."
HE TOLD ME I GET TO BE ON THE "STEPHEN COLBERT SHOW" AND I'M LIKE I'M IN I WAS AT A CONFERENCE IN AUSTRALIA, THE 2020 CONFERENCE, BACK IN 2008, AND OUR PRIME MINISTER BOUGHT BRAUT TOGETHER 1,000 AUSSIES TO TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT WE WANTED THE COUNTRY TO LOOK LIKE 12 YEARS FROM THEN. SO AT THE DRINKS THAT FIRST NIGHT, I LOOKED OVER IN THE CORNERRER AND THERE WAS A GUY IN A BLACK SUIT AND WHITE SHIRT AND I PRESUMED IT WAS THE WAITER-- YOU WERE ABOUT 12 AT THE TIME. AND I WENT OVER AND SAID CAN I GRAB A DRINK? AND HE SAID, SURE, WHAT DO YOU WANT. AND I SAID A GIN AND TONIC. AND HE CAME OVER WITH TWO AND I SAID JUST ONE. AND HE SAID, "ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR ME." ANYWAY-- HE WENT AND GOT ME A DRINK. HE ACTUALLY WAS ONE OF THE DELEGATES. HE WAS THE YOUNG AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR. I WAS SO EMBARRASSED, LIKE, I ASKED HIM TO GET ME A DRINK.
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT PLAN, THAT'S A GREAT PLAN FOR TRYING TO START A GLOBAL MOVEMENT IS FIRST YOU GET CELEBRITIES DRUNK.
EXACTLY. THEN END EXTREME POVERTY. THREE HOURS LATER, WE WERE STILL TALKING AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED THAT, OF COURSE, LIKE MOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, WE WANT TO SEE AN END TO EXTREME POVERTY BUT ANY IDEA I HAD WAS KIND OF REDUNDANT AFTER TALKING TO HUGH, AND I SAID, LISTEN, HUGH, I JUST WANT TO JUMP ON BOARD. WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING I'M IN. AND THIS IS IT.
Stephen: YOU GUYS ARE BOTH FROM AUSTRALIA. IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT STRAUL AUSTRALIANS THAT THEY WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD? I RECENTLY SAW "MAD MAX FURY ROAD." IS THAT THE FUTURE YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID.
THAT IS AUSTRALIA RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: IS IT.
YES.
Stephen: LET'S TALK. HOW PEOPLE GET INVOLVED IN GLOBAL CITIZEN. YOU CAN'T BUY TICKETS TO THIS FESTIVAL THAT WE'RE COHOSTING ON SATURDAY WITH, BY THE WAY, SELMA HAYEK, KERRY WASHINGTON, OLIVIA WILDE, PERFORMANCES BY PEARL JAM, BEYONCE, EDSHERIN, AND COLDPLAY. 60,000 PEOPLE. WHAT HAVE PEOPLE HAD TO DO IN ORDER TO GET TICKETS FOR THIS THING?
THE WAY IT WORKS YOU CAN'T BUY YOUR WAY IN. YOU HAVE TOO TAKE ACTION ON GLOBALCITIZEN.ORG, AND TAKE ACTION ON AN ISSUE YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHEN YOU CALLED OUT GLOBAL CITIZENS TO TWEET THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORWAY.
Stephen: MY ISSUE WAS GIRLS' EDUCATION AROUND THE WORLD.
AND WE KNOW NORWAY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A LEADER FOR GIRLS' EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR LEADING THE WAY.
Stephen: WE GOT 153,000 TWEETS TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORWAY AND SHE HAS RESPONDED.
SHE GOT SO OVERWHELMED BY THE TWEETS SHE SAID COME TO OSLO AND MEET WITH US. AND SHE SAID, "WHEN WILL THE TWITTER CAMPAIGN STOP? I'M COMING TO THE FESTIVAL." SO IT WORKED THANK YOU.
Stephen: AND THEY COMMITTED $100 MILLION FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO GIRLS' EDUCATION.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Stephen: THERE IS ALSO-- THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO ON THEIR OWN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO IS FAMOUS GETTING 153,000 PEOPLE TO TWEET AT NORWAY, AGO IT WAS FUN TO RATTLE THE NORWAY CAGE. PEOPLE CAN DO THEIR OWN THING. THEY CAN WRITE THEIR CONGRESSMEN.
SIGN PETITIONS.
Stephen: THEY CAN SIGN PETITIONS.
MAKE PHONE CALL S.
Stephen:  THEY CAN APPEAL TO MEMBERS OF THE U.N. THE U.N. IS GATHERING THIS WEEK-- AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SAME WEEKEND THE FESTIVAL IS GOING ON, THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS MEETING. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO DO IT WHEN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS IN SESSION?
THIS IS ACTUALLY A HISTORIC YEAR BECAUSE 2015 IS THE YEAR WHERE-- TO QUOTE THE UNDER SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS --
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.
HE SAID THIS IS THE MOST HISTORIC YEAR SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED NATIONS 70 YEARS AGO BECAUSE THIS IS THE WEEK WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS ADOPTS A NEW SET OF GLOBAL GOALS, 17 GOALS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DESIGNED TO END EXTREME POVERTY BY 2030, TACKLE INEQUALITY, AND ALSO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE ALL TOGETHER. SO THIS IS A HISTORIC MOMENT, AND THERE ARE MORE WORLD LEADERS IN TOWN THIS WEEK THAN THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE WHOLE 70 YEARS OF THE UNITED NATIONS HISTORY. AND SO WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY THIS WEEKEND TO ACTUALLY GET WORLD LEADERS TO STAND UP AND SAY, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO BE A GENERATION OF BYSTANDERS. WE WANT TO BE GLOBAL CITIZENS.
Stephen: AND THESE GOALS THAT ARE-- THESE GOALS AS EXPRESSED AT THE U.N. AND AS COMMITTED TO BY THE COUNTRIES IN THE U.N. ACTUALLY HAVE AN EFFECT. TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS OF THE GLOBAL GOALS OF THE U.N.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE LAST 15 YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ANTIPOVERTY PUSH IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY. MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF EXTREME POVERTY IN THE LAST 20 YEARS THAN IN THE 200 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT. AND SO WHILE I'VE BEEN ALIVE, EXTREME POVERTY HAS  PLUMMETED FROM 52% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION IN 1981 DOWN TO LESS THAN 20% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION TODAY. SO AMAZING PROGRESS HAS HAPPENED WHILE WE'VE BEEN ALIVE.
Stephen: THERE'S NO REASON TO BE CYNICAL. THERE'S NO REASON TO BE HOPELESS. PEOPLE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY PUTTING EFFORT INTO IT AND URGING THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO JOIN THE CAMPAIGN.
100%.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. HUGH EVANS, HUGH JACKMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE GLOBAL CITIZEN FESTIVAL IS THIS-- THE GLOBAL CITIZEN FESTIVAL IS THIS SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, IN CENTRAL PARK. I'LL SEE YOU THERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY NEXT GUEST IS THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS. SHE'S ALSO BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE SHERIFF OF WALL STREET. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE. THIS IS AMAZING.
Stephen: ISN'T IT NICE? ALL PAID FOR WALL STREET MONEY. ALL PAID FOR WITH WALL STREET.
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?
Stephen: NOW, SENATOR WARREN, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, BABY, IF I MAY COIN A CORPORATE PHRASE.
FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO NEW YORK.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU, YOU WERE NOT A SENATOR. NOW YOU ARE A SENATOR. AND NOT ONLY-- NOT ONLY ARE YOU A SENATOR YOU'RE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD NAMES IN AMERICAN POLITICS. AND YET YOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW HOUSEHOLD NAMES THAT IS NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? HAVE YOU CHECKED THE NEWSPAPERS LATELY, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED IN. YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IN YOUR SLEEP.
I'M SURE I'M NOT.
Stephen: I THINK THESE DAYS POLITICIANS HAVE TO CHECK THE "OPT-OUT" BUTTON. YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU'D BE SUCH A TERRIBLE CHOICE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE CLAMORING FOR AN ELIZABETH WARREN PRESIDENCY.
LOOK, I'M OUT THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE FIGHT, AND IT'S A FIGHT ABOUT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW, THE GAME IS RIGGED. AND WE'VE GOT --
WHEN YOU SAY "GAME" WHEN YOU SAY "GAME--" THAT'S A DRAMATIC THING TO SAY. WHAT IS THE GAME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND HOW IT'S RUN. HERE WE ARE, THE RICHEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, WE JUST-- WE HAVE SO MUCH GOING FOR US, AND YET, WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS GREAT FOR MILLIONAIRES. IT WORKS GREAT FOR BILLIONAIRES. IT WORKS GREAT FOR GIANT CORPORATIONS, FOR ANYBODY WHO CAN HIRE AN ARMY OF LOBBYISTS, AN ARMY OF LAWYERS, GIVE LOTS OF CAMPAIGN MONEY. FOR THE REST OF AMERICA, IT'S JUST NOT WORKING, AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO TAKE THAT GOVERNMENT BACK AND MAKE IT WORK FOR US? >>. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, SO HOW DO YOU UNRIG THE SYSTEM? IF THE GAME IS RIGGED, HOW DO YOU DE-RIG IT? DO YOU HAVE TO END THE GAME? DO YOU HAVE TO KNOCK OVER THE MONOPOLY BOARD AND PICK UP THE PIECES?
PARTLY, OKAY, BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. WE NEED TO RUN THIS COUNTRY BASICALLY FOR PEOPLE, FOR MIDDLE-CLASS, FOR WORKING PEOPLE, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET A CHANCE. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT IN AMERICA. COMING OUT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION TOGETHER WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO TWO THINGS-- WE WERE GOING TO PUT A COP ON THE BEAT ON WALL STREET-- AND WE DID THAT. AND THE SECOND THING WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MAKE INVESTMENT IN THINGS THAT CREATE OPPORTUNITY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. EDUCATION --
AND DEFEAT HITLER. AND DEFEAT HITLER.
EDUCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, BRIDGES, BASIC RESEARCH. WE MADE THOSE INVESTMENTS, AND HERE'S THE THING-- IT WORKED. G.D.P. WENT UP, AND THE 90% OF AMERICA-- NOT THE TOP 10%-- BUT THE 90% OF AMERICA, THEY GOT 70% OF ALL INCOME GROWTH, 1935-1980. THAT IS WHEN WE BUILT AMERICA'S GREAT MIDDLE CLASS. WE DID IT AND WE DID IT TOGETHER. THAT'S HOW WE BUILT IT.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU BET.
Stephen: IS THAT ALL REGULATORY? IS THAT ALL CHANGING THE PEOPLE IN OFFICE OR IS THAT MERELY EXERCISING REGULATORY POWER THAT ALREADY EXISTS RIGHT NOW?
SO, LET'S THEN SEE WHAT HAPPENED STARTING IN 1980. RIGHT, SO HERE WE BUILD THIS GREAT MIDDLE CLASS, THE PIE IS GETTING BIGGER, EVERYBODY IS GETTING MORE. WE START, AROUND 1980-- YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENS THEN.
Stephen: UH, WE WON AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION IN ICE HOCKEY. ( LAUGHTER ).
GOOD...
Stephen: UH, I GOT MY FIRST GIRLFRIEND. ( LAUGHTER ) I REMEMBER THAT. I REMEMBER THAT. THAT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL.
REMEMBER TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMIC S.
Stephen:  I DO REMEMBER TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS. RICH GUYS LIKE ME YOU CUT MY TAXESES AND YOU GIVE ME MORE MONEY AND THEN I SPEND MORE AND EVENTUALLY IT TRICKLES DOWN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T MAKE THE KIND OF MONEY I DO.
EXCEPT THE LAST PART NEVER WORKED. SO WHAT TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS WAS SAYING TO THE RICH AND POWERFUL, THE GOVERNMENT WILL HELP YOU GET RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL.
Stephen: NOW THAT I'M RICH AND POWERFUL, DON'T RAISE MY TAXES. NOW THAT I'M HERE DON'T DO THIS TO ME, ELIZABETH. ISN'T THAT WHAT PEOPLE THINK? ISN'T THAT THE REASON IT'S HARD TO SALE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. EVERYBODY IN THE UNITED STATES, IS AN ASPIRATIONAL SOCIETY, WE BELIEVE WE'LL GET INTO THE TOP 1%, OR THE AND WE DON'T WANT THE CANDY TAKEN AWAY FROM US WHEN WE GET THERE.
NO, STEPHEN, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT.
Stephen: OH, BOY.
I THINK THE ASPIRATIONAL PART OF AMERICA TODAY IS TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THERE, WORK HARD, PLAY BY THE RULES AND KNOW YOU CAN HAVE SOME SECURITY, KNOW YOU CAN EDUCATE YOUR KIDS AND GET THEM THROUGH COLLEGE WITHOUT THEM BEING DROWNED IN DEBT, KNOWING YOU CAN PUT AWAY A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR RETIREMENT.
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU DOING SPECIFICALLY-- IT ALL SOUNDS GOOD. IT ALL SOUNDS GOOD. BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN?
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO GET OUT THERE AND FIGHT FOR IT. HERE'S THE PART WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. STARTING IN THE 1980s WHEN THE WHOLE NOTION WAS FIRE THE COPS-- IT WAS CALLED DEREGULATION. CUT TAXES FOR THOSE AT THE TOP MEANING THERE WAS LESS TO INVEST ON EDUCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, BASIC RESEARCH. WHAT'S HAPPENED FROM 1980 TO 2012, THE LATEST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE NUMBERS. THE 90%, EVERYBODY NOT IN THE TOP 10%, HOW MUCH OF THE GROWTH CAN THEY GET? THE G.D.P. KEPT GOING UP, HOW MUCH OF THE INCOME GROWTH DID THEY GET, AND THE ANSWER IS ZERO, NONE, NOT A BIT. 100% OF INCOME GROWTH IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE 1980s HAS GONE TO THE TOP 10%. THAT IS NOT ONLY WRONG. THAT IS GOING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY UNLESS WE TAKE OUR GOVERNMENT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, THAT--
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
Stephen: BUT, THEN AGAIN, HOW DO YOU DO THAT? DO YOU-- YOU SAY YOU PUT A COP ON WALL STREET.
YEAH, AND THAT'S PART OF IT. WE BUILT A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU.
Stephen: BUT CAN YOU REALLY POLICE WALL STREET? I GOT BUDDIES DOWN THERE, OKAY. AND THEY TELL ME THAT-- YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE PERSON, ELIZABETH WARREN SEEMS LIKE AN INTELLIGENT PERSON. WHILE YOU'RE WRITING YOUR LAW, THEY HEAR YOU WRITING IT, AND THEY START CHANGE WHAT THEY DO WHILE YOU'RE WRITING IT SO BY THE TIME THE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THEM ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR GAME. YOU HAVE TO DO ALL YOUR LAWS IN SECRET AND MONDAY MORNING GO POW! AND START LOCKING PEOPLE UP.
YOU ARE RIGHT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM. AND THAT IS EVERY TIME THE LAWS ARE BEING WRITTEN, WHO IS IN THE ROOM? IT'S NOT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GOT HURT FROM THE LAWS BEING SO BAD, FROM THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO COPS ON WALL STREET, IT'S THE BIGGEST PLAYERS. THEY HAVE THEIR LOBBYISTS AND LAWYERS LINED UP. DON'T TELL ME WE CAN'T FIGHT BACK AND WIN BECAUSE ONE THING WE GOT IN THE DODD-FRANK, AND FINANCIAL REFORMS WHEN THEY WERE PASSED IN 2010, WE GOT THIS LITTLE AGENCY, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. SOUNDS A LITTLE BORING, A LITTLE BIT SMALL. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT AGENCY HAS DONE IT'S OUT THERE TO TRY TO WIPE OUT SOME OF THE WORST ABUSES ON MORTGAGES THAT GOT US INTO THIS, ON CREDIT CARDS, PAYDAY LOANS. THAT HAS BEEN UP AND OPERATIONAL FOR FOUR YEARS AND FORCED BIGGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY TO RETURN MORE THAN $10 BILLION TO PEOPLE THEY CHEATED, HAS HANDLED MORE THAN 650,000 COMPLAINTS. IT IS CHANGING THAT MARKET. AND THE JUST LEVELING IT OUT SO REAL FAMILIES HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN A FINANCIAL MARKETPLACE. THAT'S GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE CAN DO IT.
Stephen: SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH! HEY! COME ON! COME ON! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. TONIGHT'S MUSICAL GUEST IS AN AMERICAN ROCK INSTITUTION. PLEASE WELCOME PEARL JAM! EDDIE, MIKE, STONE, MAT, JEFF, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND DOING THE GLOBAL CITIZENS FESTIVAL. IS THIS THE FIRST YEAR YOU HAVE DONE IT?
FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE IT BUT SUPPORTED IT FROM THE BEGINNING. AND WE MET THE GREAT YOUNG MAN FROM EARLIER, HUGH EVANS, AN INCREDIBLE ACTIVIST, AND THE PEOPLE THAT HE WORKS WITH. THE AMOUNT OF INTELLIGENCE THAT GOES INTO HOW THEY APPROACH THESE ISSUES AND HOW THEY APPROACH CHANGE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF.
Stephen: WHY HAS ACTIVISM ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOU GUYS' MUSIC? WHAT WAS THE ISSUE YOU GUYS WERE PROTESTING? WHAT WERE YOU WORKING ON IN THE 1990s BECAUSE THINGS WERE PRETTY GOOD IN THE 90s. THE COMEFS GOOD. WE WEREN'T AT WAR FOR NINE YEARS. WHAT WAS THERE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT, FELLAS? YOU WERE YOUNG. IT'S A JUMP BALL. THIS IS FOR ANYBODY HERE.
I THINK IT GOES BACK TO WHEN WE WERE YOUNG KIDS AND PUNK ROCK MUSIC TEACHING US ABOUT CERTAIN ISSUES. WE HEARD ABOUT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL FROM PEOPLE LIKE PETER GABRIEL, STING, AND U2. IT CREATES-- THEN YOU FIND YOURSELF-- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THEN YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE YOUR MUSIC TO PERHAPS EFFECT CHANGE, AND THEN NOWADAYS, LATELY, WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER AT IT, OR WE'VE LEARNED ALONG THE ROAD THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE TANGIBLE CHANGE AND DO THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAKING YOUR TOURING BE CARBON NEUTRAL. YOU CAN FREE INNOCENT MEN FROM PRISON. YOU CAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RAISE MONEY--
