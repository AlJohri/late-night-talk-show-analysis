Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT AND THIS IS THE LATE SHOW. WELCOME TO IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW WHILE THIS IS OFFICIALLY THE LATE SHOW, I'M SURE FOR SOME OF YOU WATCHING THIS IT'S ACTUALLY THE MIDAFTERNOON ON YOUR WORK COMPUTER UNTIL YOU HEAR YOUR BOSS COMING SHOW. I'LL MAKE IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE SKYPING ABOUT WORK STUFF. I TELL YOU, MY TAKEAWAY FROM THIS MEETING IS THAT WE NEED TO CUT SPENDING ON OVERHEAD IF WE WANT TO GROW THE YIELD YEAR-TO-DATE. I NEED TO KNOW, CAN ONE OF YOU TELL ME WHO IS GOING TO HONCHO THAT EFFORTING. AGAIN, I THINK YOU'RE DOING A BANG UP JOB. YOU TOTALLY SAVED OUR BACON THIS YEAR. IT'S NO WOJDER YOU ARE BEING HEAD HUNTED SO AGGRESSIVELY. GOOD FOR YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YEAH, OKAY. IS YOUR BOSS GONE? (LAUGHTER) HE WILL TOTALLY BUY THAT. OKAY. NOW WE, FOLKS, HAVE GOT A LOVELY SHOW FOR YOU THIS EVENING. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS STEPHEN CURRY, THE REIGNING -- MVP, OMG, MVP. OF COURSE, THE FANS OF BALL AND HOOP, HE IS KNOWN FOR HIS BALL HANDLING AND ABILITY TO TAKE IT TO THE HOLE WHICH ARE PHRASES THIS NETWORK NORMALLY ONLY LETS "THE TWO BROKE GIRLS" SAY. THEN-- THEN I'LL BE TANGLING, I'LL BE PUNCHING DOINGIES WITH TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUZ. HE IS THE THIRD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I'VE HAD ON THE SHOW. I WANT TO INTERVIEW ALL OF THEM BUT I ONLY HAVE 200 SHOWS A YEAR. AND WE'LL HAVE MUSIC FROM LEDGE ENARY EAGLE AND ACTUAL HUMAN DON HENLEY. I LOVE DON HENLEY. FELLAS, THAT SOUND IS JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" SAY HI, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK THIS THING INTO HIGH GEAR IN JUST A SECOND. BUT ONE MORE THING BEFORE THEY TEAR THE DOME OFF THIS BAD MAMMA JAMMA. A NEW BIOGRAPHY CLAIMS THAT OXFORD BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON PUT HIS GENITALS INTO THE MOUTH OF A ROASTED PIG SOME IN HIS DEFENSE THAT IS STILL MORE APPEALING THAN MOST BRITISH FOOD. TONIGHT I WELCOME NBA MVP STEPHEN CURRY. SENATOR TED CRUZ. MUSICAL GUEST DON HENLEY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! YES!
OH YEAH.
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE WORLD IS SPINNING SO FAST. YOU KNOW, YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING ONE DAY AND THE NEXT DAY YOU GO, I WAS WRONG. CASE IN POINT, MY BUDDY JEB BUSH. WHEN THIS ELECTION BEGAN LIKE TWO MONTHS AGO, EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT JEB. OR RATHER JEB! BUT LIKE ALL THE OTHER REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, JEB IS STRUGGLING TO GET TRACTION AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP IS EVEN DOMINATING IN JEB'S HOME STATE OF FLORIDA WHERE THE FORMER GOVERNOR IS BEHIND BY 15 POINTS. THAT MAKES SENSE THAT FLORIDA LIKES TRUMP. I MEAN THEY'RE USED TO LIFE SIZE CARTOON CHARACTERS WITH GIANT HEADS. BUT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: DON'T TOUCH THE DONALD, KIDS. HE GETS ANGRY. BUT FIGHTING BACK NOW, AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT, IS JEB'S SUPER PAC "RIGHT TO RISE" WHOSE HAND LOGO RIGHT THERE IS AN ACCURATE COUNT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE IN FLORIDA ARE SUPPORTING JEB. THEY HAVE RELEASED A NEW AD GOING AFTER TRUMP'S NEGATIVITY.
WE LOSE EVERYWHERE.
MURDERS, CRIME, POLICING, VERY, VERY STUPID PEOPLE.
MY MESSAGE WILL BE AN OPTIMISTIC ONE BECAUSE I'M CERTAIN THAT WE CAN MAKE THE DECADES JUST AHEAD THE GREATEST TIME EVER TO BE ALIVE IN THIS WORLD. THAT CHANCE, THAT HOPE REQUIRES THE BEST THAT IS IN US. WE WILL LIFT OUR SIGHTS AGAIN. IT'S POSSIBLE. IT CAN BE DONE. EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO RISE.
Stephen: IT'S A GOOD COMMERCIAL, DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WHEN YOUR SUPER PAC DITCHES THE JEB! FOR JUST JEB. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN--  (APPLAUSE) WHAT'S NEXT? JEB? (LAUGHTER) GRANTED, THAT AD SHOWS THAT THE POWERFUL AND OPTIMISTIC VISION OF AMERICA. THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM. IT'S NOT AMERICA. IT TURNS OUT THAT VIDEO USES STOCK FOOTAGE FROM OVERSEAS. FOR INSTANCE, THIS ALL-AMERICAN FOOTAGE WAS ACTUALLY SHOT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THAT IS NOT AN AMERICAN FATHER ADJUSTING HIS SON'S BACKPACK. THAT IS A BRITISH PA-PA WILLIE KNICKERING HIS WEE SON'S RUCH-SACK. AND THIS IMAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WITH THE TITLE "AMERICA IS GREAT" IS ACTUALLY FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOTHING MORE AMERICAN THAN THINGS MADE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: EVEN THIS BEAUTIFUL SUNRISE SPREADING ACROSS AN AMBER WAVE OF AMERICAN GRAIN IS ACTUALLY A FIELD IN CORNWALL ENGLAND AT SUNRISE. IT WAS SHOT ON THAT SUNNY DAY THEY HAD THAT ONE TIME. AND IT GOES DEEPER THAN THAT, FOLKS. BECAUSE PIE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT TELL ME THAT EVEN THIS STATUE OF A GREEN TORCH LADY ACTUALLY COMES FROM FRANCE. SORRY. (APPLAUSE) I BELIEVE AMERICAN STATUES SHOULD BE MADE IN AMERICA, OR AT LEAST SOUTHEAST ASIA. (LAUGHTER) SO JEB'S NOT THE ONLY ONE, JEB! HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE STRUGGLING FOR ATTENTION. THIS CAMPAIGN SEASON ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL-- HELLO. (LAUGHTER) OH. I AM GOING TO MISS YOU THE MOST, ALL THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO WOO MILLENNIALS. I'M NOT SURE COLLEGE KIDS CAN IDENTIFY WITH 22 PEOPLE DESPERATELY FIGHTING FOR ONE JOB. NOW NO SURPRISE, THE LEADER IN THE RACE TO ATTRACT THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS HILLARY CLINTON. AFTER ALL, A CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE ULTIMATE-- ULTIMATE THROWBACK THURSDAY. PLUS--  (APPLAUSE) HILLARY HAS ALREADY RELEASED A MILLENNIAL-FRIENDLY PLAN TO HANDLE STUDENT LOAN DEBT SAYING NO STUDENT SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE OUT A LOAN TO PAY FOR TUITION IF ATTENDING A FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC COLLEGE. AMEN. PAYING OFF MY STUDENT LOAN DEBT IS THE ONLY REASON I TOOK THIS CBS GIG. 12 MORE YEARS. (APPLAUSE) BUT THE HILLS DOESN'T WANT HER CAMPAIGN TO BE SOMEONE-SIDED CONVERSATION. SHE WANTS TO HAVE A RAP SESH WITH THE YOUTH. SO HER COMMUNICATIONS TEAM DEVELOPED A TWITTER STRATEGY OR TWAGEDY TO FIND OUT WHAT STUDENTS THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ISSUE ASKING HOW DOES YOUR STUDENT LOAN DEBT MAKE YOU FEEL? TELL US IN THREE EMOJIS OR LESS. YES. BECAUSE NOTHING SHOWS RESPECT FOR COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS LIKE ASKING THEM TO SUM UP A LIFETIME OF CRUSHING DEBT IN THREE CARTOON FACES. NOW KIDS SEEM TO LIKE IT BECAUSE THE INTERNET RESPONDED WITH THOUGHTFUL THREE EMOJI CONVOS RANGES FROM@ERICA COTTEN FLYING MONEY, WAVING HAND CRYING FACE. @LINKS HUND ELOQUENT TELESCOPE, SOWMAN, PIZZA. AND@OR KID NYC WHO JUST WROTE LOL EASTER ISLAND HEAD. CLEARLY, CLEARLY SENDING THE MESSAGE SHE PREFERS THE CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY. I SAY, I SAY IF EMOJIS ARE GOOD MUFF FOR HILLARY'S FOLLOWERS, WHY SHOULDN'T SHE EMBRACE THEM. AFTER ALL SHE HAS HAD SOME PROBLEMS STATING HER CAMPAIGN POSITIONS WITH MERE WORDS.
AS PRESIDENT, WOULD YOU SIGN A BILL, YES OR NO, PLEASE, IN FAVOR OF ALLOWING THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE.
THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DECISION. AND I'M TO THE GOING TO SECOND-GUESS HIM BECAUSE I WAS IN A POSITION TO SET THIS IN MOTION. AND I DO NOT THINK THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SO I WANT TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE AND SECRETARY KERRY DECIDE. IF IT'S UNDECIDED WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT, I WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.
Stephen: WELL, THERE IT IS. YOU GOT TO VOTE FOR HILLARY NOW BECAUSE APPARENTLY ELECTING HER PRESIDENT IS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE BELIEVES. IN FACT--  (APPLAUSE)  IN FACT, I CAN SEE HER STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS RIGHT NOW. AMERICA STRONG, DANCE, DANCE, DANCE. WELL THUMBED MADAME PRESIDENT, WELL THUMBED. STICK AROUND FOR STEPHEN CURRY AND SENATOR TED CRUZ. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY PANDORA. THE NEXT SONG MATTERS.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! WHOOO! FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO ME HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO ON THE INTERNET THESE DAYS. BEFORE INSTAGRAM YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR BRUNCH DOOR-TO-DOOR TO FIND OUT IF YOUR FRIENDS LIKED IT. BUT THE INTERNET CAN BE A DANGEROUS PLACE. LIKE THOSE TEN SIMPLE WAYS TO LOSE BELLY FAT? IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE TENTH WAY IS, MURDER. FOR INSTANCE, THERE ARE A LOT OF ON-LINE COLLEGES OUT THERE BUT YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL. BECAUSE AS WISE AS IT SEEMS TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE THE SAME WAY YOU ORDER SHOES, SOME ON-LINE UNIVERSITIES ARE ACTUALLY A SCAM.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS ON FAKE DIPLOMAS SOLD FOR CASH BY COMPANIES IN PAKISTAN. THE BUSINESS NAME AXACT CLAIMS TO BE PAKISTAN'S LARGEST SELF-EXPORTER. RECORD SHOWS ITS MAIN BUSINESS IS SELLING FAKE ACADEMIC DEGREES ON THE INTERNET.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THE PAKISTANI COMPANY AXACT WAS SELLING FAKE COLLEGE DIPLOMAS WHICH EXPLAINS WHERE BIN LADEN GOT HIS DEGREE IN WOMEN'S STUDIES. APPARENTLY--  (APPLAUSE) APPARENTLY THE COMPANY DUPED POTENTIAL STUDENTS BY BUILDING SLEEK WEB SITES FOR SCHOOLS WITH AUTHORITATIVE SOUNDING NAME LIKE BARKLEY, COLUMBIANA AND MOUNT LINCOLN. WHAT? MOUNT LINCOLN IS FAKE? THEN WHERE DID MY PARENTS SEND MY DOG BARKLEY. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HE WASN'T QUALIFIED FOR COLLEGE. HE GOT A 12 ON THINKS ACTs. AXACT EVEN SET UP A SCHOOL NAMED, AND THIS IS TRUE, NIXON UNIVERSITY. POPULAR MAJORS INCLUDE PARANOIA, ENEMY LISTING AND JOWL MANAGEMENT. AND-- DEGREES FROM AXACT AREN'T AXE-ACTLY CHEAP THIS HE ARE CHARGING OVER $4,000 FOR A DOCTORAL DEGREE. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. YOU CAN'T BUY A DOCTORATE. YOU HAVE TO EARN IT BY TELLING JOKES TO THE GRADE YATE. (APPLAUSE) -- GRADUATE. AND AX ACT WASN'T JUST OVERCHARGING PEOPLE FOR FAKE DEGREES. THEY ALSO HAD AGENTS IMPERSONATE AMERICAN OFFICIALS WHO BULLIED CUSTOMERS INTO BUYING CERTIFICATES SIGNED BY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY, PROVING ONCE AGAIN THAT YOU HAVE TO ACTIVELY THREATEN SOMEONE TO HAVE THEM WANT JOHN KERRY'S AUTOGRAPH. LUCKILY PAKISTANI AUTHORITIES ARRESTED ITS AXACT C.E.O. CHARGING HIM WITH ILLEGAL MONEY TRANSFERS, FORGERY AND FRAUD. NO DOUBT HE'LL REPRESENT HIMSELF IN COURT. I HEAR HE'S GOT LIKE 20 LAW DEGREES. WELL, I FOR ONE AM GLAD THEY CAUGHT THE GUY, CHARGING PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR FAKE DEGREES IS APPALLING AM I BELIEVE THE FAKE COLLEGE SHOULD BE FREE. THAT'S WHY I SET UP MY OWN NETWORK OF COMPLETELY FREE DIPLOMA GENERATORS. OFFERING DEGREES FROM SUCH PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AS PRANCETOWN, NOTTER DAMN, MOUNT HOLY SMOKES, STANDFORD AND SON, SKIDMARKS, JOHN HOTPANTS, AND ARIZONA STATE. (APPLAUSE) JUST GO TO COLE COLE BERTH LATE SHOW.COM, CLICK THE SCHOOL OF YOUR CHOICE AND TAKE YOUR FINAL EXAM WHICH CONSISTS OF SCROLLING DOWN THE ENTIRE PAGE AND READING THE WORD "PRINT" CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'VE NOW RECEIVED BOTH YOUR Ph.D AND YOUR PDF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH STEPHEN CURRY.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS NAMED THE NBA'S MOST VALUABLE PLAYER OF 2015, AND LEAD THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS TO THEIR FIRST NBA CHAMPIONSHIP IN 40 YEARS. PLEASE WELCOME STEPHEN CURRY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THEY WERE CHANTING. THEY WERE CHANTING MVP EARLIER.
FOR YOU?
NO, THEY WERE DOING IT FOR YOU. I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR ME AND THEN I FOUND OUT IT WAS AFTER I SAID YOUR NAME AND I FOUND IT DISTURBING.
SORRY.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE HAD A HELL OF A COUPLE OF YEARS, MAN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: AS I SAID YOU LEAD THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP. YOU WON THE BEST MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR. JUST 27 YEARS OLD. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY CALLING YOU ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTERS OF ALL TIME. AND YET YOU LIVE A FAIRLY HUMBLE LIFESTYLE. HOW BIG IS YOUR POSE? GIVE ME A ROUND NUMBER.
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH FOUR.
Stephen: FOUR.
FOUR.
Stephen: ALL I SAW BACKSTAGE WAS YOU AND YOUR WIFE. WHERE YOU HIDING THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE.
THEY'RE AT THE HOTEL, MY TWO DAUGHTERS.
Stephen: THAT'S YOUR WHOLE POSSE? THAT'S NOT BAD, THAT'S NOT BAD.
THERE'S TOUGH TO DEAL WITH SO WE HAVE --
KIDS ARE SMALL BUT RELENTLESS O UPON BES. HAS ANYONE EVER CALLED YOU THE IBMER OF BASKETBALL?
NO-- UBER OF BASKETBALL.
NO, THAT IS THE FIRST TIME.
Stephen: I'M ABOUT TO DO IT, I WILL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDUSTRY DISRUPTER.
OKAY.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT THIS MODEL ON OUR HEAD THAT BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE THESE BEHEMOTHS WHO HAVE TO GRIND THEIR WAY IN AND DRIVE TO THE HOOP. BUT YOU ARE HAPPY TO STAND OUT AT 30 FEET AND JUST KEEP DRAINING THEM OUT THERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK YOU'RE CHANGING THE WAY, DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CHANGING THE WAY THE GAME IS BEING PLAYED?
YEAH. I MEAN YOU SAW THE WAY OUR TEAM WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP. IT WAS --
VERY WELL, YOU WON VERY WELL.
BASED ON SMALL-- I'M PART OF THAT CATEGORY. SO YEAH, WE SHOOT, WE SPREAD THE FLOOR, DO IT FROM THE OUTSIDE, INSIDE. I MEAN IT'S A NEW WAY TO DO IT BUT THAT'S ONE OF MY STRENGTHS. I GOT TO DO IT OR ELSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE IN THE LEG.
Stephen: YOU GOT TO GO WITH WHAT YOU KNOW.
YOU GOT TO GO WITH WHAT I KNOW.
Stephen: YOU'VE ALSO GOT THIS NEW GAME HERE. IT'S CALLED NBA 2K 16. CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THAT. RIGHT THERE. DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?
I HAVEN'T PLAYED THE NEWEST GAME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RUSH PERFECTION. IT'S ABOUT TO COME OUT NEXT WEEK.
Stephen: THIS COMES OUT NEXT WEEK.
BUT ALL THE OTHER PREVIOUS YEARS I'VE DEFINITELY PLAYED IT.
Stephen: DO PLAYERS CHECK THEIR OWN RANKINGS ON THIS?
FOR SURE.
Stephen: DO YOU ALWAYS PLAY YOURSELF WHEN YOU PLAY IT OR DO YOU PLAY OTHER PEOPLE SO YOU CAN KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE BEATEN BY YOU?
NO, I'M-- I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. I-- I'M ALWAYS A WARRIOR, PLAY WITH MYSELF. I RUN THE SAME PLAYS.
Stephen: YOU CAN DO THAT NOW. DID YOU SAY YOU ALWAYS PLAY WITH YOURSELF? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU'RE YOUR DAD PLAYED PRO BALL BUT YOUR MOM ALSO ALSO HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN DRIVING YOU AND TRAINING YOU. I UNDERSTAND SHE'S GOT AN INTERESTING WAY OF MOTIVATING YOU TO PLAY A BETTER GAME.
SHE DOES. WE HAVE A LITTLE BET ABOUT TURNOVERS. SO SHE LIKES TO, YOU KNOW, BE A COACH SO WHEN I'M OUT THERE ON THE FLOOR I GET TWO TURNOVERS A GAME. THAT IS MY ALLOTMENT. IF I GO OVER TWO TURNOVERS, I OWE HER $100.
Stephen: FOR EVERY TURNOVER.
EVERY TURNOVER, OVER TWO. SO I AVERAGED 3.1 TURNOVERS, MULTIPLY THAT BY 82, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY, SIR. SO --
DID SHE BUY HERSELF SOMETHING NICE.
MOM WINS ALWAYS BUT --
THAT MUST FEEL PRETTY GOOD. YOU SAY I DIDN'T PLAY THE BEST GAME BUT I DID SOMETHING NICE FOR MY MOM.
EXACTLY. NEVER A BAD DAY, RIGHT, NEVER A BAD DAY.
Stephen: YOU ALSO DO THIS NICE THING WHERE YOU HAVE A NOTHING BUT NET NONPROFIT. YOU DONATE THREE MOSQUITO NETS FOR EVERY THREE POINTER YOU DROP.
I DO.
Stephen: OKAY.
PART OF THE U.N. FOUNDATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SUPPORTING THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA. SO A NICE CAMPAIGN, I HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF THAT CAUSE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. EVERY TIME A GET A THREE, I DONATE THREE NETS AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO FOLLOW ALONG AND MATCH THE DONATION. I HAVE BEEN SHOOTING REALLY WELL THE LAST THREE YEARS.
Stephen: YEAH. CUZ IF YOU MISS, BECAUSE THE DANGER IS IF YOU MISS PEOPLE AT HOME GOES HE DOESN'T CARE. I GUESS HE'S NOT A NICE GUY AFTER ALL. IN CHINA YOU WERE RECENTLY OVER THERE ON A WORLD TOUR. AND YOU PLAYED A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND YOU LOST.
CORRECT.
Stephen: OKAY. YOU KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING THE DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUT IN HIS SPEECH, RIGHT.
THAT IS WHAT I HAVE HER.
Stephen: CHINA IS BEATING OUR NBA PLAYERS. THAT'S IN THE SPEECH. YOU HUNG OUT WITH THE PRESIDENT A LITTLE BIT, WAS THAT DOOL?
IT WAS, HE WAS AT MARTHA'S VINEYARD PLAYING GOLF ON HIS VACATION. I GOT TO GO.
Stephen: HE DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY BASKETBALL WITH YOU?
HE DIDN'T. I WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE DURING FEBRUARY, IT WAS SNOWING OUTSIDE. SO HE GOT A RAIN CHECK ON THAT. BUT HE SWITCHED TO GOLF. SO.
Stephen: DID YOU WIN.
I WON HEAD UP. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL WHAT HIS SCORE WAS APPARENTLY SO I WILL KEEP THAT QUIET. BUT HIM AND HIS PARTNER RAY ALLEN BEAT ME AND MY DAD. IT WAS MY FAULT. I TRIPLE BOGEYED THE LAST HOLE. I DID IT ON PURPOSE BUT-- .
Stephen: WHICH WAS MORE HUMILIATING, LOSSING TO THE PRESIDENT OR A 12-YEAR-OLD CHINESE GIRL?
GOT TO GO WITH THE 12-YEAR-OLD. GOT TO GO WITH THE 12-YEAR-OLD.
Stephen: NOW I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE HERE. BUT I DO HAVE A BEEF WITH YOU.
OKAY.
Stephen: AND THAT IS YOU ARE STEPHEN AND I'M STEPHEN BUT WE SPELL OUR NAMES THE SAME WAY, THE ONLY WAY TO SPELL IT. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU TYPE IN S-T-E-P-H-E-N. INTO GOOGLE SEARCH, THE NUMBER ONE ANSWER IS NOT ME. THE NUMBER ONE ANSWER IS YOU. OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT USED TO GO YOU, STEPHEN HAWKING AND THEN ME.
OKAY.
Stephen: I WAS SUCKING HIS EXHAUSES FOR YEARS. BUT NOW I BUMPED UP TO NUMBER TWO AND I NEED-- I NEED US TO SET WHOLE IS THE STEPHEN OF STEPHENS HERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: I HAVE A CHALLENGE FOR YOU, OKAY. I WANT US TO PLAY A LITTLE GAME. I DON'T PLAY BASKETBALL, OKAY. BUT I DO DRAIN THEM FROM A DISTANCE WHEN I'M PUTTING MY LAUNDRY AWAY, ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS-- I WANT TO YOU IMAGINE THAT WE'RE ROOMMATES IN COLLEGE.
OKAY.
Stephen: AND WE BOTH GOT LAUNDRY BAGS.
OKAY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU GOT THE BLUE SOCKS, THESE ARE YOURS, THESE ARE YOURS. THAT MAKES SENSE. THERE YOU GO. HERE'S THE DEAL. OUR MOMS ARE COMING TO VISIT.
OKAY.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT? WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR DIRTY LAWN REE OFF THE FLOOR AND INTO THE HAMPER DOWN THERE. WE CANNOT LEAVE THE RISER UP HERE, OKAY? 30 SECONDS ON THE CLOCK, 30 SECRETARIES ON THE CLOCK, ALL RIGHT. AND WE'LL SETTLE TO SEE WHO SHOULD BE NUMBER ONE ON GOOGLE SEARCH. ASK IT A DEAL.
IN IS A DEAL.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. AND GO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FIRST ONE. OH.
OH! OH! OH!
OH!
Stephen: ALL RIGHT, SUDDEN DEATH, SUDDEN DEATH, HERE WE GO. FROM A DISTANCE.
I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: NBA 2K16, SEPTEMBER 29th, STEPHEN CURRY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A FIRST TERM SENATOR, HAS AN IMMIGRANT FATHER AND EASE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. NO, NOT WHO RAN IN 2008, IT'S SENATOR TED CRUZ. SENATOR CRUZ, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU ARE A VERY BUSY MAN. YOU GREW UP IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.
YP.
Stephen: YOU STUDIED AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, SMARTIE PANTS. AND YOU SERVED AS AN ADVISOR ON THE 2000 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF GEORGE W. BUSH. YOU WON ELECTION TO THE SENATE IN 2012. AND NOW YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. YOU WERE THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO JUMP IN AND TO DECLARE. NOW THERE'S 16 OTHER GUYS WHO DID THAT, OKAY. DID YOU KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE JUMPING IN THE POOL WITH YOU?
I DID. THEY ALL LET ME KNOW BEFOREHAND.
Stephen: UH-HUH. WERE YOU SURPRISED HOW CROWDED THE FIELD GOT?
THERE ARE ANOTHER DOZEN COMING.
Stephen: REALLY? ALL RIGHT.
IN FACT, STEPHEN, ARE YOU GOING TO ANNOUNCE TONIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT, I ACTUALLY RAN--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I RAN --
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I RAN FOR PRESIDENT FAKE TWICE, OKAY. I FOUND THAT EXHAUSTING EVEN TO PRETEND TO DO IT FOR LIKE THREE WEEKS. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO ACTUALLY RUN FOR PRESIDENT. WHAT ARE THE DAYS LIKE?
NEVER ENDING.
Stephen: YEAH?
IT IS-- IT'S EXHILARATING. YOU ARE ON THE ROAD CONSTANTLY. YOU KNOW, I'VE JOKED WITH MY DAUGHTER CAROLINE WHO IS 7, KATHRYN IS 4, I SAID RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS REAL SIMPLE. YOU JUST HAVE TO SURGICALLY DISCONNECT YOUR SHAME SENSOR BECAUSE YOU SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT ASKING PEOPLE FOR MONEY. YOU WALK UP TO TOTAL STRANGERS, YOU GO HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING? CAN I HAVE MONEY, THAT'S A LOVELY TIE, PLEASE GIVE ME MONEY. THAT IS POLITICS IN A NUTSHELL.
Stephen: NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M SURE PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND SAY HOW DID THE PHONE CALLS GO TODAY. HOW MANY HOURS ON THE PHONE WERE YOU TODAY? I MEAN, I HAVE HELPED PEOPLE RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. AND I WAS SURPRISED HOW OFTEN THAT'S WHAT THEY GET ASKED, NOT WHAT THEIR POLICY POSITIONS ARE.
WELL, IT IS RELENTLESS BUT I TELL YOU T IS INVIGORATING. I'M LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE. I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN BECAUSE --
WHO'S PAYING FOR THE CANDY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, THE REASON I'M HAVING SO MUCH FUN IS PEOPLE ARE ENERGIZED. WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND IS PHENOMENAL. SO FOR EXAMPLE, WHO IS PAYING FOR THE CANDY? OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF ALL OF THE CANDIDATES IN THE FIELD, OUR CAMPAIGN RAISED MORE MONEY THAN ANY OTHER CAMPAIGN BECAUSE WE HAD OVER 175,000 CONTRIBUTIONS. THAT IS INVIGORATING. WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE, THEY'RE HUNGRY FOR CHANGE. THEY RECOGNIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T WORKING. AND SO I COME HOME. I COME HOME EXCITED BECAUSE I SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST READY TO GET BACK TO A BOOMING ECONOMY. YOU KNOW, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME OUT OF SCHOOL AND HAVE JOB OPPORTUNITIES. THEY WANT TO HAVE A FUTURE. AND THEY'RE TIRED OF THE STAGNATION WE'VE BEEN IN. AND THAT'S INSPIRING.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF, WHAT'S THE NAME, DONALD TRUMP?
I'VE HEARD OF HIM.
Stephen: HE'S MY GUEST TOMORROW NIGHT. IS THERE A QUESTION YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK HIM? BECAUSE I WILL. IF YOU GIVE ME A QUESTION YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ASK MR. TRUMP, I WILL ASK HIM TOMORROW NIGHT.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT HE'S RICH.
Stephen: OKAY. $10 BILLION, AS RICHES YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE. HE WISHES HE COULD TELL YOU HOW RICH HE WAS.
WELL, LOOK, I LIKE DONALD A LOT. AND IF YOU COULD ASK HIM IF HE WOULD POSSIBLY CONSIDER DONATING 1 BILLION TO OUR CAMPAIGN.
Stephen: I'LL WRITE THAT DOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CAN YOU STICK AROUND BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A FEW MORE THINGS.
SURE.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE SENATOR TED CRUZ.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR TED CRUZ. THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. IF SOMEONE OUT THERE IS WATCHING THIS SHOW, YOU'RE QUITE CONSERVATIVE. IF THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO IS NOT A VERY CONSERVATIVE VOTER, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HOW WOULD YOU WELCOME THOSE PEOPLE INTO YOUR ADMINISTRATION OR HOW WOULD YOU REPRESENT THEM? CONVINCE THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE NOT FAR RIGHT WHY YOU SHOULD BE SOMEONE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER TO VOTE FOR SHOULD YOU GET THE NOMINATION.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IN THE LAST 50 YEARS, THERE IS ONE REPUBLICAN WHO HAS A GROUP OF DEMOCRATS NAMED AFTER HIM. REAGAN DEMOCRATS.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
THOSE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T COME OVER BECAUSE REAGAN WAS THE SQUISHIEST MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CANDIDATE. THEY CAME OVER BECAUSE HE REPRESENTED PRINCIPLESES THAT WERE APPEALING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASE OF OUR SUPPORT, IT IS THE REAGAN DEMOCRATS. IT IS WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. YOU KNOW, I WAS IN YOUR HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. YOUNG WOMAN CAME UP TO ME THERE. SHE SAID IN 2008 I VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA. IN 2012 I STAYED HOME, IN 2016 I'M VOTING FOR YOU. IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA, AN OLDER MAN.
Stephen: DOES SHE HAVE A NAME, DOES THIS PERSON HAVE A NAME? GOING TO FACT CHECK THAT ONE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. LET ME ASK ABOUT REAGAN FOR A SECOND. DEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW, AND REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD REASONS WHY THEY LIKE RONALD REAGAN. BUT DOES TODAY A MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY REFLECT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT REAGAN DID. REAGAN RAISED TAXES, OKAY. REAGAN ACTUALLY HAD A AMNESTY PROGRAMMING FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS WOULD ALLOW REAGAN TO BE NOMINATED TODAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO TO WHAT LEVEL CAN YOU WHEN YOU SAY YOU EMULATE WRONG ALD REAGAN, THAT WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN HE WAS WILLING TO WORK WITH TIP O'NEILL TO GET THINGS DONE. ISN'T THAT WHAT PEOPLE WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IS NOT JUST PRINCIPLESES BACK?
WELL, I TELL YOU, NUMBER ONE AS I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE SAYING THE THING WE WANT OF REPUBLICANS IS TO GIVE IN MORE TO BARACK OBAMA AND THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING. I DON'T HEAR THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Stephen: BUT ARE THOSE ASPECTS OF REAGAN SOMETHING YOU COULD AGREE WITH?
RAISING TAXES AND AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. COULD YOU AGREE WITH REAGAN ON THOSE TWO THINGS?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
BUT RONALD REAGAN ALSO SIGNED THE LARGEST TAX CUT IN HISTORY. HE REDUCED GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS FROM WASHINGTON.
Stephen: HE DID.
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPLODED. YOU KNOW, WHEN REAGAN CAME IN, FROM 1978 TO 1982 ECONOMIC GROWTH AVERAGED LESS THAN 1 PERCENT A YEAR. THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER FOUR-YEAR PERIOD WHERE THAT IS TRUE. THAT IS TRUE FROM 2008 TO 2012 AND WHAT REAGAN DID, HE CUT TAXES. HE CUT REGULATIONS, HE UNCHAINED SMALL BUSINESSES, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH BOOMED. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WERE LIFTED OUT OF POVERTY AND PROSPERITY IN THE MIDDLE CLASS.
Stephen: BUT WHEN CONDITIONS CHANGED IN THE COUNTRY, HE REVERSED HIS WORLD'S LARGEST TAX CUT AND RAISED TAXES WHEN REVENUES DID NOT MATCH THE EXPECTATIONS. SO IT IS A MATTER OF COMPROMISING. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WILL YOU BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE WITH THE OTHER SIDE? BECAUSE I WILL SAY THAT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT YOUR PLAN MIGHT BE THE RIGHT ONE IF IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THE RIGHT ONE, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE WITH THE OTHER SIDE, CHANGE YOUR MIND AND DO SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER SIDE WANTS. AND NOT FEEL LIKE YOU CAPITULATED WITH THE DEVIL.
SO MY ATTITUDE,.
Stephen: IS IT POSSIBLE. BECAUSE YOU'RE A RELIGIOUS MAN. YOU'RE A RELIGIOUS MAN. AND I DABBLE. WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO CALL THE OTHER SIDE THE DEVIL?
ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NOTHING DIABOLICAL ABOUT YOU.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT EURO UPON EPTS POLITICALLY, ARE THEY DIABOLICAL.
OF COURSE NOT. AND MY RESPONSE IN POLITICS IS WHEN OTHERS THROW ROCKS AT INSULT, I DON'T RESPOND IN KIND. AND IN FACT --
THAT'S TRUE. YOU HAVEN'T.
THAT'S TRUE OF BOTH REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS AM WHEN OTHERS ATTACK ME, I MAKE A POINT ON KEEPING THE FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE. KEEPING THE FOCUS ON HOW DO WE TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND. PEOPLE ARE FED UP. WHAT THEY WANT IS JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. AND YOU KNOW, YOU MENTIONED BEFORE, YOU KNOW, YOU SAY CRUZ YOU ARE A VERY CONSERVATIVE GUY. LISTEN, WHAT I AM FIGHTING FOR ARE SIMPLE PRINCIPLESES, LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS, STOP BANKRUPTING OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION.
Stephen: AND NO GAY MARRIAGE, AND NO GAY MARRIAGE.
NO, ACTUALLY, LET'S BE PRECISE. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, MARRIAGE IS A QUESTION FOR THE STATES. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE MARRIAGE LAW.
Stephen: IT DOESN'T MENTION MARRIAGE IN THE CONSTITUTION.
WE HAVE HAD A COUNTRY FOR OVER 200 YEARS. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: YOU MAY BE RIGHT, YOU MAY BE RIGHT BUT IT DOESN'T MENTION MARRIAGE IN THE CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY IT IS A QUESTION FOR THE STATE,. BECAUSE THE 10th AMENDMENT SAYS IF IT DOESN'T MENTION IT, IT'S A QUESTION FOR THE STATES. THAT'S IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS. EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT MENTIONED IS LEFT TO THE STATES SO IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE MARRIAGE LAWS --
I'M ASKING WHAT YOU WANT.
I BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY. I BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD-- NO, NO, GUYS, GUYS, HOWEVER YOU FEEL, HE'S MY GUEST, SO PLEASE DON'T BOO HIM.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ENTRUST GOVERNING OUR SOCIETY TO FIVE UNELECTED LAWYERS IN WASHINGTON. WHY WOULD YOU POSSIBLY HANOVER THE RIGHTS OF 320 MILLION AMERICANS TO FIVE LAWYERS IN WASHINGTON TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DECIDE THE RULES THAT GOVERN YOU. IF YOU WANT TO WIN AN ISSUE, GO TO THE BALLOT BOX AND WIN AT THE BALLOT BOX. THAT'S THE WAY THE CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED.
Stephen: WELL, SENATOR CRUZ, I REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR SHARING YOUR VIEWS WITH US. AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE CAMPAIGN.
WELL, THANK YOU.
Stephen: .
Stephen: SENATOR TED CRUZ IS A CANDIDATE FOR THE 2016 GOP NOMINATION. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
