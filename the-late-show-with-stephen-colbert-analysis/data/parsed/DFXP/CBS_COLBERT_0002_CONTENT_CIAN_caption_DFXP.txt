Stephen: WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S LOVELY. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT'S SO NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, PLEASE. SIT DOWN! THANK YOU, PLEASE. YOU'RE VERY KIND. YOU'RE VERY KIND. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. WE PAID FOR NEW CHAIRS. THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE. USE THEM. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN LATE. THE SHOW PREMIERED LAST NIGHT, AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY WE MADE IT TO DAY TWO, EVERYBODY. TWO, TWO. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS GREAT, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN MY HEALTH INSURANCE KICKS IN, AND I ALMOST NEEDED A HEART TRANSPLANT LAST NIGHT. BECAUSE A FUN THING HAPPENED AND I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY TRUE STORY I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU. THE SHOW ALMOST DIDN'T GET ON THE AIR LAST NIGHT. IT WAS A LITTLE LONG. IT WAS A DOUBLE-STUFFED OREO, STUFFED WITH OTHER OREOS. YOU KNOW FOR A SHOW YOU WANT TO DO A LOT. WE HAD TO CUT SOME STUFF WE LOVED. DEFINITELY GO TO www.colbertlateshow.com, CHECK OUT JEB BUSH DOING HIS BEST DONALD TRUMP IMPRESSION. IT'S GREAT. IT MAKES HIM SEEM SIMULTANEOUSLY MORE ELECTABLE AND LESS PRESIDENTIAL. IT'S WORTH THE TRIP. I PROMISE YOU, IT'S WORTH THE TRIP. IT WAS FUN. I'M VERY GRATEFUL THE GOVERNOR CAME ON LAST NIGHT. SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY. POSSIBLE I WOULD VOTE FOR HIM. GO TO THE WEB SITE, AND SEE SOME FOOTAGE I HAD 2 CUT ABOUT ME AND GEORGE CLOONEY TALKING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS I HAVE LAILINGSES AND THE NIPPLES ON HIS BATMAN COSTUME. BOTH CONVERSATIONS VERY UNSETTLING. HERE'S THE THING. IT TOOK US A WHILE TO CUT THE SHOW DOWN TO TIME, AND WHEN WE TRIED TO SEND IT TO THE NETWORK SO THEY COULD SHOW IT TO YOU ON AIR, THE COMPUTERS KEPT CRASHING. YEAH, YEAH. LAUGH YEAH, AND AGAIN, 11:20, AND, AGAIN, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED. NO ONE IN THE BUILDING COULD GIVE ME A GUARANTEE FOR CERTAIN THAT THE SHOW WAS GOING TO GO ON THE AIR LAST NIGHT. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITING THAT WAS FOR ALL OF US. AFTER CBS HAD PLASTERED MY FACE ON NEARLY EVERY FLAT SURFACE ON THE PLANET, OKAY. THIS-- THIS-- THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE, BUT THE POPE ACTUALLY IS TATTOOED WITH MY FACE, ALL RIGHT. THE POPE HAS A TRAMP STAMP OF MY FACE RIGHT HERE. THAT'S HOW GOOD CBS' MARKETING HAS BEEN. AND AFTER ALL THAT, MAYBE WE WOULDN'T GO ON THE AIR. AND AS I FELT THE OXYGEN BEGIN TO DRAIN FROM MY BRAIN AND ALL MY ORGANS SHUTTING DOWN, I THOUGHT IF WE ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO AIR, THIS WILL BE A PRETTY GOOD STORY. AND IF WE DON'T, IT'LL STILL BE A VERY INTERESTING STORY AT THE THEATER CAMP I WILL BE RUNNING IN IDAHO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BOW! RIKAH! BUT IN THE CLUTCH-- AND I HAVE TO THANK THEM, OUR TALENTED TECH TEAM MANAGED TO GET THE SHOW OUT OF THE HARD DRIVES AND ON THE AIR. AND I'M STILL NOT SURE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, BUT IF YOU'RE SEEING THIS RIGHT NOW, IT MEANS WE FIXED IT. ANYWAY, THANKS TO THE TECH TEAM. AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE TONIGHT'S SHOW. I HOPE IT DOES PRAFT. WE'VE GOT SCARLETT JOHANSSON. SHE'S HERE. CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S HERE TONIGHT. SHE CAME HERE ALL THE WAY FROM FRANCE, SO, TO MAKE HER FEEL AT HOME, I'LL CHAIN SMOKE AND GO ON STRIKE. I'LL ALSO BE TALKING TO OLD FRIEND TESLA MOTORS AND SPACE-X C.E.O. ELON MUSK. EVERYBODY LOVES HIM. THE REAL TONY STARK. HE'S A MAN WHO IS BUILDING ELECTRIC CARS, DEVELOPING HIS OWN SPACE PROGRAM, AND IS ALSO THE GUY WHO FIRST PUT PIZZA ON A BUYINGLE. SO NOW YOU CAN HAVE PIZZA ANYMORE. ♪ ♪ ♪ FOLKS, THAT SOUND IS EITHER THE THEME SONG TO A 70s COP DRAMA OR THE "LATE SHOW" BAND JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HEY, EVERYBODY. ♪ ♪ ♪ THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY THE NEW "LATE SHOW" THEME SONG. YOU ALL WANT TO HEAR THAT. BEFORE THEY DO, ONE LAST THING, OUR MUSICAL GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GREAT KENDRICK LAMAR. HE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) KENDRICK IS GOING TO PERFORM SOME SONG OFF HIS LATEST ALBUM, "TO PIMP A BUTTERFLY." "IT," OF COURSE, IS THE SEQUEL TO HIS BELOVED CHILDREN'S BOOK, "THE VERY HORNY CATERPILLAR." TONIGHT I WELCOME SCARLETT JOHANSSON. TESLA C.E.O., ELON MUSK; KENDRICK LAMAR. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH ME, STEPHEN COLBERT!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU. NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR CHANTING MY NAME FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD HEAR THAT WAS MY ALARM CLOCK. HI, EVERYBODY. I'M SITTING OVER HERE, NOW. BEFORE, I WAS STANDING. NOW I'M SITTING. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED A VARIETY SHOW-- ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES IN WHAT MAKES A SUCCESSFUL RUP FOR THE PRESIDENT-- EXPERIENCE; POLICIES; DO THE KOCH BOTHERS LIKE YOU? OR DO THEY "LIKE" LIKE YOU? BUT THESE DAYS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN IS THE ONLINE MERCHANDISE STORE, WHERE YOU CAN BUY CANDIDATE-THEMED T-SHIRTS, MUGS AND TRUCKER CAPS. LOTS OF GREAT GIFT IDEAS FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW NAMED RAND. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CANDIDATES TO SET THEMSELVES APART WITH ONE-OF-A-KIND ITEMS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON'S "CHILLARY" DRINK KOOZIE. IT'S HER FAVORITE WAY TO KEEP A BEVERAGE COLD UNLESS POLLING INDICATES A MORE POPULAR COOLING METHOD, IN THIS CASE SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR THAT ONE FIRST. OR BERNIE SANDERS HAS A GREAT COFFEE MUG THAT SAYS, "FEEL THE BERN." WHICH-- ( APPLAUSE ) YES, FEEL THE BERN, FEEL THE BERN, WHICH SENATOR SANDERS WAS SPECIFICALLY TOLD BY H.R. NOT TO SAY TO HIS INTERNS. IT'S A SCANDAL, COULD BE A SCANDAL, IF IT WERE TRUE. AND WHO COULD RESIST THIS ACTUAL ITEM AVAILABLE ON JEB BUSH'S WEBSITE: A GUACAMOLE BOWL CALLED THE "GUACABOWLE." SURE, IT DOESN'T SAY "JEB!" ON IT, BUT WOULD YOU PUT YOUR NAME ON A $75 BOWL THAT NORMALLY SELLS FOR $9? AND CASH-STRAPPED RICK PERRY MIGHT HAVE STOPPED PAYING HIS STAFF, BUT HE CAN RAISE SOME MUCH-NEEDED FUNDS ON rickperry.org, WHERE YOU CAN BUY HATS, STICKERS, BUTTONS, CAMPAIGN OFFICE FURNITURE, A BROKEN COFFEE MAKER AND SOME GENTLY USED SMART-GUY GLASSES. EVEN BILLIONAIRE DONALD TRUMP IS FUNDING HIS CAMPAIGN WITH A MERCH STORE. WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE WHERE ELSE COULD YOU FIND SOMETHING WITH HIS NAME ON IT? AND FOLKS, WHEN YOU ORDER CAMPAIGN MERCH, YOU'RE NOT JUST BUYING USELESS CRAP, YOU'RE DOING YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY TO BUY USELESS CRAP. AS RAND PAUL SAYS OF HIS OWN ONLINE MERCHANDISE, "THOMAS JEFFERSON WOULD BE PROUD." SO MUCH BETTER THAN RAND'S ORIGINAL SLOGAN, "IMPRESS A SLAVEHOLDER!" ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) BUT-- NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT WE'RE CLAPPING FOR, BUT I WILL JOIN YOU. BUT SADLY, THERE'S A LARGE GROUP OF THE ELECTORATE THAT'S "NOT BUYING IT." I'M TALKING ABOUT THE 11% OF PRIMARY VOTERS WHO ARE STILL "UNDECIDED" POSSIBLY-- HELLO-- POSSIBLY-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE GOVERNOR IS SALTY. THEY'RE NOT BUYING IS POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CANDIDATES. OR PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CANDIDATES. AND, FOLKS, I GET IT. WHO HAS THE TIME TO OBSESS ABOUT AN EVENT A YEAR AWAY THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE A WOOKIEE? SADLY, THIS VAST SWATH OF THE ELECTORATE DOESN'T HAVE A STORE WHERE THEY CAN BUY CRAP. UNTIL TONIGHT. TONIGHT I'M INTRODUCING MY NEW ONLINE CAMPAIGN STORE, "UNDECIDED 2016." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S LOADED-- IT'S LOADED WITH GREAT STUFF FOR THE DISCRIMINATING YET INDECISIVE VOTER, LIKE THIS T-SHIRT THAT PROUDLY DECLARES "BLANK 2016!" , OF COURSE, IT'S ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU CAN'T MAKE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT ANYTHING. OR PURCHASE THIS 20-SIDED DIE WITH THE CANDIDATES' FACES ON IT. IT'S JUST LIKE D&D. YOU CAN ROLL FOR AN ORC, A WIZARD OR A MYSTICAL WOODLAND JINDAL. BETTER YET-- HELLO! BETTER YET-- I MADE HIM DISAPPEAR! CAN YOU GUESS HIS REAL NAME? YOU CAN SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO POLLSTERS WITH A CAMPAIGN BUMPER STICKER THAT PROUDLY DECLARES, "BITE ME, IT'S STILL 2016." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, PLEASE, VISIT MY STORE TODAY OR WHENEVER YOU DECIDE TO. STICK AROUND WE HAVE SCARLETT JOHANSSON AND KENDRICK LAMAR. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, THIS IS ONLY NIGHT TWO, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M SO PROUD TO BE ON CBS. THIS IS NETWORK TELEVISION, THE BIG LEAGUES. I HAVE MILLIONS MORE VIEWERS NOW. DONNIE, DEBBIE, JEREMY, DARNELL-- I DON'T HAVE TIME TO NAME THEM ALL. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. AND, FOLKS, WITH GREAT JOB COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY. I KNOW PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE LOOKING TO ME FOR STRONG LEADERSHIP, AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL PROVIDE. FOR ONE HOUR A NIGHT, FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK UNLESS FOOTBALL RUNS LONG. THAT'S A PROMISE. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, NATURALLY, I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING SOME OF YOU FEAR THAT I'LL BE CORRUPTED BY MY NEWFOUND AUTHORITY, SO LET ME ASSURE YOU, YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PROVE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE POINT IS, WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING US EACH NIGHT, TALK SHOW HOSTS ARE THE LEADERS OF OUR TIME. WE ARE TO THE 21st CENTURY WHAT CAESAR, NAPOLEON OR GENGHIS KHAN WERE TO CENTURIES PAST. OF COURSE, OUR JOBS ARE HARDER. THOSE GUYS NEVER HAD TO COMPETE WITH ADULT SWIM. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING I'M A MODERN DAY GENGHIS KHAN. IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYTHING I SAY IS ABSOLUTE LAW TO BE OBEYED UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH. UNLESS, OF COURSE, I'M WEARING A BIG FURRY HAT. ( BAND PLAYS MARTIAL MUSIC ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW THAT THIS HAT IS ON MY HEAD, I AM ENDOWED WITH UNCONDITIONAL POWER! THIS IS DUE TO ITS MAIN ATTRIBUTES-- ITS BIGNESS AND ITS FURRINESS. ANY PROCLAMATIONS I MAKE WEARING IT ARE NOW AND FOREVER LAW. LET US BEGIN. ( LOW DRUM ROLL ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HEREBY DECREE THAT ZOOLOGISTS WILL STOP CORRECTING US WHEN WE REFER TO CHIMPANZEES AS MONKEYS. THEY EAT BANANAS, THEY ARE MONKEYS. ( LAUGHTER ) LET IT BE PROCLAIMED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, NO ONE IS NOT REQUIRED TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO EVERY SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE BEFORE LEAVING A PARTY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I PROMISE, JUST LEAVE. NOBODY WILL THINK YOU WERE ABDUCTED. IF YOU WON AN OSCAR AND HAVE NOT APPEARED IN ANOTHER OSCAR-WINNING MOVIE IN TEN YEARS, YOU MUST GIVE BACK YOUR OSCAR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN ADDITION, IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE OSCAR, YOU MUST GIVE ME ONE OSCAR. ( LAUGHTER ) THOSE WHO ARE PLAYING GUITARS IN MUSICAL INSTRUMENT STORES SHALL CEASE PLAYING GUITARS IN MUSICAL INSTRUMENT STORES. WE GET IT, YOU KNOW THE INTRO TO "WISH YOU WERE HERE" BY PINK FLOYD. DOGS SHALL BE CALLED CATS, CATS SHALL BE CALLED DOGS, AND NEITHER ANIMAL WILL NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE. STARBUCKS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO SELL CDs BY ARTISTS THAT SING ABOUT COFFEE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THE MAKERS OF I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER MUST ADMIT THAT THEY KNEW DAMN WELL IT WAS NOT BUTTER ALL ALONG. IF SOMEONE GIVES YOU THE FINGER, YOU GET TO KEEP THAT FINGER. ANYONE WHO CALLS YOU "BRO" IS NOW LEGALLY YOUR BROTHER AND, THEREFORE, CAN NEVER MARRY YOUR SISTER. YOU'RE WELCOME. ( APPLAUSE ) SIZE 32 WAIST IS WHATEVER I AM WEARING!

I CAME-- I DID, I CAME FROM PARIS.
Stephen: YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE YOU CAME HERE FROM PARIS. DO I? WHY DO YOU LIVE IN PARIS? WHY DID YOU LEAVE UNITED STATES? ARE YOU RUNNING FROM THE LAW? WHAT IS IT ABOUT PARIS? WHY DO YOU LOVE IT THERE?
I LOVE IT BECAUSE I JUST THINK IT'S-- YOU KNOW, IT'S A-- WHY NOT IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Stephen: IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY. NEW YORK IS A BEAUTIFUL CITY, TOO.
YES, NEW YORK IS A BEAUTIFUL CITY.
Stephen: IT'S NOT A CONTEST.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE NEW YORK. I HAVEN'T LEFT. I HAVEN'T LEFT.
Stephen: YOU DON'T LIVE HERE. YOU DON'T LIVE HERE.
I DO, I LIVE HERE. STOP IT!
Stephen: I APOLOGIZE. YOU'RE THE GUEST, PLEASE, GO AHEAD.
YES, WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS THAT-- NO, PARIS IS BEAUTIFUL, AND I-- THERE'S NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY THEY DON'T WALK DOWN THE STREET SAYING, "WOW, THIS IS SUCH AN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL PLACE." MY HUSBAND IS FRENCH, SO HIS FAMILY IS THERE.
Stephen: REALLY, DO YOU PARLAIS THE FRANCIS OUI, OUI, MADAME. ( SPEAKING FRENCH ) MUCH BETTER THAN I DO. ARE YOU LEARNING? YOU HAVE TO LEARN, RIGHT?
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS. I'M LEARNING. YES, I AM.
Stephen: YOUR HUSBAND SPEAKS ENGLISH, I HOPE?
YES, HE DOES.
Stephen: BECAUSE I WOULD LEARN FRENCH JUST TO LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU'RE MARRIED NOW.
NO, HE IS-- HE'S BEEN ENCOURAGING ME TO LEARN FRENCH. AND I HAVE BEEN, ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY YOU WANT TO SPEAK WHATEVER LANGUAGE IS EASIEST TO, YOU KNOW, GET YOUR IDEAS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO YOU CAN ARGUE YOUR POINT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WIN. SO FOR ME, THAT'S ENGLISH.
Stephen: IS THE FASHION ANY PART OF IT? AGAIN, YOU'RE DRESSED VERY BEAUTIFULLY TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: IS THE FASHION OF PARIS A BIG DRAW FOR YOU. YOU'RE SOMETHING OF A FASHION PLATE?
I AM? WOW. I AM?
Stephen: LITTLE OLD ME, I'M JUST SCARLETT JOHANSSON. YOU WANT ME TO PUT ON A FANCY DRESS? BECAUSE YOU ARE. PEOPLE MUST ASK YOU TO WEAR THEIR CLOTHES ALL THE TIME.
"WEAR THESE! TAKE MY CLOTHES."
Stephen: PLEASE WE WANT TO START A NEW TREND. PLEASE START WEARING A HAT ON YOUR HAND, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S CALLED A HAND HAT. IF YOU DO IT, EVERYONE WILL DO IT. HOW IS MY FRENCH, BY THE WAY? IS IT A GOOD FRENCH ACCENT?
NO, IT'S TERRIBLE. BUT VERY CHARMING, VERY CHARMING.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
WAIT, I GOT LOST IN HAND HAT. WHERE WAS I.
Stephen: I THINK YOU GOT LOST IN TRANSLATION, IS WHAT HAPPENED THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
NO, I-- YOU KNOW, YEAH, I GUESS-- FRENCH WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE FASHIONABLE THAN I WOULD EVER PROFESS TO BE OR BECOME. THEY'VE GOT IT ALL DOWN. THEY CAN STRIDE THIS THEIR HEELS.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A PRETTY GLAMULOUS LIFESTYLE, THOUGH?
I GUESS ON, YOU KNOW, ON THE SURFACE IS APPEARS PRETTY GLAMOROUS.
Stephen: I JETTED IN FROM PARIS TO NEW YORK TO DO A TELEVISION SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU ALSO-- THIS IS WHAT--
I HAD A LONG LAYOVER BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS--
Stephen: I WAS AT THE CINABON FOR A LONG TIME.
I WAS STUCK IN HUDSON NEWS.
Stephen: YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR, MODEL, SINGER, SUPER HERO-- ARE YOU TRYING TO USE UP ALL THE THINGS PEOPLE WANT TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP. IS NEXT FIREFIGHTER PRINCESS? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE. YOU'RE A MUSICIAN AS WELL.
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A DERMATOLOGIST, BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.
Stephen: WOW. YOU'RE SHOOTING BIG. ( LAUGHTER ) I UNDERSTAND MY NEX GUEST, ELON MUSK, YOU KNOW HIM?
I DO.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM? DO YOU COLLECT REALLY SPECIAL PEOPLE? HE'S IRON MAN.
DO YOU WANT TO GET ON BOARD.
Stephen: PUT ME ON MY DANCE CARD.
I KNOW HIM BECAUSE WE DID "IRON MAN 2" TOGETHER-- OR HE HAD KIND A MOMENT IN "IRON MAN 2."
Stephen: THEY SAY HE'S THE REAL TONY STARK.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. AND HE LET US USE SPACE-X, HIS FACILITY, WHICH WAS INCREDIBLE, AND I JUST WAS FASCINATED BY THE MANNED BEHIND ALL OF THAT, SPACE-X AND TESLA, AND THE MAN, THE MIND, ALL THAT STUFF. SO I ASKED IF I COULD HAVE A TOUR OF SPACE-X, AND --
DID YOU MEET HIM?
I MET HIM. HE'S A LOVELY GUY, AND VERY, VERY INTERESTING.
Stephen: AND ARE YOU HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE HE'S HERE? ARE YOU A STALKER?
I FLEW IN FROM PARIS FOR THIS. I AM SO JET LAGGED. JUST FOR ELON MUSK. YES, YES, IT'S TRUE. I CAME TONIGHT FOR YOU AND FOR ELON AND FOR ALL OF YOU AND TO SEE THIS INCREDIBLE STAGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU ONE OTHER QUESTION, BEING IN SUPER HERO MOVIES. GUYS IN THOSE MOVIES HAVE TO BE GET SUPER JACKED, SUPER LEAN CUT AND EVERYTHING TO DO THOSE MOVIES. DON'T WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD DO THAT ALL TIME? DON'T YOU ALL HAVE TO GET SUPER JACKED JUST TO GET FROYO, BECAUSE THERE'S A CAMERA ON WOMEN ALL THE TIME.
YEAH. ( APPLAUSE ) AIN'T NO THING.
Stephen: DO YOU-- DO YOU DO THAT STUFF IN YOUR MOVIES? DO YOU ACTUALLY JUMP ON PEOPLE'S SHOULDERS AND SNAP THEIR NECKS WITH YOUR THIGHS?
OH, YEAH, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE BLACK WIDOW CROTCH GRAB? I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW IT TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

YEAH.
Stephen: WE WERE TALKING BEFORE, PEOPLE ARE CALLED YOU THE REAL TONY STARK. OKAY, YOU'VE GOT YOUR FINGER IN SO MANY DIFFERENT ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. AS I SPADE SPACE-X, TESLA. NOW YOU'VE GOT SOLAR CITY AND SOLAR PACK THAT PEOPLE PUT IN THEIR HOUSES.  ( APPLAUSE ) ARE YOU SINCERELY TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD?

UH-HUH.

YEAH.
Stephen: OKAY, AND I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU GOT A NEW THING THAT YOU THINK IS-- PEOPLE ARE GOING TO UPON FOR THEIR TESLA. JIM, CAN WE SHOW FOOTAGE OF THIS? I THINK IT'S CALLED-- THIS THING IS THE POWER ARM. THAT IS AN EXTREMELY--
IT'S A SNAKE CHARGER.
Stephen: IT'S A SNAKE CHARGER THAT AUTOMATICALLY PLUGS INTO YOUR CAR WHEN YOU GET HOME.
THIS LOOKS A LITTLE WRONG. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE THE THING THAT JACKS INTO THE BACK OF NEO'S HEAD IN "THE MATRIX."
RIGHT.
Stephen: IS THAT THING GOING TO ATTACK ME IN MY SLEEP?
FOR THE PROTOTYPE, AT LEAST, I WOULD RECOMMEND NOT DROPPING ANYTHING WHEN YOU'RE NEAR IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. NOW ANOTHER THING THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IS YOU SINCERELY THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO TO MARS, THAT MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD GO TO MARS.
YEAH.
Stephen: WHY DO WE WANT TO GO TO MARS? IT'S UNINHABITABLE. YOU HAVE TOBE IN DOMES AND EVERYTHING.
INITIALLY.
Stephen: INITIALLY?
YES.
Stephen: REALLY? HOW LONG BEFORE WE CAN TURN MARS INTO SOMEPLACE WE CAN LIVE IT IS A FIXER-UPPER OF A PLANET. ( LAUGHTER ) SO AT FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE IN TRANSPARENT DOMES, BUT EVENTUALLY --
YES, WE'RE GOING TO BE HUFG EACH OTHER.
BUT EVENTUALLY YOU CAN TRANSFORM MARS INTO AN AIRCRAFT-LIKE PLANET.
Stephen: HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?
YOU WARM IT UP. JUST WARM IT UP.
Stephen: WITH A BLANKET OR-- HOW WOULD YOU WARM MARS UP? IT'S A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE SUN.
THERE'S A FAST WAY AND A SLOW WAY.
Stephen: OKAY, GIVE ME THE FAST WAY.
THE FAST WAY IS DROP THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS OVER POLES.
Stephen: YOU'RE A SUPER VILLAIN! THAT'S WHAT A SUPER VILLAIN DOES.
YEAH.
Stephen: SUPERMAN DOESN'T SAY WE'LL DROP THERMONUCLEAR BOMBS. THAT'S LEX LUTHER, MAN.
YEAH, THE SLOW WAY TO BE TO RELEASE GREENHOUSE GAS, LIKE WE'RE DOING ON EARTH. WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE RELEASING GREENHOUSE GAS S.
Stephen:  WE COULD EXPORT SOME OF OUR GREENHOUSE GASES  FROM EARTH TO MARS.
TRUE.
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE WAYS FOR US TO GET THERE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE C.E.O.s OF SPACE-X--
I'M THE C.E.O.
Stephen: YOU'RE THE C.E.O. I'M SORRY.  ( APPLAUSE ) DISPL SORRY. STRUCK A RAW NERVE. AGAIN, SUPER VILLAIN. NOW THE THING THAT EXCITES ME ABOUT SPACE-X, IS YOU WANT TO HAVE ROCKETS LIKE THE SCI-FI ROCKETS I WAS PROMISED WHEN I WAS A KID.
YEAH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY THIS IS THE KEY TO GETTING LIFE TO BE MULTIPLANETARY, TO HAVE REUSABLE ROCKETS. IF YOU THROW THE ROCKETS AWAY EVERY TIME, IT'S CRAZY EXPENSIVE TO GO TO SPACE. BUT IF YOU COULD RE-FLY THE ROCKETS IT COULD BE COMPARABLE TO AIR FLIGHTS IN ITS COST.
Stephen: AND YOU'VE GOT A ROCKET CALLED-- IT'S CALLED A FALCON?
YES.
Stephen: THE FALCON ROCKET AND YOUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO LAND THE FALCON ROCKET ON A BARGE AT SEA--
A SHIP, TECHNICALLY.
Stephen: A SHIP, I APOLOGIZE?
IT HAS ENGINES.
Stephen: EVERYTHING I SAY SEEMS TO BE INSULTING YOU THIS EVENING.
WELL, IF IT'S GOT ENGINES, IT'S A SHIP.
Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, OKAY. AND IS ANYBODY DRIVING THE SHIP?
NO, IT'S A DRONE SHIP.
Stephen: OKAY, WE HAVE A FOOTAGE OF-- THIS IS THE LAST ATTEMPT, I THINK, TO LAND THE ROCKET AFTER IT SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED A PAYLOAD. HERE IT GOES, AND-- COME ON, BABY. COME ON! YOU CAN DO IT.
IT BROKE A LEG ON LANDING SO --
IT BROKE MORE THAN THAT.
YEAH.
Stephen: OH. HOW HEARTBREAKING IS THAT TO SEE THAT WHEN YOU GET THAT CLOSE?
IT'S DEFINITELY-- DEFINITELY HEARTBREAKING.
Stephen: YEAH. YOU DON'T SEEM HEARTBROKEN.
WELL, THAT HAPPENED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. SO I THINK-- BUT-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: SHAKE IT OFF. YOU JUST SHAKE IT OFF, RIGHT.
SHAKE IT OFF. I THINK WE WERE ACTUALLY FEELING-- I MEAN, SAD BUT HAPPY AT THE SAME TIME FOR THAT BECAUSE IF WE COULD REDUCE THE LANDING VELOCITY, WE COULD GET IT TO LAND AND STAY UPRIGHT AND NOT EXPLODE. SO --
THAT IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF ROCKETS IS NOT TO EXPLODE.
YES.
Stephen: HOW LONG BEFORE THAT'S GOING TO BE SAFE ENOUGH THAT MY WIFE WOULD BE OKAY WITH ME GETTING ON A ROCKET AND GOING SOMEPLACE?
PROBABLY-- WELL, I'M NOT SURE-- I DON'T KNOW YOUR WIFE, BUT --
SHE'S RIGHT OUT THERE.
OKAY.
Stephen: YEAH.
BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF WHEN IT WILL BE SAFE ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TO TO THREE YEARS.
Stephen: YOU'RE KIDDING!
YEAH.
Stephen: THAT'S NOTHING.  ( APPLAUSE ) SERIOUSLY? SO TWO TO THREE YEARS FROM NOW, SO TWO TO THREE YEARS FROM NOW COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF. ♪ HERE'S GEORGE JETSON. ♪ HERE'S STEVE COLBERT ♪
IN APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS WE'LL BE TRANSSPORTING NASA ASTRONAUTS TO THE SPACE STATION.
Stephen: WHAT IS IS THE NEXT THING YOU WANT TO DO THAT IS A HOPEFUL FUTURE? ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO IS YOUR VISION OF THE FUTURE IS VERY HOPEFUL, THAT IT IS FIXABLE, THAT THE WORLD-- THERE'S SO MUCH DESPAIR, PEOPLE THROWING UP THEIR HANDS AT THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD THAT CAN'T BE SOLVED. YOU THINK THAT WE CAN PUT OUR MINDS TO IT AND ACTUALLY MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS CENTURY IS SUSTAINABLE ENERGY.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S IT.
