FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THANK YOU, FRANCO HARRIS, FRANCO HARRIS, FRANCO TAKING THAT TAMBORINE TO TOWN, INCREDIBLE. HEY, EVERYBODY, ANY FOOTBALL GUYS HERE, NO, OKAY, ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, LONG TIME VIEWERS OF MY SPACE KNOW THAT I DON'T PLAY A POLITICAL PUNDIT ANY MORE BUT AS AN ACKER I CAN STILL PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. WATCH THIS.
OH, MAINE STATE SENATOR AMY VOLK JUST ENDORSED CARLY FIORINA I WILL DEFINITELY REMEMBER THAT NEXT WEEK. BUT WITH ALL THE TALK ABOUT THIS RACE, IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT WE'RE STILL 14 MONTHS FROM ELECTION DAY. WHICH MEANS WE'RE JUST NINE AREAS AWAY FROM THE END OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SIR. IN FACT, A NEW CNN POLL SHOWS TRUMP IN FIRST PLACE WITH 32%, MORE THAN HIS TWO CLOSEST RIVALS COMBINED. HE'S NOW TOWERING SO HIGH IN THE POLLS HE TURNED HIS OWN BAR GRAPH INTO LUXURY CONDOES. (APPLAUSE) BUT WAS'S THE SECRET OF TRUMP'S POPULARITY. WELL, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER AND CHILD WHO WISHED TO BE A GROWN-UP ON A CURSED CARNIVAL MACHINE FRACK LUNTZ RECENTLY ASSEMBLED A 29 PERSON FOCUS GROUP OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON THAT IS TRUMP. HERE'S THE THING, NO MATTER WHAT TERRIBLE THINGS THEY TOLD THE FOCUS GROUP TRUMP HAD EVER SAID OR DONE, AND THEY DIDN'T PULL ANY PUNCHES, THEY JUST LIKED HIM MORE. TRUMP'S ENTIRE APPEAL WAS SUMMED UP BY ONE PARTICIPANT WHO EXPLAINED, WE KNOW HIS GOAL IS TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IT'S ON HIS HAT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S ON HIS HAT. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH CUZ THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL WHO PEOPLE REALLY ARE, THE HAT. THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW THAT CREEPY GUY ON THE BEACH IS A REAL FEMALE BODY INSPECTOR. FOLKS, TRUMP'S HAT HAS BECOME A STAR IN ITS OWN RIGHT IT HAS BECOME SO ICONIC THAT IN A RECENT TRUMP FUND-RAISER, GUESTS WERE SERVED THE HAT IN CAKE FORM. IT WAS A VERY RICH DESSERT THAT KEPT INSISTING IT WAS MUCH, MUCH RICHER THAN YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE. EAT MY HAT. EAT IT.  EAT THE HAT. SO I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO ALL THE OTHER-- HELLO-- ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES. SEE THIS GUY UP HERE, SEE THIS GUY, YOU, RIGHT THERE, IN THE FRONT ROW, RIGHT THERE, OKAY, I WILL GIVE YOU A $100 BILL RIGHT NOW IF YOU CAN TELL ME THAT MAN'S NAME. NOBODY HELP HER. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I WOULD HAVE TOLD THESE GUYS IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF EVER CATCHING UP WITH DONE ALL TRUMP I'M STRONGY ADVISING YOU TO EXPLAIN YOUR CAMPAIGN USING ONLY HEAD GEAR. RICK PERRY, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE FACING A FELONY INDICTMENT FOR ABUSE OF OFFICE, THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE OUT OF THE RACE. CONVEY YOUR DEEP REGRET WITH A 10 GALLON HAT EMBLAZON WDZ YOUR MOST FAMOUS QUOTE. AND IF PEOPLE OUT THERE--  (APPLAUSE) OR SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, SHOW OFF YOUR SOUTHERN PRIDE AND YOUR MIDDLE EAST POLICY WITH A FESTIVE BONNET THAT SAYS, I DO DECLARE-- WAR ON IRAN. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS A HAT THAT COMPLETELY EXPLAINS HER E-MAIL SCANDAL, UNFORTUNATELY, SHE ERASED IT. (LAUGHTER) AND SOMEBODY PUSHED THE WONG BUTTON, SHE DOESN'T, SHE DOESN'T DO THE DIGITAL THING. AND POLLING AT 0% IN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR JIM GILMORE. I WOULD RECOMMEND JUST WEARING A HAT THAT SAYS I AM JIM GILMORE. CHIRS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO CANDIDATES, TAKE MY ADVICE AND YOU TOO COULD LOOK AS PRESIDENTIAL AS THIS GUY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES, MR. JOSEPH BIDEN. THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. HE IS THE 47th VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. PLEASE WELCOME VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LOOK AT THAT.
DON'T JUMP.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. EVERYBODY LIKES JOE BIDEN, RIGHT? ISN'T THAT RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TELL YOU WHY. I'LL TELL YOU WHY I THINK THAT IS. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE WHEN WE SEE YOU, WE THINK THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING THE REAL JOE BIDEN. YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN WHO HAS CREATED SOME SORT OF FACADE TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF US OR TRY AND LATE YOUR POLITICAL POSITION OR EMOTIONAL STATE TO TRY TO MAKE US FEEL A CERTAIN WAY. WE SEE THE REAL YOU. HOW DID YOU MAINTAIN YOUR SOUL IN A CITY FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO LIE TO US IN SUBTLE WAYS? (LAUGHTER)
I COMMUTED EVERY DAY FOR 36 YEARS.
Stephen: SO GOING BACK TO DELAWARE TO GET ANOTHER PIECE OF YOUR SOUL EVERY DAY.
YES, YES. NO, LOOK, WHAT ALWAYS CONFUSES ME ABOUT SOME FOLKS I'VE WORKED WITH IS WHY "IN GOD'S NAME" WOULD YOU WANT THE JOB IF YOU COULDN'T SAY WHAT YOU BELIEVE. I'M NOT-- NOTHING NOBLE ABOUT THIS, BUT ASK YOURSELVES THE QUESTION. WOULD YOU WANT A JOB THAT, IN FACT, EVERY DAY YOU HAD TO GET UP AND YOU HAD TO MODULATE WHAT YOU SAID AND BELIEVED. IF YOU ARE'S GOING TO RUN, YOU'RE RUNNING FOR A REASON. YOU WANT THE JOB FOR A REASON. AND IF YOU CAN'T STATE WHY YOU WANT THE JOB, THEN THERE'S A LOT MORE LUCRATIVE OPPORTUNITIES OTHER PLACES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I CAN'T-- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO SPEND NINE YEARS PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY THAT YOU'RE NOT. NO. CHAERS PLAUS.
I'M GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE. I FEEL IT COMING.
Stephen: BUT MR. VICE PRESIDENT, THERE'S ANOTHER REASON I THINK THAT PEOPLE ADMIRE YOU AND LIKE YOU. IS THAT YOU'RE A MAN OF SUBSTANCE. PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAGEDIES IN YOUR LIFE. AND WE ARE INSPIRED BY THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE RESPONDED TO THOSE. AND FOR MYSELF, AND I THINK I SUSPECT FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER MY CONDOLENCES FOR THE LOSS OF YOUR SON BEAU.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I KNOW THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN. AND I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TELL US A STORY ABOUT HIM, THE PRESIDENT IN HIS EULOGY CALLED YOUR SON JOE 2.0. IN WHAT WAY IS THAT A COMPLIMENT TO YOU.
YOU KNOW, MY DAD HAD AN EXPRESSION. HE USED TO SAY, YOU KNOW YOU ARE A SUCCESS AS A PARENT WHEN YOU TURN AND LOOK AT YOUR CHILD AND REALIZE THEY TURNED OUT BETTER THAN YOU. I WAS A HELL OF A SUCCESS. MY SON WAS BETTER THAN ME. AND HE'S BETTER THAN ME IN ALMOST EVERY WAY. THE THING ABOUT BEAU WAS FROM THE TIME HE-- ANOTHER EXPRESSION MY DAD HAD WAS NEVER COMPLAIN AND NEVER EXPLAIN. I NEVER ONCE SINGLE TIME, MY WORD AS A BIDEN, EVER, EVER HEARD MY CHILD COMPLAIN. WHEN HE WAS-- WHEN HE WAS IN THAT ACCIDENT, LOST HIS MOM AND HIS SISTER, HE WAS VERY BADLY INJURED. ALMOST EVERY BONE IN HIS BODY BROKEN. HE WAS IN A CAST FROM HIS ANKLES, BOTH LEGS, HIS CHEST, HIS ARMS. I USED TO CARRY HIM AROUND. AND MY OTHER SON, HUNTER BEST FRIEND A YEAR AND A DAY YOUNGER WAS JUST ABOUT THREE AN HAD A SEVERE SKULL FRACTURE. AND HE WOULD SIT IN THE ROOM IN THE HOSPITAL AND WE TURN AND HE WOULD SAY HUNT, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. FOUR YEARS OLD. NOTHING CHANGED. THE COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE HE DIED, I WAS AT HIS HOUSE AND HE SAID DAD, SIT DOWN. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. HIS WIFE, AND INCREDIBLE KIDS, HE SAID DAD, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE ME SO YOU GOT TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING. PROMISE ME YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, DAD, I'M GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. PROMISE ME. THIS IS A KID WHO-- WHO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT HIM. HE HAD THIS ENORMOUS SENSE OF EMPATHY. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. I KNOW I MAYBE SOUND LIKE A FATHER, I HOPE I-- ANYWAY, BUT IT'S REAL.
Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE YOU LOVED HIM.
OH, JEEZ, I MEAN --
HOW IS YOUR FAITH, I KNOW YOU ARE A MAN OF DEEP FAITH. HOW HAS YOUR FAITH HELPED YOU RESPOND TO HAVING LOST YOUR FIRST WIFE AND YOUR DAUGHTER, AND NOW YOUR SON. HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT IN YOUR LIFE AND IN WHAT WAYS HAS HAD HELPED WITH YOU FNS OF ALL IT IS TOO EMBARRASSING TO SPEAK ABOUT ME, THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE, MAYBE SOME PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE HAD LOSSES AS SEVERE OR WORSE THAN MINE. AND DIDN'T HAVE THE INCREDIBLE SUPPORT I HAVE. I HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE FAMILY. AND SO I FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS TALKING ABOUT-- THE LOSS IS SERIOUS AND IT'S CONSEQUENCE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THIS. BUT FOR ME, YOU KNOW, MY WIFE WHEN SHE WANTS TO-- SHE'S A PROFESSOR. AND SHE WANTS TO LEAVE ME MESSAGE. SHE LEAVES ME MESSAGE ON MY MIRROR WHEN I AM SHAVING. SHE PUT UP A QUOTE FROM KIRKAGARD. AND HE SAID FAITH SEES BEST IN THE DARK. AND FOR ME, MY RELIGION IS JUST AN ENORMOUS SENSE OF SOLACE. AND SOME OF IT RELATES TO RITUALS. SOME OF IT RELATES TO JUST COMFORT AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR WHOLE LIFE. I GO TO MASS AN I-- I AM ABLE TO BE JUST ALONE, EVEN IN A CROWD. YOU ARE ALONE. I SAY THE ROSARY. I FIND IT TO BE INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE-- COMFORTING. AND SO WHAT MY FAITH HAS DONE IS SORT OF TAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFE WITH MY PARENTS, AND MY SIBLINGS AND ALL THE COMFORTING THINGS AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED, HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE CULTURE OF MY RELIGION AND THE THEOLOGY OF MY RELIGION. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT MORE THAN THAT. BUT IT'S JUST THE PLACE YOU CAN GO. BY THE WAY, A LOT OF YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS, THE FAITH DOESN'T STICK WITH YOU. SOMETIMES IT LEAVES ME. SOMETIMES-- SO I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF LIKE-- ANYWAY --
I UNDERSTAND THE FEELING. YOU DON'T WANT TO COME OFF AS PIOUS OR HOLY JOE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M SURE NOT.
Stephen: BUT WHAT INSPIRES ME, WHAT INSPIRES ME, SIR, ABOUT YOUR RESPONSE AND YOUR LIFE AND YOUR SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND WHAT YOU INSTILLED IN YOUR CHILDREN IS THAT YOU HAVE SUFFERED. AND YET THROUGH YOUR SUFFERING, YOU SEEMED TO HAVE MADE SOME BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN YOUR LIFE. YOU'VE DEDICATED YOURSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE. AND HELPING THEM.
THINK OF ALL THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ARE GOING THROUGH HORRIBLE THINGS AN GET UP EVERY MORNING AND THEY PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. AND THEY DON'T HAVE, LIKE I SAID, ANYTHING LIKE THE SUPPORT I HAVE. I MARVEL, I MARVEL AT-- AT THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO ABSORB HURT AND JUST GET BACK UP. AND MOST OF THEM DO IT WITH AN INCREDIBLE SENSE EMPATHY TO OTHER PEOPLE. I MEAN IT'S INTERESTING. THE PEOPLE I FIND WHO I AM MOST DRAWN TO ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE-- WHO HAVE BEEN HURT AND YET I'M TO THE GOING TO EMBARRASS YOU. BUT YOU ARE ONE OF THEM, OLD BUDDY. NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU YOUR MOM, YOUR FAMILY, LOSING YOUR DAD WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND THREE BROTHERS. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT JUST-- IT'S LIKE ASKING WHAT MADE YOUR MOTHER DO IT EVERY DAY. HOW DID SHE GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH-- WITH, YOU KNOW, 11 KIDS. I MEAN --
WELL, SHE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF ME, SHE Z THAT IS IT.
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A HELL OF A JOB.
Stephen: AND I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HER. I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HER.
THAT'S THE THING.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. I LIKE TO PLAY THIS LITTLE JOKE I USED TO SAY OH, YES, I RAISED MAY MOTHER. BECAUSE AFTER DAD AND THE BOYS DIED, I, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS A LITTLE NONCOMPETU MEANTIST, EMOTIONALLY, COMPLETELY SHATTERED. I SAY I RAISED MY MOM FOR A FEW YEARS, IN WHAT A WAYS DID BEAU AND HUNTER RAISE YOU.
MY BOYS, HONEST TO GOD DID. IF YOU SAW, IF MY SON HUNTER WAS HERE, THE FIRST THING HE WOULD WALK IN AND GIVE ME A KISS AND SAY DAD, DO YOU NEED ANYTHING? ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT ME. AND LIKE YOU KNOW, EVEN MY PUBLIC LIFE. THE BOYS WOULD BE, LIKE I WOULD BE DOING A NATIONAL DEBATE WITH 70 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING THE DEBATE. AND I WOULD WALK OUT OF THE ROOM AND THE LAST TWO GUYS WOULD BE IN THE ROOM WITH ME WOULD BE PIE BOYS. LOOK AT ME, DAD, HOMEBASE. REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE, DAD, REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE. NO, I'M SERIOUS. (APPLAUSE)
IT WAS LIKE MY KIDS --
IF YOU COULD STICK AROUND FOR A MOMENT MORE, I LOO LIKE TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHO JOE BIDEN IS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK 7 DON'T GO ANYWHERE
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. I'M HERE WITH VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN.
JOE, JOE, JOE! JOE, JOE, JOE! JOE, JOE, JOE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.
Stephen: NOW AS I SAID, EVERYBODY LIKES JOE. EVERYBODY LIKES JOE. AND EVEN, I HAVE TO SAY, EVEN TALKING ABOUT YOU IN THE THIRD PERSON, I'M UNCOMFORTABLE CALLING YOU JOE, YOU'RE THE VICE PRESIDENT.
THAT'S FINE.
Stephen: NO, NO. I WANT TO GIVE YOUR OFFICE THE RESPECT IT DESERVES. HOW MUCH IS THAT? (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE MAKE JOKES ABOUT THE VICE PRESIDENT.
WELL, LOOK.
Stephen: JOKES ABOUT THE OFFICE ALL THE TIME.
THEY SHOULD, LOOK. THE VICE--  (LAUGHTER)
NO, THEY REALLY SHOULD. THERE IS NO INHERENT POWER IN THE VICE PRESIDENT SEE. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL. IT IS A DIRECTLY A REFLECTION OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT. IF YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT, THEN IT IS AN, AND EVERYONE KNOWS, IF THEY DO, IF IT'S REAL, THAT YOU HAVE HIS BACK AND YOU ALSO HAVE HIS CONFIDENCE. THEN YOU CAN REALLY DO SOMETHING WORTHWHILE.
Stephen: YOU'RE CLOSE POLTSESEE ADVISING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND BEING WITH HIM THERE FOR THE TOUGH MOMENTS. THERE IS ONE JOB THAT THAT PREPS YOU FOR. (LAUGHTER) CHIEF OF STAFF. AND I WANT TO TALK B I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IN THIS CASE IS A DONKEY.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL US RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUR PLANS.
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK YOU SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN AND I'LL BE YOUR VICE PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: SIR, YOU SAID RECENTLY, YOU SAID THIS WEEKEND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE EMOTIONALLY PREPARED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
LOOK, I DON'T THINK ANY MAN OR WOMAN SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT UNLESS, NUMBER ONE, THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHY THEY WOULD WANT TO BE PRESIDENT, AND TWO, THEY CAN LOOK FOLKS OUT THERE AND SAY I PROMISE YOU YOU HAVE MY WHOLE HEART, MY WHOLE SOUL, MY ENERGY AND MY PASSION TO DO THIS. AND I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID THAT I KNEW I WAS THERE. IT'S A-- I WENT TO A MILITARY BASE AND MET A WHOLE GROUP OF MILITARY FAMILIES, WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL, ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND ABOUT TWO-THIRDS WERE IN UNIFORM, THE OTHERS WERE FAMILY MEMBERS. AND I WAS THANKING THEM AND I REALLY MEANT IT. 1 PERCENT IS FIGHTING FOR 99% OF THE REST OF US. I WAS TALKING ABOUT THEM BEING THE BACKBONE AND SINEW OF THIS COUNTRY. AND IT WAS GOING GREAT. AND A GUY IN THE BACK YELLS, BEAU BIDEN, SERVE WITH HIM-- SERVED WITH HIM IN IRAQ. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I LOST IT. THAT'S NOT-- I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING THIS, BUT THAT-- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
Stephen: WE HAD AN EPISODE IN BAGHDAD A FEW YEARS AGO, AND THIS IS MY FIRST ENCOUNT WE ARE YOUR SON. WE REALLY WANTED TO INTERVIEW HIM WHEN WE WERE OVER THERE. YOU WERE VICE PRESIDENT. HE WAS SERVING, ACTIVE DUTY OVER THERE. AND HE DIDN'T WANT ANY SPECIAL ATTENTION. HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE HIS UNIT. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE SINGLED OUT. WHY DO YOU THINK HE WAS SO MODEST ABOUT HIS OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND HE WANTED TO SERVE WITH SUCH MODESTY.
BECAUSE HE HAD SUCH GREAT COURAGE AND SUCH GREAT EMPATHY. I MEAN WHEN HE GOT TO IRAQ, HE ASKED PERMISSION, HIS COMMANDING GENERAL SAID HE WOULD BIKE THE NAME BIDEN OFF HIS IDENTIFICATION. I THINK HE HAD ROBERTS ON IT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY, ANYBODY, ANYBODY GIVING HIM ANYTHING SPECIAL. AND YOU KNOW, THAT IS WHO BEAU WAS. HE WAS JUST-- AND BY THE WAY, BEAU IS NOT UNIQUE. THERE ARE OTHER WOMEN AND MEN WHO SERVE LIKE THAT BUT YOU KNOW, HE JUST, HE NEVER, NEVER, NEVER-- HE ABHORRED PEOPLE WHO HAD A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT. AND HE WENT THE OTHER WAY. I MEAN, HE WON THE BRONZE STAR AND CAME HOME AND MADE US ALL PROMISE THAT WE WOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY THAT HE WON THE BRONZE STAR. NO, MY WORD. HE WENT TO AN AFFAIR WHERE IRAQI VETERANS WERE BEING HONORED. AND HE WOULDN'T PUT ON HIS DECORATIONS. AND HE WON THE LEGION OF MERIT, HE'S DECORATED. AND THE COMMANDING OFFICE SAID YOU MUST PUT IT ON. HE WOULD NOT WEAR IT. BECAUSE THAT WAS BEAU. IT WAS LIKE HE DIDN'T FEEL HE WAS-- MY MOM USED TO HAVE AN EXPRESSION. AND HE LIVED IT. AND I KNOW, THIS IS AN IRISH CATHOLIC FAMILY.
Stephen: NO, I LOVE HOW MANY TIMES MY MOM HAD AN EXPRESSION. MY MOM HAS SO MANY EXPRESSIONS.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE USE OF BEING IRISH IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT LIFE IS GOING TO BREAK YOUR HEART. THAT'S THE BEST ONE. SO WHAT IS YOUR MOM SAY.
MY MOM SAID, REMEMBER, NOBODY IS BETTER THAN YOU. BUT YOU'RE BETTER THAN NOBODY. EVERYBODY IS EQUAL. MY MOTHER REALLY POUNDED IT INTO OUR HEADS.
YOU KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON WHO SAID THAT. AND THAT'S THOMAS JEFFERSON. AND THIS IS WHY I THINK PEOPLE WANT YOU TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AND I KNOW THAT'S AN EMOTIONAL DECISION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I KNOW THAT IS AN EMOTIONAL DECISION YOU HAVE TO MAKE. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE EMOTIONAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T RUN. AND SIR, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOUR EXAMPLE OF SUFFERING AND SERVICE IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SOARLY MISSED IN THE RACE. NOT THAT THERE AREN'T GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES RUNNING, BUT I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE VERY HAPPY IF YOU DID RUN. AND IF YOU DON'T, I KNOW THAT YOUR SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL SALUTE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CO-FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF THE RIDE HAILING APP UBER AND HE WILL BE OUT HERE IN TEN SECONDS. PLEASE WELCOME TRAVIS KALANIK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, WELCOME. HOW DID YOU GET HERE TONIGHT.
PUSHED A BUTTON, GOT A RIDE.
Stephen: DID YOU REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE USED UBER SO FAR? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET ME TELL YOU HOW I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT UBER.
OKAY.
Stephen: OKAY. I WAS AN, I'M GOING TO DROP A FEW NAMES HERE. COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. BOOM, I HAD JUST BEEN AT A STATE DINNER WHERE I WAS THE DINING COMPANION OF MICHELLE OBAMA. AND I WAS WALKING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE DIRECT EF JAY JAY ABRAMS, I SAID JAY JAY YOU WANT TO GET A RIDE WITH ME BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO GET SOME FRENCH FRIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEED YOU A LOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
AND YOU HAD A DRIVER.
Stephen: AND I HAD A DRIVER AND HE SAID NO, I'VE GOT AN UBER. I SAID WHAT'S AN UBER. AND AN UBER PULLS UP TO THE WHITE HOUSE. AND WE GOT IN AND OFF WE WENT AND ME AND JAY JAY ABRAMS WENT DRINKING, YEAH. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO UBER KILLS PROFESSIONAL GOOD PAYING JOBS AND IT'S UNFAIR TO THE DRIVERS AND IT'S DESTROYING THE CAB INDUSTRY.
MY RESPONSE IS LET'S JUST TAKE NEW YORK, FOR EXAMPLE. TAXI DRIVERS SPEND $40,000 A YEAR RENTING A CAR. THAT SHOULD BE A BENTLEY THAT YOU'RE RIDING AROUND IN, BUT INSTEAD IT GOES TO A TAXI OWNER WHO OWNS THE LICENCE TO OWN AND OPERATE THAT CAB. IN THE UBER WORLD YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN CAR. YOU DON'T PAY $40,000 TO RENT A VEHICLE. YOU MAKE MORE DOLLARS PER HOUR AND IT IS FLEXIBLE. YOU DON'T HAVE A SHIFT. YOU CAN TURN ON YOUR WORK WHEN YOU WANT TO AND TURN IT OFF. YOU WANT TO PICK UP YOUR KIDS FROM SCHOOL, TURN IT OFF. IF YOU WANT TO GO HANG OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS, TURN IT OFF.
Stephen: EXPLAIN SURGE PRICING TO ME.
SURE.
Stephen: OKAY F I'M SOMEPLACE IN SAY AUSTRALIA AND THERE'S A THREAT OF A TERRORIST ATTACK, WHY ARE PRICES TRIPLE? IS THAT HOW WE SHOULD BE TREATING EACH OTHER?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Stephen: BUT THAT HAPPENED.
WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN DEMAND OUTSTRIPPED SUPPLY.
Stephen: YES.
THE PRICE COMES UP. IN A PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD OR ACROSS THE CITY. IF IT'S IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE SEE MANY MORE PEOPLE NEED A CAR THAN THERE ARE CARS AVAILABLE, PRICE GOES UP IN THAT AREA. THE DRIVERS ARE TOLD, THEY THEN GO TO THAT PLACE SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN GET A RIDE OUT.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
SOMETIMES SOMETHING HAPPENS IN A CITY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. AND IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY, WE BASICALLY TURN IT OFF. BECAUSE I JUST THINK COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS ARE AN EMERGENCY. MAJOR WEATHER EVENTS, THINGS LIKE THAT WE TURN IT OFF.
Stephen: DOW EVER DRIVE AN UBER.
OF COURSE.
Stephen: WHAT IS YOUR RATING.
MY RATING IS A 5.0.
Stephen: REALLY.
ALL FIVE STAR.
Stephen: DO YOU REALLY NEED THE CASH? WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?
I MEAN, FOR ME, IT'S JUST FUN, RIGHT. FOR ME --
IS IT ALWAYS FUN? WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BACKSEAT. DO YOU EVER HAVE TO SPONGE IT OUT AFTER A COUPLE GETS OUT. BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SOME STORIES.
I MEAN, LOOK, I JUST KEEP MY EYES ON THE ROAD.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE NEXT THING YOU WANT TO UBERIZE.
WE'RE DOING UBERESE.
Stephen: WHAT IS THAT.
YOU PUSH A BUTTON AND YOU GET LUNCH IN FIVE MINUTES.
DO I CALL A RESTAURANT.
NO, YOU JUST PUSH A BUTTON IN THE APP, AND THEN LUNCH IS DELIVERED.
Stephen: BUT DO I ORDER IT, WHAT DOW MEAN. AM I FORCE FED THROUGH A TUBE THAT DOESN'T SOUND THAT GOOD.
LUNCH JUST ARRIVES, HOW DO I ORDER IT THOUGH.
YOU PUSH A BERT BUTTON.
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THE BUTTON PART. IS IT A PICTURE OF A SANDWICH, A PIZZA WHAT IS IT.
WILL YOU HAVE A FEW OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM.
Stephen: AND WHERE IS THE FOOD.
THE FOOD IS IN A CAR THAT DELIVERS IT TO YOU.
Stephen: DO THEY MAKE IT IN THE CAR?
THEY MAKE-- NORMALLY WHEN YOU ORDER FOOD YOU ORDER, THEY MAKE IT, THEY PUT IT IN CARS AND THEN IT'S DELIVERED.
Stephen: YES.
IN THE UBER WORLD, THEY MAKE IT, THEY PUT IT IN CARS AND THEN YOU ORDER.
Stephen: WAIT, SO SWURN MAKES A TUNA SANDWICH. IT GOES INTO THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF A BUICK, SOMEBODY DRIVES AROUND MANHATTAN UNTIL THE SMELL IS STRONG ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE KNOW TO ORDER. THE FOOD JUST SITS IN THE BACKSEAT? I COULD GO FOR A CASSEROLE THAT HAS BEEN IN THE BACKSEAT OF A TOYOTA, REALLY, JUST SITS IN THE CAR. I GOT TO GET THIS CHICKEN BINDALOO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOWN. I THINK IT'S MORE POPULAR OVER THERE.
WE HAVE THEM IN CONTAINERS THAT ARE TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED.
Stephen: OH, GOOD, OH, GOOD. YOU KNOW ELAN MUSK.
I DO.
Stephen: YOU SAID YOU WANT 1200,000 CARS FROM TESLA WITHIN 10 YEARS OR SOMETHING, RIGHT.
NO, I MEAN LOOK, HIS CARS ARE BEAUTIFUL.
Stephen: I'VE GOT ONE, THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL CARS.
I MEAN -- IS THAT THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.
THERE ARE UBER TESLAS OUT THERE BY THE WAY.
Stephen: HIRE IS THE OTHER THING, I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT HOW GOOD THIS IS FOR DRIVERS. BUT YOU SAID YOU WANT LIKE SELF-DRIVING UBER CARS. THAT'S NOT FOR THE DRIVER. THAT'S JUST, WE'RE EMPLOYING ROBOTS AT THAT POINT. HOW IS THAT HELPING LIVERY DRIVERS OUT THERE.
GOOGLE IS DOING THE DRIVERLESS THING, TESLA IS THE DRIVERLESS THING, APPLE IS DOING THE DRIVERLESS THING, THERE IS GOING TO BE THE WORLD. THE QUESTION FOR A TECH COMPANY IS DOW WANT TO BE PART OF THE FUTURE OR DOW WANT TO RESIST THE FUTURE. AND WE FEEL THAT IN MANY WAYS WE WANT TO NOT BE LIKE THE TAXI INDUSTRY BEFORE US. AND SO THAT'S HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT.
