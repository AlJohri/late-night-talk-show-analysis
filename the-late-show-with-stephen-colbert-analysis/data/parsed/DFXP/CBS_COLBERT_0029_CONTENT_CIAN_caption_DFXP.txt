Stephen: THANK, EVERYBODY! THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"!
Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. PLEASE, THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. AT LEAST, TONIGHT I AM. THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW BEFORE WE TAKE A WEEK OFF, AND, FOR PRIVACY REASONS, I TRAVEL UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME. HERE WITH YOU, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, TELEVISION HOST. NEXT WEEK ON VACATION, I'LL BE COPERNICUS DIGBY, COBBLER DETECTIVE. "THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE, DIGBY. THIS MAN WAS BEATEN TO DEATH WITH A SHOE." "T'WASN'T A SHOE, DETECTIVE SERGEANT. T'WAS A BOOT." ( LAUGHTER ) "MY GOD, HOW YOU CAN TELL, DIGLY?" "THOSE LACERATIONS ON HIS FOREHEAD ARE CLEARLY FROM A KNURLED HEEL CAP, AND THAT CONTUSION ON HIS TRACHEA HAS TO BE FROM THE TOE BOX AND OUTSOLE WELT OF A BEADED VAMP." "CAN YOU FIND THE KILLER, DIG BEE?" "YES, SERGEANT DETECTIVE. SIMPLY ROUND UP EVERYONE IN LONDON WHO WEARS A SIZE 9 AND A HALF. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR MAN. THE GAME IS A FOOT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THE PLACE OF "DOWNTON ABBEY" NEXT YEAR. SO THAT'S NEXT WEEK FOR ME, BUT BEFORE WE TAKE OUR WEEK OFF, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR FIRST GUEST IS NONE OTHER THAN MY GOOD FRIEND, JIMMY KIMMEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE HOSTS "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE," WHICH IS A FANTASTIC SHOW THAT AIRS EVERY NIGHT AT 12:35 ON YOUR DVR. ( APPLAUSE ) DON'T MISS IT, DON'T MISS IT-- OR DO. THEN I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH ACCLAIMED DIRECTOR GUILLERMO DEL TORO-- ALONG WITH THE CAST OF HIS NEW FILM "CRIMSON PEAK." MIA WASIKOWSKA, JESSICA CHASTAIN AND TOM HIDDLESTON. I'M VERY EXCITED. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT SO MANY OF THEM AT ONCE. I'M GOING TO ASSUME IT WAS WITH A GROUPON. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE'LL HEAR MUSIC FROM INDIE-ROCK DUO BEACH HOUSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I JUST HEARD THEM. THEY'RE GREAT. I THINK THE BAND BEACH HOUSE DEFINITELY WILL BE AROUND FAIR LONG TIME, BUT WITH GLOBAL WARMING, ACTUAL BEACH HOUSES, NOT SO MUCH. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, YOU HEAR THAT? THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN GETTING ALL UP IN YOUR SOUND. SAY HEY, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, BEFORE THAT BAND DOES THAT THING, ONE MORE THING-- HILLARY CLINTON IS REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING HUD SECRETARY JULIAN CASTRO AS HER RUNNING MATE BECAUSE SOMEHOW A CASTRO IN THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS LESS SOCIALIST THAN BERNIE SANDERS.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JIMMY KIMMEL. FROM THE FILM "CRIMSON PEAK," GUILLERMO DEL TORO, JESSICA CHASTAIN, TOM HIDDLESTON, AND MIA WASIKOWSKA. PLUS A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY BEACH HOUSE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WOW! THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH! JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, YOU HAVE AN EXTRA HUMAN OVER THERE I WANT TO. WHO IS JOINING US THIS EVENING?
Stephen: THE GREAT SINGER/SONGED WRITER, VANCE JOY. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: VANCE, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: YOU UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE UKELE LATER.
YES, I AM.
Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO SHRED THAT THING?
I'M GOING TO SHRED THAT THING.
Stephen: DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG. IT'S QUITE SMALL. WE'RE ABOUT TO GET OFF FOR A WEEK, JON. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
Jon: I'M GOING TO BE IN BED.
Stephen: KEEP ME POSTED. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE TODAY, IN FACT, IF IT WASN'T FOR TV, I WOULDN'T BE ON IT RIGHT NOW. THESE DAYS I BARELY HAVE TIME TO WATCH MY STORIES. BUT THERE IS ONE SHOW I NEVER MISS, AND THAT'S "HOMELAND." I DIDN'T REALIZE THE RATINGS WERE THAT BAD. IT'S THE STORY OF A BEAUTIFUL BIPOLAR C.I.A. AGENT, CRIME FIGHTING AND HAVING SEX, FREQUENTLY AT THE SAME TIME. IT IS PACKED WITH ACTION, CONTROVERSIAL DRONE STRIKES, AL QAEDA PLOTS, CHAOS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IT'S A GREAT ESCAPE FROM WATCHING THE NEWS EVERY DAY. SEASON 5 JUST KICKED OFF, AND I'M LOVING IT. THERE IS SO MANY PRESSING QUESTIONS I CAN'T WAIT TO HAVE ANSWERED CAN CARRIE RETURN TO NORMAL LIFE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR? WILL SAUL RESTORE THE C.I.A.'S REPUTATION? WILL WE EVER SEE THE HOT WIFE FROM SEASON ONE AGAIN? WELL, LAST SUNDAY'S EPISODE HAD A SHOCKING TWIST THAT NO ONE WHO CAN'T READ ARABIC SAW COMING.
THREE GRAFFITI ARTISTS HIRED TO ADD A TOUCH OF AUTHENTICITY TO A SET FOR THE SHOW "HOMELAND," THEY USED THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A STATEMENT.
CARRIE MATHISON, PLAYED BY CLAIRE DANES, CAN BE SEEN STRIDING PAST AN ARABIC WALL READING "'HOMELAND' IS RACIST."
Stephen: THAT IS A MAJOR INTELLIGENCE FAILURE. ( LAUGHTER ) LOOKS LIKE THE NEXT EPISODE MIGHT EXPLORE THE ETHICS OF ENHANCED SCREAMING AT AN INTERN. IT TURNS OUT SOMEBODY ON "HOMELAND" HIRED GRAFFITI ARTISTS, WHO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTEST WHAT THEY SAW ON THE SHOW AS UNFAIR DEPICTION OF MUSLIMS. WOW, WHO COULD'VE PREDICTED A GRAFFITI ARTIST WOULD BREAK THE RULES? ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS THE MOST SHOCKING BACKGROUND PROTEST ON PREMIUM CABLE SINCE THE TIME THOSE EXTRAS IN "GAME OF THRONES" PARADED AROUND FULLY CLOTHED. I COULDN'T FOLLOW THE STORY. AND NOW, THE GRAFFITTI ARTISTS ARE BRAGGING THAT THEY HAD ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES IN "HOMELAND." FOR EXAMPLE, THIS ONE THAT TRANSLATES AS "HOMELAND IS A JOKE, AND IT DIDN'T MAKE US LAUGH." AND "HOMELAND IS A WATERMELON," IN A STATEMENT ON THE WEB SITE THEY CLAIM THEY'RE FIGHTING INACCURATE DIPICKSES OF PAKISTANIS, AND AFGHANS AS WELL AS THE GROSS MISREPRESENTATION OF MUSLIM WORLD IN GENERAL. COME ON, THAT'S NOT FAIR. "HOMELAND" HAS PLENTY OF POSITIVE MUSLIM LIKE THE COLLEGE PROFESSOR-- NO HE WAS AL QAEDA. THE PLUCKY REPORTER WHO WAS ALSO AL QAEDA. HOW ABOUT THE IRANIAN INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WHO HELPED THE C.I.A. INFILTRATE HIS OWN GOVERNMENT AFTER HE STABBED HIS WIFE IN THE THROAT FOR BETRAYING HIM. WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S SHAR. SHE'S A WELL-ROUNDED POSITIVE PATRIOTIC MUSLIM CHARACTER WHO WAS KILLED BY MUSLIM EXTREMISTS. ALSO, I SHOULD HAVE SAID, FOUR SPOILER ALERTS. ( LAUGHTER ) WIND IT BACK. BUT STILL, I'M GOING TO STAND UP FOR "HOMELAND" HERE. I LOVE THE SHOW, AND, SURE, IT MIGHT NOT ACCURATELY PORTRAY MUSLIMS, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IS RACIST BECAUSE THE SHOW DOESN'T ACCURATELY PORTRAY ANYTHING. TAKE CARRIE. DO YOU REALLY THINK BIPOLAR DISORDER IS ALL ABOUT SOLVING INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACIES TO THE SOUND OF JAZZ? NO. IT'S MOSTLY FEELING SO DEPRESSED THAT YOU LAY IN BED ALL DAY BINGE-WATCHING "HOMELAND"! OKAY. AND, YES, THIS GUY IS A TRAITOR TO AMERICA, BUT NOT IN THE WAY YOU THINK.
HELLO, EVERYBODY. I'M DAMIAN LEWIS, I'M ONE OF THOSE BESKY BRITS. APOLOGY.
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT EVEN AMERICAN! YOU'RE A LIAR! I HATE YOU! ( WHISPERS ) MEET ME AT THE CABIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT MOST OF ALL, I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THE SHOW'S COMPLETELY INACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF MANDY PATINKIN. WHERE'S THE SONDHEIM? NOT ONCE IN FIVE SEASONS HAS HE SUDDENLY BROKEN INTO SONG. ♪ FINISHING A HAT. FINISH THE THE WORLDAVE HAT. ♪ LOOKING THROUGH THE WORLD OF A HAT LIKE A WINDOW FROM THIS WORLD. ♪ LOOK AT THE SKY ♪ ♪ WINDOW ♪ I'M JUST SAYING, THAT WOULD BE A LOT MORE PLAUSIBLE THAN THE MOST WANTED TERRORIST IN THE WORLD SOMEHOW SNEAKING INTO AMERICA AND SPENDING ALL OF SEASON TWO ALONE IN A WAREHOUSE TWO MILES FROM LANGLEY! AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON REMOTELY DETONATING THE VICE PRESIDENT'S PACEMAKER. THAT'S NOT A THING. AND BY THE WHAT, TWO MORE SPOILER ALERTS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, SO, GRAFFITI MEN, IF YOU'RE UPSET THAT THE SHOW IS FULL OF ARAB CHARACTERS TRYING TO DOUBLE-CROSS EVERYONE, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DOUBLE-CROSSED EVERYONE WITH THESE ARAB CHARACTERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JIMMY KIMMEL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE"! PLEASE WELCOME JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLEASE WELCOME JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. CONGRATULATIONS BY THE WAY. THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL-- IT'S LIKE A-- IT'S LIKE BEING IN EYE CHURCH, EXCEPT FOR INSTEAD OF JESUS, THERE'S YOU.
Stephen: YOU ARE FORGIVEN. YOU ARE  FORGIVEN.
I SAW YOU-- I WATCHED YOU WITH OPRAH LAST NIGHT.
Stephen: I GOT A CONTACT TIE FROM HER. YOU HAVE SPENT TIME WITH HER?
YES. I SPENT TIME WITH HER. SHE'S BEEN TO MY HOME.
Stephen: SHE HAS? SHE'S BEEN TO MY HOME, TOO.
IT WAS AN INTERESTING TALK. WHAT WAS THAT BOOK YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT.
Stephen: UM... THE BIBLE.
YEAH. I GOTTA GET THAT.
Stephen: IT WAS REALLY GOOD, YEAH.
REALLY SOUND --
THERE WERE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BOOKS TOGETHER-- REALLY?
Stephen: YEAH.
CAN YOU GET THAT ON AMAZON.
Stephen: YES, YOU CAN ACTUALLY. SPOILER ALERT-- HE'S OKAY IN THE END.
OH, OKAY. PHEW.
Stephen: GET DARKZ THERE FOR A WHILE. GETS DARK THERE FOR A WHILE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY I I THINK BRODIE MIGHT BE COMING BACK. I'M DOING GOOD. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M DOING WELL, THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU'RE BACK IN TOWN TO DO A WEEK OF SHOWS IN BROOKLYN AT THE BROOKLYN ACADEMY--
THAT'S RIGHT. NEXT WEEK WE ARE AT THE BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC. WE HEARD-- WHILE YOU ARE TAKING VACATION --
I'M TAKING A WEEK OFF NEXT WEEK. I'M GOING TO FIGHT CRIME AS A COBBLER.
FIVE WEEKS IN A ROW.
Stephen: SIX WEEKS.
SIX WEEKS IN A ROW. IT'S TIME FOR A WEEK'S VACATION, MY FRIEND.
Stephen: HOW MANY DO YOU DO? HOW MANY DO YOU DO?
YOU WORKED SIX WEEKS --
DO YOU WORK MORE THAN SIX WEEKS IN A ROW?
OF COURSE, I-- EVERYONE WORKS MORE THAN SIX WEEKS IN A ROW!
Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU DO A LATE-NIGHT SHOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WAS THIS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID TO LES MOONVES, I'D LOVE TO DO THE THE SHOW AND I HAVE A WEEK'S CRUISE BOOKED AND I NEED TO BE AWAY THEN.
Stephen: YOU SHOULD GET A BETTER AGENT.
WE HAVE THE SAME AGENT.
Stephen: YOU AND I I HAVE THE SAME AGENT.
HIS NAME IS JAMES DIXON. HE CALL HIM BABY DOLL DIXON. PEOPLE HAVE SHOARNTED IT TO BABY NOW. PEOPLE THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR DAUGHTERS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR AGENT S.
Stephen:  HERE'S SOMETHING PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
I DO A LITTLE BIT OF ART WORK.
Stephen: YOU GAVE THIS TO ME CHRISTMAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THIS IS A PORTRAIT YOU DID OF OUR AGENT. THIS IS JAMES BABY DOLL DIXON. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE EYE DON'T THINK YOU WOULD HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY HIS NAME. PEOPLE WOULD GO, "IS THAT GUY'S NAME BABY DOLL."
THIS IS A SCREEN PRINT. I DREW THE SMOKE. EACH HAS ITS OWN SMOKE CURL.
Stephen: SO THIS IS UNIQUE?
YES.
Stephen: HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I COULD GET FROM THIS? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SHOWING UP ON E-BAY?
NO. I THINK YOU COULD GET $100 YOU.
Stephen:  HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH BABY DOLL.
I DO, IT'S TOO CLOSE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. JAMES BABY DOLL DIXON. HE'S A VERY WEALTHY MAN, AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT THE MINUTE YOU MEET HIM.
Stephen: HERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE. THAT'S HIM. THAT'S THE GUY.
Stephen: THIS IS BABY DOLL LIKE IN MID-FEBRUARY. THIS IS AS LOW AS THE TAN EVER GOES. ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU SEE, THERE'S --
IS IT?
THERE'S A RACE BETWEEN HIS SKIN AND HIS LUNGS TO SEE WHO WILL GET CANCER FIRST. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT'S LIKE-- IT IS LIKE-- IT'S LIKE WHEN HE SHOWS UP IT'S LIKE WHO PUT A FAMILY BIBLE IN A SHIRT?
WELL, HE-- I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM, BECAUSE HE STAYS AT MY HOUSE-- DOES HE EVER STAY AT YOUR HOUSE?
Stephen: I HAVE NEVER TOLD HIM WHERE I LIVE.
I FEEL LIKE HE BEHAVES DIFFERENTLY-- HE LIVES IN NEW YORK-- WHEN HE COMES TO VISIT IN L.A.
Stephen: THERE'S DEFINITELY EAST COAST BABY DOLL, WEST COAST BABY DOLL.
LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS. EAST COAST BABY DOLL, DOES HE WEAR A LOT OF COLOGNE.
Stephen: I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WITH HIM SOMEPLACE, AND HE HAS SAID, BUT WE HAVE TO STOP. I NEED TO GET SOME COLOGNE." WE GO INTO A CVS AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE. DON'T GIVE ME THE PAWK OI RABAN.
HE WEARS ONE KIND OF COLOGNE, VERSACE, IT'S EXPENSIVE AND HE GOES THROUGH-- MY HAND TO STEPHEN UP THERE-- ONE BOTTLE OF COLOGNE A WEEK.
Stephen: HE SMELLS FANTASTIC THOUGH.
HE, DOES, HE SMELLS GREAT. SO DOES MY WHOLE HOUSE NOW THANKS TO HIM. DOES HE CALL YOUR ASSISTANT AND ASK FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S SHOW SOTHAT HE CAN THEN CALL YOU AND TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT WAS THE NEXT DAY?
Stephen: WELL, GOD, GOD, I HOPE NOT! BECAUSE IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU HAVE JUST BLOWN AN ILLUSION THAT I HAVE. I THOUGHT HE ACTUALLY WATCHES WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.
MAYBE OCCASIONALLY, BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT EVEN WATCHING THIS. HE'S GOT TWO CLIENTS ON AT ONCE AND HE'S OUTSIDE SMOKING. DOES HE BRAG ABOUT HOW MANY HOUSES HIGH OWNS AND COUNTRY CLUBS HE BELONGS TO IN YOUR PRESENCE?
Stephen: HE'S VERY PROUD OF THAT.
HAS HE EVER USED THE SENTENCE, "I'VE GOT TOO MANY CARS," WHEN IT SNOWS IN FRONT OF YOU.
Stephen: THE THING IS, HE'S-- IT'S YOU, ME, JON STEWART. WHO ELSE HAS HE GOT.
JON STEWART, CARSON DALY, ADAMICA ROLLA.
Stephen: HE'S THE REAL KING OF LATE NIGHT. IT'S BABY DOLL DIXON. IT'S THAT GUY RIGHT THERE.
THE LITTLE KING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SPEAK OF THAT, SPEAKING OF THAT KING OF LATE NIGHT THING, PEOPLE WANT US TO FIGHT AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT. ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
IT IS-- YEAH, IT'S WEIRD. IT'S A WEIRD THING. I THINK IT WAS ESTABLISHED WITH LETTERMAN AND LENO AND PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD JUST CONTINUE LIKE THE CRUSADE.
Stephen: I LIKE YOU, THOUGH.
THANK YOU. I LIKE YOU, TOO. I MIGHT EVEN LOVE YOU.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH. IF YOU DIED I'D CRY LIKE A BABY.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, GOD FORBID.
Stephen: WOW, IF I DIDN'T HAVE A SHOW, I WOULD COME TO YOUR FUNERAL.
THANK YOU, VERY SWEET.
Stephen: BUT I JUST STARTED THE SHOW. ONE THING WE DO COMPETE ABOUT IS WE'RE BOTH FOODIES.
WE DON'T COMPETE IN GENERAL. I DON'T LIKE THE WORD "FOODIE "BY THE WAY.
Stephen: I DON'T LIKE IT, EITHER.
GLUTTON IS THE WORD I LIKE TO USE. I LIKE TO COOK. I ENJOY IT.
Stephen: I FIND IT RELAXING.
ME, TOO, I LOVE IT.
Stephen: ONE THING IS ONE THING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS AND IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT AT THE END. I LIKE THE TRANSFORMATION.
IT'S BECAUSE FOR A LIVING WE DO-- LET'S BE HONEST-- NOTHING. LIKE WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THIS SHOW --
IT'S GONE.
WE'VE MADE NOTHING, WE'VE DONE NOTHING, PEOPLE LAUGH AND WENT HOME AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN.
Stephen: I CANNOT REMEMBER-- CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED ON THE SHOW A WEEK AGO?
I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT ON MY SHOW. I REALLY-- I HAVE-- I THINK I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HOSTING A SHOW RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: BY THE WAY, WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHY AREN'T YOU DOING YOUR SHOW ON FRIDAYS NIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE NO IDEA.
Stephen: DO YOU DO SHOWS ON FRIDAYS?
I DO NOT, NO.
Stephen: YOU DO NOT DO SHOWS ON FRIDAYS?
NO.
Stephen: PEOPLE WORK ON FRIDAYS, JIMMY! EVERYONE WORKS ON FRIDAYS!
IN LOS ANGELES, NOBODY WORKS ON FRIDAYS S.
Stephen:  BEFORE THIS, WE'LL CUT TO THE CHASE HERE, IS THAT I CHALLENGED YOU TO COOK OFF AGAINST ME.
YES.
Stephen: CAN WE DO THAT.
A LITTLE COOK-OFF.
Stephen: YOU MADE A PASTA SAUCE. I MADE A PASTA SAUCE. AND WE HAVE SOME PHOTOS HERE. THIS IS YOU PROVING YOU WERE COOKING.
WE HAD TO PROVE BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BELIEVE WE REALLY MADE THE PASTA. THERE IS ME WITH MY MEAT BALL.
Stephen: THERE IS ME WITH MY FIRST INGREDIENT, GETTING DRUNK.
HERE'S ME WITH WITH-- THESE ARE THE TOMATOES I USE. I LOVE THEM.
Stephen: THIS IS SOME OF MY VEGETABLES I'M GOING WITH. WHEN WE COME BACK, WHEN WE COME BACK, WE WILL SERVE THE PASTA AND WE'LL FIND OUT WHO WINS?
WE HAVE A SPECIAL MYSTERY JUDGE.
Stephen: MYSTERY JUDGE, YES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE JIMMY KIMMEL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WE'RE HERE WITH JIMMY KIMMEL. JIMMY KIMMEL. AND BEFORE THE BREAK I CHALLENGED JIMMY TO A PASTA SAUCE CONTEST.
I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY WORKING ON THIS.
Stephen: AS DID I. AND PLEASE, WE'RE ABOUT TO PRESENT OUR PASTA SAUCES RIGHT NOW. PLEASE WELCOME OUR CELEBRITY JUDGE, JAMES BABY DOLL DIXON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THERE YOU GO.
BABY! BABY, SIT RIGHT DOWN THERE.
OH, MY GOODNESS!
Stephen: SIT DOWN.
CAN I UNBUTTON MY JACKET.
Stephen: I HAVE TO SAY YOU SMELL FANTASTIC.
HOW DO I SMEM?
VERY COLOGNEY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION HERE. IT CAN'T BE A TIE. I KNOW WE'RE BOTH YOUR CLIENTS. I KNOW STEPHEN MAKES A LOT MORE MONEY I DO BUT I DON'T WANT THAT TO PLAY INTO THIS. JUDGE IT ON THE FOOD ALONE.
Stephen: OR WHICH ONE YOU LOVE MORE. OKAY, NOW--
MAY I? MAY I?
Stephen: NAPKIN IN YOUR LAP. YOU'RE NOT AN ANIMAL. LET'S START. I'LL GET STARTED HERE. TODAY I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU A--
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THAT LOOKS FANTASTIC.
THAT DOES LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
Stephen: THIS IS BEEF AND PAN CHETA.
StephCHETA.
DID YOU MAKE THE PASTA YOURSELF. DID YOU ROLL IT ALL OUT.
Stephen: I'M PAIRING THAT WITH TWO FINGERS OF JACK DANIEL'S.
AWESOME "N" AWESOME! TASTE IT. HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. COME ON. YOU LIKE IT? THERE GU.
I LOVE IT!
GIVE HIM A LITTLE DANDRUFF, TOO, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.
I LOOK TOO GOOD FOR THAT, COME ON! MAY I?
GO RIGHT AHEAD.
CAN I PUT A BIG CHUNK IN MY HOUSE.
DO IT, BABY.
NOBODY'S WATCHING.
Stephen: THIS IS FOOD PORN.
COME ON, BABY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S FANTASTIC.
IT LOOKS GOOD. I CAN TASTE IT? CAN I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF IT.
IT REALLY IS. ( LAUGHTER )
IT IS DELICIOUS.
WHEN DO I--
IT'S REALLY GOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE, THE PARSLEY. IT'S A NICE TOUCH. BABY, THIS IS SPAGHETTI AND MEAT BALLS. I KNOW YOU'RE A SIMPLE MAN PUP LIKE MEAT. YOU LIKE YOUR MEAT WELL DONE.
I DO.
I'M GOING TO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE-- DO YOU LIKE CHEESE?
I LOVE THAT.
A LITTLE BIT OF CHEESE ON THAT AND ON THE TABLE.
GO FOR THE MEAT BECAUSE FIRST?
ENJOY. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT I HAVE A COUPLE OF SIDE ITEMS, A MONEY SALAD. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOUR FAVORITE--
OH, MY GOD!
A BOWL OF CIGARETTES. THERE YOU GO. DIG IN, BABY DOLL. HE DOES LOVE TO SMOKE.
I SMOKE AFTER I EAT, GENERALLY.
HERE WE GO. THAT'S A MEAT BALL.
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU. UH-HUH, UH-HUH. ( LAUGHTER ).
I'LL TWIRL IT.
AND SOME PASTA.
UH-HUH. AND, BABY DOLL-- YES YOU MAY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I WAS HOPING IT WAS GOING TO HOLD TOGETHER MORE. THAT'S HOW I JUDGE MEAT BALLS WHEN I'M IN A RESTAURANT.
THIS IS LIKE I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN RIGHT HERE. I'VE GOT MONEY, CIGARETTES.
YOU DIED.
OH, NO!
Stephen: WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE, BABY DOLL?
DO I GET MY SHOT OF WHISKEY FIRST.
WHEN HE GOES OUT TO DINNER WITH YOU, DOES HE LEAVE THE MEAL THREE TIMES TO CALL JON STEWART.
Stephen: YES.
YES, I DO.
Stephen: AND HE GOES,"I'LL TELL YOU WHAT JON WOULD HAVE ORDERED."
IF HE EVER CAME TO DINNER WITH ME, YES. WHY ARE YOU STILL DRINKING, BABY? OH, MY GOODNESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
WELL.
Stephen: OKAY. COME ON, JAMES.
YOU KNOW, AH! THOSE WERE BOTH SPECTACULAR. WELL DONE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: UH-HUH.
YOU'RE BOTH EXCELLENT COOKS.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION, BABY DOLL.
Stephen: WHO WINS?
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE JUST WATCHING. PLEASE.
I LOVE YOU BOTH. I KNOW, BUT.
I LOVE YOU BOTH EQUALLY.  ( CHEERS ).
I'M GOING TO GO WITH-- WITH THAT PASTA.
Stephen: YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE" IS ON WEEKNIGHTS AT 11:35 P.M. ON ABC. JIMMY KIMMEL, EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE >
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUESTS ARE THE DIRECTORS AND STARS OF THE NEW FILM "CRIMSON PEAK" PLEASE WELCOME GUILLERMO DEL TORO, MIA WASIKOWSKA, TOM HIDDLESTON, AND JESSICA CHASTAIN. THANK YOU FOR BEING THE FIRST PEOPLE, THE INAUGURAL GUESTS ON THE BIG COMFY COUCH HERE.
I LOVE IT.
IT'S GOOD, YEAH.
Stephen: WE ACTUALLY HAD THIS BUILT JUST TO ACCOMMODATE ALL FOUR OF YOU AT ONCE. IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU.
AND IT'S FAT FRIENDLY.
NO!
YES, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. SOME OF THEM ARE TOO LOW AND THEN I'M WEARING A BELT, AND IT GETS VERY CHRIS FARLEY-ESQ.
Stephen: GEERM OH, ARE YOU NOT FAT. THERE IS JUST MORE OF YOU TO TERRIFY ME.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: AND YOU DO. YOU TERRIFY ME IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WAY. YOU HAVE YOUR C.V., HERE. I HAVE EVERYTHING YOU GUYS HAVE DONE. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DESCRIBE ALL THE THINGS THAT THE FOUR OF YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED. WE WON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK.
IT'S IN SPANISH.
Stephen: OH, SOLE MENTE. THAT'S MY ITALIAN. THAT'S AS CLOSE AS I CAN GET. SUFFICE TO SAY YOU'RE THREE GREAT ACTORS AND YOU'RE A GREAT DIRECTOR, AND THE NEW FILM IS CALLED "CRIMSON PEAK," WHICH IS DESCRIBED AS-- ( APPLAUSE ) PEOPLE ARE READY TO BE TERRIFIED. IT'S NOT SIMPLY TERRIFYING. GUILLERMO, YOU DESCRIBE IT AS A-- DO I HAVE THIS RIGHT-- A GOTHIC ROMANCE?
EXACTLY.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND GOTHIC HORROR?
WELL, IT IS AN OFFSHOOT OF GOTHIC. IT'S A GENRE THAT HAS BEEN ALIVE FOR TO00 YEARS OR MORE. IT WAS AT THE PEAK IN THE VICTORIAN ERA, IN THE 1800s. AND IT HAS A UNIQUE FLAVOR. THERE HASN'T BEEN A PROPER GOTHIC ROMANCE, NOT ON THIS SCALE FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS, I CAN SAY. AND THIS IS A UNIQUE FLAVOR. IT'S MORE SPOOKY. IT IS NOT SHOCKS. IT IS NOT SCARES. IT IS JUST EARY AND-- SORT OF LIKE MY DANCING, AS I DESCRIBE IT.
OH, NO!
ALSO TERRIFYING --
CREEPY?
YES.
Stephen: JESSICA, IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL. YOU'RE A VILLAIN IN THIS. I CAN SAY THAT? DOES THAT GIVE ANYTHING AWAY?
SPOILER ALERT.
YOU CAN SAY I'M CREEPY, SUPER CREEPY.
Stephen: YOU'RE USUALLY A HERO IN THINGS. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE CREEPY?
DIDN'T SOMEONE SAY PLAYING THE CREEPY PARTS ARE ALL THE FUN?
Stephen: I ALWAYS PLAY HEROES. I WOULDN'T KNOW. WAS IT FUN, REALLY?
FOR ME, IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH IT. SHOOTING IT WAS A BIT TOUGH BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY DARK AND THERE'S A LOT OF-- THE LAST 20 MINUTES OF THE FILM ARE SO INTENSE AND IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY. BUT, YEAH. IT'S LIKE FOR ME, IT'S, YOU KNOW, I HAD REBEC AMISERY, AND WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE.
SHE MURDERS MORE PEOPLE THAN A CULT LEADER.
WHAT!
SPOILER ALERT.
Stephen: THOSE THREE MOVIES YOU JUST NAMED, THEY'RE NOT DATE MOVIES THE THREE MOVIES YOU JUST NAMED.
THEY ARE IF YOU LIKE TO CUDDLE. COME OWHEN YOU WERE DATING, WHEN YOU WERE WOOING YOUR WIFE, DIDN'T YOU TAKE HER TO SOME SCARY MOVIES TO SLIP YOUR ARM AROUND HER?
THE ARM TRICK?
Stephen: NO, NO, I WAS A YOUNG ACTOR. I COULDN'T AFFORD MOVIES.
OH! A MOVIE!
Stephen: NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL. IT WAS MOSTLY JUST THE BEST RAMMAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, NOW, LET'S TALK GOTHIC ROMANCE. THE TWO OF YOU ARE THE ROMANTIC INTERESTS IN THIS FILM. IS HORROR OR GOTHIC HAVE ANY ROMANTIC QUALITY IN THE 19th CENTURY THAT WE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND TODAY. MIA, IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE WAY THEY LIVEDDED THEIR LIVES IN THE 19th CENTURY THAN THE WAY WE LIVE NOW?
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF HORROR IN EVERY ROMANCE.
Stephen: THERE IS, THERE IS, AFTER YOU BREAK UP WITH THEM AND YOU SEE THEM WITH THEIR NEW GIRLFRIEND ON FACEBOOK.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: THAT'S HORRIFYING.
I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY APPROPRIATE COMBINATION.
Stephen: THERE'S A LOT OF SEXUAL REPRESSION BACK IN THE 19th CENTURY.
YES.
YES.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK THE VICTORIANS WERE SO REPRESSED, TOM?
OOOH!
Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOOK AT YOU.
LISTEN, I WASN'T THERE.
Stephen: NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S THE ACCENT. IT MAKES YOU SEEM REPRESSED.
OH!
Stephen: NO, TO AMERICANS! NO, IT'S TRUE. TO AMERICANS, TO AMERICANS, ENGLISH PEOPLE SEEM REPRESSED.
YES, I-- I LOVE AN OLD COLONIAL DIG. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH!
Stephen: I'M SORRY, TOO SOON? TOO SOON?
IT'S OKAY. YOU RAISE AN INTERESTING POINT, THOUGH. WE LIVE IN A KIND OF-- BECAUSE VICTORIANS-- WE ALMOST LIVE IN AN ANTI-VICTORIAN AGE NOW. VICTORIANS WERE COOL WITH DEATH. DEATH WAS ALL AROUND THEM ALL THE TIME BUT YOU NEVER TALKED ABOUT SEX. YOU DIDN'T HAVE SEX, DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. SO GOTHIC ROMANCE EVOLVED AS A WAY OF TALKING ABOUT IT IN FICTION BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING-- THERE WAS ALWAYS A YOUNG HEROINE, THAT MIA PLAYS, AND A TALL, DARK STRANGER. SHE'S DRAWN TO HIM OUT OF SORT OF-- OUT OF HIS MYSTERY AND HER SEXUALITY. AND IT WAS THEIR WAY OF TALKING ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, I THINK WE LIVE IN THE ANTI-VICTORIAN. WE NEVER TALK ABOUT DEATH. WE TALK ABOUT SEX ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: WE HAVE SEX SO WE'LL FORGET ABOUT DEATH.
YES. THAT'S KIND OF THE IDEA. YEAH. THAT IS THE IDEA OF GOTHIC ROMANCE. IT'S THESE TWO OPPOSITE FORCES OF LOVE AND DEATH.
Stephen: SPEAKING OF LOVE AND DEATH LET'S TALK ABOUT PEOPLE DEALING WITH DEATH TRYING TO LOVE EACH OTHER. IT'S A CLIP FROM "CRIMSON PEAK." BEFORE WE GO TO IT, YOU SEEM VERY UPSET IN THIS CLIP. IS THERE ANYTHING WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOU IN THIS CLIP? THIS IS A CLIP WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY TO HER SHE'S GOT NOPE ELSE TO GO?
I SHOULD HAVE JUST --
YOU DON'T KNOW?
I THINK EDITH HAS JUST SEEN SOMETHING IN THE HOUSE, AN APPARITION IN THE HOUSE, AND SHE'S TELLING THE SHARPE FAMILY WE DON'T REALLY BELIEVE HER.
Stephen: JIM.
YOU HAD A BAD DREAM. YOU WERE SLEEPWALKING.
NO. I'M AFRAID I SHOULD GO MAD IF I STAY.
MY DARLING, YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS. TOMORROW YDON'T WE GO OUT TO THE POST OFFICE. I THINK SOME FRESH AIR WOULD DO YOU GOOD.
NO. I HAVE TO LEAVE. I HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM HERE.
EDITH, THIS IS YOUR HOME NOW. YOU HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
OOOOH! ( APPLAUSE )
POOR MIA. POOR MIA.
Stephen: A VERY HAPPY RELATIONSHIP. VERY HAPPY RELATIONSHIP. HALLOWEEN IS COMING UP HERE-- SPEAKING OF SPOOKY. OBVIOUSLY, JESSICA, YOU'RE FROM THE UNITED STATES, AM I RIGHT? I MIGHT HAVE SAID CANADA. YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME. >>. IS HALLOWEEN A BIG DEAL IN STRAL?
WE DON'T DO IT AS WELL, I THINK. WE TRY BUT IT'S NEVER TAKEN OFF IN THE SAME WAY IT IS HERE.
Stephen: BECAUSE LIFE ITSELF IS SO TERRIFYING IN AUSTRALIA.
IT'S SORT OF AN EVERYDAY THING ANYWAY.
Stephen: WHAT ABOUT DAY OF THE DEAD? IS THAT LIKE HALLOWEEN?
VERY DIFFERENT.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? YOU HAVE SKELETONS AND STUFF, RIGHT?
WE ACTUALLY GO TO CEMETERIES AND VISIT OUR DEAD RELATIVES, AND TALK TO THEM.
Stephen: AND IT'S A HAPPY THING?
WELL, YOU BRING EXPWOOZ FOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AT THE END OF THE TEQUILA BOTTLE, YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO, NO MATTER IF IT'S AN EMPTY GRAVE OR NOT.
Stephen: YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE WORM.
WITH WHATEVER IS THERE.
Stephen: TOM WHAT, ABOUT IN ENGLAND? WAS HALLOWEEN A BIG THING FOR YOU?
IT'S NOT SO MUCH A DRESSING UP THING. OCCASIONALLY I WOULD GO TO THE PARTY SHOP AND GET, LIKE, VAMPIRE TEETH OR A WITCH'S HAT.
Stephen: I BET YOU WOULD MAKE A GREAT VAMPIRE.

LISTEN, LISTEN, IT'S A GOTHIC ROMANCE, AS WE'VE ESTABLISHED.

Stephen: THAT'S THE ROMANTIC PART. YOUR BARE ASS IS THE ROMANCE.
IT'S ABOUT LOVE AND DEATH, SEX AND VIOLENCE, AND, YOU KNOW, FAR BE IT-- I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE ELSE HAS SEX, BUT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU KEEP YOUR PANTS ON, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. IT'S KIND OF THE WAY --
