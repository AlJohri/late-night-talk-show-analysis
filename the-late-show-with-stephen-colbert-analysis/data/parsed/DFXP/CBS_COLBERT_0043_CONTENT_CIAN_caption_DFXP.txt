THEN WE'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE BY THE BANDED" INTERNET" NOW I HAVEN'T SHERD-- I HAVEN'T HEARD THE SONG YET BUT I ASSUME IT'S 90% PORN. (LAUGHTER) THAT SOUND YOU JUST HEARD RIGHT THERE, THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. GIVE IT UP, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY ARE ABOUT TO BASTE YOUR BRAINS IN A FUNK SAUCE, BUT BEFORE THEY DO FOLLOWING ALLEGATIONS OF DOPING IN RUSSIAN ATHLETICS VLADIMIR PUTIN CALLED FOR AN INQUIRY AND THEN RAN A TWO MINUTE MILE.

Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU STAY HUMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HEY! THANKS SO MUCH. HEY, HOW ARE YOU FOLKS DOING TONIGHT? YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT I ENJOY? I ENJOY HAVING A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT. YOU GUYS LIKE THAT? WE GET TO HAVE SOME SAY ON WHO GOVERNS US. AND GUESS WHAT, THERE ARE JUST 361 MORE SHOPPING DAYS UNTIL WE GET TO PICK A NEW PRESIDENT. AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE THICK OF DEBATE SEASON. FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING AT US FAST AND FIORINAOUS. BUT OF ALL THE DEBATES, THE MOST NEXT ONE IS THIS SATURDAY THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WILL BE DUKING IT OUT RIGHT HERE ON ONLY THE CBS TV. MY ENTIRE BODY IS SURGING WITH ADRENALINE AND COMPANY LOYALTY. NOW THIS IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE BECAUSE THE G.O.P. FIELD IS SO BIG. HEY, GUYS, THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE, I PUT JOHN KASICH IN THERE THREE TIMES. (LAUGHTER) SAME DAMN PICTURE. MEANWHILE THEM DEMS ARE DOWN TO JUST THREE CANDIDATES. HILLARY, BERNIE AND-- DON'T TELL ME-- AND I KNOW, NO ONE IS GOING TO TRY. A DOUBLE M NAME IT IS MURKIN MUFLY-- IT'S MISS TER MISS TER, MITT MOMNEY, NO, MALLOW MARS-- NO, WHATEVER. HE KNOWS HIS NAME AND THAT IS THE PORNTD THING. WITH ONLY THREE DEMOCRATS LEFT IN THE FIELD COMPARED TO THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES, THERE IS ALSO GOING TO BE SO MUCH EXTRA ROOM ON STAGE THEY SHOULD REALLY PUT THE FOURTH PODIUM ON AIR BNB. AND THIS SATURDAY WILL BE PARTICULARLY SPECIAL BECAUSE THE CBS HAS PARTNERED WITH THE TWITTER TO BRING IN LIVE REACTIONS AND QUESTIONS. AND FOLKS, THIS IS POISED TO BE THE BIGGEST TWITTER DEBATE SINCE BEN AFFLECK WAS CAST AS BATMAN. AND FOR THE RECORD THERE WILL ONLY EVER BE ONE BATMAN FOR ME, VAL KILMER. HIS SUIT HAS NIPPLES. AND THIS-- THIS IS JUST PART OF A SOCIAL MEDIA REVOLUTION IN POLITICS THAT GOES BACK TO 2008 WHEN BARACK OBAMA WON WITH A TWO-PRONGED STRATEGY. TAPPING INTO SOCIAL NETWORKS TO CREATE A SENSE OF ENGAGEMENT, AND RUNNING AGAINST A MAN WHO HAD JUST LEARNED TO DIAL NINE BEFORE SENDK A FAX. NOW SOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE THIS MAKES GETTING YOUR CANDIDATES NAME OUT THERE SO MUCH EASIER THAN THE OLD WAYS LIKE TV OR RADIO OR BUILDINGS. AND THAT'S WHY THE 2016 CANDIDATES ARE ALL OVER TWITTER. LIKE BERNIE SANDER SUPPORTERS WHO ARE SHARING PHOTOS OF THEIR BABIES FOR BERNIE, DRESSING UP THEIR LITTLE ONES LIKE THE CRUSADING VERMONT SENATOR. IT REALLY IS A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN THAN BERNIE FOR BABIES, THE TIME HAS COME TO CHANGE OF MY DIAPY. MY DIAPY IS CURRENTLY 40% POOP, 20% WEE WEE. WE NEED TO CHANGE T MY TUSHY IS RED T IS A CRISIS. I ALSO WANT MY BINKIE,ED TOP 1 PERCENT GET 90% OF THE BINKIES. SO IT ALL COMES DOWN-- (APPLAUSE).
Stephen: REALLY, REALLY? REALLY? YOU PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE. SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS SATURDAY. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN, FROM HILLARY CLINTON MOVING INEVITABLY TOWARD THE NOMINATION TO HILLARY CLINTON MOVING EVITABLEY TOWARDS TO THE NOMINATION. THE WILDCARD IS THE MAN SITTING RING SIDE DEBATE MOTD MODERATOR CBS NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR AND HOST OF "FACE THE NATION" JOHN DIKERSON. FOR MORE FROM WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM JOHN DIKERSON, PLEASE WELCOME LIVE VIA IOWA, THE JOHN DIKERSON EXPERT, JOHN DIKERSON. JOHN DICKERSON, EVERYBODY. THERE YOU GO. JOHN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, HOW IS EVERYTHING IN IOWA?
THANKS, STEVEN, IT'S GREAT. IT'S VERY WINDY HERE RIGHT NOW.
Stephen: UH-HUH. YOU MUST BE USING A LOT OF HAIR SPRAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT MOVING YOUR HAIR IN ANYWAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
YEAH, ALL THE OPEN FLAMES HAVE BEEN KEPT AWAY.
Stephen: JOHN, YOUR COHOST IS TWITTER. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE DEBATE ON SATURDAY NIGHT?
WELL, IT MEANSER'S GOING TO BE ASKING PEOPLE FOR QUESTIONS. THEY CAN SEND THEM IN AND WE'LL MAYBE ASK THOSE QUESTIONS OF THE CANDIDATES. AND WATCH WAG PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHILE THE ACTUAL DEBATE IS GOING ON.
Stephen: HOW MANY OF THE MILLIONS OF TWITTER QUESTIONS WILL BE YOU ABLE TO USE DURING THE TWO-HOUR DEBATE.
IT DEPENDS. IF THEY ARE REALLY GOOD, WE'LL USE THEM. IF THEY ARE NOT SO GOOD, WE'LL MAYBE USE THEM AFTERWARDS.
Stephen: AS KINDLING?
YEAH, TO SHARPEN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE POST DEBATE ANALYSIS.
Stephen: NOW, JON, THE-- JOHN, THE-- JOHN, THE REPUBLICANS ARE KNOWN FOR ROUGHING UP THE REFEREE IN THESE DEBATES. LIKE THE CNBC GUYS GOT SLAPPED AROUND A LITTLE BIT BY THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. DO YOU EXPECT THE DEMOCRATS TO DO THE SAME?
NO, THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT TRADITION. IN 2012 YOU REMEMBER NEUT GING RICH RAN A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS AT VARIOUS TIMES BASICALLY FOCUSED ON BEATING UP THE PRESS AND IT WORKED REALLY WELL FOR HIM. BUT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT HAS REALLY NOT BEEN SO OF THE CASE FOR THEM. SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE TRUE AFTER SATURDAY NIGHT.
Stephen: NOW BECAUSE IT'S TWITTER WILL YOU LIMIT THEIR ANSWERS TO 140 CHARACTERS OR LESS?
WELL, I WON'T BUT THE ECONOMY, STUPID, WAS A PRETTY GOOD TAG LINE FOR BILL CLINTON IN 1992 AND THAT WAS WAY LESS THAN 140 CHARACTERS.
Stephen: NOW I KNOW IT'S HILLARY CLINTON AND IT'S BERNIE SANDERS AND THE THIRD GUY IS.
MARTIN O'MALLEY.
Stephen: RIGHT, THAT'S THE NAME, MARTIN O'MALLEY. WHAT IS YOUR JOB AS MODERATOR? DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO GIVE EVERYBODY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN YOU ARE UP THERE? OR CAN YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AS SOMEONE WHO WATCHES THE NEWS, THAT HE HAS THE SAME CHANCES OF A SNOWBALL PLUNGING INTO THE DEPTHS OF HELL?
WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN CANDIDATES IN THE PAST WHO HAVE IN THE BEEN DOING VERY WELL WHEN THEY GOT ON THE STAGE. REMEMBER JOE BIDEN IN 2 THOUSAND-- 2008.
Stephen: NO, NO ONE REMEMBERS HIM IN 2 THOUSAND. JOE BIDEN DUN REMEMBER JOE BIDEN IN 2 THOUSAND.
WELL, HE, NEVER THE LESS WAS ASKING REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS AND SAYING REALLY INTERESTING THINGS AT THE DEBATE, THAT SHARPEN THE CONVERSATION AMONG THE CANDIDATES AT THE TOP. SO NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE POLLS, IF THE IDEA OF A DEBATE IS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION THAT DEMOCRATS CARE ABOUT, EVEN IF YOU ARE AT 0, YOU CAN STILL PLAY THAT ROAM.
Stephen: WILL YOU TELL US ANY OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE GOING TO ASK THE CANDIDATES?
NO.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT QUESTIONS YOU WILL NOT ASK THE CANDIDATES? ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANY OF THAT CNBC STUFF WHERE YOU ASK THEM REALLY INSULTING QUESTIONS LIKE BERNIE SANDERS, DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO FEED YOURSELF? LIKE-- CUZ CNBC GOT CRITICIZED FOR TRYING TO STIR UP ANIMOSITY BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES. ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANY OF THAT GOTCHA STUFF, JOHN?
I DONE THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY ANIMOSITY STIRRING. THERE MIGHT BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT YOUR GARDEN VARIETY QUESTIONS. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TRYING TO GET THEM TO PICK ANY FIGHTS.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO SCT QUESTIONS THAT ARE REALLY ON ANYBODY'S MIND LIKE DO THEY BELIEVE THE PYRAMIDS WERE USED TO STORE GRAIN OR WOULD THEY KILL BABY HITLER, THE REAL QUESTIONS THAT CONCERN THE IOWANS?
YEAH, WELL, AND THOSE MAY COME IN THROUGH TWITTER. SO THAT IS WHY WE WILL BE MONITERRING IT SO CLOSELY.
Stephen: WELL, GOOD LUCK, JOHN. WHO DO WE HAVE ON "FACE THE NATION" THIS WEEKEND?
WELL, WE HAVE BERNIE SANDERS THE VERY NEXT DAY. SO HE WILL BE ON TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE DID THE NIGHT BEFORE. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT TOO.
Stephen: IS HE GOING TO LEAVE OR WILL YOU BUNK IN TOGETHER THAT NIGHT?
WE MIGHT JUST GET HOT KOA KOA AND JUST STAY ON THE STAGE, TELL OLD STORIES, JUST KIND OF-- .
Stephen: LIKE A SLUM BER PARTY. PAINT EACH OTHER'S TOE NAILS WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, JOHN, I'M LOVING "FACE THE NATION," WE'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING. JOHN DICKER SORNTION EVERYBODY. WATCH THE DEBATE ON CBS THIS SATURDAY AT 9 P.M. EASTERN TIME, 8 P.M. IOWA TIME, JOHN DICKERSON EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY IHOP,
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR WHO SAYS A HOMELESS WOMAN IN THE NEW FILM SHELTER.
TRUTH IS I NEED THE MONEY FOR MY BOYFRIEND. HE'S SICK, HE'S RUN OUT OF HIS MEDS.
NO.
I'M NOT USING, I'M NOT USING, DAD.
WELL, YOU'VE SAID THAT.
A SWEAR TO GOD, IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS NOW.
YOU SAID THIS BEFORE.
I KNOW HAVE I AND I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS BUT I PROMISE YOU, THIS TIME IS T IS TRUE.
WHY DID YOU LIE ME ABOUT THE TRAIN TICKET.
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT'S NOT JUST-- HE NEEDS HIS MEDS. HE'S SO SICK. AND I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME. THEY COST $370. I.
WELL, IF HE'S THAT ILL, THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM TO A HOSPITAL.
WE'VE BEEN. LOOK, DAD, I KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. I KNOW THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU NO REASON TO.
YOU ARE LYING, SWEETHEART.
PLEASE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER CONNELLY. (APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: I'M A BIG FAN, A LONG-TIME FAN, SINTS '80S OF YOUR WORK, SWI HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I COULD BE A FAN OF YOU SINCE THE 198 0S. DOES THAT EVER FREAK YOU OUT THAT YOU HAVE FANS FROM THE 19 '80S. BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE YOU WERE A KID.
I HAVE BEEN DOING IT THAT LONG, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY FANS THOUGH.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A LOT OF FANS HERE (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Stephen: ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR, STARRED IN SO MANY GREAT FILMS, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, LABYRINTH, REQUESTION EM FOR A DREAM AND A BEAUTIFUL MIND. YOUR NEW FILM IS CALLED SHELTER WHICH OPENS IN THEATERS TOMORROW WHERE YOU PLAY A HOMELESS WOMAN. IS THIS THE MOST CHALLENGING ROLE YOU'VE EVER PLAY SMD BECAUSE YOU REALLY THREW YOURSELF BODY AND SOUL INTO, THIS I THINK.
IT WAS REALLY-- IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING. IT FELT LIKE IT WAS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY. I THOUGHT IT WAS A BEAUTIFULFULLY WRITTEN CHARACTER. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER LIFE ARE CERTAINLY INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT FROMMED CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY LIFE, GRATEFULLY. AND SO I HAD A LOT TO WORK WITH. BUT IT WAS FUN AND FULFILLING, YOU KNOW. IT WAS-- IT REMINDED YOU WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS AS AN ACTOR, WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF FREEDOM AN GIF ENTHAT MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT MUCH SPACE ANGRY RESPECT FROM A DIRECTOR.
Stephen: THERE IS A PARTICULAR FREEDOM IN THIS MOVIE, I THINK, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. YOU TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE AN ACTRESS. YOU HAVE BEEN PERFORMING SINCE YOU WERE 11.
I DID MY FIRST MOVIE WHEN I WAS 11.
Stephen: 11 YEARS OLD, THAT WAS ONCE UPON TIME IN AMERICA.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: AN AMAZING FILM TO START WITH.
THE FILM WAS AMAZING, I HAD NO CLUE WHAT I WAS DOING, NOR DO I REALLY NOW BUT-- I WAS KIND OF ALONG FOR THE RIDE BUT IT WAS AN AMAZES RIDE.
Stephen: BUT FOR, A YOUNG GIRL AND FOR A WOMAN IN HOLLYWOOD, THERE ARE CERTAIN STANDARDS OF BEAUTY YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN YOUR ENTIRE CAREER. AND AT LEAST FROM THE OUTSIDE. AND OBVIOUSLY IT DOESN'T SEEM HARD FOR YOU. YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. BUT THIS ROLE, THAT WASN'T THE GOAL TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL IN THIS.
YES, THAT IS NOT WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.
Stephen: NO, YOU WERE NOT. AND AWE CHIEFED IT.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU ACHIEVED NOT BEAUTIFUL WHICH ISN'T EASY FOR A BEAUTIFUL PERSON TO DO. BECAUSE I THOUGHT, DID YOU SEE-- OUT OF TIME RICHARD GERE-- A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE AS A HOMELESS MAN BUT THE ENTIRE TIME I KIND OF THOUGHT THAT'S SHABBY CHIC. HE MADE IT LOOK GOOD, AS RICHARD GERE.
YOU ARE SAYING I DID NOT LOOK SHABBY, JUST SHABBY.
Stephen: IS THIS A RELIEF AT ALL, TO GO I CAN ABSOLUTELY LET MYSELF GO, THROW MYSELF IN AND NOT CARE WHAT ANGLE THE CAMERA CAPTURES ME.
I LIKE NOT THINKING-- THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME, THAT IS KIND OF LIBERATION, FEELING LEAK I'M NOT SELF-CONSCIENCE OF MY, YOU KNOW, THAT'S-- IT'S NICE FEELING THAT AND JUST FOCUSING ON BEING IN THE SCENE. I LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT SO I LOOKED VERY UNHEALTHY IN THE MOVIE.
Stephen: THAT SUCKS BECAUSE IF YOU GET TO BE IN A MOVIE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK, WHY NOT LIKE SOMEONE ADDICTED TO BROWNIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LIKE DENIRA IN-- WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH ITALY EATING PASTA SAUCES, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THAT'S TOO BAD. DID YOU PAN HANDLE AT ALL, IN CHARACTER. DID YOU HAVE TO GO OUT THERE.
WE HAVE SCENES, ONE SEQUENCE IN THE GING OF THE FILM WHERE I AM INASSOR PLACE.
Stephen: HERE IN NEW YORK.
WE GOT THERE VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. AND I KIND OF SET UP MY THING AND THE CREW WAS ACROSS THE STREET WITH A LONG LENS AND THEY JUST SORT OF-- PEOPLE, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ALLOWED TO SAY THIS OR DO THAT, ACTUALLY.
SURE, SURE.
Stephen.
LET'S SAY YOU CAN.
Stephen: SO YOU WERE OUT THERE WITH A SIGN.
I WAS OUT THERE WITH A SIGN AND PEOPLE WERE COMING UP.
Stephen: DID THEY RECOGNIZE YOU, AS JENNIFER CONNELLY AT ALL?
SOME PEOPLE, AFTER A WHILE. BUT NOT, NOT FOR A LONG TIME.
Stephen: DID THEY COME UP AND SAY I LOVED NEW BEAUTIFUL MINE, HERE'S $5? TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
I DIDN'T-- MACKIE WAS IN THE MOVIE WITH ME, HE RELATED A STORY SOMETHING LIKE, THAT SOMEONE THAT HE KNEW RECOGNIZED HIM AND SAID OH, ANTHONY, SORRY, SORRY. BUT I DIDN'T-- I DID HAVE A WOMAN, I FELT REALLY CONFLICTED ABOUT IT. HI A SIGN AND IT SAYS I USED TO BE SOMEONE AND A WOMAN CAME UP TO ME EARNESTLY AND TOUCHED MY SHOIRLD AND SAID YOU STILL ARE SOMEONE. AND GAVE ME-- EXACTLY, THAT'S WHAT I FELT.
Stephen: THAT'S LOVELY.
IT'S LOVELY AND I FELT LIKE A CREEP. I DID. I FELT-- I FELT A LITTLE CREEPY. DO I TAKE THE MONEY? DO I-- .
Stephen: DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE LYING TO THE WOMAN?
YEAH.
Stephen: BUT ACTING IS ALL LYING. YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE HER 12 BUCKS THIS WEEKEND WHEN SHE GOES TO SEE IT TAKING HER 12 BUCKS THEN. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU DID A COMMERCIAL WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER. YOU ACTUALLY CUT A SONG WHEN YOU WERE I THINK PROBABLY 14 YEARS OLD.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: IN JAPAN. AND THIS IS SOMETHING, A PART OF YOUR CAREER, A PART OF YOUR CAREER THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN.
FOR A REASON.
Stephen: I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. THIS IS A DIFFERENT JENNIFER CONNELLY THAN IS WING THE OSCARS FOR THE HOMELESS PEOPLE. BUT I FELT IT TAKES A CERTAIN SKILL ALL ON ITS OWN. JIMMY, LET'S WATCH THIS COMMERCIAL. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (SPEAKING JEES-- JAP NEES).
THIS JENNIFER.
Stephen: CUTE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DID YOU HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT YOU WERE SELLING THERE? CUZ IT WAS EITHER STEREO EQUIPMENT OR FRESH PEARS.
I LOVE THAT I'M SO INVESTED, I'M SO IN CHARACTER, EMERGED WITH THE CHARACTER. THIS IS JENNIFER. I'M NOT LIKE A FICTIONAL PERSON, IT'S ME.
Stephen: IN JAPANESE THIS IS JENNIFER ARE THIS IS JENNIFER DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS FOR?
YEAH, I THINK IT WAS-- .
Stephen: A STEREO COMPANY.
STEREO.
Stephen: YOU CUT THAT SONG.
BY THE WAY, I WILL NEVER TAKE MYSELF SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTOR EVER AGAIN, AN NOR WILL ANYONE ELSE.
Stephen: OF COURSE THEY WILL, OF COURSE THEY WILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE.
PLEASURE. THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE FILM "SHELTER" OPENS TOMORROW. JENNIFER CONNELLY, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT ART BUT I KNOW WHAT I LIKE. AND IT'S ART. AND I MEAN ALL KINDS OF ART. CLASSICAL, RENAISSANCE, ALFREDO. IN FACT, I CONSIDER MYSELF SOMETHING OF AN ART COLLECTOR. HAVE I A WHOLE PAN TREE FULL OF WARHOLS. SO OF COURSE I WAS VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR THE HUGE NEWS FROM THE ART WORLD THIS WEEK. MOD MODIGLIANI PAINTING RECLINING NUDE SOLD FOR 170 MILLION AT YISIES, THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT REMEMBER, IT COMES WITH THE FRAME. THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU. RECLINING NUDE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF MODIGLIANI'S FINEST WORKS AND IS OFTEN REFERRED TO BY ITS FRENCH TITLE "NEW COOCHIE" I'M GOING TO SAY, NOT SURE IF I CAN SAY THAT ON CBS. NOT EVEN SURE I CAN SHOW THE PAINTING BECAUSE BLOOMBERG TV COULDN'T.
CHINESE BILL YR LU YIGIAN PURCHASED MODIGLIANI NU COUCHE WHICH IS NUDE LYING DOWN FOR A RECORD-BREAKING $170 MILLION.
WE HAD TO BLUR THE MODIGLIANI.
WE DIDN'T SHOW THE WHOLE PICTURE.
IT WAS TOO RACY.
Stephen: YES, TOO RACY. THEY BLURD THE PORTRAIT WHICH IS A HUGE RELIEF BECAUSE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT I THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY SMUJED IT. OH, I'M SO SORRY, IT'S CROWDED HERE IN CHRISTIES AND I BRUSHED UP AGAINST YOUR PAINTING. HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU. OH MY GOD! WELL, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE NEWS HAS DETITILLATED ART. BECAUSE EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN A PICASSO SOLD FOR A WORLD RECORD $180 MILLION, IT WAS REPORTED ON THE NEWS LIKE THIS. NOW I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY THEY DID THAT BECAUSE HERE IT IS UNBLURRED. AND IT'S STILL HARD TO TELL WHERE THE NAUGHTY PARTS ARE. SO LET'S TRY TO COUNT HERE, LET'S SEE, TWO OVER THERE ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE-- THERE'S LIKE EIGHT AND A HALF BOOBS IN THERE. BUT SEEING JOURNALIST COVER A FINE ART LIKE THIS BRINGS UP ALL SORTS OF INTERESTING QUESTIONS. LIKE WHAT IS ART? WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN ART AND PORNOGRAPHY. AND WHAT IF THAT LINE LOOKS LIKE A BUTT CRACK, RIGHT THERE. WHY DIDN'T THE NEWS BLUR THIS? BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT CAN I GET AWAY WITH SLOWING ON CBS? FOR EXAMPLE, EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT TO TELL SU TRUE. THE NETWORK CENSORS SAID I CANNOT SHOI THE FULL MODIGLIANI. AS YOU CAN SEE, I HAVE TO BLUR BOTH HOOTIE AND THE BLOWFISH. (LAUGHTER) YOU SEE THE-- THE WHOLE THING, SEE THE WHOLE THING, YOU HAVE TO HAVE 170 MILLION DOLLARS OR THE INTERNET. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NETWORK SAYS CAN I SHOW YOU BOTTICELLI'S BIRTH OF VENUS. LOOK AT THAT, FULLY SHUCKED ON THE HALF SHELL. THOSE FOLKS ON THE SIDE ARE THE 159 CENTURY CENSORS TRYING TO COVER HER UP. CBS EVEN SAID WE COULD AIR RAW UNCENSORED GEORGIA O'KEEFFE. WOW, THAT IS CLEARLY THE SEX ORGANS OF A FLOWER AND IF THERE IS YOUNG ORCHID IN THE ROOM WATCHING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW, PLEASE, COVER THEIR STAMEN. NOW AGAIN, THIS NEXT, THE RULES GET TRICKY WHEN IT COMES TO MICHELANGELO'S ICONIC STATUE OF THE DAVID WHICH WILL YOU NOTICE I'M NOT SHOWING YOU YET. THAT IS BECAUSE I'M ALLOWED TO DISPLAY ONLY A DISTANT PICTURE OF THE DAVID FOR, AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE, A TOTAL OF TWO SECONDS, SO BRAIS YOURSELVES FOR SOME FULL FRONTDAL CULTURE. ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, ART. ONE PENISSIPPI, TWO PENISSIPPI GONE. (APPLAUSE) YAZ CRAZY! WE ARE. I JUST HOPE TO GOD NO ONE EVER INVENTS A WAY TO PAUSE TELEVISION. (LAUGHTER) WHAT WILL IT DO TO THE CHILDREN. BY THE WAY, I KNOW THE STATUE OF THE DAVID HAS A BARE SLINGSHOT BUT YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH. LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS PRETTY COLD IN 16th CENTURY FLORENCE. ANYWAY, ALL THIS SEEMS SO ARBITRARY-- ARBITRARY, BUT MOST ARBITRARY OF ALL, I'M APPARENTLY NOT ALLOWED TO SHOW YOU THIS FOLLOWING THING, OKAY. LET'S TAKE ONE SECRETARY HERE. OKAY. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SHOW YOU THIS DRAWING I'M ABOUT TO MAKE OF TWO FEMALE BREASTS. HERE WE GO. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. THEY HAVE TO BE BLURRED, ALL RIGHT? UNLESS I REVEAL THAT THEY ARE REALLY JUST THE EYES OF A SMILING MAN. LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS. (APPLAUSE) AND WHY IS HE SO HAPPY? BECAUSE HIS EYES ARE MADE OF BREASTS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) SO UNTIL ALL THIS CONTROVERSY OVER WHAT IS TOO RACY TO BE CONSIDERED ART IS SETTLED, I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST STAY SAFE AND STICK WITH WHAT IS ALLOWED ON NETWORK TV. POLICE PROCEDURALS WHERE THEY STACK UP DEAD HOOKERS LIKE CORD WOOD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JUD APP A TAW.-- JUDD APATOW.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS AN EMMY-WINNING WRITER, DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER AND NOW STANDUP COME ED YEN, PLEASE WELCOME JUDD APATOW. (APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DRAWING.
Stephen: YOU HAVE A DRAWING?
CAN WE SHOW THIS ON TV, JUDD?
WHICH CAMERA, WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WITH ME.
Stephen: THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, CAMERA TWO RIGHT THERE.
OKAY, HOLD ON.
Stephen: OKAY. (LAUGHTER) WOW, PRETTY BOLD, PRETTY BOLD. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME CANCELED, ANYBODY?
I'M GUEST HOSTING FOR CRAIG FERGUSON ONE NIGHT.
Stephen: REALLY?
I WANTED TO SHOW A PHOTOGRAPH OF ME IN COLLEGE PROJECT AISLE VOM-- PROJECT ILLE VOMITING AND THEY DID NOT LET ME.
Stephen: CUZ IT WAS TOO SEXY. WELL, YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY SINCE PROJECTILE VOIMENTING.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THE WRITER, DIRECTOR OF 40 YEAR OLD NEVER BEGIN WHICH YOU WROTE WITH MY FRIEND STEVE CARRELL. KNOCK KNOCK, FUNNY PEOPLE, TRAINWRECK, YOU PRODUCED SUPERBAD, BRIDES MADE, ANCHORMAN, DIRECTOR OF FREAKS AND GEEKS AND GIRLS AND YOU ARE ALSO THE AUTHOR OF SICK IN THE HEAD, CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LIFE AND COMEDY. AND NOW YOU ARE DOING A SHOW AT CARNEGIE HALL THIS SATURDAY CALLED JUDD APATOW AND FRIENDS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: OKAY, YOU DID STANDUP FOR A LONG TIME BUT YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN 20 YEARS, RIGHT?
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. IT MAY NOT BE A GOOD SHOW.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GET TO CARNEGIE HALL? DON'T DO IT FOR 20 YEARS. THAT'S A HARD LESSON.
ACTUALLY, I BOOKED THIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE I WAS VERY SURE THAT IT WOULD NOT SELL OUT. AND IT IS THIS SATURDAY AND IT SOLD OUT YESTERDAY.
Stephen: WOW.
AND I REALIZE THAT I'M NOT REALLY A DRAW. I REALIZE WHAT MY LEVEL OF FAME IS.
Stephen: OF COURSE YOU ARE.
THIS IS MY LEVEL OF FAME. IF I'M WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND SOMEBODY SAYS ARE YOU JUDD APATOW, IF I GO KNOW THEY GO, ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I GET THAT A LOT. I GET THAT A LOT. YEAH. WELL, YOU ARE MORE THAN, YOU KNOW, A WRITER AND A PRODUCER. ARE YOU SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME WHICH IS YOU ARE A COME DE FAN FROM A YOUNG AGE.
THAT'S TRUE.
Stephen: AND SO WAS I. HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU SAID TO YOUR EF I WANT TO DO THAT.
I THINK I WAS TEN. I MUST HAVE BEEN A HOSTILE CHILD IN SOME WAY.
Stephen: REALLY?
COMEDIANS WERE PISSED OFF AND FLIPPING THE BIRD AT POWER. I HATED GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE AND ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE. CUZ I ALWAYS GOT PICKED LAST IN GYM CLASS.
Stephen: ME TOO.
I WAS THE NERD. EVEN NOW, HAVE I A PREJUDICE AGAINST ANYONE IN GOOD SHAPE. LIKE IF A GUY IS JOGGING LIKE A 40 YEAR OLD GUY IS JOGGING WITH HIS SHIRT OFF LOOKING GREAT I ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME REACTION. LOOK AT THAT DOUCHE BAG. I THINK THAT IS MY OPINION,.
Stephen: THAT IS WHY THEY AREN'T GOING FOR MARTIN O'MALLEY, THE GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND, BECAUSE HE'S 52 AND HE HAS A SIX PACK.
YEAH, I HATE SIX PACKS.
Stephen: YEAH.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY EXERCISE. I DON'T THINK EXERCISE WORKS. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE IF YOU-- .
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN. YOU DON'T THINK THE SCIENCE IS IN ON.
I DON'T. LIKE I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IF YOU IN YOUR LIFE RAN 10,000 MILES IN EXERCISE, THERE IS NO CHANCE YOU WILL LIVE LONGER THAN ME WHO HAS NEVER MOVED. I'M LIKE A TIRE WITH ALL OF ITS TREAD, YOU KNOW, I'M READY TO GO. I'M FULLY-- .
Stephen: YOU'RE NOT BURNG THE CANDLE AT BOTH ENDS, THAT KAND SELL STILL IN THE BOX.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS. NOW THAT YOU BRING IT UP I HAVE PHOTOS THAT YOU ACTUALLY SENT OVER. I LOVE THIS ONE. THIS ONE IS, SPEAKING OF NOT EXERCISING. YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE THE-- YOU WERE THE FACE OF A MOVEMENT. YOU SAW THIS IN WHAT MAGAZINE?
OKAY, SO SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME B YOU KNOW, DAD BODS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS LIKE GUYS WHO WORK OUT A LITTLE AND LIKE KIND OF CRAPPY. AND THEN SOMEONE SENT ME A LINK TO AN ARTICLE. I HIT THE LINK AND THE PHOTO WAS ME. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: UNBENOANS TO YOU YOU BECAME THE FACE OF A NEW MOVEMENT.
YES, CRAPPEE BODIES.
Stephen: BUT SEXY, THE IDEA OF A DAD BOD IS SHOW IT'S ATTRACTIVE TO BE OUT OF SHAPE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS FOR MY WIFE BECAUSE SHE HAS NO SENSE OF WHAT ATTRACTIVE IS OR NOT BASED ON MARRYING ME, BECAUSE-- .
Stephen: LESSIE MANN.
SHE DOESN'T GET T EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WILL GO WHY DID SHE MARRY ME. AND THEN THERE WILL BE A PARTY AND THERE WILL BE A REALLY UGLY GO AND SHE'LL GO HE'S CUTE. OH THERE, THERE, THERE IT IS. OUT OF THE BLUE SHE SAID TO ME, THIS IS TRUE. SHE SAID OH BY THE WAY MY NAME IS NOT LESLIE, IT'S LESLEY.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BE, JUST THE OTHER DAY.
JUST THE OTHER DAY.
Stephen: HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN MARRIED?
18 YEARS. HAVE I BEEN SAYING IT WRONG THE WHOLE TIME.
Stephen: WELL, WAS THERE ANY HOSTILITY IN WHAT SHE SAID.
NOT AT ALL. I SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT IN 1995? AND SHE SAID BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE MAD AT YOU.
Stephen: THAT'S A KEEPER RIGHT THERE.
EXACTLY. SHE'S VERY LOVELY.
Stephen: WHEN WERE YOU GROAG UP WHO WERE YOUR COMEDY HEROES WHO WERE THE GUYS, I WANT THAT GUY'S CAREER OR THAT MAN'S ART, OR THAT MAN'S SCOPE. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY JOKES LIKE HIM.
STEVE MARTIN WAS NUMBER ONE.
Stephen: HE WAS THE FIRST.
