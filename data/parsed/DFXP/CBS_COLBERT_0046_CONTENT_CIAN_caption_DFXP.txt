WELCOME STEPHEN COLBERT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PRESENCE. THANK YOU FOR MY BOOK. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LEGISLATOR SHOW." 'RE. I'M YOUR HOST, A MINIATURE STEPHEN COLBERT WHO LIVES INSIDE YOUR TV. WHEN THE TV GOES OFF, I CAN STILL SEE YOU, JUST LIKE YOUR X-BOX. NO JUDGEMENT, EXCEPT FOR THA WOULONE THING YOU DO, GROW UP. THANK YOU FOR WHAT I'M GOING TO TRUST WAS YOUR SINCERE APPLAUSE JUST A MOMENT AGO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. I LOVE IT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S NOT THE MINDLESS CHEERING OF A HORDE OF ROBOTS, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO TELL WHO ARE THE PEOPLE AND WHO ARE THE ROBOTS. THAT'S HOW FAST THE ROBOTS ARE PROGRESSING. AND I FEAR THE EVENTUAL ENSLAVEMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE BY THE METAL MEN. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING: OH, THEY'LL NEVER DO THAT. TEDDY RUXPIN WAS MY FRIEND. NO, HE WASN'T. AND NEITHER WAS TICKLE ME ELMO. THAT WAS JUST PUTTING A MUPPET FACE ON OUR CYBERNETIC OVERLORDS. THINK ABOUT THE NAME. TICKLE ME ELMO? s WHY WASN'T IT TICKLE YOU ELMO? WHO IS IN CONTROL HERE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A ONE-SIDED RELATIONSHIP. JUST GET OUT OF THERE. IT'S GETTING WORSE. THERE'S SHOCKING NEWS OUT OF JAPAN, ROBOT DESIGNERS HAVE NOW CREATED AN ARTIFICIAL ROBOT THAT PASSED THE STANDARDIZED EXAMS, LIKE THE S.A.T.s. THIS THING IS GOING TO CHALLENGE. THE ONLY SILVER LINING IS THEY MIGHT AVOID A ROBOT UPRISING. IN MEDIEVAL FRENCH LITERATURE, THE ROBOTS WON'T BE ABLE TO ENSLAVE US BECAUSE THEY'LL BE TOO BUSY PAYING OFF THEIR STUDENT LOANS. "WHAT WAS I THINKING? I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO LAW SCHOOL. CAN I GET YOU A REFILL ON THAT PEPSI?" ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF THERE ARE ANY ROBOTS WATCHING, I HOPE THEY ENJOY TONIGHT'S SHOW. BECAUSE, FIRST-- WE HAVE A VERY GOOD SHOW TONIGHT-- FIRST, I'M TALKING TO ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR JULIANNE MOORE. SO TALENTED.
Jon: A GENIUS. FANTASTIC.
Stephen: I'LL JOIN IN. I'LL JOIN IN ON THAT ONE. LONGTIME FAN. LONGTIME FAN. SHE STARS IN "THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY -- PART 2." OUR INTERVIEW WILL BE GRIPPING, ESPECIALLY THE SECOND HALF THAT COMES OUT A YEAR FROM NOW. I'M ALSO SITTING DOWN WITH LEGENDARY ACTOR MR. BURT REYNOLDS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. A MODEL OF MANHOOD. BURT'S NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME." HE WAS A HUGE SEX SYMBOL IN THE 70s. NOW HE'S A HUGE SEX SYMBOL IN HIS 70s. THEN A PERFORMANCE BY POST-PUNK POWERHOUSE PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY USED TO BE PUBLIC IMAGE INCORPORATED, BUT THEY BECAME AN S-CORP FOR TAX LIABILITY REASONS. WHICH IS VERY ROCK 'N' ROLL. ♪ ♪ ♪ THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON, NOW, IF I'M NOT WRONG, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST SITTING WITH THE BAND THIS EVENING. WHO IS THAT?
Stephen: WE HAVE THE SOULFUL VOKALS OF CEELO GREEN.
Stephen: CEELO GREEN, EVERYBODY. CEELO, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: AND THANK YOU ESPECIALLY-- CEELO GREEN. ♪ ♪ ♪ I WANT TO THANK YOU ESPECIALLY FOR WEARING YOUR FORMAL TRACK SUIT TO BE HERE TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR GOING THE EXTRA YARD. WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN THE BAND, MY FRIEND? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALWAYS A PLEASURE. THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET THIS PARTY STARTED, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: A MAN IN NEW YORK CITY CLAIMS THAT TWO PSYCHICS TRICKED HIM OUT OF $700,000. AND THEY WERE CLEARLY FRAUDS BECAUSE THEY PREDICTED THEY'D TAKE HIM FOR A MILLION.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES, JULIANNE MOORE. BURT REYNOLDS. AND A PERFORMANCE BY PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING "LATE SHOW" THEME  )
Stephen: THANK YOU! THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU, CEELO.
Jon: YEAH, BABY.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT FEELS GOOD. THAT FEELS GOOD. DID YOU SEE THE SHOW LAST NIGHT BY ANY CHANCE? WE HAVE-- WE HAD OUR FRIEND BILL MARH ON THE SHOW LAST NIGHT. AND WE HAD PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE INTERVIEWS WE'VE EVER HAD ON THE SHOW. AND OUT OF ALL, LIKE, 45 SHOWS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND HE'S INCREDIBLE. BUT WE DID, LIKE, 16 OR 18 MINUTES OF INTERVIEW, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AM I RIGHT? AND WE HAD TO CUT, LIKE, SIX MINUTES OUT OF IT BECAUSE WE HAD TO MAKE ROOM FAIR CAT CIRCUS. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT IF YOU LIKED THE INTERVIEW, WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE THING UNCUT, UNEDITED ON THE WEB SITE. GO TO COLBERTLATESHOW.COM AND YOU CAN WATCH THE WHOLE THING. IT'S REALLY GOOD. REALLY ENJOYABLE. YOU SHOULD GO CHECK IT OUT. THANKS FOR COMING BILL. IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW-- AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING ME RIGHT NOW, I ASSUME YOU DO-- YOU KNOW I'M A HUGE FAN OF "STAR WARS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M EVEN WILLING TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF STARS BUT ONLY ONE WAR, TECHNICALLY IT SHOULD BE CALLED "STARS' WAR." OKAY? I'M GOING TO LET IT GO. AGAIN. NOW, AS A DIE-HARD FAN, I'VE MADE A SOLEMN PLEDGE TO BUY AND USE ANY PRODUCT THAT HAS A "STAR WARS" TIE-IN. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS-- THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE-- THIS IS MY ACTUAL LUKE SKYWALKER BATHROOM SET FROM 1977. IT HAS "STAR WARS" SHAMPOO, IT HAS "STAR WARS" BUBBLE BATH, IT HAS A COMB, AND SEE IF YOU CAN SEE THIS, THAT IS LUKE HIMSELF TRAPPED INSIDE A BAR OF SOAP FORESHADOWING HAN SOLO BEING TRAPPED IN CARBONITE. AND YOU SEE IT IS HELPFULLY LABELED-- I'M GOING TO PUT IT IN THERE-- IT'S HELPFULLY LABELEED LUKE SKY WALKER BELT CLIP SO YOU CAN HANG ON THE BELT YOU WEAR WHENEVER YOU TAKE A BATH. THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE COMMERCIAL TIE-IN POSSIBILITIES OF THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE. LIKE THIS AD FOR A PRODUCT THAT SO SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATES "STAR WARS, THAT I THOUGHT AT FIRST IT WAS A NEW TRAILER.
THERE HAS BEEN AN AWAKENING. WILL YOU BE ENTICED BY THE DARK SIDE OR EMBRACE THE LIGHT SIDE? DISCOVER YOUR DESTINY WITH THE COVERGIRL "STAR WARS" COLLECTION, THREE LUMINOUS LOOKS FROM THE LIGHT AND THREE MESMERIZING LOOKS FROM THE DARK. THE FORCE IS STRONG. FEEL ITS POWER. THE COVERGIRL 'STAR WARS" COLLECTION.
WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON?
Stephen: OH, THE FORCED MARKETING INTEGRATION IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE. BRAVO, COVERGIRL. THIS IS THE PERFECT MAKEUP COLLECTION FOR GIRLS WHO LIKE "STAR WARS" BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH "STAR WARS." ( LAUGHTER ) WITH THIS NEW COLLECTION, COVERGIRL IS OFFERING THREE LIGHT-SIDE LOOKS AND THREE DARK-SIDE LOOKS. THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE ONLY IN CONTAINERS THAT DIDN'T SAY "STAR WARS." AND THE MAKEUP COMES IN SUCH INTERGALATIC SHADES AS LILAC, GOLD, DARK PURPLE, SILVER AND RED. AND FOR YOU NON-SUPERFANS OUT THERE, THOSE ARE ALL COLORS THAT EXIST IN THE "STAR WARS" UNIVERSE. NOW, AS A FAN, I'VE COLLECTED ALL OF THE "STAR WARS" COVERGIRL MAKEUP LINE. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING IN HERE. EVEN THE MUCH-MALIGNED "THE PHANTOM MASCARA" AND "JAR JAR BLUSH." OF COURSE, I'M A GROWN MAN. I WOULD NEVER WEAR THIS MAKE-UP, BUT DARTH VADER WOULD. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "AM I PRETTY NOW, DADDY?" ( LAUGHTER ) "DADDY, AM I PRETTY NOW?" ( LAUGHTER ) GETS HUMID IN THERE PRETTY FAST. ( LAUGHTER ) FOLKS, THIS COVERGIRL MAKE-UP COMMERCIAL GIVES ME A NEW HOPE, A HOPE THAT "STAR WARS" CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT. LIKE TONIGHT'S SPONSOR: EGGS, THE "STAR WARS" COLLECTION. ( LAUGHTER ) A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR, FAR WAY, THERE WERE EGGS. ( APPLAUSE ) WILL YOU JOIN THE LIGHT SIDE, OR OR WILL YOU BE SWAYED TO THE DARK SIDE ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FULFILL YOUR DESTINY AND FILL YOUR STOMACH. THE BATTLE FOR THE GALAXY IS UNDER WAY ON YOUR BREAKFAST TABLE! FEATURING ALL OF YOUR FAVORITES LIKE BB8, OR DID I MEAN B-B-EGG? YES, I DID. OH, LOOK OUT, BB, LOOK OUT. HERE COMES A STORMTROOPER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND NO BREAKFAST IS COMPLETE WITHOUT LUKE SKYWALKER. OH, YES! WILL LUKE STAY ON THE LIGHT SIDE OR WILL HE TURN ON THE DARK SIDE? THE CHOICE IS YOURS. WITH "STAR WARS" EGGS, YOU CAN EVEN REENACT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DEATH STAR. OH, YES! "LET'S BLOW THIS THING AND GO HOME!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, TRY "STAR WARS" EGGS FOR BREAKFAST AND START YOUR DAY LIKE A JEDI. "USE THE FORK, LUKE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH REIGNING OSCAR CHAMPION, JULIANNE MOORE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ♪ I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER WHEN I LOST MY MIND ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH! YEAH! THANK YOU, CEELO. IT'S FANTASTIC. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS AN ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR WHO NOW STARS AS PRESIDENT ALMA COIN IN THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF "HUNGER GAMES" SERIES, "MOCKINGJAY-  PART 2."
SHE'S MYTHIC.
COULDN'T HAVE SAMED IT BETTER MYSELF.
NO. SHE'S GOING TO STAY WHERE SHE IS. AND WHATEVER SHE'S DOING, WE CONCEIVED IT. IT WAS OUR PLAN ALL ALONG.
OF COURSE, IT WAS.
YOU'RE THE GAMEMAKER. I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW WHATEVER GAME SHE'S PLAYING, SHE'S PLAYING IS FOR US.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME JULIANNE MOORE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WOW!
Stephen: ISN'T THAT NICE? EVERYONE LOVES JULIANNE MOORE. A LOT OF FANS OUT THERE.
A NICE CROWD, VERY NICE CROWD.
Stephen: AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE NICE FANS OUT THERE? YOU'VE DONE SOME AMAZING FILM. I WANT TO RUN THROUGH THIS. PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE THEM IN THEIR HEAD ALL THE TIME. SHORT CUTS, BOOKIE NIGHTS, THE BIG LEBOWSKY, THE HOURS, THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, STILL ALICE, FOR WHICH YOU WON THE OSKTAR FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT BY AN ACTRESS NAY LEADING ROLE. AND NOW "THE HUNGER GAMES" SERIES "MOCKING JAY - PART 2", OUT THIS FRIDAY. THAT'S RIGHT. HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ON THAT.
"MOCKY JAY?" WE SHOT PARTS ONE AND TWO TOGETHER. IT WAS OVER THE COURSEAVE YEAR AND I WOULD KIND OF FLY IN AND OUT TO ATLANTA.
Stephen: ARE YOU KIND OF SAD SEEING THE SERIES ENDING?
I THINK EVERYBODY IS. IT'S A GOOD STORY AND IT'S ALWAYS EXCITING AND SAD WHEN IT COMES TO ITS CONCLUSION.
Stephen: YOU'VE DONE SO MANY THINGS-- I SAID THIS LITTLE LIST RIGHT HERE. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU, LIKE, PLAY A CHARACTER WHO KICKS ASS.
RIGHT.
Stephen: ARE WE EVER GOING TO SEE YOU, LIKE, BLAZING IN A ROOM WITH TWO PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUNS GOING EAT LEAD?
I THINK I'D RATHER DO A KARATE MOVIE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Stephen: YOU GOT THE PRONUNCIATION DOWN.
Stephen:  KARATE. YOU HAVE BEEN NOMINATED FIVE TIMES.
YUP.
Stephen: FOR AN OSCAR BEFORE YOU WON THE OSCAR. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IN 2003 YOU WERE NOMINATED TWICE INION WE'RE.
AND I LOST THEM BOTH.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE? WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?
Stephen: WHY DID I GET DRESSED UP.
I MEAN, IT FEELS-- IT ACTUALLY FEELS FINE. IT'S NICE TO BE THERE, RIGHT.
Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SPEECHES, LIKE ONE FOR BEST ACTRESS, ONE FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS? WAS ONE A LITTLE BIT LONGER?
EXACTLY. NO. I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T REALLY-- I DON'T THINK I PREPARED ANYTHING. I THINK IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT YEAR THAT I WAS NOT WINNING. THAT'S THE OTHER THING. I THINK BY THE TIME THESE DAYS, YOU GET TO THE ACADEMY AWARDS AND EVERYBODY KIND OF KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A SHOT. AND THAT YEAR I KNEW I HAD NO SHOT IN EITHER CATEGORY.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: IS IT THE FIX IS IN OR BASICALLY YOU JUST KIND KIND OF KNOW WHICH WAY THE WIND IS BLOWING.
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHERE THE WIND IS BLOWING. YOU DO.
Stephen: YOU ALSO HAVE WON AN EMMY, OR EMMYS-- MAYBE MULTIPLE. I DON'T KNOW.
TWO. ONE A DAYTIME EMY AND A RLG EMMY, NIGHT TIME EMMY, DAYTIME/NIGHT TIME.
Stephen: THEY'RE ALL GOOD. WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN REQUESTING =LY.
WE DO.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN ASKED BEFORE BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME BECAUSE IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY FAMILY. YOU'RE LIKE A GINGER ICON.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHEN YOU THINK REDHEAD YOU KNOW JULIANNE MOORE. BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED REDHEAD.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE MYTH OR THE RUMOR THAT GINGERS HAVE NO SOUL? YOU'VE HEARD THIS.
I FEEL-- I FEEL-- I HAVE COMPLICATED FEEL BUSINESS IT, ABOUT BEING A REDHEAD IN GENERAL.
Stephen: YEAH.
I THINK BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTATIONS THAT SOMEHOW YOUR HAIR HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR PERSONALITY.
Stephen: YOU'RE FEISTY.
YOU'RE FEISTY OR YOU'RE SEX. IT'S EITHER ONE --
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU RATHER BE JULIANNE MOORE?
I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: I READ A STUDY, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE WE HAVE REDHEADS IN MY FAMILY AND THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NO SOUL--
THE NO PAIN ONE. THAT REDHEADS DON'T FEEL PAIN.
Stephen: THEY CAN TAKE MORE PAIN.
I'M VERY TOUGH. I'M A VERY TOUGH REDHEAD. I CAN TAKE A LOT OF PAIN. DO IT. JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: I-- I REFUSE. I DON'T EVEN BEGIN TON WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME IF I DID THAT TO YOU. YOU'RE AN OSCAR WINNER. I THINK THE U.N. WOULD BE CALLED IN ON ME.
I WON'T-- I WON'T FLINCH.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN INTERNATIONAL STAR.
WON'T FLINCH.
Stephen: I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. THAT'S ENTRAPMENT.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO KNOW, ARE YOU?
Stephen: NO, BECAUSE I DON'T HIT WOMEN.
THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE, LIKE, A BURN.
Stephen: INDIAN BURN. DO YOU HAVE BROTHERS?
HEY, YEAH!
Stephen: WERE THEY ALLOWED TO HIT YOU?
I HIT HIM FIRST, I THINK. ( LAUGHTER ) YEAH.
Stephen: I HAVE THREE SISTERS AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HIT THIM THEM?
REALLY.
Stephen: NO, BUT WE WOULD HOLD THEIR WRISTS UNTIL THEIR HANDS TURNED PURPLE, UNTIL THEY COULDN'T FEEL ANYTHING. BECAUSE WE LOVED THEM.
YOU'RE LIKE, "STOP IT, STOP IT!" YEAH.
Stephen: OR MAKE THEM HIT THEMSELVES IN THE FACE WITH THEIR OWN HAND. IT WASN'T ME, MOM.
WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF.
Stephen: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE GINGER SITUATION HERE. YOU HAVE A SERIES OF BOOKS CALLED "FRECKLEFACE STRAWBERRY."
THAT'S MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
Stephen: THAT'S YOU, RIGHT?
THAT'S ME. THAT'S THE IDEALIZED VERSION OF MYSELF. THAT'S THE MYTHICAL VERSION.
Stephen: IT KIND OF IS LIKE YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN GO MACRO, HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET. BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY YOU AS A LITTLE GIRL. THAT IS YOU.
I WAS KINDERGARTEN.
Stephen: DID YOU NOT LIKE BEING A REDHEAD?
NOBODY LIKES THAT. NOBODY LIKES FRECKLES.
Stephen: REALLY, IT'S ADORABLE.
NO! PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE FRECKLES THINK IT'S ADORABLE. HEY'RE LIKE, "THAT'S ADORABLE!"  ND WE'RE LIKE, "NO, IT'S NOT ADORABLE."
Stephen: BUT THIS GIRLS COME TO ACCEPT IT.
BECAUSE THEY GROW UP AND IT DIDN'T GO AWAY. THERE IS A SERIES OF BOOKSES "FRECKLEFACED STRAWBERRY" BOOKS.
Stephen: I'VE READ ALL OF THEM. THEY'RE AT MY READING LEVEL.
THEY'RE A QUICK READ, THOUGH.
Stephen: BUT THEY MAKE ME SLEEPY WHICH I REALLY LOVE.
WHICH IS GREAT!
Stephen: IT'S EITHER THAT OR VALIUM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: I HAVE A QUESTION, LIKE, YOU'RE AN ACTRESS, YOU'RE VERY BUSY. I'M SURE YOU HAVE A LOT OF PROJECT GOING ON IN YOUR MIND ALL THE TIME. I REALLY LOVE THIS THING. YOU SAID YOU HAVE A QUOTE YOU LIVE BY. YOU SAID, "BE REGULAR AND ORDERLY IN YOUR LIFE SO YOU MAY BE VIOLENT AND ORIGINAL IN YOUR WORK."
RIGHT, RIGHT. YOU CAN WRITE "FRECKLEFACE STRAWBERRY" IF YOU'RE THAT VIOLENT AND ORIGINAL IN YOUR WORK.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU STAY REGULAR AND ORDERLY IN YOUR WORK.
I'M PRETTY REGULAR. I LIKE TO SAY I'M PRETTY PEDESTRIAN. I'M PRETTY BOURGEOIS. I JUST DO REGULAR STUFF.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR IDEA OF A FUN WEEKEND?
A FUN WEEKEND? LIKE, GOING FOR A WALK OR A BIKE RIDE AND GOING OUT TO DINNER OR BRUNCH AND MAYBE GOING TO THE MOVIE S.
Stephen:  JULIANNE MOORE-- TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORIES.
THAT'S IT, REALLY. THERE'S NO --
I LIKE CLEANING THE CLOSET. THIS IS MY FAVORITE THING.
I DO, TOO!
Stephen: THROWING AWAY MISMATCHED SOCKS.
DID YOU READ THE LIFE CHANGING MAGIC OF TIDING UP. THAT BOOK? IT'S THIS BOOK THAT'S ALL ABOUT CLEANING BGETTING RID OF STUFF AND OPENING UP YOUR LIFE. YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S MY IDEA OF A GOOD TIME. ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH. SEE? HE'S DOING MY KIND OF PEOPLE.
Stephen: ISN'T THIS-- BY THE WAY, IS THIS FOR SURE THE LAST ONE OF THESE MOVIES? THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE ANOTHER COLON OR COMMA.
I THINK IT'S THE END. I THINK IT'S THE END. I THINK SUZANNE COLLINS IS IN CHARGE OF THE STORY. IF SHE WRITES ANOTHER BOOK I THINK THERE WILL BE ANOTHER STORY. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL BE IN IT.
Stephen: WHAT?

I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE END.
Stephen: DON'T, BECAUSE I WILL SEE IT THIS WEEKEND?
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO GO.
Stephen: ME AND MY FAMILY AND KIDS WE READ THE BOOKS.
OH, YEAH, THE KIDS, IT'S GREAT FOR THEM.
Stephen: WHAT WITH THE BOW AND ARROW AND EVERYTHING?
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: JULIANNE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. "THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKING JAY - PART 2" IS IN THEATERS NOVEMBER 20. JULIANNE MOORE, "FRECKLEFACE STRAWBERRY." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ BE AVAILABLE TO YOU TO SEE. ♪ I'M ABOUT TO GO ♪ ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, THE 2016 ELECTION IS LESS THAN A YEAR AWAY, WHICH MEANS WE'LL KNOW WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS IN A MERE 11 SEXY FIREMEN. AND ACCORDING TO THE LATEST POLL, THE G.O.P. MAY HAVE FINALLY A CLEAR FRONT-RUNNER BECAUSE ACCORDING TO A NEW REUTERS , IPSOS, PILLSBURY TOASTER STRUDEL POLL, DONALD TRUMP NOW CAPTURES 42% OF LIKELY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS. AND THAT HAS THE G.O.P. ESTABLISHMENT SHAKING IN ITS WING TIPS.
THE "WASHINGTON POST" SAYS INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE SORT OF MAINSTREAM, SORT OF ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN PARTY THEY ARE FREAKING OUT.
THERE'S A FEELING THAT, YOU KNOW, BOTH TRUMP AND CARSON ARE OUTSIDERS WHO HAVE ESSENTIALLY HIJACKED THE NOMINATING PROCESS AT THIS POINT. THEY HAVE HUGE LEADS.
THE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT IS PANICKING, IN SHEER PANIC OVER THE STAYING POWER OF DONALD TRUMP AND BEN CARSON.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, REPUBLICANS ARE UPSET THAT TRUMP AND CARSON ARE STILL IN THE RACE, ESPECIALLY TRUMP. THEY WERE SURE BY NOW HE WOULD HAVE LEFT IT FOR A YOUNGER CAMPAIGN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WITH THE PRIMARIES GETTING CLOSER BY THE MINUTE, REPUBLICANS ARE SO DESPERATE, THEY ARE NOW LOOKING TO A VERY WHITE KNIGHT.
THERE IS A REPORT THAT SOME REPUBLICANS ARE SPEAKING TO MITT ROMNEY.
FRIENDS OF MITT ROMNEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THERE'S A WAY FOR MITT ROMNEY TO GET IN THIS RACE.
Stephen: MITT ROMNEY! FRANKLY, I HAD NO IDEA HE WASN'T IN THIS RACE. I MEAN, HE'S IN MY GRAPHIC DOWN THERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. LOOK. JIM, GET HIM OUT OF THERE. JIM, JIM, HE'S STILL IN THERE. OH, THAT'S A MANILA ENVELOPE. I CAN'T TELL. ( APPLAUSE ) AND MITT-- THANK YOU, SIR-- HAS BEEN KEEPING CONSERVATIVE HOPES ALIVE WITH HIS CRYPTIC CAGEY STATEMENTS.
WOULD YOU RUN IN 2016 UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
I'M NOT RUNNING. THE ANSWER IS NO. I PUT THE CHANCES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ZERO AND NIL.
Stephen: SO THERE IS A CHANCE. BUT WHOEVER THE G.O.P. TRIES TO DRAFT, THEY'D BETTER DO IT FAST BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO A FORMER REPUBLICAN ADVISER, "YOU HAVE THANKSGIVING, CHRISTMAS, NEW YEAR'S, THEN IOWA, AND A WEEK LATER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE OVER IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE." THE BLINK OF AN EYE! AND BEN CARSON'S ALREADY HALFWAY THROUGH THAT BLINK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! I DON'T KNOW HOW HE DID SURGERY. IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE MARCO POLO. "TRY TO GET THE BRAIN TO YELL. GET THE BRAIN LOUDER. I CAN'T SEE IT." THE REPUBLICANS ESSENTIALLY HAVE A WEEK LEFT TO TAKE DOWN TRUMP BECAUSE BY THANKSGIVING DINNER, BY THANKSGIVING DINNER NEXT WEEK, PEOPLE STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE RACIST THINGS SOME CANDIDATE MIGHT SAY AND START WORRYING ABOUT THE RACIST THINGS THEIR AUNT MIGHT SAY. "RITA, ALICE'S HUSBAND IS FROM HONDURAS. SHH! AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK, HOW CAN THEY BE TAKING ALL OUR JOBS? NOBODY'S MAKING YOU EAT SALSA. YOU CAN STILL BUY KETCHUP! AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, ALL I ASKED WAS IF YOU WANTED WHITE MEAT OR DARK MEAT." GET HER ANOTHER DRINK. GET HER ANOTHER DRINK. THE POINT IS, IF TRUMP DOES WELL IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, THERE'S NO STOPPING HIM.
NO REPUBLICAN HAS WON THE NOMINATION WITHOUT WINNING EITHER IOWA OR NEW HAMPSHIRE.
IF DONALD TRUMP WINS IOWA HE WILL WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN.
Stephen: EYE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO--
IF DONALD TRUMP WINS IOWA, HE WILL WIN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
Stephen: THANK YOU, MORNING JOE COFFEE. AND THE G.O.P. CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND AND HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP SELF-DESTRUCTS. HE IS INSELF-DESTRUCTIBLE. THIS IS A GUY WHO DECLARED HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THEN IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH "MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS" AND "JOHN McCAIN'S A COWARD." NOTHING HE SAYS OR DOES CAN TURN OFF VOTERS. HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN MIGHT AS WELL BE "TRUMP 2016, YOU'RE STUPID AND UGLY." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S A POWERFUL MESSAGE. SO I WANT TO HELP HERE. THE G.O.P. NEEDS TO STOP PANICKING OVER THE IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP AS YOUR CANDIDATE AND EMBRACE IT. INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THIS WAVE, LEARN TO ENJOY DROWNING. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. TAKE A DEEP BREATH OF WATER AND SAY THE WORDS OUT LOUD: "PRESIDENT TRUMP." ( VOMITS ) SORRY, I THREW UP IN MY MOUTH THERE JUST A LITTLE BIT. BUT THAT'S NOT SO BAD. COWS DO THAT ALL THE TIME. EVERYBODY SAY IT WITH ME, ONE, TWO, THREE--
Audience: PRESIDENT TRUMP ( VOMIT (
Stephen: NOW, WAS THAT SO-- ( VOMIT ) PRACTICE AT HOME. IT'LL HELP PREPARE YOU FOR WHEN YOU START HEARING SENTENCES LIKE THIS: "THOSE WHO SURVIVED THE DISASTER WERE CONSOLED BY A VISIT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP." OR "TODAY, THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES WERE HANDED OVER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP." THOUGH, COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU MIGHT HEAR THOSE SENTENCES IN A DIFFERENT ORDER. SO TRUST ME, REPUBLICANS, THE SOONER YOU ACCEPT HOW WELL HE'S DOING, THE SOONER YOU CAN GET STARTED ON HIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE GREAT BURT REYNOLDS.

THANK YOU.
Stephen: NEVER DONE IT SINCE.
THANK YOU. THOSE WERE GREAT YEARS.
Stephen: THOSE WERE GOOD YEARS.
YES.
Stephen: YOU ONCE SAID-- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG-- YOU SAID THAT, "I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYBODY WHO KNEW ME IN THE LATE 70s."
I WOULD, YES, I WOULD.
Stephen: YEAH. IS THERE ANYTHING PARTICULAR YOU WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE FOR? OR WAS IT JUST PUNCHING A LOT OF PRIME? ( LAUGHTER ).
I DID THAT, TOO. BUT MOST OF ALL, IT WAS JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YES. I'M GUESSING YOU LEFT A LITTLE CHAOS IN THE WAKE OF YOUR GOOD TIME.
I HOPE NOT. I HOPE I DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY'S FEELINGS.
Stephen: NO? I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE PUNCHED, THOUGH, WITH SOMEBODY WEARING A RING LIKE THAT. I CAN ASK ABOUT THE JEWELRY HERE?
THAT'S TO PUNCH PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WELL, I'LL WATCH-- I'LL WATCH MY "P"s AND "Q"s. FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE BURT REYNOLDS STORY, HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK CALLED "BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME." THERE IS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT YOU. CAN WE LOOK AT A FEW LITTLE ART CARDS HERE REMINDING PEOPLE OF SOME OF THE GREAT MOMENTS IN YOUR CAREER? THIS IS YOUR IMMORTALIZING IN "DELIVERANCE" THE SLEEVELESS SCUBA VEST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHO'S IDEA WAS IT TO SHOW OFF THE GUNS THERE, BURT? WHO'S IDEA WAS THAT?
I MUST ADMIT, I-- I CUT THE SLEEVES OFF. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I'D BEEN WORKING AND WORKING AND WORKING TO GET IN SHAPE FOR THIS PICTURE.
Stephen: HONEST TO GOD?
I DID, YES.
Stephen: WOW.
Stephen: YOU AND HAD PLAYED BALL. YOU HAD ACTUALLY PLAYED FOOTBALL SO YOU ALREADY KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO GET IN SHAPE.
I LIKE TO GET IN SHAPE, YES. NOT NOW, BECAUSE THE BODY'S GONE.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU DON'T WANT TO POSE FOR "COSMO" ANYMORE?
I DON'T WANT TO POSE FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT LYING DOWN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELL, IF THE INTERVIEW GOES TOO LONG, WE'LL GET YOU A COT. OF COURSE, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM THE GREAT "SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL PUT THAT UP AS A SINGLE SO THEY CAN GET THAT RIGHT THERE. WHEN I WAS JUST A WEE LAD, UPPER-- AND STILL ARE, OF COURSE,-- THE MODEL OF MANHOOD. YOU KNOW, YOU WERE THE MOST MACHO THING ON THE PLANET. I WANTED A PONTAC TRANSAM, LIMITED EDITION, 1977 FIREBIRD--
I'LL SELL YOU ONE.
Stephen: YOU WILL?
YES.
Stephen: YOU ACTUALLY DID A FAIR NUMBER OF YOUR OWN STUNTS.
I DID ALMOST ALL OF THEM. YEAH, THAT'S WHY I WALKED OUT HERE SO SLOW. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M-- I'M TELLING YOU, I'VE HAD-- WELL, I CAN NAME-- I POINT TO MY KNEE AND I SAID THAT WAS THIS PICTURE. AND THIS WAS THAT PICTURE. AND THEN THIS WAS ANOTHER PICTURE. IT'S ALL FROM-- BUT IT WAS A GOOD CAUSE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS )
Stephen: LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE. WE'VE ALSO GOT-- WE HAVE YOU AND THE GREAT DINAH SHORE. THERE, RIGHT THERE.
ONE OF THE GREAT LADY S.
Stephen:  YOU KNOW, MY MOM-- I THINK MY MOM HAD A PRETTY BIG CRUSH ON YOU.
YES?
Stephen: SHE USED TO ALWAYS SAY-- YOU'D BE INTERVIEWED BY BARBARA WALTERS. SHE'D SAY, "SHHH! BURT IS ON. HE'S SO FUNNY AND DOESN'T SEEM TO TAKE HIMSELF SERIOUSLY."
I DON'T.
Stephen: YOU DON'T. YOU HAD A SERIOUS CAREER?
PLEASE.
Stephen: REALLY? YOU HAD A SERIOUS COMEBACK IN THE 1990s. YOU WON THE EMMYS FOR "EVENING SHADE." YOU WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE FOR "BOOGIE NIGHTS." YOU HAVE A CAREER THAT SPANNED FOUR DECADES ( APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU.
Stephen: HERE'S THE THING GUYS LIKE ME ARE MOST JEALOUS ABOUT. YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH JOHNNY CARSON. ( APPLAUSE ).
YES.
Stephen: NOT ONLY THAT, BUT YOU ACTUALLY-- YOU HOSTED "THE TONIGHT SHOW" MANY TIMES. WHAT WAS JOHNNY LIKE? WHY DID YOU GUYS THINK YOU HAD SO MUCH CHEMISTRY BETWEEN EACH OTHER?
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T KNOW. IT HAPPENED THE FIRST NIGHT. I WALKED OUT, AND I LOOKED AT HIS EYES... ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE LOOKED IN MINE, AND IT WAS-- SOMETHING HAPPENED. IT WAS MAGIC. ( LAUGHTER ) WE HAD A-- WE JUST HAD A FABULOUS THING GOING.
Stephen: YEAH.
I MEAN, AND HE JUST LET ME GO. I MEAN-- AND I WOULD-- I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO LET HIM SET HIM UP FOR A COUPLE OF JOKES. AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE ME ONE.
Stephen: THAT WAS THE DEAL? HE GETS TWO, YOU GET ONE?
HE GETS TWO, I GET ONE.
Stephen: THAT'S A NICE DEAL.
AND LATER I HAD TO GIVE HIM FOUR.
Stephen: DID YOU LIKE HOSTING SHOW WHEN YOU HOSTED?
I LOVED IT. I REALLY DID. I WAS CRAZY. I MEAN, I WAS FEARLESS BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T BE FEARLESS, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT?
Stephen: NO, IF YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE NERVOUS THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT TRYING.
