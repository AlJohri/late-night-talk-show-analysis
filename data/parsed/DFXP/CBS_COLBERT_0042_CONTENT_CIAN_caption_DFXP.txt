( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY, VERY NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! THANK YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, DOWN THERE, UP THERE, OUT THERE. WELCOME! WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, OR AS I'M KNOWN IN THE HONG KONG UNDERWORLD, THE PEAR-SHAPED SCORPION. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M SOMETHING OF AN INTROVERT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT IS SO NICE TO SEE YOU ALL HERE TONIGHT, HERE ON DRY LAND, SAFE AND SOUND. BECAUSE I JUST DISCOVERED SOMETHING IN THE MOST UNEXPECTED PLACE OF ALL-- THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL. ( LAUGHTER ) THEIR AWARD-RESISTANT SHOW "BRIDE AND JAWS--" THIS IS TRUE, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE-- I FOUND THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY ATTRACT SHARKS BY PLAYING HEAVY METAL MUSIC. AND IT MAKES SENSE. THE SHARK IS THE MOST METAL OF ALL ANIMALS, WHAT WITH ITS RAZOR-SHARP TEETH, ITS THIRST FOR BLOOD, AND INSTINCTIVE DISRESPECT FOR IT'S STEP-DAD, RICK. YOU'RE NOT ITS REAL FATHER, RICK! YOU CAN'T TELL IT WHEN IT HAS TO BE HOME! NOW, BIOLOGISTS SAY THAT THE SHARKS PREFER DEATH METAL AND THIS IS TRUE, I'M NOT MAKING IT UP-- BECAUSE THE LOW-FREQUENCY VIBRATIONS OF HEAVY MUSIC APPARENTLY SOUND LIKE STRUGGLING FISH. BY THE WAY "STRUGGLING FISH," ALSO THE NAME OF MY FAVORITE DEATH METAL BAND. ( APPLAUSE ) WE ARE STRUGGLING FISH! WE ARE STRUGGLING! WE ARE STRUGGLING FISH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO I'M WARNING ALL MY METALHEADS VIEWERS-- PLEASE, FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, CANCEL YOUR BEACH PARTIES. I KNOW YOU DEATH METAL FANS LOVE BEING OUT IN THE SUNSHINE IN YOUR BATHING SUITS, PLAYING VOLLEYBALL AND SPLASHING AROUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS, BUT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. FROM NOW ON, TO BE SAFE, GO BACK TO LISTENING TO DEATH METAL IN A PARKED CAR BEHIND THE COSTCO. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S ONE THING THAT I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT WILL NOT ATTRACT SHARKS-- AND I BELIEVE SCIENCE WILL BACK ME UP ON THIS-- IS TONIGHT'S SHOW. FIRST, TONIGHT I'LL BE TALKING WITH EMMY AND TONY AWARD-WINNER VIOLA DAVIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL JUMP IN. I'LL JUMP IN ON THAT ONE. I HAVE TO APPLAUD, TOO. SHE'S THE STAR OF "HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER." I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT ONE-- STAB THEM WITH AN ICICLE. THAT WAY THE MURDER WEAPON MELTS. YOU CANNOT BE CONVICTED. THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. THEN, I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH NOTED STRING THEORIST, BRIAN GREENE. I'LL ASK HIM-- ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR STRING THEORISTS OUT THERE. I'LL ASK HIM IF THERE'S A PARALLEL UNIVERSE WHERE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL HE'S TALKING ABOUT. DR. GREENE IS A THEORETICAL PHYSICIST. I'LL ASK HIM IF HE EVER DREAMS OF BECOMING A "REAL" PHYSICIST. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN WE'LL HAVE MUSIC FROM SINGER-SONGWRITER, GEORGE EZRA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE WILL BE-- BEAUTIFUL VOICE. BEAUTIFUL VOICE. BEAUTIFUL PERFORMER. HE'LL BE PERFORMING HIS SONG "BLAME IT ON ME," UNLESS WE RUN OUT OF TIME, IN WHICH CASE, HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, FOLKS, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEFORE THESE FELLAS POUR SOME HONEY IN YOUR EAR HOLES, ONE MORE THING: CAMPBELL'S SOUP IS CHANGING SOME OF ITS RECIPES TO APPEAL TO MILLENIALS. FROM NOW ON, ALPHABET SOUP WILL BE LIMITED TO 140 CHARACTERS. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES VIOLA DAVIS. PHYSICIST BRIAN GREENE. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY GEORGE EZRA.

THANKS, EVERYBODY, THANKS SO MUCH. >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, WE'RE JUST PAST HALLOWEEN, WHICH MEANS WE'RE ABOUT TO ENTER THE MAGICAL SEASON OF GETTING ANGRY THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TALK ABOUT CHRISTMAS. JIM? >> STARBUCKS IS STIRRING UP CONTROVERSY OVER ITS PLAIN RED CUPS FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON. >> SOME EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS ARE VERY UPSET THAT THE COFFEE GIANT IS DOING AWAY WITH SYMBOLS OF THE SEASON, LIKE THE SNOWFLAKES, THE SNOWMEN, AND THE OTHER KIND OF ORNAMENTS. >> Stephen: YES, THEY GOT RID OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS LIKE SNOWFLAKES AND SNOWMEN. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER THE STORY OF WHEN BABY JESUS WAS VISITED BY THE THREE WISE FROSTYS. ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ OH, JINGLE JESUS, JINGLE JESUS LYING IN A MANGER ♪ HO, HO, HO, AND FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRH AND PUMPKIN SPICE, HEY ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I COULD GO FOR A MYRRH LATTE. THIS IS THE ONLY TIME OF YEAR THEY MAKE THEM. SADLY, THE THREE WISE SNOWMEN DID NOT LAST LONG IN THE DESERT. ( APPLAUSE ) AND-- AND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE CLAPPING. THEY MELTED. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE CLAPPING. AND I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE MIGHT BE ALL FROTHED UP-- NOW STARBUCKS IS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF ANY TRACE OF THE HOLIDAY BESIDES THE CHRISTMAS TREE ORNAMENTS, ADVENT CALENDARS, CDs CHRISTMAS MUSIC, CHRISTMAS-THEMED GIFT CARDS, CHRISTMAS COOKIES, AND GIANT DISPLAYS OF THEIR CHRISTMAS BLEND COFFEE. THIS IS NICE. THIS IS KIND OF COMFY. I KIND OF LIKE IT IN HERE. AND NOW SOME STARBUCKS CUSTOMERS ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT INSTEAD OF AN ULTRA CHRISTMAS-Y CUP, THEY'RE GETTING-- THEY'RE GETTING ONE OF THESE, OKAY. I MEAN, LOOK, IT'S JUST RED AND GREEN, RIGHT THERE, JUST RED AND GREEN. WHICH COULD OBVIOUSLY REPRESENT ANYTHING-- DIFFERENT KINDS OF BELL PEPPERS, TWO- THIRDS OF A STOPLIGHT, A FROG THAT WAS RUN OVER BY A BUS-- ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNOW, IT'S SAD. I KNOW, IT'S SAD. I AGREE! BUT STARBUCKS DEFENDS THE NEW DESIGN SAYING, "STARBUCKS IS INVITING OUR CUSTOMERS TO TELL THEIR CHRISTMAS STORIES IN THEIR OWN WAY WITH A RED CUP THAT MIMICS A BLANK CANVAS, INVITING OUR CUSTOMERS TO CREATE THEIR OWN STORIES ON OUR CUPS." ONE POPULAR STORY: ONCE UPON A TIME, MY NAME IS STEPHEN. WHY DOES IT SAY DAVID? SO ONE ANGRY CHRISTIAN TOOK TO THE INTERNET TO VENTI HIS RAGE AND OFFER A WAY TO STRIKE BACK. >> DO YOU REALIZE THAT STARBUCKS WANTED TO TAKE CHRIST AND CHRISTMAS OFF OF THEIR BRAND NEW CUPS? THAT'S WHY THEY'RE JUST PLAIN RED. IN FACT, DO YOU REALIZE THAT STARBUCKS ISN'T ALLOWED TO SAY "MERRY CHRISTMAS" TO ITS CUSTOMERS? WELL, I DECIDED INSTEAD OF SIMPLY BOYCOTTING, WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST START A MOVEMENT. SO WHEN I WENT IN, I ASKED FOR MY COFFEE AND THEY ASKED FOR MY NAME, AND I TOLD THEM MY NAME IS 'MERRY CHRISTMAS.' SO GUESS WHAT, STARBUCKS? I TRICKED YOU INTO PUTTING MERRY CHRISTMAS ON YOUR CUP, AND I'M CHALLENGING ALL GREAT AMERICANS AND CHRISTIANS AROUND THIS GREAT NATION, GO INTO STARBUCKS AND TAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE SELFIE." >> Stephen: YOU KNOW, PAUL BLART MALL BRO IS RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND BASED ON HOW FAST HE'S TALKING, I'M GUESSING THAT'S NOT THE FIRST CUP OF COFFEE OF THE DAY. IT'S A BRILLIANT MOVE: WHAT BETTER WAY TO STICK IT TO STARBUCKS THAN BY TELLING EVERYONE TO GO IN AND BUY THEIR PRODUCT? SCORCH. AND, REMEMBER, STARBUCKS, CHRISTMAS IS THE SEASON FOR GIVING... IN TO ANY DEMAND ANYONE MAKES ON THE INTERNET. WHICH IS WHY I SAY, DON'T FIGHT THIS. GIVE THE CUSTOMERS A CUP CRAMMED SO FULL OF CHRISTMAS THEY'LL BE PICKING TINSEL OUT OF THEIR YULE-LOGS FOR MONTHS. SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. THIS IS IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, THIS IS A CHRISTMAS CUP. THAT IS A CHRISTMAS CUP, STARBUCKS. IT'S GOT ORNAMENTS AND AN ENTIRE MANGER SCENE HOT GLUED TO THE LID. AND YOU JUST HIT THIS LITTLE BUTTON ON THE BACK. ( BARKING ) OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S HANDEL'S MESSIAH SUNG BY THE BARKING CHRISTMAS DOGS! OKAY, THIS IS PRETTY CHRISTMAS-Y, BUT IT'S STILL MISSING A LITTLE SOMETHING-- LIKE, SAY, AN ENTIRE CHRISTMAS TREE! ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MMMM. MMM. OH! WHAT A FESTIVE WAY TO START MY DAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BEST PART IS, ONCE IT FALLS OFF THE TOP OF THE TREE, YOU'LL BE COVERED IN BRIGHT RED CHRISTMAS BURNS. DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL. WE'VE GOT EMMY WINNER VIOLA DAVIS. ( BAND PLAYING ) ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THAT WAS NICE. THAT WAS REALLY NICE. THEY ALWAYS CUT TO ME TOO LATE AFTER YOU FINISH THE SONG BECAUSE I'M DANCING OVER HERE FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE COMMERCIAL BREAK. AREN'T I DANCING OVER HERE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE GOING TO RELEASE ALL MY DANCING AS A SPECIAL CD FOR CHRISTMAS. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. FOLKS, LIKE MANY OF YOU, I STAYED UP LATE TO WATCH THE FOURTH G.O.P. DEBATE FROM WISCONSIN-- THE TALKY IN MILWAUKEE, THE VERY BLAND FROM DAIRYLAND. AND LIKE THE CANDIDATES LAST NIGHT, I HAVE A RANDOM COLLECTION OF HALF-INFORMED THOUGHTS I WANT TO SHARE. ( APPLAUSE ) FIRST UP, ALL THE CANDIDATES DECRIED WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT SPENDING LAST NIGHT, BUT NOBODY SPOKE OUT AGAINST IT MORE PASSIONATELY THAN TED CRUZ, WHO GOT SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT PROGRAMS HE'D CUT. >> FIVE MAJOR AGENCIES THAT I WOULD ELIMINATE: THE I.R.S., THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, AND HUD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: FIVE! I'M SW SENATOR CRUZ HERE. TWO DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE? THAT IS WASTEFUL. SHAME ON YOU, WHITE HOUSE! YOU, TOO, OTHER WHITE HOUSE. I'M SURE THERE'S TWO OF THOSE, TOO. AND DONALD TRUMP DOUBLED DOWN ON HIS PLAN TO DEPORT 12 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, CITING THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT SET BY SOMEONE WHO HE CONSIDERS A GREAT LEADER-- AND HERE'S THE SHOCKER-- IT'S NOT DONALD TRUMP. >> LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT DWIGHT EISENHOWER-- GOOD PRESIDENT, GREAT PRESIDENT, PEOPLE LIKED HIM. I LIKE IKE, RIGHT? THE EXPRESSION. I LIKE IKE. MOVED A MILLION AND A HALF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUT OF THIS COUNTRY, MOVED THEM JUST BEYOND THE BORDER. THEY CAME BACK, MOVED THEM AGAIN, BEYOND THE BORDER. THEY CAME BACK, DIDN'T LIKE IT, MOVED THEM WAY SOUTH. THEY NEVER CAME BACK. DWIGHT EISENHOWER. YOU DON'T GET NICER, YOU DON'T GET FRIENDLIER. >> Stephen: TRUMP IS RIGHT. EISENHOWER DEPORTED 1.5 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BACK IN THE 1950s, AND IT MUST HAVE WORKED BECAUSE MEXICANS WERE NEVER SEEN HERE AGAIN. NOW, I DID SOME RESEARCH, AND TRUMP'S RIGHT. EISENHOWER DID DEPORT OVER A MILLION MEXICANS. IT WAS A LITTLE PROGRAM THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY CALLED "OPERATION WETBACK." SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO UPDATE THAT BUTTON TO "I LIKE IKE WITH SIGNIFICANT RESERVATIONS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT WHEN IT CAME TO FOREIGN POLICY, TRUMP SHOWED WHY HE HAS AN EDGE OVER OTHER CANDIDATES. >> AS FAR AS SYRIA, I LIKE IF PUTIN WANTS TO GO IN. AND I GOT TO KNOW HIM VERY WELL BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH ON "60 MINUTES." WE WERE STABLE MATES. WE DID VERY WELL THAT NIGHT. >> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WHY TRUMP CALLED THE TWO OF THEM "STABLE MATES." IT'S EITHER A METAPHOR FOR THEIR POWERFUL FRIENDSHIP, OR DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THESE THINGS IS VLADIMIR PUTIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S THE ONE ON TOP. THE ONE ON TOP. THE ONE ON TOP. AND ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT MOMENTS OF THE NIGHT CAME FROM FLORIDA SENATOR AND TAMPA'S NUMBER-ONE REALTOR OF 2013, MARCO RUBIO. >> FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE STIGMATIZED VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. WELDERS MAKE MORE MONEY THAN PHILOSOPHERS. WE NEED MORE WELDERS AND LESS PHILOSOPHERS. >> Stephen: YOU BE WHAT, IT IS AN INTERESTING POINT. IT REALLY MAKES YOU WELD. UNFORTUNATELY-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) UNFORTUNATELY, IT TURNS OUT-- IT TURNS OUT RUBIO WAS WRONG BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY MAJORS ACTUALLY MAKE WAY MORE THAN THAN WELDERS. WHICH, OF COURSE, EXPLAINS DESCARTES' FAMOUS QUOTE: "I THINK, THEREFORE, I MAKE IT RAIN UP IN THIS BEE-ATCH!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LA-LA-LA-LA. I'M PARAPHRASING, OBVIOUSLY. SO, ALL IN ALL, YOU DIDN'T MISS MUCH LAST NIGHT. IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY, WITHOUT THE ADDED BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO HUFF THE FUMES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH VIOLA DAVIS.

THAT'S ANOTHER SHOW--  ( CHEERS ) THAT'S ANOTHER FANTASTIC SHOW FROM SHONDALAND. WE HAD SHONDA RHIMES ON LAST NIGHT. WHAT IS LIKE WORKIN WORKING IN SHONDALAND? >> IT'S THE BEST PLACE TO WORK BECAUSE SHE HAS GREAT WHITE WINE IN HER OFFICE. >> Stephen: OH, REALLY, THAT LOOSENS UP THE CREATIVE PROCESS, DOES IT? >> WHEN YOU ARE IN SHONDALAND, YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANYTHING SALACIOUS, AND I'M NOT A SALACIOUS WOMAN.

BECAUSE SHE'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET-- >> THAT'S WHY SHE'S A GREAT LAWYER. >> Stephen: REALLY? WOULD YOU WANT HER AS YOUR LAWYER? >> ABSOLUTELY. IF I WERE BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER-- WHICH WOULD MEAN I'M NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW, RIGHT? OKAY? I WOULD JUST WANT TO WIN. I JUST WOULD WANT TO NOT GO TO PRISON, SO I WOULD SAY, "YOU DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO-- LIE, CHEAT, STEAL, YOU KNOW, GIVE CUPCAKES, ANYTHING. I JUST WANT TO WIN." SO ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN -- >> YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER, RIGHT, NEVER BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER? >> NOT YET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M ONLY KIDDING. >> Stephen: YOU EVER COMMITTED A CRIME?

ONLY BECAUSE I GREW UP REALLY POOR, SO WHENEVER I WENT INTO THE GROCERY STORE, THE ICE CREAM WAS ALWAYS REALLY ATTRACTIVE. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> AND-- IT WAS IN THAT LOW CASE SO YOU COULD REACH IN-- THAT LOW CASE-- >> EXACTLY. AND THAT'S WHEN THEY HAD FROZEN BANANAS FOR FIVE CENTS. YOU WOULD BUY THEM FOR FIVE CENTS.

THANK YOU. >> Stephen: BUT, ALSO, THIS IS THE 100th ANNIVERSARY, THIS MONTH, OF EINSTEIN PRESENTING HIS GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW IT'S FAMOUS. OKAY? ( LAUGHTER ) WHY IS IT EPOCH MAKING? WHY DID IT CHANGE EVERYTHING? >> SO WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE FORCE OF GRAVITY WORKED BEFORE EINSTEIN GAVE US THE GENERAL THEORY. >> Stephen: DID NEWTON TEACH US THAT GRAVITY COMES FROM APPLES? >> THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD THINK. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD THINK. BUT ACTUALLY, WHAT NEWTON GAVE US IS A FORMULA THAT TELLS US THE STRENGTH OF GRAVITY, BUT HE NEVER TOLD US HOW GRAVITY ACTUALLY EXERTS ITS PULL. >> Stephen: DID HE NOT CARE? >> HE CARED. IN FACT IN HIS OWN WRITING HE SAID THAT IT WAS A CRITICAL QUESTION THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT HE SAID, "I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE READER." HE COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT. >> Stephen: SO THEN EINSTEIN READ THAT AND SAID, "I GOT THIS ONE. I GOT THIS ONE." >> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. >> Stephen: STAND BACK, GUYS, ALBY IS HERE. SO WHEN DOES SPECIAL RELATIVITY COME OUT? >> 1905. >> Stephen: WHAT IS WHAT YOU CALL ANAS MIRABULOUS. >> RELATIVITY IS THE MOST FAMOUS WHERE HE REDEFINED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE AND TIME. >> Stephen: IS THAT E.EQUALS MC SQUARED. >> IT WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. >> Stephen: BY THE WAY, E. EQUALS MC SQUARED. >> HE PUBLISHED SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND IN SEPTEMBER HE HAS A LITTLE EXTRA IDEA, WHICH IS E. EQUALS MC SQUARED. >> Stephen: SO THIS IS 10 YEARS LATER. AND HAS HE GOT ANY HITS IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO? >> HE PUBLISHED ENORMOUS NUMBERS OF PAPERS BUT HIS REAL FOCUS, THE PASSION OF HIS LIFE'S WORK, WAS TO FIGURE OUT GRAVITY. >> Stephen: AND HOW DID-- HOW DID IT COME TO HIM THAT-- HOW THIS WORKS? ( LAUGHTER ). >> WELL, YOU KNOW-- >> Stephen: I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FORM THE QUESTION. >> HE WAS DEEPLY PUZZLED. HOW DOES THE SUN KEEP THE EARTH IN ORBIT? WHAT IS GRAVITY. AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT THIS, THINKING ABOUT THIS. AND ONE DAY IN 1907, HE'S IN THE PATENT OFFICE IN SWITZERLAND WHERE HE WORKED, AND HE HAD WHAT HE CALLED THE HAPPIEST THOUGHT OF HIS LIFE. >> Stephen: WOW. >> AND THE THOUGHT -- >> IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SAY? >> WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR HAPPIEST THOUGHT, BUT HIS WE WITH TALK ABOUT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SO HE IMAGINES A MAN FALLING FROM THE ROOF OF A HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: HAPPY! YAY! >> AND HE REALIZES THAT THAT MAN WOULD NOT FEEL HIS OWN WEIGHT. HE WOULD FEEL WEIGHTLESS. >> Stephen: IN FREEFALL. >> FREEFALL. HE'S ON A SCALE. AND THE SCALE'S READING WOULD FALL TO ZERO BECAUSE HE'S NO LONGER PUSHING ON THE SCALE. HE'S FALLING WITH IT. >> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AN EXPERIMENT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT. >> YES, A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION. ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: YEAH! OKAY. DO I HAVE TO DO ANYTHING? >> NO, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. ALL WE HAVE HERE IS A BOTTLE OF WATER THAT HAS HOLES IN IT, RIGHT? SO, OF COURSE, THE WATER IS SPRAYING OUT OF THE HOLES BECAUSE GRAVITY IS PULLING ON THE WATER, RIGHT? >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> BUT IF EINSTEIN IS RIGHT, IF I DROP THIS BOTTLE, THE WATER WILL NO LONGER FEEL GRAVITY, SO THE WATER SHOULD STOP SPRAYING OUT. LET'S SEE IT, THREE, TWO, ONE. >> Stephen: WHOA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW. OKAY. NOW, DID EINSTEIN-- DID EINSTEIN HAVE ANY THEATERIES ABOUT WHO'S GOING TO CLEAN THAT UP RIGHT NOW? SO HE SAW, THAT HE THOUGHT OF THAT, AND THEN GENERAL RELATIVITY. >> EIGHT YEARS IN THE MIND OF ALBERT EINSTEIN. >> Stephen: SO HE THINKS ABOUT IT FOR EIGHT YEARS. WHAT'S NEXT? >> THEN HE REALIZES THAT THERE'S A LINK BETWEEN GRAVITY AND MOTION. >> Stephen: LET'S-- WE HAVE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT. >> HE COMES UP WITH THIS IDEA FOR HOW GRAVITY WORKS. THIS IS MEANT TO BE THE FABRIC OF SPACE. >> Stephen: OKAY. IT'S BLARK IT'S BLACK. >> IT'S BLACK, RIGHT, EXACTLY. HE SAYS IF THERE'S NO MATTER, NO ENERGY IN SPACE AND IT'S FLAT WHICH WOULD MEAN IF YOU ROLL SOMETHING-- SAY A PLANET IS MOVING THROUGH SPACE, IT GOES ON A STRAIGHT LINE. BUT NOW LET'S BRING IN THE SUN. THIS IS THE SUN RIGHT HERE. AND HE SAYS IN THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY, THAT THE SUN, MERELY BY VIRTUE OF BEING IN SPACE, WARPS THE FABRIC OF SPACE, ACTUALLY AND TIME. AND THAT'S VITAL. >> Stephen: IT MAKES LIKE A >> A WELL IN A SENSE. BECAUSE NOW IF WE TAKE THE EARTH, RIGHT, AND SET IT IN MOTION, IT NOW GOES INTO ORBIT, BECAUSE THE FABRIC OF SPACE IS NUDGING IT AROUND. AND THAT IS, ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN, HOW GRAVITY WORKS. SO IF WE GET THESE GUYS MOVING, ALL OF THESE PLANETS, OBJECTS-- I THINK I JUST THREW SOMETHING OFF THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN IS HOW THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ACTUALLY WORKS. WE CAN PUT SOME, LET'S SAY ASTROADSIDE, IN THERE, AND LET THEE GUYS GO IN MOTION. GO CRAZY. GO CRAZY. >> Stephen: DO I HAVE TO GO IN THE SAME DIRECTION? >> IT'S UP TO YOU, MAN. GO NUTS. RIGHT OFF THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE AGAIN! >> Stephen: I THINK I'VE TORN THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME. >> AND THEN WE HAVE SOME OF THESE GUYS OVER HERE. >> Stephen: WOW. AND THOSE PLANETS ARE ON FIRE? ( LAUGHTER ) >> THERE THEY ARE. >> Stephen: I'VE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU. EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS THIS IS-- THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL DEMONSTRATION. EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS TO GUYS LIKE YOU, "CAN YOU DUMB IT DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF, LIKE, A FIVE-YEAR-OLD?" I WOULD LIKE YOU TO NOT DUMB IT DOWN. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SAY IT TO ME AS IF I WERE MY AGE, 51, BUT HAD AN ADVANCED DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND HIGH MATHEMATICS. GIVE IT TO ME IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS, BUT LET ME JUST LEAN INTO MY IGNORANCE OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO ME. >> SO ALBERT EINSTEIN SAYS THAT SPACE TIME IS A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL HOUSES DIFFERENTIAL MANIFOLD ON WHICH A METRIC TENSOR IS IMPOSED THAT SOLVES THE EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATIONS, AND THAT METRIC TENSOR GIVES RISE TO GEODESICS AND OBJECTS NOT EXPERIENCE ANYTHING OTHER FORCE MOVE ALONG THE GEODESICCS DESCRIBED BY THAT METRIC.
