STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELCOME, EVERYBODY. THAT'S LOVELY.
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. HEY, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. DO YOU GUYS FOLLOW BUSINESS? DO YOU GUYS FOLLOW BUSINESS NEWS? YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD. IT'S WHERE THEY KEEP ALL THE MONEY. AND THERE'S BIG NEWS FROM THE BUSINESS WORLD. IT'S NEWS YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING BORING LIKE REAL ESTATE OR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT: IT'S BEER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) INTERNATIONAL SIGN FOR TICK-TICK. ANHEISER-BUSCH IS TRYING TO BUY MILLER FOR $104 BILLION. YEAH, YEAH, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. THAT'S BILLION, WITH AN "ILLION." $104 BILLION? THAT'S CRAZY. YOU CAN GET A BEER AT YANKEE STADIUM FOR LIKE HALF THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) APPROXIMATELY. A LITTLE MORE. PERSONALLY, I'M EXCITED ABOUT BUD AND MILLER GETTING TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT MEANS I CAN FINALLY STOP PRETENDING I CAN TASTE THE DIFFERENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, AGAIN, THIS MERGER WORRIES SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE, BECAUSE THIS MIGGA CORPORATION WHEN COMBINED WOULD CONTROL SPHOANT% OF THE BEER MARKET. THEY'D HAVE MILLER, BECK'S, BASS, BUSCH, CORONA, MICHELOB, ROLLING ROCK, STELLA ARTOIS, AND MILWAUKEE'S BEST. AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT A GREAT BEER, BUT THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST. IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE NAME. JUST SAY YOU LIKE IT. JUST SAY YOU LIKE IT. YOU'RE HURTING THEIR FEELINGS! ( APPLAUSE ) BASICALLY, THE ONLY THING THEY WOULDN'T OWN IS YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW'S HOME BREW. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY FOR A SECOND HERE, MAX, I LOVE YOU, BUT REALLY? LAVENDER-INFUSED, PUMPKIN SPICE, TRIPLE BOCK CHOCOLATE STOUT, FERMENTED IN A GROUT BUCKET IN YOUR BASEMENT? NO, THANK YOU. I JUST WANT SOMETHING WITH MAXIMUM DRINKABILITY THAT I CAN POUR DOWN MY THROAT QUICKLY WHILE OPERATING POWER TOOLS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK? TONIGHT'S SHOW IS GOING TO GO DOWN EASY BECAUSE IT IS A TALL, FROSTY ONE. I'LL BE TALKING WITH THE MULTI-TALENTED JACK BLACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOOO! ALWAYS BRINGS IT. ALWAYS BRINGS IT STRONG. HE'S STARRING IN THE NEW "GOOSEBUMPS" MOVIE BASED ON THE FANTASTIC SERIES OF BOOKS. NOW, IF YOU'VE NEVER READ THE "GOOSEBUMPS" BOOKS, GOOD NEWS PUP DON'T HAVE TO. THERE'S A MOVIE NOW. SO THANK YOU. I'LL ALSO BE TALKING WITH THE INVENTOR AND C.E.O. OF GOPRO, NICK WOODMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) A LOT OF PEOPLE THE GOPRO. I WILL INTERVIEW HIM WHILE BASE JUMPING OFF A CLIFF IN NORWAY WEARING A WINGSUIT. DID WE GET THE WINGSUIT? WE DID NOT GET THE WINGSUIT. THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO SIT AT THE DESK AND TALK. AND THEN PERFORMANCE BY A DANCER I THINK YOU'LL LOVE BY MICHELLE DORRANCE. SHE JUST RECEIVED A MacARTHUR GENIUS GRANT FOR TAP DANCING. SHE'S AMAZING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE'S AMAZING. PERSONALLY, I THINK YOU WILL LOVE HER AS MUCH AS HER DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR HATE HER. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, FOLKS THAT THERE IS THE STIRRING MUSIC OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: HELLO, EVERYBODY. HOW Y'ALL DOING?
Stephen: THEY'RE GOING TO KICK THIS HIGH INTO SHOW GEAR. BUT FIRST, ONE MORE THING: DELTA AIRLINES HAS ANNOUNCED NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN QUARTERLY PROFIT. AND TO MARK THE OCCASION, THEY'LL BE CHARGING YOU A $50 CELEBRATION FEE.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JACK BLACK. C.E.O. OF GOPRO, NICK WOODMAN. AND A DANCE PERFORMANCE BY MICHELLE DORRANCE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LA-LA! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S NICE. WOW.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEVEIN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS THE RARE-- THIS IS THE RARE DOUBLE CHANT NIGHT. AND I'M-- FOR LEGAL REASONS I'M GOING TO PRETEND I DIDN'T LIKE THAT. LET'S DO THIS THING. ANYONE WATCH THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE LAST NIGHT? ME TOO. ME, TOO. ME, TOO. IT WAS DIFFERENT. THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH DRAMA, BUT LAST NIGHT, NOTHING REALLY OUTRAGEOUS HAPPENED. THERE WERE NO PERSONAL ATTACKS, NO SALTY LANGUAGE-- EXCEPT FROM THE BACK WALL, WHICH FOR SOME REASON KEPT REPEATING "FCNN." I DON'T SEE WHY. I THINK THEY DID A FINE JOB. I THINK CNN DID A FINE JOB. THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. IT WAS MOSTLY THE USUAL DEMOCRATIC TALKING POINTS: TAX THE RICH, FREE COLLEGE. ONCE-A-MONTH BAGEL DAY WILL BE DOUGHNUT DAY. AND NO SURPRISE, THE SENATOR FROM VERMONT STAYED TRUE TO HIS CORE MESSAGE.
IT IS IMMORAL AND WRONG THAT THE TOP 0.1% IN THIS COUNTRY OWN ALMOST 90%, ALMOST AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE BOTTOM 90%. 57% OF ALL NEW INCOME IS GOING TO THE TOP 1%. 1%. 51%. 36%. 90%. 80%. 63%. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I WOULD NOT WANT TO SPLIT A CHECK WITH BERNIE SANDERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "WHAT IS THIS? 5% OF THE PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE ARE PAYING 40% OF THE TIP, WHICH SHOULD BE 15%, 20% FOR GOOD SERVICE, OR 18.5% FOR A PARTY OF SIX OR MORE. I'M TIRED OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SELTZER DRINKERS FOOTING THE BILL FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF MIMOSA DRINKERS! YES, I DID TAKE A BITE OF THE FRUIT PLATE, BUT I WAS ON THE RECORD AGAINST ORDERING IT. THE POINT IS, THIS BRUNCH IS RIGGED! THIS BRUNCH IS RIGGED!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GOTTA MOP UP AFTER THAT IMPRESSION. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT WAS SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAD THE MOST QUOTED MOMENT OF THE NIGHT, AND EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE IT CAME OUT OF BERNIE SANDERS' MOUTH. IS
LET ME SAY SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE GREAT POLITICS, AND THAT IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT YOUR DAMN EMAILS.
THANK YOU. ME TOO. ME TOO. ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU KNOW YOUR DEBATE WAS PRETTY UNEVENTFUL WHEN THE BANNER HEADLINE THE NEXT DAY IS "ELDERLY MAN NOT INTERESTED IN E-MAIL." ( APPLAUSE ) MIX 'EM UP! BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY GOOD MOMENT FOR SECRETARY CLINTON LAST NIGHT. SHE ALSO HAD SOME TOUGH TALK FOR WALL STREET.
I REPRESENTED WALL STREET AS A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, AND I WENT TO WALL STREET IN DECEMBER OF 2007 BEFORE THE BIG CRASH THAT WE HAD, AND I BASICALLY SAID CUT IT OUT.
Stephen: YEAH! BACK IN 2007, BEFORE THE BIG CRASH, SHE SAID, "CUT IT OUT! I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF YOU COLLAPSING THE ECONOMY, MISTER! STOP IT RIGHT NOW OR YOU'RE GOING TO BED WITHOUT ANY COCAINE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? NO, I'M-- NO! NO! NO! NO! OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE COCAINE." AND HILLARY'S BIG NIGHT CLEARLY PLEASED HER BIGGEST FAN, POTENTIAL FUTURE FIRST LADY'S MAN, BILL CLINTON, WHO TWEETED THIS PHOTO OF HIMSELF WATCHING THE DEBATE IN HIS VEGAS HOTEL ROOM, WHICH WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HIM, AND ALSO ABSOLUTE PROOF THAT HE SPENT ALL NIGHT IN THAT ROOM WATCHING CNN ALONE, CERTAINLY NOT OUT ON THE VEGAS STRIP AND DEFINITELY NOT WITH WHOEVER TOOK THAT PICTURE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE NIGHT WASN'T ALL SUBSTANCE. THERE WERE ALSO THESE GUYS, LIKE FORMER VIRGINIA SENATOR AND MAN HOLDING IN A BURP, JIM WEBB.  ( LAUGHTER) ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS-- A GOOD MAN, GOOD MAN. THIS WAS A CANDIDATE WHO REALLY DEMANDED ATTENTION.
PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH HERE FOR TEN MINUTES HERE. I'VE BEEN STANDING OVER HERE FOR TEN MINUTES TRYING. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES. I WILL SAY THIS--
YOU'RE OVER YOUR TIME.
WELL, YOU'VE LET A LOT OF PEOPLE GO OVER THEIR TIME. THIS HASN'T BEEN EQUAL, EQUAL TIME.
Stephen: A POWERFUL MESSAGE. I CAN ALREADY SEE HIS NEW SLOGAN: "JIM WEBB: LEADERSHIP FOR A BRIGHTER-- HOLD ON A MINUTE. I THOUGHT I HAD MORE SPACE. THIS ISN'T FAIR. THE OTHER CANDIDATES ALL HAD MUCH BIGGER YARD SIGNS!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT THE GUY ON STAGE THAT I REALLY FELT BAD FOR WAS RHODE ISLAND GOVERNOR AND WINNER OF THE "WHY I SHOULD BE IN THIS DEBATE" HIGH SCHOOL ESSAY CONTEST, LINCOLN CHAFFEE. HE DIDN'T GET ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS, AND WHEN HE DID, IT LOOKED LIKE THIS.
GOVERNOR CHAFEE, YOU'VE ATTACKED SECRETARY CLINTON FOR BEING TOO CLOSE TO WALL STREET BANKS. IN 1999, YOU VOTED FOR THE VERY BILL THAT MADE BANKS BIGGER.
THE GLASS-STEAGALL WAS MY VERY FIRST VOTE. I HAD JUST ARRIVED. MY DAD DIED IN OFFICE. I WAS APPOINTED TO OFFICE.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE VOTING FOR?
I JUST ARRIVED IN THE SENATE. I THINK WE GET SOME TAKEOVERS, AND THAT WAS ONE. IT WAS MY VERY FIRST VOTE, AND IT WAS 95-- 92.5--
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT YOU THAT YOU'RE CASTING A VOTE FOR SOMETHING YOU WEREN'T REALLY SURE ABOUT?
I THINK YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE ROUGH. I JUST ARRIVED AT THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
Stephen: "C'MON, ANDERSON COOPER. YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE ROUGH ON LINC HERE. HE JUST ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. YOU KNOW THE OTHER SENATORS WERE GIVING HIM SWIRLIES AND RUNNING HIM THROUGH THE SPANKING MACHINE. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I MEAN, JIMINY CHRISTMAS, STOP GIVING HIM THE BUSINESS. WHY DON'T YOU ASK JIM WEBB SOMETHING. HE HASN'T TALKED IN, LIKE, TEN MINUTES!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STILL, IT WAS AN EXCITING NIGHT FOR THESE GUYS. AFTER ALL, COME NOVEMBER, ONE OF THEM COULD END UP VOTING FOR PRESIDENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JACK BLACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, HEY! LET'S DO IT, MAN. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING ACTOR, PRODUCER, MUSICIAN, AND A VERY FUNNY MAN. PLEASE WELCOME JACK BLACK! ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS )  ( CHEERS ).
Stephen: WOW, THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH. I WANTED TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE.
Stephen: I YOU DID.
I THOUGHT THOSE FLOORS LOOK SHINY AND I'M GOING TO SLIDE AND IT JUST WENT SKID-SKID.
Stephen: IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU WERE DOING THE SLIP AND SLIDE WHEN YOU WERE A KID ON THE HOT SUMMER DAY AND YOU GET TO THE PART OF THE SLIDE THAT HAS NO WATER AND YOU TEAR THE FLESH FROM YOUR LEGS.
YEAH, EXACTLY.
Stephen: NO GUEST HAS TRIED THAT YET.
THAT'S RIGHT. I --
I WAS HOPING JOHN KERRY WAS GOING TO TRY THAT, LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO. YOU ALWAYS BRING IT.
WELL THAT'S-- YOU KNOW, I MAY-- IT'S A SOURCE OF PRIDE, MY ENTRANCE. I'M STILL STINGING A LITTLE BIT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DO YOU WANT-- DO YOU WANT SOME ADVIL,.
JUST ONE, PLEASE.
Stephen: JUST ONE? I'M NOT SURE LEGALLY IF I CAN DISTRIBUTE DRUGS ON THE SHOW BUT THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU, KIND SIR.
Stephen: ONE FOR DADDY. ONE FOR MY DADDY.
YOU'RE ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF ALL TIME, AND I REALLY WANTED TO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OH, YEAH. OH, THIS IS GOING TO BE IN THE "TRUE HOLLYWOOD" STORY.
I'M FEELING IT ALREADY.
Stephen: THIS IS WHERE THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL STARTS FOR US.
IT'S A GATEWAY. IT'S A GATEWAY DRUG.
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M A HUGE FAN OF YOUR.
THE FEELING IS FIEWT MOOUTUAL.
Stephen: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE SOMETHING TOGETHER.
IT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME WE MET.
Stephen: I MET YOU BRIEFLY AT THE TWO TOWERS. I SAW YOU IN A MOVIE THEATER ONCE AND THAT WAS IT.
NOPE.
Stephen: DON'T REMEMBER THAT? I REMEMBER IT.
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!
Stephen: NO YOU DON'T. DON'T BE NICE. DON'T BE HOLLYWOOD NICE TO ME. DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S WHY I ADMIRE YOU. YOU'RE NOT HOLLYWOOD NICE. YOU'RE JACK BLACK. YOU'RE A VERY NICE GUY.
EVERYONE IS ALWAYS LIKE-- YOU'RE ALWAYS JUST SUPPOSED TO SAY, "YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN."
Stephen: NOT, "NICE TO MEET YOU," JUST IN CASE.
EXACTLY. WHOOPS.
Stephen: I KNOW I'VE ADMIRED YOU FROM AFAR FAIR LONG TIME BUT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS DO BRING IT AND PEOPLE KNOW IT. KNOWN FOR HIGH-I HAD DEALT, KING KONG, AND SCHOOL OF ROCK AND YOUR NEW MOVIE "GOOSEBUMPS" OPENS ON FRIDAYS AND I HOPE THIS I CAN USE THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE ON TV, IT'S A HUM BINGER. I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE ALLOWED TO DESCRIBE A DINGER BEING HUMMED ON CBS. IT'S BASED ON THE R.L. STINE BOOKS. YOU PLAY R.L. STINE IN IT?
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT, THE GREAT R.L. STINE, THE AUTHOR. THE ONE AND THE ONLY.
Stephen: HOW SCARY?
HOW SCARY IS IT?
Stephen: HOW SCARY IS IT?
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. IT IS SCARY BUT IT'S NOT TOO SCARY BECAUSE IT IS FOR KIDS.
Stephen: IS IT APPROPRIATE TO TERRIFY CHILDREN, JACK?
NO, IT'S NOT.
Stephen: IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.
THAT'S WHY-- IT'S NOT LIKE A HORROR FILM BECAUSE HORROR SUGGESTS BLOOD. THERE'S ZERO BLOOD. THERE'S NOT ONE DROP OF BLOOD. SO ANY OF YOU WITH THE LITTLE TINY ONES THAT YOU WANT TO BRING-- I'D SAY SIX-- SEVEN YEARS OLD. THEN YOU CAN BRING THEM.
Stephen: YOU JUST LOST THE SIX-YEAR-OLD MARKET, MY FRIEND.
I KNOW, WHAT AM I DOING! I'M SUCH A DUMBO.
Stephen: BRING A FIVE-YEAR-OLD TO IT. I'VE SEEN IT. IT'S GREAT. HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS?
SEVEN AND NINE, AND THEY FLIPPED OUT. WE LOVED IT. WE SHOWED IT AT THEIR SCHOOL. I ASKED SONY PICTURES IF WE COULD DO A LITTLE SCREENING FOR MY BOYS AT THE SCHOOL.
Stephen: DADDY'S GOT THIS ONE. THAT'THAT'S VERY NICE.
DADDY'S STOCK WENT UP.
Stephen: HAS THERE BEEN A LOT YOU HAVE DONE THAT YOU COULD LET YOUR KIDS SEE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST SHOW I WOULD WANT MY CHILDREN TO SEE THAT I'VE DONE. IT'S APPROPRIATE. IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN.
YEAH, I'VE DONE SOME KIDS MOVIES "SCHOOL OF ROCK" EVEN "NACHO LIEB RA" IS FAMILY FRIENDLY. BUT THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I REALLY DID SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE OBSESSED WITH MONSTERS. THEY DRAW THEM ALL THE TIME, AND HALLOWEEN IS THEIR FAVORITE HOLIDAY, SO WHEN I READ THE SCRIPT I'M LIKE, "MY BOYS' ARE GONNA DIG THIS ONE."
Stephen: I DID IT, TOO. JIM, LET'S DIG IT.
LOOK OUT! I GOT YOU!
ARE YOU OKAY? EVERYONE OKAY? CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
I DON'T REMEMBER WRITING ABOUT A GIANT PRAYING MANTIS. RIGHT, NOW I REMEMBER.
GET US OUT OF HERE!
OH, MY GOD! WATCH OUT!
Stephen: AMAZING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JUST SCARY ENOUGH.
JUST SCARY ENOUGH. JUST ENOUGH TO THRILL BUT NOT TRAUMATIZE. THAT WAS THE RECIPE.
Stephen: REALLY, THRILL BUT NOT TRAUMATIZE?
YEAH BECAUSE KIDS LIKE A LITTLE SCARE.
Stephen: YEAH.
YEAH.
Stephen: NOW THERE'S ANOTHER TYPE OF THRILL, AND THAT THRILL IS ROCK 'N' ROLL.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: OKAY? AND, OBVIOUSLY, YOU MADE YOUR MARK ON THE WORLD WITH TENACIOUS D.
WELL, YEAH, OH, THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW THEY WERE WHEN MY MOVIE CAME OUT BUT THANK YOU. WE'RE STILL DOING IT, ROCKING AS HARD AS WE CAN.
Stephen: WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU-- WHICH IS BETTER THE LIFE OF A MOVIE STAR OR THE LIFE OF A ROCK STAR BECAUSE YOU'VE LIVED THEM BOTH? THE ROCK STAR IS A BETTER JOB. I MEAN, YOU GO TO A TOWN. YOU TAKE A NAP. YOU WAKE UP, YOU OPEN THE SHADES. YOU SAY, "I AM GOING TO ROCK YOU, CLEVELAND" OR WHEREVER.
Stephen: LEGAL ME, YOU HAVE TO ROCK CLEVELAND FIRST.
YOU HAVE TO. AND YOU JUST ROCK FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND YOU'RE BACK ON THE BUS BACK TO SNOOZLE-BERRY. IT'S THE BEST JOB. THE LIFE AN ACTOR, YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP AT THE CRACK, MEMORIZE THE LINES, THE STRESS LEVEL IS BEYOND COMPARE.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, WHEN DO YOU GUYS START? WHEN DID TENACIOUS D. GET TOGETHER?
YOU KNOW, WE STARTED ROCK-- WE WERE IN A THEATER COMPANY CALLED THE ACTORS GANG IN THE 80s. WE GO SO FAR BACK.
Stephen: THE OFFICIAL START OF THE "D."
THE OFFICIAL GIG WAS LIKE 94.
Stephen: HOLD ON A SECOND. '94, THAT MEANS THE ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAME, IT HAS TOOK 25 YEARS AFTER YOU FORM. THAT MEANS FOUR YEARS FROM NOW, YOU QUALIFY FOR THE ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAME. I'M GOING TO CALL RIGHT NOW, FIRST BALLOT.
OH, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: IT'S THE GREATEST ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME, OF ALL TIME!
I APPRECIATE THAT.
Stephen: YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE IT! YOU'VE GOT TO WALK! YOU CAN'T JUST TALK IT OR SING IT. YOU HAVE TO BRING IT AND WALK IT.
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY. WE'LL SEE. LEAVE THAT UP TO THE POWER THAT BE.
Stephen: I'M CALLING IT RIGHT NOW. I'LL PUT $20 ON IT RIGHT NOW. $20 FIRST BALLOT.
DON'T BET THE FARM. $20 IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY.
Stephen: FOR LESS THAN $20 YOU CAN GET A TICKET TO "GOOSEBUMPS" WHICH OPENS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAYS. THAT'S A SEGUE. JACK BLACK, EVERYBODY.
I APPRECIATE IT.
Stephen: THE GREAT JACK BLACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: FOLKS, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT, TONIGHT, EARLIER IN THE SHOW. AND ONE THING THAT I'VE NOTICED ABOUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS, EVERY TIME ONE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES COMES OUT TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE, THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO COME OUT TO AN INSPIRING, ALL-AMERICAN SONG THAT'S JUST ROCKING THE HOUSE BEFORE THEY STEP ON STAGE. BILL CLINTON BACK IN '92 HAD "DON'T STOP THINKIN' ABOUT TOMORROW." IN 2008 PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD "SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED, I'M YOURS." YOU CAN FIND THEM ALL ON THE COMPILATION YOU CAN FIND THEM ALL ON THE COMPILATION ALBUM "NOW, THAT'S ALBUM, NOW THAT'S WHAT I USED TO ENJOY AS MUSIC.
NEIL YOUNG CLAIMS BILLIONAIRE DONALD TRUMP MISUSED
NEIL YOUNG CLAIMS BILLIONAIRE DONALD TRUMP MISUSED ONE OF HIS ONE OF HIS SONGS TO KICK OFF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
YOUNG'S LONGTIME MANAGER SAYS DONALD TRUMP IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE ROCKIN' IN THE FREE WORLD.
NEIL YOUNG IS A SUPPORTER OF BERNIE STANDERS.
Stephen, OF COURSE, NEIL YOUNG SUPPORTS BERNIE STANDERS. THEY GO TO THE SAME
Stephen: OF COURSE NEIL YOUNG LACK OF BARBER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MY, MY. THOSE ARE STRONG WORDS, THOUGH IN TRUMP'S DEFENSE, IT IS ACCURATE. IF HE GETS ELECTED, IT IS THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND JUST-- AND JUST OVER THE PAST WEEKEND, TRUMP GOT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF AEROSMITH FRONTMAN AND ROOT VEGETABLE, STEVEN TYLER-- ( LAUGHTER ) WHO ISSUED A CEASE-AND-DESIST LETTER SAYING: AND HE'S RIGHT. IF ANYTHING, "DREAM ON" IS REALLY MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHAFFEE CAMPAIGN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND TRUMP ISN'T THE FIRST CANDIDATE TO GET ON THE WRONG SIDE OF A MUSICIAN.
IN THE 2008 ELECTION, JACKSON BROWN, THE FOO FIGHTERS, AND JOHN MELLENCAMP ALL ASKED JOHN McCAIN TO STOP USING THEIR MUSIC. AFTER SCOTT WALKER USED MUSIC FROM THE DROPKICK MURPHYS, THEY TWEETED, WE LITERAL HE HATE YOU.
HEART ASKED VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SARAH PALIN TO REFRAIN FROM BLARING "BARRACUDA" AT HER RALLIES.
YEAH, I KIND OF AGREE. OF ALL THE HEART SONGS, WHY WOULD PALIN PICK "BARRACUDA"? I'D HAVE THOUGHT SHE'D GO WITH ♪ CRAAAAZY ON YOU! LEMME GO CRAAZZY, CRAAAZY ON YOUUUUUUU ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE THING-- WHEN A CANDIDATE HITS THE STAGE, THEY WANT TO PUMP UP THE CROWD WITH AN AWESOME JAM, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE LICENSED IT. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MUSICIANS ARE COMING FROM. AFTER ALL, INSISTING SOMEONE GET PERMISSION BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING THEY WANT? THAT'S ROCK AND ROLL. SO TO RESOLVE THIS CONFLICT, I'VE WRITTEN MY OWN POP ANTHEM THAT'S FREE FOR ANY CANDIDATE TO USE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S GENERIC ENOUGH NOT TO OFFEND ANYONE, BUT GENERIC ENOUGH TO BE LOVED BY EVERYONE. IT'S ABOUT A PLACE I CALL "AMERICA."

THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

WELL, THIS IS FOR DOCUMENTING MY MOST MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES. SO --
OKAY, GOOD.
I FIGURED I'D--
Stephen: AS A MATTER OF FACT IN YOUR HONOR WE'RE GOING TO GEAR UP A LITTLE BIT. YOU'VE GOT YOUR CAMERA. I'M GOING TO PUT ON THE HOST-CAM RIGHT NOW. LET'S GET THAT ON, RIGHT THERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? ALL RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT. JON BATISTE, JON BATISTE HAS GOT ON THE JAZZ-CAM OVER THERE.
Jon: THE JAZZ-CAM.
Stephen: GET A SHOT OF THE JAZZ-CAM. THERE YOU ARE.
WE CAN STACK THEM UP.
Stephen: WHAT IS THIS CALLED?
THE HERO 4 SESSION, THE NEW CAMERA.
Stephen: IT'S WATERPROOF?
IT IS.
Stephen: I'LL PUT ONE IN THERE LIKE THAT, JUST IN THERE AND I'LL PUT ONE UP LIKE THAT IN CASEIMENT TO HAVE A DRINK OF WATER LATER. I'LL POINT THAT ONE AT YOU RIGHT THERE. OKAY. NOW. THAT MIGHT BE ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR, BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
THANK YOU, NEW YORK!
Stephen: HOW DID YOU INVENT GOPRO? HOW DID IT START?
WELL, I WAS --
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE EXHAUSTED!
I WAS OUT OF A JOB. I FAILED AT MY FIRST BUSINESS. I WAS 26. AND I NEEDED TO FIND SOME INSPIRATION FOR WHAT TO DO NEXT WITH MY LIFE.
Stephen: YEAH.
TOOK WHAT LITTLE SAVINGS I HAD AND PLANNED A FIVE-MONTH SURF TRIP AROUND THE WORLD.
Stephen: LIKE YOU DO.
AROUND AUSTRALIA AND INDONESIA. I BELIEVE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION, YOU-- YOU FOLLOW YOUR PASSIONS. YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN HUMANS ARE MOST TURNED ON AND MOST ATTUNED TO NEW IDEAS AND FOR ME THAT'S SURFING. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, IRONICALLY, I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR GOPRO BEFORE I EVEN LOWEST MY TRIP WHICH WAS FOR A WRIST CAMERA THAT I COULD WEAR WHILE SURFING TO SHOOT PHOTOS OF MY FRIEND I WAS TAKING THE TRIP WITH. AND I DEVELOPED A LITTLE PROTOTYPE BEFORE THE TRIP. IT WORKED REALLY WELL. AND I THOUGHT, I THINK THAT THIS TRIP MIGHT BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO DEVELOP THIS IDEA. SO I SPENT THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS TESTING AND TUNING IT WHILE ON THE ROAD AND LIVING OUT OF A VAN AND OUT OF A BACKPACK, AND TENDED UP BEING THE FIRST SURF TRIP I WAS EVER EXCITED TO COME HOME FROM. USUALLY YOU COME HOME BROKE, AND YOU HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN AND SAVE UP MORE MONEY TO GO ON THE NEXT TRIP.
Stephen: YOU CAME HOME A POTENTIAL BILLIONAIRE. WHICH YOU ARE NOW. YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE. BOOM. YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND AS A MATTER OF FACT-- YOU ARE, RIGHT, YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE? AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'VE ONLY HAD 27 SHOWS, AND YOU'RE MY SIXTH BILLIONAIRE. WOULD YOU MIND PUNCHING MY BILLIONAIRE CLUB CARD? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I JUST-- THANK YOU. I JUST NEED-- I JUST NEED FOUR MORE BILLION ARIZONA, AND I GET A FREE SUB. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU ALWAYS GOPRO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, OR JUST ORDINARY PARTS OF YOUR LIFE?
MY FAVORITE THING TO GO PRO IS MY FAMILY. I HAVE THREE LITTLE BOYS AND A BEAUTIFUL WIFE. MY BOYS ARE FIVE, THREE, AND ONE AND A HALF. AND I FIND WHILE I USED TO FILM MYSELF DOING INTERESTING THINGS-- MAYBE ALL OF YOU, DRIVING CARS FAST AND STUFF LIKE THAT. NOW THE MOST EXCITING THING THEY GOPRO ARE MY LITTLE BOYS.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE GOPRO VIDEO? THERE ARE SO MANY GOPROS -- THERE'S ONE TODAY-- THAT'S ONE BURNING UP THE INTERNET TODAY. BUT DROPPED A GOPRO INTO A NEST OF RATTLE SNAKES. YOU HAVE SEEP THIS ONE? SHOW THIS ONE. THEY'RE JUST LOOKING AT SOME RATTLE SNAKES-- YEAH, YEAH. AND THAT WOULD MAKE ME LEAVE AT THAT POINT. BUT EVIDENTLY NOT THIS-- YEAH. I MIGHT LET THAT ONE GO. I MIGHT LET THAT GO PRO GO. DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE GOPRO VIDEO THAT YOU CAN SHOW ME THAT WON'T FRIGHTEN ME?
I THINK PROBABLY BECAUSE I'M A DAD I'M DRIVEN ON KID VIDEOS LATELY AND THERE'S ONE I REALLY LIKE WHICH IS MAX RABDOU, TRYING TO GO FASTER AND FAST OR THE PARKING LOT ON HIS SKATEBOARD. AND THEY CAPTURE IT ON A GOPRO.
SLOW DOWN BUT KEEP GOING FAST! KEEP GOING! I CAN DO IT!
YOU HAVE 20 MORE SECONDS.
YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IT'S AWESOME.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST EVER. WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THE NEW CAMERA. NICK, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: NICK WOODMAN. C.E.O. OF GOPRO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS "THE QUEEN OF TAP. PLEASE WELCOME MICHELLE DORRANCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S NOT JUST ME. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE WHO IS IMPRESSED WITH YOUR TAPPING TALENT. YOU HAVE JUST BEEN NAMED A 2015 MacARTHUR FELLOW. THAT'S ONE OF THE GENIUS GRANTS, SO-CALLED GENIUS GRANTS.  ( APPLAUSE ) WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DIFFERENT ABOUT YOUR TAPPING? I HAVE MY OWN THEORIES BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING OUT THERE?
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, THERE ARE SO MANY TAP DANCERS I ADMIRE OUT THERE WHO ARE UNIQUE AND INCREDIBLE IMPROVISATIONAL SOLOISTS AND GREAT CHOREOGRAPHERS. I AM ONE OF MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO PUSH THE ART FORM FORWARD WHILE STILL MAINTAINING ITS TRADITION. SO I THINK I'VE GOTTEN SOME EXPOSURE RECENTLY, AND SO I'M HAPPY TO, YOU KNOW, TAKE THE SUPPORT, BUT --
AND THE CASH!
THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.
Stephen: I'M SORRY. THAT'S CRASS OF ME.
NO, NO.
Stephen: BUT HONEST TO GOD IT COMES WITH A BIG PAYDAY. AND THEY DON'T TELL YOU HOW TO USE IT? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO USE IT, FANTASY FOOTBALL,.
IN PART I STARTED MY OWN DANCE COMPANY.
Stephen: OH, COOL.
IT'S NOT VERY PROFITABLE.
Stephen: NO DANCE IS. IT'S DORRANCE DANCE IN NEW YORK. WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE SEEN AS A DANCE OR HEARD AS A TAP--
HEARD, HEARD ALL DAY.
Stephen: SO YOU'RE A PERCUSSIVE INSTRUMENT?
SURE. MAYBE THESE ARE THE INSTRUMENTS.  ( APPLAUSE ) HONESTLY, SO MUCH DERIEFS FROM WHAT WE WANT TO COMMUNICATE MUSICALLY. WHAT I WANT TO COMMUNICATE MUSICALLY. OFTEN CHOREOGRAPHY WILL START AS A COMPOSITION OR A CHOICE I WILL MAKE PHYSICALLY IS BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN SOUND I WANT TO HEAR. MY FIRST TEACHER GENE MEDLER ALWAYS SAID THE FORM FOLLOWS THE FUNCTION THE TAP DANCE, THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS IS WE WANT TO USE THE SIDE OF OUR FOOT AND WE HAVE TO JUMP BUT USE THE GROUND TO CREATE THE SOUND. TAP DANCE AS A FORM IS INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: I COULD WATCH YOU DANCE SITTING DOWN. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED-- ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS HOPING TO DO WITH THE NINE MONTHS I HAD BETWEEN THE LAST SHOW AND THIS SHOW LIKE I WANTED TO LEARN SOMETHING IN TAP. BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON I DIDN'T GET AROUND TO IT. WOULD YOU TEACH ME SOMETHING?
YES.
Stephen: OKAY, LET'S GO DO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IS THAT IT? DID I LEARN?
I NEVER JUMP LIKE THAT. THAT WAS ABSURD.
Stephen: THIS IS-- WHAT-- YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO TEACH ME--
I'M TEACHING YOU THE HALF-BREAK.
Stephen: HALF-BREAK.
