Stephen: THIS GUY--
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: VERY NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"" EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. IT IS LOVELY TO BE WITH HUMAN BEINGS TONIGHT BECAUSE AS MUCH AS WE SPEND OUR LIVES ON THE COMPUTERS AND THE PHONES, I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE REALLY OUR FRIENDS. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE THERE IS ALARMING NEWS OUT OF SILICON VALLEY TODAY. GOOGLE'S PARENT COMPANY HAS DROPPED ITS FAMOUS MOTTO, "DON'T BE EVIL." GONE. INING THAT CHILLING. IT'S DISTURBING ENOUGH WHEN SOMEONE DECIDES PUBLICLY THEY HAVE TO REMIND THEMSELVES NOT TO BE EVIL. BUT I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE DISTURBING THEY PUBLICLY DECIDE THEY DON'T NEED TO DO THAT ANYMORE. IT'S LIKE MOSES DROPPING DOWN TO NINE COMMANDMENTS. I'M NOT SAYING WHICH ONE WE'RE DROPPING. LET'S JUST SAY THY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD TO ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHY, JUST TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE, TONIGHT I AM CALLING ON EVERYONE TO ABANDON COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN ALL ITS FORMS. UNLESS YOU'RE WATCHING THIS ONLINE TOMORROW, IN WHICH CASE, LET'S NOT GO CRAZY. HUMANITY'S HAD A GOOD RUN AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY FIRST GUEST IS ACTRESS GINA RODRIGUEZ. ( APPLAUSE ) LOVELY, TALENTED. SHE WON A GOLDEN GLOBE FOR HER ROLE AS "JANE THE VIRGIN," A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO HAS NEVER HAD SEX. SO IT TURNS OUT, ABSENCE-ONLY EDUCATION IS SO UNREALISTIC, IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK ON TV. THEN-- THIS IS VERY EXCITE AGO I'LL BE TALKING TO FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, BEN BERNANKE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH! WHOO! YEAH. GET READY. GED READY TO FEEL THE BERN-ANKE." AND WE'LL BE HEARING MUSIC FROM THE BAND TAME IMPALA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'LL BE PLAYING A SONG CALLED "THE LESS I KNOW THE BETTER," WHICH I'M GONNA GUESS IS A RECIPE FOR HOT DOGS. ♪ ♪ ♪ DO NOT BE ALARMED. THAT SOUND IS JUST OUR GOOD FRIENDS JOHN BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE GONNA PLAY "THE LATE SHOW"" THEME IN JUST A SECOND BUT BEFORE WE DO, LAST NIGHT, JESSICA MAN DOSA BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO ANNOUNCE A NATIONALLY TELEVISED BASEBALL GAME, PROVING ONCE AND FOR ALL, THAT WOMEN ARE JUST AS CAPABLE AS MEN FOR STAYING WEAK FOR NINE INNINGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: THEY LIKE YOU A LOT.
Stephen: THEY ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT BEN BERNANKE IN HERE. BEN-BEN-BENNY AND FED. I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SING THAT FOR, LIKE, 10 YEARS NOW. FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEWS. I DO SOMETIMES. WE ARE ABOUT TO REACH A MAJOR MILESTONE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. TOMORROW, WE WILL BE JUST ONE MONTH AWAY FROM BEING JUST ONE YEAR AWAY FROM THE 2016 ELECTION. AND EVEN,000 TECHNICALLY THE ELECTION HASN'T REALLY BEGUN TO BEGIN, WE KNOW POWERFUL PEOPLE ARE LEAVING OFFICE. AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THE POLITICIANS OUT THERE TRYING TO REPLACE THEM BECAUSE THE CAMERAS ARE ALWAYS ON THE FELLAS. PEOPLE ARE JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO SLIP UP SO THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF YOU ON THEIR LATE-NIGHT COMEDY SHOWS. WHAT A BUNCH OF JERKS. UNLIKE POLITICIANS, I'VE GOT IT EASY. SURE, THERE ARE A LOT OF CAMERAS BUT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE, I CAN ALWAYS ( BLEEP ) IT. I MEAN ( BLEEP ) IT. DAMN IT! I AM SO ANGRY I COULD PUNCH A NUN. LET'S EDIT THAT OUT, PLEASE, OKAY, AND KEEP ANY NUNS AWAY FROM ME FOR A WHILE. POINT THE, THE CANDIDATES OUT THERE MIGHT NOT ALWAYS MEAN WHAT THEY SAY. WE'RE NOT MIND READERS, AND WE CAN ONLY GUESS AT WHAT THEY MEAN BY WHAT COMES OUT OF THEIR MOUTH. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE, JEB!! LATEST POLLS HAVE HIM IN FIFTH PLAILT AT 8%. WHICH MEANS ALL HE NEEDS TO WIN THE NOMINATION IS, IN THE NEXT DEBATE, FOR THE STAGE TO COLLAPSE. THE ODDSMAKERS IN VEGAS STILL HAVE JEB AS THE ODDS-ON FAVORITE AT TWO TO ONE. WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD, ESPECIALLY IF THAT CASINO IS OWNED BY DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHAT JEB NEEDS TO DO IS CLINCH THIS THING BY CLEARLY ARTICULATING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT KIND OF LEADER HE'LL BE. AND THIS WEEKEND WHEN ASKED ABOUT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, HE EITHER MISSPOKE OR GAVE US A HINT.
IT'S VERY SAD TO SEE, BUT I RESIST THE NOTION, AND I DID-- I HAD THIS CHALLENGE AS GOVERNOR BECAUSE WE HAD-- LOOK, STUFF HAPPENS.
Stephen: NOW, IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY, THE PHRASE "STUFF HAPPENS" SEEMS A BIT CAVALIER. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A BOLD CHINESE AT A FUNERAL. "I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, STUFF HAPPENS." NOW, IN FAIRNESS TO THE GOVERNOR, THIS CAME AT THE END OF A LONG CONVERSATION WHERE HE HAD ALREADY EXPRESSED HIS HORROR AND DISMAY ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS IN OREGON BUT IT WAS WHAT HE SAID NEXT ABOUT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS THAT WAS MUCH UNDER INTERESTING.
LOOK, STUFF HAPPENS. THERE IS ALWAYS A CRISE AND THE IMPULSE IS ALWAYS TO DO SOMETHING, AND THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Stephen: THAT IS LEADERSHIP-- NOT NECESSARILY DOING ANYTHING. FOLLOW ME, EVERYONE! WHERE ARE WE GOING? RIGHT WHERE WE ARE! ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET'S GO? WHERE? NEAR THAT STUFF. NOW, IT REALLY REMINDS ME OF JOHN F. KENNEDY'S FAMOUS WORDS--
"ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU. ALSO, DON'T ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR COUNTRY. JUST KINDA CHILLAX FOR A BIT. MAYBE THINGS WILL WORK THEMSELVES OUT."
Stephen: THE POINT IS, JEB BUB CLEARLY HAS ALL THE ADVANTAGES THAT A CANDIDATE COULD WANT. AND SHOULD BE DOING WAY BETTER. BUT WHEN HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THAT, AFTER 142 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS SINCE SANDY HOOK, IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOT-- HOW I CAN PUT THIS DELICATELY-- STUFF FOR BRAINS. BUT JEB'S NOT ALONE IN HAVING TROUBLE EXPRESSING HIS CASE FOR LEADERSHIP. AWNS, JOHN BOEHNER IS STEPPING DOWN AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND RIDING OFF INTO THE SUNSET, WHICH IS HOW I THINK HIS FACE GOT THAT COLOR IN THE FIRST PLACE. ( LAUGHTER ) SPEAKER BOEHNER'S LIKELY REPLACEMENT IS HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER AND YOUR FRIEND'S DAD FORCING YOU TO GO TO CHURCH WITH THEM, KEVIN McCARTHY. McCARTHY'S GOT PLENTY OF SUPPORT IN CONGRESS, SO HE'S GOT THE HOUSE PART DOWN, BUT APPARENTLY HE'S STILL WORKING ON THE SPEAKER.
TODAY, TO HAVE A MINORITY GROUP WITHIN ONE PARTY TO SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE A DEBATE, YOU CANNOT HAVE A VOTE ON THE BILL IS IN TOO IMPORTANT. AND TODAY IS THE DAY THAT SHOULD REALLY LOOK TO AND THE PRESSURE MOUNT TO ACTUALLY LET THE PEOPLE HAVE A SAY.
Stephen: STRONG, ENGLISH-LIKE WORDS. TODAY "IS IN TO IMPORTANT," "THE DAY THAT SHOULD REALLY LOOK TO AND THE PRESSURE MOUNT." IF NOT, WHO? NOW, I'M NOT SURE WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANS, BUT I AM SURE IT MEANS JUST AS MUCH AS THIS FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH HE GAVE LAST WEEK.
WE MUST ENGAGE THIS WAR OF RADICAL ISLAM IF OUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. BECAUSE IT DOES. WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME AS DIFFICULT DISCUSSION, BUT THIS WHITE HOUSE IS MANAGING THE TEKLEIN AND PUTTING US IN TOUGH DECISIONS FOR THE FUTURE. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS ALONE, I HAVE VISITED POLAND, HUNGRIA, ESTONIA, RUSSIA, AND GEORGIA.
Stephen: WOW. THAT GUY IS WELL-TRAVELED. HOPEFULLY, HIS EXPERIENCE IN HUNGRIA WILL ALLOW HIM TO FINALLY BROKER A PEACE TREATY WITH NARNIA. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, SOME PEOPLE-- NOW, SOME PEOPLE SAY McCARTHY'S TROUBLE IN EXPRESSING HIS VISION OF LEADERSHIP OR ANYTHING ELSE MAKES HIM DISQUALIFIED TO BE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, BUT TO THEM I SAY, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, LONG BEFORETIMES HAVE WE FACED GREAT CHALLENGES OF THIS NATION. BUT AMERICA IS ANYTHING IF NOT A LAND FROM OPPORTUNITY. OF THE SPEAKER AND THE HOUSE, KEVIN McCARTHY WANTS TO RISE THAT OPPORTUNITY AND LET EVERY MOUTH SPEECH AS ONE. IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE-- AND IT MOVES US ALL. BECAUSE WITHOUT A BRAVE LEADERSHIP, AMERICA WON'T BE LEFT BEHIND. I BELIEVE IT WAS RONALD REAGAN WHO SAID, "THOMAS JEFFERSON." AND THOSE ARE WORDS ARE STILL ARE TRUE TODAY. THANK YOU, MAY GOD THANK AMERICA, AND HELLO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STICK AROUND, WE'VE GOT GINA RODRIGUEZ AND BEN BERNANKE. ♪ ♪ ♪

Stephen: I AM NOT GOING TO TOUCH THAT WITH A 10-FOOT POLE.
THOUGH YOU KNOW WHAT, I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE STARTED THAT TO BEGIN WITH.
Stephen: NO, I APOLOGIZE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AS I SAID YOU'RE THE GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER FOR "JANE THE VIRGIN," CONGRATULATIONS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SOMETHING OF A ROCK RIDE.
IT'S TOTALLY A ROCKET RIDE.
Stephen: THE FIRST SEASON OF THE SHOW TO GET THAT RECOGNITION.
I KNOW. AND THE SECOND SEASON STARTS ON MONDAY SP ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS, LIKE, OOOH. A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.
Stephen: YEAH, SURE.
BUT WE'RE GOING TO KILL CAN CAN IT.
Stephen: I KNOW YOU ARE. I'M SURE YOU ARE. FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT KNOW THE PLOT OF "JANE THE VIRGIN,S" IT BASED ON A VENEZUELAN TELLO NOVA. IT'S A KIND OF COMPLICATED PREMISE. AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN, EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE WHO JANE IS AND WHAT HAPPENS.
SO JANE IS A 23-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO IS SAVING HERSELF FOR MARRIAGE DUE TO HER GRANDMOTHER'S CONVICTIONS.

Stephen: SO IT'S A STORY EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO.
YEAH, FOR SURE. AND REITERATE WHAT I JUST SAID.
Stephen: I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY.
IT'S AN AWESOME ROLLER COASTER RIDE AND VERY, VERY MUCH GROUNDED IN LOVE AND FAMILY. IT'S NICE. IT'S GOOD.
Stephen: BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOUR CHARACTER IS SOMEONE WITH THEIR OWN, LIKE, MORAL CENTER BUT PUT INTO THIS CRAZY SITUATION, YOU'RE HELD UP AS, LIKE, A ROLE MODEL FOR A LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN, ESPECIALLY YOUNG LATINO WOMEN. DO YOU FEEL THE PRESSURE THERE? DO YOU FEEL I DON'T WANT THAT? I JUST WANT TO BE AN ACTRESS.
NO I THINK THE BIEWL THING OF BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU LOVE EVERY DAY AND THE BLESSING OF BEING AN ARTIST IS YOU CAN USE ART TO BRING CHANGE. YOU CAN OPEN UP EYES. AND FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO BE THAT AS ANYONE IS A PLEASING. THAT'S WHAT I BECAME AN ACTOR FOR. I DON'T FIND IT PRESSURESOME. I FALL, I STUMBLE. I'M NOT PERFECT.
Stephen: YOU WON A GOLDEN GLOBE IN YOUR FIRST SEASON.
I'M PERFECT! I'M PERFECT, FINE! GEEZ, STEVE GLEN YOUR CHARACTER, JANE, IS SOMETHING OF A GOODY TWO-SHOES.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SAY THAT IN SPANISH? I HAVE NO IDEA.
GOOD PEOPLE.
Stephen: OKAY, SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.
YEAH.
Stephen: SHE'S A GOOD PERSON. WERE YOU A GOOD GIRL? ( LAUGHTER ) WERE YOU-- ARE YOU A GOOD PERSON.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE, STEPHEN. SHE'S VERY OBEDIENT. WERE A HAND FULL FOR YOUR PARENTS?
A LITTLE BIT. I THINK SO.
Stephen: ACTRESSES OFTEN WERE ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: DID YOU GET IN TROUBLE JIEFS A LITTLE BIT OF A WILD CHILD. I WAS. I DID GRAFFITI ALL OVER CHICAGO. I RACED CARS --
CHICAGO? OH, WOW. I LIVED IN CHICAGO FOR 11 YEARS. THE CUBS HAVE-- THEY HAVE A WILD CARD GAME TONIGHT TO TRY TO GET A SPOT IN THE PLAY-OFFS.
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
YES, YEAH, CUBS.
Stephen: THAT'S ABOUT THE PROBABILITY THEY'LL WIN. ( LAUGHTER ).
OH!
Stephen: NOBODY WANTS TO GET THEIR HEART IN. NO ONE WANTS TO, LIKE, BET. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET THEIR HEARTS BROKEN. ARE YOU A CUBS FAN?
I WAS A HUGE CUBS FAN. I USED TO SELL T-SHIRTS AT WRIGLEY FIELD. BUT I WAS A HUSTLER. THE T-SHIRTS WOULD BE 16 BUCKS, I'D SELL IT FOR 20, GET MYSELF SOME EXTRA TACO S.
Stephen:  THAT IS NOT ONLY A DEMONSTRATION THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT A GOOD PERSON. BUT KIND OF STEREOTYPEICAL.
OR MORE SO, INVENTIVE.
Stephen: INVENTIVE? THIEF IS ANOTHER WORD.
AND SURVIVAL OF THE FIT GLEFT OKAY, IF THAT'S PUNISHMENT? THAT'S JUST ANOTHER FORM OF PUNISHMENT FOR CUBS FANS.
THEY WANTED IT SO BAD. GET T-SHIRT. WHO CARES HOW MUCH IT COSTS? IT'S A MEMORY. I GAVE YOU A MEMORY. DON'T BE MAD AT ME?
Stephen: I'M NOT MAD AT YOU. I'M JUST SAYING WHATEVER LETS YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT, BABY DOLL.
SOUND ASLEEP I AM AT NIGHT.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKED ABOUT YOUR GOLDEP GLOBE SPEECH SUSAID-- YOU QUOTED YOUR FATHER.
AH.
Stephen: YOU SAID, "I CAN AND I WILL."
TODAY IS GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY, I CAN AND I WILL.
Stephen: TODAY IS GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY, I CAN AND I WILL. WHAT DID YOUR FATHER MEAN? WHAT DID THAT MEAN TO YOU?
WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD AND HE WAS FORCING ME TO SAY IT BEFORE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AND HE WOULD PULL DOWN MIRROR IN FRONT OF MY SEAT, THE PASSENGER SEAT, AND HE'D SAY, "OKAY, SAY IT." "TODAY'S GOING TO BE A GREAT DAY. I CAN AND I WILL." I LOVE YOU, MWA. NOW I FEEL SO EMPOWERED BY THAT BECAUSE I CAN DECIDE WHAT MY DAY IS GOING TO BE AND I DON'T ALLOW FOR ANY INTERRUPTION OR NEGATIVITY TO INTERRUPT THAT. IF IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TODAY, I'LL MAKE SURE I TRY FOR IT TOMORROW AND IF NOT THE NEXT DAY OR THE NEXT WEEK OR THE NEXT MONTH. BUT THERE'S NO TIMELINE. GOD WILLING I HAVE TOMORROW. THERE'S NO TIMELINE. THERE'S NO STOPPING ME.
Stephen: GINA, CAN I JOIN YOUR CULT. >CULT?
YOU CAN.
YOU HAVE TO SELL T-SHIRTS.
Stephen: YOUR DAD WAS A WELL-KNOWN BOXING REFEREE.
YES, PRETTY TOUGH MAN.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER BOX WITH HIM? DO YOU LIKE THE SWEET SIGNS? DO YOU BOX?
OH, I BOX. STEPHEN, I HEARD YOU ALSO LIKE TO BOX.
Stephen: JUST FOR SPORT.
OH, JUST FOR SPORT.
Stephen: I DON'T GET INTO BAR FIGHTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. DO YOU ACTUALLY PUT ON THE GLOVES.
I PUT ON THE GLOVES, THE MOUTHPIECE AND SPAR.
Stephen: DID YOU FIGHT YOUR DAD?
I DIDN'T FIGHT MY DAD AS OFTEN AS I WOULD FIGHT OTHER BOYS IN THE GYM. LIKE I DO NOW, JUST SCHOOL THEM ALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UNTRUE, UNTRUE, UNTRUE. BUT I'M PRETTY TOUGH.
Stephen: BUT YOU DO BOX.
DO BOX.

Stephen:  GINA RODRIGUEZ IS "JANE THE VIRGIN." IT RETURNS OCTOBER 12 ON THE CW. GINA RODRIGUEZ, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, FRIENDS, LIKE A LOT OF YOU, I STRUGGLE TO KEEP FIT AND EAT RIGHT. SADLY, I RECENTLY LEARNED THAT COOL RANCH IS NOT A VEGETABLE. ALL I ASK IS A WAY TO TAKE OFF THE POUNDS WITHOUT EXERCISING OR CHANGING WHAT I EAT OR HOW MUCH OF IT I EAT. OTHER THAN THAT, I'M WILLING TO DO ANYTHING. WELL, ANYTHING HAS FINALLY ARRIVED, AND IT'S CALLED "ASPIRE ASSIST."
THE ASPIRE ASSIST WORKS BY REMOVING A PORTION OF THE FOOD THROUGH A TUBE IN THE STOMACH BEFORE IT IS ABSORBED. YOUR DOCTOR WILL INSERT A NEEDLE THROUGH YOUR SKIN TO YOUR STOMACH. AFTER A MEAL, FOOD TRAVELS TO THE STOMACH, WHERE IT IS TEMPORARILY STORED AND DIGESTION BEGINS. WHEN THE LEVER IS ROTATED, STOMACH CONTENTS BEGIN TO EMPTY INTO THE TOILET.
Stephen: I'M SORRY. I FORGOT TO PUT IN THE WARNING BEFORE THAT FOOTAGE. I SHOULD HAVE SAID, "WARNING:  THIS FOOTAGE MAY DISTURB PEOPLE-- JUST PEOPLE." ( LAUGHTER ) I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED. THAT'S MACHINE-ASSISTED ABDOMINAL VOMITING. WHAT A TIME SAVER. ONCE YOUR DOCTOR INSTALLS THE ASPIRE ASSIST, THE TUBE EXITS YOUR ABDOMEN THROUGH WHAT THE FOLKS AT ASPIRE CALL A SKIN PORT. BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS A LOT BETTER THAN PIZZA DRAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S CONVENIENTLY SMALL. ACCORDING TO THE FOLKS AT SPIRE THE PORT IS "POKER CHIP SIZED." BECAUSE YOU JUST WALKED INTO THE WEIGHT-LOSS CASINO, AND YOU'RE BETTING IT ALL ON A SLOT MACHINE IN YOUR RIBCAGE. THIS MIGHT BE A LIFE-SAVING PROCEEDURE FOR PEOPLE WITH NO OTHER OPTIONS, BUT SO FAR, MANY PATIENTS ARE ENJOYING THEIR CHEST-MOUNTED BARF-BOT SO MUCH, THEY SAY THEY WANT TO KEEP IT FOREVER.
70% OF PATIENTS WERE PLEASED ENOUGH WITH THE RESULTS THAT THEY ASKED TO KEEP THE TUBE IN INDEFINITELY.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, A FULL 70% OF PATIENTS SAID, "THANK YOU FOR TEARING ME A NEW ONE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND SOME OF ASPIRE'S CUSTOMERS HAVE COMPLETELY BOUGHT INTO THE ASPIRE LIFESTYLE, WITH ONE SAYING, "IF I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FLUSH MY STOMACH EVERY DAY OR EVERY OTHER DAY, SO BE IT." I CAN DRINK MY BEER OR WINE IF I WANT TO, AND THEN I CAN JUST LET GO OF 30%. WOW, THAT PATIENT REALLY DRANK THE ASPIRE KOOL-AID, THEN QUICKLY PUMPED IT INTO THE TOILET. ( LAUGHTER ) THE APSIRE WAS DEVELOPED BY A TEAM OF DOCTORS AND DEAN KAMEN, INVENTOR OF THE SEGWAY. FOR SOME REASON, TAKING LONG WALKS ON SEGWAYS ISN'T HELPING PEOPLE LOSE WEIGHT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND! LAYOFF LAUGH BUT SURPRISINGLY, THERE IS ONE MAJOR DOWNSIDE TO THE ASPIRE ASSIST. ACCORDING TO ONE PATIENT, "YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO CHEW YOUR FOOD." WHAT! WHAT! COME ON! CHEW MY FOOD?! BUT THAT'LL WASTE VALUABLE TIME I COULD BE EATING! THAT'S WHY I'M INTRODUCING MY OWN REVOLUTIONARY, NEW SURGICALLY-ASSISTED DIET PRODUCT: STEPHEN COLBERT'S ESOPHAGORGE! THE MOST POSSIBLY SAFE WEIGHT-LOSS SYSTEM THAT LETS YOU EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT, HOWEVER YOU WANT, AS LONG AS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THIS. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: FIRST, OUR ESOPHAGORGE NUTRI-SURGEONS CUT A HOLE IN THE BASE OF YOUR SKULL THE SIZE OF A NOBEL PRIZE FOR MEDICINE, GIVING YOUR FOOD A DIRECT CHANNEL FROM THE OPENING OF YOUR MOUTH OUT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD. AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT MAKING A MESS BECAUSE THE ESOPHAGORGE ALSO COMES WITH A CONVENIENT NECK HOPPER. IT'S THE LATEST IN BARBERSHOP SINK TECHNOLOGY, WITH THE ADDED COMFORT OF CARRYING IT AROUND ALL THE TIME. THE ESPOPHAGORGE HANDY DIET ROD THEN SCREWS INTO YOUR SPINE, ALLOWING FOR A PLEASANT 15-DEGREE TILT. AND NOW THAT YOU'RE IMMOBILE, THE CONVENIENCE REALLY BEGINS. SIMPLY USE THE ESOPHAGORGE'S PATENTED NUTRI-SCOOP TO CYCLE THE CONTENTS OF THE NECK HOPPER BACK INTO YOUR FACE HOLE THROUGH THE WELLNESS FUNNEL, COMPLETING THE HOAGIE CYCLE, AND MELTING AWAY THE POUNDS.

Stephen: ALL RIGHT, CHAIRMAN, CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE FROM 2006 TO 2014. BEFORE THAT, YOU WERE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, AND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK ABOUT THE THE ACTION Y'ALL TOOK DURING THE 2008 ECONOMIC IMPLOSION CALLED "THE COURAGE TO ACT:  A MEMOIR OF CRISIS AND ITS AFTERMATH." WHERE DID YOU FIND THE COULD YOU REMEMBER TO PUT THE WORD "COURAGE" IN YOUR OWN MEMOIR?
I TOTALLY BLAME MY WIFE. IT WAS ENTIRELY HER IDEA.
Stephen: OH, SHE LIKES YOU?
SHE DOES LIKE ME AND SHE THOUGHT I DID A GOOD JOB, SO THERE'S AT LEAST ONE.
Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE JOB YOU DID AND WHAT IT MEANT FOR THE ECONOMY AND WHAT IT WOULD HAVE MANT FOR THE ECONOMY IF YOU GUYS HADN'T HAD YOUR HAND ON THE TILLER AT THE TIME. NOW, WHAT IS MONEY? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. HOW DOES IT-- YOU GOT ONE? YOU GOT SOME MONEY IN THERE? OKAY, HERE'S A 20. THANK YOU. NOW-- ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, WHAT IS MONEY? OKAY, DOES MONEY HAVE ANY INTRINSIC VALUE?
NO, IT'S GOOD BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TAKE IT. LIKE YOU JUST DID.
Stephen: EXACTLY. SO IN 2008, WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR MONEY? WHY DID SO MUCH OF IT DISAPPEAR?
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM ALMOST COMPLETELY CRATERED. SO WE HAD THIS TRIGGER, WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, HOUSING BUBBLE, HOUSE PRICES WENT UP, CAME DOWN. WE HAD A LOT OF BAD MORTGAGES, SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. MONEY WAS BEING LOST BY THE BANKS.
Stephen: PEOPLE WERE TREATING THESE THESE SUBPRIME MORTGAGES WHEN TRADING THEM FROM BANK TO BANK AS IF THEY HAD VALUE AND THEY DIDN'T.
EXACTLY, EXACTLY. CAN AND THEY STARTED LOSING VALUE. WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WAS REALLY BAD IS NOT ONLY THE LOZ OF THE VALUE OF MORTGAGES IT TRIGGERED OFF A FINANCIAL PANIC. PEOPLE GOT AFRAID BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO HELD THEM, HOW BAD IT WAS, WHAT OTHER FIRMS MIGHT BE FAILING.
Stephen: THEY HAD BEEN TRADING THEM SO MUCH, CUTTING THEM UP--
THE BANKS THEMSELVES COULDN'T TELL US WHAT EXACTLY THEY HAD AND WHAT THEIR EXPOSURE WAS. IT WAS LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED BANK RUN. BACK IN "A WONDERFUL LIFE" IN THE MOVIE WHERE PEOPLE RUN ON THE BANK AND TAKE OUT THEIR MONEY. INSTEAD OF IT BEING DEPOSITORS LINING UP IN THE STREET, IT WAS THE ELECTRONIC MONEY COMING IN THAT WAS BEING PULLED OUT. AS PEOPLE GOT AFRAID THEY PULLED THEIR MONEY OUT, THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM ALMOST FROZE UP AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.
Stephen: WHEN WERE YOU WHEN YOU REALIZED THIS WAS HAPPENING AND WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?
WELL, IT WAS I THINK AUGUST OF 2007, AND I WAS HAVING MY OATMEAL WITH SECRETARY PAULSEN. WE HAD OATMEAL TOGETHER ABOUT ONCE A WEEK. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
WRITE THAT DOWN.
Stephen: OATMEAL.
IT'S IN HERE, RIGHT THERE, OATMEAL.
Stephen: 2007, BY THE WAY, IT'S A YEAR BEFORE THE REST OF US KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
NO, NO, IT BEGAN TO START. THE MARKETS KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
Stephen: BUT THE REST OF US, IS WHAT I MEAN.
HUMAN BEINGS. MACHINES KNEW. WE WERE HAVING OATMEAL AND A BIG FRENCH BANK ANNOUNCED THAT IT COULD NO LONGER PUT A PRICE ON ITS SUBPRIME MORTGAGES BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD BUY ANY, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUYERS IN A MARK, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE IS. SO THEY SAID THAT AND THAT SCARED EVERYBODY AND IT STARTED THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL.
Stephen: AND IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BIG FIRM THAT WENT UNDER, STARTED SORT OF A PANIC. OVER HERE IT WAS LEHMAN BROTHERS, CORRECT.
THAT WAS IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THAT WAS THE MOST INTENSE PART OF THE CRISE.
Stephen: YOU ALL DECIDE NOT TO SAVE LEHMAN BROTHERS. COULD THEY HAVE BEEN SAVED OR IT WAS OUT OF YOUR HANDS?
IT WAS OUT OF OUR HANDS. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS. THIS WAS BEFORE CONGRESS PASSED A BILL THAT ALLOWED TO US PUT CAPITAL, NEW INVESTMENTS INTO BANKS. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPITAL AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY WILLING TO BUY THEM. WE WERE TRYING TO GET OTHER BANKS TO BUY LEHMAN BROTHERS SO THEY WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED WITH OTHER BANKS. NOBODY WOULD DO IT BECAUSE THEY WERE DEEP IN THE RED. WOO TRIED REALLY HARD BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT.
Stephen: AT THE TIME WE WERE TOLD A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE THAT YOU WOULDN'T SAVE LEHMAN.
THAT WASN'T TOLD BY US BECAUSE WE COULDN'T DO IT.
Stephen: NOBODY WALKED OUT OFFED OF FED AND SAID IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS.
WE WERE AFRAID IF WE DID THAT IT WOULD GENERATE MORE FEAR AND THAT WEEK WAS PROBABLY THE WORST WEEK OF THE CRISE.
Stephen: PART OF YOUR JOB FOR THE FED CHAIRMAN, AT LEAST THOSE OF US WHO CASUALLY WATCH THE WAY IT'S REPORTED, YOU HAVE TO GO OUT THERE SP SEEM SPHINX-LIKE. WHAT YOU SAY CAN'T BE INTERPRETED MOST OF THE TIME. HOW DO YOU KEEP A POKER FACE WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE WORLD IS CRUMBLING?
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) NO, TIM GEITHNER, THE TREASURY SECRETARY FOR OBAMA, CALLED ME THE BUDDHA OF CENTRAL BANKING, BECAUSE I WAS VERY CALM. I TRIED TO MAINTAIN MY CALM. A LOT OF-- A LOT OF WHAT HAPPENS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS IS CONFIDENCE. SO YOU HAVE TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU YOURSELF ARE CONFIDENT, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT ALL THAT CONFIDENT.
Stephen: NOW IN-- IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE, HOW MANY OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THE ILLUMINATAE?
ONLY A COUPLE OF US.
Stephen: YOU ONLY NEED A COUPLE IN THERE.
YEAH.
Stephen: YOU SAID IF YOU GUYS HADN'T ACTED, IF YOU HADN'T OFFERED THE BANKS SOME-- SOME LIQUIDITY, SOME WAY THEY COULD BEGIN TRADING, LENDING TO EACH OTHER AGAIN, THE DEVASTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIMAGINABLE. I CAN IMAGINE A LOT, BECAUSE HONESTLY, AT THE TIME I WAS IMAGINING PEOPLE CAMPING IN MY BACKYARD. AND I'M NOT JOKING. IT WAS REALLY PANICKY.
I IMAGINED IT, TOO.
Stephen: SO WHAT'S THE UNIMAGINABLE THING?
WELL, AGAIN, I-- I DON'T THINK IT WAS UNIMAGINABLE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE GREAT DREPREGZ, THE 1930s.
Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF YOUR AREAS OF STUDY.
THIS WAS MY PERSONAL AREA OF EXPERTISE WHEN I WAS A PROFESSOR. I STUDIED GREAT DEPRESSION. I STUDIED FINANCIAL PANICS. I STUDIED FINANCIAL HISTORY. AND I SAID TO MYSELF THIS LOOKS A LOT LIKE 1929.
Stephen: DID THAT MAKE YOU EXCITED? WAS IT LIKE A FIREMAN, SOMETHING IS BURNING! GET THE HOSE.
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE.
Stephen: YOU PULLED OPEN YOUR SHIRT AND IT SAID SUPER BERNANKE, READY TO GO.
I DIDN'T WANT EVERYBODY TO BURN DOWN.
Stephen: ARE THE BANKS OKAY. WE CAN TAKE THE REGULATIONS OFF OF THEM?
NO, DON'T DO THAT. WE PUT SOME GOOD REGULATIONS ON SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN. BUT THE ECONOMY IS COMING BACK. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 10%, NOW IT'S 5%. SO WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS THERE.
Stephen: CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING?
YES.
Stephen: IS THIS AS HAPPY AS YOU EVER LOOK? ( LAUGHTER )
