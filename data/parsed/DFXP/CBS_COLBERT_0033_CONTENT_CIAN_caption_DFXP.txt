WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM. AND BEFORE WE GET STARTED TONIGHT, WE GOT A LOT TO DO. BUT I WANT TO START OUT WITH A QUICK PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT, WE ARE AS OF NOW 011:35 DAY LIGHT STANDARD TIME, TWO DAYS AWAY FROM HALLOWEEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: ONLY TWO, ONLY TWO. WE ARE H-DAY MINE US TWO, ALL HALLOWS EVE-EVE-EVE. AND IF YOU HAVE NOT, I WAS GOING TO SAY IF YOU HAVE NOT CHOSEN A COSTUME BY NOW EF RESECTED THAT GOES BY WITHOUT MAKING A DECISION MEANS YOU ARE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO BEING THAT GUY AT THE PARTY TRYING TO PASS OFF YOUR SHOWER CAP AND-- SHOWER CAP AND BATH ROBE AS A COSTUME. THAT IS NOT A COSTUME. THAT IS UNEMPLOYED. SO PART OF MY PUBLIC SERVICE, COURT ORDERED PUBLIC SERVICE, HERE IS A QUICK COSTUME IDEA YOU CAN MAKE WITH THINGS JUST LYING AROUND. YOU CAN FIND THESE IN YOUR BATHROOM. JUST STICK A TOILET PLUNGER ON YOUR FOREHEAD, AND THEN PUT A TOILET SEAT AROUND YOUR NECK, AND JUST SAY YOU ARE A NARWAHL BREAKING THROUGH THE ICE. THAT'S A FREEBIE. FREE, FREE. TOTALLY FREE. BUT PLEASE, ACT NOW, BECAUSE IF YOU WAIT UNTIL SATURDAY WILL YOU BE SCROUNGING THROUGH THE SEASONAL AISLE AT CVS AND HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE LAST ROIN BOW WIG CRUSTED WITH MARSHMALLOW PEEP TBOASES. >> A THAT POINT STAY IN AND WATCHED MINDY PROJECT AND POUND DOWN THE SNIKERS UNTIL YOU CAN'T SEE ANY MORE. GET THEM NEXT YEAR. AND THIS IS A MESSAGE FOR THE KIDS WATCHING. OKAY, TURNING OFF THE PORCH LIGHTS IS THE UNIVERSAL SIGN FOR "I'M OUT OF CANDY" OKAY. I'M DONE FOR THE NIGHT, I'M HIDING IN THE DEN, EATING THE CANDY THAT I'M OUT OF. OKAY? ARE WE CLEAR? AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT TEENAGE CERTIFICATE NOT A COSTUME. PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT. SPEAKING OF CANDY, WE HAVE A INTEET SHOW TOR YOU-- FOR YOU TONIGHT. FIRST UP, OH, PEOPLE, PEOPLE LOVE SEGUES, FIRST UP, FROM "FAMILY GUY" WE HAVE THE CREATOR OF "FAMILY GUY," SETH McFAR LANE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SETH, I SAID SETH McFAR LANE, IT'S A SUN SYLLABLE NAME AND I COULDN'T GET THROUGH IT HE'S GOING TO SING A SONG OFF HIS NEW ALBUM NO ONE EVER TELLS YOU WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE NO ONE TOLD ME HE WOULD BE SINGING. THOUGH I'M GLAD HE IS BECAUSE I HEARD IT AND THE ALBUM IS GREAT. THEN I WILL TALK TO ASTROPHYSICIST NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I TOTALLY AGREE. HE'S THE HOST OF NAT GEO "STAR TALK" AN ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE COSMOS, I ALWAYS FEEL VAGUELY SINGED ON THE SIDE OF MY BODY THAT IS FACING HIM WHEN HE TALKS BECAUSE HE JUST BURNS WITH SUCH PASSION FOR LEARNING THE DEEPEST SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE. I WILL ASK HIM IF DEGRASSE IS FRENCH FOR "THE GRASS." AND THIS IS EXCITING. OUR MUSICAL GUEST IS SETH MacFARLANE, I SAID THAT LIKE A MINUTE AGO. YOU GOT TO PAY ATTENTION. OH, ALL THIS WILL BE ON THE TEST. OH, YOU HEAR THAT? FOLKS, EITHER, EITHER I AM RUNNING LONG ON MY ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, OR THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY ARE ABOUT TO KISS US RIGHT IN THE TREBLE CLEF. BUT FIRST, RESEARCHERS HAVE CREATED WHAT THEY SAY IS THE BLACKEST MATERIAL EVER. AND THE PROOF IS JUST MOMENTS AFTER IT WAS CREATED, IT WAS PULLED OVER FOR NO REASON. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES SETH MacFARLANE. AND ASTROPHYSICIST NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH! >> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. DO YOU FEEL IT >> Jon: I FEEL IT >> Stephen: YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROWD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU PEOPLE, YOU MAKE US HAPPY TO COME BACK EVERY NIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS. DID YOU GUYS WATCH THE DEBATE ON CNBC LAST NIGHT? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I'M SO SORRY. NOW I DID WATCH IT. AND IN SOME WAYS IT WAS IMPRESSIVE. IT MANAGED TO THREAD THE NEEDLE BETWEEN CONFUSING AND BORING. BUT IF I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DEBATE, IT'S NOW OR NEVER. THOUGH NEVER IS ATTEMPTING OPTION. OKAY, AND I BLAME THE MODERATORS BECAUSE IT STARTED ON THE VERY FIRST QUESTION. >> THIS IS AN OPEN QUESTION. THIS SERIES OF DEBATES IS ESSENTIALLY A JOB INTERVIEW WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND IN ANY JOB INTERVIEW, YOU KNOW THIS, YOU GET ASKED WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST WEAKNESS. SO IN 30 SECONDS, WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST WEAKNESS, AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ADDRESS IT. >> Stephen: YES, THEY OPENED WITH THE ONE QUESTION THAT NO ONE IN HUMAN HISTORY HAS EVER ANSWERED HONESTLY. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: IN FACT, WHEN I-- WHEN I INTERVIEWED, WHEN I INTERVIEWED FOR THIS JOB, I SAID MY BIGGEST WEAKNESS WAS SOMETIMES I WORK SO HARD I FORGET TO CASH MY PAYCHECKS. (LAUGHTER) BUT OF ALL THE NONANSWERS THE CANDIDATES THEN GAVE, TED CRUZ'S WAS THE MOST LEAST. >> YOU WANT SOMEONE TO GRAB A BEER WITH, I MAY NOT BE THAT GUY. BUT IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO DRIVE YOU HOME, I WILL GET THE JOB DONE. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT APPEAL TO THE VOTERS, TED CRUZ 2016, GET IN THE CAR. (LAUGHTER) AND AFTER THE FIRST QUESTION, CNBC SHOWED US HOW TO CONDUCT A DEBATE UNBURDENED BY A SHRED OF RESPECT. >> SENATOR RUBIO, ARE YOU SKIPPING MORE VOTES THAN ANY SENATOR TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. >> GOVERNOR BUSH, THE FACT THAT YOU ARE AT THE FIFLT LECTERN TONIGHT SHOWS HOW FAR YOUR STOCK HAS FALLEN IN THIS RACE, MR. TRUMP, IS THIS A COMIC BOOK VERSION OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. >> YOUR BOARD FIRED YOU, I JUST WONDERED WHY YOU THINK WE SHOULD HIRE YOU NOW. >> Stephen: WOW, THAT IS THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL QUESTION SINCE THE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS DEBATED STARTED WITH MR. LINCOLN DOUCHEBAG SAYS WHAT? AND WHAT'S THE MODERATORS LACKED IN COURTESY THEY MADE UP FOR IN LACK OF PREPARATION. >>. >> MR. TRUMP STAY ON THIS ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF PARK ZUCKERBERG OF FACEBOOK WHO HAS WANTED TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF. >> I WAS NOT AT ALL CRITICAL OF HIM. >> I WAS NOT AT ALL KIT KAL OF HIM. >> WHERE DID I READ THIS AND COME UP WITH THIS THAT YOU. >> PROBABLY, I DON'T KNOW, YOU PEOPLE WRITE THIS STUFF. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU--  >> Stephen: TO BE FAIR, THAT WAS JUST JOURNALISM 101. WHO, WHEN, WHERE, WHY AND WHAT THE HELL AM I TALKING ABOUT? BUT I GOT TO HAND IT TO THE REPUBLICANS. THEY STOOD THEIR GROUND AND THEY PUT UP A FIGHT. >> THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED SO FAR IN THIS DEBATE ILLUSTRATE WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE MEDIA. >> DONE ALL TRUMP, ARE YOU A COMIC BOOK VILLAIN, BEN CARSON CAN YOU DO MATH. >> SUCH A NASTY QUESTION, IT'S NOT A VERY NICELY ASKED QUESTION THE WAY YOU SAY THAT. >> JOHN? >> DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER OR DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER. CUZ I GOT TO TILL THE TRUTH. EVEN IN NEW JERSEY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS CALLED RUDE >> Jon: YEAH, YEAH,-- >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. LISTEN TO THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. HE KNOWS THE PEOPLE IN HIS HOME STATE ACT LIKE ANIMALS. CLOSING STATEMENTS IN NEWARK GET CHOPPED UP AND DUMPED IN THE MEADOWLANDS. SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. MUCH LIKE THE CAMPAIGN SEASON ITSELF, LAST NIGHT FELT LIKE AN UNENDING SLOG, AND BLEEFER IT OR NOT, IT COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN UNENDINGER IF IT WASN'T FOR THE HEROIC ACTION TAKEN BY THE KNIGHT IN SHINING BRONZER. JIM? >> THESE FOLKS, CNBC, THEY HAD IT DOWN AT THREE, THREE AND A HALF HOURS. I WENT OUT AND SAID IT'S RIDICULOUS, I COULD STAND UP HERE ALL NIGHT. NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH THREE AND A HALF OR THREE HOURS. WE CALLED IN. WE SAID THAT'S IT WE'RE NOT DOING IT. AND IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES I RENEGOTIATED IT DOWN TO TWO HOURS SO WE CAN GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. >> Stephen: WHOOO! WHOOO! >> Stephen: WHOOO! TRUMP 2016! Z DONALD, YOU SAVED US FROM ANOTHER HOUR AND A HALF OF THAT DEBATE. YOU TRULY ARE A GREAT LEADER AND YOU HAVE EARNED MY VOTE AS LONG AS YOU CAN NEGOCIATE YOUR PRESIDENCY DOWN FROM FOUR YEARS TO, YOU KNOW, TWO HOURS FEELS ABOUT RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: BUT IT'S NO SURPRISE THINGS DIDN'T GO THAT SMOOLTLY BECAUSE EVEN BEFORE THE DEBATE STARTED, THE CAMPAIGNS WERE COMPLAINING TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ABOUT THEIR GREEN ROOMS. >> MARCO RUBIO GREEN ROOM HAD A MOVIE THEATER, DONALD TRUMPS HAD SOME COUCHES AND FLAT SCREEN TVs. >> ON THE LEFT IS CARLY FIORINA GREEN ROOM, IT HAS A JACUZZI, ON THE RIGHT IS RAND PAUL'S GREEN ROOM THAT LOOKS LIKE A JAIL CELL. >> RAND PAUL, YOU ARE BASICALLY GETTING A CLOSET WITH A TOILET IN IT >> Stephen: A TOILET IN A CLOSET. WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T AN INSULT. FOR INSTANCE THE RNC MIELT HAVE JUST WANTED CHRIS CHRISTIE TO BE CLOSER TO WHERE HIS CAMPAIGN HAS GONE. (LAUGHTER) AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE CANDIDATES WERE UPSET. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF GUESTS ON THE SHOW I KNOW SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO FIND EQUAL SPACE. USUALLY YOUR FIRST GUEST GETS THE NICEST ROOM CLOSEST TO THE STAGE OVER HERE AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO RESERVE YOUR BIGGEST ROOM FOR THE BAND. AND SOMETIMES GUESTS LIKE AUTHORS WHO ARE GREAT END UP IN OUR MORE HUMBLE ACCOMMODATIONS. FOR INSTANCE LAST NIGHT WE HAD NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER JONATHAN FRANZEN AND HE'S GREAT. WHEN I STOPPED BY TO SAY I HAD TO HIM BEFORE OUR SHOW, I FOUND OUT HE'S BEEN PUT IN ONE OF OUR SMALLER DRESSING ROOMS. HEY, MEGAN. >> HEY. >> WITH DRESSING ROOM IS JONATHAN FRANZEN IN. >> THAT WOULD BE 11 >> Stephen: OH, GREAT. (LAUGHTER) MR. FRANZEN, WE'RE ALMOST READY FOR YOU. >> THANK YOU. BE RIGHT OUT >> Stephen: GREAT. HEY, DID YOU GET THE FLOWERS THAT I SENT YOU? >> NO, I DIDN'T SEE THEM >> Stephen: THEY SHOULD BE OVER BY THE MAKEUP MIRROR. >> OH, YEAH, BEAUTIFUL. I WILL BE RIGHT OUT. JUST FINISHING A CIGARETTE HERE >> Stephen: OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU ON STAGE. THOUGH ACTUALLY, JONATHAN, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE SMOKING IN THERE. >> JESUS, I SET THE CURTAINS ON FIRE. HELP. >> Stephen: OH MY GOD, JONATHAN, ARE YOU OKAY? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> HELP ME, HELP ME. HELP. HELLO, HELP. >> Stephen: JONATHAN, BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR, GET IN THE CORNER OF YOUR DRESSING ROOM. I'M GOING TO TRY TO CHOP YOU OUT! THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE. THAT WAS A-- WHOOO, WHOOO! THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE. BUT MR. FRANZEN IS FINE. WE GOT HIM OUT OF HIS DRESSING ROOM AND WERE ABLE TO RUSH HIM OVER TO OUR HOSPITAL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SETH MacFARLANE. >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN AWARD-WINNING ANIMATOR, ACKER, PRODUCER, WRITER AND SINGER. PLEASE WELCOME SETH MacFARLANE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. >> Stephen: WELCOME. PEOPLE LIKE THE SETH MacFARLANE. HOW ARE YOU? >> I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD AM YOU GOT MY BUDDY NEIL ON THE SHOW TONIGHT >> Stephen: OH, NEIL TYSON. WASN'T I RIGHT, YOU FEEL VAGUELY SINGED BY THE RADIOACTIVE LUMP OF ANTONIU M ENTHUSIASM. >> YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH HIM AND YOU FEEL LIKE A KINDERGARTEN. I WANT ALL MY QUESTIONS OUT IN THE NEXT HOUR. HE'S THE BEST >> Stephen: YOU EVER HAVE A-- WITH HIM. GOOD LUCK GETTING A WORD IN EDGEWISE ONCE HE HAS HAD A LITTLE CHATEAU LATOUR. >> BUT EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO TALK >> Stephen: OKAY, YOU ARE A WRITER, PRODUCER, ACTOR, ANIMATOR. WHY-- YOU START YOU HAVE OFF AS AN ANIMATOR. >> TRAINED IN ANIMATION >> Stephen: WHY DID YOU EVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT. I HAVE DONE A FAIR AM OF ANIMATION WORK, NOT DOING IT BUT VOICE OVER WORK. IT'S SWEET WORK, MAN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR PAJAMAS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRUSH YOUR HAIR, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GET OUT FROM BEHIND THAT AND HAVE TO, LIKE, LOOK HOLLYWOOD NICE ALL THE TIME? >> THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE THAT. >> Stephen: BUT YOU DO, YOU LOOK HOLLYWOOD NICE. AND THAT'S THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT THIS INDUSTRY HAS TO OFFER. >> THAT'S ALL I CAME OUT HERE FOR. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, WITH ANIMATION YOU GET A NICE, KIND OF MINI DOSE OF MANY, MANY DIFFERENT ART FORMS. YOU ARE DRAWING. YOU ARE ACTING. YOU ARE DOING MUSIC. YOU ARE WRITING. IT'S THE ONE MEDIUM THAT KIND OF ENCOMPASSES ALL OF THOSE FORMS. YOU GET A TASTE FOR EVERYTHING AND YOU WANT MORE OF ALL OF IT >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> LIKE DRUGS. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: I WOULDN'T KNOW. I WOULDN'T KNOW. >> I WOULDN'T EITHER >> Stephen: ME EITHER. >> I HEARD ABOUT THEM >> Stephen: NOW THE SINGING, WAS IT ALWAYS SOMETHING FOR YOU? BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT AN ALBUM COMING OUT HERE. THIS IS, SETH MacFARLANE. >> IS THAT A 45 >> Stephen: IT IS. SETH MacFARLANE "NO ONE EVER TELLS YOU." >> DO YOU HAVE THE YELLOW SWAS PARTICULARA THAT YOU NEED TO PLAY THE PLASTIC THINGS >> Stephen: NO, NO, THEY DON'T CALL IT THAT. A TRISCALION. >> IS THAT WHAT IT IS? >> Stephen: YEAH. >> THERE IS A WORD FOR THAT >> Stephen: YEAH. ASK NEIL TYSON, HE WILL BACK ME UP ON THAT. BACK ME UP ON THAT ONE, NEIL. SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO SING? I KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO SING, IT IS A JOYFUL THING TO DO BUT HAVE YOU ALWAYS DONE IT? >> YEAH, MY SISTER AND I DID A LOT OF MUSICAL THEATER WHEN WE WERE KIDS. A LOT OF GILBERT AND SULLIVAN >> Stephen: LIKE FOR EACH OTHER. >> JUST AT HOME IN OUR SPARE TIME. NO, A LOCAL THEATER GROUPS AND WE KIND OF CONTINUED ON >> Stephen: GILBERT SULLIVAN. >> YEAH >> Stephen: I'M THE VERY MODEL OF A MODERN MAJOR GENERAL, (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: COME ON. >> THAT'S PIRATES OF PENDID ANCE >> Stephen: THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT, THAT'S FIVE POINTS, DO YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY OR TB FOR THE REST OF THE SPER VIEW. >> I'M GOING TO KEEP MY MONEY >> Stephen: OKAY, GOOD, WELL, THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME >> Stephen: BUT THE COVER OF THE ALBUM HERE IS REALLY COOL. YOU LOOK LIKE-- YOU LOOK LIKE A COOL GUY ON THE COVER OF THE ALBUM THERE. AND I'M NOT SURPRISED BECAUSE YOU ARE MODELING YOURSELF ON-- FRANK CYNIC AT RA. >> YES, THERE IT IS-- . >> THIS IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST CONCEPT ALBUM OF ALL TIME >> Stephen: FRANK? WHAT IS THE CONCEPT. >> IT IS BASICALLY SONGS ABOUT LOSS AND LONELINESS ANLONGING >> Stephen: SO FRANK SINATRA. >> YEAH, YOU KNOW, THIS IS ALL-- NOT NEW SONGS BUT IT IS ALL OLD SONGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED TO DEATH >> Stephen: THAT YOU MADE FEEL NEW. >> YES. WE MADE THEM FEEL NEW, NEW ARRANGEMENTS. BUT THE CON CEMENT IS SORT OF AN HOMAGE TO THOSE CONCEPT ALBUMS OF THE 50s >> Stephen: HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A FRANK GUY. >> YEAH >> Stephen: YEAH? >> I GOT INTO HIM BECAUSE I WAS A NELSON RIDDLE FAN FIRST >> Stephen: OH, OKAY. >> ONE PERSON >> Stephen: MEL SON RIDDLE'S GRANDSON IS HERE TONIGHT. WHAT IS IT ABOUT FRANK, LIKE HOW FAR DO YOU TAKE THE FRANK THING. DO YOU MODEL YOURSELF ON HIM ANY OTHER WAY. IF THIS THIS DOESN'T GO WELL DO YOU. >> I'M NOT GOING TO HIT YOU, KNOW. BUT-- NO, ITS--  >> Stephen: WILL YOU EAT SCRAMBLED EGGS OFF MY BARE CHEST. >> EXACTLY. I MEAN LET'S JUST SEE HOW IT GOES >> Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I WILL WAX JUST IN CASE. >> I ALREADY FEEL REALLY CLOSE TO YOU. AND THAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR ME >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. WELL, THESE SONGS, THESE ARE LITTLE SONG BIRDS, A LITTLE BIT DOWN. >> YEAH >> Stephen: THEY ARE ABOUT BETRAYAL AND LONELINESS. ARE YOU OKAY? >> I AM NOW, YOU KNOW. >> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING YOUR WATER? >> IT'S VERY GOOD, STEPHEN >> Stephen: ME TOO. >> YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL STAFF >> Stephen: YEAH, DADDY'S WATER BURNED. >> HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY TOUCH CUPS >> Stephen: NO, I AM A GERMOFOAB. >> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. >> FINE, I UNDERSTAND >> Stephen: SO WOULD YOU WANT YOUR OWN RAT PACK? DO YOU HAVE LIKE. >> YOU KNOW, I LOVE SOL TEUD. I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF, I TEND TO VEER TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE >> Stephen: THAT IS GREAT FOR ANIMATORS. >> THAT'S PROBABLY WHY >> Stephen: AGAIN, WHY DID YOU EVER LEAVE YOUR FIRST LOVE. >> I DON'T KNOW. YOU ARE MAKING ME DOUBT EVERYTHING ABOUT MYSELF. I'M SO UNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW. >> Stephen: THAT'S MY JOB. >> I CAME OUT HERE LOOKING FOR A GOOD TIME AND NOW I-- >> Stephen: THE GIFT GOD GAVE ME, MAKE THEM DOUBT THEMSELVES. >> YEAH. (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELL, SETD, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE, WILL YOU DO A SONG LATER. >> SURE, YEAH >> Stephen: STICK AROUND, WE'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE BY THE GREAT SETH MacFARLANE. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. THANKS, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW 4R5DEES AND GENTLEMEN, THESE DAYS THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION COMING AT US WITH THE INTERNET AND THE TWITTERNET AND THE SKYNET. RECEIVING ALL THIS DATA IS LIKE DRINKING FROM A FIRE HOSE. AND MY GOAL FOR THIS SHOW IS TO CURATE THAT MASSIVE INFORMATION COMING AT YOU EVERY DAY AND NARROW IT DOWN TO ONLY EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE. THIS IS FOCUS ON THE UNIVERSE. Z (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: THIS IS THE UNIVERSE. HOME OF THE WHOPPER. I AM YOUR HOST, STEPHEN DEGRASS COLBERT. YES. DEGRASSE, TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T COPYRIGHT A MIDDLE NAME. HERE ABOARD MY SHIP OF THE IMAGINATION, THE GREENSCREEN 5,000. WE ARE FREE FROM THE CONSTRAINTS OF SPACE AND TIME. USING THESE CONTROLS, A WARP FIELD NEURALIZER AND A HOT GLUED SPEAK N SPELL. WE CAN TRAVEL ANYWHERE OUR IMAGINATION LEADS US. AS LONG AS MY GRAPHICS TEAM CAN CRANK IT OUT IN AN AFTERNOON. TOGETHER MY VEST AND I WILL EXPLORE ALL THE WONDERS OF SPACE. THE RINGS OF SATURN. THE CRAB NEB YOU LAW-- NEBULA. THE OLD HVO LOGO. I FEEL SO INSIGNIFICANT! TONIGHT TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT, WE VISIT OUR NEIGHBOR MARS. OKAY, SORRY, WHOOPS, I OVERSHOT IT A LITTLE BIT, LET ME JUST BACK UP. AND WE A ARRIVE AT THE RED PLANET, MARS. NAME FOR THE ANCIENT ROMAN GOD OF WARS FAVORITE CANDY BAR. MARS HAS LONG BEEN THOUGHT OF AS AN ARIST DUSTY HELLSCAPE WHERE NO ONE WOULD WANT TO LIVE, WHICH WHY IT IS OFF CALLED THE TUCSON OF SPACE BUT AN EXCITING DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE ON MARS, BOX OFFICE MAGIC FOR MATT DAMON. ALSO, NASA SCIENTISTS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE FOUND FLOWING WATER ON MARS THANKS TO THE SEASONAL CHANGES IN DARK STREAKS SHOWN HERE WHICH ARE KNOWN AS RECURRING SLOPE LINEAE BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH NICER THAN PLANETARY STRETCH MARKS. SO HOW CAN THERE BE WATER ON MARS? EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT DURING THE NIGHT TIME THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET BECOMES COVERED WITH SALTY PUDDLES. BUT WHERE DO THESE AMAZING POOLS OF INCREDIBLE LIQUID UNBELIEVABLY COME FROM? OUR TOP PUDDLE THER RESTS BELIEVE THAT DESPITE TEMPERATURES THAT REACH 60 BELOW ZERO, VAPOR FROM MARCH'S ATMOSPHERE MIXES WITH SALT FROM MARTIAN SOIL TO FORM A LIQUID BRINE WHICH MEANS IF MARS IS EVER COLONIZED BY HIPSTERS THE PICKLES WILL BE AMAZING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW THESE SALTY PUDDLES FIRST CAME TO MY ATTENTION IN A CNN.COM ARTICLE WITH THE HEADLINE "MARS WEEPS AT NIGHT." THIS DISCOVERY RAISES SO MANY QUESTIONS LIKE IS THERE LIFE ON MARS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR MAN'S PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND IS EVERYTHING OKAY WITH THE HEADLINE GUY AT CNN? (LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY. BUDDY, YOU ARE WORRYING US. MARS WEEPS AT NIGHT? I ASSUME YOU WERE JUST BEING POETIC BUT THOSE OF US THAT LOVED YOU ARE WORRIED WE'LL START SEEING HEAD LIKES LIKE JUP TER AND IO LOCKED IN LOVELESS MARRIAGE. SPACE SHUTTLE SEEMS COLD AND DISTANT AFTER RETURNING FROM BUSINESS TRIP. OR BLACK HOLE DRAGS FRIENDS AN FAMILY INTO BOTTOM LIKE SPIRAL OF CODEPENDENCY. WELL, THAT IS IT FOR FOCUS ON THE UNIVERSE. REMEMBER, TAKE A MOMENT EVERY DAY TO GAZE UP AT THE STARS AND CON TELL PLATE WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN. NOT ONLY IS IT AWE-INSPIRING BUT IT ADDS AN ELEMENT OF DANGER TO YOUR DRIVE HOME FROM WORK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH NEIL TYSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM AT THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. PLEASE WELCOME NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. (APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU. >> HEY. THE LAST TIME I WAS IN THIS THEATER IT WAS ED SULLIVAN AND I SAW THE FIFTH DIMENSION AND JOAN RIVERS PERFORM, I WAS LIKE IN THE 8th ROW BACK AS A KID >> Stephen: WHEN ED SULLIVAN WAS HERE. >> THAT'S HOW OLD I AM >> Stephen: WOW. YOU SAW WHO? >> I SAW JOAN RIVERS PERFORM AS WELL AS THE FIFTH DIMENSION. AND OF COURSE LET THE SUNSHINE IN, AGE OF AQUARIUS, HAIR WAS ON BROADWAY, IT WAS A ROCKING TIME >> Stephen: THAT IS INCREDIBLE. I'M INCREDIBLY JEALOUS OF YOU. AND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO THANKS FOR COMING HERE. >> THANK YOU >> Stephen: YOU ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE GUESTS. >> 13, ACTUALLY >> Stephen: I WAS TRYING TO BEAT THAT RECORD WITH THE NEW SHOW. BECAUSE HAVING YOU ON, I'VE GOT TO SAY FOR ME IS LIKE A VACATION. BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, BECAUSE YOU JUST, YOU GO, YOU BURN, IT'S LIKE IT'S YOUR TALK SHOW WHICH IS NOT SUR PLIESING BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE A TALK SHOW. >> YEAH, IT TURNED OUT THAT WAY. I JUST START LIFE SAYING I WANT TO HAVE A TALK SHOW BUT WE ENDED UP HAVING A TALK SHOW AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FIRST TALK SHOW ON SCIENCE EVER IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. IT WAS LIKE WHOA, THEN IT GOT EM KNEE, IT DIDN'T WIN BUT IT GOT NOTICED >> Stephen: YOU GOT A PEABODY. >> COSMOS GOT A PEABODY AWARD. YEAH, THANK YOU. >> Stephen: THAT WAS PRODUCED BY OUR FRIEND SETH MacFARLANE. >> COEXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF COSMOS >> Stephen: INCREDIBLE. >> ANN GILLIAN AND SO YES, IT'S QUITE A-- SHE IS LIKE THE SOUL OF THAT. SHE WAS THERE FOR THE FIRST ONE >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> BACK IN 1980. SO KEEPING THE UNIVERSE ROLLING >> Stephen: YOUR NEW SHOW IS CALLED "STAR TALK" ON NAT GEO 11:00 ON SUNDAYS. >> SUNDAY NIGHTS, YEAH >> Stephen: WHAT IS LIKE A PERFECT GUEST FOR YOU ON YOURS? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE NEIL TYSON ON, UNFORTUNATELY. >> NO >> Stephen: WHO IS A PERFECT GUEST. >> FOR ME A PERFECT GUEST IS SOMEONE WITHOUT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD NO IDEA HAD A TENDER GEEK UNDERBELLY. THAT DURING-- >> Stephen: WAIT, PLEASE DON'T DO THE-- . >> THAT'S TOO TENDER. >> NO, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS SEASON, I HAVE DAVID CROSS BEE. AND MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW, I CERTAINLY DIDN'T, THAT HIS-- ALL HIS EARLY LIFE HE WAS A RABID FAN OF SCIENCE FICTION, BEFORE HE EVER WROTE A NOTE OF MUSIC OR SONG. AND >> Stephen: I KNEW ABOUT HIS UNDERBELLY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A GEEK UNDERBELLY. >> I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE, WOULD ANYONE ELSE ASK HIM THAT OR CARE ABOUT IT? I CARED ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE HE SAID THAT IS HOW HE GETS TO THINK ABOUT TOMORROW. AND WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT TOMORROW IF NOT SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS >> Stephen: YOU KNOW, I'M A BIG FAN OF SCIENCE FICTION, I READ A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID AND A LOT OF POPULAR SCIENCE, I READ A LOT OF SAGAN. >> YEAH, UH-HUH >> Stephen: I'M SUPEREXCITED ABOUT WATER ON MARS. >> YEAH, IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD. (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: IS THERE ANY HOPE. >> LIQUID WATER ON MARS >> Stephen: SO IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR LIFE? DO YOU THINK WE'LL FIND LIFE WITHIN OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM? BECAUSE ANYWHERE WATER HERE, THERE IS LIFE. >> YEAH SO FOLLOW THE WATER IS THE MANTRA OF NASA. FOLLOW THE LIQUID WATER AND ANYWHERE ON EARTH, WHERE THERE IS LIQUID WATER, THERE IS LIFE. AND EVEN THE DEAD SEA HAS MY ROBE EEL LIFE THAT IS EVIDENCE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NAMED THE DEAD SEA DIDN'T HAVE A MICROSCOPE BECAUSE HEY THERE IS STUFF DOING THE BACK STROKE IN THE POND WATER HERE. SO LIQUID WATER, YES, IT IS A BIAS AND A RECOGNIZED BIAS BUT WHY NOT LOOK FOR WHAT WE KNOW. LIFE AS WE KNOW IT. SO WATER ON MARS, WATER ON EU ROPA ONE OF THE MOONS OF JEUP TER KEPT WARM BY THE GRAPH TAITIONAL STRESS, THEU NDU LATIONS OF-- >> Stephen: AGAIN, ARE YOU GETTING CLOSE TO THE TENDER UNDERBELL. YOU MAKE SCIENCE KIND OF SEXY, I GOT TO SAY. SCIENCE IS NAUGHTY WITH NEIL TYSON. THAT IS-- THAT IS NOT A BAD SHOW. THAT CAN BE YOUR NEXT SHOW. >> THE UNIVERSE AFTER HOURS. >> Stephen: EXACTLY. >> SO THE GRAVITY FROM JEUP TER STRESSING THE SHAPE OF EUR OPENA ALONG WITH OTHER MOONS TUGGING ON IT, SO THAT SHAPE UNDULATES AND IS PUMPING ENERGY INTO IT, MELTING THE ICEK WELL OUTSIDE OF THE GOLDI LOCK ZONE >> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT SATURN'S WITH. >> INCELIDS >> Stephen: THEY ARE SAYING IT MIGHT HAVE A GLOBAL OCEAN OF WATER UNDER ITS CRUST OF ICE. >> IT IS ONE OF MANY OF WHAT WE CALL THE ICY MOONS OF THE OUTER SOLAR SYSTEM. AND IF YOU HAVE AN OCEAN THAT HAS BEEN LIQUID FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS, COME ON. >> Stephen: COME ON. >> AS I SAID MANY TIMES, I WANT TO GO ICE FISHING ON EU ROPA, SEE WHAT SWIMS UP TO THE CAMERA LENS AND LICKS IT. MY FAVORITE PART IS IF YOU FIND LIFE THERE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? ANGRY OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO CALL IT EUROPEANS, RIGHT? THAT'S HOW THAT WOULD FOLLOW >> Stephen: LISTEN, WE HAVE A TON MORE TO TALK ABOUT. >> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KICK YOU OUT >> Stephen: NO, I'M NOT GOING TO KICK YOU OUT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON AND FRIEND. >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE BACK HERE SITDING DOWN WITH A FRIEND NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON AND JOINED BY HIS FRIEND SETH MacFARLANE. SETH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BACK. YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY OUT THE DOOR, YOU WEREN'T EVEN GOING TO DO THE SONG. SO OKAY, NOW HOW DO YOU KNOW EACH OTHER? HAS NEIL EVER STROKED YOUR NERD UNDERBELLY? HAS HE SEEN IT? HAS HE SEEN-- . >> THAT IS THE SECRET, A MAN WHO CAN TALK ABOUT JEUP TER'S GRAPH TAITIONAL PULL WHILE HE IS PANTOMIMING THE NEEDING OF BUTTTOCKS, AMERICA'S ONLY HOPE >> Stephen: SO YOU ARE A SCIENCE FAN TOO. >> YES, YES. >> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT JUST LOOK AT HIS CHARACTER STUIE, HE INVENTED TIME MACHINE,-- MACHINE. CHECK IT OUT >> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SUBJECT THAT SET A LOT OF PEOPLE-- LET'S TALK ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE EXCITED A STAR KIC8465852. A LOT OF FANS OUT THERE TONIGHT. THE KEPLER, EXPLAIN WHAT THE TELESCOPE IS. >> A TELESCOPE CONCEIVED, DESIGNED AND LAUNCHED WITH ONE PURPOSE IN MIND, TO FIND EARTH LIKE PLANETS ORBITING SUN-LIKE STARS >> Stephen: AND THEY DO IT SHALL WITH WSH. >> AND THERE SAY CATALOG OF NEARLY 2,000 >> Stephen: AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A TRANSITY, A PLANET GOING BETWEEN US AND THE STAR THAT DIMS. >> YOU WILL NOTTEE A PLANET REFLECTING ITS LIGHT NEXT TO IT, IT IS LIKE LOOKING LIKE A FIRE FLY NEXT TO A HOLLYWOOD-- >> Stephen: NEXT TO SETH MacFARLANE. >> IF YOU WATCH THE PLANET MOVE IN FRONT OF THE STAR AND WHAT IS THE LIGHT OF THE STAR DIP IN ITS INTENSITY. >> Stephen: BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. >> IT HAS STUFF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS >> Stephen: IT IS DIMMING BY 22%, NOT LIKE 1%, IT IS A BIG DIP AND IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY. >> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS >> Stephen: RIGHT. AND ONE THING HAS BEEN THROWN OUT THERE, HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS. >> YEAH >> Stephen: TELL THE PEOPLE. >> Z THEY THINK IT'S SIGH SIGH BORG >> Stephen: THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE AN ALIEN MEGA STRUCTURE IS ONE, UNLIKELY BUT POSSIBLE ANSWER. >> EXCUSE ME >> Stephen: YEAH. >> YES, YES >> Stephen: THE PROMISING YOUNG MAN IN THE FRONT ROW. >> JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT, DOES NOT MEAN IT'S ALIENS >> Stephen: IT COULD BE GOD. >> I READ THIS ON BUZZ FEED >> Stephen: I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS, MY FRIEND. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S THE RING WORLD, OKAY. THAT IS FROM THE CLASSIC 1907 LARRY NIFEN NOVEL RING WORLD, A RING OF MATERIAL 93 MILLION MILES IN ITS RADIUS WITH SHADOW SQUARES TO CREATE DAY AND NIGHT CHECKS ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT YOU LIVE ON THE INSIDE, IT SPINS AT 770 MILES PER SECRETARY, ONE GRAFERRITY OUTWARD, THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE INSIDE. WE FOUND THE RING WORLD. >> OR WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS >> Stephen: IT'S THE RING WORLD. I HAVE A PICTURE. I HAVE A PICTURE OF IT. >> WHAT ABOUT THE COME ET THAT IS GIVING OUT ALCOHOL, THAT IS REAL. >> LOVEJOY. >> I CALL ALL THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE, CHEMISTRY IS NOT JUST AN EARTH SURFACE PHENOMENON. IN THE UNIVERSE THERE ARE AMINO ACIDS, OTHER ORGANIC MOLECULES >> Stephen: SO PATRONIZING, WE KNOW THAT. COME ON, COME ON. >> THERE ARE POLLY SICK LICKARY MATTIC CARBONS OUT THERE >> Stephen: NOW ARE YOU JUST MAKING STUFF UP. >> IT INDICATES IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR LIFE, IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A REMOTE THOUGHT THAT LIFE EXISTS OUT THERE, EVEN LIFE BASED ON THE KIND OF CHEMISTRY TO WHICH WE'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED, CARBON BASED LIFE. WE BETTER WATCH OUT. THE DAY COMES WHEN WE FIND LIFE THAT IS MORE INTELLIGENT THAT HE WE ARE. WE ARE GOING ON THE ASSUMPTION WE WILL FIND LIFE THAT CYNIC TELL GENT AND WILL BE JUST THE SAME INTELLIGENCE AS US >> Stephen: IF THEY COME. LET'S SAY THEY COME ON A SHIP.
