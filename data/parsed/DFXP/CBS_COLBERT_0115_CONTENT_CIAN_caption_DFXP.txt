WHAT YOU FOLKS AT HOME, DON'T SEE, DON'T KNOW, BEFORE EVERY TAPING, BEFORE I COME OUT HERE, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN PERFORM AN AMAZING MITLE MINICONCERT FOR THE LIVE CROWD WE HAVE HERE AT THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER.  ( APPLAUSE ) AMAZING. IT'S LIVELY. WHAT DO YOU GUYS CALL IT?
Jon: A LOVE RIOT.
Stephen: IT'S I LOVE RIOT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. AND SOMETIMES IT GETS SO RIOTOUS, THAT I'M AFRAID SOMEBODY'S GOING TO CALL THE LOVE POLICE TO SHUT IT DOWN, CALL IT THE LOVE CLUB. HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED? HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED.
Jon: THAT HASN'T HAPPENED BEFORE.
Stephen: NO THE POLICE HAVEN'T SHOWED UP TO THE LOVE RIOT?
Jon: THE POLICE HAVE SHOWED UP BUT NOT THE LOVE CLUB. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID, RIGHT?
Stephen: THE POLICE THEY GET-- TO THE POLICE GET SWEPT UP IN IT? THE COPS GET SWEPT UP IN THE LOVE RIOT?
Jon: SOMETIMES THEY DO. WE'VE HAD THE POLICE ACTUALLY JOIN US BEHIND IN CARS AND ON HORSEBACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: REALLY? THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
Jon: I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
Jon: THEY WERE TRYING TO STOP IT, BUT THEN THEY REALIZED THEY COULDN'T, SO THEY JUST JOINED.
Stephen: WOW. HOW DID THE HORSES FEEL ABOUT IT? DO YOU KNOW HOW THE HORSES FELT?
Jon: THEY WERE DANCING. ( APPLAUSE ) GIDDYAP! GIDDYAP! GIDDYAP!
Stephen: I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT. ANYWAY, HERE'S THE THING, JON AND THE BAND BEFORE THE SHOW, THEY REALLY GET EVERYBODY ON THEIR FEET SO THAT EVERYBODY IS READY TO SIT DOWN AND LISTEN TO ME FOR AN HOUR. THE TOPPER OF THESE PRE-SHOW PERFORMANCES IS PROVIDED BY DRUMMER AND RESIDENT JAZZ COWBOY, JOY SAYLOR. SAY HI TO JOE, EVERYBODY.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, MARSHAL, YOU HAVE A LITTLE TRADITION YOU DO AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE EVERY NIGHT. WHAT DO YOU DO?
WELL, I TEND TO GET A LITTLE BIT EXCITED, AND I SMASH MY TAMBOURINE.
Stephen: HE TAKES A TAMBOURINE AT THE END OF EVERY PERFORMANCE, BEFORE THE SHOW, AND HE DESTROYS THE TAMBOURINE, LIKE A TAMBOURINE PETE TOWNS ENDS. WE HAVE A REAL OF HIM SMASHING HIS TAMBOURINE. JIM? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: AND EVERYBODY LOVES IT. IT'S A REAL CROWD PLEASER. EVEN THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW WHO ABSORB THE SHRAPNEL COME BACK LATER TO GET THEIR EYE PATCHES SIGNED. AND I'M JUST SO HAPPY THE BAND AND WE CAN GIVE THE AUDIENCE SOMETHING SO FULL OF JOY EVERY NIGHT. AND-- ( CRYING ) I'M SORRY, IS SOMEBODY CRYING? SIR? SIR? WHAT'S WRONG?
THOSE POOR TAMBOURINES. ( LAUGHTER ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I GIFT YOU BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL TAMBOURINES, AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU DON'T ONLY BREAK-A THE TAM BREENS. YOU BREAK-A MY HEART.  CURSE ON YOU, STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: NO! NO! OH! I'M SO SORRY. I SWEAR, I THOUGHT THOSE TAMBOURINES WERE MASS PRODUCED BY KIDS IN MALAYSIA. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, I'M SORRY HE RIPPED UP HIS TICKET LIKE THAT. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE ANYONE IN MY AUDIENCE UPSET. WAIT. ( CRYING ) WAIT, IS SOMEBODY ELSE CRYING? SIR, WHY ARE YOU CRYING?
THAT POOR, POOR TICKET. ( APPLAUSE )
A CURSE ON YOU, STEPHEN COLBERT!
Stephen: OH, I'M SORRY. STEREOTYPICAL ITALIAN TICKET CRAFTSMAN. MAN, I AM SO SAD. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY CHEER ME UP?
Jon: YES, WE DO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NO, I WAS GOING TO SAY DOING THE SHOW, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A GREAT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, FOLKS.  ( APPLAUSE ) FIRST, FROM THE NEW MOVIE "MIDNIGHT SPECIAL," I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH ADAM DRIVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN I'LL BE TALKING TO THE STAR OF "CRAZY EX-GIRLFIREND," RACHEL BLOOM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY SAVAGES. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT'S THE SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, THE TAMBOURINE SAVAGES. AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK OFF THE SHOW WITH THEIR REMAINING INTRUMENTS. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: FORMER N.F.L. QUARTERBACK TIM TEBOW SAID HE'D BE OPEN TO RUNNING FOR POLITICAL OFFICE, ALTHOUGH, THE SUPREME COURT MIGHT BE A BETTER FIT FOR SOMEONE WITH THAT MUCH EXPERIENCE ON THE BENCH.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ADAM DRIVER. RACHEL BLOOM. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY SAVAGES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH. PLEASE, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. I ACTUALLY DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT THIS TAMBOURINE SITUATION BECAUSE YOU DO DESTROY A TAMBOURINE EVERY NIGHT. DO WE HAVE, LIKE, A DEAL WITH THE TAMBOURINE COMPANY?
YEAH.
Stephen: WE DO?
THEY PROVIDE THEM. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THE DEAL IS THEY'RE HAPPY TO KEEP SELLING THEM TO US AS LONG AS YOU KEEP DESTROYING ONE EVERY NIGHT?
YEAH, AND THEY LOVE IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD DEAL. NOW, RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF THE SHOW HERE, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOME STORIES ABOUT COMPUTERS PHONES AND TECH STUFF LIKE THAT. HERE'S THE THING. I THOUGHT WHEN I DECIDED TO DO THIS WE HAD A REGULAR TECH SEGMENT ON THE SHOW THAT HAD GRAPHICS AND EVERYTHING, CALLED "TECH TALK," OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THIS IS TRUE. WE DON'T. AND THE FIRST TIME WE DID ONE OF THESE SEGMENTS, BACK IN OCTOBER, I THOUGHT WE HAD ALL THOSE GRAPHICS THEN, TOO, AND WE DIDN'T, AND I FORGOT TO ASK ANYONE TO MAKE ANY. SO AT THE LAST MINUTE BACK THEN, WE JUST DECIDED TO CALL THE SEGMENT DIGITAL-DOO AND I PLAYED A DIGERIDOO. THAT HAD ELECTRONIC BUTTONS ON IT OR SOMETHING. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE "DIGERI" SOUNDS A LITTLE LIKE "DIGITAL," AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE A DIGERIDOO IN MY OFFICE, WHICH I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHY. SO, AGAIN, TODAY, BECAUSE I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT WHAT GRAPHICS WE HAD READY, THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S DIGITAL-DOO. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S AN INSTRUMENT OF ENORMOUS SUBTLETIY. NOW, I'M REALLY EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT THIS STORY I'M ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT, AND I'M SO EXCITED I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE WORDS TO EXPRESS MY EXCITEMENT. LUCKILY, IT'S 2016,  AND MOST WORDS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY EMOJIS. AND I USE EMOJIS SOMETIMES. USUALLY WHEN I COMMUNICATE WITH MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER. I GENERALLY DON'T USE EMOJIS AT OTHER TIMES. I ENJOY THEM, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL OF THEM. BUT TONIGHT I REALLY WANT TO USE THEM BECAUSE I'M FEELING VERY HAPPY FACE. PARTY POPPER. PARTY POPPER. DOLPHIN. ONE REASON I'M FEELING SO VERY DOLPHIN TONIGHT IS THAT THERE'S SOME BIG NEWS OUT OF THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM. YEAH, THAT UNICODE CONSORTIUM, WHICH I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU PEOPLE IS THE NONPROFIT RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING ANY NEW EMOJIS. AND YOU KNOW ANY NEW EMOJIS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD. THESE ARE THE SAME GUYS WHO CAME UP WITH FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOATS, PROBABLY FOR ALL THOSE SAILORS OUT THERE WHO ARE GETTING GREAT WIFI. AND THEY HAVE JUST APPROVED A REVOLUTIONARY NEW EMOJI WITH ONE RAISED EYEBROW, WHICH, NO LESS THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM, IS CALLING "THE COLBERT EMOJI." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IT IS AN UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE. THAT'S ME WHEN I HAVE JAUNDICE. NOW, THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM SAYS THE COLBERT EMOJI CONVEYS "SKEPTICISM, ACCOMPANIED BY THE CONCEPTS OF DISAPPROVAL AND MILD SURPRISE." OH, REALLY? I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT. I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT SURPRISE-- BRING THEM BACK. BRING THEM BACK. BRING THEM BACK. I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT SURPRISE-TO-EYEBROWS RATIO. This is MILD SURPRISE: ONE EYEBROW. FULL SURPRISE: TWO EYEBROWS. MILD, FULL, MILD, FULL. OTHER MILD FULL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND TO BRING THIS NEW EMOJI TO MARKET IS NO SMALL FEAT. THE INVENTOR OF THIS EMOJI HAD TO FILL OUT A 53-QUESTION FORM AND SUBMIT A 2,700-WORD PROPOSAL, WHICH WAS THEN DEBATED BY THE UNICODE TECHNICAL EMOJI SUBCOMMITTEE BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE OFFICIAL CANDIDATE FOR INCLUSION IN THE UNICODE STANDARD. OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A SIMPLER ANSWER STARING US IN THE TINY YELLOW FACE. JUST PRESENT YOUR EMOJI AND LET THE COMMITTEE VOTE THUMBS UP OR POOP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND HERE'S THE-- THAT'S STILL KIND OF POSITIVE. AND HERE'S THE THING. IT'S SUCH A BYZANTINE PROCESS, WE MIGHT NOT SEE MY EMOJI, OR ME-MOJI, UNTIL 2017, WHICH IS FINE. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. BUT IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE. I'M SURE WE WON'T NEED AN EMOJI THAT MEANS SKEPTICISM AND DISSAPOINTMENT DURING THIS ELECTION YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ANYWAY, IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. MY OWN EMOJI. YOU CAN'T BUY THIS KIND OF PUBLICITY. AND FOR ONCE, I DIDN'T. BUT, I'VE GOT TO SAY, THIS IS NOT THE ONLY EXPRESSION I CAN MAKE. I'M NOT SOME ONE-FACE PONY. THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM IS WELCOME TO CREATE AN EMOJI BASED ON THIS FACE, OR THIS FACE, WHICH I CALL TRYING TO BE POLITE BUT WORRIED THAT THE ELDERLY RELATIVE YOU'RE TALKING TO IS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING RACIST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, AUNT RITA, YOU ADMIRE ASIANS, BUT WHAT? HERE'S ONE I CALL "ELF EXPOSING HIMSELF IN THE PARK." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THIS WILL MAKE A GOOD EME-MOJI. THIS IS "GIVING UP YOUR SUBWAY SEAT FOR A PREGNANT LADY AND MAKING SURE EVERYONE SAW." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND FINALLY, THIS IS PRETENDING TO BE SURPRISED WATCHING "GAME OF THRONES" WITH YOUR SPOUSE WHEN YOU SECRETLY WATCHED IT ALONE LAST WEEK. "WHAAAAAT...? THEY KILLED WHO! NO WAY." AS SOON AS THESE NEW EMOJIS HIT THE MARKET, I'M SURE I WILL MAKE A TON OF MONEY. OH, WAIT, NO. YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR EMOJIS. WELL, I'VE GOT JUST THE EMOJI FOR THAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ADAM DRIVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF. THAT'S THE STUFF, BABY. WELCOME BACK. MY FIRST GUEST IS A VERY TALENTED ACTOR WHO HAS PLAYED THE BAD BOY IN BOTH "GIRLS" AND "STAR WARS." HIS NEW MOVIE IS "MIDNIGHT SPECIAL."
HOW CAN SOMEONE CAUSE A SATELLITE TO FALL OUT OF ORBIT?
I DON'T KNOW. ASK AN ENGINEER.
WELL, BROUGHT DOWN AN AIR FORCE SATELLITE LAST NIGHT. DSP-9712. IT WAS TASKED WITH DETECTING--
A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION.
YEAH.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME ADAM DRIVER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED AS YOU CAN TELL. PEOPLE STOOD ON THEIR FEET WHEN YOU CAME OUT HERE. ARE YOU USED TO THAT YET, PEOPLE SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU ALL THE TIME?
NO, NO.
Stephen: NO?
I HAVEN'T REALLY GONE OUTSIDE MUCH IN THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.
Stephen: NOT SINCE THE WHOLE "STAR WARS" THING?
NOT SO MUCH.
Stephen: DO YOU NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE COMING UP TO YOU AND GOING, "OH, MY GOD ARE YOU THE GUY WHO KILLED HAN SOLO." I WAS DOING A CHILD. ( LAUGHTER ).
THE KIDS, YEAH, ARE GREAT. I FEEL LIKE BEFORE PARENTS WERE LIKE, "STAY AWAY FROM MY KIDS." AND NOW THEY'RE LIKE, "GET UP THERE AND TAKE A PICTURE. YOU'LL APPRECIATE IT LATER." ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THAT PART OF IT IS GOOD. I LOVE THAT PART.
Stephen: YEAH?
YEAH. THE PARENTS ARE THE SCARY THING.
Stephen: ARE YOU-- DOES THIS SCARE YOU, "NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE CALLED YOU A MILLENNIAL SEX SYMBOL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ARE YOU-- DO YOU LIKE THAT? I MEAN THAT'S NICE.
NO, NO-- YEAH, THAT'S NICE, YEAH. NO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. YEAH, THAT'S --
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. JUST SIT THERE AND BE SEXY.
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT, PROBABLY PROBABLY.
Stephen: WOULD ANYONE DISAGREE WITH THAT.
Audience: NO!
Stephen: SEE? YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT IT. YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR SEXINESS. IT'S LIKE HITTING THE ICE ON THE ROAD, YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO IT. YOU HAVE TO TURN INTO IT. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU IS NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE SERVE IN THE MILITARY IN THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT 1% OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY SERVE IN THE MILITARY. AND I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF ACTORS WHO HAVE SERVED IN THE MILITARY. AND YOU WERE A--
OH, MAN.
Stephen: A MARINE. OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. WAS THIS GUY-- WAS THIS GUY PREPARED TO BE A MILLENNIAL SEX SYMBOL RIGHT THERE?
OF COURSE,.
Stephen: I KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY WILL HAVE, LIKE, A NICKNAME FOR EACH OTHER. DO YOU HAVE, LIKE, A NICKNAME WITH ALL YOUR OTHER BULDIES?
ACTUALLY, NO. THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY IN MY UNIT THAT HAD BIG EARS, SO HE WAS-- HE WAS EARS 1, AND I GUESS I WAS EARS 2.
Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AGAIN. YOU HAVE BIG, BEAUTIFUL EARS, BUT THERE WAS A GUY WHO OUT-RANKED YOU IN EARS?
YEAH.
Stephen: REALLY?
YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: WOW!
HIS LAST NAME WAS MARTINEZ.
Stephen: EARS MARTINEZ.
YEAH, HE WAS EARS 1 AND I WAS EARS 2, BUT HE KIND OF GOT THE MAJORITY OF IT. OF THE VERBAL PUNISHMENT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S A PUNISHMENT, THE EARS THING?
WELL, JUST THE VERB-- JUST THE GENERAL ABUSE AS PART OF THE WHOLE THING. IN A GOOD WAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND AFTER THE MARINES YOU WENT TO JUILLIARD.
YES.
Stephen: AND YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOME OF THE GUYS IN THE BAND.
I DO, JON --
MIKE AND EDDIE AND JOE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU GO FROM THE MARINES, YOU HAVE BAD INJURIES, YOU WENT FROM THE MARINES AFTER TWO YEARS AND YOU WENT TO JEWELLARD. DOES ANYTHING TRANSLATE FROM THE MARINES TO STUDYING ACTING?
ACTUALLY, YEAH, I THINK SO. FOR ME I FEEL IT'S A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE WORKING, YOU KNOW, AS A TEAM. YOU KNOW, EVERYONE HAS A ROLE. YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR ROLE. IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE INDIVIDUAL PERSON. SO IT'S NEVER LIKE YOU SHOW UP ON A MOVIE OR A PLAY AND TRY TO MAKE EVERYONE WORK AROUND YOU. YOU'RE JUSHOLE THING. IN A GOOD WAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: NOW, I UNDERSTAND AFTE
BECAUSE NOW, YOU'RE A STAR! EVERYBODY OUT OF MY WAY! IT'S ADAM DRIVER!
YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Stephen: THE NEW MOVIE IT'S NEW MOVIE, OF COURSE, PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM "STAR WARS" AND FROM "GIRLS." AND THE NEW MOVIE "MIDNIGHT SPECIAL" IS ANOTHER SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE WHERE YOU'RE PLAYING AN N.S.A. INVESTIGATOR TRYING TO FIND A CHILD WHO MAY HAVE ALIEN POWERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
SOMETHING, YEAH.
Stephen: A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE SAY THAT SCIENCE FICTION IS, LIKE, SOME PEOPLE DERIDE SCIENCE FICTION AS A GENRE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SERIOUS IDEAS, BUT I LOVE SCIENCE FICTION. I THINK IT DOES HAVE SERIOUS IDEAS BEHIND IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IDEA BEHIND THIS MOVIE IS? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE IDEA BEHIND THIS MOVIE IS?
I KNOW WHAT JEFF SAYS --
DIRECTOR?
YEAH, JEFF NICHOLS, WAS REALLY ABOUT HIM STRUGGLING WITH LETTING GO OF HIS SON. SO IT WAS A BIG METAPHOR FOR THAT.
Stephen: IS HIS SON OKAY?
YEAH, NO, NO. JUST THE --
OH, GROWING UP.  GROWING UP AN AND EVENTUALLY HE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE-- OR NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE, I GUESS.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW.
I THINK HE WANTED TO PAY AROUND TO ALL THE EXHIBITION AND LEAVE MORE AMBIGUITY, AND I FEEL IKE THA THAT'S NOT-- I FEEL LIKE MAYBE TYPICALLY AMERICAN AUDIENCES, TO GENERALIZE, WHEN IT'S "A" TO "B" TO "C," AND EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED. BUT I FEEL THERE'S STRENGTH IN KIND OF MORE INTEREST-- THINGS I'M MORE INTERESTED IN ARE MORE AMBIGUOUS, AND THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER TO ANYTHING.
Stephen: YOU'VE BECOME SOMETHING OF A-- WELL, YOU'RE A SCIENCE FICTION ICON NOW. NO, YOU ARE, YOU'RE KILO REN, AN ICONIC CHARACTER NOW. WERE YOU A SCIENCE FICTION FAN WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? DID YOU GROW UP ON SCIENCE FICTION?
I DID. I GREW UP BEING AROUND "STAR WARS" FOR SURE.
Stephen: OR NOT TO.
I NEVER IDENTIFIED MYSELF AS SCIENCE FICTION. I JUST LIKED ALL THOSE MOVIE S.
Stephen:  I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T DO MUCH OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA. FOR A MILL LEDGE SEX SILL BOMB, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE.
IT PETRIFIES ME.
Stephen: WHAT SCARES YOU ABOUT IT?
JUST EVERYONE KNOWING-- A PRESSURE TO LET EVERYONE KNOWING EVERYTHING.
Stephen: AS OPPOSED TO JUST F.B.I.
THE N.S.A.
Stephen: BUT YOU ACTUALLY-- I'M SURPRISED BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY BECAME A MEME THIS YEAR THROUGH ADAM DRIVER CAT. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ADAM DRIVER CAT?
OH, YEAH.
Stephen: THIS IS ADAM DRIVER CAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) A REAL HONOR.
RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YEAH. YOU ACTUALLY-- YOU ACTUALLY-- WHAT'S THAT? THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND YOU GOT THE CAT ADOPTED. THE CAT GOT ADOPTED FOR BEING FAMOUS.
I HEARD, I HEARD.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE A HERO.
THANKS.
Stephen: ADAM THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Stephen: THE NEW MOVIE, YOU'RE ALREADY SHOOTING THE MIEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE, RIGHT?
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
Stephen: HOW SECRET IS IT. DO THEY PUT A BAG OVER YOUR HEAD AND THROW YOU IN A ROOM AND SAY, "JUST FIGHT SOMEONE." DO YOU GET TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AHEAD OF TIME.
YES. THIS ONE MORE SO THAN THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS FIGURING OUT WHAT THE VOCABULARY WAS GOING TO BE AND THAT STUFF BUT A LOT OF THOSE THINGS ARE KIND OF SOLVED SO WE KNEW IN ADVANCE WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE.
Stephen: GOOD LUCK. WE CAN'T WAIT FOR IT.
THANKS.
Stephen: THANK SO MUCH, ADAM DRIVER. "MIDNIGHT SPECIAL" IS IN THEATERS NOW.
Stephen: "MIDNIGHT SPECIAL" ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY CRAZY EX GIRLFRIEND RACHEL BLOOM
Stephen: HELLO! HOLO. LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN. LOVELY TO HAVE YOU HERE.
I'M JUST SO THRILLED!
Stephen: WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE YOU. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DRESS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE NO IDEA THE DESIGNER BECAUSE I'M HORRIBLE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHOEVER IT IS, THEY DID A GREAT JOB.
Stephen: THEY DID. THEY ABSOLUTELY DID.
THEY REALLY CRAFTED IT.
Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE ON AN ABSOLUTE ROCKET RIDE. THIS MUST FEEL GREAT. "CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND." YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED YOUR FIRST SEASON. HOW MANY MORE EPISODES.
TWO.
Stephen: YOU ALREADY WON A GOLDEN GLOBE FOR YOUR PERFORMANCE AS RIBECCA. WHAT ARE YOU, 28 YEARS OLD?
I AM. ALMOST 29.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT LM 29. THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER. AND YOU CREATED THIS SHOW. AND THE SHOW IS ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED REBECCA WHO HAS A CHANCE AT A HIGH-POWERED LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK, BIG CITY OF DREAMS. BUT SHE DITCHES IT ALL TO.
MOVE TO WEST COVENA, CALIFORNIA, TO PURSUE HER SUMMER CAMP EX-BOYFRIEND. IT'S TOO RELATABLE.
Stephen: SO SHE DIDN'T-- HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE'S-- SHE IS CHASING HIM ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
HE HAS NO IDEA. SHE IS PUTTING ALL OF HER UNHAPPINESS IN HIS HANDS, AND HE REALLY, HE'S JUST A NICE GUY WHO HAS NO IDEA.
Stephen: IS THIS CONFESSIONAL IN ANY WAY?
YOU KNOW, I THINK--
Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN A STALKY KIND OF EX-GIRLFRIEND BEFORE?
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA. IT MAKES US ALL STALKER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BREAK INTO SOMEBODY'S APARTMENT. YOU CAN CHECK FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM, AND SNAPCHAT.
Stephen: THIS IS WHY RICHARD DREYFUSS WILL NOT GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA. YOU'RE THE SCARY PERSON HE WANTS TO GET AWAY FROM.
THAT IS TOTALLY FAIR.
Stephen: HAVE YOU HAD A RATIONAL OBSESSION ABOUT A BOY-- I KNOW YOU'RE MARRIED, HAPPILY, MARRIED AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT, TOO.
THANKS?
Stephen: BUT THE-- I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS HOSTILE ABOUT THAT.
YOU'RE LIKE CONGRATS ON THAT, TOO! CONGRATS.
Stephen: I WAS 29 BEFORE I WAS MARRIED. YOU'RE 28. YOU BEAT ME BY A YEAR.
SORRY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY SORT OF STALKY KIND OF PURSUIT?
YEAH, I THINK THAT-- I SAY THE SHOW IS 80% EMOTIONAL AUTOBIOGRAPHY. BECAUSE LUCKILY I WAS SO-- I WAS A LITTLE TOO SELF-AWARE TO GO TO THESE LENGTHS TO STALK SOMEONE, BUT THERE WERE TIMES-- I'VE HAD SERIOUS CRUSHES SINCE I WAS ABOUT, LIKE, SEVEN YEARS OLD, LIKE REALLY LOVE-STRUCK, PERPETUALLY. AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO I THOUGHT ABOUT 90% OF THE DAY JUST OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND THE WAY THAT IT TOOK ME EXPOAFER MADE ME A WORSE PERSON. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? IT SOUNDS SO SWEET WHEN YOU SAY IT WITH A SMILE. ( LAUGHTER ).
I SUNK INTO A DEPRESSION. HA-HA!
Stephen: THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS SHOW IS THAT YOU-- IS THAT YOU BREAK INTO SONG ALL THE TIME IN THIS SHOW.
IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: NOW, THESE ARE FANTASIES THAT THE CHARACTER IS EXPERIENCING.
YEAH. THEY'RE HER WAYS OF EXPRESSING HERSELF EMOTIONALLY BECAUSE SHE'S EMOTIONALLY STUNTED. AND THE LAST TIME SHE WAS TRULY HAPPY WAS AT THIS SUMMER CAMP WITH THIS GUY JOSH CHAN, WHERE SHE WAS A CHORUS MEMBER IN THE CAMP MUSICAL. SO SHE CONFLATES MUSICALS WITH BEING IN CHARGE OF HER OWN DESTINY.
Stephen: DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE IN MUSICALS? HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A SINGER?
I JUST BUSTED OUT OF THE WOMB JUST WANTING TO SING, YEAH. JUST LIKE, HEY! ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME. I LOVE HOW THE PEOPLE IN YOUR SHOW SING.
YEAH.
Stephen: FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUSICALS WORK. HOW DO THEY-- I DON'TED UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IS, LIKE, INTEGRATED INTO A STORY.
UM... ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HERE'S WHAT I MEAN. HERE'S WHAT I MEAN. LIKE IN OPERA EVERYONE IS ALWAYS SINGING SO SINGING IS LIKE TALKING. BUT IN MUSICALS THERE'S TALK, TALK, TALK, AND SUDDENLY THERE'S SINGING. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE REAL WORLD.
