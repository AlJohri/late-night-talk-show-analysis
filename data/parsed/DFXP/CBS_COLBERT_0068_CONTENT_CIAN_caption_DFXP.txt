I WAS JUST ENJOYING MY LATE CHRISTMAS BLOAT. IT SET IN LATER THAN USUAL, EITHER THAT OR MY SUITS WERE SEPTEMBER TO THE CLEANERS. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT LITTLE KNOWN FACT: WE STILL HAVE ONE. (LAUGHTER) AND TOMORROW NIGHT IS OBAMA'S LAST BIG EVENT, THE STATE OF OUR UNION. AND THIS YEAR, THE PRESIDENT'S -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HUGE STATE OF THE UNION FANS HERE! AND THIS YEAR'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH IS GOING TO BE WHAT HIS AIDES ARE CALLING "NON-TRADITIONAL." SO I ASSUME IT'S MAYBE BAREFOOT. ON THE BEACH, EVERYONE'S IN LINEN, ROLLED CUFFS, AND INSTEAD OF A STATE OF THE UNION CAKE, MAYBE CUPCAKES. AND CONGRESS IS EVEN WRITING ITS OWN VOWS. "WE PROMISE TO NOT DO ANYTHING YOU PROPOSE FOR EVER AND EVER." AND YESTERDAY, THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF SAID THIS IS GOING TO BE, QUOTE, "A BIG LL, OF COURSE, IT'S OPTIMISTICÑi BY THEY GUY WHO'S LEAéi (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH! HE'S IN A GREAT MOOD! I FEEL REALLY GREAT! "MY FELLOW AMERICANS, AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF GETTING ATTACKED ON ALL SIDES, THE STATE OF  OUR UNION IS FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT NEXT YEAR. THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO CURLING UP IN A HAMMOCK AND GETTING THROUGH A NOVEL WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO AUTHORIZE A DRONE STRIKE. AND THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH ITS FAMILY. THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS ALSO THINKING ABOUT GETTING A CONVERTIBLE! THE STATE OF OUR UNION HAS ALWAYS WANTED A CONVERTIBLE AND DAMN IT, I THINK THE STATE OF OUR UNION HAS EARNED IT.]' IN CONCLUSION, THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS... REALLY READY TO STOP BEING CALLED A SECRET MUSLIM HITLER. THAT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE."xD5aÑi%9 SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO, AND WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FIRST, I'LL BE TALKING TO THE VERY FUNNY JANE LYNCH. APPLAUSE)KolpquúçK%qññ&rÑiÑiÑwDr FANTASTIC, YEAH. IN HER NEW SHOW "ANGEL FROM HELL," SHE PLAYS A GUARDIAN ANGEL. AND I KNOW IT MAY SOUND SILLY, BUT I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE IN JANE LYNCH. (LAUGHTER) I'LL ALSO BE TALKING TO THE U.S. SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, JULIAN CASTRO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)çóÑijF I'LL ASK HIM IF I SHOULD BUILD HOUSES ON PARK PLACE, OR SAVE MY MONEY AND BUY A RAILROAD. (LAUGHTER) AND I'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE BY INDIE W "RETURN TO THE MOON." IT'S BASED ON THE TRUE STORY OF NEIL ARMSTRONG FORGETTING HIS KEYS. (LAUGHTER) (BAND PLAYING) THE REASON YOU ARE CURRENTLY DANCING IS THE MUSIC OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE ABOUT TO START THE SHOW, BUT BEFORE WE DO, ONE MORE THING: A WOMAN IN CALIFORNIA FOUND A BLOODY FINGERTIP IN HER APPLEBEE'S SALAD. THAT'S CRAZY! WHO GOES TO APPLEBEE'S AND ORDERS A SALAD?! (BAND PLAYING)Ñi
TONIGHT... STEPHEN WELCOMES JANE LYNCH!Ñi HUD SECRETARY JULIAN CASTRO! AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY EL VY! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! ♪ AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU, JON!
Jon: THANK YOU, STEPHEN! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN)
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH! ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE BIG NEWS OUT OF THE WAY: I DID NOT WIN THE POWERBALL THIS  WEEKEND. BUT YOU KNOW WHO REALLY LOST THE LOTTO? EL CHAPO. THE MAN WHO BUILT THE WORLD'S SECOND MOST LUCRATIVE DRUG EMPIRE. -- AFTER PFIZER. IF ONLY HEROIN GAVE YOU AN ERECTION INSTEAD OF JUST MAKING YOU NOT CARE. ON FRIDAY, JOAQUIN "EL CHAPO" GUZMAN, WAS FINALLY CAPTURED BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES, SIX MONTHS, AFTER TUNNELING OUT OF PRISON FOR THE SECOND TIME. IT'S GOOD THEY PUT HIM ON A HELICOPTER. ONCE IT'S AIRBORNE, IT MAKES THE TUNNELING A LITTLE MORE HAZARDOUS. HERE'S THE OFFICIAL ARREST PHOTO. IT'S A LOVELY CHOICE. (LAUGHTER) PUTTING HIM IN STRONG COMPETITION WITH KHALEED SHEIKH MOHAMMED FOR WORST ARREST FASHION CHOICE. AT LEAST EL CHAPO WAXED, IS WHAT I'LL SAY. (LAUGHTER) FOR MONTHS, THE UNPREDICTABLE EL CHAPO HAD BEEN ON THE RUN, HIDING IN THE JUNGLE. AND TO FIND HIM, IT TOOK ANOTHER UNPREDICTABLE MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN HIDING IN A JUNGLE: SEAN PENN. (LAUGHTER) NOW, SEAN PENN ACTS LIKE HE'S BEEN HIDING IN A JUNGLE MORE THAN EL CHAPO. EL CHAPO LOOKS LIKE HE'S BEEN HIDING IN A DISCO FOR SIX MONTHS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S NICE. OKAY. BECAUSE THE DAY AFTER EL CHAPO'S CAPTURE, ROLLING STONE PUBLISHED A SECRET INTERVIEW PENN HAD DONE WITH EL CHAPO MONTHS BEFORE THAT IS FILLED WITH HUMANIZING DETAILS ABOUT THE MISUNDERSTOOD DRUG LORD. AS PENN WRITES: "UNLIKE MANY OF HIS COUNTERPARTS WHO ENGAGE IN GRATUITOUS KIDNAPPING AND MURDER, EL CHAPO IS A BUSINESSMAN FIRST, AND ONLY RESORTS TO VIOLENCE WHEN HE DEEMS IT ADVANTAGEOUS TO HIMSELF OR HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS." SEE? SEE?! HE'S A PRETTY GOOD GUY. HE ONLY KILLS PEOPLE WHEN HE CAN MAKE MONEY OFF IT. TO SET UP THE MEETING, PENN EMPLOYED AN ELABORATE SERIES OF SECURITY MEASURES, INCLUDING: "TRACPHONES, OR BURNERS, ONE PER CONTACT, ONE PER DAY, LEVELS OF ENCRYPTION, MIRRORING THROUGH BLACKPHONES, ANONYMOUS E-MAIL ADDRESSES, AND UNSENT MESSAGES ACCESSED IN DRAFT FORM." WOW. THAT'S ELABORATE! WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, IF YOU WANTED TO CONTACT YOUR DEALER, YOU JUST PAGED THE GUY. (LAUGHTER) NOW IF, LIKE ME, YOU'RE THINKING YOU COULD NEVER PULL OFF THAT LEVEL OF SECRECY WITHOUT GETTING TRACKED. DON'T WORRY. SEAN PENN COULDN'T, EITHER.
A MEXICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL SAYS EL CHAPO'S SECRET INTERVIEW WITH ACTOR SEAN PENN FOR ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE HELPED AUTHORITIES LOCATE HIS WHEREABOUTS.
STEPHEN: YES, SOMEHOW AUTHORITIES WERE ABLE TO TRACK ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST CELEBRITIES. NOTE TO EDWARD SNOWDEN: CANCEL YOUR SIT-DOWN WITH NICHOLAS CAGE. (LAUGHTER) MM-HMM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME SEAN PENN FOR EL CHAPO'S CAPTURE, BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS ON EL CHAPO. AS PENN EXPLAINS, "GUZMAN AGREED TO A MEETING BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HIS LUCRATIVE LIFE OF DRUG-DEALING." YES, HIS OWN BIOPIC. PRESUMABLY STARRING DANNY DE VITO AND A LARGE BLACK CATERPILLAR. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) UH-HUH. UH-HUH. I BELIEVE THIS ARREST ONLY MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE EL CHAPO MOVIE WILL HAPPEN. ESPECIALLY ONCE HE ESCAPES TO DIRECT IT. SO I WANT IN. IN FACT, EL CHAPO, I'VE ALREADY PREPARED AN AUDITION TAPE FOR THE ROLE. ENJOY.
AHHH! I'M EL CHAPO. I RUN THIS MEXICO. NEVER TAKE ME LIVE, COPPERS. EL BANGO, EL BANGO!  YOU TELL THE D.E.A. CHAPO STOLE THE MILLENNIAL FACKEN, FOR GOOD THIS TIME. LET'S GO, CHUY! WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY DONKEY ATE THE DRUGS? I TOLD YOU TO GET A DROLL MULE! CARUMBA! EIGHT, NINE, TEN -- SUPPOSED TO BE 11 HEADS IN THE DUFFLE BAG! WHO TOOK TEX TRAY HEAD? DONKEY! THANK YOU. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT, I LIVE IN THE NEW YORK AREA, AVAILABLE ON WEEKENDS AND I CAN DRIVE STICK. I KNOW -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S A PRETTY -- I KNOW IT'S A PRETTY DARK SUBJECT MATTER, BUT THAT DOES MEAN WE'RE SHOW-IN TO WIN GOLDEN GLOBE FOR BEST COMEDY NEXT YEAR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE GREAT JANE LYNCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WOW! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD. SHE NOW STARS IN "ANGEL FROM HELL," RIGHT HERE ON CBS.
SO YOU HAVE BEEN PROTECTING ME MY WHOLE LIFE?
YEP, EXCEPT THE TIME YOU WERE KICKED BY THE COW, BECAUSE I ALSO WANTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU PULLED ITS TAIL.
IF YOU'RE AN ANGEL, DO YOU FLY?
WE ARE FLIGHTLESS WHICH TECHNICALLY MAKES US POULTRY.
DO YOU TALK TO GOD? TO PEOPLE AT APPLE TALK TO TIM COOK?
WHAT WOULD PEOPLE BE SURPRISED TO KNOW ABOUT ANGELS.
WE CAN CATCH ANYTHING THROWN TO US.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THROW ME SOMETHING. WHOA! NOT BAD.
MY JOB IS TO PROTECT YOU, AND IF I MISS SOMETHING, I'VE FAILED YOU.
IMPRESSIVE. SO YOU'RE LIKE AN UNPAID BODY GUARD.
WE DON'T JUST GUARD, WE TEACH LESSONS.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME, JANE LYNCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: LOVELY TO SEE YOU. LOVELY TO SEE YOU, STEPHEN.
Stephen: ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO IS TO STAND AT THE TOP OF A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AND HUG YOU WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP, BECAUSE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE GUY WHO OPENED THE ENVELOPE THE NIGHT YOU WON THE EMMY FOR "GLEE." THAT WAS SO EXCITING FOR ME TO BE THE GUY TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
IT WAS EXCITING FOR ME BECAUSE WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER A REALLY LONG TIME.
Stephen: BACK IN CHICAGO. ALTHOUGH IN DIFFERENT TOURING COMPANIES, WE WERE THERE AT THE SAME TIME. IT MEANT A LOT. IT WAS GREAT. I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU. YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.
Stephen: I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU. YOU'RE DOING SO WELL.
THANK YOU (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELL, LISTEN, THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY. IT WAS GREAT TO SEE YOU.
YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR MEMORIES OF "SECOND CITY"?
I REMEMBER THE SMELL OF STALE BEER AND BLEACH. FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
Stephen: DO YOU REMEMBER THE FLOOR AT SECOND CITY? BECAUSE SECOND CITY WAS A CABARET THEATER AND HAD BEEN THERE SINCE 1959, STILL IS THERE.
WAS IT CARPET ORG A STICKY FLOOR? > Stephen: IT WAS AS HARD ADD AS CONCRETE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CONCRETE BECAUSE I WAITED THERE FOR A LONG TIME.
YOU DID?
Stephen: I WAS A WAITER, BUS BOY, SOLD T-SHIRTS, WORKED IN THE BOX OFFICE.
YOU REALLY WORKED YOUR WAY UP.
Stephen: I CAME RIGHT YOU HAVE THE RAT LINES.
YEAH! (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: I THOUGHT IT WAS CONCRETE UNTIL I DROPPED SOMETHING ON IT AND THERE WAS A LITTLE KNAPP ON THE WALL, BUT IT WAS CARPET.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE GERMS AND BODILY FLUIDS FROM 1959?
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT THE BLEACH WAS FOR.
YES, THEY JUST POUR BLEACH OVER EVERYTHING.
Stephen: YOU AND I NOW BOTH WORK FOR THE GREAT CBS CORPORATION.
WE DO.
Stephen: ONE OF THE NICE THINGS, THOUGH WE WORK FOR CBS, WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE --
THAT WE WORK FOR THEM. WHICH IS THE NICEST THING.
Stephen: DO YOU PARTICULARLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOW?
NO, I DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOW AT ALL.
Stephen: WE PROBABLY SHOULD. WHEN IS IT ON?
9:30 THURSDAYS. AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH, LIKE THE THIRST OF -- OKAY. GOOD. ALL RIGHT. I LOVE THIS SHOW. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
GOOD. I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.
Stephen: I LOVE THE IDEA OF A GUARDIAN ANGEL.
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE ONE?
Stephen: WITHOUT A DOUBT. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GUARDIAN ANGELS?
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE, BUT THERE ARE TIMES YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING AND SOMETHING BEYOND YOUR LOGICAL MIND WILL STOP YOU OR GET YOU TO TURN RIGHT HERE -- YEAH, I THINK WE'RE GUIDED.
Stephen: I THINK I MIGHT TRY SOME DELICIOUS METH!
WAIT! HOLD ON!
Stephen: I MIGHT BE ALLERGIC.
THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: WHAT DOES YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL LOOK LIKE?
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A PERSON OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT I WILL FIND MYSELF, YOU KNOW, ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING AND MAYBE YOU DON'T DO IT, OR, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST -- ACTUALLY, IF WE CAN GET A LITTLE DEEP RIGHT NOW --
Stephen: SURE, THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE.
I WAS NEWLY SOBER MANY YEARS AGO, AND I WAS VERY SAD, AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I FELT ARMS GO AROUND ME. YEAH.
Stephen: SO, I -- AND YOU WERE ALONE AT THIS POINT?
YES, STEPHEN, I WAS SO ALONE, AND THAT WAS PART OF THE PAIN.
Stephen: OH, WOW, THAT'S A VERY SWEET STORY.
YEAH.
Stephen: MINE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE -- IT'S LIKE A KID ABOUT THIS TALL AND FLOATS BEHIND ME ABOUT THREE FEET UP AND THREE FEET BACK ALL THE TIME.
YEAH, I SEE HIM.
Stephen: GOLDEN LIGHT. YEAH, THE GOLDEN LIGHT.
Stephen: I'M SEMISERIOUS, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS I KNOW AREN'T TRUE BUT I BELIEVE THEM ANYWAY. IT'S CRAZY FOR ME TO BELIEVE IN THE GUARDIAN ANGEL BUT I TOTALLY BELIEVE OURS IS UP THERE.
I DO, TOO. THAT'S WHAT AMY IS FOR ALLISON.
Stephen: ALLISON IS THE YOUNG LADY.
PLAYED BY MAGGIE LAWSON.
Stephen: RIGHT. YOU MIGHT SAY WHY WOULD AN EDUCATED, BRILLIANT DERMATOLOGIST, SOMEBODY DOING WELL IN LIFE, NEED A GUARDIAN ANGEL? INDEED, SHE DOES. I THINK WE ALL DO.
Stephen: YOUR ANGEL IS THE ANGEL FROM HELL IN THAT SHE'S NOT THE USUAL ANGEL.
SHE'S NOT MICHAEL LANDON OR ROAMA DOWNEY.
Stephen: SHE'S TO TEACH YOU LESSONS BY MAKING THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU.
SHE'S A BIT OF A DRUNK, CREME DE MENTHE, A FAN OF THE LIQUEURS.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK THERE IS DRINK IN HEAVEN? A GLASS OF WINE IN HEAVEN?
I DON'T KNOW. BUT AT LEAST FOR AMY, SHE LOVES BEING IN HUMAN FORM, AND SHE LOVES EVERYTHING THAT IS CARNAL AND PRIMITIVE AND DIRTY AND SEXY AND SUGARY, SHE LOVES THE WHOLE HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND SHE WANTS ALLISON TO ENJOY THE WHOLE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.
Stephen: BUT ISN'T THAT THE MESSAGE OF THE DEVIL?
INDEED!
Stephen: ARE YOU THE DEVIL? I AM THE DEVIL FROM HEAVEN. THAT'S A PLAY ON --
Stephen: DID THAT JUST BLOW YOUR MIND?
IT DID. WE JUST CAME UP WITH IT. WE DIDN'T PREP THIS.
Stephen: WHAT WORRIES ME IS THERE IS NO DIET COKE IN HEAVEN.
ARE YOU ADDICTED TO DIET COKE?
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
Stephen: METH DIET COKE. DO YOU FIND IT REFRESHING? SOMETIMES I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN A DIET COKE. NOT WATER --
Stephen: I WANT TO POINT OUT, THERE IS IN NO WAY SPONSORED BY DIET COKE.
BUT WE WILL EXPECT A COUPLE OF CASES WHEN WE GET HOME.
Stephen: I BETTER. YOU'RE SUCH A BUSY PERSON, NOT ONLY DO YOU DO THE SHOW, "ANGEL FROM HELL," BUT YOU'RE ALSO A --
GAME SHOW HOSTESS.
Stephen: HOLLYWOOD GAME NIGHT?
YES, TUESDAY NIGHTS ON NBC.
Stephen: RIGHT. (APPLAUSE)
IT'S A TOTAL BLAST. IT'S JUST FUN. IT'S LIKE THROWING A PARTY. I LOVE THROWING PARTIES. I DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE GOING TO PARTIES.
Stephen: YOU'RE WELL KNOWN OUT IN HOLLYWOOD, EVERYBODY LOVES JANE LYNCH. DO YOU GO OUT AT NIGHT AND DO THE PARTY THING?
I'M IN BED BY 6:40 P.M.
Stephen: COME ON... LIKE A 90-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH THE EARLY BIRD SPECIAL.
I GO TO A NICE RESTAURANT FOR DINNER AND I'M THERE RIGHT AS THEY'RE OPENING THE DOORS FOR DINNER.
Stephen: 6:40? YEAH, I JUST LOVE GETTING INTO BED ALONE WITH MY TWO DOGS AND --
Stephen: NEVER ALONE, YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL IS WITH YOU.
HOLDING ME TENDERLY.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU GO TO SLEEP THAT EARLY?
I USUALLY DON'T FALL ASLEEP TILL 8:00 AND MAK WAKE UP AT 4:00 WITH NOTHING TO DO.
Stephen: WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET YOU OUT OF HERE BEFORE YOU NOD OFF. THIS IS REALLY LATE FOR YOU NOW.
IT REALLY IS, YES.
Stephen: JANE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
IT IS SUCH A THRILL TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: ALSO, YOU'RE DOING A TOURING SHOW.
YES, SEE JANE SING, A CABARET SHOW. IN JUNE, WE'LL BE ALL OVER THIS FINE COUNTRY, BUT I HAVE A SMATTERING OF DATES. KATE FLANNERY, A SECOND CITY PERSON, AND SHE WAS MEREDITH THE DRUNK IN THE OFFERS, AND WE DO CRAZY STUFF WITH A FIVE-PIECE BAND AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
Stephen: I WILL CHECK IT OUT.
PLEASE DO.
Stephen: CAN I GET A LITTLE KISS?
OF COURSE!
Stephen: "ANGEL FROM HELL" 930TIME THURSDAYS, CBS! JANE LYNCH, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, TO OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN MEXICO LAST WEEK. HAS EL CHAPO ESCAPED YET? NO? ALL RIGHT, JUST CHECKING. WHAT ABOUT SEAN PENN? IS HE STILL AT LARGE? EITHER WAY, EL CHAPO IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. BECAUSE NO LESS AN AUTHORITY THAN ANTONIO VASQUEZ, MEXICANÑi GRAND WARLOCK, AND YES THEY HAVE THOSE, I THINK IT'S A CABINETñr POSITION -- PREDICTED AT HIS ANNUAL PRESS CONFERENCE/TAROT CARD READING THAT "AUTHORITIES WILL DECIDE TO KILL EL CHAPO INSTEAD OF ARRESTING HIM. ALTHOUGH IN THE GRAND WARLOCK'S DEFENSE, HE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE "NEXT" TIME EL CHAPO ESCAPES. IS HE GONE YET? LEMME KNOW. BUT THAT WASN'T THE HEADLINE COMING OUT OF HIS TAROT PRESS CONFERENCE. NO! "EL WARLOCK MAS GRANDE" HAD A -- THAT MEANS IT COMES WITH CREAM CHEESE. (LAUGHTER) "EL WARLOCK MAS GRANDE" HAD A STARTLING PREDICTION ABOUT THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND NOTABLY, A MEXICAN GRAND WARLOCK IS STILL NOT THE WEIRDEST THING ABOUT THIS ELECTION. AND I PAID ATTENTION, BECAUSE THIS GRAND WARLOCK "WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE 2012 MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND MEXICO'S TRIUMPH OVER CAMEROON IN THE 2014 WORLD CUP," AND HE PREDICTED HUGO CHAVEZ'S DEATH! YES, THE GRAND WARLOCK CORRECTLY PREDICTED HUGO CHAVEZ'S DEATH -- ARMED WITH ONLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT CHAVEZ HAD CANCER AND A SEVERE RESPIRATORY INFECTION. AND THIS YEAR, THE GRAND WARLOCK LOOKED AT HIS TAROT CARDS AND PREDICTED:  "TWO TRIANGLES OF SPADES! TRUMP WON'T REALLY BECOME THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. THE MAN HAS COUNTLESS PROBLEMS. AND SEE, HERE IS THE DEVIL HIMSELF!" THAT'S RIGHT! THAT IS RIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT, MEXICO'S GRAND WARLOCK SAYS DONALD TRUMP WON'T BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. AND THIS TAROT CARD READING MUST BE TRUE. WHY ELSE WOULD A MEXICAN HAVE SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? AND THERE'S MORE! "AND THERE'S MORE! I'M CERTAIN THAT IN DECEMBER, TRUMP WILL FALL INTO A NERVOUS CRISIS AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE SENT TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... IF THE WARLOCK IS RIGHT, TRUMP WILL SOON BE SURROUNDED BY MENTALLY DISTURBED PEOPLE. AND THIS TIME NOT BECAUSE HE'S HOSTING "CELEBRITY APPRENTICE." NOW CALL ME CRAZY, BUT AS GOOD AS HE IS, I DON'T BELIEVE  A MEXICAN GRAND WARLOCK SHOULD BE WEIGHING IN ON OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. WE NEED AN "AMERICAN" GRAND WARLOCK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (AUDIENCE CHANTING)
Stephen: YES! (DOORBELL RINGING) (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: MY APOLOGIES. TOOK A WARLOCK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIS SPIRIT ANIMAL. (DOORBELL RINGING) (DOORBELL RINGING) (LAUGHTER) YES, I AM THE AMERICAN GRAND WARLOCK.

THE DEVIL'S MOTHER WILL PUT THIS ON HER REFRIGERATOR AND SHE'LL NEVER HAVE THE HEART TO THROW IT AWAYYYYY! AND  WHEN SHE DIES, THE DEVIL WILL FIND IT AND SAY "LOOK WHAT SHE KEPT. SHE REALLY DID LOVE ME." (LAUGHTER) SO LET ME CONSULT MY TAROT CARDS -- A LITTLE TAROT MUSIC, PLEASE, ANYONE. ♪ LET'S SEE WHAT THE SPIRIT WORLD PREDICTS FOR THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. THE SIX OF WANDS! AFTER FAILING TO GET THE NOMINATION, GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE WILL LEAVE POLITICS AND WORK IN A BOWLING ALLEY WHERE HE CAN CLOSE LANES WHENEVER HE WANTS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OHHHH! SPIRIT WORLD IS ANGRY AT MY BEARD STRAP. (LAUGHTER) YES, YES, I SEE ANOTHER CARD. OH, OH! THE CARD OF BLOCKBUSTING! SOMEONE CRACK A WINDOW. (LAUGHTER) DURING THE RAPTURE, MIKE HUCKABEE WILL RAISE HIS ARMS TO THE HEAVENS, SCREAMING, "GOD, TAKE ME NOW!" THERE WILL THEN BE A LONG AWKWARD SILENCE DURING WHICH GOD WILL PRETEND TO LOOK AT HIS CELLPHONE. (LAUGHTER) OH, OH! THE DREADED $15 ITUNES GIFT CARD! ALWAYS A BAD OMEN. IT MEANS THE SPIRIT WORLD PUT NO THOUGHT INTO YOUR GIFT. THIS TELLS ME THAT A CYBORG H.P. THREE-IN-ONE PRINTER FAX MACHINE WILL BE SENT BACK FROM THE FUTURE TO TRY TO TERMINATE CARLY FIORINA. AHH.
Stephen: NO! BALTIC AVENUE! (LAUGHTER) I SEE, THROUGH THE MIST -- I HOPE IT'S MIST -- (LAUGHTER) IN A BID TO GET MORE RATINGS, C.N.N. WILL HOST A DEBATE FEATURING SEVEN SHRIEKING MONKEYS WEARING DONALD TRUMP MASKS. (LAUGHTER) OH, YES, WHAT ARE THE SPIRITS TELLING ME NOW... OHHH, A "HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS" TRADING CARD! I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THESE ACTUALLY EXIST, HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS TRADING CARDS! (APPLAUSE) THEY HAVE THE STORY OF HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS ON THE BACK. WHEN THIS FILM WAS RELEASED, EVIDENTLY THEY WERE SO SURE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO WANT THESE -- THEY'RE NOT COLLECTIBLES, THEY'RE TRADING CARDS. THEY ASSUMED THERE WOULD BE A BARTER SYSTEM, AN ECONOMY BASED ON THE CHARACTER OF HARRY HENDERSON. OH! IN ORDER TO APPEAL TO VOTERS IN HIS HOME STATE OF FLORIDA, A SHIRTLESS MARCO RUBIO WILL SMOKE BATH SALTS AND HAVE A CHAIN FIGHT IN A WAFFLE HOUSE. WHAT'S THIS... OOH, MY CBS I.D. BADGE!

Stephen: HE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT YOU.

Stephen: I JUST SAW THE BIG SHORT. I JUST SAW THE BIGÑi SHORT. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE HOUSES THAT WERE FORECLOSED% IS HUD INVOLVED AT ALL WITH THOSE HOUSES THAT WERE FORECLOSED ON?
WE WERE INVOLVED IN TRYING TO GET HOMEOWNERS SO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. IN FACT, ONE OF THE SUCCESS STORIES OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THROUGH HUD'S WORK, THROUGH THE TREASURE'S WORK, WE WERE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT MORE THAN A MILLION FOLKS KEPT THEIR HOME EITHER THROUGH MODIFICATIONS, REFINANCING. WE INVESTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION PROGRAM, N.S.P., THAT HELPED REVITALIZE NEIGHBORHOODS, SO THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE, WHETHER IN FLORIDA, NEVADA, OR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THAT ARE IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY GOT.
Stephen: NOW, YOU ARE NOT RUNNING FOR ANYTHING RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?
I AM NOT.
Stephen: YOU SOUND A LITTLE BIT LIKE YOU'RE RUNNING FOR SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.
IT'S HARD TO GET IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.
Stephen: YOU'RE A VERY GOOD POLITICIAN, SO IS YOUR BROTHER JOAQUIN. YOU ARE TWINS. DO YOU EVER PRETEND TO BE EACH OTHER? DOES HE EVER SHOW UP TO THE CABINET MEETINGS SO YOU CAN HAVE A DAYOFF, THIS DAY OFF YOU CABINET PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE TIME?
I DON'T THINK I COULD STAND FIVE MINUTES IN CONGRESS. HE SAYS AIM MINUTE UGLIER THAN HE IS.
Stephen: HE'S THE YOUNGER BROTHER?
HE IS. WE CANNOT IMPERSONATE EACH OTHER BECAUSE HE SAID EVERYBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL BECAUSE I'M SO MUCH UGLIER THAN HE IS.
Stephen: THAT'S SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE BROTHER.
YES.
Stephen: SOMEONE WHO FINDS YOU ATTRACTIVE ON A CERTAIN LEVEL IS HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE SHE HAS FLOATED YOUR NAME WHEN ASKED IF SHE GOT THE NOMINATION WHO WOULD SHE CONSIDER AS PRESIDENT, SHE SAID, WELL, CERTAINLY JULIAN CASTRO WOULD BE SOMEONE WE WOULD CONSIDER, AND THERE ARE RUMORS YOU'RE IN VICE PRESIDENT TRAINING CAMP. WHAT DOES THAT INVOLVE OTHER THAN STAYING AWAKE BEHIND SOMEONE GIVING STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS? (LAUGHTER) TELL ME THIS -- HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT -- YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED OR IS THERE ANY LIKELIHOOD OR NEW TRUTH TO THE RUMORS THAT SHE WOULD APPROACH YOU ON A SCALE OF ONE TO STEPHEN THAT'S FLATTERING TO EVEN BE MENTIONED BUT I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE JOB I'M DOING RIGHT NOW?
STEPHEN, IT'S FLATTERING TO EVEN BE MENTIONED, BUT I'VE GOT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE JOB THAT I'M DOING.
Stephen: SO SHE ASKED. SHE'S ALREADY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IT. (APPLAUSE)
NO, NOT AT ALL. NOT AT ALL.
Stephen: NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND YOU ARE OF HISPANIC ORIGIN BUT YOU'RE SECOND GENERATION. YOU DIDN'T GROW UP SPEAKING SPANISH.
I DID NOT. I GREW UP POSTALLY WITH MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER. MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD SPEAK SPANISH AROUND THE THE HOME BUT I NEVER BECAME FLUENT.
Stephen: ARE YOU TAKING LESSONS BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO, SAY, RUN FOR A NATIONAL OFFICE, IT MIGHT BE NICE TO SPEAK A LITTLE SPANISH ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. DO YOU WANT TO DO A LITTLE FLASH CARD WORK?
WHY NOT? THE LIBRARY.
