NOT ONLY-- NOT ONLY-- I GOTTA SAY, NOT ONLY IS IT PLEASANT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE CHANTED, BUT THAT TOOK SO LONG, I WAS ABLE TO CATCH MY BREATH AFTER THAT KICKING. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR STEPHEN COLBERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S TUESDAY, OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT, WEDNESDAY EVE. DON'T FORGET TO LEAVE SOME MILK AND COOKIES OUT FOR FATHER HUMPDAY! HE LIKES TO STRESS-EAT. THAT'S WHAT GAVE HIM THE HUMP. HEY, DID YOU GUYS WATCH THE NEW "DAILY SHOW" LAST NIGHT? THE NEW "DAILY SHOW"? DID ANYBODY SEE THAT? I DID, AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT WAS GREAT. JON STEWART IS LOOKING TAN AND RESTED. I DO NOT KNOW-- DID YOU SEE IT? >> Jon: YEAH. >> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT ON HIS VACATION, BUT HE CAME BACK WITH A KIND OF ADORABLE ACCENT. GLAD YOU SHAVED THE BEARD, JON. LOOKING FORWARD TO TREVOR NOAH, I'VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT THAT NIGH. FROM THE NEW MOVIE "FREEHELD", MY GUEST IS THE GREAT ELLEN PAGE. TINY, PACKED WITH TALENT, PACKED! I LOVED HER IN "X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST." AND TONIGHT, I'LL BE TALKING TO HER ON YESTERDAY'S TOMORROW. THEN I'LL BE TALKING WITH THE TALENTED JESSE EISENBERG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) VERY HIP. VERY HIP COLLECTION OF ACTORS TONIGHT. VERY YOUNG. HE'S WRITTEN A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES, AND IN THE UPCOMING "BATMAN VERSUS SUPERMAN," HE PLAYS A BILLIONAIRE WHO HATES ALIENS. I ASSUME HE BUILDS A WALL AROUND METROPOLIS AND MAKES KRYPTON PAY FOR IT. THEN I'LL TALK TO ARTIST AND INVENTOR DOMINIC WILCOX. HIS INVENTIONS, LIKE G.P.S. SHOES AND A STAINED-GLASS CAR, ARE COLLECTED IN HIS BOOK "VARIATIONS ON NORMAL." IT'S THE PERFECT BOOK FOR YOUR COFFEE TABLE THAT IS ALSO A LAWNMOWER. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, FOLKS, MY FUNK-SENSE IS TINGLING. THAT MUST BE THE SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HEY, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, BEFORE THESE FELLAS RELEASE THE JAZZ KRAKEN, ONE LAST THING: VOLKSWAGEN HAS ANNOUNCED IT WILL BE RETROFITTING THE 11 MILLION VEHICLES THAT CHEATED ON EMISSIONS TESTS. NOW, TO BE MORE HONEST, THEIR CARS WILL JUST RUN ON BURNING GLACIER. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ELLEN PAGE. JESSE EISENBERG. AND INVENTOR DOMINIC WILCOX. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. HOW YOU DOING, JON? YOU DOING OKAY OVER THERE? >> Jon: YEAH, WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE OVER HERE STAYING HUMAN. >> Stephen: GOOD, GOOD. YOU'RE FROM NEW ORLEANS, I GUESS I SHOULD SAY HOW YOU ALL ARE. THAT'S HOW YOU TALK DOWN THERE NCH WE DON'T TALK LIKE THAT. >> Stephen: THAT'S ON THE CAGE UNCOMMERCIALS. THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL TALK LIKE. >> Stephen: MAYBE I CHANGED SINCE I MOVED TO NEW YORK. >> Stephen: YOU CHANGED? >> Jon: YEAH, MORE FAST PACED, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: THIS IS YOUR FAST PACE? THIS IS YOUR FAST PACE? >> Jon: YEAH, YOU KNOW -- >> CALM DOWN, SLOW DOWN. I GOTTA SAY, I'M GLAD YOU GUYSES HAVE GOT EVERYTHING, BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE DRAINED. SEE, POPE FRANCIS LEFT JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, AND I AM STILL COMING DOWN FROM IT. I NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM, BUT I INHALED A LOT OF SECOND-HAND INCENSE, I GOT A CONTACT-BLESSING. BUT NOW THE POPE HAS RETURNED TO ROME, AND I GOTTA SAY, I MISS HIM. YOU KNOW, AT LEAST, I'LL ALWAYS HAVE THESE SOUVENIRS. I HAVE THESE POPE FRANCIS BUTTONS. I HAVE THE POPE FRANCIS BOOKMARK EYE DON'T KNOW HOW I'M SUPPOSED TO GET THAT INTO MY KINDLE. AND I GOT THIS, THIS IS THE REAL THING. I GOT MY POPE FRANCIS PLUSH TOY. ( APPLAUSE ) PERSONALLY, I THINK THIS IS KIND OF SACRELIGIOUS. BUT THE DOG LOVES IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, THESE ARE ALL BETTER SOUVENIRS OF THE POPE THAN WHAT THIS GUY GOT. >> PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN BOB BRADY DECIDED HE WANTED A UNIQUE MEMENTO OF THE PAPAL VISIT. AFTER THE POPE FINISHED HIS SPEECH TO CONGRESS, BRADY HELPED HIMSELF TO THAT VERY GLASS OF WATER THAT THE PONTIFF HAD BEEN SIPPING FROM AS HE MADE HIS ADDRESS. >> Stephen: DUDE, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? ART THOU SERIOUS? YOU STOLE THE POPE'S USED DRINKING GLASS? CONGRESSMAN BRADY, HERE'S THE THING-- IT WON'T GIVE YOU SUPERPOWERS. IT'S NOT LIKE GETTING BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE POPE. THAT'S THIS GUY. ( APPLAUSE ) MAYBE, I DON'T-- MAYBE I SHOULDN'T JUDGE HIM FOR BREAKING THE SEVENTH AND TENTH COMMANDMENTS LITERALLY BEHIND THE POPE'S BACK. I'M SURE HE HAD A GOOD REASON FOR THIS "MISA-POPERIATION." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JIM? >> BRADY, WHO HAS SAID HE BELIEVES THE WATER IN THE GLASS IS HOLY, SHARED SOME WITH HIS FAMILY AND STAFFERS IN HIS OFFICE. HE INTENDS TO SPRINKLE THE REST ON HIS GRANDCHILDREN. >> Stephen: YES, HE'S GONNA SPRINKLE HIS GRANDKIDS WITH PAPAL BACKWASH. I'M SURE THEY'LL RECEIVE A BLESSING, OR AT LEAST CONJUNCTIVITIS. NOW, LIKE ME, YOU MIGHT BE SAYING, "HEY, JUST BECAUSE THE POPE TOUCHED A GLASS DOESN'T MAKE IT HOLY WATER." BUT WE AREN'T BOB BRADY, BECAUSE THE CONGRESSMAN SAID, "I'M CONSIDERING IT AS HOLY WATER. I'M NOT CHECKING WITH ANYBODY. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW." DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW. BRADY IS USING THOMAS AQUINAS' THEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT OF LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA. AND TO MAKE SURE HE'S NOT DOUSING HIS GRANDKIDS WITH JUST ANY STOLEN OLD-MANSPITTLE, CONGRESSMAN BRADY IS GIVING THE GLASS "TO PHILADELPHIA POLICE TO DUST IT FOR FINGERPRINTS TO PROVE ITS AUTHENTICITY." BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THE COPS IN PHILLY HAVE THE POPE'S PRINT ON FILE. AFTER ALL, HE'S PRETTY EASY TO PICK OUT OF A LINEUP. NUMBER TWO, PLEASE STEP FORWARD AND CELEBRATE THE LATIN MASS. AND IT TURNS OUT THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME REPRESENTATIVE BRADY HAS COPPED A CUP. "HE'S DONE IT BEFORE, WHEN HE SWIPED PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S GLASS AFTER HIS INAUGURATION IN 2009." OKAY, THIS IS BORDERING ON A FETISH NOW. BY THE WAY, DO NOT GOOGLE, "ONE CONGRESSMAN, TWO CUPS." AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, DO NOT SPRINKLE THAT ON ANYONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN THE MARKET CONGRESSMAN, YOU MISSED A FEW CHOICE POPE-RELATED ITEMS. FOR INSTANCE, COULD I INTEREST YOU IN THIS TOILET SEAT FROM MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, WHICH THE POPE NEVER TOUCHED, BUT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY TOUCHED BY THE BUTT OF SOMEONE WHO SAW THE POPE. JUST HAVE YOUR FRIENDS IN THE PHILLY POLICE FORCE DUST IT FOR ASS PRINTS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'M SURE WE ALL SAW THE BEAUTIFUL MOMENT WHEN THE POPE STOPPED HIS MOTORCADE TO KISS AND BLESS A BABY DRESSED UP AS THE POPE. AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO SAY SOMEBODY BETTER PUT THAT BABY UNDER LOCK AND KEY, 'CAUSE THIS GUY IS A SICK TWIST. STICK AROUND FOR ELLEN PAGE AND JESSE EISENBERG. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, IN ALL THE HOLY-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I JUST-- I JUST--  ( CHEERS ) I JUST ATTACKED MYSELF. I JUST ATTACKED MYSELF AND KNOCKED MY OWN GLASSES OFF. I-- I THINK I'M BULLYING MYSELF RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, FOLKS-- THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR MAKING JOKES ABOUT THE POPE, I THINK. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, IN ALL THE HUBBUB ABOUT THE POPE BEING IN TOWN LAST WEEK, YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE FACT THIS WEEKEND WE HAD A VISIT FROM ANOTHER INFALLIBLE PEOPLE OF A BILLION PEOPLE. CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING. HE'S THE POPE OF TOXIC DRY WALL. ON FRIDAY, DESPITE OUR TRADE WARS, TENSION IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND CHINESE HACKING ATTACKS, PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE PRESIDENT XI A FULL SOUTH LAWN WELCOME WHERE THE CHINESE PRESIDENT GREETED EVERY WHITE HOUSE STAFFER BY NAME AND BANK ACCOUNT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT WAS A LANDMARK SUMMIT BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS, WITH THE U.S. AND CHINA AGREEING THAT NEITHER COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT WILL CONDUCT CYBER-ENABLED THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THAT IS A HUGE STEP, BUT I WILL MISS THOSE CHINESE BOOTLEGS OF AMERICAN MOVIES. I REALLY ENJOYED THEIR VERSION OF MAD MAX, "CLEAR DAY, LITTLE TRAFFIC." ( LAUGHTER ) THEIR MARVEL SUPERHERO FILM: "INAUSPICIOUS NUMBER OF FANTASTICS," AND FOR THE KIDS, "HAPPY DILIGENT SUPPOSITORIES." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT PRESIDENT XI SAVED HIS BEST ANNOUNCEMENT FOR LAST. >> THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA ANNOUNCED A SWEEPING AGREEMENT TODAY AIMED AT LIMITING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. >> Stephen: YES, CHINA IS LIMITING THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, BRINGING THEM DOWN FROM THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF "INFINITE." OF COURSE, STEP ONE IN LOWERING EMISSIONS IS TRADING IN THEIR VOLKSWAGENS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW FULL DISCLOSURE: I BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING, AND I HAVE A BEACH HOUSE. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, PRESIDENT XI. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS EMBARRASSING FOR ME AS AN AMERICAN BECAUSE EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE BUSH 1 HAS GIVEN LIP-SERVICE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. AND IN THOSE DECADES OF INACTION, THINGS HAVE ONLY GROWN WORSE WITH ARCTIC THAWING, SUPER-STORMS, AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE LEVEL OF HULKAMANIA. YET, NOW, CHINA, THE WORLD LEADER IN LEAD TOOTHPASTE, IS TRYING TO SAVE THE PLANET. OF COURSE, XI ISN'T DOING IT JUST BECAUSE HE'S SOME PANDA HUGGER. HE'S RESPONDING TO "GROWING PUBLIC ANGER ABOUT THE NOXIOUS AIR THAT ENVELOPS CHINESE CITIES." AND THESE CHINESE PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING THE EXCUSE THE GOVERNMENT PUT IN THE STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA:  "IT WAS THE DOG." ( APPLAUSE ) BUT WHATEVER THE MOTIVE, THANKS, CHINA. AND AS YOU TAKE A BOLD STEP TOWARD A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO HELP PREPARE YOU FOR A FUTURE WITH CLEAR SKIES. FIRST THINGS FIRST: THIS IS THE SUN. THIS IS SUNSCREEN. IT PROTECTS YOU-- IT'S LIKE SMOG YOU CAN RUB ON YOUR SKIN. THESE ARE CLOUDS. THAT BLUE STUFF IN BETWEEN THEM IS NOT A CHROMIUM SPILL. IT'S CALLED "THE SKY."

IS THAT A HARD SWITCH TO MAKE FROM, LIKE, A CRAZY CHARACTER TO A REAL PERSON? BECAUSE I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHICH DO I LIKE MORE? >> OH, MY GOODNESS. I DON'T KNOW. THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT AND, OBVIOUSLY, VERY DIFFERENT KINDS OF FILM MAKING, MAKING AN "X-MEN" MOVIE VERSUS MAKING THIS FILM "FREEHELD" >> Stephen: I'M NOT A MOVIE STAR. >> YOU SHOULD VISIT SOME DAY. >> Stephen: COULD I VISIT THE SET? >> YOU SHOULD COME HANG OUT. I THINK WHEN YOU PLAY A REAL PERSON AND SOMEONE WITH WHO IS AS INN SPIERG AND INCREDIBLE AS STACY WHO WENT THROUGH SOMETHING SO DIFFICULT AND DID SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL IN A TIME OF INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTY -- >> TELL THE PEOPLE-- >> YOU FEEL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. >> Stephen: LET ME TELL THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PART YOU'VE GOT HERE. THE MOVIE IS CALLED "FREEHELD" BASED ON A TRUE STORY ABOUT A POLICE DETECTIVE PLAYED BY JULIANNE PLOOR WHO IS DYING OF CANCER AND HAS TO FIGHT WITH COUNTY OFFICIALS TO ABE ALLOWED TO LEAVE HER POLICE PENSION TO HER DOMESTIC PARTNER, WHICH IS YOU. IS THIS A TRUE STORY? >> YES. >> Stephen: WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN? >> 10 YEARS AGO. >> Stephen: JUST 10 YEARS AGO. YOU ONLY CAME OUT AS OPENLY GAY ABOUT-- WHAT WAS IT, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> >> UH-HUH ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: IS IT-- IS IT STRIKING TO YOU THAT IN 2006, HAD THIS MOVIE TAKES PLACE, IT WAS NOT LEGAL TO BE GAY MARRIED IN 41 STATES. THERE WERE SPECIFIC LAWS IN 41 STATES AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE, AND ONLY ONE STATE WHERE IT WAS LEGAL, AND NOW LESS THAN 10 YEARS LATER, IT'S LEGAL ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WHAT DO YOU THINK ACCELERATED THIS ACCEPT APSE? >> WELL, I THINK FOR THE MOST PART, YOU KNOW, L.G.B.T. PEOPLE STARTED TO BECOME MORE VISIBLE. AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENS INTOLERANCE IS WITH LESS PEOPLE BEING OUT OF THE CLOSEET. AND THE MORE WE'VE HAD FILMS ON IT IN TELEVISION, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, INCREDIBLE ACTIVISTS LIKE LAUREL AND STACY IT REALLY CHANGES MINDS. IT TOUCHES PEOPLE'S HEARTS AND IT MAKES IT SHIFT FROM SEEING SOMETHING AS OTHER OR DIFFERENT AND, OF COURSE, REALIZES WE'RE ALL SAME, AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS EQUALITY AND TO GROW UP IN A SOCIETY THAT DOESN'T MAKE US FEEL LESS THAN, THAT DOESN'T MAKE US FEEL SHAME, AND DOESN'T MAKE US HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THAT, WHICH ARE REALLY DESTRUCTIVE. >> Stephen: WELL, WE HAVE-- WE HAVE A CLIP HERE FROM THE MOVIE ABOUT THE THE BEGINNING OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. >> HI. I SCREWED UP. I HAD NO RIGHT TO TALK TO YOU THE WAY I DID. I'VE RUINED OUR DATE AND I REALLY ENJOY BEING WITH YOU, AND I'M NERVOUS. MAYBE I AM TOO OLD FOR YOU. >> WILL YOU STOP SAYING THAT. IF ANYTHING, YOU'RE TOO SMART FOR ME. >> NO WAY. YOU'RE SMART, FUNNY, AND YOU'RE HONEST. AND BASICALLY, I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING. >> SO YOU CALLED TO SAY I'M AMAZING? >> YES. CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN? >> YEAH... YEAH, YOU CAN. ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THAT'S VERY SWEET. THAT'S VERY SWEET. IT'S-- IT'S ALMOST AS IF LES COUPLES ARE LIKE ALL OTHER COUPLES. >> IT'S CRAZY. >> Stephen: ISN'T IT CRAZY THAT WAY? >> Stephen: SOME OF THE PEOPLE PORTRAYED IN THE MOVIE, ONE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL MEMBERS SAID THEY CAN'T VOTE TO TRANSFER LAUREL'S PENSION TO YOUR CHARACTER BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW TALK ABOUT HOW THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ARE BEING INFRINGED UPON BY HAVING TO PROVIDE SERVICES OR HAVING TO PROVIDE BENEFITS THAT ARE AGAINST THE CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLE HAVING TO DO THE WORK OR CAST A VOTE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO FEEL THEIR RELIGIOUS RIGHT GO AHEAD OF, PERHAPS, YOUR MARRIAGE RIGHTS? >> WELL, WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS, LIKE, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS SO, SO IMPORTANT, IT'S SO, SO CRUCIAL. THROUGHOUT HISTORY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY HAS BEEN USED TO JUSTIFY DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER AND BASED ON RACE AND NOW IT'S THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY. >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAUGHT ONE THING THAT THEY BELIEVE AND IT'S A CORE BELIEF OF THEIRS, AND NOW THEY HAVE TO CHANGE IN THE FACE OF A CHANGING SOCIETY OR CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS? BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS I BELIEVE-- YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IN GOD, AND THERE ARE THINGS THEY BELIEVE THAT I KNOW ARE CRAZY. I KNOW THEY'RE NOT TRUE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW? GUARDIAN ANGELS-- NOT REAL, OKAY. I TOTALLY BELIEVE IN GUARDIAN ANGELS. THERE'S ONE OVER MY SHOULDER RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY? HE'S THE ONE WHO WIPED MY GLASSES RIGHT OFF MY FACE WHEN I WAS MAKING JOKES ABOUT THE POPE. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF SHOCKED BY THE CHANGE OF THE CULTURE? >> I THINK OFTEN PEOPLE JUST AREN'T-- THEY'RE JUST NOT EXPOSED, RIGHT? THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN EXPOSED. THEY HAVEN'T HAD AN INTERACTION WITH L.G.B.T. PEOPLE AND I REALLY, REALLY DO BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT IT IS TYPICALLY THAT. >> Stephen: A HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN NATIONAL VANGUARD AWARD ON SATURDAY. CONGRATULATIONS. >> THANK YOU.  ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: YOU ONLY BECAME PUBLIC ABOUT YOUR SEXUALITY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE A BURDEN NOW? NOW I HAVE TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF A MOVEMENT OR I HAVE TO REPRESENT SOMETHING? IS THAT EVER-- IS THAT EVER A PROBLEM OR BOTHER YOU, YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO? >> NO, I FEEL SO GRATEFUL FOR IT. I FEEL SO GRATEFUL TO FEEL HOW I FEEL NOW COMPARED TO HOW I FELT WHEN I WAS A CLOSETED PERSON. IT WAS NOT A NICE PLACE TO BE. I WAS SAD. IT IS TOXIC, AND I WISH NO ONE HAD TO LIVE THAT WAY. AND WHEN, YOU KNOW, AS A PERSON, I'M A VERY PRIVILEGED PERSON. I'M A VERY PRIVILEGED GAY PERSON, AND THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED THE MOST IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE, AND I FEEL SO GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT THINGS OR SHARE STORIES AND MEET INCREDIBLY INSPIRING PEOPLE OR HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY ME COMING OUT, WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT TO GET TO HAVE WITH A HUMAN BEING. SO REALLY WHAT I FEEL IS GRATITUDE. >> Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO FROM CANADA. >> I AM, YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: AND THAT COMES WITH A CERTAIN BURDEN. ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT EASIER-- IS IT EASIER TO BE GAY IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES? BECAUSE GAY MARRIAGE HAS BEEN LEGAL IN CANADA SINCE 2005. >> UH-HUH. >> Stephen: HAS IT DESTROYED MARRIAGE IN CANADA?

BUT THE BOOKS ON THEIR SHELF FOREVER. >> YOU'VE-- THAT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT, AND NOW I PROBABLY WILL NEVER WRITE AGAIN.

I WAS ACTING IN A MOVIE TODAY AND I WAS SO EXCITED DOING A SCENE IN THE MORNING AND WHEN IT ENDED I THOUGHT, "MY GOODNESS, I HOPE THIS NEVER COMES OUT." YOU FEEL MORTIFIED.

BUT THE BOOK, IT'S ALL ALONE. >> YES, YOU CAN'T BLAME ANYBODY ELSE, NO, NO, NO. >> Stephen: PEOPLE WRITE SUICIDE NOTES. PEOPLE DON'T MAKE SUICIDE MOVIES, YOU KNOW. THIS CAN BE A VERY HARROWING PROCESS. LIKE-- LIKE, YOU KNOW, I HAD A FRIEND COMPARE IT TO TRYING TO MAKE A SNOWMAN BY SCRAPING FROST OFF YOUR WINDSHIELD.

SO THIS SWITCH IS THE SIDES. >> SO THIS EAR HITS THIS SIDE AND THIS EAR HITS THIS SIDE? >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: I THINK YOU MIGHT GO INSANE. >> ACTUALLY, IF YOU WEAR IT A LOT IT BECOMES PERFECTLY NORMAL. YOUR BRAIN WILL SWAP. >> Stephen: IT WILL BE A VARIATION ON NORMAL, I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE INVENTIONS YOU'VE BROUGHT HERE TODAY. WHAT IS THIS AND THAT WHATDOES IT DO, OTHER THAN CREEP ME OUT? ( LAUGHTER ). >> THIS IS MY ATTEMPT AT CREATING WORLD PEACE. >> Stephen: HOW SO, DOMINIC? >> WELL, SOMEONE'S GOT TO TRY. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> SO THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE FALLEN OUT SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN'T EVEN BEAR TO SHAKE HANDS, SO THIS IS A PRE-HANDSHAKE HANDSHAKE DEVICE, WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO SHAKE HANDS WITHOUT TOUCHING SKIN. JUST AS A LITTLE STARTER IN THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: IT COULD ALSO-- IT COULD ALSO START A GLOBAL THUMB WAR, THOUGH, AT THE SAME TIME. LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE HAVE HERE. I LIKE-- I LIKE THIS ONE. THIS IS-- THESE ARE-- YOU CALL THESE G.P.S. SHOES. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: AND WHY AND HOW? WHY DO I WANT G.P.S. SHOES? WHAT WAS YOUR INSPIRATION? >> MY INSPIRATION WAS DOROTHY IN "THE WIZARD OF OZ." WHEN SHE CLICKS HER HEELS AFFECT, SHE GETS TAKEN BACK TO KANSAS, AND THESE ARE SHOES THAT YOU PLOT ON A MAP WHERE YOU WANT TO GO IN THE WORLD. THE SHOES KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. YOU CLICK THE HEELS TOGETHER. THERE'S A SWITCH IN THE BACK, WHICH START THE G.P.S. THE LEFT SHOE POINTS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DESTINATION, AND THE RIGHT SHOE -- >> CAN WE SHOW THAT RIGHT THERE? >> THAT IS A PROGRESS BAR. >> Stephen: WOW, THIS ONE RIGHT HERE IS TELLING ME WHICH DIRECTION TO WALK. >> THAT'S GOING OFF OF THERE. >> Stephen: AND WHAT'S OVER THERE? THESE ARE PROGRAMMED TO TAKE ME WHERE? >> THIS IS GOING BACK TO ENGLAND IF YOU WANT TO WALK ACROSS THE WATER. IT'S A WET WALK. THESE WOULD BE GOOD TO WEAR TO A CLUB IF YOU WANTED TO GET REALLY DRUNK. YOUR SHOES COULD TELL YOU WHICH WAY TO GO HOME. ( LAUGHTER ). >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: IT ALSO WOULD MAKE A GOOD MURDER WEAPON BECAUSE YOU COULD PROGRAM THESE TO WALK SOMEONE OFF A CLIFF AND SAY, "HERE, TRY THESE ON. THESE WILL TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO." >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE WE'VE GOT HERE. THIS IS-- TALK ME THROUGH WHAT THIS IS. HOLD ON. TAKE THOSE OFF. WHAT AM I DOING HERE? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS? >> I HAD THIS IDEA IN THE BATH. I GOT A TEXT, BUT WHEN YOUR HAND ARE WET YOU CAN'T USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE SCREEN. YOU COULD USE YOUR NOSE TO SCROLL BUT IT'S TOO CLOSE. YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING. >> Stephen: THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. THAT ACTUALLY WORKS. AND THIS IS GOOD IF FOR SOME REASON MY OTHER HAND WAS OCCUPIED.  ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY, VERY NICE, VERY NICE. OOPS. WHERE DID MY GLASSES GO? DID I TAKE OFF MY GLASSES AGAIN? I HAVE DESTROYED-- I'VE ANGERED -- OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WHAT ARE THESE? >> I MAKE WATCH SCULPTURES. >> Stephen: ARE YOU A SCULPTOR ORA YOU AN INVENTOR. THESE THINGS SEEM LIKE CONCEPTUAL ART AT THE SAME TIME AS BEING INVENTIVE? >> I JUST LIKE BEING IMAGINATIVE AND CREATIVE AND I DON'T CARE HOW I EXPRESS IT. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE CALLED? >> NO, BUT PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ME THAT QUESTION. >> Stephen: COULD INVENT A WORD? >> I TRIED MANY TIMES. I DID MY BUSINESS CARDS BEFORE I CAME HERE AND UNDERNEATH MY NAME ADVENTURE-ER. HALF INTVENTOR AND HALF ADVENTURER. I HAVE TINY LITTLE FIGURES ON THE HANDS OF WATCHES -- >> SO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE GO AROUND AS THE HAND GOES AROUND. >> THIS IS, YES AN ELDERLY LADY WITH LOTS OF BAGS GOING AROUND ON THE SECOND HAND AND TWO PEOPLE ARE HOGGING THE SEAT ON THE SUBWAY AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING HER THE SEAT SO SHE GOES AROUND AND AROUND. >> Stephen: SO THIS IS A SALUTE TO JERKS >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: WHAT'S THIS ONE RIGHT HERE? >> THIS IS A GIFT TO YOU. I'VE RECREATED THE STUDIO. SO THERE'S A MINIATURE VERSION OF YOU SITTING AT YOUR DESK AND THE TWO BLUE CHAIRS. AND THEN WHEN I START IT, THERE'S A GUEST GOING AROUND, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU-- THIS IS A REPRESENTATION OF YOUR LIFE, REALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THIS IS-- THANK YOU. THIS IS-- THIS IS THE SECOND NICEST DEPICTION OF MY MORTALITY THAT I'VE EVER RECEIVED. OKAY, NOW THIS ONE OVER HERE IS FASCINATING TO ME. LET ME GET OVER HERE. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO AND WHAT DOES IT DO? >> PUT THIS ON YOUR HEAD. ALL RIGHT? >> Stephen: IS IT-- IS IT EASIER TO BE ECCENTRIC WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENGLISH ACCENT? BECAUSE-- ( LAUGHTER ). >> IT'S NATURALLY-- >> Stephen: I'D LIKE YOU TO PUT THIS CRANE ON YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW. SOUNDS BETTER THAN-- MY NAME'S DOMINIC AND I'M GONNA STRAP A SHOVEL TO YOUR HEAD. HOLD STILL. WHAT I DO DO? >> THIS IS A CEREAL SERVING HEAD CRANE DEVICE, OBVIOUSLY. >> Stephen: A CEREAL SERVING HEAD CRANE DEVICE. >> YOU PUSH THESE LEVERS I HAD CRAWLICALLY CONTROLLED MICK. PUSH THAT DOWN. >> Stephen: PUSH THIS ONE DOWN. OKAY. THAT'S NICE. AND THEN-- >> LIFT THAT ONE UP. >> Stephen: LIFT THIS ONE UP LIKE THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH! OH! AND WHAT IS THIS ONE FOR? >> THIS IS FOR SQUIRTING THE MILK OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: NOT ONLY-- DOMINIC, NOT ONLY IS THIS PRACTICAL BUT A HELL OF A DIET PLAN. WELL, DOMINIC WILCOX, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. DOMINIC WILCOX, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ >> Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR "THE LATE SHOW." TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE: JOHN OLIVER, EVAN SPIEGEL, BILL WITHERS, AND ED SHEERAN. NOW STICK AROUND FOR MR. JAMES CORDEN. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
