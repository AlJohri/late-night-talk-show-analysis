SOME OF YOU HAD A LONG WEEKEND BECAUSE TODAY IS COLUMBUS DAY. WE DON'T HAVE IT OFF HERE. WE DON'T HAVE IT OFF HERE. EVIDENTLY CBS JUST DOESN'T CARE ABOUT CELEBRATING THE DISCOVERY OF THE CAPITOL OF OHIO. (LAUGHTER) I THINK THAT'S SAD. OF COURSE I WAS BROUGHT UP TO CELEBRATE COLUMBUS DAY THE ONLY WAY THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE, MATTRESS SALES. (LAUGHTER) PLUS 60% OFF ALL BEDDING ITEMS. IT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE COLUMBUS LOVED A GOOD SALE. (LAUGHTER) HE DID. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S TRUE, NO, IT'S TRUE. CHECK THE HISTORICAL RECORDS, WHEN HE LANDED IN AMERICA, HE GOT 100 PERCENT OFF ALL LAND. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS GREAT, WHAT A DEAL. WHAT A DEAL. IT WAS LIKE NATIVE AMERICANS WERE JUST GIVING IT AWAY. LAUGH AV THEY WEREN'T. BUT IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE. HOW DID THEY KEEP THEIR PRICES SO LOW? VOLUME, VOLUME, WE TOOK IT. ANYWAY, ENOUGH TALK. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO I AM TALKING TO LATER. I AM VERY EXCITED FOR TONIGHT'S TAKEY TALK. FIRST I WILL BE TALKING WITH OSCAR NOMINEE CAREY MULLIGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DID YOU SEE HER EARLIER? AMAZINGLY TALENTED. HER NEW FILM "SUFFRAGETTE" IS THE MOVING STORY OF THE FIGHT FOR WOMEN'S RITES TO VOTE IN EARLY 20th CENTURY ENGLAND. AND SPOILER ALERT, THEY GET THE VOTE AND THEN ELECT QUEEN ELIZABETH. IT'S AMAZING. SHE JUST KEEPS WINNING. SHE JUST KEEPS WINNING. NOW THEN I WILL BE TALKING TO ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAMER ELVIS COSTELLO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN KEEPING WITH THE STRICT MORAL STANDARDS OF THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER, I WILL BE INTERVIEWING ELVIS FROM THE WAIST UP. AND WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY DAR LEAN LOVE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: I LOVE THE LOVE. YOU GOT TO LOVE THE LOVE. SHE IS BOTH A STAR IN HER OWN RIGHT AND THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS BACKUP SINGER. SHE'S LIKE BRUCE STRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND, LIKE TOM PETTY AND THE HEART BRACKERS. SHE'S LIKE MACK RONEE AND THE CHEESE. OH, FOLKSIX DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU. THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK THINGS OFF.  BUT FIRST, A NEW SURVEY HAS FOUND THAT OVER ONE-THIRD OF VEGETARIANS WILL EAT MEAT WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK. IT IS COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME EXCUSE FOR GOING TO TACO BELL. >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES CAREY MULLIGAN. ELVIS COSTELLO. AND MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY DARLENE LOVE. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN.  AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WHOOO! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH! THANK YOU. OH, SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WEEKEND. SUNNY AND CRISP AT THE SAME TIME PERFECT FALL WEEKEND. DID YOU HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND, JON? >> Jon: YEAH, KILLIN. >> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO? >> Jon: WELL, I DID THE PHOTO SHOOT. >> Stephen: OH, DID YOU THAT PHOTO SHOOT FOR-- . >> Jon: KATE SPAID. >> Stephen: YEAH, THAT IS SOME HIGH FASHION.  WAS IT GOOD? >> Jon: YEAH, IT WAS GOOD. >> Stephen: WAS IT ALL ON THE UP AND UP, PHOTOS YOU WOULDN'T MIND YOUR PARNS SEEING. >> Jon: YEAH. >> Stephen: I THOUGHT IT WASJ UST YOU AND A HANDBAG, NOTHING ELSE. >> Jon: WE DID THAT. >> Stephen: YOU DID THAT, OKAY .THAT WILL MOVE SOME PRODUCT. >> Jon: IT'S GOING TO PUSH IT, MAN, YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO GET OUT THERE. >> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE YOU CANS AY THAT ON CBS,  BUT ALL RIGHT. THE POINT IS, AUTUMN HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. THE LEAVES ARE STARTING TO CHANGE. OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO WANT TO CHANGE. (LAUGHTER) VERY IMPORTANT AND OF COURSE WITH THE FALL COMES THE NEW TV SEASON. AND TOMORROW NIGHT THERE'S ONE SHOW EVERYONE IS EXCITED ABOUT. NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SEASON FOUR PREMIER OF CHICAGO FIRE. YOU REALLY THINK THEY WOULD HAVE PUT THAT FIRE OUT BY NOW. FOUR YEARS, RIGHT DOWN THERE. NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT CNN'S DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: EXCITEMENT. LISTEN TO THAT, MAN. OH MY GOD. YOU-- YOU JUST MADE THE PEOPLE AT CNNTU RGID. IT'S GOTS ALL THE BIG PLAYERS YOU LOVE. IT'S GOT HILLARY CLINTON, BERNIE SANDERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: CHIEF BIG GUY HERE. WHAT'S HIS NAME, AND THE OTHER ONE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE I LOVE THE OTHER ONE. I LOVE OTHER ONE. MY MONEY IS ON OTHER ONE. OF COURSE, THE LAST CNN REPUBLICAN DEBATE GOT CNN'S HIGHEST RATINGS OF ALL TIME THANKS TO THE PRESSING NATIONAL ISSUE OF, OH LOOK, IT'S DONALD TRUMP. SO ACTUAL SIGH. SO HOW CAN CNN GET YOU JUST AS EXCITED FOR A TRUMPLESS DEMOCRATIC DEBATE? THE ANSWER IS SOMEONE ELSE WHO WON'T BE THERE. >> WE HAVE REALLY JUST PREPPED EVERYTHING HERE FOR THE CNN DEBATE JUST IN CASE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN DECIDES TO SHOW UP. THERE IT IS, THE EXTRA PODIUM JUST IN CASE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN DECIDES TO SHOW UP. >> Stephen: YEAH, THERE THEY'VE GOT AN EXTRA PODIUM JUST IN CASE BIDEN DROPS BY, LIKE YOU DO YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES ARE BASICALLY AN OPEN MIC NIGHT. (LAUGHTER) COULD BE BIDEN, COULD BE CARROT TOP. (LAUGHTER) AND-- AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITING IT WOULD BE IF BIDEN DID APPEAR AT THE LAST SECOND. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO. BECAUSE CNN'S JIM ACOSTA IMAGINES NEWS FOR YOU. >> VICE PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN, WILL HE OR WON'T HE. WILL THE AIR FORCE 2 SUDDENLY START FLYING THIS WAY, START FLYING WESTWARD TOWARDS LAS VEGAS ON TUESDAY NIGHT IN A DRAMATIC LANDING AT McCARON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. THE SPEEDING MOTORCADE OVER TO THE WYNN HOTEL, BIDEN WITH THE AVIATOR GLASSES PUT ON. CAN I SEE A SITUATION, JOHN, WHERE HE PULLS IN IN THAT YELLOW CORVETTE WITH THE AVIATORS ON AND JUST SAYS, LET'S DO THIS THING. IT WILL BE FUN TO MUCH WHAT. IT WILL BE FASCINATING POLITICAL TELEVISION IF THE VICE PRESIDENT DECIDES TO JOIN IN. >> Stephen: THAT WOULD FASCINATING. (LAUGHTER) IT WOULD BE FASCINATING POLITICAL TELEVISION. AND IT'S A GREAT NEW STRATEGY FOR CABLE NEWS. DESCRIBING THINGS MORE COMPELLING THAN WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING NOW. CNN, IT COULD GET INTERESTING. (LAUGHTER) BUT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JIM A KOSES-- ACOSTA HAS A GOOD POINT. COULD BIDEN FLY TO VEGAS, PUT ON HIS AVIATOR SUNGLASSES AND STRIDE INTO THE ROOM? COULD HE THEN MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH A CERTAIN REPORTER. COULD THEY END UP CHATTING AND GETTING ALONG, GOING OUT FOR BEERS AFTERWARDS REALIZE THEG HAVE A TON IN COMMON AND BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW IT THE SUN IS COMING UP AND THEY'VE TALKED ALL NIGHT? COULD BIDEN THEN ASK, DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT REPORTING FROM SPACE? THEN, COULD HE THEN SEND THAT REPORTER UP IN A ROCKET TO BECOME THE FIRST REPORTER EVER TO WIN A PULITZER PRIZE ON THE MOON? THAT WOULD TOTALLY SHAKE UP THE CAMPAIGN. AND AS LONG AS WE'RE REPORTING BREAKING UP TO THE MINUTE FAN FICTION-- (LAUGHTER) WHY NOT SPECULATE ON OTHER EXCITING POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. >> COULD PAUL RYAN UNEXPECTEDLY SWITCH PARTY, RAPPEL DOWN FROM THE CEILING AND START DEBATING BERNIE SANGDERS. I MEAN ANYBODY COULD THEY RECEIPTICALLY JOIN IN, WHY NOT JESSE VENTURA, WHY NOT ANIMAL FROM THE MUPPET, THE REUNITED CAST OF FAMILY MATTERS, OR PERHAPS A BIZARRO WORLD DONALD TRUMP WHO HAS A COMBOVER GOATEE AND WANTS TO ROUND UP EVERYBODY IN MEXICO AND KICK THEM INTO THE UNITED STATES. LET'S FACE IT. A LAST MINUTE DROP IN FROM VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WITHOUT MAKE HISTORY. AND CNN ISN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS BOTH A FANTASTIC IMAGINATION AND ACCESS TO PODIUM TECHNOLOGY. BRING IT ON OUT, BOYS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 7 THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS, MR. VICE PRESIDENT. YOUR VERY OWN PODIUM. CAN YOU IMAGINE RIGHT NOW AIR FORCE 2 COULD BE HEADING EAST TOWARD MANHATTAN. IT DIVES DOWN FOR A LAND ON BROADWAY, SPARKS FLYING AS THE WINGS SCRAPE AGAINST THE BILLBOARDS IN TIME SQUARE. JOE BIDEN PERSONALLY PILOTING IT TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER. HE POPS THE WINDOW HATCH, HOPS OUT OF THE COCKPIT IN A BOMBER JACKET AND THE COP TELLS HIM HEY, YOU DOUBLE PARKED. WITHOUT BREAKING A STRIDE BIDEN TOSSES HIM THE KEYS AND SAYS PUT IT ON MY BILL.  THEN HE KICKS DOWN THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE THEATER AND THROUGH THE ROAR OF THE AUDIENCE, AND A PIE YO TECH NIK DISPLAY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) -- AND WITH A PYROTECHNIC DISPLAY I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS LEGAL INSIDE HERE, THE VICE PRESIDENT STRIDES UP TO THAT VERY PODIUM, PUTS ON HIS AVIATOR GLASSES, THEN WHIPS THEM OFF AGAIN AND SAYS, WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET LAID! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, HEY! HEY, IT COULD HAPPEN. TUNE IN TOMORROW TO SEE IF BIDEN SHOWS UP HERE. AFTER ALL, THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL HE'S GOING TO BE AT THAT DEBATE. STICK AROUND. WE'VE GOT CAREY MULLIGAN AND ELVIS COSTELLO. >> THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY THE PREMIER REWARD GOLD CARD FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS. IT'S THE GEAR THAT GETS IT DONE. >> Stephen: HEY!WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO MANY GREAT THINGS ON THE INTERNET. ON TV TOO. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A DYING MEDIUM. (LAUGHTER) ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO INTERNET AT IS TED TALKS. THE WEB LECTURE SERIES WHERE EXPERTS FROM A VARIETY OF FIELDS EXPLAIN COMPLEX IDEAS IN ACCESSIBLE, ENTERTAINK WAYS. IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF TED TALKS, CONGRATULATIONS ON QUITTING FACEBOOK IN 2005. SINCE 2006 TED TALKS HAVE AMASSED 1 BILLION VIEWS. OR ROUGHLY HALF THE VIEWS OF JUSTIN BIEBER'S PENIS. BUT NOT EVERY TED TALK MAKES THE CULT CUT. ORGANIZERS SAY THEY REVIEW THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CANDIDATES EVERY YEAR BEFORE CHOOSING JUST 60 TO 70 SPEAKERS MAKING IT THE ONLY ORGANIZATION WITH MORE REJECTED CANDIDATES THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. (LAUGHTER) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,-- (APPLAUSE) OH, OH, OH SOME OF THEM ARE GONE, SO SOON. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I THINK IT'S HEARTBREAKING THAT THESE THINKERS PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO THEIR PRESENTATIONS ON TO SEE THEM NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. UNTIL NOW. BECAUSE I RECENTLY OBTAINED THIS BOX OF TED TALK LECTURES THAT DID NOT MAKE THE CUT. THESE ARE 18 MINUTE LECTURES BY EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD THAT FOR SOME REASON TED, WHOEVER HE IS-- (LAUGHTER). >> Stephen: DIDN'T THINK WERE GOOD ENOUGH. WELL NOTHING'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THEM TONIGHT IN OUR NEW SEGMENT REJEC-TED. >> LADIES AND GENTLES. BIG ONES AND WEE ONES. IT IS A FACT OF LIFE THAT WE ALL WANT PUDDING. AS A CULTURE WE NEED TO LEARN THAT PUDIN COMES AT A COST. THERE IS ONE SIMPLE TRUTH WE NEED TO CONFRONT. IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT, YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY PUDIN. HOW CAN YOU HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT? YOU, YES, YOU, LADDIE. PUDDING COMES AT A COST. BUT I AM HERE TO TELL YOU IF WE ALL EAT OUR MEAT, WE WILL ALL GET A PUDDING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> THANK YOU! >> AND THEN WE SPENT A WEEK AT THE BEACH AND I SAW HORSESHOE CRABS AND. AND I RODE A CAR O SELL AND A DOG WASHED UP ON THE BEACH AND DAD SAID IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE IT WAS ASLEEP. AND THEN I GOT IN THE CAR. AND THEN I PLAYED GAMES ON MY BROTHER'S PHONE. AND THEN IABILITY MORE PAN CAKES THAN I EVER ATE BEFORE. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY NEXT BUT THAT WAS MY VACATION. AND I LOVE MY GRANDMA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: THOSE VIDEOS ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE HERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CAREY MULLIGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) . >> Stephen: HELL YEAH, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY,  MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS APPEARED IN SUCH FILMS AS AN EDUCATION DRIVE AND THE GREAT GATSBY AND NOW STARS IN THE FILM "SUFFRAGETTE" PLEASE WELCOME CAREY MULLIGAN. (APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? GOSH, IT'S HUGE. >> Stephen: ISN'T IT LOVELY? >> LOVELY. >> Stephen: DID YOU START ONSTAGE? >> NO, MY FIRST JOB WAS A FILM AND THEN I DID A PLAY. >> Stephen: DID YOU GO STRAIGHT TO OSCAR NOMINEE, STRAIGHT FOR THAT THING? LET'S CUT AROUND THE MIDDLEMAN HERE. >> WHO NEEDS NEEDS IT. >> YEAH, I JUST WENT FOR THE FAME. >> Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE DONE PRETTY WELL.  AND YOU HAVE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, EDUCATION, THE GREAT GATSBY, AND YOUR CURRENT FILM IS SUFFRAGETTE WHICH TELLS THE STORY OF THE BRITISH WOMEN SU FFRAGE MOVEMENT. WHEN DID WOMEN GET THE VOTE IN ENGLAND. BECAUSE I FEEL ODDLY TIED TO WOMEN GETTING THE VOTED IN UNITED STATES. BECAUSE MY MOM WAS BORN TWO DAYS BEFORE WOMEN COULD FIRST VOTE IN THE UNITED STATES. >> WOW. >> Stephen: AND SO IT'S WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF ONE I LOVED. SO IT'S A VERY REAL THING TO ME.  WHEN DID WOMEN GET THE VOTE IN ENGLAND. >> SO WOMEN, PROPERTY-OWNING WOMEN AND WOMEN OVER 30, PRORTD-OWNING WOMEN, THEY HAD LOTS OF KAF YETS, THAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE WAR, SO 1918 AND IT WAS 1928 WHERE ALL WOMEN-- . >> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE TO BE MARRIED? >> YES, NO, I THINK WERE YOU MARRIED OR PROPERTY-OWNING. >> Stephen: OKAY YOU COULD BE-- . >> Stephen: BUT OVER 30.YEAH. >> Stephen: BECAUSE BEFORE YOU KNOW, WOMEN ARE JUST CRAZY. (LAUGHTER) >> I JUST TURNED 30 AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I CAN HANDLE THE VOTE. >> Stephen: YOUR CHARACTER'S NAME IS MAU DE AND A FICTIONALIZED CHARACTER BASED ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT WOMEN. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: WHAT IS HER EXPERIENCE? SHE'S NOT SORT OF A MONEYED WOMAN WHO IS DOING THIS AS A GOOD DEED. THIS IS I A VERY PERSONAL TO HER.  WHAT IS HER LIFE. >> SO SHE SAY WORKING CLASS WOMAN.  SHE WORKS IN A LAUNDRY IN LONDON, IN THE EAST END, A VERY POOR AREA OF TOWN BACK THEN. AND SHE IS PRETTY APATHETI KRRK IT WAS VERY CONVENTIONAL TO BELIEVE THAT WOMEN HAD THEIR PLACE IN THE HOME AT THE TIME. AND SHE WAS TRADITIONAL AND DOESN'T FEEL ENGAGED WITH THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. AND IS SORT OF LIVING WITH HER LOT, KIND OF GETTING BY. AND SHE MEETS THESE WOMEN, THESE SUFFRAGETTE WOMEN WHO INSPIRE HER TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A BETTER LIFE OUT THERE FOR HER. AND GAINING THE VOTE COULD GIVE HER THE POWER TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE. SO SHE GETS KIND OF SWEPT UP INTO THIS BIG MOVEMENT. >> Stephen: AND THE MOVEMENT FACED ENORMOUS RESISTANCE. IT'S NOT JUST YOU CAN'T HAVE IT. THERE WAS ACTUALLY VIOLENCE AGAINST THESE WOMEN AND THEY COMMITTED A LITTLE VIOLENCE IN RETURN. >> YEAH. SO WOMEN IN ENGLAND PROTESTED-- CAMPAIGNED FOR THE VOTE VERY POLITELY FOR ABOUT 50 YEARS. GOING TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PETITIONING FOR WOMEN TO HAVE THE VOTE. AND THAT WAS SORT OF SWEPT UNDER THE CARPET. >> Stephen: WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT IF WE GOT THE VOTE, WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT. >> PLEASE, SIR. SHALL WE HAVE THE VOTE? AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. AND SO EMILEN AND SUPPORTED BY OTHER PEOPLE, SOME MEN, SOME POLITICIANS DECIDED THAT THE NEXT STEP WAS TO START OF-- SORT OF START DOING STUFF. AND THEY DID A LOT OF STUFF. >> Stephen: AND THEY GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. >> THEY GOT IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. AND THERE WERE LOTS OF FIGHTS WITH POLICE AND RIOTS AND BLOG UP BUILDINGS, ALL SORTS OF THINGS. >> Stephen: WOW, YOU DON'T THINK OF THESE WOMEN BLOG UP BUILDINGS TO GET A VOTE. >> I HAVE AN IDEA OF A WOMAN POLITELY MARCHING THROUGH THE STREETS. >> Stephen: RIGHT, I LEARNED ABOUT SUFFRAGETTES FROM WATCHING MARY POPINS, YOU KNOW. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: VOTE FOR WOMEN, VOTE FOR WOMEN. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: AT ANY POINT IN THIS FILM DO YOU FLY? NO DANCING PENGUINS. >> I FOUGHT FOR A FLYING SCENE AND THEY SAID NO. BUT I DO GET TO RUN AWAY FROM A BLOWED UP BUILDING. >> Stephen: YOU DO THAT THING WHERE YOU JUST WALK TOWARD THE CAMERA LIKE THIS AND DON'T LOOK BACK AND IT EXPLODES BEHIND YOU. >> WE HAD A REAL EXPLOSION AND WE HAD A CAR AND A CAMERA. WE WERE SORT OF RUNNING. I NEVER GET TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT IN FILMS SO I WAS THRILLED. >> Stephen: WE ACTUALLY  HAVE A CLIP HERE. I BELIEVE YOUR CHARACTER HAS BEEN ARRESTED. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: AND SHE IS FACING STERN OPPOSITION FROM  THE AUTHORITIES. JIM? >> WE BROKE WINDOWS. WE BURN THINGS, BECAUSE WAR IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE MEN LISTEN TO. BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEATEN US AND BETRAYED US AND THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LEFT. >> AND THERE'S NOTHING LEFT BUT TO STOP YOU. >> WHAT YOU GOING TO DO. LOCK EVERYONE UP? WE'RE IN EVERY HOME, HALF THE HUMAN RACE, YOU CAN'T STOP THE WORLD. >> YOU MIGHT LOSE YOUR LIFE BEFORE THIS IS OVER. >> WE WILL WIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: HONEST TO GOD, I, UNFORTUNATELY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET. BUT I WATCHED THE TRAILER. AND I-- YOU GOT ME. YOU TOTALLY GOT ME BY THE HEART STRINGS. WHAT IS IT LIKE DOING A MOVIE THAT IS SO BEAUTIFULLY ACCURATE TO ITS PERIOD. IS IT LIKE TIME TRAVELING? CUZ YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE KONGED YOU OVER THE HEAD AND BLEW ON SET AND SAID IT'S 1912, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT. >> YEAH, I WILL GO WITH IT. YEAH, THEY DID-- THEY RECREATED LOTS OF REALLY FAMOUS, SHOT IN THE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT WHICH HASN'T BEEN DONE SINCE THE 50s IN ENGLAND. SO THAT WAS COOL. AND WE SHOT A LOT IN EAST END OF LONDON IN A PLACE, WHICH I THINK IS LIKE WILLIAMSBURG HERE, VERY HIP. >> Stephen: THE HIPSTERS.LIKE TRENDY TRENDY PEOPLE THAT  WE'RE SCARED OF. AND THEY ALL WEAR KIND OF LIKE ANTIQUE VINTAGEY CLOTHING AND LOOK VERY COOL.  SO WE HAD A GAME, CUZ THEY USED TO WANDER ON OUR SET SO WE HAD THIS GAME CALLED HIPSTER OR EXTRA. >> Stephen: MER ILL STREEP IS IN THIS MOVIE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: SHE PLAYS EMILENE. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO HAVE HER ON THE SET? DOES IT CHANGE THE TONE? IS IT INTIMIDATING. >> ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND EVERYONE IS VERY EXCITED ALL DAY. ALL THE CREW. ALL THE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, KIND OF QUITE SCARY CREW MEMBERS, THE BIG GUYS, THE TOUGH GUYS, THEY ARE ALL FUZZY AND EXCITED. >> Stephen: BETWEEN YOU AND MERILL STREEP, WHICH OF YOU HAS  THE MORE ACCURATE ENGLISH ACCENT? (LAUGHTER) >> DEFINITELY HER. >> Stephen: DEFINITELY HER? >> Stephen: CAREY, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> Stephen: THANK YOU.THE FILM IS SUFFRAGETTE T OPENS IN SELECT THEATERS OCTOBER 23rd.

AND THE SHOW IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST SHOW, WE DO FIVE A WEEK INSTEAD OF FOUR A WEEK. WE DO AN HOUR A NIGHT INSTEAD OF A HALF HOUR AN NIGHT. AND WE DO IT TWO HOURS EARLIER THAN WE USED TO. SO I HAVE ZERO TIME IN MY DAY TO HANG OUT WITH MY STAFF OR MEET WITH MY PRODUCERS, THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE SHOW THAT YOU ARE SEEING THAT NIGHT. AND THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT IT'S ABOUT. BUT I ASKED HER TO HAVE THIS MEETING WITH ME SO LONG AGO THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT'S ABOUT. >> THAT MAKES SENSE. >> Stephen: SO THIS IS IT, GO, WHAT DO YOU NEED TO FIND OUT FROM ME? >> DID YOU WATCH THE RITUAL-- . >> Stephen: THE WHAT.THE RITUALS  QUICK TIME. >> Stephen: THE SCENE ABOUT RITUALS I DID BEFORE THE SHOW, HAVE I NOT WATCHED IT. >> OKAY, PERFECT. >> Stephen: HOW LONG AGO DID YOU SEND IT TO ME. >> LIKE MIDDLE OF LAST WEEK. >> Stephen: NO, HAVE I NOT WATCHED IT, HOW LONG IS IT. >> ABOUT THREE AND A HALF. >> Stephen: I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT. >> OKAY, PERFECT.

ELVIS COSTELLO, UNFAILTFUL MUSIC AND DISAPPEARING INK. >> UH-HUH. >> Stephen: WHY ARE YOU WRITING A MEMOIR? WHY TAKE AWAY THE GAME THAT THE REST OF US HAVE TO TRY TO DESIEFER WHAT THE LETTERKS IN YOUR SONGS MEAN? I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT BUTTERFLY FEES ON A DEAD MONKEY'S HAND MEAN. >> YOU WILL FIND OUT. >> Stephen: DO I REALLY FIND OUT IF I READ THE BOOK. >> YES, YOU WILL. >> Stephen: WHY DID YOU WRITE A BOOK. >> I WAS ASKED TO WRITE IT WHEN I WAS 24. >> Stephen: RECENTLY.YEAH. AND I FIGURED MAYBE I SHOULD DO SOME THINGS FIRSTMENT SO NOW I HAVE DONE SOME THINGS. >> Stephen: HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO YOU WRITE THIS? >> I STARTED ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND I TORE UP A LOT OF VERSIONS OF TMENT THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS I WENT TO WORK AT IT. >> Stephen: IS IT HARDER THAN WRITING A SONG? >> IT'S LONGER. >> Stephen: BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO RHYME ANYTHINGMENT DON'T HAVE TO RHYME ANYTHING. >> I DID OCCASIONALLY FIND MYSELF GOING INTO RHYME BY ACCIDENT. >> Stephen: DID YOU REALLY. I HAD TO STOP MYSELF, CAREFULLY LOOK AT THE CHAPTERS THAT BE IN RHYME AND I DIDN'T REALIZE HI WRITTEN THEM. >> Stephen: THERE WERE COUPLETS AT THE END. >> ACCIDENTALLY, YEAH. >> Stephen: DID YOU DO ANY RESEARCH ON YOUR OWN LIFE BECAUSE, NO, I'M SERIOUS. >> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT NOT REMEMBER EVERYTHING QUITE CLEARLY. >> Stephen: YOU SUGGEST THAT YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER EVERYTHING QUITE CLEARLY. >> OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME PERIODS IN A YOUNG MAN'S LIFE THAT HE CAN'T REMEMBER WELL AND HE WOULD RATHER FORGET. BUT I-- I OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CURSE OR GIFT OF A MEMORY. AND I CAN CAN REMEMBER THINGS IN GREAT DETAIL.  BUT YES, OCCASIONALLY YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AN CHECK WAS IT BEFORE OR AFTER I DID THAT THING. >> Stephen: DID YOU.AFTER THE  HUMAN SACRIFICE OR BEFORE. >> Stephen: DID YOU FIND OUT THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF OR DID YOU REMEMBER THINGS ABOUT YOURSELF THAT YOU PERHAPS DIDN'T WANT TO? THE LATE GREAT DAVID CARR WROTE A BOOK CALLED NIETD OF THE GUN AND HE FINDS OUT WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT THAT BOOK ABOUT HIS OWN LIFE, HE FOUND OUT, OH, HELL, I'M NOT THE HERO OF MY OWN STORY.  ARE YOU THE HERO OF YOUR OWN BOOK? >> I HOPE I DIDN'T SET OUT TO WRITE IT FOR THOSE REASONS. >> Stephen: NO, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO. >> I DID ACTUALLY WRITE ONE PASS AGE AND IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT MAYBE IT WASN'T THE RIGHT THING TO SAY AM BUT I THINK IT IS TRUTHFUL. I SAID THERE IS A TIME WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS WHERE YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THE SUBJECT. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAVE, SOME THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE AND THAT'S OKAY TO WRITE THOSE DOWN AND LOOK BACK AT THINGS. THEN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS IN THE STORY WHICH ARE TRYING TO, IF NOT EXPLAIN AT LEAST LAY OUT HOW I CAME TO HEAR MUSIC THE WAY I DID. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER. >> Stephen: YOUR LIFE IN SOMEWAYS  IS GREATLY ABOUT YOUR FATHER I DIDN'T REALIZE BECAUSE I SAW CLIPS THAT SOMEONE SHOWED ME TODAY AM I WITH LIKE TO SHOW THE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A CLIP OF YOUR FATHER. TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOUR FATHER DID FOR A LIVING. >> MY FATHER SANG WITH A DANCE BAND THAT WAS SORT OF LIKE, NOT IN THE SAME ERA OF GLEN MILLER BUT MODELED ON THE GLEN MILLER. SAX PHONES, TROAM BONES. THE BAND WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THEY ACTED LIKE A SIN THEY SIZER FOR POPULAR MUS YOU CAN.  IN ENGLAND WE ONLY HAD ABOUT 12 MINUTES OF POPULAR MUSK I A DAY. THE REST OF THE TIME IT WAS PEOPLE DESCRIBING KNITTING PATTERNS AND READING THE WEATHER PARENT. >> Stephen: ON THE BBC, VERY SOBER IT ISN'T THE WAY IT IS YOU ANIMATION-- IMITATION OF  AMERICAN RADIO.  WHEN I GREW UP YOU COULD SWITCH ON THE RADIO AND STILL THINK IT WAS 1935. SO MY FATHER WAS WITH THIS BOOND. HE BROUGHT HOME STACKS OF RECORDS EVERY WEEK, THAT WERE FROM THE DHART-- CHARTS AND AT THIS POINT THEY HAD THIS BAND WITH SAX PHONES AND TROM BONES AND THIS IS A BIG BAND AND HAD TO SING LIKE A ROLLING STONE AND SUBSTITUTE. >> Stephen: OR THIS SONG.

(LAUGHTER) >> COME ON NOW, ANYBODY THAT KNOWS HAS EVER SEEN ME DANCE YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN FAILING FOR 40 YEARS. >> Stephen: EVEN DOWN TO THE STANCE, LIKE THE PIGEON TOE STANCE. WAS THAT COGNIZANT. >> IT IS GENETIC. >> Stephen: I LOVE THAT FOOTAGES O MUCH. >> DID YOU EVER PERFORM WITH YOUR FATHER? >> I DID A FEW TIMES. WHEN I WAS AN APPRENTICE, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 17. HE HAD GIVEN UP SINGING WITH THE BAND IN THE LATE '60S AND TOOK TO THE ROAD AND SINGING SONGS OF PEACE AND LOVE. AND HE GREW HIS HAIR LONG.  HE KIND OF LOOKED LIKE PETER SELLERS IN WHAT'S NEW PU SSYCAT IF YOU KNOW THAT, OR A YOUNGER PEOPLE AUSTIN POKERS WITH. AND I WENT WITH HIM TO A SEASIDE RESORT IN THE NORTHWEST OF ENGLAND THAT IS KIND OF LIKE LAS VEGAS ONLY WITHOUT THE SIN. OR ACTUALLY THE FUN. AND I WENT ALONG WITH MY LITTLE ELECTRIC GUITAR AND SAT IN WITH THE BAND. THE ORGANIST GAVE ME A NOTE WHILE WE WERE BACK STAGE BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND THE ORGAN, AND JON WILL BEAR ME OUT, THEY ARE LIKE-- THEY TAKE AWHILE TO GET GOING AND IT WENT INTO PITCH JUST AS THE CURTAIN WENT UP. AND I WAS OUT OF TUNE WITH THE BAND AND I HAD TO PRETEND. I HAD TO PRETEND THAT I MIMEED MY WHOLE WAY THROUGH THE SHOW LIKE THIS. AND THEN AFTER A WHILE I GOT FANCY, YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE IN SHOW BUSINESS. >> Stephen: DID YOUR DAD AFTER HE CHANGED HIS LOOK, DID HE EVER LOOK AT YOU AND GO WHY DON'T YOU GET UPDATED, BOY. >> HE WOULD SAY, YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FAMILY. GROW YOUR HAIR. >> Stephen: AND YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS ALSO A MUSICIAN. WAS THERE ANY, DID YOU HAVE ANY-- DID YOU EVER CONSIDER BRINGING SHAME ON YOUR FAMILY BY GOING INTO ACCOUNT ANSI OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> I DID WORK IN A BANK. >> Stephen: DID YOU REALLY? I DESCRIBED IN THE BOOK HOW I WORKED IN A BANK FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THE MANAGER ON THE FIRST DAY THERE COULD SEE I WAS NAIVE ABOUT THE JOB AND HE SAID TAKE THIS, AND STAND OUTSIDE THE BANK. I SAID WHAT IS IT. AND I OPENED-- HE OPENED HIS HAND AND IT WAS A WHISTLE AND I SAID WHAT IS THIS FOR. HE SAID JUST IN CASE. I SAID JUST IN CASE OF WHAT? JUST IN CASE OF A ROBBERY. AND I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT, WELL, I LOVE MY JOB IN THE BANK. BUT WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT FIRST? PROBABLY THE GUY WITH THE WHISTLE. >> Stephen: EXACTLY. I QUIT THAT AND GOT INTO COMPUTERS. >> THAT'S TRUE AS WELL. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. YOU HAVE TO READ THE BOOK.
