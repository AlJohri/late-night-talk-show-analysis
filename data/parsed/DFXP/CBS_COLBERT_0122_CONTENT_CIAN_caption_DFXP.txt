TITUSS BURGESS. AND KEN BURNS! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, THANK YOU, JON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THANKS SO MUCH. WELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HOW ABOUT IT FOR JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. SAY HI TO THE BAND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Jon: YES! >> Stephen: IT HAS BEEN, IT HAS BEEN A CRAZY WEEK FOR THE ELECTION. HUGE UPSETS IN WISCONSIN. COULD SPELL DELEGATE TROUBLE FOR CLINTON AND TRUMP. BOTH PARTIES MIGHT BE HEADED TO CONTESTED CONVENTIONS. SO LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE BIG NEWS, THERE'S A NEW STAR WARS TRAILER! THAT'S RIGHT. THE FIRST PREVIEW FOR "STAR WARS: ROGUE ONE" DROPPED THIS MORNING. AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO SAY IT. IT IS "STAR WARS"! AND I MEAN THAT IN THE MOST WAY POSSIBLE, IT'S GOT EVERYTHING. STORMTROOPERS, IMPERIAL WALKERS, THAT DROID THAT'S JUST A BOX WITH LEGS. IT'S GOT THE "STAR WARS" LOGO, PEOPLE STANDING IN HALLWAYS WITH FLORESCENT LIGHTING AND OF COURSE THE DEATH STAR WHICH THE EMPIRE JUST CAN'T STOP BUILDING FOR SOME REASON. NOW THE MOVIE COMES OUT IN DECEMBER AND I CANNOT WAIT. MY ONLY ISSUE IS SHOULDN'T I HAVE TO WAIT? I'M USED TO WAITING TEN YEARS FOR A NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE, 20 FOR A GOOD ONE. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M GOING TO BE THERE SEE IT OPENING WEEKEND JUST LIKE I WILL FOR EPISODE 8, THE YOUNG HANS SALO MOVIE,EP SIDE NINE, THE BOBA FETT AND THE VH-1 BEHIND THE MUSIC CANTINA BAND. I'M JUST HAPPY THEY PUT THE WORD ONE IN THE NEW TITLE, THAT WAY WE KNOW THERE WILL BE SEQUELS AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SIXTH, ROGUE ONE TWO EPISODE THREE. ANYWAY, WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT. OH YEAH, LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, THE 2016 ELECTION IS FINALLY STARTING TO TAKE SHAPE. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT SHAPE IS KIND OF LUMPY. THIS IS THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE. >> KNOCK THE CRAP OUT OF HIM, WOULD YOU? >> Stephen: ON TUESDAY NIGHT TED CRUZ SCORED A HUGE WIN IN THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY. WHICH HAS GIVEN HIM PLENTY OF REASON TO-- I'M GOING TO SAY SMILE? BUT SURE, BUT HIS TED-MENTUM MIGHT BE SHORT LIVED BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGN HAS MOVED TO NEW YORK WHERE CRUZ HAS GOTTEN IN TROUBLE FOR CRITICIZING NEW YORK VALUES. SO HERE'S HOW CRUZ WAS GREETED BY THIS MORNING'S NEW YORK DAILY NEWS. TAKE THE BLEEP TRAIN TED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW FOR YOU NONNEW YORKERS, THE F [BLEEP] TRAIN SAY PROMINENT LINE HERE IN THE CITY. WE FREAKILY TELL OUT OF TOWNERS TO TAKE IT. OF COURSE IT ONLY HAS ONE STOP, AND ITS YA MUTHER'S HOUSE. BUT EVEN IF NEW YORKERS AREN'T RALLYING BEHIND TED CRUZ HE'S STILL RACKING UP ENDORSEMENTS RIGHT AND FURTHER RIGHT. YESTERDAY IDAHO SENATOR AND INAPPROPRIATELY CHIPPER FUNERAL DIRECTOR JIM RISCH WAS ASKED WHO HE SUPPORTS FOR PRESIDENT. >> I KNOW YOU HAD ENDORSED MARCO RUBIO. THAT DIDN'T EXACTLY WORK OUT. WHO ARE YOU ENDORSING NOW? >> WELL, I REALLY HAVEN'T ENDORSED ANYONE. >> ARE YOU NOT GOING TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. >> I AM NOT GOING TO SUPPORT. >> WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TWO? >> WELL, I WOULD, OBVIOUSLY, KASICH IS SO FAR BEHIND, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE REALLY FOR HIM TO GET THE NUMBERS. SO BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION, THAT GETS YOU TED CRUZ. >> SO YOU WANT TED CRUZ TO GET THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. >> AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO CHOICE. >> Stephen: YES. YES, AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO CHOICE. IT'S THAT KIND OF PASSION THAT INSPIRED THE NEW CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, TED CRUZ, ABANDON ALL HOPE. BUT-- (APPLAUSE) THE IMPORTANT THING IS SENATOR RISCH IS ALL IN! >> SO FAR YOU ARE ONLY, I THINK BY OUR COUNT, THE THIRD SENATOR, REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO WOULD NOW EFFECTIVELY ON THIS PROGRAM HAS COME OUT AND ENDORSED CRUZ. LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MIKE LEE YOUR COLLEAGUES, THEY HAVE. BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN. >> DID I JIS ENDORSE? >> YOU SORT OF SAID YOU PREFER HIM OVER THE OTHER TWO. >> I DO. >> THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN ENDORSEMENT, DOESN'T IT? >> I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION. >> Stephen: YEAH, IT DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITION. ENDORSEMENT PLEENS THROWING UP IN YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT? THAT ENDORSEMENT IS GOING TO STAY WITH ME FOR AWHILE. SO TED CRUZ IS PILING UP DELEGATES AND GAMING ON DONALD TRUMP. WE MIGHT BE ON OUR WAY TO WHAT IS CALLED A CONTESTED CONVENTION. THAT'S WHEN NO CANDIDATE HOLDS A DECISIVE MAJORITY OF THE DELEGATES SO THE NOMINEE IS CHOSEN THROUGH WHEELING AND DEALING, OR ON RARE OCCASIONS, A HOT BUNS COMPETITION. HOW DO YOU THINK NIXON GOT THE NOMINATION IN 68EE? BUT OH, DADDY LIKE. HERE, HERE'S WHERE IT GETS SUPERCRAZY THE GOP COULD NOMINATE SOMEONE WHO DID NOT EVEN RUN THIS YEAR. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DID NOT RUN THIS YEAR NOW SOME NAMES, SOME NAMES-- GOOD MEN, SOME NAMES HAVE ALREADY BEEN FLOATED LIKE PAUL RYAN, MITT ROMNEY, AND MITT ROMNEY. I KNOW I JUST SAID HIM, BUT PEOPLE FORGET HIM SO QUICKLY. NOW IN AN ACT OF DES OPERATION, WHO KNOWS WHO THE GOP WILL NOMINATE. COULD BE SCROOGE McDUCK, A OUIJA BOARD THAT SPELLS OUT RONALD REAGAN, A BALD EAGLE WEARING A PAIR OF PLEATED KHAKIS. OF COURSE, NO MATTER WHO THE NOMINEE IS, THEY'LL BE RUNNING AGAINST WASHINGTON D.C., ESPECIALLY THE DO NOTHING CONGRESS IN WASHINGTON WHO SHOCKINGLY MIGHT BE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING. TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE PETE SESSIONS HAS INTRODUCED H-R642, A BILL RECOGNIZING MAGIC AS A RARE AND VALUABLE ART FORM AND NATIONAL TREASURE. THAT'S RIGHT. CONGRESS MIGHT ACTUALLY PASS SOMETHING. AND ALL IT TOOK WAS. >> MAGIC! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JOIN ME NOW, JOIN ME NOW. >> MAGIC. >> JOIN ME NOW ON A JOURNEY TO THE MYSTERIOUS REALM KNOWN AS THE U.S. CONGRESS. BEAR WITNESS TO THIS AMAZING MAGICAL BILL WHICH WAS COSIGNED BY NOT ONE, NOT TWO BUT SIX OTHER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN WHO ARE HARD AT WORK PASSING OFFICIAL LEGISLATION TO RECOGNIZE THAT MAGIC ENABLES PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE IMPOSSIBLE. MAGIC IS AN ART THAT TRANSFORMS THE ORDINARY INTO THE EXTRAORDINARY, AND MOST OF ALL, THAT MAGIC IS TIMELESS IN APPEAL AND REQUIRES ONLY THE CAPACITY TO DREAM. IT'S PRIORITIES LIKE THESE THAT HAVE MADE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL RATINGS DISAPPEAR. AND-- (APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT WILL NEVER DISAPPEAR, THIS GLITTER FROM MY SET. AND SESSIONS PULLED OFF THIS ASTOUNDING FEAT BY TEAMING UP WITH NONE OTHER THAN DAVID COPPERFIELD HIMSELF TO CRAFT THE RESOLUTION. THAT'S RIGHT, HE DIDN'T JUST GET HELP FROM A MAGICIAN, HE GOT HELP FROM THE MAGICIAN THAT YOU CAN THINK OF. SO NOW ALL YOU SCEPTICS OUT THERE THINK CONGRESS IS DOING NOG ABOUT AMERICA'S PROBLEMS. DON'T WORRY ABOUT STOPPING THE LOSS OF MANUFACTURING JOBS, BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO BECOME THE WORLD'S LEADING PRODUCER OF SILK SCARVES. YES, OH YES. IT'S NOT OVER YET, NO. YES. WA. AND WATCH ME SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT. ORDINARY PACK OF CARDS. ALL RIGHT, I WANT YOU TO THINK OF AN IMMIGRANT. OKAY, DON'T TELL ME WHO IT IS. JUST THINK OF AN IMMIGRANT, IS THIS HIS GREEN CARD? AND WHAT'S THAT. MINIMUM WAGE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU TO LIVE ON? OH, BUT I BELIEVE YOU JUST GOT A RAISE FROM BEHIND YOUR EAR. YEAH. AND MO WHO NEEDS FOOD STAMPS WHEN YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF FOOD IN THE FORM OF RABBITS. THIS IS MY BEAUTIFUL ASSISTANT. HER NAME IS PROTEIN. SHE'S A GREAT SOURCE OF WONDER. AND PROTEIN. BUT DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT GOING TO COOK HER WITHOUT SERVING SOME GARNISH! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MINUTEDE KALING. (APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

OVER THE BREAK WERE YOU KIND BETWEEN THE TWO SHOWS, TO ASK ME TO BE ON THE MINDY PROJECT. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST FUNS I HAD HAD ON ANY SET EVERYWHERE. >> I'M GLAD YOU HAD FUN. >> Stephen: THANK YOU. >> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT UP BECAUSE I WASN'T GOING TO. >> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? >> I'M VERY FOND OF YOU, OKAY. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW I'M FOND OF YOU. >> I DID NOT THINK YOU WERE VERY PROFESSIONAL WHEN YOU CAME ON THE SHOW. >> Stephen: I WAS BETWEEN GIGSK I WAS BETWEEN GIGS, I WAS FOOT LOOSE AND FANCY FREE. >> YEAH, AND I LOVED THE BEARD. >> Stephen: THE KOL-BEARD. >> I THOUGHT IT WAS COOLK I THOUGHT THE NICKNAME WAS KL. >> Stephen: I MADE THE COVER OF HOMELESS SEA CAPTAIN MONTHLY. >> YOU KNOW, YOU CAME ON THE SHOW AND YOU WERE PLAYING-- . >> Stephen: FATHER MICHAEL O'DONNELL. >> KIND OF A SERIOUS GUY AND WE HAD A SCENE WHERE YOU HAD TO GIVE A EULOGY OVER THE DEATH OF ANOTHER MINISTER-- ANOTHER PRIEST. AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU DIDN'T HANDLE IT THAT WELL. IT'S A VERY SOMBER-- I THINK WE HAVE-- I THINK I BROUGHT FROM CALIFORNIA. >> Stephen: ALL THE WAY FROM CALIFORNIA. >> I CARRIED THE FILE WITH ME HERE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> Stephen: SO COULD WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHATEVER MINDY BROUGHT. >> IS THAT OKAY. >> Stephen: LET'S BOW OUR HEAD FORCE ONE FINAL PRAY FOR FATHER FRANCIS. I KNOW SOME OF YOU CALLED HIM QUOTE A DECREPIT BAG OF BONES OR A BORING WIZARD. I PROMISE I'LL GET-- I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU CALLED HIM, QUOTE, A DECREPIT BAG OF BONES-- I WANT TO GET IT SO BAD. I KNOW SOME OF YOU CALLED-- I KNOW THAT SOME OF YOU CALLED HIM-- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO ANYTHING. WHAT IS THE QUESTION AGAIN? A QUOTE-- (LAUGHTER). >> Stephen: WAIT A SECOND. IF YOU ARE BALD-- IF YOU ARE FAULT, IT'S YOUR DAMN SCRIPT. >> IT WAS SO FUNNY THAT YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT. >> Stephen: I-- WELL, LISTEN, YOU WERE THE WEREN'T THE MOST PROFESSIONAL PERSON EITHER. >> WHAT? >> Stephen: NO, IT IS YOUR DAMN SHOW AND YOU WEREN'T THE MOST PRESKSOL-- PROFESSIONAL EITHER. BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE CLIP WAS MY OWN. WE DID A SCENE WHERE I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE DANNY'S GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A CATHOLIC. >> OH YEAH. >> Stephen: I COME OVER TO THE HOUSE AS A PRIEST BECAUSE I'M A FRIEND OF DANNYS FROM BACK IN THE DAY. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: AND I'M TALKING ABOUT A GIRL THAT HE SUPPOSEDLY IS DATING THAT'S NOT A CATHOLIC WHO I DON'T KNOW IS YOU. >> RIGHT, RIGHT. >> Stephen: AND THEN THIS IS YOUR REACTION, IT'S NOT IN THE SCRIPT HOW YOU REACT. >> HAVE I NO RECOLLECTION. >> Stephen: I AM DESCRIBING YOU WITHOUT YOU KNOWING IT AND THIS IS YOUR REACTION UNPROFESSIONALLY. >> I ACTUALLY KNEW DANNY BACK THEN. SHE WASN'T CRAZY. SHE HAD A HUGE RACK. >> Stephen: REALLY? I HEARD SHE WAS PEAR SHAPED WITH SMALL BREASTS. >> OKAY, WHAT THE HELL? >> Stephen: HEY, GET OFF ME, DON'T PUNCH ME LIKE THAT. >> I'M SORRY, FATHER, DO YOU KNOW-- . >> Stephen: AT NO POINT, AT NO PLACE IN THE SCRIPT DOES IT SAY MINDY SCRATCHES THE PRIEST'S EYES OUT. >> YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ATTACK YOUR COSTARS ON MY SHOW, YEAH. >> Stephen: NO. COULD I ASK YOU SOMETHING. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: YOU CAST ME AS A PRIEST IN THIS. WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT? >> WELL, I KNEW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN READ-- IN READING ABOUT YOU, THAT YOU WERE KIND OF-- YOU KNOW. >> Stephen: A CATHOLIC. >> YEAH. >> AND YOU TAKE IT I THINK PRETTY SERIOUSLY AND YOUR FACE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. >> Stephen: YEAH, SURE. >> AN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO TAKE THAT AND THEN JUST GO LIKE-- AND MAKE YOU DO STUFF THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO YOUR OWN CHURCH AND SAY TO YOUR OWN PRIEST, I'M SO SORRY. >> Stephen: I WAS ACTUALLY FRIGHTENED OF MY OWN PRIEST AFTER DOING THIS. BECAUSE HE HAS GOT A CHECK ERRED PAST, THE PRIEST YOU CAST ME AS. >> THE CHARACTER HE PLAYED ON MY SHOW WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD, I THINK YOU SAID, QUOTE, HAD DONE EVERY DRUG KNOWN TO MAN IN EVERY OPENING IN YOUR BODY. IT WAS LIKE-- AND HE HAD SLEPT WITH LOTS OF FAMOUS WOMEN. >> Stephen: YEAH, LOOK I'M A MAN OF GOD BUT BACK IN THE DAY I GOT MORE TAIL THAN A TOILET SEAT. >> WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE FUN FOR YOU TO DO. >> Stephen: NOW WE'RE IN THE MINDY PROJECT WHICH IS ON HULU AND SECOND HALF OF SEASON FOUR STARTS APRIL 12th. DID YOU AN UNUSUAL THING. YOU HAD A MID SEASON CLIFF HANGER. >> UH-HUH. >> Stephen: SO FEW SHOWS DO THAT. WHERE YOU'VE GOT A BABY NOW. AND DANNY MIGHT BE LEAVING YOU, OKAY. YOU DON'T KNOW, OKAY. YOU'RE NOT A MOM YOURSELF BUT DO YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM BEING A MOM ON SET? LIKE FROM THE BABY? CUZ IT'S A REAL BABY. >> REAL BABY. I LEARNED THAT BABIES DO NOT LIKE BEING HELD BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THEIR MOTHER A LOT OF THE TIMES. >> Stephen: IT'S TRUE. >> AND THEY WILL SCREAM AND CRY IN YOUR ARMS. >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> ALSO YOU CAN'T REASON WITH A BABY, CHILL OUT, MAN. I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. DOES IT MAKE YOU WANT TO HAVE ONE? >> YOU KNOW, I DID FEEL BETWEEN THE CRYING IN MY ARMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, I DO SHALL-- I'M AT THAT AGE WHERE I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE. I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING I WAS VERY ATTACHED TO MY OWN MOM AND I THINK THAT THAT SOMETIMES MAKES ME FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD BE A NICE RELATIONSHIP TO REPLICATE DOWNWARDS. >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. YOUR CHARACTER IS NAMED MINDY AND YOUR NAME IS MINDY. DO PEOPLE EVER HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE THINGS THAT YOUR CHARACTER DOES. >> YES. AND YOU KNOW WE MIGHT HAVE THAT IN COMMON A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE MI CHARACTER DOES A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF. >> Stephen: SHE'S WONDERFULLY SELFISH. >> AND SHE-- THERE IS A LOT OF REALLY POLARIZING STANCES ON THINGS. >> Stephen: WITHOUT DOES YOUR CHARACTER WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. >> OH, DONALD TRUMP. BUT I WANTED DONALD TRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT, A HARD LINE DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTER BUT SINCE LIKE 2008. >> Stephen: WOW. >> HAS WRITTEN HIM IN. >> Stephen: WHAT DOES SHE LIKE ABOUT HIM? >> THAT HE WAS THE STAR OF A REALITY SHOW AND THAT SHE AND HIM BOTH DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN HAIR. THAT THEY BOTH HAVE FAKE HAIR. AND I THINK SHE LIKES PEOPLE THAT MAKE BIG PROCLAMATIONS. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. >> AND JUST SORT OF FOLLOW IT UP LATER. >> Stephen: I THINK PEOPLE-- ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE YOUR CHARACTER, A LOT OF THE REASONS A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE YOUR CHARACTER IS THAT WE GET TO BE VY CARIOUSLY SELFISH THROUGH YOU. BECAUSE YOUR CHARACTER DOES AND SAYS WHAT SHE WANTS. AND THEN ASSUMES THAT EVERYONE WILL JUST GO ALONG WITH IT. >> AND SHE SAID THINGS, SHE SAID ONCE RECENTLY, CHRIS JENNER'S WOMB WAS A NATIONAL TREASURE. AND SHE SAYS THAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE RECYCLING BECAUSE IT MAKES AMERICA LOOK POOR. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SHE SAYS STUFF THAT, IT'S MUCH MORE-- MOST PARTS FOR WOMEN, THE ONLY CHARACTERISTIC FOR MOST LEADS IN MOST SITCOMS IS JUST THAT THEY ARE LIKE HOT AND NICE. SO-- . >> Stephen: YEAH. >> IT'S A NICE THING TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS PART. >> Stephen: TO BE HOT AND SELFISH. >> TO BE HOT AND SELFISH, THANK YOU. YES. >> Stephen: WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

I LOVE MY COUNTRY. I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO LOVES THEIR COUNTRY MORE THAN I DO. SOMEBODY COULD BE EQUAL BUT THE LAST TIME I TOOK A CLASS IN AMERICAN HISTORY WAS IN THE 11th GRADE WHEN THEY HOLD A GUN TO YOUR HEAD AND MAKE YOU TAKE IT BUT I LOVED IT. AND HAVE I BEEN DOING IT FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS. >> Stephen: I THINK YOU ARE THE FATHER OF BINGE WATCHING BECAUSE YOU HAVE THINGS THAT ARE 12 HOURS AND 18 HOURS, YOU KNOW, LONG. OR 18 EPISODES AND PEOPLE-- WILL WAMP ALL OF THEM IN A WEEK END. I LOVE THE ROOSEVELTS, IS THERE A COMMON THEME THROUGHOUT ALL YOUR WORK? >> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT AMERICAN QUESTION OF FREEDOM, THE TENSION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND COLLECTIVE FREEDOM SAY BIG ONE. BUT FOR ME I THINK THE SUB THEME OF AMERICAN HISTORY IS RACE. WE WERE FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT ALL MEN WERE CREATED EQUAL AM BUT THE GUY WHO WROTE THAT OWNED MORE THAN A HUNDRED HUMAN BEINGS AND DIDN'T SEE FIT IN HIS LIFETIME TO FREE ANY ONE OF THEM. DIDN'T SEE THE CONTRADICTION OF THE HYPOCRISY. SO IT SET US ON A JOURNEY THAT IS CONSTANTLY HAVING TO STRUGGLE NOT ONLY WITH RACE BUT RACISM. LOOK WHAT IS GOING ON NOW. WE HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO TAKES TWO DAYS TO WINK WINK, REMEMBER TO DISAVOW AN ASSOCIATION WITH DAVID DUKE OF KU KLUX KLAN AND THAT, YOU KNOW, TELLING YOU HOW MUCH IS STILL THERE. >> Stephen: WELL, THE NEW DOCUMENTARY IS JACKIE ROBINSON. (APPLAUSE) IT'S ABOUT JACKIE ROBINSON WHO WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN BASEBALL PLAYER IN THE WHITE A MAJOR LEAGUES. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: IT WAS ALREADY THE NEGLECT RO LEAGUES. WHY IS JACKIE ROBINSON'S STORY AN IMPORTANT ONE TO TELL. >> THIS FILM THAT WE JUST FINISHED T SAY SMALL FIM, TWO PART, FOUR HOUR, NOT THE BIG LONG ONE, IT WILL BE OUT MONDAY AND TUESDAY I MADE WITH SARAH BURNS AND DAVID McMA HON AND THEY DESEARCH EQUAL CREDIT. THEY ARE COPRODUCERS AND CODIRECTORS. WE TREATED HIM IN OUR 1994 BASEBALL SERIES AND IT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT SERIES. BUT JACKIE ROBINSON, LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON, ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS SMOTHERED IN MYTHOLOGY. WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO LIBERATE HIM FROM THE SENTIMENTALITY THAT ATTACH AND TRY TO FREE HIM BECAUSE WHAT JACKIE HAS TO TEACH US NOW IS ALMOST WHAT IS GOING ON. THE BIBLE SAY THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN. THAT MEANS HUMAN NATURE DOESN'T CHANGE. IT JUST SUPERIMPOSES IT SELF ON THESE RANDOM CHAOS OF THE EVENTS OR SEEMINGLY RANDOM CHAOS OF THE EVENTS. SO JACKIE IS TALKING ABOUT CON FED RATE PLAQUE FLAGS, TALKING ABOUT DRIVING STOPPED WHILE DRIVING, TALKING ESSENTIALLY ABOUT BLACK LIVES MATTER, SO IF WE ARE CURIOUS BUT ARE NOT COMFORTABLE TALKING TODAY HAVING A COURAGEOUS KRVETION ABOUT RACE, LET'S LOOK AT JACKIE ROBINSON'S LIFE AND SEE HOW MANY OF THE SAME TROPES THAT ARE PART OF OUR LIFE TODAY ON TODAY'S HEADLINES JACKIE ADDRESSES. AND THEN YOU REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THE ACTION IS. THE MOST PORPT PERSON IN BASEBALL, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN AMERICAN SPORT. >> Stephen: AND A GREAT PLAYER. >> HALL OF FAME. NO, NO, YOU COULD ARGUE THAT HE IS NOT THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER BUT HE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON WHO HAS THEIR NUMBER RETIRE   TIRED IN ALL 30 STADIUMS. NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO WEAR THE NUMBER 42 EXCEPT A WEEK FROM FRIDAY WHEN EVERYONE FROM THE BAT BOY TO THE MANAGER TO THE STAR PITCHER, THE GUY SITTING ON THE BENCH ON BOTH TEAMS IN EVERY STADIUM IN EVERY GAME THEY WEAR THE NUMBER 42 BECAUSE HE DIDN'T IN THIS MEDIA CULTURE, DIDN'T JUST TALK THE TALK. HE WALKED THE WALK. AND EF REEF DAY HE GOT UP AND SAID I WISH TO MAKE THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE BETTER. AND THAT IS, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TELL A MORE COMPLETE STORY WITH SARAH BURNS AND MAIK McMA HON AND I WANTED TO DO IS ONCE YOU STRIPPED IT OF THE SENTIMENTALITY AND NOSTALGIA YOU HAVE A COMPLICATED DIMENSIONAL PERSON. >> Stephen: YOU WERE ABLE TO TALK TO HIS WIFE BECAUSE SHE IS STILL ALIVE. >> RACHEL ROBINSON IS ALMOST 94. SHE HAS ALL OF HER MASH EMS AND SOME OF MINE AND I WANT THEM BACK. AND SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST-- . >> Stephen: PART OF HIS GREATNESS. >> I DON'T THINK. SHE IS CENTRAL TO IT I MEAN WE HAD THE GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO CERTIFICATE VIEW THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY AND YOU REALIZE THEY WERE TWO COUPLES HURDLING THROUGH DIFFERENT TIMES AND SPACES BUT THIS IS A BLACK MAN WHO WENT THROUGH A DOOR THAT NO OTHER BLACK HAND HAD GONE THROUGH BEFORE. >> Stephen: WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP OF THAT RIGHT NOW. JIM. >> MR.. >> TO MONTREAL TO SEE JACKIE AND HIS FIRST YEAR IN THE MINORS. AND HE HAPPENED TO SIT IN AN AREA WHERE THE WIFES WERE. RACHEL WAS IN WILL GROUP. WHEN BUZZIE SAW HER, LISTENED IT HER AND REALIZED SHE HERSELF WAS A COLLEGE GRADUATE AND VERY INTELLIGENT, VERY CLASSY PERSON, HE WENT BACK AND SAID TO MR. RICKY, IF JACKIE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PICK HER FOR HIS WIFE, HE'S THE GUY YOU WANT. >> THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY, THAN A REAL PARTNERSHIP. WHICH IS PROBABLY WHAT MADE HIM SUCH A GREAT MAN. BECAUSE HE HAD THE JUDGEMENT TO FIND A PARTNER THAT, I THINK THAT IS TRUE. I THINK THAT IS A SIGN OF HIS CHARACTER, THAT HE CHOSE A WOMAN THAT WAS HIS EQUAL. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE HAD JACKIE ROBINSON WITHOUT RACHEL. >> Stephen: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. >> IT'S BEAUTIFUL. >> Stephen: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: IT'S REAL. >> IT IS COMPLETELY REAL. THEY'RE SO-- THIS MAY BE THE MOST POWERFUL COUPLE ON EARTH BUT THEY'RE SO HONEST AND TRANSPARENT AND THERE'S NOT A COUPLE ON EARTH THAT DOESN'T GO, YOU KNOW THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU HAVE TO SAY, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, DEAR. >> YES, DEAR. >> Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. JACKIE ROBINSON APPEARS APRIL 11th ON PBS. KEN BURNS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. S THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY. GOOD NIGHT.
