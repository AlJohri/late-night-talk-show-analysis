THANK SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU! THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" STARRING STEPHEN COLBERT. I AM HE. I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL SITTING DOWN BECAUSE I HAVE SOME DISTURBING NEWS TO REPORT ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT. I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS. BUT I WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HIS INABILITY TO KEEP TRACK OF THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN BLOODTHIRSTY LEADERS IN THE UNSTABLE REGION OF WESTEROS. ( LAUGHTER ) IN AN INTERVIEW IN "G.Q.," PRESIDENT OBAMA CLAIMS HE LOVES "GAME OF THRONES," BUT HE HAS TROUBLE REMEMBERING THE NAMES OF ANY OF THE CHARACTERS. IN FACT-- THIS IS TRUE-- WHEN THEY ASKED HIM HIS FAVORITE CHARACTER HE SAID-- AND I QUOTE-- "MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IS PROBABLY THE DWARF. WHAT'S HIS NAME?" WHAT'S HIS NAME, MR. PRESIDENT! HIS NAME IS TYRION LANNISTER, OF THE HOUSE LANNISTER. YOUNGEST SON OF LORD TYWIN LANNISTER, ONE-TIME RICHEST MAN IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS AND LORD PARAMOUNT OF THE WESTERLANDS. I THOUGHT YOU FOLLOWED POLITICS, SIR! IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I MEAN, HOW YOU CAN SURVIVE IN THE GEOPOLITICAL CHESS GAME IF YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYRION OF HOUSE LANNISTER, AND, SAY, JORAH MORMONT, SON OF JEOR MORMONT OF HOUSE MORMONT, LORDS OF BEAR ISLAND AND THE VASSALS OF HOUSE STARK IN THE NORTH? YOU'RE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL, MR. PRESIDENT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL! YOU'RE TELLING US YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER HODOR'S NAME? WELL, I GUESS THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE, HE ONLY SAYS IT 50 TIMES PER EPISODE. BUT PERHAPS MOST DAMNING WAS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID NEXT, AND AGAIN I QUOTE: "THE ONLY ONE I REMEMBER IS JON SNOW, BECAUSE I CAN PRONOUNCE JON SNOW." ( LAUGHTER ) SIR, SIR, THAT IS ADDING INSULT TO JON SNOW'S FATAL INJURY. OH, SORRY, SPOILER ALERT. SO I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU START WATCHING A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY, MR. PRESIDENT. WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU TO BRING PEACE TO THE SEVEN KINGDOMS. AND BESIDES, NOBODY IN ALL OF "GAME OF THRONES" HAS A STRANGER NAME THAN BARACK OBAMA. COME ON! SORRY. I'M MAD. ANYWAY, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. I'LL BE TALKING WITH AWARD-WINNING ACTOR SHARON STONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WONDERFUL, VERY TALENTED. SHE STARS IN THE NEW TNT SHOW "AGENT X" AS THE VICE PRESIDENT. SHE'S LIKE A CHARMING, SEXY JOE BIDEN. SO... JOE BIDEN. ( LAUGHTER ) I'LL ALSO BE SITTING DOWN WITH JUSTIN THEROUX, STAR OF HBO'S "THE LEFTOVERS." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ON HBO. I WONDER IF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAVORITE CHARACTER "THE DWARF" IS IN THIS ONE, TOO. I'M SORRY, I CAN'T LET IT GO. AND WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM FIVE-TIME GRAMMY AWARD WINNER JAMES TAYLOR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY-- EVERYBODY LOVES JAMES TAYLOR. OR, AS SUPERFANS CALL HIM, "TAY-TAY." ♪ ♪ ♪ THAT SOUND RIGHT THERE IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY!

YOU KNOW, I KNOW-- I KNOW YOU'RE HERE TO GET A SHOW FROM US BUT I NEED THE ENERGY FROM YOU. YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S BEEN A TOUGH WEEK FOR THE WORLD. AND IN TIMES LIKE THESE, I LIKE SHARING SOME GOOD NEWS. BUT INSTEAD I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) HIS SUPPORT KEEPS GROWING, WITH THE LATEST POLL FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE SHOWING HIM AHEAD BY 22 POINTS. 22. THAT'S HIGHER THAN THE AGE OF HIS NEXT WIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) THESE MEN AND WOMEN KNOW THAT IN THE END, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE. WE ALL LOVE WATCHING THE HORSE RACE, AND MOST OF THESE PEOPLE LIKE A HORSE, WILL BE TURNED INTO GLUE BECAUSE POLITICS IS A BLOODSPORT. IT'S LIKE "THE HUNGER GAMES." NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." HA, HA! YES! OH! GREETINGS! YES! YES! TRIBUTES, ASSEMBLE! AH, LOOK AT THEM. LOOK AT THEM! OH, YES. SMILES AS TIGHT AS A SNARE DRUM. SO FULL OF PROMISE AND IOWA CORN DOGS. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT ONCE AGAIN, CITIZENS, A VALIANT CAMPAIGN WARRIOR HAS GONE TO THAT GREAT PANCAKE BREAKFAST IN THE SKY. >> BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. REPUBLICAN BOBBY JINDAL, THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA, IS DROPPING OUT. JINDAL NEVER GOT OUT OF SINGLE DIGITS IN THE POLLS. >> MY PARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY 45 YEARS AGO. THEY TOLD ME AS A YOUNG CHILD THAT AMERICANS CAN DO ANYTHING. I BELIEVED THEM THEN. OH, SO SAD. NOT ONLY DID JINDAL HAVE TO DROP OUT, HE LEARNED HIS PARENTS HAVE BEEN LYING TO HIM. BOBBY, I HAVE SOME TERRIBLE NEWS ABOUT THE TOOTH FAIRY. SHE'S NOT VOTING FOR YOU, EITHER. HA! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MMMM! ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE STARTED WITH SUCH PROMISE. THIS TRIBUTE'S STAR HAS BEEN RISING EVER SINCE 2013, WHEN HE SHARED HIS VISION FOR TRANSFORMING HIS BELOVED REPUBLICAN PARTY. >> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T NEED TO CHANGE OUR PRINCIPLE, BUT WE MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE WE ARE DOING. WE HAVE TO STOP BEING THE STUPID PARTY. IT'S NO SECRET WE HAD A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS DAMAGE THE BRAND THIS YEAR WITH OFFENSIVE AND BIZARRE COMMENTS. I'M HERE TO SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT. >> Stephen: APPARENTLY NOT ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE "OFFENSIVE AND BIZARRE" ARE IN FIRST AND SECOND PLACE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YES, GENTLEMEN! YES. BRAVO! BRAVO, BAWFO, GENTLEMEN, OH, YES. BUT IT HAS BEEN QUITE AN ADVENTURE SO FAR FOR JINDAL. WHO CAN FORGET THE MOMENT WHEN HE ANNOUNCED HIS CAMPAIGN WITH A VIDEO RECORDED FROM BEHIND A TREE LIMB? THIS IS THE CLOSEST HE'LL EVER GET TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH! HA, HA! RARRR. I'M A SHARK. RARRR. BUT ONCE HE HAD ENTERED THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES, THE GOVERNOR PROVED TO BE VERY RELATABLE BECAUSE MUCH LIKE THE VOTERS HE WAS OBSESSE OBSESSED WITH DONALD TRUMP. >> HERE IS THE TRUTH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP IS SHALLOW. THERE'S NO IDEOLOGY. THERE'S NO POLICY. THERE'S NO INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY. HE'S ONLY FOR HIMSELF. THE IDEA OF DONALD TRUMP'S GREAT. THE REALITY IS AWFUL. >> Stephen: I CAN SEE WHY VOTERS WERE TURNED OFF BY BOBBY JINDAL. THAT TREE BRANCH IS LESS WOODEN THAN HE IS. HA, HA. WORD PLAY. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS MUST BE TOUGH NEWS FOR JINDAL'S BASE, OR WHATEVER YOU CALL POLLING AT 0.3%. 0.3%. NOW, TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS-- DOESN'T MATTER. THIS IS A POP TART.

I HAVE OLD MAN ANKLES. I DON'T WANT TO PEOPLE TO SEE THAT. >> IT'S KIND OF LIKE TRUCKERS' ARM WITH THE TAN. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE A THREE-DECADE-LONG CAREER NOW, AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO, YOU KNOW, BE FAZED AT ALL BY WHAT HAS BEEN HOLLYWOOD'S TRADITIONAL, SAY, NOT MOST WARM EMBRACES ACTRESSES AS THEY REACH THEIR 50s.

THE FIRST DAY THE VICE PRESIDENT COMES INTO OFFICE IN "AGENT X." >> I THINK WHAT HAPPENS TO ANYONE WHO BECOMES PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT IS THEY'RE PRETTY SURPRISED ON DAY ONE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS WHAT IT REALLY IS LIKE. IN THE CASE OF OUR SHOW, THE VICE PRESIDENT FINDS OUT THERE'S A CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT WHICH SAYS THAT-- AND IT IS SO THAT WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENT IS SWORN IN THEY SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE PRESIDENT WHICH IS THAT THEY SWEAR TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY AGAINST ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC. AND IN THIS CASE, SHE DOES THAT BY DISPATCHING A SECRET AGENT. WHO IS SUPER HANDSOME AND CUTE. HE'S A GUY NAMED JEFF HEPHNER, WHO PLAYS OUR AGENT "X." >> Stephen: AND THE CONSTITUTION SAYS BASICALLY YOU HAVE YOUR OWN ONE-MAN HIT SQUAD YOU CAN SEND OUT TO KILL PEOPLE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: DIDN'T DICK CHENEY HAVE THAT ALREADY?

IN THIS WORLD, OUR PRESIDENT WAS A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT. >> Stephen: SO, OF COURSE, HE KNOWS. >> SO HE KNOWS. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT. >> BUT HE CAN'T TALK TO ME ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE'S PRESIDENT. >> Stephen: HE HAS TO PRETEND. >> HE HAS PRESIDENTIAL AMNESIA. YOU KNOW HOW MEN GET THAT? >> Stephen: HERE'S A CLIP FROM THE SHOW AND IT IS I BELIEVE THE AGENT AT THE TIME-- WHAT'S THE AGENT'S NAME. >> AGENT "X," JOHN CASE. >> YOU NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THIS COUNTRY IS IN CRISIS. EVERY LAST ONE OF US. >> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MA'AM, VICE PRESIDENT, I DID NOT COME UP HERE FOR YOU TO CHANGE MY MIND. I CAME UP HERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE. >> I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS JOB, THAT THIS JOB CHOSE YOU, BUT YOU'RE A PATRIOT. RALPH WALDO EMERSON SAID, "A HERO ISN'T BRAVER THAN THE ORDINARY MAN.

DON'T HAVE ONE. DON'T HAVE ONE. >> Stephen: HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET RIGHT? >> WELL, IT TAKES A LONG TIME. YOU HAVE YOUR INITIAL RECOVERY WHERE YOU'RE KIND OF UP AND AROUND AND DOING THE BASIC THINGS. BUT THEN OVER TIME, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS AND THEN LONG-TERM MEMORY LOSS AND SOMETIMES YOU MEET PEOPLE AND THEY SAY, "HEY." AND YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW YOU. AND THEY START TO TELL YOU STORIES AND YOU THINK,"GOD, I'M GLAD I FORGOT." ( LAUGHTER ) SO THERE'S BENEFITS TO IT. BUT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET-- BECAUSE BEFORE THAT I HAD KIND OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY. AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME FOR THAT TO COME BACK.
