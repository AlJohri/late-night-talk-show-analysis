SO WE DIDN'T-- I DON'T KNOW IF WE TALKED THAT MUCH. WE PROBABLY TALKED A LITTLE BIT, LIKE ABOUT ME, AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THEN LATER, ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO, WE MET AGAIN AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY. AND EDIE CAME UP AND SAID, "I REALLY ENJOYED YOUR LAST ALBUM," WHICH WAS A BLUEGRASS ALBUM I DID WITH THE STEVE CANYON RANGERS.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND SHE SAID "WOULD YOU EVER LIKE TO WRITE A SONG TOGETHER?" AND I HAD ONLY WRITTEN SONGS ALONE SO I HAD NO CONCEPT OF HOW TO WRITE A SONG WITH SOMEBODY BUT I SAID, "SURE." AND WE FOLLOWED THROUGH. >> Stephen: NOW, DID YOU KNOW HIM AS A MUSICIAN AT ALL BEFORE THIS? >> NO, I LISTENED TO HIS RECORD ON THE WAY INTO NEW YORK CITY TO THAT PARTY, AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY HIS SONGWRITING AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. AND I HEARD OTHER SINGERS ON THE EXPROARD THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE A FUN THING TO DO. >> SHE WAS THINKING IF I AM HAVING DINNER WITH THIS GUY, I BETTER BRUSH UP ON HIM. >> Stephen: THIS WAS THE STEEP CANYON RANGERS, HIS BANJO PLAYING? >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: DID IT SURPRISE YOU, BECAUSE IT SURPRISES A LOT OF PEOPLE, WHEN YOU HEAR STEVE TO PLAY THE BANJO, YOU KEEP ON WAITING FOR THE JOKE TO HAPPEN. HAS THAT BEEN A PROBLEM, PEOPLE LIKE, "HA-HA, WHEN DOES IT GET FUNNY?" >> SOME OF THE SONGS I WRITE ARE FUNNY BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE SERIOUS. WHEN YOU WRITE MUSIC IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL, BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE MUSIC. AND THEY HATE-- HATE COMEDY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NEVER BEEN A PROBLEM. WE DO OUR SHOW-- I DO A LOT OF SMOKES IN OUR SHOW WITH THE STEEP CANYON RANGERS AND I TRAVEL WITH MARTY SHORT AND DO A LOT OF JOKES THERE AND PLAY TYPICAL-- OH. >> Stephen: THIS IS YOUR LATEST ALBUM TOGETHER. >> WAS I BORING? >> Stephen: WHAT?

HOW DOES THIS WORK? >> YOU TALK. I'VE TALKED QUITE A BIT. >> Stephen: ESPECIALLY IF YOU WRITE THE LYRICS, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK. >> LET ME SAY SOMETHING, SHE'S VERY MODEST BUT SHE WRITES ALL THE LYRICS IN THE SHOW. >> I LOVE IT.

HE'LL SEND ME BANJO TUNES AND THEY'LL HAVE THE PERFECT TONE AND I'LL BE ABLE TO SING'S CHARACTER'S PART. >> Stephen: HOW DO THE LYRICS COME TO YOU? DO YOU LISTEN TO THE MUSIC FIRST AND HAVE IMAGES? WHAT IS THE PROCESS? >> WELL, WITH OUR FIRST RECORD, IT WAS AS IF SOMEBODY TURNED A PROJECTOR ON IN MY MIND. I SAW LITTLE MOVIES AND ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SING THEM OUT. BUT FOR THE MUSIC, OBVIOUSLY, I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF OUR CHARACTERS AND THEIR STORIES AND HOW THEY FEEL. >> Stephen: THE-- THE THING THAT IS SURPRISING TO ME IS THAT YOU-- YOU DON'T WRITE LYRICS TO YOUR SONGS NORMALLY. >> I DO, I DO WRITE LYRICS. BUT IN THE CASE OF THE MUSICAL, EDIE WRITES THE LYRICS AND WE COWROTE THE MUSIC TOGETHER EXCEPT SHE HAS A COUPLE SONGS SHE WROTE BY HERSELF, AND THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD. >> Stephen: THIS IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, A VERY TRAGIC STORY. >> IT'S BASED NOT ON A TRUE STORY BUT A TRUE EVENT. >> Stephen: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO. >> AN EVENT AN INCIDENT BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE FACTS -- LIKE, IF SOMEBODY FALLS OFF A BUILDING, YOU DON'T KNOW-- LIKE I'M GOING TO DO TONIGHT-- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LED UP TO THAT AND WHAT WAS THE AFTERMATH. BUT THE EVENT THAT EDIE DISCOVERED IN THE NEWS FROM 1904 WAS THAT A BABY HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN A SUITCASE THAT HAD BEEN THROWN FROM THE TRAIN-- FROM A TRAIN. >> Stephen: AND THE BABY WAS ALIVE. >> THE BABY LIVED AND WAS RAILED BY A DIFFERENT FAMILY. AND THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY TRUE STORY BUT THEY NEVER FIGURED OUT WHAT HAPPENED. >> Stephen: HOW DID YOU FIND THIS STORY? WHAT LED YOU TO THIS STORY? >> STEVE SENT A BANJO TUNE AND I HEARD MYSELF SINGING, "WOO-OOO. >> I WISH I HAD MY BANJO. >> Stephen: I ALWAYS KEEP A BANJO BACK HERE. IT'S A REALLY NICE ONE. PLEASE BE CAREFUL. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: PLEASE BE CAREFUL. >> I THOUGHT-- I THOUGHT THAT ABOUT YOU, THAT YOU ALWAYS KEPT A BANJO HANDY. >> Stephen: I DON'T PLAY. I JUST KEEP A BANJO BACK HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) IN CASE SOMEBODY RUSHES THE STAGE, I TAKE THEM OUT WITH IT. >> COULD BE A RESULT OF THE COLD MEDICINE. >> Stephen: COULD BE. NONE OF THIS MAY BE HAPPENING. >> I DON'T-- WAKE UP! WAKE UP, STEPHEN! ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW. >> YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE WAS THIS LITTLE BIT. I'LL PLAY IT REALLY QUICKLY. DO YOU MIND? ♪ WOOO-OOO BABY ♪ ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: WOOO, BABY AND THAT LED TO A STORY FOR YOU. >> TELL HOW. >> THIS IS THE FIRST TUNE HE SENT WHERE I DIDN'T GET THAT PROJECTOR SENSE OF IMAGERY. I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A TRAIN TO ME WITH WOO-WOO. I GOOGLED NAMES OF SOUTHERN TRAINS BECAUSE I WANTED TO FIND A REAL TRAIN AND SEE WHERE IT RAN. AND THE FIRST TRAIN THAT CAUGHT MY EYE WAS THE IRON MOUNTAIN. IS AND WHEN YOU CLICK ON THE IRON MOUNTAIN IT OFFERS THIS STORY OF THE IRON MOUNTAIN BABY ABOUT THIS PAEB WHO HAD BEEN THROWN OFF THE OF IRON MOUNTAIN. AND I SAY THE SADE THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY FOR A SONG. PLUS THE WOMAN WHO RAISED THE BABY WAS NAMED SARAH JANE. AND I SAID HER NAME RHYMES WITH TRAIN. THIS HAS GOT TO HAPPEN. >> Stephen: WELL, IT DID, AND IT'S CALLED "BRIGHT STAR" AT THE COURT THEATER. GO SEE IT TOMORROW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE STEVE MARTIN AND EDIE BRICKELL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE HERE WITH STEVE MARTIN AND EDIE BRICKELL. YOU WERE PLAYING ALONG WITH THAT SONG. WHAT IS THAT SONG? >> IT'S VERY INTERESTING YOU WOULD KNOW THIS SONG. YOU'VE BEEN AROUND. THEY WERE PLAYING "ANG LINE THE BAKER" WRITTEN BY STEPHEN FOSTER. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT. YOU KNEW IT. >> Jon: YEAH, WE KNEW THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) >> AND THE ORIGINAL NAME OF THE SONG WAS "ANG LINEA BAKER," AND IT GOT TRANSFORMED INTO "ANG LINE THE BAKER "BECAUSE IT SOUNDING LIKE ANGELINE THE BAKER." >> Stephen: THAT IS AN INTERESTING STORY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: CAN WE GET BACK TO EDIE BRICKELL, PLEASE. >> CAN I HAVE ANOTHER GO AT IT. >> Stephen: EDIE, I LOVE YOUR ACCENT, WHERE ARE YOU FROM? >> TEXAS. >> Stephen: WHERE IN TEXAS AIR, BIG TOWN, SMALL TOWN? >> I SPENT MY LIFE BETWEEN PARIS, TEXAS, AND DALLAS, TEXAS. >> Stephen: THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT TOWNS. >> YES.

AND WE WOULD VISIT-- STEVE ENCOURAGED ME TO TELL THIS STORY, OKAY? I THINK THIS IS A SETUP FOR IT. >> Stephen: WE'LL FIND OUT. LET'S FIND OUT. >> I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH MY GRANDMOTHER, ONE OF 11. AND THE YOUNGEST, AUNT BETTE, SHE WAS A RASCAL. SHE WAS A WILD GIRL. AND SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN AT THIS TIME. AND SHE WAS THERE AND MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS VERY HARD OF HEARING AND LISTEN TO BALLGAMES ON A LITTLE TRANSISTOR RADIO REALLY LOUD AND ONE NIGHT SHE CAME IN AND SAID, "I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE." AND SHE PULLED SOME DUCT TAPE OUT OF THE KITCHEN DRAWER AND TAPED THAT RADIORADIO TO HIS HEAD. >> Stephen: AND THAT WAS THE FIRST WALKMAN. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHEN DID YOU-- DID YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE OFF BEING A MUSICAL STAR? DID YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE DREAMS WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL GROWING UP? >> I DID HAVE DREAMS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WAS REALLY LUCKY. MY MOTHER AND MY FAMILY SAID-- I WOULD SING WHEN I WOULD WALK AROUND THE HOUSE, AND THEY SAID, "YOU'RE A GOOD SINGER." SO I FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO IN LIFE. >> DID SHE HAVE THE TRANSISTOR TAPED TO HER HEAD AT THE TIME. >> Stephen: WAS THAT ENCOURAGED IN YOUR FAMILY, TO SING AROUND THE HOUSE. >> MY MOM ALWAYS SANG. EVERYBODY SANG. THEY SANG THROUGH HARD TIMES. THEY WERE A JOYFUL BUNCH, AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. >> Stephen: YES, AGAIN. >> IF IN MY FAMILY, NOBODY SANG. >> Stephen: IS THIS TRUE? >> YES. >> Stephen: NO SINGING? WAS NOT ENCOURAGED? >> MY FATHER SANG. HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD SINGER, ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW HOW TO PROBE! ( LAUGHTER ) >> STEVE'S A GOOD SINGER. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: IS THERE ANYTHING-- YOU KNEW HIM FIRST AS A COMEDIAN, NO DOUBT, RIGHT IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP THE WAY YOU PLAY THE BANJO AND COMEDY BECAUSE THE BANJO IS PRECISE. >> THE WAY I PLAY IS HILARIOUS. >> Stephen: COMEDY IS VERY PRECISE, AND BANJO PICKING IS VERY PRECISE. >> THAT'S BECAUSE THE WORDS ARE SIMILAR. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THERE'S TIMING, CERTAINLY. >> Stephen: TIMING. >> TIMING. >> Stephen: YES. >> BUT IT'S PRETTY-- IT'S PRETTY VAGUE RELATIONSHIP, I THINK. BUT CERTAINLY IN WRITING LYRICS THERE'S A COMPARISON. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE CONCISE, PRECISE. >> Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT. >> FUNNY OR NOT. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WAY WITH WORDS. >> YES. >> Stephen: SOME PEOPLE DO, STEVE. >> YES, SOME PEOPLE HAVE A WAY WITH WORDS, AND OTHERS NOT HAVE WAY.

WHEN YOU GET ADDICTED TO THE MATERIALISM, YOU REALLY LOSE YOUR SOULFULNESS. AND THAT MIGHT BE WHAT IS HAPPENING TO US, AND I SAW THAT SIMILARITY, AND I DECIDE TO WRITE ABOUT THAT SIMILARITY. BUT, ACTUALLY, MAKING THE MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. I NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD AT BEING BROKE. ( APPLAUSE ) IT WAS WONDERFUL TO KNOW.  ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: THAT IS A GREAT LESSON FOR ALL OF US. LAUGH NO MATTER WHAT'S HAPPENING. WELL, THE BOOK IS "ABOVE THE LINE." THE WOMAN IS THE BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED AND LEGENDARY SHIRLEY MACLAINE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE MUSIC AND ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC. PLEASE WELCOME MAESTRO GUSTAVO DUDAMEL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, FOR THOSE LIKE ME WHO ARE UNINITIATED, WHAT DOES A CONDUCTOR DO? BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THE INSTRUMENTS. THEY SEEM LIKE THEY'RE THE ONES DOING THE WORK. ( LAUGHTER ). >> YES. >> Stephen: IT MIGHT BE VITAL, BUT WHAT IS IT? >> BUT THAT IS THE REALITY OF THE CONDUCTOR. I DON'T DO ANYTHING. CONDUCTORS DON'T DO ANYTHING. WELL, LET'S BE HONEST. I THINK-- THIS IS INSPIRATION. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO PLAY. YOU PROPOSE SOMETHING MUSICAL, BUT YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE INSPIRATIONAL THAN MOVE AND JUMP IN FRONT THEM AND TAKE THE ENERGY. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? NO. >> Stephen: YOU'RE THOUGHT OF AS LIKE A ROCK STAR CONDUCTOR. WHAT DOES THAT-- YOU ARE! YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS LIVING CONDUCTORS. AND WHAT IS IT YOU, YOU BRING AS A CONDUCTOR AND THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC IS BRINGING THAT IS IS UNIQUE. YOU'RE KNOWN ALL AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE WAY YOU BRING THESE COMPOSITIONS TO LIFE IN A NEW WAY. >> YES, BUT I THINK IT IS, YOU KNOW, THE LOVE OF WHAT WE DO. MUSIC IS LIFE. MUSIC IS BEAUTY, YOU KNOW. AND THIS KIND OF POWER THAT MUSIC HAVE IS MAGIC. >> Stephen: WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO A MELODY WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AMERICAN. >> I AM HONORED TO SAY COPLAND'S "FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MAN," BY GUSTAVO DUDAMEL, AND THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC LOSANGELES PHILHARMONIC. MAESTRO, PLEASE.  ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAESTRO, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GUSTAVO DUDAMEL AND THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC ARE NOW ON THEIR 2016 WORLD TOUR!
