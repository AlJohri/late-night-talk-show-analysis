Y BROTHER-IN-LAW. HE LOVED THEM. I HAD TO FLY. I COULDN'T TAKE THEM ON THE PLANE WITH ME. THEY FROWN ON THAT. ANYWAY, I'M EXCITED. >> Jon: COOL. S SAVING ITSWORLD, A LITTLE BIT. SHE'S TRYING TO, TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. >> Jon: RIGHT, JUST LIKE YOU! .JUST 1 INCH AT A TIME AM 1 INCH AT A TIME.  OPRAH ISN'T THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.  I AM TOO. I DRIVE A TESLA, ALL RIGHT. THAT IS MY CONTRIBUTION. OKAY. GLOBAL WARMING.  I LOVE MY TESLA. IT'S SO FAST. IT'S ALL ELECTRIC. IT'S LIKE A GOLF CART HAD SEX WITH A PEGASU S. AND HERE'S A REALLY COOL THING. BECAUSE BASICALLY IT'S LIKE A LAPTOP COMPUTER WITH WHEELS. THEY'RE ALWAYS UPGRADING THE SOFTWARE GIFG YOU THESE COOL NEW FEATURES.  LIKE LAST YEAR THEY MADE IT POSSIBLE TO NAME YOUR TESLA. I NAMED MINE VINGALOT AND IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT REFERENCE, I'M SORRY YOU ALSO HAD SUCH A TOUGH TIME IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT THE TESLA SOFTWARE UPDATES IS THEY HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY OVERNIGHT THROUGH THE CAR'S WIFI SYSTEM.  YOU TURN IT ON IN THE MORNING AND THE SCREEN TELLS YOU ALL THE NEW STUFF IT CAN DO. LIKE NEW AND A HALF GAITION FEATURES, OR UPDATED MENUS. THERE ARE SO MANY SUDDEN CHANGES OVERNIGHT WITH YOUR CAR. IT'S LIKE YOUR CAR IS GOING THROUGH PEUB ERT.-- PU BERTY WHICH MIGHT BE WHY SOMETIMES IT LOCKS ITSELF IN THE GARAGE AN BLASTS MUS YOU CAN AT ITSELF. YESTERDAY, THIS IS TRUE, THERE WAS A PARTICULARLY EXCITING UPGRADE. >> THIS MORNING TESLA OWNER S OWNERS ARE WAKING UP TO A NEW FEATURE, AUTOPILOTS. >> IT ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS YOU TO DO SEM AYE AUTONOMOUS DRIVING WHEN YOU'RE BEHIND THE WHEEL. ESLAOWNERS WOKE UP TO FIND THEIR CARS COULD DRIVE THEMSELVES. FINALLY A HIGH-TECH ALTERNATIVE TO JAMMING A BRICK ON THE GAS PEDESTRIAN ALL AND JUMPING IN THE BACKSEAT. I HAD TO DO THAT FOR TOO LONG.  AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN POSTING INDIVIDUAL YA WITH-- VIDEOS OF THE SELF-DRIVING FEATURE ALL OVER THE INTERNET. >> THE CAR IS WATCHING, IT SEES, OH MY GOSH. OH PIE GOSH, THIS IS SO-- I'M NOT TOUCHING IT AT ALL. AND IT'S DRIVING. OH PIE GOSH, IT'S CHANGING LANES. OH MY GOSH, IT'S CHANGING LANES ON ITS OWN.  CAN NOWCHANGE LANES ON ITS OWN. ALTHOUGH I HAD A PINTO THAT USED TO DO THAT TOO. (LAUGHTER) TRUE. MY FIRST CAR. THAT IS MY FIRST CAR. NOW I CAN SEE REQUEST SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WOULDN'T WANT A CAR THAT DRIVES IT SELF. SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LOSE WHAT THEY CALL THE JOY OF THE ROAD. THAT UNIQUELY AMERICAN FEELING OF INDEPENDENCE WHEN YOU GOT ONE ARM OUT THE WINDOW, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER HAND ON YOUR SLURPEE. YOUR KNEE ON THE WHEEL RIGHT HERE WITH YOUR EYES SCANNING THE HORIZON FOR CHEAP FIREWORKS. BUT AS A MAN, AS A MAN WHO DRIVES INTO MANHATTAN EVERY DAY, LET ME TELL YOU, THERE IS NO JOY OF THE ROAD. MY COMMUTE IS MORE LIKE CORMACK McCARTHY'S THE ROAD. MANY TIMES WHILE I WAS STUCK IN THE LINCOLN TUNNEL I HAVE CONSIDERED GOING CAN I BALANCE.  THAT IS WHY I NEVER-- CANNIBAL THAT IS WHY I NEVER CAR POOL, NOT ANY MORE. (APPLAUSE) SO PERSONALLY CAN I NOT WAIT FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS. NO MORE ROAD RAGE. JUST KICK BACK AND RELAXMENT YOU CAN WATCH MOVIES. YOU CAN TAKE A NAP. AND IF YOU REALLY MISS DRIVING YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY MARIO CART. NOW WHILE YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD, LEGALLY YOU ARE REQUIRED TO KEEP ONE HAND ON THE WHEEL AT ALL TIMES. WHICH IS FINE BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY ONLY NEED ONE HAND TO ENJOY ALL THE PORN YOU'LL BE WATCHING. NOW MOST IMPORTANTLY,-- (APPLAUSE). ephen: I DON'T KNOW WHATTHAT IS. NO PROOF HE'S WATCHING PORN. IMPORTANTLY, SELF-DRIVING CARS WILL BE A LOT SAFER. IN FACT, SOME RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE THEY COULD SAVE 300,000 LIVES PER DECADE. YES, IT WILL DEFINITELY SAVE LIVES. NOT ONLY WILL THE CARS NEVER GET DISTRACTED REDUCING FATAL ACCIDENTS BUT MY TESLA ISN'T GOING TO SUDDENLY YANK THE WHEEL INTO A WENDY'S AT MIDNIGHT TO ORDER A BIGIE FRIES. BESIDE, THIS TECHNOLOGY IS SELF-DRIVING TOWARDS US WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. I'VE HAD 6 BILLIONAIRES ON THIS SHOW SO FAR AND THREE OF THEM ARE WORKING ON SELF-DRIVING CARS. AND LATER TONIGHT I'VE GOT MY 7th BILLIONAIRE, OPRAH WINFREY, I'M GOING TO ASK HER. I'M GOING TO ASK HER IF SHE IS WORKING ON ONE TOO. BECAUSE IF SO, YOU GET A SELF-DRIVING CAR, YOU GET A SELF-DRIVING CAR, YOU GET A SELF-DRIVING CAR! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHOOO! WHOOO! YES! Z I ASSUME. IT WOULD BE DISA POANTING IF NOT. OF COURSE THE MOST FAMOUS NAME IN SELF-DRIVING CARS IS GOGGLE.  THEY'VE ALREADY GOT PROTO TYPES OF THEIR GOGGLE CARS DRIVING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEY THINK YOU'LL HAVE ONE SOON. JUST LISTEN TO THE DIRECTOR OF THEIR AUTO AUTO PROGRAM. >> HOW SOON CAN WE BRING IT OUT? WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY COMPLICATED PROBLEM. BUT THESE ARE MY TWO BOYS, MY OLDEST SON IS 11. AND THAT MEANS IN FOUR AND A HALF YEARS, HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET HIS DRIVERS' LICENSE.  MY TEAM AND I ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. tephen: WOW.THAT IS UNCOOL, MAN. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU WORKING ON, SELF-DRINKING ALCOHOL AND PANTS THAT DRY HUMP THEMSELVES? WHATEVER. POINT IS, I'M ON BOARD WITH THE SELF-DRIVING THING.  I'M READY TO HIT THE CAR POOL LANE WITH MY TWO BUDDIES, GEORGE RR AND JACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OPRAH WINFREY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY T MOBILE. Stephen: WELCOME BACK,EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. SO GET OUT HERE OPRAH WINFREY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> HI, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU. THANKS, JON, THANK YOU, GUYS. WOW. PRETTYEXCITED THAT YOU ARE HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> YOU CHANGED THE PLACE. HAVE, WE CHANGEDIT A LITTLE BIT. >> REED IT. I JUST REMODELED MY HOUSE. I CAN IMAGINE WHAT THIS COST.  YEAH.WE HAD TO TAKE A LOAN OUT. >> I SEE AM I CAN SEE THAT. hen: WELL, THANKS FORBEING HERE. >> I'M EXCITED TO CELEBRATE YOU. phen: TO SELL BRAILT ME?EXCITED. hen: TONIGHT I CELEBRATEMY LOVE. >> FOR YOU.  THIS IS THE THING, I WAS SAYING TO YOUR TEAM THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE A GREATER MARKETING CAMPAIGN.  WERE YOU ON THE BACK OF EVERY BUS. WE COULDN'T GET AWAY FROM YOU. YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. MINGTOO AN ABUTMENT IN YOUR CAR, YOUR AIR BAG WOULD ECK PLOAD AND MY FACE WOULD BE RIGHT ON THERE, IT WAS EVERYWHERE. >> YOU WERE EVERYWHERE. SSURE.THAT IS A LOT OF PRESSURE. AN I REMEMBER WHEN IS WITH MOVING FROM NASHVILLE TO BALTIMORE AS A YOUNG REPORTER. I HAD A SMALLER CAMPAIGN BUT I WAS ON BILLBOARDS AND BUSES. THIS IS LIKE 1976. AND THE CAMPAIGN WAS, WHAT IS AN OPRAH? AND ARE ON EVERYTHING, ON THE BUS. AND THEN WHEN I CAME ON THE AIR T WAS JUST ME, AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT'S OPRAH? SO IT'S A HARD THING TO LIVE UP TO WHEN YOU HAVE SHALL IT-- BUT YOU DID IT. I DON'T HAVE TO LIVEUP TO OPRAH. >> NO, NO, BUT-- . VE MYPICTURE AND THEN WHAT IS AN OPRAH WOULD BE GREAT? >> BUT YOU STEPPED INTO IT. CONGRATULATIONS. >> Stephen: THANK YOU, THANKYOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). n: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.THERE ST. >> THAT WAS A HIGH BAR. YOU FORBEING HERE, THAT IS ALL I NEEDED. OPRAH WINFREY, EVERYBODY. >> THAT IS A HIGH BAR. ABOUTSOMETHING YOU STEPPED INTO. THE SERIES IS CALLED BELIEF. >> YES. Stephen: IT'S GOING TO BE ONOWN. >> YES, STARTING SUNDAY. OF WORLD RELIGIONS AND WHAT THEY MEAN TO INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE'S LIVES.  HOW THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR LIVES, TO MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER AND HOW PEOPLE USE THEM TO SEEK LOVE, FRIENDSHIP, PEACE. WHY DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS SERIES NOW? >> WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN RELIGION. IT'S ABOUT THE HEART OF PEOPLE OPENING UP AND YERNING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS DEEPER AND GREATER. AND SO SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE RELIGIOUS AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE JUST SEEKING IN THEIR OWN WAY. CUZ IN ONE PART OF THE SERIES WE HAD THIS WONDERFUL ROCK CLIMBER NAMED ALEX WHO SAYS HE IS AN ATHEIST AND DOESN'T BELIEVE IN ANY DIETY BUT HIS DEVOTION AND HIS PASSION FOR LIFE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE THREADED THROUGH ALL OF THE STORIES. SO I WANTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE IN ONE OF MY DARKEST MOMENTS WHEN I WAS FORMING THE NETWORK AND I WOULD RUN INTO LORNE MICHAELS WHO SAID OH, BABY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN FOR A HUGE LEARNING CURVE, IT WILL TAKE YOU FIVE YEARS, IT WILL BE HARDER THAN ANYTHING YOU HAVE EVER DONE. I SAID I'LL BE OKAY. AND THEN LEARNED THAT YOU KNOW, DEVELOPING A NETWORK FROM SCRATCH IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT, IMAGINED. SO WHEN I WAS IN THE HEAT OF THE CRISIS, WHEN EVERYBODY WAS SAYING I DONE KNOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT YOUR DAY JOB. I CAN SEE THAT YOU WERE SOME OF THE PEOPLE SAYING THAT. THANK YOU, ALL, FRENLDS. BUT ANYWAY, WHEN PEOPLE WERE SAYING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, I TEND TO GO-- WHEN YOU ARE CHALLENGED IN LIFE, I FIND THAT GOING DEEPER INSIDE YOURSELF, TO ASK THE QUESTION, WHAT DO I REALLY WANT. WHY DID I REALLY MAKE THIS DECISION. AND I HAD SEEN A PLANET EARTH DONE BY THE GREAT DISCOVERY CHANNEL. AND I WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT SPOKE TO THE SPIRIT OF US ALL. MY IMPRESSION HAVING WATCHED IT. ST LIKE. >> WELL, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. WE'LL GET INTO THE DETAILS AND SOME OF THE STORIES THAT MEANT THE MOST TO YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE'LL CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT THE THINGS MOST IMPORTANT IN THE WORLD TO OPRAH WINFREY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE HERE WITH OPRAH WINFREY. NOW WERE TALKING BEFORE ABOUT THE SERIES CALLED BELIEF. , IS THERE A DIFFERENCE FOR YOU BETWEEN FAITH AND BELIEF. >> YEAH, THERE IS. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK THAT THEY ARE FAITHFUL PEOPLE BUT HAVE BELIEFS. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TO THE BE IN THE WORLD WITHOUT BELIEVING IN SOMETHING.  EVEN IF YOU DON'T CALL IT A DIETY. SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN WORKING HARD AND STRIFING FOR THEIR BEST, AND, BUT DON'T CALL THAT, DON'T HAVE A NECESSARY RELIGIOUS BELIEF. AND FAITH IS VERY DIFFERENT, I THINK. FAITH IS KNOWING THAT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF THAT FAITHFUL.  I USED TO BE A LITTLE PREPARER. E HOWLITTLE ARE WE TALKING HERE? >> I'M TALKING LIKE SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 12, 15. AND THEN, YEAH, WHEN I WAS IN THIRD GRADE PEOPLE USED TO CALL ME, HERE COME THAT PREPARER GIRL AGAIN. n: WERE YOU PREPARINGTHE GOSPEL. >> I WAS PREPARING THE GOSPEL, YES, I WAS. I WOULD REMEMBER THE BIBLE VERSES AND PASS AGE. E AFAVORITE VERS FROM THE BIBLE. >> YES, I DO. en: I DO.OKAY, LET'S HEAR YOURS. MMATTHEW, JESUS SAYS SO I SAY TO DO YOU NOT WORRY FOR WHO AMONG YOU BY WORRYING CAN CHANGE A HAIR ON HIS HEAD OR A CUBIC TO THE SPAN OF HIS LIFE. I LIKE IT BECAUSE ST A COMMANDMENT TO NOT WORRY. >> I LOVE THAT. IVE IT, ICAN'T DO IT, BUT I LIKE THAT-- IT'S NOT LIKE TRY NOT TO WORRY, SO I SAY TO YOU, DO NOT WORRY. >> I LOVE THAT.  WORRYARE YOU BEING DISOBEDIENT. >> YOU WORRY, YOU SPINNING.  BUT.MINE IS PSALM37:  4 DELIGHT THY SELF, I LOVE THE WORD, DELIGHT, DON'T YOU. I'M SO GLAD THAT DAVID GNAW IT. AVID WAS INTODELIGHTING HIMSELF. (LAUGHTER). n: OKAY, HOW ABOUTTHESE STORIES. >> WAIT, DELIGHT THY SELF IN THE LORD. HE WILL GIVE YOU THE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART. NOW WHAT THAT SAYS TO ME, LORD HAS A WIDE RANGE. WHAT IS LORD. COMPASSION, LOVE, FORGIVENESS, KINDNESS. SO YOU DELIGHT YOURSELF IN THOSE VIRTUES, WHERE THE CHARACTER OF THE LORD IS REVEALED. DELIGHT THY SELF IN GOODNESS, KINDNESS, AND WILL YOU RECEIVE THE DESIRES OF YOUR HEART. ephen: THAT.DON'T YOU LIKE THAT? YEAH.IT SAYS TO ME, IF YOU FOCUS ON BEING A FORCE FOR GOOD, THEN GOODNESS WILL COME, WHICH IS ALSO THE THIRD LAW OF MOTION WHICH IS ALSO THE KARMA WHICH IS ALSO THE GOLDEN RULE. en: WHICH IS ALSO THESECRET TOO. >> KIND OF, YEAH. Stephen: A LITTLE BIT, LIKETHAT. IS THERE, ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT BELIEFS, AS YOU SAID, THERE IS ATHEISTS IN THIS, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO. >> CHRISTIAN, HINDU, BUDDHIST, MUSLIM. STORY OR IS THERE-- OKAY, IF YOU HADN'T BEEN RAISED CHRISTIAN WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS AND GO WHAT IS MY SECOND CHOICE, I HAD TO PEC A SECOND ONE. BASED ON STORIES, NOT AN ULTIMA OPRAH JUDGEMENT. THIS IS OPRAH RELIGION CLUB. >> OKAY. TREALLY APPEALED TO YOU, A STORY THAT REALLY APPEALED TO YOU. >> THE GREAT THING ABOUT BELIEF IS THAT IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE RANGE AND TO BE WHAT I'M HOPING IS MORE SEPG.  BECAUSE YOU KNOWK WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD WHERE PEOPLE TRY TO JUST TOLERATE EACH OTHER.  THAT HARD.NOT THAT HARD EITHER. AND I WANT TO SAY, MY GOD, PEOPLE, IT'S THE PLANET EARTH. WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT, AN WE'RE ALL HERE TO LEARN TO ACCEPT EACH OTHER'S DIFFERENCES. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES US THE PLANET EARTH. (APPLAUSE) >> THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT. SO ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE STORY, MY FAVORITE STORY IS AN ABORIGINAL GRANDFATHER WHO IS TRYING TO TEACH HIS GRANDSON WHAT HE CALLS THE SONG LINE. NOW I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A SONG LINE BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVE, THAT THE ANSWER, THAT THEY WERE SUNG INTO EXISTENCE OR SANG INTO EXISTENCEMENT AND HE'S TEACHING THE SONG LINE AND AS HE'S WATCHING HIS GRANDSON, PASSING ON THE STORY OF THEIR ANCESTRAL 50,000 YEAR OLD HISTORY, HE SAYS I HAVE TO PASS THESE WORDS ON TO MY GRANDSON, OTHERWISE HE WON'T KNOW WHO HE IS. AND THAT TO ME IS SO TRUE. THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR GRANDMOTHERS AND MOTH ARES AND GRANDFATHERS TELLING YOU WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU COME FROM, THEN HE WILL BE LOST. HE SAYS HAVE I TO PASS THIS ON TO MY GRANDSON SO HE WILL NOT BE LOST. >> Stephen: I LOVE THATBECAUSE. >> YEAH. ONEOF THE STORIES I REALLY LIKED IS, IT'S A YOUNG MAN, ABOUT TO BE A YOUNG MAN, I BELIEVE IN BUD A PEST AND HE IS ABOUT TO HAVE HIS BAR MISS VA. AND THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL-- BARMIT DID VAH, A BEAUTIFUL STORY, JIM, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. >> THIS IS A TIME WHERE MEN GO TO BEGIN THINKING MORE ABOUT THE WORLD, AND HIS PLACE IN IT. >> NOW I WILL BE STARTING QUESTIONING THINGS. WHY IS THE SKY BLUE, WHY IS THE GRASS GREEN. IS GOD-- . >> MY SON, I LIKE THE WAY HE QUESTIONS THINGS. QUESTIONING IS-- . >> DOING HIS BARMIT DID VAL HE WILL DO A SERVICE AND READ ALLOW FROM THE TORAH, THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS OF THE HEBREW BIBLE. OUTTHAT STORY, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT STORY, AND I LOVE ABOUT SO MANY OF THE STORIES, LIKE THE STORY OF THE NINE YEAR OLD JUMPING FROM THE TOWER ON PENTACOST ISLAND IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC FOR HIS FATHER IS THAT, YOU KNOW, I GO TO CHURCH AND I AM SOME WHAT RELIGIOUS. AN WHEN I TRY TO EXPLAIN TO SOME PEOPLE WHO AREN'T, OR THAT I HAVE A BELIEF. I SAY WELL, I WAS GIVEN THIS BY MY ANCESTORS. I LOOK AT MY CHILDREN, I THOUGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE THEM ANYTHING THAT I WOULD HELP THEM SO I ASSUME I WAS GIVEN THIS BY MY ANCESTORS BECAUSE THEY GAVE IT TO ME TO TRY TO HELP ME. AND I OPEN IT LIKE A BOX AND WONDER WHAT IS INSIDE. BUT I DON'T THINK HAVE I GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM AT ANY POINT. >> I DON'T THINK WE EVER DO. tephen: KEEP TAKING THE GIFTOUT. IT IS NOT THE ONLY GIFT YOU CAN GET, I ACCEPT THAT. >> BOY YOU'RE DEEP. NK YOUFOR THIS BEAUTIFUL SERIES. AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE REST OF IT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
