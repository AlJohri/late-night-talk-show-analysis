IT'S SOME SORT OF PRETEND CELEBRATION AND HE'SULA SEWING MCKRINGLEBERRY, BUT WRLZ THE ROPE. >> HE'S MIMING, HE'S DRAWING MCKRINGLEBERRY IN, WHO IS SHIMMING IN IT IN, THROWING IT OVER A TREE LIMB, AND FRONTIER JUSTICE. >> THAT TOOK A DARK, DARK TURN, NOT SURE HOW THAT IS A CELEBRATION. >> THE REF MIMES A FLAG, AND THE PLAYERS ARE UPSET. IT APPEARS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN INVISIBLE BOX. >> AND THE REF IS MIMING A SHOWER. >> THE REF HAS PANTOMIME SOAP IN HIS EYES. IT MIGHT PUT HIM BACK IN THE REF'S GOOD GRACES. NOPE, IT DRAWS A FLAG. AND TOUCHDOWN MATTHIAS. HE IS PUMPED ABOUT THAT ONE. DOES A LITTLE QUICK HOT POTATO WITH THE BALL. >> THAT'S A CLASSIC. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. GOOD TO SEE. >> SPOKE TOO SOON. HERE'S MCKRINGLEBERRY IN A FULL HAZMAT SUIT. >> IS THAT A TANK OF LIQUID NITROGEN? >> APPARENTLY SO. IT LOOK LIKES -- YES, HE'S COOLING OFF THE HOT GAME BALL, AND HE PRESENTS IT BACK TO MATTHIAS WHO HAD A HAMMER IN HIS PANTS. THAT'S A NEW WAY TO SPIKE THE BALL. >> THE LEAGUE IS GOING TO MAKE HIM PLAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT BALL. >> THE REF HAS THE FLAG OUT. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IT WAS PREFROZEN. TOUCHDOWN, MCKRINGLEBERRY, WHAT A GAME HE'S HAVING. AND THERE'S THE SPIKE. AND HE'S PULLED SOMETHING OUT OF HIS UNIFORM. >> WHAT'S HE DOING NOW, DICK? IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S INFLAIGHT SOMETHING. >> REF CLEARLY WARNING HIM HE'S ON THIN ICE. >> MCKRINGLEBERRY ASKING FAIR MOMENT WHILE HE FINISHES WHATEVER HE'S DOING. THE REF IS READY WITH THAT WHIST EXPEL HAND ON FLAG. MCKRINGLEBERRY BETTER WATCH IT HERE. WHAT IS HAPPENING-- IS THAT REALLY? IT'S A BOUNCY CASTLE. AND HE'S GOING TO CELEBRATE WITH A BIG OLD BOUNCE AROUND THAT BOUNCY CASTLE. >> CAN'T BLAME HIM. THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN. HERE COMES MATTHIAS JOINING HIM. >> THE REF HAS TO FLAG THIS. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE WHIST NEL ANY SECOND. NO, HE'S IN THE CASTLE HIM. >> HE BETTER BE CAREFUL. I RENTED ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY AND HALF THE GIRLS GOT A STAPH INFECTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: KEY AND PEELE'S NEW MOVIE "KEANU" OPPOSE APRIL 29. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK BACK WITH MEGYN KELLY, EVERYBODY. >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE HOST OF "THE KELLY FILE" ON FOX NEWS, THE SECOND MOST-WATCHED SHOW ON CABLE NEWS. PLEASE WELCOME MEGYN KELLY! â™ª â™ª â™ª ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: NOW, THEN, MMS. KELLEY, WHY IS FOX NEWS FEUDING WITH DONALD TRUMP? WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST THAT GOOD MAN? HE'S JUST A BILLIONAIRE WHO ALSO WANTS TO HAVE THE NUCLEAR LAUNCH CODES. >> NOW, CRUMP HAS BEEN ON FOX NEWS 140 TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR. SO WE ARE NOT FEUDING WITH HIM. BUT HE DOES HAVE A BEEF WITH ME. >> Stephen: ANOTHER YES, HE DOES HAVE A BEEF WITH YOU. HE HAS-- HE HAS TWEETED SOME THINGS ABOUT YOU. >> I'M FAMILIAR. >> Stephen: HE TWEETED THIS RECENTLY. HE SAID-- THIS IS THE TWEET-- "I REFUSE TO CALL MEGYN KELLY A BIMBO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY CORRECT." IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO REFUSE TO CALL HIM RIGHT NOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANYTHING? NOW, REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT CALLING HIM THESE THINGS. BLOWHARD, SECOND-PLACE LOSER? ANYTHING? >> THE ONLY THING I REALLY WANTED TO ASK HIM WAS, YOU KNOW, HE RECENTLY SAID THAT HIS SUPPORTERS ARE SO DEVOTED TO HIM THAT HE COULD GO IN THE MIDDLE OF 5th AVENUE AND SHOOT SOMEBODY AND HE WOULDN'T LOSE A SINGLE VOTER. IN RESPONSE TO WHICH I WANTED TO HIM ASK, "WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?" >> Stephen: EXACTLY. I BET YOU'RE ON 5th AVENUE FAIRLY OFTEN. >> I NEVER GO THERE ANYWHERE. >> Stephen: THIS SORT OF, WHAT HE PERCEIVED AS A CONFLICT BETWEEN YOU AND DONALD TRUMP BECAME THE 0 AND YOU IN SOME WAYS BECAME THE STORY. DO YOU LIKE BEING THE STORY? >> OH, YEAH, IT WAS DELIGHTFUL. IT WAS TERRIFIC, TWITTER AND PAPARAZZI. NO. >> Stephen: REALLY? WERE PEOPLE FOLLOWING YOU AROUND TO SEE WHETHER-- >> YES, WHICH WAS SUCH A BIZARRE SITUATION. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE MARGOT, YOU'RE USED TO THAT. WHEN YOU'RE MEGYN, YOU DON'T WANT THAT. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO OUTSIDE WITHOUT MY MAKEUP ON AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. >> Stephen: IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE NEVER THE STORY, MEGYN KELLY. I MEAN THE COVER OF "VANITY FAIR." >> THAT WAS OKAY. >> Stephen: YOU ARE SOMETIMES-- SOMETIMES IT'S OKAY TO BE THE STORY. >> THAT WAS OKAY. NO, BUT IT WAS A SURREAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME BECAUSE REALLY WHAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY WAS I ASKED HIM A DEBATE QUESTION HE REALLY DIDN'T LIKE. >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY FAIR QUESTION AND I TO THIS MOMENT THINK IT WAS. >> Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE MODERATOR OF THE MARCH DEBATE. >> MARCH 3. >> Stephen: HE HAS AGREED TO BE IN. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE A FIRST QUESTION FOR HIM? >> I DO, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU. >> Stephen: HERE'S MY RECOMMENDATION-- FIRST QUESTION, "MR. TRUMP, BOO! ." >> I'M ANYTHING TO START WITH, "APOLOGY ACCEPTED." >> Stephen: OH! THAT WOULD BE LOVELY. >> NO. NO, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HIM COMING. I FEEL LIKE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAD FOR HIM THE LAST GO-AROUND I'M JUST GOING TO MOVE OVER TO THE MARCH 3 DEBATE RUNDOWN. AND THEN WE'RE ANYTHING TO HAVE AT IT, JUST LIKE I'VE HAD AT IT WITH ALL THE OTHER GUYS AND CARLY WHO HAS BEEN UP THERE AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A ROBUST EXCHANGE AND I THINK HE'S GOING TO WALK AWAY THINKING, WHAT WAS MY PROBLEM? I THINK IT WILL BE FINE. >> Stephen: HOW DO YOU FEEL FOR THE WAY IT WAS SPLIT UP BETWEEN THE KIDS' TABLES AND ADULTS' TABLE. THESE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO DEVOTED THEIR LIVES TO DOING SOMETHING FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND DONALD TRUMP IS LIKE THE LEAD AT THE BIG BOYS' TABLE. >> TRUMP HAS ELECTRIFIED THE REPUBLICAN BASE. HE HAS EARNED HIS PLACE IN THE CENTER. ALTHOUGH LAST TIME WE KNOT WORD HE MIGHT COME LATE TO THE DEBATE BECAUSE HE WAS DOING THE THING FOR THE VETERANS THING, AND WE GOT WORD HE MIGHT SHOW NUPT MIDDLE OF THE DEBATE. >> Stephen: JUST COME ROARING UP ON A JET SKI? >> WHAT WILL WE DO? MAYBE WE HAVE TO BRING A PODIUM TO THE SIDE. HE'S EARNED HIS PLACE IN THE MIDDLE. >> Stephen: WHO IS IT LIKE TO MODERATE ONE OF THESE DEBATES? IS IT LIKE PUPPIES IN A BOX? HOW DO YOU CONTROL THEM? ESPECIALLY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THEY'RE ATTACKING EACH OTHER SO MUCH NOW. >> YOU THINK SORT OF YOU SEND THE MESSAGE ONCE YOU'RE PREPARED AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM GET AWAY WITH TOO MUCH BREAKING THE RULES. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU SORT OF SEND THAT NEJ A STRONG WAY FIRST TIME AROUND AND THE OTHER GUYS GET IT. LIKE, TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU WE HAVE VIDEOTAPE. AND THEN THEY LEARN. OH, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T CHALLENGE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO ROLL OUT A VIDEOTAPE. >> Stephen: THAT SOUND MORE LIKE BLACKMAIL, ACTUALLY. >> I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, SOME OF THEM WILL TRY TO BEAT UP THE MOTTERATORS AND SOME OF THEM WILL TRY TO BREAK THE EXPRIEWLZ YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS A DEBATE, THAT YOU'RE RUNNING IT. THEY'VE AGREED ON THESE RULES, SO IT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO THE AUDIENCE IF THEY COAPT ABIDE BY THEM. IT'S ARE 15 FOR US TO LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUYS. IT'S OUR JOB NOT TO BE LIKED BUT PUT ON A GOOD DEBATE. SEE YOU NEED TO BE LIKED. >> Stephen: BUT LOOK PEOPLE DO LIKE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ACTUALLY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOU. >> OH, GOOD. >> Stephen: WOULD YOU STICK AROUND? >> ABSOLUTE, WITH THAT TEASE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE MEGYN KELLY. >> Stephen: WE'RE BACK WITH MEGYN KELLY. MEGYN, YOU'RE LIVE EVERY NIGHT. >> EVERY NIGHT AT 9:00 WE ARE LIVE. >> Stephen: DO YOU LIKE IT? >> I DO, I LOVE IT. I THINK IT ADDS A LOT TO THE SHOW. I MISS BEING AT HOME WITH MY BABES, I HAVE THREE KIDS UNDER SEVEN BUT IT'S HARD TO FIND THE BALANCE-- THE SHOWS BEFORE ME AND AFTER ME ARE TAPED-- YOU LOSE A LOT. >> Stephen: IT'S ORILEY AND HANNITY, YOU'RE IN AN ORILEY AND HANNITY SANDWICH. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: AND THOSE GUYS JUST PHONE IT IN. >> LET'S SAY THEY TAPE EARLIER IN THE DAY WHICH IS AN ADVANTAGE TO US. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WOW, OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, IT'S INTERESTING SOMPT RANGE OF PEOPLE WHO ENJOY YOUR SHOW AND LIKE YOU, PARENTALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP. YOU ARE A RELUCTANT FEMINIST ICON. SOME PEOPLE ON THE LEFT SEE YOU AS A HARDWORKING WOMAN WORKING IN THE BOYS' CLUB, AND BEING ATTACKED BY THE BOYS, AND PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT MIGHT NOT WANT YOU TO ACCEPT THAT FEMINIST STATUE STAUS. HOW DO YOU FEEL? DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU REPRESENT A FORM OF FEMINISM? >> WELL, I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD "FEMINIST." >> Stephen: WHY NOT? >> I THINK IT'S ALIENATING AND THE REASON I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN CO-OPTED BY SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT YOU THEIR CLUB UNLESS YOU SEE CERTAIN WOMEN'S ISSUES THE WAY THEY SEE THEM. I LIKE MORE THE CHERYL SANDBERG APPROACH, HAD IS TAKE THE MOST DIVISIVE ISSUES AND TABLE THOSE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN AGREE ON AS WOMEN. BUT MY OWN BRAND OF FEMINISM, IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS, IS NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT IS JUST TO DO IT. I LIKE THE STEVE MARTIN MOTTO, "BE SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU." I WAS NEVER LINED UP OUTSIDE MY BOSS' OFFICE, GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY. GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY. THERE'S NOT A WOMAN IN PRIME-TIME OR WHATEVER IT WAS AT THE TIME. I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE SO GOOD THEY COULDN'T IGNORE ME. AND I BELIEVE THE BEST SORT OF ANSWER AND THE BEST WAY FORWARD FOR YOUNG WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WANT TO GET AHEAD IS WORK YOUR-- WORK YOUR TAIL OFF. WORK HARDER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. BE BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE, DO BETTER, TRY HARDER. >> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THINGS LIKE, NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORK, THERE ARE FEMINIST ISSUES LIKE THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY WESTERN COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT HAVE PAID MATERNITY LEAVE. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE THAT. >> I ACTUALLY TOOK THIS UP. I ACTUALLY TOOK THIS UP ON MY SHOW WITH MIKE GALLER GER GER WHO WHEN I WAS ON MY MATERNITY LEAVE CALLED IT A RACKET. AND WE HAD TO HAVE A HEART-TO-HEART THAT IT WAS NOT A VACATION. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS ON WHICH WE CAN ALL AGREE. I HAD IT MADE BECAUSE I HAD A BOSS WHO GAVE ME PAID MATERNITY LEAVE BY CONTRACT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT, AND YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOUR BABY AND YOUR JOB. >> Stephen: I TOTALLY AGREE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. "THE KELLY FILE" IS WEEKDAYS AT 9:00 AND MEGYN KELLY IS ANCHORING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY COVERAGE AT 9:00 P.M. ON THIS SATURDAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
