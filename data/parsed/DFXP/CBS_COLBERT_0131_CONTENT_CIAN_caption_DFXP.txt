THAT'S RIGHT TONIGHT, I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE JULIE WAINWRIGHT, MY SIDEVICE PRESIDENT RUNNING MATE. YOU'RE MY ROCK. THANK YOU.

Announcer: TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES THE CAST OF "THE GOOD WIFE"! HANK HANK AND PHIL KNIGHT, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN" AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: THANK YOU, JON! GOOD TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND! NICE TO SEE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN COLBERT. PLEASE, EVERYBODY, WE'VE GOT TO GET STRAIGHT TO. SO MUCH SHOW TONIGHT, THERE'S BIG NEWS IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEK. I MEAN LIKE 2,000 POUNDS BIG. YESTERDAY, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES VOTED TO NAME THE BISON AMERICA'S NATIONAL MAMMAL. SO GIVE IT UP FOR THE BISON, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE BISON. THE BISON, TRULY AMERICA'S FAT HAIRY HORSE. OF COURSE, THE BISON IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE AMERICAN BUFFALO BECAUSE EARLY AMERICANS CONFUSED IT FOR A DIFFERENT SPECIES. IT'S AN EASY MISTAKE AND THE ONLY MISTAKE THE SETTLERS MADE. (LAUGHTER) WHAT AN HONOR FOR AN ANIMAL THAT ALMOST WENT EXTINCT THANKS TO ITS DELICIOUS WINGS. TOUCH AND GO THERE FOR A WHILE. AS ONE CONGRESSMAN PUT IT YESTERDAY, NO OTHER SPECIES TELLS AMERICA'S STORY BETTER THAN THIS NOBLE CREATURE, TO WHICH I SAY, REALLY? NO OTHER CREATURE? WHAT ABOUT THIS CREATURE? YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I DON'T MEAN JUST ME. YOU KNOW I DON'T MEAN JUST ME. LAST TIME I CHECKED, HUMANS ARE MAMMALS AS WELL. FOR PETE'S SAKE, FOU FOUR OUT OF FIVE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE MAMMALS. ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE A SPACE LIZARD IN A CONVINCING HUMAN COSTUME. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHICH ONE -- TED CRUZ. SO... (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOT TO HAVE THAT THING TAILORED. NO DISRESPECT. NO DISRESPECT TO OUR FRIEND THE BISON. BUT IF THERE'S A NATIONAL MAMMAL, IT IS US, THE AMERICAN HUMAN. WE BUILT THE RAILROAD. THE AMERICAN HUMAN PUT THE FIRST HUMAN ON THE MOON. THE AMERICAN HUMAN WROTE "YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME," AND THAT IS NOT EVEN BON JOVI'S BEST SONG, BUT STILL WAY BETTER THAN ANY SONG ANY BISON EVER WROTE. PLUS IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT NATIONAL ANIMALS IS THAT YOU CAN'T EAT THEM. SO EITHER WE CAN'T EAT THE BISON ANYMORE OR THEY'RE BEARING THE LEAD HERE AND WE CAN NOW EAT BALD EAGLES. MMM... YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. IMAGINE HOW GOOD THEY'D TASTE WITH BUFFALO SAUCE. SAVE THE BEAK FOR DIPPING. SOME OF MY FAVORITE HUMANS ARE JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN." SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (HUMMING TUNE) THAT'S A NEW SONG, JON. THAT'S A HAPPY SONG. WHAT'S THAT SONG?
Jon: IT'S CALLED TRUE HAPPINESS.
Stephen: TRULY?
Jon: YES, TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE TITLE, IT EMBODIES HAPPINESS.
Stephen: IT TRULY DOES, THANK YOU, JOHN.
Jon: IT'S LIKE BITE-SIZED SNICKERS. IT EMBODIES THE HAPPINESS.
Stephen: BITE-SIZE SNICKERS TECHNICALLY EMBODY FUNNESS, THEY'RE NOT A HAPPY SIZE.
Jon: BUT FUN CAN BE EQUATED TO HAPPINESS BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE FUN, WE'RE HAPPY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: I SEE. I SEE. I TELL YOU WHO'S NOT HAVING TOO MUCH FUN RIGHT NOW, THAT'S TED CRUZ. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M STILL REALING FROM YESTERDAY'S BIG NEWS OUT OF THE CRUZ CAMPAIGN. FIRST THAT THERE IS STILL A TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN. SECOND, THAT HE NAMED A RUNNING MATE YESTERDAY. THAT IS BOLD. AFTER TUESDAY'S HUGE WINS BY CLINTON AND TRUMP. BERNIE SANDERS SAW THE WRITING ON THE WALL AND LAID OFF HUNDREDS OF STAFFERS. MEANWHILE, TED CRUZ COVERED UP THE WRITING ON THE WALL WITH A HANG IN THERE BABY POSTER. TAKE A LOOK AT HIS HISTORISH MOMENT.
AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF CONSIDERATION AND PRAYER, I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF I AM NOMINATED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT I WILL RUN ON A TICKET WITH MY V-VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, CARLY FIORINA.
Stephen: YES, TED CRUZ. HAS FOUND. A RUN. NING MATE. (APPLAUSE) AS THE FORMER HEAD OF HEWLETT PACKARD, FIORINA IS THE PERFECT CHOICE TO BALANCE THE TICKET AND SAVE SOME MONEY ON TONE ER-- AND I GOTTA SAY, TED CRUZ HAS GOT SOME SERIOUS WHAIFOS RANCHEROS TO ANNOUNCE A VICE PRESIDENT AT THIS STAGE. IT REMINDS ME OF ONE OTHER HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT.
THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN. PLEASE, EVERYONE, WE ARE MAIN CAL -- REMAIN CALM. I HAVE IMPORTANT NEWS. I HAVE CHOSEN A VICE CAPTAIN. HER NAME IS PAM, AND SHE'S GOING TO STAY WITH US TILL THE END!
Stephen: AND FIORINA WAS CLEARLY HONORED TO ACCEPT THIS IMPORTANT JOB THAT WILL NEVER EXIST.
I'VE COME TO KNOW TED AND HEIDI AND CAROLINE AND CATHERINE. ♪ I KNOW TWO GIRLS THAT I JUST ADORE ♪ ♪ I'M SO HAPPY I CAN SEE THEM MORE ♪ ♪ 'CAUSE WE TRAVEL ON THE BUS ALL DAY ♪ ♪ WE GET TO PLAY ♪ ♪ WE GET TO PLAY ♪ (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Stephen: IT'S LIKE DISNEY GAVE THE WICKED STEP-MOTHER HER OWN SONG. ♪ I KNOW ♪ ♪ I KNOW ♪ ♪ I KNOW A GIRL NAMED CINDERELLA ♪ ♪ I'M GONNA LOCK THAT GIRL IN THE CELLA ♪ (LAUGHTER) YES, OF COURSE, TED CRUZ ISN'T ALONE. ALL THE CANDIDATES ARE STARTING TO VET THEIR POTENTIAL VPs. SO FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE ON THE SHORT LIST, HERE ARE TIPS ON HOW TO BE THE MOST APPEALING RUNNING MATE POSSIBLE. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S JUST THE TIP. VICE PRESIDENT CANDIDATE POSITION. POTENTIAL VPs, MY FIRST TIP, YOU HAVE TO PREP FOR THE STATE OF THE UNION WHERE, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, THE VICE PRESIDENT'S JOB IS TO BLINK, CLAP AND OCCASIONALLY STAND UP. SO, TO PRACTICE, JUST STARE AT A BRIGHT LIGHT IN A ROOM FULL OF MOSQUITOES. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) TIP NUMBER TWO, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO ATTRACT A KEY VOTING DEMO, SO CONSIDER HAVING AN HISPANIC LAST NAME. ELIZABETH WARREN, MEH ISABEL JUARREN-TINEZ. SI! TIP THREE, AS VICE PRESIDENT YOU WILL BE SENT TO PLACES THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT WANT TO GO. SO PRACTICE THIS BY GOING TO COSTCO ON A SUNDAY MORNING. HOW CAN THAT MANY PEOPLE ALL NEED BULK CHEESE BALLS AT 9:00 A.M.? FINALLY, A SCANDAL IS TERRIBLE FOR ANY CAMPAIGN, WHICH MEANS NO SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET. SO TRY NOT TO HAVE DONE ANYTHING FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS, WHICH WILL BE GOOD TRAINING FOR WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING AS VICE PRESIDENT, WHICH, AGAIN, IS THIS -- ♪ WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE CAST OF "THE GOOD WIFE"!

Stephen: JULIANA,, MATT, CHRISTINE, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. DOES IT SEEM LIKE YOU JUST STARTED?
NO.
Stephen: YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DOCTORS AT THE END OF THIS, SEVEN YEARS!
ACTUALLY, ONE OF OUR BACKGROUND ARTISTS, EARNEST PIERRE, CAME UP TO ME THE SECOND TO THE LAST DAY OF SHOOTING AND SAID, MA'AM, I'M TAKING THE BAR AND I WILL BE A LAWYER. I HAVE BEEN GOING TO LAW SCHOOL THIS WHOLE TIME, AND HE'S BEEN WITH US SINCE DAY ONE.
Stephen: WOW! THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
YEAH, AND IT MADE ALL OF US LOOK REALLY BAD.
Stephen: I'M STILL AN ACTOR --
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO DECIDED TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL, WENT TO LAW SCHOOL, PASSED AT THE NEW YORK BAR AND PRACTICED AT THE BROOKLYN D.A.'S OFFICE WHILE I WAS DOING THE SHOW. A LOT OF LIFE HAPPENS IN THE COURSE OF SEVEN YEARS.
Stephen: DID SHE EVER SAY, MOM, I DO THIS FOR REAL. I HAVE TO KNOW MY STUFF. DOES SHE EVER CORRECT YOU?
NO, I HAVE TO SAY, SHE HAD MIRED THE SHOW FOR ITS ACCURACY, THOUGH SHE DID SAY CASES HAPPENED WAY TOO FAST, IT HAPPENS IN THE COURSE OF THREE DAYS ON TV LAW, BOOM BOOM, YOU WIN THE CASE IN LESS THAN A WEEK.
Stephen: WHAT'S IT LIKE TO SAY GOODBYE TO EACH OTHER AFTER SEVEN YEARS?
SAD. WE'RE NOT SAYING GOODBYE. WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE GREAT FRIENDS FOR LIFE.
Stephen: YEAH, BUT YOU WON'T BE TOGETHER EVERY DAY.
AT LEAST WE'LL BE DRINKING WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER THIS TIME.
Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. THERE WAS NO DRINKING BEFORE?
NOT ON SET, DEAR GOD.
Stephen: WELL, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW, SOME SETS ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHER SETS.
YES.
Stephen: DID YOU EVER HAVE TO JUST SPIT OUT THINGS YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
EVERY DAY. I ACTUALLY TOOK THE LSAT BEFORE BECOMING AN ACTOR. I DID SO BAD THAT I BECAME AN ACTOR. TRUE STORY. (LAUGHTER) I MAJORED IN HISTORY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON.
Stephen: GREAT, VERY HIGH GIRL-TO-BOY RATIO WITH THAT COLLEGE.
WHY I WENT THERE.
Stephen: THAT'S WHY A LOT OF GUYS GO THERE.
THAT AND DRINKING. I TOOK THE LSAT EXAM, DID SO HORRIBLY, BECAME AN ACTOR AND NOW I LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE LAW THAN I EVER NEWEL TAKE IT AGAIN.
I COULDN'T DO ANY WORSE.
Stephen: THE INITIAL PREMISE OF THE SHOW, THE SHOW, YOU KNOW, GREW, WAS BOTH A POPULAR AND CRITICAL SUCCESS, AND IT BROADENED WHAT IT WAS ABOUT BUT INITIALLY IT WAS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO WAS THE GOOD WIFE OF A HUSBAND WHO HAD CHEATED, A POLITICIAN WHO HAD CHEATED ON HER.
RIGHT, STATE'S ATTORNEY.
Stephen: AFTER LOOKING BACK SEVEN YEARS, DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR A WOMAN TO BE A SLEAZE BALL AND A MAN TO STAND NEXT TO HER? DON'T YOU THINK WE'VE COME FAR ENOUGH AS A NATION THAT A MAN WOULD HAVE TO STAND EMBARRASSED NEXT TO SOMEONE?
IT WOULD BE A MIRACLE. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED, I GOT THE QUESTION WOULD THIS EVER HAPPEN IF THE WOMAN WAS THE ONE WHO WAS THE POLITICIAN? AND WHEN I STARTED THE SHOW, I WAS A NEW MOM AND WIFE AND DOING 14 HOURS A DAY, AND I LOOKED AND SAID, WOMEN DON'T HAVE TIME --
Stephen: DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE SLEAZE BALLS? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL GET THERE SOME DAY, BABY.
I THINK IT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING TO SEE. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD EVER HAPPEN. WOMEN, WE'RE TOO SMART TO DO THAT.
Stephen: TOO SMART? (APPLAUSE) NOT TOO NICE? JUST TOO SMART TO GET CAUGHT?
AT LEAST TO DO IT AND GET CAUGHT. I MEAN, YEAH, I DO BELIEVE THAT WOMEN ARE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE THE LEVEL OF TAKING A PICTURE OF THINGS AND TWEETING THEM.
IT'S JUST S& SILLY, SO DUMB TO DO THAT THINKING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET CAUGHT.
I AGREE.
Stephen: I DO AGREE. I'M NOT ACTING. I'M HONEST ABOUT. THIS DO YOUNG LAWYERS COME UP TO YOU AND SAY YOU'VE INFLUENCED ME OR I LOVE THE PORTRAYAL OF LAWYERS THAT YOU DO ON THE SHOW?
I HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY OVERWHELMED, SINCE WE ANNOUNCED WE WERE ENDING, THE LETTERS STARTED FLYING IN, AND I'VE READ OVER 200 LETTERS ABOUT GIRLS WHO STARTED IN COLLEGE WATCHING THE SHOW AND NOW ALL HAVE THEIR LAW DEGREE AND THEY SAY BECAUSE OF THE SHOW. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO, THEN STARTED WATCHING AND REALLY LOVED THE IDEA OF GOING INTO LAW AND MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE AND A LOT ARE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYERS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACETS THEY'RE GOING ON BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE INFLUENCED ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT WATCH.
MY EXPERIENCE WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. I HAD A NAKED MAN IN A GYM, ACTUALLY IN A LOCKER ROOM, COME UP TO ME AND WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE SHOW. (LAUGHTER) HE WAS STANDING UP --
Stephen: HOW EXCITED WAS HE?
HE WAS VERY EXCITED. HE WAS STANDING UP AND I WAS SITTING DOWN AND --
Stephen: OKAY. DID YOU OFFER TO SPOT HIM?
I WAS VERY -- I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY FALSE MOVES.
Stephen: HE SAID? I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE SAID. IT WAS LIKE THE CHARLIE BROWN TEACHER GOING WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, AND I SAID THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Stephen: BUT IT SEEMED POSITIVE.
HIGHLY POSITIVE.
Stephen: CHRISTINE, DO YOU GET ANY FREE LEGAL ADVICE NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A LAWYER SO MANY YEARS?
NO, BUT AT THE EMMY AWARDS A LAW PROFESSOR OF A PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL SAID I WAS A ROLE MODEL FOR HER STUDENTS, THAT SHE CONSIDERED ME A ROLE MODEL WHICH GOB SMACKED ME. I THOUGHT, HOW GREAT. THIS SHOW WAS SO WELL WRITTEN AND PORTRAYED WOMEN IN SUCH A WONDERFUL WAY, STRONG WOMEN. (APPLAUSE)
THERE ARE TWO MORE EPISODES. THIS SUNDAY, THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY, AND THAT'S IT.
AND THAT'S IT.
Stephen: AND WE HAVE A CLIP BETWEEN YOU JULIANNA AND YOU, MATT, THIS SUNDAY'S EPISODE COMING UP.
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN THIS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT, CARY. I NEVER MEANT YOU ANY HARM.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S AMAZING, ALICIA? AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WORKING TOGETHER, YOU STILL THINK I WOULD COME IN HERE INTO A COURT OF LAW AND PURGER MYSELF TO HURT YOU. I WAS HERE TO TELL THE TRUTH. WHAT ARE YOU HERE TO DO?
Stephen: THAT'S COLD. (APPLAUSE) WHAT ARE YOU HERE TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW...
Stephen: WELL, IF YOU GUYS, LIKE I SAID, YOU HAVE BEEN IN COLLEGE TOGETHER, LAW SCHOOL TOGETHER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE SOMETHING IN EACH OTHER'S YEAR BOOKS ATTEND OF THIS, WHAT MIGHT YOU SAY?
LET'S GO OUT FOR MARTINIS AND A BURGER.
Stephen: OKAY, I WOULDN'T WRITE THAT IN A HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK BUT YES.
I HAD A GUY WHO WOULD RUN AROUND AND GET TO THE YEAR BOOK AND FIND THE CRACK OF THE YEAR BOOK AND HE WOULD SAY, "I JUST SIGNED YOUR CRACK, HA HA HA HA ," SO I WOULD HAVE HAVE TO SIGN YOUR GUY'S YEAR BOOK DRAG. BUT I WOULD SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE CAST AND CREW FOR MAKING ME A BETTER PERSON AND ACTOR, AND I JUST SIGNED YOUR CRACK. SO... (LAUGHTER)
I'M GOING TO FIND IT VERY PAINFUL SO SAY GOODBYE TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM I WORKED IN THE THEATER ON THE SHOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I WILL SAY MEET AGAIN UNTIL WE WORK TOGETHER AGAIN BECAUSE THE NETWORK OF WORKING ACTORS, WE ALWAYS KEEP BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER AND YOU LIVE IN HOPE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE. SO I WILL JUST SAY, DOT, DOT, DOT, TO BE CONTINUED.

VERY OLD FOR THE 40-YEAR-OLDS.
Stephen: WHEN YOU'RE 92, YOU'RE LIKE, I'M IN MY EARLY 90s.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: (LAUGHTER) EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM THE SIMPSONS. YOU'RE A MASTER OF SO MANY DIFFERENT VOICES. DID YOU KNOW YOUR ENTIRE LIFE THAT YOU COULD DO THIS?
I HAVE BEEN MIMICKING EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER. I'VE SAID THIS MANY PLACES -- I THOUGHT EVERYBODY COULD DO THAT. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A MARKETABLE SKILL UNTIL I WAS A TEENAGER.
Stephen: BEFORE YOU WERE A TEENAGER, YOU WERE DOING THIS?
ALWAYS.
Stephen: WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON YOU WERE DOING AN IMPRESSION OF?
MOSTLY CARTOON CHARACTERS BUGS BUNNY WAS MY IDOL UNTIL I WAS 10. MEL BLANK, HE BECAME MY IDOLS. DO YOU REMEMBER THE TAPE RECORDERS.
Stephen: YES. YOU HAD TO PRESS PLAY AND RECORD LIKELY HARD?
Stephen: YEAH. I WOULD RECORD MYSELF AND REALLY ENTERTAIN MYSELF. MY IMPRESSIONS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THAT GOOD WHEN I WAS SEVEN, BUT --
Stephen: DO YOU STILL HAVE THESE TAPES?
I WISH. NO, I DON'T.
Stephen: YOUR MOM DIDN'T KEEP THEM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
NO.
Stephen: DID YOUR MOM LIKE YOUR IMPRESSIONS?
NO, SHE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT FUNNY AT THE TIME. MY MOTHER WAS VERY DISMISSIVE. LIKE, AH, VERY FUNNY, TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOUR MOM SOUNDS LIKE MOE. (LAUGHTER)
A LITTLE BIT. MY MOTHER'S MORE HERE, AND MOE IS LIKE IF SHE SMOKED A LOT. (LAUGHTER)
Stephen: YOU DID AN IMPRESSION OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
I DID. WE'RE REALLY TRASHING MY MOM TONIGHT, AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE. MY FATHER'S MOTHER WHO MY MOM DID NOT GET ALONG WITH TREMENDOUSLY WELL, SHE SOUNDED LIKE THIS -- HELLO BABY, HELLO HONEY, I LOVE YOU, HONEY. AND SHE USED TO SHOW UP A LOT UNANNOUNCED WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE MY MOM NOT LOVE HER TO DEATH. SO MY MOTHER WOULD COME HOME AFTER I WOULD GET HOME FROM SCHOOL AND I WOULD SAY, HEY, MOMMA, GUESS WHO I RAN INTO DOWNSTAIRS, AND I WOULD GO TO THE OTHER ROOM, HELLO, HONEY! I LOVE YOU, HONEY! THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE PAUSE AND I COULD TELL MY MOM WAS GOING, OH, GOD! HI, HI! AND SHE WOULD COME IN AND SEE IT WAS JUST ME, AND -- (LAUGHTER) YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
Stephen: AS LONG AS WE'RE GOING TO OVER ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU HAVE COMING UP HERE.
I HAVE OTHER JOBS, TOO.

I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ALL TALK LIKE THIS, BUT THEY DO -- (LAUGHTER) AND THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO CALL YOU BY YOUR FULL NAME, STEPHEN COLBERT... > Stephen: YOU DI YOU DID A SKIT ABOUT HIM CALLING A GAME AFTER HIS WIFE WAS FOUND HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN ON THEIR KITCHEN FLOOR.
THAT WAS NOT FUNNY, BUT THIS IS A LITTLE FUNNY, THIS IS A MAN WHO WOULD PREPARE FOR A BROADCAST BY HAVING TWO SHOTS OF RYE WHISKEY, AND THAT DIE AFTER SEEING THAT, HE HAD ABOUT 19 SHOTS OF RYE WHISKEY AND STARTED SAYING WHATEVER OCCURRED TO HIM. HIS HOME RUN CALL BECAME, HIT TO RIGHT CENTER FIELD, I CAN'T SEE THE BALL. IT'S EITHER OUT OF HERE OR LOST INSIDE MY WIFE'S BIG FAT CHEATIN' (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER)

THANKS. GREAT FOR YOU TO HAVE ME ON.
Stephen: FOUNDER AND STILL C.E.O.
STILL CHAIRMAN.
Stephen: OF NIKE, A $30 BILLION A YEAR COMPANY BUT FROM VERY HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, THIS COMPANY.
VERY.
Stephen: HOW DID IT BEGIN? HOW MANY YEARS NOW HAS IT BEEN AROUND?
WELL, IT STARTED ON THE RUNNING TRACK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON WHERE MY OLD -- YEAH, WHERE MY OLD TRACK COACH WAS ALWAYS EXPERIMENTING WITH SHOES. I WAS A DISTANCE RUNNER. HE EXPERIMENTED WITH DIFFERENT SHOES. THEY HAD A LOT OF GOOD RUNNERS AND HE HAD ME. HE EXPERIMENTED WITH ME.
Stephen: BECAUSE YOU WERE NO GREAT LOSS.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SCREW UP THE GOOD GUYS. THAT PLANTED A SEED. I WENT ON TO THE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AT STANFORD AND TOOK A CLASS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND WROTE A PAPER THAT THE U.S. SHOE MARKET WAS DOMINATED BY GERMAN SHOE COMPANIES. DIDN'T MAKE SINCE TO ME THEY MADE SHOES IN GERMANY. I THOUGHT WHY NOT IN JAPAN LIKE THE CAMERA BUSINESS. SO I WENT TO JAPAN TO CALL ON A SHOE COMPANY. I PLACED AN ORDER FOR SAMPLES AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING.
Stephen: WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD IS THE ORIGINAL WAFFLE SHOE IS HERE. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS NIKE SHOE HERE?
THIS PUT NIKE ON THE MAP.
Stephen: WHO THE QUESTION SIGNED THE SWOOSH?
A GASK ARTIST AT PORTSLAND STATE UNIVERSITY. WE PAID HER $2 AN HOUR. IT'S BEEN EASILY WORTH IT. BUT WHEN WE WENT PUBLIC, WE GAVE HER 500 SHARES OF STOCK, AND SHE HASN'T SOLD A SINGLE SHARE AND THEY'RE NOW WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS.
Stephen: OH, THAT'S GREAT. (APPLAUSE) WHEN YOU SAY WAFFLE, IT WAS LITERALLY MADE IN A WAFFLE, RIGHT?
WE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE TRACK COACH THAT BECAME MY PARTNER AND SAID THE RUNNER SHOE HASN'T HAD A NEW OUTER SOLE IN 50 YEARS. HE WAS THINKING ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS DRIVING BACK AND HIS WIFE WAS MAKING WAFFLES AND THAT WAS THE START OF THE SOLE. JUST THIS LAST YEAR THE INTERNATIONAL INVENTORS HALL OF FAME MADE THEM A MEMBER OF THEIR HALL OF FAME FOR THE WAFFLE SOLE.
Stephen: WELL, YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "SHOE DOG." WHAT'S A SHOE DOG?
WHEN I GOT IN THE BUSINESS A SHOE DOG IS BASICALLY A SHOEMAKER, AND THEY HAD A --
Stephen: NOT A COB SNRER. NO, BUT THE SHOE DOGS WENT THROUGH THE GENERATIONS AND THEY HAD A WAY -- THEY FIGURED OUT NORMAL HUMAN BEING LIFE EXPECTANCY WILL WALK 275 MILLION STEPS AND THE SHOEMAKERS WERE PART OF THEIR JOURNEY AND PART OF THEIR HUMANITY, AND I ALWAYS SORT OF LIKED THAT STORY AND BECAME PART OF THAT BUSINESS AND CONSIDERED MYSELF A SHOE DOG.
Stephen: NIKE DOESN'T JUST MAKE SHOES AND OTHER APPAREL, IT ALSO MAKES STARS BECAUSE YOU WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO PARTNER WITH SOMEONE, LIKE MICHAEL JORDAN, SEEN HERE IN THE ORIGINAL AIR JORDANS, WHICH WE HAVE RIGHT THERE. THE ORIGINAL AIR JORDANS.
THE GOOD LUCK WAS THAT DAVID STERN BANNED THE COLOR RED ON SHOES. THEY HAD TO BE WHITE OR BLACK IN THE N.B.A., SO WE RAN AN AD THAT SAID BANNED IN THE N.B.A. AND THE SALES TOOK RIGHT OFF.
Stephen: YEAH, WELL, JOHN OVER THERE HAS A PAIR ON TONIGHT, RIGHT NOW. THE YELLOW AND BLUE. STILL POPULAR.
YOU LOOK GREAT, JOHN.
Stephen: I HAVE NOT OPENED THIS YET BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE IS A SPECIAL PAIR OF NIEBLGIES IN THERE.
YES, SIR. BASICALLY, WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING NO OTHER GUEST COULD GIVE YOU. SO WE HAVE THIS PAIR OF SHOES THAT IS THE LIFE OF STEPHEN COLBERT IN A PAIR OF SHOES.
Stephen: MM-HMM. BASICALLY, WE START WITH A SACK THAT SAYS 1964 WHICH IS THE FIRST YEAR WE HAD ANY SALES FOR OUR COMPANY AND WAS ALSO MEANINGFUL TO YOU.
