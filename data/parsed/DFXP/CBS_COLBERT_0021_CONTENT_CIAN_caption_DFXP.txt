I HAD TO GET THERE BEFORE 10:30 TO GET MY MEAT AND MY CHEESE ON A MUFFIN BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME, WHAT THEN? MEAT AND CHEESE ON A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TYPE OF BREAD? THAT'S NO WAY TO START YOUR DAY. BUT NOW, WITH AN EGG McMUFFIN AVAILABLE AT ANY TIME? IT'S CHAOS. TEAR UP YOUR HISTORY BOOKS, AND LIVE IN A CAVE. NOTHING MEANS ANYTHING ANYMORE.

Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. HEY, FOLKS, I WENT OUT AND SAW THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE IN AMERICA THIS WEEKEND, "THE MARTIAN." IT'S THE SCI-FI THRILLER THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE NEAR FUTURE WHERE -- HERE'S THE TWIST: NASA HAS A BUDGET. I LOVED IT. IT MIGHT GO DOWN AS THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME ABOUT A STRANDED MAN EATING HIS OWN POOP POTATOES. AND I WASN'T ALONE IN LOVING IT, FOLKS. EVERYBODY SAW THIS THING. IT PULLED IN $100 MILLION IN ITS OPENING WEEKEND. AND $2 MILLION OF THAT WAS JUST FROM ME BUYING POPCORN AND JUNIOR MINTS. AND THIS MOVIE'S BLOCK IS ONLY GONNA GET MORE BUSTED, BECAUSE "THE MARTIAN" IS EXPECTED TO DO "PARTICULARLY WELL WHEN IT LAUNCHES IN CHINA. THE COUNTRY'S SPACE PROGRAM PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE FILM, A PLOT POINT THAT SHOULD HELP IT ATTRACT CROWDS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC." OH, NO, SPOILERS! DON'T TELL ME THE PLOT POINT. I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT MAKES SENSE THAT "THE MARTIAN" WOULD INCLUDE A PRO-CHINESE PLOT POINT BECAUSE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ONLY ALLOWS A SMALL NUMBER OF FOREIGN MOVIES INTO CHINA EACH YEAR, AND AFTER AMERICA, CHINA IS THE NUMBER TWO BIGGEST MOVIE-GOING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AND THIS MOVIE IS A NATURAL MATCH FOR CHINA. BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS THE PLANET MARS RED. I BELIEVE IT HAS MORE OXYGEN THAN BEIJING. ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT'S ONLY NATURAL-- PEOPLE ARE APPLAUDING FOR OXYGEN. SO IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR AMERICAN MOVIEMAKERS TO TRY TO PLEASE THE CULTURAL GATEKEEPERS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS. IN THE DISASTER MOVIE "2012," HUMANITY IS SAVED BECAUSE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAD THE FORESIGHT TO BUILD LIFESAVING ARKS. AND IN "GRAVITY," SANDRA BULLOCK SURVIVES BY GETTING HERSELF TO THE CHINESE SPACE STATION. THAT MOVIE DID SO WELL IN CHINA, SHE WENT BACK AND RESHOT "THE BLINDSIDE" WITH AN UNDERPRIVILEGED TABLE TENNIS PLAYER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, FOLKS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I'M IN SHOWBIZ, TOO. AND CLEARLY THE FUTURE IS GETTING THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW YOU INTO THEIR MARKET. AND I AM WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET A PIECE OF THAT SWEET... AND SOUR RENMINBI. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S PANDER EXPRESS! ♪ ♪ ♪ HE SEEMS PERFECTLY HAPPY. NI HAO, AND WELCOME TO PANDER EXPRESS, MY LONG-RUNNING, FIRST ATTEMPT TO SUCK UP TO CHINESE CENSORS BECAUSE NO OTHER LATE NIGHT HOST WILL HONOR YOUR GREAT CULTURE LIKE I DO. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE COMPASS, WHICH WAS INVENTED DURING THE HAN DYNASTY. IT HAS AIDED IN MARITIME NAVIGATION, DIVINED AUSPICIOUS LOCATIONS FOR BUILDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FENG SHUI, AND CAN BE USED TO EAT SOUP. CAN YOU EAT SOUP WITH THIS WESTERN COMPASS? NOT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO SATISFY THE DECADENT AMERICANS! ( LAUGHTER ) AND, FOLKS, DON'T GET ME STARTED ON MOVABLE BLOCK TYPE AND GUNPOWERED. SO MANY GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS, ALL DESPITE THE VILLANOUS INTERFERENCE OF THE DALAI LAMA. ONE LOOK AT HIS CRUEL SMILE IS ENOUGH TO PUT YOU OFF YOUR SPICY AND TINGLY LAMB FACE SALAD. MMMM. MMMM. THAT IS FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) IT'S THE MEAL THAT CHOOSE YOU BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW LET'S TARGET THE KEY DEMOGRAPHIC. I'D LIKE TO TALK DIRECTLY TO CHINESE MILLENIALS. 'SUP, GUYS? ( LAUGHTER ) PARENTS, AM I RIGHT? THEY TRULY DESERVE OUR REVERANCE. TWEET ME WITH HASHTAG-FILIAL-PIETY-IS-THE- CHIEF-OF-ALLVIRTUES. AND WE'LL BE READING THOSE TWEETS SOME DAY, IF TWITTER IS EVER ALLOWED IN YOUR COUNTRY. AND LIKE THE MAKERS OF THE MOVIE "THE MARTIAN," I WANT TO CONGRATULATE CHINA ON ITS WORLD-LEADING SPACE PROGRAM. YOUR SCIENTISTS RECENTLY DISCOVERED A BLACK HOLE SO LARGE IT HAS CHALLENGED HUMANITY'S UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY FORM. AND YET, IT WOULD STILL BE EASIER TO ESCAPE THAN AMERICA'S DEBT TO CHINA.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Stephen: YES, SIR?
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.
AND I'M GLAD YOU'VE GOT SUCH GOOD STUDIO MUSIC.
Stephen: AREN'T THEY GREAT?
I MET MR. BATISTE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND I MET HIS FAMILY IN NEW ORLEANS.
Stephen: HE DID NOT TELL ME.
HEY! WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME.
LOOK, I KNEW-- A THE LOVE THINGS YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME.
Stephen: NO. I SAVE IT FOR AIR. ( LAUGHTER ) I KNEW THAT YOU WERE A DEVOUT CATHOLIC.
Stephen: I'M A CATHOLIC. I DON'T KNOW HOW DEVOUT I AM. BUT THANK YOU.
AND I KNOW YOU MUST LOVE THIS POPE, AND I DO, TOO, BECAUSE I WENT TO A JESUIT UNIVERSITY.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: SURE.
BUT I BET EVEN HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN STAINED GLASS WINDOWS.
Stephen: NO, HE HAS TO WAIT UNTIL HE DIES TO GET THAT.
HE MAY PUT HIS PICTURE IN THE DOME OF ST. PETER'S NOW.
Stephen: YES, THIS IS VERY NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU-- DID YOU GET ANY TIME WITH HIM? DID YOU GET ANY TIME WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS IN AMERICA?
NO.
Stephen: NEITHER DID I.
YOU'RE JUST KIND OF SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL WITH ME TONIGHT.
Stephen: I HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU'RE MY FIRST PRESIDENT TO BE HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ON MY SHOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. , OF COURSE, NOW, NOW YOUR BIG WORK IS THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE. YOU GUYS JUST HAD YOUR BIG MEETING. WHAT ARE YOU INITIATING NOW? WHAT'S THE NEXT PLAN?
IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING MEETING. WE HAD, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE WAS THERE UPON THE PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY. THE PRIME MINISTER OF GREECE. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE REFUGEE PROBLEMS IN SYRIA AND SPILLING OVER INTO JORDAN AND LEBANON. AND WE HAD SOME REALLY INTERESTING COMMITMENTS. NESTLE IS DOING SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE. THEY'RE HELPING 7500 FARMERS IN AFRICA TO PRODUCE A VITAMIN-ENRICHED PRODUCT. AND I DO A LOT OF WORK NOW WITH MY FOUNDATION, SEPARATE FROM THE GLOBAL INITIATIVE, ON HELPING MEAS LITTLE FARMERS. AND IT'S KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY IN THE DEPRESSION. YOU KNOW, YOU GET A BETTER SEED, FERTILIZER, AND GET THEIR FOOD-- THEIR CROP TO MARKET FOR FREE. AND WE'VE INCREASED THEIR INCOMES THREE, FOUR, FIVE TIMES. PEOPLE LIVING ON AN ACRE OF LAND, AND SO WE'RE DOING THAT. BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD COMMITMENTS. WE STARTED OFF ACTUALLY WITH THE UNITED NATIONS JUST PROMULGATED THESE NEW SUSTAINABLE GOALS, YOU KNOW, DEVELOPMENT GOALS. AND THEY ASKED US TO BE THEIR FIRST PARTNER THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED THE CLINTON'S ENTERPRISE PARTNERSHIP TO TRY TO TAKE 100 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS BY DISTRIBUTING WHAT WE DISTRIBUTE NOW-- CONSUMER GOODS TO REMOTE POOR PEOPLE, PLACES PEOPLE LIVING IN, VERY POOR PLACES. AND TO ADD CLEAN-COOK STOVES, CLEAN WATER, AND SANITATION. AND NOBODY KNOWS IF WE CAN DO IT, BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE DO IT.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT-- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG-- ONE OF THE THINGS THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS ABLE TO DO IS THEY CREATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH BOTH GOVERNMENTS AND CORPORATION AROUND THE WORLD TO TRY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS.
YEAH.
Stephen: THE DEMOCRATS OFTEN GET CRITICIZED BY SAYING, "OH, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THINGS." NOW THAT YOU HAVE LEFT OFFICE AND ARE WORKING WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, DO YOU THINK A PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN LARGE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS?
WELL, IT CAN BE. BUT YOU REALLY NEED A STRONG EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS PART. FOR EXAMPLE, WE NEED MORE PUBLIC HEALTH CLINICS IN AMERICA TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE A LONG WAY FROM AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. BUT IF THE HEALTH CARE BILL HADN'T PASSED WITH THE MEDICARE EXPANSION AND SUBSIDIES FOR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE TO BUY INSURANCE OVER THE EXCHANGE, THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO FUNDING STREAM FOR THESE CLINICS. SO THE BEST THING THAT WORKS IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER. ONCE IN A WHILE WE DO SOMETHING WITH NO GOVERNMENT AT ALL. LAST YEAR WE STARTED OFF THE C.G.I., SP 100 TONS OF RELIEF TO THE EBOLA COUNTRIES, SENDING THEM THEIR MEDICAL SUPPLIES. AND WE WOIPPED UP DOING 500 TONS WITH NO GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT, JUST 24 PARTNERS.  ( APPLAUSE ) IT WAS THE BIGGEST-- BUT, BUT THAT WAS AN EMERGENCY. IF-- LET'S TAKE RWANDA. I WANT TO DO IN THESE EBOLA COUNTRIES, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN RWANDA IS BUILD OUT THEIR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS SO THEY DON'T NEED ANYBODY ELSE ANYMORE. YOU TRAIN PEOPLE AND THEY CAN RUN THEIR OWN SYSTEM. AND WE DON'T TAKE ANY MONEY FROM THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT BUT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT STARTED FUNDING THIS WHEN HILLARY WAS STILL IN OFFICE, AND THEY'RE TRAINING PEOPLE WITH 23 AMERICAN PARTNERS, INCLUDING 10 MEDICAL SCHOOLS, SIX NURSING SCHOOLS, AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE AND A BUNCH OF HOSPITALS. THEY'RE DOING IT ALL FOR 7% OVERHEAD. IT'S THE LEAST-EXPENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WE'VE EVER UNDERTAKEN, WHICH MEAN PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE, THEIR TAX DOLLARS GO FURTHER.
Stephen: YOU WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS AND GOVERNMENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD, ALSO CORPORATIONS. DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE THERE'S SO LITTLE TRUST OF OUR GOVERNMENT NOW. THERE'S SO LITTLE SENSE THAT WASHINGTON CAN GET ANYTHING DONE. SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO THERE WITH THE INTENTION OF GETTING NOTHING DONE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT IS THE RB PROBLEM.
AND GET REWARDED FOR IT AT ELECTION TIME.
Stephen: EXACTLY, EXACTLY. IF THE UNITED STATES-- OR IF THE ENTIRE WORLD, LET'S SAY, WERE IN DANGER. IF THE ALIENS HAD A CRAFT RIGHT OVER THE NORTH POLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO INCINERATE THE PLANET. WE HAVE TO SEND SOMEBODY UP TO SAY, "HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULDN'T WIPE OUT HUMAPT. HERE'S WHY WE'RE WORTH HAVING HOPE IN." AND WE SENT YOU UP, WHAT WOULD Y TO THE ALIEN ALIENS TO JUSTIFY OUR EXISTENCE? ( APPLAUSE ) NO PRESSURE. NO PRESSURE, SIR.
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN ENCOUNTER I'VE HAD MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S WHAT I-- I WOULD SAY WHAT THE GREAT MICROBIOLOGIST WILSON SAID IN HIS BOOK "THE SOCIAL CONQUEST OF EARTH." I'D SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF US BECAUSE OF ALL THE SPECIES THAT HAVE EVER LIVE IN SPITE OF OUR BULL HEADEDNESS WE ARE THE GREAT COOPERATORS. WE ARE LIVING IN A PLANET AND INCREASINGLY A UNIVERSE THAT IS IS INTERDEPENDENT AND WE HAVE TO DO THIS STUFF TOGETHER. WE'RE YOUR BEST CHANCE ON EARTH. IF YOU WIPE US OUT, WHAT YOU ARE YOU GOING TO DO IF YOU GET HIT BY AN ASTEROID. THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IF YOU CAN JUST HANG OUT FOR A SECOND. WE'RE GOING TO DO A COMMERCIAL BUT I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION. YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME OPINIONS ON THAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN A FEW MINUTES WITH PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. ( APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, 2016 ELECTION IS QUICKLY COMING UPON US. WHO DO YOU LIKE FOR 2016? ( LAUGHTER ) AND, PLEASE, TRY TO BE IMPARTIAL HERE. WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST QUALIFIED TO HOLD OFFICE IN 2016?
THE LADY I SAW SINGING ON "IS THE NIGHT LIVE."
Stephen: SHE WAS VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. THAT VAL WOMAN WAS WONDERFUL.
YEAH.
Stephen: SHE WAS REALLY WONDERFUL.
MADE MEANTIME TO TAKE A DRINK WITH HER.
Stephen: NOW THE CHANCES THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE ARE VERY REMOTE IN 2016. IF WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND A REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE STILL HAVE A DEMOCRAT, FOR INSTANCE LET'S SAY MRS.  CLINTON, IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WON'T WE STILL HAVE GRIDLOCK? IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE SAID FOR ONE PARTY HOLDING ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT SO AT LEAST SOMETHING CAN GET DONE? BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS MOST FRUSTRATING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS WASHINGTON JUST SITS THERE AND SINKS.
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS THAT GETS DONE.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW, LOOK, WHEN THE SECOND PRESIDENT BUSH CAME IN OFFICE FOR THE FIRST SIX YEARS, HE HAD A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS AND HE WAS THERE, AND THEY WENT BACK TO TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS. WE DOUBLED THE DEBT OF THE COUNTRY. MEDIAN INCOME WAS LOWER THAN THE DAY I LEFT OFFICE, EVEN BEFORE THE FINANCIAL CRASH AND YOU KNOW THE REST. SO IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU THINK THAT WAS GOOD OR NOT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) NO, NO. LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS NEXT ELECTION, SOMETHING NOBODY HAS REALLY STARTED TALKING ABOUT IS I THINK THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL MAKE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE APPOINTMENTS TO THE SUPREME COURT.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND IT'S A ONE-VOTE SUPREME COURT, "ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. YOU'VE JUST GOT TO DECIDE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO YOU. BUT I THINK THAT-- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE GRIDLOCK IS THAT THE-- OUR PARTY HAS-- THE DEMOCRATS-- WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ONLY VOTE IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THE NONPRESIDENTIAL YEARS ARE. THAT'S WHEN ALL THE SHOWS VOTED ON, A THIRD OF THE SENATE, MOST OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS, AND MOST OF THE GOVERNORS, AND THEY RESTRICT THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. SO THE REPUBLICANS, I FEEL SORT OF BAD FOR THEM. JOHN BOEHNER CAMPAIGNED FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT GAVE HIM SO MUCH GRIEF, BUT THEY'RE IN DISTRICTS NOW THAT THEY HAVE REAPPORTIONED SO THAT THEY'RE FAR MORE IN DANGER OF BEING BUMPED OFF IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR BEING TOO MODERATE THAN THEY ARE LOSING A GENERAL ELECTION FOR BEING TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT. AND WE, OUR SIDE, HAS TO OWN SOME RESPONSIBILITY. WE'VE GOT TO VOTE EVERY TIME THEY OPEN THE DOOR, NOT JUST ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS, AND IF WE DID THAT, YES, THERE WOULD BE SOME MORE DEMOCRATS, BUT THE MAIN THING IS THE REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN HAVING CREATIVE COMPROMISE. WE'VE ALL GOT TO SHOULDER OUR RESPONSIBILITY. YOU KNOW, HILLARY WANTS TO LIMIT THESE COMMITTEES, LIKE YOU SET UP FOUR YEARS AGO. YOURS WAS A JOKE. BUT THE IDEA THAT WE CAN HAVE ALL THESE ANONYMOUS DONORS SPEND MONEY ON ELECTIONS --
Stephen: IT WAS A JOKE WITH $1.4 MILLION, SIR. IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL JOKE, A VERY POWERFUL JOKE.
BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. EVEN IF WE TRY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION. I MEAN, IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS THE SAME FOR A BILLIONAIRE AS IT IS FOR A MINIMUM-WAGE WORKER. THE GREAT FRENCH WRITER VICTOR HUGO ONCE SAID HE LIVED IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE RICH AND POOR WERE EQUALLY FREE TO SLEEP UNDER THE BRIDGE AT NIGHT. AND THAT'S LIKE SAYING THE RICH AND POOR ARE EQUALLY FREE TO SPEND $1 BILLION ON A SECRET ELECTION. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THE PRESIDENT-- PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2012 CAMPAIGN CALLED YOU SECRETARY OF EXPLAINING STUFF. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THREE THINGS TO ME VERY QUICKLY. I KNOW "QUICK" IS A TOUGH WORD SOMETIMES. THE FIRST ONE IS WHY DO YOU THINK BERNIE SANDERS IS DOING SO WELL?
BECAUSE THERE ARE A THE LOVE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT ARE REALLY HACKED OFF THAT THEY THINK THE SYSTEM'S RIGGED AGAINST THEM AND THE RICH GET ALL THE GAINS. AND IN AMERICA, A LOT OF THEM BELIEVE THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN REWARDED FOR-- THEY REWARD THE PEOPLE THAT GO THE FURTHEST TO THE RIGHT. SO THE DEMOCRATS WOULD BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE IF THEY MOVED FURTHER TO THE LEFT.
Stephen: WHY DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS DOING SO WELL?
BECAUSE HE'S A MASTER BRANDER, AND HE'S THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTER OUT THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BECAUSE HE SAYS SOMETHING THAT OVERRIDES THE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST DEBATE, A LOT OF THOSE GUYS WERE COMPETING FOR WHO COULD BE THE MOST POLITICAL PLEA CORRECT ON THE ANSWERS. TRUMP SAID I SUPPORTED DEMOCRATS, I SUPPORTED REPUBLICAN REPUBLICANS. YEAH, I WAS FRIENDS WITH BILL CLINTON. WHO CARES. I RUN THINGS AND I BUILD THING AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO WILL GO IN THERE AND FIX IT, AND IF THEY DON'T FIX IT I'LL GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY. HE MAY HAVE A SHORT SHELF LIFE. HE IS A MASTER BRANDER AND MACHO APPEAL OF SAYING I'M JUST SICK OF NOTHING HAPPENING. I MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. VOTE FOR ME.
Stephen: THE THIRD ONE IS THERE'S A RUMOR OUT THERE-- AND FEEL FREE TO DISPEL THIS-- DID YOU CALL DONALD TRUMP AND ASK HIM TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
NO.  ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NO? BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PRETTY SMART, MAN.
YEAH. YEAH. I GET CREDIT FOR DOING A LOT OF THINGS I DIDN'T DO LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: CREDIT, CREDIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HIS DAUGHTER TOLD MY DAUGHTER THAT HE HAD TRIED TO CALL ME AND I DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE. SO I SIMPLY CALLED HIM BACK. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE HAD EVER INTENDED TO DISCUSS THIS WITH ME OR NOT, AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU BEFORE, I BET. I THINK BY THE TIME I GOT HIM BACK HE HAD FORGOTTEN WHY HE CALLED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.
Stephen: YOU NEVER SAID, "IOWA IS BEAUTIFUL THIS TIME OF YEAR," OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? NOTHING LIKE THAT?
I HAD A VERY PLEASANT CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND IT WASN'T ABOUT RUNNING FOR OFFICE. SO I MISSED A CHANCE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, I HOPE YOU DON'T MISS THE CHANCE TO COME BACK AGAIN. THIS WAS A PLEASURE AND AN HONOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.

THE SMOKELESS DRAGON. E-CIGARETTES HEAT NICOTINE- INFUSED LIQUID INTO INHALABLE STEAM. WHICH GIVES A QUICK BUZZ AND GETS ALL THE WRINKLES OUT OF YOUR LUNGS. AND VAPING HAS CAUGHT FIRE, WITH RECENT POLLS SHOWING AN ESTIMATED 10% OF U.S. ADULTS NOW VAPE. AND JUST LAST YEAR, GLOBAL SALES OF VAPOR DEVICES BROKE $6 BILLION. $6 BHL IS MORE MONEY THAN ALL THE TRANSFORMER MOVIES COMBINED. BY THE WAY, THE LONG-TERM HEALTH RISK OF WATCHING ALL THE TRANSFORMER MOVIES HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. BEST OF ALL, VAPING CAN MAKE YOU FEEL YOUNG BECAUSE E-CIGARETTE MAKERS ARE ALLOWED TO ADVERTISE TO ANYONE ON TV, WHICH HAS LED TO ADS LIKE THIS ONE FOR JUUL VAPOR. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH! YEAH! SOMETHING ABOUT INHALING POISON STEAM JUST MAKES ME WANT TO DANCE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE MUCH LUNG STRENGTH.

COULD BE CANCER... COULD BE LASER VISION! NOW, PERSONALLY, I'VE NEVER VAIPPED. ALCOHOL HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY PREFERRED METHOD FOR GETTING A HEADACHE AND THROWING UP.
