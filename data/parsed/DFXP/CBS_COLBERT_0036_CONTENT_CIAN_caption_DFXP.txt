STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." THANK YOU! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT AND ALSO WITH YOU." IT'S TUESDAY, OR AS I CALL IT, MONDAY TO WEDNESDAY HUMP DAY. EVERYONE ENJOY THE WEATHER TODAY? WAS THAT ENJOYABLE? THESE NICE PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE MOST OF THE DAY. BEAUTIFUL FALL DAY HERE IN NEW YORK. PERFECT DAY TO RAKE THE SIDEWALK AND LET THE KIDS JUMP INTO THAT BIG PILE OF TRASH. I LIKE FALL BECAUSE IT'S A TIME OF NEW BEGINNINGINGS. IN FACT, YESTERDAY PAUL RYAN STARTED HIS FIRST WEEK AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. BUT-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- HE CAN'T USE HIS NEW OFFICE YET BECAUSE JOHN BOEHNER WAS SUCH A HEAVY SMOKER THAT IT SMELLS LIKE AN OFF-TRACK BETTING PARLOR IN THERE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S GOT THE SAME MIXTURE OF CIGARETTES AND OLD MAN TEARS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: HE LET IT MARINATE, DIDN'T HE?
Stephen: THEY HAVE TO BRING IN THE TEAM FROM SERVE PRO. BUT I LOVE AUTUMN BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC TIME OF THE YEAR. AND THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE IN AUTUMN IS NEW YORK CITY. YOU WATCH ANY MOVIE, YOU WATCH ANY MOVIE, YOU KNOW THAT THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC OF HUNKY GUYS WALKING MULTIPLE DOGS BUMPING INTO CUTE GIRLS CARRYING AN ARMFUL OF VINTAGE BOOKS. YOU COULD GET TRAMPLED. BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. I THINK THE REASON FALL IS SO ROMANTIC, IS GOES BACK TO WHEN WE WERE ALL IN SCHOOL. A NEW SCHOOL YEAR BRINGS NEW HOPE. EVERY FALL YOU THINK, "MAYBE THIS IS THE YEAR A NEW KID COMES TO SCHOOL WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT MY PLACE IN THE SOCIAL PECKING ORDER IS. MAYBE THEY'LL THINK I'M SO COOL THAT I CHOSE TO SIT ALL ALONE AT LUNCH. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH THE ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE. I PREFER TO WEEP INTO MY PIZZA SQUARE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE AT MY TABLE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW I'LL BE TALKING TO ACCLAIMED ACTOR ANTONIO BANDERAS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S MY BANDARAS. HIS NEW FILM TELLS THE STORY OF THE 33 CHILEAN MINERS WHO WERE TRAPPED UNDERGROUND FOR MONTHS. IT'LL MAKE YOU THINK TWICE ABOUT SETTING UP YOUR "MAN CAVE." ( LAUGHTER ) THEN I'LL INTERVIEW THE C.E.O. OF NETFLIX, REED HASTINGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU THINK WHAT, I'LL EVEN LET YOU BORROW MY PASSWORD SO YOU CAN SEE IT. YOU CAN WATCH THE INTERVIEW ONE MINUTE AT A TIME OR I LIKE TO BINGE WATCH ALL SIX MINUTES AT ONCE. AND WE'LL ALSO HAVE NOVELIST AND ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING SCREENWRITER JOHN IRVING. HE IS HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, THAT'S NICE. HE'S HERE TO PROMOTE HIS NEW NOVEL, "AVENUE OF MYSTERIES." AND TO BOOST HIS SALES, I'M GOING TO CALL IT "HARRY POTTER AND THE AVENUE OF MYSTERIES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ YOU HEAR THAT? I HEARD THAT. I HEARD THAT, AND I'M DEAF IN ONE EAR. THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK THINGS OFF, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: TODAY, OHIO VOTED ON WHETHER TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA. SO IF YOU'RE A MARIJUANA SUPPORTER IN OHIO, TODAY WAS THE DAY YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ANTONIO BANDERAS. NETFLIX C.E.O. REED HASTINGS. AND AUTHOR JOHN IRVING. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT!" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS, EVERYBODY.  ( CHEERS ) THAT'S NICE. I DON'T HOW YOUNG SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE ARE. IT LOOKS LIKE SOME PRETTY YOUNG FACES OUT THERE. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, WE WERE IN A COLD WAR WITH RUSSIA. ANY MOMENT, ANY FALSE MOVE COULD MEAN TOTAL THERMONUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON, THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH TURNED INTO A GLOWIN ARBTRAY, ALL LIFE SNUFFED OUT, IS WHAT I TOLD THE GIRLD WHO WOULDN'T DATE ME. AND YET, THERE WAS NO WARMING OF RELATIONS. THAT'S WHY, TO THIS DAY, I STILL DON'T TRUST RUSSIA, ESPECIALLY UNDER VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE'S A RUTHLESS DICTATOR WHO WANTS TO DESTROY AMERICA. PLEASE COME ON THE SHOW, IT'S SWEEPS. BRING THE KITTY CAT, TOO. NOW, THANKS TO VLAD, TENSIONS WITH RUSSIA ARE ON THE RISE AGAIN. FIRST, HE INVADED UKRAINE, THEN HE SENT WARPLANES INTO SYRIA, AND NOW RUSSIA IS ATTACKING SOMEPLACE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT: THE INTERNET.
COULD RUSSIA BE PLANNING AN ATTACK ON UNDERSEA CABLES THAT CONNECT GLOBAL INTERNET?
RUSSIAN SPY SHIPS AND SUBMARINES LURKING NEAR UNDERSEA CABLES THAT CARRY ALMOST THE ENTIRE INTERNET.
Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THE INTERNET DOING UNDERWATER?! LAST TIME I CHECKED, I'M NOT SPEEZED TO GET MY COMPUTER WET. SECOND, IF YOU ASK ME HOW THE INTERNET TRAVELS FROM CONTINENT TO CONTINENT, I WOULD HAVE SAID SATTELITES OR LASERS OR HONESTLY, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE JUST SAID THE INTERNET. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CLOUD? I WAS TOLD THERE WAS A CLOUD. REMEMBER, "HEY, LET'S PUT IT IN THE CLOUD." IT WAS LIKE THE INTERNET WAS A VAPOR OF INFORMATION THAT CIRCLES THE EARTH AND YOUR COMPUTER WAS LIKE A LADLE THAT SCOOPED OUT WHAT YOU NEEDED? BUT THE INTERNET IS ACTUALLY UNDERWATER BECAUSE... THESE CABLES CARRY MORE THAN 95% OF DAILY INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS. AND U.S. INTELLIGENCE WORRIES THAT IN TIMES OF TENSION OR CONFLICT, RUSSIA MIGHT RESORT TO SEVERING THEM. IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST DISRUPTION TO YOUR INTERNET SERVICE SINCE YOUR UPSTAIRS NEIGHBOR PUTS A PASSWORD ON HIS WIFI. TRY HIS DOG'S NAME. I GOT A SERIOUS QUESTION. IF OUR ENEMIES CAN ATTACK OUR INTERNET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN, WHY DID WE PUT OSAMA BIN LADEN DOWN THERE? ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHEN THEY DECIDED TO PUT THE INTERNET TUBES UNDER THE SEA, DID EVERYONE FORGET THAT CRABS HAVE SCISSORS FOR HANDS? ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T-- AND IF THE RUSSIANS DO CUT THE INFORMATION PIPELINE, WE'D BE LOOKING AT A DEEP SEA INTERNET SPILL. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO SCRUB THAT DATA OFF THE PELICANS. AND RUSSIA ITSELF MIGHT NOT REALIZE THIS COULD HURT THEM, TOO. IF THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE INTERNET, HOW CAN WE ORDER THEIR BULK VODKA? OR THEIR RUSSIAN BRIDES? OR THEIR IMITATION BONER PILLS, WHICH WE NEED CUZ OF ALL THE VODKA WE DRANK BEFORE WE ORDERED THE RUSSIAN BRIDE. HERE'S A PRO TIP: THAT'S NOT HER BROTHER. DON'T LET YERGI MOVE IN WITH YOU. AND REPAIRING THOSE CABLES WILL BE A SLOW PROCESS, BECAUSE JUST IMAGINE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TIME WARNER TO SHOW UP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. YEAH, HELLO? YEAH, THEY'LL BE THERE-- YEAH, THEY'LL BE THERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NOON AND LOW TIDE. CLICK. ALL AMERICANS HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR A SURPRISE WEB ATTACK. SO TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO PACK AN INTERNET OUTAGE "GO BAG." I'M ALREADY WORKING ON MINE-- YOU WANT A DUFFLE BAG. YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE DUFFEL FIRST. AND YOU'RE GONNA FILL IT WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED FROM THE INTERNET, IN THE EVENT THE INTERNET NO LONGER EXISTS. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'LL LOSE ACCESS TO THE MILLIONS OF BABY PHOTOS YOUR FRIENDS KEEP POSTING ON FACEBOOK. SO TO BE PREPARED, MAKE SURE YOU PACK ONE BABY PHOTO BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST-- THEY ALL LIKE THE SAME, OKAY. LOVELY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOVELY. BUT BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, BALD AND CONFUSED. YOU COULD ALSO JUST PACK A PHOTO OF VIN DIESEL. AND, IN A PINCH, IN A PINCH, LEGALLY. AND TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THE COMPLETE INTERNET EXPERIENCE, PACK PRINT-OUTS OF NEARBY RESTAURANT REVIEWS. LET'S SEE, YOU WANT TO PUT IN LOCAL MOVIE TIMES, OKAY. AND IF I CAN FIND ANY, ALSO YOU WANT TO PRINT OUT A STACK OF RACIST TWEETS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND, WOW. THEY MANAGED TO MISSPELL K.K.K. ( LAUGHTER ) OF COURSE, WE'LL NO LONGER HAVE WIKIPEDIA, BUT I RECENTLY DISCOVERED SOMETHING CALLED ENCYCLO-PEDIA, WHICH IS EVEN KIND OF COOL. THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS, IT'S EVEN EASIER TO EDIT. PUT THOSE IN THERE. AND TO REPLACE YOUTUBE, YOU, OF COURSE,-- TO REPLACE YOUTUBE, YOU, OF COURSE, ARE GONNA WANT TO GET A CAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PREFERABLY ONE DRESSED IN A TUXEDO, OKAY, OKAY. IS IS TO GET THE FULL EFFECT, BEFORE YOU LOOK AT HIM, WATCH A 30-SECOND AD FOR OLD SPICE. GET IN THERE, BUDDY. GET IN. GET IN THERE. ZIP YOU UP. ZIP YOU UP. ( APPLAUSE ) AND-- AND-- AND I-- AND, HOLD ON. AND, THERE YOU GO. AND, OF COURSE, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A REPLACEMENT FOR NETFLIX. FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE "FAST AND FURIOUS" MOVIES, JUST PACK ONE TOY CAR AND ADD VIN DIESEL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) STICK AROUND. WE'VE GOT ANTONIO BANDERAS COMING UP. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME. FOLKS-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK TO MY DAD'S BARN. ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENERGY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENERGY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENTHUSIASM. I'M A LITTLE TIRED TONIGHT BECAUSE I WAS LATE LAST NIGHT ON THE INTERNET-- RUSSIANS HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO MINE YET. AND WHENEVER I GET ON THAT THING, IT JUST TURNS INTO A TIME-SUCKING SINKHOLE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. THIS MORNING, I WENT ONLINE JUST TO SEE IF IT'S GOING TO RAIN TOMORROW. SO I GOOGLE WEATHER, AND ONE OF THE RESULTS IS REGIONAL PRECIPITATION PATTERNS. SO I CLICKED ON THE LINK, AND I'M READING ABOUT HOW THE RAINIEST PLACE IN THE U.S. IS THE NAPALI COAST OF HAWAII, WHERE I LEARNED ON THE NAPALI WIKIPEDIA PAGE THE STRAWBERRY GUAVA IS AN INVASIVE SPECIES. WHICH, ACCORDING TO AN EXTERNAL LINK, IS NOT A CITRUS PLANT BUT DOES HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF VITAMIN C-- LESS THAN AN ORANGE BUT MORE THAN A GRAPEFRUIT, WHICH, WEBMD INFORMS ME, CAN BE BAD FOR PEOPLE WITH KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS BECAUSE THEY COUNTERACT THEIR IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MEDICATION. IT'S ALL TRUE. I LEARNED THIS ON THE INTERNET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE POINT IS IS-- WHEW! THE POINT IS, DOES ANYBODY KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO RAIN TOMORROW? BECAUSE I FORGOT TO FIND OUT. BUT WHENEVER I FIND A STRANGE NEW CORNER OF THE ONLINE-SCAPE, I LIKE TO FORWARD YOU THE LINK IN MY NEW SEGMENT, "STEPHEN COLBERT GAZES INTO THE INFI-NET." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) TODAY, WHEN I WAS INTERNETTING, A REDDIT THREAD BROUGHT ME TO AN IMAGUR PHOTO, WHERE A COMMENT BROUGHT ME TO A LOCAL ABC NEWS ARTICLE, WHICH BROUGHT ME TO MY NEW FAVORITE WEBSITE, coolserialsnumbers.com. THAT'S "COOL SERIAL NUMBERS DOT COM," NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH "HOT SERIAL NUMBERS DOT COM," WHICH IS A PORN SITE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AROUSED BY RANDOM STRINGS OF DIGITS. JIMMY, PLEASE, THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW. THANK YOU. coolserialsnumbers.com IS A SITE FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOY "COLLECTING U.S. CURRENCY WITH FANCY SERIAL NUMBERS." LIKE THIS ACTUAL EXAMPLE, A DOLLAR BILL WITH A RARE "SEVEN IN A ROW" SERIAL NUMBER-- SEVEN ZEROES AND A TWO-- WHICH IS LISTED AS WORTH $2,500. ONE DOLLAR BILL WORTH 2,500 BUCKS? IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE GENEROUS AT FLASH DANCERS THAN YOU THOUGHT. NOW, I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN YOU ARE NO LONGER LISTENING, BECAUSE YOU'RE RIFLING THROUGH EVERY BILL IN YOUR WALLET. WELL, KEEP LOOKING BECAUSE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF COLLECTIBLE SERIAL NUMBERS. LIKE A SEQUENCE COLLECTORS CALL "THE SOLID," WHERE EVERY DIGIT IS THE SAME. THE "DOUBLE QUAD," WHERE THE FIRST FOUR DIGITS ARE ALL THE SAME AND THE SECOND FOUR DIGITS ARE ALL THE SAME. AND THE "RADAR," WHERE THE NUMBER READS THE SAME LEFT-TO-RIGHT AS IT DOES RIGHT-TO-LEFT. WHICH MEANS YOU ONLY HAVE TO READ THE FIRST FOUR DIGITS TO KNOW HOW THE SERIAL NUMBER ENDS. THAT'S A TIME SAVER! TIME YOU COULD SPEND LOOKING AT OTHER SERIAL NUMBERS. AND I HAVE TO SAY, I HAD NO IDEA YOU COULD GET RICH COLLECTING MONEY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT I'M GLAD-- BUT I'M GLAD YOU CAN, BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT, I HAVE SOME EXTREMELY RARE CURRENCY THAT'S SURE TO BE WORTH A FORTUNE TO ANY COLLECTORS WHO ARE WATCHING TONIGHT. HERE, HERE IS A RARE DOLLAR BILL WHERE GEORGE WASHINGTON HAS AN EYE PATCH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M WILLING TO PART WITH IT FOR A MERE $1,000. IF IT SWEETENS THE POT, IF IT SWEETENS THE POT, HE COULD ALSO HAVE A MUSTACHE. THIS IS VERY SPECIAL. HERE'S A RARE DOLLAR BILL THAT WAS MISPRINTED. SEE HOW EVERYTHING'S UPSIDE DOWN? $3500. BOTH SIDES. LOOK, BOTH SIDES, BOTH SIDES, OKAY. AND THIS EXTREMELY UNIQUE $20 BILL HAS TWO DIFFERENT ANDREW JACKSONS ON IT. OKAY. HERE, HE'S HAPPY. AND HE'S SAD. AND HE'S HAPPY. HAPPY. SAD. ( APPLAUSE ) YOURS FOR JUST $1 MILLION! IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANY OF THESE, BILLS, FOLKS, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ANY OF THESE BILLS, GIVE ME A CALL AND HELP ME WITH MY OTHER HOBBY-- COLLECTING OTHER PEOPLE'S CREDIT CARD NUMBERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANTONIO BANDERAS. ( BAND PLAYING )
Stephen: YEAH! YEAH! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT HAS STARRED IN SUCH FILMS AS "PHILADELPHIA" ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) , "SHREK," AND "THE LEGEND OF ZORRO." HE NOW STARS IN THE "THE 33", THE STORY OF THE CHILEAN MINERS WHO WERE TRAPPED UNDERGROUND FOR 69 DAYS.
THEY'LL WAIT THREE DAYS.
NO, NO, NO, NO! I DON'T BELIEVE THAT! THEY DIG US OUT! AND IF THEY DON'T, OUR FAMILIES WILL! WITH THEIR BARE HANDS IF IT'S NECESSARY! I BELIEVE WE'LL MAKE IT OUT OF HERE BECAUSE I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IT! ALL 33 OF US!
Stephen: YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLEASE WELCOME ANTONIO BANDERAS. ♪ ANTONIO ANTONIO ANTONIO. ♪ ANTONIO ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: BEAUTIFUL, HUH?
SPECTACULAR.
Stephen: I LIKE THAT. SO FEW OF MY GUESTS TAKE A PROPER-- TAKE A PROPER BOW.
YES. I'M A THEATER MAN.
Stephen: EXACTLY. YOU ARE STAR OF STAGE AND SCREEN. YOU WERE IN "NINE" HERE ON BROADWAY THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE, REALLY.
Stephen: I AM-- I'M A BIG FAN. AND I'M ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW MOVIE. LET'S REMIND PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STORY OF THE 33. THIS WAS IN 2010.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: THERE WAS A TERRIBLE MINE DISASTER IN CHILE, AND WHAT HAPPENED DOWN IN THAT MINE? IS THIS ALL BASED ON A TRUE STORY?
IT'S BASED ON THE TRUE STORY, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND IN FACT WE HAD A LOT OF CONTACT WITH THE MINERS THEMSELVES. THEY GAVE US A LOT OF INFORMATION AND DATA OF WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE. AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS A STORY OF SURVIVAL, BASICALLY. ONCE THEY WERE FOUND, THERE WERE SOME OTHER PROBLEMS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, BESIDES THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING FOOD AND WATER AND MEDICINES, TO SURVIVE UNTIL THEY WERE RESCUED, WHICH WAS A DOUBT AT THE TIME. THEY DIDN'T KNOW, ACTUALLY, THAT THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
Stephen: THEY WERE REALLY FAR DOWN-- WHO DO YOU PLAY?
700 METERS UNDERGROUND.
Stephen: WHO DO YOU PLAY?
MARIO SEPULVEDA.
Stephen: OH, YOU PLAY SUPER MARIO.
YES.
Stephen: IT WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO BUT THEY CALLED HIM SUPER MARIO.
SUPER MARIO.
Stephen: SUPER MARIO. AND I'M SORRY, THEY WERE 700 METERS UNDERGROUND. WHICH IN AMERICA TALK THAT IS.
700 METERS UNDERGROUND.
Stephen: OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, YEAH, YEAH, I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. IT'S A LONG WAY-- IT'S MORE THAN I WOULD WANT TO DIG. IT IS MORE THAN I WOULD WANT TO DIG. DO YOU REMEMBER IT? DO YOU REMEMBER THE ACTUALLY STORY IT WAS IN THE NEWS?
OH, YES. I STARTED FOLLOWING THE STORY BASICALLY THE MOMENT THAT THEY ATTACHED THE DRILLS, THE DRILL THAT ACTUALLY FOUND THEM, AND THERE WAS A NOTE THAT SAID, "WE ARE ALIVE," THE 33.
Stephen: THEY DRILLED ALL THE WAY DOWN. THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THE GUYS SURVIVED AND THEY ATOUCHDOWN A NOTE TO THE DRILL. EXTRAORDINARY.
AND FROM THAT MOMENT IT BECAME A THRILLER, A SUSPENSEFUL MOVIE.
Stephen: AND THE MOST AMAZING THING ABOUT IT, A STORY LIKE THIS, VERY OFTEN IT STARTS OFF AS A TRAGIC STORY BUT IT'S SUCH A BRILLIANT, HAPPY ENDING. THEY ALL GET OUT.
IT'S MORE HOLLYWOOD THAN HOLLYWOOD THE STORY.
Stephen: YEAH, RIGHT.
IF SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE WRITE THIS, YOU KNOW, CRITICS WOULD HAVE KILLED THEM.
Stephen: HAVE YOU-- HAVE YOU BEEN DOWN IN A MINE?
WE SHOT ACTUALLY --
OH, YOU SHOT THE WHOLE THING IN A MINE.
IN REAL MINES IN COLOMBIA. WE DID IT IT IN COLOMBIA. WE WERE IN TWO MINES.
Stephen: WHAT WAS IT LIKE? IT WAS VERY HOT, I UNDERSTAND, DOWN IN THE ORIGINAL MINE?
IN THE ACTUAL MINE WHERE THE EVENT HAPPENED, IT WAS ACTUALLY VERY HOT. BUT WE WERE WORKING IN VERY COLD MINES, SO IMAGINE IT WAS NOT VERY NICE FOR US. IT WAS ACTUALLY MISERABLE.
Stephen: SO YOU WERE HAVING TO PRETEND THAT IT WAS HOT IN A COLD MINE.
THAT'S RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: WERE YOU, LIKE, SHIRTLESS AND EVERYTHING.
YHALF NAIK GLD WELL, I THINK YOU'RE BURYING THE LEAD. THIS IS MOVIE IS A HALF NAKED ANTONIO BANDERAS.
AND 32 OTHER GUYS.
Stephen: 32 OTHER GUYS, OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY, BUT LET'S PUT SOME ASSES IN THE SEAT HERE. IT'S LIKE "MAGIC MIKE 700 FEET UNDERGROUND." IT'S "MAGIC MINE, MAGIC MINE."
"MAGIC MINE."
Stephen: EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO MEET MARIO HIMSELF?
YES, I DID, I DID. WE BECAME KIND OF FRIENDS. HE WAS PRACTICALLY THERE THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE SHOOTING.
Stephen:  REALLY. WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR THE MEN? I KNOW HE AND SOME OTHERS BECAME VERY FAMOUS FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS RIVETTED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE FOR THESE DAYS. AND THEY WERE THRUST INTO THE SPOTLIGHT, LITERALLY WHEN THEY EMERGED FROM THE GROUND, EVERY CAMERA IN THE WORLD WAS POINTED AT THEM.
YEAH, THE FIRST THING HE SAID TO ME, ACTUALLY, WAS, "I AM NO ZORO." ( LAUGHTER ) HE SAID, "I AM NO ZORO. I AM NOT A HERO. I AM JUST A HUMAN BEING. I MADE MISTAKES. I TRAVELED THROUGH LIFE SO I WANT YOU TO PORTRAY ME LIKE THAT." IT WAS VERY NICE. ALL THE MINERS WERE TELLING US THAT. THEY DIDN'T LIKE BEING PORTRAYED BY HEROES. THEY WERE NORMAL PEOPLE.
Stephen: WAS HE THERE? WAS HE ON SET?
HE WAS.
Stephen: IS THAT HARD TO HAVE SOMEBODY WATCH YOU PORTRAY HIM OR DO YOU THINK HE'S A PERSON, I'M A CHARACTER, I HAVE TO DO MY OWN THING?
NO, IT WAS VERY HELPFUL. HE WAS WORKING WITH US AT SOME POINT. HE WAS JUST TAKING CARE OF THE EXTRAS, INSTRUCTING THEM-- SOME OF THEM WERE ACTUALLY REAL MINERS. AND THERE'S A SCENE ACTUALLY IN THE MOVIE IN WHICH I COME OUT OF THE MINE THEY SAW-- BECAUSE IT'S IN YOUTUBE, YOU CAN SEE THE REAL ONE. AND THERE WAS A MOMENT I JUMP OVER THE-- A BUNCH OF MINERS--
Stephen: OH, IS THIS THE, WHICH HI, CHI!
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND ONE OF THOSE MINERS WAS HIM AND I FACED THE CHARACTER THAT WAS IN THE IN OF.
Stephen: YOU JUMPED RANDOMLY INTO THE CROWD ON TO THE GUY YOU WERE PLAYING?
YESs.
Stephen: YOU HAVE ONE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE VOICES, YOU KNOW, IN ALL OF HOLLYWOOD.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND, YOU KNOW-- YOU'RE PUSS AND BOOTS. YOU'RE-- EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR VOICE. YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING SOUND SEXY.
REALLY?
Stephen: OKAY, SEDUCTIVE. I CAN PUT YOUR VOICE TO THE TEST?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.
Stephen: I HAVE A LIST OF THINGS HERE I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU SAY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I THINK-- THESE THINGS-- I THINK THESE-- I COULD-- NO WAY I COULD MAKE THESE EVER SOUND SEXY. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD, BUT IF ANYBODY COULD, YOU COULD. JUST TRY JUST THESE THREE RIGHT HERE.
I HAVE-- CAN I USE MY GLASSES.
Stephen: YOU'LL MAKE THEM SEXY. OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT. LET'S SEE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OPEN THE TAPS AND JUST LET THE SEXY OUT, OKAY? RIGHT INTO THAT CAMERA, RIGHT OVER THERE.
DO YOU HAVE THESE KHAKIS WITH LET'S? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!
Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO NEED SOME LET'S IN THEIR KHAKIS AFTER HEARING YOU SAY THAT. OKAY, NEXT. COME ON.
THE FISH OF THE DAY IS TALAPIA. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS-- THIS IS ALMOST SHAKESPEAREAN.
Stephen: YES.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK, THE FISH OF THE DAY IS TALAPIA.
Stephen: AND THE LAST ONE I THINK IS THE MOST CHALLENGING TO MAKE SEXY.
IT IS.
Stephen: GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT.
I'M JEB BUSH, AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

OH, I THINK JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: THAT'S-- THAT'S LIKE SAYING SOME MEN JUST WANT TO WATCH THE WORLD BURN. ARE YOU THE JOKER?
I THINK PEOPLE ARE, IN OUR INDUSTRY, ARE GRAVITATE TO DISRUPTION BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGE, BECAUSE IT'S A SENSE OF CHANGE AND IMPACT AND WHAT WE CAN DO. AND TO BE ABLE TO WATCH TV SHOWS ANY TIME YOU WANT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A NICE FRIENDLY KIND OF DISRUPTION.

Stephen: WHAT DO YOU USE-- ARE YOU USING SPACE-AGE ALGORITHMS TO READ MY MIND? LITERALLY, ARE YOU, LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT ME WHEN I GO ON TO NETFLIX? WHY DO YOU THINK I WANT TO WATCH "GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST?" ( LAUGHTER ).
BASED ON ALL OF YOUR OTHER CHOICES, THAT IS GOING TO BE A WINNER.
Stephen: SOMETIMES WEIRD STUFF WILL POP UP ON SOMEONE'S FIELD AND YOU GO WHY THIS? WHY? BECAUSE I WATCHED "BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR" WHY DO YOU ASSUME I'M A TEENAGED LESBIAN?
WE ACTUALLY ASSUME YOU'RE A MIDDLE-AGED MALE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS WE USED TO HAVE WHEN WE WATCHED TV AND YOU HAD TO WATCH IT AT A CERTAIN TIME, YOU KNEW THE NEXT DAY PEOPLE EITHER WATCHED IT OR THEY DIDN'T, THE WATER COOLER CONVERSATION. BUT NOW EVERY WATER COOLER CONVERSATION HAS TO START WITH, "WHERE ARE YOU, WHERE ARE YOU IN THIS SERIES?" YOU'VE RUINED CONVERSATION. DO YOU TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT?

CORRECT.
Stephen: YES, THANK YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS MY ORAL EXAM. YOU SAID YOU WRITE-- I UNDERSTAND YOU WRONG LONGHAND.
I DO.
Stephen: BECAUSE TYPE WRITERS ARE TOO FAST. TOO FAST FOR WHAT? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, FOR ME. I WORK SLOWLY AS IT IS, AND IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING IN 14 NOVELS IT'S THAT THEY'RE BETTER IF I MOVE EVEN MORE SLOWLY, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE WAITING A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE I BEGIN THEM, BUT WRITING THEM BY HAND SIMPLY MEANS I MAKE FEWER MISTAKES BECAUSE I MUST-- WHEN I WRITE BY HAND, I MUST BE MOVING AT THE RIGHT PACE FOR ME.

ARE YOUR BOOKS TRUE? ( LAUGHTER ) ARE THEY AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL? WE JUST HAD ANTONIO BANDERAS ON ABOUT THE MOVIE "THE 33", THE TRUE STORY OF THESE GUYS TRAPPED IN A MINE. ARE THESE AUTO BIOGRAPHICAL BOOKS?
NO, I'VE HAD A VERY DULL LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HAVE YOU REALLY HAD A DULL LIFE?
I HAVE, REALLY. AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL AS A WRITER, AS A FICTION WRITER, I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I'VE HAD AN UNEVENTFUL LIFE BECAUSE NOTHING IN IT IS SACRED TO ME WHEN I WANT TO USE IT AND MAKE IT BETTER OR IN MOST CASES, WORSE. ( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF MY NOVELS ARE WORST-CASE SCENARIOS, AND NOTHING AT ALL TRAGIC HAS HAPPENED TO ME. BUT I DO HAVE AN IMAGINATION. I BECAME A FATHER WHEN I WAS STILL A COLLEGE STUDENT. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT. ( LAUGHTER ) AND FROM THAT MOMENT, I BECAME AFRAID OF SOMETHING HAPPENING TO ANYONE I LOVED, ESPECIALLY MY CHILDREN. AND BY EXTENSION, IMAGINARY CHILDREN OR IMAGINARY CHARACTERS I LOVE. SO IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE. ANOTHER REASON TO GO SLOW IS THAT I TAKE A LONG TIME TO THINK OF CHARACTERS THAT I FEEL SYMPATHY FOR AND HOPE YOU WILL, TOO. AND THEN I THINK OF THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM.

DON'T BLEED IN FRONT OF THE BEAR! ( LAUGHTER ) A BOY LIKE YOU HAD AN AFTER SCHOOL JOB. THE SCHOOL BUS DROPPED HIM OFF NEAR A DIRT ROAD, WHERE PEOPLE DROVE TOO FAST. AT A BLIND CORNER OF THE DIRT ROAD WAS A LONG DRIVEWAY WITH A LITTLE HOUSE AND A BIG GARAGE. THERE WAS A BEAR IN THE GARAGE-- A WORN-OUT CIRCUS BEAR WHO WAS TOO OLD FOR CIRCUS TRICKS. THE BEAR NEVER LEFT THE OPEN GARAGE, NOT EVEN TO POOP. ( LAUGHTER ) THE BOY'S JOB WAS TO PICK UP THE POOP AND THE BEAR WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER ) THE BOY NEVER FELT AFRAID OF THE WORN-OUT OLD BEAR, BUT A STRANGE WOMAN WHO OWNED THE BEAR-- SHE'D BEEN AN ANIMAL TRAINER IN A CIRCUS-- THIS WOMAN HAD WARNED THE BOY ABOUT ONE THING. "DON'T EVER BLEED IN FRONT OF HIM. DON'T BLEED IN FRONT OF THE BEAR." ( LAUGHTER ) "WHY?" THE BOY ASKED. "JUST DON'T!" THE WOMAN SAID. ONE DAY-- OF COURSE!-- THE BOY CUT HIS HAND ON A BANGED-UP FAUCET. BLOOD DRIPPED INTO THE BEAR'S WATER BOWL. THE TIRED-LOOKING OLD BEAR PERKED UP. THE BEAR SUDDENLY SEEMED CAPABLE OF CIRCUS TRICKS, OR WORSE. THE BEAR TOOK A SNIFF OF THE BOY'S CUT HAND. ( SNIFFS ) ( LAUGHTER ) THE BOY RAN THE LENGTH OF THE DRIVEWAY TO THE DIRT ROAD WHERE THE BLIND CORNER WAS, AND HE KEPT ON RUNNING ACROSS THE ROAD. HE DIDN'T LOOK FIRST. THE OLD BEAR LICKED THE BLOOD OUT OF HIS WATER BOWL. THE BEAR COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO CHASE THE BOY. THE BEAR WAS FOCUSED ON THE BLOOD. THE BEAR NEVER SAW THE BOY GET HIT BY THE CAR. THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T CROSS THE ROAD WITHOUT LOOKING FIRST! GET IT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
