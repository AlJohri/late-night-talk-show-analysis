STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. WELCOME, WELCOME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I GOTTA SAY THERE'S NOTHING MORE HEARTWARMING THAN THE SOUND OF A MINDLESS MOB CHANTING YOUR NAME. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT. I AM REALLY EXCITED FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW... ONE IMAGINES. BECAUSE ALL I CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT IS TOMORROW'S RECORD $1.5 BILLION POWERBALL DRAWING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. NOW, I KNOW I DIDN'T WIN OVER THE WEEKEND, BUT THAT JUST MEANS I'M DUE, OKAY. LAST WEEK, WHEN THE JACKPOT WAS I PLAYED AND I LOST SO THIS TIME I DID WHAT ANY SANE PERSON WOULD DO-- THE EXACT SAME THING AGAIN, EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS. SO-- AND THIS IS TRUE, I GOT MY ROTO TICKET RIGHT HERE, ALL RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SMELLS LUCKY. AND THIS TIME TOMORROW, YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT A BILLIONAIRE-- ACTUALLY, YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT A RERUN, BECAUSE I WILL BE IN THE CARIBBEAN SNORTING LINES OF GROUND-UP PANDA OFF RICHARD BRANSON'S ASS. I LIKE MY ODDS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT BILLIONAIRES DO. I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE. I LIKE MY ODDS ON THIS ONE WHICH EXPERTS SAY-- THIS IS TRUE-- ONE IN 292.2 MILLION. MEANING-- AND THIS IS ALSO TRUE-- YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET STRUCK BY LIGHTNING OR BITTEN BY A SHARK OR IF YOU ARE REALLY LUCKY, BITTEN BY A LIGHTNING SHARK. CALL ME, DISCOVERY CHANNEL. SPEAKING OF HITTING THE JACKPOT, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FIRST UP, I'LL BE TALKING WITH OSCAR- AND GOLDEN-GLOBE NOMINEE SAOIRSE RONAN. SHE STARS IN THE MOVIE "BROOKLYN." AND IT IS THE ONLY MOVIE WHOSE TICKET COSTS A JAR OF ARTISANAL PICKLES. THAT'S A HARD WORD TO SAY-- ARTISANAL PICKLES. THEN I'LL INTERVIEW THE C.E.O. OF YELP, JEREMY STOPPELMAN. UNLESS I FIND A HIGHER RATED GUEST IN THE AREA. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN I'LL TALK TO LAURA RICCIARDI AND MOIRA DEMOS, THE DOCUMENTARIANS WHO MADE NETFLIX'S "MAKING A MURDERER." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU RAWLZ YOU'RE APPLAUDING MURDER RIGHT NOW. FINALLY, WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY JAMES BAY. JAMES BAY, WHOSE DEBUT ALBUM IS CALLED "CHAOS AND THE CALM." WHAT A COINCIDENCE. THAT'S ALL THE NAME OF MY FISTS. CHAOS, CALM ME DOWN. ♪ HOLD ON. DID YOUR EARS JUST GO INTO HEAT? THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHAOS. CHAOS. CHAOS, CALM. CHAOS CALM. YOU'RE LATE. YOU'RE LATE. YOU'RE LATE AGAIN. THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK OFF THE SHOW, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING. THE PLAYBOY MANSION IS UP FOR SALE FOR $200 MILLION, ALTHOUGH IT WILL TAKE 100 MILLION JUST TO DISINFECT THE GROTTO. >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES STAR OF "BROOKLYN," SAOIRSE RONAN. YELP C.E.O. JERRY STOPPELMAN. "MAKING A MURDERER" FILM MAKERS LAURA RICCIARDI AND MOIRA DEMOS. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY JAMES BAY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN.  Captioning sponsored by CBS AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLES, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. IF YOU TAKE EVEN A CURSORY LOOK AT YOUR "RESISTANCE TO GOVERNMENT TYRANNY BIRD-A-DAY" CALENDAR-- THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, BLUE JAY-- YOU KNOW WE ARE IN WEEK TWO OF THE SIEGE OF OREGON'S MALHEUR NATURE PRESERVE BY AMMON BUNDY AND HIS BRAVE BAND OF... I'M GONNA SAY RIDE ATTENDANTS AT BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN RAILROAD. ( LAUGHTER ) THESE MEN ARE DETERMINED TO OCCUPY THE MALHEUR PRESERVE-- MALHEUR, OF COURSE, FRENCH FO ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK, I THINK. I DON'T KNOW. I ASSUME. THEY'LL BE THERE UNTIL FEDERAL LAND IS TURNED OVER TO LOCALS OR UNTIL "WALKER, TEXAS RANGER" IS PUT BACK ON THE AIR. AND WHEN THIS STANDOFF STARTED, THEY KNEW IT COULD GO ON FOR A WHILE, BUT THEY WERE LACKING A FEW THINGS NEEDED FOR A LONG OCCUPATION, WHICH IS WHY THEY PUT OUT A CALL FOR "SUPPLIES OR SNACKS OR ANYTHING." AND IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUP, JUST MAIL THEM SUPPLIES, AND THEY WILL TRY TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT IT WAS DELIVERED BY A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE. BUT BY NOW, THEY MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH MOST OF THEIR SUPPLIES AND SNACKS AND ARE WELL INTO THEIR "ANYTHING," BECAUSE ON SATURDAY, THEY ASKED SUPPORTERS FOR MORE THAN 80 ITEMS IN AN EMAIL FROM AMMON BUNDY'S MOTHER. ( LAUGHTER ) VERY NICE OF HER. SHE WOULD BRING THE SUPPLIES HERSELF, BUT THEIR CLUBHOUSE SIGN CLEARLY SAYS, "NO GIRLS ALLOWED." AND THESE GUYS-- AND THESE GUYS NEED ALL THE BASICS YOU'D EXPECT FOR A LONG OCCUPATION-- FOOD LIKE HAMBURGERS, HOT DOGS, AND EGGS, NEEDED BADLY, AS WELL AS PERSONAL HYGEINE NEEDS LIKE BODY WASH, SHAMPOO, AND CONDITIONER. YES, SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO FACE OFF AGAINST THE JACK-BOOTED THUGS OF A TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT, BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO HAVE TO FIGHT THE FRIZZIES. YOU WANT THAT HAIR TO BOUNCE AND BEHAVE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THESE RUGGED MEN OF THE LAND ALSO REQUESTED PILLOWCASES, THROW RUGS OF ANY AND ALL SIZES FOR DOORWAYS, AND BEDSHEETS. SO THEY'RE EITHER STARTING A REVOLUTION OR OPENING A BED AND BREAKFAST. BUT, AGAIN, THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING EXTRAVAGANT, JUST THE BASICS NEEDED FOR REVOLUTION, LIKE FRENCH VANILLA CREAMER. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S JUST LIKE PATRICK HENRY'S BATTLE CRY AT THE BOSTON TEA PARTY: "GIVE ME FRENCH VANILLA OR GIVE ME HAZELNUT! THEY'RE BOTH YUMMY." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, THERE'S ONE OTHER SLIM POSSIBILITY OF HOW THESE FOLKS COULD GET SUPPLIES. IT TURNS OUT THEY ARE NOT SURROUNDED AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POLICE PRESENCE. SO THEY CAN COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE. MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE GOOGLE MAPS. LET ME HELP YOU OUT HERE, FELLAS. JUST OCCUPY SODHOUSE LANE FOR ABOUT SIX MILES. THEN OCCUPY 205 NORTH TO 78 WEST, AND GET OFF BY OCCUPYING THE MONROE EXIT. THEN YOU'RE AT THE SAFEWAY. WHERE YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR SUPPLIES AND OCCUPY ANY CHECKOUT LANE YOU WANT. DO NOT GIVE IN TO THE TYRANNY OF THE 10 ITEMS OR LESS LANE. REMEMBER, FREEDOM ISN'T FREE. AND THE FRENCH VANILLA CREAMER IS, LIKE, $2.99 A BOTTLE.

THIS IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO COMES AND MOVES TO AMERICA AND HAS TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE'S GOING TO STAY. YOU ACTUALLY WERE BORN IN AMERICA. YOU'RE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN AND YOU MOVED BACK TO IRELAND. THIS IS YOUR LIFE IN REVERSE? >> I GUESS SO. I WAS BORN IN THE BRONX, AS I'M SURE YOU COULD TELL. S THERE -- I UNDERSTAND YOU FELT PRESSURE DOING THIS FILM, YOU HAD TO REPRESENT YOUR HOME COUNTRY IN THE FILM. DID YOU SHOW IT BACK IN IRELAND? >> WE DID. WE HAD THE IRISH PREMIERE THERE AND HONESTLY, IT FELT LIKE MY WEDDING. BECAUSE IT WAS EVERYONE-- IT WAS ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT WERE THERE, AND JUST EVERYONE THAT WE KNEW AND THAT WE LOVED. AND IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US THAT THEY DIDN'T HATE IT. SO KIND OF THE WHOLE TIME WHEN I WAS MAKING THE FILM, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THEM TO HATE ME OR THE FILM. AND I DON'T THINK THEY DID, UNLESS THEY WERE JUST VERY GOOD LIARS. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: NOW, THE IRISH EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA IS LIKE AN IDENTITY, BUT WE-- AS I WAS SAYING, WE DON'T DO THE ACCENT ALL THAT WELL, AS I CAN PROVE. AND WE HAVE AN ODD IDEA OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IRISH IN AMERICA. YOU HAVE EVER BEEN IN AMERICA FOR A ST. PATRICK'S DAY? >> I MEAN, WHEN I WAS A BABY, BUT IT DIDN'T -- >> HAVE YOU BEEN IN NEW YORK FOR A ST. PATRICK'S DAY? >> NO, BUT I'M GOING TO BE HERE THIS YEAR FOR IT. I'M MOVING-- I'M LIKE HERE, NOW. >> Stephen: DON'T DO IT. >> DON'T DO IT. LOCK THE DOOR. >> Stephen: OR PUT YOURSELF IN A SAFE LOCATION. MEETING AN ACTUAL IRISH PERSON ON ST.

ALCOHOL IS JUST IN THE BLOODSTREAM. THAT'S ALL PEOPLE WANT TO DO ON -- >> IT'S ACTUALLY A THING? >> NOT ALL OF US ARE ALCOHOLICS. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'RE NOT.

YOU KNOW, OVER THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY LOTTO TICKET. AND, AGAIN, FOR THOSE JUST JOINING US, I'M GOING TO WIN. ANYBODY WANT TO SEE THE WINNING NUMBERS? RIGHT THERE. KA-POW! THERE IT IS! NOW, ALARMINGLY, THERE SEEMS TO BE ONE THING STANDING IN MY WAY: OTHER PEOPLE BUYING TICKETS. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. AND SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN AMERICANS. >> EXCITEMENT IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY. THOUSANDS OF CANADIANS ARE POURING INTO THE U.S. TO TRY THEIR LUCK. >> THE CANADIANS, THEY'RE COMING LIKE CRAZY HERE FOR THE LOTTO. >> I'M GONNA TAKE MY CHANCES JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. WE COME HERE AND DROP A LOT OF MONEY ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE SHOP IN THE U.S. A LOT, SO WE GIVE TO YOU. IT'S TIME TO GIVE BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: NO ONE DISPUTES THAT CANADA GIVES US A LOT, FROM THEIR DELICIOUS SYRUP TO THEIR FINEST GOSLINGS. BUT YOU ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE HERE, CANADIAN WOMAN, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU, IF ONE OF YOU MOOSE-MUNCHING ICE-HOLES WINS AMERICA'S BILLION-DOLLAR POWERBALL, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL VOTE FOR HIM! I WILL VOTE FOR HIM! BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO BUILD A WALL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA AND MAKE THE POWERBALL WINNER PAY FOR IT! SO AN AMERICAN HAS GOT TO WIN THIS THING, AND PEOPLE ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR ADVICE FROM THE EXPERTS, LIKE SEVEN-TIME LOTTO WINNER RICHARD LUSTIG, A MAN WHO STRUCK IT SO BIG IN THE LOTTO, HE CAN FULFILL HIS LIFELONG DREAM OF CONTINUING TO PLAY THE LOTTO. >> THE QUESTION THEY ASK IS, "WHAT CAN I DO? WHAT CAN I DO TO GIVE MYSELF A BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING?" >> Stephen: YES, THAT'S THE QUESTION I'M ASKING! >> THIS IS GOING TO SOUND BAD, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY ANSWER-- BUY AS MANY TICKETS AS YOU CAN AFFORD. >> Stephen: "BUY AS MANY AS YOU CAN AFFORD." OKAY, GOT IT. SOUND ADVICE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE IN IT TO WIN IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO BUDGET FOR THE ESSENTIALS-- FOOD, RENT, SCRATCHERS, THE PONIES, CAMEL STRAIGHTS. NOW, SOME MIGHT SAY THERE'S NO WAY TO GAME A COMPLETELY RANDOM SYSTEM AND THAT YOU'RE FAR BETTER OFF SAVING OR INVESTING YOUR MONEY. THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED SUCKERS. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE TAKING THEMSELVES OUT OF THE GAME, AND LEAVING ALL THEIR DAUGHTERS' LUCKY BIRTHDAYS FOR YOU TO PLAY. SO WHILE I'M GOING TO CLEARLY WIN THIS ONE, HERE ARE SOME "LATE SHOW" POWERBALL TIPS. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE TIP IS THE MOST SENSITIVE PART OF THE POWERBALL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) >> Stephen: DON'T ENCOURAGE ME? OKAY, "LATE SHOW'S"" POWERBALL TIP NUMBER ONE-- PICK ONLY WINNING NUMBERS, BE IT 8, 11, 39-- YOUR CHOICE, BUT PICK THE ONES THAT WIN. TIP NUMBER TWO: KNOW WHAT NUMBERS ARE. A LOT OF FOLKS LOSE BEFORE THEY EVEN PLAY BECAUSE THEY PICK AN AMPERSAND OR THE EMOJI FOR EGGPLANT. THOSE ARE NOT NUMBERS. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS IS. TIP NUMBER THREE: IF IT'S SMART TO BUY AS MANY TICKETS AS YOU CAN AFFORD, THINK HOW SMARTER IT IS TO BUY MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY, YOU ASK? THE GUY IN THE FUTURE. THAT GUY'S LOADED BECAUSE HE JUST WON THE LOTTERY WITH TIPS ONE THROUGH TWO. NEXT, TIP NUMBER FOUR: IF YOU WANT TO BE A LOTTERY WINNER, START ACTING LIKE A LOTTERY WINNER. BUY ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS MATCHING JEEPS. PICK UP AN EXPENSIVE PILL ADDICTION. START SCREAMING AT YOUR LOVED ONES, "I'M NOT A DAMN BANK!" THEN WAKE UP IN A RADISSON BATHROOM UNDER A PILE OF NAKED STRANGERS, EMPTY THE MINI BAR INTO YOUR POCKETS, AND SLINK BACK TO YOUR JOB AT THE VERIZON STORE. BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THAT PAYCHECK TO BUY MORE LOTTO TICKETS. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT TIP OF ALL: HAVE THIS LOTTERY TICKET BECAUSE THAT POWERBALL IS ALL MINE! I'LL SEE YOU AT THE RADISSON! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YELP C.E.O., JEREMY STOPPELMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CO-FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF YELP.

DO I HAVE THAT CORRECT? >> YES. >> YOU GOT IT RIGHT. >> Stephen: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT WATCHED YOUR DOCUMENTARY SERIES YET, "MAKING A MURDERER," LET ME GIVE A SUMMARY AND SEE IF I LEAVE ANYTHING OUT THAT'S NECESSARY FOR OUR CONVERSATION. STEVEN AVERY IS CONVICTED IN 1985 OF A RAPE AND GOES TO JAIL FOR 18 YEARS. HE'S EXONERATED WHEN D.N.A. PROVES SOMEONE ELSE COMMITTED CRIME, AND HE'S FREED. ON HIS RELEASE, HE SUES THE LOCAL POLICE FOR $36 MILLION. IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT CASE, HE'S ACCUSED OF A MURDER AND THE SAME LOCAL POLICE ARE HEAVILY INVOLVE INSIDE GATHERING EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM.

YOU WOULD HAVE SAVED US A LOT OF TIME, ACTUALLY. >> Stephen: THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. YOU HAVE WORKED ON THIS FOR 10 YEARS. HOW DID YOU FIRST LEARN THE STORY OF STEVEN AVERY? >> SO, IT WAS BACK IN NOVEMBER OF 2005, AND STEVEN AVERY APPEARED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND THE HEADLINE READ, "FREED BY D.N.A. NOW CHARGED IN NEW CRIME." AND WE WERE IMMEDIATELY FASCINATED BY THE HEADLINE AND WENT ON TO READ THE STORY AND UNDERSTAND THAT STEVEN WAS IN THIS INCREDIBLE POSITION OF HAVING SERVED 18 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT. HE BECAME ONE OF WISCONSIN'S FIRST D.N.A. EXONRIES, AND WITHIN TWO YEARS OF HIS RELEASE WAS CHARGED WITH MURDER. >> Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTARY SERIES AND THEY LOOK AT IT AS A, YOU KNOW, A WHO DONE IT. BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE YOUR INTENTION IN MAKING IT? WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS? WHAT DO YOU HOPE THE MESSAGE OF THE DOCUMENTARY IS. >> WE LIKE TO SAY IT'S MORE A "HOW DONE IT." WHAT WE WERE DOCUMENTING IS THE PROCESS, AND THAT'S CHA JUSTICE IS, IT'S A PROCESS. SO CAN WE RELY ON THESE VERDICTS AT THE END. >> Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE TAKE AWAY FROM WATCHING THE DOCUMENTARY IS THAT POOR PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A GREAT SHOT IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO REPRESENTATION. HE HAS ACCESS TO GREAT REPRESENTATION BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY WON A VERDICT THAT GOT HIM $100,000 HE COULD USE TO PAY LAWYERS. BUT THAT POOR PEOPLE OFTEN GET RAILROADED THROUGH THE SYSTEM. DO YOU SEE ANY HOPE FROM THIS DOCUMENTARY? BECAUSE IT'S A FAIRLY BLEAK STORY. I'M ONLY ON EPISODE SEVEN, NO SPOILERS. EVERYTHING WORKS OUT OKAY, RIGHT? EVERYBODY IS HAPPY AT THE END? >> KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING. >> Stephen: DO YOU GET ANY SENSE OF HOPE FROM THIS? >> I THINK YOU DO. I MEAN, THE PEOPLE IN THE SERIES HAVE NOT GIVEN UP HOPE. AND, I MEAN, WE UNDERSTAND THAT FOR VIEWERS, THIS CAN BE OVERWHELMING. I MEAN, WE'RE THROWING A LOT AT YOU, AND IT CAN BE TERRIFYING WHAT YOU SEE. >> Stephen: THE TERRIFYING THING IS THAT YOU COULD END UP ACCUSED OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE NOT DONE AND HAVE NO WAY TO DEFEND YOURSELF. >> ABSOLUTELY. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANY ONE OF US, AND GOOD LUCK IF THAT HAPPENS. >> Stephen: YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE THE SUBJECT OF ONE OF YOUR DOCUMENTARIES IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE INTENTION OF IT WAS, PEOPLE ARE SAYING-- PEOPLE ARE DEBATING ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, AFTER WATCHING YOUR DOCUMENTARY, IS HE GUILTY OR NOT? WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> I MEAN, MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THE STATE DID NOT MEET ITS BURDEN EITHER IN STEVEN AVERY'S CASE OR BRENDAN DASSEY'S CASE. SO I WOULD SAY, IN MY OPINION, NOT GUILTY. >> Stephen: IN YOUR OPINION? >> I MEAN, I PRETTY MUCH AGREE WITH LAURA. >> Stephen: IS THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK HIGHS GUILTY OR THEY HAVEN'T-- BECAUSE WHO AM I TO SAY? WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING WAY, THERE ARE THINGS, IF YOU CAN'T GET RID OF THAT EVIDENCE, IF YOU CAN'T DISCOUNT THAT EVIDENCE, THERE'S BLOOD, THERE'S BONES, THERE'S LOCATION, ALL THOSE THINGS SAY WELL IT'S REASONABLE TO ME TO CONSIDER THIS PERSON AT LEAST A SUSPECT FOR IT. YOU KNOW, IS IT THE IDEA THAT WE'VE GOT GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY IN OUR SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO PROVEN OR NOT PROVEN? >> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS THAT HE COULD BE GUILTY, BUT IS HE GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT? NOTHING I'VE SEEN-- AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF STUFF-- NOTHING I'VE SEEN HAS CONVINCED ME OF THAT. >> Stephen: WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR NEXT DOCUMENTARY ON, SOMETHING LIKE CUCKOO CLOCK MAKERS OR ICE DANCING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) HAS IT BEEN HARD TO LIVE WITH THIS STORY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME? >> I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE, BUT I HAVEN'T REACHED OUT TO HER YET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THIS? BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME-- YOU ARE HAVING A MOMENT RIGHT NOW FOR YOUR WORK, BUT IS IT DIFFICULT TO ENJOY THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS YOU'RE HAVING WITH THIS WHEN YOU KNOW AT THE HEART OF IT THERE'S A TRAGEDY, FOR THE FAMILY WHO LOST A DAUGHTER AND FOR THE MAN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE FALSELY ACCUSED? >> ABSOLUTELY. WE FEEL LIKE THERE ARE NO WINNERS HERE. WHAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE BY SHARING THIS STORY WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN IS REALLY TO TRY TO ENGAGE AMERICANS AND FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN AGENCY HERE. FOR INSTANCE, IF WE SEE SOMEONE IN A PERP WALK ON TELEVISION, WE CAN CHECK OURSELVES AND TRY TO RESERVE JUDGMENT ABOUT THAT PERSON BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, THAT PERSON STANDS AS AN ACCUSED, HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN GUILTY. >> Stephen: WELL, I MEAN, HOPEFULLY ONE POSITIVE OUTCOME OF THIS COULD BE MORE PEOPLE TAKING AN INTEREST IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR MAYBE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE WANTING TO BE DEFENDERS OF PEOPLE WHO GET PULLED INTO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE WITHOUT PROPER REPRESENTATION YOU JUST BECOME A COG IN THE MACHINE. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, STEPHEN. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, STEPHEN. >> Stephen: LAURA RICCIARDI, AND MOIRA DEMOS, "MAKING A MURDERER" IS STREAMING RIGHT NOW ON NETFLIX.
