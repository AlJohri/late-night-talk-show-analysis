(  BAND PLAYING INTRO MUSIC  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  Captioning sponsored by CBS >> Stephen: HI, EVERYONE! THANKS VERY MUCH! HEY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! (AUDIENCE CHANTING STEPHEN) THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! THANKS, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YEAH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU CAN'T FOOL ME, YOU'RE JUST CHANTING TO STAY WARM. (LAUGHTER) AS YOU CAN SEE, THE HOLIDAY SEASON HAS BEGUN. OVER THE WEEKEND, WE PUT UP OUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. REALLY FUN TO PUT THEM UP IN DECEMBER, KIND OF DEPRESSING TO TAKE DOWN IN JANUARY. SO I ALWAYS JUST LEAVE THEM UP 'TIL FEBRUARY AND CALL THEM BLACK HISTORY MONTH LIGHTS. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU DON'T HAVE YOURS UP, YOU'RE A RACIST. (LAUGHTER) I'M JUST SAYIN'! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M DOING MY PART. OF COURSE, WITH THE HOLIDAYS COMES THE TRADITION OF YEAR-END LISTS. THAT DATES BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE FIRST CHRISTMAS, WHEN MELCHIOR WAS VOTED "YEAR'S SEXIEST MAGI." BALTHAZAR WAS SO MAD. WHY DID HE LOSE ALL THAT WEIGHT? HE HAD ABS YOU COULD GRATE FRANKINSENSE ON. WELL, IN THAT YEAR-END TRADITION, TODAY, "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED" NAMED ITS 2015 SPORTSPERSON OF THE YEAR, AND IT'S SERENA WILLIAMS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE'S LOOKING LIKE SHE'S BEYONCE AUDITIONING FOR A GAME OF THRONES, I THINK. (LAUGHTER) THIS YEAR, SHE ALMOST GOT THE GRAND SLAM WINNING THREE OF THE FOUR MAJORS, OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PRIZE MONEY, AND WON 53 OF HER 56 MATCHES. GIVE IT UP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen:, I'M SORRY -- NO, I WAS JUST SAYING, IF YOU'RE ANOTHER TENNIS PLAYER, CONSIDER GIVING UP. BUT SOME ANGRY INTERNET PEOPLE THINK THAT TRIPLE CROWN WINNER AMERICAN PHARAOH SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS TITLE INSTEAD, TWEETING "DISAPPOINTED THAT #AMERICANPHAROAH THE ONLY NOMINEE TO ACTUALLY WIN A #GRANDSLAM DIDN'T GET IT." "AMERICAN PHARAOH WAS ROBBED... SO SAD" AND "AMERICAN PHAROAH IS THE WINNER-HANDS DOWN." REALLY? WINNER "HANDS" DOWN? (LAUGHTER) HE HAS HOOVES. THEY'RE ALWAYS DOWN. WHEN THE HOOVES GO UP, THAT'S A BAD SIGN. BUT AMERICAN PHAROAH HAS BEEN VERY GRACIOUS. WHEN ASKED WHETHER HE SHOULD HAVE WON, HE REPLIED: "NAY." (LAUGHTER) YOU COULD USE THAT JOKE WITH YOUR 3-YEAR-OLD GRANDCHILDREN. (LAUGHTER) BESIDES, THIS AWARD IS FOR SPORTS-"PERSON" OF THE YEAR. AMERICAN PHAROAH ISN'T EVEN ELIGIBLE. UNLESS, HE'S ACTUALLY TWO PEOPLE IN A HORSE COSTUME! WHICH WOULD BE QUITE AN ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENT. ESPECIALLY FOR THE GUY IN THE BACK. TOUGH GIG, BUT WELL WORTH IT WHEN THEY PUT YOU OUT TO STUD. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. FIRST, I'M SITTING DOWN WITH THE STAR OF THE NEW MOVIE "JOY," JENNIFER LAWRENCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE SAYS SHE'S OVER BEING ADORABLE, BUT I JUST MET HER BACKSTAGE, AND I THINK SHE'S HAD A RELAPSE. (LAUGHTER) THEN, I'M TALKING TO PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SHE'S THE WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE, BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW HER BEST FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S "GIRL QUAD." AND WE'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE BY THE REUNITED SLEATER-KINNEY (APPLAUSE) THEY'LL BE PLAYING A SONG FROM THEIR ALBUM, "NO CITIES TO LOVE." SO IF THEY SAY "WE LOVE YOU NEW YORK!" - DON'T FALL FOR IT. ♪ OOH, HEAR THAT? THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY'RE ABOUT TO CRANK IT UP AND RIP OFF THE KNOB, THEN REPLACE THE KNOB, BECAUSE THAT KNOB IS THE PROPERTY OF CBS. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING. A MAN IN D.C. IS OFFERING $100 CLASSES ON HOW TO SMOKE POT. LESSON NUMBER ONE: IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE HIM THAT MONEY, YOU'RE ALREADY HIGH. >> TONIGHT... STEPHEN WELCOMES JENNIFER LAWRENCE! DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN! AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY SLEATER-KINNEY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! ♪ AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ (AUDIENCE CHAPTERING STEPHEN) >> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU, JON! THANK YOU, BAND! LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT EVERY NIGHT I GET TO TALK ABOUT THE WORLD CHANGING. BECAUSE WE ARE WITNESSES TO HISTORY. ON FRIDAY, WORLD LEADERS SHOCKED DOUBTERS BY AGREEING ON A PLAN TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING. SOMEONE TALK ABOUT IT. >> A HISTORIC CLIMATE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BY ALMOST 200 COUNTRIES YESTERDAY IN PARIS. THE ACCORD HOPES TO LIMIT AVERAGE INCREASE OF GLOBAL WARMING TO 3.6 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, WHICH SCIENTISTS SAY IS A BREAKING POINT FOR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, SUCH AS MASS EXTINCTION AND MEGA FLOODS. >> WORLD LEADERS ARE HAILING THIS DEAL IN PARIS AS A MILESTONE TO KEEP PLANET EARTH HOSPITABLE FOR HUMAN LIFE. >> WHOOO! "HOSPITABLE FOR HUMAN LIFE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK HOW EXCITED THEY ARE! I'VE GOT TO SAY... THAT'S SETTING THE BAR ABOUT AS LOW AS IT CAN GO. "AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I PROMISE YOU: SOMETHING WILL LIVE." (LAUGHTER) BUT WHATEVER THEY'VE AGREED TO, IT'S ABOUT TIME. IT WAS NEARLY 70 DEGREES THIS WEEKEND IN NEW YORK, AND I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE AGREEMENT WHEN I WAS OUT CHRISTMAS SHOPPING IN FLIP FLOPS AND A HALTER TOP. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT THEY AGREED TO: OVER THE NEXT CENTURY, THIS DEAL LIMITS THE RISE IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE TO 3.6 DEGREES FARENHEIT. OR, AS IT SAYS IN THE OFFICIAL AGREEMENT, TWO DEGREES CELSIUS. SO IT'S ALREADY LOWERING THE NUMBERS. AND THE DEAL GETS EVEN MORE STRINGENT LATER THIS CENTURY-- A TIME PERIOD WE CAN NOW CONFIRM MIGHT HAPPEN. AT SOME POINT BETWEEN 2050 AND 2100, THE COUNTRIES AGREED TO LIMIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO THE LEVELS THAT TREES, SOIL, AND OCEANS CAN ABSORB NATURALLY. WHICH IS A FINE GOAL, THOUGH IT WILL PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE LAST REMAINING TREE. YOU CAN DO IT, PINEY! BREATHE! BREATHE, BOY! (LAUGHTER) BOTTOM LINE, BY 2050, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE OFF OIL ENTIRELY. AND I KNOW HANNUKAH CELEBRATES THE OIL LASTING EIGHT DAYS. BUT COME 2050, THE MENORA IS GOING TO LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND THE DEAL ALMOST DIDN'T HAPPEN, BECAUSE IN THE SECTION THAT COMMITTED WEALTHY COUNTRIES TO CUT EMISSIONS, THE U.S. HAD A PROBLEM WITH ONE WORD. >> THE AMERICAN DELEGATION SAID WE DON'T WANT IT TO SAY "SHALL". WE WANT IT TO SAY "SHOULD". >> STEPHEN: YES, NOT "SHALL" REDUCE, "SHOULD" REDUCE. STILL VERY FORCEFUL. YOU KNOW, LIKE: THOU "SHOULD" NOT COVET THEY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE. IT'S REALLY MORE OF A SUGGESTION. THANKS FOR THE TIP, BIG GUY. BUT "SHOULD" STILL HAS PLENTY OF MORAL AUTHORITY. REMEMBER THE OLD CIVIL RIGHTS SONG: "WE "SHOULD" OVERCOME!... SOMEDAY." THE OBAMA FOLKS INSISTED ON THE CHANGE SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SUBMIT THE AGREEMENT TO THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS, WHO ARE ALREADY SPEAKING OUT IN OPPOSITION TO THE CLIMATE DEAL. THEY'RE VERY CONSISTENT, THEY OPPOSE OBAMACARE AND OBAMA-AIR. THEY JUST WANT TO REPEAL AND -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY JUST HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO REPEAL AND REPLACE THE ENVIRONMENT. NOW I'M TRYING TO DO MY PART. I DON'T EVEN DRIVE A CAR ANYMORE. MY DRIVER DOES IT. (LAUGHTER) THAT CUTS EMISSIONS BY 50% RIGHT THERE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY TO COMPLETELY GIVE UP FOSSIL FUELS. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE PLANET, TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO SAY GOODBYE TO OIL. COME ON OUT HERE, BUDDY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COME HERE. RIGHT OVER HERE. (APPLAUSE) NO,   NO, HE'S A FRIEND! THIS IS THE "LATE SHOW"'S PET BARREL OF OIL, CRUDE-Y GIULIANI. (APPLAUSE) SAY HI, CRUDE-Y. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN TIMES TOGETHER. BUT THE PARIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN SIGNED, AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO. NO, GO ON. CRUDE-Y! ♪ EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE BIT LONELY AND YOU NEVER COME AROUND ♪ ♪ TURN AROUND ♪ ♪ EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE BIT TIRED ♪ >> Stephen: NO, GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND! GOODBYE, CRUDE-Y! GOODBYE! I HATE TO SEE HIM GO, BUT I LOVE TO WATCH HIM LEAVE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) >> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE OSCAR WINNING ACTRESS WHO HAS STARRED IN THE "HUNGER GAMES" AND "X -MEN" SERIES, AS WELL AS "SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK" AND "AMERICAN HUSTLE". SHE NOW STARS IN "JOY." (LIVE FILM CLIP) >> THERE IS A GUN ON THE TABLE. THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM IS AN ADVERSARY IN COMMERCE. ONLY ONE OF YOU CAN PREVAIL. YET... YOU HAVE PROTECTED YOUR BUSINESS AND MAURICE'S LOVE. DO YOU PICK UP THE GUN? >> THAT'S A VERY STRANGE QUESTION. >> THERE IS NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS QUESTION AT ALL. THIS IS MONEY. DO YOU PICK UP THE GUN? >> I PICK UP THE GUN. (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WOW. PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER LAWRENCE! ( BAND PLAYING ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME! THANK YOU! >> Stephen: I WILL GET BACK TO THE MOVIE IN JUST A SECOND. DO YOU PICK UP THE GUN? DOES JENNIFER PICK UP THE GUN? >> I'D LOVE TO. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CUT THROAT TO ANYBODY? >> I WOULD GO THROUGH A LOT OF REGULATIONS BEFORE DOING IT. AND IF I WAS ON A NO-FLY LIST, I WOULD NOT. >> Stephen: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU ARE KNOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST RELATABLE PEOPLE OUT THERE. >> HE SAYS ON TELEVISION. >> Stephen: NO, IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS WHO ARE PROFESSIONALLY FAMOUS AND SUPPOSEDLY RELATABLE. BUT YOU ACTUALLY SEEM LIKE A HUMAN BEING. >> OH, THANK YOU! >> Stephen: DO YOU ENJOY BEING A HUMAN BEING? >> I DO, YEAH. >> Stephen: THEY'RE NOT PERFECT. >> NO. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? >> Stephen: NO, I'M SAYING YOU DON'T MIND SEEMING LIKE YOU'RE NOT PERFECT. >> I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. >> Stephen: YOU COULD. PEOPLE HAVE PUBLICISTS. >> OH, I DO. >> Stephen: ARE YOU NICE FOR YOUR PUBLICIST? >> NO. I DON'T THINK SO. SHE'S A NIGHTMARE. (LAUGHTER) I'M KIDDING. I HAVE BEEN WITH HER SINCE I WAS 16. >> Stephen: REALLY? YEAH. WE'RE LIKE SISTERS. >> Stephen: YOU ARE HERE WITH YOUR FOLKS TONIGHT. >> I KNOW. >> Stephen: IT'S SO NICE. THEIR FLIGHT GOT DELAYED. SORRY. I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM, ANYWAY. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 45 SECONDS AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT ATTACK YOU. >> I HAVE BEEN DROPPED BY MY PUBLICIST, MY PARENTS WILL BE GONE BY THE TIME I GET BACK THERE. THEY'RE FROM KENTUCKY. >> Stephen: BUT YOU'RE FROM KENTUCKY, TOO. >> I AM. HAD A DREAM THE OTHER NIGHT I HAD A SOUTHERN ACCENT, I COULDN'T GET OUT OF IT AND I WAS ON SET. AND I'M, LIKE, I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY ACCENT, I DON'T KNOW WHY! BECAUSE I LOST IT WHEN I WAS A TEENAGE SNORE WHEN DOES IT COME BACK? >> I AM TOLD BY BOYFRIENDS WHEN I'M YELLING, AND THEN PROBABLY MAYBE WHEN I'M DRINKING. BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE ONE ANYMORE. >> Stephen: NO, YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU HAVE ONE. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE FROM DISTRICT 12. >> WHAT'S THAT I? >> Stephe >> Stephen: I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST IDEA. I'M A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN. WHY WOULD I KNOW? THAT'S KIND OF CREEPY. (APPLAUSE) THE NEW MOVIE YOU'RE DOING WITH DAVIDO RUGSLE, THIS IS YOUR THIRD MOVIE, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> Stephen: WHAT'S HE LIKE TO WORK WITH AS A DIRECTOR? IS HE A TUMPY-FEELY, LET'S GET TO KNOW YOU KIND OF DIRECTOR OR A SHOUTY DIRECTOR? >> NO, HE SHOUTS BUT NEVER IN ANGER. HE'S JUST BIG AND ANIMATED BUT HE NEVER SHOUTS FROM ANGER. >> Stephen: DO YOU LIKE THAT THAN OTHER DIRECTORS WHO COME IN AND SAY, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK? >> NO, I WORK MUCH BETTER WITH HIM BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH SPORTS. IT'S MUCH BETTER WHEN IT'S, THAT'S BAD! BE BETTER! INSTEAD OF, I FEEL LIKE THE CHARACTER -- I'M JUST, DO YOU WANT ME TO TALK LOUDER, SLOWER -- >> Stephen: YOU HAVE TO HUNKER DOWN AND GO DOWN AND OUT AND I WILL HIT YOU! >> YEAH, EXACTLY. GET THIS RIGHT OR WE DON'T BREAK FOR LUNCH, YEAH. >> Stephen: YOUR KENTUCKY ACCENT JUST CAME BACK. WHEN YOU DO SPORTS IT COMES BACK. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE PLAYING A GUY -- A GUY. YOU'VE GOT THAT RANGE. (LAUGHTER) JOY MANGANO, RIGHT? WHO INVENTED THE MIRACLE MOP. (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: IS THAT A TRUE SNERN. >> YES, BASED ON JOY MANGANO. IT'S LOOSELY BASED ON HER LIFE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO A STRAIGHT BIOGRAPHICAL BUT ALL THE CRAZY PARTS ARE BASED ON HER AND HER LIFE. >> Stephen: SHE MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFF THIS INVENTION. >> Stephen: SUPER RICH. YEAH. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF ANYTHING TO INVENT? >> TAPING YOUR APPLE TV THE REMOTE TO A WOODEN SPOON DEVICE, DISCUSS THAT COUNT? >> Stephen: YEAH, SURE DOES. THEN YES. >> Stephen: WOW. WE ONLY HAVE 60 LEFT. CALL NOW. (LAUGHTER) ROBERT DE NIRO IS IN THIS. HE WILL BE MY GUEST WEDNESDAY. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANTED TO ASK HIM BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE JUEVOS TO ASK HIM? >> HE'S A SOFT SPEAKER. I SPEND THE WHOLE TIME SAYING, WHAT?! WHAT?! HE MAKES ME LOOK LIKE THE OLD ONE. >> Stephen: THAT'S AN ACTOR'S TRICK. >> I KNOW. BUT I THINK IT'S REALISM. ASK HIM IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN HIS CUCUMBER MARTINI BETWEEN SHAKEN AND COLD. THAT IS WHAT HE SAYS -- REALLY, REALLY, EXTREMELY, VERY COLD. AND EVERY TIME HE ORDERS THEM, IT'S, LIKE, CAN YOU FEEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING SHAKEN IN ICE AND BEING SHAKEN IN ICE FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER? IT'S WHY I DON'T INTERVIEW PEOPLE, IT'S A TERRIBLE QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW. CAN WE QUIT TALKING ABOUT ME? >> Stephen: ABSOLUTELY. I CAN'T THINK OF MY QUESTIONS! (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: YOU AND AMY SHIEWMER ARE BUDDIES. >> YES. >> Stephen: SHE SAYS SHE LOVES BEING WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE IDEAL HOTTEST VERSION OF HER SHE CAN THINK OF. >> IT'S, LIKE, YOU'RE NOT UGLY ENOUGH AND I'M NOT HOT ENOUGH TO PULL THESE JOKES OFFER. AND SHE'S, LIKE, I KNOW I'M GORGEOUS, BUT I DO IT IN STANDUP, AND IT WORKS. I'M, LIKE, I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SINCE. SHE HAS A SWEET LITTLE ASS, A GREAT (BLEEP). >> Stephen: YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE PERSON. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: BUT, AGAIN, YOU'RE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE UNGLAMOROUS. YOU WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT AREN'T GLAMOROUS. LIKE I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT VERY SICK MAKING THIS FILM. >> I DID. I GOT A STOMACH VIRUS. I WAS PUKING. I HAD TO MAKE OUT WITH SOMEBODY. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AND I WOULD START PUKING AND DO MOUTHWASH AND BE, LIKE, ARE YOU READY? LICKING MY CHOPS -- >> Stephen: THAT'S HOW YOU WIN A GOLDEN GLOBE. (LAUGHTER) >> I'M A BIG-TIME PUKE SNORER. >> Stephen: REALLY? YEAH, I'M LIKE A SHOW PONEY. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE AND I KEEP GOING UNTIL MY BODY IS LIKE IF WE DON'T MAKE HER BARK OR PASS OUT, SHE WON'T STOP. I GET LINDSEY LOHAN-GRADE EXHAUSTION BUT WITHOUT ANY DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. I'M ALWAYS IN BED EARLY. >> Stephen: ANYTHING WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES? >> I NEVER KNOW. >> Stephen: I TELL YOU WHAT, WE HAVE TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. LET'S FIND OUT. BACK WITH MORE JENNIFER LAWRENCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (BAND PLAYING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK! WE'RE HERE WITH JENNIFER LAWRENCE. JENNIFER, THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY SAYS, LIKE, YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLY RELATABLE PERSON, AND IT'S TRUE, BECAUSE I'M A 51-YEAR-OLD MAN BUT YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A 25-YEAR-OLD WOMAN. (LAUGHTER) IT'S BECAUSE YOU SEEM SO RELAXED AND HAPPY. ARE THERE THINGS THAT UPSET AND FRIGHTEN YOU ABOUT THE WORLD? >> YEAH. I WAS PRETTY UPSET -- I FOUND OUT RECENTLY -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DID IT A LONG TIME AGO BUT I ONLY RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT IT -- THEY RELEASED A CAPSULE IN SPACE AT SOME TIME, I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WAS, WITH INFORMATION THAT IF EXTRATERRESTRIALS FIND IT -- >> Stephen: LIKE THE ALBUM AND DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO GET TO EARTH. >> EXACTLY. I'M, LIKE, THAT'S MY ADDRESS, TOO! AND YOU JUST SENT IT OUT AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO FIND IT. AND BASED ON HISTORY, WHEN WE FIND EACH OTHER, WE KILL EACH OTHER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE ALIENS ARE GOING TO BE, LIKE, GREAT, LET'S GET ALONG! THEY MIGHT WANT TO DESTROY US! DON'T YOU SEE THE MOVIES? >> Stephen: YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE? >> YEAH. SOMETIMES I'M LIKE OH, WOW! THEN I'M, LIKE, OH, GOD! >> Stephen: YOU'RE VERY DEEP. YOU'RE VERY DEEP, TOO. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW HOW I CAN TELL YOU'RE DEEP? BECAUSE I'M AS DEEP AS YOU THINK I AM. >> WOW... THAT'S REALLY DEEP. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: WHENEVER I HAVE A GUEST ON WHO IS DEEP LIKE I AM, I ALWAYS LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO LIE ON A HILLSIDE AND ASK BIG QUESTIONS OF EVEN BIGGER STARS. ♪ MAN, LOOK AT THAT NIGHT SKY... IT'S LIKE A DEEP BLUE WATER WITH HANDLES ON THE BOTTOM. >> YEAH... UNDERWATER CANDLES. >> Stephen: FEELS LIKE IF WE JUST LET GO OF THIS HILL, WE COULD JUST FALL OFF INTO IT AND SWIM AROUND. >> YEAH... THE MILKY WAY WOULD BE OUR POOL NOODLE. >> Stephen: WOW... YEAH. >> Stephen: WOW. WOW. >> Stephen: HEY, JENNIFER? YEAH, STEPHEN? >> Stephen: DO YOU THINK WE CAN EVER TRULY BE HAPPY? >> ONLY WHEN YOU'RE A BABY AND YOU FIRST DISCOVER YOUR FEET. >(LAUGHTER) HEY, STEPHEN? >> Stephen: YEAH, JENNIFER? IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND GIVE YOURSELF A PIECE OF ADVICE, WHAT WOULD IT BE? >> Stephen: DON'T FORGET TO BUILD THE TIME MACHINE. (LAUGHTER) HEY, WHAT'S THE BIGGEST REGRET? >> NOT HELPING THAT RACCOON GET HIS HEAD OUT OF THE MAYONNAISE JAR. WHAT'S YOURS? >> Stephen: MY BIGGEST REGRET IS EATING THAT MAY NICE-COVERED RACCOON. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: DO YOU THINK THE COLORS I SEE ARE THE SAME COLORS YOU SEE? >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW... WHAT DOES BLUE LOOK LIKE TO YOU? >> Stephen: S?ORT OF -- (MAKING INDISTINGUISHABLE NOISES) (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: YEAH, BLUE. (LAUGHTER) I LOVE WINTER. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE SEASON? >> IT'S A TIE BETWEEN LOBSTER FEST AND TROYETIZON (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: WOULD YOU RATHER FLY OR BE INVIZ SNBL. >> I WOULD RATHER BE INVISIBLE AND I COULD JUST SAY, I'M FLYING, AND NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BEST PART OF CHRISTMAS IS? >> Stephen: I THINK IT'S THE WARM FEELINGS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT ME WHEN I SAY THAT THE BEST PART IS FAMILY. >> MMM... >> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS AFTER YOU DIE? >> I THINK THEY GIVE YOUR HOSPITAL BED TO SOMEONE ELSE. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE BURIED? >> TWO WORDS -- COFFIN, BOBSLED. (LAUGHTER) HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN THE END IS NEAR? >> Stephen: WHEN THE STAGE MANAGER TELLS US TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. AND THERE HE IS RIGHT NOW. "JOY" IS IN THEATERS CHRISTMAS DAY! JENNIFER LAWRENCE EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OH, LOOK! A SHOOTING STAR! OH! SO BEAUTIFUL! ( BAND PLAYING ) >> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS A WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE, AMERICA'S MOST RESPECTED PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN. PLEASE WELCOME, DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ( BAND PLAYING ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR COMING. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: GENTLEMEN, YOU MAY GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RECENT EMANCIPATION! THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS FIRST ON COMEDY CENTRAL, I SAID THEY WERE WERE -- I SAID LINCOLN WAS SEXY. >> Stephen: IN WHAT WAY? I THINK SEXY COMES FROM AN INTERNAL SPIRIT AND FIRE AND A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AND CONTAGION. HE ACTUALLY WAS BUFF. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HIM WITH NO CLOTHES ON, RIGHT? HE WIELDED AN AXE. SO HIS TOP WAS VERY -- >> Stephen: HE WAS RIPPED? WOW! WELL, YOU HAVE CERTAINLY MADE YOUR MARK ON PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY. A TEAM OF RIVALS ABOUT LINCOLN, A BULLY PULPIT ABOUT TAFT AND ROOSEVELT. LYNDON JOHNSON, AN AMERICAN DREAM, AND NO ORDINARY TIME, FRANKLIN AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, THE HOME FRONT IN WORLD WAR II. SO WE'VE COME TO THE PORTION OF THE SHOW WHERE I'M LEGALLY REQUIRED TO ASK YOU ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. ARE THERE PRECEDENTS IN AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY WHERE SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? BECAUSE HE'S VERY POPULAR. >> IT HAS TO DO WITH PERIODS OF FEAR AND ANXIETY. WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CAN PROMISE THINGS THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER BUT PEOPLE BELIEVE IT, LIKE SAYING WE'LL BUILD A WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT! BUT THE PROBLEM WITH DEMAGOGUES IS YOU MAKE PROMISES YOU CAN'T KEEP, LIKE I'LL NEVER DAPPOINT YOU. IF ANYONE MADE THAT PROMISE, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. >> Stephen: DEMAGOGUES HAVE RUN BEFORE BUT HAS YON GOT ONTO THE OVAL OFFICE BEFORE? >> GOOD QUESTION BUT, NO, I DON'T THINK SO. AFTER A WHILE, THE DISPARITY BETWEEN FACTS AND WHAT THE PERSON SAYS USUALLY GETS TO THEM. >> Stephen: RIGHT. LIKE HE SAID THINGS WE KNOW WEREN'T TRUE, LIKE HE'S SEEN THOUSANDS OF MUSLIMS. ALL POLITICIANS EXAGGERATE, THAT'S THEIR NATURE -- LIKE WHEN I KNEW LYNDON JOHNSON AND I WAS SWIMMING IN THE POOL WITH HIM AT THE RANCH -- >> Stephen: GO BACK. YOU WERE SWIMMING WITH LYNDON JOHNSON IN THE POOL AT HIS RANCH? >> AND THE GREAT THING IS IT HAD RAFTS WITH FLOATING TELEPHONES AND FLOATING MEMO AND NOTE PADS. THAT DAY HE HAD GIVE AN SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER DYING AT THE ALAMO AND IT WASN'T TRUE. AND I SAID HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? HE SAID THE JOURNALISTS ARE SUCH STICKLERS FOR THE DETAIL. THEY WILL ASK YOU ABOUT THE WALLPAPER IN THE ROOM YOU MADE LOVE. IT'S HARMLESS. EHE WANTED SOMEBODY LIKE THAT. BUT AFTER A WHILE YOUR CREDIBILITY IS NOT BELIEVED AND YOU LOSE TRUSTWORTHINESS ON VIETNAM, THAT'S WHEN THE CREDIBILITY GAP BEGINS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TRUMP IF HE GETS FURTHER ALONG WITH ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW ARE NOT TRUE AND HE COMES BACK AND SAYS IT IS TRUE, BUT NOBODY'S HOLDING HIM TO IT. >> Stephen: WE'RE ABOUT 50 DAYS AWAY FROM IOWA AND ANOTHER 10 TO 12 DAYS AWAY FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE LEADER AT THIS POINT IS GENERALLY P ONE WHO WINS NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE ONE WHO WINS NEW HAMPSHIRE IS USUALLY NOMINATED. IF HISTORY IS OUR GUY, DONALD TRUMP HAS A GOOD SHOT AT BEING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. >> UNLESS WHATEVER'S LEFT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES OUT SOMEONE TOLLS GO AGAINST THE FIGURES THEY DON'T WANT IN THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT COULD BE NOW. >> Stephen: HAS THERE ALWAYS BEEN A PARTY ESTABLISHMENT TO TURN OFF THE TAP OF INTEREST OR SUPPORT FOR A CANDIDATE? >> THE REASON THEY COULD IS THE PARTY BOSSES HAD CONTROL OF THE MONEY AND THEY'D GIVE THE MONEY TO WHOMEVER THEY WANT, BUT NOW HE'S SELF-FINANCED, SO IT'S MUCH HARDER AND JOURNALISTS LOVE IT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT'S ENTERTAINING AND I AGREE, TOO. HE'S NOT GETTING BAMBOOZLED. HE'S MADE 50 500 GAFFES AND HE'S STILL GOING. >> Stephen: YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM (LAUGHTER) >> I LOVE WHEN HE SAID, I'LL NEVER DISAPPOINT YOU AND BEYOND THAT HE SAID I'LL ALWAYS TELL YOU WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE IN THE UNLIKELY CHANCE I NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT KIND OF GUY? >> Stephen: YOU INVITE HIM ON YOUR SHOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PEOPLE DON'T WRITE EACH OTHER LETTERS ANYMORE. IS THAT MAKING IT HARDER -- THE TWEET SORT OF WAY OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER OR THE TEXTING WAY OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER, IS THAT MAKING IT HARDER WERE FUTURE HISTORIANS? >> WITHOUT QUESTION. I HAVE TO GO BACK 100 YEARS. THEY WROTE TEN-PAGE LETTERS TO THEIR WIFE SAYING HOW THEY FELT ABOUT LINCOLN OR TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND HAVE ROMANTIC STUFF MIXED IN. THEY KEPT DIARIES. WE WILL KNOW HOW WE WALKED AND TALKED AND LOOKED BUT WE WON'T HAVE THE INTIMATE DETAIL. MY GUYS ARE DEAD AND I NEED TO BRING THEM ALIVE THROUGH THIS KIND OF MATERIAL. I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE I'VE DONE SO. THE ONLY FEAR IS THERE WILL BE A PANEL IN THE AFTERLIFE AND ALL THE PRESIDENTS WILL BE THERE AND TELL ME EVERYTHING I GOT WRONG WITH THEM AND THE FIRST THING WILL BE LYNDON JOHNSON SAYING HOW COME THE BOOK ON THE DEN DIS WAS TIES TWICE AS LONG AS THE BOOK ABOUT ME? >> Stephen: I HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS BECAUSE I WANT YOU ON MANY MORE TIMES, BUT IF HE DOES YOU ASK HIM WHY HE LIED ABOUT THE ALAMO. >> LYNDON JOHNSON WAS SO SAD IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW HIS LEGACY WAS CUT IN TWO BY THE WAR IN VIETNAM, SO DEPRESSED I THINK HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO DIE. 50 YEARS LATER, MEDICAID, CIVIL RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, HE WOULD BE HAPPY IF WE WERE ALIVE AND I HOPE HE'S UP THERE SEEING HIS DOMESTIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND HIS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CONGRESS WHICH NO ONE CAN DO NOW IS GIVING HIM A PANTHEON. >> Stephen: DORIS, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> STEPHEN: HERE SINGING, "BURY OUR FRIENDS," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SLEATER-KINNEY!"
