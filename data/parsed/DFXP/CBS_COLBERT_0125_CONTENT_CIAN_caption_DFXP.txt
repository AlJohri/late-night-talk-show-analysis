>> Stephen: HELLO! WE'RE ON IN ONE MINUTE. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE? WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING? >> I'M WINNING, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING? BITE MY BIG APPLE. WOOO! >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES DENNIS QUAID. MATT WALSH. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY CHARLES BRADLEY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THAT'S VERY NICE. HEY! THANK YOU! THANKED EVERYBODY. THANKS DOWN HERE. >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN. >> Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE. I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT IN A WHILE.  ( CHEERS ) YOU'RE AWFULLY NICE. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE LATE "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE EXCITED. TODAY IS APRIL 20, A.K.A. 4/20. AND AS A LOT OF YOU SEEM TO ALREADY KNOW, 420 IS THE POLICE CODE FOR GETTING A CHEAP AUDIENCE REACTION. AND I KNOW THAT TODAY HAS A SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR MANY PEOPLE, INCLUDING, OF COURSE, MY INTERN, STONEY VON DANKINGTON. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, STONEY? >> HEY STEPHEN. WHAT DO MEAN, MAN? ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: ISN'T 4/20 A BIG DAY FOR YOU TO CELEBRATE? >> CELEBRATE WHAT? >> Stephen: YOU KNOW, GETTING HIGH. >> OH, TOTALLY. BECAUSE IT'S 44th ANNIVERSARY OF APOLLO 16 LANDING ON THE MOON. YOU DON'T GET MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT! >> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE. BUT ISN'T THIS A BIG DAY FOR, YOU KNOW, BLAZING UP? >> YEAH, YEAH, SURE IS. BECAUSE APRIL 20, 1865, WAS THE FIRST DAY THAT SAFETY MATCHES WERE ADVERTISED! TOTALLY, MAN. >> Stephen: NO, 4/20, 4/20. AREN'T YOU GOING TO CELEBRATE WITH A LITTLE TOKEY? >> UM, I THINK YOU'RE PRONOUNCING IT WRONG, STEPHEN. BUT YEAH, I AM GOING TO CELEBRATE THE 79th BIRTHDAY OF "STAR TREK'S" GEORGE TAKEI. LIVE LONG AND PROSPER, SULU! >> Stephen: OKAY, WE'VE GOT, LIKE, TEN MORE OF THESE JOKES. SHOULD I KEEP GOING? >> NAH, MAN, I THINK THEY KNOW THE BIT BY NOW. EVERYONE KNOWS. EVERYONE KNOWS. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WATCHING AT HOME ON 4/20. EVERYONE KNOWS. ( LAUGHTER ) >> EVERYONE. KNOWS. >> Stephen: WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU LATER STONEY! >> LATER, MAN! I'M GONNA GO SMOKE SOME MARIJUANA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: STONEY VON DANKINGTON, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE STAGE, SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: GOT A LITTLE COTTON MOUTH. RIGHT OFF THE BEAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO START WITH THE BIGGEST, BADDEST STORY OF TODAY, AND REALLY, EVERY DAY, THE STORY OF MONEY. AND I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR THIS STORY, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT MORE OF IT. BECAUSE EARLIER TODAY THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL BE REPLACING RENOWNED INDIAN-STABBER ANDREW JACKSON... I'M SORRY, NATIVE AMERICAN STABBER ANDREW JACKSON, ON THE 20 DOLLAR BILL WITH HARRIET TUBMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YUP. THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. HARRIET TUBMAN IS AN AMERICAN HERO, WHO RISKED HER LIFE REPEATEDLY TO FIGHT SLAVERY, SO AWKWARD IN YOUR WALLET WHEN SHE RUNS INTO  WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON. AND IT'S TRULY EXCITING TO HAVE A WOMAN ON THE 20. ALTHOUGH, UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO THE WAGE GAP, IT IS NOW WORTH $17. I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) APPLAUDING THE WAGE GAP. IT SHOULD NEVER-- I BELIEVE IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN THIS LONG. APPARENTLY, IN THE "WHAT TO PUT ON OUR MONEY" PRIORITY LIST, WOMAN AND AFRICAN AMERICAN BOTH CAME AFTER CYCLOPS PYRAMID. SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT MONEY CAN BUY. THE 2016 ELECTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DID YOU GUYS VOTE IN YESTERDAY'S NEW YORK PRIMARY ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GREAT. WELL, THAT MEANS YOU DID YOUR PART FOR DEMOCRACY, AND AS A REWARD, YOU'RE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR JURY DUTY. AND THE RESULTS WERE A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED EMPIRE STATE BOOT STOMPING BY HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP. NEW YORKERS HAVEN'T SEEN A THRASHING THIS BAD SINCE ANY KNICKS GAME. ( LAUGHTER ) ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, IT WAS A TOUGH CHOICE FOR NEW YORKERS. YOU GO TO THE POLLS, YOU SEE OLD LADIES WORKING THERE, AND YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM HAPPY, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW. HAVE THEY BEEN WAITING THEIR WHOLE LIVES FOR A WOMAN PRESIDENT, OR ARE THEY FRIENDS WITH BERNIE FROM AQUAEROBICS? ( LAUGHTER ) COULD BE UPON. WHAT REALLY IMPRESSED ME LAST NIGHT WAS THE WAY CNN ANNOUNCED THE WINNERS. >> TONIGHT THE WINNERS OF THE NEW YORK PRIMARY WILL HAVE THEIR VICTORIES DISPLAYED ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. THE LIGHTS WILL CHANGE TO CORRESPOND TO THE COLORS THAT CNN IS USING TO REPRESENT EACH CANDIDATE. CNN HAS PROJECTED DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE WINNER OF THE NEW YORK REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. WE ARE TURNING THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING THE DARK CRIMSON, THE RED ,THAT SIGNIFIES DONALD TRUMP. >> Stephen: YES, DARK CRIMSON AGAINST A JET BLACK SKY. A COLOR COMBINATION THAT TRULY SCREAMS GOOD TIDINGS FOR MANKIND. ( LAUGHTER ) STILL, I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR THAT CNN GETS TO CONTROL THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. THEY ALREADY HAVE A BEAM OF RADIANT LIGHT THAT DELIVERS THE NEWS: ANDERSON COOPER. ( LAUGHTER ).  ( CHEERS ) OOOH! I AM BLIND! I AM BLIND! THAT'S WHY I AM  ALSO GOING TO START MAKING ANDERSON COOPER ANNOUNCEMENTS VIA COLORFUL LIGHTS, RIGHT UP HERE ON MY "LATE SHOW" SIGN. IT'S BLUE RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WON THE NEW YORK PRIMARY. AND IT WORKS FOR ALL NEWS. IF THE STOCK MARKET GOES UP, IT'S GREEN. AND IF YOU EVER SEE THIS, THERE'S A FROOT LOOPS RECALL. OF COURSE, THE CLEAREST MESSAGE COMING OUT OF NEW YORK LAST NIGHT WAS, "SUCK IT, TED CRUZ. SUCK OUR NEW YORK VALUES." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE-- CRUZ GOT JUST 15% OF THE VOTE, AND IN ONE COUNTY, HE EVEN LOST TO BEN CARSON, WHO DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE A MONTH AGO. THOUGH, TO BE FAIR, DR. CARSON MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT HE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE. SHHH! SHHH! BUT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS BEATEN LIKE A SPEEDBAG IN A LOOSE SUIT, AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, TED CRUZ MANAGED TO KEEP IT POSITIVE AND ALSO KIND OF CREEPY. >> AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN BEST WHEN SHE IS LYING DOWN WITH HER BACK ON THE MAT. >> Audience: OOOOH! >> Stephen: THAT IS WHEN AMERICA IS AT HER BEST-- LYING DOWN WITH HER BACK ON THE MAT, LIGHTS ON, AND WITH A FIRM HANDSHAKE, AND THEN BACK TO YOUR SEPARATE BEDS FOR QUIET WEEPING. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. FOR TRUMP, OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS TOTAL DOMINATION. HE WON 60% OF THE VOTE, TAKING EVERY DISTRICT EXCEPT ONE, MANHATTAN, WHICH WENT TO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH. AFTER PICKING UP 90 DELEGATES TRUMP HAS HIS SIGHTS SET ON THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND. THIS LOGO REPRESENTS THE ROCK 'N' ROLL HALL OF FAME, SO MUCH BETTER THAN CLEVELAND'S ORIGINAL CHOICE, AN ELEPHANT WALKING ON HALF OF LeBRON JAMES. BUT THIS IS LIKELY GOING TO BE A CONTESTED CONVENTION, WHERE IF NO ONE WINS THE FIRST ROUND OF VOTING, DELEGATES CAN SWITCH THEIR VOTES TO ANY OTHER CANDIDATE THEY WANT. AND IT IS NOT AGAINST THE RULES TO WOO THESE DELEGATES WITH ANY GIFTS, INCLUDING MONEY OR JOBS OR THE MOST PRECIOUS PRIZE OF ALL: A TICKET OUT OF CLEVELAND. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, DONALD TRUMP HAS A VERY STRONG STANCE ON THIS TYPE OF BRIBERY. >> IT'S A CORRUPT AND CROOKED SYSTEM. >> Stephen: OKAY, CORRUPT AND CROOKED, SO CLEARLY HE'S NOT GOING TO ENGAGE-- >> LOOK, NOBODY HAS BETTER TOYS THAN I DO. I CAN PUT THEM IN THE BEST PLANES AND BRING THEM TO THE BEST RESORTS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. DORAL, MAR-A-LAGO. YOU'RE BASICALLY BUYING THESE PEOPLE. >> Stephen: OKAY, SO HE MIGHT BRIBE THEM A LITTLE BIT. BUT ALL THIS SCHEMING AND OVERT DISCUSSION OF BRIBERY I BELIEVE HAS TURNED WHAT SHOULD BE A DIGNIFIED PROCESS OF THE TRANSFER OF POWER INTO A CARTOONISH FARCE. FOR MORE ON THAT, PLEASE WELCOME BACK, CARTOON DONALD TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, MR. CARTOON TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> HELLO ,NEW YORK! BOW BEFORE ME! YOU HAVE MADE ME YOUR EMPEROR! WOO! WOO! >> Stephen: THANK YOU. WOO, INDEED. WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING SOME PANTS ON. >> IT'S A SHAME. EVERYONE SAYS IT-- I HAVE AMAZING KNEES. I SHOULD BE A KNEE MODEL. TREMENDOUS. >> Stephen: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORY LAST NIGHT. >> WOO! FEELING GOOD! DANCE WITH ME, STEPHEN, COME ON! DANCE WITH ME. SHAKE IT, DON'T BREAK IT, IT TOOK YOUR MOMMA NINE MONTHS TO MAKE IT. YEAH, I BEAT TED CRUZ, OR AS I CALL HIM, "DEAD LOSE." GET IT, STEPHEN? BECAUSE HE LOST, AND HE LOOKS LIKE A DEAD PERSON BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE. HE'S THE WALKING TED BECAUSE HE'S BARELY RUNNING. I COULD GO ON ALL NIGHT. UNLIKE TED CRUZ AND HIS TINY CANADIAN PENIS. UP TOP! >> Stephen: NOW, YOU'VE SAID YOU  >> Stephen: OKAY, THERE YOU GO. >> DOWN LOW. YOU. >> Stephen:  SAID-- I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT-- YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BRING A TOUCH OF SHOW BIZ TO THE CONVENTION. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? >> THAT'S RIGHT, DEMOCRACY IS A SNOOZE-FEST, GOT TO ZAZZ IT UP. AND I'VE GOT GLITZ AND GLAMOUR COMING OUT OF MY RAZMATAZZ-HOLE >> Stephen: I'M SORRY, YOUR WHAT? >> NEAR THE RECTUM. RECTUM-ADJACENT. TRUST ME. >> Stephen: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THAT CLASSY. THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU. >> THAT'S WHAT I DO. >> Stephen: AND HOW WILL THE GLITZ AND THE GLAMOR TRANSLATE TO THE CONVENTION? >> GLAD YOU ASKED. FIRST, I GOLD PLATE THE ENTIRE CITY OF CLEVELAND, INCLUDING THE PEOPLE. THEN I RIDE IN ON A CHARIOT PULLED BY SHOWGIRLS DRESSED LIKE LADY LIBERTY. AND UNLIKE THE REAL STATUE, THESE GIRLS ARE TENS. IT'S A TOTAL GAM SESSION. THEN I TAKE MY THRONE AND ANNOUNCE MY VICE PRESIDENT, OPTIMUS PRIME. TOGETHER, WE WILL TRANSFORM AMERICA TO BE GREAT AGAIN! ROLL CREDITS. >> Stephen: OKAY, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY, THAT'S A LOVELY PLAN. THAT'S IF YOU WIN. WHAT IF OTHER CAMPAIGNS TRY CAMPAIGNS TRY TO BRIBE YOUR DELEGATES WITH FREE STUFF? >> BRING IT. NOBODY CAN BEAT ME IN TOYS. I'M TALKING JETS, BOUNCY CASTLES, ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT SHRIMP, ARSENIO HALL'S THERE, HE'S DRESSED LIKE A SHRIMP, AND HE WILL FIGHT MEAT LOAF, WHO'S DRESSED AS A MEATLOAF. >> Stephen: THAT CERTAINLY DOES SOUND NICE. BUT WHAT IF TED CRUZ OUTSPENDS YOU? >> OH, I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM TRY, BECAUSE THE WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR RAIN, BABY, RAIN. PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF BEN FRANK LANGUAGES. OH, AND HARRIET TUBMAN. BLACK PEOPLE LOVE ME. >> Stephen: WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF CASH, SIR. >> COME ON, PUT 'EM ON THE GLASS, STEPHEN! GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT! >> Stephen: I CAN'T DO THAT. BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY GIVING OUT THAT KIND OF CASH, I WISH I WAS A DELEGATE. >> WAIT, YOU'RE NOT A DELEGATE? WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE? >> Stephen: YOU'RE ON TV, FOR ONE. >> STEPHEN, I'M ALWAYS ON TV, CNN, FOX, ANIMAL PLANET, THE GOLF CHANNEL. >> Stephen: DID YOU SAY ANIMAL PLANET? >> THEY LOVE ME. I'M THE HOST OF THE NEW "MEERKAT MANOR." >> Stephen: YOU'RE HOSTING THE SHOW? >> NO, I'M HOSTING THE MEERKATS. THEY'RE LIVING IN MY HAIR. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT LITTLE FELLA. HE'S FABULOUS. HIS NAME'S FABERGE. IT'S A TAX WRITE-OFF. PLUS, HE KILLS ALL THE FIELD MICE UP THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. >> Stephen: CARTOON DONALD TRUMP, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> Stephen: JON, THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. WHO IS JOINING YOU? >> CONTEMPORARIES OF MILES DAVIS, JOHN COAL TRAIN, THE HEATH BROTHERS, Y'ALL. >> Stephen: THE HEATH BROTHERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WE'LL BE CHECKING IN A LITTLE BIT LATER TO SAY HI IN THE SHOW. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE'LL BE SAYING HI LATER. BY THE WAY, I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT, JON. THAT IS SPRINGTIME. I DON'T THINK I COULD GET AWAY WITH THAT OUTFIT. >> Jon: OH, MAN, YOU CAN PULL IT OFF. YOU'RE FAMOUS. >> Stephen: ON ME IT WOULD LOOK LIKE I WAS WEARING A COUCH. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS. HIS LATEST PROJECT IS AN ONLINE DRAMA CALLED "THE ART OF MORE." PLEASE WELCOME DENNIS QUAID! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: I DON'T USUALLY BEAT MY GUEST TO THE DESK THAT FAST. I'M SORRY. I SPRINTED. >> WOW, YOU'RE FAST. >> Stephen: YEAH, I AM. I'M FAST BUT YOU'RE FIT. THAT KIND OF BUGS ME ABOUT YOU. YEAH. WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER. WE'LL GET TO MY ANGER ABOUT YOUR FITNESS A LITTLE BIT LATER. FIRST, I UNDERSTAND YOU CAME HERE ALL THE WAY FROM ICELAND? >> YEAH, I WAS IN EASTERN ICELAND YESTERDAY. >> Stephen: EASTERN ICELAND. IS IT BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE AN EASTERN AND WESTERN. >> REYKJAVIK IS IN THE WEST, AND THAT'S WHERE 298,000 OF THE 300,000 PEOPLE IN ICE LAND LIVE. AND THIS IS AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN GET. IT'S BEAUTIFUL OVER THERE. >> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN ICELAND? >> I WAS SHOOTING A SERIES OVER-- FOR SKY TV OVER THERE. >> Stephen: I LOVE-- I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A MAGICAL PLACE. >> IT IS. IT'S LIKE-- IT'S-- IT'S LIKE HAWAII IN THE ARCTIC. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: ASSOCIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE WITH-- EVERYTHING YOU ASSOCIATE WITH HAWAII, TAKE ALL OF IT AWAY. THAT'S ICELAND. >> YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: I WAS GIVEN THIS PHOTO BY ONE OF MY PRODUCERS, AND WHAT IS THIS? I SAW-- >> THAT IS THE SEVENTH HOLE AT THE GOLF COURSE WHERE I PLAYED LAST WEEK. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: YOU WERE PLAYING GOFT LAST WEEK IN ICELAND? >> YEAH. A GLACIER CAME THROUGH AND TOOK THE GREEN OUT, SO THEY PUT UP A LITTLE MOUND FOR US. I HAD TO. >> Stephen: ARE YOU PLAYING IN SNOW AND ICE FOR THE WHOLE THING? >> NO, AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S NOT COMPLETELY DONE THERE. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH ORANGE BALLS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? >> NOT THAT DAY, NO. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> SO IT WAS FUN. >> Stephen: NOW, LET'S GET TO MY REAL BEEF WITH YOU, AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE BEEF WITH YOU. LOOK AT THAT. YOU'RE A 62-YEAR-OLD MAN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING-- >> I LOOK LIKE I'M ABOUT TO START A FIGHT. >> Stephen: YEAH. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO TAKE SOMEBODY. >> WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOOKING AT MY GIRL! >> Stephen: AS SOMEONE WHO IS 10 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU ARE, I'M OFFENDED BY THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT TAKING OFF MY SHIRT IN PUBLIC. WHAT I'M HERE TO ASK YOU IS, ARE YOU JUICING, DENNIS QUAID? THIS IS A SAFE PLACE. >> I'M HERE TO PROMOTE MY SIX-MINUTE ABS PROGRAM. >> Stephen: THAT'S IT? SIGN ME UP, MAN. SIGN ME UP. NOW, YOU'VE GOT A SERIES NOW WHICH JUST GOT PICKED UP FOR THE SECOND SERIES ON CRACKLE-- THE SECOND SEASON ON CRACKER CALLED "THE ART OF MORE," WHERE YOU PLAY, LIKE, A NEW YORK BILLIONAIRE, MAN ABOUT UP TO. >> HE'S A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, AND HE HAS POLITICAL AMBITIONS. >> Stephen: OH, REALLY. WHERE DO YOU GET THESE IDEAS, DENNIS QUAID? >> I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. >> IN FACT, ALL THE-- ALL 10 EPISODES WERE WRITTEN BEFORE WE STARTED, AND WE HAD BEEN SHOOTING FOR, LIKE, TWO MONTHS, AND WHEN TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AND IT WAS-- WE THOUGHT WE WERE OUTRAGEOUS AND THEN HE CAME ALONG. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, HE'S SOMEWHAT LIKE TRUMP, I GUESS, A LITTLE BIT. >> Stephen: BUT NOT SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD SUE YOU. >> TRUMP IS MAYBE A LITTLE KINDER AND SOFTER. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP RIGHT HERE OF YOUR CHARACTER EXPRESSING WHY HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE IN THE POLITICAL ARENA. JIM. >> THAT IS SUCH SUNDAY SCHOOL HORSE ( BLEEP ). IF YOU ASK ME, PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH THESE DO-NOTHING, TWO-FACED POLITICIANS. THEY WANT SOMETHING REAL, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM, AND I AM NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR MY LIFE. A MAN OF GREAT PASSION WHO WORKED HIMSELF UP FROM NOTHING TO THE EPITOME OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND, YES, HE MADE A FEW MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, BUT HE LEARNED FROM THEM, AND HE GREW FROM THEM. AND BECAUSE OF THEM, IT GIVES ME MORE EMPATHY AND MORE UNDERSTANDING FOR THE COMMON MAN. >> Stephen: IT DOES SEEM FAMILIAR. >> YUP. >> Stephen: THAT DOES SEEM FAMILIAR.  ( APPLAUSE ) THE SHOW SEEMS TO BE ABOUT-- >> IT'S ART AUCTION HOUSES AND IT'S INTERESTED HERE, CENTERED HERE IN NEW YORK BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT DESIRE, GREED, LUST, ENVY AND ALL THE BEST OF HUMANITY. >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE-- >> IT'S DELICIOUS. >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU DESIRE, DENNIS? >> YEAH. I'M NOT IN WANT OF ANYTHING. >> Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS. YOU HAVE AN EIGHT-PACK. >> TO THE A GREAT FAMILY. >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE-- LIKE IN THIS, THIS IS SORT OF THE APPEAL OF THIS IS YOU GET TO PEER INTO THIS WORLD WHERE THERE'S ALWAYS DESIRE AND THE CARROT AND WANTING MORE AND MORE. >> AND YOU GET TO SEE RICH PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING MISERABLE LIVES FOR SOME REASON. >> Stephen: YEAH, THAT'S REALLY NICE. BUT YOU AND I ARE RICH, AND WE BOTH KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU THIS ISN'T PLEASANT. IT'S ACTUALLY VERY, VERY NICE. >> IT'S TRUE. >> Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE COMMERCIAL BREAK. YOU CAN STICK AROUND? >> I CERTAINLY CAN. I CERTAINLY WANT TO. >> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE GREAT DENNIS QUAID, EVERYBODY. >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, WE'RE HERE WITH DENNIS QUAID. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SERIES, "THE ART OF MORE," IS ABOUT IS IS THAT YOUR CHARACTER HAS A LOT OF MEMORABILIA THAT THESE TWO ART-- THESE AUCTION HOUSES IN NEW YORK WANT TO GET THE RIGHTS TO AUCTION OFF. >> YES. >> Stephen: DO YOU YOURSELF-- YOU'RE A FAMOUS GUY WHO HAS DONE A LOT OF STUFF-- DO YOU YOURSELF HAVE MEM BIE PEOPLE BIELEIA THAT IS PRECIOUS TO YOU? >> I HAVE STUFF. >> Stephen: IF YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN WHAT WOULD YOU GET? >> RIGHT STUFF JACKET THAT I WORE IN THE MOVIE "THE RIGHT STUFF." >> Stephen: AS GORDO COOPER. >> I STILL HAVE MY JACKET.

YOU THINK, THE THINGS YOU MISS. >> Stephen: YOU GOTTA GET YOUR GUGY. CAN WE TALK ABOUT GORDO COOPER FOR A SECOND. IT'S MY FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM "THE RIGHT STUFF." IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. DID YOU GET TO MEET HIM? >> I GREW UP IN HOUSTON. I WAS SIX WHEN THE ASTRONAUTS CAME ON, WANTED TO BE A COWBOY, AND GORDO COOPER WAS MY FAVORITE ASTRONAUT BACK THEN. HE WAS LIKE THE ROCK 'N' ROLL GUY. WHEN I GOT THE PART, WHICH I COULDN'T BELIEVE, I FOUND OUT HE LIVED THREE MILES FROM ME IN L.A. AND MET HIM. AND HE-- >> Stephen: DID HE LIKE YOUR PORTRAYAL? BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY COCKY. >> WE BECAME GOOD FRIENDS, IN FACT. >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. FRIENDS WITH AN ASTRONAUT! >> YEAH. IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING. >> Stephen: THAT'S PRETTY GREAT. >> YEAH, IT GOT ME-- TURNED ME ON TO MY FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR, AND I LEARNED TO FLY BECAUSE OF THAT. >> Stephen: YOU'RE A PILOT? >> YEAH, FLY JETS. >> Stephen: YOU FLY JETS? THAT'S CRAZY. THE JETS AND THE ACTING AND THE ABS? MY GOD. ( LAUGHTER ) THE ANGER JUST FLOWS. DO YOU-- ARE YOU STILL, LIKE, A FAN OF SPACE AND EVERYTHING? ARE YOU INTERESTED IN SPACE AND SPACE TRAVEL. DO YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT THAT STUFF? >> THE GRAVITY WAVES THEY JUST FOUND OUT. >> Stephen: AMAZING. WE HAD BRIAN GREEN ON HERE TO EXPLAIN THE GRAVITY WAVES. PASS, RIGHT NOW THROUGH YOUR BODY. DIBLOW YOUR MIND? >> YES YOU DID. >> Stephen: YOU WANTED TO BE A COWBOY AND AN THEN AN SMAWFT. >> IF YOU'RE AN ACTOR YOU GET TO BE A COWBOY AND AN ASTRONAUT CAN AND BE ON YOUR SHOW. >> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE.

MY SON IS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. HE'S ON "VINEIL" SCORSESE'S SERIES. >> Stephen: YOUR SON JACK. DO YOU GIVE ANY ADVICE? >> DON'T BUMP INTO THE FURNITURE. LEARN YOUR LINES AND DON'T BUMP INTO THE IF YOU WEREATURE. HE'S DONE IT ALL ON HIS OWN. I OFFERED TO HELP HIM, AND HE SAID HE WANTED TO DO IT ON HIS OWN AND HE'S WORKING FOR SCORSESE.

WENDY AND I ARE ADOPTING A BABY FROM CHINA. WE WERE KEEPING IT A SECRET UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. ACTUALLY, WENTDY WAS KEEPING IT A SECRET FROM ME. I'M GOING TO BE A DAD. >> WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TIE ELECTION. THERE IS NO TIME FOR SOME CHINESE BABY. CANCEL IT AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET YOUR MONEY BACK. >> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MATT WALSH. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: SO NICE TO SEE YOU. >> SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.

YOU WERE THERE WHEN I WAS THERE. >> NO, YOU WERE THERE, AND YOU WERE A VERY GOOD MENTOR. >> Stephen: I WAS A MENTOR? >> A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I WAS NEW, AND I WOULD SAY, "WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?" AND YOU SAID, "JUST GET READY TO SELL YOUR SOUL." >> Stephen: NO, WAIT A SECOND. I DID NOT SAY "SELL." I DID NOT SAY "SELL." WHAT I SAID WAS BEFORE YOU GO OUT INTO THE FIELD, BEFORE YOU SHOOT A FIELD PIECE, TAKE YOUR SAUSOUL OFF AND PUT IT ON A HANGER SO YOU DON'T GET IT POINTY AND YOU GET DIRTY IN THE FIELD AND PUT IF BACK ON WHEN YOU GET HOME. DON'T FORGET WHERE YOU PUT YOUR SOUL. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. >> AND I ALSO REMEMBER YOU WOULD GET ON THE P.A. SYSTEM IN THE OFFICE ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS -- >> WE HAD A LITTLE 711 THAT WE COULD TALK TO EVERYBODY. >> AND YOU WOULD SAY, "IF ANYONE HAS FOUND MY DVD OF "INDJANNA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF ( BLEEP )" PLEASE RETURN IT TO MY OFFICE, "INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF ( BLEEP )." >> Stephen: FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS NOT "INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF ( BLEEP )." IT WAS SAN FERNANDO JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF ( BLEEP ). >> YOU REMEMBER THE QUOTES BETTER. YOU'RE LIKE A LIVING MEMOIR. >> Stephen: OCCASIONALLY, THAT THING WOULD GO MISSING. OKAY, "VEEP," LET'S TALK "VEEP" FOR A SECOND. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: I LOVE "VEEP." I'VE SEEN-- BECAUSE I'M SPECIAL, I HAVE SEEN THREE OF THIS SEASON ALREADY. IT'S SO GREAT. IT'S SO DUMB AND SO INFURIATING AND SO FANTASTIC AND SO SELFISH AND SO HUMAN. >> SHE'S AWFUL. >> Stephen: ALL OF YOU ARE AWFUL PEOPLE ON "VEEP." THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT REALLY POLITICAL. IT'S JUST ABOUT HOW AWFUL HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE TO EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE AFRAID, REALLY. >> YES, IT IS, AND WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH OR PERCEIVED TO BE HIGH. THERE IS LOYALTY, BUT, YEAH, WE'RE TERRIBLE TO EACH OTHER, ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE SHOW IS YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT POLITICAL PARTY ANY OF YOU ARE WORKING FOR. >> THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE. >> Stephen: AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT? BECAUSE IT'S SO-- WE'RE ALL SO FINE TUNED TO WHERE WE SIT IN THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AND WHO IS ON WHAT SIDE. HOW DO YOU KEEP IT? IT'S IMPROVISED. A FAIR AMOUNT OF IT IS IMPROVISED. >> YES. IT'S IMPROVISED IN THE REHEARSAL ROOM. THE WRITERS SIT IN THE REHEARSAL. THE SCRIPTS COME IN VERY GOOD, AND WE PUT THE SCRIPT DOWN AND TAKE NOTES AND THE DRAFT WILL REFLECT A LOT OF THINGS WE DISCOVER IN REHEARSAL. ON THE DAY, IF WE'RE RUNNING ON TIME WE GET A FREE TAKE WHERE YOU CAN "F" AROUND AND SOMETIMES YOU DISCOVER THINGS IN THOSE MOMENTS. AND I CAN ALWAYS PITCH JOKES, ET CETERA, SO IT'S VERY COLLABORATIVE. >> Stephen: IF THEY DON'T WANT TO INDICATE WHAT POLITICAL PARTY YOU'RE IN, IF YOU IMPROVISE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION, DO YOU MENTION A NAME OR ISSUE AND SAY WE KNOW WHAT PARTY YOU'RE IN. "YOU KNOW, I THINK SCIENCE EXISTS." "NO, NO, NO, DON'T SAY THAT, BECAUSE THEN WE KNOW WHAT PARTY." >> I DON'T KNOW HOW WE AVOID IT BUT WE JUST DO. I GUESS WE BELIEVE IN IN THE CHARACTERS IN THE WORLD AND IT'S HARD NOT TO REFERENCE SOMETHING-- ONE THING WE DO I THINK THE CURRENT MOST POLITICAL CHARACTER WE'VE REFERENCED IS JIMMY CARTER. SO EVERYTHING POST-CARTER IS FICTION. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
