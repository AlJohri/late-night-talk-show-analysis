IF THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THE SHOW'S BEEN ON FOR ALMOST 30 SECONDS AND I HAVE YET TO SAY THE WORDS "DONALD TRUMP." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ON ME. AND WHAT'S GOTTEN ME WORRIED IS THAT SOON I MIGHT NOT HAVE A REASON TO BECAUSE HE'S SLUMPING IN THE POLLS. THAT WAS A ROLLER COASTER RIDE OF EMOTION BY THE WAY. OOOH-AAAY"P." LISTEN, I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUTING THIS. YES, HE HAS BEEN DIVISIVE. YES, HE HAS BEEN OFFENSIVE. YES, HE WOULD BE A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THIS-- DON'T LEAVE ME, DONALD. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, IF YOU GO AWAY, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE OTHER BORING PEOPLE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN THEIR NAMES. I THINK ONE OF THEM IS MARCO RUBIO. AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT? IS IT MARCO RUBIO. OR IS IT MARK O'RUBIO? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND FOR THE RECORD, I WAS JUST CROSSING TWO CULTURES. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, FAITH AND BEGORRAH. FIRST UP, I'LL BE TALKING TO JOHN OLIVER. HE'S THE HOST OF HBO-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S THE HOST OF "LAST WEEK TONIGHT" ON HBO, SO WE'LL BE DOING THE INTERVIEW WITH FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. HE IS THE LEAD CHARACTER OF THAT SHOW AND VERY POPULAR SO THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO KILL HIM OFF THIS SEASON. I'LL ALSO BE TALKING TO EVAN SPIEGEL, THE WORLD'S YOUNGEST BILLIONAIRE AND THE COFOUNDER OF SNAPCHAT. NOW, IF SOME OF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, ASK YOUR KIDS. IT WILL BE THE APP THEY'RE USING WHEN THEY IGNORE YOUR QUESTION. AND I'LL BE JOINED BY ED SHEERAN AND LEGENDARY SINGER/SONGWRITER BILL WITHERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ED IS GOING TO PERFORM WHITHER'S CLASSIC "AIN'T NO SUNSHINE." AND AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN ENGLAND, ED SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE RELATING. ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, WAIT. OH.

STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: WOW. THAT'S VERY NICE. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, LIKE MY FELLOW MILLENNIALS-- ( LAUGHTER ) AND I BELIEVE I AM A MILLENNIAL BECAUSE I AM LESS THAN A THOUSAND YEARS OLD-- I'M A TECHNOLOGY GEEG. I DRIVE A TESLA, OWN AN APPLE WATCH, I SHAVE WITH FIVE BLADES-- FIRST BLADE LIFTS, SECOND BLADE CUTS, THE OTHER THREE BLADES TWEET MY SHAVING STATS. GOT A NEW HIGH SCORE TODAY. AND THE LUBRICATING STRIP MAKES IT ALL GOOD. AND THE TECHNOLOGY OF ALL KIND CIEWND IS DRIVING THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. IN FACT, ONE OF MY GUESTS TONIGHT IS THE C.E.O. OF SNAPCHAT, EVAN SPIEGEL. HE'S BEEN CALLED THE STEVE JOBS OF SELF-ERASING GENITAL PHOTOGRAPHY-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YES, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SIR. AND HE'S HAVING AN IMPACT IN 2016. SOME IN THE MEDIA ARE ALREADY CALLING THIS CAMPAIGN THE SNAPCHAT ELECTION. AND IT'S TRUE-- CANDIDATES APPEAR AND, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THEY'RE GONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHAT! WHERE DID YOU GO? AND IT'S NOT JUST SNAPCHAT. FOLKS, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT TO GET SHAKEN BY ANOTHER SEE, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR FIRST DEBATE ON OCTOBER 13. I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THE CANDIDATES AND ALSO WHOEVER THREE GUYS ARE DOWN HERE. ( APPLAUSE ) I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS. I THINK THAT'S MADE UP. ANYWAY, AND CNN IS PROMISING TO BRING THIS ELECTION IN YOUR FACE BY PUTTING IT ON YOUR FACE.
SUSTAIN SUDDEN IS TURNING UP THE TECHNOLOGY AS WE GET DEEPER INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. NEXT MONTH IT WILL BREAK NEW GROUND BY LIVE STREAMING THE NEXT PRIMARY DEBATE IN VIRTUAL REALITY WITH THE HELP OF A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET USERS CAN ACTUALLY WATCH THE DEBATES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN AUDIENCE MEMBER.
Stephen: WHOO-HOO! THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN AUDIENCE MEMBER. YOUR VIEW CAN DP FROM THIS TO THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S REALLY EASY. ANYONE WITH A SAMSUNG GEAR V.R. HEADSET CAN PICK THEIR OWN POINT OF VIEW AND, EVEN BETTER, FOCUS ON CANDIDATES WHILE THEY ARE NOT SPEAKING. FOLKS, THE FUTURE WE WERE PROMISED BY "JOHNNY MNEMONIC," "VIRTUOSITY" AND YOUR CHILDHOOD VIEWMASTER HAS FINALL ARRIVED BECAUSE I BELIEVE-- BECAUSE WE'VE ALL DREAMT OF A FULLY IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE COULD WATCH LINCOLN CHAFEE TAKE NOTES WHILE SOMEONE ELSE TALKS. AND THIS TECH PUTS YOU IN THE CENTER OF THE ACTION. IT'LL FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SEEING HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, BUT SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY THERE-- JUST LIKE THE REAL HILLARY CLINTON! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. I CAN'T WAIT TO EXPERIENCE A DEBATE LIKE THIS. AND LUCKILY I DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE SAMSUNG GAVE ME MY OWN PAIR OF V.R. GOGGLES. IT IS ABSOLUTELY FREE. GOOD TO BE ME. ANYWAY, AND I DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OCTOBER 13, BECAUSE CNN CAPTURED THE LAST REPUBLICAN DEBATE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY AND HAS MADE IT AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD NOW. YES, WITH THESE BAD BOYS STRAPPED ON I CAN SUMMIT EVEREST, FLY ON A DRAGON OR STAND 20 FEET AWAY FROM MIKE HUCKABEE. THAT-- THAT ADVENTURE IS USUALLY RESERVED IF FOR A DUGGAR. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. I'M READY TO GET EXPANSIONAL. IT'S GO TIME. I'LL PUT THIS BAD BOY ON. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. I GOT THIS THING. ARE WE FIRED UP HERE? LET ME START UP THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE. WOW! WOW! LOOK AT THAT ( BLEEP ).

WOW, IT'S KIND OF WEIRD BEING HERE IN PERSON ON TV. YOU KNOW WHO'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CAMERA'S POINTED AT THEM, AND WHOEVER'S ON SCREEN SEEMS IMPORTANT AND KIND OF SEXY. BUT NOW I CAN SEE ALL THE CAMERAS AND THE LIGHTS AND THE SOUND GUYS. THIS ISN'T SEXY. THIS IS LIKE I'M WATCHING SOMEBODY SHOOT A PORNO. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO START WATCHING THESE DEBATES WITH MY PANTS OFF. BUT I GOTTA SAY, IT REALLY WORKS. IT REALLY FEELS LIKE I'M HERE, LIKE CAN REACH OUT AND ACTUALLY TOUCH RAND PAUL'S HAIR. OH, IT'S LIKE STROKING A LIBERTARIAN LABRADOODLE. OH, THE DEBATE IS STARTING. THE DEBATE'S STARTING. OKAY. HEY, BUDDY, HOW LONG DOES THIS THING GO? THREE HOURS.

THANK YOU.
Stephen: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BRIEFLY THE FEW TIMES I'VE SEEN YOU OVER LAST COUPLE OF YEARS BUT YOU ARE SETTING THE WORLD AFIRE.
WOW. IT'S A PRETTY SMALL BLAZE IF THAT'S TRUE. IT WOULD WARM A SINGLE HUMAN HAND.
Stephen: YES, WELL, LISTEN, THEY SAY IF YOU CAN WARM ONE HUMAN HAND, IT'S WORTH IT.
WE HAVE THE KIND OF HEAT THAT COULD POSSIBLY TOAST A MARSHMALLOW.

I DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: YOU DON'T HASH IT ON THE WALL LIKE A PRISONER?
I COUNT HOW MANY WE'VE GOT LEFT. WE HAVE SEVEN LEFT, I CAN TELL YOU THAT, SEVEN SHOWS LEFT.
Stephen: AND HOW LONG IS THE SHOW?
30 MINUTES.
Stephen: IT'S 30 MINUTES LONG. AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO IT?
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANGRY BY THE ANSWER SO DON'T ASK QUESTIONS YOU DON'T WANT THE ANSWER TO.
Stephen: I KNOW THE ANSWER. I WANT YOU TO SAY IT. HOW MANY DO YOU DO A WEEK?
A WHOLE HALF HOUR A WEEK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE FOR A DISCIPLINED HEROIN USER HALF AN HOUR A WEEK OF RIDING THE "H" TRAIN.
Stephen: THEERS WHAT I SINCERELY WANT TO KNOW. YOU GUYS HAVE GOT A GREAT ORGANIZATION, REALLY HILARIOUS, GREAT WRITERS A BIG LASER TO POINT AT A SUBJECT. HOW DO YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT TO POINT AT BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT 18 MINUTES INVESTED IN A SINGLE SUBJECT. YOU GET NINE MINUTES INTO YOUR PERFORMANCE AND GO, THIS, BORES ME." ISN'T THERE A DANGER ONLY ONE SUBJECT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOW?
IT IS. IF YOU SAID WHAT OUR SHOW ACTUALLY WAS TO SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T WATCH IT, IT WOULD SOUND TERRIBLE.
Stephen: AND NOW 18 MINUTES ON TAINTED MEAT.
EXACTLY. IF YOU SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO HEAR 20 MINUTES ON THE CONTRACTS THAT CHICKEN FARMERS HAVE TO SIGN?" PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "NO, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT. I DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT IT AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT IN CONVERSATION.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DECISION?
IT'S WHATEVER IS INTERESTING.
Stephen: I SHOW UP ON SUNDAY AND THEY HAND ME A SCRIPT.
IT'S A PROCESS. WE WORK OUT WHAT WE CAN DO. IF THE STORY FEELS LIKE IT STANDS UP AND IT FEELS LIKE WE CAN ADD SOMETHING TO IT, THEN WE'LL START. BUT THINGS FALL APART. SHOWS FALL APART. WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF DISASTER EVERY WEEK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THE TOBOGGAN CHAOS IS WHAT I CALL IT. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CORAL REEVES OR THE NEW ZEALAND FLAG DEBATE, OR AND I ASK BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL FAN SUGGESTIONS FROM THE HBO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT" WEB SITE. DO YOU TAKE THOSE SUGGESTIONS?
IF THAT'S SUGGESTING THE DESTRUCTION OF CORAL REEF, THAT IS PEOPLE WHO WANT OUR SHOW TO END. THAT IS A TROJAN HORSE SUGGESTION. DO CORAL REEFS AND WE NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOU AGAIN.
Stephen: BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO SAD?
WE DON'T TAKE SUGGESTIONS FROM PEOPLE.
Stephen: REALLY?
NO YOU.
Stephen:  HAVE A PLACE ON YOUR OFFICIAL WEB SITE FOR SUGGESTIONS.
I GENUINELY DID NOT KNOW WE HAD A WEB SITE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I HAD NO IDEA.
Stephen: WHAT IS IT? I'M SURE IF YOU GOOGLE LIKE "LAST WEEK TONIGHT" JOHN OLIVER HBO, I'M SURE IT WOULD TAKE TO YOU SOMETHING.
I CAN'T-- I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE WITH ME. I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT'S TRUE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HERE'S SOMETHING-- YOU DON'T INTERVIEW PEOPLE ON YOUR SHOW.
NO.
Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT BECAUSE YOU COME ON THESE OTHER SHOWS AND YOU GET ALL THE INTERVIEW JUICE, BUT YOU WON'T SPREAD IT AROUND OTHER PEOPLE. YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE A BLOC UP IN THE INTESTINE OF TALK SHOWS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP-- IT'S A DUODENAL, WE HAVE TO KEEP SQUEEZING THE TALK ON.
YOU HAVE VASTLY OVERESTIMATING THE VITAMIN VALUE OF MY JUICE. THIS IS-- THIS AIN'T-- THIS IS A LOW-END JUICE. THIS HAS GOT A LOT OF SHERBET IN IT.

Stephen: NO TEA? THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE DID.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY. BECAUSE WE'RE ON HALF AN HOUR A WEEK WE DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE ELECTION.
Stephen: THAT'S NICE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY ALL THE PERSONALITIES IN THE ELECTION ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES. YOU TALK ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS. WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT INSTEAD IN DID THE DEBATES.
ANYTHING THAT IS NOT ELECTION RELATED.

THERE ARE PLENTY OF PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAN THEMSELVES DISPLZ THOSE ARE SAD, THOUGH, JOHN, VERY SAD. MEANWHILE, HIS HAIR.

I JUST STUCK TO THE WATER.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH, YOU AND TOM HANKS. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, YOU ARE THE FOUNDER AND THE C.E.O. OF SNAPCHAT, WHICH 100 MILLION PEOPLE USE AND HAS RECENTLY BEEN VALUED AT $16 BILLION. AND YOU FOUNDED IT FOUR YEARS AGO. YOU WERE OFFERED $3 BILLION BY FACEBOOK TO BUY IT, AND YOU SAID NO. IF I COULD GET AN IMAX CAMERA OUT HERE, COULD I GET A PHOTO OF YOUR ( BLEEP )? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHY-- WHY DID YOU SAY NO? HOW BIG DO YOU WANT THIS THING TO BE? WHAT-- WHAT'S YOUR GOAL WITH SNAPCHAT?
OH, MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) IF I GO BACK TO WHEN BOBBY AND I WERE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT THIS AND MAKING THIS DECISION, I THINK WE JUST FELT THAT IT WAS REALLY, REALLY EARLY, AND THAT WE HAD SORT OF ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO BUILD AND PRODUCTS THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE, AND KIND OF THE STORY WASN'T OVER YET. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY FEEL THAT SORT OF THIS UNDERLYING CONCEPT THAT YOU SHOULD BUILD SOCIAL PRODUCTS REALLY FOR PEOPLE, AND THAT PEOPLE CHANGE. THEREFORE, YOUR PRODUCTS SHOULD CHANGE WITH THEM. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, EVERY DAY YOU'RE A NEW PERSON BECAUSE WE'VE ERASED YOUR STORY CONTENT WHICH ARE ALL YOUR STORIES AND VIDEO S.
Stephen:  DO YOU REALLY ERASE MY STORY CONTENT? DO YOU REALLY? I KNOW IT GOES OFF OF THE PERSON'S PHONE, BUT THERE'S NO SERVER SOME PLACE THAT HAVE PICTURES OF, LET'S SAY, NOT MY JUNK? ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT REALLY ERASED? IS IT REALLY GONE FOREVER?
YEAH, REALLY, TRULY, BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF A SNAP YOU LIKE OR SOMETHING SOMEBODY SENDS YOU.
Stephen: SO THERE WON'T BE A BUTTON THAT SNOWS UP ON SNAPCHAT THAT SAYS, "FOR $10, WE WILL REALLY ERASE IT THIS TIME."
IT WILL DEFINITELY BE MORE THAN $10.
Stephen: YOUR PRODUCT DOES CHANGE ALL THE TIME. THIS IS-- THIS IS A NEW THING. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS THING THAT I'M DOING RIGHT HERE BEFORE I SHOW IT TO ANYONE?
THAT IS RAINBOW VOMIT.
Stephen: OKAY. THIS-- THE SNAPCHAT MAPPED MY FACE, AND THERE'S A NAME FOR THIS LITTLE PRODUCT. CAN WE GET A SHOT OF THAT? THERE WE GO. IS THERE A NAME FOR THIS TOOL?
THAT'S A LENS.
Stephen: THIS LENS RIGHT HERE TOOK A PHOTO OF MY FACE, AND THEN INSERTED BIGGIZE, PINK CHEEKS, AND RAINBOW VOMIT. I DID IT HERE, BUT PEOPLE DID IT FOR EVERY CANDIDATE IN THE RECENT REPUBLICAN DEBATE. JIMMY, SHOW THEM WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING. CHECK OUT THESE. THERE IS CA MARCO RUBIO. THERE'S RAND PAUL WITH EXPLODING LOVE EYES. AND HERE'S CARLY FIORINA WITH AN EVIL MONOCLE IN HER EYE. AND WHAT INTERESTS ME-- THE REASON I REALLY WANTED TO SHOW THOSE IS BECAUSE 18- TO 24-YEAR-OLDS, MORE OF THEM WERE INVOLVED OR WATCHED THE DEBATE OR FOLLOWED THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE ON SNAPCHAT THAN CNN OR ON FOX NEWS WHEN THEY WERE BROADCAST THERE. IS THIS THE SNAPCHAT ELECTION?
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE SNAPCHAT ELECTION. PROBABLY THE PEOPLE-- IT'S DEFINITELY THE PEOPLE'S ELECTION. BUT THE THING THAT EXCITED US IS WE REALLY SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO, YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY HELP POLITICIANS REACH THEIR CONSTITUENTS, BUT REALLY TO HELP PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT POLITICS IN A WAY THAT GOES BEYOND JUST KNOWLEDGE, LIKE READING ABOUT IT OR EVEN JUST HEARING FROM A SINGULAR NEWSCASTER. WE HAD THIS LIVE STORY PRODUCT WHERE EVERYONE WHO IS AT AN EVENT CAN UPLOAD VIDEOS AS THEY EXPERIENCE THEM.
Stephen: THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY ATTENDING THE DEBATE.
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE.
Stephen: RUN INTO ONE OF THE CANDIDATES ON THE THE STREET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE EVENT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STORY. SO NO HASHTAGS REQUIRED. SO DURING THE EVENT YOU CAN WATCH ON SNAPCHAT AS IT UNFOLDS FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT SPECTATORS' POINTS OF VIEW.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, I CAN DO THAT WITH A VIRTUAL REALITY HELMET ON CNN. ( LAUGHTER ).
ACTUALLY-- NO IT'S INTERESTING YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE VIRTUAL REALITY IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT PUTS YOU IN ONE PLACE AND YOU CAN VIEW 360 DEGREES AROUND IT. FOR US IT'S ABOUT CAPTURING AS MANY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AS POSSIBLE. IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE 100 DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE. AND THAT FOR US --
AND ALL 100 OF THOSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE CAN ALL SEE FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THE IDIOT WITH THE GOGGLES ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM.
YEAH.

I STILL KIND OF STUTTER NOW. IF I GET UNDER PRESSURE IT COMES BACK. BUT, YEAH, I HAD-- YEAH. I HAD A BIRTH MARK ON MY EYE, AND THEY HAD TO GET LASERRED OFF BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT, AND THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE ANESTHETIC ON IT.
OH! >
I KNOW.
Stephen: THAT'S WHAT MADE YOU STUTTER?
YEAH. I WAS A VERY ODD CHILD. I HAD BIG, BIG, BLUE NATIONAL HEALTH GLASSES, GINGER HAIR, A STUTTER. I HADN'T GOT AN EARDRUM ON ONE SIDE SO I NEVER WENT SWIMMING.
Stephen:  YOU DON'T HAVE AN EARDRUM IN ONE YEAR? I DON'T HAVE AN EARDRUM IN THIS YEAR, EITHER.
MY WAY OF LOOKING AT IT IS THE REASON I BECAME A MUSICIAN IS GOD LOOKED DOWN AND SAID, "YOU PROBABLY NEED SOME HELP GETTING LAID." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HEY, I-- NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL GOING FROM GINGER TO A JIMPLEGGER SNAP.
