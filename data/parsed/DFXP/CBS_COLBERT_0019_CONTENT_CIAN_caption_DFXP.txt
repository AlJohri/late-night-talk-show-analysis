(  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  )  Captioning sponsored by CBS ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHOOO!
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU. THAT'S ENTIRELY NICE OF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE NAME YOU HAVE BEEN CHANTING UI AM STEPHEN COLBERT. I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD DAY. IT'S A BIT OF A DRIZZLY DAY HERE IN NEW YORK, WHERE THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS WRAPPING UP THEIR ANNUAL SESSION AND FREE PARKING FESTIVAL. IF YOU WILL WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THEY COMMITTED TO SOME REALLY NOBLE GOALS, ONE OF WHICH IS TO ERADICATE GLOBAL POVERTY BY THE YEAR 2030. IT'S SOMETHING I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE. BUT I WILL ADMIT, IT SOUND A LITTLE LESS NOBLE IF YOU IMAGINE IT COMING FROM A SUPER VILLAIN. "IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN, I SHALL RID THE WORLD OF ALL POOR PEOPLE! OH, YES! THERE WILL BE NO ONE HUNGRY WHEN I'M DONE! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!" ( APPLAUSE ) ALSO, WE HAVE A SHOW IN THIS THEATER THIS EVENING. I HOPE YOU'LL ENJOY TONIGHT'S OFFERINGS. FIRST, I'LL BE TALKING WITH OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR MORGAN FREEMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT SURPRISED. EVERYBODY LOVES MORGAN FREEMAN. ON THE SEASON PREMIERE OF "MADAM SECRETARY," HE'LL BE PLAYING A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, ASSUMING THE SENATE DOES NOT FILIBUSTER HIS AUDITION. ( LAUGHTER ) I'LL ALSO TALK WITH THE STAR OF SHOWTIME'S "THE AFFAIR," RUTH WILSON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT SURE IF YOU'RE APPLAUDING RUTH OR HAVING AN AFFAIR. IF YOU'RE PLANNING AN AFFAIR YOURSELF, BY THE WAY, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU ALSO DO IT ON PREMIUM CABLE, THAT MEANS THERE CAN BE NUDITY, WHICH HELPS WITH THE SEX. THEN I'LL TALK WITH SEAN MURRAY, DESIGNER OF THE VIDEO GAME "NO MAN'S SKY--" A COUPLE INSIDERS OUT THERE ENJOYING THAT. ANDS THIS TRUE, HAS OVER 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS TO EXPLORE. SO TO LITTLE BROTHERS EVERYWHERE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A BIT LONGER FOR YOUR TURN. OH, THAT IS THE SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( APPLAUSE ) BEFORE THESE GENTLEMEN DROP THE BEAT, ONE MORE THING, IN MAINE THIS WEEK A DOG HAD TO BE RESCUED AFTER DRIVING A PICKUP TRUCK INTO THE THE LAKE. THE DOG IS FINE, BUT IT REALLY HURT HIS UBER RATING. TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MORGAN FREEMAN. ACTOR RUTH WILSON. AND VIDEO GAME DESIGNER SEAN MURRAY. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU, JON.
YOU GOT IT. NOW, BEFORE WE GET STARTED TONIGHT, I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT HERE AT THE BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PRETENDING. THAT IS SOMETHING I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. I PRETENDED TO BE CERTAIN PERSON AND TO FEEL A CERTAIN WAY FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS, AND NOW I AM SUPPOSEDLY NOT PRETENDING EVERY NIGHT, THOUGH OCCASIONALLY I AM PRETENDING TO KNOW WHAT I AM DOING OUT HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW? RIGHT? YOU EVER GET THAT FEELING. PRETENDING HOW TO DO THIS SHOW. DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING SOMETIMES.
Jon: YEAH, WE HAVE NO IDEA.
Stephen: BUT YOU PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE AND YOU DO YOUR BEST, RIGHT?
Jon: THERE YOU GO. WE'RE DISCOVERING THE SHOW AS WE'RE GOING ALONG AND IT'S LIKE LEARNING TO PLAY A NEW INSTRUMENT IN PUBLIC. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT WHETHER OR NOT WE HIT THE RIGHT NOTES ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT, I THINK THAT THE LEAST I CAN DO IS NOT TO PRETEND TO ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND IN THE FACE OF THE KILLINGS IN OREGON YESTERDAY, I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OR SAY, OTHER THAN OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN FOR THE PEOPLE STRUCK BY THIS SENSELESS TRAGEDY. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO START A SHOW LIKE THIS WHICH IS OFTEN ABOUT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. I CAN'T PRETEND THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I ALSO CAN'T PRETEND TO KNOW WHAT TO DO TO PREVENT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY ALL THE TIMES IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. BUT I THINK PRETENDING IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. THESE THINGS HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND WE ARE NATURALLY HORRIFIED AND SHOCKED WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THEM BUT THEN WE CHANGE NOTHING AND PRETEND THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. SOME SAY THE ANSWER IS STRICTER GUN LAWS; OTHERS SAY THAT THE ANSWER IS MENTAL HEATH CARE, THAT WE NEED BETTER TREATMENT OR JUST KEEP THE GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE INSANE. MAYBE IT'S BOTH. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW. BUT I DO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE DEFINITIONING OF INSANITY IS CHANGING NOTHING AND PRETENDING SOMETHING WILL CHANGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SNEAKING-- SPEAKING OF HONEST INSANITY, DONALD TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I DO-- I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS-- I DO THINK HE IS HONEST IN HIS OWN WAY. HE IS HONESTLY AN EGOMANIACAL BILLIONAIRE. AND THIS WEEK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, TRUMP DEMONSTRATED HE WILL NOT TOLERATE DISHONESTY FROM HIS OPPONENTS, LIKE JEB BUSH AND MARCO RUBIO.
AND THEY ASK BUSH, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RUBIO?" RUBIO COMES OUT, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT BUSH, AND, YOU KNOW, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RUBIO?" "HE'S MY DEAR FRIEND. HE'S SO WONDERFUL. I LOVE HIM SO MUCH." THEN THEY ASK RUBIO, WHO'S RUNNING AGAINST BUSH OF COURSE AND HE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE FROM A LOYALTY STANDPOINT. SO THEY ASK RUBIO, "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BUSH?" "HE'S MY DEAR FRIEND. WONDERFUL, JUST WONDERFUL." THEY HATE EACH OTHER. THEY HATE. TRUST ME, I KNOW. THEY HATE SO MUCH. THEY HATE MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM HATES THEIR NEIGHBOR. ANY. BUT IT'S POLITICAL BULL-( BLEEP ). DO YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT IS TRUE, AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LOVE THIS GUY, BECAUSE, BECAUSE, HE UNDERSTANDS, HE KNOWS YOU HATE YOUR NEIGHBOR FOR BUILDING THAT GIANT TOWER THAT BLOCKS YOUR VIEW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHERE? WHERE-- OH, OH, OH, WHERE DID THE SUN GO? OH, MR. TRUMP, BRING THE SUN BACK. DONALD IS HONEST ENOUGH TO ADMIT WHAT WE ALL KNOW-- THE CANDIDATES CANNOT STAND EACH OTHER. JUST LOOK AT THE LAST REPUBLICAN DEBATE.
DO NOT GET IN MY FACE! ( BLEEP )! ( BLEEP )!
Stephen: WOW WOW, JAKE TAPPER REALLY LOST CONTROL OF THAT ONE. NOW, MR. TRUMP, TO ANSWER YOUR CALL FOR POLITICAL HONESTY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PRESIDENT. IT'S BEEN FUN. IT'S BEEN GREAT. I LOVE YOU! BUT COME ON, COME ON, BUDDY. ALL, LET'S SAY, COW POO POO ASIDE, THERE IS ZERO CHANCE WE WILL SEE YOU BEING SWORN IN ON THE CAPITOL STWEPS YOUR HAND ON A GIANT GOLDEN BIBLE. AND AND SPEAKING OF POLITICAL BULL ( BLEEP ). RIGHT NOW, THE BIG STORY FROM CAPITOL HILL IS NUMBER ONE ABOVE-GROUND POOL SALESMAN, KEVIN McCARTHY. HE'S A RISING STAR WHO IS SUCH A PLAYER THAT WHEN KEVIN SPACEY WAS PREPARING TO PLAY FRANK UNDERWOOD ON "HOUSE OF CARDS," HE SHADOWED McCARTHY ON THE HILL. SPACY WAS SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW HIM FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK BUT HE ENDED UP BINGE WATCHING McCARTHY ON A SUNDAY. WHEN SOMEBODY STARTED ASKING LAST WEEK WHO IS GOING TO REPLACE JOHN BOEHNER AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, McCARTHY SAID, "WHY NOT ME?" THEN IMMEDIATELY TOLD US WHY NOT.
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IS A CONSERVATIVE SPEAKER THAT TAKES A CONSERVATIVE CONGRESS THAT PUTS A STRATEGY TO FIGHT AND WIN. AND LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. EVERYBODY THOUGHT HILLARY CLINTON WAS UNBEATABLE, RIGHT? BUT WE PUT TOGETHER A BENGHAZI SPECIAL COMMITTEE, A SELECT COMMIT. WHAT ARE HER NUMBERS TODAY? HER NUMBERS ARE DROPPING.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S REFRESHING. AT LEAST HE'S NOT PRETENDING THAT HURTING HILLARY'S POLL NUMBERS WASN'T AT LEAST PART OF THE BENGHAZI'S COMMISSION. AND IT'S NICE TO SEE PART OF THAT COLD POLITICAL CALCULATION FROM SOMEWHERE RCH THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. BUT IN THE GAFFE-TERMATH OF THIS STATEMENT, REPUBLICANS ARE RIPPING INTO McCARTHY. CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND SEDUCTIVE BEAVER MASCOT JASON CHAFFETZ-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CALLED McCARTHY'S ADMISSION ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE AND SAID HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE. OR AT THE VERY LEAST, McCARTHY SHOULD TAKE A TIP FROM FRANK UNDERWOOD: THE NEXT TIME HE WANTS TO DIVULGE A DEVIOUS PLOT, DO IT IN A MONOLOGUE WHEN NO ONE IS AROUND. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I GOTTA SAY, I AGREE WITH McCARTHY'S CRITICS. IT WAS A MISTAKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE BENGHAZI INVESTIGATIONS WERE ALL ABOUT TAKING DOWN HILLARY CLINTON. UNFORTUNATELY, McCARTHY COMMITTED THE BIGGEST SIN IN POLITICS-- HONESTLY ADMITTING SOMETHING EVERYBODY WAS ALREADY SAYING. AND NOW THAT McCARTHY'S LITTLE WHITE TRUTH IS OUT THERE, IT CAN'T BE TAKEN BACK. SUDDENLY PEOPLE ARE ASKING WERE THE 10 CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSIONIES, THE 40,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS, THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT INVESTIGATING THESE TRAGIC DEATHS IN BENGHAZI PURELY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED? I'M NOT SURE. SO THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS WITH THE BENGHAZI HEARING HEARINGS. ( LAUGHTER ) OR-- NO, WAIT, MAYBE THESE INVESTIGATIONS OF WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN SAID NEED A NAME THAT DOESN'T FEEL SO POLITICAL. HOW ABOUT THE McCARTHY HEARINGS? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THAT HAS A RING OF HONESTY TO IT. STICK AROUND FOR MORGAN FREEMAN AND RUTH WILSON. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHOO! JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. IF YOU'RE IN NEW YORK, JON BATISTE AND THE BAND WILL BE PLAYING AT WEBSTER HALL TOMORROW NIGHT GO TO www.jonbatiste.com TO GET TICKETS. FOLKS, EVERY DAY, NEW TECHNOLOGY ARRIVES TO MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER, LIKE THE NEW GENERATION OF ROBOTS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO DO THE JOBS THAT SCARE US: FIGHTING FIRES; DEFUSING BOMBS; SPENDING TIME WITH THE ELDERLY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE ADVANCES IN ROBOTICS WITH OUR NEW SEGMENT: CYBORGASM. NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT HAPPENED THERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) TONIGHT'S CYBER CELEBRATION IS FOR A ROBOT WHO HAS PERFECTED YET ANOTHER HUMAN TASK WE DON'T WANT TO DO-- WALKING. THIS IS ATRIAS, A $4.7 MILLION BIPEDAL ROBOT DEVELOPED AT OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY WHOSE CARBON-FIBER LEGS LET HIM WALK EERILY LIKE A HUMAN. WHO HAS FOUR KNEES AND A MICROWAVE FOR A HEAD. AND, JUST LIKE A HUMAN, IT CAN WALK ANYWHERE IT WANTS WHERE THERE IS A MASSIVE SCAFFOLDING OPERATED BY A SMALL ARMY OF GRADUATE STUDENTS. TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. AFTER OUR CHRISTMAS PARTY, MY INTERNS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING TO GET ME TO THE LIMO. TRUE STORY. ITS CREATORS CLAIM THAT ATRIAS WAS DEVELOPED TO "TEST AND DEMONSTRATE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS FOR EFFICIENT AND AGILE LOCOMOTION." BUT IF THERE IS PURELY SCIENCE HERE, BUT HOW COME THE REST OF THIS VIDEO IS JUST THESE NERDS PELTING ATRIAS WITH DODGEBALLS? WHAT DID THE ROBOT DO, CLAIM "ATTACK OF THE CLONES" WAS BETTER THAN "RETURN OF THE JEDI"? NOW, AT FIRST, I THOUGHT MAYBE THESE SCIENTISTS WERE JUST TESTING THE ROBOT'S STABILITY, BUT THEN I SAW ANOTHER VIDEO THAT'S JUST THEM REPEATEDLY KICKING THE ROBOT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING! STOP! IT HAS NO MOUTH! IT CAN'T SAY THE SAFE WORD! I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. CLEARLY, THESE SCIENTISTS BUILT A CYBORG WEAKLING AS A PUNCHING BAG SO THEY COULD TAKE OUT YEARS OF PENT-UP NERD RAGE. AND AS A RESULT, ROBOTS WILL NOW HAVE JUST AS MANY ANGER ISSUES AS THE NERDS WHO BUILT THEM. AND WHEN THE ROBOT UPRISING COMES-- AND IT WILL COME, FOLKS-- ABUSIVE NERDS WILL BE THE FIRST UP AGAINST THE WALL. IRONICALLY, THE JOCKS WILL BE SPARED BECAUSE ROBOTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WELCOME IN THE N.F.L. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MR. MORGAN FREEMAN. STICK AROUND.
Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR, PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR. PLEASE WELCOME THE GREAT MORGAN FREEMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
NICE GROUP.
Stephen: YEAR, LOVELY GROUP. LOVELY GROUP. THEY ALL LOVE YOU, OBVIOUSLY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, WE'VE MET A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE, INTERVIEWED A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE. AND I GOTTA SAY ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKE ABOUT HAVING YOU ON THE SHOW IS YOU'RE JUST SO RELAXING TO BE AROUND. ( LAUGHTER ) IT JUST FEELS GOOD TO BE AROUND MORGAN FREEMAN. YOU KNOW. YOU'VE GOT, OBVIOUSLY, THAT RICH VOICE THAT EVERYBODY LOVES. YOU PLAYED GOD A BUNCH OF TIMES. ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN-- WHEN YOU ORDER PITA, DO THEY BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORGAN FREEMAN? OR DO THEY SAY, "KNOCK IT OFF."
ACTUALLY, THEY DO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: "THEY DO." EVERYBODY-- EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU FROM YOUR MOVIE CAREER. WHY ARE YOU DOING TV NOW? YOU'RE NOT ONLY A-- NOT ONLY PLAYED GOD, BUT YOU'RE A GOD OF THE MOVIES. YOU'RE A GIANT STAR. YOU'VE GOT AN OSCAR. WHY ARE YOU DOING TV NOW, MORGAN?
IT PAYS, TOO. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: "IT PAYS, TOO." YOU'RE THE--
ACTUALLY, WE WERE THINKING ABOUT JUST, YOU KNOW, BRANCHING OUT A LITTLE BIT.
Stephen: YEAH?
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF COMING UP ON TV, AND THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF OUTLETS, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: YEAH.
SO, WHY NOT?
Stephen: THEY EVEN GAVE ME A SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
YOU DESERVE IT, TOO.
Stephen: OH, WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU'RE NOT ONLY PERFORMING. YOU'RE ACTUALLY THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF "MADAM SECRETARY," AND THE SEASON PREMIERE IS THIS SUNDAY NIGHT, HERE ON CBS, OCTOBER 4. AND WHEN YOU STARTED THIS SHOW, YOU SAID YOU WERE NEVER GOING TO BE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA, BUT NOW YOU'RE PLAYING THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. WHAT DID YOU OFFER YOU TO GET YOU IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA? ( LAUGHTER ) OR DO YOU HAVE PICTURES ON YOU THAT YOU-- THAT YOU BLACKMAILED YOURSELF WITH? WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE FOR YOU?
IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU DO SOMETIMES. WE WERE HAVING AUDITIONS AND WE WERE SEEING ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. AND --
YOU WERE HAVING AUDITIONS AND YOU SAID, "I CAN DO A BETTER JOB THAN THESE PEOPLE!"
ACTUALLY, NOBODY ELSE AUDITIONED FOR THE PART. OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. I SAID, "OKAY, LISTEN, NOW WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE WHO SHOULD WE GET?" HMMM, WONDER IF WE COULD GET MORGAN. AND I SAID, "OKAY, I'LL AUDITION." AND I DID.
Stephen: AND DID THE DIRECTOR LIKE JEW HE DID. HE LIKED ME QUITE A LOT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: AND WHO IS DIRECTING THIS EPISODE?
ME. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: AND YOU GOT THIS JOB BYECT SLEEPING WITH THE DIRECTOR, EVIDENTLY?
YEAH. YEAH! ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YEAH.
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. ACTUALLY, I'M THINKING OF IT RIGHT NOW AND I WISH I WASN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) IS IT HARD, IS IT HARD TO DIRECT YOU? BECAUSE YOU MUST BE A LITTLE BIT OF A PRIMA DONNA TO YOURSELF, BECAUSE AS AN ACTOR, YOU HAVE AN OSCAR, BUT AS A DIRECTOR YOU DON'T. I IMAGINE YOU MIGHT THROW THAT IN YOUR OWN FACE EVERY SO OFTEN. ( LAUGHTER ) STARING IN THE MIRROR IN THE MORNING YOU SAY, "WHEN YOU GET ONE OF THESE, BUDDIES, YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT TO DO." BOOM! YEAH, NO?
IT'S AN IDEA.
Stephen: IT IS, IT IS.
I ACTUALLY NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY, BUT I SHOULD. IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO THE HOST OF A SHOW I LOVE "THROUGH THE WORM HOLE." YOU LOVE SCIENCE.
I DO-- HOLD ON.
Stephen: WHAT? WHAT DID I DO? DID I TOUCH A NERVE?
SCIENCE, I'M-- IT FASCINATES ME.
Stephen: I SAID YOU LIKE IT.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID LOVE. I'M SURE YOU USED THE WORD "LOVE." DID I HEAR LOVE? HAD DHE SAY LOVE?
Stephen: YOU DON'T LOVE SCIENCE?
NO. I'M SORRY. NO. I'M FASCINATED PIE --
WOW, THIS MUST BE HARD FOR SCIENCE TO HEAR RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH, BUT "THROUGH THE WORM HOLE" ISN'T SO MUCH SCIENCE. IT'S PHYSICS. THE PHYSICS OF COSMOLOGY. IT'S, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT.
Stephen: ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THE WATER ON MARS? ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT THAT?
I'M EXSTATIC.
Stephen: ME, TOO.
IF THERE'S WATER ON MARS, THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING, SOONER THAN WE MEANT TO GO.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'M SOR WORRIED ABOUT MATT DAMON, THOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WORRIED ABOUT HIM. I HOPE THEY GET THAT GUY BACK. I LIKE HIM. I LIKE HIM A LOT.
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WILL.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
ONE THING YOU CAN ALWAYS DEPEND ON. THIS IS ONE OF THE TRUTHS OF THE UNIVERSE, AND YOU HEARD IT FIRST FROM HERE-- WHATEVER WE DECIDE WE WANT TO DO, IS WHAT WE DO.
Stephen: WOW.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, HERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT. YOU'RE KNOWN FOR PLAYING ICONIC CHARACTERS IN A HOST OF MOVIES. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF CHARACTERS YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THAT I'M SURE WE WOULD ALL LIKE YOU TO HAVE PLAYED. AND IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WOULD LIKE TO YOU TAKE A SHOT. I KNOW YOU DON'T MIND AUDITIONING THESE DAYS. I'D LIKE YOU-- THERE ARE JUST A FEW OF THEM HERE. THESE ARE A COUPLE OF ICONIC PARTS I WOULDN'T MIND YOU TAKING A SHOT AT, GIVE IT THE MORGAN FREEMAN RUN, JUST MAYBE START HERE AND THEN GO ON THIS. WOULD YOU MIND TRYING THESE, ALL RIGHT? GIVE IT A SHOT, ONE OF THOSE. JUST LOOK RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA. LOOK RIGHT INTO THE CAMERA. RIGHT OVER HERE. RIGHT OVER HERE. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY. TRY THAT ONE RIGHT THERE.
IS THIS SOMEBODY WE KNOW. I'M JUST DOING SOMEBODY.
Stephen: THEY WILL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
DRAW ME LIKE ONE OF YOUR FRENCH GIRLS."
Stephen: YEAH. WOULDN'T HE BE GREAT?
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE --
TRY THIS ONE. TRY THIS ONE.
I AM GROUPED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT ONE.
OH, NO! IT'S CHRISTMAS! AND I'M A SMALL BOY WHO'S BEEN LEFT HOME ALONE! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: YOU GOT THE PART! MORGAN FREEMAN APPEARS ON THE SEASON PREMIERE OF "MADAM SECRETARY" THIS SUNDAY ON CBS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU, MORGAN.
Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS A GOLDEN GLOBE OLIVIER AWARD WINNER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, RUTH WILSON.
Stephen: YOU BOUNDED UP THOSE STEPS IN THOSE HIGH HEELS.
YEAH, I KNOW.
Stephen: NICELY DONE.
YEAH. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF HEELSES.
Stephen: I'M ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT WOMEN COMING UP THESE TWO STEPS. WAS IT OKAY?
IT WAS OKAY. YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO WALK-- LIKE, CHANGE YOUR BALANCE WITH HEELS. I WEAR FLAT SHOES ALL TIME. I'M A BIT OF A TOMBOY SO I HAVE TO PRACTICE WEARING HEELS.
Stephen: HOW IS IT GOING?
IT'S GOING WELL. SO FAR, I MIGHT HAVE TO BE CARRIED OFF.
Stephen: EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T DOING WELL, YOU COULD ACT LIKE YOU WERE DOING WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE A GREAT ACTRESS.
YES, THAT'S THE WHOLE THING. YOU PRETEND WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
Stephen: YOU'RE A GOLDEN GLOBE, TONY AWARD WINNING ACTOR, YOU WERE IN "SAVING MR. BANKS" "CONSTELLATIONS" ON BROADWAY, AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO START SEASON TWO OF "THE AFFAIR" ON SHOWTIME. EARLIER THIS WEEK, THEY SAID YOU WERE HAVING A MOMENT. HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I DON'T --
HOPEFULLY FOR ABOUT SEVEN MORE MINUTES AT LEAST.
YES. ( LAUGHTER ) MAYBE. SIX AND A HALF.
Stephen: LET'S TALK "THE AFFAIR" FOR A SECOND. I HAVE TO PUT ALL MY CARDS ON THE TABLE HERE. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO WATCH IT. ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY? BECAUSE I'M MARRIED.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND THE THEORY IS IF I WATCH "THE AFFAIR"--
YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE.
Stephen: I MIGHT WANT TO HAVE AN AFFAIR. WHILE I WATCHED "BREAKING BAD," I MADE A LOT OF METH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WILL I? WILL I WANT TO HAVE AN AFFAIR IF I WATCH "THE AFFAIR"?
THESE TWO DO IT SO BADLY I DON'T THINK YOU'D WANT AN AFFAIR.
Stephen: REALLY?
NO WAY, THEY'RE MISERABLE. I MEAN, THEY HAVE A LOT OF FUN IN THE FIRST SEASON, YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU REALIZE THIS SEASON IT'S JUST SUCH A BAD IDEA.
Stephen: THIS IS THE FALLOUT FROM THE AFFAIR?
THESE ARE MAJOR COANSQUENCES AND MISERY EVERYWHERE, CHAOS, DESTRUCTION. I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE TURNED ON BY IT. I DON'T THINK YOU'D REALLY WANT ONE AFTER THIS.
Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LITTLE LOOK AT "THE AFFAIR."
WHAT DO YOU DO UP HERE ALL DAY?
I READ. I WANDER ABOUT.
YOU LOOK HAPPY.
THE CHANGE IS NICE.
AND WHAT ABOUT HIM?
NOAH?
IS HE A GOOD GUY? IS HE GOOD TO YOU?
YEAH. HE IS.
Stephen: YOU SEEMED LIKE A PERFECTLY NICE PERSON IN THAT
SHE'S HAVING A GREAT TIME. THAT'S FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW, FROM COLE'S POINT OF VIEW. LAST SEASON IT WAS JUST TWO PERSPECTIVES. IT WAS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND THE GUY I'M HAVING THE AFFAIR WITH.
Stephen: NOAH.
NOAH. AND THIS SEASON WE GO TO THE SPOUSES AS WELL.
Stephen: SO THE GUY YOU LEFT.
YES, THAT'S THE GUY I LEFT.
Stephen: HE LOOK REALLY SAD.
Stephen: HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD DUDE, TOO.
REALLY GOOD, AND I RUINED HIS LIFE.
Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY WHAT THE TRUTH OF THE STORY IS BECAUSE YOU KEEP ON SEEING THE SCENES OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I UNDERSTAND, FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S POINTS OF VIEW. DO YOU THINK YOUR CHARACTER IS RIGHT?
ALWAYS.
Stephen: DO YOU-- BECAUSE THAT-- BECAUSE WE CAN FOOL OURSELVES A LOT IN OUR LIVES, CAN'T WE?
YEAH. THE WHOLE IDEA IS THAT THESE CHARACTERS ARE ALSO TELLING THEIR OWN STORY-- THEY WANT TO PUT THEIR BEST SIDE STORY TELLING-- IN THE FIRST SERIES TELLING A DETECTIVE, SO THEY HAD TO PUT THEIR BEST VERSION OF THEMSELVES FORWARD. SO IT'S SLIGHTLY ALSO SKEWED. THEY CAN BE QUITE MANIPULATIVE, THESE VERSIONS OF THE TRUTH, AS WELL
Stephen: DO YOU FIND YOURSELF LYING TO YOURSELF ABOUT YOURSELF. BECAUSE I DO IT ALL THE TIME. I HAVE TO REMIND ESPECIALLY, ESPECIALLY IF I HAVE DONE SOMETHING I'M KIND OF ASHAMED OF, I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF I UPON THE ONE WHO DID THAT. OR I HAVE TO REWRITE THE STORY THAT I AM EITHER THE HERO OR THE VICTIM OF THE STORY.
THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS THE HERO, SO EVERYONE ELSE IS THE BADDIE. HE'S THE BADDIE. IN MY VERSION I'M THE VICTIM. I'M ABUSED AND HURT AND PEOPLE HATE ME AND I HAVEN'T GOT MANY FRIENDS AND THEN-- BUT SO --
PEOPLE'S WIVES DON'T LET THEM WATCH YOUR SHOW.
NO. ARE YOU SAD ABOUT THAT? DO YOU WANT TO BE WATCHING IT?
Stephen: NOW THAT I'VE MET YOU, I WANT TO WATCH IT.
I THINK YOU SHOULD. I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU'D HAVE AN AFFAIR AFTER WATCHING THIS. I THINK IT'S A MAJOR DETERRENT.
Stephen: REALLY? IT'S A PROPHYLACTIC FOR AFFAIRS.
YES. THE ASHLEY MADISON PEOPLE SHOULD BE WATCHING IT.
Stephen: I THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE HIDING SOMEPLACE RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION WHEN YOU WERE DOING THE SHOW IS BECAUSE YOU SAID-- YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING TO ME WHICH I THINK IS RIGHT. YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T DO THE SHOW IF ONLY WOMEN WERE SHOWN THEIR FACE WHILE THEY WERE HAVING ORGASMS BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT'S UNFAIR THAT MEN DON'T HAVE THEIR FACE SHOWN HAD THEY HAVE ORGASMS ON TV SHOWS.
WE HOPE THAT MEN AND WOMEN-- EVERYONE HAS ORGASMS, RIGHT? WELL, HOPEFULLY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: NOT ON CBS, MY FRIEND. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >
AND THIS IS GOING TO HOLD ME. MY PARENT ARE SO HAPPY THAT THIS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ME. THE ORGASM FACE. ANYWAY, BUT, YES, THE IDEA-- WELL, FOR ME, I FELT IN THE FIRST SEASON, THAT THERE WAS AN EMPHASIS ON ME HAVING TO DO THE FINAL DEED.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
OR SHOW THE FINAL DEED.
Stephen: THE DEMONSTRATIVE OF THE PLEASURE OF THE MOMENT. BE THE FACE OF THE DEED AT THE END. AND I KIND OF WAS GETTING A BIT BORED OF THAT AND I WANTED DOMINIC TO HAVE EQUAL TIME ON SCREEN.
Stephen: THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE. THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.
IT'S A SHARED ENJOYMENT MOMENT AND HE SHOULD HAVE AS MUCH TIME SHOWING THAT AS I DO.
Stephen: I HAVE AN IDEA. I HAVE AN IDEA, IF YOU'LL GO ALONG WITH ME ON THIS. CAN I SHOW AN ORGASM FACE ON CBS? I KNOW THIS IS AS A RULE, I CANNOT DO THIS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER FACES THAT LOOK JUST LIKE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OKAY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO THE NETWORK CENSORS THESE ARE NOT ORGASM FACES. THEY ARE NOT.
NO.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO SAY WHAT THEY ARE. I'LL DO ONE FIRST. I'LL DO IT. BECAUSE IT'S MEN AND WOMEN. I'LL DO ONE FIRST, AND THEN I'LL DO THE FACE. OKAY? THIS IS WHEN YOU FIND $20 YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAVE IN YOUR POCKET. A LITTLE CLOSER. I THINK A LITTLE CLOSER FOR THIS. RIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? READY? TELL THEM WHAT IT IS BEFORE YOU DO IT.
OKAY, THIS IS-- ALL RIGHT, THAT FEELING RIGHT BEFORE YOU SNEEZE. AH!
Stephen: NICE, OKAY. ( APPLAUSE ) I'M GOING TO DO THIS ONE, OKAY? I'M GOING TO DO THIS ONE. WHEN YOU WANT TO CANCEL PLANS WITH A FRIEND BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL THEM BUT THEN YOU GET A TEXT FROM YOUR FRIEND SAYING THEY HAVE TO CANCEL FIRST. OKAY. OH, YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OKAY. WHEN YOU FINALLY GET THAT JAR OF PASTA SAUCE OPEN. OKAY. LET'S DO THE ACTION WITH THIS. ( GRUNTING ) AH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, "THE AFFAIR," SEASON TWO, PREMIERES THIS SUNDAY ON SHOWTIME. RUTH WILSON, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CREATOR OF THE HUGELY ANTICIPATED VIDEO GAME, "NO MAN'S SKY." HERE WITH A SNEAK PEEK, PLEASE WELCOME SEAN MURRAY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ALL KIND OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK EXCITED THAT I'VE GOT YOU ON HERE TONIGHT. THE GAME IS "NO MAN'S SKY." IT'S ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED VIDEO GAMES THAT HAVE COME OUT IN YEARS. GAMING WORLD HAS BEEN DYING TO KNOW THE RELEASE DATE. I'M GUESSING IT'S FAIRLY SOON SINCE YOU'RE ON MY SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) CAN YOU GIVE US ANY IDEA WHEN THAT MIGHT BE OR IS IT STILL A SECRET?
IT'S STILL A SECRET, I'M AFRAID.
Stephen: OKAY, GREAT. LET'S TALK.  THING EVERYONE WANTS YOU TO RELEASE, "NO MAN'S SKY." WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT IT? IT'S A SPACE GAME, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS GAME THAT MAKES IT LIKE QUANTUM LEAP FROM EARLIER GAMING PLATFORMS?
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE AN ENTIRE UNIVERSE GENERATED BY THE COMPUTER AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SET PEOPLE LOOSE IN IT.
Stephen: BY "ENTIRE UNIVERSE" DO YOU MEAN SOMETHING THE SIZE OF THE UNIVERSE?
EXACTLY, YEAH. SO, LIKE, 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS.
Stephen: 18 QUINTILLION PLANETS. THAT'S A HARD NUMBER TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND. ARE YOU WORRIED THE GAME MIGHT GET BORING AFTER VISITING THE FIRST TRILLION PLANETS. YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY PLAY THE ENTIRE GAME THEN.
NO, RIGHT, BY THE TIME-- LIKE, EVEN IF A PLANET WAS DISCOVERED EVERY SECOND, YOU KNOW, WE-- WE WOULD STILL ALL BE DEAD BEFORE THEY WERE ALL DISCOVERED. OUR SUN WOULD HAVE BURNED OUT, OUR OWN SUN.
Stephen: OUR ACTUAL SUN. NOT IN THE THE SUN IN THE GAME.
NOT THE SUN IN THE GAME.
Stephen: HOW DO YOU CREATE THIS? MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU DIDN'T CREATE THE ACTUAL PLANETS. THE UNIVERSE ITSELF CREATED THE PLANETS ITSELF. HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT?
WE ARE A TINY TEAM. GAMES ARE NORMALLY MADE BY HUGE TEAMS, HUNDREDS OF US, AND THERE ARE BASICALLY 10 OF US MAKING THIS GAME SO WE USE THE COMPUTER TO GENERATE EVERYTHING YOU SEE USING MATH, BASICALLY.
Stephen: YOU USE MATH.
YES.
Stephen: USING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AS THEY'RE GENERALLY SEND NOW?
YEAH, THAT'S PART OF IT, YEAH.
Stephen: AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, BECAUSE THESE PLANETS ARE POPULATED?
WE'VE GOT CREATURES, TREES, ROCKS, GRASS --
AND YOU ONE OF THE CREATORS OF THE GAME GO TO ONE OF THE PLANETS AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT YOU WILL RUN INTO BECAUSE IT JUST GREW THERE.
RIGHT. WE WERE CONSTANTLY SURPRISED. WE'LL FIND CREATURES WE NEVER KNEW EXISTED. WE FIND LIFE IN PLACES WE NEVER EXPECTED IT.
Stephen: I THOUGHT MORGAN FREEMAN WAS GOD. YOU ARE ACTUALLY MY SECOND GOD I'M HAVING ON THE SHOW. LET'S GIVE THE PEOPLE OUT THERE AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU CAN RUN INTO WHEN YOU FINALLY GET TO PLAY THIS THING, AND THE SCALE OF THE THING THAT YOU HAVE SET IN MOTION. I WON'T SAY CREATED, BUT SET IN MOTION TO CREATE ITSELF.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU SET THE PARAMETERS FOR WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE. WE HAVE THE THE THINGS UP ON THE SCREENS HERE. WE'RE PLAYING IT RIGHT OVER HERE. SO WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW?
SO WE'RE IN A SOLAR SYSTEM AT THE OUTSIDE EDGE OF SPACE.
Stephen: OKAY, WE'RE LANDING--
AS YOU CAN SEE, SPACE IS FULL.
Stephen: YOU COULD HAVE GONE AROUND THAT. YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE GONE AROUND THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
I'VE GOT A CROWD TO PLEASE.
Stephen: SO WE'RE ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE?
SO WE'RE GOING TO HEAD DOWN TO THIS PLANET AND TAKE A LOOK.
Stephen: WE'RE COMING IN PRET HOT, SEAN. BE CAREFUL. IS THERE, LIKE, AN ABLATIVE QUALITY? ARE WE GOING TO HEAT IEWP YES, WE ARE. WE'RE HEATING UP AS WE COME IN. WE'RE ON NADARE, ISK, ATMOSPHERE 12% OXYGEN.
IT'S NOT OXYGEN. IT'S OKCYCIN.
Stephen: BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU LAND.
YOU CAN GET OUT WHEREVER YOU WANT.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN ADVENTURURE AND DISCOVERER.
AN EXPLORER.
Stephen: THAT'S THE OBJECTION OF THE GAME?
IT'S A SCIENCE FICTION NAME.
Stephen: AND YOU'RE VERY MAD AT GREEN PYLONS UNDER SOME REASON. WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING THE PYLONS?
WE'RE COLLECTING SOME RESOURCES, CHEMICAL ELEMENTS.
Stephen: YOU CAN USE THAT FOR FUEL?
EXACTLY.
Stephen: THOSE ANIMALS, YOU DIDN'T CREATE THEM. THEY GREW BASED UPON THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AND THE CONDITIONS OF THE PLANET.
THE RULES WE'VE SET IN MOTION, THE RULES WE'VE TAUGHT THE COMPUTER. UP IN THE SKY YOU CAN SEE OTHER PLANETS. AND JUST FOR THE SHOW I'VE ADDED A BUTTON SO WE COULD JUST JUMP THERE. NORMALLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO FLY WHICH TAKES TIME.
Stephen: IS THERE A HYPERJUMP IN THIS?
YES. BUT I JUST WANTED TO TAKE YOU AROUND THIS SOLAR SYSTEM, JUST ONE SOLAR SYSTEM. A BIG PART OF GAME IS THAT YOU CAN NAME THINGS IF YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON TO DISCOVER THEM. YOU CAN KIND OF SET YOUR MARK ON THE WORLD. SO I THOUGHT WE'D ALLOW YOU TO JUST PUT YOUR NAME ON SOMETHING.
Stephen: MINE! THE COLBISON, THAT'S NICE. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S CALLED LOYT.
Jon: MINE!
Stephen: THE MOLBERT. DO YOU GET POINTS FOR NAPING THINGS?
YEAH, YOU GET MONEY FOR THAT. YOU'RE BASICALLY AN EXPLORER. EVERYONE IS EXPLORING TOGETHER THE SAME UNIVERSE. AND SO IF SOMEBODY ELSE COMES AND VISITS THAT PLANET, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE MULBEAR.
Stephen: DINOSAURS, KANGAROOS, OBVIOUSLY, WITHANTLERS. MINE! NICE. I SAW ONE OF THOSE ROBOTS CALLED ATRIAS EARLIER IN ONE THE SHOW. HURRICANE WAW TEEN IS OFF THE COAST OF FLETTIA, OBVIOUSLY.
THAT'S IT. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ECOLOGIES, THEIR OWN WEATHER SYSTEMS.
Stephen: HOW BIG-- CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW? SO THESE-- MINE! WE'RE ON OUR FOURTH PLANET NOW. RIGHT?
YEAH, THIS IS THE FIFTH.
Stephen: FIFTH PLANET, ALL IN THE SAME STAR SYSTEM.
ALL IN THE SAME STAR SYSTEM.
Stephen: DO WE EVER GET TO SEE OURSELVES?
NO, YOU DON'T SEE YOURSELF. SO ONLY WAY FOR TO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE IS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO, YOU KNOW, SEE YOU.
Stephen: YOU CAN RUN INTO OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER PLAYERS ON THE GAME?
YES, BUT THE CHANCES OF THAT ARE INCREDIBLY RARE JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF WHAT WE'RE BUILDING.
Stephen: WOW. MINE! ( LAUGHTER ) HOW-- HOW DO YOU-- HOW DO YOU HOST PEOPLE-- WHERE DO YOU HOST SOMETHING THIS BIG THAT YOU HAVE 18 QUINTILLION STARS?
ACTUALLY, BECAUSE IT'S ALL GENERATED FROM MATH, EVERYTHING IS JUST GENERATED. THERE'S NOTHING STORED ON DISK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS WHOLE PLANET --
THAT'S PLANET WE WERE JUST ON.
THAT YOU NOW OWN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S NOT BAD. NOT BAD.
IT'S JUST BEING GENERATED RIGHT NOW AS I WALK AROUND IT. SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO LOAD TIMES. EVERYTHING YOU SEE JUST HAPPENS ON FLY.
Stephen: WOW.
GENERATED BY THE COMPUTER SO WE'RE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED, THAT FIRST PLANET WE LANDED ON. AND I CAN JUST HOP IN MY SHIP AND FLY BACK OUT TO SPACE.
Stephen: THAT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE AN X-WING FIGHTER. LET'S GO TO SPACE BEFORE THE LAWYERS FROM LUCUS FILMS CATCH US?
THEY WILL BLAME OUR COMPUTER-GENERATED ALGORITHM. THEY DON'T KNOW.
Stephen: WE GET A VIEW OF THE STAR SYSTEM UP HERE?
RIGHT. SO I CAN POP OUT TO THE GALACTIC MAP.
Stephen: LET'S DO THAT.
THIS IS THE STAR SYSTEM WE'RE AT ARENCOR. WHERE THE PLANETS WERE ORBITING AROUND WAS THE SUN. AND WE CAN NAME THAT.
Stephen: MINE! I LIKE IT, I LIKE IT.
IF I COULD PULL OUT A LITTLE BIT, YOU'LL BEGIN TO GET A SENSE OF --
OH, THAT'S THE LOCAL GROUP?
RIGHT. YOU GET A SENSE OF THE SCALE WE'RE BUILDING.
Stephen: AND EACH ONE OF THOSE DOTS--
IS A STAR SYSTEM.
Stephen: THAT YOU CAN VISIT.
JUST LIKE THE ONE WE WERE AT WITH PLANET-SIZED PLANETS AND LIFE AND ECOLOGY AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
Stephen: IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT. AND-- AND AWE-INSPIRING LIKE A NIGHT SKY. TO KNOW THE VASTNESS AND CAPABILITY OF IT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WELL, SEAN, GOOD LUCK. I CAN'T WAIT TO ACTUALLY PLAY IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
THANKS SO MUCH.
Stephen: SEAN MURRAY WILL DEMO "NO MAN'S SKY" THIS SATURDAY AT THE NEW YORKER FESTIVAL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY. TUNE IN MONDAY WHEN MY GUEST WILL BE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, AND BALLERINA MISTY COPELAND, WITH A SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY YO-YO MA. NOW STICK AROUND FOR JAMES CORDON. GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by  Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
