THE COMEDY LANDSCAPE IS SO THICKLY PLANTED WITH THE FOREST OF DAVE'S IDEAS THAT WE SOMETIMES NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES JUST HOW TALL HE STANDS. SO JUST FOR THE RECORD, I'M NOT REPLACING DAVID LETTERMAN. HIS CREATIVE LEGACY IS A HIGH PENCIL MARK ON A DOOR FRAME THAT WE ALL HAVE TO MEASURE OURSELVES AGAINST.

THAT'S MY WIFE AND KIDS, AND IN FRONT OF THEM, THAT GUY IN THE GREEN SHIRT RIGHT THERE, THAT'S MY BROTHER JAY. >> YOUNGER BROTHER. >> Stephen: THAT'S MY BROTHER JAY. AND, JAY, YOU AND I DON'T AGREE POLITICALLY, DO WE? AND I LOVE YOU. >> I LOVE YOU, TOO. >> Stephen: ANOTHER SO WITHOUT-- >> DOES JAY LIVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. >> Stephen: JAY TEACHES SOUTH CAROLINA HISTORY. >> I WANT YOUR VOTE IN THE PRIMARY. >> Stephen: GOOD, GOOD. NO, YOU GOTTA GO FOR IT, ANYWHERE YOU CAN GET THEM. NOW, I LOVE MY BROTHER EVEN THOUGH WE POLITICALLY DIFFER. WITHOUT IN ANY WAY DIMINISHING YOUR LOVE FROM YOUR BROTHER, IN WHAT WAYS DO YOU POLITICALLY DIFFER FROM YOUR BROTHER GEORGE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> I'M, OBVIOUSLY, YOUNGER. >> Stephen: YOU'RE YOUNGER. >> MUCH BETTER LOOKING. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. POLICY, THOUGH. YOU CAN TELL US ANY POLICY. >> OH, OH! >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY POLICY DIFFERENCES? >> I THINK MY BROTHER DIDN'T CONTROL THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS SPENDING. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE HAMMER DOWN ON THE GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY WERE SPENDING WAY TOO MUCH. OUR BRAND IS LIMITED GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE IN THE FRONT OF THE LINE, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING. THAT'S A CORE VALUE OF OUR PARTY, BUT WE SHOULDN'T SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THAT'S THE LAST THING WE WERE DOING IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF MY BROTHER'S 10URE. HE DIDN'T BRING ORDER AND FISCAL RESTRAINT. >> Stephen: THE WAY YOU DIFFER FROM YOUR BROTHER, GEORGE, IS HE WAS NOT CONSERVATIVE ENOUGH? >> ON SPENDING. THEY CALL ME VETO CORLEONE IN FLORIDA. I VETE -- >> YOU KNOW, HE IS AN ANTIHERO IN THAT MOVIE. WELL, GOVERNOR BUSH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING MY FIRST CANDIDATE TO COME ON THE SHOW. I'M REALLY HONORED THAT YOU WOULD BE HERE. >> THANK YOU, STEPHEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> Stephen: GOVERNOR JEB BUSH. COULD BE PRESIDENT. WE DON'T KNOW. GOOD LUCK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
