>> Jon: STEPHEN COLBERT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING INTRO MUSIC  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) >> Stephen: HEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW,"" EVERYBODY! THANKS SO MUCH. HEY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M SO HAPPY YOU GUYS ARE HERE. EVERYBODY FEELING GOOD TONIGHT? ME, TOO. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. HAPPY TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, I'M A MODERN MAN, BUT I'M A FAN OF TRADITION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EACH COUNTRY TO HOLD ONTO ITS CULTURAL UNIQUENESS. BUT I JUST LEARNED THAT ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT TRADITIONS IS AT RISK. SPANISH PRIME MINISTER MARIANO RAJOY WANTS TO REDUCE SPAIN'S THREE-HOUR SIESTA TO ONE HOUR >> Audience: BOO! >> Stephen: YES. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT IN SPANISH, BUT YES. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE A LUNCH BREAK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. SPANISH WORKERS WOULD END THEIR DAY AT 6:00 P.M. INSTEAD OF GOING HOME FOR THEIR NAP, THEY'D SLEEP AT THEIR DESK LIKE THE REST OF US. WELL, I'M HERE TO SAY, SPAIN, NO ES BUENO. DON'T DO IT. YOU DON'T REALIZE IT, BUT YOU'RE THREATENING AN AMERICAN TRADITION OF MAKING FUN OF SPAIN FOR BEING A LAZY COUNTRY WHERE NOTHING GETS DONE. THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US. TO US, SPAIN IS A FANCIFUL WONDERLAND WHERE EVERYONE SLEEPS ALL AFTERNOON AND DINNER IS ACTUALLY 100 LITTLE DINNERS ON TINY PLATES. YOU ORDER TOO MUCH AND STILL ARE HUNGRY. WHEN WE TRAVEL TO SPAIN, WE WANT THE CONVENIENCE OF NOTHING BEING OPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. "I'D LIKE TO CASH A CHECK, PLEASE." "I'M SORRY, SENOR, THE MONEY IS SLEEPING." BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE PLANNING A TRIP TO SPAIN THIS SUMMER, IF YOU'RE DOING SOME TRAVELING, PLEASE BE KIND TO OUR FRIENDS IN THE T.S.A. THEY'VE GOT A HARD JOB TO DO AND PROVIDE A CRUCIAL SERVICE. BEFORE THE T.S.A., THE ONLY PLACE SOMEONE WOULD BRUSH THEIR KNUCKLES ACROSS MY JUNK WAS EVERY SUBWAY CAR IN NEW YORK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AM I SUPPOSED TO TIP YOU? I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE TRADITION IS HERE. AND SOME INTERESTING NEWS WAS JUST REVEALED ABOUT T.S.A. TECHNOLOGY. AT SOME CHECKPOINTS, PASSENGERS ARE SELECTED FOR SCREENING BY ONE OF THE T.S.A. FOLKS TAPPING AN iPAD LIKE THIS WHICH RANDOMLY GENERATES AN ARROW THAT TELLS PASSENGERS TO GO IN THE LEFT LINE OR THE RIGHT LINE. LEFT OR RIGHT. WELL, IT WAS REVEALED YESTERDAY THAT THAT APP COST $1.4 MILLON, YES, AND, NATURALLY PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT THAT. SO RIGHT NOW I WANT TO HELP BY OFFERING THE T.S.A. AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT WITH ME TO SUPPLY A MUCH CHEAPER, ADVANCED RANDOM BINARY CHOICE GENERATOR, THE FLIPOMATIC 5400. I HAVE ONE WITH ME RIGHT NOW. T.S.A., THE FLIPO MEATIC COULD BE YOURS FOR THE LOW, LOW, PRICE OF $1.3 MILLION THE FLIPOMATIC COMES PRE-PROGRAMMED TO HAVE TWO SIDES, ONLY ONE OF WHICH CAN BE UP AT A TIME. THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY IN USE BY THE N.F.L. THEY ARE HIGHLY PORTABLE, DURABLE, AND THERE ARE 50 DIFFERENT DESIGNS, ONE FOR EACH STATE THE T.S.A. OPERATES IN. AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION. AND THEY ARE DUAL USE. IN ADDITION TO RANDOMLY COMPUTING LEFT OR RIGHT, YOU CAN ALSO USE THEM ON SCRATCH OFF LOTTERY TICKETS, WHICH YOU MIGHT NEED GIVEN HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'VE BLOWN ON THAT APP. LET'S TRY IT OUT. TONIGHT WE HAVE... OH, A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WASN'T SURE. WE DON'T KNOW. THAT'S THE FLIPOMATIC TALKING. FROM THE MOVIE "THE BOSS" WE'VE GOT BEN FALCONE AND MELISSA McCARTHY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN I'LL BE JOINED BY WEB NEWS HIGH PRIESTESS, ARIANNA HUFFINGTON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY BABY METAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BABY METAL, BABY. >THAT THERE IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI TO THE BAND, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO DROP IT LIKE IT'S HOT, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: THIS SEASON THE NEW YORK YANKEES PAYROLL IS $222 MILLION. OR AS IT'S KNOWN AT YANKEE STADIUM, A HOT DOG AND A BEER. >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MELISSA McCARTHY AND BEN FALCONE. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY BABY METAL. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> Jon: BOOM! BAM! >> Stephen: THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOOM, BAM. DID YOU ALL CATCH THE N.C.A.A. CHAMPIONSHIP LAST NIGHT? DID YOU WATCH IT, JON. >> Jon: I CAUGHT THE END OF IT. >> Stephen: YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE TO WATCH THE LAST FIVE SECONDING OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP. >> Jon: I CAUGHT, LIKE, THE LAST MINUTE OF THE GAME. >> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH THE BEGINNING OF IT? YOU DONT LIKE BASKETBALL THAT MUCH? >> Jon: I JUST SAW THE NEWS AND HEARD ABOUT THE SHOT AND I CHECKED IT OUT ON YOUTUBE. >> Stephen: TECHNICALLY, THAT'S NOT WATCHING THE GAME. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Jon: I DID WATCH IT. >> Stephen: THAT'S GOING TO YOUTUBE. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "I READ ABOUT THE HINDENBURG SO I WENT AND WATCHED THE FILM." YOU DIDN'T WATCH THE GAME. YOU WATCHED YOUTUBE, THEN. >> Jon: TECHNICALLY SPEAK I WATCHED THE GAME ON YOUTUBE. U. >> Stephen: AFTER THE GAME WAS OVER TO SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD WATCHED THE GAME. >> Jon: EXACTLY. IT WAS LIKE A SIMULATION. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SEE -- >> NO, I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND. BUT YOU WILL AGREE, IT WAS EXCITING, RIGHT. IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING END OF GAMES TO HEAR ABOUT AND THEN GO WATCH. >> Jon: IT WAS KILLING. >> Stephen: IT WAS AMAZING. >> Jon: IT WAS BLOWING UP MY TWITTER FEED AND I WAS LIKE, MAN, I GOTTA CHECK THESE SHOTS OUT. SO I WATCHED IT, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE SHOTS WERE COMING SO IT WAS STILL BRAND NEW TO ME. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S VERY EFFICIENT. THAT'S VERY EFFICIENT. THE GAME WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS BANANAS IS WHAT THE GAME WAS. IT WAS B-A-N-N-A-N-N-A-S, BANANAS. VILLANOVA'S KRIS JENKINS HITS AN ICE-COLD BUZZER-BEATER TO WIN IT ALL. BUT FOR ME, THE REAL HIGHLIGHT CAME BETWEEN THE TWO BIG SHOTS WHEN, WITH THE GAME TIED AND HIS TEAM REELING,  VILLANOVA CENTER DANIEL OCHEFU TOOK THE TIME TO PERSONALLY MOP THE FLOOR. THAT'S EXCITING. THAT'S EXCITING BASKETBALL. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW GAME FOR XBOX, "N.C.A.A. MOP MADNESS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I GOT SWIFFER TO WIN MY WHOLE BRACKET. I DON'T WANT TO BRAG, BUT I'VE BEEN A GIANT VILLANOVA FAN MY ENTIRE... SINCE A WEEK AGO. JON, YOU'RE A BASKETBALL GUY. >> Jon: RIGHT. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU BEEN FOLLOWING MARCH MADNESS? >> Jon: I LIKE DUKE WHEN I WATCH BASKETBALL. >> Stephen: I'M PULLING FOR VILLANOVA RIGHT NOW. ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: YEAH. VILLANOVA. I PICKED ONE OF FOUR TEAMS. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? YOU HAVE NO WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. ANYWAY, CONGRATULATIONS VILLANOVA. THAT'S CALLED THE COLBERT BUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OF COURSE, ONE OF THE REASONS I ROOTED FOR VILLANOVA IS BECAUSE THEY'RE A CATHOLIC SCHOOL, AND IF YOU'RE A REGULAR VIEWER, YOU KNOW THAT I'M A CATHOLIC. AND IF YOU'RE NOT A REGULAR VIEWER, DON'T WORRY. AS A CATHOLIC, I'M THE ONE WHO FEELS GUILTY ABOUT IT. ( LAUGHTER ) UNFORTUNATELY, I'M OFTEN TOO BUSY FOR MY FAVORITE CATHOLIC TRADITIONS-- THE ROSARY, STATIONS OF THE CROSS, FINDING HIDDEN MESSAGES FROM LEONARDO DAVINCI IN RENNAISSANCE ARTS. BUT THE TRADITION I MISS MOST IS CONFESSION. SO I WAS WONDERING IF RIGHT NOW, I COULD EXAMINE MY CONSCIENCE RIGHT NOW WITH YOU, THE AUDIENCE. YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY, RIGHT? >> Audience: OF COURSE NOT! >> Stephen: GOOD. THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT'S MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS. ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, FOR THE RECORD, I'M NOT SURE IF THESE ARE TECHNICALLY SINS, BUT I DO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEM. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( LAUGHTER ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE. BEFORE I PUT CASH IN A TIP JAR, I ALWAYS WAIT UNTIL THE EMPLOYEES CAN SEE ME DO IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, SOMETIMES I GO ON REAL ESTATE WEBSITES AND SEE HOW BIG A HOUSE I COULD BUY IN MISSOURI. ( APPLAUSE ) I TAKE HOTEL SHAMPOO BOTTLES WHEN I'M NOT STAYING AT THE HOTEL. ( APPLAUSE ) YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY, I TOLD A COWORKER SHE HAD THE CUTEST BABY. BUT REALLY IT WAS MORE OF A SIX. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE TIME IN A STORE, I USED THE EMPLOYEES-ONLY BATHROOM BY TELLING THEM I WAS A REGIONAL MANAGER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SOMETIMES I'M SO LAZY, I USE MACHINES TO DO SOMETHING I CAN EASILY DO FOR MYSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) IN REHEARSAL, THAT WAS A SMALLER DONUT. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, AUDIENCE, SOMETIMES I'LL TALK TO MY PLANTS WHEN I'M LONELY. AND AFTER A FEW DRINKS, WELL, THE TALKING STOPS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M KIND OF GLAD CHIPOTLE HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF BAD PRESS BECAUSE IT MAKES THE LINE SHORTER. ( APPLAUSE ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE. I'M A TRUTHER, BUT ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER." WHEN TELEMARKETERS CALL ME AT HOME, I ASK IF THEY CAN HOLD ON FOR A SECOND, THEN LEAVE THE PHONE OFF THE HOOK AND GO JOGGING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I TAKE SALAD BAR SNEEZE GUARDS AS A PERSONAL CHALLENGE. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMETIMES, ON HOT DAYS, I GO INTO A GROCERY STORE AND PRETEND TO BE READING THE ICE CREAM LABELS JUST SO I CAN HOLD THE FREEZER DOOR OPEN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I DID TERRIBLE THINGS TO RISE TO THE TOP OF MY BARBERSHOP QUARTET. THEY SAY "IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING, SET IT FREE." BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST THOSE PEOPLE IN MY SHED. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FORGIVE ME, AUDIENCE. >> Audience: WE FORGIVE YOU! >> Stephen: THANKS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MELISSA McCARTHY AND BEN FALCONE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU, JON. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUESTS TONIGHT ARE HUSBAND AND WIFE AND THE DIRECTOR AND THE STAR OF THE NEW FILM "THE BOSS." >> WE'VE GOT TO GET ON A SCHEDULE IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE HERE. OH, MY GOD! CLOSE YOUR ROBE! >> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'M SELF-TAINCH TANNING AND MY LEGS ARE REAL WET. >> YOU NEED TO WIPE SOME OF THAT OFF YOUR FACE. YOU KNOW IT DRIES DARKER. >> DOES IT? >> YES. >> NOOSE NOT WHAT THE BOTTLE SAYS. IT'S OKAY. IT'S COMING OFF LIKE A DREAM ON YOUR TOWEL. >> YOU NEED TO CLEAN UP THE BATHROOM, AND CONSIDER STAYING AWAY FROM SELF-TANNER ALL TOGETHER. YOUR PELVISH REGION IS THE COLOR OF CURRY. >> MY MISTAKE, CLAIRE, THANK YOU. >> IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT. >> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MELISSA McCARTHY AND BEN FALCONE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: I GOTTA SAY, WE HAVE SOME LOVELY GUESTS HERE. NOT EVERYONE GETS A STANDING OVATION OUT THERE. THAT'S AWFULLY NICE, THAT'S AWFULLY NICE. >> OH, MY GOSH. THANK YOU FOR BEING THE LAST ONE STANDING. >> Stephen:  I THINK THEY MIGHT BE AS EXCITED AS I AM BECAUSE YOU ARE OUR FIRST CELEBRITY COUPLE. WE'VE NEVER HAD A CELEBRITY COUPLE BEFORE. >> AND WE PLAN ON DIVORCING AT THE END OF THE SHOW, JUST TO GIVE IT A BOOST. >> Stephen: DIVORCES AND WEDDINGS, HUGE RATINGS. >> WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN. >> Stephen: BEN FALCONE AND MELISSA McCARTHY, DO YOU HAVE A CELEBRITY NAME TOGETHER? BECAUSE LIKE A BENIFER, THING? I WAS THINKING ABOUT BENLISER McCARTCONE. >> SOME OF OUR FRIENDS CALL US FALL-CARGTY. >> Stephen: Mc-CART-CONE. >> THAT JUST KIND OF ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE. >> Stephen: IT DOES. THAT'S WHAT ON YOUR SHIRT? >> MY KIDS MADE THIS SHIRT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THAT'S REALLY NICE. >> SO THEY DECORATED THE SHIRT-- >> THEY MADE IT FOR FATHER'S DAY. >> YEAH, FOR FATHER'S DAY. AND I PROMISED VIVIAN I WOULD WEAR IT. AND GEORGIE THREATENED ME. >> Stephen: HOW OLD ARE THE KIDS? >> 8 AND 6. ALMOST 9 AND 6. >> Stephen: YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE 2005, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> Stephen: YOU MET EACH ENERGY 1998. WHAT TOOK SO LONG? >> I WAS ALWAYS LIKE ( COUGHING ) YOU CAN PUT SOMETHING THERE IF YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING. NO. TERRIBLE! >> Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT PICK-UP LINE. >> THAT'S FROM 1951 AND THAT'S HOW IT WORK S. >> Stephen:  YOU MET AT THE GROUND LINGS. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW IT'S A FAMOUS COMEDY IMPROV SHOP IN LOS ANGELES. HUGE NAMES HAVE COME OUT OF THERE. >> WE DID. WE STARTED WRITING AND PERFORMING AND BOMBING ALMOST, RIGHT WHEN WE MET. >> OUR FIRST SKETCH WAS ALL ABOUT-- YOU HAD TO PICK A HOLIDAY, SO YOU HAD TO CREATE ONE, AND THE SKETCH WAS -- >> YOU HAD TO CREATE A NEW HOLIDAY? >> A NEW HOLIDAY. SO WE CREATED ALL SEAGER'S EVE. ALL BOB SEGER. >.>> A HOLIDAY FOR BOB SEGER. >> Stephen: I BE THEY HAVE THOSE IN MICHIGAN. >> I REMEMBER WE WERE DRIVING AROUND IN THE CAR. WE WERE LIKE, "THIS CAN'T LOSE! THIS IS AMAZING!" ♪ LIKE A ROCK ♪ AND BOB SEGER COMES DOWN THE CHIMNEY. IT'S SO EXCITING. >> IT'S LIKE YOU WERE THERE. >> HE DID. AT ONE POINT I KNOW I SENT-- I WAS THE MOM IN IT, AND I WAS LIKE-- SOMEHOW THE BACK STORY WAS I ALWAYS BURN THE HAM. AND I WAS LIKE, "BUT NOT THIS YEAR. I NEVER MADE A HAM AT 350. THANK YOU, SEAGER." IT WAS NONSENSE. >> Stephen: IT WAS A BOB SEGER MIRACLE. >> IT WAS A BOB SEGER MIRACLE AFTER MIRACLE. >> Stephen: THE AUDIENCE DIDN'T ENJOY THIS. >> WE DIDN'T GET THERE. >> WE DIDN'T GET IT IN THE SHOW. WE WERE TOLD TO REWRITE IT. AND WHEN WE REWROTE IT WE SAID GREAT, THEY'RE MISSING THE BOAT, THE SAME SKETCH BUT WE WERE SCOTTISH. >> FOR THE REWRITE WHEN SOMEONE SAID, THIS, DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, "AND WE WERE LIKE, "THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT." WE'VE BEEN WRITING FOR 14 MINUTES. WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO WE BROUGHT BACK THE EXACT SAME CATCH AND CHANGED HOW WE SAID IT. THEY WERE JUST LIKE GET OFF THE STAGE. YOU MADE IT SO MUCH WORSE. >> Stephen: THE MOVIE "THE BOSS," IS BASED ON A CHARACTER THAT YOU DID AT THE GROUND LINGS AS WELL, RIGHT? >> 15, 16 YEARS AGO. >> Stephen: REALLY? >> YEAH. I KICKED IN THE DOOR TO-- WHAT WAS IT? >> "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE." >> AS YOU DO. I THOUGHT IF I WAS GOING TO KICK IN THE DOOR IT SHOULD BE TO "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE." I WENT INTO THE AUDIENCE, HAD RED HAIR AIR, TURTLENECK UP TO HERE, REALLY SIMILAR TO HOW SHE STILL LOOKS AND DID A SEMINAR ON HOW TO MAKE MONEY. >> Stephen: BECAUSE SHE'S THE RICHEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD. >> SHE'S THE 47th WEALTHIEST WOMAN AND THAT'S IMPORTANT. IT'S ALL REAL TO ME. >> Stephen: AND YOU DIRECTED THIS. >> YES. >> Stephen: IS IT HARD AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER? YOU CAN'T SAY-- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE AND SAY, "YOU CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT A BITCH MY DIVA IS!" YOU CAN'T SAY THAT. MAYBE YOU CAN. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SUCH A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP YOU CAN. >> IF THAT EVER DID OCCUR, I THINK I COULD. >> THAT WOULD BE GREAT. >> WE HAD A BLAST AND THE FAMILY IS ALL TOGETHER. WE GO HOME AND TALK ABOUT THE SAME STUFF WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR 16 YEARS. IT'S NOT LIKE LET'S GET OUT THE SPREADSHEETS. IT'S WHAT CAN WE DO BEDROOM. >> IT'S LIKE, "DO YOU THINK KRYSTEN BELL WELL THE ME TAKE HER BRA STRAPS AND SHAKEEM. >> Stephen: I HOPE THAT'S YOUR LINE. >> WHO DID COME UP WITH THAT? >> I DON'T REMEMBER. >> Stephen: DOES SHE LET YOU TAKE HER BRA STRAPS AND SHAKE THEM? >> THE ANSWER IS YES. >> Phil: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD MOVIE. >> RIGHT AFTER WE DID THE SCENE, AFTER BEN FED US BANANAS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE LOW WEBB AND OUR SUGAR MIGHT BE DOWN, HE FED US BANANAS LIKE WE WERE MONKEYS. >> I THINK KRYSTEN'S QUOTE WAS,"IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS LET'S REALLY BANG AROUND ON THESE THINGS." >> Stephen: SHE'S A PRO. >> THAT'S BUSINESS TALK IN THE WORLD OF SHOW. >> Stephen: I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT BANGING HER BANANAS. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WIEBT WITH MORE MELISSA McCARTHY AND BEN FALCONE. >> Stephen: I WISH SHE WAS HERE. YOU GUYS COULD MEET.
