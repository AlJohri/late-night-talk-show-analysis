STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN. >> Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT ENERGY. ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN THE ROOM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: RISING UP. WELCOME, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHY NOT? THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" THANK SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME HERE TONIGHT. WE ENJOY DOING THIS SHOW FOR YOU EVERY NIGHT. WE HAVE A GOOD TIME ON THE SHOW. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IN WAYS YOU DON'T GET TO SEE, WE ENJOY MAKING THE SHOW EVERY DAY. AND THIS PART OF THE SHOW THAT WE'RE DOING, THE TOP OF THE SHOW, WE USUALLY WRITE IN MY OFFICE AROUND NOON EVERY DAY. AND I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOUR OFFICE SITS ABOVE TIMES SQUARE, LIKE MINE DOES, THERE'S GOING TO BE NOISE. AS A NEW YORKER, I'M TOTALLY CAPABLE OF DROWNING OUT HORNS HONKING, SIRENS, TIMES SQUARE ELMO FIGHTS, GUN SHOTS, WOUNDED TIMES SQUARE ELMOS BEGGING FOR HELP-- THE USUAL NEW YORK STUFF. BUT TODAY I GOT TO SAY NEW YORK TOOK IT UP A NOTCH. AN UNHOLY WAIL STARTED FROM THE STREET THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GOOSE MAKING LOVE TO A SMOKE DETECTOR. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HEARD IT TODAY. IT WAS SO UNBELIEVABLE-- THIS IS TRUE-- IT WAS SO UNBELIEVABLE, I RECORDED IT WITH MY iPHONE. JIM. OOOOOOO! OOOOOOOO! AAARRRR. AAAAARRRR. NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THAT SOUND CAME FROM-- MY FIRST GUESS WAS LAND WHALES. I THOUGHT MAYBE IN DESPERATION THEY BEACHED THEMSELVES ON 53rd STREET AND WE WERE HEARING THEM DIE. THEN THE SOUND STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT WE CAN WRITE THIS PART OF THE SHOW. AND A FEW MINUTES LATER WE HEARD THIS. AAAHHH. AAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAA. >> Stephen: KIND OF MAKES IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE. >> WHAT DOES? >> Stephen: THAT SOUND. >> I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: KIND OF MAKES IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE ON RE-WRITING THE SHOW. ( MIMICS SOUND, ANOTHER SOUND STARTS ) ( APPLAUSE ) THEY REALLY SHOULD PUT CAGES ON THESE WINDOWS SO I DON'T HURL MYSELF OUT. WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) IS THAT? ( LAUGHTER ) OH, GOD. NOW, I NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT THAT SOUND WAS. I CAN ONLY ASSUME IT WAS THE END OF THE WORLD, AND THIS IS BEING BROADCAST RIGHT NOW TO A CHARRED HELLSCAPE ROAMED BY THE DAMNED. EITHER THAT OR GOD WAS PLAYING THE LARGEST CYRSTAL WINE GLASS EVER. AAAAHHHH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AAAAHHHH. THE POINT IS, THE FORCES OF DARKNESS TRIED TO STOP ME FROM DOOK THE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. BUT WE'RE WINNING, FOLKS, BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COME ON! FIRST UP, I'LL BE TALKING WITH COMEDIAN AND ACTOR, AZIZ ANSARI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHOSE NEW SHOW "MASTER OF NONE" IS ABOUT A 30-YEAR-OLD INDIAN-AMERICAN ACTOR. OOH, I HOPE IT'S MINDY KALING! THEN, I'LL BE JOINED BY CREATOR, WRITER, PRODUCER, AUTHOR SHONDA RHIMES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IT IS ENTIRELY, ENTIRELY POSSIBLE SHE'S GOT SOME NEW JOB TITLES SINCE I STARTED THAT SENTENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH BRUCE CAMPBELL AND LUCY LAWLESS. THEY'RE STARRING IN THE NEW THEY'RE STARRING IN THE NEW SERIES "ASH VERSUS EVIL DEAD, BASED ON THE CULT ZOMBIE MOVIES. THEY'LL FEEL RIGHT AT HOME BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PICK THEIR BRAINS. ( BAND PLAYING ) THAT SOUND CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING: IT'S TIME TO SAY HI TO JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK OUT THE JAZZ JAMS. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: THE NATIONAL HOT DOG AND SAUSAGE COUNCIL ANNOUNCED THAT HOT DOGS AREN'T SANDWICHES, BUT THEY STILL CLING TO THEIR DESPERATE IDEA THAT HOT DOGS ARE FOOD. ♪ ♪ ♪ TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES AZIZ ANSARI. SHONDA RHIMES. BRUCE CAMPBELL AND LUCY LAWLESS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NEW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU! YEAH! YEAH! >> Jon: YEAH! >> Stephen: WOOO! >> Jon: OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH! >> Stephen: WOOOO! YEAH! THANKS. FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR WATCHING. THANKS FOR WATCHING THE SHOW. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR WATCHING OUT THERE. I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE-- >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN. >> Stephen: I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE IN TELEVISION WATCHING, BECAUSE TONIGHT, TONIGHT IS IS-- TONIGHT IS A HUGE NIGHT IN POLITICS. IT'S THE FOURTH REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE. NOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET BECAUSE WE TAPE THIS SHOW EARLY-- AND ALSO BECAUSE "PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME--" BUT TONIGHT ONE THING WE KNOW IS TONIGHT IS MAKE OR BREAK FOR JEB!, WHO BEEN STRUGGLING TO SHOW HE CAN BE A STRONG LEADER. BUT YESTERDAY, IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION HE GOT ON THE INTERNET, GOVERNOR BUSH TOOK A BOLD STAND. >> "IF YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND KILL BABY HITLER, WOULD YOU DO IT?" HELL, YEAH, I WOULD! >> Stephen: HELL, YEAH, HE WOULD! THAT'S POLITICS 101: SHAKE THE HAND, KISS THE BABY, KILL BABY HITLER! NOW, JUST TO BE CLEAR, CAN WE PUT UP A PICTURE OF JEB BUSH'S INTENDED TARGET? THERE YOU GO. REMEMBER, IT'S HITLER! CAN WE HITLER HIM UP A LITTLE BIT? THERE YOU GO. LOOK AT THOSE EVIL LITTLE CHEEKS! WHO'S THE GREATEST MONSTER OF THE 20th CENTURY? YOU ARE! YOUR UNCLE JEB'S GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU! STABBITY, STAB, STAB. ( LAUGHTER ) SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT. AND THIS IS A DANGEROUS MISSION BECAUSE JEB OF ALL PEOPLE KNOWS THE HIGH STAKES OF TIME TRAVEL. >> THE PROBLEM WITH GOING BACK IN HISTORY AND DOING THAT IS, AS WE KNOW FROM THE SERIES, WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE MICHAEL FOX MOVIES? >> "BACK TO THE FUTURE"? >> "BACK TO THE FUTURE." IT HAS-- IT COULD HAVE A DANGEROUS EFFECT ON EVERYTHING ELSE. >> THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER. >> BUT I'D DO IT. I MEAN, HITLER! >> Stephen: YES, AS WE LEARNED IN "BACK TO THE FUTURE," STARRING WELL-KNOWN ACTOR MICHAEL FOX, TIME TRAVEL COULD HAVE ALL KINDS OF UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES. I MEAN, REMEMBER GERMAN REICH MARSHAL WOLFGANG MEINHARDT? NO, OF COURSE, YOU DOANLTS BECAUSE SOMEONE WENT BACK IN TIME AND KILLED HIM AS A BABY, PREVENTING WORLD WAR 1.5 AND YET, WORLD WAR II HAPPENED ANYWAY. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHY IT'S SO CRUCIAL THIS QUESTION COMES UP AT TONIGHT'S DEBATE. WHEN TIME TRAVEL TECHNOLOGY ARRIVES, YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL BE THE FIRST ONE TO USE IT. AND YOU WANT A TRUSTWORTHY LEADER AT THE HELM OF "TIME FORCE ONE," SOMEONE WHO'LL USE IT RESPONSIBLY AND NOT WASTE IT ON TAKING JESUS ON A PTERADACTYL RIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE FUN. I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE FUN. ( APPLAUSE ) BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE PRIORITIES. NOW, BEN CARSON HAS SAID IF HE COULD GO BACK IN TIME HE WOULD PREVENT THE HOLOCAUST BY GIVING JEWS GUNS. OF COURSE, BEN CARSON WOULDN'T KILL HITLER HIMSELF. AS A DOCTOR, HE SWORE: FIRST, DO NO HARM. SECOND, GIVE EVERYONE GUNS. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BUT HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO WITH A TIME MACHINE: >> Audience: OOOOH! >> Stephen: IF I WAS, HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO WITH A TIME MACHINE. I, TOO, WOULD TRAVEL BACK TO THE TIME OF BABY HITLER, BUT THIS IS WHERE ME AND JEB'S TIMESTREAMS START TO DIVERGE BECAUSE I WOULDN'T KILL YOUNG ADOLF. I WOULD TAKE HIM FROM HIS PARENTS AND RAISE HIM WITH LOVE. HEAR ME OUT, OKAY. I WOULD GIVE HITLER A SAFE, SUPPORTIVE HOME. ALL THE WHILE, I WOULD WATCH HIM LIKE A HAWK. I WOULDN'T LET HIM JOIN ANYTHING WHERE YOU HAVE TO WEAR A UNIFORM. NO CUB SCOUTS, NO LITTLE LEAGUE, DEFINITELY NO MARCHING BAND. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'D TEACH BABY HITLER THAT WE DON'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS WITH VIOLENCE. AND THEN, IF HE STARTS GETTING MOUTHY AS A TEENAGER, I'LL STICK A KNIFE IN HIS RIBS AND SNAP OFF THE HANDLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY? AND IF THAT ATTACK FAILS, AND THE HORROR OF BEING STABBED BY A PERSON HE THINKS IS HIS FATHER, TURNS HIM INTO A MONSTROUS DICTATOR, IT'S EASILY FIXABLE. I'LL JUST GO BACK IN TIME AND KILL BABY ME. YOU'RE WELCOME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, UNLESS WE ALREADY ARE. ( BAND PLAYING ) IT'S ALL RIGHT ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING? ANYBODY HERE PLAY "CANDY CRUSH"? WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED SO MANY OF YOU DO BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST BIG FUN. IT'S BIG BUSINESS. >> THE COMPANY THAT MAKES "CANDY CRUSH" HAS BEEN SOLD FOR A STAGGERING $5.9 BILLION. >> ACTIVISION BLIZZARD ANNOUNCED PLANS OVERNIGHT TO ACQUIRE KING DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT FOR $5.9 BILLION. ACTIVISION BEST KNOWN FOR MORE TRADITIONAL GAMES LIKE "GUITAR HERO" AND "CALL OF DUTY." >> Stephen: YES, "CANDY CRUSH" GOT SOLD FOR $5.9 BILLION. THAT'S EVEN MORE THAN DISNEY PAID FOR "STAR WARS," OR APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH I WOULD PAY TO SEE THE NEXT "STAR WARS" MOVIE RIGHT NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO WHY DID THEY SPEND SO MUCH MONEY? WHY ALL THE CASH? WELL, PARTLY BECAUSE LAST YEAR, THROUGH IN-APP PURCHASES, CANDY CRUSH'S 474 MILLION MONTHLY USERS SPENT $1.3 BILLION. AT LEAST SOME OF THAT WASN'T FROM WHEN DYLAN'S MOM LEFT HER PHONE ON THE COUNTER. BUT POSSIBLY, BECAUSE ACTIVISION BLIZARD JUST ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF THEIR OWN MOVIE AND TELEVISION STUDIO TO MAKE FILMS BASED ON THEIR GAMES SUCH AS "CALL OF DUTY." TO STAY TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL "CALL OF DUTY" WHILE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE, THERE'LL BE A 12-YEAR-OLD SITTING NEXT TO YOU TELLING YOU HOW MUCH YOU SUCK. CLEARLY, IF I'M READING THIS RIGHT, CLEARLY, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE ACTIVISION MAKES A MOVIE OUT OF "CANDY CRUSH," FEATURING NO DOUBT AN ALL-STAR CAST LED BY LIAM NEESON AS MR. TOFFEE. AND EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T EXIST, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLIP. JIM? >> MY SON. >> Stephen: OH, FATHER, YOU'VE BEEN PIERCED WITH A CANDY CANE! STAY STILL. I'LL GET HELP. SOMEONE, CALL THE DONUT DOCTOR! >> NO, NO, SON. IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT. MY GAME IS OVER. AS OUR PEOPLE SAY, I AM OUT OF MOVES. >> Stephen: DON'T SAY THAT, FATHER. YOU JUST NEED TO EAT. HERE, I BROUGHT YOU SOME LEMON DROPS! >> DINE! >> Stephen: I'M SUCH A FOOL! I PUT THREE OF THEM TOGETHER, AND THEY DISAPPEARED! SO SORRY. >> IT'S ALL RIGHT, MY SON. NOT EVEN A TRIPLE COLOR BOMB COMBO COULD SAVE ME NOW. WHERE-- WHERE WERE YOU? >> Stephen: FATHER, I WAS STUCK AT THE ICE CREAM CAVES. I WAS CLEARING ALL THE JELLIES, JUST AS YOU TAUGHT ME, FATHER! >> DID YOU, DID YOU SLIDE THE RED ONES DOWN? >> Stephen: I DID. >> GOOD BOY. DID YOU SLIDE THE BLUE ONES, RIGHT? >> Stephen: YES! I EVEN GOT ONE OF THOSE SICK COMBO CHAIN REACTIONS GOING. I CRUSHED AS MANY AS I COULD, AND THE GUMMY FISHES TRIED TO HELP, BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH. >> IT'S OKAY, SON. YOU'VE GIVEN AN OLD MAN HIS FINAL SUGAR RUSH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, LEAVE ME. YOU MUST DEFEAT THE BUBBLEGUM TROLL BEFORE HE REACHES BUTTERSCOTCH BOULDERS. >> Stephen: BUT I CAN'T DO THAT! >> YOU CAN! YOU MUST! YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED: SKILL, STRATEGY, AND MY LOLLIPOP HAMMER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: OH, BUT, FATHER, I CAN'T. >> DAMN IT, BOY, TAKE IT! THERE'S NO PLACE IN THIS SWEET WORLD FOR YOUR SALTY TEARS. >> Stephen: BUT, FATHER, I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU HERE LIKE SOME WORTHLESS LICORICE SWIRL! >> HUSH, SON. -- I-- HAD A GOOD LIFE. I SPENT MY BEST YEARS CRUSHING CANDY. AND, YES, AS I CRUSHED, I WOULD SOMETIMES THINK, "THIS IS A HUGE WASTE OF TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I COULD BE READING A BOOK, OR ANYTHING." BUT I KEPT ON GOING. I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN THE BEST FATHER. THERE WERE WALLS BETWEEN US-- BEAUTIFUL, SHINY WALLS OF JELLYBEANS AND LOZENGES. AND NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRIED TO BREAK DOWN THOSE WALLS, THERE'D BE A NEW LEVEL, AND, WELL, THERE'D JUST BE NEW WALLS. WALLS THAT KEPT ME FROM YOU. NOW THAT I'M DYING, I REALIZE-- I REALIZE, I-- ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION? ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT? GO BANNING. THIS LEVEL IS REALLY HARD. >> SON, MY TIMER HAS NEARLY RUN OUT, AND THERE'S SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU LONG AGO. I... LOVE... >> Stephen: LET'S SEE, HERE. 99 CENTS? YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO. FATHER! NO! YOU ARE GONE, BUT I SHALL CRUSH ON IN YOUR MEMORY. AND FROM THE MINTY MEADOW TO THE FUDGE FJORD, YOUR LEGACY SHALL FOREVER BE REMEMBERED BECAUSE I WILL SHARE YOUR HIGH SCORE ON FACEBOOK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LIAM NEESON, EVERYONE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH AZIZ ANSARI. FATHER NO! FATHER! ( BAND PLAYING ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A STAND-UCH COMEDIAN ( BAND PLAYING ) , AN ACTOR, AN AUTHOR, WITH A NEW SHOW ON NETFLIX CALLED "MASTER OF NONE." PLEASE WELCOME AZIZ ANSARI. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. THIS IS SO COOL. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SHOW. >> Stephen: YOU WEREN'T HERE WHEN DAVE HOSTED THE HOE? >> I WAS THERE IN THAT CARNATION. >> Stephen: SAME BUILDING. >> IT'S THE SAME PLACE BUT IT'S A NEW CHAIR. >> Stephen: THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY CHANGE SO FAR IS THE CHAIRS. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET A FELLOW SOUTH CAROLINIAN. >> THAT'S PRETTY COOL. WE'RE BOTH FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. STEPHEN IS THE FIRST LATE NIGHT HOST FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, AND THE BAJILLIONth WHITE GUY. VERY INTERESTING MEASURE OF PROGRESS. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: YOU TALKED ABOUT THE-- NOT ENOUGH, LIKE, PEOPLE OF COLOR, MINORITIES, REPRESENTED ON TELEVISION. IS HAVING YOU ON MY SHOW, DOES THAT COUNT AT ALL? >> YEAH. >> Stephen: DOES IT COUNT? >> YEAH. >> Stephen: I'M TRYING TO DO MY PART. I'M TRYING TO DO MY PART. >> IT'S REALLY DIVERSE RIGHT NOW. 50%. >> Stephen: 50% OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT WHITE. >> THIS IS LIKE AN ALL-TIME HIGH FOR CBS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU DID THAT. >> Stephen: HEY, MAN. I DO MY PART. I DO WHAT I CAN. WELL, YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS. YOU STARRED ON "PARKS AND REC." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU SOLD OUT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN TWICE IN ONE NIGHT. YOU'VE WRITTEN THE BESTSELLING BOOK "MODERN LOVE." >> "MODERN ROMANCE." >>> Stephen: REALLY. MY CARD SAYS "MODERN LOVE." >> SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET FIRED. >> Stephen: GOD, I HOPE IT'S A WHITE GUY. YEAH, YEAH. CHANCES ARE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: CHANCES ARE, CHANCES ARE. >> THERE ARE A LOT OF WHITE GUYS BACK THERE. >> Stephen: THERE ARE, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE IN A BOX, AND THEY MULTIPLY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR NEW SHOW IS CALLED "MASTER OF NONE." >> THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: WHAT DOES "MASTER OF NONE" MEAN, FIRST OF ALL? >> IT'S SO HARD TO COME UP WITH A TITLE AND "MASTER OF NONE" JUST SOUNDED COOL. IT ACTUALLY DOES KIND OF MAKE SENSE IN THE THEMES OF THE SHOW. IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY WHO REALLY FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE'S A DEVELOPED ADULT. HE'S NOT LIKE A MAN-CHILD BUT HE'S STILL LEARNING A LOT ABOUT LIFE AND WHATNOT. SO HE'S KIND OF A MASTER OF NONE. I DON'T KNOW. >> Stephen: IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S GOT ALL THE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF BEING ADULT BUT HE HASN'T GOT HIS ( BLEEP ) TOGETHER. >> YEAH. THAT'S-- THAT IS ACTUALLY-- THAT SHOULD BE THE LOG LINE OF THE SHOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO PUT IT. THAT REALLY IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. >> Stephen: CAN'T SAY IT ON CBS BUT YOU CAN SAY IT ON NETFLIX WHERE YOU ARE. IT'S RELEASED NOW, RIGHT? >> NOW STREAMING AS THEY SAY. >> Stephen: SHOULD I, SHOULD I-- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO VIEW IT? PARSE IT OUT IN LITTLE AZIZ BITES THROUGHOUT THE WEEK OR WOULD YOU WANT ME TO CONSUME IT IN ONE-- DO YOU WANT ME TO JUST BINGE IT? >> I THINK YOU JUST WATCH IT ALL. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> YEAH. LIKE DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE UNTIL YOU WATCH ALL 10. LIKE, DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE. >> Stephen: WOW. YEAH. I JUST WON'T DO THE SHOW NEXT WEEK. >> OH, NO! DO THE SHOW. START IN THE MORNING. >> Stephen: ANOTHER ALL RIGHT. DO YOU-- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU BINGE ON NETFLIX? DO YOU HAVE FELLOW NETFLIXIANS, YOU GO, "MAN, THAT'S A GOOD SHOW." >> YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SO BUSY WORKING ON THAT THING I HAVEN'T WATCHED THAT MUCH. >> Stephen: AND I'M SUPPOSED TO WATCH ALL OF YOUR SHOWS IN ONE DAY. PHYSICIANS, HEAL THYSELF. SPEAK OF PHYSICIANS AND HEALING YOURSELVES, YOUR DAD SAY DOCTOR, RIGHT? >> MY DAD IS A DOCTOR. >> Stephen: AND YOU CAST YOUR OWN PARENTS TO PLAY YOUR PARENTS IN THE SHOW. >> DI. >> Stephen: WHY DID YOU CAST YOUR PARENTS GIWROTE THE CHARACTERS BASED ON MY PARENTS, AND WHENEVER WE BROUGHT IN THE PEOPLE TO AUDITION, NONE OF THEM FELT RIGHT, AND GETTING A WHITE GUY AND DOING BROWN FACE SEEMED LIKE IT WOULDN'T BE PROPER. >> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T ASK ME. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T ASK ME. WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU AND YOUR DAD TALKING ABOUT BASICALLY MAKING DECISIONS IN LIFE AND SETTLING DOWN. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: JIM, LET'S TAKE A LOOK. >> I MEAN, WHOEVER YOU'RE DATEATH THIS AGE COULD BE WHO YOU END UP WITH. IT'S A BIG DECISION. IT'S HARD. >> YOU ARE SO INDECISIVE. WHEN YOU WERE A KID, YOU SAID, "DAD, CAN I PLAY SOCCER? CAN I PLAY TENNIS? CAN I PLAY BASKETBALL?" ME, I'M SO DECISIVE. I PLAY GOLF, I CHOSE YOUR MOM. WE GOT MARRIED RIGHT AWAY. NO PROBLEM. >> YEAH, BUT THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT. IT WAS AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE. HOW MANY WOMEN DID YOU MEET BEFORE YOU DECIDED ON MOM? >> TWO. >> TWO? THAT'S IT? WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE FIRST LADY? >> SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO TALL. AS SOON AS SHE STOOD UP, I WAS LIKE OH, NO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: HE'S GREAT. HE'S GREAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT MUST BE NICE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: PEOPLE SAY-- PEOPLE SAY YOUR DAD-- YOUR PARENTS ARE LIKE STEALING SCENES FROM YOU. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: LET'S LET YOUR DAD STEAL THE INTERVIEW FROM YOU. DR. ANSARI, WOULD YOU COME OUT PLEASE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT OVER HERE. NOW, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK IN JUST A SECOND, BUT BEFORE WE DO, WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOUR SON ASKED YOU TO PLAY YOURSELF IN HIS TV SHOW? >> WELL, IT IS A LONG DREAM TO COME TRUE. >> Stephen: YOUR LONG DREAM COME TRUE, REALLY? DID YOU WANT TO BE AN ACTOR? >> WHEN I WAS SMALL I USED TO THINK OF ACTING. MY DAD TOLD ME-- ( LAUGHTER ) "ACTING DOESN'T GIVE MONEY. BE A DOCTOR." SO I FOLLOWED THE ADVICE OF MY FATHER. >> Stephen: WHO MAKES MORE MONEY NOW? ( LAUGHTER ) >> YOU KNOW THAT? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ME. >> Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE REAL ANSARI, DR. ANSARI. STICK AROUND.

NOW YOU HAD AN EPISODE ON IMMIGRANT PARENTS. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: ON THE SHOW. WHICH YOU SAID IS VERY UNIVERSAL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY ABOUT UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? >> WELL I THINK EVEN I ONLY REALIZED HOW UNGRATEFUL I WAS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AS AN ADULT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MY FATHER MOVED HERE TO SOUTH CAROLINA, NOT THE MOST OPEN-ARMS PLACE FOR PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE HE DOES. >> Stephen: THOUGH NOW, THOUGH NOW, YOU GUYS MIGHT BE MORE SOUTH CAROLINIAN THAN I AM BECAUSE OUR GOVERNOR, NIKKI HALEY, IS ALSO INDIAN-AMERICAN. >> THAT'S TRUE. >> Stephen: WHAT'S THE UNIVERSALITY OF UNGRATEFULNESS. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN. WHEN I HAD-- HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN AZIZ WAS BORN. DID YOU FEEL UNGRATEFUL TO YOUR PARENTS IN ANY WAY WHEN YOU SAW YOUR SON? >> I ALWAYS FEEL HE WILL BE A GOOD ONE, AND, LIKE ME, HE WILL BE GRATEFUL TO ME. THAT IS THE RULE -- >> HAS HE BEEN? HAS HE BEEN GRATEFUL TO YOU? >> YES, YES. >> Stephen: GRATEFUL ENOUGH? >> UH... OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE AN ACTOR? DID YOU WANT HIM TO BE A DOCTOR? >> YEAH. YOU KNOW, I WANTED HIM TO BE A DOCTOR, BUT HE CALLED ME ONE DAY AND SAID, "DADDY, I WANT TO BE A FULL TIME--" HE SAID HE WANTED TO BE A COMEDIAN, STAND-UP COMEDIAN, I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT STAND-UP COMEDY MEANS. >> Stephen: DID YOU THINK LIKE A CLOWN, BIG SHOES. >> HE SAYS, "I'LL STAND UP AND SELL JOKES IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE." "OH, IS THAT A JOB? GOOD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELL, AZIZ, LIKE YOUR DAD'S HERE, I'M A MARRIED MAN WITH CHILDREN. ARE YOU GOING TO SETTLE DOWN? IS IT TIME? IS IT TIME FOR TO YOU SETTLE DOWN AND GET MARRIED. >> UH, I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT-- >> WE WANT HIM TO SETTLE DOWN. IT IS TIME.

YOU'VE GOT "GREY'S ANATOMY." "HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER" AT 10:00. >> YES, YES. >> Stephen: IF YOU, LIKE, COUGH OVER AT ABC, DO THEY GO, "WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT A SHOW ABOUT-- IS THAT "COUGHING COPS?" IS IT COPS THAT COUGH WITH A CODE? >> THEY'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE. >> Stephen: ARE THEY REALLY? >> YES. >> Stephen: DO YOU ENJOY MAKING THESE SHOWS? BECAUSE YOU HAVE THREE OF THEM A WEEK TO HELP PUMP OUT. DO YOU ACTUALLY LIKE THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE SHOW? >> I DO. I LOVE IT. IT'S REALLY FUN. THINK ABOUT IT, I GET TO TYPE "INTERIOR OVAL OFFICE" AND THEY GET TO BUILD ME AN OVAL OFFICE AND I GET TO PLAY IN IT BEFORE THEY SHOOT STUFF. IT'S REALLY FUN. >> Stephen: YOU GET TO SAY, M, NIEC, LIAM NEESON IN A "CANDY CRUSH" OUTFIT. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST JOBS YOU CAN HAVE. >> IT'S AMAZING. >> Stephen:  YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK CALLED "YEAR OF YES" "HOW TO DANCE IT OUT, STAND IN THE SUN, AND BE YOUR OWN PERSON." YOU DID A YEAR OF SAYING YES TO THINGS THAT PREVIOUSLY SCARED YOU. >> I DID. >> Stephen: THINGS LIKE WHAT, A CLOWN APPEARING AT YOUR DOOR SPLATTERED IN BLOOD SAYING, "I CAN COME IN AND SHARPEN MY CLEAVER?" WHAT ARE THE THINGS? >> I SAID YES TO THINGS LIKE COMING ON A TALK SHOW. IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED ME A HUGE PANIC ATTACK AND TEARSES AND I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME OUT HERE. I MIGHT HAVE FAINTED ON YOUR FLOOR. >> Stephen: GOOD TV. >> IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD TV. >> Stephen: IF YOU WANT TO, GO RIGHT AHEAD. >> PUBLIC SPEAKING OF ANY TIME. >> Stephen: YOU WENT TO DARTMOUTH AND GAVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH. >> DI, I DID. THAT WAS MY FIRST BIG "YES." MY SECOND BIG "YES" OF DOING THINGS I WAS SCARED OF. >> Stephen: THE THEME OF IT WHICH WAS, DON'T FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS WAS THE THEME. YOUR SPEECH. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: I, ON A CERTAIN LEVEL BELIEVE WITH YOU. WHAT DID YOU MEAN ABOUT, "DON'T FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS?" >> I MEANT PEOPLE WHO ARE DREAMERS DON'T EVER DO THE THINGS THEY WANT TO DO. THEY SPEND THEIR TIME DREAMING INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY DOING, AND THE PEOPLE WHO DO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GET SOMEWHERE. >> Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT. CHUCK CLOSE, THE PAINTER, HE SAID, "INSPIRATION IS FOR AMATEURS. THE REST OF US SHOW UP AND WORK." >> YEAH. >> Stephen: YEAH, AND IF EVERYBODY FOLLOWED THEIR DREAMS, WHO THEY WANTED TO BE WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN, THE WORLD WOULD JUST BE PACKED WITH PRINCESSAND COWBOYS. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: DID YOU HAVE A DREAM? WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER? >> I WANTED TO BE TONY MORRISON. I WANTED TO BE A NOVELIST LIKE TONY MORRISON. >> Stephen: WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT? >> TONY MORRISON ALREADY HAS THE JOB. >> Stephen: WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS "YEAR OF YES" THAT YOU SAID, YEAH, NO. MY YES IS A BIG NO TO THAT? ONE THING DID YOU IS YOU SAID YES TO HEALTH. YOU LOST 117 POUNDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> I DID, I DID. I DID. THAT WAS ONE. >> Stephen: YEAH. THAT IS-- THAT IS SAYING NO TO A LOT OF THINGS, LOSE 117 POUNDS. >> IT WAS. IT WAS SAYING NO TO A LOT OF THINGS. BUT IT WAS ALSO SAYING YES TO WANTING TO HANG AROUND FOR A LOT LONGER. >> Stephen: YOU HAD A FRIEND WHO SAID, "YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING FUN." >> YEAH. >> Stephen: LIKE YOU RUN THREE TV SHOWS. THAT'S FUN. WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY, "YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING FUN?" >> MY OLDER SISTER DOLORES SAID I NEVER SAID YES TO ANYTHING. SHE MEANT I GO TO WORK AND COME HOME. YOU THINK PEOPLE WHO WORK IN HOLLYWOOD HAVE FANCY HOLLYWOOD LIVES. IDS AND I WAS WORKIN WORKING AND COMING HOME. I WAS A WORKAHOLIC. THAT WAS IT. >> Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA OF FUN? >> LAYING ON THE SOFA AND WATCHING "GAME OF THRONES." >> Stephen: SOUND PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY. >> IT WAS PRETTY FUN. >> Stephen: YOU MENTIONED YOUR OLDER SISTER. YOU'RE THE BABY OF A BIG FAMILY, RIGHT? >> YOUNGEST OF SIX. >> Stephen: I'M THE YOUNGEST OF 11. I KNOW THAT FEELING. ISN'T IT GREAT BEING THE BABY? >> I LOVE IT. THEY THINK I'M HELPLESS.

BRUCE, YOU PLAY ASH, AND I ASSUME YOU'RE THERE TO KICK A LITTLE ASH. >> YES, BECAUSE HE'S AN ASH HOLE. YET AGAIN HE HAS RELEASED A DEADITE PLAGUE WHICH KILLED MY FAMILY. I'M A LITTLE CHAGRINED ABOUT THAT. HE THINKS I'M WAAH-WAAH, ABOUT MY FAMILY BEING BUTCHERED. >> IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO CLARIFY THIS, JUST TO AIR THIS OUT. YOUR DUMB FATHER, MR. KNOWBY IN "EVIL DEAD 2" FOUND THIS BOOK. "I'M GOING TO TRANSLATE THIS BOOK." AND HE INTERESTED OUT LOUD. YOUR DUMB-ASS FATHER RELEASED THE DEMONS. I'M GOING TO PUT AN END TO IT. YOUR FATHER BEGAN IT. SO YOU SHOULD GET PISSED AT YOUR DUMB OLD MAP, NOT THE GUY WHO IS TRYING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION. >> Stephen: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE HAVE A CLIP THAT DEALS WITH THIS EXACT THING. JIM, LET'S SETTLE THIS. >> NUMBER ONE, IT'S MY BOOK, HAS BEEN FOR 30 YEARS. NUMBER TWO, I'M ON YOUR DAMN PROPERTY BECAUSE I'M HERE TO SAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING I CALL EARTH. >> YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING THESE PAST 30 YEARS? CLEANING UP YOUR MESSES SO THEY DON'T DESTROY A GIANT THING THAT EVERYONE CALLS THE EARTH. WHAT HAVE YOU ACCOMPLISHED IN ALL THESE YEARS? YOU PUT A CHAIN SAW ON YOUR STUMP. CONGRATULATIONS. >> YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. NAME ONE OTHER PERSON THAT YOU KNOW THAT HAS A FUNCTIONING CHAIN SAW ARM. >> THIS HAS TO STOP.
