( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." HEY, EVERYBODY! THAT'S NICE. THAT'S REALLY NICE. HEY, DOWN THERE, UP THERE, OUT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FEELING GOOD? I FEEL FANTASTIC. THAT'S RIGHT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." THANKS SO MUCH. I AM STEPHEN COLBERT. HOW IS EVERYBODY FEELING TONIGHT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ME, TOO. ME, TOO. I AM IN A SPECTACULAR MOOD THIS EVENING, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT MAY BE HAPPENING OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-- AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM-- I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING TODAY THAT RESTORES MY FAITH IN THE INDOMITABLE HUMAN SPIRIT, AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF A YOUNG MAN NAMED BEN INNES. HE WAS ON AN EGYPTAIR FLIGHT THAT WAS HIJACKED YESTERDAY BY A GUY WEARING WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SUICIDE VEST, AND IN THE FACE OF THIS ACT OF TERROR, BEN INNES HAD THE BEST POSSIBLE RESPONSE. HE ASKED THE HIJACKER FOR A SELFIE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE YOUR CELL PHONE ON A PLANE, BUT YOU'RE ALSO REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO WEAR A SUICIDE VEST. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THIS PHOTOGRAPH-- I BELIEVE THIS PHOTOGRAPH EPITOMIZES, RIGHT HERE, THIS EPITOMIZES TWO OF MY FAVORITE HUMAN ATTRIBUTES: BRAVERY AND RIDICULOUSNESS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. >> Jon: THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: LOOK AT THAT GOOFY GRIN. THIS MAN STARED IN THE FACE OF DEATH AND SAID "CHEESE!" NOW, IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS WASN'T ACTUALLY A BOMB AND EVERYBODY ON THE PLANE WAS FINE. THEY ALL GOT OUT. BUT BEN DID NOT KNOW THIS AT THE TIME. HE THOUGHT HE WAS FACING A REAL MADMAN AND HE SAID, "( BLEEP ). AS HE EXPLAINED: "WE WERE SITTING AROUND WAITING. I THOUGHT, WHY NOT? IF HE BLOWS US ALL UP, IT WON'T MATTER ANYWAY.'" YEAH! YEAH! YES! "IT WON'T MATTER ANYWAY." YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE SOME TIME TO MAKE FUN OF HIM. IT'S THE EXACT SAME REASON WHY DAFFY DUCK FOUGHT HITLER. AND IT'S WHY, WHEN THE ROMANS WERE BURNING HIM ALIVE ON AN IRON GRILL, ST. LAWRENCE SAID-- AND I QUOTE-- "TURN ME OVER. I'M DONE ON THIS SIDE." OKAY. AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOFY-FACED SELFIE TO TAKE THE WIND OUT OF EVIL'S SAILS. THIS WORKS, THIS PHOTO WORKS, THIS WORKS RIGHT HERE WHEN YOU PUT BEN NEXT TO ANY BAD GUY. DARTH VADER OR SKELETOR OR MARNIE FROM "GIRLS." SO, BEN, I SALUTE YOU. THIS, THIS WAS REALLY STUPID. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I PROMISE, I MEAN THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. AND HERE'S THE THING-- YOU'VE INSPHIERD ME TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GIVE ME THAT! GIVE ME THAT! NO, I CAN'T. I GOTTA HAVE IT. I GOTTA HAVE IT. >> Jon: YEAH, BABY. >> Stephen: FIRST, FROM "MODERN FAMILY" AND THE HBO FILM "CONFIRMATION," ERIC STONESTREET IS HERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THEN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH FORMER "DAILY SHOW" CORRESPONDENT AND THE STAR OF THE NEW SITCOM "THE DETOUR," JASON JONES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLUS, I'LL BE TALKING WITH SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ >> Stephen: HEY! HEY! I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI TO THE BAND, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET THIS NIGHT STARTED RIGHT, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: A MINNESOTA COMPANY HAS INVENTED A HANDGUN THAT FOLDS UP TO LOOK LIKE A CELLPHONE. THOUGH, SERIOUSLY, WHO STILL USES A FLIP-GUN? >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ERIC STONESTREET. JASON JONES. AND SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU. I JUST-- IS THAT NOT FANTASTIC? THAT IS JUST-- THAT IS JUST JOY OVER FEAR. I JUST LOVE THIS. >> Stephen: YEAH, HE'S WILD. >> Stephen: ISN'T THAT AMAZING? I WOULD LOVE TO THINK I WOULD DO THIS, TOO. >> Jon: I WOULDN'T DO THAT. I WOULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT DIE. >> Stephen: RIGHT! BUT HE KNEW THAT AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT, I MIGHT DIE, BUT I THINK I MIGHT ALSO HAVE SOME BIG, BRAZ BALLS." I JUST CAN'T GET OVER HOW MUCH HOPE THIS GIVES ME, YOU KNOW. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> Stephen: THAT DOING-- THAT DOING STUPID STUFF MIGHT MAKE US SAFE, YOU KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ) MIGHT SAVE US, MIGHT SAVE HUMANITY. STUPIDITY MIGHT SAVE HUMANITY IN THE FACE OF MADMEN. SPEAKING OF STUPID AND MADMEN, DONALD TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Jon: I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT. >> Stephen: THE LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAS PROVEN HIMSELF NOTORIOUSLY UNPREDICTABLE, EXCEPT TO HIS BUTLER IT TURNS OUT, WHO RECENTLY IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES," REVEALED HIS SECRET WARDROBE-BASED SYSTEM FOR READING TRUMP'S MOODS. TURNS OUT IN THE MORNING, "MR. TRUMP WOULD EMERGE IN KHAKIS, A WHITE GOLF GOLF SHIRT, AND BASEBALL CAP. IF THE CAP WAS WHITE, THE STAFF NOTICED, THE BOSS WAS IN A GOOD MOOD. IF IT WAS RED, IT WAS BEST TO STAY AWAY. IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, "CAP OF WHITE, FRIEND IN SIGHT. CAP OF RED, WE'RE ALL DEAD." STILL UNCLEAR WHAT IT MEANS WHEN TRUMP WEARS THAT HAY-COVERED SWIM CAP. NEUTRAL. NEUTRAL. AND I'M GUESSING HE'S GOING TO BE WEARING THE RED HAT ALL WEEK, BECAUSE HE'S HAD A ROUGH ONE. FIRST, HE UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE BY TWEETING THIS UNFLATTERING COMPARISON BETWEEN HIS WIFE MELANIA AND TED CRUZ'S WIFE HEIDI. SOME SAY THIS IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL BEHAVIOR, BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THE ELECTION OF 1860, WHEN THE STEPHEN DOUGLAS CAMPAIGN COMPARED MARY TODD LINCOLN UNFAVORABLY TO a SHEEP IN HEAT. THAT'S HISTORY. THAT'S HISTORY. THAT'S-- WE DIDN'T MAKE THIS UP. THAT'S HISTORY. LAST NIGHT DONALD TRUMP HAD TO ANSWER FOR THAT RETWEET AT A TOWN HALL, WHEN HE WAS GRILLED BY CNN CORRESPONDENT AND THE LEGOLAS OF CABLE NEWS, ANDERSON COOPER. >> AFTER SAYING THAT YOU WERE GOING TO SPILL THE BEANS ABOUT HEIDI CRUZ, YOU REPEATED UNFLATTERING PICTURE OF HER NEXT TO A PICTURE OF YOUR WIFE. >> I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICE PICTURE OF HEIDI. >> COME ON. >> I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE. SHE'S A PRETTY WOMAN. >> YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> EXCUSE ME, I DIDN'T START IT. >> SIR, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THAT'S THE ARGUMENT OF A 5-YEAR-OLD. >> I DIDN'T START IT. NO, IT'S NOT. >> THE ARGUMENT OF A 5-YEAR-OLD IS "HE STARTED IT." >> EXCUSE HE. YOU WOULD SAY THAT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH OUR COUNTRY. >> EVERY PARENT KNOWS A KID WHO SAYS "HE STARTED IT." >> EXCUSE ME. >> Stephen:  YEAH, EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME, ANDERSON. YOU WOULD SAY THAT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM, ANDERSON. BECAUSE, YEAH, TRUMP DOES ACT LIKE A 5-YEAR-OLD, AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE LIKE HIM. HE'S NOT COMPLICATED. IF HE'S ANGRY, HE SHOUTS. IF HE'S HAPPY, HE WEARS HIS HAPPY HAT. HE LOVES BUILDING TOWERS, AND HE THINKS GIRLS ARE KIND OF YUCKIE. BUT RIGHT NOW, EMOTIONAL IMMATURITY MAY BE THE LEAST OF TRUMP'S PROBLEMS. >> DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER UNDER FIRE TONIGHT, CHARGED WITH BATTERY. THAT MANAGER, COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP'S MOST TRUSTED ADVISER, NOW FACING A CRIMINAL CHARGE. >> LEWANDOWSKI WAS CHARGED IN FLORIDA WITH WHAT'S CALLED SIMPLE BATTERY FOR ALLEGEDLY GRABBING THE ARM OF A REPORTER. >> Stephen: NOW, LEWANDOWSKI AND TRUMP BOTH DENIED THAT HE EVER TOUCHED THE REPORTER, BUT YESTERDAY, FLORIDA POLICE RELEASED THIS SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE SHOWING THAT HE ACTUALLY DID. THIS IS A SHAMEFUL ACT THAT IS SURE TO DERAIL HIS CAMPAIGN AND TRUMP IS UP 10 POINT IN THE POLLS. ( LAUGHTER ) AND AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON HIS PLANE YESTERDAY, TRUMP INSISTED THAT HE WOULD STAND BY HIS MAN >> I KNOW IT WOULD BE VERY EASY FOR ME TO DISCARD PEOPLE. I DON'T DISCARD PEOPLE. >> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. HE NEVER DISCARDS ANYONE. EXCEPT HIS FIRST COUPLE WIVES ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, OF COURSE, THESE PEOPLE. >> GET HIM OUTTA HEEEERE! GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUTTA HERE. YEAH, THROW HIM OUT. THROW HIM OUT TO THE COLD. GET HIM OUT. OUT, OUT, OUT. BRETT YOU'RE FIRED. SINBAD YOU'RE FIRED. YOU KNOW WHAT, MEATLOAF. I'M GONNA MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY. GARY, YOU'RE FIRED. >> Stephen: LUCKILY, GETTING FIRED GAVE GARY BUSEY MORE TIME TO PURSUE HIS REAL PASSION, ARGUING WITH SQUIRRELS. ( LAUGHTER ) PLUS, PLUS, AS FAR AS TRUMP IS CONCERNED, TRUMP WAS THE ONE IN DANGER. >> SHE WAS GRABBING ME. AND JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND, SHE WAS OFF BASE BECAUSE SHE WENT THROUGH THE SECRET SERVICE. SHE HAD A PEN IN HER HAND, WHICH SECRET SERVICE IS NOT LIKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, WHETHER IT'S A LITTLE BOMB. >> Stephen: YES, HER PEN, HER PEN COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BOMB. AND HER FINGERS COULD HAVE BEEN A GUN. OR EVEN SIDSORS. OR SCISSORS. OR ROCK, OR PAPER, OR A DOG. WOOF, WOOF! OR EVEN WORSE, SHE COULD HAVE USED THAT PEN TO WRITE DOWN SOMETHING HE SAID! THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MUCH DAMAGE THAT COULD DO. NOW, WE INVITED DONALD TRUMP ON THE SHOW TO ADDRESS THIS CONTROVERSY. DID WE ACTUALLY DO THAT? DID WE INVITE HIM? OKAY, I'M GOING TO SAY WE INVITED DONALD TRUMP ON THE SHOW TO ADDRESS THIS CONTROVERSY, BUT HE WAS BUSY BEING ON EVERY OTHER CHANNEL ON TELEVISION. PLUS, I THINK HE'S TURNED INTO A CARTOONISH VERSION OF HIMSELF AT THIS POINT. SO INSTEAD, WE INVITED A SLIGHTLY LESS CARTOONISH VERSION. PLEASE WELCOME CARTOON DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, CARTOON DONALD TRUMP. >> THANK YOU STEPHEN. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. HE STARTED IT. >> Stephen: WAIT, WHO STARTED WHAT? >> ANYBODY, STEPHEN. WHATEVER THEY STARTED. UNLESS IT MAKES AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IN WHICH CASE, I STARTED IT. IT'S VERY EXCITING, THE BEST. >> Stephen: OKAY, NOW, MR. CARTOON TRUMP, HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO ANDERSON COOPER COMPARING YOU TO A 5-YEAR-OLD? >> ANDERSON COOPER IS A DUMB-DUMB. HE'S A STUPIDHEAD HE'S A TOTAL POOPY-PANTS. SAD. >> Stephen: OKAY, RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE SOUNDING A LITTLE IMMATURE. >> I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I? >> Stephen: OH COME ON. YOU SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT. >> STEPHEN, I'M RUBBER, YOU'RE GLUE. I HAVE A LAWYER, AND I WILL SUE. >> Stephen: WHAT ABOUT THE VIDEOTAPE? IT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER GRABBED A REPORTER ROUGHLY. >> NO, HE DIDN'T. >> Stephen: YES HE DID. >> NO, HE DIDN'T. >> Stephen: YES HE DID. >> NO, HE DIDN'T INFINITY. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: INFINITY? THAT'S IT? IT SETTLES IT. >> THAT SETTLES IT. IT TOTALLY SETTLES IT. I I SETTLED IT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. SHE STARTED IT. >> Stephen: HOW DID HE START IT? SHOOEFS HOLDING ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BOMBS? >> Stephen: LIKE THESE. >> GET IT AWAY, STEPHEN! >> Stephen: COME ON, COME ON, IT'S JUST A PEN. SEE, LOOK. >> NO! IT'S A BOMB! IT'S A BOMB! IT'S A BOMB. GET IT AWAY YOU SADISTIC BASTARD. GET IT AWAY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) STEPHEN, YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW MY FACE OFF. >> Stephen: OKAY, OKAY, I'LL PUT THE BOMB AWAY. >> OKAY, SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO MAKE PUTIN SAY. THAT'S THE ART OF THE DEAL. >> Stephen: BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT EVEN IF YOU GET THE NOMINATION, MR. TRUMP, ESPECIALLY AFTER THIS, YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE WITH WOMEN. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO APPEAL TO FEMALE VOTERS? >> WOMEN ARE EASY. JON, DROP A BEAT. ♪ HEY, LADIES. WELCOME TO LADIES NIGHT AT CLUB TRUMP. SNOW! COME GET SOME SUGAR. >> Stephen: CARTOON DONALD TRUMP EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ERIC STONESTREET. ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN EMMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR WHO STARS AS CAMERON TUCKER ON ABC'S "MODERN FAMILY." HIS LATEST PROJECT IS HBO'S "CONFIRMATION." PLEASE WELCOME ERIC STONESTREET! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> THANK YOU, SIR. >> Stephen: WE PLAY A LITTLE BATOAFEP FOR THE CLASSIER GUESTS AROUND HERE. VERY NICE. DID YOU STUDY DANCE? >> I WANT TO SAY YES, BUT MY ANSWER IS NO. >> Stephen: REALLY? YOU DO SEEM VERY GRACEFUL. >> THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! >> Stephen: YOU'RE FROM KANSAS CITY. >> I AM FROM KANSAS CITY. >> Stephen: GREAT TOWN, K.C., GREAT STEAKS. >> AMAZING STEAKS. THANK YOU-- CRAZY, I GREW UP GRILLING, YOU KNOW. >> Stephen: YUP. ONLY PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, KANSAS CITY. >> KANSAS CITY. >> Stephen: AMAZING. >> IT'S BREAKING NEWS RIGHT NOW. >> Stephen: NO, BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TOWN, BUT YOU LEFT THERE, I HEARD YOU WENT TO CHICAGO. >> DI. >> Stephen: TO DO, LIKE, IMPROV COMEDY THERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHERE I STARTED IN CHICAGO AT IMPROV COMEDY. DID WE OVERLAP AT ALL? >> WE DIDN'T CROSS PATHS OURSELVES -- >> I WAS AT THE SECOND CITY. >> YES, YOU WERE AT SECOND CITY, AND I WENT THERE ON A SPRING BREAK. ( LAUGHTER ) AND-- NOT EVEN FUNNY. >> Stephen: IT'S A LOVELY TOWN. CHICAGO IS ACTUALLY A VERY NICE TOWN. SPRING BREAK IS A LITTLE LATER IN CHICAGO. >> YES, BUT I WENT ON SPRING BREAK WITH SOME BUDDIES, AND WE SAW A SECOND CITY SHOW. AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS GREAT, IT WAS FANTASTIC. BUT THEN AS I GOT INTO ACTING, I WAS, LIKE, RESEARCHING. I WAS LIKE I WONDER IF I SAW ANYBODY FAMOUS IN THAT SHOW, YOU KNOW? I WONDER IF ANYBODY WENT ON AND DID ANYTHING? AND NO ONE HAD. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. NO, I SAW THIS GUY PERFORM ON THE STAGE WHEN I WAS JUST RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SO YOU WERE ON THE MAIN STAGE, AND YOU WERE IN THAT SHOW. >> Stephen: THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN. OF THAT A LOT OF FUN ( APPLAUSE ). >> YOU, NO DOUBT, HAD SOMETHING TO DO, YOU KNOW, WITH ME. I DIDN'T KNOW I WANTED TO BE AN ACTOR THEN. I DIDN'T FIGURE OUT I WANTED TOON AN ACTOR UNTIL I WAS A JUNIOR IN COLLEGE. >> Stephen: I HAD THE SAME SORT OF REACTION. I WENT THERE AND THOUGHT I WANT TO DO THAT. >> IT'S SO FUN. SO EXHILARATING. >> Stephen:  DID YOU DO IMPROV FOR A LONG TIME? >> DI. TINA FEY WAS ONE OF MY TEACHERS AT SECOND CITY. >> Stephen: AMAZING. >> YOU GUYS ARE GOOD CLAPPERS. >> Stephen: THEY ARE, VERY GOOD CLAPPERS. >> I LIKE-- YEAH. >> Stephen: I WAS BRIEFLY-- I WAS BRIEFLY TINA'S DIRECTOR FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS IN THE TOURING COMPANY THERE, AND I JUST REMEMBER SEEING HER GOING, "WHO IS THAT?" AND I PUT HER IN EVERY SCENE. >> YEAH, AMAZING. SECOND CITY HAS PUT OUT SUCH GREAT, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY PERFORMERS. I NEVER MADE IT TO THE STAGE. I WAS ONLY THERE TWO YEARS. AND I MOVED TO L.A. AND STUDIED AT IMPROV OLYMPIC. >> Stephen: DID ANYTHING WORK OUT FOR YOU? >> NO, I NEVER FOUND MY OWN GROOVE. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: WELL, ARE YOU IN A REALLY FASCINATING MOVIE, AN HBO MOVIE, CALLED "CONFIRMATION" WHICH IS ABOUT THE CLARENCE THOMAS CONFIRMATION. FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY BE TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER OR WHO-- A LITTLE CLOUDY. ( LAUGHTER ). >> ARE YOU OFF-- ARE YOU OFFERING? >> Stephen: NO, NO. I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO EDIT THAT OUT, THIS BEING CBS. >> BOOP! >> Stephen: TELL PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CONFIRMATIONS? WHAT WAS THE PARTICULAR STORY THERE? >> WELL, CLARENCE THOMAS WAS NOMINATED FOR THE SUPREME COURT THEN, AND HE WAS -- >> AND THEY DECIDED TO ACTUALLY HOLD HEARINGsING. THAT'S FASCINATING. >> YES, UNLIKE TODAY. >> Stephen: EXACTLY. >> YES, EXACTLY.  ( APPLAUSE ) THEY WERE HAVING HEARINGS, AND THEN A WOMAN NAMED ANITA HILL CAME FORTH AND SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE NEEDED-- WELL, SHE ACTUALLY DIDN'T COME FORWARD. SHE WAS INTERVIEWED, OR SOMEBODY REACHED OUT TO HER AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT AT ALL. SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE SAID. ONCE THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS STARTED SHE FELT LIKE SHE SHOULD AT LEAST TELL -- >> HE WORKED WITH CLARENCE THOMAS. >> AT AT THE E.E.O.C. AND SHE CAME FORWARD TO SAY HE SEXUALLY HARASSED HER IN THE WORKPLACE, AND THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER IS THE COKE CAN -- >> TO SPELL THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT, ONE OF THE AMAZING THINGS ABOUT THE HEARINGS, HERE ARE SENATORS, VERY DIGNIFIED PEOPLE-- >> WITH SOUTHERN ACCENT S. >> Stephen:  EXACTLY. AND JOE BIDEN, WHO WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT THE TIME, I BELIEVE. >> HE WAS. >> Stephen: ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT "NOW, YOU SAY HE CAME UP TO YOU AND SAID 'HEY, THERE'S A PUBIC HAIR ON MY COKE CAN'T." A GREAT PICKUP LINE. >> TOTALLY. >> Stephen: THEY WERE ALSO ASKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE PORN-- THAT'S YOURS, I PROMISE YOU. HOLD ON. >> THANK YOU. ( LAUGHTER ). >> WHAT'S A LITTLE-- YEAH. >> Stephen: BUT THEY WERE ALSO ASKING QUESTIONS IN SENATE HEARINGS ABOUT THINGS LIKE, "ARE YOU FAMILIAR ABOUT THE WORK OF A MAN NAMED LONG DONG SILVER." >> AND MY CHARACTER WHO WAS HIRED TO SHEPARD HIM THROUGH THE PROCESS -- >> HE HAD BEEN A REPUBLICAN CHIEF OF STAFF. >> HE WAS RONALD REAGAN'S CHIEF OF STAFF, STILL A VERY RESPECTED GUY IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THEY HIRED HIM TO KIND OF SHEPARD CLARENCE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND THERE'S A GREAT SCENE WHERE THEY JUST KEEP SANG LONG DONG SILVER. AND MY CHARACTER IS LIKE-- I CAN'T SAY THAT WORD ON TV. I ALMOST SAED A REALLY BAD WORD, BUT HE'S LIKE-- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF THAT. >> Stephen: WE CAN BLEEP IT. >> HE'S LIKE GOD-- I CAN'T SAY IT IN FRONT OF YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: BUT, BUT YOU'RE OKAY-- BUT YOU'RE OKAY SAYING LONG DONG SILVER? YEAH. >> Stephen: I HAVE NO IDEA IF WE CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT. I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A CLIP OF YOU TRYING TO TALK TO THE ACTOR PLAYING CLARENCE THOMAS THROUGH A PART OF THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS AND WHETHER HE SHOULD-- >> BASICALLY SIGN A SWORN STATEMENT SAYING HE DIDN'T SAY IT. THIS IS WENDAL PIERCE AND ME. >> IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME AS YOURS. EXCEPT INSTEAD OF REFUTING HER CLAIMS ONE BY ONE, LIKE YOU DID, WE THOUGHT IT MADE MORE SENSE TO OFFER A SINGLE, CATEGORICAL DENIAL? >> WHY? >> IT'S JUST US BEING EXTRA CAREFUL. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT AT SOME POINT SOMETHING WAS SAID BY YOU. >> SOME OFF-THE-CUFF COMMENT-- NOT INAPPROPRIATE, BUT WHICH SHOO TOOK TO BE INAPPROPRIATE. >> YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. >> NO, WE DO, WE DO. >> IF SOMETHING HAPPENED AND YOU SIGN ANYTHING ASSERTING THAT IT DIDN'T, IT'S A MISSTATEMENT OF SWORN FACT. IT'S GROUNDS FOR IMPEACHMENT. FORGET THE SUPREME COURT, CLARENCE. YOU COULD LOSE YOUR CURRENT JOB. >> I KNOW THAT, KEN. ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) >> Stephen: AND IT'S STILL-- IT'S STILL-- IT WAS NEVER SLELGTED WHETHER THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED OR NOT. DOES THE MOVIE COME DOWN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER? >> NO, THE MOVIE DOES A GREAT JOB OF LAYING OUT THE FACTS. IT'S TESTIMONY. IT'S INARGUABLE, SOME OF THE THINGS AND IT'S A DRAMATIZATION AT OTHER TIMES BECAUSE THERE OBVIOUSLY WEREN'T CAMERAS AND HOLLYWOOD WRITERS IN THE ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED SO YOU HAVE TO CREATE A STORY BUT SO MUCH OF IT IS ON THE RECORD. >> Stephen: SO YOU DON'T-- WHAT DO YOU THINK? ( LAUGHTER ) >> I THINK HE BELIEVES HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, AND I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE SHE WAS-- SHE FELT ASSAULTED IN SOME WAY AND HARASSED. AND SHE STARTED A NATIONAL CONVERSATION THAT WAS WORTHY, AND IT EMPOWERED A LOT OF WOMEN. >> Stephen: THAT'S HOW SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACTUALLY CAME INTO WORKPLACE VOCABULARY. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK RIGHT HERE, BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE ERIC STONESTREET, STICK AROUND. WE'RE BACK HERE WITH THE LOVELY ERIC STONESTREET. OBVIOUSLY, BESIDES HBO'S "CONFIRMATION," EVERYBODY LOVES YOU ON "MODERN FAMILY." >> THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: IT JUST GOT PICKED UP FOR A NINTH SEASON, IS THAT RIGHT? >> EIGHTH. >> Stephen: EIGHTH SEASON. GOING FOR NINTH. THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING PART. YOU KNOW, YOU PLAY A GAY CHARACTER. I UNDERSTAND MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED YOU OVER THE YEARS, AND YOU FIND SORT OF SURPRISING, THEY GO, "YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT PLAYING A GAY CHARACTER?" YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING REACTION TO THAT WHEN I LIKE. >> THE YEAR LEADING UP TO "MODERN FAMILY" I HAPPENED TO KILL THREE GIRLS ON NETWORK TELEVISION. >> Stephen: HOW, HOW? >> I STAND'D STABBED ONE. I DEEP FRIED ANOTHER ONE ON "PUSHING DAISIES." IT WAS A PROCEDURAL DRAMA, I WAS A BAD GUY. >> Stephen: YOU KEPT BEING CAST AS A MURDERRURE? >> YES, NO ONE ASKED ME, "WHAT'S IT LIKE PLAYING A MURDERER? ARE YOU OKAY BEING A MURDERER?" NOBODY SAID THAT. >> Stephen: WERE YOU AFRAID PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "THERE'S WANT MURDERER HAVING DINNER." >> I'M FROM KANSAS AND THEY WOULD SAY, WHAT, DO YOUR PARENTS THINK ABOUT YOU PLAYING A GAY GUY ON TV?" I SAID, "MY MOM'S HAPPY I'M NOT GETTING CAST KILLING PEOPLE ANYMORE." SHE'S HAPPY I'M MOVING ON FROM THAT. NOBODY ASKED, WHAT, DO YOUR PARENTS THINK THAT YOU GOUGED A GAL'S EYES OUT." I DON'T THINK WE TRY TO OVERSTATE WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY ON "MODERN FAMILY" BUT WE CAN'T DENY WE HAD PERSONAL IMPACT. A GIRL CAME UP TO ME AND SAID WHEN HER BROTHER CAME OUT TO HER PARENTS THE MOM ASKED, "WHICH ONE ARE YOU, MITCH OR CAM?" >> Stephen: THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS. >> A MITCH AND A CAM. OH, BOY. >> Stephen: AGAIN, YOU'RE FROM K.C. OPENING DAY IS THIS SUNDAY. >> YUP. >> Stephen: BUT YOU LIVE IN L.A. ARE YOU-- YOU PULL FOR THE DODGERS OR K.C., BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE TO PICK? >> NO, YOU REALLY -- >> NO, YOU OBVIOUSLY DO. >> NO. DAMN IT! NO, I DON'T. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRIVES ME INSANE THAT I'M FROM KANSAS CITY GROUP A ROYALS FAN MY WHOLE LIFE.  ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. MOVED TO L.A., PAY TAXES IN L.A., AND I'M THINKING I HAVE A LITTLE CASHOLA IN MY POCKET. WHY WOULDN'T I GET SEASON TICKETS. DODGER STADIUM IS 12 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE. >> Audience: DON'T MOVE! >> PEOPLE FROM KANSAS CITY AND PEOPLE FROM L.A. CAN'T UNDERSTAND I CAN ROUTE FOR BOTH TEAMS. IT'S THE AMERICAN TEAM AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE AND THE ONLY TIME IT'S IN CONFLICT IS WHEN THEY PLAY EACH OTHER IN THE WORLD SERIES, AND THEN I WOULD ROOT FOR KANSAS CITY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I'M FROM. OH, MY GOD, WHEN I GO ON TWITTER AND PEOPLE GIVE ME CRAP I BLOCK THEM, DONE. I POST A PICTURE OF ME IN A K.C.'S HAT. OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE A DODGER'S FAN. AND I POST A PICTURE OF MYSELF IN A DODGER HAT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE A ROYALS FAN. LEAVE ME ALONE! >> Stephen: DON'T YOU HAVE TO PICK? >> NO! >> Stephen: JUST BECAUSE THEY ONLY MEET IN THE WORLD SERIES IT'S LIKE SAYING, OBVIOUSLY, I'M MARRIED TO MY WIFE IN NEW YORK BUT SHE'S NOT MY WIFE IN CHICAGO. I HAVE A WIFE IN CHICAGO. >> NO. >> Stephen: AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM IF MY TWO WIVES MEET EACH OTHER. >> ALL RIGHT, THAT IS A FAIR ANALOGY. THAT IS A FAIR ANALOGY, BUT I CHOOSE TO BE A FAN OF BASEBALL. WHY CAN'T I JUST WATCH BASEBALL? >> Stephen: ME THINKS-- ME THINKS HE DOTH PROTEST TEACH. >> THAT'S ONE OF THE TWEETS I GET A LOT, TOO.

IF YOU LIKE A LITTLE JIGGLE TO YOUR MAN -- >> SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO, MORE TO LOVE? >> A LITTLE BIT OF BACK FAT. >> Stephen: THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR THAT. >> YES "THE DETOUR" PREMIERES APRIL 11 ON TBS AT 9 P.M. THE GREAT JASON JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK. >> THANK YOU. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. >> Stephen: ALWAYS GOOD TO TALK WITH YOU. YOU ARE SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THE THINGS YOU BELIEVE IN. THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER WAS IN SEPTEMBER. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION AT THE TIME THAT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MIGHT BE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. YOU MIGHT BE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY. BUT YOU DID NOT JUMP IN. ARE YOU SURPRISED HOW WELL BERNIE SANDERS HAS DONE IN HIS HEAD TO HEAD AGAINST SECRETARY CLINTON? >> LOOK, WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HURTIN OUT THERE AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD, WHO PLAY BY THE RULES, ARE HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME GETTING AHEAD. WASHINGTON IS NOT WORKING FOR THEM. AND I THINK BERNIE SANDERS GETS OUT THERE AND MAKES THAT CASE. I THINK HILLARY CLINTON GETS OUT THERE AND MAKES THAT CASE. AND I'M GLAD TO SEE IT.  ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: NOW, BERNIE SANDERS IS CALLING FOR A REVOLUTION. HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT CALLING FOR A REVOLUTION. SHE BELIEVES THAT SLOW AND STEADY KIND OF CHANGES THE D.C. THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GET FROM HER. WHAT ONE APPEALS TO YOU MORE, ELIZABETH WARREN. >> LOOK, LOOK, LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I REALLY LOVE SEEING. DEMOCRATS ARE OUT THERE FIGHTING OVER THE THINGS THAT AFFECT AMERICA'S FAMILIES. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, 70% OF YOUNG POEM TODAY HAVE GOT TO BORROW MONEY IN ORDER TO GO TO COLLEGE. SO BETWEEN SECRETARY CLINTON AND SENATOR SANDERS, THEY'RE TALKING TALKING ABOUT SHOULD IT BE FREE COLLEGE OR DEBT-FREE COLLEGE. GOD BLESS. THAT IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS SO MANY PEOPLE-- SO MANY PEOPLE WANTED YOU TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE A COMBO PLATTER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVEN THE THINGS YOU'RE SAYING. YOU'RE KIND OF A COMBO PLATTER OF THE-- OF HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS. YOU'RE LIKE VULTRON CANDIDATE. YOU'RE LIKE A COMBINATION. DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD JUMPED IN AND BEEN PART OF THE MIX HERE? >> LOOK, EVERY SINGLE DAY I GET OUT THERE AND DO WHAT THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS SENT ME TO DO. I'M FIGHTING FOR WORKING FAMILIES. I'M FIGHTING TO HOLD PEOPLE'S FEET TO THE FIRE. I'M FIGHTING FOR MORE COPS ON WALL STREET. I'M FIGHTING FOR OUR STUDENT. I'M FIGHTING FOR OUR SENIORS. GOD, THIS IS A FABULOUS JOB. WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE. I'M HAVING FUN. >> Stephen: YOU SAY YOU WANT MORE COPS ON WALL STREET. >> YUP. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE SOME THINGS IN COMMON WITH THE LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. AND I'LL MOVE MY PEN AWAY FROM YOU SO IT DOESN'T SCARE YOU. BOTH OF YOU FEEL THE GUYS ON WALL STREET ARE GETTING AWAY WITH STUFF THEY SHOULDN'T. HE WANTS TO TAX THE HEDGE FUND GUYS. HE THINKS THEY'RE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER. ISN'T THERE SOME UNITY THERE BETWEEN YOU AND DONALD TRUMP? >> LET'S BE REAL CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP IS LOOKING OUT FOR EXACTLY ONE GUY, AND THAT GUY'S NAME IS DONALD TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S-- THAT'S THE DEAL. SO, LOOK, HE SMELLS THAT THERE'S CHANGE IN THE AIR. AND WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THAT CHANGE WORKS REALLY, REALLY WELL FOR DONALD TRUMP. >> Stephen: HE SAYS HE'S WON HIS WHOLE LIFE. HE WINS, WINS, WINS. BUT NOW HE WANTS TO WIN FOR AMERICA. WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH, WE'RE GOING TO GET TIRED FOR WINNING. WHY DON'T YOU WANT-- WHY DON'T YOU WANT US TO WIN? ( LAUGHTER ). >> THIS IS THE DEAL. YOU GOTTA KIND OF LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER AT-- AT DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE THIS IS HIS MAIN CLAIM TO HOW IT IS THAT HE SAYS HE'S QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> Stephen: HE'S A WINNER. >> HE SAYS IN BUSINESS HE WINS, WINS, WINS. WELL, THE TRUTH IS, HE INHERITED A FORTUNE FROM HIS FATHER. >> Stephen: A SMALL MILLION-DOLLAR LOAN. >> YEAH, RIGHT. >> Stephen: A SMALL MILLION-DOLLAR LOAN. >> HE INHERITED A FORTUNE FROM HIS FATHER. HE KEPT IT GOING BY CHEATING AND DEFRAUDING PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THEN HE-- THROUGH CHAPTER 11. >> Stephen: HE NEVER BROKE THE LAW. HE'S NEVER BROKEN THE LAW. HE'S MERELY TAKEN ADVANTAGES-- >> GOT CAUGHT. >> Stephen: LISTEN, WE DON'T KNOW. >> THAT'S HIS MOVE. >> Stephen: REMEMBER, RUBBER, BLEW, HE'S GOT A LAWYER AND HE'LL SUE. HE'LL COME AFTER YOU. >> RIGHT. BUT, LOOK, THAT REALLY IS THE HEART OF IT, THAT DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT THERE'S CHANGE, AND THE QUESTION IS SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FROM THAT? WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT'S IN REAL TROUBLE. BUT WHEN THE ECONOMY IS IN THIS KIND OF TROUBLE, CAWG ON DONALD TRUMP FOR HELP IS LIKE IF YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE, CALLING AN ARSONIST TO COME HELP OUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DONALD TRUMP IS PART OF THE PEOPLE THAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE HAD A FLAME WAR-- SPEAK OF ARSON-- WITH DONALD TRUMP. YOU HAVE TWEETED A FEW THINGS. YOU'VE GONE ON THE WAR PATH. YOU'VE TWEETED, "LET'S BE HONEST, @REAL DONALD TRUMP IS A LOSER. COUNT ALL HIS FAILED BUSINESSES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AREN'T YOU-- BUT SOME WOULD SAY WHY GET DOWN-- WHY ARE YOU GETTING DOWN IN THE SCHOOL YARD WITH DONALD TRUMP? ISN'T THIS JUST NAME CALLING? >> OH, LOOK, COME ON. THIS ISN'T NAME CALLING. THIS IS TAKING THE CREDENTIAL THAT HE CLAIMS HE'S RUNNING ON, AND THAT IS HIS BUSINESS SUCCESS AND SAYING NO, BUSTER. WE'RE NOT BUYING THAT. HE IS NOT A BUSINESS SUCCESS. HE IS A BUSINESS LOSER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: HE'S A RICH GUY. HE'S STILL A RICH GUY. HE'S STILL A RICH GUY. >> YOU INHERIT THAT KIND OF FORTUNE FROM HIS FATHER -- >> HE DIDN'T GET $10 BILLION FROM HIS FATHER. >> YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE ANALYSTS SAID, IF ALL THE MONEY HE INHERITED FROM HIS DAD HE PUT IN INDEX FUNDS HE WOULD BE AS RICH AS HE WAS TODAY. HE WASN'T OUT THERE DOING FABULOUS DEALS. HE STARTED OUT RICH. HE CHEATED HIS WAY TO GETTING RICHER. THAT IS NOT GOING TO BUILD AN AMERICA FOR HARDWORKING PEOPLE. HE'S GOING TO LEAVE THEM IN THE DIRT LIKE HE'S LEFT EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE DIRT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT A NEW EDITION OF YOUR BIOGRAPHY "A FIGHTING CHANCE," WITH A NEW AFTERWARD HERE. IT'S A GREAT BOOK. BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO ENDORSE, HILLARY OR BERNIE? AND FEEL FREE TO GIVE ME A VARIETY OF NONANSWERS. WHO ARE YOU GOING FOR, HILLARY OR BERNIE? >> LOOK, RIGHT NOW, THE-- RIGHT NOW -- >> OH, BOY. >> THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING-- WE'RE OUT TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT HARDWORKING FAMILIES. STUDENT LOANS, SOCIAL SECURITY, MORE COPS ON WALL STREET, TRADE. >> Stephen: IF HILLARY DOESN'T GET IT, SHOULD HILLARY PEOPLE VOTE FOR BERNIE? AND IF BERNIE DOESN'T GET IT, SHOULD BERNIE PEOPLE VOTE FOR HILLARY. >> TOTALLY YES, BOTH WAYS. >> Stephen: BOTH WALES. >> BOTH WAYS, YOU BET. >> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. "A FIGHTING CHANCE," SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I WANT TO THANK ALL MY GUESTS. ESPECIALLY CARTOON DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> GREAT TO BE HERE, STEPHEN. IT WAS AN HONOR FOR YOU. >> Stephen: IT WAS SUCH A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU. A LITTLE SUGAR, BABY. >> OH, SWEET. SORRY. >> Stephen: TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE SARAH PAULSON FROM "THE PEOPLE VERSUS O.J. SIMPSON," STAR OF "ORPHAN BLACK", TATIANA MASLANY,  AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY WYNTON MARSALIS, LIL BUCK, AND JARED GRIMES. JAMES CORDEN IS UP NEXT. GOOD NIGHT!
