♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME TO THE LATE SHOW STARRING STEPHEN COLBERT, I'M HE. IF YOU ARE TUNING IN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME LET ME CATCH YOU UP WITH THE SHOW SO FAR. I STARTED HOSTING A FEW WEEKS AGO. AND YOU'RE ALL CAUGHT UP. NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THIS, YOU PROBABLY KNEW THIS, JON, BECAUSE ARE YOU AN ARTIST, YOU WRITE YOUR OWN LYRICS. IT'S NATIONAL POETRY DAY. SO I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ALL FANS OF POETRY OUT THERE EVERYWHERE, OKAY. AND SPEAKING OF POETRY, I ALSO WANT TO GIVE MAJOR RESPECT TO THE MAN FROM NANTUCKET. ALL RIGHT? YOU KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, SIR. I WOULD HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW BUT I KNOW YOU DON'T LEAVE THE HOUSE MUCH. (LAUGHTER) WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. I WILL BE TALKING TO ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS CATE BLANCHET. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOVELY. SHE STARS IN THE NEW MOVIE "TRUTH" WHERE SHE PLAYS A CBS EMPLOYEE WHO GETS FIRED AND WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD. (LAUGHTER) I WILL TALK WITH C.E.O. OF AIRBNB BRIAN CHESKY. BUT IF -- IF THE LANDLORD ASKS, HE'S MY COUSIN AND HE'S JUST VISITING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH. OH, DID YOU-- DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT SOUND? I HOPE SO, BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE A TERRIBLE TIME FOR ME TO START HALLUCINATING. THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN, EVERYBODY. SAY HELLO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BEFORE WE SURRENDER OUR BODY AND SOUL TO THE MUSIC, ONE MORE THING. BOB DYLAN HAS DONE A COMMERCIAL WITH IBM SUPERCOMPUTER WATSON AND INCREDIBLY WATSON WAS ABLE TO DECRYPT ALMOST EVERY WORD HE SANG. TONIGHT STEPHEN WELCOMES CATE BLANCHET, AIRBNB CHEE BRIAN CHESKY AND DARTMOUTH ROBOTICS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WHOA! THAT SOUNDED GOOD. THAT SOUNDED GOOD. THAT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU GUYS FEELING WOOD? EVERYBODY DOING ALL RIGHT TONIGHT? ME TOO, I GOT TO SAY I'M FEELING LUCKY AND GRATEFUL TO BE ALIVE. I'M COUNTING MY BLESSINGS. I'M UP TO FOUR AND A THUMB. BUT YOU KNOW WHO REALLY HAD A ROUGH DAY? THOSE FOLKS OVER AT E-BIBLE FELLOWSHIP. THEY'RE A CHURCH GROUP IN PENNSYLVANIA THAT PREDICTS THE END OF THE WORLD AND NOT AS THEIR NAME WOULD SUGGEST A BOOK CLUB THAT READS THE BIBLE ONLY ON KINDLE. THESE FOLKS GOT FAMOUS A FEW YEARS BACK FOR PREDICTING THAT JUDGEMENT DAY WOULD FALL ON MAY 21st, 201 -- YOU PROBABLY SAW THOSE SAVE THE DATE BILLBOARDS. I RSVPED IMMEDIATELY AND REQUESTED THE VEGETARIAN OPTION AT THE APOCALYPSE. WELL, IT TUSHES OUT THEIR MATH WAS A LITTLE OFF. I THINK THEY FORGOT TO CARRY ONE OF THE HEARSTMEN. BUT THEY TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THE BOOK OF REVELATION RECENTLY, CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS THROUGH THEIR JESUS CALL COUP LATER AND DISCOVERED THAT IN FACT THE PLANET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERMANENTLY DESTROYED YESTERDAY, OCTOBER 7th. AND SPOILER ALERT, (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYWAY, I HAVE SOME SYMPATHY FOR THOSE GUYS. I'M SURE THEY FEEL TERRIBLE TODAY. PROBABLY FOR A LOT OF REASONS. CUZ YOU KNOW THAT ONE THING YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IF THE WORLD WAS GOING TO COME TO AN END? THEY PROBABLY DID THAT LAST NIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE AWKWARD AT WORK TODAY. HEY, BRENDA. SO I'M SENDING THE FOLKS AT E-BIBLE FELLOWSHIP THIS SYMPATHY CARD. IT SAYS MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES FOR EVERYTHING STILL EXISTING. BUT YOU DID BELIEVE E-BIBLE FELLOWSHIP YOU CAN'T BE TOO SURPRISED. THOUGH THEIR PAMPHLET SAYS THAT OCTOBER 7th, 2015 WILL BE THE END. WORLD, THEY HEDGE THEIR BET BY ADDING THERE IS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD. STRONG LIKELY HOOD T MIGHT HAPPEN. BUT IF IT DOESN'T, IT IS NOT LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD. SO THEY GOT IT WRONG. BUT TO BE FAIR, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY THOUGHT THE END OF THE WORLD WAS COMINGMENT BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE SIGN OF THE APOCALYPSE LAST NIGHT, THE CUBS WON A PLAY-OFF GAME. THE CUBS HAVE WON A PLAY-OFF GAME. >> OVERNIGHT THE CHICAGO CUBS SNAPPING THEIR LOSING STREAK IN EPIC FASHION WINNING THEIR FIRST LAYOFF BUSINESS BALL GAME IN A DOZEN YEARS FANS TAKING TO THE STREETS IN CELEBRATION. >> Stephen: WHOOO!, THAT'S RIGHT, THE CUBS ARE HEADED TO THE NATIONAL LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES. CUBS FANS WERE SO EXCITED THEY RAN THAT YOU THE STREETS AN WHEN THEY HORDE THE TEAM WON, THEY CONTINUED TO DO SO AND FOLKS. THIS IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL FOR ME. SURE I LOVE NEW YORK BUT I LIVED IN CHICAGO FOR ELEVEN YEARS. CHEERS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: AND THE WINDY CITY WILL ALWAYS BE PART OF ME. SPECIFICALLY MY LOWER INTEST INTHAT IS SILL PACKED WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SAUSAGE. AND THE DIVISION SERIES IS IMPORTANT. IT'S LIKE THE WORLD SERIES OF THINGS THAT EVENTUALLY MIGHT LEAD TO THE WORLD SERIES. WHICH MEANS THE CUBS ARE STILL IN CONTENTION IT HAS BEEN 107 YEARS SINCE THE CUBS WON THE WORLD SERIES. TO PUT THAT IN PERFECT-- PERSPECTIVE, BACK THEN THE SONG WENT ♪ TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME ♪ ♪ TAKE ME OUT TO, I'VE GOT CHOLERA. (LAUGHTER) THEY ADDED THE CRACKER JACKS LATER. WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT CURED CHOLERA. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, LAST NIGHT'S VICTORY MATE MEAN THE CUBS HAVE FINALLY ESCAPED THE CURSE OF THE BILLY GOAT. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW, THE CURSE OF THE BILLY GOAT BEGAN IN 1945 WHEN A TAVERN OWNER BROUGHT HIS GOAT TO WRIGLEY FIELD FOR THE WORLD SERIES BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS GOATS LOVE BASEBALL. AND WHEN THEY WERE THROWN OUT, THE MAN DECLARED, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO WIN THE WORLD SERIES AGAIN! BECAUSE YOU INSULTED MY GOAT. AND EVER SINCE THEN, THE CUBS HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE CURSE OF THE GOAT, AS WELL AS THE CURSES OF BAD MANAGEMENT AND UNWILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR GOOD PLAYERS. IN FACT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN FACT, THE CURSE IS SO LEDGE ONLYARY THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO IN ORDER TO REVERSE THE CURSE, A TEAM OF COMPETITIVE EATERS ATE A 40 POUND GOAT. SOMEHOW STILL MORE HEALTHY THAN EATING BALLPARK NACHOS. BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE DAYS OF THE CURSE ARE BEHIND MY CUBS. SURE, TECHNICALLY THEY STILL NEED TO WIN 11 MORE GAMES OVER THE COURSE OF THREE MORE BEST HAD SERIES BUT I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF JINXESING, THEY'RE GOING ALL THE WAY. THE CUBS ARE GOING TO WIN THE WORLD SERIES. YEAH. I GUARANTEE IT! I GUARANTEE IT. I AM NOT SCARED OF YOU KNUCKLE KNEEED SHEEP WANNA-BES ANY MORE. THAT FEELS GOOD. SO MANY THINGS I'VE WANTED TO SAY ABOUT YOUR KIND FOR YEARS. BUT I'VE BEEN TOO SCARED BECAUSE OF THE CURSE. NOT ANY MORE. FIRST OFF, YOUR CHEESE SUCKS, OKAY. YOU CAN GET THE SAME FLAVOR BY LEAVING A BRICK OF PHILADELPHIA CREAM CHEESE TO DRY OUT. SECONDLY, NICE BEARD, SOUL PATCHES WENT OUT IN THE '70s. OH, THAT BURN HAS GOT TO FEEL PRETTY BAAAAAD. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, GOATS? CURSE THE CUBS AGAIN? I DARE YOU. THE CUBS ARE UNSTOPABLE. I'VE EVEN ALREADY GOT MY 2015 CUBS WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP SHIRT ALL PRINTED UP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WHOOO! LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE CUBBIES. WHOOO! WHOOO! THAT GUY ISN'T CELEBRATING. WHO IS THAT GUY NOT CELEBRATING? (LAUGHTER) KICK HIM OUT OF HERE. YOU KICK HIM OUT OF HERE. I DON'T CARE IF HE HAS A TICKET. YOU GET OUT OF HERE, RIGHT NOW! NO, NO, YOU GET OUT. GOOD RIDDANCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THIS DECISION CAN COME BACK TO HAUNT ME OR THE CUBS. AFTER ALL, THE CHICAGO CUBS ARE CLEARLY THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME! LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE CUBS. GOATS, GOATS, GOATS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. GOATS, GOATS, GOATS! >> THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY AT&T, DIRECTV AND AT&T ARE NOW ONE, PUTTING TELEVISION AND WIRELESS TOGETHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: HEY. FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW YOU KNOW I'M A BIT OF A TECH GEEK, I DON'T WANT TO BRAG AM BUT MY CAR HAS BOTH AM AND FM. THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED TO LAUNCH MY BRAND-NEW GADGET CELEBRATING SEGMENT TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO CALL IT TECH TALK. AND WE PLAN AN OPENING GRAPHIC WITH SOME AMAZING 3D LIKE NANOBOTTS EXPLODING OFF THE SCREEN AND THEN FORMING THE WORDS TECH TALK AND THEN THE TECH TALK THAN O BOTTS EXPLODE AND BECOME TINY NANOBOTTS WHICH FORM MY FACE THAT FORM THE WORDS TECH TALK. LIKE NOTHING ANYBODY WOULD EVER SEE AND THEY NEVER WILL BECAUSE WE THOUGHT OF IT AT 12:00 TODAY AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO MAKE IT. SO INSTEAD THIS IS TRUE, I LOOKED AROUND MY OFFICE AND I NOTICED THAT I OWN A DIDGERIDOO-- DIDGERIDOO. SO WE DECIDED TO CALL IT DIGITAL DOO. IT'S A RICH AND PERSONAL INSTRUMENT. FIRST UP, ON DIGITAL DOO, WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY. NOT I DON'T LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT MY GOOGLE GLASS, MY APPLE WATCH AND TWO NINTENDO POWER GLOVES. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU MIGHT BE ATTACKED BY AN 8-BILL MIKE TYSON. SO I'M ALWAYSING FOR NEW WAYS TO PUT COMPUTERS ON MY BODY. WHICH IS WHY MY WIFI WAS ON FULL BARS WHEN I HEARD THAT GOOGLE AN LEVIES ARE NOW COLLABORATING TO MAKE SMARTPANTS. ABOUT TIME, MY OLD DUMB PANTS CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER MY WASTE SIZE. IT'S 32 YOU IDIOT. YOU'RE STRANGLING ME. (LAUGHTER) I CAN'T FEEL MY BUTT. APPARENTLY GOOGLE IS DEVELOPING A NEW DIGITAL TYPE OF FABRIC THAT YOU CAN TOUCH AND IT CAN FEEL IT AND IT ALSO BLUETOOTHS YOUR PHONE. SO NOW YOU CAN SWIPE THE SIDE OF YOUR JEANS TO MUTE YOUR PHONE, EVEN TAP THE FABRIC FOR PLAYING ANY SONG. WHICH MEANS PRETTY SOON ALL YOUR CALLS CAN BE BUTT DIALS. AND THANKS TO THE NEW GOOGLE SMARTPANTS, YOU WON'T HAVE TO REACH ALL THE WAY TO YOUR POCKET TO USE YOUR PHONE. YOU COULD JUST SWIPE THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR POCKET, FITTING SEVERAL PRECIOUS SECONDS PER DAY. AND THAT'S TIME YOU COULD SPEND EXPLAINING TO THE POLICE WHY YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR CROTCH IN PUBLIC. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NEXT UP ON DIGITAL DOO, IT MIGHT BE HARD TO BELIEVE BUT I'M OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE CHILDREN, THAT I KNOW OF. (LAUGHTER) AND ANY PARENT WILL TELL YOU THAT TEENAGERS THESE DAYS ARE MASTERS OF TECH. BUT THERE IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL HELP PARENTS MASTER THE TEEN. >> A NEW LINE OF CARS COULD PLAY TATTLE TALE ON TEEN DRIVERS. GENERAL MOTORS WILL INSTALL AN OPTIONAL SYSTEM IN SOME 2016 CHEVY MALIBU MODELS THAT WILL COMPILE IN TOUCH SCREEN REPORT CARD FOR PARENTS. IT KEEPS TRACK OF HOW FAR YOUR TEEN DROVE AND THEIR TOP SPEED. >> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT. SOON GM CARS WILL HAVE A NEW WAY TO LET PARENTS KNOW HOW THEIR TEENS ARE DRIVING. AND IT'S MUCH SAFER THAN THE OLD WAY, TEXTING YOUR TEEN WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING. THE TECHNOLOGY IS CALLED TEEN DRIVER. IT'S AVAILABLE ONLY IN THE 2016 CHEVY MALIBU AND PARENTS, IT'S FULLY SCALEABLE TO YOUR EXACT INABILITY TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. FOR INSTANCE, IT CAN SOUND AN ALERT WHEN TEENS DRIVE FASTER THAN A SPEED LIMIT PREDETERMINED BY THE PARENTS. AS FOR WHAT THAT SOUND ALERT SHOULD BE, I RECOMMEND A PRAYERIE HOME COMPANION. BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TEEN TO JOYRIDE WHILE LISTENING TO AN ELDERLY MAN REMINISCE ABOUT RHUBARB PIE. AND THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY COMPILES DATA ON HOW MANY TIMES TEEN PASS THOSE LIMITS AND MAKES THAT DATA ACCESSIBLE TO ANY PARENT WITH A PIN NUMBER. WHICH IS A GREAT SECURITY FEATURE AFTER YOUR TEEN TEACHES YOU HOW TO USE IT. TEEN DRIVER ALSO PREVENTS KIDS FROM BUMPING THEIR JAMS BY DISABLING THE VEHICLE'S AUDIO SYSTEM WHEN THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGERS AREN'T BUCKLED. THOUGH ONCE YOU ARE BUCKLED, THE MUSIC'S BAGGING. BUT YOU'RE STILL IN A CHEVY MALIBU. IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET SO COOL. NEXT UP, (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SELFIES. THEY'RE FUN. THEY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THEY ELIMINATE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING TO ASK YOUR ROOMMATE TO TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR JUNK. BUT SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR TYPES OF SELFIES ARE PEOPLE DOING SOMETHING DANGEROUS LIKE POSING WITH BEARS OR RUNNING WITH BULLS. AND AS FUN AS THAT LOOKS, NOT ALL THOSE PHOTOS END WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO MEN DIED IN RUSSIA WHILE TAKING A SELFIE HOLDING A HAND GRENADE WITH THE PIN PULLED. THE MOBILE PHONE WITH THE SELFIE SURVIVED AS A RECORD. SO FIRST OF ALL THAT'S A TRAGEDY. SECOND OF ALL, WHAT KIND OF PHONE CASE WERE THEY USING? BECAUSE IT MUST BE PRETTY GOOD. NOW SURE, THE GRENADE PROBABLY HOLDS SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITY HERE. BUT LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF ONE CLEAR FACT. SELFIES ARE KILLING PEOPLE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO PANIC YOU. >> I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THE NEWS. >> DEATH BY SELFIE. >> A DISTURBING TREND HERE, SELFIES KILLING PEOPLE. THEY KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN SHARKS OVER A 12 MONTH PERIOD. >> THERE HAVE BEEN 12 SELFIE RELATED DEATHS VERSUS 8 REPORTED SHARK FATALLITIES. >> Stephen: OKAY, THAT WAS A LOT OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION TO DIGEST. I AM REALLY GLAD THEY MADE THIS CHART. (LAUGHTER) LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH-- LET ME WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE DATA. LET ME CRUNCH IT FOR YOU. THAT IS THE NUMBER 12. THAT IS THE NUMBER 8. AND UP HERE, THAT LINE IS 20. NOW I JUST WANT TO WARN-- I WANT TO WARN MY VIEWERS OUT THERE, YOU ARE TAKING TOO MANY SELFIES, DON'T DO IT, IT'S JUST TOO DANGEROUS. ALSO STOP GETTING ATTACKED BY SO MANY SHARKS. IT ISN'T SAFE. THOUGH IF YOU ARE GETTING ATTACKED BY A SHARK, BY ALL MEANS, TAKE A SELFIE. CUZ MAN, YOUR INSTAGRAM IS GOING TO BLOW UP. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CATE BLANCHETT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN THE NEW FILM "TRUTH" PLAYING A CBS NEWS PRODUCER WHOSE CONTROVERSIAL REPORT ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S MILITARY SERVICE ENED HER AND DAN RATHER'S CAREERS. >> HOW LONG HAVE WE KNOWN EACH OTHER? >> IS IT THAT BAD? >> THEY'RE GOING TO START AN INVESTIGATION. AND CBS WANTS TO APPOINT AN INDEPENDENT PANEL TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THE STORY IS PUT TOGETHER. AND I'M GOING TO ANNOUNCE IT. TOMORROW. I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE STORY ON AIR. >> ANDREW ASKED YOU TO APOLOGIZE? >> HE DIDN'T ASK,. >> DAN, THAT'S SURRENDER. >> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME THE GREAT CATE BLANCHETT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT CERTAIN AID ME WITH THE DIDGERIDOO AS A MATING CALL. >> Stephen: ARE YOU AUSTRALIAN, DO YOU PLAY DIDGERIDOO. >> I DID, I ALSO PLAYED THE BAGPIPE, THE SPOONS, THAT IS REALLY HARD. >> Stephen: I'M ACTUALLY MAKING A SOUND. >> IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT. THAT IS REALLY HARD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> ARE YOU TRULY. >> Stephen: I'M DOING IT. I'M DOING IT. THE THING IS YOU LOOK REALLY ATTRACTIVE WHILE YOU DO IT. >> NO, YOU DON'T. >> Stephen: NO, YOU REALLY DO, VERY MANLY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I HAVE TO SAY, THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO I ACTUALLY GET STARSTRUCK BY AND YOU ARE ONE. >> NOT ONE OF THEM. >> Stephen: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THEM. YOU ARE SUCH AN AMAZING ACT RES. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: A GOLDEN GLOBE, TWO TIME ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACKER KNOWN FOR SUCH FILLS AS LIDS BETH, LORD OF THE RING, NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT, THE AVIATOR, BLUE JASMINE, YOUR LATEST FILM IS "TRUTH" WHERE YOU PLAY MARY-- THE PRODUCER THAT DAN RATHER WAS USING WHEN HE REPORTED ON PRESIDENT BUSH SUPPOSEDLY HAVING GONE AWOL WHEN HE WAS SERVING IN THE ALABAMA NATIONAL GUARD. >> DURING THE VIETNAM WAR. >> Stephen: THAT REALLY BLEW UP TELEVISION NEWS. >> IT DID. I MEAN, THE QUESTION MARK OF THE BUSH'S SERVICE IN THE GUARD HAD LONG BEEN SOCIALIZED, NOT ONLY IN TEXAS WHERE MARY WAS BASED. HE DESCRIBES TEXAS AS THE INTERGAL AC PARTICULAR -- INTERGALACTIC CAPITOL [BLEEP] OF -- >>. >> I DID MANY TIMES, IT HAS BEEN QUITE CATHARTIC FOR HER AND FOR DAN. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CHASING THE STORY. AND I WONDER WHETHER A STORY LIKE THAT COULD EVEN GET AS FAR AS IT DID, YOU KNOW. CUZ I'M NOT FROM YOUR GREAT NATION. AND I-- BUT YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY -- >> YOU ARE AUSTRALIAN. >> HE THINK OF YOU AS ENGLISH BECAUSE OF ALL THE PARTS BUT YOU ARE ACTUALLY AUSTRALIAN. >> I AM PART ELF. >> Stephen: I WANT TO THANK AUSTRALIAN FOR GIVING JOURNALISM RUPERT MURDOCH. >> YOU CAN HAVE HIM BACK. HE HAS BECOME ONE OF YOURS. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: I PLAYED-- I PRETENDED TO BE SOMEONE IN JOURNALISM FOR MANY YEARS. >> YOU ALSO PRETENDED TO BE HALF DWARFISH AND HALF HOBBIT, WHERE WE FIRST MET AT COMIC CON. THAT IS THE MAN GOING TAKE OVER THE LATE SHOW. >> Stephen: I'M ACTUALLY HAVEL OFISH BECAUSE ONE OF MAY EARS IS STICKS OUT. >> ONE LOBE IS ATTACHED AND ONE IS DETACHED. >> Stephen: YES. I'M GETTING OVER THE FACT THAT YOU JUST TOUCHED MY EAR LOBE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHECK THE REST OF ME FOR SYMMETRY? I CAN DO A-- CAN I SHOW YOU THE TRICK-- THIS IS A GOOD TRICK. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK, THIS IS MAGIC. LOOK, WATCH, READY, THIS ISN'T THE TRICK YET. >> WHEN, YOU FART AND IT POPS OUT? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: NOTHING SO CRUDE. NOTHING SO CRUDE. >> IS THAT HOW YOU SEDUCED YOUR WIFE? >> THAT IS EXACTLY -- >> YOU PUT THE RING IN THERE. >> Stephen: THAT IS MY PICKUP LINE. >> YEAH. >> IT WORKED ONCE. >> Stephen: YES, EXACTLY. THERE IS A SCENE IN THE MOVIE WHERE MARY HAS SOFT-- THE STORY IS BLOWING UP IN HER FACE A LITTLE BIT. THE PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING THE VERACITY OF THESE DOCUMENTS. AND SHE GOES ON-LINE AND STARTS READING LIKE BLOG POSTS OR COMMENTS ON NEWS STORIES. DON'T EVER DO THAT, NO. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE HER REACTION WHEN SHE GOT TURNED INTO A POLITICAL CUDGEL. SUDDENLY SHE WAS THE STORY AN SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT. >> YEAH, SHE SPENT HER ENTIRE CAREER BEHIND THE CAMERA, PRODUCING STORIES. >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> AND LISTENING TO INFORMATION AND FOLLOWING LEADS AND SUDDENLY SHE WAS THE STORY. AND I THINK THAT THERE MUST-- BOTH SHE AND DAN HAD A VERY WELL HONED SENSE OF SORT OF TRYING TO COMBAT INJUSTICES, YOU KNOW, THAT IS PART OF-- YOU KNOW T IS THEIR IDEALISTIC JOURNALISTS AND THERE ARE STILL A FEW ALIVE, I THINK. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A POLITICAL CUDGEL, HAS ANYBODY EVER USED YOU TO BEAT SOMEBODY OVER THE HEAD. I HAVE HAD IT HAPPEN A COUPLE OF TIMES, IT'S DELICIOUS. >> DO YOU WANT TO DO IT TO ME. >> Stephen: NO, NOT AT ALL. HAVE YOU EVER FIND THEM DISSEMINATING FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. >> I'M AN ACKER. AND YOU EXPECT, THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO LIKE WHAT YOU DO AND LOATHE WHAT YOU DO. BUT I MEAN I THINK WHENEVER AN ACTOR STEPS INTO WHAT CAN BE SEEN TO BE POLITICAL, WHICH IS USUALLY AROUND THE ISSUES OF CLIMATE CHANGE, LET'S FACE IT, YOU KNOW -- >> IT IS NOT IN. >> NO, NO. >> Stephen: IT COULDN'T BE IN UNTIL IT'S SUBMERGED. >> YEAH, NO. BUT I THINK WHENEVER YOU STEP, YOU CROSS OVER A LINE AND SUDDENLY YOU BECOME A CELEBRITY AND SOMEONE WHO HAS ZERO INTELLIGENCE AND SUDDENLY YOUR HAIR COLOR MATTERS. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO JUST KEEP GOING. AND PART OF, I DON'T THINK ONE JOB AS AN ACKER IS, I AM NOT INTERESTED IN GETTING ON A SOAPBOX WITH MY WORK. BUT YOU'RE ALSO A CITIZEN. AND A MEMBER OF SOCIETY. >> Stephen: ARE YOU A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES? >> I AM, ACTUALLY. >> Stephen: ARE YOU? >> I AM, MY DAD IS FROM TEXAS. >> Stephen: CON GRADLATIONS. >> OH, THANK YOU. >> Stephen: SEE HOW MUCH MORE YOU LIKE ME NOW. NO, WE LOVE YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. >> THANK YOU. IS THAT SINCERE. >> Stephen: NO, ABSOLUTELY. NO, NO, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU. I'M ACTUALLY BANKING DOWN MY FEELINGS OF JOY THAT YOU ARE HERE. I REALLY AM AN ENORMOUS FAN. >> OH, THANK YOU. >> Stephen: THE SCANDAL WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. >> THAT WAS A GREAT BOOK AND A GREAT SCREENPLAY. >> Stephen: JUDI DENCH IN THAT, IT WAS BOTH OF YOU, YOU ESPECIALLY ARE JUST BARELY, BARELY KEEPING YOUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER IN THAT ENTIRE MOVE-YEAR. >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: BUT YOU SEEM TO BE LIKE THE QUEEN OF THAT, SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST BARELY KEEPING IT TOGETHER AT ALL TIMES. LIKE MARY MAPEE HAS TO KEEP HER [BLEEP] TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME, A LITTLE XANAX, A LITTLE WHITE WINE. >> I SUBSCRIBE TO A SIMILAR COCKTAIL. >> Stephen: COULD I TRY SOMETHING WITH YOU. I WAS GOING TO LET YOU GO BUT I HAVE AN IDEA I WOULD LIKE TO TRY. >> SURE. >> Stephen: AND THAT IS, AS YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BARELY KEEPING THEIR [BLEEP] TOGETHER IN PERFORMANCE, I'VE GOT A SCRIPT. I'VE GOT A SCRIPT THAT I MADE, THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO PERFORM WITH YOU. >> OKAY. >> Stephen: LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT THIS IS. I SAW THIS, WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A HAMILTON BEACH SINGLE SERVE BLENDER ON AMAZON. >> DID YOU FIND SAID -- >> I DID, I FOUND IT. ON THE PAGE IT ACTUALLY HAD A LITTLE, A QUESTION AND ANSWER THING WHERE IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT, YOU COULD ASK QUESTIONS OF SOMEBODY WHAT ALREADY BOUGHT IT ON AMAZON. AND THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED ALL THE QUESTIONS REALLY SEEMED LIKE THEY COULD BARELY KEEP THEIR [BLEEP] TOGETHER. AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A FUN THING TO SEE CATE BLANCHETT TAKE A CHANCE AT ACTING OUT. REMEMBER YOU ARE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BLENDER. >> THE BIG PRINT. >> Stephen: I'M THE QUESTIONS, YOU ARE THE ANSWERS DOWN HERE. >> OKAY. >> Stephen: REMEMBER, ARE YOU JUST KEEPING IT TOGETHER. >> OKAY. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. SO HAMILTON BEECH SINGLE SERVE BLENDER WITH TRAVEL LID, AMAZON QUESTION AND ANSWER. CATE, IS IT A GOOD BLENDER? >> IT'S BASICALLY A TINNY KITCHEN BLENER WITH A PULSE BLEND BUTTON AND NO OTHER SPEED SETTINGS. THE MICKER JAR WORKS LIKE THE BLENDER, THE MOER SCREAMS LIKE A DYING GERBIL AND IT SPINS TO MIX YOUR STUFF. >> Stephen: IS IT EASY TO CLEAN? >> YOU JUST USE SOAP AND WATER. THE LID HAS GOT A LOT OF GROOVES AN CRANNIES BUT IT CLEANS UP PRETTY WELL. >> Stephen: BUT DOES IT WORK WELL? >> AS TO FUNCTIONALITY AS FAR AS THIS UNIT GOES, IT'S FINE. THE MIXING ACTION IS QUITE GOOD AND THE LID STAYS TIGHTLY ON THE JAR, I MOSTLY USED IT FOR LIGHT POWDER MIXES, NOTHING HEAVY, IT COULD PROBABLY HANDLE FRUIT CHUNKS, IT'S FAR FROM A POWERHOUSE. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY BUILT THIS PRODUCT EXPRESSLY FOR THE PRODUCT OF CREATING LIQUID DRINKS TO TAKE OUT OF, AND MAKE THE CONTAINER LEAKEY. I MEAN IF YOU WERE USING THIS SYSTEM TO MAKE DRINKS TO TAKE WITH YOU FOR LUNCH OR WORK OUT LATER IN THE DAY, YOU ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO SPEND YOUR ENTIRE DAY WORRIES ABOUT LEAKING AND REMEMBER TO HOLD THE CONTAINER CARSLY UPRIGHT WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF MAKING THINGS EASIER FOR YOU. THAT PERSON IS IN FREE FORM. OH DEAR. THAT IS REALLY -- >> SO THAT'S A YES. WELL, CATE BLANCHETT, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LET ME PLAY YOU OUT AS YOU GO, ALL RIGHT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, "TRUTH" OPENS IN SELECT THEATERS OCTOBER 16th. NATIONWIDE OCTOBER 30th. THE GREAT KAILT BLANCHETT, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU, CATE. THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CO-FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF AIRBNB. PLEASE WELCOME BRIAN CHESSSKI. THANKS FOR COMING. ARE YOU STAYING IN AN AIRBNB HERE IN NEW YORK? >> YES, I AM STAYING IN ONE IN SOHO. >> Stephen: IS IT NICE. >> REALLY NICE. >> Stephen: DID YOU PERSON KNOW IT WAS YOU WHEN HE BOOKED YOU. >> I THINK HE DID. MOST I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW BECAUSE I WANT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE BUT THE WHOLE THING IS YOU GET TO VIRTUALLY PLEAT WOM PEOPLE WHEN YOU STAY THERE. >> Stephen: HOW DUE VIRTUALLY-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I NEVER DID IT BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD FREAK OUT PEOPLE. >> THE WAY IT WORKS IS EVERYONE HAS A PROFILE. YOU GET TO VERIFY YOUR IDENTITY. SO YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE. AND THE WHOLE THING WORKS, IF YOU WERE TO STAY IN MY PLACE, YOU WOULD BOOK WITH ME, ALL PAYMENTS HAPPEN THROUGH THE WEB SITE AND AFTER THE STAY, YOU LEAVE ME A REVIEW. AND THEN I LEAVE YOU A REVIEW. WE HAVE HAD MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LEAVE REVIEWS. THE WHOLE THING WORKS ON THE REPUTATION SYSTEM. >> Stephen: HOW OLD IS IT? >> HE STARTED IN 2008, ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD. >> Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THIS TAKING OFF IS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WAS CRATERING IN 2008 AND PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD WHERE TO STAY, IS THAT WHY YOU STARTED IT. >> NO, THE REASON-- WELL, THAT'S A RELATED POINT. IT STARTED BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH MY ROOMMATE JOE. I COULDN'T AFFORD TO MAKE RENT. THIS ONE WEEKEND, THIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WAS COMING TO SAN FRANCISCO. THESE HOTELS ARE SOLD OUT. SO THEY NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY. JOE AND I THINK WHAT IF WE COULD CREATE A BED N BREAKFAST FOR THIS CONFERENCE. UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BEDS BUT JOE HAD THREE AIR BEDS. WE PULLED THE AIR BEDS OUT OF THE CLOSET, INFLATED THEM AND CALLED THE AIR BED N BREAKFAST. AND THAT IS HOW IT STARTED. >> Stephen: THAT IS WHAT AIRBNB MEANS. >> THAT IS WHAT AIRBNB MEANS. >> WOW. >> SO THAT, IT STARTED THAT WEEKEND. >> IT STARTED THAT WEEKEND AND IT STARTED GROWING. YOU KNOW, THEN WE REALIZED WE'RE ODE GUYS, ODE PEOPLE LIKE US WANT TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY, AND MEET COOL PEOPLE. WE SAID WHAT IF WE COULD BUILD A WEB SITE WHERE YOU COULD BOOK SOMEONE'S HOME THE WAY YOU COULD BOOK A HOTEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND ALMOST 2 MILLION HOMES LATER AND 24,000 CITIES YOU HAVE WHAT IT IS TODAY. >> Stephen: DO YOU CALL YOURSELF, ARE YOU-- CUZ THE HOTEL PEOPLE WOULD CALL YOU OR BUSINESSPEOPLE WOULD CALL YOU LIKE A DISRUPTER. THE IBMER BUY WAS HERE AND HE DIDN'T MIND THE DISRUPTER LABEL. ARE YOU OKAY WITH DISRUPTER. >> HI THAT LABEL GROWING UP FROM THE TEACHERS AND THAT WAS NEVER A GOOD THING. I GOT ME IN THE PRINCIPALS OFFICE. SO I THINK WE'RE A GOOD THING. I THINK THAT WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD. I MEAN NEW YORK CITY, PARIS, THESE CITIES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COULD NEVER AFFORD TO VISIT THESE CITIES AND I THINK WE OPEN MANY CITIES UP WHERE PEOPLE COULDN'T HAVE TRAVELED BEFORE. >> Stephen: BUT IT IS NOT TIED TO THE ECONOMY AT ALL? BECAUSE -- >> CERTAINLY DURING THE GREAT RECESSION, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE VERGE OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. AND THE BEST THING WHEN YOU ON THE VERGE OF LOSING YOUR HOME IS ACTUALLY SHARING THE RENT OF IT. SO IF YOU COULD SHARE THE SPACE. >> Stephen: IT IS A AN OLD MODEL LIKE DURING THE DEPRESSION. >> WE HAD BORDERS COME INTO THEIR HOUSE. >> WE DIDN'T INVENT THE IDEA OF A BOARDING HOUSE, SO YEAH, WE HAVE GOTTEN SINCE THEN THOUSANDS OF LETTERS FROM HOSTS SAYING THANK YOU, YOU KNOW. YOU HELPED ME SAVE MY HOME. WE HAVE DONE SURVEYS AND IT TURNS OUT THAT HALF OF OUR HOSTS, DEPEND ON AIRBNB TO PAY THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE. IT IS A BIG DEAL FOR THEM. >> Stephen: SOMEBODY IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD A HOUSE SITTER WHILE THEY WENT OFF TO UNBEING MAN. WHILE THEY ARE AT BURNING MAN SOMEBODY BURNING OUT THEIR HOUSE TO AIRBNB TO MAKE SOME MONEY WHILE THEY WERE GONE. >> YES. >> Stephen: IS IT SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO BURNING MAN? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT. >> I MEAN THE THING IS THAT WE HAVE HAD-- THAT IS AN EXTREMELY RARE EXPERIENCE. WE DO HAVE 24/7 CUSTOMER SUPPORT, SO IF YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN CALL US. WE HAVE HAD 60 MILLION PEOPLE USE US. TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. IT'S PRETTY CRAZY. I SITE THAT STARTED TO RENT OUT AIR BEDS THIS PAST SUMMER, WE HAD ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN A SINGLE NIGHT STAYING IN A HOME. AND THOSE PEOPLE CAME FROM 180 COUNTRIES. >> Stephen: AT ANY ONE NIGHT THERE WERE A MILLION PEOPLE. >> A MILLION PEOPLE IN A HOME AND THOSE MILLION PEOPLE CAME FROM 180 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. >> Stephen: WHAT IS THE PRICE RANGE. >> I MEAN ANYTHING FROM LIKE $50 BUCKS A NIGHT YOU CAN STAY IN 50 BUCKS A NIGHT IN SAVANNAH CUBA TO 5, $10,000 A NIGHT -- >>. >> Stephen: IN CUBA NOWNESS WAS IT HARD TO SELL A COMMUNIST COUNTRY ON THE IDEA OF SHARING? >> IT WAS-- WELL --. >> Stephen: JUST NOW. >> LIKE A FEW MONTHS AGO. >> Stephen: WHERE AREN'T YOU? THE WORLD? >> NORTH KOREA. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. >> IRAN AND SYRIA. >> Stephen: WOW. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: ARE YOU PUSHING HARD OR JUST -- >> WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON CUBA FOR NOW. WE HAVE 2,500 HOMES THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE INVENTED IN CUBAMENT IT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 20 YEARS IN CUBA. THEY ARE A VERY ENTREPRENEUR COUNTRY. >> Stephen: ARE YOU A BILLIONAIRE. >> SO THEY SAY. (LAUGHTER) LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. >> I DON'T KNOW. I GET THESE STATEMENTS IN THE MAIL AM ALL THESE ZEROES, WHO CAN EVEN COUNT THEM AT THIS POINT. >> MY PARENTS ARE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> AND ALL THEY EVER WANTED FOR ME GROWING UP WAS TO GET A JOB. THEY SAID IF YOU GET A JOB YOU HAVE TO PROMISE THAT THAT JOB HAS HEALTH INSURANCE THAT IS ALL THEY EVER WANTED. THEY WERE SOCIAL WORKERS. >> Stephen: DO YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. >> I DO. I MADE SURE TO GET MYSELF HEALTH INSURANCE. >> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. BRIAN CHESSSKI IS THE C.E.O. OF AIRBNB. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, MY NEXT GUESTS ARE THE TEAM BEHIND DARTMOUTH ROBOTIC MVP PROJECT. PLEASE WELCOME COACH BUDDY TEEVENS AND ELLIOTT KASTNER, COACH, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ELLIOTT, GREAT TO SIGH. >> GREAT TO BE HERE. >> Stephen: HOW IS DARTMOUTH DOING THIS YEAR. >> 3 AND 0, OFF TO A GREAT START. >> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT WITHIN OF THE REASONS THEY ARE DOING SO WELL AM YOU HAVE A UNIQUE WAY OF PRACTICING YOUR TACKLES. TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DEVELOPEDDING TO. WHAT IS THE MVP. >> A MOBILE TACKLING DEVICE, WE DON'T TACKLE EACH OTHER, A GUY WILL NEVER TACKLE ANOTHER FOOTBALL PLAYER AM WITH SIMULATED PADS AND THIS ROBOTIC DUMBY. >> Stephen: IT IS A DUMBY THAT ACTUALLY RUNS, IT COMES DOWN THE FIELD AND MEMBERS OF THE TEAM TACKLE IT RATHER THAN EACH OTHER. WHY DON'T YOU WANT THEM TO TACKLE EACH OTHER. DOESN'T IT TOUGHEN YOU UP? DON'T YOU HAVE TO WANT IT. DON'T HAVE YOU TO DIG DOWN, DON'T YOU NEED TO HUNKER DOWN, DON'T YOU NEED TO GIVE 110%, DON'T YOU NEED TO LEAVE IT ALL OUT ON THE FIELD, COACH. AM I BEING TOO TECHNICAL. >> WHY NOT TACKLE EACH OTHER. THAT IS WHAT FOOTBALL IS. >> CONCUSSIVE HEAD INJURIES. >> OKAY. >> HUGE CONCERN. AND WE CAN ELIMINATE A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THEM. WE DROPPED 80% INJURY REDUCTION JUST GOING TO A NONTACKLE SITUATION. >> Stephen: BECAUSE THOSE WERE HAPPENING IN PRACTICE? >> EXACTLY IN PRACTICE. >> Stephen: WOW, WOW. >> MOST CONCUSSIONS OCCUR IF PRACTICE, MORE SO THAN IN GAMES. >> YOU PLAYED FOR THE TEAM, RIGHT. >> I PLAYED FOR FIVE YEARS UNDER KEEP TEEVENS. >> Stephen: DID YOU TACKLE EACH OTHER THEN. >> NO, NO, BUT WE STILL SMASHED HEADS HERE AND THERE. >> Stephen: YOU WORKED ON CREATING THIS ROBOT. WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION. >> TWO YEARS AGO THE COACH APPROACHED THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AT DARTMOUTH AND A GROUP OF FOUR ENGINEERS AND FACULTY PICKED IT UP AND STARTED THE BALL ROLLING FROM THERE. NOW WE ARE HERE WITH A DUMMY ON THE FIELD THAT WE ARE USING AND WE ARE SEEING THE BENEFITS OF IT AT PRACTICE. >> Stephen: IS IT ONLY DARTMOUTH USING THE ROBOT. >> ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND. >> Stephen: ANYBODY ELSE INTERESTED IN USING YOUR DUMMY? >> WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND A NUMBER OF PRO TEAMS CALL US, WOULD LOVE TO GET IT ON BOARD. >> Stephen: YOU BUILT A ROBOT THAT CAN PLAY FOOTBALL. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD BUILD ONE THAT COULD WATCH BASEBALL? (LAUGHTER) >> PRETTY EASILY, PROBABLY. >> Stephen: THE GAMES ARE SO LONG. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR OTHER SPORTS OR JUST FOOTBALL. >> I THINK WE HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY SOCCER PEOPLE, LACROSSE PEOPLE, ICE HOCKEY. ANY MOVEMENT SPORT. RUGBY IS HUGE. >> Stephen: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDSING TO FOR DARTMOUTH MOUTH'S MVP ROBOTIC TACKLING DUMMY. HIT IT. >> Stephen: DOES THE ROBOT ALWAYS SHOWBOAT LIKE THAT? >> HE MIGHT GET PENALIZED FOR THAT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, HOWARD HARD IS IT? THAT'S SOFT, MAN. THAT IS HUGGABLY PLUSH. DO YOU EVER PUT A HEAD ON IT. >> WE HAVEN'T YET. WE'RE DEVELOPING THAT. >> Stephen: HOW ABOUT THE OPPOSING TEAM'S JERSEY ON IT, SOMETHING TO GET PEOPLE FIRED ON. >> ON OCCASION, YES. >> Stephen: WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I ATTEMPTED TO TACKLE IT? >> LOVE TO SEE YOU DO IT. >> Stephen: GIVE IT A SHOT RIGHT HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> AND THERE'S NO SENSE IN DOING THIS TO MAKE THE PLAYER SOFT IN ANY WAY. THIS ISN'T PART OF THE WOOSIFICATION OF THE AMERICAN SPORT SAPP? >> NO, WE'RE MAKING THEM SMARTER. >> ALL RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: CAN'T IMAGINE, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT I WILL EVER REGRET WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO. HIT WITH YOUR SHOULDER. >> Stephen: YOU GUYS STAYING AT AN AIRBNB WILE YOU'RE HERE. >> Stephen: KEEP YOUR. >> KEEP YOUR EYES UP. >> Stephen: NOT GOING TO ANSWER THAT ONE. ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T WE HAVE THAT GUY GO OUT THERE AND I WILL TAKE A SHOT AT IT. HAVE HIM GO OUT THERE. COME BACK AT ME WITH SOME SPEED. ALL RIGHT. >> WHILE COACH AND EVERYBODY OUT THERE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I PLAYED ONE DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> I'M FINE. I'M FINE. BUDDY TEEVENS, ELLIOTT KASTNER, FROM DARTMOUTH ROBOTIC MVP. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE LATE SHOW, EVERYBODY. TUNE IN TOMORROW, MY GUEST WILL BE THE HOST OF THE LATE LATE SHOW JAMES CORDEN, C.E.O. OF SHANE SMITH AND PERFORMANCE BY HALSEY. NOW STICK AROUND FOR THE GUY I'VE GOT TOMORROW NIGHT.
