Stephen: HEY! THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. LOOK AT YOU! LOOK AT YOU!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE "LATE SHOW"." WOOO! ♪ ♪ ♪
Stephen: THANK YOU! PLEASE, EVERYBODY, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY. THE RUMORS ARE TRUE, I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AS YOU KNOW-- AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, IT'S ALREADY FALL OF 2015, AND WE'RE COUNTING DOWN UNTIL THAT MAJOR EVENT THAT IS EVERY AMERICAN'S CIVIC DUTY TO TAKE PART IN: THE NEW "STAR WARS" MOVIE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LAST WEEK, WE WERE OFF, WE WEREN'T DOING THE SO I COULDN'T TALK ABOUT THE BRAND NEW TRAILER. AND THIS WAS NOT A TEN-SECOND SLOW-FADE TEASER, NONE OF THAT B.S. THIS WAS A REAL TRAILER WITH ACTUAL CHUNKS OF MOVIE FLAVOR CRYSTALS IN IT! I WAS DEEPLY MOVED. FIRST OF ALL, SEEING THE MILLENIUM FALCON AGAIN GAVE ME A COMBINATION OF WEEPING AND GIGGLING THAT I CALL "GEEPLING," WHICH I BELIEVE IS ALSO THE NAME OF ONE OF THE NEW "STAR WARS" CHARACTER. AND HOW GREAT TO SEE CHEWBACCA REUNITED WITH HAN SOLO'S GRANDFATHER. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. ( LAUGHTER ) SOME OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS-- I'M GOING TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING-- J.J. ABRAMS AND I ARE GOOD FRIENDS, BUT HE HAS TOLD ME NOTHING-- INCLUDING WHAT J.J. STANDS FOR OR WHAT HIS PHONE NUMBER IS. VERY FRIENDS. BUT AS THE ORIGINAL "STAR WARS" FAN, RIGHT HERE, FROM JUST SEEING THIS TRAILER, I AM CONFIDENT, I HAVE THE DEFINITIVE GUESS AS TO THE ENTIRE PLOT OF THE MOVIE. HERE WE GO. IT'S BEEN THREE DECADES SINCE THE EVENTS OF THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY, THE DARK AND MYSTERIOUS FIRST ORDER HAS STEPPED INTO THE POWER VACUUM ONCE HELD BY THE EMPIRE, AND THE NEWLY NAMED RESISTANCE FIGHTS IN PLACE OF THE REBEL ALLIANCE, WHICH HAS BEGUN A TRAGIC SHIFT TO THE DARK SIDE. BUT JOHN BOYEGA'S CHARACTER IS IN A STORMTROOPER SUIT, SO IT FOLLOWS THAT NOW, THE "NEW" NEW HOPE COMES FROM THE VERY ENEMY WE'VE BEEN TRAINED TO HATE! REMEMBER, THE DARK SIDE WAS NEVER EXPLICITLY TIED TO THE EMPIRE. THE FORCE ITSELF EXISTS OUTSIDE OF MERE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY STRUCTURES. SO I PREDICT THAT DARK BECOMES LIGHT AND LIGHT BECOMES DARK, THE VERY FABRIC OF THE FORCE IS STRETCHED TO ITS LIMIT AS A NEW GENERATION EMERGES TO TEAR DOWN THE FALSE DISTINCTIONS OF THE PAST AND UNITE US ALL, OLD AND NEW, MOISTURE FARMERS AND NERF HERDERS, STAR AND WARS, ONCE AND FOR ALL BRINGING PEACE TO THE GALAXY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YES! YES, INDEED. YES, INDEED.
Stephen:  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS NOW I'VE SPOILED THE MOVIE FOR MIGHT FEEL, AND I REALLY WANTED TO SEE IT. LUCKILY, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. FROM "THE GOOD WIFE," I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH JULIANNA MARGULIES. SHE IS FANTASTIC, LOVELY, TALENTED. EXCELLENT COMPANY. EARLIER THIS YEAR, SHE GOT HER STAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME. THAT'S REALLY EXCITING TO SEE FOR THE ONE GUY IN HOLLYWOOD WHO STILL WALKS. AND WE'VE GOT BEST-SELLING AUTHOR JONATHAN FRANZEN. ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVING AUTHORS TODAY. FRANZEN IS A GREAT NOVELIST. HE DOES NOT LIKE TWITTER, AND IF YOU DON'T EITHER, SHOW YOUR SUPPORT WITH THE HASHTAG #IMWITHFRANZEN. THEN WE WILL HAVE MUSIC FROM ALABAMA SHAKES. OUR DEAR FRIEND. OUR GOOD FRIEND. THEIR NEW ALBUM IS CALLED "SOUND & COLOR," AND I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SINCE I WAS A BABY. IF THEY DANGLE A SET OF SHINY KEYS, I'M GOOD FOR THE EVENING. ( BAND PLAYING ) OH, DO YOU HEAR THAT? THAT'S THE SOULFUL SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE ABOUT TO MAKE US EAR-PREGNANT WITH A GROOVE-BABY. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: SCIENTISTS WORKING ON A CURE FOR BALDNESS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REGROWN HAIR ON LAB RATS. SO GREAT NEWS, BALD MEN. NOW YOU CAN WEAR A RAT ON YOUR HEAD. (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  )
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES JULIANNA MARGUILIES. AUTHOR JONATHAN FRANZEN. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY ALABAMA SHAKES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY! HEY!
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ?IERKS STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! HEY, THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANKS, THANKS JON, THANKS TO THE BAND. THANKS EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENERGY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR JOY. LIKE A LOT OF NEW YORKERS I AM A LITTLE TIRED AND PISSED OFF THIS MORNING. BUT THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN. I'M GUESSING A LOT OF YOU FLIPPED OVER FROM THE THIRD REPUBLICAN DEBATE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YET BECAUSE WE TAPED THIS AT 5:30, BUT I AM SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE BRAND NEW REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER, RETIRED NEUROSURGEON AND CURRENT TIRED PERSON, BEN CARSON. IT'S BEEN A GREAT TIME FOR HIM. THIS SURGEON IS SURGING IN THE TOLLS BET 26% OF VOTERS AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP'S 22%. THE OTHER 52%, OF COURSE, IS GOING TO THE OTHER 52 CANDIDATES. NOW, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THAT IS. CARSON'S STRONGEST SUPPORT COMES FROM EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS A GROUP THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD REAL TROUBLE WITH, EVIDENTLY. PEOPLE WHO READ THE BIBLE JUST DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW SOMEONE WHO LOOKS THAT MUCH LIKE A GOLDEN CAWFL. ( LAUGHTER ) WHILE TRUMP HAS SPENT MONTHS TURNING OFF VOTERS WITH LOUD, OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS, CARSON'S OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN VERY QUIET.
OBAMACARE REALLY I THINK IS THE WORST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS NATION SINCE SLAVERY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO PRISON STRAIGHT AND WHEN THEY COME OUT THEY'RE GAY.
SO, WHAT IS THE-- WHAT IS THE POINT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE? IF THERE HAD BEEN GUNS IN GERMANY, THERE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A HOLOCAUST?
I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF HITLER BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HIS GOALS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED IF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN ARMED.
Stephen: WELL, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH HIS LOGIC. THESE DAYS, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GUNS, AND WHERE'S HITLER? DEAD. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW THAT HE'S LOST THE LEAD, DONALD TRUMP HAS STARTED QUESTIONING CARSON'S RELIGION, SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISM.
I'M PRESBYTERIAN. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? BOY, THAT'S DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, FOLKS, IN ALL FAIRNESS. I MEAN, SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST I DON'T KNOW ABOUT. I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
Stephen: NOW SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS WAS AN ATTACK, PARTLY BECAUSE EVERYTHING TRUMP SAYS IS AN ATTACK, BUT TRUMP CLARIFIED. HE SAID HE WASN'T ATTACKING SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISM.
I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR RELIGION. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT IT. I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
Stephen: I'LL TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AN ATTACK. IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN YOUR AUNT HAS A COUPLE OF COCKTAILS AT THANKSGIVING AND SAYS, "I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE JEWS." SHE PROBABLY MEANS, SHE PROBABLY MEANS: "I HAVE A DEEP CURIOSITY ABOUT THEIR RELIGION AND AM VERY EAGER TO LEARN. I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT THEM." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL SEE YOU AT THANKSGIVING, AUNT RITA. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT DONALD DID OPENLY ATTACK BEN CARSON ON SOMETHING HE HOLDS FAR MORE SACRED THAN SOMEONE'S RELIGION: THEIR LEVEL OF PEP.
BEN CARSON IS SUPER-LOW ENERGY, RIGHT? SUPER, HE'S SUPER LOW. SUPER LOW-ENERGY! WE NEED TREMENDOUS ENERGY!
Stephen: YES, EXHIBITING TREMENDOUS ENERGY IS THE NUMBER ONE REQUIREMENT FOR BEING PRESIDENT. WHO CAN FORGET ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S GETTYSBURG WORKOUT TAPE, "THE ABSOLITIONIST OF STEEL." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT-- LOOK AT THOSE STOVEPIPE SHORTS. I THINK HE IS SMUGGLING SOMETHING IN HIS UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. HE'S THE RAIL SPLITTER. BUT CARSON, CARSON DIDN'T TAKE TRUMP'S INSULT LYING DOWN. HE SAT HALFWAY UP AND SAID THIS:
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE HAVE MISTAKEN YOUR SOFTSPOKENNESS WITH A LACK OF ENERGY?
I WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE THAT. AS A TEENAGER, I WOULD GO AFTER PEOPLE WITH ROCKS AND BRICKS AND BASEBALL BATS AND HAMMERS. AND, OF COURSE, MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE STORY WHEN I WAS 14 AND I TRIED TO STAB SOMEONE. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: SURE, SURE, 14. THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR STABBING PRIME. WHEN I WAS 14, I WAS ON MY HIGH SCHOOL STABBING TEAM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. I MEAN, HE'S A NEURON SURGEON. HE MANAGED TO HARNESS HIS YOUTHFUL PASSION FOR STABBING PEOPLE IN THE STOMACH INTO SOMETHING MORE POSITIVE: STABBING PEOPLE IN THE BRAIN. DONALD TRUMP BETTER WATCH HIMSELF BECAUSE IF HE COMES AFTER BEN CARSON, THE GOOD DOCTOR WILL WRITE HIM A PRESCRIPTION FOR 10 CCs OF VITAMIN KNIFE. STICK AROUND, WE HAVE JULIANNA MARGUILIES AND ALABAMA SHAKES. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: MAN! I AM EXHAUSTED. LOOK, I GOT THE FRUSTRATED HAIR. I AM EXHAUSTED JUST LISTENING TO THAT. THAT IS BEAUTIFUL, YOU ALL. WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, WE TAPE EARLY THE SHOW SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH TONIGHT'S REPUBLICAN DEBATE YET. BUT I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE FACE-OFF BETWEEN THE PARTY'S BIGGEST OPPONENTS: CARSON AND STAYING AWAKE. CARSON HAS RECENTLY PULLED AHEAD OF DONALD TRUMP, MAKING IT THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY A WHITE MALE BILLIONAIRE IS THE UNDERDOG. BUT TRUMP RECENTLY EXPLAINED HE'S BEEN AN UNDERDOG HIS WHOLE LIFE: MY WHOLE LIFE HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR ME. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR ME. AND I STARTED OFF IN BROOKLYN. MY FATHER GAVE ME A SMALL LOAN OF A MILLION DOLLARS. ( LAUGHTER ) I CAME INTO MANHATTAN, AND I HAD TO PAY HIM BACK, AND I HAD TO PAY HIM BACK WITH INTEREST.
Stephen: YOU HEARD RIGHT. DONALD TRUMP CALLS A MILLION DOLLARS "A SMALL LOAN." BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS THE SAME GUY WHO THINKS THREE IS A SMALL NUMBER OF WIVES. SO MATT LAUER TRIED TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE.
LET'S JUST PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. YOU SAID IT HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR YOU, BUT "MY DAD GIVE ME A $1 MILLION LOAN."
NO, HE DID.
THAT PROBABLY IS GOING TO SEEM PRETTY EASY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.
YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT $1 MILLION ISN'T VERY MUCH COMPARED TO WHAT I BUILT.
Stephen: YES, THESE DAYS, HE'S WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FOR HIM, A MILLION DOLLARS IS GARBAGE. SO LET ME TAKE A MOMENT HERE TO SAY: "MR. TRUMP, YOU LOOK LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CLEARLY-- CLEARLY, THIS IS AN INSPIRING TALE OF A YOUNG MAN MADE GOOD, A CLASSIC STORY OF RICHES TO RICHER. DONALD WAS JUST A HUMBLE BOY FROM THE OUTER BOROUGHS, AND HE WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO ESCAPE THAT PROVINCIAL LIFE AND MAKE HIS WAY IN THE BIG CITY. BUT HIS OLD MAN STOOD IN HIS WAY, SAYING, "YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO MANHATTAN. THAT'S NOT OUR TERRITORY." BUT DONALD DARED TO HEAD OUT INTO A LAND HE DIDN'T ALREADY OWN, MOVING FROM QUEENS TO MANHATTAN, LEAVING HIS FAMILY BLOCKS BEHIND. THE YOUNG DONALD TOOK PASSAGE ACROSS THE STORMY SEAS OF THE EAST RIVER WITH NOTHING MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN HIS POCKET AND THE SHIRT ON HIS BACK. THE OTHER SHIRTS WERE STILL AT THE TAILOR. AND LIKE SO MANY IMMIGRANTS BEFORE HIM, WHEN HE CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GLIMMERING BEACON OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY, HE THOUGHT, "EH, SHE'S A SIX, MAYBE A SEVEN IF SHE HAD A BIGGER RACK." ( LAUGHTER ) CLASSY, THOUGH. NICE CAN. AND THROUGH HARD WORK, PERSEVERANCE AND AN ACCOUNTANT WELL VERSED IN BANKRUPTCY LOOPHOLES, HE BECAME THE GREAT, MAGNANIMOUS BILLIONAIRE WE KNOW TODAY, A MAN WHO'S PROUD TO SAY THAT TO HIM A MILLION DOLLARS IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT I HAVE TAKEN THE LIB IT TEE OF WRITING A MILLION DOLLAR CHECK FROM DONALD TRUMP TO THE CHARITY OF MY CHOICE, THE HARLEM CHILDREN'S ZONE. IT'S ALL FILLED OUT. IT'S ALL FILLED OUT, EVEN THE MEMO LINE, "NO BIG DEAL." NOW, MR. TRUMP, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS COME HERE AND SIGN IT, PROVING THAT $1 MILLION REALLY IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S HELPING ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ESPECIALLY-- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S HELPING OTHER PEOPLE GET A START IN MANHATTAN. WHO KNOWS, THE KIDS YOU HELP MIGHT ONE DAY BE SO RICH, THEY CAN BLOW THEIR CASH ON A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JULIANNA MARGULIES.

Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A THREE-TIME EMMY AWARD WINNER AND STAR OF THE HIT SHOW "THE GOOD WIFE," RIGHT HERE ON CBS. PLEASE WELCOME JULIANNA MARGULIES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVES JULIANNA MARGUILIES.
I THINK-- I THINK-- I HEARD JUST BEFORE I CAME HERE THAT THE-- I'M ON THE BOARD OF MCC THEATER COMPANY. AND WE HAVE A YOUTH PROGRAM, AND SOMEONE TOLD ME THEY WERE HERE TONIGHT.
Stephen: ARE THERE YOUTHFUL PEOPLE HERE TONIGHT?
I THINK THEY'RE HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU, GUYS. THAT WAS JUST COINCIDENCE, BY THE WAY.
Stephen: WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHECK I.D., OKAY?
IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM.
Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. THIS IS EXCITED.
Stephen: THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL DRESS.
WHY, THANK YOU, STEPHEN. I'M WEARING IT FOR YOU.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M WEARING A SUIT BECAUSE LEGALLY I CAN'T BE NAKED ON AIR. THIS SEASON, YOUR CHARACTER, ALICIA, HAS HAD A LITTLE FALL FROM GRACE BECAUSE SHE HAD A SCANDAL IN THE LAST SEASON.
SHE HAD A SCANDAL. THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE THREW HER UNDER THE THE BUS FOR VOTER FRAUD BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO KEEP SOMEONE IN THE SENATE. AND SO SHE TOOK THE FALL, AND SHE'S NOW AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.
Stephen: SHE'S IN SOMETHING CALLED BOND COURT.
HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT?
Stephen: NO, NOT UNTIL TODAY. WHAT IS BOND COURT. IS THAT LIKE WHERE ALL THE CRIMES OF JAMES BOND GET FIXED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? "HE STOLE MY MOTORCYCLE AND RODE IT ACROSS A ROOF!" WHAT IS BOND COURT?
BOND COURT IS ACTUALLY, I THINK, SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT MORE SERIOUSLY, AND I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT BOND COURT UNTIL WE STARTED SHOOTING THIS. AND WE STARTED SHOOTING THE THE WHOLE BOND COURT SERIES IN JULY AND THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT WHILE WE WERE SHOOTING THOSE BOND COURT EPISODES ABOUT-- IT WAS IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES," COVER OF THE MAGAZINE SECTION, ABOUT JUST HOW UNJUST BOND COURT IS TO BOTH THE LAWYERS THAT REPRESENT THESE POOR PEOPLE AND TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU GET 10 MINUTES. THAT'S IT. TO PLEAD YOUR CASE IN BOND COURT.
Stephen: HOW MUCH OF THIS HAVE YOU HAD TO LEARN? DO YOU INNING A PINCH-- YOU'RE VERY SELF-POSSESSED, YOU PRESENT VERY WELL, YOU'RE AN ACTRESS-- COULD YOU GO INTO COURT RIGHT NOW AND FAKE YOUR WAY WITH THIS STUFF? COULD YOU GO INTO BOND COURT RIGHT NOW AND SAY, "I OBJECT?"
I WISH I COULD. I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH.
Stephen: COME ON.
I HATE READING THE FINE PRINT AND YOU HAVE TO READ ALL THOSE CONTRACTS AND I CAN'T DO IT.
Stephen: YEAH, I'VE GOT A FAMILY FULL OF LAWYERS. I HAVE 10 BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND A LOT OF THEM ARE LAWYERS, AND THE LAW FIRM OF COLBERT, COLBERT, AND COLBERT. AND I KIND OF THOUGHT I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER UNTIL I REALIZED IT'S NOT LIKE GOING, "I OBJECT," AND DRIVING AROUND ON YOUR CELL PHONE SAYING, "LET'S TEAR THEM A NEW ONE." THERE IS A LOT OF WORK AND READING INVOLVED.
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A LAWYER AND GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL IN 1927.
Stephen: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE BACK IN THE DAY.
SHE WAS THE FIRST CLASS THAT EVER GRADUATED WOMEN. WOMEN GRADUAT GRADUATED FROM HER CLASS. WHEN SHE GRADUATED, WOMEN WERE ALLOWED TO TAKE THE BAR BUT THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO JOIN THE BAR ASSOCIATION. SO HER AND MY GREAT-AUNT STARTED THE WOMEN'S BAR ASSOCIATION IN THE BRONX. SO I ALWAYS THOUGHT I SHOULD-- I SHOULD BE A LAWYER. SHE WAS A SUFFRAGETTE,UN, SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO REALLY WALKED THE WALK, AND PAVED THE WAY FOR THE REST OF US. AND I JUST-- ONCE I GOT TO SCHOOL AND STARTED REALIZING HOW MANY THINGS YOU HAD TO READ, I WAS LIKE-- ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S HARD! IT'S --
SPEAKING OF POLITICS, THE SHOW IS PART LAW, PART POLITICS, AND CHRIS NOTH, YOUR HUSBAND CHARACTER, IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
HE'S DECLARED.
Stephen: AND THIS TAKE PLACE IN THE REAL WORLD SO HE MIGHT BE RUNNING AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON IN THE WORLD OF THE SHOW, RIGHT?
THE TRUTH IS WE HAD AN EPISODE LAST YEAR WHERE HE SAID I'M THINKING OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, BUT I'M REALLY RUNNING FOR HILLARY'S VICE PRESIDENT. BUT THE POLLS WENT UP, AND HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAINST HILLARY.
Stephen: SHE WAS HERE YESTERDAY.
I KNOW, SHE WATCHES THE MY SHOW.
Stephen: TELL EVERYBODY HOW THE WORLD FOUND OUT SHE DID THIS.
SO SHE-- HER E-MAILS CAME OUT.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH, THE E-MAIL HAD TO BE-- HER E-MAILS HAD TO BE RELEASED.
HER E-MAILS WERE RELEASED AND IT SAID, "WHAT TIME IS 'THE GOOD WIFE' AND 'PARKS AND RECREATION'" ON.
Stephen: SHE LIKES YOUR SHOW SO MUCH, YOU'RE A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT?
I'M VERY MOVED SHE WATCHES THE SHOW BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED PEOPLE WOULD TAKE-- IT'S A LITTLE CLOSE TO HOME.
Stephen: SURE, SURE.
I STARTED OUT AS --
A WIFE WHO STOOD BY HER HUSBAND WHO STRAYED.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. YES, EXACTLY, WHO STRAYED. MY SITUATION WAS A LOT WORSE, OBVIOUSLY. BUT THAT-- THAT KIND OF GLARE FROM-- FROM A FAMILY TRAGEDY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, IN THE PUBLIC'S EYES AND BEING LOOKED AT LIKE, THAT I WOULD THINK SOMEONE WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE THAT. BUT --
WOULD DO YOU THAT? WOULD YOU REALLY DO THAT? WOULD YOU SORT OF STAND BY. ♪ STAND BY YOUR MAN ♪ WOULD YOU DO THAT, STAND BY YOUR MAN?
IF HE SLEPT WITH HOOKERS? ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, I GUESS IN A WEIRD WAY, IT'S-- ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, I MEAN, BETTER THEY'RE WITH HOOKERS BECAUSE YOU DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH A HOOKER. LIKE --
THAT'S A VERY POSITIVE-- THAT'S A VERY POSITIVE POINT OF VIEW. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WILL MAKE A LOVELY, LIKE, ANNIVERSARY CARD.
"HONEY, I FORGIVE YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH HOOKERS."
Stephen: BETTER WITH HOOKERS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY DOES THAT HONESTLY. BUT THE TRUTH IS ALICIA DIDN'T REALLY STAND BY HIM. IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE. IT'S SUCH AN INTERESTING CHARACTER TO PLAY BECAUSE SHE'S STANDING BY HIM BECAUSE SHE'S SEEING THE POLITICAL GAIN FOR HER AND THE GAIN SHE HAS IN A COURTROOM WITH A JUDGE AND THE GAIN SHE HAS IN A LAW FIRM EXPECT SO IT'S FUN TO WATCH ALICIA FALL TO THE BOTTOM AGAIN AND CRAWL BACK UP AND SEE IS ESCALATE AND SEE HOW THEY'RE SO ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER. THEY GIVE EACH OTHER POWER. AND, AND IT'S REALLY FASCINATE AGO.
Stephen: AND YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IN A CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY A PUBLIC RELATIONSHIP, ONLY THE OTHER PERSON KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: SO THEY'RE HOME BASE, NO MATTER WHAT THAT BASE LIKE.
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE FACT THAT HILLARY WATCHES AND I, YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY OBAMA AND --
WOW, NAME DROP. LOOK AT THAT.  ( APPLAUSE ).
NO, I SAY IT BECAUSE VALERIE JARRET WAS ON OUR SHOW --
HOLD ON.
RIGHT, RIGHT. SHOULD I KEEP GOING. GEORGE CLOONEY.
Stephen: NO, I HAD GEORGE CLOONEY, TOO.
BUT VALERIE JARRET WAS ON OUR SHOW, AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW, LET OBAMA KNOW I WORKED FOR HIS CAMPAIGN." AND SHE SAID, "HE KNOWS." I SAID, "I KNOW, I GOT A LETTER OF THANKS AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW I'M APPRECIATIVE." SHE SAID, "HE WROTE THE LETTER." AND I SAID, "I KNOW HE DIDN'T WRITE THE LETTER." AND I THINK SHE FELT BAD AND WENT AND TOLD HIM WHAT I THOUGHT.
Stephen: JULIANNA MARGUILIES SAYS YOU'RE A LIAR. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE SEASON.
IT'S A GOOD SEASON, INTERESTING TOPICS. PLEASE WATCH.
Stephen: THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE DESPERATE. ( LAUGHTER ).
NO, WE JUST-- WE'RE SO CURRENT, AND WE JUST DID THIS HUGE THING ON THE DRIERLESS CAR, HUGE LAWSUIT. I'M PANICKED THAT THESE CARS ARE COMING OUT.
Stephen: WOULD YOU WANT TO DRIVE ONE OF THOSE CARS.
NO!
Stephen: WHY NOT?
BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN'T BE TEXTING WHILE DRIVING ANYWAY AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT THEM FOR SO THEY CAN --
HERE'S WHAT I WANT. I WANT TO NAP WHILE DRIVING. ( LAUGHTER ) WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT? WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT? DON'T YOU EVER WANT TO NAP WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING?
NO! I ACTUALLY --
WAIT, A SECOND, DO YOU EVEN DRIVE ANYMORE, MISS CBS STAR.
I DRIVE, I LOVE DRIVING. HERE'S THE THING-- I THINK DRIVERLESS CARS SHOULD BE FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE, ANYONE WHO NEEDS HELP DRIVING BECAUSE OF A PHYSICAL HANDICAP, GREAT. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE AN SKEWS-- WELL, IT'S A GREAT --
NEXT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME I CAN'T PARK IN THE HANDICAPPED SPACED. ( LAUGHTER ).
SO, LIKE, WE'RE DOING CURRENT, INTERESTING-- THAT'S WHY I WAS HAPPY THAT PEOPLE OF HIGH-BROW NATURE LIKE OBAMA AND MRS.  CLINTON --
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT YOU MEANT ME. YOU'RE GOING "HIGH BROW NATURE" FOR JUST A SECOND, I HAD A SHRED, I HAD A SHRED OF DIGNITY.
YOU'RE SO HIGH BROW, COME ON.
Stephen: I LIKE YOU NOW.
COME ON. I MEAN --

Stephen: WOW, YOU SPRINTED. SO FEW OF MY GUESTS SPRINT OUT TO THE DESK.
I ALWAYS SPRINT WHEN I GO ONSTAGE WHEN I'M DOING MY READING, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: I ALWAYS SPRINT WHEN I GO UPSTAIRS BECAUSE I FIGURE IF I CONTINUE TO SPRINT NOW, WHEN I'M 80 I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WALK UP THEM.
THERE IS THAT.
Stephen: PROBABLY ISN'T TRUE. I'M PROBABLY JUST SNAP A HIP. YOU'RE A NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER, A PULITZER PRIZE FINIST, YOUR NOVELS INCLUDE THE CORRECTIONS," "FREEDOM," AND NOW YOU HAVE A NEW NOVEL "PURITY." THERE IT IS, JONATHAN FRANZEN.  ( APPLAUSE ).
I FEEL LIKE YOUR FOLLOW-UP QUESTION IS GOING TO BE, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON LATE-NIGHT TV?"
Stephen: NO, I CARE WHO YOU ARE. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. , STEPHEN.
Stephen: YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE-- YOU'RE A SERIOUS WRITER.
YEAH...
Stephen: AND YOU SAY-- NO, YOU ARE A SERIOUS WRITER.
NO, I AM.
Stephen: YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CULTURE, AND YOU SAY YOU WANT SERIOUS READERS. WHAT'S A SERIOUS READER? IS IT SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS A BOOK BUT DOESN'T SHOW IT? ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I MEAN, YOU CAN BE A SERIOUS COMIC WRITER, I THINK, BUT THE SERIOUS READER-- I WAS IN TEXAS IN SEPTEMBER. I HAD A FREE DAY BETWEEN AUSTIN AND HOUSTON --
THIS WAS ON THE BOOK TOUR.
IT WAS A BOOK TOUR, YES, AND I WENT TO A PRISON IN A HARD-TO-GET TO AREA A COUPLE OF HOURS NORTH OF HOUSTON TO SEE A SERIOUS READER WHO IS STILL A YOUNGISH MAN WHO I HAVE BEEN CORRESPONDING WITH FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. HE WENT TO PRISON WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 22 FOR CONSENSUAL SEX WITH AN UNDERAGED BOY. 20-YEAR SENTENCE, AND SHE IS SOMEBODY WHO-- YOU KNOW, NOT COOL, REALLY, TO BE A GAY GUY IN THE TEXAS PRISON SYSTEM-- BASICALLY NOT COOL TO BE IN THE TEXAS PRISON SYSTEM, PERIOD. BUT YOU REALLY HAVE THE SENSE THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAVED, WHAT KEPT HIM SANE IN PRISON WAS THE PRISON LIBRARY. AND FINDING BOOKS THAT COULD HELP HIM MAKE SENSE OF WHAT IT HAPPENED TO HIS LIFE, AND THAT GAVE HIM THE SENSE THAT HE WAS NOT ALONE WITH THE WEIRD THING THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM. SO I THINK THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A SERIOUS READER.
Stephen: SO THAT SERIOUS READER SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS A SERIOUS NEED FOR WHAT THE BOOK IS.
EXACTLY. NEEDS --
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SNOB TO BE A SERIOUS READER.
NO, NO, I DON'T THINK. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY CLOSEST TO SEVENTH DAYAT VENTIST.
Stephen: SO FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S FOR EVERYBODY.
EXACTLY. IT'S AN OPEN CHURCH, ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: UNITARIAN. WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE IS A GOD, BUT IF-- IF-- IF THERE IS A GOD, HIS BOOK IS SELLING VERY WELL. ( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S RIGHT. WELL-- ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD POINT. ALTHOUGH, DON'T THEY GIVE THEM AWAY FOR FREE.
Stephen: WHAT?
DON'T THEY GIVE THEM AWAY FOR FREE.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE HOTEL ROOM.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN THE PAST, SORT OF DISTRESSED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE AMERICAN READER. SO FEW PEOPLE READ NOVELS ANYMORE.
NO, I THINK YOU HAVE MISTAKEN ME FOR SOMEONE WHO CARES WHETHER PEOPLE READ BOOKS OR NOT.
Stephen: WOW! REALLY? BUT YOU WRITE BOOKS. YOU DON'T CARE IF PEOPLE READ BOOKS ANYMORE?
I LIKE IT WHEN THEY DO, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR FREE TIME.
Stephen: WELL, YOU DON'T LIKE TWITTER. THAT'S FOR DAMN SURE.
NO, I DO THINK-- IT IS TRUE, AS SOMEBODY WHO ENJOYS A COMPLICATED SENTENCE, I HAVE A RESISTANCE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU.
Stephen: YOU CAN-- YOU CAN JAM-- YOU CAN JAM SOMETHING PRETTY COMPLICATED INTO 140 CHARACTERS, THOUGH.
IT'S-- IT'S HARD TO CREATE A SENTENCE THAT USED THE WORD "ALTHOUGH" IN IT, IN 140 CHARACTER S.
Stephen:  REALLY, JONATHAN FRANZEN SAYS IT'S HARD TO USE THE WORD ALTHOUGH, ALTHOUGH, I JUST DID. 140 CHARACTERS OR LESS. I PROMISE YOU.
NO, YOU CAN, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF SENTENCE THAT MIGHT HAVE AN "ALTHOUGH" IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE ALTHOUGH. YOU LIKE WORDS.
I DO.
Stephen: I THINK IT MIGHT BE THE WORST POSSIBLE NAME FOR A CLOWN. "ALTHOUGH THE CLOWN." I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU CAN USE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) JUST SAY SOME OF MY IDEAS ARE FROM STEPHEN COLBERT IN YOUR NEXT BOOK. SO IF I LIKE THE BOOK, IF I LIKE THE BOOK-- I HAVEN'T READ IT YET. I HAVEN'T READ IT YET. I'M A BUSY MAN. I AM, I'M A BUSY MAN. IF I LIKE THE BOOK WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I NOT TWEET THAT I LIKED IT? BECAUSE I HAVE ALMOST 10 MILLION FOLLOWERS AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO SULLY THE PURITY. OF "PURITY" BY TELLING EVERYBODY THEY LIKED IT.
NO, IF YOU WOULD TWEET THAT YOU LIKED IT, AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU WOULD TWEET THAT YOU LAUGHED, I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
Stephen: OH, REALLY?
I MEAN, IT EXISTS. I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO DISINVENT TWITTER.
Stephen: OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE NOT A LUDDITE.
NO, NOT AT ALL. I SPEND ALL DAY ON COMPUTERS.
Stephen: OKAY. DO YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH NONSERIOUS BOOKS? DO YOU HAVE SORT OF TRASH LITERATURE THAT YOU READ LIKE THE "WHITE CASTLE" VERSION OF BOOKS THAT YOU READ? IS THERE SOME SNACK, SOME DORITOS VERSION OF BOOKS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GOBBLE UP SOMETIMES?
IT'S CALLED "FOX NFL SUNDAY."
Stephen: YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THAT ANYMORE. IT'S AVAILABLE ON TV NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY MADE A TV SHOW OUT OF THAT BOOK. BUT DO YOU READ-- LIKE PEOPLE SAY, "DO YOU READ THIS?" AND YOU WOULD SAY, "I WOULD NEVER READ THAT."
NO, I'M A BUSY MAN, TOO, AND I WOULD RATHER SPEND MY DOWN TIME WATCHING SPORTS ON TV.
Stephen: HOW BUSY ARE YOU, THOUGH? YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN TIME. YOU'RE A NOVELIST, YOU COULD SAY, "I'M TAKING TODAY OFF" RIGHT?
I DID THAT BASICALLY WITH THE YEAR 20002. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HOW DO YOU SCHEDULE YOUR DAY? HOW DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, "OKAY, I WILL WRITE FOR THREE HOURS." OR, "IT WILL BE 40 PAGES." OR DO YOU WRITE UNTIL YOU FEEL LIKE I COULD GO FOR SOME CHIPOTEL. HOW DO YOU SCHEDULE YOURSELF?
WHEN IT'S WORKING, I GET UP IN THE MORNING, LIKE 7:00, AND GO AND TRY TO WRITE 1,000 WORDS AND TRY TO DO THAT SIX OR SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND THEN NEVER GO LONGER THAN FIVE HOURS.
Stephen: OKAY.
YOU'RE GIVING ME THE "HOW DO YOU WORK" QUESTION, AND IT'S GOOD. IT'S NICE TO TALK ABOUT IT. GET IT OFF MY CHEST.
Stephen: DOES EVERYONE ASK YOU THAT QUESTION?
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE BEEN ASKED BEFORE, YES. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: LET'S EDIT THAT OUT. LET'S EDIT THAT OUT. ( LAUGHTER )
BUT EVERYONE OF YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS HAS BEEN COMPLETELY ORIGINAL AND FRESH.
Stephen: THANK YOU.
YES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

TUNE IN TOMORROW WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE SETH MacFARLANE AND NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. BEFORE WE GO, IT'S AWFULLY LATE. SO LET'S HEAR A LITTLE BEDTIME STORY FROM NATIONAL BOOK AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR, JONATHAN FRANZEN. JONATHAN, WOULD YOU READ US A LITTLE BEDTIME STORY?
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.
Stephen: WE'RE READY. "ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS A GIRL NAMED LITTLE RED READING HOOD WHO LOVED HER GRANDMOTHER'S LOCAL INDEPENDENT BOOKSTORE. ( LAUGHTER ) ONE DAY, WHEN SHE WENT TO THE STORE TO BUY A COOKBOOK, THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS WOLF BEHIND THE COUNTER. YES, A TERRIBLE WOLF. THE WOLF WAS WEARING THE GRANDMOTHER'S GRANNY GLASSES AND HER OAKLAND RAIDERS CAP. ( LAUGHTER ) "WHY, GRANDMOTHER," SAID LITTLE RED READING HOOD, "WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE!" "THE BETTER TO SEE YOUR CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND TARGET YOU WITH ADVERTISING," THE WOLF SAID. "BUT GRANDMOTHER," SAID LITTLE RED READING HOOD, "WHAT BIG EARS YOU HAVE!" "THE BETTER TO HEAR YOUR OPINIONS ABOUT THE PRODUCTS I SELL," THE WOLF SAID. "BUT GRANDMOTHER," THE GIRL SAID, "WHAT BIG HANDS YOU HAVE!" "THE BETTER TO GIVE YOU FREE OVERNIGHT SHIPPING," THE WOLF SAID. "OH, BUT, GRANDMOTHER, WHAT BIG TEETH YOU HAVE!" SAID LITTLE RED READING HOOD. "THE BETTER TO GOBBLE UP EVERY RETAILER IN THE WORLD," THE WOLF SNARLED, "BECAUSE THEN I CAN GOBBLE UP EVERY CONSUMER, TOO, AND FINALLY EARN A PROFIT FOR MY SHAREHOLDERS!" ( LAUGHTER ) WITH THAT, THE WOLF LEAPED FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER AND SWALLOWED LITTLE RED READING HOOD. THEN, DROWSY FROM HIS MEAL, HE FELL ASLEEP, AND ALONG CAME THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, LOOKING FOR THE MULTINATIONAL MONOPOLY THAT HAD WIPED OUT LOCAL RETAILERS AND SET UP LOW-WAGE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN TAX-FRIENDLY STATES. THE DEPARTMENT SCISSORED OPEN HIS BELLY, AND OUT TUMBLED LITTLE RED READING HOOD, HER BELOVED GRANDMOTHER, HER GRANDMOTHER'S EMPLOYEES, AND MILLIONS OF OTHER RETAILERS AND CONSUMERS. THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER."
Stephen: WOW, WELL, THANK YOU, JONATHAN. THAT WAS A SCARY STORY. CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING? IS THE WOLF A METAPHOR FOR SOMETHING?
POSSIBLY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IS IT ZAPOSE? IS IT ZAPPOS? YOU KNOW, WOLFS ARE ENDANGERED. IT'S ILLEGAL TO HURT A WOLF, JONATHAN FRANZEN.
IT WAS-- IT WAS JUST A LITTLE PAIR OF SCISSORS. IT WAS SOWN RIGHT BACK UP.
Stephen: REALLY, SEWN BACK UP? DON'T SAY THAT PART IN THE STORY. SAY CUT OFF THE THE WOLF. YOU COULD BE ARRESTED, JONATHAN FRANZEN.
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CUT OPEN THE WORLD, NOT ME.
Stephen: SO IT'S OKAY THE GOVERNMENT DID IT. JONATHAN FRANZEN'S BOOK IS "PURITY." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) GET IT TODAY. GOOD NIGHT!  Captioning sponsored by CBS  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
