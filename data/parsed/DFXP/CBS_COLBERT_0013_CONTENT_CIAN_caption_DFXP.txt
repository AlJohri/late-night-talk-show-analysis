(LAUGHTER) AND TONIGHT, AND TONIGHT OUR ENTIRE SHOW IS DEDICATED TO POPE FRANCIS'S HISTORIC VISIT TO THE USA. IT'S AN HOUR-LONG SO IT MIGHT BE THE SHORTEST CATHOLIC SERVICE YOU'LL EVER SIT THROUGH.

(APPLAUSE) TONIGHT, I WELCOME JIM GAFFIGAN, MARIA SHRIVER, ANDREW SULLIVAN, ARCHBISHOP THOMAS WENSKI. THE YMCA JERUSALEM YOUTH CHORUS, FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU, JON BATISTE. THANK YOU, JOE. THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU. FOLKS, I AM, I AM EXCITED, NO, MORE THAN THAT, I AM BLESSED THAT YOU ARE ALL HERE FOR OUR SPECIAL POPE SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO POPE IT UP. WE HAVE BEEN GETTING READY FOR THIS FOR A MONTH. IN FACT WE MADE A SPECIAL POPE SHOW OPENING AM JIM, THE POPENING. >> TOUR DEFRANCIS, A NEW POPE, I HEART NY HOLY C, HUMBLEFEST TO 16. -- 2016. >> I THINK THAT'S KIND OF COOL. BUT NOW THAT HE'S HERE AND I SEE HOW MODEST THE POPE IS BEING I REALIZE I NEED SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS FLASHY. SO LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE HERE. OKAY. WELCOME. (APPLAUSE) THAT'S MY KIND OF INCENSE. NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH CATHOL SIM, FIRST OF ALL, ENJOY AN ETERNITY IN LIMBO. SECRETARY, I SECOND YOU MIGHT BE SAYING TO YOURSELF WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT, AFTER ALL ISN'T THE POPE JUST AN OL GUY IN A DRESS WHO SAYS HE TALKS TO GOD. THERE WAS A GUY LIKE ON ON MY TRAIN THIS MORNING. WELL, LET'S TAKE A MOMENT RIGHT NOW TO EXPLORE WHAT MAKES THE HOLY FATHER SO HOLY FASCINATING IN TONIGHT'S THE DOPE ON THE POPE. THE POPE IS THE LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THE HEAD OF STATE FOR VATICAN CITY. IT IS MY FAVORITE AUTONOMOUS ENCLAVE WITHIN A MAJOR CITY, RIGHT AFTER THE DALLAS AIRPORT CHILIS 2. HIS HOLINESS IS KNOWN BY PAIN NAMES, IL PAPA, BISHOP OF ROME, VICAR OF CHRIST, SUPREME PONTIFF AND ON WORLD OF WARCRAFT, ATHROG THE DEATH HAMMER. (LAUGHTER) THE PAPACY ITSELF GOT ITS START 2,000 YEARS AGO WHEN JESUS TOLD HIS APOSTLE WHO WAS THEN CALLED SIMON, QUOTE, SIMON BAR JONAH, THOUGHU ART PET ARE AND UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH, AND THAT IS HOW THE APOSTLE SIMON BECAME PETER "THE ROCK" HAVE SON. BECAUSE PETER WAS HIRED BY JESUS HIMSELF. EACH OF HIS SUCCESSORS HAS A DIRECT LINK TO GOD. IT'S ONE OF THE PAIN BENEFITS TO BEING A POPE ALONG WITH COMPREHENSIVE DENTAL AND INFALLIBILITY WHICH IS ONLY WHEN THE POPE IS SPEAKING EX CATHEDRA OR FROM THE SEAT OF ST. PETER, BUT IF ARE YOU JUST HANGING OUT CASUALLY AND THE POPE SAYS THE GODFATHER III IS A WORTHY CONCLUSION TO THE TRIOLOGY, FEEL FREE TO CALL BULL. AND WHILE THIS POPE SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SOLID DUDE, THE POPES OF THE PAST HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A MIXED BAG. THERE WERE THE THREE POPES OF AVIGNON, THE BORGIAS WHO LOVED THEIR ORGIES, THE PITT CALL FEMALE POPE JOAN AND THE BRIEF BUT HILARIOUS REIGN OF POPE RALPH. SKIPPING AHEAD, SKIPPING AHEAD TO THE -- CENTURY ONE OF THE MOST TRANSFORM DIFFICULT POPES WAS POPE JOHN 23 SHOWN HERE IN THE WITH THE CAPE WITH DA FUR. JOHN THE 23rd EVERSAW THE DRAMATIC REFORMS OF THE 2nd VATICAN COUNCIL OR AS IT IS MORE KPONLY KNOWN VATICAN 2 THE FAST AND THE AN CITY NATIONAL. JOHN THE 23rd IS THE ROLE MODEL OF POPE FRANCIS WHO AS WE TAPED IT IS TOUCHING DOWN AT NEW YORK'S KENNEDY AIRPORT, ASSUMING HE MADE IT THROUGH SECURITY. THE FLOWING ROBE AND RELIGIOUS HEAD GEAR ARE TSA BAIL. OF COURSE TOMORROW IS THE BIG EVENT, A MASS AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. IT'S GOING TO BE UNFORGETABLE WHEN HIS HOLINESS DUNKS OFF A TRAMPOLINE. HE COULD BE-- HE COULD BE THE FIRST POPE EVER TO PULL OFF A 3 OF 0 TOMAHAWK BAPTISM-- BUT SHEBANG. BUT HIS HOLINESS STARTED HIS DAY IN OUR NATION'S CAPITOL WHERE HE BECAME THE FIRST PONTIFF TO ADDRESS A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS. >> THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL. >> Stephen: I HAVE TO CLEAR SUPING REALLY QUICKLY, CATHOLICS DO NOT SPEAK IN TONGUES. THAT WAS JUST HIS ACCENT. AND WHILE THERE WERE THINGS THE POPE SAID TODAY THAT BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF, THERE WAS ONE MOMENT THAT BROUGHT THE WHOLE CONGRESS TOGETHER. >> LET US REMEMBER THE GOLDEN RULE. DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU--  (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WHOOO! WHO! YEAH! DO UNTO OTHERS, YEAH! -- I'M SURE THAT'S THE ENOF THE SAYING. MOVING ON! SOMETHING CONGRESS CAN LIVE BY. AND AFTER THE SPEECH, HE HAD LUNCH WITH THE HOMELESS INSTEAD OF THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS, POSSIBLY CUZ HE WANTED TO EAT WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE LESS LIKELY TO BEG HIM FOR DONATIONS. AND--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOLKS, I THINK THAT IS SO REFRESHING. EVEN THOUGH POPE FRANCIS IS A HUGE CELEBRITY NOW, HE'S STAYING TRUE TO HIS HUMBLE NATURE. HE IS ESCHEWING ANY KBLITS GLILINGTS AND GLAMOR NOT COMING ON THE TV SHOWS, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THE DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN, AND SHOULD THE MOOD STRIKE YOU I'M READY FOR YOU HERE IN THE ED SULLIVAN. I STILL HAVE, I STILL HAVE, I STILL HAVE THE HUMBLE-- THE POPECHAIR. (APPLAUSE) YOU WILL NOT FIND A HUMBLEER POPECHAIR. AND IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT, I UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE A BUSY GUY. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M GOING TO BE PRETTY MAD IF I SEE YOU GETTING DAY DRUNK WITH HODA AND KATHY LEE. STICK AROUND. WE HAVE A CELEBRITY POPE PANEL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MISS. >> THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY WARNER BROTHER'S PICTURES "THE INTERN" IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE TOMORROW. >> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, WE RETURN YOU NOW TO TONIGHT'S SPECIAL POPE-ISODE ALREADY IN PROGRESS. LONGER THAN I THOUGHT. WELCOME, FRANK. NOW IN ADDITION TO HIS VAST HUMILITY ONE OF THE REASONS THE POPE IS SO POPULAR IS HE DECRIED THE RISE OF WHAT IS CALLED A THROW AWAY CULTURE, THAT COMPARES THE EXCESSES OF CAPITAL IMTO THE DUNG OF THE DEVIL. AND DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DEVIL'S DUNG. THE ONLY FOOD THEY HAVE IN HELL IS DOORITY OWES LOCO CRUNCH WRAP. IT'S AN INSPIRING MESSAGE OF SHUNNING MATERIAL POSSESSIONS WHICH AMERICANS CAN NOW HONOR BY BUYING CRAP. >> THE OFFICIAL PAPAL VISIT MERCHANDISE STORE IS NOW OPEN HERE IN THE LOBBY OF THE ARAMARK TOWER. PRICES RANGE FROM $5 FOR A POPE MEDALLION DO $70 FOR THE PULLOVERS, AND CRYSTAL ROSARY BEAD FORCE $200. MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES ARE COMING UP WITH CLEVER WAYS TO CASH IN ON ALL THINGS POPE RELATED. >> POPE FAN SIS PICTURES, T-SHIRTS, COFFEE MUGS, MASS CARDS AND EVEN POPE FRANCIS COLOGNE FOR 30 DOLLARS. >> Stephen: YES, POPE FRANCIS COLOGNE BECAUSE WHAT IS MORE FORBIDDEN THAN SMELLING LIKE A 78-YEAR-OLD KEL I BATMAN. (LAUGHTER) HMMMM-- CELIBATE MAN. OH. (APPLAUSE) SOME OF THE OFFICIAL PAPAL MERCH INCLUDE PLATES, JEWELRY, AND THIS POSTCARD SIZE TRAY OF FINE PORCELAIN WITH REAL GOLD RIM FEATURING A TWEET FROM POPE FRANCIS. YES, A TWEET FROM THE POPE. THIS WILL GO GREAT WITH MY DINNER PLATE OF MOTHER THERESA'S DUCKFACE SNAPCHAT. BUT--  (LAUGHTER) THERE'S ALSO THE POPE FRANCIS, AND THIS IS TRUE, LIFE SIZE STANDEE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF YOU ARE'S NOT ABLE TO ATTEND ONE OF THE EVENTS IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS PUT THIS IN YOUR BEDROOM AND TER FEW YOUR CHILDREN. AND REMEMBER, BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO USE THE CARPOOL LANE. AND AFTER THE POPE SAID LAST WEEK BEFORE HE CAME OVER HERE THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO TRY A SLICE OF NEW YORK'S FAMOUS PIZZA, LOCAL PIZZA PLACES ARE TRYING TO LURE HIS HOLINESS TO THEIR SHOPS WITH CUSTOM PIES LIKE THIS ONE. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS IS TRUE. THEY'RE REALLY DOING THIS. AND I BELIEVE IT'S THE PERFECT TREAT FOR SOMEONE WHOSE ENTIRE OUTFIT IS A NAPKIN. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. I'VE BEEN SNAPPING UP ALL THE POPE MERCH I CAN. FOR EXAMPLE, I GOT THIS ACTUAL POPE HAT, POPE FRANCIS IN THE USA HAT. AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE LADY POPE HAT, WHICH MIGHT BE THE CLOSEST LADIES WILL EVER COME. AND THEY'VE GOT-- NO, YOU KNOW THE RULES, RIGHT? SPOILER ALERT. NO FEMALE POPE. AND THEY'VE EVEN PUT POPE FRANCIS STICKERS ON THE FACE OF THIS SET OF THREE 50 CENT PIECES WHICH ARE YOURS FOR $24.99. YOU ONLY NEED 17 OF THESE TO BUY ONE OF THEM. WHEN WE RETURN, I'LL TALK WITH MY FELLOW CATHOLICS MARIA SHRIVER, ANDREW SULLIVAN AND JIM GAFFIGAN ABOUT POPE FRANCIS. STICK AROUND (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THE POPE'S VISIT TO AMERICA IS A MAJOR MOMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR AMERICAN CATHOLICS. HERE TO DISCUSS IT ARE THREE CATHOLICS YOU MIGHT KNOW. FORMER FIRST LADY OF CALIFORNIA, JOURNALIST MARIA SHRIVER, JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR A ANDREW SULLIVAN AND COMEDIAN JIM GAFFIGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANKS FOR BEING PUBLICLY KATH LICK FOR ME TONIGHT. >> I WILL BE CRUCIFIED LATER, RIGHT? >> MAYBE IN THE PRESS. NOW I'M A CATHOLIC, Y'ALL ARE CATHOLICS. BUT I'M ALSO AN AMERICAN. DO YOU GUYS FEEL ANY TENSION BETWEEN BEING AN AMERICAN AND BEING A CATHOLIC AT THE SAME TIME? >> PROUD. NO TENSION. >> Stephen: NO TENSION? REALLY BECAUSE -- >> ESPECIALLY TODAY. >> Stephen: BECAUSE I'M HAPPY THAT HE'S HERE AM BUT AMERICANS, AMERICANS HAVE THIS SORT OF SPIRIT OF INDIVIDUALITY, AND WE GET TO DO ANYTHING WE WANT. AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS THE SPIRIT OF AH, NOT REALLY. (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I FEEL THAT TENSION ALL THE TIME. >> AMERICAN CATHS DID SHALL DID -- AMERICAN CATHOLICS DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. >> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. CAN YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND STILL BE A CATHOLIC, AN CREW-- ANDREW? >> NO, OF COURSE NOT. >> Stephen: YOU'RE GAY. YOU'RE GAY, SPOILER. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: SPOILER ALERT. THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES, MY FRIEND. CUZ YOU'RE AN OPENLY GAY CATHOLIC MAN OR OPENLY CATHOLIC GAY MAN, I'M SURE BOTH OF THOSE ARE NOT EASY. DO YOU FEEL A TENSION BETWEEN YOUR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND YOUR FAITH? >> MY ANSWER TO THAT IS WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME HOW CAN YOU BE OPENLY GAY AND CATHOLIC AT THE SAME TIME IS TO SAY I'M OPENLY GAY BECAUSE I'M A CATHOLIC. BECAUSE I WAS BROUGHT UP TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT MYSELF, AND BECAUSE I WAS TAUGHT TO TREAT EVERY HUMAN BEING WITH EQUAL DIGNITY AND LOVE AND COMPASSION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: BUT HERE'S HE WHERE, AND MAYBE Y'ALL CAN JUMP IN ON THIS, BUT HERE IS BEN WHERE THE TENSION IS WE WERE ALSO TAUGHT, I WAS TAUGHT AS A CATHOLIC, THERE WERE TWO THINGS MY DAD SAID, APOSTLE'S CREED AND FOLLOW PETER AM LIKE WHEN ALL ELSE FAIL, THOSE TWO AND YOU WILL BE FINE AS A CATHOLIC AM BUT I'M AN AMERICAN. WE GOT RID OF A GUY WEARING ROBES AND A CROWN ON A THRONE IN 1776 AND THE POPE WEARS A CROWN AND SITS ON THE THRONE. HOW CAN I BE OBEDIENT TO A POPE AND BE A CATHOLIC AMERICAN AT THE SAME TIME. >> BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT SAY LITTLE, NOT TO CRITICIZE YOU. >> Stephen: CRITICIZE AWAY. >> ISN'T THAT LIKE, WASN'T IT THE CONCERN THAT WE SHOULDN'T ELECT JFK BECAUSE HE MIGHT TAKE ORDERS FROM THE POPE? I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT, THAT'S A DISTANT IDEA OF WHAT BEING A CATHOLIC, THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE DIRECT ORDERS FROM THE POPE. >> Stephen: THAT IS A DISTANT IDEA FOR AMERICANS. IT'S NOT A DISTANT IDEA FOR THE CHURCH. >> WE JUST DID A POLL AND IT SAID A THIRD OF CATHOLICS FELT THAT IF A CATHOLIC WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT, A THIRD FELT THAT THEY WOULD TAKE ORDERS FROM ROME BEFORE THEY WOULD SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO IT'S NOT THAT OLD. >> Stephen: I DON'T MEAN TO CRITICIZE YOU, JIM, BUT HER UNCLE WAS JFK. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THAT'S CALLED A BRUSHBACK-- MY FRIEND. >> BUT DID HE TAKE ORDERS FROM THE POPE. >> NO. >> Stephen: DID HE TAKE ORDERS, IT'S FINE, NOW TELL US. THE THE WHOLE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS WAS JOHN 23rd IDEA. >> HE TOOK ORDERS FROM HIS MOTHER. >> HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT PARADOXES HERE IS THAT AMERICA IS IN SOME WAYS ABOUT MONEY. AND ABOUT WEALTH. AND ABOUT PROSPERITY. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT IT HAS BECOME. AND WHAT THE POPE IS CLEARLY SAYING IS THAT THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS MEANS GETTING RID OF WEALTH, GETTING RID OF POSSESSIONS, DISPOSSESSING ONE'S SELF, LOSING ONE'S LIFE IN ORDER TO GAIN IT. THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THE GOSPELS AND THAT IS SOMETHING, SOMEWHAT ALIEN TO SOME STRAINS IN AMERICA. BUT I -- >> HIS NAME IS DONALD TRUMP. >> WELL, YEAH YEAH, GO AHEAD. >> LOOK, I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, THE FRANCIS THAT OUR I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO IS THE YEAR OF MERCY THAT IS WHAT DREW ME TO THE FAITH. I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC BUT MOSTLY AGNOSTIC OR ATHIEST. BUT WHAT BROUGHT ME BACK WAS THE MOTION OF-- NOTION OF MERCY WHICH IS SOMETHING FRANCIS IS BRINGING WHICH GOES AGAINST THIS STANDARD AMERICAN-- YOU KNOW, BEING A CAFETERIA CATHOLIC WAS A HORRIBLE THING AMONG THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY. IT IS LIKE ARE YOU NOT A REAL CATHOLIC, ARE YOU A CAFETERIA CATHOLIC. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT FRANCIS IS SAYING-- I CALL HIM FRANCIS, IS SAYING, WHO AM I TO JUDGE. SO WE'RE NOT, I MEAN LOOK, WHEN YOU CONSIDER IN THE BIBLE JESUS WAS LIKE GIVE UP EVERYTHING AND FOLLOW ME, I MEANS THAT'S ABSURD. YOU CAN SIT THERE AND SAY AMERICAN WAS NEVER DO THAT. BUT NO ONE WOULD DO THAT. SO IT'S LIKE, SO FRANCIS IS TRYING TO DRAW PEOPLE IN BY SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, THE CONCEPT OF MERCY, FORGIVENESS IS A REALLY KIND OF, IT'S AN INVITATION TO PEOPLE. AND IT'S AN INVITATION TO IMPERFECT CATHOLICS. I MEAN I'M PERFECT BUT -- >> THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPERFECT CATHOLICS. >> WE ARE ALL SINNERS. >> WE ARE. MY FAITH, THE REASON I'M A CATHOLIC IS THE NOTION OF MERCY. BECAUSE I'M SUCH A HORRIBLE PERSON, I NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMEONE FORGIVING ME. (LAUGHTER) >> HAVE YOU BEEN TO CONFESSION LATELY? >> YES, I-- YOU KNOW, MAYBE A MONTH AGO. NO, MAYBE LONGER, MAYBE LONGER. >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. >> DID YOU JUST LIE. >> I LIED AGAIN. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: MARIA, SPEAKING OF IMPERFECT CATHOLICS. >> OH, THANKS. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE DONE THIS STUDY, IT'S CALLED INSIGHT INTO THE CONSCIENCE OF THE COMPLEX CATHOLIC. HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU SURVEY HERE. >> IT WAS A THOUSAND PEOPLE, ALL CATHOLICS, WE'RE 70 MILLION, OBVIOUSLY. BUT IT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE OF HOW PEOPLE RESPONDED TO WHAT IS A GOOD CATHOLIC. I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC AND THE IDEA WAS IF YOU ARE ENGAGED IN PREMARITAL SEX YOU WERE A BAD CATHOLIC, RIGHT, IF YOU GOT DIVORCED YOU WERE A BAD CATHOLIC. IF YOU WERE GAY, YOU WERE A BAD CATHOLIC. AND WHAT THESE AMERICAN CATHOLICS ARE SAYING THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL AM I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY REFRESHING. >> Stephen: INTERESTING STATS HERE. IF YOU CAN GET THIS ON OUR-- ARE RIGHT HERE 77% OF THE PEOPLE YOU SURVEYED SAID THAT FRANCIS IS TEACHING MATCH UP WITH THEIR BELIEFS. >> I THINK WHAT HE WAS JUST SAYING, HIS INVITATION TO MERCY. HE TALKS ABOUT COMPASSION, TODAY I WAS ON THE HILL. IT WAS SO INSPIRING. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I WENT TO THE CANONIZATION YESTERDAY AND HE TALKED ABOUT URGING ALL OF US OF ALL FAITHS TO GO OUT AND BE OF SERVICE. AND TO SPREAD THE JOY. AND TO LOOK AT THE OTHER THING HE SAID TODAY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IS THAT ALL OF US KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO FEEL LIKE A FOREIGNER IN SOME WAY. AND THAT THAT IS WHERE THE GOLDEN RULE CAME IN. IS TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED YOURSELF. SO HE SAID A LOT OF THINGS THAT I THINK YOU CAN TAKE INTO YOUR OWN LIFE REGARDLESS IF YOU ARE'S CATHOLIC OR JEWISH OR MUSLIM OR HINDU AND REALLY ABOUT KIND OF SEEING YOUR FELLOW MAN OR FELLOW WOMAN WITH COMPASSION. >> WHAT HE DID TODAY IN THAT SPEECH TO THE CONGRESS, ONE OF THE THINGS HE SAID THAT WAS TRULY REMARKABLE IS WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM THIS IDEA OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL, RIGHTOUS-- RIGHTOUS VERSUS A SINNER. WE ARE ALL SINNERS IN NEED OF THE LOVE OF GOD. AND WHAT -- >> WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT HIS SPEECH ALSO WAS THAT IT COULD NOT BE PAGEONED HOLE INTO A LEFT OR RIGHT SPEECH. BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THERE FOR EVERYONE AND SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE TO FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT DURING THAT SPEECH. >> I LOVED WHAT HE SAID ALSO TODAY IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A CULTURE OF CARE. AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PHRASE. AND THAT WE ALL CAN BE A PART OF THAT. WE CAN ALL PARTICIPATE IN EXPENDING THAT IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. >> Stephen: SPEAKING OF PARTICIPATING, DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT BEING A NUN? >> YES, I DID. >> Stephen: REALLY? >> SO I WENT TO THE CONVENT OF THE SACRED HEART. DON'T LAUGH. >> Stephen: SURE, SURE. >> AND YOU KNOW, AND SO I REMEMBER ASKING THE NUNS, LIKE HOW DID YOU BECOME A NUN? WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW, THIS NUN SAID I USED TO BE A GIRL JUST LIKE YOU. AND I WAS AT HOME IN MY ROOM AND I HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WITH JESUS AND WITH GOD AND THEY CALLED ME TO BECOME A NUN. AND I WAS LIKE WHOA. I WOULD GO HOME EVERY NIGHT, SHUT THE DOOR, DON'T YOU DARE COME IN HERE. DON'T YOU DARE COME IN HERE. (LAUGHTER) >> AND I DID IT A LOT BECAUSE I WAS SO WORRIED THAT I WAS GOING TO GET CALLED. >> Stephen: AND THEN WOULD YOU HAVE TO AGAINST THEN I WOULD HAVE TO GO, I WOULD HAVE TO CUT MY HAIR, I THOUGHT OH PIE GOD. AND SO IT WAS -- >> JIM, YOU ARE GOING TO PERFORM FOR THE POPE IN PHILADELPHIA, RIGHT? >> WELL, I THINK EITHER BEFORE, EITHER THE POPE WILL BE THERE-- EITHER THE POPE WILL BE THERE OR I'M GOING ON BEFORE THE POPEMOBILE. >> Stephen: OPENING FOR THE POPE. >> FOR HIS ARRIVAL. LIKE I DO MY SET. >> Stephen: ARE YOU NERVOUS. DO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR MATERIAL FOR THE POPE? >> IT'S ONLY THE POPE AND A MILLION PEOPLE ON THE BEN FRANKLIN PARKWAY IN PHILADELPHIA. >> Stephen: DO YOU DO SOME OF YOUR OWN MATERIAL. >> I HOPE SO. >> Stephen: BECAUSE BACON IS PROOF THAT GOD LOVES US. >> YES, THAT IS TRUE. THAT IS ONE OF GOD'S BLESSINGS. RIGHT? >> AND THE PROOF THAT THERE IS A HELL -- >> YEAH --. >> Stephen: HOT POCKETS. >> BUT YOU KNOW, STEPHEN, I LIKE TO THINK THIS SHOW, THIS SATURDAY, BY THE WAY, EVERYONE IS INVITED, THIS WORLD MEETING OF FAMILIES. IT IS NONDENOMINATIONAL. EVERYONE COMES FROM A FAMILY SO EVERYONE CAN GO. AND I'M SURE THE SECURITY IN PHILADELPHIA LOVES THAT I JUST SAID THAT. BUT I LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. I'M PERFORMING FOR THE POPE. THIS IS ALL PART OF A WORLD LEADER TOUR. AND THEN I WILL GO TO MOSCOW AND I WILL PERFORM FOR PUTIN. AND THEN--  (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: DALAI LAMA. >> AND THEN I WILL TAPE A SPECIAL IN FRONT OF ISIS. >> Stephen: WELL, MARIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH, JIM, ANDREW, GOOD TO SEE YOU. MARIA SHRIVER, ANDREW SULLIVAN, JIM GAFFIGAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO OUR SPECIAL IS A LUTED TO THE POPE-- SALUTE TO THE POPE. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: NOTHING, NOTHING, THAT'S HOW HUMBLE HE IS. HE DOESN'T GET A FANFARE THIS TIME. (LAUGHTER) TOO LATE, TOO LATE, THE POPE MAY FORGIVE YOU BUT I DO NOT. WELCOME BACK. WELCOME, FRANK, THE CHAIR IS STILL OPEN FOR YOU OVER THERE, YOUR HOLLINESS. AND I AM GOING TO SWEETEN THE OFFER RIGHT NOW BY THROWING IN A FREE POPE STANDEE BECAUSE IT'S BEGINNING TO FREAK ME OUT. POPE, FRANCIS IS TOTALLY MY NEW FAVORITE POPE. I WAS SADDENED, IN FACT, TO HEAR THAT THE POPE HIMSELF IS UNHAPPY. IN A RECENT RADIO INTERVIEW THE POPE CON SES-- CONFESSED, I HAVE FELT USED BY PEOPLE WHO PRESENTED THEMSELVES AS MY FRIENDS IN WHOM I HADN'T SEEN MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE IN MY LIFE, TO USE THAT TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT. I NEVER HAD SO MANY QUOTE, UNQUOTE, FRIENDS AS NOW. THAT'S AWFUL. FRANCIS IS SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SO-CALLED FRIENDS HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW. I TOLL HIM NOT TO JOIN TAYLOR SWIFT'S GIRL SQUAD. WRONG, TAY-TAY, IOLOGICAL FEEL ILL FOR IL PAPA, NOTHING IS WORSE, NOTHING IS WORSE THAN FINDING OUT YOUR FRIENDS ARE JUST USING TO GET CLOSER TO YOUR EVEN MORE POPULAR FRIEND. CUZ THE POPE IS LIKE ANY OF US. A SIMPLE, HUMBLE GUY WHO JUST WANTS TO BE THE VOICE OF GOD TO A BILLION CATHOLICS. HE DOESN'T WANT A CIRCLE OF HANGERS-ON. HE WANTS QUALITY, MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS. AS HE SAID, FRIENDSHIP IS SOMETHING SACRED. THE BIBLE SAYS TO HAVE ONE OR TWO FRIENDS. WHICH OF COURSE IS BAD NEWS FOR TEN OR 11 OF THE APOSTLES. BUT IT DOES PROVE WHAT I HAVE LONG SAID, ENTOURAGE IS THE WORK OF THE DEVIL. WELL, I HATE TO SEE THIS YOUR HOLLINESS, I CAN BE THAT FRIEND FOR YOU. I GET YOU. WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. LIKE YOU, I WAS RECENTLY ELEVATED TO AN INFLUENTIAL POSITION BY AN ALL-SEEING POWER. FOR YOU AND I-- FOR YOU AND I, YOU AND I CAN BE REAL FRIENDS. YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR YOU. SOMEONE TO TEXT YOU AFTER YOU WATCH THE FINALE OF BACHELOR IN PARADISE. WE CAN GET TOGETHER, THROW BACK A FEW MIKE'S HARDS AND JUST TALK. I'M FLUENT IN LATIN, BOTH ANCIENT AND IG-PAY. AND IF YOU FEEL INSPIRED TO GIVE ME A SPECIAL DISPENSATION FOR THAT THING IN HIGH SCHOOL,S THIS'S COULD COOL TOO. I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, ♪ WHEN YOU VISIT NEW YORK CITY ♪ ♪ AND A PIZZA RAT STEALS YOUR HAT ♪ ♪ AND CARDINAL DOLAN, CARDINAL DOLAN IS JUST NOT AROUND ♪ ♪ JUST TEXT ME A SAD FACE EMOJI, AND SOON I WILL BE THERE ♪ WITH SOME FRANKINCENSE, AND WE'LL BURN THAT MOTHER DOWN >> ♪ SO JUST CHANT OUT MY NAME, AND UNLESS THE TRAFFIC IS BAD, ♪ I'LL COME RUNNING, AND WE WILL ♪ FRANK BABY ♪ ♪ AND WE WILL TRANSEND ♪ ♪ HEY BABY ♪ ♪ DON'T YOU KNOW ABOUT ♪ ♪ CHRISTMAS, EASTER, ALL SAINTS OR FALL ♪ ♪ DON'T FORGET URINE FALLABLE AND I'LL BE THERE ♪ ♪ YEAH, YEAH POPE FRANK ♪ ♪ YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND ♪ ♪ EVEN BENEDICT ♪ ♪ YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND ♪ ♪ CAN I GET AN AMEN ♪ ♪ YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND ♪ ♪ FRANK BABY ♪ ♪ YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE BISHOP OF MIAMI, THOMAS WENSKI! >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY NEXT GUEST IS THE ARCHBISHOP OF MIAMI AND A VOCAL SUPPORTER OF POPE FRANCIS'S RECENT CALL TO WORLD LEADERS TO CURB CARBON EMISSIONS. PLEASE WELCOME ARCHBISHOP THOMAS WENSKI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, MAY I ASK WHAT YOU HAVE HERE, SIR SM. >> WELL, I HAVE A GIFT HERE FOR YOU. >> Stephen: DO I HAVE TO WAIT? DO I HAVE TO EARN IT? OR CAN I HAVE IT RIGHT AWAY IT. >> THERE ARE TWO GIFTS, ONE IS FROM THE BISHOP'S CONFERENCE. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> AND THE OTHER ONE IS FROM ME. >> Stephen: OKAY, COME ON, MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK HERE. >> OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE HASHTAG HERE. >> Stephen: OH, I WILL. POPE-- HASHTAG POPE IN US HASHTAG PAPA IN -- I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH BUT I CAN FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE. OH, A MED OF THE ST. GENISIAS. HE IS THE PATRON SAINT OF COMEDIANS, YEAH, THAT'S NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND-- AND CU-- CUBAN CIGARS. (APPLAUSE) >> TALK ABOUT CARBON EMISSIONS. >> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT CARBON EMISSIONS FOR A SECOND. >> LIGHT UP AND WE'LL HAVE --. >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'LL PUT THESE IN A SAFE PLACE. NOW YOU ARE THE ARCHBISHOP OF MIAMI. YOU SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE OF DOMESTIC JUSTICE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS THAT COVERS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. YOUR MOTTO IS ONNI OMINOUS, WHICH IS ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN THAT SOUNDS EXHAUSTING. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING ON THE U.S. COUNCIL OF -- U.S. CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE? >> WELL, WE'RE TRYING TO PROPAGATE THE MISSION, OR THE MESSAGE OF POPE FRANCIS. >> Stephen: THAT WAS A PAPAL ENCYCLICAL. WHAT DID HE SAY. >> HE BASICALLY SAID WE HAVE TO TALK. HE INVITES THE WORLD TO A DIALOGUE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF OUR COMMON HOME, WHICH IS THE EARTH. AND HE SAYS OUR TIME AT HOME IS IN A BIT OF DISREPAIRMENT AND HE SAYS WE HAVE TO GET THE RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO GET THE RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT WITH OUR-- WITH OUR EARTH, RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT WITH OUR FELLOW BROTHERS AND SISTERS, AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT WITH GOD. AND WHEN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BREAK DOWN IN ANY AREA, THEN WE'RE DER-- WE'RE IN HOT WATER. >> Stephen: RISING HOT WATER, ACTUALLY, IS WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR. IS THIS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO YOU AS THE ARCHBISHOP OF MIAMI TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING BECAUSE YOUR DIOCESE WILL DISAPPEAR EVENTUALLY. >> EVENTUALLY. AND WE ALREADY HAVE PROBLEMS ON MIAMI BEACH WITH THE KING TIDES AND MIAMI BEACH HAS PUT IN PUMPS TO PUMP OUT THE WATER SO THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO TO THOSE NIGHTCLUBS. CUZ OTHERWISE. >> Stephen: DO YOU EVER HIT THE CLUBS AT ALL? >> I DON'T. I JUST STAY HOME AND WATCH YOU ON TV. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WHAT ARE THE HYMNS LIKE AT CHURCHES IN MIAMI. IS IT LIKE THE KING OF GLORY COME--  ♪ ♪ ♪. >> WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE HYMNS IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. HAITIAN CREOLE IS VERY LIVELY MUSIC. >> Stephen: YOU SPEECH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. >> I THINK MY BEST LANGUAGE IS HAITIAN CREOLE BECAUSE I WORKED AS THE PARISH PRIEST IN THE HAITIAN COMMUNITY IN SOUTH FLORIDA BEFORE 18 YEARS BEFORE I BECAME A BISHOP AND WHEN I WAS IN THE SEMINARY I LEARNED SPANISH AND I LEARNED IT WELL ENOUGH THAT I HAVE A CUBAN ACCENT AND I CAN TELL PEOPLE, I CAN TELL CUBANS THAT I WAS BORN ON SUCH AND SUCH A STREET IN OLD HAVANA AND SOME WILL TELL ME THAT THEY KNEW MY UNCLE. >> Stephen: WOW, WOW. SO DO YOU LIE TO PEOPLE A LOT, ARCHBISHOP? >> WHATEVER I CAN GET AWAY WITH IT. >> Stephen: OKAY. WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR THE CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES TO HAVE A POPE THAT IS THIS POPULAR? PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED THAT HE IS HERE. I UNDERSTAND THE LAST YEAR WHEN YOU ALL GOT TOGETHER THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SORT OF GETTING SOME OF THE POPE'S MOJO. CAN CATHOLICS HAVE MOJO? IS THAT A SIN? >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK-- ANOTHER-- THEOLOGICAL WORD FOR MOJO MIGHT BE GRACE. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT. >> WE WANT TO SHARE THE GRACE OF THE HOLY FATHER, CERTAINLY HIS FOR THE CHURCH TODAY BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS A-- A NEW TONE IN THE CHURCH THAT, AS YOU SEE, PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE THE CHURCH ANOTHER LOOK OR ANOTHER LISTEN. >> Stephen: WHY DID THE POPE GO TO CUBA, DO YOU THINK? BECAUSE IT IS A COMMUNIST COUNTRY. OFFICIALLY IT'S AN ATHISTIC COUNTRY. >> IT IS NO LONGER OFFICIALLY ATHISTIC. IN THE EARLY 09s THE GOVERNMENT CHANGED THE CONSTITUTION SAYING IT IS NOT A SECULAR STATE OR-- STATE AND AT THAT POINT TOO, THAT IS WHEN THEY STARTED OPENING UP MORE TO RELIGION AND TO ALLOWING THE CHURCH TO GAIN MORE SPACE. BUT WHY DID THE POPE GO TO CUBA? THE SAME REASON I THINK WHY HE CAME HERE. IS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. BECAUSE IF WE CHANGE THE CULTURE, THEN WE CAN CHANGE THE POLITICS. BOTH IN CUBA AND IN HERE. SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND AS THE POPE SAID AT THE CONGRESS THIS MORNING, TO WORK TOGETHER, TO PROMOTE THE COMMON GOOD, AND IN SOLIDARITY. >> Stephen: ARCHBISHOP, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: ARCHBISHOP THOMAS WENSKI, EVERYBODY.
