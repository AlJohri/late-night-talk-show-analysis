AND TO HAVE THAT KIND OF-- ( APPLAUSE ) VOTING, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT'S TRADE AGREEMENTS, WHETHER OR NOT THE WAR, AND ESPECIALLY FOR ME BECAUSE I ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT GOING INTO IRAQ AND REALLY PAID A PRICE FOR IT. WHEN I SAW HIM STAND UP. AND IF YOU GOOGLE HIS SPEECH, IT'S JUST SO CLEAR AGAINST THE WAR. AT A TIME-- YOU KNOW, GAY RIGHTS, EVERYTHING, BEFORE IT BECAME EASY. HE'S ALWAYS THERE BEFORE IT BECOMES SIMPLE.

AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DISCUSS THE WHOLE PROCESS AND THE PLATFORM AND REALLY LISTEN TO PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE NOT NORMALLY LISTENING TO. >> Stephen: I'LL LISTEN TO-- ( APPLAUSE ). >> BECAUSE -- >> I WILL LISTEN TO ANYTHING YOU SAY IF YOU JUST KEEP HOLDING MY HAND THIS ENTIRE TIME. SO IF BERNIE LOSES-- >> I MIGHT GO THERE AND HOLD HANDS. >> Stephen: IF BERNIE IS NOT THE NOMINEE, WOULD YOU VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON? >> I'M NOT DEALING WITH THAT YET.  ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: WELL, YOU SAID-- IF I GET THIS RIGHT-- YOU SAID, "TRUMP MIGHT BRING THE REVOLUTION FASTER." WHAT ASK THAT MEAN? >> I SAID, "SOME PEOPLE SAY TRUMP MIGHT--" YOU KNOW, I'M MORE AFRAID OF ACTUALLY HILLARY CLINTON'S WAR RECORD AND HER HAWKISHNESS THAN I AM OF BUILDING A WALL. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP. AND I'M NOT SURE TRUMP'S GOING TO GET IT. I THINK ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS COULD HAPPEN AT THOSE CONVENTIONS. I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE COVERING THEM. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A WILD TIME. >> Stephen: I THINK WE DEFINITELY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THEM, WE DEFINITELY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THEM. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: IT PAYS THE RENT AROUND HERE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: SO YOU WOULDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP OVER HILLARY? >> OH, I MEAN, COME ON.

YOU'RE ALSO IN HARRY POTTER, YOU'RE A WELL-KNOWN SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR. IS IT THE SHAKESPEARE PEOPLE, THE DR. WHO PEOPLE, THE HARRY POTTER PEOPLE? WHO ARE THE MOST WILD EYED WHEN THEY MEET YOU? >> I PREFER TERM "ENTHUSIASTIC." I DON'T WANT TO CONDEMN PEOPLE TO FERVENT, FROTHY CRAZINESS. I THINK DR. WHO FANS GET A BAD RAP ON THAT FRONT. THEY'RE TERRIBLY INTELLIGENT, WONDERFUL PEOPLE, FRANKLY.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU SEE? YOU SEE. >> Stephen: I DIDN'T REALIZE PEOPLE FROM THE BRITISH ISLES COULD PANDER THAT WELL. BEAUTIFULLY DONE. YOU DON'T WANT TO CONDEMN ANYBODY. IT COULD SOUND GREAT TO BE CONDEMNED WITH THAT ACCENT OF YOURS. >> YOU THINK. >> Stephen: YOU COULD REALLY CURSE SOMEBODY OUT. >> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CONDEMN YOU. >> Stephen: PLEASE CONDEMN ME. >> THAT SOUNDS VAGUELY KINKY. >> Stephen: IT WOULD SOUND MEDIEVAL WHEN YOU YELL AT SOMEONE. >> I CAN DO MEDIEVAL YELLING. I'M IN A SHAKESPEARE PLAY. >> Stephen: YOU'RE RICHARD II. AND IT'S A SORT OF A LESSER KNOWN SHAKESPEARE PLAY. IT'S NOT PERFORMED ALL THAT MUCH BUT I LOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT A WEAK KING WHO IS DEPOSED. >> IT'S A LESSON IN HOW NOT TO LEAD A COUNTRY, YES. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO COULD LEARN FROM IT RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'S NOT THE GREATEST KING.

APRIL 23 WAS THE ANNIVERSARY. >> Stephen: AND WHY DO YOU THINK SHAKESPEARE IS STILL SO RESONANT TO US TODAY? WHY IS HE STILL IMPORTANT? >> BECAUSE HE HAS A WAY OF SAYING THINGS THAT HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER. HE'S GOT A WAY OF GETTING TO THE NUB OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING. AND HE SAYS IT BETTER THAN ANYONE HAS DONE SINCE, I THINK. >> Stephen: WELL, THERE ARE MANY PHRASES THAT ARE-- THEY'RE MODERN PHRASES BUT SHAKESPEARE INVENTED THEM, THEY APPEARED IN PLAYS. >> WORDS, WE RECKON HE MADE BUP 1700 WORDS. >> Stephen: JUST MADE THEM UP? >> YEAH, YEAH. >> Stephen: WOW. HE MADE UP "EATING ME OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME." "BE ALL AND END ALL" IS FROM "MACBETH." KILL WITH KINDNESS FROM THE TAMING OF THE SHREW. ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD "THE MERCHANT OF VENICE." IF HE WAS DOING STUFF TODAY, WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY RESIDUALS EVERY TIME WE USED ONE OF THOSE PHRASES. ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINKS SHAKESPEARE DIDN'T WRITE SHAKESPEARE GIDON'T REALLY CARE. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: I'LL WRITE THAT DOWN, NOT CARE. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: NOT CARE. SOME PEOPLE DO CARE A LOT, THOUGH? >> I KNOW SOME PEOPLE GET VERY, VERY EXERCISED ABOUT IT. AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT IT WAS THE DUKE OF SOMETHING OR THE-- YOU KNOW. THE WIDOW OF SOMEBODY ELSE. IT SORT OF DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT EXIST ARE THE PLAYS. WHOEVER WROTE THEM WAS OBVIOUSLY QUITE CLEVER. ( LAUGHTER ) AND HAS LEFT WITH US THESE BRILLIANT-- >> Stephen: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD HIDE THE FACT THAT YOU'D WRITTEN THESE BEAUTIFUL THINGS. >> NO! >> Stephen: WHAT IS THE MOTIVATION FOR GIVING THE CREDIT TO SOMEBODY ELSE? >> THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT IT WASN'T THE-- BECAUSE BEING A PLAYWRIGHT BACK THEN WAS NOT AN EXALTED PROFESSION. SO THERE IS A THEORY IF YOU'RE THE EARL OF DO-DA, OR DUKE OF HUFF-HUFFINGTON. >> Stephen: I HEAR THAT'S A LOVELY PART OF ENGLAND, HUFF-HUFFINGTON. >> MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIDE BEHIND SOME SORT OF LOCALLY ACTOR. THERE'S SOMETHING RATHER SNOBBISH ABOUT IT. >> Stephen: EXACTLY. THAT A COMMON MAN COULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THIS STUFF. >> DIDN'T HAVE THE BRAINPOWER. >> Stephen: ARE YOU COMMON? >> I'M AS COMMON AS MOCK NO, I'M FR SCOTLAND. >> Stephen: THEY DON'T HAVE FANCY PEOPLE IN SCOTLAND? >> VERY, VERY FEW.
