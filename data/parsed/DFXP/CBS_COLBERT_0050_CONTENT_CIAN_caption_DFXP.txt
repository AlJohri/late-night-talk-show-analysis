BUT ONE LAST THING, JON, DID YOU CATCH THE FORD ECOBOOST 400 NASCAR RACE YESTERDAY? >> Jon: NO. >> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T CATCH THAT? >> Jon: I DIDN'T CATCH IT. >> Stephen: YOU DIDN'T CATCH IT, IT WAS GREAT. I PERSONALLY CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING 200 MILES AN HOUR RIGHT ON SOMEBODY'S BUMPER. PLUS WITH THE GPS GOING THE WHOLE TIME, FOLLOW THE HIGHLIGHTED ROUTE N1700 FEET, TURN LEFT, THEN TURN LEFT. CONTINUE, TURNING LEFT. ANYWAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID NOT SEE IT, KYLE BUSCH STORMED FROM BEHIND TO WIN LAST SEVEN LAPS THUS DEFEATING THREE OTHER CHAMPIONSHIP CONTENDERS TO BRING HOME THE 2015 NASCAR SPRINT CUP.

HEY, EVERYBODY. >> CHEERS PLAWSES-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: LET THE GAMES BEGIN. >> STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. THANKS SO MUCH. THANKS, JON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: HEY, Y'ALL, I'M NOT SURE IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR BUT IT'S ALREADY NOVEMBER 23rd. WHICH MEANS WE'RE ONLY THREE DAYS AWAY FROM THANGSZ GIVING. THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THE HOST IS ALWAYS IN CHARGE OF, AND THAT'S THE TURKEY. YOU GOT TO GET UP BEFORE DAWN TO DE-BRINE IT, GIVE IT A DEEP SENSE YUS BUTTER SHIATSU AND REMEMBER IF YOU PUT THE STUFFING INSIDE THE BIRD THERE IS A RISK OF SALMONELLA SO SO REMEMBER PUT THE STUFFING INSIDE THE BIRD. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED STUFFING. ROLL THE BONES, LIVE ON A HIGH WIRE. STUFFING ON THE SIDE IS NOT STUFFING, UNLESS IT'S STOF TOP STUFFING, ONE OF OUR SPONSORS. STOVE TOP, EAT IT. AND I GOT TO TELL YOU THIS THANKSGIVING I'M FEELING A LITTLE BETRAYED BECAUSE IT HAS JUST BEEN REVEALED THAT THE GROTION REE STORE LABELS ON THE TURKEY MEAN VERY LITTLE. FRESH, YOUNG, NATURAL, MEANINGLESS. BY THE WAY, I GOGGLED FRERN, YOUNG, NATURAL-- FRESH, YOUNG, NATURAL AND I-- I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE AT CBS HUMAN RESOURCES. I UNDERSTAND THAT I VIOLATED COMPANY POLICY AND IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. APPARENTLY FRESH TURKEY JUST MEANS IT'S NOT FULLY FROZEN. YOUNG TURKEY MEANS THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DIE OF OLD AGE. NATURAL TURKEY HAS THE SAME LEGAL STANDING AS CHEEZ WITH TWO Es AND A Zs AND WILD TURKEY MEANS YOU'RE TOO DRUNK TO CARE ANY MORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE POINT IS IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY ONES YOU CAN TRUST THESE DAYS ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE AT BUTTERBALL. THEY'RE ALL ABOUT HELPING YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR TURKEY. IN FACT, BUTTERBALL'S BEEN RUNNING A TOLL FREE HOTLINE FOR TURKEY-COOKING TIPS SINCE 1981. THE MOST COMMONLY ASKED QUESTION, HOW DO I THA-W MY TURKEY? OF COURSE BACK IN 1981 THE ANSWER WAS WITH A PAIR OF LEG WARMERS. (LAUGHTER) EVERY YEAR THE TURKEY TALK LINE RECEIVES MORE THAN 100,000 PHONE CALLS, BUT SADLY, THEY HAVE NOT ONCE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE THE TURKEY'S LIFE. (LAUGHTER) AND WHILE THE HOTLINE OPENS ON NOVEMBER 2nd, NOT SURPRISINGLY THE VOLUME PEAKS ON THANKSGIVING DAYMENT SO RIGHT NOW, BUTTERBALL IS PAYING TURKEY EXPERTS TO SIT BY THE PHONE. BUT NO ONE IS CALLING. SO TO GIVE THOSE NICE TALK LINE OPERATORS SOMETHING TO DO, THIS MORNING I CALLED THE BUTTERBALL HOTLINE. (APPLAUSE) AND I ASKED THEM SOME OF THE URGENT TURKEY QUESTIONS ON MY MIND. THIS IS. >> THE LATE SHOW PRESENTS THANKSGIVING TURKEY TIPS WITH OUR FRIENDS AT BUTTERBALL. FIRST THING'S FIRST. I CALLED THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY TIP HOTLINE. >> BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK LINE, NICOLE SPEAK, HOW CAN I HELP YOU. >> Stephen: HEY, NICOLE, THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT FROM THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. >> WELL, HI, STEPHEN, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? >> Stephen: I'M DOING FINE, HOW ARE YOU, NICOLE. >> WE ARE FANTASTIC. >> Stephen: I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT MY TURKEY, COULD YOU HELP ME WITH THAT? >> ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO THA-W THIS THING OUT. >> GREAT QUESTION. THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION WE GET YEAR AFTER YEAR. >> Stephen: I GOT MINE IN THE GARAGE IN A HEFTY BAG AND I POURED IT IN A JUG OF ANTIFREEZE. >> OH PIE GOODNESS, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T RECOMMEND THAT. >> Stephen: THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. >> ALL RIGHT, THANKS, STEPHEN, HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> Stephen: BYE, YOU TOO. HI, TURKEY TALK LINE, WHO IS THIS? >> THIS IS CHEF TONY, HOW MAY I HELP YOU? >> Stephen: IS THAT YOUR NAME OR IS CHEF YOUR TIGHT EL. >> CHEF'S MY TITLE AND TONY IS MY FIRST NAME, YES. >> Stephen: I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, TONY. >> YES. >> Stephen: I GOT A NEPHEW WHO WANTS ME TO TAKE TOFU RKEY THIS YEAR, WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO LET HIM KNOW HE'S NO LONGER WELCOME IN MY HOUSE. >> HE WANTS TO DO A VEGAN STYLE TURKEY. >> Stephen: HE DOES. >> THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. >> Stephen: HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE THERE, ARE YOU ALL IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER? >> WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME ROOM THERE ARE FIVE OF US. >> Stephen: TONY, IF YOU ARE BEING HELD AGAINST YOUR WILL, JUST SAY, HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> Stephen: OKAY, I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND, LOUD AND CLEAR, WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMEONE TO YOU RIGHT AWAY. STAY WHERE YOU ARE, TONY, DON'T GO, STAY STRONG. >> BUTTERBALL TURKEY HOTLINE, THIS IS JANET. >> Stephen: JANET. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: HI, I PLAN TO SERVE MY TURKEY WITH SOME CRANBERRY SAUCE WHICH I LIKE WITH A HINT OF ORANGE GLES AND RED WIEFNLT THE THING IS MY KIDS LIKE IT PLAIN. SO SHOULD I SERVE BOTH KINDS OR SHOULD I LEAVE MY FAMILY AND MOVE TO BARCELONA AND PURSUE MY DREAM OF BEING A DANCER. >> I WOULD PROBABLY START WITH LEAVING THE WINE OUT OF CRANBERRY FIRST AND GO AHEAD AND ADD THAT LATER. >> Stephen: SO SERVE IT WITHOUT THE WINE TO THE KIDS AND ADD IT FOR ME. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: WITH THE WINE UH-HUH. >> ABSOLUTELY. >> Stephen: I LIKE TO TACK A PACKET OF ORANGE LIMB-U M-AID AND POUR IT UP UP SID DOWN AND POUR IT IN A POT ELF PINOT GRIJ YO AND PUT A NIPPLE ON IT AND CRAWL INTO A CORNER. >> YOU KNOW, WHATEVER WORKS. >> Stephen: HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO YOU TOO. >> HI THIS IS THE TURKEY TALK LINE, HOW CAN I HELP YOU. >> Stephen: FILLIST. >> YES. >> Stephen: IT IS STEPHEN COLBERT FROM THE LATE SHOW. >> HOW ARE YOU. >> Stephen: I'M DOING FINE, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? >> WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. WE'RE TALKING TURKEY HERE. >> Stephen: LET'S TALK TURKEY. HERE IS HOW I PREPARE MY TURKEY. I HAVE DEEP UNRESOLVED FEELINGS OF RAGE. AND I, THEY COME OUT WHEN I-BASE THE TURKEY. I DO WHAT I CALL HATE BASTING WHERE I JAB IT WITH THE BASTER AND PRETEND IT IS THE FACE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WRONGED ME. HERE IS MY QUESTION, WILL THAT FLAVOR COME OUT IN THE TURKEY? >> WELL, WE ARE IN COOKING LINE, YET EXDRK DSH EXPERTS. >> Stephen: AS LONGS I HAVE GOT YOU ON THE PHONE THOUGH, DON'T YOU EVER NEED TO LET OFF SOME STEAM. >> YOU BET YOU, YES. >> Stephen: HALLOWEEN IS EASY BECAUSE HAVE I DONE SOME UNSPEAKABLE THINGS TO A UMP PUMPKIN. >> OH, REALLY, CAN I IMAGINE YOU DO THAT. BUT WHY DON'T YOU JUST BE GOOD TO THE TURKEY THIS YEAR. >> Stephen: THANKS VERY MUCH, HAPPY THANKSGIVING. SAY I HAD TO TONY. BYE. >> GOOD AFTERNOON, TURKEY TALK LINE, CHEF TONY, HOW MAY I HELP YOU. >> Stephen: IT'S STEPHEN AGAIN, HOW DO I DEEP FRY MY TURKEY WITHOUT CATCHING MY HOUSE ON FIRE AND AS A QUICK FOLLOWUP QUESTION, CAN YOU CONNECT ME TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT? >> DON'T PUT A WET TURKEY IN HOT FAT. >> Stephen: NEVER FRY A WET TURKEY. >> NEVER FRY A WET TURKEY IN HOT OIL. >> CORRECT. >> Stephen: OKAY. STAY STRONG, TONY, AGAIN, HAPPY THANKSGIVING? HAPPY THANKSGIVING? >> HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> Stephen: YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART, TONY. WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE. >> THIS HAS BEEN THANKSGIVING TURKEY TIPS WITH OUR FRIENDS AT BUTTERBALL. >> Stephen: WE'LL HAVE SOME MORE TURKEY TIPS LATER ON IN THE SHOW. NOW STICK AROUND FOR SYLVESTER STALLONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, MY FIRST GES TONIGHT IS A WRITER AND STAR OF THE ROCKY, RAMBO AND EXPENDABLES FILMS. THIS WEEK HE RETURNS TO HIS ICONIC ROLE PLAYING ROCKY BALBOA IN THE FILM "CREED." >> EVERYTHING I'VE GOT HAS MOVED ON. AND I'M HERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S OKAY. CUZ I SAID TO MYSELF IF I BREAK, IF I'M HURT, WHATEVER. I AIN'T GOING TO FIX IT. WHY BOTHER. >> I'M JUST SOME BUM LIVING IN YOUR CRIB, JUST NOTHING. >> YOU'RE A GOOD KID, A GOOD FIGHTER. BUT YOU GOT YOUR WHOLE FUTURE AHEAD OF YOU. MINE? THAT'S LIKE ONE OF THEM GUYS ON THAT WALL. IN THE BACK. IN THE PAST. >> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME SYLVESTER STALLONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT ANSWER SHE JUST DID. >> OH REALLY? >> Stephen:S NO EVERY GUEST TAKES THE TIME TO DO A LITTLE VICTORY LAP BEFORE THEY COME UP ON STAGE. >> THEY COULDN'T SEE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S YOUR BIGGEST THRILL, YOU COME OUT, YOU DO A FLOP. >> Stephen: OH, YEAH. >> YOU CAN FIX EVERYTHING WITH EDITING? >> REALLY? >> Stephen: YEAH. >> LET ME TRY IT AGAIN. >> Stephen: THAT YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> IT'S MY PLEASURE, REALLY. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE FILM "ROCKY" KNOW YOU FROM THAT. PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW, NAI MOT REMEMBER THAT WON THE FILM FOR BEST FILM-- THE OSCAR FOR BEST FILM. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: YOU WERE NOMINATED FOR WRITING THE SCREENPLAY AND AGOING THAT YEAR, ONLY TWO OTHER PEOPLE, CHARLIE CHAP LYNN AND OR SON WELLS HAVE EVER BEEN NOMINATED IN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES IN THE SAME YEAR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE BREAKOUT YEAR FOR YOU. >> IT REALLY WAS. >> Stephen: AND NOW 40 YEARS LATER HERE ARE YOU PLAYING ROCKY BALBOA AGAIN, TRAINING MICHAEL B JORDAN WHO PLAY AS POLO CREED'S SON AND THE REVIEWS ARE EXTRAORDINARY. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE LOVED FOR PLAYING ROCKY NOW HERE 40 YEARS LATER? >> IT'S THE GREATEST GIFT. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CLICHE AND TRITE BUT AT ONE TIME I THOUGHT, YOU WANT TO JUST BE REMEMBERED AS THIS MAIN CHARACTER. AND THEN AS I GOT OLDER, I SAID WHAT A PRIVILEGE TO BE ABLE TO DO. THIS AND TO BE ABLE TO CARRY ON FOR SO LONG AND THEN TO HAVE A COUPLE OF YOUNG FILMMAKERS, 27 YEARS OLD, COME IN AND FIND NEW LIFE IN THE MOVIE. ROCKY STORY HAS BASICALLY BEEN TOLD. BUT NOW CREED, MICHAEL B JORDAN AND DIRECTOR RYAN COUGAR HAVE CREATED AN ENTIRELY NEW-- I WOULDN'T SAY BEGINNING OF A SERIES BUT A CHARACTER THAT REALLY SPEAKS FOR TODAY'S YOUTH, AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. WHEREAS I SPOKE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, YOU KNOW, WAY BACK, ABBE LINCOLN WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH. >> Stephen: BUT YOU WERE STRUGGLING. WERE YOU A LITTLE BIT LIKE ROCKY BECAUSE WERE YOU STRUGGLING. YOU DIDN'T HAVE A DIME TO YOUR NAME. YOU WERE OFFERED $300,000 TO SELL THE SCRIPT TO ROCKY. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE BE IN THE ROLL. YOU SAID NO, IT HAS TO BE ME. WHY DID THAT STORY SO IMPORTANT TO YOU YRK DID YOU WRITE IT? >> YOU HAVE A FEW CROSS ROADS IN YOUR LIFE AND I JUST REALIZED IF I WAS EVER GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR AT LEAST TRUE TO MY DREAMS, THIS IS THE PART. BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS BEING CAST AS KIND OF THE HEAVY. I WAS THE ONE THAT WAS MUG JACK LEMON, MUG WOODY ALLEN. I WAS THE MUGGER. I MUGGED K O.J. AK. I THOUGHT OKAY Y DON'T I TAKE A CHARACTER WHO IS KIND OF A MUGGER, A, YOU A LOAN SHARK BUT HE ALSO HAS A LOT INSIDE THAT NO ONE HAS REALLY SEEN BEFORE SO YOU COMBINE THE TWO AND OUT CAME ROCKY. >> Stephen: WELL, WAS IT HARD TO CONVINCE, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE PUTTING UP THE MONEY THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE PERSON PLAYING. >> OH MY GOSH. >> Stephen: HOY ABOUT THE REST OF THE CAST DID THEY HAVE ANY DOUBTS IN YOU? >> 100%. I DOUBTED MYSELF, SURE. ARE YOU KIDDING?  THEY SAID BASICALLY OVER OUR DEAD BODY. WE GOT THIS CHARACTER, BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, YOU HAD A LOT OF YOUNG ACTORS WHO WERE ENERGETIC, JIMMY CAAN, BURT REYNOLDS, RYAN O'NEAL, EVERYONE FANCIED THEMSELVES AS A FIGHTER. AND THEY SAID WHO IS THAT GUY WITH A CROOKED MOUTH AND DREEPY-- NO, FORGET HIM. HE LOOKS LIKE A HEAVY BAG, YOU KNOW. LEAVE HIM. HE COULD BE USED IN THE GYM SCENE, YOU CAN PUNCH HIM, THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT. BUT AGAIN, IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT COULD HAPPEN TODAY BECAUSE REALLY I WAS NOT QUALIFIED, IF YOU LOOK ON PAPER. IT WAS A TERRIBLE CHOICE THEY MADE. I JUST GOT LUCKY. >> Stephen: NOW WERE YOU-- DID CARL WEATHERS, HAD YOU KNOWN HIM BEFORE? >> NO, NO, NO. WHAT HAPPENED CARL WEATHERS. >> Stephen: THE ORIGINAL APOLLO CREED. >> HE WAS FANTASTIC IN IT. BUT WE HAD CAST A FIGHTER NAMED KEN NORTON WHO HAS THE DISTINCTION OF ACTUALLY FIGHTING MUHAMMAD ALI TWO TIMES AND BREAKING HIS JAW, SO HE WAS BIG. HE WAS SO BIG THAT I-- I THOUGHT IT WAS A SNAKE CHASING HIM, IT WAS A VEIN IN HIS ARM. HE COULD LITERALLY SEE VEINS. SO THE DAY TWO DAYS, THREE DAYS BEFORE FILMING HE GOES I DECIDED, I CHANGED MY MIND. I'M GOING TO ENTER THE ABC SUPERSTAR COMPETITION IN THE BICYCLE RACENESS I GO YOU'RE KIDDING ME. I SAID YOU DON'T HAVE 250 POUND BICYCLE GUYS. BUT HE LEFT. SO THEY MADE AN EMERGENCY PHONE CALL FOR ANYONE WHO COULD SORT OF FIT THE PART. AND HE WAS LIVING IN OAKLAND. HE WAS AN OAKLAND RAIDER. HE GETS ON AN AIRPLANE, COMES DOWN, IS HE IN A BAD MOOD, CARL WAS. AND HE COMES IN, I'M SITTING THERE, SAWL SLUMPED DOWN, HE GOES SHOW ME THE SCRIPT. I GO OKAY. AND HE HAS THIS BIG VOICE AND THE DIRECTOR GOES WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP WITH ME AND SEE IF YOU CAN MOVE AROUND. HE SLAPPED ME-- LIKE, I GO, DAMN. AND HE'S HUGE. AND THEN HE SAY YS DON'T YOU TWO READ A SCENE. AND HE READS THE SCENE, HE GOES, TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I COULD DO A LOT BETTER IF YOU GAVE ME A REAL ACTOR TO WORK WITH. >> Stephen: WAIT, DOES HE KNOW YOU'RE PLAYING ROCKY? >> NO, NO. >> Stephen: HE THINKS ARE YOU JUST. >> HE THINKS I'M THERE TO CLEAN UP. AND I THOUGHT, PERFECT. HIRE HIM. HE'S PERFECT. >> Stephen: WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK. REQUEST YOU STICK AROUND. I WOULD LOVE TO TALK SOME MORE. >> SURE. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE. >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH SYLVESTER STALLONE. WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT KNOWN AS ROCKY, YOU GOT KNOWN AS THE GUY WITH THE BIG MUSCLES. WERE THERE SOME PARTS THAT YOU WANTED TO GO OUT FOR, THEY WERE LIKE NO, NO, NO. THAT IS NOT A PART FOR ROCKY. >> NO, YES, THERE WERE MANY PARENTS-- PARTS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I WANT TO BE, LIKE CAN YOU BE THE BOOK SELLER IN NOTING HILL, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THAT. REALLY, I WANTED-- COULD YOU PLAY LIKE A SCHOOL TEACHER IN SOMETHING, NOT WAS IT, THE ONE LIKE PETER O'TOOLE DID, MR. CHIPS. YOU KNOW, MR. CHIPS 12, YOU KNOW. SO WHY DON'T YOU PLAY A MUGGER. I GO OKAY. >> Stephen: BACK TO SQUARE ONE. >> I GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE. I HOW ABOUT THIS CHARACTER NAMED RAMBO. SO I REALIZED, THE THING IS-- I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS THE 11th CHOICE. EVERYONE WAS AWAY. THEY-- RAN AWAY FROM RAMBO. >> Stephen: WHO. >> NICK NOLTE. STEVE McQUEEN, DE NIRO, PA CHINO, I'M TELLING YOU, JIMMY CAAN, IT GOT DOWN TO ZIPPY THE MONKEY AND THEN SLY. >> Stephen: BESIDES BEING AN ACTOR, YOU KNOW, AS I SAID, YOU WERE ALSO NOMINATED FOR BEST SCREENPLAY. YOU STARTED OFF WRITING YOUR OWN STUFF. DID YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS A WRITER. >> NO, NO, NO. AND I TELL PEOPLE THIS, THAT I WAS NOT EXACTLY, WHAT YOU CALL, I WAS NOT EDGAR ALLEN POE AS A STUDENT. BUT I LEARNED THAT I WAS NOT DOING WELL AS AN ACTOR, PERHAPS NEVER EVEN GOING TO MAKE IT AS AN ACTOR. SO AT LEAST TRY SOME OTHER AVENUE. SO I KEPT ALL THESE THOUGHTS INSIDE IN ALL MY DOWN TIME. I LITERALLY WOULD WRITE OR GO IT THE MOVIES WITH A TAPE RECORDER, TAPE RECORD WHAT WAS BEING PLAYED AT THE TIME, LET'S SAY IT WAS EASY RIDER, AND THEN LISTEN IT AND THEN TRY TO REWRITE THE SCRIPT WITH USING DIFFERENT WORDS, LIKE PLAY GAMES. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> AND I JUST LEARNED HOW TO WRITE SCREENPLAYS. >> Stephen: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. LIKE TEACHING YOURSELF TO PLAY A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. >> I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO. >> Stephen: YOU'RE ALSO, PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THIS. ARE YOU ALSO A PAINTER. >> A PAINTER. >> Stephen: THIS IS SOME OF YOUR WORK. THIS IS-- THIS IS, OF COURSE, YOU AS ROCKY AND WHAT IS THIS OVER HERE. >> THIS IS WHAT ROCKY REALLY LOOKS LIKE AFTER A FIGHT. THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE, LIKE THIS IS A GLAMOROUS JOB BUT AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, IT'S NOT GLARYMOUS, IT IS VERY PAINFUL, LONELY EXPERIENCE. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE GOTTEN MORE AN STRAK WITH YOUR WORK OVER THE YEARS. >> YES. >> Stephen: LET'S PUT UP THIS ONE. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE RIGHT HERE. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: THAT SAY GORGEOUS PIECE, DOES IT HAVE A NAME OR STORY BEHIND IT. >> IT IS WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE. I'M NOT SAYING THAT-- IT'S A KIDNEY STONE WITH A RABBIT. AND WHAT IT IS, AS YOU GET MORE AND MORE INTO PAINTING AND YOU START TO FOCUS ON THE ABSTRACT, YOU LEAVE TO THE VIEWER THE RIGHT TO MAKE UP ITS OWN DECISION. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CHILD LIKE FEELING THAT THE MORE AND MORE PAINT, THE MORE SIM POLICE PARTICULAR YOU TRY TO BECOME AND YOU LEAVE MORE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION, INSTEAD OF BEING SO LITERAL. >> Stephen: YOU ARE DEEP, SYLVESTER STALLONE. >> I ALMOST PUT MYSELF TO SLEEP. THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: "CREED" IS IN THEATER THIS WEDNESDAY. SYLVESTER STALLONE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK, FOLKS. YOU KNOW, AS YOU WATCH THIS, IT IS AFTER MIDNIGHT. MEANING THERE ARE NOW ONLY TWO DAYS UNTIL THANKSGIVING. MAKING IT ALL THE MORE URGENT TO GET THANKSGIVING TURKEY TIPS WITH OUR FRIENDS AT BUTTERBALL. THIS IS. >> THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION OF THANKSGIVING TURKEY TIPS WITH OUR FRIENDS AT BUTTERBALL. >> THANK YOU FOR CALLING THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY CHAT LINE, THIS IS CHRISTOPHER, HOW CAN I HELP YOU. >> Stephen: CHRISTOPHER, THIS IS STEPHEN COLBERT. IF I'M RUNNING SHORT ON TURKEY CAN I JUST BREAK INTO A BOSTON MARKET, STEEL ONE OF THE ROTISSERIE CHICKENSK BRING IT HOME AND TELL EVERYONE THAT OOPS TKS SHA RANK? >> WELL, YOU KNOW THAT TURKEY IS NOT CHICKEN. >> Stephen: I'M PRETTY SURE CHICKENS ARE BABY TURKEYS. >> YOU KNOW THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT BIRDS. >> Stephen: OKAY. I'M IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND I'M DATING A GUY WHO WALKING AROUND WITH A BIG HOODIE AND A MINI STEREO THAT BLASTS REGGAE SONGS. IN CERTAIN WAYS I'M ASHAMED OF HIM AND EVEN REPULSED BY HIM BUT OUR SEXUAL CHEMISTRY IS LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED AND SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS I FEEL LIKE I'M ALIVE. MY QUESTION IS SHOULD I TENT THE BIRD WITH FOIL OR LET IT ROAST UNCOVERED. >> THE WAY WE ROAST IS A TURKEY IS BY COOKING IT UNCOVERED FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE COOK TIME AND AS SOON AS IT STARTS TO SMELL LIKE THANKS GIVING PULL OUT A PIECE OF FOIL, FOLD IT IN HALF, MAKE A TENT AND TENT IT RIGHT OVER THE BREAST. >> Stephen: I DIDN'T CATCH ALL OF THAT BUT I ASSUME I'M SUPPOSED TO PUT FOIL ON IT FOR SOME PERIOD. >> THIS IS NICOLE WITH THE BUTTERBALL TURKEY HOTLINE. >> Stephen: NICOLE, THANK GOD. >> HELLO AGAIN. >> Stephen: I'M TRYING TO DO A TU RDUCKEN THIS YEAR AND I'M TRYING TO GET THE DUCK INTO THE TURKEY. BUT THE TURKEY IS HAVING NONE OF IT. IT KEEPS RUN AWAY. I GOT THE CHICKEN INTO THE DUCK AND THE DUCK DOESN'T SEEM HAPPY ABOUT THAT EITHER. IT'S WALKING FUNNY. >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HELP YOU THERE. I COULD HELP YOU WITH YOUR STUFFING QUESTIONS. >> Stephen: I'M STUFFING THE TURKEY IN A SPECIAL WAY THIS YEAR BEFORE I SHIP IT TO A FRIEND. I PUT THE STUFFING IN THE INDIVIDUAL BALLOONS BEFORE I INSERT THEM IN THE TURKEY'S BODY KAFFITY. MY QUESTION IS, ARE YOU A COP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF YOU'RE A COP OR ELSE THIS IS ENTRAPMENT. ALSO CAN POLICE DOGS SMELL THROUGH TURKEY MEAT? >> YOU KNOW, THEY PROBABLY COULD AND I CAN ASSURE YOU I'M DEFINITELY NOT A POLICE OFFICER. WE HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE, THAT IS SOMETHING NEW. >> Stephen: YEAH. YEAH. OKAY. THANKS SO MUCH, NICOLE. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. >> ALL RIGHT, HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK LINE, THIS IS SHARLa. >> Stephen: IS IT BABY IN THE BAS INETTE AND TURKEY IN THE OVEN BECAUSE I'M BABYSITTING HERE AND I'VE SMOKED SMOKED A FAIR AMOUNT OF PCP. >> I THINK YOU JUST WANT TO FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIONS. >> Stephen: FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIONS. >> WITH THAT TURKEY. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT. >> BUTTERBALL TURKEY TALK LINE. THIS IS ALICE. >> Stephen: HI, ALICE, THIS IS STEPHEN FROM THE LATE SHOW. HOW ARE YOU? >> I'M FINE. HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> Stephen: HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO YOU TOO. WHAT SIZE TURKEY WOULD YOU RECOMMEND FOR 47 PEOPLE? >> I WOULD RECOMMEND ABOUT A POUND PER PERSON. >> Stephen: A POUND PER PERSON SO 47 POUND TURKEY. >> NO, NO, WOULD YOU HAVE TO BUY SEVERAL TURKEYS. >> Stephen: I ONLY WANT TO BUY ONE BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTIER ON THE TABLE. >> YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TURKEY TO PASS AROUND. >> Stephen: HEY, ALICE, I ENJOY A C KROWTON-BASED STUFFING BUT MY SISTER-IN-LAW ENJOYS CRACK COCANE AT ALL TIMES OF YEAR, DO I STILL HAVE TO INVITE HER TO DINNER. >> OH DEAR, NO, I THINK YOU CAN CHOOSE WHOEVER YOU WANT TO INVITE TO THANKSGIVING DINNER, THAT IS YOUR CHOICE. >> Stephen: WHOEVER I WANT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAPPY THANKSGIVING. >> HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO YOU. >> THIS HAS BEEN THANKSGIVING TURKEY TIPS WITH OUR FRIENDS AT BUTTERBALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH TED KOPPEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST WAS THE HOST OF "NIGHTLINE" FOR 29 YEARS AN ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED JOURNALISTS OF OUR TIME. PLEASE WELCOME TED KOPPEL. (APPLAUSE) >> 50 SHOWS, HAS JON EVER WORN THE SAME SUIT TWICE? >> Stephen: NOORKS I DON'T THINK HE HAS WORN THE SAME SHOES TWICE AM YOU HAVE WON EIGHT PEABODY AWARDS, 11 OVERSEAS PRESS CLUB AWARDS 4-RBGS 2 EMMYS, MANAGING EDITOR OF THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL, NEWS ANALYST FOR BBC AMERICA, A COMMENT ATER RIGHT NOW ON NPR. AS SOMEONE WHO IS BEEN IN JOURNALISM FOR A LONG TIME, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE STATE OF TODAY'S JOURNALISM? HOW IS IT DOING? AND PLEASE GIVE YOUR ANSWER IN THE FORM OF A LIST OF 17 CASTS THAT LOOK LIKE WORLD LEADERS. >> WELL, WE'VE GOT MAOSE, DUNG, THE STATE OF JOURNALISM WE ARE SO FRAGMENTED NOW, WE HAVE SO MUCH JOURNALISM. EVERYONE IS IN COMPETITION FOR A TINY LITTLE FRAGMENT OF THE AUDIENCE. AND WHEREAS 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO WE USED TO BE IN COMPETITION TO TRY AND GIVE PEOPLE THE NEWS THAT THEY NEED, NOW WE'RE IN COMPETITION TO GIVE PEOPLE THE NEWS THAT THEY WANT. AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU END UP DOING MORE SERIOUS STUDIES OF SERIOUS SUBJECTS IN A FUNNY WAY. THAN NEWS PEOPLE. >> Stephen: TRYING TO GET ME FIERD, TED? >> NO! >> Stephen: WELL, YOU'VE DONE A SERIOUS STUDY IN YOUR NEW BOOK, IT'S CALLED LIGHTS OUT. >> WE WERE ABOUT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE COLBERT BUMP STILL WORKS. >> Stephen: OH.

LIGHTS OUT "THIS IS ABOUT THE POWER GRID OR THE HACK ABILITY OF AMERICA'S POWER GRID. >> IT IS. >> Stephen: BEFORE WE GET STARTED, WHEN WE SAY POWER GRID, WHAT DO WE MEAN S THERE ONE GRID OF POWER ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. >> NO, THERE ARE THREE POWER GRIDS. THE EASTERN INTERCONNECT WHICH GOES FROM THE EAST COAST PAST CHICAGO. MORE THAN A HUNDRED PEOPLE PEOPLE COVERED BY IT. TEXAS HAS ITS OWN POWER GRID, THE WEST COAST HAS ITS OWN POWER. >> Stephen: TEXT HAS-- TEXAS HAS ITS OWN-- WHAT ARE THEY PLAYING, TED? >> TEXAS HAS ITS OWN POWER GRID. >> Stephen: THEY'RE READY TO CUT US LOOSE AT ANY MOMENT. SO WHAT COULD HAPPEN, SOMEONE COULD HACK THE POWER GRID, HOW WOULD THEY DO THAT? >> NOT SOMEONE. THE CHINESE COULD, THE RUSSIANS COULD. THEY ARE ALREADY IN THE POWER GRID. THE INTERNET IN EFFECT RUNS-- WE HAVE 3200 POWER COMPANIES IN THIS COUNTRY. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. >> WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS GENERATED AND THE AM OF ELECTRICITY THAT IS USED. ONLY THE INTERNET CAN DO THAT. THE INTERNET CANNOT BE PERFECTLY DEFENDED SO THE INTERNET IS VULNERABILITY-- VULNERABLE, OUR POWER GRID IS VULNERABLE. THE CHINESE COULD TAKE IT OUT. THE RUSSIANS COULD TAKE IT OUT. THEY PROBABLY WON'T. BUT IRAN IS GETTING BETTER AT IT. NORTH KOREA IS GETTING BETTER AT IT. AND MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL, ISIS. THEY HAVE THE MONEY, YOU KNOW. WHILE WE ARE WORRYING ABOUT ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE THREATS, THINGS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN PARIS, THE GREATEST DANGER OF ALL IS THAT THEY CAN ATTACK OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT EVER COMING. >> Stephen: SO WHAT IS THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO? POWER GRID GOES DOWN, LET'S SAY THE EASTERN POWER GRID GOES DOWN. HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING. >> UP TO MONTHS. COULD BE MONTHS. YOU COULD HAVE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY FOR A PERIOD OF MONTHS. IT IS-- IT IS BEYOND IMAGINABLE. >> Stephen: SO IT WOULD BE RESTORING US TO A 19th CENTURY ECONOMY. SHOULD I BUY A BUTTER CHURN, TED KOPPEL? >> THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD ALSO BUY A OIL LAMP. >> Stephen: I ALREADY HAVE A WHALE BONE CORRETTE. WHAT CAN WE DO. ARE THERE ANY ANSWERS IN HERE OR IS THIS JUST SOMETHING TO MAKE ME SO PAINGED THAT I READ IT AND SET MYSELF ON FIRE. WHAT IS-- ARE THERE ANSWERS IN HERE? >> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS IN THERE. WHAT I'M REALLY HOPING, STEPHEN, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, RIGHT. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED. IT SHOULDN'T BE A DEMOCRATIC ISSUE, IT SHOULDN'T BE A REPUBLICAN OR CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL ISSUE. IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT IT, WE'RE CREATIVE PEOPLE. WE WILL FIND ANSWERS. >> Stephen: THERE IS THERE A CANDIDATE OUT THERE WHO IS RUNNING THIS YEAR WHO YOU THINK CARES OR IS WILLING TO BRING UP SOMETHING LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE? >> WELL, JIM WEBB IN FACT BROUGHT IT UP AT ONE OF THE DELATE-- DEBATES AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO JIM WEBB. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. WHAT HAPPENED TO JIM WEBB IS THAT WE NO LONGER KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO JIM WEBB. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. >> Stephen: IT'S TOO BAD. IS HE A GOOD MAN. BUT OKAY, YOU HAVE COVERED EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SINCE 1964. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS ONE? >> WELL, I'M GOING TO RESORT TO THAT GREAT STATESMAN WINSTON CHURCH IL WHO ONCE SAID THE AMERICANS WILL ALWAYS END UP DOING THE RIGHT THING. BUT ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED EVERY OTHER POSSIBILITY. (LAUGHTER). >> Stephen: WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. TED, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: TED KOPPEL'S BOOK, LIGHTS' OUT IS AVAILABLE NOW WHEREVER BOOKS ARE SOLD. AND IT JUST GOT THE COLBERT BUMP. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 7 >> Stephen: HERE WITH THE SONG "TROPICS," LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY MORNING JACKET.
