AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: OH BOY, OH BOY. THIS FEELS GOOD. THIS FEELS RIGHT. IT'S REALLY LOVELY TO BE HERE WITH YOU GUYS. ALSO SITTING, SITTING FEELS GOOD TOO. HOW WAS YOUR BREAK, JON? DID YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE? >> Jon: YEAH, I HAD A GOT OLD BREAK. >> Stephen: WHAT DID YOU DO? >> Jon: I DID MY THING, I WAS HANGING OUT. YOU KNOW I WENT TO THE GIANTS GAME. I HAD TIME TO PROCESS THE LAST SIX WEEKS. >> Stephen: YOU PROSESD THE LAST SIX WEEKS?  WHAT DID YOU PROCESS OUT OF IT. ONCE YOU PROCESS IT FROM ORE TO ITS REGARD IIFIED STATE WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT IT WAS? >> Jon: I FOUND OUT THAT YOUR FACE IS STILL ON THE WALLS AND THE CEILING OF ED SULLIVAN. >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WE HAD THOSE PUT UP THERE PERMANENTLY, JON. >> Jon: YEAH. >> Stephen: WERE YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE TO HOST WHEN WE CAME BACK AFTER THE BREAK? >> Jon: IT JUST TOOK A MINUTE TO SETTLE IN. >> Stephen: OH, WHEN YOU CAME BACK, IT WASN'T A FEVER DREAM, HIS FACE SELF REE WHERE. >> Jon: RIGHT, DEEP MAN, DEEP. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> Jon: DEEP, MAN. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE I HAD A GOOD WEEK OFF TOO. I HAD A GOOD WEEK OFF TOO. I EXPECTED TO BE THE HOST WHEN I CAME BACK. OF COURSE MY WEEK OFF PAY HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT I DID NOT COME CLOSE, NO ONE CAME CLOSE TO HOW GREAT HILLARY CLINTON'S WEEK WAS. (APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: JIMMY, IT WAS A GREAT WEEK. THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) NOW ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS. ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MSES CLINTON'S WEEK IS THAT HER SECOND APPEARANCE IN FRONT OF THE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE WHICH IS CHAIRED BY SOUTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN AND ACRYLIC AMERICAN TREY GOWDY, LAST THURSDAY, SHERIFF GOWDY AND THE BENGHAZI BUNCH GRILLED HILLARY FROM 10 A.M. TO 9 AT NIGHT. THAT IS 11 HOURS. THEY ACHIEVED TANTRIC SUBCOMMITTEE. THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS EVER TESTIFIED LONGER IS STING. (LAUGHTER) BUT FOR ALL THAT GRILLING, HILLARY COULD NOT BE RATTLED. AT THE END OF THE MARATHON INQUISITION SHE LOOKED LIKE THIS WHILE CHAIRMAN GOWDY LOOKED LIKE THIS. (LAUGHTER) ONE OF THEM LOOKS LIKE THE HOST OF A COCKTAIL PARTY. THE OTHER LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAD HIS BARK STRIPPED OFF BY CARPENTER ANTS. AND ALL THE HEADLINES WERE ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS HANDED HILLARY A GIFT. AND THAT GIFT WAS IN THE FORM OF CASH BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON HAD THE BEST FUNDRAISING HOUR IN HER ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RIGHT AFTER THE HEARING. SO-- THEY CALLED IT-- (APPLAUSE) I KNOW THEY CALLED IT A HEARING BUT IT WAS REALLY MORE OF A TELETHON. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY SHE BROUGHT ALONG THAT GIANT THERMOMETER. (LAUGHTER) AND MORE GOOD NEWS FOR HILLARY CLINTON, JOE BIDEN IS ALSO NOT RUNNING. AND HE EXPLAINED WHY ON "60 MINUTES." >> YOU CAN'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT UNLESS YOU THROW YOUR ENTIRE BEING INTO IT. >> Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD POINT. RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IS A FULL-TIME JOB. AND JOE'S ALREADY GOT ONE OF THOSE. THAT'S WHY THE RACE IS LOADED WITH UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) GET A JOB, YOU BUMS! I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW, SECRETARY CLINTON. SO AS A VOTER I'M SAD TO LOSE JOE BIDEN BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND. BEING A CANDIDATE SUCKS. IT'S AN UGLY, NASTY BATTLE WITH A SINGLE BLOODY SURVIVOR. IT'S LIKE THE HUNGER GAMES. NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES! (APPLAUSE) YEAH, YES! YES! YES, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES. TRIBUTES, ASSEMBLE. YES. OH, LOOK AT THEM, LOOK AT THE CROP, SO HOPEFUL AND FRESH FACED. WELL, HOPEFUL. CHILDREN, LET THIS BE A CAUTIONARY TALE. MOISTURIZE. AT FIRST BLUSH THIS LOOKS LIKE A BOUNTIFUL CROP HEADED TO THE CAPITOL BUT LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY ALL THE REPUBLICANS. EVEN DONALD TRUMP COULDN'T COMB OVER A BALD SPOT THAT BIG. HA HA! BY THE WAY, DONALD, AS A FRIEND, THAT GOLDEN WIG IS A BIT OVER THE TOP. TONE IT DOWN. AND JUST LAST WEEK THE DEMOCRATS BALD PATCH GOT EVEN PATCHIER. >> FORMER VIRGINIA SENATOR JIM WEBB ANNOUNCING HE IS DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE. >> I AM WITHDRAWING FOR MANY-- FROM ANY CONSIDERATION OF BEING THE DEMG KRATTIC PARTY'S NOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENCY. >> Stephen: YES, JIM WEBB IS WITHDRAWING FROM CONSIDERATION. I'M SURE THAT WILL COME AS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO HIS SUPPORTER. (LAUGHTER) SO SAD, SO SAD. HA HA, YEAH! HA HA. OF COURSE AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, WEBB REALIZED THAT HE WAS A TOUGH SELL TO DISTRICT DEMOCRAT. >> I FULLY ACCEPT THAT MY VIEWS ON MANY ISSUES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE PO-- POWER STRUCTURE AND THE NOMINATING BASE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. >> Stephen: YES, THERE ARE MANY ISSUES WHERE THEY'RE NOT COMPATIBLE LIKE GUNS, THE BUDGET AND SHOULD JIM WEBB BE PRESIDENT? NO, I THINK NOT. AND NOW THE GOOD SENATOR CAN SPEND MORE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY COMPLAINING THAT THEY GOT MORE TIME TO SPEAK THAN HE DID. SO FAIRWELL TRIBUTE WEBB. I SAY WE HARDLY KNEW YEE. BUT HARDLY IS TOO GENEROUS A TERM. SINCE YOU WERE POLLING IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AT 0 PERCENT. GOOSE EGG. JUST PROVING THE OLD SAYING, IF A TREE FALLS IN THE WOODS AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT, IT WOULD STILL GET MORE VOTES THAN JIM WEBB. HA HA. YEAH! (APPLAUSE) SO TRIBUTE WEBB HAS GONE TO THE VALLEY OF THE ANCESTORS. UNLESS THIS DELIGHTFUL TALKING CINDERBLOCK SHOW MAKES A STUNNING COMEBACK. >> I'M NOT GOING AWAY. I'M THINKING ABOUT ALL MY OPTIONS. >> Stephen: YES, PLEASE, THINK THROUGH ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS. (LAUGHTER) ESPECIALLY THAT GOING AWAY ONE. IT FEELS RIGHT. IT'S TASTY. AND THE DEMOCRATIC DRAMA CONTINUED. FOR JIM WEBB WASN'T THE ONLY FORMER REPUBLICAN TO DROP OUT OF THE POWER GAMES. >> DEMOCRAT LINCOLN CHAFEE ENDED HIS CAMPAIGN TODAY. >> NOW AS YOU MAY KNOW I HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING ON A PLATFORM OF PROSPERITY THROUGH PEACE. >> Stephen: ACTUALLY, WE DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WERE CAMPAIGNING AT ALL. (LAUGHTER). >> Stephen: OH, OH. BUT DO CONTINUE, BRAVE TRIBUTE. >> BUT AFTER MUCH THOUGHT I HAVE DECIDED TO END MY CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENT TODAY. >> Stephen: SUCH A SHAME. THIS LINCOLN HAD ALL THE CHAR IS MA OF THE LOGS HE WAS NAMED FOR. LET'S LOOK BACK UPON TRIBUTE CHAIFERREE'S JOURNEY THROUGH THE ARENA. ACCORDING TO THE GAME MAKE ESCHS AT 538.COM GOVERNOR CHAFEE POLL NUMBERS FROM A ROLLER-COASTER RIDE ROCKETING ANYWHERE FROM 0% UP TO THE DIZZEING HEIGHTS OF JUST OVER .6%. .6%. YES. MEANING AT PEAK CHAFEE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE, HE HAD THE SUPPORT OF ONE GUY FROM THE WAIST UP. OH, HA, HA, HA. A. OH. NO. NO. HE HAD SUCH PROMISE WHEN HE OFFERED HIMSELF AS A TRIBUTE BACK IN JUNE. HIS FIRST WORDS OF HIS ACTUAL PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE. I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD FARRIER. >> A FARRIER PUTS SHOES ON HORSES. >> Stephen: YES. SO TRUE. YEAH. SO TRUE, A FARRIER PUTS SHOES ON HORSES. AND THAT IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF A BOLD JOBS PLAN FOR THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. I WAS SURE HE WAS GOING TO GET THE VOTE OF EVERY SCRIVENER, COOPER, MILL NR AND WAINWRIGHT AND YET EVEN WITH ALL OF CHAFEE'S KNOWLEDGE OF EQUINE COBBLING, IRONICALLY HE WAS ILL-EQUIPPED FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL HORSE RACE. HA HA. WHICH IS TRAGIC. BECAUSE HE WAS THE CANDIDATE WILLING TO BOLDLY EMBRACE INTERNATIONALISM. >> HERE'S A BOLD EMBRACE OF INTERNATIONALISM. LET'S JOIN THE REST OF THE WORLD AND GO METRIC. >> Stephen: YES! HA SLAMG A STIRRING CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, GO METRIC. UNFORTUNATELY, AMERICAN VOTERS DIDN'T GIVE 2.5 MILLI [BLEEP] HA, HA, HA. BEEP, BEEP, BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. MILLI-BEEP. OF COURSE EVEN WITH THIS WEEK'S BLOODBATH AT THE CORNUCOPIA YA, OUR GAMES CONTINUE. BUT BEFORE THEY DO, WE RAISE OUR CANONS TO HONOR THOSE. >> HOLD ON A SECOND, STEPHEN. >> Stephen: STANLEY TUCCI! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) STANLEY. >> STEFER EN. >> Stephen: STANLEY. >> PLEASE, STEPHEN, THANK YOU. >> Stephen: STANLEY TUCCI. OH! STANLEY. STANLEY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE ON MY SHOW TONIGHT. >> I'M NOT. I'M NOT. I WAS JUST WALKING DOWN BROADWAY-- . >> Stephen: OLD BROADWAY. >> THE GREAT WHITE WAY AND I-- MY TUCCI-SENSE STARTED TINGLING AS IT-- . >> Stephen: YES. HA! >> AS IT DOES WHENEVER SOMEBODY IN PERSONNABILITY-- IMPERSONATES THE CHARACTER I PLAY, CAESER FLICKERMAN. >> Stephen: STANLEY, PLEASE, FOR LEGAL REASONS I DON'T KNOW WHO CEASE AR FLICKERMAN. IS OBVIOUSLY THE CHARACTER I'M DOING IS HIS BROTHER JULIUS FLICKERMAN. >> OH. LOOK, STEPHEN, YEAH, I-- . >> Stephen: STANLEY, ST STANLEY, YOU SMELL SCRUMPTIOUS. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT ARE YOU HAVING FUN HERE BUT CAESER FOR ME IS A NUANCED ROLE, HE IS A LARGER-THAN-LIFE TV HOST WHO'S HUNGRY FOR THE ADULATION OF THE CROWD AND WHOSE EFFERVESCENCE MASKS HIS TRUE VULNERABILITY. (LAUGHTER). >> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. >> CAESER FLICKERMAN IS THE ROLE THAT I'M PROUDEST OF, SECOND ONLY TO MY PERFORMANCE OF MITCHELL GARABEDIAN IN THE FILM SPOTLIGHT. >> Stephen: STANLEY, WAIT A SECOND. AM I HEARING YOU CORRECTLY S THAT THE SAME SPOTLIGHT THAT IS OPENING IN SELECT THEATERS ON NOVEMBER 6th. I HEAR IT'S GREAT. YOU SHOULD REALLY STOP BY SOMETIME TO PROMOTE THAT. (LAUGHTER) >> I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. >> Stephen: WELL, I'M SORRY, STANLEY. I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS GETTING JULIUS FLICKERMAN SO VERY WRONG. >> NO, STEPHEN, IT'S NOT WRONG, IT IS NOT WRONG T ISN'T-- NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT WRONG AT ALL. IT'S JUST THAT THOSE THEATRICAL MANNERISMS AND THAT BUBBLY ATTITUDE, YOU'RE CLEARLY, YOU ARE MORE OF AN EFFIE TRINKET. >> Stephen: REALLY? >> OR PERHAPS HER BROTHER JULIUS TRINKET. STANLEY, STANLEY. (APPLAUSE) STANLEY, WILL YOU JOIN ME IN CELEBRATING THE FALLEN? >> I WOULD LOVE TO. THANK YOU. >> Stephen: THEY HAVE FOUGHT BRAVELY AGAINST OBSCURITY BUT ULTIMATELY-- WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN? >> OH, WEBB AND CHAFEE. >> Stephen: RIGHT.

WHY ONLY ONE DAY. >> IT WAS A TONEY RESTAURANT AND SOME MAN WAS QUITE INAPPROPRIATE. >> Stephen: HOW SO? >> HE SLAPPED MY BUM AND I POURED PASTA IN HIS LAP. YEAH. AND GOT FIRED. >> Stephen: THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS. I THINK THAT IS WHY EVERYBODY SHOULD PROBABLY WORK A SERVICE JOB AT SOME POINT. >> ONE DAY. >> Stephen: SO IF THEY FIND OUT WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A SERVANT. >> YES. >> Stephen: YOU GET FIRED IF YOU DO THINGS LIKE THAT. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: AND THEN AFTER THAT WHAT DID YOU DO. >> THEN I WORKED IN A CLOTHES SHOP.

DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE CASE? >> NO, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE YOUR PHONE HACKED IF YOU ARE AN ACTRESS. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT BUT I LIVED IN LONDON. I DO LIVE IN LONDON WHERE AT A CERTAIN POINT THAT KIND OF ATTENTION WAS JUST REALLY AGGRESSIVE. LIKE NOWHERE ELSE. AND IT BECAME-- AND I THINK THE MORE YOU RESIST IT, WHICH I DID, THE WORSE IT GOT. AND IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE. SO I SUED EVERYONE. (LAUGHTER). >> Stephen: YOU ALSO-- (APPLAUSE). >> Stephen: YOU ALSO TURNED DOWN A JOB IN A PLAY BECAUSE YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE BEING OFFERED LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT YOUR MALE COSTAR WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID. >> YES. >> Stephen: IN THAT. >> YES. >> Stephen: THERE IS A LOT OF TALK NOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE BEING PAID LESS IN HOLLYWOOD AND IN SHOW BUSINESS. >> AND IN THE WORLD, I THINK. >> Stephen: ONE OF THE REASONS WE FOUND OUT THAT WOMEN WERE BEING PAID SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN MEN IN HOLLYWOOD IS THROUGH THE SONY HACK. >> YES. >> Stephen: WE FOUND OUT THAT, YOU KNOW, JENNIFER LAWRENCE WAS BEING PAID MUCH LESS THAN HER COSTARS. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: ARE YOU TORN THAT WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT THROUGH A HACK? >> THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING-- . >> Stephen: OR IS THAT ONE OKAY WITH YOU. >> OH MY GOD.
