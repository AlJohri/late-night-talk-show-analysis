WELCOME, SIR. WELCOME, YOUNG MAN. UP THERE. OUT THERE. MR. AND MRS. AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. HI, JON. ♪ HEY, HEY, HEY YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ♪ >> Stephen:  WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW," EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. YOU FOLKS MAKE IT SO FUN COMING OUT HERE EVERY NIGHT. I DO LOVING DOING THIS SHOW. ONE THING ABOUT BEING ON CAMERA IS YOU HAVE TO CARE ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK. HOW DO YOU THINK I LOOK TONIGHT? DO YOU THINK I LOOK OKAY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT WAS VERY NIEFS YOU TO SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) I'D LIKE TO THANK MY HAIR AND MAKEUP FOLKS AND, OF COURSE, THE ENTIRE TEAM OF SPANX WRANGLERS THAT LOWER ME INTO MY SUIT EVERY NIGHT. AND HERE'S THE THING: I HAVE THE SAME WORRIES AS ANY GUY MY AGE. IS MY HAIR THINNING? IS MY WAIST THICKENING? WOULD IT ELIMINATE THESE CROW'S FEET IF I BOUGHT A CORVETTE? JUST NORMAL INSECURITY. WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE A NEW AD CAMPAIGN FROM AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS. THEY HAVE A LINGERIE BRAND FOR WOMEN OF ALL BODY TYPES CALLED AERIE. AND LAST MONTH, THEY ANNOUNCED A NEW UNDERWEAR LINE CALLED AERIE MEN TO HELP GUYS OF ALL SHAPES FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT THEIR BODIES. >> BEING AN AERIE MAN ISN'T JUST ABOUT BEING IN YOUR UNDERWEAR. IT'S ABOUT BEING YOU. >> HEALTHY BODY IMAGE TO ME IS LOVING WHO YOU ARE. >> THE REAL YOU IS SEXY. >> THE REAL YOU IS SEXY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: DAMN RIGHT! IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME! THE REAL ME IS SEXY! THIS AD MADE ME SO POSITIVE ABOUT MY BODY, I CANCELLED MY GYM MEMBERSHIP...FOUR YEARS AGO. I KNEW IT WAS COMING. SO IT WAS COMFORTING TO KNOW AMERICAN EAGLE WAS BEHIND ME AND LIKED WHAT THEY SAW BACK THERE ( LAUGHTER ) I FELT GOOD. I FELT VALUABLE. I FELT DESIRABLE. UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT THE AERIE MAN CAMPAIGN WAS AN APRIL FOOLS' JOKE. >> Audience: OH! >> Stephen: YEAH, AMERICAN EAGLE EXPLAINED THAT THE WEIGHED WAS ALL IN GOOD FUN TO PARODY BODY-POSITIVE MARKETING. THAT'S RIGHT. "LOVE YOUR BODY THE WAY IT IS! HA-HA, JUST KIDDING! YOU'RE HIDEOUS." BUT REALLY WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THAT NOT ONLY WAS THIS A CRUEL JOKE. THEY DID NOT EVEN POST THE VIDEO ON APRIL 1. THEY POSTED IT ON  MARCH 23. YOU CAN'T DO APRIL FOOLS WHENEVER YOU WANT TO. YOU HAVE TO DO A THING ASSOCIATED WITH A DAY ON THAT DAY. FOR INSTANCE, I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND YOU DO NOT HAND OUT CANDY TO CHILDREN ON ANY DAY BUT HALLOWEEN. I SAY THAT THIS AD DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APRIL FOOLING. SO ON BEHALF OF ALL MEN, I DEMAND THAT AMERICAN EAGLE SEND ME AN OFFICIAL, NOTARIZED LETTER THAT SAYS YOU FIND THIS SEXY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IN FACT, IN FACT, RIGHT NOW, ON THI'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WHAT A REAL MAN'S BODY LOOKS LIKE, ALL RIGHT? AND THIS IS AS MUCH OF MY BODY AS I AM COMFORTABLE SHOWING IN PUBLIC, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOUR MUFFIN SHAMING. ONE THING I DO FEEL GOOD ABOUT: WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FIRST, FROM THE NEW MOVIE "MR. RIGHT," I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH SAM ROCKWELL AND ANNA KENDRICK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN I'LL TALK WITH TELEVISION STAR AND AUTHOR DAVID DUCHOVNY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) PLUS, WE'LL HAVE MUSIC FROM AUTOLUX. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ OH, RIGHT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI TO THE BAND, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO PUT SOME FUNK IN YOUR TRUNK, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: SCIENTISTS DEVELOPED A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT CAN ACCURATELY CREATE NEW REMBRANDT PAINTINGS, THOUGH ITS DESIGNERS ARE STILL HOPING IT GOES TO LAW SCHOOL. >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ANNA KENDRICK AND SAM ROCKWELL. DAVID DUCHOVNY. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY AUTOLUX. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WOOO! THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU, JON. HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING TONIGHT? YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE HAD A REALLY FUN SHOW LAST NIGHT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MISSED IT, MELISSA MCCARTHY AND HUSBAND BEN FALCONE COMPETED IN OUR NEW SHOW-IN-SHOW COOKING SHOW "SMOOSHED," WHERE THEY HAD TO MAKE A DISH IN UNDER A MINUTE USING MYSTERY INGREDIENTS: MARSHMALLOWS BACON BITS, SAL TEENS AND REALLY ANYTHING ELSE. IT WAS PRETTY FUN, UNTIL I WAS THE ONE WHO REALIZED I HAD TO EAT WHAT THEY MADE WHICH DID NOT OCCUR TO ME UNTIL THE ODD YENTS WAS ALREADY CHANTING, "EAT IT, EAT IT." OF COURSE, AS ALWAYS ON "SMOOSHED," WE'RE GOING TO BE POSTING THE RECIPES FOR BEN'S CRISPY LATE SHOW CANAPES AND MELISSA'S RUSTIC TUSCAN HASH ON OUR TWITTER FEED @COLBERTLATESHOW, AND THE SHOULD BE POSTED AROUND THE TIME I FINISH DIGESTING SOME OF IT. ALSO LAST NIGHT, WE DID SOMETHING CALLED "MIDNIGHT CONFESSIONS," WHERE I CONFESS MY SINS TO THE AUDIENCE. WHO ALWAYS FORGIVE ME. TO THANK YOU I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SHARE YOUR CONFESSIONS WITH ME SO JUST TWEET US YOUR CONFESSIONS USING THE HASHTAG #LATESHOWCONFESSIONS. THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY SINS, JUST THINGS YOU'RE ASHAMED OF. WHO KNOWS? MAYBE YOUR DARK SECRET COULD END UP ON NATIONAL TV. SPEAKING OF DEEP SHAME, THE 2016 ELECTION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LAST NIGHT, THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN REJECTED THE FRONTRUNNERS. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THE THE WINNER WAS-- AND JUST HOLD ON, LET ME BRACE MIEDZ FOR YOUR REACTION. BERNIE SANDERS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'LL KEEP THOSE HANDY IN CASE THERE'S A STORY ABOUT ONE DIRECTION REUNITING TO GIVE OUT FREE POT. AND LAST NIGHT, BERNIE FIRED UP THE CROWD WITH HIS VICTORY SPEECH. >> I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE READY FOR A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. YES, WE CAN. YES, WE CAN. >> Stephen: YES WE CAN... STEAL SLOGANS FROM BARACK OBAMA. ( LAUGHTER ) UNLESS THAT ACTUALLY IS BARACK OBAMA AND HE'S AGED EVEN MORE THAN I THOUGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT THE BIG NEWS-- THE BIG NEWS LAST NIGHT WAS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. TED CRUZ WON. IT WAS A HUGE UPSET, BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU VOTED FOR TED CRUZ, YOU'RE STILL PRETTY UPSET ABOUT IT. OF COURSE, THE EVEN BIGGER NEWS DONALD TRUMP LOST. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ANALYSTS SAY HE LOST BECAUSE OF... THINGS HE'S SAID AND DONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ALSO-- AND THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT-- THINGS HE HASN'T SAID. MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE COMPLAIN THAT TRUMP TENDS TO TALK BIG BUT NEVER COMES UP WITH SPECIFIC PROPOSALS. WELL, ON MONDAY, TRUMP PUT THAT CRITICISM TO BED BY FINALLY GIVING REPUBLICAN VOTERS CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HE WOULD ELIMINATE. >> WOULD YOU ELIMINATE ANY DEPARTMENTS? >> OH, ABSOLUTELY. DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL. I MEAN, THE DEP IS KILLING US ENVIRONMENTALLY. IT'S JUST KILLING OUR BUSINESSES. >> Stephen: YES, ABSOLUTELY. TRUMP PROMISED TO KILL THE WASTEFUL DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL, THE D.E.P. EVEN THE ABBREVIATION IS WASTEFUL. BECAUSE THAT "P" DOESN'T STAND FOR ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, WE LOOKED IT UP, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DOES NOT EXIST, MEANING TRUMP IS EITHER TALKING OUT OF HIS ASS, OR HE'S ALREADY ELIMINATED IT. THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE TRUMP ELIMINATES ALL THE OTHER WASTEFUL DEPARTMENTS WE DON'T NEED BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXIST, BIG GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS LIKE THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF MONEYING. THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE FARMS. THE BUREAU OF BIRDS AND FOXES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL ERECTION AGENCY. ( LAUGHTER ) THE U.S. STEAK DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INFERIOR. THE U.S. GHOST GUARD. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTINS. THE UNITED STATES MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN CENTIPEDES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH SAM ROCKWELL AND ANNA KENDRICK. >> Stephen: HEY! WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUESTS STAR IN THE NEW ROMANTIC ACTION-COMEDY, "MR. RIGHT." >> IS THIS MY DAD? >> JUST UNCONSCIOUS. I'M REALLY SORRY. >> OKAY. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY-- YOU HAVE A BATH TUB, RIGHT? >> HEY, I'M NOT SURE, UM, THAT YOU SHOULD BE HERE. BECAUSE I DON'T UPON, I FEEL REALLY CONFUSED. AND, LIKE, WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A BREAK. >> WHAT-- A BREAK? OKAY. >> OKAY. >> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME ANNA KENDRICK AND SAM ROCKWELL. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> HEY, HEY. >> Stephen: HEY, NICE TO SEE YOU. >> I I'M BACK ALREADY.

SHE WAS AN EXCELLENT GUEST. >> YOU GUYS SANG. >> Stephen: YES, WE DID. DO YOU SING? >> I DO NOT SING. MAYBE A CROONER, BUT NOT REALLY. >> I DON'T KNOW, SAM IS VERY MODEST. HE SAYS HE DOESN'T DO LOTS OF THINGS AND THEN IT TURNS OUT HE ASK DOES. >> IN THE SHOWER, MAYBE. >> Stephen: "MR. RIGHT," AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE, IS A BIT OF AN UNUSUAL COMBINATION. AS I SAID BEFORE, AN ACTION-COMEDY. IT'S LIKE A ROM-COM, WITH A HIGH BODY COUNT. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: WHAT ATTRACTED EACH ONE OF YOU THE MOST, THE MEAT CUTE OR THE BANG-BANG? >> BOTH. >> I LIKED BOTH. I WANTED TO WORK WITH SAM. I'VE WANTED TO WORK WITH SAM FOR A LONG TIME. AND, YEAH, I LIKED THAT IT WAS SOME FLIRTY-FLIRTY, BUT THEN THERE'S SOME CASUAL KILLING. I THINK THAT'S GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH. DO YOU SING IN THE MOVIE? >> I DON'T SING IN THE MOVIE. >> Stephen: DO YOU DANCE IN THE MOVIE? I KNOW YOU DANCE. >> I DO DANCE. I DO SEVERAL HOOFING MOMENTS. SPLIT. SOME FIGHTING DANCING. >> Stephen: YOU DANCE IN EVERY MOVIE, RIGHT? >> I DO. I'M A DANCING WHORE. YEAH. IN EVERY MOVIE ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: IS IT A DEAL, "I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DANCE IN THE MOVIE BEFORE I DO THE MOVIE?" >> YES, YES, IT IS. >> Stephen: IS IT CONTRACTUAL OR A HANDSHAKE THING? >> IT'S KIND OF A VERBAL AGREEMENT, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DANCE HANDSHAKE. >> BUT DOESN'T YOUR BETTER HALF TRY TO GET YOU TO NOT DANCE IN A MOVIE. SHE THINKS YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH A MOVIE WITHOUT DANCING. >> THAT'S RIGHT, MY GIRLFRIEND MAKES FUN OF ME. >> WE DID AN IMPROV MOVYING IT AND THE DIRECTOR SAID, "JUST HAVE FUN. JUST DANCE." SAM SAID, "I CAN'T DANCE. SHE WINS." >> DANCING IN EVERYTHING AND IT WAS TOO MUCH. SHE WAS MAKING FUN OF ME. >> Stephen: WHAT DOES IT DO FOR YOU? WHY DO YOU DANCE? >> HE JUST LOOKS SO GREAT. >> I LIKE TO EXPRESS MYSELF PHYSICALLY. I THINK IT'S AN HOMAGE TO CHRIS WALKEN. I DON'T KNOW. >> Stephen: IF I EVER SEE YOU IN A MOVIE AND YOU DON'T DANCE, I'LL SAY HE'S BEING HELD HOSTAGE. IS IT A SIGNAL? >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. >> Stephen: THIS MOVIE, I WISH WE SHOWED A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT, YOU MAKE OUT SIGNIFICANTLY. AND VIGOROUSLY. >> YUP. >> Stephen: IN THAT KEEP. >> YEAH, WE DO. >> Stephen: IS THAT-- NO ONE'S EVER ASKED ME TO DO THAT ON CAMERA BEFORE. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN! >> Stephen: I'VE NEVER BEEN PAID TO, LIKE, DO A LOVE SCENE OR A MAKEOUT SCENE ON CAMERA. >> I HEARD JEFF DANIELS AND HELEN MIRREN KISSED. >> Stephen: HELIN MIRREN DID KISS ME QUITE TENDERLY ON THE SHOW, AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME ANYBODY  KISSED ME PASSIONATELY SINCE I GOT MARRIED 25 YEARS AGO ANAND IT WAS GREAT, BUT THAT'S IT. AS A WORKING ACTOR OR ACTRESS, WHEN YOU SEE, "OH, YEAH, I'M GOING TO MAKE OUT WITH THIS PERSON," IS THAT GOOD OR IS IT LIKE, "OH, NO, NOT THAT AGAIN?" >> WHEN YOU'RE JUST READING THE SCRIPT, YOU DON'T KNOW THE PERSON SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE OTHER PERSON WILL BE? >> YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LIKE, YOU KNOW. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, THOUGH? >> A GOOD ACTOR, BUT I THINK WE'VE BOTH BEN BN IN SITUATION WHERE'S WE THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT. AND AFTER A MONTH OF WORKING WITH THEM YOU'RE LIKE, "I HAVE TO KISS THIS ( BLEEP ). HERE WE GO." >> THAT CAN HAPPEN. >> Stephen: SOMETIMES YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, YEAH, ANNA KENDRICK, THAT'S GOOD." OR YOU'RE LIKE, "I'LL BE A PROFESSIONAL ABOUT THIS." WHAT ABOUT THE FIGHTING? >> FIGHTING IS FUN. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE STUPT DOUBLE S. >> Stephen:  OH, REALLY. >> A VERY GOOD STUNT TEAM WE HAD A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T DO YOUR OWN STUNTS? >> A LITTLE BIT.

TRUE, AND YET-- >> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, RIGHT? >> IT WAS AN DESCENT. >> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE I STRUCK A NERVE. >> IT WAS THIS PART WHERE I'M NOT LOOKING, I'M LOOKING OVER HERE AND I THROW A PUNCH OVER HERE. AND THE ACTOR-- BECAUSE IT WASN'T A STUNT GUY. IT WAS ONE OF THE ACTORS, AND HE KNOT, LIKE AIR, LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR ME AND I ENDED UP SMACKING HIM.

IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE TOO COMMON. >> Stephen: WHAT WAS BAD ABOUT IT? SENSATIONAL? >> YES, AND IT WASN'T ABOUT KINGS AND QUEENS. IT WAS ABOUT REGULAR PEOPLE. THE NOVEL WAS THE FIRST REAL DEMOCRATIC, YOU KNOW, WORK OF ART. AND IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE-- IT WAS GOING TO AFFECT THE MORALS OF PEOPLE. AND SO IT WAS MUCH LIKE TV IS NOW. AND IT'S FUNNY, WHEN I MENTIONED THIS-- WHEN MY KIDS-- THEY'RE ON THE COMPUTER ALL DAY-- AND MY-- MY PARENTS USED TO ALWAYS TELL ME TO READ, RIGHT. "GO READ A BOOK." I'D SAY, "I'M BORED."

DID I GET IT RIGHT. >> I THINK YOU GOT IT RIGHT. >> Stephen: WE NEVER USED IT. HOW MUCH? $560. GOT IT. WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT? >> WE HAVE LIFE-SIZED ACTION FIGURES. >> Stephen: THESE ARE ACTUALLY LIKE EIGHT FEET TALL ACTION FIGURE BOXES. ONE SAYS J.J. ABRAMS. ONE SAYS HARRISON FORD. BECAUSE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE J.J. ABRAMS AND HARRISON FORD LIE INSIDE OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE ACTION FIGURES? >> RIGHT. ON THE GREEN SCREEN AND A LITTLE GIRL COMES OUT. >> Stephen: A LITTLE GIRL COMES OUT AND OPENS THEMMUM LIEB IT'S CHRISTMAS MORNING AND SHE'S GOING TO SAY, "IT'S A HAN SOLO ACTION FIGURE." AND HARRISON FORD WAS GOING TO GO, "ACTUALLY, IT'S A HARRISON FORD ACTION FIGURE. I'VE DONE MORE THAN HAN SOLO."

( BLEEP ). >> THAT WAS. >> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD. >> THIS IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT OF A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOMETIMES WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> WE WANT TO DO REALLY FUNNY STUFF. >> Stephen: THE BEST WE CAN DO. >> EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO THINK OF WHAT'S HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FACTOR IN FOR YOU QUITE AS MUCH ALWAYS. >> Stephen: NO, IT DOESN'T. I GENERALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. >> NOT QUITE-- NOT NECESSARILY QUITE AS MUCH AS THE REST OF THE PEOPLE. >> Stephen: RIGHT, RIGHT. >> SO THE DAY BEFORE WE WERE GOING TO SHOOT WITH HARRISON FORD AND J.J. ABRAMS YOU ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH A MORE COMPLICATED CONCEPT THAT HAD SIX DIFFERENT CAMERA SETUPS AND FOUR WARDROBE CHANGES, ONE OF WHICH INCLUDED -- BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING TO CARRY HARRISON FORD AROUND ON YOUR BACK LIKE UPPER A TON-TON. >> Stephen: I WAS A TON-TON. SO WE MADE A BLUE SCREEN SUIT WITH THE PING-PONG BALLS ON IT. >> AND TON-TON YOU IN LATER. >> Stephen: AND WE WERE GOING TO PUT THE TON-TON IN LATER. >> WE MADE TWO OF THOSE. THERE WAS ONE FOR HARRISON. >> Stephen: WE WERE GOING TO HAVE HARRISON FORD WEAR ONE OF THESE? >> SOMETHING ABOUT RECREATING THE CREDO BAR SCENE. >> Stephen: SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW. I'M SO SURPRISED HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. SO THIS IS THE TOTAL, THIS IS THE TOTAL. OH, WOW. AND YOU HAD TWO OF THOSE. THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE AND WE HAD TO DO TWO OF THOSE. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: OKAY, SO WHAT? ( LAUGHTER ). >> WELL, SO, I MEAN, I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAD A SOLUTION AND COULD USE ALL THESE -- >> I UNDERSTAND. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS TO JUSTIFY IT NOT ME. >> YES, OF COURSE. I HAVE TO GO BACK AND EXPLAIN WHERE ALL THIS MONEY IS GOING. >> Stephen: TO THE MONEY PEOPLE WHY YOU SPENT THAT MUCH MONEY WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. >> NOT A LOT. >> Stephen: OKAY, I WANT TO HELP YOU OUT. SOMETHING HAS BEEN PREPARED BACKSTAGE TO GET YOU OUT OF A DITCH HERE. SO RIGHT NOW, EVIDENTLY, WE'RE GOING TO SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE ALL OF THEM INTO OUR FIRST INSTALLMENT OF "THE LATE SHOW UNUSED PROP THEATRE." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> EPISODE ONE, AN HISTORICAL REENACTMENT OF THE PILGRIMS LANDING ON PLYMOUTH ROCK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> BEHOLD, FELLOW PILGRIMS, PLYMOUTH ROCK. THERE WE WILL FIND RELIGOUS FREEDOM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >> WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD, FRIEND. >> GOOD DAY, POCAHANTUS. I AM CORN. OR AS YOU CALL ME, MAIZE.
