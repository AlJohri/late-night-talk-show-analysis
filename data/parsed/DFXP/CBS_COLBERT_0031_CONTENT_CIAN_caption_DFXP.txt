IT'S ON A SATURDAY THIS YEAR. THAT MEANS CRAZY PARTIES AND WALKS OF SHAME DRESSED AS A SEXY CRAYON. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'RE READY AT MY HOUSE ALREADY. WE DID OUR HALLOWEEN DECORATING THIS WEEKEND, SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. I GOT THE LANTERNS THAT LOOK LIKE PUMPKINS. HAD A FOG MACHINE, BUT FOR SOME REASON IT'S BROKEN THIS YEAR SO I'M JUST GOING TO HOOK UP A HOSE TO MY CAR EXHAUST. ( LAUGHTER ) THE KIDS LOVE IT, MAKES THEM ALL GIDDY. AND I GOT A SKELETON HANGING ON THE TREE. IT'S ALWAYS THERE. FEELS APPROPRIATE ONE DAY A YEAR. NOT SURE HOW IT GOT THERE. I'M SURPRISED THE TREE PRUNER DOESN'T TAKE IT DOWN. HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THAT GUY IN, LIKE, A YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN-- I TOLD THESE GUYS THIS-- EVERY YEAR I'M GOING TO BE A VAMPIRE. I'M A VAMPIRE AGAIN THIS YEAR. IT'S THE SEXIEST COSTUME THERE IS. JON, DO YOU HAVE A COSTUME DO YOU DRESS UP? >> Jon: YEAH, SOMETIMES. A POWER RANGER. >> Stephen: YOU'VE GOT THE PHYSIQUE. WHICH POWER RANGER? >> Stephen: THE RED ONE. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: WHY THE RED? WHAT'S THE RED POWER? WHAT POWER DOES THE RED HAVE? >> Stephen: NO SPECIFIC POWER, JUST DIFFERENT COLORS. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: REALLY, I'M NOT REALLY WITH THE POWER RANGERS. THEY ALL ARE THE SAME, JUST DIFFERENT COLORS? >> Jon: YEAH, DIFFERENT COLORS, DIFFERENT ANIMAL S. >> Stephen:  REALLY, EACH COLOR IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL? >> Jon: YEAH, IT'S A VIBE, YOU KNOW?

IN FACT, POLICE IN ATLANTA ARE TRYING TO FIND A WOMAN WHO HIT A CAR AND DROVE AWAY WHILE WEARING A BEETLEJUICE COSTUME. I THINK IF  THEY REALLY WANT TO FIND HER, THEY SHOULD JUST SAY HER NAME THREE TIMES. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. I'LL BE TALKING WITH FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, HILLARY CLINTON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Jon: YEAH! >> Stephen: HILLARY CLINTON, RIGHT OVER THERE. AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE ACTUALLY, THAT SHE'LL BE MY GUEST, BUT AT THIS POINT, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S INEVITABLE. SHE HAS NOT NAMED HER RUNNING MATE YET, MAYBE BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO WAIT AND ASK HIM ON HIS LATE-NIGH TALK SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WAS TALKING ABOUT JON, BUT ALL RIGHT. THEN I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH AUTHOR AND TV MAN ANTHONY BOURDAIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S FUN. HE'S FUN. HE'S GROUCHY, BUT FUN. ON HIS SHOW, "PARTS UNKNOWN," HE TRAVELS TO FARAWAY PLACES TO EAT EXOTIC DELICACIES, AND I WATCH HIS SHOW ON MY COUCH, EATING FUDGE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'RE ALSO GOING TO ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MUSICIAN AND ACTRESS CARRIE BROWNSTEIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S RIGHT. I'LL JOIN IN.

ANTHONY BOURDAIN. AND CARRIE BROWNSTEIN. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: WOOO! >> Jon: BOOM! BOOM! >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S ONE THING THAT BEETLEJUICE AND I HAVE IN COMMON-- YOU CHANT MY NAME AND I SHOW UP. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO IT. FOLKS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF THAT MUCH, BUT LONGTIME VIEWERS OF LAST NIGHT'S SHOW KNOW THAT YESTERDAY I TALKED ABOUT HOT DOGS, A SUBJECT NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART, BECAUSE THEY ARE LODGED IN MY ARTERIES. AS I MENTIONED, A SHOCKING INVESTIGATION HAS FOUND THAT AFTER TESTING 75 BRANDS OF HOT DOGS, 2% OF THEM CONTAINED HUMAN D.N.A. THAT'S RIGHT, SOME OF THOSE HOT DOGS ARE ACTUALLY HOT "DOUGS." ( LAUGHTER ) NOW... ( LAUGHTER ) STILL SOUND PRETTY GOOD, THOUGH. STILL SOUND PRETTY GOOD. NOW, THE REPORT DOESN'T SPECIFY THE SOURCE OF THE HUMAN D.N.A. IS IT HAIR? IS IT FINGERNAILS? DID A LONELY FACTORY WORKER STAY LATE ONE NIGHT AND SEDUCE A SAUSAGE CASING MACHINE? COULD YOUR PIG IN A BLANKET HAVE A BUN IN THE OVEN? WHO KNOWS? FOLKS... YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THAT IMAGE, BY THE WAY. FOLKS, THIS NEWS COMPLETELY CHANGES AMERICA'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE ALL-BEEF FRANK. OR SHOULD I SAY THE ALL-FRANK BEEF? ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE SAD MEAT NEWS JUST KEEPS ON COMING BECAUSE TODAY I HEARD SOMETHING THAT WAS A GRADE-A BUMMER. >> BAD NEWS FOR BACON LOVERS AND LOVERS OF A LOT OF THINGS. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION RULED THAT BACON, SAUSAGE, AND OTHER PROCESSED MEATS CAN CAUSE CANCER. >> IT PUT PROCESSED MEAT IN THE SAME DANGER CATEGORY AS CIGARETTES AND ASBESTOS. >> Stephen: WHAT? SMOKED MEATS ARE AS DANGEROUS AS ASBESTOS? THERE GOES MY PLAN TO INSULATE MY ATTIC WITH JERKY! HOW CAN CURED MEAT BE BAD FOR YOU? IT'S GOT THE WORD "CURE" RIGHT IN THE NAME! NEXT, YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME THAT LIFESAVERS DON'T HELP DROWNING PEOPLE! ( LAUGHTER ) MAKES NO SENSE. THIS IS SAD, SO SAD. I LIVE FOR MEAT. I HAVE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- A TWO-POUND SLAB OF BACON IN MY FRIDGE AT ALL TIMES. I'VE GOT TO. I'M THE FATHER OF TWO TEENAGE BOYS. THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THEM OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING IS TO FRY UP SOME BACON. THAT'S WHAT THE KIDS CALL "WAKIN' AND BACON." THAT SMELLS, YOU GET THAT STUFF SIZZLING IN THE PAN IT MAKES THEM FLOAT DOWN TO THE KITCHEN LIKE A CARTOON HOBO FOLLOWING THE SMELL WAVES FROM A PIE. YOU THINK THEY'LL COME RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS TO THE SCENT OF ME WASHING KALE? "KIDS, IT'S TIME FOR BREAKFAST. COME WATCH DADDY CRY INTO HIS CANTALOUPE." BUT NOW, ACCORDING TO DOCTORS, I CAN'T SMOKE AND I CAN'T EAT BACON, BUT THEY HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT "SMOKING BACON." HERE WE GO. MMMM-MMMM-MMMM-MMMM-MMM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN I IMAGINED. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT BE CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL, THOUGH. THE PORK THESE DAYS IS SO MUCH STRONGER THAN IT WAS IN THE '60s. BUT THE THING THAT REALLY GETS MY GOAT-- IF I CAN EVEN HAVE GOAT ANYMORE-- IS THE WAY VEGETARIANS REACTED TO THIS NEWS. BECAUSE USING THE HASHTAG "SMUG VEGETARIAN"-- WHICH IS REDUNDANT, BY THE WAY-- THEY GOT ALL VEGGIER-THAN-THOU ON TWITTER, SAYING THINGS LIKE, "HA, I'M ALWAYS RIGHT. NOW I HAVE PROOF. SEE YA, BACON EATERS!" AND "MUA-HA-HA, RED MEAT CAUSES CANCER, LIKE WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT ALREADY. SORRY, MEAT EATERS. OH, HA-HA! HERE'S A VEGETARIAN JOKE. "WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD? I HOPE YOU GET CANCER." ( LAUGHTER ) I GET IT, VEGETARIANS. WHEN YOU SEE YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS SUFFERING, IT'S FUNNY. BUT HEAVEN FORBID I SHOULD EAT A SHRIMP! YOU ARE AWARE THAT AN EAR OF CORN HAS A BETTER CHANCE AT FORMING A COHERENT THOUGHT THAN A SHRIMP, RIGHT? HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A SHRIMP? IT'S ALMOST AS BORING AS TALKING TO A VEGETARIAN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND, I HOPE-- I HOPE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE ON THAT HIGH HORSE THAT YOU REFUSE TO EAT, VEGGIES, BECAUSE YOU GOT ME. SLAP THE CUFFS ON, OFFICER TOFU. EATING MEAT IS BAD FOR YOU. OF COURSE, I DON'T ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF PETTY SCHADENFREUDE, SO IT BRINGS ME ABSOLUTELY NO PLEASURE TO TELL YOU THAT THE SAME HOT DOG STUDY I MENTIONED EARLIER ALSO FOUND THAT 10% OF VEGETARIAN HOT DOGS CONTAIN MEAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S RIGHT! THAT'S RIGHT! YOU KNOW THAT TIME YOU THOUGHT YOU TASTED SOMETHING FLAVORFUL? THAT WAS THE MEAT. KEEP IN MIND-- RIGHT, RIGHT? AM I RIGHT. AND KEEP IN MIND, NOT JUST ANY MEAT, BECAUSE IN TWO-THIRDS OF ALL VEGETARIAN HOT DOGS, THEY ALSO FOUND HUMAN D.N.A. TWO-THIRDS! TOFU DOGS ARE PEOPLE! THEY'RE PEOPLE! SO, VEGETARIANS, STICK THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH HILLARY CLINTON. ♪ DON'T MEAN A THING IF IT AIN'T GOT THAT SWING ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FRONTRUNNER FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. PLEASE WELCOME HILLARY CLINTON! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> MY FIRST VISIT TO THE CATHEDRAL OF COLBERT. >> Stephen: YES. DO YOU LIKE WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE? >> I LOVE IT, ACTUALLY. I'M REALLY IMPRESSED, ESPECIALLY THE STAINED GLASS. >> Stephen: YEAH IT'S A FIXER-UPPER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY. YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND EVERYTHING. >> YEAH, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE. >> Stephen: IT'S A FULL-TIME JOB.  ( APPLAUSE ) AND I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I KNOW YESTERDAY WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY. >> IT WAS. ABSOLUTELY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YUP, YUP. >> Stephen: DID YOU-- DID YOU DO ANYTHING SPECIAL LIKE HAVE A CELEBRATION FOR 11 HOURS? >> WELL, LET'S SEE, I SLEPT LATE. THAT WAS PRETTY CELEBRATORY. >> Stephen: THAT WAS NICE. >> I GOT TO DO AS LITTLE AS I COULD GET AWAY WITH. THAT WAS GOOD. I HAD -- >> WHAT IS THE LEAST YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH RIGHT NOW? ( LAUGHTER ) >> YOU KNOW, I HAD TO MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS. I HAD TO WATCH THE 11 HOURS ALL OVER AGAIN. NOT AT ALL. YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, AND I GOT TO SEE MY GRANDDAUGHTER OVER THE WEEKEND AND MY DAUGHTER AND EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS AND GOOD HEALTH. YOU CAN'T ASK FOR ANY MORE THAN THAT. AND THEN I JUST SORT OF HUNG AROUND. BILL AND I JUST KIND OF WATCHED BAD TV. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: NOT THIS SHOW. NOT THIS SHOW. >> NO, NO, BY DEFINITION NOT THIS SHOW. >> Stephen, OF COURSE,, OF COURSE,. >> A LITTLE BINGE WATCHING HERE AND THERE. >> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU BINGE WATCH? DO YOU HAVE A SHOW YOU LIKE? >> WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM AND WE FINALLY FINISHED "HOUSE OF CARDS." IT TOOK A WHILE BECAUSE WE WERE SLOW GOING. >> Stephen: DO YOU WATCH THAT SHOW AND EVERY YAWN GO, THIS. SO OLD HAT. >> ANOTHER MURDER. I MEAN, REALLY. AND WE DID-- I DO LIKE "MADAM SECRETARY." >> Stephen: OH, YOU DO, REALLY? I DO, ACTUALLY, I DO. >> Stephen: DON'T JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE IT'S A CBS SHOW. >> NO BECAUSE I WATCH "MADAM SECRETARY" AND I WATCH "GOOD WIFE." YEAH, YEAH. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE WATCH A LOT OF DIFFERENT ODDS AND ENDS. WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. >> Stephen: DO YOU EVER CALL THEM UP AND SAY WHERE IS MY RESIDUAL CHECK? WHERE IS MY ROYALTY? >> NO, BUT MADELEINE ALBRIGHT OFFICE AN EPISODE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. >> Stephen: SHE WAS. >> SHE WAS PLAYING HERSELF. >> Stephen: ARE YOU JEALOUS. >> Stephen: A LITTLE. >> Stephen: DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL SOMEBODY. I KNOW PEOPLE OVER THERE. >> I THINK I'D HAVE TO WAIT TO DO IT LATER. >> Stephen: MAYBE AFTER NOVEMBER? >> MAYBE AFTER NOVEMBER. >> Stephen: LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE-- WE'VE MET A COUPLE OF TIMES. >> WE HAVE. >> Stephen: BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU. THIS IS THE FIRST INTERVIEW WE'VE HAD. >> YES, YOU WERE IN YOUR ALTER EGO. >> Stephen: I WAS PLAYING A CHARACTER WHO DID NOT CARE FOR YOU. >> YES. WELL, I CAN SAY IT NOW. IT WAS MUTUAL. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) >> Stephen: NICELY DONE. NICELY DONE. SO I DON'T WANT REALLY KNOW YOU THAT WELL BUT LET'S GO OVER A LITTLE BIT OF THE C.V.. YOU GREW UP IN PARK RIDGE? >> I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO, A GREAT CITY. >> Stephen: I LIVED THERE FOR 11 YEARS. I LOVED CHICAGO. >> I LOVE CHICAGO. I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO, THEN MOVED TO A SUBURB CALLED PARK RIDGE WHERE I WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS, GOT MY FIRST JOBS WORKING IN THE PARK DISTRICT, GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL THERE THEN WENT OFF TO COLLEGE, WENT TO A WOMAN'S COLLEGE CALLED WELLESLEY OUTSIDE OF BOSTON, WELLESLEY COLLEGE. >> Stephen: WHERE, I UNDERSTAND, YOU WERE PRESIDENT OF THE YOUNG REPUBLICANS? >> YES, MY FIRST YEAR. IT'S TRUE. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: DID YOU SHOW UP IN THE WRONG ROOM ON SIGN-UP DAY? >> NO. YOU KNOW, MY-- MY FATHER-- THE GENDER GAP IN POLITICS STARTED IN MY HOUSE. >> Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. >> YES, MY FATHER WAS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN AND A REPUBLICAN, AND HE WAS VERY STAUNCH IN HIS VIEWS, AND WE WOULD HAVE LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE KITCHEN TABLE. MY MOTHER, WHO HAD A MUCH DIFFERENT UPBRINGING AND WAS, YOU KNOW, JUST A WONDERFUL PERSON, BUT HAD BEEN ABANDONED BY HER PARENTS AND WAS WORKING AS A HOUSE MAID WHEN SHE WAS 14. SO SHE CAME AT POLITICS AND LIFE WITH A MUCH MORE-- A BROADER PERSPECTIVE. SO I WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE GREAT DISCUSSIONS. AND SO I WAS -- >> SO YOU WENT TO COLLEGE ON YOUR DAD'S SIDE. >> I WENT TO COLLEGE ON MY DAD'S SIDE, THAT'S RIGHT, AS A YOUNG REPUBLICAN. AND THEN ONE DAY, I JUST KIND OF LOOKED AROUND AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW. I THINK I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS SOME MORE AND COME UP WITH MY OWN VIEWS. >> Stephen: DID THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BETTER PARTIES? IS THAT WHAT IT WAS? BECAUSE THAT'S WHY I BECAME A THEATER MAJOR. THEY HAD THE BETTER PARTIES. >> THE BEST PARTIES? MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT. NO, THEY WERE-- THEY WERE VERY EARNEST, YEAH. SO I HAD TO THINK THROUGH IT. BUT I EVENTUALLY BECAME A DEMOCRAT, YOU KNOW, WENT TO WORK ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE S. >> Stephen:  AND HOW DID THAT GO? >> IT WENT PRETTY WELL, YEAH. >> Stephen: BORN IN CHICAGO, SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: CHICAGO-STYLE PIZZA OR NEW YORK-STYLE PIZZA? AND DON'T WORRY, YOU WON'T OFFEND ANYONE WITH THIS ANSWER. >> NO, NOBODY. >> Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAK. >> I'M NOT GOING TO TELL A SOUL PUBLICLY BUT I'LL WHISPER IT IN YOUR EAR. ANYBODY WHO IS SMOKING BACON, YOU CAN TAKE IT? >> Stephen: WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON. STICK AROUND. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH HILLARY CLINTON. AS I SAID BEFORE, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO AREN'T FOLLOWING THE NEWS, YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> THAT'S RIGHT, I AM. >> Stephen: YOU LOOK IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT YOU'RE HAVING FUN. >> RIGHT, RIGHT. >> Stephen: IS IT FUN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? >> SOME DAYS. >> Stephen: YES. >> SOME DAYS. IT REALLY IS FUN. SOME DAYS IT'S JUST VERY HARD WORK, AND YOU DO SO MANY EVENTS, YOU DO KIND OF LOSE TRACK OF WHERE YOU ARE. BUT MOST DAYS, SOMETHING HAPPENS DURING THE DAY THAT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE, YES, I KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS. I AM SO COMMITTED. AND IT'S BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING TO ME ON A ROPE LINE. >> Stephen: THAT LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION-- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? ( LAUGHTER ) WHY DO YOU WANT-- THIS IS THE QUESTION TED KENNEDY COULD NOT ANSWER IN 1979. WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? >> I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MORE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE, TO LIVE UP TO THEIR OWN GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. AND THAT MEANS WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES. WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO MAKING THE ECONOMY WORK FOR EVERYBODY. AND WE HAVE TO DEFEND THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GAY RIGHTS AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT? ARE YOU-- THOSE ARE-- YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE NOBLE GOALS AND YOU ARE THE FIFTH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I HAVE HAD ON THE SHOW SO FAR, AND BERNIE SANDERS WAS SITTING THERE AND HE SAID MANY OF THE SAME THINGS. >> UH-HUH. >> Stephen: AND HIS ANSWERS ARE A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST ANSWER. AND IN THE DEBATE WITH SENATOR SANDERS, YOU SAID THE UNITED STATES IS NOT DENMARK. DENMARK HAS THOSE THINGS. AND THEY HAVE THOSE THINGS WITH HIGH TAXES ON THE MIDDLE CLASS. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: AND HOW WOULD WE ACHIEVE THEM IN THE UNITED STATES, ASIDE FROM THE POLITICAL PARALYSIS OF WASHINGTON, HOW DO YOU GET THOSE THINGS? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO PUTTING THE MIDDLE CLASS AT THE CENTER OF OUR POLITICS AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHAT HAS BEEN TRIED BY THE REPUBLICANS EVERY TIME THEY GET A CHANCE, CUTTING TAXES ON THE SUPER WEALTHY, GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF CORPORATIONS-- DOESN'T CREATE BROAD-BASED PROSPERITY. IT CREATES MORE INEQUALITY. AND I BELIEVE-- AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THIS-- THAT THE ECONOMY DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE TO WORK AGAINST SOME PLETY POWERFUL FORCES, BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE THERE. YOU'RE PUCHING BACK ALL THE TIME. THE MIDDLE CLASS IS ONE OF THE GREAT INVENTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY. I CAME OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER BUT MY DAD BECAME A SMALL BUSINESSMAN, AND I KNOW THIS IS POSSIBLE AND MUST EXIST IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY IS AS GREAT AS I THINK IT IS. SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK AND DO WHAT I KNOW WORKS, BUILD ON WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID, BECAUSE LOOK AT THE MESS HE INHERITED. YOU KNOW, I LOVE IT WHEN YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS ON HERE, AND THEY ACT LIKE WE ALL HAVE AMNESIA. I MEAN, WE IS IS HAD THE WORST FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND MY HUSBAND HANDED OVER 23 MILLION NEW JOBS, INCOMES RISING FOR EVERYBODY, A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT THE WORST ECONOMY WHERE WE WERE LOSING 800,000 JOBS A MONTH. SO WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO MAKING THE MIDDLE CLASS THE CENTER OF OUR POLITICS, RAISING INCOMES, AND GIVING KIDS A BETTER SHOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THAT'S A CHEAP TRICK SAYING THINGS PEOPLE LIKE ( LAUGHTER ). >> WELL, IT WAS THE WAY I WAS RAISE GLD YOU SAID 23 MILLION JOBS WERE HANDED OVER-- 23 MILLION JOBS WERE-- >> CREATED. >> Stephen: CREATED UNDER YOUR HUSBAND'S ADMINISTRATION. THE IMPLICATION OF THAT IS WE GET THE 90s BACK AGAIN IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> NO. >> Stephen: DO I HAVE TO WEAR PARACHUTE PANTS AND SLAP BRACELETS? ARE WE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO GET JIGY WITH IT? >> WELL, YOU'D LOOK PRETTY GOOD IN PARACHUTE PANTS. >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE THE HIPS FOR IT. >> I SAW YOU OUT HERE DANCING. JON, HE'S GOOD. I REALLY THINK SO. NO, WE'RE NOT GOING BACK. >> Stephen: IT'S NOT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 2.0. YOU'RE A DIFFERENT PERSON. >> I'M NOT RUNNING FOR MY HUSBAND'S THIRD TERM. I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S THIRD TERM. I'M RUNNING FOR MY FIRST TERM BUT I'M GOING TO DO WHAT WORKS AND WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WORKS. THE WEALTHY NEED TO PAY MORE. I'M SORRY TO BREAK IT TO YOU AND, YEAH, I MEAN-- ( APPLAUSE ) AND WE NEED -- >> I AM CONFLICTED RECENTLY. >> YES, I KNOW, I UNDERSTAND. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WE HAVE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. IT'S A POVERTY WAGE NOW. IT'S DISGRACEFUL THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING FULL TIME AND CAN'T GET OUT OF POVERTY. WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE MORE PROFIT SHARING. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REIN IN THE ABUSES IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, AND PARTICULARLY ON WALL STREET BECAUSE IT DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEMS WE HAD IN THE ECONOMY. SO ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE DONE. >> Stephen: YOU PUT FORTH A PLAN. >> DI. >> Stephen: FOR REFORMING WALL STREET, AND WALL STREET EMBRACED IT. IS THAT A GOOD SIGN? ( LAUGHTER ). >> WELL, I-- I'M NOT SURE WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I-- I CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET THAT MESSAGE IF THEY DID. PAUL KRUGMAN, YOU KNOW THE COLUMNIST FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES." >> Stephen: SURE. >> NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING ECONOMIST SAID I CAME OUT WITH A TOUGH, COMPREHENSIVE, EFFECTIVE PLAN BECAUSE WHAT I DID, WHICH IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE AND TRYING TO PREEMPT THE PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T JUST HAVE BIG BANKS IN OUR ECONOMY THAT PULL A LOT OF STRINGS AND MAKE A LOT OF DECISIONS. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN '08. WE HAD A BIG INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HAD TO BE BAILED OUT. WE HAD AN INVESTMENT BANK, LEHMAN BROTHERS, THAT FAILED. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND MY PLAN DOES THAT. >> Stephen: IF YOU'RE PRESIDENT. >> YES... >> Stephen: AND THE BANKS -- AND THE BANKS ARE FAILING, DO WE LET THEM FAIL THIS TIME? >> YES, YES. >> Stephen: WE LET THEM FAIL THIS TIME? >> YES, YES, YES, YES. >> Stephen: WOW. >> FIRST OF ALL, UNDER DODD-FRANK, THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN, BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE STRESS TESTS AND I'M GOING TO IMPOSE A RISK FEE ON THE BIG BANK IF THEY-- IF THEY ENGAGE IN WHAT-- RISKY BEHAVIOR. BUT THEY HAVE TO KNOW, THEIR EHOLDERS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT, YES, THEY WILL FAIL. AND IF THEY'RE TOO BIG TO FAIL, THEN UNDER MY PLAN-- AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED-- MAY HAVE TO BE BROKEN UP BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT, THEN IT'S MORE LIKELY TO FAIL.  ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: CAN YOU AT LEAST JUST GET BACK FROM THEM THE $3 THEY CHARGE US TO TAKE $20 OUT OF AN A.T.M. MACHINE? >> YOU KNOW WHAT? WE NEED TO GO AFTER THAT, TOO, DON'T YOU THINK? YEAH. >> Stephen: I DO, DO. >> YEAH, THAT'S USURRUOUS. >> Stephen: WHO WOULD YOU RATHER RUN AGAINST, DONALD TRUMP OR BEN CARSON? ( LAUGHTER ) >> I'M GOING TO LEAVE THAT TO THE REPUBLICANS. YOU THINK-- I-- I -- >> THE LIKELY CHOICE IS THOSE TWO GUYS. >> BUT IF I SAY ONE OR THE OTHER IT MIGHT INFLUENCE SOME PEOPLE AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON IT. I WANT THEM TO GO THROUGH WHATEVER THEIR PROCESS IS BECAUSE IF I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE THE NOMINEE, I WANT TO RUN HARD AGAINST WHICHEVER REPUBLICAN IS UP THERE. >> Stephen: BUT YOU CAN PICTURE EITHER ONE OF THEM IN THE OFFICE, RIGHT? YOU CAN PICTURE EITHER ONE OF THOSE GUYS IN THE OFFICE? ( LAUGHTER ). >> WELL, I-- I CAN-- I CAN PICTURE THEM IN SOME OFFICE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).  ( CHEERS ) >> Stephen: HALLOWEEN. HALLOWEEN IS COMING UP. AND YOUR CAMPAIGN HAS PUT OUT A COSTUME, A RECOMMENDED COSTUME. >> THEY DID NOT ASK ME ABOUT THIS. >> Stephen: THEY DID NOT. I WENT AHEAD AND DID IT. THIS IS YOU. WHERE ARE YOU HERE? >> Audience: OOOH! >> Stephen: YOU CAN DRESS UP FOR YOUR HALLOWEEN PARTY AS HILLARY CLINTON. YOU'LL REALLY SCARE YOUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS. >> NO, YOU'LL SCARE YOUR DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS. THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL. IF ANYBODY LEFT IN AMERICA HAS A PETER PAN COLLAR WHITE SHIRT AND A PLAID JUMPER, YOU CAN DO THAT. >> Stephen: YOU CAN GET THIS LOOK. LOOK RIGHT THERE. >> THAT'S CUTE OH, MY GOSH! >> Stephen: THIS IS YOU IN COLLEGE, RIGHT? IS THIS YOU IN COLLEGE OR LAW SCHOOL? >> NO, THAT'S ME IN COLLEGE. >> Stephen: I THINK THESE PANTS WERE A BAD ACID TRIP RIGHT THERE. AND YOU CAN GET THAT LOOK. >> THAT'S GOOD. >> Stephen: THIS-- THIS-- THIS IS ON YOUR CAMPAIGN'S WEB SITE. >> I CAN'T IMAGINE. >> Stephen: I CAN'T BELIEVE. THIS IS SCANDALOUS. >> YES, IT IS. >> Stephen: THEY'RE CALLING THIS ONE "THE HILLARY COLD SHOULDER." >> I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT THE DRESS IS CALLED, IT'S CALLED THE COLD SHOULDER DRESS. >> Stephen: YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT-- >> YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT -- >> BUT CUTTING THE SHOULDERS OUT OF A TURTLENECK AND THIS IS TWEETS FROM HILLARY. AND THAT'S ACHIEVABLE. BUT I THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ACHIEVE THE COSTUME, THE HILLARY CLINTON COSTUME, THIS HALLOWEEN, PEOPLE CAN JUST GO TO THE PARTY DRESSED UP ANY WAY THEY WANT BUT THEY HAVE TO STAY FOR 11 HOURS. >> THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE THAT. YEAH, YEAH. >> Stephen: WELL, MRS.  CLINTON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >> Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR CAMPAIGN. >> THANK YOU >> Stephen: HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT!

AND YOU CAN BE DAMN SURE IF I WASN'T ON TELEVISION WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING I'D BE WIMPERING AND YELPING LIKE A GUT-SHOT POODLE. >> ALL RIGHT, GOOD? VERY HAPPY, GUYS. THANK YOU.

WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF A HOMICIDAL SUSHI CHEF? >> IT'S AN ASPIRATIONAL BOOK, MEANING I-- ( LAUGHTER ) I WAS SITTING IN A SUSHI BAR IN NEW YORK, A REALLY GREAT ONE, AND WITH A SUSHI CHEF WHO I REALLY ADMIRE AND THREE WEALTHY KNUCKLEHEADS CAME IN, SAT DOWN, ORDERED SUSHI AND BEFORE IT ARRIVED POURED SOY SAUCE INTO THE DISH, TOOK A BIG WAD OF WASABI, AND I SAW MY SUSHI CHEF DYING INSIDE WITH RAGE AND UNHAPPINESS. AND I THOUGHT WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE WERE A FUTURE WHERE HE WOULD BE FREE TO REACH ACROSS THE COUNTER AND LOP THEIR HEADS OFF. I CREATED THIS TO -- >> INDULGE A FANTASY. >> YES. >> Stephen: YOU WERE A CHEF. DID YOU EVER WANT TO LOP SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF? >> EVERY DAY. >> Stephen: IF YOU'D LIKE TO INDULGE IN THE FANTASY THE BOOK IS... "GET JIRO, BLOOD AND SUSHI" AVAILABLE NOW. ANTHONY BOURDAIN, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, ANTHONY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ ( BAND PLAYING ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE LEAD GUITARIST OF THE ACCLAIMED ROCK BAND SLEATER-KINNEY, CO-STAR. AND CREATOR OF THE TV SERIES, "PORTLANDIA," AND NOW, AN AUTHOR. PLEASE WELCOME CARRIE BROWNSTEIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: HI. >> HI. >> Stephen: HOW ARE YOU? >> I'M GOOD, THANK YOU, HOW ARE YOU. >> Stephen: I'M DOING WELL. I'M DOING WELL. >> GOOD ( LAUGHTER ) LET'S MAKE THIS AWKWARD. >> Stephen: SURE. DO YOU ENJOY AWKWARD SITUATIONS? >> I DO, ACTUALLY. I LIKE OBSERVING AWKWARD SITUATIONS MORE THAN I LIKE BEING IN THEM. >> Stephen: OH, REALLY. >> WHAT ABOUT YOU? >> Stephen: I LIKE-- I LIKE FEELING EMBARRASSED. >> YOU DO? >> Stephen: I DO, YEAH. >> I DO A LITTLE BIT. DO YOU KNOW WALTER BENMEN. >> Stephen: I DON'T. >> HE'S A -- >> YOU'RE NAME DROPPING. >> I AM. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IMPROVISATION, AND HE SAID DECISIVE BLOWS ARE OFTEN STRUCK LEFT-HANDED, AND I THINK IS CONSIDER TRUE. >> Stephen: DECISIVE BLOWS ARE OFTEN STRUCK LEFT-HANDED. >> WHEN YOU'RE OFF BALANCE, WHEN YOU'RE USING SORT OF THE WEAKER PART OF YOURSELF, THE MORE UNEXPECTED PART OF YOURSELF, IS OFTEN WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR BEST. >> Stephen: WHAT'S THE WEAK, UNEXPECTED PART OF YOU? >> WHAT'S NOT. THERE ARE SO MANY. HOW CAN -- >> OH, COM. LET'S LOOK AT YOUR C.V.. YOU'RE A MUSICIAN, ACTOR, YOU YGUYS ARE BACK TOGETHER, YOU PUT OUT AN ALBUM. YOU'RE OFF RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU'RE ON YOUR BOOK TOUR. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: AND YOU'RE GOING TO TOUR AGAIN THROUGH DECEMBER. >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE ALSO WRITTEN A BOOK. I DON'T HEAR A LOT OF WEAK SPOTS HERE. THE BOOK IS CALLED "HUNGER MAKES ME A MODERN GIRL." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? HOW DOES HUNGER MAKE YOU A MODERN GIRL? HUNGER MAKES ME HANGRY. >> THAT WAS THE ALTERNATE TITLE BUT THE PUBLISHER DIDN'T WANT THAT. THAT'S TAKEN FROM A SLEATER-KINNEY SONG CALLED "MODERN GIRL." THERE ARE A LOT OF THEMES IN THE BOOK OF WANT, OF HUNGER, OF DESIRE, AND THE LACK THEREOF OF THOSE THINGS. AND IT'S KIND OF A STORY OF THE WAY THAT I FOUND COMMUNITY AND BELONGING THROUGH CREATIVITY AND MUSIC. SO HUNGER IS ONE OF THE THEMES. >> Stephen: WHAT WERE YOU HUNGRY FOR? WERE YOU HUNGRY-- DID YOU WANT TO BE A ROCK STAR? ARE YOU A ROCK STAR BY THE WAY? >> I'M A VERSION OF THE ROCK STAR. THAT SOUNDS SILLY TO SAY ONCE YOU KIND OF FRAME IT IN THAT WAY BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT ME THINKING, "I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE." >> Stephen: DOES THAT FEEL AWKWARD? >> YEAH. AND IT MAKES ME HUNGRY FOR JUST-- NO. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT PEOPLE FEEL SMALL. >> Stephen: FEEL SMALL? >> PEOPLE FEEL UNRECOGNIZED BY THEIR FAMILIES, BY THEIR FRIENDS, BUT THERE ARE WAYS PEOPLE I THINK FEEL KIND OF ALIENATED BY A LACK OF RECOGNITION, A LACK OF CONNECTION. AND I THINK A LOT OF THE BOOK IS ABOUT FINDING PEOPLE, FINDING A PLACE AND A PLATFORM TO HAVE A VOICE, TO FEEL THEY COULD BE HEARD. AND THAT IS PART OF THE JOURNEY OF SLEATER-KINNEY, AND EVEN "PORTLANDIA" FOR ME. >> Stephen: WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER PLATFORM WHERE YOU'RE HEARD IS "PORTLANDIA." IT'S A BRILLIANT SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND-- NOT EVERY MUSICIAN CAN ALSO DO COMEDY. I FOUND A LOT OF MUSICIANS I'VE SPOKEN TO REALLY SPEAK WITH THEIR MUSIC, NOT, YOU KNOW-- NOT WITH THE TALKIE-TALK. ( LAUGHTER ) WHICH DO YOU LIKE MORE? DO YOU LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAKING PEOPLE ROCK OUT OR MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH? >> YOU KNOW, I LIKE DOING BOTH, AND I FEEL FORTUNATE TO DO BOTH. I THINK I WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO COMEDY AND BEEN ABLE TO DO A LOT OF IMPROVISATION IF IT WEREN'T FOR MUSIC. I THINK THAT HELPED ME GAIN A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. IT GAVE ME FAITH IN SPONTANEOUS MOMENT, IN THE UNKNOWN, ABOUT GOING SOMEWHERE THAT COULD BE UNEXPECTED WHERE YOU MIGHT FAIL. COMEDY IS A LOT ABOUT THAT. >> Stephen: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) REALLY HURTS WHEN THEY DON'T LAUGH. >> YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) GUYS, THAT WAS YOUR CUE NOT TO LAUGH. >> Stephen: ARE YOU COOL? ( LAUGHTER ). >> AM I -- >> ARE YOU COOL? BECAUSE YOU SEEM COOL. ARE YOU COOL? >> NO MATTER WHAT I SAY RIGHT NOW, I FAIL. IF I SAY YES, AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, NO SHE'S NOT. AND IF I SAY NO, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, WELL, SHE'S UNDERMINING HERSELF. SO I'M KIND OF COOL SOME OF THE TIME IN MY OWN MIND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: CARRIE BROWNSTEIN'S BOOK IS "HUNGER MAKES ME A MODERN GIRL." IT'S OUT T TODAY >> Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW." NT TO THAN THANK LIANNE LE HAVAS FOR JOINING US.
