PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ON HIS FEET, 90 YEAR OLD CICELY TYSON WAS GOING, YAY! AND I'M SITTING BACKSTAGE THINKING BOY, I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT.

EXCEPT FOR THIS YEAR WHEN THEY DECIDED TO GO WITH VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE TONIGHT I AM JOINED BY ACTUAL VICTORIA SECRET ANGELS. PLEASE WELCOME ADRIANA LIMA, BAY-ATI PRINSLOO AND TAYLOR HILL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) VICTORIA SECRET ANGELS, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH. LOVELY TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE ALL OF YOU. NOW ANGELS, ANGELS, WELCOME, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME AWAY FOR BEING INTERMEDIARIES OF GOD AND MAN KIND TO MODEL LINGERIE. I HAVE TO ASK, WHAT IS VICTORIA SECRET. BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT VICTORIA SEEMS VERY PUBLIC.
OKAY, THE REAL SECRET IS SHE IS NOT ALLERGIC TO GLUTEN. SHE JUST LIKES TO BE VERY DIFFICULT AT RESTAURANTS.
Stephen: OKAY. THAT'S SHOCKING STUFF. WELL, AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT THE THREE OF YOU WERE GOING TO BE ON THE SHOW NATURALLY I KNEW THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING THAT AMERICA WANTED TO SEE VICTORIA SECRET ANGELS DO.
COULD IT BE MODELING THE DREAM ANGEL LACE TEDDY?
Stephen: NO, NO, BUT THANK YOU, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOVELY IDEA.
NO?
WHAT ABOUT WALKING THE RUNWAY IN THE DIAMOND ENCRUSTED $2 MILLION FANTASY BRA.
Stephen: AGAIN, AGAIN, I'M SURE THAT IS NICE.
NO, NO?
Stephen: BUT I'M GOING TO PASS. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE VICTORIA SECRET ANGELS DO.
EAT THE GIANT PILE OF BUFFALO WINGS.
Stephen: WE'VE GOT A WINNER. BRING IT OUT. (APPLAUSE) LADIES, THANK YOU. ANGELS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
ON YOUR MARKS,.
Stephen: VICTORIA SECRET ANGELS EATING A PILE OF BUFFALO WINGS. DIG IN LADIES, LET'S DO THIS THING. DON'T BE SHY.
THEY'RE SPICEY.
Stephen: I'LL TAKE ONE. GIVE ME ONE, RIGHT OVER HERE. NOW DON'T BE SHY. YOU NEED FUEL FOR YOUR BIG UNDERPANTS DAY TOMORROW. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY. STEPHEN.
WE RECORDED THIS SHOW A MONTH AGO.
Stephen: WELL THEN BELLY UP TO THE BUFFALO BAR, MY FRIEND.
THESE ARE SPICEY.
Stephen: THEY ARE SPICEY.
ARE THEY ORGANIC.
Stephen: THEY'RE BUFFALO WINGS, MY FRIENDS. THESE THINGS GO THROUGH YOU LIKE A BULLET TO TOKYO. ALL I KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE THE WINGS THAT WERE HARVESTED FROM ANGELS WITHOUT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT. LET ME GET ANOTHER ONE HERE. WE DON'T-- WE FORGOT PAPER TOWELS.
Stephen: EXCELLENT.
YOU'RE WELCOME. (LAUGHTER) OH, THAT IS THE SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE) THERE'S MORE STUFF ON THE PROMPTER BUT-- [BLEEP] IT, LET'S JUST GO. (  BAND PLAYING "LATE SHOW" THEME  )
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES STEVE CARELL. JENNIFER HUDSON. AND A PERFORMANCE FROM THE BROADWAY MUSICAL "THE COLOR PURPLE." FEETUREING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THANK YOU. THANKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN! STEPHEN, STEPHEN, STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU, BAND. YEAH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THOSE WINGS WERE SLIGHTLY SPICIER THAN THE ONES FROM REHEARSAL. OH MY GOODNESS. NOW WE WERE OFF LAST WEEK AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW TO DO THIS TONAL SHIFT RIGHT NOW. BUT I DO WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO START OFF TONIGHT BY TRYING TO CATCH UP ON THE TERRIBLE EVENTS THAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TEN DAYS. AND OFFER MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS TO THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO SPRINGS AND SAN BERNARDINO IN THE WAKE OF THESE TRAGIC TERRORIST ATTACKS. OF COURSE THESE DAYS EVEN THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS HAVE BECOME CONTROVERSIAL. JUST LOOK AT THIS COVER OF THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS FROM LAST WEEK. IT SAYS GOD ISN'T FIXING THIS. AND FOR ONCE, THEY'RE NOT REFERRING TO THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. NO, THEY'RE GOING AFTER POLITICIANS WHO FOLLOWING TACKS LIKE THESE OFFER WHAT THE PAPER HERE CALLS MEANINGLESS PLATITUDES. NOW FIRST, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO DEFEND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. AS SOMEONE WHO OCCASIONALLY THINKS AND PRAYS. THE REASON YOU KEEP PEOPLE IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS IS ADMITTEDLY NOT TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT TO TRY TO FIND SOME SMALL WAY TO SHARE THE BURDEN AND GRIEF. THE DAILY NEWS IS RIGHT, IF WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IT, WE CAN'T STOP THERE. SO WHAT DO WE DO? WELL LAST NIGHT DURING HIS SPEECH IN THE OVAL OFFICE BEHIND A PODIUM IN FRONT OF A DESK, THE PRESIDENT DECLARED THAT THE SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING WAS AN AGO OF TERRORISM. AND IT DOES MATTER WHAT THE MOTIVATION. IS BECAUSE WHEN WE DECIDE IT'S AN AGO OF TERRORISM, WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SOMETIMES TOO MUCH ABOUT IT. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THE NSA IS READING YOUR NETFLIX QUEUE AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY SAFETY NELT IS BEING SHIPPED IN PALLETS OF A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS TO BAGHDAD. BUT WHEN IT'S NOT A TERRORIST ATTACK, WE DO NOTHING. WHY CAN'T THERE BE ANYTHING IN BETWEEN? THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO MAKE IT HARDER TO BUILD UP AN ARSENAL. THE SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTERS HAD 6,000 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION. WHY IS IT SO EASY TO BUY BULLETS WHEN I HAVE TO SHOW THREE FORMS OF I.D. TO BUY SUDAFED. OF COURSE THE PEOPLE SAY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SOME PEOPLE SAY IF YOU OUTLAW GUNS, ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS. BUT THEN AT LEAST YOU WILL KNOW WHO THE OUTLAWS ARE. THEY ARE THE ONES WITH THE GUNS, GO GET THEM. ALSO, AND I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS BEFORE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. MAYBE EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A GUN. IF EVERYONE HAD A LOT OF TRAINING, IT MIGHT BE A DETERRENT. WE WOULD HAVE A SAFE, CIVIL SOCIETY THAT MIGHT NOT TURN INTO A 3 MILLION MAN MEXICAN STANDOFF. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF GUNS RIGHT NOW AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HELP, AND THAT IS SYRIA. EVERYONE AGREES THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ISIS. WE'VE TRIED BOMBING. BUT RECENTLY I SAW THIS NEWS ITEM. U.S. AIR FORCE RUNNING OUT OF BOMBS TO FIGHT ISIS. HOW DOES THE AIR FORCE RUN OUT OF BOMBS? THAT'S LIKE DENY'S RUNNING OUT OF CHOLESTEROL. NOW YOU KNOW THERE'S A NAME FOR AN AIR FORCE WITH NO BOMBS. IT'S CALLED AN AIRLINE. (LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: I DID NOT KNOW THIS-- APPARENTLY THE AIR FORCE HAS FIRED MORE THAN 20,000 BOMBS AND MISSILES IN SYRIA. AND 20,000 SOUNDS LIKE A LOT TO ME. SO I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT JUST BOMBING MIGHT NOT WORK. ISIS MIGHT BE UNCONVINCABLE BY THE BOOM BOOM ROOM. AND THIS MAY BE THE REASON WHY.
ISIS FIGHTERS MAY BE FUELED BY NOT JUST EXTREMIST IDEOLOGIES BUT ALSO BY A BLACK MARKET AMPHETAMINE THAT IS BECOMING POPULAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
JIHADIST FIGHTERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE USING IT AS A GO PILL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP AND IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WELL-BEING AND EUPHORIA AND YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE INVINCIBLE AND THAT NOTHING CAN HARM YOU.
Stephen: IT MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF NOTHING CAN HARM YOU. WELL, I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE WATCHING THE NEWS LATELY WHEN I SAY, CAN I HAVE SOME? NOW THE SPECIFIC DRUG IN QUESTION IS CALLED CAPTAGON, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED IN THE 1960s TO TREAT CONDITIONS SUCH AS HYPERACTIVITY. SO BASICALLY THEY'RE TAKE TAKING JIHADDERALL. AND CAPTAGON DOES THE JOB. ONE CAPTURED ISIS FIGHTER DESCRIBED ITS EFFECT THIS WAY. IT MAKES US FEEL BIG, STRONG, AS IF LOOKING AT THE BATTLE FROM ABOVE. YOU THINK THE TANKS ARE LITTLE BIRDS THAT YOU CAN DESTROY WITH YOUR SWORD. OF COURSE TO THE GUY IN THE TANK YOU LOOK LIKE A GUY WAVING A SWORD ABOUT TO BE RUN OVER BY A TANK. WHICH ALSO SOUNDS PRETTY TRIPPY. AND IT TURNS OUT SOME MEMBERS OF ISIS WERE ON THE DRUGS BEFORE THEY JOINED. CUZ ACCORDING TO FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY, THE PEOPLE, THEICIAN LAMB-- ISLAMIC STATE IS TRYING TO REACH ARE PEOPLE THAT AL-QAEDA WOULD NEVER USE AS AN OPERATIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN UNSTABLE, TROUBLED DRUG USERS. WHICH EXPLAINS A LOT. THESE EXTREMISTS WANTED TO GET INTO AL-QAEDA, THE HARVARD OF TERRORISM, BUT HAD TO SETTLE FOR THE SAFETY SCHOOL, ISLAMIC STATE. (LAUGHTER) NOW-- (APPLAUSE) NOW THAT WE KNOW THEY LIKE THE GO-GO PILLS, I THINK IT GIVES THE CLEAR PATH TO VICTORY AGAINST ISIS. WE JUST NEED TO FLOOD SYRIA WITH LESS OF THE SPIDERS ON YOUR FACE STABBY DRUGS, AND MORE OF THE PEATION AND LOVE DRUGS. I SAY WE SEND OUR BOMBERS OVER THERE TO DROP EXSTASY THEN CARPET BOMB THEM WITH PACIFIERS AND GLOWSTICKS. AND-- (APPLAUSE) AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, I SAY WE TACKLE ISIS HEAD ON WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND THEN FILL THOSE BOOTS WITH AMERICA'S BRAVEST TWEAKERS. YOU JUST TELL THEM THAT ISIS HAS GOT SOME OF THE HIGH SPEED CHICKEN FEED AND THEN LET THEM LOOSE. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE AS FEARLESS AS THEY ARE TOOTHLESS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH STEVE CARELL.
THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY AFLAC. IN JUST ONE DAY WE PROCESS, APPROVE AND PAY. ONE DAY PAY, ONLY FROM AFLAC. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: THAT'S A GREAT SOUND. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, MY FIRST GUEST HAS STARRED IN "THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN" "ANCHORMAN" AND "FOX CATCHER" HE NOW STARS IN "THE BIG SHORT" ABOUT THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE OF 2008.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M A MEAN GUY AND I'M PISSED OFF. YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE KIND OF CRAP PEOPLE ARE PULLING AND EVERYONE IS WALKING AROUND LIKE THEY ARE IN A DAMN VIDEO. THEY'RE ALL GETTING SCREWED, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT, THEY CARE ABOUT THE BALLGAME OR THEY CARE ABOUT WHAT ACTRESS JUST WENT INTO REHAB.

Stephen: YEAH. IN CHICAGO AN IMPROVISATIONAL THEATER. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR MEMORIES OF THAT TIME, LATE '80S AND EARLY 90s. WE WERING TO. ANY MEMORIES OF SECOND CITY, LIKE OUR TIMING TO BACK THERE?
I ALWAYS-- WELL, YOU UNDERSTUDIED ME, THE FIRST NAME MAIN STAGE SHOW SCZ FIRST TIME I WENT.
I PLAYED THE BAR I TONE HORN.
Stephen: YEAH.
AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE BAR I TONE HORN.
Stephen: SECOND CITY SAY REP SYSTEM, ANYBODY IN THE TOURING COMPANY, YOU GOT HIRED ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE I DID. AND THE TOURING COMPANY HAS TO GO IN FOR WHOEVER IS ON MAIN STAGE, LIKE YOU HAD TO GO IN FOR THE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU. BUT THE PART YOU WERE DOING, YOU PLAYED A BAR I TONE HORN, A FAT TRUM BET ---- TRUM PET.
YEAH.
Stephen: I NEVER PLAYED A BRASS INSTRUMENT AND THEY SAID ARE YOU ON NOR CARELL IN SIX DAYS, LEARN TO PLAY THE BARITONE HORN.
IT IS INCREDIBLE.
Stephen: YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING ON THE BARITONE HORN.
NOT SO MUCH BUT HAVING NEVER PLAYED IT, IN SIX DAYS.
Stephen: AND I HAD MY OWN BARITONE HORN BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T EVEN RENT ME THE HORN. I LEARNED IT IN SIX DAYS AND MY LIPS WERE JUST LIKE A BABOON'S ASS BECAUSE I HAD NO OMBU CHER. THE ONE THING I REMEMBERED, IT DRILLED IN MY HEAD, I WANTED THE GILG SO BADLY THAT I-- THE ANCHORS AWAY. CAN I NO LONGER HEAR ANCHORS AWAY, I CAN ONLY HEAR THE-BASE LINE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU PLAY. DO YOU REMEMBER IT.
YEAH.
Stephen: BA, BA, BA, BA, BA, BA ♪ ♪ ♪ BA, BA, BA ♪ ♪ BA, BA ♪ ♪ BA, BA, BA ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WHAT, THAT WAS 1990.
YEAH.
Stephen: 25 YEARS AGO. THAT IS HOW EMOTIONALLY SCARRING THAT WEEK WAS FOR ME.
BUT EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THAT SONG, IT'S THE ONLY PART YOU CAN HEAR.
Stephen: ABSOLUTELY.
SO WE DID COMEDYING TO FOR YEARS, YOU AND I DID THAT TOGETHER. THEN WE DID, THE DANA CARVY SHOW TOGETHER. WE WERE OFFICE MATE THERE.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: OFFICE MATES AT THE DAILY SHOW FOREVER.
YUP.
Stephen: YOU ARE POUND FOR POUND ONE OF THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO DRAMA, MAN? YOU'RE HURTING OUR FEELINGS.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME TO HAVE SOME PRETENSE IN MY LIFE.
Stephen: OKAY. HAVE YOU TRIED NOT PRONOUNCING THE LAST CONSONANT OF YOUR LAST NAME? THAT'S HOW I GET MINE IN.
I LIKE IT.
Stephen: YEAH. BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE TREMENDOUS WORK. OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU WANT TO DO IT, BECAUSE YOU CAN DO ANYTHING. PEOPLE ASK ME, LIKE WOW, IN "FOX CATCHER" HE WAS REALLY SCARY, I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. I SAID NO, I ALWAYS KNEW HE COULD PLAY A PSYCHOTIC.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
Stephen: YEAH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
WELL, I MEAN, RIGHT BACK AT YOU, THOUGH. THERE IS NO ONE-- SERIOUSLY, THERE IS NO ONE I WOULD RATHER PERFORM WITH THAN YOU.
Stephen: REALLY?
SERIOUSLY.
Stephen: REALLY.
TO BE ON-- BUT IT'S TRUE.
Stephen: WE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS.
CUZ I ALWAYS KNEW, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS, WE'RE ALWAYS FUNNY TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: I WILL TRY MY DRAMATIC CHOPS BE YOU RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO ON POINT AND SO GREAT AND YOU CAN-- I DON'T KNOW. EVERYONE'S BORED WITH US. (LAUGHTER).
Stephen: BUT I'M ENJOYING THIS CONVERSATION.
I AM TOO.
Stephen: THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. LET'S TALK ABOUT "THE BIG SHORT" FOR A SECOND. I'M FASCINATED BY THIS MOVIE. I LOVE THE IDEA OF THIS MOVIE. SO YOU PLAY A GUY, LET ME GET THIS, MARK BALM, ALL RIGHT, BASED ON A REAL HEDGE FUND MANAGER NAMED STEVE EISMAN, BEFORE THE 2008 CRASH.
UH-HUH.
Stephen: HE SEES SOMETHING COMING. WHAT DOES HE SEE COMING?
HE SAW THE BUBBLE. HE SAW THE HOUSING BUBBLE. HE SAW THAT ALL OF THESE MORTGAGES WERE GOING TO DEFAULT AND HE AND A-- .
Stephen: A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SAW IT WITH HIM.
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE SAW IT COMING AND ESSENTIALLY BET AGAINST THE U.S. ECONOMY.
Stephen: AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THEY WERE CRAZY.
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT THEY WERE CRAZY AND IT'S WEIRD WATCHING THE MOVIE. YOU THINK WHO ARE THE HEROES HERE. BECAUSE YOU KIND OF ROOT FOR THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE IN AMERICA.
Stephen: YOU KNOW THAT IF THE HEROES OF OUR MOVIE ACTUALLY GET WHAT THEY WANT, ACTUAL OF US LOSE.
EXACTLY. AND YOU STILL KIND OF ROOT FOR IT.
Stephen: WHEN YOU WERE WALKING AROUND ON THE MOVIE, THIS IS-- WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE, WHAT TERRIFIED ME WAS, I HAD FORGOT ENHOW CLOSE WE CAME TO A GLOBAL MELTDOWN. LIKE $17 TRILLION DISAPPEARED OVERNIGHT BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.
IT, WELL, AND HAD THE GOVERNMENT NOT BAILED OUT THE BANKS, WHO KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THERE. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AT THE TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU READ THE PAPER AND YOU WATCH THE NEWS. BUT THE EXTENT OF IT, I HAD NO IDEA.
Stephen: SO YOU DID NOT-- YOU DON'T REALLY DEEPLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS.
ANYTHING.
Stephen: ANYTHING, RIGHT. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT, THAT THAT IS A VERY ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF WALL STREET IN 2008.
THANK YOU.
Stephen: REALLY GOOD WORK. REALLY GOOD WORK. (APPLAUSE) AND THE MOVIE IS WITH ADAM McKAY, WHO "ANCHORMAN" ONE AND TWO. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF DOING "ANCHORMAN" WITH HIM AND DOING A DRAMA ABOUT THE WORLDWIDE COLLAPSE OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
IT'S ACTUALLY CLOSER THAN YOU WOULD THINK. BECAUSE ADAM, WHEN WE WERE DOING "ANCHORMAN" HE IS THE FUNNIEST GUY, HE SITS BEHIND A MONITER WITH A MICROPHONE AND SHOUTS OUT THINGS LIKE, I POOPED A DHOK LAT SCWIREL. AND YOU SAY THAT, NOT IN THIS MOVIE AND THE BUT THE OTHER MOVIE. AND YOU JUST SAY THINGS THAT HE SAYS. AND HE'S INCREDIBLY SMART AND FUNNY. FOR THIS MOVIE, HE STILL HAD HIS MIC BUT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.
Stephen: HE'S LIKE GO, IMPROVISE ABOUT, YOU KNOW.
DERIFF TIFFS AND.
YEAH, AND YOU WOULD TRY TO HAVE SOME THINGS IN YOUR BACK POCKET THAT YOU COULD THEN IMPROVISE ON.
Stephen: COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, MAKE IT EXCITING, GO.
EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
Stephen: CAN YOU STICK AROUND. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LITTLE BREAK HERE BUT DON'T GO AWAY.
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW-- OKAY, I WILL. ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE STEVE CARELL. (APPLAUSE) CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH OUR OLD FRIEND STEVE CARELL. IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU BECAUSE SEEING YOU REMINDED ME OF SOME OF THE REALLY CRAPPY JOBS WE USED TO DO TOGETHER. BECAUSE WHEN ARE YOU STARTING OFF, COMEDIANS AT SECOND CITY, THEY DIDN'T PAY US ANYTHING, LIKE $75 A SHOW, WHICH MAYBE YOU HAD A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.
RIGHT.
Stephen: HE SO WE WOULD DO ANY JOOB, DO YOU REMEMBER THE INDUSTRIALS WE DID TOGETHER.
DO YOU REMEMBER NOVEL.
Stephen: FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW, AN INDUSTRIAL IS FOR A CORPORATION ONLY FOR THEIR REST. WE GOT HIRED BY A COMPANY CALLED NOVEL NETWORK MANAGEMENT.
RIGHT.
Stephen: AND WE WROTE SOMETHING CALLED THE CIRCUS OF INFORMATION. AND WE DID A HUGE.
IT WAS THREE RINGS OF NOVEL.
Stephen: THE THREE RINGS OF NOVEL, A TRADE SHOW IN BOSTON WE DID, EXACTLY. AND WE WROTE A 45 MINUTE SHOW AND IT WASN'T UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE WE WENT ON STAGE WE REALIZED THAT WE HADN'T WRITTEN ONE LINE FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER)
I WAS JUST ACTING.
Stephen: WERE YOU ACTING OUT EVERYTHING I WAS SAYING BECAUSE WERE YOU THE RING MASTER AND YOU WERE THE LION AND THE CLOWN AND I REALIZED I HAD LIKE FOUR HOURS TO MEM ORIZE A 45 MINUTE MONOLOGUE.
I WAS SO HAPPY. LIKE EASIEST $75 BUCKS I EVER MADE.
Stephen: I COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. I WOULD JUST GO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! YEAH!
AND PEOPLE KNEW, PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE KNEW, CUZ-- .
Stephen: THE NOVEL, YES, OOHH. NETWORK SHAREWARE MANAGEMENT! OBSERVE! (LAUGHTER) DID YOU-- DID YOU HAVE TO GAIN WEIGHT FOR THIS MOVIE?

Stephen: YEAH.
DEEP DISH PIZZA, THAT WILL DO IT.
Stephen: OH YEAH.
YOU CAN ORDER IT FROZEN FROM ANY NUMBER OF FINE ESTABLISHMENTS IN CHICAGO.
Stephen: YEAH.
AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO COOK IT. IF YOU JUST SUCK ON A FROZEN PIECE OF PIZZA.
Stephen: THE THING ABOUT DEEP DISH PIZZA T IS EASY IF IT'S DEEP ENOUGH YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT ON A SNORKEL AND DIVE INTO THE PIE. IT'S LIKE A BABY POOL FILLED WITH CHEESE. AND SAUCE. AND YOU TRIED TO STAY HEALTHY. WAS IT LIKE, WERE YOU AFRAID TO GO BACK TO, YOU KNOW, RELAXED CARELL? BECAUSE ARE YOU VERY DISCIPLINED NOW.
IT WAS-- IT WAS REALLY FUN.
Stephen: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SAY OH, I MISS WORKING OUT, IT WAS TERRIBLE, I FELT BAD ABOUT MYSELF AND UNHEALTHY. IT WAS SO GREAT! TO JUST EAT JUNK ALL THE TIME.
Stephen: NOW DID YOU GET-- DID YOU GET FAT ENOUGH FOR ADAM McKAY. DID YOU GET AS FAT AS HE WANTED YOU?
THE FIRST DAY I SHOWED UP ADAM SAID WOW, WERE YOU NOT KIDDING AROUND. WHICH IS A REALLY ODD COMPLIMENT TO GET.

I GAVE IN TO THE CHOCOLATE BEFORE I GOT HERE. SEE THAT'S THE TRICKY THING WITH BROADWAY, FOR ME, I COME FROM THE WORLD OF TELEVISION. AND SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE ARE YOU EATING RIT BEFORE YOU STEP ON THE RED CARPET OR IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. BUT ON BROADWAY THERE IS NO CAMERA, SO I CAN EAT A LITTLE BIT MORE CHOCOLATE.
Stephen: REALLY, ANYTHING GOES.

Stephen: I DO LOVE WHAT I DO.
I I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT OR A MUSICIAN OR A PHOTOGRAPHER, ANYTHING THAT YOU DO, I THINK IS SO INSPIRING WHEN YOU ARE A PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT. IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.
Stephen: IT MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE.

Stephen: WELL, IN THE NEW MUSICAL "THE COLOR PURPLE" YOU PLAY SHU G AVERY. AND YOU SAID THIS IS DIFFERENT, THIS IS THE MOST DIFFERENT CHARACTER YOU HAVE EVER PLAYED.

FOR THE MOST PART, EVERYTHING HAVE I DONE HAS BEEN REALLY HEAVY IN A WAY, DRAMATIC, EMOTIONAL. NEVER GLAMOROUS AND SHUG IS A GLAMOR GIRL, HONEY. SO THAT'S FUN TO BE ABLE TO EXPLORE IN THAT WAY. AND I DO ATTRIBUTE PART OF IT TO MY WEIGHT LOSS AND MY NEW APPEARANCE, YOU KNOW. CUZ WHEN THEY CALLED ME ABOUT PLAYING-- BEING IN "COLOR PURPLE" I WAS LIKE SURE, WHEN THEY SAID SHUG AVERY, I SAID HUH, ME AS THE SEX KITTY, I AM LIKE REALLY?

WELL, WITH THE BROADWAY AUDIENCE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY BRING THE GIFT OF THE ENERGY TO THE SHOW. AND IT'S LIKE ANOTHER CHARACTER IN THE SHOW. YEAH, IT IS VERY DIFFERENT. BUT TIMES WE NEVER KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GET. ONE DAY SOMEBODY DECIDED TO MOVE THE PROP. AN AUDIENCE MEMBER DECIDED TO MOVE THE PROP. WE WERE ON STAGE SO EVERY NIGHT WE'RE LIKE-- .
Stephen: WENT UP ON STAGE.
HE GOT UP, AND WAS LIKE THIS IS IN MY WAY. AND WE HAVE TO IGNORE ALL OF THAT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT.
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
Stephen: HE WAS SHOWING PASSION.
HE WAS SHOWING PASSION.
Stephen: EXACTLY RIGHT.
HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT SEE THAK SHOW.
Stephen: YOU HAVE TO RESPECT IT AND HAVE SECURITY REMOVE HIM. BUT RESPECT IT AT THE SAME TIME.
YEAH, YEAH.
