I AM STEPHEN COLBERT AND I AM SO EXCITED BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND IS THE KENTUCKY DERBY, THE ONE DAY A YEAR WHEN IT'S LEGAL TO BET ON THREE-YEAR-OLDS. LAST YEAR'S DERBY AND TRIPLE CROWN WINNER, AMERICAN PHAROAH, RETIREMENT. LOOK AT THIS HEADLINE. "AMERICAN PHAROAH IS ALREADY A CHAMPION AT THE STUD LIFE, TOO." THAT' THAT'S RIGHT, HE IS-- TO USE A POPULAR EUPHEMISM-- GOOD AT SEX. APPARENTLY, AMERICAN PHARAOH BREEDS IN THE MORNING, THE AFTERNOON, AND SOMETIMES EVEN AT 6:00 P.M., EACH TIME WITH A DIFFERENT MARE. THAT IS A LOT OF AWKWARD "TROTS OF SHAME." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THREE TIMES A DAY. I DO NOT ENVY THE JOCKEY THAT HAS TO RIDE HIM THE WHOLE TIME, OR THE GUY ANNOUNCING IT: "AND AMERICAN PHARAOH IS COMIN' UP FROM BEHIND. AND HE'S STILL COMING UP FROM BEHIND. AND HE REALLY SEEMS TO LIKE IT BACK THERE." ( LAUGHTER ) AND HE'S LETTING HER FINISH FIRST. AND-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S JUST POLITE. IT'S JUST NICE. SPEAKING OF KENTUCKY, K.F.C. HAS JUST RELEASED FRIED-CHICKEN- FLAVORED NAIL POLISH. IT IS FINGER LICKIN' POSSIBLY TOXIC. ( LAUGHTER ) PERSONALLY, I THINK IT'S FITTING TO MAKE OUR FINGERS TASTE LIKE CHICKEN, BECAUSE GIVEN HOW FAST MOST OF US PLOW THROUGH K.F.C., WE DON'T STOP UNTILL WE GET TO THE WRIST. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS DELICIOUS, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI.

( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) NO I'M READY TO DO THE SHOW. YOU KNOW, MOTHER'S DAY IS COMING UP THIS WEEKEND, OR AS MOST PEOPLE PUT IT, THIS WEEKEND! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE WELCOME, BY THE WAY. OF COURSE, FINDING JUST THE RIGHT MOTHER'S DAY CARD CAN BE DIFFICULT. BUT EVEN IF YOU FIND IT, IT DIDN'T START THAT WAY. SOMEBODY HAD TO WRITE THE SENTIMENT ON THE CARD, AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT ON THE FIRST TRY. SO TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE EARLY DRAFTS OF MOTHER'S DAY CARDSES IN OUR FIRST SEGMENT "FIRST DRAFTS." >> NO, STUPID. >> Stephen: NOW, THIS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO HERE IS A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED TALK SHOW DESK PIECE, MEANING I'M GOING TO HOLD UP PICTURES OF THE MOTHER'S DAY CARDS AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE JOKES ON THEM.

HERE'S A CARD THAT SAYS, "I'M SO LUCKY YOU'RE MY MOM!" BUT THE ORIGINAL DRAFT HAD ON THE INSIDE, "BUT STOP CALLING BEFORE 9:00 A.M. I THOUGHT SOMEONE DIED." THAT'S TRUE. WHEN FAMILY-- WHEN FAMILY CALLS EARLY IN THE MORNING, LATE AT NIGHT, YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BAD NEWS, NEVER GOING TO BE GOOD. WHAT YOUR KIDS' NAMES. >> JASON, AND AARON. >> Stephen: IS AARON A BOY OR A GIRL. >> AND I HAVE THREE GRANDSONS. >> Stephen: GET OUT! YOU HAVE A GRANDSON ALREADY? >> I DO.

BUT IN THE ORIGINAL DRAFT IT SAID, "DAD JUST GOT HIT BY A MINIVAN." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S TERRIBLE.

LAURENCE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> IT WAS A PLEASURE BEATING YOU. >> Stephen: I'LL SEE YOU IN HELL. THAT DOES IT FOR... >> Audience: FRIDAY NIGHT FIGHTS! >> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH COMEDIAN RYAN HAMILTON. WELL PLAYED, MY FRIEND. >> Stephen: MY NEXT GUEST IS A VERY FUNNY MAN WHO'S BEEN NAMED ONE OF "ROLLING STONE'S" "FIVE COMICS TO WATCH." PLEASE WELCOME RYAN HAMILTON. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> WOW, THANK YOU! THIS IS NICE. IT'S-- IT'S NICE TO TALK TO PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY. I DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY ALL DAY, AND THEN I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, LIKE, MILLIONS TODAY, AND THEM I DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY. IT'S A WEIRD WAY TO LIVE. I FEEL LIKE I'M WAKING UP OUT OF A DEAD SLEEP INTO A SPRINT, YOU KNOW. I'M JASON BOURNING INTO EVERY CONVERSATION. I TRIED TO CANCEL MY GYM MEMBERSHIP. YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF A LAZIER STATEMENT IN YOUR LIFE THAN, "I TRIED TO CANCEL MY GYM MEMBERSHIP?" YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF THIS. I'VE WALKED OFF STREET GANGS EASIER THAN CANCELLING GYM MEMBERSHIPS. I CALLED THIS GUY, AND HE SAID, "IF YOU REALLY WANT TO CANCEL, THERE ARE TWO WAYS." NO, THERE'S JUST ONE WAY. ( LAUGHTER ) I TELL YOU, AND THEN YOU DO IT. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY. WE'RE ACTUALLY HALFWAY DONE RIGHT NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU WOULD JUST MEET ME IN THE MIDDLE, WE COULD CLOSE THE CASE ON THIS ONE YOU KNOW. HE SAID, "THE FIRST WAY IS YOU CAN COME IN AND CANCEL IN PERSON." NOPE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NOT THAT ONE. YOU WANT TO HAVE A MEETING? WHAT IS THAT CONVERSATION GOING TO BE? "AS YOU CAN SEE I SPENT $2600 ON FOUR WORKOUTS." NOW, FROM WHERE I'M STANDING, THE GROUNDS FOR CANCELLATION ARE PRETTY SOLID, YOU KNOW. I'VE BEEN CRUNCH SOMETHING NUMBERS OVER HERE, AND I'M ON A QUARTERLY WORKOUT PLAN, AND IT'S FEELING A LITTLE FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE JUST LET ME OUT, PLEASE, LET ME OUT. I DON'T USE MY GYM. DO YOU USE YOUR GYM? I WARNED IN EVERY THREE MONTHS AND GO, "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS." MY ENTIRE WORKOUT THE WHOLE THING-- THIS IS THE DISCIPLINE I HAVE-- THE WHOLE THING IS BASED ON WHATEVER MACHINE IS OPEN. THAT'S HOW I DO IT. I WALK AROUND LIKE A LOST TODDLER FOR THREE AND A HALF MINUTES, AND THEN I GO, "I GUESS I'M GOING TO DO NECK TODAY. JUST GOING TO DO ALL NECK." ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH. I'M JUST GOING TO BANG OUT A FEW ON THE SCOLIOSIS MACHINE OVER HERE. "HEY, SHOULD I SIGN ANOTHER WAIVER, BECAUSE THIS FEELS DANGEROUS." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S ALL I DO. I DO THREE SETS OF NECK, BOTH SIDES, AND THEN I GO HOME. AND IT COSTS $750. SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE LET ME OUT, JUST PLEASE. HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T WANT TO COME IN AND CANC NEL PERSON, THERE'S A SECOND WAY." OH, I'M ON PINS AND NEEDLES OVER HERE. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR ABOUT THE SECOND WAY TO CANCEL MY GYM MEMBERSHIP. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID-- "YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER." HE DIDN'T LAUGH AFTER HE SAID THAT. WRITE A LETTER? I WAS FURIOUS. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I DIDN'T SIGN THIS CONTRACT DURING THE CIVIL WAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WE DON'T WRITE LETTERS-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW. DO YOU KNOW HOW? I WAS AT HOME GOOG LING "HOW DO YOU WRITE A LETTER?" ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) "DEAR MY GYM, I FEEL THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO PART WAYS. ALTHOUGH YOUR NECK MACHINE HAS PROVEN CHALLENGING, I FEEL THE COST HAS BECOME EXORBITANT. FURTHERMORE, WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE ON TUESDAY, AND THIS LETTER IS REDUNDANT. PLEASE LET ME OUT. SINCERELY PRIVATE RYAN T. HAMILTON." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU TO WRITE A LETTER IN 2016, THEY'RE BULLYING YOU. THAT'S HOW-- I FELT BULLY. I HAD TO BUY 50 ENVELOPES IN ORDER TO WRITE... ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T EVEN HAVE LETTER WRITING STUFF. I WAS WANDERING AROUND MY APARTMENT GOING, "MAYBE I COULD MAKE AN ENVELOPE OUR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAYBE I COULD CULL TOGETHER SOME OF THESE RAW MATERIAL. BUT I HAVE 49 ENVELOPES LEFT. IT IS A LIFETIME OF ENVELOPES. MY CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WILL HAVE ENVELOPES. THEY'LL BE TALKING STORIES ABOUT HOW THEIR GRANDFATHER WALKED TO THE CVS IN A FULL-ON RAGE AND BROUGHT BACK THIS NOW-TATTERED BOX OF ENVELOPES SO THAT WE COULD ALSO CANCEL OUR GYM MEMBERSHIPS. AND BY THE WAY, HE HAD TO WALK BY HIS GYM IN ORDER TO PURCHASE THEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'VE BEEN REALLY GREAT. I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. ♪ ♪ ♪ >> Stephen: HE'S NOW ON TOUR ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. RYAN HAMILTON, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THAT'S IT FOR THE "LATE SHOW." TUNE IN MONDAY WHEN MY GUESTS WILL BE KALEY CUOCO, DAN SAVAGE, AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY "THE NATIONAL." GOOD NIGHT!
