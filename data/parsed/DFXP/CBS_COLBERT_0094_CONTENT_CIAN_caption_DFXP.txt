BUT THE JUDGES DID GIVE HER HIGH MARKS FOR HER PRONOUNCED FATTY TUMORS. >> Stephen: AND HOW DID SHE DO?

COME ON NOW! WHAT'S A MAN TO DO. >> Jon: WHAT'S THAT? >> Stephen: WHAT'S A MAN TO DO? YOU KNOW WHAT, FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH. I WATCH THE NEWS A LOT, I WATCH THE NEWS A LOT, AND IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY OBVIOUS THAT OUR POLITICS IS A CONTACT SPORT. IT'S MANO A MANO BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO WOULD DEPORT YOU IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE PHRASE "MANO A MANO." THE CANDIDATES ARE CURRENTLY BATTLING IT OUT FOR THE GENTEEL VOTERS OF SOUTH CAROLINA. MY HOME STATE. OH, HOW I MISS YOU! I LOVE YOU! SAVE ME SOME SHRIMP! ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S HOW WE ALL TALK DOWN THERE. I LOVE YOUR PEACHES! ( LAUGHTER ) BERNIE SANDERS HAS BEEN FIGHTING AN UPHILL BATTLE AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON AND DONALD TRUMP IS BATTLING WITH ANYONE WHO MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH HIM. WHICH MEANS THE ONLY ONE WHO'S SAFE IS BEN CARSON. AND STOKING THE FIRES OF POLITICAL DISCONTENT IS THE MEDIA. YOU SEE, FOR PEOPLE ON TV CONFLICT IS OUR BRED AND BUTTER, AND AMERICA IS BOTH GLUTEN AND AND AMERICA IS BOTH GLUTEN AND LACTOSE INTOLERANT. BUT WE DON'T CARE. OTHERS MUST SUFFER FOR US TO HAVE OUR BLOODSPORT. IT'S LIKE "THE HUNGER GAMES." NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S... "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." WELCOME! YES, YES. WELCOME, CITIZENS, ALL TO THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." TRIBUTES, ASSEMBLE! OH, THERE THEY ARE. THERE THEY ARE. VYING TO BE CHAMPION OF CAPITAL CITY. OH, HOW THEIR RANKS ARE THINNING! THE FIELD IS GETTING ALMOST AS SMALL AS L.G.B.L.T. VOTERS FOR TED CRUZ. HE'S NO FRIEND OF CORRIDOR THEE. BEFORE I CONTINUE, I WANT TO INTRODUCE MY NEW CO-HOST, CALIGULA. CALIGULA HERE, HE IS LIKE MANY-- HE IS LIKE MANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. WHEN HE FIRST APPEARS ON THE SCENE, HE SEEMS FIERCE, BUT FIRST YOU REALIZE DEAD ON ARRIVAL. HE'S FINE, HE'S FINE. NOW, CITIZENS, WHEN LAST WE MET, I NEGLECTED TO... SORRY. MY MOUTH COULDN'T WAIT. I HAVE A REAL-- I HAVE A PROBLEM! ANYWAY, I NEGLECTED TO BID FAREWELL TO ONE OF OUR BOLDEST CONTESTANTS, FORMER PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR AND SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER WHO ASSIGNS HOMEWORK, RICK SANTORUM, WHO RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HIS WITHDRAWAL FROM THE RACE. OF COURSE< AS A GOOD CATHOLIC, WITHDRAWAL IS THE ONLY METHOD HE APPROVES OF. NO, NO, NO! AS FOR THE REST, LAST WEEK, THEY PITCHED OPEN BATTLE IN THE ARENA OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. SADLY, FOR MANY TRIBUTES, VOTERS IN THE "LIVE FREE OR DIE" STATE SAID, "MMM, DIE." ( LAUGHTER ) THE BLOOD-LETTING BEGAN WITH NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR AND QUASIMODO'S HANDSOME BROTHER, CHRIS CHRISTIE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MMM! MMMM! IN THE GRANITE STATE, HE HOSTED 76 TOWN HALLS AND ATTENDED 180 PUBLIC EVENTS. HE REALLY MINGLED WITH THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. BUT, EVIDENTLY, TO KNOW HIM IS TO "HIM? NO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHRISTIE WAS CAMPAIGNING ON HIS BLUNT OUTSPOKENNESS, EVEN ADOPTING THE SLOGAN, "TELLING IT LIKE IT IS." SADLY, DONALD TRUMP STOLE HIS THUNDER BY TELLING IT LIKE A NYQUIL-INDUCED FEVER DREAM? BUT THE GOVERNOR SHALL NOT GO ALONE INTO THAT DARK NIGHT BECAUSE HE'S BEING JOINED BY SEVENTH-PLACE FINISHER, CARLY FIORINA. YES, THE VOTERS' REACTION TO THE FORMER HEWLETT-PACKARD C.E.O. WAS CONTROL-ALT-GOOD-BYE. OH, CARLY, WE HARDLY KNEW-LY! BUT SHE BRAVELY STEPPED DOWN, VIA FACEBOOK POST, FACEBOOKING, "TO YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY, I SAY DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE... ALL RIGHT, I WON'T, THEN. MOVING ON. SADLY, I HEAR AND I ABOY. I HEAR AND I OBEY. BUT, SADLY, NOT ALL IS FUN AND GAMES IN THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES," BECAUSE TONIGHT, TRAGICALLY, WE MUST SAY GOODBYE TO A MAN WHO HAS, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, BEEN THE FRONTRUNNER OF LAST PLACE, FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR JIM GILMORE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IS THAT HIM? IS THAT HIM? I HOPE SO. HE LOOKS GOOD. HE LOOKS GOOD. OH, THERE YOU GO. HERE I GO. THE GILMENTUM HAS BECOME GILNERTIA, POSSIBLY GILMENTIA. THIS ONE HITS HOME ESPECIALLY HARD. FOR ME AND CALIGULA HERE. WE THOUGHT HE WAS UNKILLABLE. AFTER ALL, GILMORE DIDN'T DROP OUT AFTER IOWA, WHERE HE GOT A TOTAL OF 12 VOTES. THEY DIDN'T NEED COMPUTERS TO COUNT HIS VOTES. THEY USED DOUGHNUTS. BUT THEN HE WENT ON TO SURGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH 133 VOTES! THAT'S OVER 11 TIMES AS MANY. WHY DID YOU DROP OUT, GOVERNOR? AT THAT RATE, JUST SEVEN STATES LATER, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ( LAUGHTER ) 2.5 BILLION VOTES, WHICH IS ONE FOR EVERY PIG THAT WOULD HAVE FLOWN OVER YOUR INAUGURATION. A LOT OF GILMORE VOTERS HERE TONIGHT, EVIDENTLY. AS IS OUR CUSTOM, LET US BID FAREWELL TO THE FALLEN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) FAREWELL, BRAVE TRIBUTES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FAIR WELL. YOUR VALOR WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. AND YOUR CAMPAIGN DEBTS WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KATE HUDSON. >> Stephen: HEY, WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY!

I'M LIKE, "GUYS, CALM DOWN. LET'S STOP." YOU DO THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THEN YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR SHOIS VOICE. THEN IT'S, "STOP! GET DOWN! STOP IT!" IT TURNS INTO THAT. AND THEN THEY DO. AND THEN IT TURNS INTO, LIKE, KICKING AND THINGS AND THEY'RE HITTING EACH OTHER. AND THEN I'M LIKE, "GUYS, GUYS." AND FOR SOME REASON RIDER DID SOMETHING TO BING AND PING STARTED TO CRY. AND I'M GOING, "BING, STOP CRYING. THERE'S NO REASON TO CRY." AND THEN IT'S HE HIT ME. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW BING IS NOT SICK, HE'S NOT ILL. HE JUST THROWS UP. AND I LOVE MY BED.

WOULDN'T CHANGE IT FOR THE WORLD. >> Stephen: AND YOU HAVE A VERY HAPPY LIFE. >> AND I'M STILL PRETTY HAPPY. >> Stephen: YOU ARE "PRETTY HAPPY." THIS IS YOUR BOOK. THERE YOU ARE. I LOVE THE PHOTO ON THE COVER OF THIS BOOK, BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPHER LIKE, "HOW DID YOU GET PAST THE ROTWIELLERS? YOU'RE NOT HERE TO STEAL MY HAT, ARE YOU?" WHAT DO YOU MEAN "PRETTY HAPPY?" WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE "PRETTY HAPPY?" >> BUT BEHIND IT I'M LIKE, YOU'RE KIND OF CUTE. >> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. WHAT DOES PRETTY HAPPY MEAN? WHY DO I WANT TO BE JUST PRETTY HAPPY? >> I THINK BECAUSE IF WE'RE CRAZY HAPPY ALL THE TIME THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING NOT RIGHT, RIGHT? LIKE, LIFE DOESN'T REALLY WORK THAT WAY. >> Stephen: SOMETIMES YOUR BOYS THROW UP ON YOU. >> RIGHT. RIGHT. >> Stephen: SO ARE YOU PRETTY HAPPY? IS THIS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE LIKE MOST OF THE TIME? >> I AM PRETTY HAPPY. BUT I'M A CREATIVE PERSON. SO I HAVE MY PEAKS AND VALLEYS. BUT I THINK THAT FOR ME, IT'S MORE ABOUT MOTIVATING PEOPLE, MOSTLY WOMEN, TO KIND OF LOOK AND CONNECT WITH THEMSELVES AND GET A GOOD PACELINE TO MOTIVATE THEMSELVES TO BE SORT OF HEALTHIER MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY. >> Stephen: YOU SAY YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> BUT, LIKE, TO BE REAL ABOUT IT. >> Stephen: BE REAL ABOUT IT. IT SAYS, "HEALTHY WAYS TO LOVE YOUR BODY." "LOVE" IS A STRONG WORD.

IN THE LAST 330 DAYS YOU WERE IN OFFICE, IF A ADVOCACY BECAME OPEN ON THE SUPREME COURT, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THE CONSTITUTION, SEE THE WORDS, "THE PRESIDENT SHALL," AND GO, "MAYBE LATER?" >> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, AS SOON AS SCALIA DIED, IT WAS ONE MINUTE AFTER HIS DEATH AND THE POLITICS STARTED. WE ARE SO DIVIDED DOWN THERE. AND MY APPROACH IS THIS-- I'VE SAILED THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO WITHHOLD THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTION -- >> WAIT, WE HAD AN ELECTION IN 2012. >> CAN I FINISH? >> Stephen: NO, PROBABLY NOT. GO AHEAD. >> ALL I'M SAYING IS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO, NUMBER ONE, VOTE FOR PRESIDENT, AND ALSO HAVE A SAY ON WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THE SUPREME COURT. IF I WERE PRESIDENT, JUST LIKE WHEN I'M GOVERNOR OF OHIO, YOU HAVE TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. AND YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THIS FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH LIKE WE HAVE IN WASHINGTON. LOOK, YOU CAN'T SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, STEPHEN, SOCIAL SECURITY. YOU CAN'T SOLVE THE BORDER. YOU CAN'T GET THE ECONOMY GROWING UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME SENSE OF UNITY. >> Stephen: SO IF YOU WERE PRESIDENT AND YOU WERE PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU WOULD SAY, "I WILL NOT APPOINT ANYONE." >> NO-- WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS DIVISION. BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SPEND MY TIME BUILDING BRIDGES SO WE CAN GROW THIS ECONOMY -- >> YOU SAID-- YOU SAID, IF I GOT THIS RIGHT, YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT APPOINT ANYONE UNLESS THEY COULD BE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED. >> I SAID ACCLAIMED-- STEPHEN, LOOK, THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SEND THE NOMINEE UP. >> Stephen: BUT NO ONE WILL BE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE THE OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS SAYS THAT'S THE PERSON WE WANT. >> Stephen: WE WON'T EVEN GET THAT WITH THE PRESIDENT. HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY GET. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> LOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTION-- LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTION NOW IN BEFORE WE KNOW IT THE BLINK OF AN EYE. AND THAT PERSON WHO IS ELECTED PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THE CONFIRMATION TO APPOINT WHOEVER THEY WANT, AND I THINK IT WILL BE A MORE ORDERLY, LESPOLITICAL FIGHT THAN WHAT WE SEE NOW. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T THINK THAT PRESENTLY EXISTS IN THE CONSTITUTION WHEN IT SAYS, "THE PRESIDENT SHALL APPOINT." >> NO, HE CAN'T APPOINT. HE CAN NOMINATE. AND THE SENATE CARRIES OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. >> Stephen: IT DOESN'T SAY THE PRESIDENT CAN DO IT IF IT'S NOT HIS LAST YEAR. IT SAYS, "THE PRESIDENT SHALL." >> ALL I'M SAYING IS I'M TIRED OF ALL THE FIGHTING. >> Stephen: I'M NOT FIGHTING WITH YOU. >> I'M TALKING ABOUT DOWN THERE. >> Stephen: IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THEY LIKE FIGHTING DOWN THERE. ( LAUGHTER ). >> WHAT I WANT TO DO IS HAVE RESPECT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AGAIN. I WANT THEM TO STOP DEMONIZING ONE ANOTHER, ANDIMENT TO AGAIN TO HAVE EVERYBODY REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER, IN MY OPINION, WITH CONSERVATIVE PROGRAMS TO RAISE THE COUNTRY. DIIT WHEN I WAS BUDGET CHAIRMAN, DIIT IN OHIO. ND  THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO AND I SEE THE FIGHTING OVER THE JUDGE ISN'T GOING TO WORK OUT. >> Stephen: GOOD LUCK, GOVERNOR.
