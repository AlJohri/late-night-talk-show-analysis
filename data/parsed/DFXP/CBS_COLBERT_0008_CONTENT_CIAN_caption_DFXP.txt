OH, OH, DO Y'ALL HEAR THAT, THAT FUNKALICIOUS UNDERSCORE MEANS ITS TIMES FOR MOMMA AND POPPAS TO UNMIND YOUR MIND, REFLED YOU ARE YOUR HEAD, GROOVIN BEHOOVIN. >> Jon: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. >> Stephen: BUT FIRST, ONE MORE THING.

INCREDIBLE, INCREDIBLE. INCREDIBLE. HOLD ON. HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M JUST GOING TO FIX MYSELF A CUP OF COFFEE HERE REAL QUICK. AND, HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM, TEPID. NOTHING BEATS PROP COFFEE. YOU SEE, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, I WAS UP YESTERDAY WATCHING THE SECOND REPUBLICAN DEBATE ON CNN. THE DEBATE STARTED LAST NIGHT ABOUT 8:00 P.M. AND IT ENDED-- DID IT END YET? >> WE'RE STILL IN THE FIRST BLOCK BELIEVE IT OR NOT. >> Stephen: OH, I BELIEVE IT. HMMMM, HMMMM, HMMMM, OH, YOU REQUEST REALLY TASTE THE RED. NOW FOLKS, I DON'T BLAME JAKE TAPPER FOR STRETCHING IT OUT. LAST NIGHT CNN GOT THEIR BEST RATINGS-OF-OF ALL TIME. AN IT'S ALL BECAUSE NO ONE PUMPS YOUR NUMBERS LIKE REAL ESTATE MOGUL AND MY DEAR FRIEND WHO I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING RIGHT THERE ON SEPTEMBER 22nd, DONALD TRUMP. AND, AND PEOPLE LOVE HIM AND IN THE SPIN ROOM AFTERWARDS DONALD HAD A COGENT ANALYSIS OF LAST NIGHT'S EPISODE OF AMERICAN NINJA DEBATER. >> WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED AFTER TONIGHT? >> WELL, I'VE LEARNED THAT I HAVE NO TROUBLE STANDING FOR THREE HOURS. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: IT IS IMPRESSIVE THAT HE COULD STAND THROUGH THE ENTIRE THING. I COULD BARELY SIT THROUGH IT. ONE REASON, ONE REASON IT WAS SO LONG WAS BECAUSE OF A RULE INSTITUTED BY CNN THAT EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T ASKED A DIRECT QUESTION, IF YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED BY ANY OTHER CANDIDATE, THEN YOU GOT TO SPEAK NEXT. AND IF AT THAT POINT YOU MENTIONED ANOTHER CANDIDATE, THAT OTHER CANDIDATE GOT TO SPEAK RIGHT AFTER YOU. SO A LOT OF THE DEBATE FELT LIKE THIS. >> MS. FIORINA I WANT TO START WITH YOU. >> I THINK MR. TRUMP IS A WONDERFUL ENTERTAINER. >> RAND PAUL SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THIS STAGE. >> SENATOR PAUL. >> GOVERNOR CRISTIE. >> CARLIE. >> SENATOR RUBIO. >> MR. TRUMP. >> I AGREE WITH WHAT CHRIS IS SAYING. >> I KNOW. >> JEB IS A FRIEND, DONALD TRUMP. >> ABRAHAM LINCOLN. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: THIS DEBATE WENT SO LONG THAT EVIDENTLY EVEN THE CANDIDATES MINDS STARTING WANDERING, FOR INSTANCE, AND THIS IS TRUE, AT 10:12 PEOPLE WHILE HE WAS ON STAGE DEBATING JEB BUSH JOINED VINE. (LAUGHTER) VINE, OF COURSE, POSTS VIDEOS OF ONLY SIX SECONDS OR SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN SCOTT WALKER WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK LAST NIGHT. OF COURSE, THE PERSON WHO SPOKED LONGEST WAS DONE ALD TRUMP. AND THE PERSON SPEAKERING SECOND LONGEST WAS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT DONALD-- DONALD TRUCH. >> I THINK THERE IS A SOPHOMORIC QUALITY THAT IS ENTERTAIN BEING MR. TRUMP BUT I AM WORRIED HIS VISCERAL RESPONSE TO ATTACK PEOPLE ON THEIR APPEARANCE, SHORT, TALL, FAT, UGLY, MY GOODNESS, THAT HAPPENED IN JUNIOR HIGH. ARE WE NOT WAY ABOVE THAT. >> MR. TRUMP? >> I NEVER ATTACKED HIM ON HIS LOOKS, AND BELIEVE ME, THERE'S PLENTY OF SUBJECT MATTER RIGHT THERE. >> Stephen: THAT'S A GOOD DIG BY A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE A MICROWAVE CIRCUS PEANUT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: LIKE A HONEY GLAZED TIGER TESTICLE. LIKE A CATHETER BAG FULL OF CANDY CORN. SEE YOU ON THE 22nd, SIR. BUT CLEARLY, CLEARLY LAST NIGHT THE BREAKOUT STAR WAS FORMER HEWLETT-PACKARD C.E.O. AND FUTURE STARFLEET CAPTAIN CARLEE FIORINA. OH YEAH. OH, SHE WAS TOUGH. I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE A ROMULAN MEETING HER IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE. YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE ROMULAN'S HAVE A NEUTRAL ZONE BETWEEN THEIR EMPIRE AND THE FEDERATION. LOOK IT UP. OKAY. THIS WOMAN LAST NIGHT BROUGHT IT AND CRUSHED IT AFTER AN ADMITTEDLY SLOW START. YOUR OPENING STATEMENT, MISS FIORINA (LAUGHTER) >> GOOD EVENING. >> Stephen: THANK YOU. NOW IN HER DEFENSE, EVERYTHING FROM HP DOES TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO WARM UP. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOT EVERYONE-- NOT EVERYONE CAME OUT LOOKING AS GOOD AS MISFIORINA. WE LEARNED SOME SHOCKING NEWS LAST NIGHT ABOUT ONE. CANDIDATES. >> I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT PROBLEMS AND WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ABOUT POLITICS IS HYPOCRISY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONE STANDARD FOR OTHERS AND NOT FOR THEMSELVES. THERE IS AT LEAST ONE PROBLEM PROMINENT EXAMPLE ON THE STAGE OF SOMEONE WHO SAYS THEY SMOKED POP IN HIGH SCHOOL. >> Stephen: YEAH TO BE A NARC, RAND. EXCUSE ME, UH, UH, EXCUSE ME MR. TAPPER ONE OF MY COMPETITORS IS A DOPER. OH, AND YOU FORGOT TO GET HIS HOME-- GIVE US HOMEWORK, SIR. COME ON! WELL, SO WHO BURNED DOWN, OFFICER BUZZ SHACKLER. >> DO YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY THAT PERSON. >> THE THING IS -- >> HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ME. >> YEAH, I WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR HIM. AND I JUST DID. >> GOVERNOR BUSH. >> SO 40 YEARS AGO I SMOKED MARIJUANA AND I ADMIT IT. >> Stephen: JEB BUSH SAY POT- HEAD. OH, THAT-- THAT EXPLAINS A LOT. HE ISN'T LOW ENERGY, HE'S BAKED. GOVERNOR KUSH, PUT DOWN THE SPLEEF. NOW I KNOW WHY THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE ON THAT STAGE THIS WASN'T A DEBATE, IT WAS AN INTERVENTION. WE LOVE YOU, JEB, AND WE JUST WANT TO HELP YOU. STICK AROUND FOR DAILY SHOW HOST TREVOR NOAH. >> THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT SPONSORED BY AT&T, MORE ILIZING YOUR WORLD (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME BACK! I'M SO HAPPY ABOUT POPE FRANCIS'S UPCOMING VISIT TO NEW YORK CITY ON SEPTEMBER 24th. AS A CATHOLIC THAT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS COMING EARLY. AN WHO KNOWS, WHILE HE IS HERE, HE COULD MAKE IT OFFICIAL. HE HAS THAT POWER. EVERYONE IS EXPECTED ABOUT THIS, PEOPLE MAGAZINE RECENTLY NAMED HIM SEXIEST POPE ALIVE. BUT NO ONE IS MORE EXCITED THAN NEW YORKERS. MORE THAN 93,000 PEOPLE ENTERED THE LOTTERY TO SEE HIM IN CENTRAL PARK AND MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. HIS HOLINESS WILL ADDRESS A CROWD OF OVER 19,000 ADORING CATHOLICS AND ONE GUY WHO GOT TO THE RANGERS GAME REALLY EARLY. AND THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE MADISON SQUARE GARDEN MASS IS WELL UNDER WAY. CAMERAS WERE ROLLING AS NEW YORK'S TIM KNEE-- TIMOTHY CARDINAL DOLAN UNVEILED THE POPE'S OFFICIAL CHAIR. >> LET'S GET REALLY TO HUUUUMBLLLLEEE. Y'ALL READY TO SIT? THERE IT IS. THERE IS THE CHAIR IN ALL ITS DOLLAREE READY TO RECEIVE THE HOLLY SEE'S HOLY SEAT. BY THE WAY I BELIEVE THEY LEFT THE TIME WARNER SIGN THERE TO REMIND US THAT THERE IS STILL EVIL IN THE WORLD. (LAUGHTER) AND I KNOW--  (APPLAUSE) AND I KNOW THE POPE'S GOING TO LOVE IT AS MUCH AS I DO BECAUSE ACCORDING TO CARDINAL DOLAN IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE ASKED FOR. >> YOU WANTED SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE. HE WANTED SOMETHING WOODEN. HE DIDN'T WANT ANY DESIGNS. >> Stephen: YES, IT'S PERFECT FOR THE MAN THEY CALL THE PEOPLE'S POPE, A SIMPLE WOODEN CHAIR. THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IT WOULD HAVE GONE WITH THE WHITE UPHOLSTERY. HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT HE WEARS, HE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE A FLOATING HEAD. NOW REGARDING THE CHAIR, CARDINAL DOLAN WENT ON TO EXPLAIN CHAIR. >> A CHAIR IS VERY IMPORTANT IN CATHOLIC IMAGINATION. A CHAIR REPRESENTS UNITY AND A CHAIR REPRESENTS TEACHING AUTHORITY. THE MAN WHO OCCUPIES THE CHAIR OF ST. PETER, ALL RIGHT, IS OUR HOLY FATHER THE POPE, THE BISHOP OF ROME. SO WHEREVER HE GOES YOU WANT TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT CHAIR. >> Stephen: YES. THERE'S NOT MUCH IN CATHOLICISM MORE IMPORTANT THAN A CHAIR. WELL, TECHNICALLY ALL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE FURNITURE. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE JESUS WAS BORN IN A MANAGER. I WAS BORN IN A MANAGER, SEE, NO ONE GETS THE MORE COMFORTABLE SEAT THAN THE SON OF GOD. I RUN THIS UNIVERSITY, SEE, MWA, THAT'S MY IMPRESSION OF JESUS. IT COULD BE, YOU DON'T KNOW. THAT COULD BE EXACTLY WHAT HE SOUNDS LIKE. THERE ARE NO KNOWN RECORDINGS OF HIM OTHER THAN THE DEAD SEA 8 TRACK TAPES AND THE QUALITY IS TERRIBLE. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS CHAIR DIDN'T COME FROM ONE OF THOSE NAME BRAND LUXURY POPECHAIR FACTORIES. IT WAS HANDMADE BY A GROUP OF MIGRANT DAY LABOURERS WHO I ASSUMED POPE PICKED UP OUTSIDE OF ROME DEPOT. AND CARDINAL DOLAN-- AND CARDINAL DOLAN, CARDINAL DOLAN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. EVERYWHERE THE POPE GOES YOU WANT TO HAVE A SPECIAL CHAIR FOR HIM. ANMORE THAN ANYTHING I WANT HIM TO COME ON MY SHOW. ALL RIGHT. (APPLAUSE) SO I HAVE ALSO-- I HAVE ALSO MADE A SPECIAL CHAIR JUST FOR THE POPE. IT'S SO HUMBLE. IT'S GOING TO MAKE THAT OTHER CHAIR LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE HIGH-TECH ROBOT JAPANESE TOILETS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU THE LATE SHOW POPECHAIR. (APPLAUSE) YOU WANT HUMBLE? YOU WANT HUMBLE? THAT IS HUMBLE. AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S A LOWLY FOLDING CHAIR SPRAY-PAINTED WITH THE WORD "POPE" ON IT. THIS WILL BE HERE FOR YOU, YOUR HOLINESS. IF ARE YOU IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, MAYBE DOWN AT THE M & M STORE AND YOU DECIDE TO SWING BY, I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL HAVE A PLACE HERE TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. AND IF YOU COME WHEN YOU ARE IN THE CITY NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT, YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO MEET KERRY WASHINGTON, SHE'S COOL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE NEW HOST OF THE DAILY SHOW TREVOR NOAH. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY! HE IS A SOUTH AFRICAN COMEDIAN WHO WILL TAKE OVER HOST OF COMEDY CENTRAL'S "THE DAILY SHOW" ON SEPTEMBER 28th. PLEASE WELCOME TREVOR NOAH. (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. >> I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE. >> Stephen: ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: IF YOU WANT TO BURST INTO SONG, GO RIGHT AHEAD. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, MAN. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >> I MEAN STEPPING INTO THE SEAT OF A LEGEND OF TALK SHOWS. THAT'S CRAZY! WHO ON EARTH WOULD EVER WANT TO DO THAT? THAT'S A BUZZ SAW. GET OUT OF THERE. >> EVERY DAY I GO WHAT HAVE I DONE. WHAT HAVE I DONE, YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T LIVE UP TO JON STEWART, IT'S INSANE. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK JON STEWART WOULD DISAGREE. BECAUSE JON STEWART THOUGHT YOU WERE THE RIGHT GUY FOR THE JOB. DID YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT WHAT THE JOB TAKES OVER AT THE DAILY SHOW. HAS HE GIVEN YOU ADVICE. >> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT JON, JON IS LIKE A JEWISH YODA, THAT IS WHAT HE IS LIKE. I SAY WHAT IS THE DAILY SHOW, HE SAYS THE DAILY SHOW IS WHAT THE DAILY SHOW SHOULD BE FOR YOU TO BE THE BEST SHOW YOU CAN MAKE. (LAUGHTER) >> AND THEN I DON'T WANT TO SEEM STUPID SO I GO YEA, YEAH AND I WALK AWAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT. >> Stephen: THAT IS SOME -- >> THE MAIN THING JON SAID TO ME IS TRUST YOUR DISCOMFORT. IF YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, THAT IS THE WAY YOU SHOULD BE GOING. >> Stephen: OH, SO-- REALLY? >> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. >> Stephen: IF YOU THINK THAT MAYBE THIS JOKE IS A LITTLE BIT TOO EDGY, GO AHEAD AND GO THAT WAY. >> THAT IS THE WAY TO GO. >> Stephen: AS IF YOU ARE APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION AN ARE YOU GOING VERY FAST AND THE LIGHT GOES FROM GREEN TO YELLOW, GUN IT TO GET UNDER THE LIGHT BEFORE IT TURNS RED. >> NO. >> Stephen: THAT WOULD BE MY ADVICE TO YOU. >> DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN WATCHING THE SHOW. THAT IS HERBL ADVICE. >> Stephen: I DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO WATCH THE SHOW AT ALL. >> NO, YEAH, HE JUST SAID GO INTO IT. THAT IS REALLY WHAT THE DAILY SHOW IS ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT COMEDY IS ABOUT, YOU DO THAT ALL THE TIME. >> Stephen: OH, NO. >> YOU DO THAT ALL THE TIME, YOU DO. >> Stephen: YOU ARE FROM SOUTH AFRICA, YOU DID A SHOW CALLED TONIGHT WITH TREVOR NOAH IN SOUTH AFRICA. >> YES. >> Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT SHOW LIKE, WAS IT LIKE A DAILY SHOW. >> YES, IT WAS AT NIGHT, NOT DAILY WHICH IS A MUST CONCEPTION. IT WAS WITH ME. >> Stephen: DID YOU DO IT EVERY DAY. >> NO BE, ONE NIGHT, I CALLED IT ONE NIGHT, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT IT WAS ONE NIGHT. >> Stephen: ONE NIGHT A WEEK. >> ONE NIGHT A WEEK. >> Stephen: YOU WILL HAVE TO STEP IT UP, MY MAN. >> YEAH. AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO PLAY ANY CLIPS AND STUFF SO WHEN I CAME TO AMERICA, BECAUSE WE HAD TO DESCRIBE ALL THE PICTURES. SO I GO HERE IS THE JOKE, NOW IMAGINE A PICTURE OF THIS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA. THERE IS A MAN NAMED BARACK OBAMA HE IS PRESIDENT AND HE IS A BLACK MAN, THIS IS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. >> Stephen: HERE HE IS, RIGHT NOW. >> WE HAD NO RIGHTS. WE ARE HAD NO RIGHTS TO ANY OF THE PICTURES SO WE COULDN'T PUT ANYTHING UP, WE COULDN'T PLAY ANY VIDEOS. >> Stephen: BARACK OBAMA. >> THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT I DID. >> Stephen: SERIOUSLY. >> YEAH, SO WE WEREN'T AS FREE. IT WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT RULES. >> WHAT ABOUT IN SOUTH AFRICA WHEN YOU WERE WORKING THERE. HOW OLD ARE YOU HOW? >> I'M 31 NOW. >> Stephen: ME TOO, VERY CLOSE TO THAT. AND HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING AS A COMIC. >> I'VE BEEN WORKING AS A COMIC FOR 10, GOING ON 11 YEARS. >> Stephen: SO 10 OR 11 YEARS AGO WAS THERE A TRADITION OF IS A TIRE IN SOUTH AFRICA. COULD YOU MAKE FUN OF THE GOVERNMENT, COULD YOU CRITICIZE THE PEOPLE IN POWER AND GET AWAY WITH IT. >> YEAH, YOU COULD, AROUND 10, 11 YEARS AGO YOU COULD. 1990 IS WHEN IT TIPPED OVER. THAT IS WHEN IT WENT FROM JAIL, TO OKAY THAT IS A JOKE. THAT WAS LIKE, THAT'S WHEN IT SHALL DID --. >> THAT IS A BIG TIP. >> YEAH. MOST PEOPLE WOULD GO YOU WOULD GET ARRESTED FOR THAT. THERE WERE GREAT COMEDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA DOING THAT. AND IF YOU MADE THE JOKES ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OR WHAT WAS HAPPENING, YOU WOULD GET ARRESTED. >> Stephen: THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY, WE HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT HERE. >> I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. >> Stephen: WELL, IS THE SHOW GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS OR AMERICAN SOCIETY OR AS SOMEBODY WHO IS FROM OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD/IT GOING TO BE SORT OF A GLOBAL SHOW. >> EVERYONE ASKING ME THAT. THEY GO AS AN OUTSIDER, IS THE SHOW GOING TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE-- YEAH, BUT I'M AN OUTSIDER AND I HAVE COME FROM A PLACE. BUT I'M NOT AN OUTSIDER. I LIVE HERE. I LIVE IN NEW YORK, YOU KNOW, SO I SUFFER THE SAME THINGS THAT PEOPLE SUFFER THROUGH HERE. >> Stephen: OH, ALL RIGHT. >> I PAY TAXES AND I WOULD LIKE THE MONEY TO BE USED IN A GOOD MANNER. AND SO IF I'M IN A POTHOLE, DRIVING THROUGH NEW YORK AND I GO E I'M THE GOING OH AS AN OUTSIDER THAT AFFECTED ME-- BUT. >> Stephen: BUT YOU GAVE THAT POTHOLE A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. >> THAT'S THE KEY. NOT AS BAD AS THE POTHOLES IN ZAMBIA BUT A POTHOLE NONETHELESS. >> Stephen: ARE YOU A CITIZEN, CAN YOU VOTE. >> NO, I CANNOT, WHICH IS MAKING IT SOME OF MORE FUN FOR ME. IT IS LIKE WATCHING SPORTS AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE A TEAM, YOU CAN JUST ENJOY IT. >> Stephen: RIGHT. >> PEOPLE GET SO STRESSED, OH, PASS THE BALL, PASS THE BALL, NO, HOLD ON TO THE BALL IF YOU WANT. I DON'T CARE. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU ENDED UP VOTING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL LOOK, THAT WOULD MAKE YOU UNLIKE MOST AMERICANS ANYWAY. >> YEAH, YOU GUYS, YOU SHOULD VOTE, YOU REALLY SHOULD. YOU SHOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO NOT VOTE THAT IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> I THINK SO EVEN IF YOU GO IN AND YOU SAY I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING. LIKE DEMOCRACY IS SUCH A POWERFUL-- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE IT, YOU DON'T APPRECIATE IT. BUT WHEN YOU GO THIS THING IS SO, EVEN IF YOU GO IN AND GO I DON'T VOTE FOR YOU, I WILL VOTE FOR THESE NUTS, VOTE FOR THE THING, BUT JUST SHOW THAT YOU ARE THERE, JUST MAKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. DON'T LET IT GO. >> Stephen: DID YOU WATCH THE REPUBLICAN DEBATE LAST NIGHT. >> UNFORTUNATELY, YES. >> Stephen: YOU DID. >> YEAH. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOMENTS OF REGRET, STEPHEN. IT WAS THREE HOURS, THREE HOURS 10 MINUTES, 15 MINUTES. >> YEAH, YEAH. >> AND NO ONE SAID ANYTHING. ASK ME A QUESTION, I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT THEY DID. ASK ME ANYTHING, ABOUT POLICY, ANYTHING. >> Stephen: POLICY, OKAY.

IT WAS FUN. >> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM WE HAVE HERE, COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF AMERICA'S POLITICAL SYSTEM. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU. >> YES, IT IS FANTASTIC. THIS IS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. IT IS FREE SPEECH, YOU GET PEOPLE OUT THERE. THERE CAN BE MORE STRUCTURE BUT IT IS A WONDERFUL THING THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRACY IS. IT IS FUNNY, PEOPLE GO THAT GUY, BUT SOMEONE VOTED FOR HIM. I ALWAYS SAY PEOPLE ACT LIKE THESE PEOPLE VOTE THEMSELVES IN. WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY CRAZY LIKE SOMEBODY VOTED FOR THEM. THAT IS WHAT DEMOCRACY IS. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL AND UGLY THING AT THE SAME TIME, SO ENJOY IT. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> ENJOY DONE ALL TRUMP OR -- >> OR ENJOY BARACK OBAMA. TREVOR, GOOD LUCK, MAN, YOU'RE GOING TO CRUSH IT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. >> Stephen: TREVOR NOAH TAKES OVER AS HOST OF THE "THE DAILY SHOW" ON COMEDY CENTRAL SEPTEMBER 28th.

THAT MEANS I GET A LOT OF PERKS LIKE WHEN TIM COOK WAS ON THIS WEEK I GOT A NEW APPLE WATCH. TIME. THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT EVENTUALLY. BUT LATELY, FOLKS, I REALIZE WITH EVEN WITH ALL THE TRAININGS OF FAME, THERE IS MORE TO LIFE. THERE IS LIFESTYLE. >> GWYNETH PALTROW HAS BUILT A LIFESTYLE EMPIRE WITH HER GOOP BRAND, ELLEN DEGENERES IS LAUNCHING ED FEATURING A COLLECTION OF HOME, FASHION AND OF COURSE PETED ITEMS. >> BLAKE LIVELY IS LAUNCHING HER OWN LIFESTYLE BRAND. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE BRAND WILL BE ABOUT LIVING A ONE OF A KIND CURE RATED LIFE AND HOW TO ACHIEVE THAT. >> Stephen: YES, IT'S NOW POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE THE EXACT SAME ONE OF A KIND CURE RATED LIFESTYLE BY BUYING IT FROM A CELEB RATED. -- CELEBRITY. FOR INSTANCE,-- ENDORSING PACKING CRATE NAME FROM RECLAIMED LOCAL WOOD SEALED WITH NATURAL TUNG OIL, EACH CRATE IS IMBUED WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE CHARACTER AND COSTS $95. YES, EACH CRATE HAS A UNIQUE CHARACTER. IN FACT, I NAMED MINE CHARLIE BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF THIS GUY CHARLIE WHO STOLE $95 BUCKS FROM ME. OR PERHAPS REESE WITHERSPOON'S LIFE SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRETEND TO HAVE. OVER AT REESE'S "DRAPER JAMES" YOU CAN GET THIS $85 SET OF, NOT FIVE, NOT SIX, BUT FOUR LINEN NAPKINS WITH SOUTHERN SAYINGS LIKE DON'T MIND IF I DO. AND TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD. IT IS TRADITIONAL IN THE SOUTH TO TELL YOUR HOST SOMETHING GOOD. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU SPEND $85 ON FOUR NAPKINS. BLESS YOUR HEART. BUT OF COURSE, THE URWOMB OF ALL LIFESTYLE BRANDS IS GWYNETH'S GOOP WHICH OVERS A 28 MUD BAR. IT IS GREAT IF YOU TAKE A SHOWER TO GET DIRTIER. WITH ALL OF THESE LIFESTYLE BRANDS YOU FINALLY GET TO KNOW YOUR FAVORITE CELL EBBS FROM THE COMFORT OF THEIR OWN HOME PAGES. >> I HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT I WANTED ANSWERED, BOTH PHILOSOPHICALLY AND, YOU KNOW, HEALTH WELLNESS QUESTIONS, TRAVEL QUESTIONS, RESTAURANTS, AND I YOU JUST STARTED TO ASK QUESTIONS. >> YOU HAVE A CA YEAR-- CAREER AND YOU THINK THIS IS MY-- AND THIS IS AN ART. BUT REALLY THIS IS DAY AND AGE, EACH PERSON IS THEIR OWN BRAND. >> Stephen: YES, YOU MIGHT THINK YOU ARE A PERSON, BUT ARE YOU REALLY A BRAND. WHEN TWO BRANDS LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH, THEY SHARE A SPECIAL KIND OF HUG AND THEY BECOME PARENT COMPANIES. BUT FOLKS, THERE IS ONE VERY POPULAR CELEBRITY WHOSE NOTABLY MISSING FROM THIS LINE-UP OF INTERNET TASTEMAKERS. ALAN RICKMAN. ALSO ME.

DO FORCIBLY OR ACTIVELY TO IMPROVE THAT? >> UNITED NATIONS IS MOBILIZING ALL THE AGENCIES AND ALL THE MEMBER STATES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BRING LIFE-SAVING-- DAILY FOOD, WATER AND EDUCATION. ALL THIS WHAT WE ARE DOING. >> Stephen: THERE ARE 193 COUNTRIES MEETING AT THE U.N.. AND DO WE NEED ALL OF THEM? ARE THERE SOME OF THOSE COUNTRIES YOU GO LIKE, WE HAVE BELGIUM AND HOLLAND. CAN'T WE JUST LET ONE OF THEM GO? BECAUSE EVERY COUNTRY THINKS THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY, RIGHT. >> YES, OF COURSE. >> Stephen: OKAY. AS THE U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL YOU'RE ALSO FROM SOUTH KOREA, SOUTH KOREA IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY TO YOU? >> OF COURSE I LOVE MY COUNTRY. IN 1950 WE WERE ATTACKED BY AGGRESSION. IT WAS THE UNITED NATIONS WHO CAME TO SAVE MY COUNTRY, KOREA. >> Stephen: WERE YOU A REFUGEE AS A CHILD? >> YES. WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD, THEN KOREAN WAR BROKE OUT AND I HAD TO FLEE MY HOMETOWN. WHATEVER I SAW, LOOKING BACK, WAS THAT ONLY VILLAGE, WE HAD TO FLEE FROM MOUNTAINSIDE. IT WAS COMPLETELY LEFT, FOOD, WATER, I WAS CRYING OUT OF POVERTY. AT THAT TIME, UNITED NATIONS CAME. THEY PROVIDE FOOD, CLOTHES TO US, TO ME, UNITED NATIONS WAS A BEACON OF HOPE. >> Stephen: NOW YOU ARE A DIPLOMAT. AND YOU HAVE TO BE DIPLOMATIC TO EVERYONE.

BY THE TIME-- HE HAS BROUGHT HIS OWN INTERPRETER. HE COULDN'T CONTINUE. HE SAID THAT I CANNOT GO LIKE THIS, CAN ANYBODY HELP ME. HE COLLAPSED. >> HE SPOKE UNTIL HIS INTERPRETER COLLAPSED. >> YES, THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: WOW. >> THAT'S ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU. >> THAT IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN TELL ME?
