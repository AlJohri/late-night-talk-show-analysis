STEPHEN COLBERT! (  BAND PLAYING INTRO MUSIC  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )  Captioning sponsored by CBS
Stephen: HEY! HEY! WHOA SPHWHVME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU, SO MUCH. THANK YOU, OUT THERE. THANK YOU DOWN THERE. THANK YOU OVER THERE.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN.
Stephen: THANK YOU. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK SO MUCH. PLEASE, THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY?
WOW! THERE'S ENORMOUS-- THERE'S ENORMOUS EXCITEMENT IN THE ROOM. THIS ROOM IS LIKE A LIT FIRECRACKER TONIGHT, MY FRIENDS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YOU CAN FEEL IT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY ELECTRIC.
Jon: WHOA! WHOA!
Stephen: IT'S LIKE A FIRECRACKER AND IT'S ELECTRIC. IT'S LIKE AN ELECTRIC FIRE CRACKER, WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE IS LEGAL IN NEW YORK STATE. I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS-- ARE YOU EXCITED? IT'S A HUGE NIGHT FOR POLITICS TONIGHT. DO YOU GUYS REALIZE WHAT'S GOING ON? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT WANT 2016 ELECTION FOR MONTHS NOW, AND I AM EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT TONIGHT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS. IT'S THE IOWA CAUCUS. WE HAVE REACHED THE HAPPY ENDING OF AMERICA'S LONG AND FRUSTRATING CAUCUS TEASE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon: WHOA, WHOA!
Stephen: AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? JUDGES, AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? TONIGHT WE WILL FINALLY FIND OUT WHO HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF IOWA. NOW, WE TAPED THE SHOW-- WE TAPED THIS SHOW AROUND 5:30, SO IF ANYBODY HERE KNOWS WHO WON, DON'T TELL ME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. IT'S ALSO 5:30 FOR YOU. AND BECAUSE IOWA VOTES FIRST, THE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME THERE. AND AS THEY SAY, TIME IS MONEY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS MONEY? MONEY. MORE THAN $70 MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT ON CAMPAIGN ADS IN IOWA, ALONE, INCLUDING $15 MILLION BY JEB BUSH'S SUPERPAC. AND YET, JEB'S STILL POLLING BELOW 4%. AND SOME PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED, BUT IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT ADS CAN'T HELP THAT MUCH. BECAUSE IF THEY DID, THE 2016 CAUCUS WOULD BE WON BY FLO, THE PROGRESSIVE LADY. ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SHE COULD SOLVE OUR BUDGET PROBLEMS WITH THAT GUN, WITH THE LITTLE GUN, WHERE THEY SHOOT AT THINGS. WE KNOW ONE THING: WHOEVER WINS TONIGHT PROBABLY DID ONE THING IT BY SUCK UP TO BIG CORN. NATURER'S GOLD. THE YELLOW DRAGON. REDENBACHER'S BUTTERY MISTRESS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE THE BIG ISSUE IN IOWA IS ALWAYS CORN SUBSIDIES. THAT'S WHY IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, IOWA HAS RECEIVED NEARLY $25 BILLION IN FARM SUBSIDIES. THAT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MONEY WASHINGTON SPENDS FUNDING THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE CORN-SHAPED CORN ON THE COB HOLDER. THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL SIGN FOR LITTLE CORN HOLDERS, LIKE THAT. AND WHILE I MAY NOT KNOW WHO WON, I'M CELEBRATING THE IOWA SPIRIT TONIGHT BY EATING FOODS ONLY MADE WITH HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD.
Stephen: SO ALL FOODS. WE'RE ALSO CELEBRATING WITH A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FIRST, I'LL SIT DOWN WITH ACTORS COURTNEY B. VANCE AND JOHN TRAVOLTA. TWO! TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR NEW SERIES, "THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON: AMERICAN CRIME STORY." IT'S JUST LIKE "MAKING A MURDERER," EXCEPT WE KNOW HE DID IT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) PRETTY SURE.
Jon: WHOA!
PRETTY SURE. I KNOW THAT'S A SCANDALOUS THING TO SAY AT THIS POINT. THEN I'LL TALK WITH AUTHOR AND HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PROFESSOR AMY CUDDY. SHE'S AN EXPERT ON BODY LANGUAGE SO I WILL CONDUCT THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW IN MIME. ( APPLAUSE ) AND WE'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE BY SINGER-SONGWRITER JOHN MORELAND. ( BAND PLAYING ) HEY! ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYONE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY'RE ABOUT TO CONTINUE TO PLAY SOME BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING. PARAMOUNT PICTURES HAS ANNOUNCED A FILM ADAPTATION OF "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE." I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM CHURN BUTTER IN 3D!!!
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES FROM PEEP JOHN TRAVOLTA AND COURTNEY B. VANCE. AUTHOR AMY CUDDY. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY JOHN MORELAND. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WHOA! THANK YOU, JON. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
Jon: YEAH.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! ARE.
Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, THANKS FOR ALL THE ENERGY YOU GIVE US UP HERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY TO ME, THEY SAY, "STEVE." I SAY, "STEPHEN, BUT THANK YOU." THEY SAY, "STEPHEN, HOW DO YOU DO YOUR SHOW. EVERY DAY, ONE HOUR A DAY? ( LAUGHTER ) THE GRIND MUST BE INHUMAN." I ALWAYS SAY THANK YOU FOR NOTICING BUT ACTUALLY DOING THE SHOW IS PRETTY EASY." BECAUSE I WORK FOR CBS. WHICH MEANS I HAVE ACCESS TO AN ARCHIVE OF CBS ENTERTAINMENT GOING BACK ALMOST 80 YEARS, TV, TO RADIO, TO WHERE CBS GOT ITS START, NAUGHTY LIMERICKS BY TELEGRAM. LITTLE-KNOWN SECRET, EDWARD R. MURROW WAS THE ORIGINAL MAN FROM NANTUCKET. AND WHENEVER WE WANT, WE CAN JUST DIP INTO THAT ARCHIVE FOR SOME FREE CONTENT. IT'S TIME FOR OUR VERY FIRST TRIP INTO THE CBS VAULT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LIKE MANY PEOPLE MY AGE-- WE'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, AND PEOPLE ARE ALREADY HUGE FANS OF THE CBS VAULT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT. IT'S BLOWING UP. CBS VAULT IS BLOWING UP. YOU KNOW, FOLKS, LIKE MANY PEOPLE MY AGE, I GREW UP WATCHING "THE TWILIGHT ZONE," HOSTED BY THE GREAT ROD SERLING, THE SHOW THAT INTRODUCED A WHOLE GENERATION TO SCIENCE FICTION, AND CHAIN SMOKING. YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON "THE TWILIGHT ZONE" FOR SURPRISING TWIST ENDINGS THAT YOU NEVER SAW COMING, LIKE THE EPISODE WHERE A WOMAN UNDERGOES RADICAL PLASTIC SURGERY IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOOK NORMAL, AND THEN THE AUDIENCE DISCOVERS THAT IN HER SOCIETY, NORMAL IS A RACE OF PIG-FACED CREATURES. IT REALLY-- IT REALLY MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE PEOPLE WOULD TASTE LIKE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND BECAUSE IT WAS A CBS SHOW, I HAVE ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE "TWILIGHT ZONE" CATEGORY, INCLUDING UNRELEASED EPISODES WE'VE NEVER SEEN. AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO SHOW THEM IN THEIR ENTIRETY, IT'S NOT THE 1960s ANYMORE. AND EVERYONE HAS SHORTER ATTENTION SPANS. DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER WHAT SHOW I'M TALKING ABOUT? PLEASE, JUST PUT DOWN YOUR PHONE FOR JUST A SECOND. PLUS THE TWIST ENDINGS ARE REALLY THE BEST PART. THEY'RE LIKE THE CREAM FILLING, WHICH LATER TURNS OUT TO BE MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND SO TONIGHT, WE BRING YOU JUST THE BEST PARTS AS WE OPEN THE CBS VAULT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SUBMITTED FOR YOUR APPROVAL, TALES OF EXPECTATIONS SHATTERED, ASSUMPTIONS OBLITERATED, PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS STUFFED INTO A BAG OF DOUBTS AND TOSSED IN A LAKE OF HUNCHES, ALL WITHOUT THE BORING 30-MINUTE SET-UPS. FIRST ON TONIGHT'S MANIFEST OF THE UNKNOWN, EVEN IN OUR MODERN AGE, A DOG CAN BE MAN'S BEST FRIEND. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE U.R.L. FOR pets.com IS REDIRECTED TO "THE TWILIGHT ZONE"?
NO! NO! NO! AAAHH.
WAKE UP! WAKE UP, FATHER!
OH! OF OH, THANK GOD! IT WAS JUST A DREAM. I DIDN'T ACTUALLY GO BACK IN TIME AND SAVE OUR BELOVED DOG MUFFINS FROM BEING HIT BY A CAR.
BUT, OF COURSE, YOU DID, FATHER. AND NOW MUFFINS IS OUR LEADER. HAIL MUFFIN.
NO! NO! BAD DOG! BAD DOG! BAD DOG! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT ( BLEEP ) IS MESSED UP. ( LAUGHTER ) A PARKING TICKET SUBMITTED FOR YOUR VALIDATION. A WOMAN ALONE AT THE END OF THE WORLD. THE ONLY PERSON LEFT ALIVE. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT WHY. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS SHE LOVES SOUP. HER FAVORITE FLAVOR: CREAM OF "TWILIGHT ZONE."
EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS DEAD. AT LAST I HAVE ALL OF EARTH'S CANNED SOUP TO MYSELF. CAN'T WAIT TO EAT ALL OF IT AT A LEISURELY PACE. ALL I NEED IS MY CAN OPENER. YES! THERE IT IS! NOW, JUST TO VERIFY THAT IT WORKS. PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL CAN OPENER. AND NOW, TO EEPT THE SOUP WITH MY TRUSTY... FORK? BUT-- FORK. THEY'RE ALL FORKS. NO! NO! NO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: SHE'S GOING TO TOTALLY KILL HERSELF. WITH A FORK. E-MAILED IN A DRUNKEN RAGE WITHOUT PROOFREADING: A VENTRILOQUIST AND HIS PARTNER ABOUT TO MAKE THEIR BIG DEBUT. PRICE OF ADMISSION? $1.90, "TWILIGHT ZONE."
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME, OFFICER. SURE, I KILLED THE NIGHTCLUB OWNER. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO. IT WAS KNUCKLES. HE MADE ME DO IT. GO ON, KNUCKLES. TELL THE NICE MAN THAT YOU'RE THE REAL BRAINS BEHIND THE OPERATION. COME OBUCKLES. TELL HIM.
HOLD ON. THERE'S NO PULSE. YOU'VE KILLED HIM. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF THE NIGHTCLUB OWNER, AND KNUCKLES THE DUMMY.
OH! OH, NO! I DIDN'T DO IT! NO, NO, NO! BELIEVE ME. IT WAS ALL KNUCKLES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THAT'S A TRUE STORY. THAT HAPPENED TO A FRIEND OF MINE. HE KNEW THE DUMMY'S COUSIN. SO ENDS ANOTHER ROLLER-COASTER RIDE THROUGH THE LONG DROP OF MADNESS AND ROUND THE LOOP-DE-LOOP OF THE INEXPLICABLE, ONLY TO DISCOVER YOU SPENT $200 ON A FAST PASS BUT WERE TOO SHORT TO RIDE. SO YOU HEAD OUT TO YOUR CAR, WHICH YOU CAN'T FIND, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PRETTY SURE YOU PARKED ON LEVEL "B," PARKING SPACE "THE TWILIGHT ZONE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JOHN TRAVOLTA AND COURTNEY B. VANCE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUESTS TONIGHT STAR AS TWO OF THE DREAM TEAM LAWYERS WHO REPRESENTED O.J. IN "THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON." PLEASE WELCOME JOHN TRAVOLTA AND COURTNEY B. VANCE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: NOT EVERY GUEST ON THIS SHOW-- NOT EVERY GUEST ON THE SHOW GETS A STANDING OVATION. THAT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY. YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?
WE DO, NOW.
Stephen: JON GETS TO KNOW PEOPLE VERY FAST WITH HIS MUSIC. OKAY, "THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON." WE ALL KNOW THE STORY BUT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO NOW. YOU GUYS WERE BOTH ACTORS IN LOS ANGELES 20 YEARS AGO. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT YEAR, WHAT IT WAS LIKE OUT THERE? BECAUSE THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS CAPTIVATED. DID IT FEEL EVEN MORE INTENSE OUT THERE?
I-- YOU KNOW, I JUST REMEMBER WHERE I WAS. I KNOW-- I WAS-- I WAS SHOOTING "PANTHER" IN SACRAMENTO. AND WE WERE-- WE WERE IN A LOBBY OF A HOTEL, AND THE N.B.A. FINALS WERE ON. AND --
DURING THE BRONCO CHASE.
DURING THE BRONCO CHASE. AND THEY PREEMPTED IT. AND WAS LIKE, WHAT? WHAT IS THIS? THE N.B.A. FINALS? COME ON NOW." AND ALL OF A SUDDEN-- ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT BECAME-- IT WAS HUGE. THIS IS MY GUY, O.J. SIMPSON. I WAS SUCH A HUGE FAN, WHICH IS WHY WHY I DIDN'T REALLY FOLLOW IT. I WAS SO SHOCKED.
Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVED HIM.
ABSOLUTELY.
DON'T ACT LIKE YOU DIDN'T LOVE JUICE.
Stephen: EVERYBODY LOVES THE JUICE.
MY DAD WAS A FOOTBALL COACH AND A FOOTBALL PLAYER, AND HE WAS GLUED TO THE TV OVER THIS WHOLE THING. I WAS BASKING IN THE "PULP FICTION" GLORY AT THE MOMENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: OH, THAT'S RIGHT. THIS CAME OUT-- THE SAME TIME THAT CAME OUT WAS WHEN THE BRONCO CHASE--
WE HAD JUST WON BEST PICTURE AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL, AND THERE WAS DIALITY, OR DICHOTOMY OF FEELING THIS AMERICAN TRAGEDY AT THE SAME TIME CELEBRATING A COMEBACK. IT WAS A VERY MIXED THING FOR ME. BUT MY DAD WAS KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH REALITY, SO I FOLLOWED IT PRETTY WELL THROUGH HIM.
Stephen: I WAS DRIVING DOWN TO A WEDDING WITH SOME FRIENDS DOWN IN MARYLAND. THE PARTY IT'S REHEARSAL DINNER PARTY HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE WHEN I GOT THERE AND NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WALKED IN AND WAS A COMPLETE JERK. I SAID, "YOU HAVE TO TURN THE TV ON." YEAH, THE BRIDE WAS NOT HAPPY WITH ME.
SO YOU PREEMPTED A WEDDING.
Stephen: I PREEMPTED A WEDDING, EXACTLY. THESE ARE THE TWO CHARACTERS YOU PLAY, WHO ARE REAL PEOPLE, OKAY. HERE IS, JOHN, THIS IS YOU AND YOUR EYEBROWS PLAIL ROBERT SHAPIRO, LEAD COUNSEL FOR O.J. SIMPSON. AND, COURTNEY, HERE YOU ARE AS THE GREAT JOHNNIE COCHRAN, RIGHT THERE.  ( APPLAUSE ) IS THERE A PARTICULAR PRESSURE PLAYING A REAL PERSON?
WELL, I DON'T MIND THAT BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU SOME SORT OF A BLUEPRINT TO WORK FROM. AND I-- I KIND OF ENJOY THAT.
Stephen: WERE THERE PARTICULAR MOMENTS YOU WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THE MOST? BECAUSE, CERTAINLY, COURTNEY, THERE ARE MOMENTS LIKE, "IF THE GLOVE DOES NOT FIT, YOU MUST ACQUIT." AND "IT'S AN OUT RAGE." AND "WHO AM I NOW?" THOSE ARE GREAT, ALMOST POTETTIC MOMENTS FROM JOHNNIE COCHRAN.
DO YOU THAT VERY WELL.
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I BET YOU DO IT BETTER.
WE WERE-- YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS HARD-- MY WIFE PLAYED TINA TURNER, AND THE PRESSURE-- JAMIE FOXX WITH RAY CHARLES, THE PRESSURE-- GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.
Stephen: ANGELA BASSET. THE GREAT ANGELA BASSET.
SO THE PRESSURE, I THINK, UNDER SOMEONE-- PLAYING SOMEONE WHO IS ICONIC LIKE THAT IS, I THINK, TO FIGURE OUT WHERE DO YOU START? WHERE DO YOU BEGIN? YOU DON'T WANT TO IMITATE. SO MYSELF I SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH ANY FOOTAGE. I'M NOT GOING-- I'M JUST GOING TO READ AS MUCH AS I CAN, BECAUSE I KNOW ONCE THEY START THIRD EPISODE, WE'RE GOING TO BE WALL TO WALL FOR FIVE MONTHS. WE DIDN'T HAVE A BREAK FOR FIVE MONTHS. AND THE AMOUNT OF VERBIAGE THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE SPOUT. THERE WERE TIMES AND THEY'VE GOT FIVE CAMERAS SWIRLING AROUND US, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK TO SOMEONE, JUDGE ITO RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, AND THERE ARE SIX CAMERAS SWIRLING. SOMETIMES YOU JUST-- YOU LOSE YOURSELF, AND YOU CAN'T-- YOU CAN'T DO IT.
FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF, THERE'S A RECOGNIZABILITY FACTOR, SO YOU HAVE TO DISGUISE YOURSELF TO INVITE AN AUDIENCE IN, TO TAKE THIS TRIP WITH YOU IN TELLING THE STORY. SO IT WAS IMPORTANT, I FELT, TO LOOK AND SOUND AND BEHAVE LIKE THE ACTUAL SHAPIRO.
Stephen: WELL, YOU DO, YOU DO. WE HAVE A LITTLE CLIP HERE. JIM, CAN YOU SHOW THE CLIP OF JOHN AS SHAPIRO.
LEFT THE GRAND JURY TO MAKE THIS CALL. WHERE IS YOUR CLIENT?
MASH AI'M SORRY, BUT HE'S WITH A FEW DOCTORS. HE'S VERY DEPRESSED.
YEAH, WELL, SHE HAD BEEN DEPRESSED. HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE. HE'S GOING TO LOCATION. WHAT IS YOUR LOCATION.
HERE'S ONE OF THE DOCTORS NOW.
SAUL.
HELLO.
WHO IS THIS?
I'M A PSYCHIATRIST, WHO IS THIS.
THIS IS DISTRICT ATTORNEY MARCIA CLARK. WHERE ARE YOU? WE HAVE A WARRANT FOR THIS MAN'S ARREST. NOW, DOCTOR, AS I AM SURE YOU ARE AWARE THERE ARE LAWS RELATED TO THE AIDING AND ABETTING OF A FUGITIVE, IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THESE LAWS LET ME MAKE THEM CLEAR TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT GOING TO JAIL FOR THIS.
APOLOGIZE, DO YOU HAVE A PEN? I'LL GIVE YOU THE ADDRESS. WE'RE IN ENCINO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: IT'S GETTING INCREDIBLE REVIEWS. IT'S GETTING INCREDIBLE REVIEWS. WHAT WAS SHAPIRO? WAS HE ACTUALLY THE SMARTEST GUY IN THE ROOM, OR DID HE KNOW HOW TO HIRE THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM?
I THINK HE KNEW HOW TO HIRE THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM. I THINK HE WAS SHREWD, AND LET'S SAY AWEIDATION, AND I THINK THAT MIXTURE ALLOWED HIM TO-- I THINK SOME LAWYERS, THEIR ABILITY IS TO CHOOSE WELL EXPERTS IN OTHER AREAS.
Stephen: HE SEEMS LIKE A RINGMASTENER THAT SCENE.
EXACTLY. AND I THINK HE WAS TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE.
Stephen: COURTNEY, WHY DO YOU THINK JOHNNIE COCHRAN TOOK THIS CASE? WAS HE DOING THIS FOR PERSONAL GLORY? WAS THIS PERSONAL FOR HIM, TRYING VINDICATE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO IS ACCUSED OF SOMETHINGAR SO OFTEN AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE FALSELY ACCUSED IN HIS MIND?
I THINK HE GOT-- INITIALLY, HE WASN'T GOING TO DO IT. HIS WIFE WAS THE ONE, I THINK, AS YOU-- THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REVEALED. THAT'S ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF DOING THIS PROJECT IS THAT YOU START TO-- YOU SEE ALL WONDERFUL THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT BEFORE. I THINK HE CUT HIS TEETH ON THESE KINDS OF CASES. LEONARD DEBTWIELER, AND OTHERS LIKE HIM WHO WERE REALLY ABUSED BY THE L.A.P.D., AND HE WOULD STEP IN AND HELP AND TRY TO VINDICATE THESE PEOPLE. SO THIS WAS A CASE, THOUGH HE THOUGHT HE COULDN'T WIN SO, HE WASN'T GOING TO DO IT. BUT HIS WIFE SAID, "I THINK YOU BETTER TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS CASE." AND SO HE DID. AND I THINK HE REALLY WENT INTO IT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED-- EMMITT TILL AND ALL THE OTHER THINGSES, ROSA PARKS, MARTIN LUTHER KING-- ALL THE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE, HE THOUGHT I'M GOING TO STEP IN FOR THEM. AND THAT'S WHO I THINK AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE CELEBRATING AT THE VERDICT WAS NOT O.J. SIMPSON, WAS JOHNNIE COCHRAN AND THE INJUSTICES OF PAST.
Stephen: I'M SURPRISED IT TOOK THIS LONG TO TELL THIS STORY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
JOHN TRAVOLTA AND COURTNEY B. VANCE, "THE PEOPLE V. O.J. SIMPSON: AMERICAN CRIME STORY" PRETEARS TOMORROW AT 10 P.M. ON FX. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I REALIZED LATELY I'VE GOT A LITTLE CRUSH ON THIS SHOW. I THINK SHE'S KIND OF CUTE AND I HOPE SHE LIKES ME BACK. AND ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE THIS SHOW IS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO TALK ABOUT SO MANY OF MY PERSONAL INTERESTS:  SCIENCE, POLITICS, THE REHYDRATING BOOST OF MOUNTAIN DEW KICKSTART. BUT SOMETIMES I LONG TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DEEPER WITH ANOTHER DEEP PERSON. AND WHEN I GET THE URGE TO SCRATCH MY DEEP ITCH-- OR MY DITCH, IF YOU WILL-- I LIKE TO ASK BIG QUESTIONS WITH EVEN BIGGER STARS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MAN, IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. I JUST LOVE LISTENING TO ALL THOSE FROGS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YAY! WHAT A NICE NIGHT! YUP, YUP. YEAH, THANK YOU, STEPHEN. I LOVE LISTENING TO YOU, TOO.
Stephen: HEY, KERMIT, YOU YOU EVER WONDER WHY WE'RE HERE?
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOUR PEOPLE REACHED OUT TO MY AGENT? I'M PRETTY SURE ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW.
Stephen: HEY, CERMT THE FROG?
YES, STEPHEN THE PERSON?
Stephen: IF YOU HAD A TIME MACHINE AND COULD GO BACK, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL YOUR CHILDHOOD SELF?
I WOULD SAY, "JUST WAIT. YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT WHEN YOU GROW YOUR LEGGING."
Stephen: OH, YEAH.
YEAH.
Stephen: I BET THAT REALLY COMESAISE SURPRISE.
PRETTY TOUGH WHEN YOUR TAIL FALLS OFF.
Stephen: KERMIT, DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU SOMETHING MAN TO FROG?
SURE, SURE.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK IT'S TRULY BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE?
YEAH, UNLESS IT'S A HIGH FIVE, AND THEN EVERYBODY WINS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. GIVE ME ONE. GIVE ME ONE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HIT ME, PAL. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW'S THAT? I THINK WE MADE THAT WORK. ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE-- WHAT'S THE BIGGEST NUMBER YOU CAN THINK OF?
OH, HMMM, 8.
Stephen: JUST-- JUST 8?
WELL, LISTEN, PAL YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN PERSON. IT'S HUGE. ( LAUGHTER ) HEY, STEPHEN, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST REGRET?
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NOT INVENTING SUITCASE WHEELS.
I KNOW, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US THE WHOLE TIME. WHY WERE WE DRAGGING THEM? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. COULD HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY.
YUP.
Stephen: A LOT OF GREEN.
A COUPLE OF WHEELS. HEY, LISTEN, STEPHEN, DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HOW STATISTICALLY, OF COURSE, WE ARE BREATHING THE VERY SAME AIR MOLECULES THAT ALBERT EINSTEIN BOUNCE BREATHED?
Stephen: I WAS WONDERING WHAT THAT SMELL WAS.
YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S BAD. IT'S JUST LIKE AN OLD DUSTY BOOK OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
Stephen: HEY, KERM.
YEAH, STEVE-A-RIMO.
Stephen: WHAT IS THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING?
WELL, I FIGURE IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS... YOU KNOW? ( LAUGHTER )
I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER YOUR HAND. I CAN'T-- YOU'VE GOT--
SORRY. YEAH, YEAH, GOOD POINT. HEY, STEPHEN, WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU, YOU?
Stephen: OH, I THINK IT'S 12 WRITERS AND TWO HOURS OF MAKEUP.
OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: HEY, KERMIT?
YEAH, BUDDY.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK MONEY CAN BUY HAPPY JOONS OH, I SURE HOPE NOT. YOU'RE TALKING TO A GUY WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY POCKETS? LAUGH.
Stephen: OR MIGHT I POINT OUT, PANTS.
TRUE, TRUE. YUP, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL JUST... ( CLEARS THROAT ) HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? HOW MANY ROADS MUST A MAN WALK DOWN BEFORE YOU CAN CALL HIM A MAN?
Stephen: OH, THAT'S SIMPLE-- TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE.
OH! THAT'S PROFOUND. WOW.
Stephen: KERMIT?
YUP.
Stephen: WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST REGRET?
OH, SIGNING UP FOR HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASS.
Stephen: WOW. OOOH.
YEAH. ( APPLAUSE ).
TOUGH. YEAH. MAKES MEANTIME TO CROSS MY LEGS AGAIN.
Stephen: YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S TOUGH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: KERMIT, DO YOU THINK WE HAVE FREE WILL, OR IS THERE SOMEONE CONTROLLING OUR EVERY MOVEMENT?
GEE, UM, I GUESS I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT? HEY, STEPHEN.
Stephen: YEAH, KERMIT?
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE WE'RE BEING WATCHED? GLI CERTAINLY HOPE SO. ( LAUGHTER ) AFTER ALL, I'M ON TELEVISION.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND SO ARE THE MUPPETS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Stephen: THE MUPPETS, TUESDAYS AT 8:30, ON ABC. THE GREAT KERMIT THE FROG, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ANN CUDDY. HIGH FIVE! HIGH FIVE! ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. WELCOME BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS A HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR WHO INTRODUCED THE WORLD TO THE POWER OF THE WONDER WOMAN POSE. PLEASE WELCOME AMY CUDDY. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: OKAY, AS I SAID, YOU'RE AWE HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. AND LOOK AT YOU POWER POSING AT ME. HOLD ON. YOU JUST BLEW ME BACK. LET ME JOIN YOU. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE? WHAT'S UP? HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON? I'M PERFECTLY AT EASE WITH YOU BEING HERE AND BEING POWERFUL. SO YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK. IT'S CALLED "PRESENCE." AND "BRINGING YOUR BOLDEST SELF TO YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES." BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW YOU FROM THAT'S THINGS CALLED POWER POSES. WHAT'S A POWER POSE?
SO IF YOU WON FIRST PLACE IN A RACE, AND YOU CROSSED THE FINISH LINE, WHAT WOULD DO YOU WITH YOUR BODY?
Stephen: WOOOOO! ( APPLAUSE ) AND THEN I WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE I DON'T RUN A LOT.
THAT'S A POWER POSE. SO POWER POSES ARE POSTURES THAT WE ADOPT WHEN WE FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT AND POWERFUL. SO WE EXPAND. WE TAKE UP A LOT OF SPAIRKS JUST LIKE OTHER ANIMALS DO. AND WONDER WOMAN, GREAT EXAMPLE. THIS ONE, VICTORY, GREAT EXAMPLE.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT MAN SPREADING? MAN SPREADING IS THAT A POWER POSE?
SADLY, IT IS. AND I HAVE GOTTEN A COUPLE NASTY E-MAILS FROM PEOPLE IN THE WORLD SAYING, "THANKS A LOT FOR MAN SPREADING." I DON'T THINK I SPREAD THAT. I THINK IT WAS OUT THERE BEFORE.
Stephen: I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TONIGHT.
DEFINITELY NOT.
Stephen: OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED YOUR TED TALK ON THE POWER OF BODY LANGUAGE.
YES.
THE SECOND MOST-WATCHED TED TALK OF ALL TIME. WHAT'S THE FIRST, DO YOU KNOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: WHAT'S THE FIRST ONE? LET'S TRASH TALK THAT FIRST ONE FOR A SECOND.
I WOULD NEVER TRASH TALK THE FIRST ONE. IT'S BY SIR KEN ROBINSON, AND IT'S ON EDUCATION AND --
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE NUMBER ONE. LET'S PUSH HER OVER THE TOP. GO TO TED TALK AND WATCH IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT WOOO! IS FROM I WON. BUT IF I JUST GO WOOO! I'LL FEEL LIKE I WON WHETHER I DID OR NOT.
YOU PROBABLY HEARD WHEN YOU SMILE IT CAN MAKE YOU FEEL HAPPY? OR OTHERS-- ( LAUGHTER ) IT MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY.
Stephen: I HADN'T HEARD THAT, I HADN'T HEARD THAT.
WITH YOUR EYES, TOO?
Stephen: REALLY. CAN SMILING REALLY MAKE YOU HAPPY?
IT CAN ALSO MAKE YOU SEEM CREEPY.
Stephen: THAT'S THE PART THAT MAKES ME HAPPY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, I MEAN, ARE WE TALKING, LIKE, MIND-BODY CONNECTION HERE?
ACTUALLY, WE'RE TALKING BODY-MIND CONNECTION.
Stephen: SO THE BODY GOES FIRST.
SOMETIMES. WE KNOW THAT OUR EXPRESSIONS ARE REFLECTING WHAT WE FEEL, BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT WHAT WE FEEL IS REFLECTING WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR BODY S.
Stephen:  YOU CAN TEACH ME SOME SOMAKE ME FEEL A CERTAIN WAY?
I COULD, BUT LET ME JUST TELL THAT YOU IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO JUST SIT UP STRAIGHT. THERE AREN'T MANY TIMES WHEN WE NEED TO USE THESE VERY POWERFUL POSTURES. AND THE AMAZING THING IS JUST SITTING UP STRAIGHT, HAVING YOUR CHEST EXPOAP YOUR SHOULDERS BACK HAS AN EFFECT ON YOUR MOOD AND-- ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?
AND ON-- AND ON HOW YOU PERFORM. BUT THE BIG THING IS THAT-- ( LAUGHTER ) NOW YOU FEEL GOOD. NOW I FEEL BETTER.
Stephen: I'M A LITTLE BIT LOWER.
THANK YOU, YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT ME AT EASE.
Stephen: IT'S THE POWER.
EXACTLY.
Stephen: I'M SITTING UP STRAIGHT.
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE GO INTO THOSE STRESSFUL SITUATIONS, THEY TEND TO MAKE THEMSELVES TINY, LIKE A-- YOU KNOW, A TERRIFIED ANIMAL. EXACTLY, EXACTLY. WRAP YOURSELF UP. NOW TOUCH YOUR FACE. ( LAUGHTER ) TOUCH YOUR FACE.
Stephen: SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BOOK.
LIKE THIS, LIKE THIS.
Stephen: LIKE THIS?
SO WHEN WE GO INTO THESE STRESSFUL SITUATIONS, EVEN THOUGH THE ONLY REALLY RISK IS THAT WE'LL BE SOCIALLY ASTRASIDES, WHICH IS A BIG RISK.
Stephen: SURE!
BUT OUR BODIES GO INTO THIS REALLY POWERLESS, FRIGHTENED ANIMAL POSE THAT MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE'RE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED BY A PREDATOR, AND WE'RE USUALLY NOT. MOST SITUATIONS ARE NOT THAT BAD. WE MIGHT NOT GET THE JOB OR GET THE ROLE OR DO WELL ON THE TESTS BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE POUNCED ON BY A TYINGER AND TAKEN BY THE NECK. SO IT'S-- IT'S-- WE'RE OVER-REACTING AND GOING INTO THIS TOTAL FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODE THAT WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO BE IN TO DEAL WELL IN THESE SITUATIONS.
Stephen: LET'S SAY I WERE HOSTING A LIVE SHOW AFTER THE SUPER BOWL ON SUNDAY NIGHT. AND I NEED A BOOST CONFIDENCE BEFORE I DID IT, WHAT POSE WOULD YOU SUGGEST THEY TAKE BEFORE I DO THE SHOW THAT NIGHT?
WILL THIS BE OTHER HUMANS PRESENT?
Stephen: IF YOU CALL THESE PEOPLE HUMAN, YEAH.  ( APPLAUSE ).
DON'T TAKE THE-- WE COULD PRACTICE SOME.
Stephen: I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE GOOD ONE RIGHT NOW.
SIT, LEAN BACK. I WANT THE FEET UP ON THE DESK.
Stephen: FEET UP ON THE DESK, YEAH.
CROSS THE ANKLE S.
Stephen:  CROSS THE ANKLES. OKAY, SURE.
NOW LEAN BARK HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD, THERE YOU GO. A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BACK.
Stephen: A LITTLE BIT FURTHER BACK.
THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO.
LOOK OFF INTO THE DANCE.
Stephen: HUH.
LOOK OFF INTO THE DISTANCE. THAT'S IT, YOU GOT IT.
