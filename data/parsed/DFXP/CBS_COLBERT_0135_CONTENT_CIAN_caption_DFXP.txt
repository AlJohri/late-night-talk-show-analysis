I AM OFFICIALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN.
TRUMP STILL LEADS ON THE POLLS NATIONALLY.
THE RESULTS ARE IN FROM THE BIGGEST DAY OF THE ELECTION SO FAR. IT WAS A SUPER TUESDAY FOR DONALD TRUMP.
TRUMP WON SEVEN STATES...
TRUMP TRIUMPHS.
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
DONALD TRUMP, IF HE'S PROVEN ANYTHING--
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ANTHONY MACKIE ROB REINER AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY MAXWELL. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"!  Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SHOW! HEY, EVERYBODY! HEY! HEY, EVERYBODY. I AM STEPHEN COLBERT. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." AND WELCOME TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD, BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT HILARIOUS "DONALD TRUMP RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT" THING? HE MEANT IT! ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE TALK SHOWS-- JUST ME. BUT FOR ME, THIS IS A REAL MIXED BLESSING.  YOU SEE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- WHEN TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE WAS RUNNING BACK IN JUNE, IT WAS A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THIS SHOW STARTED. AND WE WERE SO CONVINCED IT WOULDN'T LAST, THAT WE RUSHED TO MAKE A VIDEO TO PUT ON THE INTERNET SO WE WOULDN'T MISS A CHANCE TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT HIM ( LAUGHTER ) TURNS OUT WE HAD NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT-- EXCEPT FOR ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WILL BE THE FIRST MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE WHO HASN'T HELD PREVIOUS OFFICE SINCE GENERAL DWIGHT EISENHOWER. EISENHOWER: FACED DOWN HITLER IN WORLD WAR II. TRUMP: FACED DOWN GILBERT GOTTFRIED AT HIS COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND IT'S FITTING THAT WE FOUND OUT TODAY, MAY THE FOURTH, WHEN "STAR WAR FANS GREET EACH OTHER BY SAYING, "MAY THE FOURTH BE WITH YOU." BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP SAYING "WHAT THE FOURTH IS HAPPENING?" LAST NIGHT, TRUMP GAVE A VICTORY SPEECH WHERE HE PROMISED TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER.
THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS VERY, VERY DIVIDED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, IS GOING TO BECOME ONE BEAUTIFUL, LOVING COUNTRY. AND WE'RE GOING TO LOVE EACH OTHER. WE'RE GOING TO CHERISH EACH OTHER. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.
Stephen: YES, WE'RE GOING TO LOVE EACH OTHER, CHERISH EACH OTHER-- BASICALLY ALL THE THINGS YOU DO WHEN YOU THINK THE WORLD IS GOING TO END. LOVE AND CHERISH, PRECIOUS ♪ GOTTA HAVE LOVE IN YOUR HEART ♪
Stephen: JUST GOTTA LOVE. NO DOUBT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF "TRUMP MIGHT BE PRESIDENT" SEX. AND HE DIDN'T JUST GIVE VAGUE, MEANINGLESS-- IT'S OVER. MY TONGUE HAS ALREADY LEFT FOR CANADA AT THIS POINT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE DIDN'T JUST GIVE US VAGUE, MEANINGLESS PROMISES. HE ALSO GAVE US SPECIFIC MEANINGLESS PROMISES.
WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT SO GOOD. WE'RE GOING TO BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SAYING IT.
Stephen: YES, WE'LL BE SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. IN FACT, I AM GOING TO START SAYING IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT TO DECEMBER. ( LAUGHTER ) MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MERRY CHRISTMAS! MERRY CHRISTMAS! LAST NIGHT, TRUMP WAS VERY PRESIDENTIAL, EVEN OFFERING AN EARLY OLIVE BRANCH TO HIS FORMER RIVAL.
AND JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND TED CRUZ-- I DON'T KNOW IF HE LIKES ME OR IF HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.
Stephen: I CAN ANSWER THAT ONE! CAN I? I KNOW THIS ONE! A TRUMP NOMINATION IS JUST SO HARD TO PROCESS. THIS FEELS LIKE A POLITICAL SHIFT OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS, LIKE AN ACT OF GOD. BUT WHY WOULD A LOVING GOD LET THIS HAPPEN? LET'S FIND OUT. GOD? GOD? ARE YOU THERE?
YES, YES, I'M HERE, STEPHEN. I'M HERE. HOW ARE YOU? HOW'S IT GOING. GREAT-LOOKING CROWD YOU GOT DOWN THERE. HELLO, NEW YORK! MERRY CHRISTMAS! HO-HO-HO! MERRY CHRISTMAS.
Stephen: WELL PANDERED, GOD, WELL PANDERED.
IT'S WHAT I DO. I WANT PEOPLE TO LIKE ME.
Stephen: NOW GOD, I HAVE A DIFFICULT QUESTION FOR YOU.
WELL, STEPHEN, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN VERY MUCH, THEY EXCHANGE A SPECIAL HUG AND THEN...
Stephen: NO, NO, NO, GOD, NOT THAT QUESTION.
GOOD, CAUSE IT GETS PRETTY ICKY AFTER THAT.
Stephen: GOD, WHY DID YOU LET DONALD TRUMP BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE?
THE WHAT? SHUT THE FRONT DOOR! NO WAY! THE GUY WITH WEIRD HAIR WHO SOLD STEAKS AT THE SHARPER IMAGE?
Stephen: YES. HAVEN'T YOU BEEN FOLLOWING THE ELECTION?
OH, MY GOD. HERE'S THE WORST. TEACHEN, I'VE BEEN PRETTY BUSY TO FOLLOWING THE ELECTION. I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH A SUPERNOVA IN ANOTHER GALAXY. I HAVE GOT TO DECIDE WHO WINS THE NBA FINALS. WHAT HAPPENED TO JEB? I THOUGHT HE WAS A SURE THING.
Stephen: A LOT OF PEOPLE DID. A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT. HE WASN'T. IT'S GOING TO BE TRUMP.
WHAT IS WITH YOU PEOPLE? I GIVE YOU FREE WILL, AND YOU NOMINATE A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE A MICROWAVED CIRCUS PEANUT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OKAY, THAT'S IT. THAT IS IT. I'M TAKING AWAY YOUR OPPOSABLE THUMBS. BYE-BYE, THUMBS. GOOD LUCK MAKING TOOLS!
Stephen: PLEASE, NO! DON'T GIVE UP ON US YET. TRUMP MAY NOT BE PRESIDENT. HE STILL HAS TO BEAT HILLARY OR BERNIE SANDERS.
BERNIE SANDERS? THAT GUY'S OLDER THAN I AM. TO HELL WITH THIS. I'M MOVING TO CANADA. GOD OUT! MERRY CHRISTMAS! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! MERRY CHRISTMAS! I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK. IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S SAY HI TO SOME ANGELS ON EARTH, JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: HEY, HEY Y'ALL. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY WATCHED, BUT LAST NIGHT I DID FOUR SHOTS OF TEQUILA IN ABOUT 10 MINUTE ON THE SHOW. I REALLY SHOULD HAVE SAVED THAT TEQUILA FOR TONIGHT. IT WOULD REALLY TAKE THE EDGE OFF THIS ELECTION. IT'S HARD TO WATCH A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: YES.
Stephen: BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A CANDIDATE. WE IN THE MEDIA MIGHT BE ENJOYING THESE CAMPAIGNS TOO MUCH. WE LAUGH AT THE CANDIDATES' FAILURES, WAIT FOR THEIR FALL. IT'S SOME KIND OF BLOOD SPORT. IT'S LIKE "THE HUNGER GAMES." NO, IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. IT'S THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME! OH, WELCOME, CITIZENS. WELCOME, CITIZENS, ALL TO THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES" TRIBUTES, ASSEMBLE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S MAY, AND ONLY FIVE REMAIN! THE CINCO DE MAYONAISE! THE ONLY OTHER SPANISH WORD I KNOW IS "MAS TEQUILLA, POR FAVOR." IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, WE'VE LOST SO MANY BRAVE TRIBUTES. AND TODAY WE LOST WHAT MANY ARE CALLING MORE OF THEM.
BREAKING NEWS. WE'VE JUST LEARNED JOHN KASICH IS EXPECTED TO END HIS BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
Stephen: YES, JOHN KASICH HAS ENDED HIS BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. HE MAY BE GONE. BUT HE IS NOT-- WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN. KASICH, YES. LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT ALL THE TRIUMPHS OF JOHN KASICH'S CAMPAIGN. THERE WAS OHIO. AND HE'S GONE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND, SADLY-- BYE-BYE. BYE-BYE! SADLY, EVEN IN LOSING, TRIBUTE KASICH HAS LOST, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT'S BIG LOSER WAS TEXAS SENATOR AND HALF-KISSED FROG PRINCE, TED CRUZ, WHO JOINED THE RANKS OF THE FALLEN.
WE ARE SUSPENDING OUR CAMPAIGN.
NOOO!
Stephen: NOOOOO! BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, YESSSSS! BUT YOU HAVE TO GIVE TED CREDIT. HE WENT DOWN SWINGING, EVEN WHEN HUGGING HIS WIFE. ( APPLAUSE ) APPARENTLY, HE'S DROPPING OUT OF FAMILY. WITH TRIBUTE TED'S FALLING SO, TOO, FALLS HIS VICE TRIBUTE, CARLY FIORINA. START TO FINISH, HER CANDIDACY LASTED JUST SIX DAYS! LESS THAN A FULL "SHARK WEEK"! ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS A TIGER IMPRESSION. THERE IS NO SHARK IMPRESSION! AND I BELIEVE WE'VE JUST RECEIVED FOOTAGE OF FIORINA STEPPING DOWN.
TED CRUZ!
Stephen: DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY, CITIZENS. DON'T WORRY, SHE'S FINE. AS LONG AS TED CRUZ DOESN'T TRY TO HUG HER. LET US LOOK BACK ON THE CAMPAIGN OF TRIBUTE CRUZ. THOUGH HE CAPTURED 11 STATES, HE FAILED TO WIN LASTING ALLIANCES. JOHN BOEHNER CALLED HIM "LUCIFER IN THE FLESH." HIS OLD COLLEGE ROOMMATE SAID, "TED CRUZ IS A NIGHTMARE OF A HUMAN BEING." AND HIS COLLEAGUE LINDSAY GRAHAM GAVE THIS ENDORSEMENT, "IF YOU KILLED TED CRUZ ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND THE TRIAL WAS IN THE SENATE, NOBODY WOULD CONVICT YOU." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MMM. MMM. YES. SO IF TED CRUZ IS EVER KILLED, WE CAN NARROW THE SUSPECTS DOWN TO SOMEONE WHO HAS MET HIM. AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO SAY ABOUT TED CRUZ.
NO IT ISN'T.
Stephen: A-HA!
NO, IT ISN'T!
Stephen: A-HA! THE FINALIST OF THE GAMES, CONGRATULATIONS! CAPITAL CITY SALUTES YOU! DON'T WE SALUTE HIM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Stephen: WOULD YOU THRIEK SAY ANY LAST WORDS ABOUT YOUR FALLEN RIVAL?
YES, LYIN' TED IS LYIN' IN THE GROUND. HE RAN A TOUGH RACE, BUT HE WAS REALLY BAD AT IT. AND HIS FATHER KILLED J.F.K. PATHETIC.
Stephen: DELIGHTFUL! SHALL WE?
LOVE IT. LOVE IT.

I SPEND A LOT OF TIME. IT'S FUNNY, WHEN I DO MY STUNT, IT'S, LIKE, COMICLE. WHEN PEOPLE HEAR I'M DOING MY STUNT EVERYBODY COMES TO THE SET AND LAUGHS BECAUSE I SUCK AT IT. MY STUNT MAN AARON TONE SEBEST STUNTMAN IN THE BUSINESS. YOU SHOULD HIRE HIM. EVEN THOUGH HE'S BLACK YOU ALL COULD STILL --

BASICALLY YOU HAVE THE SUPER CREWS OF MARDI GRAS. AND BAUCUS IS THE CREW FOR THE WORKING MAN. IT'S NOT A BUNCH OF HOITY-TOITIES WHO GET TOGETHER AND EAT COUGHIER.

Stephen: WELL, THAT'S BOTH AN ACTING CHALLENGE AND A IMAGINE AN EMOTIONAL CHALLENGE. DO YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE NEED TO PORTRAY KING IN A WAY THAT IS NEW?
NOT AT ALL. YOU KNOW, THE THING, THERE'S A GREAT ACTOR NAMED PAUL WINED FIELD WHO PLAYED DR. KING IN A THREE-PART SERIES IN THE 70s, AND EVERY YEAR MY PARENT WOULD MAKE US SIT DOWN AND WATCH IT FOR THREE DAYS. UP UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL, I THOUGHT THIS DUDE WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING. HIS PERFORMANCE WAS SO AWE-INSPIRING I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO REACH THAT IN MY CAREER OR SURPASS IT.
Stephen: WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO BRING TO THE ROLE?
I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE DR. KING IN THE WAY THEY KNOW HIM. YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY PERSONAL FOR ME. I FEEL LIKE SO MANY TIMES WE SEE DR. KING AND HE'S PASSIVE OR A REACTIONARY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT A MAN IN THAT DAY AND EXPAIJ EVERYTHING HE ACCOMPLISHED, THERE WAS NOTHING REACTIONARY. HE WAS AN INITIATOR. AND JAY ROACHE GAVE MEET OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AND ME AND CRANSTON JUST SLUG IT OUT.

94 AND TWEETING. HE'S MUCH MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED THAN I AM. HE AND MEL BROOKS EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, THEY HAVE DINNER. THEY WATCH A MOVIE TOGETHER. ANY MOVIE THAT HAS SECURED THE PERIMETER, THEY'RE WATCHING THAT MOVIE. AND THEY --
A CHARACTER SAYS, "SECURE THE PERIMETER."
SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY EITHER, "SECURE THE PERIMETER," OR "GET SOME REST." EITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS. AND THEN THEY'RE FINE. AND THEY HAVE EACH OTHER. IT'S GREAT.
Stephen: YOU GREW UP WITH COMEDY ROYALTY, MEL BROOKS, YOUR FATHER, STEVE ALLEN. WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON WHO FIRST SAID, "YOU'RE FUNNY. YOU'RE A FUNNY KID.
MORMON LEAR.
Stephen: THE CREATOR OF "ALL IN THE FAMILY," AND "MAUDE." HOW OLD WERE YOU?
I MUST HAVE BEEN SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD, AND I REMEMBER PLAYING JAX, THE GAME OF JAX-- NOBODY KNOWS WHAT JAX ARE. IT'S NOT A VIDEO GAME. IT'S A BALL AND LITTLE METAL THINGS. I WAS PLAYING WITH HIS DAUGHTER AND EXPLAINING THE GAME TO HER. AND, OBVIOUSLY, I WAS DOING IT IN? SOME-- I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD BUT I WAS LIKE AN OLD JEWISH MAN-- "NO, YOU SEE WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PICK UP--" LIKE THIS.
Stephen: YOU WERE DOING MIRACLE MAX.
YES, IT WAS A PRECURSOR, A PRECURSOR. SO NORMAN THOUGHT I WAS FUNNY AND HE SAID TO MY DAD,UN," YOUR SON IS VERY FUNNY." AND MY DAD SAID, "NO, NOT THAT KID. NOT THAT KID. HE SITS. HE BROODZ. HE'S QUIET." BUT NORMAN AT LEAST THOUGHT I WAS FUN GLE YOUR DAD CREATED THE "DICK VAN DYKE SHOW."
HE DID?
Stephen: YES. WAS ANY OF THAT YOUR REAL HOME LIFE.
MY FATHER, HE WROTE MOST OF THE EPISODE, AND I ALWAYS KNEW WHEN HE WAS STUCK CREATIVELY. HE WOULD-- HE WOULD COME INTO THE ROOM, AND MY-- MY ROOM AT THE HOUSE, AND HE WOULD SAY, "HAS ANYTHING INTERESTING HAPPENED TO YOU LATELY?" SO I KNEW HE WAS STUCK AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW. BUT I GREW UP AS A KID,UN, I WAS A KID WATCHING "THE VAN DYKE SHOW." I WOULD GO DOWN AND SEE MY DAD WORK AND IN LOVE WITH MARY TYLER MOORE.
Stephen: WHO WASN'T.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL-- THIS STORY IS A TRUE STORY. I'M NOT TELLING IT OUT OF SCHOOL. MARY TILE MOORE WROTE THIS IN HER BOOK. SHE ACTUALLY TOLD THIS ON TELEVISION. WHEN I WAS 14 YEARS OLD I COULDN'T CONTAIN MYSELF. I WAS SO HOT FOR MARY TYLER MOORE. I-- I --
WITH THE CAPRIS PANTS AND EVERYTHING.
SHE HAD THE CAPRIS PANT, IT WAS TIGHT AND EVERYTHING. AND MY HORMONES WERE RAGING, AND I ACTUALLY GRABBED HER TUSH. I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING --
HOW DID YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY? HOW DID YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY?
I WAS AROUND. I SAW HER WALKING. IT WAS LIKE THE DEVIL WAS TAKING-- LIKE A DIVINING ROD OR SOMETHING.
Stephen: LIKE A HOBO GOING TOWARDS THE SMELLAVE PIE.
THERE YOU GO! EXACTLY! I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR THAT REFERENCE. ANYWAY, SHE TOLD ON ME.
Stephen: SHE TOLD YOUR DAD?
YEAH, BECAUSE MY DAD CALLS ME INTO THE OFFICE AND HE SAYS ME, "I GOTTA ASK YOU SOMETHING." I SAID, "WHAT?" AND HE SAID, DID YOU GRAB MARY TYLER MOORE BY THE TUSH?" AND I SAID, "YES, I DID." AND HE SAID-- WITH A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE-- "NEVER DO THAT AGAIN." SO THAT WAS THE YEAH --
THAT'S NICE, YEAH, YEAH.
THOSE WERE THE PERKS OF BEING A CHILD IN HOLLYWOOD.
Stephen: EXACTLY.
THE PERKS! ( APPLAUSE ) THE PERKS! ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: WELL, AS I SAID IN YOUR INTRODUCTION, YOU'VE DONE SO MANY FILMS THAT EVERYONE LOVES. NOW YOU'VE DONE A NEW FILM CALLED "BEING CHARLIE."
RIGHT, "BEING CHARLIE." AND IT'S MOST PERSONAL FILM OF ANYTHING I'VE DONE. I WORKED ON IT WITH MY SON, NICK REINER, WHO IS ONE OF THE SCREEN WRITERS. HE WROTE IT ABOUT-- IT'S LOOSELY BASED ON HIS EXPERIENCE. AND I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. BUT HE HAD SOME STRUGGLES FROM THE TIME HE WAS 15 TO 19 WITH SUBSTANCES, SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AND HE WAS IN AND OUT OF A NUMBER OF REHAB FACILITIES. AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VERY TOUGH TIME. BUT HE MET SOMEBODY THERE, AND THEY STARTED WRITING TOGETHER. AND HE STARTED WORKING ON AN IDEA ABOUT THE LIFE IN REHAB. AND HE SHOWED IT TO ME AND IT WAS INITIALLY A HALF-HOUR COMEDY, AND I SAID, "NICK I THINK IT CAN GO DEEPER THAN THIS. IT'S FUNNY BUT YOU CAN GO DEEPER." AND EVENTUALLY WE DEVELOPED THIS MOVIE.
Stephen: WAS IT HARD WORKING WITH YOUR SON AS A WRITER. DIRECTORS AND WRITERS SHOULD COLLABORATE WELL TOGETHER BUT THE DIRECTOR MAKES THE FINAL CALL. WERE THIS SIGNS OF STRESS?
IT'S STRESS NORMALLY. BUT THE PARTICULAR SITUATION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES. BUT IT WAS THE MOST CREATIVE, MOST FULFILLING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. AND WHAT IT DID-- I MEAN, WE DIDN'T GO INTO IT TO SAY OKAY THIS IS GOING TO BE A KATHARTHSIS OR THERAPEUTIC EXPERIENCE. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS IT FORCED ME TO SEE REALLY WHAT HE HAD BEEN GOING THROUGH. AND I KNEW A LOT OF IT, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ALL OF IT. AND I THINK IT FORCED HIM TO SEE WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED AND WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD EXPERIENCED.
Stephen: HOW MANY YEARS AGO DID HE RECOVER?
WELL, HE'S BEEN GOOD NOW FOR THREE YEARS. I MEAN, HE'S-- HE'S-- YOU UPON, HE'S DOING GREAT. AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S WRITING ANOTHER THING.  ( APPLAUSE ) YEAH.
Stephen: WE HAVE A CLIP HERE. AND THIS IS HIM GETTING TIRED OF REHAB.
OKAY.
LOOK, MAN, I JUST-- I CAN'T STAY HERE ANYMORE, OKAY. THIS PLACE IS LIKE A ( BLEEP ) PRISON.
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. YOU SEE THESE? YOU THINK I GOT THESE AT A TATTOO PARLOR IN HOLLYWOOD? BE GRATEFUL IT'S 90 DAYS HERE. AND NOT TWO YEARS IN COUNTY. BUT DON'T WORRY. IF YOU'RE NOT DRKD YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP THERE ANYWAY. ( APPLAUSE )
AND --
DO YOU THINK THIS EXPERIENCE-- YOU SAID YOU UNDERSTOOD HIM IN WAYS THAT YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HIM AT THE TIME.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Stephen: DO YOU THINK-- HOW WELL DO YOU THINK PARENTS CAN UNDERSTANDS TEENAGERS WHILE THEY'RE TEENAGERS?
WELL, IT'S TOUGH. IT'S TOUGH IN ANY SITUATION, EVEN IF THERE ISN'T DRUGS OR ALCOHOL INVOLVED. KIDS ARE GOING THROUGH A ROUGH TIME. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THEIR OWN IDENTITIES, TRYING TO MAKE THAT BREAK FROM THEIR PARENTS. BUT WHAT I LEARNED-- AND WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THE FILM-- IS THAT I I WAS SCARED, YOU KNOW. AND I DID WHAT-- AS WE SAY IN THE FILM, ANYBODY WITH A DESK AND A DIPLOMA I LISTENED TO BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOUR FIRST CHARGE AS A PARENT, KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE. SO I WANTED TO DO WHATEVER I COULD DO TO KEEP HIM SAFE. AND I-- WHAT I DIDN'T DO WAS LISTEN TO MY OWN GUT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, IT COMES DOWN TO YOUR-- THE PARENT AND THE CHILD. YOU KNOW YOUR CHILD THE BEST. AND IT'S WHAT THEY --
WHAT WAS YOUR INSTINCT?
MY INSTINCT WAS TO REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WAS CAUSING HIS PROBLEMS. IT'S NOT THE TAKING OF THE DRUGS OR THE ALCOHOL. IT'S UNDERNEATH THAT YOU HAVE EMOTIONAL DIFFICULTIES. THIS TAKING OF DRUGS IS LIKE SELF-MEDICATING. YOU'RE TRYING TO FEEL BETTER, MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER. SO YOU HAVE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT'S CAUSING THE DISCOMFORT AND THE PAIN. AND IN EVERY KID'S CASE, IT'S DIFFERENT. AND THE PARENT'S GOING TO KNOW THAT, OR AT LEAST UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I THINK. BUT THAT'S JUST ME,UN, JUST ME.  ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT STORY WITH THE REST OF US.
YEAH.
