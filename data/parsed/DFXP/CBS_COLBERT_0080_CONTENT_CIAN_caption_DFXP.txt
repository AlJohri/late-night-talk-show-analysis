STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT."
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY! FEELING IT. FEELINFEELING IT. THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, IN HERE, DOWN THERE, THANK YOU, YOU FOLKS OVER THERE, WITH THE VEST. THANK YOU. HEY! HEY, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT." I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. AND I LOVE YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS YOU KNOW-- THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE IN THE ROOM TONIGHT. A LOT OF LOVE IN THE ROOM. KEEP YOUR HANKIES HANDY. AS YOU KNOW, I TAKE MY JOB AS A LATE NIGHT HOST VERY SERIOUSLY. I COME OUT HERE AND HAVE FUN, HA-HA, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S MY DUTY TO LOOK OUT FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN MY AUDIENCE. WHICH REMINDS ME-- CARLY, HE'S NOT RIGHT FOR YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) DUMP HIM AND FINISH YOUR M.F.A. IT'S YOUR DREAM. VERNON, GO WITH THE VINYL FENCING. WOOD ROTS, AND YOU END UP SPENDING JUST AS MUCH REPLACING IT. PRINCE ABAKUTAR, YOUR NINTH WIFE IS A DECEIVER. ACCUSE HER BEFORE THE ELDERS AS A SORCERESS. TRUST ME. AND THERE'S SOME NEWS I NEED TO SHARE WITH EVERYBODY HERE TONIGHT, BECAUSE YESTERDAY, ATOMIC SCIENTISTS UPDATED SOMETHING CALLED THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK. IT'S A SYMBOLIC CLOCK THAT GETS ADJUSTED EVERY YEAR TO REFLECT HOW CLOSE HUMANITY IS TO DESTROYING ITSELF, WITH MIDNIGHT REPRESENTING THE APOCALYPSE. IT IS THE ONLY CLOCK MORE TERRIFYING THAN THE ONE THAT WAKES YOU UP EVERY MORNING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YESTERDAY, AT THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, ATOMIC SCIENTISTS REVEALED THAT HUMANITY STANDS AT THREE MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. YEAH, YEAH.
Audience: OH!
Stephen: THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. THAT IS TOUGH. A LOT OF US WERE HOPING WE'D GAIN AN HOUR FOR DOOMSLIGHT SAVINGS TIME. THE WHOLE THING, SET IT BACK A LITTLE BIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SET THE CLOCK BACK!
Stephen: BECAUSE THREE MINUTES, NOT GOOD. THREE MINUTES ONLY LEAVES YOU ENOUGH TIME TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH AND THROW ON YOUR LAST NIGHT'S PANTS BEFORE THE WORLDENS. NOW, THE END OF THE WORLD IS SCARY, YES. BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK IS JUST BASED ON TENSIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE. AND WE CAN ALL DO SOMETHING TO REDUCE TENSIONS AND HELP MOVE THE CLOCK BACK NEXT YEAR. SO EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT, EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM, EVERYBODY AT HOME, I WANT YOU TO TURN TO THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU, AND I WANT YOU TO DO THIS. I WANT YOU TO GET A SHOT OF THIS. TURN TO THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU AND GIVE THEM A HUG. JON, LET'S DO THIS THING. IT'S ABOUT LOVE. SHARE A MOMENT. HUG EACH OTHER. THAT'S IT, HUG IT OUT. HUG IT OUT, YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FEEL THAT?
Jon: I FEEL THE LOVE. I FEEL THE LOVE. WOW. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY HERE TOGETHER ON THIS PLANET FOR THE BLINK OF AN EYE. AND THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, WHAT YOU JUST DID. AND NOW THAT WE'VE MADE AN INTIMATE, HUMAN CONNECTION. EVEN IF WE DON'T AFFECT THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK, I CAN MOVE THE "LATE SHOW" ORGY CLOCK ONE MINUTE CLOSER TO MIDNIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK IS AT THREE MINUTE TO MIDNIGHT THE ORGY CLOCK NOW STANDS AT TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. SO WHEN THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK HITS ONE MINUTE TO MIDNIGHT, MY CLOCK MOVES TO "ORGY O'CLOCK," AND IT IS THE FREAK-POCALYPSE. TUNE IN NEXT YEAR. SEE HOW CLOSE WE GET. BUT EVEN WITHOUT AN ORGY, WE A PRETTY GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FIRST-- FIRST, I'LL TALK TO ACTOR CHRIS PINE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WOW! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH. INCHTS OF.
Jon: EVERYBODY LOVES CHRIS PINE.
Stephen: I GOTTA SAY, THAT WAS MY FIRST REACTION, TOO. HE STARS IN THE NEW MOVIE "THE FINEST HOURS," WHICH I'D LIKE TO THINK, ARE 11:30 TO 12:30 MONDAY TO FRIDAY ON CBS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEN, FROM "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK," I'LL BE JOINED BY THE GREAT ACTOR DANIELLE BROOKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ISN'T THAT NICE?
Jon: SHE'S THE BEST!
Stephen: AS I SAID, SHE'S IN "ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK." SHE'S IN THE BROADWAY MUSICAL "THE COLOR PURPLE." NEXT I THINK SHE'S DOING A PROJECT WITH PINK AND THE BLUE MAN GROUP. THEN I'LL SIT DOWN WITH COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT JONAH REIDER, WHO RUNS A RESTAURANT FROM HIS COLLEGE DORM ROOM. THEY DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S A SOCK ON THE DOOR. ( APPLAUSE ) AND, FINALLY, WE'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE BY BROOKLYN-BASED ARTIST BAAUER. HE PIONEERED A NEW GENRE OF MUSIC CALLED ELECTRO-TRAP. WHICH REMINDS ME, I STILL HAVE A RACCOON IN MY HOME'S ELECTRO-TRAP. ( BAND PLAYING ) THAT RIGHT THERE IS FINE SOUNDS OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO SPRING THE JAZZ TRAP, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: DELOREANS ARE BEING PRODUCED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 35 YEARS, EITHER THAT OR DOC BROWN FINALLY FIXED THE FLUX CAPACITOR.
TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES ACTOR CHRIS PINE. FROM BROADWAY'S "THE COLOR PURPLE," DANIELLE BROOKS. DORM ROOM CHEF JONAH REIDER. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY BAAUER. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN!
Stephen: OH, THAT'S NICE. THAT'S VERY NICE. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, YOU GIVE ME TOO MUCH, I WILL TRY TO DO A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT WORTHY OF THE DOUBLE CHANT. HEY, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD OF THIS GUY, BERNIE SANDERS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THE VERMONT SENATOR AND MAN WHO BRUSHES HIS HAIR WITH A BALLOON IS NOW AHEAD IN BOTH IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT AROUND THIS FELLOW. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW ASKING, SINCE HE SEEMS SERIOUS, "WILL BERNIE SANDERS BE READY ON DAY ONE?" WELL, WE SHALL SEE. WE KNOW HE'S NOT GONNA BE READY FOR THE INAUGURAL BALL. BECAUSE LAST WEEK, SENATOR SANDERS ADMITTED HE'S NEVER OWNED OR WORN A TUXEDO. AND FROM THAT, I DREW THE ONLY POSSIBLE CONCLUSION: BERNIE SANDERS COULD NOT GET A DATE TO PROM. SO I CHALLENGED YOU TO MAKE BERNIE'S PROM DREAMS COME TRUE BY PHOTOSHOPPING YOURSELF INTO THIS PROM PHOTO AND TWEETING IT WITH THE HASHTAG "BERNIE-PROMPOSAL." AND YOU GUYS CAME THROUGH WITH SOME GREAT SUBMISSIONS, WHICH WHO HAS-- DOWCH THE THING? DO YOU HAVE THE CARDS? THANKS VERY MUCH. S THIS LIZ LEVIN, EVERYBODY. SHE'S ONE OF OUR PRODUCERS. SAY HI. LIZ, SIT DOWN. THIS IS LIZ. LIZ, HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD!
Stephen: YOU'RE GOOD. OKAY, LIZ IS ONE OF MY SUPERVISING PRODUCERS HERE. WHAT ARE YOU PRODUCING RIGHT NOW?
TWT TWILIGHT ZONE."
Stephen: DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THEY WON'T LAUGH LATER. WHAT'S THE NEXT THING? DO YOU NEED A MEETING WITH ME BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW BEFORE. PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT. WE'VE HAD SOME MEETINGS HERE AT THE DESK BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO MEET WITH ME DURING THE DAY SO YOU COME OUT HERE AND MEET WITH ME.
RIGHT.
Stephen: WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO NEXT WITH YOU?
WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, BUT MORE PRESSING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FLIGHT TO CATCH TONIGHT.
Stephen: TONIGHT?
YES.
Stephen: RIGHT NOW IT'S 5:20. WHAT TIME DO WE HAVE TO LEAVE HERE?
SO, NORMALLY, I WOULD LIE TO YOU AND TELL YOU WE HAVE TO LEAVE IN, LIKE, HALF AN HOUR, BUT WE ABSOLUTELY TRUTHFULLY HAVE TO LEAVE AT 6:30, OR WE'RE IN TROUBLE.
Stephen: YOU NORMALLY LIE TO ME. SO IS 6:30 A LIE.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE TRUTH.
Stephen: THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY BECAUSE THE SHOW TAKE A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AND IT'S 5:20 RIGHT NOW. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T MAKE THE FLIGHT. WHERE ARE WE GO?
WE'RE GOING TO WASHINGTON, D.C.
Stephen: OH, YEAH, THAT'S A PLACE I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD WANT TO GO BACK TO BUT I WANT TO DO THIS. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T MAKE THE FLIGHT?
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE FLIGHT. WE HAVE TO.
Stephen: HUMOR ME. OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE NEVER MUSSED A FLIGHT WITH YOU.
NO, WE HAVE.
Stephen: WE HAVE MISSED FLIGHTS?
YES.
Stephen: BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS ONE. IN A WORLD WHERE TEACUPS DANCE AND MONKEYS EAT MEAT, IF WE MISS THE FLIGHT, WHAT HAPPENS?
WE'LL DRIVE.
Stephen: WE'LL DRIVE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT WILL BE FUN.
IT WILL BE FUN.
Stephen: SNOWY HIGHWAY. YOU CAN STICK AROUND?
YEAH, SURE.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. SO I'VE GOT YOUR TWITTER SUBMISSIONS RIGHT HERE. I HAVE LIZ PRINT OUT TWITTER FOR ME EVERY DAY. IT'S A HUGE TIME SAVER. DID YOU GO TO PROM?
I DID GO TO PROM.
Stephen: WHO DID YOU GO WITH?
A NICE BASEBALL PLAYER WHO IS A YEAR OLD FRER DARTMOUTH. I CANNOT REMEMBER HIS NAME.
Stephen: IN PROM, HE WENT TO DARTMOUTH. SO A COLLEGE GUY TOOK YOU TO PROGRAM IT DOES NOT SOUND GOOD.
NO, NO, HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE'S BOYFRIEND'S FRIEND. HE AND I HAD NEVER MET EACH OTHER SO IT WAS SORT OF LIKE A CHARITY --
STILL A COLLEGE GUY TOOK YOU TO PROM.
THAT WAS GOOD.
Stephen: GOOD GOODFOR YOU. IF I WAS YOUR DAD I WOULD GO, "YOU CANNOT DO THAT."
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INDEPENDENT.
Stephen: REALLY?
DEPRESSINGLY INNOCENT, ACTUALLY. THE FIRST "BERNIE PROMPOSAL" WE HAVE-- DO WE STILL HAVE TIME FOR THIS? THE FIRST "BERNIE PROMPOSAL" IS FROM @PIPERROBBINS. IT'S HER ACTUAL PROM PICTURE WITH BERNIE. SEEMS TO BE HAVING A GOOD TIME THERE. CLEARLY, THE NIGHT IS YOUNG, AND SO IS ONE OF THEM. FROM @RYANACAST THERE'S BERNY AND DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S NICE. IT LOOKS WRONG, BUT IT FEELS SO RIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S THE INTERNET THERE HAD TO BE ONE OF BERNIE SAND WERS A KITTEN. HERE'S A WONDERFUL PICTURE FROM CHRIS B., BERNIE SANDERS WITH GODZILLA. LOOK AT THE HEIGHT DIFFERENCE. GODZILLA SHOULD NOT HAVE WORN HEELS. DID YOU WEAR HEELS TO PROM GIWORE FLATS GR HOW TALL ARE YOU?
I'M 6'2" WITH NO HEELS ON.
Stephen: 6'2". WHAT'S YOUR CUT OFF FOR GUYS?
IT GETS LOWER EVERY YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: ALL RIGHT. LIKE, MARCO RUBIO AT THIS POINT.
YEAH.
Stephen: HERE'S ONE FROM @WORLDVIOLETS SHOWING BERNIE WITH LEFT SHARK. YOU KNOW IT'S LEFT SHARK, BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY BERNIE COULD GET THE SUPPORT OF THE RIGHT SHARK. I LIKE THIS ONE. THIS IS @MATTSCREATIVE, HERE'S BERNIE WITH BERNIE FROM "WEEKEND AT BERNIES." JUST A LITTLE TOO LATE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. AND FINALLY, THIS IS SWEET, A REAL CLOSE-UP. FINALLY @STUMBLINGSTONE MIGHT MY FAVORITE PROM POSAL, THIS IS BERNIE WITH ME FROM HIGH SCHOOL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. YOU KNOW WHY?
REALLY CUTE.
Stephen: ME FROM HIGH SCHOOL HAVING TO GO WITH A 72-YEAR-OLD MAN. THE GIRLS FROM HIGH SCHOOL ARE GOING WITH THE GUYS FROM DARTMOUTH. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I DO.
Stephen: LIZ, I'VE ENJOYED OUR TIME TOGETHER.
YEAH, WE HAVE TO GET MOVING.
Stephen: WE DO HAVE TO GET MOVING. WOW, THAT-- THAT-- WE DEPARTMENT EVEN PUT THIS IN THE TIMING OF THE SHOW.
NO, WE DIDN'T. NO.
Stephen: ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO INTERVIEW ANYBODY IMPORTANT, RIGHT?
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING AWESOME.
Stephen: WE SHOULDING. HONESTLY, DO I HAVE TIME FOR THE REST OF THE SHOW? SHOULD I DO THE REST OF IF OR GO TO COMMERCIAL? SHOULD WE DO THE REST OF THE SHOW? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU.
Stephen: THANKS, LIZ. LIZ LEVIN, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT PLANE. ( LAUGHTER ) HERE'S THE THING, IF BERNIE DOESN'T LAND A PROM DATE, HE COULD STILL DO WHAT THE REST OF US DO AND EAT HIS PAIN BECAUSE BERNIE HAS A NIGH ICE CREAM. IT WAS CREATED AS A SOLO PROJECT FROM BEN OF BEN & JERRY'S FAME. I GUESS BEN AND JERRY BROKE UP. I BLAME COCOA ONO. BEN CREATED A LIMITED EDITION ICE CREAM JUST FOR BERNIE SANDERS, CALLED "BERNIE'S YEARNING UPON OF." WHICH TO SEE MOUNDS LIKE A SOFT PORN PROMO. YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. YOU HAVE AWAKENED SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DEAD IN ME FOR YEARS. I FEEL LIKE A CHRYSANTHEMUM IS BLOOMING INSIDE OF ME. CIZ ME, TOUCH ME, BUT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO. PERHAPS THIS EMOTIONALLY STIRRING JOAN BAEZ ALBUM WILL PUT US IN THE MOVE. I BELIEVE THE TOP 1% HAVE BEEN GETTING 90% OF GETTING IT ON. OF COURSE, THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT FLAVOR IS BERNIE YEARNING FOR?
SO THE IDEA OF BERNIE'S YEARNING IS THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP ICE CREAM, BUT ALL THE CHIPS HAVE GONE UP TO THE TOP. THAT'S WHERE ALL THE MONEY IS.
Stephen: IT'S A CLEVER IDEA. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR BEN. IN REALITY, THAT 1% GENERALLY DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF CHOCOLATE IN IT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE,-- I DON'T-- I DON'T MAKE THE WORLD.
Jon: HEY!
Stephen: I DON'T MAKE THE WORLD. I JUST DESCRIBE IT! YOU'RE IN THE TOP 1% NOW, JON.
Jon: YEAH, I'M GETTIN' IT. OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS THIS DELICIOUS TREAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE WELL-KNOWN ICE-CREAM- EQUAL-TIME LAW. LEGALLY, BEN HAS TO GIVE EQUAL CHURN TIME TO ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES BY MAKING A FLAVOR FOR EACH OF THEM. WE HAVE BERNIE'S YEARNING. WHY NOT "CARAMEL FIORINA?" OR "MARTIN O'MALOMAR?" OR MIKE HUCKABEE'S "LIFE BEGINS AT CONFECTION." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) OR MAYBE HILLARY'S "WHATEVER FLAVOR YOU WANT THIS TO BE." I'M SURE-- DELICIOUS. DELICIOUS. I'M SURE THE PUBLIC WOULD GO FOR BEN CARSON'S "AMBIEN CRUNCH," JEB BUSH'S "DOUBLE VANILLA," AND CHRIS CHRISTIE'S "BLOCKY ROAD." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OR MAYBE-. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OR HOW ABOUT A DELICIOUS PINT OF DONALD TRUMP'S "MAKE AMERICAN GRAPE AGAIN." WHICH IS GRAPE ICE CREAM BUT FOR SOME STRANGE REASON IS STILL BRIGHT ORANGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH CHRIS PINE. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS KNOWN FOR PLAYING CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. HE NOW STARS IN "THE FINEST HOURS," THE TRUE STORY OF THE GREATEST SMALL BOAT RESCUE IN THE COAST GUARD'S HISTORY.
LISTEN UP! I PUT THE SEA BEHIND US. JUST-- JUST LET IT PUSH US ALONG UNTIL WE LAY UP SOMEWHERE. THE STORM'S EASING UP, BOYS. SO WE JUST LOOK FOR THE LIGHTS AND THE SHORE TO GUIDE US IN, EVEN IF WE HAVE TO GO SO FAR AS THE POINT. SO BE IT. WE'VE JUST GOT TO FIND LAND. IT'S BEEN ONE HECK OF A LONG DAY, RIGHT, FELLAS? YEAH. IT SURE HAS. DON'T YOU GIVE UP HOPE ON ME NOW. SHE'S A GOOD BOAT. SHE'LL GET US THREE.
Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME CHRIS PINE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪
I PROMISE THERE'S MORE ACTION IN THE FILM THAN-- THAN THAT.
Stephen: OH, THERE IS SO MUCH MORE ACTION.
I SWEAR TO YOU.
Stephen: LISTEN, I WAS GOING TO EASE MY WAY INTO THIS, BUT NOT TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE PROJECT, BUT IT IS AN AMAZING FILM.
OH, THANK YOU.
Stephen: I LOVED IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: IT'S-- IT'S MEN AGAINST NATURE FOR HIS FELLOW MAN, AN AVERAGE GUY DOING HIS JOB THAT HE KNOWS WELL.
EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK HE CAN ACCOMPLISH.
THIS IS A TRUE STORY. THIS TOOK PLACE IN 1952, AND FOUR COASTIES WENT OUT THAT NIGHT IN THE --
OFF OF CHATHAM, MASSACHUSETTS.
OFF OF CHATHAM, MASSACHUSETTS ( CHEER (. WE HAVE SOME FANS. DURING A NOR'EASTER, ONE OF THE WORST THAT HIT THE COUNTRY IN A LONG TIME, 70-FOOT WAVES, 36-FOOT BOAT, WOODEN BOAT. THEY LOST THEIR COMPASS. THEY CRACKED THEIR WINDSHIELD. IT WAS FRIGID TEMPERATURES. THEY SAVED 32 MEN OFF A FOUR-STORY STEEL TANK THEY'RE HAD SPLIT IN HALF. THEY SAVED ALL THOSE MEN. PUT THEM ON A BOAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO ONLY CARRY 12 HUMAN BEINGS AND BROUGHT THEM ALL THE WAY BACK TO SHORE AND THEY ONLY LOST ONE MAN.  ( APPLAUSE ).
YEAH, EXACTLY RIGHT.
Stephen: AS YOU SAID, TRUE STORY.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND THE GUY YOU PLAY-- THE GUY YOU PLAY, WEBBER, IS THAT HIS NAME.
YEAH, BERNIE, BERNIE WEBBER.
Stephen: HE'S A GUY WHO-- HE'S JUST AN ORDINARY GUY DOING HIS JOB.
YEAH.
Stephen: CALLED TO DO AN EXTRAORDINARY THING. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT I LOVE MY SUPER HERO MOVIES, BUT THIS IS NOT A SUPER HERO. THIS IS A HUMAN-SIZED HERO.
YEAH. I THINK WHAT APPEALED TO ME MOST ABOUT SOMEONE LIKE BERNIE IS HE'S A REGULAR JOE. HE CLOCKS IN LIKE A LOT OF US DO, AND HE GOES AND DOES HIS JOB. I HAPPEN TO GO AND PLAY MAKE-BELIEVE, PUT MAKEUP ON MY FACE AND SMILE OCCASIONALLY AND TRY TO DO MY THING. AND THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE THAT EVERY DAY CLOCK IN AND PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. THAT IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN CALLED TO DO. THAT IS WHAT THEY FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE DOING. IT'S, I THINK, A PRIVILEGE AS AN ENTERTAINER TO PUT THOSE STORIES TO LIFE AND TO BRING IT TO PEOPLE'S ATTENTION THAT THIS-- PEOPLE DO, DO THIS, BEING SELFLESS AND DOING RIGHT AND GOOD BY YOUR FELLOW HUMAN IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS, AND IT SHOULD BE GALORIFIED.  ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS )
Stephen: IN THE MOVIE, DID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TOOK THE JOB THAT YOU WOULD JUST BE WET THE ENTIRE TIME?
YEAH.
Stephen: BECAUSE THERE'S A COUPLE OF SCENES WHERE YOU'RE IN THE COAST GUARD STATION.
YEAH.
Stephen: AND THEN OTHER THAN THAT, PEOPLE ARE JUST THROWING BUCKETS OF WATER AT YOU THE ENTIRE TIME, RIGHT?
I'M AN AWFUL SCRIPT READER THAT WAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU JUST READ THE LINES, NOT THE STAGE DIRECTIONS?
IT TOOK ME 40 MINUTES TO READ THE SCRIPT. I GUESS IT WON'T TAKE ALL THAT LONG TO SHOOT. AND THEN IT'S LIKE --
I GET TO KISS THE GIRL A LOT. THAT'S ANOTHER THING. I THINK IT'S A GREAT DATE MOVIE BECAUSE THERE IS. THERE IS A LOVELY ROMANCE. THIS IS A TRUE STORY.
YES.
Stephen: HE WAS ENGAGED BUT NOT MARRIED YET WHEN HE WENT OUT TO SEA.
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT-- THAT MAY BE THE FICTIONALIZED --
IT SAYS AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THAT THEY GOT MARRIED ON THE DATE IN THE MOVIE AS STATED. IT'S A LITTLE THING. IT SAYS IT GOT MARRIED ON THE DATE THAT WE SAID.
HUH...
Stephen: SO I WOULD JUST GO WITH EVERYTHING IN THE MOVIE IS TRUE.
SO --
NO, BUT IT IS. THERE'S A LOVE STORY GOING ON, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE GETTING SLAPPED AROUND BY THE WAVES THERE'S A LOVE STORY THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN YOU --
THE BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY, DIFFERENT FROM CHARACTERS I PLAYED BEFORE, BERNIE IS A VERY-- HE WEARS HIS HERETO HIS SLEEVE. I THINK A LOT OF US GO OUT IN THIS WORLD AND WE WEAR A LOT OF ARMOR TO PROTECT OURSELVESES FROM GETTING HURT.
Stephen: AND HE'S VERY HUMBLE, TOO.
BERNIE IS AN OPEN BOOK, A WIDE-EYED IDEALIST. HE WANTS TO DO WELL, HE'S A SWEET MAN --
I CAN'T THINK OF A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP LESS LIKE CAPTAIN KIRK THAN THIS GUY. BECAUSE CAPTAIN KIRK WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN BANGING A GREEN ALIEN ON THE FRONT OF THAT BOAT. SOMEHOW--
SOMEHOW MAKING IT HAPPEN.
Stephen: I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT INTO THE FINAL BROADCAST OF THIS SHOW. BY THE WAY. I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL.
KIRK --
WHAT WOULD KIRK HAVE DONE IN THAT SITUATION?
HE'S AN INCREDIBLE FUNCTIONAL MULTITASKER SO-- ANYWAY, STEPHEN, LOOK IN THIS FILM "THE FINEST HOUR," THERE IS A LOVELY STORY BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. I THINK WHAT REALLY-- IT DID, WHAT REALLY APPEALED TO ME IS THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS FILM THAT HARKENS BACK TO AN ERA OF FILM MAKE AGO IT FELT LIKE A STUDIO PICTURE FROM THE 50ss. IT FELT LIKE GARY COOPER FALLING IN LOVE WITH DORIS DAY.
Stephen: GOOD GUY, BEAUTIFUL GIRL, MAN AGAINST NATURE.
YEAH, AND IT'S A MAN THAT LOVES HIS JOB, LOVES HIS FAMILY, WANTS TO DO RIGHT BY BOTH THE MEN ON HIS SHIP AND --
GIANT MECHANICAL SHARK.
GIANT MECHANICAL SHARK. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: I'M JUST TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY TO COME TO THE MOVIE. JUST EVERYBODY.
YEAH.
Stephen: STOW DISAPPOINTING WHEN HE DOES THE THING YOU ON THE CATWALK WITH HIM.
HE'S GETTING THAT DUMP LING AND I'M THINKING WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Stephen: UNBELIEVABLE.
UNBELIEVABLE.
Stephen: REALLY SURPRISED ME. AND STILL ROMANTIC AT THE SAME TIME.
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.
Stephen: ONE OF THE THINGS INTERESTING TO FIND OUT ABOUT YOU IS YOU WERE KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A GEEKY KID. YOU WERE NOT MR. HANDSOME BLUE EYES WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.
PUBERTY WAS NOT, I'M SURE-- THERE YOU GO.
Stephen: WE FOUND THIS. IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOT EASY. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOUR PUBLICIST IS WHO HAS-- OKAY, THAT'S ME. THIS IS ME. THIS IS YOU. FROM HIGH SCHOOL. ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK WE COULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS.
ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS.
Stephen: I WILL POINT OUT. MINE IS IN FOCUS, YOURS, IT'S LIKE TRYING TO FIND A PICTURE OF BIG FOOT. TRYING TO FIND A PICTURE OF YOU.
WHERE IS WALDO.
Stephen: YEAH.
WHERE IS THE BLACK AND WHITE WALDO?
Stephen: IS IT TRUE YOUR FANS ARE CALLED PINE NITS NUTS.
I HAVE HEARD THIS MAY INDEED BE THE TRUTH, YES, INDEED.
Stephen: SOME OF YOUR FANS MIGHT NOT MIND BEING CALLED "PORCUPINE." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
IS THAT GOING TO MAKE IT INTO THE SHOW?
Stephen: THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT INTO THE SHOW. IT WAS ON THE THING HERE, I REALLY WANTED TO SAY IT.
IT SOUNDED FANTASTIC. GREAT DELIVERY.
Stephen: CHRIS, LOVELY TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: CHRIS PINE, EVERYBODY. "THE FINEST HOURS" IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY. ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

Stephen: I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU SAYING HI. YOU ACTUALLY WENT TO JUILLIARD.
YES, I DID.
Stephen: YOU WENT TO JUILLIARD WITH JON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) RIGHT THERE. AND A BUNCH OF THOSE GUYS OVER THERE. THIS IS NICE. ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE A FRIEND ON SHOW?
Jon: YES, INDEED!
Stephen: YOU HAVE IT INTRODUCE ME TO A LOT OF NICE PEOPLE LIKE THIS. DO YOU HAVE ANY STORIES ON JON, ANY DIRT ON HIM.
DIRT? I WOULDN'T SAY DIRT, BUT JON WOULD WALK AROUND THE HALLS IN THE CAFETERIA WITH HIS HANDHELD PIANO --
YOU MEAN FACE PIANO. WE CALL IT FACE PIANO.
ALL THE TIME, VIBING OUT. HE WAS PROBABLY THE COOLEST DUDE AT SCHOOL. HE WAS.
Stephen: DO YOU HAVE ANY STORIES ON DANIELLE? YOU GOT ANY DIRT? YOU GOT ANY DIRT ON DANIELLE?
Jon: OH, NO DIRT. IT'S ALL GLISTENING.
Stephen: ONLY TWO PERFECT PEOPLE IN MANHATTAN RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE CODE OF JAZZ SILENCE. I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. OKAY, SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU BESIDES BEING ON A HIT TV SHOW AND HIT BROADWAY PLAY? HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I FEEL AMAZING. I'M JUST IN ALL OF THESE COLORS, THE ORANGE AND THE PURPLE, AND ANGRY BIRDS, WHICH IS RED, YOU KNOW,.
Stephen: YOU'RE ONE OF THE VOICES OF ANGRY BIRDS. THAT MUST BE FUN.
THANKS. I'M REALLY EXCITED.
Stephen: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT "THE COLOR PURPLE," BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING SOFIA, THE PART OPRAH WINFREY PLAYS PLAID.
YES, NO PRESSURE.
Stephen: NONE.
NO PRESSURE.
Stephen: HAVE YOU DONE THIS FOR OPRAH? HAS SHE COME. BECAUSE SHE'S THE PRODUCER OF THIS.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT'S THAT LIKE? WHAT'S IT LIKE TO DO IT IN FRONT OF OPRAH?
TERRIFYING. MY BODY WAS LIKE THIS THE WHOLE TIME. I BUT I JUST USED EVERY NERVE THAT I HAD TO DO IT. SHE'S THERE WITH GAYLE, AND STEADMAN.
Stephen: ALWAYS WITH GAYLE AND STEDMAN. THEY'RE A POSSE. THEY'RE HER MUSCLE. THEY ENFORCE. YOU GOT INTERVIEWED BY HER, TOO.
YES.
Stephen: WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
ALSO TERRIFYING.
Stephen: BUT SHE'S REALLY LOVELY, RIGHT?
SHE IS.
Stephen: ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE I MET WHERE THE TAKE ON THEM THEY'RE A LOVELY PERSON AND YOU MEET THEM AND SHE JUST GLOAZ FROM THE INSIDE.
SHE DOES, YEAH.
Stephen: I WAS HEALED AFTER I MET HER.
DID YOU FEEL THE HEALING FROM HER? I DID, TOO. I DID, TOO. NOBODY, BUT IT WAS AMAZING. I WAS JUST NERVOUS ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO FORM A SENTENCE IN FRONT OF HER. I WAS LIKE, "UH..." JUST SO IN AWE OF WHO SHE WAS. BUT I FEEL LIKE IT WENT WELL. IT'S THE @OUT AND ABOUT INTO THE WORLD. SO --
NOW, YOUR DAD'S A MINISTER.
NO, MY MOTHER IS THE MINISTER.
Stephen: REALLY?
YES.
Stephen: OH, I THOUGHT YOUR DAD WAS A MINISTER. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
MY DAD'S A DEACON.
Stephen: YOUR DAD'S A BEAK DOOEKON. YOUR MOM TELLS YOUR DAD WHAT TO DO WHEN IN THE CHURCH?
NOT REALLY, BUT YEAH, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: WAS GROWING UP IN A PREACHER FAMILY, WOULD THAT SORT OF INTRODUCE YOU TO PERFORMING? IS, LIKE, CHURCH LIKE A STEPPING STONE FOR THAT?
I DEFINITELY THINK. THEY TAUGHT ME SO MUCH FROM SINGING AND HOW TO PRESENT MYSELF AND ALL OF THIS STUFF. BUT IT'S SO PARALLEL, YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE AND YOU HAVE A CONGREGATION. YOU HAVE THE MINISTER, WHO IS SO MUCH LIKE THE DIRECTOR. AND THE CHOIR THAT'S LIKE THE ENSEMBLE. AND THE USHERS ARE THE USHERS THAT HAND OUT A PROGRAM OR THE PLAYBILL.
Stephen: I LIKE YOUR-- IN YOUR ANALOGY, EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT BUT THE USHERS.
THEY SAY --
THE USHERS ARE USHERS.
THEY STAY THE SAME.
Stephen: HOW DID YOUR FAMILY FEEL ABOUT TAYSTEE? IF YOU'RE FROM-- YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE FROM A FAMILY OF A MINISTER AND DEACON, HOW DID THAISM ABOUT YOU DOING TAYSTEE?
YEAH, MAMMA WASN'T FEELING IT TOO MUCH AT ALL. THE FIRST SCENE I HAD TO BE TOPs, WHICH YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE. I WAS TOPLESS THE FIRST SCENE AND BEFORE GETTING THE JOB I WAS LIKE, MOM, TELLING HER ALL ABOUT IT. AND AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, NO, NO." AND I TOLD HER HOW MUCH I WOULD BE MAKING. AND SHE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT JOB." ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: YOU RECENTLY DID THIS THING. YOU ACTUALLY-- YOU TWEETED THIS OUT.
YES.
Stephen: AND THIS IS A PICTURE OF YOU JUST ABOUT TO WORK OUT. AND YOU THEN WROTE--
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!
Stephen: YOU WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR "GLAMOUR" MAGAZINE ABOUT FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR BODY AND IT GOT A HUGE RESPONSE. WHAT WAS THE RESPONSE YOU GOT?
I DID THIS FOR MYSELF, REALLY, TO SHOW SELF-LOVE. IT WAS SOMETHING I HAD NEVER DONE WAS TAKE OFF MY SHIRT AT A GYM. AND SO DIIT, AND I DID NOT REALIZE THAT I WAS GIVING PERMISSION TO THOUSANDS OF PLUS-SIZE, BIG WOMEN TO GO TO THE GYM AND TAKE THEIR SHIRTS OFF BECAUSE IT BECAME A THING. I WAS GETTING ALL OF THESE PICTURES.  ( APPLAUSE ) YES.

I WAS COOKING A LOT AND MOSTLY SHARING MEALS WITH MY FRIENDS AND ROOMMATES. AND THEY WERE LIKE, "YOU SHOULD LET OTHER PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THIS." AND THEY DID. I MADE AN ONLINE SIGN-UP SHEET, AND --
RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE-- IT'S OVER 1,000 PEOPLE ARE ON YOUR WAITING LIST TO EAT DINNER IN YOUR DORM ROOM.
YEAH. AND THOSE ARE-- THOSE ARE 1,000 PARTIES OF FOUR.
Stephen: WHAT! SO THERE ARE 1,000 RESERVATIONS WAITING.
YEAH.
Stephen: TO EAT IN YOUR DORM ROOM.
WHICH IS, LIKE AIR, LOT OF YEARS OF DOING THIS. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: IT IS, IT IS. WHAT DOES THE SCHOOL THINK OF THIS?
THEY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN PLEASED. ( LAUGHTER )
Stephen: YOU KNOW THERE'S A MOVIE IN THIS ABOUT THE REBELLIOUS YOUNG STUDENT CHEF, AND THE R.A. WHO IS COLLUDING WITH THE PRESIDENT TO TRY TO SHUT YOU DOWN.
YEAH, I HOPE. I'D BE DOWN TO MAKE IT.
Stephen: THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. BUT THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE WANTS A RESERVATION AT YOUR RESTAURANT AND IT SAVES THE RESTAURANT.
IT'S FUNNY, COLUMBIA'S OFFICIAL MAGAZINE HIT ME UP TO WRITE AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT, AND THEN AFTER EXPRESSING SOME OF THE MY SENTIMENTS ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY AND THE RELATIONSHIP, THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'LL HOLD THE ARTICLE FOR A LITTLE BIT." ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING. WHAT DO WE HAVE?
I WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR TO YOU COME, BUT THE LIST IS SO LONG I COULDN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE --
I'LL COME, I'LL COME. DO CELEBRITIES -- WHILE YOU'RE PREPARING THAT. DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.
I WANTED TO BRING YOU SOME LEFTOVERS BECAUSE-- ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.  ( APPLAUSE )
Stephen: I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET. I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET. I HAVE A FLIGHT TO MAKE.
I KNOW, AND SINCE-- SO THIS IS THE FIRST COURSE.
Stephen: OKAY. VERY LIGHT. DO CELEBRITIES EVER, LIKE, TRY TO PULL STRINGS TO GET, LIKE, A RESERVATION? LIKE YOU GET A CALL FROM AN ASSISTANCE SAYING, "I HAVE KELLY RIPA ON THE WAY TO YOU."
NO.
Stephen: "WOULD THAT WORK OUT?"
I WISH. THAT WOULD BE FUN. THAT WOULD BE REAL FUN. I DID A POP-UP IN L.A. THAT REGGIE WATTS CAME TO.
Stephen: THAT'S A COOL GUEST. THAT LOOKS FILO.
IT'S A FILO DESSERT FILLED WITH HONEY THAT'S INFUSED WITH BLACK TRUFFLE.
Stephen: WHAT!
AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING IT EAT WITH IT IS A LITTLE SORBET I MADE FROM PEAR NECTAR.
Stephen: PEAR NECTAR SORBET. I JUST GOT A COMIL. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO AFTER YOU GRADUATE, OPEN A RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING?
I'D REALLY LIKE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE OPEN UP A VENUE OR-- YEAH, SERIOUSLY. AND THEN WAIT. YOU CAN'T DIG IN JUST YET.
Stephen: I'M NOT DIGGING IN. I'M HELPING, I'M HELPING.
I NEED TO PUT SOME LIME ZEST ON TOP. BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M PREPARED.
Stephen: I KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO, YOU'VE GOT TO.
IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL TO OPEN UP A SPACE WHERE ART AND FOOD AND MUSIC COULD ALL INTERSECT. PLEASE, PLEASE.
Stephen: OKAY, AND DO I DO IT TOGETHER?
OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY. YOU'RE NOT EATING VERY NEATLY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen: OKAY. YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU OPEN A RESTAURANT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO YELL AT THE CUSTOMERS. HOLD ON.  ( CHEERS ) THAT IS FANTASTIC.
I'M SO GLAD THANK YOU.
Stephen: IT'S DELICIOUS. UNEXPECTED.
THANKS ( APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: NOW, DO STUDENTS EVER SHOW UP AND SAY, "I HAVE BEEN WITH SOME FRIENDS PARTYING IN A PARTICULAR WAY. WOULD YOU MAKE US SOMETHING TO EAT RIGHT NOW?" ( LAUGHTER ).
I WILL SAY THAT I HAVE A SPECIAL MENU COMING UP FOR APRIL 20. BUT, YOU KNOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen: GOOD LUCK GETTING A RESERVATION.
BUT, NO. IT'S-- YOU KNOW, ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE COME THROUGH. A LOT OF NOT STUDENTS AS WELL, ACTUALLY. SO THAT'S BEEN KIND OF FUN TO HAVE THIS BE A NEXUS UPON ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK.
Stephen: WELL, IT'S FANTASTIC. CONGRATULATIONS ON SUCH AN AMAZING, UNUSUAL WAY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Stephen: JONAH LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.
Stephen: CHECK JONAH OUT ON INSTAGRAM @PITHNYC. JONAH REIDER, EVERYBODY!
