WE ALL REMEMBER HIS BATTLE CRY, CLAP FOR RICKETS. >> NOW DONALD TRUMP IS HAVING AN EXTRA HARD TIME WITH WOMEN VOTERS, ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST WEEK WHEN HE SAID THAT IF ABORTION BECOMES ILLEGAL THEN WOMEN THAT GET THEM SHOULD FACE SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT, THAT WILL NOT PLAY WELL WITH TRUMP'S FEMALE SUPPORTERS, BOTH OF THEM. >> TRUMP, I DON'T KNOW, DOESN'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT, I THINK, OR HE DOES, IT IS HARD TO TELL. SINCE TRUMP TOOK FIVE DIFFERENT ABORTIONS IN THREE DAYS. HE FLIPPED FLOPPED, THEN FLOOPED AND FLUPPED. >> STILL, IF TRUMP IS SLIPPING IN WISCONSIN, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM HIS TWITTER FEED, BECAUSE LAST WEEK HE TWEETED THANK YOU, WISCONSIN, ALONG WITH A GRAPHIC TRUMPETING HIS 37 POLL NUMBER IN GIANT FONT, THOUGH RIGHT BELOW IT IN A MUCH SMALLER FONT IS CRUISE AT 38 PERCENT. CRUZ AT 38 PERCENT. >> AND WHILE THIS DOES CREATE THE APPEARANCE TRUMP IS NUMBER ONE AND IT ALSO CREATES THE APPEARANCE THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW NUMBERS WORK.

THERE IS A QUOTE BY MY FAVORITE WRITER AND HERO WHO IS FEATURED IN THE BOOK, WENDELL BERRY, AND MAYBE SLIGHTLY PARAPHRASING WITH APOLOGIES BUT HE SAYS HE LIKES PEOPLE WHO SEE THE WORK WITH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THEY GET TO DOING IT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT GUMPTION IS ABOUT, IS PEOPLE WITH THE GRIT AND THE GRAVEL AND THE PITH TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK. THEY DON'T GO SHOPPING FOR ANYTHING ON AMAZON. THEY MAKE THEMSELVES A TOOL FROM AN ASH TREE. >> Stephen: THEY KNOW THEY WILL HAVE TO PUT THEIR CUP DOWN SOMEWHERE SO THEY BRING THEIR OWN DAMN TABLE.
