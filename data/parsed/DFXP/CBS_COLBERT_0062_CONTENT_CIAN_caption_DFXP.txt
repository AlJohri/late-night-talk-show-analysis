(  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) >> WELCOME STEPHEN COLBERT! > Stephen: WOOO! WOOO! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! >> Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW" EVERYBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: MMM! MMM! MMM! FEELS GOOD. OH! WELCOME TO THE SHOW, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU! THANKS, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M YOUR STEPHEN COLBERT. WE ARE ONLY A WEEK AWAY FROM CHRISTMAS. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE REALLY BEGIN TO CHERISH OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS BY RUSHING OUT TO C.V.S. TO BUY GIFT CARDS, AND FINDING THE ONLY ONES LEFT ARE FOR SUBWAY AND DICK'S SPORTING GOODS. ( LAUGHTER ) MERRY CHRISTMAS, NANA! ENJOY YOUR $5 FOOTLONG AS YOU BROWSE THROUGH WARM-UP PANTS. AND THIS YEAR-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GHIES KNOW THIS-- THIS YEAR'S CHRISTMAS IS GOING TO BE UNIQUE, BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 38 YEARS, A FULL MOON WILL RISE ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT. I KNOW, SOUNDS NEAT. BUT THERE'S A CATCH-- BECAUSE A FULL MOON ON CHRISTMAS WILL ALSO BRING-- CHRISTMAS WEREWOLVES! OH, THEY'RE OUT THERE. OH, THEY ARE OUT THERE. AND THEY ARE HOLLY JOLLY HUNGRY. ALL BE SAFE AT HOME WITH OUR FAMILIES. BUT ONE OF OUR MOST PROMINENT CITIZENS HAS TO WORK THAT NIGHT. I SPEAK OF COURSE, OF SANTA CLAUS. HE'S GONNA BE OUT THERE ALL NIGHT, COMPLETELY VULNERABLE TO WEREWOLF ATTACKS-- WEIGHED DOWN BY THAT SACK OF TOYS, JINGLING WHEREVER HE GOES! I MEAN RUDOLPH'S NOSE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE A YOU INON FLASHING SIGN, "ALL YOU CAN EAT KRINGLE BUFFET IS OPEN." WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT I'M GIVING SAINT NICK HIMSELF A LESSON IN WEREWOLF SAFETY. PLEASE WELCOME THE ONE AND ONLY SANTA CLAUS. OH, SANTA! >> HELLO! >> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. SANTA CLAUS, EVERYBODY! >> MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE. >> SANTA! SANTA! SANTA! SANTA. >> Stephen: THAT'S NICE. SANTA! SANTA! SANTA! THAT IS NICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SANTA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> OF COURSE, STEPHEN! SANTA ALWAYS HAS TIME FOR GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS. HO HO. >> Stephen: THANKS, SANTA. THIS CHRISTMAS IS A RARE FULL MOON, AND YOU KNOW THAT MEANS. >> EXCELLENT VISIBILITY. >> Stephen:s YES, SANTA, AND WEREWOLVES! >> OH, STEPHEN! WEREWOLVES? PLEASE. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, BUT WEREWOLVES CAN'T ATTACK YOU TWICE. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: WHAT? WHAT? TWICE? >> OH, NOTHING. MY SUIT'S ALWAYS BEEN RED. >> Stephen: WELL, ALL THE SAME, I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM FORESTED AREAS. DEFINITELY SKIP OVER ANY HOUSES ON THE SCOTTISH MOORS. >> STEPHEN, COME ON. YOU'RE A PAL, BUT YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS. CHRISTMAS IS A HAPPY TIME! HO HO! LOOK HOW MY BELLY SHAKES LIKE A BOWL FULL OF JERRY. >> Stephen: JERRY? >> OH, I MEANT JELLY! NOBODY ATE JERRY! JERRY WILL TURN UP EVENTUALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) PROBABLY JUST ON A BENDER. YOU KNOW? >> Stephen: SANTA, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, SANTA? >> NOTHING IS GOING ON, STEPHEN! I'M JUST AN ORDINARY GUY WHO IS IMMORTAL FOR NORMAL, NON- WEREWOLF REASONS. HO HO! ( LAUGHTER ) WHY, I'M AS HARMLESS AS THE EASTER MUMMY! >> Stephen: SANTA, WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST PROTECT YOURSELF THIS CHRISTMAS FROM WEREWOLF ATTACKS. HERE, TAKE THESE SILVER BULLETS. (SANTA HISSES) >> KEEP THOSE AWAY FROM ME! (HOWSL) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: GOSH OF COURSE I HOPE THAT GUY COMES DOWN MY CHIMNEY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. BUT TONIGHT, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU. FIRST, I'LL BE TALKING TO THE STAR OF "HOMELAND," MANDY PATINKIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> MANDY PATINKIN. OH, HE'S GREAT. I MIGHT STICK AROUND FOR THAT, IF THAT'S OKAY. >> Stephen: THAT COULD BE GREAT, SANTA. >> HE LOOKS DELICIOUS. I MEAN, HE SINGS BEAUTIFULLY. THEN I'LL BE TALKING TO PERISCOPE C.E.O., KAYVON BEYKPOUR. HIS APP ALLOWS YOU TO BROADCAST LIVE VIDEO ALL AROUND THE WORLD. MAN, I WISH I HAD SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) THEN WE'LL HAVE A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE FROM GRAMMY NOMINATED R&B SINGER LEON BRIDGES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LEON BRIDGES! HE'LL BE SINGING THE CLASSIC SONG "JESUS GAVE ME WATER." AND WE COULD MAKE SOME SPONSORSHIP CASH IF HE WOULD CHANGE IT TO "JESUS GAVE ME MOUNTAIN DEW: CODE RED." ( BAND PLAYING ) OH, DO YOU HEAR THAT? THAT'S JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN! SAY HI TO THE BAND, EVERYBODY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THEY ARE ABOUT TO MAKE VISIONS OF GROOVE PLUMBS DANCE IN YOUR HEAD BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING. A FLORIDA MAN WAS ARRESTED FOR ATTEMPTING TO BREAK INTO A COUNTY JAIL. HE HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN FLORIDA. ( LAUGHTER ) >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES MANDY PATINKIN. PERISCOPE CREATOR KAYVON BEYKPOUR. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY LEON BRIDGES. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH, EVERYBODY. BOY, I WILL SEE YOU ALL AT THE WEDDING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I'M NOT SURE IF I'VE MENTIONED THIS BEFORE, BUT "STAR WARS." "THE FORCE AWAKENS" PREMIERED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT, AND I COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED TO SEE IT. I'M PLANNING TO GO ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON, AND I ALSO HAVE TICKETS FOR SUNDAY AT 11:30 A.M. IN IMAX. BY THE WAY, I'VE DONE NONE OF MY CHRISTMAS SHOPPPING. I HOPE MY FAMILY LIKES "STAR WARS" TICKET STUBS AND EMPTY JUNIOR MINTS BOXES. BUT IT TURNS OUT, NOT EVERYONE IS AS EXCITED AS EVERYONE IS. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," PEOPLE IN CHINA AREN'T THAT FAMILIAR WITH THE "STAR WARS" MOVIES. THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE TOYS. ( LAUGHTER ) SPOILER ALERT. THE ELVES DON'T MAKE THEM! ( LAUGHTER ) APPARENTLY, THE FRANCHISE NEVER GOT POPULAR IN CHINA BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL "STAR WARS" MOVIE CAME OUT IN 1977, WHEN WESTERN MEDIA WAS SUPPRESSED IN CHINA. HERE'S AN ACTUAL QUOTE FROM A 27-YEAR OLD CHINESE MAN WHO WAS ASKED ABOUT "STAR WARS": >> I CAN'T REMEMBER THE PLOT AT ALL. IS THERE A SWORD OR SOMETHING, THAT CAN SUDDENLY LIGHT UP AND TURN OFF FOR SOME REASON? YES! I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE PLOT. BUT FOR ANY LESS-INFORMED CHINESE VIEWERS OUT THERE, LET ME CATCH YOU UP REAL QUICK. "STAR WARS" IS A STORY OF A SIMPLE FARM BOY WHO BUYS TWO ROBOTS-- ONE LOOKS LIKE A GARBAGE CAN. THE OTHER IS PROGRAMMED TO BE SCARED ALL THE  TIME FOR SOME REASON. I'M NOT SURE WHY. THE ROBOTS LEAD THE FARM BOY TO AN ELDERLY SHUT-IN WHO TELLS HIM THEY MUST DEFEAT A HANDICAPPED MAN WHO NEEDS A FULL-BODY RESPIRATOR JUST TO STAY ALIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN THEY MEET UP WITH A CRIMINAL AND HIS SCREAMING DOG FRIEND, WHO GIVE THEM A RIDE TO OUTER SPACE, WHERE THE FARM BOY MAKES OUT WITH HIS OWN SISTER. ( LAUGHTER ) THEN WITH THE HELP OF A MYSTERIOUS FORCE KNOWN AS "THE FORCE," THE FARM BOY BECOMES A GREAT HERO. SO HE RUNS AROUND A SWAMP WEARING A MUPPET LIKE A BACKPACK. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, THE BAD GUY EXPLODES A PLANET, SO THEN THEY EXPLODE HIS PLANET. SO THEN HE BUILDS ANOTHER PLANET, BUT THEN THEY EXPLODE THAT PLANET. THEN THE FARM BOY HELPS KILL THE BAD GUY BECAUSE THE BAD GUY KILLED HIS FATHER, EVEN THOUGH HE ACTUALLY IS HIS FATHER. AND THE WHOLE THING ENDS WITH A DANCE PARTY WITH A BUNCH OF TEDDY BEARS AND GHOSTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THAT'S "STAR WARS!" THEY ALSO MADE THREE PREQUELS, BUT HONESTLY, THOSE DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE. OF COURSE, STAR WARS IS IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I SAW IT WHEN I WAS A KID AND DREAMED OF GOING TO SPACE. I REALLY, SINCERELY WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. BUT INSTEAD, I WENT TO THEATER SCHOOL. SO NO ASTRONAUT FOR ME. AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK-- UNTIL I SAW THIS VIDEO THAT NASA JUST RELEASED. >> HI, I'M CHARLIE BOLDEN. I'M AN ASTRONAUT MYSELF, AND I'M RECRUITING THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST AMERICANS TO JOIN ME. WE'RE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A NEW GENERATION OF SPACE PIONEERS. DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO JOIN NASA'S NEXT ASTRONAUT CLASS? >> Stephen: YES, I DO, ASTRONAUT CHARLIE BOLDEN! PICK ME! IT TURNS OUT NASA WANTS NEW ASTRONAUTS TO CARRY OUT DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION MISSIONS THAT WILL ADVANCE A FUTURE HUMAN MISSION TO MARS. WELL, I'D BE PERFECT TO GO TO MARS! IT'S MY FAVORITE PLANET AND MY FAVORITE BRUNO. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'M READY TO LEAVE EARTH IMMEDIATELY-- OR REALLY ANYTIME BEFORE DONALD TRUMP TAKES OFFICE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I GOT THE APPLICATION. I GOT THE APPLICATION RIGHT HERE FROM NASA. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND THAT I'M FILLING OUT A HARD COPY, NASA. I'M NOT THAT GREAT WITH COMPUTERS. SO LET'S DO THIS. LET'S SEE-- UNDER EDUCATION, IT SAYS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES WITH DEGREES IN BIOLOGY, MATH, ENGINEERING, OR PHYSICS. WELL, I MAJORED IN ALL OF THOSE IN COLLEGE. AND YOU KNOW WHY YOU BELIEVE ME? BECAUSE I ACTUALLY MAJORED IN THEATER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I CAN ALWAYS-- I CAN JUST ACT LIKE AN ASTRONAUT. I'M AN ACTRONAUT. PLUS, IT SAYS I SHOULD HAVE THREE YEARS' PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OR 1,000 HOURS OF JET AIRCRAFT TIME. WELL, I HAVE THAT COVERED, BECAUSE I AM UNITED AIRLINES PLATINUM FREQUENT FLIER. THIS BAD BOY, THIS GETS ME ONE FREE CHECKED BAG ON TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND AS FOR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, WELL, I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO GO TO THE BATHROOM INTO A VACUUM TUBE. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING WITH MY DYSON. AND LET ME TELL YOU-- THEY REALLY DO NEVER LOOSE SUCTION. LET'S SEE, SPACE EXPERIENCE. I'VE TAKEN ONE SMALL STEP, I'VE TAKEN ONE GIANT LEAP, AND I ONCE HAD A VERY BIG PROBLEM IN HOUSTON. ( LAUGHTER ) BY WHICH I MEAN, I SPENT TIME IN HOUSTON. LET'S SEE SPECIAL SKILLS-- I CAN DRIVE STICK. I CAN SPEAK SPANISH... ACCENT. PLUS I CAN JUGGLE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH, YEAH. IMAGINE HOW GREAT THIS WOULD BE ZERO GRAVITY! IN CASE OF ALIEN ENCOUNTER I AM FULLY PREPARED TO BE PROBED THANKS TO ALL THE PRACTICE I'VE HAD WITH THE DYSON. NOTE TO EXTRA TERRESTRIALS-- I PREFER THE BRUSH ATTACHMENTS. LET'S GET THIS INTO THE OLD ENVELOPE HERE. GET IN THERE. SO NASA CAN PROPERLY SIZE MY HELMET, I'M SENDING ALONG MY OLD HEADSHOT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) OH, AND JUST TO TIP THE SCALES IN MY FAVOR, I'VE GOT A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION FROM MY FRIEND, MR. LINCOLN. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW... NOW, JUST TO SEND IT WHERE NASA CAN FIND IT-- SPACE! SO, PLEASE, PLEASE PICK ME, NASA. I'M THE RIGHT GUY FOR THE JOB. I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. MY ONLY CONDITION IS THAT I GET TO BRING ALONG MY VACUUM CLEANER. WE'VE BECOME VERY CLOSE. I'VE NAMED HIM NEIL DEGRASSE DYSON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MANDY PATINKIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST IS A TONY AND EMMY-WINNING ACTOR WHO PLAYS SAUL BERENSON ON "HOMELAND." AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I EVEN KNOW WHERE SHE IS OR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET HER OUT OF THE COUNTRY. >> BECAUSE IF SHE WERE MY AGENT I'D KNOW BECAUSE I'D KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DOWN TO THE VERY LAST DETAIL. WHEN TO SCOLD, WHEN TO FORGIVE, WHEN TO LAUGH AT HER JOKES. >> EXCEPT SHE'S THE ONE RUNNING ME. >> I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY. ONE PROFESSIONAL TO ANOTHER. YOU'RE PLAYING A BAD HAND. >> Stephen: PLEASE WELCOME MANDY PATINKIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ ♪ ♪ >> Stephen: THANKS FOR BEING HERE, AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YOUR BEARD ALONG THIS TIME. >> YOU'RE WELCOME. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T ALWAYS TRAVEL WITH YOUR BEARD. >> I KNOW. IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. >> Stephen: NICE TO SEE YOU. THE FINALE IS SUNDAY. >> YES, THIS SUNDAY. >> Stephen: AM I GOING TO BE OKAY? >> YESs. >> Stephen: AM I GOING TO BE OKAY? I WATCH IT LIKE THIS GRIPPING THINGS EVERY SUNDAY. >> YES. >> Stephen: IT'S ALL GOING TO BE OKAY? JUST TELL ME THAT. >> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT FOR SURE. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING FOR SURE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE WILL BE SOME-- YOU'LL BE HAPPY ABOUT SOME THINGS AND YOU'LL BE CONFUSED ABOUT OTHERS, AND YOU'LL BE RELIEVED ABOUT A FEW THINGS, AND YOU'LL WALK AWAY WONDERING WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE ENTIRE WORLD RIGHT FLOU! >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: THIS IS THE LONGEST YOU HAVE PLAYED ANY CHARACTER, IS THAT RIGHT? >> YES, I'VE BEEN THERE FIVE YEARS FIVE YEARS PLAYING SAUL BERENSON. >> Stephen: ARE YOU HAPPY? ARE YOU HAPPY YOU TOOK THIS PART? >> I AM. I'M ECSTATIC I TOOK THE PART. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM SAUL. I AM NOT A CALM, QUIET, RESERVED PERSON. >> Stephen: YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE IT. >> NO, I'M NOT, IN THE WAY THAT SAUL IS. AND HE HAS CERTAINLY TAUGHT ME TO LISTEN MORE, WHEN YOU MAY NOT FIND OBVIOUS THIS EVENING. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT HE HAS TAUGHT ME TO TAKE IT EASY AND NOT TO EXPLODE. ANY TIME SAUL EXPLODES, HE KNOWS HE'S LOST THE GAME. SO I'VE GOTTEN A LOT FROM HIM. I'D SAY ONE OF THE GREAT LESSONS THAT I LEARNED FROM SAUL WAS AT THE END OF SEASON FOUR, I-- YOU KNOW, I WAS HELD CAPTIVE, HELD PRISONER. THEY WERE GOING TO EXCHANGE ME FOR SOME TERRORISTS AND HE WANTED TO TAKE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN HAVE HIS LIFE MEAN OTHER PEOPLE WOULD GET FREE WHO WERE TERRORISTS AND DP OUT AND DO MORE HARM TO HUMANITY. AND WHAT I LEARNED FROM THAT WAS THAT WHO'S A BAD GUY, WHO ARE THE GOOD GUYS? AND HE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR, AND HE WENT, "I'M THE ENEMY." THE LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL RUNS THROUGH EACH ONE OF US. >> Stephen: THE LINE OF EVIL RUNS THROUGH ALL OF US. THERE IS STILL FREE WILL. NOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAUSES THE DEATH OF OTHER PEOPLE FOR POLITICAL ENDS. >> BUT ANYONE WHO CAUSES THE DEATH OF SOMEONE ELSE IS PLACING THEMSELVES ABOVE THE LAW AND THINKING THAT THEY ARE GOD. NO HUMAN BEING IS GOD. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE STOP THIS PARADIGM OF VIOLENCE THAT SAUL HAS LEARNED. THAT'S WHAT HE LEARNED AT THE ENDS OF SEASON FOUR. AND THAT IS WHAT HE TRIES TO REMEMBER EVERY DAY, AND THAT'S WHAT MANDY TRIES TO REMEMBER. AND BY THAT I MEAN, IT HASN'T WORKED. IT HASN'T WORKED THIS VIOLENCE, AN EYE FOR AN EYE. AND I JUST-- THE NEW PARADIGM-- WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NEW PARADIGM, AND THAT'S WHAT SAUL IS CLEAR ABOUT. AND WHAT IS THAT NEW PARADIGM IF WAR ISN'T WORKING? WAR-- YOU SPENT $4 TRILLION ON THE WAR. WHAT IS BEING SPENT ON THE MARGINALIZED PEOPLE IN HUMANITY, ALL OF THESE YOUNG MUSLIM, WONDERFUL YOUNG MUSLIM MEN AND WOMEN THAT HAVE NO EDUCATION, NO OPPORTUNITY, NO GOOD SCHOOLING, AND SO WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS SAYING, "WE'LL GIVE YOU A BETTER LIFE." WHY AREN'T WE TAKING THAT MONEY USED FOR BOMBS AND MAKING SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND HOMES AND OPPORTUNITY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHY? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THEN, STEPHEN -- >> NOW, YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A POSITION-- YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A POSITION TO DEFEND BOMBS RIGHT NOW. AND I'M NOT GOING TO DEFEND BOMBS, BUT I WILL SAY THAT-- >> THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BECAUSE BOMBS MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND EDUCATION -- >> THAT IS TRUE. >> EDUCATION DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. >> Stephen: THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES WHO SAY WHY WOULD WE SPEND MONEY OVER THERE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR OWN PEOPLE, OUR OWN SCHOOLS, OUR OWN BRIDGES-- >> WE COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT HERE. WITH $4 TRILLION WE COULD DO A LOT HERE. >> Stephen: YOU'RE FAMOUS FOR YOUR PREPARATION. AND DID YOU DO, LIKE, A RIDE-ALONG WITH ANY C.I.A. DIRECTORS? BECAUSE I KNOW YOU NARRATED THE SPY MASTERS. DID YOU GET TO KNOW ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAD THE ROLE THATTED SAUL BERENSON HAS? >> YES, I HAVE, AND I KNOW ONE VERY WELL, AND THE WRITERS AND CLAIRE AND MYSELF GO EVERY YEAR IN JANUARY, AND WE SIT WITH ALL THE HEADS OF NATIONAL SECURITY, C.I.A., OTHER SECURITY FORCES, WHITE HOUSE, ET CETERA, AND THEY COME IN TWO HOURS AT A TIME, THREE DAYS STRAIGHT, FOR 10-HOUR DAYS, LUNCH AND BREAKFAST. AND THEY ENLOAD EVERYTHING TO US. WE'RE ACTUALLY ASKING THEM WHAT ARE YOU MOST TIGHTENED ABOUT? WHAT CONCERNS YOU THE MOST? >> Stephen: DO THESE CONVERSATIONS CALM YOU DOWN, MANDY PATINKIN, OR DO THEY FRIGHTEN YOU? >> THEY FRIGHTEN YOU, AND IT'S MORE INFORMATION THAN ANY HUMAN BEING NEEDS TO KNOW. MAY I PLEASE SAY A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT FEAR, WHICH WE ARE ALL DEALING WITH ALL OVER THE WORLD. IF HE WERE IS A VERY HEALTHY THING TO HAVE. NO ONE CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT IT. YOU GOTTA HAVE FEAR TO RUN OUT OF A BURNING BUILDING. BUT TO FEAR MONGER AND THIS FEAR MONGERING AND HATRED THAT'S GOING OBEY PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IS SO MISGUIDED. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE OPEN UP OUR ARMS AND OUR HEARTS TO REFUGEES THAT ARE FLEEING A HORRIFYING SITUATION. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND YOU WENT-- I UNDERSTAND YOU WENT DOWN-- I UNDERSTAND YOU WENT DOWN TO GREECE WHEN YOU GUYS WERE ON BREAK. >> YES. >> Stephen: SHOOTING TO ACTUALLY HELP SOME OF THE SYRIAN REFUGEES. >> YES, I DID. I FINISHED SHOOT AGO AND I'M BEEN LIVING IN THIS FICTIONAL WORLD, AND LET ME JUST SAY-- YES, I WENT TO GREECE. I HAVE TO REMEMBER I'M ON TV AND I'M NOT GOING TO BE OUT HERE AN HOUR. >> Stephen: I'M LEAVING BUT YOU CAN STAY. >> I KNOW. I WENT TO GREECE AND I MET SOME OF THESE EXTRAORDINARY FAMILIES. I MET THE PEOPLE IN GREECE WHO OPENED THEIR ARMS AND HOMES AND HOTELS TO THESE PEOPLE, 500,000 REFUGEES THAT HAVE COME ACROSS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS. AND THEN WHEN WE GOT BACK HERE, CALL THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE-- THERE ARE 24 OR 26 ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY-- FIND OUT WHERE SOME SYRIAN REFUGEES ARE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE HAVE FOUND A FAMILY IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY. WE'RE MEETING THEM TOMORROW. WE'RE TAKING THEM AROUND NEW YORK. WE'VE GIVEN THEM CLOTHES. WE'VE ASKED THEM WHAT THEY NEED. AND YOU CAN DO IT, TOO. AND-- AND I GUARANTEE YOU, PLEASE BELIEVE ME, I GUARANTEE YOU, WHEN YOU MEET THESE FAMILIES, THESE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, YOU WON'T BE AFRAID. YOU WILL NOT BE AFRAID. AND I JUST ALL OF US TO REMEMBER SOMETHING THAT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE 50ss, EVERYONE WAS TERRIFIED ABOUT ATOMIC BOMBS. EVERYONE. WELL, ATOMIC BOMBS ARE STILL HERE, MORE THAN YOU EVER IMAGINED. AND NO ONE'S THINKING ABOUT IT ANYMORE. BECAUSE HUMANITY HAS TAKEN OVER. AND HUMANITY IS A GOOD THING WHEN IT'S EXERCISED. AND I-- I ASK PEOPLE TO EXERCISE THEIR HUMANITY MORE THAN THEY'VE EVER IMAGINED. USE YOUR IMAGINATION AND HOW YOU CAN MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. AND BOMB ALL OF THESE MARGINALIZED PEOPLE WITH OPPORTUNITY, WITH EVERYTHING THAT I'VE SAID. AND I GUARANTEE YOU, NO ONE'S TRIED THAT. SO THEY CAN ALL SAY IT WOULDN'T WORK. IF WE CAN MAKE LIFE GOOD FOR ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE I BELIEVE PEOPLE WILL STOP THINKING THAT THE WEST IS SO EVIL.  ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: MY SECOND QUESTION-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ARE MANDY, MERRY CHRISTMAS. >> MERRY CHRISTMAS! >> Stephen: MANDY PATINKIN STARS IN SHOWTIME'S "HOMELAND" WHICH HAS ITS SEASON FINALE THIS SUNDAY AT 9:00 P.M. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. >> Stephen: WELCOME TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE MANDY PATINKIN POWER HOUR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MANDY'S GONE TO REHYDRATE. HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK OUT. ( LAUGHTER ) I LOVE THAT MAN. I LOVE THAT MAN. FOLKS, IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) KEEP IT LIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TREES DECORATED WITH HOLIDAY LIGHTS, STORE WINDOWS DECKED OUT IN CHRISTMAS CHEER, SANTA CLAUSES OUTSIDE OF GROCERY STORES JUST HANDING OUT BUCKETS OF FREE MONEY. IT'S ALSO THE SEASON FOR THE OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY THE SEASON OF AVOIDING EVERYONE ELSE'S EYES IN THE BREAK ROOM THE NEXT DAY. IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOU NOG YOUR EGGS PRETTY HARD AT THE PARTY, AND WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU'RE NOT THAT SURE WHAT YOU DID AT THE OFFICE PARTY AND HAVE TO PIECE THE CLUES TOGETHER LIKE THE GUY FROM MEMENTO. I'M COVERED IN TONER, I HAVE A BITE MARK ON MY BACK, AND I'M AT AN ALTAR GETTING MARRIED TO A REINDEER LAWN ORNAMENT. I LOVE YOU, BLITZEN. BUT I'M CATHOLIC. YOU'RE PLASTIC. HOW WOULD WE RAISE THE CHILDREN? SO THIS YEAR, TO SAVE EVERYONE TIME, I THOUGHT I'D PRE-RECORD SOME POST-CHRISTMAS PARTY APOLOGIES FOR YOU TO SEND OUT TO YOUR COWORKERS OVER THE HOLIDAYS. JUST GO TO OUR "LATE SHOW" YOUTUBE PAGE, OR WHATEVER IT SAYS DOWN HERE. FOR LEGAL REASONS, I DON'T CARE. OKAY, HERE WE GO. "LATE SHOW" CHRISTMAS PARTY APOLOGIES. LOOK, I'M SORRY I ACCUSED KATIE THE RECEPTIONIST OF BEING A JUNKIE. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS AN INSULIN PEN. ( LAUGHTER ) AND, KATIE, I'M SORRY I ATE YOUR GLUCOSE TABLETS. I THOUGHT THEY WERE VICODIN. I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY, I APOLOGIZE FOR STRIPPING NAKED HALFWAY THROUGH MY TOAST. I ALREADY STARTED THE CHRISTMAS PARTY ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. ALTHOUGH I STILL MAINTAIN IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WEIRD IF WE HAD ALL GOTTEN NAKED. AND FOR THE RECORD, I AM NOT SORRY THAT I PROPOSED TO ALLAN ON BEHALF OF RICHARD. YOU GUYS ARE READY. WE LOVE YOU, AND WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY. HOWEVER, I DO APOLOGIZE TO ALLAN AND RICHARD'S WIVES. SORRY ABOUT THAT. ( APPLAUSE ) WHILE I'M AT IT, I'M SORRY I SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM BELL. I JUST WANTED MILLIONS OF ANGELS TO GET THEIR WINGS. I APOLOGIZE FOR DRAWING DOTS ON ALL THE CHEESE CUBES AND NOT LETTING ANYONE EAT UNLESS THEY THREW SNAKE EYES. ( LAUGHTER ) AND FINALLY, I'M SORRY I BLEW OUT ALL THE HANUKKAH CANDLES AND MADE A WISH. BUT IF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE, MY WISH WAS FOR PEACE IN ISRAEL. WHEW, IT FEELS REALLY GOOD TO GET THOSE OUT OF THE WAY. NOW I JUST NEED TO GET TO WORK ON MY PRE-NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY APOLOGIES. PHIL IN ACCOUNTING, I'M SORRY FOR CALLING YOU THE NEW YEAR BABY AND TRYING TO BREAST FEED YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CO-FOUNDER AND C.E.O.

IT WENT LIVE IN, LIKE, MARCH, RIGHT? >> MARCH OF THIS YEAR. >> Stephen: AND APPLE NAMED IT APP OF THE YEAR. WHAT'S THE PROCESS OF BEING APP OF THE YEAR-- CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I GUESS YOU JUST-- ( APPLAUSE ) IT TAKES A VILLAGE. WE-- YOU KNOW, WE MADE AN APP, AND WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT WE LOVED AND WE THOUGHT THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE, AND APPLE HAPPENED TO LIKE IN THE PROCESS, AND THAT'S HOW THEY SELECTED IT AS APP OF THE YEAR. >> Stephen: AS APP OF THE YEAR I ASSUME IT KEEPS OUR COUNTRY SAFE ORING DOES DOES SOMETHING GREAT FOR CHILDREN? >> ALL OF THE ABOVE. >> Stephen: ALL OF THE ABOVE.

WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME RIGHT NOW, AND WHY, KAYVON BEYKPOUR, AM I SUPER NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING? >> WELL, YOU HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ALWAYS HAVING AN AUDIENCE, AND WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR AUDIENCE LAWCH TFEELS REALLY NICE. WITH PERISCOPE, WHEN YOU'RE LIVE, THAT CAN BE PRETTY SCARY SO WE WANTED TO BUILD A MECHANIC SO WHEN PEOPLE LIKE WHAT THEY'RE SEEING THEY CAN TAP THEIR SCREENS AND SEND YOU HEARTS. >> Stephen: CAN I SEND YOU HEARTS? >> YOU CAN SUNDAY HE HEARTS IF YOU LIKE. >> Stephen: HERE ARE SOME HEARTS RIGHT HERE. HOLD ON. THERE'S A HEART RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE. HERE, THERE YOU GO. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >> PRETTY GOOD. WOW! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> DON'T WORRY. THEY GAVE ME SOME EXTRA JACKETS. >> Stephen: SOMEBODY COULD REALLY GET THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE WITH THIS, BECAUSE THERE'S NO EDITING HERE. I HAVE A SHOW HERE, BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THERE IN THAT CHAIR THAT I THINK, YOU KNOW, MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT TO SAY OR IF I SAY, DROP AN "F" BOMB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT-- IN FACT I DON'T THINK I'M EVEN ALLOWED TO SAY "F" BOMB ON CBS. s THIS IS STREAMING OUT LIVE. >> THE WORLD IS SEEING THIS SHOW THREE HOURS BEFORE IT HAIRS. >> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. IT'S LIKE A TIME MACHINE. >> IT IS. >> Stephen: WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF THIS THING. WERE YOU JUST WALKING DOWN STREET AND THOUGHT, "I WISH EVERYONE COULD SEE WHAT I SEE RIGHT NOW? >> WHAT WE WANTED TO BUILD WAS A TELEPORITATION DEVICE. WE WANTED TO SOIT OUR COACH AND GO TO THE SEVEN NATURAL WONDERS ARE OF THE WORLD FROM OUR PHONE. YOU HAVE THE BENEFIT LITERALLY OF HAVING A TV SHOW. WHAT IF WE COULD GIVE EVERYONE THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A TV SHOW -- >> WELL, THEN NO ONE WOULD WATCH MY TV SHOW. WHY? WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF HAVING PROFESSIONALS IF EVERY PERSON CAN HAVE THEIR TV SHOW AND GO, "HEY, WELCOME TO THE SHOW." WHAT ABOUT-- YOU'RE A THREAT IS WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU'RE A THREAT TO ME. >> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE THROWING LOVE IN MY FACE AND ON MY JACKET. >> Stephen: THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. >> THIS ACTUALLY-- FOR ME TO WALK OUTSIDE-- I AM GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A FLIGHT RIGHT NOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SAY TO ME? >> Stephen: "COULD I SEE SOME I.D., PLEASE."

NO BIG DEAL. >> Stephen: IS IT-- HOW OLD ARE YOU? >> HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM? >> 20... 8. >> CLOSE. 27. >> Stephen: WOW, WOW.  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S ME RIGHT THERE. HOW MANY 20-SOMETHINGS IN SILICON VALLEY ARE NOT MILLIONAIRES AT THIS POINT, LIKE, FOUR. YOU SOLD THIS TO TWITTER BEFORE YOU EVEN GOT IT LAUNCHED, RIGHT? >> THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: WHY-- WHY BEFORE YOU EVEN LAUNCHED? WHY NOT ROLL THEM BONES? ( LAUGHTER ) WHY DID YOU SELL IT SO QUICKLY? >> WE-- OBVIOUSLY, WE WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT OUR VISION, BUT WE FOUND-- WHEN WE STARTED TALKING TO THE TWITTER FOLKS WE REALIZED THE VISION-- TWITTER'S VISION IS SO ALIGNED WITH OURS AND WE REALLY FELT LIKE BY PARTNERING WITH TWITTER IT WOULD GIVE US A GREATER PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS WITH PERISCOPE. BASICALLY WE WANTED TO GET PERISCOPE IN THE HANDS OF AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TWITTER COULD HELP US DO THAT. >> Stephen: WHAT ARE THE WAYS PEOPLE ARE PERISCOPING? WHAT ARE THE WAYS PEOPLE ARE USING IT THAT SURPRISES YOU. >> WHAT WE'RE PROUD OF IS THE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE USING PERISCOPE IS REALLY BROAD BROAD. ON ONE HAPPENED, WE HAVE FOLKS LIKE YOURSELF BROADCASTING THIS SORT OF THING WHICH IS INCREDIBLE FOR A WIDE AUDIENCE TO SEE. BUT SOME OF THE MORE POWERFUL BROADCASTS I'VE SEEN IS ABOUT THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISES. I HAVE SEEN GERMAN REPORTERS WALKING ACROSS THE BORDER IN SYRIA WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SYRIAN REFUGEES WHO HAVE BEEN WALKING FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS, BASICALLY LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME. AND TO BE ABLE TO LITERALLY STEP SPOT SHOES OF THAT REPORTER AND HAVE HIM TALK TO THESE REFUGEES AND SAY, "HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WALKING? WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO SEE WHEN YOU WALK INTO SERBIA?" AND LITERALLY SEEING THE SERBIAN POLICE TAKE THEM INTO CUSTODY WHEN THEY CROSS THE BORDER. THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IS SOMETHING THAT LITERALLY EPITOMIZEES YES WE STARTED PERISCOPE. >> Stephen: IT TURNS EVERYONE INTO-- EVERYONE CAN BE A CITIZEN JOURNALIST THAT WAY. >>s THAT'S IDEA. WHETHER IT'S IN SERBIA AND OR THE BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS HERE AT HOME, IT GIVES EVERYONE THE CHANCE TO GET AN AUDIENCE. AND THAT CAN BE SOMETHING CITIZEN JOURNALISM RELATED OR JOHN HODGEMAN SITTING IN AN AIRPORT WRITING ON NAPKINS AND HAVING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WATCH AND LAUGH THE WAYS HE IS INTERACTING WITH AN AUDIENCE THROUGH PERISCOPE. >> Stephen: AND HOW LONG DOES IT LAST. >> WHEN YOU FINISH THE BROADCAST IT STAYS ONLINE FOR 24 HOURS. >> Stephen: YOU CAN DELETE IT IF YOU WANT TO? >> YOU CAN. >> Stephen: PEOPLE, I UNDERSTAND, SHOW THEIR REFRIGERATORS A LOT. >> AS WITH THE INTERNET GENERALLY, THERE IS A NUMBER OF MEMES THAT HAVE UNFOLDD AND ONE I HAVE A HARD TIME EXPLAINING IS LITERALLY FOLKS WOULD JUST GO LIVE AND VIEWERS WOULD SAY, "OPEN YOUR FRIDGE." AND THE BLASTER WOULD BE LIKE, THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD, BUT, SURE, HERE'S MY FRIDGE. AND PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE, "HOLY ( BLEEP ). THAT'S YOUR FRIDGE!" YOU. >> Stephen:  SEE IF THIS WAS NOT LIVE ON PERISCOPE, I WOULD HAVE BLEEPPED THAT FOR YOU. I'M IN BIG TROUBLE NOW. >> YOU ARE. >> Stephen: BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO CBS WHEN THE SHOW IS OFFER. I'LL SHOW THE PEOPLE UNDER MY DESK. HOW ABOUT THAT. >> WE CAN JUST THROW SOME HEARTS AT THEM. >> Stephen: THIS IS UNDER MY DESK. PRETTY SEXY DOWN HERE. THERE'S THE AUDIENCE. THERE'S A VERY ATTRACTIVE AUDIENCE.
