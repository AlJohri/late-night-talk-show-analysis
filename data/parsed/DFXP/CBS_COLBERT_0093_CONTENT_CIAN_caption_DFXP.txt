HEY! HEY! I'M STEPHEN COLBERT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M THROWING HAND TOWELS TO ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE SOAKED TO THE BONE. GREATEST AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD, STAYED OUTSIDE FOR HOURS IN THE POURING RAIN. IT IS ABSOLUTELY COMING DOWN IN SHEETS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LISTEN TO THAT! LISTEN TO THAT! ♪ ♪ ♪ >> Stephen: I MEAN, IT WAS RAINING REALLY HARD. WE LET THESE PEOPLE IN TWO BY TWO. THAT'S HOW MUCH IT WAS RAINING OUTSIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) LIKE THAT? LIKE THAT? >> Jon: YEAH! >> Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS, BUT DONALD TRUMP... ( LAUGHTER ) -- YEAH. YEAH, STILL. HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON THE PLATFORM OF OPENING HIS MOUTH AND SAYING THINGS. THE ONE THING THAT FREQUENTLY EMERGES FROM THE TRUMP HOLE IS... ( LAUGHTER ) , IS THE NAUGHTY LANGUAGE, THE VULGARITY, THE DEVIL'S SAL TEEN. HIESHZ THE THING. AS WE APPROACH PRIMARY DAY IN MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CACKALACK. TRUMP HAS SAID HE IS SWEARING OFF THE SWEARING BECAUSE VALUE VOTERS DO NOT LIKE THE SALTY TALK IF YOU DO THE SALTY TACK, THEY BELIEVE YOU'LL BE DARNED TO HECK WHERE YOU BURN IN A LAKE OF BOILING SHOOT AND HAVE FLAMING HOT POKERS SHOVED UP YOUR (WHISTLE). THAT HURTS LIKE A MOTHER FUDGER. BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY, I'M NOT SURE THE MAN CAN STOP 3 WHY WOULD HE STOP NOW? IT SEEMS NATURAL TO HIM. AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE TRUMP ON TO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM THE MAN HIMSELF, BUT HE'S DOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPAIGNING. THOUGH HE DOES PHONE IN TO A LOT OF THE SHOWS, WHERE THEY JUST PUT UP A PICTURE OF HIM WHILE HE TALKS TO THE SHOW. SO I HEREBY CHALLENGE THOIM CALL MY SHOW. BRING OUT THE TRUMP PHONE! BRING IT OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HERE IT IS. BEHOLD, THE TRUMP PHONE. ( LAUGHTER ) DONALD, CALL ME ON THIS PHONE. IT IS A LINE DEDICATED JUST TO YOU. AND TO SHOW THAT I'M SERIOUS, I WILL AM WILLING TO SPLIT THE CHARGES. MEANWHILE, ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS-- >> TRUMP-TRUMP. TRUMP-TRUMP. TRUMP-TRUMP. HELLO? WHO IS THIS? >> THIS IS DONALD TRUMP. HELLO, STEPHEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: DONALD TRUMP! OKAY, LISTEN I'LL GOT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS REALLY YOU, NOT SOMEBODY ABUSING THE TRUMP PHONE. SAY SOMETHING ONLY DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY. >> WELL, I COULD SAY YOU'RE FIRED. >> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD SAY THAT TO ME BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> YOU'RE DOING SO WELL, THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN, STEPHEN. YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB, SO THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN. >> Stephen: DON'T MAKE ME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DON'T MAKE ME LOVE YOU, OLD MAN. LET'S GET TO THE FIRST QUESTION OF ANY PHONE CALL. WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? >> I'M WEARING A VERY BEAUTIFUL PLU SUIT A POOR TIE. >> Stephen: I'M WEARING A UNITARD AND SILVER TIARA JUST TO TALK TO YOU. >> THAT'S GOOD. >> Stephen: HOW DO YOU LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA. THE BEST PEOPLE EVER, RIGHT? >> I LOVE IT. IT'S A GREAT PLACE. AND I'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES, AS YOU KNOW. BUT IT'S A GREAT PLACE, AND WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A VERY, VERY STRONG PRIMARY SEASON. NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS TERRIFIC. AND THIS SATURDAY, THEY GET OUT AND VOTE, AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE VOTING FOR TRUMP, AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. >> Stephen: THIS IS DEFINITELY DONALD TRUMP. ALL RIGHT. ( APPLAUSE ) LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT EXPERTS ARE CALLING YOUR POTTY MOUTH. I CAN THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THREE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SAID ON AIR THAT-- THIS IS TRUE-- CBS WILL NOT LET ME REPEAT OR THEY WOULD HAVE TO BLEEP THEM. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP? >> WELL, IT'S EASY. I'VE DECIDED TO STOP. I MEAN, I DO THAT FOR EMPHASIS AND I DO THAT SOMETIMES NON-POLITICALLY, AND ONCE I DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE, I SORT OF SAID, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP. >> Stephen: BUT YOU DIDN'T STOP. YOU DIDN'T STOP. RUNNING FOR OFFICE, YOU DIDN'T STOP. >> NO, BUT THESE ARE VERY MINOR WORDS. IN MANY CASES I ACTUALLY BLEEPPED THEM OUT MYSELF. I NEVER SAID THE WORD, AND THEN THEY'LL BLEEP IT AND PEOPLE WILL THINK I SAID THE WORD WHICH IS A LITTLE DECEPTIVE, BUT THAT'S OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ). >> Stephen: I'VE GOT A SUGGESTION. WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SWEAR JAR, AND EVERY TIME YOU SAY A BAD WORKED YOU PUT $1 BILLION IN IT. >> THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. I'M GOING TO DO THAT. I LIKE THAT. >> Stephen: LET'S TALK ABOUT IF YOU WERE ELECTED, IF IT WAS THE LAST YEAR OF YOUR PRESIDENCY AND YOU HAD A ADVOCACY TO FILL ON THE SUPREME COURT WOULD YOU ALLOW THE SENATE TO TELL YOU NOT TO DO IT? >> WELL, THE SENATE REALLY HAS NO RIGHT TO DO THAT. I WOULD CERTAINLY, IF I WERE PRESIDENT, REGARDLESS OF WHO THAT MAY BE. I GUESS I'D PUT IN A NAME. BUT THE SENATE REALLY DOES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THEY HAVE A RIGHT NOT TO DO IT, NOT TO VOTE ON IT, NOT TO APPROVE IT. >> Stephen: SO YOU WOULD LET SOMEONE TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. THIS IS SOUNDING LESS LIKE DONALD TRUMP EVERY-- ( LAUGHS ). >> NO, I'D PUSH. LOOK, IF I WERE THE PRESIDENT, I WOULD BE PUSHING. WHETHER I WAS REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, I'D BE PUSHING. BUT THE SENATE DOES HAVE A LOT OF POWER OVER THAT. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IT-- THEY HAVE A PRETTY DAUNTING RIGHT. SO IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. IT SHOULD BE WHOEVER THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS SHOULD BE THE ONE THAT PICKS THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. >> Stephen: YOU'RE DOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA TRYING COURT VOTES-- ( BOOING ) YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY FRIENDS HERE, DONALD. I HATE TO SAY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE DOWN IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. I WANT TO HELP YOU OUT HERE. LET'S HEAR YOU SAY, "PLEASE VOTE FOR ME, Y'ALL." >> WELL, I CAN SAY THAT. PLEASE VOTE FOR ME, Y'ALL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: VERY CONVINCING. VERY CONVINCING. WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY MAN. I'LL LET YOU GO GET YOUR PANTS ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING US. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> Stephen: DONALD TRUMP, EVERYBODY, ON THE TRUMP POPE. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.  ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: NOW-- NOW, TOGETHER LET'S MAKE THIS SHOW GREAT AGAIN. HOW LONG WAS THAT? FAIRLY LONG? OKAY, OKAY. OKAY. I THINK THAT WAS HIM. I'M NOT SURE. FIRST UP, I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH THE STAR OF NBC'S "TELENOVELA," EVA LONGORIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) "TELENOVA." "TELENOVA." "TELENOVELA" IS ABOUT A SPANISH LANGUAGE SOAP OPERA. COULD I BE PREGNANT WITH HER BABY? TUNE IN TO FIND OUT. THEN, I'LL BE TALKING TO THE CREATORS OF "BROAD CITY," ABBI JACOBSON AND ILANA GLAZER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) YEAH. YEAH! OR AS THEY ARE KNOWN BY THEIR CELEBRITY COUPLE NAME, ABBL-ANA GLA-COB-ZER. THEN WE'LL HAVE A PERFORMANCE FROM ACCLAIMED SINGER-SONGWRITER LUCINDA WILLIAMS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) IS THERE THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT BEAUTIFUL SOUND, THE SOUND I LOVE HEARING EVERY NIGHT, THAT IS JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. SAY HI, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ♪ I DIDN'T KNOW THE CAMERA WAS ON ME ♪ THEY'RE ABOUT TO MAKE THIS SHOW GLOW, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: IN AUSTRALIA, NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS OF LIQUID METHAMPHETAMINES WERE FOUND BEING SMUGGLED IN LADIES' UNDERGARMENTS. IT'S ALL IN THE HOT NEW SERIES, "BREAKING BRA." >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES EVA LONGORIA. ABBI JACOBSON AND ILANA GLAZER. AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY LUCINDA WILLIAMS. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( APPLAUSE ) EXCUSE ME. PLEASE, SIT DOWN, EVERYBODY. I'M USING THIS BECAUSE-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- I WAS TOLD BY MY WARDROBE MITT RESTO DE-TRUMP MYSELF. SOME OF THE TRUMP PHONE GOT ON ME AND I THINK I BREATHED IT IN. HEY, YOU GUYS WATCH THE GRAMMYS LAST NIGHT? >> Jon: YEAH, WE WERE CHECKING IT OUT. >> Stephen: I DON'T WANT TO BRAG HERE BUT IT IS THE TRUTH. I WAS ON THE GRAMMYS LAST NIGHT INTRODUCING MY GOOD FRIENDS IN THE CAST OF "HAMILTON," WHICH AT THIS POINT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET TICKETS TO "HAMILTON." BUT CONGRATS TO THEM ON THEIR WIN, AS WELL AS FRIEND OF THE SHOW KENDRICK LAMAR, WHO SWEPT THE RAP CATEGORIES. AND CONGRATS ALSO TO MY SOON-TO-BE FRIEND TAYLOR SWIFT ON HER SECOND ALBUM OF THE YEAR WIN. EVERYONE WAS THERE AT THE CEREMONIES LAST NIGHT WITH ONE BIG EXCEPTION. KANYE WEST WAS A NO-SHOW AT THE CEREMONY AFTER THREATENING TO BOYCOTT THE GRAMMY AWARDS UNLESS HE WON ALBUM OF THE YEAR, DESPITE NOT BEING NOMINATED. FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SAME REASON HE REFUSES TO ATTEND THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW. BUT LOOK AT THAT SILKY COAT. BUT KANYE'S ABSENCE WAS FELT, BECAUSE THE ACTUAL ALBUM OF THE YEAR WINNER TAY-TAY-- HAD SOME HARSH WORDS FOR YEEZY AFTERHE RAPPED IN HIS NEW SONG "FAMOUS." " I FEEL LIKE ME AND TAYLOR MIGHT STILL HAVE SEX. WHY? I MADE THAT "B" FAMOUS." KANYE, I HAVE A FEELING THE ODDS OF YOU HAVING SEX WITH TAYLOR SWIFT ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS WINNING A GRAMMY YOU WEREN'T NOMINATED FOR. HANDSOME COUPLE, THOUGH. AND TAY-TAY MADE THAT CLEAR IN HER ACCEPTANCE SPEECH. >> THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY WHO WILL TRY TO UNDERCUT YOUR SUCCESS OR TAKE CREDIT FOR YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR YOUR FAME. YOU WILL LOOK AROUND, AND YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT WAS YOU AND THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU WHO PUT YOU THERE. >> Stephen: NOTICE THAT SHE DIDN'T MENTION KANYE BY NAME BECAUSE, LIKE CANDYMAN, IF YOU SAY HIS NAME OUT LOUD ON A STAGE, HE WILL SUDDENLY APPEAR AND KILL YOUR JOY. ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) BUT KANYE'S GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN GRAMMYS HE WASN'T NOMINATED FOR BECAUSE THE RAPPER/MOGUL/VISIONARY TODDLE ( LAUGHTER ) TOOK TO TWITTER TO ANNOUNCE TO HIS FOLLOWERS, "I WRITE THIS TO YOU, MY BROTHERS, WHILE STILL $53 MILLION IN PERSONAL DEBT. PLEASE PRAY WE OVERCOME." YES, YEEZY OWES FIFTY-THREEZY MILLION DEEZIES. BUT HE SHALL OVERCOME. AFTER ALL, I BELIEVE IT WAS MARTIN LUTHER KING WHO SAID, "PLEASE GIVE ME $53 MILLION." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) JUST AS TRUE TODAY. JUST AS TRUE TODAY. BUT KANYE'S GOT A PLAN TO GET EVERYTHING BACK ON TRACK, BECAUSE AFTER TWEETING THAT HE WAS $53 MILLION IN DEBT, HE TWEETED, "MARK ZUCKERBERG INVEST $1 BILLION INTO KANYE WEST IDEAS." BRILLIANT! I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO REACH OUT TO THE FOUNDER OF FACEBOOK THAN THE ONE PLACE HE'S SURE TO LOOK. TWITTER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) YEAH. MAKES SENSE. THE TWEET-A-THON KEPT GOING FROM THERE, WITH KANYE PLEADING, "I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO CREATE WHAT I REALLY CAN." "MARK, I AM PUBLICLY ASKING YOU FOR HELP," AND "HEY, GOOGLE'S LARRY PAGE, I'M DOWN FOR YOUR HELP, TOO." SEE? KANYE'S NOT PROUD. HE'LL ACCEPT A BILLION DOLLARS FROM ANYONE. AND KANYE HAS A PLAN FOR THE CASH. HE TWEETED OUT THIS-- DO I HAVE IT HERE? YES. THIS ACTUAL ORG CHART FOR HIS CREATIVE COMPANY, DONDA, TO SHOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING. AND IT'S AS AMBITIOUS AS IT IS VAGUE, WITH CATEGORIES LIKE "HOME," WHICH PROMISES VISIONARY INNOVATIONS IN HOLOGRAMS, HOVERCRAFTS, AND SOMETHING CALLED A   "7-SCREEN MOVIE" EXPERIENCE, WHICH WILL FINALLY ALLOW ME TO WATCH ALL SEVEN "FAST AND FURIOUS" MOVIES AT THE SAME TIME. DOESN'T HURT THE PLOT. DOESN'T-- WHOA. YEAH! AND KANYE HAS COME UP WITH A TECH BREAKTHROUGH THE WORLD CAN'T WAIT FOR: EMOTICON AUTO CORRECT. I ACTUALLY NEED THIS. LONG-IME FANS OF MY FACE KNOW I WEAR GLASSES, AND THE WORSE MY EYESIGHT GETS, THE HARDER IT IS TO TELL THOSE LITTLE EMOJIS APART. SO FOR SEVERAL MONTHS-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- WHENEVER SOMEONE TEXTED ME SOME BAD NEWS, INSTEAD OF SENDING THE CRYING EMOJI, I WOULD ACCIDENTALLY SEND THE "LAUGHING SO HARD THAT I'M CRYING" EMOJI. THIS IS TRUE. THIS HAPPENED. UNTIL IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME WHAT I WAS DOING. SO I JUST WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO SAY TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS WHOSE PETS DIED OR WHO ARE GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE, YOUR TRAGEDY IS NOT HILARIOUS TO ME. AND I LOVE THIS ORG CHART. IT'S LIKE AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD IMAGINING THEIR DREAM TREEHOUSE. JSUT THINK ABOUT THE IDEAS KANYE COULDN'T FIT. INVISIBLE UNICYCLES? SHARKS THAT PLAY BASKETBALL? HE GAVE US A CLUE ON TWITTER WHEN HE SAID "IMA FIX WOLVES." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) NOW, THIS MIGHT BE ABOUT HIS NEW SONG "WOLVES," BUT WE CAN'T RULE OUT THAT HE'S ACTUALLY UPGRADING WOLVES, POSSIBLY BY GIVING THEM WINGS AND A DIAMOND-ENCRUSTED HEAD. THE POINT IS, KANYE NEEDS A BILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE ALL OF THIS A REALITY. AND YOU TECH BILLIONAIRES HAVE MADE FORTUNES OFF IDEAS THAT KANYE WEST COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF EVENTUALLY. I MEAN, ELON MUSK, YOU KNOW KANYE WOULD'VE COME UP WITH TESLA. IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE ORG CHART. "CARS." BOOM. SO, BILLIONAIRES, IT'S TIME TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE LITTLE GUY. AFTER ALL, AS KANYE ACTUAL HE TWEETED: "YOU'D RATHER OPEN UP ONE SCHOOL IN AFRICA LIKE YOU REALLY HELPED THE COUNTRY." "IF YOU WANT TO HELP, HELP ME." SO LET'S STOP SELFISHLY HELPING THE COUNTRY OF AFRICA AND START HELPING KANYE WEST. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ONE OF HIS COOL NEW WOLVES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH EVA LONGORIA. ( APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR, PRODUCER, AND POLITICAL ACTIVIST WHO IS CURRENTLY STARRING IN THE COMEDY SERIES "TELENOVELA". >> THE SEX TALK? >> HE'S SO YOUNG AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT HIS FATHER WOULD DO IT. >> HIS DAD IS IN PRISON SO WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THE SEX TALK WILL INCLUDE AT THIS POINT? I CAN HELP. I WAS A PEER COUNSELOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. "B" IS FOR BOOBS. "C" IS FOR... IS THERE PLEASE WELCOME EVA LONGORIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: LOVELY. >> HI!

TOTALLY UNEXPECTED BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONNECTION WITH ME AND DUBAI. SO HE SURPRISED ME. >> Stephen: YOU KNOW, YOU ACTUALLY ARE PRETTY BIG ON SOCIAL MEDIA. YOU HAVE TAKEN TO SOCIAL MEDIA MANY TIMES TO PUT ASIDE THE PERSISTENT RUMORS THAT YOU ARE PREGNANT. >> YES, YES. >> Stephen: ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL US TONIGHT? >> I ATE A HAMBURGER. IT'S ALWAYS LIKE -- >> IS THAT WHY YOU'RE GLOWING. >> IT'S ALWAYS AFTER I EAT A BIG MEAL. >> Stephen: AND PEOPLE THINK IT'S A BABY BUMP. >> I LOVE SOCIAL MEDIA. BEFORE-- I'M 40 SO, LIKE, BACK IN THE DAY, WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE IT, YOU REALLY COULDN'T REBUKE ANYTHING. YOU COULDN'T SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. >> Stephen: BUT NOT AS MANY PEOPLE COULD ATTACK YOU AT ONCE. >> THIS IS TRUE, BY THE WAY. YES! THAT'S THE SADDEST PART IS IT'S GOT TONE A NEGATIVE PLACE. IF ANYBODY POSTS ANYTHING NEGATIVE OF ME, YOU'RE BLOCKED. I MUTE YOU. YOU'RE ERASED FROM MY WORLD. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER ASKED ANYONE FOR $1 BILLION? THAT'S A THING NOW. THAT'S A THING NOW. >> I KNOW. YOU CAN ASK FOR MONEY. NO, I HAVE NOT. >> Stephen: I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONE-- WHAT'S HIS NAME. >> PEPE. >> Stephen: THAT YOU HAVE A VERY COMPETITIVE VALENTINE'S DAY. >> OH, YES, YES. EVERY VALENTINE'S WE DO COUPLES WAR. >> Stephen: WHAT IS THAT-- >> IT'S A WAR OF COUPLES. >> Stephen: LIKE, "I LOVE YOU MORE!" >> NO, NO, WE DO GAMES FOR POINTS. SO WE HAVE DIFFERENT CATEGORYS. WE HAVE, LIKE, THE NEWLYWED GAME, AND WE HAVE SPORTS CATEGORY WHERE YOU HAVE TO PLAY SOME SPORTS. THEN WE HAVE MINUTE TO WIN IT GAMES, WHICH ARE THESE STUPID, NO-TALENT-NEEDED GAMES GLI DON'T LOVE MY WIFE ENOUGH. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU COULD TURN IT INTO A CONTEST. >> I SAID WE ARE HOSTING. WE SHOULDN'T WIN. THAT WOULD BE SO DISTASTEFUL. AND WE GOT LAST PLACE.

IT WENT SO FAST. >> Stephen: IT'S ABOUT A SPANISH LANGUAGE SOAP OPERA BUT IT ITSELF IS NOT SPAN IRISH. >> Stephen: IS IT A TELE-COMMEDIA. WHO TO YOU PLAY? >> IT'S LIKE "30 ROCK" OR ONE OF THOSE SHOWS, WHERE IT'S BEHIND SCENES OF A SOAP OPERA. I PLAY A STAR OF THE SPANISH SOAP. >> Stephen: I WOULD HOPE SO. >> WHO DOESN'T SPEAK SPANISH. >> Stephen: SHE DOESN'T SPEAK SPANISH? >> NO. >> Stephen: DOES SHE HAVE TO PRETEND SHE CAN SPEAK SPANISH? >> SHE HAS THE THING IN HER EAR. >> Stephen: LITERALLY PEOPLE ARE SAYING. >> AND SHE REPEAT IT. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S SAYING. >> Stephen: DO YOU SPEAK SPANISH GIDO NOW, BUT I DIDN'T EYE GREW UP IN TEXAS. >> Stephen: YES. >> OOOH! TEXAS!
