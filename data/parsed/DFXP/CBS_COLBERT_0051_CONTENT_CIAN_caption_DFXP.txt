BUT IF NEE-NEE ASKS, HE WAS NOT HERE, AND I ONLY DIDN'T INVITE HER BECAUSE I THOUGHT KENDRA MIGHT COME, AND I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR THAT DRAMA. THEN I'LL BE TALKING WITH LEGENDARY SINGER-SONGWRITER CARLY SIMON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MOCK-ING-BIRD. CARLY'S GOT A NEW MEMOIR, AND SHE'S SO VAIN I BET SHE THINKS THAT BOOK IS ABOUT HER.

BECAUSE WE'RE JUST TWO DAYS FROM THANKS AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME TO MENTION SOMETHING I'M THANKFUL FOR-- DONALD TRUMP. BECAUSE HE GIVES ALL OF US ON TV SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. HE'S ALL OVER THE NEWSCASTS, HE WAS ON "S.N.L.." AND IF YOU TURN ON THE TV RIGHT NOW, THERE'S SOME GUY TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT NOW TRUMP IS GETTING A LOT OF HEAT FOR SOMETHING HE SAID ABOUT MUSLIM-AMERICANS' REACTION TO THE ATTACKS ON 9-11. >> HEY, I WATCHED WHEN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CAME TUMBLING DOWN. AND I WATCHED IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY, WHERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE CHEERING AS THAT BUILDING WAS COMING DOWN. >> YOU KNOW, THE POLICE SAY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND ALL THOSE RUMORS HAVE BEEN ON THE INTERNET FOR SOME TIME. SO DID YOU MISSPEAK? >> IT DID HAPPEN. I SAW IT. THERE WERE PEOPLE OVER IN NEW JERSEY THAT WERE WATCHING IT, A HEAVY ARAB POPULATION, THAT WERE CHEERING AS THE BUILDINGS CAME DOWN. NOT GOOD. >> Stephen: NO, NOT GOOD. ALSO NOT TRUE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) BUT IF IT WAS, HE WAS APPARENTLY THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER SAW IT BECAUSE "THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THE ALLEGED CELEBRATION EVER TOOK PLACE," AND I HAD MY CRACK FOOTAGE TEAM LOOK FOR IT. NOTHING. I GOTTA TELL YOU, MY GUYS ARE THE BEST. ANYTHING I NAME, THEY CAN FIND IT INSTANTLY. HERE'S A CHALLENGE: CAN YOU GUYS FIND A WOMAN GIVING A PSYCHIC READING TO A POSSUM? >> YES. BOOM! TWO POSSUMS! AND YET, TRUMP CLAIMS HE SAW IT. AND HE HAS EVIDENCE. >> DONALD TRUMP WILL BE SPEAKING HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. HE CALLED ME LATE TODAY TO ONCE AGAIN DEFEND HIS CLAIMS, TELLING ME THAT ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T REMEMBER WHERE EXACTLY HE SAW THAT VIDEO, HE DOES KNOW HE SAW IT BECAUSE HE HAS "THE WORLD'S GREATEST MEMORY." ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. HE CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE HE SAW THAT VIDEO, BUT HE CAN REMEMBER THAT HE HAS THE WORLD'S GREATEST MEMORY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) AND TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE JUST A PERFECT MEMORY OF THE PAST. WHEN IT COMES TO THE TERROR THREATS FACING OUR COUNTRY, HE CAN ALSO SEE INTO THE FUTURE. >> I WROTE A BOOK IN 2000, AND IN THE BOOK I MENTIONED OSAMA BIN LADEN. I SAID, "BAD GUY, HE IS GOING TO DO DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY, AND WE BETTER DO SOMETHING TO STOP HIM." I SAID, "OSAMA BIN LADEN'S GOING TO TRY TO COME IN AND DO SOME BIG DAMAGE." DON'T FORGET, IN MY BOOK, WRITTEN IN 2000, I WAS THE ONE THAT PREDICTED OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS TROUBLE. IF YOU READ THE BOOK, IT SAYS OSAMA BIN LADEN! >> Stephen: YES, TRUMP PREDICTED THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS THREATENING AMERICA "ALL THE WAY BACK" IN THE YEAR 2000-- THE SAME YEAR BIN LADEN WAS LINKED TO THE BOMBING OF THE U.S.S. "COLE" AND ONLY TWO YEARS AFTER BIN LADEN WAS INDICTED FOR THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN TANZANIA AND KENYA, AND ONLY SEVEN YEARS AFTER BIN LADEN WAS IMPLICATED IN THE 1993 WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING. THAT'S SPOOKY. IT'S LIKE TRUMP HAS SOME KIND OF FIFTH SENSE THAT LET'S HIM SEE WHAT'S IN NEWSPAPERS AND ON TVs. WOOO-OOO. AND NOSTRADONALD'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS POWER. TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WILL ATTEMPT TO PREDICT... THE PREDICTABLE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WILL NOW COMMUNE WITH THE OCCULT POWERS SO THAT I MAY KNOW THE KNOWN!

( LAUGHTER ) THE NEW FILM IS CALLED "CHI-RAQ." WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF CHICAGO AND IRAQ. >> YES. >> Stephen: WHY THAT COMBO? >> WELL, YOU HAVE TO ASK-- I MEAN, REALLY, I DID NOT COME UP WITH THAT NAME. LOCAL CHICAGO RAPPERS CAME UP WITH THAT NAME WHO FELT THAT-- NOT ALL CHICAGO-- BUT THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO IS A WAR ZONE, AND SO THEY FEEL-- PROBABLY EVEN TODAY-- THAT IT'S SAFER IN IRAQ THAN IT IS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO. >> Stephen: WELL, THE STATS ON THAT ARE SINCE 2001, MORE AMERICANS HAVE DIED IN CHICAGO THAN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN COMBINED. >> RIGHT. >> Stephen: OKAY WHAT, IS THE ROOT OF THIS VIOLENCE? WHAT IS CAUSING IT? >> WELL, IT'S MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. I THINK ONE THING I REALLY HOPE PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE FILM WHEN THEY SEE IT IS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TAKE AWAY ANYBODY'S SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE CAN DO. TOUGHER BACKGROUND CHECKS. WE CAN TITLE GUNS LIKE CARS. I MEAN, CHICAGO IS A VERY, VERY TIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. AND I WOULD SAY MANY PEOPLE-- MEMBERS OF THE N.R.A., AGREE WITH THIS STUFF.

WHAT'S HAPPENING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES TODAY-- YOU KNOW, WITH WHAT HAPPENED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI WHERE THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS GOT TOGETHER AND SAID UNLESS THE PRESIDENT RESIGNS, THEY WEREN'T GOING TO PLAY, I THINK A SEX STRIKE COULD REALLY WORK ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES WHERE THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DATE UPON RAPE, A COLLEGE CAMPUS, I THINK THAT WILL WORK.

SOME PEOPLE WERE AGAINST THIS VIDEO BEING RELEASED, THE DASH-CAM VIDEO, IT'S BEING RELEASED TODAY. DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO SEE THE EVENT EVEN IF CAN INCITE A VIOLENT REACTION BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS VIDEO BEING RELEASED. >> RIGHT. I THINK THAT, NUMBER ONE, THEY'RE WORRIED BECAUSE THEY THINK BLACK FOLKS OF CHICAGO ARE GOING TO RUN AMOK, AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S NECESSARILY SO. I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF HAVING PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION WITHOUT TEARING STUFF UP. THAT'S WHAT I FEEL. >> AND GOT THAT FROM FATHER FLAGGER IN CHICAGO. >> Stephen: I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. I HOPE IT IS PEACEFUL. >> I AM HOPEFUL THAT NOTHING CRAZY HAPPENS BUT I'M GLAD THE TAPE IS BEING RELEASED BECAUSE THIS IS DEMOCRACY, AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT AMERICA SHOULD SEE. >> Stephen: I NOTICE AROUND YOUR NECK-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU'VE GOT A CROSS. >> YES. >> Stephen: I NOTICED AROUND YOUR NECK YOU'VE GOT A CROSS, AND YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER SYMBOL.
