 Captioning sponsored by CBS (  BAND PLAYING  "LATE SHOW" THEME  ) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> STEPHEN: HEY EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW", I'M -- THANKS, EVERYBODY! HI, PAUL, HOW ARE YA? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." I'M MISTER COLBERT, BUT I'M A COOL HOST, SO YOU KIDS CAN CALL ME STEPHEN. AND I HOPE YOU'RE ALL SITTING DOWN BECAUSE J.K. ROWLING HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE A NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK... ISH. IT'S NOT A BOOK. IT'S THE SCRIPT OF THE UPCOMING PLAY, "HARRY POTTER AND THE CURSED CHILD." AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING, BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT HARRY'S FRIENDSHIP WITH MCCAULAY CULKIN. THE PLAY ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE 19 YEARS AFTER THE LAST BOOK, AND FEATURES A THIRTY-SOMETHING HARRY BALANCING HIS JOB AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC WITH BEING A FATHER. THAT JUST SOUNDS DEPRESSING. I LOVE WE'LL GET SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THAT WHOLE WORLD, BUT HARRY POTTER'S LIFE PEAKED WHEN HE WAS 17. CAPTAIN OF THE QUIDDITCH TEAM, BIG "CHOSEN ONE" ON CAMPUS. NOW HE'S JUST SOME ... GUY! WHO ARE HIS ENEMIES EVEN GOING TO BE? PHIL FROM ACCOUNTING? SLOWING METABOLISM? A VAGUE RESTLESS FEELING WHEN HE LOOKS AT TRAVEL POSTERS? YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT "HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S PROSTATE." SO, PLEASE, SPARE US. AND THIS GOES FOR ALL BELOVED CHILDHOOD STORIES. I CAN'T TAKE READING ABOUT A GROWN-UP HOLDEN CAULFIELD ASSISTANT-MANAGING A COSTCO. I DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT THE NARNIA KIDS' UNFULFILLING MARRIAGES. "I USED TO BE A KING, BRENDA! A KING!" AND NO ONE, WANTS TO SEE "ARE YOU THERE, GOD? IT'S ME, MARGARET" GO THROUGH MENOPAUSE. BUT ONE THING I DO WANT YOU TO IMAGINE IS TONIGHT'S SHOW BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A HOT ONE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT TRANSITION WAS ALMOST TOO SMOOTH. (LAUGHTER) FIRST, I'LL BE TALKING WITH EMMY-AWARD WINNING ACTOR KELSEY GRAMMER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE'S STARRING IN BROADWAY'S "FINDING NEVERLAND " AS CAPTAIN HOOK. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP HIM? DOORKNOBS. (LAUGHTER) >> HE CAN'T GET TO THE DOOR! TRIED TO GET IT, CAN'T GET IT. >> Stephen: ALSO CROCODILES. THEN, FROM "PORTLANDIA," I'LL BE TALKING TO FRED ARMISEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LITTLE KNOWN FACT: THE SCRIPT OF EVERY EPISODE OF "PORTLANDIA" IS HAND-SCRIMSHAWED ONTO A VINTAGE BOWLING PIN. THEN I'LL BE TALKING TO THE COVER MODEL FOR THE FIRST ISSUE OF PLAYBOY MAGAZINE WITHOUT NUDITY, SARAH MCDANIEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TONIGHT, I'LL FOLLOW HER LEAD AND DO THE WHOLE SHOW WITH MY PANTS ON. AND WE'LL HEAR MUSIC FROM TY SEGALL AND THE MUGGERS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE SULTRY SOUND OF JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. GREET THEM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪ THEY'RE ABOUT TO KICK OUT THE JAMS, BUT BEFORE THEY DO, ONE MORE THING: A REPORT BY THE GUARDIAN FOUND THAT REMOVING THE FACEBOOK APP FROM YOUR IPHONE CAN SAVE UP TO 15% OF BATTERY LIFE.

AND A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY TY TSEGALL AND THE MUGGERS! FEATURING JON BATISTE AND "STAY HUMAN"! ♪ ♪ AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BACK AT CHA! THANKS, EVERYBODY! CAN WE SHOW THE DOME TO EVERYBODY AT HOME? WE'VE GOT LITTLE HEARTS ON THE DOME TONIGHT. ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? THAT IS JUST A LITTLE FRIENDLY REMINDER TO EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO MAY NOT HAVE MARKED IT ON YOUR CALENDAR THAT SUNDAY IS VALENTINE'S DAY. SOMETIMES YOU FORGET, BUT IT'S A BIG DAY, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR ROMANTIC STATUS IS, SINGLE OR MARRIED, JUST STARTED DATING, SPINSTER WHO GAZES OUT LONGINGLY FROM THE TOP OF HER LIGHTHOUSE. I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO DO ON VALENTINE'S DAY, BECAUSE I'M HAPPILY MARRIED. AND THIS YEAR, MY WIFE AND I ARE ACTUALLY SPENDING THE DAY APART. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO GET HER, SHE'S WITH HER FAMILY, I'M GOING TO BE WITH MY BOYS SKIING IN VERMONT. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO GET HER, SO I GOT HER A MENTION AT THE TOP OF MY SHOW. HAPPY VALENTINE'S, HONEY. AND, IN RETURN, MY WIFE HAS GIVEN ME SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT FOR THE LAST MINUTE. THE NICE THING IS THAT I THINK KEEPING IT LOW KEY AS A MARRIED COUPLE IS KIND OF COOL. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED A BIG THING ON VALENTINE'S DAY. THE RING AND THE WEDDING WERE THE ULTIMATE VALENTINE. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE. WE KNOW WE LOVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> Stephen: IF YOU GET A REALLY GREAT VALENTINE FROM SOMEBODY YOU'RE MARRIED TO, IT'S LIKE, WHAT'S WRONG? (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE HOW MY PRODUCER PAUL DINELLO AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER TWENTY YEARS, SO WE DON'T SHAKE HANDS. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER 28 YEARS. I WAS TESTING YOU. ONE OF US CARES MORE THAN THE OTHER. WE DON'T SHAKE HANDS, RIGHT, PAUL? >> NEVER. >> Stephen: IT WAS YOUR IDEA. TELL THE PEOPLE WHY? >> IT'S TOO FORMAL. IT WOULD BE WEIRD, LIKE ME EXCHANGING BUSINESS CARDS WITH MY MOM. >> Stephen: LIKE INVITING YOUR MOM TO JOIN YOU ON LinkedIn. >> I WANT TO NETWORK WITH YOU, MOM! >> Stephen: WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON VALENTINE'S DAY? >> MOSTLY TRAVELING. WE'RE GOING TO DO TO DISNEY. >> Stephen: YOU'RE TAKING THE TRUCKSSTER DOWN TO WALLY WORLD? >> I AM. >> Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO BE GETTING ANYTHING FOR YOUR WIFE? >> NO, I -- >> Stephen: YOU'RE RECENTLY MARRIED. I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ALMOST 25 YEARS. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN MARRIED? >> FOUR YEARS. >> Stephen: TWO CHILDREN, NICE GROUPING. YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD GET YOUR WIFE SOMETHING OR YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. >> YEAH, BUT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME. >> Stephen: WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME? >> I MEAN, BECAUSE I'M -- UM -- HERE. >> Stephen: JUST RUN TO THE DRUGSTORE AND BUY THE FIRST TWO THINGS YOU SEE THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED GIFTS. >> LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES AND A JUG OF TIDE? >> STEPHEN: SHE'LL LOVE IT. AS LONG AS YOU INCLUDE THE RIGHT VALENTINE'S DAY CARD. IT SEALS THE DEAL. >> SENATOR. >> Stephen: YEAH. IN FACT, THE REASON PAUL IS OUT HERE, DO YOU HAVE THE CARD? >> YES. >> Stephen: THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT VALENTINES CARDS OUT THERE. BUT THEY DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY, AS WE'LL LEARN IN MY NEW SEGMENT: "FIRST DRAFTS!" ♪ >> NO, NO! STUPID! STUPID! >> Stephen: AS ALWAYS, FIRST DRAFTS IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE GOOD FOLKS AT WITE OUT. "WITE OUT: DOES THAT STUFF EVEN EXIST ANYMORE?" PAUL, DO YOU HAVE THE CARDS? >> HERE YOU GO. >> STEPHEN: OKAY, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST DRAFTS OF SOME OF AMERICA'S TOP VALENTINES. THIS CARD HAS A BUTTERFLY AND SAYS "YOU MAKE MY HEART FLUTTER." VERY SWEET, BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID: "LET'S BE FRIENDS UNTIL YOU CHANGE INTO SOMETHING PRETTIER." (LAUGHTER) IT'S HONEST. >> IT'S HONEST. >> Stephen: SO I LIKE THIS ONE. THIS ONE HAS A PICTURE OF A LITTLE OWL WITH THE CAPTION: "YOU'RE A HOOT." >> YEAH. SWEET, FOR A FUNNY GIRL. >> Stephen: BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID -- "YOU'RE AN OWL." NOT POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IT IS JUST WHAT IT IS. >> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET HER ANYTHING? >> WELL NOW I HAVE TO! >> Stephen: FOLKS IF YOU'RE A "STAR WARS" FAN, HERE'S ONE WITH R2-D2 AND C-3PO THAT SAYS "YOU R2 GOOD TO ME." BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID: "WILL YOU C-3P-GO OUT WITH ME EVEN THOUGH I LIVE IN MY PARENTS' BASEMENT AND COSPLAY AS A WOOKIE?" I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CARDS, ACTUALLY. THIS IMPLIES THAT CP3O AND COSPLAY ARE ROMANTIC. >> THEY DO HANG OUT WITH EACH OTHER. >> Stephen: R2D2 LOOKS LIKE A MARITAL AID. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S ONE WITH SHEEP THAT READS. "I LOVE EWE". BUT IT THE FIRST DRAFT ACTUALLY. SAID: "I WANT TO MAKE A SWEATER OUT OF YOUR BODY HAIR." (LAUGHTER) I LIKE THIS. >> THIS WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. >> Stephen: IT WOULD LOOK JUNKY IF THEY WERE THERE. EVERYONE WOULD GO, WHAT'S IN THE PILE? OKAY. THIS ONE'S CUTE. IT HAS A LITTLE SLICE OF PIZZA AND SAYS: "YOU STOLE A PIZZA MY HEART." THE FIRST DRAFT SAID, "I'M MOZZA-REALLY PEPPER-LONELY!" KIND OF SAD, ACTUALLY. AND FINALLY, HERE'S ONE WITH A TRAIN THAT SAYS "ALL ABOARD MY HEART." ALL RIGHT? BUT THE FIRST DRAFT SAID:  "I'M STEAMIN' TOWARD YOUR TUNNEL. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT CABOOSE PLAY?" (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELL, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, PAUL. >> HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY TO YOU. >> Stephen: I GOT YOU SOME CARDS. >> THANK YOU. >> Stephen: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH KELSEY GRAMMER! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) >> STEPHEN: WELCOME BACK. FOR OVER 20 YEARS, MY FIRST GUEST PLAYED ONE OF TELEVISION'S MOST ENDEARING CHARACTERS, DR. FRASIER CRAINE. NOW YOU CAN SEE HIM IN A LIMITED ENGAGEMENT ON BROADWAY IN THE MUSICAL "FINDING NEVERLAND". ♪ ♪ >> STEPHEN: PLEASE WELCOME KELSEY GRAMMER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ THERE IS THE PLAY BILL RIGHT THERE, "FINDING NEVERLAND." YOU PLAY HOOK HIMSELF, ANOTHER HIGH-STATUS CHARACTER. >> RECOGNIZABLE. >> Stephen: BUT ALSO HE'S THE CAPTAIN. >> HE IS THE CAPTAIN. IN THIS CASE, HE'S ACTUALLY THE ALTER EGO OF JAMES BARRY WHO'S HAVING WRITER'S BLOCK AND HE SAYS YOU CAN EITHER FIGHT AND WRITE THE STORY YOU WANT TO WRITE OR YOU CAN JUST DISAPPEAR. SO HE'S REALLY SORT OF THE ARTIST'S CONSCIOUSNESS IN THIS PLAY. >> Stephen: YOU THINK ACTORS THEMSELVES ARE A PETER PAN IN A WAY? >> OH, YEAH, SURE. >> Stephen: PERFORMERS DON'T WANT TO GROW UP. >> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GROW UP. AS AN ACTOR, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHILD, LIKE, WAY OF GOING ABOUT THE WORK. IT HAS TO BE ON AN INNOCENT LEVEL TO DO IT WELL. >> Stephen: HOW LONG WILL YOU BE PLAYING CAPTAIN HOOK? >> I'M FINISHED SUNDAY AND COME BACK MID MARCH TWO MORE WEEKS. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A SINGER? >> AS A KID, A GUY CAME TO SCHOOL AND SAID I WANT ALL THE BOYS IN THE CLASS TO COME OUT FOR CHOIR. ALL THE BOYS SAID NO WAY, AND WE DID IT ANYWAY. MY JUNIOR YEAR, I FINALLY DID A PLAY. AND I THOUGHT, OH, I CAN -- >> Stephen: DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR FIRST PLAY WAS? >> YEAH, "LITTLE FOXES." >> Stephen: WERE YOU BIT RIGHT AWAY. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: "MY SISTER EILEEN" IS WHAT WE DID FIRST. >> HOW DID YOU DO THE JON STEWART SHOW? >> Stephen: I WORKED FOR "THE DAILY SHOW" BEFORE. I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB. MY AGENT SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ON THAT SHOW? I SAID, NOT PARTICULARLY. I SAID, I HAVE TWO KIDS. I WENT OVER AND TURNED OUT, I LOVED IT. DID YOU EVER TAKE A JOB AND THINK, I'M NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS? >> WAITING TABLES. >> Stephen: DID YOU WAIT TABLES FOR A LONG TIME? >> ON 57th STREET AND 6t 6th AVENUE FOR A LONG TIME. >> Stephen: COULD YOU GET INTO THAT AND HANDLE IT? >> I WAS GOOD AT IT. I COULD WORK THREE DAYS A WEEK AND MAKE MORE MONEY THAN I COULD WHEN I WAS ABOUT 45. >> Stephen: AS A YOUNG STARTING ACTOR, I WOULD -- IF THEY HADN'T TOUCHED, LIKE, ONE OF THE FILETS -- >> OH, NO, YOU EAT. >> Stephen: YOU DEFINITELY EAT IT. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: YOU EAT THE BREAD -- >> IF THERE'S A BED OR A PARK, YOU TAKE THE BED. IF IT'S A NICE STEAK AND THEY DIDN'T EAT ALL OF IT -- >> Stephen: PROBABLY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO, RIGHT? BUT THE MANAGEMENT IS ALLOWED TO DO THAT. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: WE WOULD HIDE IT FROM OUR MANAGEMENT. >> MY FIRST JOB WHEN I WAS A KID WAS A DISHWASHER AT DENNYS. I LIED ABOUT MY AGE, I ADMIT IT. I WAS 14 AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 15 TO GET A SPECIAL PERMIT TO WORK. >> Stephen: DENNY'S IS VERY, VERY STRICT. (LAUGHTER) >> WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS I WAS WORKING THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT 11:00 TO 8:00 IN MORNING. THEY TOLD ME I COULD EAT ALL THE HOT FUDGE SUNDAYS I WANTED. SO, GREAT, IT'S, LIKE, MY FAVORITE FOOD. THIS MANAGER COMES TO ME, I'M BOOKING IT MAYBE A MONTH AND A HALF AND HE SAYS, WE'RE MISSING FILETS. I SAID, YOU THINK I'M TAKING THE FILETS? I GOT INDIGNANT FOR A 14-YEAR-OLD. HE SAID, DID YOU TAKE THEM? I SAID, NO, I'M EATING THE HOT FUDGE SUNDAYS. I LOVE THOSE. HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID, HOW OLD ARE YOU? I SAID, ALL RIGHT, I'M 14. I LIED ABOUT MY AGE! HE SAID, I'VE GOT TO LET YOU GO. >> Stephen: I LOVE THE IDEA OF KELSEY GRAMMER JUST HAWKING DOWN HOT FUDGE BECAUSE I THINK OF YOU AS A VERY RAREYFIED PALLET. IS THERE A REALLY LOW-RENT THING YOU ENJOY? WHAT DO YOU SNACK ON? >> WELL, IT'S A LITTLE ODD. I GUESS THINGS HAVE CHANGED A BIT. MY FAVORITE SNACK IS CAVIAR. (APPLAUSE) >> Stephen: YOU REALIZE THERE IS A CARICATURE OF YOURSELF RIGHT NOW (LAUGHTER) HALF A POTATO. >> UNSALTED POTATO CHIPS, A SQUEEZE OF LEMON, THAT'S IT. THE POOR MAN'S VERSION. >> Stephen: YOU'RE JUST JOE ET CETERA. >> I AM. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE THE COURAGE OF YOUR CONVICTIONS. YOU'RE CONSERVATIVE IN HOLLYWOOD AND ON BROADWAY. SOME CONSERVATIVES SAY, OH, I'VE GOT A COLD SHOULDER. IS IT A REAL THING? >> HONESTLY, IF YOU'RE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO EXIST. I'VE HAD PRETTY REASONABLE SUCCESS WITH MY CAREER. I THINK THERE IS A PREDILECTION TOWARDS, YOU KNOW, DISMISSING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T THINK THE WAY YOU DO. THAT'S COMMON GROUND, I GUESS, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT, NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN SHUNNED IN ANY WAY. ESPECIALLY ON BROADWAY. AND THE BROADWAY COMMUNITY REALLY KIND OF SEEMS PAST ALL THAT. TOLERANCE DOES EXIST ON BROADWAY. >> Stephen: IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE REPUBLICAN RACE YOU LIKE? AND I'LL TELL YOU IF THEY'VE DROPPED OUT. >> I HONESTLY LIKE BEN CARSON. >> Stephen: YOU LIKE HIM? YEAH. >> Stephen: DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. >> HE'S THE ONLY GUY WHO ISN'T REALLY PART OF THE DEAL. >> Stephen: WOULD YOU VOTE FOR BERNIE? >> PROBABLY NOT. I MIGHT SIT THAT ONE OUT. >> Stephen: HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF GETTING IN THERE YOURSELF? >> I'VE TOYED WITH IT. (LAUGHTER) >> Stephen: A THOUGHTFUL PERSON WOULD BE VERY WELCOMED. >> IT'S SOMETHING I'VE TOYED WITH IN THE PAST. I THINK YOU HAVE TO EITHER BE AN ACTOR OR A POLITICIAN AND SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE DOESN'T WORK. >> REAGAN MADE THE TURN. HE DID MAKE THE TURN, THOUGH, THAT'S THE THING. >> Stephen: YEAH. HE ACTUALLY HEAD OF THE SAG UNION FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THEN BECAME GOVERNOR AND THEN PRESIDENT. SO HIS COMMITMENT TO POLITICS WAS PRETTY MUCH WRITTEN IN STONE BY THEN. >> Stephen: KELSEY, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> YOU BET, MAN. >> Stephen: NICE MEETING YOU.

THERE YOU ARE. IS THIS YOU IN HIGH SCHOOL? >> YEAH, I WAS A TEENAGER. THAT WAS A CLASH SHIRT I WAS WEARING AND I WAS IN A PUNK BAND CALLED THE K.G.B. >> Stephen: WHAT YEAR ARE WE TALKING? >> '84. >> Stephen: THAT'S PERFECT FOR '84. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: HOW DID YOU MAKE THE TRANSITION TO COMEDY. >> I MADE A VIDEO IN 1998 AFTER SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST, I PLAYED A GERMAN GUY AND DEAF PERSON AND THAT TAPE JUST MADE THE ROUNDS. MORE PEOPLE CAME OUT FOR THAT THAN THEY EVER DID MY BAND. SO IT WAS A VERY QUICK -- IT WAS VERY EVIDENT TO ME THAT THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING. >> Stephen: I HAVE AN ODD QUESTION FOR YOU. >> YES. >> Stephen: I HAD A DESKTOP PICTURE ON MY COMPUTER FOR MANY YEARS IS THIS RIGHT HERE. AND THAT'S ME AND MY DAUGHTER AND TWO SONS SKATING AT THE ICE RINK BLIND THE ROSE PLANETARIUM HERE IN NEW YORK. THERE IS A GUY HERE. FOR YEARS I'VE ALWAYS IMAGINED THAT THAT'S YOU BECAUSE IF YOU BLOW UP AND GO IN REALLY CLOSE -- IS THAT YOU? DWROID EVER GO SKATING THERE? >> I JUST LIKE TO WATCH OVER YOU GUYS TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE PLAYING IT SAFE. I DON'T WANT YOU TO FALL WHEN YOU SKATE. >> Stephen: LITERALLY, THIS WAS ON MY DESK. I SAID, I THINK THAT'S FRED. >> FUNNY, THE ONE BEFORE IT, THAT'S THE WAY MY LEGS ARE. I AM A LITTLE PIGEON-TOED. IT'S SIMILAR. LOOK AT THAT. >> WOW. MAYBE IT WAS ME.

YOU KNOW THAT FEELING? >> Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LIKE -- >> LIKE A JACKET. >> Stephen: LIKE A NORTH FACE SORT OF THING? >> LIKE AN IN BETWEEN, LIKE A FALL JACKET.

PLEASE, JESUS, I'LL NOT DO THAT THING I DO ANYMORE IF YOU JUST PLEASE LET ME GET TO THE CORNER. >> WERE YOU THERE IN '96? >> Stephen: YES. THE WINTER WAS SO INCREDIBLE.
