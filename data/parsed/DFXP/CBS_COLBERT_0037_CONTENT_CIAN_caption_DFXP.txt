♪ ♪ ♪ (  BAND PLAYING INTRO MUSIC  ) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) >> Stephen: HEY! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"! THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, BABD. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. >> STEPHEN! STEPHEN! >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS, EVERYBODY. PLEASE! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW." QSH ARE WASHINGTON ARE WASHINGTON. >> WELCOME, EVERYBODY. YOU GET THE GREETINGS WHEN YOU COME OUT, AND YOU'RE ON THE TV, EVERYBODY THINKS YOU'RE A TV STAR AND DON'T DO YOUR OWN EXWROASRY SHOPPING, BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. I WAS AT THE GROCERY STORE JUST TODAY DOING AN EMERGENCY FOOD RUN. IT WAS 10:00 A.M., AND WE WERE OUT OF OREOS. SO I'M IN THE SUPERMARKET, AND I SEE ALL THE STANDARD VARIETIES OREOS ON THE SHELVES: ORIGINAL, CHOCOLATE CREAM, PEANUT BUTTER CREAM, GINGERBREAD, CANDY CORN, BLAZIN' JALAPENO, PINE FRESH. ALL OF THEM. IT'S TRUE. THEN I CAME ACROSS A KIND OF OREOS I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY'RE CALLED "OREO THINS." THEY'RE LIKE-- OKAY, ALL RIGHT. THEY'RE LIKE-- VERY DIVIDED ROOM ABOUT THE OREO THIN. ( LAUGHTER ) THEY'RE LIKE REGULAR OREOS BUT WITH THINNER COOKIES AND LESS CREAM. NOW OREO THIN SOUNDS-- LISTEN, LISTEN, WE HAVE TO LIVE TOGETHER AS A NATION. OREO THIN SOUNDS LIKE A DIET PRODUCT, BUT IT'S NOT. KINDA LIKE BACON BITS-- ALSO NOT A DIET PRODUCT-- AND IT TAKES FOREVER TO REASSEMBLE THEM INTO A STRIP. SO I WAS LOOKING AND I KIND OF HAD THE THE REACTION YOU DID. I SAID WHY ARE WE SUDDENLY CONFRONTED WITH THESE THINNER OREOS. WELL, DON'T WANT TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO, BUT I CALLED THIS A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN ROGUE COOKIE SCIENTISTS VIOLATED THE NATURAL ORDER AND CREATED THE DOUBLE- STUFFED OREO. ARE THEY GOOD? YES. YES, BUT WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE A PRICE TO PAY. BACK THEN EVERYONE WAS SAYING, "THE DOUBLE STUFF IS GREAT, CAUSE YOU CAN EAT HALF AS MANY." BUT DID YOU? NO. NO, YOU DID NOT. SO, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE ANSWER, TAKE A GOOD LOOK IN THE MIRROR, IF YOU CAN FIND ONE TO CONTAIN YOUR DOUBLE-STUFFED FACE. YOU'RE THE REASON WE HAVE DEPLETED AMERICA'S STRATEGIC RESERVE OF STUFF, AND NOW WE'RE STUCK WITH THE THINNER OREOS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR-- THIS IS NOT A PRODUCT PLACEMENT. OREO IS NOT GIVING ME ONE THIN DIME. OR TWO THIN DIMES WITH STUFF IN BETWEEN, WHICH, OBVIOUSLY, I WOULD ALSO EAT. BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO SHAKE THIS OFF, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A DELICIOUS, DOUBLE-STUFFED SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) FROM THE MOVIE EYE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL THEM. I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. YOU JUST TRUST THAT WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW. THAT'S THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE. I WILL TELL YOU WHO WE HAVE. FROM THE MOVIE "SPECTRE," I'LL BE TALKING TO JAMES BOND HIMSELF, DANIEL CRAIG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S ELECTRIC. I WILL PITCH HIM ON MY PREKEEL TO "DR. NO--" "MR. NO, MEDICAL STUDENT." I'M ALSO TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF "EAT, PRAY, LOVE," ELIZABETH GILBERT. GREAT BOOK, A LOT OF PEOPLE READ IT. PERSONALLY, I PRAY BEFORE I EAT, AND THEN I USUALLY NEED ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE I CAN LOVE. SAME RULES AS SWIMMING, BASICALLY. AND WE ALSO HAVE MATHEMATICIAN DR. EUGENIA CHENG.

TOMORROW NIGHT WHEN YOU TUNE IN AT 11:35 EASTERN, EXPECTING TO SEE MY SHOW DELAYED BY FOOTBALL, IT WILL NOT BE. WE'RE STARTING AT THE NORMAL TIME. SO IF I'M NOT ON YOUR TV SCREEN AT 11:35, PLEASE CALL THE COPS. SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME. BECAUSE STARTING TOMORROW, "THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL" WILL BE SEEN ONLY ON NFL NETWORK. AND THEY'RE KICKING OFF WITH A HECK OF A MATCHUP: THE CLEVELAND BROWNS VERSUS THE UNDEFEATED CINCINNATI BENGALS. IT'S THE BATTLE OF OHIO, SO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH IS GOING TO HAVE TO BET A SIGNATURE REGIONAL FOOD ITEM AGAINST HIMSELF. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A CLEVELAND POLISH BOY KIELBASA AGAINST CINCINNATI'S MOST FAMOUS DISH, SPAGHETTI COVERED WITH CHILI. AND, YES, THE AVERAGE LIFESPAN IN OHIO IS LIKE A FRUITFLY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY, ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I LIKE TO THANK THE NFL FOR BEING A AGREED LEAD-IN ALL YEAR. YOU GUYS GAVE IT 110%. YOU LEFT IT ALL OUT ON THE FIELD. RIGHT NOW, I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE I'M SMACKING YOUR ASS. BACK TO YOU, STEPHEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANKS, STEVE. NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. BUT INSTEAD, I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY, TRUMP RELEASED A NEW BOOK THAT PUTS HIS HIGH REGARD FOR THIS COUNTRY RIGHT IN THE TITLE, IT'S CALLED "CRIPPLED AMERICA." I KNOW, "CRIPPLED AMERICA" IS JUST A TERRIBLE PHRASE THAT SOUNDS DEEPLY OFFENSIVE. KIND OF LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, I'VE OPENED THE BOOK-- I'VE OPENED THE BOOK, MAINLY SO I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COVER ANYMORE. AND IT'S FULL OF THINGS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM TRUMP IN HIS SPEECHES, WITH LITTLE EXTRAS, LIKE PUNCTUATION. BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW IT'S WORTH PICKING UP AND THEN DOOK THIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) , OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP-- I CALL THAT MY HUMP DAY MEDICINE. ( LAUGHTER ) MMM. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE ONLY CANDIDATE OUT THERE WITH A BOOK. JEB! JUST RELEASED A BRAND NEW E-BOOK ENTITLED "REPLY ALL." IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SHOW YOU'RE DONE MAKING MISTAKES BY NAMING A BOOK AFTER SOMETHING PEOPLE DO BY ACCIDENT. AND JEB BUSH CLEARLY NEEDS SOME HELP BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE HIS CAMPAIGN IS SLEEPWALKING. WHICH, ADMITTEDLY, IS A STRATEGY THAT'S WORKING FOR BEN CARSON. ( APPLAUSE ) SO NOW, NOW, TEAM BUSH-- HUGE. BIG BEN CARSON FANS HERE TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) SO NOW TEAM BUSH IS SHAKING THINGS UP. >> STILL STRUGGLING IN THE POLLS, JEB BUSH ROLLED OUT A NEW SLOGAN MONDAY SAYING "JEB CAN FIX IT." >> Stephen: YES, "JEB CAN FIX IT." THAT IS REASSURING. JUST LIKE WHEN YOUR PILOT GETS ON AND SAYS: "THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING. JUST WANTED TO SAY I SWEAR I KNOW HOW TO LAND A PLANE. OKAY?" BUT NO MATTER HOW TOUGH IT GETS, DON'T COUNT JEB! OUT, BECAUSE AS HE EXPLAINED, HE'S A FIGHTER. >> JUST TALK ABOUT YOUR RESILIENCE, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO FIGHT. >> MAN, THEY DON'T KNOW ME. THEY DON'T KNOW ME. I EAT NAILS WHEN I WAKE UP, AND THEN I HAVE BREAKFAST. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: YES, YES. JEB EATS NAILS WHEN HE WAKES UP. AND I BELIEVE HIM. "AM I STILL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?" ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND JEB WASN'T DONE WITH THE TOUGH TALK IN THAT IT'S SORT OF TOUGH FOR HIM TO TALK. >> ARE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND'D UNDERESTIMATING YOUR WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT BACK? GII HOPE THEY ARE. THIS IS LIKE FOR ME, THE GREATER THE ADVERSITY-- FIRST OF ALL, IT MEANS I HAVE TO GET BETTER. I KNOW I HAVE TO GET BETTER. COME OI HAVE ENOUGH HUMILITY TO KNOW I GOTTA GET BETTER. >> Stephen: REALLY INSPIRES CONFIDENCE IN YOUR CANDIDATE. I CAN IMAGINE HIS ADDRESS TO CONGRESS. "THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS-- LOOK, IT'S, I KNOW IT'S GOTTA GET BETTER. I MEAN, COME ON. IT HAS TO, RIGHT? AND DON'T UNDERESTIMATE AMERICA. BUT I HOPE YOU DO, BECAUSE I ATE NAILS FOR BREAKFAST. GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS... YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT." ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, FOLKS, YOU CAN'T BE TOO MARRED ON BUSH BECAUSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ISN'T EASY. IT'S A BLOODY WINNER-TAKE-ALL COMPETITION THAT REMINDS ME OF THE HUNGER GAMES. NO, IT'S MORE THAN THAT. IT'S THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." WELCOME TO THE "HUNGRY FOR POWER GAMES." TRIBUTES, ASSEMBLE! ( CLAPS ) YES, OH, LOOK AT ALL OF THEM, STRONG, SLEEK. LIKE A PRIDE OF LIONS. A PACK OF JACKALS. A GAGGLE OF JOWLS. BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, CITIZENS WE LOST ANOTHER COMPETITOR THIS WEEK. JIM, WHICH BRAVE TRIBUTE HAS GONE TO THAT GREAT FUNDRAISER IN THE SKY? >> TODAY, THE FIELD OF DEMOCRATIC NOMINEES FOR PRESIDENT LOST ONE MORE CANDIDATE, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM CRUSADER LAWRENCE LESSIG. >> I MUST TODAY END MY CAMPAIGN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. >> Stephen: YES! WHO? ( LAUGHTER ) HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR LAWRENCE LESSIG DROPPED OUT? WHEN DID HE DROP IN? I'M SORRY. NO, NO, FORGET THIS. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. LET'S PUT THAT RIGHT BACK IN THE BOTTLE AND SAVE THAT FOR LATER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MOP THAT UP. MOP THAT UP. HERE'S THE THING. THIS GUY RAN FOR PRESIDENT ON THE SINGLE ISSUE OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM. HE WAS LASER-FOCUSED ON THIS ONE TOPIC. PROBABLY BECAUSE HE COULD ONLY SEE ONE THING THROUGH THOSE TINY GLASSES. BUT AS ALWAYS, LET US SALUTE THE FALLEN! ( CANNON BOOMS ) ( "HUNGER GAMES" "TRIBUTE" THEME PLAYS ) ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  ( CHEERS ) STICK AROUND, WE'VE GOT DANIEL CRAIG. ( BAND PLAYING ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD WE'RE TOGETHER AT WHAT IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR MANY PEOPLE, BECAUSE YESTERDAY WITHOUT WARNING, TWITTER GOT RID OF "FAVORITES" AND REPLACED IT WITH "LIKES." AND NOW, INSTEAD OF STARS, WE HAVE HEARTS. TWITTER USERS WERE HEARTBROKEN, OR AS I STILL THINK OF IT, STARBROKEN. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, TWITTER CLAIMS THEY MADE THE CHANGE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT "THE STAR COULD BE CONFUSING, ESPECIALLY TO NEWCOMERS." YES, THE CONCEPT THAT A GOLD STAR MEANS "GOOD" MIGHT INDEED CONFUSE NEWCOMERS... TO KINDERGARTEN. AND TWITTER FURTHER JUSTIFIED THIS ATROCITY BY SAYING, "YOU MIGHT LIKE A LOT OF THINGS, BUT NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE YOUR FAVORITE." YES, IT CAN! IT'S RAINDROPS ON ROSES AND WHISKERS ON KITTENS.

IS THIS GAY HEART," AND "I JUST WENT TO 'FAVORITE' A MAN'S TWEET AND FELT GAY DOING IT." ( LAUGHTER ) LISTEN, GUYS, I'M NO FAN OF THIS CHANGE EITHER. BUT "A," THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH PEOPLE BEING GAY, AND "B," IF GIVING ANOTHER MAN A HEART IS YOUR STANDARD FOR BEING GAY, YOU'RE WATCHING THE WRONG GAY PORN.

HOW MUCH BUTTER-- HOW MUCH-- HOW MUCH BUTTER GOES INTO THAT? >> NOT VERY MUCH. >> Stephen: HOW MUCH-- VERSA HOW MUCH HOW MUCH IS THIS? >> ABOUT HALF A POUND. >> WE'RE BASH STG TO MAKE IT THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY TO GO IN THE PASTRY. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN MATH TO HAVE THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY. THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT IN SCHOOL. >> Stephen: NO, THEY DON'T. I'M GLAD YOU TEACH MATH AND NOT HEALTH. >> I'M VERY HEALTHY. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. >> Stephen: THERE'S STILL SOME WAX IN THAT. >> DELICIOUS. VERY HEALTHY WAX. WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE BUT OR THIS LOVELY PASTRY. AND WE'RE GOING TO WRAP IT UP -- >> WHILE COUNTING OUR CHOLESTEROL. >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: DO I BASH IT AGAIN. >> IF YOU LIKE. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE. >> Stephen: TELL ME THE RIGHT THING TO DO. >> IT'S ANYTHING YOU LIKE. MATH IS ABOUT MAKE YOUR OWN RULES UP. >> Stephen: BUT BAKING IS NOT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU MIGHT BE A GREAT MATHEMATICIAN BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD BAKING. >> WE'RE GOING TO ROLL IT OUT. >> Stephen: YOU ROLL IT OUT, OKAY. >> AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO LAYERS, TWO LAYERS OF PASTRY. NOW WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IT UP. >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT. >> I'M GOING TO FOLD IT INTO THREE. THREE. >> Stephen: NOW WE HAVE SIX LAYERS. >> WELL DONE! >> Stephen: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TIME FOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH-- >> WE'RE GOING TO ROLL IT OUT AGAIN. >> Stephen: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. >> AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FOLD IT IN THREE AGAIN. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> AND THEN IT'S GOING TO HAVE THREE TIMES SIX WHICH IS. >> Stephen: THREE TIMES SIX IS 18. >> AMAZING!

SO HERE WE'RE GOING TO-- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SIX TIMES. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO TIMES THREE, THREE, THREE, THREE, THREE, THREE, "AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PUT THREE LAYERS INTO THAT. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> SO THAT'S ANOTHER THREE. >> Stephen: SO IT'S THREE TO THE SEVENTH TIMES TWO. >> YOU CAN DO THAT, RIGHT. >> Stephen: 4,372? >> SEE, I CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE I'M A MATHEMATICIAN, NOT A CALCULATOR. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY LAYERS DO WE HAVE? >> 4-- I LOOKED IT UP EARLIER ON MY PHONE. >> Stephen: SO DID I. >> BECAUSE MATH IS NOT ACTUALLY JUST ABOUT NUMBER S. >> Stephen:  NO? >> THE PRINCIPLE OF THIS IS WE USED SOME REALLY TIDY NUMBERS TWO, THREE, VERY SMALL NUMBER S. >> Stephen:  THERE'S A SMALLER ONE. >> YEAH, OKAY.
