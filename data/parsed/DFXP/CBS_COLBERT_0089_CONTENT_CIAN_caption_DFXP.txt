QSWELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW"." I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT. IT'S MARDI GRAS. THAT MEANS FAT TUESDAY, RIGHT? >> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: OR AS IT'S KNOWN IN AMERICA, TUESDAY. OF COURSE, MARDI GRAS, THE LAST DAY BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF LENT, SO CATHOLICS LIKE ME HAVE A RELIGIOUS OBLIGATION TO EAT AND THEN DRINK AND THEN PLEAD FOR GOD'S MORSI ON "MY MOUTH FEELS LIKE IT'S FULL OF ASH WEDNESDAY." NOW, JON, YOU'RE FROM NEW ORLEANS, RIGHT? "NAWLEONS," RIGHT? AM I PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY? >> Jon: YOU GOT TO WORK ON THAT ONE. >> Stephen: WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO SAY IT? >> Jon: NEW ORLEANS. >> Stephen: WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MARDI GRAS? WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TRADITIONS DOWN THERE THAT ARE REAL TRADITIONS FROM MARDI GRAS THAT I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT? >> Jon: WE LIKE THE SECOND LINE. >> Stephen: WAS THE SECOND LINE WHAT YOU ALL WERE PLAYING. GIVE ME A SECOND LINE BEAT. WHAT'S A SECOND LINE BEAT. ♪ ♪ ♪ >> Jon: CAN YOU DO IT? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: HONESTLY, SHOULDN'T I HAVE A BIG TURKEY FEATHER HEADDRESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, STRIPPED TO THE WAIST. >> Jon: THAT'S ANOTHER HOLIDAY. >> Stephen: I DON'T KNOW. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HOLIDAYS DOWN THERE. WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE ABOUT NEW ORLEANS. >> Jon: WE LIKE KING CAKE. >> Stephen: WHAT IS KING CAKE? IS THAT THE NAMEAVE JAZZ MUSICIAN OR SOMETHING? >> Jon: NO, KING CAKE IS LIKE SWEET BREAD. AND IT HAS THE PURPLE AND YELLOW AND THE GREEN ICING. AND THERE'S A BABY INSIDE THE CAKE, ACTUALLY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU -- >> I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT LAST PART? THERE'S A BABY IN THE CAKE? >> Jon: YEAH, THERE'S A BABY IN THE CAKE. >> Stephen: LIKE, HOW BIG IS THIS BABY, JON? A LITTLE BABY. >> Jon: LITTLE BABY. >> Stephen: LIKE A TOY BABY. >> Jon: YEAH. >> Stephen: AND WHY WOULD THE BABY BE IN THE CAKE, JON? >> Jon: BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET THE BABY. ( LAUGHTER ) >> Stephen: IS THAT A METAPHOR FOR SOMETHING, JON? WHY DO YOU WANT TO GET THE BABY? >> Jon: BECAUSE IF YOU GET THE BABY, THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE NEXT CAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A GOOD LUCK BABY. >> Stephen: BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO GO GET THE CAKE FOR NEXT YEAR. >> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. >> Stephen: SOUNDS LIKE A CHOKING HAZARD. >> Jon: IT COULD BE, COULD BE. I DON'T KNOW STATS ON THAT. >> Stephen: HOPEFULLY WE ALL GET THE BABY TONIGHT. LET'S GET THE BABY. NOW, I SAW SOMETHING IN THE NEWS RECENTLY-- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER-- IT AFFECTS THE WOMEN IN MY AUDIENCE, SO I WANT TO START TONIGHT BY TALKING TO THEM. HELLO, LADIES. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, I'LL ADMIT UP FRONT THAT I AM NO EXPERT ON WOMEN. HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. YOU DON'T LIKE BEING COLD, AND YOU VOTE A LOT MORE THAN US MEN. THANK YOU FOR PICKING UP THE SLACK.  ( APPLAUSE ) YOU DO. THEY VOTE WAY MORE THAN MEN DO. ALSO, IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK. IT'S BAD FOR THE BABY, AND I ASSUME THE BABY BUMP THROWS OFF YOUR BALANCE WHEN YOU'RE DOING A KEG STANDS. BUT NOW THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL IS SAYING THAT EVEN WOMEN WHO AREN'T PREGNANT SHOULD AVOID DRINKING. AND SINCE I AM NO EXPERT ON WOMEN, HERE TO EXPLAIN FURTHER THIS IS ONE OF MY WRITERS, ARIEL DUMAS. ARIEL, WOULD YOU JOIN US PLEASE? ( APPLAUSE ) ARIEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SAY HI TO ARIEL, EVERYBODY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ARIEL. NOW, YOU ARE, IN FACT, A WOMAN, CORRECT? >> YES. >> Stephen: CAN I SEE SOME I.D.? AND SEX: "F." CHECKS OUT. >> THAT'S HOW I CHECK, TOO. >> Stephen: All LRIGHT. SO, ARIEL. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS NEW C.D.C. WARNING THAT WOMEN SHOULDN'T DRINK, EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PREGNANT? >> WELL, THEY RELEASED THIS GRAPHIC. JIM, CAN WE PUT THAT UP? ACCORDING TO THE C.D.C., ANY WOMAN WHO DRINKS IS AT RISK FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AND/OR UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. >> Stephen: WOW. SO THAT MEANS KATHIE LEE AND HODA ARE REALLY LIVING ON THE EDGE EVERY DAY. I ASSUME THE C.D.C. HAS A SIMILAR WARNING FOR MEN? >> Stephen: NO, THEY DO NOT. >> Stephen: MAYBE WE DON'T NEED IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT P.S.A. ABOUT THE RISKS OF DRINKING AND THEN HAVING AN ICE COLD TRAIN COME THROUGH AND COOL OFF THE WHOLE BIKINI VOLLEYBALL TEAM. THERE IS A SERIOUS RISK OF CARPEL TUNNEL FROM HIGH-FIVING YOUR BROs. >> OH, THIS WARNING WAS LONG OVERDUE. ANY TIME WE DRINK, WE COULD GET PREGNANT. LET'S SAY YOU'RE HOME ALONE, CATCHING UP ON "EMPIRE." WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT CRACK OPEN THAT CHARDONNAY. YOU'LL BE IN A CAB TO YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND'S FASTER THAN COOKIE CAN SAY, "YOU MESSING WITH THE WRONG BITCH LOOSHUS." >> Stephen: THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP, WHAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE MEN? WHAT ABOUT THE LADIES WHO DATE LADIES? SHOULD THEY DRINK? >> THEY'RE NOT SAFE, EITHER. YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND MIGHT THINK IT'S JUST MILLER TIME, BUT ONE SIP, AND YOU'RE RUNNING DOWNSTAIRS TO THE GUY IN 3B WITH A TURKEY BASTER. ( LAUGHTER ) HE'LL THINK IT'S FUN UNTIL YOU CAPTURE HIS SEED, ENSLAVE HIM, AND RAISE THE CHILD TO SACRIFICE AT YOUR COVEN! >> Stephen: ALL RIGHT, THAT HAPPENS FAR TOO OFTEN. >> OH, YEAH. >> Stephen: THANK YOU, ARIEL. THANK YOU, ARIEL. ARIEL DUMAS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR LUMBERJACKING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ARIEL. OFFICIAL WOMAN. ACTUAL WOMAN. WELL, I'VE GOT A WARNING OF MY OWN RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT AN INTOXICATING SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FIRST I'LL BE SITTING DOWN WITH OLIVIA WILDE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S WHAT I SAY. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. SHE STARS IN "VINYL" ON HBO, A SHOW BASED ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY OF THE 70s, WHICH ITSELF WAS BASED ON THE COCAINE INDUSTRY OF THE 70s. THEN I'LL TALK TO THE LEGENDARY CNN FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) CHRISTIANE-- SHE COVERS STORIES ANYWHERE IT'S TOO COLD FOR ANDERSON COOPER TO APPEAR IN A T-SHIRT. AND FOR MARDI GRAS, WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PERFORMANCE BY NONE OTHER THAN MY MUSICAL DIRECTOR, JON BATISTE, EVERYBODY. ( BAND PLAYING ) SPEAKING OF WHICH, THAT SOUND YOU HEAR IS STAY HUMAN WITH THE JON BATISTE I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. SAY HI, EVERYODY. JON'S GETTING WARMED UP FOR HIS SOLO PERFORMANCE LATER TONIGHT, YOU HAVE A GUEST JOINING US TONIGHT. WHO IS THIS? >> Stephen: IN HONOR OF MARDI GRAS, WE BROUGHT OUR OWN KERMIN RUFFINS ON THE TROMBONE. >> Stephen: BEFORE THEY KING THINGS OFF, ONE MORE THING: A FLORIDA MAN WAS ARRESTED FOR THROWING A LIVE ALLIGATOR THROUGH THE WINDOW OF A WENDY'S DRIVE-THROUGH. HE HAS BEEN ARRESTED BECAUSE WENDY'S IN FLORIDA ONLY ACCEPTS SNAKES. >> TONIGHT, STEPHEN WELCOMES OLIVIA WILDE. AND CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR. FEATURING JON BATISTE AND STAY HUMAN. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR "THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT"! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANKS SO MUCH. DO YOU FEEL IT? >> Jon: I'M FILIN IT, YEAH. WOE. WHOA. >> Stephen: FOLKS, THANKS SO MUCH. AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW, THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARIES ARE ROLLING IN, AND THE EXCITEMENT IS PALPABLE. IN FACT, I THINK I MAY HAVE REACHED PEAK PALP, BECAUSE THIS IS THE BIG ONE. THE WINNERS SURVIVE AND MOVE ONTO THE NEXT PRIMARY, WHILE THE LOSERS ARE RELEASED INTO THE NORTH WOODS TO BE HUNTED BY THEIR DONORS. AS IS TRADITIONAL WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE THERE ARE SOME EXTREMELY EARLY RETURNS. >> THE FIRST VOTES ARE ALREADY IN. OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH AND VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS GOT AN EARLY BOOST THIS MORNING. THEY WON THE VOTE IN DIXVILLE NOTCH. THAT'S THE NEW HAMPSHIRE HAMLET THAT IS HOME TO THE FIRST VOTE AND THE FIRST-IN-THE-NATION PRIMARY. >> Stephen: YES, AT 12:01 THIS MORNING, BERNIE SANDERS AND JOHN KASICH WON THE TOWN THAT VOTES EARLIEST, DIXVILLE NOTCH. STILL WAITING FOR RESULTS FROM THE NEARBY HAMLETS OF CROTCHVILLE GROIN, JOCKSTRAP HUMP, AND SACK HOLLOW. ( LAUGHTER ) GOOD PEOPLE IN SACK HOLLOW. NOW, IN 2008 HILLARY CLINTON BEAT BARACK OBAMA IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, EVEN THOUGH HE EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO WIN THE NOMINATION. THIS TIME, BERNIE SANDERS IS LEADING HILLARY BY A LARGE MARGIN. SO HE COULD BE OUR NEXT OPENLY RESENTFUL RESENTFUL SECRETARY OF STATE. AND I'M NOT SURPRISED BERNIE IS LEADING, SINCE HE HAILS FROM NEIGHBORING VERMONT, AND A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF NEW HAMPSHIRITES CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE ON A MAP. BUT THE REAL RACE IS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, WHERE EACH CANDIDATE IS DESPERATE TO PROVE THEY'RE THE ONE WHO CAN MAKE BARACK OBAMA A TWO-TERM PRESIDENT. NOW, A TRADITIONAL PART OF CAMPAIGNING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IS POLITICIANS INFLICTING THEMSELVES ON EVERY VOTER AT EVERY LOCATION AT EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY, WHICH IS HOW WE GOT THIS AMAZING PHOTOGRAPH FROM A CARLY FIORINA EVENT YESTERDAY AT A DINER IN MANCHESTER. THERE'S FIORINA IN A SCRUM OF REPORTERS, WHILE THIS WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE JUST TRIES TO FINISH THER COFFEE AND EGGS. "EXCUSE ME, UM, I ASKED FOR A BOOTH AWAY FROM THE ( BLEEP )?" I LOVE HER. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE IT. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WOMAN IS ABLE TO IGNORE THE POLITICAL CIRCUS SWIRLING AROUND HER. IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT PEPPER SHAKER RIGHT DOWN IN FRONT HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING PRESIDENT THAN CARLY FIORINA. AND FOLKS ONLINE HAVE BEEN HAVING FUN WITH THIS PICTURE. SHE'S BEEN PHOTOSHOPPED INTO EDWARD HOPPER'S "NIGHTHAWKS," THE LAST SUPPER, AND O.J. SIMPSON'S BRONCO. CHASE. THERE SHE IS, O.J., THE REAL KILLER! GO GET HER! BUT THIS WOMAN CLEARLY WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE SO LET US ALL RESPECT THAT FOR HER. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I'M SORRY. IS MY SHOW BOTHERING YOU? ( LAUGHTER ) HEAT YOU UP THERE FOR A SECOND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT INTERESTED IN CARLY FIORINA. IS THERE ANOTHER CANDIDATE THAT YOU LIKE MORE? ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS QUITE A STRUGGLE FOR THAT EGG JUST NOW. ( LAUGHTER ) OR IS THE PROBLEM YOU WOULD JUST RATHER THAT EVERYBODY, INCLUDING ME, JUST STOP TALKING ABOUT POLITICS? ( LAUGHTER ) OKAY, THEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH OLIVIA WILDE. ♪ ♪ ♪ ( APPLAUSE ) ( BAND PLAYING ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY.

DO YOU FOLLOW THE POLITICS. >> I DO, I FOLLOW THE POLITIC S. >> Stephen:  I'M NOT SURPRISED. YOUR DAD IS A JOURNALIST AND YOUR MOM IS A "60 MINUTES" PRODUCER. >> I WAS RAISED BY TWO JOURNALISTS, MY AUNTS AND UNCLES. >> Stephen: WAS IT HARD COMING OUT TO THEM AND TELLING THEM YOU WERE GOING TO BE AN ACTOR? DID YOU HAVE TO SIT THEM DOWN AND SAY, "MOM, DAD"-- >> LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD WITH SUCH INTEGRITY AS YOU. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE VERY COOL FROM THE BEGINNING. WHAT WAS HARD WAS TO LIE TO THEM BECAUSE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS ARE REALLY HARD TO LIE TO. >> Stephen: UH-HUH. AND JUST WHERE WAS THIS PARTY, OLIVIA? >> EXACTLY. THERE WAS NOTHING -- >> SO IF BARBARA'S PARENTS ARE IN TOWN, HOW COME THERE ARE NO CARS IN THEIR DRIVEWAY. >> EXACTLY. >> Stephen: HOW ABOUT BOOK REPORTS, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WAS IT, "THOUGH, THIS FIRST PHOTOGRAPH IS FAT. YOU'RE JUST CLEARING YOUR THROAT HERE. THIS IS ACCURATE BUT NOT FAIR. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PRINT THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PRINT THIS." >> THEY WERE VERY COOL. THEY WERE FIERCELY PASSIONATE ABOUT DEFENDING MY CREATIVE INSTINCT S. >> Stephen:  THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU BEING AN ACTRESS, NO WORRIES AT ALL? IT'S REALLY TOUGH. 95% OF ACTORS AND ACTRESSES DON'T WORK. >> I KNOW. I THINK THEY KNEW IF IT DIDN'T WORK I WOULD STOP AFTER A WHILE AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE. LIKE I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO COLLEGE. I WAS GOING TO BARD COLLEGE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. >> Stephen: SURE. THAT'S SUPER CRUNCHY. >> SUPER. >> Stephen: SUPER CRUNCHY. MAYBE YOU'LL TAKE CLASSES, MAYBE YOU WON'T KIND OF COLLEGE. >> SEE HOW I FEEL. >> Stephen: MAKE YOUR OWN MAJOR KIND OF COLLEGE. >> ORGIES IN THE WATER FALL. >> Stephen: I WENT TO THE WRONG COLLEGE. >> IT WAS GREAT. BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY WENT. I MUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST POPULAR ROOMMATE TO SIGN UP FOR EVERY YEAR BECAUSE I NEVER SHOWED UP. >> Stephen: YOU WERE OFF ACTING OR SOMETHING? >> YEAH, I KEPT DEFERRING BECAUSE I STARTED WORKING. >> Stephen: THE SHOW "VINYL" IS ABOUT A WILD TIME IN ROCK 'N' ROLL, BACK WHEN THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY IN MUSIC TO BE WILD. >> YEAH. >> Stephen: THESE WERE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF MONEY LIVING CRAZY LIVES. >> YEAH. ALTHOUGH IT'S INTERESTING IN THE WHOLE KIND OF ETHOS BEHIND THE SHOW IS THE RECORD LABELS WERE STEALING FROM THE ARTISTS. WHICH IS WHY MICK JAGGER, OUR PRODUCER, WANTED TO TELL THE STORY BECAUSE LABELWERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ARTIST AND CHARGING THEM FOR PRODUCTION OF THE ALBUM S. >> Stephen:  HE WAS WENT TO THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS. SO HE KNEW HE WAS BEING RIPPED OFF. HONEST TO GOD, HE DID. >> HE TOOK CONTROL OF THE STONES' FINANCES AND THEY BECAME A VERY TOUGH BAND TO RIP OFF. >> Stephen: NOW, THERE'S A LOT IN THIS-- WE HAD BOBBY CANNAVALE ON HERE THE OTHER NIGHT. >> THE BEST. >> Stephen: AMAZING. AND THERE'S A LOT OF COCAINE. >> SO MUCH COCAINE. >> Stephen: COTAIN TAKEN IN THIS. NOW, DOES YOUR CHARACTER DO COCAINE? >> NO, NO LUCK THERE. >> Stephen: NO. IT'S NOT REAL COCAINE. THEY'RE NOT DOING REALLY COCAINE. I MEAN, IT IS HBO. >> WE DON'T KNOW. >> WE DON'T KNOW. >> Stephen: THEY DO EXCELLENT PRODUCTIONS. >> EXACTLY. IT'S NOT BABY LAXATIVE. IT'S MILK POWDER. >> Stephen: STILL, I WOULD NOT WANT TO SNORT MILK POWDER. WHAT IF YOUR LUNGS TURNED OUT TO BE LACTOSE INTOLERANT? THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS. THAT COULD BE BAD. >> IT'S FUNNY. THERE ARE MOUNTAINS OF IT EVERYWHERE. IT'S A HILARIOUS SET. >> Stephen: YOU'RE A DIRECTOR, TOO, RIGHT? >> I AM. I DID A MUSIC ALBUM IN NEW ORLEANS. EDWARD SHARP AND THE MAGNETIC ZEROS. >> Stephen: THEY OPENED FOR BERNIE SANDERS A COUPLE OF NIGHTS OKAY. ARE YOU FEELING THE BERN? >> I LOVE THE BERP. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE BERN AND EVERYTHING HE'S DONE FOR YOUNG VOTERS. >> Stephen: BUT? >> BUT I AM WITH HER. >> Stephen: YOU'RE HEADED FOR THE HILLS. YOU'RE HEADED FOR THE HILLS. >> I HAVE MY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, BUT I SUPPORT THE DISCOURSE. I THINK THESE DEBATES ARE FANTASTIC. I LOVE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED. IT'S GREAT. >> Stephen: YOU ALSO EXECUTIVE PRODUCED A SHORT FILM. >> YES. >> Stephen: THAT HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR? >> YES! >> Stephen: CONGRATULATIONS. >> THANK YOU! IT'S SO GREAT. >> Stephen: IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY. >> YES. >> Stephen: IT'S A TEAM OF PEOPLE WORKING IN LIBERIA, RIGHT. >> YES. >> Stephen: WHAT ARE THEY DOING? >> IT'S CALLED BODY TEAM 12 AND THEY DURING THE EBOLA EPIDEMIC WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING THE BODIES OF THOSE WHO DIED FROM THE VIRUS. THAT WAS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THE ONLY REASON IT DIDN'T SPREAD IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE THEM WHO WERE CONTAINING THE VIRUS WHICH WAS SPREAD BY CONTACT WITH THE DEAD. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY OF HEROISM. >> Stephen: THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WENT INTO WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL THE HOT ZONE. >> YES. >> Stephen: WHERE THE DISEASE WAS SPREADING. >> YES. AND THEY WERE LOCAL MEMBERS OF THAT COMMUNITY, SO THEY WERE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS -- >> WHO IS SHOOTING THIS? WHO IS THE CAMERAMAN? >> DAVID DARD, OUR DIRECTOR? AN EXTRAORDINARY GUY. AND HE WAS WORKING AS AN AID WORKER THERE AND WAS A FILM MAKER AND STARTED FILMING FROM WITHIN. SO THE ACCESS IS JUST KIND OF INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE THAT JUST AS A FILMMAKER. >> Stephen: IS HE AN AMERICAN? >> HE'S AN AMERICAN. >> Stephen: HE WENT OVER AND DID THIS. WAS HE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE QUARANTINED WHEN HE CAME BACK? >> HE WAS QUARANTINE FORWARD 45 DAYS AND I'M ONLY LAWCHG BECAUSE, CLEARLY, IT'S THE WAY TO GET THE BEST MOVIE OUT OF YOUR DIRECTOR IS QUARANTINE THEM FOR 45 DAYS. >> Stephen: HE EDITED WHILE HE WAS IN QUARANTINE. >> HE EDITED THE FILM WHILE HE WAS IN QUARANTINE. >> Stephen: YOU ALMOST LITERALLY CHAINED HIM TO THE EDITING MACHINE. >> YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR. >> Stephen: HE'S AN EXECUTIVE PRODUCER. THAT'S WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. YOU SENT THIS TO ME. THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER WAS AT THE OLD GIG AND WE HAD AN ACT-OFF AND YOU SENT ME MY FAVORITE AWARD. I HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY TO WIN A LOT OF AWARDS. CAN WE GET A CLOSE-UP OF THIS. THIS IS AN AWARD YOU SENT TO ME, "ACTED THE HARDEST." >> YOU ACTED SO HARD. >> Stephen: THIS IS THE GREATEST. AND I PUT THIS ON SO EVERYONE WOULD KNOW, "PRESENTED TO STEPHEN COLBERT BY OLIVIA WILDE." >> I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS. >> Stephen: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS A TREASURED POSSESSION OF MINE. OLIVIA, THANK YOU FOR COMING. SAY HI TO JASON FOR ME. >> I WILL, OF COURSE. >> Stephen: "VINYL" PREMIERS FEBRUARY 14 AT 9:00 P.M. ON HBO. OLIVIA WILDE EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. MY NEXT GUEST IS THE CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AT CNN AND THE ANCHOR THE "AMANPOUR." PLEASE WELCOME CHRISTIANE AMANPOR. HOW IS EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL NEWS? >> EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL NEWS IS VERY BAD. >> Stephen: YEAH. >> VERY, VERY BAD INDEED. >> Stephen: YOU HAVE SAID WHATEVER THE MEDIUM, ONE OF YOUR GOALS IS TO MAKE FOREIGN NEWS LESS FOREIGN. >> YES. >> Stephen: HOW-- HOW DO YOU DO THAT? BECAUSE THEY GOT THE ACCENTS AND EVERYTHING. >> THEY HAVE THE ACCENTS AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE, WHICH IS KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY. >> Stephen: HOW TO YOU MAKE SOMEONE HERE IN AMERICA CARE. >> OFTEN, PARTICULARLY NOW, IT'S COMING HERE TO AMERICA. >> Stephen: NOT IF TRUMP HAS HIS WAY. NOT IF TRUMP HAS HIS WAY. HE'S GOING TO BUILD A WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SYRIA. ( LAUGHTER ). >> AND THAT WILL HELP THAT'S HOW WE TRY TO MAKE THE NEWS LESS FOREIGN, TELLING THOSE KINDS OF STORIES. >> Stephen: IS THERE A STORY HAPPENING INTERNATIONALLY RIGHT NOW THAT WE AMERICANS DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT, SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CARRYING ABOUT THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT YET? >> WELL, LOOK, YOU PRETTY MUCH KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING. BUT THE BIG STORY THAT WE HAVE TO GET FIXED IS SYRIA AND ALL THESE POOR REFUGEES WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, REALLY, REALLY IN TERRIBLE HARDSHIP. AND I THINK BEING REALLY MISREPRESENTED AND THEIR HARDSHIP AND THEIR HUMANITY JUST BEING COMPLETELY SORT OF DENIED IS PRETTY SAD. >> Stephen: IT SEEMS LIKE IT GOT TO SOME POINT-- AT A CERTAIN LEVEL PEOPLE WANT TO THROW UP THEIR HANDS. WHY TRUMP'S MESSAGE IS APPEALING IS BECAUSE HE SAYS, "JUST KEEP THEM ALL OUT" BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH FEAR ASSOCIATED WITH IT. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT SITUATION GOT SO BAD? >> I'M PRETTY STRONG, HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS. I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE WEST DIDN'T DO WHAT IT COULD HAVE DONE EARLY ENOUGH. >> Stephen: BY "WEST" YOU MEAN AMERICA? >> WELL... PERHAPS. >> Stephen: EVERYBODY ELSE IS KIND OF LIKE-- >> BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. >> Stephen: EVERYBODY ELSE IS LIKE GLADYS KNIGHT AND THE. IS. EVERYONE ELSE IS THE. IS. >> EVERYONE SAYS, "WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING." AND I ACTUALLY THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING BECAUSE VERY EARLY ON YOU COULD HAVE INTERVENED IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE LOT LESS PAINFUL THAN THEY ARE NOW. AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN INVASION, AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BOOTS ON THE GROUND, AND IT COULD HAVE REALLY CONTAINED AND STOPPED THIS BEFORE WE HAD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DEAD, BEFORE WE HAD MILLIONS OF REFUGEES, AND BEFORE WE NOW HAVE TERRORISM IN EUROPE, IN THE UNITED STATES, AND, YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE, UNFORTUNATELY, A VERY IMPORTANT CHANCE WAS MISSED IN THAT REGARD. >> Stephen: YOU'VE INTERVIEWED EVERY MAJOR WORLD LEADER. WHO HAS IMPRESSED YOU MORE THAN YOU THOUGHT? >> WELL, GOING ALL THE WAY BACK NOW SEVERAL DECADES, SOMEBODY WAS AN AMAZING, AMAZING INTERVIEW. HE WAS KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN, A VERY STRONG ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES. HE MADE PEACE WITH ISRAEL, A REALLY BRAVE, BRAVE MAN WHO HAD THESE INCREDIBLE POLICIES AND HAD THE COURAGE TO ENACT THEM. AND MAKING PEACE WITH ISRAEL, IF YOU'RE AN ARAB LEADER, IS NOT VERY POPULAR, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AND HE WAS AMAZING. AND HE ACTUALLY TREATED US JOURNALISTS AS IF HE KIND OF REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO US AND AS IF WE WEREN'T DUMB. >> Stephen: IS THAT UNUSUAL FOR A WORLD LEADER? >> YES, BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THE WHOLE SPIN CYCLE AND, YOU KNOW, HAVE THEIR TALKING POINTS. AND HE TALKED TO YOU AS IF YOU WERE A SENTIENT HUMAN BEING. THAT WAS QUITE REFRESHING. >> Stephen: ANYBODY DISAPPOINTED YOU? ANYBODY GIVE YOU, LIKE, A REALLY WEAK HANDSHAKE? >> OH, THE HANDSHAKES. >> Stephen: GIVE YOU A FISH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. >> THERE HAVE BEEN DEAD FISH. THERE HAVE BEEN ROTTEN FISH. THERE HAVE BEEN SWEATY FISH. >> Stephen: GIVE ME A HINT. WHO IS THE WORST HANDSHAKE? SOMEBODY DEAD. >> I CAN'T-- HE'S A DEAD FISH. HE'S WITH THE FISHES. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT THE WORST FOR ME WAS WHEN I WOULD INTERVIEW, LET'S SAY THE IRANIAN LEADERS. LIKE I GET THIS AMAZING SCOOP, AND I'M PSYCHED AND I STICK MY HAND OUT AND THE HAPPENED IS HERE BECAUSE, NO, THEY CANNOT SHAKE HANDS WITH A WOMAN. >> Stephen: BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO, THAT RIGHT? WHY CAN THAT SURPRISE YOU? >> IT'S THEIR RELIGION, WELL, YOU FORGET. >> Stephen: THAT SHOCKS YOU? >> YOU FORGET. >> Stephen: YOU FORGET? >> YES, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BEFORE THE REVOLUTION. >> Stephen: BEFORE THE REVOLUTION THAT WASN'T THERE? >> NO, I REMEMBER SHAKING A LOT OF HANDS IN RAWP BEFORE THE REVOLUTION. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE HAD A REVOLUTION. OH, YOU HAVE A GOOD, GOOD, GOOD HANDSHAKE. >> Stephen: THANK YOU. >> I LIKE THAT ONE. >> Stephen: CAN YOU STICK AROUND? >> YES. >> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) >> Stephen:  WE'RE BACK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR. CHRISTIANE, I UNDERSTAND-- I HEARD THIS FROM MY LITTLE RESEARCH PACKAGE HERE, WHILE YOU'RE A WELL-KNOWN JOURNALIST NOW, YOU SAY YOU'RE AN ACCIDENTAL JOURNALIST, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> WELL, AFTER THE REVOLUTION IN IRAN, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IN ANY EVENT, MY PARENT WERE STUCK THERE AND WE WERE IN ENGLAND GLPPED AND MY SISTER DECIDED TO SIGN HERSELF UP TO A JOURNALIST COLLEGE IN LONDON. AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS SHE DECIDED THIS WAS NOT FOR HER. SO I WENT BACK AND SAID CAN WE HAVE OUR MONEY BACK, PLEASE, BECAUSE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO THROW IT AWAY. THEY SAID NO, AND I SAID I CAN TAKE THE COURSE INSTEAD? AND THAT'S WHAT I DID AND THAT'S HOW I BECAME A JOURNALIST.  ( APPLAUSE ). >> Stephen: WOW. AND YOU GOT HOOKED. >> I GOT HOOKED. >> Stephen: YOU GOT TOTALLY HOOKED. >> I GOT TOTALLY HOOKED. AND THEN I CAME HERE, THE GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND JOINED CNN AND SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SCRAMBLED MY WAY. >> Stephen: ARE YOU REPORTING ALL THE TIME. ARE YOU ALWAYS IN THAT MODE, LOOKING FOR THE STORY. >> ALWAYS, EVEN RIGHT NOW. >> Stephen: RIGHT NOW. >> RIGHT NOW. >> Stephen: EVEN THIS SECOND, TODAY? >> IN FACT TODAY I FOUND SOME INCREDIBLE SCOOPS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. >> Stephen: REALLY? >> I DID. >> Stephen: A CRISIS? >> A BIT OF A CRISIS. YOU COULD CALL IT THAT. >> Stephen: I'D LOVE TO SEE IT. >> I BROUGHT SOME TAPES. I BROUGHT SOME REPORTS. JIM? DAWN HAS BROKEN AND IN A CONSTANT STREAM THEY COME, HERE, TO THE 11th FLOOR KITCHENET, THE BELEAGUERED "LATE SHOW" PRODUCTION STAFF ESCAPE FROM THEIR TOIL, HOWEVER BRIEFLY, TO RIFLE THROUGH THESE DRAWERS AND CABINETS IN A DESPERATE SEARCH FOR CARBOHYDRATES. AND, SADLY, FOR THOSE HOPING FOR CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH, IT IS ALREADY TOO LATE. WHAT DOES REMAIN IS THIS FRUIT CUP AND, APPARENTLY, HEALTHY SNACK, BUT IN REALITY, PROCESSED PEACH CUBES DROWNING IN HEAVY SYRUP, DOOMING THESE LOST SOULS TO RETURN HERE HOUR AFTER HOUR, TRAPPED IN A HEARTBREAKING CYCLE OF SUGAR CRASH AND SUGAR CRAVING, FROM WHICH THEY WILL NEVER BREAK FREE. ANDERSON. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE "LATE SHOW" GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT IS A VERITABLE WASTELAND OF UNWASHED HAIR AND SNACK REF USE. THE STALE ODOR OF CHEETOS, RED BULL, AND SADNESS FILL THE AIR. SLEEP DEPRIVED, THEY DUTIFULLY CARRY OUT THEIR SUPERIOR'S ORDERS, GRAPHICALLY ADDING DONALD TRUMP'S HAIR TO ANY ANIMAL YOU CAN THINK OF IT. ( LAUGHTER ) NEVER THINKING TO ASK THE QUESTION, "WHY?" WOLF. >> Stephen: OKAY, CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, WHAT'S HER DEAL? SHE'S IMPRESSIVE, LIKE? SHE'S GOT, LINE, NINE EMMYS, RIGHT? >> I THINK IT'S NINE GLI HAVE INTERVIEWED HER BEFORE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER, IS SHE FROM ENGLAND OR LONDON. >> BORN IN LONDON, SHE STARTED AT THE FOREIGN DESK AT CNN IN 1973, AND COVERED THE REVOLUTION IN ROMANIA IN '89, THE FIRST GULF WAR AND THE WAR IN BOSNIA. >> Stephen: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW. >> ANDERSON? >> Stephen: SO WHO IS NEXT? >> OLIVIA WILDE. >> Stephen: OKAY. >> I HAVE 11 EMMYS.
