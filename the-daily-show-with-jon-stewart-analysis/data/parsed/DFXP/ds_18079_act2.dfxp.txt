Jon: WE WILL WELCOME WHACK. -- WELCOME BACK. LISTEN, SUNDAY WAS EASTER THERE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD TIME TO  CHECK IN WITH THE NEW POPE  FRANCIS I AND SEE HOW HE IS HOLDING UP.
HE IS SETTING A NEW TONE WITH  THE PAPACY CHOOSING TO WEAR  SIMPLE WHITE VESTMENTS, SHAKE HANDS WITH THE PUBLIC AND FOCUS  ON THE POOR.
PRESENTING THE PRIESTHOOD AS  A TASK OF SERVICE.
CHOOSING A SIMPLE APARTMENT  OVER THE GRAND PAPAL REDZ DENSE  WEARING A SOCCER JERSEY FROM HIS FAVORITE TIME.
Jon: FOODING THE COMMUNION  IN TUPPERWARE. TRADING IN THE POPE MOBILE FOR  THE POPE MOPED. WHAT ELSE IS HE DOING?
PAYING HIS HOTEL BILL AFTER  BECOMING POPE.
Jon: POPES DIDN'T USE TO  PAY THEIR HOTEL BILLS? [LAUGHTER] THE OTHER POPES WHEN DID THEY DO  WHEN THEY WENT TO CHECK OUT JUST  LIKE -- [LAUGHTER] HEY, THIS THINGS GOT NO POCKETS  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? THIS POPE FRANCIS SEEMS LIKE A  BREATH OF FRESH AIR. I LIKE. THIS HE PREFERS THE TITLE OF  BISHOP OF ROME SIMPLER AND LESS  MAJESTIC THAN POPE OR HIS  HOLINESS.
Jon: PLEASE HIS HOLINESS  LIVES IN FLORIDA. [ LAUGHTER ] BASICALLY EVERYTHING POPE  FRANCIS DOES IS A STANDING  REPROACH TO THE MORE FLASHY STYLE OF PREDECESSOR. I'M NOT SAYING POPE BENEDICT DID  IT BUT EVERY TIME HE WENT TO  MEXICO KIDS HIT HIM WITH STICKS HOPING JEWELS WOULD POUR OUT. WHAT IS THE MOST UNBENEDICT-LIKE  THING POPE FRANCIS COULD DO?
INSTEAD OF WASHING THE FEET  OF 12 PRIESTS ON HOLY THURSDAY  HE DISREGARDED THE CUT OF YOM AND WASHED THE FEET OF 12  PRISONERS INCLUDING A MUSLIM  WOMAN.
Jon: I DON'T SEE ANYBODY'S  RELIGION, JUST 24 REALLY DIRTY  FEET OR 120 VERY DIRTY TOES. LET'S DO THIS AGAIN. THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT TO  CONFESSION. THIS LITTLE PIGGY WENT TO  PRISON. YOU ARE NOT A GOOD PIGGY. I LOVE THIS GUY. HE IS GIVING PRISONERS  MANNY-POPIS. WE SHOULD CALL HIM POPE RAYMOND  BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVES HIM. IT'S ONLY THE SECOND WEEK ON THE  JOB HOW DO YOU TOP THIS?
HE IS MARKING THE WEEKEND  WITH MANY FIRSTS. ON ITALIAN TELEVISION TODAY HE  DID SOMETHING POPES RARELY DO.
Jon: LET LION GOES FROM A  HOT AIR BALLOON? HARLEM SHAKE? CALL THE ARISTOCRATS --
HE DID SOMETHING POPES REALLY  DO PARTICIPATING IN A BROADCAST  SPECIAL ON THE SHROUD OF TURIN. IT'S THE FIRST SHOWING OF THE  SHROUD ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN  HISTORY.
Jon: WHAT A RELIEF TO  CATHOLICS EVERYWHERE TO HAVE  THEIR NEW POPE GO ON TELEVISION AND THIS IS THE ONLY DIRTY  LAUNDRY HE WILL BE AIRING. WE'LL BE
