(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! OH, IF TODAY IS -- WHAT DAY IS TODAY, WEDNESDAY? -- IF TODAY'S WEDNESDAY, IT'S TIME TO CHECK IN ON THE UNITED KINGDOM. REALLY HASN'T BEEN A KINGDOM FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AND NOW TURNS OUT THE UNITED PART IS LOOKING A BIT SHAKY AS WELL.
IN JUST OVER A WEEK SCOTLAND WILL VOTE ON WHETHER TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM. POLLS SHOW RIVAL CAMPAIGNS FOR AND AGAINST INDEPENDENCE RUNNING NECK-IN-NECK.
Jon: NECK-IN-NECK, BY THE WAY THE FIRST TWO INGREDIENTS IN HAGIS. SCOTLAND-- REALLY, THE RAY RICE TAPE, THEY CAN WATCH, THAT PICTURE-- OOH SAUSAGE. SCOTLAND'S BIG SECESSION VOTE IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF-- DEMACALYPSE 2014. IT IS NOT THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S PROUDEST MOMENT, WHO ONCE DOMINATED HALF THE GLOBE. BUT IF YOU LOSE SCOTLAND YOU'RE DOWN TO THE ONE CORNER OF IRELAND THAT DOESN'T HATE YOU, AND WALES. TERRITORY WITH SO FEW NATURAL RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO IMPORT VOWELS. OF COURSE THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE-- IT'S HARD TO VISIT THERE. IT'S HARD TO GET AROUND. (APPLAUSE) THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE AT STAKE HERE THAN PRIDE, YES.
THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY AT STAKE. MOST OF THE U.K.'S OIL RESERVES ARE OFF SCOTLAND SHORES. SCOTLAND IS THE EUROPEAN UNION'S LARGEST OIL PRODUCER. AND THE BRITISH NUCLEAR SUBMARINE FLEET IS HEADQUARTERED IN SCOTLAND.
Jon: OIL RICH WITH NUKES -- I BET DICK CHENEY JUST WENT WHAT? WHERE? WHAT? WHAT? HUH? WHAT? CAN I-- CAN I INVADE? SO WHAT-- WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS HERE? -- YOU LIKE THAT? WHAT ARE THE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS HERE?
RONALD McDONALD, ONE OF THE TOP ECONOMISTS IN THE U.K.-- .
Jon: ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GOING TO --  (LAUGHTER) THAT POOR SWEET MAN. HOW WAS HE TO KNOW LITERALLY EIGHT YEARS AFTER HE WAS BORN HIS PROUD NAME WOULD BE STOLEN BY AN AMERICAN HAMBURGER CLOWN. IT'S PERHAPS A PROBLEM HE CAN ONLY DISCUSS WITH HIS GOOD FRIENDS PAUL FRANKLIN CHANG. AND THADDEUS GEORGE IRVING FRIDAY. BUT THIS WHOLE VOTING TO LEAVE THE UNITED KINGDOM, WELL, IT BRINGS UP A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. NAMELY, YOU CAN DO THAT? BECAUSE WE KIND OF HAD TO FIGHT A WHOLE WAR WITH THE TEA IN THE HARBOR AND THE BRITISH ARE COMING AND THE TWO IF BY SEA. MEANWHILE YOU JUST STICK IT ON THE AGENDA AND YOU'RE LIKE YEAH,  [BLEEP] IT, WE'RE GONE. AND NOT JUST HERE IN THE U.S. AFRICA HAD TO FIGHT YOU, INDIA STARVED THEMSELVES TO GET FREE. 700 YEARS AFTER WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, MEL GIBSON WALLACE WAS DRAWN AND QUARTERED FOR SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE, IT TURNS OUT THEY JUST HAD TO HAVE AN ELECTION. ENGLAND, ARE YOU JUST GOING TO LET THEM GO?
BRITAIN'S POLITICAL LEADERS LIKE DAVID CAMERON HAVE HEADED NORTH. TODAY THEY'VE ALL GONE UP TO SCOTLAND TO DELIVER A KIND OF COLLECTIVE POLITICAL LOVEBOMB.
Jon: OH, A LOVEBOMB. THAT SOUNDS STICKY. (LAUGHTER) I BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY HAVE FOOTAGE OF PRIME MINISTER CAMERON PLEADING WITH THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE TO COME BACK. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE SOUND OF AIR SLOWLY GETTING PUSHED FROM A BAG? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
