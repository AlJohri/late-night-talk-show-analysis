[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A FINE ACTOR. HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED "PRISONERS."
YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D KEEP HIM IN CUSTODY, RIGHT, AND YOU DIDN'T. RIGHT NOW WHEN I GRABBED HIM IN THE PARKING LOT, HE SAID RIGHT TO MY FACE, "THEY DIDN'T CRY UNTIL I LEFT THEM." RIGHT TO MY [bleep] FACE.
HE SAID THAT
WHAT DID I JUST SAY? IN THE PARKING LOT, BEFORE YOU GRABBED ME OFF HIM.
DID ANYONE ELSE HEAR BESIDES YOU?
I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS QUIET. HE SAID IT TO ME. HE WANTED ME TO KNOW.
ARE YOU SURE HE SAID THAT?
WHAT?
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S WHAT HE SAID?
JESUS, YOU THINK I'M MAKING THIS UP?
NO.
WHY WOULD I MAKE THAT UP?
HEY, HEY, HEY.
NO, THINK ABOUT IT, WHY WOULD I MAKE THIS UP?
Jon: THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM HUGH JACKMAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
HEY, JON.
Jon: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT WAS SOMETHING. FAIR ENOUGH. I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.
I HAVE A FEW RINGERS HERE.
Jon: NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL. YOU'RE A NICE, NICE, NICE, NICE MAN. NO, YOU ARE. YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL MAN. THIS MOVIE, WHAT GOT INTO YOU? THERE WERE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE...
YEAH.
Jon: DO YOU FIND, IN A MOVIE LIKE THIS, ARE YOU ABLE TO EXPRESS SOMETHING INSIDE YOU THAT YOU'RE NEVER REALLY ABLE TO EXPRESS?
YES.
Jon: HOW DO YOU FIND THAT DARKNESS?
SOMETIMES IT FRIGHTENS ME IN THAT I LITERALLY LIKE... THAT FELT REALLY GOOD.
Jon: YES!
I SEE PEOPLE JUST LAYING ON THE FLOOR WITH BLOOD COMING. ANYWAY, IT IS A LITTLE SURPRISING. WHEN I SAW THE FILM WITH MY WIFE DEB, SHE WAS HOLDING MY HAND, AND IT'S VERY TENSE, IT'S A GRIPPING THRILLER. SHE WAS HOLDING MY HAND, THERE WERE NAIL MARKS IN MY HAND. ABOUT HALF-WAY THROUGH SHE TOOK HER HAND AWAY FROM MINE. IT WAS VERY MUCH, WHO AM I MARRIED TO?
Jon: WHAT? OKAY.
I'VE BEEN ON THE COUCH EVER SINCE.
Jon: THIS IS A THRILLER. IT'S A SUSPENSEFUL MOVIE. IT'S A THRILLER. BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THRILLERS WHERE THEY SAY, OH, THEY WORKED ON THE CHARACTERS. THE DIALOGUE IS VERY GOOD. IT'S NOT LIKE IN YOUR MIND THE... I GUESS THE TEMPLATE FOR IT IS LIKE "TAKEN." SOMEBODY GETS KIDNAPPED AND YOU GO IN WITH AN UZI AND TAKE OUT HALF OF GERMANY. THIS IS REALLY INTENSELY PSYCHOLOGICAL.
I THINK IT PLAYS TO THE IDEA OF "DEATH WISH" OR "TAKEN" WHERE IN THE BEGINNING EVEN WITH MY CHARACTER, YOU'RE GOING ALONG AS AN AUDIENCE, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, THEN IT STARTS TO MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT MAKES YOU THINK, AND LONG AFTER THE CREDITS ROLE IT QUESTIONS YOU ABOUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THAT SITUATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK, ISSUES OF VIOLENCE AND HOW WE HANDLE THAT AS A COMMUNITY, AS A COUNTRY.
Jon: AND I THINK THE ANSWER OF COURSE IS VERY WELL. WE HANDLE IT ALL UNBELIEVABLY WELL
AS YOU'VE SHOWN IN TONIGHT'S SHOW.
Jon: VERY WELL. DIDN'T AUSTRALIA... AUSTRALIA PASSED SWEEPING GUN REGULATIONS 16 YEARS AGO AND IT HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY.
IT WAS INTERESTING. OUR CONSERVATIVE LEADER AT THE TIME. WE HAD MASS SHOOTING AND IT WAS A BIG WAKE-UP CALL. IN AUSTRALIA, I HATE TO SAY, BUT YOU'RE USED TO HEARING IT OUT OF THE UNITED STATES. LIKE YOU HEAR THESE THINGS, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED THERE. IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS THIS GOVERNMENT BUYBACK I BELIEVE AND EVERYONE JUST HANDED IN THEIR GUNS AND THEY DESTROYED THEM. THE CONSERVATIVE LEADER AT THE TIME SAID THIS HAS GOT TO STOP, AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY JUST WENT FOR IT.
IT WAS HOWARD, WASN'T IT?
HOWARD. HE'S GONE NOW.
Jon: GONE NOW. NOT GONE NOW. HE'S ALIVE.
YES, HE IS ALIVE. POLITICALLY GONE.
Jon: ISN'T IT TERRIBLE? LIKE IN AMERICA, HE'S STILL THERE, RIGHT? I HAVE NO [BLEEPED] IDEA. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY. WE ONLY FOLLOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY. I THINK OTHER COUNTRIES VIEW THIS AS A KIND OF MADNESS. I THINK THEY VIEW IT WHY CAN'T THEY...
IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND. LOOK, THERE IS A CONSTITUTION, I GET IT, IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND, BUT LOOK OTHER COUNTRIES, I THINK WHEN I WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA, AND I THINK HOW AMAZING IT IS THAT THAT COUNTRY VOLUNTARILY DISARMED THEMSELVES OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. LIKE YOU SPEND MANY, MANY YEARS GETTING ONE, AND YOU'RE IN THE CLUB. AND THAT JUST WENT, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR THE WORLD. WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF IT.
MAYBE THEY KNEW THEMSELVES. THEY'RE LIKE, YOU DON'T WANT US WITH ONE OF THESE. I GOT MY EYE ON NEW ZEALAND RIGHT NOW. COME HERE, BUDDY. THAT'S WHY I LIKE CANADA. BECAUSE THEY... [SCATTERED APPLAUSE] EXCEPT FOR THAT GUY.
HE LIKES YOU. IT'S OKAY.
Jon: BUT THERE IS MATURITY TO THAT COUNTRY THAT I FEEL LIKE CAN SET A GREAT EXAMPLE. I'M NOT TRYING TO...
LISTEN, AS AN OUTSIDER, I'M GOING TO SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN AND MANY OUTSIDERS HAVE BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF UNBELIEVABLE GENEROSITY IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE TAKING A COMPLIMENT?
Jon: ABSOLUTELY. IT'S NOT ME.
DON'T FORGET, IT'S A COUNTRY OF 300 MILLION ODD PEOPLE. AUSTRALIA AT THE TIME IS 17 MILLION PEOPLE. SOMETHING SHOCKING HAPPENS, AND THE LEADER SAYS YEAH LET'S GET RID OF OUR GUNS. LET'S DO IT. IT'S NOT LIKE...
Jon: IT'S A MORE MANAGEABLE POPULATION.
I'M A BIG FAN OF SOCRATES AND HE WAS A BIG GADFLY TO ATHENS AT THE TIME. BUT EVEN HE SAID THE THING WITH... YOU NEED A GAD FLY BECAUSE IT'S MASSIVE. ATHENS, AMERICA, THEY'RE MASSIVE AND BIG. THEY'RE LIKE BIG OXES THEY DON'T TURN QUICKLY. NOTHING TURNS QUICKLY. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. IN A WAY, THAT MAY NOT BE BAD THING. SOMETHING HAS A BIT OF STABILITY.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TURN AN OX? BECAUSE IF WE DON'T TURN THIS OX AT SOME POINT, AND IT'S NOT EVEN...
JUST SHOOT AT IT.
Jon: THAT'S HOW YOU SOLVE IT. IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME. SON OF A BITCH! YOU GOT TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE. THE PERFORMANCES ALONE, IT'S A GREAT STORY, AND THE WAY IT'S DONE, IT CAN BE A TOUGH WATCH AT TIMES, BUT THE PERFORMANCES IN IT, YOUR WORK.
THANK YOU AND CONGRATS TO YOU ON FINISHING YOUR MOVIE.
IT'S DONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
AND LOOK, I KNOW WHEN I AUDITIONED YOU SAID I WASN'T QUITE RIGHT, BUT I'M JUST SAYING...
WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT ANIMATED AND IN 3-D, THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO LOVE IT. PRISONERS IS IN THE THEATER ON FRIDAY.
