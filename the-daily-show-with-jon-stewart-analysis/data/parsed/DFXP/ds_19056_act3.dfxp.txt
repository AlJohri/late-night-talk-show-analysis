[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER AND SERVES CALIFORNIA'S 12th DISTRICT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM NANCY PELOSI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M OKAY.
Jon: HOW ARE THINGS?
GREAT.
Jon: HOW IS YOUR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE?
I'M COVERED.
Jon: COULD YOU GET ONLINE ARE THINGS GOOD?
THINGS ARE GOOD AND THINGS WILL BE BETTER. YES.
Jon: VERY GOOD. EVERY TIME I SEE CONGRESSPEOPLE ON TELEVISION, THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY ARE ASKED ALWAYS HAVE TO DO WITH THE POLITICS.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHO IS -- HOW IS THAT GOING TO EFFECT THE POLITICS. WHO IS GOING TO RUN IN 2016. ALL THAT. LET ME ASK YOU IN TERMS OF LIKE GOVERNANCE --
RIGHT.
Jon: -- IS IT SURPRISING THAT THERE'S NOT AS MUCH TALK AND THOUGHT ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF GOVERNANCE AS THERE IS TO THE POLITICS AND CONFLICT? THE WHOLE IDEA IS REALLY ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE.
Jon: CORRECT.
AND THE VISION THAT YOU HAVE AND HOW YOU -- WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT AND HOW YOU PLAN TO EXECUTE AND HOW YOU CAN ATTRACT PEOPLE TO IT. AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A BIG DIFFERENCE AS THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A TRADITIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
Jon: RIGHT.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IN THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS THAT IS ANTI-GOVERNMENT, ANTISCIENCE ANTI-OBAMA. THEY HAVE A TRIFECTA THAT ENABLES THEM TO VOTE AGAINST EVERYTHING. AS YOU SAW IN THE STATE OF THE UNION THEY COULDN'T APPLAUD FOR EVERYTHING. HARD WORKING FAMILIES EVOKE NO RESPONSE.
Jon: THEY ALSO HAVE, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, VERY SENSITIVE HANDS. IF THEY WERE TO CLAP IT COULD CAUSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN. I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT PUTS THE ONUS IN SOME RESPECTS ON THE DEMOCRATS TO PROVE THEIR CASE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE FORCEFULLY ABOUT THE COMPETENCE OF GOVERNMENT. HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT IS GOING BECAUSE ON OUR END IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A BIT CHAOTIC.
IT LOOKS THAT WAY.
Jon: I HAVE ANOTHER WORD THAT I USE FOR THAT ENDS IN SOMETHING TERRIBLE.
AWW.
Jon: WHY DO WE HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE EXECUTING THE PLANS WITH ANY KIND OF EFFICIENCY?
WELL, AGAIN, IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO NO AGENDA, NOTHING IS THEIR AGENDA AND NEVER IS THE TIMETABLE IT'S VERY HARD TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM. SO WE ARE RESPONSIBLE. IN OTHER WORDS CALL US RESPONSIBLE. THEY KNOW WE'RE GOING TO VOTE NOT TO SHUT DOWN GOVERNMENT AND VOTE FOR THE BUDGET NO MATTER HOW UNPLEASANT IT IS. THE CHOICE IS TO BE IRRESPONSIBLE OR WE DON'T WANT TO BE FEAR-MONGERS BUT TO EXPLAIN THIS IS BAD NEWS. WE WANT TO BE POSITIVE.
Jon: I MEANT MORE IN TERMS OF WE'RE GOING TO SET UP A HEALTH CARE WEB SITE THAT IS AN EXCHANGE. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME TO IT. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET A COMPANY TO EXECUTE THAT COMPETENTLY?
I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] AS ONE WHO -- THAT'S MY QUESTION.
Jon: LET ME GET THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER I CAN ASK HER. HOLD ON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW? HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW?
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. WE WORKED VERY HARD TO HONOR THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PASS THE BILL THAT HONORS THE BELIEFS OF THE FOUNDERS LIFE, LIBERTY TO PURSUE YOUR HAPPINESS.
Jon: REALLY.
IF YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER, A COMEDIAN, A CAMERA PERSON, IF YOU WANT TO START A BUSINESS.
Jon: THOSE ARE THEORETICAL I'M TALKING ABOUT PRACTICE.
THEY ARE ACTUAL. FOR US THE VISION WE HAVE IS ACTUAL LEGISLATION THAT MAKES LIFE BETTER FOR PEOPLE WAS OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUTURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. THAT WOULD BE A WEB SITE THAT DIDN'T WORK IS APPALLING, SO SHAMEFUL. SO I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT THE PUBLIC DOES BUT IT IS GETTING BETTER.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I GUESS TO BACK THAT UP, THE POINT IS IF YOU HAVE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT. ONE SCHOOL IS THOUGHT IS GOVERNMENTS HAVE A ROLE IN OUR LIVES TO HELP IMPROVE THINGS AND WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLES' LIVES. GIVEN THAT THE OTHER IS IT REALLY ISN'T. AND THE GROUP THAT MAKES THAT ARGUMENT WHEN THEY EXECUTE THAT PLAN --
IT SHOULD WORK. EXACTLY. NO, AGAIN.
Jon: FOR INSTANCE, ARE THERE THINGS IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS? HAS THE REGULATION BECOME SO ONEROUS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN NO LONGER BE AGILE ENOUGH TO TACKLE THE PROGRAMS?
LET ME SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS IS A PROCUREMENT PROCESS. EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT THAT. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS WEB SITE NOT TO WORK. THERE'S NO EXCUSE. THOSE WHO WORKED THE HARDEST TO MAKE SURE WE HAD HEALTH CARE, BUT IT WILL WORK AND THE POLICY IS SOLID.
Jon: BUT THERE'S CLEARLY SOMETHING SYSTEMIC GOING ON THAT IS MAKING THE V.A. UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE BACKLOG. TO MAKE US UNABLE TO DEAL. OBAMA'S IT GUY, HE'S CLEARLY A BRILLIANT GUY, HE ARRANGED ALL OF OBAMA'S INTERNET CAMPAIGN STUFF. HE WOULD FIND YOU, YOU WOULD BE IN THE BATHTUB AND YOU WOULD GET AN E-MAIL. IT WOULD BUBBLE OUT OF THE WATER,  HEY, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GIVING US MONEY.
CLASSIFY THOSE WHO BATHE. THEY KNOW WHAT WE DO.
Jon: THAT GUY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE PROCESS. HE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO BID FOR THAT CONTRACT. HE SAID IT WAS A 300-PAGE DOCUMENT. AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S OBSCURED LIKE THAT PURPOSEFULLY SO THAT THE LARGER COMPANIES HAVE AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TEAMS OF LAWYERS AND THINGS THAT CAN DO IT.
DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR. THERE'S NO EXCUSE.
Jon: SURE.
ALL THAT IS -- OKAY.
Jon: I'M NOT PRESENTING IT AS AN EXCUSE. I'M PRESENTING IT AS DO WE HAVE A FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM. DO WE HAVE CORRUPTION IN THE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO GIVE US THE CONFIDENCE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE CAN EXECUTE THE PROGRAMS BETTER.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S CORRUPTION. THERE MAY BE A RISK AVERSION WITH GOING WITH THE KNOWN AND NOT BEING ENTREPRENEURIAL ENOUGH TO SAY -- QUESTION WHETHER IT'S REALLY GOING TO DO THE JOB. I WOULD SAY THIS IN TERMS OF THE BACKLOG AT THE V.A., AGAIN HORRIBLE BUT BEING ADDRESSED. AND THE FACT THAT THE V.A.'S COMPUTERS CAN'T TALK TO THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT TO GET THE INFORMATION.
Jon: SEEMS INSANE.
STUNNING BUT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. OKAY, OKAY.
Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT TO YOU. [LAUGHTER] I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO SAY THAT TO YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THERE SOMETHING -- THIS IS A GOOD POINT THOUGH:  IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DISTANCE FROM IT TO SEE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE IN CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES END UP GOING AND BECOME LOBBYISTS AT THE CORPORATIONS. THE CORPORATIONS LOBBY TO GET ARCANE THINGS PUT INTO THE REGULATION THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR SMALL BUSINESS. CAN THE CONGRESS MAYBE NOT SEE THE CORRUPTION INHERENT IN THAT.
THE REVOLVING DOOR IS NOT SO MUCH CONGRESS AS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. ON NSA, NSA THE -- ONE OF THE PEOPLE WAS HIRED THERE WAS FROM A COMPANY THAT --
Jon: SURE.
THEY GOT ALL THE CONTRACTS AND HIRED CONSULTANTS.
Jon: SOME FOLKS FROM YOUR OFFICE HAVE GONE TO WORK FOR BOEING.
I DON'T KNOW THAT.
Jon: I DO. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, WHO? WELL WHO? I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY --
Jon: STICK AROUND. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. WE'RE TALKING TO NANCY PELOSI. WE'RE COMING BACK.
