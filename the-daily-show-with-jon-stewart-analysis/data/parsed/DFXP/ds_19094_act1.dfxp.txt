FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR RAMACHANDRA GUHA. WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GANDHI BUT NOT THE GANDHI YOU KNOW, THE YOUNG GANDHI, BUT RECENTLY ON OUR PROGRAM WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF FUN WITH THE STORY OF THE FELLOW NAMED CLIVE BUNDY, HE'S WHAT YOU CALL A GRAZING FEE DENIER WHO SPARKED AN ARMED STANDOFF WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP HIS COWS ON WELFARE. WELL, MR. BUNDY WHO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT HAD BECOME A BIT OF A HERO TO MANY ON THE RIGHT. BUT IN ALL THE MANY INTERVIEWS MR. BUNDY HAS DONE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA OUTLETS THERE WAS ONE THING HE FORGOT TO MENTION.
I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE MORE THING I KNOW AMOUNT THE NEGRO. I KNOW ABOUT THE NEGRO.
Jon: IN A SURPRISING TWIST. STATE'S RIGHTS, SOVEREIGN CITIZEN CLIVEN BUNDY IS APPARENTLY ALSO A PROFESSOR OF NEGRO STUDIES.
NOW WHAT DO THEY DO, THEY ABORT THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN, THEY PUT THEIR YOUNG MEN IN JAILS, BECAUSE THEY NEVER, THEY NEVER LEARNED HOW TO PICK COTTON.
Jon: I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED HE IS A PROFESSOR AT DUKE UNIVERSITY. DAVID DUKE UNIVERSITY.
AND I'VE OFTEN WONDERED, ARE THEY BETTER OFF AS SLAVES, PICKING COTTON AND HAVING FAMILY LIFE AND DOING DIFFERENT THINGS OR ARE THEY BETTER OFF UNDER GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY?
Jon: WELL, IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION, I GUESS HISTORY WILL BE THE JUDGE. OH, LOOK AT THAT, HISTORY ALREADY DECIDED AND THE ANSWER IS NO. THEY ARE NOT BETTER OFF. THEY ARE BETTER OFF NOW THAN THEY WERE AS SLAVES BECAUSE ANYBODY WOULD BE BETTER OFF THAN AS A SLAVE. WHAT THE -- IF I MAY OFFER A BIT OF ADVICE TO THE TELEVISION OUTLET THAT WAS PROMOTING THIS GENTLEMAN. IT WOULD BE NICE NOT TO SEE THIS ANYMORE.
I GUESS MAYBE I AM A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
Jon: WELL, YES, A BIT LIKE THE FOUNDING FATHERS, BUT THE BIT OF YOU THAT IS LIKE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS IS THE BIT OF THEM WE ARE ASHAMED OF. SO OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T WATCH WHAT I NORMALLY WATCH NEWS WISE, I GUESS I WILL JUST FLIP BACK OVER TO CNN AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE UP TO.
NEXT BREAKING NEWS, THE MOST PROMISING LEAD YET, DEBRIS WASHING UP ON AN AUSTRALIAN BEACH, TONIGHT IS IT THE PLANE?
Jon: OH FOR (BLEEP) SAKE!  STILL? [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: THE LAST 100 PIECES OF DEBRIS CNN BREATHLESSLY REPORTED ON WERE NOT THE PLANE. BUT NOW THIS, THIS IS THE PLANE? ALRIGHT. LET'S SKIP AHEAD LITERALLY 24 SECONDS AND GO.
TONIGHT WE BEGIN WITH THE BREAKING NEWS A POTENTIALLY GAME CHANGING NEW QUESTION ALSO IN THE SEARCH OF MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 370, HIGH HOPES THAT A PIECE OF DEBRIS FOUND ON THE SHORE OF AUSTRALIA WAS THE PLANE DASHED JUST MOMENTS AGO.
Jon: YOU ARE TELLING ME THERE WAS BREAKING NEWS THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE PLANE AND IN THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO ROLL YOUR THEME SONG YOU FOUND OUT BREAKING NEWS. NO IT IS NOTHING. THE WORST PART IS YOU KNOW CNN WAS LIKE GREAT JOB, EVERYBODY, WE SCOOPED EVERYBODY ON THE PLANE DEBRIS STORY AND THEN WE SCOOPED THEM AGAIN WHEN IT WAS NOTHING!  THAT'S HOW YOU RUN A NEWS NETWORK.
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE WORTH COVERING.
THE NEW U.N. REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE IS FULL OF SERIOUS WARNINGS AND PREDICTIONS OF WHAT IS TO COME.
INTENSE HEAT WAVES THAT FEED FIRES, WIPING OUT FORESTS AND HOMES. PROLONGED DRAUGHTS THAT DAMAGE FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
Jon: I MEAN SURE, BUT THAT IS JUST PBS, I MEAN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE U.N. REPORT THAT STATED THAT WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE. BUT THAT, ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE SOMETHING. IT IS NO WHEEL OF FLOTSAM LIKE THEY ARE REPORTING ON CNN BUT IN FACT THE DAY THE REPORT DROPPED ON CLIMATE CHANGE, FOX AND NBC DEVOTED AROUND 22 MINUTES OF COVERAGE TO IT, FOX MOSTLY TO DEBUNK IT AND MSNBC TO SEE HOW IT AFFECTED HILLARY'S CHANCE OF BECOMING PRESIDENT. BUT, CNN CLOCKED IN AT TWO MINUTES, TECHNICALLY TWO MINUTES AND TEN SECONDS, I GUESS CNN IS ONLY INTERESTED IN WHAT IS FLOATING IN THE WORLD'S OCEANS. CNN, DON'T YOU THINK THIS IS ACTUAL MEANINGFUL NEWS AND COULD FIT VERY WELL INTO YOUR UNNECESSARY OVER DRAMATIC HOLOGRAM ROOMS, VIRTUAL REALITY RIDES AND RANDOM STREET YELLING?  YOU CAN'T USE YOUR HOLO-DECK GREEN SCREEN ROOM TO TALK ABOUT GLOBAL WARNING. JASON JONES, SHOW THEM HOW IT IS DONE.
THANK YOU, JON. I'M OUT HERE IN THE STATE OF THE ART STIMULATION OF WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE WHEN WE ARE ALL BOILING IN THE WORLD'S RISING OCEANS.
Jon: JASON, YOU ARE IN A HOT TUB, JASON. YOU ARE IN A HOT TUB.
OH YEAH, IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK? WELL, CHECK THIS OUT. HOLO-DECK OFF.
BEST GRAPHIC TEAM IN THE BUSINESS. THEY WERE EVEN ABLE TO HIDE THIS PING-PONG BALL I ALWAYS WEAR ON MY CROTCH FOR PLEASURE, IT'S FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF SPECIAL EFFECT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. IT MAKES MY (BLEEP) HUGE.
Jon: ALRIGHT, THANK YOU. I AM GLAD I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT. CNN, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE THAT MUCH AS PART OF YOUR MONTH AND A HALF LONG BREATHLESS PLANE SEARCH YOU ALREADY HAVE MARTIN SAVIDGE UNDERWATER TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT IT IS LIKE UNDER WATER. YOU CAN EASILY REPURPOSE THAT FOR GLOBAL WARMING COVERAGE.
MARTIN SAVIDGE, WHAT WOULD THE VISIBILITY BE LIKE IF WE WERE ALL UNDER WATER DUE TO CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE VISIBILITY HERE REALLY IS VERY, VERY LIMITED.
Jon: THANKS, MARTIN. STAY DOWN THERE FOR ANOTHER FEW WEEKS. I MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU. AND CNN, HOW ABOUT YOUR BOSTON MANHUNT COVERAGE WHEN YOU SENT YOUR FINEST REPORTERS INTO THE STREETS TO SHOUT AND POINT AT (BLEEP).
GUYS, YOU HAVE TO COME TO US. LISTEN, OKAY. THAT IS AT LEAST THE THIRD CANINE DOG THAT BEGAN BARKING, BARKING VERY, VERY LOUDLY, SO THEY MAY BE SMELLING WHAT WE -- WHAT WE THOUGHT WE SMELLED.
Jon: CNN. YOUR PLACE FOR WHAT A DOG SOMEWHERE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE SMELLING. WHY CAN'T YOU GIVE CLIMATE CHANGE THE SAME TREATMENT.
JON, JON, JON, OVER HERE, CUT TO ME. I SAW A FAT KID EATING ICE CREAM AND MAYBE BECAUSE IT IS HOT OUT AND MAY BE BECAUSE HE IS FAT. WE DON'T KNOW.
JON, I'M HERE ON THE WEST SIDE, THE APOCALYPSE MAY HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED. THERE ARE DOGS HERE. I SEE NOTHING BUT DOGS, THEY MAY BE TRYING TO FORM THEIR OWN DOG GOVERNMENT, I DON'T KNOW.
COME BACK TO ME. COME BACK TO ME, I DEFINITELY SMELL BREAD, OKAY, THE SMELL IS EVERYWHERE. IT COULD BE A SEIZURE, IT COULD BE PLOTIZA.
JON, AS THE DAY PROGRESSES TEMPERATURES ARE DEFINITELY GETTING WARMER. IT IS HOTTER THAN IT WAS WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING.
WAIT, COME BACK TO ME RIGHT NOW. IS IT LIVE?  AM I ON?  OKAY. DAMN IT. I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY (BLEEP).
I HAVE JUST RECEIVED A TWEET HERE, SORRY, IT IS A SNAPCHAT AND IT LOOKS LIKE A PING-PONG BALL SURROUNDED BY HAIR. OH, SORRY, JOHN, YES, LOT OF ACTIVITY STILL HAPPENING OUT HERE.
Jon: THANK YOU, GUYS. YOU SEE, CNN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND RESOURCES ON HYPERBOLIC UNNECESSARY RIDICULOUS STUNT COVERAGE OF SPECULATIVE NONSTORIES YOU CAN WASTE YOUR TIME AN RESOURCES ON HYPERBOLIC AND RIDICULOUS COVERAGE OF REAL STORIES TOO. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [ APPLAUSE ]
