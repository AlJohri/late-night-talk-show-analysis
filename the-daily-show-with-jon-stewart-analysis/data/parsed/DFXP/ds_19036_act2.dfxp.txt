Jon: WELCOME BACK. WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS, LEWIS BLACK CATCHES IT FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL "BACK IN BLACK." ♪
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD THE FUTURE WAS GOING TO BE AWESOME. I'D BE JUMPING OVER HELICOPTERS WITH MY JET PACK. I'D HAVE GLASSES THAT WOULD LET ME SEE THROUGH GIRLS' DRESSES AND WE WOULD ALL HAVE FLYING CARS THAT FOLD UP INTO A BRIEFCASE. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY CAR. NOW IT'S JUST A THING THAT HOLDS MY CIGARETTES AND SEX TOYS AND I'M ALL OUT OF CIGARETTES. [LAUGHTER] IT'S 2013, YOU THINK WE WOULD BE UP TO OUR NECKS IN AMAZING TECHNOLOGY BUT INSTEAD THIS IS APPARENTLY THE BEST WE CAN DO.
THE 3-D PRINTED ROBOT THAT COULD BE A COMPLETE GAME CHANGER FOR THE WHOLE INDUSTRY. OH, IT CAN TWERK, TOO.
OMG, IT CAN TWERK. WELL, THEN I'LL TAKE SEVEN OF THEM. I MEAN YOLO, RIGHT, KIDS? NOW, COME ON, TWERK THAT HOT ROBOT ASS.
CAN HE MOVE FOR US REAL QUICK BEFORE WE RUN OUT OF TIME? ♪  [LAUGHTER]
LOOK, IF I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING TRY TO DANCE AND FALL FLAT ON ITS FACE, I DON'T NEED A ROBOT, ALL I NEED IS A FIFTH OF SCOTCH, SOME MUSIC AND A MIRROR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT MAYBE THE BEST SIGN THAT WE'RE DOING A CRAPPY JOB OF INNOVATING IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE BIGGEST TECHNOLOGY STORY OF THE YEAR.
THESE ARE OCTOCOPTERS. THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY DRONES BUT THERE'S NO REASON THEY CAN'T BE USED AS DELIVERY VEHICLES.
REALLY, BECAUSE I CAN THINK OF EIGHT RAZOR SHARP REASONS THEY CAN'T BE USED AS DELIVERY VEHICLES. OH, GOOD, MY NEW WAFFLE MAKER IS HERE. OW! MY HANDS. [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON, TECHNOLOGY, THIS IS THE FUTURE THAT SEVERAL DIFFERENT DOCTORS TOLD ME I WASN'T GOING TO LIVE TO SEE. GIVE ME SOMETHING WORTH WAITING FOR.
SOME SAY IT'S A NEW BREED OF CRIME FIGHTING MACHINE.
OKAY, NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
THIS IS A CRIME -- IT'S MORE OF A CRIME PREVENTION ROBOT. IT ELIMINATES THAT NIGHT WATCHMAN DUTY. > YOU MEAN THE GUY IN EVERY MOVIE WHO FALL ASLEEP ON HIS JOB? YOU NEED A ROBOT FOR THAT? I WANT ROBO COP AND ALL YOU ARE GIVING ME IS PAUL BLART, MALL I WANT ROBO COP AND ALL YOU ARE GIVING ME IS PAUL BLART, MALL ROOMBA.
TIRED OF WRITING THANK YOU LETTERS, WHY NOT GET A ROBOT TO DO IT FOR YOU.
PERFECT A ROBOT THAT DOES SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE STOPPED DOING 30 YEARS AGO. WILL IT ALSO ORGANIZE MY 8-TRACK COLLECTION? CLEARLY THE FUTURE I WAS HOPING FOR JUST HAS NOTHING FOR ME.
ACCORDING TO A PAIR OF NEW ZEALAND RESEARCHERS SEX ROBOTS ARE THE FUTURE OF PROSTITUTION. [  APPLAUSE  ]
ON SECOND THOUGHT, I MIGHT NEED THAT ROBOT TO WRITE ME A THANK YOU NOTE AFTER ALL. JON?
