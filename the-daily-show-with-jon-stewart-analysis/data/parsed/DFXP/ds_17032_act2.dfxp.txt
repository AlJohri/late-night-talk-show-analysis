Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE iPHONE, THE iPAD, THEY SEEM LIKE THE PERFECT BABY-SITTERS. ECONOMICAL, ALWAYS AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN'T HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH THEM. (LAUGHTER) BUT DID YOU KNOW THEY COULD ACTUALLY COST YOU MUCH MORE THAN A REAL BABY-SITTER? AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
VIDEO GAMES. FOR YEARS THEY'VE COME UNDER FIRE FOREIGN COURAGING VIOLENCE, PERPETUATING  ETHNIC STEREOTYPES, AND INSPIRING THE FAULTY BELIEF THAT IF YOU GET STUCK BEHIND  A CAR FOR A FEW SECONDS YOUR HEAD WILL REPAIR ITSELF. BUT A NEW ERA OF GAMES HAVE ARRIVED THAT ARE GOOD FOR KIDS.
OUR MOST POPULAR GAME IS CALLED TAP FISH. IT IS A VIRTUAL AQUARIUM. AND YOU HAVE TO GO IN AND FEED YOUR LITTLE VIRTUAL FISH WITH VIRTUAL FISH FOOD.
AND GAME MAKERS ADDED A VALUABLE TWIST THAT PARENTS LOVE.
TRADITIONALLY YOU HAD TO GO TO THE STORE AND BUY A $60 CARTRIDGE IN ORDER TO PLAY. THIS NEW MODEL YOU CAN PLAY GAMES FOR FREE.
WOW, FREE. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY TAP FISH HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED 20 MILLION TIMES.
GAMES LIKE TAP FISH ARE VALUABLE TO CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO IN AND TAKE  CARE OF THE FISH, IF THEY DON'T, THE FISH WILL DIE. AND THEN ONCE THEY DIE, THAT'S IT. WITH A VIRTUAL FISH TANK YOU CAN REVIVE FISH. BUT IT COST MONEY TO REVIVE THE FISH. SO THAT'S A GOOD LESSON FOR KIDS. IF YOU KILL SOMETHING, YOU CAN THROW MONEY AT IT, TO BRING IT BACK TO LIFE.
WELL, THAT'S HOW THE GAME WORKS.
OH SO, IT TURNS OUT THESE GAMES ARE FREE UNTIL YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO SUCK. AT WHICH POINT KIDS CAN SIMPLY PUSH THIS BUTTON AND INSTANTLY CHARGE $100 WORTH  OF BETTER FISH TO AN iTUNES ACCOUNT AND NOBODY HAD A BETTER AQUARIUM THAN THE  BETTER RAM KIDS OF MOUNT PELLIER, VERMONT.
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THEM PLAYING A FREE GAME LIKE THIS AND NEXT THING I  KNOW THEY SPENT OVER $1500 BUCKS FOR CRAP DIGITAL FISHIES.
YOU SPENT OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS PLAYING TAP FISH?
THAT WAS ALL HE HAD.
ACTUALLY, I MIGHT HAVE GONE OVER --
SO YOU MAXED OUT THE CREDIT CARD.
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?  YEAH.
Reporter: EVEN THOUGH AN INTERVENTION HAS BEEN STAGED FOR THESE KIDS, TAP FISH IS  STILL PULLING IN A MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH.
YOU PROVIDE A PRODUCT, THE FIRST ONE IS FREE. AND THEN AS THEY GET MORE ACCUSTOMED TO YOUR PRODUCT, THE PRICE RISES.
YES.
SO YOU ARE A DRUG DEALER.
NO, WE'RE NOT LIKE A DRUG DEALER. I MEAN WE'VE HAD MANY PARENTS E-MAIL US, TELL US THAT THIS GAME IS TEACHING  THEIR KIDS RESPONSIBILITY. WE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO A PARENT WHOSE KID LOVES YOUR GAME. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE?
WOULD I BE WILLING TO TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE.
TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE, RIGHT NOW.
WE-- I WOULD RATHER HANDLE THESE THINGS VIA E-MAIL.
RIGHT, RIGHT, BUT THIS PARENT JUST WANTS TO LIKE TALK TO YOU. HOLD ON, I'M GOING TO PUT YOU-- MICHAEL?
YES.
HI. OKAY, SO ARE YOU ON WITH THE C.E.O. OF TAP FISH.
YOU PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES. I THINK IT IS OUTRAGEOUS.
AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT 20 MINUTES THEY NEVER DID EXCHANGE E-MAILS.
DO THESE GAMES TARGET KIDS?
I WOULDN'T SAY WE NECESSARILY TARGET KIDS.
YOU CAN STILL PLAY OUR GAMES FOR FREE. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE, YOU KNOW-- AND THEN --
KIDS ARE SMARTER THAN YOU THINK.
ARE THEY?
CHILDREN'S BRAINS ARE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED. THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS IMPULSES, IT DOESN'T FULLY DEVELOP UNTIL WE ARE IN OUR LATE 20s. THEY ARE VERY DRAWN TO ANYTHING THAT MOVES. ANYTHING THAT IS COLOURFUL, IF YOU THREATEN DEATH OF ANIMALS, FOR INSTANCE, KIDS ARE GOING TO BE EMOTIONALLY  INVESTED IN THAT AND NOT WANT IT TO HAPPEN.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER MENTAL DEFICIENCIES IN CHILDREN THAT WE CAN PROFIT FROM?
I MEAN THEY ARE LEARNING RESPONSIBILITY. IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF THINGS, THEY GET DIRTY, MESSY, OR THE FISH DIES.
AND BECAUSE KIDS HAVE AN UNDERDEVELOPED FRONTAL CORTEX, THEY WANT TO KEEP  LEARNING HOW TO TAKE CARE OF FISH, RIGHT?
KID DOES LIKE TO LEARN, THAT'S TRUE.
THEY SURE DO.
IF THERE WAS A GAME CALLED MAX OUT YOUR DAD'S CREDIT CARD, WE WOULD HAVE WON.
AND THANKS TO MY COUSIN IN BANGALORE, NOW THERE'S AN APP FOR THAT.
YOU'RE MAXED OUT!
