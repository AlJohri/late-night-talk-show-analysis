[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD, NEW JERSEY REPUBLICAN I BELIEVE HIS NAME IS CHRISTOPHER CHRISTIE FACED AN OUTCRY YESTERDAY AFTER IT WAS REVEALED THAT HIS STAFFERS PURPOSELY TIED UP TRAFFIC FOR DAYS AT THE FORT LEE NEW JERSEY SIDE OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE AS PAYBACK AGAINST THE TOWN'S DEMOCRATIC MAYOR BECAUSE APPARENTLY BEING RIGHT THERE AT THE BRIDGE ISN'T PUNISHMENT ENOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW HOW CHRISTIE ROLLS MY BROTHER. GO BIG OR GO HOME. WELL THIS MORNING HE DID NOT GO HOME.
THE GARDEN STATE'S SECOND MOST IMPORTANT BOSS TOOK THE STAGE AT THE NEW JERSEY STATEHOUSE FOR A SOLD OUT TWO HOUR MARATHON SHOW AND HE PLAYED ALL THE HITS.
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. THE BUCK STOPS AT MY DESK. IT'S EMBARRASSING. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
Jon: THE BUCK STOPS AT MY DESK! [LAUGHTER] AND I SWEAR TO GOD I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS BUCK BEFORE.  [ LAUGHTER ] BUT LET'S GET TO THE FACTS. IF CHRISTIE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE BRIDGE BLOCK WHEN DID HE FIRST HEAR ABOUT IT?
I WAS DONE WITH MY WORKOUT YESTERDAY MORNING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NOW THAT'S IN MY HEAD.
I'M GETTING READY TO GET IN THE SHOWER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL RIGHT HOLD ON. [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? YOU WERE TELLING US HOW YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT...
I GOT A CALL FROM MY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AT ABOUT... 8:50, 8:55 INFORMING ME OF THIS STORY THAT HAD JUST BROKEN ON THE BERGEN RECORD WEB SITE.
Jon: NOW YOU WEREN'T DRIPPING WET... FINE, FINE. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN ANGRY AFTER YOU HEARD THE NEWS. WHAT'D YOU DO?
THIS MORNNG I TERMINATED THE EMPLOYMENT OF BRIDGIT KELLY EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. LATER TODAY I'M GOING TO BE GOING TO FORT LEE, I'VE ASKED TO MEET WITH THE MAYOR TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM PERSONALLY, FACE-TO-FACE, AND ALSO TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE OF FORT LEE IN THEIR TOWN.
Jon: THAT'S EXCELLENT. THAT IS GREAT. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GO -- RUSH-HOUR? ARE YOU GOING UP THERE AT RUSH-HOUR, MAYBE A POLICE ESCORT, A MOTORCADE. I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE YOU SHOULD SKYPE THIS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ONE ASPECT OF THE INCIDENT HAD CLEARLY UPSET THE GOVERNOR THE MOST.
THIS IS NOT TONE I HAVE SET OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN THIS BUILDING. IT'S NOT THE ENVIRONMENT I'VE WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE.
Jon: INTIMIDATION, VENGEANCE, VITRIOL, THAT'S NOT THE TONE. CHRIS CHRISTIE'S DULCET, MELODIC TONE WHO COULD FORGET WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE. LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET HIS TONE JUST RIGHT. NO, THAT'S NOT IT. ♪  GO.
DAMN, MAN, I'M GOVERNOR COULD YOU JUST SHUT UP FOR A SECOND.
Jon: NO, NO THAT'S NOT IT. HOLD ON. ♪  TRY THAT ONE.
DID I SAY ON TOPIC, ARE YOU STUPID?
Jon: NO, NOT YET. JUST HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET. ♪
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, AFTER YOU GRADUATE FROM LAW SCHOOL YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF LIKE THAT IN A COURTROOM YOUR REAR-END'S GOING TO GET THROWN IN JAIL, IDIOT.
Jon: WE'RE GETTING THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
(bleep), OKAY? THAT'S WHAT IT IS. ♪
Jon: I THINK FINALLY FIGURED OUT THE TONE HE HAS SET, F-U SHARP. F-U!! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
