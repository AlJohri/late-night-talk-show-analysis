(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! NOW, IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS, YOU KNOW THAT FORMER SITCOM STAR TURNED MACADAMIA  FARMER ROSEANNE BARR MADE HEADLINES WHEN SHE JOKINGLY CALLED FOR THE BEHEADING OF  ANYONE MAKING OVER $100 MILLION A YEAR WHO WASN'T GIVING SOME BACK. SHE WAS KIDDING! BUT IT DIDN'T SIT WELL WITH A CERTAIN MORNING SHOW.
MY QUESTION IS WHY DO WE CARE WHAT ROSEANNE BARR SAYS? I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY... WHY DO WE GIVE SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THESE CELEBRITIES AND WHAT THEY SAY?
Jon: HEAR, HEAR! I AM SICK TO DEATH OF THESE CELEBRITIES TELLING US WHAT TO THINK ABOUT POLITICS. LET ME JUST FAST FORWARD TO FOX AND FRIENDS MORNING SHOW EXACTLY 1:15. GO.
JOINING US RIGHT NOW TO BREAK DOWN THE 2012 G.O.P. FIELD IS COUNTRY SINGER SUPERSTAR HANK  WILLIAMS, JR.! (AUDIENCE REACTS) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT SHOW JUST SET A NEW WORLD RECORD, 74 MINUTES. THEY'VE NEVER GONE THAT LONG BEFORE. WAIT, BUT THE HANK IS HERE...
YOU REMEMBER THE GOLF GAME THEY HAD, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN?
YEAH.
YOU REMEMBER THE GOLF GAME?
YOU MEAN WHEN JOHN BOEHNER PLAYED GOLF WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA?
OH, YEAH! YEAH. AND BIDEN AND KASICH, YEAH. UH-HUH.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU NOT LIKE ABOUT IT? IT SEEMED TO BE A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR YOU.
COME ON. COME ON. THAT WOULD BE LIKE HITLER PLAYING GOLF WITH NETANYAHU. OKAY? (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: I'M NOT EVEN SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL HE JUST SAID BUT ALL RIGHT, SO HE  MANGLED HIS METAPHORS AND HE'S PRETTY OUT THERE. SO WHAT? HE'S LIKE ROSEANNE. JUST OUT THERE. THEY BOTH MANGLE IT HAD STAR SPANGLED BANNER, THEY BOTH DRUNKENLY MARRIED TOM ARNOLD. (LAUGHTER) I GUESS WE'LL JUST CHALK IT UP AS ANOTHER CASE OF FOX AND  FRIENDS SAYING ONE THING AND DOING ANOTHER, NO HARM, NO FOUL.
ESPN, THE NETWORK THAT CARRIES THE GAME, PULLED THE HANK WILLIAMS, JR., SONG  FOLLOWING HIS CONTROVERSIAL COMMENT.
WHAT? THEY PULLED THE SONG? WE COUNT ON HIM TO GAUGE OUR NATION'S FOOTBALL READINESS! (LAUGHTER) IF ANYTHING, JUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE SLAP ON THE WRIST. MAKE HIM ALSO HEAD TO ESPN 4 AND SING ARE YOU READY FOR ACTUAL FOOTBALL. HANDS AREN'T ALOUD ♪ AND THE PITCH IS JUST RIGHT, ♪ ARSENAL IS PLAYING MANCHESTER UNITED TONIGHT ♪ ARE YOU READY FOR A GAME THAT  WILL PROBABLY END IN A TIE... ♪ BY THE WAY, ESPN, YOU'RE SHOCKED  AT BOCEPHUS' COMMENTS. HE'S BEEN AT ESPN FOR 20 YEARS VSM YOU MET HIM? FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T PUNCTUATE HIS OBAMA/HITLER  METAPHOR WITH "I MEAN (BLEEP)." THIS IS BOCEPHUS, MAN00 HE'S GOT  A SONG ABOUT HOW THINGS WOULD BE BETTER IF THE SOUTH HAD WON. THE GUY FELL 442 FEET OFF A MOUNTAIN, CRACKED OPEN HIS SKULL HE HAD TO HOLD IN HIS OWN BRAIN  AND SURVIVED. WHEN HE TALKS I CAN SMELL THE JACK DANIELS ON HIS BREATH FROM THE TELEVISION. (LAUGHTER) SO DON'T ACT ALL OOH, MY GOODNESS, WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING DOWN HOME AND GRITTY. THAT'S WHAT HE'S THERE FOR. BUT, OF COURSE, ESPN IS NOW ACUTELY AWARE OF THE SOCIETAL IMPACT OF ALL ITS PRESENTERS. MAY I OFFER, ESPN, A "MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL" ALTERNATIVE WHO  RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE HUMMUS KETTLE ON McDOUGAL. PLEASE WELCOME AMY AND AMY P. ♪ ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL ♪ ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL  ♪ VALIANT BOYS ON THE FIELDS OF GREEN ♪ GENTLE GIANTS DON'T BE MEAN  ♪ ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL ♪ IF NOT, WE CAN FIND A MORE  AGREEABLE TIME ♪ (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
