FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BOOM! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." NICE TO SEE YOU. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR REZA ASLAN IS ON THE PROGRAM THIS EVENING. WE'LL PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST NIGHT WITH THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. IF YOU TUNED IN YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THIS HOW THIS, THE 113th CONGRESS IS PERHAPS THE WORST CONGRESS -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- IN THE HISTORY OF NOT JUST THIS NATION -- [LAUGHTER] -- SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD CHECK IN ON WHAT TODAY'S CONGRESSIONAL (bleep)RY WAS WHAT'D THEY DO TODAY? PASS A RESOLUTION DEMANDING PREAPPROVAL OF ALL PRESIDENTIAL HANDSHAKES? [LAUGHTER] REFUSE TO VOTE ON ANYTHING EXCEPT WHETHER TO ADD CRONUTS TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BRUNCH. [LAUGHTER] SITTING AROUND SAYING THAT S SAXBY CHAMBLISS IS AN ACCEPTABLE NAME. IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S JUST NOT OKAY. [LAUGHTER] MY APOLOGIES TO THE CHAMBLISS FAMILY. WHAT IS CONGRESS UP TO? CONGRESS MAY BE READY TO CALL A TRUCE IN THE BUDGET WARS.
A BIPARTISAN BUDGET DEAL HAS BEEN REACHED TO AVOID ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DEAL? DEAL? WHAT TYPE OF WITCHCRAFT IS THIS? DEAL? THE ELDERS HAVE SPOKEN OF SUCH WONDERS BUT I THOUGHT LIKE THE YETI IT BELONGED TO LEGEND. IF THIS BE TRUE, IT BE INCREDIBLE. MAY IT BE? COULD IT IS?
WE HAVE A DEAL. ♪ HALLELUJAH
Jon: THAT'S IT JUST TWO? DO WE HAVE ANY --
ALMOST A HALLELUJAH MOMENT HERE. IT'S NOT THE GRAND BARGAIN MANY WERE HOPING FOR.
Jon: I KNEW IT. SO THE HALLELUJAH FOR THIS MOMENT IS NOT OF THE  HANDEL VARIETY. MORE OF THE LEONARD COHEN VARIETY. THE MELANCHOLY VERSION THEY PLAY AT BENEFIT CONCERTS. OR WHEN SHREK'S WIFE DECIDES TO BECOME HUMAN. THEN THE DONKEY WAS BESIDE HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, MY POINT IS THIS:  THE BUDGET COMPROMISE IS THAT KIND OF MELANCHOLY, HALLELUJAH. BUT STILL GOOD.
IT'S A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. NOT USED TO USING THAT C WORD COMPROMISE.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THOSE (bleep) C-WORDED. [ LAUGHTER ] -- YES, I CAN'T BELIEVE THOSE (bleep) C-WORDED. I HOPE MY MOTHER ISN'T WATCHING. HOW DID THIS DEAL GO DOWN.
REPUBLICAN PAUL RYAN AND PATTY MURRAY ANNOUNCE THEY HAD REACHED A DEAL TUESDAY AFTER TWO MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. THESE TWO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE VISUAL ANALOGS FOR HOW THE TWO SIDES CANNOT SEE EYE TO EYE. THEY ARE A LIFE-SIZE BAR GRAPH OF THE FISCAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THAT'S -- [LAUGHTER] AND -- AND QUITE FRANKLY -- [  APPLAUSE  ] -- IF I MAY BE SO BOLD, THE TWO OF THEM LOOK LIKE ALL MY PROM PICTURES IN REVERSE. [LAUGHTER] SO THE IMPORTANT THING IS -- OH. [ LAUGHTER ] AW, THE JEW FRO. THOSE WERE THE DAYS. LET'S HEAR IT. WHAT DOES THIS DEAL THEY DID DO?
THIS BILL REDUCES THE DEFICIT BY $23 BILLION. IT DOES NOT RAISE TAXES. IT CUTS SPENDING IN A SMARTER WAY.
THE DEAL SETS GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEVELS  JUST OVER $1 TRILLION FOR 2014 AND 2015 RIGHT BETWEEN WHAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WANTED.
Jon: IT TOOK YOU GUYS THREE YEARS AND A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO COME UP WITH I DON'T KNOW WHY DON'T WE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE. EVEN THIS MOST BASIC OFERENCE. COMPROMISES IS TOO MUCH FOR SOME.
I'LL RESERVE JUDGMENT UNTIL WE READ IT. I CAN TELL YOU MY VIEW BASED ON PRESS REPORTING. MY SENSE IS IT WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR AMERICANS TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
Jon: I HAVE NOT READ THIS THING BUT IT IS DESTROYING AMERICA. I'M GOING TO RESERVE MY JUDGMENT BUT IT (bleep) SUCKS. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE EVEN HAD A BUDGET?
THE LAST TIME CONGRESS PASSED AN ACTUAL BUDGET WAS APRIL 29, 2009. THAT WAS 1687 DAYS AGO. BACK THEN A GALLON OF GAS COST A LITTLE MORE THAN $2. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN IN OFFICE JUST 100 DAYS. IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT EASY ON THE NOSTALGIA FRIEND. IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO. JUMP IN THE WAY BACK MACHINE WITH ME AS WE HEAD FOR 2009. TAYLOR SWIFT TOPPED THE CHARTS AS SHE STILL DOES BUT WITH A DIFFERENT ALBUM AND AMERICANS FLOCKED BY THE MILLIONS TO SEE HUGH JACKMAN AS WOLVERINE. UNLIKE THIS YEAR WHEN MILLIONS FLOCKED TO SEE HIM IN "THE WOLVERINE." [LAUGHTER] SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE WE KNEW WHAT COMPROMISE WAS TO FEEL LIKE.
THE DEMOCRATS WEIGHING IN SAYING IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT THEY CAN LIVE WITH IT.
Jon: EXACTLY. IT'S A COMPROMISE. THERE'S NO VICTORY. THERE'S NO SENSE OF GLORY. IT'S LIKE BEING IN A BAR AT LAST CALL. THE LIGHTS COME ON AND YOU LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SAY, WELL, IF WE COULD DO ANY BETTER, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE SO LET'S GO (bleep) BEHIND A SONIC. [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT IN THAT LAUGH THERE WAS A BIT OF A RUEFUL NOTE. WE GO TO SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN --
JON, WHAT A DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOY TO THE WORLD, JON. WHAT AN AMAZING WONDERFUL, GLORIOUS DAY THIS IS HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
Jon: IT'S A GOOD DAY. IT'S NICE.
IT'S WHAT? IT'S NICE, JON? GELATO IS NICE. TOM HANKS IS NICE. TOM HANKS GELATO IS DISGUSTING BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THIS IS  EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
Jon: NOT EVERYTHING.
IT'S THE WHALE JUMPING OVER THE KID AT THE END OF FREE WILLIE AND NOT GETTING A DROP OF WATER ON HIM, JON, NOT A DROP.
Jon: JOHN, THE KID IS GETTING SOAKED.
NOT A DROP OF WATER, JON. IT'S THE DEAL -- IT'S CHARLIE BUCKET INHERITING AN ENTIRE FACTORY FULL OF CHOCOLATE AND SLAVES. [LAUGHTER] WERE EITHER OF THOSE MOMENTS JUST NICE TO YOU, JON?
Jon: IS IT LIKE ET GOING HOME?
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, JON? HOW IS LETTING AN ALIEN ESCAPE WHEN ALL THE SECRETS TO THE UNIVERSE ARE HELD WITHIN HIS ONE EASILY SEVERED FINGER A TRIUMPH. THAT WAS A DISASTER. THINK OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WE LET FLY AWAY.
Jon: IT WAS A MOVIE ABOUT FRIENDSHIP OVERCOMING OBSTACLES.
YOUR WRONG! YOU'RE WRONG. LOOK, JON, MY ARGUMENT HERE -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HE --
WE LET A CHILD LET HIM ESCAPE. YOU ARE WRONG. THE POINT IS, JON. I'M SAYING ON THE SCALE OF MIRACULOUS CONGRESSIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS THIS BUDGET BILL RANKS UP THERE WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND A 90%  INCUMBANCY RATE.
Jon: IT'S A MODEST, A MODEST, LET'S JUST NOT SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT.
JON, YOU ARE NOT RECOGNIZING THE DISTANCE THE TWO SIDES HAD TO TRAVEL TO THAT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY STARTED JUST TWO MONTHS AGO. LET ME READ TO YOU, JON, FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD OF THEIR FIRST MEETING.
Jon: PLEASE. PLEASE DO THIS.
DAY ONE OF NEGOTIATIONS. HEY (bleep). WE START THINGS ON TIME AROUND HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE, PERHAPS THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF WISCONSIN DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I WAS AT HOME (bleep) HIS MOM.
Jon: WHOA.
I KNOW.
Jon: WHOA WHOA.
I KNOW. PATTY MURRAY HAS A MOUTH ON HER, JON. A FILTHY MOUTH.
Jon: THAT'S NOT A PROMISING START.
IT GOT WORSE. HERE IS THE AUDIO FROM DAY FOUR. LISTEN [SCREAMING]
Jon: PRETTY SURE THAT'S FROM TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.
PRETTY SURE YOU'RE WRONG.
Jon: HOW DID THEY ARRIVE AT A DEAL?
LET'S SKIP TO THE END. ON THE LAST DAY RYAN SAID HEY (bleep) HOW DOES A BUDGET OF A TRILLION SOUND AND SAID MAKE IT $1.012 TRILLION AND YOU HAVE A DEAL (bleep) AND SUDDENLY. ♪ COME WITH ME AND YOU'LL SEE A WORLD OF PASSING LEGISLATION ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: DON'T THROW YOUR THINGS. SOMEONE HAS TO CLEAN THAT UP. WILL THERE EVEN BE ENOUGH VOTES FOR THIS?
OH, OH, YES, JON. CONGRESS WILL VOTE FOR THIS IF THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR THEM.
SEVERAL LAWMAKERS TOLD US THEIR WIVES HAVE THREATENED TO LEAVE THEM IF THEY ALLOWED YET ANOTHER CRISIS TO RUIN YET ANOTHER FAMILY CHRISTMAS.
NOW THERE'S A DEAL, JON, ALL THE REPRESENTATIVES HEAD HOME FOR A MERRY TRIPLE X-MASS. THERE'S A LOT OF STOCKINGS BEING STUFFED, JON. I'M TALKING ABOUT A (bleep) FEST, JON.
Jon: WE UNDERSTAND THAT.
