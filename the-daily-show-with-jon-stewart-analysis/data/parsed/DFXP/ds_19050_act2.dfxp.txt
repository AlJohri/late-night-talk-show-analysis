WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION PAID RECENTLY TO THE MISTREATMENT OF OUR RETURNING WAR VETERANS. ONE GROUP HAS AVOIDED THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TREATED AT ALL.
JASON JONES REPORTS ON THE CHALLENGES FACING THE VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM WAR.
WHEN VIETNAM VETS RETURNED HOME THEY WERE OSTRACIZED, CALLED UNSPEAKABLE THINGS, EVEN SPIT ON. SADLY THAT CONTINUES TODAY.
IT HAS BEEN HELL.
WE ARE STIGMATIZED AND EXCLUDED.
THE VETERAN IS LIKE A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN.
LET ME GUESS THE PROBLEM HERE, HIPPIES. WHAT DO YOU SAY,  DO YOU WANT TO GO BEAT SOME UP?
NO.
TRUST ME YOU SMACK THEM AROUND WITH A BASEBALL BAT THEY AREN'T GOING TO THINK IT'S SO GROOVY.
IT'S NOT THE HIPPIES. SO WHO ARE YOU ANGRY WITH?
I'M ANGRY WITH THE MILITARY.
I'M MAD AT THE MILITARY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING THROUGH POST TRAUMATIC STRESS AND THE MILITARY HAS TURNED THEIR BACKS ON US.
IT'S ESTIMATED 500,000 VETS GOT PTSD IN VIETNAM YET HUNDREDS GOT OF THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE INELIGIBLE FOR TREATMENT WHICH RAISES A FASCINATING QUESTION:   WHAT THE (bleep)?
A BAD DISCHARGE.
A BAD DISCHARGE PROHIBITS US FROM BEING ELIGIBLE FOR A LOT OF THINGS WE WOULD NORMALLY BE ENTITLED TO.
SO HOW EXACTLY DID YOU GET THAT LESS THAN HONORABLE DISCHARGE?
PTSD WE GOT IN VIETNAM.
I GUESS MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE:  ARE YOU (bleep)  SERIOUS?
MOST DEFINITELY SERIOUS.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:  THESE GUYS WENT TO VIETNAM?
THAT'S CORRECT.
WHERE THEY GOT TO PTSD.
YES.
WHICH LED TO THEM GETTING LESS THAN HONORABLY DISCHARGED.
MOST DEFINITELY.
NOW THEY CAN'T GET TREATMENT FOR THEIR PTSD ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISCHARGE THEY GOT FROM VIETNAM.
THAT'S CORRECT.
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A MILITARY TERM FOR THAT. OH, AND ONE OTHER THING:  THE MILITARY SAYS VIETNAM VETS COULDN'T HAVE HAD PTSD IN THE 70s BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T OFFICIALLY DIAGNOSE IT UNTIL THE 80s BASED OFF OF STUDIES OF, WAIT FOR IT -- VIETNAM VETS. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET PTSD FROM AN INTERVIEW?
THERE'S A LOT OF ANGER THERE.
IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING YOU ARE GOING TO EXPLODE.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO PUNCH AND KICK.
LET ME TRY THAT. [YELLING]
HEY, MAN, YOU GOTTA CHILL  [GRUNTING]
YEAH, THAT DIDN'T WORK.
YEAH, I STILL FEEL REALLY ANGRY. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, I WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET.
EXCUSE ME. [GASPS]
DON'T HURT ME.
OKAY THIS BROOM CLOSET WAS NOT HELPING BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD. LAWYERS FROM THE YALE LAW SCHOOL FILED A CLASS ACTION SUIT ON THE VETS BEHALF. THIS WAS DEFINITELY GOING TO GET ME OUT OF THIS PATHETIC STATE. THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS SITUATION. WE'VE SEEN MANY CASES WHERE RECORDS JUST AREN'T AVAILABLE AND THE MILITARY SAYS, WELL THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF PTSD FROM THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT THE MILITARY LOST.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THIS INTERVIEW ANYMORE. READ THESE GLIB INSENSITIVE QUESTIONS YOURSELF.
IS PTSD ONE OF THOSE MADEUP DISEASES LIKE PEANUT ALLERGIES? EVERY KID IN MY SON'S CLASS HAS A PEANUT ALLERGY. WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
I MEAN, IT'S A GOOD TAG BUT I'M NOT LAUGHING.
OF COURSE THE VETS DO HAVE ONE SIMPLE RECOURSE.
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS GET THESE DISCHARGES UPGRADED.
IT'S EASY ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS GET THE D.O.D. TO RECOGNIZE THE DISEASE ACTUALLY EXISTED BEFORE 1980.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THEIR LESS THAN HONORABLE DISCHARGES WERE ACTUALLY HONORABLE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
OH, AND THEN THEY JUST NEED TO FILL OUT 600 DIFFERENT FORMS ON TOP OF THAT. EASY PEASY LEMON SQUEEZY.
IT'S A NIGHTMARE. I'VE BEEN 13 YEARS TRYING TO GET ALL THE PAPERWORK INTO THEM TO GET MY UPGRADE AND THEN SOMEBODY MARKED DISAPPROVED.
HOW DO YOU KEEP GOING?
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING OVER 40 YEARS AND I'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT.
IF THESE GUYS COULD FIGHT FOR 40 YEARS, I COULD GET OUT OF MY DISGUSTING BATHROBE AND TRAIN THEM MYSELF IN BUREAUCRATIC WARFARE.
EVERY SPACE, EVERY LINE, EVERY BOX WILL BE FILLED IN  WITH METICULOUS DETAIL. IF THERE WAS ANYBODY COURAGEOUS ENOUGH FOR THIS UNBEARABLE MISSION, IT'S THESE GUYS. AND NOW FOR THE HARDEST PART OF YOUR MISSION, THAT'S CALLED WAITING. GUNS AND AMMO FOR YOU AND A VANITY FAIR FOR YOU BECAUSE IT'S ALL WE HAD IN THE LOBBY. NOW LET ME SEE YOU WAIT. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO GET ITS HEAD OUT OF ITS ASS. JASON JONES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
