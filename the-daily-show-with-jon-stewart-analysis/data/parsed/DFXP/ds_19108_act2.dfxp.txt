Jon: MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO... (LAUGHTER) -- THE DINOSAURS BECAME EXTINCT. I MEAN, 6,000 YEARS AGO. LUCKILY, WE HUMANS ARE SMARTER. NOT SMART ENOUGH TO STOP IT, BUT SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW ABOUT IT IN ADVANCE. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT. HUMAN EXTINCTION WATCH:  YOU TAKE IT FROM HERE APES. (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT WILL ERASE US FROM THE PLANET? OUR FIRST CANDIDATE, PESTILENCE.
THE DEADLY MERS VIRUS THAT CAUSES RESPIRATORY AND KIDNEY PROBLEMS IS SPREADING WORLDWIDE.
MERS OR MIDDLE EASTERN RESPIRATORY SYNDROME IS A NEW, IMPORTED DISEASE THAT STARTED WITH CAMELS OVERSEAS! (LAUGHTER)
CAMELS! FIRST YOU CONVINCE OUR CHILDREN THAT CIGARETTES ARE COOL, AND NOW THIS? (LAUGHTER) SO ON A SCALE OF ZERO TO "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE", HOW CONTAGIOUS IS THIS MERS THING?
WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH INVESTIGATORS HERE AT THE CDC WHO ARE TRACKING THIS, AND THEY UNDERLINE THAT THIS HAS SPREAD THROUGH EXTENDED CONTACT.
Jon: IT'S EXTENDED CONTACT. OKAY, OKAY.
THE CDC SAY AN ILLLINOIS MAN GOT THE VIRUS FROM AN INDIANA HEALTHCARE WORKER WHO BROUGHT IT FROM THE MIDDLE EAST. THEIR ONLY PHYSICAL CONTACT, A HANDSHAKE.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? SINCE WHEN DOES A HANDSHAKE COUNT AS "EXTENDED CONTACT"? YOU BETTER TELL ME THEY WERE SHAKING HANDS IN THANKS FOR THE BLOWJOBS THEY JUST GAVE EACH OTHER. I MUST SAY, MR. PETERSON, THAT WENT EXCEEDINGLY WELL. YES, MR. JOHNSON, WONDERFUL FELLATING. SAY HELLO TO THE WIFE! YES, SAY HELLO TO THE -- ALL RIGHT. LISTEN -- (LAUGHTER) HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WEREN'T GIVING EACH OTHER ICE CREAM? SO I GUESS THIS IS IT. WE'RE TAKING THE MERS TRAINING TO EXTINCTION TOWN, POPULATION US --
OFFICIALS SAY THE ORLANDO PATIENT IS CURRENTLY IN GOOD CONDITION.
THEY HAVE CONTACTED ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE FLIGHT WITH THAT PATIENT, AND THEY ARE ALL FINE.
IT MIGHT BE MORE TREATABLE THAN WE HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE..
SHOULD AMERICANS BE WORRIED AT ALL?
YOU KNOW, NO.
Jon: OH, SO THIS MERS THING IS LESS THE PANDEMIC FROM CONTAGION AND MORE YOU'VE GOT MAIL HEAD COLD SITUATION. I GUESS IF EARTH IS GOING TO WIPE US OUT, SHE WILL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY.
SCIENTISTS WARN A LARGE PART OF ANTARCTICA IS MELTING AND CANNOT BE STOPPED.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING. HOW DO WE REALLY KNOW IT'S NOT APOCALYPTIC?
WE'RE PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN. THE SCIENCE IS REAL, IT IS RUE.
Jon: OH MY GOD, WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! YOU KNOW IT'S SERIOUS IF SOMEONE ON FOX NEWS JUST SAID "CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL"! I BELIEVE THAT IS A SIGN OF THE APOCALYPSE! (APPLAUSE) I BELIEVE THAT MAY BE A QUOTE FROM REVELATIONS! AND LO, A PALE ANCHOR FROM FOX, WOULD SPEAKETH THE CLIMATE TRUTH. AND THEN THE SEAS WOULD PART, SWALLOWING UP THE PEOPLE... (LAUGHTER) THE BIBLE GETS HIGH-PITCHED WHEN IT GETS LIKE THAT. HOW FLOODY WILL THESE RISING SEA LEVELS GONNA GET?
A 10-FOOT RISE IN SEA LEVEL WOULD SUBMERGE TUNNELS AND SUBWAYS HERE IN MANHATTAN AND PARTS OF QUEENS AND BROOKLYN
Jon: NEW YORK DOESN'T NEED SUBWAYS, NOT WITH THE NEW CITI BOAT PROGRAM. THAT LOOKS FUN. I'M ALREADY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS SEA LEVEL EXTINCTION.
THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. WE'RE TALKING PROBABLY 200 TO 500 YEARS BEFORE THE WHOLE THING GOES.
Jon: OH. WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO KNOW ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) GOT ANY GLOBAL CATASTROPHES THAT COULD AFFECT ME?
FIGHTING WORDS FROM THE MANAGER OF THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES. RYNE SANDBERG SAYS HE CAME DOWN WITH FOOD POISONING AND LOST 6 POUNDS IN TWO DAYS, THIS AFTER EATING ONE OF THE SHAKE SHACK BURGERS OVER THE WEEKEND IN QUEENS.

IF THAT'S THE CASE IT DID NOT COME FROM THE CITI FIELD LOCATIONS. SO SHAKE SHACK OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHATS HAPPENING HERE.

APPARENTLY AFTER YEARS OF CHOKING DOWN WASTE BEEF TRIMMINGS COATED IN LIQUID CHEESE THE FLORA IN SANDBERG'S TUM TUM COULDN'T HANDLE "ACTUAL" FOOD. WHAT'S A MATTER, HALL OF FAME SECOND BASEMAN RYNE SANDBERG WHOSE ATHLETIC CAREER AND INTEGRITY HAVE NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED? YOU'D RATHER HAVE ONE OF THESE?  HUH? IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE? YEAH! WHAT KIND OF CITY TAKES THE PARTS OF THE COW NORMAL PEOPLE THROW AWAY, FRIES IT UP ON A HUNK OF BREAD AND BEFORE THEY CAN CALL IT THEIR SIGNATURE DISH ASKS DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT WHIZ ON THAT? I'LL TELL YOU, A CITY SO (BLEEP) DUMB, IT USES ITS ART MUSEUM AS EXERCISE EQUIPMENT! YEAH, YOU HEARD ME! A CITY SO, HOLD ON, A CITY SO FAMOUSLY [BLEEP] NO ANIMAL, NO ANIMAL WOULD DEIGN TO ROOT FOR ITS BASEBALL TEAM, FORCING YOU TO GO WITH THIS (BLEEP) UP JIM HENSON REJECT-LOOKING PIECE OF (BLEEP).

A DISH THAT MAKES ITSELF IF YOU LEAVE MILK OUT! YOU DAIRY AISLE DONALD TRUMP (BLEEP)! OKAY, YOU MADE A TOPPING FOR A BAGEL. WHAT DO YOU WANT, A NOBEL PRIZE? SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, THANKS FOR SELLING THESE IN BRICK SHAPE. IN CASE I WANTED TO BUILD MY OWN INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF (BLEEP) CREAM CHEESE. YOU PHILLY PIECE OF (BLEEP). (WHISPERING... ) I ACTUALLY LOVE  THESE. YOU PHILLY PIECE OF (BLEEP) YOU QUIT YOUR WHINING SANDBURG! YOU DON'T WANT DIARRHEA, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T COME TO A TOWN CALLED FLUSHING.
