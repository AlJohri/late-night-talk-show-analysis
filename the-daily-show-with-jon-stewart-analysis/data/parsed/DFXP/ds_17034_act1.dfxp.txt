Jon: DECEMBER 13, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT... I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THE CONVERSATION. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THE CONVERSATION. LAWRENCE LESSIG LAW LEVIATHAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TONIGHT WE BEGIN WITH A... LIKE MOST AMERICANS, TELEVISION, I ENJOY IT. WHETHER IT'S MAD MEN, "BOARD WALK EMPIRE" OR OUR COMEDY  CENTRAL BREAKOUT HIT "HEY, FART IN THIS." (LAUGHTER) LOVE THOSE GUYS! IN ADDITION TO BEING ENTERTAINED THERE ARE FUN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS ON THE TELLLY... FOR THE U.K. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S AN ENTIRE CHANNEL DEVOTED TO LEARNING CALLED THE LEARNING CHANNEL. (LAUGHTER) IT TEACHES ONE WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE TO HAVE EIGHT CHILDREN. (LAUGHTER) OR 17 CHILDREN. (LAUGHTER) OR 19 CHILDREN. OR JUST ONE HEAVILY MADE UP CHILDREN.
MY NAME'S LORI, MY SON BRAXTON AND MY DAUGHTER ALASKA ARE PAGEANT ROYALTY.
YOU'RE NOT A STRIPPER BUT SHAKE YOUR BUTT A LITTLE BIT.
NOW WHY WOULD YOU EVEN SAY THAT? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BECAUSE, BECAUSE, HONEY, SHE'S A TERRIBLE MOTHER. (LAUGHTER) BUT SOMETIMES THE LEARNING CHANNEL SPLITS UP AND CREATES PROGRAMMING THAT NOT ONLY IS  EDUCATIONAL BUT IS DOWN RIGHT OFFENSIVE.
A REALITY SHOW ABOUT AMERICAN MUSLIMS IS SPARKING CONTROVERSY. AND EVEN CALLS FOR A BOYCOTT TODAY.
Jon: WHAT ARE THEY THINKING? WHO GIVES A JIHADI TERRORIST A SHOW-- I SAY, ASSUMING THAT THAT MUST BE IT. BECAUSE THERE'S A CONTROVERSY. THIS ALL-AMERICAN MUSLIM SHOW MUST BE ABOUT JIHADI PROPAGANDA.
ARE YOU SCARED?
SCARED ABOUT DELIVERING? I'M SCARED ABOUT BEING A MOM.
I GOT A LOT OF MY MIND WORRY ABOUT THE WHOLE PREGNANCY. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING THROUGH ALL THE PHYSICAL, THE MENTAL, I  FEEL LIKE I'M GOING THROUGH A LOT OF IT. (LAUGHTER) SERIOUSLY? THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN INTERESTING TO HEAR EVEN IF THAT GUY WAS BUILDING A BOMB AS HE  WAS TALKING! (LAUGHTER) THAT IS THE MOST BORING REALITY SHOW IMAGINABLE. IT SEEMS TO JUST SHOW MUSLIMS LIVING THEIR LIVES. LIKE THE REST OF US (BLEEP)ING IDIOTS. (LAUGHTER) SO WHY DID THE GROUP THAT COMPLAINED, THE FLORIDA FAMILY ASSOCIATION ORFFA, WHY DID THEY  HAVE A PROBLEM?
WHAT SCENES IN THE SHOW TO QUOTE YOU ADVANCE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM. WHAT SCENES DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH?
IT'S THE ABSENCE OF THE RADICAL SIDE OF THE IMAMS PROPOSITION OF SHARIA LAW THAT  IS MOST CONCERNING. IT'S THE ABSENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF ISLAM I CAN COATS.
Jon: THE PROBLEM WITH THE SHOW IS THE ABSENCE OF RADICALISM? THE PROBLEM IS THE TELEVISING OF MUSLIMS WITHOUT THE TERRORIST ELEMENT? (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT THAT. LIKE WHEN "TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL" WAS FORCED TO INTRODUCE THE ABORTION CLINIC BOMBER CHARACTER. (LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGHLY SAY THIS, I THOUGHT IT WAS JERRY VAN DYKE'S DARKEST  MOST INTRIGUING ROLE. (LAUGHTER) WHY WOULD YOU BE UPSET TO LEARN THAT THERE ARE NON-JIHADI MUSLIMS?
THIS PROGRAM CREATES AN IMAGE THAT'S HARMFUL EDUCATION WISE TO  THE BELIEF STRUCTURE AND MEMORIES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO WILL LOOK AT THIS  AND SAY "WELL, ALL MUSLIMS ARE LIKE THAT" WHEN IT'S NOT ACCURATE.
Jon: THIS SHOW IS HARMFUL EDUCATION WISE TO YOUR BELIEF STRUCTURE. (LAUGHTER) IS THAT NOT THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION? VIS-A-VIS BELIEF STRUCTURES? (LAUGHTER) TO REPLACE YOUR BELIEF STRUCTURE WITH FACTS? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T LIKE THE... I DON'T LIKE  THE SHOW "NOVA" BECAUSE IT IS HARMFUL TO MY BELIEF STRUCTURE THAT THE OCEAN TIDES ARE  CONTROLLED BY MONSTERS. (LAUGHTER) THE BALLS ON THIS GUY. THIS SHOW CHALLENGES THE STEREOTYPE I HAVE ABOUT MUSLIMS. SO I GUESS I COULD NO LONGER ACCEPT THAT STIR OWE TYPE OR, IF IT PLEASE IT IS COURT, YOU COULD  JUST REPLACE THESE MUSLIMS WITH ONES THAT MORE APTLY FIT MY NARROW VIEW. I'M ALSO TROUBLED WHY NO ONE ON YOUR SHOW "LITTLE PEOPLE BIG  WORLD" WHISTLES WHILE THEY WORK. OR MAKES CANDY FOR WILLY WONKA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SINCERELY, YOUR FRIENDS AT FFAFFA. (LAUGHTER) WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? ANY IDIOT CAN WRITE A LETTER. SOME FRINGE GROUP. WHO CARES?
HOME IMPROVEMENT CHAIN LOWE'S IS FACING A BACKLASH AFTER PULLING ADS FROM A REALITY  TELEVISION SHOW ABOUT AMERICAN MUSLIMS.
LOWE'S PULLED A AD AFTER THE FLORIDA FAMILY ASSOCIATION COMPLAINED.
Jon: BUT HAVE YOU HEARD THE COMPLAINT? IT'S RIDICULOUS! THE COMPLAINT IS THE MUSLIMS AREN'T TERRORISTS AND ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS SO I  CAN'T BELIEVE I...
OUR DECISION WAS NOT POLITICAL, IT WAS NOT SOCIAL IN MY WAY. WE JUST KNEW THAT IT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAM AND WE WANTED TO REACH CONSUMERS AND A  CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAM IS NOT A GREAT PLACE TO DO THAT.
Jon: YOU STILL ADVERTISE ON THE LEARNING CHANNEL! THE NETWORK WITH THE SHOW THAT AIR BRUSHES FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRLS LIKE THE SIDE OF A VAN IN JERSEY  AND SENDS THEM TO SASHAY OUT ON THE STAGE LIKE THEY'RE IN A VIDEO. WHAT DO YOU... OH, FOR GOD'S... FOR MORE, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR MUSLIM CORRESPONDENT AASIF MANDVI. AASIF? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AASIF, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. AASIF, SOME GROUP IN FLORIDA COMPLAINS THAT THE MUSLIMS ON "ALL AMERICAN MUSLIMS" ARE TOO  NORMAL AND LOWE'S, THE HOME IMPROVEMENT HARDWARE MEGASTORE PULLS THE HARDWARE FROM THE SHOW. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS?
I'M DISAPPOINTED, JON. I ACTUALLY THINK LOWE'S SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY.
Jon: BUT YOU KNOW, AASIF, CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT BECAUSE THEY PULLED THEIR ADVERTISING...
WHAT? NO, I'M SAYING IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FIGHTING TERROR WE HAVE TO  SHUT DOWN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, I.E., LOWE'S... (LAUGHTER). A.K.A. THE ONE STOP JIHADI SUPERSTORE. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, JON, LET'S JUST CUT THROUGH THE BULL (BLEEP) AND AGREE THAT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. BENT ON WORLD DOMINATION BY VIOLENT MEANS, RIGHT?
Jon: NO! I'M NOT GOING TO... NO, I'M NOT GOING TO AGREE WITH THAT. THAT'S NOT...
THANK YOU. AND WITHOUT THE STORE... (LAUGHTER). WITHOUT THE STORE LOWE'S, THE JIHADISTS' GOAL IS UNACHIEVABLE, JON. IF YOU WERE A MUSLIM WHO WANTS TO BUILD A BOMB... SORRY, I'M OBVIOUSLY BEING REDUNDANT. (LAUGHTER) WHAT WOULD YOU BUILD IT OUT OF?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BUILD BOMBS. WIRING. UM... P.V.C. PIPE, FERTILIZER.
YUP, OR AS THEY CALL IT HERE AISLE 5. (LAUGHTER) JON, LOWE'S IS TO MUSLIM WHAT IS F.A.O. SCHWARZ IS TO NINE-YEAR-OLDS.
Jon: AASIF, ANY HARDWARE STORE CARRIES FERTILIZER AND LUMBER.
RIGHT! BUT IT'S THE DEALS THEY OFFER! BELIEVE ME! WE ARE BUILDING A LOT FEWER VICTORY MOSQUES BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET LUMBER AT A DOLLAR A FOOT. CHECK THIS OUT, LEISURE TIME MONKEY BARS FOR $120? AT THAT PRICE I'M TRAINING THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, COME ON!
Jon: ALL RIGHT, I GET IT. I GET IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TWO FOR ONE DEALS, 100-POUND PROPANE CYLINDERS? I MEAN, COME ON, YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO BLOW SOMETHING UP. THEIR HELPFUL STAFF WILL EVEN LOAD THE TANKS RIGHT INTO YOUR CAR BOMB. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU MEAN CAR. THEY'LL LOAD THEM INTO YOUR CAR.
OH, YEAH, RIGHT. CAR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT LOWE'S IS PATRIOTIC. VERY PATRIOTIC STORE. THEY SELL AMERICAN FLAGS.
YEAH, SURE, TWO AISLES DOWN FROM THE KEROSENE AND GRILL LIGHTERS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YEAH, BUT AASIF I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF REFRESHING MY  KITCHEN'S LOOK WITH A BACK SPLASH. IF LOWE'S SHUTS DOWN WHERE WILL I GET CAULK?
WELL, WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE CAULK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU, I DO. I DO LOVE CAULK. I MEAN, IT'S. ..
BUT, YOU KNOW, JON, I HOPE YOU LOVE FREEDOM MORE.
Jon: MORE THAN CAULK? (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE. OF COURSE I LOVE FREEDOM MORE!
Jon: .
THEN YOU MUST ADMIT THE LOWE'S HOME IMPROVEMENT STORES  ARE DIRECTLY SUPPLYING AMERICA'S ENEMIES WITH THE MEANS THEY NEED  TO BRING DOWN OUR COUNTRY FROM WITHIN! AT UNBELIEVABLY LOW PRICES! (LAUGHTER) AND IF THERE IS ONE THING MUSLIMS LOVE MORE THAN TERROR IT'S A BARGAIN. (LAUGHTER) I'M KIDDING. THERE IS NOTHING MUSLIMS LOVE MORE THAN TERROR. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THANK YOU AASIF. AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
