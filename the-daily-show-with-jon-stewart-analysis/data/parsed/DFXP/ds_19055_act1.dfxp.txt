FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TONIGHT'S GUEST, IT'S A FINE ONE. TONIGHT'S GUEST PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN JOHNNY KNOXVILLE WILL BE JOINING US. LAST NIGHT WASHINGTON, D.C. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA DELIVERED HIS FIFTH STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WITH THE HELP OF CONGRESSIONAL BALL BOUNCERS UNION. WOW THAT IS RIGHT UP TO THE CAMERA. IS THAT WHAT HAVING GOOGLE GLASS SEX LOOKS LIKE. WOW. EVEN THEY COULDN'T KEEP THE ADORING CROWD BACK FROM THE PRESIDENT. LADIES, NO. HE IS NOT A PIECE OF MEAT. NO. LADIES IT'S GOING TO STICK ALL NIGHT. HE HAS TO DO HIS SPEECH! LET THE MAN TELL US THE STATE OF THE UNION. I'VE GOT $5 ON STRONG.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, TODAY IN AMERICA A TEACHER SPENT EXTRA TIME WITH A STUDENT WHO NEEDED IT.
Jon: OH, BOY, STRAP IN, EVERYBODY. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO MENTION EVERYBODY IN AMERICA BY NAME.
AN ENTREPRENEUR FLIPPED ON THE LIGHTS IN HER TECH START-UP. AN AUTO WORKER FINE TUNED SOME OF THE BEST FUEL EFFICIENT CARS IN THE WORLD. A FARMER PREPARED FOR THE SPRING. A MAN TOOK THE BUS HOME FROM THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT BONE TIRED.
Jon: IS HE TALKING TO CONGRESS OR PITCHING HIS INDEPENDENT FILM? DAWN OVER THE PLAINS COULD BE NEBRASKA, OPENING CREDITS, A NURSE STRUGGLES TO LIGHT HER CIGARETTE. CUT TO A HOT DOG VENDOR MIDDLE EASTERN OLD EYES IN A YOUNG FACE. WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT AMERICA NOT AMERICANS.
THE UNITED STATES IS BETTER POSITIONED FOR THE 21ST CENTURY THAN ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH. NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD DOES WHAT WE DO.
Jon: DENY CLIMATE CHANGE. EXPAND GUN RIGHTS, AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, PUT BACON IN ICE CREAM. WE'RE VERY TALENTED. SO THE COUNTRY IS STRONG BUT CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CONGRESS IS HURTING. AS HE SPOKE TO THEM IT WAS CLEAR HE HAD RECENTLY TAKEN A COURSE AT THE LEARNING ANNEX ON PASSIVE AGGRESSION FOR JEWISH MOTHERS.
I INTEND TO KEEP TRYING WITH OR WITHOUT CONGRESS. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO HELP OR HINDER THIS PROGRESS.
Jon: I MEAN I HAVE A LOT TO DO BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HELP OR YOU COULD BE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME. EVEN THOUGH I AT ONE TIME PUSHED YOU THROUGH MY VAGINA. YOU WANT TO LEAVE COLLEGE IS FINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I WANT. OR THE COUNTRY BUT WHAT YOU THE LITTLE PRINCE, THE CENTER OF UNIVERSE. BE A DEAR, GET ME MY INSULIN FROM THE CABINET. I'LL INJECT MYSELF. SERIOUSLY WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO NEXT GUILT US ALL INTO CALLING OUR ACTUAL MOTHERS.
I ASK EVERY AMERICAN WHO KNOWS SOMEONE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE TO HELP THEM GET COVERED BY MARCH 31. KIDS CALL YOUR MOM AND HELP HER THROUGH THE APPLICATION. IT WILL GIVE HER SOME PEACE OF MIND AND PLUS, SHE'LL APPRECIATE HEARING FROM YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. DON'T YOU EVER TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. I WILL CALL HER. SO WHAT IS A PRESIDENT TO DO WHEN HE KNOWS HE CAN'T DO MUCH? PERHAPS ANNOUNCE GOALS SO VAGUE THERE'S NO WAY TO GAUGE IF HE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED THEM.
LET'S GET IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE THIS YEAR. IT'S TIME.
CITIZENSHIP MEANS STANDING UP UP FOR THE LIVES GUN VIOLENCE STEALS FROM US EACH DAY.
WE'LL COME TOGETHER TO GIVE EVERY WOMAN THE OPPORTUNITY SHE DESERVES BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED AMERICA SUCCEEDS.
Jon: WE ALREADY DO SO MUCH FOR WOMEN. SOME NIGHTS WE EVEN LET THEM DRINK FREE. I DON'T -- HOW ABOUT THE VETERANS? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR THEM THERE'S STILL 400,000 BACKLOGGED MEDICAL CLAIM FILES.
WE'LL KEEP SLASHING THAT BACKLOG. WE'LL CONTINUE TO JOIN FORCES TO HONOR AND SUPPORT THE MILITARY FAMILIES.
Jon: WE'LL BUILD THEM THEIR OWN MONUMENT, THE IMPOTENT BUREAUCRACY MONUMENT. NO ONE STEALS MORE SPOTLIGHT THAN OLD JOEY FOCUS PULLER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING EYES, CHECKING HIS MAIL, FLASHING THE GRILL. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? BANG, BANG! OH, THIS YEAR HE TEAMED UP WITH OLD JOHNNY BOEHNER TO FORM THE OLD MAN VERSION OF TRAGEDY AND COMEDY MASK. THEN IT WAS TIME FOR THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE THAT CAME IN NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT FOUR DELICIOUS FLAVORS COMING FROM STARTING WITH CONGRESSWOMAN CATHY MCMORRIS ROGERS APPARENTLY GIVING IT FROM A HOME FOR CIVIL WAR WIDOWS. FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN ILIANA ROSS LETNIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE'S A SENORA.
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Jon: I AGREE THE PRESIDENT DID TAKE THE AUTO BUS TO THE LIBRARY. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY I ONLY HAD EIGHT YEARS OF SPANISH. THEN IT WAS ON TO UTAH SENATOR MIKE LEE'S OFFICIAL TEA PARTY RESPONSE BECAUSE APPARENTLY ANYONE CAN GO ON THE (bleep) INTERNET AND BATTING CLEANUP SENATOR RAND PAUL WHO OFFERED A NONPARTISAN MESSAGE.
IT'S NOT THAT GOVERNMENT IS INHERENTLY STUPID THOUGH IT'S A DEBATABLE POINT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ALL I'M SAYING IS MAYBE WE SHOULD RETURN TO AN UNCIVILIZED STATE OF LAWLESS CHAOS. SO TO SUM UP THE 2014 STATE OF THE UNION A LITANY OF VAGUE PLEDGES. A JUSTIFIED VENTING THE FRUSTRATION WITH CONGRESS AND CAPPING IT THE WORLD'S (bleep) REPUBLICAN OPEN MIC NIGHT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
