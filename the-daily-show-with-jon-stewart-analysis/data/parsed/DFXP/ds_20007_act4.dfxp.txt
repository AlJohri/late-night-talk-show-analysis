Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY. BY THE WAY, BEFORE WE GO, I  WANT TO GIVE BIG UPS FOR JASON  JONES AND SAMANTHA, APPARENTLY MY PUKING THREW OFF THE SCHEDULE YESTERDAY. THEY CALLED SOME AUDIBLES AND THOSE TWO STEPPED UP, AND KNOCKED IT OUT  OF THE PARK. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. ANYWAY, HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT  OF ZEN.
TOM CORBETT IS PERFECT. THE RICK SNYDER. THE BRUCE RAUNER. THE BOB BEAUPREZ. THE ASA HUTCHINSON. THE RICK SCOTT IS PERFECT.
