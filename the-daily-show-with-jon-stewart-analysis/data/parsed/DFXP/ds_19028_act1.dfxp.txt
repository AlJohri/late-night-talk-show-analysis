FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." HEY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST THE LOVELY, THE TALENTED JENNIFER LAWRENCE WILL BE JOINING US. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT REAL QUICK OFF THE TOP I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAPPENED TO BE NEAR A TELEVISION SET TODAY -- [LAUGHTER] -- ALTHOUGH CLEARLY YOU ARE AT ONE RIGHT NOW. THAT WAS A STUPID OPENING, WASN'T IT? [LAUGHTER] BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE BIG NEWS OUT OF THE SENATE.
HARRY REID IS POISED TO THE LAUNCH THE NUCLEAR OPTION.
Jon: NOOOO! NO, HARRY DON'T -- THERE'S STILL GOOD IN THIS WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T KILL US ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS THE NUCLEAR OPTION, BY THE WAY?
THE NUCLEAR OPTION MEANS THAT IT WOULD ONLY TAKE 51 VOTES, A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO GET -- OVERCOME THIS FILIBUSTER THREAT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OOOOOOOH. [ LAUGHTER ] SO DECIDING TO ALLOW MAJORITY RULES TO INCREMENTALLY INCREASE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY IS SO EXTREME IT'S THE NUCLEAR OPTION. IT'S JUST LIKE HIROSHIMA OF VOTING. HOW WILL MITCH McCONNELL COUNTER?
MR. PRESIDENT, I MOVE TO ADJOURN THE SENATE UNTIL 5:00 P.M. AND ASK FOR THE YEAS AND NAYS.
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY IS IT JUST ME OR DOES IT FEEL LIKE QUITTIN TIME? A-YEAH, LET'S ALL HEAD HOME A LITTLE EARLY TONIGHT. A-YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY SENATOR McCONNELL TRIED TO MAKE A MORE SUBSTANTIVE CASE AGAINST THIS FILIBUSTER AMENDING.
I REALIZE THIS SORT OF WISHFUL THINKING MIGHT APPEAL TO THE UNINITIATED NEWCOMERS IN THE THEDEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE THATTHE SERVED EXACTLY ZERO DAYS IN THE MINORITY BUT THE REST OF THE GUYS IN THE CONFERENCE SHOULD KNOW BETTER. THOSE OF YOU IN THE CONFERENCE BEFORE SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
Jon: MARK MY WORDS ONE DAY YOU DEMOCRATS WILL WANT TO BE OBSTRUCTIONIST (bleep) MAKING A MOCKERY OF OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. AND WHO WILL BE LAUGHING THEN? TURTLEMAN. [LAUGHTER] BUT THAT ARGUMENT FAILED AND SOON THE SENATE DID THE UNTHINKABLE.
HISTORY MADE IN THE U.S. SENATE. JUST NOW THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR OPTION HAS PASSED.
Jon: AND LO THE NUCLEAR OPTION CAME TO PASS AND THERE WAS A BLIGHT UPON THIS LAND FOR ONCE JUDICIAL NOMINEES WOULD BE CONFIRMED BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY, CHRISTMAS WAS ABRUPTLY CANCELED AND BABIES WERE BORN KNOWING ALL THE CURSE WORDS. [ LAUGHTER ] GOO (bleep) THEY WOULD SAY. [LAUGHTER] WAH, WAH (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] AND YEAH -- THAT'S ALL I GOT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. LET'S TURN AWAY FROM WASHINGTON. LET'S TURN TOWARDS THE HOMEFRONT. NEXT THURSDAY IS A TIME TO GATHER WITH FAMILY, TO COMMEMORATE THE FEAST THAT NATIVE AMERICANS PREPARED FOR A STRUGGLING PILGRIM SETTLEMENT, THE DAY WE REFER TO AS THANKSGIVING, AND THE NATIVE AMERICANS REFER TO AS AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE. [LAUGHTER] BUT EAT QUICKLY YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH.
ALMOST ALL THE BIG STORES OPENING EARLIER THAN EVER. K-MART OPENS AT 6:00 A.M.
WAL-MART, JC PENNEY, BIG LOTS, KOHLS OPEN ON THANKSGIVING.
Jon: EVERY STORE VINEGAR WORLD OPEN. DILDO DEPOT OPEN, JUST GERBILS OPEN. (bleep) A BEAR WORKSHOP? OPEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IF YOU ARE THINKING I GUESS I HAVE TO SHOP ALL DAY BUT ONCE THE STORES CLOSE I CAN GO HOME AND GET A SOLID 15 MINUTES OF THANKSGIVING IN THINK AGAIN.
K-MART OPENING FOR 41 HOURS STRAIGHT.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS? IF SOMEONE TRAMPLES YOU FOR A FURBY THURSDAY MORNING THEY DON'T FIND YOUR BODY UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT. ALL RIGHT, MAYBE THANKSGIVING HAS BECOME A PREGAME FOR BLACK FRIDAY BUT AT LEAST THEY CANNOT TAKE AWAY OUR TURKEY.
BUTTERBALL WHICH PRODUCES 20% OF ALL U.S. TURKEYS SAYS THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF FRESH TURKEYS 16 POUNDS OR LARGER.
Jon: ARE YOU (bleep) KIDDING ME. IF MY TURKEY IS NOT AT LEAST 16 POUNDS WHY AM I HAVE -- I MIGHT AS WELL EAT A HUMMINGBYRD STUFFED WITH A SINGLE CROUTON AND A CRAZEIN.
THEY ARE LIMITING THE SUPPLIES OF FRESH TURKEYS.
THEY ARE NOT SAYING WHY THE BIRDS ARE ACTUALLY SMALLER THIS YEAR.
Jon: HELLO. PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO TO THE SOURCE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE TURKEYS. PLEASE WELCOME TURKEY NUMBER 307740 INSPECTED BY NUMBER FIVE. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. HEY, EVERYBODY. HOW YOU DOING, JON, NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JON NICE TO SEE YOU. WHAT IS GOING ON? TURKEY, LET ME -- [LAUGHTER] LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:  WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT IS THE WEIGHT LOSS?
