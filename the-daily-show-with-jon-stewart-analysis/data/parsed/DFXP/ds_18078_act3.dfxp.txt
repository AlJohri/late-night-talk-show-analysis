(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  BEST-SELLING AUTHOR. YOUR NEW BOOK IS ADVENTURES ON  THE ELEMENTARY CANAL. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, MARY ROACH. I LIKE YOUR BOOK. GREAT. VERY FUNNY.
THANK YOU, JOHN. Jon: THIS ONE IS CALLED... IT  ANSWERS ALL THE QUESTIONS OF  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE EAT. FOOD. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY...
YEAH  Jon: THE POST FOOD. THE WHOLE CHUTE  Jon: THE WHOLE CHUTE. WHY DOESN'T THE STOMACH DIGEST  ITSELF WHICH BRINGS UP AN  INTERESTING POINT THAT I WOULD LIKE LIKE TO ASK YOU. WHY DOESN'T THE STOMACH DIGEST  ITSELF
YOU CAN EAT STOMACH AND YOUR  OWN STOMACH WILL SAY I CAN TAKE  THAT APART BUT YET YOUR OWN  STOMACH. THE ANSWER IS... READY? IT DOES. TRICK. IT DOES. BUT IT'S ALSO YOUR... YOUR  STOMACH IS VERY GOOD AT  REBUILDING YOUR STOMACH LINING SO IT DOES BUT THEN IT BUILDS IT  BACK UP. I LOVE THIS, EVERY THREE DAYS  YOU HAVE A NEW STOMACH LINING.
Jon: REALLY? AND I DO TOO. Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. I HAVE A NEW STOMACH LINING. SO IT'S A CONSTANT PITCH BATTLE. EXHAUSTED PEOPLE REBUILDING  STOMACH
YOUR POOR STOMACH. IT NEVER STOPS WORKING ON YOUR  BEHALF
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. TALK TO ME ABOUT THE BEGINNING  OF THE PROCESS WHICH WOULD BE  THE SALIVA
ORAL PROCESSING  Jon: THANK YOU. TALK TO ME
ORAL PROCESSING. OKAY. THIS IS SOMETHING... I WENT TO  THE UNIVERSITY IN THE  NETHERLANDS WHERE THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GO INTO  THE FIELD OF ORAL PROCESSING.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO GO TO A  INSTITUTE.
YOU HAVE TO GO TO AN  INSTITUTE IN THE NETHERLANDS
Jon: IS THAT THEY CALL IT IN  THE NETHERLANDS?
SO WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IN  THERE IS BOLUS FORMATION. YOU'RE TAKING YOUR FOOD APART. GRINDING IT UP. TAKING IT APART. THEN YOU NEED TO REASSEMBLE IT  IN THE SWALLOWABLE STATE. WHICH IS A SILL INDEPENDENT  RICKAL BOLUS WHICH IS ONE OF MY  FAVORITE WORDS
Jon: I THINK ORAL PROCESSING  BOLUS IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE  WORDS. BUT SO YOU'RE BREAKING APART  YOUR FOOD TO ALLOW I GUESS THE  SAL I'VE A TO WORK ON IT. HOW DO YOU REFORM IT INTO A  CYLINDER. I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS  BEFORE BUT NOW THAT I AM,  THERE'S NO WAY I'M EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CYLINDER AGAIN  TO SWALLOW. I'M GOING TO BE MAKING LIKE  TRAPEZOIDS. HOW DOES THE BODY DO THAT?
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF  INTRAORAL BOLUS ROLLING THAT  GOES ON. THAT WAS EASY.
Jon: LATE AT NIGHT. THE TONGUE, THE WONDERFUL  TONGUE
Jon: IT DOES IT WITHOUT US  THINKING ABOUT IT
IF YOU TRY TO THINK ABOUT IT,  IF YOU TRY TO PAY ATTENTION,  IT'S VERY, VERY... I TRIED BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I WAS DOING  FOR TWO YEARS. I WAS LIKE TRYING TO PAY  ATTENTION TO MY BOLUS FORMATION. IT'S VERY HARD. YOU GET SORT OF CREEPED OUT.
Jon: IF YOU EAT SILL  INDEPENDENT RICKAL FOOD, DOES  YOUR MOUTH GO LIKE GOOD DAY FOR US, EASY DAY LIKE CHEETOS ARE  CYLINDERRAL
THE COMPETITOR EATERS IT'S  THE BOLUS SHAPED. STRAIGHT DOWN.
Jon: YES. THAT'S WHY HOT DOGS ARE SHAPED  THAT WAY. SO YOU'VE PUT... SO, SO,  SO...... I MEAN, THE BEAUTIFUL  PART ABOUT IT IS IT IS A BOLUS GOING DOWN AND IF THINGS ARE  GOING RIGHT THE BOLUS ON THE WAY  OUT
YOU ARE SO GOOD. Jon: THANK YOU. I READ. ARE THERE... BUT IN THE STOMACH  IT IS NON-BOLUS
IN THE STOMACH IT IS... Jon: MORE LIKE  A SLURRY. CHYME. THAT IS THE SLURRY.
Jon: THAT'S TWO MADE UP  WORDS. LIKE THE BOLUS. THE CHYME.
THAT IS, YEAH, BROKEN DOWN IN  KIND OF A SLURRY. IT CAN BE PASSED ON EASILY  THROUGH THE SPHINGTER THERE AT  THE BOTTOM OF THE STOMACH.
Jon: THE SPHINGTER IS DOING  THE BOLUS WORK TURNING IT...
BECAUSE THE INTESTINES ARE A  TUBE, THE CYLINDER IS A NATURAL  SHAPE FOR THE INTERIOR OF THE...
Jon: HOLD ON ONE SECOND. I JUST WANT TO TELL MY KIDS. GOOD NIGHT, GUYS. YOU STICK AROUND. IT IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. WONDERFUL AS EVERY MARY ROACH  BOOK IS. YOU SHOULD GET IT. MARY ROACH, EVERYBODY.
