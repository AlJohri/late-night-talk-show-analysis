(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. YOU MAY REMEMBER LAST WEEK THAT HARRY REID SAID MITT ROMNEY HADN'T PAID TAXES FOR TEN YEARS. IT USUALLY DOESN'T GAIN TRACTION AS NON-HIGH SCHOOLERS BUT IT'S  BEEN PICKED UP AS FACT BY SOME ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE.
SO THE WORD'S OUT THAT HE HASN'T PAID ANY TAXES FOR TEN YEARS. LET HIM PROVE HE HAS PAID TAXES BECAUSE HE HASN'T.
Jon: YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THE WORD IS OUT! AS THOUGH THAT'S EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE  THE ONE WHO PUT OUT THE WORD. (LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE YOU, A ONE MAN MORMON BLACKERNACLE CHOIR? CAN YOU TRADEMARK THAT FOR ME? THANK YOU. BLABBERNACLE. WE'LL MAKE T-SHIRTS AND HATS AND GO ON A TOUR. DO WE NEED TO SEE ROMNEY'S TAX RETURNS WHEN ALMOST EVERY DEAL HE'S EVER MADE ARE THE  PERSONIFICATION OF THE ISSUES AT HAND. LIKE THIS DEAL HE MADE.
DATING BACK TO HIS TIME AT BAIN CAPITAL. WHILE ROMNEY WAS C.E.O., BANE BOUGHT A TELEPHONE DIRECTORY COMPANY FROM ITALY'S GOVERNMENT  WHICH WAS RESOLD FOR 25 TIMES AS MUCH JUST TWO YEARS LATER.
ROMNEY HIMSELF PROBABLY MADE MORE THAN $50 MILLION AND AS MUCH AS $60 MILLION.
Jon: WOW, NO HARM THERE. SMART, ITALY MOVES TO PRIVATIZE PHONE DIRECTORIES. BAIN SEES AN OPPORTUNITY, STEPS IN, RIDES THE CREST OF THE INTERNET BUBBLE, SELLS IT BACK  FROM AN ITALIAN COMPANY AT THE PEAK OF ITS VALUE. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
THEY FUNNELED THEIR PROFIT US THERE SUBSIDIARIES IN LUXEMBOURG. THAT'S A COMMON PRACTICE BY FIRMS LOOKING TO REDUCE THEIR TAX LIABILITIES.
Jon: OH! SO THE CORPORATION THAT BENEFITS GREATLY FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF ITALY AND THE UNITED STATES  TAKES THAT PROFIT AND MAKES SURE ITALY AND THE UNITED STATES GET A AS LITTLE OF IT AS POSSIBLE BY  FUNNELING IT THROUGH LUXEMBOURG. A COUNTRY THAT EXISTS SOLELY AS THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL DIALYSIS MACHINE. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, TO ROMNEY, ALL THAT SLEIGHT OF HAND ISN'T A  LIABILITY, IT'S AN ASSET.
ROMNEY CAMPAIGN SPOKESWOMAN MICHELLE DAVIS GOES FURTHER "WITH THIS INVESTMENT, MITT  ROMNEY AND BAIN CAPITAL WITH ITS CONSORTIUM PARTNERS PARTNERED WITH A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM TO  TRANSFORM THIS COMPANY AND GROW IT INTO A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. MITT ROMNEY IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT THAT EXPERIENCE TO WORK."
Jon: SEE AMERICA? WE DON'T NEED FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN OUR POLICY MAKING MECHANICS OR THE REBUILDING OF  OUR STRUCTURE. WE JUST NEED BETTER ACCOUNTANTS. OH, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL WE FUNNEL SOUTH CAROLINA TO LUXEMBOURG. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, HOW DID THE ITALIANS FEEL ABOUT THIS DEAL?
ONE COMPANY SHAREHOLDER WHO OPPOSED THE DEAL SAID "THE GOVERNMENT GOT RIPPED OFF, IT  WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE DESTRUCTION OF ITALIAN INDUSTRY."
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE SEEN AS A "PERSONA NON GRATA" THERE.
Jon: WOW. MITT ROMNEY'S BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE TOO SHADY FOR ITALY. (LAUGHTER) ITALY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MITT ROMNEY HAS TO SAY TO ITALY  "I'M A LEGITIMATE BUSINESSMAN." (LAUGHTER) ITALY. A COUNTRY WHERE THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HEAD OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST MEDIA  CONGLOMERATE, AND THE HOST OF THEIR FINEST BUNGA BUNGA PARTIES IS THE SAME (BLEEP)ING GUY. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
