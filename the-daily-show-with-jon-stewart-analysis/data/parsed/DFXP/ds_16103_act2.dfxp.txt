(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WELL, WITH ALL THE DISASTROUS ECONOMIC NEWS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THE UPLIFTING  STORIES FROM THE WORLD OF FINANCE. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE. JOHN OLIVER FOUND IT AND FILED THIS REPORT.
Reporter: IN THIS ECONOMY, MANY PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR HOMES. AND FOR THIS COUPLE OF NAPLES, FLORIDA, RECEIVING A FORECLOSURE NOTICE FROM BANK OF AMERICA WAS THE LAST THING THEY EXPECTED. FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON.
WE HAD NO MORTGAGE. WE PAID FOR IT IN CASH. THE BANK DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO FORECLOSE ON US.
Reporter: YOU HAD NO MORTGAGE WITH THEM BUT THEY TRIED TO FORECLOSE ON YOU ANYWAY.
YES. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT WENT DOWN.
Reporter: THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
WE APPROACHED ABOUT 25 DIFFERENT LAWYERS AND NONE OF THEM WANTED THE CASE.
Reporter: NO ONE WOULD TAKE ON THIS DINOSAUR EXCEPT SUPER LAWYER TODD ALLEN.
I'VE BEEN A LAWYER FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
Reporter: WHAT?
YEAH, I'VE BEEN A LAWYER FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
Reporter: EIGHT MONTHS?
CORRECT.
Reporter: AT SOME POINT DID YOU NOT THINK, I'M TAKING ON THE BIGGEST BANK IN AMERICA. I MIGHT BE OUT OF MY MIND HERE.
ABSOLUTELY. BUT I WAS SO MAD AT THE WAY THE BANK OF AMERICA HAD TREATED THEM THAT I FELT LIKE I HAD TO ACT.
Reporter: SO THEY BRAVELY TOOK BANK OF AMERICA TO COURT.
THEY AWARDED US DAMAGES BUT THE BANK WOULDN'T PAY THEM.
Reporter: THEY WOULDN'T GIVE YOU THE MONEY THAT THE COURT ORDERED THAT THEY PAY YOU.
YOU GOT IT, JUST UNDER $3,000 FOR OUR TIME AND EFFORT.
Reporter: BUT WHAT COULD TWO AVERAGE AMERICANS AND A ROOKIE LAWYER DO AGAINST A  MASSIVE CORPORATION?
WE GOT THE SHERIFF AND A MOVING COMPANY AND WENT DOWN THERE TO START TAKING THEIR STUFF. YOU HEARD ME. WE FORECLOSED ON BANK OF AMERICA.
Reporter: HOLY (BEEP). YES, IT'S INCREDIBLE. THEY FORECLOSED ON THIS VERY BRANCH. I WANTED TO HEAR EVERY DETAIL.
I FOLLOWED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT INTO THE BANK. THEY WALKED IMMEDIATELY OVER TO THE MANAGER AND HANDED HIM THE WRIT OF EXECUTION.
Reporter: AWESOME.
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT BOLTED DOWN.
Reporter: JUST SO GREAT. THEY EVEN HAD ACTUAL REPO MEN. WHEN YOU FIRST REALIZED YOU WERE REPO-ING A BANK, HOW QUICKLY DID YOU THINK, HOLY  (BEEP), THIS IS AWE IS MANY.
TWO SECONDS.
Reporter: WHAT WAS THE BANK MANAGER'S FACE LIKE WHEN HE REALIZED WHAT YOU WERE DOING? >>.
HE WAS VISIBLY SHAKEN.
Reporter: WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?
YOU'VE BEEN FORECLOSED.
Reporter: I FEEL BAD FOR HIM BUT (BEEP). IS THIS THE ACTUAL BANK?
THAT'S IT.
Reporter: WOW. THAT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST STORY I'VE EVER HEARD.
THANK YOU.
Reporter: NO, THANK YOU. IT'S RARE TO HAVE SUCH A MOMENT OF PURE CATHARSIS. â™ª THEY SHUT THIS (BEEP) BANK. I HAD TO TELL THE WORLD. GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE. GATHER ROUND. I AM HEAR TO TELL YOU A WONDERFUL TALE. THERE WAS A BRANCH OF BANK OF AMERICA IN FLORIDA WHO TRIED TO FORECLOSE ON A COUPLE WHO  DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A MORTGAGE WITH THAT BANK. SO THE NICE COUPLE TOOK THE EVIL BANK MANAGER TO COURT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WON!
WOW.
Reporter: THE JUDGE ORDERED THE BANK TO PAY THE COUPLE'S LEGAL FEES. (SPEAKING SPANISH).
Reporter: BUT THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY OF THAT MONEY. THIS COUPLE SHOWED UP TO THE BANK WITH A REPO TRUCK, A LAWYER AND A (BEEP) SHERIFF  AND FORECLOSED ON THEM. THEY FORECLOSED ON A (BEEP) BANK. I KNOW. IT'S THE GREATEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED. THIS STORY WAS SO GREAT, IT WAS ADDICTIVE. TELL IT TO ME AGAIN. AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN.
WE JUST WANT TO GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.
Reporter: YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
IT'S BEEN NICE BUT WE WANT TO GET BACK TO OUR NORMAL ROUTINE.
Reporter: JESUS DIDN'T SAY, WELL, THAT WAS A GREAT STORY. NOW I'M JUST GOING TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE. IT'S NOT UP TO YOU ANYMORE. THIS STORY IS GETTING OUT THERE. IF THEY WEREN'T GOING TO COOPERATE, I KNEW WHO WOULD. YOU KNOW THIS IS A MOVIE, RIGHT? THIS IS A MOVIE.
I'D LIKE TO THINK SO.
IN A WORLD WHERE BANKS HOLD THE MONEY AND REGULAR PEOPLE ARE HELPLESS, ONE SCRAPPY  LAWYER IS FIGHTING BACK.
THAT'S IT. THIS BANK HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN.
JOHN OLIVER IS TODD ALLEN.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, TODD ALLEN.
MARIA SHRIVER IS THE BANK MANAGER.
YOU'VE BEEN FORECLOSED.
THANK YOU, FLORIDA STATE LAWYER TODD ALLEN.
YOU'RE WELCOME. VICTORIA'S SECRET MODEL.
THIS FALL....
I HATE AMERICA.
...DEPOSIT THIS. HEADS WILL ROLL. THE FORECLOSER.
AIM A TOTAL (BEEP).
YES.
Jon: JOHN OLIVER.
