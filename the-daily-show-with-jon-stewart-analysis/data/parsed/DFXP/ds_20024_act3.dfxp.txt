John: WELCOME BACK. OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE STAR OF "ROSEWATER." PLEASE WELCOME GAEL GARCIA BERNAL! COME ON. COME ON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GAEL GARCIA BERNAL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
John: MY FIRST QUESTION IS ACTUALLY MAZIAR, FOR YOU. WHEN YOU HEARD --
WHICH MAZIAR? WHICH MAZIAR?
John: THE REAL ONE. THAT'S RIGHT.
OH OKAY.
John: THE ONE THAT IS SLIGHTLY LESS COMPELLING TO LOOK AT.
WELL THANK YOU.
John: WITH THAT IN MIND, WITH THAT IN MIND, WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD--
YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.
John: WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD THAT GAEL WAS GOING TO PLAY YOU IN A MOVIE, AND YOU LOOKED AT A PHOTO OF HIM DID YOU THINK ( BLEEP ) YEAH? THAT IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S EXACLY, THAT'S EXACTLY TRUE. I MEAN, GAEL HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS SINCE HE WAS IN "Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN" AND "AMORES PERROS" GREAT FILMS THAT I'M SURE EVERYONE HAS SEEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THE GOOD THING ABOUT GAEL IS THAT HE IS NOT A STEREOTYPEICAL HOLLYWOOD ACTOR WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHERE IRAN IS ON THE MAP. HE IS VERY POLITICALLY AWARE. HE DOES HIS DOCUMENTARIES. HE HAS A DOCUMENTARY FESTIVAL. SO WHEN WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS STORY, HE KNEW THE BACKDROP. I JUST HAD TO GIVE HIM THE DETAILS.
John: SO, ON YOUR END GAEL, YOU'RE IN A TRICKY SPOT, BECAUSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN STRANGE TO BE DOING THOSE PRISON SCENES WHEN THE MAN WHO WAS TORTURED WHO YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE IS IN THE NEXT ROOM MAYBE GOING, "IT HURT MORE THAN THAT." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR YOU TO HAVE ON IN YOUR HEAD.
IT IS, IT IS. AND, ALSO, THERE WAS ANOTHER ADDED PRESSURE, THAT WE WERE SHOOTING IN A REAL PRISON SOMETIMES WITH PEOPLE IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT RIGHT THERE, AND RIGHT BESIDE THE CELL THAT WE WERE, THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE FOR, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WEEKS, FOR RAPE AND WE WERE DOING THIS ACT, AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, YES. THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH FILM. SOMETIMES YOU FALL INTO THIS KIND OF POINT WHERE YOU THINK THIS REENACTMENT, THIS REINTERPRETATION, IS IT THIS WORTH IT? ARE WE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO CONNECT, THAT'S GOING TO TRANSCEND? FORTUNATELY WITH THIS AND JON'S GUIDANCE, AND THANKS TO MAZIAR'S COMPELLING STORY AND HIS INTERPRETATION OF WHAT HE WENT THROUGH, WE ALL THE TIME KEPT THE BOATS FLOATING AND FELT THAT THIS WAS WORTH KEEPING GOING.
HOW DOES IT FEEL ON YOUR END? BECAUSE HE'S SPECTACULAR IN THIS, AND HOW IS IT FOR YOU WATCHING THOSE PRISON SCENES? WHERE DOES IT FALL ON THE SCALE OF THERAPEUTIC TO TRAUMATIC?
WELL IT'S THE CONTINUATION OF SOMETHING THAT WAS STARTED IN PRISON. AS I MENTIONED, I PROMISED MYSELF THAT WHEN I COME OUT OF PRISON, I WILL WRITE A BOOK, AND I WOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN PRISON. SO WORKING ON THE SCRIPT WITH JON, BEING ON THE THE SCENE, TALKING ABOUT THE FILM RIGHT NOW, IT IS ALL PART OF THE SAME PROCESS THAT I WANT TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE PLIGHT OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING-- NOT ONLY IN IRAN, BUT ALSO IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
John: IN MEXICO. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF TROUBLES FOR JOURNALISTS.
YES.
WATCHING GAEL REENACTING WHAT I WENT THROUGH, IT WAS JUST ANOTHER JOURNALISTIC MISSION FOR ME THAT I WAS LOOKING AT IT FROM A DISTANCE. > John: I GUESS JUST DON'T WANT CLOSURE ON IT. YOU WANT TO KEEP THE WOUND OPEN?
NO, I DON'T WANT TO KEEP THE WOUND OPEN BUT IT'S PART OF THE HEALING PROCESS. IF I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT, THE WOUNDS REMAIN OPEN. BUT WHEN I AM TALKING ABOUT IT, IT IS HEALING.
YOU WERE PICKING UP ON THE PLIGHT OF JOURNALISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD --
John: RIGHT.
ESPECIALLY WHERE I COME FROM, THERE WAS AN INNATE SORT OF CONNECTION THERE.
John: SURE.
AS WELL WITH THIS ISSUE, AND AMONGST MANY OTHER ISSUES, VERY, I MENA, THE CRISIS OF POWER THAT'S LIVING IN THE WORLD AS WELL. I MEAN IT'S THE LIMITATIONS, WHERE IT CAN REACH, WHERE IT SHOULDN'T REACH, THE FACT THAT MAZIAR CAME OUT, REALIZING THAT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS TORTURE AND IT IS AN ACCEPTED-- AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE ALL OVER THE WORLD.
John: RIGHT. RIGHT.
AND ANOTHER ADDED ELEMENT THAT UNITED US IS THE FACT THAT IRAN AND MEXICO IS A SUSTAINED INDUSTRY OF HAIR GEL AROUND THE WORLD. YEAH WE ARE --
John: WHAT? YOU CAN'T THROW THAT IN RIGHT AT THE END. I FEEL LIKE, WHAT, THEY SUSTAIN THE HAIR GEL INDUSTRY?
YES, THE HAIR GEL, HAIR GEL WOULD BE EXTINCT IF IT WERE NOT FOR IRAN AND MEXICO. YEAH.
BASICALLY HAIR GEL IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF ALL DIFFERENT CULTURES. WE CAN BRING PEACE TO THE WORLD THROUGH HAIR GEL.
John: AND ON THAT NOTE --
EVEN THE DALAI LAMA.
John: FANTASTIC JOB WITH THE MOVIE. "ROSEWATER" WILL BE IN THEATERS TOMORROW. MAZIAR BAHARI AND GAEL GARCIA BERNAL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
