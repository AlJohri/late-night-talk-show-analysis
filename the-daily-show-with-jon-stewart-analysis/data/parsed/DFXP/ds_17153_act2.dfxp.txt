THE GENERAL ELECTION SEASON IS  ONCE AGAIN UPON US IN ALL ITS  TERRIBLE GLORY, BUT WILL THIS  TIME BE DIFFERENT? WILL WE FIND A WAY TO ENGAGE IN  A SUBSTANTIVE, YET RESPECTFUL  CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF  OUR REPUBLIC, OR NOT? [LAUGHTER] REPORTING FROM THE RECENT  CONVENTIONS, "THE DAILY SHOW,"  BEST [BLEEPED] NEWS TEAM ON  TELEVISION, OFFERS THIS CLUE.
WITH THE CONVENTIONS OVER,  THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE HAS  OFFICIALLY BEGUN, WHICH MEANS  FOR NEXT SEVEN WEEKS BRACE YOURSELVES FOR A WHOLE LOT OF  THIS.
WHEN THE TIDE OF NATIONAL  DEBT RISES...
SHE PASSED AWAY IN 22 DAYS.
IF HE WIN, WE LOSE.
BUT WHEN WE TALKED TO DELL  COMBATS IN TAMPA AND CHARLOTTE,  WE SAW A REAL DESIRE TO RISE  ABOVE ALL THE VITRIOL.
WE NEED TO PUT THE SUCCESS OF  OUR COUNTRY BEFORE POLITICS,  BEFORE MONEY AND BEFORE PARTY.
WE DO NEED TO STOP THE  POLITICAL BICKERING.
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE OUR  SIMILARITIES AND FOCUS ON THE  SIMILARITIES RATHER THAN OUR  DIFFERENCES.
EXACTLY. AND THEY ALREADY AGREE ON ONE  IMPORTANT THING.
THIS IS THE MOST NEGATIVE  CAMPAIGN I'VE EVER SEEN. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 25  YEARS.
IT'S DOWNRIGHT NASTY.
THERE'S A LOT OF BLAME GOING  AROUND.
WHO IS TO BLAME?
THE REPUBLICANS.
I THINK IT'S THE DEMOCRATS'  FAULT.
THE REPUBLICANS' FAULT.
DO YOU THINK THERE IS TOO  MUCH FINGER-POINTING GOING ON?
MOST DEFINITELY.
WITH WOULD YOU BLAME?
THE DEMOCRATS.
YOU TURN TV ON, AND IT'S  NOTHING BUT NEGATIVE.
WHO IS TO BLAME FOR ALL THAT  NEGATIVITY. HERE IT COMES.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND FOX  NEWS.
THERE IT IS.
THERE'S A REAL THIRST ON BOTH  SIDES TO ELEVATE THE TONE OF THE  CAMPAIGN AND RESPECT THOSE WHO HOLD A DIFFERENT VIEW.
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF TERRORIST,  A BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ALL THE  NAME-CALLING GOING ON?
REALLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  ARE TURNED OFF BY IT.
DON'T LIKE RUSH LIMBAUGH, FOX  NEWS, ANYTHING.
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE  RACHEL MAD COW ON MSLGBTV.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE WHINERS.
WE THEY LOST THE HOUSE, WE  TOOK THEIR BINKY.
THEY'RE BEHAVING LIKE  TODDLERS. THEY WANT ONLY THE TOYS IN THEIR  SAND BOX FOR THEM.
WHY IS EVERYBODY... [BABBLING], IN FACT, IT'S LIKE  THAT.
CLEARLY THE NEGATIVITY HAS TO  STOP, AND IT HAS TO STOP NOW.
REPUBLICANS, STOP THE  FINGER-POINTING. TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES. LET'S STOP THE NEGATIVE  CAMPAIGNING.
STOP THAT FINGER-POINTING.
STOP IT.
STOP IT!
SERIOUSLY, STOP THE [BLEEPED] FINGER POINTING.
STOP THAT DAMN  FINGER-POINTING. I MEAN IT.
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? STOP IT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU,  ROMNEY AND RYAN?
HOW ARE YOU NOT SEEING THIS?
HOW ARE YOU NOT SEEING HOW  BAD IT IS FOR ALL OF US IN  AMERICA.
LET'S NOT COPY US. DO IT RIGHT.
ARE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS  EQUIVALENT? OF COURSE NOT, BUT UNTIL  NOVEMBER, ARE THEY BOTH LIKELY  TO BE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING,
