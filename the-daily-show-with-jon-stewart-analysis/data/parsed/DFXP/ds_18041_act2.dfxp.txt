Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW. DETROIT MICHIGAN. THE CITY THAT IS DOING PERFECTLY  FINE AND NEEDS ABSOLUTELY NO  FREE OUTSIDE HELP REGARDING THE  INFRASTRUCTURE. AL WILL EXPLAIN.
GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS OUT OF  CONTROL. TAKE THE HARD HIT CITY OF  DETROIT. THEY ARE TRYING TRYING TO BUILD A  BILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE TO CANADA  EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE AMBASSADOR BRIDGE. FORTUNATELY DETROITERS OF ALL  WALKS ARE TAKING A STAND. SOCCER MOMS.
DETROIT DOES NOT NEED ANOTHER  BRIDGE.
TEA PARTYERS.
IT'S NOT JUST DETROIT IT'S  MICHIGAN TASMS.
EVEN THE BLACK PANTHERS. WE DON'T NEED A NEW BRIDGE. WE NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON  FEEDING THE NEEDY. NO SECOND BRIDGE PERIOD. WE DON'T NEED IT, WE DON'T WANT  IT.
MO BRIDGES, MO PROBLEMS, AM I  RIGHT? NO. CANADA IS ACTING LIKE IT MAKES  FISCAL SENSE FOR THE U.S.
THE OLD BRIDGE WON'T LAST  FOREVER. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S  GOING TO LAST. TWO MILLION U.S. JOBS ALONE  DEPEND ON THE TRADE THAT THAT  BRIDGE CARRIES.
BUT YOU REALIZE THIS IS NOT  THE TIME FOR AMERICAN TAXPAYERS  TO BE FORCED TO PAY FOR A NEW  BRIDGE.
THEY ARE NOT FORCED TO PAY  FOR A NEW BRIDGE. CANADA IS PAGE FOR THE BRIDGE.
THAT'S RIGHT. PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN ARE GOING TO  HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ENTIRE --  WAIT, WHAT DID HE SAY?
MICHIGAN WILL PAY NOTHING FOR  THIS BRIDGE.
DEFINE NOTHING.
ZERO DOLLARS, ZERO RISK, ZERO  LIABILITY.
DEFINE ZERO.
NO COST TO MICHIGAN AT ALL. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
DEFINE NOTHING AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOTHING PROBABLY MEANS  SOMETHING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU  CONSIDER HOW MANY TIMES AMERICA HAS BEEN BURNED BY SLICK TALKING  CANADIANS.
LOOK, WHEN POLITICIANS TELL  YOU THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO  COST YOU NOTHING, GRAB YOUR WALLET, GRAB YOUR MONEY AND RUN. BREAK WIDE, DUDE.
THE CANADIANS ARE SAYING THEY  ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS  BRIDGE. I DON'T TRUST THEM.
THEY SAY A LOT OF THINGS  SOMETIMES IN FRENCH.
AND THEY BUY MILK AT SAM'S  BECAUSE CANADIAN MILK IS VERY  EXPENSIVE. TRUE STORY.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO  WITH THIS?
NOTHING.
CANADA IS OFFERING A TROJAN  HORSE. DO YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO  HIDE A BUNCH OF CANADIANS IN  THERE AND ATTACK US ONCE IT'S  COMPLETE. NO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE  CANADIANS IT'S CHINAMEN.
I JUST WANT AMERICANS ON THAT  BRIFNLG I DON'T WANT A TROJAN  HORSE DELIVERING CHINA STEEL AND  CHINAMEN.
JUST FYI I DON'T THINK  ANYBODY IS USING CHINAMEN  ANYMORE. THE ONLY PEOPLE ELIGIBLE ARE  U.S. AND CANADIAN WORKERS. THE UNITED STATES STEELWORKS  SUPPORT THIS PROJECT. DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD SUPPORT  A PROJECT THAT USES CHINESE  STEEL.
WHY ARE THEY PUSHING A  PROPOSAL THAT ALLOWS MICHIGAN TO  VETO THE SECOND BRIDGE. IN FACT, THIS SWEET OLD DETROIT  BUSINESSMAN IS PAYING FOR  COMMERCIALS WARNING PEOPLE.
THERE'S ALWAYS HIDDEN COSTS.
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO PAY FOR  THAT BRIDGES AND IT'S GOING TO  BE OUR CHILDREN.
COME TO THINK OF IT, WHY DOES  HE CARE SO MUCH?
THE 258th RICHEST MAN IN  THE UNITED STATES IS THE OWNER  OF AMBASSADOR BRIDGE AND HAS BEEN SINCE, I THINK 1977.
YOU ARE TELL MEG THAT ONE MAN  OWNS THE AMBASSADOR BRIDGE.
YES.
YOU THINK I'M STUPID?
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE STUPID  AT ALL. IT'S A FACT.
YOU THINK I'M SORT OF AN  (bleep), DON'T YOU?
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT  CLEARER ONE MAN OPENS THE MOST  IMPORTANT BORDER CROSSING IN NORTH AMERICA. WHO LET THAT HAPPEN? THE VOTERS OF DETROIT. THEY ALLOWED A PRIVATE COMPANY  TO BUILD AND OWN THE BRIDGE  WHICH MAROON BROUGHT 50 YEARS  LATER. WAIT UNTIL MY BLACK PANTHER  FRIEND FINDS OUT AN OLD WHITE  DUDE OWNS THE ONLY BRIDGE TO CAND YANCH MATTIE MAROON, YES.
THE LEADER OF BLACK PANTHERS  IS PROTECTING AN 85-YEAR-OLD  WHITE BILLIONAIRE.
IN THIS TOWN I KICK THE ASS  NOT KISS IT.
WHY IS WHY I HAVE A DIFFICULT  TIME TRYING TO TELL YOU HOW TO  RUN YOUR BLACK PANTHER BUSINESS BUT I THINK YOU ARE WORKING FOR  THE MAN. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT AN  85-YEAR-OLD MILLIONAIRE NAMED  MATTIE MAROON SOMEHOW OWNS THE ONLY BRIDGE THAT CONNECTS CANADA  TO DETROIT, MICHIGAN AND NOW  WHEN A RIVAL BRIDGE PROPOSAL COMES ALONG, HE TAKES OUT AN AD  CAMPAIGN TO SLAM THE SECOND  BRIDGE AND PEOPLE ARE DOUBTING THE CANADIANS?
YES.
HIS A QUESTION:  WHAT DID  MATTIE MAROON THINK? AFTER ALL THIS IS DETROIT HIS  CITY. A TOWN THAT TRUSTED HIM ABOUT  THE -- WITH THE BRIDGE MONOPOLY,  HIS OFFICE WOULDN'T RETURN OUR  CALLS. I AM HERE TO TALK TO MR. MAROON  WHO OWNS THE BRIDGE.
$4.75, SIR.
HE OWNS THE BRIDGE. IT'S SORT OF A MONOPOLY. I'LL BE BACK. HI, IT'S ME AGAIN. I WANT TO TALK TO MATTY MAROON. THAT'S FINE. DENISE, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ODD  THAT ONE MAN OWNS THE BRIDGE?
YOU NEED TO STOP (bleep)  AROUND.
OH, WELL, WHEN PUSH CAME TO  SHOVE 59% OF THE COMMUNITY  DECIDED NOT TO BE COMPLETELY STUPID AND SHOT DOWN PROP 6  WHICH DOES MEAN 1.8 MILLION  DETROITERS STILL DIDN'T WANT A FREE FRIGGIN BRIDGE. I HAD ONE MORE QUESTION WHERE  (bleep) AM I?
IN DETROIT, BABY.
EXACTLY IT WAS GETTING DARK. TIME TO GET THE (bleep) OUT OF  HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
