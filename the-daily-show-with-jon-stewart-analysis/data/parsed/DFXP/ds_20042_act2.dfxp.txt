( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  AS WE HAVE HEARD, THE 114th CONGRESS IS NOW OFFICIALLY IN SESSION. 100 SENATORS, 435 CONGRESS PEOPLE SET TO DO THE NATION'S BUSINESS.
LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO TAX EVASION, CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMM SAYS HE'S RESIGNING.
HE DECIDED TO RESIGN BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELIEVE HE CAN CONTINUE TO BE 100% EFFECTIVE.
Jon:  BECAUSE HE WILL BE IN JAIL. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW -- IT'S SAD THAT BEING IN JAIL AND HE STILL HAS TO THINK LIKE, I COULD STILL DO THIS, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) I COULD BE, LIKE, 92%, 93% CONGRESS PERSON FROM JAIL. I MEAN, HOW HARD IS IT? YOU MAY REMEMBER STATEN ISLAND'S MICHAEL GRIMM AS THE GENTLEMAN WHO THREATENED TO THROW ANOTHER GENTLEMAN OFF THE BALCONY AND BREAK HIM LIKE A BOY WHEN HE HAD THE GALL TO ASK GRIMM A QUESTION BECAUSE HE'S A REPORTER. IT WAS DURING A TELEVISION INTERVIEW. OH I'M GOING TO MISS YOU SWEET BOY-BREAKING PRINCE.
GRIMM COPPED TO A SINGLE COUNT OF HIDING NEARLY $1 MILLION IN REVENUE FROM A MANHATTAN RESTAURANT HE OWNED.
Jon:  A MILLION DOLLARS? WOW! THAT'S NOT NOTHING. HOW DID HE PULL THAT OFF?
I HAD, FOR EXAMPLE, DELIVERY BOYS THAT WERE PAID OFF THE BOOKS, AND AS A RESULT THE TAXES WERE NOT ACCURATE. EVERYONE PAYS PEOPLE OFF THE BOOKS AND IT'S VERY COMMON BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR -- IT'S WRONG. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WHAT KIND OF APOLOGY IS THAT? "BUT EVERYBODY DOES IT. LOOK, DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T DO IT. YOU DO IT. YOU PAY PEOPLE OFF THE BOOKS. WHO DOESN'T COMMIT A LITTLE TAX FRAUD. YOU KNOW! BUT I'M TAKING THE FALL FOR IT, YOU SONS OF ( BLEEP )." BY THE WAY, EXCONGRESSMAN, YOUR HEALTHALICIOUS ESTABLISHMENT DEFRAUDED THE GOVERNMENT OF TAXES ON NEARLY $1 MILLION OF UNREPORTED REVENUE WAGES. SO DON'T ACT LIKE THAT'S EXPLAINED BY A COUPLE OF OFF THE BOOKS DELIVERY BOYS. I MEAN, JESUS, LET'S SAY YOU PAID EACH DELIVERY BOY AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE, WHICH I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T. AND LET'S SAY THAT THESE WORKERS PUT IN AT LEAST 40 HOURS A WEEK FOR FOUR YEARS. AND THAT GRIMM OWED THE FEDS, STATE, AND CITY ABOUT, OH, I DON'T KNOW, 16% ON THOSE SALARIES. THAT'S ROUGHLY 7 BUCKS AN HOUR TIMES 40 HOURS, TIMES 52 WEEKS TIMES FOUR YEARS, TIMES 16%. DIVIDE A MILLION DOLLARS BY THAT NUMBER, AND MICHAEL GRIMM'S HEALTHALICIOUS RESTAURANT WAS APPARENTLY EMPLOYING 107 FULL-TIME DELIVERY BOYS. WHERE DID THEY KEEP THE BICYCLES? AND WHILE THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A FACELESS FINANCIAL CRIME, ITS VICTIMS ARE ALL TOO FACEFUL.
ON THIS FIRST DAY BACK-TO-WORK ON THE CAPITOL, STATEN ISLAND RESIDENTS WILL HAVE NO REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS.
FOR MORE WE TURN TO JASON JONES IN FORMER CONGRESSMAN GRIMM'S DISTRICT IN STATEN ISLAND. JASON, WELCOME. I KNOW IT'S COLD OUT TONIGHT. VERY, VERY COLD OUT TONIGHT.
IT IS.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S COLD. I CAN SEE YOU OUT THERE IN A PARKA.
IT'S FREEZING.
Jon:  WEARING A HAT. YOU LOOK COLD. IT'S VERY COLD HERE TONIGHT. JASON -- AND YOU'RE BLOWING INTO YOUR HANDS WHICH IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon:  JASON, HOW IS STATEN ISLAND HOLDING UP TONIGHT? OH BOY.
JON, IT IS A DISASTER. ONE DAY WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION, AND STATEN ISLAND HAS BECOME A WASTELAND OF -- A WASTELAND OF NAIL SALONS AND TASTELESS LAWN ORNAMENTS.
Jon:  ACTUALLY, JASON, I THINK THAT THAT'S --
CONDITIONS HERE HAVE DETERIORATED SO FAST, THE MEN HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SELL THE SLEEVES OFF THEIR SHIRTS. SURVIVING SOLELY ON GARLIC KNOTS AND MUSCLE MILKS.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S JUST, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS, I THINK THAT'S STATEN ISLAND--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF NUCLEAR EXPLOSION HERE, OKAY? AS WE DETERMINED, IT'S THE DEAD OF WINTER, BUT EVERYONE HERE IS SUPER TANNED.
Jon:  IT'S REALLY JUST-- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IT'S JUST STATEN ISLAND, JASON. THAT'S--
SO IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS?
Jon:  YEAH.
WELL, THEN IT'S FINE. THEN. IT'S -- NO NEWS TO REPORT.
Jon: SO THERE'S NO -- BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE A SPECIAL ELECTION? WHO WILL STATEN ISLAND PICK TO REPLACE MICHAEL GRIMM?
WELL, LOTS OF CANDIDATES LINING UP, JON. YOU'VE GOT JOEY BAGGA-DONUTS. YOU HAVE YOUR JOEY FROM AROUND THE (BLEEP) BLOCK. YOU GOT JOEY FROM AROUND THE CORNER AND JOEY FROM RIGHT DOWN THE (BLEEP) STAIRS. ALSO, WE HAVE ALSO A USED WASHER-DRYER.   ( APPLAUSE ) THAT WOULD BE MY VOTE.
Jon: THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS TOPIC, VERY SERIOUS TOPIC AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A COMPETITIVE RACE.
IT IS. BUT, OF COURSE, THE FRONT-RUNNER IS STATEN ISLAND DISTRICT ATTORNEY DAN DONOVAN.
Jon: ARE YOU -- THE PROSECUTOR WHO COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T GET A GRAND JURY TO INDICT THE COP THAT CHOKED OUT ERIC GARNER?
YEAH.
Jon: I-- OH, I GET IT. IT'S LIKE A JOKE, THE WASHER-DRYER THING. VERY DROLL, JASON. VERY DROLL.
YEAH, IT'S NO JOKE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ELECT DAN DONOVAN. AND GUESS WHAT? THIS NEW ELECTION IS GOING TO COST $1 MILLION, OR ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU CAN LAUNDER THROUGH YOUR AVERAGE HEALTHALICIOUS FRANCHISE.
Jon:  THANK YOU, JASON. JASON JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
