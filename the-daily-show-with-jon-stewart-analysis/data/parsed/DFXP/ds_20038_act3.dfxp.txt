THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO -- UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR TODAY. NOW, I'M GOING TO GO WITH THUNDEROUS. THAT WAS THUNDER OVATION.
THAT WAS THUNDEROUS. THAT WAS STUNNING, THANK YOU.
Jon: THAT WAS STUNNING. NOW THEY'RE DOING IT AGAIN. THEY JUST KEEP DOING IT.
I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT HERE.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY MUSICIANS HAVE THE HEARING PROBLEMS. BECAUSE THE THUNDEROUS OVATIONS.
THIS IS RIGHT, YEAH. Jon: WHO ELSE GETS THAT IN THE -- YOU KNOW, I GET THAT, SO YOU WALK OUT AND PEOPLE APPLAUD.
YEAH.
Jon: DO YOU REMEMBER, SO I'VE HAD A LOT OF JOBS WHERE I SHOW UP, NO APPLAUSE.
BARTENDER.
Jon: SURE, I WAITED TABLES. NO APPLAUSE. NEVER OH, HE'S COMING WITH THE MENUS.
NOTHING.
Jon: NOTHING.
WELL, THAT'S WHY I WENT INTO MUSIC, JON.
Jon: I THINK IT WAS, YOU KNOW, A WISE CHOICE. I HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR YOU. I THINK A FALL BACK PLAN IS ALWAYS --
THAT'S WHAT MY DAD SAID TO ME.
Jon: DID HE REALLY?
OH YEAH.
Jon: NOW HOW LONG -- HOW MUCH SUCCESS DID YOU HAVE BEFORE FAMILY, FRIENDS THOUGHT, WE'RE GOING TO GET OFF HIS BACK NOW, WE'RE GOING TO LET HIM GO. LIKE WHERE WERE YOU, WAS IT, WAS IT CHARTING? WAS IT ED SULLIVAN? WHAT WAS THE MOMENT WHERE EVERYONE WENT OKAY YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT FOR A LIVING. THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FINE.
YEAH, YEAH I THINK IT WAS JUST THE FIRST RECORD ON THE CHARTS PROBABLY. YEAH.
Jon: OR WAS IT THE SONG FOR "DESTINY" FOR THE VIDEO GAME. WAS THAT, WAS THAT WHERE THEY SAID, OKAY NOW HE HAS MADE IT?
WELL, THIS ONLY JUST HAPPENED, YEAH. THEY NEVER BELIEVED IT. BUT YEAH, THE SONG FOR "DESTINY" I'M NOT HERE TO PLUG.
Jon: NO.
NO.
Jon: NO I'M NOT HERE TO PLUG IT EITHER.
THIS IS JUST A CASUAL MENTION.
Jon: WE WOULD PROBABLY TALK ANYWAY.
ABOUT THAT. RIGHT.
Jon: OR JUST HANGING OUT AS WE OFTEN DO.
WE OFTEN DO. YEAH.
Jon: ME OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE. YOU IN IT.
WELL -- YOU KNOW.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WELL, BUT YOU KNOW.
Jon: HOW DO THEY GET YOU TO DO THAT? YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I THINK TO MYSELF, JEEZ I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PAUL MCCARTNEY DO A SONG FOR THIS, BUT YOU WOULDN'T.
I MIGHT. IT DEPENDS HOW YOU ASKED ME.
Jon: REALLY? IT'S A INTERESTING THING. I GUESS PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THESE ARE NOW BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES. THESE ARE FRANCHISES. THESE ARE BIGGER THAN MAJOR MOTION PICTURES.
THAT'S RIGHT. AND THAT IS WHAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME BY THE PEOPLE WHO ASKED ME. WHY DON'T YOU DO THIS, PAUL. IT'S BIGGER THAN ANYTHING. NO, THE THING WAS I'D SEEN MY GRANDKIDS MAINLY PLAYING THEM. AND I KIND OF WOULD SAY GIVE ME A GO AT THAT. COME ON. I WOULD GET KILLED WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE OF SECONDS, HAND IT BACK TO THEM, GO ON. OKAY SO, YOU KNOW I WAS MR. COOL. COME ON, GIVE IT UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW CRAZY IS THAT. PAUL MCCARTNEY. CAUSE IT IS, I FIND MYSELF DOING THAT AS WELL. THAT WHATEVER MY KIDS ARE INTERESTED IN I TRY TO DO A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR. BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS.
THEY DON'T CARE, NO.
Jon: DO YOU KNOW WHAT MY SON SAID TO ME THE OTHER NIGHT?
WHAT?
Jon: WHY CAN'T YOU DO A SHOW LIKE "ELLEN"?
HE COULD HAVE SOMETHING THERE, JON.
Jon: HE SAID DO A SHOW LIKE "ELLEN." HE SAID I WATCH YOUR SHOW. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND IT. I WATCH HER SHOW AND I REALLY ENJOY IT. [LAUGHING]
AND DOES SHE GIVES OUT CDs AND THINGS, AND HOLIDAYS.
Jon: YOU ARE WISHING YOU WERE ON "ELLEN" TOO. NO, YOU ARE! I SEE IT.
NO, I'M NOT. I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE. [LAUGHING] I REALLY AM. Jon: THIS IS SO NOT RIGHT. IF YOU DO THIS FOR THEM IS THERE LIKE A CHEAT CODE FOR THE GUY WHO WROTE THE SONG FOR THE VIDEO GAME WHERE YOU ARE LIKE IMPERVIOUS TO DAMAGE. CAN YOU, YOU KNOW, DO YOU PLAY IT NOW AND THEY TELL YOU HOW TO WIN?
NO.
Jon: SO YOU STILL GET BLOWN UP. DO YOU PLAY THEM?
BASICALLY. NO, I DON'T PLAY THEM.
Jon: NO, BUT THE KIDS DO.
YEAH, THE KIDS DO. I'VE TRIED THEM, I'M NO GOOD AT THEM. I GO IN THE FIRST ROOM. YES, COME ON, YES. AND THEY'RE SHOOTING AT ME. THEY'RE SHOOTING AT ME, JON.
Jon: YEAH.
I GET KILLED AND I HAND THE CONTROL BACK.
Jon: IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE BIG DRAWBACKS IN THESE GAMES. IS THAT THEY'RE RELENTLESSLY TRYING TO DESTROY YOU.
YEAH. THEY KEEP SHOOTING AT YOU ALL THE TIME.
Jon: I JUST, I FIND IT FASCINATING, LIKE FOR ME THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD RATHER BE THAN A POP STAR, THAN A ROCK STAR. TO ME IT'S SUCH A MAGICAL WAY OF EXPRESSING YOURSELF. YOU KNOW, COMEDY IS SO LINEAR. IT'S LANGUAGE. EVERYONE KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO'S FUNNY. NOT EVERYBODY -- MUSIC IS SUCH A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, MORE ABSTRACT LANGUAGE. IT'S SHOCKING TO ME TO KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT THAT GOOD AT THAT YOU THINK TO YOURSELF IT WOULD BE FUN TO BE GOOD AT THAT.
WHAT'S THAT? [LAUGHING]
Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO THE ROCK -- ARE YOU GOING TO GO WHEN RINGO'S GHOST BALL THING?
I AM. YEAH, I DEFINITELY AM, YEAH. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
Jon: IT'S VERY EXCITING. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. AND THAT'S, SO NOW, YOU'RE IN, HE'S IN. EVERYONE IS IN. YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE I'LL GO. IT'S IN NEW YORK, IS IT NOT? DON'T THEY DO THE CEREMONY IN NEW YORK?
DO THEY? I DON'T KNOW. I WILL FIND OUT THOUGH BEFORE THE NIGHT.
Jon: YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU GO. THEY JUST POINT YOU IN A DIRECTION.
I DON'T.
Jon: AS FAR AS YOU KNEW, YOU WERE COMING ON LETTERMAN, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS "ELLEN." [LAUGHING]
Jon: I KNEW IT! NOW YOU CAN BUY THIS ON iTUNES. IT'S ALSO FEATURED IN "DESTINY" YOU CAN BUY THAT AS WELL. BUT COME ON IT'S PAUL MCCARTNEY.
