WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNING ACTOR APPEARS IN HBOs NEW DOCUMENTARY FILM ABOUT HIS FATHER CALLED "REMEMBERING THE ARTIST, ROBERT DE NIRO SENIOR."
HE WAS THE REAL THING. MY FATHER. I SEE HIS WORK, I SEE  HOW DEDICATED HE WAS. HE WAS, TO ME, A GREAT ARTIST. BUT, YOU CAN NEVER IMPOSE THAT ON PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. THE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE HAS DONE, ALL OF HIS WORK, I CAN'T NOT BUT MAKE SURE IT'S HELD UP AND REMEMBERED. SO I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM GET HIS DUE. THAT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, ROBERT DE NIRO. [ APPLAUSE ]
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, THANK YOU.
I'M GOING TO GET TWO THINGS OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE WE GET TO THIS VERY MOVING DOCUMENTARY ABOUT YOUR FATHER, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. NUMBER ONE, I WAS ASKED EARLIER WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ROBERT DE NIRO MOVIE. I SAID WHATEVER ROBERT SAYS.
PEOPLE ASK ME. BUT, I -- I HAVE A FAVORITES FOR REASONS AND FAVORITES FOR OTHERS.
I SEE. I WILL GO WITH "GOOD FELLOWS."
OKAY.
NUMBER TWO, THE TRIBUTE TO DON RICKLES. IT WAS A BEAUTIUL NIGHT. YOU AND MARTIN SCORSESE CAME ON, YOU DID A TRIBUTE TO DON THAT WAS REALLY SO FUNNY. ALL THE COMEDIANS AFTERWARDS, WE WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT IT, WE WERE ANGRY AT YOU TWO.
WELL, THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT.
WORK MY WHOLE LIFE. YOU WALK OUT THERE ONE NIGHT AND BOOM YOU KILL IT. NUMBER THREE, THIS MOVIE THIS FILM. I HAVE SEEN YOUR FATHER'S ART WORK IN THE HOTEL IN GREENWICH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I DID NOT REALIZE THE EXTENT THAT HE WAS ON THE VANGUARD OF ARTISTIC MOVEMENTS IN AMERICA IN THE 1940s.
YA, HE WAS A WELL REGARDED YOUNG ARTIST ON THE UPSWING, IF YOU WILL. WELL RESPECTD AND SO ON. THEN HE WENT TO EUROPE FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS. AND, THINGS CHANGED DURING THAT TIME. SO, THE DOCUMENTARY EXPLAINS IT ALL.
RIGHT.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ART SCENE.
DID YOU RESPECT HIS INTEGRITY, THOUGH, TO NOT CHASE HIS TAIL. THERE WAS NEVER A MOMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW, HIS WORK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IT'S CONSISTENT AND BEAUTIFUL. THERE ISN'T A MOMENT WHERE HE'S LIKE WHAT IF I PAINT SOUP CANS. THROW IN A CARTOON SUPERMAN AND DO A COUPLE OF THINGS.
NO, HE FELT STRONGLY THAT WAS NOT, THAT WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE FELT. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE FELT. PERIOD. HE DIDN'T EVEN WANT -- DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE YOUR FATHER. IN A FIELD OF ARTISTRY. THINGS BEING JUDGED SUBJECTIVELY TO SEE HIM GO THROUGH DISTRESS ON IT. YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THINK OH, REJECTION. I WANT TO GET IN ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. LET ME GO INTO THE ARTS. WAS THERE EVER A MOMENT YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF, I CAN'T, I'M LOOKING AT WHAT THIS TYPE OF SUBJECTIVITY DOES TO MY FATHER. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DEAL WITH THAT.
NO, I NEVER EQUATED THE TWO. WHAT I WOULD GO THROUGH AS AN ACTOR, YOUNG ACTOR, GOING TO AUDITIONS. I ALWAYS LOOKED AT IT OPTIMISTICALLY. I SAY IF YOU DON'T GO YOU NEVER KNOW. HAVE TO GO TO AUDITIONS. YOU KNOW YOU WON'T GET THE PART. YOU HAVE TO GO IN THERE AND HANG IN THERE. IT WAS NOT, IT WAS JUST FOR ME, I DIDN'T THINK OF HIM. I DIDN'T THINK OF HIM, I GUESS I HAD TO IN SOME WAYS, BEING REJECTED WHEN I SAW THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY AND ESPECIALLY  WHEN I WENT TO EUROPE AND MADE HIM COME BACK. I FELT IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO THAT. SO, YA.
DID YOUR SUCCESS EVER COMPLICATE THINGS WITH HIM.
HE WAS PROUD OF ME, OF COURSE. HE -- HE MIGHT OF FELT FROM TIME TO TIME HERE AND THERE WISH HE HAD SUCCESS, BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A VERY LOVING FATHER AND PROUD. YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST WHAT IT WAS.
IT'S SO INTERESTING TO WATCH A PROUD SON TALK ABOUT HIS FATHER'S WORK IN THE WAY THAT YOU DO. THEN TO SEE IT, YOU HAVE THE HOTEL IN GREENWICH, A LOT OF HIS WORK IS UP. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
IT MUST -- WHAT IS THE FEELING OF BEING ABLE THROUGH YOUR PLATFORM TO EXPOSE HIS WORK?
WELL, I FEEL IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS, DO YOU NOT SHOW ART IN A GALLERY? THIS AND THAT. I SAID I WANT TO SHOW MY FATHER'S WORK. IT SHOULD BE SEEN. I HAVE THESE RESTAURANTS, HOTEL, THESE PLACES TO PUT IT IN. NOT ALL OF THEM BUT CERTAIN PLACES WHERE I FEEL, I ASKED HIM TO DO THE MENU FOR THE GRILL. HE DID IT. I DIDN'T THINK HE WOULD WANT TO. HE'S VERY PARTICULAR. I ASKED HIM TO PUT PAINTINGS UP. HE DID. HE HUNG THEM HIMSELF IN THE BACK, THE BIG ONES.
HE DID IT HIMSELF.
YA. AND I EVEN THOUGHT MAYBE, I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR HE WOULD GO EVERY WEEK OR TWO HE'D GO WITH FRIENDS AND SIT IN BOOTHS IN THE BACK AND HE WAS SORT OF PROUD OF WHAT THERE WAS THERE. I KNEW HOW PARTICULAR HE WAS. SO, I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT.
YA.
ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS PASSING AWAY. THE MENUS ARE THE SAME. EVERYTHING IS THE SAME. I NEVER CHANGED THAT. IT'S THERE FOR ME, ETERNITY.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YOU GET HIS VOICE IN YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU PUT HIS STUFF UP AND THINK HE WON'T LIKE THAT, HE WANTS IT LIKE THIS. I KNOW HOW HE IS.
CERTAIN THINGS HE DIDN'T -- HE WAS SUSPICIOUS OF DEALERS AND I GUESS LIKE AN ACTOR SUSPICIOUS OF CERTAIN PRODUCERS OR STUDIOS. IT'S THE SAME THING. I DON'T EQUATE HIS EXPERIENCE WITH MINE IF I EVER HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST -- I KNEW, I WAS HAPPY BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY THAT HE WAS ACCEPTING OF THIS, WHAT I WANTED TO DO. IF I, FOR EXAMPLE, IF HE WAS ALIVE I WOULD OF HAD HIM DO THE CREDITS TO A MOVIE. ODDLY -- COINCIDENCELY, IT'S TERRIFIC, THIS GUY WAS FOLLOWING HIM AROUND IN THE 70s WITH A SUPER 8 CAMERA HE DID, AS YOU SEE IN THE MOVIE. HE WRITES "FIN." HE JUST DID THAT FOR THE FILM. BUT IT WORKS NICELY FOR THE DOCUMENTARY.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL. A WONDERFUL GIFT HE GAVE TO YOU. IT'S A WONDERFUL GIFT YOU GAVE TO HIM AS WELL. SO REALLY, IT'S QUITE LOVELY. REMEMBERING ARTIST ROBERT DE NIRO SENIOR. IT PREMIERES MONDAY, JUNE 9th AT 9 PM ON HBO.
IT'S ROBERT DE NIRO.
