Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, A DIRECTOR, HER LATEST FILM IS "SELMA."
TAKE YOUR SPOT.
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
YOU'RE ALL DELIBERATELY CAUSING AN OBSTRUCTION. YOU DON'T DISPERSE,  YOURE GOING TO BE ARRESTED. I PROMISE YOU.
SHERIFF CLARK, WE ARE TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE REGISTRATION OFFICE, WHICH IS OUR LEGAL RIGHT.
THERE ARE TOO MANY OF YOU. YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THERE IS. NOW Y'ALL ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT AT THE REAR.
NO SHERIFF CLARK. WE'RE GOING IN THE FRONT. WE'RE GOING TO WAIT RIGHT HERE. SEGREGATION IS NOW ILLEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY, SIR.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME AVA DUVERNAY. HELLO! [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
HEY!
Jon: FIRST OF ALL. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FILM.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND SO WELL DONE.
I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO.
Jon: OH I ABSOLUTELY. I WAS INCREDIBLY MOVED. THE LEAD PERFORMANCE, DAVID OYELOWO?
IT'S JUST OYELOWO.
Jon: OYELOWO
O, YELLOW, O.
Jon: O, YELLOW, O.
YEAH. YELLOW WITH TWO Os.
Jon: YELLOW WITH TWO Os. REMARKABLE.
HE'S AMAZING. HE'S AMAZING. WE GOT TO KNOW THE NAME BECAUSE THIS GUY IS GOING PLACES. WE'VE GOT TO LEARN IT NOW.
Jon: HE'S ALREADY GONE PLACES.
YEAH HE IS. YES.
Jon: IN THIS FILM.  HOW DOES IT FEEL TO PRESENT A STORY LIKE THIS NOW THAT RACISM IS OVER? IS IT, IS IT --  [ Laughter ] TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT IT AS A PART OF OUR LEARNED AND SHARED HISTORY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: THAT WE NO LONGER DEAL WITH.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, IT'S INTERESTING, BECAUS, YOU KNOW, WE OPENED THE FILM WITH KING ACCEPTING THE NOBEL PRIZE.
Jon: YES.
AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWERS. AND AT THAT TIME IF YOU READ, YOU KNOW, A COMMENTARY AND COLUMNISTS AT THAT TIME WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE HAD GOTTEN PAST RACISM BECAUSE HE HAD GOTTEN THE NOBEL PRIZE.
Jon: YES.
I MEAN, THIS IS THE, THIS POST-RACIAL THING, IS NOT NEW.
Jon: YEAH.
THE IDEA THAT THAT ONE ACHIEVEMENT, YOU KNOW, JUST KIND OF CLEANS THE SLATE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. SO, IT'S INTERESTING. AND THESE EVENTS TOOK PLACE 50 YEARS AGO.
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THE WAY THAT YOU PORTRAYED HIS PRAGMATISM. BECAUSE IT HUMANIZES HIM TO A LARGE EXTENT IN THAT HE CHOSE CERTAIN MOMENTS FOR THEIR CINEMATIC QUALITY AT TIMES. HE HAD TO BE CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT MOMENTS COULD REPRESENT HIS HIGHEST ASPIRATION, AND YOU SHOW HIM SUFFERING AS HE WATCHES INDIVIDUALS BEING PUNISHED FOR THAT CHOICE.
YEAH, I MEAN, DURING THE SELMA MARCHES WERE REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE DIED UNDER KING'S WATCH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE THREE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES DURING THE SELMA CAMPAIGNS, AND SO THAT WAS A GREAT WEIGHT UPON HIM, A GREAT GUILT THAT HE WAS CARRYING. YOU KNOW, NONVIOLENT THEORY, RESULTING IN VIOLENT DEATH. AND SO, THAT'S WHY THIS, THIS, THIS TIME IN HIS HISTORY IS JUST SO RIPE, SO ROBUST FOR EXPLORATION.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THE BIG CONTROVERSY IS THAT LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON IS NOT ENOUGH OF A HERO IN THIS. DOES IT SURPRISE YOU, BECAUSE IN THE FILM, I MEAN, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, WHEN I READ THE CONTROVERSY I EXPECTED THE FILM, FOR HIM TO BE A VILLAINOUS. HE IS IN NO WAY THAT. HE'S A POLITICIAN.
YEAH I KNOW.
Jon: I'M A LITTLE BAFFLED NOW.
I'M DOING THE SAME THING AS YOU ARE. I MEAN, LITERALLY PEOPLE CHEER IN THE THEATER FOR LBJ AT THE END OF IT. I MEAN, I'M A LITTLE BAFFLED AS TO WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE. BUT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO THEIR OPINION. I MEAN, THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE DON'T PAINT ANYONE AS A SAINT IN THIS, WE DON'T PAINT ANYONE AS A SINNER.
Jon: TELL ME ABOUT YOUR ESTEEM FOR DR. KING AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS. DOES IT ENHANCE IT IN ANY WAY? WERE THERE SOBERING MOMENTS TO IT? ULTIMATELY WHAT'S YOUR FEELING THROUGH THAT?
I THINK, YOU KNOW, MY FEELING BEFORE WAS THAT I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM AND I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THAT WAS. IT VERY COMPARTMENTALIZED. A BRAVE MAN, A COURAGEOUS MAN, BUT NOT REALLY A MAN, YOU KNOW, REALLY AN IDEA. YOU KNOW, HE BELIEVED IN NONVIOLENCE, HE HAD A DREAM, HE BELIEVED IN PEACE, HE DIED. THOSE ARE THE BROAD STROKES OF WHAT I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ABOUT HIM. AND HE WAS A RADICAL, HE WAS A CHARISMATIC, HE WAS DYNAMIC, HE WAS A STRATEGIST, HE WAS A TACTICIAN, HE WAS A PRANKSTER, HE WAS GUILTY, HE HAD EGO, HE WAS LIKE ME, HE WAS LIKE YOU. AND I GAINED SO MUCH -- YOU DON'T HAVE EGO?
Jon: NO, I JUST, LIKE WHEN YOU SAID LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING, HE WAS LIKE YOU, NO. YOU'RE LIKE NO, I DON'T,  I DON'T --
BUT NO, I MEAN, I WOULD ARGUE --
Jon: I'LL SAY LIKE, I'LL GIVE YOU PRANKSTER.
I WOULD ARGUE THAT HE IS. BECAUSE HE WAS JUST A BROTHER FROM ATLANTA WHO GOT SWEPT UP IN HISTORY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WAS ABLE TO STEP IN TO THAT GREATNESS, BUT TRULY HE WAS A HUMAN BEING, AND THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO PAINT.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S SO INTERESTING TOO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT STARTS OUT WHERE HE'S STEPPING ON TO THE STAGE WITH THE NOBEL CEREMONY AND HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE TRAPPINGS OF THIS NEW FOUND AND WORRIED HOW IT WILL MAKE HIM APPEAR. AND YOU NEVER SORT OF THINK OF THAT ASPECT OF HIM IN THE THIRD PERSON GOING, HEY, I REPRESENT THIS, I CAN NO LONGER BE THIS.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: IT'S AS THOUGH HE CAME TO SEE HIMSELF AS A MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURE AS WELL.
RIGHT, WELL HE KNEW WHAT HE MEANT TO PEOPLE.
Jon: RIGHT.
ON BOTH SIDES OF IT. YOU KNOW, FOR, FOR, FOR FOLKS THAT WERE NOT, YOU KNOW, STEEPED IN THE CULTURE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR, HE WAS, IT WAS A SAFETY TO HIM.
Jon: RIGHT.
SOME OF THEM SAW HIM AS SAFE. SOME OF THEM SAW HIM AS DANGEROUS, BUT NOT AS DANGEROUS AS MALCOLM X.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW. SO, HE WAS THE SAFER --
Jon: VERY INTERESTING HOW THAT IS PORTRAYED WITH LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON.
THAT'S IN THE FILM AS WELL. THAT'S CORRECT.
Jon: WHO'S SAYING, YOU KNOW, IF WE DON'T LET DR. KING WORK, MALCOM X --
THEN WHAT'S OUR OPTION.
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE'RE SOME INTERESTING IDEAS IN THERE, AND I WOULD JUST INVITE PEOPLE NOT TO DISMISS IT BASED ON THE CHALLENGES THAT A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CUSTODIANS OF ONE MAN ARE RILING UP. I THINK THERE'S, THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF --
Jon: I HOPE THEY DON'T. IT IS MOVING AND COMPLEX AND THE NARRATIVE -- THE LYNDON B. JOHNSON IS THE LEAST INTERESTING. IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT DID THAT MARCH IN SELMA. IT'S ABOUT THEIR COURAGE AND STRUGGLE, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
OH I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO.
Jon: AND I CONGRATULATE YOU TO THE HIGH HEAVENS FOR IT.
OH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: REALLY LOVELY WORK.
THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE.
"SELMA" IS IN THEATERS EVERYWHERE ON FRIDAY. AVA DUVERNAY. [ Cheering and Applause ]
