( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT BESTSELLING AUTHOR WHO HAS EDITED ALSO A NEW E-BOOK CALLED "BEYOND BIN  LADEN." HE HAS EDITED A NEW COLLECTION OF ESSAYS, CALLED "AMERICAN  HOMER" INCLUDED AS A NEW VOLUME IN THE CLASSIC CIVIL WAR NARRATIVE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, JOHN MEACHAM. ( APPLAUSE ) THIS IS A RE-RELEASE OF SHELBY FOOT'S FAMED CIVIL WAR TRILOGY.
YES.
Jon: IT ACTUALLY COMES NOW IN ITS OWN REAL, HISTORIC CIVIL WAR OVEN THAT THEY USE.
YES.
Jon: AND YOU CONTRIBUTED--
THEY WERE FORGED AT AN TEATUM.
Jon:.
Jon: IT IS THREE PRET GOOD VOLUMES. I'M SHOW THEM. THIS IS ONE... ( LAUGHTER ) THIS IS TWO... AND THIS IS THREE...
YEAH.
Jon: AND THEN YOU CONTRIBUTED THIS.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) YOU KNOW HOW LONG THIS TOOK? SGLON HOW LONG?
OH, MAN, LONG. LONG TIME. LONG TIME.
Jon: DID YOU HAVE TO SEND OUT THE E-MAIL-- "HEY, MAN, COULD  YOU WRITE ME AN ESSAY ON THE CIVIL WAR THEY COULD PUT IN MY PAMPHLETS?"
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK TO DO WITH MY THUMBS.
Jon: THIS IS AN AMAZING TRILOGY. I HAPPEN TO BE AN ENORMOUS FAN OF THE CIVIL WAR.
DO YOU HAVE THE FRANKLIN MINT ONE WITH THE LITTLE SOLDIERS?
Jon: WELL, LOOK AT YOU. I DO HAVE THE CIVIL WAR CHESS SET. IT'S A REGULAR CHESS SET-- I JUST PAINTED PEOPLE'S FACES ON IT. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT ARE-- ARE THERE SOME REVELATIONS IN HERE, REFLECTIONS  IN THE AMERICAN HOME THEY'RE ARE INTERESTING TO ADD TO THE CANON?
I THINK SO. READING THE BOOKS, AS YOU KNOW, TAKES ABOUT AS LONG AS THE WAR DID.
Jon: YES. AND WE LOSE ABOUT AS MANY MEN.
EXACTLY. ( LAUGHTER ) PRECISELY. BUT I THINK SHELBY FOOT WAS PROBABLY THE UNCREDITED FIRST NEW JOURNALIST. HE WAS A FELLA WHO-- HE WAS A NOVELIST. HE BROUGHT NOVELISTIC CINEMATIC TECHNIQUES TO NONFICTION BEFORE A LOT OF PEOPLE DID. AND SO THERE'S A LINE, REALLY, FROM WHAT FOOT DID TO TEDDY WHITE IN "MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT" TO BOB WOODWARD. REALLY, WE ACCEPT THAT GENRE NOW AS PART OF THE WALLPAPER, BUT FOOT WAS WORKING VERY EARLY ON. IT STARTED OUT AS AN 18-MONTH PROJECT. THEN THE HEAD OF THE RANDOM HOUSE WROTE FOOT HE LIKED HIS NOVELS. HE SAID YOU WANT TO DO A QUICK HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR? ( LAUGHTER ) AT 150,000 WORDS. THIS IS 1.5
Jon: RIGHT. AND HE WROTE--
HE WROTE IT-- HE COULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED ABOUT THREE TIMES. SO HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN A MONK-- WELL, ANYWAY, THAT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC. HE WROTE IN THIS AMAZING HANDWRITING AND THEN WOULD TYPE IT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. HE DID IT IN MEMPHIS IN THIZ HOUSE THERE. BEST FRIEND WAS WALKER PERCY, GREAT FRIENDS WITH ROBERT PIN WARREN. AND FINISHED-- PUBLISHED THE FIRST ONE IN 1958, AND FINISHED 30 YEARS-- 22 YEARS LATER. IT TOOK FOUR-- FIVE TIMES AS LONG AS THE WAR.
Jon: RIGHT.
TO DO THIS.
Jon: HE FINISHED IN 1970...
1-2.
Jon: I REMEMBER I WAS JUST A KID, 10 YEARS OLD, AND I REMEMBER HEARING A FAINT, YEE-HA! I JUST REMEMBER HEARING VERY QUIETLYUE COULD TELL IT WAS FROM DOWN SOUTH. "I CAN'T BLEEBL IT'S ( BLEEP ) OVER." ( LAUGHTER ) BESIDES THIS--
WE HEARD THAT A LOT. WHERE I CAME FROM.
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. I KNOW. HOW DID YOU EDIT AN E-BOOK ON THE FUTURE OF TERROR, OSAMA BIN LADEN'S DEATH. IT JUST HAPPENED ON MONDAY.
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED AN INSTANT BOOK.
Jon: ARE THEY ESSAYS-- WERE THEY WRITTEN PRIOR?
NO.
Jon: THESE WERE WRITTEN POST?
THIS IS VERY EXCITING. THIS IS RANDOM HOUSE'S FIRST INSTANT E-BOOK. IT'S CALLED "BEYOND BIN LADEN." WE HAVE RICHARD HAAS, THE HEAD  OF THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS. DANIEL MARKEY, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS. KAREN HUGHES, LOOKING AT IT FROM THE "W" WORLD. JIM BAKER COMPARING THE WAR ON TERROR TO THE COLD WAR. AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU SORT OF CRACKED THE CODE ON MY EDITORIAL METHOD A FEW MINUTES AGO. I SHOULDN'T UNDERSCORE IT-- BUT YOU SEND AN E-MAIL AND YOU ASK.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE AN AGGREGATEOR.
HAROLD ROTH AT LEAST HAD TO WRITE LETTERS. NOW ALL WE DO IS-- NOW ALL WE DO IS E-MAILS.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO WE HIT IT HARD ON MONDAY, AND YOU CAN PRE-ORDER IT NOW.
Jon: DOES IT GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE NOW ON WHAT HIS DEATH WILL MEAN TO THE WAR ON TERROR?
YES. THE SCENE THAT EMERGED ORGANICALLY IS PAKISTAN, OBVIOUSLY. YOU HAVE A COUNTRY HERE THAT-- I DIDN'T KNOW THIS DETAIL-- THAT  IN 50 YEARS, IT'S ANTICIPATED TO BE THE FOURTH LARGEST NATION IN  THE WORLD, U.S., CHINA, INDIA, PAKISTAN, 180 MILLION PEOPLE. WITH THIS WEAK GOVERNMENT, THIS SENSE OF INFERIORITY, SENSE OF INSECURITY, THAT LEADS TO THE  RADICALISM, AND PROVIDING THESE SANCTUARIES. AND --
WELL, THEY HAVE DENIED THAT THE ISI IS IN ANY WAY LINKED TO THIS TYPE OF THING, AND I, FOR  ONE, WHY WOULD THEY LIE? WHY? ( LAUGHTER ) WHY WOULD THEY DOWNPLAY IT? THEY FEEL BADLY FOR, YOU KNOW, THE SPLIT NOW IN THE PAKISTANI CULTURE. I MEAN, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS SPLIT THERE. THERE'S A MODERN CULTURE MOVING FORWARD, VERY DYNAMIC, VERY EDUCATED, WANT TO WORK. AND THEN THERE IS THIS REAL FUNDAMENTALIST STLEEK IS VERY INFILTRATED INTO THE SPECIAL  FORCES, THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
AND IT'S HONE COMBED IN THE WRONG PLACES. IT'S IN THE ISI, IT'S IN THE MILITARY. AND UNDERSCORES THE INTRACTIBILITY IN MANY WAYS OF THIS. AND WHAT THE BOOK REALLY, I THINK, UNDERSCORES AS WELL IS DEATH OF BIN LADEN, WELCOMED, LONG OVERDUE. WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ENTIRELY SYMBOLIC YET. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY FOUND IN THOSE COMPUTERS. I THINK EVERYBODY'S BEEN TOO QUICK --
SYMBOLS MEAN SOMETHING BUT IT CERTAINLY IS NOT A TACTICAL VICTORY IN THE SENSE OF--
BUT WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE THEY FOUND A LOT OF STUFF IN THE HOUSE.
Jon: WE DO KNOW. YOU PUT OUT AN E-BOOK.
WE KNOW IT'S BEYOND HIM. WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS IT'S DECENTRALIZED. THEY'RE ALL LIKE TERRORIST BURGER KINGS, FRANCHISEES. WE DON'T KNOW HOW INVOLVED BIN LADEN HAS BEEN AND WE MAY NOW FROM THE INTELLIGENCE GATHERED. I THINK THAT'S THE GREAT THING TO WATCH GOING FORWARD.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, AND YOU JUST WROTE YOURSELF A GREAT McDONALD'S COMMERCIAL. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE RONALD McDONALD FIGHTING TERRORIST BURGER KING. THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE CIVIL WAR, SHELBY FOOT PUT IN PERSPECTIVE. 150 YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR WE FINALLY LEARN A LITTLE BIT OF ITS MEANING AND THE WAR ON  TERROR, YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IN FOUR DAYS AFTER DEATH OF BIN LADEN.
IT TOOK JESUS THREE DAYS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: ON THE BOOKSHELFS NOW. JOHN MEACHAM.
