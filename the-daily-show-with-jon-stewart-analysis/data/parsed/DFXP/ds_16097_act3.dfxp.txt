Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS. HER NEW FILM IS CALLED "THE WHISTLEBLOWER."
I'M LOOKING FOR A GIRL. THE POLICE DROPPED HER HERE A FEW HOURS AGO. CAN YOU CHECK? SHE'S 15 YEARS OLD, NO PASSPORT.
OKAY. OKAY. THAT'S EASY. I KNOW WHAT YOU LOOK FOR. THOSE GIRLS DO NOT GO THROUGH. THEY GO FOR DEATH TO SERBIA.
GEEZ. [LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM RACHEL WEISZ. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU. SECOND OF ALL, BOY, THIS IS A HEAVY PIECE. IS THIS... THE U.N. SOLDIER, IS THIS A TRUE STORY?
IT'S INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY OF A REAL WOMAN.
Jon: AND SHE WAS ATTEMPTING TO... THERE WAS I GUESS SEX TRAFFICKING OF UNDERAGE WOMEN BY  U.N. SOLDIERS, PEACEKEEPERS?
SHE WAS PEACEKEEPER AND WENT TO BOSNIA AND SHE SLOWLY UNCOVERED THIS HUGE SCANDAL. I MEAN, THERE WAS CORRUPTION AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL BY THE PRIVATE CONTRACTING COMPANY THAT  HIRED HER, BY THE U.N., BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT, BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. I MEAN, THERE WERE LAYER POINTS. IT WAS AN OLD-FASHIONED THRILLER. IT'S SOMEONE TRYING TO UNRAVEL A WEB OF DECEIT AND LIES.
Jon: I AM GOING TO LOSE FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS IF THIS TYPE OF THING...
NO, JON, YOU? SURELY NOT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SURELY THE U.N. MISMANAGED MILITARY CONTRACTORS IN A WAR-TORN NATION. I'M REALLY SOMEWHAT UPSET. NOW, WERE YOU ABLE TO FILM...
IN BOSNIA, NO. WE FILMED IN ROMANIA. SO BUCHAREST DOUBLED FOR LATE '90s BOSNIA.
Jon: I HAVE BEEN TO BUCHAREST IN THE EARLY '90s OR LATE '80s I SPENT AN HOUR LAYOVER. [LAUGHTER]
IN THE AIRPORT, YEAH.
Jon: BEAUTIFUL LAVATORIES. THE DETAIL ON THE TILE. SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT STALIN, THE MAN KNEW THAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO...
IT'S GOT TO LOOK GOOD AROUND YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU.
I'M WITH YOU.
Jon: YOU WANT SOME PEACE. HOW LONG WERE YOU IN BUCHAREST? HAVE YOU SPENT TIME THERE PREVIOUSLY?
I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE. WE WERE THERE SIX WEEKS. IT WAS A LOW-BUDGET MOVIE.
Jon: WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING A MOVIE SUCH AS THIS AND IT'S VERY  POLITICALLY CHARGED, IS THERE INTERFERENCE? DO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF CASE, ARE THEY AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING? ARE THEY TRYING TO STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING? IS THERE ANY... OR EVERYBODY IS JUST OUT THERE?
NO ONE BOTHERS IN ROMANIA. WE CHANGE THE NAMES OF A LOT OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED. WE CHANGE THE NAME OF THE PRIVATE CONTRACTING COMPANY. I THINK THE REAL NAME, THE INSURANCE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE  BUDGET OF THE FILM. SO IT'S KIND OF INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY. A LOT OF THE NAMES CHANGED AND THE EVENTS KIND OF INCORPORATED INTO DIFFERENT MOMENTS.
Jon: SO YOU'RE BASICALLY IN BUCHAREST DRIVING U.N. TRUCKS FILMING THE SEQUEL. NOTHING GOING ON HERE TO BE SEEN OR SEE OR ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SOMEONE WAS TELLING ME THERE'S A WIZARD OF OZ PREQUEL.
YES, YES, I'M FILMING IT RIGHT NOW IN DETROIT.
Jon: WHAT? [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S AWESOME.
YES, DETROIT.
Jon: ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY FOLLOWED THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD. I KNEW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD LED SOMEWHERE NEAR DETROIT. I JUST WASN'T SURE. THAT'S NICE, THOUGH, BECAUSE THAT'S A CITY... AS MUMP AS LOS  ANGELES NEEDS THE FILM BUSINESS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE DETROIT GET OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE THE FILM BUSINESS. THAT'S A GREAT THING FOR THEM. IS THAT GOING ON RIGHT NOW?
YEAH, SAM RAMI WHO IS DIRECTING IT IS FROM DETROIT. HE'S GONE BACK THE HIS HOME CITY.
Jon: THAT'S GREAT. WHAT FILM HAVE YOU TOLD DETROITERS YOU'RE FILMING TO AVOID INSURANCE ISSUES? HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO CATCH A GAME YET, A TIGERS' GAME?
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. [APPLAUSE]
DO YOU THINK I'M JOKING? I'M NOT.
Jon: THE TIGERS ARE TEAM OF CRICKETERS. IT'S AN AMERICAN PASTIME, BUT BASEBALL...
I'M A CITIZEN.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YEP.
Jon: AND YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANY BASEBALL QUESTIONS?
NO. JON JON WHAT DO THEY WANT FOREIGNERS TO KNOW WHEN THEY BECOME A CITIZEN?
A LOT OF MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS, BUT NOTHING ABSPORTS. NOT ONE SPORT QUESTION.
Jon: WHAT DID THEY ASK ABOUT?
HISTORY, POLITICS.
Jon: PLEASE. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO? WELL, IT'S ALWAYS VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. AND YOU'LL COME BACK FOR THE WIZARD OF OZ PREQUEL BECAUSE I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. IS IT FOR KIDS, TOO?
YES, YES.
Jon: "THE WHISTLEBLOWER" OPENS IN NEW YORK AND L.A. AUGUST 5th. EXPANDS TO OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT AUGUST.
