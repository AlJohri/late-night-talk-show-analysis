WELCOME BACK. NOW THE TRAYVON MART UP CASE  SHOWS THAT RACE REMAINS A  DIFFICULT SUBJECT. REALLY? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? SAM BEE AND JESSICA WILLIAMS  FILED THIS REPORT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED UPON  AMERICANS TO HAVE A FRANK AND  OPEN DISCUSSION ON RACE.
THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT,  SHOULD WE CONVENE A CONVERSATION  ON RACE?
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM. IS COUNTRY IS AFRAID TO  TALK ABOUT RACE.
IT IS STILL VERY DIFFICULT TO  TALK ABOUT RACE.
PEOPLE ARE PETRIFIED TO TALK  ABOUT RACE.
ACCORDING TO PEOPLE ON TV, IT  IS TERRIFYING TO TALK ABOUT  RACE. SO SAM AND I CONVENED TWO  PANELS, ONE FROM THE BLACK  COMMUNITY AND ONE FROM THE WHITE COMMUNITY TO SHOW THAT IT'S  REALLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT AT  ALL.
OH, I'M SORRY. I'M IN THE WRONG PANEL. NO? OH, GOOD. SEE HOW EASY.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE  WANTS US TO TALK ABOUT RACE. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT RACE. YOU GO FIRST.
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU  STARTED OFF.
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE  GREAT AT ALL.
IF YOU'RE SCARED, SAY YOU'RE  SCARED.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) NO, I'M  NOT AT ALL. I'M INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE. INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE PLACE FOR  ME TO BE. FORTUNATELY JESSICA'S PANEL  JUMPED RIGHT IN.
HOW FAR DO YOU GUYS THINK WE  ARE AS A SOCIETY FROM  ELIMINATING RACISM ON A SCALE OF 0% TO 100%.
I'D SAY 50%. WOW, 50%. RACISM IS ALREADY HALF  NONEXISTENT. AS LONG AS EVERYONE SEES IT THAT  WAY. HOW FAR ARE WE TOWARD  ELIMINATING RACISM?
15%. A GOOD 50%. 7%. HEAVENS. THAT'S JUST FOR OBAMA. HE GETS 7%.
WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT. I'LL SAY 75.
NEGATIVE 20. APPARENTLY THE STATE OF RACE  RELATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY IS  SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIS -- ♪ I'VE HEARD IT SAID ♪♪  -- AND THIS. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT RACE IN  AMERICA.
TALK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH. YOU THINK RACE IS TALKED  ABOUT TOO MUCH.
IT IS. THE FACT THAT WE KEEP TALKING  ABOUT THE PROBLEM EXACERBATES  THE PROBLEM.
PERFECT. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT RACE AT  ALL.
THE BLACK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT  RACE ALL THE TIME. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEAL  WITH ALL THE TIME.
WHITE PRIVILEGE AFFECTS EVERY  ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE.
MY WHITE PRIVILEGE? IT'S PART OF YOUR IDENTITY. IT'S AT THE INTERSECTION OF A  LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.
PART OF THE PRIVILEGE OF  BEING WHITE IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO  FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE JUST EXISTING AND THINKING A POLICE OFFICER IS  GOING TO PROFILE YOU FOR WHAT  YOU LOOK LIKE.
HOT IN HERE. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY JUST  A BLACK ISSUE.
YOU SEE LATINOS AND ARABS  BEING PERSECUTED BECAUSE OF THE  COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.
IF THE NAME WAS RASAWN  WILLIAMS THEY WOULD LOCK THIS.   ..
THIS IS CALLED... A CONDITION  THAT CAUSES ME TO SWEAT WHEN I  THINK THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.
IT IS A TINY BIT HARD TO HAVE  THIS CONVERSATION.
WHY BRING IT UP IF IF IT'S  NOT A PROBLEM WITH YOU?
HAS RACE AFFECTED YOUR  ABILITY TO GET JOBS.
I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERVIEWED  BY A BLACK PERSON. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. MAYBE BLACK PEOPLE JUST AREN'T  INTERESTED IN MY JOB. THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE I WORK IN  FASHION.
OH, MID GOD. SO MAYBE NOT EVERYONE IS  SENSITIVE TO RACE ISSUES BUT AT  LEAST WE'RE ALL EQUAL IN THE EYES OF THE LAW.
IN NEW YORK, THERE IS A  POLICY CALLED STOP-AND-FRISK. YOU'RE STOPPED AND SEARCHED. THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY.
HAVE YOU BEEN STOPPED? DEFINITELY. HAVE YOU BEEN STOPPED?  SND. YEP. HAVE YOU BEEN STOPPED? NO. A RANDOM STAMP OF FIVE BLACK  PEOPLE, FOUR OF YOU HAVE BEEN  STOPPED AND FRISKED. BUT NOT YOU.
RIGHT. BUT I JUST MOVED HERE.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN STOPPED  AND FRISKED?
NO. YES. SO YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPED AND  FRISKED.
AT THE AIRPORT. SEE, IT'S NOT THAT THE  CONVERSATION IS IS SO DIFFICULT. IT'S JUST THAT IT'S GOING TO  TAKE A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.
