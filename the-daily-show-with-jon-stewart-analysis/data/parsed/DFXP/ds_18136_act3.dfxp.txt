(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME BACK. OUR GUEST TONIGHT AN  EXCEPTIONALLY FUNNY COMEDIAN  WHOSE ONE MAN SHOW  UNCONSTITUTIONAL IS CURRENTLY PLAYING HERE IN  NEW YORK. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW THE WONDERFUL COLIN  QUINN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELL, WELL, WELL. WHAT A WEB WE WEAVE.
SO UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
YES.
ABOUT THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S CORRECT.
OF COURSE THE SINGLE  GREATEST FOUR PAGE DOCUMENT  IN HISTORY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER ACTUALLY  READ.
YES.
RIGHT?
IT'S GOOD. WHY DO AMERICANS SEE THE  CONSTITUTION AS BEING SO  VOOK SANK?
FIRST OF ALL, DON'T EVER  USE THAT WORD AROUND ME  AGAIN. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU GUYS,  SERIOUSLY, OH, SORRY.
YOU'RE SO GOOD AS ALWAYS  GETTING AN AUDIENCE ON SIDE. YOU ARE SO GOOD.
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.
ARE YOU SO GOOD AT  BURYING YOUR INHERENT  LIKABILITY AND REPLACING IT  WITH A MONSTER. JON SAID NOT TO LET YOU DO  THAT.
PEOPLE FIND ME ARROGANT.
HE WON'T LET DOW THAT HE  SAID IF COLIN PUTS HIS FEET  UP, KICK THEM.
I UNDERSTAND TINGS ARE  NOT GOING WELL ON JON'S  FILM.
THAT'S NOT TRUE. WHY WOULD YOU-- THAT'S NOT  TRUE. DON'T LISTEN TO A WORD HE  SAYS. THIS MAN IS A PROFESSIONAL  LIAR.
I HEARD-- I HEARD SOME  BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM. TYRANNICAL IS THE WORD THEY  USE IN JORDAN, BY THE WAY.
A JORDAN TIR RAN CALL  TLARX SUPPER CASE T ON TIR  RAN CALL.
I'M TRYING TO HELP-U-SELL  YOUR SHOW.
I KNOW THAT.
NEXT WEEK HERE IN NEW  YORK. WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?
JUST HAVING A LITTLE  WITTY WANT WE ARE AN ENGLISH  PERSON HERE IN THE STATES.
WE INVENTED BANTER.
I KNOW YOU DID.
SO I SAW THE SHOW ON  MONDAY.
I KNOW, THANK YOU FOR  COMING.
YOU'RE WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR PERFORMING IT  WITH ME THERE.
THANK YOU.
I REALLY ENJOYED IT. THE THING ABOUT THE  CONSTITUTION IS, DURING THE  CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN  1787 THOMAS JEFFERSON WROTE TO JOHN ADAMS AND SAID IT  REALLY IS AN ASSEMBLY OF  DEMI GODS. THEY WERE NOT SHORT ON  CONFIDENCE WERE THEY.
AND THOSE WHO WEREN'T  EVEN THERE.
THEY WERE IN PARIS AND  LONDON.
MAY I SAY ONE THING, NOT  TO START A CONFLICT BUT THAT  IS WHAT I DO, HOW COME YOU GOT THIS GREAT QUOTE THAT I  NEVER DID EVEN THOUGH I'M  DOING A WHOLE SHOW ON IT. I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT NOW.
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT.
YEAH,.
DEMI GODS. WHICH IS TRUE, IF DEMI GODS  MEANT VERY DRUNK WHITE MEN.
YES.
BECAUSE-- ISN'T THAT WHAT  DEMI GODS MEANS.
THERE WAS A LOT OF  ALCOHOL AT THAT CONVENTION.
THEY WERE GIANT PUNCH  BOWLS FILLED WITH LIQUOR  EVERY DAY. WE HAD A BILL, YOU KNOW,  GOOGLED A BILL ON-LINE OF  THE ORIGINAL BILL.
DID YOU.
THERE IS A LOT MORE --
LIKE I SAID IT WAS JUST A  COPY BUT -- .
IT WAS COOL NEVER THE OLD  DAYS LIKE WE UNEARTHED A  BILL.
THEY WERE REALLY DRINKING  TO SMOOTH THROUGH  NEGOTIATIONS, MAYBE THERE IS A LESSON FOR CONGRESS IN  THAT, JUST GET WASTED.
I TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE  RIGHT.
LET'S COMPROMISE.
YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. BECAUSE LOOK NOWADAYS  CONGRESS WANTS TO GET OUT OF  THERE SO THEY CAN GO DRINK  AND SMOKE. AND THIS WAS, THE INCENTIVE  WAS TO STAY BECAUSE YOU GOT  FREE LIQUOR AND CIGARETTES. I KNOW NOBODY SMOKES NOW BUT  YOU KNOW.
HERE IS ANOTHER QUOTE  WHICH WILL ANNOY YOU. AMERICANS ARE VERY, VERY  DEFENSIVE OF THE  CONSTITUTION. BUT THE FOUNDERS, THE  FOUNDERS DIDN'T SEE THAT. WHAT BEN FRANKLIN, BENJAMIN,  MR. FRANKLIN SAID THERE ARE  SEVERAL PARTS OF THIS  CONSTITUTION WHICH I DO NOT AT PRESENT APPROVE BUT I'M  NOT SURE, I SHALL NEVER  APPROVE THEM. THEN HE SAID HE WOULD ACCEPT  THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE I  EXPECT NO BETTER AND BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE IT IS NOT THE  BEST. WHAT A RINGING ENDORSEMENT  THAT WAS. MY NAME IS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN  AND I KIND OF APPROVE THIS  MESSAGE.
RIGHT.
WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE  ARE LIKE SIX DOUBLE  NEGATIVES IN THERE HE WAS  ALSO A BIG SEX CUB GUY TLARX IS THE OTHER THING I FOUND  OUT.
YOU TRY TO READ ALL THE  DEEP PROFOUND THINGS ABOUT  THESE GUYS AND YOU SEE SEX CLUB AND I SPEND 20 MINUTES  I WANT TO READ ABOUT THAT.
THAT SHOWS YOU CAN TAKE  THE MAN OUT OF THE  MASSACHUSETTS BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE MASSACHUSETTS OUT  OF THE MAN.
I DON'T GET THAT BUT I'M  GOING ALONG WITH IT ANYWAYS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE  STUPID. I'M LIKE HA, GOOD ONE, JOHN. I DON'T KNOW. ALL PRESIDENTS CLAIM TO BE  BIG DEFENDERS OF THE  CONSTITUTION BUT I THINK WE  KNOW DEEP DOWN THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A BETTER  DEFENDER OF THE FOUNDING  DOCUMENTS THAN NICHOLAS CAGE,  HAVE-- AT THE END OF THE  DAY. AT THE END OF THE DAY. CHORS PLAUS.
HE FOUGHT FOR THEM. HE REALLY --
HE REALLY WOULD HAVE DIED  FOR THEM, YEAH.
IT ENDS THIS RUN ENDS  HERE IN NEW YORK NEXT WEEK  ON FRIDAY.
SURE, THURSDAY. BUT YEAH.
FRIDAY, DO ANOTHER SHOW.
IN ENGLAND IT'S FRIDAY  AND THEN YOU'RE OFF ON TOUR  TO THE 13 COLONIES TOUR.
THE ORIGINAL 13, SUCK IT,  ARKANSAS. NO COLIN FOR YOU.
I LOVED IT I LOVED THE  SHOW, VERY FUNNY. THE CONSTITUTION IS  HILARIOUS, BY THE WAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANKS, JOHN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
COLIN QUINN.
