Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINING. PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINING THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IGNORES SO-CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENCE, BUT THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY REFUSE TO LISTEN TO ALARMISTS.
GLOBAL WARMING IS A TOTAL FRAUD.
A DOG AND PONY SHOW FOR THEIR LIBERAL DONORS.
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES PURSUING THIS GLOBAL WARMING AGENDA.
IT'S REALLY A HOAX.
Jon: A HOAX! IT'S LIKE WAR OF THE WORLDS IF THERE HAD BEEN OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT ALIENS HAD LANDED IN NEW JERSEY. SO THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO FALL FOR LIBERAL LIES ANYMORE. WHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY THEY GOT TO FINALLY HEAR THE FACTS FROM SOME OF THEIR OWN.
THE E.P.A. ADMINISTRATORS FOR FOUR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE URGED LAWMAKERS TO TAKE ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY. THE FORMER E.P.A. ADMINISTRATORS ONCE WORKED FOR RICHARD NIXON, GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND HIS SON AND RONALD REAGAN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NIXON, DOUBLE BUSH, THE GREAT REAGAN HIMSELF, BLESSED BE THY NAME. YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THOSE TITANS OF HISTORY  ARE GONNA GIVE US THE STRAIGHT DOPE. LISTEN UP, TREE-HUGGERS.
WE BELIEVE THERE IS LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE OVER THE PACE AND EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT NO LEGITIMATE DEBATE OVER THE EFFECTS OF THE EARTH'S WARMING OR MAN'S CONTRIBUTION.
THE ISSUE HAS BEEN SETTLED, THE E.P.A. DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY. THE LAW SAYS SO. THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID SO TWICE. THAT MATTER I BELIEVE SHOULD NOW BE PUT TO REST.
Jon: TRAITORS! TRAITORS! BRING ME MY SMELLING TURDS. CLIMATE CHANGE WARNINGS AND E.P.A. EMPOWERMENT COMING FROM ACTUAL REPUBLICANS? THAT'S LIKE BEING TOLD PIZZA CAUSES CANCER BY THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES WHO LOVE PIZZA. IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD FOR G.O.P. SENATORS TO ARGUE WITH THIS.
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST. BUT I'M AN OPTOMETRIST. I SPENT MUCH OF MY LIFE WORKING WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. I WAS A ZOOLOGY MAJOR. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: "SO IF THIS HEARING IS ABOUT A ZEBRA WITH AN ASTIGMATISM, I'M YOUR GUY. I'M YOUR GUY." WELL, AS A MAN WITH A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND THERE, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS HERE DISCREDITS THE PEOPLE WHO DENY CLIMATE CHANGE.
AND I SAID BEFORE THAT THERE'S NOTHING SCIENTIFIC ABOUT DISCREDITING PEOPLE WHO PRESENT CONFLICTING EVIDENCE AND ASK REASONABLE QUESTIONS.
Jon: WELL, LET'S COMPARE THE EVIDENCE AND WE'LL PRESENT IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TO SOMEONE WITH YOUR BACKGROUND. OKAY. HERE WE GO. WHICH OF THESE COASTLINES LOOKS BETTER TO YOU. IS IT A OR B? A OR B? YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE? OKAY. OKAY. I'M AFRAID YOU MAY HAVE WILLFUL BLINDNESS. ONCE WE CORRECT THE PROBLEM, MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT WE HAVE TO REGULATE THE CARBON DIOXIDE THAT'S HEATING THE ATMOSPHERE.
CO2 IS A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH. IT'S NOT PARTICULATES AND NOX AND SOX. IT'S PLANT FOOD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT IS  THE  SINGLE MOST CHARMING WAY I HAVE EVER HEARD SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING SO WRONG. "YOU KNOW, MY PAPPY TOLD ME, IF YOU TICKLE A FROG AND IT WINKS, YOU GIRLFRIEND CAN'T GET PREGNANT." YOU KNOW, THIS GUY IS... HE IS WRONG, BUT HE IS ADORABLE. HE IS WRONG-DORABLE. BUT, WHAT DOES IT MATTER? EVEN IF YOU ACCEPTED THE SCIENCE, YOU'D STILL FIND SOME WAY TO DENIGRATE CLIMATE POLICY, YES?
NOW WE HAVE FIRST ROUND OF A GLOBAL WARMING REGULATIONS, WHICH WILL NATIONALIZE THE ELECTRICITY MARKET AND FORCE AMERICANS TO LIVE OUT THE PRESIDENT'S GREEN DREAM.
Jon: THE PRESIDENT'S GREEN DREAM. BY THE WAY, OBAMA'S GREEN DREAM, TOP-SELLING STRAIN IN COLORADO DISPENSARIES. NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW, REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WON'T LISTEN TO AL GORE, THEY WON'T LISTEN TO  NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, THEY WON'T LISTEN TO BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY. NOW THEY WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN PARTY. THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE SOLUTION TO GET REPUBLICANS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. OBAMA MUST BECOME A GLOBAL WARMING DENIER. HE MUST RIDE UP TO CONGRESS IN A HUMMER WITH A GUN RACK AND TELL THEM, "I WAS WRONG AND YOU ARE RIGHT." WE'D HAVE CAP AND TRADE BY THE MORNING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
