FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW  YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,  MY NAME IS JON--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH,  TONIGHT'S PROGRAM SAY GOOD  ONE, MY GUEST MINDY KALING,  TRIPLE THREAT! WRITER, PRODUCER, STAR. SHE'S VERY SUCCESSFUL. ALTHOUGH SHE WAS VERY  SUCCESSFUL WHEN SHE WAS JUST  ON ITS OFFICE. SHE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR A  VERY LONG TIME. I DON'T KNOW-- I DON'T KNOW  WHAT TO-- LET'S GET TO OUR  TOP STORY TONIGHT. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, AS  THOUGH WE HAVE A TOP STORY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR  CHRIS CHRISTIE, IS LOSING  WEIGHT.
CHRIS CHRISTIE ANNOUNCING  THAT AFTER STRUGGLING WITH  OBESITY FOR YEARS HE REVEALED HE SECRETLY HAD LAP  BAND STOMACH SURGERY.
SOME SAY IT IS A SIGN  WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN  2016. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OF COURSE SOME SAY  THAT. SOME SAY THAT HE'S RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT, IT'S A SURE  SIGN. BECAUSE WHY ELSE WOULD A  50-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH YOUNG  CHILDREN AND A LOVING FAMILY TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS  OBESITY AND EXTEND HIS LIFE. WHY ELSE? IT IS A CLASSIC PRESIDENTIAL  RUN TELL. (LAUGHTER)  GOES BACK TO THE DAYS OF  EISENHOWER WHEN EVERYBODY  KNEW HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE A PRESIDENT. OF COURSE THE PHYSICAL  TRANSFORMATION THAT  EISENHOWER UNDERWENT FORCED  HIM TO CHANGE HIS ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU KNOW WHAT? CAN'T A GUY GET HEALTHY  WITHOUT PROGNOSTICATORS?
OH WHAT DOES IT MEAN. IT MEANS HE DOESN'T FEEL  WELL! AND WANTS TO FEEL BETTER. BUT YOU KNOW, YOUNG CHRISTIE,  IF YOU DO WISH TO BECOME  PRESIDENT, IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN TRIMMING DOWN AN  OCCASIONAL BOUGHTS OF  REASONABLENESS. TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF YOU  MUST HAVE THE REFLEXES OF A  NINJA.
NICE!
Jon: NOW, WHERE WERE WE? (APPLAUSE)  (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY NOW THAT  JOB WOULD BE HANDLED BY  DRONES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, I'M  MAKING THAT UP, YEAH. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE  PRESIDENT, CHRISTIE. WHAT JUST HAPPENED? NO, DID HE-- NO, COULD IT  BE-- IT BE?
A GROUP OF SCHOOLCHILDREN  WAS VISITING IF YOU JERSEY  GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE WHEN THE SPIDER CRAWLED ON HIS  DESK. HE QUICKLY SQUASHED THE  PROBLEM.
Jon: ONLY IT WASN'T AN  ODE SPIDER. IT WAS THE FAMOUS  DR. ARACHNO, WHO WAS AT THAT  MOMENT RUSHING TO CHRISTIE'S  OFFICE TO TELL HIM OF THE CAN SUR-- CANCER CURE  BREAKTHROUGH THAT HE HAD  DISCOVERED. (LAUGHTER)  SADLY, I GUESS BECAUSE OF  CHRIS CHRISTIE, KWAN  CERTIFICATE-- CANCER WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  HONESTLY, I DON'T-- I DON'T  KNOW THAT THAT WAS  DR. ARACHNO. JUST KIDDING. OR THAT HE WAS WORKING, AND  WHY WOULD HE WORK ON HUMAN  CANCER. HE WOULD BE WORK ON SPIDER  CANCER, I WITHOUT THINK, AT  THE TIME. REALLY THE WHOLE THING IS  SOMEWHAT FARFETCHED. THE POINT IS THIS BY THE WAY,  IF YOU WERE CONCERNED AT ALL  THAT GOVERNOR CHRIS YEAUX SET A POOR EXAMPLE FOR THE  CHILDREN WHO WERE VISITING  HIS OFFICE, OR WOULD RUN  AFOUL OF PETA, PLEASE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR SAVED THAT  SPIDER FROM A FAR WORSE  FAITH.
(LAUGHTER)
Jon: YUP. HEY, THEY BRING A SPIDER,  YOU BRING A STAPLER. THAT'S THE JERSEY WAY. (LAUGHTER)  MOVING ON! GOOD ON YA, FROM CRUSHING  SPIDERS TO CRUSHING DREAMS S  THIS REALLY THE SEGUE WE'RE GOING GO WITH? YOU KNOW, WE HEAR THIS ALL  THE TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS SO STUPID. THE FREE MARKET SHOULD RUN  THE COUNTRY. AYN RAND IS THE BEST AUTHOR  EVER, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL MY  SENIOR YEAR. YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  BUT DID YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC  SECTOR HAS NO MONOPOLY ON  RUINING EVERYTHING?
BETWEEN 2009 AND 2010  FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS THAT  WERE WRONGFUL OR IN SOME WAY CONTAINED BANKER ROHR  COMMENCED AGAINST NEARLY 4  MILLION HOMEOWNERS.
Jon: 4 MILLION, IT'S ONLY  2 MILLION HOMES A YEAR. AND THIS IS THE PRIVATE  SECTOR DOING THIS I'M SURE  IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO TRACK THE PAPERWORK OF THE  MORTGAGES AND CORRECT THE  ERRORS.
IT USED TO BE THAT THE  PAPERWORK TRACKING MORTGAGES  WAS EASY TO FIND, FILED AT A LOCAL RECORDERS OFFICE.
Jon: AND REMAINS SO  TODAY. HMMMM? THAT IS YOUR STORY, IS IT  NOT? SINCE THAT SYSTEM IS WORKING  AND PEOPLE WERE VERY HAPPY  WITH IT?
BUT MORE THAN A DECADE  AGO BIG MORTGAGE LENDERS SET  UP THEIR OWN ALTERNATIVE  SYSTEM. IT'S CALLED MERSES, THE  MORTGAGE ELECTRONIC  REGISTRATION SYSTEM.
Jon: YOU'RE KIDDING ME! SO THESE 4 MILLION  FORECLOSURE PROBLEMS, THIS  WAS NO ACCIDENT. THIS WAS--   (LAUGHTER)  MERS. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL RIGHT. SO IT WAS MERS. HOW DOES MERSES WORK.
INSTEAD OF FILING PAPERS  AT A LOCAL COURTHOUSE,  MORTGAGE CHANGES ARE SIMPLY REGISTERED INSIDE THE MERS  COMPUTER. BUT WITH NO OFFICIAL PAPER  TRAIL LENDERS ARE NOW  SCRAMBLING TO PRODUCE  DOCUMENTS TO PROVE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORECLOSE.
Jon: AS IT TURNED OUT THE  BIG BANKS DIDN'T ENJOY  FILLING OUT PAPERWORK. FOR EVERY SINGLE MORTGAGE. THEY WANTED TO REASSIGN OR  SECURITY ADVERTISE SO THEY  FORMED A CONSORTIUM. MORTGAGE DUMPSTER, IF YOU  WILL. (LAUGHTER)
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM  THESE MORTGAGES TO TRADE  ELECTRONICALLY WITHIN THIS CORPORATION, THEY WERE ALL  SHAREHOLDERS OF. THINK OF IT AS A TEA PARTY. BUT INSTEAD OF [BLEEP] YOUR  WIFE, THEY LOSE TRACK OF THE  DEED TO YOUR HOUSE. BUT FEAR NOT--   (APPLAUSE)  FEAR NOT. FEAR NOT, MY SPIDERPHOBIC  FRIENDS. I'M SURE THERE IS A BETTER  NAME FOR THAT BUT I DON'T  KNOW. FEAR NOT, THIS TYPE OF  INEVITABLE FREE MARKET  OVERREACH IS WHY THE  GOVERNMENT MUST MAINTAIN ITS WATCHDOG STATUS GO GET THEM  BOYS.
THE OFFICE OF THE  CONTROLLER OF CURRENCY THE  OCC --.
Jon: OH YEAH, YOU DOWN  WITH OCC, YEAH! THE OFFICE OF THE CONTROLLER  OF THE CURRENCY. BECAUSE THEY SPRUNG INTO  ACTION TO DETERMINE WHICH  HOMES WERE BEING FORECLOSED  UPON INAPPROPRIATELY.
INDEPENDENT FORECLOSURE  REVIEW WAS ESSENTIALLY  HAVING BANKS HIRE  INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS WHO WERE ON BANK PAYROLLS TO  LOOK AT THE BANK'S OWN  RECORDS.
Jon: WE ARE ALONE.
THE WHOLE THING WAS SO  BADLY CONCEIVED FROM THE  BEGINNING, AGAIN, THAT THE OCC FINALLY SAID WE GIVE UP.
ABANDONED FOR BEING TOO  COMPLICATED AND FOR HELPING  ALMOST NO ONE.
Jon: WHICH IS  COINCIDENTALLY THE OCC'S  MOTTO. (LAUGHTER)  SO ULTIMATELY--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU DOWN WITH OCC. SO ULTIMATELY LIKE MOST  INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND  EXTREMELY DESTRUCTIVE  FINANCIAL SCANDALS, THE PERPETRATORS WENT TO JAIL. WENT TO JAIL! I'M A CARD. I AM A RIOT! (LAUGHTER)  THEY PULL TRILLIONS OUT OF  THE ECONOMY AND THEY WENT TO  JAIL. WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS THEY  WENT TO THE CARIBBEAN. (LAUGHTER)  THEY WENT TO THE CARIBBEAN  AFTER PAYING AN INADEQUATE  AND COMPLETELY ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OF $9 BILLION. NO, SERIOUSLY. THEY ADMITTED IT WAS  COMPLETELY ARBITRARY.
TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER  WOULD HAVE REQUIRED WITH  MORE PRECISION WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL DELAY IN  PROVIDING --
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU  PICK A NUMBER OUT OF THE  AIR.
Jon: OH. REALLY? WHAT'S WRONG, SENATOR. DON'T YOU LIKE MAGIC? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'M SORRY THAT  ACTUALLY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE  A NUMBER. (LAUGHTER)  AND I HAVE TERRIBLE  ALLERGIES, SO-- BUT YOU KNOW  WHAT, $9 BILLION WAS THE PERFECT NUMBER BECAUSE IT'S  A BIG ENOUGH NUMBER TO  IMPRESS CONSUMERS, BUT A  SMALL ENOUGH NUMBER TO TEACH THE BANKS NO LESSON  WHATSOEVER. AND IT IS INCREDIBLY  DIVIDABLE ENOUGH TO BE  MEANINGLESS.
OUR VIEWERS ARE LOOKING  AT A FULL SCREEN RIGHT HERE  ABOUT WHAT VICTIMS ARE GOING TO GET.
NOT MUCH.
60% AS YOU SAID WILL GET  $300 BUCKS.
Jon: WHOOO! 300 BUCKS. WHICH IS GOOD IF THE HOME  YOU LOST IS ON THE 16th HOLE  OF A MINIATURE GOLF COURSE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT WITH ALL THAT, WITH  EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED,  WITH FREE MARKET  INCOMPETENCE COUPLED BY GOVERNMENT IRREGULARLATION,  THEY TOP IT ALL OFF WITH ONE  FINAL KICK TO THE HOMEOWNERS'  NUTS.
GOVERNMENT ISSUED CHECKS  TO HOMEOWNERS ARE BOUNCING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AH! SO THAT'S WHY THIS GUY'S  PICTURE IS UP BEHIND THE  REGISTER AT THE BODEGA. (LAUGHTER)
