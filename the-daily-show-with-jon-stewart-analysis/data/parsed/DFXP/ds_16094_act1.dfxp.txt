JULY 21, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OUR GUEST TONIGHT, A YOUNG MAN NAMED SCOTT MILLER. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ON WILLIAM McKINLEY'S ASS. [LAUGHTER] I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT IS "ASSASSINATION." YOU GOT TO STOP ABBREVIATIONING  AROUND HERE, NOT TO SAY THAT WILLIAM McKINLEY DID NOT HAVE A NOTEWORTHY REAR END. FOLKS, WE ARE A MERE 15 AND A HALF MONTHS AWAY FROM WHAT WILL DEFINITELY BE CALLED THE MOST  IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. AN INVERITABLE HERD OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE TREACHEROUS  MIGRATORY JOURNEY TO BECOME THEIR PARTY'S NOMINEE. THEY WILL NEED STRENGTH. THEY WILL NEED AGILITY. THEY WILL NEED LUCK. BUT MOSTLY TO SURVIVE THEY WILL NEED MONEY, [BLEEPED] BOATLOADS OF MONEY.
WE HAVE THE NUMBERS BEHIND YOU. MITT ROMNEY $18.4 MILLION. PAWLENTY $4.4 MILLION. BACHMANN THE SAME. HUNTSMAN $4.2 MILLION. HERMAN CAIN RAISED $2.5 MILLION. GINGRICH $2 MILLION. RICK SANTORY UM NOT SO MUCH, $500,000.
Jon: $500,000 IN THE WAR CHEST. BUH-BYE. [LAUGHTER] SADLY, THAT IMAGE IS STILL ONLY THE SECOND MOST UNPLEASANT IMAGE YOU GET WHEN YOU GOOGLE THE NAME  "SANTORUM." GO AHEAD. DO IT. DO IT RIGHT. NOW I CAN WAIT. NOW, WHAT ABOUT THAT OLD SILVERBACK, NEWT GINGRICH. BY THE WAY, THAT'S NOT A WILDLIFE METAPHOR. HE STOPPED SHAVING HIS BACK WHEN HE LEFT CONGRESS.
NEWT GINGRICH, WHAT DID HE HAVE $2.1 MILLION? THAT'S MORE THAN I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE.
THERE SHOULD BE ANS ASTERISK NEXT TO THAT BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY $1 MILLION IN DEBT.
Jon: OKAY, THERE COULD BE A LITTLE ASTERISK THERE OR YOU COULD CHANGE THE MOTHER TO MINUS  ONE MILLION. EITHER WAY IT'S A TIP GRAPHICAL ISSUE. IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT GINGRICH, UNLESS HE WAS OUT THERE TEN WEEKS AGO TOUTING HIS FISCAL BONA FIDE.
I AM DEBT-FREE. IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS AS DEBT-FREE AS I AM, EVERYBODY IN AMERICA WOULD BE CELEBRATING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ACTUALLY, PER CAPITA, WE OWE $45,000 PER PERSON, SO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS, IN FACT, IN A LOT LESS DEBT THAN YOU ARE. [LAUGHTER] SANTORUM IS A WOUNDED WILDEBEAST, AND GINGRICH IS APPARENTLY A SPAWNING SALMON. ALL RIGHT. NOW WE'RE GETTING THERE. LET'S SEE WHERE GOVERNOR TIM PAWLENTY IS AT. HE'S GOT THERE 4.4 MILLION RAISED.
FORMER GOVERNOR TIM PAWLENTY KICKED OFF THREE WEEKS OF IOWA  BODILY HARM STORMING IN ADVANCE OF THE STRAW POLL NEXT MONTH WITH AN R.V. STORM AND A WARNING  THAT IOWANS SHOULD NOT RAISE THEIR SUPPORT ON CHARISMATIC CANDIDATES WHO CAN'T ACTUALLY WIN.
Jon: OH, TIM PAWLENTY TAKING A BOLD STAND AGAINST KRIS MATT. [LAUGHTER] IT'S GOT NO PLACE IN POLITICS. HEY, LOOK, THIS IS NOT A POPULARITY CONTEST. OH, IT IS? OH. WELL, I WONDER HOW "THE DAILY SHOW" WILL DEPICT PAWLENTY'S DEMISE. [LAUGHTER] IF A PAWLENTY CAMPAIGN FALLS IN THE WOODS, DOES IT MAKE A SOUND? WHO'S NEXT.
HERMAN CAIN RAISED $2.5 MILLION.
Jon: $2.5 MILLION FOR HERMAN CAIN. THAT'S A LOT OF PEPPERONI FOR THE GODFATHER OF PIZZA. WHY IS CAIN CONNECTING?
I THINK I'M CONNECTING BECAUSE OF MY PASSION ABOUT MY SUPPORT AND BELIEF IN THE CONSTITUTION.
Jon: YES. HERMAN CAIN HAS PASSION. SUPPORT AND BELIEF IN THE CONSTITUTION.ï¿½r BUT DOES HERMAN CAIN HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSTITUTION?
YOU SAID THIS WEEK THAT YOU OPPOSE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MOSQUE IN MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE. WHAT'S YOUR OBJECTION TO THEIR BUILDING A NEW MOSQUE?
OUR CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. ISLAM COMBINES CHURCH AND STATE. THEY ARE USING THE CHURCH PART OF OUR FIRM TO INFUSE THEIR MOSQUE IN THAT COMMUNITY, AND  THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY DO NOT LIKE IT. THEY DISAGREE WITH IT.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. FIRST LET'S ADDRESS... [LAUGHTER] WHAT I BELIEVE MAY BE SOME PRONOUN ISSUES. [LAUGHTER] USING "OUR" FIRST AMENDMENT TO BUILD "" MOSQUE. IN REALITY,  THE  FIRST AMENDMENT  PROTECTS "THEIR" MOSQUE FROM "US."
SO YOU'RE SAYING ANY COMMUNITY, IF THEY WANT TO BAN A MOSQUE...
YES, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT. THAT'S NOT DISCRIMINATING BASED UPON RELIGION AGAINST THEIR PARTICULAR RELIGION. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF DISCRIMINATING  BASED UPON RELIGION. LET ME SEE IF I CAN ILLUSTRATE THAT BY REPLACING THE WORD MOSQUE IN THAT SENTENCE IN THE, YES, THEY CAN BAN THE MOSQUE SENTENCE, WITH THE WORD CHURCH. OR SYNAGOGUE OR CHURCH-SYNAGOGUE OR SCIENTOLOGY CELEBRITY CENTER. UNLESS YOU'RE SUGGESTING ISLAM IS OTHER THAN AN RELIGION.
ISLAM IS BOTH A RELIGION AND A SET OF LAWS, SHARIA LAW. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY ONE OF OUR OTHER TRADITIONAL  RELIGIONS WHENWHERE IT'S JUST ABOUT RELIGIOUS PURPOSES.
Jon: YES, YES, YES. [LAUGHTER] IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. I READ ABOUT THE STRANGENESS OF THEIR COMBINATION OF RELIGION AND LAWS IN MY PEOPLE'S HOLY  BOOK, THE TORAH, WHICH TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH LITERALLY MEANS "THE LAW."  I DON'T THINK THE PREDATORS ARE EVEN GOING TO BOTHER WITH THIS ONE. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S ADORABLE. OF COURSE, THERE'S ONE CANDIDATE WHO SEEMS TO BE GAINING STRENGTH  BY THE DAY, MICHELE BACHMANN, BUT CAN HER $4.2 MILLION FUND-RAISING HELP FED OFF QUESTIONS ABOUT HERRELLTIVE LACK  OF EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE, AND THIS THING.
FORMER AIDES SAY THE CONGRESSWOMAN IS PRONE TO "DEBILITATING MIGRAINES."
WILL MICHELE BACHMANN'S MIGRAINES HURT HER BID?
SHOULD THIS BE CONSIDERED A CAMPAIGN ISSUE?
Jon:, GOT TO SAY, OF ALL MY ISSUES WITH MICHELE BACHMANN'S BRAIN... [LAUGHTER] MIGRAINE'S NOT EVEN TOP 20. BUT WHO ARE WE KIDDING? WE KNOW WHO THE CLEAR FRONT-RUNNER IS. $18 MILLION RAISED, MITT ROMNEY IS THE KING OF THE JUNGLE. HE'S THE SUPER PREDATOR OF THE RACE. HE'S THE REPUBLICAN'S LEADER. BACK-UP WEEKEND GRETCHEN THINKS THERE MAY BE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROMNEY.
I THINK HE COULD GET A LOT OF MONEY FROM THAT.
BIG TIME.
ROMNEY OBVIOUSLY NOT BEING A CHRISTIAN.
Jon: WHAT? SOMEONE GET THAT WOMAN TO BOOK A MORMON. REALLY, ? CAN'T GET IN UNTIL FEBRUARY 2014? WOW, THAT THING IS DOING WELL. WELL, I'M SURE BACK-UP WEEKEND GRETCHEN'S PRODUCERS WILL POINT  OUT THE FALLACY OF HER REASONING DURING THE NEXT COMMERCIAL BREAK.
DURING THE 6:00 A.M. I MENTIONED THAT MITT ROMNEY WAS NOT A CHRISTIAN. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS CHURCH, AND THAT CHURCH DOES  CONSIDER ITS MEMBERS CHRISTIANS.
Jon: OH, AND ONE OTHER THING, TIME FOR LUTHERANS TO  [BLEEPED] OR GET OFF THE POT. REFORMATION IS OVER. YOU'RE IN OR YOU'RE OUT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
