Jon: WELCOME BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT ALL ENDED SO SUDDENLY. AS YOU RECALL, IT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CRUISED TO A MASSIVE MID  TERM ELECTION VICTORY. ONCE AND FOR ALL TAKING AMERICA BACK FROM THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAD THEMSELVES TAKEN IT BACK TWO  JUST YEARS EARLIER. CONSERVATIVES IN THE HIZZIE AND TO A LESSER QUITE FILIBUSTER-Y  EXTENT THEOnYESTERDAY'S OFF YEAR ELECTIO WAS THE FIRST CHANCE FOR VOTERS  TO SEW THEIR APPROVAL FOR THE NEW REPUBLICAN AGENDA. WE'LL CHECK IN.
OHIO VOTER BUSINESS A NEARLY 2-1 MARGIN REPEALED A NEW LAW RESTRICTING THE COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING RIGHTS OF STATE AND LOCAL UNIONS.
IT'S A HUGE DEFEAT FOR THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND HUGE VICTORY FOR ORGANIZED LABOR.
Jon: WOW, A HUGE VICTORY FOR ORGANIZED LABOR. THIS IS WHAT IT'S COME TO THEM FOR, A HUGE VICTORY MEANS UNIONS ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO EXIST. THIS IS THE BIGGEST NIGHT SINCE 1992'S WE DON'T HAVE TO USE A  SICK DAY TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS VICTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, LAST NIGHT'S LOSS SO HUMILIATING FOR OHIO GOVERNOR THAT FOX NEWS DECLARED HIM A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY -- THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS. NO, NO NEW YORK, NO. NOT A GOVERNOR, NOT A FRIEND, A DEMOCRAT. GO HOME AND GET YOUR (bleep) ON. ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON TO MISSISSIPPI A STATE SO RED EVEN THE ART HOUSE MOVIE  THEY'RE AT THES PLAY LARRY THE CABLE GUY SPECIALS. YESTERDAY MISSISSIPPI VOTERS WERE CONSIDERING A STATE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE  DEFINED EMBRYOS AS PEOPLE FROM THE MOMENT OF THEIR FERTILIZATION, SINGLE CELL  BLASTOLA WITH ALL RIGHTS.
PERSONHOOD INITIATIVE WOULD HAVE DECLARED LIFE BEGIN AS THE CONCEPTION.
Jon: WOW APPARENTLY THEY OPPOSE ABORTION WITHOUT BELIEVING THAT A WOMAN WHO USES  AN IUD IS A SERIAL KILLER. SCREENPLAY IDEA. IUD'S TURN NORMAL WOMEN INTO MASS MURDERERS. THE KILLER INSIDE ME? NO, NO. FETAL DESTINATION? NO NO. THE UNBORN ULTIMATE MATUM. WAIT, WAIT. TOMB RAIDER -- WE'LL RIGHT -- HOW ABOUT --  [ LAUGHTER ] HOW BAD IS IT WHEN THE CAMERA MAN GOES (bleep) THIS I'M OUT OF HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SORRY FRANCO. ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT ARIZONA? GROUND ZERO FOR A NATIONAL WAVE OF HARSH NEW ANTIIMMIGRATION LAWS. A STATE SO RED IT THINKS IT'S OWN NAME IS A LITTLE TOO MEXICAN. WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
ARIZONA VOTERS RECALLED THE REPUBLICAN STATE SENATOR RUSSELL PIERCE. HE SPONSORED THE STATE'S STRICT IMMIGRATION LAW REQUIRING POLICE  TO CHECK THE IMMIGRATION STATUS OF ANYONE THEY STOPPED.
IRONICALLY PIERCE WAS BEATEN SO BADLY IN THIS ELECTION THAT HE CRACKED OPEN AND CANDY  SPILLED OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL IN ALL --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH, YEAH. NOW YOU LOVE ME AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL IN ALL A TOUGH NIGHT FOR THE CONSERVATIVE REVOLUTION. THERE MUST BE A SIMPLE EXPLAINATION. TO THE NARRATIVE MACHINE.
DID REPUBLICANS OVERREACH?
REACH TOO FAR BY THE G.O.P.
IT WAS ABOUT OVERREACHING.
Jon: ARE YOU AWARE OF THEIR PLATFORM.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AIM ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUT THEM ON THE BAD GUY. ILLEGAL IS NOT A RACE. IT'S A CRIME.
WE BELIEVE THAT LIFE BEGIN AS THE CONCEPTION AND AT THE MOMENT  OF CONCEPTION EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS ENTITLED TO THE FREEDOMS UNDER THE DECORATION OF  INDEPENDENCE AND THE 14th AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
I DON'T FAVOR THE RIGHT TO STRIKE OF ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEE. THEY'VE GOT GOOD JOBS, HIGH PAY, GREAT RETIREMENT. WHAT ARE THEY THEY  STRIKING FOR.
Jon: THE PROBLEM THEY DIDN'T TRY TO OVERREACH. THEY TRIED TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO. IT WOULD BE LIKE DRINKING RED
