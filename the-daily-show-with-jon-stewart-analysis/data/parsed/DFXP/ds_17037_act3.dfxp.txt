Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER N.B.A. ALL STAR, NOW AN ANALYST FOR T.N.T.'S INSIDE THE N.B.A. AND THE FACE OF THE NEW WHAT IT WATCHERS FOR  MEN CAMPAIGN, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM CHARLES BARKLEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) VERY, VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MY FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M DOING WONDERFUL, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: STOP IT. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE? YOU'RE A MAN OF STYLE AND DISTINCTION. WHEN YOU LOSE THIS WEIGHT, YOUR TAILOR, IS HE ON CALL? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TERMS OF... THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SUIT BUT IT IS VOLUMINOUS. YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO READJUST IT TO THE MORE VELDT AND APPEALING CHARLES BARKLEY.
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY. BUT I'LL GET... LIKE, I HAVE TWO WARDROBE, A SKINNY WARDROBE AND A FAT WARDROBE. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS PART OF MY SKINNY WARDROBE. BUT I'M GOING TO LOSE SOME MORE WEIGHT SO I'VE GOT TO GET ANOTHER WARDROBE MADE WHEN I  KEEP LOSING WEIGHT.
Jon: GIVE ME THAT AND I COULD MAKE FIVE SUITS FOR MYSELF OUT OF THAT. (LAUGHTER)
I TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS A PROBLEM, THOUGH, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW NONE OF MY CLOTHES ARE  FITTING BUT IT'S STUPID OF ME TO GET NEW STUFF MADE UNTIL I GET  WHERE I'M GOING TO GET AT SOME POINT.
Jon: TWO WORDS, I'M GOING TO SAY THIS ADVICE FROM ME TO YOU: MALE SPANX. (LAUGHTER)
NO, NO, NO. NO.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT MANLY. NOT AS... AS A PRO-ATHLETE YOU FEEL LIKE...
IT'S NOT MANLY, NO, IT'S NOT.
Jon: I'M NOT... I DON'T WEAR THEM. (LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO RECOMMEND THEM TO ME?
Jon: I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME A WHILE.
I'M EXCITING THE BASKETBALL IS BACK.
I AM, TOO, I WAS GETTING BORED DOING NOTHING.
HOW LONG... WHEN YOU RETIRE AND YOU RETIRE AND YOU THINK TO  YOURSELF I'M GOING TO PLAY GOLF, I'M GOING TO ENJOY MYSELF, HOW LONG DOES THAT ENJOYMENT LAST  BEFORE YOU THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS CLUB AND KILL SOMEBODY?
THREE MONTHS.
Jon: THREE MONTHS?
THREE MONTHS. BECAUSE GUYS ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE ME ADVICE WHEN I'M GETTING READY TO RETIRE. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING TO DO. I SAID THE FIRST MONTH IS GREAT, THE SECOND MONTH IS PRETTY GOOD. THE THIRD MONTH YOU'RE LIKE IT'S CAR POOLING AND SITTING AROUND  ALL DAY IS DOING NOTHING FOR ME. IT'S LIKE THREE MONTHS AND YOU GO CRAZY.
Jon: SO NOW YOU'RE BACK TO WORK AND MUCH HAPPIER. SHAQ IS YOUR PARTNER.
YEAH, WE HIRED SHAQ AND HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB. WE HAVE A LOT... YOU'VE MET SHAQ BEFORE? IS.
Jon: HAVE I MEAT SHAQ? HE AND I SHARE SUITS. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, SHAQ IS THE BIGGEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.
Jon: GIGANTIC.
HE'S GIGANTIC BUT WE LOVE HAVING HIM.
Jon: HE'S FUNNY.
REALLY FUNNY. NICE GUY, TOO.
Jon: IN 1999, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, YOU THREW A BASKETBALL AT SHAQ'S HEAD.
YES.
Jon: WHAT IS THE... (LAUGHTER). IF I MAY... AND NOT, LIKE, OH, HAY, I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A GAME. YOU WERE MAD. WHAT IS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR TWO GIGANTIC MEN THROWING A BALL AT EACH OTHER'S HEAD. LIKE, IN THE... DO YOU HAVE A-TO-DISCUSS THAT BEFORE YOU SIT TOGETHER? HAD YOU DISCUSSED IT PRIOR LIKE, HEY, MAN, SORRY I ALMOST KILLED YOU WITH THAT BALL?
IT WAS OVER THAT NIGHT. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER... LIKE SOMETIMES THINGS DO HAPPEN IN THE GAME. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER ONCE THE GAME IS OVER IT'S SQUASHED.
Jon: THE BEEP IS GONE.
THE BEEP IS GONE. SOMETIMES IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THINGS DO HAPPEN. BUT I THINK ONCE THE GAME IS OVER, THE BEEP IS OVER.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT I LIKE. IN HOCKEY THEY HAVE A TRADITION-- AND IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST VIOLENT SPORTS THAT  THEY FIGHT EACH OTHER FOR TWO MINUTES BUT AT THE END OF THE GAME THEY DO THAT LITTLE SKATE  AND THEY ALL SHAKE EACH OTHER'S...
Jon: WEOTHER'S...
WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE BROTHERS AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SKATE. (LAUGHTER) SO WE DON'T DO THAT. (LAUGHTER)
I WASN'T... JUST TO CLARIFY THE IDEA IN SOME RESPECTS, I WAS  NOT SUGGESTING THAT AFTER A BASKETBALL GAME... (LAUGHTER). ... YOU THEN TAKE THE BASKETBALL COURT UP, REPLACE IT WITH ICE. EVERYBODY WAITS AROUND FOR HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKES AND THEN YOU SKATE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU  BEING HONEST ABOUT YOUR LIMITATIONS. I'M A JEW, I CAN'T DUNK. SO WE ALL HAVE... WE ALL HAVE OUR LIMITATIONS.
WELL... I PLAYED WITH DANNY SHEAS.
Jon: DANNY SHEAS COULDN'T DUNK. DO YOU BELIEVE DANNY CHAISE COULD DUNK? THAT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION. HE COULD LIFT HIS ARM UP AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE WAS DUNKING BUT IF YOU LOOKED, NO GAP  BETWEEN HIS SHOES AND THE FLOOR. (LAUGHTER) IT'S VERY SAD. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE BEST TEAM THIS YEAR? WHO ARE YOU LIKING?
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I'M NOT... THE TWO BEST TEAMS RIGHT NOW TO ME ARE CHICAGO AND MIAMI. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: SO IN YOUR MIND, THE NICKS. YOU FEEL LIKE THE NICKS? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I REALLY THINK IT'S SOMETHING IN THE WATER IN NEW YORK. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK HAVE SUCH AN INFLATED EGO WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR TEAM. (BOOS).
Jon: IT'S NOT EGO. IT'S NOT EGO. HE CAN SERIOUSLY KICK ALL YOUR ASSES. IT'S NOT EGO. IT'S DESPERATION. WE HAVE NOT WON A BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE COLLIDE FRAZIER AND EARL MONROE AND WE  CAME SO CLOSE AGAINST THE ROCKETS. REMEMBER THE GAME WHEN JOHN STARKS SHOT 1 FOR 88.
Jon: .
ANOTHER YEAR AIN'T GONNA HURT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN IT THIS YEAR.
Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION MIGHT BREAK THAT NEWS MAYBE MORE GENTLY. (LAUGHTER) MIGHT SAY THAT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPASSION LIKE, HEY, MAN, I CARE ABOUT YOU BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU MAY HAVE TO STEEL YOURSELF WITH SOME RESOLVE.
YOU KNOW, I GOT LOVE FOR YOU AND I... THE NICKS ARE ALL RIGHT  BUT THEY'RE NOT GONNA WIN ANYTHING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NICE TRY. ALL RIGHT, WELL YOU STILL LOOK NICE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jon: CHARLES, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY. WILL YOU COME BY AGAIN AND SEE US SOON?
ANY TIME.
Jon: THANK YOU, MY FRIEND, CHARLES BARKLEY, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND
