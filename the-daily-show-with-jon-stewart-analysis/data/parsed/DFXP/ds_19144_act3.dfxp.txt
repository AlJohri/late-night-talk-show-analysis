[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE REGIONAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE TALIBAN REVIVAL: VIOLENCE AND EXTREMISM ON THE PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN FRONTIER. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM HASSAN ABBAS. HELLO, SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE TALIBAN REVIVAL." I THINK IT MUST HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN PRINTED IN ERROR BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE WE TOOK CARE OF THESE GUYS. I'M PRETTY SURE WE WENT TO AFGHANISTAN. SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY DONE NOW. THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONE.
WE THOUGHT SO. THAT WAS WHAT WE THOUGHT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED...
Jon: YES.
BUT THAT'S NOT THE STORY. WE THOUGHT THAT AFTER THE 9/11 TRAGEDY AND THE WAY THE U.S. FORCES WENT IN THAT WE WOULD GO AND JUST THROUGH BOMBING AND JUST THROUGH MILITARY KINETIC ACTION, WHICH WAS IMPORTANT, BUT THERE WAS MORE SPACE THAT THEY HAD GAINED. THEY HAD MORE POWER, AND THEY HAD MORE IDEAS THAT WE NEVER THOUGHT WOULD BE THERE.
Jon: BUT WE ALSO... YOU KNOW, WE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME IN A SORT OF HEARTS AND MINDS, NATION-BUILDING MODE, AS WELL. I MEAN, IN AFGHANISTAN, IN IRAQ, TEN YEARS, 12 YEARS, 14 YEARS, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. HAS THAT BEEN FOR NAUGHT?
NO. THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION, BUT IN SOME CASES WE THOUGHT WE'D BE ABLE TO AT TIMES MICROMANAGE. WE ALSO THOUGHT, AND WHEN I SAY "WE," THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WE THOUGHT THAT WE COULD JUST INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM AND LIBERTY AND THE OTHERS WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE IT. THEY WERE GOING THROUGH A TERRIBLE PHASE OF WAR FOR TWO OR THREE DECADES. AND WE WENT ONLY FOR ENHANCING THEIR CAPABILITY TO FIGHT TERRORISM THROUGH KINETIC MEANS. FOR INSTANCE, IT WAS A LATE THOUGHT, IT WAS QUITE LATE IN THE GAME THAT WE THOUGHT THAT AFGHANISTAN NEEDS POLICE AS WELL, THE CIVILIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT INFRASTRUCTURES, BECAUSE CIVILIAN POLICING IS LINKED TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS LINKED TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW IS LINKED TO DEMOCRACY. THERE'S NO SHORT WAY OR SHORTCUT TO THIS. SO WE WANTED TO DO WELL. I TEACH U.S. OFFICERS WHO HAVE SERVED IN THAT AREA. I SALUTE THEM, THEIR DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT. BUT IN TERMS OF POLICY, WE NEEDED A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE, WELL-THOUGHT-OUT PROCESS ABOUT EDUCATION, ABOUT AWARENESS. SO WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE COULD, BUT TO REALLY TACKLE THIS KIND OF EXTREMISM THAT WE ARE SEEING IN AFGHANISTAN STILL AND IN IRAQ IN THE SHAPE OF ISIS, THAT REQUIRES A VERY, I THINK, A MORE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY, INTERNALLY AS WELL AS EXTERNALLY.
Jon: BUT IT DOESN'T, YOU KNOW, BY ALL INDICATIONS, THESE GROUPS, THE TALIBAN, FOR WHATEVER THEIR POWER IS, FOR WHATEVER THEIR REVIVAL, ISIS, THE TALIBAN, THEY DON'T SEEM TO ENJOY HUGE POPULAR SUPPORT AMONGST THE PEOPLE. THEY SEEM TO RULE THROUGH FEAR AND THROUGH VICIOUSNESS AND DEPRAVITY. I THINK THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THERE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO LEAD THEIR LIVES. IT DOESN'T APPEAR SO. HOW DO YOU FOCUS ON THAT?
THAT IS TRUE. AND THEY HAVE DEVISED GOOD WAYS TO MANAGE THIS. FOR INSTANCE, THE VERY IDEA OF AL QAEDA, IT WAS NOT ABOUT FOOT SOLDIERS AND A POLITICAL PARTY.
Jon: RIGHT.
THIS WAS A FEW PEOPLE HAD SOME IDEAS BASED ON DISTORTION OF ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES. BUT THEN THEY KNEW HOW TO CREATE FEAR. THE WHOLE POLICY, THE WHOLE VIEW AND THEORY ABOUT TERROR TACTICS, THAT IS TO OPPRESS, THAT IS TO CONTROL, MANIPULATE, BLACKMAIL. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD AT, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO SEEM IN MY WAY, AS I WOULD SAY WEARING MY HAT, MY RELIGIOUS IDENTITY, TO SEE THE KIND OF... TO SEE CHALLENGE TO THIS FROM WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS HAPPENED. AT TIMES WE FORGET ABOUT IT. AT TIMES WE IGNORE IT. AT TIMES IT DOESN'T FIT INTO OUR MODEL. BUT THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE DEGENERATION OF RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL HEART, IF I MAY CALL IT THAT, HAS ALSO BEEN VERY SEVERE. THIS SCOURGE OF SECTARIANISM, THIS KIND OF BIGOTRY AND RELIGIOUS ZEAL, THAT THEN ENABLES THESE THUGS
Jon: RIGHT.
WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUNDS TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. I'M SAYING THAT FOR ANY SUSTAINABLE CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO FOR INSTNACE PICK PARTNERS FROM THE OUTSIDE IN IRAQ OR IN AFGHANISTAN, PICK PARTNERS WHO NOT WOULD LOOK AT THEM AS IDENTICAL OF OURS AND MIDDLE. WE NEED PARTNERS WHO HAVE CREDIBILITY...
Jon: RIGHT.
WHO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF RESPECT, AND THEY CHALLENGE THEM.
Jon: BUT, THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT THAT YOU BRING UP, AND IT'S THE ONE THAT I CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND: WHY IS IT THE UNITED STATES? WHY CAN'T SAUDI, UAE, ALL OF THESE GROUPS THAT HAVE MORE CREDIBILITY IN THAT REGION AND CERTAINLY IN THE SUNNI WORLD, WHY CAN'T THEY TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS TYPE OF THING AND DO WHAT YOU SAY? MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT AUTHORITARIANISM IS AS BAD AS TERRORISM. IN SOME OF THESE CASES, I'LL NOT NAME ANY COUNTRIES, BUT THE KIND OF BIGOTRY THAT WE SEE HAS BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED IN SOME OF THESE CASES. FOR US FROM OUTSIDE, WE MUST SEE THE KIND OF INJUSTICES, OPPRESSION SOME OF THE MINORITIES WITHIN THE MUSLIM AND NON-MUSLIMS WHO ARE FACING ALL THESE CHALLENGES.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT THEY REQUIRE A DIFFERENT, DISPASSIONATE LOOK. IT HAS TO BE MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE, AND I'M USING THE WORD "COMPREHENSIVE" AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT HAPPENING.
Jon: BUT THEN IT'S A WORLD JOB. IF THIS IS A REGION TRAPPED BETWEEN AUTOCRACY AND EXTREMISM, THEN IT'S THE JOB, I JUST THINK IT'S TOO BIG A JOB FOR ONE COUNTRY. CAN YOU STICK AROUND? WE'LL GO TO COMERCIAL. YOU'LL STICK AROUND AND YOU'LL TELL US HOW TO DO IT.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ENDING OF THE BOOK, BUT DO WE WIN?
WE WILL. WE WILL.
Jon: "THE TALIBAN REVIVAL" IS ON THE BOOKS SHELVES NOW. HASSAN ABBAS, THANK YOU.
