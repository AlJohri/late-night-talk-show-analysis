FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEAD QUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon:  WELCOME. TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A ONE WILLIAM O'REILLY. WILL BE JOINING US FOR ONE OF OUR PATENTED WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE DO. BASICALLY IT WILL BE LIKE YOU AT HOME AT THANKSGIVING WITH TWO UNCLES YOU REALLY WISH DIDN'T SHOW UP. BUT FIRST, WITH LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY, AMERICA, THAT'S US. HAS RESIGNED ITSELF TO GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF ANOTHER MIDTERM CAMPAIGN. AND FOREMOST AMONG THOSE MOTIONS, DEBATES. A CHANCE FOR CANDIDATES TO PRESENT AND DEFEND THEIR IDEAS THROUGH REASONED ARTICULATE DISCOURSE. I'M JUST KIDDING.
CANDIDATES LOOKING FOR A COMEBACK ARE HOPING THEIR OPPONENTS HAVE AN OOPS MOMENT ON STAGE TO TRY AND SHIT MOMENTUM.
Jon: YOU CAN FORM A COGENT ARGUMENT. [LAUGHTER] OR YOU CAN STAND THERE QUIETLY AND WAIT FOR YOUR OPPONENT'S [BLEEP] TO SLIP OUT OF HIS PANTS. [LAUGHTER] AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF NOT FOR SOME POORLY CONSTRUCTED PANTALOONS SLAVERY MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED.  POINT LINCOLN. [LAUGHTER] THE DEBATES ARE THE SUBJECT OF DEMOCALYPSE 2014: JUST TRY NOT TO SAY SOMETHING STUPID FOR 90 MINUTES. [BLEEP] SLIPS ASIDE, WHAT'S BEEN INTERESTING ABOUT THESE MIDTERM DEBATES WAS THAT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE FINALLY FINDING SOME COMMON GROUND.
I DO NOT AGREE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ON HIS ENERGY POLICIES.
I HAVE MY DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE PRESIDENT.
WHEN YOU VOTE WITH THE PRESIDENT 96% OF THE TIME, YOU REPRESENT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICYIES.
I DISAGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT.
MARK PRYOR IS A RUBBER STAMP FOR BARACK OBAMA
I STOOD YOU REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.
OBAMA'S GONNA GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE WORST PRESIDENTS.
Jon: YOU SEE. ALL THIS COUNTRY REALLY NEEDED TO COME TOGETHER IS A COMMON ENEMY WHETHER IT BE THE GERMANS OR THE SOVIETS OR THE MAN WE OVERWHELMINGLY REELECTED TO LEAD US 23 MONTHS AGO. [LAUGHTER] IN FACT ... [LAUGHTER] MANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE SOUGHT TO SHOW THAT THEIR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS WERE IN FACT LOVING OBAMA. IN FACT, MARRIED TO OBAMA, AND IS THE MODERN STYLE HAD TAKEN HIS NAME AS A HYPHENATE.
OBAMA-WARNER POLICIES.
THE OBAMA-PRYOR ECONOMY.
THIS OBAMA-AIKEN ECONOMY.
Jon:  YES, YES. THE OBAMA-AIKEN ECONOMY. THE OBAMA-AMERICAN IDOL RUNNER UP TURNED NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE CLAY AIKEN ECONOMY, WHICH HAS BEEN STRUGGLING DUE TO STAGNANT WAGES, LOSS OF MANUFACTURING BASE AND BEING A LITTLE PITCHY, DOLL. A LITTLE PITCHY. OF COURSE NOT ALL DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING FROM OBAMA DUE TO HIS UNPOPULAR POLICY. DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE FROM KENTUCKY ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES IS RUNNING FROM OBAMA ON PRINCIPLE.
WHY ARE YOU RELUCTANT TO GIVE AN ANSWER ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU VOTED FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
BILL, THERE'S NO RULUCTANCY. THIS IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. OUR CONSTITUTION GRANTS HERE IN KENTUCKY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR PRIVACY AT THE BALLOT BOX.
Jon:  MY COUNTRY TIS OF THEE. NO, YOU CANNOT SEE. [LAUGHTER] I SEE, VOTING IS A RIGHT TO PRIVACY ISSUE. EXPLAINS WHY THEY GIVE YOU THOSE STICKERS WHEN YOU -- [LAUGHTER] AND GRIMES' PRINCIPLED STAND, GRIMES' PRINCIPLED STAND WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY UNDERMINED BY HER ANNOUNCING LAST MONTH THAT IN THE 2008 PRIMARY SHE VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON. BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT, HILLARY IS POPULAR. IT'S ALL IN THE CONSTITUTION. LOOK DEMOCRATS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES RUNNING FROM THEIR PARTY. REPUBLICANS ARE RETREATING ON THE CULTURE WARS.
THE FACT IS I SUPPORT OVER THE COUNTER CONTRACEPTION.
TEN YEARS AGO YOU SUPPORTED A FEDERAL  CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON MARRIAGE. DO YOU STILL SUPPORT THAT?
IT WAS THE -- WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
RIGHT.
IT WAS THE PLATFORM CALLED FOR A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT AND AS CHAIRMAN OF THE RNC, I STOOD FOR THE PLATFORM. BUT AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR, I'M TALKING NOW ABOUT MY POLICIES.
Jon:  MY POLICIES. NOT THE ONES I WAS PAID TO PRETEND I SUPPORTED OR THE ONES I WILL BE PAID TO SUPPORT AFTER I LOSE AND BECOME A LOBBYIST FOR ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. THE POINT IS GIVE ME MONEY AND I'LL DO WHAT YOU SAY. ED GILLESPIE, 2014 THE BIDDING STARTS NOW. LOOK, THIS ELECTION'S UNDERLYING THEME IS THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE SO UNPOPULAR THAT THEIR CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING ON HOW MUCH THEY HATE THEMSELVES. OF COURSE THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE HAVING SPENT THE LAST SIX YEARS BREAKING OUR GOVERNMENT. THEY NOW GET TO RUN ON THE ANGER RESULTING FROM SAID BROKEN GOVERNMENT. AND NOWHERE WAS THIS CYNICAL PLOY MORE EVIDENT THAN WITH SENATE MINORITY LEADER AND SHELL BEARING REPTILE MITCH MCCONNELL.
I WILL BE PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE DEMOCRATS WHEN WE CAN FIND AREAS OF AGREEMENT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: FOR INSTANCE, WE COULD START WITH NOBODY LIKES BEING STUNG BY BEES. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, DESPITE MCCONNELL'S SWEARING OF CONCILIARY INTENT THAT IS COMPLETE BULL [BLEEP]. COMING FROM THE MAN WHO PERSONALLY STOOP UP AT A REPUBLICAN RETREAT AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS RIGHT BEFORE OBAMA'S 2009 INAUGURATION AND SAID THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO BLOCK THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA AS LONG AS WE  MARCH IN LOCK STEP. AS LONG AS REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO FOLLOW OBAMA'S LEAD, AMERICANS WILL SEE PARTISAN FOOD FIGHTS AND CONCLUDE THAT OBAMA HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE CHANGE. LOOKS LIKE THE TORTOISE WINS AGAIN. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS STRATEGY IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ATTACK SOMETHING LIKE KENTUCKY'S KYNECT HEALTH CARE WEBSITE WHICH MCCONNELL CAN'T ADMIT WORKS SINCE IT'S GOT OBAMA STINK ON IT. BUT HE CAN'T SHUT IT DOWN BECAUSE IT WORKS. WATCH HOW HE MAGICALLY DOES IT.
THE WEBSITE CAN CONTINUE BUT IN MY VIEW THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY WOULD BE ACHIEVED BY PULLING OUT OBAMACARE ROOT AND BRANCH.
AND YOU WOULD SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF KYNECT?
WELL, IT'S A STATE DECISION. SEVERAL STATES HAD --
BUT WOULD YOU SUPPORT IT?
WELL IT'S FINE, YEAH. I THINK IT'S FINE TO HAVE A WEBSITE. YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  MITCH MCCONNELL, HE WILL KEEP THE WEBSITE BUT HE WILL GET RID OF THE PROGRAM THE WEBSITE CONNECTS YOU TO. [LAUGHTER] LEAVE THE WEBSITE IN SOME KIND OF INTERNET GHOST SO PEOPLE CAN SCROLL THROUGH HEALTH CARE OPTIONS THEY CAN NO LONGER CHOOSE FROM. OH LOOK, HONEY, HERE'S A PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE PAID FOR YOUR CHEMO TREATMENTS. OH, TOO BAD IT NO LONGER EXISTS. [LAUGHTER] SO IF DEMOCRATS CAN'T RUN ON ANYTHING THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST SIX YEARS, AND REPUBLICANS CAN'T RUN ON MAKING SURE NOTHING GOT DONE OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS. WHAT DOES ANYONE HAVE LEFT TO RUN ON?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'VE GOT AN EBOLA OUTBREAK,
THE GROWING THREAT OF ISIS.
ISIS SHOULD BE DESTROYED.
TAKE ISIS OUT.
KEEP AMERICA SAFE FROM TERRORISM.
SEAL THE BORDER AND SECURE IT.
PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FAMILIES FROM EBOLA.
MIDTERMS 2014. WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF SO WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH FEAR. AAAAHHHHHH.
