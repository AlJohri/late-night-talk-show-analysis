[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT A BEST SELLING AUTHOR WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED FLASH BOYS A WALL STREET REVOLT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL LEWIS. SIR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. WELCOME. FIRST OFF, LET ME JUST SAY THIS:  YOU WRITE PRETTY. THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD. IT -- FIRST OF ALL WE'LL BACKTRACK. THIS IS ABOUT THIS THING CALLED HFT, HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING. WHAT IS THAT?
VERY FAST COMPUTERIZED TRADING ON THE STOCK MARKET.
Jon: TO GET AN ADVANTAGE.
TO GET AN ADVANTAGE RIGHT. SO THERE ARE 13 PUBLIC STOCK EXCHANGES SELL THE RIGHT TO ADVANCE INFORMATION TO HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS AND THEY DO THIS BY SELLING THEM THE RIGHT TO LOCATE THEIR COMPUTERS. THEY'RE TRADING THE HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING COMPUTERS RIGHT NEXT TO THE STOCK EXCHANGE COMPUTER. SO THAT --
Jon: SO IT'S A QUESTION OF MILLISECONDS?
YES. I MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INFORMATION THAT A HIGH FREQUENCY TRADER SEES AND WHAT MOST INVESTORS SEE IS A COUPLE OF MILLISECONDS.
Jon: IT'S A COMPUTER.
IT'S ENOUGH FOR A COMPUTER. A COUPLE OF MILLISECONDS IS A LOT OF TIME FOR A COMPUTER. THERE'S ENOUGH TIME FOR THE COMPUTER TO REACT TO WHAT DO YOU.
Jon: SO THE COMPUTER FINDS OUT YOU PLACE AN ORDER FOR A STOCK.
YES.
Jon: THE COMPUTER JUMPS IN AND SAYS YOU ARE BUYING THAT STOCK. LET ME JUMP IN, BUY THAT STOCK, AND SELL IT RIGHT BACK TO YOU.
THAT WILL DO.
Jon: THAT IS WHAT THEY DO?
NO, BUT THAT WILL DO.
Jon: THEY INSERT THEMSELVES AS A MIDDLE MAN IN A TRANSACTION THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN.
IN MANY WAYS, YES. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEY ARE TRADING AS IF THEY KNOW THE PRICES BEFORE YOU DO. IF YOU COME IN TO BUY, THEY MAY KNOW THAT THEY CAN BUY IT CHEAPER BECAUSE THE PRICE HAS MOVED BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SO THEY BUY IT CHEAPER AND SELL IT TO YOU. IT'S TOTALLY UNNECESSARY WALL STREET INTERMEDIATIONS. THEY ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET WHERE THEY ARE NOT NEEDED.
Jon: THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED FRONT RUNNING THAT IS ILLEGAL. IF DO YOU IT WITH JUST INFORMATION. IF YOU FIND OUT INFORMATION ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT ALLOWS YOU AN ADVANTAGE TO BUY IT BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES THAT IS CALLED FRONT RUNNING AND IT'S ILLEGAL, YES?
BECAUSE IT'S A COMPUTER IT'S OKAY.
Jon: OH, BUT FRONT RUNNING AS A PERSON IS ILLEGAL. BUT AS A COMPUTER EH?
I THINK IT'S MORE GENERALLY A PROBLEM. PEOPLE DO THINGS WITH COMPUTERS THEY WOULD NEVER DO AS PEOPLE.
Jon: WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME WHEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT? SO THIS BOOK -- HERE IS WHAT IS GREAT. THIS BOOK ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE WORLD OF HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING. WHAT I DIDN'T EXPECT FROM THIS BOOK IS A KIND OF GROUP OF HEROS TO EMERGE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT GOT TOGETHER TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
IT'S -- IT'S SUCH A STRANGE STORY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS -- IT'S ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ON WALL STREET WHO FIGURE OUT, KIND OF AROUND 2008 THAT THE STOCK MARKET IS -- SOMETHING FUNNY IS HAPPENING. IT'S NOT JUST THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR SCREENS AND THE STOCK MARKET SAYS IT'S -- YOU CAN BUY 50,000 SHARES OF MICROSOFT AT $20 A SHARE. THEY GO TO BUY IT AND IT GOES AWAY AND THE STOCK PRICE GOES UP. IT'S AS IF THE MARKET KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO BEFORE THEY DO IT. ONE CHARACTER. IT'S A CANADIAN. A GUY NAMED BRAD KATSUYAMA WHO RUNS THE STOCK MARKET AT THE ROYAL BANK OF CANADA. BECAUSE HE IS CANADIAN HE HAS A SENSE OF DECENCY. [LAUGHTER] AND HE IS NOT LIKE SOME RADICAL.
Jon: HE IS A WALL STREET GUY.
HE IS NOT EVEN REALLY THAT MUCH OF A WALL STREET GUY. HE IS KIND OF A CANADIAN GUY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S ODD THAT HE IS IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE HE IS CONFORMIST EVEN BY CANADIAN STANDARDS. ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS BE LIKE DOING GOOD WORK AT HIS WALL STREET FIRM. BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MARKET LOOKS RIGGED AND HE STARTS TO ASK HOW IS IT RIGGED. THE STORY IS THE STORY OF HIM TURNING OVER ROCKS AND FINDING SOMETHING NEFARIOUS UNDER EVERY ROCK UNTIL HE ASSEMBLED A PICTURE OF THE STOCK MARKET WHICH NO ONE HAS REALLY ASSEMBLED. INSTEAD OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT TO MAKE MONEY OR THE ROYAL BANK OF CANADA OR HIMSELF, HE TELLS INVESTORS ABOUT IT. WHICH IS ALSO ANOTHER KINDA CANADIAN THING TO DO. THERE'S A CANADIAN DIMENSION TO THIS STORY THAT RUNS THROUGH IT, RIGHT.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE NAME DUDLEY DO RIGHT BUT IT'S HARD NOT TO SEE THE COMPARISONS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE DISADVANTAGE THE STORY HAS IS THE HERO IS CANADIAN BECAUSE EVERYBODY KINDA GOES CANADIAN. BUT THE
Jon: HE ASSEMBLES LIKE A RAG TAG TEAM. OCEANS 11 TYPE GUYS.
YES.
Jon: LET ME PITCH THE MOVIE FOR YOU.
IT'S BEEN DONE.
Jon: THEY GET TOGETHER AND THEY START THEIR OWN STOCK EXCHANGE THAT RUNS THINGS RIGHT.
THEY GO TO INVESTORS. PEOPLE RUNNING THE SAVINGS OF THIS COUNTRY AND SAY LOOK THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE INVESTORS -- YOU WOULD THINK THE INVESTORS WOULD KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE STOCK MARKET AND THEY KIND OF DO. THEY KIND OF KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG. THEY GO TO THE HEDGE FUND MANAGER BILL ACKMAN WHO IS ALWAYS BUYING COMPANIES AND SELLING COMPANIES. HE THOUGHT. HE THOUGHT THEY HAD A LEAK AN INSIDER TRADING LEAK. THE MARKET WAS SO ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT HE DID IN THE MARKET HE THOUGHT SOMEONE INSIDE HIS SHOP WAS LEAKING INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN HE WAS DOING.
Jon: WHICH WOULD BE ILLEGAL.
IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL.
Jon: BUT IF A COMPUTER DOES IT.
IT'S OKAY. ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A MAC. [LAUGHTER] BUT SO -- SO -- THIS HE GOES -- HE EDUCATES PEOPLE. THEY SAY TO HIM CREATE A FAIR PLACE FOR US TO TRADE. SO IN A WAY HE WAS ANSWERING A CALL.
Jon: AND THEY DO IT AND PEOPLE GO AFTER THEM IN INCREDIBLY VICIOUS WAYS, TRYING TO RUIN THEM AND BREAK THEM. AND THEY CREATE THIS IEX AND IT'S WORKING. IT'S STILL GOING ON THOUGH. YES. THE PROBLEM IS -- DO WE HAVE TIME HERE.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT WE'LL DO. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORKS AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AND WHY THEY ABDICATED AND WHY THEY ARE ATTACKING YOU LIKE CRAZY FOR JUST WRITING THIS STORY. WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK ABOUT. THAT WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE FROM MICHAEL LEWIS.
