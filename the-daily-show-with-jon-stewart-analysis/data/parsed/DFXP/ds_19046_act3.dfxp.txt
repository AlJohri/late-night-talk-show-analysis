[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HE IS THE COHOST OF PROJECT RUNWAY. HIS NEW SHOW IS LIFETIME'S UNDER THE GUNN.
LET ME EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK. EACH MENTOR IS GOING TO CHOOSE FOUR DESIGNERS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN UNDER THE GUNN IS A TEAM COMPETITION. YOU WILL EACH BE COMPETING AS INDIVIDUALS BUT IN A MENTORING GROUP. EVERY WEEK ONE DESIGNER WILL BE ELIMINATED BY THE JUDGES. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOU. AND THERE WILL BE AN ULTIMATE RUNWAY SHOWDOWN AMONG THE FINALISTS BUT THE DESIGNERS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES COMPETING. WHEN A MENTOR NO LONGER HAS ANY DESIGNERS ON THE COMPETITION, THE MENTOR IS ALSO ELIMINATED.
Jon: GUESS WHO IS DVRING THAT (bleep). YEAH. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW TIM GUNN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HI, EVERYONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? LOOKING SHARP AS ALWAYS.
I'M FANTASTIC. WHY DO I HAVE TO FOLLOW SAMANTHA BEE?
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? DID SHE LEAVE IT OUT ON THE FLOOR? THAT WAS LIKE PATTY LAPONE. SHE WAS --
PHENOMENAL.
Jon: THAT WAS BLANCHE DUBOIS LEVEL GESTICULATION. I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING.
REALLY.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU DOING?
I'M FANTASTIC, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: THEY FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THE GOLD THEY HAD WITH GUNN, GAVE YOU YOUR OWN SHOW, THIS UNDER THE GUNN.
NO, THEY WERE DESPERATE.
Jon: AH!
NO, THEY REALLY WERE. WE WERE LOOSELY SCHEDULED TO SHOOT A NEW SEASON OF PROJECT RUNWAY. HEIDI WAS ONLY MARGINALLY CONSULTED. HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT?
Jon: HEIDI KLUM. HEIDI KLUM.
AND HEIDI SAID I'M NOT AVAILABLE. AND HEIDI AND I HAVE A LITTLE PINKY PACT AND IT IS THAT IF EITHER ONE OF US CAN'T DO A SEASON OF THE SHOW, THE OTHER ONE'S NOT DOING IT. SO THEY CAME TO ME AND THEY SAID WE CAN FIND ANOTHER HOST, AND I SAID WELL YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER MENTOR, TOO.
Jon: YOU STOOD UP AND YOU SAID, YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO HEIDI.  TIM GUNN STANDS WITH HEIDI KLUM.
I DID. I DO STAND WITH HEIDI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] >>Jon: NICELY DONE SIR. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU BRING THIS UP. HEIDI KLUM AND I ALSO HAVE A PINKY PACT.
OH, YEAH?
Jon: IF I COULD JUST GET CLOSE ENOUGH. [LAUGHTER] LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
SHE LOVES YOU.
Jon: AND I'M VERY FOND OF HER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ALWAYS LOOK -- BEFORE YOU WERE ON TELEVISION DID YOU ALWAYS LOOK THIS PUT TOGETHER?
OH, YOU FLATTER ME.
Jon: COULD YOU GO OUTLOOKING LIKE A SCHLUB OR DO YOU FEEL PRESSURE NOW YOU CAN'T DO THAT?
I CAN'T DO IT.
Jon: YOU CAN'T?
I CAN'T.
Jon: THAT'S PRESSURE.
IT IS.
Jon: SUNDAY MORNING YOU WAKE UP IT'S RAINING OUT. BEEN A LONG NIGHT. YOU'VE BEEN DOING SOMETHING. YOU'RE OUT, YOU'RE TIRED. YOU WANT TO GO GET A PAPER AND A CUP OF COFFEE AND A BIALY WITH A SCHMEAR. >>AND I DO IT.
Jon: BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO PUT ON?
WELL, I MEAN I'M NOT A CRAZY PERSON. IN THIS WEATHER, I'LL WEAR A TURTLE NECK, AND A PAIR OF JEANS AND I'LL PUT A PEACOAT  ON.
Jon: SO YOU WILL LOOK AS GOOD AS I'VE EVER LOOKED.
YOU ARE ONE OF BEST DRESSED GUY ON TELEVISION, I SAY IT ALL THE TIME.
Jon: THEY HANG IT ON MY DOOR I HAVE NO-- YOU SHOULD SEE-- CAN I TELL YOU A TRICK THAT I DO HERE? ON MONDAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER TIME I DO THIS,  SO I HAVE LONG JOHNS AND I'LL WEAR LIKE A T-SHIRT OVER IT ON MONDAY. ON TUESDAY, I PUT THE T-SHIRT ON, I PUT THE LONG JOHNS OVER THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN I JUST KEEP DOING THAT BACK AND FORTH, THEN EVERYBODY THINKS, HEY THAT GUY REALLY CHANGES HIS SHIRTS. THAT'S REALLY TRUE THOUGH, SADLY. THIS SHOW NOW THOUGH, HAVE YOU FINISHED TAPING IT, ARE YOU DONE?
YEAH, WE FINISHED ABOUT THREE AND A HALF WEEKS AGO.
Jon: AND ANOTHER NEW YORK PRODUCTION?
NO.
Jon: WHERE?
WE DID THE WHOLE THING IN LOS ANGELES. THIS GOES BACK TO HEIDI. IN DEFERENCE TO HEIDI WHO LIVES IN L.A.
Jon: OH I THOUGHT SHE LIVED IN NEW YORK.
NO, SHE LIVES IN L.A. SO SHE COMES HERE FOR A SEASON OF PROJECT RUNWAY,  WE DO TWO SEASONS WE WERE GOING TO DO THAT IN L.A.
Jon: YOU WENT TO L.A.?
SO I WENT TO L.A.
Jon: ISN'T IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS OUT THERE BECAUSE YOU NEED THE ACCESS TO THOSE TREMENDOUS GARMENT SHOPS AND THOSE FABRIC STORES AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING.
WELL THE TRAFFIC IS A CHALLENGE, I WILL SAY. WE HAVE LOTS OF FIELD TRIPS AND WE GO BACK AND FORTH TO MOOD  FOR MOST OF OUR CHALLENGES. AND IT JUST TAKES TIME, SO  WE END UP EXTENDING THE WORK DAY WHICH MEANS THE DESIGNERS GET LESS SLEEP. SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY A GOOD THING.
Jon: HOW LONG A DAY DO YOU THINK SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE THERE? LIKE A DESIGNER, LET'S SAY THEY ARE ON THE SHOW 12 HOUR DAY, 14?
OH NO, IT'S MORE LIKE AN 18 HOUR DAY.
Jon: OH FOR GOD'S SAKE, REALLY?
IT IS. I WILL TELL YOU THIS THOUGH. I MEAN LET'S TALK ABOUT A CHALLENGE SETUP DAY. WE TRAVEL TO WHERE WE SET IT UP. THAT'S AN HOUR. AND THEN IT'S ALL THE LIGHTING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT'S AN HOUR. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WORK IS LIKE.
Jon: YES A LOT OF SITTING AROUND.
AND THEN WE PRESENT THE CHALLENGE AND THEY SKETCH. WE HAVE TO TRAVEL WE HAVE TO TRAVEL TO MOOD, AND WE SHOP AT MOOD, AND WE GET BACK TO THE WORK ROOM. BY THE TIME WE GET BACK THEY HAVE ABOUT TEN HOURS TO WORK.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT'S WHY GOD INVENTED ADDEROL. [LAUGHTER] ALRIGHT, WELL I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS MY FRIEND, I'M GONNA WATCH THIS. IT'S UNDER THE GUNN PREMIERES THURSDAY. >>THURSDAY AT 9. YOUR OWN SHOW.
LIFETIME. VERY EXCITED.
THANK YOU.
Jon: TIM GUNN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
