AUGUST 1, 2011, FROM COME DPI CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS -- FROM  COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. FROM THE NEW PLANET OF APES FILM, FREIDA PINTO WOULD BE JOINING US. I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD A NEW PLANET OF THE APES FILM. [LAUGHTER] BEFORE WE GET TO TONIGHT'S SHOW. I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE. I'M A LITTLE BLURRY TONIGHT. A LITTLE OUT OF IT. AS USUAL, LAST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THE SHOW I WENT TO BEN BEGANS FOR MY -- BENNIGANS FOR  MY END OF WEEK TEQUILA SUNRISE SMOOTHIE. I'M NOT SAYING ANYBODY SLIPPED ME A MICKEY BUT I WOKE UP IN KANDAHAR. I WANT TO EXPLAIN QUICKLY IT'S FURTHER AWAY THAN WHAT I THOUGHT. WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT LATER IN THE PROGRAM. FIRST, I DID ARRIVE HOME TODAY TO WONDROUS NEWS.
A DEAL HAS BEEN REACHED IN THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE.
Jon: OH, MY GOD IT'S A RAHM RAMADAN MIRACLE.
A DEBT LIMIT INCREASE OF $2.1 TRILLION. A BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE CREATED TO AGREE ON ANOTHER TRILLION AND A HALF IN FUTURE SPENDING.
Jon: NO, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] YEAH, NO -- THAT'S -- THEY MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN TO ADD AND WITH THE NEW BALANCED APPROACH TO  DEFICIT REDUCTION FORGED BY RATIONAL ADULTS THERE'S REVENUE INCREASES CLOSING THE GAP WHILE  PRESERVING GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS. CAN WE ROLL THE CLIP OF THAT, PLEASE? DO WE HAVE THE CLIP? THE SKUNK WITH ITS HEAD IN THE PEANUT BUTTER JAR? WELL, NO, IT'S NOT THE ONE I WANTED BUT I'LL GIVE IT A LOOK. I'LL SEE THAT. ♪ ♪  [  APPLAUSE  ] THAT IS IS A ADORABLE. THAT IS ADORABLE. NO,LY NOT LET YOU DISTRACT ME. ALL RIGHT. THERE MUST BE REVENUE INCREASES IN THIS COMPROMISE BECAUSE I WAS TOLD JUST HOW CRUCIAL THAT WAS  TO THIS NEGOTIATION BY -- I DON'T KNOW LET'S CALL HIM AN UNNAMED SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL.
WE CAN'T JUST CLOSE OUR DEFICIT WITH SPENDING CUTS ALONE  WHAT WE'VE SAID IS AS PART OF A BROADER PACKAGE WE SHOULD HAVE REVENUES.
REVENUES SHOULD COME FROM THE PEOPLE WHO CAN MOST AFFORD IT.
SERIOUS CUTS BALANCED BY NEW REVENUES.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE REVENUES, IT MEANS YOU ARE PUTTING MORE OF A BURDEN ON THE PEOPLE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.
THANK YOU. IT'S THAT KIND OF EMPHATIC STEADFAST COMMITMENT THAT WILL PROTECT THOSE WHO CAN LEAST  AFFORD IT? SORRY, REALLY? JUST ROLL THE CLIP (bleep).
THE PRESIDENT HAS FAILED TO INCLUDE REVENUES IN THE CASE.
NO TAX INCREASES, IF WILL YOU.
THERE NO NO TAX REVENUES IN THIS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT CLIP WOULD BE A LEMUR WITH ITS HEAD IN A TUB OF MAYONNAISE. BUT --  [LAUGHTER] THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT TO BE PRETTY UPSET ABOUT WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE.
I WANT TO THANK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT'S BEEN YOUR VOICES, YOUR LETTERS, YOUR E-MAILS, YOUR TWEETS, YOUR PHONECALLS THAT  HAVE COMPELLED WASHINGTON TO ACT IN THE FINAL DAYS.
Jon: LET ME JUST STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. YOU ARE NOT PINNING THIS TERD ON US! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LAST TIME I CHECKED THE BUCK -- IF IT'S THE BUCK -- THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU NOT THE TWITTER-VERSE. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT, I GUESS, COULD HAVE INCLUDED A DEBT CEILING RAISE IN PREVIOUS  LEGISLATION THAT REPUBLICANS WERE DESPERATE FOR LIKE WHEN THEY WANTED TO EXTEND THE BUSH  TAX CUTS BACK IN DECEMBER SO THAT THE REPUBLICANS WOULDN'T HAVE HAD SUCH A SIGNIFICANT  AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE OVER THE WHITE HOUSE GOING INTO THE DEFICIT REDUCTION NEGOTIATION. EVEN A JEDI MASTER STRATEGIST WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.
HOW DO THESE NEGOTIATIONS EFFECT TALKS WITH REPUBLICANS ABOUT RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT? IT WOULD SEEM THAT THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LEAVAGE -- LEVERAGE OVER THE WHITE HOUSE?
WHEN YOU SAY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LEVERAGE OVER THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
Jon: WELL DONE POTTER TEN POINTS FOR GRIFFENDORF. [LAUGHTER] GO AHEAD THERE. TELL HIM WHEN YOU MEAN FROM DECEMBER.
A SENSE THAT THEY'LL SAY ESSENTIALLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO  RAISE THE -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO AGREE TO IT UNLESS THE WHITE HOUSE IS ABLE TO OR WILLING TO  AGREE TO SIGNIFICANT SPENDING CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD, PROBABLY GOING DEEPER AND FURTHER THAN  WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO DO. WHAT LEVERAGE WOULD YOU HAVE --
HERE IS MY EXPECTATION. I'LL TAKE JOHN BOEHNER AT HIS WORD THAT NOBODY, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IS WILLING TO SEE  THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: FUNNY BECAUSE IT HAPPENED. [LAUGHTER] LET ME DO A QUICK IMPRESSION OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE AT THE MOMENT. FIND ME THAT BOW TIE BOY AND LET HIM TELL US WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. [LAUGHTER] IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS GOT HOSED. BUT I'LL BET THE REPUBLICANS ARE CREAMING IN THEIR JEANS. I'M SORRY TROUSERS.
OOH! [LAUGHTER] MMMMM, MMMMM. [LAUGHTER] SUBTLE. [LAUGHTER] TRILLIONS IN SPENDING CUTS, NO REVENUE INCREASES, GO AHEAD TEA PARTY CONGRESS PEOPLE PUT ON  YOUR HATS, PLAY YOUR FIFES AND DANCE, TEA PARTY LIKE IT'S 1799.
I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS.
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN WHAT WE NEED. THIS IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE.
CONGRESSWOMAN MICHELLE BACHMANN IS VOTING AGAINST IT.
I'M GOING TO VOTE AGAINST IT.
IT'S A YES VOTE?
I'M VOTING AGAINST IT.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep) TEA PARTYERS? WHAT THE FEE, FI, FO -- (bleep) YOU CONTROL LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF CONGRESS AND YOU  HAVE CONVINCED EVERYONE -- TAKE THE WIN. WHAT ARE YOU SO ANGRY ABOUT? YES, GOVERNMENT STILL EXISTS. WE STILL HAVE TRAFFIC LIGHTS. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE SORRY. NOT EVERYBODY DEFINES FREEDOM AS THE ABILITY TO NOT PAY TAXES. GOVERNMENT ISN'T PERFECT BUT SOME PEOPLE WISH IT WAS BETTER NOT GONE. THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN LIKE --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- YOU'RE IN A BANK -- IT'S A NEGOTIATION WHERE YOU GOT SOME HOSthAGES AND AFTER GETTING  EVERYTHING YOU WANTED YOU GO, ONE LAST DEMAND, I GET TO KILL THE HOSTAGES, RIGHT? THIS IS THE PART WHERE THEY COME AFTER YOU AND THEY GO, YOU WON THE DEBATE AND THEY SAY WHAT ARE  GOING TO DO NOW? WE'RE GOING TO DISN --
