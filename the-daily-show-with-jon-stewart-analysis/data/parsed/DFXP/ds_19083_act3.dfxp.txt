DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO MY BROTHER? HOW THEY SEWED HIS DIREWOLF'S HEAD TO HIS BODY AND MY MOTHER. THEY SAY THEY CUT HER THROAT TO THE BONE AND THREW HER BODY IN THE RIVER.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAMILY WAS A TERRIBLE CRIME. I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR BROTHER. HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD MAN, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HIM. YOUR MOTHER, ON THE OTHER HAND, I ADMIRED HER. SHE WANTED TO HAVE ME EXECUTED BUT I ADMIRED HER. [LAUGHTER]

Jon: YES.
YEAH, NO.
Jon: DO PEOPLE LURK. ARE THERE LURKERS THAT APPEAR --?
THESE ARE YOU KNOW THE CAMERA PHONES ARE POPULAR ON SET. WE HAVE A GUY IN CROATIA WE HAVE THIS ENORMOUS GUY WHO THAT IS HIS JOB TO JUST -- [LAUGHTER] HE WILL YELL AT THEM IN CROATIAN AND IT'S TERRIFYING. BUT HE WILL JUST TAKE YOUR PHONE AND THROW IT. AND IT'S SO REFRESHING. I WISH I HAD THE NERVE TO DO THAT.
Jon: I WOULD LOVE IF THAT GUY THEN GOES HOME FROM WORK. HEY HONEY, HOW WAS WORK? GOOD DAY, THREW PHONES. TOOK PHONE THREW IT.

WE SHOOT IN THE STUDIO WE CONVERTED IT. WHERE THEY PAINTED THE TITANIC.
Jon: THEY DID.
AND NOW THEY OPENED UP A TITANIC MUSEUM NEXT DOOR TO THE STUDIO.
Jon: I ALWAYS FOUND THAT ODD.
IT'S A BAD OMEN.
Jon: BECAUSE IF YOU MADE THE TITANIC WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A MUSEUM? LOOK AT WHAT WE SCREWED UP.
I KNOW. IT'S A BIT STRANGE.
Jon: IT'S ODD RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M NOT --
Jon: CAN I GET AN X-MEN SPOILER? CAN I GET A LITTLE DAYS OF FUTURE PAST?

Jon: NO IT'S NOT THE SPRAY IT'S THE SALT AND PEPPER SHAKE CAN. THEY DO THAT NOW LIKE MY HEAD IS FLOUR AND THEY JUST SIFT IT.
I'M GETTING A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER IN THE BEARD. SORRY I DIDN'T SHAVE.
Jon: REALLY A LITTLE BIT. YOU ARE NOT COLORING THAT.
IT'S THE UNEMPLOYED SPECIAL.
Jon: IF I THREW DOWN AND I COULD GROW IT BECAUSE I'M A HIRSUTE FELLOW I COULD DO IT PROBABLY BEFORE COMMERCIAL BREAK. IT'S MOSES. IT'S ALL WHITE NOW. IT'S ALL GONE. AND I'M NOT THAT MUCH OLDER THAN YOU, -- AM I?
