[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CHIEF  NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT FOR THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" MAGAZINE AND HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THIS  TOWN."  PLEASE WELCOME MARK LIEBOVITZ.   ( APPLAUSE ) [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
YES! John: SO THIS BOOK IS FUNNY. IT'S INTERESTING. AND IT IS DEMORALIZING.
THANK YOU. John: I MEAN I GUESS PEOPLE  GENERALLY HAVE QUITE A LOW  OPINION OF WASHINGTON. AND THIS BOOK SEEMS TO POINT OUT  THAT THAT LOW OPINION MAY BE TOO  HIGH. IT PROVES IT OVER 370 DISGUSTING  PAGES.
THANK YOU. DID YOU GET TO THE MISERY  SECTION?
John: I MEAN, YOU TALK ABOUT  HOW EARLY ON IN THIS BOOK YOU  TALK ABOUT HOW D.C. REWARDS MORE THAN ANYTHING SELF-PER PET  IATION.
IT DOES. John: BOY, OH, BOY, IS THAT  TRUE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FOCUSED  ON THE NUGGETS AND THE GOSSIP OF  THIS BOOK. WOW, EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT. THERE'S A BIG POINT HERE WHICH  IS THAT WASHINGTON HAS BECOME A  PLACE THAT PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE. IT IS IS THIS CULTURE THAT IS IS  A PERMANENT FUEL CLASS IN THE  WORDS OF TOM COBURN WHO IS A  SENATOR. IT JUST KEEPS SUSTAINING ITSELF. IT'S THE WEALTHIEST COMMUNITY IN  THE UNITED STATES. THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HAS  STRUGGLEDDED IN CONCERT WITH IT. IT'S JUST BEEN THIS TIPPING  POINT OF SELF-CELEBRATION THAT I  WANTED TO CHRONICLE.
John: AS IRRITATING AS THE  SPINE OF THE ARGUMENT OF THIS  BOOK IS, THE WAY IT'S BEING REVIEWED HAS IRRITATED ME EVEN  MORE. LOTS OF PEOPLE SAY, OH, YEAH,  THAT'S A FUNNY STORY ABOUT  VALERIE JARRETT. THERE IS A BLACK HEART AT THE  CENTER OF THIS.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK  YOU. GREAT.
John: FEEL FREE TO PUT THAT  ON THE NEXT BOOK. THERE'S A BLACK HEART IN THE  CENTER OF THIS BOOK. ENJOY. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT  THE REVOLVING DOOR.
SURE  John: THROUGH D.C. BECAUSE  YOU MENTION THE ATLANTIC POINTS  OUT IN 1974, 3% OF RETIRING MEMBERS BECAME LOBBYISTS. NOW 50% OF SENATORS.
50% OF SENATORS, 42% OF  CONGRESSMEN.
John: THAT IS A PROBLEM, IS  IS IT NOT?
YOU WOULD THINK. PEOPLE COME TO WASHINGTON. THEY RAN AGAINST WASHINGTON AS  THIS SWAMP. THEY SAY I'M GOING TO DRAIN THE  SWAMP. THEN THEY SETTLE INTO THE PLACE  LIKE A WARM BATH. IT'S A VERY MONEYED AND VERY  EASY AND VERY COMFORTABLE PLACE. FRANKLY I MEAN I TRIED TO  ILLUSTRATE THIS CARNIVAL IT HAS  ALWAYS BECOME
Reporter: THE IDEA THAT THERE  WAS A PAY-OFF TO PUBLIC SERVICE  IS CANCEROUS IN TERMS OF  GOVERNMENT.
YOU WOULD THINK. I MEAN THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY A CITY  BUILT ON PUBLIC SERVICE. I MEAN, YES, IT'S HOLLYWOOD FOR  UGLY PEOPLE IT IS SAID. THAT'S THE CLICHE. BUT IN FACT HOLLYWOOD IS  FANTASY, RIGHT? I MEAN THERE'S BIG MONEY THERE  AND EGOS THERE. WASHINGTON IS FOR KEEPS. I MEAN WASHINGTON IS PAID FOR BY  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WASHINGTON IS SUPPOSEDLY, YOU  KNOW, A LAND OF A HIGHER OR A  CITY OF A HIGHER CALLING. THAT'S JUST BEEN TOTALLY TIPPED  ON ITS HEAD
John: THIS IDEA THAT YOU  MENTIONED IN HERE OF IT'S FINE  FOR POLITICIANS TO LEAVE WASHINGTON AND FINE FOR PEOPLE  TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND SAY  WASHINGTON NEEDS CHANGING. WASHINGTON WILL NOT HOLD THAT  AGAINST YOU BECAUSE THEY KNOW  THAT EITHER YOU'RE LYING OR, TWO, THEY'LL GET YOU.
THEY WILL. I MEAN, LOOK. IT IS A VERY, VERY EASY CULTURE  TO BE CO-OPED INTO. I THINK THE OBAMA CHANGE BRIGADE  OF 2008 IS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE  OF IT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THAT  WAS INSENIOR. IT WAS A VERY GOOD MARKETING  STRATEGY IN 200 BUT IF YOU LOOK  AT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE OBAMA PROMISES AND THE IDEALS OF WE'RE  NOT NOT GOING TO OPT OUT OF THE  CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM, WE'RE NOT GOING TO WORK WITH THE SUPER  PACs IN 2012 AND ALL THE  NEVER-MINDS THEY'VE DONE IT IS SOMEWHAT DEMORALIZING EVEN AS A  JOURNALIST
John: IT'S FASHIONABLE TO SAY  WASHINGTON IS ROTTEN TO THE  CORE. BUT IT'S NOT. BECAUSE TO SAY IT'S ROTTEN TO  THE CORE WOULD BE TO IMPLY THAT  IT WAS ON THE EDGE OF  COLLAPSING. THIS IS SOME STRUCTURAL SOUND  BULL [BLEEP] THAT IS BUILT  THERE, JUST BUILT ON NUGGETS OF SELF-INTEREST EVERYWHERE. IT WORKS GREAT. D.C. IS MAKING [BLEEP] TON OF  MONEY.
YES, IT IS. ONE OF THE DIRTY LITTLE SEE  DECREES ABOUT WASHINGTON IS  EVERYONE FOCUSES ON HOW HOPELESSLY DIVIDED WASHINGTON  IS. WASHINGTON IS HOPELESSLY  INTERCONNECTED. THERE'S A MAX I AM THERE,  THERE'S NO SUCH THINGS AS  DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS. ONLY MILLIONAIRES. THE DYSFUNCTION THAT YOU SEE ON,  YOU KNOW, IN CABLE SETS ON THE  FLOORS OF CONGRESS, THINGS NOT GETTING DONE, THAT'S VERY GOOD  FOR BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE, YOU KNOW,  WASHINGTON AGAIN, A LOT OF  PEOPLE ARE GETTING RICH IN WASHINGTON WHILE THE REST OF THE  COUNTRY SUFFERS
John: EVEN WITH THIS  ADMINISTRATION, YOU LOOK AT  SOMEONE LIKE JAKE, TOP OBAMA TREASURY OFFICIAL. HAD TO COMBAT GOLDMAN SACHS THE  WHOLE TIME HE WAS THERE. THE ABSOLUTE CENTER OF THE SUB  PRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS. HE LEAVES TO BECOME HEAD OF  GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR GUESS  WHO, GOLDMAN SACHS.
RIGHT. John: A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE  OFFICIAL IN THIS BOOK SAYS WE  ARE LAPSING INTO SELF-PARODY.
THEY MIGHT GET SPANKED FOR A  DAY OR SO BUT THERE'S NO PRICE  TO PLACE. THE LEVEL OF SHAME IN WASHINGTON  IS VERY, VERY LOW. THE LEVEL OF SELF-AWARENESS IN  WASHINGTON IS VERY, VERY LOW. FRANKLY THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO  STOP.
John: CAN YOU STICK AROUND TO  TALK BECAUSE I NEED TO TALK SOME  OF THIS POISON OUT OF MY SYSTEM.
HAPPY TO HELP. John: "THIS TOWN" IS ON THE  BOOK SHELVES NOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
