PRECISELY, JON. GREAT ANALYSIS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOW --
JON WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS CODIFIED TODAY IS THAT MONEY IS INDEED EQUIVALENT TO SPEECH. IN OTHER WORDS MO MONEY MO PRONOUNS.
Jon: BY THAT LOGIC CUTTING ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS COULD BE A FORM OF CENSORSHIP?
HOW IS THAT? JON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT AMERICA YOU LIVE IN THIS THIS AMERICA YOU EARN THE RIGHT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR MONEY.
Jon: NOT ALL RICH PEOPLE HAVE EARNED THEIR MONEY. SOME OF THEM HAVE WHAT YOU CALL, YOU KNOW, VERY TALKATIVE PARENTS WHO --

Jon: DID YOU JUST SAY FUNDED -- YOU SAID FUNDED?
FUNDED, NO FOUNDED.
Jon: YOU SAID FUNDED. YOU SAID FUNDED.
I DID NOT. THE PRINCIPLES SET IN PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY BY OUR FUNDING FATHERS.
Jon: YOU SAID IT AGAIN. YOU SAID FUNDED.
I ASSURE YOU I DIDN'T. CAN I JUST BLING YOU BACK TO THE POINT?
Jon: ASSIF IF MONEY EQUALS SPEECH AS INCOME INEQUALITY GROWS, POOR PEOPLE DON'T GET A VOICE.
OF COURSE THEY DO IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A LEVEL THAT [WHISPERING] -- REPRESENTS THEIR SIGNIFICANCE.
