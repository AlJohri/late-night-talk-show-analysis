[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO, SO, THERE WE GO. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE? TWISTED AROUND THERE? BOOM.
IN THE WAKE OF THE UKRAINE PLANE CRASH, ONE THING IS CERTAIN. BARACK OBAMA AIN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING. HE STOPPED PRESIDENTING LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. NOW HE JUST SITS AROUND IN HIS UNDERWEAR EATING CHEESE DOODLES, GROWING HIS FINGERNAILS OUT AND WATCHING THE SAME EPISODE OF THE "GOLDEN GIRLS" OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT'S TRUE. JESUS, ALL RIGHT... I SHOULD LOOK AT THESE IN REHEARSAL. AND APPARENTLY HE'S WHITE AND HAS THE SAME BODY THAT WE USE FOR A BIT WE DID WITH STEVE CARELL LIKE 12 YEARS AGO. ANYWAY, MY POINT IS THIS: WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT RUSSIA?
WELL, WHAT WE NEED DO IS WE HAVE TO MATCH STRENGTH AGAINST STRENGTH. WE REALLY NEED TO SHOW RUSSIA THAT WE WILL, YOU KNOW, MATCH THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND WE'LL HELP UKRAINE MATCH THAT SO THEY CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES.
Jon: SMART. WE SEND THEIR GUYS WEAPONS AND THEN RUSSIA SENDS THEIR GUYS MORE WEAPONS SO WE SEND MORE WEAPONS, YADDA, YADDA, YADDA, WORLD PEACE. OKAY. ONE OF YOU IDIOTS HAS TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT CANCELING THE WORLD CUP. WHY SHOULD COUNTRIES BE GOING IN THE WORLD CUP TO MOSCOW?
Jon: NICE. SO NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THE ONE GROUP MORE CORRUPT AND THUGGISH THAN RUSSIA. YEAH, OKAY, THAT'S REAL SMART. SO THOSE ARE ALL ACTIONS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT ACTIONS, ACTIONS ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING. BECAUSE THERE'S ONE THING THAT SPEAKS LOUDER THAN ACTIONS.
WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION NOT YET PREPARED TO DO THAT YOU THINK MUST BE DONE?
ONE, HE DIDN'T CALL PUTIN THE THUG THAT HE IS.
Jon: YES! STICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK HIS BONES, BUT NAMES, IS THAT HOW I SEEM TO PEOPLE? [LAUGHTER] THEY, THEY THINK I'M THUGGISH? I'VE WRESTLED ALLIGATORS AND BEARS, BUT NONE OF THEM EVER HURT ME LIKE WORDS. SO, YOU KNOW WHAT, HE WAS... ALL RIGHT. SO THE QUESTION IS THIS: WHAT'S THE RIGHT MODEL FOR A PRESIDENT IN THIS SITUATION. AND THE ANSWER BE:
WE SAW HOW REAGAN RESPONDED TO THE SOVIETS BACK THEN.
Jon: YES, REAGAN. ST. RONNY DEALT WITH A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION. IN 1983 WHEN THE SOVIET UNION SHOT DOWN A KOREAN PASSENGER PLANE OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN. I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW HE RESPONDED. HOW DID HE RESPOND?
REAGAN WAS AT THE RANCH IN CALIFORNIA. HE IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK.
RUSHED HOME FROM SANTA BARBARA VACATION.
HE IMMEDIATELY CAME HOME AND IMMEDIATELY BE BRIEFED, IMMEDIATELY GET MOVING FORWARD AND CONDEMN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE STRONGEST TERMS POSSIBLE.
Jon: IMMEDIATELY, PLANE CRASHES, THEY GO TO TELL REAGAN ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT HE'S ALREADY GONE. THE SCENT OF AFTER SHAVE AND JELLYBEANS THE ONLY THING LINGERING IN THE AIR. HOW DID HE SPRING INTO ACTION SO FAST? TO THIS DAY NOBODY KNOWS, BUT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT, REAGAN TOOK ALL OF RUSSIA'S MISSILES, TWIRLED THEM UP SINGLE HANDEDLY AND THREW THEM INTO THE SUN. WAIT A MINUTE. I'M SORRY. THAT LAST PART WASN'T REAGAN. IT WAS SUPERMAN. BUT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. THE POINT IS REAGAN ACTED WITHOUT DELAY.
I WAS COVERING RONALD REAGAN AT THAT TIME. HE WAS IN SANTA BARBARA AT HIS RANCH WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AND QUITE FRANKLY, HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. AND HIS ADVISERS REALIZED HOW TERRIBLE THIS LOOKED AND EVENTUALLY PERSUADED HIM HE HAD TO FLY BACK TO WASHINGTON AND HAD TO MAKE THE SPEECH TO THE NATION, BUT IT DID TAKE HIM FOUR DAYS.  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT? [CLEARS THROAT] YES, REAGAN'S RESPONSE TO THAT CATASTROPHE WAS SO SPECIAL, SO REMARKABLE, IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE US FORGET WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. [LAUGHTER] WHICH IS THAT REAGAN GRUDGINGLY CUT SHORT HIS 25-DAY VACATION AFTER BEING CAUGHT ON CAMERA RIDING A HORSE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. LET'S READ FROM HIS ACTUAL DIARY ABOUT THE INCIDENT. [CLEARS THROAT] [AS RONALD REAGAN]: FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 2ND, THE SOVIETS SHOT DOWN A KOREAN AIRLINER WITH 269 PASSENGERS, 53 OF THEM AMERICANS, INCLUDING CONGRESSMAN LARRY McDONALD. WE WERE DUE TO RETURN TO WASHINGTON ON LABOR DAY BUT REALIZED WE COULDN'T WAIT. WE LEFT ON FRIDAY. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING, DASH, I HAD REALLY LOOKED FORWARD TO THOSE LAST THREE DAYS. PUNCTUATION REAGANS. YES. REAGAN WAS IN DEEP MOURNING FOR LOSING THE FINAL 12% OF HIS VACATION. IN FACT, IN 1988, WHEN THE U.S. ACCIDENTALLY SHOT DOWN AN IRANIAN AIRLINER, ALSO UNDER REAGAN'S WATCH, REAGAN REFUSED TO END THAT VACATION EARLY. AND BY THE WAY, AMERICA WAS SO TORN UP ABOUT SHOOTING DOWN THAT PLANE THAT THE COMMANDER OF THE SHIP WHO DID IT LATER RECEIVED A MEDAL FOR HIS SERVICE. I BRIEF IT WAS CALLED THE SILVER OH, EW, OH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
