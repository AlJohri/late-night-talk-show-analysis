[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
John: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  YOU MIGHT NOTICE THINGS LOOK A  LITTLE BIT WEIRD. [LAUGHTER] FUNNY STORY. AT THE END OF THE LAST SEGMENT,  BASICALLY THE STUDIO EXPLODED. WE LOST ALL POWER TO OUR CAMERAS  AND MONITORS AND IT SEEMS I HAVE  NOW OFFICIALLY BROKEN "THE DAILY SHOW." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO WE'RE NOW DOING THE SHOW ON  THESE TWO HANDHELDS. AND I'M JOINED BY THE INCREDIBLE  AARON SORKIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AARON, WE HAVE... WE HAD A CLIP  FROM "THE NEWSROOM."  WE'RE GOING TO PLAY IT NOW FOR THE PEOPLE AT HOME BY EDITING IT  IN. YOU AND I ARE NOW JUST GOING TO  SIT IN 30 SECONDS OF COMPLETE  SILENCE. OKAY. ROLL THE CLIP.
LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT  UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
SURE.
THE WOMAN WE HAD ON FRIDAY  NIGHT FROM O.W.S., SHELLY WETS  HER.
YEAH,
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO  APOLOGIZE TO HER.
SURE.
ON AIR?
ABSOLUTELY.
SO NO.
WHAT WERE THE CONSEQUENCES?
SARAH'S BEEN CHASING A STORY. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT  IT IS.
WHY?
IF I TELL YOU THE REASON,  YOU'LL BE MORE CURIOUS ABOUT THE  STORY.
NOW I'M MORE CURIOUS ABOUT  THE REASON.
THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT  SUGGESTS THE ARMY IS THINKING OF  HAVING DIFFERENT UNIFORMS FOR HOME AND AWAY GAMES.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S REALLY  THE STORY.
John: 29, 30... IT LOOKS GREAT.
THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
John: "THE NEWSROOM" IS  BACK, SUNDAY, EVERY 10:00. EVERY 10:00 ON A SUNDAY. I'VE NOW JUST LOST POWER TO MY  MOUTH. IT'S... I HAVE TO SAY, WHEN I  FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE DOING  IT, I FELT LIKE A GUY IN THAT OLD JEWISH JOKE WATCHING HIS  WIFE HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER MAN  THINKING, AARON, I HAVE TO WATCH BASIC CABLE NEWS EVERY DAY, BUT  YOU, WHY DID YOU PUT YOURSELF  THROUGH THIS?
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A  REALLY COOL WORKPLACE TO SET A  DRAMA. I ALSO LIKED THE IDEA OF HAVING  IT ALWAYS TAKE PLACE IN THE  RECENT PAST, NOT SO THAT I COULD LEVERAGE HINDSIGHT INTO HEROISM,  NOT SO THAT I COULD SHOW THE  PROFESSIONALS LIKE YOU HOW IT'S DONE, BUT JUST BECAUSE... [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] BUT JUST BECAUSE...
John: IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT  I'D FIGHT BACK, BUT I HAVE TO  CONCEDE.
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE THE  DYNAMIC THAT HAPPENS WHEN THE  AUDIENCE KNOWS MORE THAN THE CHARACTERS DO. SO SOMETHING COMES OVER I-NEWS,  SOMETHING COMES OVER THE WIRE  THAT SAYS THERE'S A PROTEST STARTING OUTSIDE THE AMERICAN  CONSULATE IN BENGHAZI, THE  AUDIENCE IMMEDIATELY KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE GET TO  WATCH THE PROCESS OF THE  CHARACTERS IN "THE NEWSROOM," HOW THEY FIND OUT.
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE  EVENTS OF 18 MONTHS AGO. YOU'RE NAVIGATING THE 2012  ELECTION AGAIN. AND, OF COURSE, SPOILER ALERT,  IT'S EXPENSIVE AND DEPRESSING.
RIGHT, RIGHT. YOU'RE GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED  ANYONE WHO IS TUNING INTO THE  SHOW TO FIND OUT WHO WON THE 2012 ELECTION.
I WISH THAT WAS ZERO PEOPLE,  BUT I THINK WE BOTH KNOW THERE  MIGHT BE PEOPLE GOING, OH, WHO IS PRESIDENT NOW?
SO THESE ARE JUST... THE NEWS  STORIES THEMSELVES SERVE AS A  BACK DROP AGAINST WHICH TO TELL OTHER STORIES, JUST LIKE WHEN  YOU GO SEE "TITANS ALL ACCESS,"  YOU KNOW THE SHIP'S NOT GOING TO BE PULLING INTO NEW YORK HARBOR. SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN  HALF-WAY THROUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE BAD. IT'S GOING TO BE AN ICEBERG. YOU KNOW THAT. BUT YOU'LL TELL ANOTHER STORY  AGAIN.
AND THE AMAZING THING ABOUT  THIS SERIES IS THAT IT IS TAKING  PLACE IN FLASHBACK BECAUSE THERE IS THIS STORY THAT THE NETWORK  HAS SCREWED UP. WAS THIS BASED ON CNN'S TAIL  WIND OR THAT MISTAKE OR WAS IT  BASED ON MANY OF THE OTHER MISTAKES YOU SEE AT THE END OF  TIME.
NO, IT WAS INSPIRED BY  OPERATION DAILY WIND, WHICH IN  1998, CNN WAS LAUNCHING A NEW PROGRAM IN CONGRESS JUNCTION  WITH "TIME" MAGAZINE AND THEIR  VERY FIRST BROADCAST PROMISED TO BLOW THE LID OFF OPERATION TAIL  WIND, IN WHICH THEY ALLEGE THAT  1970 THE U.S. ARMY USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ABOUT 100  CIVILIANS IN LAOS. BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT THE  ENTIRE STORY WAS BASED ON AN  INTERVIEW THAT ONE OF THE PRODUCERS HAD. BASICALLY THEY WERE INTERVIEWING  A FORMER MEMBER OF THE JOINT  CHIEFS OF STAFF, WHO THE PRODUCER SWEARS OFF CAMERA SAID  THIS HAPPENED, WE USED SARIN GAS  IN LAOS ON CIVILIANS. ONCE HE GOT ON CAMERA, HE GOT  COLD FEET AND SAID, BASICALLY,  IF WE USED SARIN GAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG. AND THE PRODUCER EDITED THAT  INTO "WE USED SARIN GAS AND IT  WAS WRONG."  EVERYBODY OFFERED RESIGNATION, PEOPLE WERE FIRED, IT'S A  DISASTER.
WE'RE SO INSTINCTIVELY  CYNICAL ABOUT THE NEWS NOW THAT  WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WATCH YOUR CHARACTERS, WHO ARE  INTENTIONALLY WELL MEANING,  GRADUALLY MAKE A HUGE MISTAKE.
YEAH. HOPEFULLY YOU'LL... THE MISTAKE  WILL BE UNDERSTANDABLE. YOU'LL SEE HOW YOU COULD HAVE  MADE THAT MISTAKE, TOO. NOT THE MISTAKE AT THE CENTER OF  IT. WE HAVE AN ACTOR ON THE SHOW  NAMED SHAMISH LINKLATTER THAT IS  FANTASTIC. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD HAVE  DONE WHAT HE DID, BUT GIVEN THAT  SOMEBODY DID AND NOBODY KNEW ABOUT IT, I THINK PEOPLE OF GOOD  INTENTIONS WOULD HAVE GONE ALONG  WITH IT.
I TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IS AN  UNDERSTANDABLE MISTAKE, AND THIS  IS LOSING THE POWER TO YOUR  STUDIO. I CANNOT... YOU CANNOT BLAME  PEOPLE FOR THAT.
I ABSOLUTELY DON'T BLAME  PEOPLE FOR THAT. IT'S REALLY BACK THERE. IT'S A HEALTH SCAPE. IT'S AMAZING.
John: DON'T SAY THAT. HE'S LYING, JON. THE SHOW'S FINE. "NEWSROOM" IS ON HBO AT 10:00  P.M. ON SUNDAYS. AARON SORKIN, LADIES AND
