FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. [APPLAUSE]
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT, WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER FOR YOUR PLEASURE AND ENJOYMENT OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE GREAT BLONDIE. WILL BE JOINING US. [CROWD CHEERING] WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE THAT. WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY THAT GOOD. THESE PEOPLE THEY'REE VERY LUCKY. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THOUGH, IT'S BEEN A HARD TIME FOR THE NEWS MEDIA LATELY. YOU GOT THE ABSENCE OF ANY NEW MISSING MALAYSIAN PLANES. [LAUGHTER] CNN IS SO DESPERATE THEY ACTUALLY COVERED SOME GUY WHO SAID HE FOUND THE SANTA MARIA. [LAUGHTER] OF THE NINA, THE PINTA AND SANTA MARIA FAME. APPARENTLY, CNN IS JUST GOING TO GO BACK AND LOOK FOR LOST INCREASINGLY OLDER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION. [LAUGHTER] UP NEXT ARCHEOLOGISTS DISCOVERED A KIND OF FOOT-POWERED CAVE CAR. MARTIN SAVAGE IS IN A CAVE SIMULATOR RIGHT NOW. IT'S BEEN TERRIBLE TIME FOR THE NEWS MEDIA. IT ALL SEEM SO HOPELESS. AND THEN A MIRACLE.
CAUGHT ON TAPE, THE VIDEO EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT.
FAMILY FEUD.
SHOCKING SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.
BEYONCE'S LITTLE SISTER SOLANGE VIOLENTLY ATTACKING HER SUPER FAMOUS MOGUL BROTHER-IN-LAW, JAY Z.
SHE'S KICKING HIM. NOW YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP WATCHING THIS VIDEO TAPE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ROLLING IT.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE WE'LL MAKE YOU WATCH IT. LOOK AT IT. GAZE UPON IT. LOOK AT IT. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THE INTERNET WAS FOR, BUT OK. WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE FIRST FAMILY OF POP MUSIC TO TEAR ITSELF ASUNDER IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S ROC NATION IN CRISIS, TROUBLE IN BEYADISE NEWS POWERS ACTIVATE, FORM OF BASELESS SPECULATION!
SOLANGE RECENTLY LEFT ROCK NATION A YEAR AGO TO START HER OWN RECORD LABEL SAINT RECORDS. SO, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT A RECORD LABEL.
SURE, IT COULD BE A FUED ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, SOME ARTISTS SUE THE RECORD LABEL LIKE PRINCE. OTHERS TRY AND KICK THEIR RECORD LABEL IN THE FACE. [LAUGHTER] SO MAYBE THIS IS A BUSINESS DEAL GONE WRONG, CLASSIC KICK-FIGHT MOTIVATION.
IT'S A COMPLETE RUMOR. AND THEY SAY THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S SOME INFIDELITY INVOLVED.
WAS SOLANGE, DID SHE HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK? IS THAT WHY SHE AT LEAST APPEARS TO HAVE A RATHER SHORT FUSE.
Jon: AH, INFIDELITY PLUS INSOBRIETY COMBINED WITH THE POWERFUL G FORCES OF VERTICAL DESCENT. A DANGEROUS COCKTAIL.
HE APPARENTLY WANTED TO DITCH HER AND BEYONCE TO GO PARTY WITH RIHANNA AFTER THE MET GALA. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon: I WOULD TOTALLY DO THAT TOO. TOTALLY PARTY WITH RIHANNA. RIRI IS LIKE, SHE'S SO COOL. WITH ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLY WELL-SOURCED MOTIVES, I CAN'T BELIEVE SOLANGE DIDN'T SPEND THE ENTIRE MET BALL KICKING JAY-Z IN THE FACE. WHY WAIT TIL THE ELEVATOR? PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TO BASELESS SPECULATION TO SPECULATION OF A MORE PERSONAL NATURE.
I HAVE A SISTER THAT I FEEL SO PROTECTIVE OF. I THINK THIS IS A STORY OF A LITTLE SISTER STICKING UP FOR HER SISTER.
THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER BEEN FIRED UP, AND NOT LIKE THAT, I MEAN I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT TO A MAN MY SISTER USED TO BE MARRIED TO BUT I DIDN'T. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  APPARENTLY A LOT OF THE NEWS MEDIA WAS IN A CLUB CALLED THE SISTERHOOD OF THE TRAVELING KICK TO THE NUTS. OF COURSE, THOSE WITHOUT SISTERS BUT WHO MAY HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL DEMONS MIGHT HAVE VIEWED THIS STORY THROUGH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LENS.
HOW DOES TMZ GET ALL THIS STUFF, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
THAT'S THE QUESTION. IT'S THE ELEVATOR SECURITY SYSTEM IN THE HOTEL AND THE HOTEL SAID THEY WERE GOING TO FIRE ANYBODY WHO COULD FIND IT, WHO LEAKED IT-- HOW IN THE WORLD DOES TMZ COME UP WITH THIS? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I MEAN, THEY DON'T HAVE CAMERAS IN ALL THE ROOMS DO THEY? I MEAN, IT'S NOT, I MEAN, NOT THAT I'VE DONE ANYTHING IN A HOTEL I WOULDN'T WANT THE WORLD TO SEE. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POOL? DO THEY HAVE CAMERAS BY THE POOL? I NEED TO CALL A LAWYER. [LAUGHTER] BUT THEN SUDDENLY LIKE A HEALED FOOT FLASHING THROUGH A FRAME, IT ALL CAME CRASHING DOWN.
I'VE GOT TO RAIN ON THE PARADE A LITTLE BIT HERE. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ELEVATOR BUT WHAT'S MORE I DON'T CARE.
WHAT? I THINK THE CORE OF THIS STORY IS NOT REALLY A STORY.
Jon:  WE'VE GOT A CODE 9.  WE'VE GOT A RUNNER. SOMEONE HIT THE TRAP DOOR. WE GOT A RUNNER. CODE 9. THE BABY IS IN THE WELL. THE BABY IS IN THE WELL.  [LAUGHTER] I'M I'M, I HAVE LIKE A, IT'S LIKE A SPECIAL DEVICE WHERE I TALK TO OTHER. BY THE WAY, THAT'S CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY. HE'S AN EDITOR AT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. SO IT'S A PRINCE SITUATION. HE'S BRINGING A WORD PROCESSOR TO A VIDEO FIGHT.
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH YOU. I THINK IT'S A STORY BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST.
PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PORNOGRAPHY TOO AND WE DON'T ALWAYS COVER THAT. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon:  THAT'S TRUE. AND, EVEN WHEN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL DOES COVER PORNOGRAPHY, THEY DO IT WITH CLASS. [LAUGHTER] CLASSIC POINTALLISM. COME ON, MR. HIGH AND MIGHTY FOURTH ESTATE, YOU CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE THIS PRIVATE FAMILY QUARREL STOLEN FROM AN IN-HOUSE SURVEILLANCE FEED ISN'T NATIONAL NEWS.
I MEAN IT MATTERS WHAT'S A STORY. DONALD STERLING'S A STORY BECAUSE THERE'S RACISM INVOLVED.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NEWS WORTHY. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S NEWSWORTHY.
EXACTLY
YOU HAVE CELEBRITIES IN AN ELEVATOR FIGHTING.
CELEBRITIES IN AN ELEVATOR FIGHTING. WE HAVEN'T SEEN SUCH A THING SINCE NBC'S HIT REALITY SHOW. CELEBRITIES IN AN ELEVATOR FIGHTING. RAN FOR ELEVEN SEASONS BUT SINCE THEN NOTHING. THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T MIX PRINT JOURNALISTS WITH TV PEOPLE. IT JUST MAKES EVERYBODY SAD AND ASHAMED. NO ONE MORE SO THAN CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO.
YOU ARE PLACING A HIGH BAR THAT IS CLEARLY NOT OBSERVED CERTAINLY BY THE ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA.
A HIGH BAR?
I LIKE YOUR BAR. I WISH IT WERE A REALITY, I WISH IT WERE THE TRUTH. I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO COVER IT.
Jon: DIDN'T HAVE -- WHO IS MAKING YOU, WHO IS MAKING YOU DO THIS?  [LAUGHTER] I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID BUT WE CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS YOU TELL -- JUST SHOW US, SHOW US ON JEFF, SHOW US ON THE JEFF ZUCKER HOW DID HE FORCE YOU? WHAT DID HE USE TO FORCE YOU?  [LAUGHTER] BEFORE, LET'S GO OUT TO SENIOR BEYONCE CORRESPONDENT, JESSICA WILLIAMS. SHE'S ON THE SCENE, AT THE STANDARD HOTEL. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon: JESSICA.
HI, JON. HELLO.
Jon: SO MUCH SPECULATION ON WENT DOWN ON THAT ELEVATOR. WHAT'S YOUR THEORY?
THEORY, JON, I'M SENIOR BEYONCE CORRESPONDENT. I DON'T NEED THEORIES, I KNOW. THAT SO-CALLED SECURITY CAM FOOTAGE IS NOTHING BUT ANOTHER BRILLIANT QUEEN B VIRAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN.
Jon: WHAT?
SO, WELL DONE HOV AND B.
Jon:  HOV AND B, HOV AND B.
WELL DONE, WELL DONE.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING, THIS IS, THE ELEVATOR FIGHT IS STAGED.
OH YEAH, JON. 110%. DIDN'T YOU NOTICE ANYTHING WEIRD ABOUT THAT VIDEO?
Jon: WELL IT SEEMED TO BE A RANDOM BURST OF ONPROVOKED VIOLENCE, SO YEAH, I GUESS --
NO, JON. SOMETHING WEIRD ABOUT BEYONCE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  NO, I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE ANY --
JON, SHE'S STANDING STILL.
Jon: WELL I DON'T BLAME HER. FISTS ARE FLYING. SHE'S WEARING A LOW CUT GOWN. IF SHE MOVES THERE COULD BE A WARDROBE SITUATION, SIDE BOOB-ALANCHE IF YOU WILL. YOU KNOW. THIS IS CLEARLY THE OLD OCCAM'S BOOBAGE PRINCIPLE. IN THE FACE OF COMPETING THEORIES, THE ONE ABOUT PRECARIOUS CLEAVAGE IS USUALLY CONNECT.
NO WAY, JON, THIS IS BEYONCE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SHE'S WEARING. BEYONCE IS NEVER NOT MOVING. THE WOMAN IS PURE KINETIC ENERGY PERSONIFIED. IF THAT ELEVATOR VIDEO WERE REAL SHE WOULD BE ALL UP IN THERE, ARMS WAVING, FEET FLYING, FISTS PUMPING, BOOTY BUMPING. SHE WOULD BE LIKE A NINJA TURTLE MEETS A ROCKETTE, JON. IT WOULD BE PHYSICALLY OUT OF CONTROL. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon: NO, BUT JESS, THAT'S NOT, THAT'S NOT TRUE. THOSE WERE MUSIC VIDEOS. MUSIC VIDEOS ARE CHOREOGRAPHED. IN REALY LIFE, SHE'S NOT BOOTY BUMPING 24/7. IT'S JUST NOT --
OK, I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME, JON, WHY DID YOU HIRE A SENIOR BEYONCE CORRESPONDENT, AGAIN? HUH?
Jon:  BECAUSE I'M NOT A BEYONCE EXPERT.
EXACTLY. SO, WHY DON'T YOU STAY IN YOUR LANE AND I'LL STAY IN MINE. BECAUSE WHEN I SAY SHE'S NEVER NOT MOVING, JUST OKAY, HERE'S BEYONCE AT THE DMV GETTING HER LICENSE RENEWED. HERE SHE IS GETTING A ROOT CANAL. THIS WAS HER GETTING INTERVIEWED ON THE CHARLIE ROSE SHOW, JON.
Jon: OK, BUT IF THE ELEVATOR VIDEO IS A PROMOTIONAL STUNT, WHAT IS IT PROMOTING?
YOU KNOW, JON, IT COULD BE ANOTHER SECRET ALBUM, A NEW LINE OF GOLD JUMPSUITS. HECK, IT COULD BE SOLANGE'S NEW KICKBOXING FITNESS PROGRAM. WE DON'T KNOW.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
BUT MY GUESS THIS IS A PSA TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN IGNORED FOR FAR TOO LONG. YOU KNOW WHAT, ROLL IT, CHUCK.
HELLO, I'M DEBBIE HARRY, HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE SCOURGE OF PRIVATE ELEVATOR VIOLENCE. IT'S AN EMEPIDEMIC THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE FROM THE VERY FAMOUS TO THE INCREDIBLY FAMOUS. AND IF PRIVATE ELEVATOR VIOLENCE ISN'T STOPPED, THE DAY MIGHT SOON COME WHEN CELEBRITIES HAVE TO TAKE THE STAIRS. DO YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THAT WORLD? I KNOW I DON'T. SO, THE NEXT TIME YOU RIDE IN AN ELEVATOR WITH THE WORLD'S BIGGEST POP STARS, PLEASE THINK BEFORE YOU KICK. WAIT, WHY AM I HOLDING THIS?
JUST HOLD IT. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon:  THAT'S IT.
WOW, I WAS IN THAT PSA AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. SO, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S IT.  YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S JUST RAISE AWARENESS, PEOPLE. DO YOU GET IT? IT'S LIKE RAISE BECAUSE THEY WERE FIGHTING IN AN ELEVATOR
Jon:  YEAH, I GET IT.
JON, DO YOU GET IT, THOUGH?
I GET IT.
YOU CAN ALSO ELEVATE THE SITUATION.
Jon:  YES, I UNDERSTAND. JESSICA WILLIAMS EVERYBODY. I DO GET IT --
WELL, DO YOU, DO YOU?
Jon: I GET IT. [CROWD CHEERING]
