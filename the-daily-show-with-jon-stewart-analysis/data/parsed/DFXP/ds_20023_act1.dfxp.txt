FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS SHOW PLANNED FOR YOU THIS EVENING. WE HAVE PREPARED IT WITH THE GREATEST OF THE CARE, THE GREATEST OF LOVE, OUR GUEST TONIGHT A YOUNG ACTOR NAMED CAROL. (LAUGHTER) CARELL, STEVE CARELL. I'M NOT FAMILIAR BUT I HEAR GOOD THINGS. (LAUGHTER) BUT FIRST, LAST NIGHT WE POKED A LITTLE FUN AT THE APEC SUMMIT IN BEIJING FOR MAKING WORLD LEADERS WEAR GOOFY CLOTHES AND DISPLAYING WHAT I BELIEVE PYROTECHNIC PROFESSIONALS REFER TO AS FIREWORKS OUT THE YINYANG. (LAUGHTER) BUT FAIR'S FAIR. THERE WERE SOME RESULTS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT XI JINPING OF CHINA ANNOUNCED A MAJOR DEAL ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
THE WORLD'S TWO BIGGEST POLLUTERS AGREE TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS.
Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'S-- I HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. LESS CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE TWO OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST POLLUTERS. THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION. NO, THAT-- NO, THAT-- NO, NO, NO. THE FIREWORKS THINGS IS ACTUALLY WORKING-- OKAY. I THINK THIS DEAL IS GOING TO CALL FOR A BIT OF A CULTURAL SHIFT. BUT LISTEN, THIS IS GREAT, SO OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING REAL ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT CHINA ON BOARD. WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEXT ISSUE.
CHINESE GANGS ARE BEING ACCUSED OF SMUGGLING HUGE AMOUNTS OF IVORY FROM TANZANIA, WITH THE HELP OF TANZANIAN OFFICIALS.
CHINESE EMBASSY STAFF WERE MAJOR BUYERSES OF THE IVORY. THE CONSIGNMENTS OF IVORY WERE SENT TO CHINA IN DIPLOMATIC BAGS ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PLANE.
Jon: IVORY SENT IN DIPLOMATIC BAGS. WHAT-- WHAT IS THAT IN MY BAG? NO -- NO, IT'S NOT AN ELEPHANT TUSK, IT'S A GIANT DILDO. (LAUGHTER) NOT MADE OF IVORY. I HAVE THIS THING FOR INCREDIBLY OVERSIZED POINTY DILDOS. SO, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, THE PUNISHER AND I HAVE TO CATCH A PLANE. HOW YOU COULD, CHINA! PROVIDING A MARKET FOR ILLEGAL POACHERS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU, CHINA, CAN EVEN LOOK AT YOURSELF IN YOUR INCREDIBLY INTRICATELY CARVED GILDED IVORY MIRRORS. WHAT KIND OF SOULLESS AMORAL COUNTRY WITH BE THE LARGEST RETAIL MARKET FOR IVORY?
THE UNITED STATES IS THE SECOND LARGEST RETAIL MARKET FOR ELEPHANT IVORY.
HELLO. (LAUGHTER) WAIT, HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE? UNLESS THE I STANDS FOR IVORY. (LAUGHTER) I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS WHITE PLASTIC. NEEDLESS TO SAY OUR INSATIABLE HUNGER FOR IVORY TRINKETS, DID YOU ENJOY THAT, OUR INSATIABLE HUNGER FOR IVORY TRINKETS IS HAVING A CATASTROPHIC IMPACT ON THE IVORY'S ORIGINAL OWNERS.
100,000 ELEPHANTS WERE KILLED FOR THEIR TUSKS OVER JUST THREE YEARS. THE ANIMALS HAVE REACHED A TIPPING POINT. WITH MORE ELEPHANTS KILLED EACH YEAR THAN THOSE BEING BORN. IF IT CONTINUES, THEY WILL BE WIPED OUT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. IT'S CLEAR, WE'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS, PEOPLE. EITHER WE AS HUMANS CAN DECREASE OUR CONSUMPTION OF IVORY BY NO LONGER BUYING TRINKETS WE DON'T EVEN NEED. OR ELSE ELEPHANTS CAN LOSE THAT TWO YEAR GESTATION THING AND START SHOOTING OUT PUPS LIKE A T-SHIRT CANNON.  I MEAN CHOP CHOP, ELEPHANTS, YOUR CAREERS CAN WAIT. COME ON. START [BLEEP] COME ON! LOOK, CLEARLY WE'RE NOT  GOING TO SAVE ELEPHANTS BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THAT'S JUST NOT US. SO SWEETEN THE POT. WHAT'S IN IT FOR US, THE TUSKLESS.
TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE OF FAST CASH TO BUY GUNS AND FUND THE REST OF THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. THEY'RE SLAUGHTERING AFRICAN ELEPHANTS AND SELLING THE IVORY TUSKS FOR A LOT OF MONEY.
ONLY 1.6 TUSKS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND A SPECTACULAR DOUBLE TERRORIST ATTACK ON TWO EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAVING ELEPHANTS CAN ACTUALLY KEEP US FROM BEING VICTIMS IN TERRORIST ATTACKS. I MEAN, IF WE WILL TAKE OFF OUR SHOES AT AIRPORTS TO PREVENT TERRORISM, SURELY WE CAN STOP BUYING SOUVENIR IVORY FIGURINES MADE IN THE LIKENESS OF THE IVORY DONOR. APPARENTLY IVORY MONEY IS FUNDING ALMOST EVERY CIVIL WAR, GENOCIDAL MILITIA AND TERRORIST GROUP IN AFRICA, FROM AL SHABAAB TO BOKO HARAM. BUT YOU MIGHT BE SAYING TO YOURSELF, DIDN'T THE U.S. BAN IVORY IMPORTS IN LIKE 1989, TO WHICH I WOULD SAY OH, YOU HAVE A RESEARCH TEAM TOO? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT. BUT WE DID. WE DID BAN IT. BUT THAT WILL BE TUSK-SIZED LOOPHOLES IN IT ME BROTHER.
YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WALK THE STREETS OF NEW YORK AND FIND IVORY FOR SALE. AND IF YOU ARE A COP AND SAY I THINK YOUR IVORY IS ILLEGAL, THE FIRST THING THAT THE IVORY SELLER WILL SAY TO YOU IS NO, NO, NO, MINE IS ANTIQUE.
Jon: OH, IT'S ANTIQUE, ANTIQUE IVORY IS GRANDFATHERED, AND THAT IS THE LOOPHOLE. PEOPLE PRETEND THINGS ARE ANTIQUE. WELL GUESS WHAT, THAT'S NOT HOW OUR LAWS WORK FOR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU CAN'T SAY OH GEE, OFFICER, THAT COCAINE WAS PURCHASED BY MY GRANDMOTHER IN 1912. SO I THINK WE'RE GOOD HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT. BACK THEN PEOPLE WERE POLITE AND HAD RESPECT. WOULD YOU LIKE THE COCAINE? THAT'S WHY EARLIER THIS YEAR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A NEW BAN ON ALL COMMERCIAL IVORY SALES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. AND STRICTER DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ANTIQUES.
THE NEW REGULATIONS THEY EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THE BURDEN OF PROOF.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IT SHIFTS THE BURDEN OF PROOF FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO THE HOLDER OF THE IVORY TO PROVE ANY IVORY THEY HAVE IS  ANTIQUE.
Jon: NOW YOU KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THESE RULES, THERE ARE NO ANIMAL THEY WON'T PROTECT, THAT'S WHY THOUSANDS OF SEVEN YEAR OLDS' HEADS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE AS NATIONAL LICE PRESERVES. BUT REPUBLICANS, REPUBLICANS? ACCEPT A NEW REGULATION FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, EVEN ONE DESIGNED TO SAVE THEIR BELOVED MASCOT? (LAUGHTER)
YOU HAVE TERRORISTS AND REBEL GROUPS CAPITALIZING ON THIS TRADE.
WE NEED VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION.
I JUST FIND IT HORRENDOUS THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS IN THE 21st CENTURY.
NAIL THESE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE HAVE JUST WITNESSED SOMETHING RARER IN NATURE THAN THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT. BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO AN ISSUE. NO--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT OF COURSE, IT MAKES SENSE. IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE. ELEPHANTS GET PRESERVED, TERRORISTS GET DENIED FUNDING, WHAT KIND OF AN ASSHOLE WOULD BE OPPOSED IT?
WE ARE FIRST DOING IS TRYING TO DEFEAT THIS IVORY BAN.
Jon: OH, AN NR ASSHOLE. OH NRA,  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WON'T TRY TO KILL THAT KEEPS OTHER THINGS FROM BEING KILLED? WHY WOULD YOU BE AGAINST SOMETHING THAT KEEPS ILLICIT MONEY OUT OF THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS?
IT IS ALSO A FIREARMS ISSUE. BUT IT'S REALLY AN ISSUE FOR ANYBODY WHO HAS IVORY.
IT'S CRAZY.
THIS INVESTMENT THAT YOU JUST INHERITED, IS WORTHLESS.
IT IS GOING TO DRIVE THE PRICE OF IVORY UP.
MAKE THE OWNERS CRIMINAL.
DESIGNED TO HURT AMERICANS.
Jon: SO I GUESS THE ONLY THINGS THAT SHOULD BE HURT HERE ARE GIANT LAND MAMMALS AND VICTIMS OF AFRICAN TERRORISM. LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT, BUNCH OF NUTS SITTING AROUND IN A STUDIO YACKING IN A RADIO, THAT CAN'T PUT A DENT ON THIS JUST AND POWERFUL BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL RESOLVE. NO LAWMAKER IS GOING TO TAKE THE BATHE.
FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY OUR GUNS, WELL, THIS REGULATION COULD ACTUALLY DO THAT. I'VE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION S2587. THE LAWFUL IVORY PROTECTION ACT OF 2014 TO STOP THIS MISGUIDED POLICY FROM GOING FORWARD.
MOTHER [BLEEP]. SEE, THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS. LIKE ELEPHANTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
