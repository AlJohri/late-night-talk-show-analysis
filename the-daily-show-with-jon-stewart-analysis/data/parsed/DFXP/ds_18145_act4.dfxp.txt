Stewart: SO WE ARE BACK  WITH ANDREW HARPER. ONE OF THE THINGS I DIDN'T  MENTION, AND HUMILITY PROBABLY  PRECLUDES YOU FROM TALKING ABOUT IT, WHEN I MET ANDREW, HE WAS,  YOU KNOW, MOVING A LITTLE  GINGERLY AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT IS UNUSUAL. HE IS A MAN OF PHYSICAL STATURE,  A YOUNG MAN, I WONDER WHY HE IS  MOVING SO GINGERLY. A MONTH BEFORE YOU WERE IN LIKE  A CRAZY DEATH CRASH IN THE  NORTHERN PART OF JORDAN NEAR THE IRAQ BORDER. HOW ARE YOU NOW?
YOU KNOW, IT WAS PRETTY TOUGH  BECAUSE ONE OF OUR KEY  COLLEAGUES WITH NEWS THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT WAS KILLED  IN THE CRASH.
Stewart: AN AWFUL  SITUATION.
YES. AND IT WAS A SITUATION WHERE WE  WERE UP ON THE BORDER CLOSE TO  IRAQ AND WE WERE ACTUALLY LITERALLY BRINGING PEOPLE ACROSS  THE BORDER AND THERE WAS, AT  THAT POINT YOU HAD PEOPLE FLEEING HOMES AND IN HAMA, THE  BOMBING AND THERE WAS I HAVE  SPOKEN TO THAT BEFORE BUT YOU HAD CHILDREN WHO LITERALLY  BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF THE  BOMBING DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GRAB ANYTHING, AND SO THEY JUST,  THE PARENTS GRABBED THEM, THE  ONES THAT ARE ALIVE, GRABBED THEM OUT OF THEIR BED, THE  CHILDREN OFTEN GRABBED THEIR  TEDDY BEARS THEY HAD CLOSEST TO THEM WHICH WAS THE MOST VALUABLE  ITEM AND THEN THEY BASICALLY  TRAVELED FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO TO GET TO THE DESERT CROSSING  AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE AND SO  WE WERE BRINGING PEOPLE ACROSS.
Stewart: IMAGINE BEING IN A  SITUATION THAT IS SO DESPERATE  THAT YOU LOOK TO IRAQ FOR  STABILITY. THEY ARE NOW TORN BY ALL TYPES  OF SECTARIAN STRIFE. YOU KNOW, FOR YOU, I MEAN, YOU  ARE IN THE WEEDS OF THIS RIGHT  NOW.  IS THERE ANY SENSE OF OPTIMISM?  ANY SENSE YOU ARE  SEEING ORDER BEING BROUGHT TO  LIFE?  WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER VICTORIES IN THIS?
WELL, THE VICTORIES ARE  WHERE, WE ARE A HUMANITARIAN  AGENCY AND WE DEAL WITH THE VICTIMS AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO  DO IS BE AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE  AND UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU SAY, OKAY, HOW IS THE OUTLOOK FOR  SYRIA?  OUR OUTLOOK IS WE WILL  BUILD ANOTHER CAMP OF 100,000 PEOPLE AND GETTING READY FOR  MORE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS  BECAUSE THERE IS NO INDICATOR OF  OPTIMISM. THERE IS NO POSITIVE SIGNAL,  THERE IS NO SENSE OF HOPE, AND  THIS IS THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO LOOK AT WHERE THE SITUATION IS  GOING IS TALKING TO THE REFUGEES  AND THE REFUGEES IN THE CAMP ARE EVEN MAKING MORE SUBSTANTIVE  HOMES, LIKE THEY ARE ACTUALLY  CHANGING THEIR TENTS INTO HOMES BECAUSE THEY PLAN TO BE THERE --
Stewart: IT IS MELANCHOLY  TRANSFORMATION WHEN THEY FIRST  GET THERE, NOBODY THINKS THEY WILL BE THERE FOR ANY LENGTH OF  TIME AND THIS IDEA OF CREATING  STABILITY. YOU KNOW, YOU TOLD ME THAT FOR  SIX MONTHS YOU COULDN'T REALLY  GO INTO THE CAMP, I MEAN, WE WENT RIGHT THROUGH IT AND PEOPLE  WERE OUT AND COMMERCE AND ALL OF  THAT BUT SIX MONTHS AGO THAT WAS NOT THE CASE, YOU WERE NOT ABLE  TO GET IN.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST TESTS IN  REGARDS TO HOW SAFE AND SECURE  THE CAMP IS IS BY CAULK WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP AND I WOULD  WALK THROUGH THE CAMP BECAUSE  YOU HAVE TO, YOU CANNOT SORT OF BE AN ALIEN TO THE REFUGEES  BECAUSE IT IS YOUR JOB TO BE  FRONT AND CENTER.
Stewart: RIGHT.
AND THAT IS HOW YOU CAN  ACTUALLY IDENTIFY MOST  VULNERABLE BECAUSE THE MOST VULNERABLE OFTEN WILL NOT COME  TO YOU, YOU HAVE TO GO AND SEE  THEM. BUT YOU ARE DEALING WITH A  POPULATION THAT IS -- HAS BEEN  BOMBED, THEY HAVE BEEN SHOT AT, THEY HAVE NO TRUST OF AUTHORITY. THEY HAVE COME ACROSS FROM --  SYRIA IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY AND  THEY HAVE COME ACROSS FROM WHAT IS A LOVELY ENVIRONMENT INTO A  DESERT AND NO MATTER WHAT WE DID  TO JATRI IT IS STILL A CAMP IN THE DESERT, IT IS A MISERABLE  PLACE AND SO THEY WERE  FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY WHICH WE WOULD BE AS WELL AND SO -- BUT  AS TIME MOVES ON AND AS THE CAMP  GOES FROM AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO SOMETHING MORE SUSTAINABLE  THEY STARTED A ADAPTING AS WELL,  AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALSO HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, NOT  EVERYTHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR  THEM.
Stewart: RIGHT.
BECAUSE THEY WILL  UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE THERE  FOR SOME TIME.
Stewart: AND YOU BRING SOME  ORDER TO IT AND TRY TO CREATE  SOME SEMBLANCE OF ADMINISTRATION, BUT I IMAGINE,  YOU KNOW, BATTLING THE BLACK  ECONOMY AND THE GRAY ECONOMY IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT  CHALLENGES.
SHOULD WE BATTLE IT AS WELL?   LIKE WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE  COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE, THIS IS GOOD,  PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO WORK AND  TRYING TO SELL THINGS IN THE  CAMP,.
Stewart: I MEAN MORE LIKE  DRUGS, WEAPONS, THINGS THAT COME  THROUGH, THE LESS SAVORY --
APART FROM THE CHICKEN.
Stewart: THE WEAPONS AND --
THERE IS A LOT OF RUMOR, A  LOT OF INNUENDO BUT WHEN IT  COMES TO PEOPLE WOULD BE MAD TO HAVE ANY WEAPONS IN THE CAMP  BECAUSE -- REFUGEES, EVEN THOUGH  THE REFUGEES HAVE TO RESPECT THE LAW AND WE WORK VERY CLOSE WITH  THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT AND  JORDANIAN AUTHORITIES TO IMPOSE THAT LAW ON THE CAMP BECAUSE IF  YOU DON'T HAVE RULES ON LAW IN  THE CATCH YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE IN SOUTHERN SYRIA THEN.
Stewart: RIGHT. I THINK ONE OF THE MOST  HEARTBREAKING SNRIETION THE  WORLD IS STANDING ABOVE, IT IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, THE  BORDER BETWEEN JORDAN AND SYRIA,  BY THE DAM, IT IS INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL AREA AND AS SOON AS IT  GOT DARK -- YOU KNOW, GUNFIRE  AND BOMBS AND IT WAS -- IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO KNOW THAT THERE  ARE PEOPLE THERE SUFFERING THOSE  --
AND IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING  LIKE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE U.N.,  IT IS NOT JUST THE U.N., IT IS ALSO THE JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT  FAKING THE LOAD OF IT AS THE  OTHER GOVERNMENTS ARE, THE JORDANIAN ARMY, THE BORDER  GUARD, FANTASTIC, THEY ARE OFTEN  PUTTING THEMSELVES BETWEEN THE REFUGEES AND THE FIRING IN ORDER  TO PROTECT THEM, AND I WAS  TALKING TO ONE BORDER GUARD THE OTHER DAY WHO WAS REFERRING TO  THAT THEY WERE HIDING THEIR GUNS  BEHIND THEIR BACK WHEN PICKING UP THE CHILDREN SO THE CHILDREN  WOULD NOT BE SCARED.
Stewart: YES.
AND THOSE, THERE ARE OTHER  SITUATIONS WHEN THE BORDER  GUARDS WOULD BE GIVING THE REFUGEES THEIR MOBILE PHONES TO  CALL THEIR RELATIVES TO LET THEM  KNOW THEY SAFELY GOT ACROSS INTO JORDAN, THESE ARE SOLDIERS.
Stewart: RIGHT.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE  RESOURCES, THEY ARE JUST DOING  IT OUT OF PURE HUMANITY AND IT IS RIGHT THING TO DO AND ONE OF  THE MOST TELLING THINGS IN  REGARDS TO JORDAN IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE UNDER FIRE AT THE  BORDER AND THE JORDANIAN  SOLDIERS WHENEVER THEY WOULD MEET A GROUP OF REFUGEES AND  BRING THEM ACROSS AND SAY YOU  ARE SAFE NOW. AND THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL IN THAT  SORT OF SITUATION AND WE WOULD  EVACUATE THE BORDER, TAKE THEM TO THE CAMP AND THEN THINGS  START TAKING PLACE.
Stewart: WOW. I CAN'T THINK YOU ENOUGH FOR  VISITING WITH US AND HOPEFULLY  GETTING THE STORY OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT WIDER AND HOPEFULLY  THINGS CONTINUE TO PROGRESS AS  BEST THEY CAN IN THAT SITUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR  SERVICE. WE APPRECIATE IT. ANDREW HARPER. UN REFUGEES.ORG.
