Jon: WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU. IN THE MIDST OF AN UGLY  ELECTION SEASON ONE MIGHT  FORGET THERE REMAINS A PLACE  WHERE DEMOCRACY REMAINS CLEAN AND COOL. MIDDLE SCHOOL. JOHN OLVER AND JASON JONES  DECIDED IT HAD TO BE  STOPPED. TONIGHT WE BRING YOU PART  TWO.
PREVIOUSLY ON THE  STRATEGIST JOHN AND JASON  EACH TOOK 1/8 GRADE  PRESIDENTIAL CAN DT AND  PROVIDED THEM WAY MODERN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. AS THE FRANTIC FIRST FEW  DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN DREW TO  A CLOSE THERE WAS SOME MINOR  ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES TO  RESOLVE.
THEY ARE COMING IN CLOSED,  POLLSTERS, MY SALARY, IT  DOES COME TO $5,105.67.
WHAT IS THE WARCHEST?
SORRY?
WARCHEST, MONEY. WHAT FUNDS HAVE WE GOT?
I DON'T HAVE ANY.
YOU HAVE NO MONEY?
NO.
DOW MIND JUST PUTTING  YOUR HANDS OVER YOUR EARS  FOR A SECOND.
SURE.
JUST REALLY TIGHT.
[BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP].
THERE WAS NO MONEY AND A  25 YEAR CAMPAIGN VETERAN  MARK O'HARA KNOWS THAT IS A  PROBLEM.
IF YOU ARE'S VERY, VERY  GOOD AT RAISING MONEY, YOU  DON'T REALLY HAVE TO BE VERY  GOOD AT ANYTHING ELSE.
AND IF YOU CAN'T RAISE  MONEY.
YOU'RE [BLEEP].
SO JASON AND LAURYN  IMMEDIATELY HIT THE PHONES  TO COLD CALL LOVED ONES AND  BLEED THEM DRY.
HELLO.
MOM, IT'S LAURYN.
HI, HON, WHAT'S UP.
WE'RE TRYING TO FUND  RAISE FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
OKAY. HOW I CAN HELP?
SO WE WERE WONDERING IF  WE COULD HAVE $1,000.
$1,000? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO USE  $1,000 FOR?
TO WIN.
NO, YOU HAD IT WRONG. YOU CAN'T BUY A CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE TO WIN ON YOUR OWN.
QUIT BEING SO NAIVE.
NAIVE? I'M TELLING-- WHO IS TELLING  TO YOU BUY A CAMPAIGN.
WE GOT TO G ALL RIGHT,  BYE.
MEANWHILE ACROSS TOWN  KYLE WAS ABOUT TO ENTERTAIN  HIS TOP DONORS AT A PRIVATE  FUND-RAISER.
OKAY, WE'VE GOT 15 OF  YOUR KEY DONORS OUT THERE. THIS IS IMPORTANT. 5.99 A PLATE, SOLD. WHAT WE LEARNED ONE.
START OFF WITH A JOKE.
GOOD. TWO.
GIVE THEM RED MEAT.
EXACTLY AND THREE DON'T  SAY [BLEEP], GO GET THEM.
THANK YOU, ALL FOR BEING  HERE. IF I GO TO ANY MORE OF THESE  FUND-RAISERS I'M GOING TO  GET FAT.
THE FUND-RAISER WAS A  HUGE SUCCESS. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A DANG  NEVER YOUR CANDIDATE  BECOMING TOO COMFORTABLE.
SO LOOK, 47% OF THE  SCHOOL IS TO THE GOING TO  VOTE FOR ME. THEY'RE LAME AND DWEE B'S  AND ADDICTED TO BEING DWEE  B'S AND I'M TO THE GOING TO  WORRY ABOUT IT.
HAVE SEEN THIS THING? 400 HITS ALREADY. IT'S BLOWING UP.
WE'RE NOT USING THAT.
PROBABLY DIDN'T MEAN  ANYTHING OF IT. I MEAN --
OKAY, OKAY. STAY POSITIVE. GIRLS, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? LOOK AT KYLE, HE'S CALLING  YOU ALL DWEE B'S.
OH MY GOD.
NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING  WORKS. AND ANYBODY IN MY INDUSTRY  WHO TELLS YOU DIFFERENT  DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] THEY'RE TALKING  ABOUT.
AND THAT'S THE NEGATIVITY  BEGAN.
OH [BLEEP], OH [BLEEP].
THE HOSTILITY WAS  THREATENING TO SPILL OVER  AND SADLY IT DID. DURING AN APPEARANCE THE  STRATEGISTS MADE ON THE  SCHOOL'S TOP RATED NEWS  PROGRAM.
