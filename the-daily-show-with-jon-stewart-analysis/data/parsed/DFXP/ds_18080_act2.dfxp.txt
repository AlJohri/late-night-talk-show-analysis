YOU MIGHT RECALL TWO WEEKS  AGO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD A  BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
WE HAVE TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE. WE CAN BE TRUE TO OUR PRINCIPLES  WITHOUT BEING DISRESPECTFUL TO  THOSE THAT DON'T AGREE WITH 100% OF THEM. AS PRESIDENT REAGAN OUR 80% IS  NOT OUR 20% ENEMY.
Jon: A 25% ENEMY, HOWEVER  THEY CAN GO (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] STILL THOUGH, KUDOS TO THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SAW THAT THEY HAD AN  OUTREACH AND AN INCLUSION  PROBLEM AND IT HAS BEEN A JESUS MOMENT OR A HAY-SUS MOMENT. THEY FIGURE WE HAVE TO REACH OUT  TO LATINOS BUT HERE IS WHAT THE  REBRANDING IS UP AGAINST. NOT TWO WEEKS AFTER THE  ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS NEW  STRATEGY THIS:
ALASKA CONGRESSMAN DON YOUNG  SEEMS TO BE IN FULL BACK PEDAL  MODE AFTER USING A SLUR TO DESCRIBE MIGRANT WORKERS. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW  TECHNOLOGY WAS EFFECTING THE  ECONOMY WHEN HE MADE THIS  COMMENT.
WE USED TO HIRE 50 TO 60  WETBACKS ON MY FATHER'S RANCH  AND PICK TOMATOES.
Jon: THEY PREFER WETBACK  AMERICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? ARE THE REPUBLICANS UNDER THE  IMPRESSION THAT YOU CAN SHOOT  THE MOON ELECTORALLY? LIKE SOMEHOW IF YOU ALIENATE  EVERY LATINO, YOU GET ALL THE  VOTES? LIKE WHAT POSSIBLE EXCUSE COULD  THIS GUY HAVE FOR WHAT HE SAID.
YOUNG TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHY HE  HAD USED THE WORD WETBACK. I USE AID TERM COMMONLY USED  DURING MY DAYS GROWING YOU ON A  FARM IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.
Jon: AND THEN I FELL ASLEEP  AND WOKE UP A COUPLE OF DAYS  AGO. [ LAUGHTER ] FROZEN IN TIME ALONG WITH MY  CORE OPINIONS AND BELIEFS. WHAT HAS CHANGED? [LAUGHTER] A BIT OF A SETBACK FOR THE  OUTREACH TO LATINOS THING. WHAT ABOUT GAY VOTES? TWO REPUBLICANS CAME OUT IN  SUPPORT OF GAY MARRIAGE THAT HAS  TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING. UNTIL BEN CARSON SPOKE.
NO GROUP BE THEY GAPES,  NAMBLA, BE THEY PEOPLE WHO  BELIEVE IN BESTIALITY THEY DON'T GET TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION.
Jon: I'M GOING TO STOP YOU  RIGHT THERE. YOU ARE A SMART MAN, A  NEUROSURGEON. YOU GET THAT ONE OF THOSE THINGS  IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER. GAY PEOPLE ARE NOT LIKE NAMBLA  OR BESTIALITY. IT'S LIKE SAYING I BELIEVE THE  LAW GRANTS THE SAME RIGHTS TO  ALL OF US WHETHER WE BE CHRISTIAN OR RAPISTS. IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH  ANYTHING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE DOCTOR'S APOLOGY, DON'T MAKE  IT NO BETTER.
I WASN'T EQUATING THE THINGS. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE EQUAL. IF YOU ASKED ME FOR AN APPLE AND  I GAVE YOU AN ORANGE, WOULD YOU  SAY IT'S NOT AN ORANGE AND I SAY HERE IS A BANANA AND HERE SAY  PEACH. THAT'S NOT AN APPLE EITHER. IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M EQUATING THE  BANANA AND THE ORANGE AND THE  PEACH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: FIRST OF ALL WHEN YOU  ARE APOLOGIZING TO GAY PEOPLE  STAY AWAY FROM FRUIT ANALOGIES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SECOND, YOU ARE EXPLANATION  DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE EITHER  WHILE APPLES AND BAN IN IN -- BANANAS ARE NOT THE EXACT SAME THING  THEY ARE ALL ALL ITEMS IN THE  SAME AISLE OF THE GROCERY STORE OR REFRIGERATOR DOOR UNLIKE GAY  PEOPLE AND PEDOPHILES AND HORSE  (bleep)S. [ LAUGHTER ] GUYS, IT'S NOT THAT HARD. TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL THIS ONE  DID IT RIGHT.
GUY HAD THIS DISCUSSION FOR  WONDERFUL CARING DEMOCRATS THIS  WEEK. THEY SAID SURELY YOU COULD AGREE  TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS IN  A MAGAZINE, COULDN'T YOU? I MEAN HOW WOULD THAT BE  PROBLEMATIC? WELL, ONCE YOU MAKE IT TEN,  THEN, WHY WOULD YOU DRAW THE  LINE AT TEN? WHAT IS WRONG WITH NINE OR  LEARN?
Jon: NOW, OKAY, OBVIOUSLY  THE ARGUMENT ITSELF IS SILLY  BUT -- DRAWING LINES AND SETTING LIMITS IT'S A JOB. IT'S WHAT YOU DO. IT'S LIKE GOING ONCE WE SET THE  VOTING AGE AT 18 WHAT IS WRONG  WITH 17 OR FIVE? YOU KNOW --
THE PROBLEM IS ONCE YOU DRAW  THAT LIMIT IT'S KIND OF LIKE  MARRIAGE WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOT A MAN AND A WOMAN ANYMORE, THEN  WHY NOT HAVE THREE MEN AND ONE  WOMAN OR FOUR WOMEN AND ONE MAN AND WHY NOT IF SOMEBODY HAS A  LOVE FOR AN ANIMAL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ASIDE FROM THE FACT  YOU ARE JUSTIFYING NOT LIMITING  ONE THING BY SHOWING THE NEED TO LIMIT ANOTHER THING WHAT IS IT  WITH YOU PEOPLE AND THE ANIMAL  (bleep). I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR MIND  GOES THERE. THEN THEY REMOVE THE LAWS OF  (bleep) ANIMALS. IS THAT THE ONLY THING HOLDING  YOU BACK BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE  A -- WOW, LOOK AT THAT GOAT. IF ONLY I WOULDN'T GET IN  TROUBLE. LIKE IT'S NOT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HITTING YOU HERE -- DIDN'T YOU  HEAR WHAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR  BOBBY JINDAL SAID THIS YEAR?
WE'VE GOT TO STOP BEING THE  STUPID PARTY.
Jon: YES, EXACTLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW THAT GUY IS AN UP AND COMER. THAT IS THE KIND OF INCLUSIVE  SMART MODERATE TONE THAT IS  GOING TO TAKE THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY INTO THE 21ST OR LATE  20th CENTURY. JINDAL HOW ARE THINGS FOR THAT  CAT?
A STATEWIDE POLL RELEASED  TODAY SHOWS GOVERNOR JINDAL'S  POPULARITY IS IN A POLITICAL TAIL SPIN.
HIS APPROVAL RATING HAS SUNK  TO 38%.
Jon:
