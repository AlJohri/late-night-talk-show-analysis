Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO EARLIER TONIGHT WE WERE TALKING WITH THE AUDIENCE A LITTLE BIT. A VERY LOVELY WOMAN FROM CANADA -- [LAUGHTER] -- MENTIONED ROB FORD TO ME. IT GOT ME THINKING IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE'VE HEARD FROM ROB FORD, THE TORONTO MAYOR WHO PUTS CRACK SMOKING IN TORONTO CRACK SMOKING MAYOR ROB FORD. SO, WHAT HAS HE BEEN UP TO LATELY? WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM. BUT, BEFORE WE FIND OUT, ALLOW ME TO JUST TAKE A HEALTHY DRINK OF WATER WHILE I FIND OUT WHAT IS UP WITH ROB FORD.
TROUBLED TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD BACK IN THE NEWS AGAIN.
ANOTHER VIDEO ALLEGEDLY SHOWING FORD SMOKING CRACK COCAINE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED I DIDN'T SPIT OUT MY WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS FAR AS ANNOUNCEMENTS GO IT'S NOT VERY SURPRISING. PERHAPS I'LL FINISH THE WHOLE CUP.
ON WEDNESDAY TORONTO'S MAYORAL CAMPAIGN WAS BROUGHT TO A STAND STILL WHEN ROB FORD ANNOUNCED HE WAS ENTERING REHAB.
Jon: WHAT? [LAUGHTER] OH, MY -- YES! YES! THAT IS A SURPRISE. A WONDERFUL SURPRISE. IN FACT ROB FORD GOING TO REHAB NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST OF THINGS I THOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. I THOUGHT MAYBE BABY PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO TELL ME, VERY QUICKLY, WHO WAS THE CITIZEN JOURNALIST WHO BROUGHT THESE LATEST REVELATIONS TO LIGHT?
THE VIDEO HAD BEEN SHOT BY A DRUG DEALER WHO WAS ATTEMPTING TO SELL IT FOR AT LEAST SIX FIGURES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: EITHER THAT DRUG DEALER IS A KEEBLER ELF OR SMOKING CRACK MAKES ROB FORD NINE FEET TALL. BY THE WAY, SIX FIGURES FOR THE VIDEO OF THE CRACK MAYOR SMOKING CRACK? KIND OF SURPRISED I HAVE TO SAY THIS TO A DRUG DEALER BUT LET ME EXPLAIN SUPPLY AND DEMAND TO YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF AN ITEM LIKE BANANAS OR SOCKS OR VIDEOS OF ROB FORD SMOKING CRACK. PRICE TENDS TO DROP. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SIX FIGURES, YOU WANT A VIDEO OF SOMETHING RARE. JUSTIN BIEBER STOPPING A BRATTY KID FROM BEING A PUBLIC NUISANCE OR A PANDA GANG BANG KNOWN IN THE BUSINESS AS PANG PANG. I'M NOT SURE WHAT BUSINESS THAT IS BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S KNOWN AS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHAT MAKES THIS VIDEO EVEN LESS VALUABLE. IT'S NOT EVEN THE CRAZIEST THING THAT ROB FORD GOT CAUGHT DOING THIS WEEK.
ANOTHER TORONTO PAPER RELEASED AN AUDIO TAPE RECORDED AT A BAR ON MONDAY. FORD WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN DRUNK COULD BE HEARD MAKING OFFENSIVE COMMENTS ABOUT A FEMALE POLITICAL RIVAL. I'D LIKE TO (bleep) JAM HER, BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT. I CAN'T TALK LIKE THIS. I'M SO SORRY. I FORGOT THERE'S A WOMAN IN THE HOUSE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HERE IS WHAT IS AMAZING. EVEN DRUNK, EVEN ON CRACK, HE IS SO (bleep) CANADIAN. [LAUGHTER] I'M GOING TO JAM -- SORRY MY LADY. PARDON MY COARSE LANGUAGE AND VULGAR ARTICULATION, I MERELY MEANT TO SAY I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY PENIS TWIXT HER VOIGE REGION. [ LAUGHTER ] SURELY AFTER THIS PIECE OF UNMAYORAL LIKE BEHAVIOR ON TOP OF THE ALCOHOLISM AND THE CRACK ADDICTION AND THE MAKING OF HIS CITY INTO A MOCKERY OF GLOBAL SCALE ROB FORD HAS TO ADMIT HIS POLITICAL REAR IS DONE.
FORD'S ATTORNEY SAYS HE PLANS TO STAY IN THE MAYORAL RACE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT ALL JOKING ASIDE -- [  APPLAUSE  ] -- NO I THINK IT'S GOOD HE IS TAKING SOME TIME TO GET THE HELP HE SO CLEARLY NEEDS. AND HOPEFULLY FOR TORONTO THEY'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE A MORE COMPETENT MAYOR. I BELIEVE THE DEPUTY MAYOR TAKES OVER FOR HIM. I BELIEVE THAT'S, HER NAME IS, OH IT'S RHUBARB LADY.
YOU PINOCCHIO (bleep) NOSE. GO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. WHERE'S YOUR (bleep) NAME ON THIS ALLEY PROPERTY (bleep)?
WHERE'S YOURS?
Jon: SO, THAT SHOULD BE GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
