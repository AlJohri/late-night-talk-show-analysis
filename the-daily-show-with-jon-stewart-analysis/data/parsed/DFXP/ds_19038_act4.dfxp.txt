[  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: WE'RE BACK. CIVILIAN WARRIORS IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. YOU MENTIONED YOU ARE IN THERE, YOU WORK FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND THEN YOU MOVE ON. ISN'T THAT ALSO PART OF THE ISSUE WITH RELYING LARGE SCALE ON THESE TYPES OF MORE MERCENARY FORCES IS THAT FOR INSTANCE YOU ARE NOW DOING BUSINESS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS?
ALL THAT ACTIVITIES LICENSED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
Jon: UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT IS NOT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND SO THE GOALS AND DIRECTIVES THAT YOU WILL BE WORKING UNDER MAYHAT DIVERGE FROM NECESSARILY THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES?
ALL THOSE FOREIGN ACTIVITIES WOULD BE LICENSED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT THE U.S. POLICY IS.
Jon: YOU YOURSELF SAID THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION BETWEEN DOD, STATE, C.I.A. EVEN THE C.I.A. CASE THEY HIRE YOU WORK ON THEIR ASSASSIN PROGRAM. WHAT IS CODE NAME? CODE NAME?
READ THE LAST CHAPTER OF THE BOOK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: RIGHT NOW? [LAUGHTER]
NO.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WHAT'S THE NAME OF PROGRAM THEY HIRED YOU TO DO THE ASSASSINATION PROGRAM?
THERE'S A NUMBER OF COVERT ACTION PROGRAMS THAT THE COMPANY OR I SIGNED UP FOR IN OUR PROCESS OF SERVING THE COUNTRY.
Jon: OKAY SO I'M GOING TO GO WITH OPERATION EAGLE TALON, HOW ABOUT THAT?
SURE.
Jon: THEY SIGN YOU UP FOR THIS. IF THERE'S CONFUSION, WE DON'T KNOW WHO HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE C.I.A. THE IDEA THAT THE C.I.A. HAS SUBCONTRACTED TO YOU GUYS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY MIGHT THINK WHAT SORT OF DARK POOL HAVE WE ENTERED?
FROM THE START OF INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WHEN BILL DONOVAN STARTED IT AS THE OSS IN WORLD WAR II HE RECRUITED CIVILIANS THAT HAD ACCESS OR KNOW-HOW OR SKILLS TO HELP THEIR COUNTRY THAT PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED SINCE THE BEGINNING. IT'S ONE OF MAJOR SOURCES OF COLLECTION FOR AMERICA. YOU NEVER WANT TO GET RID OF THAT CAPABILITY FOR AMERICANS TO.
Jon: IS IT A QUESTION OF DEGREE? HAVE WE GONE TOO FAR IN THAT DIRECTION? DID YOU GUYS GET TOO BIG? I KNOW A LOT OF THESE SEALS -- THESE ARE SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE. IT'S UPSETTING TO MEET PEOPLE THAT SMART, THAT PHYSICALLY CAPABLE AND THAT BRAVE -- I DON'T LIKE IT. SOME ARE VERY FUNNY AND IT'S REALLY ANNOYING. AND IF I WERE THAT, I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE, I TOO, WOULD BE KICKING ASS AND TAKING NAMES. THAT BEING SAID, DON'T WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO CREATE TOO LARGE A RELIANCE ON THAT? YOU STARTED OUT AS A WAY TO TRAIN POLICE FORCES AND OTHER THINGS. THE WAR ON TERROR HITS, YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND SUDDENLY YOU BECOME THIS INCREDIBLY INTEGRAL AND RATHER LARGE PART OF THE WAR ON TERROR?
IT'S A MISNOMER IN TERMS OF HOW LARGE WE ARE. WE WERE TINY COMPARED TO THE LOCKHEEDS, GRUMMAN --
Jon: YOU ARE NOT DEALING IN WEAPONRY. YOU'RE DEALING IN IN HUMAN CAPITAL. AS A FIGHTING FORCE IT WAS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY?
WE HAD A LOT OF CAPABILITY. OUR OWN AIRCRAFT, 73 AIRCRAFT WE DEPLOYED FOR THE U.S.
I WROTE THE BOOK AS A WARNINGROTE THE BOOK AS A SIGN AS THE NEXT ENTREPRENEUR THAT SAID YES I'LL ANSWER THE CALL BECAUSE THE HOT AIR IN WASHINGTON CAN TURN INTO A BLAST FURNACE. TO YOU HAVE A TORTURE BUSINESS --
Jon: YOU FEEL YOU GOT BURNED BY THE WASHINGTON ELITE. YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE HIRED TO DO, YOU DID IT HONORABLY.
AFTER NASSAR SQUARE AND THE RAGE AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR FELL ON THE CONTRACTORS AND WE WERE KIND OF THE -- AN EASY TARGET FOR THEM.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN? I MEAN THAT'S -- YOU KNOW YOU ARE A SOPHISTICATED GUY, YOU UNDERSTAND THE MEDIA CLIMATE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN A WAR ZONE, IN A WAR THEATER THINGS LIKE THIS MORE THAN LIKELY ARE GOING TO HAPPEN?
WE CERTAINLY KNEW THAT BAD THINGS WOULD HAPPEN. WE FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON PROTECTING THE CUSTOMERS FROM THE ENEMY OR PREPARING THEM TO FACE THE ENEMY OR SUPPLYING TROOPS IN TIMES OF NEED. I GUESS WE DIDN'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE FLANKS BEING THE --
Jon: I FIND THIS INTERESTING YOU FEEL SOMEWHAT BETRAYED?
UM, WHEN THE IRS AGENT COMES TO YOUR ACCOUNTANT AND SAYS I'VE NEVER BEEN UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE TO GET SOMEONE AS TO GET ERIK PRINCE.
Jon: THAT COULD BE BULL -- THEY GOT YOU?
PROCTOLOGY EXAM AFTER PROCTOLOGY EXAM.
Jon: WHEN I GOT THAT EXAM I REMEMBER THE DOCTOR SAYING TO ME I NEVER WANTED TO GET ANYBODY MORE THAN I WANTED TO GET ERIK PRINCE. I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF THAT'S WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU FEEL THAT THE GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY TURNED AGAINST YOU AND BEGAN TO PERSECUTE YOU IN SOME WAY?
INDEED. MEETING WITH CONGRESSIONAL STAFFS, THE INVESTIGATORS THEY SAY LOOK IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO, WE'RE GOING TO RIDE YOU UNTIL YOU ARE OUT OF BUSINESS.
Jon: THAT'S TROUBLING.
YEAH.
Jon: AND SO THE MORAL OF THE STORY FOR YOU IS -- BECAUSE YOU ARE STILL IN BUSINESS, YES?
NOT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING BUSINESS.
Jon: YOU DON'T WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ANYMORE?  I SOLD THE WHOLE THING WE'RE DONE.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU DO?
WE STARTED A COMPANY THAT INVESTS IN MINING --
Jon: THERE'S A KID UP THERE A TRADER. DO YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THIS GUY? WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED  ARAB EMIRATES, THE THE SOMALI PIRATES?
I'M ALL DONE. IT'S CALLED FRONTIER BUSINESS GROUP.
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. THIS IS A FASCINATING COUNTER POINT TO WHAT HAS BEEN, I THINK LIKE IN MOST THINGS THERE'S A SQUIRRELY TRUTH THAT LIES SOMEWHERE IN THERE  -- BUT, YOU KNOW YOU CLEARLY FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN PUT THROUGH A VERY DIFFICULT AND TUMULTUOUS.
LET ME ALSO BE CLEAR, WHATEVER NONSENSE WE'VE BEEN PUT THROUGH, THE GUYS WHO LOST LIMBS, LOST THEIR LIVES THEY PAY A VASTLY HIGHER PRICE. INFINITELY HIGHER PRICE. I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE I'M COMPLAINING.
Jon: I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE DIMINISHING THEIR SACRIFICE OR LOSS. I'M CURIOUS, THE GUYS THAT YOU EMPLOYED WHO WERE EXVETERANS WHO WENT TO WORK IN IRAQ, WERE THEY -- DID THEY FEEL BETRAYED? THIS COUNTRY HAS A GREAT DEAL OF PRIDE IN THE MILITARY FORCE, DO YOU FEEL THAT THE CONTRACTORS DIDN'T GET ANY OF EVEN THE REFLECTED GLORY FROM THAT AND DO THEY FEEL BETRAYED BY THAT?
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY FEEL BETRAYED. THEY DIDN'T DO IT FOR PRAISE. I DON'T THINK YOU SERVE YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU EXPECTED TO BE PRAISED. YOU DO IT FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FOR THE MISSION. OUR PEOPLE WERE VERY PROUD OF THE MISSION THEY ACCOMPLISHED. ON THE BACK COVER OF BOOK THERE'S A METAL THAT WE GAVE TO SOME OF OUR GUYS. IF THEY WERE WOUNDED OR PERFORMED WITH GREAT VALOR.
Jon: YOU GIVE AN ACTUAL MEDAL BECAUSE THERE'S --
GOLD PLATED SILVER OR SOLID GOLD.
Jon: LOOK AT THAT I'M DONE KEEPING QUIET. IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING STORY, MAN, AND I FEEL SOMEWHAT SAD THAT IT HAS COME TO, FOR YOU, THAT FEELING OF BETRAYAL BECAUSE --
AN EXPENSIVE LESSON BUT MOVE ON AND ON TO CHAPTER 2.
Jon: THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY. CIVILIAN WARRIORS IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, ERIK PRINCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
