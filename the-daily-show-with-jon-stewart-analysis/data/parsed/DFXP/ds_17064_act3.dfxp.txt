Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ASTROPHYSICIST AND A DIRECT RT DIRECTOR OF THE PLANETARIUM. HIS BOOK IS CALLED SPACE CHRONICLES. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  VERY EXCITED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
OH, MY GOSH.
Jon: SPACE CHRONICLES. DO YOU DO THAT AT HOME?
NO, NO, NO. PLUS MY VOICE IS DEEPER THAN YOURS. SO SPACE CHRONICLES. THE PLANETARIUM VOICE COMES OUT DEEP.
Jon: YOU DO ALL THE NARRATIONS?
NO, NO, NO WE HAVE LIKE A- LIST MOVIE STARS COME IN AND DO IT. I MIGHT DO THE NEXT ONE. WE HAVE PEEPS.
Jon: PEOPLE THAT ARE WELL KNOWN.
IN FACT,....
Jon: PEOPLE THAT LIVE NEARBY.
(LAUGHING IN A FUNNY WAY) I'LL MAKE A NOTE.
Jon: TELL ME ABOUT THIS. SPACE CHRONICLES. THE BASIC PREMISE OF THIS IS WE NO LONGER PRIORITIZE SPACE EXPLORATION. YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A TRAGIC MISSTEP.
YES.
Jon: FOR OUR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
YES. TRAGIC MISSTEP.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR COMING BY. EXCELLENT WORK. THE BOOK IS CALLED SPACE CHRONICLES.
(LAUGHING).
Jon: WHAT IS IT THAT....
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. IN THE 1960s WE WERE AT WAR WITH THE SOVIET UNION. THE COLD WAR. A LITTLE BIT OF HOT WAR OVER IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. SO WE FEARED THEM BECAUSE THEY PUT UP SPUTNIK WHICH BY THE WAY PEOPLE FORGET WAS AN  EMPTIED OUT CASING OF AN INTER-CONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE.
Jon: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE FORGOT THAT. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNEW THAT.
OKAY. SO, SO, SO THEY PUT A LITTLE DEVICE THAT GOES BEEP, BEEP. AND SPUTNIK ITSELF MEANS FELLOW TRAVELER. IT'S ALL PEACEFUL BUT IT WAS A BALLISTIC MISSILE HEAD WITHOUT EXPLOSIVES. THAT WAS A SIGNAL. WE FREAKED IN AMERICA. NASA GOT FOUNDED. ON THE FEAR FACTOR OF SPUTNIK. ALL RIGHT. SO WE THEN GO TO THE MOON ON THE FEAR FACTOR THAT RUSSIA WILL CONTROL HIGH GROUND. THEN WE GO TO THE MOON, SPACE ENTHUSIASTS SAY, OH, WE'RE ON THE MOON BY '69. WE'LL BE ON MARS IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS. THEY COMPLETELY DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE GOT TO THE MOON IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE WERE AT WAR. ONCE WE SAW THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT READY TO LAND ON THE MOON, WE STOPPED GOING TO THE MOON. THAT SHOULD NOT SURPRISE ANYBODY LOOKING BACK ON IT. MEANWHILE, HOWEVER, THAT ENTIRE ERA GALVANIZED THE NATION. FORGET THE WAR. IT GALVANIZED US ALL TO DREAM ABOUT TOMORROW, TO THINK ABOUT THE HOMES OF TOMORROW, CITIES  OF TOMORROW, THE FOOD OF TOMORROW. EVERYTHING WAS FUTURE WORLD. FUTURE LAND. THE WORLD'S FAIR, ALL OF THIS WAS FOCUSED ON ENABLING PEOPLE TO MAKE TOMORROW COME. THAT WAS A CULTURAL MIND SET THAT THE SPACE PROGRAM BROUGHT UPON US. WE REAPED THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE YOU HAD PEOPLE WANTING TO BECOME  SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ENABLED TOMORROW TO EXIST TODAY. AND SO IT IS THAT MINE SET....
Jon: YOU'RE (BEEP) WALT DISNEY. LISTEN TO YOU. YOU ARE INSPIRING ME. I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND FIX MYSELF A GLASS OF TANG. I'M EXCITED NOW.
SO TODAY, OKAY, I'D RATHER WAR NOT BE THE DRIVER.
Jon: WELL, LET IT BE THE DRIVER.
IT COULD HAPPEN. CHINA WANTS TO PUT A MILITARY BASE ON THE MOON WE'RE THERE IN TWO YEARS.
Jon: I HEARD AL QAEDA IS GOING TO MARS.
THIS COULD WORK EASY IN THE MARKETING.
Jon: YOU BROUGHT UP SOMETHING EARLIER THAT I THOUGHT WAS FASCINATING, THAT  THE PROGRESS WAS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR US. WAS ITS THAT THE EXPECTATION BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IN FILMS AND POPULAR CULTURE IS  THAT WE WOULD LAND ON THE MOON AND THEN WE DISCOVER PEOPLE. THEN THEY WOULD WANT TO PHONE HOME AND BY NOT FINDING THESE THINGS, THE WORK THAT WE'RE  DOING IS TOO ESOTERIC AND ABSTRACT FOR THE AMERICANS TO GET BEHIND.
NO, NO,.
Jon: THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
IT'S NOT ABOUT ESOTERIC. IT'S ABOUT NO LONGER....
Jon: WE THINK IT'S ESOTERIC.
IT'S ABOUT WE NO LONGER ADVANCED A SPACE FRONTIER. THE WHOLE SHUTTLE PROGRAM MADE THE SPACE STATION. SPACE SHUTTLE BOLDLY WENT WHERE HUNDREDS HAD GONE BEFORE. THAT IS NOT WHAT NEWSPAPERS RIGHT ABOUT AS ADVANCING A FRONTIER.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
I SUBMIT TO YOU IF WE DOUBLE NASA'S BUDGET....
Jon: WHAT? I'M SORRY. YOU'RE MADLOCK.
YEAH. I ALERT YOU OF THE FACT THAT....
Jon: THANK YOU.
...THAT IF YOU DOUBLE NASA'S BUDGET. RIGHT NOW IT'S A HALF A PENNY ON A DOLLAR. MAKE IT A PENNY. GO AHEAD MAKE IT PENNY. BE BOLD.
Jon: FINE.
THE PENNY ON THE DOLLAR, THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GO TO MARS SOON WITH PEOPLE AND GO BACK TO THE MOON AND ON TO ASTROID. NOT ONLY DOES THAT STOKE THE AMBITIONS OF KIDS IN THE PIPELINE, IT SHIFTS THE MIND  SETS OF A NATION THAT ENABLE US ALL TO NOW SAY, HEY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ENABLES THESE DISCOVER EASE. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST OR TECHNOLOGIST, YOU WILL VALUE THAT ACTIVITY.
Jon: WE'LL BE INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE.
YES. THAT IN THE 21st CENTURY ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF TOMORROW'S ECONOMIES. WITHOUT IT, WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST SLIDE BACK TO THE CAVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE  HEADED RIGHT NOW, BROKE.
Jon: CAN I SAY SOMETHING? NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, 2012. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT WAS INSPIRING.
QUICK. AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR PROGRAM, YOUR EARTH IS SPINNING THE WRONG DIRECTION.
Jon: SON OF A BITCH.
I'M SORRY. I HAD TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SPACE CHRONICLES ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
