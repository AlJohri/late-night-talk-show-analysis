Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. JOIN US NEXT WEEK AT 11:00. BY THE WAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF COMING DOWN AND SEEING THE SHOW LIVE IN  NEW YORK? STAND AROUND ALL DAY IN A -- WHAT IS CLEARLY A GOD FORSAKEN PART OF NEW YORK CITY WHERE AT  ANY MOMENT A PACK OF FERAL DOGS MAY DRAG AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS YOU MET UP WITH ON FOURSQUARE  INTO AN ALLEY AND TEAR THEM TO PIECES. WHAT IS IN IT FOR ME? PERHAPS SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IF YOU COME TO THE SHOW YOU MAY GET A FREE DVD COPY OF WAITE WYATT  CENAC COMEDY PERSON. YOU CAN BUY IT. SO COME ON DOWN. THAT'S WHAT THE AUDIENCE GOT TONIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO THAT? YOU KNOW WHY I'M DOING IT? I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M DOING IT BECAUSE WHEN OPRAH LEFT TV, SOMEBODY HAD TO FILL THE HOLE. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT ZEN.
