[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A UNITED STATES SENATOR REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED A FIGHTING CHANCE, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. SENATOR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE. BOOK IS CALLED "A FIGHTING CHANCE." BOSTON IS IN FACT STRONG. BEFORE WE GET STARTED OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE A LADY SENATOR SO I'M JUST GOING TO PUT THIS OUT HERE. [ Laughter ]
ALL RIGHT. THERE'S THAT ANGER WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. DO YOU FEEL THAT IN WASHINGTON? DO YOU FEEL THAT WOMEN ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY, EITHER BY THE MEDIA OR BY YOUR COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THE SENSE WE GET FROM WATCHING THESE SHOWS, FOR INSTANCE CHELSEA CLINTON'S GRANDCHILD BEING A FACTOR IN HILLARY CLINTON'S CAREER, OR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.
YES.
THAT DOES EXIST?
YEP.
BECAUSE WE SEEM TO HAVE THE TAPES THAT PROVE IT DOES EXIST.
UH-HUH.
DO YOU ACTIVELY BATTLE IT OR IGNORE IT?
THAT IS, WHEN YOU IGNORE IT, YOU ARE ACTIVELY BATTLING IT. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO. YOU TRY TO GET TO THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER. TO GET TO THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO YOU, TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR VOICE GETS HEARD ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO SENT YOU TO WASHINGTON TO WORK FOR THEM. SO YEAH, IT'S A FIGHT BUT IT'S THE RIGHT FIGHT AND YOU JUST GOT TO HAVE IT.
WHEN YOU CAME HERE THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE A PROFESSOR, YOU WERE AN ACTIVIST. THE SECOND TIMED YOU CAME HERE YOU WERE A CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR, THE THIRD TIME YOU WERE A SENATOR. I GUESS IN THOSE THREE ITERATIONS WHO HAS THE NICEST BATHROOMS, HARVARD OR THE SENATE?
UH YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY THIS IS A COOL STORY ABOUT THE SENATE. THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MANY WOMEN SENATORS. SO FOR THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIME WE NOW HAVE 20 WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NICE.
ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE CAN HOLD THAT APPLAUSE FOR WHEN WE CAN SAY, WE HAVE AT LEAST 50 WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THAT'S WHEN WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
BUT THERE WAS JUST ONE TINY LITTLE WOMEN'S BATHROOM. SO YOU HAD TO KIND OF --
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I'M DEAD SERIOUS. AND YOU KIND OF HAD TO SCOOCH SIDEWAYS AND SEE WHO WAS IN THERE. I NEVER SAW THE MEN'S ROOM BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE COMING IN AND OUT OKAY. SO ACTUALLY THEY HAD TO MAKE A CHANGE. THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS CHANGING. WE NOW HAVE A BIGGER LADIES ROOM.
CONGRATULATIONS! [APPLAUSE]
I CAN JUST IMAGINE THAT COMING TO THE FLOOR AND THE REPUBLICANS FILIBUSTERING UNTIL THEY HAD TO USE IT. [ Laughter ]
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT WHERE YOU HAVE FOUND THE DIFFERENCE, SO LOOK, BEING IN THE SENATE VERSUS FIGHTING FROM THE OUTSIDE, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO FIGHT FROM WITHIN AN INSTITUTION THAT TO MANY OBSERVERS IS CORRUPTED BY MONEY, IDEOLOGY AND THE OTHER TYPES OF DOGMA THAT SLOW THINGS DOWN. HAVE YOU FOUND THAT A FRUSTRATION?
SO LOOK, THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME NOW IS WASHINGTON WORKS FOR THOSE WHO CAN HIRE ARMIES OF LOBBYISTS AND LAWYERS. IF YOU ARE A HUGE CORPORATION IF YOU ARE A BILLIONAIRE, BOY YOUR VOICE GETS HEARD IN THAT PLACE. AND WHAT YOU WANT GETS ATTENDED TO. FOR ORDINARY FAMILIES IT JUST DOESN'T WORK SO WELL. SO IT'S REALLY THE SAME KIND OF FIGHT. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF FIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. RIGHT NOW, WHERE WE ARE. KIDS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE, THEIR PARENTS CAN'T AFFORD TO WRITE THEM A CHECK SO THEY HAVE TO BORROW MONEY. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SAYS WE WILL LEND YOU THE MONEY TO GO TO SCHOOL. OK, THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO. AND THEN PILES ONTO THE INTEREST RATES SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAKES TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT OFF THE BACKS OF KIDS TRYINT TO GET AN EDUCATION. I THINK IT'S OBSCENE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE PROFITS. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: SO, HOW IS THAT LEGAL?  YOU KNOW, BUT THAT DOESN'T STRIKE ME. SO WHO IS LOBBYING THE GOVERNMENT TO GET, THAT ISN'T EVEN A CORPORATE INTEREST, THAT IS A GOVERNMENT INHERENT INTERNAL CORRUPTION IS IT NOT?
THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. SO TO SAY, WHICH I WANT TO DO AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO PROPOSE NEXT MONTH, REFINANCING THOSE STUDENT LOANS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING, TO BRING DOWN THE INTEREST RATE, CUT THE INTEREST RATE ON THOSE STUDENT LOANS. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO FIND SOME PLACE ELSE IN THE BUDGET TO FIND THAT MONEY. MY VIEW IS WE OUGHT TO CLOSE A COUPLE OF THOSE LOOPHOLES, MAKE BILLIONAIRES  PAY JUST AS MUCH IN TAXES AS THEIR SECRETARIES DO. BUT THE LOBBYISTS WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
SURE, SURE. BUT HERE'S WHAT'S FRUSTRATING. I GET THAT. SO THE FED, THE FED HAS AN OPEN WINDOW, A DISCOUNT WINDOW WHERE THESE BANKS CAN COME IN AND BORROW AT ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, THEY CAN GRAB MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND TURN IT AROUND AND TURN IT INTO TREASURIES OR WHATEVER IT IS AND MAKE 3 OR 4% AND TURN IT AROUND AND SO YOU'RE TELLING ME KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GO TO COLLEGE HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON LOANS BUT THESE BANKS WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CAN COME IN AND BORROW AT ZERO INTEREST AND USE IT AS A MONEY PRINTING MACHINE --
AND THAT'S HOW THE GAME IS RIGGED.  ALL RIGHT, WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT HOW THE REAL WORLD OF POLITICS INTERACTS WITH THE IDEALS OF POLITICS.
MORE WITH SENATOR WARREN WHEN WE COME BACK.
