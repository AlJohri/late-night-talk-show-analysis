[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR. NEW FILM IS "THE IMITATION GAME."
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?
PLAY?
IT'S A GAME. A TEST OF SORTS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMETHING IS A MACHINE OR A HUMAN BEING.
HOW DO I PLAY?
WELL THERE'S A JUDGE AND A SUBJECT. THE JUDGE ASKS QUESTIONS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SUBJECT'S ANSWERS DETERMINES WHO HE IS TALKING WITH OR WHAT HE IS TALKING WITH. AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK ME A QUESTION.
Jon: IT'S AN AWESOME MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD EVENING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
HELLO.
Jon: YOU GET A LOT OF THAT, DON'T YOU?
WHAT THE LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE ATMOSPHERE WITH THE --
Jon: THE SHREAKING, THE JUMPING, THE CLAPPING.
UH, UH -- YEAH. YEAH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
IT DOESN'T EVER NORMALIZE, I TELL YOU THAT. IT'S WONDERFUL BUT VERY STRANGE.
Jon: BUT THERE REALLY IS, THERE'S SOMETHING. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I HAVE A LOST GUESTS ON THE SHOW. I HAVE A LOT OF HIGH PROFILE, WE HAVE PRESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES, SITTING HEADS OF STATE.
YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO.
Jon:  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. YOU'RE THE FIRST GUEST, I WANT TO RIP YOUR CLOTHES AND SELL THEM ON E-BAY. I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT'S UPSETTING FOR ME.
MAYBE WE CAN COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT.
Jon: I THINK THAT WOULD BE -- I FEEL LIKE IF YOU WERE TO GO ON THE INTERNET AND OIL UP YOUR BACKSIDE AND BARED IT IN A KARDASHIAN LIKE POSE THIS PLANET COULD END. [LAUGHING]  THAT'S HOW I FEEL.
SATELLITES WILL CRASH.
Jon: SATELLITES WILL CRASH INTO THE THING.
YEAH.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU FEELING? THIS PERFORMANCE IS REMARKABLE. AND WE SAW A LITTLE SOMETHING IN THE CLIP I WANT TO POINT OUT. SO ALAN TURING, WHO IS THE SCIENTIST, WELL EXPLAIN QUICKLY WHAT IT IS AND THEN I WILL GET TO THE POINT, THE FILM.
THE FILM, THE FILM IS CALLED "THE IMITATION GAME" IT'S ABOUT ALAN TURING AND THE TEAM OF SCIENTISTS WHO CRACK THE GERMAN ENIGMA CODE, WHICH POSSIBLY BROUGHT ABOUT A 2-YEAR EARLY END TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR THEREBY SAVING 14 MILLION LIVES. AND YOU'RE SORT OF, YOU'RE INTRODUCED TO THIS CHARACTER AND HE'S VERY DIFFERENT, DIFFICULT, UNCOMPROMISING.
Jon: YES. YES.
THERE'S NO VANITY ABOUT HIM. HE'S FUNNY, BOTH INTENTIONALLY, AND UNINTENTIONALLY. AND SLOWLY, AS THE MYSTERY GETS CRACKED YOU ALSO CRACK THE CODE OF WHO THIS MAN IS.
Jon: EXACTLY.
YOU SEE BACK INTO HIS PAST AND UNDERSTAND HIM.
Jon: HE COULD OF SAVED 14 MILLION LIVES. AND THEY REPAY HIM AFTER THE WAR WITH --
STATE SANCTION AND CHEMICAL CASTRATION.
Jon: STATE SANCTION AND CHEMICAL CASTRATION. YES, THT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT HE WAS GAY. AND THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. AND IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE. REMARKABLE STORY.
YES. AND COMPLETELY TRUE STORY. AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I WANTED TO TELL IT WAS BECAUSE OF HOW ANGRY I WAS NOT JUST AT THE INJUSTICE HE WAS SERVED BUT HOW RELATIVE TO THE SCALE OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS. THIS MAN -- AND NOT ONLY IN OUR FILM DOES HE HELP THE EFFORT THAT WON US THE WAR.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THAT MARKS ME, OR MARKS HIM RATHER AS A WAR HERO FOR ME. AND BEFORE THAT HE WAS BASICALLY THE FATHER OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE MODERN COMPUTER SCIENCE.
Jon: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CLIP, THE TURING TEST WHERE YOU DECIDE WHETHER SOMETHING IS HUMAN OR WHETHER SOMETHING IS A MACHINE.
CORRECT. WELL THAT WAS WORK HE DID AFTER THE WAR.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT WAS WORK HE DID ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. SO THE IMITATION GAME IS ANOTHER PHRASE FOR THE TURING TEST WHICH HE SORT OF WENT INTO THIS INCREDIBLE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION THAT STILL HAUNTS US OUTSIDE OF THE SCIENCES.
Jon: AND WE STILL CAN'T CRACK IT. WE STILL CAN'T CRACK.
WELL NO, IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES US HUMAN? WHAT IS IT IN OUR INTELLIGENCE THAT IS OURS AND OURS ALONE.
IF YOU FABRICATE SOMETHING THAT REPLICATES THAT, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
Jon: RIGHT.
JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS MADE DIFFERENTLY DOESN'T MEAN  AND THINKING DIFFERENTLY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THINKING, SO --
Jon: RIGHT. I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE WRONG TIME TO ASK YOU TO MARRY ME.  [LAUGHING]
YOU'RE A BIT LATE. Jon: CAUSE JUST AS YOU WERE TALKING I WAS LIKE MAN, HE'S REALLY SMART TOO. NOW THIS WHOLE THING IS STARTING TO GET UPSETTING. BUT IN THE FILM -- HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AND THIS IS, IT'S , IT'S GONNA SEEM LIKE SMALL BALL. BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE PREPARATION YOU PUT IN AND THE TYPE OF PERFORMANCE THAT THIS IS. SO ALAN TURING HAD A BIT OF A STUTTER. AND WHEN YOU WATCH SOMEONE PERFORM IN A FILM, AN ACTOR DO A STUTTER, IT'S ALWAYS ON A CONSONANT.  YOU DO SOMETHING IN THE FILM THAT IS UTTERLY, IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S ON THE VOWEL OR YOU FIND A WAY TO DO IT WHERE IT, AND IT BRINGS AN AUTHENTICITY TO IT. AND IS THAT FROM HIS SPEECH PATTERN OR SOMETHING YOU WERE ABLE TO KIND OF CONJURE?
WELL, THERE IS NO AUDIO RECORDING OF HIM. THERE IS NO VIDEO FOOTAGE OF HIM. BUT THERE IS EXTENSIVE ANECDOTAL DESCRIPTION OF HOW HE DID STAMMER AND IT WAS PRETTY MAJOR. IN THE FILM IT GETS WORSE WHEN HE'S UNDER PRESSURE. WHEN THERE'S EITHER AN EMOTIONAL OR PHYSICAL PRESSURE ON HIM TO STOP THE WORK AT BLETCHLEY PARK, WHICH PEOPLE TRIED TO SHUT DOWN AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THE FILM.  WHEN HE'S UNDER PRESSURE NEAR THE END OF THE FILM WHEN HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANIC ATTACK BASICALLY BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF THE ESTROGEN INJECTIONS. BUT IN LIFE IT WAS ALMOST A SENTENCE BY SENTENCE OCCURRENCE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ARTISTIC LICENSE WITH CONDENSING THAT TO THE MOMENTS WE DO USE IT IN THE FILM --
Jon: AND YOU WERE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT NECESSARILY GIVING AWAY CHEATS OR PATTERNING. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S SORT OF REMARKABLE ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
I GUESS YOU SORT OF EMBODY IT AND YOU PLAY IT THROUGH. IT'S REALLY, IT'S QUITE LOVELY. I WISH YOU WERE AT LEAST LESS TALENTED. I WISH YOU WOULD JUST LEAN OVER AND BE LIKE "I HAVE EIGHT NIPPLES" LIKE SOMETHING TO HELP ME GET OVER THIS CAT. "THE IMITATION GAME" BY THE WAY, IN THEATERS NOVEMBER 28th. YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE A GREAT THING, IS MAYBE TAKE IN A DOUBLE FEATURE WITH ANOTHER FILM THAT'S ALSO MAYBE PLAYING --
ROSEWATER.
Jon: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
