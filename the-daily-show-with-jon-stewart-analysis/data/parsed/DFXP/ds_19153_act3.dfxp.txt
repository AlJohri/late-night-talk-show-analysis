(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOM BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, EIGHT YEARS ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE," HIS NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THE SKELETON TWINS."
IS IT OK IF I TELL HIM? CAN I?
NOTHING REALLY TO TELL YET.
READY FOR BIG NEWS? WE'RE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT.
REALLY?
WE ARE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT.
YEP.
AND I SAY WE ARE BECAUSE IT'S NOT SEXIST THAT WAY. RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
YEAH.
I THOUGHT YOU NEVER WANTED TO HAVE KIDS.
WELL, I MAY HAVE SAID THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL OR SOMETHING BUT OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS ON THAT.
OKAY. NO, THAT'S GREAT. I LOVE KIDS. EXCEPT THE FAT ONES.
PLEASE WELCOME BILL HADER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YA? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT A NICE GROUP OF PEOPLE!
Jon: THEY'RE LOVELY.
THEY'RE LOVELY!
Jon: THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE, AS IT WAS.
WHY HELLO! THIS IS NICE!
Jon: SPEAKING OF LOVELY.
YES.
Jon: YOUR WORK IN THIS IS PHENOMENAL.
OH , WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: IT'S A PHENOMENAL MOVIE AND YOUR WORK IN IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S UH...
THANK YOU.
Jon: WHAT I ALWAYS THINK IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IS TO PLAY -- THERE ARE VERY SERIOUS MOMENTS IN THIS, BUT YOU ARE ABLE TO BREAK IT WITH COMEDY BUT IN A VERY ORGANIC WAY...
YEAH.
Jon: LIKE KEEPING IT VERY REAL, VERY HUMAN.
YEAH, AND THAT IS, THAT'S TOUGH. A LOT OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE SCRIPT THAT THIS GUY CRAIG JOHNSON THE DIRECTOR WROTE. IT WAS ALL THERE, THIS BALANCE THAT THEY HAVE, THIS TONAL BALANCE WHICH IS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO GET...
Jon: REALLY HARD.
INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET. BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY HIS EDITOR JENNY LEE WAS REAL GOOD BECAUSE KRISTEN WIIG AND I WOULD SOMETIMES DO THINGS THAT WERE REALLY FUNNY AND YOU'RE KIND OF, LIKE, WELL THESE TWO PEOPLE SHOULD BE ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE! (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE, THEY'RE DOING REALLY GOOD VOICES...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND LIKE PRETTY SOLID IMPRESSIONS, YOU KNOW.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE EDITOR WAS LIKE, THEY HAD A DISCIPLINE, I FELT LIKE...
Jon: RIGHT.
AS A FILMMAKER. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, LIKE SOMETIMES WITH COMEDY, IF IT'S FUNNY, IT SHOULD STAY IN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT PLAYS, IT SHOULD STAY IN.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I GIVE HIM A LOT OF DISCIPLINE -- A LOT OF CREDIT FOR BEING DISCIPLINED, YOU KNOW.
Jon: CAUSE IT MAKES SENSE. CAUSE IF YOU'RE PLAYING A REAL CHARACTER IT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE THAT HE DOES A DEAD-ON JAMES MASON IMPRESSION.
MOST PEOPLE...
Jon: OR ANY OF THAT.
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO DO THAT IN LIFE ANYWAY?
Jon: SEEMS WEIRD. SEEMS LIKE A VERY OBSCURE, ESOTERIC.
YEAH.
Jon: YET IT TAKES A VERY TALENTED INDIVIDUAL TO DO THAT.
YEAH. OH YEAH.
Jon: WORKING WITH KRISTEN, WAS THAT, YOU KNOW YOU GUYS HAD SPENT SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER BUILDING A RAPPORT AND NOW YOU'RE PLAYING BROTHER AND SISTER. WAS IT -- BECAUSE IN THE FILM YOU HAVE TO MAKE EACH OTHER LAUGH A LOT.
YEAH.
Jon: IN THE WAY THAT SIBLINGS CAN DO. IT'S ALMOST THAT SECRET TWINS LANGUAGE.
YEAH. WELL, WE HAVE THAT FROM WORKING AT SNL FOR SO LONG TOGETHER, AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A SCENE IN THE MOVIE WHERE WE'RE ON NITROUS.
Jon: YES. WHERE SHE WORKS.
WHERE SHE WORKS.
Jon: YES.
AT THE NITROUS MUSEUM.
Jon: SURE!
NO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SHE'S A NITROUS MINER!
SHE'S A NITROUS MINER!
Jon: YES.
SHE'S LIKE HELLO, GET IN HERE! NO, BUT WE'RE HANGING OUT, AND WE DO NITROUS. SHE WORKS AT A DENTIST OFFICE. AND THAT WAS ONE SCENE WHERE CRAIG SAID, JUST GO NUTS, MAKE EACH OTHER LAUGH AND HAVE FUN. AND LINDSEY SHOOKUS WHO RUNS THE TALENT DEPARTMENT AT  SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SAW THE MOVIE, AND SHE GOES, WHEN I SAW THAT SCENE, IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS BACK ON FRIDAY NIGHT WATCHING YOU GUYS REHEARSE.
Jon: OH THAT'S NICE.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE WOULD JUST GET REAL LOOPY. WE CALLED IT THE FRIDAY NIGHT CRAZIES. IT WAS ANNOYING. IT WASN'T NICE. IT WAS ANNOYING. (LAUGHTER) SHE MEANT THAT, SHE MEANT THAT.
Jon: COMING FROM EXHAUSTION AND LACK OF SLEEP.
EXHAUSTION. YOU'VE BEEN UP ALL WEEK. YEAH, SHE MEANT THAT MORE IN A THAT WAS AWFUL FOR ME WAY. NO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NO. THERE'S A REAL NOSTALGIA.
NO BUT IT WAS FUN.
Jon: I FIND THIS, THAT FOR TALENTS LIKE YOU, LIKE KRISTEN, THERE'S A REAL NOSTALGIA FOR WHEN YOU GUYS WERE TOGETHER.
YEAH.
Jon: AND THAT, DO YOU FEEL THAT AS WELL?
YEAH.
Jon: THERE'S LIKE A, IT WAS...
THANK YOU.
Jon: A VERY MAGICAL KIND OF THING.
IT WAS.
Jon: THOSE GOODBYES WERE SO HEARTBREAKING.
OH MY GOSH.
Jon: AND TOUCHING.
OH, WHEN KRISTEN SAID GOODBYE, WE WERE ALL CRYING, AND THEN WHEN I DID MY GOODBYE AS STEFAN, AND WITH ME AND SETH AND EVERYTHING.
Jon: I KNOW.
WE WERE CRYING.
Jon: I KNOW!
AND WE ALL START CRYING. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS IS, I WENT OUT, I DID MINE AND CRIED AND THEN KRISTEN SHE DIDN'T TELL ME, I THOUGHT SHE WAS IN L.A., AND THEN I LOOK AND SHE WAS STANDING THERE.
Jon: OH MY GOD.
SHE SURPRISED ME AND SHE CAME AND GAVE ME A HUG, AND I WAS LIKE, OH! I LOVE YOU! AND LAUREN WAS, LIKE, YOU CAN STAY, IF YOU WANT... (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THERE'S PLENTY ROOM HERE. (LAUGHTER)
I CAN GIVE YOU WHATEVER YOU WANT... (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT IS IT, I'M ALWAYS THOUGH TAKEN BY THE RANGE. YOU KNOW, PERFORMERS -- STEVE CARELL IS ALSO IN...
YEAH.
Jon: THIS UPCOMING MOVIE "FOXCATCHER."
UNBELIEVABLE.
Jon: HE IS PHENOMENAL IN IT.
UNBELIEVABLE.
Jon: YOU AND KRISTEN, AS REAL ACTORS -- AND I WONDER, FOR STANDUPS, THAT SEEMS LIKE MAGIC, AND I'M WONDERING, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS COME FROM A BACKGROUND OF IMPROV AND OF SCENE WORK. DOES THAT INFORM YOUR ABILITY TO MAYBE CREATE THESE CHARACTERS IN A WAY THAT -- AS STANDUPS I THINK WE'RE VERY ENVIOUS OF THAT ABILITY. DON'T, I DON'T KNOW THAT, AND I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR EVERYBODY. I THINK THAT ROBIN OBVIOUSLY HAD THAT GEAR AS WELL.
RIGHT.
Jon: BUT TO CREATE THAT KIND OF THING IS MORE DIFFICULT.
IT IS. YOU KNOW, AND SO MUCH OF IT IS JUST TRYING LIKE, CAUSE  FROM OUR STANDPOINT WITH STANDUPS, I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE TELL JOKES. I MEAN SNL I LEANED REALLY HEAVILY ON THE WRITERS BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO...
Jon: RIGHT.
THE ECONOMY OF A JOKE.
Jon: RIGHT.
IS SOMETHING I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND, SO, NO, IT'S A LOT OF FUN AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST GETTING INTO A CHARACTER. SO MUCH OF IT IS, YOU KIND OF DO A LOT OF RESEARCH...
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU WORK ON IT REALLY HARD. YOU GET THE WARDROBE, WHAT THE APARTMENT LOOKS LIKE, WHAT YOUR APARTMENT LOOKS LIKE, WHAT YOUR HAIR LOOKS LIKE, EVERYTHING, AND THEN YOU JUST -- BUT THEN WHEN YOU GET ON SET, YOU'RE JUST REACTING TO EVERYBODY.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING I LEARNED.
Jon: MAYBE THAT'S IT, THE IDEA THAT -- IN STANDUP, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ANYBODY.
YEAH YOU HAVE TO LISTEN.
Jon: BUT AS AN IMPROV ACTOR AND SKETCH ACTOR...
YEAH. YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN.
Jon: YEAH!
HMM? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AS A STAND UP, YOU JUST HAVE TO DO NITROUS AND WHATEVER YOU WANT ON STAGE.
YOU DO NITROUS AND JUST SAY (BLEEP) IT.
Jon: WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. IT'S TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND BILL IS UNBELIEVABLE IN IT. KRISTEN AS WELL. "THE SKELETON TWINS," CURRENTLY PLAYING IN SELECT CITIES. OPENS IN MORE ON THIS FRIDAY. GO SEE IT. BILL HADER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
