S [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST FORMER VICE PRESIDENT  OF THESE UNITED STATES. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE  FUTURE."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM AL GORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INTERVIEWER:  THANK  DID.
THANK YOU.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I AM FINE. I LOVE THAT OPENING SKIT. HISS TEAR CALL.
Jon: WE PREFER TO THINK OF  IT AS SKETCH.
SKIT IS FINE. THE KIDS WILL UNDERSTAND. THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE FUTURE"  BY AND THERE'S YOUR NAME RIGHT  THERE. GIVEN THE SALE OF CURRENT TO THE  PEOPLE WHO SOLD IT TO YOU  PERHAPS IT'S PRONUNSED ALGORE. AL JAZEERA. YOU'VE TAKEN A LOT OF GUFF FOR  THAT FOR SELLING TO QATAR.
I'M PROUD OF TRANSACTION. IT'S GOING TO BE A POSITIVE  ADDITION TO THE U.S. MEDIA  LANDSCAPE. THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
Jon: ARE THEY KEEPING SOME  OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMMING? ARE THEY REPLACING IT WITH OTHER  THINGS.
THEY ARE KEEPING A LOT OF THE  SAME PEOPLE. THEY HAVE ALL NEWS ALL THE TIME,  NO COMMERCIAL BREAKS. THEY HAVE A TERRIFIC REPUTATION. THEY'VE EARNED RESPECT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DOES  THAT, NO COMMERCIAL BREAKS CINE  DLRKS MAX THOUGH THE NEWS DIVISION IS NOT AS TIGHT.
PBS NEWSED TO DO IT WITHOUT  COMMERCIAL BREAKS.
Jon: BUT ENTER THIS  MACARTHUR FOUNDATION CAME N. QATAR IS -- THEY ARE THE GUY --  YOU ARE POSTER BOY OF SOUNDING  THE ALARM OVER GLOBAL WARMING. HOW HARD IS THAT WHEN YOU SEE  MANHATTAN FLOOD DO YOU SIT BACK  AND THINK TO YOURSELF LIKE, I TOLD YOU.
NO, NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IS THAT I A DIFFICULT  THINK TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND?
LOOK, THIS THING IS SO  SERIOUS AND SO BEYOND THE  TRADITION YAM BOUNDARIES -- TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES OF WHAT  WE'RE USED TO DEALING WITH. I WISH THE SCIENTISTS WHOSE  WISDOM I HAVE DELIVERED TO  PEOPLE HAD BEEN WRONG. THEY WISH THEY HAD BEEN WRONG. BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING IT. WE'RE PUTTING 90 MILLION TONS OF  GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION EVERY  DAY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AS IF IT'S AN OPEN SEWER. IT TRAPS MORE HEAT EVERY DAY  THAN -- WELL, THE EQUIST LENT  OF -- EQUIVALENT 400,000 HERE HIROSHIMA BOMBS EVERY DAY  ACCORDING TO A SCIENTIST. THIS IMPACTS ALL THE REST. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT  IT. AND, YET, YOU KNOW, EARTH INC.,  IT RELINES FOSSIL ENERGY FOR 85%  OF ALL THE ENERGY AND IT WILL TAKE TIME. SOLAR ENERGY, WIND ENERGY,  EFFICIENCY ARE COMING DOWN IN  PRICE RAPIDLY. A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE MOVING  TOWARDS A CARBON TAX OR CAP AND  TRADE OR BOTH. EVEN CHINA NOW HAS A PILOT. THEY ARE ANNOUNCING THE PILOT  FOR THE NATIONAL PROGRAM IN TWO  YEARS.
Jon: RIGHT. THERE'S REASONS FOR OPTIMISM BUT  WE HAVE TO GET BUSY ABOUT  SOLVING THEM.
Jon: THAT'S -- HERE IS THE  CONFUSION FOR ME OR THE  DIFFICULTY. WE HAVE TO GET BUSY SOLVING IT. THERE WERE THINGS YOU COULD DO,  TAKE A SHORTER SHOWER, LICK YOUR  CHILDREN DRY. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THOSE THINGS YOU COULD DO  BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING  IT -- THERE ROOM IN -- CAN MOBILE AL GORE WHO HAS CURRENT  TV AND SELLS IT TO QATAR WHICH  IS AN OIL-BASED ECONOMY, CAN MOGUL AL GORE COEXIST WITH  ACTIVIST ALL GORE AND IS THAT --  AL GORE AND IS THAT -- IF YOU COULDN'T FIND FOR YOUR BUSINESS  A MORE SUSTAINABLE CHOICE TO  SELL TO.
I THINK IT IS SUSTAINABLE. WHAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE ABOUT  IT?
Jon: A NONFOSSIL FUEL BASED  BUYER?
LOOK. THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY,  MOST EXTENSIVE BEST CLIMATE  COVERAGE OF ANY NETWORK IN THE  WORLD. JEFF GODELL TWEETED TODAY ON  WHAT AL JAZEERA IS DOING ON  CLIMATE COVERAGE. THEY ARE VERY, VERY GOOD.
Jon: THE BAR IS NOT HIGH.
THE BAR IS NOT HIGH.
Jon: WE DON'T HAVE CLIMATE  CHANGE COVERAGE IN AMERICA.
IT'S MAYBE BEGINNING TO  CHANGE SINCE SUPERSTORM SANDY. THINK ABOUT LAST YEAR WE WENT  THROUGH THIS LERKS -- ELECTION  LEER WHICH HAPPENED TO THE HOTTEST IN THE COUNTRY. 60% IN DROUGHT. BIG FIRES IN THE WEST,  SUPERSTORM SANDY, $110 BILLION  IN CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS AND WE HAD ALL THESE PRESIDENTIAL  DEBATES, NOT ONE SINGLE  JOURNALIST IN ANY OF THE DEBATES ASKED ANY OF THE CANDIDATES A  SINGLE QUESTION ABOUT THE  CLIMATE CRISIS. THAT IS PATHETIC.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THERE'S  ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO QUESTION.
SO HERE YOU HAVE AN  AWARD-WINNING NETWORK THAT HAS A  ESTABLISHED ITS REPUTATION FOR EXCELLENCE THAT DOES TERRIFIC  CLIMATE COVERAGE. THEY WANT TO COME IN HERE AND  GIVE 24/7 COMMERCIAL FREE  OUTSTANDING NEWS REPORTING AND GIVE COVERAGE TO THE CLIMATE  ISSUE, WHY NOT?
Jon: THAT I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU ALREADY HAVE. CURRENT WAS A NEWS ORGANIZATION  THAT COULD HAVE ZN DON THAT.
WITHOUT -- COULD HAVE DONE  THAT.
WITHOUT DEEP POCKETS. BEING AN INDEPENDENT. I'M PROUD OF MY PARTNER AND I  DID. WE WON AWARDS. WE WERE COMPETING AS INDEPENDENT  WITHOUT DEEP POCKETS. AS THE COME GLOM RATES WANT TO  ADVERTISE TO CONSUMERS THEY DO  THAT FOR FREE ACROSS THIS AISLE. WE HAVE TO PAY PREMIUM DOLLAR. WE WERE PROFITABLE EVERY YEAR  BUT WE GOT TO A POINT WHERE WE  COULD NOT KEEP GOING. WE HAD TO SELL. THIS ORGANIZATION HAS EARNED THE  RIGHT TO BE RESPECTED FOR WHAT  IT IS. AND IN ANY DECISION, JON, YOU  HAVE FROZEN -- WHEN I DID THE  DILIGENCE.
Jon: THIS IS MY POINT  THOUGH. PROS AND CONS. COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. ONE OF MAJOR FACTORS.
YES.
Jon: WOULD BE I WOULD THINK  SUSTAINABILITY. YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A  STATEMENT PROBABLY ABOUT YOUR  PRINCIPLES AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD FEEL, AND FOR ME AS WELL, I  THOUGHT IT WAS AN ODD MOVE NOT  BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ORIGINAL THINGS BUT BECAUSE IT'S BACKED  BY FOSSIL FUEL MONEY.
I GET IT. IT WAS AN EASY CHOICE AFTER  DOING THE DILIGENCE ON THE  NETWORK ITSELF.
Jon: CAN YOU SEE HOW PEOPLE  AT HOME WOULD THINK -- HE'S  ASKING ME TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT LIGHT BULBS AND A COST BENEFIT  ANALYSIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF  SUSTAINABILITY WHEN I JUST WANT TO SEE MY BOOK. THAT'S THE ISSUE.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS  UNSUSTAINABLE ABOUT A NETWORK  WITH THIS REPUTATION --
Jon: IT'S THE BACKERS. IT'S MORE WHERE IT COMES FROM.
THEY ARE A STRONG ALLY OF THE  UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE ANNOUNCED A COMMITMENT  TO SHIFT TO REKNUBLE ENERGY. THERE'S A -- RENEWABLE ENERGY. THERE'S A VISIONARY PLAN -- YEAH  WITH SOLAR AND WIND. TO BUILD ON THE SOLAR AND WIND  RESOURCES IN THAT REGION AND  FEED INTO A TRANSCONTINENTAL NETWORK INTO WESTERN EUROPE. THERE'S ACTIVITY GOING ON. THEY ARE ONE OF OUR STRONG --  PROBABLY OUR STRONGEST ALLEY IN  THE -- ALLY IN THE ARAB WORLD. SECRETARY CLINTON SAID AL  JAZEERA IS NOT PART OF THE  PROBLEM BUT THE SOLUTION. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IT. I COMPLETELY GET THE CRITICISM  BUT IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE AND THE  NET BENEFIT FOR THE U.S. IS  POSITIVE.
Jon: IT SHOWS. THE BOOK TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE  SUSTAINABILITY OF CAPITALISM. CAPITALISM IS BASED IN  CONSUMPTION AND VERY DIFFICULT  TO REFORM IT EVEN WHILE IT'S BEING ONE OF THE STAUNCHEST  DEFENDERS OF SUSTAINABILITY. MY POINT WAS ONLY IN HOW  COMPLICATED THE TIES ARE.
I GET I. IT'S COMPLICATED. I COMPLETELY BELIEVE IN THIS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT  CHOICE. IF I COULD TALK FOR A MOMENT  ABOUT SUSTAINABLE CAPITALISM.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO GO TO I  BELIEVE BEER AND VIOLENT MOVIES  AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY
