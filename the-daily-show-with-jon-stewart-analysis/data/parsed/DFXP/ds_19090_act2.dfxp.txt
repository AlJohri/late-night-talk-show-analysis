[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW AMERICA HAS IN MY MIND A LONG TRADITION OF POLITICAL ATTACK ADS. IN THE 2010 WEST VIRGINIA SENATE RACE DEMOCRAT JOE MANCHIN TOOK THE ATTACK AD CONCEPT TO A SOMEWHAT MORE LITERAL LEVEL, USING A DEAD BOLT RIFLE TO MURDER A COPY OF THE FEDERAL CAP AND TRADE BILL. BY THE WAY, THE BILL NOW OF COURSE RESIDES ABOVE SENATOR MANCHIN'S FIREPLACE. OF COURSE, LIKE ANY VISIONARY MANCHIN HAS HAD HIS IMITATORS.
GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH CARE. WE DON'T WANT IT. WE DON'T NEED IT. WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. THIS IS WHAT I DO TO THAT LAW. PULL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT IS SO PRIMAL. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DOES HE DO TO BILLS HE LIKES? [LAUGHTER] REALLY NOT SURE WHAT THAT WAS. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THESE GENTLEMAN MAY HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF HOW LEGISLATION WORKS.  A LAW ISN'T LIKE A HORCRUX FROM HARRY POTTER WHERE IF YOU DESTROY IT THE THING IT REPRESENTS IS GONE FOREVER. THAT WOULD BE A VERY BIG HOLE IN THE SYSTEM I SPILLED COFFEE ON THE 13th AMENDMENT. BLACK PEOPLE ARE SLAVES AGAIN. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. BUT NOW WE'RE HEADING INTO THE 2014 MID TERM CAMPAIGN SEASON. I WONDER IF WE'LL SEE BILL SHOOTING ADS THAT SOMEHOW OUT (bleep) THE PREVIOUS ONES.
THIS IS WILL BROOKE. WE'RE DOWN HERE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN TODAY AND TALK ABOUT TWO SERIOUS TOPICS, THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND SEE HOW MUCH DAMAGE WE CAN DO TO THIS COPY OF OBAMACARE.
Jon: OH SCARY. A HANDGUN. C'MON YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL OBAMACARE OR GIVE IT  A FLESH WOUND? [LAUGHTER] I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WEREN'T DONE YET. ♪  [LAUGHTER] HOLY (bleep). WHEN DID OPPOSING HEALTH CARE REFORM BECOME THE SUNNY DEATH SCENE FROM THE GODFATHER? THESE CANDIDATE SHOOTS A LAW ADS ARE LIKE DIE HARD SEQUELS. EACH ONE IS GOING TO BE CRAZIER AND MORE DESPERATE THAN THE LAST. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT COULD COME NEXT. WELL, NOT THAT HARD.
HI THERE, I'M WILSHIRE JESSUP, AND I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TWO THINGS, AMERICA AND DOING WEIRD (bleep) TO OBAMACARE. ♪
YOU CAN PRAY FOR A QUICK REPEAL BUT YOU AIN'T GONNA GET IT. ♪ I'M SO SCARED I FALL OFF MY CHAIR AND I'M WONDERING HOW I'LL GET DOWN THE STAIRS ♪ ♪ AT LEAST SOMEBODY IS CUTTING EARMARKS. [LAUGHTER] ♪ STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU
I'LL WILLSHIRE JESSUP AND I'LL (bleep) ANY BILL OBAMA PASSES. PAID FOR BY CITIZENS AGAINST PAPER. VIEWS EXPRESSED ARE SOLELY THOSE OF WILSHIRE JESSUP. TARANTINO, IF YOU TRY TO SUE ME, YOU WILL FAIL. I'M BROKE AND PAYING CHILD SUPPORT FOR THREE SEPARATE WOMEN. NOT AFFILIATED WITH NAPALM AGAINST OBAMACARE.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
