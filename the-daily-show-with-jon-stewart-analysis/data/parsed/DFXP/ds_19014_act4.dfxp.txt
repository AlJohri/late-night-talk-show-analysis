[  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: HELLO. WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING WITH DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ THE BOOK IS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOVERNMENT. CLEARLY YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH THE TEA PARTY AND THE REPUBLICANS IS CLEAR AND BY GOD THEY'VE BEEN HISTORICALLY OBSTINATE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT THAT BEING SAID I ALMOST THINK IT'S MORE IMPERATIVE FOR THE OPPOSITION TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER BECAUSE WHEN THAT IS THE OPTION, WHEN THAT IS THE OTHER SIDE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT --
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM EVERY POSSIBLE WAY TO --
Jon: THIS IS CORRECT.
THAT'S RIGHT. WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT.
Jon: HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT BOTHER ME ABOUT IT BEYOND THE -- ANYTHING NEW WILL HAVE SOME KINKS. I DO AGREE THAT'S A PART OF IT. THERE SEEMS TO BE A STRANGE DISCONNECT. THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SAID THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE WEB SITE HAD PROBLEMS. AND THEY CLEARLY HAD BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU LIKE YOUR COVERAGE, YOU'LL KEEP IT.
RIGHT.
Jon: BOTH OF THOSE THINGS STRIKE ME AS REALLY TROUBLING AT A FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL. IS THAT UNDERSTANDABLE AS A CONCERN?
WELL, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT WAS PROBLEMATIC THAT THE WEB SITE WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY RIGHT FROM DAY ONE.
Jon: BUT THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF IT. APPARENTLY AFTER A DAY THEY SAID HE FOUND OUT.
I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK PAST AND NOT FOCUS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GET IT.
ALL KIDDING ASIDE THOUGH I KNOW WE'RE ON A COMEDY SHOW SO WE DON'T PUTTING KIDDING ASIDE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE THAT DON'T HAVE IT NOW CAN GET ON THE WEB SITE. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MY TIME POINTING FINGERS AND --
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND APPARENTLY THERE ARE REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES OF MINE WHO SEEM OBSESSED WITH ONLY POINTING FINGERS.
Jon: THERE'S SOMETHING TO SOLVING A PROBLEM BY KNOWING ITS CAUSE, IS THERE NOT?
YES.
Jon: ONLY FOR THE PRESIDENT IT'S HIS SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT. DO YOU GET A SENSE THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT? WOULD YOU SAY IT'S REASONABLE THAT IN YOUR OFFICE YOU HAD A SIGNATURE PLAN FOR FLORIDA AND THE DAY IT LAUNCHED IT CRASHED AND THEY KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND NOBODY TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT WOULDN'T THAT SPEAK TO A MANAGERIAL CRISIS OF SOME SORT?
I THINK IF THERE WERE SERIOUS ENOUGH PROBLEMS THAT IT WAS GOING TO REALLY BE PROBLEMATIC ON THE DAY OF IMPLEMENTATION THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMMUNICATION. BUT AS SOON AS THE ADMINISTRATION BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WERE VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS, THAT HE POINTED JEFF, THE FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE OMD.
Jon: SURE JEFFY Z.
HE'S ABOUT THE BEST THERE IS. TO TRIAGE THE PROBLEMS AND TECH SURGE. FOR MOST PART THE WEB SITE IS ABLE TO BE ACCESSED QUICKLY NOW AND THEY CAN COMPARE COVERAGE. THAT'S WHAT IS CRITICAL.
Jon: IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE PROCESS OF GOVERNMENT THATS CEEFS A JEFFREY --
ZIENTZ.
Jon: OUT OF IT UNTIL THERE'S A PROBLEM? TO IS IT THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS A SNROB WHAT IS IT THAT COULD BE REFORMED TO MAKE IT MORE AGILE AND MAYBE MORE EFFECTIVE AT NOT PUTTING BAND AIDS ON WOUNDS BUT KEEPING US NOT AS WOUNDED?
WHAT I'VE NOTICED IN MY EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT IS SOMETIMES THERE'S TOO MANY COOKS IN THE KITCHEN. YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY INVESTED IN ONE PERSON OR ONE PART OF AN AGENCY. BUT IF YOU HAVE SO MANY DISPAIR YACHT ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A ROLE IN GETTING SOMETHING UP AND RUNNING, THAT CAN BE BUREAUCRACY THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF EFFECTIVE.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE?
I'M NO EXPERT. I CAN'T ANALYZE THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS ON THE WEB SITE.
Jon: REALLY, BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO HAVE YOU FIX MY COMPUTER. I BROUGHT YOU ON TODAY BECAUSE I'M HAVING PROBLEMS WITH OS7.
I'M AWESOME AT THE iPAD.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED TO MY OLD KEYBOARD. WHAT IS THE WEIRD LINE THING.
I HEAR YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ON A SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT SCALE IS THE KIND OF ASSURANCES OF PEOPLE. I UNDERSTAND THE CALF CAVEATS OF IT BUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT OBAMACARE WERE DEFINITIVE THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR HEALTH CARE PLAN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO.
HERE IS THE THING. PRIMARILY YOU DORNT. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE, AND ACTUALLY ITS GUY WHO IS THE CEO OF FLORIDA BLUE.
Jon: THIS IS ZIENTZ.
NO, NO PAT GARRITY. HE WAS ON MEET THE PRESS THIS SUNDAY.
Jon: I WATCHED.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO PUSH THIS NOTION THAT THERE WERE 300,000 CANCELLATIONS. THESE AREN'T CANCELATIONS. THEY ARE TRANSITIONING FREM A POLICY THAT IS NOT THE MINIMUM FLOOR OF BENEFITS FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TOLL ONE THAT S. I HAVE A CONSTITUENT WHO IS A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. THE ONLY INSURANCE THEY COULD GET COST HER $1270 A MONTH. SHE GOT A LETTER SAYING THE POLICY SHE HAD WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.
Jon: NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T REACH THE STABBED YARD OF CARE THAT ARE THE NEW METRICS. IT'S A HIGH RISK POOL PLAN AND THAT IS DISS CONTINUED. THE POLICY THEY WOULD TRANSITION HER TO IS ONLY $640 A MONTH SAVING HER $7,000 A YEAR.
Jon: IT'S A GOOD STORE YAINLD THAT'S BEFORE SHE EVEN GOES ON THE EXCHANGE TO COMPARE PLANS WHERE SHE COULD PROBABLY GET KEEPER COVERAGE.
Jon: THERE'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST LOWER INSURANCE --
BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST ANECDOTAL.
Jon: AND ARE PAYING MORE.
IT'S MORE THAN THAT SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
Jon: NO, NO, PLEASE. THE REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING OVERTIME TO CREATE THIS NARRATIVE THAT THERE WAS MISREPRESENTATION. YOU HAVE ALMOST 50% OF 18-34 YEAR OWLS PAYING $50 A MONTH.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT PAYING ONLY $100 A MONTH. THIS EXPERIENCE IS BETTER AND MORE AFFORDABLE.
Jon: THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS. I DON'T THINK IT'S UNFAIR FOR A REPUBLICAN NARRATIVE TO SUGGEST. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION AND I SAT ACROSS FROM BOTH PEOPLE SELLING IT AT ITS MOST BASIC LEVEL AND THEY SAID DEFINITIVELY IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT TAKEN FROM YOU.
HERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAPPENED THOUGH. WE DID SAY THAT. I WAS ONE OF PEOPLE THAT SAID THAT.
Jon: THAT'S ALL THAT IS. SO I THINK THAT IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT WE'RE WORKING TO MITIGATE IT. INSTEAD YOU GET A BIG WALL OF REPUBLICANS ARE BAD. I KNOW ALL THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO GET TO THE REASONABLE CRITICISM, I THINK, THAT I THINK DESERVES A BETTER SMONS THAT THEATERIBLE AND ALL THAT. [  APPLAUSE  ]
MY RESPONSE IS NOT JUST THAT THEY THEATERIBLE.
Jon: I KNOW.
THE COVERAGE YOU ARE GETTING NOW FOR THE MOST PART IF IT'S NOT THE SAME BECAUSE YOUR POLICY IS DISCONTINUED IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE. A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR, IF YOU ARE UNDERINSURED BREAST CANCER PATIENT, I'VE HAD WOMEN COME UP TO ME SAYING DEBBIE I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE CHEMO OR RADIATION BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD THE DEDUCTIBLE ON BOTH. THOSE WERE THE PLANS AVAILABLE BEFORE OBAMACARE WHAT SO MANY BARE BONES COVERAGE PROVIDES.
Jon: THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S GOING BE A WORLD OF PEOPLE WHEN THIS GETS UP AND RUNNING IF IT GETS UP AND RUNNING IN THE WAY THAT THEY SAID IT WOULD ARE GOING TO BE HELPED. MY ONLY POINT IS THERE WILL ARE ALSO LOSERS. AND WITHIN THAT -- IF YOU ARE MAKING $30,000 A YEAR AND YOU NEVER HAD HEALTH INSURANCE THAT WAS THE GANLABLE YOU TOOK AND YOU -- GAMBLE YOU TOOK AND YOU GET A SUBSIDY BUT THAT DOESN'T COVERAGE THE WHOLE COST OF THE BRONZE PLAN.
IT LOWERS YOUR MONTHLY PREMIUM, SIGNIFICANTLY.
Jon: LET'S SAY IT'S $300 AND YOU GET A $300 SUB DID I -- SUBSIDY. IT'S STILL $100 A MONTH FOR SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T WANT SOMETHING.
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT --
Jon: IF YOU HAVE A CAN A FIDEL CASTRO IF I PLAN.
ONE DAY I WAS THE PICTURE OF HEALTH NEXT DAY A BREAST CANCER PATIENT F. YOU ARE SOMEONE WITH A CATASTROPHE PLAN, YOU CANNOT GET THE HEALTH CARE YOU NEED TO SAVE YOUR LIVE WITH A CATASTROPHE PLAN WHEN YOU FIND OUT ONE DAY YOU HAVE CANCER.
Jon: SURE. I'M UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE BURYING UNDER THE RUG AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOUR GROUPS GRAPES REAL PEOPLE PUTTING IN REAL SITUATIONS WHERE IF I'M MAKING $30,000 A YEAR AND PAYING $1200 A YEAR FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS A MANDATE.
SOMEONE MAKING $30,000 A YEAR IS VERY LIKELY ALMOST FOR SURE GOING TO PAY LESS FOR THE COVERAGE THEY ALREADY HAVE WITH A SUBSIDY. SOMEONE WHO HAS GONE BARE AND NOT HAD IT IT WILL COST THEM MONEY. THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT FOR THEM.
Jon: THERE STL A WAY TO MITIGATE THEM FOR THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS? THAT'S WHERE IT HITS AND I CAN SEE IT BEING A BURDEN? IS THERE ANYTHING DISCUSSED THAT MAYBE COULD BE DONE FOR THEM THAT COULD HELP AMEALORRATE THAT DID.
AMEALATE THAT.
WE NEED REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO SIT DOWN.
Jon: YOU ARE ABOUT TO THROW IT BACK TO THE BOOK.
AT LEAST ONCE.
Jon: YOU ARE A TRUE PROAFNTIONAL. IT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS.
IT DOESN'T. FOR AS A MOM FOR ME WE SHOULD BE MEASURING.
Jon: IT HAS THE ANSWERS. YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO THEM BEFORE.
IT HAS ONE OR TWO. I AGREE. IF THEY WOULD JUST LISTEN TO ME, EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE.
Jon: ONE OF BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS IS I THINK WHEN I BRING UP A CONCERN THAT IS VALID OR DISCUSSES THAT IS NOT PART OF PURELY THE PARTISAN MACHINE AND I THINK WE'RE ALL SO CONDITIONED TO SHUT THINGS DOWN THAT ARE NEGATIVE BASED ON POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE THAT WE FIND IT HARD TO TALK ABOUT THE REAL COLLATERAL OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THINGS.
IF REPUBLICANS ARE DEMOCRATS ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND SORT THROUGH THE CHALLENGES.
Jon: RIGHT.
ESPECIALLY IF WE PUT THE WOMEN IN THE ROOM. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC WOMEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAID IF THEY LOCK US IN A ROOM WE COULD GET THIS DONE IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
Jon: CAN I SAY THIS? YP DON'T YOU DO THAT? THEY ALWAYS HAVE THAT CRAZY THING. THEY TALK ABOUT THE GANG OF EIGHT AND JOHN McCAIN COMESS IN THIS A JET PACK. FORGET ABOUT IF THEY LET YOU, JUST DO IT.
THEY DID IN THE SENATE. THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
Jon: DO IT WITH THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND COME TOGETHER WITH A PLAN AND PRESENT IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WE WOULDN'T -- I BET PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE OH, MY GOD THAT'S THE ANSWER. THEN YOU TAKE HER AND THEN WE CREATE LIKE A GLAMAZON SOCIETY WHERE MEN ARE SUBSERVIENT WERE CHAINED ALL DAY WEARING WEIRD FLYNNSTONES OUTFITS THANK WORKS FOR ME.
Jon: YOU ARE IN CHARGE AND IT'S ALL GOOD.
WORKS FOR ME. SOUNDS GOOD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I JUST WROTE MY NEXT MOVIE. NEXT GENERATION SON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THANKS FOR COMING ON.
THANK YOU.
