( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. JOIN US NEXT WEEK AT 11:00. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, FRIDAY NIGHT, YOU'RE GOING OUT. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE "BRIDESMAIDS." GOING TO BE A HUGE OPENING, NUMBER ONE FILM. SATURDAY NIGHT, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO STAY IN AND WATCH WYATT  CENAC'S HOUR-LONG STAND-UP SPECIAL RIGHT HERE ON COMEDY CENTRAL. IT'S WYATT CENAC FOR AN HOUR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I WORK HERE-- I BARELY GET TO SPEND THAT KIND OF TIME WITH HIM. SO IT'S A VERY STRONG OPPORTUNITY. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
THE WHITE HOUSE HOPES TO PUT THAT BEHIND HIM AND JAY CARNEY HOPES TO NEVER REVIEW ANOTHER  RAP STAR.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HAVE ANY RAP STAR COME TO THE WHITE  HOUSE WITH ANY OF THEIR LYRICS.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  Captioned by    Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
