Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE. OUR GUEST, LAURA LINNEY. SHE'S IN THE NEW MOVIE IN "HYDE  PARK ON THE HUDSON."  DAISY WAS APPARENTLY F.D.R.'S CONFIDANTE AT A TIME WHEN  CONFIDANTE MEANT "GUY I HAVE SEX  WITH."  (LAUGHTER) WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN MICHIGAN  WHERE TEN MONTHS AGO MICHIGAN'S  GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER --  (LAUGHTER). THAT'S DEE SNYDER. DUKE SNYDER. THAT'S ROY SCHEIDER. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S JUST A PICTURE OF ME  LOOKING AKNOWED WITH THIS BIT. THERE WE GO. RICK SNYDER. ANYWAY, THIS (BLEEP) GUY. MICHIGAN GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER  WENT BEFORE CONGRESS TEN MONTHS  AGO TO SAY HE WAS NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED AT THIS  TIME IN MAKING THE BEDROCK UNION  STATE OF MICHIGAN A RIGHT TO WORK STATE.
RIGHT TO WORK IS AN ISSUE  THAT IS A VERY DIVISIVE ISSUE. PEOPLE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT  IT. WE HAVE MANY PROBLEMS IN  MICHIGAN THAT ARE MUCH MORE  PRESSING THAT I WANT TO FIND COMMON GROUND ISSUES WE CAN WORK  TOGETHER ON BEFORE WE GET INTO  DIVISIVE ISSUES.
Jon: (WHISPERING)  GOING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER)  HE WAS GOING TO FOCUS ON COMMON  GROUND THINGS PEOPLE FROM  MICHIGAN WANT AND NEED. MORE ROBOCOPPERS ON THE STREETS  OF NEW DETROIT. (LAUGHTER)  GETTING THE TOURISM BOARD TO  WORK A LITTLE HARDER ON ITS NEW  SLOGAN. (LAUGHTER)  AND FINALLY --  (APPLAUSE). FINALLY MICHIGAN WAS GOING TO  FIN THEIR STATUE I HAVE BEEN  PETITIONING FOR ONLINE. (LAUGHTER)  THEY'VE GOT A ROCKY STATUE IN  PHILLY, THEY SHOULD HAVE A KID  ROCK STATUE IN DETROIT. THAT'S SOME BULL (BLEEP) RIGHT  THERE. (LAUGHTER)  NONE OF THAT IS DONE. HE HASN'T DONE ANY OF IT SO --
MOMENTS AGO THE MICHIGAN  HOUSE APPROVED A RIGHT-TO-WORK BILL THE STATE SENATE PASSED  LAST WEEK.
Jon: DOESN'T MATTER. YOUR GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT TO  WORK ON THAT DIVISIVE ISSUE.
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK  SNYDER PROMISES TO SIGN THE BILL  AS SOON AS IT HITS HIS DESK WHICH COULD BE WITHIN HOURS.
Jon: ACTUALLY, BETWEEN THE  TIME THAT WE CUT THAT SOUNDBITE  AND NOW HE ALREADY SIGNED IT! SO (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN? SO WHAT? SO WHAT? SO THIS GUY WHO REALLY LOOKS  PLEASANT ENOUGH. (LAUGHTER)  , MAYBE IT WON'T BE SO BAD. I MEAN, THE PHRASE "RIGHT TO  WORK" IS SUCH A POSITIVE AND  UPLIFTING MESSAGE. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY DO TO  ORGANIZATIONS LIKE UNIONS THAT  ALSO SUPPORTS WORKERS RIGHTS. THE LAW PROBABLY STRENGTHENS  UNIONS.
IT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR  UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS TO MANDATE  THAT EMPLOYEES BE PART OF A UNION OR PAY ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY  TO THAT UNION.
Jon: OR DESTROY THE ONLY  LEVERAGE UNIONS HAVE TO STAY  AFLOAT, ONE OR THE OTHER. SO IT'S REALLY A RIGHT-TO-WORK  AROUND THE UNION FOR THE  CORPORATIONS. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT  ARE ACTUALLY NAMED FOR THE  OPPOSITE OF THE THING THEY DO. LIKE STRIP BARS CALL THEMSELVES  GENTLEMEN'S CLUBS. (LAUGHTER)  OR THE T.V. NETWORK DEDICATED TO  MAKING US STUPIDER IS CALLED  "THE LEARNING CHANNEL." (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OR A T.V. SHOW THAT ONLY AIRS  FOUR DAYS A WEEK CALLS IT A DAILY SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHAT'S THE DEAL, GOVERNOR  SNYDER?
I SID THIS WASN'T ON MY  AGENDA FOR SOME TIME BUT IF YOU  LOOK AT IT, WE'RE LOSING A MAJOR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. INDIANA HAS BECOME A  RIGHT-TO-WORK STATE AND I'VE  LOOKED AT THEIR PIPELINE. THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY  INCREASED THE NUMBER OF  BUSINESSES LOOKING TO COME TO INDIANA AND GROW IN INDIANA DUE  TO THIS LEGISLATION.
Jon: INDIANA! THOSE SWEET-FACED GOOD NATURED  JOB-STEALING SONS OF BITCHES. (LAUGHTER)  WAIT A MINUTE, LET'S GO WITH THE  RIGHT SPACING FOR THAT. INDIA, NORTH AMERICA! WELL, DON'T THINK WE WON'T  DETECT YOUR CALL CENTER ACCENTS,  INDIA N.A. HOW ARE MICHIGAN'S UNION MEMBERS  AKING THIS NEWS?T
PROUNION PROTESTERS ARE SWARMING THE CAPITAL BUILDING IN  LANCING.
HEY, HEY, HO, HO, RIGHT TO  WORK HAS GOT TO GO.
UNION BUSTING IS DISGUSTING! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: DUDE, YOU'RE FROM  MICHIGAN, DETROIT, "8 MILE."  YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH BETTER RHYMES THAT  BUSTING-DISGUSTING IF YOU WANT  TO WIN THE CLIMACTIC RAP BATTLE. YOU HAVE TO PUT EFFORT INTO IT. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LOOK, YOU HAVE ONE JOB AT ONE  FACTORY, WHEN YOU SEIZE EVERY BENEFIT YOU COULD, YO, OUR PALMS  ARE SWEATY, KNEES WEEK, ARMS  HEAVY, WORKING IN A FACTORY ALL DAY BUILDING CHEVYS, LIKE THE  VOLT, YOU PLUG IT IN, AND THEN  YOU WIN -- ECOLOGICALLY, BECAUSE IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL RACE YOU  WOULD NOT -- ACTUALLY. YOU'VE GOT TO DUES COLLECT FOR  THE UNIONS ORO BAHTS ARE GOING  TO COME AND TAKE AWAY OUR JOBS OR TO THE CHINESE KIDS WITH THE  TINY HANDS TO WORK AND GO --  â™ª THIS OF HA TUNETY COMES ONCE IN A LIFETIME NOTE? NOTE YO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED? IF I PERFORM MY HOFF-TORAH A AS  BAD AS THAT I WOULD OWE MY  RELATIVES MONEY. FOR MORE WE GO TO AASIF MANDVI  IN MICHIGAN AND JASON JONES IN  INDIANA. THERE'S NOT MUCH KPET ADVANTAGE  IN DOING SOMETHING THAT ALMOST  HALF THE OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE.
HEY, JON, MICHIGAN DOESN'T  HAVE TO BEAT HALF THE COUNTRY,  WE JUST HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN  INDIANA.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. MICHIGAN'S NOT A STATE! IT'S MORE OF A DINGLE BERRY  HANGING OFF CANADA'S --  (LAUGHTER).
INDIANA'S A GREAT PLACE TO  SEND JOBS! IT'S GOT THE WEATHER OF NORTH  DAKOTA AND THE RACIAL HARMONY OF  MISSISSIPPI! (LAUGHTER)
INDIANA DIDN'T TAKE  MICHIGAN'S JOBS, ALL RIGHT? MICHAEL MOORE ATE THEM! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW THAT BOTH INDIANA  AND MICHIGAN HAVE THE EXACT SAME RIGHT TO WORK LAWS, THOUGH, HOW  ARE YOU GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE  YOURSELVES?
RIGHT TO WORK? JON, COME ON, THAT IS SO 11  MONTHS AGO. INDIANA'S LATEST PRO-BUSINESS  MEASURE IS THE WORKPLACE SAFETY  ACT. ANY BUSINESS THAT RELOCATES HERE  GETS TO DUMP WHATEVER THEY WANT  WHEREVER THEY WANT FOR FREE. LAKES, RIVERS, WETLANDS. THEY TAKE ALL FACTORIES TOXIC  SLURRY.
Jon: YOU CALL THAT  WORKPLACE SAFETY ACT.
STUDIES SHOW POISONING THE  ENVIRONMENTS CUTS WORKPLACE  BEAVER BITES DOWN TO ZERO. NO MORE RACCOON MAULINGS OR  SLIPPING ON THE O *D TOAD ON A  FACTORY FLOOR. DOW CHEMICAL IS VERY  INTERESTING.
THAT'S NO MATCH FOR  MICHIGAN'S LATEST PRO-BUSINESS  MEASURE. WORK FORCE EDUCATION.
Jon: YEAH, I'M GOING TO  GUESS THAT'S NOT REALLY  EDUCATING WORKERS, IS IT?
IT'S THE OPPOSITE! IF YOUR BUSINESS NEEDS CHEAP  WORKERS TO PULL LONG HOURS,  MICHIGAN WILL TURN ITS SCHOOLS INTO FACTORIES! NO MORE RECESS, KIDS, NOW IT'S A  FIVE-MINUTE SMOKE BREAK THEN  BACK TO THE METAL-STAMP  MAGAZINE! NEWSPAPER.
NICE TRY. BUT INDIANA HAS THE PENSION  ACCELERATION ACT.
Jon: FOR GOD'S SAKE WHAT  ARE YOU EUTHANIZING WORKERS WHEN  THEY HIT RETIREMENT AGE?
COME ON! ISN'T THAT BRILLIANT?
YEAH, WELL WE WILL BUILD YOU  A PIT WHERE YOU CAN THROW YOUR  PAYROLL AND WATCH WORKERS FIGHT OVER IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT ARMED  ONLY WITH THE BONES OF THE  FORTUNATE DEAD.
Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,  WHAT IS THAT CALLED?
THAT IS THE INCENTIVE-BASED  COMPENSATION BILL. GOVERNOR SNYDER SAYS HE'S READY  TO SIGN IT.
Jon: .
SON OF A BITCH!
WHO'S THE DINGLEBERRY NOW,  JONES, HUH?
Jon: GUYS! THESE MEASURES ARE CREATIVE BUT  THEY DON'T CREATE JOBS. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO POACH JOBS  FROM NEIGHBORING STATES BY  SELLING OUT YOUR OWN WORKERS. IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM.
BUT WHOEVER GETS TO THE  BOTTOM FIRST WINS, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT.
THEN IT'S ON!
YEAH, (BLEEP)! COME ON!
Jon: AASIF MANDVI
