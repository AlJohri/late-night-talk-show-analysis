[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A STAR OF  "PARKS AND RECREATION." HIS BOOK IS CALLED "PADDLE YOUR  OWN CANOE." WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, NICK  OFFERMAN. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WELL DONE, SIR. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WELL DONE, SIR.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR THE SCOTCH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE ALWAYS LIKE TO BE  HELPFUL. THIS IS THE BOOK HERE. "PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE." ONCE AGAIN, I'M OFFENDED BY  SOMEONE PEDALLING HOLLYWOOD  VALUES SUCH AS HARD WORK AND  LOVING YOUR WIFE.
WELL --
Jon: WELL, PEOPLE READ THIS  BOOK AND LIVE BY THE CODE OF  OFFERMAN. HAPPY, HAPPY LIFE.
IT'S SMUT. IT'S RIFE WITH FLANNEL SHIRTS.
Jon: YOU'RE A RENAISSANCE  MAN.
I'M A MIDWESTERNER WE CALL  IT. [LAUGHTER] SADLY THESE DAYS IF YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PHILLIPS  SCREWDRIVER AND A STANDARD HEAD, YOU'RE A RENAISSANCE MAN.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. THIS CANOE, IS THIS THE ACTUAL  CANOE THAT YOU BUILT?
THAT'S MY FIRST CANOE. I BUILT THAT IN A SHOP IN  REDHOOK BROOKLYN, ACTUALLY. WE WERE LIVING IN TOWN. MY WIFE WAS DOING A BROADWAY  SHOW AND I WAS BORED. [LAUGHTER] SO I BUILT MY FIRST CANOE.
Jon: NOW WE ALL HAVE THEM  SINCE HURRICANE SANDY.
THAT'S RIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE ALL HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD CANOES. WHEN DID YOU FIRST START --  BECAUSE WOODWORKING -- WOULD YOU SAY YOU KNOW HOW TO DO MANY  THINGS? WOODWORKING IS MAYBE THE  PASSION.
SURE, YEAH, IF I HAD TO PICK  ONE THING BESIDES WORKING AS A  CLOWN, IT WOULD BE MAKING THINGS OUT OF WOOD.
Jon: YES. WHAT IS IT -- BECAUSE I ALSO --  I HAPPEN TO DABBLE. WHEN DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN  WOODWORKING? HOW DID IT BECOME A PASSION? YOU MAKE YOUR OWN FURNITURE.
WELL, I GREW UP USING TOOLS. MY FAMILY ARE THESE GREAT  FARMERS AND MY DAD IS AN AMATEUR FURNITURE MAKER THROUGH MY  YOUTH. AND THEN I STARTED BUILDING  SCENERY PROFESSIONALLY FOR MANY  YEARS BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET  GOOD PARTS IN THE PLAY.
Jon: YOU CAN NOW.
CAN I BUILD THE CASTLE?
Jon: AND THEN IN LOS ANGELES, TURNS OUT THERE WASN'T A GREAT  THEATER COMMUNITY LIKE IN CHICAGO SO I STARTED BUILDING WHATEVER I COULD. I HAD SORT OF AN EPIPHANY THAT I LOVED MAKING OLD SCHOOL HEIRLOOM FURNITURE PIECES.
Jon: BEAUTIFUL STUFF. DO YOU HAVE YOUR THING?
MY DEVICE?
Jon: YOU GOT TO SEE THIS  THING. IT IS -- FOR SOMEONE THAT HAS DONE WOODWORKING -- I MADE MY SON'S  CHANGING TABLE WHEN HE WAS BORN  AND I LOOKED AT THIS THING AND I FELT INCREDIBLY BAD ABOUT  MYSELF. YOU GOT TO SEE THIS. CAN WE GET THIS? WHICH IS THE GOOD CAMERA? ONE? LOOK AT THIS BAD BOY. HE MADE THIS. TELL US WHAT THIS IS.
THAT'S A REDWOOD BENCH. I RUN A SHOP -- I WAS --
Jon: SO BEAUTIFUL.
I DESIGNED IT AND WORKED ON  IT. BUT I HAVE A LOT OF GREAT HELP. FOR ME TO SAY I MADE THESE IS  RIDICULOUS.  ABOUT 16 OF US MADE THIS. A GREAT OUTPOURING OF LOVE. IT WAS A DONATION TO MY ALMA  MATER, THE UNIVERSITY OF  ILLINOIS. IT WAS EMBARRASSING WHEN YOU  SAID I MADE THIS.
Jon: BUT YOU MADE THE TREE. HE MADE THE TREE.
I DID. I GREW THE TREE.
Jon: NICK OFFERMAN MADE THE  TREE THAT THAT TABLE CAME FROM.
REALLY YOU JUST PLANT A SMALL CONE. YEAH. CONIFERS ARE EASY.
Jon: AND YOU WAIT 300 YEARS  UNTIL IT GETS OLD AND SICKLY. AND THE ONE THING I TRULY  IDENTIFY WITH, YOU TELL A STORY  OF WHEN YOU REALIZED THE  DIFFICULTY OF LIFE IN ACTING  WHEN YOU WENT ON A BUDWEISER  AUDITION.
IT WAS A HORRIBLE DAY.
Jon: A HORRIBLE DAY. BUT NOT HORRIBLE BECAUSE OF THE  CALIBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE  THERE WITH YOU.
YEAH, IT WAS -- SOMETHING  THAT EVERYONE DOES. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A BREAK. ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS GO  AUDITION FOR ANY COMMERCIAL. YOU REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, I  COME FROM A -- I'M A CLASSICALLY TRAINED THEATER ACTOR AND YOU'RE SITTING IN A ROOM WITH A BUNCH OF YAHOOS BECAUSE ANYBODY WHO CAN MAKE A FUNNY FACE CAN GET THIS JOB. THAT'S WHEN I NOTICED THE GUY  WHO PLAYED OGRE ON REVENGE OF  THE NERDS.
NERDS!
YEAH. A HERO OF MINE.
Jon: A HERO.
GOD, EVEN THAT GUY HAS DONE A LOT OF GREAT MOVIES. ACROSS THE ROOM, I SAW CARMINE,  FROM LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY.
Jon: THE BIG RAGOO.
I FELT LIKE A GREEN HORN. I THOUGHT EVEN CARMINE NEEDS TO  MAKE HIS RENT.
Jon: YES. JUST HAVING BEEN ON SOME OF  THOSE AUDITIONS. I CAN REMEMBER IN THE EARLY DAYS OF PEEWEE HERMAN. HE WAS THE BIG THING. EVERYBODY WOULD SHOW UP AND HAD  ON THE RED BOW TIE. YOU THOUGHT, I'M SUCH A [BLEEP]. IT GOES CRAZY. BUT YOU STAYED WITH IT AND NOW  LOOK AT YOU. WELL, IT'S FINE LIFE LESSONS  FROM THE RENAISSANCE MAN. "PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE." NICK OFFERMAN, EVERYBODY.
