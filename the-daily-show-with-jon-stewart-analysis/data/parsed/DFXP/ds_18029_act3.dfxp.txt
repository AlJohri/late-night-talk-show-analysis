(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE LEGENDARY  MUSICIAN WHOSE MEMOIR IS CALLED  "WAGING HEAVY PEACE." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM MR. NEIL YOUNG. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING  HERE.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME, HAVING  ME.
Jon: WE'RE DELIGHTED TO  HAVE YOU. "WAGING HEAVY PEACE" IS THE  BOOK. I HAVE READ -- THERE HAVE BEEN A  SPATE OF THESE THAT HAVE COME  OUT, THESE SORT OF THE ROCK LEGEND AUTOBIOGRAPHIES. SO MANY OF THEM HAVE A FORMALITY  TO THEM, I FELT READING THIS  LIKE I WAS HANGING OUT WITH YOU AS YOU PUTTERED AROUND YOUR  GARAGE OR SOMEHOW WALKING AROUND  --  (LAUGHTER).
YEAH.
Jon: -- INSIDE YOUR BRAIN. IT'S SO -- YOU WROTE THIS  YOURSELF.
YEAH, OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, GHOST WRITERS SCARE  THE HELL OUT OF ME. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NOBODY LIKES GHOSTS.
NOBODY LIKES GHOSTS. (LAUGHTER)  NO, I'M GUILTY AS CHARGED. I WROTE IT.
Jon: BUT IT'S REALLY -- IT  HAS SUCH A HOSPITABLE CHARM TO  IT THAT -- AND YOUR IMAGE IS NOT NECESSARILY AS WARM --
(LAUGHS).
Jon: -- AS THIS BOOK  CLEARLY IS. HAVE YOU BEEN HOLDING OUT ON US  ALL THESE YEARS?
YOU KNOW, BEHIND THE SCENES  I'M REALLY NICE.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
THIS GUY HERE IS JUST NOT  HAPPY LOOKING. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ALWAYS DO  THAT.
Jon: (LAUGHS)  IT'S THE PICTURES THAT MAKE YOU  NOT HAPPY.
IT'S THE PICTURES THAT MAKE  ME LOOK -- AND MAYBE SOME OF THE  SONGS, OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT'S OKAY. I'M -- I'M MOVING PAST THAT NOW. I'M VERY POSITIVE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I FOUND  INTERESTING ABOUT THE BOOK IS  YOU HAVE -- I HAVE FOUND THAT IN MY FAMILY AS I AGE I AM LESS  WILLING TO SELF-REFLECT. I AM MORE RIGID. YOU SEEM THE OPPOSITE, GROWING  AS AN INDIVIDUAL, ACTUALIZING AS  A PERSON THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN STOP NOW. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH. I'M HAVING TROUBLE STOPPING,  JON. I KEEP GOING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: I THINK THAT'S  ADMIRABLE. (APPLAUSE)  THERE IS A -- YOU KNOW, FOR AN  ARTIST SUCH AS YOURSELF-- AND I  THINK PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZE HOW ECLECTIC YOUR TALENTS REALLY  ARE. COULD YOU VERY VERY BRIEFLY,  LIKE AN INVENTOR, MODEL TRAIN  ENTHUSIAST, A PATENT HOLDER.
YEAH. YEAH. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S FUN --
Jon: YOU SHOULD READ THIS,  IT'S A FASCINATING STORY. (LAUGHTER)  THAT GUY'S FASCINATING!
THAT GUY, HE'S SCATTERED.
Jon: NO!
NO, I LOVE DOING THINGS LIKE  THAT. I LOVE TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. I LOVE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS  BETTER IN MY -- JUST FOR ME, YOU  KNOW? I'M NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE  WORLD. I WOULD JUST LIKE IT TO BE BET  SORE THAT WHEN I LOOK AT IT,  IT'S GREAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOT SO I CAN MAKE A MILLION  DOLLARS OR EVEN A GO ZILLION. ALTHOUGH MAKE A --
Jon: A GOZILLION, YOU COULD  REALLY A LOT WITH THAT.
YEAH, YOU COULD.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL IT AS A  PRESSURE? OR JUST AS A STATE OF BEING? DO YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING  AND THINK "I'VE GOT TO MAKE  SOMETHING OF THIS DAY" OR IT'S JUST YOUR RHYTHM?
FOR INSTANCE, I'M WALKING  DOWN THE STREET AND I SEE SOME  BEAUTIFUL GIRL WALKING ALONG.
Jon: I'VE HAD THAT  EXPERIENCE. (LAUGHTER)
SO THAT'S IT. WE'RE TOGETHER.
Jon: EXACTLY. SIMPATICO.
AND SHE'S GOT THESE WHITE  THINGS COMING OUT OF HER EARS  AND I'M GOING "THAT POOR GIRL. SHE'S LISTENING TO REAL CRAP."
Jon: (LAUGHS)  AND I GO "IT'S SO EASY TO FIX  THAT."  AND THEN I PUT TOGETHER A TEAM OF PEOPLE AND WE FIX IT.
Jon: THAT'S THE PONO. SO THIS IS A MAN -- I NEVER  REALIZED IT. I THOUGHT YOU TAKE MUSE FRICK AN  L.P. AND WHEN YOU COMPRESS IT, I  DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH OF IT -- OF THAT INFORMATION YOU LOSE. HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT ADDRESSING  THAT?
WELL, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MP3  LISTENING PARTIES.
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY HAVE VINYL LISTENING  PARTIES, A VINYL EVENING AT MY  HOUSE OR SOMETHING. AND PEOPLE -- LIKE MY OWN  DAUGHTER IS HAVING HER WEDDING  AND SHE'S SO EXCITED AND CALLED ME UP "DADDY, I'VE GOT A D.J.,  THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO PLAY SOUL  45s, REAL 45s AND A TURNTABLE."  AND THEY'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE  YOU CAN FEEL IT, YOU CAN HEAR  IT. SO I DON'T WANT TO GO ON A BIG  RAP HERE, BUT THE 21st  CENTURY DIGITAL, WHAT WE HAVE AT PONO, IT'S NOT YOUR MOTHER'S  DIGITAL.
Jon: I JUST WANT YOU TO  KNOW THAT MY MOTHER STILL  DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWERING MACHINE SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT --  (LAUGHTER). IN TERMS OF DIGITAL YOU DON'T  HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. SHE STILL GETS MILK DELIVERED.
THOSE ARE MY TALKING POINTS.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO GO --  HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO. WE'LL TAKE -- CAN YOU STICK  AROUND FOR A FEW MINUTES?
OH, YEAH.
Jon: WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT  THE INTERESTING LIFE. I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE  STORY WHERE YOU GAVE ALL YOUR  FRIENDS AND FAMILY MARSHMALLOW KEBOBS MADE OF POISON OAK.
THANK YOU, I CAN DO THAT.
Jon: WE'LL GET TO THAT. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. "WAGING HEAVY PEACE" IS ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW. GET IT TO LEARN THAT STORY AND  HOW TO LISTEN TO REAL MUSIC WITH  REAL INFORMATION AROUND IT. NEIL YOUNG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
