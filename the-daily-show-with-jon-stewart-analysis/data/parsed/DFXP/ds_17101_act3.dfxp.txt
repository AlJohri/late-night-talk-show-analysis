[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO NATO. PLEASE WELCOME AMBASSADOR IVO DAALDER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO, SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU. COME AND SIT. HOW ARE YOU?
GREAT.
Jon: IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU. I WOULD THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE AN AMBASSADOR TO NATO WHICH  IS NOT A COUNTRY IT'S A GROUP OF FIGHTER JETS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IS THIS -- HAVE WE ALWAYS HAD AN AMBASSADOR? DOES EACH COUNTRY HAVE AN AMBASSADOR?
WE'RE 28 MEMBERS AND EACH COUNTRY HAS AN AMBASSADOR JUST  LIKE IN THE UNITED NATIONS WHERE EACH COUNTRY HAS AN AMBASSADOR THERE. NATO WAS A MILITARY ALLIANCE SO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF FIGHTER JETS AS COUNTRIES BUT I'M -- I  REPRESENT THE UNITED STATES AT THIS SMALL LITTLE ROUND TABLE WHERE WE DO A LOT --
Jon: IS IT REALLY A ROUND TABLE?
IT REALLY IS. IT'S ROUND.
Jon: ALL 28 COUNTRIES.
HOW LITTLE IS THE TABLE. IS IT GIANT? HOW UNCOMFORTABLE. IN TERMS OF SPACING HOW MUCH ROOM DO YOU HAVE AROUND THIS SMALL TABLE?
GOT NEWS IS THE UNITED STATES COMES LAST IN THE ALPHABET WHEN WE SEAT ACCORDING TO ENGLISH SEATING. IF WE DO IT TO FRENCH WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE.
Jon: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO SIT FRENCH SEEGHT TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO SIT ENGLISH SEATING.
WHAT IS FRENCH SEATING EVERYONE ON EVERYBODY'S LAPS? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ARE THEY MAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME?
THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF --  [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WE HAVE THE NEW NATO SUMMIT. THERE'S A SUMMIT. IN THE UNITED STATES HASN'T BEEN HERE IN A WHILE.
HASN'T BEEN HERE SINCE 1999. THE FIRST TIME WE HAD A SUMMIT THE IT'S OUTSIDE WASHINGTON, D.C. IN THE GREAT STIFF CHICAGO.
Jon: IT'S VERY EXCITING. IT'S THE SMART DEFENSE INITIATIVE. IS THAT CORRECT?
THAT'S ONE OF INITIATIVES WERE PUTTING FORWARD, YES.
Jon: HOW DOES THAT CONTRAST WITH THE DEFENSE INITIATIVES WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST  THAT WE DIDN'T THINK TO NAME SMART?
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WHICH IS --
Jon: THANK YOU.
IT REALLY IS BECAUSE IT ISN'T TRUE THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING DUMB  DEFENSE UP TO THAT POINT. WE NOTICED THAT.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY SMART DEFENSE YOU DON'T THINK OOH I THINK THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY LOOK  BAD ULTIMATELY.
BECAUSE OF USING THAT LANGUAGE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS HAVING COUNTRIES FACING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL PROBLEMS  FINDING WAYING HOW CAN THEY USE THE DOLLARS THEY SPEND ON DEFENSE SMARTER THAN THEY DID  BEFORE HAND.
THE HYPOTHETICAL COUNTRIES HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS --  [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WOULD THAT INCLUDE ANYBODY.
ALL 28.
Jon: IS ANYBODY GOING TO RAISE THEIR HAND AND SAY I DON'T  KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT?
THE NORWEGIANS TURN OUT -- THEY HAVE A LOT OF OIL. THEY ARE DOING QUITE WELL AND INCREASING DEFENSE SPENDING, ONE OF FEW COUNTRIES THAT IS.
Jon: WHY?
THEY THINK IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE ALLIANCE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.
Jon: THEY THINK IT'S TIME TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY THINK IT'S TIME TO GET A STANDING ARMY AND SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH.
THAT WOULD BAY CHALLENGE FOR A COUNTRY OF FOUR MILLION PEOPLE BUT NEVERTHELESS --
Jon: I'LL HAVE A GOOD AT THAT.
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY PERHAPS.
Jon: RUSSIA HAS MADE SOME NOISE ABOUT PREEMPTIVELY STRIKE STRIKING OUR MISSILE SHIELD. ARE YOU NERVOUS AT ALL THAT RUSSIA IS GOING TO START A WAR WITH NATO? OR IS THAT TOO SERIOUS A QUESTION TO ASK AND ANSWER FROM ME?
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. I'M NOT NERVOUS ABOUT IT. THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUSSIA AND NATO ABOUT MISSILE DEFENSE. BOTH PRESIDENTS WANT TO RESOLVE THAT THROUGH DIALOG. WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON FOR RUSSIA TO BE AAFRAID OF HAVING DEFENSIVELY  CAPABILITIES DEPLOYED IN EUROPE DESIGNED TO DEFEND EUROPE AGAINST A THREAT FROM OUTSIDE  EUROPE, NOT RUSSIA. THERE'S NO REASON TO PREEMPT.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THIS THROUGH DIALOG, DOES ANYTHING NOT THAT  SAY THAT? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANYBODY WOULD SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THIS BY BOMBING YOU? SEEMS LIKE THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY LAY IT OUT LIKE THAT.
THAT'S TRUE BUT THERE WERE TIMES IN THE ALLIANCE WHEN THERE  WAS NO DIALOGS WITH THE RUSSIANS OR SOVIETS, AS THEY USES TO BE CALLED, WHERE WE DIDN'T DO ANY  TALKING, WE HAD MUCH BIGGER ARMS READY TO STRIKE. IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.
Jon: WHO WATCHES BRAZIL'S ASS? [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE'S A -- THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES WHICH WE ARE  ONE OF MEMBERS AS A TREATY NOT UNLIKE THE TREATY SIGNED IN WASHINGTON IN 1949 BUT IT ISN'T  QUITE THE SAME THING. THIS IS THE ONLY MILITARY ALLIANCE WHERE 28 COUNTRIES HAVE AN INTEGRATED MILITARY COMMAND  STRUCTURE SO THAT IF THERE'S A NEED TO USE FORCE THEY CAN MAKE THAT DECISION QUICKLY AND MOVE  FORWARD AND USE FORCE QUICKLY AS YOU SAW IN LIBYA LAST YEAR.
Jon: FASCINATING STUFF. BEFORE WE GO, WHO ARE WE ATTACKING NEXT? [ LAUGHTER ] JUST BLINK -- I'LL SAY A COUNTRY AND YOU BLINK IF. -- IF I AM RIGHT. NORWAY. BOOM WE'RE GOING IN. AMBASSADOR IVO DAALDER.
