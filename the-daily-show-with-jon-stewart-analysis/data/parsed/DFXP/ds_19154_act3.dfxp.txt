Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE WAS RECENTLY A DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE IN NEW YORK. SHE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT FORDHAM UNIVERSITY, HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "CORRUPTION IN AMERICA: FROM BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S SNUFF BOX TO CITIZENS UNITED." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ZEPHYR TEACHOUT. HELLO!  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I WANT TO TALK -- SO THE BOOK HERE, CORRUPTION, HERE'S THE SURPRISE, IN AMERICA. I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. YOU, THIS IS A REAL CORE ISSUE FOR YOU.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU HAVE STUDIED THIS, YOU GET INVOLVED IN THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE IN NEW YORK AS AN UTTER UNKNOWN. AND THROUGH THE FORCE OF THIS ISSUE, THROUGH THE FORCE OF PUTTING IT IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS YOU NEARLY OVERTURN WHAT WAS A GUBERNATORIAL DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY THAT WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A CORONATION BEFORE YOU ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.
YEAH, WE ACTUALLY WON OVER HALF THE COUNTIES IN NEW YORK STATE. AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S REALLY BASIC. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WANT POLITICIANS WHO FIGHT FOR THEM. AND THEY DON'T WANT POLITICIANS WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR BIG MONEY. I MEAN, THAT'S THE CORE ISSUE HERE.
Jon: AND SO THE DIFFICULTY THEN BECOMES HOW DO YOU SEPARATE THE TWO? AND HAS MONEY BECOME SO ENTRENCHED THAT IT'S NOW THE AIR THAT THEY BREATHE AND THE FOOD THAT THEY EAT.
WELL, IT IS TOO CLOSE TO BEING THAT ENTRENCHED. BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I MEAN, EVEN OUR CAMPAIGN SHOWS THAT WE ARE NOT THERE YET. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE IN POLITICS WHO ARE, YOU KNOW, FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. BUT IT'S SO TEMPTING TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT NET. IF YOU ARE SPENDING HALF YOUR TIME FUND-RAISING.
Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN THAT'S WHO YOU ARE.
Jon: RIGHT. DID YOU HAVE TO, TO LAUNCH HERE AS A POPULIST CAMPAIGN, HOW MUCH OF IT DID EVEN YOU HAVE TO INVOLVE YOURSELF IN?
WELL, AT THE BEGINNING, I MEAN, WE WERE JUST DIGGING AROUND THE DIRT FOR PENNIES. LIKE I WAS SPENDING ALL DAY CALLING PEOPLE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SAYING, YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE HAVE A CHANCE HERE. THERE'S AN ANGLE. AND IT'S HARD AND IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF, IT'S NOT WHO WE WANT TO BE AS PEOPLE.
SURE.
TO CALL.
Jon: BUT IF, SO LET'S SAY IN THAT SITUATION, A BILLIONAIRE FINANCER OR A BIG UNION COMES BY AND THEY SAY TO YOU I HAVE A LARGE BAG...
RIGHT.
Jon: IT HAS A DOLLAR SIGN PAINTED ON IT.
YEAH.
Jon: I COULD DROP IT OFF TO YOU. IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO RESIST THAT. AND WE EVEN HAD A FEW MOMENTS LIKE THAT. I MEAN TO BE HONEST, I WOULD TALK TO PEOPLE I CARE A LOT ABOUT, PUBLIC ED. I CARE A LOT ABOUT-- YOU KNOW, I SUPPORT TEACHERS UNIONS. AND WE HAD PEOPLE REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF MY CAMPAIGN WHO HAD MORE MONEY. BUT WEREN'T AS EXCITED ABOUT TEACHERS' UNIONS. AND SO WE WOULD HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS NEVER THIS EXPLICIT DEAL.
Jon: RIGHT.
OR MAYBE IT IS SOMETIMES.
Jon: BUT ISN'T THAT HOW IT TO YOU BEING DENIED.
YES. YEAH. WELL..
Jon: THE SUPREME COURT IS DEFINING IT AS TRUE QUID PRO -- CORRUPTION IS ONLY QUID PRO QUO.
RIGHT.
I GIVE YOU THIS MONEY IF YOU PROMISE ME YOU WILL DO THIS.
YEAH, I MEAN, THE SUPREME COURT, I THINK, IS JUST SO OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELL, UNFORTUNATELY THERE SEEMS TO BE NO SUPPORT FOR THAT SENTIMENT. BUT NO, CONTINUE. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THERE ARE, AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AND I MEAN, THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT. IS THAT, NOT ONLY DOES IT NOT MAKE SENSE NOW, BUT YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT AMERICAN HISTORY FOR THE FIRST 200 YEARS WHEN YOU SAID CORRUPTION, PEOPLE THOUGHT, INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT, OH, YOU MEAN ALL THE KINDS OF WAYS IN WHICH MONEY CAN BASICALLY TEMPT PUBLIC, YOU KNOW, POLITICIANS AWAY FROM SERVING THE PUBLIC. AND IT'S NOT JUST IN BRIBES...
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S INCLUDING IN LEGAL WAYS. AND THE SUPREME COURT NOW SAYS IT IS ONLY IF BASICALLY I WRITE YOU A CONTRACT SAYING JOHN, WILL YOU PLEASE MENTION, YOU KNOW, CREST TOOTHPASTE, OR WHATEVER, IN THIS OR THAT.
Jon: I WOULD NEVER-- ALTHOUGH IT DOES REALLY POLISH TEETH. SO WHY THIS CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU SORT OF CHART IT FROM BEN FRANKLIN'S SNUFF BOX THAT HE RECEIVES FROM FRANCE WITH DIAMONDS IN IT.
YEAH.
Jon: AND HOW THAT REGISTERED AS CORRUPTION BACK IN THE DAY. AND HOW THIS SUPREME COURT HAS NARROWED THAT DEFINITION.
YEAH, I REALLY try -- I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. LIKE HOW DID THEY GET SO OUT TO LUNCH ON THIS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I THINK SOME OF IT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POLITICIANS ON THE COURT ANY MORE. THAT MAY SEEM SORT OF PERVERSE. BUT LIKE TAFT...
Jon: RIGHT.
NOW TAFT UNDERSTOOD MONEY AND POLITICS. SO WHEN A MONEY AND POLITICS CASE CAME TO HIM HE SAID WE HAVE A REAL THREAT OF CORRUPTION RIGHT HERE. AND RIGHT NOW THE MODERN COURT IS MOSTLY ACADEMICS AND APPELLATE COURT JUSTICES. I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT. PART OF IT IS THEY DON'T ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT, THEY'RE NOT MAKING THEIR DECISIONS BASED ON FACTS. JUST-- BUT NO, BUT --
SURE, OKAY.
BUT IN CITIZEN'S UNITED AND IN McCUTCHEN, THESE TWO RECENT CASES, THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T BUILD, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE CALL A RECORD. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO CONGRESS MEMBERS TALK, LISTEN TO POLITICIANS TALK. BECAUSE IF YOU TALK TO POLITICIANS THEY WILL ALL TELL YOU WHAT IS WRONG.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT THAT'S THE POINT. YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT, BACKSTAGE, THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF HAVING TO SPEND FOUR TO SIX HOURS A DAY FUND-RAISING, FORGET ABOUT THE QUID PRO QUO OF WHAT THEY MAY WANT YOU TO DO. HOW DOES ONE GOVERN, HOW DOES ONE DO THEIR JOB WHEN SO OF OF THEIR JOB IS SPENT SEARCHING FOR MONEY.
IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO. AND THE OTHER PART OF YOUR JOB AS A POLITICIAN IS TO LISTEN. IS TO SORT OF BEAR WITNESS TO PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEN LEAD AND THEN LEARN FROM THAT. AND THERE'S NO TIME FOR THAT AND FUND-RAISING AND GOVERNING. AND THESE ARE ALL PARTS OF, YOU KNOW, THE INITIAL AMERICAN IDEA, WHICH I'M VERY ATTACHED TO.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WE CAN DO THINGS ABOUT IT.
Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE SEGUE. WHY DON'T I THROW TO COMMERCIAL, AND THEN WHEN WE COME BACK ON THE WEB, YOU WILL TELL US WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM AT TIMES, YOU KNOW, I THINK PEOPLE LOSE HEART. I THINK THEY SEE THAT EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT THEY REALLY RESPECT AND THEY REALLY LOVE FALL PREY TO THIS LARGE MONEY INFLUENCE.
YEAH.
Jon: SO WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. THE BOOK GIVES AN INCREDIBLY DETAILED AND I THINK VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE SITUATION. "CORRUPTION IN AMERICA," IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, ZEPHYR TEACHOUT.
