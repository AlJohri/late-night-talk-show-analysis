CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH  JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BOOM! LISTEN, FOR THE NEXT-- THANK  YOU VERY MUCH, FOR THE NEXT  22 MINUTES OR SO I WILL BE THE HOST OF THIS DAMN  PROGRAM. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT, YOU  KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF  IMPORTANT STORIES IN THE  WORLD RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR  EVERYBODY, ONE OF THE MOST  IMPORTANT STORIES IS  HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
AN AMBITIOUS PLAN  ALLOWING NEW YORKERS TO  SHARE BIKES BEGINS TODAY IN  THE BIG APPLE. STARTS WITH 6,000 SHINE EYE  NEW BIKES STATIONED IN  MANHATTAN AN BROOKLYN. HALF HALF:  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: 6,000 SHINY NEW  BIKES, BY TOMORROW, 3,000,  YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELL, A BICYCLE SHARE,  THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA. WHERE DOES THAT IDEA COME  FROM.
THEY'RE ON THE STREETS OF  PARIS, BARCELONA AND  MONTREAL, AND NOW NEW YORK  CITY.
Jon: OH MY GOD! WE HAVE BASICALLY IMPORTED  EUROPE'S MOST BORING IDEA. (LAUGHTER)  YEAH, I GOT AN IDEA, WHY  DON'T YOU KEEP YOUR [BLEEP] LOUVRE AND WHATEVER YOUR  PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDE IS  TOWARDS SEXUAL FREEDOM, JUST  GIVE US YOUR [BLEEP] BIKE, THAT'S ALL WE WANT. WE WANT TO PEDAL AROUND A  LITTLE BIT AND SEE WHAT WE  CAN DO THERE. WE DON'T WANT YOUR HEALTH  CARE, WE JUST WANT THOSE [BLEEP]. FIRST OF ALL. THE IDEA OF NEW YORKERS  SHARING ANYTHING OTHER THAN  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED  DISEASES--  (LAUGHTER)
IS BACK ADO. -- WACKADOO. HOW DOES IT WORK.
THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED FOR  ANNUAL MEMBERS LAST WEEK  WITHOUT PAY $95 A YEAR FOR UNLIMITED 45 MINUTE RIDES.
Jon: RECEIPT ME STOP YOU  RIGHT THERE. WHAT IS AN UNLIMITED 45  MINUTE RIDE. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE  LIMIT IS 45 MINUTES. LIKE PROMISING THREE MINUTE  ETERNITY. LADIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DID I SAY 3, I WAS THINKING  OF THE METRIC SYSTEM, IT'S  REALLY ONLY-- I THINK IT TRANSLATES TO ONE AND A  HALF. BUT WHO KNOWS? THIS COULD BE GREATMENT  MAYBE THESE 6,000 NEW  BICYCLISTS ON MANHATTAN  STREETS EVERY DAY ARE MORE SKILLED AND SAVVY THAN WE  THINK. HOW'S IT GOING.
NOT EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO  RIDE. THAT'S WHY VOLUNTEERS ARE  RUNNING FREE WORKSHOPS LIKE  THIS ONE.
HELMETS ARE ENCOURAGED  BUT NOT REQUIRED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO DIE. (LAUGHTER)  NO, THAT SOUNDS-- SO THEY'RE  LEARNING HOW TO BIKE AND  THEY DON'T HAVE TO WEAR  HELMETS. WAIT A MINUTE, THAT GIVES ME  A MONEYMAKING IDEA. NO, NO, NO, I SAID  MONEYMAKING. YEAH! GRAY MAT CERTIFICATE NO  MATTER WHAT JOHNNIE SUE'S  STREET BRAIN REMOVAL  SERVICE. THE SECRET INGREDIENT IS A  MOP. BUT OF COURSE THIS BEING NEW  YORK CITY SOMEBODY'S GOT TO  HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.
BIKERS AND DRIVERS ALIKE  ADMIT THEY'RE NERVOUS WITH  THE SUDDEN INFLUX OF NOVICE RIDERS ON UNFAMILIAR  EQUIPMENT.
DOESN'T ACCEPT OUR CREDIT  CARDS.
WE WANT THE BICYCLE SHARE  PROGRAM BUT WE WANT IT LESS  HEAVY-HANDED PLACEMENT OF THESE RACKS.
Jon: OH, THEY'RE NOT  SAFE. DOESN'T WORK. IT LOOKS LIKE [BLEEP] BLAH,  BLAH, BLAH. YOU KNOW WE USED TO SAY THE  SAME THING ABOUT THE IRISH. AND LOOK AT THEM NOW! THEY'RE RUNNING THE JOINT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IF THERE HAD EVER BEEN  ANYBODY T WAS LIKE LOOK, I  LIKE THE IRISH, I JUST THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE  JUDICIOUS PLACEMENT. DOESN'T ANYBODY HAVE A REAL  OBJECTION?
DO NOT ASK ME TO ENTER  THE MIND OF THE  TOTALITARIANS RUNNING THIS  GOVERNMENT, OR THE CITY. THIS MEANS SOMETHING MUCH  MORE THAN THE SPECIFICS OF  THIS DREADFUL PROGRAM. IT MEANS, ENVISION WHAT  HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A  GOVERNMENT THAT IS RUN BY AN  AUTOCRATIC MAYOR OR OTHER LEADER AND A GOVERNMENT  BEFORE WHICH YOU WERE  HELPLESS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JUST [BLEEP] BIKES,  LADY. SLOW DOWN, LADY HUNGER GAMES. OR SHOULD I SAY PULITZER  PRIZE WINNING EDITORIAL  BOARD MEMBER OF THE "THE  WALL STREET JOURNAL". AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE? WHAT GROUP ARE YOU  SUGGESTING IS CONSPIRING TO  CRUSH THE WILL OF THE  PEOPLE.
THE BIKE LOBBY IS AN ALL  POWERFUL ENTERPRISE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AH, YES, BIG WHEELS. AND THEIR UNION SONS. DAMN YOU, FOZY BEAR. THE GOOD NEWS THE "THE WALL  STREET JOURNAL" FINALLY  RECOGNIZING THE CORROSIVE  EFFECT OF LOBBYING, THE BAD NEWS, IT'S THE BIKE LOBBY. COME ON, THERE ARE REAL  COMPLAINTS TO BE MADE AND TO  SEE IF THE PEOPLE OF NEW  YORK ARE WILLING TO MAKE THEM WE SENT AL OUT TO THE  STREETS TO MAKE THE CASE.
Reporter: WITH THE CITY  BIKE PROGRAM NOW NEARING THE  END OF ITS FIRST WEEK, DOR THEE IS ALL OVER THE CITY  ARE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST  THAT TYRANNICAL BIKE SHARE.
I THINK IT'S A DISASTER  FOR THE CITY.
I THINK IT'S A HAZARD.
I MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL  ACCIDENT. SOMEBODY PITE RIGHT OUT LIKE  THIS AND HIT ME OR SOMEONE  ELSE. AS A BIKE IS COMING OUT.
LET'S BE HONEST YOU ARE A  POTENTIAL ACCIDENT NO MATTER  WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND THE DAMAGE IS SURE TO  TAKE A FAR GREATER TOLL.
YOU HAVE AN HISTORIC  NEIGHBORHOOD BEING  DESECRATED BY THESE UGLY  BIKES.
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE  PROPERTY VALUES GOING DOWN  ON THESE THREE BUILDINGS IN FRONT OF WHICH --
I THINK THAT ONE WENT  FROM LIKE 22 MILLION DOWN TO  21 MILLION.
IT'S SAD.
HEARTBREAKING, EVEN. NOT TO MENTION THE BIKE  SHARE'S BIGGEST TRAGEDY OF  ALL.
THEY'RE TAKING WAY FROM  VALUABLE PARKING SPOTS.
AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR  OTHER CARS CAN COULD BE  THERE.
THE BIKES TAKE UP MORE  ROOM THAN THE HONDAS BECAUSE  THEY EXTEND INTO THE STREET.
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME  THING, RIGHT.
YEAH, WE ARE LOOKING AT  THE SAME THING. SO YOU MUST BE FOR THE  BIKES.
I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] EITHER WAY.
OKAY, WELL NEITHER DO I,  BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE HERE.
THE WRS PART IS MAYOR  BLOOMBERG COVERTLY PLANTED  THESE BIKE STATIONS WITH PRACTICALLY ZERO NOTICE.
ONE MORNING I WOKE UP,  THEY WERE HERE.
AWE AWFUL. THAT BLOOMBERG HAS DONE  THIS.
APART FROM THE 159  MEETINGS, HE DIDN'T SAY A  WORD.
OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS SOME  COMMUNITY OUTREACH BUT THEY  PUT THESE STATIONS DOWN WITHOUT ANY DUE PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON WEST FOURTH  STREET.
OKAY, WELL, EVEN THOUGH  THAT IS NOT TRUE, WHY IS IT?
YES, EVERYONE HATES CITY  BIKE, EVEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS  THAT DON'T HAVE IT.
LIKE BROOKLYN'S BEN.
WHERE CITY BIKE WHERE WE  REALLY NEED A CITY BOOK. AIN'T NO CITY BIKE IN THE  HOOD.
YOU ARE SAYING PEOPLE IN  YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD NEED THE  BIKES.
WE NEED THE BIKES.
WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE THE  SUBWAY.
THE J TRAIN, THE J TRAIN,  WHERE THE [BLEEP] AM I GOING  TO GO ON THE J TRAIN.
THEY GO ON-- LITTLE.
YOU KNOW-- [BLEEP] OWN  HOUSES IN THE FOURTH COURT  YOU KNOW WHAT WE OWN HERE, SPRAY CANS BLOEP [BLEEP] BLACK FLAG.
HE -- SEE HOW THE BIG KOS  RUIN HIS COMMUNITY.
THEY ARE AN EYESORE, IT  USED TO BE A BEAUTIFUL  HISTORIC NEIGHBORHOOD.
EYE SORE IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD. WE IN THE HOOD. THEM PRETTY BLUE ASS BIKES  WOULD BENEFIT THEY WOULD  DECORATE THIS [BLEEP].
CERTAINLY SOMEONE MUST  HAVE A SOLUTION.
IF ONLY BLOOMBERG COULD  COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATE  FORM OF TRANSPORTATION, SOMETHING THAT WAS  CONVENIENT FOR ALL THE  CITIZENS TO SORT OF CHECK  OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN  RENT A HORSE.
THE ONLY THING I CAN  THINK OF IS SMALLER CARS,.
FINI CARS.
TINY CARS MAYBE ELECTRIC  CARS.
TINY ELECTRIC CARS.
LIKE THE GOLF CARTS.
WHILE THE HOOD WAITS ON  THOSE GOLF CARTS, THEY'LL  JUST HAVE TO MAKE DUE.
KEEP IT UP, KEEP  THAT-- YEAH, THERE YOU GO,  THAT'S HOW DO YOU A CITY  BIKE-- CITY BIKE.
