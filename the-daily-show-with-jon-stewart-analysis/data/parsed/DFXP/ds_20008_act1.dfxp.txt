FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "THE DAILY SHOW"" WITH JON STEWART." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT-- IT'S A GOOD ONE-- JEREMY RENNER. JEREMY RENNER IS GOING TO BE HERE FROM THE NEW FILM "KILL THE MESSENGER." MAN, IS IT A GOOD STORY. BUT FIRST, REMEMBER THE BIG FINANCIAL CRISIS, 2008? ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER IT YOU WEREN'T THERE, MAN. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS WOODSTOCK. ANYWAY, IT TANKED THE ECONOMY. WELL, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU GOT GOOD AND ANGRY ABOUT IT? WANT TO? ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT. YOU ASKED FOR IT. REMEMBER HOW WE GIFT WRAPPED $184 BILLION TO INSURANCE GIANT A.I.G. TO PURCHASE THAT COMPANY'S TERRIBLE MORTGAGE BETS SO THAT THEIR INCOMPETENCE WOULDN'T BECOME A GLOBAL EXTINCTION EVENT? ( LAUGHTER ). WE JUST GOT THE THANK YOU NOTE.
FORMER AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP CHIEF HANK GREENBERG IS SUING THE ARCHITECTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE FINANCIAL PANIC OF 2008?
HE CLAIMS THE BAILOUT VIOLATED SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS.
Jon:  REALLY! ( LAUGHTER ) SO JUST TO SET THE TABLE FOR YOU HERE, THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER OF A.I.G., WASN'T RUNNING IT AT THE TIME WAS JUST THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER, A COMPANY THAT WAS HOURS AWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY IS SUING THE ENTITY THAT THROUGH SHEER FORCE OF $184 BILLION SAVED IT-- OR-- LET ME PUT IT ANOTHER WAY. YEAH, YOU GAVE ME C.P.R., BUT WOULD IT KILL YOU TO TAKE A BREATH MINT? ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT IF ANY IS THE LEGAL BASIS FOR HANK GREENBERG'S CLAIM.
HANK GREENBERG AND HIS INVESTMENT FIRM STAR INTERNATIONAL CHARGING THE GOVERNMENT VIOLATED A.I.G.'S FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS BY CHARGING IT HIGH INTEREST RATES ON LOANS AND BY NOT COMPENSATING THEM PROPERLY FOR TAKING WHAT BECAME A 92% STAKE IN THE COMPANY.
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE PROPERTY WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT.
Jon:  YOU CAN'T! ( LAUGHTER ) I THINK $184 BILLION IS PAYING FOR IT! LOOK, ALL RIGHT, SO HE BELIEVES $184 BILLION WAS NOT WORTH 92% OF THE COMPANY. IT WAS UNFAIRLY LOW. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE A DICK-- HE MAY BE RIGHT. LOOK, LET'S CHECK THE-- LET'S CHECK THE BLUE BOOK VALUE FOR A TOXIC ASSET-FILLED INSURANCE COMPANY FROM 2008 ON THE DAY OF THE BAILOUT. AND IF WE PUT ONE OVER ON YOU, MR. GREENBERG, IF WE TREATED YOU UNFAIRLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S OUR BAD AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO APOLOGIZE AND WRITE YOU A CHECK FOR HOWEVER MANY BILLIONS MORE YOU HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY DEPRIVED OF. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THE MATH. WE GAVE $184.6 BILLION IN EXCHANGE FOR 92% OF A.I.G. SO THAT MEANS WE ARE VALUING THE COMPANY AROUND $200 BILLION. SO NOW I'M ALL -- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BECAUSE NOW I'M THINKING TO MYSELF HOW MUCH MORE THAN $200 BILLION WAS THIS COMPANY WORTH WHEN THE BAILOUT BEGAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO OWE THIS GUY. SO, HERE WE GO. WHAT WAS IT WORTH? $15.4 BILLION. ALL RIGHT. HMM. HMM. ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE PAID YOU 92% OF $15.4 BILLION, WE PAID YOU $184 BILLION OR MORE THAN 1,000% OF YOUR COMPANY'S MARKET VALUE. SO I CAN SEE WHERE YOUR ANGER COMES FROM. ( LAUGHTER ) EXPLAIN TO ME AGAIN WHY YOU'RE IN COURT?
TODAY A LAWYER FOR A.I.G.'S FORMER CHIEF SAID THE TERMS OF THE BAILOUT WERE EXTORTION. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  AS A GENERAL RULE, YOUR BETTER EXTORTIONISTS, YOUR BETTER KIDNAPPERS EXTRACT MONEY FROM THEIR VICTIMS. ( LAUGHTER ) RATHER THAN CONTRIBUTE. YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER HEAR THIS-- HEY, LISTEN, IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE YOUR PRECIOUS LITTLE DOGGY AGAIN, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THE $184 BILLION AND ONCE YOU GET THE MONEY, WE WILL ALSO GIVE YOU YOUR DOG BACK. NO COPS! ( LAUGHTER ) THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO TELL THEM NOT TO HAVE THE COPS COME. IF ANYTHING, THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM EXTORTED THE TAXPAYERS BY SCREWING UP SO ROYALLY THE WORLD WOULD BE ON THE BRINK OF FINANCIAL APOCALYPSE WITHOUT THE BAILOUT. WE WERE THE ONES WITHOUT A CHOICE. BUT YOU PREFER TO PAINT YOURSELF AS A VALIANT CRUSADER AGAINST GOVERNMENT TYRANNY.
WHAT'S THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM LIKE? WHAT DO WE BELIEVE IN? WE BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE WHAT THEY WANT AND YOU JUST SHUT UP AND EAT YOUR RICE? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WELL, I DON'T EAT RICE! UNLESS IT'S A TRUFFLE RISOTTO. I LIKE A NICE RISOTTO! LOOK, HANK GREENBERG, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A GRUMPY OLD MAN, LET'S NOT PRETEND THIS IS UP. WHERE YOU'RE SOME-- ( LAUGHTER ) WHERE YOU'RE SOME SAD OLD WIDOWER BEING FORCED INTO A NURSING HOME SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY YOUR BELOVED BALLOON-FILLED HOUSE AND TURN IT INTO A SKYSCRAPER. WE ALL KNOW WHAT CARTOON CHARACTER YOU ARE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) LISTEN, YOU GOT ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS OR CAN I JUST DISMISS THIS CASE RIGHT NOW?
HE IS ARGUING THAT A.I.G. GOT MUCH HARSHER TERMS, ABOUT 14% INTEREST RATE ON THEIR LOAN. THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM BANKS LIKE CITIGROUP OR MORGAN STANLEY.
THEY WERE GETTING MORE GENEROUS TERMS. THAT IN AND OF ITSELF PROVES THE GOVERNMENT WENT TOO FAR WITH A.I.G. AT LEAST THAT'S THE ARGUMENT HANK GREENBERG AND HIS LAWYERS ARE MAKING.
Jon:  SO YOUR ARGUMENT IN COURT, YOUR LEGAL ARGUMENT IS WAAAAH! ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S NOT FAIR! FOLLOWING THE PRECEDENT SET BY THE FAMOUS SUPREME COURT CASE I ONLY GOT ONE COOKIE V. MY SISTER GOT TWO COOKIES. COME ON! ( LAUGHTER ) SACK UP! LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN TWO COOKIIES IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOUR ONE COOKIE IS NOTHING. YOUR LOAN TERMS WERE WORSE THAN THE BANKS' BECAUSE YOU WERE INSOLVENT. YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW THAT WORKS. YOU'RE AN INSURANCE COMPANY. ( LAUGHTER ) PUTTING THE SCREWS TO PEOPLE IN THEIR LOWEST MOMENTS IS WHAT YOU DO. SO THE ESSENCE OF GREENBERG'S ARGUMENT APPEARS TO BE THE BANKS GOT SPECIAL TREATMENT THAT A.I.G. DID NOT GET, TO WHICH I SAY WELCOME TO THE ( BLEEP ) WORLD, BUDDY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN MAD ABOUT FOREVER! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) REALLY? YOU'RE ANGRY THAT THEY WOULDN'T LEND TO YOU AT LESS THAN 14%. YEAH. WE HATE IT, TOO, ONLY WE CALL IT HAVING A CREDIT CARD. AND WE DON'T SUE OVER THOSE RATES BECAUSE WE CAN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DID STILL GET SPECIAL TREATMENT. $184 BILLION FOR 92% OF A ( BLEEP ) COMPANY IS SPECIAL TREATMENT. IT JUST WASN'T AS SPECIAL AS YOU WANTED IT TO BE. THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE SUING THE GOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE THEY GAVE YOU A SEAT IN FIRST CLASS BUT NOT THE ELITE PLATINUM NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THIS PART OF THE PLANE, BUT IT'S AWESOME, BECAUSE WE HAVE A JACUZZI UP HERE SECTION. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW-- HOW THE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED IN A.I.G.'S SHOES. IT'S IN A LITTLE ONE-MAN SHOW I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ENTITLED "A NORMAL PERSON ASKS FOR A LOAN." ( LAUGHTER ) I TAKE YOU NOW TO ANYTOWN, U.S.A. WHERE THE LOCAL LOAN OFFICER-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WINK. I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS GOING TO WORK. IN REHEARSAL DIDN'T WORK. I COME BACK OUT HERE, IT WORKS. EDISON! ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ) OH, HELLO, MR. GREENBERG. OH PRESCRIPTION. OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'VE ASKED US FOR $184.6 BILLION FOR 90% OF YOUR COMPANY WHICH IS ONLY WORTH $15 BILLION. HOLD ON. ( LAUGHTER ) AH! AH! GO ( BLEEP ) YOURSELF. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
