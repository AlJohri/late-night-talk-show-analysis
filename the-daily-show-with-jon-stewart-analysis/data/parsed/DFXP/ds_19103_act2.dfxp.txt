Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO LIGHTEN THINGS UP. WE'RE GOING TO GET IT GOING, WE'RE GOING TO LIGHTEN THINGS UP WITH OUR NEW SEGMENT WOW! DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. FIRST UP, MICHAEL SAM BECOMES THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYER DRAFTED BY AN NFL TEAM ON SATURDAY. TRULY A LANDMARK MOMENT FOR THE NFL, AN AMAZING MOMENT FOR THE GAY COMMUNITY AND BOY, IS HE CLOSE TO HIS AGENT. HE REALLY-- JUST THERE'S-- WHAT'S THAT? I'M BEING TOLD THAT IS HIS BOYFRIEND? WHAT AN INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT. I JUST KNOW THE NFL A PLACE WHERE MEN HUG EACH OTHER PROFESSIONALLY WILL WELCOME HIM WITH OPEN ARMS.
THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYER DRAFTED BY THE NFL KISSED HIS BOYFRIEND, SPARKING SOME HATEFUL TWEETS FROM FORMER HOUSTON TEXTAN AND NEW YORK GIANT DEREK WARD, FOR HIM TO DO THAT ON NATIONAL TV IS DISGUSTING.
MAN, YOU GOT LITTLE KIDS LOOKING AT THE DRAFT.
YES, GOD FORBID KIDS LOOK ON THE TV AND SEE TWO MEN WHO CLEARLY LOVE CAKE, TWO MEN WHO CANNOT GET ENOUGH SWEET, SWEET CAKE. (LAUGHTER) OH NO. TWO DUDES FILLING EACH OTHER'S MOUTHS. (LAUGHTER) WITH CAKE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE NEXT ITEM I TOTALLY DID NOT SEE COMING, AN OLD CRINKY RACIST APOLOGIZING FOR HATE SPEECH.
DONALD STERLING SPEAKING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME. STERLING SAYS HIS OWN WORDS LEAVE HIM BEWILDERED. AND HE'S NOT A RACIST.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I COULD SAY WORDS LIKE THAT. AND I'M SO SORRY. AND I'M SO APOLOGETIC.
Jon: THAT WAS CLIPPER'S OWNER DONALD STERLING TAKING BACK HIS WORDS OF INTOLERANCE, AS WELL AS REMINDING US WHAT THE COWARDLY LION LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT MAKEUP. NOW -- I'M SORRY, I SHOULDN'T DO THAT IT'S A MEAN THING TO SAY. HE ADMITTED HE WAS AT FAULT AND IT'S TIME WE PUT THIS AWFUL BUSINESS BEHIND US.
I'M APOLOGIZING AND I'M ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS. AM I ENTITLED TO ONE MISTAKE, AFTER 35 YEARS?
Jon: WELL-- IT'S NOT ONE MISTAKE. THERE ARE-- IN CASE YOU FORGOT, YOU WERE ALREADY THE SUBJECT OF WHAT WAS AT THE TIME THE LARGEST APARTMENT DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT IN U.S. HISTORY WHERE YOU WERE ACCUSED OF SAYING BLACK PEOPLE SMELL BAD. AND MY GUESS IS THAT WAS REALLY YOUR ONE MISTAKE CHIP. OR WAS THAT MORE OF A SNAFU, A BOO-BOO PERHAPS. BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY NOW.
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WERE SET UP.
WELL, YES, I WAS BAITED. I MEAN, IT'S NOT THE WAY I TALK. I DON'T TALK ABOUT PEOPLE FOR ONE THING, EVER. I TALK ABOUT IDEAS AND OTHER THINGS. BUT I DON'T TALK ABOUT PEOPLE.
Jon: I'M AN IDEAS MAN. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S AN -- NO WAIT -- HERE'S AN IDEA THAT I'VE BEEN KICK AROUND LATELY. WHAT IF -- WHAT IF -- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN -- WHAT IF PARKS HAD TWO WATER FOUNTAINS INSTEAD OF ONE? WAIT, WAIT, I GOT ONE. I'M AN IDEAS GUY.  I JUST CAME UP WITH THIS ON THE FLY. I CAME UP WITH THIS, YOU KNOW HOW CROSSES ARE HARD TO SEE AT NIGHT. WHAT IF WE LIT THEM UP? WHAT IF WE LIT THEM UP? I HAVE A GREAT IDEA FOR A FOOTBALL TEAM, NO IT'S TOO MUCH. I WOULDN'T. IT'S A LITTLE RACIST. SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, IF YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, WHO IS?
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE GIRL HAD ME SAY THOSE THINGS.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHY THE GIRL HAD ME SAY THOSE-- I WAS JUST READING A PART IN A NEW-- IT'S A NEW SITCOM [BLEEP] MY OLD RACIST SUGAR DADDY SAYS. (LAUGHTER) WELL NOW THAT YOU HAVE DEFINITELY SHIFTED ALL OF THE BLAME ON TO THIS WOMAN AND PAINTED YOURSELF AS AN INNOCENT BUTTERSCOTCH LOVING GRAND PAPA, I'M SURE FROM NOW ON YOU WILL BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY.
THE ONLY ONE THAT I KNOW THAT I TALK TO IS MAGIC JOHNSON. HE IS A GOOD PERSON-- HE-- WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY. HAS HE DONE EVERYTHING HE CAN DO TO HELP MINORITIES? I DON'T THINK SO.
Jon: I LOVE THAT MOMENT WHERE STERLING IS CLEARLY THINKING-- SHOULD I SAY SOMETHING AWFUL AGAIN? (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY NOT? WHAT THE HELL, [BLEEP] MAGIC JOHNSON. (APPLAUSE) HERE'S WHAT IS SO CRAZY ABOUT THIS GUY. I'M STARTING TO THINK THIS WHOLE SECRETLY RECORDING DONALD STERLING AND THEN LEAKING IT TO THE MEDIA THING IS AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU CAN PUT HIM IN FRONT OF CAMERAS WHERE HE CAN SEE THEM WITH LOTS OF LIGHTS AND GO, SO, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? (LAUGHTER) AND LET THE CRAZY FLY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
