FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BONJOUR! WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. YOU KNOW WHO'S ON THE SHOW TONIGHT THERE? PROFESSOR X, AND YOU MAY THINK TO YOURSELF OH -- PATRICK STEWART. NO! JAMES MCAVOY IS PROFESSOR X. I JUST BLEW YOUR [BLEEP] MIND. (LAUGHTER) YOU MAY REMEMBER, A FEW WEEKS AGO ON THE PROGRAM, DO YOU WATCH THE PROGRAM? (LAUGHTER) A FEW WEEKS AGO, OR YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN WATCHING BASKETBALL. WE ADDRESSED A MINOR INCIDENT IN OUR OTHERWISE SPOTLESS DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. SOMETHING ABOUT THE PHOENIX VA WORKERS FALSIFYING PATIENT WAITING LISTS SO THAT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE VETERANS HAD LONG WAITS BEFORE SEEING DOCTORS. BUT THEY REALLY DID HAVE LONG WAITS. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A GOOD SYSTEM GIVE OR TAKE A COUPLE OF SCORES OF VETERANS IT MAY HAVE KILLED. I GOT SO MAD THAT I SCREAMED INTO THIS JAR. IT IS A SWEAR JAR THAT I WOULD SCREAM INTO. IT'S PRETTY FULL NOW, UNFORTUNATELY. LET ME JUST-- [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER) [BLEEP].
Jon: I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A THREE SYLLABLE ONE, I DON'T KNOW. WELL, GOOD NEWS, ACCORDING TO VA SECRETARY ERIC SHINSEKI'S CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY LAST WEEK, MY VA SWEAR JAR DAYS ARE OVER.
ARE PEOPLE QUOTE, UNQUOTE, COOK THE BOOKS? IS THAT IN FACT A PROBLEM WITHIN THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM?
I AM NOT AWARE AND OTHER THAN A NUMBER OF ISOLATED CASES WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THAT.
Jon: ISOLATED CASES, QUARANTINED. SO THAT MAKES ME FEEL MUCH BETTER, UNLESS, AND I THINK THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, A NEWS REPORT WOULD AIR, I DON'T KNOW, THE EXACT SAME DAY THAT SHINSEKI WAS TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS, UNLESS A NEWS REPORT LIKE THAT SAYS OTHERWISE.
IT'S ALLEGED THAT VA HOSPITALS IN AT LEAST EIGHT STATES WERE HIDING VETERANS APPOINTMENTS ON SECRET LISTS TO IMPROVE HOSPITAL RECORDS ON WAIT TIMES.
OH.
Jon: AT LEAST EIGHT STATES. HUH -- [BLEEP] [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IS BALLS REALLY A SWEAR WORD? IS THAT-- I REALLY JUST COULD, I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW HOW BALLS GOT IN THERE, QUITE FRANKLY. ACTUALLY, I DO NOW HOW BALLS GOT IN THERE. (LAUGHTER) SO GENERAL SHINSEKI, BY ISOLATED YOU MEANT THAT THE PROBLEM OF INADEQUATE VETERAN HEALTH CARE WAS ISOLATED TO VETERANS. WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE SENIOR VA MANAGEMENT IN 2010 SENT A MEMO WARNING REGIONAL VA DIRECTORS ABOUT INAPPROPRIATE PRACTICES DESIGNED TO MAKE WAITING LISTS LOOK SHORTER, EXCEPT THEY DID. OR THAT CBS NEWS OBTAINED ANOTHER MEMO FROM A VA HOSPITAL EXPLICITLY OUTLINING HOW AND WHY COLLEAGUES SHOULD GAME THE WAITING LIST.
IF WE EXCEED THE 14 DAY MEASURE FOR SCHEDULING APPOINTMENTS, HE SAYS, THE FRONT OFFICE GETS VERY UPSET. HE OUTLINED A WAY TO GET AROUND IT. WHEN PATIENTS CALLED FOR AN APPOINTMENT THEY WERE NOT BOOKED INTO THE COMPUTER UNTIL AN APPOINTMENT CAME UP NO LATER THAN 14 DAYS AWAY. THAT WAY THE MEMO SAYS YOU GET OFF THE BAD BOY'S LIST.
Jon: OH JESUS. BALLS! YES, YOU WOULD GET OFF THE VA'S BAD BOY LIST. BUT THERE'S THIS OTHER LIST. PERHAPS WRITTEN MORE INDELIBLY. NO. I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF THE BIG BOOK OF ASSHOLES -- BY THE WAY THE GUY ON THE COVER THERE, WE GOOGLED IMAGES OF ASSHOLES AND THAT'S LIKE, THAT'S LIKE THE STOCK PHOTO THAT CAME UP. SO I APOLOGIZE TO WHOEVER JUST THOUGHT SURE, I'LL FIX MY HAIR, WHY NOT. GENERAL SHINSEKI ANYTHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THIS LATEST INSULT TO OUR NATION'S VETERANS?
ANY ADVERSE INCIDENT LIKE THIS MAKES ME AS-- MAKES ME MAD AS HELL.  I COULD USE STRONGER LANGUAGE SURE, MR. CHAIRMAN. BUT IN DEFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE I WON'T.
NO I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE USE OF STRONGER LANGUAGE. PERHAPS I CAN OFFER YOU SOMETHING. LET'S DIP INTO THE JAR AND SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT. MOTHER [BLEEP] [BLEEP].
YEAH MOTHER [BLEEP] [BLEEP] DOES SEEM APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW, I THINK GENERAL SHINSEKI, SINCE YOU'VE HEADED UP THE VA SINCE 2009, FIVE YEARS INTO YOUR TENURE MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO RACHET UP THE VOCABULARY OR PERHAPS EVEN USE SOME NONVERBAL SIGNS TO BETTER CONVEY THE ANGER YOU SAY YOU FEEL BUT CAN'T USE APPARENTLY TO GET RESULTS. BECAUSE YOU DON'T LOOK MAD.  FOR INSTANCE, A CAT MIGHT PIN HIS EARS BACK. A HARP SEAL MIGHT RAISE UP ON ITS, WHATEVER THAT THING IS THAT IT'S RAISING UP ON. BUT A HUMAN, A HUMAN MIGHT MOVE THEIR LIPS OR FACE. YOUR'S MAD AS HELL FACE LOOKS A LOT LIKE YOUR OH WE'RE OUT OF ORANGE JUICE FACE. (LAUGHTER) MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE A PAGE OUT OF AUSTRALIAN DESCRIBING DOG INTERACTION GUY.
THEY CAME BOUNDING OVER --
NOW THAT GUY GETS THINGS DONE. NOW OF COURSE. MOTHER [BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP] THERE'S APPARENTLY A LEAK. NOW SHINSEKI IS ALSO THOUGH NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS VERY ANGRY.
THE PRESIDENT IS MADDER THAN HELL AND I HAVE GOT THE SCARS TO PROVE IT.
OH, YEAH, NO, I'M SURE THE STORY OF HOW YOU GOT THOSE SCARS WILL REALLY IMPRESS THE GUYS WAITING AT THE VA FOR TREATMENT. OH, LOST A LEG THERE TO AN IED IN FALLUJAH. WELL, I GOT THIS WHEN SOME SPITTLE HIT ME IN THE EYEBROW SO-- YEAH. NOW OF COURSE THIS TYPE OF BUREAUCRATIC TRAUMA RUNS DEEP. THE ANGER AND SADNESS GO BACK YEARS LIKE TO 2007 WHEN THE WALTER REED FILTHY AND NEGLIGENT VA HOSPITAL SCANDAL BROKE.
I WAS DISTURBED BY THEIR ACCOUNTS.
I LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS BOTH ANGERED AND OFFENDED.
SO, I SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THE DEPRESSION, THE IMPOTENT RAGE. OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS ARE CLEARLY SUFFERING FROM PBSD POST BUREAUCRATIC STRESS DISORDER. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEWHERE THEY COULD GET TREATMENT. WELL, IT'D PROBABLY BE A LONG WAITING LIST. IN FACT, WALTER REED WAS SUCH A BIG PROBLEM OUR PRESIDENT WAS ON IT BEFORE HE WAS EVEN PRESIDENT.
THEY COME HOME TO A NEW FRONT LINE OF RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY. AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF OUR FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO WHAT WE PROFESS TO HONOR AND THAT IS MILITARY SERVICE. AND I THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD WAY, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED BY IT.
YEAH, BUT THAT WAKE UP CALL WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO, BUT FOR SOME REASON WE JUST KEEP HITTING THE [BLEEP] SNOOZE BUTTON AND IT'S REALLY, HERE'S WHAT DISGUSTS ME. SOMEHOW WE AS A COUNTRY WERE ABLE TO SHIP 300,000 TROOPS HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD IN JUST A FEW MONTHS TO FIGHT A WAR THAT COST US $2 TRILLION, AN AMOUNT THAT DIDN'T COUNT TOWARDS OUR DEFICIT BECAUSE WE PAID FOR IT SOMEHOW UNDER THE TABLE. YET FOR SOME REASON IT TAKES LONGER THAN THAT TO GET SOMEONE HURT IN THAT WAR, NEEDED MEDICAL CARE OR REIMBURSEMENT. ALL WHILE WE PROFESS UNDYING LOVE FOR THEIR SERVICE.
I WANT EVERY VETERAN TO KNOW THAT AMERICA WILL ALWAYS HONOR YOUR SERVICE.
THEY SERVE AND SACRIFICE.
THE MOST HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN.
THE COURAGE AND COMMITMENT.
WE APPRECIATE YOU. WE LOVE YOU.
THE BEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
WE HAVE THE FINEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
SO IT'S CLEAR LOVE AND RESPECT AIN'T GETTING THE JOB DONE SO THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO PUT OUR GOVERNMENT'S FULL RESOURCES BEHIND ANYTHING. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE THE LIFE OF THESE VETERANS, I'M AFRAID WE HAVE TO DECLARE A WAR ON THEM. (LAUGHTER)
CONGRESS, WRITE A BLANK CHECK TO FUND OPERATION ENDURING WAIT LIST, A WAR ON ERROR. BECAUSE IF YOU WANT AMERICANS TO FEEL SHOCK AND AWE, YOU'LL FIX THIS [BLEEP] THING. [BLEEP] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
