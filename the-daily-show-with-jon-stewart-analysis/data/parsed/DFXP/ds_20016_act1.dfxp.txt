FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS, THE STATE WHOSE GOVERNOR THINKS PUTTING ON GLASSES MAKES YOU SMARTER, IT'S THE DAILY SHOW'S COVERAGE OF DEMOCALYPSE 2014. SOUTH BY SOUTH MESS, A LETHAL INJECTION OF DEMOCRACY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR FINAL SHOW HERE IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. WE'VE HAD AN INCREDIBLE TIME. WE'RE GOING TO FINISH OFF BIG. HOMETOWN FAVORITE BAND, SPOON, GOING TO BE JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO WE'VE BEEN DOWN HERE SINCE LAST WEEKEND. IT'S BEEN AMAZING, MAKING SHOWS DURING THE DAY, AND THEN AT NIGHT WE'VE BEEN RUNNING A TEX-MEX MUSTACHE-ERY. (LAUGHTER) I KNOW THOSE ARE A DIME A DOZEN AROUND HERE. (LAUGHTER) THIS IS, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS TOWN IS BLOWING MY MIND. I WALKED TO WORK TODAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS INTERESTING. YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE DID TO ME AS I WAS ON MY WAY HERE THIS MORNING? THEY SMILED. (LAUGHTER) AND THEY SAID, GOOD MORNING. (LAUGHTER) AND, BY THE WAY, NOT JUST TO ME, BUT TO, LIKE, EVERYBODY ON THE STREET. (LAUGHTER) AND I GUESS MY THOUGHT WAS, WHAT THE (BLEEP) WAS THAT? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LAST NIGHT, AARON FRANKLIN, LAST NIGHT A YOUNG MAN NAMED AARON FRANKLIN, FRANKLIN BBQ. HE CAME HERE, HE CATERED US A DINNER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE THE HYPE BUT LIKE, YOU GOT TO HAVE FRANKLIN, MAN, FRANKLIN'S THE BEST, IT'S THE BEST. AND I WAS LIKE, EH I DON'T BUY THAT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, I'M MORE BRISKET THAN MAN NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALTHOUGH, INTERESTING, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A CATERED DINNER HE STILL MADE US WAIT IN LINE FOR FIVE HOURS. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT WAS WORTH IT AND MY POINT IS THIS -- I'M NOT LEAVING! I'M JUST GONNA, CHAINED TO THE DESK HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, AS MUCH AS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TELLING ME, OH, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE, THEIR TACOS ARE THE BEST, OR HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ATTACKED BY THOUSANDS OF BATS? YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT HERE IN AUSTIN. YOU KNOW, OUR UNDERBRIDGE ATTACK BATS ARE THE BEST ATTACK BATS YOU'VE EVER SEEN. AS MUCH AS THAT PANNED OUT THERE'S ONE REFRAIN THAT I'VE HEARD WHILE I'VE BEEN HERE THAT STILL FEELS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF HYPERBOLE.
DEMOCRATS SALIVATING AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING ABLE TO FLIP TEXAS, SOLID RED, TO ONE DAY IN THE NEAR FUTURE A BLUE STATE.
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT TEXAS WAS GOING TO BE BLUE IN 2012.
Jon: REALLY! TEXAS IS GOING BLUE? LISTEN TO ME, TEXAS HAS BEEN A CONSERVATIVE STATE SINCE DINOSAURS ROAMED IT 6,000 YEARS AGO. (APPLAUSE) AT LEAST, THAT DATE'S ACCORDING TO THE TEXAS STATE HIGH SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, IF TEXAS IS RIPE FOR A BLUE OVER, IF TEXAS IS RIPE TO TURN BLUE, HOW DOES REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT CARRY A 20-POINT LEAD AGAINST WENDY DAVIS IN THE LATEST POLLS? 20 POINTS. 20 POINTS. I ASSUME, I ASSUME THAT THAT POPULARITY COMES FROM ABBOTT MAYBE STARTING TO SELL HIMSELF TO BLUE-LEANING TEXAS VOTERS AS AN ENLIGHTENING CENTRIST. HE SUED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 30 TIMES.
ABBOTT HAD OPINED THAT DEMOCRATS POSED A GREATER THREAT TO TEXAS THAN NORTH KOREA.
ABBOTT POSTED AN AD ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE THAT SHOWS A GUN AND BIBLE AND READS, TWO THINGS EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW HOW TO USE, NEITHER OF WHICH ARE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS.
Jon: AND THAT'S WHY, THAT'S WHY GREG ABBOTT IS OPENING HIS HOWDY JESUS, BANG! BANG! BIBLE ACADEMY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) 'CAUSE ISN'T IT TIME --"GO FIGHTING MAGI"-- ISN'T IT TIME YOUR KIDS' TEACHERS ASK THE QUESTION, WHAT WOULD JESUS SHOOT? (LAUGHTER) SO TEXAS IS NOT QUITE READY FOR A BLUE GOVERNOR -- OR A MODERATE GOVERNOR OR ANYONE WHO EVEN A DECADE AGO WOULD BE CONSIDERED A MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN, IS THERE ANYONE UP FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE WHO'S TOO FAR RIGHT FOR A TEXAS THAT MIGHT BE TURNING BLUE? HOW ABOUT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE?
SENATOR DAN PATRICK PROUDLY ADMITS HE IS A CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE AND EVEN WALKED OFF THE SENATE FLOOR DURING A MUSLIM PRAYER.
GUNS ON CAMPUSES. ENDING THE POPULAR ELECTION OF US SENATORS. AND OUTLAWING ALL ABORTION EVEN IN THE CASE OF RAPE. (BOOING)
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU COULDN'T BE REDDER THAN THAT GUY IF YOU TOOK CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG AND SHOVED IT INTO THE DEVIL'S RECTUM. THAT'S AS RED AS RED CAN RED! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I MEAN, HERE'S THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY, I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T DO THAT WHOLE PICTURE. I'M GLAD IT WAS JUST THE DOG. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, IF THERE IS JUST EVEN A HINT OF TEAL IN THIS STATE, THAT GUY'S GOT TO BE GOING DOWN.
NUMBERS RELEASED TODAY SHOW COMMANDING LEADS FOR REPUBLICANS CANDIDATES STATEWIDE. DAN PATRICK CAME OUT WITH A 17-POINT LEAD OVER DEMOCRAT LETICIA VAN DE PUTTE.
Jon: 17-POINT LEAD! IS HE RUNNING AGAINST A DEMOCRAT OR A JAR OF SALSA FROM NEW YORK CITY! MAYBE THE BLUENESS, MAYBE THE BLUENESS -- (LAUGHTER) MAYBE THE BLUENESS  IS STARTING ON A MORE OF THE LOCAL LEVEL, THE CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES.
AND YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, HEY, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH, YOU KNOW, GAYS IN THE MILITARY. LOOK AT THE GREEKS. WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY DID HAVE PEOPLE COME ALONG WHO THEY LOVED THAT WAS THE SAME SEX AND WOULD GIVE THEM MASSAGES BEFORE THEY WENT INTO BATTLE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF FIGHTING, IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR AND IF YOU'RE SITTING AROUND GETTING MASSAGES ALL DAY, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LAST VERY LONG. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW GAYS AND THEIR MASSAGES. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS OKAY IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WARS HAD HAPPY ENDINGS, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) WOW! I FEEL LIKE, THAT GUY IS ACTUALLY TRYING TO TURN TEXAS DIP (BLEEP). AND THAT'S JUST THE TIP OF THE RED-BURG.
THE GOVERNMENT SPOOKS ARE DRUNK ON POWER.
DOING WHAT DEMOCRACY SAYS YOU WILL NOT DO.
THE HUBRIS AND ARROGANCE OF GOVERNMENT SOCIAL ENGINEERING.
EUROPEAN STYLE SOCIALISM.
SOCIALISM IN IT'S PUREST FORM.
WHERE'S THE CONSTITUTION?
IS THIS STILL AMERICA?
THE PRESIDENT DESERVES TO BE IMPEACHED PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
BOY I TELL YOU, I HATE TO SEE A DICTATORSHIP COME INTO THIS COUNTRY BUT IT SURE LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
Jon: WOW, THAT GUY SEEMS AWFUL FOLKSY ABOUT DICTATORSHIP SHOWING UP ON AMERICAN SOIL! SHUCKS! I HATE TO, YOU KNOW, SEE US GETTING READY TO THROW FOLKS INTO BOX CARS AND SEND THEM OFF TO LABOR CAMPS, BUT... (LAUGHTER) SHOOT! I RECKON THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. (LAUGHTER) HEY! MRS. JOHNSON, DO I SMELL PIE? IS THAT YOUR RHUBARB PIE? I SURE WOULD LIKE A SLICE! WHILE WE'RE ALL STILL FREE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YES! EVEN IN THE FACE OF ALL THAT, DEMOCRATS SOMEHOW THINK THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE THIS STATE.
THE ONE THING DEMOCRATS HAVE WORKING IN THEIR FAVOR NOW IS DEMOGRAPHICS.
IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS, HISPANICS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 42% NECK AND NECK WITH THE CAUCASIAN WHITE POPULATION IN TEXAS.
YOU WILL BE ANNOUNCING THAT WE'RE CALLING THE 38 ELECTORAL VOTES OF TEXAS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU POOR BASTARDS. (LAUGHTER) DEMOCRATS IN TEXAS ARE LIKE THAT DRUNK GUY AT THE BAR WHO WON'T STOP HITTING ON A GIRL, EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS SHE'S A LESBIAN. (LAUGHTER) NO, NO DUDE, TRUST ME! I CAN FLIP HER! I JUST NEED TIME! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
