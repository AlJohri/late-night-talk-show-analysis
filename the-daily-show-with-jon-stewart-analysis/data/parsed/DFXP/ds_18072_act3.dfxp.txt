[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW. MY GUEST TONIGHT SAID HE'S  AN ASTRO PHYSICIST AND THE  DIRECTOR OF HAIDEN  PLANETARIUM AT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN NEW YORK. HE SAID THIS IS HIS BOOK NOW  OUT IN PAPERBACK. I TEND TO BELIEVE HIM. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW NEIL. DEGRASSE TYSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪
Jon: THEY LOVE THE  SCIENCE.
YOU GOTTA LOVE THE  SCIENCE.
Jon: ANYTHING YOU WANT  TO SAY TO ME. MAYBE IN THE FORM OF AN  APOLOGY OR --
I NOTICED YOUR NEW OPEN.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU THINK  OF IT IN TERMS OF IT  ACCURACY, IN TERMS OF  EFFICACY.
IT WAS CHEAP AS ALL GET  OUT BUT EARTH WAS SPINNING  THE CORRECT DIRECTION EXCEPT A LITTLE TOO FAST. ANY PEOPLE ON IT WOULD HAVE  FLUNG OFF. OTHER THAN THAT THE GLOBE IS  FINE. WE'RE COOL. WE'RE COOL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT DOES IT TAKE  TO SATISFY YOU? I GET IT IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION AND THE SPEED IS  OFF! [LAUGHTER] DAMN YOU AND YOUR CHRONICLES  OF FATE.
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS  REVERSE THE VIDEO. WHAT IS SO HARD ABOUT THAT? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M JUST SAYIN, YOU KNOW?
Jon: I NEED MAKE A  PHONECALL. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T -- WOULDN'T ALL THE  WORDS BE REVERSED.
WELL,.
Jon: BECAUSE THEY ARE  ALL ATTACHED. WE CAN'T SEPARATE. YOU CAN'T DO IT. IT'S ALL ATTACHED.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
Jon: YOU A MAN OF  SCIENCE NOT WIZARDRY,  SCIENCE.
HERE IS SOMETHING  INTERESTING.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A  QUESTION.
SURE.
Jon: WHY ARE THE  ASTEROIDS TRYING TO KILLING  US -- TRYING TO KILL US?
THE UNIVERSE HAS ALWAYS  TRIED TO KILL US.
Jon: WHY ARE THEY  GETTING CLOSER?
WE'RE NOTICING MORE AND  WE'RE LIVING ON MORE OF THE  SURFACE.
Jon: THE MORE WE EXPAND  THE POPULATION. THE METEORS HAVE BEEN  HITTING US FOR YEARS BUT  SOMETIMES IN UNPOPULATED  AREAS.
MOST OF WHICH THE SURFACE  OF THE EARTH IS.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY IT  LIKE THAT IT MAKES ME SOUND  SILLY. [LAUGHTER]
THINK OF IT THE AREA OF  PACIFIC. NOBODY LIVES THERE. AND CANADA -- NORTHERN  CANADA. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NORTHERN CANADA. MOST OF SIBERIA.
Jon: DO YOU HAVEY IDEA  WHAT YOU UNLEASHED. THE PAIN YOU BROUGHT UPON US  ALL. SEND YOUR LETTERS TO BRIAN  WILLIAMS, NBC. [ LAUGHTER ]
HERE IS SOMETHING  INTERESTING. SOME OF THOSE WHO WAS GONE  UNNOTICED EXCEPT IN THE LAST  10-15 YEARS THERE ARE  SENSORS TO MONITOR NUCLEAR BLASTS AND THE NUCLEAR BLAST  HAS THE SAME SONIC SIGNATURE  IN THE ATMOSPHERE AS A METEOR STRIKE SO NOW WE CAN  FIND THEM IN UNPOPULATED  AREAS.
Jon: I NOTICED IN THE  RUSSIAN ONE THEY HAVE  DASHBOARD CAME RANCH I WANT  ONE. IT'S GREAT FOR ALIEN  ABDUCTIONS, YOU KNOW? RIGHT?
Jon: IT'S NOT TO SAY  WHAT THE FIELD PAYS BUT I  WOULD THINK YOU COULD AFFORD A DASHBOARD CAMERA. YOU ARE A MAN OF SCIENCE OR  GO TO RADIO SHACK AND BUILD  ONE.
IT'S DATA.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE A  DRONE?
I'M NOT AUTHORIZED TO -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT WAS THAT? [LAUGHTER] WAS THAT A GLANCE OF PEOPLE  AT THE SNRAB.
I MAY OCCASIONALLY DRONE  MYSELF BUT I DO NOT ONLY A  DRONE.
Jon: SO NO DRONE. DO YOU NOT HAVE A DRONE. WHAT IS THE BIGGEST -- WHAT  DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE  BIGGEST THREAT TO MAN'S  EXISTENCE ON THIS PLANET? DO YOU BELIEVE IT WILL BE  ONE OF THOSE ASTEROID EVENTS  OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU'VE BEEN COOKING UP? A PATH AGAIN, SOMETHING AT  THE PLAN PLANETARIUM THAT YOU  THINK -- WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS GOES?
MY PEOPLE HAVE ASTRO  FIZZPHYSICISTS, OKAY?
Jon: WHO BY THE WAY  HAVE SUFFERED PREJUDICE FOR  TOO LONG. SHOUTS OF NERD!
MY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN  TELLING THE WORLD ABOUT THE  THREAT OF ASTEROIDS FOR 30  YEARS. ONCE WE IDENTIFIED THE  CRATER THAT WAS WHAT TOOK  OUT DINOSAURS AT THE TIP.
Jon: LAND -- THE.
THE YUCATAN PENINSULA OF  AMERICA COAX THERE'S A  CRATER FOUND BY PEOPLE DRILLING FOR OIL. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR  GRAPHATIONAL ANOMALIES. THEY FOUND A RIDGE A PERFECT  CIRCLE 100 MILES IN  DIAMETER. THE DATE WHERE THAT CAME  FROM, YOU LOOK AT THE  RECORDS THEY WENT EXTIJT 65  MILLION YEARS AGO. THERE'S THE SMOKING GUN.
Jon: THIS IS  CORRELATION CAUSATION. IT WAS LIKE WHAT WAS THAT  SOUND AND THEY TURNED AND  RAN TO THE SAME TREE? I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST SAYING IS IT  NECESSARILY THAT IT CAUSED  IT.
POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY. THAT THEY --
Jon: SO YOUR SAYING  THERE'S A CHANCE.
THAT ALL DINOSAURS RAN  INTO A TREE AND DIED AND RAN  THEMSELVES EXSTINGT. NO LAW OF PHYSICS PREVENTS  THAT BUT IT'S UNLIKELY. THAT BURSTS OF STUDY OF  CLIMATE SCIENCE.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY IT  LIKE THAT IT MAKES ME FEEL  STUPID.
I DON'T MEAN.
Jon: CAN YOU STICK  AROUND -- FOR REAL. STICK AROUND AND TELL ME  EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN.
I CAN SO DO THAT.
Jon: SPACE CHRONICLES. GET A HOLD OF IT.
