FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY  SHOW."  WELCOME. I AM JOHN OLIVER, JON STEWART  STILL NOT HERE. HE IS AT HOME RECOVERING THERE A  STATE-OF-THE-ART PROCEDURE IN  WHICH HE SWITCHED FACES WITH NICHOLAS CAGE. ( LAUGHTER )  THEY TOOK HIS FACE OFF. MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM "MAD MEN,"  LINDA CARDELLINI IS HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BUT FIRST, FIRST TONIGHT, I AND  THE REST OF AMERICA WOKE UP THIS  MORNING IN THE WORST WAY  IMAGINABLE.
GOVERNOR, WELCOME BACK TO THE  CHANNEL.
THANK YOU. I GET TO BE HERE THE ENTIRE  HOUR.
John: WELL, WELL, WELL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELL, WELL, WELL. LOOK WHAT THE FOX DRAGGED IN  ( LAUGHTER )  SARAH PALIN HAS BEEN HIRED BACK  BY FOX NEWS, AND SHE ONLY LEFT FIVE MONTHS AGO. SHE'S NOW EFFECTIVELY QUIT  QUITTING. ( LAUGHTER )  SHE CAN'T EVEN COMMIT TO BEING  UNCOMMITTED. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S BE FAIR TO HER. PEOPLE DO CHANGE. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
I AM DOING GREAT, WRITING A  BOOK, A BOOK ABOUT CHRISTMAS,  AND PUSHING BACK ON THE POLITICALLY CORRECT WHO WOULD  TRY TO TAKE CHRIST OUT OF  CHRISTMAS. DO NEW YORKERS FEEL LIKE YOU'RE  JUST A BUNCH OF LITTLE BABIES  WITH THANK GOODNESS YOU GOT THIS  NANNY. YOU JUST PUT THE B.S. IN CBS. WITH BENGHAZI, THE GOVERNMENT  LIED AND PEOPLE DIED. GOVERNMENT LIED AND GOVERNMENT  SPIED.
John: OKAY, DR. SEUSS. ( LAUGHTER )  BY THE WAY, THAT LITTLE RHYME IS  FROM ONE OF SARAH'S KIDS' BOOKS,  "ALL THE PLACES YOU'LL LEAVE." I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO  BEGIN WITH HER. I MEAN-- HOLD ON. I THINK I'VE JUST REALIZED  SOMETHING. ( BLEEP ). THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS. JUST BECAUSE I WALKED INTO A  SUPERMARKET DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE  TO BUY ANYTHING. THIS IS BRINGS US TO OUR NEW  INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SEGMENT. "WAIT A SECOND. WE CAN JUST IGNORE HER."  ( LAUGHTER )  WE CAN DO THAT.   ( CHEERS )   WE CAN ALL DO THAT. THAT IS A POWER WE HAVE. BECAUSE, YES, WE COULD SPEND THE  WHOLE SHOW JUXTAPOSING VIDEO  CLIPS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW SARAH PALIN'S STRONGLY FELT  CONVICTIONS ARE NOTHING MORE  THAN SELF-CONTRADICTORY  NONSENSE. OR WE CAN JUST IGNORE HER. YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE CAN RESPOND TO HER OBVIOUS  TROLLING WITH A SERIES OF INSULTING JOKES, AND MAYBE  TOGETHER ENJOY A BRIEF MOMENT OF  CATHARSIS, OR WE CAN JUST ( BLEEP ) IGNOG HER. I PROMISE, AMERICA, IT WILL FEEL  SO GOOD. IT WILL BE LIKE WE GIVE OUR  BRAINS AN ENEMA TOGETHER. I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL BE EASY. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT HER. SHE'S A TEMPTRESS. ( LAUGHTER )  OH, SARAH, IF ONLY IT WAS AS  EASY FOR US TO QUIT YOU AS IT IS  FOR YOU TO QUIT EVERYTHING. ( LAUGHTER )  SO LET'S JUST MOVE ON. LET'S JUST MOVE ON BECAUSE WE  CAN. TO A MUCH LIGHTER SUBJECT, IRAN. ( LAUGHTER )  OUR MORTAL ENEMY, IRAN, THE  GREAT THREAT THE PONTIEST BIT OF  THE AXIS OF EVIL, RULED BY A TINY CARTOON VILLAIN WITH AN  IRON GRIP ON POWER THAT HE WILL  NEVER RELINQUISH.
IN IRAN VOTERS ARE GOING TO  THE POLLS TODAY TO ELECT A NEW  PRESIDENT.
SIX CANDIDATES ARE VYING TO  REPLACE OUTGOING PRESIDENT  MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD, WHO IS BARRED FROM SEEK A THIRD  CONSECUTIVE TERM.
John: HOLD OHOLD ON. SO THE MOST SERRIFYING SUPER  VILLAIN ON THE WORLD STAGE HAS  BEEN BROUGHT TO HIS KNEES BY TERM LIMITS? ( LAUGHTER )  THAT MEANS HE TECHNICALLY HAD  LESS POWER THAN MICHAEL  BLOOMBERG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  INCIDENTALLY, THAT IS A CONTRAST  THAT WOULD UPSET AHMADINEJAD FOR SO MANY REASONS. NOW, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE LAST  ELECTION IN 2009 IN IRAN DIDN'T  GO TOO WELL. SO BRACE YOURSELF, EVERYONE.
IRAN HAS A NEW  PRESIDENT-ELECT, A MODERATE  CLERIC, NABBING MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTE.
John: WAIT, REALLY? ( LAUGHTER )  A MODERATE? SO THE PEOPLE IN IRAN HAVE  SPOKEN, SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH  KHOMEINI'S DAYS ARE NUMBERS.
IT'S IRAN'S SUPREME COURT  LEADER WHO HAS ULTIMATE POWER  AND IT WAS HIS GUARDIAN COUNCIL OF CLERICS WHO PREAPPROVED THE  SIX CANDIDATES.
John: I GET IT. THESE DAYS ARE TECHNICALLY STILL  NUMBERED, JUST IN THE THOUSANDS. YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE  LIKE TO VOTE IN AN ELECTION  WHERE THE CANDIDATES ARE PREAPPROVED BY A SMALL HANDFUL  OF RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES WITH  VASTLY INFLATED POWER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THAT WOULD BE SO FRUSTRATING. IMAGINE HOW ANNOYING THAT WOULD  BE. IT IS HARD FOR US IN AMERICA TO  KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THIS. ON ONE HAND, THE IRANIAN PEOPLE  ONLY GOT TO CHOOSE FROM A  PREAPPROVED SELECTION OF HARD-LINE CONSERVATIVES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY CHOSE  THE MOST MODERATE ONE. ON ONE HAND, THE THE IRANIAN  PEOPLE SEEM HAPPY, MARCHING AND  CHANTING IN THE STREETS. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS FAR AS I  CAN TELL FROM WATCHING THE NEWS,  THAT IS KIND OF HOW THEY REACT TO EVERYTHING. ( LAUGHTER )  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS--  WHENEVER THERE IS A DEMOCRATIC  ELECTION IN EYE COUNTRY WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY ON GOOD TERMS WITH,  AMERICA GETS TO PLAY ITS  FAVORITE GAME--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND TO ANSWER THAT IMPORTANT  QUESTION, LET'S CHECK IN WITH  OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS.
A TURNOUT OF MORE THAN 70%  SUGGESTS MANY EVENTUALLY CAME  OUT AND VOTED FOR ROUHANI.
THIS IS A CANDIDATE WHO CAME  IN AND INJECTED SOME OPTIMISM  AND HOPE THAT MAYBE IRAN CAN IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE  WEST.
John: YES, OF COURSE. IT'S A GOOD THING, DEMOCRATIC  ELECTIONS, 72% TURNOUT. THAT'S HUGE. BASICALLY, EVERYONE NOT UNDER  HOUSE ARREST IN IRAN VOTED. ( LAUGHTER )  SO THAT'S DEFINITELY UNQUALIFIED  GOOD NEWS.
THIS IS A FAKE ELECTION AND A  FAKE DEMOCRACY. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES.
John: OKAY, I TAKE THAT  BACK. ( LAUGHTER )  A FAKE ELECTION IS NO GOOD. WE IN AMERICA HAVE NO TOLERANCE  FOR FAKE THINGS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHEESE,  DESIGNER HANDBAGS AND BREASTS. OR, OR, OR THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN  ACCESSORY, DESIGNER CHEESE  BOOTS. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  THERE IS SOMETHING BOTH SEXY AND  NAUSEATING ABOUT THAT. STILL, THERE IS ONE POSITIVE  ASPECT OF THIS ELECTION THAT WE  CAN ALL AGREE ON-- IRANIANS, AMERICANS, EVEN ITOLANS, AND  THAT IS, THAT THIS GUY IS GONE,  THIS 56-YEAR-OLD WITH AN IMPRESSIVE COMMITMENT TO THE  MEMBERS ONLY JACKET. ( LAUGHTER )  THIS-- THIS MAN WHO HAS A  Ph.D. IN TRAFFIC PLANNING--  THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE. HE IS A DOCTOR OF TRAFFIC,  ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, MOST OF  THE TIME HIS ONLY SOLUTION IS TO JUST DENY THE TRAFFIC JAM EVER  HAPPENED. THE POINT IS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THE POINT IS-- THE POINT IS HE  NOW LEAVES HIS POSITION AS CHIEF ANTAGONIST TO THE ENTIRE PLANET. BUT HE WILL LIVED ON IN HIS  WORDS, HIS CRAZY, CRAZY CRAZY  WORDS.
AHMADINEJAD LAUGHED ABOUT  TOPICS LIKE THE TORTURE OF HIS  OWN PEOPLE.
HE FAMOUSLY DENIED THE  HOLOCAUST.
SUGGESTING THAT 9/11 WAS AN  AMERICAN CONSPIRACY TO SOMEHOW  HELP ISRAEL.
IN IRAN WE DON'T HAVE  HOMOSEXUALS LIKE IN YOUR  COUNTRY.
I HEARD THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN  IS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
NO, YOU DIDN'T. ( LAUGHTER )
John: I LIKE STEPHANOPOULOS  "OH, KNOW YOU DIDN'T."  OH, KNOW YOU DID NOT. SO NOW WE OFFICIALLY RETIRE  AHMADINEJAD'S TAN MEMBERS ONLY  JACKET TO LIVE IN THE "DAILY SHOW" RAFTERS ALONGSIDE THE  GARMENTS OF OTHER LUNATICS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). GADDAFI, MICHAEL JACKSON'S  COSTUME, AND KIM JONG IL'S  DINNER JACKET TO TAKE ITS PLACE OF HONOR IN THE "DAILY SHOW"  HALL OF FAME. SHINE ON, YOU CRAZY ( BLEEP ). ( LAUGHTER )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
