FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, NEW YORK SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER, FORMER STAR OF NBC'S ESPIONAGE COMEDY "CHUCK." BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE HYPERBOLE OF THE 24-HOUR NEWS CYCLE. OH, BREAKING NEWS, WE FOUND THE PLANE. OH, WE DIDN'T FIND THE... ACTUALLY IT'S... SORRY, IT'S A STYROFOAM CUP. SORRY. BUT YESTERDAY, YESTERDAY IT FINALLY LIVED UP TO THE HYPE.
STUNNING, EPIC UPSET IN VIRGINIA.
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR HAS NOW LOST HIS G.O.P. PRIMARY TO TEA PARTY ACTIVIST DAVID BRAT.
AN UNDERDOG VICTORY ON BEHALF OF AN UNFUNDED NEWCOMER.
THIS IS SIMPLY UNPRECEDENTED.
THE HISTORY-MAKING SURPRISE.
DAVID OVER GOLIATH TIMES A THOUSAND.
Jon: A THOUSAND!  [LAUGHTER] THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. YOU NEED TO TAKE THE BIBLICAL STRUGGLE OF ISRAEL'S FUTURE KING DAVID AS HE, ARMED WITH BUT A SLINGSHOT, SLAYED A LITERAL GIANT WHOSE VERY NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH LARGE THINGS AND MULTIPLY THAT BY A THOUSAND. THAT, THAT... NO! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I EVEN THINK THAT'S UNDERSTATING IT. THAT WAS LAST NIGHT'S REPUBLICAN PRIMARY IN VIRGINIA'S SEVENTH DISTRICT.  [LAUGHTER] WHERE POLITICAL NEWCOMER DAVID BRAT DEFEATED THE SITTING HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER, AND I CAN ONLY ASSUME FUTURE MILLIONAIRE LOBBYIST, ERIC CANTOR. CANTOR WAS BASICALLY THE FOURTH MOST POWERFUL REPUBLICAN IN WASHINGTON BEHIND MITCH McCONNELL, JOHN BOEHNER AND AN AR-15 THAT FIRES BABY EAGLES DRESSED LIKE JESUS. HOW, HOW... [LAUGHTER] THAT'S... THEY SAID THE PICTURE WON'T BE READY UNTIL THE SHOW. AND I SAID, WELL, ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU CAN DO TO MAKE IT REALISTIC. THAT WOULD BE... THAT'S REALLY QUITE LOVELY. HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN?
HE HAD ALL THE NAME RECOGNITION. HE OUTSPENT HIS OPPONENT 40-1 AND STILL LOST BY AN ASTOUNDING 11 POINTS.
CANTOR'S CAMPAIGN SPENT MORE AT STEAK HOUSES THAN BRAT SPENT ON HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN.
Jon: WELL, OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE. IT'S VERY HARD TO CONDUCT YOUR CAMPAIGN WHEN YOU GOT THE MEAT SWEATS. "MY BUDGET PLATFORM... BRRUFF... LORD HAVE MERCY. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION THERE, WHO IS THIS DAVID BRAT FELLOW?
HE'S A COLLEGE ECONOMICS PROFESSOR.
A 3.4 RATING OUT OF 5 ON RATE MY PROFESSOR DOT COM. STUDENTS ALSO GAVE HIM A CHILLI PEPPER, MEANING HE'S CONSIDERED PRETTY HOT, AS IN GOOD LOOKING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LOOKS LIKE CONGRESS HAS A NEW McDREAMY. STEP ASIDE, VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS. ALL RIGHT. I LIKE WHAT I'M SEEING FROM THIS FELLOW, BUT IS HE MORE THAN EYE CANDY?
THE REASON WE WON THIS CAMPAIGN IS THERE IS JUST ONE REASON, AND THAT'S BECAUSE DOLLARS DO NOT VOTE. YOU DO.
Jon: WOW. I LOVE THE SENTIMENT, ALTHOUGH, A CERTAIN SUPREME COURT MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU, BUT I LIKE THE CUT OF HIS JIB. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT THERE, FELLA?
LUKE 18:27. JESUS REPLIED, "WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH MAN IS POSSIBLE WITH GOD." [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.
THIS IS A MIRACLE FROM GOD THAT THIS HAPPENED. WE BELIEVE IN GOD WHO GAVE US THIS MIRACLE TODAY. I LOVE EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT GOD MADE ON THIS PLANET.
Jon: WE GET IT. YOU BEAT A JEWISH GUY. WE GET IT. FINE. WE'RE NOT AS CHOSEN AS WE THOUGHT WE WERE. OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING, THOUGH? WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ABOUT THE JEWISH PEOPLE, IF I MAY, IS THAT IF WE HAD ACHIEVED A VICTORY LIKE THIS ELECTION, THE NEXT DAY THAT WOULD BE A NEW JEWISH HOLIDAY. THAT WOULD BE... WE'D HAVE A, IT'D BE EIGHT DAYS AND WE'D COME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF POTATO-ONION THING TO EAT, AND KIDS, KIDS WOULD HATE IT. SO WHAT STRATEGY DID GOD USE THERE TO DEFEAT THE PRO-LIFE OBAMACARE-REPEALING, PRESIDENT-OBSTRUCTING, DEBT CEILING, DEFAULT-RISKING, TAX LOOP-HOLE EMBRACING GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWNING ERIC CANTOR?
BRAT WENT AFTER CANTOR FOR NOT STAYING TRUE TO CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES.
HE TRIED TO SAY THAT IN FACT ERIC CANTOR WAS TOO LIBERAL.  [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: HE'S TOO LIBERAL? YES, NO I IMAGINE YOU COULD HAVE SAID ERIC CANTOR WAS TOO LIBERAL PRE-ENLIGHTENMENT. CERTAINLY DURING THE MIDDLE AGES CANTOR'S VIEWS ON ACCEPTING GRAVITY WOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS. HOW IS THIS CAT TOO LIBERAL?
IMMIGRATION REFORM, THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT DAVE BRAT, TRIED TO HAMMER ERIC CANTOR WITH IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS.
AND IT IS TIME TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGAL RESIDENTS AND CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE WHO ARE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AS CHILDREN AND WHO KNOW NO OTHER HOME.
Jon: COMMUNIST! [LAUGHTER] GET BACK IN YOUR HYBRID CAR THAT RUNS ON NPR TOTE BAG COMPOST AND OLD LILITH FAIR POSTERS. AND WHATEVER THE BIPRODUCTS OF STEAK ARE. HOW DID YOU SPEND $168,000 ON STEAK? I MEAN, HOW MANY SIDES CAN YOU ORDER? THERE'S CREAMED SPINACH, HASH BROWNS. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, ERIC CANTOR, THE TOWER OF SEAFOOD THAT YOU ORDERED AT THE STEAK PLACE, WAS RAPUNZEL LIVING AT THE TOP OF IT? BECAUSE THAT'S... ALL RIGHT. SO, 65,000 PEOPLE IN ONE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN VIRGINIA HAVE OVERTHROWN A CLEARLY ARROGANT AND UNSUSPECTING INCUMBENT. REALLY HARD TO DRAW ANY BROADER LESSONS CONSIDERING LINDSEY GRAHAM, WHO IS MORE SUPPORTIVE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM THAN EVEN CANTOR, EASILY DEFEATED HIS TEA PARTY OPPONENTS. THEN AGAIN, I DON'T HAVE 24 HOURS OF NEWS TO FILL, SO TO THE BROADER LESSON MOBILE!
THE VOTERS ARE SIMPLY ANGRY.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE STATUS QUO.
THE BIG MESSAGE FOR WASHINGTON IS THAT NOTHING IS GOING TO GET PASSED IN ANY FORM OF LEGISLATION.
THERE'S NO CHANCE FOR COMPROMISE.
COMPROMISE? FORGET ABOUT IT.
IMMIGRATION REFORM IS NOW DEAD IN CONGRESS.
I THINK IT'S EVEN DEADER.
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DANGEROUS NOW FOR REPUBLICANS TO TALK TO DEMOCRATS.
Jon: OH, NO. CONGRESS' CURRENT GOLDEN AGE OF COOPERATION AND PRODUCTIVENESS IS OVER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
