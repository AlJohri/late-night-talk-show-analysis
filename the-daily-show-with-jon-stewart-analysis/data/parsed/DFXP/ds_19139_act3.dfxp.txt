Jon: A CHEMISTRY.
THANK YOU. THAT'S AWESOME. IT'S HALF THAT AND ALSO HALF MARK AND I ARE FRIENDS. WE GET ALONG REALLY WELL. LIKE, WE KIND OF HAVE NATURAL FRIENDSHIP. SO I THINK THAT KIND OF HOPEFULLY COMES ACROSS.

Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS PURE TALENT, GIRL, TALENT!
NO.
Jon: NO, IT WAS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THERE IS A TWIST IN THE MOVIE...
YES.
Jon: THAT HAPPENS THAT I SHOULD NOT, DO NOT WANT TO GIVE AWAY.
NO, YOU CAN'T.
Jon: RIGHT.
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THE MOVIE.
Jon: SO JUST, SO, SO LET'S DO THIS THEN, JUST TELL ME HOW "MAD MEN" ENDS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT THIS MOVIE, TELL ME HOW YOUR OTHER PROJECT...
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.
Jon: SO I CAN'T, I, SO, NO...
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE FAIR DEAL. NO.
Jon: I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE AWAY THE PLOT TWIST THEN. HERE COMES THE PLOT TWIST. NO I WON'T DO THAT. SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, WHAT IS THE PLOT TWIST?
I SEEM TO ONLY WORK ON THINGS THAT I CAN'T ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT OR PROMOTE.
Jon: THAT ARE SECRETS.
YES.
Jon: DID YOU...OKAY. LET ME...SO, HOW... SO, SHOULD WE BACK INTO THIS? DID YOU, WHEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THE PLOT TWIST...
YES, YES.
Jon: DID YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, "DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING."
YES. DO THAT AGAIN.
Jon: DO YOU NOT, DO YOU NOT HAVE A VARIETY OF CARTOON...
NO, NOT LIKE THAT. DO IT AGAIN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HERE'S WHAT'S SAD. I WILL.
I KNOW YOU WILL. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU KNOW, THAT'S A STANDARD, YOU KNOW, YOU DO THE BAOOGA...THAT'S...YOU DO THE WHOLE, YOU DON'T HAVE A RUN THROUGH THE GAMUT OF CARTOON...
NO.
Jon: DID YOU WATCH, WERE YOU FAN OF THE CARTOONS.
YEAH, FOR SURE, WHEN I WAS A KID. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO BELIEVE ME, I DON'T WATCH THEM ANYMORE. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND SOPHISTICATED AND "GRAVITY FALLS" HAS THESE INCREDIBLE PLOT LINES.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
Jon: OKAY. WHAT WAS THE LAST CARTOON, DID YOU EVER SEE, WHAT WAS THE LAST LIKE CARTOON YOU WATCHED?
OH, GOD, I WAS REALLY INTO NICKELODEON WHEN IT HAD LIKE "DOUG" AND I THINK IT WAS LIKE "REN AND STIMPY" AND STUFF LIKE THAT. DID YOU...
Jon: OH DEAR LORD, HOW OLD AM I?
YOU'RE REALLY OLD.
Jon: REN AND STIMPEY I REMEMBER. THAT IS... SHE'S RIGHT. SHE'S NOT LYING. >>NO.
Jon: DOES IT SURPRISE YOU WHEN YOU, LIKE, JON HAMM'S PROBABLY ABOUT MY AGE, RIGHT?
YEAH.
Jon: BUT HE LOOKS GREAT. [LAUGHTER] HOW DOES... WHY DO TWO PEOPLE, JON HAMM AND MYSELF...
YEAH.
Jon: WE'RE BOTH EQUALLY MADE UP OF HUMAN DUST...

Jon: WHATEVER, WHY DOES HE GET TO LOOK LIKE THAT?
I DON'T KNOW, JON.
Jon: AND I GET THIS.
I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: [BLEEPED] UP.
I'M SORRY. [LAUGHTER].

Jon: NO, DON'T FEEL BAD. I'VE LEARNED TO DEAL IT.
I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: WATCH, WATCH. WHAT? THAT'S WHAT IT'S USEFUL FOR.
SEE? AWESOME.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, DO YOU EVER, DO YOU EVER MEET PEOPLE THAT YOU LIKE SEE ON TELEVISION OR IN THE FILMS IN PERSON AND THINK THEY LOOK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN HOW THEY LOOK IN REGULAR LIFE? ACTORS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE SO, THEY TRANSFORM THEMSELVES PHYSICALLY.
YEAH, FOR SURE. I THINK SO.
Jon: WHO DO YOU GOT? ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR? I THOUGHT JENNIFER LAWRENCE LOOKED LIKE HELEN MIRREN.
OH, YEAH, I JUST WATCHED THAT. I JUST WATCHED THAT INTERVIEW. YEAH. I TOTALLY SAW IT. I SEE WHAT YOU SAW.
Jon: THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
Jon: THANK YOU.
SHE ACTED LIKE YOU WERE CRAZY. BUT I SAW WHAT YOU SAW.
Jon: KIND OF LIKE... YEAH.

Jon: SHE'S TREMENDOUS.
BUT I SAW WHAT YOU SAW.
Jon: YEAH. LIKE HELEN MIRREN.
YEAH, YEAH. TOTALLY. YOU'RE STILL UPSET ABOUT THAT, AREN'T YOU?
Jon: JUST WAIT UNTIL I GET HOME AND THINK ABOUT HOW OLD I AM COMPARED TO JON HAMM. THAT'S GONNA REALLY...
YOU'RE JUST AIRING YOUR GRIEVANCES WITH ME.
Jon: NOT AT ALL. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? DO YOU HAVE? DO YOU GET REGRETFUL FOR ANY THINGS?  SOMEBODY ASKED ME EARLIER, DO YOU GET REGRETFUL FOR ANYTHING.
SOMETIMES.
Jon: OK, SO I HAVE, THERE'S AN ISRAELI WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE. SHE SAYS TO ME BEFORE THE SHOW, WE'RE FANS OF YOURS, WE'RE FROM ISRAEL. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A JEWISH QUESTION.
OKAY.
Jon: WHAT WAS YOUR MOST REGRETFUL INTERVIEW, BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, MY PEOPLE TEND TO LOOK INTERNALLY...
SURE.
Jon: TYPICALLY WITH DISAPPOINTMENT.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: SO, I WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, THE DONALD RUMSFELD INTERVIEW BECAUSE HE STARTED A WAR FOR NO REASON AND LIED A LOT ABOUT IT, AND LIKE KEPT LYING ABOUT IT EVEN ON THE SHOW.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND I THOUGHT LIKE, OH, I'LL NAIL HIM ON THAT, AND HE'LL BE LIKE [BLEEPED], IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD FOR OLD DONNIE RUMSFELD, YOU GOT ME. BUT I DIDN'T.
BUT, IT DIDN'T WORK? I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BLAME YOURSELF FOR THAT, THOUGH. HONESTLY.
Jon: CAN I JUST...
I'M JUST HERE TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.
Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY, CAN I JUST KEEP YOU AROUND?
I'LL JUST WHISPER IN YOUR EAR WHEN YOU'RE FEELING BAD. [WHISPERING] "I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT."
Jon: I FEEL LIKE IF I SHAKE YOU, IT WILL SNOW. IT WILL JUST SNOW. IT WILL BE LIKE, I'LL KEEP YOU IN A LITTLE GLOBE, AND I'LL JUST GO, "ELIZABETH, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME". SHOOK, SHOOK, SHOOK.
I THINK YOU'RE DOING GREAT, JON.
Jon: THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TALK ABOUT, "THE ONE I LOVE."
