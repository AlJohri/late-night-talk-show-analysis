Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART STILL NOT HERE IN A  HUGE DEAL. HE'S ACTUALLY BEING TAKEN OVER  BY AMAZON CEO JEFF BEZOS. SUCH A SHAME. JON STEWART PROUDLY OWNED  HIMSELF FOR 50 YEARS. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW  FILM "PARANOIA" LIAM HEMSWORTH  IS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH A  SUBJECT EVERYBODY LOVES: TAXES. WHO IN AMERICA DOESN'T GROW UP  EXCITEDLY LEAVING A BOX OF YOUR  OLD RECEIPTS AT THE FOOT OF YOUR BED ON APRIL 15 EVE HOPING THAT  IF YOU'VE BEEN GOOD AN  ACCOUNTANT FROM THE NORTH POLE WILL SHOW UP ON HIS MAGIC SLEIGH  AND REWARD YOU WITH A  SURPRISINGLY LARGE INVOICE FROM THE GOVERNMENT? BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT OUR TAX  SYSTEM IS SOMEHOW NOT  UNIVERSALLY BELOVED?
WE NEED TO OVERHAUL OUR TAX  CODE.
THE TAX CODE IS BROKEN. IT'S NOT FAIR.
IT IS INEFFICIENT. OUR TAX CODE IS ONE OF THE  WORST IN THE WORLD.
SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE. WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR TAX  CODE.
John: WHOA, WATCH YOUR MOUTH. YOU CAN'T JUST TALK TO CODES  LIKE THAT. THEY'RE VERY SENSITIVE. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF  CRITICISM THAT DROVE THE MORSE  CODE TO SUICIDE. FOR ALL OF YOU MORSE CODE FANS. YES, LOOK, WE ALL THINK THE TAX  CODE NEEDS PRUNING EVERY NOW AND  AGAIN. THAT IS WHY WE DO IT, I IMAGINE,  EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS.
OUR TAX CODE HASN'T BEEN  REFORMED SINCE 1986. THAT'S 27 YEARS.
WOW. TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE  TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 HAPPENED  THE SAME YEAR THAT THIS WAS  HAPPENING.
I'M COW BOY GEORGE. AND I'M BOY GEORGE. PICK YOUR PICK. CHOOSE YOUR PICK. BE THERE, BY GEORGE. John: WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED  THIS FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC ISSUE  IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY SINCE THE WAY WHEN BOY GEORGE COULD GUEST  STAR ON THE A-TEAM. BY THE WAY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY  MORE 1980s THAN THAT IF A  RUBIC'S CUBE MADE LOVE TO A NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM  AND GAVE BIRTH TO A V.H.S. COPY  OF FLASH DANCE THEN THAT COPY OF FLASH DANCE WAS RAISED BY THREE  MEN: RIGHT? WHILE WE HAVEN'T REFORMED THE  TAX CODE SINCE 1986 WE'VE  CERTAINLY ADDED LOTS OF NEW PROVISIONS AND LOOPHOLES TO IT. IT'S LIKE IMAGINE YOU HAVE THE  SAME REFRIGERATOR FOR THE LAST  27 YEARS. YOU HAVEN'T CLEANED IT IN ALL OF  THAT TIME. BUT YOU KEEP PUTTING FOOD IN  THERE. AND NOW THE THING SMELLS SO BAD  YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO TOUCH IT. THAT IS AMERICA'S CURRENT TAX  CODE. AN OLD REFRIGERATOR FULL OF  ROTTEN FOOD. NOW, OVER THE YEARS,  CORPORATIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL  INTERESTS HAVE MADE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THIS BROKEN  REFRIGERATOR, EXPLOITING  FEATURES FROM THE INTEREST  DEDUCTION THAT ALLOWS HEDGE FUND MANAGERS THE PAY ONLY 20% ON  THEIR EARNINGS TO THE DRILLING  COST DEDUCTION THAT LETS OIL COMPANY WRITE OFF THE EXTRA COST  OF BUSINESS TO THE -- AND THIS  IS TRUE -- CHICKEN POOP CREDIT. THAT'S REAL. I'M SERIOUS. UNDER SECTION 45 OF THE TAX  CODE, YOU CAN GET A TAX BREAK  FOR BURNING CHICKEN POOP. WHICH IS CLEARLY INSANE. YOU SHOULDN'T BE PAID TO BURN  CHICKEN POOP. YOU SHOULD DO IT FOR THE LOVE OF  CHICKEN POOP BURNING SO IF THE  TAX CODE NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND THERE'S A BIPARTISAN DESIRE TO  FIX IT, WHY HASN'T ANYONE DONE  IT IN 27 YEARS?
THE REASON WE'RE NOT SEEING  MORE MEANINGFUL TAX REFORM IS  QUITE SIMPLY BECAUSE ALL OF THE POLITICIANS ARE TERRIFIED TO  ALIENATE THE BASE THAT FUNDS  THEM.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND  SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING BASICALLY  TO DO POLITICAL SUICIDE.
IT'S THAT THIRD RAIL OF THE  NEW YORK SUBWAY SYSTEM. YOU GRAB AND YOU'RE ELECTROCUTED  JON IS IT JUST ME OR DOES  POLITICS SEEM TO HAVE A SURPLUS OF THIRD RAILS, CERTAINLY WAY  MORE THAN THREE.
NATIONAL SECURITY HAS BECOME  BASICALLY THE THIRD RAIL IN  AMERICAN POLITICS.
THE POLITICS OF GUN  REGULATION ARE A THIRD RAIL.
SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE  SO-CALLED THIRD RAIL OF AMERICAN  POLITICS.
MEDICARE REFORM PACKAGE AND  OF COURSE THAT'S THE THIRD RAIL  OF POLITICS.
THE TRUE THIRD RAIL OF  AMERICAN POLITICS: PICKING A  FAVORITE SPORTS TEAM FROM OUTSIDE YOUR STATE.
John: IT'S LIKE AMERICA'S  POLITICAL SYSTEM IS BUILT  ENTIRELY OUT OF THIRD RAILS. IT'S WHY YOU CAN'T URINATE  ANYWHERE IN THE WASHINGTON D.C. AREA WITHOUT GETTING  ELECTROCUTED. THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S A FACT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY SINGLE  PART OF THE TAX CODE IS IN THERE  BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTED IT TO BE. IF YOU AS A POLITICIAN EVEN  CONSIDERED TAKING ONE OUT, ITS  BACKERS WILL MAKE YOU PAY. SO YOU'VE GOT TO THINK TWICE  BEFORE GOING UP AGAINST BIG  HEDGE FUNDS, BIG OIL OR BIG CHICKEN POOP. THEY'LL GET YOU. AND WHAT'S MORE IT'S PROBABLY  NOT JUST THEIR CURRENT JOBS THAT  LAWMAKERS ARE TRYING TO PROTECT. IT'S ALSO THEIR MUCH MORE  LUCRATIVE FUTURE JOBS.
IN 1974, ONLY 3% OF RETIRING  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BECAME  LOBBYISTS. TODAY THAT NUMBER IS 42% FROM  MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE AND 50% FOR  SENATORS.
John: I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD  SAY THIS: BUT WASHINGTON REALLY  HAD SO MUCH MORE INTEGRITY BACK IN THE WATERGATE ERA.   ( APPLAUSE )   LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS NOWADAYS  OUR LAWMAKERS ARE SO CHICKEN [BLEEP] YOU COULD GET A TAX  BREAK FOR SETTING THEM ON FIRE. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. HERE'S THE CRAZY THING. THEY'RE NOT WRONG TO BE SCARED. WHICH IS WHY THE CREDIT MUST GO  HERE TO SENATORS BAUCUS AND  HATCH WHO ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO OVERHAUL THE TAX CODE FROM  SCRATCH. THEY'VE COME UP WITH AN INGENIUS  PLAN TO ENCOURAGE THEIR  COLLEAGUES TO DO SOMETHING APPROACHING THEIR JOBS.
LEADERS OF THE SENATE FINANCE  COMMITTEE HAVE PROMISED THEIR  FELLOW LAWMAKERS THAT ANY SUGGESTIONS THEY MAKE ABOUT WHAT  DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS ARE  PRESERVED IN TAX REFORM WILL BE KEPT SECRET FOR 50 YEARS.
John: THAT IS THE LAMEST TIME  CAPSULE EVER. LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS FROM 2013. WE GOT A SLEEN A GOMEZ CD. SOMETHING CALLED A SNUGGIE AND,  OH, A 10-TO-1 SPENDING CUTS  DEAL. IT'S ALL RETRO. THIS IS HOW PARANOID THE  SENATORS ARE WITH THEIR  SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING THE  COUNTRY BETTER MIGHT LEAK OUT AND THEREBY DESTROY THEIR  CAREERS. THE 50-YEAR BALLOT OF SECRECY  WASN'T ENOUGH. THEIR IDEAS AND OPINIONS WILL  EACH GET THEIR OWN I.D. NUMBER  AND BE STORED ON PASSWORD PROTECTED SER SERVERS AND IN  LOCKED SAFES. THOSE LOCKED SAFES WILL HAVE A  HANDLE MADE OF A DEADLY SPIDER  WHICH, EVEN IF YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO TOUCH IT, IT WON'T  ACTUALLY WORK. IT SPEAKS. IT SPEAKS TO HOW BROKEN THE  ENTIRE SYSTEM IS THAT THIS STORY  IS BOTH COMPLETELY LUDICROUS AND COMPLETELY LOGICAL. IT'S ALSO HAD AN AMAZING LACK OF  COVERAGE. WE FOUND THREE STORIES ON IT. ONE WAS THE CNBC STORY THAT YOU  SAW EARLIER. FOX MENTIONED IT ONCE IN  PASSING. THE OTHER WAS ON CNN WHO, LIKE A  FLIRTATIOUS CAT, BRIEFLY BRUSHED  UP AGAINST THIS STORY'S LEG.
OUR IDEAS OUR ELECTED  OFFICIALS FLOAT TO FIX THE TAX  SYSTEM. WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEM,  RIGHT? WRONG. SENATORS ARE TOP SECRET IN THE  LAST 50 YEARS SO WASHINGTON'S  IDEAS FOR HOW TO COLLECT AND SPEND YOUR MONEY DOESN'T INVOLVE  YOU. CHECK OUT THAT STORY AT CNN  MONEY DOT-COM
John: DON'T THROW IT TO THE  WEB. YOU HAD SOME ACTUAL NEWS THERE. FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO AASIF  MANDVI WHO IS IN D.C. SO AASIF... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AASIF, AN EMBLEMATIC STORY ABOUT  A KEY ISSUE WITH LEGISLATORS TOO  TERRIFIED TO ADDRESS IT AND REPORTERS TOO INCOMPETENT TO  COVER IT.
HOLD ON, JOHN. NOT INCOMPETENT. I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE HOW  TOXIC TAX REFORM IS IN  WASHINGTON. TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT, YOU NEED  SOME REAL AND -- PARDON MY  FRENCH -- COJONES
John: I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S  SPANISH.
WHATEVER. I AM A REPORTER WITH TWO  COJONES. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS  ISSUE NO MATTER HOW DANGEROUS IT  IS IN THIS TOWN. I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE AN ACTUAL  LIST OF POWERFUL WASHINGTON  LOBBYISTS HELL BENT ON PREVENTING TAX REFORM. EVERYONE FROM THE CHAMBER OF...
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,  AASIF, AASIF. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. KEEP VERY STILL. KEEP VERY STILL. I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU BUT IT  WOULD APPEAR THAT YOU ARE BEING  LASER-TARGETED. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TALK  ABOUT THIS?
YES, OF COURSE. IT'S A HUGE STORY. YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. DON'T WORRY. THESE LASERS ARE JUST HERE TO  INTIMIDATE ME. I AM ON TELEVISION. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO  ANYTHING, OKAY. ANYWAY, TOP OF THE LIST HERE IS  THE CHAMBER OF... (GUNSHOT) OH, [BLEEP].
John: [BLEEP]. YOU'VE BEEN TARGETED.
I'M FINE, FINE. John: NO, YOU'RE NOT FINE. I'M NOT PUSSYING OUT AND  THROWING IT TO THE WEB LIKE CNN.
John: THAT'S VERY BRAVE. (MUMBLING)  John: ACTUALLY, YOU DIDN'T  GET THE LIST. JUST TO CORRECT YOU THERE.
ALL RIGHT. (FIRST ON THE LIST IS THE)  GUNSHOT).
OH, [BLEEP]. OH, COME ON.
John: THAT'S WILD. THAT DART TOOK A WHILE TO GET TO  YOU.
TOOK A WHILE. THAT STINGS.
John: ARE YOU OKAY? I'M FINE, JOHN. I'M FINE. ALL RIGHT. NOW LET ME JUST CHECK ONE THING. ARE YOU A SEA HORSE?
John: NO, I'M NOT. I'M NOT A SEA HORSE.
THEN I'M NOT OKAY. John: AASIF MANDVI, EVERYONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [
