FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME! TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TONIGHT-- A GREAT SHOW. A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. IT'S A BIT OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF SHOW, THOUGH. IT'S NOT THE SAME TYPE OF SHOW THAT YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING BECAUSE TONIGHT, THE PERSON ON "THE DAILY SHOW" SHAMELESSLY PLUGGING THEIR NEW MOVIE THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN. ( LAUGHTER ) IS ME. "ROSEWATER." WHOLE SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOOK AT THAT! LOOK AT THAT! DEVIL MAY CARE. I HAVE A DEVILS-MAY-CARE ATTITUDE AND VERY LITTLE VOICE LEFT. THE PRODUCER AND CORRESPONDENT, JASON JONES, WHO STARTED THIS WHOLE MESS BY GOING TO IRAN IN 2009, INTERVIEWING JOURNALIST MAZIAR BAHARI FOR A FIELD PIECE WHICH WAS THEN USED AGAINST MAZIAR BAHARI WHEN HE WAS HELD IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR NINE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE 2009 GREEN MOVEMENT PROTESTS. THEY WILL BE ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT TO DISCUSS THAT FIELD PIECE. JASON AND TIM. MAZIAR BAHARI WILL BE ON THE PROGRAM TO-- OH, BOY. SPOILER ALERT. MAZIAR BAHARI, HE GOT OUT OF PRISON. I-- I ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I HATE TO--   ( CHEERS ) I'VE GIVEN AWAY-- I'VE GIVEN AWAY THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE. ( LAUGHTER ) MAZIAR BAHARI WILL BE HERE. AND, OF COURSE, GAEL GARCIA BERNAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). IF I MAY, THAT IS THE CORRECT RESPONSE. ( LAUGHTER ) WHOOO, INDEED. AND ALSO THE FILM'S DIRECTOR, LOCAL RECLUSE JON DAILY WILL BE JOINING US. SO IT ALL BEGAN-- YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. THIS JUST FEELS WEIRD. I APOLOGIZE. IT JUST I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE-- TALK SHOW HOSTS DON'T PLUG THEIR OWN MOVIES. I THINK IT-- I KNOW WHAT TO DO. ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE DONE THIS IN OTHER SITUATIONS WHEN-- WHENEVER I'VE HAD A "ROSEWATER-"THEMED PROBLEM, I'VE ALWAYS CALLED UPON THIS TO SEE IF I CAN GET SOME HELP. LET ME JUST-- COME ON -- ( LAUGHTER )  ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ♪  ♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HE'S HERE! IT WORKED! IT WORKED!
John: IT'S ME!
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! IT'S A MIRACLE!
John: HEY, HEY, HEY, COOL, EASY, EASY.
Jon:  I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. YOU GOT MY DARJEELING SUMMONS IF YOU WILL.
John: I DID, INDEED. WELL I GOT YOUR TEA POT-GROPING ABOMINATION.
Jon: THANK YOU.
John: I ALSO, AND I GUESS THIS WAS CLEARER.  I GOT THE "ROSEWATER" PRESS KIT, JON.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME.
John: VERY SETTLE, BY THE WAY. IT HAD A BOTTLE OF ROSEWATER, A ROSEWATER BASEBALL HAT, A ROSEWATER BOTTLE OPENER-- WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE WEIRD.
Jon: YEAH.
John: AND, OF COURSE, A HAND-SCRAWLED NOTE BEGGING ME TO COME OVER HERE IMMEDIATELY, SO HERE I AM. THIS IS IT.
Jon: WELL, THAT WAS REALLY ONLY IN YOUR KIT, BUT I'M GLAD YOU DID. YOU CAN-- CAN YOU DO THE SHOW? CAN YOU -- IF --
John: I THINK WE'VE ALREADY SEEN I CAN DO THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  I DO, I DO AGREE.
John: BUT THAT ASIDE, BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
Jon:  I REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT IF YOU WOULD DO IT RIGHT NOW. IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE IF SOMEONE ELSE WAS LEADING THE CONVERSATION. I FEEL THE BEST PERSON TO DO THAT WOULD BE YOURSELF.
John: SURE, I'LL TAKE ANOTHER SPIN IN THE NON-PREMIUM CABLE HOST CHAIR FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.
Jon: ALRIGHT. WHY DON'T WE DO THIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: GET ME IN THAT, GET ME IN THAT PUPPY. GIVE ME IN THAT PUPPY.

John: WILL YOU GIVE ME THE SONG? WILL YOU GIVE ME THE SONG FOR THE SHOW --
Jon: OH YEAH, BABY! WE'LL START THIS RIGHT.
John: DO IT. OKAY, YEAH.
jon: ♪ DA-DA-DA-DA-DA DA-DA-DA-DA♪♪ ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." I'M JOHN OLIVER, SITTING IN FOR JON STEWART, WHO IS OFF FULFILLING HIS LIFE'S AMBITION TO TOUR WITH ONE DIRECTION.  ♪  ♪ SO THAT'S WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHERE HE IS.
Jon:  ACTUALLY, I'M-- I'M RIGHT HERE.
DID I ASK YOU TO SPEAK?
Jon:  NO.
John: DID I SAY YOU COULD SPEAK?
Jon: WAS IT LIKE THIS THE WHOLE TIME I WAS GONE?
John: IF YOU ASK ME TO DO THIS. WE'RE DOING DID MY WAY.
Jon:  YES, SIR. I APOLOGIZE.
John: WELCOME BACK. SO HOW DID "ROSEWATER" BEGIN? AHEAD OF IRAN'S 2009 ELECTION, CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES AND PRODUCER TIM GREENBERG WENT TO TEHRAN, BRINGING BACK THIS AMAZING SERIES OF FILM PIECES.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
I HAD COME TO IRAN TO LEARN WHAT THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FROM FOR DECADES WAS ALL ABOUT. I IMMERSED MYSELF IN THEIR CUSTOMS, THEIR FOOD. HELLO!
HELLO.
HI.
HI.
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CAVE.
THANK YOU.
I KNOW IT'S CALLED A PIGSKIN, OKAY, BUT IT'S NOT AGAINST YOUR RELIGION TO CATCH IT. SECOND DOWN! AS THE ONLY AMERICAN IN THIS ROOM, I'M SCARED. I'M ONLY A SHOE'S THROW AWAY FROM THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. (SPEAKING ARABIC)
YEAH, I DON'T SPEAK ARABIC. WE SPEAK PERSIAN IN IRAN.
I STUDIED ARABIC FOR 10 MONTHS.
I ASSURED MY PRODUCER TIM GREENBERG THAT AS LONG AS HE WAS WITH ME, THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR. ( LAUGHTER )
John:  IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE JASON JONES IS AN UNREMITTING ASSHOLE. PLEASE WELCOME THE TEAM BEHIND "BEHIND THE VEIL," TIM GREENBERG, AND JASON JONES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: THANK YOU. JUST TAKE IT DOWN, TAKE IT DOWN FIVE NOTCHES.
Jon: YEAH!
John: DO YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST GO. GOOD DAY, GOOD DAY TO YOU.
Jon: BUT I --
John: I SAID GOOD DAY! GOOD DAY, SIR! JON STEWART, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
Jon:  OKAY, SO. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WOULD SO VERY MUCH LOVE TO SAY THAT TO HIM BUT I CAN'T.
IT'S EASIER WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE ANYMORE.
IT REALLY IS.
John: SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS MESS AND THEN THIS MOVIE BEGAN. YOU FOUND MAZIAR FOR YOUR FIELD PIECE. HOW DID YOU FIND HIM AND WHY DID HE STAND OUT AS BEING SUITABLE?
WELL ONE OF OUR SEGMENT PRODUCERS SENT US A VIDEO THAT MAZIAR HAD BEEN IN WHEN HE SPOKE TO TED KOPPEL. AND I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY LOOKING AT THIS VIDEO, LOOKING BACK, ALL THIS STUFF THAT HAS HAPPENED THIS MOVIE, EVERYTHING, LAST FIVE YEARS-- I REMEMBER THAT MOMENT LOOKING AT THE VIDEO, AND THINKING-- YEAH, THAT WILL DO. HE WILL DO. AND HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT MOMENT, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
John: BUT WHAT, WHAT--
HE SPOKE ENGLISH.
John: RIGHT. BUT --
HE WAS LITERALLY THE ONLY PERSON WE FOUND IN IRAN WHO COULD SPEAK ENGLISH.
BUT HE ALSO SPOKE TO WHAT YOU NEEDED TO HEAR AS WELL, WHICH WAS POINTING OUT THAT OUR PERCEPTION OF IRAN AND THE REALITY WERE TOO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.
YEAH, HE HAD A, HE WAS FROM IRAN BUT HAD, YOU KNOW, LIVED IN LONDON AND HAD A LEG IN BOTH WORLDS AND COULD EXPLAIN THAT, YES, EXACTLY, THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEENS OUR COUNTRIES, THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES AND THAT WAS EXACTLY ONE OF THE POINTS WE WERE MAKING GOING THERE.
John: SO HOW, YOU KNOW, IF, IF IRAN IS AS AFRAID OF THE WESTERN MEDIA AS "ROSEWATER" MAKES IT CLEAR--
UNDERSTANDABLY.
John: WHY THE ( BLEEP ) DID THEY LET YOU IN? NOT JUST BOTH OF YOU, SPECIFICALLY -- ( LAUGHTER ) SPECIFICALLY TIM GREENBERG. SEEMS LIKE THAT MIGHT BE--
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING HERE WITH THE "BERG" PART.
John: YEAH. HOW -- BUT WHY DID THEY LET YOU IN?
WELL THEY DIDN'T-- WELL HERE, FUNNY STORY. AS WE LANDED IN TEHRAN, JASON JONES, THE CANADIAN WALKED RIGHT IN AND SIPPED TEA WITH THE LOCALS. TIM GREENBERG OF JEWISH DESCENT AND AMERICAN WAS PULLED ASIDE FOR AN HOUR.
YEAH, SEE I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS SO FUNNY, ACTUALLY. ALTHOUGH, AS SOON AS WE GOT DOWNSTAIRS THEY TOOK ME INTO THIS SORT OF SIDE ROOM WITH TWO SECURITY GUARDS AND THEY STARTED WATCHING SOCCER AND COMPLETELY IGNORED ME. SO I FIGURED ALRIGHT, THIS WON'T BE THAT BAD. AND IN FACT, OUR TIME THERE WAS JUST THAT. IT REALLY WAS, IT FELT LIKE IT WAS A FINE PLACE FOR US TO BE. WE DID NOT FEEL THREATENED. WE DID NOT FEEL THAT BASICALLY WHAT WAS ABOUT TO COME A FEW WEEKS LATER, WE DID NOT REALLY SENSE. THERE WAS A SLIGHT SENSE OF A SOCIETY OPPRESSED, VERY SLIGHT, BUT GENERALLY, WE WERE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH ALL THE KINDS OF STUFF WE DO ON THE "DAILY SHOW."
WE GOT A LITTLE TIP-OFF IN THE LITTLE SCENE WE SHOWED PLAYING FOOTBALL WITH THE KIDS. WE WERE IN A TOWN CALLED ISFAHAN, VERY HOLY TOWN AND OUR FIXER CAME RUNNING UP TO US. HE WAS LIKE, WE HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. QUICK, QUICK, QUICK. AND WE LIKE OKAY YEAH, WE'LL LEAVE THE HOLY SQUARE. AND HE NO, THE CITY. THE CITY. WE'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE CITY.
John: HOLY ( BLEEP ).
APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY FOOTBALL IN THEIR HOLIEST OF HOLY SQUARES.
John: TO THROW A PIGSKIN AROUND.
A PIGSKIN. A PIGSKIN, YES.
WHEN WE WERE LEAVING HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR, WE WERE LIKE, SO ARE WE JUST DONE WITH THAT LOCATION? HE WAS LIKE, NO, YOU CANNOT RETURN TO THAT CITY AT ALL.
YES. YOU WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED BACK IN ISFAHAN EVER AGAIN.
John:  I GUESS BASICALLY CONSIDERATIONS ARE IN ORDER. YOU GOT A SPIN-OFF. BECAUSE SNL DOES SPIN-OFFS ALL THE TIME, "WAYNE'S WORLD," "BLUES BROTHERS" AND IT SEEMS ONLY FITTING THAT THE "DAILY SHOW" GETS A SPIN-OFF INVOLVING AN IRANIAN JOURNALIST BEING TORTURED.
THAT WAS OUR MISSION.
YEAH, YEAH.
John: TIM GREENBERG AND JASON JONES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
