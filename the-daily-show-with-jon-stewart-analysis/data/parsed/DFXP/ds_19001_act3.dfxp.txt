Jon:.
WE ARE BACK HERE WITH BILL O'REILLY, THE BOOK IS KILLING JESUS. IT IS ACTUALLY A HOW TO. I THINK IT IS VERY INAPPROPRIATE. SO HERE IS MY -- I HAVE GOT A COUPLE OF BONES, YOU WANT TO PICK A BONE.
YOU GO AHEAD.
Jon: THE SYRIA INTERVENTION, YOU SAY IF WE DON'T ATTACK THERE, WE LOOK WEAK.
WHEN DID I SAY THAT?
I THINK ON YOUR PROGRAM LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO YOU SAID --
IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU GO OUT AND SAY, HEY, IF YOU GAS KIDS WE ARE GOING TO COME AND TAKE CARE OF YOU AND HAMMER YOU, AND THEN WHEN THEY GAS THE KIDS AND THE KIDS ARE DEAD YOU GO, I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN IT. THAT IS NOT A GOOD IMAGE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO IF I WAS THE PRESIDENT NUMBER ONE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE THREAT FIRST OF ALL, I MAY NOT HAVE MADE THE THREAT BUT
WHAT A PRESIDENT YOU'D MAKE
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
WHEN I COME ON THIS PROGRAM I AM THINKING OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
Jon: YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SELL BOOKS, LET'S BE FRANK. SIF I HAD MADE THE COMMENT AND THEN HE DID THE GAS AND THE STUFF CAME IN THAT HE DID, THEN I WOULD HAVE SENT A FEW -- BOOM. ON HISHAVE ARSENALS A COUPLE OF AIRPORTS,  TAKE THEM OUT, IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MAYBE TWO HOURS AND IF YOU DO IT AGAIN, IT IS YOU. AND THAT'S IT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU KNOW, SEEING AS YOU SAID THE USE OF CHEMICALS WEAPONS AND -- WE DON'T KNOW. THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW.
YES, THEY DO. HE USED THEM. THEY KNOW.
Jon: IF THE U.N. SAYS IT, STEWART, THEY DID IT, OKAY?
THEY DID. THE U.N. --
Jon: SO YOU SAY BASICALLY THE IDEA WOULD BE WE LOOK WEAK.
YES, WE DO.
Jon: IF WE DON'T DO THAT.
YES.
Jon: BUT WE ARE NOT WEAK.
WE ARE NOT?
Jon: NO.
NO?
Jon: WE HAVE THE LARGEST MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
OBAMA LOOKS WEAK TO THE WORLD, I THINK THAT'S A FACT, ALL RIGHT?  HE LOOKS WEAK TO THE WORLD.
Jon: BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS FACT?
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TAUNTING US, STEWART, THEY ARE TAUNTING AMERICA.
Jon: YOU THINK ASSAD BASICALLY, ASSAD DID THIS.
YES.
Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW A RED LINE A YEAR AGO ABOUT THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
YES.
Jon: I THINK I AM GOING TO USE THEM JUST TO PUT IT IN HIS FACE?
NO. I THINK ASSAD CAN'T CONTROL HIS MILITARY AND THE MILITARY DID IT WITHOUT -- BUT HE IS IN CHARGE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO PART OF THE CALCULATION THOUGH IS IF I DEGRADE SYRIA ANY FURTHER, DOESN'T THAT CREATE MORE CHAOS NO MATTER WHERE THE CHEMICALS WEAPONS ARE.
I DON'T THINK HE CAN DO THAT, IF YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU TELL PEOPLE NOT TO KILL CHILDREN AND THEY DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION.
Jon: BUT THEY ALREADY HAD BEEN KILLING CHILDREN AND BY THE WAY THEY ARE KILLING CHILDREN ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
IF YOU BASICALLY DEFINE IT AS DON'T DO THIS, THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID, DON'T USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
Jon: RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT?  AND HE DOES, YOU HAVE GOT TO BACK IT UP AND SO.
Jon: AND SO HE THREATENED MILITARY INTERVENTION RUSSIA STEPPED IN AND NOW WE HAVE A DEAL ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND WE WILL SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT. IF THIS IS A WAY TO AVOID THE MILITARY, ISN'T THAT BETTER THAN, HEY I SAID IT THAT BUT THAT IS LIKE TELLING YOUR KIDS, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE WAY TO DEAL WITH A PROBLEM IN SCHOOL IS YOU SHOULD HIT THE KID.
NO THAT IS LIKE TELLING THE KIDS IF YOU DO THIS I AM GOING TO DO THAT AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT YOU ARE A WIMPY FATHER AND THEY WILL RUN ALL OVER YOU.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING IS YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE IN ANY OF THE CHANGING FACTORS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO WHAT THEY SAY.
I DON'T HAVE ANY BEEF WITH THE WAY IT WORKED OUT AND I THINK IT IS GOOD THE WAY IT WORKED OUT FOR THE COUNTRY.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOKS LIKE A WEAK LEADER, HE LOOKS INSIDE --
Jon: THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID, I LIKED THE WAY THIS WORKED OUT FOR THE COUNTRY.
WE ARE LUCKY. WE WERE LUCKY.
Jon: HOW DO YOU KNOW WE WERE LUCKY?
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GET INVOLVED IN A SITUATION THAT WOULD, COULD HAVE LED TO TERRIBLE THINGS. ALL RIGHT?  SO --
Jon: EVERY SITUATION YOU GET INVOLVED IN COULD LEAD TO TERRIBLE THINGS.
YEAH, BUT THIS ONE WAS FRAUGHT INSIDE AND OUT BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, AND THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T CONFER WITH THEM. HE SCREWED THIS UP, COME ON, YOU CAN'T BE SAYING HE LOOKED GOOD IN THIS, ARE YOU SAYING --
Jon: I AM SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HE LOOKS IN THIS, WHAT MATTERS IS RESULTS.
IT MATTERS.
Jon: IT MATTERS TO WHO?  IT MATTERS TO US..
OH, PLEASE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
COME ON.
Jon: IT IS A HIGH SCHOOL MENTALITY FOR GOVERNING A COUNTRY, IT IS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: IT IS LIKE SAYING -- IF YOU
IF YOU MAKE THE THREAT YOU BACK IT UP. HOW ABOUT THIS, I AM GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS IF YOU TAKE MY LUNCH MONEY, I'M SORRY, I STILL HAVE TO KICK YOUR ASS BECAUSE I SAID I WOULD DO IT SO I HAVE TO SHOW THAT I AM RIGID.
LOOK IF YOU THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME OFF LOOKING WELL IN THIS, YOU ARE --
Jon: I DON'T CARE HOW HE COMES OFF LOOKING. THAT IS MY POINT. I CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD. I DON'T CARE IF HE PUT ON A DRESS AND LIPSTICK AND SASHAYED HIS PRETTY ASS AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAID, LOOK AT ME!  I AM A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL!
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE ROAD.
Jon: ALL I'M SAYING IS, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED, WE AVOIDED A MILITARY CONFRONTATION.
Jon: AT A TIME WHEN THIS COUNTRY CAN ILL AFFORD ONE, THAT IS TRUE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I AM GLAD THEY HIRED YOU BACK, THAT ENGLISH GUY, I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HIM. THAT ENGLISH GUY YOU HAD ON -- IT IS LIKE, HELLO. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HIM.
Jon: DON'T WORK OUT YOUR AGE OLD ANTIPATHY TO THE ENGLISH HERE.
THE IRISH HAVE TO LEARN, THEY HIRED YOU BACK AND IT IS A GOOD THING YOU ARE BACK, BECAUSE HE I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. NOW HOW IS THE ZOMBIE MOVIE DOING?
Jon: ABOUT THE IRANIAN JOURNALIST THAT WAS CAPTURED.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A ZOMBIE MOVIE AT NET FLIX. IT IS NOT.
DIDN'T YOU GUYS THINK IT WAS A ZOMBIE MOVIE ON NET FLIX?
Jon: IT IS ACTUALLY CALLED KILLING O'REILLY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: KILLING JESUS IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. BILL O'REILLY!
