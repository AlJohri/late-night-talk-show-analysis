[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW -- I WILL SAY THIS, NEW YORK'S MAYORAL RACE NOT THE ONLY ELECTION TOMORROW. IN VIRGINIA VOTERS WILL DECIDE BETWEEN TWO TRULY REMARKABLE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES OF THEIR OWN. [ LAUGHTER ] SOMEBODY HERE IS FROM VIRGINIA. AL MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
VIRGINIA. THE STATE HAS GIVEN US SOME OF OUR MOST HONORED LEADERS. AND IN TOMORROW'S  GOVERNOR'S RACE SHE COULD GIVE BIRTH TO ANOTHER. REPUBLICAN KEN CUCINELLI OR DEMOCRAT TERRY McAULIFFE.
THESE TWO CANDIDATES ARE AMONG THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.
APPARENTLY NEITHER IS FIT TO LEAD.
FOR VIRGINIANS IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN A FAR RIGHT WING TEA PARTY SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE AND A DEMOCRAT WHO HAS BEEN GUILTY OF SLEAZY BUSINESS DEALS AND QUESTIONABLE FUNDRAISING..
Reporter: PROFESSOR WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE. HOW BAD COULD THEY ACTUALLY BE?
I'VE NEVER SEEN UNFAVORABLE RATINGS THIS HIGH FOR BOTH OF THE MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES. LESS THAN 30% OF VIRGINIANS HAVE LESA FAVORABLE VIEW OF EITHERAVE CANDIDATE. IF THEY WERE THAT BAD I HAD TO SEE IT FOR MYSELF, SO I HEADED TO THEIR FINAL DEBATE.
THEY ARE TRYING TO OUTLAW COMMON FORMS OF CONTRACEPTION AND WANT TO MAKE THE PILL ILLEGAL.
TERRY SAID YOU HELP ME, I HELP YOU. IT'S POLITICS.
Reporter: THEY SEEM LIKE YOUR RUN OF THE MILL JERKOFF POLITICIANS.
TWO (bleep). [LAUGHTER]
MAYBE I JUST WASN'T PAYING CLOSE ENOUGH ATTENTION. THIS SEEMED FAMILIAR. THE CUCH IS A TYPICAL TEA PARTYER AND TEFLON TERRY MIXES POLITICS AND MONEY. POL
WITH CUCCINELLI THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED GIFT GATE WHERE HE ACCEPTED MONEY.
YOU MEAN McAULIFFE.
THIS IS CUCINELLI. CUCCINELLI DOES THE EXACT SAME THING?
ANYTHING ELSE.
McAULIFFE HE WAS TAKING HIS WIFE AND NEWBORN SON BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL TO HOME BUT HE STOPPED AT A DEMOCRATIC FUND RAISER FOR AN HOUR WHILE THE WIFE AND NEWBORN STAYED IN THE CAR.
WHAT? PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
YES, HE BRAGGED ABOUT IT IN HIS OWN BOOK.
SORRY, I JUST VOMITED IN MY MOUTH. WAIT THERE'S MORE.
TERRY McAULIFFE IS A WALKING NEGATIVE AD.
KEN CUCCINELLI IS OUT THERE.
HOMOPHOBIC AND ANTI-CHOICE.
THERE'S A QUESTION OF PRIVATE JETS AND VACATION HOMES.
THIS WILL IS NOT --
HOLY (bleep) THIS IS A NIGHTMARE. EVEN MAJOR NEWSPAPERS ARE ENBORISSING NONE OF THE -- ENDORSING NONE OF THE ABOVE AND GUY WHO IS NOT EVEN RUNNING.
YOU SEE WHY SO MANY VIRGINIANS ARE FLUMMOXED. FLUMMOXED? IS THAT A SOUTHERN TERM THAT  MEANS THE SAME AS (bleep)?
I HAD ONE VOTER TELL ME IT WAS A CHOICE BETWEEN A HEART ATTACK AND CANCER.
TOMORROW VIRGINIANS WILL ENTER A POLLING STATION AND ACTUALLY HAVE TO  PICK A HEART ATTACK OR CANCER TO BE THE GOVERNOR. WHAT INVOLUNTARY LOOKS OF HORRIBLE DISGUST RUN ACROSS EACH VOTERS FACE WHEN MAKING THIS DECISION. TO FIND OUT WE MADE TWO DRINKS A TERRY McAULIFFE, A GREASY MIX OF BEAT JUICE, VINEGAR, ANCHOVIES, AND COMMERCIAL WASTE, AND THE KEN CUCINELLI, A HAZARDOUS COMBINATION OF IRISH CREAM, VINEGAR, LIME JUICE, AND AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF WINDEX. WE TOOK OUR SAMPLES TO THE STREETS. FIRST UP THE CUCINELLI. LET'S SEE THAT AGAIN IN SLOW MOTION. HOW ABOUT THE McAULIFFE. DID YOU JUST VOMIT RIGHT THERE?
JUST A LITTLE.
NO ONE WAS PREPARED TO MAKE THE CHOICE. WHICH ONE WOULD YOU RATHER DRINK FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS?
THEY ARE BOTH HORRIBLE. I LOVE VIRGINIA BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF VIRGINIA THIS REPRESENTS.  PERHAPS WE WE HAVE TO FIND MORE SUITABLE STAND-INS FOR PEOPLE TO INGEST. BECAUSE NO CREDIBLE CHOICES RAN IN YOUR STATE. THE POLLS SAY 36% OF LIKELY VOTERS WILL CHOOSE POND SCUM WHILE 43% ARE SUPPORTING DOG POOP. WHAT DOES THIS SAY ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF POLITICS. IT WAS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES WHERE TRUE WISDOM CAME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY PEOPLE EAT DOG POOP.
CRAZY WORLD WE LIVE IN?
YES, IT IS. >>YES IT IS, SON. YES IT IS.
