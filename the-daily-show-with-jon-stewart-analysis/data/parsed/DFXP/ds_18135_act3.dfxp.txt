( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACTOR WHO  CAN CURRENTLY BE SEEN IN  "SMURF 2" AND HIS UPCOMING FILM IS "LOVELACE."   ♪ IF YOU AIN'T IN YOUR THING  LIKE YOU WANT TO GET YOUR THING   ♪ ♪
JERRY?
YEAH.
NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY. WHAT'S WITH THE ( BLEEP ) SHAD  SHADOWS. YOUR SHAD ROSE COSTING ME  HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS.
YOU WANT TO TURN THE LIGHTS  OFF. ( BLEEP ). NO PROBLEM. I'LL TURN THEM OFF. ( BLEEP ).
MAKE A MOVIE WITHOUT LIGHTS.
John: PLEASE WELCOME BACK  TO THE SHOW THE FANTASTIC HANK  AZARIA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: PLEASE, PLEASE,  PLEASE. "LOVELACE," IT'S ABOUT LINDA  LOVELACE, OF COURSE, STAR AND/OR  VICTIM OF "DEEP THROAT."
YES, TALK ABOUT THE LACE ON  MY WIG AS YOU SAW THERE.
John: THAT WAS SOME WIG. WHEN SOMEONE COMES TO YOU AND  SAYS WE'RE LOOKING FOR A  CD EXPLOITATIVE GREASEBALL IN THIS MOVIE, WE THOUGHT YOU'D BE  PERFECT.
I'M SHOCK YOU ACTUALLY HAD  THE QUOTE THAT THEY USED. ( LAUGHTER )  WELL, MY BUDDY WROTE THE FILM. AND THOUGHT OF ME.
John: THAT IS WORSE.
SO, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE  ASK ME, "WERE YOU HESITANT TO DO  THIS MOVIE?" LIKE, "DID YOU WORRY BECAUSE  IT'S ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY?"  WHAT YEAR IS THIS? WE'RE POST "BOOGIE NIGHTS" HERE. WHEN I SAW THE TOUPEE, I WAS A  LITTLE CONCERNED. I PLAYED THE MAN WHO REALLY DID  WRITE AND DIRECT "DEEP THROAT"  AND HE REALLY DID HAVE A PIECE-- ACTUALLY, HIS WAS WORSE.
John: WOW.
AND HE WAS A HAIRDRESSER.
John: NO WAY.
A WOMAN'S HAIRSTYLIST AND HE  HAD THAT ON HIS HEAD.
John: PORN AND POLITICS ARE  AMERICA'S LAST REMAINING BOOM  INDUSTRIES, AND AS YOU SAW FROM THE SECOND ACT, THEY'RE  BASICALLY FUSED WITH WEINER AND  THIS OTHER GUY. IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE JUST HOW  SUCCESSFUL "DEEP THROAT" WAS FOR  A MOVIE.
IT MADE AN UNBELIEVABLE  AMOUNT OF MONEY. I GUESS THEN CAME "DEBBIE DOES  DALLAS" AND "BEYOND THE GREEN  DOOR."  AND POOR LINDA LOVELACE NEVER SAW A PENNY.
John: OH, WHAT A SURPRISE.
I KNOW.
John: WHAT A SHOCK-- A  WOMAN IN PORN DID NOT SEE LOTS  OF MONEY ON THE BACKEND. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
CAREFUL HOW YOU USE THE TERM  "BACKEND."
John: I WAS HALFWAY THROUGH  THAT SENTENCE THINKING, "I KNOW  THIS END BADLY."
HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING IN  PORN. BUT TODAY, THEY-- I DON'T BEEN  BACKEND, BUT THEY DO-- THEY GET  HIGHLY PAID.
John: RIGHT.
THEY MAKE A NICE LIVING.
John: THE CLEVER THING  ABOUT THIS MOVIE IT'S THE SAME  STORY TOLD TWICE. YOU GET THE GLAMMUOUS VERSION OF  IT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE  FILM WHEN IT IS FUNNY, IN WHICH ARE YOU APPEAR AND THE SECOND  HALF YOU GET THE REALITY OF WHAT  YOU'VE JUST SEEN, WHICH WAS  APPALLING.
HORRIBLE.
John: BECAUSE SHE SUFFERED  DEEPLY, WAS EXPLOITED ON AN  INCREDIBLE SCALE, AND WAS NOT RESPECTED IN ANY HUMAN FORM.
NO, AND WHEN SHE CAME FORWARD  TO REVEAL THAT SHE GOT A LOT OF  CRAP FOR THAT, TOO. YOU KNOW, THE WAY SHE ACTUALLY  PUT IT WAS, "EVERY TIME YOU SEE  ME HAVING SEX ON SCREEN IN 'DEEP THROAT' I WAS BEING RAPED."  THAT'S THE WAY SHE FELT ABOUT  IT. IT WAS A HARD TIME FOR HER. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MOVIE  STRUCTURED THE WAY YOU JUST  MENTIONED. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT WHERE IT  STARTS OVER AGAIN AND SHOWS  YOUUE ENJOYED THAT STORY. NOW WHY DON'T YOU SEE WHAT  REALLY HAPPENED.
THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING. IT SAYS YOU ENJOYED THAT STORY? GUESS WHAT, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE  DONE. LET'S LOOK AT THE REALITY OF IT. IT MAKES YOU COMPLICITY IN WHAT  YOU JUST HAVE BEEN-- WHETHER  TITULATED OR ENJOYED IT, IT MAKES YOU REGRET LAUGHING AT  EVERY POINT OF THE STORY-- APART  FROM THE WIG. THAT WAS GOOD. ( LAUGHTER )  WE'VE NOT MET BEFORE, BUT WE  HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED TOGETHER.
THAT'S TRUE.
John: IN "SMURFS 2" AND I'M  A SMURF. >>.I'M
I ADMIRE YOUR COMEDY AND VERY  GLAD YOU'RE IN "SMURF 2" WITH  ME.
John: "LOVELACE" IS  FANTASTIC. "SMURF 2 I'VE NOT SEEN. I'M SURE IT'S GREAT.
IT IS.
John: "LOVELACE" WILL BE IN  THEATERS ON AUGUST
