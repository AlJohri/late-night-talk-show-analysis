WELCOME BACK.   MY GUEST TONIGHT A CITY HALL REPORTER FOR  THE TORONTO STAR NEWSPAPER, HER  NEW BOOK CALLED "CRAZY TOWN,"  THE ROB FORD STORY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, ROBYN  DOOLITTLE.   [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE.   SO YOU'RE A REPORTER AT THE  TORONTO STAR.   HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN COVERING  TORONTO CITY HALL?
I ARRIVED IN JANUARY 2010, JUST IN  TIME TO WATCH THE MAYORAL  ELECTION THAT BROUGHT US ROB  FORD.
WHEN YOU ARRIVED THERE AND  ROB FORD BECAME MAYOR, WHAT'S  CANADIAN FOR HALLELUJAH?   DID YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT THIS  WILL BE AN EVENTFUL FEW YEARS  FOR ME?
THE FIRST LITTLE WHILE THAT  ROB FORD WAS MAYOR, HE WAS NEVER THE TYPICAL MOLD OF A  POLITICIAN.   HE WAS ALWAYS VERY COLORFUL AND  HE DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF FRIENDS  AND HE WAS AGGRESSIVE.
HE STARTED OFF SOMEWHAT  POSITIVE WITH THE COLORFUL  THING.   VERY QUICKLY WENT IN TO  AGGRESSIVE.
IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT A YEAR  AFTER THAT I STARTED HEARING  ABOUT DOMESTIC INCIDENTS AT  THE MAYOR'S HOME, THEN RUMORS OF DRUGS AND THEN HE STOPPED COMING TO CITY HALL EVERY DAY.   HIS STAFF DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE  WAS SOMETIMES.   AND IT WAS A YEAR AFTER THAT  THAT --
LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.
OKAY.
SO THERE'S RUMORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, DRUGS AND ABSENTEEISM.
RIGHT.
AND EVERYONE WAITED A YEAR.   HOW DOES HE GET AWAY WITH THIS?  IS HE JUST -- WHAT KEEPS HIM  LOVABLE AND IN CHARGE?
WELL, PART OF IT, I THINK YOU GUYS TAKE FOR GRANTED HOW GREAT  YOUR ACCESS INFORMATION LAWS AR, AT LEAST COMPARED TO CANADIAN LAWS.
OH REALLY?
SO I HEAR ABOUT INSTANCES, FOR INSTANCE, IN DECEMBER 2011 THE MAYOR'S WIFE'S PARENTS CALLED 911 TO SAY ROB  FORD HAD TAKEN THEIR CHILDREN,  HE WAS DRUNK DRIVING AND GOING  TO THE AIRPORT.
OH, GOD.
I CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY  WON'T CONFIRM THAT THE CALL EVEN OCCURRED, THAT THEY'RE  INVESTIGATING ANYTHING.   YOU CAN FILE AN ACCESS REQUEST  FOR THAT AND NOT GET ANYTHING  BACK IN OUR COUNTRY.   AND THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE  PROBLEM WHEN YOU'RE REPORTING ON THESE ISSUES IS IT'S SO HARD TO  FOLLOW UP ON THIS STUFF.   SO IT TOOK A FULL YEAR TO DO  THIS INVESTIGATION.   MY PAPER TOOK A BIG RISK BY  PUTTING OUT THERE IN MARCH OF  LAST YEAR, I ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE  KEVIN DONOVAN WROTE A STORY  SAYING THE MAYOR'S STAFF WANTED  HIM TO GO TO REHAB, THEY FELT  HIS DRINKING WAS IMPACTING HIS  WORK, THAT HE HAD BEEN KICKED  OUT OF A MILITARY BALL FOR  SHOWING UP IMPAIRED AND THAT WAS BEFORE THE CRACK STORY. [LAUGHTER]
THE MAN IS, IF I MAY, AN  ENTIRE SEASON OF A COPS EPISODE. AND SO NOW ALL THIS, YOU'VE DONE ALL THE LEG WORK, ALL THE,  YOU'VE GOTTEN PAST THIS, YOU  YOURSELF WITNESSED THE CRACK  VIDEO, THE INFAMOUS CRACK VIDEO. CAN HE HOLD HIS CRACK?   IS HE A GOOD, WHAT DOES HE  APPEAR IN THERE?
PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THEY ARE, LIKE SOME OF THE SOURCES THAT I  SPOKE WITH FOR MY BOOK ARE IN  AWE OF HIS STAMINA, I GUESS, FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD.   THE FACT THAT WHAT HE PUTS IN TO HIS BODY WHILE BEING AS  UNHEALTHY AS HE IS WITH THE  WHOLE OTHER PART OF HIS LIFE.
SURE.
THAT WOULD BE IMPRESSIVE FOR  LET'S SAY A COMPETITIVE EATER.   BUT HE IS THE MAYOR OF TORONTO AND YET HE'S RUNNING AGAIN.
AND I THINK OUTSIDE OF  TORONTO, PEOPLE KNOW ROB FORD AS THE CRAZY CRACK-SMOKING MAYOR  WHO ENDS UP ON YOUTUBE FOR DOING STUPID STUFF.   BUT THERE'S THIS REALLY INTERESTING  FASCINATING STORY THAT BROUGHT  US TO THIS POINT ABOUT A FAMILY  THAT FANCIES ITSELF A POLITICAL  DYNASTY, THE FORD FAMILY.
SO IT'S LIKE THEY'RE THE  KENNEDYS, IF THE KENNEDYS HAD  ALL SMOKED CRACK. [LAUGHTER]
THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS  THE CANADIAN KENNEDYS.
FOR REAL?
FOR REAL.   YEAH THAT'S CHAPTER TWO. [LAUGHTER]
BUT ALL JOKING ASIDE, AND HE'S BECOME SORT OF A CARICATURE,  BUT THIS MAN IS GOING TO DIE AND PROBABLY RELATIVELY SOON.   AND I WOULD THINK THAT THE  DISQUALIFYING FACTOR FOR-- TORONTONIANS? >>TORONTONIANS, YEP.
THANK YOU.   WOULD ALMOST NOT BE THE FACT  THAT YOUR MAYOR IS HORRIBLY  IMPAIRED WHEN AN EMERGENCY MIGHT ARISE BUT THE FACT HE REFUSES TO GET HELP.
AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.   THAT TO ME SHOULD BE THE  DISQUALIFYING FACTOR IN THIS.
RIGHT.   YEAH, AND IT JUST SPEAKS TO A LARGER  POLITICAL DIVISION THAT'S  HAPPENING IN OUR CITY.   BUT ALSO I THINK THE BIG TAKE  AWAY FOR SO MANY POLITICIANS,  WHAT MADE ROB FORD IS THAT WHEN  HE WAS A CITY COUNSELOR FOR 10  YEARS, HE RETURNED EVERY PHONE  CALL THAT PEOPLE MADE TO HIM.   YOU COULD BE IN SUBURBAN ATOPICO, WHICH IS THE AREA HE REPRESENTS AND SAY I  HAVE A PIPE BUSTED AT THE END OF  MY STREET AND HE WOULD SHOW UP  WITH CITY STAFF AND HE WOULD FIX IT AND THROUGH THE YEARS HE JUST DEVELOPED THIS ARMY OF  SUPPORTERS THAT ARE SO LOYAL TO HIM.  AND HIS POLITICAL MESSAGE IS VERY SIMPLE. IT'S KEEP TAXES LOW, WE TAKE ENOUGH OF YOUR MONEY.  AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO OVERLOOK ALL OF THIS OTHER STUFF BECAUSE THEY FEEL HEARD.  AND THAT'S THE BIG TAKE AWAY.
LET HIM BE YOUR COUNTRY'S  SUPER.   [LAUGHTER] LET HIM BE THE CONCIERGE, IF YOU WILL.   PEOPLE CAN CALL HIM AND GO ROB,  MY SINK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT  HAPPENED.  AND THEN HE COULD COME OVER AND SAY, OH YOU GOT SOME SCHMUTZ IN THE SINK I'LL GET IT OUT, NOW, IF YOU EXCUSE ME, I HAVE A CRACK PARTY.
IT'S NOT ALL OF TORONTO.   CERTAINLY HIS APPROVAL RATINGS  SHOW HE IS AROUND THE 40s.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY VOTER  INTENTION. YOU REALLY HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE CITY  DOES IN OCTOBER DURING THE  ELECTIONS, CAUSE TORONTONIANS ARE FED UP.
ALL RIGHT.
STICK AROUND BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOU-- ALL RIGHT, "CRAZY TOWN," ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW,  ROB FORD STORY.   ROBYN DOOLITTLE, FINE JOB.
