Jon:  WELCOME BACK. FOR MORE ON THE GUN DEBATE WE  BRING YOU THE FIRST PART OF A  THREE-PART SERIES WITH JOHN  OLIVER.
YESTERDAY, AMERICANS WATCHED  IN SHOCK AS EVEN WATERED DOWN  GUN LEGISLATION DIE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE IT  BELONGS, ACCORDING TO GUN  LOBBYIST OF THE VIRGINIA CITIZENS DEFENSE LEAGUE.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS  SACROSANCT.
YOU HOLD THUP SIGN WHENEVER I  MAKE A SUGGESTION THAT YOU THINK  IS INFRINGING UPON YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTSES, OKAY?
OKAY.
ASSAULT WEAPON BAN. BOOM, THERE IT IS. INCREASED BACKGROUND CHECKS. REALLY?
YES.
JUST FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS?
WE DON'T DO BACKGROUND CHECKS  FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
OKAY, SO LET'S JUST TRY THIS  ONE, NICE AND EASY.
SURE.
A MANDATORY ONE-HOUR WAITING  PERIOD IF YOU BUY A GUN.
WHY-- WHY-- ( BLEEP ).
UNLESS I CAN SEE A REASON. NO, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING  THEY SUPPORT BECAUSE AT THE END  OF THE DAY, NONE OF IT WORKS.
EXACTLY, GUN CONTROL DOES NOT  WORK. WHAT IF HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,  GUN CONTROL COULD WORK-- WHICH  OBVIOUSLY IT CAN'T SO WE KNOW IT WON'T SO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM,  BUT WHAT IF IT DID.
WHEN WAS THAT?
AUSTRALIA. YES, AUSTRALIA INSPECT IN 1996,  A CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER  JOHN HOWARD INSTITUTED SWEEPING GUN CONTROL LAWS FOLLOWING A  MASS SHOOTING THAT SHOCKED THE  NATION. SO SHOULD WE BE LEARNING FROM  THIS EFFECTIVE EXAMPLE? OF COURSE NOT.
I GUESS IF WE'RE GOING TO GO  TO PLANET X. AND SAY IT'S NOT  UNITED STATES, SOME OTHER PLANET, DIFFERENT PEOPLE,  DIFFERENT EVERYTHING, I DON'T  KNOW, YEAH, YOU KNOW, BUT IN THE REAL WORLD WITH HUMAN BEINGS  IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK, AND GUN  CONTROL ISN'T GOING TO WORK.
UNFORTUNATELY NOT TONAL IS  AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY IN THE REAL  WORLD. EVEN THEIR ANINALS CAN HOIST A  WEAPON. WHO IS RIGHT ABOUT GUN CONTROL? THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND  OUT. CONFRONT THE MAN RESPONSIBLE. MR. PRIME MINISTER, LET'S BEGIN  IN THE FORMAL AUSTRALIAN WAY--  G-DAY.
HOW DO YOU DO.
OBVIOUSLY, GUN CONTROL  DOESN'T WORK. IT CAN'T WORK. IT WILL NEVER WORK. SO WOW WAS YOUR SCHEME A  FAILURE?
WELL, MY SCHEME WAS NOT A  FAILURE. WE HAD A MASSACRE AT PORT ARTHUR  17 YEARS AGO, AND THERE HAVE  BEEN NONE SINCE.
ZERO GUN MASS CERS. HOLD ON. DID GUN CONTROL ACTUALLY WORK?
IT STOPPED ONE THING. THAT COULD ALSO BE A STATISTICAL  ANOMALY.
YEAH, IT WAS JUST MASS  SHOOTINGS DISAPPEARED.
THERE WERE SO FEW OF THEM,  WHOOP-DEE-DO.
WHOOP-DEE-DO?
YES THEIR SHOOTINGS ARE RARE  ANYHOW.
EXACTLY, THEY PROBABLY BARELY  HAD A MASSACRE BEFORE 1996.
THERE WERE ABOUT 13 IN THE  PREVIOUS 18 YEARS. IN THE 18 YEARS BEFORE PORT  ARTHUR, THERE WERE 13 MASS  SHOOTINGS. ALMOST ONE A YEAR.
I WAS UNAWARE THEY HAD THAT  MANY. MASS BEING, WHAT, MORE THAN TWO  PEOPLE AT A TIME?
MORE THAN FOUR.
MORE THAN FOUR, OKAY.
WHOOP-DEE-DO.
PERHAPS THERE WERE OFFER  NON-WHOOP-DEE-DO SIDE EFFECTS.
THE HOMICIDE RATE INVOLVING  THE USE OF GUNS HAS DECLINED  SIGNIFICANTLY BY FACTORS OF UP TO 50% AND 60%, AND THE  INCIDENCE OF YOUTH SUICIDES  INVOLVING GUNS HAS DECLINED  DRAMATICALLY.
WHOOP-DEE-( BLEEP )-DO. SUICIDE WITH GUNS WENT DOWN,  ZERO MASS SHOOTINGS.
AUSTRALIA STILL HAS MURDER  RATES AND ROBBERIES LAST I  CHECKED.
UNLESS YOU CAN GET RID OF  100% OF CRIME, IT'S NOT WORTH  DOING AT ALL?
PUT IT THIS WAY, IT'S ILLEGAL  TO HAVE CRACK COCAINE ANYWHERE  IN THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU THINK IF SOMEBODY REALLY  WANTS IT THEY CAN GET THEIR  HANDS ON CRACK COCAINE IN  AMERICA?
SO UNLESS WE CAN COMPLETELY  GET RID OF DRUGS, THERE'S NO  POINT IN HAVING DRUG LAWS AT  ALL. ( APPLAUSE )
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A  MINUTE. WELL, I GUESS, EFFECTIVELY IT  DOESN'T WORK.
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH PHILLIP. EVEN HIS LOGIC IS BULLETPROOF.
WELL, LET ME PUT IT TO YOU  THIS WAY. THERE ARE MORE DROWN IN  BACKYARDS WHERE THEY HAVE POOLS. IF THERE ARE NO POOLS THEY DON'T  HAVE A DROWNING IN THE BACKYARD. THE U.S. HAS A VERY HIGH NUMBER  OF GUNS. THEREFORE, THERE IS GOING TO BE  MORE CHANCES FOR SOMEBODY TO BE  KILLED WITH A GUN.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
RIGHT.
RIGHT. THAT'S MY POINT. THE SENATE MIGHT THINK LIVING IN  A SOCIETY WITH DRAMATICALLY  REDUCED GUN VIOLENCE IS EYE WHO-DEE-DO, AND PEOPLE IN  AUSTRALIA COULDN'T AGREE WITH  HIM MORE.
WHOOP-DEE-DO.
WHOOP-DEE-DO, MATE.
WHOOP-DEE-DO, WHATEVER THAT  MEANS.
WHOOP-DEE-( BLEEP )-DO!
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT
