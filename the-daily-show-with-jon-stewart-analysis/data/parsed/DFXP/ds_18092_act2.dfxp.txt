WE CONTINUE TONIGHT OUR SERIES  FROM AUSTRALIA. JOHN OLIVER LEARNED THAT  FOLLOWING A MASS SHOOTING IN  STRAUL, THE COUNTRY INTRODUCED GUN CONTROL, AND IT WORKED. SO HOW CAN AMERICA TAKE THIS  VALUABLE LESSON AND IGNORE IT? JOHN OLIVER FINDS OUT IN THIS,  OUR FINAL INSTALLMENT.
PREVIOUSLY I WENT TO STRAUL  WHEN I LEARNED IN 1996 THEIR  GOVERNMENT ENACTED SWEEPING GUN CONTROL LAWS. THE RESULT-- REDUCED GUN  VIOLENCE AND ZERO MASS  SHOOTINGS. SO ARE THERE ANY LESSONS FOR  AMERICA HERE? VIRGINIA GUN ADVOCATE HAS A  CLEAR ANSWER.
WE'RE NOT AUSTRALIA. IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CULTURE,  DIFFERENT PEOPLE, DIFFERENT  EVERYTHING.
THERE'S NO SIMILARITY WITH  AUSTRALIA. AUSTRALIA IS A FORMER BRITISH  COLONY WITH A WORLD FRONTIER  THAT WAS TAMED BY BRAVE MEN WHO ALSO WIPED OUT ALMOST AN ENTIRE  INDIGENOUS POPULATION, AND WE  ARE? NOT SIMILAR TO THAT, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
RIGHT. BECAUSE UNLIKE AUSTRALIA, WE  AMERICANS KNOW WHEN THE GUNS ARE  TAKEN AWAY, TYRANNY INEVITABLY  FOLLOWS.
THE FOUNDING FATHERS KNEW  THAT GOVERNMENTS TEND TO GROW  BEYOND THEIR MEANS. IN AMERICA, WE'RE STEPPING IN  THE DIRECTION OF A POLICE STATE.
IS THAT REALLY HAPPENING,  PHILLIP, OR IS THAT SOME KIND OF  CRAZY PARANOIA?
WE HAVE POLICE. THEY'RE NOW WEARING NINJA SUITS  IF YOU WILL. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE  POLICE NECESSARILY. THEY HAVE THE BLACK MASKS ON AND  EVERYTHING.
IT ISN'T CRAZY PARANOIA. YOU'RE FRIGHTENED ABOUT NINJA  POLICE.
NINJA POLICE, YES.
YEAH, NINJA POLICE.
YES.
SADLY WITHOUT ACCESS TO  SEMIAUTOMATIC FIREARMS,  AUSTRALLIANS WOULDN'T BE A THING ABOUT REAL FREEDOM.
BLOODY EARTH IS FOR FREE. WE'RE SITTING HERE DOING  WHATEVER WE WANT. EVERYBODY IS JUST HANGING OUT  AND HAVING A GOOD TIME.
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE SAME  CONCERNS ANY MORE ABOUT GETTING  GUNNED DOWN WHEN THEY'RE IN A TOURIST RESORT.
BUT WHAT WAS THAT WORTH IT?
YES.
WAS IT WORTH GIVING UP YOUR  FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS JUST TO NOT  GET SHOT IN A GUN MASSACRE?
WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) ARE YOU  TALKING ABOUT?
AUSTRALIANS MUST NOW LIVE IN  THIS WELL-REGULATED NIGHTMARE  BECAUSE OF EX-POLITICIANS LIKE ROB WHO SMUGGLING THINKS HIS  COUNTRY HAS SOMETHING TO TEACH  US.
I HOPE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A  LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.
WHY WOULD PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE  LIKE THIS?
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT WANT A  SAFER SOCIETIA TO LIVE IN.
BUT IT'S POINTLESS FOR US TO  STUDY THE AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE  BECAUSE THEIR FEAR OF GUN CONTROL BACK THEN HAS NO  PARALLELS WITH OURS. WHAT KIND OF THINGS WERE YOU  HEARING WHEN YOU SUGGEST GUN  CONTROL?
THAT GOVERNMENT WAS BECOMING  A DICTATORSHIP.
THAT'S ONE.
WE'RE TOLD THAT PEOPLE WOULD  NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND  THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR FAMILY.
ANOTHER THAT'S DEFINITELY  TWO.
THAT DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE  SOMEHOW IF GOVERNMENT DECIDES  THERE SHOULD BE A BACKGROUND  CHECK.
ALL RIGHT, THREE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO BE INVADED BY  THE INDONESIANS.
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. NO ONE IN AMERICA IS AFRAID OF  INDONESIANS. ARE THEY AFRAID OF MEXICANS AND  MUSLIMS COMING? MAYBE,. SURE, HE CLAIMS AUSTRALIANS WERE  ANGRY, BUT WHERE IS THE PROOF?
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ARE BEING  TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ANY  GUNS. ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE YOURS UP?
NO!
OKAY, THERE IS IT IS. BUT HOW DID THE ANGRY  CONSERVATIVES FEEL NOW?
MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS  THAT IT WAS AN IVORY ACTION BUT  AS TIME WENT ON, THE REGULATIONS WERE QUITE MANAGEABLE.
HOLD ON, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO  GIVE UP YOUR HIGH-POWERED GUN?
NO, BUT-- I FELT AS IF I HAD  A BIT OF A DUTY TO THE REST OF  SOCIETY.
AND IF YOU THINK THAT SOUNDS  BAT ( BLEEP ) CRAZY, THIS  EFFECTIVE GUN CONTROL WAS ENACTED BY CONSERVATIVE  OLITICIANS AGAINST THE WILL OFP  THEIR OWN BASE. OUR POLITICIANS ARE DIFFERENT. THANE THAT--
GUN CONTROL DOESN'T WORK.
OR EVEN IF IT DOES--
IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
AND TO BE FAIR.
JOHN HOWARD AND HIS DEPUTY  PRIME MINISTER TIM FISHER HAVE  HAD SINCE 1996 TO ENACT THEIR SWEEPING REFORMS.
IT LOOK LESS THAN THREE AND A  HALF MONTHS.
WHAT? WHAT?  !
THE MASSACRE WAS ON THE  28th OF APRIL IN 1996. IN A 12-WEEK PERIOD SHORTLY  FOLLOWING THAT, THE BULK OF THE  LEGISLATION WAS DEVISED, DRAFTED, DEBATED, AND  IMPLEMENTED.
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.
THERE ARE NO MASSACRES SINCE  1996.
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT, BUT IT  DOESN'T WORK. MY HEAD WAS SPINNING. I HAD TO CLEAR IT THE  TRADITIONAL AUSSIE WAY. NOT THAT WAY, A WALK-ABOUT.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS  SACROSANCT.
POLITICAL SUICIDE.
FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS.
WHAT THE ( BLEEP )? AFTER THREE DAYS IN THE BUSH  WITH A GUY THERE A KANGAROO SUIT  IT BECAME CLEAR WHAT THE REAL ISSUE WITH GUN CONTROL IN  AMERICA IS.
IF GUNS AREN'T THE PROBLEM,  FILL, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
PEOPLE.
PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM?
YES.
YOU KNOW WHAT? AFTER SPENDING GREAT AMOUNT OF  TIME WITH YOU, PHILLIP, I'M  STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S PARTIALLY TRUE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M GLAD YOU UNDERSTAND THAT  PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.
THAT IS BECOMING JUST  PAINFULLY OBVIOUS. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE ISSUE ON  OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE EARTH, I  DISCOVERED THAT IF AMERICANS REALLY DO WANT GUN CONTROL,  THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE THING THEY  CAN DO TO GET IT. MOVE TO AUSTRALIA.  ♪ YOU COME FROM THE LAND  DOWNUNDER  ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  JON OLIVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
