(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A UNITED  STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PRACTICE  JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR.   ( APPLAUSE )   THERE YOU GO. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE. Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING  HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. Jon: PLEASE. I APPRECIATE THE BOOK BY THE WAY  IS CALLED MY BELOVED WORLD. FIRST OF ALL, YOU MUST BE  EXHAUSTED TWO DAYS OF INAUGURAL  FESTIVITIES. YOU SWORE IN THE VICE PRESIDENT.
YESTERDAY? Jon: YESTERDAY  AND TODAY. Jon: WILL YOU DO IT AGAIN  TOMORROW UNTIL IT TAKES? HOW MANY TIMES? TALK ABOUT AS IN YOUR BOOK  YOU'RE A KID FROM THE BRONX. YOU COME OUT OF NOTHING. AND THERE YOU ARE. SITTING AT THE INAUGURATION OF  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES AND SWEARING IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT ARE THE EMOTIONS THAT GO  THROUGH YOUR MIND IN THAT  MOMENT?
IT IS THE MOST ETHEREAL  MOMENT IN THE WORLD. IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN OUT OF BODY  EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE ALMOST LOOKING AT  YOURSELF FROM ABOVE YOUR HEAD  DOWN. AND YOU'RE HOPING THAT NOBODY  PINCHES YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T  WANT TO WAKE UP.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHICH OF THE OTHER JUSTICES  WOULD BE THE PINCHER? YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER.
(LAUGHING)  Jon: I'M JUST GOING TO GO  THROUGH A LIST. IS THERE... DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT  TO REFLECT BACK ON GROWING UP  BECAUSE YOUR CHILDHOOD BY ANY ESTIMATION WAS A DIFFICULT ONE,  WAS ONE THAT YOU HAD TO OVERCOME  AN AWFUL LOT OF OBSTACLES. IS THAT AT THE FOREFRONT OF YOUR  MIND OR IS IT STILL JUST  FOUNDATIONAL IN YOUR BEING?
STILL FOUNDATIONAL. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE LAST  THREE-AND-A-HALF YEARS SINCE I  WAS NOMINATED TO THE COURT AND THEN APPOINTED HAVE BEEN A SORT  OF MAGICAL RIDE. WHEN YOU'RE THRUST INTO SORT OF  A WORLD STAGE, AS I HAVE BEEN,  YOU START GETTING A LITTLE AFRAID OF LOSING NOT THE  FOUNDATION -- BECAUSE THAT'S A  PART OF YOU -- BUT LOSING CONNECTION TO THE DEPTHS OF THAT  FOUNDATION. CAUGHT UP IN THE WORLD OF THIS  NEW LIFE. I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. THAT'S WHY I MADE TIME TO WRITE  THIS BOOK. REALLY THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF  THE BOOK WAS TO REMEMBER THE  REAL SONIA.
Jon: RIGHT  AND TO HAVE SOMETHING TO  REMIND ME OF IT AS I WAS MOVING  FORWARD. SO IT IS A PART OF ME. IT'S SO FUNDAMENTAL TO WHO I AM. THE CHILD I GREW UP BEING. BUT THERE'S ALSO NEW EXPERIENCES  I'M INCORPORATING, BUT I DON'T  WANT TO LOSE TRACK OF SONIA
Jon: IT WOULD BE INTERESTING  TO READ JUSTICE ROBERTS' DISSENT   DISSENT.
(LAUGHING). I WAS HOPING FOR A UNANIMOUS  DECISION.
Jon: YOU NEVER KNOW. OF ALL THE EXPERIENCES THAT YOU  GO THROUGH, SO MUCH OF IT IS  OVERCOMING OBSTACLES, DOING THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAY YOU  CAN'T. NOW YOU'RE IN WHAT IS ONE OF THE  MORE SECURE JOBS IN THE COUNTRY. IS THERE ANY KIND OF IMPULSE TO  TRULY JUST LET IT ALL HANG OUT  LIKE IN YOUR OPINION... YOU KNOW, IS IT DIFFICULT TO REMAIN  MEASURED AS A SUPREME COURT  JUSTICE, GIVEN THE LOFTY NATURE OF THE POSITION AND THE POWER  THAT COMES WITH IT?
IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF  HISTORY AS A JUDGE, THEN YOU  KNOW THAT WHAT LASTS IS THE FORCE OF IDEAS AND THE STRENGTH  OF YOUR EXPRESSION OF THEM. AND TO LET IT ALL HANG OUT  DOESN'T QUITE...
Jon: (LAUGHING).   ( APPLAUSE )   FAIR ENOUGH. IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR  DELIBERATIONS WITH YOUR FELLOW  JUSTICES THAT HAS SURPRISED YOU? IS IT THE CARE WITH WHICH EVEN  THE OPINIONS YOU DISAGREE WITH  ARE PUT TOGETHER AND YOU CAN BE IMPRESSED BY? IS IT THE INTELLECT OF THE OTHER  JUDICIAL GIANTS THAT YOU ARE IN  WITH? WHAT SURPRISED YOU ABOUT THE WAY  THAT THE COURT DOES IT?
THE PASSION. THE PASSION THAT ALL OF US HAVE. WE ARE ALL EQUALLY PASSIONATE  ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION, ABOUT  THE COUNTRY, ABOUT WHAT WE DO. IT'S WHAT LETS US PUT UP WITH  EACH OTHER. REALLY! NO, MORE THAN THAT, YOU BECOME  FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW  ARE WORKING AS YOU ARE BECAUSE OF THE LOVE OF WHAT YOU'RE  DOING. YOU CAN ACTUALLY DISAGREE, THE  SAME WAY YOU DO WITH A BROTHER  OR SISTER, AND YOU'LL READ IN MY BOOK THAT I SPENT A LOT OF TIME  BEATING UP MY BROTHER. BUT YOU DO IT IN WORDS. YOU DO IT IN POWERFUL MAJORITY  DECISIONS, POWERFUL DISSENT THAT  EXPRESSES THOSE PASSIONS AND WAYS THAT WE HOPE WILL CONVINCE  LEADERS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS  ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO I THINK THAT SURPRISED ME THE  MOST. YOU CAN SEE IT IF YOU COME VISIT  THE COURT AND WATCH ONE OF OUR  ARGUMENTS.
Jon: I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT. LISTEN, I'D HATE FOR YOU TO SAY  HERE'S WHAT SURPRISED ME. THESE GUYS PHONE IT IN. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. CAN YOU STICK AROUND? WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT  MORE. ME BELOVED WORLD IS ON THE BOOK  SHELVES NOW. A GREAT STORY. JUSTICE SONIA
