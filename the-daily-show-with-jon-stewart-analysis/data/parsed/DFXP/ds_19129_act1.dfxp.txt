FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF MY FAVORITES.  ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDIANS IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, YOUNG JERRY SEINFELD WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. HE'S VERY TALENTED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] A TOP DOG. BUT FIRST, IF YOU'RE LIKE MANY OF OUR VIEWERS, YOU ASK ME IF I LIKE GETTING BLOWN. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. [LAUGHTER] WEIRD. SOMETIMES THE Q&A IN THE BEGINNING GETS A LITTLE OUT OF HAND IS WHAT I'M SAYING, BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE MANY OF OUR VIEWERS, YOU'RE PROBABLY WATCHING THIS SHOW RIGHT NOW WHILE DRIVING. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, STOP! VERY DANGEROUS, NOT BECAUSE IT PULLS YOUR FOCUS FROM THE ROAD BUT BECAUSE OF THE ROAD ITSELF.
THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IS ABOUT TO BECOME INSOLVENT.
Jon: OH, MY GOD! [LAUGHTER] FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T BELIEVE OUR FEDERAL HIGHWAYS HAVE A TRUST FUND. GET A JOB. YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T PULL THEMSELVES UP FROM GRAVEL JUST TO HAVE YOU LAY THERE. WELL, ACTUALLY... NOW, I KNOW OUR FEDERAL HIGHWAYS ARE THE VITAL CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF OUR NATION'S COMMERCE, BUT WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS IF IT LOSES ITS TRUST FUND?
THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RUNS DRY NEXT MONTH. UPKEEP AND REPAIRS NEEDED FOR AN AGING HIGHWAY SYSTEM. 65% OF ROADS ARE IN LESS-THAN-GOOD CONDITION. 25% OF BRIDGES NEED SIGNIFICANT REPAIR. THIS BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN WASHINGTON STATE IS A CAUTIONARY TALE.
Jon: HMM. [LAUGHTER] WELL, WHAT IF INSTEAD OF FUNDING OUR HIGHWAY SYSTEM, WE JUST DON'T TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON STATE? [LAUGHTER]
IF WE DON'T PASS THIS TRANSPORTATION BILL NOW, A LOT OF VERY BAD THINGS HAPPEN VERY SOON.
Jon: DID YOU JUST [BLEEPED] THREATEN ME? IS THAT WHAT YOU DID? "YOU KNOW WHAT OUR HIGHWAY SYSTEM GIVES ME? ENTHUSIASMS." [LAUGHTER] WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS... UH, UH, UH... THAT'S NICE... I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. THAT'S A NICE ONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. TAKE YOUR TIME. LOOK, THIS WHOLE CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE THING, WE HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS, UM, WHAT DO THEY CALL THOSE, IT'S LIKE A FLAT THING? YOU DRIVE ON THEM? THERE'S ONE THAT HAS YELLOW BRICKS. WHERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T NEED THEM. ONE OF THEM GOES TO WELLVILLE. ANYWAY, CONGRESS IS PRESENTED WITH A PRESSING PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES SOME MONEY. WE KNOWS HOW THIS GOES, A YEAR AND A HALF AND TWO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS LATER THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE AND A COUPLE OF 80-YEAR-OLDS ARE CAUGHT TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL.
LAWMAKERS IN THE HOUSE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY TO EXTEND HIGHWAY FUNDING WITH NEARLY $11 BILLION.
THAT KEEPS TRANSPORTATION FUNDING GOING THROUGH MAY OF NEXT YEAR.
PUTTING OFF THE LARGER ISSUE SO IT CAN BE FOUGHT OVER YET AGAIN. [BLEEPED] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO THEY THREW A LITTLE MONEY IT, JUST A LITTLE BIT, AND THEN JUST KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE -- OH, WHAT IS THAT THING CALLED THAT YOU KICK THE... IT'S PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS? I WENT TO PERDITION ON IT. NO. THAT'S JUST... BOY... [LAUGHTER] I HAVE...NO, NO, NO, I HAVE LIKE, HONESTLY, WE WROTE LIKE 100 OF THESE. I CAN'T EVEN... I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT I CAN'T EVEN PUT YOU THROUGH IT ANYMORE. I MEAN TO REMEMBER THIS WORD YOU'D HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF, OH, WHAT KIND OF SCHOLAR IS THAT? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I FEEL DIRTY. [LAUGHTER] SO WHY DID THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RUN OUT OF MONEY ANYWAY? HOW DO WE NORMALLY FUND THIS THING?
THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND GETS REVENUE FROM AN 18.4 CENT PER GALLON GAS TAX SET BACK IN 1993. BUT 21 YEARS LATER, THE TAX HAS STAYED FLAT.
WHAT? 1993. FOR GOD'S SAKE, BACK THEN GAS WAS $1.70 A GALLON, A CAR WAS $11,000 AND GETTING BLOWN IN THE BACK OF ONE WAS CONSIDERED THE HEIGHT OF SOPHISTICATION. [LAUGHTER] SO WAIT. THIS IS, THIS IS EASY THEN. TO FUND THE HIGHWAYS, ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS RAISE THE GAS TAX, AND THAT WOULD -- [ALARM SOUNDS]  SHUT THAT OFF! I'M JUST SAYING, IF WE TRACKED IT WITH INFLATION IT WOULD BE UP TO 30 CENTS A GALLON NOW, SO JUST BY RAISING THE GAS TAX -- [ALARM SOUNDS] OH, SON OF A BITCH. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, IT IS?
I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED RAISING THE GAS TAX. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO A LONG-TERM HIGHWAY BILL HERE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS.
THIS IS SO STUPID. WE'VE PAID FOR OUR HIGHWAYS WITH THE GAS TAX SINCE THE START OF THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM. PRESIDENT OBAMA, TELL THE REPUBLICANS TO SUCK IT UP AND GET THAT GAS TAX BACK UP TO WHERE IT'S MEANT TO BE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLAN ALSO MAKES NO MENTION OF THE GAS TAX.
Jon: SON OF A... AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A TAX-AND-SPEND LIBERAL. HOW YOU GOING TO PAY FOR THIS?
WE PAY FOR THIS TRANSPORTATION PROJECT IN PART BY CLOSING TAX LOOPHOLES FOR COMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS AND AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES.
Jon: INTERESTING. CERTAINLY TO ONE WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE. [LAUGHTER] WHO SEEMINGLY FORGOT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER IN HER LIVING ROOM AND THOUGHT, WHY NOT JUST SHOUT AT THE TV WHILE I'M AT IT. [LAUGHTER] AMAZINGLY, IF WE WANT TO GET TO POINT A IN SOLVING TRUST FUND WITH CRUMBLING BRIDGES TO POINT B, SOLVENT TRUST FUND WITH FIXED BRIDGES, WE CAN TAKE A DIRECT ROUTE, RAISE THE GAS TAX WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION, OR MAKE A SLIGHT DETOUR THROUGH OFF-SHORE LOOPHOLE BOULEVARD. THESE ARE TWO REASONABLE AND EFFICACIOUS WAYS OF FIXING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO HOW DID WE ACTUALLY RAISE THE $11 BILLION STOPGAP MEASURE, A MORE ECONOMICAL FIX THAT DOESN'T COME WITH ALL THE FEATURES LIKE POWER WINDOWS OR FIXED BRIDGES?
TO RAISE THAT MONEY THE PLAN WOULD USE AN APPROACH CALLED PENSION SMOOTHING, WHICH ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO DELAY CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSIONS PLANS. THAT GENERATES MORE TAX DOLLARS SINCE PENSION PAYMENTS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
Jon: OH, PENSION SMOOTHING. I'VE NEVER HEARD [BLEEPED] CALLED "SMOOTHING" BEFORE. SO INSTEAD OF GOING DIRECTLY FROM POINT A TO POINT B, WHICH IS HOW WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT, INSTEAD OF GOING DIRECTLY FROM POINT A TO POINT B OR EVEN JUST TAKING A ONE MINOR ROUTE, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING, PENSION SMOOTHING. BASICALLY COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO REDUCE THEIR PENSION OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES, THUS GIVING THEM A HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN ON WHICH THEY PAY MORE TAX. FOR THIS YEAR, TO THE TUNE OF $11 BILLION. OF COURSE, IF THEY'RE EVENTUALLY TO MAKE GOOD ON THOSE PENSION OBLIGATIONS, THEY WILL GET TO CLAIM MUCH HIGHER TAX BREAKS IN THE FUTURE, AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE THAT MONEY. ONCE AGAIN LIVING UP TO THE MOTTO, OVER THE CAPITOL BUILDING'S DOOR A LATIN PHRASE MEANING: [BLEEPED] IT, WE'LL PROBABLY ALL BE DEAD IN TEN YEARS ANYWAY. ALRIGHT, YOU KNOW, IT'S CRAZY HOW THE WEALTHIEST MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE EXPENDING ALL ITS ENERGY TO GET ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. IF ONLY THIS HIGHWAY FUNDING SITUATION PROVIDED MAYBE A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW WE OPERATE.
IT'S SO EXCITING. I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE ROAD IN A LONG TIME.
MR. OBAMA SEEMED TO ENJOY HIS MOMENT OF VIRTUAL FREEDOM. THE PRESIDENT DROVE EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY IN A SIMULATOR. HE BUCKLED UP AND CRUISED DOWN A VIRTUAL HIGHWAY.
Jon: YEP. IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE, BUT WE AIN'T. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
