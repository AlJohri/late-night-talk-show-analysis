FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST SIR PAUL MCCARTNEY IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TO TALK A LITTLE LATER ON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALL KNOW THE ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF OUR UNITED STATES CONGRESS [BEEP] HATE EACH OTHER. [LAUGHING] IN FACT THE ONLY THING LOWER THAN CONGRESS' APPROVAL RATING AMONGST THE PUBLIC IS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER. THERE'S A LOT OF SWIPING LEFT. BUT NOW AS THE NEW YEAR FAST APPROACHES THEY MUST ENACT A VARIETY OF LAST MINUTE ITEMS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THE ONE TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP BASTING IN THEIR OWN HATEFUL JUICES.  THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER.
WE HAVE SOME IMPORTANT STUFF TO DO. WE COULD COMPLETE EVERYTHING IF WE WANTED TO TODAY. I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME, MR. PRESIDENT, IN SUCH A LONG TIME. AND I WANT TO GO HOME. I BOUGHT A NEW HOME THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE HOME. I HAVE NOT SLEPT IN IT. WE BOUGHT IT IN MAY. I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE. [LAUGHING]
Jon: YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HOME IN SUCH A LONG TIME. YOU JUST HAD A BREAK OVER THANKSGIVING, FOR GOD'S SAKES. YOU'RE NOT WASHINGTON ADDRESSING THE TROOPS BEFORE HEADING BACK TO MOUNT VERNON. OH, MR. PRESIDENT, I MISS MY HOME. [LAUGHING]  IT'S A GOOD HOME. IT'S SPLIT LEVEL, COLONIAL. IF IT PLEASES THE SENATE I SHOULD WOULD LIKE TO OPEN A FRONT DOOR AND ENTER HER. OH, WHO AM I KIDDING HER BACK DOOR, IT'S FINE. I DON'T CARE. I HAVEN'T BEEN HOME IN SOME TIME. SO, DID THE POET LAUREATE OF NEVADA REAL ESTATE GET GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS?
CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATORS HAVE REACHED A DEAL  TO AVERT A GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.
A 1.1 TRILLION DOLLAR SPENDING BILL FUNDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH NEXT SEPTEMBER.
A BILL THAT WILL KEEP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S LIGHTS ON.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT HERE IS A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO IT'S NOT. HARRY REID HAS BEEN HOME JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO, AND THIS IS NOT -- I KNOW THAT EXPECTATIONS FOR CONGRESS ARE LOW. BUT THE ONLY WAY KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON IS A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT IS IF YOU'RE A MACCABEE AND YOUR MENORAH HAS BUT ONE NIGHT OF OIL -- TO EVERYONE'S ASTONISHMENT THE GOVERNMENT LIGHTS BURNED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR. AND THAT IS WHY WE CELEBRATE THE MIRACLE OF CONGRESSICA BUDGETICA. WE GOT A BUDGET. WHAT ARE WE GOING INTO DEBT FOR THIS YEAR?
ON IMMIGRATION, THE BILL INCLUDES AT LEAST $1.2 BILLION. $521 BILLION FOR THE MILITARY.
$5.4 BILLION TO COMBAT EBOLA.
IT ALSO BLOCKS A PAY RAISE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT. SORRY JOE BIDEN.
Jon: SORRY, JOE BIDEN. MY GUESS IS HE HEARS THAT PHRASE A LOT. SIR, WE CAN NOT SERVE YOU WITHOUT A SHIRT, SORRY JOE BIDEN. THIS METER DOES NOT ACCEPT CHUCKIE CHEESE TOKENS. SORRY, JOE BIDEN. ANYWAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE PRETTY STANDARD BUDGET STUFF IN THERE.
BUDGET CUTS FOR THE IRS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.
THIS WOULD DO AWAY WITH THE BAN ON TRADITIONAL INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS.
STOPPING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FROM LEGALIZING MARIJUANA.
Jon: WAIT, STOPPING PEOPLE FROM SMOKING POT'S A BUDGET THING? I THOUGHT THAT WAS MORE OF A GIRLFRIEND OR BOYFRIEND THING. THOSE LAST THINGS SOUNDED LESS LIKE BUDGET ITEMS AND MORE LIKE, I DONT KNOW, LAWS. WHAT OTHER NON BUDGETARY ITEMS ARE IN THE BUDGET?
FARMERS WILL NOT HAVE TO OBTAIN METHANE EMISSION PERMITS.
TWO KINDS OF BIRDS CAN NO LONGER BE DECLARED ENDANGERED.
LONGER HOURS FOR TRUCKERS.
A FEDERAL PROGRAM CAN NOW CALL WHITE POTATOES A FRESH VEGETABLE.
Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP) IS THAT? IN THE BUDGET NOW YOU CAN JUST MAKE UP WORDS? THE ARMY CAN NOW CALL BULLETS INGESTIBLE IRON SUPPLEMENTS. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH -- HOW DID THAT RANDOM STUFF END UP IN THE BUDGET?
A LOT OF LAW MAKERS USE THIS OPPORTUNITY A MUST PASS BILL TO SLIP IN A LOT OF SPECIAL INTEREST PROVISIONS THAT THEY PROBABLY COULDN'T GET PASSED ON THEIR OWN. AND SOME OF THEM CAME IN, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING.
Jon: WHAT? THEY JUST WAIT UNTIL NOBODY IS LOOKING AND THEN JUST SLIP THIS TOXIC STUFF IN? WHAT ARE THEY, THE BILL COSBY OF LEGISLATION? [LAUGHING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GUILTY, INNOCENT. GUILTY, INNOCENT. GUILTY -- [LAUGHING] ALTHOUGH I IMAGINE YOU CALL IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
IT'S CALLED A CHRISTMAS TREE. [LAUGHING]
Jon: AND IS THERE ANYTHING MORE MAGICAL THAN A LOOK ON A CONGRESS PERSON'S FACE WHEN THEY COME RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRS TO SEE WHAT THEY GOT THEMSELVES? YOU KNOW, ANOTHER WAY THIS BUDGET IS LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE: LIBERALS WANT TO DESTROY IT.
THE BIGGEST ITEM THAT RILED UP PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS WAS THE BILL'S REVERSING OF NEW REGULATIONS ON BIG BANKS AND DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, THE KIND THAT NEARLY IMPLODED THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN 2008.
THAT PART OF THE LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN BY CITIGROUP.
Jon: WOW. WELL, OF COURSE THEY HAD TO HIDE THE CITIGROUP WRITTEN PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL. EITHER THAT OR TRY TO GET GET CONGRESS TO PASS THE WE NEVER LEARN OUR [BEEP] LESSON ACT OF 2014. WHY WOULD THE CONGRESS SNEAK IN A PROVISION THAT BASICALLY WAS JUST AN ENORMOUS GIVEAWAY TO BIG BANKS? WHAT DOES CONGRESS GET ALMOST DIRECTLY IN RETURN FOR THIS FAVOR/INVESTMENT.
A LAST MINUTE CHANGE FROM THE TOP REPUBLICAN LEADERS TO ALTER CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES SO BIG DONORS CAN GIVE TEN TIMES MORE MONEY. UP TO $324,000.
Jon: BUT NOT A PENNY MORE. OBVIOUSLY I SHOULDN'T INSINUATE THAT RAISING THE PERSONAL DONOR LIMIT TO $324,000 IS TANTAMOUNT TO PAY BACK FOR INCREASING THE BANK'S PROFITS. REALLY, ANY INDIVIDUAL COULD GIVE $324,000, BE THEY A WALL STREET BANKER WHO BENEFITED FROM THIS CONGRESSIONAL LARGESSE OR THE LOCAL JANITOR WHO IS LOOKING TO BANKRUPT HIMSELF. [LAUGHING] BUT NOT EVERYONE IN CONGRESS IS HAPPY WITH THESE SECRET DODD FRANK ROLLING BACK SHENANIGANS.
THAT'S WHY I WAS SO REALLY HEARTBROKEN. I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER SAID THAT WORD ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. HEARTBROKEN TO SEE THE TAINT THAT WAS PLACED ON THIS VALUABLE APPROPRIATIONS BILL. [LAUGHING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT THE GESTURE SHE USED AFTER SAYING THE WORD "TAINT" WAS. HOW SHORT IS SHE? [LAUGHING]  I'M SORRY. ALRIGHT. IS THERE, IS THERE -- IS THERE SOMEONE IN CONGRESS WHO CAN NOT APPEAL TO ME IN SUCH AN ADOLESCENT WAY.
WHO DOES CONGRESS WORK FOR? DOES IT WORK FOR THE MILLIONAIRES? THE BILLIONAIRES? OR DOES IT WORK FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE? IT IS TIME FOR ALL OF US TO STAND UP AND FIGHT.
Jon: IT'S SO CUTE. SHE THINKS SHE CAN CHANGE THE SYSTEM. [LAUGHING] FRESHMEN. WELL, DON'T WORRY ONE OF THE MEAN GIRLS WILL GET HER BACK IN LINE. >>TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM MASSACHUSETS, THERE IS SOMETHING IN HERE YOU DON'T LIKE, WELCOME TO DEMOCRACY. [LAUGHING]
Jon: WHAT, WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU DON'T LIKE IT -- THAT IS DEMOCRACY. SO, HE SAYS, LINDSAY GRAHAM SAYS WELCOME TO DEMOCRACY. BUT HERE'S THE THING, THAT'S NOT DEMOCRACY. DEMOCRACY IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN CONGRESS PASSED DODD FRANK, FOLLOWING A VIGOROUS OPEN DEBATE AND BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE. WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK IS SOMEONE ANONYMOUSLY REPEALING PART OF THAT AGREEMENT BY SNEAKING IT INTO AN UNRELATED MUST-PASS BILL. IT'S DEMOCRACY IN THE SAME WAY THAT CHEESE WHIZ IS CHEESE. IT LOOKS KIND OF SIMILAR FROM A DISTANCE BUT IT SURE TASTES LIKE SOMEONE'S TAINT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
