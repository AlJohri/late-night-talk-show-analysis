(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WITH THE THIRD DEBATE  OUT OF THE WAY CAMPAIGN NOW  ENTERS ITS FINAL PHASE SO WE  TURN TO JOHN OLIVER AND AASIF MANDVI, THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING  THE TWO CAMPAIGNS. TIME FOR THE END GAME. GENTLEMEN, HOW ARE YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU TWO HAVE BEEN ON THE BUS  WITH BOTH CAMPAIGNS. THESE CAMPAIGNS ARE FINALLY  MAKING THEIR CLOSING STATEMENTS  OF THIS ELECTION. JOHN OLIVER, LET'S START WITH  YOU. WHAT IS OBAMA CAMPAIGN'S CLOSING  SPEECH AND PITCH TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE?
SIMPLY THIS, JOHN. THE OBAMA CAMP FEELS THE CHOICE  IS SIMPLE. MAYBE OBAMA HASN'T BEEN THE  PRESIDENT YOU WANTED HIM TO BE. PERHAPS HE DIDN'T MEET THE HIGH  EXPECTATIONS HE SET HIMSELF. BUT THE OTHER GUY, JON, IS A  TOTAL DICK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I MEAN THAT. JON, HE'S A SIX-FOOT SHAFT WITH  TINY BALLSES FOR FEET. HE MAY NOT FIRE YOU HIMSELF BUT  YOU KNOW THAT WHEN HE'S LOOKING  AT YOU HE'S UNEMPLOYING YOU WITH  HIS EYES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, JON,  I'M GOING TO STARE AT AASIF  WHILE HE'S TALKING, THEREBY DOMINATING HIM VISUALLY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELL, ALL RIGHT, SEEMS  LIKE A RELATIVELY LOW-BROW  CLOSING ARGUMENT FROM THE OBAMA  CAMPAIGN. AASIF, YOU'VE BEEN WITH THE  ROMNEY CAMPAIGN. WHAT'S THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENT?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO  BE? (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LOOK, JON, UM, MITT ROMNEY HAS  BEEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT FOR  SEVEN YEARS. THESE ARE TWO SHORT WEEKS LEFT  IN THE CAMPAIGN. THE POLLS ARE NARROWING IN KEY  STATES. HE JUST NEEDS TO PICK UP A FEW  MORE VOTES TO LOCK THIS THING  DOWN. SO AT THIS POINT, HE REALLY  WANTS TO KNOW WHAT INDIVIDUALS  THINK SO HE CAN THINK IT, TOO. BECAUSE, JON, HE REALLY, REALLY  WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT DOES SEEM LIKE IF  I MAY SAY SO, AND I DON'T -- AND  I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE,  JOHN. A BREATH TAKINGLY CYNICAL  TACTIC.
YOU THINK SO? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DO.
WELL, THEN MITT ROMNEY DOES,  TOO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HE ALWAYS HAS SINCE DAY ONE.
OH, COME ON, JON, HE'S JUST  BEING A DICK! I'M TELLING YOU, SALT AND PEPPER  PUBIC HAIR. REAL DICK! REAL DICK!
Jon: I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT  BY CALLING EVERYONE A DICK ALL  THE TIME I THINK THE OBAMA  CAMPAIGN'S CLOSING ARGUMENT COMES ACROSS A LITTLE DICKISH,  QUITE FRANKLY.
NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T CALL  THEM A DICK FOR CALLING OUT A  DICK, JON. YOU CAN'T CALL DOUBLE-DICK. (LAUGHTER)  YOU CAN'T DO IT.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT IS RIDICULOUS, JON. IT'S NOT THE KIND OF VALUES  GOVERNOR ROMNEY GREW UP WITH AS  A LOST JEWISH KID IN CENTRAL  JERSEY.
Jon: WHAT? WAIT! WHAT?
GOVERNOR ROMNEY LEARNED  DURING HIS DAYS LISTENING TO  BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IN A --
Jon: WHAT?
IN A HAZE OF POT SMOKE  DREAMING OF BECOMING A STAND UP  COMEDIAN.
Jon: OH, MY GOD! THAT'S JUST LIKE MY LIFE. I DIDN'T KNOW ROMNEY WAS SO  RELATABLE!
JON, YOU SEE WHAT HE'S DOING! THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF  ROMNEY'S BIOGRAPHY, THIS IS  ABOUT HARD EXPERIENCE. YOU'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT, HE'S  BEEN EVERYWHERE. FROM PAH-KEE-STAHN, TO  BRA-SEE-O, TO (SOUTHERN ACCENT)  SOUTH CAROLINA AND OF COURSE  (SOUTHERN ACCENT)  AUSTRALIA.
Jon: (LAUGHS)  THAT'S HOW AUSTRALIANS SAY  AUSTRALIA?
THEY DO IF THEY'RE FROM SOUTH  CAROLINA, JON, YES.
Jon: PRONOUNCING THESE  DIFFERENT REGIONS LIKE YOU'RE A  SOPHOMORE JUST BACK FROM A  SEMESTER ABROAD IS PRETENTIOUS. IT'S A LITTLE DICKISH.
JON, THIS IS NO TIME FOR NAME  CALLING AND, IN FACT, GOVERNOR  ROMNEY UNDERSTANDS JOHN OLIVER'S  FRUSTRATION. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S A FEELING THAT'S BEEN  NAGGING AT HIM SINCE HE WAS A  SCRAPPY LITTLE STREET RAT  SELLING PAPERS FOR TUPPENCE IN CHITTANY SQUARE. CAN. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT?
(IN A COCKNEY ACCENT) THAT'S  THE LIFE WOT I LIVED!
