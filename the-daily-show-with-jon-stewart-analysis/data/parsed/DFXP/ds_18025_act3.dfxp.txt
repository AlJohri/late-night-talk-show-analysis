Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT A PULITZER  PRIZE WINNING BEST SELLING  AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THOMAS  JEFFERSON: THE ART OF POWER."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JON MEACHAM. SIR, COME ON OUT HERE! WHO'S BETTER THAN US? SIT.
WELL, I COULD START.
Jon: I KNOW, MANY PEOPLE. JON MEACHAM, THANKS FOR JOINING  US.
THANK YOU.
Jon: "THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE  ART OF POWER."  LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT PICTURE. THAT WAS A GOOD-LOOKING DUDE.
HE WAS A GOOD-LOOKING DUDE.
Jon: YOU WROTE HE PROVIDED  OVER THE COUNTRY DURING A TIME  OF DEEP PARTISAN DIVIDE AND REAL ANTAGONISM IN THIS COUNTRY. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A PRESENT  WHO HASN'T PRESIDED --
NO, JAMES MONROE.
Jon: REALLY?
THERE WAS AN ERA OF GOOD  FEELINGS. FEDERALISM -- ONE OF THE  ACHIEVEMENTS OF JEFFERSON IS HIS  REPUBLICANISM REALLY DROVE FEDERALISTS MAD, WHICH IS NOT  ALSO -- WHICH IS ALSO INITIALLY  AN ANALOGY RIGHT NOW.
Jon: WELL, LET'S DEFINE  REPUBLICANISM AND FEDERALISM AS  THEY GO.
REPUBLICANISM WAS THE VOICE  OF THE MANY OVER THE FEW. AND FEDERALISTS WERE SORT OF  PROTO BRITISH, MUCH MORE --
Jon: ELITIST?
AUTHORITARIAN, ELITIST. IT WAS BASED IN NEW ENGLAND AND  IN SOUTH CAROLINA. WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN TROUBLE.
Jon: AND MORE RELIGIOUS. IT WAS A MORE RELIGIOUS BASED --  HE WAS MORE OF YOUR  ENLIGHTENMENT TYPE FELLOW.
IT WAS HIS DOING THAT MOVED  THE WALL METAPHOR, THE  SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE, INTO THE VERNACULAR IN A  LETTER TO THE DANBURY BAPTIST  ASSOCIATION AND THAT WAS A CRITICAL THING. HE -- ON HIS RELIGIOUS VIEWS HE  WAS A -- SOMEWHAT OF A SKEP I  CAN. HE DESCRIBED CHRISTIANITY AS THE  MERE ABRACADABRA OF MEN CALLING  THEMSELVES PRIESTS OF JESUS. (LAUGHTER)  HE DIDN'T DO WELL AT LIBERTY.
Jon: SO WHEN HE WENT TO GO  AT SPEAK AT FALWELL UNIVERSITY,  HOW DID THAT GO OVER?
IT WASN'T --
Jon: NOT A BIG HIT. HE WAS CALLED AN ATHEIST AT A  TIME.
AN ATHEIST IN RELIGION AND A  FANATIC IN POLITICS BY ALEXANDER  HAMILTON OF WHOM JEFFERSON RESPONDED AFTER SAYING THAT THEY  WERE DAILY PITTED IN THE CABINET  LIKE TWO COCKS CONSTANTLY AT EACH OTHER.
Jon: SURE. (LAUGHTER)  THAT WILL HAPPEN IN A CABINET. (LAUGHTER)
PRESSING ON --
Jon: PLEASE. (LAUGHTER)  AM I SOILING YOUR PULITZER. (LAUGHTER)  I'M GETTING A LITTLE TARNISH ON  YOUR PULITZER.
PLEASE DON'T SAY "SOIL."  (LAUGHTER)  AS A FAVOR.
Jon: YOU GIVE AS GOOD AS  YOU GET THERE.
AS A FAVOR, BABY. AND THEN SKWROFR SON RESPONDED  BY SAYING HE DECLINED TO HAVE  HIS REPUTATION SLANDERED BY A MAN FOR WHOM HISTORY FROM THE  MOMENT HISTORY COULD STOOP TO  NOTICE HIM-- WITH HAMILTON, WHO WAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD-- HAD  NOT ONLY RECEIVED HIS --  RECEIVED HIM INTO THE COUNTRY BUT HAD HEAPED HIS HONORS ON HIS  HEAD. AND ALL THAT HAMILTON HAD DONE  TO REPAY FOR THIS WAS TO ISSUE A  TISSUE OF MACHINATIONS AGAINST THE LIBERTY OF THE COUNTRY.
Jon: WOW!
SO IT WAS FUN. I KNOW THAT WE THINK --
THE SNAPS THAT THESE GUYS  DELIVERED! (LAUGHTER)  ON EACH OTHER.
IT WAS GOOD.
Jon: THEY WERE AT SUCH A  LEVEL. SUCH A -- THEY WERE OLYMPIAN IN  THEIR SNAPS. (LAUGHTER)
IT WAS --
THERE'S NO "YO MAMA --" LIKE  NONE OF THAT.
IT WAS NOT -- WHEN THOMAS  JEFFERSON WENT AFTER A POLITICAL  OPPONENT IT WAS NOT "HOW'S THAT HOPEY CHANGEY THING WORKING OUT  FOR YOU?"  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE INTERESTING THING  TO ME ABOUT JEFFERSON IS THE  NARRATIVE OF HIS LIFE IS A REAL FOCUS ON ENLIGHTENMENT. OF BRINGING REASON. WE FIND OURSELVES IN CONSPIRACY  TIMES ONCE AGAIN.
AND FUNDAMENTALISM.
AND FUNDAMENTALISM. IS IT HARD NOT TO THINK IN YOUR  MIND "WHAT WOULD JEFFERSON MAKE  OF THIS? WOULD HE CONSIDER THIS A MILD  CASE OF THIS ILLNESS? WOULD HE CONSIDER IT FULL  BLOWN?"
HE WAS AN AMATEUR EVERYTHING. THIS IS A GUY WHO LOVED WINE,  WOMEN, SONG, ARCHITECTURE, ART  GARDENING, AGRICULTURE, AND MEDICINE WAS ONE OF THEM AND HE  READ A LOT. HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A GOOD  GUY IF HE WERE A DOCTOR ON  webmd.com.
Jon: I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I'M ON IT A LOT.
THE MEDICAL STUFF.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
LOOKING STUFF UP. HE WAS ALWAYS ANALYZING,  DIAGNOSING HIMSELF.
Jon: HE HAD THAT GREAT  STORY ABOUT SOMEBODY MEETS HIM  AND WHEN THEY SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT MEDICINE AND WHEN THEY TALK  ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGY THEY THINK  HE'S AN -- AND THEN THEY SPEAK ABOUT RELIGION AND THINK HE HE'S  A PRIEST AND THEY GO TO THE INN  KEEPER AFTER --
AND THEY SAID WHO IS THAT  MAN? AND THE INN KEEPER SAID "I  THOUGHT YOU KNEW MR. JEFFERSON."  THERE WAS REMARKABLE INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY  INCULCATED AND CULTIVATED AT  WILLIAM & MARY IN WILLIAMSBURG WHICH HE LOVED. IT WAS A TRANSFORMATIVE  EXPERIENCE FOR HIM.
Jon: HE AND I ARE JUST SO  SIMILAR IN NATURE. (LAUGHTER)
I KNOW, I KNOW. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I'M CURIOUS HOW MUCH  TIME HE SPENT THERE HIGH. BECAUSE I KNOW FOR ME -- CAN YOU  STICK AROUND?
SURE.
Jon: I WANT TO TALK A  LITTLE BIT MORE. JEFFERSON IS TRULY SUCH A  SEMINAL FIGURE IN THE FOUNDING  OF OUR COUNTRY.
AND HIS VIEWS DO SPEAK TO  WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW.
Jon: NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. "THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE ART OF  POWER."  IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. FASCINATING. JON MEACHAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
