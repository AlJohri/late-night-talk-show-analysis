(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "CONFIDENCE MEN: WALL STREET, WASHINGTON, AND THE EDUCATION OF A PRESIDENT." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW RON SUSKIND. (APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU. "CONFIDENCE MEN: WALL STREET, WASHINGTON" AND, OF COURSE, THE EDUCATION OF A PRESIDENT. I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE EDUCATION OF A PRESIDENT TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAPPEN  PREVIOUS TO THEIR PRESIDENTING. THIS REPRESENTS A VERY CREDIBLE CASE THAT HE WAS A FRESHMAN AND RECEIVED WHAT MAY BE PERCEIVED  AS AN ECONOMIC TEAM WEDGIE. (LAUGHTER) YOUR THOUGHTS.
WHATEVER YOU SAID, I THINK THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. HE ARRIVES HERE AS AN UNTESTED LEADER IN A LOT OF WAYS. I CALL HIM AN AMATEUR PRESIDENT. HE IS BRILLIANT, HE IS SOMEONE PEOPLE PAINT YEARNINGS ON, HE RISES AT A MOMENT OF CRISIS AND  HE SURROUNDS HIMSELF WHEN HE HAS A KIND OF COLD SWEAT MOMENT WITH OLD SEASONED HANDS-- MANY OF  THEM FROM BILL CLINTON-- AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS, WELL, WHAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM. PEOPLE WILL FEEL SOME SYMPATHY FOR HIM, ACTUALLY MAYBE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR WHAT BARACK OBAMA  FACED AT THIS MOMENT BASED ON WHAT HE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE, UNDERSTANDABLY. AND IT'S QUITE A BATTLE THROUGH THE TWO YEARS. NOW OBAMA SAYS IN THE FINAL INTERVIEW "I'VE GROWN. YES, WHAT'S IN THE BOOK IS TRUE BUT I'VE LEARNED HARD LESSONS  FROM THIS AND I'VE BECOME THE PRESIDENT PEOPLE WANT AND DESERVE."  BUT THAT WILL BE SOMETHING PEOPLE JUDGE.
Jon: WHY DO PEOPLE TALK TO YOU? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK TO YOU IN THIS BOOK.
EVERYBODY.
Jon: EVERYBODY GOES ON RECORD. DO THEY THINK IN THIS... ARE YOU THEIR CHANCE? ARE YOU A LIFE PRESERVER TO THEIR REPUTATION? DOES THE PRESIDENT... IS THE THOUGHT THAT WE WANT TO CHRONICLE THIS FOR HISTORICAL  PURPOSES OVERWHELM MAYBE A PRUDENT STEP BACK? WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS?
PEOPLE COME TO SOMEONE LIKE ME AND HAVE FOR NOW... THIS IS THE FIFTH BOOK. FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS, BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT A LOT OF THEM FEEL THAT THEY WERE FRONT  SEATS IN BIG MOMENTS OF HISTORY AND THEY SAY "I NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT I SAW."  NOW THE ADVISORS ARE INTERESTING AND THE BOOK IS FULL OF THEM BUT  THE REASON YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEM IS BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN, THE  PRESIDENT, THE DECIDER, SO TO SPEAK, INTO THE MAN OF THIS MOMENT AND THIS PERIOD.
Jon: RIGHT.
NOW INTERESTINGLY WHAT YOU FIND HERE IS OBAMA'S WRESTLING WITH HIS ADVISORS.
Jon: WELL, THERE'S A... PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IN THE BOOK FOR OBAMA IS THE SENSE THAT HE SITS BACK AND  ALLOWS WHAT WOULD BE HIS NATURAL INSTINCTS... YOU KNOW, YOU SAY HE PROMOTED THE SWEDISH MODEL  AND THEY WENT "NO" AND HE WENT "ALL RIGHT."
IT DOES NOT PAINT A STRONG LEADERSHIP POSITION FOR IT. IT'S INTERESTING, THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THIS PRESIDENCY IS CLEARLY THE CRUCIAL TIME. HE'S GOT A 75% APPROVAL RATING, TWO MILLION PEOPLE WERE WEEPING ON THE MALL IN JANUARY AND YOU CAN FEEL AND THINK I CAN DO THIS  I CAN BE THIS LARGER-THAN-LIFE PRESIDENT AND YOU SEE HIM KIND OF GETTING THE WIND KNOCKED OUT  OF HIM BY MARCH AND IT'S HARD TO READ BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HIM REACHING FOR BIG IDEAS, ESPECIALLY RESTRUCTURING, TAKING DOWN SOME OF THE BIG BANGS, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND AFTER THAT YOU HAVE MORE INCIDENTS LIKE THAT. ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO 2010, THE BEGINNING OF 2010 WHEN HE GETS A  MEMO, THERE'S LOTS OF MEMOS IN THERE FROM PETE ROUSE, THE TOP  ADVISOR SAYING "LOOK, YOU NEED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS BUILDING YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT."  AND THIS MEMO WAS KIND OF A BLUEPRINT FOR MOSTLY ALL THE STAFF, THE FIRST STAFF LEAVING  AND OBAMA AFTER THE MIDTERMS HE SAYS TO ME I FEEL LIKE NOW I'M  KIND OF GETTING MY RHYTHM, I'M HERE NOW. WITH A NEW STAFF THAT CAN DO WHAT I NEED BUT THAT'S FOR FOLKS TO JUDGE.
WELL, THE DIFFICULTTY HERE IS THE FEELING OF OPPORTUNITY SQUANDERED. THE HARDEST THING TO READ IN IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBAMA AS A CAMPAIGNER AND HOW HE... HE  REALLY DID REPUDIATE HIS OWN CAMPAIGN. HE RAN AS A GUY WHO SAID THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY IS HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE AND EXPECT  DIFFERENT RESULTS. AS SOON AS THE FINANCIAL CRISIS HIT-- AND IT DOESN'T HIT WHILE  HE'S IN OFFICE, IT'S BEFORE-- HE HIRES LARRY SUMMERS WHO, BY THE  WAY, I THINK BY UNANIMOUS CONSENT IS AN AS (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) LIKE I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING... (APPLAUSE) LIKE NORMFULLY THESE BOOKS... AND, BY THE WAY, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A PREJUDICE THING, LIKE  YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NARRATIVE. IT DOES FEEL FAIR-MINDED BUT, MAN, WHEN YOU INTERVIEWED, I THINK, HIS FAMILY AND THEY... NO, THAT'S NOT IN THERE. BUT...
WELL, HE SPEAKS SO HIGHLY OF YOU, JON.
Jon: REALLY. HE DOES? BUT IT'S ASTONISHING TO SEE SUCH A CLEAR PORTRAYAL OF ONE INDIVIDUAL.
THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM IN THIS MIX BUT, LARRY, LOOK, HE'S  OFTEN BEEN HIS OWN WORST ENEMY THROUGH A LONG PERIOD ON THE PUBLIC STAGE. HERE HE SAYS, OF COURSE, ONE OF THE SIGNATURE QUOTES OF THIS PERIOD WHICH IS THE FAMOUS NOW  "HOME ALONE" QUOTE. WE'RE HOME ALONE, THERE'S NO ADULT IN CHARGE AND CLINTON WOULD NEVER MAKE THESE MISTAKES. HE SAYS THIS A LOT LEAVING MEETINGS IN THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE PRESIDENT. LOTS OF PEOPLE HEAR THIS AND THEY'RE TROUBLED BY IT, THEY SAY IS LARRY RIGHT ABOUT THIS OR NOT? AND THEY WRESTLE WITH IT THROUGH THE PERIOD OF THIS PRESIDENCY.
BUT YOU SAY EVERYBODY HATES SUMMERS BUT OBAMA. THE ONE THING YOU KEEP COMING BACK TO IS HIS JUDGMENT NECESSARILY ON THE PEOPLE THAT  HE HAS AROUND HIM AS ADVISORS. THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY THE IRAQ WAR, HE'S GOT A SITUATION HE HAS INHERITED BUT HE IS  RESPONSIBLE... YOU CAN'T SIT BACK AND SAY HE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BAD ADVISE.
WITH LARRY THERE'S A SEDUCTION. OBAMA LOVES THESE HIGH I.Q. GUYS LARRY IS THE TOP OF THE HEAT THERE AND HE SORT OF ENDS UP IN  WHAT I CALL THE LARRY SUMMERS DEBATE SOCIETY. I THINK OBAMA FELT HE'D SIT ABOVE IT AND JUDGE WHO'S THE WINNER. HE'S JUST ANOTHER GUY AT THE TABLE. LARRY SAYING I'LL GO FIRST, YOU GO AFTER ME. IT TROUBLES PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING THERE SAYING WAIT A SECOND, IS THAT BEING  DISRESPECTFUL TO THE PRESIDENT? EVENTUALLY YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT'S CONFIDENCE SORT OF BRUISED AND, FRANKLY, THAT'S WHY  CONFIDENCE MEN IS THE TITLE. IT'S ALL ABOUT CONFIDENCE. THE COIN OF THE REALM.
Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE! YOU TURNED IT AROUND YOU'RE VERY GOOD. (LAUGHTER) I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE MORE THINGS, THIS WILL BE ON THE WEB. "CONFIDENCE MEN" IS THE NAME OF THE BOOK, RON SUSKIND.
