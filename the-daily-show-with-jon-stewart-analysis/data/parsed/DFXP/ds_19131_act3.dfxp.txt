[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT FOR "AL JAZEERA ENGLISH," PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM SUE TURTON.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
OH, PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
Jon: SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SEEN OVER THESE PAST FEW YEARS THE DANGERS OF BEING A JOURNALIST IN THESE VERY DIFFICULT REGIONS OF THE WORLD, BUT YOU ARE HERE SPECIFICALLY. THERE ARE THREE JOURNALISTS FROM AL JAZEERA WHO ARE BEING IMPRISONED. THEY'RE HELD RIGHT NOW IN EGYPT.
YEP.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT?
THESE GUYS WERE ARRESTED BACK ON THE TO THE 29th OF DECEMBER. AT THE TIME THERE WAS REAL CRACKDOWN GOING ON OF ALL THE MEDIA COVERING WHAT WAS GOING ON THE EGYPT.
Jon: YES.
I THINK IF YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS A COUP LAST YEAR WHEN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, MOHAMED MORSI WAS THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: YES.
HE WAS REMOVED FROM POWER.
Jon: I AM FAMILIAR.
YEAH, AND THE MILITARY TOOK OVER. AND, THEY BASICALLY WANT TO SHUT DOWN ANY DISSENT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon: MMHMM.
SO OUR GUYS WERE STILL OPERATING IN EGYPT QUIETLY, BUT WE WERE STILL OPERATING THERE. THEY CAME THROUGH THE HOTEL DOOR. THEY CALLED US THE MARRIOTT CELL AND THEY ARRESTED THE THREE GUYS IN THE MARRIOTT CELL, IN THE HOTEL.
Jon: THEY CALLED YOU MARRIOTT CELL, AS THOUGH YOU WERE IN THE MARRIOTT SLEEPER CELL. THESE THREE JOURNALISTS.
YES, THE MARRIOTT HOTEL.
Jon: YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO STAY AT THE DAYS INN.
YEAH, WELL NOW WE KNOW.
Jon: THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
NOW WE KNOW. SO THEY'VE BEEN IN PRISON EVER SINCE. THIS IS 205 DAYS TODAY.
Jon: AND LET ME GET THESE GUYS' NAMES. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. PETER GRESTE...
PETER GRESTE, THE AUSTRALIAN GUY.
Jon: YES.
YEAH.
Jon: BAHER MOHAMED...
BAHER MOHAMED IS EGYPTIAN AND MOHAMED FAHMY WHO IS OUR BUREAU CHIEF WHO IS HALF CANADIAN, HALF EGYPTIAN. SO...
RIGHT. NOW ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN IS IN THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW?
YEAH, MOHAMED FAHMY HE HAD A DISLOCATED SHOULDER AND IT SUDDENLY SORT OF BECAME BROKEN WHILE HE WAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO PRISON.
Jon: SURE, PEOPLE CAN SLIP AND FALL.
THEY CAN SLIP. YEAH.
Jon: SURE.
AND, THEN HE WAS, THEY WERE PUT IN MAXIMUM SECURITY TERRORIST PRISON CALLED THE SCORPION'S UNIT BECAUSE --.
Jon: WHO'S NAMING THINGS IN EGYPT THESE DAYS, OUR C.I.A.? [LAUGHTER] THE, UH, 200 DAYS. NOW, THERE'S A BIG DEAL MADE THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE APPEALED TO EL-SISI, WHO IS NOW THE PHARAOH THERE. [LAUGHTER] AND, HE SAYS HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE JUDICIARY IS A SEPARATE ENTITY FROM, FROM... IT'S NOT UNDER HIS AUSPICES.
HE WAS VERY MUCH MAKING THE POINT THAT IT'S AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AND WE WERE ALL HOPING THAT WAS THE CASE. WE HAD 12 SESSIONS OF A TRIAL, WHICH I WAS ON TRIAL AS WELL BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRIED IN ABSENTIA. THERE WAS A NUMBER OF US THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WEREN'T IN THE COUNTRY, WE WERE ALSO ACCUSED OF HELPING TERRORISTS, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
Jon: RIGHT. AND THESE GUYS ARE MERELY REPORTING SOME NEGATIVE THINGS JUST OBJECTIVELY THAT THE REGIME WOULD FIND OBJECTIONABLE.
WELL, WERE WE REPORTING NEGATIVE THINGS? BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING IN COURT THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH OUR REPORTING.
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE WAS, THERE WAS A HORSE GALLOPING IN A YARD...
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT THEY PULLED FROM THE HARD DRIVE THAT THEY SHOWED IN COURT. THERE WAS FOOTAGE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT SOME OF OUR JOURNALISTS HAD DONE, BUT NOTHING TO DO WITH EGYPT.
Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OF THE TRIAL WAS WHEN THE PROSECUTOR SAID, I HAVE MORE HARD EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE TERRORISTS, BUT I CANNOT SHOW IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT DVD PLAYER. [LAUGHTER]
I MEAN, THAT WAS THE, THAT WAS THE REAL TENET OF THE WHOLE CASE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. WE WERE EXPECTING THE PROSECUTION TO COME UP WITH SOME AMAZING EVIDENCE THAT WE WERE ALL QUITE CONFUSED ABOUT...
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED. BUT EVEN STILL, WE WERE FOUND GUILTY, AND I'VE BEEN SENTENCED FOR TEN YEARS IN JAIL IN ABSENTIA.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE GUYS IN PRISON HAVE GOT BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN YEARS IN JAIL. THEY'RE GOING TO APPEAL, BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT PUT THEM THERE.
Jon: SO, WHAT IS UNDERLYING THIS? BECAUSE SOMETHING, SOMETHING IS GOING ON. SO, WHAT IS IT THAT'S UNDERLYING THEIR IMPRISONMENT? IT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IT IS. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
THERE'S NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN QATAR, WHICH IS WHERE AL JAZEERA IS BASED, AND EGYPT AT THE MOMENT. THERE IS A REAL TUSSLE GOING ON IN THAT WHOLE REGION.
NOW THERE WAS, THOUGH, WHEN MORSI WAS IN POWER...
YEAH.
Jon: THEY WERE ALLIED WITH QATAR.
INDEED. AND THERE'S NO SECRET THAT QATAR DID FUND THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND THAT THE PRESIDENT, WHEN HE WAS ELECTED, I MEAN, AFTER THE REVOLUTION IN 2011, PRESIDENT MORSI WAS THE GUY THEY PUT IN POWER. THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE SAID, WE WANT THIS GUY.
Jon: RIGHT.
NOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. SO, YEAH, QATAR WAS VERY MUCH BACKING THEM, AND NOW, OF COURSE, THEY'RE OUT, AND THE NEW GUYS ARE IN. QATAR'S OUT.
Jon: THE SAUDIS ARE IN NOW. THE SAUDIS ARE THE ONES NOW FUNDING EL-SISI...
THE SAUDIS ARE BACKING, YEP, YEP...
$24 BILLION. CAN THE SAUDIS THEN PUT SOME PRESSURE? DOES INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, DO INTERNATIONAL NORMS MEAN ANYTHING ANYMORE? BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE FURTHER WE GO INTO THESE CONFLICTS, THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR BEHAVIORS OF GOVERNMENTS.
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS PRAY THAT IT DOES MAKE DIFFERENCE.
Jon: OK, THAT DOESN'T REALLY FILL ME WITH ANY TYPE OF HOPE.
NO, I KNOW.
Jon: TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IN THAT SITUATION, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH GOD YOU'RE PRAYING TO TO GET THEM OUT.
I PRAY TO THEM ALL, JON. I PRAY TO THEM ALL.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. PRAY TO THEM ALL.
NO, NO, I PRAY TO THEM ALL.
Jon: BUT, IS THERE ANYWHERE TO APPEAL? WHO'S GOT SWAY IN THIS?
YOU KNOW WHAT, THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION HAS GOT SWAY BECAUSE THE EGYPTIANS AND THE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIMES. AND YOU KNOW, STRATEGICALLY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AMERICA IS FRIENDS WITH EGYPT.
Jon: SO, YOU THINK WE COULD GET THEM OUT? YOU'RE ADORABLE. [LAUGHTER] NO WAY.
NO?
Jon: WE DON'T HAVE... YOU KNOW, THAT'S BEEN THE ENTIRE THING IS AMERICA ALWAYS BELIEVES WE CAN CONTROL ALL THESE OUTCOMES, BUT I THINK THE GAME HAS SLOWLY SLIPPED A LITTLE BIT. CAN PEOPLE DO ANYTHING? WOULD THAT MATTER?
YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS. WE'VE HAD THIS TWITTER CAMPAIGN, THIS FREE AJ STAFF CAMPAIGN THAT HAS GONE GLOBAL, IT'S TRENDING A LOT.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO, PEOPLE CAN TAKE A SELFIES OF THEMSELVES WITH TAPE OVER THEIR MOUTHS AND HOLD THE SIGN UP...
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW WHAT, HAVE A CONSCIENCE ABOUT WHERE YOU GO ON HOLIDAY. YOU KNOW, SO MANY TIMES WHEN I'M IN EGYPT...
Jon: VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLARS. I SEE.
YEAH, YOUR TOURISM DOLLARS. I HEAR AMERICAN ACCENTS WHEN I'M OUT IN EGYPT. MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO GO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS AT THE MOMENT.
Jon: RIGHT. WHEN YOU SEE AMERICAN ACCENTS DO YOU ALSO SEE BERMUDA SHORTS AND VERY LARGE FLOWERY SHIRTS BY ANY CHANCE?
USUALLY, YES.
Jon: THAT BE US. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. I TRULY HOPE THAT THESE THREE JOURNALISTS, THAT SANITY PREVAILS, THAT THESE GUYS WILL BE RELEASED BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. KEEP UP THE GOOD FIGHT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
Jon: SUE TURTON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
