Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT VERY FUNNY  ACTOR AND COMEDIAN. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED MERRY [BLEEP] CHRISTMAS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, DENIS LEARY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU  Jon: YOUNG MAN  THANK YOU  Jon: WELCOME  THANK YOU  Jon: WELCOME TO THE SHOW THANK YOU  Jon: TIME SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE  TO TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK.
I KNOW. IT'S SHAPED LIKE A BOOK. AGAIN IT'S MORE OF A COASTER,  JON. IT'S A CHRISTMAS COASTER. SO IT'S ONE IN A SERIES. NEXT YEAR I'LL HAVE HAPPY  GOD-DAMNED HANUKKAH
Jon: SHOULDN'T A BOOK ABOUT  CHRISTMAS HAVE MORE PAGES IN IT  THAN SANTA HAS REIN DEER?
YOU KNOW, JON, IT'S NOT ABOUT  QUANTITY. IT'S ABOUT QUALITY, FOLKS.
Jon: OH, YEAH, ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO IT'S LIKE I WANTED  TO MAKE A FOUR-AND-A-HALF MINUTE  READ FOR PEOPLE.
Jon: LIKE A SONG. IT'S NOT A BOOK. IT'S A SINGLE.
THANK YOU. IN FOUR-AND-A-HALF MINUTES HE  CAN DESTROY YOUR CHILDREN'S  BELIEF IN YOU SANTA CLAUS AND AN ENTIRE HOLIDAY. AND THE PROCEEDS BENEFIT  FIREFIGHTERS, JON, BECAUSE SANTA  IS NOT REAL BUT FIREFIGHTERS  ARE.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOW. DID YOU PULL THAT ONE OUT.
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MONEY FROM  THIS.
Jon: THIS WOULD NOT GET ME  THROUGH ONE BOWL MOVEMENT
I KNOW. Jon: AS OLD AS I AM NOW, DO  YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THESE I  WOULD NEED?
HERE'S THE THING, JON. THE I-PAD VERSION OF THE BOOK,  HE'S TALKING BOWL MOVEMENTS. HE'S 50. WE HAVE TO HELP HIM OUT HERE. THAT HAS ALL THESE EXTRAS. THINGS EXPLODE. THERE'S SPECIAL EFFECTS AND  EVERYTHING. YOU COULD BE IN THE BATHROOM FOR  A GOOD 45 MINUTES WHICH YOU  PROBABLY ARE ANYWAY. I HAVE TO BE HONEST...
Jon: HERE IS MY FAVORITE PART  OF THE BOOK. LET ME GO TO THIS VERY QUICKLY. CAN YOU GET THAT? HE HAS THE COAUTHOR. (LAUGHING) VERY FUNNY. FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY FUNNY
CAN I EXPLAIN WHY I HAVE A  COAUTHOR?
Jon: A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING. IT'S BAITED ON THE SONG MERRY [BLEEP] CHRISTMAS WHICH WAS  CO--WRITTEN BY CHRIS PHILLIPS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY SAD  COMEDY CENTRAL HAD THIS IDEA AND  CAME TO US. YOU KNOW WHAT CHRIS AND I DID  FOR THIS BOOK?
Jon: WAIT. THIS WASN'T EVEN AN IDEA. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THEY CAME TO US AND SAID CAN  YOU TURN THIS SONG INTO A BOOK? WE WERE LIKE SURE. WE WERE LIKE WHAT DO WE HAVE TO  DO? WE WERE LIKE NOTHING. WE'RE LIKE OKAY.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE  EVER HEARD. IT'S LIKE YOU WERE IN A  VEGETATIVE STATE. AND THEN IS THIS OKAY?
(LAUGHING) BUT WE DID  ACTUALLY RECORD SOME SPECIAL  EFFECTS, LIKE I SAID, FOR THE  I-PAD.
Jon: WHEN YOU AND PHILLIPS  DID THE AUDIO STUFF...
IT HELPS FIREFIGHTERS. LISTEN. THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY GOES. LISTEN. I KNOW IT'S BARELY... IT'S NOT A  BOOK. BUT PLEASE BUY THIS COASTER AND  HELP FIREFIGHTERS EVERYWHERE.
Jon: YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF  JUST PUTTING A PLACEMAT THAT  SAYS, "GIVE MONEY TO FIREFIGHTERS."
THAT'S WHAT I SAID. THEY SAID, NO, WE NEED TO  ACTUALLY HAVE A PRODUCT.
Jon: I'M EXCITED  WHY ARE YOU EXCITED? Jon: BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STOP  CHRISTMAS. YOU CAN ONLY HOPE TO CONTAIN IT. I'M JEWISH. MY KIDS, ONCE THEY GOT AHOLD OF  CHRISTMAS, HANUKKAH TO THEM IS  HILARIOUS. YOU HAVE A POTATO PANCAKE AND  LIGHT A CANDLE. IT'S THE MACABEES
IT'S OVER FOR YOU. THEY'RE GOING TO BE TELLING  THEIR FRIENDS SOON THAT THEIR  DAD ISN'T JEWISH.
Jon: THEY'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE  HALF JEWISH AND THEY KNOW IT'S  THE DIGESTIVE SIDE.
DO THEY STILL BELIEVE IN  SANTA CLAUS?
Jon: YES, THEY DO  DON'T TAKE THIS HOME  Jon: YOU REALLY THINK, EVEN  IF THEY WERE LIKE 18 I'D BRING THEM A MERRY [BLEEP] CHRISTMAS  BOOK?
I DON'T KNOW, JON. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO HELP  THE FIREFIGHTERS. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR AN IRISH GUY YOU'VE  PERFECTED THE JEWISH GUILT.
I REALLY HAVE  Jon: I HAVE TO DO THAT. YOUR KIDS ARE ALL...
MY KIDS ARE GROWN UP. Jon: YOUR WIFE HAS RAISED  THEM SO WELL
THEY STILL TALK TO MY WIFE  AND TELL HER EVERYTHING. I'M JUST THIS GUY, YOU KNOW.
Jon: HANGS OUT IN THE HOUSE  IN HIS UNDERWEAR DOING NOTHING. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THAT
I'M JUST EMBARRASSING TO MY  KIDS AT THIS POINT.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU  ARE. YOU'RE NEVER COOL TO YOUR KIDS. YOU'LL FIND THAT OUT SOON. WELL, YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW. YOU TURNED 50 WHEN? A MONTH AGO?
Jon: A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HONESTLY. LET ME JUST ASK YOU, HOW DO YOU  FEEL?
Jon: I DON'T FEEL WELL. YOU DON'T FEEL WELL? Jon: I'VE ALWAYS SAID THIS TO  PEOPLE. I WEAR MAKE-UP AND A SUIT. IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE I'M NOT  OLD. WHEN PEOPLE SEE ME ON THE  STREET, THEY ALWAYS SAY TO ME,  ARE YOU JON STEWART? AND THEY GO, ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M OLDER THAN YOU. I'M 55. I DON'T FEEL 55 UNTIL I LIKE I  COME HERE AND I SEE YOU AND I  GO, HOLY [BLEEP].
Jon: YOU SHOULD BECAUSE THE  INSIDE OF YOUR YOUNG I'M  SURPRISED LORETTA LYNN IS IN THERE SINGING A [BLEEP] SONG  BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER A DUDE PUT  DOWN MORE COAL AND TAR IN HIS LUNGS THAN THIS GUY
EXCEPT FOR SANTA CLAUS  Jon: THERE ARE PEOPLE  UNIONIZING IN HIS LUNGS RIGHT  NOW. MERRY [BLEEP] CHRISTMAS IS ON  THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. IT'S TO HELP FIREFIGHTERS
IT ACTUALLY IS EVEN THOUGH  YOU JEST
Jon: DENIS LEARY,
