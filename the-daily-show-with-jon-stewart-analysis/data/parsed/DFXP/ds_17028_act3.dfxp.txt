(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, 22 TIME EMMY AWARD-WINNING SPORTSCASTER, WITH A NEW BOOK CALLED 100 YARDS OF  GLORY, THE GREATEST MOMENTS IN NFL HISTORY. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BOB COSTAS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. JON.
Jon: WHAT YOU HAVE GOT THERE.
I'M IN THE GREEN ROOM.
Jon: UH-HUH.
RIGHT, AND IN ADDITION TO A BOUFL GOODIES.
Jon: UH-HUH.
SNICKERS AND WHAT NOT, AND THE USUAL THINGS YOU WOULD FIND IN A FRINGE THERE IS AN ENTIRE DISPLAY CASE OF RED BULL.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, THE ONLY SHOT THAT GIVES YOU WINGS. I'M THERE FOR 20 MINUTES. THERE'S NINE LITTLE THINGS OF RED BULL.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
MY QUESTION IS JUST HOW JACKED UP DO I HAVE TO BE TO TALK TO YOU. IF I WAS TO TAKE ALL OF THIS ON MY WAY OUT, I WOULDN'T NEED TO HOP A FLIGHT HOME TO ST. LOUIS.
Jon: LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING, YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY FOR YOU. WE GET PEOPLE IN HERE LIKE JIMMY CARTER-- DESMOND TUTU, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE USED TO BEING TREATED A CERTAIN WAY. SOME PEOPLE HAVE GREEN ROOM REQUESTS. THIS AND A BOTTLE OF ATAROL AND I WILL DO YOUR SHOW.
HI NO TOUCH DEMANDS.
Jon: YES, I'M BEING SERIOUS. HOW ARE YOU.
I'M GOOD. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS SAN DUST KEY INTERVIEW YOU DID. THAT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING I SAW ON TELEVISION. THE QUESTION WAS, AND HIS LAWYER WAS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. HOW DID HIS LAWYER ALLOW HIS CLIENT TO BE ON THE PHONE WITH YOU.
HE ACTUALLY OFFERED HIS CLIENT. I WAS SET TO INTERVIEW JOSEPH AMONDOLA.
Jon: THE LAWYER.
AND LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE WE WERE TO SIT DOWN HE SAID WHAT IF WE WERE  TO GUESS SANDUSKY ON THE PHONE AND I'M THINKING PERHAPS THAT ISN'T THE BEST  IDEA FROM YOUR STANDPOINT, BUT YES, YES, WE'LL DO THAT.
Jon: DE EVER, LIKE AS HE WAS LEAVING DE LEAN IN AND GO OH, BY THE WAY, I'M A  TERRIBLE LAWYER. (LAUGHTER) DID HE SAY ANY OF THAT?
NO, NO, HE DIDN'T.
Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WAS MAYBE THE MOST N THIS DAY AND AGE OF WELL PRACTICED  PUBLIC RELATIONS AND EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW TO MOUNT THEIR DEFENSE AND DRESS UP  AND PRESENT-- THAT WAS THE MOST REVEALING INTERVIEW IN ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS I  THINK HI EVER SEEN.
AND IT WAS-- IT WAS SO STRIPPED OF ALL THE ART FIS OF TELEVISION, YOU KNOW IT  WAS JUST A DISEMBODIED VOICE WHICH MADE IT ALL THE STRANGER, AND NO B ROLL AS  THEY CALL T NO FOOTAGE REALLY OF HIM, AN OCCASIONAL STILL PICTURE BUT MOSTLY IT  WAS ME LOOKING INTO THE CAMERA INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIM AND HIM ANSWERING THESE  QUESTIONS IN HIS OWN WAY.
Jon: YEAH. I MEAN I FELT ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING QUESTIONS, YOU SAID TO HIM, ARE YOU SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO UNDERAGED BOYS AND HE DOES THAT THING THAT PEOPLE DO  WHEN THEY ARE GUILTY, HE GOES.
AM I SEXUALLY ATTRACT, LIKE HE REPEATS THE QUESTION, LIKE DID YOU BREAK THAT.
DID I BREAK THAT VASE WHAT?
Jon: HE REPEATS IT AND THEN HE GIVES SOME WEIRD LIKE WELL, I LIKE THEIR ENERGY AND --
YEAH, HE SAID I ENJOY BEING AROUND YOUNG PEOPLE, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, AND THEN EVENTUALLY HE GOT TO BUT AM I SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO THEM, NO.
Jon: RIGHT, BUT WHEN YOU SAID --
IT TOOK 17 SECONDS BEFORE THE WORD NO CAME OUT.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAID ARE YOU A PEDOPHILE WHAT HE DID SAY.
HE IMMEDIATELY SAID NO.
Jon: I WONDER IF IN HIS DELUDED, POISONED HEAD HE'S LIKE OH, NO, I'M NOT A  PEDOPHILE, LIKE DOES HE-- HE THINKS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A PEDOPHILE  AND BEING ATTRACTED.
OR PERHAPS HE THINKS, AND I'M RELUCTANT TO GET INTO THIS AREA OF SPECULATION.
Jon: THAT'S WHY BY AM DOING IT.
YEAH.
Jon: ARE YOU A RESPONSIBLE JOURNALIST. SO IN THAT CASE.
CONTINUE, JON, BECAUSE I'M FASCINATED.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, HE'S-- I'M TELLING YOU THOUGH, AND NOW THIS OTHER GUY, IN SIR KURX I KNOW THE  EASY THING TO DO IS THEY ARE IDENTICAL SITUATIONSESES, I KNOW THEY ARE NOT. YOU ARE A SYRACUSE GUY, YOU GOT THIS OTHER GUY. I MEAN IS THIS, IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC WITHIN THESE INFRASTRUCTURES. AND I HATE TO FEEL THAT WAY, AND I HATE TO BE PARANOID ABOUT IT BUT WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH?
SO FAR, AND I UNDERLINE SO FAR THERE IS NO EVIDENCE CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT  THERE WAS SOME SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL COVER-UP AT SYRACUSE THE WAY THERE OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN. WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT AT PENN STATE BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS AN  INSTITUTIONAL COVER-UP AT PENN STATE. YOU WONDER WHY THE SYRACUSE POST STANDARD DIDN'T PURSUE IT MORE THAN THEY DID.
Jon: THEY HAD THIS TAPE OF THE ACCUSER AND THE ACCUSED WIFE IN 2002. NOBODY DID ANYTHING WITH IT.
RIGHT. THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T CORROBORATE IT AT THAT POINT. AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE, I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT GOES BUT IT RAISES A  QUESTION, DENNIS DUVAL WHO PLAYED BASKETBALL IN SYRACUSE WHEN I WAS A STUDENT TLRBS, VERY GOOD, PLAYED BRIEFLY IN THE NBA, BAHEM WAS AN ASSISTANT COACH. FOR A LONG TIME DENNIS WAS THE SHERIFF OF ONONDAGA COUNTY AND WHEN THIS WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO THE  AUTHORITIES THERE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IF NIP INFLUENCE DENNIS HAD BUT IT IS A  QUESTION WORTH ASKING. THEY DIDN'T PURSUE IT AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T PURSUE IT AGGRESSIVELY. AND ESPN HAD THE TAPE FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THEY SAT ON THE STORY UNTIL PERHAPS  COINCIDENTALLY JUST AFTER THE PENN STATE THING BROKE.
Jon: THAT'S CRAZY. AND YOU DO WONDER, YOU KNOW, YOU FEEL LIKE, YOU FEEL WHEN YOU FIRST MOVE TO NEW YORK, LIKE I JUST IS A A COCKROACH. AND I KNOW THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THOSE MOTHER [BLEEP] DOWN THERE, AND THAT IS THE THING  THAT YOU WORRY ABOUT. LIKE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMES TO LIRKTS YOU WONDER, LIKE DO WE HAVE TO  NOW IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOCIETY HAS CHANGED AND YOU CAN'T LET YOUR KID PLAY  OUTSIDE ANY MORE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FORGET ABOUT LIKE OHIO STATE PLAYERS GETTING A  TATTOO FOR A JERSEY, LIKE THIS IS REAL.
YEAH. IF ANYTHING GOOD IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THESE TWO SITUATIONS, WHICH ARE NOT  EXACTLY THE SAME, THEY ARE GREATER DISSIMILARITIES AT THE MOMENT THAN SIMILARITIES. BUT IF ANYTHING GOOD IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS, THERE IS GOING TO BE AN AWARENESS OF IF YOU SEE SOMETHING OR IF YOU HAVE  REASON TO SUSPECT SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES CHILDREN BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, IT'S NOT  ENOUGH TO, CERTAINLY NOT TO TURNT OTHER WAY AND CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO SAY  WELL, I PASSED IT ON TO MY IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR. YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH. AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO HAVE PROCEDURES. AND I THINK WILL YOU FIND MORE AND MORE THEY WILL DO BACKGROUND CHECKS THEY ARE  DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON KOCHES, ASSISTANT COACH, ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH THESE KIDS.
Jon: GOOD. NICE JOB. BY THE WAY, 100 YARDS OF GLORY. GET THAT, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY GOOD TOO.
YOU KNOWS WHAT'S REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS, PICTURES, DVD, I DID ONE DAY OF WORK, ALL RIGHT THIS GUY DID TWO YEARS OF WORK, JOE GARNER. JOE GARNER HAS NO CHANCE OF BEING ON THIS SHOW.
Jon: NO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF I AM BEING-- WE'LL PROBABLY EDIT HIS NAME OUT. BUT THIS IS TO HIS ADVANTAGE BECAUSE WILL GET LOTS OF MONEY IF YOU BUY THIS BOOK.
Jon: GOOD. 100 YARDS OF GLORY.
