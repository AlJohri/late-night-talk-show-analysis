Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. YOU KNOW WE COVER A LOT OF BAD NEWS. BUT LET'S LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD ABOUT AMERICA.  FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MINNESOTA.
COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS WERE ON THE GROUND IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS CANVASSING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS, THE WOMAN YOU SEE HERE IN THE PURPLE HOODIE SWEATSHIRT IS MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR BETSY HODGES. SHE'S POSING FOR A PHOTO WITH ANOTHER VOLUNTEER NAMED NAVELL GORDON.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT IS AWESOME, IT'S GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY AT ITS FINEST. OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
THIS IS A PHOTO OF MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR BETSY HODGES ARM IN ARM WITH A MAN FLASHING WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TELL US A KNOWN GANG SIDE FOR A NORTH SIDE GANG. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S A GANG SIGN. ALL THIS TIME I'VE BEEN THE LEAD IN FOR A NOTORIOUS GANG MEMBER. (LAUGHTER) TERRIBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S IT! I DON'T WANT THAT GANG MEMBER, I WANT THAT GUY GONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, KTSP EYE WITNESS NEWS 5 HAS TAKEN THIS STORY VERY SERIOUSLY.
TONIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES ALERTED US TO A PHOTO THAT HAS THEM FUMING OVER THE ACTIONS OF MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR BETSY HODGES.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY THE MAYOR WOULD TAKE A PICTURE WITH A CONVICTED CRIMINAL WHILE HE AND THE MAYOR FLASH GANG SIGNS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS. IT'S TO WARN CLOWN ASS BITCHES, NOT TO SNITCH. (LAUGHTER) I ASSUME. IT'S JUST NOT A SENTENCE I SAY A LOT. HOW ON EARTH CAN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE EXPLAIN THIS BLATANT ENDORSEMENT OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?
A SPOKESPERSON CONCLUDES BY SAYING QUOTE SHE AND THE MAN IN THE PHOTO ARE JUST POINTING AT ONE ANOTHER TO WHICH THE HEAD OF THE POLICE UNION SAYS SHE'S BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH, SHE KNOWS BETTER.
Jon: COME ON! SHE HAS HELD ELECTIVE OFFICE SINCE 2005. WHEREAS POINTING AS A GESTURE ONLY GOES BACK TO LITERALLY THE VERY FIRST FORM OF HUMAN COMMUNICATION. BY THE WAY, THAT OF COURSE-- NO, DO NOT ENCOURAGE NOTORIOUS GANG KINGPIN HUGGIE D. ALRIGHT, SO MAYOR BETSY HODGES WAS DOING VOTER REGISTRATION WORK WITH A MAN WHO WASN'T IN A GANG AND WAS BRAZENLY FLASHING A NOT-GANG SIGN. SO HOW DID THIS GET PAINTED AS A GANG THING?
ONE MONTH AGO SHE TOOK A STRONG POSITION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS. SHE WROTE THIS IN AN OPEN LETTER TO THE COMMUNITY.
QUOTE SOME OFFICERS ABUSE THE TRUST THAT IS AFFORDED TO THEM. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR ROLES TO DO HARM RATHER THAN PREVENT IT.
OH, I GET WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. THIS ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THE MAYOR FLASHING THIS SIGN AT A SUPPOSED GANG MEMBER, AS IT IS ABOUT THE POLICE UNION FLASHING THIS SIGN AT THE MAYOR. ANYWAY, THE COPS ARE MAD. BECAUSE THE MAYOR CRITICIZED THEIR CONDUCT. SO WHEN THEY CAME ACROSS THIS PICTURE THEY TOLD EVERYONE THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THIS PICTURE. WHICH MEANS UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S TIME TO ONCE AGAIN UPDATE OUR LIST OF INNOCENT THINGS BLACK PEOPLE DO THAT LOOK SUSPICIOUS. (LAUGHTER) HOLD ON, HOLD ON. HERE WE GO. DON'T WEAR A HOODIE, DON'T CARRY SKITTLES. DON'T CARRY KEYS, DON'T REACH FOR A WALLET. DON'T DRIVE IN A CAR IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD. DON'T DRIVE IN A CAR. DON'T BE A PASSENGER IN A CAR. DON'T KNOCK ON A WHITE PERSON'S DOOR. AND NOW DON'T POINT. WHICH OF COURSE FOR GOD'S SAKES MEAN BLACK PEOPLE, WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAY FROM SPORTING EVENTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
