FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK.  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [THEME MUSIC PLAYS]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. PBS ANCHOR HARI SREENIVASEN IS JOINING US. FIRST OFF, I WANT TO THANK THE AUDIENCE FOR COMING OUT TONIGHT ON WHAT IS TRULY A GOD FORSAKEN EVENING WITH THIS GLOBAL WARMING HOAX-PROVING WEATHER. TODAY, JUST HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, BUT IT'S VERY NICE OF THEM TO COME OUT.  BUT FIRST, EVERY NATION HAS ITS ISSUES WITH LEADERS WHO FAIL TO LIVE UP TO THE ETHICS AND INTEGRITY OF THEIR OFFICE. WHETHER IT'S CORRUPTION, INCOMPETENCE OR AN INSATIABLE DESIRE TO SMOKE CRACK. TO BE FAIR THOUGHT, THAT WAS BEFORE MAYOR ROB FORD OF TORONTO SOUGHT HELP. HE'S BEEN SOBER FOR FOUR WEEKS NOW AS THIS VIDEO OF HIM FROM TWO NIGHTS AGO IN TORONTO WILL ATTEST.
[SPEAKING INCOHERENTLY]
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY INTERESTING, CANADA HAS TWO OFFICIAL LANGUAGES  AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS NEITHER OF THEM. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE BACK HERE IN THE STATES IT'S OUR GOVERNORS CURRENTLY SUCKING THE GLASS [BLEEP] METAPHORICALLY.
NEW ACCUSATIONS AGAINST CHRIS CHRISTIE AND HIS ADMINISTRATION THIS MORNING. FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOB McDONNELL AND HIS WIFE FACE FOURTEEN CRIMINAL CHARGES THIS MORNING.
Jon: OOH BOTH SOUND JUICY. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO, YOU KNOW, THE ALLEGEDLY BULLYING GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE I GREW UP. OR THE ALLEGEDLY CORRUPT GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE I WENT TO COLLEGE. SO LAST TIME CHRISTIE'S TEAM CHILDISHLY BLOCKED TRAFFIC. WHAT'D THEY DO  THIS TIME, MAILBOX M80'S, WHAT HAPPENED?
HOBOKEN MAYOR DAWN ZIMMER HAS GONE PUBLIC WITH ALLEGATIONS THAT CHRISTIE'S LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, KIM GUADAGNO, DELIVERED WHAT SHE CALLED A  THREAT ON THE GOVERNOR'S BEHALF TO WITHHOLD MUCH-NEEDED SANDY RELIEF FUNDS FOR HER FLOOD-DAMAGED CITY IF SHE DID NOT SUPPORT A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP] THAT IS SOME OLD SCHOOL NEW  JERSEY CORRUPTION. HEY NICE CITY, BE A SHAME IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO IT. [LAUGHTER] OH, SOMETHING DID. IT'S ALREADY UNDERWATER. STILL THOUGH,  DO WHAT WE SAY. WHAT'S VIRGINIA GOT GOING?
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY GOVERNOR McDONNELL AND HIS WIFE MAUREEN ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED THOUSANDS IN MONEY AND GIFTS FROM A VIRGINIA BUSINESSMAN JOHNNY WILLIAMS EAGER FOR STATE HELP IN PROMOTING HIS COMPANY'S LINE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AH, THE OLD GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE GET YOU TO PAY THEM TO PROMOTE YOUR DIETARY SUPPLEMENT GRIFT. WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. IT EXPLAINS THE STATE'S NEW MOTTO, VIRGINIA IS FOR 10,000 MILLIGRAMS OF NIACIN. WHEN WE SAY MONEY AND GIFTS WHAT'RE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF FREE FLIGHTS ON THE CEO'S PLANE.
THAT $15,000 CATERED CHICKEN DINNER AT THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. ANOTHER $10,000 FOR THE WEDDING OF THE GOVERNOR'S OTHER  DAUGHTER.
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE OTHER DAUGHTER? [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE GOING TO THROW DOWN $15,000 FOR SOME BEAUTIFULLY BRAISED CHICKEN MARSALA FOR DAUGHTER #1, AND THEN DAUGHTER #2 COMES AROUND "YOU KNOW I'M ALSO GETTING MARRIED," AND HE'S LIKE YOU GET A COBB SALAD AND JUICE BOXES FILLED WITH PICKLE BRINE. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET. [LAUGHTER] THAT ACTUALLY MAKES YOU THIRSTIER. WE NEVER LIKED YOU CHARLENE. ANY WAY, WHAT ELSE DID THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE GET?
A THREE-DAY VACATION AT A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR LAKEHOUSE AND A $190,000 WHITE FERRARI FOR THE GOVERNOR TO DRIVE WHILE THERE.
Jon: SURE WHEN YOU ARE A PUBLIC SERVANT ON A PAID FOR VACATION AT A DONOR'S LAKEHOUSE YOU GOTTA KEEP A LOW PROFILE.  SO IT'S ALL PRETTY STANDARD POLITICIAN LIVING HIGH ON THE HOG OFF A PATRON LARGESSE. IT'S BRIBING MATERIAL.
TWO SETS OF GOLF CLUBS, TWO iPHONES, AND 30 BOXES OF AN EXPENSIVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHOA! NOW YOU ARE TALKING MY LANGUAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] 30 BOXES OF TOP SHELF ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES. BLACK LABEL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES. HOW DOES THAT BACK ROOM DEAL GO DOWN? YOU WANT MY HELP WITH YOUR PRODUCT. WELL I'M GONNA WRITE A NUMBER DOWN THAT'S GOING TO GET THIS DONE. IT'S THE NUMBER TO MY PHARMACIST. YOU CAN -- [LAUGHTER] -- CALL IN A PRESCRIPTION AND GET THE COATED STUFF. THE OTHER STUFF GIVES ME THE --- YOU KNOW. HE KNOWS THE DOSAGE! THERE'S NO WAY THE NEW JERSEY STORY'S GOT THE KIND OF FUN  DETAILS. THE NEW JERSEY STORY CANNOT HAVE THE FUN DETAILS OF PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH GRAFT. UNLESS EX-MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR HALEY BARBOUR WANTS TO WEIGH IN ON THE VERACITY OF THE HOBOKEN MAYOR'S CLAIMS.
THE NEWS MEDIA IS WILLING TO LEAP AT ANY FARFETCHED STORY WITH THE BASIS IN FACT UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS A LADY  MAYOR WHOA WHOA, LADY MAYOR? I BELIEVE THEY PREFER TO BE CALLED MAYORMOISELLES, MAYOR-ETTES OR MAYOR. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MAYOR OF HOBOKEN HAS  BEEN ACCUSED. MAYOR, WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE OF THE THREAT?
I WROTE IN MY JOURNAL AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WAS TOTALLY-- I MEAN I WAS SO UPSET.
Jon: YOU WROTE IT IN YOUR JOURNAL. FIRST OF ALL, AS WE HEARD EARLIER YOU ARE NOT A MAN, MAYOR, YOU DON'T HAVE A JOURNAL. YOU ARE A LADY MAYOR, YOU HAVE A DIARY. [LAUGHTER] BUT -- BUT. CONTINUE.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT SHE WAS SAYING TO ME. I TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING WITH GOVERNOR CHRISTIE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE AND IT ENDS WITH ME TALKING ABOUT MY HUSBAND AND HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW DIARIES HAD A B STORY. I BELIEVE THIS HAS RISEN TO THE LEVEL OF MUST BE BROUGHT TO LIFE ON OUR SHOW. JESS? ♪
DEAR DIARY, I MET WITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TODAY SHE THREATENED TO WITHHOLD THE MONEY TO REBUILD HOBOKEN. IT REMINDED ME OF JUST HOW MUCH I WANT TO GO HOME AND GET HOBONKIN' WITH MY HUSBAND. WHO I LOVE VERY MUCH AS YOU KNOW FROM PREVIOUS ENTRIES. THANK YOU. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: SO MAYOR ZIMMER'S DIARY OUTLINES THAT CHRISTIE'S LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR KIM GUADAGNO THREATENED HER. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RESPONSE?
I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MAYOR OF HOBOKEN. THE MAYOR ONCE TOLD ME THERE WAS AN EMPTY HOLE AND SHE ASKED ME HELP HER FIND A COMPANY TO FILL IT. AND WE DID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU KNOW IN NEW JERSEY THAT COULD MEAN SO MANY THINGS. MAYBE ONE OF THEM GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT LADY MAYOR ZIMMER  THOUGHT OF THAT EXCHANGE.
DEAR DIARY, TODAY I FEEL POSITIVELY HO-BROKEN. THANK GOD FOR YOU DIARY MY TRUSTY OUTLET FOR RECORDING THINGS I'LL LATER NEED TO PRESENT AS HARD EVIDENCE. SPEAKING OF WHICH IT'S DATE NIGHT. WINK, WINK A-OOGA, HUBBA, HUBBA MOMMY LIKEY, [PANTS LIKE DOG] THANK YOU. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: BACK TO VIRGINIA. WHY WOULD POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER BOB McDONNELL AND HIS WIFE MAUREEN RISK EVERYTHING FOR A SPORTS CAR AND SOME ADMITTEDLY HIGH END ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATION.
LET ME READ ONE OF THE E-MAILS FROM MRS. McDONNELL TO ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S SENIOR ADVISORS. [READING TEXT] [READING TEXT]
Jon: OOH [bleep]. SO THEY HAD THEIR OWN MONEY PROBLEMS. WELL WE ALL KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO SIT THE McDONNELLS  DOWN AND GIVE THEM SOME  STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU CAN'T SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME, YOU GO BROKE,
SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL AT A LOT OF LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.
WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS.
AND UNTIL WE MANAGE THE GOVERNMENT'S MONEY LIKE PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR OWN MONEY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MRS. McDONNELL'S MIND AROUND THAT TIME. PERHAPS JESSICA WILLIAMS CAN ENLIGHTEN US WITH THIS. ♪
DEAR DIARY, VITAMIN BOY BETTER COME THROUGH WITH THAT DRESS OR I WILL (bleep) SHOVE THOSE HORSE PILLS SO FAR UP HIS ASS HE WILL WISH HE NEVER PAID FOR MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING OR OTHER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. AND THOSE PLANE TRIPS AND INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AND MUCH NEEDED ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, JESSICA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
