(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK. NOW THE CONSENSUS ON THE  PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE LAST  NIGHT SEEMS TO BE LIGHT A  MATCH. WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN ONE  THING, IT'S TIME ONCE AGAIN  TO-- THIS MAY BE THE LEAST  SHINY TURN EVER MADE. SOMEONE ON A STRICT DIET OF  CEMENT AND TALC IT WAS  PRETTY DULL. FIRST STRATEGY, READ  DEFINITION N THE LAYMAN  PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOKED  LETHARGIC AND OUT OF IT BUT  ACCORD TOGETHER TURD-- IT WASN'T LETHARGY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HANDLED  HIMSELF WITH THAT DIGNIFIED  RESERVE THAT WE HAVE ALL  SEEN AS PART OF WHO PRESIDENT OBAMA IS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS  HAD A CERTAIN DIGNIFIED  RESERVE AND I THINK THAT'S  ONE OF THE ADMIRABLE QUALITIES ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT.
Jon: YES T WAS DIG NEED  RESERVE.
A LADY DOESN'T DEBATE. THE GUY IS FIGHTING TO SAVE  HIS JOB, SAVE DIGNIFIED  RESERVE FOR-- HOW ABOUT  GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE. MAYBE OBAMA WAS LETHARGIC  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER  GUY.
I THINK ROMNEY MIGHT HAVE  HAD A THEATRICAL AGGRESSION. I THINK FOR FOLK AS HOME IT  CAME ACROSS A LITTLE TESTY.
Jon: I THINK YOU  MISHEARD. I THINK 9 FOLKS AT HOME ARE  SAYING IT LOOKS LIKE JUST  ONE GUY UP THERE HAS TESTES. ALL RIGHT. TIME FOR THE FINE GRIT SAND  PAPER OF TURD POLICY. THIS IS NOT THE TURD YOU  WERE LOOKING FOR.
YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S  PERFORMANCE HERE TONIGHT. HE WASN'T SPEAK TOGETHER  PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. HE WASN'T SPEAKING TO THE  PUNDIT CLASS. HE IS SPEAKING TO PEOPLE AT  HOME.
HIS TARGET WAS THAT  UNDECIDED VOTER, TUNING IN,  IN THE SUBURBS OF DENVER,  SITTING DOWN ON THE COUCH WITH THEIR FAMILY, TO THE  CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND I THINK HE REALLY  REACHED THOSE VOTERS.
Jon: YES, THE UNDECIDED  FIRST TIME SITTING ON A  COUCH IN DENVER VOTER. HE REACHED THAT VOTER, THAT  TOTALLY EXISTS. THEY TELL SO YOU THEMSELVES  BUT LIKE JANUARY BRADDY'S  MYSTERIOUS BOYFRIEND GEORGE  GLASS, THEY ARE IN CANADA RIGHT NOW. PRETTY LACKLUSTER POLICY  GUY, GET CREATIVE. TRY JUST GOING ROSS PEROT ON  THAT [BLEEP].
ROMNEY'S PROBLEM IS THAT  THIS DEBATE IS IN 2012, NOT  1812.
HE GAVE A GREAT TESTIMONY  BUT WEEK INDICTED FOR  PERJURY. MITT ROMNEY ARE COMMITTED  HIMSELF TO THINGS THAT THE  RIGHT AND RENOT GOING LIVE  UP TO. A FISH WOULD NOT GET CAUGHT  IF THEY KEPT THEIR MOUTH  SHUT.
Jon: HERE'S --
HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM, I CAN  TELL YOU RIGHT UP STRAIGHT,  HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT  DID THAT WAS WRONG F A FROG HAD A HELICOPTER HE WOULDN'T  NEED A BICYCLE, HE IS? -- SEE? HEAR ME OUT. MITT ROMNEY IS A BUG IN A  CONNER LIKE A CHICKEN IN A  SMOOTHIE FACTORY, DOESN'T  MAKE SENSE. SI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS  TALKING ABOUT BUT AT LEAST  FOR A FEW SECONDS, I WAS  HAPPY. I GUESS WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS  YOU CAN ALSO PLAY THE WILD  CARD.
OBAMA ARRIVED IN DENVER  AT 2 P.M. TODAY, JUST A FEW  HOURS BEFORE THE DEBATE  STARTED. WHEN YOU GO TO 5,000 FEET.
EXACTLY.
nd YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW  HOURS TO ADJUST-- .
Jon: THE AT 250UD-- ALTITUDE? YES F ONLY BARACK OBAMA HAD  BEEN TO DENVER BEFORE HE  WOULD KNOW THE MILE HIGH  CITY WOULD BE HIS WATER LOOP, HE HAS NEVER PERFORMED THAT  WELL THAT FAR ABOVE SEA  LEVEL, OH WAIT.
AMERICA, HE CANNOT TURN  BACK. NOT WITH SO MUCH WORK TO BE  DONE. NOT WITH SO MANY CHILDREN TO  EDUCATE, AND SO MANY  VETERANS TO CARE FOR, AND  GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
