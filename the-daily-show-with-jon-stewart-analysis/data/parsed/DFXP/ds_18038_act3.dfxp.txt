(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MY GUEST TONIGHT A FINE  ACTRESS STARS IN THE  TWILIGHT MOVIES, HER NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "ON THE ROAD"   ♪  ♪ ♪.
Jon: DAMN HIPPIES. PLEASE WELCOME KRISTIN  STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW ARE YOU? PLACE PLAUS NICE TO SEE YOU,  THANKS FOR COMING ON THE  SHOW.
THIS IS COOL. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SITTING  HERE.
Stephen: IT'S REAL LUCITE,  BABY. LET ME ASK YOU, SO I WOULD  THINK THE HARDEST THING TO  DO IN ACTING IS DANCE, LIKE JUST BE UNINHIBITIED. I DON'T THINK-- I CAN BARELY  DO IT AT PARTIES WHEN I'M  HAMMERED.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS ME MOST  OF THE TIME. I'M DEFINITELY --
A WALL FLOWER.
ABSOLUTELY.
Stephen: SO HOW DO  THEY-- WHAT DO THEY DO TO  GET YOU GUYS TO BE  UNINHIBITIED OR TO LET  LOOSE? DO THEY HAVE TO-- IS THAT  TWO HOURS INTO IT, HOW DO  THEY DO IT?
YOU'RE DOING ON THE ROAD,  DON'T MESS IT UP.
DID YOU FEEL THAT  PRESSURE.
YEAH, I THINK THAT WAS  THE MAIN THING THAT SORT OF  KICK STARTED EVERYTHING FOR US, IS WE SORT OF FELT LIKE  WE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR IT  YEAH, I WAS PRETTY SCARED OF THAT SCENE. BECAUSE MY MOM-- HOMES ARE  FEW AND FAR BETWEEN WHERE I  REALLY GET TO EXHIBIT, YOU KNOW, LIKE PURE SORT OF WILD  NATURE, EXUBERANCE.
Stephen: AND ARE YOU SUCH  A MUSE IN THE FILM THAT IT  IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT CATALYST ELEMENT.
YES, IT IS. SHE DEFINITELY NEEDED TO  REPRESENT WHAT THE IT OF ON  THE ROAD IS.
Stephen: RIGHT.
AND WORDILESSLY SORT OF  NEEDED TO.
Stephen: HAVE YOU HEARD  FROM THE BEAT GENERATIONMENT  I WOULD THINK YOUR GENERATION WOULDN'T  NECESSARILY BE AS INVESTED  IN IT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE  EVEN I, IT WAS BEFORE MY  TIME. WE ALL READ IT IN HIGH  SCHOOL, "CATCHER IN THE RYE"  AND ON THE ROAD AND ALL  THAT.
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
Stephen: OH, WHAT, ARE  YOU KIDDING ME? I GOT MANY A SCENE, YEAH, I  Z ALL THOSE. WHEN DID YOU START ACTING.
I WAS LIKE 9 OR 10.
Stephen: AND WAS THAT  PRETTY FULL-TIME LIKE DID  YOU GO TO REGULAR SCHOOL, DID YOU GO TO LIKE MORE OF A  I GUESS ON THE SET TYPE  THING.
I STAYED IN PUBLIC SCHOOL  UNTIL I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL  AND THEN I SORT OF, I NEEDED TO KEEP MY GRADES UP. AND THAT DIDN'T WORK IN  PUBLIC SCHOOL.
Stephen: WHEN THEY ARE  DOING THAT ON THE SET, DO  YOU HAVE TO RUN THROUGH ALL THAT LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID  WE HAD TO LIKE READ, YOU  KNOW, ON THE ROAD AND THEN  DELIVERANCE BUT THEY WOON EVEN DO THAT NOW IN  SDOORBLTION IS TOO  CONTROVERSIAL I WOULD GUESS. BUT HOW DO THEY, WHAT DO  THEY DO? JUST HAVE A GUY IN A TRAILER  LIKE READ THIS AND THAT IS  THE EXTENT OF IT.
LET ME SEE AT THAT POINT  I SAW ON THE ROAD ON A  READING LIST AS A FRESHMAN THAT IS HOW I READ IT FOR  THE FIRST TIME. PROBABLY SAYS SOMETHING  ABOUT THE SCHOOLS, I THINK  IT IS USUALLY A LITTLE OLDER OR POSSIBLY NOT AT ALL.
Stephen: RIGHT.
NOWADAYS THAT WOULD BE  ONE OF THOSE BANNED BOOKS  THAT LIKE IT'S ALMOST LIKE IN FOOT LOOSE NOW, YOU CAN'T  HAVE THIS KID DANTZING.
RIGHT.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, I  DON'T WANT HIM READING ABOUT  DRIVING AND DANCING.
ALL THAT DRIVING.
Stephen: AND THAT SORT OF  THING.
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. I WENT TO --
MORE PROGRESSIVE.
YES.
Stephen: WELL, THAT'S  NICE.
I KIND OF GOT TO DESIGN  MY CURRICULUM SOME. WHAT IT WAS COOL? IN HIGH SCHOOL.
YEAH.
Stephen: THIS HAS TO BE  CALIFORNIA.
IT WAS INDEPENDENT STUDY. I WAS AN ACTOR, YOU KNOW.
Stephen: WAS IT OTHER  ACKER, WAS IT LIKE OTHER  ACTOR KIDS OR JUST A REGULAR  CALIFORNIA.
I THINK I COULD HAVE GONE  TO A PROM. I WAS INVITED TO A PROM. I WAS LIKE WHO IS GOING TO  SHOW UP TO A PROM. THE SCHOOL BARELY EXISTS IN  A LITERAL --
THERE WAS A PROM AT THAT  SCHOOL.
YEAH.
Stephen: SO IT WAS REALLY  A KID ASKED YOU TO HIS  HOUSE.
YEAH.
Stephen: COME TO MY  BASEMENT! IT'S PROM THAT'S GREAT. YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THIS  FILM THOUGH, EVEN BEFORE YOU,  YOU KNOW, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, HIT, THE BEFORE THE BIG  TWILIGHT MOVIES AND ALL  THAT. WHAT DREW YOU TO IT BEFORE  ANY OF THIS OTHER MATERIAL?
I WOULD HAVE DONE  ANYTHING ON THIS FILM. I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED IN A  CARAVAN OR CATED FOR  EVERYONE, DONE PROP SERVICE.
WAS IT THE NOVELL THAT  SPOKE TO YOU, WAS IT  SOMETHING THAT JUST HIT YOU THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU FELT  LIKE MAN, I JUST WANT TO BE  INVOLVED IN THAT.
YEAH, IT WAS MY FIRST  FAVORITE BOOK IT WAS THE  FIRST TIME, I ALWAYS DID OKAY IN SCHOOL BUT IT WAS  THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD, I  MEAN, YOU KNOW, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT SORT OF, I REALLY  CAME ALIVE. I OPENED A LOT OF DOORS.
YOU FELT PASSIONATE.
YES, DEFINITELY, YES,  DEFINITELY KICK STARTED  SOMETHING IN ME.
Stephen: PASSION ENOUGH  TO CATER.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S  RIGHT. BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK THAT  I COULD PLAY THAT PART AT  ALL.
Stephen: I CAN TELL YOU  ABOUT THE SAD TRUTH ABOUT MY  ACTING CAREER. I ACTUALLY HAVE CATERED.
THAT'S SWEET.
Jon: THAT IS THE EXTENT  OF MY ACTING CAREER.
NICE.
Jon: IT WAS A TERRIFIC  PERFORMANCE AND THEY GET A  LOT OUT OF EVERYBODY IN THAT  THING. YOU FEEL THAT PERIOD AND YOU  FEEL THE MOMENT. AND FOR A MOVE THAEL THEY  SAY IS UNFILMABLE YOU DID A  HELL OF A JOB.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
Stephen: ON THE ROAD,  OPENS IN SELECT CITIES  DECEMBER 2 1st. KRISTIN STEWART. (APPL
