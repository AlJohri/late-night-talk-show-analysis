FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ALAN GREENSPAN. ALAN GREENSPAN JOINING US. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT SHUTDOWN FALLOUT. THE REPUBLICAN SHUT DOWN TACTICS AND POLITICS WAS OFFENSIVE TO EVEN INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATES THAT THIS COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE IT'S POISED TO TURN BLUER THAN A SMURF'S BALLS AFTER DRY HUMPING A BOTTLE OF WINDEX. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A PICTURE FOR THAT. [LAUGHTER] ALL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO TO GAIN LIKE AN 80% TO 20% ADVANTAGE IN THIS COUNTRY, ALL THAT STANDS IN THEIR WAY, IS A MILDLY COMPETENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTH CARE POLICY THEY BATTLED SO HARD TO KEEP. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
THE WORD GLITCH HAS BEEN USED BY THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS PROMISING. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S HEAR MORE.
HEALTHCARE.GOV IS PLAGUED BY GLITCHES.
RIDDLED WITH GLITCHES.
GLITCHES.
SNAFU.
BUGS, KINKS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THIS.
Jon: GLITCHES. YES APPARENTLY THE HEALTH CARE.GOV WEBSITE HAS 99 PROBLEMS BUT A GLITCH IS ALL OF THEM. [LAUGHTER] LET'S INTRODUCE THE NEW SEGMENT SPINNING BEACH BALL OF HEALTH CARE. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? PAGE FREEZES?
MANY ARE HAVING TROUBLE JUST GETTING ON TO THE WEB SITE, LOGGING ON.
Jon: OKAY SO THE FIRST STEP DOESN'T WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I HAVE A FEELING AFTER THAT IT'S -- [LAUGHTER]
WRONG INFORMATION ON MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY AND LONG DELAYS IN TIMEOUTS.
Jon: THAT'S NOT SO BAD IT'S ALSO A FEATURE OF NFL GAMES IN AMERICA. AMERICA LOVES THOSE.
CONFUSING ERROR MESSAGES, BROKEN CALCULATORS.
Jon: THE (bleep)  CALCULATOR DOESN'T WORK? THE ONE THING INCLUDED IN COMPUTERS SINCE 1972, YOU COULDN'T MAKE THAT WORK? WHAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT CALCULATOR DOES IS SPELL OUT THE WORD BOOBS NO MATTER WHAT YOU PLUG INTO IT? HOW DOES IT NOT WORK? GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT, HOW BAD IS IT?
ACCORDING TO A POLL BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FEWER THAN ONE IN TEN PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO SIGN UP WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS. THAT'S A SUCCESS RATE OF LESS THAN 10 %.
Jon: HOW BAD IS THAT? 20% IS THE NUMBER OF DENTISTS WHO RECOMMEND SUGARED GUM. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW LOW IS IT? ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL MORE OF THIS COUNTRY BELIEVES OBAMACARE HAS BEEN REPEALED THAN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WHOLE POINT OF WEB SITES IS TO DESIGN THEM SO THAT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO NOT SIGN UP FOR SOMETHING. FOREVERY TIME I GO ON AMAZON THERE'S A 40% CHANCE I'LL MISTAKENLY OVERNIGHT MYSELF I6 SEASONS OF NIGHT COURT. IT'SF JUST THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS PAGE? YES, OOPS TURNS OUT I ORDERED SOMETHING. SO HOW ARE THEERED DEMOCRATS GOING TO SPIN THIS TURD?
I THINK THE NUMBER ONE POINT ABOUT THE ROLLOUT IS THERE'S HUGE INTEREST. 19 MILLION INDIVIDUAL VISITS TO THE WEB SITE IT'S HUGE.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S HUGE, YOU'VE ANGERED A LOT OF PEOPLE.
THE NUMBER ONE WORRY BEFORE WE STARTED WAS ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BE INTERESTED? WILL PEOPLE SIGN UP? AND THE  ANSWER TO THAT IS OVERWHELMINGLY YES.
Jon: YEAH, BUT THEIR NUMBER ONE WORRY WAS WILL I BE ABLE TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE OUT OF THIS THING AND THE ANSWER APPEARS TO BE 90%. AT LEAST FOR THE 10 PERCENTERS ABLE TO LOG ON AND ENROLL LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.
THERE'S FLAWED DATA EVERYTHING FROM DUPLICATE ENROLLMENTS, TO MISSING DATA FIELDS TO PROBLEMS WITH ELIGIBILITY AND SPOUSES REPORTED AS CHILDREN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT KIND OF COMPUTER PROGRAM FORCES YOU TO  MARRY YOUR OWN CHILDREN? HOW DARE YOU? [LAUGHTER] TURNS OUT THE OBAMACARE ROLLOUT WAS PLAGUED BY A LOT MORE THAN JUST GLITCHES. SO MUCH SO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO AS YOU KNOW, DOES NOT USUALLY MAN THIS COUNTRY'S IT SUPPORT CENTER SUMMONED US ALL THIS MORNING TO THE ROSE GARDEN FOR A LITTLE GLENGARY GLENN ROSS CLOSER SCHPIEL. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT JUST A WEBSITE.
THE HEALTH INSURANCE IS WORKING JUST FINE. WOINSTEAD OF PAYING $1600 PER MONTH, WE HAVE A PLAN THAT WILL ONLY COST US $692 A MONTH. COTHE PRODUCT IS GOOD. I WANT PEOPLE TO GET THE GREAT PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT IS WORKING. IT'S REALLY GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHEN DID THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TURN INTO GILL FROM THE SIMPSONS?
SHE'S A BEAUT. YOU CAN'T BEAT A COLECO. HOW MANY CAN I PUT YOU DOWN FOR? A LOT. PLEASE SAY A LOT, I NEED THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT. ALL RIGHT. BUT LISTEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE DIDN'T STOP BABY. RON POPEIL KEPT ON SELLING.
YOU JUST HEARD JANICE'S STORY. SHE OWNS HER OWN SMALL BUSINESS. SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO ENROLL IN COVERAGE THROUGH DELAWARE'S EXCHANGE.
Jon: SO THAT'S ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY YOU CAN'T USE THE WEB SITE, HAVE YOU TOLD THEM ABOUT JANICE FROM DELAWARE? HEY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GOD BLESS. SHE SIGNED UP. SHE DESERVES TO BE UP THERE TO PROVE IT COULD BE DONE EASILY.
IT TOOK HER SEVEN HOURS ON THE PHONE AND ON LINE. SHE HAD TO GO AND CLEAN OUT THE COOKIES AND THEN SHE WAS ABLE TO SIGN UP BUT SHE SIGNED UP FROM THE SMALL STATE OF DELAWARE.
Jon: SHE HAD TO MOVE. SHE HAD TO MOVE AND SHE'S NO LONGER MARRIED BUT IT IS DONE. SHE'S DONE. SHE HAD TO MOVE OH, SHE HAD TO DO A GIANT TATTOO OF A SPIDER. [ LAUGHTER ] ON HER NECK BUT IT'S DONE. SHE HAS IT ITS DONE. AS IT TURNS OUT EVEN THE PHOTO OP TO ADDRESS THE POORLY PLANNED ROLLOUT OF OBAMACARE SUFFERED FROM A CLEAR LACK OF PLANNING AS EVIDENCED BY THE DECISION TO PLACE THE PREGNANT WOMAN WITH DIABETES IN THE SUN NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] GOOD SAVE. [LAUGHTER] GIVE THE WOMAN SOME WATER! BUT FEAR NOT, HELP IS ON THE WAY.
WE'VE HAD SOME OF THE BEST IT TALENT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY JOIN THE TEAM AND WE'RE WELL INTO A TECH SURGE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
A SURGE.
Jon: YOUR WEB SITE IS SO (bleep), WE HAVE TO USE THE SAME STRATEGY WE USED TO SALVAGE THE IRAQ WAR. WELL OUR OWN JOHN OLIVER HAS BEEN TRYING TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE. HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW. JOHN.
HI, JON! IS THAT YOU? THANK GOD. PLEASE DON'T LEAVE, DON'T LEAVE, JON, PLEASE.
Jon: ARE WHERE ARE YOU?
HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED. I WENT TO HEALTHCARE.GOV LIKE YOU ASKED. I GAVE THEM ALL MY INFORMATION. I PRESSED ENTER. THERE WAS A GIANT SUCKING SOUND. NEXT THING I KNEW I WAS INSIDE THE WEB SITE, JON. I'M STUCK IN HERE. IT'S  AWFUL. IT'S HORRIBLE IN HERE.
Jon: THERE ARE STILL A FEW GLITCHES?
GLITCHES! LOOK AT ME, JON. I DIDN'T GET A 404 FILE UNFOUND SCREEN I GOT SUCKED IN THE MAINFRAME. GLITCHES.
Jon: IS THAT CODE BEHIND YOU? ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE ZEROS AND ONES?
IT'S FOURS AND FIVES HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHICH SUBCONTRACTOR [BLEEP] THAT UP. THAT'S ELEMENTAL CODING.
Jon: DO YOU AT LEAST HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE NOW?
I DON'T. I'M STILL BEING PROCESSED BUT LIKE THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE PRODUCT IS GOOD, JON. IT'S JUST THAT THERE IS A SMALL RISK THAT APPLICANTS MIGHT GET SUCKED INTO A TRON-LIKE  CYBER BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE WITH NO ESCAPE.
Jon: HAVE YOU TRIED HITTING ESCAPE.
THANK YOU SANJAY, THAT WAS THE FIRST THING I TRIED. THE FIRST THING. MY HOPE IS THAT THEY'LL BEGIN TO FIX IN SOME WAY. NO, JON, I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
Jon: IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
HOW OLD IS THIS SOFTWARE, JON?
Jon: WOW! THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. WELL, THE WEB SITE IS VERY BUSY SO I CAN'T GET YOU HELP RIGHT NOW.
QUICKLY HE'S COMING BACK!
Jon: YOU HATE TO SEE THAT. JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
