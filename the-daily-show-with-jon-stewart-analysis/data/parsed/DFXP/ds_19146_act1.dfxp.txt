FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MY GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERY EXCITED. MY GUEST TONIGHT, RAMITA NAVAI. SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF "CITY OF LIES." I DON'T WANT THE GIVE ANYTHING AWAY, IT TURNS OUT EVERYBODY IS LYING. YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. BUT, FIRST WE TURN TO WASHINGTON, D.C., HOME OF OUR NATION'S MOST RESPECTED INSTITUTIONS AND ALSO THE GOVERNMENT.
AMERICANS HAVE A VERY LOW OPINION OF CONGRESS, AND THIS NEXT STORY PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO HELP THAT VERY MUCH.
Jon: OH, CHRIST. WHAT DID CONGRESS DO THIS TIME? WHAT DID THEY KILL A VETERANS' BILL TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT FOOD STAMPS OR OUTLAW TAN BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WORE THE COLOR? OR, WHAT DID THEY KICK A PUPPY IN AN ELEVATOR? WHAT DID THEY DO?
NEW YORK'S JUNIOR SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND SAYS SHE'S BEEN THE TARGET OF SOME VERY INAPPROPRIATE SEXIST COMMENTS RIGHT IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS.
Jon: NOT JUST SEXIST COMMENTS, INAPPROPRIATE SEXIST COMMENTS. THAT'S MY LEAST FAVORITE KIND OF SEXIST COMMENT. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? THE SENATE IS AN AUGUST BODY, IT IS THE SAUCER THAT COOLS THE HOT TEA OF OUR DEMOCRACY. CONGRESS IT'S ITS UPPER HOUSE. SURELY SEXISM, EVEN THE INAPPROPRIATE KIND, IS BENEATH THEM.
SHE SAYS AN OLDER MALE COLLEAGUE TOLD HER THAT, "GOOD THING YOU'RE WORKING OUT BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GET PORKY." [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: BY PORK I ASSUME THE GENTLEMAN WAS REFERRING TO APPROPRIATIONS TARGETED TO HER LOCAL CONSTITUENTS.
ONE OF HER FELLOW SENATE MEMBERS APPROACHED HER, SQUEEZED HER STOMACH AND SAID, "DON'T LOSE TOO MUCH WEIGHT, NOW. I LIKE MY GIRLS CHUBBY."
Jon: DON'T GET TOO PORKY. I LIKE MY GIRLS CHUBBY. EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO [BLEEPED] SEXISM, THE SENATE IS GRIDLOCKED. THEY CAN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THEY CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE. LUCKILY THERE'S ALWAYS ONE ASSHOLE LEFT. TO BREAK THE TIE.
THE PRIZE COMMENT, SHE WRITES, CAME FROM A SOUTHERN CONGRESSMAN, WHO SAID, AS HE HELD MY ARM, "YOU KNOW, KIRSTEN, YOU'RE EVEN PRETTY WHEN YOU'RE FAT."
Jon: OH, YEAH, YES, THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF AROUSAL YIELDS THE REMAINDER OF HIS BONER TO THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM NEW YORK. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THESE COMMENTS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN ANY CONTEXT, BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN IRONY TO BEING JUDGED ON ONE'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE BY A GROUP OF MEN WHO, IF YOU SQUINT, LOOK ON A GOOD DAY LIKE A BOWL OF DRIED FRUIT. APPLE CHIPS. IT'S MOSTLY APPLE CHIPS. I GUESS I'M JUST SAYING, HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE: IF C-SPAN 2 WERE TO AIR CLOSE-UPS FROM THE HIT SHOW "PUPPETRY OF THE PENIS," VIEWERS MIGHT CALL IN AND SAY, "HEY, YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING GOOD." CAUSE THEY LOOK WORSE THAN SOMEONE'S BALLS IS WHAT I'M SAYING. I'M SAYING THAT SOME SENATORS, IF YOU SQUINT AND LOOK CLOSELY, AND THERE'S A CLOSE-UP, THEY LOOK LIKE SOMEONE'S BALLS. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. I AM SAYING THAT. I'M NOT GOING TO NAME NAMES, BUT OUR SENATE IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE BALLS. [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUSLY THE MALE SENATORS IN THIS STORY DID SOMETHING DESPICABLE, BUT ISN'T THERE A WAY KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND COULD ALSO BE IN THE WRONG?
WHY WOULDN'T KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND NAME NAMES?
DOESN'T SHE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO NAME NAMES? I THINK SHE SHOULD.
IF YOU'VE GOT THE GUTS TO WRITE ABOUT IT, HAVE THE GUTS TO NAME THE NAMES.
Jon: YES, YOU KNOW WHAT, THE GROWN-UP VERSION OF THE RICH KID FROM EVERY '80s MOVIE HAS A POINT. WHY WOULDN'T, WHY WOULDN'T THE WOMAN MAKING THE LARGER POINT ABOUT THE GENERAL CULTURE OF WASHINGTON NOT TURN THIS INTO A NARROW PERSONAL ATTACK ON THE PEOPLE SHE SEES AT WORK EVERY DAY. MAYBE THIS SENATOR GILLIBRAND JUST HAPPENED TO RUN ACROSS A COUPLE JERKS. PROBABLY MOST WOMAN WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED TO HEAR ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS.
IT'S NOT SURPRISING. IT REALLY ISN'T.
IT DOESN'T COME AS A SURPRISE.
I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.
I GOT SOME COMMENTS THAT WOULD JUST MAYBE BLOW YOU AWAY.
WE ALL HAD OUR STORIES OF WHOM YOU WOULD NOT GET ON AN ELEVATOR WITH. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: RIGHT. WE ALL HAVE OUR STORIES ABOUT WHICH PERSON ELECTED BY VOTERS IN THEIR STATE TO A SIX-YEAR TERM, VESTED WITH THE POWERS TO ADVISE, CONSENT, AND DECLARE WAR, YOU WOULD NOT TRUST IN THE THREE TO FIVE SECONDS IT TAKES TO GO FROM TWO TO L. BUT DON'T WORRY, GUYS, JUST BECAUSE SENATOR BUZZKILL CAN'T HANDLE A FRIENDLY ABDOMINAL GROPING, AT LEAST SOME WOMEN STILL APPRECIATE THE FINE ART OF THE CAT CALL.
MEN ARE GOING TO BE THAT WAY. WHAT CAN YOU DO? THEY MEAN IT IN A NICE WAY, I THINK.
IT USED TO BOTHER ME. OH, THIS IS SO SEXIST. NOW I'M LIKE, IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, I'M LIKE EXCUSE ME.
WHY NOT?
JUST AS LONG AS YOU DON'T COME WITHIN ARM'S-LENGTH, IT'S GOOD.
BUT THEN, IF YOU CAN'T GET INTO A CAB OR YOU'RE STUCK THERE, THEN IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL. OR IF I HAVE MY LITTLE BOY THERE THEN YOU'RE LIKE, HE'S KIND OF USED TO IT AT THIS POINT. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: EH, EVERYBODY WANTS TO [BLEEPED] MY MOM. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, TAKE THE PAR. IS THERE NO WAY FOR A THOUGHTFUL GENTLEMAN TO APPROPRIATELY CONVEY HIS APPRECIATION OF A WOMAN OF THE FEMININE GENDER.
IF THE MOMENT STRIKES ME, THIS IS MY MOVE. I'M GOING TO SAY, VERY SLOW, JUST LIKE THIS. [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW, YOU WALK BY, AND JUST THE CLAPPING, AND I WOULD SAY THE SUCCESS RATE IS ABOUT 90% YOU GET A SMILE.
Jon: CAUSE IT'S CLASSY. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M OUT THERE YELLING, "YO, BABY, I'M A MOTORBOAT, LET'S MAKE THE LONG ISLAND SOUND, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PRESUMPTUOUS." FOR MORE WE GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS LIVE TONIGHT OUTSIDE THE SENATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHAT IS YOUR... YOU'RE A WOMAN. JESSICA. WHAT IS YOUR... WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON ALL OF THIS? YOU'RE CLAPPING, I GET IT, THAT GUY WAS CLAPPING, SO NOW YOU'RE CLAPPING.
OH, NO, JON, YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST HOW WE WOMEN SHOW OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE MALE GAZE, AND IF YOU MAY OFFER MY OWN UNSOLICITED COMMENTS TO THAT GUY, THOUGH SMILES DO NOT INDICATE A 90% SUCCESS RATE.
Jon: THEY DON'T? BUT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO THE SMILES MEAN?
YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, IT MEANS THAT THE WOMAN IS TRYING HER BEST TO END THIS INTERACTION, BECAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T SMILE, HE MIGHT TELL HER TO SMILE. IF SHE TELLS YOU TO LEAVE HER ALONE, YOU'LL PROBABLY CALL HER A BITCH. AND I KNOW HE THINKS HE'S DIFFERENT, THAT HE'S CLASSY, HE'S CHARMING, BUT SINCE GOING TO WORK ISN'T A PERFORMANCE, WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR APPLAUSE, AND WHAT HE'S DOING IS BASICALLY JUST A HIGH-MINDED LINCOLN CENTER VERSION OF HEY, SWEET TITS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I SEE YOU SEEM TO HAVE STRUCK A NERVE WITH OUR AUDIENCE.
MMM.
Jon: WELL, ON BEHALF OF MY GENDER, I, I AM, I AM SO SORRY.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD A LOT WORSE. ONE TIME THIS GUY WITH A HAIRLESS CAT STANDING ON THE STREET...
Jon: NO, NO, NO...
TOLD ME I HAD A...
Jon: DON'T FINISH THIS, DON'T FINISH THIS BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE THAT'S GOING.
OK, DEAL. DEAL, DEAL. THAT'S FINE, BUT MY POINT IS, THIS TELLY SAVALAS-LOOKING MOTHER [BLEEPED], AND YEAH THAT'S RIGHT, I KNOW WHO TELLY SAVALAS IS. HE'S KOJAK, RIGHT? CAUSE MY GRANDMA, MY GRANDMA USED TO WATCH IT AND SHE WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT IT. I GUESS HE WAS LIKE A SEXY GUY, LIKE AN NYPD OFFICER. HE HAD A TOOTHPICK.
Jon: HE WAS VERY SEXY. THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WAS BALD.
Jon: YES.
OKAY. WHATEVER. ANYWAY, THAT TELLY SAVALAS-LOOKING MOTHER [BLEEPED] SHOULD HOLD HIS APPLAUSE BECAUSE OUR WALK TO WORK IS NOT THERE FOR HIM TO COMMENT ON. IT'S NOT A RED CARPET. IT'S NOT A FASHION WEEK RUNWAY. IT'S A SIDEWALK. AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, GETTING THE HORNY CLAP OF APPROVAL FROM ANY GUY DOES NOT IMPROVE MY DAY. IT ACTUALLY CREEPS ME OUT. SO GUYS, GET SOME IMPULSE CONTROL. CAUSE I'VE GOT SOME [BLEEPED] TO DO.
Jon: ALRIGHT. JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
