[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, LET ME EXPLAIN THIS VERY QUICKLY. IRAQ IS NOT OUR ONLY PAL IN THE MIDDLE EAST THERE. WE GOT OUR OLD FRIEND THERE EGYPT. YEAH. HOW THEY DOING THESE DAYS?
THREE JOURNALISTS FROM AL-JAZEERA HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO SEVEN YEARS IN AN EGYPTIAN PRISON.
FOUND GUILTY ON CHARGES INCLUDING HELPING A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION BY PUBLISHING LIES.
Jon: YES. THANK YOU, GENERAL EL-SISI. I'M SORRY, PRESIDENT EL-SISI, FINALLY BRINGING THE HAMMER DOWN ON TERROR JOURNALISTS. [LAUGHTER] I'M SURE THEY RECEIVED A FAIR TRIAL IN THE GENERAL'S COURT. [PEOPLE'S COURT THEME MUSIC PLAYING] NOTHING SAYS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY LIKE KEEPING THE DEFENDANTS IN CAGE AND HAVING THE JUDGE WEAR SUNGLASSES SO YOU CAN'T SEE HIS EYES. JUSTICE ISN'T BLIND, BUT IT HAS MACULAR DEGENERATION IN ITS FAMILY. NEEDS TO PROTECT ITS EYES. I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY. BUT, LET'S GET TO THE TRIAL ITSELF. BECAUSE ALL THREE OF THESE MEN, BAHER MOHAMED, MOHAMED FAHMY, A CANADIAN EGYPTIAN, AND PETER GRESTE, AN AUSTRALIAN, ARE RESPECTED INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS, SO PROSECUTORS MUST HAVE BROUGHT A CASE TIGHTER THAN KING AKHENATEN'S SARCOPHAGUS. [LAUGHTER] "WHOSE SARCOPHAGUS IS FAMOUS FOR ITS TIGHTNESS." SO WHAT IS THE TERROR EVIDENCE? OR TERROR-VIDENCE?
THE ONLY EVIDENCE, IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT, THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS PRESENTED HAS BEEN OLD VIDEO CLIPS, VIDEO CLIPS OF NEWS CONFERENCES, NEWS REPORTS, SOMETIMES NEWS REPORTS FROM OUTSIDE OF EGYPT.
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THE EVIDENCE THEY PRESENTED WAS. ONE OF THEM WAS FOOTAGE OF A TROTTING HORSE THAT WAS AIRED BY SKY NEWS ARABIA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WAS IT ANY HORSE OR WAS IT LEGENDARY HORSE TERRORIST ABU MISTER ED? WHO I BELIEVE TESTIFIED.
THEY AGITATED IN MY NEIGH-BORHOOD. THEY'RE GUILTY. LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA.
I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IT WAS OF COURSE OF COURSE. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THIS TRIAL WAS A SHAM. A SHAM SO SHAM-Y EGYPT'S PROSECUTION COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EVEN PRETEND IT WASN'T A SHAM. THEIR CASE IS BASED ON SOME RANDOM VIDEO CLIP THEY PROBABLY FOUND ON THE WEB. "WE GOT TO JAIL THESE TERRORISTS AND HERE'S A HORSE AND A DOG IN A BALLERINA SUIT. WE'LL THROW IN A BABY DANCING. AND THE PROSECUTION RESTS." COME ON EGYPT, YOUR EVIDENCE HAS TO BE MORE COMPELLING THAN THIS.
THE PROSECUTION CLAIMED THEY HAD MORE VIDEO EVIDENCE, BUT THEY ALSO CLAIMED THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROPER EQUIPMENT TO SHOW IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE HAVE MORE EVIDENCE, BUT IT'S ON BLU-RAY. NOW WE COULD WAIT FOR THE GUY TO SHOW UP WITH THE HDMI CABLE, OR I COULD JUST PUT YOU IN [BLEEPED] JAIL FOR SEVEN YEARS. YOU DON'T HAVE A GENIUS BAR, GEEK SQUAD, SHEIK SQUAD? THAT WOULD WORK. THAT'S THE THING. EVEN MORE THAN THE CORRUPTION OF THIS TRIAL, WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THE LAZINESS. AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO FORGE SOME EVIDENCE. IT'S NOT THAT HARD. LOOK. OH, MY GOD. IT'S THE REPORTS HAVE AN UNDERWATER TERRORIST CONFERENCE WITH BIN LADEN AND DR. DOOM. THAT WOULD BE MORE CONVINCING THAN THE EVIDENCE THE EGYPTIAN COURT JUST CONVICTED THESE MEN ON. AND, BY THE WAY, DON'T THINK WHEN THE PEOPLE FINALLY RISE UP AGAINST EL-SISI, THEY WON'T FOLLOW THE SAME STRICT RULES OF EVIDENCE.
HE'S A DICTATOR. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU NEED A HORSE TELL YOU THIS. [NEIGHING]
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
