[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF BLACKWATER. HIS BOOK IS CALLED CIVILIAN WARRIORS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ERIK PRINCE. SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO THE SHOW. THE BOOK IS CALLED CIVILIAN WARRIORS. YOU, SIR, HAVE A BIT OF A REPUTATION AND I WOULDN'T SAY DESERVED OR NOT BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO VIEW YOU AS A LESS THAN SAVORY CHARACTER, SATANIC  ILLUMINATI. I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION THERE. I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.
THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.
Jon: WHY DID YOU WRITE THIS BOOK?
TO SET RECORD STRAIGHT. WE'VE BEEN MISCHARACTERIZED AND BEAT UP IN THE MEDIA AND BLOGO SPHERE FOR LONG ENOUGH.
Jon: WHAT IS THE GREATEST MISCHARACTERIZATION OF YOU.
IS THAT WE WERE OUT OF CONTROL MERCENARIES. WE WERE VERY MUCH UNDER CONTROL. WE WERE UNDER CONTROL THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE STATE DEPARTMENT DOD CUSTOMERS. I WAS A VETERAN. I HIRED VETERANS WE WENT AND DID A JOB THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED US TO DO. THEY ANSWERED THE CALL AGAIN. IT WAS AN ALL VOLUNTEER FORCE.
Jon: BUT YOU ARE MERCENARIES.
OXFORD, THE DICTIONARY WOULD DEFINE THAT DIFFERENTLY.
Jon: OH, NO YOU DIDN'T. OH, NO YOU DIDN'T. WAIT, WHAT?
THE DICTIONARY WOULD DEFINE IT AS GOING TO FIGHT IN A FOREIGN WAR NOT YOUR OWN. WE WERE AMERICANS WORKING FOR AMERICA DEFENDING AMERICANS IN AN AMERICAN ACTION OVERSEAS.
Jon: I DO AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK IT'S AN EASY TARGET BLACKWATER. YOUR NAME IS BLACK WATER FOR GOD'S SAKES.
NOT EVEN SOME SMART MARKETING FIRM CAME UP WITH THAT. WHEN WE WERE BUILDING THE PLACE IT WAS A TRAINING FACILITY WE BUILT IT TO TRAIN SEALS.
Jon: WHEN HE SAYS SEALS HE MEANS NAVY SEALS.
RIGHT.
Jon: PEOPLE MIGHT THINK IT'S AN ODD CHANGE OF DIRECTION. OUR LEGS STARTED TURNING BLACK FROM THE PEAT.
THE LOGO OF A BEAR PAW CAME FROM PUTTING FIVE MILES OF POWER POLES AND THE BEARS WERE RIPPING THE CLAWS INTO THE POLES MARKING THEIR TURF. IT WAS DEVELOPED ON THE BACK OF A NAPKIN.
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING. THERE WERE SOME INCIDENTS IN IRAQ THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WERE, IF NOT OUT OF CONTROL, AS CLOSE TO OUT OF CONTROL. THE NISSAR SQUARE IS THE FAMOUS ONE WHERE 17 CIVILIANS WERE KILLED IN WHAT THE INQUEST DETERMINED WAS UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE.
CERTAINLY ANY TIME A CAR BOMB GOES OFF THE SITUATION SOUGHT OF CONTROL. WE DID MORE THAN 100,000 MISSIONS WHERE NO ONE WAS KILLED OR INJURED. ANY TIME AN INNOCENT LIFE IS LOST IT'S TRAGIC. 41 OF OUR GUYS DIED PROTECTING THE US GOVERNMENT. THE SQUARE STARTED WITH A CAR BOMB AND A TEAM MOVED TO HELP THAT TEAM LEAVE THE AREA. AND AFTER THEY GO THROUGH THE USE OF FORCE CONTINUUM, THEY ENDED UP HAVING TO FIRE. A FIRE FIGHT ERUPTED. THE ARMORED VEHICLE THEY WERE IN WAS DISABLED BY INCOMING ENEMY ROUND WHICH DELAYED THEM LONGER BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS DISABLED. YEAH, IT'S A TRAGEDY.
Jon: MAYBE THIS BRINGS UP THE POINT INHERENT IN THE DIFFICULTY OF BEING IN YOUR POSITION AND THAT IS THAT THE GOALS OF BLACKWATER WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AS THE GOALS OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. YOU ARE TWO SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS. AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN HIRED. YOU SAID SOMETHING INTERESTING, I THOUGHT, WHICH WAS OUR JOB WAS TO PROTECT THESE GUYS.
PROTECT THE DIPLOMATS.
Jon: PROTECT THE DIPLOMATS. THAT'S A VERY NARROW DEFINITION OF THE JOB IN IRAQ. IRAQ HAD A WHOLE WINNING OF HEARTS AND MINDS  COMPONENT. OUR TROOPS WERE HELD TO A DIFFICULT RULE OF ENGAGEMENT, YOU KNOW THE ANBAR UPRISING AND TRYING TO QUELL THE INSURGENCIES BY WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES. BLACKWATER TO THEIR CREDIT, LIKE YOU SAY PEOPLE DIDN'T DIE, BUT DIDN'T YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT DIRECTIVE AND GOAL THAN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND DOESN'T THAT POINT OUT THE INHERENT DIFFICULTIES OF LARGE BORE, LARGE SCALE HIRED FORCE?
I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE DYSFUNCTION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE DOD, DEPARTMENT OF STATE C.I.A. WORKING TOGETHER. WE WANTED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE MEETINGS TO DO THE RECONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS, TO DO POLITICAL RECONCILIATION WHICH WE DID. OPERATING UNDER THEIR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. PART OF THE FRUSTRATION FOR US. IF THERE WAS A MISSION WE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED IF WE WORKED FOR AN NGO WE WOULD USE A VERY LOW PROFILE VEHICLE. IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A BEAT UP TAXI. IN CASE THEY ARE WORKING FOR A STATE DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE TO GET A POLISHED VEHICLE, DRIVING BETWEEN THE SAME POINTS EVERY DAY MAKES IT EASY FOR THE ENEMY TO HIT YOU.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THEN THAT IT IS -- GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU SAY THERE'S CONFUSION FOR ALL THESE GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER, BUT YOU SAID YOU WERE UNDER THE SAME RULES OF ENGAGEMENT BUT NOT BOUND BY IT. NOT IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE WOULD BIND SOMEBODY BY IT. THOSE GROUPS ARE NOT BOUND BY THAT ARE THEY?
WE HAD RULES OF ENGAGEMENT DICTATED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WE DIDN'T HAVE OFFENSIVE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE WE WERE NOT THERE TO PLAY OFFENSE. OUR GUYS WERE UNDER THE MILITARY CODE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE STATE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T WANT US UNDER THAT RULE. WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED IT --
Jon: DOESN'T THAT CREATE THOUGH BY NOT KNOWING HAVING THE SAME CHAIN OF COMMAND, DOESN'T THAT CREATE SO MUCH DIFFICULTIES WITHIN THAT THEATER OF OPERATION IS THAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT WOULD IT BE BETTER FOR THE MONEY TO BE PUT TOWARDS INCREASING THE ACTUAL MILITARY FORCE?
WHEN YOU, YOU KNOW THE U.S. MILITARY ROLLED FROM KUWAIT TO IRAQ AND WHEN YOU STOP IT AND TURN NIGHT A COUNTER INSURGENCY FORCE IT'S A DIFFERENT MIX. IT CREATES GAPS. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE THERE TO FILL. YOU COULD RAMP UP THE CAPABILITY, USE IT FOR A FEW YEARS AND WHEN WE DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE IT GOES AWAY. YOU DON'T HAVE LEGACY INSURANCE, RETIREMENTS ALL THE REST.
Jon: THE CBO SAYS IT'S THE SAME. THEY SAY THE SAME.
THE GAO I SAW SHOWED US BEING FAR CHEAPER.
Jon: I'M GOING WITH CBO.
OKAY.
Jon: YOU WANT TO ARM WRESTLE FOR IT.
SURE.
Jon: WAIT, I JUST MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT. CIVILIAN WARRIORS IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. YOU SHOULD READ THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS FORCE IS AND WHAT IT MEANS TO THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE VIEW OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EXPERIENCED IT AND DEALT WITH IT. ERIK PRINCE, GET THE BOOK.
