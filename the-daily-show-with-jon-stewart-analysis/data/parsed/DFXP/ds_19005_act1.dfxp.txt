FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OH, YEAH. WORKING ON A FINE PROGRAM TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE SECRETARY OF OBAMACARE AND HUMAN OBAMACARES KATHLEEN OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE DISCUSSION OVER OBAMACARE AND ITS EFFECTS IS COMPLETELY APROPOS AS WE CHECK IN ON DAY SEVEN OF OUR SADLY ONGOING COVERAGE OF. â™ª  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHILE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON LAST WEEK'S TOTALLY NECESSARY NONASSININE BOTH PARTIES ARE EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THE GALAXY DESTROYING DARK FORCE KNOWN AS OBAMACARE WAS UNLEASHED ON AN UNSUSPECTING AND YET STILL TRUSTING WORLD. HOW DID IT GO? [SCREAMING] JUST AS I THOUGHT! [LAUGHTER] OBAMACARE HAS EXPLODED THE CHEST CAVITIES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY IF YOU PUT LITTLE CUTE EARS ON THAT THAT COULD BE A FRENCH BULLDOG. [LAUGHTER] HOW DID THE OPENING OF OBAMACARE HEALTH EXCHANGES REALLY GO?
WEB SITES WERE SLOW OR CRASHED ALTOGETHER.
THE MAIN PAGE WENT FROM APPLY NOW TO THIS PLEASE WAIT.
STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH DROP-DOWN MENUS AND THINGS TIMING OUT.
I TRIED TO GET ON HEALTHCARE.GOV. THIS SITE HAS BEEN DOWN PARTIALLY ALL WEEKEND. P
NBC TRIED ENROLLING BUT THE SYSTEM WASN'T BUDGING BUT SHE CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE.
THIS IS 15 MINUTES NOW. I ALMOST SPENT 20 MINUTES ON THE PHONE NOW.
Jon: NAILED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHOOHOO. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT ABOUT THIS COUNTRY:  WE WILL CAMP OUT ALL NIGHT TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO BUY A PHONE OR SEE A MOVIE ABOUT SHIRTLESS WEREWOLVES BUT YOU HAVE 10 MINUTES TO GET ME THIS (bleep) HEALTH CARE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY WE MUST HAVE BEEN -- LET'S BE FAIR, THEY MUST HAVE LEBEEN INCREDIBLY OVERWHELMED BECAUSE WE KNOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS THE MOST TECH SAVVY ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY. STOP SENDING ME E-MAILS. [LAUGHTER] AND KNOWING THAT, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD THREE YEARS TO SET UP THE WEB ENROLLMENT FOR THE PRESIDENT'S CENTERPIECE LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENT. YOU KNOW OBAMA MUST HAVE HAD THE TECH END BUTTONED UP. THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF LINCOLN DIDN'T BOTHER PROOFING THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION AND ENDED UP FREEING THE DAVES, SURE GOOD NEWS FOR ANY SLAVE NAMED DAVE. THE OBAMACARE IMPLEMENTATION ROLLOUT HAS LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED. WHAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO OFFER A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE.
THE REPUBLICANS HINTED THE ONLY WAY TO END THE SHUTDOWN IS TO TIE IT TO THE DEBT CEILING FIGHT.
WE'RE NOW LUMPING IN THE DEBT CEILING AND THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND THE FIGHT OVER  OBAMACARE.
Jon: RIGHT I FORGOT THEY ARE (bleep) NUTS. THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND BLATANT INCOMPETENCE STILL PALES IN COMPARISON TO THESE GUYS, TO THESE AN ASTEROID WILL COLLIDE WITH THE EARTH AND REPUBLICANS ARE REFUSING TO SEND BRUCE WILLIS UNTIL OBAMACARE IS DEFUNDED. DNOW IT SEEMS IN ORDER TO STOP OBAMACARE THE REPUBLICANS ARE THREATENING TO REFUSE TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING WHICH WOULD THETECHNICALLY PUT THE UNITED STATES IN DEFAULT, TECHNICALLY. NOT REALLY, RIGHT GUYS? LIKE TECHNICALLY YOU MIGHT HAVE HERPES BUT IF IT'S DORMANT -- WHAT?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFAULT ON THE DEBT. IF THAT HAPPENS THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO PAY FOR THAT.
WE BRING IN $250 BILLION IN TAXES EVERY MONTH. OUR INTEREST PAYMENT IS $20 BILLION. TELL ME WHY WE WOULD EVER DEFAULT.
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A DEBT CEILING IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN NOT INCREASED. IN MY HOUSEHOLD SOME BILLS HAVE IN TO BE PAID AND SOME WE CANVE DEFER. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO PAY EVERY BILL THE DAY IT COMES IN.
Jon: WHAT A GREAT STRATEGY. THAT WAS MY STRATEGY, IN COLLEGE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN I SMOKED A LOT OF POT AND WORKED AT A CINNABON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN RETROSPECT PROBABLY NOT A [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN RETROSPECT PROBABLY NOT A GREAT IDEA TO BE HIGH ALL THE TIME AT A CINNABON. [LAUGHTER] STILL REPUBLICANS MADE A CONVINCING CASE. MAYBE BLOWING THROUGH THE DEBT CEILING NO BIG DEAL.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SCARING PEOPLE.
THEY WANT TO THREATEN A DEFAULT TO SCARE PEOPLE.
I THINK THAT ALL THIS TALK ABOUT A DEFAULT HAS BEEN A LOT OF DEMAGOGUERY.
Jon: OH, SO THEY ARE TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE. YOU GUYS WOULD NEVER DO THAT? WHAT WAS YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT OBAMACARE AGAIN?
IT'S A DISASTER, I THINK IT'S A TRAIN WRECK. I THINK IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
OBAMACARE HAS BEEN A JOB KILLER.
IT WILL BANKRUPT THE COUNTRY.
WE'LL NEVER RECOVER FROM OBAMACARE IF IMPLEMENTED.
IT COULD EASILY PUSH US INTO A RECESSION.
OBAMACARE IS A DESTROYER AND IT'S GOING TO DESTROY OUR FREEDOM.
Jon: JUST SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD FACT-BASED AHHHHH! UNLIKE OBAMACARE REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY FOR THE RIGHT REASONS. FOR MORE ANALYSIS ON THIS NATION'S ONLY TWO APPARENT OPTIONS WE'RE JOINED BY SAMANTHA BEE REPRESENTING TEAM INCOMPETENCE AND JASON JONES FOR TEAM NIHILISM. HOW ARE YOU? SAM, JASON, HI.
HI.
Jon: VERY NICE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S -- LET'S START WITH SAM THEN.
THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY HERE. IF IT COULD GAIN THE PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE THROUGH BETTER EXECUTION OF THIS PROGRAM THEY WOULD BE IN A TREMENDOUS POSITION. THAT'S A GREAT POINT, JON. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS WORKING ON GETTING THINGS RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I'M REMINDED OF A STORY OF A 39-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO CAME UP TO ME.
Jon: SAM, YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE WRONG CAMERA.
OH, MY GOD. SO SORRY. OH, GOD. OH, CAMERA UP HERE HURTS MY EYES.
Jon: LET'S START WITH JASON. JASON.
YES, YES AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TRUST WITH OUR HEALTH CARE.
Jon: IT'S A FAIR POINT THERE. YOUR SIDE'S SOLUTION WOULD BE?
EASY (bleep) IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IS THERE A STEP TWO TO THAT PLAN?
OF COURSE THERE'S A STEP TWO. IT'S A TWO-STEP PLAN. STEP ONE (bleep), STEP TWO IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JON, THIS COUNTRY IS OUT OF CONTROL WITH UNIONS, WORK SAFETY, HANDOUTS. WE'VE GOT TO BURN IT TO THE GROUND. WE NEED TO RETURN THIS COUNTRY TO THE TYPE OF UNFETTERED FREE MARKET CONDITIONS THAT, YOU KNOW MADE ALL THAT OTHER LIBERAL (bleep) NECESSARY.
Jon: HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THIS SAM? SAM HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THIS?
SORRY I'M EXPERIENCING AN UNUSUALLY HEAVY VOLUME OF QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.
Jon: I ONLY ASKED YOU TWO THINGS HOW COULD THAT?
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST.
Jon: SAM YOU HAD AMPLE TIME TO PREPARE.
PLEASE CONTINUE TO HOLD. WE'RE WORKING TO FIX THESE ERRORS AROUND THE (bleep).
Jon: I THINK YOU MEANT CLOCK.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK PLEASE CONTINUE TO HOLD.
Jon: JASON?
LOOK, JON, OUR FOUNDERS ESTABLISHED THIS GREAT NATION WITH ONE THOUGHT E PLURIBUS UNUM -- E PLURIBUS UNUM WHICH MEANS EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS.
SOME SAY IT MEANS THE STRONG EATS THE WEAK. BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A LESS CIVILIZED TIME.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
YOU ARE WELCOME. I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
DON'T TREAD ON ME, JON.
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, JASON JONES
