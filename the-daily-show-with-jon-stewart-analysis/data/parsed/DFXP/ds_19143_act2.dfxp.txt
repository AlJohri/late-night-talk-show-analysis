[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS AN ONGOING SITUATION. FOR MORE ON THE ISSUE IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI, WE TURN TO SENIOR MISSOURI CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL CHE. MICHAEL, TALK TO US VERY BRIEFLY. WHAT IS THE MOOD ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW IN FERGUSON.
BEATS ME, I'M NOT THERE. THERE ARE TOO MANY WHITE COPS WITH ITCHY TRIGGER FINGERS IN FERGUSON. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE IN ST. LOUIS WHERE IT'S SAFE. [LAUGHING]
Jon: ACTUALLY -- I MEAN -- I'M PRETTY SURE IN ST. LOUIS POLICE ACTUALLY SHOT AND KILLED A GENTLEMAN, A BLACK GENTLEMAN THREE DAYS AFTER THE FERGUSON SHOOTING. SO...
WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE IN A DIFFERENT ST. LOUIS?
Jon: NO, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THE ONE IN MISSOURI. I THINK IT'S UH...
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING. Jon: NO, BUT THIS IS, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MICHAEL. THIS IS GOOD. BECAUSE I CAN ASK YOU ABOUT THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY POLICE, AND THAT... WAIT, WHAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'M SORRY, JUST, CAN I ASK A QUESTION. WHERE -- I'M SORRY, MICHAEL. WHERE, WHERE ARE YOU?
JON, I'M AS FAR AWAY FROM THE SHOOT-ME STATE AS YOU CAN GET. OK? SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S RIGHT. NOTHING BUT SUN, SURFERS, AND PALM TREES.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT IN LA, ARE YOU? ARE YOU NEAR LA? BECAUSE THEY, LAPD RECENTLY SHOT AN UNARMED 25-YEAR-OLD BLACK MAN TO DEATH, THEY WERE...
FOR REAL? Jon: YEAH, I'M SORRY. IT JUST, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU. WAIT A MINUTE, WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
I'M IN THE SLEEPY SOUTH, JON. NOTHING TO FEAR IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. HOME OF THE 2012 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION -- YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME SOMETHING TERRIBLE, AREN'T YOU?
Jon: NO, NO. YES. LAST YEAR CHARLOTTE POLICE OFFICER GUNNED DOWN AN UNARMED COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYER WHO APPROACHED A WHITE WOMAN'S HOUSE FOR HELP AFTER CRASHING HIS CAR, AND [BLEEP] ALRIGHT... WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? MICHAEL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? COME...
I GOTTA FIND A PLACE WHERE THEY DON'T KILL SO MANY BLACK PEOPLE. AND I AIN'T GOING THERE. THEY KILLED A BLACK DUDE AT KROGER. LITTLE ROCK? UNARMED SENIOR CITIZEN. NO [BLEEP] FAIR AT ALL. NOPE, NOT NEW ORLEANS. THEY KILLED A KID IN A POT RAID. OH, NOT THERE EITHER. DUDE GOT SHOT IN HIS OWN DRIVEWAY FOR WEARING BAGGY PANTS. SHOT IN THE BACK WITH AN AR15. KILLED FOR PICKING UP A BB GUN IN WALMART. A [BLEEP] TOY BB GUN!
Jon: NO, MICHAEL, GET OUT OF THERE. YOU'VE GOTTA GO SOMEWHERE SAFE, MICHAEL! GO SOMEWHERE...
RELAX, JON.
Jon: ALRIGHT.
I'M NOT EVEN ON EARTH ANYMORE. NOWHERE IS SAFER FOR A BLACK MAN THAN THE INFINITE BLACKNESS OF OUTER SPACE. (SIRENS).
AW MAN, YOU'VE GOT TO BE [BEEP] KIDDING ME, MAN.
EXCUSE ME, SIR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU LIVE AROUND HERE.
IT'S SPACE. WE ALL LIVE AROUND HERE, SIR.
YEAH, THAT'S A PRETTY EXPENSIVE LOOKING SPACE HELMET THERE. YOU GOT A RECEIPT FOR THAT THING?
ACTUALLY I DO.
WOAH, WOAH, WOAH, HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM. AND TAKE THAT STOLEN HELMET OFF.
BUT I NEED THIS STOLEN HELMET TO BREATHE. I MEAN, MAN, I BOUGHT THIS HELMET. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING  ABOUT STOLEN?
ALRIGHT, THAT'S IT, DOWN ON THE GROUND. DOWN ON THE GROUND.
THERE IS NO GROUND, IT'S SPACE. PLEASE JUST DON'T SHOOT ME, MAN. PLEASE. Jon: ALRIGHT, MICHAEL, JUST DO WHAT HE SAYS. WE'LL SEND YOU A LAWYER ON THE NEXT ROCKET UP. HANG ON! OH BOY! MICHAEL CHE, EVERYBODY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. HANG IN THERE!
