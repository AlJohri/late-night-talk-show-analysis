[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A VERY DISTINCTIVE STYLE. HIS WEB SERIES IS CALLED "COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE."
SO I USED TO PUT 50-POUND BAGS OF LIME IN THE BACK. WHEN I WENT TO MY PROM, I HAD TO TAKE THE GIRL IN MY GREMLIN, SO I HAD A CAST, MR. JINX WHO HAD TO GO TO THE VET ON MY PROM NIGHT.
JUST THE SETUP HERE. IF YOU JUST STOP THERE, I LOVE THIS SETUP SO MUCH. CATS, GREMLIN, PROM NIGHT, LIME BAGS. YOU GOT FOUR BARRELS OF COMEDY.
I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING.
I DON'T CARE. I'M ALREADY SATISFIED.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JERRY SEINFELD. SIR! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOUNG MAN. PLEASE. I NEVER SAW THAT. THE ANIMATION. I HADN'T SEEN THAT.
THE ANIMATION. I HAD TO ANIMATE THE STORY.
Jon: I LOVED IT.
YEAH. SO, DID YOU KNOW THAT I DID THAT? DID I TELL YOU THAT YOU DID THAT?
Jon: NO, NO, NO.
SO JON TELLS THIS HILARIOUS STORY ON THE SHOW ABOUT HIS PROM NIGHT...
Jon: YES.
WHICH WAS SO COMPLICATED AND BIZARRE WITH VARIOUS STENCHES AND URINE AND BLEEDING --.
Jon: NOT MINE. MOSTLY NOT MINE.
MOSTLY NOT YOURS.
Jon: YES.
THAT SOMETIMES ON THE SHOW WHEN SOMEONE TELLS A REALLY CRAZY STORY, WE TURN IT INTO A CARTOON. SO WE DID THAT.
Jon: I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. MY FAVORITE PART OF THE ANIMATION LOOKS LIKE MY HEAD WITH ACNE.
WELL, THAT'S PROM NIGHT.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT IS AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF MY HEAD. THIS SHOW, I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I WAS WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO DO THIS, BECAUSE NOW IT HAS BECOME ONE OF THOSE SHOWS, LIKE WINNING AN AWARD...
REALLY?
Jon: LIKE WHEN YOU CALL AND GO, DO YOU WANT TO BE ON "COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE"? I WAS LIKE, YES! I'VE MADE IT.
REALLY?
Jon: IT'S THAT KIND OF THAT FOR COMEDIANS.
REALLY? OH, THAT'S GREAT.
Jon: YOU DON'T KNOW?
NO, I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST DOING, WHEN YOU DO THE THING, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE.
Jon: NO, IT'S NOT, THIS IS NOT AN EVENING AT THE IMPROV. WHERE YOU'RE THROWING UP...
REALLY?
Jon: THIS IS A VERY SELECT CLUB THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE INTO.
OH WELL. YEAH.
Jon: I WAS VERY EXCITED.
IT IS A VERY PERSONAL...
Jon: VERY PERSONAL.
IT'S JUST LIKE PEOPLE THAT I DIG FOR WHATEVER REASON OR ANOTHER. THAT'S...
Jon: AND HERE'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT, YOU'D BE DOING THIS ANYWAY.
ANYWAY. YEAH. I STILL HAVE TO EAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND GET A CUP OF COFFEE. BUT I FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT A SHOW.
Jon: AND YOU DO, I KNOW, YOU KNOW, YOU OFTEN GET BREAKFAST WITH OTHER COMICS. YOU OFTEN GET COFFEE WITH OTHER COMICS. THIS IS, WHAT, SEASON WHAT?
FOUR.
Jon: FOUR.
WELL, THEY'RE SHORT. THEY'RE ONLY SIX-EPISODE SEASONS.
Jon: SO YOU'RE REALLY PUTTING IN THE TIME.
OH YEAH, YES, YES.
Jon: YOU'RE DOING SIX EPISODES OF SOMETHING YOU'D BE DOING ANYWAY.
RIGHT. YEAH. SO I'M HAVING BREAKFAST AT LEAST SIX TIMES A YEAR.
Jon: WITH COMEDIANS.
WITH COMEDIANS. YEAH.
Jon: DO YOU THINK WHEN THE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE BECOMES TOO TAXING THE SHOW BECOMES "COMEDIANS IN CABS BRINGING JERRY COFFEE?"
YES. THAT COULD BE.
Jon: IT CHANGES.
YES. JERRY PUTS HIS FEET UP. BURPS. AND THAT'S THE SHOW.
Jon: WE WENT OUT TO NEW JERSEY TO THIS DINER.
THE TICKTOCK.
Jon: THE TICKTOCK, WHICH TURNED OUT AND I DIDN'T KNOW, BECAUSE YOU DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE GOING. >>RIGHT.
Jon:THE SHOW IS ABOUT TRUST.
YES.
Jon: YOU PULL UP AND SAY, GET IN MY CAR, AND WE JUST GO.
RIGHT. SO JON IS THE SEASON FINALE OF SEASON FOUR, THOSE OF YOU THAT ACTUALLY WATCH THE SHOW. AND IT WAS GREAT EPISODE. NOT ONLY DID WE TALK ABOUT DEATH AND CANCER, BUT WE FOUND A WAY TO WORK IN HITLER AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS. WE DID.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
AND CREMATION.
Jon: AND CREMATION.
AND CREMATION.
Jon: THAT IS TRUE. CREMATION WAS IN THERE.
I TALKED HOW I WANTED TO BE CREMATED AND THE ASHES POURED ON A BEACH.
Jon: YES.
AND YOU SAID, "DON'T YOU THEY WOULD DISTURB THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH."
Jon: YES.
AND I SAID... DON'T YOU THINK, SO YOU SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING"? WELL, WE'RE SPREADING JERRY SEINFELD. I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD GO, OH, I LOVE THAT SHOW.
OH, I LOVE THAT SHOW. LET ME SEE THOSE ASHES. IT TURNS OUT, SO THE DINER WE WENT TO, WHICH I DIDN'T REALIZE, IS THE DINER, HOW WE GOT ONTO DEATH, AFTER MY GRANDFATHER'S FUNERAL...
YEAH. RIGHT. YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE ME TO NEW JERSEY ALMOST ANYWHERE, CHANCES ARE ONE OF MY RELATIVES IS BURIED NEARBY. AND SO WE WENT TO THIS DINER, AND THEN TO THE PET STORE.
AND THEN TO THE PET STORE.
Jon: BECAUSE IT'S FUN.
SO, THERE'S ANOTHER THING I HAVE TO PLUG ON THE SHOW.
Jon: PLEASE.
WE CAME UP WITH A NEW... SO THE SHOW, WE DO THESE SIX EPISODES.
Jon: YES.
THEN THE SHOW GOES AWAY FOR LIKE FOUR MONTHS. WE CAME UP...
Jon: SURE. YOU HAVE TO REST.
WE HAVE TO REST.
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU PROBABLY, YOU GET OUT YOUR INHALER. YOU GO TO...
YEAH. YEAH. I'M TIRED FROM THAT LITTLE PIECE OF TOAST...
Jon: SURE.
YEAH. AND STIRRING THE COFFEE.
Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE.
YEAH. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE MADE UP A NEW SHOW THAT'S GOING TO EXIST BETWEEN THE SEASONS CALLED SINGLE SHOT, WHICH IS LIKE A LITTLE ESPRESSO.
Jon: NICE.
SO EVERY THURSDAY NOW AT NOON, THERE'S GONNA BE A TWO-MINUTE EPISODE WITH LIKE FIVE OR SIX COMEDIANS TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING THAT WE MADE FROM STUFF WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE VAULT.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU SO [BLEEPED] LAZY. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I'M OUR HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, SEINFELD. YOU'RE TAKING... YOU'RE JUST HAVING...YOU DON'T EVEN DO IT. YOU HAVE AN EDITOR.
AND, I HAVE ALREADY BEEN THE GUY WHO PISSES YOU OFF  THE  MOST BECAUSE THE WAY I FIGURED OUT TV, THAT YOU DO IT ONCE AND THEN YOU GET TO STOP.
Jon: I KNOW. I KNOW. HE IS... CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
SO NOW I'VE DONE IT AGAIN. I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
Jon: I KNOW.
I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
Jon: I KNOW. IT'S SO BRILLIANT.  I ALWAYS SAY TO HIM, YOU DID THE PERFECT SHOW, YOU DID IT FOR THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF TIME, AND IT LIVES ON, I STILL WATCH YOUR SHOW EVER NIGHT.
YEAH.
Jon: WHEN I LEAVE HERE, THAT'S IT. DEAD. NOTHING.
THAT'S IT. NO ONE IS WATCHING. YEAH.
Jon: NOBODY CARES. I LEAVE HERE, MY ASHES ARE SPREAD ON THE... YEAH IT DOESN'T MATTER.
