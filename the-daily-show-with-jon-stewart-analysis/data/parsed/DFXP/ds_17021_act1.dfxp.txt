NOVEMBER 14, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT. NOBEL PAEZ PRIZE WINNER LEYMAH GBOWEE GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. THE PRESSING QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY DEBATES? HERE'S A CLUE. SATURDAY NIGHT'S,000th REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS AN HOUR-AND-A-HALF. BUT CBS ONLY AIRED ONE HOUR OF IT SO THEY COULD STILL BRING YOU, THE VIEWER, A FRESH  N.C.I.S. RERUN. CBS WANTED PEOPLE TO LEARN SOMETHING. ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN WORK. ALL RIGHT. BUT THE FIRST HOUR STILL PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW COMPELLING STORY LINES. WOULD GINGRICH'S RECENT POLL SURGE CONTINUE. DOES ME SAYING POLL SURGE MAKE YOU THINK OF HERMAN CAIN? WOULD RICK PERRY FINALLY THINK OF THAT THIRD THING? IF YOU BET RON PAUL WAS OVER 90 SECONDS OF SPEAKING TIME, WOULD YOU LOSE THAT BET? THE ANSWER IS YES, YES, AND... MOST IMPORTANTLY HAS MITT ROMNEY'S STUDY OF HUMANS PAID OFF. COULD HE MANIPULATE HIS FACIAL STRUCTURE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO AAPPEAR TO BE LISTENING TO HIS  OPPONENTS INTENTLY YET SKEPTICALLY. NO, THAT SAYS MORE LIKE I'M PRETENDING I'M WATCHING A PUPPY PLAY WITH A BALL. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS I BELIEVE WHAT I SMELL IS POPCORN. THAT ONE SAYS I'M CURRENTLY WATCHING A WOMAN CRUSH A SMALL ANIMAL WITH HER HEEL. OR RICK PERRY. IT'S CALLED MITT FACE. IT'S SWEEPING THE NATION. OR AT LEAST IT WAS UNTIL HIS CAMPAIGN GOT AN INJUNCTION FROM THE PRODUCERS OF THE  INDIE HORROR FILM MITT FACE. A BASEBALL PLAYER INVOLVED IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION AT THE PLAY AT THE PLATE ENDED UP WITH MITT FACE. I'M NOT SURE WHY I HAD TO YELL THAT AT YOU. ON THE TO THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE OF THE DEB. THE SUBJECT WAS FOREIGN POLICY. ALL THE CANDIDATES SEEMED TO AGREE AMERICA TO NEEDS TO START KICKING THE WORLD'S ASS  AND TAKE SOME FUNNY SOUNDING NAMES.
WE HAVE TO HAVE CHINA UNDERSTAND THAT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE WORLD STAGE THEY  HAVE TO PLAY BY THE RULES.
THE CORRECT THING IN AN ACT OF WAR IS TO KILL PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.
FOR EVERY COUNTRY THE FOREIGN BUDGET WILL START AT ZERO DOLLARS.
Jim: I THINK I HAVE THE REPUBLICAN TAKE ON FOREIGN POLICY. IT'S, OH, WHAT IS IT? BOOM, B AND-BOOM. CHINA, IRAN, PAKISTAN. BA-BOOM. WE'RE BACK, BABY. WHAT'S THAT? OH, CRAZY GAZER SATAN LADY. YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING.
I WOULD NOT AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT TO PULL ALL FOREIGN AID FROM PAKISTAN.
Jon: LADY WHO BELIEVES HP- VACCINES CALLED RETARDATION. WHAT?
PAKISTAN HAS A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THE NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAS TO UNDERSTAND FROM DAY ONE THE INTRICACYS THAT ARE  HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
Jon: YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES BECAUSE ALL THE CRAZY (BEEP) YOU SAY, IT'S EASY TO FOR GET  YOU SIT ON THE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE. YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT PAKISTAN. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL BE REASONABLE. LET'S GO TO THIS GUY RICK SANTORUM. GIVE US FOREIGN POLICY RED MEAT, BROTHER.
YOU DON'T COW BOY THIS ONE. YOU DON'T FLY INTO PAKISTAN AND TRY TO INTERDICT A NUCLEAR WEAPON. YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH THE PEOPLE IN POWER IN THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon: (BEEP)? ALL RIGHT. YOU WERE ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE SO YOU KNOW PAKISTAN AND IRAN ARE  COMPLICATED ISSUES. IF ONLY EVERYTHING WAS AS SIMPLE AS GAY PEOPLE ARE ANIMALS. YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING. AT LEAST NO ONE IS GOING TO CHALLENGE MITT ROMNEY'S CHINA BETTER WISE THE (BEEP) UP, RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA.
Jon: UNLESS YOU SEE BECAUSE WE NEED A REAL WAR WITH CHINA.
WHO DOES IT HURT? OUR SMALL BUSINESSES.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT CHINA? FORMER AMBASSADOR TO CHINA? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? FOR MORE ON THESE THREE REPUBLICANS, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT  AASIF MANDVI. AASIF....
(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU KNOW, WATCHING THIS DEBATE, SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE KILLING IT. THEY'RE DOING RED MEAT. WHAT WAS UP WITH HUNTSMAN, BACHMANN AND SANTORUM.
JON, THEIR NUANCED ANSWERS TO REAL WORLD PROBLEMS WAS A HUGE GAFFE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR CAMPAIGNS WILL SURVIVE IT.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYWAY FOR THEM TO SPIN MASTERY OF THE ISSUES AS A  KIND OF STRENGTH?
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, NO. KNOWLEDGE IS LIKE KRYPTONITE HERE. IT SAPS YOUR CONFIDENCE AND WEAKENS YOUR TALKING POINTS. HERE'S RICK PERRY WHEN HE WAS LEADING THE RACE.
ANYBODY THAT IS FOR THE STATUS QUO WITH SOCIAL SECURITY TODAY IS INVOLVED  WITH A MONSTEROUS LIE. IT IS A PONZI SCHEME.
Jon: THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
Reporter: FORCEFUL.
Jon: LACKED COHERENCE.
Reporter: TOTALLY OFF BASE. THEY LOVED IT. LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PERRY HAS TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE HE ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT.
IF YOU SAY THAT WE SHOULD NOT EDUCATE CHILDREN WHO HAVE COME INTO OUR STATE FOR NO  OTHER REASON THAN THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT THERE BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, I DON'T THINK YOU  HAVE A HEART. TEXANS VOTED ON IT. AND I STILL SUPPORT IT GREATLY. (CHEERING AND BOOS).
Reporter: YEAH, YEAH. TOO PRAGMATIC. THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS ELECTRIFIED ALLIGATOR MOAT.
Jon: NICE. ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT EXPENSIVE. YOU GET YOUR....
Reporter: BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT SEE THAT'S THE KIND OF OBSESSING OVER DETAILS THAT SANK PERRY. NO ONE WANTS A GOVERNOR WHO GRAPPLES WITH THE REALITIES OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THEY WANT THE GOVERNOR WHO FIGHTS WILD FIRES BY PRAYING FOR RAIN.
Jon: WHY DOES KNOWLEDGE OF ISSUES AND FACTS, WHY IS IT A DETRIMENT?
IT PINS YOU DOWN, JON. IT FORCES YOU TO DEAL WITH A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE'S WORST ENEMY: REALITY. WITHOUT IT, YOU'RE FLYING HIGH. NO MONEY FOR PAKISTAN. SHOVE IT, CHINA. BUT THEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH A COUPLE OF INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES AND MAYBE GET  FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION AND PRETTY SOON, IF WE HAVE MILITARY AID WITH A  STRONG DOMESTIC... (SCREAMING).
Jon: SO KNOWING STUFF, REALIZING THE REALITY OF YOUR SITUATION, IS THE ENEMY.
WELL IT JUST COMPLICATES YOUR DECISION-MAKING. LET'S TRY A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT, OKAY. YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: OH, I LIKE THAT. THAT'S NICE.
YOU'VE TRACKED A TERRORIST TO HIS LAIR. YOU'LL KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE UNTIL YOU BLOW THEM UP WITH A DRONE. WHAT DO YOU DO.
Jon: RELEASE THE DRONE.
YOU JUST GOT INFORMATION THAT HIS LAIR IS A KINDERGARTEN FULL OF CHILDREN. DO YOU STILL WANT TO BLOW IT UP NOW?
Jon: NO, NO. SEND IN THE SEAL TEAMS, GET THE KIDS OUT AND THEN....
THINK AGAIN. THINK AGAIN BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE ROBOT DECOYS FILLED WITH NERVE GAS. SEALS WON'T LAST TEN SECONDS IN THERE.
Jon: (BEEP) THE KIDS. SEND THE DRONES BACK IN. GOING WITH THE DRONES.
BAD NEWS. THAT KINDERGARTEN IS ON TOP OF A DAM. YOU BLOW IT UP, THE TOWNSPEOPLE BELOW WILL DROWN.
Jon: WHY WOULD YOU BILL A KINDERGARTEN ON TOP OF A DAM?
STAY FOCUSED, MR. PRESIDENT. TIME IS RUNNING OUT. LET'S GO.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO THIS. SNIPER TAKES OUT THE TERRORIST. SWAT TEAM SECURES THE DAM. YES, THE TOWN IS SAVED.
YES, CONGRATULATIONS.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D MAKE AN EXCELLENT PRESIDENT.
ONE OF THE WOMEN YOU SAVED FROM DROWNING WAS PREGNANT WITH ADOLPH HITLER. WELL DONE.
Jon: DAM IT. YOU NEVER SAID THIS WAS IN THE PAST.
YOU SEE HOW MUCH MORE DECISIVE YOU WERE THOUGH WHEN YOUR MIND WASN'T CAUGHT UP  WITH FACTS. YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE HOLOCAUST.
Jon: I GUESS A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING.
AND I GUESS VOTING FOR HERMAN CAIN IS THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT THE HOLOCAUST.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY.
