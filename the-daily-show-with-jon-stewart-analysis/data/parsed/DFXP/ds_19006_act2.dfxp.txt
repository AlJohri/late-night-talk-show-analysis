[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. LISTEN. IF YOU WERE AN ASTUTE OBSERVER OF POLITICS YOU MAY HAVE NOTED WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS FALLEN INTO WHAT MANY EXPERTS ARE CALLING INTO A SINK HOLE (bleep). IS THERE A WAY OUT? JASON JONES REPORTS.
REPUBLICANS ARE REFUSING TO BACK OFF OBAMACARE AND PASS A CLEAN BUDGET SENDING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN INTO ITS SECOND WEEK. I DECIDED TO TAKE A CRACK AT FIXING THIS MESS BY SITTING DOWN WITH G.O.P. STRATEGIST. LET'S SOLVE THIS RIGHT NOW.
LET'S DO IT.
WE JUST WANT OUR GOVERNMENT BACK OPEN. WHAT DO WE DO?
DEFUND OBAMACARE. THE G.O.P. IS TRYING TO SAVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM A DISASTER OF A HEALTH CARE PLAN. WE DON'T HAVE JOY IN THE SHUTDOWN.
Reporter: CAN YOU JUST GIVE US BACK OUR GOVERNMENT AND WHEN YOU DO INCLUDE OBAMACARE BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW.
IT IS LAW BUT IT'S NOT GOOD LAW. IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Reporter: EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT DEEMED IT CONSTITUTIONAL.
THE SUPREME COURT DEEMED IT CONSTITUTIONAL BUT IT HAD TO GO TO THE SUPREME COURT TO DO SO. AND THEY STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THE BILL.
Reporter: THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T READ THE BILL? I FEEL THE SAME WAY. CAN WE STOP THIS WHOLE INTERVIEW, PLEASE. IT'S JUST A VICIOUS CIRCLE. YOU DIG YOUR HEELS IN. YOU SAY SOMETHING STUPID.
IT'S A STUPID LAW.
Reporter: AND I GIVE A GENERICALLY WITTY RESPONSE LIKE YES, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IS STUPID. AND THEN THESE DUMMIES LAUGH. BUT WHERE DOES IT END?
IT ENDS WITH DEFUNDING OBAMACARE.
Reporter: (bleep). I'M DONE. I HATE THIS JOB. IT WAS CLEAR WHAT THIS SITUATION HAD BECOME. WE HAVE A HOSTAGE SITUATION.
YOU ARE HOLDING THIS COUNTRY HOSTAGE.
YOU DON'T GET TO EXTRACT A RANSOM FOR DOING YOUR JOB.
Reporter: I ENLISTED THE HELP OF FORMER F.B.I. HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR CHRISTOPHER BOSS. WHY DO PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO TAKE HOSTAGES. IN THEIR WORLD THEY TRIED A LOT OF THINGS AND EVERYTHING THEY'VE TRIED UP TIL THEN HAS FAILED. THEY VIEW THEMSELVES AS SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE AND THEY ARE MYSTIFIED THEY ARE NOT FOLLOWED MORE AND HURT BY IT AND THEY FEEL ABANDONED BY IT.
Reporter: I THOUGHT CALLING IN A HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IS FUNNY AND A FUNNY JOKE BUT IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW THIS METAPHOR IS LINING UP.
EVEN BAT (bleep) INSANE HAS ITS OWN RULES. YOU FIND OUT WHAT THE RULES ARE AND NAVIGATE WITHIN THEM.
HE PREPPED ME WITH THE TECHNIQUES HE ACQUIRED THROUGH 15 YEARS OF SERVICE.
DON'T BE CONDESCENDING AND TRY TO SEE IT FROM HER PERSPECTIVE.
Reporter: DON'T BE CONDESCENDING? THAT'S ALL I KNOW HOW TO BE. FINALLY IT WAS GO TIME AND I HAD TO STAY FOCUSED. SAY SOMETHING INNOCUOUS GET HER TALKING. MY NAME IS JASON JONES. I'M HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU. WHAT ARE YOUR DEMANDS.
CAN YOU PUT THE  MICROPHONE DOWN.
Reporter: IT'S CALLED A MEGAPHONE.
DON'T BE CONDESCENDING. TALK ABOUT THE THINGS SHE MIGHT LIKE. TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND.
NOELLE TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW OBAMACARE WILL HURT SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES.
IT'S DISASTROUS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
Reporter: I CAN'T KEEP THIS UP IT'S STUPID.
IT'S NOT STUPID TO HER. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE EVEN IN HER WORLD THIS MAKES SENSE.
Reporter: PLEASE CONTINUE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS. HE TAUGHT ME THAT KEEPING THE HOSTAGE TAKER TALKING IS CRUCIAL NO MATTER WHAT IS COMING OUT OF THEIR MOUTH.
OBAMACARE IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE WORST THINGS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Reporter: ONE OF THE WORST THINGS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, HUH? DO YOU REMEMBER (bleep) SLAVERY?
NO, NO, DON'T ATTACK.
Reporter: SORRY, SORRY. I CAN'T CALL HER ON SLAVERY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
I REALIZE WHAT SHE JUST SAID IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS AND IT IGNORES THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES BUT IT'S HER PERSPECTIVE.
Reporter: I BEGAN TO REALIZE THERE WAS ONE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS HOSTAGE NEGOTIATION.
WE DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT IN OUR HEALTH CARE. WE DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES. WE NEED A SMALLER GOVERNMENT.
Reporter: AND THAT PROBLEM IS THAT NOT MATTER WHAT WE DO THE G.O.P. IS HOLDING SOMETHING HOSTAGE THAT THEY DON'T VALUE. YOU ARE SAYING YOU ARE GOING TO MAIM THE THING YOU ARE HOLDING HOSTAGE REGARDLESS?
WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR LESS GOVERNMENT.
Reporter: YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY WE'LL LET THE HOSTAGE GO SAFELY. THAT'S HOSTAGE TAKING 101.
PLEASE, WE'RE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TAKING HOSTAGES. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT SOMEONE IN THE BUSINESS TAKE HOSTAGES YOU NEED TO LOOK AT OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRAT CIRCUS.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU IN MY 20 PLUS YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.
Reporter: LOOKS LIKE WE WIN NO ONE WINS IN THIS CASE. THE GOP DOES. >>IT'S NOT A [BLEEP] GAME!
