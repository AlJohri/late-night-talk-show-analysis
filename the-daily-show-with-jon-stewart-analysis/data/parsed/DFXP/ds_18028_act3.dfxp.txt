(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, WE'RE  TALKING WITH WARREN BUFFETT AND  CAROL LOOMIS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE  BIT ABOUT -- I CONSIDER YOU SORT  OF AN ICON OF THE VALUE ECONOMY AS OPPOSED TO -- I DON'T EVEN  WANT TO SAY THE GROWTH ECONOMY,  BUT THIS, LIKE -- FOR INSTANCE, THE FINANCIAL SECTOR BECAME -- I  DON'T KNOW THE EXACT TERM, BUT  SOMETHING LIKE 20% OF OUR ECONOMY OVER THE LAST TEN OR 20  YEARS. THAT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL  VOLATILE SECTOR TO BE RELIED  UPON TO DRIVE THAT MUCH OF THE  G.D.P. IS THAT INCORRECT OR CORRECT?
WELL, MORE AND MORE THE  "FORBES" 400 COME FROM THE  FINANCIAL ARENA. WE'VE GOT A HUGE ECONOMY AND  PEOPLE THAT CATCH THE CRUMBS  FALLING OFF THE TABLE CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
Jon: THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY  HONORABLE WAY TO DESCRIBE THEM. (LAUGHTER)  CRUMB CATCHERS! (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU THINK WE HAVE A  SATISFACTORY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC  POLICY?
WELL, I THINK WHAT MADE  AMERICA GREAT IS GOING TO  CONTINUE TO WORK. BUT I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE  LAST YEAR -- COUPLE OF YEARS  WASHINGTON'S KIND OF TESTED THE PATIENCE OF THE REST OF -- T --  BUT WE'VE GOT 312 MILLION PEOPLE  THAT I DON'T THINK 535 CAN IMPEDE THEIR PROGRESS OVER TIME.
Jon: NOW, YOU GUYS HAVE  BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME.
45 YEARS.
Jon: 45 YEARS. HE IS -- I DON'T KNOW, THE  EIGHTH LARGEST COMPANY OR THE --
I THINK IT'S SEVENTH,  ACTUALLY. ANYWAY, HIGH.
Jon: AND YOU'RE A VERY NICE  WOMAN WHO'S DONE VERY WELL FOR  YOURSELF. DO YOU RESENT HIS SUCCESS? (LAUGHTER)  ARE YOU A -- WHEN YOU TALK TO  HIM, DO YOU SAY "WHY DON'T YOU  DISTRIBUTE THE WEALTH?"
THAT'S THE INITIAL FIVE  MINUTES OF EVERY CONVERSATION WE  HAVE. (LAUGHTER)  I GET INTO THIS.
Jon: THE FIRST QUESTION SHE  ASKS ME IS "WHY AREN'T I IN YOUR  WILL?"  (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELL, LET ME JUST --  WHY ISN'T SHE IN YOUR WILL? (LAUGHTER)
NOW I WANT TO HEAR THE  ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)
LET'S CHANGE THE SUBJECT. I WILL POINT OUT IN THE LAST TEN  YEARS I HAVE PROBABLY PAID  TAXES-- COUNTING PAYROLL TAXES-- AT A LOWER RATE THAN CAROL HAS. IT'S WRONG.
Jon: IS IT BECAUSE WE'VE  GOT ON THE A PLACE WHERE WE ARE  VALUING THE INVESTOR CLASS MORE THAN THE WORKING CLASS? BECAUSE I'M STUNNED NOW AT THE  CONFLATION OF UNOBSTRUCTED  CAPITALISM AND THE AMERICAN  DREAM. SOMEHOW THAT'S BEEN CONFLATED ON  THAT SIDE OF THE RIGHT WING  ECONOMICS THAT YOU CANNOT IMPEDE THE CAPITALISTS IN ANY WAY IF  YOU WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM. BUT THAT STRIKES ME AS FALSE. THAT UNIONS, WORKER PROTECTIONS,  THAT'S AN INOCULATION AGAINST  SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM.
YEAH, THEY THINK THAT I  SHOULD BE A PROTECTED SPECIES,  KIND OF LIKE THE BALD EAGLE OR SOME KIND OF THING. THAT IF ANYTHING IS DONE IT WILL  KILL -- I'M PLAY SOMEPLACE ELSE,  EXACTLY. AND 20 YEARS AGO, THE "FORBES"  400 HAD AN AGGREGATE WEALTH OF  $300 BILLION. NOW IT'S MORE THAN QUINTUPLED. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED WITH THE  MIDDLE-CLASS.
Jon: ALSO, PRODUCTIVITY OF  WORKERS HAS DOUBLED YET MEDIAN  INCOME HAS STAYED STAGNANT.
YEAH. YEAH.
VERY TRUE.
AND I DON'T THINK THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC REALLY  UNDERSTANDS THAT. IT KIND OF SNUCK UP ON THEM. THE TAX RATE -- I MEAN, YOU'VE  GOT -- OF THE 400 HIGHEST  INCOMES IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2009, THE MOST RECENT YEARS WE  HAVE FIGURES FOR, A QUARTER OF  THE PEOPLE PAID TAXES AT A RATE LESS THAN 15%. THE PAYROLL TAX WAS 15.3% IN  THAT YEAR. AND SIX OF THEM PAID NOTHING AT  ALL. I MEAN, THEY WEREN'T PART OF THE  47%. -- THEY WERE PART OF THE 47%. THESE PEOPLE WERE BIG-TIME  MOOCHERS. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: OH, PEOPLE ARE GOING  TO CLAP FOR THAT. WE'LL RUN OUT OF TIME. BUT THIS IDEA THAT BECAUSE IN  BANGLADESH AND CHINA THEY ACCEPT  WORKING CONDITIONS THAT AMERICANS WOULD NOT CONSIDER  OPTIMAL THAT YOU CAN'T ASK FOR  ANYTHING ANYMORE BECAUSE, HEY, MAN, WE'LL JUST SEND OUR STUFF  OVER THERE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THERE  HAS TO BE SOME SENSE OF DOMESTIC  POLICY THAT KEEPS THAT IN THERE,  YES?
RIGHT.
Jon: WELL, I'M VERY GLAD. I WOULD LIKE THE TWO OF YOU, IF  I MAY, TO KEEP YOU IN A CURIO  CABINET. BECAUSE YOU ARE THE TWO NICEST  PEOPLE I THINK I'VE MET. (LAUGHTER)  AND IF I COULD JUST KEEP YOU IN  THERE AND OPEN IT AND GO IN AND  TAKE A PEEK AT YOU EVERY NOW AND  THEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WARREN BUFFETT, IT'S ON THE BACK  SHELVES NOW, "TAP DANCING TO WORK."  TWO OF THE NICEST COMMUNISTS YOU  WILL EVER MEET IN YOUR LIFE. WARREN BUFFETT AND CAROL LOOMIS. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY AND "FORTUNE"  MAGAZINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
