[APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OBVIOUSLY, THE WORLD IS FOCUSED ON SYRIA RIGHT NOW, BUT THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST IS A TINDER BOX, VOLATILE, UNSTABLE. THE UNITED STATES MUST TAKE THE GREATEST OF CARE WITH OUR APPROACH TO THE EMBATTLED AND FRAGILE REGION.
REPRESENTATIVE MICHELE BACHMANN, LOUIS GOHMERT AND STEVE KING WERE IN EGYPT OVER THE WEEKEND AND GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE ON EGYPTIAN TV. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: PLEASE BE A JIMMY KIMMEL PRANK. PLEASE BE A JIMMY KIMMEL PRANK. PLEASE BE A JIMMY KIMMEL PRANK. NOPE. APPARENTLY THEY WERE ON A DIPLOMATIC MISSION.
MY NAME IS MICHELE BACHMANN, AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Jon: THEY'VE ONLY SAID ONE SENTENCE, AND THIS IS ALREADY THE WEIRDEST [BLEEP] THING I'VE SEEN ON TELEVISION. WHY IS SHE TALKING LIKE THAT? IS SHE ADDRESSING AN EGYPTIAN KINDERGARTEN? BACHMANN, GOMERT AND KING WENT TO EGYPT TO SAY TO THE GOOD AND KIND PEOPLE IN EGYPT THAT THE GROWING PAINS THEIR COUNTRY IS EXPERIENCING IN ITS TEMPORARY MILITARILY IMPOSED RESPITE FROM DEMOCRACY CAN BE CURED WITH A QUICK SHOT OF VITAMIN AMERICA.
I'M REMINDED OF THE WORDS OF THOMAS PAINE, HE SAID IN AMERICA LAW IS KING.
OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IS THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ALLOW A GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION.
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WROTE A MESSAGE I THINK WILL RESONATE.
THOMAS JEFFERSON.
GEORGE WASHINGTON.
THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THAT I CARRY IN MY POCKET EVERY DAY I WEAR A JACKET.
Jon: AND ANOTHER THING, WHAT IS WITH YOUR ROUND BREAD? IT MAKES NO [BLEEP] SENSE. YOU CAN'T GET INTO IT. THERE IS NO WAY TO FILL IT WITH SANDWICH. IN AMERICA, WE USE SLICED SQUARE BREAD. I THINK YOU'LL AGREE IT IS EASIER TO HANDLE. YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. WHY AM I TALKING LIKE A BROOKLYN GUY WITH THESE PEOPLE. IT IS THE ONE TIME I COULD HAVE USED MY SOUTHERN GUY. I NEED MY AFRO BACK. COULD THESE THREE PEOPLE BE ANY MORE CONDESCENDING? I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT IN AMERICA. WE WANT THOSE VALUES THAT WE TREASURE IN AMERICA, THOSE VALUES THAT SERVED OUR COUNTRY AND ALLOWED US TO BUILD UP SO STRONG FROM NOTHING -- WE WERE NOTHING 236 YEARS AGO. TODAY WE ARE STRONG.
Jon: MAYBE SOME DAY, EGYPT, YOU'LL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BUILD SOMETHING LASTING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: MAYBE. ALL RIGHT, COME ON! WRAP IT UP, YOU THREE.
I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL MAY HAVE, AND IF YOU DO, WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. [LAUGHTER]
THE ONE QUESTION THAT HAS COME FORWARD AGAIN IS --
Jon: THERE IS NO WAY IN THAT TIME THEY TOOK A REAL QUESTION. IT TOOK LONGER TO SAY THE WORDS, HELLO, I HAVE A QUESTION. AT THIS POINT, I'M NOT REALLY SURE YOU'RE IN EGYPT. LOOK AT THESE GUYS. ARE THEY IN A VACUUM? IS THAT WHERE THEY FAKED THE MOON LANDING? ARE THEY CHAINED TOGETHER? IS THIS A HOSTAGE VIDEO. THEY ALL LOOK LIKE THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO GET MUSLIM ON THEM. NOT THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM. HONESTLY THE VIBE OF THIS WHOLE THING IS NERVOUS DELEGATION OF EARTHLINGS MEET ALIENS IN A SCI-FI MOVIE. IF I MAY ADDRESS THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE MYSELF, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO FIX THIS. WE SENT OVER OUR OWN DELEGATION TO UNDO SOME OF THAT DAMAGE. HERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW IN EGYPT. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
THANK YOU, JON. HELLO, MY NAME IS SAMANTHA BEE, AND I AM AN AMERICAN FROM THE AMERICAN UNITED STATES OF AMERICAN STATES IN AMERICA. AND ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES, I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT FOR SENDING YOU LITERALLY THE THREE STUPIDEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
SORRY FOR THAT.
THANK YOU, SAM. EGYPT, I'D LIKE TO, IF I MAY, SHOW YOU SOMETHING THAT I PUT IN MY JACKET EVERY DAY THAT I WEAR ONE. IT'S CALLED BACON. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
AND IT'S CURED PORK, AND WE EAT IT AND WE LOVE IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T. [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
OKAY, WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE QUESTION. EXCELLENT QUESTION. YES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WHEN THOSE THREE CONGRESS PEOPLE ARE UNSUPERVISED, THEY EAT THEIR OWN (bleep).
ANY MORE QUESTIONS? WOW, SO MANY QUESTIONS. SO MANY ACTUALLY QUESTIONS FROM REAL, ACTUAL EGYPTIANS.
OH, MY GOSH, WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOU ARE SO BAD.
HEY, HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE. OVER HERE. LOOK AT THIS.
OH, MY GOSH. EGYPTIANS ARE SO NICE. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. SAMANTHA BEE, BOB ODENKIRK, DAVID CROSS IN EGYPT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
