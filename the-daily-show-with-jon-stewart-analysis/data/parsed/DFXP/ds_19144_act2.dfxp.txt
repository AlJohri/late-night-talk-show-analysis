[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. JOIN ME NOW, JOIN ME NOW AS I ATTEMPT PERHAPS THE GREATEST FEAT KNOWN TO MODERN FAKE NEWSCASTING. I'M ABOUT TO REPORT A NON-DEPRESSING STORY ABOUT A YOUNG BLACK MAN IN THE AREA OF ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI. MICHAEL SAM, YESTERDAY HE TOOK ONE STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING THE FIRST OPENLY GAY MAN TO PLAY A REGULAR SEASON NFL GAME. HE ADVANCED TO THE ST. LOUIS RAMS 75-MAN ROSTER. OF COURSE, ESPN HAS BEEN COVERING HIS PERFORMANCE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
HOW IS HE FITTING IN WITH HIS RAMS TEAMMATES SO FAR?
WELL JAY, DEFENSIVE TACKLE KENDALL LANGFORD SAID THAT MICHAEL SAM IS JUST SIMPLY ONE OF THE GUYS. BUT ANOTHER RAMS DEFENSIVE PLAYER TOLD ME THAT, "SAM IS RESPECTING OUR SPACE AND THAT FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE HE SEEMS TO THINK THAT MICHAEL SAM IS WAITING TO KIND OF TAKE A SHOWER AS NOT TO MAKE HIS TEAMMATES FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE." [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHY WOULD HIS TEAMMATES FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE SHOWERING WITH MICHAEL SAM? DOES HE USE AXE GARLIC AND ROTTEN EGG BODY WASH? DOES MICHAEL SAM HAVE A KUATO? TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS EITHER. [LAUGHTER] MICHAEL SAM'S GAY. ARE WE NOT OVER THIS YET?
NOW WHILE LANGFORD TOLD ME, "LISTEN I HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE SHOWER AT THE SAME TIME AS MICHAEL SAM, HE SAID THAT THERE DEFINITELY COULD BE A MILLION REASONS AS TO WHY THAT IS. HE SAID HE COULD BE DOING EXTRA WORK ON THE PRACTICE FIELD. HE COULD BE RIDING HIS BIKE, HE COULD BE DOING EXTRA CARDIO."
Jon: YES, THOSE ARE ALL THE MOST LIKELY THINGS A FOOTBALL PLAYER MIGHT BE DOING, BUT HE COULDN'T HE ALSO BE SINGING SHOW TUNES OR BINGE WATCHING BRAVO. ESPN VIEWERS NEED TO KNOW. FOR MORE LET'S JUST GO OUT TO SENIOR SPORTS CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE. SAMANTHA BEE LIVE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LIVE AT RAMS' TRAINING CAMP OUTSIDE OF ST. LOUIS. SAMANTHA, THE FINAL CUT TO 53 PLAYERS IS GONNA BE ON SATURDAY.
YES.
Jon: HOW ARE MICHAEL SAM'S PROSPECTS TO MAKE THIS TEAM?
WELL JON...
Jon: WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING?
JON, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE SAM IS IN TROUBLE.
Jon: NOW, YOU DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO MAKE THE TEAM? HAS HE BEEN PLAYING LESS WELL THAN HAS BEEN REPORTED?
NO, NO, NO, NO. HIS WORK ON THE LINE HAS BEEN GREAT, BUT HE'S BEEN MAKING HIS TEAMMATES VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
Jon: WELL, ACTUALLY THEY SAID HE'S BEEN RESPECTING THEM. HE HASN'T BEEN SHOWERING WITH THEM.
NO, NO, NO. IN FACT, HE HASN'T BEEN GETTING NAKED AROUND THEM AT ALL. JON, THERE'S BEEN NO GRAB-ASS, NO DICK SNAPS, NO BALL CUPPING, NONE OF THE LOCKER ROOM BEHAVIOR OF NORMAL, HETEROSEXUAL NFL PLAYERS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I KNOW THE LOCKER ROOM CAN GET A LITTLE, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER THERE, THE GRAB-ASSY CULTURE. IT'S NOT THAT BAD, THOUGH.
OH, IT ISN'T, JON? WELL, I HAPPEN TO HAVE A COPY OF THE 2008 NFL EXPOSE, "BOYS WILL BE BOYS." DO YOU REMEMBER CHARLES HAYLEY?
Jon: NO, I DON'T, A LINEBACKER FOR THE 49ers, TWO-TIME NFC DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR, MORE THAN 100 CAREER SACKS.
YEAH. HAYLEY WOULD STROLL UP TO AN UNSUSPECTING TEAMMATE, WHIP OUT HIS PHALLUS AND REPEATEDLY STROKE IT IN HIS FACE. A PHALLUS IS A [BLEEPED], JON.
Jon: I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM.
HE WOULD WRAP HIS HAND AROUND HIS PENIS, TURN TOWARD JOE MONTANA AND BELLOW, "YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO SUCK THIS."
Jon: THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR.
UH-HUH.
Jon: JOE MONTANA LED THE 49ers TO FOUR SUPER BOWL WINS. CHARLES HAYLEY SHOULD BE SUCKING HIS [BLEEPED].
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY, JON. YOU KNOW WHAT, REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHICH TOTALLY STRAIGHT PRO FOOTBALL PLAYER SHOULD BE BLOWING THE OTHER. THE POINT IS: IF MICHAEL SAM WANTS TO FIT INTO THE NFL, HE BETTER CUT THE SHY ACT AND GAY IT UP.
Jon: SO YOU THINK HE SHOULD BE SHOWERING WITH THE TEAM.
OH, MY GOD, YES, AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE DRYING OFF, SNEAKING UP BEHIND THEM AND PUTTING HIS WET DICK IN THEIR EAR, YOU KNOW, HETERO STYLE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE REPORT, SAM SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYBODY.
