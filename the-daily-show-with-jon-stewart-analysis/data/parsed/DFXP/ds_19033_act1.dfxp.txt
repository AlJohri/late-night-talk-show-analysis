FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT FORMER PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES HUSAIN HAQQANI IS ON THE PROGRAM. LET US BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE NEW ONGOING SERIES "THAT THING THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT DOING, THEY ARE TOTALLY DOING." [LAUGHTER] OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS OR SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING SOMETHING OF A FUN LITTLE GAME WITH THE N.S.A. THE N.S.A. TELLS US THEY ARE NOT DOING SOMETHING AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THEY ARE TOTALLY DOING IT. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR INSTANCE, --
NOBODY IS LISTENING TO YOUR TELEPHONE CALLS.
Jon: TURNS OUT THEY ARE TOTALLY LISTENING TO YOUR TELEPHONE CALLS. THEY'RE STORING THEM IN THIS GIANT UTAH FORTRESS OF SURVEILITUDE. NEXT.
WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERNET AND E-MAILS, THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO UNITED STATES CITIZENS.
Jon: GO ON.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION QUIETLY WON PERMISSION A COUPLE YEARS AGO FROM A SURVEILLANCE COURT TO HAVE THE N.S.A. SEARCH FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS OF AMERICANS INTERCEPTED PHONE CALLS AND THE LIKE.
Jon: ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, UNDER THIS PLAN, IF YOU LIKE YOUR N.S.A. SPY -- [LAUGHTER] -- YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR N.S.A. SPY SO THAT IS SOMETHING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT --
I HAD NO IDEA WE COULD KEEP OUR SAME SPY. THAT IS SHOCKING AND DELIGHTFUL. [LAUGHTER] BUT OF COURSE THE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T GET AWAY WITH DOING THINGS THAT THEY SWORE THEY WEREN'T DOING BECAUSE OF STRICTNESS OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE NOTHING THEY WEREN'T DOING.
THIS PROGRAM BY THE WAY IS FULLY OVERSEEN NOT JUST BY CONGRESS BUT BY THE FISA COURT. IT'S BEEN CARRIED OUT CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND RULE OF LAW.
Jon: SEE? IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T SO MUCH RULE OF LAW CONSISTENT AS RULE OF LAW ADJACENT. THE N.S.A. HAS BEEN ROUTINELY BREAKING PRIVACY RULES.
Jon: RULES ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN. SORRY, WAIT THAT IS PRECIOUS MOMENTS FIGURES. THOSE ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN. RULES ARE MADE TO BE FOLLOWED. EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID REPEATEDLY THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONLY USED TO CATCH BAD GUYS.
REPORTS SURFACING THAT SOME EMPLOYEES ARE TRACKING THEIR LOVE INTERESTS.
USING THE ENORMOUS POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT TO EAVESDROP ON THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS OR PEOPLE THEY WOULD LIKE TO BECOME THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HEY, I JUST MET YOU AND THIS IS CRAZY BUT HERE IS YOUR NUMBER OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AND SOCIAL SECURITY SO CALL ME OR I'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR YOUR ACTIVITIES. [LAUGHTER] I FEEL LIKE AT THIS POINT OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS PRETTY MUCH EVEN OWNING THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GETTING NEFARIOUS. LAST WEEK THE NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE LAUNCHED THIS SPY SATELLITE INTO ORBIT THE LOGO THEY CHOSE FOR THE SPY ROCKET, THIS IS REAL, A GIANT OCTOPUS SUCKING THE FACE OFF OF NORTH AMERICA. WHAT IS THAT? [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR -- [LAUGHTER] SERIOUSLY. THAT LOGO IS ONE TERRIFIED SCHOOL GIRL AWAY FROM BEING A POPULAR COMIC IN TOKYO. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, YES. I INVENTED THAT TYPE OF PORN, YES. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOOKED AT THEIR ANIME PORN AND I SAID IT'S MISSING AN OCTOPUS. [ LAUGHTER ] TODAY BROUGHT WHAT MIGHT BE THE MOST SHOCKING REVELATION YET ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE N.S.A. HAS INVADED OUR LIVES. THE N.S.A.'S ACTIVITIES DID NOT STOP WITH E-MAILS OR CELL PHONES WITH FOREIGN LEADERS. THE AGENCY ALSO SPIED ON VIDEO GAMES LIKE WORLD OF WARCRAFT AND SECOND LIFE.
Jon: ALTHOUGH WE CHOSE TO ILLUSTRATE THAT WITH UNRELATED FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS. ANYWAY WHAT POSSIBLE REASON COULD THE N.S.A. HAVE FOR THIS?
THE AGENCY FEARED THAT TERRORISTS WOULD USE THE GAMES TO PLOT ATTACKS.
Jon: I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE THEN HOW ISLAMIC TERRORISTS DO LIKE TO BE SURROUNDED BY 72 VIRGINS. BOOM! OH, YEAH! [LAUGHTER] OHOH, GAMER SLAM! [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE ON THIS STORY WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT AASIF MANDVI.
THANK YOU, JON. >WHILE I'M IN AZAROTH I HAVE TO INSIST YOU REFER TO ME AS GRAYCHALK OF DUNMORROW.
Jon: OKAY. LIKE GRAYCHALK IS YOUR WORLD OF WARCRAFT TROLL NAME I GUESS?
I'M NOT A DIRTY TROLL, JON!
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
I'M A PROUD DWARF PALLADIN.
Jon: AASIF.
GRAYCHALK.
Jon: GRAYCHALK WERE PEOPLE AWARE THAT THE N.S.A. WAS MONITORING WORLD OF WARCRAFT AND HAVE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME SEEN THE EFFECT? THERE. WERE SIGNS. TRAVEL HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY EASY IN AZAROTH, BUT NOW IT SEEMS EVERY TIME I'M TRYING TO BOARD A FLYING MOUNT I'M PULLED OUT OF THE LINE AND SEARCHED RANDOMLY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY NEVER SEARCH THE ELVES, NO.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND GRAY CHALK. ARE PEOPLE UPSET ABOUT THE N.S.A. INFILTRATE?
WE FEEL BETRAYED. THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE JOINING WORLD OF WARCRAFT AND MISREPRESENTING THEMSELVES IS UNTHINKABLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: REALLY?
YES THIS PLACE IS ALL ABOUT TRUST. IF WE THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD FALL APART. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: REALLY?
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING GRAY CHALK, SAY THAT YOU WERE STROLLING THROUGH THE AZAROTH AND YOU ENCOUNTERED AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG ELF MAIDEN.
BLOOD ELF OR NIGHT ELF.
Jon: WHO THE (bleep) KNOWS. WHICH ONE IS HOTTER?
NIGHT ELF.
Jon: SAY YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THIS NIGHT ELF AND YOU GET TO KNOW HER.
ONE TURN STAND OR ARE WE EXCHANGING RINGS OF FORGED POWER AT THE TEMPLE OF THE MOON BECAUSE IF SO I NEED ENDURANCE POINTS, AM I RIGHT? HA, HA.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S TRUE.
Jon: SAY YOU CALL THIS WOMAN IN THE REAL WORLD YOU MIGHT FIND OUT SHE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT.
WHAT?
Jon: A WOMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] OR AN ELF. YOU TAKE THAT BACK! [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GRAY CHALK?
I'M CASTING A LEVEL NINE SPELL OF HOLY WRATH ON YOU. YOU ARE NOT USING A RETRIBUTION AURA ARE YOU?
Jon: I'M NOT.
ARE YOU ON A MAC.
Jon: YES, I'M ON A MAC -- AASIF IT'S NOT REAL, NONE OF IT, THE SPELL, THE MONSTERS THE WORLD IF THE N.S.A. REVELATIONS TEACH YOU ANYTHING IT SHOULD BE THAT.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS IF THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT ISN'T REAL WHY HAVE I BEEN SPENDING EIGHT HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST 12 -- OH, MY GOD!
Jon: AASIF, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH MY LIFE, JON.
Jon: SORRY IT'S BETTER TO LEARN THIS NOW, RIGHT?
RIGHT. I DID BANK 720,000 GOLD PIECES TO HELP ME START A NEW LIFE IN THE REAL WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: REALLY?
YEAH, SO I DIDN'T WASTE MY TIME AT ALL, RIGHT.
Jon: YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL GRAYCHALK OF THE DUNMORROW!
