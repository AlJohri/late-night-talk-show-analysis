[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A FINE ACTRESS HER NEW FILM IS CALLED "OLD BOY."
APOLOGIZE FOR READING YOUR LETTERS.
YOU DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE?
NO I DIDN'T.
WHY?
I BELIEVE YOU.
WHY?
I BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE BEEN LOCKED UP FOR A LONG TIME.
WHAT IF I THOUGHT YOU KNEW TOO MUCH READING MY LETTERS? WHAT IF I FELT LIKE I NEEDED TO KILL YOU RIGHT NOW?
THEN I SUPPOSE I WOULD BE DEAD.
Jon: HOLY (bleep). PLEASE WELCOME ELIZABETH OLSEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
Jon: THIS IS AN INTENSE FILM. THIS IS INTENSE -- IT'S VERY INTENSE.
IT'S VERY INTENSE. IT'S VERY INTENSE TO TALK ABOUT. THERE'S SO MANY SECRETS.
Jon: WE WON'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT IT. BECAUSE THERE'S SPOILER ALERTS AND EVERYONE DIES. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING -- [LAUGHTER] I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT I WANT TO SAY THIS. THERE'S YOUNG ACTORS THAT PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT. [ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY.
Jon: BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY HAVE COMMON SENSE. YOU STRIKE ME AS THE ANTITHESIS OF THAT.
THAT'S NICE. MY FAMILY -- MY DAD WOULD BE REALLY PROUD ABOUT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DO YOU FEEL MORE LEVEL HEADED? IT'S THE WAY YOU MAKE CHOICES IN YOUR ROLES? THE WAY YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF. YOU WATCH SOME OF THESE YOUNGER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND THINK TO MYSELF WOW THAT IS GOING TO LOOK REALLY INTERESTING ON TMZ BUT YOU DON'T PROJECT THAT IN ANY WAY.
I HOPE NOT. I -- HONESTLY I LOVE GOING TO WORK. I REALLY LOVE BEING ON A SET I JUST FINISHED A PLAY. I LOVE DOING THAT. I LOVE THE ENSEMBLE, I LIKE THE TEAM THAT YOU CREATE. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES ALONG WITH THE JOB IS A LITTLE ODD AND I THINK PEOPLE DEAL WITH IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL -- I FEEL STABLE AND IT'S REALLY NICE TO BE AT A POINT IN WORK SO YOUNG TO FEEL THAT WAY, I THINK.
Jon: RIGHT. SEE THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. [ LAUGHTER ] AS I WAS LISTENING TO THAT WHOLE THING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, I WAS LIKE, YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE.
I HOPE SO.
Jon: WHAT IS YOUR GAME OLSEN?
PEOPLE ASK YOU WHERE DO YOU PROJECT YOU ARE GOING TO BE? WHAT ARE YOUR NEXT MOVES? I DON'T HAVE MOVES. I KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE DOING. LAST TIME IT WAS A PLAY AND I HAVE NO INTEREST IN DOING A PLAY FOR A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: THE PLAY THING SEEMS MORE EXCITING BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT AUDIENCE THERE, THE FEEDBACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH.
Jon: THAT SEEMS LIKE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF I MAY, TYPICALLY IN THEATER THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HOOTING.
NO, BUT WE DID A LOT OF EDUCATIONAL 11 A.M. MATINEES FOR MOSTLY INNER CITY SCHOOL KIDS AND IT WAS THEIR FIRST EXPERIENCE IN A THEATER AND THE MOMENT ROMEO AND JULIETTE HAD INNOCENT KISSES THERE WAS HOOTING AND HOLLERS.
Jon: HOW OLD?
7th TO 12th GRADE.
Jon: AND 7th, 8th GRADE YOU GET HOOTING AND HOLLERING.
AN ACTOR ENTERED WITHOUT A SHIRT ON BECAUSE HE IS A FIRE FIGHTER.
Jon: HE IS BUILT.
THAT ALWAYS GOT A NICE LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT BUT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I BELIEVE THAT WAS IT. THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO FUN. IT WAS SO ALIVE.
Jon: IT'S EXCITING. AVENGERS IS COMING, YES?
YES.
Jon: AND YOU ARE SCARLET WITCH?
I AM.
Jon: ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS.
REALLY?
Jon: I HAVE A NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY SO DON'T THINK THIS IS TOO WEIRD.
I HAVE A 29-YEAR-OLD BROTHER AND I DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD.
Jon: IS HE STILL INTO IT?
EVERY WEEK.
Jon: AND THE TWIN BROTHER QUICKSILVER IS HE IN THIS AS WELL? WHO IS QUICKSILVER, DO THEY KNOW YET?
AARON TAYLOR JOHNSON BUT I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE FROM MARVEL ARE GOING TO MASK ME FOR TALKING TOO MUCH.
Jon: DOES THAT HAPPEN?
SAMUEL JACKSON COULD WALK RIGHT IN WHO IS ALSO IN OLDBOY.
Jon: IS THERE A RULE HE HAS TO BE IN EVERYTHING?
I THINK HE HAS BEEN IN ALMOST EVERY SPIKE LEE MOVIE.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
HE HAS BEEN IN A LOT OF SPIKE'S MOVIES.
Jon: HOW MUCH BASKETBALL TALK GOES ON BEHIND THE SET.
AND GAMES PLANNED WHEN THE KNICKS WERE VISITING.
Jon: DID ANY OF THE KNICKS VISIT THE SET AS WELL AND SIT ON HIS SIDELINE AND YELL (bleep) TO HIM?
NO.
Jon: THEY DON'T?
NO, MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT WATCHING A KNICKS GAME IS WATCHING THE BACK OF SPIKE.
Jon: HE GOES CRAZY.
HE COACHES. HE'S A DIRECTOR. I'M AN ATHLETE. I GREW UP PLAYING VOLLEYBALL. I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTNESS OF HIS DIRECTING. THERE'S NOTHING. HE DOESN'T TRY TO DANCE AROUND THE ISSUE. HE'S A COACH. HE JUST TELLS YOU WHAT HE NEEDS. I LOVE THAT WAY.
Jon: IS IT BRUISING EVER? DO YOU FIND YOURSELF FEELING -- CAN IT BE HURTFUL OR IS IT SOMETHING YOU NEED?
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING I LIKE AS AN ACTOR. MY BUDDY SEAN DIRKEN WHO MY DIRECTED MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE. HE WOULD SAY I JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU. WE'LL GO BACK AND DO IT AGAIN.
I APPRECIATEI THAT. I'M LIKE YEAH I KNOW I'M LYING.
Jon: YOU FEEL THE DIFFERENCE. YOU ARE NOT? THE SWEET SPOT?
I TOTALLY FEEL LIKE I'M NOT TELLING TRUTH AT ALL. I APPRECIATE THAT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS  ACTING I ALSO --  FELT THAT I WAS LYING BUT MOSTLY TO MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M EXCITED. ALL GOOD THINGS FOR YOU. "OLDBOY" IS IN THE THEATERS ON NOVEMBER 27. ALL THE BLOCKBUSTERS COMING OUT. ELIZABETH OLSEN, EVERYBODY.
