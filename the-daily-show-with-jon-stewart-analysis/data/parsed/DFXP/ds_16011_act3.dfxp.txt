( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT AN AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED, "PUNCHING OUT:  ONE YEAR IN A CLOSING AUTO PLANT." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, PAUL CLEMENS. "PUNCHING OUT." I JUST WANT TO SAY, THANKS FOR WRITING THIS. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE STORIES THAT I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HEAR WERE NOT FOR THE  DILIGENCE AND PATIENCE AND OBSERVANCE OF A JOURNALIST SUCH AS YOURSELF WHO GOES IN THERE. YOU SPENT A YEAR WATCHING SOME GENTLEMEN IN MICHIGAN PACK UP A STAMPING PLANT.
YES. FOR ABOUT 11 MONTHS, I WENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD TO THE BUD PLANT, WHICH IS ON THE EAST SIDE  OF DETROIT. IT WAS BUILT IN 1919. A RICH HISTORY. ITS CLAIM TO FAME WAS IN THE 19 FICHTs IT STAMPED AND ASSEMBLED THE BODY OF THE FORD  THUNDERBIRD, AS ICONIC A CAR AS DETROIT PRODUCED IN THE 20th CENTURY. WHEN I SAW THAT THE PLANT WAS CLOSING IN 2006, I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE A NICE WAY TO GET INTO  THE TOPIC I WANTED TO WRITE ABOUT, BLUE COLLAR DECLINE AND UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEMS AND SO ON.
Jon:  WHICH MAKES SENSE. YOU HEARD ABOUT IT FROM A NEWS LETTER CALLED "PLANT CLOSING NEWS."
THAT'S THE OPENING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK, THE PROLOGUE, AND  THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KIND OF DISCOVERED AS I WAS WORKING ON THE BOOK THAT TAKING  APART INDUSTRY IS SORT OF ITS OWN INDUSTRY. TRUCKING FIRMS, DEMOLITION COMPANIES, SCRAP COMPANIES, THEY ALL GET INVOLVED IN PLANT CLOSINGS. AND, YEAH, THERE'S AN INDUSTRY NOW THAT TAKES APART INDUSTRY. THAT'S SORT OF WHERE WE ARE.
Jon:  AND IN SOME RESPECTS, HAS SUPPLANTED ACTUAL INDUSTRY IN DETROIT. IT IS A THRIVING-- THESE ARE GENTLEMEN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING THE LINE.
YEAH, THAT'S ONE OF THE SAD THINGS. THE BOOK HAS ITS HUMOR, BUT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A SAD STORY. AND IT'S THE SAME SKILL SET. , YOU KNOW, IT'S THE SAME SORT OF MUSCLE MEMORY THAT USED TO BE GOING TO MAKING THINGS CAN NOW  BE APPLIED-- DETROIT IS STILL PRODUCING CARS AND WILL CONTINUE, BUT IN PART, THAT'S  THE SKILL SET USED TO TAKE APART THE EQUIPMENT THAT USED TO MAKE THE CARS.
Jon:  THE CRAZIEST THING TO ME IT'S LOCATED BETWEEN TWO CHRYSLER PLANT.
THAT'S CORRECT.
Jon:  AND THESE GUYS WHO ALL SEEM TO HAVE GREAT REVERENCE FOR THE COUPLE-- THE PLANT WAS  NOT FUNCTIONING. THIS IS A YEAR YOU SPENT WITH THEM AS IT'S DISASSEMBLING.
AFTER IT CLOSED, CORRECT.
Jon:  WHERE DID THEY SEND THE PLANT ONCE THEY DISASSEMBLED IT?
WELL, A LOT OF SCRAP STEEL WENT ABROAD. ONE OF THE LINES, STAMPING LINE IN THE PLANT --
LINE 16.
YEAH, THAT ONE WENT TO CENTRAL MEXICO. AND ANOTHER LINE WENT TO BRAZIL. IT WAS A REALLY DIVERSE CAST OF CHARACTERS. PORTUGUESE, SPANISH, GERMAN ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN THE PLANT. THAT'S-- THOSE ARE THE COUNTRIES-- BRAZIL AND MEXICO --
THE INTERESTING THING AND WHO-- WHAT COMPANY BOUGHT THE MATERIALS TO REASSEMBLE IT IN MEXICO?
A SPANISH COMPANY NAMED GURKS, STAMP BUT THEY ARE MAKING PARTS FOR THE DODGE JOURNEY, A  CHRYSLER CAR. YOU MOVED A LINE THAT WAS IN A PLANT BETWEEN TWO CHRYSLER PLANT 1800 MILES SOUTHWEST TO PRODUCE  A CHRYSLER CAR.
Jon:  THIS IS THE POINT I WAS GETTING TO. ( LAUGHTER ) HOW ARE WE GOING TO COMPETE WHEN THE COMPANY THAT IS RIGHT THERE  BELIEVES IT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO LITERALLY PICK UP SOMETHING, AND IT TAKES THEM A  YEAR TO UNBOLT IT FROM WHERE IT WAS, AND MOVE IT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY? HOW DO WE IN AND WAY BATTLE THAT KIND OF--
THAT'S WHY THE BOOK IS CALLED "ONE YEAR IN A CLOSING AUTO PLANT."  THE BOOK DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A THESIS BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER. IT'S DESCRIPTIVE. AND IT JUST STARTS TO LAY OUT THE PROCESS. I HADN'T SEEN ANYONE DESCRIBE IT AND I TRIED TO DESCRIBE IT AS BEST I COULD. I WISH I HAD A THESIS. WHEN I FINISHED IT MY EDITOR SAID,"THIS IS KIND OF A WEIRD BOOK."
Jon:  A GOOD THING TO HEAR FROM YOUR EDITOR.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. AND I THINK WHAT HE MEANT AND HE WAS RIGHT, THERE WASN'T SOMETHING I WAS TRYING TO PROVE. IT WASN'T HOW UNION GREED RUINED AMERICA OR HOW NASA RUINED EVERYTHING. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  ARE YOU-- ARE YOU GOING TO BE USING ANY OF THOSE TITLE OR IS THAT NOW UP FOR GRABS?
YOU CAN HAVE THEM.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT.
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OPINIONS, AND HONESTLY, I DON'T  REALLY KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO ARTICULATE A GOOD ARGUMENT. I JUST WANTED TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENS-- WE SEE HEADLINES ALL  THE TIME-- "PLANT TO CLOSE." AND IT'S NOT JUST DETROIT OR  AUTO OR THE UPPER MIDWEST OR MICHIGAN. IT'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE SITING IS DETROIT AND AUTO BUT IT'S NOT THE SUBJECT. THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOK IS BLUE COLLAR DECLINE AND HOW WE GOT WHERE WE ARE.
Jon:  THE HEART OF THE BOOK REALLY IS THESE CHARACTERS THAT YOU SPEND YOUR TIME WITH  AND THE ARKANSAS BOYS AND THIS GUY NEDRAS FROM BOSNIA. THE INTERESTING THING I THOUGHT IN THE BOOK WAS THIS DELINEATION OF BLUE COLLAR WORKERS, PROUNION  AND ANTIUNION, WHO COME FROM THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS, SAME WORK ETHIC, GO TO THE SAME CHURCH, HAVE THE SAME SORT OF POLITICAL BELIEFS, JUST ON ALMOST OPPOSITE SIDE.
YEAH. BUT I THINK THE PRIDE, THE WORKING CLASS AND BLUE COLLAR PRIDE IN THE-- THAT JOINS PEOPLE  PEOPLE. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF GUYS FROM THE BOOK. THERE'S ONE MOVING PASSAGE WHERE A GUY TALKS ABOUT THE CARE HE WANTED TO TAKE IN TAKING APART  THE PRESS LINES THAT HAD SUPPORTED NILD-CLASS AMERICAN FAMILIES FOR YEARS, AND HE HOPED  IT WOULD DO THE SAME FOR MEXICAN FAMILIES AND I FOUND THAT A REALLY MOVING MONOLOGUE WHEN I  HEARD IT, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THE BOOK.
Jon:  IT'S A TERRIFIC BOOK AND FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN ASPECT  OF THIS PROSPECT, OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND, YOU HAVE TO PICK IT UP. "PUNCHING OUT." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES
