FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME! -- WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER TONIGHT. TONIGHT WE HAVE WITH US THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND, MR. BILLY CRYSTAL IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FUNNY MAN, FUNNY MAN! WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. FOR YEARS NOW SYRIA HAS INSISTED THAT NOT ONLY HAS IT NOT USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS--  (LAUGHTER) -- WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT? (LAUGHTER) SO AFTER A RECENT CHEMICAL WEAPONS INCIDENT IN SYRIA THE UNITED STATES DECIDED TO SEE IF WE COULD BOMB THE TRUTH OUT OF THEM. (LAUGHTER) SOMEWHERE ON THE WAY TO THE MUNITIONS DEPOT THE PLAN HIT A SNAG. RUSSIA SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS IF SYRIA WERE TO GIVE UP THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS IT DOES NOT HAVE, AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT.
THE U.N. HAS CONFIRMED TO US THAT THE SYRIAN MISSION HERE HAS SENT TO THEM A LETTER IN WHICH THEY ASK TO ACCEDE TO JOIN THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION OF 1993. THE TERMS OF THAT BASICALLY SAY A COUNTRY HAS TO GET RID OF ALL ITS STOCKPILES OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
Jon: OH, OH, YOU SAID SARIN -- SARIN GAS, OH, YEAH, WE HAVE THAT. (LAUGHTER) WE THOUGHT YOU SAID GIVE UP YOUR STOCKPILES OF SARAN WRAP. (LAUGHTER) WE DON'T HAVE THAT, WE'RE A TUPPERWARE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) NOW WHILE THIS DEVELOPMENT PUTS A CRIMP IN WHAT HAS BEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S PUSH TO RALLY THE NATION BEHIND ONE OF THOSE NOT WARS WE LIKE TO ENGAGE IN FROM TIME TO TIME--  (LAUGHTER) THE PRESIDENT STILL ON TUESDAY NIGHT INTERRUPTED THE PRIME TIME SCHEDULES OF EVERY MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORK TO WALK DOWN I KILLED BIN LADEN LANE--  (LAUGHTER) AND MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICAN INTERVENTION IN SYRIA! BECAUSE GOING AHEAD AND MAKING THE SPEECH EVEN AFTER THE RUSSIANS MADE THAT OFFER, AND THE SYRIANS ACCEPTED IT, WAS THE BEST THING TO DO. NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD PUT A DEPOSIT DOWN ON THAT TIME--  (LAUGHTER) BEFORE MOMENTUM SWUNG TO A MORE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION. AND APPARENTLY THEY CAN'T GET THEIR MONEY BACK. (LAUGHTER) THE HEART OF THE PRESIDENT'S ARGUMENT WAS SIMPLE.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, FOR NEARLY SEVEN DECADES THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE ANCHOR OF GLOBAL SECURITY THIS HAS MEANT DOING MORE THAN FORGING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. IT HAS MEANT ENFORCING THEM. THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA DIFFERENT, THAT'S WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL.
Jon: WELL-- NO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT AND OUR SCULPTURES OF ELVIS PRESLEY MADE OUT OF BUTTER. THAT'S SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOT A LOT OF COUNTRIES HAVE. (LAUGHTER) ELVIS. THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS VIOLATED INTERNATIONAL NORMS. INDEED IF THERE IS ONE THING PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR ABOUT IT IS THAT VIOLATIONS OF HALLOWED INTERNATIONAL LAW LIKE THE GENEVA PROTOCOLS MUST BE PUNISHED WHETHER IT BE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS OR TORTURE.
WILL YOU APPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO INDEPENDENTLY INVESTIGATE THE GRAVEST CRIMES OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING TORTURE AND WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW.
Jon: SEE THAT EVEN YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPER OBAMA WOULDN'T EVEN LET THAT GO. NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW AND I'M SURE THAT THAT CLIP DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE ON IT.
ON THE OTHER HAND--  (LAUGHTER)
GO ON.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I ALSO HAVE A BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO LOOK FORWARD AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING BACKWARDS.
Jon: I MEAN IF LOOKING BACKWARDS HAD ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER, CARS WOULD HAVE REARVIEW MIRRORS. (LAUGHTER) BUT THEY-- LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING ENHANCED INTERROGATION IS THE SAME AS GASSING YOUR OWN PEOPLE. ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IT IS TOUGH TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO WAR TO ALWAYS UPHELD INTERNATIONALLY AGREED UPON NORMS SO SOON AS WHEN WE OURSELVES PLAYED A GET OUT OF INTERNATIONAL NORMS FREE CARD. BUT IF THE SYRIAN CRISIS DOES END, AND BY THE WAY, THAT'S THE CARD THAT I NEVER SAW IN THE MONOPOLY GAME, THAT WOULD HAVE-- WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN A NICE THING TO BUILD UP ON THAT. IF THE SYRIAN CRISIS DOES END IN A DIPLOMATIC RESOLUTION INSTEAD OF THE BOOMY KIND, AT LEAST PARTIAL CREDIT HAS GOT TO GO TO RUSSIAN PRESIDENT AND SHIRT ALLERGY SURVIVOR--  (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MR. VLADIMIR PUTIN.
PUTIN HAS EMERGED AS THE SORT OF PEACEMAKER IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS. AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS CAUTIOUSLY BACKED HIS PROPOSAL FOR SYRIA TO SURRENDER THEIR CHEMICAL WEAPON STOCKPILES TO INTERNATIONAL CONTROL.
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CAUTION. THE PHRASE RUSSIAN PEACE PROPOSAL IS NOT A FAMILIAR ONE. I MEAN IF YOU RUN A SEARCH ON IT, GOOGLE ASSUMES YOU MISSPELLED IT. (LAUGHTER) BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WHAT'S THE HARM IN GIVING THIS PLAN A GO?
NO MATTER HOW YOU SPIN THIS IT APPEARS THAT PUTIN REALLY IS KIND OF PULLING THE STRINGS.
PUTIN LOOKS LIKE HE'S WINNING THE DAY.
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS PRETTY MUCH OUTPLAYED PRESIDENT OBAMA IF I CAN USE AN OLD SOUTHERN TERM, LIKE A BROKEN BANJO.
PUTIN FRANKLY WALKED ALL OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA.
TOSSING OBAMA AROUND, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY, LIKE A RAG DOLL.
PUTIN ENJOYS BEATING ON OBAMA AND OBAMA WILL ALWAYS GIVE UP THE LUNCH MONEY.
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS MAY SOUND EXTREME BUT SORT OF CASTRATED THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: OH MY GOD! WE HAVE HAD OUR BALLS CUT OFF? ! AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE LUNCH MONEY! (LAUGHTER) OH NO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT DOES EVERYBODY OVER AT FOX SO UPSET ABOUT. APPARENTLY IT WAS YOUR BOSS'S IDEA A YEAR AGO.
THIS IS FROM ABOUT A YEAR AGO, MR. AILES SAYS QUOTE PUTIN IS ANGRY, HE THINKS THE UNITED STATES DOESN'T TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY OR TREAT RUSSIA AS A MAJOR PLAYER. IF I WERE PRESIDENT, I WOULD GET IN A ROOM WITH HIM AND SAY LOOK, LOOK AT THE SLAUGHTER GOING ON IN SYRIA. YOU CAN STOP IT. DO IT AND I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOU GET ALL THE CREDIT.
Jon: BUT THAT WOULD MAKE AMERICA LOOK WEAK, YOU'LL HAVE OUR TESTICLES IN A JAR, WE WON'T-- WE WON'T HAVE ANY LUNCH MONEY. DOESN'T THAT COST US?
EVERYBODY NEEDS DIGNITY AND WHAT DOES IT COST? YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT, AND YOU GIVE UP NOTHING.
Jon: EXACTLY! AILES KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. AND IF ANYBODY KNOWS HOW TO PROFITABLY NEGOTIATE WITH EGO MANIACAL SOCIOPATHS--  (LAUGHTER) IT'S ROGER AILES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU, HOWEVER, THAT WAS-- I WILL GIVE YOU THAT. THAT WAS A PRETTY LOW ONE RIGHT THERE. YOU KNOW, JUST GETTING BACK, I'M STILL DISORIENTED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. SURE, PUT THE PICTURES UP, I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER) WHY SO SERIOUS? (LAUGHTER) I'LL TELL YOU, HOWEVER IT CAME ABOUT, IT SEEMS VLADIMIR PUTIN SAVED THE DAY HERE A LITTLE BIT. AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T ARROGANTLY AND PUBLICALLY SHOVE THAT IN OUR FACES I THINK THIS FRAGILE NEW ARRANGEMENT COULD WORK.
THIS MORNING RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN IS CRITICIZING U.S. POLICY IN AN OP ED IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES". SAYING U.S. MILITARY ACTION IN SYRIA WOULD HURT CIVILIANS AND SPREAD CONFLICT.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, "NEW YORK TIMES", THAT'S HOW YOU REACH OUT TO AMERICANS? (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH BUZZFEED OR-- MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW-- DUCK DYNASTY. I DON'T KNOW, RIGHT THERE SECOND OF ALL WHY ARE YOU [BLEEP] ON US IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES". JUST MOMENTS AFTER WE SALUTED YOUR STATESMANSHIP? YOU HAD TO SAY ONE MORE THING. YOU'RE LIKE THE LARRY DAVID OF INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY. (LAUGHTER) BUT LOOK, REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON SYRIA. VLADIMIR PUTIN IS ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION ON OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY.
BUT NOW PUTIN IS TAKING AIM AT OBAMA'S CLAIMS THAT AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONAL NATION.
Jon: OH NO YOU DID NOT. (LAUGHTER) WHAT PART OF BUTTER ELVIS DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? (LAUGHTER)
STATING IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SEE THEMSELVES AS EXCEPTIONAL, WHATEVER THE MOTIVATION. WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT, BUT WHEN WE ASK FOR THE LORD'S BLESSINGS, WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT GOD CREATED US EQUAL.
Jon: [BLEEP] IS THAT? WHEN DID VLADIMIR PUTIN START WATCHING OPRAH? WHAT THE HELL? AND BY THE WAY, VLADIMIR, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE BEST GUY TO PLAY THE EQUALITY CARD. WE ARE ALL TOGETHER, BEAUTIFUL COLORS IN A RAINBOW, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T WAVE THAT RAINBOW AS A FLAG. THIS IS IT. YOU WANT US TO GO ROCKY IV ON YOUR ASS? BECAUSE YEAH, OKAY, YOU MIGHT HAVE THE SUPERIOR TRAINING, FACILITIES. YOU MIGHT HAVE THE SUPERIOR BODY TYPES BUT YOU PICKED A FIGHT IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" OP ED PAGE. SO GUESS WHO YOU'RE STEPPING IN THE RING WITH. GET READY FOR THE EXPOUNDABLES, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU MAY TAKE DOWN KRUGMAN BUT DOWD WILL BE RIGHT BEHIND HIM WITH A CUTTING AND UNFAVORABLE COMPARISON WITH YOU AN LET'S SAY McDREAMY FROM GRAY'S ANATOMY. SHE GOES DOWN YOU STILL HAVE TO CONTEND WITH KRISTOF, FREIDMAN OR DOUTHAT, DOD-- BROOKS, BROOKS-- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
