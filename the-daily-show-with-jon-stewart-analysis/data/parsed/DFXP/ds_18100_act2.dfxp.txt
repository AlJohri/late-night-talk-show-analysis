Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IT WAS  SOLZHENITSYN WITHOUT ONCE  SAID I BELIEVE THE CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE, TEACH THEM  WELL AND LET THEM LEAD THE  WAY, OR SOMEBODY SAID THAT. BUT WHAT SHOULD WE TEACH  THEM AND WHERE SHOULD WE  LEAD THEM. AASIF MANDVI INVESTIGATES.
Reporter: YOUNG PEOPLE  TODAY ARE UNDER HE FOR HOUSE  PRESSURE AND IT'S EASIER THAN EVER FOR THEM TO SLIP  OFF THE RAILS. IN THE '70s THE SCARED  STRAIGHT PROGRAM TRIED TO  SAVE TROUBLED TEENS BY  PUTTING THEM FACE-TO-FACE WITH HARDENED CRIMINALS. TODAY'S AT-RISK YOUTH NEED A  NEW SCARED STRAIGHT.
I HAVE ONE PERSON THAT I  WANT TO YOU MEET. THIS GUY IS GOING TO MELT  YOUR BRAIN.
Reporter: PJ, GET IN HERE.
HOW RAO DOING? OPINIONS OKAY, HE MAY NOT  LOOK SCARY. BUT WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR HIS  STORY.
I SCREWED MY LIFE UP  GOING TO COLLEGE. A PRIVATE INSTITUTION. DIDN'T RESEARCH, DIDN'T  THINK WHEN I TOOK LOANS OUT. I OWE $170,000. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
Reporter: YES, PJ WAS  HERE TO SCARE KIDS WHO WERE  AT-RISK OF A COLLEGE  EDUCATION. COST ARE UP OVER $1,000  PERCENT IN THE LAST 30 YEAR,  STUDENT DEBT AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND JOB PROSPECTS ARE  DISMAL. CAREER ADVISOR MARTY THEMCO.
FOR MANY MORE PEOPLE THAN  IN DECADES PAST, COLLEGE IS  THE WRONG CHOICE. THOSE WHO ARE AVERAGE  STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL, WHO  WENT INTO COLLEGE, THEY END  UP DOING JOBS THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE STRAIGHT OUT  OF HIGH SCHOOL LIKE SELLING  EXTENDED WARRANTIES. OR THEY ARE BARTENDERS.
I HAVE A STUDENT THAT  THEY HAD A BARTENDING MAJOR.
I THINK THAT IS CALLED  ENGLISH LITERATURE.
Reporter: YEAH, ENGLISH  LIT, NICE! WHOOO! SO HAD OUR GIVEN THESE  ISSUES THOUGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO MAJ  NEVER HNS.
HISTORY.
SOCIALIOLOGY.
JOURNALISM.
WOW, DO SU HAVE A TIME  MACHINE? BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED  ONE TO GO BACK IN TIME TO  WHEN PEOPLE GIVE [BLEEP] ABOUT JOURNALISM DEGREES.
LOOKS LIKE THESE KIDS  NEED A PJ TO PUT THE FEAR OF  SCHOOL IN THEM.
I ADD GRA YATED WITH A  DEGREE IN IL STRACHLINGTS I  DON'T EVEN DO ART AT ALL. $170,000. THAT'S A HOUSE.
ILLUSTRATION IS AN  ECONOMICALLY USELESS DEGREE. I WILL BE DEAD BEFORE THESE  LOANS ARE PAID OFF. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKES I  DID.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
WHAT DID YOU FEEL LIKE  YOU GOT OUT OF THAT.
IT'S CLEAR I SHOULDN'T DO  ANYTHING WITH ILLUSTRATION. THAT SEEMS LIKE A BAD LIFE  CHOICE.
THAT IS YOUR TAKE-AWAY  FROM IT YOU ARE GETTING A  PHOTOGRAPHY DEGREE.
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS,  RIGHT?
IDIOTS. MAYBE WHAT THESE KIDS NEED  IS SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP.
LOOK RIGHT INTO THAT  CAMERA. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE  TO A TEENAGER WHO IS  THINKING ABOUT GOING TO  COLLEGE RIGHT NOW.
THINK FREE TIME, GIVE  EQUAL VALUE TO  APPRENTICESHIPS, TAKING A  BREAK FROM SCHOOL --
I'M SORRY, COULD YOU JAZZ  IT UP, YOU ARE TALKING TO  TEENAGERS.
HEY, DUDE, YOU KNOW THE  COLLEGE THING, THERE'S  SOMETHING UP WITH THAT, BUT IS THAT THE WHOLE DEAL? I'M NOT SO SURE. YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THE  OPTIONS. THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW,  APPRENTICESHIPS. THERE ARE OPTIONS, DUDE OR  DUDETTE. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO BE  HONEST, YOU ARE KIND OF  AWESOME AT THAT.
THAT'S WHY I DO THE WORK  I DO, I LOVE IT.
Reporter: THIS TIME  MISSION DEFINITELY  ACCOMPLISHED.
THERE ARE OPTIONS, DUDE  OR DUDETTE.
SO WHO'S STILL GOING TO  COLLEGE?
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? TIME TO GIVE THIS JOB TO  GUYS WHO NEVER WENT TO  COLLEGE. GUYS WITH REAL SKILL.
DUDETTE, GET IN HERE.
WHAT'S UP.
WHY YOU SMILING IT? GET YOUR ASS UP HERE. I'LL BREAK YOUR LIPS OFF.
I'M GOING TO DROP A BOMB  ON YOU. IF YOU HATE GOING TO SCHOOL,  COLLEGE IS A LOT LIKE  SCHOOL.
STUDENT LOANS ARE LIKE  HERPES WITH COMPOUND  INTEREST.
YOU MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE,  YOU WILL HAVE TO MOVE BACK  HOME WITH MOMMA, BOY. IF YOU WANT TO BE  INTERESTING AT PARTIES,  THREE WORD, MALCOLM [BLEEP] GLADWELL.
YOU GOT A COLLEGE DEGREE  IN THIS HAND, IT'S DAY LET  PAPER IN THIS HAND.
YOU CA TAKE [BLEEP].
AFTER TWO HOURS OF  ENHANCED EDUCATION  TECHNIQUES I WAS HOPEFUL  THESE KIDS WOULD FINALLY MAKE A SMARTER CHOICE THAN  GOING COLLEGE.
MAYBE NOW I WANT TO  INTERN AT A RECORDING STUDIO  OR SOMEWHERE ELSEWHERE I CAN GET SOME FIRSTHAND, HANDS-ON  EXPERIENCE.
NICE, THAT WAS ALL WORTH  IT TO HAVE HELPED EVEN ONE  YOUNG PERSON TO STAY OUT OF  SCHOOL. AND ONE MORE THING, LEARN  CHINESE. IT WILL HELP.
