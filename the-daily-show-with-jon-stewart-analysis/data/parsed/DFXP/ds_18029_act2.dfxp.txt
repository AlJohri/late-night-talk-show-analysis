(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! THE 2012 ELECTIONS -- 2012  ELECTIONS ARE OVER, BUT WHAT  HAPPENS TO THE TRUE HEROES OF OUR POLITICAL PROCESS HE? NOW THAT THE SPOTLIGHT HAS MOVED  ON, JASON JONES HAS MORE.
THE U.S. ELECTIONS ARE OVER.
BARACK OBAMA WILL BE  REELECTED --
BUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT FOR THE  PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE THE TRUE  BACKBONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY? AMERICAN POLITICAL CONSULTANTS. NOT ALL OF THEM WORK AS CABLE  NEWS PUNDITS. SOME FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PATH.
PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WORK  PRINCIPALLY ON CAMPAIGNS LOOK  ELSEWHERE, OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, CAMPAIGNS IN OTHER  COUNTRIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
TONIGHT WE HEAR THE STORY OF  THESE AMERICAN STRATEGISTS WHO  CROSS THE GLOBE HELPING LESS FORTUNATE DEMOCRACIES. THEY ARE CONSULTANTS WITHOUT  BORDERS. ♪ A HERO COULD SAVE US -- ♪
LISTEN, EVERY PLACE IS NOT  LIKE, YOU KNOW, OUR COUNTRY IN  TERMS OF THE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY. U.S. POLITICAL CONSULTANTS JUST  HAVE A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE.
AND THAT EXPERIENCE CAN MAKE  ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR NATIONS  IN NEED.
WELL, IN IRELAND, FOR  EXAMPLE, THE INCUMBENT  GOVERNMENT HAD A WEB SITE AND THE WEB SITE HAD A LINK TO  "PLAYBOY" AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS  THAT THE MINISTER WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT DEPARTMENT'S NAME  WAS PAT RABBIT. SO WE SHARED THAT INFORMATION. IT MADE FOR A GREAT HEADLINE,  "RABBIT'S BUNNIES."  (LAUGHS)  WHICH WAS PERFECT! (LAUGHTER)
JUST TO THINK, THAT  MEANINGLESS TITTY SCANDAL MIGHT  HAVE GONE UNUTILIZED.
IT MIGHT HAVE GONE UNNOTICED  BUT FOR MY SMALL CONTRIBUTION.
THEY SAY GIVE A MAN A SMEAR  AND HE'LL WIN A CAMPAIGN, BUT  TEACH A MAN TO SPEAR AND HE'LL WIN FOR A LIFETIME. SO AMERICAN CONSULTANTS ARE ALSO  TRAINING THEIR FOREIGN  COUNTERPARTS AT CONFERENCES LIKE  THIS.
IN AUSTRIA WE -- THE  CONSULTANTS SOMETIMES HAVE TOO  MUCH RESPECT AND THE AMERICAN CONSULTANTS COME IN AND HAVE NO  RESPECT.
HOW GREAT IT IS TO HAVE THAT  KNOWLEDGE NOW?
I FEEL INSPIRED.
THOSE AMERICANS HELP YOU WIN.
YES.
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GIFT THAT  IS TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE.
YES, YES, OF COURSE.
I KNOW YOU'RE RUSSIAN AND NOT  USED TO EXPRESSING JOY, BUT CAN  YOU SHOW A LITTLE JOY?
YES. YES. YES. YES. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY, I'LL TAKE THAT. OF COURSE, ALL OF THIS IS TO  BENEFIT THE CITIZENS OF THESE  EMERGING DEMOCRACIES. THE PEOPLE OF BOLIVIA, THE  UKRAINE AND HONDURAS COULDN'T BE  MORE THANKFUL. I'M LOOKING AT YOUR FACES AND  JUST SEEING HOW GRATEFUL YOU ALL  ARE. (LAUGHTER)
WE DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT.
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
NO, IT'S NOT A GOOD THING. THE AMERICAN POLITICAL  CONSULTANTS CAME IN TO DO A FULL  OVERHAUL OF HIS IMAGE AFTER HE SHOULD RIGHTLY HAVE BEEN PUT TO  JAIL. SO THEY CAME UP WITH HIM SMILING  ON POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND  THERE WERE SIMPLE SLOGANS "I'M LISTENING."
THAT'S GREAT!
NO, NOT REALLY. HE THREW HIS OPPONENTS IN JAIL.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T  LISTENING. PROBABLY HEARD SOMETHING HE  DIDN'T LIKE AND THREW THEM IN  JAIL.
NOT REALLY HELPING DEMOCRACY.
HE WON. OUR SYSTEM WORKS.
JUST BECAUSE IT WORKS DOESN'T  MEAN THAT IT'S NECESSARILY  RIGHT. A PERFECT EXAMPLE WAS GONZALEZ  POSADA. HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT AND  THAT WAS A DISASTER.
DISASTER MUST BE THE SPANISH  WORD FOR SUCCESS BECAUSE TAD  DEVINE HAD BEEN IN BOLIVIA WORKING ON THAT EXACT CAMPAIGN.
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT  CAMPAIGN. OUR PRINCIPAL OPPONENT HAD TWO  THINGS GOING FOR HIM: NUMBER  ONE, HE HAD A TREMENDOUS  MUSTACHE. (LAUGHTER)  HE ALSO HAD AN INCREDIBLE LAMA  AD. HE HAD AN AD WITH HIM AND A  LAMA. BUT OUR CANDIDATE WOUND UP  WINNING ELECTIONS.
THAT'S TERRIFIC.
WELL, YES, HE GOT ELECTED BUT  THE RESULTS FOR THE COUNTRY WERE  AWFUL.
WHAT DOES THIS BOLIVIAN GUY  KNOW ABOUT BOLIVIA?
LISTEN, IT'S VERY COMPLICATED  THERE AND UNFORTUNATELY AFTER HE  WAS ELECTED THERE WAS INSURRECTION IN THE STREETS. RIOTS AND ULTIMATELY HE WAS  FORCED TO RESIGN.
AMERICAN STYLE DEMOCRACY  UNDONE BY THE WILL OF THE LOCAL  PEOPLE. (SIGHS)
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT  SITUATION.
HOW DID YOU PICK YOURSELF UP?
I WENT ON TO THE NEXT  CAMPAIGN.
GOD BLESS YOU, SIR. AND THEIR PERSEVERANCE IS  RIVALED ONLY BY THEIR  GENEROSITY.
IT'S BEEN GREAT TO TRAVEL TO  THESE PLACES, TO WORK WITH  PEOPLE.
AND TO DO ALL THIS WITHOUT  GETTING PAID IS JUST INCREDIBLE.
WELL, I GET PAID FOR IT.
YES, BUT LESS THAN YOU DO  HERE.
I SOMETIMES GET PAID LESS AND  SOMETIMES I GET PAID MORE.
WELL, FINANCIAL COMPENSATION  DOESN'T DIMINISH THE VOLUNTEER  SPIRIT.
WELL, IT'S SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS  THE WORK AND IS HAPPY TO HAVE  THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT.
A HERO.
I'LL JUST POLITICAL  CONSULTANT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR  ME.
THEY SAY THAT A HERO CAN SAVE  US. AND LUCKY FOR THE REST OF THE  WORLD WE HAVE PLENTY OF THOSE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: JASON JONES. WE'LL BE RIGHT
