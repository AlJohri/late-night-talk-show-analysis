Jon: ♪  WITH MALICE. PLEASE WELCOME ANNA KENDRICK. COME ON. NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU! THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: YOUNG -- LET ME TELL YOU THIS.
YES.
Jon: AND I SAY THIS TO YOU, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
THAT'S VERY SWEET.
Jon: IT'S WHAT I DO.
YOU KNOW, JUST ON BEING, JUST ON BEING HERE? LIVING LIFE?
Jon: NO, CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS FILM, THIS "INTO THE WOODS," THE "PITCH PERFECT," THE ONLY THING I WONDER IS ARE YOU CONCERNED, AT ALL.
YEAH.
Jon: WITH BEING TYPE CAST AS A HUGELY TALENTED MULTIDIMENSIONAL STAR? AND BECAUSE OF THAT, SHOULDN'T YOU SUCK IN SOMETHING?
I SUCK --
Jon: TO TRY AND --
I SUCK AT PLENTY OF STUFF.
Jon: OH, STOP IT!
OH YEAH.
Jon: STOP IT! I WON'T HAVE THAT TALK FROM YOU.
I CAN'T COOK, I'M TERRIBLE AT MATH. YOU KNOW, THERE'S TONS OF STUFF I'M BAD AT.
Jon: NOW, THE COOKING THING IS INTERESTING --
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE IS IT SOMETHING YOU DON'T CARE TO DO, OR IS IT --
I WANT TO LEARN. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN BUT I DO WANT TO LEARN.
Jon: THERE IS A PLACE IN BETWEEN --
WHERE IT'S JUST BAD?
jon: BEING AN OKAY COOK AND NOT DESTROYING YOUR HOUSE.
OKAY. THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
Jon: EXACTLY.
FINGERS CROSSED, YEAH.
Jon: I KNOW. DID YOU-- THE SINGING ASPECT OF IT IS THE PART THAT IS SOMEWHAT ASTONISHING.
YEAH.
Jon: WHICH CAME FIRST, THE LOVE OF THE DRAMA, THE LOVE OF THE SONGS? WHICH --
WELL, I MEAN WHEN I WAS LIKE FIVE YEARS OLD I THINK, I WASN'T LIKE PERFORMING HAMLET IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR. IT WAS MORE, TLC IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR. BUT I MEAN I'M SO HAPPY TO BE DOING THESE FILMS THAT I GET TO DO BOTH.
Jon: RIGHT. I FEEL LIKE I'M PROBABLY GOING SHOW UP ON MY NEXT SET AND JUST TRY TO BURST INTO SONG ABOUT SOMETHING.
Jon: I THINK YOU SHOULD.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT ANYMORE.
Jon: I WISH EVERYTHING WAS LIKE THAT WHERE YOU WERE JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE INTERVIEW I COULD BE LIKE, ♪ HERE SHE COMES AS AN ACTRESS. ♪  I'M SO NERVOUS TO TALK TO HER.
I CAN TELL YOU, THE WEIRD THING -- .
Jon: ♪  PERHAPS SOME WATER.
THE WEIRD THING ABOUT LIKE SINGING ON SET AND KNOWING THAT, YOU KNOW, THE SCENE IS COMING UP AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE BEING, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE PLAYING A RUNNER IN A MOVIE YOU WOULD BE STRETCHING AND STUFF, SORT OF STAYING WARM.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND YOU'RE, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SORT OF KEEP YOUR VOICE WARM SO YOU ARE DOING ALL THESE -- LIKE THESE WEIRD LIKE VOCAL SILLY EXERCISES. FOR YOUR VOICE TO STAY WARM.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE?
YES. AND SOME OF THE, SOME OF THE LIKE THE CREW MEMBERS WOULD HEAR ME, I WOULD JUST BE SORT OF SITTING, YOU KNOW, WAITING TO GO SHOOT A SCENE AND GO HA, HMMMM, AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE ANNA, CAN WE GET YOU SOMETHING? LIKE I'M, LIKE I'M, LIKE I'M REALLY BAD AT BEING EXASPERATED. LIKE I'M NEW TO PASSIVE AGGRESSION. AND I'M LIKE -- IT'S REALLY COLD IN THIS ROOM.  I WILL HAVE A WATER.
Jon: THAT WAS JUST A WAY, LIKE A HUM. YOU JUST GO -- I COULD USE A LITTLE WATER BUT INSTEAD YOU MAKE A NOISE. BUT-- DO THEY -- DO YOU HAVE TO SING IT EVERY TAKE OR IS THAT A TRACK, HOW DO THEY FILM SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.  SO THERE ARE SCENES WHERE I'M SINGING LIVE AND THAT WAS REALLY GREAT. BUT I AM IN A VERY, VERY LEGITIMATE CORSET SO SOME OF THAT STUFF WHERE I'M RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS, I JUST I CAN'T SING SONG ON TIME IN A CORSET RUNNING UP AND DOWN REAL STEPS.
Jon: CAN'T THEY DO THAT -- LIKE DO THEY REALLY HAVE TO LACE YOU INTO, CAUSE THOSE ARE LIKE A TORTURE DEVICE.
NO JOKE. OH YEAH, AND YOU'RE STUCK IN THERE AND IT IS, IT'S LIKE BEING TEMPORARILY ASTHMATIC SO JUST --
Jon: YOU JUST,  YOU CAN'T GET A BREATH.
THE SIMPLEST THINGS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT.
Jon: YEAH.
AND THERE WAS-- YOU KNOW THAT THING WHEN ARE YOU A LITTLE KID, AND SOMEBODY IS TICKLING YOU AND IT'S REALLY FUN AND SUDDENLY ARE YOU SCREAMING FOR MERCY? AND THIS WAS-- THERE WAS A DAY THAT CHRIS PINE, CHRIS PINE IS SO FUNNY IN THIS MOVIE AND HE WAS MAKING ME LAUGH ON SET.
Jon: YEAH.
AND IT IS GOING WELL AND I WAS THINKING OH LOOK AT THIS IT'S LIKE BEHIND THE SCENES, AND THE ACTORS ARE HAVING FUN. GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. RIGHT.
OH THAT CHRIS PINE.
Jon: YEAH.
AND SUDDENLY I WAS SCREAMING THAT I WAS DYING. AND I WAS LIKE CRYING AT THE CORSET TO GET OUT OF IT. AND THEY LET YOU OUT AND IT TAKES A MINUTE. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I WAS DISHEVELED BUT NOT DYING. AND HAD-- YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY SAYING LIKE OH, CHRIS WAS DOING THIS REALLY FUNNY SOUTHERN ACCENT, IS NOT LIKE AN ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR HOLDING UP THE SHOOT.
Jon: BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE WORRIED THAT YOU DISAPPOINTED THEM FOR NOT BEING IN AN ACTUAL MEDICAL EMERGENCY.
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE GIRL WHO CRIED WOLF, I GUESS.
Jon: RIGHT. NO, YOU JUST WANT TO BE THE GIRL WITHOUT MAKES WEIRD NOISES AND WANTS WATER. THE THING ABOUT, THOUGH, THE SINGING, WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FROM A CREW, LIKE BECAUSE ACTING AFTER A SCENE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO APPLAUD. BUT TRADITIONALLY FOLLOWING A SONG, YOU SHOULD APPLAUD. DOES THE CREW AT A CERTAIN POINT GO SURE, OKAY?
NO.
Jon: WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL FOR THAT?
THERE IS NO-- THERE IS NO CLAPPING OR ANYTHING BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS NICE TO HEAR THE CREW LIKE THE WHOLE NEXT WEEK SINGING YOUR SONG LIKE AS THEY ARE DOING WORK, LIKE HUMMING A PIECE OF YOUR SONG, AND I WAS LIKE, SEE?
Jon: REALLY? SO THERE'S LIKE, THERE'S A TEAMSTER.
LIKE KENNY THE GRIP IS LIKE, HE'S VERY SMART PRINCE. IT WAS LIKE --
Jon: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE -- I JUST THINK THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN. LIKE IT'S HARD TO HAVE A [BLEEP] DAY ON A MUSICAL IT WOULD SEEM. BECAUSE EVERYBODY, LIKE NO MATTER HOW BAD ARE YOU FEELING, IT'S LIKE OKAY, TWO, THREE, FOUR AND YOU HAVE TO JUMP IN.
YEAH. I MEAN, THIS MUSICAL IS -- THE FIRST HALF OF IT IS THE FAIRY TALES AS YOU KNOW THEM SO THAT IS FUN.
Jon: SURE.
AND IT'S SO FUNNY AND ALIVE AND AMAZING. AND THEN THE SECOND HALF IS SORT OF WHERE THINGS FALL APART AND IT IS SORT OF ABOUT HOW FAIRY TALES ARE DISHONEST AND THEY TELL US THAT THINGS IN OUR LIVES ARE GOING TO BE SIMPLE AND THEY AREN'T. AND SO THE SECOND HALF OF THE FILM SOME ABOUT-- .
Jon: CAN YOU JUST ONE SECOND, JUST ONE SECOND. BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER IS PROBABLY WATCHING. SHE'S [BLEEP] KIDDING. (LAUGHTER) IT'S ALL -- JUST GO-- GO TO BED, HONEY.
THINGS ARE COMPLICATED BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.
Jon: LIFE'S A DREAM, SWEETIE. GO TO BED. IT'S NICE HAVING YOU ON THE PROGRAM, ANNA. (LAUGHTER) BUT CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING. IT IS REALLY WONDERFUL. AND LIKE I SAID, I MEAN, WE THINK YOU ARE GREAT IN EVERYTHING.
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE, WE APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
"INTO THE WOODS". IT OPENS ON CHRISTMAS DAY WHICH I HEAR IS A GOOD DAY FOR MOVIE GOING. ANNA KENDRICK, EVERYBODY.
