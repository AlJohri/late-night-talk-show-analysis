Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE WHO I CAN IMAGINE, CNN SHOULD HAVE USED HIS ERECTION TONIGHT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT MAY EVEN BE MORE VISIBLE THAN THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING'S SPIRE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S BEEN A GOOD NIGHT I GUESS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, I GUESS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. HERE'S ONE SENATE SEAT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAD TO HAVE, IT'S IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN WAS RUNNING AGAINST SCOTT BROWN, THE REPUBLICAN. THE RESULTS ARE IN. SHAHEEN HAS DEFEATED SCOTT BROWN (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) APPARENTLY, VERMONT HAS NOW ERECTED A BORDER FENCE TO KEEP SCOTT BROWN FROM RUNNING THERE. (LAUGHTER) SO, AND THIS IS ONE THAT I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN, THE FLORIDA RACE BETWEEN CHARLIE CRIST BALL FAN AND GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT CAME DOWN TO THE WIRE, THE RESULTS ARE IN, GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT HAS DEFEATED CHARLIE CRIST -- AND THEN WAIT, WHAT THE NO -- NO! WHAT A TERRIBLE SITUATION FOR CHARLIE CRIST TO BE EATEN BY A GATOR. HOW IRONIC. (LAUGHTER) JOINING US VIA SATELLITE FROM G.O.P. HEADQUARTERS, I APOLOGIZE, THERE'S A BIT OF A DELAY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME, SIR. THERE MAY BE A LITTLE  BIT OF A DELAY. PLEASE WELCOME, CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE REINCE PRIEBUS. REINCE, HOW ARE YOU, SIR? CAN YOU HEAR ME?
I'M DOING GREAT, JON.
Jon: YOU CAN HEAR ME.
I CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE. YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: IS THIS THE GREATEST NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE? (CHUCKLES)
IT RANKS UP THERE, JON, WITH A LOT OF GOOD NIGHTS. BUT TONIGHT IS CERTAINLY HISTORIC AND I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING MORE WINS TONIGHT IN THE SENATE AND THERE'S MORE TO COME.
Jon: IT'S A BLOOD BATH OUT THERE. (LAUGHTER) WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE DEMOCRATS' STRATEGY SEEMED TO BE -- AGAIN, I'M NOT A POLITICAL STRATEGIST -- CURLING UP IN A BALL AND HOPING YOU DIDN'T KICK THEM IN THE FACE TOO HARD? WAS THAT A SURPRISING STRATEGY?
IT WAS A SURPRISING STRATEGY. (LAUGHTER) WE KEPT OUR HEAD DOWN AND WE WORKED HARD AND WE GOT GREAT CANDIDATES OUT THERE AND I THINK IT REALLY IS A REJECTION OF WASHINGTON, A REJECTION OF OBAMA AND REALLY A NEED FOR THIS COUNTRY TO GET THIS ECONOMY TURNED AROUND AND, OBVIOUSLY, TONIGHT IS THE START OF THAT.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SO INTERESTING. YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD ALL THESE MONTHS OF JOB GROWTH. MAY NOT BE GREAT JOB GROWTH BUT IT'S GROWTH, WE'VE HAD A GDP INTEREST. BUT THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT SEEM IN ANY WAY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO TELL THAT STORY. AND I MEAN, TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, AND I FOLLOW THE ELECTIONS -- WELL, I DON'T FOLLOW THEM -- (LAUGHTER) -- BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT REPUBLICANS RAN ON OTHER THAN OBAMA IS STALIN AND EBOLA IS GOING TO KILL YOUR GRANDPARENTS. WHAT, WHAT WAS -- YEAH --
WELL, JON.  WELL, I MEAN, EACH OF THESE STATES HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE STORY.
Jon: SURE.
I MEAN, I CAN TELL YOU LIKE IN WISCONSIN, OBVIOUSLY, SCOTT WALKER IS TALKING ABOUT HIS OWN SUCCESSES IN WISCONSIN. JONI ERNST IS TALKING ABOUT HER PLAN TO PASS A BUDGET IN THE SENATE, TO PASS KEYSTONE PIPELINE IN THE SENATE. BUT THEY ALSO TIED I THINK AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS PERVASIVE AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T HAPPY WITH THIS PRESIDENT, THEY DIDN'T THINK HE WAS LEADING ABROAD AND HE WASN'T ENGAGING DOMESTICALLY, SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN HAPPENING THAT WERE POSITIVE IN REGARD TO JOBS AND THE STOCK MARKET, ET CETERA, PEOPLE WEREN'T FEELING THAT AT HOME. SO IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF WISCONSIN OR IN THE MIDDLE OF COLORADO, YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THE ECONOMY IS DOING ANY BETTER FOR YOU.
Jon: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS YOU ONLY TALK IN SWING STATES. THERE'S ONLY -- (LAUGHTER)
THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO US.
Jon: SO LET ME, IS IT -- ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT GOVERNING AGAIN? BECAUSE IT'S, YOU KNOW, FOR SIX YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN IN OPPOSITIONAL POSITION TRYING TO STOP ANYTHING. IS IT GOING TO BE HARD TO STOP THAT? IS IT GOING TO BE HARD TO DO THINGS? (LAUGHTER)
THAT FEELING. NO, I -- (LAUGHTER) LISTEN...
Jon: SETTLE DOWN! SETTLE DOWN.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE IS THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET THINGS DONE. YOU DO NEED THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE ON A BILL AND WE STILL NEED TO DO THAT, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE PRESIDENT SAYING, LISTEN, I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU, I WANT TO PASS SOME OF THESE JOBS BILLS, I WANT TO PASS THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE AND GET THINGS DONE. BUT IT STARTS WITH THE PRESIDENT SO NOW I THINK WE CAN BOX HIM IN AND GET THIS DONE.
Jon: IS THERE -- RIGHT -- IS THERE ANY THOUGHT AT SOME POINT YOU WILL JUST LEARN HIS SIGNATURE AND, REALLY, IT WILL BE YOUR OWN COUNTRY AT THAT POINT? (LAUGHTER)
WELL LISTEN, IF THE NIGHT GETS ANY BETTER, MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT, TOO. BUT WE'LL WAIT AND SEE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, WELL, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU, SIR. OBVIOUSLY CONGRATULATIONS TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. REINCE PRIEBUS, THANKS FOR JOINING US. WE APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS. THANK YOU.
