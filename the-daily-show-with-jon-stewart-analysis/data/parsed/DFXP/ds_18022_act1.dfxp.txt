Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART,  TONIGHT WE HAVE GOOD GUEST, DIRECTOR-- DIRECTOR AND STAR  OF BROOKLYN CASTLE. THE FASCINATING DOCUMENTARY  ABOUT CHESS CHAMPIONS IN AN  INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL IN THE  CITY. I GIVE IT SIX PAWNS UP, I  DON'T KNOW CHESS. SO ROOKS? I'M AN IDIOT. LET'S START TONIGHT WITH THE  ELECTION. YOU KNOW THE ELECTION THAT  JUST ENDED AND THE ONE YOU  DON'T EVER REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT AGAIN, THAT ONE. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ARE  NEVER JUST ABOUT VOTING ON  WHO GETS TO RUN NAKED  THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I'M LOOKING AT YOU,  EISENHOWER. (LAUGHTER)  SOMEBODY'S BEEN WORKING OUT. IT'S ALSO ABOUT BALLOT  REFERENDUMS, REFERENDA-- BALLOTS   BALLOTS-- IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BALLOT INITIATIVES YOU  HAVE TO TALK CALIFORNIA. A STATE THAT LOVES  REFERENDUMS EVEN MORE THAN  IT DOES PUTTING AVOCADOS ON  ON THINGS THAT IT DOESN'T BELONG ON. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU  PEOPLE, THAT IS A CHEESE  STEAK, WHY WOULD YOU MUT  AVOCADO ON A CHEESE STAKE. WHAT DID THEY VOTE, A TAX  EXEMPT STAT TO US WEIRDOES  ON THE BOURD WALK WITH  SNAKES ON A SHOULDER, CUPCAKES MUST HAVE AT LEAST  3% KALE.
DMAL CALL VOTERS AGREED  TO PAY MORE IN SALES TAX AND  MORE IN INCOME TAX FOR HIGH EARNERS TO HELP CLOSE WHAT  GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN CALLS A  $34 BILLION STATE BUDGET CAP.
OH. CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY DECIDING  TO START TRYING TO PAY FOR  SOME OF THE [BLEEP] THEY WANT TO DO. MY BABY'S GROWING UP. (LAUGHTER)  ANY OTHER REFERENDUM.
53% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS  REJECTED A REFERENDUM THAT  WOULD HAVE ABOLISHED THE DEATH PENALTY.
WHAT'S UP, CALIFORNIA. PAYING YOUR BILLS, THINNING  THE HERD. YOU ARE YOUR TURNING INTO  YOUR DAD! NEXT THING YOU KNOW  EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE  TO WEAR A CONDOM IN  CALIFORNIA.
THIS LOS ANGELES VOTERS  DECIDED IT THAT MALE PORN  STARS MUST WEAR CONDOMS DURING FILMING. (LAUGHTER)  SO IN LOS ANGELES YOU GUYS  FOCUS GROUP EVERYTHING? ARE ALL PORN DECISIONS  COMMUNITY-BASED. SHOULD THE MUSIC IN PORN  HAVE SO MUCH BASS. ARE WE DOING TOO MANY SCENES  OUT BY THE POOL, YES OR NO. HOW MANY GUYS HAVE TO BE  THERE BEFORE THE SCENE  STARTS TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT  GAY. MORE OR LESS THAN FIVE. (APPLAUSE)  OF COURSE, IT IS LESS THAN  FIVE-- OF COURSE FOR THE  MOST NUANCED TAKE ON THIS ISSUE YOU REALLY NEED TO  TUNE INTO THAT NEW SHOW A  CROSS-SECTION OF ADULT WOMEN GIGGLE ABOUT SEX. I'M SORRY, THAT IS MY TiVO'S  PROGRAM DECISION, I MEANT  THE VIEW.
I THOUGHT THIS ONE WOULD  INTEREST YOU. REQUIRED USE OF CONDOMS IN  PORN MOVIES. LOS ANGELES --
WAIT A MINUTE.
NO, NO, NOT IN THE MOVIE  THEATRE-- BARBARA! ARE YOU HAVING SEX IN THE  MOVIE THEATRES? (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T KNOW WHAT I --
OH, I THINK YOU KNOW  EXACTLY WHAT--   (LAUGHTER)  YOU MINTION. LET ME REASSURE YOU, MISS  WALTERS YOU CAN STILL  CONTINUE TO HAVE YOUR  UNPROTECTED MOVIE THEATRE  SEX. (LAUGHTER)  MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FILMING  IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO  BREAK THE LAW. BUT THERE WAS ONE OTHER  ISSUE BURNING UP BALLOTS IN  SEVERAL STATES, ACTUALLY  HANG ON A SECOND. LET ME JUST-- OKAY, YEAH,  HERE WE GO. ROLL THE CLIP.
VOTERS IN WASHINGTON  STATE AND COLORADO APPROVED  BALLOT INITIATIVES  LEGALIZING MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL USE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I KNOW MY AUDIENCE. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S SAD, THE MOST EXCITED  I'VE SEEN THEM ALL DAY. TWO STATES VOTED TO  DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA USE  FOR RECREATION. NO MORE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR  ACUTE SPORADIC SOCIAL  ANXIETY DISORDER. THE NEWS, BROUGHT MIXED  REACTION STARTING IN THE  CONSUMER/ENTHUSIAST  COMMUNITY.
IT MEANS I'M GOING TO  SMOKE A LOT OF WEED TONIGHT. WHOOO! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES, AND BY THE WAY,  WHAT WOULD IT MEAN IF YOU  HAD LOST THE REFERENDUM.
IT MEANS I'M GOING TO  SMOKE A LOT OF WEED TONIGHT. WHOOO! (APPLAUSE)
Jon: AND WHAT WOULD IT  MEAN IF THE BRONCOS BEAT THE  PANTHERS ON SUNDAY.
IT MEANS I'M GOING TO  SMOKE A LOT OF WEED TONIGHT. WHOOO! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT WOULD IT MEAN  IF-- GRAVITY WAS STILL AN  EFFECT ON EARTH.
IT MEANS I'M GOING TO  SMOKE A LOT OF WEED TONIGHT. WHOOO!
Jon: HE'S CONSISTENT. WITHIN THE MEDIA IT WAS A  TALE OF TWO AN KERS. I'M GOING TO PLAY YOU BOTH  ANCHORS DISCUSSING THE  STORY. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THE  NARC.
THE GOVERNOR OF COLORADO  ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING  IT'S STILL ILLEGAL IN THE EYES OF FEDERAL LAW SO POT  SMOKERS SHOULDN'T BREAK OUT  THE CHEETOES OR GOLDFISH TOO  QUICKLY. I'M SURE THAT POT SMOKERS  KNOW WHAT HE MEANT THERE.
I GUESS THEY DON'T HAVE  ENTENMANNS OUT THERE.
I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE A  GUESS, I HAVE HEARD THE TERM  MUNCHIES BEFORE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MALOMARS,  WAS THAT NO GOOD ANY MORE? (APPLAUSE)
Jon: LOOK AT WILLIAMS. WILLIAMS IS GOING FULL METAL  STONER ON THIS. (LAUGHTER)
LESTER, YOU HAVE HEARD  ANYTHING ABOUT GETTING TWO  LEGOS AND PUTTING ICE CREAM BETWEEN THOSE THINGS AND  JUST--   (LAUGHTER)  SO THE NARC IS CLEARLY NOT  BRIAN WILLIAMS. OR MAYBE IT IS, WE WON'T  KNOW UNTIL WE SEE HIS  COMPETITION.
WHAT DO WE SAY TO THE  PARENTS AND KIDS AND THAT IS  A WHOLE OTHER DEBATE.
WHAT IS TO KEEP SOMEBODY  FROM GETTING POTTED UP ON  WEED AND GETTING BEHIND THE  WHEEL? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I BELIEVE WE HAVE  OUR NARC. COME ON, STEVE, BE COOL,  IT'S WEEDED UP ON POT. I JUST IMAGINE HIM, WHAT ARE  YOU-- ARE YOU GIFS POTTING ! (LAUGHTER)  THE MOST AMAZING THING ABOUT  THIS STORY IS HOW MUCH JUST  TALKING ABOUT A MARIJUANA STORY GIVES NEWS ANCHORS THE  GIGGLES.
COLORADO IS ABOUT TO GIVE  NEW MEANING TO THE TERM  ROCKIE MOUNTAIN HIGH.
A GOOD NIGHT FOR POT  SMOKERS. THERE WERE SEVERAL-- THERE  WERE SEVERAL INITIATIVES ON  THE BALLOT.
WHAT STATES HAVE GONE TO  POT THERE, WILLIAMS.
HIGH TIMES IN COLORADO.
THEY ARE GETTING HIGH  ROCKIE MOUNTAIN STYLE.
CHIEF AND CHONG REJOICE,  DOWD WHERE'S MY POT.
THE KIDS HAVE THE TWO  BONG HIT LUNCH. WHATEVER A BONG IS.
THEY MIGHT END UP DOING  THAT ANYWAYS.
YEAH, WHAT'S A BONG.
Jon: DID YOU HEAR THAT BE,  WHAT SAY BONG. 6 COURSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW  WHAT A BONG IS, YOU  CONDITION SNIFF IT OFF OFF A  HOOKER'S TEET, IT AIN'T WORTH KNOW APPROXIMATING  ABOUT. BUT ACTUALLY-- THE  LEGALLIZATION OF MARIJUANA  IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. IT'S GOT MAJOR RAM ANY  SITUATION-- RAM MI  MI-- RAMIFICATIONS FOR  AMERICA'S FAILED WAR ON  DRUGS. ALING TAKES US THROUGH THE  NEW LAW AND WHAT THIS MEANS.
JON, I'M HERE IN THE MILE  HIGH CITY, CAPITAL OF WHAT  JUST BECAME THE MILE HIGH  STATE. WHATEVER THAT MEANS. ALL THIS POT JARGON IS  FOREIGN TO ME. PASS THE DUTCHIE ON THE  LEFT-HAND SIDE? I MEAN WHY DON'T THEY PASS  IT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. I DON'T KNOW. I'VE NEVER SMOKED POT. 4R56  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SETTLE DOWN WITH THE  WORD PLAY AND TELL US ABOUT  THE REFERENDUM.
FINE, WE'LL DO IT YOUR  WAY. AS OF TUESDAY IN COLORADO  YOU CAN NOW CARRY WITHOUT  PENALTY UP TO AN OUNCE OF  RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA. HOWEVER MUCH THAT IS. I DON'T KNOW. IS THAT A LOT? I DON'T SMOKE POT OR HAVE A  BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF  SECOND GRADE LEVEL WEIGHTS  AND MEASURES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I CAN TELL YOU HOW  MUCH AN OUNCE IS, IT IS  ENOUGH TO SEND YOU A JAIL FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS IN  FLORIDA.
SOUNDS LIKE FLORIDA COULD  USE A REEFER REN DUMB OF  THEIR OWN. SINCE THEY CAN'T VOTE WITH A  FELONY CONVICTION ON THE  RECORD. WHATEVER THAT MEANS. MUNCHIES, COTTON MOUTH.
Jon: IT'S NOT FUNNY,  ANCHORS ARE MAKING A JOKE  ABOUT POT, IT'S KIND OF CUTE HOW THEY USED TO SMOKE POT  BUT NOW THEY DON'T. EVEN THOUGH NEARLY HALF OF  AMERICAN TEENAGER SMOKED POT  BUT ONLY CERTAIN GET  ARRESTED AND HAVE THEIR LIVES RUINED. DISPROPORTIONAL LEITH HURTS  PEOPLE OF COLOR. SIMPLE POSSESSION PEOPLE IN  COLORADO.
YEAH, BUT YOU HAVE READ  THOSE INCARCERATION STATS ON  WEED?
Jon: IT NICE, LOOK, WE  SPENT $8 BILLION A YEAR  LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR  MARIJUANA.
VERY TRUE, IN FACT I MET  TWO VICTIMS OF THESE  DRACONIAN LAWS.
Jon: GOOD.
NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS  BRUTALLY ARRESTED FOR  TOCQUING JUST THE TINY BIT  OF LABRADOR WHICH I'M GUESSING IS SOME SORT OF  NARCOTIC.
Jon: THERE IS NO WAY WILL  YOU COVER THIS STORY  SERIOUSLY, IS THERE.
LOOK THIS IS HOW WE DO TV  NEWS, JON. YOU WANT A WELL RESEARCHED  REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE OR  YOU WANT FOOTAGE OF ME ON A WINDBREAKER ON THE BEACH  CLINGING TO A LAMPPOST WHILE  WAVES TICKLE ME ASS? HUH?
Jon: LAMPPOST.
DAMN RIGHT YOU WANT THE  LAMPPOST. NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I  HAVE TO JOIN SOME GUYS FOR A  VAPORIZER SESSION. WHICH I BELIEVE IS A NEW WAY  OF GETTING POTTED UP.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I DIDN'T
