THE SUPREME COURT ISN'T  THE ONLY COURT IN THE LAND. LET'S CHECK IN WITH OUR  CRIMINAL COURTS. YESTERDAY THE BEGUN THE  TRIAL OF GEORGE ZIMMERMAN  WHO STAND AS CAUSED OF  MURDERING TRAYVON MARTIN, A TRAGIC INCIDENT AND I DO NOT  WANT TO BE GLIB BY MAKING A  JOKE ABOUT THIS, SO LET'S JUST SEE HOW THE FIRST DAY  WENT.
THE WAY THE DEFENSE BEGAN  ITS STATEMENTS, REPORTEDLY  LEFT FOLKS IN THE COURTROOM STONE-FACED, A JOKE THAT  FELL FLAT.
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, HE DID NOT DO THAT. PLEASE, PLEASE TELL ME THAT  ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER DID NOT  OPEN WITH A JOKE.
LET ME SAY I WOULD LIKE  TO TELL YOU A LITTLE JOKE.
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T-- IF  YOU DON'T LIKE IT OR YOU  DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY OR APPROPRIATE, THAT YOU DON'T  HOLD IT AGAINST  MR. ZIMMERMAN. YOU CAN HOLD IT AGAINST ME  IF YOU WANT BUT NOT  MR. ZIMMERMAN. IF I HAVE YOUR ASSURANCE YOU  WON'T --
YOU GOT TO LOVE LAWYER  JOKES, BY THE WAY, ALWAYS  PREFACED WITH A LENGTHY DISCLAIMER PREASSIGNING  LEGAL LIABILITY TO ANY  DAMAGE THAT THE JOKE MIGHT  INCUR. (APPLAUSE)  THE FOLLOWING JOKE HERE  AFTER REFERRED TO AS THE  JOKE IS PROVIDED SOLELY TO AMUSE AND ENTERTAIN THE  LISSER OWNERS. THE JOKE TELLER-- RESULTING  FROM ANY OFFENSE, EMBARRASSITY  RAISED BY SAID JOKE, PAR 2 THE JOKE THIS JOKE PROVIDES  THAT A RABBI AN PROCEDURES  PURSUANT TO AN ORAL  AGREEMENT JOINTLY PURCHASE A CAR HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS  THE AUTOMOBILE. AFTER THE SAID PURCHASE, THE  RABBI WITNESSES THE PRIEST  SPRINKLING WATER ON THE AUTOMOBILE AND ASKS WHAT ARE  YOU DOING? THE PRIEST ALLEGEDLY  RESPONDED THAT HE WAS  BLESSING THE AUTOMOBILE. ALTHOUGH THE DESCRIPTION OF  THIS STATEMENT IS NOT  INTENDED TO PROVE THE TRUTH  OF THE MATTER ASSERTED, NOR TO ENDORSE THE EXISTENCE OR  EFFECTIVENESS OF A BLESSING. THE RABBI REPLIES OKAY,  SINCE WE'RE DOING THAT, AND  TAKES OUT A HAX SAW AND CUTS TWO INCHES OFF THE TAILPIPE. THE JOKE TELLER OBSERVES ALL  RIGHTS CONCERNING THE  REPUTATION, DISSEMINATION  AND MODIFICATION OF SAID JOKE, I AM OUTA HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OKAY. THAT'S FUNNY, PEOPLE, ALL  RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, DEFENSE ATTORNEY  DON WEST, YOU HAD A YEAR OF  PREPARATION TO WRITE THIS  JOKE. TO DO IT IN THIS SCENARIO,  YOU MUST BE CONFIDENT IN IT. TAKE IT AWAY.
HERE'S HOW IT GOES. NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE. WHO'S THERE. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WHO? ALL RIGHT, GOOD, YOU'RE ON  THE JURY. NOTHING?
WHAT THE [BLEEP] WAS THAT? DON WEST, EVERYBODY, DON  WEST. AND THAT-- THAT LITTLE JOKE  FROM DON WEST, MY FRIEND S  HOW KANYE LOST A TITLE FOR WORST THING EVER SAID TO A  CROWDED ROOM BY SOMEONE WITH  A LAST NAME WEST. KANYE, OF COURSE, TOOK THAT  TITLE FROM ADAM WEST WHO IN  1982 TOLD A PACKED COMIC BOOK CONVENTION TO SUCK HIS  BACK [BLEEP]. THAT IS ALL TRUE, THAT'S ALL  TRUE. LOOK, I'M A COMEDIAN. WE'VE ALL BOMBED BEFORE,  ALBEIT NOT WITH SOMEONE'S  LIFE AT STAKE. HE JUST GOT TO LET IT GO,  DUST YOURSELF OFF, MOVE ON.
ANY MORE BAD-- NO MORE  BAD JOKES, I PROMISE THAT. I AM CONVINCED IT WAS THE  DELIVERY THOUGH. I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS  FUNNY.
WOW.
THAT MAKES TWO PEOPLE IN  THAT COURTROOM WHO HAVE  STOOD THEIR GROUND AFTER DOING SOMETHING AWFUL. AYLINGEDLY, ALLEGEDLY,  ALLEGEDLY, AT THIS POINT. LOOK, THE POINT IS, THIS IS  SO BAD, YOU HAVE GOT TO FEEL  SYMPATHY FOR GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN. THERE ARE TWO THINGS YOU DO  NOT WANT TO HEAR AT YOUR  MURDER TRIAL. WE FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY,  AND KNOCK, KNOCK. IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER. NOW NORMALLY THE MOST CRINGE  INDUCING THING ABOUT THESE  COURT CASES IS THE MEDIA  COVERAGE. BUT ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER HAS  SET THE BAR SO LOW, THE  MEDIA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO  SQUEAK UNDER IT. SO I GUESS THE CHALLENGE IS  YOURS TO ACCEPT, MEDIA. CAN YOU LIMBO? HOW LOW CAN YOU GO. YOU'RE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN, I'M  TRAYVON MARTIN. YOU'RE CLAIMING I'M ON THE  GROUND AND I'M ON TOP OF YOU  AND I HAVE ACTUALLY,  ACCORDING TO YOU, PUNCHED YOU 25 TO 30 TIMES.
ZIMMERMAN GRABS IT, TAKES  IT OUT, AND BOOM.
TRAYVON FALLS BACK AND  SAYS YOU GOT ME, YOU GOT ME.
SO HE CLAIMS HE SPREAD  TRAYVON'S ARMS OUT LIKE THAT  OPINIONS SOMEBODY'S LYING. (LAUGHTER)  A WORD OF ADVICE, IF I MAY. PACE YOURSELF. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG  TRIAL. IT'S ONLY DAY ONE AND YOU  ARE ALREADY ILLUSTRATING  LEGAL POINTS BY DRY HUMPING  IN THE MINIKITCHEN. ACTUALLY, MAYBE IT WOULD BE  MORE HELPFUL IF I TOLD YOU  THIS IN THE FORM OF A KNOCK, KNOCK JOKE. AND LET ME JUST QUICKLY SAY  TO THE STUDIO AUDIENCE, DOW  NOT NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN  THIS. KNOCK, KNOCK. WHO'S THERE? ORANGE. ORANGE WHO.
OR WHANG-- ORANGE YOU  SUPPOSED TO BE BETTER AT  DOING YOUR [BLEEP] THAN IN? WE'LL BE RIGHT BA
