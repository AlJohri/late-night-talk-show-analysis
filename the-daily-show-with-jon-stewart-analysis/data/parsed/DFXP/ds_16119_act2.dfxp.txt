INTERSTREW GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, MITCH DANIELS, AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, IT'S GOING TO GO  VERY LONG, SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IS, WITH AS FEW CUTS AS POSSIBLE, PRESENT IT IN  A WAY THAT IS COHERENT AND MAKES SENSE AND EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE UP ON THE WEB, SO, I MEAN, I  KNOW HOW YOU KIDS ON THE WEB LIKE THE WATCH PEOPLE TALK TO GOVERNORS. [LAUGHTER] HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "KEEPING THE REPUBLIC: SAVING AMERICA BY TRUSTING AMERICANS."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM GOVERNOR MITCH DANIELS. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. "KEEPING THE REPUBLIC: SAVING AMERICA BY TRUSTING AMERICANS,"  AND YOU'VE MET US, AMERICANS.
YOU ASKING ME? I'VE MET A FEW.
Jon: AND YOU STILL TRUST US? [LAUGHTER]
I CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR CASE, JON.
YOU'VE SEEN THE "DANCING WITH THE STARS" CONTROVERSY. SO FOR YOU, NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU WERE... YOU ARE STILL SPOKEN OF IN VERY I THINK ALMOST SACRED  TERMS AS THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNOR THAT COULD SAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT  COULD BE PRESIDENT. A WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE YOU TO BE PRESIDENT OR AT LEAST VICE PRESIDENT.
Jon:
ONE WOMAN?
Jon: IT'S OUR AUDIENCE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. [FIVE MINUTES LATER]
Jon: THE TROUBLE WITH THE PLAN, THEY KEEP SAYING, THE GOVERNMENT IS OUT OF CONTROL. THEY'RE SPENDING MORE THAN THEY TAKE IN. THEY'RE CRAZY. THEY'RE LIKE DRUNKEN SAILORS, BUT WHEN THEY WERE IN CHARGE, THEY HAD AN UNPAID-FOR MEDICAID BILL OF A TRILLION DOLLARS, THEY HAD TWO WARS. THEY DIDN'T RAISE TAXES DURING TWO WARS. THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEFICIT. USING THAT STUDY THAT I HAVE, AND WE HAVE IT TO PUT UP, PEW, WHATEVER THE NAME OF THAT RESEARCH CENTER IS, THE 2001, 2003 TAX CUTS RESPONSIBLE FOR $1.7 TRILLION. THE IRAQ WARS, APPARENTLY THE STIMULUS AND ALL THAT WAS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR $700 BILLION OF THAT. IT'S HARD TO LISTEN TO THOSE FOLKS AND TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE  THEY'RE SAYING, "WE NEED TO STOP SPENDING WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE IN  CHARGE, BUT WHEN PRINCE ARE IN CHARGE, WE NEED TO JUST DO WHATEVER WE DO."
AFTER 9/11, I FORGOT THIS AND SOMEBODY SENT ME A COPY. I WENT TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND SAID, LOOK  HOW MUCH SPENDING WAS CUT. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE WAR, THEN OTHER PRIORITIES OUGHT TO BE POSTPONED FOR A WHILE, AND THAT'S WHAT HARRY TRUMAN DID  WHEN WE WENT INTO KOREA, WHAT F.D.R. DID WHEN WE WENT INTO WORLD WAR II, AND IT'S VERY FAIR  TO SAY, REPUBLICANS WERE IN CONGRESS, I GOT NOWHERE WITH THAT ARGUMENT. YOU'RE QUITE CORRECT. THE COSTS WERE ADDED ON. I'M JUST SAYING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK FORWARD AT THE PROBLEMS THAT ALARM ME, AND I REALLY  BELIEVE SHOULD ALARM EVERY AMERICAN WHO CARES ABOUT THE AMERICAN PROMISE OF UPWARD  MOBILITY THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY, THEN RELIT GAITING  THAT IS NOT GOING TO GET US VERY FAR. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT STEPS CAN WE TAKE TO...
Jon: THAT'S A FAIR POINT. WHEN WE COME BACK THEN WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND WE  WON'T RE-LITIGATE. WE'LL BE
