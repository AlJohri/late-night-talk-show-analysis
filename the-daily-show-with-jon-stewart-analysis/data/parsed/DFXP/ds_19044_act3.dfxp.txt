[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW FILM COMING OUT CALLED "HER."
WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT SAMANTHA?
OH, GOD, SHE'S SO MANY THINGS. I GUESS WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT HER IS SHE ISN'T JUST ONE THING, SHE'S SO MUCH LARGER THAN THAT.
THANKS THEODORE.
SEE SAMANTHA, HE'S SO MUCH MORE EVOLVED THAN I AM. [LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING? I USED TO BE SO WORRIED ABOUT NOT HAVING A BODY,  BUT NOW I TRULY LOVE IT. I'M GROWING IN A WAY I COULDN'T IF I HAD A PHYSICAL FORM. I MEAN I'M NOT LIMITED. I CAN BE ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE SIMULTANEOUSLY. I'M NOT TETHERED TO TIME AND SPACE IN A WAY THAT I WOULD BE IF I WAS STUCK IN A BODY THAT'S INEVITABLY GOING TO DIE.
Jon: I'VE BEEN ON THOSE DATES. PLEASE WELCOME SCARLETT JOHANSSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE. IT'S A RARE CREATION. YOU AND JOAQUIN AND SPIKE, YOU'VE PUT TOGETHER REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PROJECT.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. IT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, I CAME IN THE POST PRODUCTION PART OF IT. SO I REALLY DIDN'T GET TO SEE ANY OF THE FILMING. I WASN'T REALLY A PART OF THAT BUT I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT SORT OF WORKED FOR ME, YOU KNOW, AS A -- CREATIVELY BECAUSE I HAD SUCH AN INTIMATE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH JOAQUIN AND SPIKE OUTSIDE OF THAT AND I THINK  IT CREATED THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT FOR THAT RELATIONSHIP TO GROW.
Jon: HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIS OPERATING SYSTEM. YOU PLAY THE OPERATING SYSTEM. WE NEVER SEE YOU PHYSICALLY. >>RIGHT, YES. IT'S SORT OF LIKE SIRI BUT AN ADVANCED TYPE OF SIRI. NO OFFENSE TO SIRI.
Jon: NO.
OF COURSE. BUT SHE'S GROWING THROUGH HER EXPERIENCES, SHE'S DEVELOPING, SHE'S EXCITED ABOUT LIFE. SHE'S REALLY BUT A BABE WHEN WE FIRST MEET HER AND SHE JUST, SHE EVOLVES INTO A -- SHE SORT OF TRANSCENDS TIME AND SPACE  AND BECOMES A WHOLE KIND OF...PART OF THE ETHER I GUESS.
Jon: IT'S HARD, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE GOING OUT WITH A GIRL WHO TRANSCENDS TIME AND SPACE LIKE THAT, AND YOU'RE A GUY WHO JUST WANTS TO WATCH A MOVIE, MAYBE A GAME, IT'S HARD -- THERE IS THAT POINT WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE HE IS AT SUCH A DISADVANTAGE. BUT YOU DON'T-- YOU THINK ORIGINALLY OH, THIS SHE DOESN'T HAVE A BODY. BUT HE IS AT THE DISADVANTAGE.
THERE'S A LOT OF ADVANTAGES TO NOT HAVING A BODY ACTUALLY.
Jon: I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE BODY THAT YOU HAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I THINK, I, PERHAPS, CAN SPEAK TO IT PERHAPS BETTER THAN YOU CAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ALL HAVE THE THINGS WE'D LIKE TO CHANGE ABOUT OURSELVES.
Jon: I AM FALLING APART JOHANSSON. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE LIVING IN THIS BAG OF BONES? [LAUGHTER] HAS IT CHANGE THE  WAY YOU VIEW -- I FOUND MYSELF AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE, I FOUND MYSELF ODDLY SELF- CONSCIOUS AROUND MY COMPUTER. [ LAUGHTER ] IN A WAY THAT I --
LIKE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS WINKING AT YOU SOMETIMES OR WHAT?
Jon: BUT SENTIENT, IN A WAY THAT IT UNDERSTOOD THINGS ABOUT ME AT A LEVEL NOT THROUGH INTERACTION OR DIALOGUE, BUT JUST THROUGH WHAT I DO AND SEARCH AND WORK ON AND IT KNOWS ME IN A WAY THAT MADE ME UPSET. >>MHM, MHM.
DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH.
Jon: I WON'T! [LAUGHTER] DO YOU THINK THIS MOVIE IS PRO-TECHNOLOGY? IS IT -- HAS IT CHANGED THE WAY YOU VIEW IT IN ANY WAY?
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY BECAUSE  MY PERSPECTIVE ON IT IS SO SKEWED, YOU KNOW? FOR ME IT'S THIS REALLY, IT'S KIND OF A... DOING THE FILM -- ESPECIALLY WORKING ON IT WITH SPIKE AND DEVELOPING THE CHARACTER AND THE STORY WAS A REAL-- I WAS SAYING TO YOU EARLIER -- IT WAS A KIND OF CATHARSIS FOR BOTH OF US BECAUSE IT WORKS THROUGH THE AWKWARD PARTS OF A RELATIONSHIP  AND THE BEST PARTS OF A RELATIONSHIP AND THE  HEARTBREAKING PARTS, AND WHEN TWO PEOPLE  KIND OF COME TOGETHER AND GO IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND YOU REALIZE THAT'S HAPPENING. AND SO FOR ME IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT  OF IT, SO TO SPEAK. IT FEELS LIKE THIS KIND OF POST-MODERN LOVE STORY AND THAT IS WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM IT WHEN I SAW IT. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, SPIKE HAD TOLD ME THAT CHARLIE KAUFFMAN SAW IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOST TERRIFYING THING HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE.
Jon: IT IS TERRIFYING.
YEAH, THERE'S ASPECTS OF IT I COULD DEFINITELY SEE WHERE SOMEBODY WOULD THINK THAT. BUT OF COURSE FOR ME IT'S JUST ENDLESSLY CHARMING.
Jon: YES, IT IS ENDLESSLY CHARMING, BUT SO YOU'RE DOING IT ALL IN THIS BOOTH, AND YOU HAVE TO THINK-- IT'S LIKE BEING IN AN ANIMATED MOVIE. BUT IT IS VERY SOPHISTICATED, AND VERY ERUDITE, BUT ALSO VERY SEXY, AND IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE BEING IN AN INCREDIBLY INAPPROPRIATE PIXAR MOVIE. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW  WHERE LIKE, WHERE ONE OF THE CARS COMES OUT AND IS LIKE, "HEY WHAT'S GOIN ON --" >>ARE YOU REFERRING TO THAT, I  THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SCENE THAT COULD BE, UM -- THAT SCENE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE DARK-- WELL, WE HAVE SEX BASICALLY.
Jon: THERE'S A SCENE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE DARK, THEY HAVE SEX. IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I WENT TO MY PHONE AND I SAID TO SIRI. I GO, WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP? [LAUGHTER] BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK OF ME THAT WAY.
NO, SHE NO... YEAH, SHE DOESN'T THINK, I GUESS.
Jon: BUT IS HE THERE, ARE YOU IN THE ROOM WITH JOAQUIN, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE WORKING OFF OF?
YES I WAS WORKING ON IT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BECAUSE SPIKE IS NOTHING IF NOT THOROUGH. HE REALLY MILKS IT FOR EVERYTHING, AND SO WE DID IT, WE RECORDED THE FILM IN ITS ENTIRETY AT LEAST 25 OR 30 TIMES OVER MANY MONTHS AND MANY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WITH JOAQUIN, WITH SPIKE, WITH THE RECORDING, SOMETIMES JUST MYSELF, I MEAN ALL DIFFERENT WAYS. IT'S--WELL, YOU'LL  HAVE TO SEE THE FILM.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO SEE IT. WHAT AN -- HE'S AN INCREDIBLE FILMMAKER. THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT I THINK IS WHEN YOU WALK AWAY FROM A MOVIE IS YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, THIS IS STAYING WITH ME. AND THIS IS, IT'S STAYING WITH ME IN A WAY THAT I THINK IS VERY  UPSETTING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S STAYING WITH ME IN A  BEAUTIFUL WAY. IT'S WONDERFUL, SO CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
