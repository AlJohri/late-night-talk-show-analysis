FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE HAVE A FINE PROGRAM TONIGHT. MY GUEST ELIZABETH KOLBERT AUTHOR OF THE SIXTH EXTINCTION ABOUT HOW WE AS A SPECIES DOOMED OURSELVES. IT'S A BEACH READ REALLY. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST, WE WANTED TO WISH GOOD HEALTH TO YOUNG BOB COSTAS. HE DROPPED OUT OF TONIGHT'S COVERAGE DUE TO A NASTY EYE INFECTION. I TOLD HIM, BOB, DO NOT WASH YOUR FACE WITH THE WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT BOB IS ALL, I'M EIGHT-TIME SPORTSCASTER OF THE YEAR BOB COSTAS SURELY MY EYES EYES ARE IMPERVIOUS TO RUSSIAN TOXINS. LOOK AT THE POOR EYE. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S A GOOD MAN WE'RE GOING TO HELP HIM OUT. TO LIFT SOME OF THE BURDEN FROM BOB'S PINK, GOOPY SHOULDERS, HERE IS TONIGHT'S "THE DAILY SHOW" OLYMPICS MOMENT. ♪  THAT DOESN'T SEEM VERY SENSITIVE. HERE WE GO. I CAN DO THIS. YESTERDAY SAW CANADIAN SKIER ALEX BILODEAU WIN HIS SECOND STRAIGHT GOLD IN MEN'S MOGULS. HERE IS ALEX IN THE LEAD AND THIS OTHER DUDE IS CATCHING UP SO HE SHOT HIM RIGHT THERE THE OTHER GUY DIED AND HE FELL OFF A CLIFF. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ULTIMATELY A BIG VICTORY FOR THE GUY WHO SHOT THE OTHER GUY. [LAUGHTER] BOB, STAY AND REST THOSE PEEPERS WE'VE GOT THESE GAMES COVERED FOR YOU. NO PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] MOVING ON AT LAST MONTH'S STATE OF THE UNION PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE ONE THING CLEAR.
LET'S GET IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE THIS YEAR. LET'S GET IT DONE. IT'S TIME.
Jon: OH, IT'S TIME, BABY. [LAUGHTER] AMERICA'S BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS TICKING, BABY. IT'S TIME TO HAVE AN ANCHOR BABY, BABY. BUT OF COURSE THERE WAS ONE MAJOR PROBLEM, UM, REPUBLICANS. MAINLY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. YOU KNOW THIS THING WILL BE DOA WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS AROUND.
THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR AT LEAST THE LAST 15 YEARS. SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO DEAL WITH IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: JUST GOT A BUTT TICKLE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PASS THE NACHOS, I THINK THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THIS IS AMAZING AFTER DECADES OF TRYING TO REFORM WHAT EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES IS A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, THE LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES AGREE THAT NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME.
ALL THE PUNDITS ARE SAYING THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME.
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM SHOULD HAPPEN JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BOLDEN. FOR GOD SAKES WHY NOT?
THE PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL GET CREDIT AND FURTHER BOLSTER THEIR HISPANIC VOTE.
Jon: WHO CARES WHO GETS CREDIT -- FINE HOW WE CALL THE BILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PRESENTS THE ONLY WE LOVE HISPANICS ACT ANO 2014. DOES THAT DO IT.
THE LAST THING ANY OF THE SENATE REPUBLICANS FACING PRIMARIES WANT IS TO OPEN UP THE IMMIGRATION CAN OF WORMS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY ALIENATE THEIR BASE.
I THINK IT'S THE ONE THING THAT COULD COST REPUBLICANS THE SENATE.
Jon: YES, IMMIGRATION REFORM MIGHT ALIENATE SOME OF YOUR BASE BUT MIGHT EMBASEN SOME OF THE ALIENS. REPUBLICANS COULD WIN SOME HISPANIC SUPPORT BUT WOULD YOU RATHER CATER TO THE VOTERS WHO WILL BE DEAD BEFORE YOU CAN SAY THE WORD CHIPOTLE. DAMN YOUR CYNICISM PUNDITS THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS. MARCO RUBIO.
WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THIS IS WHO WE ARE. WE ARE THE MOST COMPASSIONATE NATION ON EARTH. WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WELCOMED PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR OVER 200 YEARS, EACH OF US THE DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF IMMIGRANTS HAVE CREATED THE SINGLE GREATEST SOCIETY MAN HAS EVER KNOWN.
Jon:. ♪ UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL. JUST THE EASTERN EUROPEANS. NOW JUST THE POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS. IN YOUR FACE, DOUBTERS. RUBIO LAID OUT -- [LAUGHTER] RUBIO LAID OUT WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. AND GUESS WHAT? OLD MAJORITY HOUSE LEADER JOHNNY BOEHNER SEES YOUR POLITICAL CALCULATION AND SCOFFS.
REPUBLICANS WILL NOT TRY TO PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM THIS YEAR. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT HE SAID IT WAS TIME. THE GREATEST NATION 200 YEARS -- JUST THE EASTERN EUROPEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT HAPPENED?
THERE'S WIDESPREAD DOUBT ABOUT WHETHER THIS ADMINISTRATION CAN BE TRUSTED TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO MOVE ANY IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION UNTIL THAT CHANGES.
Jon: HOW DID WE GO FROM THIS IS THE TIME TO DEAL WITH THIS IN TWO WEEKS THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T ENFORCE THE LAWS OF AMERICA. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THE PRESIDENT CAN'T BE TRUSTED TO ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE LAND BECAUSE THAT'S HIS WHOLE JOB. OUT OF ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLES THAT'S LIKE THE SECOND ONE. THAT'S RIGHT, I HAVE A CONSTITUTION -- I JUST READ IT FOR THE ARTICLES. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS -- FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS TO SUGGEST THAT THEY WILL NOT ENTERTAIN IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST THIS PRESIDENT TO ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE LAND IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST PROJECTION IN THE HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY. I GIVE YOU THIS REPUBLICAN CONGRESS'S RECORD OF ENFORCING ENACTED LAW.
REPUBLICANS HAVE VOTED 48 TIMES TO REPEAL OBAMACARE.
THEY ARE MOVING TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT HARDER. THEY VOTE TO CUT DODD FRANK.
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUSHED A RECORD NUMBER OF FILIBUSTERS REPUBLICANS BLOCKED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS.
REPUBLICANS BLOCKED APPOINTMENTS AS MATTERS OF GENERAL PRINCIPAL.
Jon: THE G.O.P. SAYING THEY DON'T TRUST THE THE PRESIDENT'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW IS LIKE BOB COSTAS SAYING I DON'T WANT TO BORROW YOUR GLASSES. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'VE BEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WORST PART OF THIS CYNICAL GOVERNANCE, INSTEAD OF HAVING A REAL CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE A DISINGENUOUS-OFF.
THEY WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM BUT THEY DON'T TRUST THE PRESIDENT TO ENFORCE THE LAW, PARTICULARLY THE ENFORCEMENT PARTS. LET'S ENACT THE LAW THIS YEAR BUT SIMPLY NOT LET IT START UNTIL 2017 AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TERM IS OVER.
Jon: NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY OUR FOUNDERS INTENDED. WELL, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T -- [LAUGHTER] [  APPLAUSE  ] -- YOU KNOW, WE GET TOGETHER IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK THIS UNION IS PERFECT,EHH, YOU LIKE TO FORM YOUR OWN UNION? [LAUGHTER] WHAT SAY YOU, NOW, JOHN BOEHNER?
SPEAKER BOEHNER'S OFFICE REJECTED THE IDEA. BOEHNER SPOKESMAN MICHAEL STEELE SAID IT WAS ENTIRELY IMPRACTICAL AND WOULD ELIMINATE ANY INCENTIVE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ENFORCE THE LAWS DURING THE REMAINDER OF HIS SECOND TERM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT MAKES NO SENSE. LET ME SEE IF I HAVE THIS STRAIGHT. WE HAVE AN URGENT ISSUE, IMMIGRATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT STRIKES AT THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE THAT WE MUST SOLVE BUT WE CAN'T BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE PRESIDENT ENFORCING OUR CURRENT DISASTROUS IMMIGRATION LAW IS TO TALK ABOUT BUT NOT DELIVER A BETTER ONE. CHRIS CHRISTIE 2016. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW THERE'S A GUY WHO KNOWS HOW TO CLOG A BORDER. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
