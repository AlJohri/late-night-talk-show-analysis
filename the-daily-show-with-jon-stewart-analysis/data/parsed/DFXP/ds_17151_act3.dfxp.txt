(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS THE  7th SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE  UNITED NATIONS. MOST RECENTLY THE U.N. AND ARAB  LEAGUE ENVOY TO SYRIA. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED  INTERVENTIONS, A LIFE IN WAR AND  PEACE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  KOFI ANNAN. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU, SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? THANKS FOR JOINING US. THE BOOK IS CALLED  INTERVENTIONS. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. HOW'S THE WORLD?
MESSY. Jon: IT IS MESSY. IT IS MESSY. Jon: YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING  THESE EVENTS FOR A VERY LONG  TIME. WOULD YOU SAY IN YOUR ESTIMATION  ON THE KOFI ANNAN SCALE OF PEACE  IN OUR TIME TO "OH, MY GOD, RUN! "WHERE WOULD YOU SAY THE WORLD  IS RIGHT NOW?
YOU'RE CLOSE TO RUN. Jon: REALLY? MORE THAN IN PREVIOUS TIMES,  EVEN THE BOSNIAN CONFLICT,  PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN
TODAY WE HAVE SYRIA'S PROBLEM  IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE WHOLE  REGION. IF SYRIA HAS A MISCALCULATION  CAN REALLY CREATE A PROBLEM, WE  WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE. SYRIA IS DIVIDED. WE KNOW CIVIL WAR IS GOING ON. THE REGION IS DIVIDED. AND THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THAT  SUPPOSED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR  INTERNATIONAL PEACE IS ALSO  DIVIDED. THIS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO  TRY AND BRING A SOLUTION. THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN ENCOURAGING  UNITY OF THE COUNCIL, FOR THEM  TO MAKE AN EFFORT AND REALLY  WORK IN A VERY VOLATILE REGION OF THE WORLD
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. THE SECURITY COUNCIL, TWO  QUESTIONS. WHO IS TO BLAME? I WANT NAMES. (LAUGHING)  TWO, EVEN IF THEY WERE UNIFIED,  WHAT WOULD THEY DO? WHAT COULD THEY DO? COULD THEY DO ANYTHING OTHER  THAN ISSUE A PROCLAMATION TO  SYRIA TO SAY, COME ON.
I THINK THERE IS QUITE A BIT  THEY CAN DO. IF THEY WERE TO COME TOGETHER  AND BEGIN TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE  GOVERNMENT IN THE REGION TO WORK  WITH THEM, TO PRESSURE BOTH SIDES AND PUT A PROPOSAL ON THE  TABLE THAT THERE HAS TO BE A  POLITICAL TRANSITION, POLITICAL  SETTLEMENT AND REALLY GIVE THEM AN IDEA OF WHAT THAT WOULD  ENTAIL. WE TRIED TO DO THAT IN GENEVA ON  THE 30th OF JUNE WHEN WE  HELD A MEETING WHERE THE FOREIGN  MINISTERS OF THE PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE U.N. WERE THERE. SECRETARY CLINTON WAS THERE. RUSSIA, ALL OF THEM WERE THERE. WE AGREED ON PRINCIPLES AND  GUIDELINES FOR POLITICAL  SETTLEMENT WHICH I HAD EXPECTED  THEM TO COME TO NEW YORK AND  ENDORSE. IT HASN'T BEEN ENDORSED UP TO  TODAY
Jon: WHY IS RUSSIA RELUCTANT  TO ENDORSE?
I THINK ACTUALLY ON THIS ONE  THE PROBLEM WAS NOT ON THE  RUSSIAN SIDE
Jon: LET'S JUST BLAME THEM. (LAUGHING)  Jon: OBVIOUSLY THE SHOW IS ON  AMERICAN TELEVISION. I'M SURE WHEN YOU VISIT THE  RUSSIAN TV SHOW, YOU CAN LAY IT  AT OUR FEET.
WE COMPLAIN THAT THE RUSSIANS  AND THE CHINESE HAVE VETOED AND  BLOCKED US FROM TAKING ACTION
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT  BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT  SPECIFIC EFFECTIVE ACTION WE ARE  GOING TO TAKE ON THE GROUND THAT THE RUSSIANS AND THE CHINESE  BLOCKED. IF TODAY THEY WERE TO SAY, OKAY,  WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS, WHAT ARE  WE GOING TO DO? AND THIS IS THE QUESTION
Jon: OKAY. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ASKING ME, WE  HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM HERE. BUT HAVE WORLD EVENTS GOTTEN  OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF THE  LEADING POWERS OR DO WE HAVE A  MISTAKEN NOSTALGIC VIEW OF WHAT COUNTRIES WERE REALLY ABLE TO DO  AND INFLUENCE EVEN IN THE PAST? HOW DID THESE ALWAYS... HAVEN'T  THESE ALWAYS ARISEN?
I THINK YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD  THAT PROBLEM BUT DURING THE COLD  WAR THE COLD WAR, THE TRUE  POWERS COULD INFLUENCE  COUNTRIES. THERE WAS SOME CONTROL. AT THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET  UNION, THE COUNCIL BECAME A BIT  MORE HARMONIOUS AND THEY COULD  TAKE POSITIONS. SO THE U.N. AND THE  PEACE-KEEPING FORCES BEGAN BEING  INTRE DEUCED INTO CIVIL WAR  SITUATIONS
Jon: IN SOME WAYS THE  DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE REGION,  THE RISE OF DEMOCRACY, THE  COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, HAS CREATED MUCH OF THIS UNREST. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PERHAPS  LIVE WITH THE VOLATILITY UNTIL  THE NEXT WORLD WAR.
AND WHEN IS THAT GOING TO BE  Jon: BELIEVE ME, I'VE GOT  THINGS IN MIND. WILL YOU STICK AROUND SO WE CAN  TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE  BOOK AND YOUR RISE TO THE TOP OF  THE U.N. AND ALL THAT? IF YOU WOULD. I'D APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. "INTERVENTION: A LIFE IN WAR AND  PEACE" IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES  NOW. WE'LL HAVE MORE WITH KOFI ANNAN  ON THE
