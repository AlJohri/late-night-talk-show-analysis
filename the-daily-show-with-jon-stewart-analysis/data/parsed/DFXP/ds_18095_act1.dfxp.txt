Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL    NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW. YOU'RE REALLY VERY KIND. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FORMER SENATOR  KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, THE GREAT  STATE OF TEXAS AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ON GREAT WOMEN OF TEXAS. I REALLY HOPE THE COACH'S WIFE  FROM FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS IS IN  THERE BECAUSE... LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AN OLDY BUT A  GOODIE. CANDIDATE BARACK OBAMA FROM THE  YEAR 2007, THREE SIMPLE WORDS. WE DON'T SAY IT TO EACH OTHER  ENOUGH ANYMORE.
I'LL CLOSE GUANTANAMO. Jon: OH, SURE. IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT. BUT AMERICA HAS BEEN HURT  BEFORE. AND THE NEW GUY WAS REALLY  SERIOUS HE WOULD HAVE SET A  DATE. AND, MOM, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  BELIEVE IT. HE DID.
GUANTANAMO WILL BE CLOSED NO  LATER THAN ONE YEAR FROM NOW.
Jon: ONE YEAR. AND ONE YEAR LATER, OBAMA  REITERATED THIS PROMISE WITH TWO  SMALL CHANGES. SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT THEM.
MAKE NO MISTAKE. WE WILL CLOSE GUANTANAMO PRISON.
Jon: ONE. HE HAS GONE FROM I'LL CLOSE  GUANTANAMO TO WHAT'S TAKING  EVERYONE SO LONG? AND, TWO, HE HAS ADDED THE  PHRASE, "MAKE NO MISTAKE. A PHRASE USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY  BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE JUST BEEN  DEFEATED BY A SUPER HERO. AND HAVE VERY LITTLE CHAN IN THE  REMATCH. MAKE NO MISTAKE, AQUAMAN. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF ME  IN MY PLAN TO WEAPONNIZE KELP. I'LL BE BACK AND YOU'LL BE ALL  WET OR MY NAME ISN'T  DR. DISSOLVE-O. OH, WHY DID I GET IN THE WATER? I'M MADE OF... STOPWATCHING SUPER FRIENDS  DURING THE DAY. AND TURN YOUR PEN OVER IF YOU'RE  GOING TO FAKE WRITE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS FAKE WRITING. HERE'S HOW MUCH I RESPECT YOU AS  AN AUDIENCE. IN THE MIDDLE OF MY ADMITTEDLY  WELL ACTED BIT, I THOUGHT, OH,  NO, I'M WRITING WITH THE CAP. NOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY IT. NO ONE WILL BELIEVE I'M... ANYWAY, SO THAT WAS IN 2010. AND I HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT  IT SINCE THEN SO I'M JUST GOING  TO ASSUME THAT IN THAT TIME WE HAVE REGAINED OUR MORAL STATURE  AND CLOSED GUANTANAMO. CUT TO OBAMA'S PRESS CONFERENCE  YESTERDAY.
I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT  WE'VE GOT TO CLOSE GUANTANAMO.
Jon: AND IN SANTA. THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I  THINK ABOUT ONCE A YEAR AND  CONTINUE TO BELIEVE. SO WHAT ABOUT THE 166 PEOPLE WHO  ARE CURRENTLY IN PRISON IN GAWN  TON MOW IN A TWILIGHT ZONE? WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM, WE FIND  OUT IN TONIGHT'S LIMBO UPDATE. I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE  SPECIFIC WITH THE GRAPHICS  DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE TONE. SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT LIMBO WE'RE  TALKING ABOUT ALTHOUGH THE  CONTORTIONS AND EMBARRASSMENT ONE MUST GO THROUGH TO TRY TO  SNEAK UNDERNEATH THE PERPETUALLY  LOWERING BAR IS NOT ENTIRELY  WRONG. WHY IS GUANTANAMO STILL OPEN?
CONGRESS DETERMINED THAT THEY  WOULD NOT LET US CLOSE IT.
Jon: THE LEGISLATIVE STONE IN  AMERICA'S URETHRA. YES, THOSE GUYS, THEY KNOW WHAT  I'M TALKING ABOUT. SO, THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU. CONGRESS WOULD NOT LET YOU CLOSE  GUANTANAMO OR EVEN ALLOW BLANKET  TRANSFERS OF PRISONERS. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THEY DID  GRANT YOU THE AUTHORITY FOR  CASE-BY-CASE WAIVERS, NO?
EVEN AFTER CONGRESS GRANTED  IT IN 2012, THE POWER TO ISSUE  CASE-BY-CASE WAIVERS TO THOSE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS TO SEND  PEOPLE BACK TO PLACES LIKE  YEMEN, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT EXERCISED THAT AUTHORITY  ONCE.
Jon: WELL IF THERE'S ONE  THING WE AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  CAN SYMPATHIZE WITH, IT'S NOT  EXERCISING. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY DIDN'T EXERCISE THE WAIVER  ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BECAUSE  THERE'S NO PRISONERS CLEARED FOR  RELEASE. THESE GUYS ARE THE WORSE OF THE  WORSE.
ABOUT HALF THE DETAINEES'  POPULATION, 86, HAVE BEEN  CLEARED UNANIMOUSLY BY NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES FOR MORE THAN  THREE YEARS TO BE RELEASED UNTIL  SECURITY CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN  MET.
Jon: HAS ANYONE TOLD THE  PRISONERS ABOUT THIS?
A HUNGER STRIKE AT THE PRISON  IN GUANTANAMO BAY HAS EXPANDED.
Jon: THEY'VE BEEN TOLD. HOW EXPANDING IS THE HUNGER  STRIKE?
100 OF THE 166 PRISONERS AT  THE U.S. BASE IN CUBA HAVE  JOINED THE STRIKE. 19 ARE RECEIVING LIQUID  NUTRITION THROUGH A NASAL TUBE.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]. WE HAVE GONE FROM WATER BOARDING  THEM TO FOOD BOARDING THEM? AND BY THE WAY, IT'S A GOOD  THING FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  THAT THOSE PRISONERS... THEY'D HAVE P.E.T.A. ALL OVER THEIR [BLEEP]. AS THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED  YESTERDAY THERE'S A PERFECTLY  GOOD RATIONALE FOR THE FEEDING  TUBE.
IF YOU CONTINUE TO FORCE FEED  THESE FOLKS.
I DON'T WANT THESE  INDIVIDUALS TO DIE.
Jon: THIS WAS REMINDING ME OF  SOMETHING. 100-ODD PEOPLE TRAPPED ON AN  ISLAND IN A CONFUSING CONUNDRUM  WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF  ESCAPE. IT'S LIKE LOST ALL OVER AGAIN  AND JUST LIKE LOST PROBABLY  SHOULD HAVE ENDED A FEW YEARS  EARLIER. WE'LL BE RIGHT
