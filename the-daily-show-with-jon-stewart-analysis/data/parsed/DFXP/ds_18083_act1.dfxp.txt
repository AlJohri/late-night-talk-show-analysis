FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER IS  JOINING US IN WHAT I ASSUME IS A  LATE NIGHT COMEDY FIRST. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT  GUINEA WORMS. THEY ARE LIKE THE GUMMY WORM  THAT EATS YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] COMEDY GOLD! [LAUGHTER] LATELY, IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING  THE TELEVISION OR READING THE  NEWSPAPERS, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THANKS TO  DEAD LOCK IN INERTIA AND WHAT  MANY ANALYSTS ARE CALLING FATHEADEDNESS IS NOT REALLY  DOING ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO  GOVERNING, YEAH GOVERNING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE STATES ARE PICKING UP  THE SLACK. YES, THE METH LABORATORIES OF  DEMOCRACY ARE HARD AT WORK  TACKLING ALL OF OUR NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT AND PRESSING  ISSUES AS WE SEE IN OUR STATE  LAWS ROUND-UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OH, YEAH! LET'S PUT UP THE BIG BOARD! [LAUGHTER] LET'S DO IT. [ LAUGHTER. LAUGH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES, VIRGINIA AND SODOMY BECAUSE  V.A. IS FOR LOVERS OF MISSIONARY  POSITION. [LAUGHTER]
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR  GOVERNOR IN VIRGINIA HAS COME  OUT AGAINST ORAL SEX AND ANAL SEX, NOT JUST THE GAY KIND, THE  MARRIED CONSENTING ADULT VARIETY  AS WITH THE.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? WAIT, THERE'S A MARRIED ADULT  ORAL SEX VARIETY? AM I RIGHT, PEOPLE? MARRIED PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT, SNRIET SODOMY I  WOULD SETTLE FOR SOME GAMORAH AT THIS POINT. THAT GUY DOESN'T KNOW. SHE DOESN'T EITHER BUT THOSE  THREE. SERIOUSLY LOVE IS A BEAUTIFUL  INNING IN. THE WORD NEEDS MORE OF IT. GOD BLESS. GET HOME SAFER. [ LAUGHTER ] [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS WEIRD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO CURRENT VIRGINIA ATTORNEY  GENERAL KEN PUCINELL  CIRCUMSTANCES NOT A FAN OF  SODOMY. HE IS A MEAN -- PENILE  TRADITIONALIST HE LIKES HIS SEX  LIKE HIS COFFEE, HOT, BLACK AND EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HAVE NINEA. AND NOW JIMMY CARTER AND THE  GUINEA WORM. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT VIRGINIA'S SODOMY LAWS WERE  STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURT WHAT IS  KUCH DOING TO DO ABOUT IT.
HE FILED AN AFEEL KEEP  VIRGINIA'S SODOMY LAWS ON THE  BOOKS.
Jon: THAT LAW IS  REINSTATEELED. I GUESS ONLY OUTLAWS WILL GET  (bleep) JOBS. PIPE DOWN. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD GUY  IS WITH A (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] THE GUY GUYS (bleep) -- THE  GOOD GUYS (bleep) AND NOW  CURING EBOLA, THE FORMER  PRESIDENT -- CAN I TELL YOU  SOMETHING? THAT WOULD MAKE FOR AWKWARD  PRISON CELL MATE CONVERSATION. WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?
SODOMY.
REALLY? [LAUGHTER] INTERESTING. I'M IN FOR -- I MEAN TAX FRAUD. HE WANTS TO USE THE SODOMY LAWS  AS A LOOPHOLE TO PROSECUTE  SOMEONE WHO HAD SEX WITH A  MINOR. WHILE SODOMY IS TECHNICALLY  ILLEGAL UNDER VIRGINIA LAW SEX  WITH A 15-YEAR-OLD IS FINE. IT'S A COMPLICATED --
KUCHINELLI'S NICKNAME IS THE  KUCH. I'LL PAUSE FOR A MINUTE WHILE  YOU MAKE AN INAPPROPRIATE JOKE.
Jon: OH, I'M GOING MAKE A  VAGINA JOKE. GROW UP, LADY. WHAT IS NEXT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] KANSAS ARKANSAS AND NORTH  DAKOTA. THAT'S A RED STATE TRY FECTA.
ARKANSAS NOW HAS THE TOUGHEST  ANTI-ABORTION LAW IN THE COUNTRY  ON THE BOOKS BANNING ABORTIONS AFTEREL 12th WEEK.
NORTH DAKOTA BAN AS ABORTIONS  AS EARLY AS FOUR WEEKS.
KANSAS CONCLUDED THAT LIFE  BEGINS AT FERTILIZATION.
Jon: KENTUCKY SAYS LIFE  BEGINS WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN'S  HANDS ACCIDENTALLY TOUCH WHEN REACHING FOR THE FRIES AT THE  DENNY'S. I JUST WANTED TO SELL IT. THE STATES ARE SAYING YOU HAVE  TO HAVE THE BABY MAKING SEX AND  YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RESULTING  BABY. ANY STATE LAWS THAT MIGHT COVER  WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AFTERWARDS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S HEAD OUT TO THE VOLUNTEER  STATE.
WE'LL GO TO TENNESSEE AND  TELL BUT A STATE SENATOR BY THE  NAME OF STACY CAMPFIELD. HE DOESN'T HAVE CHILDREN BUT HE  HAS AN IDEA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: GO ON. [ LAUGHTER ]
IF YOUR KIDS DON'T GET GOOD  GRADES, IN OTHER WORDS DON'T  PASS, THEY WOULD CUT YOUR WELFARE BENEFITS 30%. [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Jon: MOOCHERS. LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET THIS  STRAIGHT. LITTLE BILLY IS POOR. HE IS NOT DOING VERY WELL IN  SCHOOL. I HAVE AN IDEA, WHAT IF WE MADE  HIM POORER? [LAUGHTER] AND TOLD HIS FAMILY IT WAS HIS  FAILT. [ LAUGHTER ] HUH? LAST SEMESTER MY GRADES WERE BAD  BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY AND COLDER  BUT THIS SEMESTER I'M HUNGRIER AND COLDER AND MY FAMILY ISN'T  TALKING TO ME SO BRING ON THE  LONG DIVISION. [ LAUGHTER ] IS STACY CAMPFIELD A STATE  SENATOR OR A VILLAGE FROM A  DICKENS NOVEL? BUT I GUESS FROM THE STATE OF  TENNESSEE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GUESS FROM THE STATE OF  TENNESSEE -- TENNESSEE JUST  STANDING PEOPLE YOU KNOW.9,000 A MONTH THEY SHOULD HAVE SAY.
THE CURRENT SYSTEM GIVES  FAMILIES UP TO $189 FOR WELFARE  ASSISTANCE.
Jon: BECAUSE $190 WOULD  SPOIL THEM. WHO IS THIS STATE LEGISLATOR WHO  WANTS TO TURN TENNESSEE  EDUCATION INTO THE ACTUAL HUNGER  GAME?
THIS COMMENT FROM TENNESSEE  STATE SENATOR STACY CAMPFIELD IN  A SERIOUS RADIO INTERVIEW RAISED EYEBROWS HE SAID AIDS WAS  TRANSMITTED TO HUMANS BECAUSE  ONE GUY HAD SEX WITH A MONKEY AND THEN STARTED HAVING SEX WITH  MEN. [AUDIENCE BOOS]

I'M NOT EXPECTING THE KIDS TO  WRITE THE MAGNA CARTA. ABC'S, 123'S I BELIEVE ANY  PARENT COULD DO THAT.
Jon: YOU BELIEVE AIDS BEGAN  WHEN A GUY HAD SEX WITH A  MONKEY. THAT HAS TO BE WORTH 40% OF YOUR  SALARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND YOU DO KNOW KIDS WHO DEPEND  ON WELFARE ARE NOT THE ONLY  SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF STATE FUNDING. PENALIZE EVERYONE WHO BENEFITS  IN SOME WAY FROM TAXED MONEY. I'M TIRED OF MY MONEY GOING TO  POLICE DEPARTMENTS. HEY 911, WHAT IS THAT HIS LAST  MATH TEST? I THINK IT WAS A
