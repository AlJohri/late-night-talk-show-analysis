I MEAN, I DID NOT EXPECT THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ALL THE STUFF OUT OF THE GREEN ROOM AND THEN BRING IT OUT HERE AS THOUGH IT WAS A GIFT, AND I JUST THANK YOU BECAUSE THAT WAS REALLY... THAT WAS LIKE WOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHTFUL. SO THANK YOU.
THE LEAST WE COULD DO.

YEAH, NO, NO, NO. I GET THAT. THAT WAS REALLY NICE.
AND WE ASKED, WHICH ARE YOUR FAVORITE ITEMS.
Jon: I LOVE, I ALWAYS SAY, OH, MY GOD, THE PLACE WHERE THE STRAWS ARE.
DO YOU LIKE GLOBE?
Jon: I LOOKED AT IT AND I WAS LIKE, OH, THAT'S MINE, THAT'S ALREADY MINE. I REMEMBER THINKING THAT. AND I WAS THINKING, IT'S SO NICE OF STEVE TO BRING IT OUT HERE SO I CAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO PUT ALL THIS [BLEEPED] AWAY. THANKS A LOT, GUYS. THAT'S TERRIFIC. I OBVIOUSLY IT WAS SORT OF A SURPRISE THAT YOU WERE ALL COMING. WE WERE EXCITED. WE WERE DELIGHTED.

SO DELICIOUS. THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY WELCOME, AND ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR ALL MY STUFF. [LAUGHTER] SO LET ME JUST TALK TO YOU. SO DISH THE DIRT ON YOUR CO-STARS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
Jon: I HEAR FERRELL'S A BIT OF A DRUNKEN PRICK ON SET.
TRUE.
Jon: I HEAR KOECHNER IS JUST AN AVID PORN FANATIC.
HE LOVES PORN, AND HE LIKES WATCHING IT ON PLANES. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TRAVELING TOGETHER, SO HE'LL WATCH IT ON PLANES, TOO. IT'S REALLY DISTURBING.
Jon: I CAN'T WAIT TO ASK HIM ABOUT IT. UM, PAUL RUDD IS NOT AGING IN A NORMAL HUMAN WAY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR THE REST OF US TIME MARCHES INEXORABLY ON, AND YET HE HAS SOME COMBINATION OF YOGA OR NAZI BLOOD HAS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN A YOUTHFUL VIGOR THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IF I KILL HIM I BECOME HIM.
THAT'S TRUE. AND IF YOU... YOU COULD CUT OFF HIS FACE AND APPLY IT TO YOUR FACE, AND THOSE HEALING NUTRIENTS.
Jon: REALLY?
IT'S LIKE OSMOSIS.
Jon:, WHEN I SEE HIM, I'M GOING TO CUT THAT [BLEEPED] FACE OFF.
I THINK YOU SHOULD.
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO SIT IN THAT CHAIR.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU GENTLEMEN DOING? NICELY DONE. THE BID IS OVER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU'LL ALL GET A TURN IN THE BIG MAN'S SEAT. HEY, HEY, I WASN'T KIDDING ABOUT THAT. THAT'S REAL. SON OF A BITCH. GET IT OUT. YOU SON OF A BITCH. [BLEEPED] [BLEEPED] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [BLEEPED] [BLEEPED] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
DON'T DO IT. DON'T DO IT.
Jon: THAT'S MINE! THAT IS MINE! NO! NOOOOOOO! IT'S ALL RUINED. YOU MANIAC! "ANCHORMAN 2: THE LEGEND CONTINUES" IS IN THEATERS NOW.
