( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT FORMER UNITED  STATES SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF  MAINE. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED FIGHTING  COMMON GROUND. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  OLYMPIA SNOWE. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU.
WOW. BIG AUDIENCE. WOW.
Jon: THEY'RE A FINE, FINE  GROUP OF PROUD AMERICANS.
GREAT TO BE HERE  Jon: IT IS NICE TO BE HERE. A VERY POPULAR SHOW.
IT IS  Jon: HERE'S THE BOOK RIGHT  HERE. FIGHTING FOR COMMON GROUND. HOW TO GET THE STALEMATE OUT OF  CONGRESS. YOU KNOW WHAT IS SO INTERESTING  TO ME? THIS BOOK IS ALWAYS WRITTEN BY  SENATORS AFTER THEY LEAVE THE  SENATE. WHENEVER THEY LEAVE THE SENATE  THEY ALWAYS GO, YOU KNOW WHAT  THOSE GUYS SHOULD DO?
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL  THEM THAT FOREVER.
Jon: WHY IS IT SO HARD TO DO  WHEN YOU'RE THERE?
WELL, I DO. I TALK TO MY COLLEAGUES. WHAT I SAY IN THE BOOK IS  NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I  WOULD SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES, EVEN TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES. BUT ACTUALLY I DIDN'T EVEN  INTEND TO WRITE A BOOK WHEN I  MADE MY DECISION NOT TO SEEK  RE-ELECTION. BUT SOME PEOPLE SUGGESTED IT. AND TO LAY IT OUT THERE ONTO  HAVE IT COME OUT AT THIS PERIOD  OF TIME WHICH IS CRITICAL TO THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THIS IS THE  MOMENT IN CONGRESS WHERE THE  PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS  SUPPOSEDLY...
Jon: NOTHING IS GOING TO  HAPPEN NOW. WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING  NOW...
YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT? Jon: YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE  OF IMPEACHMENT THAN BACKGROUND  CHECKS RIGHT NOW. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. YOU WERE THERE. THIS IS THE THING THAT I CAN'T  WRAP MY HEAD AROUND. IN 2009 YOU GUYS HAVE A RETREAT. AND YOU'RE IN THE LIBRARY OF  CONGRESS. AND I GUESS IT'S IN THE RETREAT  ROOM. THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
THE RETREAT ROOM? NOT LITERALLY
Jon: WHEREVER THEY HAVE THE  SNACKS.
THAT'S RIGHT. Jon: WHEREVER THEY KEEP THE  COOKING BOOKS. THERE. MITCH McCONNELL STANDS UP AND  SAYS WE WILL DENY THIS PRESIDENT  BIPARTISANSHIP. WE WILL NOT GIVE HIM THAT. NOT WE WILL LOOK FOR LEGISLATION  THAT BEST SERVES THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. WE WILL DENY THIS MAN ANY  BIPARTISANSHIP. DOES ANYONE RAISE THEIR HAND AND  GO, THAT SEEMS PETTY? WHAT HAPPENS THERE?
WELL, AS YOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T  UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN ON... I  MEAN IT DID HAPPEN ON  BIPARTISANSHIP. NO ONE WORKED ON BOTH SIDES  EXCEPT A FEW OF US. THE STIMULUS WAS THE BEGINNING  OF THAT PROCESS IN 2009. ONLY THREE OF US ENDED UP VOTING  FOR IT. BY WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, THE WHEELS CAME OFF SO  SOON IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND  WITH CONGRESS. WHICH WAS STUNNING AND  SURPRISING FRANKLY.
Jon: IT'S SURPRISING WHEN  THERE'S A MEETING, WHEN THEY  LITERALLY SIT AND GO, WE WILL NOT WORK TOGETHER. IS THAT NOT SURPRISING? THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF  SURPRISING WHEN YOU GO, WELL,  THAT WAS OUR PLAN. THAT WORKED.
WELL, YOU KNOW, ON ONE HAND  TO SAY IT. IT'S QUITE ANOTHER TO FULFILL IT
Jon: BUT THEY DID FULFILL IT. I KNOW. PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES SAY A LOT  OF THINGS BUT YOU GET PAST THAT  AND YOU WORK TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT SHOULD HAVE  HAPPENED. THAT'S WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THAT'S TRAGIC
Jon: WHAT'S THE PUSHBACK  LIKE?
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PUSHBACK. I'M ALWAYS PUSHING BACK.
Jon: THEY DID NOT CARE FOR  YOU?
NO. LITERALLY ON THE FRONT LINES  EVERYDAY. THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, I WAS  CALLED A DINOSAUR AND A R.I.N.O.
Jon: THESE GUYS GET THERE,  YOU GET MANCHIN FROM WEST  VIRGINIA AND TOO MANIY FROM WHEREVER THE HELL THAT GUY IS  FROM.
PENNSYLVANIA  Jon: THEY GHETTOING AND DO A  BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECK  AMENDMENT. THEY SAY THEY'VE GOT 70 SENATORS  LINED UP. THE N.R.A. SAYS THEY'RE GOING TO  SCORE IT. THAT DROPS TO 54. 54 IS STILL A MAJORITY. IT GETS DEFEATED BECAUSE OF THE  SILLINESS OF THE FILIBUSTER.
BUT LET'S GO BACK. 90% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  SUPPORTED THAT INITIATIVE,  RIGHT?
Jon: YES. OKAY. AND SO 10% OPPOSED IT. WAS THE 10% LOUDER THAN THE 90%? THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WE'VE ALL GOT TO SPEAK UP. THAT'S WHY MAKING SURE THIS...
Jon: YOU DON'T PEOPLE SPOKE  UP ABOUT BACKGROUND CHECKS?
NO. CALLING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND  MAKING SURE THEY HEAR FROM THOSE  90%.
Jon: THEY DON'T ANSWER OUR  CALL. THEY ONLY ANSWER THE N.R.A.'S. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE. THAT'S WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE SO THAT  YOU CAN REINFORCE THOSE VOICES  AND BACK THEM UP. YOU HAD A RALLY "RESTORE  SANITY."
Jon: YEAH, THAT WORKED. THAT LASTED 15 MINUTES.
JON, DO IT AGAIN. WOULD YOU ALL CALL YOUR MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: REPRESENTATIVE  GOVERNMENT THAT HAS 90% SUPPORT  FOR AN ISSUE AND 70 SENATORS THAT WOULD DO IT IF NOT ONE FOR  LOBBYING GROUP'S OBJECTIONS  SHOULDN'T HAVE TO READ A BOOK AND CALL PEOPLE TO GET THAT  DONE. THAT'S A BROKEN SYSTEM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I AGREE WITH YOU. Jon: WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A  COMMERCIAL BREAK. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE  A.R.B. STUFF. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING. YOU, MY FINE FRIEND, WROTE THE  A.R.B. LEGISLATION. SHE IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT  GOT ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW BOARDS  IN PLACE. IT SOMETHING THAT TURNED OUT TO  BE VERY HELPFUL. WE'LL BE BACK AND
