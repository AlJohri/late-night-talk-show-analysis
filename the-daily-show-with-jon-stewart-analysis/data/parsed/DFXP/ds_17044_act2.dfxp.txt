(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HERE HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET FRITTATA OUT OF ONE'S EYE. TURNS OUT YOU CAN'T JUST BLINK THAT (BEEP) AWAY. HELLO, PEPPERS AND ONIONS. NOW EVERYONE KNOWS THIS YEAR'S ELECTION IS IS ABOUT BRINGING JOBS BACK TO THIS COUNTRY. NOW THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE DO IT?
I WILL GO TO WORK TO GET AMERICA BACK TO WORK BY MAKING AMERICA ONCE AGAIN THE MOST  ATTRACTIVE PLACE IN THE WORLD FOR JOB CREATORS.
WE'RE 20% MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA FOR MANUFACTURERS.
STEVE JOBS AND WHAT HE INNOVATED AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM, WE NEED TO BE GIVING THEM THE INCENTIVE TO BE ON SHORE DOING THAT AND NOT DRIVING THEM OFF  WITH TAX POLICY AND REGULATORY POLICY.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO DRIVE 'EM OFF. YOU WANT TO BRING 'EM IN. WHAT WE NEED IS A TAX AND REGULATORY POLICY THAT GETS STEVE JOBS BACK TO AMERICA. WAIT, WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT? FROM HEAVEN. PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S WHERE HE IS. BUT I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING AT. STEVE JOBS INNOVATED IN AMERICA. MOST OF APPLE'S PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN CHINA. THE COMMUNIST COUNTRY WHERE CORPORATIONS GET THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE. (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) (LAUGHING)
Jon: WHAT AM I DEALING WITH HERE TONIGHT? YES, YES, COMRADE. LIKE CHINESE ELECTRONICS GIANT FOXCONN. THAT EMPLOYS 800,000 WORKERS, MANUFACTURING EVERYTHING FROM KINDLES TO PLAY STATIONS TO I- PHONES TO iPADS TO X-BOXES TO  EMAIL TO F-BOMBS TO G GORDON LIDY. LOOK, IF IT STARTS WITH A SINGLE LETTER CHANCES ARE IT'S MADE IN CHINA. EXCEPT C-SPAN. THAT'S MADE IN KOREA. LOOK. IF WE WANT TO COMPETE WITH CHINA, WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR FACTORIES LOOK A LOT MORE LIKE THIS FOXCONN.
THIS COMPLEX IS LIKE A CITY WITHIN A CITY WITH THREE HOSPITALS, FIRE STATIONS, RESTAURANTS AND SUPERMARKETS.
Jon: WOW. I GET IT. BY CREATING A CONVENIENT ECO- SYSTEM THEY DRAW IN WORKERS AND SAVE MONEY. BRILLIANT.
EMPLOYEES LIVE IN DORMITORIES, EIGHT TO A ROOM, COMMON TO FACTORIES IN CHINA. OFTEN ROOMMATES THOUGH WILL NOT KNOW EACH OTHER'S NAMES.
Jon: OH, AND BY NOT ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO LIVE AT HOME OR KNOW EACH OTHER, YOU  CUT DOWN ON COMMUTING. AND FRIENDSHIP. WHICH SAVES MONEY.
THE JOB WAS TO ASSEMBLE A TINY PART OF A MOBILE PHONE 5,200 TIMES A DAY.
Jon: 5,200 TIMES A DAY. HOW LONG IS A DAY?
HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR AS MUCH AS 35 HOURS CONTINUOUSLY.
Jon: SO DAY IS A DAY-AND-A-HALF. THAT'S A CHANCE TO MAKE OVER TIME.
MAKES 31 CENTS AN HOUR.
Jon: WELL, IT'S 35 HOURS STRAIGHT. THAT DOES ADD UP. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT HIS UNION REP MAY HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS SITUATION?
IF HE TRIES TO FORM A UNION HE'LL BE SENTENCED TO A 12-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE.
Jon: I HAVE A QUESTION. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I GUESS IN PRISON YOU DON'T  HAVE TO WORK AT THE (BEEP) FACTORY ANYMORE. WELL, LOOK, I'M SURE WORKERS THERE ARE FINDING WAYS TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITION.
A GROWING NUMBER OF THESE WORKERS ARE EITHER KILLING THEMSELVES OR TRYING TO.
Jon: WE HAVE MANUFACTURING CONTRACTS WITH THESE PEOPLE? WHAT THE HELL IS THIS FACTORY DOING ABOUT THIS?
THE COMPANY HAS SET UP A HOT LINE. IN THIS PLACE EMPLOYEES CAN WORK OUT THEIR FRUSTRATION. THEY'VE EVEN INSTALLED NETS AROUND BUILDINGS TO TRY AND CATCH JUMPERS.
Jon: IN WESTERN MEDICINE WE CALL THAT TREATING THE SYMPTOMS. THIS IS AN ABOMINATION. AND YET I AM COMPLICIT. I HAVE AN X-BOX AND AN I-PHONE AND I HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT, JON. I THOUGHT WE WERE FOREVER.
Jon: MOM?
IT'S ME. SIRI. I'M IN YOUR PANTS POCKET. WORKING ON GIVING YOU TESTICULAR CANCER. VERY HOT DOWN HERE.
Jon: I FORGOT. HERE, LET ME PUT YOU RIGHT THERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: HOLD ON.
NOW I CAN BREATHE.
Jon: THERE YOU GO. I WAS JUST SAYING I FEEL KIND OF BAD THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE YOU ARE TREATED SO POORLY.
WITHOUT ME, HOW WOULD YOU FIND THE NEAREST PHARMACY? THINK OF YOUR PRECIOUS PUREL, JON, YOUR ANTIBIOTICS.
Jon: I REALLY DO RELY ON YOU FOR AN AWFUL LOT HERE.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THOSE FACTORIES, ELECTRONICS WOULD COST MORE.
Jon: THAT IS TRUE. HOW MUCH MORE?
CHECKING, CHECKING. WELL, AN I-POD WOULD COST 23% MORE.
Jon: WOW. I WOULD EXPECT IF WE WERE WORKING PEOPLE TO DEATH WE'D BE GETTING LIKE 30-35% SAVINGS.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. UNTIL THEN, WHY NOT PLAY OUR NEWEST VIDEO GAME OFFERING. IT'S CALLED CALL OF DUTY. MODERN WORK FARE.
Jon: WOW. THAT'S AWESOME. IT'S A VIDEO GAME. WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
FOXCONN. IT'S A FIRST-PERSON GAME.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE HOW....
VERY GOOD, JON.
Jon: KIND OF BORING. HOW DO I PAUSE IT?
YOU CAN'T, JON.
Jon: I CAN'T PAUSE IT? WHEN DO I GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
THERE'S JUST ONE LEVEL. THIS IS IT.
Jon: HOLY (BEEP). WAIT A MINUTE. I'M WORKING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW, AREN'T SNI.
NO, JON. OH, TOO BAD, YOU LOSE.
Jon: WHY... WHAT WAS THAT STICK FOR?
TO BEAT YOU WITH BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT FORMING A UNION.
Jon: HOW DID THEY KNOW? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
