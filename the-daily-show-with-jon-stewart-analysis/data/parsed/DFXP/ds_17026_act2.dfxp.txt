(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SHOCKING POLITICAL NEWS YESTERDAY.
AS EXPECTED, BARNEY FRANK, A CONGRESSMAN IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR  OVER THREE DECADES ANNOUNCING HIS RETIREMENT TODAY, SUDDENLY.
Jon: QUITTER! HE ONLY SERVED 16 TERMS. OR AS IT'S KNOWN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE FRESHMAN 32. (LAUGHTER) HE'S LEAVING SO EARLY HE HASN'T DEVELOPED A CHARLIE RANGEL FRONT  AUDIENCE REACTS)( I TRULY HOPE THAT THAT'S AIR. OR TED STEVENS' ANGER MANAGEMENT PROBLEM.
NO!
THAT GUY WAS IN THE SENATE FOR 114 YEARS. SECOND LONG NEST HISTORY. NO ONE LEAVES CONGRESS VOLUNTARILY. CERTAINLY NOT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON, SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE UP.
I WAS PLANNING TO RUN AGAIN AND THEN THE CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING CAME. THE FACT THAT IT'S SO NEW MAKES IT HARDENER TERMS OF LEARNING ABOUT NEW AREAS, INTRODUCING  MYSELF TO NEW PEOPLE. SO I WOULD HAVE HAD THIS VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN WHICH I WOULD BE GOING TO PEOPLE IN  ATTLEBOROUGH, BELLINGHAM AND OVER AREAS AND SAYING "PLEASE, LET ME BE YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND LET ME WORK ON YOUR PROBLEMS. ".
Jon: SO HIS REASON FOR STEPPING DOWN IS THAT IF HE DID RUN IN 2012 HE WOULD FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN 20 20-YEARS HAVE TO MAKE HIMSELF APPEALING TO VOTERS. THE NEWS OF HIS DEPARTURE WAS GREETED WITH RESPECT TO HIS SERVICE FOR THE COUNTRY.
SAY GOOD-BYE TO BARNEY FRANK.
HE SAW THE WRITING ON THE WALL. HE'S GONE.
WILL BARNEY FRANK'S DEPARTURE BE A BOOST FOR THE ECONOMY? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE CROWING ABOUT. LOSING BARNEY FRANK IS THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO CONSERVATIVES. HE'S THE PERFECT AVATAR OF EVERYTHING THEY HATE: GAY, JEWISH, TAXACHUSETTS, ARROGANT, CONDESCENDING LIBERAL. HE'S YOUR EVERYTHING BAGEL.
IF YOU WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL, I WANT TO SECOND WHAT MICHELLE SAID. YOU OUGHT TO START WITH BARNEY FRANK.
THERE'S NO MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO MISTREATS OTHER HUMAN BEINGS  PERSONALLY MORE CONSISTENTLY AND HARSHLY THAN BARNEY FRANK.
THE SLIMIEST OF THE SLIME.
HE'S CORRUPT.
BARNEY FRANK IS AN IDIOT!
BARNEY FRANK. ALL HE DID WAS RUN A GAY PROSTITUTION RING OUT OF HIS HOUSE OFFICE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS LOVED JOB CREATORS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO DO. BARNEY FRANK LEAVES THE HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE WHO DO YOU THINK WILL REPLACE HIM THAT THEY  CAN BEAT UP HALF AS GLEEFULLY.
HE COULD BE REPLACED BY MAXINE WATERS.
Jon: THAT COULD WORK FOR YOU. MAXINE WATERS FOR HELPING BANK HER HUSBAND OWNS STOCK IN. THIS MAXINE WATERS?
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE TEA PARTY G K GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THE KEENING IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN.
