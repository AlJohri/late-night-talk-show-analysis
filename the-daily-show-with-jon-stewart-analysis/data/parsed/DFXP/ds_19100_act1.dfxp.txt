FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. GUEST TONIGHT PETER SCHUCK. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF "WHY GOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT." BUT FIRST, AS WE ALL KNOW EVER SINCE THEY VERY INNOCENTLY CRASHED OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY THROUGH PURPOSEFUL AND FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES -- [LAUGHTER] -- BANKS AND THE BANKERS WHO BANK THEM -- [LAUGHTER] -- HAVE WEATHERED ATTACKS FROM ALL CORNERS.
THE GOVERNMENT IS WAGING WAR ON BANKS.
THEY SAY THAT WALL STREET IS GUILTY THAT YOUR FORTUNES ARE WHERE THEY ARE NOW BECAUSE OF THE GREED ON WALL STREET.
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE GUYS IN A PERP WALK, THEY WANT TO SEE BANKERS IN HANDCUFFS GOING TO PRISON.
Jon: IT'S AS THOUGH SEEING THEM PUNISHED APPROPRIATELY WOULD BE SOMEHOW JUST OR RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, GUESS WHAT? THE VAMPIRES FINALLY GOT THEIR BLOOD.
HIS NAME IS KAREEM SERAGELDIN AND HIS TRADERS LIED ABOUT THE VALUE OF HIS MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES AND HE KNEW ABOUT THAT AND HE SORT OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY, AND SO HE WAS GUILTY.
Jon: HUH. LYING ABOUT THE VALUE OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND LOOKING THE OTHER WAY I THINK WAS THE SLOGAN FOR ONE OF THOSE COMPANIES, WASN'T IT? WHY IS HE THE ONLY PERSON TO HAVE GONE TO JAIL FOR THAT ACTIVITY?
HE PLED GUILTY AND HE IS NOW IN PRISON.
Jon: OH, HE WANT TO JAIL FOR STUPIDITY. DOESN'T HE KNOW, PLEADING GUILTY IS NOT HOW YOU ADDRESS THOSE VERY COMMON CHARGES.
JP MORGAN IS PAYING $410 MILLION TO SETTLE CHARGES WITH THE GOVERNMENT BUT JP MORGAN IS NOT ADMITTING ANY WRONGDOING.
GOLDMAN SACHS SETTLED EARLY ON IN THIS CASE FOR $550 MILLION WITHOUT ADMITTING WRONGDOING.
UBS HAS AGREED TO PAY ABOUT $50 MILLION. UNDER THE TERMS OF SETTLEMENT UBS DID NOT ADMIT ANY WRONGDOING.
Jon: THAT'S HOW WE DO. [LAUGHTER] YOU SAY WHEN YOU ARE CAUGHT, WHILE I CLEARLY HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG, I KNOW YOU ARE A BUSY MAN AND YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE SO HERE IS A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOUR TROUBLES, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? GET THE GOVERNMENT'S WIFE SOMETHING NICE, MAYBE A TENNIS BRACELET. HEY, GABBAGOUL. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AS WALL STREET SUFFERS, THE REAL PERPETRATORS OF FINANCIAL DISTRICT WRONGDOING CONTINUE TO PAY NO PRICE. I'M TALKING ABOUT OCCUPY WALL STREET. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. MIC CHECK. I'M TALKING. I'M TALKING. ABOUT OCCUPY -- ABOUT OCCUPY, WALL STREET, WALL STREET. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY YOU ARE GOING TO (bleep) DO THAT, REALLY? THEY REALLY DID BECOME THE PEOPLES MICROPHONE. YOU KNOW, THESE OCCUPY WALL STREETERS AFTER VICTIMIZING WALL STREET JOB CREATORS BY DRUMMING IN THEIR GENERAL VICINITY, BY WAGGLING THEIR FINGERS IN A THREATENING MANNER OR BY RUDELY CORNERING THE PEPPER SPRAY MARKET WITH THEIR FACES. THE OCCUPIERS HAVE GOTTEN OFF SCOTT FREE. EXCEPT FOR, OBVIOUSLY, THE MASS ARRESTS AND PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED PEPPER SPRAY. MY POINT IS NOT ONE OCCUPIER HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO LONG-TERM PRISON TIME. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S STILL -- [LAUGHTER] -- WALL STREET. ONE GUY IN JAIL. OCCUPY -- [LAUGHTER] -- UNTIL YESTERDAY.
AN OCCUPY WALL STREET ACTIVIST WHOSE ARREST WENT VIRAL, CECILY MCMILLAN, FACING UP TO SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON.
Jon: WOO! AN OCCUPIER HAS FINALLY BEEN SENT TO JAIL. THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG. BUT IT BENDS TO MOTHER (bleep) JUSTICE. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S -- IT'S 1-1. WHAT CRIME DID THIS OCCUPY PROTESTER COMMIT? I BET THEY SERVED GLUTEN AT THE GLUTEN FREE TABLE OR SHELVED CHOMSKEY BEFORE ZINN IN THE FREE LIBRARY. EVERYBODY KNOWS C COMES AFTER Z BECAUSE ALPHABETICAL ORDER IS A SYSTEM OF HETERO-PATRIARCH NORMATIVITY -- I'M BEING TOLD THAT MY MAN-SPLAINING FAILED TO CHECK MY PRIVILEGE. I BET IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER BACK IN 2012 AND IT WAS ALL CAUGHT ON VIDEO.
Jon: OKAY, YEAH YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THEY'LL DEFINITELY ARREST YOU FOR THAT. AND BY THE WAY, DON'T THINK THAT THE POLICE DIDN'T ALSO GET IN TROUBLE WHEN THEY ASSAULTED PROTESTERS, TOO. REMEMBER THIS GUY, THE NYPD OFFICER ANTHONY BOLOGNA AKA TONY BALONEY WHO PEPPERED PROTESTERS WITH ENTHUSIASM RARELY SEEN OUTSIDE OF CHIPOTLE. HE WAS PUNISHED, TOO. HE LOST SOME VACATION DAYS AND GOT REASSIGNED TO STATEN ISLAND, WHERE HE IS FROM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO NOT SO MUCH A SENTENCE AS BEING RELEASED BACK INTO TO HIS NATURAL HABITAT. SORT OF LIKE THE END OF FREE WILLY. YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY LIKE TONY BALONEY, I MEAN, HE COULDN'T BE MORE AT HOME IN STATEN ISLAND UNLESS HIS NAME WAS JIMMY PEPPERONI HEY, I'M WALKING OVER HERE. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR FVU CORRESPONDENT SAM BEE. SHE'S ON WALL STREET RIGHT NOW. SAM, THANKS FOR JOINING US. SAM,
YEAH, YES JON.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, I'VE NEVER SEEN THE ACRONYM BEFORE. FVU. I WORK HERE; I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS.
IT'S THE FINANCIAL VICTIMS UNIT, JON. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT WAS WEIRD, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
THAT WAS MY DRAMATIC STING. HEY, LISTEN, JON, I'M DOWN HERE ON WALL STREET WHERE EVERYONE IS BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF NOW THAT CECILY MCMILLAN AKA THE MENACE IS FINALLY OFF THE STREETS.
Jon: WELL, THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE WALL STREETERS TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS OUT THERE AND CAPABLE OF LETTING THEM KNOW FROM ACROSS THE STREET HOW MUCH SHE DISAPPROVED OF THEM.
JON, YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT. BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF CRIMINALS LIKE MS. McMILLEN A LOT OF HIGH RANKING BANK EXECUTIVES LOST THEIR HOMES.
Jon: THEY REALLY DID LOSE THEIR HOME?
YEAH, WELL THEIR PIED-A-TERRES. AND THEY DIDN'T REALLY LOSE THEM, THEY JUST COULDN'T USE THEM OR A COUPLE OF NIGHTS WHAT WITH THE DRUMMING AND -- MANY OF BANKERS ARE STILL IN RECOVERY AFTER YEARS OF SUFFERING FROM PTID.
Jon: PTID?
POST TRAUMATIC INCONVENIENCE DISORDER. [LAUGHTER] BUT IF JUSTICE IS TO TRULY BE SERVED WE ALSO HAVE TO FIX THIS TERRIBLE INEQUALITY.
Jon: WHAT IS THE INEQUALITY HERE, SAM?
PUT YOUR GLASSES ON, OLD MAN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THESE JAIL TERMS ARE FALLING DISPROPORTIONATELY ON THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.
Jon: NO THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S ACTUALLY EXACTLY EVEN, IT'S EXACTLY EVEN FOR THE ENTIRE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. ONE WALL STREETER WENT TO JAIL AND ONE OCCUPIER WENT TO JAIL. SO, EVEN STEVEN, I GUESS WOULD YOU SAY.
I'M SORRY, JON. WASN'T THIS ABOUT THE 99% AGAINST THE 1%. THAT MEANS THAT ONE BANKER IS WORTH 99 PROTESTERS. BY MY COUNT THAT PUTS US 98 CONVICTED HIPPIES SHORT OF TRUE JUSTICE. STING ME.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SAM. SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
