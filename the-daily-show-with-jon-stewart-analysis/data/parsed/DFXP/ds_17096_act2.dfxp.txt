(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. IF THERE'S ANYTHING MORE AWKWARD THAN SEX IT'S THE WAY ANYBODY ELSE HAS SEX BRINGING  US TO OUR LATEST INSTALLMENT OF "GAYWATCH." FIRST STOP THE WHITE HOUSE  WHERE THE PRESIDENT SEEMS INTENT ON SQUANDERING THE GOOD WILL GAINED ON DON'T ASK DON'T TELL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS UNDER FIRE FOR REFUSING TO SIGN A FEDERAL ORDER.
Jon: OH, SNAP. OBAMA, YOU JUST GOT THE WHITE HOUSE GLITTER BOMB. ON A WHITE SURFACE, THAT IS NEVER COMING OFF. WHAT'S OBAMA'S EXCUSE FOR THIS?
THE PRESIDENT IS DEDICATED TO SECURING EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL L.G.B.T. AMERICANS. OUR HOPE IS THESE EFFORTS WILL REPORT IN A PASSAGE OF THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION  ACT WHICH IS A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION TO L.G.B.T. EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION.
Jon: YOU JUST NEED TO GET THAT PASS THROUGH THE CONGRESS. YOU PREFER A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. NOT A BIG FAN OF WAITING AROUND FOR A DYSFUNCTIONAL CONGRESS TO DO ITS JOB.
WE CAN'T WAIT FOR AN INCREASINGLY DYSFUNCTIONAL CONGRESS TO DO ITS JOB.
Jon: TOLD YOU, CARNEY. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T HEAR HIM SAY IT. YOU PROBABLY JUST READ WHAT IT SAID AND THOUGHT, OH, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR A CONGRESS TO DO ITS JOB.
WHERE THEY WON'T ACT, I WILL. I'VE TOLD MY ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP LOOKING EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE  WITHOUT CONGRESS.
Jon: I FOUND ONE. HOW ABOUT YOU SIGN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD PROTECT GAY PEOPLE IN THE WORKPLACE.
THE APPROACH WE'RE TAKING AT THIS TIME IS TO TRY TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR PASSAGE OF  THIS LEGISLATION. A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO LEGISLATE ON THE ISSUE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION.
Jon: I GET IT. GO (BEEP) YOURSELVES. GUESS WHAT. THE STATE... THERE'S GAY RIGHTS LEGISLATION PENDING IN NORTH CAROLINA.
RESIDENTS WILL SAY YEAH OR NAY ON A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD DEFINE  MARRIAGE AS BEING BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.
ALTHOUGH ALREADY ILLEGAL IN THE STATE GAY MARRIAGE IF PASSED WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL  IN THE CONSTITUTION.
Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE HOW WEAK STRAIGHT MARRIAGE WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA. MAYBE I DID. MAYBE I DID. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.... ( APPLAUSE ) ... I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS NEW AMENDMENT CHANGES THAT. IT'S LIKE WEARING SUSPENDERS AND A BELT AND SEWING UP YOUR ZIPPER TO MAKE SURE NO ONE  BLOWS YOU. WHILE GAYS HAVE BEEN LET DOWN BY POLITICIANS... YOU LIKE THAT? YEAH, YEAH. YEAH. WHILE GAYS HAVE BEEN LET DOWN BY POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE PERHAPS THE  BIGGEST BATTLE GROUND IS THE AISLE ITSELF PARTICULARLY THE CANDY AISLE.
MIKE AND IKE ARE SPLITTING UP OVER CREATIVE DIFFERENCES. THE STORY GOES THEY CAN'T AGREE ON THEIR IDEAS FOR THE CANDY. MIKE WANTS TO PURSUE MUSIC AND IKE WANTS TO BE AN ARTIST.
Jon: WHY IS THIS IN THE GAYWATCH SEGMENT AND NOT THE CHILDHOOD DIABETES WATCH? I'M BEING TOLD I'M ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
THE DUO IS STAGING A GAY DIVORCE AS PART OF A NEW AD CAMPAIGN TO DRAW IN YOUNGER CUSTOMERS.
Jon: HOW DID... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NOTHING IN THE MIKE AND IKE AD CAMPAIGN SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT MIKE AND IKE BEING GAY. UNLESS YOU'RE CONFUSED BY THE PART OF THE BOX THAT SAYS ORIGINAL FRUIT BUT THAT IS NOT  WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOMETIMES COUPLES BREAK UP, HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH GAYNESS OR NOT GAYNESS OR NOT... THEY'RE NOT EVEN MARRIED. I THINK THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WHAT, FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON TONY PERKINS I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE  JUST SEEING WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE. WE NEED TO TALK FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. MEET ME FROM CAMERA THREE. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU SEE. YOU KNOW, LOOK, LET ME... WILL YOU GUYS SHUT UP? I'M TALKING TO SOMEBODY. LOOK. MR. PERKINS, WHAT? I'M JUST... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... I'M JUST SAYING... OH, I  HAVE SUCH A HEADACHE. LOOK, WHEN A PATIENT FIXATES ON A CERTAIN PERCEIVED REALITY, USUALLY IT SPEAKS TO A DEEP SEATED FEAR OF WHAT LIES WITHIN THEMSELVES. YOU SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE REGARDLESS, WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THERE. IT'S THE VOICE OF THE UNTRAMMELED ID. BUBBLING UP AND ERUPTING ALL OVER ITSELF AND OTHERS.
