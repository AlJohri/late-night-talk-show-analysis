WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT A FORMER MEMBER OF NAVY SEAL TEAM 6, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED SEAL TEAM 6 MEMOIRS OF AN ELITE NAVY SEAL SNIPER. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM HOWARD WASDIN, SIR.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
A GREAT HONOR.
TREMENDOUS.
JUST LIKE TO SAY HELLO, TAKE THAT APPLAUSE AND DIRECT IT TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING NOW.
SERVING RIGHT NOW.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE SEAL TEAM SIX IS AN ONGOING ELITE SUBSET  OF THE SEAL TEAMS; IS THAT CORRECT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY SUBSET. THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT MISSION, JOHN. THEY ARE THE TIER 1 COUNTERTERRORIST UNITS. WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE THE ASSETS, THE TRAINING, CAPABILITIES TO DEPLOY ANYWHERE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.
RIGHT.
AND DO THIS TYPE OF OP THAT YOU SAW ON ME FIRST.
I GUESS WHAT I AM SAYING IS THERE ARE OTHER NAVY SEAL TEAMS THAT ARE NOT PART OF SIX.
THERE ARE OTHER NUMBER TEAMS, THAT'S RIGHT.
AND HOW, DOES THEIR TRAINING DIFFER FROM THE OTHER NAVY SEALS. I KNOW IT DIFFERENTS FROM LET'S SAY THE REGULAR NAVY BUT HOW WOULD IT DIFFERENT  FROM EVEN THE OTHER NAVY SEALS?
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ON ONE POINT HERE. JUST BECAUSE ARE YOU A MEMBER OF SEAL TEAM 6, OR A MORE ELITE SEAL, ALL SEALS ARE ELITE. IT JUST MEANS YOU'VE DECIDED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LIFETILE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS YOU ARE EVEN MORE COMMITTED TO DOING THIS TYPE OF JOB IT  BECOMES A LIFESTYLE DAY IN AND DAY OUT OF PRACTICING, TRAINING, NEVER ENDING. AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE ABOUT PROBABLY A SIX TO EIGHT YEAR TRAINING LIFE SPAN.
WHILE YOU'RE ACTUALLY THERE, BECAUSE YOU PHYSICALLY JUST CAN'T KEEP DOING THAT. YOU MENTALLY CAN'T KEEP DOING THAT AND YOUR FAMILY IS GOING TO SUFFER TOO  BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE GOT KIDS LIKE I HAVE, YOU COULDN'T SERVE TWO MASTERS, IT COST  ME MY WIFE AND KIDS BECAUSE I WAS MORE MARRIED TO THE TEAM. SO IF YOU GO TO THIS TEAM, IT'S ALL OR NOTHING, YOU HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY DEDICATED AND YOU KNOW, MOST  WIVES DON'T LIKE IT WHEN A HUSBAND WAKES UP AND SAYS HEY, MY PAGER IS GOING OFF, I WILL SEE YOU MAYBE IN A FEW MONTHS.
AND YOU REALLY DO LIVE LIKE A SHADOW. YOU KIND OF MOVE AND DO THAT YOU WERE IN MOGADISHU.
THAT WAS MY CAREER ENDER, THE WHOLE BLACKHAWK DOWN OP I GOT SHOT THREE TIMES IN THAT OP. THERE ARE PARALLELS HERE WE DON'T NEED TO MISS BETWEEN THE MOGADISHU BLACKHAWK DOWN  OP AND A BATA BAD OP. LESSONS LEARN, 234 SOMALIA WE DIDN'T HAVE OPERATIONAL SECURITY, WORKING WITH THE  UNITED NATIONS, WITH THESE OTHER COUNTRIES SO PEOPLE KNEW WHEN WE WERE COMING, LEAVING, WHAT WE WERE DOING. AND I'M A REPUBLICAN BUT THE PRESIDENT GOT IT RIGHT HERE. I'M ACTUALLY THINKING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THIS GUY BEING A REALLY GOOD PRESIDENT.
WHAT DID HE GET RIGHT?
WHAT HE GOT RIGHT IS TWO THINGS ACTUALLY THREE THINGS IT. ONE THING DEFINITELY WAS OPERATIONAL SECURITY, HE DID NOT TELL PAKISTAN WE WERE COMING. I KNOW THAT MAKES US BAD PEOPLE BECAUSE WE DID SOMETHING ON THEIR FOREIGN SOIL. WE DIDN'T KILL 3,000 OF THEIR PEOPLE, BUT YOU KNOW, SO WE WENT OVER THERE AND DID THAT AND DIDN'T LET THEM KNOW WE WERE COMING SO THAT  KEPT OUR PEOPLE SAFE. MADE THE MISSION.
DO YOU THINK THEY DID THAT BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THAT WOULD COMPROMISE, THEY  FELT THEY COULD NOT TRUST THAT CHAIN OF COMMAND ON THE OTHER SIDE.
AND SINCE I'M NOT RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND I DON'T WANT  YOUR VOTE, ABSOLUTELY SECOND THING IS HE GOT IT RIGHT WITH THIS BURIAL AT SEA. THAT WAS INGENUOUS.
THAT WAS MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF IT.
YEAH, BUT THINK ABOUT IT, IF WE HAD GIVEN THEM SOMEWHERE TO GO AND PAY HOMAGE TO THIS, YOU KNOW, EVIL PERSON OR WHATEVER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE. THE OTHER THING HE GOT RIGHT WAS NOT RELEASING THE PICTURES. I THINK HE GOT IT RIGHT ON ALL THREE THINGS AND I'M SITTING HERE GOING YOU KNOW  WHAT I DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE GUY BUT HEY, AS AMERICA WE GOT TO ADMIT WHEN A  PRESIDENT GETS IT RIGHT.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT, I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT WAR BUT I  THINK MAYBE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION IN TERMS OF SECURITY, I HAD NOT  REALIZED JUST HOW SECRETIVE THE SEAL TEAMS HAVE TO BE. I MEAN EVEN IN YOUR BOOK THERE ARE FACES BLACKED OUT STILL. THERE IS AN ANONYMITY THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR.
SURE.
AND MOGADISHU WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. WHEN YOU WERE INJURED.
I WAS PART OF THE FAILED OP TO TAKE DOWN THE, YOU KNOW, THE HOTEL THAT DAY. I WAS SHOT THE FIRST TIME AT THE TARGET HOTEL. SHOT THE SECOND TIME, PICKING UP RANGERS OFF THE STREET AND SHOT THE THIRD TIME TRYING TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. IN A HUMVEE.
HOW LONG DID THE PROCESS LAST WHERE YOU CONTINUED TO OPERATE WHILE HAVING BEEN SHOT.
ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF HOURS. BUT WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT --
NO, LET'S NOT GLORIFY THAT. LET'S JUST STOP FOR A SECOND. BECAUSE YOU AND I IT VERY SIMILAR, AND I DON'T, OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BRAG, BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING NOW. YOU-- YOU HAVEN'T NECESSARILY BEEN AROUND IN A WHILE BUT I KNOW YOU WANT TO  SEE THAT, RIGHT THERE. LET ME TELL YOU MY WAR STORY.
IS THAT ON THE PENIS WHEEL? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT THING IS MUCH SHARPER THAN IT LOOKS.
IT BRINGS UP A POINT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIVING A LIFE THAT IS SO BEYOND IN  COMPARISON TO WHAT WE CAN IMAGINE AND THEN THIS STORY COMES UP IN ABBOTTABAD. HOW DO YOU READJUST TO CIVILIAN LIFE. ARE YOU A CHIROPRACTOR NOW. YOU PICKED YOUR LIFE UP AND HAVE DONE THAT. BUT HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO READJUST TO SORT OF THIS IDEA THAT YOU ARE LIVING  LIKE A NORMAL CITIZEN?
YOU KNOW WHAT, AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND A LOT OF WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT. ANYBODY WHO BUYS THIS BOOK, IT'S NOT A WAR STORY BOOK, NOT A WARMONGERING BOOK. IT'S ABOUT OVERCOMING ADVERSITY, OVERCOMING ADVERSITY IN MY EARLY LIFE  AND THEN THE QUESTION YOU JUST WENT INTO. THE LOWEST POINT OF MY LIFE, JOHN, WAS AFTER GETTING SHOT THREE TIMES, GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE, THINKING I WAS WEAK  BECAUSE LOOKING BACK WITH MY DOCTOR HAD ON NOW, NOT REALIZING I HAD POST TRAUMATIC STRESS AND THIS  OTHER THING CALLED SURVIVOR'S GUILT THAT I DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT UNTIL YEARS LATER. WHY I WAS ALLOWED TO LIVE AND SO MANY GOOD PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO DIE. SO TRANSITIONING FROM ROCK STAR TO ROCK BOTTOM, AND TRYING TO ASSIMILATE BACK  INTO SOCIETY WAS ALMOST THE END OF ME. AND LUCKILY, GOD PUT THE RIGHT WOMAN IN MY PATH. SHE PICKED ME UP, DUSTED ME OFF, TAUGHT ME INTO GOING BACK INTO SCHOOL TO BE A  CHIROPRACTOR, TALKED ME INTO FINISHING MY BOOK AND I OWE EVERYTHING TO HER.
IT'S AN AMAZING STORY. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR STORY. YOU CAN STATE RYE THERE. SALE TEAM SIX, ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. IT'S A WONDERFUL BOOK. HOWARD WASDIN, SIR
