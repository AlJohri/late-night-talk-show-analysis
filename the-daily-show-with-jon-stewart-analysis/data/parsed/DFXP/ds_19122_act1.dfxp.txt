FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE FORMER IRAQ AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS, HAMID AL-BAYATI, WILL BE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT, AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "FROM DICTATORSHIP TO DEMOCRACY," WHICH I IMAGINE FOR THE PAPERBACK THERE WILL PROBABLY OBVIOUSLY BE AN ADDENDUM, DEPENDING ON WHERE IT GOES NEXT. BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES A LEGAL RULING COMES DOWN THAT MAKES EVERYONE SAY, WHAT? WE'RE JUST GETTING AROUND TO THAT NOW? LIKE WHEN MISSISSIPPI FINALLY RATIFIED THE 13th AMENDMENT BANNING SLAVERY. [LAUGHTER] UM, LAST YEAR. LAUGHTER OR WHEN THE SUPREME COURT RULED RECENTLY YOU CAN NO LONGER USE KITTENS FOR SKEET SHOOTING. [LAUGHTER] [AUDIENCE REACTS] BEFORE YOU, OH, THAT CAT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S ATTACKING. IT MAY JUST BE THE VISUAL. THAT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HAPPY KITTY. BUT THESE LEGAL DECISIONS ARE THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT "JON STEWART." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I HAD SAID WE SHOULDN'T DO THAT ONE SO IF WE CAN JUST... I DON'T THINK THAT THAT... I DON'T THINK THAT THAT... I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S BETTER... [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S NOT EVEN A LEGAL PUN. THAT'S JUST... THERE YOU GO! "THURSDAY NIGHT LAW." ANYWAY, OUR FIRST STORY INVOLVES A SPORTS FRANCHISE WHOSE NAME IS A BIT OF A QUAINT REFERENCE TO THE PERCEIVED COLOR OF THE SKIN OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPENT A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YEARS PREPARING THIS COUNTRY FOR US TO DISCOVER.
TODAY THE U.S. PATENT OFFICE REVOKED THE TEAM'S TRADEMARK, CALLING THE NAME A RACIAL SLUR IN BLATANT VIOLATION IN PROHIBITION AGAINST DISPARAGING TRADEMARKS.
Jon: WHOA, THEY SAID THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE NAME BECAUSE IT'S A RACIAL SLUR. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE SAME REASON WHY NOTRE DAME HAD TO CHANGE THEIR MONIKER TO "THE FIGHTING IRISH" FROM "THE DRUNK GOOD FOR NOTHING FIGHTING IRISH." PLEASE, PLEASE SEND YOUR ANGRY LETTERS TO BRIAN WILLIAMS CARE OF NBC NEWS. SO THE REDSKINS NO LONGER OWN THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THEIR OWN NAME, MEANING ANYONE IS FREE TO FLOOD THE MARKET WITH REDSKINS BRANDED PRODUCTS OF ANY KIND FROM BUTT CREAMS TO, I DON'T KNOW, REDSKINS OWNER SIZED CONDOMS. THAT'S AN ACTUAL PENNY. ALL I'M SAYING IS THE REDSKINS' OWNER HAS A TINY [BLEEPED]. WHAT? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONTROVERSY IS. PERHAPS NOW REDSKINS' OWNER DANIEL SNYDER WILL FINALLY CONCEDE THAT THIS NAME IS NO LONGER TENABLE.
TODAY THE TEAM SAID IT WOULD APPEAL. THE OWNER OF THE TEAM, DANIEL SNYDER, HAS REFUSED TO CHANGE THE NAME CITING TRADITION.
Jon: OH, TRADITION. SO YOUR ARGUMENT IN KEEPING YOUR NAME IS YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN HERE AND TAKE OVER OUR ANCESTRAL PROPERTY IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU'RE SAYING... I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE HAD IT FIRST. IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS, IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS I GUESS, IF A GROUP OF PEOPLE TAUGHT YOU HOW THE SURVIVE A HARSH WINTER AND THEN YOU INVITED THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE TO A FEAST TO SHOW YOUR GRATITUDE TO THEM FOR HELPING YOU TO SURVIVE AND THEN AFTER DESSERT LET'S SAY YOU KILLED THEM AND TOOK THEIR LAND AND THEN YEARS LATER TO COMMEMORATE THAT DAY, YOU HELD AN ANNUAL FEAST THAT INCLUDED A SPORTING EVENT IN WHICH ONE OF THE PARTICIPATING TEAM'S NAMES WAS A DEROGATORY TERM FOR THE ORIGINAL PEOPLE THAT YOU HAD KILLED. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE REDSKINS! THE REDSKINS, NOT THE PACKERS. SWITCH IT. GET A NEW NAME ALREADY. IT'S THE 21st CENTURY. HARD TO THINK OF ANY OTHER CHANGE THAT'S THIS LONG OVERDUE.
A NEW BILL IN JAPAN OUTLAWS THE POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. [LAUGHTER] DID YOU SAY "A NEW BILL-- A NEW BILL." THAT MAKES JAPAN MAYBE THE ONLY COUNTRY TO INVENT A ROBOT WHO CAN MAKE PANCAKES BEFORE OUTLAWING THE POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THE PANCAKE ROBOT, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT. I REALLY HOPE THIS IS JUST BECAUSE JAPAN HAS NO CHILD PORN. AND THEN THEY PASS THIS LEGISLATION IN CASE ANYONE EVER GOT IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE OUR VOTER I.D. LAWS TO PREVENT FRAUD. IT'S JUST THEORETICAL, RIGHT.
ON THE STREETS OF TOKYO SEX SELLS, MAGAZINES AND VIDEOS, SO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT, PORNOGRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OF YOUNG GIRLS ENGAGED IN VIOLENT SEX OFTENTIMES WITH OLDER MEN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK WE ALL OWE GODZILLA AN APOLOGY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, I GUESS, CONGRATULATIONS, JAPAN, BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
BUT GRAPHIC CARTOONS, EVEN ONES SHOWING KIDS BEING RAPED, WILL STAY LEGAL. WHY? BECAUSE ANIME ANIMATION AND MANGA COMICS ARE A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WITH POLITICAL AND LOBBYING POWER.
Jon: THAT IS EMBARRASSING, JAPAN. THAT IS EMBARRASSING. HOW CAN A LOBBY FOR HARMFUL, DESTRUCTIVE INDUSTRY TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN? I AM FRANKLY... I AM... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I AM SHOCKED. I AM UPSET. SPEAKING OF, SPEAKING OF AMERICA'S NATIONAL WEAPON, THE GUN, THE SUPREME COURT RECENTLY HEARD A CASE INVOLVING SAID CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED FREEDOM MAKER.
BRUCE ABRAMSKI WAS A FORMER VIRGINIA POLICE OFFICER. HE OFFERED TO BUY THE GUN FOR HIS UNCLE WHO LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE COULD GET A DISCOUNT. THE UNCLE GAVE HIM THE MONEY WHEN HE BOUGHT THE GUN. HE CHECKED THE BOX ON A FORM THAT ASKED IF HE WAS THE ACTUAL BUYER.
Jon: I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM THERE. HE MERELY LIED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON A FORM IN ORDER TO DEFRAUD A GUN DEALER OF A FULL-PRICE SALE. I DON'T, LOOK, I'M SURE THE FORMS ARE CONFUSING. IT'S NOT LIKE THE FORM CLEARLY STATES, "QUESTION 11A: ARE YOU THE ACTUAL BUYER. WARNING, YOU ARE NOT THE ACTUAL BUYER IF YOU ARE ACQUIRING THE FIREARM ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON. I UNDERSTAND THAT ANSWERING YES TO QUESTION 11A IF I'M NOT THE ACTUALY BUYER IS A CRIME PUNISHABLE AS A FELONY UNDER FEDERAL LAW." THAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING. [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT A LEGAL SCHOLAR, BUT I'M GUESSING THIS IS GOING TO BRING US ONE OF THEM WHATCHU CALL IT THERE 9-0 DECISIONS IN THE SUPREME COURT.
IN A 5-4 DECISION, THE COURT RULED THAT THE BUYERS MUST TELL THE TRUTH WHEN THEY ARE BUYING GUNS FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
Jon: WHAT? WAIT. SO FOUR JUSTICES, FOUR JUSTICES ON THE NATION'S HIGHEST COURT RULED THAT WHEN BUYING GUNS, YOU CAN LIE.
AS SOON AS I BUY IT, I WALK OUT OF THE STORE AND I MEET THIS GUY IN THE PARKING LOT. HE SAYS, HEY, THAT'S A NIFTY-LOOKING GUN THERE. HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR IT? HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, I PAID $600. I'LL GIVE YOU $700. IT'S YOURS. RIGHT? I CAN HAND IT TO HIM, CAN'T I?
Jon: YES, AND THEN HE CAN GET HIS $700 BACK AT WHAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME IS GUNPOINT. SO, YES, THERE IS APPARENTLY NO PROHIBITION ON TRANSFERRING THE GUN AFTER YOU BUY IT, SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT, SCALIA?
THE NOTION THAT THE GUN WOULD SOMEHOW GET INTO THE HANDS OF SOMEBODY WHO, YOU KNOW, WHO WASN'T REGISTERED OR COULDN'T BUY IT HIMSELF, I MEAN, THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. WHAT YOU ASSERT DOES NOT STOP THAT PROBLEM.
Jon: SCALIA IS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO THE PRECEDENT-MAKING CASE BLEEP HAPPENS V. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I GUESS THE REAL TAKEAWAY IS THIS, THIS IS WHAT'S CRAZY. SO, SO THE REAL TAKEAWAY FROM THIS IS, SO YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO BUY A GUN AT A GUN STORE AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME TYPE OF QUESTIONNAIRE BACKGROUND CHECK. BUT THEN YOU CAN JUST SELL IT OR GIVE IT TO THE FIRST PERSON YOU SEE IN A PARKING LOT. SO MY ADVICE TO YOU IS THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE A GUY COME AT YOU IN PARKING LOT WAVING A GUN, DON'T BE AFRAID. HE'S JUST EXCITED AT WHAT A GREAT DEAL HE JUST GOT. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
