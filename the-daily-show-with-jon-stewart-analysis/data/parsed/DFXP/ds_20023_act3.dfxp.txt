I UNDERSTAND.
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU. AND I WILL BE RELYING ON YOU TO A GREAT EXTENT. I WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, STEVE CARELL. (APPLAUSE) STEVE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME. I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP HERE.
YEAH.
Jon: I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP HERE. SO I GO, AND THIS IS SOMETHING, A DON'T MEAN IN NO WAY TO BE DISRESPECTFUL. I GO TO SEE THE MOVIE "FOXCATCHER." I SEE THE MOVIE "FOXCATCHER." IT IS A BRILLIANT MOVIE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: IT'S A WONDERFUL MOVIE. THE PERFORMANCES ARE INCREDIBLE. YOU'RE NOT IN IT.
NO.
Jon: I DON'T SEE, I WATCH THE WHOLE THING, THEY KEEP TELLING ME, STEVE CARELL HE IS GREAT IN THIS YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT, HE'S SO GOOD. I KNOW YOU, YOU'RE NOT IN THIS.
NO I AM NOT.
Jon: YOU WEREN'T IN THAT CLIP. I LOOKED ALL OVER THE THING. THERE IS A GENTLEMAN IN IT WHO IS PHENOMENAL.
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
Jon: HE PLAYS THIS CHARACTER DuPONT WHO IS SORT OF A TWISTED, HE'S AN ECCENTRIC, RICH, HE PLAYS IT, HE INHABITS IT, HE DOESN'T PLAY IT. IT'S NOT EVEN ACTING. IT'S BEING.
DOES HE DISAPPEAR.
Jon: HE DISAPPEARS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I'M WATCHING IT WITH AL PACINO, AL AND I WENT TO THE MOVIE. AND AL TURNS TO ME AND HE SAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT GUY IS, BUT I'M QUITTING. BECAUSE THAT GUY IS SO ACT-Y. WHAT WOULD THEY CALL IT? GOOD.
ACT-Y -- GOOD ACT-Y.
Jon: IT IS RIDICULOUS, DUDE. DID YOU HAVE ANY-- WHEN YOU WATCH IT, DOES IT EVEN FEEL LIKE YOU? DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER IT? IT IS AN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE.
I WILL ADMIT IT WAS WEIRD. IT WAS WEIRD.
Jon: IT'S WEIRD.
WE WENT AWAY FOR THREE MONTHS AND THAT WAS THREE HOURS EVERY DAY GETTING INTO THAT STUFF. AND IT WAS STRANGE. I MEAN, THIS IS A REAL GUY, AND WE MODELLED AFTER THIS REAL GUY.
Jon: BUT THE GESTURES, THE VOICE, EVERYTHING. AND IT DOESN'T FEEL, YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES YOU WATCH A MOVIE AND GO OH, LOOK AT THAT GUY, ACTING, SHOWING THE ACTING. DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT AT ALL.
THANKS.
Jon: IT'S LIKE AN INHABITING. AND YOU WERE HERE FOR YEARS AND I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WERE TALENTED. I MEAN, YOU WERE, YOU KNOW, WE-- WE WOULD HAVE YOU OUT THERE.
I KNOW.
YOU WERE EATING CRISCO, YOU'RE GETTING DRUNK, YOU'RE IN SHORTS. YOU KNOW.
I KNOW.
Jon: WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?
I TRIED BUT YOU WOULD NEVER LISTEN TO ME. CAN I JUST SAY, I SAW JON STEWART'S MOVIE.
Jon: YES, HE DID SEE THAT.
AND IT IS EQUALLY REMARKABLE AND FANTASTIC.
Jon: YES, YES. IT'S REMARKABLE. FANTASTIC. LET'S HAVE -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO? HERE'S WHAT WE DO.
I'M SERIOUS. HE IS A --
Jon: HERE'S WHAT WE DO. LET'S HAVE A FAWN OFF. A FAWN OFF.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
Jon: YOUR ACTING SHAKESPEARE FROM THE GRAVE GOT AN ERECTION WATCHING YOUR MOVIE.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DIRECTOR ACHIEVE IN ANY MOVIE IN HISTORY WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE MOVIE "ROSEWATER." IT NO, HONESTLY, HONESTLY IT IS, IT IS, I KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO -- YOU ARE BLOCKING, JON.
Jon: I'M BLOCKING.
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT-- YOU DON'T WANT ME TO EMBARRASS YOU.
Jon: NO, I DO. I'M VERY PROUD OF IT.
IT IS FANTASTIC. YOU KNOW WHAT?
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. STEVE CAME TO SEE IT IN TELLURIDE. AND I HAVE TO SAY, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE SHOWED IT TO A CROWD.
IT WAS SO GOOD.
Jon: AND WHEN I SAW STEVE COME OUT THROUGH THE CROWD, IT REALLY DID, LIKE IT GOT LIKE WATERY. LIKE YOU CAME UP AND I WAS JUST LIKE -- I KNOW YOU. LIKE, IT WAS LIKE --
I KNOW. IT WAS LIKE WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
Jon: I KNOW. AND NO OXYGEN.
NO.
Jon: DID YOU KNOW? HAD YOU BEEN TO TELLURIDE PREVIOUSLY?
NO, I HADN'T.
Jon: IT'S 50,000 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL.
IT IS. YEAH.
I FELT LIKE, YOU TELL ME IF YOU FELT LIKE THIS. WHEN I GOT OFF, THERE'S LIKE GONDOLAS THAT TAKE YOU PLACES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WALK. AND I REMEMBER TO THE BEING ABLE TO BREATHE BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS WALKING. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.
YEAH, EVERYBODY WAS FINE.
Jon: EVERYBODY WAS WALKING AROUND LIKE --
AND YOU NEED A MASK, SOME SORT OF OXYGEN MASK TO WALK AROUND UP THERE.
Jon: RIGHT. AND I WANTED TO GRAB PEOPLE AND GO DON'T YOU SEE THEY'RE SUFFOCATING US?
YEAH. YOU JUST HAVE A PERPETUAL HEADACHE UP THERE. BEAUTIFUL, THOUGH.
Jon: IT IS -- WE THINK, OR MAYBE THAT WAS A HALLUCINATION.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHEN YOU -- WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS, THOUGH, AND YOU INHABIT SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND IT'S A DARK PLACE FOR THREE MONTHS. AND ARE YOU NOT A DARK INDIVIDUAL. I HAVE KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME. ARE YOU NOT, RIGHT NOW MAYBE. BUT -- -- OR WHAT QUESTION DO WANT TO ANSWER? REALLY, IT'S UP TO YOU WHATEVER QUESTION. BUT DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST A GOOD PERSON. I WOULD THINK IT'S DIFFICULT TO LIVE IN THAT FOR A WHILE.
IT WAS STRANGE. ACTUALLY, WE SHOT IT IN PITTSBURGH AND I'M GLAD, I WENT HOME ON THE WEEKENDS. BUT IT IS A WEIRD THING. AND NOT TO SOUND TOO ACTORY --
Jon: YEAH.
OR METHODY, BUT YOU KIND OF STAY IN IT. NOT LIKE I WAS WALKING AROUND IN CHARACTER THE WHOLE TIME, BUT YOU STAY IN THAT TONE, AND IT'S PRETTY HEAVY AND IT'S DARK.
Jon: RIGHT. THE KIDS ARE TOO YOUNG TO SEE THIS.
OH, YEAH, NO IT WOULDN'T, IT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD THING TO SEE DAD DOING THAT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA BE AWESOME THOUGH WHEN THEY ARE LIKE 18 AND ACTING UP A LITTLE BIT. AND YOU GO COME IN THIS ROOM. PUT ON THE DVD PLAYER.
AND I WILL SIT BEHIND THEM GOING--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT IS REMARKABLE. AND I'M GOING A THIS AND I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT, BUT HERE'S HOW GOOD IT WAS. OSCAR, THE STATUE WILL OPEN HIS ARMS AND EMBRACE STEVE CARELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PUT THAT ON THE POSTER. STEVE CARELL. "FOXCATCHER." IN THE THEATRES ON FRIDAY. STEVE CARELL. STEVE CARELL!
