[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS WE ALL KNOW, THE ROLLOUT OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS BEEN PERFECT. AND IT IS ABOUT TO GET PERFECT-IER. ASSIF MANDVI HAS MORE. FORGET THE HORRIBLE WEB SITE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. THE REAL TEST FOR OBAMACARE IS THE SAME AS EVERY OTHER PRODUCT IN THE WORLD. WILL YOUNG PEOPLE BUY IT. BUT DON'T WORRY OBAMACARE PROPONENTS LIKE ADAM FOX HAVE GOT IT COVERED.
YOUNG ADULTS ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE JOB MOBILITY. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
THAT'S A REALLY COMPELLING ARGUMENT. I'M ASSUMING THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF INFORMATION YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO YOUNG PEOPLE WITH.
YES, IT IS.
I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH.
I'VE GOT THEM RIGHT HERE. SO THIS IS ONE OF THE ADS, IT'S TITLED "BROSURANCE," AND IT SAYS, 'KEG STANDS ARE CRAZY. NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE IS CRAZIER. DON'T TAP INTO YOUR BEER MONEY TO COVER THOSE MEDICAL BILLS. WE'VE GOT IT COVERED. NOW YOU CAN, TOO."
OKAY. I SEE WHAT YOU ARE PUTTING DOWN. IF YOU WANT TO CATCH A BRO YOU GOTTA USE A LITTLE BEER. AND THE ADS CERTAINLY GOT THE ATTENTION OF YOUNG AMERICAN BROS AND LADY BROS. I WAS SHOCKED THAT THAT WAS AN ACTUAL INSURANCE AD, ADVOCATING FOR FALLING OFF OF KEGS AND GETTING REALLY DRUNK. >>YEAH BUT AREN'T THEY LIKE, TELLING YOU, YOU KNOW, HEY MAN, YOU CAN CAN GET DRUNK AND HAVE A GREAT TIME. IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE.
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE TOO  STEREOTYPICAL.
I DON'T SEE ANY WOMEN IN THEM. I'M NOT A BRO. GOOD POINT.
ADAM FOX, GOT ANYTHING FOR THE LADIES?
OF COURSE. SO THIS IS FROM OUR SECOND WAVE OF ADS, LET'S GET PHYSICAL. OMG HE IS HOT. LET'S HOPE HE IS AS EASY TO GET AS BIRTH CONTROL.
WOW, SO, BROSURANCE BEFORE HOSURANCE, RIGHT?
THEY'RE BASICALLY PORTRAYING YOU AS BEING SOMEONE WHOSE ONLY GOAL IN LIFE  IS TO SLEEP AROUND. WOULD IT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IF THE DUDE WAS HOTTER? NO. NO. LADY BRO IN THE FRONT ROW.
NO WAY.
THE ANTI-OBAMACARE SIDE ALSO CONDEMNS THE ADS. CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST, KELLY MAHER: THEY'RE TRYING TO MARKET TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY'RE TRYING TO  MAKE HEALTHCARE COOL WITH KEG STANDS AND THE REALITY IS IT'S JUST MERELY MAKING YOUNG PEOPLE LOOK VERY SHALLOW.
ARE THEY NOT COOL TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A COLLEGE KID ANYMORE?
NO I THINK THEY ARE A LOT OF -- WAIT WHAT? DID YOU CALL ME OLD?
I MEAN, YOU ARE OLDER THAN COLLEGE KIDS IS WHAT I'M SAYING?
I'M RECENTLY OUT OF COLLEGE ISH. >>AND BASED ON HER RECENT COLLEGE-ISH EXPERIENCE SHE KNOWS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE TALKED DOWN TO.
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE HEALTH CARE IS TOO SERIOUS OF AN ISSUE TO SELL WITH KEG STANDS.
THAT'S WHY ANTI-OBAMACARE GROUPS LIKE GENERATION OPPORTUNITY ARE HOLDING EDUCATIONAL EVENTS LIKE THIS.
THEY QUOTE, "ROLLED IN WITH A FLEET OF HUMMERS, SET UP OPT OUT CORN HOLE SETS, BEER PONG TABLES AND HIRED 8 BRAND AMBASSADORS, AKA MODELS, WITH BULL HORNS."
YOU GOT KEG STANDS FOR OBAMACARE, YOU GOT CORN HOLE AGAINST OBAMACARE. WE'RE ALL DOING THE SAME THING?
NO.
NO? REALLY?
I THINK THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING A STUDENT EVENT AND CREATING AN ENTIRE MARKETING CAMPAIGN THAT MINIMIZES YOUNG PEOPLE.
YEAH BUT YOU GUYS ARE GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE DRUNK.
WE TAKE ACTION IN THE POLITICAL ARENA.
THEY TOOK ACTION ALL RIGHT BUT WHICH SIDE'S BEER SOAKED OUTREACH IS WINNING? THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN HEALTH CARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE.
WHICH TEAM ARE YOU ON? TEAM BROSURANCE OR TEAM OPT OUT?
NEITHER.
NEITHER? NEITHER. COME ON, THEY'RE TWO AWESOME PARTIES, DUDES!
I DON'T THINK THE ADS ANSWER ANY HEALTHCARE QUESTIONS.
I STILL AM SO CLOUDY ON THE WHOLE OBAMACARE THING.
WILL THE QUALITY REMAIN THE SAME?
WHAT KIND OF DOCTORS CAN I SEE? WHAT KIND OF PROCEDURES DOES IT COVER?
SO WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT I'M GETTING HERE IS THAT KEG STANDS AND ONE NIGHT STANDS ARE NOT RELEVANT TO YOUR LIVES AT ALL.
NOT AT ALL.
OF COURSE, RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT BROS AND LADY BROS DID LIKE BACK IN THE 80s  THESE ARE LIKE MOLLY RINGWALD MOVIES. YOU NEED ADS THAT SPEAK TO YOU TODAY.
NO.
YES, YOU DO. YO, BROSURANCE, GENERATION OPPORTUNITY: THIS IS HOW YOU PANDER TO MODERN YOUTH. THEY WANT TO GREW UP TO BE BAD AND WHEN YOU ARE THIS BAD YOU NEED HEALTH INSURANCE.
WITH  OBAMACARE, YOU WON'T HAVE TO SPEND ALL YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.
I GOT THESE LADIES AND I GOT THESE GUNS. I GOT A LAPTAP JUST FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV. YEEEEEAH.
HEALTHCARE RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMPLICATED ENOUGH WITHOUT PAYING DOUBLE FOR BIRTH CONTROL OR TRIPLE. BIKINIS, BIG BOOTIES AND HEALTH CARE Y'ALL THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT! [GUN SHOT] OW! IT'S OKAY. I GOT HEALTH INSURANCE.
HEALTH CARE, BITCHES. GET SOME!
Jon: AASIF MANDVI. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
