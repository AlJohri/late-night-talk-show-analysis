FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.
Jon: HEY WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BAM! WE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! MY GUEST STEVEN BRILL HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE HEALTH CARE EXPOSE, "AMERICAN'S BITTER PILL." BUT FIRST I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T-- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. HEY, HAPPY 2015 EVERYBODY! HAPPY NEW YEAR! 2015 IN THE HOUSE.
2015 IS JUST HOURS OLD BUT ALL EYES ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO 2016.
2015 MEANS IT'S 2016 DECISION TIME.
2015 IS REALLY THE START OF 2016. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: [BLEEP] [BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: [BLEEP] [BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I BUY MY NOVELTY GLASSES BY THE DECADE. SO -- BUT YOU HEARD RIGHT. THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN. OUR NATION'S HIGHEST OFFICE UP FOR GRABS IN A NO HOLDS BARRED, FREE FOR ALL, THE MOST THRILLING RITUAL OF AMERICAN POLITICS, AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2016 IT BEGINS! WHO HAS GOT FIRST?
FORMER VIRGINIA SENATOR JIM WEBB BECAME THE FIRST PERSON IN EITHER PARTY TO ANNOUNCE AN EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OKAY. JIM -- JIM WEBB. CHARLOTTE'S BROTHER JIM. (LAUGHTER) WELL, HE'S IN FIRST. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AT LEAST HE'S COMING IN CLEAN, BLANK SLATE NO WAY THEY CAN TAKE JIM WEBB DOWN THIS EARLY -- REALLY THAT FAST, THEY GOT HIM, ALREADY? THEY GOT HIM DOWN.
QUESTIONS SWIRLING AROUND A DEMOCRATIC PROSPECT FOR PRESIDENT AND PAYMENTS HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER GOT FROM HIS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $90,000 OVER SOME 12 YEARS BUT IT WAS PAID TO HIS CLOSE RELATIVES. HIS DAUGHTER DOES HAVE A WEB MARKETING FIRM. SHE REDID HIS WEBSITE AND HELPED WITH SOME OF THE WEB 2016 MATERIAL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I BELIEVE I HAVE A CLEVER REPOST TO THAT. SO YOU ARE SAYING JIM WEBB IS EMBROILED IN A SCANDAL INVOLVING A WEB SITE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE MOST IRONIC FALL FROM GRACE SINCE SENATOR MELVIN DICKPICTWEET. (LAUGHTER) WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS BORN, THAT WASN'T A THING. AND AS HE GOT OLDER, THEY -- HEY, DICKPICTWEET, AND HE THOUGHT OH, I SHOULD REALLY SEE WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. OBVIOUSLY IT HURT HIS CAREER MUCH TO HIS APPARENT DISDAIN. SO NOT THAT WE NEED OTHER OPTIONS FOR PRESIDENT, BUT PLEASE TELL ME WE HAVE OTHER OPTIONS.
INDEPENDENT VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS IS HINTING THAT HE MIGHT TRY TO FILL THAT VOID. HE'S NOT YET A DEMOCRAT OFFICIALLY BUT HE HAS VISITED IOWA FOUR TIMES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: VISITED IOWA FOUR TIMES AND JUDGING BY HIS HAIR, HE RAN THERE. (LAUGHTER) I GOT TWO WORDS FOR BERNIE SANDERS -- LICK, LICK. WHAT DID YOU DO, GO TO THE BARBER AND SAY GIVE ME THE DOC BROWN? I MEAN COME ON! RUN FOR PRESIDENT, OLD MAN. I WILL OWN YOU, SANDERS. I WILL OWN YOU. COME ON, KEEP THEM COMING, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE LIKE PRINGLES, ONCE YOU POP, YOU CAN'T STOP, GIVE ME MORE.
IF YOU LOOK AT CHRIS CHRISISTIE FROM MY HOME STATE IN NEW JERSEY PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY WILL TELL YOU HE PROBABLY SPENDS MORE TIME IN IOWA THAN HE DOES IN NEW JERSEY.
OVER THE PAST YEAR HE HAS SPENT 152 DAYS OR 42% OF HIS TIME OUTSIDE OF NEW JERSEY.
Jon: 42%, THAT IS RUDE. EXPECIALLY FOR A GOVERNOR WHO MADE THE REST OF NEW JERSEY SPEND 42% OF OUR TIME ON THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE. NOT THAT WE MIND YOU KEEPING A LITTLE DISTANCE. YOU CAN STAY OUT OF THE STATE, CHRISTIE, AS LONG AS YOU KEEP IT RESPECTFUL.
GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, HE WAS BACK IN THE COWBOY'S OWNER'S BOX LAST NIGHT.
Jon: I ASSUME THE PHRASE BACK IN THE COWBOY'S OWNER BOXES IS SOME SORT OF SLANG FOR SNORTING CRYSTAL METH AND HORSE (BLEEP) OUT OF A COWBOY HAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE PREFERABLE THAN SITTING NEXT TO JERRY JONES THE OWNER OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS, THE MOST HATED MAN OF THE TRI-STATE AREA.
HIS FAVORITE FOOTBALL TEAM WAS HOSTING THE DETROIT LIONS IN THE PLAYOFFS. AND WHEN THE COWBOYS MADE A LATE COME BACK TO WIN THE GAME, THERE IS THE GOVERNOR GOING FOR THE HIGH FIVE WITH DALLAS OWNER JERRY JONES.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP] YOU LEAD A STATE, CHRISTIE, THAT'S HALF GIANTS FANS, HALF EAGLES FANS AND YOU ARE GROPING THE OWNER OF THE DALLAS [BLEEP] COWBOYS? WHY DON'T YOU JUST BREAK A COPY OF "BORN TO RUN" OVER THE HEAD OF A HURRICANE SANDY VICTIM YOU BACKSTABBING PIECE OF [BLEEP]. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOT ONLY -- NOT ONLY DO WE NOT WANT TO SEE YOU HUGGING JERRY JONES. I DON'T THINK JERRY JONES WANTS TO SEE YOU HUGGING JERRY JONES. LOOK AT HIM -- LOOK AT HIM TRY TO GET AWAY. TRYING TO EVADE THE TACKLE. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS THAT'S IT.
THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF SPECULATION AS TO WHETHER I WOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NO THERE HASN'T. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE WE RUN IN DIFFERENT CIRCLES BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN  HEARING -- ANY HUCKABUZZ. BESIDES YOU ALREADY HAVE A GOOD JOB OVER THERE ON FOX NEWS, RIGHT?
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO DO MORE THAN JUST SAY GOOD NIGHT. I'M GOING TO SAY GOOD-BYE. THIS IS THE LAST EDITION OF HUCKABEE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
Jon: NO, WAIT, DON'T GO. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU LEAVE WHO WILL THEY HAVE TO REPRESENT THE AGGRIEVED WHITE CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT, OKAY, I GET IT. I GUESS YOU CAN GO.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT RUNNING UNTIL LATE IN THE SPRING OF 2015. BUT THE CONTINUED CHATTER HAS PUT FOX NEWS INTO A POSITION THAT JUST ISN'T FAIR TO THEM.
Jon: NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT! YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE -- OOH, THE PHONE IS RINGING OFF THE HOOK. YOU'RE LIKE A GUY BREAKING UP WITH SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU TWO WERE EVER GOING OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S NOT FAIR TO YOU, FOR TO US GO ON LIKE THIS. UH, OKAY. ENOUGH OF THE OPENING ACTS WHO WON'T MAKE IT PAST THE SECOND PRIMARY DEBATE. WHEN DOES THE 2016 HEADLINER COME ON?
FOR THE DEMOCRATS ALL EYES ARE ON HILLARY CLINTON, THIS WEEK SHE TEASED HER SUPPORTERS WITH THIS E-MAIL ENTITLED ANNOUNCEMENT.
Jon: OMG! OMG! THIS IS IT! THIS IS IT! THE LEAST SURPRISING SUPRISE IN THE WORLD IS FINALLY HERE! WHAT POSSIBLE OTHER ANNOUNCEMENT COULD HILLARY CLINTON, THE WOMAN EVERYONE IN AMERICA KNOWS IS GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT GIVE? SHE KNOWS THAT WE KNOW THAT, WE KNOW THAT SHE KNOWS THAT WE KNOW, OH, THIS DELICATE DANCE OF SEDUCTION AND DENIAL HAS GONE ON FOR SO LONG. I DON'T KNOW IF AMERICA CAN TAKE ANOTHER MINUTE, JUST MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
THIS E-MAIL ENTITLED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT TURNED OUT TO BE A FUND-RAISING LETTER FOR HER FAMILY'S FOUNDATION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT THE -- DID YOU JUST FLY ALL YOUR SUPPORTERS DOWN TO JAMAICA GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE IN FRONT OF ALL OF US, AND THEN JUST PICK UP A QUARTER AND WALK AWAY? WELL, ASSUMING HILLARY IS IN, SHE'S IN, THEN WE CAN GET RID OF ALL THESE OTHER CANDIDATES CLUTTERING UP THE JOINT. THANK YOU. THERE IS JUST NO ONE ELSE WITH THAT KIND OF POLITICAL BRAND RECOGNITION.
JEB BUSH WILL ACTIVELY EXPLORE A PRESIDENTIAL RUN.
JEB BUSH ACTING MORE AND MORE LIKE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
Jon: OH, I GUESS HE'S CONSULTING CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS, BONING UP ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TREATING HIS BROTHER LIKE GEORGE COSTANZA AND DOING THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE? THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD GOVERNING PRINCIPLE, IS THAT WHAT HE IS DOING?
HE RESIGNED FROM ALL OF HIS CORPORATE AND NONPROFIT BOARD POSITIONS.
JEB BUSH HAS CUT HIS CONSULTING TIES TO BARCLAYS, THAT'S THE BIG INTERNATIONAL BRITISH BANK. NOW HE'S QUITTING AS THE DIRECTOR OF TENET HEALTHCARE.
JEB BUSH CONTINUED HIS RESIGNATION FRENZY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW IT'S BECOMING HARDER AND HARDER TO TELL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OR JOINING A CULT. I'M AFRAID THAT IF I WANT TO LIVE IN THE BIG WHITE HOUSE, I HAVE TO RENOUNCE ALL MY EARTHLY TIES. (LAUGHTER) SO ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, APPARENTLY VYING FOR THE MOST POWERFUL POSITION ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH, AND HOW ARE THEY DISPLAYING THEIR QUALIFICATIONS. OH, THEY'RE QUITTING THEIR SHOWS, AND RESIGNING EVERYTHING THEY WERE EVER A PART OF IN ANY WAY, OR FAKING US OUT, I'M GOING TO RUN, I'M TO THE GOING TO RUN. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, THAT IS WHY I, JON STEWART OF THE DAILY SHOW, IS THROWING MY SUPPORT BEHIND SENATOR MELVIN DICKPICTWEET! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
