Jon: A BEST SELLING AUTHOR. MY GUEST TONIGHT HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "DAVID AND GOLIATH" PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MALCOLM GLADWELL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOOD.
Jon: BOOK IS CALLED "DAVID AND GOLIATH." BASICALLY THE PREMISE BEING SOMETIMES BEING DAVID IS A VERY POSITIVE THING. YOU CAN USE THOSE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE IS THAT THE DESIRABLE ADVERSITY --
DIFFICULTIES IS THE PHRASE I USE IN THE BOOK. UIT'S AN EXAMATION OF UNDERDOGS AND THEIR STRATEGIES AND ALSO OF THE IDEA, THE BOOK REALLY ASKS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE HAVE AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IS. LOTS OF THINGS THAT SEEM LIKE DISADVANTAGES CAN BE HIGHLY  ADVANTAGEOUS.
Jon: IN THE BOOK THINGS LIKE DYSLEXIA OR HAVING A CRAPPY CHILDHOOD.
YES. DYSLEXIA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS. MANY PEOPLE WITH DYSLEXIA SUFFER AND IT'S A REAL OBSTACLE TO GET AHEAD IN LIFE. IF YOU LOOK AT GROUPS OF VERY SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS OR PROFESSIONALS YOU'LL FIND A GREATER THAN EXPECTED NUMBER OF DYSLEXICS IN THEIR RANKS. THE NUMBER OF INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, RICHARD BRANSON, CHARLES SCHWAB, THE GUY WHO RUNS -- CISCO -- JOHN CHAMBERS. I COULD GO ON AND ON.
Jon: IF THERE'S ONLY FOUR THAT WOULDN'T BE VERY GOOD.
THERE'S MANY OF THEM. THEY SAY THEY DIDN'T SUCCEED IN SPITE OF DYSLEXIA BUT BECAUSE OF IT. BEING FORCED TO COPE WITH A HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC CHILDHOOD WHERE THEY COULDN'T DO WHAT THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DO, WHICH WAS READ, FORCED THEM TO LEARN MANY OTHER THINGS.
Jon: THERE HAS TO BE A LAFFER CURVE LIKE IN  SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMICS WHERE IT GETS TO A PLACE -- IF I CAN USE A PHRASE I LEARNED IN A DIFFERENT BOOK, A TIPPING POINT. A TIPPING POINT THAT BURIES YOU, BAD CHILDHOOD AND NO MOUTH. THEN YOU PUT HELEN KELLER UP THERE.
I USE THE PHRASE DESIRABLE DIFFICULTY IT'S A LOVELY PHRASE DTHAT TWO PSYCHOLOGISTS AT UCLA HAVE COME UP WITH TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE KIND THAT PROVE ADVANTAGEOUS AND UNDESIRABLE DIFFICULTIES,S WHICH ARE NOT THE KIND OF THING ANYONE SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM.
Jon: I'M SURE SOME PEOPLE DO. THE HUMAN SPIRIT INCREDIBLY ADAPTABLE. DON'T WE ALL HAVE TO SOME EXTENT DISADVANTAGES THAT SHAPE OUR CHARACTER AS WE GO THROUGH AND IT IS SORT OF TENACITY WITH WHICH YOU OVERCOME THEM NO  MATTER WHAT THAT WOULD BE?
I GOT STARTED ON THIS BECAUSE MY LAST BOOK "OUTLIERS" BECAUSE I SPENT TIME TALKING TO SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. I WAS STRUCK BY HOW OFTEN WHEN THEY ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT THEY HAD ACHIEVED THEY BEGAN WITH THE DIFFICULTIES NOT THE OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES. SO MUCH OF THEIR SENSE OF THEMSELVES WAS SOMETHING THAT GREW OUT OF -- IN SOME CASES IT GREWWAS A TERRIBLE BLOW THAT IT HAPPENED TO THEM THAT THEY MANAGED SOMEHOW TO NAVIGATE. THE CHAPTER HERE ON PARENTAL LOSS. ON THIS STRIKING FACT THAT VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS HAVE LOST A PARENT IN CHILDHOOD, WAY HIGHER THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED FROM THE NORMAL POPULATION.
REALLY.
IT'S JUST ABOUT THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A HUMAN BEING.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING IF MY SON WANTS IT BE PRESIDENT -- OH, BOY. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS THE THING. I SHUT THE LIGHTS AND I CLOSE MY EYES AROUND THIS KID.
LOOK BILL CLINTON, OBAMA, THESE ARE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- BUT THE LIST IS EXTRAORDINARILY LONG. WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND IS THAT THESE ARE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DISTINGUISHES THESE PEOPLE IS THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THEM THAT TOOK THE DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE AND FOUND A WAY TO COME OUT STRONGER.
Jon: IS IT A CHICKEN AND THE EGG? IS THERE A WAY OF DETERMINING IF THERE'S AN INHERENT PERSONALITY TYPE THAT IS ABLE TO TRANSLATE THE DEVASTATING BLOWS INTO A POSITIVE OUTCOME OR WHETHER  HE BLOW INFLUENCES THE OUTCOME.
I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU WROTE THE BOOK?
THERE'S SO MUCH I DON'T KNOW. THESE BOOKS ALWAYS RAISE MORE QUESTIONS THAN THEY RESOLVE. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO, RIGHT? THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO KIND OF START. IT WOULD BE REALLY FASCINATING. I DIDN'T DO IT. NOW I THINK I SHOULD HAVE. TO SIT DOWN NEXT TO BILL CLINTON AND ASK THAT QUESTION. HERE IS A GUY WHO HAD THE FURTHEST THING FROM A SILVER SPOON IN HIS MOUTH.
Jon: NO QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WOULD SHARE HIS STORY. HE'S VERY RETICENT ABOUT THAT.
VERY SHY.
Jon: YOU MIGHT GET A COUPLE THINGS. YOU MIGHT BE LIKE THE BOOK IS TOO BIG LAST. LAUGH RAISES TONS OF QUESTIONS AND I THINK IS A NICE WAY TO LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, THAT OLD ADAGE THE LEMONS AND LEMONADE, THAT SORT OF THING. DAVID AND GOLIATH. BE A DAVID, WHY NOT. MALCOLM GLADWELL
