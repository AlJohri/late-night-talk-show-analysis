( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER SENATOR  FROM WYOMING, ALSO THE COCHAIR  OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND  REFORM, ALSO KNOWN AS THE  SIMPSON/BOWLES PLAN, PLEASE WELCOME, SENATOR ALLAN SIMPSON. SIR.
YUCK MAN.    YOUNG MAN.
HOW ARE YOU?
Jon:  NICE TO SEE YOU,  SENATOR, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, I SAW THAT LAST  SEGMENT. I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WOULD LIVEN  EVERYTHING UP FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER ). I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT. THAT WOULDN'T BE A THING TO DO.
Jon:  NEXT TIME I'LL MAKE  SURE IT'S IN THE GIFT BAG FOR  EVERYBODY. ( LAUGHTER ).
MAYBE JUST THE COOKIES.
Jon:  JUST THE COOKIES. ( LAUGHTER ). SO LET ME-- LET ME START WITH  YOU. TWO YEARS AGO, TWO AND A HALF  YEARS AGO, YOU ARE APROASMED TO  AIR A COMMIT WEERSKINE BOWLSROACHED TOCH TO SET UP A DEFICIT REDUCTION  PLAN FOR THE COUNTRY. YOU STUDY IT. YOU'RE VERY DILIGENT. EVERYBODY HATES IT WITHIN 24  HOURS. THE DEMOCRATS SAY IT'S TOO  AUSTERE. THE REPUBLICANS SAY YOU'RE  RAISING TAX TOO MUCH. TWO YEARS LATER AS WE STAND ON  THE PRECIPICEAVE CLIFF, SUDDENLY  THIS PLAN AS SEEN AS THE MOSTERABLY THING IN TOWN AND  PEOPLE ARE COMING TO YOU TO FIND  OUT YOUR SAGE ADVICE. WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE TWO  YEARS?
WELL, THE PEOPLE WOKE UP. I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE ARE WAKING  UP. YOU CAN'T DO THIS. YOU CAN'T TAX YOUR WAY OUT OF  THIS HOLE. YOU CAN'T GROW YOUR WAY OUT OF  THIS HOLE. WE HAD EVERY ECONOMIST SAY YOU  COULD HAVE DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH  FOR 20 YEARS AND CAN'T GET OUT OF THE HOLE. YOU CAN'T CUT SPENDING OUT OF  YOUR HOLE. WE GOT FIVE DEMOCRATS, FIVE  REPUBLICANS, RANGING FROM DICK  DURBIN TO ILLINOIS-- GREAT PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT-- AND  COBURN FROM OKLAHOMA, AND FIVE  DEMS, FIVE REPUBLICANS, ONE INDEPENDENT, THAT'S A SUPER  MAJORITY. AND FOR GOD'S SAKE THE REASON WE  WERE SO SUCCESSFUL IS THAT WE  EFFECTIVELY PISSED OFF EVERYBODY IN AMERICA. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  CONGRATULATIONS,  SIR. KUDOS. KUDOS TO YOU. ( APPLAUSE )  SO NOW, AS YOU WATCH THESE  COMPETING PLANS, YOU WATCH THE  PRESIDENT HAS SUBMITTED HIS OPENING OFFER, WHICH HAS BEEN  DERIDED BY THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS  AS AN ODE TO LENNON. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PRESENTED  THEIR PLAN, WHICH IS TO MY EYES,  STEEPER THAN THE FISCAL CLIFF WE'RE ABOUT TO FALL OFF OF. WHERE DOES THE SIMPSON/BOWLES  RECOMMENDATION STAND, AND ARE  THEY COMING TO YOU NOW AND SAYING, "OH, WE FORGOT. YOU GUYS STUDIED THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, WE STUDIED IT FOR EIGHT  MONTHS. AND IT WAS TOUGH. WE DIDN'T-- WE HAD-- IT TOOK US  THREE MONTHS TO ESTABLISH TRUST. THESE GUYS DON'T TRUST EACH  OTHER. THEY DON'T EVEN TRUST EACH OTHER  IN THEIR OWN PARTY. YOU'VE GOT LEADERS WHO ARE  PEOPLE BEHIND THEM WITH A SHIVE  HOPING THEY CAN GET THEIR JOB NEXT GO-AROUND. POOR OLD DURBIN HAS SOMEONE  LOOKING OVER HIS BACK BECAUSE HE  VOTED FOR THE PACKAGE. EVERY TIME THEY DEAL AND OVER IN  THE REPUBLICANS, BOEHNER HAS TO  GO TO WORK AND COME BACK AND THERE'S-- NOW THERE ARE 70 OF  THEM LEFT, THE TEA PARTY GUYS. THESE ARE GUYS WHO WENT TO  CONGRESS NOT TO LIMIT GOVERNMENT  BUT TO STOP IT. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? AND SO HERE WE HAVE THIS PLAN. EVERYBODY SAYS "I LOVE THE  FRAMEWORK. I JUST LOVE--"
Jon:  EVERYBODY LOVES A  GOOD FRAMEWORK.
AND THEN THAT WILL SAY WHAT  DID YOU DO WITH HOME MORTGAGE  INTEREST DEDUCTIONS. IT WILL BE THE END OF HOME  OWNERSHIP. WE SAID YOU DON'T NEED A MILLION  BUCKS OF HOME HOARNLG INTEREST  DEDUCTION. WE'LL TAKE IT DOWN TO 500,000,  AND A 12% NONREFUNDABLE TAX  CREDIT AND THAT HELPS THE LITTLE  GUY. IF EVERYBODY WOULD DO SOMETHING  FOR THE LITTLE GUY INSTEAD OF  TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY, WE MIGHT MAKE IT.
Jon:  THE LITTLE GUY  MIGHT GET BIGGER.
MIGHT GET BIGGER  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  THERE'S SO MUCH  TALK-- AND EVEN IN  SIMPSON/BOWLES, THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT CORPORATE TAX RATES  AND LOWERING THEM AND MAKING  THEM MORE COMPETITIVE. IN MY EYE, CORPORATIONS HAVE  HAD, OVER THESE LAST 20 YEARS,  THE RUN OF THE PLACE. THEY HAVE-- IF YOU LOOK AT IT  FACTUALLY, CORPORATE PROFITS ARE  AT AN ALL-TIME HO-- ALL-TIME  HIGH. THAT WAS-- THAT WAS A FREUDIAN  SLIP OF PROPORTIONS. CORPORATIONS ARE ALL-TIME HO'S. NO, BUT THEIR PROFITS ARE AT AN  ALL-TIME HIGH. WORKER WAGES HAVE STAGNATED EVEN  AS PRODUCTIVITY HAS GONE UP. SO I GUESS I'M CONFUSED AS TO  WHY WE ARE CHASING THEIR FAVOR  WHEN THEY SEEM TO HAVE HAD SUCH A GOOD RUN OVER THESE PAST 20 OR  30 YEARS.
YEAH, WELL, OUR CORPORATE TAX  RATE IS THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD  --
BUT NOT ACTUALLY.
WELL, 36% IS WHERE WE'RE AT. WHAT WE DID, WE TOOK AWAY ALL OF  THESE TAX EXPENDITURES, ALL OF  THESE DEDUCTIONS, ALL OF THIS  STUFF. THIS IS JUST EARMARKS BY ANY  OTHER NAME, AND IT'S SPENDING BY  ANY OTHER NAME, AND IT'S $1.1 TRILLION A YEAR. AND ONLY 20% OF THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE USE 80% OF THE STUFF IN  THAT TAX CODE. DOES THAT GIVE YOU THE WAKE-UP  CALL WHO IS GIMMING THE SYSTEM? WE GOT RID OF ALL THAT AND GIVE  PEOPLE FROM 0-70 GRAND, 8%. 70,000 TO 210,000, THEY PAY 14,  EVERYTHING OVER THAT, 23. TAKE THE CORPORATE RATE FROM 26  TO 36 AND NOT TAX THEM TWICE  WHEN THEY BRING IT BACK. AND WHEN THEY BRING IT BACK,  WHEN THE DEMOCRATS-- AS ERR SKIN  SAYS A DEMOCRAT-- THEY'LL JUST USE IT FOR DIVIDENDS TO BUY  STOCKS AND HE SAID AT LEAST  THEY'LL BE USING IT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA INSTEAD  OF STICKING OVER THERE.
Jon:  OR THAIDGED OF THEY  COULD USE IT FOR BONUSES.
THEY'LL DO ALL THAT.
Jon:  BETWEEN AND YOU I,  AND YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN, BETWEEN  AND YOU ME, THEY REALLY ARE THE CRAZY PEOPLE IN THIS ONE. ARE THEY NOT?
NO, THE AARP SPSS ARE THE  CRAZY PEOPLE.
Jon:  DON'T SAY THAT  BECAUSE I JUST JOINED. YOU CAN STICK AROUND A LITTLE  BIT. WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE WITH  SENATOR CAPITOL HILL  KENNEDYICISM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (
