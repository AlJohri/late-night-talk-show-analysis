FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. CHEERS [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON  STEWART WHO IS AWAY THIS SUMMER  FILMING A "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC" SPECIAL SLOWLY GAINING THE TRUST  OF A FAMILY OF MEERCATS. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MARK LEAVE  VEITCH AUTHOR OF "THIS TOWN" IS  WITH US. IT'S A BRILLIANT EXPOSE OF HOW  WASHINGTON D.C. TURNS OUT TO BE  EXACTLY AS AWFUL AS EVERYONE THINKS IT IS. BUT WE START TONIGHT IN RUSSIA. WITH EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE FORMER  N.S.A. CONTRACTOR TURNED WHISTLE  BLOWER AND ALSO OF THE UPCOMING LONELY PLANET TERMINAL-D OF THE  MOSCOW AIRPORT. SO WHAT HAS HE BEEN UP TO APART  FROM NOTHING?
RUSSIAN NEWS AGENCIES  REPORTED THAT SNOWDEN WOULD GET  A SPECIAL I.D. CARD OR DOCUMENT OF SOME KIND THAT WOULD ALLOW  HIM TO FINALLY LEAVE THE AIRPORT  TRANSIT ZONE. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LAWYER  WASN'T CARRYING ANY SUCH I.D. CARD. HE DID HAVE SOME FRESH CLOTHES  FOR US, SOME PIZZA AND A COUPLE  OF BOOKS BY CHECK OFTEN.
John: THAT'S NICE BECAUSE  NOTHING LIGHTENS A MAN'S SPIRITS  LIKE THEODORE. I THINK YOU'LL FIND HIM IN  BARNES AND ENABLE'S MISERY  SECTION. TAKE THAT. NOW YOU UNDERSTAND SUFFERING. I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH YOU,  CHECKOV. NO PROBLEM. BUT LIKE A HOTEL PHONE RINGING  AT 5:30 A.M. BECAUSE YOU  SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED IT, SNOWDEN HAS PROVIDED A REAL  WAKE-UP CALL. (LAUGHING). HE'S FORCED AMERICANS TO EXAMINE  THE TRADE-OFFS WE'VE MADE  BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND NOT HAVING THE GOVERNMENT LISTEN  INTO OUR PRIVATE PHONE CALLS  WITH 55 [BLEEP]. I TOLD THAT IN CONFIDENCE ABOUT  MY PRIVATE MEDICAL HISTORY. I'M CONCERNED. I'M CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY ONE  CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LEVEL OF  GOVERNMENT INTRUSION.
NEW NBC WALL STREET JOURNAL  POLL SHOWS THE PUBLIC GROWING  MORE WEARY KNOW THE GOVERNMENT COULD GO TOO FAR IN ITS  SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS AND  VIOLATE PRIVACY RIGHTS. FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW A  MAJORITY 56% NOW SAY THEY ARE  WORRIED THAT THE U.S. MONITORING PROGRAMS WILL GO TOO FAR.
John: RIGHT. AND THE REALLY CONCERNING THING  THERE, THE DATA GATHERED IN THAT  POLL DIDN'T COME THROUGH A  SURVEY. THEY JUST KNOW WHAT YOU THINK  NOW. LUCKILY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN  CONGRESS WHO ARE PAYING  ATTENTION.
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR  STATEMENTS FROM REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN JUSTIN AMASH AND THE RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JON CONYERS  WHO ARE INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO LIMIT THE COLLECTION OF PHONE  RECORDS AND TO FORCE SECRET  NATIONAL SECURITY COURT OPINIONS TO BE PUBLIC.
THIS STRANGE COALITION, VERY  LIBERAL AND VERY CONSERVATIVE. YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR THAT THESE  DAYS.
John: THAT'S RIGHT. NOT ONLY IS CONGRESS ACTUALLY  RESPONDING TO THIS CANDLE,  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THAT FEELS STRANGE. IT'S LIKE WHEN AN ANIMAL BECOMES  FRIENDS WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT  ANIMAL. IT'S LOVELY TO SEE BUT SOMETHING  ABOUT IT JUST FEELS WRONG. SURE, MAYBE THEY'RE GOING TO  WORK TOGETHER TO GET A BANANA  OUT OF A TREE BUT CALL ME  CYNICAL. ONCE THAT FRUIT HITS THE GROUND  YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A  DEAD BIRD AND A BLIND MONKEY. BOTH LAYING NEXT TO A ROTTEN  BANANA. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS MAGICAL  AMENDMENT THAT HAS BROUGHT  EVERYONE TOGETHER?
WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ONE  QUESTION FOR THE PEOPLE WE  REPRESENT. DO WE OPPOSE THE SUSPICION LIST  COLLECTION OF EVERY AMERICANS'  PHONE RECORDS. MY AMENDMENT MAKES A SIMPLE BUT  UPON CHANGE. IT LIMITS THE GOVERNMENT'S  COLLECTION OF THOSE RECORDS... OF THE RECORDS SO THOSE RECORDS  THAT PERTAIN TO A PERSON WHO IS  IS THE SUBJECT OF AN  INVESTIGATION.
John: NO LONGER WILL WE ALLOW  THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE OUR  PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE WILL KEEP IT WHERE IT  BELONGS: ON FACEBOOK. ON GOOGLE. ON TWITTER. ON INSTAGRAM. ON LINKED-IN. EVEN THOUGH I KEEP TELLING  LINKED-IN TO STOP SENDING ME  EMAILS. LEAVE ME ALONE, LINKED-IN. I'M ON TELEVISION. UNSUBSCRIBE... SUBSCRIBE. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU  DO, LINKED IN. YOU SEEM TO HAVE MONETIZED  IRRITATING PEOPLE. NEVERTHELESS, THIS PROPOSED  AMENDMENT TRIGGERED ONE OF THE  RAREST SIGHTS IN NATURE. WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS HAS  NEVER BEEN CAUGHT ON CAMERA  BEFORE: DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BOTH NATURAL  PREDATORS FEASTING ON THE SAME  TALKING POINT.
WHAT IT DOES DO IS PREVENT  THE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE  NOT SUBJECT TO INVESTIGATION.
MANY AMERICANS FEEL THAT OUR  FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES AS A  COUNTRY AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE THREATENED.
WHAT THEY'RE DOING VIOLATES  THE FOURTH AMENDMENT.
BEN FRANKLIN SAID THEY WHO  GIVE UP ESSENTIAL LIBERTIES TO  OBTAIN A LITTLE TEMPORARY  SAFETY.
THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO TRADE  LIBERTY FOR SECURITY WILL FIND  THEY HAVE NEITHER.
John: SIDE NOTE. IT TURNS OUT WATCHING C-SPAN  WITH BINOCULARS IS EXACTLY AS  BORING AS WATCHING C-SPAN WITHOUT BINOCULARS. SO, LOOK, THAT'S GREAT NEWS FOR  THIS BUILDING BECAUSE WE ALL  KNOW IF YOU CAN GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR SOMETHING IT'S GOING  TO PASS. UNLESS ANOTHER BIPARTISAN GROUP  EMERGES TO FIGHT IT. BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S GOING  TO HAPPEN. IS THERE IN ROLL THE TAPE.
THE TOP THREE REPUBLICANS IN  THE HOUSE OPPOSE THE MEASURE.
A TOP REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT  OF THE COMMITTEE RELEASED A  JOINT STATEMENT CALLING IT  UNWISE. A WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A  STATEMENT URGING THE HOUSE TO  REJECT IT.
John: JOHN BOEHNER AND  PRESIDENT OBAMA AGREE ON  SOMETHING. THE ONLY OTHER THINGS THEY'VE  EVER AGREED ON WERE, ONE,  ESTIMATION YOU NEED A GOOD CRY. TWO, MICHAEL KEATON IS IS A BEST  BATMAN AND THREE, BRAZIL NUTS  ARE NOTHING MORE THAN PACKING MATERIAL FOR ALL THE OTHER NUTS  IN THE MIX. SO THEY GOT A FOUR. NOTHING SHOWS THOUGH JUST HOW  WEIRD THESE COALITIONS HAVE  BECOME THAN THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT ALSO ENDED UP ON THE  SAME SIDE AS THIS PERSON.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS  TAKING IN THE CONTENT OF  AMERICAN PHONE CALLS. IT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. WE NEED TO DEAL IN FACTS. LET'S DEAL IN REALITY, NOT IN  FALSE NARRATIVES.
John: YES, YES. WAIT, WAIT. YOU'RE JUMPING AHEAD. YOU HEARD KROACTLY. MICHELLE BACHMAN JUST ARGUED  WHAT WE SHOULDN'T DEAL IN FALSE  NARRATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FALSE NARRATIVE  THAT SAYS MICHELLE BACHMAN  DOESN'T DEAL IN FALSE  NARRATIVES.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES WILL BE TAKING A TRIP  OVER TO INDIA THAT IS IS EXPECTED TO COST THE TAX PAYER  DLZ 200 MILLION A DAY. HER LITTLE DAUGHTER TOOK THAT  VACCINE, THAT INJECTION AND SHE  SUFFERED FROM MENTAL RETARDATION  THEREAFTER. THE VERY FOUNDERS THAT WROTE  THOSE DOCUMENTS WORKED  TIRELESSLY UNTIL SLAVERY WAS NO  MORE. THEY USE THE U.S. CENSUS  INFORMATION TO ROUND UP THE  JAPANNESE AND PUT THEM IN THE INTERNMENT CAMPS. THERE ISN'T EVEN ONE STUDY THAT  CAN BE PRODUCED THAT SHOWS THAT  CARBON DIOXIDE IS A HARMFUL GAS.
John: THAT IS A WAKE-UP CALL. YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN  MICHELLE BACHMAN IS ON YOUR  SIDE, YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT THE SIDE THAT YOU ARE ON. SHE IS THE CANARY IN THE CRAZY  MINE. I MYSELF WEAR A BRACELET  EVERYDAY THAT READS WHAT  WOULDN'T MICHELLE BACHMAN DO. SO, LOOK, 56% OF THE PUBLIC SEEM  TO BE IN FAVOR OF THE AMENDMENT  RESTRICTING THE GOVERNMENT'S PHONE DATA COLLECTION. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.
THE N.S.A.'S CONTROVERSIAL  SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM IS HERE TO  STAY. WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE HOUSE VOTED  DOWN AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD  HAVE DEFUNDED THE PROGRAM THAT COLLECTS DATA ON AMERICANS'  PHONE RECORDS.
John: THIS IS THE WORKS. YES. THIS IS THE WORKS. ONCE AGAIN, CONGRESS FAILS TO  GET SOMETHING DONE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THIS  TIME THEY FAILED TO GET IT DONE  TOGETHER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
