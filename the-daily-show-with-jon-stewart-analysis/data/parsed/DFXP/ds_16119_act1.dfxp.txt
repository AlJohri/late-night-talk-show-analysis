SEPTEMBER 21, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, DO WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, MITCH DANIELS. HE IS THE CURRENT GOVERNOR OF INDIANA AND THE GUY THAT EVERY OTHER REPUBLICAN SAYS, "MAN, I  WISH THAT GUY WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT."  [LAUGHTER] BUT AT LEAST MAYBE VICE PRESIDENT. BUT LET'S START IN WASHINGTON. THEY ENJOY THAT. MONDAY MORNING PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK TO THE WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN, WHERE APPEARING IN FRONT  OF THE VERY DOORKNOBS THAT MIGHT BE HITTING HIM IN THE ASS NEXT NOVEMBER, HE TALKED DEATH AND TAXES.
TODAY I'M LAYING OUT A SET OF SPECIFIC PROPOSALS TO FINISH  WHAT WE STARTED THIS SUMMER.
Jon: YOU MEAN FORT AWESOME? [LAUGHTER] TREEHOUSE I WAS BIDDING ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN.
IT'S A PLAN THAT REDUCES OUR DEBT BY MORE THAN $4 TRILLION  AND ACHIEVES THESE SAVINGS IN A WAY THAT'S FAIR.
Jon: WHAT WE'LL DO IS ONE AT A TIME EXCUSE OURSELVES TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. THEN WE WILL CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW AND INTO CANADA. [LAUGHTER] SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
IT COMES DOWN TO THIS: WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE. EITHER WE ASK THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE IN TAXES, OR WE HAVE TO  ASK SENIORS TO PAY MORE FOR MEDICARE. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO BOTH. EITHER WE GUT EDUCATION AND MEDICAL RESEARCH, OR WE'VE GOT TO REFORM THE TAX CODE SO THAT  THE MOST PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS HAVE TO GIVE UP TAX LOOPHOLES THAT OTHER COMPANIES DON'T GET. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO BOTH. THIS IS NOT CLASS WARFARE. IT'S MATH. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS: BARACK OBAMA KNOWS ONE THING. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG APPEALING TO AMERICANS' LOVE OF MATH. [LAUGHTER] PROBABLY SOMETHING HE STOLE BASED ON THE HUGELY POPULAR ONLINE ROLE PLAYING GAME "WORLD  OF MATHCRAFT." MY CHARACTER RHOMBUS WEARS THE PYTHAGORAS HAT. THAT'S HOW YOUR GOING TO SELL YOUR PROGRAM? IT'S NOT WAR, THE THING WE'RE BEST AT, IT'S MATH, THE THING  WE'RE 365th IN THE WORLD AT, OR AS WE LIKE TO THINK OF IT, THE TOP 10%. THE PRESIDENT HAS DRAWN STARK POLICY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS OPPONENT. WE MUST RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY OR RISK THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR 07-YEAR SAFETY SOCIAL NET. THE REPUBLICANS MUST BE ABLE TO COUNTER THIS BY PUTTING A HUMAN FACE ON THE BURDEN THIS WILL  PLACE ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE WEALTHY. CUE LOUISIANA GOVERNOR REPUBLICAN AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF A SMALL BUSINESS  SANDWICH SHOT JOHN FLEMING.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" ESTIMATED YOUR BUSINESS, A SUBWAY SANDWICH SHOP, BREAKTHROUGH YOU LAST YEAR OVER $6 MILLION.
YEAH, THAT'S BEFORE YOU PLAY 500 EMPLOYEES. THE AMOUNT I HAVE TO REINVEST IN MY BUSINESS IS $600,000 OF THAT $6.3 MILLION. BY THE TIME I FEED MY FAMILY, I HAVE MAYBE $400,000 LEFT OVER TO UPGRADE, BUY MORE EQUIPMENT. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. LET'S IGNORE FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS GENTLEMAN SEEMS TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLY [BLEEPED] ACCOUNTANT  WHO HAS ADVISED HIM TO PAY PERSONAL INCOME TAX ON MONEY HE REINVESTS IN HIS BUSINESS, BLOW  PAST THE FACT THAT UNDER OBAMA'S PLAN ENSTEAD OF HAVING $400,000  YOU'D HAVE $381,000, LET'S FOCUS ON THE $200,000 YOU SAY A YEAR  YOU NEED TO FAY YOUR FAMILY. NOW --  [LAUGHTER] I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW. THERE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BUY A FULL 12 INCHES OF MEAT SUBFOR $5. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW, BY MY CALCULATIONS, $200,000 WILL BUY YOU 40,000 FEET OF FOOD. THAT IS EIGHT MILES OF ROOM TEMPERATURE HONEY CURED TECHNICALLY, TURKEY. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF THESE PLACES. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE! SO PROBLEM SOLVED.
AGAIN, IF YOU GO AFTER THE HIGHER-INCOME EARNER, YOU'RE ALSO GOING AFTER THE JOB  CREATORS, SO WHATEVER IS CUT OUT OF THOSE EARNINGS IS MONEY TAKEN OUT OF CAPITAL FOR REN  INVESTMENT FOR CREATING MORE JOBS, OPENING UP MORE LOCATIONS.
Jon: MORE LOCATIONS AT LONG LAST, SIR? WE DON'T NEED MORE SUBWAYS. I'LL SHOW YOU, WE SENT WYATT CENAC TO THE NEAREST SUBWAY. WYATT, WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
I'M RIGHT HERE, JON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BY THE WAY, THE ONLY REASON THEY OPENED A SUBWAY NEXT TO OUR STUDY ROW IS THE ONE  INSIDE OUR STUDIO COULDN'T HANDLE ALL THE BUSINESS. IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE. YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE IT ON CAMERA. BUT IT SMELLS LIKE A LEFT OF BREAD TOOK A [BLEEPED]. SO THAT'S FINE. TAXES GO UP. [LAUGHTER] TAXES GO UP. YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF AT TIMES MORE THAN 20 SANDWICH LENGTHS AWAY FROM THE NEXT SUBWAY STORE. THEY ARE PLENTIFUL. BUT THERE IS SADLY ONLY ONE PAPA BEAR.
IF YOU TAX ACHIEVEMENT, SOME OF THE ACHIEVERS ARE GOING TO PACK IT IN. AGAIN, LET'S TAKE ME. MY CORPORATIONS EMPLOY SCORES OF PEOPLE. THEY DEPEND ON ME TO DO WHAT I DO SO THEY CAN MAKE A NICE SALARY. IF BARACK OBAMA BEGINS TAXING ME MORE THAN 50%, WHICH IS VERY POSSIBLE, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH  LONGER I'M GOING TO DO THIS. I LIKE MY JOB BUT THERE COMES A POINT WHERE TAXATION BECOMES OPPRESSIVE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO IF TAXES ARE RAIDS, BILL O'REILLY MIGHT QUIT HIS FOX JOB? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELL, THAT, THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, NO, STOP, BILL, DON'T, PLEASE. NO. [LAUGHTER] I SHOULDN'T POKE FUN. BILL IS JUST STANDING UP FOR A SHRINKING EXPLOITED MINORITY.
RIGHT NOW TAXPAYERS WITH INCOMES ABOVE $1 MILLION REPRESENT JUST .2%, NOT 2%, .2%  OF ALL INCOME TAX RETURNS. YET THE MILLION DOLLAR BABIES PAY 21% OF ALL THE FEDERAL INCOME TAXES.
MILLIONAIRES ARE DISAPPEARING FROM AMERICA.
Jon: THE SUPER RICH WILL GO EXTINCT. WE'D ADD THEM TO THE ENGLAND DANGERRERED SPECIES LIST, BUT YOU NOW HOW MUCH THEY DESPISE  GOVERNMENT REGULATION. OH, CRUEL IRONY. PEOPLE, EVERY DAY AMERICA LOSES MORE AND MORE MILLIONAIRES TO ABUSIVE INDIVIDUAL AND CORPED  RAT TAX BREAKS. THEIR HABITATS ARE SLOWLY DISAPPEARING. THEIR WATERING HOLES ARE DRYING UP. IF WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY, THESE ONCE-PLENTIFUL CREATURES WILL BE RELEGATED TO ZOOS AND  HEARTBREAKING DOCUMENTARIES. HI, I'M JON STEWART. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] WILL YOU BE AN ANGEL FOR A HELPLESS MULTIMILLIONAIRE? EVERY DAY JAMES MERIWEATHER PHILLIPS, JAMES TO OUR DOMESTIC STAFF, AND THOUSANDS MORE LIKE  HIM LIVE IN FEAR THAT THE TOP MARGINAL TAX RATE WILL BE RAISED FROM ITS CURRENT 35% TO 39.6%. BUT YOU CAN HELP. FOR JUST MOST OF WHAT YOU EARN IN A YEAR, YOU CAN HELP JAMES MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE. CALL NOW BECAUSE HE WANTS THE MONEY NOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
