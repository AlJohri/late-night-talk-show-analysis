[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OH, WELCOME BACK. I WANT THE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING NEAR TO MY HEART, GERMANS. EASY PEOPLE TO LOVE, THE HUMOR, THE LANGUAGE, THEIR WHIMSICAL DEDICATION TO RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY. BUT RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE COOLED. JASON JONES HAS MORE.
EVER SINCE PUTIN ANNEXED CRIMEA, THE U.S. HAS BEEN URGING ALLIES IN THE E.U. TO GET TOUGHER WITH RUSSIA, BUT SOME OF OUR SUPPOSED FRIENDS LIKE GERMANY HAVE BEEN REACTING A LITTLE SLOWER THAN WE'D LIKE, SO I MET WITH ACTING GERMAN AMBASSADOR PHILIP ACKERMAN TO SEE JUST WHAT'S GOING ON.
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THERE'S MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BETWEEN GERMANY AND RUSSIA THAN BETWEEN THE AMERICANS AND RUSSIA. AND IF YOU SEE THE POLES, THEN YOU'LL SEE THAT THE GERMAN PEOPLE TEND TO HAVE A SORT OF A MORE APOLOGETIC VIEW OF WHAT PUTIN DID.
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE CLOSER TO THEM THAN YOU ARE TO US?
NO. OH, OH, OH. I WOULD HAVE TO...
THAT'S THE EXACT EMPHATIC RESPONSE I WAS LOOKING FOR.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE AN OLD RELATION WITH RUSSIA. WHICH JUST CAN'T, YOU CAN'T THROW IT AWAY.
REMEMBER, THOUGH, WE WERE THE ONES WHO SAID,  "ICH BIN EIN BERLINER."
YEAH.
OK. THE OTHER GUYS, THEY, WELL...
THEY PUT A WALL UP.
AND THEY ALSO SHOT YOU WHEN YOU TRIED TO RUN AWAY.
YEAH. I MEAN, YES, THAT'S TRUE. YEAH.
JUST REMEMBER WHO THE GOOD GUYS ARE.
DON'T WORRY.
OKAY. IF WE'RE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
I MEAN, THERE'S CERTAIN DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TRUST IN AMERICA AMONGST THE GERMAN PUBLIC DROPPED. IF WE WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER, IF WE ARE FRIENDS AND ALLIES, ONE SHOULD NOT SPY ON YOUR FRIENDS.
WE'RE NOT SPYING ON YOU.
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY EVIDENCE THAT YOU ARE SPYING ON US.
COME ON. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS OLD THING, IS HE?
THE CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA TO STOP TAPPING HER PHONE.
GERMAN LEADER SAID TRUST IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SHATTERED AND WILL NEED TO BE REBUILT.
BUT IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, THEN WHY SHOULD THEY CARE ABOUT US SPYING ON THEM. DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD EVER BE A REASON ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY FOR US NOT TO TRUST YOU?
GENERALLY SPEAKING, I WOULD SAY THAT GERMANY AND AMERICA HAVE BEEN SO CLOSE ALLIES THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO...
YOU CAN'T THINK OF MAYBE ONE...
NOT TO TRUST US?
OR TWO REASONS?
NO. IT'S A SENTIMENTAL THING. PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, THE FRIENDSHIP STARTS IN 1945, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE U.S. WERE THE ONES WHO REALLY GAVE US A SECOND CHANCE.
YOU MEAN THIRD.
AND WE ARE IMMENSELY GRATEFUL FOR THAT, AND...
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DID SEE, WHAT DID YOU WANT US TO NOT SEE?
I AM NOT AN INTELLIGENCE GUY.
DID YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE, THOUGH?
NO. YOU SAID "NOT SEE." NAZI.
THAT'S RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW, THEY WERE ACTUALLY RIGHT, FRIENDS SHOULD NEVER SPY ON EACH OTHER.
GERMAN PRESS REPORTS SUGGEST THE COUNTRY'S INTELLIGENCE AGENCY SPIED ON TURKEY FOR YEARS.
MOTHER [BLEEPED] WERE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING YOU WERE, WHICH MEANS WE'RE MEANT FOR ONE ANOTHER. IT WAS TIME TO FULLY HEAL THIS DIVIDE IN A WAY ALL AMERICANS AND GERMANS WOULD APPRECIATE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
YEAH, I HAVE THIS STRONG FEELING TOO, ACTUALLY.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, YOU DON'T WANT THE LOSE OUT ON ALL WE HAVE TO OFFER, RIGHT? I MEAN, THE GERMANS, YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT BEER. AND HERE IN AMERICA, WE'VE GOT BUD LIGHT LIME A RITA.
WHAT IS THIS?
OH, IT'S PART BEER, PART MARGARITA, ALL PARTY.
DO THEY OPEN?
YEAH, YOU BET. LET'S DO THIS. TO AMERICA AND GERMANY. DRINKING THE BEST BEER ON THE PLANET. [LAUGHTER] YEP, IT WILL DO THAT.
THIS IS TERRIBLE.
UH-HUH. SURE IS, TERRIBLY GOOD.
I'M SO SORRY, BUT I CAN'T DRINK THAT.
OKAY. SO THAT'S NOT YOU SPEED. ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU TRY A STRAWBERITA.
OH NO, NO, NO, PLEASE DON'T. I MEAN, WE HAVE A GOOD FRIENDSHIP AND EVERYTHING, BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE THAT ON ME.
SO THE BEER SUMMIT DIDN'T WORK, BUT THERE WAS ONE MORE IDEA THAT COULD FIX ALL OF. THIS LET'S DO A LITTLE TRUST EXERCISE. HAVE YOU EVER DONE A TRUST ALL BEFORE?
NO.
HAVE A STAND UP, TURN AROUND, TURN AROUND. YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS ONE. OK. NOW I WANT YOU TO CLOSE YOUR EYES. JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES AND YOU'RE GOING TO TRUST ME. WE USED TO DO IT IN THEATER SCHOOL. IT WAS A LOT OF FUN. BASICALLY I STAND BACK AND THEN YOU FALL AND YOU TRUST THAT I'M GOING TO CATCH YOU. IT'S A THING TO BRING US BACK TOGETHER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE DONE, JUST LIKE THAT, WAY TO GO. HAVE A SEAT.
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T ASK ME TO FALL.
I DIDN'T NEED YOU TO FALL BECAUSE I GOT ALL I NEEDED. SEE, THAT'S TRUST.
WELL.
YOU KNOW, WHAT FRIENDS SHOULDN'T SPY ON ONE ANOTHER. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BEST FRIENDS.
JASON JONES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
