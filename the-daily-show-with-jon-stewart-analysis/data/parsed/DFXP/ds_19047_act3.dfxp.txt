Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE'RE TALKING TO FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT GATES. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IN THESE YEARS AS A SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR BUSH AND OBAMA FACED DOWN PRETTY FEARSOME ADVERSARIES, THE IRAQ WAR RECONSTRUCTION, THE TALIBAN RESURGENCE BUT YOU TALK ABOUT A FIGHT WITH A REALLY TERRIFYING OPPONENT, THE V.A. BUREAUCRACY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHEN THEY COME HOME IN THE MANNER THAT THEY DESERVE? AND WHY IS IT -- WHY CAN WE MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- WHY CAN WE MOBILIZE SO QUICKLY AND SO WELL FOR INTERVENTION BUT NOT FOR BACKLOGS OF PAPERWORK? WHAT IS THAT DIFFICULT?
I WRITE IN THE BOOK THAT THE ONLY BUREAUCRACY IN WASHINGTON THAT IS EVEN MORE INTRACTABLE THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS VETERANS AFFAIRS. YOU CAN HAVE, I THINK, A VERY EFFECTIVE SECRETARY LIKE GENERAL SHINSEKI WHO IS THE SECRETARY NOW AND HAS BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE ADMINISTRATION WHO IS ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO GETTING THINGS RIGHT, BUT GETTING IT DOWN THROUGH THAT BUREAUCRACY AND GETTING PEOPLE WILLING TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS IS VERY DIFFICULT. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT TO IT. AND IT BRINGS US BACK TO ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE CULPRITS AND THAT'S THE CONGRESS. THE CONGRESS HAS MICROMANAGED VETERANS AFFAIRS IN SUCH A WAY THAT CHANGING ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH DEALING WITH VETERANS REQUIRES LITERALLY AN ACT OF CONGRESS. SO WE WOULD TRY PILOT PROGRAMS WHERE WE WOULD EXPEDITE DISABILITY EVALUATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM DONE IN 100 OR 150 DAYS RATHER THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS OR MORE, BUT WE COULDN'T EXPAND THAT ONCE WE SHOWED IT WOULD WORK WITHOUT A CHANGE IN THE LAW. AND THAT PROVED ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE.
Jon: SO YOU WERE PRESIDING THERE --
THIS IS AN INTERESTING CASE IN WASHINGTON. IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT FOR A LACK OF MONEY.
Jon: AND NOT FOR A LACK OF MONEY OR DESIRE. THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE V.A. I MET A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO HELP THE VETERANS. THEY ARE AS TRAPPED IN THIS BYZANTINE SYSTEM AS ANYBODY  OTHER THAN THOSE THOSE WAITING. BUT YOU TALK ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK THE REVELATIONS --WALTER REED HOSPITAL, WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE CONDITIONS THAT THE VETERANS WERE LIVING IN  WERE SUBSTANDARD. YOU JUMPED IN THERE. THERE WAS TWO COMMITTEES THAT IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK THERE. YOU CHANGED THE CULTURE ALMOST ON A DIME. THINGS CHANGED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. WHY CAN'T WE DO A SURGE LIKE THAT FOR THE PAPERWORK BACKLOGS TO GET THESE GUYS THEIR BENEFITS? IT'S HARD TO FATHOM.
ONE OF THE REASONS THINGS CHANGED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WAS BECAUSE I FIRED THE COMMANDER OF THE HOSPITAL, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF THE ARMY AND THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT GOT PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. PART OF THE PROBLEM IN WASHINGTON IS THE UNWILLINGNESS TO HOLD INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERFORMANCE. I TRIED TO DO THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I NOTICE IN THE HEADLINES IN THE LAST DAY OR SO THAT THERE'S MORE TROUBLE WITH THE AIR FORCE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. I FIRED BOTH THE AIR FORCE CHIEF OF STAFF AND THE AIR FORCE SECRETARY FOR THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO TACKLE PROBLEMS IN THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. SO YOU HAVE TO -- WHETHER IT'S VETERAN AFFAIRS OR ANY PLACE ELSE. IT'S NOT JUST AT THE TOP. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOW THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE.
Jon: YES. I AGREE. CAN YOU STICK AROUND A LITTLE BIT? IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. ROBERT GATES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK ON THE WEB.
