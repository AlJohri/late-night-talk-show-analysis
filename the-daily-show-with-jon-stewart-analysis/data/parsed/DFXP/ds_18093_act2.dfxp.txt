Jon:  WHAT DO YOU CALL IT  THERE, TERRORISM-- EVERYBODY GOT  QUIET REAL FAST. IT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS A LOT  LATELY WITH THE TERRIBLE,  TERRIBLE BOSTON BOMBINGS AND THEIR AFTERMATH BUT THERE HAS  BEEN ANOTHER THREAT UNFOLDING.
LETTERS SENT TO BOTH  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE UNITED  STATES SENATOR TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE DEADLY POISON RICIN.
Jon:  I AM SHOCKED THAT  PEOPLE STILL MAIL LETTERS. ( LAUGHTER )  I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL ABOUT CYBER  TERRORISM NOW. FOR THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE RICIN INVESTIGATION CAN BE  SUMMED UP WITH WHAT IS POSSIBLY�� MY FAVORITE SENTENCE EVER A TTERED IN RELATION TO�U POSSIBLE DEADLY TERRORIST  INCIDENT.
THEY'VE SWITCHED THEIR FOCUS  FROM AN ELVIS IMPERSONATOR TO A  KARATE INSTRUCTOR. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  YOU KNOW, IN  TODAY'S FAST-PACED WORLD, WE  NEVER REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO TRULY SAFE ORT LITTLE THING SO  I'M GOING TO PLAY THAT AGAIN.
AUTHORITIES HAVE SWITCHED  THEIR FOCUS FROM THE ELVIS  IMPERSONATOR, TO A CRAWT  INSTRUCTOR. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  THAT ANSWER TO THE  MOST ( BLEEP ) GAME OF "CLUE"  EVER. THE KARATE INSTRUCTOR DID IT  WITH THE RICE INCONSISTENT  BREAKFAST NOOK. BY THE WAY, THAT ELVIS  IMPERSONATOR. DO NOT PIGEONHOLE HIM, MEDIA. HE DOES A MEAN RANDY TRAVIS   ♪ ON THE OTHER HAND  THERE'S A GOLDEN MAN   ♪ AND IT REMINDS ME OF SOMEONE  ♪ ♪  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  THAT'S HIS LAWYER,  AND IF YOU LIKE THAT BE SURE TO  LOOK FOR HIS NEW ALBUM "CLEARED RICIN SUSPECT."  THAT IS PAUL KEVIN CURTIS. I WANT TO REITERATE THIS, HE'S  BEEN COMPLETELY CLEARED IN THIS  INVESTIGATION. IT TURNS OUT THE ELVIS  IMPERSONATOR MAY HAVE BEEN  FRAMED FOR THE CRIME OF SENDING DEADLY POISON TO THE PRESIDENT  BY J. EVERETT DUTSCHKE, ANGRY  THAT HE WAS REMOVING HIS CAMPAIGN BUMPER STICKERS. THIS IS NOT A CUNNING TERROR  PLOT. IT'S DAVID LYNCH TRECT AN  EPISODE OF "MAMMA'S FAMILY."  ( LAUGHTER )  BUT I GOTTA GIVE CURTIS HIS DUE. I HAVE SELDOM SEEN ANYONE MAKE A  MORE ENTERTAINING USE OF HIS 15  MINUTES.
LET IT, KNOWN, IF YOU NEED  THE MEGAREPRESENTATION, THIS IS  THE PERSON.
RIGHT NOW MY-- I CAN'T REALLY  AFFORD TO PAY HER THE MILLION  THAT SHE'S WORTH.
OH WHATEVER!
BUT I AM A LICENSED CERTIFIED  REFLEXOLOGIST, AND I'M GOING TO  START WITH FOOT MASSAGE THERAPY WITH CHRISTIE, WHO IS GOING TO  BE MY FIRST CLIENT AND I'M GOING  TO DONATE 100,000 HOURS TO COMMUNITY SERVICE IN NORTHEAST  MISSISSIPPI TO ALL YOU LADIES  WHO NEED FOOT MASSAGE THERAPY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  HE SEEMS LIKE A  GOOD GUY. THE ONLY THING -- AT LEAST HE'S  GOT A SENSE OF HUMOR. I WONDER HOW YOU GO THROUGH AN  ORDEAL LIKE THAT AND KEEP SUCH  HIGH SPIRITS.
I'VE BEEN TO JAIL 20 TIMES  AND I'VE NEVER BEEN CONVICT OF  ANYTHING SO FAR.
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT THEY  SAY, IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T
