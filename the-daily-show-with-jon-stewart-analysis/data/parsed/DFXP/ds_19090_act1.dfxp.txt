FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD MORNING. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW FILM "DRAFT DAY" JENNIFER GARNER IS JOINING US. BUT BEFORE WE START AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A WILD DAY AROUND HERE. YOU MAY REMEMBER A FEW YEARS BACK THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN ON THIS PROGRAM BY THE NAME OF STEPHEN COLBERT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE WAS -- YEA HIGH, SKIN LIKE PORCELAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] VERY TALENTED ACTOR, WRITER, DANCER, IMPROVISATIONAL COMEDIAN. WE WOULD OCCASIONALLY SEND HIM OUT INTO THE FIELD, USUALLY WITH SOME TYPE OF FRUIT AND WE WOULD SEE WHERE THE DAY TOOK US.
THERE'S AN ALLEGATION THAT THE PRINCE HAD A GAY EXPERIENCE.
YOUR WORDS, NOT MINE, JON. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH, IF IT WAS SUBSTANTIATED. [LAUGHTER] NOT GAY, JON, ARISTOCRATIC, IT'S A DIFFERENT CULTURE THAN OURS.
Jon: WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT IT? [LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] MAINLY HOW GAY IT IS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OKAY. SO -- [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY WE SPENT ALL DAY LOOKING UP OLD STUFF ON THE INTERNET OF STEPHEN. IT'S REALLY FUN. I MEAN WORKING, WE WERE WORKING. TRULY ONE OF GREAT PLEASURES OF DOING THIS WILL SHOW HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAINTAIN PROFESSIONAL COMPOSURE WHILST MR. COLBERT IS MAKING ME LAUGH UNCONTROLIBLY. THE EXCITING NEWS TODAY IS I NO LONGER NEED A CABLE SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING STEPHEN COLBERT. OUR GOOD FRIEND STEPHEN COLBERT WILL BE HEADING TO CBS TO TAKE OVER THE LATE SHOW FROM, FOR AT LEAST ME, THE COMEDIAN BROADCASTER WHO IS THE BEST THERE EVER WAS, DAVID LETTERMAN. I THINK THE BEST THERE EVER WAS. AND I THINK -- HERE IS THE EXCITING THING FOR ME. I THINK STEPHEN COLBERT IS UP FOR THE CHALLENGE. WHILE WE WISH DAVE THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR A WELL EARNED RETIREMENT, THERE'S NO GREATER JOY THAN SEEING A GENUINELY GOOD MAN WHO WORKS AS HARD AS HE CAN EVERY DAY AND DESERVES ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WORLD ACTUALLY GET THAT SUCCESS. FOR STEPHEN WE'RE JUST THRILLED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WILL BE, HERE IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN BROADWAY AND LOOK UP AT THE ED SULLIVAN THEATER MARQUEE AND SEE THE "LATE SHOW" WITH STEPHEN COLBERT, ASSUMING THAT IS WHERE THEY TAPE IT. THERE IS ALSO, YOU KNOW, A THEATER ACROSS THE STREET FROM US HERE WHICH I BELIEVE IS CURRENTLY REFERRED TO AS THE HUSTLER CLUB. BOTH VENUES PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THE PRESENCE OF ED SULLIVAN. MY POINT IS THIS -- [LAUGHTER] GODSPEED TO BOTH MEN. TURNING TO THE WORLD OF SPORT -- BAD SEGUE. THIS WEEK SAW MARCH MADNESS DRAW TO A CLOSE WITH CHAMPIONSHIP WINS FOR BOTH THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT MEN'S AND WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS. WOOF -- THEY ARE THE HUSKIES. LET'S GO RIGHT OUT TO HEAR FROM THE MOST OUTSTANDING PLAYER OF FINAL FOUR, SHABAZZ NAPIER.
WE DO HAVE HUNGRY NIGHTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET FOOD. THERE ARE HUNGRY NIGHTS WHERE I'M NOT ABLE TO EAT AND I STILL HAVE TO PLAY UP TO MY CAPABILITIES. THERE ARE HUNGRY NIGHTS THAT I GO TO BED AND I'M STARVING.
Jon: I'M SORRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND SURELY YOUR WEALTHY PARENTS AND OR LOCAL BASKETBALL PATRONS CAN SEND YOU A LOT OF MONEY SO YOU CAN ORDER FOOD. HOW COULD A GUY PLAYING ON THE BIGGEST STAGE IN COLLEGE SPORTS BE GOING HUNGRY.
IF YOU COME FROM A LOW INCOME URBAN ENVIRONMENT THERE'S NO MOM SEND ME A MEAL CARD. SEND ME MONEY. I RAN OUT OF CASH. THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THESE GUYS END UP GOING TO BED HUNGRY.
Jon: SOME OF THE PLAYERS INTEGRAL TO THE NCAA TOURNAMENT DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO EAT. BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY TO BE INVOLVED IN A STRUGGLING START-UP CHARITY TOURNAMENT LIKE MARCH MADNESS.
THE NCAA SIGNING THIS LANDMARK 14 YEAR DEAL WITH TURNER BROADCASTING AND CBS SPORTS. GET THIS. $10.8 BILLION AGREEMENT.
ESTIMATES SUGGEST THE COLLEGE SPORTS INDUSTRY GENERATES ON AVERAGE $11 BILLION IN REVENUE ANNUALLY.
Jon: OKAY, BUT WAIT, THAT IS PRETAX. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS PRETAX. THAT IS GROSS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GROSS. IT'S -- IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, WAIT A MINUTE, I FORGOT, ACTUALLY IT'S $11 BILLION BECAUSE ANYWAY THEY ARE A NONPROFIT. THE NCAA IS A NONPROFIT. SO $11 BILLION IN I GUESS NOTHING BUT NET WOULD BE THE PHRASE. [LAUGHTER] IT SOUNDS LIKE GOING UP AGAINST A NONPROFIT MONOPOLY LIKE THE NCAA WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ATHLETES TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITIONS. IN A GAME CHANGING DECISION A NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD FOUND FOOTBALL PLAYERS AT NORTHWESTERN NOW QUALIFY AS UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE.
Jon: UNIONS? [LAUGHTER] SINCE WHEN DO UNIONS BELONG IN COLLEGE SPORTS? THEY ARE SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST COLLECTIVES. SPORTS ARE ABOUT PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AS A GROUP WORKING TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY, PUTTING THE TEAM AHEAD OF THE -- OH, MY GOD! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD ON A SECOND. I KNEW THAT PICTURE OF STALIN LOOKED FAMILIAR. HOW DID THE NCAA REACT TO THIS DECISION?
THE NCAA SAYS IT'S DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RULING ADDING STUDENTS PLAY FOR THE LOVE OF SPORT NOT FOR A SALARY.
Jon: YES, THE LOVE OF SPORT MUCH LIKE THE NCAA BROADCASTS MARCH MADNESS FOR THE LOVE OF THE SPORT. NOT FOR A $10.8 BILLION CONTRACT WHICH THEY ALSO LOVE. THE HEAD OF NCAA MARK EMMERT WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THESE AT-TIME HUNGRY INDIVIDUALS WHAT THEY ARE REALLY BEING PAID WITH IS THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFT OF ALL.
THE GAME CHANGER FOR A YOUNG PERSON IN LIFE IS THAT THEY GET AN EDUCATION. THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY LEARNED AS A STUDENT ATHLETE AND WHAT THEY GAINED IN THE CLASSROOM.
Jon: THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHT AND WHILE MANY BIG-TIME COLLEGE SPORTS SCHOOLS HAVE MADE A MOCKERY OF ACADEMIC STANDARDS FOR ATHLETES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS CREATING NO SHOW CLASSES, PREDETERMINED MAJORS AND GRADES TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION OF ACADEMIC COMPLIANCE. POINT TAKEN. STUDENT -- STUDENT STILL COMES BEFORE ATHLETE.
PLAYERS SPEND 50-60 HOURS A WEEK ENGAGING IN FOOTBALL RELATED ACTIVITIES.
Jon: ALL THAT MEANS IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO MANAGE YOUR TIME MORE CAREFULLY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE IF THESE ATHLETES WHO HAVE JUST DIRECTLY POURED MILLIONS INTO THE COFFERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT ARE HUNGRY, THEY COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO ARE GIVING AWAY EVERYTHING FROM DRINKS TO FROYO TO THE CRAZIEST OF BREADS TO REWARD UCONN'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. IF OF COURSE THAT WAS IN ANY WAY LEGAL UNDER NCAA RULES GOVERNING THE ACCEPTANCE BY ATHLETES OF ANYTHING OF MONETARY OR CALORIC VALUE.
OKLAHOMA SELF REPORTING THREE STUDENTS RECEIVED FOOD IN EXCESS OF NCAA REGULATIONS AT A GRADUATION BANQUET. THEY WERE PROVIDED PASTA IN EXCESS OF THE PERMISSIBLE AMOUNT.
Jon: IF I MAY HERE IS A DRAMATIC REENACTMENT OF THE NCAA ENFORCING THAT REGULATION. HEY, HEY, (bleep). YEAH, HALF A CUP OF PENNE, (bleep), HALF A CUP. I DON'T CARE IF YOU CAN DUNK WITH BOTH HANDS, HALF A CUP OF PENNE. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS WRONG WITH PLAYERS BANDING TOGETHER TO NEGOTIATE THEMSELVES A FAIR SITUATION? ONCE AGAIN THE PRESIDENT OF THE NCAA?
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK THE NOTION OF USING A UNION EMPLOYEE MODEL TO SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MOST PEOPLE AS A GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS. IT WOULD BLOW UP EVERYTHING ABOUT THE COLLEGIATE MODEL OF ATHLETICS.
Jon: AND WE LIKE OUR EXPLOITATIVE, OVERWHELMINGLY FINANCIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO US DRACONIAN COLLEGIATE MODEL. I MEAN, YOU KNOW THE OLD EXPRESSION, IF THEY ARE BROKE, WHY FIX IT?  SO, THAT'S HOW THE NCAA FEELS. BUT THAT'S JUST AN ORGANIZATION. I'M SURE THE COACHES, THE GUYS WHO SPEND EVERY DAY WITH THESE KIDS. I BET THE COACHES ARE ON THEIR SIDE.
I'M A FOOTBALL COACH, I'M A TEACHER, I'M AN EDUCATOR. THIS ISN'T WHAT I SIGNED UP TO BE. I SIGNED UP TO HELP THESE GUYS TO DEVELOP TO BE THE BEST THEY CAN BE NOT TO BE AN EMPLOYER.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO GET TECHNICAL OF COURSE YOU ARE NOT THE EMPLOYER, YOU'RE KIND OF THE SUPERVISOR, THE FLOOR MANAGER. THE FLOOR BEING 100 YARDS LONG AND YOU CAN AT YOUR WHIM GET THEM TO RUN BACK AND FORTH ON UNTIL THEY VOMIT OR MORE SPECIFICALLY DRY HEAVE SEEING AS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FOOD IN THE BELLY. BUT LISTEN, YOU ARE AN EDUCATOR, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT WITH ONE SMALL SOMEWHAT CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE.
HEAD COACHES AT 44 SCHOOLS IN THE NCAA'S FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP BOWL GAMES MAKE AN AVERAGE OF $2 MILLION IN SALARIES AND IN 40 OF THE 50 STATES PUBLIC UNIVERSITY HEAD FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL COACHES ARE THE HIGHEST PAID PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.
Jon: EXCUSE ME THEY PREFER THE TERM EDUCATOR. BUT ALL RIGHT, SO AS WE DO AT THE END OF EVERY MARCH MADNESS A SALUTE TO THE HEROES, TO THE EDUCATORS OF THESE FINE STUDENT ATHLETES. ♪ ONE SHINING MOMENT YOU REACH FOR THE SKY ♪ ♪ ONE SHINING MOMENT, YOU KNEW, ONE SHINING MOMENT YOU WERE WILLING TO TRY ♪ ♪ ONE SHINING MOMENT YOU KNEW.
Jon: YEAH, IT GETS ME EVERY TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
