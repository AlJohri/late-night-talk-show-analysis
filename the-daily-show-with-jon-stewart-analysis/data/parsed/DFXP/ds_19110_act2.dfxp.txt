Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! LAST WEEK, WHAT'S HIS NAME, THERE -- LAST WEEK, INDIA ELECTED A NEW PRIME MINISTER, NARENDRA MODI. TONIGHT, JASON JONES FILES HIS FINAL REPORT FROM INDIA, EXAMINING THIS NEW LEADER. ♪♪
IN A CRUSHING DEFEAT TO ITS INCUMBENT PARTY, INDIA HAS CHOSEN A NEW LEADER, BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION THE AMERICAN MEDIA HAS ABOUT THE NEW PRIME MINISTER, NARENDRA MODI.
WHAT IF ANYTHING DOES THE U.S. HAVE TO FEAR FROM THIS MAN?
HE'S CONSERVATIVE, HE'S A HINDU NATIONALIST.
HE HAS AN UGLY PAST.
SOME PEOPLE VIEW HIM AS MAYBE BEING IN THE AUTHORITARIAN MODE.
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE AN ENEMY OF THIS MAN.
ACCORDING TO US, INDIA HAS JUST ELECTED THIS GUY -- (SCREAMING) BUT EVEN INDIAN JOURNALISTS STILL HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK NARENDRA MODI WHY HASN'T HE HELD HIMSELF TRULY ACCOUNTABLE. I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT IF 1,000 PEOPLE DIE UNDER YOUR WATCH WHEN YOU'RE CHIEF MINISTER EITHER YOU'RE INCOMPETENT, YOU'RE COMPLICIT OR BOTH.
WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO WAS THIS.
IT WAS DURING HIS TENURE THAT AT LEAST A THOUSAND TEAM MOSTLY MUSLIMS WERE KILLED DURING THE RELIGIOUS RIOTS IN 2002.
AND MODI REFUSES TO ADDRESS THIS CONTROVERSY. BUT LET'S REMEMBER, I'M THE GUY WHO WENT TO RUSSIA AND GOT GORBACHEV'S NUMBER ON THE BLACK MARKET, SO THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS GOING ALL THE WAY TO INDIA AND NOT GETTING AN INTERVIEW WITH MODI. OH, IS, IS THAT, IS THAT HIM? THAT'S MODI? HEY, AFTER ALL THAT IS SAID AND DONE, MR. MODI, AFTER THE 2002 2002 GUJRAT RIOTS DO YOU EXPRESS ANY, ANY REMORSE WHATSOEVER?
HE'S SEEMS TO BE  MODI.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SEEMS TO BE MODI?
HE SEEMS TO BE MODI. HE LIKE MODI. HE'S NOT MODI.
THIS IS A MODI LOOKALIKE?
LOOK LIKE MODI, YEAH.
AH (BLEEP). OF COURSE MODI WASN'T GOING TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC, HE WAS THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN INDIA. BUT THEN I SAW A REPORT ON INDIAN TELEVISION THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY HOLDING A RALLY ACROSS TOWN. IT'S MODI. MR. MODI, MR. MODI. YOU'VE YET TO EXPRESS ANY REMORSE. WHY IS THAT?
I NEED A TRANSLATOR! I NEED A TRANSLATOR! OKAY. HOLD ON. YOU'RE NOT THE REAL MODI? LISTEN, I'M NOT SAYING YOU ALL LOOK ALIKE, BUT YOU REALLY LOOK ALIKE.
I LOOK LIKE MODI? YEAH. TURNS OUT IN A COUNTRY AS BIG AS THIS, A CANDIDATE CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE, SO INSTEAD THEY DISPATCH LOOKALIKES TO RALLY THE VOTERS. AND WHEN I WAS IN VARANASI I SAW MODI DOUBLES, TRIPLES AND EVEN QUADRUPLES.
HE'S SAME AS LOOKING MODI HAS.
NO, HE DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE HIM. THIS GUY'S THE WORST YET. MODI HAD GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO DODGE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 2002 RIOTS, BUT ACCORDING TO THIS BJP SPOKESMAN, THAT CASE IS CLOSED.
IT'S ONLY A FEW ELITE PEOPLE SITTING IN THE MEDIA WHO CAN'T REALLY FORGET THE MEMORIES OF 2002.
SO WHY HASN'T HE COME OUT AND JUST SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED?
THE SUPREME COURT CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE INQUIRIES AND HE HAS PRACTICALLY GOT A CLEAN SHEET.
JUST FOR THE RECORD, YOU SAID CLEAN -- ?
CLEAN SHEET.
WHAT WAS IT?
CLEAN SHEET.
THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND HAD CLEARED NARENDRA MODI AND THE PEOPLE HAD ACCEPTED THAT DECISION. WHAT ABOUT THE CRITICISM OF MODI SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T, HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE MUSLIMS.
THE SUPREME COURT GAVE HIM A CLEAN SHEET.
I THINK I'M LOSING SOMETHING IN THE TRANSLATION. CAN WE PUT UP A SUBTITLE? THE COURTS HAVE GIVEN HIM A CLEAN CHIT.
CHIT. CHIT. CHIT. OH, CHIT MEANS LEGAL RECORD. OK, WELL I PROMISED MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO COME TO THIS VIBRANT DEMOCRACY AND MAKE CHEAP CHIT JOKES, BUT SINCE BUT, YOU KNOW, SINCE THEY STARTED IT.
THE HONORABLE COURT OF INDIA HAS GIVEN HIM A CLEAN CHIT, SO NO QUESTIONS.
THERE IS ONE QUESTION. CAN YOU EVER REALLY HAVE A CLEAN CHIT?
100%, ABSOLUTELY. HIS CLEAN CHIT.
MUSLIMS ARE SAYING HIS CHIT IS STILL DIRTY.
SEE, I AM TOO SMALL A PERSON TO, YOU KNOW, GIVE A COMMAND.
SO, IFTHE COURT SAYS CLEAN CHIT.
IT'S A CLEAN CHIT.
MODI HAS A CLEAN CHIT, CLEAN CHIT, CLEAN CHIT.
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY USE A DIFFERENT WORD.
I THINK I SAID CLEAN CHIT.
IT SOUNDS DIFFERENT TO OUR EARS.
OH! (BLEEP)?
YEAH.
OK, BUT THESE ARE ALL HINDUS. WHAT DO THE MUSLIMS HAVE TO SAY?
CLEAN CHIT.
CLEAN CHIT?
CLEAN CHIT.
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. HOW WAS IT THAT EVEN MODI'S STARKEST OPPONENT SEEMED TO ACCEPT HIS DEMOCRATIC VICTORY?
WE MUST LEARN AND MUST HAVE THE COURAGE TO HONOR THE DECISION OF OUR OWN PEOPLE.
WOW! BUT I'M FROM AMERICA WHERE WE STOP PEOPLE FROM VOTING, WHERE WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN NOT GETTING ANYTHING DONE. WE'VE BECOME OBSTRUCTIONISTS FOR ON INSTRUCTION'S SAKE. WAS THERE ANYTHING I COULD DO TO FEEL THE INNER POLITICAL PEACE I FELT AMONG THESE HOPEFUL INDIANS?
YOU GO TO THE GANGES. HAVE A DIP. THE WATER HAS THAT KIND OF POWER.
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ♪♪
AS I JOURNEYED TOWARD THE FETED HOLY WATERS OF MOTHER GANGA-JI, MY ENTIRE INDIAN EXPERIENCE BEGAN TO MAKE SENSE. INDIA TAUGHT ME TO OPEN MYSELF TO NEW CUISINES WHAT'S SO FUNNY? (SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. NEW STUPID GAMES AND A NEW WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT. AND I REALIZED AFTER A DECISIVE ELECTION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, EVERYONE SHOULD JUST SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP AND MOVE ON. BUT, AS I PREPARED TO STEP INTO THIS HOLY DUMPING GROUND FOR RAW SEWAGE AND DEAD BODIES, I REMEMBERED THE IMPORTANT LESSON I'D LEARNED. SO WHEN MODI DOESN'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING, YOU SEND IN THIS GUY
YES.
WELL, DON'T TURN AROUND, IT RUINS THE ILLUSION. AND YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY IN OR ELSE IT DOESN'T COUNT. YEAH. THAT'S A GOOD CLEANSE. (APPLAUSE) I FEEL A LOT BETTER.
Jon: JASON JONES, AND PRODUCER BRENNAN SHROFF. EXCELLENT WORK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
