[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ACADEMY AWARD WINNER WHOSE NEW FILM IS CALLED "JERSEY BOYS."
A VOICE LIKE YOURS IS GIFT FROM GOD. THE WORLD IS GOING TO HEAR THAT VOICE, YOU UNDERSTAND.
SURE, MR. DeCARLO. IT'S JUST...
WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST WISH THINGS WOULD START TO HAPPEN.
IMPATIENT, HUH? DON'T WORRY. YOU WORK HARD, EVERYTHING FOLLOWS. AM I RIGHT, TOMMY?
BIGGER THAN SINATRA, GYP, MY HAND TO GOD.
Jon: DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT THAT WAY, BUT ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM CHRISTOPHER WALKEN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NICE. NICE. WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND. HOW ARE YOU?
THANK YOU, GOOD.
Jon: HOW IS YOUR SUMMER? NICE SO FAR? AND SPRING?
YEAH. SO FAR.
NICE?
WELL, IT'S STILL COLD.
Jon: IT HAS BEEN COLD THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.
YEAH, YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING AND IT'S NOT SUMMER YET.
Jon: IT IS NOT SUMMER YET. [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS CHRISTOPHER WALKEN'S PERFECT TEMPERATURE? WHAT WOULD BE... IF YOU COULD CLIMATE CONTROL, WHERE WOULD YOU FIND YOURSELF TEMPERATURE WISE. GIVE ME A RANGE.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC.
THIS TIME OF YEAR, KIND OF BALMY.
Jon: YOU'D LIKE A BALMY TEMPERATURE.
BALMY TEMPERATURE.
Jon: WOULD YOU LIKE A HUMIDITY? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE IN A HUMIDITY?
NO, NO, NOT TOO MUCH.
Jon: YOU LIKE IT DRY.
DRY AND BALMY.
Jon: NOW FOR THIS PART OF THE WORLD, THIS REGION, DRY AND BALMY, WE GET THAT FOR LIKE A DAY. THEN IT GOES INTO LIKE SUBWAY KIND OF CLOSE, YOU KNOW THAT HUMID FEELING.
BUT WHERE I LIVE, THERE'S TIME WHERE YOU CAN'T TELL IF IT'S THE BEGINNING OF WINTER OR THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER.
Jon: WHERE YOU LIVE?
YEAH.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU, ONE OF THE POLES? WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
I LIVE IN CONNECTICUT. BUT IT'S NOT... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CLIMATE OF CONNECTICUT BEING THAT...
WELL, IT'S THAT KIND OF IN BETWEEN THING, YOU KNOW? IT'S JUST STARTING TO GET COLD OR IT'S JUST STARTING TO GET WARM. IT'S KIND OF...
Jon: YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
NO, IT'S A CERTAIN PLACE.
Jon: IT'S A PLACE. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, ARE YOU IN A RURAL SITUATION OR ARE WE IN MORE OF... YOU'RE IN A RURAL SITUATION.
KIND OF WOODS.
Jon: SEE, I DON'T SEE THAT FOR YOU. I DON'T SEE THAT FOR YOU. I SEE YOU AS A CITY CAT, A GUY THAT LIKES THE ACTION, THAT LIKES THE INTENSITY, THAT LIKES THE ENERGY.
NO, I HAVE A GROUNDHOG. I HAVE...  [LAUGHTER] I HAVE HUMMINGBIRDS.
Jon: I DON'T PICTURE THAT.
I HAVE A HUGE RACCOON. I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF SHORT-HAIRED. THEY LOOK LIKE SMALL KANGAROOS. VERY STRANGE.
Jon: THAT IS STRANGE. DO YOU LIVE BY A NUCLEAR FACILITY? [LAUGHTER] WHEN DO YOU SEE THE RACCOONS, AND DOES THAT MAKE YOU... NOW, I'VE BEEN MORE OF A CITY PERSON, SO I WOULD GET I THINK VERY NERVOUS IF A GIANT RACCOON ATTACKED MY PROPERTY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY COME IN THE HOUSE.
Jon: OK SEE, THAT I WOULDN'T...
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO SHUT THE CAT DOOR BECAUSE... [LAUGHTER] THEY COME IN. THEY EAT EVERYTHING.
Jon: CAN'T YOU JUST GET THE CAT TO DO THAT? YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING? DO YOUR CATS, ARE THEY OUTDOOR?
OH, YEAH.
Jon: ARE THEY, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THIS, ARE THEY VICIOUS KILLERS OUTSIDE?
NO, THEY DO NATURAL CAT THINGS, YOU KNOW, BUT... [LAUGHTER] IT'S STRICTLY BUSINESS.
Jon: YOU EVER GO OUT AND SEE THE CAT AND RACCOON ARE HAVING A LITTLE CONVERSATION OVER IN THE CORNER AND YOU THINK, "I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?"
NO BUT I SAW A SKUNK, A SKUNK AND A, WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE THINGS WITH THE...
Jon: GORILLA.
I SAW THEM TANGLING.
Jon: A SKUNK HAVING A FIGHT?
WITH A... NOT AN OTTER, SOMETHING ELSE.
Jon: DO YOU LIVE IN A ZOO? WHAT'S GOING ON. SO YOU SAW A SKUNK? WERE THEY PHYSICALLY FIGHTING?
YEAH, THEY WERE ROLLING AROUND ON THE GROUND.
Jon: SEE, IF I'M A SKUNK, THAT BURIES THE LEAD, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE MY BIG CLOSER IS BOOM.
NO, ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: I SPRAY. THE IDEA THAT I'M GOING TO GET IN A GRAPPLE WITH ANOTHER ANIMAL MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.
MAYBE YOU KNOW IT JUST DOESN'T PULL THE TRIGGER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING IN FLORIDA A SKUNK IS GOING TO STAND HIS GROUND, HE'S GOING TO PULL THE TRIGGER, BUT IN CONNECTICUT, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO... THEY DON'T WANT TO GET, NO LETHAL
BUT IN THIS CASE, YOU'RE TANGLING WITH AN ALLIGATOR.
Jon: THAT IS A GOOD POINT. BUT, THIS IS VERY INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE COMPLETELY MISAPPREHENDED WHERE I THOUGHT YOU LIVED. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE. [LAUGHTER] I'M SORRY. THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING STORY TO ME. FOUR SEASONS, YOU PLAY THE MOBSTER THAT KIND OF LOOKS OUT FOR THEM.
THEIR MENTOR.
Jon: THEIR MENTOR, AND HELPS THEM OUT. BUT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE. THESE ARE KIDS, THEY'RE LIKE SONG AND DANCE KIDS FROM A VERY TOUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. YOU GREW UP IN QUEENS. YOU WERE A THEATER KID. DID PEOPLE HASSLE YOU TOO, IS IT LIKE, FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THEATER AND THAT KIND OF THING?
UH, NO.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT, YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
WHERE I COME FROM IN QUEENS, AT THAT TIME ANYWAY, A LOT OF THE POLICEMEN CAME FROM QUEENS, AND IT WAS JUST TYPICAL TO SEND YOUR KIDS TO TAP SCHOOL ON SATURDAY. SO THERE'S ALL THESE RETIRED COPS ALL OVER HERE, MY AGE, WHO CAN TAP DANCE.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. CHRISTOPHER...
VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT.
Jon: CHRISTOPHER, IF IT'S THE LAST THING WE DO, WE GOT TO PUT ON A SHOW. HERE'S MY PLAN... [APPLAUSE] I THINK THIS IS THE PERFECT THING. 200 RETIRED COPS, TAP LINE. RIGHT IN FRONT OF THAT, SKUNK WRESTLING AN OTTER. BOOM! WE SELL OUT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL. "JERSEY BOYS" IS IN THEATERS JUNE 20th. IT'S THE GREAT CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.
