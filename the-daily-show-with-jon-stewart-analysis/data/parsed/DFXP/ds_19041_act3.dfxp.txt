Jon: THAT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE. IT'S JUST 120 MINUTES. [LAUGHTER] PLEASE WELCOME OSCAR ISAAC. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, MAN. GOOD.
Jon: I GOTTA TELL YOU, MAN. THIS -- YOU SEE CERTAIN MOMENTS IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S CAREER WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DISCOVER THAT PERSON, AND THAT -- I FEEL LIKE THIS ROLE FOR YOU -- MAN, YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY GOOD IN THIS.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jon: THE SINGING THAT IS YOUR VOICE. AND YOUR GUITAR PLAYING.
AND THAT ACTING ALSO YOU.
ALL OF IT WAS LIVE. T BONE BURNETT PRODUCED THE MUSIC. HE'S REVOLUTIONARY. WE WORKED HARD ON THE MUSIC BEFORE HAND.
Jon: THAT IS A LOT OF TALENT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS ALSO MY SIZE. I FEEL LIKE A MAN OF YOUR TALENT SHOULD BE EASILY SIX FIVE.
YOU WOULD THINK THAT BUT THE SLIGHT MAN HAS AN ADVANTAGE AT TIMES. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST THING YOU SAID TO ME WHEN WE FIRST MET. I THOUGHT SOMEONE THAT GOOD WOULD WE TALLER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M A SMOOTH TALKER. [ LAUGHTER ] THE FILM THOUGH IS SO RICH IN DETAIL AND TALENT AND EFFORT. IS THIS THE COEN BROTHERS IS IT JUST THEIR ABILITY TO THINK OF EVERYTHING.
YEAH, THEY DO AND ALSO THEIR INSTINCT. I THINK THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM GENIUSES. NOT THAT THEY THINK IT UP BEFORE HAND AND PUT IT IN IT'S THAT THEIR INSTINCTS TAKE THEM TO THE CHOICE THAT HAS THE MOST HISTORY IN IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
EVERYTHING THEY COME UP WITH THEY ARE REALLY SMART. YOU CAN HOLD IT UP AND EVERY TIME YOU LOOK AT IT SOMETHING NEW POPS UP.
Jon: IT'S INCREDIBLE. WHICH CAME FIRST THE MUSIC? WERE YOU DOING MUSIC AS A YOUNGER MAN. WERE YOU AN ACTOR WHO HAPPENED TO DABBLE?
IT WAS AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRST THING I EVER DID WAS A MUSICAL IN FIFTH GRADE THAT I WROTE.
Jon: YOU WROTE IT? YOU WERE IN FIFTH GRADE. WAS IT COOTIE LAND? WHAT WAS THE MUSICAL?
IT WAS ABOUT A PLATYPUS GOING ON TO NOAH'S ARC.
IT WAS ABOUT A PLATYPUS GOING ON TO NOAH'S ARC.
Jon: I WOULD SEE THAT NOW.
I THINK THERE'S MONEY IN IT.
Jon: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ADAPTING IT. WERE YOU IN BANDS?
I HAD A BUNCH OF BANDS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I WOULD MAKE MOVIES WITH MY FRIENDS.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF MUSIC?
PUNK BANDS AND HARD CORE BANDS. EVERY GENRE I WAS A MUSICAL WHORE.
Jon: WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?
SOUTH FLORIDA.
Jon: NO, DON'T. EVEN THE OTHER SOUTH FLORIDIAN STARTED TO CLAP AND WAS LIKE -- THE PENIS OF AMERICA. IT'S WHERE ALL THE CRAZY DRAINS. WHERE I GREW UP THERE WAS A PRETTY HEALTHY PUNK SCENE IN THE MID 80s.
IT WAS THE PUNK SKA THING COMING BACK UP.
Jon: THAT'S WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.
MID 90s THIRD WAVE.
Jon: I MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIRST WAVE OR ZERO WAVE. DID YOU PLAY THE CLUBS? DO THE CIRCUIT THE 930 CLUB AND THOSE PLACES?
MOSTLY JUST IN SOUTH FLORIDA. WE DIDN'T GET TOO FAR UP. IT WAS MORE OF A LOCAL BAND THING.
Jon: SO THURSDAY NIGHT WET T-SHIRT CONTEST FRIDAY NIGHT THE WORM PUNK SKA. VERY NICE. YOU STARTED TO PLAY CONCERTS FOR LLEWYN DAVIS. IS THERE MORE OF THAT TO COME? THERE WAS A GREAT ONE HERE IN? NEW YORK. ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO PLAY MORE? PUNCH BROTHERS T-BONE BURNETT ONE OF MUMFORD'S, YOU.
CRAZY. WE HAD A SHOW HERE AT TOWN HALL WITH JOAN BAEZ AND PATTI SMITH AND ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE PLAYING AND JACK WHITE. THAT IS WHAT IS AMAZING. WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF PROMOTING FOR THE MOVIES AND THEY'VE USED IT AS AN EXCUSE TO DO REALLY COOL THINGS. I'M NOT SURE IF THEY ARE PLANNING MORE.
Jon: I THINK HUNGER GAMES SHOULD ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU GO AROUND AND BE LIKE MAYBE WE'LL SHOOT ARROWS AT PEOPLE. IN A THEATER SOMEWHERE. [LAUGHTER] THE MOVIE IS PHENOMENAL BUT YOU IN PARTICULAR, I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT WHEN HE BURST ON TO THE SCENE WITH THAT THING.
THANKS. I APPRECIATE THAT.
Jon: THE KID IS GOOD. THE KID, I CALL HIM. "INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS." IT'S IN THE THEATERS NOW. WE WON'T TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CAT. THERE'S A CAT IT IN.
A COUPLE CATS.
Jon: AWW? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THIS CAT COULD BE AN (bleep).
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME. OSCAR ISAAC.
