WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE'RE HERE WITH THE SENATOR. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE  BECAUSE I'M UNCOMFORTABLE  ABOUT SOMETHING AND I THINK, I'M HOPING THAT YOU ARE  GOING TO HELP ME FEEL BETTER  ABOUT IT. YOU SAW ITS FIRST ACT.
I DID.
SO CLEARLY LESSONS HAVE  NOT BEEN LEARNED FROM THAT  BANKING SCANDAL UNLESS THE LESSON THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO  BE LEARNED IS US LEARNING  THAT BANKS CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY WANT. WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WELL, WE HAVEN'T  OBVIOUSLY DONE ENOUGH. AND WE NEED FAR MORE ACCOUNT  ABLE, FAR MORE TRANSPARENCY  AND MUCH LESS RISK. I TRAVEL AROUND MY STATE, I  CAN TELL YOU THE ECONOMY  HASN'T RECOVERED. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STILL  NEEDING LENDING. WE HAVEN'T SEEM SEEN THE  GROWTH THAT WE NEED. AND IN THE BROADER ISSUES, A  LOT OF FAMILIES ARE  STRUGGLING MORE THAN YOU  COULD EVEN KNOW. SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THINGS  LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE. YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE  LITERALLY WORKING 40 HOURS A  WEEK AND EARNING LESS THAN THE POVERTY LEVEL. AND IT'S THAT KIND OF  INJUSTICE THAT MAKES THIS  ISSUE EVEN MORE STRIKING.
OKAY. BUT HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANKS  AND POLITICSMENT BECAUSE ON THE VEN DIAGRAM OF THAT YOU  ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF  THAT. BECAUSE YOU ARE THE NUMBER  ONE RECIPIENT OF MONEY FROM  GOLDMAN AND SACKS. JPMORGAN WITH YOUR NUMBER  TWO CORPORATE DONOR OVER THE  LAST FIVE YEARS, WHAT I  DEEPLY WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO FOR THAT? WHAT IS REQUIRED OF YOU FOR  THAT MONEY? BECAUSE IT MAKES ME  UNCOMFORTABLE.
MY JOB IS TO REPRESENT  NEW YORK AND TO DO WHAT'S  RIGHT FOR PEOPLE. MY JOB IS TO BE A VOICE FOR  PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A  VOICE IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S WHY I TAKE ON ISSUES  LIKE SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE  MILITARY. THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING ON  ISSUES TO FIGHTING TO RAISE  THE MINIMUM WAGE. WE NEED MUCH MORE REGULATION  FOR THE BANKS. WE NEED FAR MORE  TRANSPARENCY AND  ACCOUNTABILITY. CONGRESS DIDN'T DO ENOUGH. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE  BANKING COMMITTEE WORKING ON  A NUMBER OF FORMS TO DO THE  NEXT LAYER OF THINGS, MAKING MORE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. MAKING SURE THERE IS MORE  DISCLOSURE. BUT A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT  WAS DONE ISN'T EVEN COMPLETE  YET. WE'RE STILL WAITING FROM THE  REGULATORS, FROM THE SEC AND  CSEC.
YOU OBJECTIVELY KNOW A  LOT MORE ABOUT THIS MAN ME. BUT IT BECOMES --
I LIKE THE FACT THAT YEAH,  I DO, YEAH, I DO.  BUT IT FEELS LIKE, THE  THING THAT CONCERNS ME IS  THE MONEY AND POLITICS. CHICKEN AND EGG. THE OPINIONS YOU HAVE ON  WALL STREET, DO YOU GET THE  MONEY BECAUSE YOU ALREADY  HAVE THOSE OPINIONS OR DO YOU NEED THOSE OPINIONS TO  GET THE MONEY?
WELL, I BELIEVE IN  PUBLICLY FUNDSED ELECTIONS  AND I THINK WE SHOULD GET THE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS  PERIOD. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE  DAY, REGARDLESS--   (APPLAUSE)  AT THE END OF THE DAY,  REGARDLESS OF WHO SUPPORTS YOUR CAMPAIGN, WHETHER IT  HAPPENS TO BE A LAWYER OR A  BANKER, OR STATE ATHOE HOME MOM, IT'S IRRELEVANT WHERE  THE MONEY COMES IF FROM,  WHAT MATTERS IS THE MONEY  DOESN'T TRUST POLITICIANS OR POLITICSMENT AND THEY DON'T  TRUST IT BECAUSE OF THE  LEVEL OF MONEY IN  POLITICSMENT WHAT WE HAD IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE WAS  OBSCENE. WE HAD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS  OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT ON  THESE ELECTIONS WITH LIT  REALLYLY NO DISCLOSURE. SO SOMEBODY COULD PUT IN 100  MILLION BECAUSE THEY MIGHT  SUPPORT THE OIL INDUSTRY AND THEY WANT TO ATTACK A GREEN  CANDIDATE FORBES DISCLOSURE. WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR IS  MAKING SURE THE END OF EVERY  POLITICAL AD AT A MINIMUM IT SAYS I'M JOE C.E.O. AND A  PROVE THIS MESSAGE. I'MMENT IN ONE DONOR AND I  APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE  FIGHTING FOR IS PUBLICLY  FUNDED ELECTIONS BECAUSE  THAT'S THE WAY WILL YOU CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY. AND FRANKLY, PEOPLE WILL  HAVE MORE FAITH AGAIN IN OUR  GOVERNMENT WINCE HOPE SO, CAN YOU STICK AROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT  THERE MORE. SENATOR GILLEBRAND, LADIES  AN
