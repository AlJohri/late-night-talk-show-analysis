(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  CORRESPONDENT FOR ABC NEWS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  MARTHA RADDATZ. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
THANK YOU. Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. I KNOW YOU CAME UP FROM D.C.
UP FROM D.C., YEAH. NOT TOO FAR
Jon: DID YOU BRING US ANY  GASOLINE?
A WHOLE TRUCK LOAD  Jon: ANY M.R.E.s? EVERYTHING OKAY DOWN THERE
WE WORRIED ABOUT IT BUT GOT  THROUGH IT OKAY.
Jon: WHERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE  A WHILE HERE. I WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU. YOU MODERATED THE VICE  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN JOE  BIDEN -- AND HE DIDN'T CURSE THE WHOLE TIME. AND PAUL RYAN. HE WAS VERY THIRSTY.
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU MISSED  THAT, MARTHA? BECAUSE YOU WERE MODERATING THE  DEBATE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE VERY  IMPRESSIVE IN YOUR EXERCISE OF  AUTHORITY. YOU DIDN'T LET IT... YOU DIDN'T  PRETEND THAT THE ROLE OF THE  JOURNALIST IS TO BE A LUMP OF MALLEABLE CLAY TO ABSOLVE  YOURSELF OF ANY CHARGES OF  LIBERAL BIAS OR, YOU KNOW, BEING ON THAT TEAM. IS THAT A PROBLEM WITHIN THE  JOURNALISTS' WORLD NOW?
ACTUALLY THAT'S HOW I  APPROACHED THE DEBATE. I JUST WAS DOING MY JOB. I'M A JOURNALIST. I'M NOT A HOST OF ANYTHING. I'M NOT AN ANCHOR. I'M A JOURNALIST. THAT'S WHAT I DO EVERY SINGLE  DAY. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO DO  ANYTHING DIFFERENT. I TO SAY THAT
Jon: WHERE DOES THE PRESSURE  COME FROM ON JOURNALISTS TO NOT  BE JOURNALISTS ANYMORE, FOR THE  MODERATING? THAT IDEA THAT, HAS THE PRESSURE  ON JOURNALISTS TO NOT SHOW AN  OPINION IN ANYWAY RUINED THEIR ABILITY TO CALL OUT FACTS OR  LIES?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK  EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT  APPROACH TO THIS OBVIOUSLY
Jon: SURE  I THINK YOU HAVE TO TUNE OUT  THE REST OF THE WORLD WHEN  YOU'RE STUDYING FOR THIS, WHEN YOU'RE GOING INTO IT, AND JUST  DO THE JOB YOU'VE PREPARED FOR
Jon: YOU PREPARED? I PREPARED CONSTANTLY. I DIDN'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT  MEDICARE AND MEDICAID GOING INTO  THIS. I LEARNED ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY
Jon: YOU LRNED ABOUT THE  ISSUES
I DID INDEED. RIGHT THAT DOWN
Jon: DID YOU LEARN ABOUT THE  CANDIDATES' POSITION
I LEARNED ABOUT EVERYTHING I  POSSIBLY COULD
Jon: WHEN THEY WOULD SAY  THINGS THAT WERE DECEITFUL, YOU  COULD SAY ACTUALLY IT WAS THIS THAT WE WERE ASKING ABOUT AND  BRING THEM BACK TO WHAT YOU  CONSIDERED SALIENT
AND I USE THE HAND JUST LIKE  YOU DO.
Jon: YOU DID USE THE HAND. GENTLEMEN  Jon: IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE. HAVING THEM AT THE TABLE, IS  THAT HELPFUL? BECAUSE IS THE PROBLEM JIM  LEHRER WAS SO FAR AWAY IT'S LIKE  I CAN'T EVEN SEE WHO IS THERE? IS THERE A DIFFERENT BETWEEN YOU  TWO? I'M AN OLD LEHRER
THE TABLE WAS HELPFUL. THE TABLE WAS DEFINITELY  HELPFUL. YOU LIKE THE TABLE TOO YOU CAN  DO ICON TACT. IF YOU WERE OVER THERE...
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHAT'S  BETTER THAN THE TABLE IS THE  ROLLING CHAIR
I TRIED THE ROLLING CHAIR. I DIDN'T TAKE OFF MY SHOE AND  BANG IT ON THE TABLE BUT I MIGHT  HAVE GONE THERE
Jon: IT SEEMS THAT POLITICAL  ORGANIZATIONS AND POLITICAL  PARTIES HAVE BECOME WHINY BASTIONS OF FAUX PERSECUTED  VICTIMIZED INDIVIDUALS THAT FEEL  LIKE ANYONE WHO DOESN'T AGREE WITH THEIR WORLD VIEW IS  PERSECUTING THEM. DO YOU EVER WANT TO PUNCH THEM.
HERE'S A SIMPLE ANSWER. YES.
Jon: HOW CAN YOU NOT? NOW, FOR YOU, ARE YOU GOING TO  BE COVERING... YOU OFTENTIMES  COVER VERY DANGEROUS... YOU'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN MANY MANY  TIMES. DONE ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL  REPORTING THERE AS WELL
THANK YOU  Jon: ARE YOU COVERING THE  ELECTION OR ARE YOU HEADING  OUT...
I THINK I'LL BE TOMORROW  NIGHT ON ABC NEWSY LECHES  COVERAGE. I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT  FOREIGN POLICY SO I DON'T THINK  I'LL BE SAYING MUCH UNTIL LATE, LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN  HOPEFULLY WE HAVE A WINNER. THEN IT WILL BE WHAT DIRE  SITUATIONS WILL THAT PARTICULAR  PERSON HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THAT'S WHEN THEY CALL ME IN
Jon: DEPENDING ON WHO WINS,  HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK WE  COULD KNOW IF WE'RE AT WAR WITH IRAN BY THE END OF THE NIGHT? OR DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT WAIT  TO CALL THAT?
I THINK THEY MIGHT WAIT A  COUPLE OF MONTHS. DEAL WITH A FEW OTHER THINGS  BEFORE THEY DEAL WITH IRAN BUT  IRAN WILL BE RIGHT THERE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST
Jon: HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED  WITH THE ECONOMIC SITUATION  WE'RE IN HOW FOREIGN POLICY HAS GONE ON SORT OF THE BACK BURNER? IT'S REASSERTED ITSELF A LITTLE  BIT WITH LIBYA
AND IRAN SNON THAT SEEMED TO  BE MORE OF A POLITICIZATION OF  SOMETHING. HAVE PEOPLE TALKED A LOT ABOUT  AFGHANISTAN?
I THINK IT'S HEART BREAKING  THAT PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT  AT ALL. WE'RE STILL A NATION AT WAR. YOU KNOW THIS VERY WELL. WE HAVE 68,000 TROOPS IN  AFGHANISTAN RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THIS  COUNTRY. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT. I UNDERSTAND AS A JOURNALIST  THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR I TRY TO  TELL STORIES THAT I HOPE WILL INTEREST PEOPLE. I WANT TO TELL THOSE STORIES  THAT THEY'LL CARE ABOUT. BOY, IS IT HARD. IT'S HARDER AND HARDER. I'M GOING TO GO BACK IN A COUPLE  OF WEEKS AND TRY AGAIN
Jon: I COMMEND YOU FOR DOING  THIS. NOW IT'S MORE DANGEROUS. THIS IDEA OF GREEN ON BLUE  VIOLENCE WHICH IS AFGHANI TROOPS  EMBEDDED WITH AMERICAN TROOPS TURNING ON THAT. HAS THAT BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS  CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE  MEDIA
IT DID FOR A WHILE. IT CERTAINLY CAUGHT THE  ATTENTION OF THE MEDIA. I THINK IT CAUGHT THE ATTENTION  OF THE PUBLIC BUT IT'S SOMETHING  THAT HAS FADED. I WANT TO GO AND TALK TO AS MANY  PEOPLE AS I CAN. I'VE SEEN THIS UP CLOSE. THERE ARE A LOT OF AFGHAN  SECURITY FORCES WHO ARE IN A  POSITION WHERE THEY FEEL FORCEDDED INTO SOME OF THIS. SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES  ARE THREATENED BECAUSE OTHER  PEOPLE AROUND ARE THREATENED. TALIBAN JUST GOES AFTER THEM AND  SAYS IF YOU DON'T DO THIS...
Jon: BOY, THIS IDEA THAT THEY  WERE SELLING A YEAR AGO ABOUT  THE TALIBAN MODERATING AND BECOMING A PART OF AFGHANISTAN
THAT BROKE DOWN, DIDN'T IT  Jon: DID THAT BREAK DOWN. IS THE HOPE HERE THAT THE  ELECTION IN SOME WAYS BREAKS  THIS WEIRD POLITICIZED FEVER IN THE WAY HURRICANE SANDY BROKE  THAT FEVER FOR, LET'S SAY, SOME  OF THE LOCAL GOVERNORS AND PEOPLE WILL REALIZE, OH, RIGHT,  WE ALL SHOULD PROBABLY DO  SOMETHING.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY PAY  ATTENTION. I HOPE IT DOES. I HOPE PEOPLE START PAYING  ATTENTION AGAIN. I THINK WHOEVER IS PRESIDENT  WILL PROBABLY ENGAGE OR REENGAGE  IN THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN. HOPEFULLY AMERICANS CAN FIGURE  OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THERE  AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
Jon: I WON'T ASK YOU FOR A  PREDICTION BUT I WILL ASK YOU  THIS. NADER? DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE NADER?
I'LL GO THERE  Jon: MARTHA, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH FOR JOINING US. BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. YOU CAN SEE MARTHA RADDATZ  ALTHOUGH YOU WON'T BE WATCHING  BUT YOU'LL BE WATCHING COMEDY CENTRAL WHICH I IMAGINE WE'LL  ALSO BE QUITE GOOD THAT NIGHT. MARTHA
