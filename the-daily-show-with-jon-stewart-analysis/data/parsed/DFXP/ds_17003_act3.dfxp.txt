Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, HE'S GOT A NEW FILM OUT CALLED "REAL STEEL."
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE GETTING THIS, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.
COME ON.
GIVE ME A MINUTE. I KNOW YOU CAN'T HEAR ME, BUT YOU CAN SEE ME. WATCH ME. WATCH ME.
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO A ROBOT.
I KNOW. SHUT UP. WATCH ME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW HUGH JACKMAN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NICE, NICE.
Jon: I WILL... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THE FAN, THE FANS. NICE, NICE.
Jon: THIS IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE BAD BEFORE-AND-AFTER MAGAZINE PICTURES. ONCE I STARTED TAKING CITRICAL, MY LIFE TURNED AROUND.
MY BALLS ARE THE SIZE OF A RAISIN.
Jon: I WOULD GO ANYWHERE, I WOULD PAY ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY TO SEE ROBOTS.
WHY NOT?
Jon: BECAUSE THOSE BASTARDS, THIS MOVIE IS ROBOT BOXING, IS IT NOT?
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S IN THE FUTURE, AND ROBOTS...
Jon: WHAT, EIGHT?
EIGHT. THAT'S IT.
Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE IS EIGHT YEARS.
YOUR BOXING CAREER, YOU BETTER GET IT STARTED, MAN.
Jon: TONIGHT WHEN I GET HOME, YOU'RE GOING DOWN, ROOMBA.
IT'S THE YEAR 2020, AND IT'S THE BIGGEST SPORT IN THE WORLD, NINE-FOOT ROBOTS DUKING IT OUT.
Jon: WHAT AN AWESOME...
RIGHT.
Jon: I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS. I LIKE WATCHING REGULAR BOXING, BUT I FEAR FOR THE COMBATANTS.
RIGHT. JON JON IN ROBOT BOXING, IT WOULD BE... IF YOU POPPED OFF ONE OF THEIR HEADS, YOU'D BE  LIKE, AWESOME.
MY SIX-YEAR-OLD AVA WAS WATCHING IT. SHE'S LIKE, YEAH, NOISY BOY, TAKE HIS HEAD OFF. SHE WAS GOING FOR IT. I KNOW, IT'S GOOD.
Jon: NOISY BOY?
NOISY BOY. THAT'S HER FAVORITE. SHE'S A MOSH PIT AC/DC GIRL. MY GIRL. I'M IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IN TEN YEARS.
Jon: I'VE MET THE GIRL. YOU'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE NOW. ARE YOU TRAINED IN THE ART OF...
ROBOT BOXING?
Jon: BOXING? YOU HAD TO LEARN TO BOX?
YEAH. WELL, THERE'S ONE SCENE WHERE I'M AN EX-BOXER IN THE FILM. THERE'S ONE SCENE WHERE YOU HAVE TO SEE I'M AN EX-BOXER. THEY GAVE US SUGAR RAY LEONARD AS A CONSULTANT. THEY SAID, HUGH, SORRY WE DIDN'T CHECK WITH YOU, SUGAR RAY IS HIRED AS A CONSULTANT. ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT? I'M LIKE, WHAT? THE BEST BOXER IN THE HISTORY OF BOXING IS MY PERSONAL TRAINER.
Jon: POUND FOR POUND.
I FELT QUIETLY CONFIDENT. I HAD BEEN TRAINING. HE SAID, SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT. I SHOWED HIM AND HE'S LIKE, REALLY? HE'S LIKE, MAN, WE BETTER GET TO WORK. MY NAME IS ON THIS PICTURE. THAT'S SUGAR RAY.
Jon: DID HE HAVE YOU CHASING A CHICKEN AROUND THE RING? EVEN NOW HIS REFLEX, IF HE WANTED TO, HE CAN WITHOUT YOU REALIZING IT JUST PUT OUT ONE OF  YOUR EYEBALLS AND YOU'D BE LIKE...
HAVE YOU MET HIM?
I MET HIM A COUPLE TIMES.
HE LOOKS TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S NEVER BEEN HIT ONCE IN HIS LIFE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THE SURGEON IS, BUT HE'S AWESOME, REALLY AWESOME.
Jon: SOME OF THE GREATEST FIGHTS OF ALL TIME, SUGAR RAY LEONARD. I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THOSE GUYS BECAUSE YOU THINK AS THEY AGE, YOU WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENED.
HE'S THE POSTER CHILD. SUGAR RAY IS IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT SPORT AND YOU WANT TO COME OUT  AND BE THE BEST, SUGAR RAY IS IT BECAUSE... AND HE'S BELOVED. YOU KNOW, HIS LEG IS...
Jon: AND SHE'S SHARP. VERY WITTY, VERY SMART. BY THE WAY, WHEN HE PUNCHES YOU IN THE TOM Mac, MAN THAT HURT.
LIKE YOU ANDRY DOING, THEN BEHIND THE SCENES, CAMERA TURNED ON, SOME GUY SAID D.V.D., AWESOME, SUGAR RAY. JUST OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE, THE RED LIGHT, BANG.
Jon: HE JUST DROPPED YOU.
I CRIED. ON THE D.V.D. EXTRA. BEST PART OF THE MOVIE.
Jon: EVERY MOVIE YOU'RE IN, IT'S ALWAYS HUGH JACKMAN IS GUY WHO CLIMBS MOUNTAIN WITH ONE HAND. CAN'T YOU GET A THING WHERE IT'S LIKE HUGH JACKMAN LOVES PIE.
YES.
Jon: IT'S LIKE YOU SITTING AROUND EATING PIE.
TWICE, TWICE I'VE SIGNED UP FOR MOVIES LIKE THAT. LEE DANIELS WAS GOING TO DO A FILM CALLED SELMA. AND I WAS GOING TO PLAY CLARK, THE MARTIN LUTHER KING STORY. SO I HAD TO PUT ON A WHOLE LOT OF WEIGHT. CLARK WORE HIS PANTS UP HERE, FAMOUS FOR BEING ON THE FRONT PAGE OF "NEW YORK TIMES" FOR HITTING THE WOMAN ON HIS HEAD  AND HE'S MASSIVE. SO I PUT ON SO MUCH WEIGHT. I DID SO MUCH RESEARCH. WE WENT TO ITALY TO PUT ON WEIGHT. MY WIFE, AND DEB AND I WERE WALKING ALONG IN ITALY, AND SHE'S LIKE, WOW, HUGH, YOUR ASS  HAS GOT ITS OWN ZIP CODE. SHE LIKED IT I THINK.
WELL, YOU KNOW...
FILM GETS CANCELLED.
Jon: NOW LOOK AT YOU. PRETTY SOON, THIS REALLY IS WEIRD, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DRAINED ALL MY BLOOD AND JUST ADD IT TO YOU. BY THE WAY, ON BROADWAY WHEN?
OCTOBER 25th.
Jon: OCTOBER 25th. HOW LONG YOU GOING TO BE THERE?
TEN WEEKS.
Jon: TEN WEEKS.
18-PIECE ORCHESTRA.
Jon: YOU GOT TO SEE THIS GUY. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS BUSINESS WITH ACTUAL TALENT. HE'S ONE OF THEM. YOU GOT TO GO SEE IT. "REAL STEEL" IS IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY. HUGH JACKMAN.
