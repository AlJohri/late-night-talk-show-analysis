( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE WROTE THE FORWARD TO THE BOOK THAT ACCOMPANIES THE RECORDED  CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN HER MOTHER, JACQUELINE KENNEDY, AND ARTHUR SCHLESINGER CALLED  "JACQUELINE KENNEDY, HISTORIC CONVERSATIONS ON LIFE WITH JOHN F. KENNEDY."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, CAROLINE KENNEDY. ( APPLAUSE ) SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
YOU, TOO.
Jon:  THANKS FOR COMING. IT'S TRANSCRIPTS. I READ AN AWFUL LOT OF HISTORICAL NONFICTION ON THE SHOW BECAUSE I DON'T WANT OR HAVE A LIFE. BUT... ( LAUGHTER )
THAT WAS CLEAR FROM EARLIER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT OUR PROP PEOPLE HAD TO GO THROUGH TODAY. THIS TRULY IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE PIECES OF HISTORY  I'VE-- I'VE EVER READ, I'VE EVER BEEN ENGAGED WITH. IT'S-- IT'S SO HUMAN TO HEAR-- I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR  YOU-- TELL ME-- TO HEAR YOUR MOTHER-- FOUR MONTHS AFTER YOUR FARTHER'S PASSING DISCUSSING IT  WITH THIS HISTORIAN.
WELL, I THINK FOR ME IT'S QUITE FAMILIAR BECAUSE I KNOW  HER, AND SO IT'S JUST NICE TO BE ABLE TO FEEL SORT OF A CONNECTION WITH HER IN THE WAY  SHE SOUGHT WORLD AGAIN. BUT I AM REALLY STRUCK BY HOW MUCH COURAGE IT TOOK FOR HER TO DO THIS AND HOW MUCH-- HOW  COMPLEX AND INTERESTING IT IS, AND IT REALLY BRINGS A WHOLE WORLD TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT-- IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION  IN THE LAST FEW DAYS-- BUT I THINK IF YOU SIT AND LISTEN OR READ WHOLE THING, IT IS LIKE  BEING IN ANOTHER WORLD. AND ALL THESE PERSONALS COME TO LIFE AND ALL THESE EVENTS, AND THERE'S SO MUCH HUMANITY THAT  GOES INTO THE MAKING OF HISTORY, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY COMES THROUGH. AND WHAT A GREAT OBSERVER SHE WAS.
Jon:  IT'S VERY RARE THAT SOMETHING JUMPS OUT. HISTORY SO OFTEN FOR US, YOU IMAGINE IT IN BLACK AND WHITE, BUT THIS JUMPS OUT IN SUCH STARK, VIVID COLOR. YOUR MOTHER'S REALLY FUNNY.
SHE'S REALLY FUNNY. SHE IS REALLY FUNNY. YOU DEFINITELY DIDN'T WANT TO GET ON HER BAD SIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD JUST RIDICULE YOU. BUT... ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  SHE'S TALKING TO ARTHUR SCHLESINGER AND HE'S  TALKING ABOUT THE DINNER PARTIES THAT THEY THREW, AND HE'S MENTIONING PEOPLE THAT ATTENDED  THEM, AND SHE'S MENTIONING SOME OF THE SENATORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND YOU KNOW, AT ONE POINT, SCHLESINGER SAID, THE COOPERS I THINK WERE THERE, AND HE SAYS, "THEY'RE THE NICEST." AND YOUR MOTHER, I CAN JUST IMAGINE, GOES, "MAYBE."  ( LAUGHTER ) AND IS THAT A MOMENT THAT RESONATES WITH YOU AS HER WIT?
WELL, I THINK SHE TO ME SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE SHE REALLY GETS GOING ARE MORE THE ONES  THAT RESONATE WITH ME.
Jon:  SUCH AS.
THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN. I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A GOOD EXAMPLE. WHEN SOMEONE-- WELL, THE SCENE THAT SHE DESCRIBES OF, YOU KNOW, I KEPT KNOW, INDIRRA GANDHI, OR SOMEONE SHE DIDN'T LIKE, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT OFTEN, BUT  WHEN SHE DIDN'T LIKE SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS REALLY FUN TO BE AROUND ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  NOT CRAZY ABOUT GANDHI, HUH? HOW DID KHRUSHCHEV FARE?
SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIS WIFE. SHE WAS A SOUR PUSS.
Jon:  REALLY? SHE DIDN'T LOOK IT. KHRUSHCHEV SENT HER A DOG.
I THAT WERE DOG. IT BIT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE DOG WAS A KGB AGENT. IT KNEW HOW TO GO DOWN THE SLIDE FROM THE TREE HOUSE TO THE GROUND. IT WAS REALLY PRETTY CUTE BUT IT WAS REALLY NERVOUS, AND SHE DESCRIBES HOW SHE THINKS IT HAD  NEVER OPINION OUT OF THE LABORATORY BECAUSE IT JUST BIT EVERYONE, ONE OF THE GARDNERS AT  THE WHITE HOUSE VERY NICELY TOOK IT HOME. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IT HAD PUPPIES, TOO. AND THERE WAS A CONTEST WHERE PEOPLE COULD WRITE IN WITH THEIR NAMES AND ON MY LAST BOOK TOUR I  MET SOMEBODY WHO HAD WRITTEN IN AND GOTTEN ONE OF THE PUPPIES.
Jon:  YOU'RE KIDDING. WAS IT A REVENGE THERE'S A RUSSIAN HALF BREED SOMEWHERE. I DON'T UPON.
Jon:  WERE YOU EVER-- IS THERE ANY ANY MOMENT IN HERE-- YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE READ THROUGH  THIS-- WHERE YOU POP UP? WAS THERE EVER A, "CAROLINE?"
MY BROTHER, OF COURSE, IS INTERRUPTING BUT NOT ME.
Jon:  REALLY.
HE GOES, OUT, OUT. BUT HE'S REALLY CUTE. IT'S ADORABLE WHEN HE ENEMIES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING. PROBABLY READING.
Jon:  EMOTIONAL STRENGTH MUST BE SOMETHING THAT IS SO GENETICALLY ADHERED TO YOUR FAMILY. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE FOR YOU TO EVEN HAVE STRENGTH TO TALK ABOUT IT IS KIND OF REMARKABLE. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D BE ABLE TO-- MAYBE I DON'T PROCESS EMOTION VERY WELL  ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, I KNOW I DON'T PROCESS EMOTION VERY WELL. I FIND YOUR ABILITY TO GET GREAT PLEASURE OUT OF IT REALLY UPLIFTING FOR SOME REASON.
WELL, THANK YOU. IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME. BUT I FEEL LIKE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT I, YOU KNOW, LOVE AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE ABLE TO SHARE  THEM AND SO MANY PEOPLE GROWING UP LOVED THEM, TOO. AND I FEEL LIKE FOR ME THAT'S BEEN A GREAT GIFT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THEY LIVE ON THROUGH ALL  PEOPLE THAT ADMIRED THEM AND THAT'S REALLY A TRICK AND I'M VERY LUCKY TO BE THERE CHILD. IT'S NICE. AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW, IT'S CONTROVERSIAL. SHE, OBVIOUSLY, SAYS A LOT OF CONTROVERSIAL THINGS. BUT SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING, AND SHE ALWAYS SAID SHE'D PUT IT AWAY FOR 50 YEARS. SO THERE WAS A KIND OF-- YOU KNOW, I REALLY THOUGHT CAREFULLY ABOUT IT AND I ASKED MY CHILDREN  TO READ IT, TOO, AND IT SEEMED LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF MY  FARTHER'S PRESIDENCY AND SHE SHOULD BE A PART OF IT AND PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY GET A  CHANCE TO SEE AND HEAR HOW HER MIND WORKED.
Jon:  THE CAPPEDDOR IS REMARKABLE. THEY'RE VERY GOSSIPY, THE TWO OF THEM.
ARTHUR SCHLESINGER IS A MASTER.
Jon:  TWOLY-- TWO LADIES SITTING AROUND CHATTING.
HE EGGS HER OTOO.
Jon:  IT'S REALLY A WONDERFUL GIFT YOU GUYS HAVE GIVEN EVERYBODY. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. CAROLINE KENNEDY.
