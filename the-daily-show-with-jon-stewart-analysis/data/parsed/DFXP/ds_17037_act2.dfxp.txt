(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE REPUBLICAN RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT WHAT OF THE MAN THEY ARE ALL CLAMORING TO REPLACE? ONE MILLARD FILLMORE. WAIT, HOW OLD IS THIS SCRIPT? ALL RIGHT. BARACK OBAMA. AH, BARACK OBAMA. OOH. OOH. (LAUGHTER) THE SOCIALIST MUSLIM KENYAN CHRISTIAN. (LAUGHTER) I WONDER WHAT PERMANENT DAMAGE HE'S DONE TO OUR COUNTRY FROM  HIS LABORATORY OF POWER GRABBING THAT HE INHABITS BETWEEN THE SMALL WINDOW BETWEEN CHRISTMAS  AND NEW YEAR'S. HE'S SO DANGEROUS.
IN HIS LAST OFFICIAL ACT OF THE YEAR, A VACATIONING PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED THE $662  BILLION MILITARY SPENDING BILL IN HAWAII.
IT ALLOWS THE MILITARY TO INDEFINITELY DETAIN TERROR SUSPECTS, INCLUDING AMERICAN  CITIZENS IN THE U.S. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I WAS KIDDING. I WAS IRONICALLY PORTRAYING A CHARACTER WHO BELIEVE IT IS PRESIDENT IS EXERCISING  EXECUTIVE POWER IN AN UNWARRANTED FASHION CREATING HUMOR THROUGH THE JUXTAPOSITION OF (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) SO THE LAST THING THE PRESIDENT DID IN 2011 WAS SIGN A BILL THAT  PRETTY MUCH DOES AWAY WITH DUE PROCESS FOR ANYONE SUSPECTED OF TERRORISM IN AMERICA? NO WONDER HE SIGNED IT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. THE ONE NIGHT THE MEDIA'S MOST TENACIOUS REPORTER, MR. KEEPING  THEM HONEST, WOULD BE COMPLETELY DISTRACTED. (LAUGHTER) ANDERSON COOPER COULDN'T KEEP THE PRESIDENT HONEST. HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP KATHY GRIFFIN'S SHIRT ON. (LAUGHTER) STILL, I CANNOT BELIEVE BARACK OBAMA SIGNED THE PROVISION.
THE PRESIDENT SIGNED IT RELUCTANTLY.
Jon: OH. (LAUGHTER) WELL, NOW I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AS LONG AS HE SIGNS THE BILL ALLOWING FOR  AMERICANS' INDEFINITE DETENTION WHILE SIGHING... (LAUGHTER). PERHAPS HE INCLUDED AN APPROPRIATE EMOTICON WITH HIS SIGNATURE. (LAUGHTER) OH, I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT YOU TO NOT HAVE A LAWYER BUT... (LAUGHTER). ACTUALLY, WHEN SIGNING THE BILL, THE PRESIDENT ISSUED A SIGNING STATEMENT. THE PRESIDENTIAL EXPRESSION OF OBJECTION OR INTERPRETATION WHICH SAID IN PART "ALTHOUGH  THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN AMERICANS INDEFINITELY..." I'LL LET HIM FINISH.
MY ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT AUTHORIZE THE INDEFINITE MILITARY DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL  OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Jon: WHOO! SEE, PRESIDENTS CAN-- BUT HE WON'T-- WHICH IS GREAT SINCE HE'LL ALWAYS BE PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)
HI, JON, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: I KNOW THAT VOICE.
IT'S ME! GITMO!
Jon: OH, MY GOD, GITMO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HELLO! JON, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE BOY BAND?
Jon: UM, I GUESS I'M A NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK KIND OF GUY. BUT SINCE THEY STARTED A SUPERGROUP WITH THE BACK STREET BOYS I'M NOT SURE... WAIT, WHY  DO YOU CARE?
GITMO WANTS TO KNOW WHAT POSTER TO HANG IN YOUR CELL! YOUR. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I GET IT. YOU THINK BECAUSE OF THE NEW LAW ANYONE CAN BE ARRESTED FOR BEING A TERRORIST. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, GITMO.
RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) JUST LIKE IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO FUZZY RED CAB DRIVER WHOSE STUDENT VISA EXPIRED. GITMO WAS ONLY SIX CREDITS AWAY FROM DOCTORATE. LA, LA, LA, LA.
Jon: WHAT WAS THAT, GITMO?
THAT'S... (LAUGHTER).
Jon: AH. AH. I WAS JUST LIP SYNCING. (LAUGHTER) BUT, GITMO, THE NEW LAW GUARANTEES THAT DETAINEES WILL HAVE THEIR CASES PERIODICALLY REVIEWED.
YEAH. EVERY THREE YEARS. SO ONLY 36 MORE MONTHS TILL GITMO GETS TO TAKE WINDOWLESS BUS RIDE TO WINDOWLESS BUILDING. (LAUGHTER) YAY! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: HEY, MAN. YOU NEVER KNOW. MAYBE SOMEDAY THEY'LL FIND EVIDENCE THAT WILL SET YOU FREE.
YES. MAYBE ONE DAY HAND SOME YOUNG LAWYER WILL FIND DUSTY FILE BEHIND CABINET. MAYBE FILE WILL PROVE GITMO JUST INNOCENT CAB DRIVER. MAYBE STORY INSPIRE MOVIE STARRING RYAN GOSLING AS LAWYER. (LAUGHTER) AND ZOE SALDANA AS STERN YET SEXY JUDGE. I THINK I KNOW WHAT MOVIE WILL BE CALLED. MOVIE WILL BE CALLED "IT'S NEVER GONNA (BLEEP)ING HAPPEN." (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'M SORRY, GITMO. I FEEL FORYOU. I FEEL FOR YOU, GITMO. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNING STATEMENT SAID THAT HE  WASN'T GOING TO USE THIS LAW TO ROUND UP U.S. CITIZENS.
RIGHT. OH, NEW FRIEND!
HOW DO YOU DO, JOHNNY BEEF STEW?
Jon: OH, MY GOSH! MICHAEL STEELE! FORMER REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN MICHAEL STEELE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN GAN TAN KNOW, PRISON.
I'M NOT AL B. SURE. ONE MINUTE I'M ON MY PHONE BUYING PLANE TICKETS TO DUBAI TELLING MY TRAVEL AGENT I WANT  TO STAY AT THAT GIANT HOTEL FROM "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE." BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BOMB. NEXT THING I KNOW, THE F.B.I.'S KICKING DOWN MY DOOR AND HEAR I AM CHILLAXING IN KOKOMO. I GUESS THEY THOUGHT I WAS PLOTTING SOMETHING IN ARA-BIBBLE ISN'T THAT RIBIBBULOUS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S TERRI-BIBBLE.
STILL, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, MORE PEOPLE WILL SEE ME HERE THAN WHEN I WORKED AT MSNBC, HONEYBEE.
Jon: .
AND YOU MADE A NEW FRIEND. FRIENDS FOREVER.
NO! NO! YOU'VE GOT TO GET ME OUT OF HERE, PAUL REVERE! OH!
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (C
