Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW, WE KNOW THAT A RICK SANTORUM ADMINISTRATION WOULD LOOK TO THE VATICAN FOR  INSPIRATION BUT HOW WOULD SANTORUM GET THOSE MESSAGES OF INSPIRATION? LAST WEEK IT BECAME CLEAR.
THE PONTIFICAL COUNSEL FOR SOCIAL COMMUNICATIONS OR BONE  POPE BENEDICT'S MEDIA TEAM IS USING TWITTER TO GET CATHOLICS TO FOCUS ONLESS. HE'S USING A iPAD TO POST SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE ON TWITTER.
Jon: THE POPE HAS AN iPAD? WHAT HAVE THE PIGS DONE TO ANGER THE BIRDS? THE GREEN BOOMERANGY BIRDS. WHY CAN NOT THIS BIRD LEARN FORGIVENESS? IF A 2,000-YEAR-OLD INSTITUTION IS DOING, IT'S GOT TO BE CUTTING EDGE. WHERE DO I FIND THIS HOLY TWITTER FEED?
POPE BENEDICT WILL TWEET SOME OF HIS THEMES FOR THIS SEASON AT POPE-2-YOU-VET CAN.
Jon: WHAT? THE POPE CAN'T GET A STRAIGHT-UP TWITTER HANDLE? THE POPE? THAT IS WEAK, TWITTER. THAT IS TWEAK. ALTHOUGH IT IS THE INSPIRATION FOR MY NEW OFF BROADWAY SHOW, POPE BENEDICT XVI CHOOSES HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT. I HAD TO GO WITH A CHEF'S HAT AND A 20-YEAR-OLD I-MAC FOR SOME REASON. AS A JEW I'M NOT LICENSED TO GO FULL MITRE. POPE BENEDICT 16 CHOOSES HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT. WWW.TWITTER.COM. CLICK ON NEW ACCOUNT. USER NAME. THE POPE. ALREADY TAKEN. WHAT? I'M THE POPE. WHAT ABOUT THE REAL POPE? HOW CAN THAT BE TAKEN? I'M THE POPE. THE HOLY POPE. SON OF A BITCH. POPE WITH A ZERO FOR THE O. THE ACTUAL HOLY SEE. POPE BENEDICT XVI, MOTHER (BEEP). I'LL JUST GO WITH POPE-2-YOU. THAT'S TAKEN? POPE-2-YOU... ARE YOU WATCHING THIS? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  A ONE-MAN SHOW. WHAT? IT'S CLOSED ALREADY? NOW THAT THE POPE IS ONLINE THOUGH, WELL, WHAT'S THE POPE GOING TO PUT OUT THERE?
MANY OF THE KEY IDEAS OF THE GOSPEL FIT VERY NICELY INTO 140 CHARACTERS.
VERY CONVENIENT.
Jon: IT IS VERY CONVENIENT ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IF YOU KNOW THE PASSAGE FROM THE 23rd PSALM THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE  SHADOW OF DEATH, I WILL FEAR... OH, BOY. SO CLOSE. OF COURSE, THERE IS ONE MESSAGE THE POPE REALLY DOES WANT TO GET ACROSS.
GOOD TO SEE THE POPE IS COMMUNICATING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. A GREAT IDEA.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT BETTER WAY FOR A SELL BAIT PERSON TO... I  CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE YOU COULD DO. HASH TAG, NOTHING COMES TO
