Jon:  WELCOME BACK. WE JUST WENT THROUGH AN INSIGNE  WEEK. EVERYTHING SEEMS VERY  UNPREDICTABLE, EVEN TERRIFYING. IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THERE'S ONE  THING WE CAN COUNT ON.
THERE'S A STORM COMING.
ONE WE ARE ALL GOING TO FEEL. IT'S CALLED INFLATION.
GOLD GIVES ME FREEDOM FROM  ALL THE FINANCIAL MAD INNOCENCE  THE WORLD.
GOLD IS THE TIME-TESTED  CURRENCE THEY GOES UP, NOT DOWN.
Jon:  YOU KNOW, THAT  CONVICTED FELON MAKES A LOT OF  SENSE. ( LAUGHTER ). ALTHOUGH, FIRECALL, HE DIDN'T  KNOW HE OR NIXON WOULD EVER GO  DOWN, EITHER. GOLD! IT'S THE ULTIMATE SEAR HEDGE. WHEN THE DOLLAR FAILS AND THE  WORLD PLUNGES INTO A DISPOPIAN  NIGHTMARE, VICIOUS TRIBES WARRING FOR DWINDLING  NECESSITIES, YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE  GOLD. ( LAUGHTER )  EXCUSE ME, GOOD SIR. YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN WHO  APPRECIATES THE FINER THINGS. MIGHT I INTEREST YOU IN SOME  KRUGERRANDS IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME  OF YOUR PROCESSED COMBUSTION ENGINE FUEL? NO, THEN HOW ABOUT I BECOME YOUR  WIFE. ( LAUGHTER ). FORTUNATELY, THAT'S NEVER GOING  TO HAPPEN BECAUSE GOLD GOES UP  NOT DOWN.
WE KNOW GOLD IS 25% FROM ITS  PEAK IN THE MIDDLE OF 2011, AND  IT GOT CRUSHED IN RECENT DAYS.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT TRAP  DOOR OPENED UP AND GOLD FELL.
THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY DROP IN  PRICES IN 33 YEARS ON MONDAY  WITH PRICES FALLING $140.
I'M CALLING IT A CRASH IN THE  LAST TWO DAYS.
A CRASH AND A HALF.
Jon:  WHOA! A CRASH AND A HALF! THAT IS GAD BAD NEWS FOR GOLD  INVESTORS AND A TERRIBLE MOVIE  SEQUEL. ( LAUGHTER ). LIKE EVERY OTHER COMMODITY IN  THE HISTORY OF MARKETS. UNLESS...
THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO FEAR  IS THE GOVERNMENT, QUITE  FRANKLY. THE GOVERNMENT LYING TO YOU. THE MEDIA NOT TELLING YOU TRUTH. I MEAN, GOLD IS THE ORIGINAL  GOLD STANDARD, AND SOMETHING  DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT.
Jon:  I'VE MISSED YOU SO  MUCH. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  SO THE CHOICE IS CLEAR-- EITHER  AN IRRATIONALLY OVERPRICED COMMODITY AT A TOTALLY NORMAL  PREDICTABLE PRICE COLLECTION OR  EVERYONE IS LYING TO TRICK US INTO SELLING OUR PRECIOUS GOLD. IF YOU CAN'T TRUST THE CNBC  TICKER, WHO SHOULD WE LISTEN TO?
DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE BUT  YOURSELF. DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK. USE YOUR COMMON SENSE, AND THEN  LISTEN TO THE ULTIMATE ADVISER,  GOD.
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT? ( LAUGHTER )  YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, LET ME  SEE HERE. WHAT DOES GOD SAY ABOUT  IDOLIZING GOLD FAZ IT HAS SUPER  NATURAL POWERS. "IF I HAVE PUT MY TRUST IN GOLD  OR SAID TO PURE GOLD YOU ARE MY  SECURITY I WOULD HAVE UNFAITHFUL TO GOD ON HIGH. THAT'S AMBIGUOUS. EXODUS, CHAPTER 32. "WHAT A GREAT SIN SHE'S PEOPLE  HAVE COMMITTED. THEY'VE MADE THEMSELVES GOD OF  GOLD. IN OTHER WORDS... I BELIEVE  THAT'S A SELL. ( APPLAUSE )  YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE POINT OF  TURNING TO GOD FOR GOLD--
FOR ONCE, JON, I THINK WE  HAVE SOMETHING WE CAN AGREE ON.
Jon:  OH, MY GOD IT'S  MILLIONAIRE JOHN HODGMAN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ARE YOU STILL A MILLIONAIRE,  RIGHT? YOU ARE STILL A MILLIONAIRE,  RIGHT, OR DID YOU LOSE IT ALL IN  GOLD?
JON, I'M NO RUBE. WHAT WOULD I WANT WENT WITH  SMELLY NUGGETS THAT ANY  PROSPECTOR CAN TAKE OUT OF A  CREEK. >>CREEK. IT'S COMPLETE RIDICULOUS, JON. GOLD, IT'S NO BERYLLIUM.
Jon:  WHAT? BERYLLIUM?
YES, THAT'S A DIFFERENT  RANDOM SUBSTANCE, BUT THIS ONE  IS IMMUNE TO MARKET FORCES. HERE, LET ME SHOW OW MY PERIODIC  TAIB OF INVEST ELEMENTS. NOW, HERE IS GOLD. THAT IS GARBAGE. PLATINUM AND SILVER GOING THE  SAME WAY.
Jon:  SURE, SURE, SURE,  SURE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO INVEST  IN, JON?
Jon:  HELIUM IS ALWAYS  FUN AT PARTIES, I GUESS.
HELIUM, YOU CAN'T MAKE A  COMMEMORATIVE COIN OUT OF  HELIUM. FIRST RULE OF INVEST ELEMENTS,  JON-- NOBLE GASES, ( BLEEP )  RETURNS. GOOD-BYE.
Jon:  BUT, BUT,  BERYLLIUM. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BERYLLIUM.
AH, BERYLLIUM. ALL UNDERSTAND INSTINCTIVELY THE  TIMELESS ALLURE OF BERYLLIUM. THAT'S WHERE ALL DERANGED  MILLIONAIRES PUT OUR EXPHN NOW  THANKS TO ME, SO CAN YOU. OH, HEY, I'M JOHN HODGMAN FOR  BERYLLIUM. YOU KNOW, DON'T LET PEOPLE SCARE  YOU INTO BUYING GOLD. LET ME SCARE YOU INTO BUYING  BERYLLIUM. PRIZED BY HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS  SINCE 1957 FOR ITS DRAB GRAY  COLOR, BERYLLIUM IS AS VERSATILE AS IT IS SOLID. LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL DIMES. NOW THAT I'VE COATED THEM IN  RARE BERYLLIUM DUST I'M SELLING  THEM FOR $300,000. BERYLLIUM IS NOT JUST FOR  COATING COINS. IT CAN ALSO BE FASHIONED INTO  SOME BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY. BERYLLIUM, INVEST IN THE FUTURE. CAUTION, DO NOT FASHION INTO  BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY. BRIMMUAL IS HIGHLY CORROSIVE TO  HUMAN SKIN. IT IS A CARCINOGEN.
Jon:  IT'S BURNING MY  HANDS! WOW, THAT'SAB INTRIGUING  PRODUCT. I CAN'T HELP NOTICING, YOU'RE  LOSING SOME HAIR NOW.
WELL, THE RISKS ARE-- OH! UH, UH, ANOTHER ON MOELLER. SO, HOW MUCH BERYLLIUM CAN I PUT  YOU DOWN FOR, JON?
Jon:  I'LL GET BACK TO
