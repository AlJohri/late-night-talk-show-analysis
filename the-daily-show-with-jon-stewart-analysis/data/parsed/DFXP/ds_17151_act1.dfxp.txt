Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART. WE'RE BACK HOME, BABY. BACK FROM THE CONVENTIONS. VERY EXCITEDDED TONIGHT. ON OUR PROGRAM KOFI ANNAN WILL  BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM. FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE  UNITED NATIONS. WHAT AN EVENTFUL WEEK. REMEMBER THE INTERNET, THE  MAGICAL FORCE THAT SHOWERED  DEMOCRACY ON THE MIDDLE EAST
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ARAB  SPRING, HOW WERE PEOPLE ABLE TO  AMASS IN VARIOUS PLACES? TWITTER
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE  THE ROLE THE INTERNET HAS  PLAYED. THE ARAB SPRING WOULDN'T HAVE  HAPPENED WITHOUT TWITTER AND  WITHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA
Jon: TRUE. IT'S TRUE. OF COURSE HERE WE USE IT TO BLOG  THE X-FACTOR. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IT'S AN  EXCITING TIME FOR TWITTER. HEY, WHAT ELSE IS ON THE  INTERNET? LET ME SEE. THAT'S NOT ARAB SPRING. DEMOCRACY, NO FREEDOM. YEAH, THAT'S... I DON'T KNOW  WHAT THAT IS. WHAT'S THIS?
AN INCREDIBLY AMATEURISH,  CRUDE AND NASTY MOVIE MADE IN  THE UNITED STATES AND RELEASED  ON YOU-TUBE, "INNOCENCE OF MUSLIMS" IT'S CALLED. IT DEPICTS THE PROPHET MOHAMMED  AS A DOPE, A FRAUD, A PEDOPHILE  AND WOMANIZER
Jon: IT'S YOU-TUBE. I MEAN NOBODY PAYS ATTENTION TO  YOU-TUBE. WHY NOT HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT. THAT WILL BE THE LAST WE HEAR OF  IT. WHAT'S THAT NOW IN
U.S. EMBASSIES AND  CONTINUESATE LaS UNDER SIEGE  IN MIDDLE EAST. AFRICA AND EVEN ASIA. THIS MAP SHOWS THE UNREST  SPREADING TO MORE THAN A DOZEN  NATIONS.
Jon: I SEE. THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S  SEGMENT, ACTUAL DEMOCALYPSE. ALL THIS DESTRUCTION AND  BLOODSHED WAS OVER A DUMB  INTERNET VIDEO MADE BY SOME [BLEEP]. AND PROMOTED BY...   ( APPLAUSE )   ... AND IT WAS PROMOTED BY THE  KORAN-BURNING FLORIDA PASTOR  TERRY JONES. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLIP OF HIM  AS WELL.
A VERY NAUGHTY BOY. NOW GO AWAY.
WHO ARE YOU? I'M HIS MOTHER, THAT'S WHO  Jon: I'M BEING TOLD THAT IS A  VERY DIFFERENT TERRY JONES  MOCKING A DIFFERENT WORLD RELIGION IN A FILM THAT HAS BEEN  ROUND FOR 3 YEARS. WELL, THAT MUST BE A LOT OF  BURNED EMBASSIES... REALLY? NONE AT ALL. FAIR ENOUGH. LOOK, I'M ALL ABOUT CULTURAL  SENSITIVITY. THE WHOLE POINT OF MY 1996 RAB  ALBUM. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T  UNDERSTAND THIS ONE. AN ONLINE FILM THAT NOBODY HAS  SEEN MADE BY SOME [BLEEP] IS A  PRETEXT FOR VIOLENCE. SOME OF THE LEADERS ARE  DELIBERATELY EXPLOITING WHATEVER  THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON TO  RILE UP THE POPULOUS FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAIN. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU REALLY ARE GETTING THE HANG  OF THIS DEMOCRACY THING PRETTY  FAST. BY THE WAY, NO ONE OVER THERE  WAS FREAKING OUT WHEN EGYPTIAN  STATE TELEVISION AIRED A MOVIE  BASED ON THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION WHICH HAS WON THE  OSCAR FOR MOST INSULTING FILM  EVER SINCE MOVIES WERE INVENTED. THE WHOLE "JEWS RULE THE WORLD  AND KILL CHRISTIAN BABIES."  IT'S A TAD OFFENSIVE. DID THE JEWS GET REVENGE BY  BURNING EMBASSIES. NO WE GOT OUR REVENGE IN THE  OLD-FASHIONED WAY, A BAD REVIEW  IN THE TIMES AND A RATHER WRY  CARTOON POKING FUN OF A FILM IN THE NEW YORKER WITH A CAT AS A  FILM CRITIC WHO DOESN'T WANT... IT'S VERY WRY. THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO BE A  MATURE COUNTRY YOU NEED A BETTER  WAY TO EXPRESS YOUR VIEWING  DISPLEASURE. THE RATING SYSTEM. I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS OFF. YOU HAVE TO FIND SYMBOLISM. FOR MORE ON THIS I'M JOINED BY  JOHN OLIVER LIVE IN CAIRO. JOHN, HOW IS EVERYTHING GOING? WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S HAPPENING. JON, IT'S BEAUTIFUL HERE, JON. FRIENDLY PEOPLE. RICH HISTORY. DELICIOUS FOOD. I'M HAVING A FANTASTIC TIME
Jon: REALLY? THAT'S GREAT
NOT REALLY, JON. OF COURSE NOT. HAVE YOU BEEN NEAR A [BLEEP] TELEVISION RECENTLY? THINGS ARE PRETTY BAD AROUND  HERE. LOOK, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR  US ALL TO PAUSE AND NOTE THAT IT  IS CLEARLY NOT THE MAJORITY OF  MUSLIMS WHO ARE PROTESTING IN THE STREETS. IT'S NOT EVEN THE MAJORITY OF  PROTESTORS WHO ARE GETTING  VIOLENT. TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT, WE  SHOULD REALLY REMEMBER ISLAM'S  YOUNG AGE.
Jon: IT'S 1400 YEARS OLD  EXACTLY, JON. IN RELIGIOUS YEARS ISLAM IS  STILL JUST A TEENAGER. PUT IT IN CONTEXT. THINK WHAT CHRISTIANITY WAS  DOING WHEN IT WAS ONLY 1400  YEARS OLD.
Jon: NO, THAT'S NOT... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YEAH, I GUESS THAT IS.   ..
EXACTLY. BLOODY CRUSADES, THE  INQUISITION, EXECUTION OF HAIR  TICKS. CHRISTIANITY IS JUST LUCKY THERE  WEREN'T CELL PHONES AROUND THEN  TO FILM THAT [BLEEP].
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? I MEAN, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,  WHEN JUDAISM WAS STILL A  TEENAGER
JUDAISM, ARE YOU KIDDING ME. on: YEAH  YOU PEOPLE COULDN'T KEEP YOUR  TEENAGE SHOFARS IN YOUR TUNICS. BEGETTING IN CANAAN
Jon: BEGETTING IN BABYLON. WE WERE BEGETTING SO MUCH WE  COULDN'T EVEN STAND ON A  MOUNTAIN WITHOUT HAVING TO HOLD  A TABLET IN FRONT OF OUR... YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU PEOPLE NEARLY BEGAT  YOURSELVES BLIND. THE POINT IS IS, JON, THERE IS  GOOD NEWS. THAT IS THAT RELIGIONS GROW OUT  OF THIS AWKWARD PHASE. AGAIN LOOK AT CHRISTIANITY. WE'VE AGED INTO YOUNG ADULTHOOD. NOW WE CAN ALL LAUGH ABOUT THE  TIME WE USED TO BURN YOUNG GIRLS  AT THE STAKE FOR BEING  LEFT-HANDED. OR AS WE CALLED IT BACK THEN,  WITCH CRAFT.
Jon: YEAH, I DON'T THINK  THAT'S SO FUNNY.
JON, THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR  RELIGION IS... IN FACT, HOW OLD  ARE YOU?
Jon: WE'RE 5773 TODAY. OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T LOOK A  DAY OVER 5729. THAT'S A FACT.
Jon: WE'VE BEEN JOGGING. YOU'RE GLOWING. IT'S WORKING. THE POINT, JON, IS THAT WE NEED  TO BE PATIENT WITH ISLAM. THEY DO NOT HAVE IT EASY. REMEMBER, MOST TEENAGERS HAVE  SOME MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM THEIR  INSECURITY. THEY SMOKE POT. THEY EXPERIMENT WITH SEX. ALL NIGHT BACON PARTIES. REFORMATION. MUSLIMS CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT  STUFF RIGHT NOW.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING IF WE JUST  WAIT 300 TO 400 YEARS
HALF A MILLENNIUM AT MOST. Jon: THEN THERE WILL BE PEACE  PEACE? WHAT? [BLEEP] NO, JON. BUT IF WE'RE LUCKY, WE WILL  FINALLY STOP FIGHTING OVER REAL  OR IMAGINED INSULTS TO OUR  RELIGIONS AND GO BACK TO FIGHTING OVER WHAT REALLY  MATTERS: NATURAL RESOURCES AND  ARBITRARY LINES ON MAPS. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: JOHN OLIVER,
