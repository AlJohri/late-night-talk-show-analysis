John: WELCOME BACK. NOW, BEFORE THE BREAK, WE WERE  DISCUSSING STATE SENATOR WENDY  DAVIS' EPIC FILIBUSTER. WHERE SHE STOOD FOR OVER 11  HOURS IN TEXAS AND SOMEHOW DID  NOT WIN A BRAND NEW PICK-UP  TRUCK. FOR MORE ON THIS, WE ARE JOINED  BY OUR SENIOR WOMEN'S ISSUES  CORRESPONDENT KRISTIN SHELL. KRISTIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] KRISTIN, A RIVETTING, RIVETTING  NIGHT IN TEXAS, WAS IT NOT.
IT IS NOT OVER. WE'RE KEEPING THIS GOING ALL  NIGHT. I'M IN MY WINDY SUIT. I HAVE MY PINK SHOES. I BROUGHT MY PORTABLE BATHROBE. I EVEN GAVE MYSELF THIS TATTOO  TO CELEBRATE. I STAND WITH WENDY. CAN YOU READ THAT.
John: THAT IS HORRIBLE. IT'S ALSO UPSIDEDOWN.
IT READS RIGHT TO ME. John: WENDY REALLY GOT TO  YOU.
MAN, I'VE NEVER FELT SO  ALIVE. WOMEN ARE IN THE NEWS. NO ONE CAN STOP THIS [BLEEP] WAGON. [BLEEP].
John: SIT DOWN, KRISTIN. NOT UNTIL WENDY DOES. John: SHE'S PROBABLY SLEEPING  RIGHT NOW.
FOR ETERNITY. John: I DON'T THINK YOU JUST  SAID WHAT YOU MEANT.
THE POINT IS THIS HAS BEEN AN  EXCITING WEEK NOT JUST FOR THE  GREAT WENDY DAVIS BUT FOR THE EVEN GREATER TEXAS LADY JODY  LOVENBERG.
John: WHO IS SHE? A STATE REPRESENTATIVE WITH A  FANTASTIC IDEA FOR PREVENTING  PREGNANCIES FOR RAPE AND INCEST.
WE HAVE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY  ROOMS. WE HAVE FUNDED WHAT'S CALLED  (INAUDIBLE) THAT WILL HELP A  WOMAN.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSED  TO BE LOCKED AWAY AND FORGOTTEN  ABOUT. YOU GO, COW GIRL. IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THE GENDER  REVOLUTION WAS GOING TO START IN  TEXAS, I WOULD HAVE SAID Y'ALL BEST BE JOKING. NOW GET OUT OF HERE WITH YOUR  SALSA.
John: THAT IS HOW THEY TALK. I MEAN, YOU'RE EQUATING THAT  WOMAN AND WENDY DAVIS.
OH, NO. OF COURSE NOT. I MEAN WHAT SHE DID IS MUCH MORE  IMPRESSIVE. WENDY DAVIS STOOD UP FOR A  WOMAN'S RIGHT BUT THE OTHER  WOMAN STOOD UP FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MIX UP ABOUT HOW A  WOMAN'S BODY WORKS. THAT'S USUALLY A MAN'S JOB. THAT IS THE FINAL GLASS CEILING  WE HAD TO BREAK. IT HAPPENED IN THE U.S. HOUSE  LAST WEEK. WATCH.
THE HOUSE HAS PASSEDDED A  SWEEPING ANTIABORTION BILL.
THE REPUBLICANS DID TAKE ONE  P.R. MOVE OF TRYING TO SHINE  THIS THING UP. THEY FOUND A REPUBLICAN WOMAN TO  TAKE THE REINS OF THE BILL,  CONGRESSMAN MARCIA BLACKBURN INSTEAD OF FRANKS.
(SINGING) OH, MAN. MARTHA BLACKBURN IS A ROLE  MODEL. LADIES I'M TAKING CONTROL OF MY  BODY AND ALSO YOURS. HAVING WOMEN IS GOOD FOR THE  WHOLE COUNTRY.
John: HOW? THINK OF HOW MUCH MONEY  YOU'LL SAVE BY PAYING US LESS.
John: THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY  GOOD POINT.
IT'S HAPPENING SO FAST. I'M SORRY. I JUST HAVE TO FILIBUSTER MORE. YOU GUY DON'T HAVE ANY DIAPERS  AROUND HERE, DO YOU.
John: WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR  THIS.
I DON'T NEED THEM. AND WE HAVE ALL THE TIME. I HAVE A DREAM.
John: I DON'T THINK THIS IS A  GOOD IDEA.
I HAVE A DREAM THAT A WOMAN  WILL NOT BE JUDGED ON THE COLOR  OF HER BRA BUT ON THE CONTENT OF HER WOMB. I HAVE A DREAM. THAT ONE DAY A WOMAN WILL  CONTINUE TO MAKE 70% OF WHAT A  MAN MAKES BUT ONLY BECAUSE HER FEMALE BOSS TREAT CHEATED HER  OUT OF IT. ONE DAY WE SHALL HAVE A WOMAN  PRESIDENT WITH AN ALL MALE  CABINET. AND ONE DAY A NATION OF WOMEN  WILL RISE UP AND LIVE OUT THE  TRUE MEANING OF ITS CREED.
John: START TO COMMERCIAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
