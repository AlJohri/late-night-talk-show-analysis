Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST GERARD BUTLER HAS A  NEW FILM "FACING MAVERICKS."  IT'S A FILM FOLLOWING SARAH  PALIN AROUND. (LAUGHTER)  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT LADY? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST  NIGHT'S PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN  BOCA RATON, FLORIDA, WHICH IS  SPANISH FOR "RAT'S MOUTH." (LAUGHTER)  AND YIDDISH FOR "HEAVEN'S  WAITING ROOM."  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  THIS IS THE THIRD AND-- THANK GOD-- FINAL DEBATE BETWEEN  BARACK OBAMA AND MITT ROMNEY. TO TOPIC, FOREIGN POLICY. BAD NEWS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA  BECAUSE --
IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTS  OF THE UNITED STATES, HE'S OUR  WORST AT FOREIGN POLICY.
THIS IS A VERY WEAK  ILL-CONCEIVED FOREIGN POLICY. EVERY PLACE YOU LOOK IS FAILURE.
THE JIMMY CARTER YEARS LOOK  LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS COMPARED  TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
THE PRESIDENT HAS  COMMUNICATED WEAKNESS.
Jon: WEAKNESS IN FOREIGN  POLICY! OBAMA IS WEAKER THAN COOLIDGE IN  FOREIGN POLICY! WEAKER THAN POLK! WEAKER THAN PRESIDENT  FLINCHINGTON J. CRAPHISPANTS. (LAUGHTER)  AS YOU KNOW, THE ONLY PRESIDENT  IN UNITED STATES HISTORY WHO  EVER HAD HIS WALLET STOLEN BY A  BABY. (LAUGHTER)  YOU DON'T HEAR AS MUCH ABOUT OLD  PRESIDENT CRAPHISPANTS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT GIVEN OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY  RECORD, THIS DEBATE IS GOING TO  BE A BLOODBATH.
I CONGRATULATE HIM ON TAKING  OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN. DRONES ARE BEING USED IN DRONE  STRIKES AND I SUPPORT THAT  ENTIRELY. AND FEEL THE PRESIDENT WAS  RIGHT. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE SAME  POINT THE PRESIDENT MADE. I FELT THE SAME AS THE PRESIDENT  DID. I SUPPORTED HIS ACTION THERE. ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO  TO HAVE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I THINK ROMNEY'S  LEANING OBAMA! (LAUGHTER)  APPARENTLY ROMNEY IS ONE OF THIS  YEAR'S COVETED SWING VOTERS. LOOK, HOW CLOSELY DID MITT  ROMNEY ALIGN HIMSELF WITH WHAT  HAD, I GUESS UP UNTIL LAST  NIGHT, BEEN THE WORST FOREIGN POLICY EVER? LISTEN TO THESE GUYS DUET ON  SYRIA.
I BELIEVE THAT ASSAD MUST GO.
ASSAD HAS TO GO.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE OUR  MILITARY INVOLVED IN SYRIA.
FOR US TO GET MORE ENTANGLED  MILITARILY IN SYRIA IS A SERIOUS  STEP.
SO THE RIGHT COURSE FOR US IS  WORKING THROUGH OUR PARTNERS --
-- IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR  PARTNERS --
-- TO IDENTIFY RESPONSIBLE  PARTIES WITHIN SYRIA.
MOBILIZING THE MODERATE  FORCES.
ORGANIZE THEM.
HELPING THE OPERATION  ORGANIZE.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE --
MAKING ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN --
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ARMS --
-- ARMS ?
THE WRONG HANDS.
TO HURT US DOWN THE ROAD. (.
(BOTH TOGETHER)  THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WOW, WHAT THE HELL WAS  THAT? ON FOREIGN POLICY IT APPEARS  THAT ALL THAT'S LEFT FOR THE  PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS THIS ONE  MODEL. I MEAN, AT LEAST WE STILL GET  OUR CHOICE OF COLOR BUT IT'S THE  SAME MODEL! (LAUGHTER)  WHAT THE HELL'S ROMNEY UP TO? THE WHOLE DEBATE WAS A TOUR OF  BIZARRO LAND. HERE'S ROMNEY ON THE AFGHANISTAN  WITHDRAWAL.
WELL, WE'RE GOING TO BE  FINISHED BY 2014 AND WHEN I'M  PRESIDENT WE'LL MAKE SURE WE  BRING OUR TROOPS OUT BY THE END OF 2014.
Jon: 2014 WITHDRAWAL DATE  NO MATTER WHAT! THAT'S BARACK OBAMA'S PLAN! (LAUGHTER)  THE WEIRD PART IS, IT NEVER USED  TO BE ROMNEY'S.
ANNOUNCING A WITHDRAWAL DATE,  THAT WAS WRONG. THE TALIBAN MAY NOT HAVE WATCHES  BUT THEY DO HAVE CALENDARS.
Jon: CALENDARS? I MEANT COLANDERS. THEY HAVE COLANDERS. (LAUGHTER)  AND DID I SAY WITHDRAWAL DATE  WAS WRONG? I MEANT RIGHT! (LAUGHTER)  HOW ABOUT IRAQ?
GOVERNOR ROMNEY, WAS THE WAR  IN IRAQ A GOOD IDEA WORTH THE  COST IN BLOOD AND TREASURE WE  HAVE SPENT?
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION TO  GO INTO IRAQ. I SUPPORTED IT AT THE TIME; I  SUPPORT IT NOW.
Jon: BUT DO YOU SUPPORT IT  --  (LAUGHTER). NOW?
WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER IRAQ. WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER  AFGHANISTAN. THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT COURSE FOR  US.
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S NOT A  FLIP-FLOP SO MUCH AS A  PRINCIPLED RECOGNITION BECAUSE  OF THE IRAQ WAR'S CURRENT  UNPOPULARITY. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW WHAT? IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN THOSE ARE  YESTERDAY'S WARS. IT'S TOMORROW'S WAR THAT COUNTS  AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING GOVERNOR  ROMNEY HAS BEEN VOCIFEROUS ABOUT  LO THESE PAST 18 MONTHS IT IS HIS UNCOMPROMISING BELIEF THAT  IT'S TIME TO RATTLE OUR SABERS  AT IRAN.
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO  SHOULD HAVE INSTEAD COMMUNICATED  TO IRAN THAT WE ARE PREPARED,  THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING MILITARY OPTIONS, THEY'RE NOT JUST ON THE  TABLE, THEY ARE IN OUR HANDS.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE  BUILT CREDIBLE THREAT OF  MILITARY ACTION. WHEN THEY SEE OUR MILITARY  OPTION IN OUR HAND, A POSSIBLE  BLOCKADE OR AERIAL STRIKES THEY  RECOGNIZE WE MEAN BUSINESS.
Jon: WE MEAN BUSINESS  MOTHER (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER)  BLOCKADE! AERIAL STRIKES. PEW! PEW! WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU, IRAN! ALL RIGHT. SO HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO  CONTRAST OBAMA'S APPEASEMENT  THROUGH DIPLOMACY WITH YOUR  FREEDOM THROUGH STRENGTH.
IT'S ALSO ESSENTIAL FOR US TO  UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR MISSION IS  IN IRAN AND THAT IS TO DISSUADE IRAN FROM HAVING A NUCLEAR  WEAPON THROUGH PEACEFUL AND  DIPLOMATIC MEANS. WE WANT A PEACEFUL PLANET. WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TONE  JOY THEIR LIVES AND KNOW THEY'LL  HAVE A BRIGHT AND PROSPEROUS  FUTURE AND NOT BE AT WAR. I WANT TO SEE PEACE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GET A HAIR CUT, HIPPY. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  GOVERNOR ROMNEY APPEARS --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GOVERNOR ROMNEY APPEARS TO HAVE MADE THE CALCULATED DECISION  THAT HIS BELLICOSE AND HAWKISH  PERFORMANCES IN THE REPUBLICAN  PRIMARIES WOULD BE LESS APPRECIATED BY THE NORMALS. BUT HERE'S THE CRAZY PART. AFTER BASICALLY CASTING OFF WHAT  WERE MONTHS AND WEEKS AGO HIS  BEDROCK PRINCIPLES AND BELIEFS  TO COPY OBAMA'S POLICY POSITION IN A TRANSPARENTLY CYNICAL  APPEAL TO UNDECIDED, GUESS WHICH  QUALITY ROMNEY CHOSE TO  HIGHLIGHT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN?
LEADERSHIP. WE SHOULD BE PLAYING THE  LEADERSHIP ROLE. AMERICA MUST LEAD. WE NEED STRONG LEADERSHIP. REAL LEADERSHIP. I'D LIKE TO BE THAT LEADER.
FOLLOW ME! I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND THE  PRESIDENT! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  I'VE GOT TO SAY, BY THE END OF  LAST NIGHT I WAS BEGINNING TO  WORRY WE WERE IN SOME KIND OF "FREAKY FRIDAY" SITUATION WHERE  BARACK OBAMA -- THEY SOMEHOW  PEED IN THE SAME FOUNTAIN AND  SWITCHED BODIES OR JUST --  (LAUGHTER). REMEMBER TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN  ROMNEY WAS THE ONE WHO WAS ALL  CONFIDENT AND STARING DAGGERS AT  OBAMA AND THE PRESIDENT WAS LOOKING AT SOME RAPTUROUS  DREAMLAND THAT ONLY HE COULD  SEE? (LAUGHTER)  WELL, LAST NIGHT IT WAS OBAMA  DELIVERING THE DEATH STARE WHILE  ROMNEY SUDDENLY FOUND SOMETHING ON HIS PODIUM INCREDIBLY  FASCINATING. (LAUGHTER)  AND THAT'S NOT ALL. OBAMA WHO, AS WE ALL REMEMBER,  WAS (BLEEP)ING ASLEEP DURING THE  FIRST DEBATE WAS HITTING ROMNEY  LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE ZINGERS.
WELL, GOVERNOR ROMNEY IS  RIGHT, YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH  JOBS BEING SHIPPED OVERSEAS  BECAUSE YOU INVESTED IN COMPANIES THAT WERE SHIPPING  JOBS OVERSEAS.
Jon: BOOM!
YOU MENTIONED THE NAVY, FOR  EXAMPLE, AND THAT WE HAVE FEWER  SHIPS THAN WE DID IN 1916. WELL, GOVERNOR, WE ALSO HAVE  FEWER HORSES AND BAYONETS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: BAM!
THE BIGGEST GEOPOLITICAL  THREAT FACING AMERICA YOU SAID  RUSSIA. NOT AL QAEDA, YOU SAID RUSSIA. AND THE 1980s ARE CALLING TO  ASK FOR THEIR FOREIGN POLICY  BACK. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELL, THAT WAS A  LITTLE HACKIE. I MEAN THAT WAS -- THAT WAS A IT  WILL ROASTY. I WOULDN'T (BLEEP) YOUR FOREIGN  POLICY WITH MARGARET THATCHER'S  (BLEEP), COME ON! HICKORY DICKORY DOCK, YOUR  GEOPOLITICAL UNDERSTANDING CAN  SUCK MY --  (LAUGHTER)  SORRY. THAT'S -- NO, PLEASE DON'T  BECAUSE THEN I'LL DO IT AGAIN  SOME NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  SO THE PRESIDENT HAD A GOOD  NIGHT. MUST HAVE FELT PRETTY CONFIDENT  BECAUSE HE WAS LETTING HIS  PROFESSOR OR Y'ALL SIDE SHINE  THROUGH. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO ONE  COUNTRY.
WE'VE CREATED PARTNERSHIPS  THROUGHOUT THE REGION TO DEAL  WITH EXTREMISM. IN SOMALIA, IN YEMEN, IN  PAKISTAN.
Jon: WHAT? REALLY? (LAUGHTER)  PAH-KEE-STAHN? REALLY? SUDDENLY YOU'RE A GUY WHO'S  DESPERATE TO PROVE YOU ONCE  ROOMED WITH A FOREIGN EXCHANGE  STUDENT? (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, THIS IS AMERICA, WE DON'T  USE THE PRONUNCIATION LOCALLY. WE DON'T SAY MAY-HEE-CO OR  FRAHNCE. MEXICO, FRANCE. PAKISTAN. (LAUGHTER)  ALL IN ALL LAST NIGHT MADE A  FINE CONCLUSION, THOUGH, TO THE  ILOGY OF DEBATES BETWEEN THETR TWO CANDIDATES EAGER ACCEPTANCE  OF REMOTE CONTROLLED HELLFIRE  DRONES TO ACHIEVE THAT END. WE LEARNED MITT ROMNEY HAS  BASICALLY COME AROUND TO BARACK  OBAMA'S POSITION ON FOREIGN  POLICY AND BARACK OBAMA'S COME AROUND TO THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY ON  AGGRESSION OVERSEAS BUT DON'T  WORRY, PEOPLE.
THE FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE OF  THE THREE DEBATES I ASSUME THIS  WILL BE THE LEAST WATCHED OF THE  THREE.
SO MANY VOTERS IN RECENT  POLLS HAVE SAID THEY DON'T CARE  ANYTHING ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY.
YES OR NO, THIS DEBATE  MATTER?
I DON'T THINK SO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND AP
