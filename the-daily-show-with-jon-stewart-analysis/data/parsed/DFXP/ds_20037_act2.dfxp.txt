Jon: WELCOME BACK! SO, SWEDEN. SWEDEN RECENTLY ELECTED A NEW PRIME MINISTER, STEFAN LOFVEN. MR. LOFVEN AGREED TO SIT DOWN WITH US BECAUSE APPARENTLY RUNNING A COUNTRY GIVES YOU A LOT OF FREE TIME. JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
Jon: FOR YEARS SWEDEN HAS ENJOYED A STERLING REPUTATION AS A PROSPEROUS NATION TOPPING THE WORLD IN EVERY METRIC POSSIBLE FROM HEALTHCARE TO INCOME TO ABBA COVER BANDS. I SAT DOWN WITH STEFAN LOFVEN, NEWLY ELECTED AS PRIME MINISTER IN OCTOBER TO FIND OUT THEIR SECRET. WELCOME, MR. PRIME MINISTER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: AS A TOKEN OF APPRECIATION, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU ONE OF YOUR TRADITIONAL ARMY KNIVES.
OH, THERE WE GO. THIS IS VERY COMMON.
YES.
THAT THE AMERICANS MIX SWEDEN WITH SWITZERLAND.
I'M SORRY. THAT'S EMBARRASSING.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE.
SHOULD I EVEN OFFER YOU THE TRADITIONAL SWEDISH FISH TACOS?
IT'S VERY GENEROUS AND KIND OF YOU, BUT IT'S NOT SWEDISH.
NOT SWEDISH.
UNFORTUNATELY NOT.
BUT I WASN'T HERE FOR A DEBATE ON SWEDE-MEX CUISINE, OUR COUNTRY NEEDED HELP DEALING WITH OUR POLITICAL GRIDLOCK AND PARTISAN ANGER.
BILLS THAT COME OUT HERE ALL THE GODDAMN TIME. COME OUT HERE THE LAS (BLEEP) IT.
WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE HERE WITH OUR TWO-PARTY SYSTEM. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS ANY BILLS. HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO PULL YOUR TWO PARTIES TOGETHER?
IN THE PARLIAMENT WE HAVE EIGHT, EIGHT PARTIES.
YOU HAVE EIGHT PARTIES?
RIGHT.
ARE YOU DOING, IS THAT A METRIC NUMBER?
METRIC NUMBER, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. WE HAVE EIGHT PARTIES AND IT  WORKS.
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH EIGHT PARTIES?
WELL, IT TAKES NEGOTIATIONS OF COURSE. YOU KEEP CONTACT WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTCY, MEETINGS WITH COMPANIES, MEETINGS WITH TRADE UNIONS.
WHEN DO YOU FIND TIME TO CAMPAIGN?
I JUST GOT INTO GOVERNMENT, I STARTED WORK NOW.
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO GOVERN AFTER REELECTION.
NO, I CHOOSE ANOTHER STRATEGY AND WE NEED TO ACT RIGHT NOW, BETTER FUTURE FOR THE CHILDREN.
Jon: CAN CHILDREN VOTE IN YOUR COUNTRY?
NO, YOU HAVE TO BE 18 YEARS.
OKAY, THEN LEAVE THEM OUT OF THIS.
NO.
YES.
NO.
LOOK, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN PRIME MINISTER OF A COUNTRY TWO MORE MONTHS THAN I HAVE SO HEAR ME OUT.  OKAY, IF HE INSISTED ON GOVERNING, WHAT BRILLIANT POLICIES WAS HE COOKING UP?
SO, WE'RE RAISING TAXES.
YOU'RE RAISING TAXES?
RIGHT. WE NEED A WELFARE SYSTEM THAT'S THERE FOR EVERYBODY WHEN YOU NEED IT.
CAREFUL, SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE SOCIALISM.
IF YOU GET UNEMPLOYED --
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
IF YOU NEED A PROPER TRAINING, WE'LL ASSIST YOU WITH THAT.
DO YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE OVER AT FALLON?
NO. I DON'T.
WELL THEN HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP ME GET A JOB?
I GUESS PERHAPS IT'S TIME FOR CAN YOU TO CHANGE JOBS TOTALLY PERHAPS INTO A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SECTOR.
WHAT ARE YOU -- HAVE YOU HEARD SOMETHING?
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
WAS IT THE SWEDISH TACO JOKE? I KNOW IT WAS A HACK JOKE.
I THINK YOU CAN IMPROVE. I THINK YOU CAN IMPROVE, ACTUALLY.
MAYBE THERE WAS A SWEDISH WAY LOVEN COULD SHOW ME HOW TO ASSEMBLE A FUNCTIONAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND FURNISH MY BEDROOM AT THE SAME TIME. LET'S SAY THIS IS TEA PARTY?
TEA PARTY.
DO YOU THINK CLIMATE CHANGE COULD PUT THESE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS TOGETHER WITH THE GREEN PARTY? I MEAN, THAT LOOKS LIKE IT --
COULD BE. COULD BE.
DOES HEALTHCARE GO WITH SOCCER MOMS?
I GUESS SO.
AND JUST LIKE THAT, WE'D CREATED A NEW FUNCTIONAL AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A BED.
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW IS BETTER THAN THIS.
YEAH. I WAS INSPIRED BY HOW LOFVEN HELD HIS GOVERNMENT TOGETHER AND STUCK TO HIS PRINCIPLES SO I HONORED HIM WITH A KEY TO THE PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY IKEA.
OH GREAT, GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
I'M HONORED.
THEN SEVEN DAYS LATER THIS HAPPENED.
ALRIGHT, LET'S TAKE YOU TO NEWS OUT OF SWEDEN, POLITICIANS THERE HAVE REJECTED THE MINORITY GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL, AND THAT COULD LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE RULING LEFT-LEANING COALITION.
(BLEEP) IT. FROM NOW ON, I'M SHOPPING AT CRATE AND BARREL.
THANK YOU, JORDAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
