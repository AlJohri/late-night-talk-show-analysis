Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, RETIRED FOUR-STAR GENERAL HAS SERVED AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF CENTCOM, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED: HOW AMERICA CAN WIN OR LOSE OFF THE BATTLEFIELD." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, GENERAL TONY ZINNI! GENERAL! HOW ARE YOU, SIR? THANKS FOR BEING HERE. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SIR, I AM STUNNED. THE BOOK IS CALLED "BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED." HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN THAT THE UNITED STATES WOULD FIND ITSELF IN ARMED CONFLICT? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, IT WAS NOT HARD, SINCE WE HAVE BEEN AT IT FOR QUITE A BIT.
Jon: YES, SIR.
AND I THINK THAT IN THE LAST 25 YEARS EVER SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR, WE'VE NEVER FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS WORLD IS ALL ABOUT AND WHAT OUR PLACE AND ROLE IS IN IT, AS I SAY IN THE BOOK. AND WE KEEP STUMBLING THROUGH AND STUMBLING INTO MANY OF THESE ARMED CONFLICTS AND ACTUALLY MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE. I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE INHERITED TODAY IS LARGELY BECAUSE WE INTERVENED IN PLACES WITHOUT A STRATEGY AND A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO IF WE NEEDED TO DO ANYTHING.
Jon: SO IN SOME RESPECTS, BY DESTABILIZING THE MIDDLE EAST THROUGH OUR INTERVENTIONS, WE HAVE DESTABILIZED IT?
YES. (LAUGHTER) MASTERFULLY. I THINK WHEN WE WENT INTO IRAQ, IT WAS AN UNNECESSARY WAR. WRONG WAR, WRONG PLACE. WRONG TIME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK OUR BUSINESS WAS WITH AL QAEDA IN AFGHANISTAN. WE GOT DISTRACTED, LET AL QAEDA ESCAPE. WE TRIED TO RENT AN ARMY IN AFGHANISTAN, NORTHERN ALLIANCE, WHICH WAS TERRIBLE. WE'RE TRYING THE SAME THING NOW WITH A RENTED ARMY WITH KURDS AND IRAQIS AND OTHERS...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO DO WELL EITHER.
Jon: AND IN SYRIA, AS WELL THEY'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO TRAIN THE REBEL GROUPS THAT ARE MORE MODERATE IN SYRIA BECAUSE THEY WILL BE, I GUESS, OUR BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO TAKE OUT I.S.I.S.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK. I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. WE'RE GOING TO SEND WEAPONS IN, NOT SURE WHO IS GOING TO GET THEM. WE HAVEN'T VETTED THEM. WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THEM THROUGH. THEY HAVE ANOTHER WAR ON THEIR HANDS FIGHTING ASSAD'S FORCES. WE'RE BETTING THAT THEY WILL TAKE OUT I.S.I.S. OR TRY OR HELP TAKE IT OUT. I DON'T THINK THEY WILL BE CAPABLE, MAYBE NOT EVEN WILLING IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
Jon: WHAT IF WE TURNED AROUND AND SHUT OUR EYES? (CHUCKLE)
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THIS GROUP COMMITTED GENOCIDE.
Jon: SURE.
THIS GROUP HAS BEHEADED, CRUCIFIED. THIS GROUP HAS TAKEN 13, 14-YEAR OLD GIRLS, AND GAVE THEM TO THEIR FIGHTERS.
Jon: RIGHT.
I THINK THERE'S A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY HERE. I MEAN, I COULD TELL YOU...
Jon: BUT ASSAD HAS DONE, YOU KNOW ASSAD HAS BOMBED INDISCRIMINATELY HIS OWN PEOPLE.
YES.
Jon: YOU KNOW, AT WHAT POINT DO WE DECIDE WHAT IS THE MORAL IMPERATIVE? BECAUSE THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF PLACES IN THIS WORLD WHERE ATROCITIES ARE COMMITTED EVERY DAY.
YES, AND WE CAN'T BE THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN, THAT'S USUALLY THE FOLLOW ON. BUT IN PLACES WHERE IT'S SO EGREGIOUS, WHERE IT IS SO TERRIBLE, SO BAD, WHEN YOU SEE LIKE THE YAZIDIS AND THE CHALDEANS AND OTHERS AND THE INTENT IS TO WIPE THEM OUT.
Jon: YES.
EVERY LAST MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD, AND WHEN YOU SEE THE HORRIFIC THINGS THEY PUT ON VIDEO, I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE THINGS LIKE THIS GO ON, BUT I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION, A MORAL OBLIGATION AS THE GREATEST POWER ON EARTH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, AS A MILITARY PERSON.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S TOUGH FOR ME TO STAND BY AND SEE THAT.
Jon: IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION STRONGER BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER BECAUSE, IN MANY WAYS, WE CREATED THIS NIGHTMARE? OR CREATED SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THAT ALLOWED THIS NIGHTMARE TO FLOURISH? IS THAT WHY THE MORAL IMPERATIVE IS STRONGER HERE THAN IT MIGHT BE IN ANOTHER AREA?
I THINK IT'S NOT ONLY THAT. THERE'S A SENSE OF GUILT AND RESPONSIBILITY, BUT I THINK THERE'S A SENSE OF GUILT THAT WE LET THE HOLOCAUST GO ON, OR RWANDA AND BARUNDI GO ON WITHOUT DOING NOTHING, AND EVEN CAMBODIA WITH THE KHMER ROUGE, SO THAT GUILT WORKS BOTH WAYS. WHERE WE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IT, THERE ARE TIMES IN OUR HISTORY WHERE WE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY WHERE I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT FOR AMERICA TO DO.
Jon: RIGHT, IN THIS SITUATION. SO, ALL RIGHT, SO HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO. WE'LL COME BACK. AND WE'LL TALK THEN ABOUT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO NOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY AND HOW NOT TO REPEAT THE MISTAKES THAT WE'VE MADE IN THESE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, AND YOU RAN THEM BACK FROM THE HOLOCAUST TO SAIGON TO UP TO PRESENT DAY AND HOW WE TRY NOT TO REPEAT THAT. MORE WITH GENERAL TONY ZINNI RIGHT AFTER THIS.
