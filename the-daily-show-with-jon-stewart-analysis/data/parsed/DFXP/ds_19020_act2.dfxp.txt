[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE TURN NOW TO A BREAKING SCANDAL OUT OF WASHINGTON, D.C.
HE'S ONE OF TEA PARTIES BIGGER STARS BUT NOW SENATOR RAND PAUL STANDS ACCUSED OF DOING SOMETHING OUR THIRD GRADE TEACHERS WOULD NAIL US FOR.
Jon: OH, SNAP! DID HE USE A MAGIC MARKER TO CHANGE CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG TO CLIFFORD THE BIG RED (bleep). FOR THE RECORD MISS FERGUSON THAT CRUSHED. SORRY WHAT DID HE DO?
PLAGIARISM.
HE APPARENTLY LIFTED SEVERAL LINES OF HIS SPEAK DIRECTLY FROM WIKIPEDIA.
IN THE MOVIE GATTACA IN THE TOO DISTANT FUTURE EUGENICS IS COMMON -- VINCENT FREEMAN IS CONCEIVED AND BORN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY WITHOUT THE AID OF GENETIC SCREENING.
Jon: I'M GOING TO PRETEND HERE THAT THE THING WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT SUIS THAT RAND PAUL IS COPYING FROM WIKIPEDIA AND NOT THAT HE'S WARNING AMERICANS ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT BY REFERENCING AN ETHAN HAWKE MOVIE. YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS A PLACE WHERE ROOKIE COPS HAVE BETTERCE WHERE TRAINING. AND ONE DAY A YEAR CRIME IS LEGAL AND WHERE -- UM -- [LAUGHTER] DAYS ARE BROKEN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND A WORLD -- [LAUGHTER] (bleep). WHERE THE FINEST THINGS COME FROM BROOKLYN AND I HAVE NO (bleep) IDEA. I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER -- HOW MANY OF THESE -- ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF MOVIES I HAVEN'T SEEN YET. AS FAR AS PLAGIARISM GOES AND I'M SURE THERE'S A REASONABLE EXPLANATION.
I THINK THE SPOKEN WORD SHOULDN'T BE HELD TO THE SAME SORT OF STANDARD THAT YOU HAVE IF YOU ARE GIVING A SCIENTIFIC PAPER. 98% OF MY SPEECHES ARE EXTEMPORANEOUS.
Jon: THAT MEANS ONLY 2% OF HIS SPEECHES ARE PLAGIARIZED AND MOST OF THOSE ARE JUST TAYLOR SWIFT LYRICS SO REALLY -- [LAUGHTER] THE PROBLEM IS IT DOESN'T STOP WITH SPEECHES.
THREE PAGES OF RAND PAUL'S LATEST BOOK WERE DIRECTLY LIFTED FROM CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK DOCUMENTS. ANOTHER ENTIRE SECTION OF THE SAME BOOK WAS LIFTED NEARLY WORD FOR WORD FROM A FORBES ARTICLE.
A SEPTEMBER OP ED WRITTEN BY PAUL APPEARS TO BE LIFTED FROM AN ARTICLE THAT APPEARED IN "THE WEEK."
Jon: SOME ARE RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS MEMOIR OF LIFE AS A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN IN THE SEGREGATED SOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S BECOMING INCREASELY CLEAR THAT MR. PAUL HAS STOLEN HIS HAIRCUT FROM  80'S ICON PATRICK DUFFY. YOU'RE WELCOME. AT LEAST THE RAND MAN IS HANDLING THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE APPROPRIATE MANNER.
I THINK I'M BEING UNFAIRLY TARGETED BY A BUNCH OF HACKS AND HATERS.
THE SENATOR PAUL TOLD THE TIMES TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH PEOPLE CAN THINK WHAT THEY WANT. I CAN GO BACK TO BEING A DOCTOR ANY TIME. IF THEY ARE TIRED OF ME I'LL GO BACK TO BE A DOCTOR AND I'LL BE PERFECTLY CONTENT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL START MY OWN GOVERNMENT WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO COPY OFF OTHER PEOPLE. I'LL START MY OWN COUNTRY. I'LL CALL IT BELGIUM. I CAME UP WITH THAT NAME, BELGIUM. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK.
