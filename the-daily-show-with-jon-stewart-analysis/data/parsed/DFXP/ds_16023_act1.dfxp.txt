COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. DOING THE DOUGIE. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS BRIAN WILLIAMS. REALLY? AGAIN? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GUESS IT'S ONLY FIVE MINUTES, IT WILL BE FINE. [LAUGHTER] EVERY NIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF A ROUTINE. I DRIVE HOME, KICK BACK, TURN ON THE JEOPARDY AND SIT AND COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW MUCH LONGER  IS IT BEFORE ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT COMES ON. USUALLY ABOUT A HALF HOUR. LAST NIGHT I TURN IT OP AND I CAN'T BELIEVE, THEY ARE LETTING COMPUTERS PLAY JEOPARDY NOW. APPARENTLY THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF QUALIFIED HUMAN CONTESTANTS FOR JEOPARDY AND THE COMPUTER IS  CRUSHING IT.
WHAT IS LEPROSY.
WHO IS SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN, WHO IS THE CHURCH LADY? WHO IS ISAAC NEWTON, WHAT IS GUITAR? WHAT IS THE -- WHAT IS --
YOU ARE RIGHT AND WITH THAT YOU MOVE TO $36,681. A BIG, BIG LEAD.
HE WON $36,000. OH, YEAH, SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET REPWAOTD TONIGHT OR WHATEVER IT IS COMPUTERS DO WHEN THEY WIN  A LOT OF MONEY. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY THAT GUY IS WATSON, THE COMPUTER THERE IS THE LATEST IN A LONGLINE OF SUPERCOMPUTERS  INVENTED TO MAKE HUMANS STOP TAKE UP HOBBIES. YOU KNOW WHAT, COMPUTERS? YOU WANT TO THROW DOWN? YOU WANT TO HAVE A GO? IS THAT IT? YOU BESTED US AT CHESS AND WIDELY SYNDICATED QUIZ SHOWS. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, ISN'T IT A ONE-WAY STREET. YOU THINK YOU CAN BE A BETTER US? MAYBE WE CAN BE A BETTER YOU? MUST BE NICE TO BEAT US AT OUR JOBS, TAKE OUR GAMES. WHENEVER IS SOMETHING TO HEAVY FOR YOU, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T  KNOW A THING DDOOOOOOO, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. [LAUGHTER] DON'T ASK ME. YEAH, MUST BE NICE. YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT. YOU ARE A PERSON. I'M A COMPUTER, HOW HARD CAN IT BE? I GOT GAMES. I CAN PLAY GAMES. WHERE IS MY BOWL OF BIRDS? HERE IS MY BIRD. YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME? HUH? THESE ARE BIRDS FROM MY OWN -- THESE ARE MY OWN BIRDS. I'VE BEEN SWINGING BIRDS INTO BUILDINGS SINCE WHERE YOU WERE READING PUNCH CARDS AT M.I. T. MEANWHILE, BACK IN WASHINGTON PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASED HIS BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012. APPARENTLY IN PHONEBOOK FORM. [LAUGHTER] THE BUDGET CALL TOWARDS $3.7 TRILLION IN SPENDING WHICH IS, I KNOW, A DIFFICULT NUMBER TO WRAP  YOUR HEADS AROUND. PERHAPS THIS DEMONSTRATION WILL IN NO WAY CLARIFY THINGS FOR YOU.
WE GOT THE PENNIES AND STACKED THEM UNTIL WE GOT THIS BUDGET. EACH ONE STACK OF THESE FIVE PENNIES REPRESENTS $2 BILLION.
Jon: THAT DOESN'T HELP US IN ANYWAY. [LAUGHTER] LET ME DO A QUICK IMPRESSION OF YOU OF AN EMPLOYEE AT ABC WORLD NEWS. I WENT TO COLOMBIA UNIVERSITY -- COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND NOW I'M  STACKING PENNIES PENNIES TO MAKE A PIE CHART. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. LET'S GET TO THE BUDGET. $3.7 BILLION. THE TRICK IS TO GET IT TO VASTLY INCREASE THE DEFICIT WHILE GIVING AMERICANS THE SHOTY  DEMOCRACY WE EXPECT OR ARE AT LEAST NUMB TO.
SOME OF THE SAVINGS COME THROUGH LESS WASTE AND MORE EFFICIENCY. WE'LL SPEND BILLIONS OF GETTING RID OF 14,000 OFFICE BUILDINGS, LOTS AND GOVERNMENT-OWNED PROPERTIES WE NO LONGER NEED.
Jon: FROM NOW ON WHEN WE BUY OFFICE SUPPLIES WE'LL JOIN UP WITH CANADA AND MEXICO TO  LOOK FOR DEALS ON GROUPON. [LAUGHTER] THE BUDGET WOULD CUT SUCH ENTITLEMENT STAPLES AS THE HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE AND PELL GRANTS. MAYBE REPUBLICANS HAVE A STRONGER PLAN FOR GETTING THE DEFICIT UNDER CONTROL.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO TAKE OUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
THE ELIMINATION OFMEN CORPS, FOR EXAMPLE.
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A NEW TARGET PBS AND NPR.
Jon: AT LEAST WE AGREE THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS SPHES TO EFFECT PROGRAMS OF PEOPLE  THAT VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS. OBAMA WOULD SAVE $1.1 TRILLION. JEFF SESSIONS, RANKING REPUBLICAN ON THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH BEST KNOWN  FOR HIS 1996 COLLABORATION WITH BOB DYLAN. [LAUGHTER] IT WILL BRING BACK (bleep) PICTURE. [LAUGHTER] THAT GUY HAS GOT TO BE PLEASED WITH THE CUTS.
WHEN YOU HEAR THE $1.1 TRILLION IN SAVINGS OVER TEN YEARS, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? IS THAT A GOOD START, SENATOR?
NO, IT'S NOT. I EXPECT ACCORDING TO PROJECTIONS $12 TRILLION TO $14 TRILLION IN NEW ADDED DURING THAT TIME. SO A $1 TRILLION REDUCTION IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DOES NOT GET US OFF TO THE RIGHT COURSE.
Jon: WOW HE SAID THE TRILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS IS INSIGNIFICANT. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PLAN TO SAVE THE IDENTICAL AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER THE SAME TIME.
$100 BILLION MEANS OVER TEN YEARS YOU WOULD HAVE A $1 TRILLION SAVINGS. THIS IS THE WAY YOU GET THE BUDGET BALANCED:  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SERIOUSLY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO BUY A FORD? IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. IT'S A PIECE OF (bleep). WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS BUY ONE OF I HAD FORD'S. [LAUGHTER] I CAN'T BELIEVE DYLAN DID AN ALBUM WITH THAT GUY. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S CLEAR THAT NONE OF YOU GUYS, REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, HAVE TAKEN THIS SERIOUS. I'M GOING TO DO IT MYSELF. I'M GOING CHARLES TKPWROEDEN AND DAVE ON YOUR ASS AND THAT IS MY LAST REFERENCE TONIGHT. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. HOW BIG IS THE BUDGET?
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR CAME IN AT MORE THAN $3.7 TRILLION.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT $3.7 TRILLION. WHAT IS THE DEFICIT?
THE DEFICIT $1.1 TRILLION.
Jon: OKAY $1.1 -- YOU KNOW WHAT, HOLD ON? YEAH, THAT'S BETTER. SOMETIMES THEY NEED TO WARM UP. [LAUGHTER] WE'VE GOT $3.7 TRILLION UP FOR GRABS. 88% OF THE BUDGET IS NOT EFFECTED BY THESE CUTS. THEY ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON THE CUTS -- FOCUSING THE CUTS ON 12% OF THE BUDGET.
Jon: WE CAN ONLY CUT FROM 12% OF THE BUDGET. $12% IS $440 BILLION. HERE IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO GET $1.1 TRILLION OF SPENDING CUTS OUT OF $440 BILLION. [LAUGHTER] SO I'M JUST GOING TO VERY QUICKLY -- WATSON? WATSON? MOTHER (bleep)!
