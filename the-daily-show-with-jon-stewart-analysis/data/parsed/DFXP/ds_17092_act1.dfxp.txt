YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT MITT ROMNEY IS  GOING TO GET TO PICK FROM I THINK A LOT OF THEM, SENATOR ROB PORTMAN WOULD BE  PHENOMENAL CHOICE FOR VICE PRESIDENT.
Jon: THAT DOES T THAT IS ALL RIGHT. MARCO RUBBIO SAYS ROB PORTMAN IS YOUR GUY. I DON'T FLOW WHO THAT IS. (LAUGHTER)
LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT.
ROMNEY PORTMAN.
I THINK RUBIO HAS A BETTER RING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHY DOES BEING ROMNEY'S VICE PRESIDENT NOW SEEMS LIKE A DARE NOBODY  WANTS TO TAKE. EAT A PLATE OF MY OWN  [BLEEP] BLOOEP.
NO NO YOU EAT IT. HERE COMES THE PEER PRESSURE.
I THINK MARCO WOULD BE AMONG MANY GREAT CANDIDATE FORCE VICE PRESIDENT. I THINK MARCO'S PROBABLY THE BEST.
Jon: RUBIO PASSES TO PORTMAN, PORTMAN BACK TO RUBIO, BUSH ALSO PACKS BACK  TO RUBIO, RUBIO IN THE LANE HE IS DRIVING, HE IS STANDING FLEX TO THE BASKET AND --
THAT IS VERY NICE OF JEB, I HOPE HE'LL SAY YES IF THE FUTURE PRESIDENT ROMNEY ASKS HIM.
I THINK HE WOULD BE A FANTASTIC VICE PRESIDENT.
Jon: PASSES BACK TO BUSH! DOESN'T ANYBODY WANT THE ROCK IN CRUNCH TIME.
IF YOUR CELL PHONE RANG BECAUSE MITT ROMNEY HAS YOUR NUMBER AND SAID HERMAN, I  NEED YOUR HELP.
I WOULD SAY LET'S TALK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HERMAN CAIN, WITH THE ALLEY-OOP, SLAM-DUNK.
IT'S NOT A SLAM-DUNK.
Jon: WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I MISS THAT GUY. THAT'S WHY WE RECENTLY SENT JOHN OLIVER TO VISIT 4I78 AND GO INSIDE HERMAN'S HEAD. CAIN. WELCOME TO INSIDE THE POLITICAL CURTAIN. I'M PROUD TO WELCOME MR. HERMAN CAIN. (APPLAUSE) MAY 21st, 2011, CENTENNIAL OLYMPIC PARK IN ATLANTA, ARE YOU ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE YOUR  CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, A SOMBER HUMBLING MOMENT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
LOVE Y'ALL! MY, MY, MY! LOVIA! AH, SCHUKY DUCKY IS THE MAN TODAY.
WHAT THOUGHTS WERE GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND AT THAT TIME? ANY?
AH SCHUKY DUCKY WAS A WAY FOR ME TO SAY I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE, AND I AM HAPPY  THAT YOU ARE HAPPY THAT I'M HERE.
WHY NOT JUST SAY THAT? (LAUGHTER)
THAT WOULD BE TOO FORMAL.
SO IT WAS TOO FORMAL FOR A SPEECH IN WHICH YOU ARE ANNOUNCING YOU ARE RUNNING  FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAJD.
YES, YES. ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY I DID NOT HAVE A SCRIPT.
WHY WRITE A SPEECH WHEN YOU CAN JUST SAY THE FIRST THING THAT COMES INTO YOUR HEAD. (LAUGHTER)
THAT IS TRUE. INFORMALITY, I FIND, CONNECTS MUCH MORE WITH PEOPLE THAN FORMALITY.
HERMAN CAIN SHOWED US THAT IMPRO I HAVIZATION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL CAN LEAD  TO SOME MEMORABLE MOMENTS.
WHEN THEY ASKED ME WHO IS THE OF THE UBEKBEKBEKI STANOZOLOL I'M GOING TO SAY  KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU KNOW. THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN KNOW THE HEAD OF STATE FOR ALL OF THE NEARLY 200 NATIONS ON THE PLANET.
IT CAN'T BE DONE.
NO.
NO HUMAN COULD REMEMBER.
YOU POSSIBLY COULD BUT YOU WOULD SPEND ALL OF YOUR TIME TRYING TO REMEMBER WHO  THE HEAD OF UZBEK STAN.
I HAVE A QUESTION, I HOPE YOU DON'T DISAPPOINT. WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF UZBEKISTAN? (LAUGHTER)
THE PRESIDENT OF UZBEKISTAN UZBEKISTAN--  (LAUGHTER) YOU DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THEM  AND HAVE NOT FOUND OUT SINCE.
I DID GO AND LOOK IT UP. AND AT ONE POINT I KNEW HIS NAME. (LAUGHTER) BUT SINCE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I USE EVERY DAY, IT'S GONE AGAIN AND THEN --
YOU AGREED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ON LIBYA OR NOT?
OKAY, LIBYA, PRESIDENT OBAMA SUPPORTED ITS UPRISING, CORRECT? JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING BEFORE I AM SAYING YES I  AGREE OR NO, I DIDN'T AGREE.
THAT WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.
WAS IT?
YES.
THAT'S RIGHT T WAS.
IT WAS AN AWKWARD MOMENT.
EXTREMELY AWKWARD.
AND I ADMIT.
YOU BELIEVEABLY AWKWARD.
YES.
BESIDES HERMAN CAIN WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE FICTIONAL PRESIDENT?
FAVORITE FICTIONAL PRESIDENT.
OF THE MOVIES, OF TELEVISION.
THERE ARE NO FICTIONAL PRESIDENTS.
YOU MEAN MY FAVORITE PRESIDENT THAT WAS PORTRAYED IN A MOVIE? IS THAT WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?
WE'RE BACK INTO THAT LIBYA SITUATION AGAIN. AND THIS QUESTION IF IT'S POSSIBLE IS EVEN EASIER THAN THAT ONE.
YOU SHOULD NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS TOO QUICKLY, IF YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU  COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.
IF WILL YOU HUMOR ME, LET US END OUR JOURNEY TONIGHT WITH A ROLE PLAY EXPLORING  WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. YOU ARE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RERT IS BEING ATTACKED BY ALIENS. YOU ARE STANDING ON THE SMOLTEDERING REMAINS OF WHAT USED TO BE THE OVAL OFFICE. YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO ADDRESS THE EARTH'S INHABITANT ITS, TO INSPIRE  THEM TO RISE UP AND RAPEL THEIR ALIEN IN-- INVADERS, LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA AND ACTION.
CITIZENS OF EARTH, IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT BUILT THIS PLANITY. IT IS THAT SAME SPIRIT OF HUMAN NATURE WILL ALLOW US TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST UNKNOWN ENEMIES. IT IS THAT SAME SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO DESTROY THE ALIENS. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
