FEBRUARY 3, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. ADMIRAL MICHAEL MULL SEASON HERE. WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE HIM BACK. I ALWAYS LOVE TALKING WITH HIM. WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
YO, YO, YO, WHAT'S UP, SON? YO, WHAT'S UP? I FOUND THE MAGIC SKULL, WE CAN FINALLY SWITCH BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL BODIES, YO. (LAUGHTER)
I DON'T KNOW, BIEBER, I KIND OF LIKE THE BODY OF YOURS.
WELL I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS ONE, YO, IT'S LIKE LIVING IN A HAUNTED HOUSE. (LAUGHTER) (CREEKING) JUST TOUCH THE SKULL, MAN, PLEASE! I NEED MY BODY BACK!
FINE, BUT, UM, CAN'T I JUST DO SOMETHING ONE LAST TIME?
OH, COME ON, MAN!
THE HAIR! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S JUST SO... JUST SO NATURAL. JUST SO PURE.
COME ON! JUST TOUCH THE SKULL, MAN! READY?
YEAH, I'M READY.
Jon: YEAH, ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. JUSTIN BIEBER, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH, AND HOPE YOU DON'T MIND A TATTOO THAT I LEFT ON YOUR BODY. SUCKER!
Jon: WHAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DID HE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT A TATTOO HE GOT ME? WHY IS MY ASS SORE? (LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT THE... (LAUGHTER) HASHTAG NEVER SAY NEVER! BIEBER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, YOU SHOULD GO SEE THE MOVIE, IT'S QUITE GOOD. NOT THAT I'M THE TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC. (LAUGHTER) EVEN THOUGH INSIDE I AM A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL. (AUDIENCE MEMBER WHISTLES) (LAUGHTER) WARM. IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE KEITH OLBERMANN AND MSNBC PARTED WAYS LEAVING AN OBER MAN-SHAPED  HOLE IN OUR NATIONAL DISCOURSE. WHO ON THEIR NETWORK WILL STEP INTO THE BREACH? WE FIND OUT IN OUR NEW SEGMENT "OLBERTUNITY KNOCKS."
HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY, SIR?
Jon: THE MOST OFTEN CONTENDER RACHEL MAD DOE. PASSIONATE, LIBERAL. CHECK. GLASSES. CHECK. RAILS MERCILESSLY AGAINST ALL HER OPPOSE HER VIEW POINT.
RICHARD COHEN AUTHOR OF THE BOOK "COMING OUT STRAIGHT, UNDERSTANDING AND HEALING HOMOSEXUALITY." MR. COHEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH  FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME RACHEL.
Jon: WHAT WAS THAT? (LAUGHTER) WHAT PART OF YOU DISAGREE WITH THIS PERSON DON'T YOU GET? WATCH AND LEARN, MADDOW.
THE LEADING TERRORIST GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
KARL ROVE IS AN IDIOT. A MONKEY POSING AS A NEWSCASTER. THE TOTAL MINDLESS OR INLY BANKRUPT KNEE JERK HATRED WITHOUT WHICH MICHELLE MALKIN  WOULD BE A BIG BASHED UP BAG OF MEAT WITH LIPSTICK ON IT. (AUDIENCE REACTS) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF! (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, SHE CAN'T DO IT. ANYBODY ELSE GONNA STEP UP?
I HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT SHE HAS ZOMBIE-LIKE QUALITIES. I CALL HEAR BALLOON HEAD FOR A REASON. I THINK SHE'S A BALLOON HEAD. YOU HAVE TO USE THE WORD "BALLOON HEAD." BALLOON HEAD. BALLOON HEAD. SHE'S A BALLOON HEAD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S GOOD, BUT I THINK YOU MAY HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE THAN ONE INSULT. AND NOT FOR NOTHING, JUDGING BY THE SIZE OF YOUR CRANIUM... (LAUGHTER) ... I WOULD GO WITH AN INSULT YOU YOURSELF DO NOT SUFFER FROM. (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HELIUM HOUSES... (LAUGHTER) WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO GOT KEITH'S OLD TIME SLOT, LAWRENCE O'DONNELL? LET'S SEE HOW HE'S DOING.
SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THE BULLET CAPACITY OF THESE WEAPONS BUT NEWSPAPERS FROM THE  "NEW YORK TIMES" TO THE....
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, SLOW TALKER. GUYS, OLER MAN WAS A FIVE POOL PLAYER, WAGE, EGO, WIT, SCHOLARSHIP. AFTER YOU DELIVER A RANT, I WANT TO FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TWO WEEKS OFF AND A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. THAT THING THAT I SAID. (LAUGHTER) IS THERE NO ONE ON MSNBC THAT CAN SHOULDER THIS OLBER-BURDEN?
EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID TO ME IS FALSE! GET THIS IDIOT OFF MY RADIO SHOW!
Jon: WHAT WAS THAT?
YOU'RE TOO STUPID TO READ! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THIS SOUNDS PROMISING. IT'S ED SCHULTZ HOST OF THE CREATIVELY NAMED "ED SHOW." WHAT'S HE GOT TO OFFER?
THE REPUBLICANS LIE! I KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THEY WANT TO TAKE DOWN AMERICAN WORKERS. THEY WANT TO OUTSOURCE JOBS. THEY WANT TO SEE YOU DEAD! I WILL FIGHT THESE BASTARDS EVERY NIGHT AT 6:00. THEY'D RATHER MAKE MONEY OFF YOUR DEAD CORPSE! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES, ONLY ED SCHULTZ CAN HELP RID AMERICA OF NECK ROE FEEL YAK PIMPS. (LAUGHTER) STILL, THOUGH, GREAT ENERGY. I LOVE THE RAGE, I LOVE TO SIGH THE INSULTS MORE PERSONAL. BUT IN A MORE SELF-UNAWARE WAY.
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY CHRIS CHRISTIE, I MEAN, THIS GUY IS NOTHING BUT A BIG BULLY. HE'S A COLD-HEARTED FAT SLOB ANYWAY. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHEN HE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE HEARS, HE ACCUSES THE OTHER SIDE OF SHOUTING. IT'S A TYPICAL, TYPICAL RIGHT-WING APPROACH TO THE COMPETITION.
Jon: YES. IF THERE'S ONE THING MR. SCHULTZ CAN'T STAND IT'S A HEAVY-SET MAN SHOUTING AT YOU. (LAUGHTER) I GUESS IF THERE WAS EVER A SHOW CALLED "OLBERMANN'S ID" HE COULD  HAVE THAT. IT'S CLEAR MSNBC DID NOT PLAN FOR THE EVENTUALITY OF OLER MAN'S DEPARTURE. TO TRULY BE ASSURE OF A RIGHTFULARY ONE WOULD HAVE TO RAISE THE BROADCASTER FROM  SCRATCH, BEEF FROM THE FINALEST COWS, VINEGAR FROM THE SOUREST GROUPS AND A HUMAN EXPERIMENT AS  DIABOLICAL AS IT IS GENIUS. TO THE OLBER-FARM! YES! (CHILDREN SHOUTING)
HAVE YOU NO SHAME? HAVE YOU NO SHAME?
IT'S A BASIC SOCIAL CAUSE!
Jon: (LAUGHS)
