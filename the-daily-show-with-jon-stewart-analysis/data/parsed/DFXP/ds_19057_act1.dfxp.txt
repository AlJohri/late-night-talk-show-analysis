FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OH, WE'VE GOT A SPECIAL ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO, THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK, BILL DEBLASIO WILL BE HERE. COURSE, SUPER BOWL LAST NIGHT, WHERE THE DENVER BRONCOS SCORED SOME AMAZING FIELD LEVEL SEATS TO A BLOWOUT VICTORY BY THE SEAHAWKS. THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CLOSER TO THE ACTION. I HEARD. I HAD A TiVo FOUL UP. I SPENT THE NIGHT WATCHING NBC'S NEW GAME SHOW SOUP OR BOWL. [LAUGHTER] IT'S WHERE CONTESTANTS ARE FORCED TO EITHER CHOOSE SOUP  OR A BOWL. IT'S A CATCH 22, YOU CHOOSE SOUP, YOU GOT NO BOWL, YOUR HANDS AND THEN OF COURSE IF YOU CHOOSE BOWL, YOU GET A BOWL AND NO SOUP. IT'S A TERRIBLE SHOW. [LAUGHTER] I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH, I LEARNED SOMETHING INTERESTING, THAT IF YOU ARE IRISH AND MARRIED -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED IS A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR A MARRIED IRISH MAN IS A TASTE OF YOUR LUCKY CHARMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY LOVELY COUPLE WHO ANNOUNCED TO US THEIR PLANS AFTER THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO IS HERE. APPARENTLY TO SHOVEL OUTSIDE. TODAY NEW YORK HIT WITH SIX TO LET'S SAY 28 INCHES OF SNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE MAYOR WITH A CHANCE FOR SOME SNOW REMOVAL REDEMPTION.
THIS IS THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL THAT MAYOR DEBLASIO HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH SINCE HE CAME UNDER FIRE FOR THE HANDLING OF THE LAST SNOWSTORM IN LATE JANUARY. MANY ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE AND OTHER AREAS IN MANHATTAN COMPLAINED THAT SNOW PLOWS DID GET TO THEM FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS  WHILE OTHER ARTERIES IN PLACES LIKE BROOKLYN AND QUEENS WERE  FULLY CLEAR.
YOU CAN IMAGINE DEBLASIO GOT AN EARFUL FROM THE TONY UPPER EAST SIDE RESIDENTS USED TO MAYOR BLOOMBERG CARRYING THEM INDIVIDUALLY FROM THEIR APARTMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] TO THE CHOPPER. [ LAUGHTER ] DID DEBLASIO HANDLE TODAY'S SNOWFALL BETTER? BEST (bleep) SNOW TEAM ON TELEVISION HAS THE ANSWERS. FIRST! WE GO TO SAMANTHA BEE IN TIMES SQUARE. SAM, NICE TO SEE YOU. WHOA LOOK AT THAT! THAT'S INCREDIBLE! IT'S LOOKING REALLY GOOD THERE, SAM.
MHM, YES THEY CLEARED THE SNOW RIGHT AWAY. IT MEANS BUSINESS IS BOOMING FOR THIS QUINTESSENTIAL NEW YORK LANDMARK DISTRICT. PLACES LIKE YE OLD DISNEY STORE.
Jon: SURE.
NEW YORK'S FAMOUS OLIVE GARDEN. THE M AND M STORE AND YOU DON'T GET MORE NEW YORK THAN THE HISTORIC BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP COMPANY.  [LAUGHTER] SHRIMP SCAMPI. FRIED SHRIMP. BARBECUED SHRIMP. SHRIMP COCKTAIL. ONLY IN NEW YORK, KIDS. ONLY IN NEW YORK.
Jon: THANK YOU SAM, AND HE ALSO APPARENTLY MADE IT DAY. JESSICA WILLIAMS OUT IN BROOKLYN A BOROUGH LEFT TRADITIONALLY SLIGHTLY UNDERSERVED. JESSICA, HOW DID IT GO OUT THERE IN BROOKLYN TODAY?
IT WENT PRETTY GOOD, JON. [LAUGHTER] THERE ARE NO TRAFFIC PROBLEMS. IN FACT IT'S 82 DEGREES AND IT'S SUNNY.
Jon: MAYOR DEBLASIO MADE IT SUMMER IN BROOKLYN. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
I DON'T KNOW BUT THE ONLY SNOW IN SIGHT IS RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] THE MAN LOVES BROOKLYN. SO STAY COOL.
Jon: THANK YOU, JESSICA. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO MANHATTAN AND CHECK IN ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE. ASSIF MANDVI, HOW ARE CONDITIONS THERE, AASIF?
WELL NOT GOOD, JON. NOT ONLY HAVE THEY NOT CLEARED THE STREETS IT SEEMS THAT DEBLASIO'S PLOWS ARE ACTIVELY BRINGING SNOW IN.
Jon: HOLY (bleep), AASIF, ARE YOU-- YOU LOOK COMPLETELY BURIED IN A SNOWBANK. ARE YOU COLD? ARE YOU OKAY?
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS, JON, BUT HEY THAT'S LIFE IN DE BLASIO'S NEW YORK. IT SEEMS HE'S HELL BENT ON MAKING THE CITY UNLIVABLE FOR THE RICH.
Jon: AASIF, IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.
EVERYONE IS SO COVERED IN SNOW THAT THE BARNEY'S SECURITY GUARDS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO TO DETAIN ANYMORE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I CAN SEE IT COVERS EVERYBODY.   EVERYBODY LOOKS WHITE. WHO DO YOU HOLD? LISTEN. AASIF--  [GUNFIRE] AASIF -- WHAT IS THAT?
JON, THAT'S THE SOMALI WARLORDS, THEY'VE KIND OF TAKEN OVER PARK AVENUE. THEY ARE BATTLING THE POLAR BEARS FOR DOMINANCE.
Jon: ALRIGHT, AASIF MANDVI ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. [APPLAUSE] THE BEST (bleep) SNOW TEAM ON TELEVISION. JUST BECAUSE THE MAYOR IS HERE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THIS WILL BE A STRICTLY LOCAL ISSUES SHOW. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A NATIONAL PLATFORM HERE. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEW JERSEY. [LAUGHTER] REMEMBER WHEN THAT GUY SAID THAT THING ABOUT THE TRAFFIC JAM? FORT LEE WITH THE -- REMEMBER?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT TO TELL THEM THAT I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS, OF THE PLANNING, EXECUTION OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND THAT I FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AFTER IT WAS OVER. AND EVEN THEN WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS THAT IT WAS A TRAFFIC STUDY.
Jon: AND EVEN THEN I DIDN'T HEAR IT BECAUSE I WAS WEARING HEADPHONES AND EVEN THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED IT BECAUSE I WAS SURE THAT EVERYONE WAS WHISPERING ABOUT A SURPRISE PARTY FOR ME TO CELEBRATE MY PREMEDITATED AND VINDICTIVE CLOSING OF THE -- OH WHAT HAVE I DONE? [LAUGHTER] THAT'S GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE OF NEW JERSEY BASICALLY PLACING  [LAUGHTER] -- YOU LIKE THAT?-- BASICALLY PLACING HIS ENTIRE POLITICAL FUTURE ON THE UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE FORT LEE GW BRIDGE TRAFFIC CLOSURES.
EXPLOSIVE NEW ALLEGATIONS IN THE BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL. DAVID WILDSTEIN SAYS CHRISTIE KNEW ABOUT THE LANE CLOSURES AS THEY WERE HAPPENING.
Jon: OH, THIS (bleep) JUST GOT REAL. [ LAUGHTER ] IN THAT THEY WERE REAL BUT -- I MEAN IT'S NOT -- THEY DIDN'T GET MORE REAL. IT'S JUST NEW ALLEG-- WHO IS THIS WILDSTEIN GUY AND WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE HIM?
DAVID WILDSTEIN WAS CHRISTIE'S PORT AUTHORITY APPOINTEE.
THEY COME FROM THE SAME TOWN. BOTH ATTENDED THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL. "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL" HAS PHOTOS OF THEM CHUMMING IT UP.
Jon: CHUMMING IT UP? YOU KNOW UNLESS THEY WERE FRIENDS IN THE 1920'S. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE CHUM IT UP SO MUCH ANYMORE. BROMANCE, YEAH I GET THAT. MAN CRUSH, OK, I GET THAT. BUT IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD, CHRISTIE. YOUR ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T JUST GIVE A JOB TO YOUR SCHOOL MATE IT CREATED A BRAND NEW POSITION JUST FOR HIM.
DAVID AND I WERE NOT FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE WERE NOT EVEN ACQUAINTANCES IN HIGH SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY THAT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND MATURE AND NONPEJORATIVE WAY OF DESCRIBING A NONRELATIONSHIP. IN FACT, IF YOU WERE STOP RIGHT THERE I WOULD DEEM THAT EVIDENCE IN YOUR COLUMN THAT YOU ARE NOT THE PETTY VINDICTIVE BULLY THAT THESE OTHER ALLEGATIONS MIGHT SUGGEST.
I WAS THE CLASS PRESIDENT AND ATHLETE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAVID WAS DOING DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. [Audience: OHHH]
Jon: UNTIL THAT ONE DAY WHEN WE BOTH HAD SATURDAY DETENTION IN THE LIBRARY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MAYBE WE LEARNED WE AREN'T SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] â™ª DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME  BY THE WAY THAT WAS JUST CHRISTIE GETTING CARRIED AWAY AT A PRESS CONFERENCE. OF COURSE IT'S BEFORE WILDSTEIN CLAIMED THAT HE HAD PROOF THAT CHRISTIE KNEW. A CHARGE CHRISTIE WILL HAVE TO REFUTE MORE SERIOUSLY THAN JUST THE HIGH SCHOOL CHARACTER ASSASSINATION.
IN AN EMAIL TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY OBTAINED BY ABC NEWS, THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WENT AFTER WILDSTEIN  >>CLAIMS THAT AS A 16-YEAR-OLD KID HE SUED OVER A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION. >>HE WAS PUBLICLY ACCUSED BY HIS HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER OF DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NOW THAT (bleep) REALLY DOES GO ON YOUR PERMANENT RECORD. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, PUBLICLY ACCUSED BY HIS HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER OF DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? WILDSTEIN STAND UP. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, DID YOU? [LAUGHTER] YOU JUST WANTED A HALL PASS YOU SON OF A BITCH! WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE STAR ATHLETE AND CLASS PRESIDENT CHRIS CHRISTIE? [LAUGHTER] HE'S OUT THERE BANGING CHEERLEADERS. [APPLAUSE] SO WILDSTEIN WAS A CONNIVING, UNATHLETIC, CAR-LESS MASTURBATOR WHO CHRISTIE DECIDED TO CREATE A POSITION FOR AT THE PORT AUTHORITY BECAUSE, "HE WAS WELL SUITED TO THE TASK OF REFORMING THE PORT AUTHORITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS"  SINCE I GUESS NONE OF THOSE GOALS INVOLVE TRUTHFULLY  COMPLETING LAST NIGHT'S SOCIAL STUDIES HOMEWORK. [LAUGHTER] I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MEDIA TEAR INTO THIS ONE.
WE MUST WAIT AND SEE FOR THE EVIDENCE TO COME OUT. >>WE'RE WAITING ON THE EVIDENCE.
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO SMOKING GUN, NO EVIDENCE.
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO TAKE A BREATH AND LET THE FACTS COME  OUT.
IT'S VERY MUCH WAIT AND SEE.
WE'RE ALL IN WAIT AND SEE MODE.
WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE PROOF IS.
Jon: WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE? [LAUGHTER] WAIT AND SEE? WHERE IS YOUR RUSH TO JUDGMENT? KEEP IT DOWN. WHAT IF NANCY GRACE HEARS YOU TALKING LIKE THIS? WHERE IS THE IMMEDIATE EULOGIES FOR HIS POLITICAL CAREER, THE SWIFT IMPATIENT JUSTICE IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION, YOU KNOW THE NEWS? I CAN'T HELP BUT BE DISAPPOINTED, NOT IN THE GOVERNOR I EXPECT THAT TO BE CORRUPT. BUT IN THE NEWS MEDIA. IF THIS MEASURED APPROACH THING CATCHES ON, I'M OUT A (bleep) JOB. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
