FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST, MY GUEST TONIGHT WILL BE TAVIS SMILEY. HE'S WRITTEN A NEW BOOK, "DEATH OF A KING." IT'S FANTASTIC. BUT FIRST, WE TURN TO ISIS. THE TERRORIST INSURGENT GROUP SLASH ROGUE NATION, SLASH ALL-AROUND LIVING NIGHTMARE, SLASH-NILE RIVER MUD OSIRIS PENIS RECONSTITUTER. YES, ISIS. DIFFERENT ISIS. THAT ISIS. SHE REMADE HER HUSBAND, NILE RIVER MUD PENIS FIRST. I'M JUST REPORTING WHAT I KNOW! YOU KNOW, OUR PRESIDENT HAS SPENT THE PAST FEW WEEKS WORKING ON A STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THE ISIS TERRORISTS, TO REPLACE OUR PREVIOUS STRATEGY OF... NOT HAVING A STRATEGY. NOW TYPICALLY THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN QUITE MEASURED WHEN IT COMES TO MILITARY FORCE.
WHY IS IT THAT EVERYBODY'S SO EAGER TO USE MILITARY FORCE? THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO SYRIA IS NOT SIMPLY A MILITARY ISSUE. WE CAN NOT USE FORCE EVERYWHERE THAT A RADICAL IDEOLOGY TAKES ROOT. WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO PLAY WHACK-A-MOLE AND CHASE WHEREVER EXTREMISTS APPEAR.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT EXTREMIST WHACK-A-MOLE. IT MAY BE MY LEAST FAVORITE WHACK-A-MOLE. EVEN IF YOU WHACK EVERY EXTREMIST, WHAT DO YOU WIN? ENOUGH TICKETS FOR A SLAP BRACELET? THAT HARDLY SEEMS, HARDLY SEEMS A PROPER RETURN ON $3 TRILLION. THE REPUBLICANS, OF COURSE, DO HAVE A STRATEGY.
IF I'M THE PRESIDENT, I'M GONNA SAY LOOK, I'M GONNA KILL EVERY ONE OF THESE BASTARDS.
KILL EVERY ONE OF THESE S.O.B.s.
BOMB THEM BACK TO THE STONE AGE.
WHACK THOSE SUCKERS.
POUND THEM AND POUND THEM.
BLOW THEM TO SMITHEREENS.
SCORCH THE EARTH.
WIPE THEM OUT ALL OF THEM.
Jon:  NOW THAT LAST ONE, THAT WAS UNFAIR TO USE THAT LAST ONE. MR. CHENEY IS NO LONGER IN OFFICE. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO PUT HIM UP THERE. THE POINT IS, WE APPEAR TO BE AT A CROSSROADS BETWIXT THE  NUANCED VISION OF A NON-OMNIPOTENT AMERICA PROJECTING POWER SELECTIVELY AND SOME SORT OF WEIRD ALL POWERFUL TARENTINO AMERICA THAT CLEANSES THE WORLD OF SIN THROUGH SLOW MOTION BLOOD BATHS. LAST NIGHT BARACK OBAMA BROKE OUT HIS I KILLED BIN LADEN STRUT TO DELIVER THE VERDICT!
FIRST, WE WILL CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN OF AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THESE TERRORISTS. WE WILL HUNT DOWN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR COUNTRY WHEREVER THEY ARE. IF YOU THREATEN AMERICA, YOU WILL FIND NO SAFE HAVEN. OUR OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR. WE WILL DEGRADE AND ULTIMATELY DESTROY I.S.I.L.
Jon: WE HAVE OUR ANSWER. (APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT, WELL, LAST NIGHT, LAST NIGHT OUR MOM JEANS-WEARING SOCIALIST MUSLIM DICTATOR TYRANT PACIFIST WENT FULL AMERICA (BLEEP) YEAH!
ABROAD, AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS THE ONE CONSTANT IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD. IT IS AMERICA THAT HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE WILL TO MOBILIZE THE WORLD AGAINST TERRORISTS. BUT AS AMERICANS, WE WELCOME OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD. THE STRATEGY OF TAKING OUT TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN US WHILE SUPPORTING PARTNERS ON THE FRONT LINES IS ONE THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED IN YEMEN AND SOMALIA FOR YEARS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO CITE A SUCCESSFUL ANTI-TERRORIST STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE BEEN PURSUING -- FOR YEARS! (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE PEPE LE PEW CITING HIS SUCCESSFUL SEDUCTION STRATEGY OF RELENTLESS UNCONSUMMATED CAT STALKING. SO WHAT HAS CAUSED THE PRESIDENT TO CITE THE SUCCESS OF HIS CONTAINMENT STRATEGY IN SOMALIA AND YEMEN AS EVIDENCE TO SUPPPORT HIS NEW DEGRADE AND DESTROY STRATEGY AGAINST ISIS?
ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL, 91% OF THOSE ASKED BELIEVED THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES.
65% SUPPORT AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA.
Jon: 65% SUPPORT AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA. AND HERE'S A CUTE FACT. THAT'S A FULL 15 PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WHO CAN CORRECTLY IDENTIFY SYRIA ON A MAP. (APPLAUSE) OH, ISN'T THAT NICE? HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? (BLEEP) IT. IF I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS, IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH KEEPING. (LAUGHTER) IF THAT COUNTRY WAS SO GREAT, WOULDN'T I BE ABLE TO POINT TO IT? C'MON! (LAUGHTER) SO IT SEEMS PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SURRENDERED, WHICH MEANS WE'RE GOING TO WAR. BUT ISIS ISN'T JUST OUR PROBLEM, IT'S THE WORLD'S PROBLEM, SO WHO'S WITH US?
THE CORE COALITION OF TEN COUNTRIES INCLUDING CANADA, BRITAIN, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, POLAND, DENMARK AND AUSTRALIA.
Jon: I'M GOING TO NEED TO SEE THIS ON THE BIG BOARD. AHHH! OKAY. THAT LOOKS AWFUL CHRISTIAN-Y. IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A CRUSADE-Y VIBE. I HESTITATE TO ASK THIS, BUT CAN A BROTHER GET AN OTTOMAN UP IN THIS BITCH?
BUT ONLY OFFICIALLY INCLUDES ONE MUSLIM NATION, TURKEY.
Jon: YES! WE ONLY NEEDED ONE, BABY! COVER SUPPLIED.
ANY SUGGESTION THAT TURKEY IS WELL ON BOARD FOR ANY SORT OF MILITARY ACTION MAY BE A PROBLEM FOR TURKEY.
Jon: BYE TURKEY. WE CAN'T GO TO WAR AGAINST A MUSLIM GROUP WITHOUT A MUSLIM ALLY. NOW WE'RE JUST THE GROUP OF GROWN MEN AT THE ONE DIRECTION CONCERT WITHOUT ANY KIDS. I MEAN, WE'RE THERE FOR THE RIGHT REASON, WE LOVE THE MUSIC, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE THINKS. EVERYONE ELSE THINKS CREEP ALERT. BOOP BOOP. YOU KNOW, I AM SEEING KIND OF A LARGE NOT LIT UP AREA IN THE REGION RIGHT AROUND WHERE I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. CAN WE NOT GET SOME PARTNERS FROM THOSE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES, A GROUP OF THEM, PERHAPS A KIND OF A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD?
IRAN IS AT PRESENT THE ONLY REGIONAL COUNTRY HERE THAT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ACTIVE IN HELPING THE IRAQI MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND.
Jon: IRAN. THAT'S ALL WE GOT, IRAN. THE COUNTRY WHOSE MAIN FUEL SOURCE IS STILL THE BURNING OF OUR FLAGS. IRAN, THAT IRAN. AND OBVIOUSLY THEIR HUGE FIELDS OF OIL.  BUT, YOU KNOW, IT APPEARS TO ME THAT TO ATTACK SUNNI EXTREMISTS BY JOINING THE WESTERN WORLD WITH THE BIG DOG OF THE SHIITE WORLD MIGHT BE LITTLE WEIRD. AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, IN THIS AREA OF NOTHING HAPPENING AND NOBODY JOINING, THE UNITED STATES HAS SUPPLIED THAT AREA WITH BILLIONS IN WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY AND MILITARY TRAINING -- SO, FELLERS --
THERE IS AN AGREEMENT FROM THE SAUDIS TODAY THAT THEY WILL CREATE BASES OR PERMIT THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY TO TRAIN AND AMERICANS WILL BE TRAINING THEM.
Jon: OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH! SO WHILE AMERICA FIGHTS THE GROUP THAT WANTS TO TAKE THE SAUDIS DOWN, THE SAUDIS ARE LETTING US CRASH ON THEIR COUCH! THANKS! THANKS FOR MAKING YOURSELF AVAILABLE ON AIRSTRIKE BNB. OH, YOU'RE SO GREAT! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? ONCE AGAIN -- SAUDIS! (APPLAUSE)
Jon: ONCE AGAIN, IN OUR EXCITEMENT TO EXPORT AMERICAN BOOMOCRACY, WE MAY BE FORGETING A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON.
WE CAN'T ERASE EVERY TRACE OF EVIL FROM THE WORLD.
Jon: DON'T TELL ME! TELL YOU! YOU KNOW, WE HAVE AN ANNIVERSARY TODAY. THE ATTACK OF 13 YEARS AGO TODAY WAS PLANNED BY FOUR DICKHEADS IN A THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN HAMBURG. PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN A TWO-BEDROOM, BUT THEY WANTED A HOME OFFICE. THERE IS NO WAY TO MILITARILY ELLIMINATE ENOUGH SPACE TO  KEEP SOME TERRORISTS FROM OPERATING AGAINST US. SO UNTIL THIS PART OF THE WORLD DECIDES THAT IT IRKS THEM THAT THE BELIEF SYSTEM THEY HOLD SACRED IS MISREPRESENTED TO JUSTIFY A PERPETUAL VIOLENCE MACHINE, UNTIL IT STARTS TO SEE PAST SECTARIAN LINES AND NATIONAL BORDERS THAT -- OKAY, WE DREW, WE'LL GIVE YOU THAT -- THE UNITED STATES CAN'T FIX IT BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE FIXED BY WAVING A MAGIC BOMB -- NOT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE IN DEVELOPMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
