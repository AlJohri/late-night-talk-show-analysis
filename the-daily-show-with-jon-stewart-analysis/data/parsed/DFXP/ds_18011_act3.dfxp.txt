Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  STATISTICIAN AND FOUNDER OF THE  ANY TIMED POLITICAL BLOG  538.COM. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE  SIGNAL AND THE NOISE: WHY SO  MANY PREDICTIONS FAIL BUT SOME  DON'T." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM NATE SILVER. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING  BOOK. I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THE PARTS OF  IT THAT I WAS ABLE TO  UNDERSTAND. WHICH IS VERY MINUTE. BUT OBVIOUSLY MORE IMPORTANTLY,  RIGHT NOW...
RIGHT.
Jon: WHO IS STATISTICALLY  WINNING THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT  BETWEEN BARACK OBAMA AND MITT  ROMNEY?
SO WE HAVE OBAMA AS A MODEST  FAVORITE RIGHT NOW BASED ON  WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE  ELECTORAL COLLEGE. WE'RE STILL IN STATES LIKE OHIO,  IOWA, WISCONSIN THAT WOULD GIVE  OBAMA 207 ELECTORAL VOTES. HE SEEMS TO BE JUST A FINEY BIT  AHEAD.
Jon: AND HOW ABOUT NOW? [LAUGHTER]
WE JUST GOT 20 NEW POLLS IN. THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED. I'VE MISSED MY ABILITY TO UPDATE  THE SITE BECAUSE I'M ON THE SHOW  WITH YOU.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO UPDATE IT  HERE?
NEW YORK I'D RATHER BE ON THE  SHOW FRANKLY. PEOPLE CAN WAIT.
Jon: PEOPLE CAN WAIT.
PEOPLE ARE TOO HYPER ABOUT  THE POLLS ANYWAY.
Jon: THAT'S AN INTERESTING  POINT. IT'S BECAUSE THIS REAL-TIME  OBSESSION IN THE WAY... IT  STRIKES ME AS WHEN THEY STARTED  TO PUT THE NEWS TICKER UP AND THE STOP FIGURES.
RIGHT.
Jon: SUDDENLY, BECAUSE THEY  EXISTED IN REAL TIME, THE  URGENCY OF THE CHANGING OF IT WAS AMPLIFIED.
I THINK PART OF THE WHOLE DOT  COM BOOM BECAUSE WHEN YOU  STARTED TO SEE CNBC PLAYING  INSTEAD OF BASEBALL GAMES IN  BARS. THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION  BOMBARDING ME, HOW CAN I GO  WRONG. IT'S LIKE, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE  MORE INFORMATION, AND WE DON'T  KNOW HOW THE USE IT WELL, IT CAN  GET US INTO MORE TROUBLE.
Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WAS  FASCINATING THAT WHEN YOU TALK  ABOUT PUNDITS, FOR INSTANCE. YOU SAY THAT THE PUNDITS AND  THEIR PREDICTIONS ARE NO BETTER  THAN A COIN TOSS.
YEAH. IF YOU LOOK LONG-TERM HOW DO  PEOPLE IN THE McLAUGHLIN GROUP  DO, THEY GET HALF THEIR  PREDICTIONS RIGHT AND HALF WRONG BECAUSE THEY'RE BASICALLY  ENTERTAINERS. RIGHT, PEOPLE CRITICIZE THIS  SHOW MAYBE AND SAY, IT'S  ENTERTAINMENT MASQUERADING AS  NEWS, BUT A LOT OF NEWS IS ENTERTAINMENT MASQUERADING AS  NEWS.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S  ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DO YOU FORESEE A COIN GETTING  ITS OWN SHOW?
A COIN TOSS?
Jon: THE COIN TOSS SHOW. JUST FLIP IT UP...
MAYBE INSTEAD OF A RECOUNT. THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT IN THE  NFL, JUST HAVE A COIN FLIP. IT'S WITHIN ONE-TENTH OF 1%,  JUST FLIP A COIN.
Jon: ISN'T THERE A POINT  WITH OUR ELECTIONS THAT WE ARE  BEYOND THE ABILITY TO KNOW OF IT STATISTICALLY, THAT WE ARE  BEYOND THE STATISTICAL  PREDICTABILITY.
SURE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE  MINNESOTA RECOUNT, FOR EXAMPLE,  IN 2008, WHERE SHOULD WE COULD A BALLOT CAST FOR LIZARD PEOPLE  AND THE FLORIDA RECOUNT IN 2000,  THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE ELECTION  WAS FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A TIE. WE COULD HAVE RECOUNTED THOSE  BALLOTS 20 TIMES OVER AND MAYBE  SHOULD HAVE A DO-OVER INSTEAD OF  A RECOUNT.
Jon: RIGHT. AS SOMEBODY WHO IS VERY  KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT HOW TO  COMPILE THESE TYPES OF FIGURES,  IS THERE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU WITHIN THESE CAMPAIGNS
THIS IS KIND OF THE REVERSE  OF ""MONEYBALL"" IS THE STORY OF  HOW OUTSIDERS CHANGED THE BASEBALL INDUSTRY, AND IT'S KIND  OF THE REVERSE WHERE THE  CAMPAIGNS KIND OF DO GET IT AND  ESPECIALLY THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO LOOK KARL ROVE WHATEVER  YOU THINK OF HIM WAS A VERY  DRIVEN GUY. JON YAWN WANT KNOW WHAT I THINK  OF HIM? THERE'S THAT FREE TRADE,  WHATEVER YOU THINK OF HIM, AND  I'M LIKE, LET ME TELL YOU.
BUT THE MEDIA IS THE ONE WHO  COVERS THE CAMPAIGNS IN A SILLY  WAY A LOT OF THE TIME WHERE A LOT OF THE TIME, LOOK, NOTHING  HAPPENS OVER THE COURSE OF A  DAY. NOW WE'RE IN THE PENNANT RACE,  SO IT MATTERS, BUT THE AVERAGE  DAY IN APRIL, NOTHING OF  IMPORTANCE HAPPENS, SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LEAD STORY.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO GENERATE  THAT URGENCY.
YOU HAVE TO GENERATE FAKE  NEWS.
Jon: WHY DON'T THEY  COVER... WOW. WHY WAS THAT A BUMPERSTICKER I  SHOULD HAVE ON MY CAR? WHY DON'T THEY COVER THE FACT,  THOUGH, ARE THEY BEING  DISINGENUOUS NOT COVERING THE  FACT THAT THESE CAMPAIGNS ARE CONSCIOUSLY PLAYING TO THE  STATISTICS AND THE NUMBERS WHEN  REALLY THEY ARE FOCUSING ON THE  SABERMETRICS OF THIS ELECTION.
I THINK THERE'S NOT A LOT OF  COVERAGE OF WHAT GOES ON BEHIND  THE SCENES. SO WHEN I WENT UP TO NEW  HAMPSHIRE FOR THE PRIMARY, I  WOULD VISIT THE DIFFERENT  CAMPAIGN OFFICES, AND YOU COULD TELL ON THAT BASIS THAT ROMNEY  WAS GOING TO WIN BECAUSE HIS  OFFICE WAS A LIVE OF ACTIVITY. YOU HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE  BUZZING AROUND. YOU GO TO RICK PERRY'S OFFICE  AND THERE'S ONE DUDE THERE. HELLO, HELLO.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU, MY  GUESS IS THAT DUDE WAS AWESOME.
HE WAS HAPPY TO HAVE A  VISITOR.
Jon: HE WAS EXCITED.
AND NEWT GINGRICH HAD FRANK  LUNTZ WANDERING AROUND HIS  OFFICE AND A BUNCH OF FAT  PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: CAN YOU STICK AROUND  FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?
YEAH.
Jon: "THE SIGNAL AND THE  NOISE," IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES  NOW. BUY IT AND ALSO AT THE SAME TIME  A CALCULATOR. NATE SILVER.
