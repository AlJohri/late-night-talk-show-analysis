[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN HISTORIAN WHO HAS WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ABOUT THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS. HER LATEST IS "SIX WOMEN OF SALEM. THE UNTOLD STORIES OF THE ACCUSED AND THEIR ACCUSERS IN THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS."  PLEASE WELCOME MARILYNNE ROACH. HOW ARE YOU?
FINE, THANK YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
MY PLEASURE.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "SIX WOMEN OF SALEM." YOU KNOW, WHAT IS SO FASCINATING ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS HOW LONG WE HAVE HELD IT UP AS SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN PARANOIA AND IGNORANCE AND A CERTAIN, YOU KNOW FUNDAMENTAL FERVOR COMBINE TO CREATE THIS TYPE OF DISASTER, NEIGHBORS TURNING ON NEIGHBORS.
YEAH, IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR THE TIME. USUALLY IT WAS JUST ONE SUSPECT AT A TIME BUT THIS ONE SNOWBALLED FROM THE BEGINNING.
HOW PREVALENT WAS THIS IDEA OF ACCUSING SOMEONE OF WITCHCRAFT AND TAKING THAT TO COURT TO HANG THEM OR --?
WELL, IT WAS A DUE PROCESS.
Jon: INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN A WITCH?
YES, RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL IT HAPPENED EVERY SO OFTEN. IT WOULD -- THEY MADE YOU GO TO TRIAL FOR IT. YOU DIDN'T JUST TAKE THE LAW INTO YOUR OWN HANDS BUT SOME PEOPLE WERE SUSPECTED FOR YEARS AND BRIDGET BISHOP -- ONE OF SIX IN THE BOOK WAS SUSPECTED, ARRESTED AND JAILED BEFORE THIS, AND YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE CASE SO SHE HAS THAT HANGING OVER BUT SHE SURVIVED THE FIRST GO AROUND. THE NEIGHBORS ARE STILL  SUSPICIOUS.
Jon: ONE OF SERVANTS CONFESSES UNDER DURESS.
YES, SHE'S ONE OF FIRST TO BE ACCUSED. SHE SAYS SHE'S NOT GUILTY WHEN THEY -- SHE'S AT THE HEARING AND THE QUESTIONING. THYOU CAN TELL THE MAGISTRATE FIGURES SHE'S GUILTY AND EVERYTHING SHE SAYS IS TAKEN AS ADMISSION. SHE SAID SHE'S NOT GUILTY AND BACKS INTO A CORNER AND SAYS THE WITCH IS INVISIBLE TO ANYONE ELSE.
Jon: EVERY TIME SHE WOULD SAY I'M NOT GUILTY THEY WOULD SAY THAT'S WHAT A WITCH WOULD SAY. AND SHE WOULD BE IN A CORNER.
SHE WAS SAYING OH THEY'RE. AFTER ME TOO. THEY MADE ME PINCH THE GIRLS AND FINALLY SHE HAS SORT OF A FAINTING SPELL AND CAN'T TALK. SHE AGREES WITH ANYBODY THAT THEY SAY MIGHT BE A SUSPECT.
Jon: IN POPULAR MYTH THEY WERE BURNED OR HAD DUNKING. THEY PUT THEM IN THE WATER AND IF THEY  FLOATED THEY WERE A WITCH. IN REALITY, THEY WENT TO TRIAL AND THEY WERE HUNG. IT'SO NOT AS BIZARRE.
THERE WAS THE HEARING, GRAND JURY AND TRIAL JURY AND EVIDENCE AND STUFF.
Jon: YOU HAVE THE NOTES FROM THESE TRIALS.
A LOT OF IT SURVIVED. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S REMEMBERED SO WELL. A LOT OF IT IS IN PRINT NOW.
Jon: IT'S HELD UP AS SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF PARANOIA. THEY APOLOGIZE AND CAME TO THEIR SENSES PRETTY QUICK.
NOT QUICK ENOUGH FOR 19 OR 20 OF THEM. SEPTEMBER WAS AWFUL. THERE WERE EIGHT PEOPLE HANGED AND A LOT OF ACCUSATIONS. IN OCTOBER THEY DREW BACK AND RECONSIDERED HOW THEY WERE GOING TO DO THIS BY ACCEPTING SPECTRAL EVIDENCE, WHICH IS REPORTS OF WHAT SPIRITS WERE DOING, WHICH IS REPORTS OF WHAT THE WITCHES WERE DOING, IF THAT CAN BE COUNTERFEITED BY THE DEVIL THEY FINALLY FIGURED ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE ACCUSED MENTIONED IT ON THE FIRST DAY.
Jon: EVEN IN THEIR ILLOGIC THERE WAS LOGIC.
YES.
Jon: IT'S BIZARRE.
HUMAN NATURE.
Jon: YOU SEE IT IN OUR DEALINGS TODAY NOT TO THIS EXTREME OBVIOUSLY BUT THE SAME MECHANICS OF IT EMOTIONALLY.
HUMAN NATURE.
Jon: YOU'VE STUDIED THIS A LONG TIME. DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IN PEOPLE? WHERE DO YOU GO ON THE SPECTRUM?
DO I BELIEVE IN WITCHES?
Jon: NO, NO. I GUESS MY POINT IS ARE YOU A WITCH? DOES IT LESSEN YOUR BELIEF IN PEOPLE?
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE CYNICAL. WELL THEY DID APOLOGIZE AND THE MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNMENT TRIED TO MAKE AMENDS LATER AFTER PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED AND THEIR FAMILIES PETITIONED THEY DID CLEAR THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE PETITION SO THAT IF YOU HAD A DEATH SENTENCE THAT WAS PASSED IF YOU WEREN'T HANGED YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT AND THEY DID REIMBURSE THE JAIL EXPENSES. YOU HAD TO PAY ROOM AND BOARD.
Jon: WHEN YOU WERE IN JAIL?
DOESN'T GROW ON TREES. SHACKLES ARE EXTRA.
Jon: IF THEY ACCUSED YOU THEY WOULD SEND YOU TO JAIL AND CHARGE YOU. AND THEY WERE THE WITCHES. ALL RIGHT.
COMING OUT OF TAXPAYERS POCKET.
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. FASCINATING STUFF AND NICE TO SEE IT LAID OUT BECAUSE THE MYTHS AND REALITY COME TOGETHER. IT'S NICELY DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SIX WOMEN OF SALEM ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MARILYNNE ROACH.
