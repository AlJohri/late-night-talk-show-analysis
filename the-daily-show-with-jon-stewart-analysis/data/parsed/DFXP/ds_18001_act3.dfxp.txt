Jon: MY GUESTS TONIGHT,  ACTOR, FORMER GOVERNOR OF  CALIFORNIA, HIS NEW MEMOIRS IS  CALLED "TOTAL RECALL", MY UNBELIEVABLE TRUE LIFE STORY,  ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER!
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU ARE LOOKING GOOD,  WHAT DO YOU BENCH, 150?  160?
A LITTLE HIGHER.
Jon: A LITTLE HIGHER?
EXACTLY.
Jon:.
I STOPPED BENCHING IN HIGH  SCHOOL SO I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT  IS. "TOTAL RECALL", SO, LISTEN, SO  YOU OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE  TO GET THE ELEPHANT OUT OF THE  ROOM, OBVIOUSLY WHAT EVERYBODY IS THINKING ABOUT WHEN THEY LOOK  AT THIS IS WHAT WERE YOU  THINKING WITH JINGLE ALL THE  WAY?  WHY WRITE THE BOOK NOW WHEN YOU, WHEN YOU GO ON THE  SHOW, THEY ARE JUST GOING TO  DREDGE UP ALL OF THIS TERRIBLE  STUFF. WHY NOT WAIT UNTIL THE COPS, THE  HEAT, EVERYTHING COOLS OFF?  WHY  DO IT NOW?
WELL, I NEVER WAS THE KIND OF  PERSON THAT RUNS AWAY FROM THE  PROBLEM, SO I RUN TOWARDS IT, AND THE THING IS, THIS IS A  MISTAKE THAT I MADE, I FEEL  EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT AND ASHAMED  OF IT, I HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I WANTED IT TO BE A PART OF  THE BOOK BECAUSE MY BOOK IS ALL  ABOUT A GREAT IMMIGRANT STORY  AND WITH ALL OF THE SUCCESSES AND ALSO ALL MY FAILURES AND THE  MISTAKES I HAVE MADE.
Jon: SO IT IS SHAKESPEAREAN  TO SOME EXTENT.
IT IS THE WHOLE PACKAGE, IS  WHAT IT IS. SO, YOU KNOW, THOSE QUESTIONS  WILL COME UP NO MATTER WHAT, IF  THEY COME UP NOW OR COME UP IN  THE NEXT MOVIE, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THOSE KIND OF THINGS. IT IS MUCH BETTER TO JUST TALK  ABOUT IT, PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED  TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT, IT IS  IN THE BOOK, I WRITE ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND ALSO I GO OUT  AND DO INTERVIEWS AND DEAL WITH  IT AND LET THE QUESTIONS COME  UP.
Jon: DID ANYBODY EVER SAY,  LIKE DON'T DO THIS, DUDE, DON'T,  DON'T, DON'T.
I THINK THAT MY KIDS HAVE A  HARD TIME WITH IT.
Jon: SURE.
LOOK, THIS WAS VERY TOUGH ON  MARIA.
Jon: SURE.
THIS WAS VERY TOUGH ON MY  CHILDREN, IT WAS VERY TOUGH ON  SOME OF MY FRIENDS AND  EVERYTHING LIKE THAT, I DISAPPOINTED AWE ALL OF THEM.
Jon: IT IS FEW ON ME RIGHT  NOW. I DON'T LIKE THIS.
THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT.
Jon: I AM UNCOMFORTABLE. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT  EITHER. STOP.
COULDN'T YOU JUST GO TO THE  FUTURE AND THEN COME BACK AND  KILL THAT ARNOLD?  AND THEN  THERE COULD BE SOME -- THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOU COULD DO.
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE THAT  OUT, BUT IT DIDN'T COME UP WITH  THAT SOLUTION.
Jon: SO YOU COME OUT WITH  THIS AND YOU STARTLES A THINK  TANK.
RIGHT.
Jon: AT USC. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE THINK  TANK?
THE USC SCHWARZENEGGER,  BASICALLY THINK TANK.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER  THAN THAT.
THE SCHWARZENEGGER THINK  TANK?
THE INSTITUTE OF STATE AND  GLOBAL POLICY THAT WE DEAL WITH  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, ECONOMIC  ISSUES, HEALTHCARE ISSUES, AND ESPECIALLY STUDYING OF HOW DO WE  BRING BOTH OF THE PARTIES  TOGETHER SO THEY CAN MAKE  DECISIONS. RATHER THAN WHAT IS GOING ON IN  WASHINGTON RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY  ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING ABOUT WHO IS  RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG, POINTING FINGERS AT EACH OTHER AND  NOTHING GETS DONE.
Jon: SO YOU ESTABLISH A  PLACE WHERE PERHAPS THEY COULD  COOPERATE AND, IF YOU THINK IT  IS POSSIBLE.
HOW DO WE GET FUTURE LEADERS  TO LEARN ABOUT THAT?  BECAUSE  SO  MANY TIMES YOU LEARN THINGS AT UNIVERSITIES AND HOW TO CRAFT  POLICY AND HOW TO REALLY SOLVE A  PROBLEM, BUT THEN THE NEXT STEP  IS HOW DO YOU GET IT REALLY DONE, WHEN POLITICS GETS  INBETWEEN, AND I SAW THIS  FIRSTHAND WHEN I WAS IN  SACRAMENTO, THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS PUT ON THE TABLE AND  WE HAD GREAT IDEAS BUT QUESTION  CAN'T ALWAYS GET IT DONE BECAUSE  OF THE FIGHTING THAT IS GOING ON AND THE POLITICS.
Jon: THE WHOLE IDEA, HOW  DIFFICULT IS IT FOR YOU, YOU  HAVE GOT THE ENTIRE LEGEND OF  ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, THE BODY BUILDER, THE ACTION STAR, AND  YOU GET IN AND YOU CAN BE  STOPPEDABLE -- IN THE OLD DAYS I  REMEMBER, WHO WAS IT, PREDATOR COULDN'T STOP YOU. BUT NOW YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA  AND SOME GUY FROM SACRAMENTO, A  DEMOCRATIC STATE SENATOR IS LIKE  -- DON'T YOU -- WASN'T THAT MANY SOME WAYS A RUDE AWAKE MING TO  SOMEONE WHO WAS A HOLLYWOOD  LEGEND ACCUSTOMED TO EVERYTHING  COMING HIS WAY?
WELL, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT  WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT  BY BRINGING BOTH OF THE PARTIES TOGETHER, I MEAN, REMEMBER THAT  WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA STEM CELL  RESEARCH, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,  MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE OR COUNTRY PUT ASIDE FOR SPECIFIC  RESEARCH AND STARTED REBUILDING  THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE,  THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS GOT TOGETHER AND GOT IT APPROVED  AND PUT IT ON THE BALLOT, THE  PEOPLE APPROVED IT, $42 BILLION  SO A LOT OF THINGS LIKE THAT, REBUILDING OUR PRISONS AND ALSO  ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS, REDUCING  OUR GREENHOUSE GAS, 25 PERCENT,  ALL OF THIS STUFF WAS DONE BUT THERE WERE OTHER THINGS THAT  WERE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND IT  WAS A REAL EYEOPENER LIKE YOU  SAID, WHEN I SAT THERE AND SAID LOOK, WE HAVE TO CUT DOWN THE  SPENDING BY $5 BILLION AND THEY  SAID, HELL NO, WE WILL CONTINUE  SPENDING BECAUSE THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATE TOES PROGRAMS AND  THOSE SERVICES, WE ARE NOT GOING  TO HAVE WELFARE REFORM AND NOT  DO THIS OR THAT, SO I WAS RUNNING UP AGAINST THE WALL.
Jon: CALIFORNIA IS A VERY  INTERESTING STATE BECAUSE THEY  HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO  RAISE PROPERTY TAXES. THEY ARE SORT OF THIS STRANGE  DIRECT WHERE THEY CAN PUT THINGS  ON REFERENDUM WHERE YOU CAN'T  RAISE TAXES BUT THE PEOPLE CAN ALSO VOTE ON WHAT THEY WANT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: SO IT IS THE PERFECT  SYMBOL FOR THE DIFFICULTIES WE  HAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF GETTING  THE SERVICES WE WANT WHILE CONVINCING PEOPLE THAT THEY DO  HAVE TO BAY FOR IT.
YES. YOU HAVE THAT ROB, BUT YOU ALSO  HAVE THE OTHER PROBLEM, WHICH IS  THAT MISTAKES WERE MADE, NOT  ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, WHEN IT COMES  TO PENSIONS. WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA NOW FOR  INSTANCE $400 BILLION OF  UNFUNDED LIABILITY, THIS IS  SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE BY THE LEGISLATURE, NOT BY THE PEOPLE,  SO THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF  MONEY THAT IS BEING GOING OUT,  AND NOW IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAMS FOR THE PEOPLE, JUST  BECAUSE IT IS FOR RETIRED PEOPLE  AND KIND OF LIKE YOU ARE LIVING  IN THE PAST, YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF THINGS IN THE PAST RATHER  THAN LOOK TO LOOKING TO THE  FUTURE AND BUILDING SCHOOLS AND  ROADS AND UNIVERSITIES AND LESS STUDY --
Jon: I KEEP COMING BACK TO  THIS IDEA, IF ONLY SOMEBODY  COULD COME BACK FROM THE FUTURE. DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES  TO STICK AROUND?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. "TOTAL RECALL" IS ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW, ARNOLD  SCHWARZENEGGER, WE WILL BE RIGHT  BACK.
