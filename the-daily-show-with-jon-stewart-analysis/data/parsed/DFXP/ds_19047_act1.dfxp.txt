JANUARY 15TH, 2014 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT THAT WE BAKED FROM SCRATCH. WE'VE GOT FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT GATES IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HE'S GOT A NEW BOOK OUT CALLED "DUTY." [LAUGHTER] HEE HEE HEE [LAUGHTER] IT'S ACTUALLY THE TITLE "DUTY." HEE HEE HEE [LAUGHTER] ACTUALLY THAT'S A MISNOMER IT'S QUITE GOOD. NOW TONIGHT IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL HERE AT THE PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO TOP STORIES OF EQUIVALENT WEIGHT. NUMBER ONE.
THE U.S. AND OTHER WORLD POWERS HAVE AGREED ON A DATE TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING AN INTERIM DEAL TO CURB IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THAT IS SET TO START ON JANUARY 20TH.
Jon: A NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN. PEACE IN OUR TIME! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THINK ABOUT IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ON THE DOWNSIDE THINK ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO SEASON FOUR OF "HOMELAND" BUT STILL THAT SHOW COULD END UP COMPLETELY UNTETHERED FROM REALITY. [LAUGHTER] SO THAT'S STORY ONE. OUR SECOND TOP STORY.
LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S >DEPUTIES ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE TODAY AT THE HOME OF POP SUPERSTAR JUSTIN BIEBER SEARCHING FOR EVIDENCE INVOLVING THE EGGING OF HIS NEIGHBOR'S HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THE ONLY THING TO SAY THERE IS DUN-DUN-DUN. THE STORIES HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON, DON'T THEY? TWO WARRING NATIONS, TWO WARRING NATIONS TURNING SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES WHILST SIMULTANEOUSLY A SMALL INCREDIBLY SMOOTH CHESTED BOY MAN TERRORIZES HIS NEIGHBORS WITH GROCERIES. COINCIDENCE? NO I READ THE BIBLE. GOD THAT CHEST IS SMOOTH. IT'S LIKE SILK. YOU JUST WANT TO WRAP HIM AROUND YOURSELF LIKE A KIMONO. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME LISTEN TO YOU BREATHE. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S FROM MY ONE MAN SHOW "WOW THAT GUY IS (bleep) CREEPY."  ANYWAY THE TWO STORIES ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. LET'S START WITH THE MORE IMPORTANT STORY. BIEBER. WHY ARE THE POLICE INVESTIGATING AN EGGING.
THE NEIGHBOR CLAIMS THE INCIDENT CAUSED UP TO $20,000 IN DAMAGE.
Jon: $20,000 IN DAMAGE FOR EGGING A HOUSE, WHAT DID YOU-- WERE THEY FABERGE EGGS? WHAT DID YOU THROW? DID YOU HARD BOIL THEM WHAT THE HELL? ALRIGHT $20,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE. LOOKS LIKE THE BIEBS IS FINALLY GOING DOWN. HAPPY, HATERS? WITH AN 8 INSTEAD OF AN A-T-E BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THREE LETTERS WHEN I COULD GET THE SAME PHONETIC  EFFECT BY JUST PUTTING IN A NUMBER.
WHILE THE TEEN POP STAR WAS NOT ARRESTED,  A RAPPER KNOWN AS LITTLE ZA WHO WAS AT BIEBER'S HOME DURING THE POLICE SEARCH WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON A DRUG CHARGE.
Jon: BOY AIN'T THAT THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. WOW, HOW BOUT THAT. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED, WHITE GUY BREAKS SOME [BLEEP], COPS COME AND TAKE THE BLACK GUY AWAY. OH YEAH.  â™ª AMERICA  ALL RIGHT. LITTLE ZA I'M SURE MR. AND MRS. ZA ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS:  WE'RE ALSO ON THE VERGE OF AN HISTORIC TREATY WITH IRAN.
JANUARY 20TH, THAT'S THE DATE IRAN WILL BEGIN TO DISMANTLE PART OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM ELIMINATING SOME OF ITS NUCLEAR FUEL.
BEGINNG FEBRUARY 1, OVER SIX MONTHS SANCTIONS RELIEF WILL BE PAID OUT IN EIGHT INSTALLMENTS OF ROUGHLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS EACH FOR A TOTAL OF 4.2 BILLION DOLLARS IN UNFROZEN OVERSEAS ASSETS.
Jon: WHAT THE HELL, LOOK AT THAT GRAPHIC. WE CAN'T EVEN SEND MONEY TO IRAN WITHOUT IT LOOKING LIKE WE'RE BOMBING THEM. STILL, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES WE WOULD HAVE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN AND A MEANS OF INSURING THAT THEY WOULD NOT OBTAIN A NUCLEAR WEAPON JUST AS LONG AS NOBODY COMES IN AND FIGURATIVELY THROWS EGGS AT THE ENTIRE THING. THE GREATEST THREAT TO THAT LONG AWAITED DEAL IS TAKING SHAPE ON CAPITOL HILL. LAWMAKERS ARE INCHING TOWARDS SLAPPING IRAN WITH NEW HARSH SANCTIONS.
Jon: AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, THAT IS HOW THESE TWO STORIES ARE RELATED. CONGRESS IS THE JUSTIN BIEBER OF OUR GOVERNMENT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THROWING AWAY FOR NO REASON, WHATSOEVER, THROWING AWAY A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF IMMATURITY AND A LACK OF SELF CONTROL. WE GOT GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, RUSSIA, CHINA AND GERMANY AND IRAN TO ALL AGREE TO THIS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MY GOAL IS TO GET NEW SANCTIONS IN PLACE.
Jon: IT'S NOT JUST A GOAL IT'S A RESOLUTION. [ LAUGHTER ] 2014 IS GOING TO BE A NEW YEAR FOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. YOU WANT NEW SANCTIONS GRAHAM? WHAT WERE YOU TELLING US BEFORE IRAN CAME TO THE TABLE ABOUT THE REASON FOR THE SANCTIONS?
WE BELIEVE THAT SANCTIONS AND THE THREAT OF MILITARY FORCE IS THE ONLY THING THAT IS GOING TO BRING THE IRANIANS TO THE TABLE.
Jon: WELL THEY ARE AT THE (bleep) TABLE. SANCTIONS GOT THEM TO THE TABLE AND NOW YOU WANT TO DO MORE SANCTIONS ON TOP OF THAT TO WHAT? GET THEM CLOSER TO THE TABLE? DO THEY HAVE TO JUST BE LIKE THIS? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? IT'S LIKE SANCTIONS ARE THE TAX CUTS OF FOREIGN POLICY. IT'S ALWAYS THE RIGHT ANSWER. IRAN WON'T COME TO THE TABLE SANCTIONS. IRAN WILL COME TO THE TABLE SANCTIONS. YOU WILL TURN THE TV OFF RIGHT MISTER OR SANCTIONS.
THE ADMINISTRATION IS ON DEFENSE BECAUSE  THERE ARE NOW 59 SENATORS INCLUDING 16 DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE DEFIED THE PRESIDENT TO SUPPORT A BILL TO READY NEW SANCTIONS IF DIPLOMATIC TALKS FAIL.
Jon: 16 DEMA -- DEMA -- DEMA -- WHAT? DEMA -- WHO? WHAT? I GET REPUBLICANS. THEY WOULD LINE UP TO OPPOSE  OBAMA ON THE ORGASMS CURE CANCER ACT OR THE RESOLUTION FINDING JENNIFER LAWRENCE DELIGHTFUL BUT DEMOCRATS -- DEMOCRATS -- WHY WOULD THEY VOTE FOR THIS?
WELL, I THINK A LOT OF THEM HAVEN'T READ IT YET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: REALLY? THEY HAVEN'T READ IT YET. THAT'S NEVER SLOWED THEM DOWN BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY? WHY ARE THE DEMOCRATS REALLY VOTING FOR THIS?
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WITH BIG PARTS OF THE PROISRAEL LOBBY AND THE UNITED STATES BEING AGAINST IT, THE COUNTRY OF ISRAEL BEING AGAINST IT, THAT'S A STIFF HILL TO CLIMB.
Jon: OH WELL THAT MAKES SENSE. THE SENATORS FROM THE GREAT STATE OF ISRAEL ARE AGAINST IT AND WE DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST THE SENATORS -- WAIT A MINUTE THAT'S NOT IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER COUNTRY ENTIRELY, WHY DO WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM. I MEAN, ISRAEL IS OUR ALLY AND IRAN I GUESS IS STILL PRETTY PROVOCATIVE.
OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS FROM  IRANIAN PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI ON THE RECENT NUCLEAR DEAL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN POWERS.
Jon:  OOH, OUTRAGEOUS COMMENTS FROM ROUHANI, WELL,  I HAVE THEM RIGHT HERE ACTUALLY HERE IS WHAT HE SAID, SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY TURNED UP HERE ACTING OUT OF MISPLACED OBSESSION AND MESSIANIC FERVOR. THE AMERICAN SECURITY PLAN IS NOT WORTH THE PAPER IT'S PRINTED ON. YOU CAN'T TALK SMACK ABOUT AMERICA AND NOT GET HIT HARD, IRAN, THAT [bleep] DON'T-- WAIT, I'M SORRY I'M BEING TOLD-- I'M SORRY THAT STATEMENT WASN'T FROM THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT ROUHANI IT WAS FROM THE ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER MOSHE YA'ALON. I'M SORRY, HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE  PALESTINIAN PEACE TALK SITUATION AND HIS LACK OF INTEREST IN A TWO STATE SOLUTION. THAT'S MY BAD. SO THAT'S OUR ALLY WE WOULDN'T WANT TO OFFEND THEM BY NEGOTIATING A TREATY WITH A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTITY, WHICH, NOW THAT I KNOW THAT, I SEE IT WAS REALLY JUST... CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM ON HIS PART. SO THAT MAKES SENSE. WHAT DID ROUHANI SAY?
ROUHANI EVEN TOOK TO SOCIAL MEDIA TO TWEET, "WORLD POWERS SURRENDER TO IRANIAN NATION'S WILL." [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHY THE (bleep) DO WE EVEN BOTHER? ARE THERE ANY FOREIGN POWERS MORE MATURE THAN THESE GUYS THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
