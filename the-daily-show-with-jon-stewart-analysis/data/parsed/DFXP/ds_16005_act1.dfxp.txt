JANUARY 10, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" EVERYBODY. JON STEWART. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WOULD LOVE TO SAY THAT WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, UM, NOT SURE THAT'S THE CASE. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE DENIS LEARY IN THE STUDIO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY AFTER WATCHING THE NEWS ALL WEEKEND ALL I WANT TO DO IS VISIT WITH  THE OLD FRIEND AND PERHAPS TRADE INSULTS ABOUT ONE ANOTHER'S ACTING ABILITY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THE EVENTS THIS WEEKEND IN ARIZONA WEIGH HEAVILY. SADLY, IT IS A FEELING THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS EXPERIENCED ALL TOO OFTEN AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR OUR  SHOW, THE CLOSER THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN TOWARDS DISCUSSING AND DEALING WEAPON CURRENT EVENTS IT  HARDER IT BECOMES IN SITUATIONS WHERE REALITY IS TRULY SAD. CAN I GIVE YOU -- I CAN GIVE YOU A TYPICAL COMPILATION OF THE DAY'S NEWS EXCESSES. CLEARLY NONE OF OUR CORRESPONDENTS FEELS LIKE STANDING AROUND, REPORTING  PRETENDING TO BE IN WASHINGTON. AT LEAST I DON'T THINK THEY DO. OLIVER?
YOU ARE RIGHT, JON. NO ONE WANTS TO DO THIS. NO ONE. NO ONE WANTS TO DO THIS SO CAN I GO? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BEFORE YOU GO, IS THERE A REASON YOU ARE IN -- PAN PAN -- PANDA PA JUDGEAS? -- PA JUDGEAS.
THERE A REASON YOU'RE NOT, JON. I'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M IN MY PANDA PJ'S. I'M IN MY CHILDHOOD BEDROOM, JON, WHERE I'M ROCK BACK AND FORTH WONDERING WHY THE COUNTRY I'VE COME TO LOVE SO MUCH  FINDING ITSELF STRUGGLING WITH THE TERRIBLY VIOLENT TRAGEDY.
Jon: WELL, THAT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS WHY YOU ARE IN WASHINGTON. I STILL CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT EXPLAINS WHY YOU HAVE ON ADULT PANDA PAJAMAS.
THAT'S A STUPID QUESTION, JON, BECAUSE CHILDREN'S PANDA PJ'S WOULD LOOK RIDICULOUS ON ME. THEY'D BE TOO SMALL. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN STUNNED BY A TRAGEDY. WE'VE BEEN VISITED BY THIS DEMON BEFORE. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THOSE INJURED OR KILLED AND THEIR LOVED ONES. HOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF THESE TYPES OF SENSELESS SITUATIONS IS REALLY THE|ï¿½ QUESTION THAT SEEMS  TO BE ON EVERYBODY'S MIND. I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS SORT OF THING. AS I WATCHED THE POLITICAL PUNDIT WORLD, MANY ARE REFLECTING AND GRIEVING AND  TRYING TO FIGURE THINGS OUT. IT'S TRUE THAT OTHERS ARE WORKING FEARISHLY -- FEVERISHLY TO FIND FLAME AND EXONERATE THE OTHER. WATCHING THAT IS AS PREDICABLE AS IT IS DISSPIRITTING. DID THE TOXIC POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CAUSE THIS? A GRAPHIC IMAGE HERE, AN ILL-TIMED COMMENT, VIOLENT RHETORIC, THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. I HAVE NO (bleep) IDEA. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN A COMPLEX|ï¿½ ECOSYSTEM OF INFLUENCES AND MOTIVATIONS AND I WOULDN'T BLAME  OUR POLITICAL RHETORIC ANY MORE THAN I WOULD BLAME HEAVY METAL MUSIC FOR COLUMBINE AND THAT IS  COMING FROM SOMEBODY WHO TRULY HATES OUR POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. IT IS TOXIC. IT IS UNPRODUCTIVE BUT TO SAY THAT THAT IS WHAT HAS CAUSED THIS OR THAT THE PEOPLE IN THAT  ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS I DON'T THINK YOU COULD DO IT. BOY, WOULD THAT BE NICE. BOW, IT WOULD BE NICE -- BOY, WOULD IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE OF CAUSATION FROM THIS HORROR TO  SOMETHING TANGIBLE BECAUSE THEN WE COULD CONVINCE OURSELVE, IS THAT IF WE JUST STOPPED THIS THE  HORRORS WOULD END. TO HAVE THE FEELING, HOWEVER FLEETING, THAT THIS TYPE OF EVENT COULD BE PREVENTED FOREVER. IT'S HARD NOT TO FEEL LIKE IT CAN. YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT OUTSMART CRAZY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A TROUBLED MIND WILL GET CAUGHT ON. -- CRAZY ALWAYS SEEMS TO FIND A WAY. TO ALWAYS HAS. THAT IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT RESISTANCE IS FUTURE AISLE. IT SOUND -- FUTURE -- FUTILE. THAT SOUNDED DARK. CRAZY PEOPLE RULE US ALL. I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO WATCH OUR RHETORIC. I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE GOAL NOT TO CONFLATE OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS WITH ENEMIES IF FOR NO  OTHER REASON THAN TO DRAW A BETTER DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MANIFESTOS OF PARANOID MADMEN  AND WHAT PASSES FOR ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL AND PUNDIT SPEAK. IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE IF THE RAMBLES OF -- RAMBLINGS OF CRAZY PEOPLE DIDN'T IN ANY WAY  RESEMBLE HOW WE ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER ON TV. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LET'S AT LEAST --  [  APPLAUSE  ] LET'S -- LET'S AT LEAST MAKE TROUBLED INDIVIDUALS EASIER TO SPOT. [LAUGHTER] AND, YOU KNOW, AGAIN -- IT IS TO SEE GOOD PEOPLE LIKE THIS HURT, IT IS SO GRIEVOUS AND IT CAUSES ME SUCH SADNESS BUT I REFUSE TO GIVE IN TO THAT FEELING OF DESPAIR. THERE'S LIGHT IN THIS SITUATION. I URGE EVERYONE READ UP ABOUT THOSE WHO WERE HURT AND OR KILLED IN THIS SHOOTING. YOU WILL BE COMFORTED BY JUST HOW MUCH ANONYMOUS GOODNESS THERE REALLY IS IN THE WORLD. YOU READ ABOUT THESE PEOPLE AND YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE THAT YOU  DON'T EVEN KNOW, THAT YOU HAVE NEVER MET, ARE LEADING LIVES OF REAL DIGNITY AND GOODNESS. AND YOU HEAR ABOUT CRAZY BUT IT'S RARER THAN YOU THINK. I THINK YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF EVEN MORE|ï¿½ IMPRESSED WITH CONGRESSWOMAN GIFFORDS AND  AMAZED AFTER HOW MUCH LIVING WAS PACKED IN THE LIVES CUT WAY TOO SHORT. AND IF THERE IS REAL SOLACE IN THIS, I THINK IT'S THAT FOR ALL THE HYPERBOLE AND HAVE IT --  VITRIOL WHEN THE REALITY OF THAT RHETORIC, WHEN ACTIONS MATCH THE WORDS WE HAVEN'T LOST OUR  CAPACITY TO BE HORRIFIED. PLEASE LET US HOPE WE NEVER DO. LET US HOPE WE NEVER BECOME NUMB TO WHAT REAL HORROR, THE REAL BLOOD OF PATRIOTS LOOKS LIKEï¿½ï¿½ï¿½i  WHEN IT'S SPILLED. HOPEFULLY IT HELPS US MATCH OUR RHETORIC WITH REALITY MORE OFTEN. THE REALITY OF DANGEROUS RHETORIC IS, I THINK EVEN THOSE WHO SPEAK HYPERBOLICALLY ALL OF  THAT WOULD RECOIL AND SAY, WOW, THAT'S, YOU KNOW -- THAT IS NOT THE PICTURE OF WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING OR TALKING ABOUT. I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE'S A REALITY TO THAT SITUATION THAT  WE CAN'T APPROACH VERBALLY. BECAUSE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WILL SHATTER OUR WORLD AGAIN. AND WOULDN'T IT BE A SHAME IF WE DIDN'T TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND  THE LOSS OF THESE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND THE PAIN THAT THEIR LOVED ONES ARE GOING THROUGH  RIGHT NOW, WOULDN'T IT BE A SHAME IF WE DIDN'T TAKE THAT MOMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE  WORLD THAT WE ARE CREATING NOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE SHATTERED AGAIN BY A MOMENT OF  LUNACY, WOULDN'T IT BE A SHAME IF THAT WORLD WASN'T BETTER THAN  THE ONE WE PREVIOUSLY LOST? SO HOW WILL BE PROCESS THIS TONIGHT? ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. WE'LL COME BACK. I'LL SHOW A FIELD PIECE ABOUT SOMETHING INCREDIBLY STUPID AND SILLY. DENIS LEARY WILL COME OUT HERE. HE AND I WILL MOST LIKELY INSULT EACH OTHER PLAYFULLY. [LAUGHTER] AND THEN TOMORROW, YOU KNOW, WE GO BACK TO TRYING TO DO WHAT WE NORMALLY DO WHICH IS HIGHLIGHT  ABSURDITY IN A CHEMICAL WAY THAT IS A CATHARSIS FOR PEOPLE AND NOT A SADNESS. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I KNOW IT IS PROBABLY MORE HELPFUL FOR ME THAN IT IS FOR YOU BUT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
