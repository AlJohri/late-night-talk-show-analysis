FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT THAT WE WORKED ON ALMOST ALL DAY. OUR GUEST TONIGHT CHELSEA CLINTON, THE DAUGHTER, OF COURSE, OF FAMED MUSICIAN GEORGE CLINTON OF PARLIAMENT FUNKADELIC. WIND ME UP. (LAUGHTER) LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT. WE ARE A CAN-DO PEOPLE. WITH PIONEERING SPIRIT, INDIVIDUALISTS. WELL, AT LEAST OUR GREAT, GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE. BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO CONTEND WITH ALL THE DISTRACTIONS WE DO LIKE TV OR MASTURBATION. DID YOU KNOW STEVE JOBS INVENTED THAT IN 1981? (LAUGHTER) CALLED IT--  (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. I BELIEVE HE CALLED IT THE WHACKINTOSH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ANYHOW, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS AMERICANS LIKE FREEDOM. WE DON'T LIKE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO, WHETHER BY A KING OR THE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE SEAT BELT LAWS OR HAVING TO GET RID OF SLAVES WAS MET WITH SO MUCH RESISTANCE. WELL GUESS WHAT, NOW THEY'RE COMING FOR YOUR HEALTH CARE. OBAMACARE WILL CHANGE YOUR HEALTH CARE. AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW. SOME BUSINESSES COULD GET HIT WITH A 40% ADDITIONAL TAX ON YOUR HEALTH-CARE PLAN. PLEASE GET THE OBAMACARE SURVIVAL GUIDE TODAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THANK YOU,  KEVORKIAN LOOK ALIKE WHO I THOUGHT WAS DEAD. LISTEN, IT'S CLEAR FROM THIS GUY'S TONE THAT OBAMACARE WILL DESTROY ALL THAT WE ONCE HELD DEAR IN THIS COUNTRY, BY REQUIRING HEALTH INSURANCE FROM EMPLOYERS FOR THE 15% OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T CURRENTLY GET THAT. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 50 EMPLOYEES, THE ACT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO ALL THEIR FULL-TIME WORKERS OR PAY A PENALTY. NO WAY AROUND IT. OR MAYBE THERE'S TWO WAYS AROUND IT.
CHUCK, REPLAY THAT AIRTIGHT OBAMACARE REQUIREMENT THAT I JUST MENTIONED.
THE ACT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO ALL THEIR FULL-TIME WORKERS OR PAY A PENALTY. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T REMEMBER WEARING A YACHTING CAP WHEN I SAID THAT. ANYWAY, THERE'S AN OUT FOR EMPLOYERS. THEY CAN PAY A PENALTY WHICH AMOUNTS TO $2,000 PER EMPLOYEE. NOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY UNTIL YOU COMPARE IT TO HOW MUCH IT CURRENTLY COST EMPLOYERS TO INSURE THEIR WORKERS WHICH IS I DON'T KNOW, $10,000 PER EMPLOYEE. SO IF YOU'RE A CORPORATION YOU COULD DO THE RIGHT THING, THE MORAL THING, SPEND ABOUT 10,000 TO GIVE YOUR EMPLOYEES HEALTH INSURANCE OR SAVE ABOUT $8 GRAND AND TELL YOUR EMPLOYEES TO GO [BLEEP] WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN CHOOSING?
WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY AT ALL. WELL, THAT'S WHERE THE OTHER LOOPHOLE COMES IN, THE LAW ONLY APPLIES TO FULL-TIME WORKERS, PEOPLE WHO WORK 30 OR MORE HOURS A WEEK. AND GUESS WHAT.
BASICALLY A LOT OF EMPLOYERS ARE SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THESE HEALTH-CARE BENEFITS SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FULL-TIME WORKERS TO PART-TIME WORKERS.
HE HAS WORKED AT A SUBWAY FRANCHISE IN MAINE FOR A DECADE BUT RECENTLY WAS TOLD HIS HOURS WOULD BE CUT TO 29 A WEEK. LAURYN GOODRICH WHO OWNS 21 SUBWAY FRANCHISES SAYS IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE NEW HEALTH CARE LAW.
SOUNDS LIKE THAT GUY'S IS WORKING ON A NEW SLOGAN FOR SUBWAY. EAT [BLEEP] FOR MORE ON THIS WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN HODGMAN.
HELLO.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF COMPANIES GAMING THE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM.
AMATEURS, JON, REDUCING WORK HOURS, CUTTING EMPLOYEE ROLES, STILL PAYING MANDATORY WORK FOR ON WEEKENDS.
Jon: RIGHT, BUT THEY HAVE TO. HOW DO YOU AVOID PAYING WEEKEND OVERTIME.
SIMPLE, JON, AT MY COMPANY, HODGECO WE USE A DIFFERENT CALENDAR. MEET FRIDAY FOLLOWED BY NEW FRIDAY AND BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND FRIDAY CLASSIC. THE DOWNSIDE NO MORE WEEKENDS BUT THE UPSIDE THREE CONSECUTIVE CASUAL FRIDAYS. DUNGAREES, WHAT COULD BE BETTER THAN THAT.
Jon: OVERTIME PAY.
MY EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND IT'S ALL ABOUT TRADE-OFF. IF I PAY OVERTIME HOW CAN I PROVIDE MATERNITY LEAVE.
Jon: YOU OFFER MATERNITY LEAVE.
OF COURSE I DO. SOMEONE GETS PREGNANT THEY CAN LEAVE. YEAH. THAT JOKE KILLS AT THE ANNUAL [BLEEP] BRUNCH LAST MAY. THE POINT IS WHEN IT COMES TO COST-CUTTING THIS OBAMACARE DODGE IS CHILD'S PLAY. AND SPEAKING OF CHILDREN.
Jon: THIS IS NOT GOING TO END WELL.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL TO HAVE CHILDREN WORK IN YOUR SHIRTWAIST FACTORY.
Jon: I DID KNOW THAT WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW WAS PEOPLE STILL MAKE SHIRTWAISTS.
BUT HERE'S THE LOOPHOLE, JON, IT IS LEGAL FOR KIDS TO WORK IN THE MOVIES.
Jon: I DON'T LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.
YES, I'M MAKING A MOVIE. IT'S A HEARTWARMING STORY ABOUT A BUNCH OF MISFIT KIDS WHO COME TOGETHER UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF A GRUMPY BUT LOVABLE COACH TO FORM AN UNDERDOG SHIRTWAIST FACTORY TO TAKE DOWN THOSE SNOBS AT THE RICH KID SHIRTWAIST FACTORY ACROSS THE LAKE. I'VE BEEN FILMING FOR 7 YEARS. 16 HOURS A DAY. AND WE'RE WAY UNDERBUDGET.
Jon: SO BASICALLY YOU HAVE A SWEATSHOP THAT MAKES OBSOLETE CLOTHING.
NO, I HAVE THE KIDS WORKING ON ALL KINDS OF THINGS, JON, ASBESTOS, PRELIT FIREWORKS, INDUSTRIAL HAND MANGLERS.
Jon: INDUSTRIAL-- WHO WOULD BUY AN INDUSTRIAL HAND MANGLER.
COME ON, JON, IT'S 2013 YOU DON'T WANT TO MANGLE HANDS BY HAND. ASK ANY MOB ENFORCER, YOU CAN GET CARPAL TUNNEL THAT WAY.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND OBAMACARE DOES PUT CERTAIN BURDENS ON BUSINESS BUT DOESN'T THE EMPLOYER BEAR SOME SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THE EMPLOYEE, THIS SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE GIVING A HUGE MIDDLE FINGER TO YOUR WORKERS.
SO YOU HAVE SEEN MY EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION VIDEO.
OH, HELLO. I'M JOHN HODGMAN, ALLOW ME TO BE THE VERY FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO YOUR NEW CAREER AS A PURELY PART-TIME NONEMPLOYEE AND OR HALF PAID INTERN OF HODGECO-- ASBESTOS AND MANGLE. I GOT YOU A GIFT. REACH IN YOUR POCKET THERE IT IS. OKAY. HA, HA, HA. HA, HA, HA. HA, HA, HA, HA, HA.
Jon: HOW DO YOU EVEN GET AWAY WITH THAT. HOW DO YOU GET ANYBODY TO WORK FOR YOU.
JON, WE'VE BEEN AT 7% UNEMPLOYMENT FOR FIVE YEARS. BEING AN EMPLOYER THIS YEAR IS LIKE BEING A GIRL AT COMIC CON. DOES NOT MATTER HOW OFFENSIVELY INACCURATE YOUR PRECRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS YOUR SUPERGIRL COSTUME IS. YOU ARE TO THE GOING HOME ALONE. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HEAD BAND, JOHN.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. JOHN HODGMAN, DERANGED MILLIONAIRE.
