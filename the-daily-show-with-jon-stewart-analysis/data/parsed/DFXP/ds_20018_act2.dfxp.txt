(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY! WELCOME BACK! WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME EXPERT, WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME EXPERT ANALYSIS ON TONIGHT'S ELECTION COMING UP, BUT FIRST A FEW MORE UP-TO-THE-MINUTE RESULTS. WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN. THERE WERE A LOT OF ALSO CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES SEATS THAT WERE UP. HERE'S SOME INCUMBENT REPUBLICANS THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO OUR AUDIENCE. TEXAS' FIRST DISTRICT WHERE LOUIE GOHMERT REPRESENTS IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S AS HIGH AS HE CAN COUNT. HE, HE -- LET'S SEE, HE'S UP AGAINST SHIRLEY MCKELLAR, THE DEMOCRAT, AND HE -- OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THOSE PEOPLE? WE ALSO HAVE PAUL RYAN, HE WINS IN WISCONSIN, THE GUY THE DEMOCRATS PICKED TO LOSE TO PAUL RYAN HAS INDEED LOST TO HIM. SO THAT'S GONE, BUT THIS ONE IS ESPECIALLY, WELL THIS ONE IS A LITTLE NEAR AND DEAR TO THE HEARTS HERE. THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN RUNNING FOR CONGRESS, REPUBLICAN SIDE, WHO HAD A 20-COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM, HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST DOMENIC RECCHIA WHO IS THE DEMOCRAT. LET'S CHECK IN WITH THAT NOW. THE GUY FELL. OH, MY GOD! NO, HE'S GOING TO TAKE HIM! OH, NO! HE'S GOING TO THROW HIM OVER A (BLEEP) BALCONY! (LAUGHTER) EVEN HIS GRAPHIC IMAGE -- LISTEN... NO ELECTION NIGHT COVERAGE IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A PUNDIT PANEL. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU. LATELY WE'VE SEEN EVERY KIND. GREAT AMERICAN PANELS, ALL-WOMAN PANELS, ALL WOMAN PANELS WITH ONE DUDE. WHATEVER THAT IS. PANELS OF PEOPLE NOBODY CARES ABOUT. AND OF COURSE THE CNN 36-BODY MULTI-PANEL. ARE YOU SEEING A PATTERN? IS WHAT I'M ASKING YOU. ALL THOSE PANELS? THE PEOPLE SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. (LAUGHTER) LIVE TV! WELL, TONIGHT, WE BREAK THE MOLD. WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU THE FIRST PUNDIT PANEL TO EVER HARNESS THE POWER OF VERTICALITY! WELCOME TO "THE STACK"! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT ON THE STACK, AASIF MANDVI, JESSICA WILLIAMS, JOHN HODGMAN AND OF COURSE JORDAN KLEPPER. THANKS FOR JOINING US, PANEL. EARLY RESULTS ARE IN, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING TONIGHT, AASIF?
WELL, THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN, JON, AND THEY ARE REJECTING OBAMA'S LEGACY OF TYRANNY. YOU JUST CAN'T REFORM THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WITH EBOLA.
Jon: WELL, JESSICA WILLIAMS, RENOWNED DEMOCRATIC ANALYST, YOU DISAGREE?
JON, IT'S THE MIDTERMS. IT'S MEANINGLESS. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO VOTE ARE ALCOHOLIC RACISTS, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT!
Jon: ALRIGHT.
JON, MAY I MAKE TWO OBSERVATIONS?
Jon: YES YOU MAY, JOHN. JOHN HODGMAN.
FIRST, I'VE BEEN CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS, AND STATISTICALLY JESSICA IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND SECOND, WITH 80% OF MY ASS REPORTING, I CAN NOW CALL IT, I'M CRUSHING JORDAN'S BALLS.
JON, I'M HERE AT JORDAN'S BALLS' HEADQUARTERS. AND I CAN CONFIRM MY COLLEAGUES REPORTS!
JUST LIKE OBAMA'S BEEN CRUSHING AMERICA'S BALLS BY NOT PROTECTING OUR BORDER.
Jon: NO THAT --
THE TRUTH IS ALL ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION. AND TONIGHT LOOKS GOOD FOR HILLARY CLINTON 2016!
Jon: WELL THAT'S -- THAT'S AN INTERESTING THOUGHT. THAT'S ONE THING TO GET --
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. BASED ON THE ALGORITHM THAT I HAVE BEEN DRAWING ON THE BACK OF JESSICA'S JACKET, I HAVE HILLARY UP OVER 32 POINTS OVER ELIZABETH WARREN, AND BEATING MITT ROMNEY AND JEB BUSH BY SEVENS. CONGRATULATIONS, MADAME PRESIDENT.
WELL, JON. I THINK TONIGHT'S RESULTS MEAN THE DEMOCRATS DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO RUN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND SCOTT WALKER DEFEATS A TALKING RIFLE AND RAND PAUL'S JERRY CURL.
Jon: I DON'T --
I CAN'T -- I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS! I CAN'T -- I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE, JON.
AASIF, THAT'S A RIDICULOUS POINT.
JOHN, YOU'RE A RIDICULOUS POINT.
OH, DO I LOOK LIKE LIKE MY NAME IS JOHN HODGMAN? DO I LOOK LIKE A NERD GROWING TWO DIFFERENT PORN MUSTACHES ON THE SAME FACE?
JESSICA, I'M RIGHT HERE! I CAN HEAR YOU!
WE'RE OUT OF TIME. WE'RE OUT OF TIME.
Jon: OH THAT'S RIGHT! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS! WE'RE OUT OF TIME MEANS IT'S TIME FOR THE STACKS BOUNCE SEGMENT! WHERE ALL PUNDITS  ALL TALK AT THE SAME TIME WHILE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN! GREAT JOB! THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR THE STACK! GREAT JOB, GUYS. GREAT! REALLY VERTICAL! YOU WON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE ELSE, THE STACK! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! YES! THE STACK!
