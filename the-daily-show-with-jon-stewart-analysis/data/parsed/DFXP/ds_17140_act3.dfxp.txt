(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS A THREE-TIME OLYMPIC GOLD EDALIST IN BEACH VOLLEYBALL,M TAKING HOME GOLD IN LONDON WITH  HER PARTNER CARRIE WALSH JENNINGS, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MISTY MAY-TREANOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME!
THANK YOU. (CROWD CHANTING "U.S.A.")
IT DOESN'T GET OLD, BELIEVE ME. I WISH I COULD BOTTLE THAT SOUND LIKE, ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO  OPEN MY CAN OF "U.S.A.!"
Jon: GETS YOU EXCITED. FIRST THING I HAVE TO ASK YOU, HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ROBERT PATTINSON. (LAUGHTER) (WHISPERING) PLAY ALONG, YOUNG PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.
I THOUGHT IT WAS "THE HUNGER GAMES." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WAIT, DID WE HAVE ARCHERS THERE. DID WE HAVE CAT MISS THE ON THE BUS AT THE OLYMPICS?
NO, BUT I WATCH ARCHERY AND I LIVE IN LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA AND I ALWAYS GO BY THIS PARK  WITH ARCHERS AND I'M LIKE SO NOW I'M LIKE WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I THINK I SHOULD TAKE UP ANOTHER SPORT. SO I SHOULD GO ARCHERY BUT DRESS IN CHARACTER LIKE ROBIN HOOD. SOMETHING... EVERY TIME I TAKE A LESSON, LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TODAY? I'M KATNISS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE, I THINK, IN THE CALIFORNIA LIFE-STYLE AND NEW YORK. THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE A BOW AND ARROW IN A PARK... (LAUGHTER).
RIGHT?
Jon: LIKE, THE IDEA THAT... LIKE, WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO HAVE NERF FOOTBALLS IN NEW YORK.
YOU GET TICKETED ON THE BEACH NOW. KIDS...
Jon: FOR SHOOTING ARROWS.
THROWING FOOTBALLS IN CALIFORNIA, KIDS DIG A HOLE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A TICKET.
Jon: I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.
Jon: IT'S A NANNY STATE. IT'S GOT TO BE UNACCEPTABLE. LET ME ASK YOU THIS: THE WOMEN OF THE OLYMPICS, IF YOU JUST TOOK THE MEDALS THAT THE WOMEN  OF THE UNITED STATES WON IT WOULD BE THE THIRD LARGEST COUNTRY HAUL FOR THE ENTIRE THING. THE WOMEN DROVE US TO VICTORY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HAVE YOU SEEN... THIS IS... THIS WAS YOUR FOURTH OLYMPICS. HAVE YOU SEEN THE WOMEN GROW IN CONFIDENCE AND ABILITY? WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THAT SUCCESS TO?
OH, MY GOSH. I THINK... I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S TITLE 9 THAT HAPPENED. I WOULDN'T BE DOING WHAT I AM UNLESS THE WOMEN BEFORE ME GAVE US THAT FOUNDATION. BUT THE YOU LOOK, NO MATTER WHAT, SOCCER, VOLLEYBALL, SO MANY YOUNG KIDS ARE PLAYING. IT'S JUST THE AMOUNT OF YOUNG KIDS THAT ARE OUT THERE PLAYING HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY AND THAT  SAYS A LOT. BUT ALSO YOU SEE THE HARD WORK THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL ATHLETE ON THE FEMALE SIDE-- AND MALE  SIDE-- IS PUTTING INTO IT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, I THINK THE FEMALE SIDE. (LAUGHTER) FROM WHAT I SAW OF THE MALE SIDE IT WAS A LOT OF LIKE "WHAT TIME  DOES THE CLUB CLOSE?" (LAUGHTER) DID YOU SEE... THERE WAS ALWAYS  PICTURES OF LIKE "HERE'S THE BELGIAN CYCLIST. HE JUST URINATED ON HIMSELF." THERE'S LIKE... THEY'RE CARRYING HIM INTO A CAB. DO PEOPLE GO NUTS? LIKE, THIS IS YOUR FOURTH OLYMPICS, BUT DID YOU NOTICE PSYCHOTIC DISPLAYS OF LIKE "MY  EVENT IS OVER, I'M GOING TO RUIN EVERYTHING." (LAUGHTER)
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE OUR VENUE IS USUALLY PRETTY FAR FROM THE  OLYMPIC VILLAGE SO WE ALWAYS STAY UP UNTIL OPENING CEREMONIES AND EVERYBODY'S CALM, EVERYBODY'S TRAINING AND DOING THEIR THING AND THEN THE FUN OR THE CRAZINESS STARTS AFTER AND  WE'RE USUALLY AT A DIFFERENT VENUE. BUT, YOU KNOW IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE I'M READING THROUGH A MAGAZINE AND IT WASN'T ABOUT THE ATHLETES. IT WAS THE BODY ISSUE. IT HAD THE ATHLETES THERE AND YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THE HIGHLIGHT.
Jon: THE NAKED PICTURES.
EXACTLY. YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THE HIGHLIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT?
NO, IT WASN'T.
Jon: IT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT.
NO, IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL LOVE OF THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT THERE WERE WORDS ON THAT PAGE. AND I... (LAUGHTER). I'M GOING TO GO BACK NOW AND I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THOSE, BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS FASCINATING. (LAUGHTER)
AND I WAS LIKE COME ON, REALLY. AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CONDOMS AND HOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE AND THEY HAVE TO GET  MORE AND STUFF.
Jon: THERE WAS A CONDOM SHORTAGE? (LAUGHTER)
I GUESS SO.
Jon: IS THAT GLOBAL WARMING? (LAUGHTER) YOU HAVE DECIDED ENOUGH. WAS IT A... WAS THAT FOREMOST IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU'RE STANDING  ON THE MEDAL STAND AND YOU'VE GOT THAT GOLD? IS IT A FEELING OF RELIEF? IS IT A FEELING OF REYET? ARE YOU TEMPTED TO GO BACK? I'M SURE IT'S COMPLEX. YOU HAVE 30 SECOND. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, I THINK I'M READY. MY HUSBAND AND I WANT A FAMILY. THAT'S OUR PRIORITY.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU WANT? I CAN GET YOU THAT? (LAUGHTER)
WE PUT THAT ON HOLD SO I DON'T MIND THE CONDOM SHORTAGE. (LAUGHTER) RIGHT?
Jon: THE ONE ATHLETE IN THE VILLAGE. "YEAH, I'M OKAY." (LAUGHTER)
BUT, NO, FAMILY'S IMPORTANT AND I MADE THE CHOICE AND I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S TIME FOR ME TO DO OTHER THINGS. I WANT TO BE A WIFE. I WANT TO BE A MOM. I'M WORKING ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNS.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU... ARE YOU RUNNING FOR SOMETHING?
I COULD PROBABLY WIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: I THINK YOU COULD. I REALLY THINK YOU COULD. U.S.A., THAT'S FOR SURE. WHAT IS YOUR... I KNOW YOU HAVE ONE THING. WE'LL GET TO THAT.
SO I'M CURRENTLY DOING A CAMPAIGN CALLED "DITCH THE DRIP."
Jon: (LAUGHS) SORRY? (LAUGHTER)
DITCHTHEDRIP.COM. IT'S ABOUT SEASONAL ALLERGIES AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE SUFFER. I'M A SUFFERER AND IT'S ABOUT GOING TO YOUR DOCTOR AND GETTING  IT TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE YOU GET WORSE.
Jon: ALLERGIES.
ALLERGY SEASON COMING AROUND AGAIN.
Jon: BECAUSE I WAS LIKE PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT GONORRHEA.
BUT ALSO I LOVE WORKING WITH KIDS AND IT'S ABOUT GETTING THAT  NEXT GENERATION, WHICH IS WHY THE FEMALE ATHLETES DID SO WELL. IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE NEXT GENERATION...
Jon: PAYING IT FORWARD.
AND I LOVE SHARING MY KNOWLEDGE. SO THAT'S... THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.
Jon: IT'S WONDERFUL AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU, JUST THE  THRILLS AND THE EXCITEMENT YOU HAVE GIVEN AMERICANS LO THESE PAST FOUR OLYMPICS, WE WANT TO  THANK YOU. YOU GUYS WERE AMAZING.
THANK YOU. YOU WON'T SEE THE LAST OF ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WONDERFULLY DONE. MISTY MAY-TREANOR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
