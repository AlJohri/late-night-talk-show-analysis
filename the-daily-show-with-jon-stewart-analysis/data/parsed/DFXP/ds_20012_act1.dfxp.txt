FROM COMEDY  CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.
Jon; HEY WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MAN, I COULD  HAVE USED THIS GUY LAST NIGHT.   PROFESSOR BRYAN STEVENSON,  AUTHOR OF "JUST MERCY: A STORY OF JUSTICE AND REDEMPTION."  VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT FIRST, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU PEOPLE. I CAN'T DO IT. THIS HAS BEEN A LOUSY COUPLE OF WEEKS, YEARS, DECADES.  [BLEEP] DECADE. ENDLESS WAR, CORPORATIST SURVEILLANCE STATE THAT THRIVES ON SECRECY AND THE TEARS OF ORPHANS. AND NOW A ROVING HOARD OF ISLAMIST DECAPITATION FETISHISTS WHO ARE RACING AN AFRICAN BLOOD POOP VIRUS TO SEE WHICH CAN KILL US FIRST. SOMETIMES YOU WONDER, WHY GO ON? WHAT'S THE POINT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE POINT IS: IF WE GIVE INTO DISPAIR THEY WIN. WE MUST KEEP FIGHTING BECAUSE AS FRODO TAUGHT US, EVEN IF THE  WORLD IS HORSE [BLEEP], IF YOU  DIG AROUND LONG ENOUGH THERE IS  A PONY IN THERE SOMEWHERE.   WELL, IT TURNS OUT, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, I FOUND A PONY LAST  NIGHT IN FLORIDA.
WE ARE LIVE FROM BROWARD COLLEGE IN DAVIE, FLORIDA. WE HAVE GOVERNOR CHARLIE CRIST, FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT.\, OUR INCUMBENT GOVERNOR AND THE  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR  GOVERNOR IS ALSO IN THE  BUILDING.   GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT? WE HAVE  BEEN TOLD THAT GOVERNOR SCOTT  WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN  THIS DEBATE.
Jon:  HE CAN'T NOT  PARTICIPATE.   A DEBATE MUST HAVE AT LEAST TWO  PARTIES TO BE CONSIDERED A  DEBATE OTHERWISE IT'S A  MASTERBATE, IT'S JUST ONE.   PERHAPS GOVERNOR SCOTT IS JUST LATE.  MAYBE HE'S LATE.   PERHAPS THE HAIRLESS SERPENTINE INCUMBENT GOT SIDETRACKED LOOKING FOR A SNACK. OH LOOK AT HIM THERE. BUT IT WAS THE REASON FOR  GOVERNOR SCOTT'S ABSENCE THAT  REMINDED ME WHY LIFE IS SO  BEAUTIFUL.
GOVERNOR CRIST HAS ASKED TO  HAVE A FAN, A SMALL FAN PLACED  UNDERNEATH HIS PODIUM.   THE RULES OF THE DEBATE THAT I  WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTT CAMPAIGN  SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FAN. SOMEHOW THERE IS A FAN THERE AND FOR THAT REASON, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, I AM BEING TOLD THAT  GOVERNOR SCOTT WILL NOT JOIN US  FOR THIS DEBATE.
Jon: GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA HAS REFUSED TO DEBATE FORMER GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA CRIST BECAUSE FORMER GOVERNOR CRIST HAS A FAN THAT APPEARS TO BE  PROVIDING A SMALL AMOUNT OF  RESPITE FOR HIS PRESUMABLY  SWEATY BALLS.   THANK YOU, JESUS!   LOOK, WE ALL KNOW WHAT'S  HAPPENING HERE.   IT'S FLORIDA.   THERE'S A HUMID ENVIRONMENT IN  FLORIDA.   CRIST'S BOYS GOT SWEATY SO THE  FORMER GOVERNOR POPS DOWN AND  PICKS UP A FAN AT WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, BED, BALLS AND BEYOND. WHAT'S THE ISSUE?
THE FIRST QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU, GOVERNOR CRIST, IS WHY DID YOU INSIST ON BRINGING A FAN HERE?
WHY NOT? YOU KNOW, IT'S UH,  IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH BEING COMFORTABLE?
Jon: NOW THAT IS HOW YOU WIN VOTES IN FLORIDA. RIGHT NOW A MILLION ALTACOCKERS IN FLORIDA ARE TURNING TO THEIR FRIENDS GOING, I MEAN HE'S GOT A POINT,  YOU KNOW, YOU STAND ALL NIGHT IN THE LIGHTS, I MEAN HE SHOULD BE  COMFORTABLE, UH?   OF COURSE, THOSE OF YOU WHO  FOLLOW FLORIDA POLITICS OR HAVE  A GOOGLE ALERT SET FOR FLORIDA  BALL FAN CONTROVERSIES, WERE  WERE HARDLY SURPRISED BY THE SCANDAL.
THIS HAPPENED BACK IN 2006 AS WELL WHEN CRIST WAS RUNNING FOR  THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR  GOVERNOR. THERE WAS A DISPUTE OVER A FAN  THEN, TOO.  THEY ENDED UP SHARING THE FAN.
Jon:  OH!   SADLY THOSE DAYS OF BIPARTISAN  ACCOMMODATION ARE LONG GONE.   AND WHILE WE WERE ONCE A NATION  OF BALL FAN SHARERS, IN TODAY'S  DIVIDED POLITICS, WE WOULD  RATHER STEW IN OUR OWN  TESTICULAR MOISTURE THAN REACH  ACROSS THE AISLE TO BRING A  FRESH WIND OF COMPROMISE.   AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN HIMSELF ONCE SAID, A SCROTUM DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND FOR IT IS REALLY NOT A WEIGHT-BEARING, JUST REALLY JUST FLOPS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. OF COURSE, ALL WONDERFUL THINGS MUST COME TO AN END.   EVENTUALLY RICK SCOTT DID  APPEAR, ALLOWING FLORIDIANS TO  DISCUSS THE ISSUES THEY CARE  ABOUT MOST.
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE  VOTERS ARE SAYING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.   LET'S GO THE MANNIE GARCIA OF  THE NAPLES DAILY NEWS. AND   MANNIE, WHAT'S TRENDING ON  SOCIAL MEDIA RIGHT NOW?
WELL, THE FAN.
Jon:  IN FACT CHARLIE CRIST'S BALL TWITTER FEED HAS BEEN  BLOWING UP.   GUYS, THE FAN ISN'T SUPPOSED TO  HAVE FANS, SIDEWAYS WINKEY FACE, #GRUNDLE BRAG.   GRUNDLE BRAG? MY DAY WE CALLED THAT A TAINT. YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY. HONESTLY, WE COULD HAVE DELVED  IN TO ALL THE TERRIBLE ACTUAL  ANSWERS RICK SCOTT GAVE IN THE  DEBATE ABOUT HIS HORRIFYING  POLICIES FROM FLORIDA.   BUT THAT IS NOT NEARLY AS FUN AS HIM MISSING FOUR MINUTES OF A  DEBATE BECAUSE HIS OPPONENT HAD  A FAN POINTED AT HIS BALLS.   FOR MORE ON THIS STORY WE GO TO  SAMANTHA BEE IN FLORIDA.   SAM, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.   SAM, CAN YOU TELL US WHY RICK SCOTT REACTED SO STRONGLY TO CHARLIE CRIST'S EFFORTS TO COOL DOWN CHIP AND DALE, FOR LACK OF A BETTER --
JON, YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE.   FLORIDA POLITICS HAS A LONG  TRADITION OF AN ELECTORAL  BALL-COOLERY.   FROM THE INAUGURATION OF ANDREW  JACKSON AS THE STATE'S FIRST  GOVERNOR, TO THE 2000  PRESIDENTIAL RACE WHEN HUNDREDS  OF BROWARD COUNTY BALLOTS WERE  RENDERED INDECIPHERABLE DUE TO  COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF BALL SWEAT.
Jon:  REMIND ME AGAIN WHY  VOTERS IN FLORIDA IN THAT  ELECTION INSISTED ON WIPING THEIR BALLOTS ON THEIR BALLS?
WELL, I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE  BALLOTS WERE VERY POORLY  DESIGNED AND ALL THOSE OLD  PEOPLE GOT CONFUSED.   THEY INTENDED TO VOTE FOR AL  GORE AND INSTEAD THEY  ACCIDENTALLY STUCK THE BALLOTS  DOWN THEIR PANTS.
Jon:  I REMEMBER THAT.
YEAH.
Jon:  IS THIS A STATEWIDE  ISSUE, SAM?
WELL, NOT THE WHOLE STATE.   THIS AREA HERE IN THE SOUTH.
Jon:  RIGHT.
THIS AREA IS GENERALLY MORE  ARID.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THE PROBLEM REALLY COMES WHEN YOU'RE DOWN HERE WHEN YOU REACH UP IN THIS AREA. IT JUST GETS EXTREMELY DAMP AND SWAMPY AND JUST, JUST GROSS.
Jon: WHAT IF, WHAT IF, TO CLARIFY THAT, WHAT ABOUT CLEARING OUT SOME OF THE SWAMP LAND IN THAT AREA? WOULD THAT HELP?
OH, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DEFORESTATION?
Jon: DEFORESTATION.
YEAH, YEAH. IT WOULD, IT WOULD HELP COOL IT DOWN, BUT ULTIMATELY THERE'S THE  UPKEEP AND THEN ONCE THAT  FOLIAGE BEGINS TO GROW BACK,  IT'S ALSO SOMEHOW EVEN GROSSER.
Jon:  I GET IT. I GET IT.
YEAH. THE POINT IS, DON'T SHAVE  YOUR BALLS, JON.
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND.   SAM, WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
OH WELL, JON, RIGHT NOW I'M AT FLORIDA'S SCROTOGEN LABS WHERE THEY ARE WORKING NIGHT AND DAY TO COMBAT FLORIDIAN BALL SWEAT.
Jon:  AND HOW IS THE RESEARCH  COMING, SAM?
WELL LET ME SHOW YOU AN EARLY  PROTOTYPE.
Jon:  IS THAT -- SAM, IS THAT AN OPEN FAN ON THE INSIDE OF THE UNDERWEAR?  BECAUSE THAT SEEMS LIKE ANY COOLING  BENEFIT WOULD BE UNDERCUT BY  OBVIOUSLY THE MANGLING.
YEAH, WELL, AFTER YEARS OF  TRIALS, THEY HAVE COME TO THAT  SAME CONCLUSION.
Jon: SURE.
SO I GIVE YOU THE TESTI-COOL 5000.
Jon: IT SEEMS COMPLICATED FOR  UNDERWEAR.
YEAH, YOU GET USED TO IT. YOU GET USED TO IT.
Jon: THEY DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF COOLING IN A DEBATE ENVIRONMENT.
WELL, THERE IS ONE OTHER  OPTION IN DEVELOPMENT.   IT'S A VERTICAL VENTILATION OPEN PORT APERTURE.   IT OF COURSE is MANUALLY  OPERATED.
Jon:  SO BASICALLY YOUR  ADVICE WOULD BE KEEP YOUR FLY  OPEN.
WELL, I GUESS FOR THE LAYMAN, OKAY.
Jon: WELL, THANKS SO MUCH, SAM, GOOD LUCK DOWN THERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
