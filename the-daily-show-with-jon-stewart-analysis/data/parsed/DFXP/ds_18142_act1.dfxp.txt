John: WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL HERE FOR JON STEWART  WHO IS CURRENTLY PREPARING HIS  COSTUME FOR NEXT YEAR'S  CARNIVALE. HE LOOKS SPECTACULAR. (LAUGHTER)  OUR GUEST TONIGHT DIRECTOR OF  THE DOCUMENTARY "THE ACT OF  KILLING" JOSHUA OPPENHEIMER WILL BE WITH US. MAGNIFICENT FILM. (APPLAUSE)  WE START TONIGHT RIGHT HERE IN  NEW YORK CITY.
STOP AND FRISK IS A  CONTROVERSIAL TACTIC USED BY  POLICE IN BIG CITIES LIKE NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, AND  PHILADELPHIA. IN NEW YORK, IT'S BEEN POLICY  FOR 11 YEARS, DEFINED LIKE THIS:  A PERSON IS TEMPORARILY DETAINED ON THE STREET AGAINST HIS OR HER  WILL FOR THE PURPOSES OF  QUESTIONING.
John: THAT'S RIGHT, STOP  AND FRISK, NOT JUST THE TITLE OF  A '90s RIPOFF OF "TURNER AND HOOCH" ABOUT A COP WHOSE PARTNER  IS A CAT. THE MOVIE HAS SOME PROBLEMS ONCE  THE BAD GUYS REALIZE THEY CAN  COMPLETELY DISTRACT THE CAT WITH A LASER POINTER. DAMN IT, FRISK, FOCUS! I'VE ALMOST GOT IT, SARGE! (LAUGHTER)  FOR YEARS, OPINION IN NEW YORK  HAS BEEN DIVIDED ON --  (LAUGHTER). I'LL ALLOW IT. FOR YEARS, OPINION HAS BEEN  DIVIDED ON FRISK WITH BLACK AND  LATINO RESIDENTS OF THE CITY SAYING IT'S AN INVASION OF THEIR  LIBERTY AND WHITE REDENTS SAYING  "OH, I THINK I HEARD A THING ABOUT THAT ON NPR. IS THAT STILL HAPPEN?  ING". (LAUGHTER)  OBVIOUSLY, I DON'T MEAN TO  SUGGEST THAT IT'S ONLY USE  AGAINST THE CITY'S MINORITIES, BUT IT IS ALMOST THAT.
BETWEEN 2004 AND 2012 THERE  WERE 4.43 MILLION STOPS. 52% WERE BLACK SUSPECTS   3, 1%  WERE HISPANIC.
OF THESE THOUSANDS OF DAILY  FRISKS, ONLY 6% LEAD TO AN  ARREST.
John: IT'S BASICALLY LIKE  CATCH-AND-RELEASE FISHING EXCEPT  YOU GET TO FEEL THE FISH UP AND SHOUT AT IT A BIT BEFORE  THROWING IT BACK. ALSO, ALMOST ALL THE FISH ARE  BROWN. (LAUGHTER)  THIS POLICY HAS BEEN IN PLACE  FOR OVER A DECADE. BUT THERE MAY BE SOME GOOD NEWS  ON THE HORIZON IF YOU HAPPEN TO  BE A MINORITY WHO LIKES WALKING.
TODAY A FEDERAL JUDGE CALLED  THE N.Y.P.D.'S POLICY OF STOP,  QUESTION, AND FRISK  UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE JUDGE SAID THE CITY ADOPTED  A POLICY OF INDIRECT RACIAL  PROFILING.
John: IT'S INDIRECT RACIAL  PROFILING. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S LIKE A COP SAYING "SHOULD  WE FRISK PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE  APOLLO OR OUTSIDE THE JIMMY BUFFETT CONCERT? TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S FLIP A COIN  AND THEN HEAD UP TO HARLEM."  (LAUGHTER)  THE JUDGING RULING FOUND THE POLICE DISPROPORTIONATELY  TARGETED BLACK AND LATINO NEW  YORKERS CITING, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT BLACK NEW YORKERS ARE 20%  MORE LIKELY TO BE STOPPED FOR  FURTIVE MOVEMENTS EVEN THOUGH, SHE WRITES, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE  THAT BLACK PEOPLE'S MOVEMENTS  ARE OBJECTIVELY MORE FURTIVE THAN THE MOVEMENTS OF WHITE  PEOPLE! (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, LOOK, A JUDICIAL OPINION  IS NOT THE PROPER FORUM TO  DISCUS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHITE PEOPLE AND BLACK PEOPLE. ALLOW ME. WHITE PEOPLE REACH INTO THEIR  POCKETS LIKE THIS. HUH? BUT BLACK PEOPLE REACH INTO  THEIR POCKETS IN EXACTLY THE  SAME WAY. IT'S THE SAME. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT -- YES, BUT DESPITE ALL OF  THAT, THE JUDGE WASN'T SUGGESTING THE PROGRAM BE  ABANDONED COMPLETELY.
SHE HAS NOT ORDERED THE CITY  TO STOP DOING THIS PROGRAM. WHAT SHE'S ORDERED IT IS THE  CITY TO CHANGE HOW IT DOES IT. SHE WANTS A FEDERAL MONITOR TO  LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM. SHE WANTS TO GATHER MORE DATA ON  IT, WANTS IN SELECTED PRECINCTS  OFFICERS TO WEAR BODY CAMERAS WHEN TAE DO THESE STOP AND  FRISKS SO THAT COURT CANS GET A  BETTER IDEA OF HOW IT WORKS.
John: INTERESTINGLY, THAT  BODY CAMERA IDEA WASN'T  ORIGINAL, IT WAS ALREADY PROPOSED BY ONE OF THE MAYORAL  CANDIDATES. I WILL GIVE YOU ONE GUESS WHICH  ONE. (LAUGHTER)
SO AMONG MY PROPOSALS WERE  SUBSTANTIAL ONES ABOUT WHAT YOU  DO IN THE STOP STOP AND FRISK AIR ERA AND I PROPOSE LAPEL  CAMERAS FOR POLICE OFFICERS.
John: YOU HEARD RIGHT,  WEINER IS SUGGESTING BODY  CAMERAS FACING OUT. BY THE WAY, DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD  IT WAS FOR OUR RESEARCHERS TO  FIND THAT PARTICULAR CLIP? TRY GOOGLING "WEINER, BODY,  CAMERA" AND SEE HOW MANY HITS  YOU GET. LET'S BE FAIR, WYNNER IS TRYING  TO KEEP THE CITY FROM DANGER. CARLOS DANGER. ♪ DANGER, DANGER ♪  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  ONE PERSON WHO IS NOT HAPPY WITH  THE JUDGE'S RULING IS THE CURRENT MAYOR.
THROUGHOUT THE CASE WE DIDN'T  BELIEVE THAT WE WERE GETTING A  FAIR TRIAL AND THIS DECISION CONFIRMS THAT SUSPICION AND WE  WILL BE PRESENTING EVIDENCE OF  THAT UNFAIRNESS TO THE APPEALS  COURT.
John: HOLD ON. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU THINK THIS PROGRAM IS BEING  UNFAIRLY STOPPED AND SCRUTINIZED  EVEN THOUGH IT'S DONE NOTHING  WRONG? (LAUGHTER)  I THINK I KNOW MILLIONS OF  BLACKS AND LATINOS IN THIS CITY  WHO KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT BLOOMBERG ISN'T ALONE IN  BEING DISAPPOINTED. POLICE COMMISSIONER RAY KELLY  BELIEVE THERE IS A SIMPLE WAY  FOR STOP AND FRISK'S TARGET TO DEAL WITH IT.
THE BEST THING FOR SOMEONE TO  DO THAT'S BEING STOPD IS  COOPERATE. ACCEPT IT AS A FACT OF URBAN  LIFE. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
John: IT'S A FACT OF URBAN  LIFE. LIKE BIKE LANES OR ALTERNATIVE  PARKING OR YOUR NEIGHBOR LEAVING  HER LABRADOODLE (BLEEP) RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. (LAUGHTER)  I KNOW IT WAS YOU, TINA! PICK UP AFTER ROSCO! IT'S NOT ROSCO'S FAULT! THIS POLICY IS EASY TO IGNORE  FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE TO DEAL  WITH ITS CONSEQUENCES. BUT I'M CURIOUS, FOR THOSE THAT  DO, WHAT IS THIS FACT OF URBAN  LIFE REALLY LIKE?
POLICE START RUNNING AT WITH  US THEIR GUNS DRAWN SAYING  EVERYBODY GET ON THE FLOOR, NO GUN WAS FOUND, NOBODY WAS  ARRESTED.
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR NO I.D.,  THEY JUST SAID PUT YOUR HAND UP.
TOUCHED ME ALL OVER, EVEN IN  MY PRIVATE PARTS.
JUST GOING THROUGH MY  POCKETS, GOING UP, DOWN.
I'LL BREAK YOUR (BLEEP)ING  ARM.
FOR WHAT?
SHUT YOUR (BLEEP)ING MOUTH!
John: I ACTUALLY THINK I  GET IT NOW. FOR A MOMENT, LET ME ADDRESS THE  WHITE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW HOW WE FEEL AT THE  AIRPORT WHEN THE T.S.A. IS  PATTING US DOWN UNNECESSARILY DELAYING US LOOKING FOR WEAPONS  WHICH WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE  AND WE JUST TRY TO GET TO OUR  GATE? WELL, IMAGINE YOUR WHOLE  NEIGHBORHOOD IS TERMINAL "B" AT  LAGUARDIA. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE T.S.A. AGENTS SOMETIMES  TALK TO YOU LIKE THIS. "BOARDING PASS AND WHAT THE  (BLEEP) ARE YOU LOOKING AT? OPEN THAT COMPUTER BAG BEFORE I  BREAK YOUR ARM MOTHER  (BLEEP)ER!"  IRRITATING, ISN'T IT? A LITTLE IRRITATING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOR TURN WE TURN TO SENIOR DAILY  SHOW CORRESPONDENT JESSICA  WILLIAMS. JESSICA, AS SOMEONE WHO IS MORE  LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS  THAN I AM, DO YOU AGREE THAT STOP AND FRISK GOES TOO FAR?
NO! I AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER KELLY. IF ANYTHING, STOP AND FRISK  DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH! JOHN, PEOPLE NEED TO ACCEPT THIS  PROGRAM AS A FACT OF URBAN LIFE. AND RIGHT NOW I'M STANDING IN  ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST  CRIME-RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOODS.
John: WHERE EXACTLY ARE  YOU, JESS?
I'M ON WALL STREET. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT? YOU'RE ON WALL STREET?
YEAH, I'M ON WALL STREET. THE WHITE BRONX, BUSINESS  HARLEM. AND FRANKLY, JOHN, I DON'T FEEL  SAFE HERE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE  POLICE DO THEIR FREAKING JOBS  AND START STOPPING PEOPLE DOWN  HERE.
John: THAT'S NOT FAIR. THAT'S NOT FAIR, JESSICA. YOU'RE CALLING FOR THE ARBITRARY  HARASSMENT OF ANYONE ON WALL  STREET.
NO, NO, NO. JUST PEOPLE YOU SUSPECT TO BE  WHITE COLLAR CRIMINALS. YOU KNOW, WALKING AROUND IN  TAILORED SUITS, SLICKED BACK  HAIR, ALWAYS NEED SUNSCREEN, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. (LAUGHTER).
John: I DON'T LIKE THE  IMPLICATION THERE.
LOOK, I KNOW THIS ISN'T  COMFORTABLE BUT IF YOU DON'T  WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WHITE-COLLAR CRIME MAYBE YOU  SHOULDN'T DRESS THAT WAY! BOOM!
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. I DON'T LIKE THAT. THAT'S RACIST. JESSICA, THAT IS RACIST. YOU'RE PROFILING WHITE MEN IN  SUITS. I AM A WHITE MAN IN A SUIT.
HEY, IT'S OKAY. I CAN SAY THAT. SOME OF MY BEST FRIEND ARE WHITE  MEN IN SUIT.
John: THAT'S A FOUL.
THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH IT. AND SURE, THE SYSTEM IS NOT  PERFECT. 90% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STOPPED  WON'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG. BUT ISN'T IT WORTH A SLIGHT  INCONVENIENCE TO THEIR DAY IF IT  MEANS JUST STOPPING ONE INVESTMENT BANK FROM BETTING  AGAINST THE SAME PRODUCT IT'S  SELLING?
John: NO, NO, JESSICA, CAN  I TELL YOU THIS? YOU ARE MERELY PERPETUATE AGO  NEGATIVE STEREOTYPE. THAT'S IGNORANCE. THAT'S ALL THAT IS. (LAUGHTER)
JOHN, I HATE TO SAY IT  BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN THEIR  NEIGHBORHOODS OR EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEMS SPECIFIC TO THEIR  LIVES.
John: THAT'S RIGHT, YOU  DON'T. YOU DON'T.
BUT IT IS A HARD FACT THAT  WHITE-COLLAR CRIME IS  DISPROPORTIONATELY COMMITTED BY PEOPLE FIT A SERB PROFILE.
John: HEY, HEY --
SO IF YOU'RE SAY WHITE UPPER  EAST SIDE BILLIONAIRE WITH TIES  TO THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY LIKE MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, YOU'VE JUST  GOT TO ACCEPT GETTING ROUGHED UP  BY THE POLICE EVERY ONCE IN A  WHILE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU KNOW, FOR EVERYONE'S SAFETY.
John: JESSICA WILLIAMS,
