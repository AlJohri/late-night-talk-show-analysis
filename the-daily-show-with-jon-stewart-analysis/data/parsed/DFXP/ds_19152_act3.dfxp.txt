Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, HIS LATEST IS PBS'S "THE ROOSEVELTS: AN INTIMATE HISTORY."
THEY BELONGED TO DIFFERENT PARTIES. THEY OVERCAME DIFFERENT OBSTACLES. THEY HAD DIFFERENT TEMPERMENTS AND STYLES OF LEADERSHIP. BUT IT WAS THE SIMILARITIES AND NOT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO THAT MEANT THE MOST TO HISTORY. BOTH WERE CHILDREN OF PRIVILEGE WHO CAME TO SEE THEMSELVES AS CHAMPIONS OF THE WORKING MAN AND EARNED THE UNDYING ENMITY OF MANY OF THOSE AMONG WHOM THEY'D GROWN TO MANHOOD. THEY SHARED A SENSE OF STEWARTSHIP OF THE AMERICAN LAND, AN UNFAMED LOVE FOR PEOPLE AND POLITICS.
Jon: PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT COLORED SHIRTS BACK THEN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULDN'T. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM KEN BURNS. TAKE IT IN, TAKE IT IN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) KEN BURNS, IN A CAREER OF (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) KEN BURNS, IN A CAREER OF WONDERFUL FILMS, THIS IS-- I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THE PINNACLE BECAUSE YOU WILL PROBABLY GO HIGHER. BUT THIS IS A REMARKABLE PIECE OF WORK.
THESE ARE THREE GREAT PEOPLE THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE AROUND THIS KIND OF FOLK AND CALIBER TODAY. AND THEY WERE AMAZING LEADERS AND THEY WERE ALL FOR THE IDEA THAT WHEN WE ALL DO WELL, WE ALL DO WELL.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING, YOU BRING UP, WE DON'T HAVE THIS CALIBER OF LEADER ANY MORE. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT WE PROBABLY MAKE THESE KIND OF PEOPLE. BUT WE DESTROY THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT. WE DON'T-- I'M WRONG. WE DON'T SELECT FOR THEM.
Jon: YES.
WE THINK THAT HEROES HAVE TO BE PERFECT AND WHEN WE DISCOVER THE FIRST FLAW WE'RE LIKE THE SKY IS FALLING, LINDSEY GRAHAM.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT WHEN WE DISCOVER... (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS INCREDIBLE...
Jon: HOW WOULD TEDDY ROOSEVELT BE KNOCKED DOWN AND NOT BE ELECTABLE TODAY?
WELL, HE'S TOO HOT FOR THIS COOL MEDIUM OF TELEVISION. YOU KNOW, HE WOULDN'T MAKE IT OUT OF IOWA BECAUSE HE'D HAVE TEN HOWARD DEAN MOMENTS A DAY, YOU KNOW. DELIGHTED! AND HE WOULDN'T DO IT...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT OBVIOUSY IS IN A WHEELCHAIR SO HE COULDN'T LIFT US UP THROUGH THE DEPRESSION AND GET US THROUGH THE SECOND WORLD WAR, THE TWO GREAT CRISES OF THE CIVIL WAR. I THINK WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT HEROISM IS ACTUALLY THIS NEGOTIATION, SOMETIMES EVEN A WAR BETWEEN A PERSON'S VERY OBVIOUS STRENGTHS AND THEIR MAYBE NOT SO OBVIOUS WEAKNESSES. AND IT IS THAT NEGOTIATION THAT DEFINES HEROISM. AND THEN WE'RE JUST READY TO THROW THEM OUT THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE ONE STEP SHORT OF PERFECTION.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND OF COURSE THAT MEANS THERE IS NOBODY OUT THERE THAT WE COULD TRUST. BUT YOU MEET THESE PEOPLE. ALL OF THE ISSUES OF THEIR DAY ARE THE ISSUES OF OUR DAY. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT? WHAT IS THE NATURE OF LEADERSHIP? HOW DO YOU BALANCE IDEALISM AND PRAGMATISM, THIS IS THE STUFF OF NOW. AND ELEANOR IS DEALING WITH THINGS WITH WOMEN AND POVERTY...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND CHILDREN AND IMMIGRATION AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AND SHE'S RIGHT ON ALL OF THESE THINGS AND SHE'S 30 YEARS EARLY, 40 YEARS, 50 YEARS. WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES. AND SO I THINK THAT IN MANY WAYS, THEIR LIVES, AS DEEP FLAWED AS ALL THREE OF THEM ARE, AS DEEPLY WOUNDED. AND THEY ALL HAD TO ESCAPE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THESE CHILDHOOD WOUNDS, THEY REMAIN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER IN PUTTING SOME SORT OF PANTHEON...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND REMEMBER HOW THEY DEALT WITH STUFF.
Jon: I'M STRUCK BY THE AUDACITY OF EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE SPECTACULAR FAILURES.
YES.
Jon: THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THAT WAS THE POLITICAL OR THE PRAGMATIC.
RIGHT.
Jon: THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH VARIOUS CHECKS ON PRESIDENT POWER. BUT THE AUDACITY OF WHAT THEY WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH IS VERY STRIKING, AND HOW THEY USED THE PRESIDENTIAL PULPIT, YOU KNOW, WE LEARN A LOT ABOUT WELL, YOU CAN'T, THROUGH CONGRESS...
RIGHT.
Jon: AND EVERYBODY. MAN, TEDDY ROOSEVELT WENT AFTER BIG BUSINESS. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, GOOD, HATE ME, I DON'T CARE.
YES, EXACTLY. THE MALEFACTORS OF GREAT WEALTH.
Jon: RIGHT.
I WELCOME YOUR HATRED.
Jon: RIGHT.
NO, NO, AND HE'S ONE OF, AND THEN THE GREAT THING IS THE FLEXIBILITY. HE TURNS AROUND, FRANKLIN TURNS AROUND AFTER MAKING ENEMIES ALL THROUGH THE '30s AND SAYS, HEY, GUESS WHAT, I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU A LOT OF MONEY. YOU NEED TO OUTPRODUCE EVERYBODY ELSE AND BY THE END OF WORLD WAR II MORE THAN 50% OF ALL THE MANUFACTURING IS HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT'S FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SAYING NOPE, 5,000 PLANES IS NOT ENOUGH THIS YEAR, I NEED 50,000 PLANES, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU WILL DO IT, AND THEY DID DO IT. AND IT WAS BECAUSE YOU HAD SOMEBODY SAYING YOU WILL DO IT. IT IS THAT AUDACITY. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM SO REMARKABLE. THE KEY IS FEAR. ALL OF THEM HAD TO FACE FEAR IN SOME WAY.
Jon: RIGHT. WELL, TEDDY HAD THE HEALTH ISSUES AS A CHILD, HE WAS AN ASTHMATIC.
HEALTH AND UNBELIEVABLE TRAGEDY. HIS WIFE AND HIS MOTHER...
Jon: RIGHT.
DIED ON THE SAME DAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ON 20th STREET.
Jon: RIGHT. IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY, RIGHT?
IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST HORRIBLE. AND HE WAS HIMSELF SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEPRESSION. HE CAME FROM A FAMILY OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND ALCOHOLISM. AND SO HE SAID BLACK CARE CAN RARELY SIT BEHIND A RIDER WHOSE PACE IS FAST ENOUGH, WHICH IS A NICE 19th CENTURY WAY OF SAYING YOU CAN OUTRUN YOUR DEMONS.
Jon: WOW.
AND HIS FAVORITE NIECE ELEANOR WAS THE SAME WAY. THEY WERE IN CONSTANT MOTION, WHICH MAKES FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT EVEN MORE SPECTACULAR BECAUSE WHEN HE COULD LONGER TAKE A STEP, UNAIDED.
Jon: RIGHT.
HE'S, HE CAN'T OUTRUN ANY DEMONS. HE'S STILL WILLING TO FACE THAT FEAR IN THE BEST SORT OF WAY. AND ELEANOR HAS THIS HORRIBLE CHILDHOOD. YOU KNOW, BOTH PARENTS ARE GONE BY THE TIME SHE'S TEN. SHE'S WITH REPRESSIVE, PIOUS RELATIVES THAT WITH TWO, WITH A AN ABUSIVE NURSE AND TWO ALCOHOLIC UNCLES. AND SHE IS A FEARFUL PERSON WHO DECIDES TO WAKE UP EVERY DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY OF HER LIFE AND FACE THE FEAR.
RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
AND WHICH IS AN AMAZING, AMAZING THING.
I MEAN, I THINK THE LESSON HERE IS RELATIVELY CLEAR IN THAT WE HAVE BEEN TREATING OUR CHILDREN TOO WELL.
YES. RIGHT. EXACTLY.
AND THAT IF WE WANT GREATNESS.
WE NEED TO HAVE TRAGEDY. >>Jon: WE NEED TO ABANDON.
AND CORPORAL PUNISHMENT.
Jon: WILL YOU, WILL YOU STICK AROUND.
YEAH.
Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE PROJECT AND HOW YOU WENT ABOUT CREATING IT. BECAUSE IT IS, I MEAN, IT'S MAGNIFICENT. IT'S ALREADY RUNNING NOW ON PBS.
YEAH. STARTED LAST NIGHT.
BIGGER RATINGS THAN ANYTHING BUT FOOTBALL. AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE FOOTBALL. I THINK, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE FOOTBALL. 7-PART ROOSEVELT SERIES, IT'S RUNNING AT 8:00 P.M. ON PBS EACH NIGHT THIS WEEK THROUGH SATURDAY. AND THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE ROOSEVELTS: AN INTIMATE HISTORY." IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW AS WELL. KEN BURNS, EVERYBODY.
