Jon:  WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH CHRISTINE  AMANPOUR. HERE'S THE DEAL. HERE'S WHY I THINK WE'RE SUCH  NAIVE CHILDREN OVER HERE. I KNOW-- I WATCH THE GOVERNMENT,  AND I FEEL LIKE OUR  PROBLEM-SOLVING SYSTEM IS SO DYSFUNCTIONAL RIGHT NOW. AND I TRULY DO BELIEVE IN THE  PRESS' POWER TO BE THE  CLARIFYING-- HAVE A CLARIFYING ROLE IN THAT NONSENSE.
I DO. WE WERE JUST TALKING, THERE'S  SUCH MASSIVE ISSUES, WHETHER  IT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER GUN CONTROL OR WHETHER  IT'S ABOUT SYRIA OR WHETHER IT'S  ABOUT GUANTANAMO BAY. ALL OF THESE THINGS NEED  DISCUSSING IN A WAY THAT'S NOT  ONE SIDE'S TALKING POINTS AGAINST ANOTHER. REAL FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT  YOU CAN THEN DECIDE ONE WAY OR  ANOTHER, BUT HASH THEM OUT. PUT ALL THESE, YOU KNOW, REAL  ISSUES ON THE TABLE AND TALK  ABOUT THEM. AND NOT JUST ONE POLITICAL  FOOTBALL AFTER THE OTHER. AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS WHERE THE --
WHAT TYPE OF WIZARDRY DO YOU  SPEAK, WOMAN?
I SPEAK CNN WISDOM.
Jon:  DON'T MAKE THE SUN  GO AWAY! DON'T! DON'T DO IT! BUT WHY IS THAT SO DIFFICULT TO  DO? WHY DO THE ENTRENCHED TALKING  POINT POWERS HAVE SUCH A SWAY��  OVER THE CONVERSATION? IS IT PURELY THAT THEY BELIEVE  THAT THAT CONFLICT IS THE MOST  INTERESTING AND BENEFICIAL?
I THINK POSSIBLY. BUT, AGAIN, I URGE YOVr TO KEEP  WATCHING CNN, AND THERE IS MUCH  MORE INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION GOING ON. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY --
TELL ME WHAT TIME. BAZ I DO WATCH IT. IN BETWEEN WHEN AND WHEN?
FROM MORNING TO NIGHT.
Jon:  OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE WATCHING  CNN?
I'M ON IT, I'M ON IT.
Jon:  YOU ARE ON IT. HERE'S THE CRAZIESTING THING. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SYRIAN  THING. APPARENTLY ISRAEL HAS NO BOMBED  SYRIA, AND NOW NO ONE KNOWS WHAT  TO MAKE OF THAT, BECAUSE THE SYRIAN REBELS THINK GREAT, THAT  WEAKENS ASSAD AND THAT HELPS US  BUT WE HATE THOSE GUYS. OVER THERE IT SEEMS LIKE THE  ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS STILL  CIEMED OF MY ENEMY.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTE RIGHT ABOUT  THAT. IN THIS HUGE CONUNDRUM THAT  DEVELOPED OVER THE WEEKEND,  BASICALLY ISRAEL HAD ITS OWN RED LINE AND IT DECIDED ONCE IT HAD  BEEN CROSSED IT WAS GOING TO  TAKE ACTION SO ISRAEL BOMBED WHAT IT SAYS WERE A BUNCH OF  ADVANCED WEAPONS IN-- YOU KNOW,  SYRIAN MILITARY SITE COMING FROM IRAN TO HEZBOLLAH AND THAT'S THE  ESTABLISHED ROUTE. AND ISRAEL SAID, NO, WE'RE NOT  GOING TO ALLOW THAT, BUT WE'RE  NOT GET, INVOLVED IN SYRIA ON THE SIDE OF THE REBELS OR�i  AGAINST ASSAD. WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE CARE OF  THIS BUSINESS.
Jon:  HOLY SMOKES.
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID.
Jon:  IF YOU THINK OF  THIS IN TERMS OF SAUDI, TURKEY,  AND SAUDI ARABIA, DO THEY SECRETLY WATCH THAT AND OONG  BECAUSE THAT WEAKENS IRAN AND  THEY'RE KIND OF HAVING A POWER BATTLE THERE.
THEY CAN NEVER SAY, THAT BUT  I THINK MANY COUNTRIES WOULD  PREFER NOT TO SEE IRAN  EMPOWERED. THE FALL OF THE ASSAD REGIME IS  THAT WILL COMPLETE COMPLOOETLY  CRIPPLE HEZBOLLAH MILITARILY.
Jon:  THEN YOU GET INTO  THESE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENTS. AMERICA, WE'RE A SPREADER OF  FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. THAT'S WHAT WE SPREAD.
YUP. THAT'S A GOOD THING.
Jon:  EGYPT GETS A LITTLE  TASTE OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY  AND THEY VOTE IN PEOPLE WOE DON'T LIKE, AND THEY SWHAIRKS  ARE YOU DOING? AND IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE  TRANSITION. THE ARAB SPRING IS GOING TO BE  BUMPY. DON'T WE HAVE TO BE PATIENT?
I THINK IT WILL BE BUMPY AND  I THINK PEOPLE ARE PATIENT. TO BE FAIR, THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY STARTED  OFF AND PERHAPS STILL IS  SUPPORTING THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THE EGYPTIAN  GOVERNMENT, DESPITE THE CHAOS ON  THE STREET-- AND YOU'VE HAD BASAM YOUSEFF, WHO IS THE BEST,  THEY ARE STILL KEEPING  AGREEMENTS WITH THE U.S., WITH  ISRAEL. OBVIOUSLY IT'S REALLY ROCKY AND  IT'S REALLY BUMPY.
Jon:  AND IF THEY TURN TO  TYRANNY HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GET  OVERTHROWN. IT'S VERY INTERESTING. I'M GOING TO START WATCHING THE  INTERNATIONAL SHOW.
DO, DO.
Jon:  BECAUSE I REALLY.
THE WHOLE THING.
Jon:  DID YOU HEAR THERE  WAS A CRUISE SHIP, RIGHT, AND  EVERYONE HAD DIEXPRAE THEY FOLLOWED IT FOR--
YOU'RE VERY BAD.
Jon:  GL AND THEY LEFT IT  IN ALABAMA AND THERE'S A GUY  THERE WITH A HELICOPTER... CHRISTINE AMANPOUR, SHE'S THE  BEST.
