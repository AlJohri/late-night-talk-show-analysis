FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE. FROM THE NEW FILM "12 YEARS A SLAVE" WHICH IS A PHENOMENAL FILM MICHAEL FASSBENDER IS JOINING US TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS AS ALWAYS TIME FOR OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF. â™ª  -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE BUILT THAT OPEN I WAS WORRIED MAYBE WE WOULDN'T USE IT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY -- [LAUGHTER] -- HOW MUCH MONEY IT WAS GOING TO COST AND NOW I'M WORRIED THAT 2013 IS GOING TO BE LIMITING. [ LAUGHTER ] A LOT OF OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE CAPITOL HILL AND THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS BUT THE PRESIDENT IS ALSO A PLAYER IN ALL OF THIS. WHAT IS HIS MIND SET WITH REGARD TO ACCEDING TO REPUBLICAN DEMANDS. SEE IF YOU CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF HIS RING AND INDEX FINGER.
I'M NOT BUDGING WHEN IT COMES TO THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M GOING TO REPEAT IT. THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATIONS OVER THIS.
Jon: IF I WAS ON DEAL OR NO DEAL, I WOULD SAY NO DEAL. HEY, HEY IF I WAS ON LET'S MAKE A DEAL, NO DEAL. HEY, IF I WAS ON DEAL OF FORTUNE, I WOULD SAY ISN'T THIS SHOW CALLED WHEEL OF FORTUNE, STILL -- NO DEAL. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND NO OR NOOO, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN A COLORFUL ANALOGY.
WHEN YOU ARE AT THE PLANT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR JOB DO YOU EVER SAY TO YOUR BOSS, UNLESS I GET A RAISE RIGHT NOW AND MORE VACATION PAY, I'M GOING TO JUST SHUTDOWN THE PLANT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M PRETTY SURE YOU JUST DESCRIBED A UNION STRIKE. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT'S POINT IS YOU CAN'T PUNISH EVERYBODY BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.
THE REPUBLICANS WOULDN'T TAKE THE PRESIDENT'S USE OF  METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE LYING DOWN. METAPHORICALLY. THEY SEE YOUR VIVID IMAGERY AND RAISE YOU A TRIP TO KINKOS FOR SENATOR TOM COBURN.
JUST FOR A MINUTE I'D LIKE FOR US TO CONSIDER AND I'D ASK FOR UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO HAVE SCISSORS ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE A POINT IN A MINUTE.
Jon: I WOULD LIKE PERMISSION TO USE SCISSORS? THAT IS THE BEST EVIDENCE YET THAT OUR CONGRESS FUNCTIONS AT A KINDERGARTEN LEVEL. BUT NO, CONTINUE.
WE'RE $30 TRILLION IN THE HOLE PLUS ANOTHER $17 TRILLION IN DEBT.
ACTUALLY WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS WE SHOULD CUT THIS CREDIT CARD UP WHICH IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I VOTE. I THINK IT'S TIME WE QUIT BORROWING MONEY. ACTUALLY I THINK I'LL JUST TEAR IT UP. TIME WE QUIT BORROWING MONEY -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? [LAUGHTER] DO YOU KNOW HOW ANGRY THE GIANT WHOSE CREDIT CARD THAT IS IS GOING TO BE? FIEE, FIE, FO, [BLEEP] I NEEDED TO BUY CARGO PANTS. GIANT VOICE. ANGRY GIANT ASIDE I'M PRETTY SURE CUTTING UP THE COUNTRY'S CREDIT CARD DOESN'T MAKE THE DEBT GO AWAY. YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY IT. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT LIKE CURSED MEDALLIONS WHERE YOU DESTROY IT AND IT LOSES ALL ITS POWER. THEY STILL FIND YOU. ACTUALLY FOR THE SINGLE BEST ILLUSTRATION OF WHO THE REPUBLICANS THINK THEY ARE IN THIS FIGHT VS. WHO THEY ACTUALLY ARE, GOES TO SENATOR MIKE LEE OF UTAH.
SUPPOSING YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE HAVING BEEN INFORMED BY YOUR SPOUSE THAT YOU NEED TO BRING HOME BREAD, MILK AND EGGS.
Jon: YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE A FAMILY MAN RUNNING ERRANDS FOR FRENCH TOAST DAY. WHAT COULD BE MORE WHOLESOME.
WE WON'T ALLOW TO YOU BUY JUST BREAD, MILK AND EGGS. IN ORDER TO BUY THESE ITEMS AT THIS STORE, WE'LL REQUIRE YOU TO PURCHASE A HALF TON OF IRON ORE, A BUCKET OF NAILS, A BOOK ABOUT COWBOY POETRY AND A BARRY MANILOW ALBUM.
Jon: YOU ARE A FAMILY MAN RUNNING ERRANDS FOR FRENCH TOAST DAY FORCED TO BUY POETRY AND GAYISH MUSIC. YOU ARE SAYING PEOPLE IN CONGRESS ARE FORCED TO PAY FOR SOME STUFF THEY DON'T WANT AND THAT'S NOT FAIR. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S CALLED BEING IN A COUNTRY WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EXACTLY YOU. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AT THAT STORE. EVERYBODY CHIPPED IN AND GAVE YOU THE MONEY TO GO TO THE STORE TO BUY MILK, BREAD AND EGGS YOU DECIDED ON YOUR OWN THAT YOU DON'T LIKE EGGS, EGGS ARE A COMMUNIST MENACE TURNING OUR COUNTRY MUSLIM SO I'M GOING TO JUST BUY MILK AND BREAD. EVERYBODY IS LIKE WE PASSED THE LAW THAT SAID WOULD YOU BUY MILK, BREAD, AND EGGS AND THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD THAT SHOPPING LIST AND THAT'S WHEN YOU BURN THE (bleep) STORE DOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IS THERE ANY WAY OUT OF THIS MESS?
THERE'S ALSO, I THINK A LARGE CONTINGENT OF REPUBLICANS WHO EVEN IF THEY WERE TO VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE WOULD VOTE TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT. T
THERE ARE WELL OVER 100 WHO ARE FED UP WITH THE POLICY.
THERE WOULD BE 150 VOTES IF IT WERE A SECRET BALLOT.
Jon: 180 IF THEY COULD WRITE FAKE NAMES. CONGRESSMAN DICK HERTZ VOTES AYE. IF ALL THESE REASONABLE REPUBLICANS WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING, WHY DON'T THEY?
SO EVEN WHEN THEY WANT A DEAL, THEY NEED COVER BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO GET A PRIMARY ON THE RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT MAYBE 50 DIE HARD CONSERVATIVES IN THE HOUSE AND 150 REPUBLICANS TERRIFIED OF BEING PRIMARIED BY ONE OF THOSE.
Jon: SO THEY ARE WILLING TO LET PEOPLE LOSE THEIR GOVERNMENT PAYCHECK SO THAT THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR GOVERNMENT PAYCHECK. WE TURN TO CAPITOL HILL BUREAU CHIEF AL MADRIGAL. -- THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THIS SEEMS CRAZY. WHY ARE THESE MODERATE REPUBLICANS HIDING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS?
MAYBE THEY ARE AFRAID OF BEING JUDGED BY FRIENDS, COLLEAGUES, AFRAID OF NOT BEING ACCEPTED FOR WHO THEY ARE.
Jon: JUDGED FOR WHAT, FOR BEING MODERATE?
THEY PREFER THE TERM BIPARTISAN CURIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THERE'S WAY MORE OF THEM THAN YOU REALIZE, JON.
Jon: IF THEY AREN'T OPEN ABOUT POLITICAL ORIENTATION, HOW DO THEY FIND EACH OTHER?
THEY USE AN APP CALLED VOTR.
Jon: VOTR?
WITHOUT THE E, YOU SIGN UP AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE REPUBLICANS CAN SEE YOUR PROFILE AND DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO MEET UP. [ LAUGHTER ] I DO A LOT OF ZUMBA SO I --
Jon: YEAH, YEAH BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE YOU BUT WITH BETTER -- WHAT DO YOU USE THAT APP FOR?
IT HELPS ME FIND MEN WHO WILL (bleep) ME. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHO DON'T WANT TO RUN THROUGH THE DEBT CEILING. IT'S FISCALLY SAFE SEX, JOHN.
Jon: AL, CAN'T THIS GROUP OF CLOSETED REPUBLICANS UNDERSTAND IT'S 2013. IT'S COOL. MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD RESPECT THEM MORE IF THEY MADE RESPECTHE CHOICE BE OPENLYMADE RESPONSIBLE.
JON, IT'S NOT A CHOICE IT'S WHO YOU ARE. YOU ARE EITHER BORN RESPONSIBLE OR YOU ARE NOT.
Jon: THAT'S (bleep) AL. RESPONSIBILITY IS SOMETHING TAUGHT AND LEARNED OVER TIME. IF PEOPLE WERE BORN RESPONSIBLE BABIES WOULDN'T NEED DIAPERS, THEY WOULD JUST CLIMB UP ON THE TOILET AND ENJOY A RELAXING READ LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. SO YOU ARE SAYING THE REPUBLICANS ARE JUST BEING BABIES AND POOPING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY COULD CHOOSE TO GROW UP AND BE RESPONSIBLE.
Jon: IT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, AL.
THOSE (bleep). WHEN I GET ON VOTR LATER I'LL GIVE THE RESPONSIBLE REPUBLICANS A PIECE OF MY MIND AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?
Jon: WHAT? I'M GONNA [BLEEP] THEM
