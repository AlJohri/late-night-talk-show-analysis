FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU ON  THIS EVENING. VERY, VERY GOOD SHOW FOR YOU. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A YOUNG MAN  NAMED RICKY GERVAIS  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   HE'S HERE TO PROMOTE... HE'S HERE TO PROMOTE I THINK A NEW  LINE OF RICKY GERVAIS BLACK  TEE-SHIRTS-WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE HIM AND CREATINE. BEFORE WE START, THIS IS  INCREDIBLE. A HUGE BREAK COMING OUT OF  BOSTON.
THIS IS CNN'S BREAKING NEWS. WOLF, WE HAVE INFORMATION AN  ARREST HAS BEEN MADE IN THE  INVESTIGATION HERE IN BOSTON.
THE SUSPECT WAS IDENTIFIED  HAS NOW BEEN ARRESTED.
I WAS TOLD BY A BOSTON LAW  ENFORCEMENT SOURCE WE GOT HIM.
Jon: [BLEEP] I CAN'T... YOU  KNOW, SO MANY PEOPLE, THIS IS SO  IMPORTANT. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE  READING THIS TONIGHT. GIVE ME THE DETAILS. THIS IS EXCITING.
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  SOURCE SAYS AN ARREST HAS BEEN  MADE BASE ON TWO DIFFERENT VIDEOS SHOWING IMAGES OF THE  SUSPECT. THE VIDEO ENHANCEMENT SHOWED A  DARK-SKINNED MALE PLACING THE  PACKAGE AT THE SECOND ETION PLOATION SITE AND BACKING AWAY
Jon: DARK SKINNED MALE. BOY, WOW. HOW DID THEY NARROW THAT DOWN? THAT COULD BE ANYBODY FROM  DENNIS RODMAN TO GEORGE  HAMILTON. I MEAN, HE COULD STILL... OR  MAYBE BROOKLYN ASSEMBLYMAN. SO, BOY, THAT'S... WOW. BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY HAD A  TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF  INFORMATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY...
WE'RE GETTING SOME EXCLUSIVE  INFORMATION FROM CNN'S JOHN  KING. YOU'RE WORKING YOUR SOURCES. YOU'RE GETTING MORE INFORMATION. EXCLUSIVE REPORTING. YOU HEARD THIS DRAMATIC  EXCLUSIVE REPORTING THAT JOHN  HAS DONE NOW.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT?
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS WHY YOU TURN TO CNN IN A  CRISIS. YOU KNOW, WE MAKE FUN OF THEM  SOMETIMES. WE DO. WE TELL JOKES AT THEIR EXPENSE. BUT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY'VE  GOT THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND  THEY CAN DO THE REPORTING, YOU KNOW, AS ONE OF THEIR  COMPETITORS I GUESS WE JUST GET  A LITTLE JEALOUS. OF THESE KINDS OF EXCLUSIVES. ALTHOUGH WE SOON LEARNED THERE  WAS A VERY GOOD REASON WHY THIS  WAS EXCLUSIVE.
THERE HAS BEEN NO ARREST. AND, IN FACT, A SUSPECT HAS NOT  BEEN IDENTIFIED BY NAME YET.
Jon: OH, IT'S EXCLUSIVE  BECAUSE IT WAS COMPLETELY [BLEEP] WRONG. THAT'S WHY. IT WAS EXCLUSIVE. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY DID ANY OF  YOUR SOURCES END THEIR TIP-OFF  TO YOU WITH THE PHRASE "BA-BA-BOOY."  HOWARD STERN'S PEANUTS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS. THAT'S A CODE FOR A VERY FAMOUS  RADIO PERSONALITY. SO CNN, WAS THERE ALSO ANY  PERHAPS MORE CREDIBLE SOURCE  WITH WHAT THEY CALL FACTUAL  INFORMATION.
THIS FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  SOURCE HAS JUST COMMUNICATED  WITH A SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE BUT NO ARREST. ANYONE WHO SAYS AN ARREST IS  AHEAD OF THEMSELVES.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: I THINK THEY'RE TALKING  ABOUT YOU. WHEN YOU WROTE IT, DID YOU GO [BLEEP]. IN THE SPACE OF, I DON'T KNOW,  AN AFTERNOON, THIS SUSPECT WENT  FROM DEFINITELY CAUGHT AND HEADED TO FEDERAL COURT TO  (BREATHING HEAVILY) NEVER  EXISTED. IT'S LIKE A NEWS STORY AS  IMAGINED BY M. NIGHT SHAMALAYAN. HERE'S THE BEST PART. HERE'S THE BEST PART ABOUT THE  WHOLE THING. JOHN KING EXCLUSIVELY REPORTS AN  ARREST HAS BEEN MADE AND THEN  CAPS IT AN HOUR LATER WITH THE NEWS THAT THE F.B.I. WOULD  PREFER HIM TO ENJOY A HOT CUP OF  SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP. AND CNN FILLS THE ENTIRE  AFTERNOON IN BETWEEN THOSE  BOOKENDS WITH THIS.
THERE'S CLEARLY SOMETHING  AFOOT TODAY. NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT  THERE PULLING BACK SOME.
WE'RE GETTING CONFLICTING  REPORTS ABOUT AN ARREST.
THERE HAS BEEN A  MISUNDERSTANDING.
AT THIS POINT IT APPEARS THE  PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RELIABLE  SOURCES TO US THE PAST 48 HOURS EITHER WERE GIVING US INACCURATE  INFORMATION OR GOT OUT AHEAD ON  THEMSELVES.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF  CONFUSION.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT OR  NOT RIGHT. AS ANDERSON SAID YOU DON'T WANT  TO GO DOWN THE ROAD OF  SPECULATION WRONGFULLY
Jon: THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE  DOING. YOU SPENT AN HOUR DEBATING THE  MERITS OF YOUR OWN FICTION. SEE, WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO 24 NEWS  NETWORKS THRIVING ON CONFLICTS. GENERALLY THAT CONFLICT IS  BETWEEN TWO OUTSIDE PARTIES. CNN'S REPORTERS HAVE DISCOVERED  THAT THEY CAN REMOVE THE  MIDDLEMAN. AND SPEND HOURS OF PROGRAMMING  FIGHTING AMONGST THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO [BLEEP] IN THEIR OWN MOUTH. CNN HAS BECOME THE HUMAN SENT  PEED OF NEWS. FOR MORE ON TODAY'S DIZZYING  EVENTS WE GO OUT TO JOHN OLIVER  IN BOSTON. QUITE A DAY, JOHN.
HI, JOHN. YES, INDEED. LOOK A REAL BLACK MARK TO BE  HONEST ON ALL OF US IN THE  NEWS-GATHERING BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH -- I TOTALLY SHOULDN'T  BE SAYING THIS RIGHT NOW. THEY DO HAVE JUST MINUTES AGO A  SUSPECT IN CUSTODY WHICH I  OBVIOUSLY CAN'T CONFIRM BUT WILL  SAY.
Jon: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? YES, JON, YES. I'M NOT POSITIVE BUT I CAN SAY  THAT IT IS A DARK-SKINNED MALE,  POSSIBLY WHITE, OR MAYBE A  WOMAN. IT COULD BE, JON, IT COULD BE A  MANNISH WOMAN OR AN EFFIMINATE  MAN. I DON'T WANT TO APPEAR RUDE AT  THIS POINT BY ASKING THE  SUSPECT. YOU KNOW HOW SENSITIVE THESE  INSTINCTS CAN GET. RIGHT NOW ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M  HEARING IS THAT THE POLICE ARE  JUST WAITING AROUND TO SEE  WHICH...
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I'M SORRY.
WHAT'S UP? Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS, YOU'VE  ALSO BEEN REPORTING ON THE  SCENE. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING?
JON, JON, JON, I'M SORRY. I'M JUST GETTING WORD THAT ROAD  TESTS HAS BEEN LAID.
NO ARREST HAS BEEN MADE. I'M JUST GETTING THAT IN FROM A  SOURCE. I CANNOT CONFIRM THE SOURCE. I WILL SAY THAT SHE IS DARK  SKINNED, POSSIBLY TALL WITH A  CAST ON HER RIGHT WRIST.
Jon: JESSICA, DO YOU HAVE ANY  NEWS? HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING.
JON, I HEARD IF YOU HAVE SEX  IN THE BLOOD IT DOESN'T COUNT. JON, SOMEBODY JUST TOLD ME THAT.
Jon: I DIDN'T MEAN NEWS ON... ON THIS WAS FROM A CREDIBLE  SOURCE. THE GUY IS A GYM TEACHER. WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN HIM.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON  THE SUSPECT?
NO. I'M HEARING A LOT OF [BLEEP],  JON. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE  IRRESPONSIBLE. AND JUST BLURT IT OUT. HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE  JUST MORE JUDICIOUS TO WAIT THE  FIVE MINUTES IT MIGHT TAKE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION VERIFIED.
JON, CAN YOU JUMP IN HERE? IT WAS A FAT HISPANIC LADY, JON. OR WHAT I'M HEARING A DOG ON HIS  HIND LEGS WEARING GLASSES AND A  HAT. I CANNOT CONFIRM ANY MORE THAN  THAT AT THIS POINT. I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE  SAYING THIS BUT LET ME JUST  REITERATE A DOG DRESSED LIKE A DETECTIVE WALKING LIKE A MAN.
REALLY? THAT IS THE BOMBER. YOU'RE GOING TO BLAME THIS ON  McGRUFF
Jon: THAT IS RIGHT. JESSICA BRINGS UP A POINT. THAT SOUNDS LIKE McGRUFF WHO  IS A CRIME-FIGHTING DOG.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS YOU HEARD IT HERE  EXCLUSIVELY AND FIRST
Jon: GREAT WORK AGAIN, GUYS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
