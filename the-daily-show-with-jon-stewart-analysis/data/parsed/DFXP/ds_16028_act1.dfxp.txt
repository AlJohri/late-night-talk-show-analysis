FEBRUARY 24, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: VERY QUICKLY, BEFORE WE GET STARTED, JUST... WE ALSO  DIDN'T TALK ABOUT TUNA SALADS AND EGG SALADS. NOW THAT'S SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT YOU TRADITIONLY ASSOCIATE WITH A NEW YORK DELI, BUT IS  YOUR FATHER A RUG LA MAN? IS HE A RUG LA MAN? DOES HE LIKE A NICE JEWISH PASTRY OR A BOBKA? A CHOCOLATE BOBKA? THIS IS A BOBKA THAT YOU WOULD NO SOONER EAT THAN (BEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THIS IS THE BEST. YOU WILL... FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW, HER FATHER WANTED A SANDWICH FROM THE DELI. (LAUGHTER) I HAD MARRIED ONE OF THEIR CORN BEEF SANDWICHES BACK IN 1988  BEFORE ANYBODY... ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY. LITERALLY MY FAVORITE TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY GUEST TONIGHT, CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL FOR ECONOMIC ADVISORS, US A STAN GOOLSBEE. HE'LL BE HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, I'M BACK FROM THE BIRD FLU BONN. I'M TALKING DELI TALK. THE TURMOIL IN NORTH AFTERNOON A OR WHAT WE PERSIST IN CALLING  MESS O'THE WHOLE POTAMIA REGION. THE REVOLUTION WAVE THAT BEGAN IN TUNISIA AND SPREAD TO EGYPT MAY WELL SURPRISE EVEN  EXPERIENCED OBSERVERS OF THIS REGION. BUT A PEOPLE'S REVOLT IN LIBYA, A COUNTRY POSSESSING A RARE COMBINATION OF MASSIVE OIL RESERVES, WIDESPREAD POVERTY AND  A BAT (BEEP) LEADER WHO ON A GOOD DAY RESEMBLES A WAX FIGURE OF DAN ANY TREJO THAT'S BEEN  LEFT OUT IN THE SUN... (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THE UPRISING'S TARGET, PRESIDENT FOR WHAT LITTLE REMAINS OF HIS  LIFE, MOAMMAR QADDAFI... (LAUGHTER) ... HAS ALWAYS DEFIED DESCRIPTION. ALTHOUGH I PERSONALLY FAVOR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF JIM HENSON HAD MADE A MUPPET VERSION OF PRINCE. (LAUGHTER)
YOUNG REVOLUTIONARY, 1970s HIPSTER, PROUD BEDOUIN AND AS THE LONDON PRESS DESCRIBED HIM, A CROSS BETWEEN MICHAEL JACKSON AND FILL SPECTER. HATES ELEVATORS, LOVES FLAMENCO.
Jon: THAT'S FROM HIS E-HARMONY PROFILE. (LAUGHTER) BUT, BY THE WAY, LOVE FLAS MENTION CO-, HATESS ELEVATORS, EXPLAINS WHY QADDAFI INVENTED THE FLA-MESCALATOR. THAT INVENTION PLUS OIL RESERVES MADE HIM A WEALTHY MAN. NOW, QADDAFI, WHO UNNAMED SOURCES HAVE SAID RESEMBLES A 1991 LIE FELL RICHIE AFTER HE'D  TAKEN A QUICK PEEK INSIDE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT... (LAUGHTER) WE HAVE LIKE A HUNDRED OF THESE AND I HAVE TO GET THEM OUT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS GUY IS GOING TO LAST AND THESE DESCRIPTIONS ARE... (LAUGHTER) QADDAFI'S ALREADY LOST CONTROL OF LIBYA'S EASTERN HALF, INCLUDING THE CITY OF BENGHAZI WHERE WEDNESDAY CROWDS TOOK TO THE STREETS TO CELEBRATE THEIR  FREEDOM AND VENT DECADES OF SUPPRESSED RAGE AT LARRY FROM THE THREE STOOGES. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE KICKING THAT GUY. SINCE THE UNREST BEGAN, QADDAFI HAS TAKEN A VARIETY OF TACKS TO CONNECT WITH THOSE IN THE  COUNTRY STILL LOYAL TO HIM. SUCH AS REMINDING THEM HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE TO HIM.
( translated ): WITH THE SWORD... OH, IT'S RAINING, I WAS  GOING TO TALK TO THE YOUTH IN GREEN SQUARE AND SPEND THE NIGHT WITH THEM TONIGHT BUT IT IS RAINING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES, I TRULY DID WANT TO RAISE MY CITIZEN'S SOLIDARITY  WITH THOSE WHO WILL SOON BE BATTLING THE DETERMINED OPPOSITION IN WHICH WHAT WILL BE  A FIGHT TO THE DEATH, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE HUMIDITY... (LAUGHTER) MY THEIR THE RAIN, I GET LIKE A CRAZY JEW-FRO. SOON THEREAFTER QADDAFI REALIZED HE WOULD HAVE TO LOSE THE UMBRELLA, TAKE THINGS UP A NOTCH  PERHAPS DITCHING THE CHRISTOPHER WALKEN TRANSLATOR WOULDN'T HURT EITHER.
( translated ): THOSE WHO CHALLENGE ANGER, I GREET YOU. WE DEFIED AMERICA FROM HERE, AMERICA WITH ITS POWER. WE DEFIED THE ATOMIC... THE WORLD ATOMIC POWER. A SMALL GROUP OF YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN HALLUCINATION PILLS ARE RAISING RAZING THE POLICE  STATIONS HERE AND THERE LIKE RATS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: A LITTLE CHRISTOPHER WALKEN WITH A LITTLE BORAT IN THERE AS WELL. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU'RE BLAMING AMERICA AND THE WORLD'S ATOMIC POWERS AND  WHATEVER THE HELL HALLUCINATION PILLS ARE. CLASSIC STUFF. I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO DO THE TRICK THIS TIME, QADDAFI. WITH ALL THE CONSTANT CHANGES AND NUTTY TALK, IT MAKES YOU WONDER HOW A GUY LIKE THIS HELD  POWER FOR 42 YEARS. HE HAS TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE CONVINCING UP HIS SLEEVE, A SLEEVE HE APPEARS TO HAVE  BORROWED FROM BROADWAY LEGEND TINE DALEY. WE REALLY COULD DUES THIS ALL NIGHT. WHAT'S HIS ACE IN THE HOLE?
THE LEADER CALLED ON HIS SUPPORTERS TO ATTACK AND KILL DEMONSTRATORS, HUNTING THEM DOWN  HOUSE TO HOUSE.
A CATASTROPHE FUELED NOT JUST BY THE LIBYAN MILITARY BUT REPORTEDLY BY PAID MERCENARIES  FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. HIRED GUNS OF CHAD, NIGER AND ZIMBABWE.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT HE'S A (BEEP), I FORGOT. HIRING OUTSOURCED AFRICAN MERCENARYS TO KILL HIS OWN PEOPLE. WHERE DO YOU EVEN FIND PEOPLE WHO WILL L DO THAT JOB? Actualmonster.com? (LAUGHTER) BUT WITH HIS GRIP ON POWER GROWING MORE TENUOUS BY THE HOUR  AND OLD STANDBYS LIKE AMERICA HATRED AND BLOODY REPRESSION NOT WORKING, IT WAS TIME FOR QADDAFI  TO THROW A HAIL MARY, OR WHATEVER ITS APPROPRIATE REGIONAL AND RELIGIOUS EQUIVALENT.
( translated ): ONCE THEY DRINK THESE PILLS, THEY LET THEM GO OUT ON THE STREETS AND START  COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTS. THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE UNDER BIN LADEN'S INFLUENCE AND AUTHORITY.
Jon: WHOA! (LAUGHTER) WAIT A SECOND. FOR 42 YEARS YOU FED AMERICA A TON OF (BEEP), COMMITTED DROOISS AGAINST US, FINALLY AN UPRISEING  IS GOING TO KICK YOU DOWN AND WE HAVE TO SHARE CREDIT WITH THIS GUY? (LAUGHTER) WAIT A SECOND, MAYBE IT'S TRUE. WHICH WOULD MEAN RIGHT NOW LIBYA IS A FIGHT BETWEEN AFRICAN MERCENARIES WHO ARE RUTHLESS AND  AL QAEDA. THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES TO SLOWLY BACK OUT OF THE ROOM. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THAT IS SOME ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR [NO AUDIO]. (LAUGHTER) AND WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD REFRAINED FROM PUBLIC STATEMENTS  ON THE LIBYAN CRISIS UNTIL YESTERDAY, CAREFULLY CAB BRETING HIS MESSAGE AS TO NOT FURTHER  UNTETHER A MAN WHO EASE CONFUSED WITH THE BALL FROM CASTWAYWAY, WILSON, IF WILSON DRESSED LIKE A JEDI NIGHT... OKAY, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF STEAM WITH HIM, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU. OTHER WORLD LEADERS WERE LESS CIRCUMSTANCE SPECT.
( translated ): IT IS UNIMAGINABLE THAT THERE IS SOMEONE WHO THE ABLE TO KILL AND  BOMBARD HIS OWN PEOPLE. HOW CAN A RULER BOMBARD HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THEN SAY "I WILL KILL ANYONE WHO OPPOSES ME"? THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. I THINK THE WHOLE WORLD WAS APPALLED AT WHAT HAPPENED IN LIBYA. IT WAS VERY BAD BEHAVIOR AND I HOPE THEY WILL MAKE UP FOR THAT  AND MEET THEIR PEOPLE'S DEMANDS.
Jon: WHAT THE WHAT? (LAUGHTER) MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD IS DISAPPOINTED THAT QADDAFI WOULD FIRE ON HIS OWN PROTESTING PEOPLE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MAY BE THE SCARIEST THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION, I THINK IRAN HAS  FINALLY MASTERED THE TECHNOLOGY TO WEAPONIZE IRONY. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
