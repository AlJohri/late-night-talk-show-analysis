Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD   NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE  GUEST. FROM THE GREAT GATSBY ACTRESS  CAREC MULLIGAN IS JOINING US. I HEARD THE MOVIE IS GREAT, SO  GREAT THAT THEY'RE THINKING OF  MAKING THE MOVIE INTO A BOOK. LET'S GET TO THE TOP STORY  TONIGHT. TESTAMENT FROM GOVERNMENT  WHISTLE BLOWERS ON THE  DEVASTATING AND TRAGIC ATTACK  THAT CAUSED FOUR AMERICAN LIVES IN BENGHAZI LIBYA, TESTIMONY  THAT WILL BLOW THE LID OFF THE  GIANT COVER-UP PROPAGATED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION.
BRACE YOURSELF. IT'S HAPPENING IN JUST  NINE-AND-A-HALF HOURS FORMER  C.I.A. DIRECTOR DAVID PETRAEUS WILL TAKE THE OATH AND TESTIFY  ABOUT BENGHAZI.
Jon: I'M SORRY. THAT WAS A SNAFU. THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE WARNING TO  BRACE YOURSELF FOR NOVEMBER'S  BENGHAZI TESTIMONY BY DAVID  PETRAEUS. THAT WAS GOING TO BLOW THE LID  OFF THE GIANT COVER-UP  PROPAGATED BY THIS  ADMINISTRATION. MY MISTAKE. ALL RIGHT. TODAY'S HEARING WAS THE HEARING  MOMENT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN  WAITING FOR.
WE BEGIN WITH THE MOMENT THAT  EVERYBODY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY  CLINTON'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED  TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN  BENGHAZI.
Jon: I APOLOGIZE ONCE MORE. THAT WAS FROM THE JANUARY  BENGHAZI HEARINGS. THAT ALSO FAILED TO BLOW THE LID  OFF THE GIANT COVER-UP  PROPAGATED BY THIS  ADMINISTRATION. TODAY, WEDNESDAY.
COME WEDNESDAY YOU'RE GOING  TO START HEARING THE TRUTH ABOUT  BENGHAZI. IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU MAD. IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU UPSET.
Jon: AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE'VE  HAVE ANOTHER ONE UNTIL IT DOES. YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY FOR  BENGHAZI CONGRESS HAS HELD NINE  FULL HEARINGS. INCLUDING ONE CLOSED HEARING. WHY AMBASSADOR PICKERRING AND  ADMIRAL MULLENNISH EYED A FULL  ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CHASTISING THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR  SYSTEMIC FAILURES AND WHY  BENGHAZI IS GENERALLY EMERGED AS A RALLYING CRY FOR THE  PRESIDENT'S OPPONENTS. WHEN DURING THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION, THERE WERE 54  ATTACKS ON DIPLOMATIC TARGETS THAT KILLED 13 AMERICANS YET  GARNERED ONLY THREE HEARINGS ON  EMBASSY SECURITY TOTAL AND ZERO OUTRAGE FROM FOX. WHY IS THIS ATTACK SO DIFFERENT  FOR REPUBLICANS?
THIS MAKES WATERGATE LOOK  LIKE CHILD'S PLAY, MEGAN.
Jon: OH! WELL, THAT IS SERIOUS. THAT IS SERIOUS AND IT'S NOT A  TERM PEOPLE THROW AROUND  LIGHTLY. I'M SORRY. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SLIND RA. I'M SORRY. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SLIND RA. ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT BENGHAZI.
THIS IS FAR WORSE THAN  WATERGATE.
Jon: FAR WORSE THAN  WATERGATE. THERE YOU HAVE IT. BENGHAZI IS... SORRY ABOUT THAT. HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE  FAST-AND-FURIOUS. THE MOVIES BECAUSE I DIDN'T CARE  FOR TOKYO DRIFT BUT I DON'T  THINK IT... ALL RIGHT. THE THING WITH THE GUNS AND THE  TRACING OF THEM. IF FAST-AND-FURIOUS WAS WORSE  THAN WATERGATE WHAT'S BENGHAZI.
IF YOU HAD WATERGATE AND  IRAN-CONTRA TOGETHER AND  MULTIPLY IT BY TEN OR SO YOU'LL GET IN THE ZONE OF WHAT BENGHAZI  IS.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]. WATERGATE PLUS IRAN-CONTRA TIMES   TIMES... YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE  INCIDENT WHEREBY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  PEOPLE BROKE INTO THE DEMOCRATIC  HEADQUARTERS TO BUG IT TO GAIN STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IN A  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEN  COVERED THAT UP BY TRYING TO USE THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO  SQUASH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  AND THEN ADDED THAT TO THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S SECRET  DEAL TO ILLEGALLY SELL ARMS TO  IRAN IN EXCHANGE FOR HOSTAGES AND MONEY THAT COULD THEN BE  FUNNELED TO CENTRAL AMERICAN  RIGHT WING DEATH SQUADS, END PARENTHESES, TIMES TEN? I'M IN. I'M IN. HOW COULD IT NOT BE? I'M IN. WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT DO?
WHEN IT ALL WENT DOWN IN  BENGHAZI, THE ADMINISTRATION  FACING THE ELECTION WENT INTO PANIC MODE, WANTED TO CONTAIN  IT, DON'T SEND IN THE MILITARY. DON'T BLOW THIS INTO A BIGGER  THING THAN IT'S GOING TO BE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S  CASE WAS COWARDLY, DUPLICITOUS  AND THEY SACRIFICED AMERICAN LIVES FOR POLITICS.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY  OUTRAGE JUSTIFIED. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES TO CONSCIOUSLY ALLOW  AMERICANS TO DIE TO PROTECT HIS OWN POLITICAL CHANCES IS DAMNING   DAMNING. YOUR LEVEL OF ANGER IS IN FACT  JUSTIFIED. AS IS THE QUESTION YOU'VE BEEN  ASKING NOW FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
WHERE IS THE MEDIA OUTRAGE ON  LIBYA AND BENGHAZI?
WHY IS THIS STORY NOT GETTING  MORE COVERAGE IN THE MAINSTREAM  MEDIA.
WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE. Jon: YES! THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE? OVER OBAMA'S COVER-UP. WHICH WE KNOW IS INDEED THE  CASE.
THAT INDEED WAS THE CASE. Jon: THAT INDEED WAS THE  CASE. WAIT A MINUTE. IF THAT INDEED IS THE CASE, SEE,  I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON  HERE. THIS DEFINITELY HAPPENED, NOT IF  THAT INDEED WAS THE CASE. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? THAT'S WHY PEOPLE MAY NOT BE  OUTRAGED BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE  SAYING YOU'RE NOT SURE YET.
WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT LIED  ABOUT BENGHAZI AND WHAT IF, IN  FACT, HE KNEW ABOUT THIS MUCH  EARLIER?
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT  THEIR LIVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN  SAVED?
WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT  BENGHAZI WAS A DEATH TRAP.
IF THERE HAS INDEED BEEN A  COVER UP.
IF HE DID NOTHING. HE LIED ABOUT IT. IF HE LIED ABOUT IT. THAT'S THE CASE, JON,  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
THAT IS THE SHAME OF AMERICA. E CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE  WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT INCLUDING  POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT IF HE LIED.
Jon: YES. IF. AND IF DINGLE BERRIES WERE  DIAMONDS I COULD OPEN A JAY  JEWELERS IN MY PANTS. IF. IF. I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM HERE. YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY  EVERYONE ELSE ISN'T AS OUTRAGED  AS YOU WHEN IT'S BECAUSE THE REST OF US AREN'T SURE IF WHAT  YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE. AND TO BE QUITE FRANK, YOU DO  HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A HISTORY OF... NOT THAT YOU NECESSARILY BLOWN  THINGS OUT OF PROPORTION WITH  THIS PRESIDENT OR CREATED HIGHLY EMOTIONAL NARRATIVES CONCERNING  THIS PRESIDENT. I DO REMEMBER THIS SALUTE  HAIRING ON HANNITY JUST 100 DAYS  INTO HIS PRESIDENCY.
SO HELP YOU GOD. ME GOD. CONGRATULATIONS,  MR. PRESIDENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK A STIMULUS  IS?
I WANT HIM TO FAIL. EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA ADMITS  AMERICA'S ARROGANCE.
THIS PRESIDENT VOW BOWED  BEFORE THE SAUDI KING.
GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.
Jon: THREE MONTHS IN, YOU HAD  HIM AS DAMIAN IN THE OMEN. YOU MAY BE RIGHT. BUT WOLF HAS BEEN CRIED BEFORE. AFTER EIGHT MONTHS OF INTENSIVE  INVESTIGATION YOU SHOULD BE ABLE  TO BETTER STATE YOUR CASE THAN THIS FROM YESTERDAY.
IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'VE  DESCRIBED, IT SOUNDS LIKE  THERE'S BEEN A COVER-UP BUT WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO COVER UP?
WELL, AGAIN, THIS IS WHY  WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE TRUTH.
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE COME  OUT IF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE,  IF DARRELL ISSA IF OUR COMMITTEE DIDN'T CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS.
Jon: YOU HAVE NO [BLEEP] IDEA. IF WHAT HE'S SAYING IS TRUE... AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION,  IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE,  IF THE PRESIDENT LET AMERICANS DIE FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEN  BY GOD, BRING US THE EVIDENCE  AND WE WILL GRAB THE PITCH FORKS AND TORCHES ALONG WITH YOU. BUT REMEMBER THAT GAME GOES BOTH  WAYS. LET ME TRY. IN 2011 THE STATE DEPARTMENT  REQUESTED FUNDING FOR WORLDWIDE  SECURITY PROTECTION AND UPGRADES MONEY THAT COULD PERHAPS HAVE  GONE TO PROTECT BENGHAZI. THE REPUBLICANS LIKE DARRELL  ISSA WHO IS HEADING UP THIS  COMMITTEE VOTED TO CUT THAT  FUNDING. MAYBE BECAUSE OF POLITICAL  REASONS IN AN ELECTION YEAR TO  MAKE THE PRESIDENT LOOK WEAK. THUS SACRIFICING AMERICANS FOR  POLITICAL GAIN. DID THAT HAPPEN?
IF THAT'S THE CASE, JOHN,  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
