FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT FRESH OFF --  FRESH OFF GOLDEN GLOBE WIN FOR  ACTING, PRODUCING, CHOREOGRAPHY, LENA DUNHAM IS ON THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY THE BIG NEWS PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S HOTLY ANTICIPATED  ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS NEW STEPS TO TRY TO CURB GUN VIOLENCE. AH, I DIDN'T SEE IT. I DON'T -- [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT -- I DON'T WANT TO  BRING THE ROOM DOWN. MY MIND HAS BEEN ELSEWHERE. MY GIRLFRIEND, WHO TOTALLY  EXISTS -- [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S HER. YOU DON'T KNOW HER. [ LAUGHTER ] IS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH TIME. SHE DIED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN, AH, AND THEN, AH, ALSO  FELL OFF A CLIFF OF LEUKEMIA. [ LAUGHTER ] SO IT'S A TOUGH DAY TO BE HERE  FOR ME. BUT I'M GOING TO DO IT. HER LAST TWEET TO ME WAS, "THIS  SHOW MUST GO OOOOOOON. -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- WAIT, WAIT, #THUMP. ALL RIGHT. SO I MISSED THE WHOLE PRESS  CONFERENCE. WHAT HAPPENED?
LOCK AND LOAD.
OBAMA LAYS OUT HIS AGAIN  CONTROL PLAN.
THE UNPRECEDENTED ASSAULT ON  YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS MEANT AS  A FINAL FIREWALL AGAINST  TYRANNY.
HE IS NOT A KING OR A CZAR.
GOING AFTER OUR GUNS.
CHIPPING AWAY AT OUR FREEDOM.
BARACK OBAMA CAME IN PEACE TO  RIP OUR CONSTITUTION TO PIECES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: (bleep) WHAT DID HE  DO? LET'S LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT'S  OPENING STATEMENT.
KNEEL BEFORE ZOD.
Jon: OH, THAT IS BAD. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS BAD. WHAT DICTATES DID KING BAMA  DECREE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED  CONGRESS YESTERDAY TO PASS NEW  LAWS INS -- INSTITUTING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND  BANS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS AND HIGH  CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
Jon: TWO THINGS, ONE, THOSE  MEASURES ENJOY, I BELIEVE,  MAJORITY SUPPORT IN THE LATEST  POLL. AND TWO, WHEN TYRANTS WANT  SOMETHING THEY THEY GENERALLY  DON'T ASK THEIR LEGISLATIVE BODIES IF THAT WOULD BE OKAY. THEY TEND TO PROCEED WHAT IS THE  WORD I'M LOOKING FOR TIE  RANNICLY? WHAT AM I MISSING?
A TOTAL OF 23 EXECUTIVE SIGNS  SIGNED DIRECTLY IMPACTING YOUR  RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IN  THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT ARE  UNAMERICAN AND FASCIST.
DOES HE NOT BELIEVE IN  COEQUAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
Jon: THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS  THAT IS WHAT MAKES HIM A TYRANT. LET'S SEE WHAT KING OBAMA IS  BYPASSING CONGRESS TO DO. EXECUTIVE ORDERED A LAUNCH OF A  NATIONAL AND SAFE RESPONSIBLE  GUN OWNERSHIP CAMPAIGN. ORDERED NOMINATION OF AN ATF  DIRECTOR, A LAUNCH ON A DIALOG  ON MENTAL HEALTH AND ALLUG THE CENTERS OF DISEASE CONTROL TO  CONDUCT RESEARCH IN THE CAUSE OF  GUN VIOLENCE AND THE WAYS TO PREVENT IT? REALLY? TYRANNY? BECAUSE WHEN I LISTEN TO THAT  THAT AIN'T (bleep) HITLER. I GUESS HANNITY WANTS TO PROTECT  AMERICAN LIBERTIES AND WOULD  STAND UP TO ANY PRESIDENTIAL OVERREACH EVEN IF IT WAS DONE IN  SAVING LIVES. IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO  LISTEN TO YOUR PRIVATE  CONVERSATION WITHOUT A WARRANT. I CAN'T IMAGINE HANNITY TALKING  ABOUT THAT IN 2006.
THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO THE  CONSTITUTION IN COMMANDER IN  CHIEF HE HAS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, DOESN'T HE,  ESPECIALLY DURING WAR.
Jon: LIKES LIKE A TYRANT IS  ANYONE SWORN TO PROTECT THE  CONSTITUTION YOU DIDN'T VOTE  FOR. FORMER PRESS SECRETARY DANA  PERINO THOUGHT IT WAS AN  UNTASTY --
EVEN IF THAT MEANS SURCOUPLE  VENTING CONGRESS. SIGNING THESE 23 EXECUTIVE  ORDERS IS WEAK TEA.
Jon: HERE TESS IN HER  PREVIOUS JOB.
THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN AN  EXECUTIVE ORDER PRESERVING TWO  RECREATIONAL FISH, THE STRIPED BASS AND RED DRUM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NO, NO, THERE'S A  DISTINCTION HERE. THERE'S A STRONG DISTINCTION  HERE. IT'S OKAY TO USE EXECUTIVE  ORDERS BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE  PROTECTING THESE SCHOOLS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT ONLY WAS OBAMA GUILTY OF  EXECUTIVE OVERREACH, YESTERDAY  OHM BALM YAFS GUILTY OF EXECUTIVE OVER DRA TIESATION.
USING CHILDREN RAISING THE  EMOTIONAL HACKELS.
I FIND IT DESPICABLE. LET'S SEE FIT MERITS IT OUT.
Jon: YES THAT WAS  MANIPULATE ACTIVE (bleep). THAT WAS STAGECRAFT NO QUESTION. WHICH I THINK YOU CAN ARGUE  ABOUT AND THE RIGHT HAS BEEN  TRYING  TRYING TO HARD TO MAINTAIN A RATIONAL DIALOG ABOUT GUN FNCHES  HE DOES EXECUTIVE ORDERS HE IS  BECOME LIKE CHAVEZ.
LIKE HITLER, LIKE MAO.
IT HAPPENED IN ITALY, SPAIN,  IEW AND GOOD YANCH EVEN USING  CHILDREN.
REMINDS ME OF SADDAM HUSSEIN  WHEN HE USED KIDS.
Jon: WOW! IT'S LIKE A GAME OF $25,000  PYRAMID WHERE THE CATEGORIES ARE  DICTATORS OR UNFLATTERING  MUSTACHES. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE WE'RE NOT READY TO HAVE A  SPECIFIC CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT  GOVERNMENT CAN DO ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE UNTIL WE HAVE A CLEAR  UNDERSTANDING ON HOW WE RECORD  OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE  GOVERNMENT. IF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO  BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS THE  GOVERNMENT SHOULD GO FIRST. AND TURN IN THEIR ASSAULT  WEAPONS THAT THEY ENGAGE --
Jon: SIT. [ LAUGHTER ] SEE NOW WE'RE HAVING A RATIONALE  LOGICAL CONVERSATION. SO IN YOUR MIND, YOU BELIEVE GUN  CONTROL IS AN ARMS TREATY  TBHOATION OUR U.S. MILITARY AS THE FOUNDERS INTENDED. HERE IS WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT  THIS:  THE WHIFF OF SELF  FULFILLING PROPHECY. IF YOU ARE GIRDING YOURSELF WITH  A MASSIVE BATTLE WITH A  UBER-GOVERNMENT STOCKING UP ON CANS OF MUSHROOM SOUP FIT  DOESN'T HAPPEN YOU LIKE LIKE AN  (bleep) WITH A SOUP FETISH. BUT NO ONE IS GOING TOLL TELL  YOU THAT -- GOING TO TELL YOU  THAT TO YOUR FACE. BUT THE ONLY WAY YOUR LIFE WOULD  BE MEANINGFUL WOULD BE IN THE  TYRANNY COMES TRUE WHICH PUTS YOU IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION OF  HAVING TO ARGUE TYRANNY  HYPOTHETICALS.
I AM JEWISH. I THINK WHAT WOULD THE GERMAN  JEWS HAVE DONE WITH A STOCKPILE  OF WEAPONS? THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN  MURDERED.
Jon: I WISH -- YOU CAN'T  EVER KNOW HOW HISTORY WOULD HAVE  BEEN DIFFERENT UNLESS YOU HAVE A DEDLRKS LOREAN. I WISH THAT ARMED JEWS IN THE  GHETTO COULD HAVE STOPPED THEM  BUT FRANCE COULDN'T AND I'M PRETTY SURE THEY HAD GUNS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RUSSIA, RUSSIA HAD KIND OF A LOT  OF GUNS AND THEY COULDN'T STOP  HITLER UNTIL YOU FACTORED IN THE  WINDCHILL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S AN ALL OF LOT TO PUT ON AN  OPPRESSED MINORITY WHEN IT TOOK  THE FREE WORLD 5-6 OF ALL ALL TOTAL WORE -- WAR TO STOP THAT  (bleep). LET'S STOP ARGUING WHAT IF.
I THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING  WOULD AGREE WITH ME IF HE WERE  ALIVE TODAY.
Jon: YEAH, HOW DID HE DIE  AGAIN? BUT GO ON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GO ON. NO, IT'S GOOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND REMEMBER MONDAY IS HIS  BIRTHDAY. GO AHEAD.
THAT IF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAD  BEEN GIVEN THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND  BEAR ARMS FROM DAY ONE OF COUNTRY'S FOUNDING PERHAPS  SLAVERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A  CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY.
Jon: THEY SAY IT'S YOUR  BIRTHDAY. ♪ ♪  YES, IF ONLY THE AFRICANS  BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY IN  CHAINS HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE GUNS, AH -- ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY  GIVEN THE CLIMATE OF THE COUNTRY  AT THAT TIME WOULD THEY HAVE GOTTEN WHOLE GUNS OR  THREE-FIFTHS OF A GUN? WE WILL NEVER KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU ARE NOT  GOING TO GET ANY PUSH BACK IN  THIS COUNTRY ON YOUR POINT ABOUT NOT WANTING OR LIKING TYRANNY. THE QUESTION IS A DISAGREEMENT  IN JUST HOW CLOSE WE ARE  TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF IT AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE CONFUSING  TYRANNY WITH THE UNPLEASANT  SENSATION OF LOSING ELECTIONS WHICH WE JUST HAD. IF OBAMA WERE A TYRANT ARE THESE  THE NUMBERS HE WOULD PUT UP? TYRANTS DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT THAT  (bleep) HARD FOR OHIO. AND GENERALLY -- GENERALLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ING FOR ABOUT UTTERLY TANKING  YOUR FIRST DEBATE, TYRANTS DON'T  SHOW UP FOR THOSE. THE REAL DEBATE FOR TYRANTS IS  HOW BIG YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE  SUNGLASSES? I GUESS IT'S SUMMED BY THE OLD  HOMILY FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE  GUNS AND I SAID NOTHING BECAUSE THEY
