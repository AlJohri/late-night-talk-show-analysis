Jon: NO. YOU GOT TO GO THATS THE END OF IT TRIUMPH. TRUMPH! THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. ALL RIGHT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS: SO SIMON AND GARFUNKEL COULDN'T HOLD TWO GUYS TOGETHER. HOW DID NINE- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? HOW DO WE COME BACK 20 YEARS LATER AND GET EVERYBODY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?
WELL, I THINK WE ARE ALL STRIVING FOR A BETTER TOMORROW. WU-TANG, WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER, A BROTHERHOOD, A RESPECT, AND WHEN WE SAY "A BETTER TOMORROW," WE'RE STRIVING TO MAKE A BETTER TOMORROW FOR OURSELVES, BUT ALSO TO INSPIRE A BETTER TOMORROW FOR THE WORLD, YO.
Jon: HOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO GATHER EVERYBODY? WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE, CREATIVE, BUSINESS OR POLITICAL? WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE? CHEF?
Jon: OR WAS CHEF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE.
I WOULD SAY IT'S ALL OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE TRAILBLAZERS IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS. WE BEEN AROUND THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING OUR JOB. I CONSIDER THIS A SPORT. SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS AN ATHLETE OF MUSIC TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GOT YOUR BUSINESS TOGETHER, MAKE SURE YOU FEEL HAPPY, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, YOU JUST GOT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU GOT YOUR I'S DOTTED, YOUR T'S CROSSED IN BUSINESS BECAUSE WE HAVE FAMILIES. WE GO OUT AND WORK FOR OUR FAMILIES.
Jon: RIGHT.
MY THING IS IF I'M NOT GOING TO SEE MY CHILDREN AND I'M OUT HERE DOING A JOB, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GO OUT THERE AND DO WHAT I SAY I'M GOING TO DO, GET BACK HOME TO THEM AND HIT UP DISNEYLAND.
Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY. BE SANTA CLAUS. NOW, GHOST, I WAS WORRIED THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE GHOST, CAME IN A LITTLE LATE. YOU'RE THE HEART. YOU'RE AN EMOTIONAL GUY. YOU BRING IT FROM THE HEART. DID YOU HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT COMING BACK AND LAYING DOWN THINGS?
I MEAN, THIS IS MY LIFE RIGHT HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO THIS IS MY BROTHER IN LAW SO WE BEEN TIGHT EVER SINCE DAY ONE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO AS SOON AS HE SAID, WE COMING BACK TO DO "A BETTER TOMORROW," I'M ALWAYS WITH IT. EVEN THOUGH SOMETIMES YOU GOT YOUR LITTLE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I'M ONE THAT LIKES FOR EVERYTHING TO BE RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, FROM THE STAGE SHOW, TO THE WARDROBES AND EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY BE ON POINT. IF ONE THING IS OFF, IT THROWS ME OFF, BUT FOR THE TEAM, I'LL TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM. AND I'LL CONTINUE. I DON'T GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIVES INDIVIDUALLY, BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL SUCCESSFUL ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WHICH I DON'T THINK HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE WHERE YOU GET A GROUP LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE ALL THESE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, THEN AS A GROUP YOU HAVE THAT SUPERSTAR STATUS. IS THAT HOW YOU FEEL, METH, WHEN THEY SAY WE'RE FAMILY, WHEN THE CALL COMES IN, YOU DROP IT AND YOU COME?
ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN... FROM... I THINK WE'VE BEEN SO BLESSED TO HAVE THE SAME JOB FOR LIKE THE PAST 20, 21 YEARS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, AND NOT HURT NOBODY DOING IT. AND LIKE SOON AS WE CAME TOGETHER FOR ONE COMMON CAUSE, WE KNEW THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SOMETHING GREAT AND IT SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN THE END.
Jon: AND IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING TO SEE THE WHOLE GROUP. I KNOW DIRTY'S ALWAYS ON THE MINDS. YOU KEEP HIM IN YOUR HEARTS AS YOU GO ALONG. >>OH WE GOT DIRTY RIGHT HERE
Jon: WHAT DO WE GOT? WHAT DO WE GOT? OH, YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO SLEEP IN THIS. ALRIGHT I MAY HAVE TO PUT THIS ON NOW. WHEN WE COME BACK, HISTORIC PERFORMANCE FROM THE WU-TANG CLAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS.
