Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY  GUEST TONIGHT PLAYS  BASKETBALL WITH THE NEW YORK  KNICKER BOCKERS AND THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK SERIES FOR  CHILDREN, NUMBER ONE HOME  COURT, NUMBER TWO NEXT WEEK  DOUBLE TEAM. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE  PROGRAM AMARE STOUDEMIRE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Stephen: MUST BE NICE. (LAUGHTER)  HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >>.
FEEL GREAT.
Stephen: DO YOU FEEL IN  SHAPE, DOW FEEL READY,  YOU'RE STARTING THE SEASON  IN LIKE A WEEK.
YEAH, WE START TRAINING  CAMP SHORTLY.
Stephen: ARE YOU GOING TO  BE ABLE TO GET IN SHAPE BY  THEN, I MEAN REALLY YOU LET  YOURSELF GO IN THE OFF SEASON A LITTLE BIT I SEE. TELL ME ABOUT THIS, SU HAVE  TWO BOOKS. WHAT IS THE GIST OF THIS. HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT  THESE TWO BOOKS.
WELL, THERE IS A SHORTAGE  OF YOUNG BOYS THAT WANT TO  READ FROM THE AGES OF 8 TO  12. AND I FIGURE IF I WRITE A  BOOK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, A  FEW OF MY CHILDHOOD STORIES  WITHIN THESE BOOKS THEN THE YOUNG BOYS WILL BE INTRIGUED  FROM THE FACT I'M A  BASKETBALL PLAYERS FROM THE  KNICKS AND THEY WANT TO GOUT AND HEAR ABOUT MY STORY IF  I'M GROWN-UP. I FIGURE IF I WRITE A BOOK  THAT INTRIGUES THEM TO WANT  TO READ.
Jon: AT THE END OF THIS  BOOK DOES IT TURN INTO A  VIDEO GAME BY ANY CHANCE? WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE  LOOKING, HAVE YOU DONE A LOT  OF WORK WITH KIDS NOW? YOU HAVE USED YOUR CELEBRITY,  USED YOUR FAME TO GO OUT AND  SEEN WHAT KIDS ARE CONCERNED  ABOUT NOW. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU HAVE  NOTICED, YOU HAVE SEEN THIS  THEY'RE NOT READING, THEY'RE  TO THE DOING-- WAS'S GONG IN YOUR MIND.
ABSOLUTELY. WITH AT MARE STOUDEMIRE  FOUNDATION IS BASED UPON  CURING POVERTY THROUGH  EDUCATION. AND SO A LOT OF MY WORK GOES  BACK TO THE YOUTH TO TRY TO  FIGURE OUT AREAS WHERE WE  CAN TRY TO IMPROVE THAT EDUCATION BARRIER FOR THE  YOUTH. SO THIS IS A TOOL FOR THEM  TO USE TO TRY TO IMPROVE  THEIR EDUCATION.
Jon: NOW YOU COULD BY ALL  RIGHTS IGNORE ALL OF THIS,  LIVE A VERY GOOD LIFE, VERY  RICH LIFE. I FIND IT VERY COMMENDABLE  THAT YOU GO BACK. WHAT IS IT ABOUT, IS IT YOUR  STORY THAT YOU'RE RELATING  TO, IS IT SOMETHING IN YOUR  LIFE THAT CAUSES YOU TO NOT WANT TO FORGET, TO NOT-- TO  HELP THESE KIDS.
YEAH, BECAUSE I THINK  WITH MYSELF GROWING UP,  EDUCATION WAS NOT A MAIN  PRIORITY WHEN I WAS THAT  AGE. AND OVER TIME IT BECAME TO  BECOME A FACTOR OF YOU NOT  APPLYING YOURSELF. AND SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING  THAT'S HAPPEN NOUG WITH THE  YOUTH AS A WHOLE. SO I FIGURE WITH THE AMARE  STOUDEMIRE FOUNDATION WE CAN  FIGURE OUT WAYS TO SPARK  THAT MIND TO LET THEM KNOW THAT BEING SMART IS COOL,  BEING ABLE TO READ IS COOL. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH  THAT AT ALL TO TRY TO GET  THE YOUTH TO UPLIFT THE  SMART.
Jon: BECAUSE NOT  EVERYBODY, AND THERE IS JUST  SOMETHING I'VE READ, GETS TO  PLAY FOR THE KNICKS. BUT IT IS, BECAUSE IT SO  INTERESTING TO ME, BECAUSE  THE PEOPLE THAT ULTIMATELY  END UP LOOKING UP TO REALLY ARE DOING SOMETHING  SPECTACULAR. YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU WOULD BE  6, 11 AND HAVE I GUESS WHAT  THE KIDS WOULD HAVE UPS. AND I THINK THERE IS A  TENDENCY TO THINK OH F I  JUST PLAY SOME BALL AND WORK  HARD, I WILL BECOME A AMARE  STOUDEMIRE. BUT THAT REALLY IS RAREFIED  AIR AND THIS IS MUCH MORE OF  A TOOL THAT MORE KIDS CAN  USE.
THAT IS TOTALLY TRUE IT  THERE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF  ALL THE STUDENTS OUT THERE  IN THE WORLD THAT MAKE IT TO A PROFESSIONAL SPORT LEVEL,  EXTREMELY SMALL PERCENTAGE. AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO  BE SKUK SESFUL BESIDES BEING  A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
Jon: NAME ONE.
I MEAN DOING YOUR JOB.
Jon: NOT EVEN CLOSE, NOT  EVEN CLOSE, NOT EVEN CLOSE. ALL RIGHT. IF THEY WOULD ONLY LOWER THE  RIM I WOULD TRADE THIS IN A  SECOND. DO YOU GUYS, IT IS SO  INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE  YOU KNOW, FOR YOUNG KIDS,  AND A LOT OF TIMES COME FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS,  SPORT HAS ALWAYS BEEN  SOMETHING THAT THEY LOOK AT. OR MUSIC. BUT THEY DO THERE HASN'T  BEEN AS MUCH OF AN EMPHASIS  ON EDUCATION FOR KIDS. BUT GETTING ATHLETES TO GO  BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY,  GETTING MUSESICIANS TO GO  BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND TALK BED CASE SEEMS TO  REALLY GET THROUGH TO THEM. HAVE YOU FOUND THAT HAS BEEN  A GOOD AVENUE FOR YOU  TALKING ABOUT.
ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH  THE YOUTH FOR OVER TEN YEARS  NOW. EVER SINCE MY ROOKIE YEAR  WITH THE NBA. AND BEING ON THIS PLATFORM  THAT WE ARE ON AS  PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, WE  HAVE A WILLPOWER TO WANT TO  GIVE BACK TO THE YOUTH. AND SO THEY LOOK UP TO US TO  GIVE THEM A BLUEPRINT AND BE  THAT ROLL MODEL FOR THEM.
Jon: WE ALL LOOK UP TO  YOU, YOUR STOMACH. AND HOW IS YOUR YOM KIPPUR,  WE TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE  BIT. YOU DISCOVERIED RECENTLY YOU  HAVE HEBREW BACKGROUND.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: MUST BE OBVIOUSLY A  VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THIS?
WELL, I HAVE BEEN  STUDYING, MY MOM AND MY  FATHER I HAVE BEEN STUDYING  IT FOR 12, 13 YEARS. AND I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK TO  ISRAEL AND STUDY THE HEBREW  ROOTS. AND CAME-- .
Jon: ARE YOU ABLE TO READ  HEBREW K YOU SPEAK, DO THE  PRAYERS AND ALL THAT, AND IF  SO, CAN YOU HELP ME DO THAT, BECAUSE I-- I AM EXCITED. I'M GOING COME SEE NEW YEAR. AND I'M GOING TO BRING AN  8-YEAR-OLD WITH THE BOOKS. AND WE'RE GOING TO COME AND  YOU'LL TEACH US HOW TO DUNK  OR WHATEVER YOU WILL-- YOU  GUYS GOING TO BE GOOD THIS  YEAR.
REALLY GOOD.
Jon: BETTER THAN THE HEAT? (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  BOOK NUMBER ONE, HOME COURT,  BOOK NUMBER TWO, DOUBLE  TEAM. AMARE STOUDEMIRE.
