FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE -- HELLO. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. ZEPHYR TEACHOUT WILL BE OUR GUEST, A LAW PROFESSOR, A GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, TRULY ONE OF THE FINEST-NAMED GUESTS I BELIEVE WE'VE EVER HAD IN ON THE PROGRAM. AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. SPEAKING OF GOOD NAMES, THAT'S THE SEGUE, THAT IS THE SEGUE, AND I'M STICKING WITH IT. THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE, USED TO HAVE A GOOD NAME. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS, A LESS FORGIVING AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE LEFT BY NOW. (LAUGHTER) THE NFL, OF COURSE, CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH A BIT OF AN IMAGE PROBLEM.
THE NFL, WE CAN'T TRUST THESE INSTITUTIONS.
INSTITUTION THAT HAS GOT ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS.
THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE INSTITUTION.
YOU WILL NEVER FIND A MORE WRETCHED HIVE OF SCUM AND VILLANY.
Jon: NOT SURE THAT LAST PART WAS ABOUT THE NFL, BUT STILL! NOW WE'VE ALL SEEN THE TAPE OF RAISABLE RAVENS RUNNINGBACK RAY RICE, AND WITNESSED THE LEAGUE'S REACTION. THE LEAGUE, OF COURSE, DISHED OUT SWIFT, OLD TESTAMENT STYLE JUSTICE. IN THE FORM OF A TWO GAME BAN. WHICH DUE TO ENORMOUS OUTRAGE AND AN ANOTHER EVEN MORE EXPLICIT TAPE BECAME A LIFETIME SUSPENSION. AS WELL AS PERNICIOUS PANTHERS PRO-BALLPLAYER, ACCEPTED AND NOTED. GREG HARDY'S CONVICTION ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHARGES RESULTING IN NO SUSPENSION, AND THEN A ONE GAME BENCHING WITH AN OPTION TO WATCH, FOLLOWED BY THE PANTHERS'S ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT HE IS DONE UNTIL HE APPEALS HIS MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT'S THE KIND OF FIRM DECISION-MAKING WE'VE COME TO EXPECT FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] THEY'RE DOING. (APPLAUSE)
BUT DON'T WORRY. THE NFL HAS FINALLY FIGURED OUT A SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEMS.
THE LEAGUE APPOINTING FOUR WOMEN INCLUDING A VICE PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE ITS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EFFORTS. AND THREE SENIOR ADVISORS, ONE A FORMER HEAD OF MANHATTAN'S SEX CRIMES UNIT.
Jon: SO WE'RE DONE HERE. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW YOUR BUSINESS MODEL IS IN ROUGH SHAPE WHEN YOU NEED TO APPOINT YOUR OWN IN-HOUSE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT. (LAUGHTER) ALTHOUGH I'M SURE SEASON TWO PROMISES BIG SURPRISES. THERE YOU GO. BUT LISTEN, THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. NOW WE GOT IT ALL TAKEN CARE OF. AND WE CAN GO BACK GUILT-FREE TO SPENDING THE LORD'S DAY WATCHING FOOTBALL, THIS REALTIME EXPERIMENT IN BUMPER BRAINS.
STAR RUNNINGBACK ADRIAN PETERSON NOW APOLOGIZING AFTER HE WAS CHARGED WITH CHILD ABUSE.
Jon: [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER) NOT FORMER LEAGUE MVP ADRIAN PETERSON FOR WHOM I MAY HAVE GIVEN UP A [BLEEP] LOAD TO DRAFT IN MY FANTASY LEAGUE. (LAUGHTER) GOD! WELL, I GUESS THE NFL IS GOING TO HAVE TO FORM A PANEL OF CHILDREN NOW. I DON'T-- WHAT DO YOU DO?
A WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR PETERSON'S ARREST.
THE CHARGES STEM FROM PETERSON PHYSICALLY DISCIPLINING HIS SON WITH A TREE BRANCH.
PETERSON RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING I'M NOT A PERFECT PARENT BUT I AM WITHOUT A DOUBT NOT A CHILD ABUSER.
Jon: YOU BEAT A FOUR-YEAR-OLD WITH A TREE BRANCH. HERE'S A TIP. FOR ANY PRO FOOTBALL PLAYERS OUT THERE, CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY MAY BE CHILD ABUSERS. YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING TO A FOUR-YEAR-OLD THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO TO A 300 POUND LINEMAN IN A HELMET AND PADS. SO--  (APPLAUSE) I ASSUME THAT WOULD BE A PENALTY. NOW ONCE AGAIN THE NFL, BASTION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT IT IS, RESPONDED THE RIGHT WAY.
PETERSON WILL NOT BE PLAYING IN SUNDAY'S GAME AGAINST THE PATRIOTS.
Jon: OH. ACTUALLY, USUALLY WHEN I SAY THINGS IN THAT SORT OF ARCHED TONE, IT MEANS THAT THE OPPOSITE IS ABOUT TO--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH. OH. GOOD FOR YOU, NFL.
THE VIKINGS HAVE REINSTATED PETERSON AFTER BENCHING HIM YESTERDAY.
Jon: I KNEW IT! (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ACTUAL VIKINGS DON'T TREAT THEIR CHILDREN LIKE THAT. (LAUGHTER) NOW THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE METAPHORICAL 30 TO 7 BEATING THAT THE VIKINGS SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE PATRIOTS WHO, I WOULD POINT OUT, WON THE GAME WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF THEIR ALLEGEDLY DOUBLE MURDERING TIGHT END AARON HERNANDEZ. (LAUGHTER) BUT FINE. ANOTHER TYPICAL SLIMY NFL MOVE, SWEEPING THIS UNDER --
OVERNIGHT THE MINNESOTA VIKINGS REVERSED THEIR DECISION FROM MONDAY'S REINSTATING ADRIAN PETERSON AND ARE NOW BANNING THE FOOTBALL STAR FROM ALL TEAM ACTIVITIES AND ADDING WE WANT TO BE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT.
Jon: YOU WHAT? WHAT? (LAUGHTER) YOU NEED TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THIS RIGHT? A 220 POUND RUNNINGBACK LEFT A RAILROAD TRACK ON A FOUR-YEAR-OLD'S LEG. THIS AIN'T FERMAT'S LAST THEOREM, WHICH IF I MAY SAY, IS A NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT NUMEROLOGICAL PROOF CONCERNING INTEGER THEORY --  I'LL JUST GIVE MYSELF A WEDGIE. (LAUGHTER) DADDY'S HOME. ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT -- (LAUGHTER) REALLY, I JUST RE-ENACTED MY 7th GRADE YEAR. THAT WAS-- THAT WAS WEIRD. AND ODDLY CATHARTIC. SO WHAT OVERNIGHT INFORMATION CHANGED YOUR MIND THIS TIME?
THE LEAGUE'S BIGGEST PARTNER ANHEUSER-BUSCH SENT A STRONG MESSAGE SAYING WE ARE NOT YET SATISFIED WITH THE LEGAL'S HANDLING OF BEHAVIORS THAT SO CLEARLY GO AGAINST OUR OWN COMPANY CULTURE AND MORAL CODE.
Jon: WOW. (LAUGHTER) SO THE NFL SUCCUMBS TO BEER PRESSURE. THE COMPANY THAT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH I KNEW THAT WAS COMING. THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU. THAT'S FOR YOU -- HOW CRAZY IS THIS? A COMPANY THAT SELLS ALCOHOL IS THE MORAL TOUCHSTONE OF THE NFL. ALCOHOL. MAYBE ONE OF THE ONLY SUBSTANCES THAT IS PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. THAT COMPANY IS SAYING TO THE NFL, YOU GUYS GOT A REAL PROBLEM HERE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE CAPTAIN MORGAN SHOWING UP AT A FRAT PARTY GOING ARRGH MATIES, PLEASE, I'M TRYING TO SLEEP. KEEP IT DOWN. FOR THE MORNING BRINGS ME AN ORAL EXAM IN ART HISTORY. ARRGH. (LAUGHTER) ARRGH. ARRGH. BUT THE QUESTION POPS UP IN MY HEAD, WHEN I HEAR ALL THESE RUNNING AROUND AND THE NFL CHANGING THEIR POSITION AN REDOING IT AND THEN COMING BACK AND NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE DOING, IT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER. WHAT DOES A STUPID PERSON MAKE OF ALL OF THIS?
I DO BELIEVE ADRIAN PETERSON WENT TOO FAR. I WILL SAY IT AGAIN. BUT NY PROBLEM HERE IS DO PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSTILL THEIR VALUES IN THEIR CHILDREN. YOU GUYS WANT TO TELL PARENTS WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO. FOR EXAMPLE, IS IT GOING TO BECOME ILLEGAL IF A PARENT TEACHES THE POLITICALLY CORRECT VIEW THAT BEING GAY IS NOT NORMAL? (AUDIENCE BOOS)
Jon: AH, SEANY. DON'T, DON'T WORRY SEANY. SERIOUSLY, YOUR SPECIAL BRAND OF SPITEFUL IGNORANCE WILL ALWAYS BE LEGAL. (LAUGHTER) AND PROFITABLE, SO SLEEP WELL, FRIEND. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? HANNITIY ARBITRARILY CONNECTED HOMOPHOBIA DOES REMIND ME OF SOMETHING.
THE RAMS HAD TO KNOW THAT DRAFTING MICHAEL SAM WOULD CREATE A DISTRACTION.
WELL, THERE IS NO QUESTION THIS IS A DISTRACTION.
HERE'S SOME OF MICHAEL SAM'S POTENTIAL TEAMMATES CALLING THE WHOLE THING A DISTRACTION.
Jon: REMEMBER THOSE DAYS? HOW SCARED THE NFL WAS BACK THEN, THAT A GAY MAN WOULD RUIN THEIR LEAGUE. OOOH! OH, WHAT THE NFL WOULDN'T DO RIGHT NOW FOR THAT KIND OF DISTRACTION. (LAUGHTER) MY GUESS IS RIGHT NOW AT THE NFL'S OFFICE, THEY ARE WORKING NIGHT AND DAY, DAY AND NIGHT ON A LEAGUE-WIDE BLOW A TEAMMATE PROMOTION. (LAUGHTER) JUST TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION. I TELL YOU, IF THE NFL'S PR GUYS ARE WORTH ANYTHING, AND THEY'RE NOT, THEY WOULD MAKE THIS THE COVER OF NEXT YEAR'S MADDEN. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
