Jon: THANK YOU. JOURNALISTS, WE RELY ON THEM TO EXPOSE CORRUPTION, AND HOLD THE POWERFUL ACCOUNTABLE, OH, NOT ANY MORE? OKAY. WELL, AT LEAST THERE ARE SOME JOURNALISTS STILL TRYING TO ELEVATE THE DISCOURSE IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY. JOHN OLIVER HAS MORE.
Reporter: THE TONE OF OUR NATION'S DISCOURSE HAS NEVER BEEN COARSER.
ISLAM IS A I WILL FROM THE PIT OF HELL.
ATISTS ARE PARASITES.
THIS IS JUSTICE.
HEY, RUSH Y DON'T YOU WRAP YOUR FAT ASS IN THE FLAG-- .
Reporter: FORTUNATELY THERE'S A NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDITORIAL WRITERS. A CONSORTIUM OF JOURNALISTS DEVOTED TO EL FATE-- ELEVATING THE WAY WE KMAUN KATE WITH A MUCH  NEEDED CIVILITY PROJECT. IT'S PRESIDENT --
WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE BETTER ARGUMENTS. WE WANT TO SUPPORT A HIGHER QUALITY OF DISCOURSE.
RIGHT.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE IN THE CONVERSATION THAT  MAKE SENSE, THAT ARE CIVIL AND IN WHICH THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL PERSONALLY ATTACKED.
RIGHT. PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO TONE IT THE [BLEEP] DOWN. (LAUGHTER)
WELL.
AND IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE SCREAM ON TV. COLUMNISTS ARE SCREAMING IN NEWSPAPERS IN EVERY CITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WENT TO SPEAK TO A SYNDICATED COLUMNIST WHO LABELED THE TEA PARTY TERRORISTS AND AL QAEDA  BOMBERS IN RESPONSE TO THEIR ACTIONS DURING THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE. SORRY, THIS IS-- THERE MUST BE IS SOME MISTAKE HERE. I'M LOOKING FOR THE COLUMN INIST THAT WROTE THAT THE TEA PARTIES WERE ECONOMIC TERRORISTS.
YOU'RE SPEAKING TO HER. SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
WHAT?
I CALLED THEM TERRORISTS BECAUSE THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A HOSTAGE-TAKING SITUATION.
ISN'T CALLING A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT POLITICAL VIEWS TO YOU  ECONOMIC TERRORISTS A LITTLE BIT UNCIVIL.
NOT IN MY OPINION.
RIGHT.
ANYONE CAN USE COLOURFUL LANGUAGE BUT BE LOGICAL, AND FACTUAL.
SO WHAT IS YOUR EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEM BEING TERRORISTS.
WELL, BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY GOT CLOSE TO DRIVING OUR ECONOMY OVER A CLIFF.
SO THEY WEREN'T LITERAL TERRORISTS, THEY WERE MET FOR KALTER RESTS.
NO, I DO USE TOUGH METAPHORS BUT THAT WASN'T-- I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN  THAT AS A METAPHOR.
HOW COULD THE PRESIDENT OF A CIVILITY PROJECT ALSO BE A COLUMN IN-- COLUMNIST  WHO CALLS THESE AMERICANS TERRORISTS BECAUSE OF THEIR ECONOMIC VIEWS. SOMETHING DIDN'T ADD UP.
DO YOU HAVE A SISTER.
I DO.
DOES SHE LOOK EXACTLY LIKE YOU AND IS ALSO CALLED --
NO, AND NO.
RIGHT. DOW WANT TO EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.
GO AHEAD.
THERE HAD TO BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS. I WENT BACK TO THE HEAD OF THE CIVILITY PROJECT.
HI, ME AGAIN. SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. WHEN EXACTLY WERE YOU PRESIDENT OF THE CIVILITY PROJECT?
I HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT OF IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW.
ABOUT A YEAR, THIS YEAR.
YES.
THAT'S GREAT, THANKS.
OKAY, BACK TO THE FIREBRAND COLUMNIST.
HI, SORRY ABOUT THAT. JUST HAD TO CHECK SOMETHING. SO WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU WRITE THE COLUMN.
OVER THE SUMMER.
OF THIS YEAR.
YES.
HOLD ON. HI, I'M SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. I KNOW YOU'VE GOT LOTS TO DO. DO YOU HAVE A VACATION FROM THE CIVILITY PROJECT IN THE SUMMER AT ALL.
I DID TAKE IT ONE THIS SUMMER.
THANKS, VERY MUCH.
OKAY. SO THAT DOES CHECK OUT. SO MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.
WELL, I AM AN EDITORIAL WRITER. I'M A COLUMNIST, I'M ALLOWED TO USE COLOURFUL LANGUAGE. WE ARE ENTERTAINERS AS WELL AS INFORMERS.
RIGHT. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO DO IT.
YES.
AND WHAT DOES THE TEA PARTYIST SAY.
THE TEA PARTY OBJECTED TO ME CALLING THEM TERRORISTS. A LOT OF THEM DON'T RECOGNIZE IRONY OR HUMOR.
THAT IS WHAT THEY DON'T, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I FEEL A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T.
YEAH, THEY JUST DON'T GET IRONY.
THEY DON'T GET IT, NO.
EVEN WHEN THERE IS ALMOST A DIRXARY DEFINITION OF IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.
ABSOLUTELY.
I REALLY ADMIRE HOW UNDERSTANDING ARE YOU TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT  OPINIONS TO YOU SUCH AS YOURSELF.
YEAH.
HOW THE [BLEEP] COULD I GET THROUGH TO BOTH OF HER. SO APPARENTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE JUST NAME CALLING FOR NO REAL REASON. HOW CAN I GET THEM TO TONE DOWN THE LANGUAGE.
BY SAYING THAT SOME OF THIS NAME CALLING IS NOT MAKING THEM SOUND INTELLIGENT.
JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT.
YEAH.
REALLY?
THAT WOULDN'T BE RUDE.
HOW ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?
I ACTUALLY KNOW SOMEONE WHO COULD REALLY DO WITH HEARING THAT. DOW MIND, EXCUSE ME.
NO, GO AHEAD. (LAUGHTER)
SOME OF THIS NAME CALLING IS NOT MAKING YOU SOUND INTELLIGENT.
YOU CAN SAY THAT, YES. YOU WILL PROBABLY INSULT THEM AND THEY WILL PROBABLY FIGHT BACK BUT-- THAT IS THE TERRITORY.
WHAT IF THEY DON'T FIGHT BACK. THEY JUST GET INTO THIS WEIRD DISPLACEMENT.
YOU MEAN --
MEANING THAT THEY KIND OF DON'T ENGAGE IN WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID TO THEM, INSTEAD  THEY KEEP DEALING IN HYPOTHETICALS, WHAT DO I DO THEN?
WELL, YOU CHAIN THEM NEWSPAPER A ROOM AND YOU YELL AT THEM FOR AN HOUR.
RIGHT. WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A CHAIN?
WELL, LOCK THEM IN A CAR.
RIGHT, YEAH. I MEAN COY RENT A CAR BUT IT WILL TAKE HOURS.
THAT'S TRUE. WELL, THERE MUST BE OTHER PLACES YOU CAN DO IT IN, I DON'T KNOW, AN ELEVATOR.
WELL, SHE WAS THE EXPERT. IF THIS ISN'T WORK, NOTHING WOULD.
OKAY. HERE WE ARE. LUDICROUSLY OVERBLOWN COMMENTS JUST MAKE YOU LOOK STUPID.
THAT'S MY POINT.
NO, REALLY?
REALLY.
AND WHAT IS EVEN THAT DOESN'T GO IN.
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
NOTHING AT ALL.
NOPE.
OKAY, RIGHT, I'M OUT. I'M OUT. I'M OUT.
