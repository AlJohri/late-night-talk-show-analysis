JUNE 20th, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST FORMER NEW ORLEANS MAYOR RAY NAGIN. THANKS FOR JOINING US. MY GUEST THE FORMER NEW ORLEANS MAYOR RAY NAGIN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JERRY LEWIS, ALL RIGHT. INTERESTING WEEKEND. SPENT TIME IN OUR NATION'S CAPITOL. TOOK ANOTHER CLASSIC PHOTO OF MYSELF IN FRONT OF THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HELLO! THE ONLY QUESTION NOW I GUESS IS WHO SHOULD I TWITTER THAT TO? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ANYWAY I STOPPED BY THE OLD FOX NEWS SUNDAY, SAID I HAD TO MY FRIEND CHRIS WALLACE. WE I THOUGHT HAD A PROVOCATIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MEDIA. I SUGGESTED THAT THE TRUE BIAS OF THE MAINSTREAM NEWS IS NOT PARTICULARLY LIBERAL  BUT TOWARDS SENSATIONALISM AND CONFLICT OR AS THE HUFFINGTON POST PUT IT, YOU'RE INSANE! (LAUGHTER) HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WHAT, WHAT FONT WOULD YOU USE WHEN MAN LANDS ON MARS? LIKE--  (LAUGHTER) I GUESS IN THAT CASE ARIANNA JUST HAS TO GO DOOR-TO-DOOR  TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES, RING THEIR BELL AND GO CLICK ON ME, I HAVE NEWS! (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, WE HAD TO RE-CREATE THAT PAGE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS APPARENTLY THE MOST  IMPORTANT NEWS EVER, THEY TOOK IT DOWN LIKE AN HOUR LATER SO WE COULDN'T GET A SCREEN SHOT. ANYWAY, A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW. ONE, I SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT THE UNEDITED VERSION ON-LINE WHERE MY EMOTIONAL STATES  DON'T SEEM TO CHANGE SO ARBITRARILY. (LAUGHTER) THE ARGUMENTS ARE A LITTLE CLEARER AND A LITTLE LESS FROM A SCENE OF WOMAN ON THE  VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. SAD CLOWN, HAPPY CLOWN. MAD CLOWN. AND TWO, THE UNEDITED VERSION WHICH IS ON THE WEB HAD WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE  TAKE AWAY MOMENT OF THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW. WHERE CHRIS WALLACE ONE OF THE MORE RESPECTED INDIVIDUALS AT FOX BASICALLY GIVES AWAY THE GAME.
YOU BELIEVE THAT FOX NEWS IS EXACTLY THE IDEAOLOGICAL EQUIVALENT-- OF NBC NEWS.
I THINK WE'RE THE COUNTERWEIGHT.
YOU BELIEVE THAT --
I THINK THEY HAVE A LIBERAL AGENDA AND WE TELL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY.
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY. WE DON'T-- WE DON'T TELL BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY. WE TELL ONE SIDE.
THE OTHER SIDE, THE ONE WE PERCEIVE IS NEVER TOLD. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW--  (APPLAUSE)
NEWS ONLY COMES IN TWO SIDES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND IF THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE ISN'T BEING TOLD, WHAT'S BEING  TOLD MUST BE LIBERAL. FOX NEWS ISN'T FAIR AND BALANCED, IT'S BALANCING THE SYSTEM, MAN. DON'T YOU GET IT! THE SYSTEM'S UNFAIR AND UNBALANCED! TO BALANCE THE SYSTEM, FOX HAS TO BE THE PURIST FORM OF RIGHT WING RESIN BECAUSE OF  HOW-- BECAUSE OF HOW HEAVY LEFT WING AMERICA IS. HOLLYWOOD, COMEDIANS, EVERY SINGLE NEWS ORGANIZATION, THE INTERNET, FACT, HISTORY, SCIENCE, IT'S ALL JUST LEFT WING BULL [BLEEP], MAN! EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS DESIGNED PURELY TO SHUT DOWN CONSERVATIVES. BUT DON'T WORRY, FOX ISN'T GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN. IT'S FOX UNBALANCED? YEAH. SERIOUSLY LIKE THEIR EARS ARE NEARLY TOUCHING THE FLOOR. BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM'S UNBALANCED. (LAUGHTER) MOVING ON. YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S JUST GIVE IT BACK TO THE REAL NEWS SINCE THAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE. ANTHONY WEINER STEPPED DOWN LAST THURSDAY LEAVING MOST OBSERVERS WONDERING WHAT ARE  WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH OUR GIANT DILDO WHEEL. (LAUGHTER) WHOSE'S GOING TO BUY IT NOW? OF COURSE, WE AT THE DAILY SHOW ARE NOT AROUND TO COVER THE NEWS CONFERENCE. BUT LUCKILY THE 24 HOURS STEP INTO THE BREACH WHENEVER THE DAILY SHOW IS  ON ASSIGNMENT, I HAPPENED TO BE IN A HOTEL ROOM IN D.C. AT THE TIME SO OBVIOUSLY I WAS READING THE BIBLE WHILE HI CNN ON ON THE BACKGROUND. THEIR ANTICIPATION WAS PALPABLE.
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAR FROM NANCY PELOSI IN JUST ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
WHEN YOU SEE LEADER PELOSI IN A MOMENT.
I CAN SEE KATE BALDWIN THERE AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE GETTING READY, I UNDERSTAND  THAT NANCY PELOSI IS IN THE ROOM.
Jon: I WONDER IF SHE'S GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN! (LAUGHTER) FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WILL BE GIVING HER REGULARLY SCHEDULED PRESS AVAILABILITY. OH [BLEEP],IT'S ON!
NANCY PELOSI NOW ADDRESSING THE ANTHONY WEINER SCANDAL.
GOOD MORNING, AS USUAL WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT JOBS, ABOUT PROTECTING  MEDICARE, AND TO PROTECTING THE MIDDLE CLASS. IF YOU ARE HERE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT CONGRESSMAN WEINER, I WON'T BE ANSWERING ANY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE ECONOMY, JOBS? NO WEINER TALK? THE ECONOMY AND JOBS ARE IMPORTANT. LET'S GIVE IT A CHANCE.
I WILL JUST TELL YOU THAT UP FRONT. IT IS DAY 163, 163 DAYS SINCE THE REPUBLICAN --
ALL RIGHT, I ACTUALLY SAW JOHN KEANE SORT OF GRINNING MAYBE BECAUSE HE SORT CHED  MUCH EXPECTED THAT AND DANA BASH, YOU TOO ON THE HILL. WE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY NANCY PELOSI WOULD TAKE QUESTIONS RIGHT AWAY, CONSIDERING THE STORIES THAT'S BEEN BREAKING FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES NOW. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE NOPE, SHE'S GOING TO START WITH JOBS THE MIDDLE CLASS.
Jon: LAST TRAIN, SNOOZEVILLE IS LEAVING. YOU'RE BORING ME STATION. THE OTHER 24 FAIRED NO BETTER, BOTH FOX AND MSNBC ALSO CUTTING AWAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT BECAME  CLEAR THIS WOULD BE A WEINERLESS PICNIC.
IT IS DAY 163, 163 DAYS SINCE THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE.
ALL RIGHT SO, NANCY PELOSI-- SAYING SHE IS NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY COMMENT ON  ANTHONY WEINER'S RESIGNATION.
Jon: DID YOU CATCH THAT, THAT WAS MSNBC, WITH THEIR LIBERAL BIAS, THEY LET NANCY PELOSI SAY EIGHT MORE WORDS THAN CNN. (LAUGHTER) BASTARDS! MY FAVORITE MOMENT OF THE AFTERNOON HAD TO BELONG TO OUR GOOD FRIEND WOLF BLITZER  WHO 30 MINUTES AFTER CNN BAILED ON THE PELOSI JOBS SPEECH BITTERLY COMPLAINED ABOUT, WELL, LISTEN.
WE HAVE COVERED THESE KINDS OF STORIES. IT'S NOT A PLEASURE FOR US. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE LOOK FORWARD TO. I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE DISCUSSING ECONOMIC ISSUES, JOBS, THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE, NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.
ABSOLUTELY.
THEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT? WAIT, WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING YOU. WHAT IS STOPPING YOU FROM DOING THAT?
YOU KNOW, SUZANNE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE ITCHING ON MY FACE IS NAIRLY UNBEARABLE. MY VESAGE IN A MIRROR IS NOT SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING. I WOULD MUCH RATHER MY FINGERS BE RUNNING AGAINST A SMOOTH AND CLEAN SKIN  SURFACE BUT, OBVIOUSLY I'M 23409 A FAITION HAIR GOD-- A FACIAL HAIR GOD. I'M HELPLESS TO REMOVE IT. (LAUGHTER) SO WERE ECONOMIC ISSUES DISCUSSED AT ALL THIS WEEKEND? OF COURSE THEY WERE AND LUCKY FOR US OUR TROUBLED JOB MARKET AND DEFICIT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE MOST  STRIKINGLY COMIC WAY POSSIBLE ON THE GOLF COURSE. WHERE BARACK OBAMA, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER  AND FOR SOME REASON OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH TOOK TO THE LINKS TO DISCUSS WHAT  SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE POOR. LOOK AT THEM. LOOK AT THIS PICTURE. IF YOU WERE DESIGNING AN EDITORIAL CARTOON ABOUT OUT OF TOUCH WASHINGTON INSIDERS  DISCUSSING A FAILING ECONOMY, YOU WOULD PUT THEM ON A GOLF COURSE AND THEN CROSS IT OUT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO CLICHED. TOO ON THE NOSE. YOU WOULD SAY TO YOURSELF IT'S LIKE THEY'RE POSING FOR  THEIR OWN "NEW YORK POST" PAGE 6 CARTOON. (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE "THE NEW YORK POST" WOULD NOT MAKE A CARTOON OF BARACK OBAMA  HAVING SEX WITH JOHN BOEHNER WHILE POINTING TO A SHEEP. WE ACTUALLY MADE THAT CARTOON. BUT DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU POLITICAL HUMOR IS A GUYING ART. POOR OPTIC AS SIDE, WHY WOULD JOHN BOEHNER AGREE TO GO GOLFING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM TO PLAY GOLF, IT'S THE PRESIDENT. YOU DON'T SAY NO TO THE PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT? DO YOU FOLLOW POLITICS? (LAUGHTER)
THE PRESIDENT IN PRIVATE DIRECTLY ASKED THE SPEAKER FOR WHAT THEY CALL A CLEAN VOTE. SPEAKER BOEHNER SAID NO WAY.
THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO BRING REPRESENTATIVES TO THE WHITE HOUSE. BOEHNER SAID NO.
JOHN BOEHNER SAYING NO TO THE STATE DINNER INVITATION.
SPEAKER BOEHNER TURNS DOWN ANOTHER INVEIGH TRACE FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Jon: OH, I GUESS YOU DIDN'T SAY NO TO THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE ARE YOU OUT OF NOs. YOUR NO CUP IS NOW EMPTY FOR ALL THE NOING YOU SAY, ALWAYS. BUT WHO KNOWS, MAYBE NEXT ROUND OF GOLF IS ALL IT TAKES TO BREAK THE TENSION  BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CONGRESS. WE ALL KNOW HOW RELAXING GOLF CAN BE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE ODD YOF THEIR GAME.
JOHN, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THERE'S A COMPROMISE TO BE-- [BLEEP].
WELL, I THINK WE COULD FIND AN AGREEMENT ON THE PROVISION [BLEEP].
Jon: WE COULD HAVE A RES LUIG OF THE-- BUT A DUCK SHOT AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO
