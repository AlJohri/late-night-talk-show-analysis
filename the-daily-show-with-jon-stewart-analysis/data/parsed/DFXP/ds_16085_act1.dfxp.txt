JUNE 29, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE GOT A BIG ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MR. TOM HANKS. HE IS MAN SO LIKABLE, SO POLITE THAT HIS NAME ACTUALLY CONTAINS THE WORD "THANKS."  [LAUGHTER] IT'S RIGHT IN IT. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ECONOMY, WHICH, AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE, SUCKS. [LAUGHTER] RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING TO PAY DOWN $14.3 TRILLION OF DEBT. [AUDIENCE REACTS] [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY I'M READING A SCARY STORY TO MY CHILDREN. THEY'RE GOING TO DO ALL THE NOISES LIKE IT'S "PETER AND THE  [BLEEPED] WOLF OR SOMETHING." WE'RE GOING TO PAY DOWN $14. TRILLION OF DEBT WITH A ECONOMY STRUGGLING TO PRODUCE JOBS, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE  AMERICAN WORKERS STILL STUBBORNLY CLING TO THE IDEA THAT THEY SHOULD BE MORE HIGHLY  COMPENSATED THAN SAY SUICIDAL CHINESE COMPUTER PART FACTORY HELP. [LAUGHTER] IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH OF THESE DESPONDENT PEOPLE, WELL, NOT TO WORRY, PEOPLE.
I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE ECONOMY BEFORE I TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS.
Jon: ECONOMY PRESS CONFERENCE. HOORAY! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO WHAT DO WE DO, BOSS?
THE STRUGGLES OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WERE A BIG PROBLEM BEFORE THE RECESSION HIT IN 2007. THEY WEREN'T CREATED OVERNIGHT, AND THE TRUTH IS OUR ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ARE NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT.
Jon: BUT BY MONDAY... [LAUGHTER] MONDAY? YOU GOT A PLAN?
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND URGENT THINGS WE CAN DO FOR THE  ECONOMY IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, AND THAT'S REDUCING OUR  NATION'S DEFICIT.
Jon: PHEW. WELL, THANK GOD WE KNOW WHAT TO DO, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOO HARD, RIGHT?
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TACKLE SPENDING IN THE TAX CODE TO MAKE  IT EASIER FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO PATENT A NEW PRODUCT, REBUILDING OUR TRANSPORTATION STRUCTURE, ELIMINATE WASTE, TACKLE ENTITLEMENT, EXTEND THOSE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS, HELP  BUSINESSES CREATE JOBS. WE GOT TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT, AND WE HAVE TO SEIZE IT SOON. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT? OF COURSE, THE FIRST THING BEFORE WE GET TO ANY OF THAT STUFF... [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHY WE GET PAID THE CABLE MONEY. [LAUGHTER] THE FIRST THING WE DO BEFORE WE GET TO ANY OF THAT GOOD FIXING THE ECONOMY STUFF, DEMOCRATS SAY  WE HAVE TO RAISE AMERICA'S $14.3 TRILLION DEBT CEILING BEFORE AUGUST 2nd, BECAUSE IF WE  DON'T DO THAT, UH, WAIT, WHAT HAPPENS AGAIN?
ARMAGEDDON.
ARMAGEDDON.
ARM GETTEN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO, THAT WASN'T IT. NO, NO, NO, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT, TOTAL COLLAPSE OF OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM. BUT THAT'S JUST THE PREREQUISITE TO ENACTING ANY OF THOSE OTHER SOLUTIONS THE PRESIDENT WAS  TALKING ABOUT. I'M SORRY, REPUBLICANS, YOU WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
IF ALL WE DO IS EXTEND THE DEBT LIMIT AND DO NOT START DEALING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL  FACT THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT SPENDS MONEY IT DOESN'T HAVE.
Jon: YES, NO, NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND. ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT...
TAX INCREASES ARE OFF THE TABLE.
Jon: OH. WELL, YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY TWO WAYS TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT. YOU CAN CUT SPENDING OR RAISE TAXES. YOU TAKE ONE OF THOSE OFF THE TABLE COMPLETELY, YOU'RE NOT REALLY NEGOTIATING. IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE, BUT I WON'T DO THAT."  YOU REALLY WOULDN'T THEN DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE. SO I QUESTIONS WHAT I'M SAYING IS MEATLOAF'S PREMISE IS FAULTY IS WHAT I'M SAYING. [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE THE DEMOCRATS COUNTER-OFFERING?
IT ALMOST MAKES YOU WONDER IF THEY AREN'T TRYING TO SLOW DOWN  THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FOR POLITICAL GAIN.
Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO WE HAVE, UNTIL AUGUST 2nd BEFORE WE HIT ARMAGEDDON. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU AGREE ON?
THEY'RE NOT DEALING IN REALITY
MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS SEEM TO BE LIVING IN A FANTASY WORLD.
Jon: OH, ALL RIGHT. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, HARRY REID, IF THEY'RE LIVING IN A FANTLY WORLD, WOULD YOU STILL EXIST? [LAUGHTER] WELL, ONE THING IS CLEAR, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ARMAGEDDON, HERE WE COME. EACH PARTY SAYS THE OTHER IS LEADING US TO ARMAGEDDON. IS EITHER OF THEM BEING SLIGHTLY HYPERBOLIC? FOR MORE WE GO TO THE FUTURE WITH SAMANTHA BEE IV AND AASIF MANDVI, JR.,, JR.,, JR., IN  WASHINGTON, D.C. HELLO, GUYS.
HELLO, JON.
GLEEP GLOOP GLOP.
Jon: OH, MY GOSH, IS ENGLISH NO LONGER IN USE?
OF COURSE IT IS. I'M JUST [BLEEPED] WITH YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE IN THE FUTURE WHERE REPUBLICANS DID NOT RAISE THE DEBT CEILING. ARE WE IN TROUBLE IN
NOT REALLY. REPUBLICANS GOT EVERYTHING THEY WANTED. AMERICA DECLARED BANKRUPTCY AND IN RECEIVERSHIP RESTRUCTURED OUR GOVERNMENT AND WE GOT THIS  CAPITALIST YOU OPEN THEA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IS THIS AIR BREATHABLE?
IT STINGS A LITTLE, BUT THE FREE MARKET WILL CORRECT IT. YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY, FOR SURE.
Jon: ASSIF, TELL ME ABOUT THE FUTURE THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN.
WELL, HERE THE DEMOCRATS SUCCESSFULLY RAISED THE DEBT CEILING AND INCREASED TAXES  WITHOUT CUSHING SOCIAL PROGRAMS.
Jon: I GOT THE TELL YOU, I GOT TO TELL YOU, SEEING THAT, A LITTLE BIT OF A RELIEF. IT REALLY DOES LOOK GREAT.
OH, WHAT THIS BACKGROUND?
Jon: YEAH.
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT-ISSUED SIMU-SCREEN MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2033. USUALLY IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL. THAT'S IT. THERE IT IS. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ASSIF, THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME ENVIRONMENT THAT'S IN SAM'S FUTURE.
NO, NO, SAM IS FACING CANCEROUS POLLUTANTS. THIS IS A RADIATION CLOUD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, WE RAISED THE DEBT CEILING, BORROWED MORE THAN WE COULD REPAY, AND WHEN CHINA  DEMANDED THEIR MONEY BACK, THERE WAS A REPO SITUATION. LONG STORY SHORT, WE NUKED THEM, THEY NUKED US AND HAVE SINCE BEEN AT WAR WITH THEIR NEW ARMY OF RADIOACTIVE PANDAS. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO LIVE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL, SOCIALIST PARADISE.
Jon: SO NEITHER REPUBLICANS NOR DEMOCRATS WERE IN ANY WAY EXAGGERATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF  EACH OTHER'S POLICIES.
NO, NO, IN FACT, UNDERSELLING, OR AS OUR GLORIOUS CHAIRMAN BOBO WOULD SAY [MAKING CHIMP NOISES] ALL HAIL BOBO.
OH, PLEASE, SAVAGES. THANK GOD THE LAISSEZ FAIRE POLICIES OF OUR DEAR PRESIDENT FIELD MARSHAL BOBO HAVE  PROTECTED US AS HE SO ELOQUENTLY STATED IN HIS STATE OF THE  [MAKING CHIMP NOISES]
Jon: I THINK THAT LAST PARTED WAS A FECES THROW FOR EMPHASIS.
VERY EXPRESSIVE.
Jon: NO MATTER WHICH PARTY GAINS TUPPER HAND IN 2011, IT LEADS TO A DYSTOPIA IN AMERICA  GOVERNED BY APES.
BOTH: YES.
Jon: NO THIRD OPTION MIGHT LEAD TO THAT NOT HAPPENING?
BOTH: NO.
