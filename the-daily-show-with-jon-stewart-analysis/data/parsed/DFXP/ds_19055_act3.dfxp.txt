Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JOHNNY KNOXVILLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LET ME SAY SOMETHING. LET ME APOLOGIZE TO YOU. LET ME APOLOGIZE.
FOR WHAT?
NO, PLEASE.
ARE YOU GOING TO THROW ME OFF A (bleep) BALCONY?
Jon: WHAT AM I CONGRESSMAN? NO. [ LAUGHTER ] I INTRODUCED YOU IMPROPERLY. JONNY KNOXVILLE FROM THE OSCAR NOMINATED FILM BAD GRANDPA. YOU WERE NOMINATED FOR -- IS THIS THE FIRST OSCAR THAT ONE OF YOUR FILMS HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR. YES, IT IS, JON. THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
Jon: BUT IT'S TRUE, YES?
YEAH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, BABY.
THE MAKEUP GUYS WHO WORKED ON THE FILM GOT NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR AND I THINK THEY DESERVE TO WIN BECAUSE WITHOUT THE MAKEUP OF THIS FILM THERE'S NO FILM BECAUSE I CANNOT PRANK PEOPLE AS MYSELF. YES, THAT'S TRUE.
Jon: HERE IS WHY I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THAT. THEY DID A GREAT  JOB AND I RESPECT THEM AND I'M GLAD THEY GOT THAT BUT THAT OLD MAN DOESN'T COME TO LIFE IF IT'S NOT FOR THE ACTING, THE MAN INSIDE. IF THEY GET IT FOR BEING THE OLD MAN MAKEUP, I THINK WE COULD SEE A NOMINATION IN THE FUTURE.
I'M SURE THAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THIS WAS BETTER THOUGH. YOU KNOW, DO YOU THINK YOU'LL DO MORE -- AT A CERTAIN POINT THE BODY IS GOING TO BREAK DOWN. YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH MORE CHARACTERS.
I WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE WHEN I STARTED DOING STUNTS AND I'M IN TERRIBLE SHAPE NOW. I CAN KEEP DOING STUNTS BECAUSE MY BODY SO WRECKED PERIOD. IT'S DONE BUT I STILL LIKE DOING STUNTS.
Jon: DO YOU EVER GO IN FOR A FULL BODY MRI JUST TO SEE. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DID -- I WENT TO A DOCTOR THE OTHER DAY AND THEY TOOK SOME THINGS. I WENT IN FOR MY HAND AND HAD A FRACTURED ELBOW AND A TORN SHOULDER. IT WAS LIKE THREE OR FOUR THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD.
Jon: HOW DO THEY BREAK THAT KIND OF NEWS TO YOU?
WELL, THEY THINK IT'S KIND OF HUMOROUS. THEY THINK IT'S -- YOU KNOW, HE'S A GOOD CUSTOMER. [LAUGHTER] THAT KIND OF -- THEY'LL BRING ANOTHER DOCTOR IN THE OFFICE. THIS GUY HAS ALL THIS GOING ON. I'M LIKE CAN I HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION SO I CAN LEAVE? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BECAUSE YOU SET THIS UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT ONE DAY THEY'LL VAPORIZE INSIDE YOU AND YOU'LL BE LYING IN A PUDDLE AFTER THEY THREW YOU OFF A BUILDING AND EVERYBODY WILL WALK BY AND GO, YOU, YOU KILL ME. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU FEEL GOOD NOW?
OH, YES.
Jon: DO PEOPLE MAKE YOU -- IF YOU ARE OUT IN A BAR DO PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU AND SAY MAN CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK AND HIT YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH THE BOTTLE? WHAT IS THE DIFFICULTY THERE FOR YOU?
THEY USED TO TRY TO FIGHT ME ALL THE TIME.
Jon: FIGHT YOU?
YEAH, THE GUYS WOULD TRY TO FIGHT ME BUT GIRLS WOULD PUT CIGARETTES OUT ON MY ARM. I HAD ONE PUT IT OUT ON MY FACE. I HAD ONE GIRL SAY I LOVE WHAT YOU DO AND PUNCHED ME IN THE NOSE. GUYS WOULD TRY TO PUNCH OR TRY TO FIGHT.
Jon: AND YOU STILL GO OUT?
NOT AS MUCH AS I USED TO.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
THESE DAYS THEY WANT ME TO HIT THEM. THEY GO, I LOVE WHAT YOU DO. WILL YOU HIT ME IN THE NUTS? LIKE OF COURSE NOT.
Jon: THAT'S GOOD. OUT OF CURIOSITY, HOW LONG AFTER I LOVE WHAT YOU DO DO THEY GET TO WILL YOU HIT ME IN THE NUTS?
IMMEDIATELY.
Jon: INSTANTLY. NO FOREPLAY NO NOTHING. NO CHARMING I LOVE WHAT YOU DO, ONE OF BEST MOVIES. I LIKE TO DO STUNTS OH, WOULD YOU MIND HITTING ME IN THE NUTS.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
Jon: THEY FORCE THE ISSUE. DO YOU HIT THEM?
NO, NO. I DON'T HIT THEM. IF ONE OF THE GUYS IS THERE.
Jon: ONE OF JACKASS GUYS?
YEAH. IF THEY ASK THEM I'M LIKE YOU GUYS CAN HIT THEM I'M NOT HITTING THEM.
Jon: DO THEY SAY NO, NO, NO, I WANT KNOXVILLE TO HIT ME IN THE NUTS. I DON'T WANT THESE OTHER GUYS.
WEE MAN WILL OBLIGE.
Jon: THAT'S WHY, I THOUGHT FOR ME OH, YOU KNOW, SURE I'LL TAKE A PICTURE BUT I'VE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY -- NOBODY HAS EVER --
YOU NEVER GOT TO HIT ANYONE.
Jon: NOT THE NUTS.
WHAT THE HELL, GO AHEAD.
Jon: REALLY? THAT IS AT A CERTAINLY POINT THAT'S GOT TO -- YOU JUST WANTED SOME CHICKEN WINGS FOR GOD SAKES.
JUST LOOKING FOR A HOT MEAL AT A GOOD PRICE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. JACKASS PRESENTS BAD GRANDPA IT'S ON THE BLU RAY AND DVD. DO YOU HAVE MORE COMING OUT? A SEQUEL?
NOT YET. I PITCHED ONE TO YOU AN OLD MAN WHO WANDERS THE STREETS OF NEW YORK HITTING PEOPLE IN THE NUTS.
