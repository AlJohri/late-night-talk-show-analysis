Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF OUR GREATEST COMEDIANS, ACTORS, DIRECTORS, WRITERS, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "STILL FOOLIN' EM: WHERE I'VE BEEN, WHERE I'M GOING AND WHERE THE HELL ARE MY KEYS?" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, MR. BILLY CRYSTAL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND THE CROWD GOES WILD, THEY GO WILD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOW ARE YOU, JON.
Jon: I'M SO WELL. HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND?
NICE TO SEE YOU.
I'M GREAT.
Jon: THE BOOK IS SO GOOD.
OH, THANK YOU.
Jon: I READ THESE MEMOIRS. MY IMAGE OF YOU IS ALWAYS AS THE ICONIC BILLY CRYSTAL. I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN YOU AS THAT GUY IN THE MOVIES.
YOU MEAN SEPHARTIC.
BUT TO READ THE STORIES FROM YOUR EARLY DAYS IN YOUR CAREER, STRUGGLING AND DISAPPOINTMENT, IT REMINDS ME THAT NO MATTER WHERE WE GET TO WE ALL COME FROM THE SAME PLACE.
ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT WAS THE JOY IN WRITING THE BOOK WAS, WELL, THE FIRST BIG JOY WAS REMEMBERING EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER)
AND THEN GETTING IT OUT AND REALIZING LIKE YOU SAID, WE'RE ALL ALONE TOGETHER, I THINK LILY TOMLIN SAID, THAT OUR PATHS ARE VERY SIMILAR. REMEMBERING ALL THE STUFF FROM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID, OF COURSE, BUT WHEN YOU START WORKING CLUBS AND OPENING FOR ACTS AND, WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T BE AND WHERE YOU SHOULD BE, YOU REALIZE YOU HAVE A LIFE. AND THE BOOK IS MORE THAN JUST FUNNY STUFF IT HAS A LOT OF HEART TO IT.
Jon: I LOVE THE IDEA OF WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED-- BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS I THINK IS THE BAND YOU OPENED FOR.
OH IT WAS HILARIOUS. IT WAS ONE OF MY FIRST. CAN I TALK TO THEM TOO?
Jon: YES (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I COULD GO SIT OUT THERE AND YOU COULD JUST TALK TO US ALL.
OKAY. I'M OPENING FOR BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS WHICH WAS A REALLY HOT BAND AT THE TIME. SPINNING WHEEL AND THE LEAD SINGER WAS DAVID CLAYTON THOMAS WHO WAS THE GREAT GUY. IT'S ONE OF MY FIRST JOBS-- I'M GETTING $125 BUCKS, I'M IN SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA, I HAVE NO BILLING. THEY HAVE NO IDEA ANYBODY ELSE IS IN THE SHOW. AND THE AUDIENCE HAS TIMED THEIR DRUGS FOR THE HEADLINE. SO I COME OUT AND I DO YOU KNOW, REALLY WELL. BUT IT'S STILL NEW. THEY DON'T KNOW WHO I AM. I HAVEN'T BEEN ON ANYTHING. AND I DID REALLY GOOD. FINISH, BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS, BIG SONG, SPINNING WHEEL, THEY COUNT HIM DOWN, DAVID CLAYTON THOMAS WALKS OUT, HE'S MAGIC OUT THERE, HE HITS THE FIRST THREE NOTES, WHAT GOES UP-- [BLEEP] THIS, I HATE THIS, AND LEAVES THE STAGE. (LAUGHTER)
AND THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL THERE IS I WANTED TO SEE THEM FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE I HAD TO DRIVE THE FOUR HOURS HOME BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD THE HOTEL. THEIR DRUMMER LOOKS AT ME AND GOES, GO BACK OUT, GO BACK OUT.
SO I GRAB MY MIC, I GO BACK OUT AND I SAY OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU FROM? (LAUGHTER)
WHERE YOU FROM? SO NOW I CAN PATTER WITH THEM, WHERE YOU FROM, WHERE YOU FROM, TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD. I SEE FROM THE WINGS. OKAY, LET'S GO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS. BACK IN THE WINGS-- WHAT GOES-- WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THE MATTER WITH THIS THING. OFF AGAIN. AND THEY GO, GO BACK OUT. I GO, NO, I KNOW WHERE EVERYBODY'S FROM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I LOVE IT BUT THOSE WERE THE GREAT, GREAT DAYS OF WHEN COMEDIANS WEREN'T AS PLENTIFUL AS THEY ARE NOW.
RIGHT.
AND, NO IT'S TRUE.
IT IS TRUE.
IT'S VERY TRUE. NOW THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY. NO BUT IT'S TRUE. THERE WERE JUST REALLY A FEW OF US. IN MY GRADUATING CLASS, WE WERE BEFORE YOU.
YEAH. >>CATCH A RISING STAR ON  IMPROV WAS BELZER, JAY LENO, RICHARD LEWIS, AND AFTER THAT WAS PAUL REISER AND SEINFELD AND THAT GROUP.
AND THEY NEVER FORGOT TO REMIND US OF YOU GUYS HAVING BEEN THERE AND HOW GOOD YOU WERE. WE USED TO WORK THOSE CLUBS TOO, AND THEY WERE LIKE BILLY CRYSTAL ONCE TORE THIS  PLACE DOWN. AND WOULD YOU BE LIKE OH, YOU DID GOOD TOO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BUT TO THIS DAY, YOU GUYS I THINK ARE SORT OF LIKE THE REIGNING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONS OF THOSE CLUBS. I MEAN THEY STILL TALK ABOUT BELZER AND YOU AND RICHARD AND ALL THOSE GUYS, KILLING IT.
HERE'S A CRAZY STORY. AND IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH BUT HEY, I JUST DID THAT ONE.
Jon: WHATEVER.
ALL RIGHT, YOU REMEMBER LENNY SCHULTZ.
SURE, LENNY SCHULTZ WITH THE RUBBER DUCK.
HE WAS A GYM TEACHER IN QUEENS. HE WAS A MASSIVELY LARGE GUY AND VERY HAIRY AND INSANELY FUNNY ON STAGE.
Jon: REALLY FUNNY.
AND DID CRAZY STUFF. SO HIS WIFE AT THE TIME USED TO DO HIS SOUND EFFECTS BECAUSE HE DID A LOT OF MUSIC PANTOMIME AND STUFF LIKE THIS. HE COMES UP TO ME AT THE BAR AT CATCH A RISING STAR AND HE GOES YOU'RE SMART, WOULD YOU WATCH WHAT I DO AND GIVE ME SOME NOTES. (LAUGHTER) SO I GO-- .
Jon: THAT SOUNDS LIKE LENNY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE LENNY.
SO I GO OKAY, HE GOES UP ON STAGE, HE'S GOT A VIOLIN CASE AND HE YELLS AT THE AUDIENCE, HE SCREAMS AT THEM, WHEN I LOOK AT YOU AND I POINT AT YOU, YOU YELL, PLAY MAESTRO, PLAY!
AND THEY GO OKAY, LENNY. AND THEN HE OPENS THE CASE AND HE PULLS OUT A RUBBER SEX TOY. (LAUGHTER) WAIT, WAIT WITH TWO HEADS, OKAY.  THE BEST I CAN DO SO HE HAS THIS DOUBLE HEADED DONG AND HE PUTS, AND THEN HE PUTS A HUGE SET OF THOSE BAD TEETH, LIKE THIS IN HIS MOUTH, AND NOW HE PUTS THE THING UNDER AND HE POINTS TO THE AUDIENCE AND THEY YELL PLAY MAESTRO, PLAY MAESTRO AND HE POINTS TO HIS WIFE WHO THEN HITS THE MUSIC AND TURKEY IN THE STRAW COMES OUT BUT AT HIGH SPEED, AT 78. SO NOW HE'S GOT THIS BOW AND THE TEETH, ♪ ♪  HE'S BANGING IT IN PEOPLE'S DRINKS, HE TWISTS IT, TIES IT IN A KNOT AND HE FINISHES AND HE GETS A STANDING OVATION. HE COMES TO ME AND HE GOES WHAT DID YOU THINK?
AND I SAID I DON'T THINK YOU NEED THE TEETH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OH MY GOD, I LOVE THAT. WILL YOU STICK AROUND, WE'LL THROW A LITTLE BIT UP-- STICK AROUND.
I CAN JUST TELL THEM ONE OTHER THING, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO. THE AUDIO BOOK AND YOU WILL LOVE THIS I DID IT IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.
OH, REALLY.
MOST OF IT IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE. THE COMEDY ALBUMS THAT WE GREW UP ON, LENNY BRUCE, JONATHAN WINTERS, ROBERT KLEIN. I WANTED TO RE-CREATE THAT. AND SO IT'S REALLY A LOT OF FUN. I DO READ THE WHOLE BOOK BUT THE FUNNY CHAPTERS IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE, IT'S REALLY COOL.
STILL FOOLING EM ON THE BOOK SHELVES, BILLY CRYSTAL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
