(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! I AM JOHN OLIVER STILL HERE FOR  JON STEWART WHO, AT THIS HOUR,  REMAINS TRAPPED IN A CHILEAN MINE WITH 18 OTHER TALK SHOW  HOSTS. (LAUGHTER)  MY GUEST TONIGHT: THE FILMMAKER  OF A NEW DOCUMENTARY "GIDEON'S  ARMY" DAWN PORTER IS HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FANTASTIC, FANTASTIC  DOCUMENTARY. BUT LET'S START TONIGHT WITH OUR  PRESIDENT, BARACK HANK OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)  HE HAS BEEN HAVING A BIT OF A  ROUGH TIME DOMESTICALLY: FAILED  PUSH FOR GUN CONTROL, NATIONAL SECURITY LEAKS, HIS INCREASINGLY  PATHETIC JUMP SHOT. (LAUGHTER)  OR, AS IT'S KNOWN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE NOW, AIR BALL ONE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, NONE OF THIS IS MAKING HIM  PARTICULARLY POPULAR AT HOME AND  LOOK AT HIM. LOOK HOW SAD WE'VE MADE HIM. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  LOOK HOW SAD HE'S PARTIALLY MADE  HIMSELF. HE'S LOST THAT "BEING LOVED"  FEELING ANDING LIKE A FIGURE  FROM GREEK MYTHOLOGY, HE MUST TRAVEL TO FIND THAT WHICH HE HAS  LOST IN A PLACE FAR FROM HOME. THE JOURNEY BEGINS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
John: YES. YES. HE MUST FIND IT. YES, HE IS CURRENTLY IN THE  MIDST OF THE FIRST OF TWO SUMMER  TRIPS ABROAD. TODAY WITH HIS BIG SPEECH IN  WHAT I CALL "THE HAPPIEST PLACE  ON EARTH," GERMANY. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  HEY, HEY, HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT HAVE  YOU BEEN THERE? GERMANY'S ACTUALLY ALWAYS BEEN  GOOD TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. BACK IN 2008 BEFORE HE WAS EVEN  PRESIDENT 200,000 GERMANS TURNED  UP TO HEAR HIM SPEAK. A MEASUREMENT KNOWN IN GERMANY  AS HALF A HASSELHOFF CONCERT. (LAUGHTER)  OR IN GERMAN HEFTY HASSLE HALF  CONCERT! IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE. SO TO GET HIS MOJO BACK THE  PRESIDENT IS BACK IN BERLIN FOR  A BRANDENBURG PICK ME UP. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE SEX  ACT OF THE SAME NAME. (LAUGHTER)  IS HE STILL A ROCK STAR OVER  THERE?
HE'S NOT THE ROCK STAR HE WAS  WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR THE  PRESIDENCY AND HAD 200,000 PEOPLE OUT THERE SWOONING OVER  HIM. WE'RE EXPECTING WELL BELOW  10,000 TO SEE HIM TODAY.
John: WOW! LOSING 95% OF YOUR AUDIENCE IN  JUST FIVE YEARS. THAT'S BASICALLY MAKING OBAMA  THE NBC OF PRESIDENTS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S RIGHT. SO THE TRIP TO GERMANY WAS A  SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT OR, AS  THEY SAY IT IN GERMNY (SPEAKING GERMAN)  LIKE BUTNER THE MOUTH, LIKE YOUR  TONGUE IS PLYING THE VIOLIN. WHAT IS WITH THE TINY TURNOUT.
THE GERMAN PEOPLE ARE REALLY  UPSET ABOUT THE N.S.A. CONTROVERSY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A  HISTORY WITH THE SECRET POLICE,  THE STASI.
John: I GUESS THAT MAKES  SENSE! THE PRESIDENT'S WHOLE N.S.A. EXCUSE OF "WE ONLY SPY ON  FOREIGNERS" DOESN'T PLAY SO WELL  WITH -- UM, WHAT'S THE WORD? OH, FOREIGNERS. (LAUGHTER)  AND THIS SPYING THING IS REALLY  HAUNTING HIM. AND NOT JUST IN GERMANY. EARLIER THIS WEEK HE WAS IN  IRELAND FOR THE G-8 SUMMIT, AN  IMPORTANT CHANCE TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN NATIONS. BUT BEFORE THE HAND SHAKE  CEREMONY WAS EVEN OVER --
THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER THE  "GUARDIAN" HAS DROPPED YET  ANOTHER SECURITY BOMBSHELL. THE LATEST REPORT FROM THE  "GUARDIAN" FINGERS BOTH THE U.S. AND THE U.K. FOR SPYING ON  FOREIGN LEADERS.
AT THE G-20 SUMMIT IN 2009  THE BRITS EVEN SET UP FAKE  INTERNET CAFES TO STEAL E-MAIL INFORMATION FROM DELEGATES.
John: OKAY, THE BIGGEST  SHOCKER THERE: WHO WAS STILL  USING INTERNET CAFES IN 2009? (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN OLD SAYING  IN THE SPY GAME: NEVER TRANSMIT  CLASSIFIED DATA NEXT TO A HOMELESS MAN GOOGLING HIS OWN  NAME. (LAUGHTER)  NOW LUCKILY, LUCKILY THERE IS  ONE COUNTRY THAT AMERICA'S  ACTUALLY DEVELOPED GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OVER THE YEARS,  RUSSIA. YES, RUSSIA. SINCE THE COLD WAR ENDED, RUSSIA  AND THE U.S. ALWAYS HAVE FUN  WHENEVER THEY GET TOGETHER. REMEMBER GEORGE W. BUSH HANGING  OUT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN ZOOMS  AROUND IN VINTAGE CARS? OR BILL CLINTON AND BORIS  YELTSIN AFTER WHAT I CAN ONLY  IMAGINE WAS A HEAVY LIQUID LUNCH  TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER)
(CLINTONING LAUGHING)
John: PRESIDENT CLINTON  LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON THAT  DAY: NEVER GO TOE TO TOE ON VODKA SHOTS WITH A MAN NAMED  BORIS. (LAUGHTER)  SO MAYBE SOME FACE TIME WITH  PUTIN IS JUST WHAT OBAMA NEEDS  TO FEEL LOVED AGAIN. RESPECTED. CHERISHED. APPRECIATED.
THIS PICTURE TAKEN JUST AFTER  THOSE TALKS BROKE UP SUGGESTED  OTHER ADJECTIVES: AWKWARD, TENSE, COLD, INDIFFERENT.
John: INCOMMODIOUS, MALL  ADROIT, STUCK IN A LOVELESS  MARRIAGE. HEMORRHOIDAL. LIKE THEY JUST FOUND OUT WHO WAS  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT GLORY  HOLE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE, LIGHTEN  THE MOOD. SPRINKLE A LITTLE MAGIC CLINTON  GIGGLE DUST IN THERE.
WE COMPARED NOTES ON  PRESIDENT PUTIN'S EXPERTISE IN  JUDO AND MY DECLINING SKILLS IN  BASKETBALL. WE BOTH AGREED THAT AS YOU GET  OLDER IT TAKES MORE TIME TO  RECOVER. (LAUGHTER)
John: AMERICAN PRESIDENT  MAKES HUMOR TO BREAK TENSION BUT  I STATE UNDERLYING SUBTEXT TO DEFLATE HIM. WOW! NOW, LOOK, A CERTAIN FROSTINESS  BETWEEN THEM MAKES SENSE. I UNDERSTAND THESE TWO HAVE  DIFFERING OPINIONS ON WHAT TO DO  WITH THE SITUATION IN SYRIA, BUT EVEN THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE  CHILL IN THAT ROOM. THERE IS SOMETHING WEIRD GOING  ON IN THERE. WHAT COULD IT BE?
DID RUSSIAN PRESIDENT  VLADIMIR PUTIN STEAL A SUPERBOWL  BOWL RING FROM NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS OWNER ROBERT KRAFT? (AUDIENCE REACTS).
John: NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THAT BECAUSE  THAT'S THE STUPIDEST THING I  HAVE THAT EVER HEARD. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN, IT WOULD BE AMAZING IF  THAT HYPOTHETICALLY HAPPENED, IF  THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT STOLE A SUPER BOWL RING FROM THE NEW  ENGLAND PATRIOTS. BUT HOW WOULD THAT EVEN HAPPEN?
AT A HIGH-PROFILE BUSINESS  CONFERENCE EIGHT YEARS AGO IN  RUSSIA, KRAFT DID HAND THE RING OVER AND PUTIN NEVER HANDED IT  BACK.
John: OH, OH, LET'S BE  FAIR. LET'S BE FAIR. HOW CAN YOU BE ABSOLUTELY SURE  THAT IT WAS VLADIMIR PUTIN.
"I TOOK OUT THE RING AND  SHOWED IT TO PUTIN AND HE PUT IT  ON AND GOES I CAN KILL SOMEONE WITH THIS RING."  (AUDIENCE REACTS).
John: YEAH, THAT WAS HIM. OKAY, IT WAS DEFINITELY HIM. THAT STORY EMPHATICALLY CHECKS  OUT. (LAUGHTER)  SO LET'S RECAP THIS AMAZING  INCIDENT. PUTIN SAYS HE LIKES THE RING,  SAYS HE CAN KILL SOMEONE WITH IT  THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
HE PUT IN THE HIS POCKET AND  THREE K.G.B. GUYS GOT AROUND HIM  AND WALKED OUT. (LAUGHTER).
John: WHAT? IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME! SORRY, DID I SAY "PERFECT"? I MEANT BALLSIEST. PUTIN IS NOT ONLY A NUCLEAR  ARMED TYRANT HE'S ALSO THE  WORLD'S LAZIEST JEWEL THIEF. THERE'S ONE OTHER THING ABOUT  THAT PHOTO. IF YOU'VE SEEN VIDEO OF VLADIMIR  PUTIN YOU KNOW THAT HE'S NOT THE  MAN GIVEN TO EXTRAVAGANT  EMOTION. I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM. IN THIS CASE HE'S HANG GLIDING  AND HIS EXPRESSION SAYS "BEING  AN EAGLE BORES ME." (LAUGHTER)  NOW LOOK AT HIM STEALING THE  RING. LOOK AT HIS FACE! LOOK AT HIS FACE! (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS LITERALLY THE HAPPIEST  EVER I HAVE SEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN! THAT RING MADE HIM SO HAPPY! OH, MY GOD! YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO RECAPTURE  THE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM THAT  HE'S LOST AND HARNESS THE POWER OF THE OFFICE NECESSARY TO FACE  DOWN AMERICA'S GREATEST  CHALLENGES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THERE IS ONE THING HE MUST  DO. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU MUST SEEK THE  RINK! (LAUGHTER)  YOU MUST FIND THE PRECIOUS. (LAUGHTER)  ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL! ONE RING! AND MR. PRESIDENT, LOOK AT ME! WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT LET JOE  BIDEN PUT THAT RING ON HIS  FINGER! (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
