[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM, THE ROLLOUT OF THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE HAS NOT BEEN AN EASY ONE APPARENTLY NOW WITH THE WEB SITE PUNCHING PEOPLE IN THE DICK. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S WHY YOU CAN HARDLY TURN ON A TV THESE DAYS WITHOUT SEEING A MEDICAL EXPERT PROVIDING GUIDANCE.
NOW FOR PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE MARKETPLACE WHO ALREADY HAVE INSURANCE THEY SHOULD CHECK AHEAD OF TIME TO FIND OUT BECAUSE IT COULD INFLUENCE WHAT THEY ARE PAYING IN COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES.
AS OF JANUARY 1, COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE. THIS IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE.
Jon: WAIT WHAT? WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE? THAT SEEMED LESS LIKE MEDICAL THAT SADVICE AND MORE LIKECAL THANKSGIVING WITH YOUR CRAZY REPUBLICAN UNCLE. THIS IS SOCIALISM. THAT'S DR. MANNY ALVAREZ, A VALUED MEMBER OF FOX'S MEDICAL A-TEAM. THERE'S NO MR. T THERE. I SEE ALL GEORGE PAPARRD'S NO MR. T. PAPARD REFERENCE WHAT IS UP? ALVAREZ IS THERE BECAUSE HE HAS THE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE THE A-TEAM.
HEMORRHOIDS, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, MAN BOOBS, WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM, MAN BOOBS OR MOOBS.
Jon: MAN BOOBS OR -- I CALL THEM BROASTS, BOYBIES, CHESTNUTS, MAN-OR IES. BROKEBACK MOUNTAINS. [ LAUGHTER ] REALLY? THAT'S WHAT PUSHED YOU OVER THE EDGE? I GUESS MEDICAL ADVICE ISN'T REALLY THE FOCUS OF FOX'S MEDICAL EXPERTS. THEY SERVE A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT PURPOSE TO AGREE WITH FOX NEWS TALKING POINTS. SAY THE PRESIDENT WANTS EVERYONE TO HAVE INSURANCE, WHO BETTER TO SAY THAT'S A BAD IDEA THAN A DOCTOR?
BEFORE THEY STARTED THIS WE WERE ALL IN TROUBLE WITH INSURANCE TO BEGIN WITH. THERE'S TOO MUCH HEALTH INSURANCE, IT COVERS TOO MUCH, TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS, I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE. HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH HEALTH CARE, TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE AND FOOD AND SHELTER. I JUST DOESN'T FEEL SPECIAL IF EVERYONE HAS IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THESE DOCTORS DON'T JUST TAKE ON OBAMACARE, THEY ARE MEDICAL EXPERTISE CARRIES OVER TO ANY FOX TALKING POINT.
RIGHT NEW WE FEEL LIKE IT'S UNAMERICAN TO BE A PATRIOTIC AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY.
EVERYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY AT EVERY LEVEL IS ABOUT REGULATION. IT'S VERY SUSPICIOUS THAT A PRESIDENT IS NOT COMING FORWARD WITH HIS COLLEGE RECORDS.
MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. NO GROUP BE THEY GAYS, BE THEY NAMBLA, BE THEY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN BESTIALITY, THEY DON'T GET TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION.
Jon: NO GROUP, BE THEY FOX NEWS DOCTORS OR SERIAL RAPISTS. I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE EQUIVALENT, I JUST PUT THE TWO OF THEM IN A SENTENCE TOGETHER. IT'S NEUROSURGEON BEN CARSON AND HE WASN'T A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR WHEN HE SAID THAT. IT WAS AFTER THEY HEARD IT THEY ITSAID HIRE THAT GUY. YOU KNOWY VLADIMIR LENIN
ONE OF FOUNDERS OF COMMUNISM HE SAID SOCIALIZED MEDICINE IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH TO THE SOCIALIST STATE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU HAVE TO GET THE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE AS THE FOUNDATION BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU CONTROL OF THE PEOPLE.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO NIT PICK THE DOCTOR HERE BUT HISTORICALLY VLADIMIR LENIN NEVER ACTUALLY SAID THAT. IT'S A MADE UP QUOTE AND ARCHITECTURALLY, THE KEYSTONE AND THE FOUNDATION ARE DIFFERENT THINGS. ONE IS AT THE TOP AND ONE IS AT THE BOTTOM. MY POINT IS THESE GUYS SEEM LESS LIKE EXPERT DOCTORS AND MORE LIKE THE SHADY EXPERT WITNESSES PAID BY THE DEFENSE TO SAY THAT THE BULLET WOUND IS MAYBE A THIRD NIPPLE, I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT A DOCTOR, BUT'T THESE DOCTORS SEEM CRAZY. WHAT FOX REALLY NEEDS IS AN IN-HOUSE PSYCHIATRIST.
JOINING US NOW IS FOX NEWS IN-HOUSE PSYCHIATRIST DR. KEITH ABLOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK OUT WELL. DR. KEITH ABLOW DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WITH A SEGMENT PRCALLED NORMAL OR NUTS, I CAN ONLY HOPE HE IS THE VOICE OF SANITY AND REASON.
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO TURN TRANSGENDER FROM WATCHING CHAZ BONO? YES. THE DEFENSE RESTS.
