FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT DIRECTOR MR. TIM BURTON IS GOING TO BE JOINING US FOR HIS FILM, "BIG EYES".  WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT FIRST, THIS WEEKEND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY CAME TOGETHER TO STATE UNEQUIVOCALLY EVEN THE MOST DEPRAVED VIOLENCE IS JUSTIFIED IN THE FACE OF FEAR. WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S NOT THEM. THAT'S -- NO, THOSE ARE PROTESTS AGAINST FEAR-BASED VIOLENCE. I, WHERE'S MY, WHERE'S MY EXCUSING FEAR-BASED VIOLENCE? -- THERE WE GO! YES, THE DIRECTORS OF THE C.I.A. CURRENT AND FORMER APPROACHED THE BENCH AND ARGUED THE PRO CASE REBUTTING THE SENATE BLACK SITE TORTURE PRISON REPORT. FIRST UP, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR MICHAEL HAYDEN.
THREE OUT OF THE LAST FOUR ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE DEFINED THIS AS NOT BEING TORTURE. SO LET'S GET THE LEGAL DEFINITION OFF THE TABLE.
Jon: THREE OUT OF FOUR! OUR INTERROGATION PRACTICES DON'T EVEN MAKE IT TO SUGARLESS GUM APPROVAL PERCENTAGES!  (LAUGHTER) I DID THE MATH ON THE FRACTIONS THERE. BY THE WAY, COINCIDENTALLY, THE THREE OUT OF THE FOUR ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALL, I'M SURE IT'S A COINCIDENCE HAPPENED TO BE PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH'S ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO IF YOU WANTED AN EVEN STRONGER STATISTIC, YOU COULD SAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL TOLD TO SAY WHATEVER WE DID WASN'T TORTURE SAID THAT. MATH! CURRENT C.I.A. DIRECTOR BRENNAN.
I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN C.I.A. OFFICERS EXCEEDED THE POLICY GUIDANCE THAT WAS GIVEN, BUT WE ARE NOT A PERFECT INSTITUTION.
Jon: DO NOT JUDGE LEST YE BE JUDGED. FOR LET HE WHO HAS NEVER SHOVED A TUBE OF PUREED HUMMUS UP A MAN'S ARSE CAST THE FIRST STONE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE GUYS? IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE INTRODUCING EVEN THE SMALLEST HINT OF NUANCE TO THE CONVERSATION. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THOSE TWO GIVING AID AND COMFORT TO THE ENEMY. PERHAPS IT'S TIME FOR AN AMERICAN TO DEFEND THE PROGRAM. ONE OF OUR NATION'S FOUNDING FATHERS. ARE Y'ALL READY FOR THIS? AND NOW! STEPPING INTO THE RING! A 5'8", TWO-TIME VICE PRESIDENT, MULTIPLE TIME DRAFT DEFEREE, HAILING FROM AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, A MAN SO MEAN, HIS OWN HEART RAN AWAY, THE DARK CURTAIN FROM HALLIBURTON, THE IRAQ BLASTER FROM CASPER, THE PRESIDENTIAL PUPPET MASTER, MORE MACHINE THAN MAN! DICK "THE DICK" CHENEY! PRESS THE MEAT! WM-DEFEND THIS PROGRAM
NOW, YOU SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK TORTURE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY CAREFULLY AVOIDED. IT IMPLIES THAT YOU HAVE A DEFINITION OF WHAT TORTURE IS. WHAT IS IT?
WELL, TORTURE TO ME, CHUCK, IS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN ON A CELL PHONE MAKING THE LAST CALL TO HIS FOUR YOUNG DAUGHTERS SHORTLY BEFORE HE BURNS TO DEATH IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY ON 9/11. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND THAT IS WHY HE IS THE BEST WORST. DICK CHENEY SETTING THIS NATION'S MORAL BAR AT ANYTHING INCREMENTALLY BETTER THAN THE MOST DESPICABLE THING THAT HAS EVER BEEN DONE TO US. AND BY THE WAY, THAT WAS OUT OF THE GATE. THE WAS THE FIRST QUESTION HE WAS ASKED.  HE HAD JUST MET THE PRESS AND HE OPENED WITH 9/11. THAT'S LIKE LYNYRD SKYNYRD WALKING OUT AND GOING HEY, WHY DON'T WE JUST KICK IT OFF WITH A LITTLE "FREE BIRD." HOW ABOUT THAT? SEE IF THAT CAN SAVE YOU A LITTLE LIGHTER FLUID AND YOUR SHOUTING VOICES THERE. OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT IS YOU DON'T REALLY GIVE YOURSELF ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.
YOU WON'T CALL IT TORTURE?
I COME BACK TO THE PROPOSITION TORTURE WAS WHAT AL QAEDA TERRORISTS DID TO 3,000 AMERICANS ON 9/11. IN MY MIND I'VE TOLD YOU WHAT MEETS THE DEFINITION OF TORTURE. IT'S THE WHAT 19 GUYS ARMED WITH AIRLINE TICKETS AND BOX CUTTERS DID TO 3,000 AMERICANS ON 9/11.
NO, I SEE. THAT'S JUST WHAT MEETS THE DEFINITION OF TORTURE IN HIS MIND. HIS MIND, I ASSUME BEING THE SCARIEST (BLEEP) PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE. YOU KNOW WHAT?  I'M SORRY. I KNOW THIS IS GONNA HAUNT MY NIGHTMARES. I DON'T CARE. I'VE GOTTA KNOW. CHUCK, CAN WE ZOOM INSIDE DICK CHENEY'S MIND?
DOES THAT MEET THE DEFINITION OF TORTURE IN YOUR MIND?
IN MY MIND -- ♪ SUCH A PRETTY SIGHT TO SEE   ♪  WHAT A JOY IT IS TO BE   ♪  HERE IN UNICORNIA   (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HMM, NEVER -- NEVER TOOK HIM FOR A BRONY. EVERY TIME I THINK THIS MAN CAN'T GET MORE FASCINATING. SO, I GUESS WE CAN TEST. IS DICK CHENEY A RIGHTEOUS WARRIOR OR A PSYCHOPATH? IT'S ONE THING TO FEEL REMORSELESS VENGEANCE AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED US. WHICH IS WHY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION THAT'S FOLLOWED THE VIGILANTE'S CODE -- I'M SORRY, RULE OF LAW. RULE OF LAW. BUT WHAT IF HYPOTHETICALLY, THIS TREATMENT WAS PERPETRATED ON SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN DETAINED WRONGLY, SURELY THAT WOULD SOFTEN CHENEY'S BRONSON-LIKE TORTURE BONER.
LET ME GO TO GUL RAHMAN. HE WAS CHAINED TO THE WALL OF HIS CELL, DOUSED WITH WATER, FROZE TO DEATH IN C.I.A. CUSTODY. AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
Jon: DICK?
RIGHT. BUT THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITH ALL THE FOLKS THAT WE DID RELEASE THAT ENDED UP BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD. I'M MORE CONCERNED WITH BAD GUYS WHO GOT OUT AND RELEASED THAN I AM WITH A FEW THAT, IN FACT, WERE INNOCENT.
Jon: IT'S LIKE THIS GUY'S THE VICE PRESIDENT IN A CORMAC McCARTHY NOVEL. CALL IT, CALL IT, FRIENDO! WAA -- CALL IT, FRIENDO -- WAA -- HEADS -- WAAA. BUT LOOK, PERHAPS WE'RE BEING UNFAIR, I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT DICK CHENEY IS USING THE TERRIBLE SPECTER OF WHAT HAPPENED ON 9/11 ROBOTICALLY, AS A CUDGEL TO BEAT DOWN ARGUMENT, DRAINING ALL EMOTION AND MEANING OUT OF THAT TERRIBLE DAY AS HE USES IT IN SERVICE OF AVOIDING CULPABILITY. YEAH, I'M NOT DOING THAT. CHENEY DOES FEEL UPSET. CHENEY DOES FEEL HURT, ANGRY EVEN AT HAVING TO ANSWER THINGS.
WHEN YOU SAY WATERBOARDING IS NOT TORTURE THEN WHY DID WE PROSECUTE JAPANESE SOLDIERS IN WORLD WAR II?
FOR, FOR A LOT OF STUFF. NOT FOR WATERBOARDING. THEY DID AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHER STUFF. IT'S A REALLY CHEAP SHOT, CHUCK, TO EVEN TRY TO DRAW A PARALLEL.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S TOO FAR CHARLES DAVID CHUCK TODD! THAT WAS A LOADED QUESTION.  YOU CAN'T JUST POP UP OUT OF NOWHERE AND SHOOT AN OLD MAN IN THE FACE WITH A QUESTION LIKE THAT! HOW DARE YOU, CHUCK TODD! AT LONG LAST, WHY WOULD YOU ASK ABOUT DECENCY? SO WITH THE MORAL CONTROVERSY PUT TO BED, LET'S FOCUS ON EFFICACY. THE MUCH RESEARCHED SENATE C.I.A. REPORT SUGGESTED THE INFORMATION COULD HAVE AND IN MANY CASES WAS OBTAINED BY DIFFERENT MORE GENEVA CONVENTION-Y, LESS BUTT FEED-Y METHODS.
IT WORKED. IT WORKED NOW FOR 13 YEARS. IT ABSOLUTELY DID WORK. I'D DO IT AGAIN IN A MINUTE.
Jon: WOULDN'T GIVE IT A THOUGHT. WAA. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT DICK CHENEY. HE'S IMPERVIOUS TO DOUBT. NEVER ENTERS HIS MIND. PROBABLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE LITTLE PONIES RUNNING AROUND UP THERE, BUT NEVER ENTERS HIS MIND THAT THE CONFIDENT, PLAIN-SPOKEN PRONOUNCEMENTS OF TRUTH ARE OFTENTIMES COMPLETE (BLEEP). JUST FROM HIS APPEARANCES ON "MEET THE PRESS."
THAT REPORT HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL CONFIRMED THAT HE DID GO TO PRAGUE AND HE DID MEET WITH THE SENIOR OFFICIAL OF THE IRAQI INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. AND SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS A LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH VARIOUS TERRORIST GROUPS INCLUDING THE AL QAEDA ORGANIZATION. WE BELIEVE HE HAS IN FACT RECONSTITUTED NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE HAS BEEN SEEKING TO ACQUIRE THE KIND OF TUBES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO BUILD A CENTRIFUGE. THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT I THINK WOULD BE ONE OF THE LEADING, PERHAPS THE LEADING STATE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD. MY BELIEF IS WE WILL IN FACT BE GREETED AS LIBERATORS.
Jon: GUESS WHAT, THEY LOVED IT SO MUCH THEY WOULDN'T LET US LEAVE FOR OVER A DECADE. YOU KNOW WHAT,  JUST BECAUSE HE'S SO BITTER AND ANGRY DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO BE. I'M GOING TO END ON A NOTE OF GRATITUDE, WITH SOMETHING THAT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SAY: GEORGE W. BUSH, THANK YOU FOR NOT DYING WHILE YOU WERE IN OFFICE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
