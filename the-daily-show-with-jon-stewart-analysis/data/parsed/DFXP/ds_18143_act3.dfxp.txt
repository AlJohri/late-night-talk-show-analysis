WE'RE BACK. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS A LEGENDARY  TALK SHOW HOST, HOSTING THE SHOW  FROM THE BRAND NEW FOX SPORTS 1  NETWORK. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  THE MAGNIFICENT REGIS PHILBIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU. John: MR. FILL BIN, SIR,  MANY, MANY THANKS FOR BEING  HERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. John: YOU'RE WITH FOX SPORTS  1 NOW.
YES, HOW ABOUT THAT? John: IS FOX GOING TO DO TO  SPORTS WHAT THEY DID TO NEWS? THEY'RE GOING TO BLAME  EVERYTHING ON THE WHITE HOUSE?
THE EAGLES LOST TODAY BECAUSE  OF OF OBAMA CARE.
THAT'S FUNNY STUFF. I'M AMAZED.
John: THAT'S NICE OF YOU TO  SAY THAT TO ME.
I WISH I COULD HAVE. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS GOING  INTO IT. I THINK ALL THE NETWORKS WILL  HAVE A SPORTS CHANNEL BEFORE  LONG. AND SO FOX SPORTS STARTS THIS  COMING MONDAY.
John: SPORTS IS THE PERFECT  EMOTIONAL...
THE ONLY THING THAT GETS  RATINGS ON THE SHOW. ON THE TV.
John: BECAUSE WE LOVE IT. SPORTS TAKES ALL YOUR CARES  AWAY. NEWS IS AWFUL. SO YOU THINK LET'S WATCH THE  SPORTS. THAT IS ABOUT A GLORIOUS KIND OF  NOTHING.
DO YOU HAVE SUCH A SPORT  THING IN LONDON, IN ENGLAND?
John: I THINK WE INVENTED  SPORTS. DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT THE GREEKS  SAID. THAT WAS NAKED WRESTLING. THAT WAS DIFFERENT. WE HAVE FOOTBALL (ONE AUDIENCE  MEMBER YELLS OUT).
YOU HAVE SOCCER. YOU HAVE CRICKET.
John: WE DO HAVE CRICKET. ARE YOU PROUD OF THAT? WHAT IS CRICKET ALL ABOUT?
John: CRICKET IS WHAT ABOUT  WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO ENJOY AS A  HUMAN BEING. AS A PARTICIPANT AND A  SPECTATOR. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY CRICKET?
WE JUST COVERD CRICKET ON THE  SHOW.
John: YOU DID? WE HAVE A BRITISH GUY WHO  RUNS THE WHOLE THING MICHAEL  DAVEY.
John: I KNOW MICHAEL DAVEY. I HAVE A PRETTY BLONDE FROM  LONDON RIGHT NEXT TO ME.
John: YEAH. YOU KNOW HER TOO. John: I LOVE THE WAY YOU SAY  THAT BECAUSE THAT IS LIKE HOW TV  SHOWS USED TO BE PITCHED. "I GET A PRETTY BLONDE FROM  LONDON. PUT HER NEXT TO REGIS. YOU'VE GOT A SHOW."  I DON'T THINK EVEN MICHAEL DAVIS  AND THE PRETTY BLONDE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL CRICKET TO  AMERICA.
YOU NEVER HEARD OF GORGEY  THOMPSON.
John: I DO. SHE KNOWS YOU AND I'VE BEEN  ASKING HER ABOUT YOU.
John: WHOA! AFTER THE SHOW WE'LL TALK. John: SHE'S FANTASTIC. SHE WAS ON THE NEWS FOR YEARS.
TEN YEARS. John: GOOD LUCK SELLING  CRICKET.
DO YOU PLAY CRICKET. John: YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYTHING IN BRITAIN IS CLASS  BASED. SO CRICKET IS FOR POSH PEOPLE.
REALLY? John: THAT'S NOT FOR THE  LIKES OF ME. I KNOW I SOUND LIKE IT.
WHAT SPORT DID YOU PLAY AS A  KID GROWING UP.
John: SOCCER. RELIGIOUSLY.
IT'S A BIG DEAL. IT'S GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER  IN AMERICA.
John: I WANT TO BE A SOCCER  PLAYER MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THIS WAS VERY MUCH PLAN-B.
HOW IN THE WORLD DID THIS  HAPPEN? YOU WANTED TO PLAY SOCCER AND  HERE YOU ARE.
John: IT WAS A COMPLETE LACK  OF PHYSICAL ABILITY. AND THAT'S ALL.
YOU COULDN'T KICK THE BALL. John: ARE YOU A FRUSTRATED  ATHLETE AS WELL?
I USED TO PLAY IN BRONX PARK. John: PLAY WHAT? BASEBALL. John: CLASSIC. A LITTLE FOOTBALL. YEAH, SURE.
John: YOU'RE A YANKEE FAN. YES, I AM. (A FEW PEOPLE IN THE CROWD  CHEERING).
YOU'VE BEEN HERE SEVEN YEARS. ARE YOU A BASEBALL FAN.
John: I AM. I IMMEDIATELY PICKED THE METS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. BECAUSE YOU ARE ENTITLED TO BE A  YANKEE FAN. YOU ARE BORN IN THE BRONX. YOU CAN'T CHOOSE TO BE A YANKEE  FAN. THAT'S NOT HOW SPORT WORKS.
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO BE A  METS FAN.
John: I ASSOCIATE SPORT WITH  MISERY. I UNDERSTAND THE METS.
HE'S FUNNY. ISN'T HE FUNNY?
John: THAT'S OFFICIAL. I LIKE HIM. John: THIS WHOLE SUMMER HAS  BEEN LEADING TO YOUR APPROVAL,  REGIS. THAT'S ALL I WANTED.
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO  STAY? IF STEWART STAYS AWAY MUCH  LONGER HE'S OUT OF A JOB.
John: I THINK THAT'S NOT THE  CASE. CONTRACTUALLY AND PHYSICALLY, I  HAVE ONE MORE DAY.
ARE YOU FIDDING ME. John: AS A TV LEGEND, DO YOU  HAVE ANY TIPS FOR MY FINAL SHOW  TOMORROW.
I WISH I WAS ON IT. John: WOULD YOU HAVE DRESSED  UP LIKE BETTE AND SANG? A CROWD GOES WILD. IT PREMIERES ON MONDAY AUGUST 19  AT 5:00 P.M. AND IT WILL ALSO  AIR WEEKDAYS. THE WONDERFUL REGIS PHILBIN,
