MAY 18, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A NIGHT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT A NIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS -- MY GUEST TONIGHT HIS STORY CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR RICHARD BEEMAN, HALF  BEE, HALF MAN ALL HISTORIAN. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. LET ME TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT WITHIN THE REALM OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS. YOU MAY REMEMBER A WEEK AGO FORM ER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND LEAGUEO FIGURINE MODEL NEWT  GINGRICH DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY. YOU MIGHT THINK THE PARTY OF FAMILY VALUES MAY HAVE PROBLEMS. THE TWICE DIVORCED SANCTIONED ON ETHICS CHARGES FORMER SPEAK OF THE HOUSE. WOULD YOU BE WRONG.
NEWT GINGRICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN IDEAS MONEY AND WILL PROVIDE  A LOT OF POSITIVE INPUT IN THE DEBATE.
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT.
REMEMBER NEWT GINGRICH IS A TOWERING CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUAL.
HE IS A SCHOLAR. HE UNDERSTANDS WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM.
HE IS ONE OF SMARTEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA. HE COMES UP WITH TWO IDEAS EVERY MINUTE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HERE IS MY IMPRESSION OF NEWT GINGRICH IN A MINUTE. [LAUGHTER] NONALCOHOLIC TEQUILA. [LAUGHTER] BOMB SNIFFING TURTLES. [LAUGHTER] KOSHER BACON. [LAUGHTER] EDIBLE DIAPERS. [LAUGHTER] TWO IDEAS A MINUTE BUT A LOT OF THEM. THE LARGER POINT IS ALL IS FORGIVEN. YOU GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION. HE CHOSE JUST THE PLACE TO DO IT "MEET THE PRESS." A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF. DAVID GREGORY SET HIM UP WITH AN EASY ONE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PAUL RYAN'S MEDICARE.
SHOULD THE REPUBLICANS CHANGE MEDICARE? YONCH THINK RIGHT WING SOCIAL ENGINEERING IS ANY MORE DESIRABLE THAN LEFT WING SOCIAL ENGINEERING. I DON'T THINK IMPOSING RADICAL CHANGE FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT IS A VERY GOOD WAY FOR THE  SOCIETY TO OPERATE.
Jon: WOW APPEALING TO THE MODERATE WING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, A WING CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS. [LAUGHTER] I'M SURE THEY RESPECT THE GRAVITAS.
HE DETONATED HIS CAMPAIGN ON SUNDAY.
DOES HE WANT TO BE NOMINATED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. ONE WONDERS.
HE WAS NEVER A LIKABLE GUY.
THIS IS A CAPITAL OFFENSE.
HOW CAN I SAY THIS POLITELY? HE WAS URINATING INSIDE THE FAMILY CIRCLE. [LAUGHTER] >>
Jon: WHAT WOULD THE IMPOLITE WAY HAVE BEEN TO SAY THAT? [LAUGHTER] HOW DO I PUT THIS IMPOLITELY HE (bleep) THE GHOST OF RONALD REAGAN AND THEN WIPED HIS  (bleep) ON TEDDY ROOSEVELT'S BEDSPREAD. NO DISRESPECT. [LAUGHTER] LEADERSHIP, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS AND STAND BY THEM.
EARLIER IN THE DAY SPEAKING ON A CONFERENCE CALL GINGRICH TRIED TO PASS THE BLAME TO THE  ADVERSARIAL NATURE OF MEET THE PRESS SAYING QUOTE -- "I DIDN'T  GO IN THERE QUITE HOSTILE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME THAT GOING IN WOULD YOU SPR A  SERIES OF SETUPS."
OH, MAN.
THIS WASN'T ME RANDOMLY SAYING THINGS. THESE WERE DELIBERATE EFFORTS TO PICK FIGHTS."
Jon: I GET YOU. YOU GOT ON THE POLITICAL SNOWS YOU -- SHOWS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. IT'S SCARY. INTIMIDATING.
WELCOME BACK. THIS IS YOUR 35th APPEARANCE ON THE PROGRAM. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU'VE BEEN ON THAT SHOW MORE TIMES THAN DAVID GREGORY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S NOT GOING TO FLY, NEWT. YOU KNOW THAT. THAT'S A TERRIBLE EXCUSE. TRY AGAIN.
WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE I'M GOING TO ON OH, I WANT TO SHAND -- ON OBJECTION I WANT  TO -- AND I'M GOING TO ON OCCASION I WANT TO SAY IT WAS A MISTAKE. I WANT TO SAY ON THE RECORD ANY IDEA THAT QUOTES WHAT I SAID ON SUNDAY IS SAY FALSEHOOD. I HAVE SAID PUBLICLY THOSE WORDS WERE INACCURATE AND UNFORTUNATE.
Jon: I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE HALLMARK OF ON HONEST CONVERSATION WORKS WELL WHEN  SAYING IF YOU DON'T ME DIRECTLY USING VIDEO TAPE OF MY CONVERSATION YOU'RE LYING.
YOUR AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR PARTY.
SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT BEFORE YOU MAKE A BIGGER FOOL OF YOURSELF. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THIS WAS HIS TUESDAY BOOK SIGNINGS IN MINNEAPOLIS.
STOP THE HATE. STOP ANTIGAY POLITICS. IT'S DIVIDING OUR COUNTRY.
Jon: AS HOTEL TURNDOWN SERVICE CONSISTED OF A CHOCOLATE MINT AND A PUNCH IN THE NUTS. IT WAS NOT A GOOD DAY. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SAMANTHA BEE. SAM, REPUBLICANS ARE OUTRAGED AT HIM. DEMOCRATS ARE SPRINKLING HIM WITH GLITTER. [LAUGHTER] HOW BAD IS THIS FOR NEWT GINGRICH?
WELL, JON, IT'S BAD. IT IS REAL BAD. ON THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE VIABILITY SCALE IT'S NOT JUST  JOHN KERRY'S I LOOK LIKE A SPERM MOMENT, IT'S A FULL-ON HOWARD DEAN.
WHOOOAHHH!
PACK IT IN, NEWT. IT WAS A GOOD RUN. >>.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK HE CAN COME BACK FROM THIS?
NO NEW YORK CITY, HE CRITICIZED A FELLOW REPUBLICAN. IF HE WANTS TO UNDO THAT KIND OF DAMAGE HE NEEDS A SISTER SOULJA MOMENT.
Jon: ISN'T THAT WHEN A DEMOCRAT DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM HIS BASE.
EVERY DEMOCRAT HAS TO HAVE ONE LIKE WHEN OBAMA EXTENDED THE BUSH CATS.
IS THIS HIS SISTER SOULJA MOMENT. WHEN BILL CLINTON TOOK ON THAT RAP SINGER IN 1992 HE WAS TRYING TO SAY I'M A DIFFERENT TYPE OF  DEMOCRAT, I'M NOT GOING TO COW TOW TO THIS?
THAT'S WHAT NEWT GINGRICH NEEDS TO GO THAT NOW.
Jon: THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH THE RYAN STATEMENT CRITICIZING THE EXTREMISM OF IT.
FOR DEMOCRATS IT'S ABOUT DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM THE LEFT. FOR THE REPUBLICANS IT'S ABOUT DISTANCING THEM SELF-FROM THE LEFT. AS FAR AS PUNDITS ARE CONCERNED NO MATTER WHAT NOMINATION YOU ARE SEEKING, IT'S IMPORTANT TO  DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM THE LEFT.
Jon: RYAN'S MEDICARE PLAN IS UNPOPULAR. PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE IT. IN THIS CASE THE CENTER IS AGAINST IT.
RIGHT, I GUESS I SEE WHERE YOU ARE GOING WITH THIS. IT'S AN INTERESTING POINT. ♪ ♪  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SAM, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
I JUST KIND OF THOUGHT THAT ONE OF US WOULD DISAPPEAR. [LAUGHTER] SHOULD I JUST GO.
Jon: YOU SHOULD JUST GO. THANK
