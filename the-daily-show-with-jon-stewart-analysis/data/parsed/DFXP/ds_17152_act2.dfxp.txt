WELCOME BACK. NOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MITT  ROMNEY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE  LATINO COMMUNITY WAS ALREADY  SOMEWHAT STRAINED. THEN CAME THE RELEASE OF THESE  TAPES WITH HIM SAYING THINGS  LIKE THIS.
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF I WERE  LATINO.
Jon: YES, VERY HELPFUL. THAT'S TAKEN ROMNEY'S  RELATIONSHIP FROM NO BUENO TO  BUENO B  *UBGSENO AND HE KNOWS  THAT IS DANGEROUS.
IF THE HISPANIC BLOCK BECOME  A COMMITTED TO TO THE DEMOCRATS  AS THE AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE WE'RE IN TROUBLE AS A PARTY AND  I THINK AS A NATION. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: AND THIS IS A GUY  WHOSE RELIGION FORBIDS HIM FROM  DRINKING ALCOHOL. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT HE WOULD  SAY IF HE WAS (BLEEP) FACED? (LAUGHTER)  HEY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING  ELSE, DON'T GET ME STARTED ON  THE ASIANS, I'LL TELLING YOU! TRICKY, TRICKY PEOPLE. FOR MORE ON THE STORY, WE'RE  JOINED BY AL MADRIGAL AND  JESSICA WILLIAMS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (APPLAUSE)  AL MADRIGAL, JESSICA, DO YOU  TAKE THESE COMMENTS AS A LATINO,  AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, AS OFFENSIVE IN ANY WAY.
WAIT, YOU MEAN ROMNEY IS NOT  A LATINO? ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
Jon: YEAH.
HE'S GOT GREAT HAIR, FIVE  KIDS, HIS WIFE DRIVES TWO  CADILLACS. IT SOUND PRETTY LATINO TO ME. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: HE'S NOT. BUT HE'S SAYING THAT IF HE WAS  LATINO IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR  HIM TO BECOME PRESIDENT.
NOT JUST PRESIDENT, JON,  EVERYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY IS  EASIER IF YOU'RE LATINO. (LAUGHTER)  YOU THINK I COULD HAVE GOTTEN  INTO COLLEGE IF I WASN'T LATINO? NO WAY! AFFIRMATIVE ACTION! IT'S JUST LIKE SHAKESPEARE SAID  "OF ALL THE RACES 'TWIXT EARTH  AND SKY, LATINOS ARE THE  LUCKIEST."  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: UM, WHICH PLAY WAS  THAT FROM?
THE ONE WITH THE LATINOS IN  IT. (LAUGHTER)  "ROMEO AND JULIET."  (APPLAUSE)  LIKE I SAID, I ONLY GOT INTO  COLLEGE BECAUSE I'M LATINO.
HEY, WELL, THAT'S NOTHING,  ALL RIGHT? I'M BLACK AND A WOMAN. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO APPLY TO  COLLEGE. WE JUST SEND IN A HEAD SHOT AND  THEY SEND US A DIPLOMA. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH REMINDS ME, I NEED TO MAIL  THIS. MED SCHOOL GRADUATION, HERE I  COME! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BUT ROMNEY HAS  DEGREES. ROMNEY HAS A LAW DEGREE, AN  M.B.A.
RIGHT, BUT AS AN  UNDERPRIVILEGED RICH WHITE MALE  HE HAD TO EARN THOSE!
Jon: BUT HE HAD A LOT OF  HELP. HE JUST-- IT WASN'T FROM THE  GOVERNMENT. HIS FATHER PAID FOR HIS  EDUCATION, GAVE HIM A LOAN FOR  HIS FIRST HOUSE. IT GIVES HIM AN EDGE IN BUILDING  A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS.
JON, YOU'RE MISSING THE  POINT. HE STILL HAD TO BUILD HIS  BUSINESS. LATINOS JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR  SOMEONE ELSE TO BUILD IT THEN WE  LANDSCAPE IT AND MOVE IN. (LAUGHTER). (APPLAUSE).
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. THAT--
Jon: NOT TO MENTION THAT WE  NEVER HAVE TO LOOK FOR WORK. IT JUST COMES TO US! I CAN STAND ON A STREET CORNER  ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND  GUARANTEE YOU A PICKUP TRUCK  WILL PULL UP AND LITERALLY OFFER ME A JOB ON THE SPOT. (LAUGHTER)
HE'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THE SYSTEM'S BEEN  AGAINST ROMNEY FROM THE START. LOOK AT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSING  HE GREW UP IN. THAT'S WHAT? HUH? THREE STORIES? BLACK PEOPLE GET, LIKE, 50  STORIES OF GOVERNMENT HOUSING. (LAUGHTER)  AND YOU KNOW, WHICH EVER WAY YOU  LOOK AT IT, JOHN, BEING A  MINORITY AND/OR POOR IS A NET  POSITIVE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. AL MADDREY GAL AND JESSICA  WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY.
