WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, VERY FUNNY COMEDIAN. HIS SHOW FX'S "LOUIS." THANK GOODNESS IT'S BACK FOR ANOTHER SEASON.
IT'S A MOTHER DOG. IT'S A MOTHER DOG LIKE 14-NIPPLE BELLY. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF I GO LIKE THIS. IT'S HAPPENING NOW, YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT. IT'S A SIX PACK FOR A WHOLE OTHER REASON. IT JUST HANGS IN SECTIONS. IT ACTUALLY IS THREE SECTIONS WITH A SPLIT IN THE MIDDLE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW "LOUIS"CK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY.
Jon: GREAT TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'M SO GLAD THE SHOW IS BACK ON.
THANK YOU
Jon: YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN?
I DON'T WANT TO SHAKE. I JUST WANT US TO HOOVER.
Jon: DO THE HOVER SHAKE. FIRST EPISODE WAS SO GOOD.
THANK YOU. JON AND YOUR ACTING NOW IS GETTING GOOD.
YOU WERE DESCRIBING IT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAYING, "YOU'RE ACTING NOW," WHICH IS THE WAY IT FEELS. IT FEELS GOOFY.
Jon: YOU AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR SO MANY YEARS. AND WE ALL SUCKED. THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE US ACTEDDORS AND WE ALL SUCKED AT IT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU BECAME GOOD. WAIT. WHAT ABOUT TAKING THE REST OF US WITH YOU.
I HAVE MORE PRACTICE, THAT'S ALLMENT I'VE JUST DONE IT FOR LONGER. I STILL SUCK PRETTY BAD, THOUGH.
Jon: STOP IT. FIRST EPISODE, THE WOMAN WHO PLAYED YOUR SISTER.
ARE RUSTY SCHWIMMER.
Jon: SO GOOD.
SHE'S GREAT. JANUARY JON CAN WE SAY FIRST EPISODE WHAT...
IT'S ALL ABOUT A BIG FART. THE WHOLE FIRST EPISODE IS ABOUT A FART. AND...
Jon: HOW LONG IS THE FART?
I THINK IT WAS 42 SECONDS LONG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [LAUGHTER] ONE-TENTH OF AN EPISODE IS A FART. MORE THAN ONE-TENTH. 20% OF THE EPISODE IS A FART.
Jon: I DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH YOUR SHOW. I DON'T LET THEM WATCH MY SHOW, BUT I BROUGHT THEM IN THE ROOM FOR THE 42-SECOND FART. THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.
LISTEN, FARTS TAKE A LOT OF  [BLEEPED] FOR BEING...
Jon: WHAT?
THEY DO. PEOPLE THINK THAT THAT'S LOW-BROW HUMOR, STUPID HUMOR. TO ME A FART IS FUNNY. FART IS... LET'S BREAK DOWN A FART FOR A SECOND.
Jon: PLEASE.
OKAY. IT COMES OUT OF YOUR ASS. [LAUGHTER] OKAY. IT SMELLS...
Jon: I'M GLAD YOU WENT FOR THAT NUMBER ONE.
IT COMES OUT OF YOUR ASS. IT COMES OUT OF YOUR ASS. IT SMELLS LIKE POOP. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN JUST HANGING OUT NEXT TO IT FOR A LONG TIME. AND IT MAKES A LITTLE TRUMPET NOISE. COME ON, MAN. WHAT'S NOT FUNNY ABOUT THAT? YOUR ASS FLESH RUBS TOGETHER AND IT MAKES A NOISE THAT SMELLS LIKE POOP THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR ASS. THAT'S HILARIOUS. THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING IN THE WORLD. HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SMART TO LAUGH  AT FARTDS, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE STUPID NOT TO.
Jon: FOR THAT, I MEAN, THAT IS WHY WE INDUCT YOU INTO THE COMEDY HALL OF FAME.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: A LOT OF TIMES JOKES WHEN YOU DECONSTRUCT THEM BECOME LESS FUNNY. NOW I THINK FARTS WILL BE EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE. THANK YOU.
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON.
YOU'RE ALWAYS RAGGING ON YOURSELF. YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE WORLD? YOU'RE NOT THE FOOTAGE THEY USE ON STORIES ABOUT BAD HEALTH. YOU'RE NOT THAT FOOTAGE FROM YOU WITH THE HEAD DOWN LIKE, IF AMERICA DOESN'T GET WISE TO  THIS, WE'LL FALL BEHIND THAILAND.
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GROCER THAN I AM. THAT'S TRUE.
Jon: WE ALL ARE. I'M WEARING A SUIT UNDERNEATH THIS. I'M...
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOME LITTLE SAG SECTIONS AND A LITTLE BIT OF... BUT I'M BIG. [LAUGHTER] NO, HERE'S THE THING, I'VE BEEN...
Jon: DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A DECREPIT
OFF, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
I WORK HARD TO MAINTAIN THIS. THIS IS ME BEING PRESENTABLE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. I'M ON CAMERA AND THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL IN MY LIFE. SO I... THIS IS AS GOOD AS I CAN LOOK. THAT'S WHY I THINK PEOPLE KEEP YOU FROM BEING GROSS. WHEN I'VE DRIVEN EVERYONE AWAY AND I'M NOT ON TV ANYMORE, I'M  GOING TO BE... I'M JUST GOING TO... AND I'M EXCITED FOR IT. I'M JUST GOING TO BE THAT GUY WITH THE SECOND BELLY, THE CROTCH BELLY. YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS WITH POLYESTER PANTS, AND IT'S JUST, AND IT'S NOT EVEN LIKE A LITTLE BUMP WHERE IT'S JUST... IT'S  LIKE A PUMPKIN POP IN THERE. AND THEN LIKE WHEN I SEE IT JUST... WHEN I SEE IT JUST GLISTENS LIKE A... YOU KNOW? [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW THOSE FOUNTAINS WHERE IT JUST GETS WET ON THE MARBLE INSTEAD OF GUSHING. AND WHEN I GET HORNY I'LL JUST...
Jon: SO YOUR BUCKET LIST IS LITERALLY JUST FOODS IN A BUCKET.
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO BE AND I'M GOING THE MAKE IT. IT'S NOT HARD GOAL. HERE'S THE THING, I THINK PEOPLE, THEIR NATURAL STATE IS TO JUST EAT FRITOS AND JUST  [BLEEPED] YOUR PANTS AND DIE. OSAMA BIN LADEN, WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM, HE WAS DRINKING COCA-COLA AND GETTING HIGH AND  WATCHING PORN AND LIKE GOOGLING HIMSELF IN A BLANKET. LIKE HE WAS JUST... I THOUGHT WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM HE'D BE IN A CAVE WITH TWO GRENADES  INTENSE, BUT HE WAS JUST GOING BACK TO HIS ROOM WITH HIS SNACK, OH, BHEEP BLEEP. OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I DID THAT THING. LIKE HE JUST... HE HAD SOME NACHOS FROM... [CHEERING AND
