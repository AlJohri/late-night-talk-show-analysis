YOU KNOW, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE YOUR SHOW YET. IT WILL DOUBLE AFTER THIS.
Jon: YOU ARE THE NEW OPRAH.
I AM?
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE A LINE FOR THAT, BUT I'M GOING TO SAY IT. I AM GOING TO BE NICE TONIGHT.
YOU SHOULD TRY TO BE NICE TONIGHT, BECAUSE LIFE IS GOOD, THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS?
NO.
Jon: I MEAN THIS, THIS IS WITH NO DISRESPECT.
YOU KNOW, I AM NOT A REPUBLICAN, YOU KNOW THAT.
Jon:.
THEY ARE ALL PINHEADS, ALL OF THEM. REGISTERED INDEPENDENT.
Jon: OF COURSE YOU ARE A >>REGISTERED INDEPENDENT, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO GO ON EACH ELECTION.
ARE YOU GOING TO GO FOR THE REPUBLICAN OR MAYBE THE CONSERVATIVE -- LISTEN, THIS IS ASININE.
IT IS, I AGREE.
Jon: WHY DON'T YOU CALL THEM AND TELL THEM.
YES, I CALLED THEM.
WHO DID YOU CALL?
I CALLED BOTH PARTIES TO KNOCK IT OFF.
Jon: BOTH PARTIES AREN'T DOING IT. BUT THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING SOMETHING, THE DEMOCRATS ARE JUST ENACTING A LAW THAT THEY PASSED IN 2009.
YEAH. WELL, THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.
Jon: THEY SHOULD ENACT THE LAW THAT PASSED IN 2009. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
UNLESS THERE IS A REVISION TO THE LAW. IT CAN WORK THAT WAY.
Jon: PASS A REVISION OF THE LAW. NOBODY HAS A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
EVERYBODY HAS A PROBLEM. THE POLL SAY NOBODY LIKES THE LAW.
Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT'S HOW WE DO THINGS NOW.
THEY DIDN'T POLL YOU GUYS.
Jon: THEY DON'T POLL IN CUBA. REALLY, YOU ARE MAKING THEM SEEM LIKE EXILES IN THE AUDIENCE. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, I MEAN, LET'S GO BY A POLL, IF YOU WANT TO DO IT BY THAT, THE LAW WE SHOULD BE PASSING MORE THAN ANY OTHER LAW IS BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN OWNERS BECAUSE 90 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE --
I AGREE. I WANT TO DO IT.
Jon: NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
SURE I DO.
Jon: YOU ARE A BIG BACKGROUND CHECK GUY.
YES.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
ABSOLUTELY. REGISTER YOUR CAR AND REGISTER YOUR BAZOOKA, COME ON.
Jon: YOU ARE -- YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU ARE FROM CUBA. SO -- BUT HONESTLY, HOW DARE THEY SAY --
STOP WITH ALL OF THIS NONSENSE.
Jon: WHAT?
THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. YES. THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. GO IN AND SAY, LOOK, THE NEXT, TOMORROW, IT KICKS IN, YOU ARE GOING TO SIGN UP TOMORROW FOR OBAMACARE.
Jon: THE EXCHANGES
I GET HEALTHCARE FROM HERE.
YOU DO.
Jon: YES, I AM IN A UNION.
YOU MAY BE THROWN OUT BECAUSE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS ARE THROWING PEOPLE OFF, BUT ANYWAY, IF YOU WANT TO SIGN UP TOMORROW FOR OBAMACARE, YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO.
Jon: OKAY.
BUT LIKE THE CORPORATIONS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA GAVE A WAIVER TO, THE MANY, MANY, HE SHOULD GIVE WAIVERS TO INDIVIDUAL, IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WE'LL GIVE IT A YEAR TO SEE HOWT ALL THIS SHAKES OUT.
Jon: BUT PEOPLE CAN APPLY FOR A WAIVER.
CORRECT.
IS THAT FAIR?
Jon: DID WE SOLVE IT?  I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SOLVES IT BUT --
IT DELAYS IT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO. IT DOESN'T DELAY IT --
IT IS A MANDATORY LAW. THE LAW GOES IN AND PEOPLE CAN.
Jon: PEOPLE CAN PETITION THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO SIGN UP. WHAT DID THEY DO IN 2003 WHEN THEY DID THE MEDICARE PART D?
COME ON, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER THAT. COME ON, I DON'T REMEMBER. RIDICULOUS.
Jon: BUT IT WAS A LAW --
THIS THING IS SCREWED UP, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
Jon: WHEN DOES LEGISLATION COME THROUGH THAT IS NOT SCREWED UP A LITTLE BIT.
I THINK THE LEGISLATION TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA IN COLORADO IS WORKING GREAT, EVERYONE IS STONED.
Jon: THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO -- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THEY GOT NOTHING, THEY GOT NOTHING. THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS, THEY HAVE GOT NOTHING.
WHAT.
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT SYRIA NEXT I WANT TO HEAR YOUR SOLUTION FOR THAT.
YES, I DO.
Jon: WE WILL COME BACK. KILLING JESUS NOW, IT IS ON BOOKSHELVES, ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T JUST BOUGHT BY THE HOTELS TO STICK NEXT TO BIBLES?
