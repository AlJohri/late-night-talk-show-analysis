( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FORMER  UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE  GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. HER NEW BOOK IS PIONEERING WOMEN  WHO SHAPED TEXAS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM KAY BAILEY HUTCHINSON. HOW ARE YOU? HAVE A SEAT. WELL, WE GOT SO MUCH TO TALK  ABOUT, WE'LL START HERE WITH THE  BOOK YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN UNFLINCHING COURAGE PIONEERING  WOMEN WHO SHAPED TEXAS. YOU TALK ABOUT JANE LONG, THE  MOTHER OF TEXAS.
RIGHT. Jon: HOW DID SHE GET TO BE  THE MOTHER OF TEXAS?
BECAUSE SHE CAME IN FIRST,  BACK IN REALLY THE EARLIEST  1800s BEFORE THERE WAS ANYTHING THERE. AND BLESS HER HEART, HER HUSBAND  WAS LEAVE LEADING WHAT WAS  THOUGHT TO BE A REVOLUTION AGAINST THE MEKS SCAN  GOVERNMENT.
Jon: TURNED OUT TO BE... I  MEAN, YOU REALLY EXTRAPOLATE THE  STORY.
WELL, ANYWAY, SHE WAS LEFT ON  GALVESTON ISLAND BY HERSELF,  PREGNANT AND WITH ONE HELPER. AND SHE WAITED FOR HIM. PEOPLE TRIED TO COME AND TAKE  HER TO CIVILIZATION. SHE STAYED THERE BY HERSELF, HAD  THE BABY BY HERSELF AND THEN HE  HAD ALREADY BEEN ASSASSINATED IN  MEXICO.
Jon: THEY SHE... UNBEKNOWNST TO HER. Jon: THAT'S WILD. THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH. SHE STAYED IN TEXAS.
Jon: TEXAS HAS THE STRAIN OF  A REBELLIOUSNESS WHERE YOU'RE  NOT SURE, EVEN BACK THEN DO THEY BELONG TO THE SPANISH OR MEXICAN  TERRITORIES, IN THE UNITED  STATES THERE'S THAT STREAK OF LIKE WE'RE TEXANS. WE'RE NOT REALLY A PART OF  ANYTHING. WE'RE OUR OWN ENTITY.
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A WHOLE  HISTORY OF FIGHTING THE  ELEMENTS, HARSH WEATHER, HARSH LAND, THE COMANCHE RAIDS WHICH  WERE VERY BRUTAL TO THE PEOPLE  SETTLING OUT WEST. THERE IS THAT INDEPENDENCE AND  THAT KIND OF CAN-DO SPIRIT STILL  IN TEXAS.
Jon: THEY STILL HAVE THAT  THING. OBVIOUSLY EVERY PIONEERING IN  DIFFERENT AREAS SORT OF HAS  THAT. BUT THEY REALLY HELD ON TO THAT  TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T  MESS WITH THEM.
WELL, THEY DID FIGHT FOR  THEIR INDEPENDENCE. FROM MEXICO. AND THEN THEY WERE A REPUBLIC  FOR TEN YEARS. AND THEN THEY CAME INTO THE  NATION AS A NATION UNDER TREATY. THAT FIERCE INDEPENDENCE IS WHAT  HAS REALLY PASSED THROUGH THE  GENERATIONS.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS  HAPPENED TO TEXAS WITH LIKE THIS  GUY CRUZ? AND RICK PERRY? BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOOD.
WELL, LET ME SAY... (LAUGHING).   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU KNOW, LOOK, AND WHAT  COUNTRY DO THEY WANT TO JOIN  NOW?
TED CRUZ IS VERY BRIGHT. Jon: VERY. PRINCETON GRADUATE. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. HE'S A BRIGHT PERSON. SO I THINK THAT HE IS VERY  COMMITTED TO HIS CAUSE OF TRYING  TO KEEP AMERICA FREE.
Jon: SURE. EVERYTHING YOU SAID COULD HAVE  DESCRIBED LEX LEUTOR.
(LAUGHING)  Jon: HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET  ABOUT THE SENATE. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU COSPONSORED,  WHAT WAS IT, AN INFRASTRUCTURE  BANK WITH KERRY, RIGHT?
I DID  Jon: IT'S A BIPARTISAN, VERY  MODERATE, VERY HARD TO ARGUE  WITH AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. IT GETS SHOT DOWN. BACKGROUND CHECK ON GUNS, GETS  SHOT DOWN IN THE SENATE SO TO  SPEAK. NO PUN INTENDED. TOO MANIY COMES OUT AND SAYS ONE  OF THE REASONS WHY IS THE  REPUBLICANS WERE TOLD ANY COOPERATION WITH OBAMA IS A  VICTORY FOR HIM SO WE WILL GIVE  HIM NONE. THEY DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO LOOK  BIPARTISAN. HOW CRAZY IS THAT?
WELL, LET ME SAY PAT TOO  MANIY, THE SENATOR FROM  PENNSYLVANIA, DID A YEOMAN'S JOB
Jon: HE AND JOE MANCHIN GOT A  COMPROMISE BILL.
REALLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  ARE FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS. THEY ARE
Jon: LIKE 90%. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: RIGHT BUT HE HAS COME  OUT AND SAID, IF THAT DICTATE  HAD NOT GONE OUT FROM SENATOR McCONNELL, MORE OF HIS  COLLEAGUES WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR  IT. SOME OF THEM BELIEVE IN  BACKGROUND CHECKS BUT THEY  DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE OBAMA A  VICTORY. AND HASSLES SAID IF THE N.R.A. DIDN'T SCORE IT, THEY WOULD HAVE  HAD 70 VOTES INSTEAD OF 54.
WELL, THE LATTER THING THAT  YOU HAVE SAID IS PROBABLY MORE A  REASON. I DON'T THINK MITCH McCONNELL  PUT OUT A DICTATE OF HOW YOU  SHOULD VOTE ON THIS. I THINK IT WAS...
Jon: HASN'T THAT BOOK COME  OUT THOUGH McCONNELL, YOU GUYS  WERE AT A RETREAT. I THINK YOU WERE STILL IN THE  SENATE. YOU WERE PROBABLY THERE AND HE  SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO  COOPERATE WITH THIS  ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM ANY  BIPARTISAN VICTORY. EVEN A SENATOR WENT ON RECORD AT  THAT MEETING AT THE LIBRARY OF  CONGRESS. YOU GUYS WERE IN THE BASEMENT OF  THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.
I DON'T THINK MITCH EVER  MEANT TO SAY WE'RE NEVER GOING  TO COOPERATE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAUSE HE...
Jon: BUT... HE DIDN'T NEGOTIATE. HE NEGOTIATED OFF THE FISCAL  CLIFF. MITCH McCONNELL DESERVES A LOT  OF CREDIT. HONESTLY HE DOES. HE AND JOE BIDEN, YES. HE AND JOE BIDEN LITERALLY...
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK THAT HAS  A RESOUNDING EFFECT ON A CAUCUS  WHEN THE LEADER SAYS, HEY, MAN, WHATEVER HAPPENS, IF YOU WORK  WITH THIS GUY, THAT'S A VICTORY  FOR HIM. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THINK OF ALL THE COMMON SENSE  THINGS. INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT HAVE  FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE BECAUSE OF  THIS.
WELL THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK  I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR  OUR COUNTRY. PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT WITH  PUBLIC AND BUILD BRIDGES AND  WATER SUPPLIES
Jon: IN THE SENATE THAT  YOU'RE IN THERE, THE SAUCER OF  AMERICAN DEMOCRACY WHERE BAD IDEAS COME TO, LIKE BROWNIES ON  A WINDOW SILL. HOW DOES THAT IDEA NOT GET PAST  THAT BODY IF IT DOESN'T GET PAST  THEM, YOU KNOW, THE HOUSE ISN'T GOING TO DO IT. IT'S LIKE ANIMAL HOUSE IN THE  HOUSE.
WELL, ON THAT POINT, IT WAS  SO MUCH LESS OF A... OF AN ISSUE  IN THE FOREFRONT. I THINK IF WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN  THAT OUT AND IF WE HADN'T HAD  THE FISCAL CLIFF AND SEQUESTRATION AND THE HIGH DEBT
Jon: THAT WAS SELF-CREATED. WELL, BUT I'M SAYING THOSE  THINGS TOOK PRECEDENT. I DO THINK FROM INFRASTRUCTURE  BANK GOES IN THAT THERE WILL BE  A LOT OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I HAVE TO ALSO SAY THERE WAS  BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THE  AMENDMENT THAT WOULD KILL THE BACKGROUND CHECKS. I MEAN THAT WAS NOT ALL  REPUBLICANS EITHER
Jon: YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT IT WOULD HAVE PASSED THE  MAJORITY. FOR SOME REASON THE THRESHOLD  WAS 60 RATHER THAN 50. IT WOULD HAVE PASSED THE 50  CERTAINLY BUT YOU DON'T MISS IT  AT ALL, DO YOU?
I DON'T. Jon: HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT  PROBABLY DOES AND I SAY THIS AS  I SEE THE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES THAT HAVE PROBABLY GONE OUT. IT KILLS YOUR SOUL. DOES IT NOT?
IT'S VERY HARD RIGHT NOW. IT'S THE HARDEST. I'VE BEEN THERE. I'VE BEEN THERE 20 YEARS AND I  HAVEN'T MISSED ONE MINUTE.
Jon: JANE LONG HAS AN  OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THE  UNITED STATES AND STAY ON THE ISLAND ALONE. AND IT'S THE ISLAND. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. UNFLINCHING COURAGE IS ON THE  BOOK SHELVES RIGHT NOW. KAY BAILEY HUTCHINSON.
THANK YOU SO
