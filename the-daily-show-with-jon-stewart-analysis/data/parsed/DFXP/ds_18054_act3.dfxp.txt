[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT NEW FILM IS  CALLED "IDENTITY THIEF".
DON'T SHUT DOOR, LEAVE IT.
NOW, THIS IS HIS FAVORITE  PART. HE LIKES TO BE HUMILIATING  VERBALLY.
NO I DON'T.
YOU SISSY BOY.
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THIS.
SISSY BOY. IT'S TIME TO GIVE HIM THE BIG  SHOW. BOOM BOOM!
NO NEED FOR THE SHOW. PUT IT BACK ON. WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW, JASON BATEMAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MAGIC! MAGIC. YOU ARE A MAGIC MAN. YOU ARE A MAGIC MAN! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING WORSE  THAN A QUARTER STANDING OVATION. GOOD LORD, THANK YOU FOR LEADING  THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'M WORKING OUT HOW  WE'RE GOING TO EDIT AROUND THAT. HOW ARE YOU? THE MOVIE, MELISSA McCARTHY --
DID YOU SEE IT?
Jon: THE MOVIE IS GREAT. IT LAGS A BIT --
HEY.
Jon: DO YOU REMEMBER THE  OLD SONNY AND CHER SHOW?
I DO NOT.
Jon: CHER WAS A COMIC. SHE WAS A ROCKET TO THE STARS. YOU COULD NOT HOLD HER BACK. WHEN SHE WAS ON CAMERA IT WAS  ELECTRIC.
AM I SONNY, GODDAMN IT?
Jon: THERE WAS A BASS  PLAYER IN THE BAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
OH --
Jon: SONNY ALSO HAD A  LITTLE SOMETHING.
I WAS FEELING PRETTY TODAY.
Jon: DO YOU LIKE --
MY COLON LOVED IT.
Jon: YOU WERE GREAT  TOGETHER. IT'S A GREAT INTERPLAY.
SHE'S NOT CRAZY. WHICH IS NUMBER ONE FOR GETTING  ALONG WITH A COSTAR AND HAVING  GOOD CHEMISTRY. L.A. DOES NOT AL TRACT A LOT OF  WORLD BEATERS. SPECIFICALLY THE ENTERTAINMENT  INDUSTRY. BY DEFINITION WE'RE LOOKING FOR  ATTENTION.
Jon: IT'S A NARCISSISTIC  PURSUIT TO SOME EXTENT.
STOP CUTTING ME OFF! [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: EDITY AROUND IT.
-- EDIT AROUND IT.
THAT WAS A TIE-IN TO THE  NARCISSISM.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. I THINK THEY JUST ENJOYED THE  SLAM OF IT.
SHE'S SO DARN EASY TO GET  ALONG WITH AND SHE'S FUNNY AND  SHE'S PROFESSIONAL AND SHE WORKS  HARD.
Jon: SHE ALSO. I ASKED HER ALSO ABOUT YOU. I DON'T WANT TO RUN THE CLIP  OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A  LONG FLIGHT HOME AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT TO YOU.
DID SHE THINK SHE WAS WORKING  WITH NATHAN OR JERRY O'CONNELL? I GET IT ALL THE TIME.
Jon: BRECKEN MEYER.
I GET HIM, TOO.
Jon: DO YOU REALLY?
I GET JUSTIN THREE TIMES A  WEEK. HEY, JUSTIN, I LOVE EVERYTHING  YOU DO. BUDDY, YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME.
Jon: WHY JUSTIN.
I THINK THEY DO A HYBRID WITH  JUSTINE THAT COMES OUT JUSTIN.
Jon: I THEY DROP THE SILENT  E. I WAS THINKING IT'S A LITTLE  TIMER LAKE-Y. YOU BRING THE SEXY BACK. YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS.
AND JON, CAN I SING.
Jon: ARE YOU A TRIPLE  THREAT.
CAN I HAVE A SEGMENT -- I I  DON'T SING.
Jon: CAN I ASK A QUESTION  DO YOU HAVE TIME TO STICK AROUND  AND GO TO THE WEB? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE  UNUSUAL NIGHTS WHERE I CAN'T  STAY. I HAVE --
IT'S NOTHING AGAINST YOU  THERE'S -- [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S A GASTROENTER ROLINGS  THAT I GO TO ON THE UPPER EAST  SIDE WHOSE OFFICE HOURS ARE MESHUGGENAH BUT I'M GLAD YOU  COULD STAY.
OR IF YOU NEED THAT  COLONOSCOPY.
Jon: YOU ARE A QUADRUPLE  THREAT. YOU CAN SING AND DO A  COLONOSCOPY. IT'S FUN TO PLAY BECAUSE YOU ARE  JUST FUNNY MAN. IN THE MOVIES ON THE TALK SHOWS.
HEY, MAN.
Jon: IT'S JUST GOOD AND YOU  AND MELISSA ARE REALLY GOOD  THERE.
THE MOVIE TURNED OUT VERY,  VERY WELL. I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF IT.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE 20  SECONDS?
SURE. ONE OF WORST EXPERIENCES-LIFE I  WAS JUST -- NO, NO,. I WAS WATCHING A TASTEFUL MOVIE  ONE OF HIGH BROA FILMS I I LIKE  TO GO TO WITH MY WIFE.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TANGLED?
AND A TRAILER COMES ON FOR A  FILM THAT I'M NOT PARTICULARLY  PROUD OF BUT I WAS IN IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT WILL GO NAMELESS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND A GAL A FEW SEATS DOWN FROM  ME. THE PREVIEW HAPPENS IT'S NOT  GETTING A GREAT REACTION FROM  THE CROWD. GOES TO BLACK GETTING READY FOR  THE NEXT TRAILER. SILENCE IN THE MOVIE THEATER  WHERE YOU HEAR A SMART ASS POP  OFF. SHE'S SITTING TO MY RIGHT AND  SHE GOES, ANYWAY -- AND I SO  BADLY BECAUSE I LIKE TO HAVE THE LAST JOKE OF THE TRAILER, TOO. IF I LEANED FORWARD AND SAID,  NOT FOR YOU? I WANTED TO JUST TRIPLE BITCHY  BUT I WAS JUST TOO MORTGAGEIFIED  TO MOVE -- MORTIFIED TO MOVE.
Jon: JUSTIN BATEMAN, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN. IT'S IN THEY'RE AT THISES FRIDAY
