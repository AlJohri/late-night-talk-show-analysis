(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. LEWIS BLACK COMES ON FOR A  SEGMENT WE CALL "BACK IN BLACK."  ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS COUNTRY'S FINANCES ARE  IN THE DUMPS! WE'RE OFFICIALLY POOR! WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE  GUESS WHO'S THE BLAME?
PEOPLE WHO ARE PERFECTLY  CONTENT TO LIVE AT THE EXPENSE  OF OTHERS, THE MOOCHER CLASS OUT  THERE.
I'M GETTING FOOD STAMPS, I'M  GETTING GOVERNMENT CHECKS, I'M  GOING TO SPEND IT ON WHATEVER I  WANT.
THE BOTTOM 50% HAVE NO SKIN  IN THE GAME.
YET THEY'RE BENEFITING FROM  THE COST TO GOVERNMENT THAT  OTHERS ARE PAYING FOR. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT RIGHT.
KICK IN A BUCK.
KICK IN SOMETHING.
YEAH! THE POOR ARE SO TIGHT FISTED  THOSE PRICKS! KICK IN A BUCK! BECAUSE WHAT PROBLEM CAN'T BE  SOLVED THE SAME WAY YOU ORGANIZE  A BEER RUN? (LAUGHTER)  WELL, IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO  KICK IN MONEY WE'RE GOING TO  HAVE TO RAISE IT SOMEHOW. I GOT IT! CIGARETTE TAX!
A VERY REGRESSIVE TAX. IT WILL BE RAISED FROM CIGARETTE  SMOKERS WHO ARE  DISPROPORTIONATELY POOR AND  POORLY EDUCATED.
SO, THE RIGHT WANTS THE POOR  TO KICK IN, JUST NOT THEIR  CIGARETTE MONEY. WHEN IT COMES TO COUGHING UP A  BUCK OR A LUNG, LUNG WINS. (APPLAUSE)  THERE MUST BE SOME WAY TO  SEPARATE POOR PEOPLE FROM THEIR  HARD-MOOCHED MONEY.
THE TAX OF 1% PER OUNCE ON  SOFT DRINKS SWEETENED WITH SUGAR  COULD BE AN AMAZING SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM.
PERFECT! MAKE THOSE CIGARETTE-SMOKING  SODA-GUZZLING DUMMIES PAY FOR  THEIR OWN OBAMACARE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE NOTION THAT SODA IS BEING  PLACED ON A LIST OF SINS WORTHY  OF BEING TAXED INTO OBLIVION WILL HURT MORE POOR PEOPLE THAN  ANYBODY ELSE.
YES. CONSERVATIVES WILL FIGHT FOR THE  POOR'S RIGHT TO SEE THE ONLY  DOCTOR WHO DOESN'T MAKE YOU  HEALTHIER! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  SO WE CAN'T TAX CIGARETTES OR  SODA. GUNS?
I'M WORRIED THAT PARTICULARLY  POOR PEOPLE, THE ONES WHO ARE  MOST LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES, PARTICULARLY  POOR BLACKS IN HIGH-CRIME URBAN  AREAS ARE GOING TO BE PRICED OUT OF BEING ABLE TO OWN A GUN. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
YES! THE CITIZENS OF POOR AREAS IN  AMERICA TODAY SUFFER GREATLY  FROM THE SCOURGE OF GUN STICKER  SHOCK. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE BLEEDING THEM DRY-- OF  THEIR MONEY! WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT TO  TAX THESE THINGS ANYWAY? WHAT ARE THEY GONNA USE ALL THAT  MONEY FOR?
PART OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  SIGNATURE HEALTH CARE PLAN BE  PAID FOR IN PART WITH MONEY FROM A SUGARY DRINK EXCISE TAX.
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.
THAT WOULD PAY FOR POLICE. THAT WOULD PAY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY  PROGRAMS.
UNIVERSAL PRE-K WILL BE PAID  FOR BY A CIGARETTE TAX.
SMOKING TO SUPPORT EDUCATION? THAT MEANS I CAN START MY OWN  CHARTER SCHOOL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GO FIGHTING -- (COUGHING)  (LAUGHTER)  SO IF WE RAISE TAXES, IT HURTS THE POOR. IF WE DON'T RAISE TAXES, IT  HURTS THE POOR. I THINK WE ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION  HERE. (BLEEP) THE POOR! (LAUGHTER)  WE'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THE  ROMANS. JON?
Jon: THANK YOU, LEWIS. LEWIS BLACK, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
