Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE GOT A NICE ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT! BEN AFFLECK, DIRECTOR, ACTOR,  WRITER BEN AFFLECK WILL BE  JOINING US WITH A GREAT NEW  MOVIE "ARGO."  BUT FIRST. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --  (LAUGHTER)  WITH JUST FOUR WEEKS TO GO TO  ELECTION DAY THE INSURMOUNTABLE,  UNBLOWABLE LEAD THE THAT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ENJOYED  POST-CONVENTION --  (LAUGHTER)  -- HAS BEEN MOUNTED AND MOAN BY  MITT ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER)  (LAUGHTER)  NO? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I STAND BY THAT PHRASE. (LAUGHTER)  AND IT IS NOW MITT ROMNEY WHO  CANNOT BE MOUNTED OR BLOWN. I -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A BETTER  -- WILL THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF  SAYING THIS, I'M SURE. SO PERHAPS NOW IS THE TIME TO  ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT  OUR FUTURE OVERLORD HAS BEEN  SAYING. (LAUGHTER)  HIS DREAMS, HIS ASSESSMENT OF  THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY NOW  THAT HE IS 100% ASSURED OF  WINNING THIS ELECTION AS OBAMA WAS JUST LAST WEEKEND. (LAUGHTER)
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. IT IS NOT WORKING. TRILLION-DOLLAR DEFICITS FOR THE  LAST FOUR YEARS. THERE'S OVER $16 TRILLION IN  DEBT. HARDER AND HARDER FOR SMALL  BUSINESSES TO GROW AND THRIVE. THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE'RE ADDING  AT A TRILLION A YEAR IS SIMPLY  NOT MORAL.
Jon: NOT MORAL! (LAUGHTER)  THAT MEANS FOR MITT ROMNEY THIS  TERRIBLE DEBT IS WORSE THAN OF  FEPT. (LAUGHTER)
JON?
YES, MORMON GOD.
NOT COOL, BRO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SHOULDN'T YOU BE ON  BROADWAY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO, NO!
Jon: LITTLE JOKE THERE. BUT ALL RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN  IRRESPONSIBLE WITH GOVERNMENT  SPENDING. ROMNEY, BRING THE TOUGH LOVE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LOSE?
I DON'T WANT ANY CHANGE TO  MEDICARE FOR CURRENT SENIORS OR  FOR THOSE THAT ARE NEARING  RETIREMENT. NO CHANGE IN SOCIAL SECURITY FOR  THOSE THAT ARE IN RETIREMENT OR  NEAR RETIREMENT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, SO IT'S  IMMORAL DEBT BUT HANDS OFF THE  CORE ENTITLEMENTS! THEY'VE LITERALLY BEEN  GRANDFATHERED IN--  GRANDMOTHERED. (LAUGHTER)  PROBABLY THE MORE PERIPHERAL  ENTITLEMENTS GOT TO GO.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE  HAVE THE KIND OF TRAINING  PROGRAMS THAT GIVE PEOPLE THE  SKILLS THEY NEED FOR THE JOBS OF  TODAY.
Jon: OKAY, SO HANDS OFF  CHINESE LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION  PROGRAMS. (LAUGHTER)  I GUESS THE CUTS ARE GOING TO  COME FROM BIG SPENDING BOON DOOG  STUFF LIKE DEFENSE.
I'LL RESTORE OUR NAVY TO THE  SIZE NEEDED TO FULFILL OUR  MISSIONS. BY BUILDING 15 SHIPS PER YEAR,  INCLUDING THREE SUBMARINES.
Jon: IT MAY SOUND FISCALLY  IRRESPONSIBLE --  (LAUGHTER)  -- BUT WITH THREE SUBMARINES  JUST SEVEN MORE AND AMERICA GETS A FREE SANDWICH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO BIG DEFENSE PROJECTS -- DID  YOU ENJOY THAT? BIG DEFENSE PROJECTS AND THE  SOCIALIST PROGRAMS, THOSE WILL  NOT BE TOUCHED. LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S RAISING  TAXES.
I'M GOING TO LOWER RATES  ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL  AMERICANS BY 20%.
Jon: WHAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THIS IS INCREDIBLE! WE GET TO KEEP ALL OUR STUFF AND  PAY LESS TOO? THIS IS LIKE THOSE SPECIAL  POTATO CHIPS THAT THEY MADE WITH  OLESTRA THAT HAD ALL THE FLAVOR  --  (LAUGHTER) BUT NONE OF THE CALORIES AND, OF  COURSE, EVERY NOW AND AGAIN  THERE WAS A HINT -- A SKOSH OF  AGE LEAKAGE BUT IT'S FINE. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE IN A MEETING  AND YOUR ASS WOULD DO A SPIT  TAKE BUT --  (LAUGHTER)  BUT THE POINT IS THIS. THEY WERE DELICIOUS. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT RED BLOODED AMERICAN  WOULDN'T TRADE FLAVOR FOR  OCCASIONAL ASS-JUICE? (LAUGHTER)  THE POINT IS -- BY THE WAY, I AM  JUST GOING TO ASSUME THEY ARE  NOT A SPONSOR. (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T -- THAT'S A PHONE CALL I  DON'T THINK I WOULD WANT TO  TAKE. ROMNEY, WHAT ARE YOU CUTTING? ANYTHING?
OBAMACARE ADS TRILLIONS TO  OUR DEFICITS AND TO OUR NATIONAL  DEBT. I WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S SOMETHING. AND WHILE THE STATEMENT  "OBAMACARE ADDS TRILLIONS TO OUR  DEFICIT AND TO OUR NATIONAL  DEBT" IS A LIE! (LAUGHTER)  IT'S A COMPLETE LIE. (LAUGHTER)  THE POINT IS IT'S GOING. WE HAVE AN IMMORAL DEBT. WHILE COVERING PEOPLE WITH  PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND  KEEPING PEOPLE ON THEIR PARENT'S  HEALTH INSURANCE IS POPULAR, CUTS HAVE TO BE MADE.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS  THAT I LIKE IN HEALTH CARE  REFORM. ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE  WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN  GET COVERAGE. TWO IS TO ASSURE THAT THE  MARKETPLACE ALLOWS FOR  INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE POLICIES  THAT COVER THEIR FAMILY UP TO WHATEVER AGE THEY MIGHT LIKE.
Jon: SO YOU'RE REPEALING  OBAMACARE BUT YOU'RE KEEPING THE  GOOD PARTS OF HEALTH CARE,  SOCIAL SECURITY, AND MEDICARE FOR CURRENT SENIORS AND YOU'RE  GOING TO KEEP THE EMPLOYMENT AND  YOU'RE GOING TO CUT TAXES BY 20%  AND BUILD MORE SUBMARINES AND DESTROYERS THAT THE PENTAGON  DOESN'T WANT AND TACKLE OUR  IMMORAL DEBT AND DEFICIT. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. LET ME SEE IF I GOT IT HERE. AS AN AMERICAN VOTER-- AND I  THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT-- ARE  YOU A WIZARD? (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DO YOU KNOW OR HAVE YOU EVER  CAPTURED A LEPRECHAUN? (LAUGHTER)  IS THERE A GOOSE IN YOUR HOUSE  WHOSE EGGS ARE GIGANTIC AND  UNLIFTBLY HEAVY IN? BECAUSE IF NOT, YOU'RE LYING! (LAUGHTER)
LET'S GET RID OF THE  LOOPHOLES, DEDUCTIONS, SPECIAL  DEALS SUCH THAT WE'RE ABLE TO  PAY FOR THE REDUCTIONS.
Jon: OH, THAT'S HOW YOU'LL  PAY. CLOSING LOOPHOLES. LET'S DO IT. WHAT ARE WE STARTING WITH? MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE  DONATIONS? THAT'S $150 BILLION A YEAR IN  THE GOVERNMENT KITTY.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU  UNDERSTAND, FOR MIDDLE INCOME  FAMILIES THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF  HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST AND THE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS, THOSE  THINGS WILL CONTINUE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: KITTY STILL HUNGRY. HOW ABOUT THE CAP AL GAINS  LOOPHOLE THAT LOWER TAX RATE ON  INVESTMENT INCOME. THAT'S $71 BILLION AYEAR,  GIVEAWAY TO 1%ERS IF THERE EVER  WAS ONE.
ONE OF THE REASON THAT IT'S  LOWER IS BECAUSE CAPITAL HAS  ALREADY BEEN TAXED ONCE AT THE  CORPORATE LEVEL. AS HIGH AS 35%. I, SO I YOU THINK IT IS FAIR?
YEAH, I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT  WAY TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC  GROWTH.
IN FACT, ROMNEY HASN'T  SPECIFIED A SINGLE (BLEEP)ING  DEDUCTION! TEN LARGEST CURRENT INDIVIDUAL  TAX BREAKS TOTALING $4842  BILLION A YEAR FOR ELIMINATION,  NOT ONE. DUDE COULDN'T BE MORE VAGUE IF  HE WERE AN HBO SEASON FINALE. BOOM! BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  TAKE THAT "HUNG" SEASON 3. (LAUGHTER)  HOW COULD HE THEY NOT LET US  KNOW WHAT RAY IS GOING TO DO  NEXT WITH HIS GIANT DONG? (LAUGHTER)  WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT ROMNEY TO  LAY OUT A SPECIFIC PLAN WITH  NUMBERS AND BUDGETS. HE'S NOT A BUSINESSMAN, HE'S --  SORRY? (LAUGHTER)  WE NEED A NUMBERS GUY.
THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME, I'M  KIND OF A NUMBERS GUY.
Jon: THERE HE IS! THE CAPITOL HILL ACCOUNTANT! THE WONK FROM WISCONSIN. THE MATHEMATICIAN FROM --  MADISON'S GENERAL VICENTE FOX  CINDY. LAY IT ON US, NUMBERS GUY. HOW DO WE KNOW THE ROMNEY/RYAN  FISCAL PLAN WILL WORK?
I'VE RUN THE NUMBERS IN  CONGRESS, THEY DO.
Jon: OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS?
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST?
IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?
IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME MATH.
WELL, I DON'T HAVE THE -- IT  WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG TO GO  THROUGH ALL OF THE MATH.
Jon: HOW ABOUT THIS? YOU BUSY? LEAVE IT WITH US, WE'LL LOOK IT  OVER. (LAUGHTER)  UNLESS IT'S ALL BULL (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  THIS REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING. REMINDS ME OF A SIMPLER TIME  WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO  EMERGING FROM A GIGANTIC  FINANCIAL CRISIS AND A BOLD YOUNG MAN RUNNING FOR HIS SECOND  PRESIDENTIAL TERM WAS ASSERTING  THE NEED FOR WEALTHIER AMERICANS  TO SACRIFICE TO HELP PAY FOR POPULAR SOCIAL PROGRAMS. I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS  YESTERDAY.
LET ME WARN YOU AND LET ME  WARN THE NATION AGAINST THE  INVASION THAT SAYS "OF COURSE WE  BELIEVE THESE THINGS. WE BELIEVE IN SOCIAL SECURITY. WE BELIEVE IN WORK FOR THE  UNEMPLOYED. WE BELIEVE IN SAVING HOMES. CROSS OUR HEARTS AND HOPE TO  DIE. WE BELIEVE IN ALL THESE THINGS."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT WE DO NOT LIKE THE WAY  THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IS  DOING THEM! JUST TURN THEM OVER TO US. (LAUGHTER)  WE WILL DO ALL OF THEM. WE WILL DO MORE OF THEM. WE WILL DO THEM BETTER. AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, THE  DOING OF THEM WILL NOT COST  ANYBODY ANYTHING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YEAH, I BET THAT GUY  LOST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
