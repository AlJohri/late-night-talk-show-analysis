[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW. LAST WEEK AMERICA FINALLY  MADE GOOD ON ITS THREAT TO  ITSELF IN THE FORM OF  ARBITRARY SPENDING CUTS KNOWN AS THE SEQUESTER. WE SENT AL MAD GRAL TO  WASHINGTON TO SEE FIRSTHAND  THE OUTRAGE.
LAST WEEK THE MUCH FEARED  SEQUESTER BECAME A REALITY.
IT'S NOW IN EFFECT. 85 BILLION IN AUTOMATIC  SPENDING CUTS.
JUST HOURS AFTER IT WAS  SIGNED INTO LAW I WENT  OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE TO SEE THE OUTRAGE FIRSTHAND.
IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATING.
CONGRESS DOESN'T TEND TO  WORK ON ANYTHING UNTIL  THERE'S A CRISIS.
THAT MAN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE PROMISED TO TAKE CARE  OF SITUATION. WHERE IS HE NOW?
I REALIZED IT WAS AN  ISSUE. I-DEGREE GREW UP IN PUERTO  RICO. WE TAKE IT SEAR YOUR --  SERIOUSLY.
SORRY WHERE?
PUERTO RICO.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
STATEHOOD.
THIS WASN'T ABOUT THE  SEQUESTER. THEY WITNESSED THE AMERICAN  GOVERNMENT'S INABILITY TO  FUNCTION BUT THAT DIDN'T  STEAM DETER THEM. THEY COULDN'T GET ANYTHING  DONE AND YOU WANT IN?
THAT'S CORRECT.
HOW BAD IS (bleep)  PUERTO RICO. THEY'VE ONLY HAD ONE  NONVOTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS  WHICH THEY THINK IS WORSE  THAN HAVING A CONGRESSMAN THAT COULD VOTE.
THEY LET ME VOTE ON  COMMITTEES BUT NOWHERE ELSE.
YOU ARE LIKE A BACK-UP  QUARTERBACK ON THE NFL. YOU GET TO TRAVEL WITH THE  TEAM AND DON'T GET HURT.
WELL --
THERE COMES SACRIFICES. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE  THIS BUT IF YOU BECOME A  STATE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT  PARADE ANYMORE.
WHY?
MONTANA DOESN'T HAVE THE  PARADE.
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE  PARADE WE HAVE LESS WILDING  OPPORTUNITIES. MY PEEPS CAN GO CRAZY  SOMETIMES.
NOT THE BEST PITCH WHICH  IS AN INTERESTING POINT. WHAT ARE THEY BRINGING TO  THE TABLE?
YOU NEED US. WE CAN BRING BASEBALL TO  THIS WONDERFUL NATION. GOOD RUM.
THAT IS ONE THING WE'RE  MISSING SPORTS LIQUOR.
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED MORE  OF.
DO THEY EVEN UNDERSTAND  HOW THE CONGRESS WORKS? I PUT THEM THROUGH THE PACES  OF A MOCK CONGRESSIONAL  FILIBUSTER. LET'S SAY PUERTO RIEWKER  GETS STATEHOOD AND YOU ARE A  SENATOR. YOU ARE ON THE FLOOR WHAT  TYPES OF THINGS ARE GOING TO  ACCOMPLISH?
NOT ONLY WILL I MAKE SURE  THAT PUERTO RICO IS  INCLUDED.
I HAVE THE FLOOR IT'S MY  TURN TO TALK. WHOLE CORN, OIL.
EXCUSE ME. I HAVE THE FLOOR. I'M FILIBUSTERING YOU.
I HAVE THE RIGHT I'M A  SENATOR.
I'M FILIBUSTERING YOU.
OKAY. YOU ARE MAKING A SPECTACLE  OF YOURSELF.
SORRY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. AS I WAS SAYING.
MILK, CHEESE CULTURES.
WHEN I BECOME A SENATOR  AND I'M PART OF THE UNITED  STATES CONGRESS.
WHEY.
IN THE END ADDING A 51ST  STATE TO THE UNION CREATES A  TRULY INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM A DESIGN PROBLEM. WE HAVE 50 STATES RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW.
PUERTO RICO MAKES IT 51.
I KNOW IT'S UNEVEN.
WHAT STATE HAS TO GO?
CAN I BE HONEST? I THINK DELAWARE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS  THERE THAT MAKES A  DIFFERENCE TO ANYONE IN THE  UNITED STATES.
GET RID OF THEM. YOU HEARD IT. SUCK IT, DELAWARE.
YES, IT'S THE TRUTH.
SORRY MR. VPT YOUR HOME  STATE HAS TO GO. BUT DON'T WORRY THE  TERRITORY OF DELAWARE JUST  GOT ITSELF ONE KICKAS
