[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT, VERY EXCITED. WE HAVE THE LEAD VOCALS FROM  RADIO HEAD AND FLEA FROM CHILI  BAND. PLEASE WELCOME THOM YORKE AND  FLEA FROM ATOMS FOR PEACE. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
WHAT IS THAT?
STRAIGHT VODKA.
Jon: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. I EXPECT NO LESS. HOW DID -- HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? THAT YOU AND YOU COME TOGETHER? WHAT IS THE GENESIS OF A BAND  SUCH AS THIS?
I WAS HANGING OUT BACK STAGE  AT ONE OF HIS SHOWS AND HE WAS  TALKING ABOUT A RECORD I DID ON  MY OWN CALLED "THE RAZOR." AND I THOUGHT A FEW MONTHS  LATER, I WANT TO TRY TO PLAY IT  LIVE. I WANT TO GET A BAND TOGETHER. I E-MAILED YOU AND JOEY AND SOME MORE FRIENDS AND SAY, DO YOU  WANT TO DO IT? THEY ALL GOT BACK IN A COUPLE  HOURS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
Jon: AND YOU PUT IT TOGETHER.
I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM  THOM.
Jon: IT'S HARD TO HEAR FROM  ROCK STARS.
I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL --
I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL.
I DANCED AROUND THE HOUSE  LIKE A HINGED ANIMAL SCREAMING  LIKE -- AND I WENT BACK AND  SAID, OH, I'D BE DELIGHTED.
Jon: DOES THIS CREATE WITHIN  YOUR BAND, IS THERE A SENSE OF  LIKE OH, DO YOU NOT LOVE US  ANYMORE? DO THEY COME TO YOU AND SAY OH,  YOU'RE GOING TO USE FLEA? HE'S GOOD. [LAUGHTER] LIKE HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT IN  YOUR OTHER PROJECTS?
I THINK IT'S ALL HEALTHY,  RIGHT? IT'S ALL HEALTHY TO FREE RANGE A BIT.
Jon: YEAH, I SAY THAT TO MY WIFE.
YEAH.
IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE A  ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BEING IN A BAND.
Jon: IT IS. I SAW YOU GUYS IN 86, I THINK.
FOR 30 YEARS. WE STARTED 30 YEARS AGO.
Jon: THAT'S INCREDIBLE. [APPLAUSE] INCREDIBLE.
BUT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY  TO PLAY WITH THOM AND NIGEL AND  JOEY AND PLAY WITH MUSICIANS I  RESPECT THAT ARE INTERESTED IN  PUSHING BOUNDARIES AND REACHING  FORWARD AND CURIOUS ABOUT NEW  SOUNDS, IT'S A GREAT  OPPORTUNITY. SO I'M JUST HUMBLE.
Jon: THAT'S GREAT. LOOK AT YOU. IS IT DIFFICULT TO GET A NEW  GROUP TO GEL? WHEN YOU HAVE THE MEN, DO YOU  HAVE IN YOUR MIND A CERTAIN  SOUND AND A CERTAIN RHYTHM  YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OR DO YOU SAY I LIKE FLEA'S STYLE AND RHYTHM  AND I'M GOING TO ADJUST A LITTLE BIT TO THAT? HOW DOES THAT COME TOGETHER?
IT WAS LIKE I COULD ONLY  THINK OF FLEA BECAUSE FLEA PLAYS BASS LIKE A LEAD INSTRUMENT.
LIKE NOBODY EVER PLAYED IT. TREMENDOUS.
THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANTED  TO HAPPEN. WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS -- IT WAS NO  IDEA. YOU DON'T KNOW.
Jon: DID THE WRITING PROCESS  TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF  TIME?
WE SORT OF DID IT ON OUR OWN. BUT THE SOUND CREATED WAS NOT  SOMETHING I EXPECTED. IT WAS REALLY EXCITING. AN EXPERIMENT THAT WORKED.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT THIS ALBUM  IS. YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY TWO SONGS  OFF OF THAT FOR US.
ONE FROM THAT AND ONE --
Jon: ONE FROM THE OLDER ONE. THEN I MOST LIKELY WILL OFF  CAMERA DANCE LIKE A LOSER. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE BACK. ATOMS FOR PEACE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
