(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT THE NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR YAHOO! NEWS, HIS NEW BOOK CALLED "ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT, THE WEEK POLITICS WENT TABLOID." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MATT BAI. MATT!
NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS "ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT. THE WEEK POLITICS WENT TABLOID." I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SO THIS CONCERNS GARY HART RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 1987.
1987.
AND I WAS ALIVE THEN. I WAS AN OLD MAN THEN, EVEN THEN. BUT IN REREADING, IN GOING IT OVER, I HAVE MISREMEMBERED ALMOST THE ENTIRE AFFAIR.
YES.
AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU FOUND THE GARY HART AFFAIR HAS ITS OWN SORT OF LEGEND AND THAT MUCH OF IT IS NOT TRUE?
YES. YES, ARE YOU NOT ALONE. BASICALLY EVERYTHING PEOPLE REMEMBER ABOUT THIS, IF THEY REMEMBER IT AT ALL, IS NOT TRUE. EVERYBODY THINKS THERE WAS A PICTURE OF THE WOMAN DONNA RICE ON HIS LAP AND THAT DROVE HIM OUT OF THE RACE.
Jon: RIGHT.
IN FACT --
Jon: AND THE T-SHIRT THAT SAYS, WHAT IS IT, MONKEY BUSINESS.
MONKEY BUSINESS.
Jon: YEAH.
IN FACT, IT DIDN'T DRIVE HIM OUT OF THE RACE IT WAS THREE WEEKS AFTER THE RACE AND IT WASN'T TAKEN ON A BOAT, IT WAS TAKEN ON A DOCK WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE MILLING AROUND. AND THE BIGGEST THING I THINK PEOPLE MISREMEMBER, IS EVERYBODY THINKS HE SAID FOLLOW ME AROUND. AND-- .
Jon: RIGHT, HE CHALLENGED REPORTERS, YOU THINK I'VE GOT A PROBLEM. FOLLOW ME AROUND, I WILL PROVE I DON'T.
RIGHT, THE REALITY IS HE DID SAY THAT TO A SINGLE REPORTER, BUT IT WAS NOT PUBLIC OR KNOWN TO ANYONE AT THE TIME WHEN THE "MIAMI HERALD" SENT A BUNCH OF REPORTERS TO GO PUT HIM UNDER SURVEILLANCE AT HIS TOWN HOUSE.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT, AS YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE BOUNDARIES WEREN'T ACTUALLY REWRITTEN BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LIVES BECAUSE GARY HART SAID LET'S REWRITE THEM. IT ACTUALLY WAS A MEDIA DECISION, IT WAS A DECISION MY INDUSTRY MADE. AND HERE YOU HAVE THE PRESUMED NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HE'S THE HILLRY CLINTON OF HIS DAY.
Jon: RIGHT.
WAY AHEAD IN THE POLLS. PINNED UP AGAINST A BRICK WALL ON THE SIDE OF HIS TOWNHOUSE.
Jon: RIGHT. THEY CHASED HIM OUT OF THE BACK DOOR OF HIS HAT, YES? -- OF, OF HIS HOUSE.
YEAH, YEAH, WEARING A WHITE HOODIE. AND THEY'RE PEPPERING HIM WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO IS THE WOMAN IN YOUR HOUSE, HAVE YOU HAD SEX WITH THAT WOMAN, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. IN THAT ALLEY, I THINK THE RULES OF POLITICS AND POLITICAL JOURNALISM CHANGED FOREVER. IT'S A GRIPPING STORY.
Jon: THE IDEA TOO THAT, YOU KNOW, IN THIS DAY AND AGE PEOPLE CATCH THINGS ON CELL PHONES AND THINGS. THIS WAS SET UP SURVEILLANCE.
YES.
Jon: TO CATCH A GUY BASED ON AN ANONYMOUS TIP.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: THAT HAD COME IN, THAT HE WAS HAVING A DALLIANCE. AND PART OF THE ISSUE IS, WHEN DID THAT BECOME FODDER FOR THE CAMPAIGN. BECAUSE CERTAINLY KENNEDY, CERTAINLY JOHNSON, CERTAINLY MANY OF THE POLITICIANS THAT HAVE RUN THIS COUNTRY AND WE IDOLIZED, HAD ISSUES LIKE THIS.
RIGHT. WELL, CHARACTER WAS ALWAYS A PART OF POLITICS. AND SOMETIMES SEX BECAME A PART OF POLITICS. THE MEDIA DID NOT GO LOOKING FOR IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND NO ONE WAS SORT OF COMPLETELY DEFINED AND DISGRACED IN THE WAY QUITE THAT HE WAS BEFORE. AND THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON, AS YOU MENTIONED THE SATELLITE DISH.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU HAD THIS GENERATION COMING INTO JOURNALISM AFTER WATERGATE THATS HAD WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN IN THEIR MINDS AND ALSO WHAT THEY SEE AS THE MORAL FAILURES OF NIXON AND THAT THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO YOU HAVE A LOT THAT IS CHANGING WITH HIM.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND IN THAT CAULDRON, HART SORT OF WALKS INTO IT. I MEAN, IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I THINK IT WAS INEVITABLE. I DON'T THINK THE "MIAMI HERALD" DID THIS, I DON'T THINK GARY HART DID THIS. I THINK SOMEBODY HAD TO WALK INTO IT.
Jon: IF IT WASN'T GARY HART, IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.
ABSOLUTELY. YEAH. BUT WAS HIM AND I THINK THAT MOMENT TELLS US A LOT OF HOW WE GOT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE WHERE OUR POLITICS FEEL SO STERILE AND OUR POLITICIANS SO REMOTE AND OUR JOURNALISM, OFTEN...
Jon: RIGHT.
SO NOT ILLUMINATING FOR THE THINGS THAT MATTER.
Jon: SO AT THIS POINT, THE GENERAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS ARE POLITICIANS BECOME INCREDIBLY CAUTIOUS. THEY DON'T-- IT BECOMES NOW ABOUT REALLY SCRIPTING A CAMPAIGN IN A WAY THAT DID NOT EXIST PRIOR TO THAT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
DID NIXON DID NOT DO THAT, KENNEDY -- I MEAN, THEY MUST HAVE ALL HAD SPIN TEAMS BUT WERE THEY MORE, WERE THEY LESS GUARDED WITH THE PRESS THAN THEY ARE NOW?
MUCH MORE SO. MUCH MORE SO.
Jon: YEAH.
AND YOU KNOW, YOU SEE IT, IN THAT MOMENT, JUST AFTER THAT STAKEOUT, RIGHT, THEY GO TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THERE IS THIS FAMOUS NEWS CONFERENCE WHERE THE REPORTER FROM "THE WASHINGTON POST" PAUL TAYLOR SAYS IN FRONT OF A CROWDED ROOM OF PRESS SAYS TO HART, SENATOR, HAVE YOU EVER COMMITTED ADULTERY. NO CANDIDATE WAS EVER ASKED THAT KIND OF BLANKET QUESTION.
Jon: AND DO YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S, IT'S EASIER, IT'S MORE SALACIOUS, IT SELLS MORE PAPERS THAN TRYING TO FIND OUT THE MORAL FABRIC OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH REAL VIRTUES THAT MATTER IN GOVERNANCE?
WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY AFTER RICHARD NIXON THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE AND GENUINE FEELING THAT PERSONAL MORALITY MATTERED MORE.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT CHARACTER HAD ACTUALLY DONE HIM IN AND DONE THE COUNTRY IN MORE THAN POLICY. AND SO THERE WAS A, THERE WAS A REASONABLE IMPULSE THERE. BUT I THINK MOSTLY WE HAVE VEERED AND BEGAN TO VEER IN THAT MOMENT INTO THE REALM OF ENTERTAINMENT. INTO THE IDEA THAT CAMPAIGNS AND POLITICS HAD TO UNFOLD LIKE STORY ARCS, HAD TO HAVE CHARACTERS, HAD TO HAVE PLOT TWISTS.
Jon: A DRAMATIC NARRATIVE.
WE HAD TO HAVE, SUDDENLY WE HAD THESE SATELLITE DISHES AND YOU COULD GO LIVE FROM ANYWHERE AT ANY POINT. AND YOU HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING TO GO LIVE WITH.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND REMEMBER THAT SAME YEAR IS THE JIM BAKER AND TAMMY'S FAYE BAKER SCANDAL.
Jon: YES.
WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A GREAT TIME WITH.
Jon: OH YES.
WITH THE MASCARA STREAKED FACE AND ALL THAT.
Jon: SO MUCH MAKEUP.
AND FAWN HALL AND OLVER NORTH.
Jon: FAWN HALL, RIGHT. THEY WENT ON A JAG.
ALL THE SAME YEAR.
THEY WENT ON A CRAZY -- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YEAH
Jon: THAT WAS --
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT MOMENT COMING --
Jon: AND I DIDN'T REALIZE, I DIDN'T REMEMBER HART WENT BACK INTO THE RACE.
YES, HE DOES.
Jon: HE WENT BACK IN.
YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S THE DECISION I THINK HE REALLY REGRETTED.
Jon: RIGHT.
IS HE SORT OF WALKED AWAY AND HE SAID THIS IS NOBODY'S BUSINESS, AND THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A CAMPAIGN AND I'M NOT GONNA PUT PEOPLE THROUGH THIS.
Jon: AND THEN HE JUMPED BACK IN.
HE CAME BACK IN IT WENT VERY, VERY POORLY. HE REGISTERED 0 PERCENT IN IOWA WHICH IS NOT IDEAL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: RIGHT. THAT IS TRUE. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE, BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT POLITICS IS COVERED NOW, DO YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE LOST OUT ON TRULY GREAT AND POSSIBLY GREAT LEADERS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE COVER THEM? ARE THERE, AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HYPOTHETICAL, BUT DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SUBSTANCE WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS COUNTRY GREAT THINGS, WHO WE WILL JUST NEVER KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF OUR POLITICS?
I DO, JON. I HAVE BEEN COVERING NATIONAL POLITICS FOR 15 YEARS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND HAVE COVERED FOUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. I DO THINK WE LOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO PUT THEMSELVES THROUGH THIS UNENDUREABLE PROCESS, OR THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH IT. I THINK WE DRUM GOOD PEOPLE OUT OF POLITICS WHO ARE DEFINED BY THE SINGLE WORST THING THEY HAVE EVER DONE AS OPPOSED TO THE CONTEXT OF THEIR PUBLIC LIVES AND I THINK WE MAKE IT MUCH MUCH EASIER FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO BUSINESS HOLDING OFFICE TO ENTER THE PROCESS. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IDEAS AND WORLDVIEWS AND AGENDA. WHEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CHARACTER AND PERSONALITY, IT MAKES IT VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE TO FLOAT THROUGH THE PROCESS WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES OR DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY KNOW. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT WAS AWESOME. YOU SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN. THAT WHOLE THING YOU JUST SAID.
I THINK I DID.
Jon: "ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT." IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, MATT BAI.
THANK YOU.
