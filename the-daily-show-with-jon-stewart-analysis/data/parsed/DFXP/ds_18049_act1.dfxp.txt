FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT MISSING  CUMMINGS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR  OF AYER NAUGHTIC AND  ASTRONAUTICS AT MIT AND INSTRUCTS THE NAVY ON AUTONOMOUS  WARFARE. SHE POSSESSES THE BIGGEST CUTE  NAME TO LARGEST JOB GAP IN OUR  NATION'S HISTORY. [ LAUGHTER ] I WANT TO THANK OUR AUDIENCE  TRULY BRAVING PERILOUS WEATHER  CONDITIONS. THIS IS HOW I GOT TO WORK THIS  MORNING. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH. BECAUSE IN NEW YORK CITY IT'S  COLDER THAN A WITCH'S TITTY IT'S  NEW YORK! IT MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING. GORM -- GORMING IS A TOTAL --  GLOBAL WARMING IS A TOTAL HOAX  AND HERE IS HOW I KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S COLD TODAY WHERE I LIVE. THAT'S. ♪ ♪  JUST SCIENCE. IN FACT, IF ANYTHING THERE'S A  NEW ICE AGE COMING TODAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE I LIVE. WHICH WE'RE TOTALLY UNPREPARED  FOR BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SO  UNSEASONABLY WARM THIS WINTER. TOUCH WONDER WHO IS PERPETRATING  THIS GLOBAL WARMING HOAX. CLIMATE SCIENTISTS ARE TOO DUMB  TO PULL IT OFF. AND ALL OF OUR SUPERVILLAINS ARE  SAFELY LOCKED UP AT AN ASYLUM  AND THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE MAN CAPABLE OF THIS HOAX. PERHAPS NOTED MANTEI TEO  PRANKSTER RONAIAH TUIASOSOPO  TUIASOSOPO! STOP IT WITH THIS COLD! TUIASOSOPO! OUR LIPS ARE TURNING  BLU-ASOSOPO. WE'LL CATCH THE FLU-ASOSOPO. BECAUSE I HAVE A KIND OF WEAK  IMMUNE SYSTEM BECAUSE I'M A  JEW-ASOSPO. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO BE SORRY TO SEE  THIS GUY GO QUITE FRANKLY. HERE WE ARE, LISTEN TWO DAYS  SINCE BARACK OBAMA'S  INAUGURATION SPEECH IN WHICH HE MAY RECALL YOU GAVE AN  UNAPOLOGETIC DEFENSE OF THE  SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND ADDRESSED THE CRITICISM OF ENTITLEMENT.
THE COMMITMENTS WE MAKE TO  EACH OTHER THROUGH MEDICARE,  MEDICAID AND SOCIAL SECURITY. THESE THINGS DO NOT SAP OUR  NATION, THEY STRENGTHEN US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY DO NOT MAKE US A NATION OF  TAKERS, THEY FREE US TO TAKE THE  RISKS THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY  GREAT.
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING. THE PRESIDENT IS USING A  RHETORICAL DEVICE IN THIS SPEECH  THAT IS -- WHAT IS IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HELP ME OUT  VANQUISHED VICE PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE PAUL RYAN, WHAT IS HE  DOING?
THAT RHETORICAL DEVICE HE  USES OVER AND OVER AND OVER A  STRAW MAN.
Jon: ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT  A STRAW MAN IS WHEN YOU CREATE  OR FALSELY CHARACTERIZE A OPPONENT'S ARGUMENT TO DISMANTEL  THE ARGUMENT. I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS  THROWING YOUR OWN WORDS BACK IN  YOUR FACE WITHOUT NAMING YOU. PASSIVE AL GRETION. THAT'S WHAT HE IS USING. PASSIVE AGGRESSION. THIS ARGUMENT AS A STRAW MAN. I COULD HAVE SWORN I HEARD A  POLITICIAN MAKE THAT EXACT  STATEMENT.
WE COULD BECOME A SOCIETY  WHERE THE AMERICANS ARE NOT  TAKERS VERSUS MARKERS. WE NEED MORE MAKERS AND LESS  TAKERS IN AMERICA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO TO BE FAIR YOU  DON'T WANT TOO MANY MAKERS IT'S  A WHOLE OTHER PROBLEM. SERIOUSLY HAVE YOU BEEN ON ETSY? IT'S ALL WE GET IT, YOU HAVE A  GLUE GUN, OKAY! SLAM! LOOK, YOU CAN'T SAY THE TAKERS  ARGUMENT WASN'T A PART OF YOUR  CAMPAIGN CONGRESSMAN RYAN. THIS IS LOOKING LESS LIKE A MAN  MADE OF STRAW AND MORE LIKE A  MAN MADE OF TIE TITANIUM. REALLY THREE 20 MINUTE WORKOUTS  A WEEK. THAT'S ALL -- I DON'T BUY THAT  FOR A SECOND. HOW DID OBAMA MISCHARACTERIZE  THE MAKERS/TAKERS ARGUMENT?
NO ONE IS SUGGESTING WHAT WE  CALL THE EARNED ENTITLEMENTS  LIKE PAYROLL TAXES FOR MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY ARE PUTTING  YOU IN A TAKER CATEGORY. NO ONE SUGGESTS THAT WHATSOEVER.
Jon: WHEN YOU WERE SAYING  TAKERS YOU DON'T MEAN SWEET OLD  GRAMS YOU MEAN HOBO JOE. I GOT IT. BUT HERE IS THE THING:  BACK IN  2011 CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN WAS  PRETTY SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW HE DEFINED TAKER. ACCORDING TO THE TAX FOUNDATION  BETWEEN 60% AND 70% OF AMERICANS  GET MORE BENEFITS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAN THEY PAY  BACK IN TAXES. WE'RE GETTING TO A SOCIETY WHERE  WE HAVE A NET MAJORITY OF TAKERS  VERSUS MAKERS.
Jon: YOU ARE DEFINING TAKER  AS AS 70% OF SOCIETY. THAT'S (bleep) TAKERS. IMAGINE HOW HIGH THAT PERCENTAGE  WOULD BE IF HE INCLUDED SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICARE RECIPIENTS ON THE TAKER LIST. YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE IT  BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE HIGHER  BECAUSE IT INCLUDES IT ON THE TAKER LIST, SOCIAL SECURITY AND  MEDICARE ACCORDING TO THE TAX  FOUNDATION REPORT SIGHTED BY A PAUL REYA, SORRY RYAN. IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICARE ON THE  TAKERS LIST YOU CAN'T GET TO ROMNEY'S MORE GENEROUS 47% TAKER  TO MAKER RATIO. IF TAKERS WERE JUST WELFARE  RECIPIENTS IT WAS 2%. I HAVE TO TELL YOU NOBODY EVER  WON AN ELECTION DEMONIZING SUCH  A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS. WELL, HARDLY ANYONE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE IDEA THAT REPUBLICANS  CHARACTERIZED EVEN SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICARE AS  HALMAKES OF A TAKERS SOCIETY -- HALLMARKS OF A TAKER SOCIETY  I'LL LET THE SPEAKERS DESCRIBE  IT.
WE BUILT IT.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE THEY BUILT  IT.
PERFORMING I BUILT IT. ♪ I BUILT IT ♪
Jon: YEAH, YOU BUILT IN THAT  (bleep). I KNOW A GREAT WEB SITE WHERE  YOU CAN SELL IT IF YOU HAVE A  GLUE GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS THE DAY -- HERE IS WHAT  I DON'T UNDERSTAND -- WHAT IS  THE DANGER OF RECEIVING HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHEN YOU  NEED IT?
WE RISK HITTING A TIPPING  POINT IN OUR SOCIETY WHERE WE  HAVE MORE TAKERS THAN MAKERS, WHERE WE WILL HAVE TURNED OUR  SAFETY NET INTO A HAMMOCK THAT  ALLOWS ABLE BODY PEOPLE TO LIE IN COMPLAISCY WHICH DRAINS THEM  OF THEIR WILL AND INCENTIVE.
Jon: I'LL GIVE YOU THIS:   THAT SAY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF  WHAT A HAMMOCK DOES. [ LAUGHTER ] TO RYAN'S LINER POINT THAT  GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS DRAIN YOUR  INITIATIVE, MOST OF THE FOOD STAMP AND MEDICAID TAKERS ARE  THE WORKING POOR WHO I'M SURE  WOULD LOVE HAMMOCK TIME BUT THEY ARE TOO BUSY FLIPPING BURGERS OR  WORKING LITERALLY THE SWING  SHIFT IN A WINDOWLESS HAMMOCK  FACTORY. TRY WALKING IN THEIR SHOES OR  YOUR SHOES WHEN AT 16 YOU  RECEIVED GOVERNMENT BENEFITS.
I DID NOT SEE MYSELF AS A  VIFNLGT I SAW MYSELF ON A ROAD  OF OPPORTUNITY TRYING TO REALIZE MY VERSION OF AMERICAN DREAM  TRYING TO PURSUE HAPPINESS.
Jon: SO YOU DIDN'T FALL  INTO THE HAM HOCK. THAT FREED YOU UP TO PURSUE YOUR  AMERICAN DREAM. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SENTMENT. WHERE I HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE.
THESE THING DOZEN NOT SAP OUR  INITIATIVE, THEY STRENGTHEN US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY DO NOT MAKE US A NATION OF  TAKERS, THEY FREE US TO TAKE THE  RISKS THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY  GREAT.
Jon: OH ! SO THE RHETORICAL DEVICE OBAMA  USED WASN'T A STRAW MAN, IT  WASN'T EVEN PASSIVE AGGRESSION, IT WAS
