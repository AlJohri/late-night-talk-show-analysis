WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  DRAMA AND CO-FOUNDER OF THE  BAND THE ROOST, HIS NEW  MEMOIR IS CALLED MO METER  BLUES. PLEASE WELCOME THE FANTASTIC  QUEST LOVE THOMPSON.
HOW ARE YOU DOING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOW ARE YOU DOING.
OKAY.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO  LONG TO START AN INTERVIEW  LIKE THIS. [BLEEP] SWEET BOW TIE. CAN WE GET A CLOSE UP OF  THAT. LOOK AT THAT.
YEAH.
SCRABBLE TILES WONDER BOW  TIE.
I GOT IT IN BROOKLYN,  YEAH.
YES, YOU DID. YOU DIDN'T NEED TO SAY THAT  BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT  WAS THE CASE. THE BOOK IS FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.
AND I THINK WE'LL BOTH  AGREE THAT THAT IS OFTEN NOT  THE CASE WITH MUSS IG BOOK-- MUSICIAN BOOKS. MOST MUSICIAN BOOKS CAN  SHAKE YOU OFF IN ABOUT 30  PAGES.
YEAH.
BUT THIS IS LIKE, IT'S  PART MEMOIR, IT'S PART AN  INSIGHT NOT MUSIC THAT YOU  LOVE. IT'S PART ANTHOLOGY OF  HIP-HOP AND PART YOUR  MANAGER SHOUTING AT YOU IN  FOOTNOTES.
YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
I'VE BEEN, MY MANAGER  RICHARD NICKELS KIND OF  STEALS THE SHOW BECAUSE I TOLD MY EDITOR THAT I THINK  THAT HE SHOULD PROVIDE THE  SORT OF FOOTNOTES FROM THE VOICE OF GOD TO CONTRADICT  EVERY STORY THAT I HAVE EVER  TOLD ABOUT THE LIFE THAT I  LIVED.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW, AND PRETTY MUCH  IT SEEMS THAT CONTRADICTION  IS WHAT MAKES THE BOOK  ENTERTAINING.
IT IS GREAT, SO FUNNY. BECAUSE EVERY STORY HAS A  FOOTNOTE WITH BASICALLY RICH  SAYING LISTEN, IT WASN'T QUITE LIKE THAT. BASICALLY EVERY FOOTNOTE IN  THE BOOK HE IS BASICALLY  CALLING BULL [BLEEP] ON YOUR MEMORY 6 AN EVENT.
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S REALLY GREAT. AND THERE'S A MOMENT IN  THERE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT  THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MOMENTS YOU THINK IN THE HISTORY OF  HIP-HOP BEING AN EPISODE OF  THE KOSBY SHOW OPINIONS  YEAH.
THERE IS THE EPISODE OF  THE KOSBY SHOW IN WHICH THEO  AND DENISE GET HIT BY STEVIE  WONDER.
YEAH.
AND STEVIE WONDERS WAY OF  APOLOGIZING FOR PUTTING  THEIR LIFE IN DANGER IS SHOWING HIM THE NEW TOY  SAMPLER. SO BASICALLY THE ENTIRE  KOSBY CLAN GOES TO THE  STUDIO AND SAYS ONE WORD IN  THE MICROPHONE AND IT GOES AS STEVIE'S SAMPLER. AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY  HIP-HOP LUMINARY THAT  DEVELOPED ACROSS THE '90s IN  THE 2,000, THEY SAW THIS EPISODE AND IT CHANGED THEIR  LIVES BECAUSE WE NEVER SAW A  SAMPLER BEFORE. YOU KNOW, THE TECHNOLOGY WAS  INVENTED BUT THAT'S THE  FIRST TIME WE SAW IT. SO FOR CHRISTMAS I GOT A TOY  CASIO SK SAMPLER. YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY HAD 3  SECONDS SO YOU COULD SAY  CURSE WORDS, YOU KNOW, [BLEEP].
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT  YOU DO.
BUT WHEN I MET MY PARTNER  AND THE GROUP BLACK THOUGHT  HE WAS THE ONE THAT, LIKE, WOULD SAY LIKE YO, PUT  DRUMBEATS IN THAT. AND SO I --
I JUST LOVE THE IDEA THAT  YOU CAN TRACE BACK A PIVOTAL  MOMENT IN HIP-HOP HISTORY TO A CAR CRASH IN THE KOSBY  SHOW.
YEAH.
THAT IS THE BUTTERFLY  EFFECT.
THAT CHANGED EVERYONE'S  LIFE.
EXACTLY, THE BUTTERFLY  EFFECT.
ALSO, YOU ARE A HUGE  MUSIC ENTHUSIAST. YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW  MEMORIES OF SPECIFIC SONGS  CONJURE UP ALMOST  INEXPLICABLE THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD. YOU TALK ABOUT CURTIS  MAYFIELD'S FEDDIE'S DEAD AND  HOW WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SONG  NOW YOU JUST THINK ABOUT BURNING YOURSELF ON A  RADIATOR.
YEAH, SPECIFICALLY, WHEN  I WAS-- PEOPLE, WELL, I WAS  ASKED WHAT WAS MY FIRST MEMORY OF SOUL TRAIN.
RIGHT.
WHICH EVERYONE THAT KIND  OF KNOWS ME KNOWS THAT I AM  ABSOLUTELY ADDICTED TO. AND SO I GUESS I WAS RUNNING  FROM THE BATHTUB AND I  SLIPPED AND BURNED MY ENTIRE RIGHT LEG ON THE RADIATOR  LEAVING AN IMPRINT LIKE A  TRAIN MARK THERE BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT, THE MODULATED  BRIDGE OF FREDDIE'S DEAD IS  ON SOUL TRAIN. AND SO WHENEVER I HEAR THAT  TO THIS DAY T JUST  TRAUMATIZES ME TO NO END. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUSIC  CAN JUST HAVE UNINTENDED  EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES. I REMEMBER ONCE I WAS  BREAKING UP WITH THIS GIRL. AND WELL, LET ME CORRECT  THAT. SHE WAS VERY MUCH BREAKING  UP WITH ME.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
I HAVE BEEN THERE.
I WAS REALLY UP SET. AND AS SHE WAS EXPLAINING  WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING,  AIN'T NO SUNSHINE WHEN SHE'S  GONE BY BILL WIDTHERS CAME ON AND I LAUGHED BECAUSE I  THOUGHT THAT IS JUST TOO  RIDICULOUSLY PERFECT. SO I STARTED LAUGHING AS SHE  WAS BREAKING UP WITH ME. AND SHE SAID SEE, THIS IS  EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT. SO NOW IT'S THE SAME THING. EVERY TIME I HEAR BILL  WITHERS I KIND OF LAUGH AT  ONE OF THE GREATEST BREAK UP  SONGS IN HISTORY.
THAT TENDS TO HAPPEN. FOR ME JUST BECAUSE THERE  WASN'T A LOT OF TV WATCHING  IN MY HOUSEHOLD, BUT THERE WAS CONSTANT MUSIC PLAYING.
RIGHT.
SO EVERYTHING HAPPENED TO  A SOUNDTRACK. AND THAT'S JUST HOW I  REMEMBER EVERYTHING.
LOOK, THE BOOK IS, IT'S  AWESOME, FUNNY, INTERESTING,  INSPIRING. AND THERE IS SOME AMAZING  STORIES THERE IS AN IN HERE  WHERE YOU GO ROLLER SKATING WITH PRINCE. I DONE KNOW IF THERE IS ANY  BETTER REASON TO BUY BOOKS  THAN TO FIND OUT THE CONTEXT OF THAT ANECDOTE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE CONTEXT WOULDN'T MAKE  ANY MORE SENSE BUT IT IS AN [BLEEP] AMAZING STORY. MO BETTER BLUE-- MO METER  BLUES IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES,  QUEST LOVE THOMPSON.
