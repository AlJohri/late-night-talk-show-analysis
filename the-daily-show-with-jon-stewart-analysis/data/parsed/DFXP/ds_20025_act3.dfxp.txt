Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER, HER LATEST FILM IS CALLED "CITIZENFOUR."
WHEN DID YOU THINK TO GO PUBLIC?
I THINK IT'S PRETTY SOON. I MEAN WITH THE REACTION, THIS ESCALATED MORE QUICKLY. I THINK PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS THEY START TRYING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT ME, WHICH SHOULD BE ABOUT ANY DAY NOW.
YEAH.
I'LL COME OUT. JUST GO HEY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF SOMEBODY SKULKING AROUND IN THE SHADOWS. THESE ARE PUBLIC ISSUES.
YEAH.
THESE ARE NOT MY ISSUES, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, THESE ARE EVERYBODY'S ISSUES. AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BULLY ME INTO SILENCE LIKE YOU HAVE DONE TO EVERYBODY ELSE. IF NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO DO IT, I WILL. AND HOPEFULLY WHEN I'M GONE, WHATEVER YOU TO DO TO ME, THERE WILL SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WILL DO THE SAME THING. IT WILL BE SORT OF INTERNET PRINCIPLE OF THE HYDRA, YOU KNOW YOU CAN STOMP ONE PERSON BUT THERE'S GONNA BE 7 MORE OF US.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME LAURA POITRAS. (APPLAUSE) THANKS FOR BEING HERE. I GOT TO TELL YOU, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE DOCUMENTARY. SUSPENSEFUL, REVEALING. I MEAN EVERYTHING THAT YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE IN A DOCUMENTARY. BUT EXPLAIN HOW YOU GOT ACCESS TO EDWARD SNOWDEN AND HOW YOU PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER IN A HOTEL ROOM IN HONG KONG BEFORE THIS HAD EVER BECOME PUBLIC.
WELL, IT'S-- I'M GLAD YOU LIKED THE MOVIE. AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, IT IS VERY SUSPENSEFUL BECAUSE I STARTED RECEIVING STRANGE, MYSTERIOUS ANONYMOUS E-MAILS IN JANUARY 2013.
Jon: SURE. I GET THOSE. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, I KNOW. AND SAYING KIND OF REALLY, YOU KNOW, BIZARRE THINGS. SAYING LIKE THAT I HAD CHOSEN MYSELF. AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT I WAS WATCHED EVERY TIME THAT I CROSSED THE BORDER. BUT I TOOK IT PRETTY SERIOUSLY. AND STARTED WRITING BACK AND WE CORRESPONDING OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE MONTHS.
Jon: AND HE WAS CALLING HIMSELF CITIZENFOUR.
THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS USING AN ANONYMOUS E-MAIL ACCOUNT. OF COURSE I USED AN ANONYMOUS E-MAIL ACCOUNT. WE DID ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS TO KEEP THE COMMUNICATION SECURE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEN IT ENDED UP THAT GLENN GREENWALD AND I TRAVELED TO HONG KONG. WE MET WITH HIM.
Jon: NOW THIS IS, AT THIS POINT, HE KNEW THAT THE INTERVIEW THAT HE DID WITH GLENN WAS GOING BECOME PUBLIC.  NOT-- HE WASN'T GOING TO BECOME PUBLIC BUT THE ISSUE.
YEAH. I MEAN, HE HAD A BIT OF A-- I MEAN, HE BELIEVES THAT THE ISSUE IS WHAT HE WANTS PEOPLE TO CARE ABOUT -- HE DIDN'T COME FORWARD BECAUSE HE WANTED THE ATTENTION. BUT HE KNEW THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT THE MEDIA WOULD TALK ABOUT HIM. SO HE MADE THE DECISION. AND THEN GLENN AND I STARTED PUBLISHING. AND THEN WHEN-- ONCE IT WAS CLEAR THE GOVERNMENT KNEW THAT HE WAS PROBABLY THE SOURCE, THE GOVERNMENT VISITS HIS HOUSE WHILE WE'RE STILL IN HONG KONG.
Jon: THEY TALK TO HIS GIRL FRIEND.
YEAH, THEY TALK TO HIS GIRLFRIEND. THERE'S SOMEBODY VISITING. AND THEN WE PUBLISHED THE INTERVIEW. AND THEN KIND OF THINGS GOT A LITTLE CRAZY.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT IS SO INCREDIBLE. SO YOU ARE IN THIS LITTLE HOTEL ROOM IN HONG KONG AND YOU ARE WATCHING AS THE STORY CATCHES FIRE IN A WAY THAT I THINK SEEMS TO CATCH EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT OFF GUARD. JUST THE FEROCITY OF IT, AND THE EXPANSION OF IT.
YEAH, I MEAN GLENN AND I, I THINK WE DIDN'T EXPECT THERE WOULD BE THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION THERE WAS ON IT, AND FROM THE FIRST STORY THAT GLENN DID ON VERIZON, WHICH SHOWS THE NSA IS COLLECTING ALL OF OUR PHONE RECORDS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT WAS A HUGE STORY. IT WENT EVERYWHERE. AND SO IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE BEING IN A TIME CAPSULE IN THIS HOTEL ROOM AND THEN WE, YOU KNOW, THEN WE LEFT.
Jon: IT WAS FASCINATING TO WATCH HIM BECAUSE KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT HIM AND ONLY THROUGH THE -- YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS SORT OF HAD A SENSE THAT SORT OF A NARCISSISTIC GUY, A LITTLE BIT OF, YOU KNOW, SELF-PROMOTING. DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY AT ALL. HE SEEMS REALLY CONFLICTED ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.
YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: HE SEEMS TO NOT REALIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE OFF AT THAT SAME LEVEL. BUT HE KNOWS IT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING LIKE IT PAINTS A VERY COMPLEX BUT MUCH MORE SYMPATHETIC PORTRAIT OF A GUY. I THINK EVERYONE HAD THIS SENSE THAT HE IS A MASTERMIND. HE SEEMS MUCH LESS THAT IN THE FILM.
NO I MEAN, HE IS REALLY SOMEBODY WHO HE FELT THAT HE WAS SEEING THINGS THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW ABOUT AND HE DID NOT INTERESTED IN THE ATTENTION. WHEN I ASKED TO FILM WITH HIM, HIS FIRST RESPONSE WAS NO, I'M NOT THE STORY. HE SAYS THAT CONSISTENTLY. BUT I CONVINCED HIM, I KIND OF MADE A MOVIE ABOUT HIM SO I GUESS HE'S THE STORY NOW.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I DON'T RECOMMEND DOING THAT, MAKING --
YEAH, I KNOW. MAKING MOVIES IS HARD.
Jon: SO WHAT IS SO-- I THINK WHAT ALMOST HEARTBREAK ABOUT THIS, SO NOW ALL THIS INFORMATION COMES OUT. WE KNOW IT ALL. THE GOVERNMENT LIES ABOUT IT. THEY TESTIFY ABOUT IT, CLAPPER SAYS WE'RE NOT DOING -- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HAS TO COME BACK A COUPLE MONTHS LATER, OKAY, YEAH, WE WERE DOING THAT.
YEAH.
Jon: BUT IN A WEIRD WAY IT JUST SORT OF LAYS THERE. SO NOW WE KNOW IT AND WE'RE ALL, HMMMM, WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING. YET HIS LIFE IS IMPACTED IN A WAY THAT IS DEVASTATING.
YES. BUT HE KNEW THOSE RISKS. I MEAN HE WENT IN, I THINK HE WAS READY TO ACCEPT ANY RISKS, AND FEELING THAT THIS WAS JUST INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW. AND I THINK HE FEELS GOOD ABOUT THAT.
Jon: IS IT HARD FOR HIM? I MEAN, HE'S IN RUSSIA AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE UNDER AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME THAT IS FAR MORE SUPPRESSING OF INFORMATION THAN ANYTHING WE DO. IS THAT SEEM LIKE A CRUEL IRONY TO HIM?
I MEAN, IT'S NOT WHERE HE EVER INTENDED TO BE. HE WAS TRANSITTING THROUGH, HE WAS TRYING TO LEAVE HONG KONG TO GET TO LATIN AMERICA AND HIS PASSPORT WAS REVOKED AND THAT'S HOW HE ENDED UP THERE. IT'S, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, HIS INTENTION WAS TO MEET THE JOURNALISTS AND TO MAKE INFORMATION THAT HE FELT WAS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST PUBLIC.
Jon: WAS HE NAIVE, DO YOU THINK?
I MEAN, I THINK HE WAS NAIVE IN THE SENSE THAT HE FELT THAT, SO WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS A CONSTITUTION AND THAT HE FELT --
Jon: NO, IT'S BEEN SHREDDED, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU  SAW EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM.
I KNOW. YEAH.
SHREDDED A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TIMES. OH YEAH, THE WHOLE THING'S GONE NOW.
IT'S GONE, YEAH. SO HE SORT OF STILL BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION, AND BELIEVES-- .
Jon: HE SEEMS VERY IDEALISTIC.
HE IS VERY IDEALISTIC. AND HE BELIEVES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT IS STILL THE LAW AND THAT OUR PRIVACY, YOU KNOW, MATTERS. AND SO YEAH, HE'S IDEALISTIC.
Jon: I WANNA -- SO, CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT?
YEAH.
Jon: WE'LL COME BACK. I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT, HOW HE MADE THE DECISION TO DO IT IN THE MANNER THAT HE DID, AS OPPOSED TO SORT OF, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WHISTLE-BLOWER CASES LIKE THE DRAKE CASE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT THREATENED THEM WITH TREMENDOUS, LIKE A LOT OF HEAT ON THEM. AND IS THAT WHY HE CHOSE TO GO THE ROUTE THAT HE WENT? BUT WE'LL GET INTO THAT IN A LITTLE BIT. "CITIZENFOUR," IN THEATRES NOW, MAN, FASCINATING. LAURA POITRAS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
