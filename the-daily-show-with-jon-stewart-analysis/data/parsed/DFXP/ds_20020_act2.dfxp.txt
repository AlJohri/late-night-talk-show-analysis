Jon:  WELCOME BACK. SO, THE DAY AFTER THE DEMOCRATS GOT THEIR BALLS WAXED, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ACTION WHETHER THE NEW CONGRESS WAS WITH HIM OR NOT.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID HE WILL BYPASS CONGRESS WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION REFORM.
I'M EAGER TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO LAWFULLY THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM. WHAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IS JUST WAIT.
Jon:  I MEAN, IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS. SHOULD I CALL THEM? SHOULD THEY CALL ME? I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T WANT TO LOOK DESPERATE, BUT I AM A LITTLE DESPERATE. BUT IT DOES RAISE THE QUESTION. HE IS EXCITED ABOUT DOING STUFF NOW BUT WHAT WAS HE DOING BEFORE THE ELECTION?
MORE CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS DELAYED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTIONS.
EVERYTHING FROM THE NOMINATION OF A NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DECISIONS ON THE CONTROVERSIAL KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE, IMMIGRATION REFORM, CORPORATE TAX REFORM, AND RATES FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT ACTION WAS TAKEN AT THE REQUEST OF SENATE DEMOCRATS.
THREE SENATORS, MARK PRYOR, KAY HAGAN, AND MARY LANDRIEU ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO DELAY HIS DECISION TO HAVE SOME EXECTUTIVE ORDERS MITIGATING IMMIGRATION, DEPORTATION.
Jon:  SENATE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO AVOID VOTES ON CONTENTIOUS ISSUES SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE UNPOPULAR STANCE THAT MIGHT COST THEM REELECTION. AND THEY GOT PRESIDENT TO GO ALONG WITH IT. IT'S A WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL MANEUVER KNOWN AS THE CHICKEN ( BLEEP ) GAMBIT. IT'S NAMED, OF COURSE, FOR SENATOR DICKLESS H. CHICKEN ( BLEEP ). WHO, WHEN HE WAS ASKED WHETHER HE SUPPORTED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, FAMOUSLY SAID WHAT? HUH? AND THEN HAD TO PRETEND TO BE HARD OF HEARING FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT IF YOU'RE BASING YOUR AGENDA PURELY ON WHAT HELPS RED-STATE DEMOCRATS, HOW ABOUT THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE? THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS MORE POPULAR IN RED STATES THAN CHICK-FIL-A'S NEW PATRIOT BASKET. WHY NOT JUST APPROVE THAT BEFORE THE ELECTION?
FRIDAY'S OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DECISION TO DELAY CONSTRUCTIONG OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE AGAIN MAY TURN OUT TO BE A BOOST FOR DEMOCRATS WHO OPPOSE THE PROJECT. IT ALLOWS VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS FROM ENERGY-PRODUCING RED STATES ROOM TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA AND OPPOSE HIM.
Jon:  OH, COME ON. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT SO CYNICAL THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DELAY ACTION ON A PROJECT JUST SO FELLOW DEMOCRATS COULD ATTACK HIM FOR DELAYING THAT ACTION.
LOUISIANA SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU, DENOUNCING THE LATEST DELAYS SAYING, "THIS DECISION IS IRRESPONSIBLE, UNNECESSARY, AND UNACCEPTABLE."
ALASKA SENATOR MARK BEGICH SAYS, "I AM FRANKLY APPALLED AT THE CONTINUED FOOT DRAGGING BY THIS ADMINISTRATION."
ARKANSAS'S MARK PRYOR SAID, "THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR ANOTHER DELAY. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO APPROVE THIS PROJECT NOW."
Jon:  ADDING -- WINK. SO LAST APRIL, SEVEN MONTHS AGO, OBAMA DELAYS HIS KEYSTONE DECISION. RED-STATE DEMOCRATS GET POINTS FOR ATTACKING THE PRESIDENTS, BLUE-STATE DEMOCRATS GET POINTS FOR ATTACKING THE PIPELINE. IT WAS A WIN-WIN. EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. THEY ALL LOST! PRYOR LOST. HAGAN LOST, BEGICH LOST. THE ONLY ONE WHO HASN'T LOST IS LANDRIEU. SHE'S GOING INTO A RUN OFF, WHICH SHE'S GOING TO LOSE. IT'S LIKE DEMOCRATS CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN TO PRODUCE SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD ( BLEEP ) PLAY. AND BY THE WAY, THAT KEYSTONE PIPELINE? YOU DELAYED THE DECISION ON THAT BACK IN APRIL. THAT'S SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF GOVERNING TIME. THESE ELECTIONS ARE TWO YEARS APART. IF YOU TAKE OUT THE SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION, WHERE THINGS ARE GOING, AND THEN YOU GO FROM THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE NEW ELECTION WHERE THE NEW GUYS WHERE UNPACKING AND FIGURING OUT THE E-MAIL, PLUS SUMMER RECESS PLUS SPRING RECESS, AUTUMN APPLE PICKING, THE WEEK WHEN THE SENATORS' PARENTS COME TO VISIT, HOUSE OF REPS SADIE HAWKINS DANCE, OBVIOUSLY ALL THE TIME SPENT FUND-RAISING, BASICALLY THERE'S ONE DAY IN MARCH WHERE, WEATHER PERMITTING, YOU THINK YOU CAN GET ( BLEEP ) DONE WITHOUT POLITICALLY HARMING ONE THING OR THE OTHER. AND APPARENTLY, THIS YEAR, DEMOCRATS SPENT THAT DAY SITTING AROUND TRYING TO MAKE THAT SOUND. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO TO RECAP. THE DEMOCRATS' 2014 STRATEGY INSTEAD OF DOING THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THEM WOULD LIKE, THEY DECIDED TO NOT DO ANYTHING SO AS NOT TO OFFEND THE VOTERS WHO ALREADY DIDN'T LIKE THEM. ( LAUGHTER ) OR TO PUT THAT IN THE CLASSIC WORDS OF DICKLESS H. CHICKEN  ( BLEEP )? WHAT? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
