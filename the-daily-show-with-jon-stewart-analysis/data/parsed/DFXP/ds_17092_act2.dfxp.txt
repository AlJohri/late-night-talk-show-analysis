WELCOME BACK. THIS PAST WEEKEND, I WAS PERUSING MY FAVORITE POLITICAL SCIENCE JOURNAL POLITICAL SCIENCE MONTHLY  FOR THE-- TODAY POLITICAL SCIENCE SWIMSUIT ISSUE. I-- THAT IS TIGHT. I CAME A CRIES STUDY BY THE RESEARCH CENTER PROJECT FOR EXCELLENCE IN JOURNALISM  THAT SHOWED SINCE LAST NOVEMBER 17%, ONLY 17% OF CAMPAIGN COVERAGE FOCUSED ON  EITHER ISSUES OR CANDIDATES RECORD, THE REMAINING COVERAGE BROKE DOWN AT 27%  IN A NONSENSE, 19% USELESS GARBAGE AND 37% STUPID  [BLEEP]. (LAUGHTER) LIKE HOW THE ROMNEYS USED TO TRAVEL WITH THEIR DOG 30 YEARS AGO.
ONE OF THE MOST INFAMOUS ROMNEY MOMENTS.
THE INFAMOUS DOG INCIDENT WHERE HE DROVE WITH HIS POOCH STRAPPED TO THE ROOF THE CAR.
HE DROVE FROM BOSTON TO CANADA WNSDZ AND THE DOG GOT CIRCUMSTANCES HE STOPPED, HOSED HIM OFF AND KEPT GOING.
WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN.
CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE IN-- NOT WATT TENSION IT RECEIVED. (LAUGHTER)
AND THE FACT WE NORMALLY TRAVEL BY PRIVATE JET NOW. BUT HONESTLY, IT IS A DECADES AGO FAMILY TRIP. DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY THINK THAT THIS IS WORTH POLITICIZING? >>.
OBAMA ADVISOR DAVID AXELROD POSTED THIS, QUOTE, HOW LOVING OWNERS TRANSPORT THEIR DOGS.
REALLY, BLOOS IN THE BACKSEAT OF A CAR-- LOOSE IN THE BACKSEAT OF A CAR  STLCHLT AN AIR BAG BACK THERE, I DON'T THINK SO.
RESPONSIBLE LOVING OWNER TRANSPORTS HIS CANINE COMPANION IN THE CRATE OF A  BACK OF AN SUV OR DOGGIE CAR HAMMOCK THAT SAY REAL THING, OR FIVE POINT LATCH SYSTEM. I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE IF THAT ONE IS A REAL THING OR NOT. BUT IT IS-- YOU ARE PLAYING WITH TWIR, OBAMA CAMPAIGN.
CONSERVATIVE BLOGS ARE JUMPING OVER THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FED DOG  MEAT AS A CHILD IN INDONESIA WHERE HE LIVED FROM AGES 6 TO 10.
HERE IT COMES.
NOW ROMNEY ADVISOR ERIC FEHRNSTROM HAD A COMEBACK QUOTE IN HINDSIGHT A CHILLING PHOTO.
FUNNY. DICKISH, BUT FUNNY.
I HAPPEN TO KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT INTERSECTION. I LIVE THERE. LOOK, BEING GOOD TO YOUR DOGS IS NOT A LITMUS TEST OF YOUR PRESIDENCY. NIXON FAMOUSLY LOVED HIS DOG CHECKERS AND HE RESIGNED IN DISGRACE, LBJ SIGNED THE  CIVIL RIGHTS BILL AND ALSO RIPPED THE EARS OFF BEAGLES WITH HIS BARE HANDS. TRUE. TEDDY ROOSEVELT GREAT PRESIDENT, BUT GOT IN TROUBLE FOR GAMABLING WITH DOGS, WELL, THE GAMBLING  WASN'T THE PROBLEM T WAS HOW HE DEALT WITH CHEATERS. YEAH, THAT-- YOU COULD HAVE JUST SAID I DON'T KNOW, BAD DOG. ANYWAY WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
