( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FORMER  HEAD COACH OF THE U.S. MEN'S SO,  TRAEM TEAMAND IS NOW THE HEAD COACH OF THE EGYPTIAN NATIONAL  SOCCER TEAM. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW,  BOB BRADLEY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
John: EGYPT! EGYPT! BOB, THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE. I'M SO-- I'VE BEEN EXCITED TO  TALK TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE IN  AN AMAZING SITUATION. YOU'RE NOT JUST AN AMERICAN. YOU'RE AN AMERICAN FROM JERSEY. THAT'S TURBO AMERICAN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NEW JERSEY!
John: AND YOU'RE HEADING UP  THE EGYPTIAN NATIONAL SO, TEAM--  I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT WORD-- SOCCER. EVERY TIME THE BRITISH PERSON  USES THAT WORD, SOMEWHERE IN THE  WORLD ANOTHER BRITISH PERSON  DIES. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU ARE IN AN AMAZING SITUATION. YOU HAVE A VERY DIVIDED EGYPT. YOU COULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE  WORLD CUP FOR THE FIRST TIME  WHICH COULD, IN A WAY THAT NOTHING ELSE COULD, UNIFY THAT  COUNTRY. NO PRESSURE. ( LAUGHTER )
THE ONLY THING EGYPT AGREES  ON RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE MUST GO  TO THE WORLD CUP GLIEWN AND THAT'S ON YOU. THAT'S ALL ON YOU. IT'S AN AMAZING-- IT WAS AN  AMAZING JOB TO TAKE ON, AND  THERE WAS A KEY TURNING POINT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AND THAT WAS THE  PORT SAID MASSACRE, WASN'T IT.
RIGHT.
John: AND THE FACT YOU USED  THAT WORD IS KEY. WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE. THERE WAS A GAME BETWEEN TWO  PREMIERE LEAGUE TEAMS IN EGYPT. AT HALF TIME THERE WAS A RIOT. 74 FANS WERE KILLED. MANY BELIEVED IT WAS OH,  STRAIGHT OR AT LEAST ASSISTED OR  ENABLED BY THE POLICE. I CAME OUT AND YOU CALLED IT A  MASSACRE. THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT TO MAKE. YOU MARCHED WITH THE FAMILIES  AFTERWARDS. YOU HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE HEART  OF THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE. HOW WAS THE PHONE CAWLS WITH  PRESIDENT MORSI AFTER YOU SAID  THAT?
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT THE "M" WORD.
I DIDN'T HEAR FROM PRESIDENT  MORSI. I THINK HE KNEW I HAD BEEN ON  THE "DAILY SHOW" IN THE PAST. ( LAUGHTER ).
John: HOW ARE YOUR PLAYERS  HANDLING THIS SITUATION AT THE  MOMENT? THEY'RE IN A WEIRD EMOTIONAL  SPOT.
THE PLAYERS ARE AMAZING. THEY'VE BEEN RESILIENT. THE LEAGUE HAS SHUT DOWN AGAIN  SO THESE GUYS DON'T KNOW WHOSE  HAPPENING WITH THEIR YEARS. THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID. BUT STILL THERE'S THIS DREAM OF  GOING TO THE WORLD CUP THAT  DRIVES THEM, AND THEIR BELIEF KEEPS US GOING.
John: AFTER PORT SAID  COMELY WAS SHUT DOWN, WHICH YOUR  PLAYERS, PLAY IN, AND THE GAMES WERE IN EMPTY STADIUMS.
SO FOR A YEAR AND A DAY, THE  LEAGUE STOPPED AND IT FINALLY  GOT IS GOING AGAIN, AND WITH RECENT EVENTS IT'S BEEN SHUT  DOWN AGAIN.
John: HOW DOES IT FEEL FOR  A TEAM TO PLAY IN AN ARENA OF  86,000 EMPTY SEATS? THAT'S A WEIRD PSYCHOLOGICAL  JUMP FOR AN ATHLETE.
IT'S EERIE. YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING. BUT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING. BECAUSE THE GAME NEEDS FANS.
John: EXACTLY. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE  PLAYERS? IT'S AN EMOTIONAL SITUATION THAT  THEY'RE IN. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM?
THE FIRST TIME, I CAME UP  WITH SOMETHING GOOD. I SAID, "WE NEED TO LOOK INTO  THOSE STANDS AND SEE ALL 85  MILLION EGYPTIANS BECAUSE IF THEY HAD THE CHANCE THEY'D BE  HERE."  BUT YOU CAN ONLY GIVE THAT  SPEECH ONCE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
John: THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DID YOUR AL PACINO SPEECH  ONCE AND THEN WENT ( BLEEP ). GET OUT THEREOF, I'LL SLAP YOU  ON THE ARSE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE  FRNS AND THE RELEVANCE OF  FOOTBALL OR SO, EVERYDAY LIVES  HERE. THINKING HOW IN AMERICA IT'S  STILL SEEN AS A MINOR SPORT. THIS IS BEYOND SPORT ELSEWHERE. IN EGYPT IT'S HOURS AND HOURS OF  TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ABOUT THE  GAME EVERY NIGHT.
THEY LOVE THEIR FOOTBALL. YOU KNOW. AND THE TWO BIG TEAMS ARE ONCE  AGAIN DIVIDED. MOST PEOPLE CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE  TWO TEAMS. BUT THE ONLY THING EVERYBODY  STILL STANDS BEHIND IS THE  NATIONAL TEAM.
John: RIGHT. AND AT A TIME WHEN AMERICA IS  VIEWED IN EGYPT WITH SUCH  SUSPICION BY BOTH SIDES, REALLY, IT'S ALL ON YOU. ( LAUGHTER )  THE HOPE OF EGYPT AND THE  OPINION OF AMERICA IS ALL ON  YOUR HEAD.
EGYPTIANS DON'T REALLY HAVE A  PROBLEM WITH AMERICANS. IT'S MORE POLICY AND GOVERNMENT  AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF.
John: YOU CAN STICK AROUND  AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS  ON THE WEB BECAUSE IT'S AN AMAZING STORY.
I'D LOVE TO.
John: THAT WOULD BE GREAT. BOB BRADLEY, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, BOB BRA
