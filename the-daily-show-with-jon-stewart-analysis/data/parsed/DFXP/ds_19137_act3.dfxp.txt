Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACTRESS HER NEW SERIES FOR SUNDANCE TV IS CALLED "THE HONOURABLE WOMAN."
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO CHOOSE A PALESTINIAN. THEY WANT AN ISRAELI.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ANYONE WANTS, MR. MURAJI.
WE WANT YOU TO CHOOSE A PALESTINIAN. >>I WILL CHOOSE WHOEVER BEST PROTECTS THE AIMS AND IDEALS OF THIS COMPANY. AND NOTHING YOU OR ANYONE ELSE WANTS WILL AFFECT THAT DECISION.
YOU CANNOT CHOOSE AN ISRAELI, NOT AFTER THIS.
I'LL CHOOSE EXACTLY WHO I WANT.
THEN YOU WILL HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.
AND IF I DO, AT LEAST IT WILL BE MINE.
Jon: WELL, THAT SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING SUBJECT. ALL RIGHT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL. COME ON! LOOK AT YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?
SORRY. I'M SORRY. LET'S DO IT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SO WHEN DID YOU START FILMING THIS THING, THIS, THIS MINISERIES?
IN 2013.
Jon: 2013.
YEAH.
AND YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT TO YOU'RE, WELL, JEEZ WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS AND THEN PROBABLY BE OBSOLETE BECAUSE BY THE TIME IT COMES OUT, THIS WHOLE CONFLICT WILL BE SOLVED.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
Jon: AND PEOPLE WILL SEE IT AS A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT.
NO, NOT EXACTLY. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS A RELATIVELY QUIET TIME WHEN WE MADE IT, BUT RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY...
Jon: RIGHT. WHERE DID YOU MAKE IT?
WE MADE IT IN LONDON AND MOROCCO.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT WAS QUIETER. LONDON AND MOROCCO.
BUT 2013 WAS QUIET IN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE, TOO, QUIETER.
Jon: 20 YEARS. IT'S KINDA NOT QUIET.
NO, IT'S TRUE.
Jon: AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, YOU, YOU, YOU GIVE A SPEECH IN THE BEGINNING OF IT. YOUR CHARACTER GIVES A SPEECH ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINE. AND NO ONE SHOUTS YOU DOWN.
ARE PEOPLE GONNA POP UP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT?
Jon: NO, NO, NO. BUT NOBODY SHOUTED YOU DOWN. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND ARTISTIC LICENSE, BUT PUSHING FICTION THAT FAR I THINK REALLY CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. SO FAR ACTUALLY ABOUT THIS SHOW, AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS. AND I'VE WATCHED YOU SHOW. I KNOW IT'S BEEN COMPLICATED. AND I, I HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY PUSH BACK AT ME AND BE REALLY UPSET. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BUT I FEEL...
Jon: YOU HAVE VERY THOUGHTFUL FRIENDS.
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK THERE WILL BE MOMENTS IN IT WHEN PEOPLE THINK WE'VE GONE TOO FAR...
Jon: RIGHT.
TO ONE SIDE OR TOO FAR TO THE OTHER, BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY, YOU KNOW...
Jon: IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER AND DRAMATIZING THAT.
WELL, IT'S ABOUT LAYING OUT ASPECTS OF THE CONFLICT I THINK AND ASKING THE AUDIENCE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
Jon: UH-HUH.
AND SO FAR, ANYWAY, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, FOUR EPISODES HAVE PLAYED IN LONDON, AND ACTUALLY THE FOURTH EPISODE TAKES PLACE IN GAZA AND PLAYED LAST THURSDAY. AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS REALLY CURIOUS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AND HOW PEOPLE WOULD RESPOND. AND I THINK... I DON'T KNOW. SO FAR, I HOPE IT IS MAKING PEOPLE THINK AND FEEL. I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED TWITTER. I THINK IF YOU CHECK IT, I THINK YOU'LL SEE.
YEAH, I KNOW.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE CHARACTER, BECAUSE I'M ALMOST MORE INTERESTED IN, THOUGH, IN WHEN YOU'RE MAKING IT, BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS IS... WHEN YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES, IT'S ABOUT THE PARTICIPANTS, THE ACTORS, THE WRITERS, THE DIRECTOR DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES. I IMAGINE THERE WAS A WIDE VARIETY OF OPINION ON SET. HOW DID YOU FIND THAT THAT MANIFESTED ITSELF? AND WAS THAT AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION?
I MEAN, I MEAN, I THINK IN SOME WAYS THE WAY YOU'RE GOING IN IS THE RIGHT WAY. LIKE BASICALLY, WE MADE A PIECE OF ART. I CREATED A CHARACTER. I TRIED TO CREATE A CHARACTER THAT I HOPED WOULD SPEAK TO BOTH SIDES. NOW, MAYBE THAT'S A FANTASY. BUT I DO THINK IT'S A FANTASY THAT'S WORTH HAVING,
Jon: SURE.
THAT'S WORTH EXPLORING, THAT'S WORTH CONSIDERING. AND, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY NOW AT THIS MOMENT WHERE IT FEELS IMPOSSIBLE, WHERE IT'S REALLY SCARY TO TALK ABOUT, ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU KNOW, I THINK, I THINK ART CAN BE ONE WAY IN TO START TO THINK AND FEEL ABOUT THIS, NOT THAT IT'S GOING TO, YOU KNOW, SOLVE ANYTHING...
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT IF YOU CAN, IF YOU CAN SHIFT SOMEONE A LITTLE TINY BIT, IF THERE'S, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE A, IF IT'S TOO SCARY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S, PEOPLE GET SO ANGRY AND STOP LISTENING, MAYBE, MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN MAKE YOU FEEL ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES YOU THINK.
Jon: IS THAT WHEN YOU FIRST INVOLVE YOURSELF IN IT, IS THAT PART OF THE CALCULATION AND THE EQUATION? DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS, THIS... THIS IS A NICE, THIS IS A PARTICULARLY FRUITFUL AREA FOR ART TO DELVE INTO BECAUSE IT'S TOUCHING, YOU KNOW,  THE  MOST VOLATILE HEART, YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS ON THE PLANET.
THAT'S WHY I THINK HUGO, WHO IS THE DIRECTOR, WHO IS A GENIUS, IN MY OPINION, THAT'S WHY HE SET IT HERE ON SOME LEVEL BECAUSE THERE IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY ABOUT IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE IT IS THE HEART OF SOMETHING. AND IT, BUT FOR ME, TO BE HONEST, I GOT INVOLVED AND EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE THROUGH MAKING IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
I KNEW ABOUT AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW IF YOU KIND OF TRY READ THE NEWSPAPER, LIKE I DO. I DO MY BEST.
Jon: RIGHT.
I HAVE TWO LITTLE KIDS, AND I, YOU KNOW, I...
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT I, I NOW I AM COMPULSIVELY READING ABOUT IT.
Jon: RIGHT. TRY TO KEEP THE KIDS AWAY FROM THAT BECAUSE THAT, THAT IS A TOUGH ONE TO EXPLAIN.
THAT IS TRUE.
TO THE LITTLE ONES. WELL, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. NEXT TIME WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE A KIDS' ANIMATED SERIES? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A LITTLE?
SURE.
Jon: MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW...
I JUST CAME THE CHALLENGE YOU A LITTLE.
Jon: I KNOW. I LOVE IT VERY MUCH. "THE HONORABLE WOMAN" PREMIERES ON SUNDANCE TV THURSDAY JULY 31st AT 10:00 P.M., THE NEXT EPISODE, OR THE FIRST ONE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: YES. MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL, EVERYBODY.
