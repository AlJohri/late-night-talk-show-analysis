Jon: WELCOME BACK. SORRY. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, SHE'S GOT A NEW MOVIE OUT CALLED "LIFE AFTER BETH."
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A SPAZ.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO EXPLAIN.
YES.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME, BETH? YOU MADE ME THINK THAT YOU WERE...
HEY, HEY, HEY, ZACH SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL. THIS JUST HAPPENED.
WHAT JUST HAPPENED? WHAT DID I DO?
NOTHING HAPPENED. IT'S NORMAL.
EVERYTHING IS COMPLETELY NORMAL. YOU'RE TOTALLY FINE.
JUST TELL ME. JUST TELL ME. TELL ME WHY YOU SHUT ME OUT.
TELL YOU WHAT?
ZACH, WHY DON'T YOU AND I GO OUT AND HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION.
NO, MAURY. NO.
I THINK THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.
YOU LIED TO ME. >>NO,  I NEVER LIED.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WHY ARE YOU ACTING ALL WEIRD?
I'M NOT ACTING ALL WEIRD. STOP PLAYING DUMB, BETH.
I'M NOT PLAYING DUMB. YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.
ALL RIGHT, THAT IS NO WAY TO TALK TO MY DAUGHTER.
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE ALL CONFUSED.
LISTEN TO ME, ZACH, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN!
LOOK, THIS IS GOOD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. PLEASE WELCOME AUBREY PLAZA. [APPLAUSE] YEP, YEP, YEP. [APPLAUSE] YEP, YEP, YEP. THAT RIGHT THERE, THAT'S SOME HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING IN JOY
OKAY.
Jon: AND ANTICIPATION.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND I THINK YOUR ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE BACK WAS WELL TAKEN.
GLAD TO BE HERE.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
Jon: HOW IS... THIS IS... YOU ARE IN THIS MOVIE, IF I MAY, AND THIS IS...
YES, I AM.
Jon: I'M NOT TRYING TO GIVE THINGS AWAY. YOU ARE DEAD.
YES.
Jon: OKAY. BUT UNDEAD.
YES. I WILL EXPLAIN THE MOVIE.
Jon: PLEASE.
IN THE CLIP YOU JUST SAW, IT'S FIRST TIME THAT ZACH, WHO WAS MY BOYFRIEND WHEN I WAS ALIVE, SEES ME.
Jon: YEAH.
THE MOVIE STARTS OFF AND I'M DEAD. I'VE BEEN BITTEN BY A SNAKE. AND THEN I UNEXPECTEDLY COME BACK AND CHAOS ENSUES. AND, I SLOWLY THROUGHOUT THE FILM TURN INTO A ZOMBIE. SO I'VE BEEN... WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT A ZOM COM ROM DRAM. IT'S A NEW GENRE AND IT'S GONNA CHANGE EVERYTHING I THINK.
Jon:, NO I THINK IT WILL. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO CHANGE EVERYTHING.
OH, IT WILL.
Jon: YOUR, YOUR PARENTS, YOUR BOYFRIEND SEEMS TO BE WEARING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BLANKET UNDER HIS SHIRT.
YES. OUR COSTUME DESIGNER WAS DRUNK.
Jon: UH-HUH. OKAY.
EVERY DAY. SO IN EVERY SCENE THERE'S SOME WEIRD LITTLE THING LIKE THAT, AND THE CONTINUITY IS JUST OUT OF CONTROL.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW HOW CONTINUITY IS.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING? IN THE SECOND ACT OF THE SHOW HERE, I HAD MUTTON CHOPS. THERE'S NO REASON FOR THAT.
CRAZY.
Jon: WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
IT'S A CRAZY BUSINESS, JON.
Jon: YOU KNOW, AUBREY, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS A CRAZY BUSINESS. AND WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S ALL REALLY ABOUT.
WHAT IS THE POINT OF ANYTHING REALLY?
Jon: NOTHING.
WHY ARE WE HERE?
Jon: AUBREY, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE, BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE INTERVIEWING ME, BUT NOT ME, MY SOUL.
UM, YES, PLEASE.
Jon: WE'RE DOING AN IMPROV SCENE AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO KNOW IT. WE'RE HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME.
YEAH, ISN'T EVERY MOMENT IN LIFE AN IMPROV SCENE, JON?
Jon: CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING RIGHT NOW, AUBREY?
YEAH.
Jon: BA-BOOM. BA-BOOM, AND ALSO BA-BAM. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS FOR REALS. FOR REALS.
THANKS.
Jon: ARE YOU, ARE YOU ENJOYING NOW, NOW, YOU HAVE NOT HAD A BREAK. YOU'RE "PARKS AND REC" AND YOU'RE DOING ALL THESE MOVIES. WHEN ARE WE GETTING AUBREY TIME? WHEN ARE WE GETTING TIME FOR AUBREY TO RECONNECT WITH AUBREY?
AUBREY, AUBREY NO LIKE RECONNECT WITH AUBREY.
Jon: AUBREY SCARED OF AUBREY.
AUBREY LIKE WORK, A LOT.
YES.
WHEN I DON'T WORK, I SPIRAL INTO A DARK HOLE OF DEPRESSION, WHICH, I DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO TALK. THIS CROWD IS HERE FOR YOU.
OH. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: OH, LOOK AT THIS. DID WE ACTUALLY ZOOM IN CLOSER? YOU'RE THE FIRST GUEST THAT EVER ASKED FOR THIS. THIS THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER, TOO. I JUST TURNED 30.
Jon: ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU LOOK TREMENDOUS. WANT TO SEE SOMETHING SUPER SCARY IN THIS THING? WANT TO SEE HER GET -- NO, NO, NO. STAY ON THE CLOSE-UP. STAY ON THE CLOSE-UP. THIS IS AUBREY PLAZA BEING SWALLOWED UP BY A NOSTRIL. IN THAT CLOSE-UP.
THAT'S GREAT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I WAS IN YOUR CLOSE-UP THERE.
THAT'S OKAY.
Jon: DOES IT, IS IT BETTER? I HAVE FOUND, AS WELL, THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY YOU NEED TO RELAX AND TAKE SOME TIME.
YEAH.
Jon: BUT I ALWAYS FIND THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A VERY SMALL WINDOW BETWEEN, WOW, IT'S SO GOOD TO JUST BE WITH MY THOUGHTS AGAIN, TO YOU FAILED EVERYONE THAT EVER LOVED YOU. LIKE THAT...
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: THAT IS A VERY SHORT WINDOW.
YEAH, I LIVE IN A CONSTANT STATE OF REGRET, AND AND I'M JUST REPLAYING ALL THE FAILURES IN MY LIFE. AND WHEN I'M WORKING, I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY.
Jon: RIGHT. PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND THEY TOUCH ME A LOT. I GOT A LOT OF PHYSICAL CONTACT, AND I LIKE THAT.
Jon: YOU'RE LIKE A SIMS CHARACTER TO SOME EXTENT.
YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: WELL, I LOVE IT. THE MOVIE IS INCREDIBLY ENTERTAINING, AS ARE YOU. WE CAN SHAKE NOW OR WE CAN DO IT LATER OR WE COULD ARM WRESTLE.
OR WE COULD MAKE A BABY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: "LIFE AFTER BETH," CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON DirecTV. IT'S IN THE THEATERS ON AUGUST 15th. IT'S AUBREY PLAZA.
