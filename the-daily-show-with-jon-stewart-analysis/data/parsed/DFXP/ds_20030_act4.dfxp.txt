Jon: HEY, THAT'S OUR SHOW. BUT BEFORE WE GO I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING REALLY QUICK. BEFORE YOU GO YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WATCHING ME TALK TO SOPHIE DELAUNAY AND YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING TO YOURSELF, MAN, I WISH JON STEWART WOULD INTERVIEW ME. I WILL NEVER BE THE HEAD OF A GLOBAL MEDICAL CHARITY OR A SAINT THAT WALKS AMONG US. WELL GUESS WHAT, NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. HERE'S WHAT I SUGGEST. GO TO THE WEBSITE AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT SCREEN THERE AND DONATE TO "THE MISSION CONTINUES." IT'S AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION. IT BRINGS RETURNING VETERANS HOME AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP SERVING THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THESE NEW TRAINING PLATOONS. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PROGRAMS AND CHARITIES I'VE EVER SEEN. ANY TEN DOLLAR DONATION ENTERS YOU INTO A RAFFLE FOR A CHANCE TO WIN A INTERVIEW WITH THIS IDIOT ALONG WITH A FREE FLIGHT TO NEW YORK AND A STAY AT WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, ONE OF THEM 4 STAR HOTELS AND ALL OF THE FILMS YOU CAN RENT. THAT PART NOT TRUE. THE FIRST QUESTION WHEN I INTERVIEW WITH YOU? PROBABLY ABOUT HOW AWESOME YOU ARE. GO TO THE WEBSITE. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
THE MOST COMMONLY CITED EXAMPLE IS THE GRASS MUD HORSE. THREE CHINESE CHARACTERS WHICH MEAN EITHER A MYTHICAL ALPACA LIKE CREATURE OR UNPRINTABLE OBSCENITY ABOUT MOTHERS.
