Jon: WOW!  WOW!  WELCOME BACK!  I'M SORRY. I AM EXHAUSTED. I JUST GAVE MYSELF A LAP DANCE. IT IS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS. AS YOU MAY KNOW, LAST WEEK BEFORE WE GOT TO TAMPA, THERE WAS A BIT OF AN UPROAR CAUSE BID  THE REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE IN THE GREAT STATE OF MISSOURI, AN INTERESTING POSITION ON THE QUESTION OF PREGNANCIES RESULTING FROM RAPE.
FIRST OF ALL, AT THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM DOCTORS THAT IS REALLY RARE, IF IT IS A  LEGITIMATE RAPE, THE FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS TO TRY TO SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN.
Jon: STOP IT. THAT IS SCIENCE.
IT IS SO TRUE, THE FEMALE BODY IS AMAZING. DID YOU KNOW THAT THE HUMAN VAGINA -- BESIDES BEING ABLE TO REPEL RAPE SPERM IS ALSO, CAN BE  USED AS A WIFI HOT SPOT. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, CAN DETECT RADON AND CARBON MONOXIDE KNOCKS SIDE. AND CONVERT STANDARD DVDS TO BLU-RAYS AND .. IF YOU ARE IN A CAR CHASE, CAN SHOOT OUT TACKS  OR AN OIL SLICK. TO THROW OFF YOUR PURSUERS. THE VAGINA. THE MORE YOU KNOW. SO YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS REMARK -- YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS REMARK COMING FROM A MAN WHO SITS ON  THE HOUSE SCIENCE COMMITTEE CAN BE QUITE A STORY. BUT GUESS WHAT THE REAL STORY IS?
WITH THE MEDIA REFUSING TO LET THIS STORY GO, HOW DOES THE MITT ROMNEY CAMPAIGN GET HIS  MESSAGES OUT THERE?
THE MEDIA HAVE A REPUBLICAN IN THEIR CROSS HAIRS.
LIBERAL MEDIA WON'T TALK ABOUT NOTHING ELSE.
LAST NIGHT HE SENT OUT A SERIES OF TWEETS, HE SAID AND I QUOTE, I APOLOGIZE FOR THE  LIBERAL MEDIA IS TRYING TO MAKE ME DROP OUT.
Jon: OH!  IF ONLY THAT POOR MAN HAD ONE OF THOSE MAGIC VAGINAS TO PROTECT HIM. HE COULD HAVE REPELLED THE MEDIA!  WHY WOULD THE MEDIA PILE ON THIS POOR MAN LIKE THIS?
THE MEDIA HAS A LOVE AFFAIR WITH BARACK OBAMA AND THE PRESS OFFICE OF THE OBAMA REELECTION  CAMPAIGN, KNOWN AS NBC NEWS. YOU WATCH ALL OF THOSE COMEDY CENTRAL SHOWS, THEY ARE IN THE TANK FOR BARACK OBAMA.
Jon: WHAT?  WORK HOLICS AND THE NEW SERIES FICKLE BERRY PREMIERING SEPTEMBER 25TH ARE IN  THE TANK FOR OBAMA?  I CAN'T --
OH!
Jon: COLBERT!  ..
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY IS IN THE TANK. LOOK, I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE TANK. THE TANK IS WHERE FISH POOP IS. I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THERE. I JUST WANT TO HAVE A FAIR CONVERSATION ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SEEM RELEVANT TO  THIS ELECTION. THE ISSUE, ROMNEY IS RUNNING ON HIS BUSINESS EXPERIENCE. LET'S TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE IN BAIN CAPITAL.
GOING AFTER MITT ROMNEY'S RECORD AS A BUSINESSMAN ARE NOT  THINGS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH.
Jon: THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HIS BUSINESS RECORD, THAT'S FINE. ALTHOUGH HERE IS A PROBLEM IF WE ONLY TALK ABOUT THINGS AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH THEN  THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN WOULD BE ABOUT HOARDERS AND TODDLER BEAUTY PAGEANTS.
Jon: LOOK, MITT ROMNEY, I GET IT, ALL YOU ARE ASKING IS FOR YOU TO MAKE YOU THE MOST, THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL HUMAN BEING, WHAT ELSE SHOULD WE NOT TALK ABOUT.
BUSINESS OR FAMILY OR TAXES, THINGS OF THIS NATURE, THIS IS -- A DIVERSION.
Jon: I SEE. SO WHILE TYPICALLY THOSE WOULD BE THE THREE CRITERION THAT ARE EXAMINED, JOB INTERVIEW FOR THE  PRESIDENCY, BUT, ALL RIGHT, PERHAPS YOU WOULD PREFER TO STICK TO SOME BASIC HEIGHT AND WEIGHT, SQUARENESS OF JAW LINE, YOU KNOW, JC PENNEY MODEL CRITERIA, WE ALREADY KNOW YOU WON'T GIVE SPECIFICS ON WHICH  PROGRAMS YOU CUT.  I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE TANK, BUT WOULD YOU LIKE TO VOLUNTEER SOME  INFORMATION FOR US?
TELL US SOMETHING THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE GOVERNOR.
WELL, I THINK PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE ACTUALLY HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.
IS SHE RIGHT?
YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I LIVE FOR LAUGHTER.
Jon: NOW, WE ARE COOKING. NOW WE GOT SOMETHING. I TOO -- ALL RIGHT. HIT ME WITH SOME OF YOUR BEST STUFF.
NO ONE EVER ASKED TO SEE MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE. THEY KNOW THIS IS THE PLACE WE WERE BORN AND RAISED.
Jon: HE WAS BORN IN AMERICA, IN MICHIGAN. HE NEVER HAS BEEN -- OH. I GOT A BETTER ONE ABOUT MICHIGAN. WHY DOES MICHIGAN MAKE SO MANY CARS. SO THEY CAN GET THE (BLEEP) OUT OF MICHIGA
