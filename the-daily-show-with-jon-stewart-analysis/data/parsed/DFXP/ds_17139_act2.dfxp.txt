(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A VERY TALENTED YOUNG ACTOR WHO WE ARE NOT GOING TO BRING OUT JUST YET  BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS DEMAND ON TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA FOR MORE VICE PRESIDENT JOKES. AS WE'VE SEEN, MITT ROMNEY'S CHOICE OF PAUL RYAN FOR HIS RUNNING MATE HAS THRILLED REPUBLICANS. DEMOCRATS PROBABLY ARE FEELING RATHER DIFFERENT EMOTIONS
DEMOCRATS SEEM AS EXCITED ABOUT THE PICK OF RYAN AS REPUBLICANS
AS A DEMOCRAT I'M EXCITED TODAY. PUTTING PAUL RYAN ON THE PRESIDENTIAL TICKET IS A DISASTER FOR MITT ROMNEY'S CAMPAIGN
I DID TALK TO THE HOUSE DEMOCRAT CAMPAIGN ARM YESTERDAY. THE MAN WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE RYAN PICK
HE IS A RIGHT WING IDEOLOGUE I HAVE HEARD VERY FEW BAD THIMTION AS A HUMAN BEING OTHER  THAN HIS VIEWS.
Jon: MY GOD. WITH ONE CHOICE, MITT ROMNEY HAS DONE WHAT OBAMA COULDN'T DO IN THREE-AND-A-HALF YEARS: UNITE  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY AL MADRIGAL REPRESENTING TEAM RYAN AND FROM THE DEMOCRATIC  VIEWPOINT JESSICA WILLIAMS REPRESENTING TEAM RYAN
THAT'S RIGHT, JOHN. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT PAUL RYAN
AND I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT PAUL RYAN AS WELL.
Jon: HOW CAN BOTH SIDES BE BOTH EQUALLY EXCITED?
JON, THIS IS A HARD LINE FISCAL CONSERVATIVE WHO WILL SLASH THE FEDERAL BUDGET TO THE  BONE (BOTH SPEAKING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME)
Jon: YOU KNOW YOU BOTH SAID THE EXACT SAME THING JUST WITH DIFFERENT INTONATIONS
WHAT? NO.
I DON'T REALIZE THAT. Jon: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET YOUR MESSAGE ABOUT PAUL RYAN ACROSS?
WELL, NOW THAT THE CHOICE IS SOLIDIFIED, WE'RE OUT WITH A GREAT NEW A. P. CHECK IT OUT.
PAUL RYAN WANTS TO CUT $700 BILLION OUT OF MEDICARE AND HIS  TAX PLAN WOULD CUT TOP TAXES TO 1%. PAUL RYAN, THE CHANGE AMERICA WANTS. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
WELL, OBVIOUSLY THAT'S REPUBLICAN TALKING POINTS. THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T YET KNOW ABOUT PAUL RYAN BUT SHOULD.
PAUL RYAN WANTS TO CUT $700 BILLION OUT OF MEDICARE (SCREAMING) AND HIS TAX PLAN  WOULD CUT TOP TAX RATES TO 1%. PAUL RYAN, THE CHANGE AMERICA WANTS?
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: THANK YOU. JESSICA WILLIAMS AND AL MADRIGAL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RI
