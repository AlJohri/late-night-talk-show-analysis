Stewart: WELCOME TO THE  SHOW!
I WAS VERY MUCH HOPING, THAT  A BIG STORY WOULD BREAK DURING  THE COMMERCIAL SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SYRIA BUT  THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. OBVIOUSLY IT IS A DARK STORY BUT  WE DO HERE A MAGIC COMEDY SHOW. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT  SO YOU KNOW WHAT?  HERE WE GO.
I AM JOHNNY STEW'S GOOD TIME  SYRIA JAMBOREE!
REMINDS ME OF A YOKE. SO SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR AND SYRIA  WALK INTO A BAR CALLED AMERICA  IS NOT PLANNING ON BOMBING YOU T-BAR TENDER SAYS, I DON'T THINK  YOU SHOULD BE IN HERE, SYRIA. AFTER CAREFUL DELIBERATION I  HAVE DECIDED THAT UNITED STATES  SHOULD TAKE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIAN REGIME TARGETS.
Stewart: WOW, AMERICA  TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST  THE MIDDLE EAST REGIME. IT IS LIKE I NEVER LEFT. SO WHAT BROUGHT THE PRESIDENT TO  THIS DECISION.
50 TONS OF MUSTARD GAS IN A  TURKEY FARM.
Stewart: ACTUALLY THAT IS  THE WRONG PRESIDENT, THE WRONG  PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
LEAVE KUWAIT OR BE DRIVEN  OUT.
Stewart: OKAY. THAT IS THE SAME COUNTRY, AND  FAMILY, BUT IT IS A SLIGHTLY  DIFFERENT WAR.
TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR  INDEPENDENCE DAY!
Stewart: THAT WAS A  FICTIONAL PRESIDENT AND TO BE  FAIR, THAT WAR WAS PRETTY  JUSTIFIED!
THEY HAVE EVIDENCE THAT  CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE USED IN  THAT ATTACK IN SYRIA TWO WEEKS  AGO.
BLOOD AND HAIR SAMPLES THAT  HAVE COME TO US, HAVE TESTED  POSITIVE FOR SIGNATURES OF  SARIN.
Stewart: THAT'S THE ONE,  THAT'S THE ONE!  WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT SIGNATURES OF SARIN, YEAH.
I ASSUME THAT IS DIFFERENT  FROM THE NEW FRAGRANCE OF THE  SAME NAME. SIGNATURES OF SARIN. BECAUSE LOVE IS BLIND NOW.
CAME BACK TO THE, CAME BACK  TO A DARK, DARK PLACE. NOW IF MEMORY SERVES, 100,000  SYRIANS HAVE ALREADY DIED DURING  THE CONFLICT WITH PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD, ALREADY WITH NO  MILITARY INTERVENTION,  INTERVENTION FROM THE WEST, SO WHY NOW?
DAILY SHOW FLASHBACK CLIP TO  AUGUST 2012.
WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR TO  THE ASSAD REGIME BUT ALSO TO  OTHER PLAYERS ON THE GROUND THAT A RED LINE FOR US IS WE START  SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF CHEMICAL  WEAPONS MOVING AROUND OR BEING  UTILIZED.
Stewart: YOU CAN'T USE  CHEMICALS TO USE YOUR OWN  PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO DO IT ORGANICALLY. AMERICA AND THE WORLD WANTS THAT  YOU ONLY USE LOCALLY HOMEGROWN  ORDINANCE. NOW BACK IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES  WHEN IRAQ USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS  AGAINST IRAN AND NOT ONLY DID WE NOT ATTACK THEM WE SUPPORTED  IRAQ AND STILL RESERVE THE RIGHT  TO USE THE CLUSTER BOMBS AND MARK 77 WHICH IS NOT, NOT FILLED  WITH NAPALM, TECHNICALLY.
SO DUO THE FACT WE HAVE NO  IDEA WHO WOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER  THESE CHEMICAL WEAPONS, REMIND US AGAIN WHY WE HAVE TO DO THIS?
THE DANGER IS THE MORE  RELUCTANT YOU ARE AND THE MORE  DELIBERATIVE YOU ARE, THE DANGER IS YOU CAN START LOOKING WEAK.
IF THEY SENSE THAT STRENGTH  IS NOT THERE, THAT WEAKNESS HAS  REPLACED IT THEN THEY GO THEIR OWN WAY.
BULLIES AND TYRANTS DON'T  RESPECT WEAKNESS.
Stewart: SO WE HAVE TO BOMB  SYRIA BECAUSE WE ARE IN SEVENTH  GRADE!  AND THE RED LINE -- THE RED LINE THAT THEY CROSSED IS  ACTUALLY A DICK MEASURING  RIBBON. WHY DOES HOLDING BACK LOOK LIKE  WEAKNESS?  DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE  MATURITY. LIKE THE GUY PICKING ON CLARK  KENT DOESN'T REACT ALTHOUGH HE  COULD THROW THE GUY INTO THE  SUN.
THIS IS WHAT IS REAL  WEAKNESS, CLARK KENT LAYING  WASTE TO A TOWN BECAUSE SOMEONE CALLED HIM A PUSSY. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS WEAKNESS  ASKING THE ADVICE FROM A PARADE  OF EXPERTS THAT GOT IT WRONG ON IRAQ OR AS IS KNOWN IN CABLE,  EXPERTS.
I HOPE HE ACTS IN SYRIA, I  HOPE HE ACTS IN A MUCH MORE  VIGOROUS AND ROBUST SENSE.
THE IDEA OF DEMYSTIFYING WHAT  YOU ARE GOING TO DO FOR THE  ENEMY IS MINDLESS. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THEY ARE  THINKING.
I WISH WE HAD INTERVENED AND  HE COULD HAVE INTERVENED A YEAR  AGO TWO, YEARS AGO.
Stewart: HEY, EVERYBODY,  THE IDIOT PARADE IS IN TOWN!
SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP!  SHUT  THE (BLEEP) UP!  SHUT THE  (BLEEP) UP!  SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP!  SHUT THE (BLEEP) UP!  SHUT  THE (BLEEP) UP!
SCHUPP THE (BLEEP) UP!
Stewart: JUST WROTE THAT  SONG TODAY. ALL RIGHT. ASSAD HAS CROSSED THE LINE OF  WHAT WE PEEL IS THE APPROPRIATE  WAY TO KILL PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE TO SEND POWERFUL  MESSAGE TO THE WORLD. CHEMICAL WEAPONS WILL NOT BE  TOLERATED.
WE WOULD NOT PUT BOOTS ON THE  GROUND. INSTEAD OUR ACTION WOULD BE  DESIGNED TO BE LIMITED IN  DURATION AND SCOPE.
Stewart: YOU ARE SAYING THE  ONLY WAY TO KEEP AMERICA'S PENIS  FROM LOOKING SMALL IS TO TAKE A SOMEWHAT INEFFECTIVE ACTION  PURPOSEFULLY DESIGNED TO  ACCOMPLISH VERY LITTLE. WE WILL CALL IT OPERATION JUST  THE TIP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: BY THE WAY,  OPERATION JUST THE TIP ONE OF  MILTON BRADLEY'S LEAST POPULAR  GAMES.
YOU BUTT IN THE SHAFT!   PRETTY SNEAKY!
WE WILL BE RIGHT
