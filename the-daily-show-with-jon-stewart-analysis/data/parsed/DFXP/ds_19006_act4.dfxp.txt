WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO YOU TALK. WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BOOK I AM MALALA. IT'S ON BOOKSHELVES RIGHT NOW. YOUR LOVE OF SCHOOL REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF MY CHILDREN. OKAY. MAYBE NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE PEOPLE OF SWAT VALLEY WHEN THE TALIB FIRST CAME, THEY THOUGHT, THEY ARE BRINGING ORDER. THEY ARE BRINGING SERVICES. THEY ESTABLISHED A COURT THAT WAS FASTER THAN PAKISTANI COURTS.
YES.
Jon: AND THE PEOPLE RESPONDED. WHEN DID THAT BEGIN TO TURN?
WHEN THE TALIBAN CAME, THEY WERE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE AND THEY WERE JUST MISUSING THE NAME OF ISLAM. THEY WERE TELLING PEOPLE WE WILL SET UP ANOTHER COURT FOR YOU AND PROVIDE YOU JUSTICE ON TIME. USUALLY COURTS IN PAKISTAN, PEOPLE DIE AND THEIR CASE IS NOT YET RESOLVED IN THE COURT. BUT THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COURTS OF PAKISTAN. SO PEOPLE JUST SAID IF THE TALIBAN ARE DOING IT, WHY DON'T WE SUPPORT THEM. THEN THEY WERE THAT MUCH CRUELER WHEN THEY STARTED SLAUGHTERING PEOPLE. THEY EVEN BLASTED A GENERATOR OF ELECTRICITY. AND IT WAS THE MOVE RAMADAN IN WHICH WE DON'T EAT ON THE DAY. IN WHICH WE DON'T DRINK FOR THE WHOLE DAY. THEY BLASTED ELECTRICITY GENERATORS PROVIDING ELECTRICITY TO THE WHOLE CITY. WE CANNOT HAVE WATER BECAUSE ELECTRICITY IS RELATED TO WATER SUPPLY AS WELL. PEOPLE WERE SITTING IN THE DARK. PEOPLE COULD NOT BUY ELECTRICITY GENERATORS. PEOPLE WERE SITTING IN THE LIGHT OF CANDLES AND PEOPLE WERE JUST DYING OF THIRST AT THE TIME. MY FATHER IS A GREAT FATHER BECAUSE HE BOUGHT GENERATOR FOR THE SCHOOL TO CREATE ELECTRICITY AND PROVIDE WATER TO THE STREET AND THAT COMMUNITY. BUT STILL MANY PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING FROM THE HARD SITUATION. AND OTHER THAN THAT, OUR FREEDOM WAS TAKEN FROM US.
Jon: YES.
THE WOMEN'S FREEDOM. WE COULD NOT GO TO MARKET. WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL. WE WERE JUST KEPT IMPRISONED. WE WERE LIMITED TO THE FOUR WALLS OF OUR HOUSE. WOMENS' RIGHTS WERE DENIED AT THAT TIME AND THAT'S WHY I SPOKE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN EQUALITY AND I BELIEVE THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. I EVEN BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN IS MORE POWERFUL THAN MAN.
Jon: WHAT, WHOA WHAT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHOA! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, MALALA, THIS WAS GOING SO WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU WERE DOING SO BEAUTIFULLY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN SUDDENLY BAM! [LAUGHTER] IT'S -- THIS IS THE PART THAT THEY BEGAN TO SAY YOU CANNOT DANCE.
YES.
Jon: YOU CANNOT -- THE WOMEN CANNOT DO THESE THINGS. YOU SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS IS A WRONG INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM, OF THE KORAN. DO YOU -- WHY HAVE THE TALIBAN AND THESE MORE EXTREME GROUPS BEEN ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL? IS IT THE FEAR THAT THEY BRING TO THESE TOWNS? DO THEY -- IS THAT WHY THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD A HARD TIME THROWING IT OFF?
THE FIRST THING IS THAT THEY WERE REALLY CRUEL. THEY HAD GUNS IN THEIR HANDS. IF I HAVE A GUN IN MY HAND AND I TELL YOU SOMETHING DO THIS, YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S FOR YOUR LIFE. SO THERE WAS FEAR ALL AROUND. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COULD NOT SAY ANYTHING. THEN THE SECOND THING THAT THEY WERE MISUSING THE NAME OF ISLAM. THEY WERE TELLING PEOPLE THEY ARE DOING THIS FOR ISLAM. THEY ARE DOING THIS FOR ALLAH AND THE PROPHET PEACE BE UPON HIM. THEY WERE USING RELIGION FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL BENEFITS. THIS IS ALSO THE REASON. BUT THEN LATER ON PEOPLE TRY TO REALIZE THIS AND THE GIRLS ARE VERY BRAVE. GIRLS IN OUR SCHOOL. AT THAT TIME WE WERE JUST 11 OR 12 YEARS OLD BUT WE SPOKE OF OUR RIGHTS TO EVERY MEDIA CHANNEL AND NEWSPAPER WE COULD. WE DO NOT KNOW AT THIS TIME THAT OUR SMALL INTERVIEW WOULD HAVEAT AN IMPACT BUT IT HAD BECAUSE WE WERE RAISING UP OUR VOICE AND SPEAKING UP FOR OUR RIGHTS. AND WE WERE SPEAKING FOR PEACE. WE WANTED TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A PARADISE. I BELIEVE IN TWO PARADISES: ONE I GET AFTER DEATH AND ONE I GET ON EARTH BECAUSE SWAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND YOU WOULD BE ASTONISHED WHEN YOU SEE THE LUSH ASTOGREEN HILLS AND THE TALLLUSH MOUNTAIN AND CRYSTAL CLEAR WATER. IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL. YOU WOULD LOVE SWAT.
Jon: MALALA, I'M FROM NEW JERSEY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- SO I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT PARADISE. IT DOES -- IT SOUNDS MAGNIFICENT AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE YOU SEE WHAT THESE CHILDREN WANT AND WHAT THESE PEOPLE WANT IS TO JUST LIVE IN PEACE WITHOUT HAVING THIS IMPOSED ON THEM. AND I THINK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO HELP, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PASSAGES IN THE BOOK ABOUT THE UNITED STATES. AND WE COME OUT GREAT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THERE IS -- YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ATTACKS IN SWAT AND IN THOSE AREAS, DRONES, AND THEY TALK ABOUT A MAN A C.I.A. AGENT WHO SHOT TWO MEN IN LAHORE. ABOUT A MAN A C.I.A. AGENT WHO SHOT TWO MEN IN LAHORE. WE HAVE A COMMON WANT AND DESIRE BUT PERHAPS ARE NOT ACCOMPLISHING IT IN THE MANNER THAT SHOWS THE PEOPLE HOW WE FEEL BUT IN SOME WAYS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT?
I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA, THE UNITED STATES, THEY TRULY SUPPORT PEACE AND THEY SAY THAT WE MUST NOT FIGHT AGAINST WAR THROUGH WAR. THEY BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS THE BEST WAY. WE MUST TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR IT. IN MY OPINION, THE SOLUTION THAT WOULD WORK TO FIGHT ALL THESE WARS AND ALL THESE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING IS ONLY EDUCATION. BECAUSE YOU CAN STOP WAR FOR A SECOND BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IT WILL START AGAIN OR NOT. WE'VE SEEN FIRST WORLD WAR, SECOND WORLD WAR AND I THINK THIRD WORLD WAR IS COMING BUT I BELIEVE WE MUST STOP IT NOW. I DON'T WANT TO SEE A THIRD WORLD WAR IN THIS WORLD AGAIN. THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS WAR IS EDUCATION. BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE THE CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING FROM THE TERRORISM. THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM CHILD LABOR AND CHILD TRAFFICKING. THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM THE CULTURE TRADITIONS. THERE'S NOT ONLY ONE ISSUE WE ARE FACING, TOO. MANY OTHERS AS WELL. EDUCATION IS THE BEST WAY. PEOPLE ARE THINKING DOES GOING TO SCHOOL, LEARNING CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS AND MATH. AND THAT'S IT. GOING TO SCHOOL IS NOT ONLY LEARNING ABOUT DIFFERENT SUBJECTS IT TEACHES YOU COMMUNICATION, IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO LIVE A LIFE. IT TEACHES YOU ABOUT HISTORY AND HOW SCIENCE IS WORKING AND OTHER THAN THAT YOU LEARN ABOUT EQUALITY BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE PROVIDING THE SAME -- IT TEACHES STUDENTS HOW TO LIVE WITH OTHERS TOGETHER HOW TO ACCEPT EACH OF THE LANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS AND EACH OF THEIR RELIGIONS. IT ALSO TEACHES US JUSTICE. IT ALSO TEACHES US RESPECT. IT TEACHES US HOW TO LIVE TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THE -- I SUPPORT THE IDEA OF SENDING CHILDREN TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT TERRORISM. AND I WANT PEOPLE TO SUPPORT US IN THIS CAUSE AND THROUGH THEUS MALALA FOUNDATION WE WANT TO OFFER EDUCATION OF GIRLS IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY IN SYRIA NOW. THEY ARE SUFFERING. THEY ARE HOMELESS NOW. WE WANT TO HELP CHILDREN IN AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SUFFERING FROM TERRORISM FOR DECADES. WE WANT TO HELP THE CHILDREN OF INDIA AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE VICTIMS OF CHILD LABOR. I THINK THERE ARE THINGS AND THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE. EDUCATION. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: I AM HUMBLED, HUMBLED SO SPEAK WITH YOU. I WILL SAY THIS:  I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM BUT I AM VERY GLAD YOU ARE HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. PLEASE. GET THE BOOK. DONATE TO THE MALALA FOUND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
