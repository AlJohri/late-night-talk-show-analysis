(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO HEALTH CARE IS NOT THE ONLY LIFE-AND-DEATH ISSUE THAT HAS AMERICA DEEPLY DIVIDED.
65% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF FENDING OFF  ALIEN INVASION THAN WOULD MITT ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PERHAPS MR. ROMNEY DOES NOT WANT TO FIGHT HIS OWN KIND. (LAUGHTER) BUT I BELIEVE A FICTIONAL SCENARIO DESERVES A FICTIONAL PRESIDENT, QUITE FRANKLY. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT FRICTIONAL PRESIDENT IS NEITHER OBAMA NOR ROMNEY BUT HERMAN CAIN.
ARE YOU PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. EARTH IS BEING ATTACKED BY ALIENS. LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA. AND ACTION.
CITIZENS OF EARTH, IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT BUILT THIS PLANET. IT IS THAT SAME SPIRIT OF HUMANITY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DESTROY THE ALIENS. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT WAS AWESOME. (LAUGHTER) AND MR. CAIN GAVE THAT SPEECH OFF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. TRUE. SO WHEN HERMAN CAIN ENDED HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN AN ALIEN INVASION WAS NOT 9 ONLY MOMENT OF CRISIS WE  LOST A CHANCE TO SEE HIM RESPOND TO. MANY, MANY OTHERS. THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF A NEW SERIES, A NEW SERIES OF JOHN OLIVER'S INTERVIEWS, HERMAN CAIN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENCY.
IN OCTOBER OF 2011 HERMAN CAIN LEAD THE POLLS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. TRAGICALLY AMERICA WAS DENIED A HOME IN CAIN'S PRESIDENCY BUT RECENTLY I  SAT DOWN WITH MR. CAIN FOR A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE TOUGH  DECISIONS WE HAVE FACED IN OFFICE. I PRESENT TO YOU HERMAN CAIN, AN AMERICAN PRESIDENCY. TONIGHT THE CONSTITUTION.
I LOVE THE CONSTITUTION AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE BIBLE.
HANDS DOWN, THE BIBLE.
THE BIBLE WOULD BEAT THE CONSTITUTION.
YES. NO QUESTION, IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE A CONTEST.
REALLY, THE CONSTITUTION WOULDN'T EVEN GET IN A COUPLE OF BLOWS JUST BY LAW  OF AVERAGES.
NO.
WOULD THE BIBLE KNOW WHEN TO STOP PUNCHING OR WOULD HE HAVE TO PULL IT OFF.
THE BIBLE WOULD KNOW WHEN TO STOP.
WHAT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION, SIR?
I WOULD BE WILLING TO USE MY POWER AS PRESIDENT TO CALL OUR MILITARY INTO  ACTION IF NECESSARY.
WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO KILL FOR IT, SIR.
YES, I WOULD.
THE CRISIS. OKAY, SIR. REPORTS ARE COMING IN THAT NICHOLAS CAGE HAS BROKEN INTO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND HAS STOLEN THE  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA, AND CONVINCE NICHOLAS CAGE TO GIVE THAT CONSTITUTION BACK.
NICHOLAS, BRING BACK OUR CONSTITUTION. I RESPECT YOU, CAGE, BUT GET A GRIP. I HAVE INSTRUCTED THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, THE FBI, THE CIA TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO BRING THAT CONSTITUTION BACK.
OKAY, SIR, I HAVE AN UPDATE. GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS. WHICH DO YOU WANT FIRST.
LET'S START WITH THE GOOD NEWS.
GOOD NEWS IS YOU GOT HIM. CONGRATULATIONS, SIR.
WE GOT HIM.
DOW WANT THE BAD NEWS IT?
YES.
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE CONSTITUTION, SIR.
HE DIDN'T HAVE IT.
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE CONSTITUTION?
NO, HE DIDN'T HAVE IT.
SO YOU NOW HAVE TO ADDRESS NICHOLAS CAGE FANS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND  EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY YOU KILLED THEIR FAVORITE ACTOR, THREE, TWO, ONE, GO.
MY BAD. (LAUGHTER)
NEXT TIME ON HERMAN CAIN, AN AMERICAN PRESIDENCY, A DIFFERENT CRISIS.
AMERICA WILL NOT NEGOTIATE WITH MOON NAZIS.
