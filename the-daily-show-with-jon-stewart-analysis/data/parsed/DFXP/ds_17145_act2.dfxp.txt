Jon: RIGHT BEFORE MITT ROMNEY'S SUCCESSION SPEECH CONVENTIONEERS WILL AS ALWAYS BE  EXPOSED I MEAN TREATED TO A BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL FILM ABOUT THE NOMINEE. YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT, LUCKILY WE HAVE RECEIVED IT, RECEIVED AN ADVANCED COPY OF SAID FILM AND AS A PUBLIC SERVICE WE WOULD LIKE TO SHOW  YOU MITT ROMNEY'S BIOGRAPHICAL FILM SHOWN AT THE CONVENTION.
THIS YEAR, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FACE A CHOICE BETWEEN A SELF-MADE BUSINESSMAN.
I KNOW HOW EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT IT IS TO BUILD SOMETHING FROM NOTHING.
AND A RADICAL COLLECTIVIST WHO SAYS THINGS LIKE.
IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS YOU DIDN'T BUILD THIS.
I WAS NOT BORN IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND THE LEADER OF AL QAEDA.
THIS IS THE STORY OF MITT ROMNEY, A HUMAN BEING WHO BUILT THAT.
GEORGE W ROMNEY WAS A WELL WITH THINK AUTO EXECUTIVE AND FUTURE MICHIGAN GOVERNOR, BUT  BEING BORN HIS SON WAS ANYTHING BUT LUCK. LITTLE MITT ROMNEY WON THE COVETED POSITION ONLY BY OUTCOMPETING THOUSANDS OF LESS MOTIVATED SPERM. AND THOUGH WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER THE ROMNEY FAMILY WAS FOR A TIME FORCED TO TAKE  SHELTER IN PUBLIC HOUSING, YOUNG MITT REFUSED ON PRINCE BILLION TO TAKE TAXPAYER MONEY FOR HIS  SCHOOLING, INSTEAD CONVINCE AGO LOCAL BUSINESSMAN TO INVEST IN HIS FUTURE. AND THEN THE VIETNAM. ROMNEY VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE IN FRANCE. A MORMON MISSIONARY BRAVELY FIGHTING THE FRENCH PEOPLE'S LOVE OF WINE.
IT WAS A QUAGMIRE. SOMETIMES AT NIGHT HE FEELS HE IS STILL THERE.
BACK STATESIDE, THE HANDSOME CONNECTED YOUNG MAN BUCKS THE ODDS, FEIGNING ADMISSION TO  HARVARD, RENICING ON PRINCIPLE TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH TAXPAYER MONEY INSTEAD WITH HIS OWN HARD  EARNED STOCK GIVEN TO HIM BY A LOCAL BUSINESSMAN. HER NAME WAS ANN DAVIS AND THE MOMENT MITT SAW HER HE KNEW HE WAS TOTALLY GOING TO BUILD THAT. SHE WAS THE IDEAL GENDER, FOR A WIFE. THEY WED ACCORDING TO HUMAN CUSTOM AND THEN MESHING THEIR PRIVATE SECTORS PRODUCED FIVE  MALE OFFSPRING, TAG, CRAIG, BLIG, MARBLE AND FLAPJACK.
ARMED ONLY WITH IVY LEAGUE BUSINESS AND LAW DEGREES, AND THE MITT ROMNEY TRAILED BLAZES  HIS WAY TO A PIONEERING NEW BOSTON FIRM, WHERE HE LEARNED HOW TO SECRETE MONEY. FROM THERE, IT WAS A SERIES OF PERSONAL TRIUMPHS, FROM SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVING 2002 SALT  LAKE OLYMPICS TO ELECTING HIMSELF GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS. BUT THERE IS STILL ONE THING LEFT FOR MITT ROMNEY TO BUILD, A PRESIDENCY. AS THE ELITE EAST COAST HARVARD EDUCATED CREATOR OF ROMNEY CARE STARTED TO RUN, IN THE MOST  CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN FIELD IN HISTORY, ROMNEY REALIZED THAT TERRIBLE TRUTH.
I AM SOMEONE WHO IS A MODERATE AND MY VIEWS ARE PROGRESSIVE.
I WILL PRESERVE AND PROTECT A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE.
WE ALSO SHOULD KEEP WEAPONS OF -- TO BE ON THE STREET.
HE BILLED HIMSELF THE WRONG WAY. IT WOULD TAKE A MONUMENTAL FEAT OF SELF RECONSTRUCTION.
I AM PRO-LIFE.
$122 BILLION.
I DON'T HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT AMERICA NEEDS NEW GUN LAWS.
AROUND THE CLOCK OPERATIONS ACROSS 14 TIME ZONES UNTIL FINALLY.
I WAS A SEVERELY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR.
MITT ROMNEY HAD DONE IT. ALL BY HIMSELF. MITT ROMNEY DID IT ALL BY HIMSELF. MITT ROMNEY, HE IS A HUMAN BEING AND HE BUILT THAT.
Jon: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
