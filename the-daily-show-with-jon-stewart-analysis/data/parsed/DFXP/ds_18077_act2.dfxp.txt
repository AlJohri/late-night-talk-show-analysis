SHOW. LAST WEEK. WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK. WE LEARNED THAT ANOTHER JEWEL OF  AMERICAN JOURNALISM SUP FOR SALE  WITH THE REPORTS THAT THE 132 "LOS ANGELES TIMES" WAS UP FOR  SALE. INTERESTING NAMES. RUPERT MURDOCH VERY INTERESTED  IN THE "LOS ANGELES TIMES".
Jon: THE DEATH WAS NO  ACCIDENT IT WAS -- [LAUGHTER] MURDOCH. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S ONE PROBLEM FOR THE  MEDIA MOGUL HE OWNS TWO  TELEVISION STATIONS IN LOS  ANGELES, KTOV AND KTRV. YOU WOULDN'T WANT RUPERT MURDOCH  TO BECOME DISPROPORTIONATELY  VOLATILE. YOU COULD TAKE HIS AMBITIONS  ELSE WHERE OR PETITION THE  GOVERNMENT FOR A WAIVER. YEAH, CODO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] -- HE COULD DO THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] RUPERT MURDOCH CLEARLY CONSIDERS  HIMSELF A SPECIAL CASE TO ASK  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR THE  PRIVILEGE. I'D LIKE TO GIVE HIM A FAIR  HEARING. LET'S TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. HERE WE GO. LET'S DO IT OVER HERE. HERE WE GO. MR. MURDOCH, I HAVE YOUR RESUME  RIGHT HERE. PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT. HAVE YOU EVER OWNED A NEWSPAPER  PREVIOUSLY?
YES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DINGO GOT YOUR TONGUE,  EH? [LAUGHTER] HERE IT IS "NEWS OF THE WORLD."  OR SHOULD I SAY YOU USED TO OWN  THAT. HOW DID IT WORK OUT.
SIX FORMER STAFFERS HAVE BEEN  ARRESTED ACCUSED OF LISTENING TO  PEOPLE'S PRIVATE VOICEMAILS.
HYING INTO VOICEMAIL MESSAGES  OF AMONG OTHERS THE ROYAL  FAMILY, CELEBRITIES AND EVEN A MURDERED TEENAGER.
WE FIND NEWS CORPORATION  CARRIED OUT AN EXTENSIVE COVERUP  OF RAMPANT LAW BREAKING.
Jon: OKAY. [LAUGHTER] AND NOW YOU WOULD LIKE A WAIVER  TO HAVE ANOTHER WHACK AT A  NEWSPAPER? [LAUGHTER] I ASSUME YOU ARE ASKING US TO  WAIF -- WAIVE OUR LAWS AS A  COURTESY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BREAK THEM. ARE YOU THE TYPE OF NEWSPAPER  OWNER THAT INTERFERES WITH  EDITORIAL POLICY. AND IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT  QUESTION AS A MUCH YOUNGER MAN  PERHAPS GIVING INSIGHT INTO THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR EDITORIAL  PHILOSOPHY. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT AS  WELL.
HOW DO YOU SEE THE ROLE OF A  PROPRIETOR? WOULD YOU INTERFERE IN EDITORIAL  POLICY IF SNENCHES YES, I WOULD.
Stephen: THAT WAS DONE TWO  YEARS AGO AND IT SHOWS THE TOLL  THAT RAMPANT LAW MAKING -- LAW BREAKING I SHOULD SAY -- BOTH. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY LOOK WE WANT TO SAY YES  TO YOU BUT WE NEED YOUR  ASSURANCE THAT WOULD NEVER USE THIS EXTRAORDINARY MEDIA REACH  OF TELEVISION AND NEWSPAPERS TO  CHANGE THE POLITICAL AGENDA, THROW AN ELECTION, THAT SORT OF  THING. THAT'S NOT WHY YOU ARE IN THE  BUSINESS, IS IT?
IF YOU CAN STIMULATE THE  CONVERSATION YOU CAN CHANGE THE  AGENDA.
HE CLAIMED TO HAVE WON AN  ELECTION SINGLE HANDED.
Jon: THANKS FOR COMING BY. WE HAVE TO DECLINE YOUR WAIVER. THE LAW AGAINST MEDIA  CONSOLIDATION WAS CLEARLY WITH  PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN MIND. WELL, ACTUALLY YOU IN  PARTICULAR. BECAUSE OF HOW YOU LIKE TO DO  THE EXACT THING THE LAW -- WHAT  IS THAT THERE, 1993?
