Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A PROFESSOR --  A PROFESSOR -- HISTORY OF  UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI. HE IS ALSO ON AUTHOR. HIS LATEST BOOK IS CALLED KARL  MARX:  A 19th CENTURY LIFE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  JONTAN SPERBE -- JONATHAN  SPERBER. SIR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE. THE BOOK IS SAY "A 19th  CENTURY LIFE:  KARL MARX."  THE FIRST PRIZE IS THAT HE  FATHERED BARACK OBAMA.
IT WAS INTERESTING.
Jon: WELL RESEARCHED I  MIGHT ADD. WE HAVE IN OUR MINDS A TWO  DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER -- MOST OF  THE ICONS OF THE 19th CENTURY OF THE 20th CENTURY. YOU HAVE REALLY BROUGHT TO LIFE  THAT THIRD DIMENSION, HIS  PERSONAL LIFE, ALL THAT. IT CREATES A MUCH MORE CONFUSING  BUT HUMANIZING PORTRAIT OF THE  MAN.
I THINK THAT'S VERY TRUE. MARX DRUGELLED ALL HIS LIFE  WITH -- STRUGGLED ALL HIS LIFE  WITH MONEY PROBLEMS, WORKED VERY HARD AS A JOURNALIST. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. HE WROTE FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST  NEWSPAPER IN THE 1850'S.
Jon: HE WAS DOING WELL, A  PRETTY SUCCESSFUL JOURNALIST WHO  WAS MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF COIN AND THE WHOLE THING GOES TO --
BEING A FREE LANCE WRITER  THEN AS TODAY IS NOT AN EASY WAY  TO MAKE A LIVING.
Jon: HE WOULD HAVE BEEN, I  THINK A BLOGGER. HE WAS PROLIFIC --
YES.
Jon: BUT, YOU KNOW, AS YOU  GO THROUGH HIS WRITINGS THEY ARE  SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE. THEY ARE VERY CONFLICTED.
IT'S REALLY TRUE. MARX WAS A LOT BETTER WITH SHORT  PIECES WHICH HE COULD FINISH  QUICKLY LIKE HIS JOURNALISM.
Jon: THE INTERESTING THING  I DIDN'T KNOW YOU THINK OF HIM  AS A WORKHORSE BUT HIS WORK HABITS WERE SORT OF ODD. HE WROTE THOSE THINGS IN A  COUPLE OF HOURS AT NIGHT, A  LITTLE BIT HERE, A LITTLE BIT  THERE.
HE WAS NOTORIOUSLY A GUY WHO  WORKED IN STREAKS. WORK 48 HOURS IN A ROW, STAY UP  ALL NIGHT, AND THEN COLLAPSE AND  NOT WRITE ANYTHING FOR SEVERAL  WEEKS. THERE'S AN ACCOUNT FROM DUTCH  RELATIVES THAT HE WOULD SIT AT A  TABLE, PONDER, WALK AROUND AND AROUND THE TABLE. SIT DOWN AGAIN, WRITE SOMETHING  AND WALK AROUND AND AROUND.
Jon: HE IS MUCH LIKE THE  COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO LOVE HIM. THAT'S WHAT THEY LOVE ABOUT HIM.
IT'S TRUE.
Jon: THEY SEE THAT GUY AND  SAY THAT'S WHAT I DO. I COLLAPSE AND DO DON'T ANYTHING  FOR TWO WEEKS.
HE DRANK LIKE A LOT OF  COLLEGE STUDENT DOZEN.
Jon: THAT WAS THE  INTERESTING THING, TOO. HE WAS A ROBUST GUY. HE TEND TO THINK OF IT AS MARX  OCCURRED IN BLACK AND WHILE AND  GRAY AND LIVED A COLORLESS LIFE. HE WILL TALKED ABOUT TOIL AS A  MEANS OF PRODUCTION. I GUY KNEW HOW TO THROW DOWN.
HE WAS A PUB CRAWLER. ONCE GOT INTO A FAME RUSS BRAWL  WITH A -- FAMOUS BRAWL IN A PUB.
Jon: HE HAD AN ILL  LEGITIMATE CHILD. HE PULLED A SCHWARZENEGGER.
UNLIKE ARNOLD WITH THE LOZ OF  OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S STILL A MYSTERY HOW THIS  CONCEPTION OCCURRED.
Jon: I THINK IT'S EXCITING  THAT HE HAD A MAID IN A ONE ROOM  APARTMENT. WOULD YOU THINK THAT ACCORDING  TO HIS ABILITY HE COULD PICK UP  HIS TRIEWZ TROUSERS OFF THE  FLOOR.
THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO  HAVE HIS WIFE DO IT. SHE WAS FROM AN ARISTOCRATIC  FAMILY.
Jon: A BRILLIANT WRITER IN  HER OWN WRITE.
SHE WAS A SECRETARY.
Jon: WAS HIS IT DAUGHTER? SHE WAS A WRITER. I APOLOGIZE. HIS DAUGHTER. HIS TO THE GET THROUGH THE WHOLE  THING IN A DAY. HIS DAUGHTER WAS THE WRITER.
PARTIAL CREDIT BECAUSE THEY  ARE BOTH JAKED JENNY.
Jon: THEY ARE BOTH NAMED  JENNY. COME ON! IN FACT THERE'S THAT PICTURE IN  THERE OF HER WITH THE CROSS AND  I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S WEIRD AND THE CAPTION SAID IT'S NOT RELIG  CANNOUS BUT -- RELIGIOUS BUT  POLISH.
IT'S A SYMBOL OF POLISH  UPRISING.
Jon: I GET CREDIT FOR THAT  ONE?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: ARE YOU GRADING ME?
I DO HAVE A LITTLE -- MAYBE  ON MY SMARTPHONE, IF I HAD ONE  I'D BE GRADING YOU.
Jon: YOU WOULD BE GRADING  ME. THIS MAN HIS APPEARANCE CHANGED  SO DRASTICALLY OVER THE YEARS  AND HE SEEMED VERY INFLUENCED BY THE STYLES AND THINGS AROUND  HIM. HE SEEMED MORE INSECURE THAN I  WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.
HE WAS INSECURE AND INSECURE  ABOUT VERY BASIC THING, ABOUT  EARNING ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY. IT WAS AN IDEA OF MANHOOD OF THE  19th CENTURY. A REAL MAN SUPPORTS HIS FAMILY  AND WOMEN AND HIS DAUGHTERS. MARX HAD TROUBLE DOING IT. IT WAS PAINFUL TO ASKED HIS  FRIEND ENGLES FOR MONEY.
Jon: NOT ONLY MONEY BUT HE  TOOK THE HIT ON THE MAID THING.
HE STEPPED FORWARD AND  ANNOUNCED HE WAS THE FATHER. HE ONLY CONFESSED ON HIS DEATH  BED WHO THE REAL FATHER WAS.
Jon: WHATEVER YOU THINK OF  THE ENGLES SHALL THE WORLD'S  GREATEST WINGMAN, I WOULD SAY. WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
Jon: WHATEVER YOU THINK  ABOUT, THE FEROCITY. IT INTEREST -- WAS INTERESTING  WHERE HE HAD VERY LITTLE  INFLUENCE OVER EVEN THE TRADES HE BELONGED TO.
IT WAS FLEETING. THE REVOLUTION IT WAS AN  IMPORTANT FIGURE IN WESTERN  GERMANY. HE WAS THE MOVING SPIRIT BEHIND  THE INTERNATIONAL WORKINGMEN'S  ASSOCIATION, THE SO CALLED FIRST INTERNATIONAL BUT HE WAS FOR A  LOT OF PEOPLE, A VERY OBSCURE  FIGURE. WHAT MADE HIM A CELEBRITY WAS  THE PARIS COMMUNE OF 1870. MARX PUBLICLY ENDORSED IT. HE SUPPORT ID. EVERYBODY WAS HORRIFIED BY WOMEN  HANDLING WEAPONS SHOOTING  SOLDIERS. MARX SUPPORTED IT AND HE WAS A A  BOOGIEMAN AND A GIANTS PUBLIC  FIGURE. HE LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.
Jon: HE ENJOYED THAT.
HE LOVED BEING SOMEBODY THAT  PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF.
Jon: AS IT STANDS NOW I  WONDER IF HIS -- HIS VISION OF  CAPITALISM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE WE HAVE NOW. I WONDER WHAT HE WOULD MAKE OF  IT. WOULD IT BE CHEST BEATING BUT TO  SEE THE FAILURES OF COMMUNISM. WHAT WOULD HE SAY ABOUT THAT?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
Jon: WELL, YOU ARE THE  PROFESSOR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND KNOW THIS, I AM GRADING YOU.
ALL RIGHT. HERE IS MY ANSWER. THERE'S A VERY OBSCURE LETTER HE  WROTE IN 1858 HE SAID WHAT IS  GOING TO HAPPEN. HE WAS EXPECTING A REVOLUTION IN  EUROPE TO BREAK ON ANY DAY. THERE WILL BE RECEIVE LIEWTION  AND COMMUNIST REGIMES IN EUROPE  BUT THE BRITISH AND AMERICAN WILL RULE THE WORLD. WHAT IS GOING TO BE HAPPEN TO  THE COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN A  WORLD DOMINATED BY ANGELO AMERICAN CAPITALISM. THE REVOLUTION DIDN'T HAPPEN  THEM. BUT THEY WRESTLED WITH IT AND  THE ANSWER WAS WE'LL GIVE UP AND  CAPITALISTS WILL DOMINATE THE  WORLD.
Jon: IT'S FASCINATING. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. BUY IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE  ON THE TEST.
IT'S AVAILABLE AS AN E BOOK  FOR THE AUDIENCE.
Jon: IT'S AN E BOOK IF YOU  E
