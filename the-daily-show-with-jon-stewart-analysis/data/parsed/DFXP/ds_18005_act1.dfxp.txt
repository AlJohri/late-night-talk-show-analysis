OCTOBER 8, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT LEGENDARY  GUITARIST PETE TOWNSEND WILL BE  JOINING US. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ONE OF MY ALL-TIME HEROES. QUICK STORY FALLOUT FROM THE  RUMBLE ON SATURDAY NIGHT. OBVIOUSLY OTHER THAN FOR PEOPLE  WHO COULDN'T DOWNLOAD IT, I  APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. IT TURNS OUT THE INTERNET IS A  SERIES OF TUBES. IF YOU STUFF TOO MUCH IN ONE  TUBE, IT WON'T... BUT IT TURNS  OUT MY KIDS WATCHED AND  APPARENTLY THE PHRASE "BULL [BLEEP] MOUNTAIN" WAS AWFULLY  POPULAR WITH MY SON WHO IS EIGHT  YEARS OLD. APPARENTLY NOT AS POPULAR WITH  MY WIFE. IN TERMS OF HIM USING IT. SO, I DROVE HOME THE NEXT DAY  FROM WASHINGTON. I GOT TO THE HOUSE. I GREETED EVERYBODY. I WAS SO EXCITED TO BE HOME. I NOTICED MY SON WAS SITTING  ACROSS THE ROOM GIVING ME THE  STINK EYE. GIVING ME ONE OF THESE. AND SO I GO, HEY, NATE, WHAT'S  UP, MAN? HE GOES, "YOU SHOULD WATCH WHAT  YOU SAY."  I WAS LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"  HE GOES, "KIDS COULD SEE THAT AND USE THAT LANGUAGE AND THEY  COULD GET IN REAL TROUBLE."  THERE YOU HAVE IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE [BLEEP] I'M OUT  OF HERE. AS YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE FACE A  GROWING DEFICIT AND DEBT PROBLEM  IN THIS COUNTRY THAT MITT ROMNEY  HAS VOWED TO FIX. WHILE HE'S NOT SPECIFIC ABOUT  THE MEASURES, THAT ALL CHANGED  AT LAST WEEK'S PRESIDENTIAL  DEBATE
I'M SORRY, JIM, I'M GOING TO  STOP THE SUBSIDY TO PBS. I'M GOING TO STOP OTHER THINGS. I LIKE PBS. I LOVE BIG BIRD. I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU TOO BUT I'M  NOT GOING TO KEEP ON SPENDING  MONEY ON THINGS TO BORROW MONEY  FROM CHINA TO PAY FOR IT
Jon: PACK YOUR TOTE BAGS AND  RIDE THE HIGH CULTURED TRAIN  BACK TO CANCEL TOWN. YOU CAN TAKE YOUR INVISIBLE  ELEPHANT FRIEND WITH YOU, YOU  EIGHT-FOOT TALL YELLOW FEATHERED  FREAK. WHO FIRES BIG BIRD? LOOK, AFTER THE INITIAL ELATION  OF GETTING A SPECIFIC... SETTLE  DOWN. AFTER GETTING A SPECIFIC FROM  ONE OF MR. ROMNEY'S PLANS WHICH  FELT VERY GOOD CAME THE  REALIZATION THAT THIS MOVE TO CUT SESAME STREET MIGHT NOT DO  THAT MUCH TO ADDRESS THE $16  TRILLION DEBT. WELL, YOU COULDN'T BE MORE  WRONG.
THE NUMBERS ARE TRULY  TROUBLING
IT TURNS THAT OUR OUT OF  CONTROL SPENDING INCLUDES  ROUGHLY $450 MILLION GIVEN EVERY  YEAR TO THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING, $8 MILLION  OF THAT GOING TO -- THAT'S  RIGHT -- SESAME WORKSHOP AND BIG  BIRD.
Jon: $8 MILLION. WHY, THAT'S ONE $6 MILLION MAN  AND THEN 20 $100,000 BARS. NOT REALLY A HUGE LINE ITEM IN  THE FEDERAL BUDGET. FOR A GUY LIKE LOU DOBBS, ENDING  THESE CORPORATE HANDOUTS, NO  MATTER HOW SMALL, IS ABOUT  PRINCIPLE
PRESIDENT OBAMA TODAY CALLING  FOR AN END TO $4 BILLION OF TAX  BREAKS FOR BIG OIL. $4 BILLION AMOUNTS TO -- ARE YOU  READY? -- IT REPRESENTS 0008%. $5 TRILLION, AND THIS PRESIDENT  IS FOCUSED, FOR WHATEVER REASON,  IS .0008% OF THE PROBLEM.
Jon: FORGETTING FOR JUST A  SECOND THAT $4 BILLION IS NOT  .0008% OF $5 TRILLION BUT IN  FACT .05%, WHAT'S A COUPLE OF ZEROS BETWEEN LEAD FINANCIAL  ANALYSTS ON A BUSINESS NETWORK? BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THE ARGUMENT  WHICH APPEARS TO BE THAT $8  MILLION IS GREATER THAN $4  BILLION. IN THE WORDS OF A CERTAIN  MATHEMATICALLY INCLINED VAMPIRE,  I BELIEVE THE QUOTE WOULD BE  "THAT'S BULL [BLEEP]." SO WHY WOULD CONSERVATIVES, WHY  WOULD CONSERVATIVES FEEL SO  STRONGLY THAT SESAME STREET HAS  TO GO? I'M KIND OF GETTING THE SENSE  THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE  GOING ON HERE
I THOUGHT SESAME STREET WAS  SUPPOSED TO BE SHARING AND BEING  NICE TO PEOPLE. OVER THE YEARS THEY'VE GOTTEN  MORE LIBERAL
BRAIN WASHING IN THE MOST  OBVIOUS FORM.
PBS, SESAME STREET, PUBLIC  TELEVISION SUCKAL AT THE PUBLIC  TEATS FOR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. IT'S AN INSIDIOUS FORM OF BRAIN  WASHING AND PROPAGANDA BEING AS  USUAL PERPETRATED BY THE LOFTY  LEFT
Jon: I SEE. SO FOX NEWS IS UPSET THAT  EMPTY-HEADED PUPPETS ARE TRYING  TO BRAIN WASH AND INDOCTRINATE  AMERICANS. WELL, PERHAPS... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ... I CAN TELL YOU... PERHAPS  YOU COULD SUE THEM. THE CHARGE COULD BE COPYRIGHT  INFRINGEMENT. YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT FAIR. LET'S TAKE A LOOK, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU A SHOCKING  CLIP OF SESAME STREET. IF YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN,  CHANCES ARE THEY'RE ASLEEP RIGHT  NOW. I WANT YOU TO WAKE THEM, DRAG  THEM DISORIENTED INTO THE ROOM  AND SHAKE THEM AND SAY, "DON'T  LOOK AT THE TV." THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. THEN PUT THEM BACK TO BED. I'LL WAIT. NO, JUST RUN THE CLIP.
WOULD YOU SHARE YOUR FOOD  WITH SOMEONE?
YES. OU WOULD? WHY?
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE  ANY FOOD I'LL GIVE IT TO THEM
IF THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY FOOD,  YOU WOULD GIVE... YOU WOULD GIVE  THEM SOME?
UM-HUM  OH, THAT IS VERY NICE OF YOU. [BLEEP]
Jon: HOW DARE YOU? HOW DARE YOU? I'M SURE THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU   YOU, GROVER. YOUR HEART IS AS RED AS THEY  COME. WE GO TO JOHN OLIVER AND WYATT  CENAC IN OUR REGULAR ISSUE  SEGMENT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: JOHN, WYATT? HOW DOES SESAME STREET MAKE  ITSELF MORE PALATABLE TO  CONSERVATIVES?
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME WORK. THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS.
THAT'S RIGHT. FIRST, THERE'S THE NAME. SESAME STREET.
Jon: YES  GOT AN AWFUL MIDDLE EASTERN  CONNOTATION TO IT.
Jon: AND YOU WOULD SUGGEST? WELL, PATRIOT STREET. â™ª CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET TO  PATRIOT STREET?"
THROUGH FISCAL  RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S HOW.
YES, YES, YES. NUMBER TWO, JON, SPONSORS. THEY NEED TO UNLEASH THE POWER  OF THE FREE MARKET.
Jon: RIGHT. PATRIOT STREET IS BROUGHT TO  YOU BY THE NUMBER MILLER BEER  AND THE LETTER GOLD.
Jon: REALLY? BEER?
AND OTHER TRADITIONAL  AMERICAN VALUES LIKE THE RIGHT  TO BEAR ARMS
EXACTLY. IF PEOPLE ARE GUNNING FOR BIG  BIRD
THEN BIG BIRD HAS THE RIGHT  TO GUN BACK.   ( APPLAUSE )
IT'S TRUE. IME TO CLEAR UP SOME OF  THOSE VICIOUS RUMORS BY FINALLY  MEETING MRS. BIRD AND  MRS. ERNIE.
IT SEEMS VERY DRASTIC. JON, THEY'RE INDOCTRINATING  OUR KIDS, JON.
OUR KIDS! Jon: PATRIOT STREET WOULDN'T  TEACH KIDS TO SHARE?
IT WOULD SIMPLY PUT THAT  SHARING IN CONTEXT. WOULD YOU SHARE YOUR FOOD WITH  SOMEONE?
YES. BUT THAT WOULD CREATE A  CULTURE OF DEPENDENCY
IF I HAVE MY FOOD I'LL GIVE  IT TO THEM
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY THE  MOTIVATION TO EARN THAT FOOD FOR  THEMSELVES
UM-HUM  DID YOU NOT READ THAT COPY OF  ATLAS SHRUGGED I LOANED YOU? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AFTER THE GROUCH HAS BEEN  MOOCHING FOR TOO LONG.
YEP. HE NEEDS TO PULL HIMSELF UP BY  HIS OWN BOOT STRAPS.
Jon: I DON'T THINK OSCAR THE  GROUCH HAS FEET.
OH, MY GOD. NONE OF US HAVE FEET. (SCREAMING)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
