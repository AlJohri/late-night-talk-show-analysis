(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE  NEW DOCUMENTARY FILM CALLED "THE ACT OF KILLING."
John: PLEASE WELCOME JOSHUA  OPPENHEIMER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  JOSHUA, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE,  COMPLICATED, DEVASTATING  DOCUMENTARY. IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS TO WATCH  IT, ABOUT THREE DAYS TO GET OVER  IT. GIVE ME -- GIVE ME -- IN THE  BROADEST POSSIBLE TERMS EXPLAIN  WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND GET INTO  IT.
BASICALLY, IN 1965 THE  INDONESIAN ARMY OVERTHREW THE  DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT, LEFT-LEANING  GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT SUKARNO  AND THEY USED DEATH SQUADS TO KILL ALL THE OPPONENTS OF THE  NEW REGIME AND SOMEWHERE BETWEEN  HALF A MILLION AND TWO AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE WERE KILLED  INLESS THAN A YEAR. AND THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT HAVE  BASICALLY BEEN IN POWER OR  ENJOYED -- BEEN IN POWER EVER SINCE AND SO WHEN YOU ASK THEM  ABOUT WHAT THEY DID, INSTEAD OF  ACTING APOLOGETIC ABOUT IT OR DENYING IT, THEY BOAST ABOUT IT. SO TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF  THEIR BOASTING, WHY THEY'RE  BOASTING, THE EFFECT, HOW THEY SEE THEMSELVES, WHAT THIS MEANS  TO THEIR SOCIETY I LET THEM  DRAMATIZE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN WHATEVER WAYS THEY WISH TO  UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE ACT  OF KILLING.
John: BECAUSE THERE HAS  BEEN NO TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION  IN INDONESIA. THEY ARE LIVING IN THE WORLD  THAT THEY WERE LIVING IN IN 1965  AROUND THE KILLERS, THERE'S BEEN NO JUSTICE FOR THEM. SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS  HOW DID YOU DO THIS? I MEAN, HOW DID YOU GAIN THE  TRUST OF THESE ADMITTED MASS  MURDERERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN  CONVICTED?
WELL, BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN  POWER EVER SINCE IT WAS ALL --  ALL ONE HAD TO DO IS GO AND ASK "WHAT DID YOU DO FOR A LIVING?"  AND TO OUR HORROR THEY WOULD  COME OUT WITH THESE HORRIFIC STORIES OF MASS KILLING AND TELL  THEM IN FRONT OF THEIR  GRANDCHILDREN, THEIR WIVES, THEIR CHILDREN, AND WE STARTED  -- I STARTED TO WONDER WHAT -- I  STARTED TO FEEL AS THOUGH I'D WALKED INTO GERMANY 40 YEARS  AFTER THE HOLOCAUST TO FIND THE  NAZIS STILL IN POWER. AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT  HAD HAPPENED TO THIS SOCIETY AS  A RESULT OF BUILDING A NORMALITY ON THE BASIS OF TERROR.
John: THE VERY TITLE "THE  ACT OF KILLING" IS DEEPLY  PROFOUND BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF THESE MEN, AS YOU SEE, IT WAS A  PERFORMANCE, IT WAS AN ACT. THEY OPENLY SAY THAT THEY WERE  EMULATING MOVIES THAT THEY HAD  SEEN, SOMETIMES THAT THEY HAD LITERALLY JUST WALKED OUT OF.
IN THE CITY WHERE WE MADE THE  FILM, THE ARMY RECRUITED THE  KILLERS FROM THE RANKS OF WHAT WERE CALLED MOVIE THEATER  GANGSTERS. THESE WERE GANGSTERS WHO WERE  SELLING MOVIE THEATER TICKETS ON  THE BLACK MARKET, HANGING OUT IN MOVIE THEATERS AS A BASE --  USING THEM AS A BASE FOR MUCH  MORE SERIOUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND THEY LOVED HOLLYWOOD MOVIES. AND KILLING IS A PROFOUNDLY  HUMAN ACT. WE'RE REALLY THE ONLY SPECIES  THAT DOES IT, BUT IT'S ALSO A  TRAUMATIC ACT. SO KILLERS NEED TO DISTANCE  THEMSELVES FROM WHAT THEY DO AND  ANWAR AND HIS FRIENDS, THE MAN IN "THE ACT OF KILLING" THOSE  ARE THE MAIN CHARACTERS, THEY  USED MOVIES TO DISTANCE  THEMSELVES. THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE MOVIE  THEATER INTOXICATED BY WHATEVER  THEY HAD JUST SEEN AND USED THAT FEELING OF CINEMATIC -- THEIR  LOVE OF CINEMA TO DISTANCE  THEMSELVES FROM THE REALITY OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
John: AND THE DISLOCATION  THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, THAT  IS WHAT IS INCREDIBLE. WHEN THEY WERE REENACTING SCENES  -- THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE YOU'RE  SHOWING ANWAR CONGO, YOU'RE SHOWING HIM TALK ABOUT THESE  HORRORS THAT HE'S INFLICTED AND  YOU WERE EXPECTING IT TO SINK IN AT THAT POINT AND HE SAYS "JOSH,  WHAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE WORN  WHITE PANTS."  AND YOU THINK YOUR PANTS WEAR IS REALLY NOT THE ISSUE HERE. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, EXACTLY. BUT THE THINK IS, ANWAR KNOWS  THAT. BECAUSE IN THE -- THE VERY FIRST  TIME I FILMED ANWAR HE TAKES ME  TO A ROOF TOP WHERE HE KILLED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE,  SHOWS HOW HE DID IT, THEN SAYS  THAT HE IS A GOOD DANCER BECAUSE EVER SINCE KILLING HE'S BEEN  GOING OUT DRINKING, TAKING DRUGS  AND DANCING. AND HE STARTS SHOWING HOW HE'S A  GOOD DANCER. HE DANCE IT IS CHA-CHA THAT ON  THE SPOT WHERE HE'S KILLED  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE CAN DO THIS I  SHOW HIM THAT FOOTAGE BACK AND  HE LOOKED PROFOUNDLY DISTURBED. AND I'M SURE HE'S DISTURBED  ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT  ROOF. ABOUT THE KILLING ITSELF. BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT --  BECAUSE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE TO  ADMIT IT WAS WRONG, WHICH HE'S NEVER BEEN FORCED TO DO. INSTEAD HE SAYS "I SHOULD CHANGE  MY CLOTHES. I SHOULD DYE MY HAIR, I SHOULD  ACT BETTER."  AND IN THAT SENSE HE IS -- HE IS  THE -- THE MOTOR, WHAT IS FUELING THE PROCESS OF  REENACTMENT OF DRAMATIZATION  WHICH MAKES THE FILM MORE AND MORE SURREAL UNTIL IT BECOMES A  KIND OF FEVER DREAM.
John: CAN YOU STICK AROUND  AND GO TO THE WEB? IT'S TRULY ONE OF THE MOST  INCREDIBLE, A -FBGTING,  IMPACTING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. "THE ACT OF KILLING" IS IN THE  THEATERS NOW. JOSHUA OPPENHEIMER. (CHEERS AND
