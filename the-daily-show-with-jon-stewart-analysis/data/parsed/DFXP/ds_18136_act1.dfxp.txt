FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
WELL COME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. WELCOME. MI JOHN OLVER, I'M STILL  SITTING IN FOR JON STEWART  WHO IS CURRENTLY ON AN  UNINHABITED ISLAND IN THE PAS CIVIC LEARNING ABOUT THE  HUMAN CONDITION AND  BEFRIENDING A VOLLEYBALL. OUR GUESTS TONIGHT HERE TO  DISCUSS HIS ONE MAN SHOW  UNCONSTITUTIONAL COLIN QUINN IS GOING TO BE HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  VERY FUNNY MAN. BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH  OUR LOVE AFFAIR WITH FAST  FOOD. WELL, NOT SOME OF A LOVE  AFFAIR AS AN UNHEALTHY ONE  WAY RELATIONSHIP WITH  SOMETHING THAT IS TRYING TO KILL US. (LAUGHTER)  BUT LATELY THAT RELATIONSHIP  HAS BECOME A BIT MORE  STRAINED.
A NATIONWIDE PUSH WORKERS  CALLING FOR A MUCH HIGHER  MINIMUM WAGE.
WORKERS AT McDONALD'S,  WENDIESING DOMINO PIZZA AND  MORE WILL WALK OFF THE JOB  TODAY. HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE ASKING  FOR. THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE AND AN  INCREASE IN WAGES FROM $7.50  AN HOUR TO $15 AN HOUR.
MAKE OUR WAGES SUPERSIZED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YES, YES. CORPORATIONS BE LESS GREEDY,  GIVE OUR WALLETS DIABETES! YEAH, YEAH. IF YOU WANT MY-- [BLEEP] YOUR HAPPY MEAL. YES. LOOK. THIS IS CLEARLY A  COMPLICATED ISSUE. AND THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY  ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO ANY  ACTION AND REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON HOW TO HELP  LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHETHER  IT'S WITH WAGES, TAX CUTS OR GOLDEN TICKETS THAT MAY OR  MAY NOT LEAD TO FUTURE  OWNERSHIP OF A CHOCOLATE  FACTORY. BUT HOW CAN THESE FAST FOOD  WORKERS EVEN BE SURE THEIR  COMPANY CAN AFFORD TO GIVE THEM RAISES.
McDONALD'S MADE 5.5  BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFITS  ALONE LAST YEAR.
YEAH.
OKAY THEN. TO BE HONEST I DIDN'T  REALIZE THE GOLDEN ARCHES  WERE LITERALLY 24 KARAT  GOLD. ALSO, ALSO, JUST TO BE  HONEST, THAT 5.5 BILLION  ISN'T ALL FROM FOOD SALES. TWO-THIRDS OF THAT, THE  HAMBURGLER MADE BY  SPECULATING ON FUTURES. TOTALLY LEGAL, THAT'S THE  INCREDIBLE THING. HE DIDN'T COMMIT A CRIME. LOOK, DEEP DOWN MOST  BUSINESSES WOULD LOVE TO  HELP THE MOST VUL  NEVER-- VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. THEIR QUESTION IS JUST  WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM.
YOU PUT MONEY IN THE  POCKETS OF WORKERS, THEY'RE  GOING TO SPEND T OFTEN AT THE VERY ESTABLISHMENTS  THEY'RE WORKING AT IT WILL  FUEL A POSITIVE CYCLE.
IF WE WERE TO RAISE THE  FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO  10.10 AN HOUR THAT WOULD GENERATE ABOUT $32 BILLION  IN INCREASED CONSUMER  SPENDING.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE GOOD  NEWS FOR EVERYONE. $32 BILLION, FAST FOOD  WORKERS WOULD MAKE MORE  MONEY IT THEY WOULD THEN  SPEND THAT MONEY ON MORE FAST FOOD, MEANING THAT THEY  WOULD HAVE TO SPEND MORE  MONEY IN TURN ON IMODIUM TO COMBAT THE INEVITABLE  DIARRHEA, CHA-CHA CHING. SO THAT IS THE CASE FOR A  HIGHER WAGE. WHAT IS THE CASE AGAINST.
ONLY IN AMERICA CAN OUR  POLITICIANS BEMOAN A LIVABLE  WAGE FOR GETTING ALOT OF FOLKS WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR  ANY WAGE.
PEOPLE ARE NOT IN POVERTY  BECAUSE THEY ARE MAKING  MINIMUM WAGE.
WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT  IS REWARDING MEDIOCRITY.
THE FIRST STEP ON THE LAD  CERTIFICATE NOT TO BE  COMFORTABLE. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE  HANGING OUT THERE. SO YOU DOUBLE THE SALARY,  YOU TURN THAT RUNG INTO A  HAMMOCK.
EXACTLY. YOU REMOVE THE INCENTIVE. IF YOU RAISE THE MINIMUM  WAGE, PEOPLE WILL NEVER STOP  WORKING IN THE FAST-FOOD  INDUSTRY. THEY'LL GET SO COMFORTABLE  IN THOSE HOT KITCHENS AND IN  THEIR ACRYLIC UNIFORMS, RELAXING IN THAT GREASE FOG  SELLING LIKE PROCESSED MEAT  NO MATTER HOW MANY SHOWERS THEY TAKE. OF COURSE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S LUXURY. IT'S LUXURY. THAT'S HIS POINT. KIND OF. OF COURSE HE'S ALSO GOING TO  BE BUSINESS FOR THE SAME  STUPID STUFF ON TELEVISION  INDUSTRY. WELL, NOT SOME OF AN  INDUSTRY AS A COMPANY. BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT  IT-- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,  IF YOU THINK ABOUTING IT, THEY ACTUALLY WORK VERY MUCH  ALONG THE LINES OF THE FAST  FOOD BUSINESS MODEL. THEY SELL YOU SOMETHING THAT  LOOKS APPETIZING BUT LEAVES  YOU FEELING NAUSEOUS FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS. AND ANYWAY, IF THESE WORKERS  WANT A RAISE, WHY DON'T THEY  ASK THEIR LIBERAL MESSIAH.
WHAT A SAD COMMENTARY IT  IS THAT IN THE OBAMA ECONOMY  WE'RE SITTING AROUND A TABLE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEGGING  FOR MINIMUM-WAGE INCREASES. IF THE ECONOMY WERE STRONG,  McDONALD'S WOULD BE PAYING  HIGHER WAGES.
YES. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW  CAPITALISM WORKS. COMPANIES AILES PASS ON  HIGHER PROFITS TO THEIR  LOWER LEVEL WORKERS. THAT'S A FACT. THAT'S JUST-- THAT'S HOW THE  SYSTEM OPERATES. (APPLAUSE)
EVERY ONE REMEMBERS HOW  DURING THE ECONOMIC BOON OF  THE 90s FAST FOOD WORKERS WERE JUST FLINGING PIZZAS  OUT OF THEIR ROLLS-ROYCES. BUT IT TOOK FOX NEW'S NEIL  CAVUTOO TO LEND THIS  ARGUMENT THE PERSONAL TOUCH.
THAT DOESN'T LOOK  ANYTHING LIKE ME. ANYWAY, WHAT I AM ABOUT TO  SAY ISN'T WHAT WE CALL DEMO  FRIENDLY. WHEN I WAS A KID WOULD YOU  BE GRATEFUL FOR ANY JOB YOU  COULD FIND.
LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT  THERE. BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, YOU  DON'T GET TO JOKE THAT  SOUNDING LIKE A CRANKY OLD  MAN IS NOT DEMO FRIENDLY. BECAUSE YOU MUST BE WELL  AWARE THAT THE MEDIAN AGE OF  THE FOX NEW AUDIENCE IS OVER 65 YEARS OLD. OR HOW MUCH OLDER? WELL, NO ONE KNOWS BECAUSE,  AND THIS IS TRUE, NIELSEN  STOPS COUNTING AT 65. BUT I'M SORRY, YOU WERE  ROMANT SIZING YOUR  CHILDHOOD.
ALL I KNOW IS AS SOON AS  I TURNED 16 AND HEARD THAT A  FAST-FOOD CHAIN CALLED ARTHUR --ERS WAS OPENING A  STORE, I GOT THE JOB. AND SOON LOCATED TO RELIEF  MANAGER. THEN WEEKEND MANAGER, THEN  BY THE TENDER AGE OF 16 AND  A HALF YEARS OLD-- FULL-TIME MANAGER, YEAH, IT'S TRUE. IT ALL STARTED AT $2 AN HOUR.
UNFORTUNATELY WORKING AT  ARTHUR --ERS WAS APPARENTLY  THE LAST JOB NEIL CAVUTOO WAS ACTUALLY QUALIFIED FOR  BECAUSE HE IS CERTAINLY NOT  QUALIFIED FOR HIS CURRENT POSITION AS FINANCIAL  ANALYST. BECAUSE AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED  THE MEDIAN FAST FOOD WORKER  TODAY IS ACTUALLY A  28-YEAR-OLD ADULT, AND NOT A 16-YEAR-OLD NEIL CAVUTO  GETTING HIS FIRST JOB TO  EARN MONEY FOR BEER AND  PORN. AND-- FURTHER MORE, CAVUTO'S  $2 AN HOUR WAGE IN 1974  ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION WOULD TODAY BE WORTH NEARLY $9.50  WHICH IS MORE THAN $2 MORE  THAN TODAY'S MINIMUM WAGE. BUT-- IT'S AMAZING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
IT'S INCREDIBLE. IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT HE HAS  THE INCENTIVE TO LEAVE THAT  FOR HIS HIGH PAID JOB ON TELEVISION RIGHT NOW. HE REALLY PULLED HIMSELF UP  BY HIS BOOT STAPS. NOW TO BE FAIR, WHEN THEY  SAW THAT SOME OF THESE  PROTESTORS WERE ADULTS WITH  CHILDREN SOME FOLKS, COMMENTATORS DID ACKNOWLEDGE  IT. BUT IT'S SOMEHOW SEEMED TO  MAKE THEM EVEN MORE ANGRY.
THE GUY THERE HE HAS A  WOMAN NEXT TO HIM WAY BABY,  SHE WAS CRAD KRAED ELLING A BABY AND TALKING ABOUT NOT  FEEDING HIS KIDS. SOMEHOW IT'S McDONALD'S  RESPONSIBILITY TO FEED ALL  HER KID THOSE MATTER HOW  MANY SHE HAS.
WHOA, NO MATTER HOW MANY  SHE HAS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN  ADULT, NOT A POODLE. OH, I'M SO SICK OF THESE GET  RICH WELFARE MOTHERS ASKING  FOR HANDOUTS, MOOCHING PAYCHECKS FROM THEIR  EMPLOYERS IN EXCHANGE FOR  THE WORK THEY JUST HAVE DONE  FOR THEM. IT SICKENS ME, THE GENERAL  CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT  THE MINIMUM WAGE IS LIKE A THAI MASSAGE F 2 DOESN'T  HURT, IT'S NOT WORK. AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BET  THEIR FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR  TRACY BYRNES WRNLS THE GOAL IS LIFE IS NOT TO BE ON  MINIMUM WAGE FOREVER. YOUR GOAL IS TO DO A GREAT  JOB AND GET PROMOTED AND  MOVE OUT OF IT. SO THIS NOTION THAT WE WILL  KEEP RAISING IT JUST TO  SHARE THE WEALTH BECAUSE,  WELL, WE'RE ALMOST SOCIALISTS ANYWAY AT THIS  POINT IS RIDICULOUS.
WOW, WOE WHOA, WHOA,  THAT'S FERR FEWING WHAT SHE  JUST SAID WOCHLT WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE LINE  BETWEEN CAPITALISM AND  COMMUNISM IN AMERICA IS A  DOUBLE DIGIT MINIMUM WAGE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT BOMB  LOOKS FAMILIAR. I THINK I'VE SEEN HER  EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR LOW  WAGE EARNERS AND THE POOR  BEFORE.
IT'S INTERESTING WHENEVER  THE RICH WANT A TAX CUT  SOMEHOW WE CAN AFFORD IT BUT WHEN WE HAVE TO --
250,000 IS NOT RICH. YOU LIVED IN THE CITY LONG  ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT, IT IS  NOT RICH FOR A FAMILY OF  FOUR SENDING KIDS TO  COLLEGE. IT ACTUALLY IS CLOSE TO  POVERTY.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S  RIGHT, HEY, SHE'S RIGHT! SHE'S RIGHT. IF YOU WANT TO EARN TRACY  BYRNES SYMPATHY COME BACK  WHEN ARE YOU MAKING A  QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS A  YEAR. THEN WILL YOU KNOW WHAT  POVERTY IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. CLEARLY TRACY BYRNES APPLE  DID NOT FALL FAR FROM THE  TREE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. I DON'T OFTEN LIKE TO DABBLE  IN SERVICE JOURNALISM. FRANKLY I THINK IT'S BENEATH  ME. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DO THE  FAST FOOD WORKERS OF AMERICA  A FAVOR RIGHT NOW. YOU SEE THESE FACES NEXT TO  ME, ALL THESE PEOPLE HAVE  BEEN SAYING TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT YOU. SO I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER  THESE FACES. AND IF ANY OF THESE PEOPLE  HAPPEN TO COME INTO YOUR  RESTAURANT, I'M NOT SAY  SHALL DID -- I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM THE  SPECIAL SAUCE, I'M JUST  SAYING I THINK IT'S PRETTY  CLEAR THEY DESERVE  TELEPHONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
