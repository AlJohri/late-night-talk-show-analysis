(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO -- WHEN IT COMES TO -- WHEN IT COMES TO LAYING SIEGE TO A CITY, WE ALL HAVE OUR FAVORITE METHODS. YOU MAY BE A STARVE THEM OUT GUY. I'M A CATAPULT GUY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE IS A LOT OF WAYS TO MAKE A CITY UNLIVABLE. JESSICA WILLIAMS REPORTS.
WATER, IT'S THE SOURCE OF LIFE. AND THERE'S A NEW WATER CRISIS AFFECTING AN ENTIRE POPULATION. IN DETROIT.
THE U.S. CITY OF DETROIT IS FACING BANKRUPTCY AND IT'S SO DESPERATE FOR MONEY IT'S CUT OFF WATER TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T PAID THEIR BILLS.
AND TURNING OFF THE WATER TO DETROIT'S POOREST RESIDENTS MADE THOSE PEOPLE A LITTLE UPSET.
WHOSE WATER?
OUR WATER.
NOLAN FINLEY OF THE "DETROIT NEWS".
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE WITH THESE PROTESTORS IS THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS CITY NEXT. THAT SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT, IS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS HERE. WHY AREN'T YOU PAYING?
WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE PAYING? IT IS THE PERFECT SCHEME, YOU KNOW, STEP ONE, BE POOR. STEP TWO, DON'T PAY YOUR WATER BILL. STEP THREE, HAVE YOUR WATER SHUT OFF. STEP FOUR, -- WHAT IS STEP FOUR?
YOU HAVE CONSCIENTIOUS CITIZENS PAYING FOR IT. AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN PAY BUT DON'T THEY'RE FREELOADING.
NO ONE HAS EVER ASKED FOR FREE WATER. WHAT THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE ASKED FOR IS AFFORDABLE PAYMENT PLANS.
LAWYER ALICE JENNINGS HAS BEEN FIGHTING THE SHUTTOFF SINCE LAST SUMMER.
WHY WOULD YOU PICK A FIGHT WITH POOR PEOPLE?
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO WIN.
YEAH.
IT PROBABLY IS EASY TO WIN. AND --
PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES.
BUT EVEN WITHOUT  LIFE-SUSTAINING WATER, THEY HAVE MANAGED TO BESMIRCH AN ALREADY TROUBLED CITY.
WHY PICK ON DETROIT? WHY SHOULD DETROIT BE THE ONLY PLACE THAT HAS TO PASS OUT FREE WATER.
WHO HAVE YOU HEARD ASK FOR FREE WATER?
YOU HAVE A LOT OF THESE FOLKS OUT THERE SAYING DETROIT SHOULDN'T BE CHARGING PEOPLE FOR WATER.
BUT WHO HAVE YOU HEARD LITERALLY ASK FOR FREE WATER.
IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS, YOU ARE ASSUMING YOU CAN GET YOUR WATER FOR FREE.
SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T PAYING DON'T WANT FREE WATER, THEY WANT A PAYMENT PLAN ADJUSTED TO THEIR INCOME?
ABSOLUTELY IT'S POSSIBLE.
SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, BY FRAMING IT AS SAYING PEOPLE JUST WANT FREE WATER, WHICH NO ONE HAS ACTUALLY SAID, ARE YOU SOMEWHAT MISLEADING THIS ARGUMENT RIGHT NOW?
IN WHAT, IN WHAT SENSE? THE CASE HERE IS YOU HAVE GOT A CITY THAT IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO SURVIVE.
BUT SHUT OFF RECIPIENT AND ACTIVIST ATPEACE MAKITA THINKS WATER IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO THAT END.
YOU NEED WATER TO LIVE. YOU WERE BORN IN WATER. YOUR BRAIN SITS IN WATER.
MY BRAIN SITS IN A CHALIS FULL OF FRESCA. LOOK THIS CITY HAS TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AND SO DO YOU.
BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING WITHOUT WATER WHILE WE HAVE THE CORPORATIONS IN THE CITY LIKE THE DETROIT TIGER STADIUM, EASTERN MARKET, JOE LOUIS ARENA WHERE THE RED WINGS PLAY, THESE PARTICULAR ENTITIES THEY OWE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BUT THEIR WATER WAS STILL RUNNING.
FOR REAL?
THE ISSUE IS THAT THOSE THAT ARE IN OFFICE ARE A LITTLE [BLEEP] UP.
TURNS OUT THE LIONS, THE RED WINGS AND EVEN THE LOCAL GOLF COURSE COLLECTIVELY OWED MILLIONS. AND IN MY OWN FIELD TEST I CONFIRMED THEIR WATER WAS STILL FLOWING.
MOTHER [BLEEP].
IN FACT, OUT OF THE 145 MILLION DOLLARS IN DELINQUENT WATER BILLS, NEARLY HALF WERE FROM COMMERCIAL AND MUNICIPAL ACCOUNTS. AND YET THE CITY TARGETED RESIDENTS.
IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS, IT GETS SHUT OFF.
WELL ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE. FORD FIELD, JOE LOUIS STADIUM, THEY OWED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN WATER BILLS AND HAD YET TO BE SHUT OFF.
AND THEY OUGHT TO BE.
BUT THEY WEREN'T.
THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE IS RESPECT.
YEAH EXACTLY, IT'S LIKE THE CITY IS BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO GIVE YOU THE BEST GOLF COURSES AND ICE HOCKEY STADIUMS AND YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY THANK YOU.
ONCE AGAIN, POOR PEOPLE WERE JUST BLAMING THE VICTIM. INNOCENT 18 HOLE GOLF COURSES WHO DESPERATELY NEED THEIR WATER FOR CRITICAL FOUNTAINING, TO COVER EMBARRASSING BALD SPOTS. AND OF COURSE, FOR THIS.
THIS IS OUR PREMIUM BALL WASHER.
YOU SEE, DETROIT NEEDS THIS WHITE DUDE TO WASH HIS BALLS AND EVERYONE ELSE JUST NEEDS TO GET CREATIVE WHEN THEY ARE THIRSTY, LIKE GOING TO JOE LOUIS ARENA TO BORROW SOME OF THEIR WATER.
DO YOU HAVE ANY WATER OR SHOWERS HERE? FOR LIKE ME AND 5,000 OF MY FRIENDS?
AND FOR WHEN YOU GET KICKED OUT, SIMPLY TAKE THE ADVICE OF COUNCIL WOMAN SHEILA COCKREL.
GO TO THAT RIVER, PICK UP A BUCKET OF WATER. THAT IS YOUR RIGHT.
EXACTLY. AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK -- SEE IT'S DOPE! BE YOUR OWN WATER BUCKET.
WHAT IF IT'S NOT RAINING?
THEN YOU CAN PUT SOME BEER IN THOSE CUPS, BABY. UP TOP. READY TO PARTY. YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. DOING IT TO MYSELF. DANCING BY MYSELF.
IN THE END, WE MUST CHERISH ONE RESULT FOR A FUNCTIONAL CITY.
WELL, I MEAN, THERE'S NO -- NOTHING IS FREE.
EXCEPT FOR WATER FOR FOOTBALL STADIUMS, ICE HOCKEY RINKS AND GOLF COURSES.
Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
