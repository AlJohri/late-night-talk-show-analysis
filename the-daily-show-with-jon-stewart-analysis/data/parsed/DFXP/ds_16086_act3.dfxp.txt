( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT EDITOR OF THE "THE WEEKLY STANDARD."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BILL KRISTOL. SIR! ( APPLAUSE ) BILL! BILL! WHAT ARE WE-- WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHAT ARE WE DOING? AFGHANISTAN.
IT'S BEEN A GOOD SHOW SO FAR.
Jon: FINE PROGRAM, ISN'T IT?
IT IS A GOOD PROGRAM. I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT DECISION.
Jon: SUPER MARIO BONERS.
I'M NOT WITH YOU ON THAT PART. LAUGH ( LAUGHTER ) I SAW YOU PLAYING THE GAME.
Jon: I HAVE KIDS. I LOVE VIDEO GAMES, BUT I STILL THINK THERE IS A CERTAIN LIMIT TO WHAT-- I MEAN, ONCE YOU START  DISEMBOWELING YOUR MORTAL COMBAT OPPONENT, I WOULD THINK A 10-YEAR-OLD SHOULD HAVE TO NOT  BE ABLE TO BUY THAT.
I THINK EVEN A 25-YEAR-OLD MAYBE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BUY THAT. I MEAN, IT REALLY IS GROTESQUE. I GET THAT IT'S FREE SPEECH, TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS TO POLITICAL SPEECH, --
IT WOULD BE FUN TO PLAY. I WILL SAY THAT. BUT, NO--
YOU'RED ANY AT IT I HEAR FROM YOUR GUYS BACK THERE.
Jon: SETTLE DOWN. I HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO DURING THE DAY SPEAKING OF MORTAL COMBAT. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S GOING TO PULL OUT 10,000 TROOPS AND EVERYBODY IS VERY NERVOUS ABOUT  THAT, BUT WE DO HAVE TO LEAVE THESE PLACES, LIKE AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, AT SOME POINT, DO WE NOT?
RIGHT, AND WE HAVE LEFT IRAQ IN BULK AND DID SO AFTER A SUCCESSFUL --
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE HAVE IN IRAQ?
50,000.
Jon: THAT'S NOT LEAVING.
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SLOPE DOWN TO ZERO AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THAT'S WHERE THE SURGE WORKED. IT BECAME MUCH MORE PEACEFUL AND WE DREW DOWN, 130,000 OF FROM THE SURGE. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SURGE IN AFGHANISTAN WORKED PRETTY WELL. EVERYONE AGREED WE WERE GOING TO DRAW DOWN. I'M WORRIED HE'S DRAWING DOWN TOO FAST AND ABRUPTLY. I WISH HE FOLLOWED GENERAL PETRAEUS' RECOMMENDATION BUT EVERYBODY AGREES WE'LL BE OUT OF  THE COMBAT PORTION OF IT BY 2014.
Jon: AS A COUNTRY, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS PROOF POSITIVE THAT OUR WHOLE MENTALITY ABOUT  FIGHTING THE WAR ON TERROR HAS BEEN WRONG FOR 10 YEARS? WOULD YOU SAY NOW-- WOULD YOU-- WOULD YOU STAND AND FACE THE CAMERA AND SAY-- AND-- AND--  BUTTON YOUR COAT-- AND SAY, OH, MY GOD. I HAD THIS SO COMPLETELY WRONG, GUYS.
NO.
Jon: BOUT BUTT HOW CAN--
THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS. AND I THINK ON THE WHOLE DOING THE RIGHT THING. LOOK, A WAR-- A WORLD IN WHICH AMERICANS HAVE TO FIGHT AND HAVE TO BE, IN EFFECT, THE KIND OF  WORLD POLICEMEN IS A DIFFICULT WORLD FOR US. GOD KNOWS WE ALL HATE TO SEE YOUNG AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN GO OVER THERE AND FIGHT AND GET  WOUNDED AND DIE. ON THE OTHER HAND, A WORLD IN WHICH WE DON'T DO THAT IS A MORE DANGEROUS WORLD.
Jon: ISN'T THAT A FALSE CHOICE BECAUSE A WORLD WHERE, YOU KNOW, IN TERRORISM WE PLAY CHAK-A-MOLES. EIGHT TO 10 PLACES, RIGHT? IF COVERING TWO HOLES ON THE GAME COSTS $10 BILLION A MONTH AND COUNTLESS AMERICAN LIVES, HOW DO WE COVER-- AND DOES IT MAKE US ANY SAFER BECAUSE EVEN STABILIZING IRAQ OR STABILIZING  AFGHANISTAN DOESN'T MAKE IT A COUNTRY WHERE TERROR ATTACKS CANNOTTING PLOTTED AGAINST THE  UNITED STATES. IN DEMOCRACIES, TERROR ATTACKS ARE PLOTTED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. SO ISN'T OUR WHOLE STRATEGY, AS YOU AND MY PEOPLE WOULD SAY WRONG? DON'T WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR STRATEGY IN HUGE WAYS?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD --
REALLY. I THAT YOU YOU WERE GOING TO GO WITH ME ON THAT ONE. I THOUGHT I HAD YOU ON THAT ONE.
LET ME CALL MICHELE BACHMAN FIRST AND GET MY TALKING POINTS  FROM THE LIKELY NEXT-- THAT WAS EXCELLENT. THAT WAS VERY GOOD.
Jon: THANK YOU.
IT'S UNUSUAL.
Jon: IT'S NOT JUST THE CLIPS THEY SHOW ON FOX. WE ACTUALLY DO A WHOLE PROGRAM?
IS THAT RIGHT?
Jon: WE DO A WHOLE PROGRAM.
YOU DID WELL. YOU DID WELL. I WANT TO SAY YOU DID WELL ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY AND I THINK YOU HAVE A POSSIBLE FUTURE AT FOX NEWS.
Jon: THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
I THINK A FEW MORE TESTS --
Jon: STOP IT. BUT I'M BEING SERIOUS--
WE --
WE CAN'T DO IT.
WE CAN'T BUT WE'RE NOT DOING IT EVERYWHERE. IN YEMEN AND SOMALIA WE'RE USING DROPZ. PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT IN THE LEAST-PEOPLE-INTENSIVE WAY POSSIBLE BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE  ALL OVER THE PLACE.
Jon: DO WE HAVE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE IDEA OF REBUILDING COUNTRIES THAT WE IN  SOME WAYS HELPED UNBUILD? ( LAUGHTER )
LOOK, IN AFGHANISTAN, WE HELPED DRIVE THE SOVIETS OUT OF THERE. WE PULLED OUT OF THERE IN 89, 90 91. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS, THE PEOPLE IN EXPWAFG IN TERMS OF 9/11. I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. IF THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO KEEP 100,000 TROOPS THERE FOREVER, IT'S A WAR THAT WAS UNDERRESOURCED UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH. PRESIDENT OBAMA DID THE RIGHT THING, I THINK, IN SURGING THERE AND I THINK WE CAN DRAW DOWN AS  LONG AS WE DO SO RESPONSIBLY. IT'S NOT EASY, THOUGH, AND THERE'S NO ONE SOLUTION FOR EACH PART OF THE WORLD, OBVIOUSLY. BUT WE CAN'T TURN OUR BACKS ON THE WORLD, JON. I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT A STRAWMAN HERE.
Jon: I'M VERY FOND OF THE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GET HURT--
AND THE WORLD IS VERY FOND OF YOU.
Jon: RIGHT NOW, THE MILITARY AND MILITARY FAMILIES ARE BEARING AN OVERWHELMING WEIGHT  OF THESE WARS, AND IT'S NOT FAIR WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH, AND  I JUST FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO COME UP WAY WHOLE NEW STRATEGY, THAT'S ALL. ( APPLAUSE ) I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW.
I AGREE WITH THE LAST STATEMENT TO SOME DEGREE. I DO --
YOU QUALIFY EVERYTHING.
IF YOU GO TO THE PENTAGON THEY'LL SAY THAT, THE ARMY AND  MARINES ARE FIGHTING THE WAR AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING. THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW TO HELP BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH THAT.
Jon: THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BY. BILL KRISTOL, EVERYBODY.
