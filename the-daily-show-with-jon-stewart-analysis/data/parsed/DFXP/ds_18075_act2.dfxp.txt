Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM. WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT  OUTREACH FOR MORE ON THE  REPUBLICAN PARTIES ATTEMPT TO GROW THEIR BASE, BE MORE  INCLUSIVE WE ARE JOINED BY  SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT MR. LARRY WILMONT. LARRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  REPUBLICANS TRYING TO REACH OUT  TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE?
SURE, JON. HEY, REPUBLICANS, SEEING AS HOW  YOU SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND A  HALF TRYING TO KEEP US FROM VOTING TRY AT LEAST TOP SOUND  LIKE YOU ARE HAPPY REACHING OUT  TO US.
WE HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER  JOB AND A LOT MORE TO MAKE UP  GROUND IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
I MEAN YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ARE  ANNOUNCING, YEAH, THE TEST  RESULTS CAME BACK AND IT'S GONE  REA. YOU HAVE TO SAY IT LIKE, HEY,  GUYS, THERE'S CAKE IN THE  BREAKROOM.
Jon: THEY NEED TO CURB  THEIR LACK OF ENTHUSIASM FOR  THIS OUTREACH?
RIGHT. THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS. REMEMBER DURING THE ELECTION  REPUBLICANS WERE ABOUT BUILD THE  DANG FENCE AND SELF DEPORTATION NOT ANYMORE.
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO DO  IMMIGRATION REFORM.
THAT'S NICE. YOU WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WHY IS THAT?
ELECTIONS. ELECTIONS.
DON'T SAY IT OUT LOUD. THAT'S LIKE CALLING A GIRL AND  GOING HOW WAS YOUR DAY? OKAY. LET'S GET OUT TO DINNER. WHY? BECAUSE I WANT TO (bleep) YOU.
Jon: NUMBER TWO, CONCEAL  YOUR CYNICISM.
YOU DON'T HELP MINORITIES  LORD KNOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T  BUT AT LEAST THEY SEEM HAPPY TO SEE YOU. REALLY, WE'RE THE ONES YOU'VE  BEEN WAITING FOR, THANK YOU.
Jon: FLATTERY IS CATCHING. CATCHY IS BETTER THAN THE TRUTH. IF YOU NEED BLACKS TO HELP  RECONSTRUCT THE PARTY FIND  BLACKS MORE CURRENT THAN THE  RECONSTRUCTION.
I AM A CONSERVATIVE BUT  THAT'S NOT HOW -- I'M A    FREDERICK DOUGLASS REPUBLICAN.
FREDERICK DOUGLASS DIDN'T  DJANGO SHOOT HIM.
Jon: THERE WAS A LOT OF  SHOOTING SO I'M NOT SURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
IF YOU WANT TO GET MINORITIES  ON BOARD STOP PLAYING THE  VICTIM. WHAT WAS THAT CPAC PANEL CALLED? TRUMP THE RACE CARD. ARE YOU SICK AND TIRED OF BEING  CALLED A RACIST AND YOU KNOW YOU  ARE NOT ONE? OKAY, FIRST OF ALL WHY DOES  DONALD TRUMP HAVE TO PUT HIS  NAME ON EVERYTHING? SERIOUSLY JON? WHAT KIND OF NARCISSISTIC  (bleep) WANTS NAMING RIGHTS ON  RACISM.
Jon: THEY WANTED TO TALK  OPENLY ABOUT RACE AND RACISM.
IT WAS OPEN ALL RIGHT.
HE WRITES A LETTER TO A  FORMER SLAVE AND SAYS I FORGIVE  YOU FOR ALL THE THINGS YOU DID TO ME.
FOR GIVING HIM SHELTER AND  FOOD ALL THESE YEARS?
HE'S DEFENDING SLAVE OWNERS. OH, MY GOD, JON, THAT'S  FANTASTIC. KNOLL WONDER THAT GUY IS SICK OF  BEING CALLED RACIST. I BET HE GETS CALLED RACIST BUT  OTHER RACISTS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
Jon: FOOD AND SHELTER HE  WOULD LICK REPARATIONS FOR  DESCENDENTS OF SLAVE OWNERS.
JON, IT'S NOT BAD. YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD IT FOR THE  PAST 150 YEARS.
Jon: FOOD, SHELTER, FREE  TRANSATLANTIC CRUISES. THAT DOESN'T COME CHEAP.
MAYBE THERE'S SOME  COMPENSATION FOR THAT.
Jon: HOW ABOUT 40 MULES AND  AN ACRE. WE'RE BOTH JOKING, RIGHT? AREN'T WE JOKING ABOUT THIS?
I'M NOT ANYMORE, JON. I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED OUT  HOW BLACK PEOPLE CAN GET  REPARATION, OFFER THEM TO THE DESCENDANTS OF SLAVE OWNERS. ACCORDING TO ANCESTRY THAT IS  ABOUT 90% OF BROTHERS. [  APPLAUSE  ] OKAY, JON CSM THAT ACRE BE  ANYWHERE --
Jon: NO, THANK YOU.
