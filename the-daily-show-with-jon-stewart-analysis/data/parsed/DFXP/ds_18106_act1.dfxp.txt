Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL    FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY  SHOW WITH JON STEWART.
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. MAN WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. COMING ON THE PROGRAM  TONIGHT, 11 TIME NBA  CHAMPION COACH PHIL JACKSON  WILL BE JOINING US. PHIL JACKSON, THE LEAST  KNOWN MEMBER OF THE JACKSON  5. LISTEN TO THIS, WHO'S THAT  TALL WHITE GUY? STANDING NEXT TO TITO? WE ALL KNOW NATIONAL  POLITICS IS-- BUT LOCAL  GOVERNMENT AIN'T BEAN BAG,  PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF  THAT MEANT. JUST PHRASES I PICKED UP  FROM WATCHING ANY RANDOM 30  SECONDS OF CHRIS MATTHEWS. BUT MY POINT IS THIS, EVEN  MAYOR, MAYORS CAN FIND  THEMSELVES EMBROILED IN  SCANDAL WHETHER IT IS THE WAY THEY REACT TO LOCAL  COMPLAINTS ABOUT RAISE  PROFILING OF HISPANICS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT  LATINO COMMUNITY TODAY.
I MIGHT HAVE TACOS WHEN I  GO HOME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I WILL NEVER TIRE OF  TACO MAYOR. LIKE THE SNACK HE BELIEVES  WILL EASE THE TENSION  BETWEEN HIS OFFICE AND  LATINO COMMUNITY, I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT  MAYORS IS THEY CAN MAINTAIN  THE EXCENTRICITIES THAT GET SANDED OFF AND FOCUS GROUPED  OUT OF STATEWIDE OR NATIONAL  POLITICIAN, ENDEARING POLICIES LIKE FEAR OF LARGE  BEVERAGES. OR BEING A NINE AND A HALF  FINGERED BULGARIAN OR HAVING  MEAT AND CHEESE FOR A HEAD. (LAUGHTER)  GUESS WHICH ONE OF THOSE  MAYORS IS NOT KOSHER. GUY WITH THE CHEESEBURGER  FOR A HEAD. BUT EVENING AMONGST THE  IDIOSYNCRATIC SOME MAYORS  STAND OUT. FOR INSTANCE TORONTO MAYOR  FORMER CITY COUNCILMAN WHO  HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR IN  TORONTO FOR HIS LOVE OF SPORTS-- AND HIS WARM  RELATIONS WITH THE PRESS,  YES, THE CAMERA JUST  ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS MAYOR. (LAUGHTER)  HOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SHOT  FROM THE POV. CAMERA HE WALKED INTO,  CRIMINAL. NOW OF COURSE DON'T THINK  THIS GUY IS JUST ALL  PRATFALLS WITH COME DEE, HE  HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED WITH HIS ARM AROUND A NEO-NAZI  AND EXPLAINED WHY STORES  SHOULD BE OPENED AN  STATUTORY HOLIDAYS THUSLY.
WHAT SOME ARE CALLING A  BACKHANDED COMPLIMENT TO  TORONTO'S AGING COMMUNITY.
THOSE ORIENTAL PEOPLE  WORKED LIKE DOGS. THEY WORKED THEIR HEARTS  OUT. THEY ARE WORKERS NONSTOP. THEY SLEEP BESIDE THEIR  MACHINES. THE ORIENTAL PEOPLE, THEY  ARE SLOWLY TAKING OVER.
Jon: PERHAPS HE'LL HAVE  TO HAVE SOME EGG ROLLS  TONIGHT TO MAKE UP FOR THAT. AFTER REPEATED INSTANCES OF  THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR YOU  HAVE GOT TO WONDER, IS THIS DUDE ON CRACK? WELL, FUNNY STORY.
THERE'S A CELL PHONE  VIDEO THAT SHOWS THE MAYOR  ALLEGEDLY SMOKING A CRACK  PIPE.
Jon: HEY, HEY! DON'T JUDGE HIM. MAYBE HE'S CLEANING UP THE  CITY BY SMOKING ALL THE  CRACK IN IT. YOU'RE NEXT, PROSTITUTION  RING. (LAUGHTER)  THE CELL PHONE VIDEO WHICH  IS APPARENTLY VIEWED BY THE  TORONTO STAR AND THE WEB SITE GAWKER, IT APPEARS THE  VIDEO SHOWS THE MAYOR OF  TORONTO SMOKING CRACK WITH DRUG DEALERS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  DEPUTY MAYOR OF TORONTO.
CERTAINLY WE ALL KNOW  THAT VIDEOS CAN BE ALTERED. AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT  DRUG DEALERS CAN'T BE  TRUSTED.
Jon: PHOTOS CAN EASILY BE  ALTERED. BUT VIDEOS? THAT'S SOME JAMES CAMERON [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, IF YOU CAN ALTER  VIDEOS WHY WOULDN'T YOU  START WITH THESE TWO. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S THE CAMERA ONE THAT  DOES IT EVERY TIME. WE'VE ALL TRIPPED PLAYING  FOOTBALL BUT-- INTERESTINGLY  FORD'S PERSONAL LAWYER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE GOING THE  FAKE VIDEO ROUTE. THE MAYOR'S LAWYER INTEND  INTEND-- INSTEAD ASKED QUOTE  HOW YOU CAN INDICATE WHAT THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY DOING  OR SMOKING? I MEAN THAT CLEAR PIPE IN  HIS HAND COULD BE ANYTHING  FROM ASTHMA MEDICINE TO  WONDER WOMAN'S FAMED INVISIBLE PIPE OF TRUTH TO A  WATERFORD CRYSTAL KAZOO TO  CRACK. IT COULD BE CRACK, I GUESS. FOR MORE WE TURN TO OUR  SENIOR CANADIAN  CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE  AND JASON JONES. THEY JOIN USNOW FROM  TORONTO. SAM, THANKS FOR-- SAM.
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SAM, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE  AWE AND JASON, WHERE IS  JASON.
OH, HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HE'S JUST BUYING SOME CRACK.
Jon: WAIT, JASON, CRACK.
YEAH, HE'S CANADIAN! JON, WE ALL DO IT, SMOKING  CRACK IS ONE OF CANADA'S  MOST CHERISHED PASTIMES.
Jon: SO --
SORRY I'M LATE. I WAS JUST BUYING SOME  CRACK. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S ONE OF CANADA'S MOST  CHERISHED PASTIMES.
I ALREADY SAID THAT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, I'M  JUST WHACKED OUT OF MY MIND  ON CRACK.
Jon: JASON, THAT'S AN  AWFUL LOT OF CRACK YOU'VE  GOT THERE.
WELL, I'VE GOT THREE KIDS  AT HOME, JON. AND THEY ALL SMOKE CRACK.
Jon: I'M-- MY MINE IS  BLOWN HERE, YOU KNOW. ITS CANADIAN PAST TIME I  THINK OF CANADA I THINK OF  POLITENESS AND CLEAN STREETS AND --
WELL, SURE, JON, IT'S ALL  OF THAT ON THE SURFACE.
AND JUST UNDER THAT  SURFACE IS A THICK LAYER OF  CRACK.
YEAH.
JON, CANADA IS NOT LIKE  THE POSTCARDS YOU BUY AT  NIAGARA FALL, IT'S LIKE THE POSTCARDS YOU BUY FROM THE  GUY IN TORONTO WHOSE [BLEEP] YOU SUCK FOR CRACK.
Jon: WHAT? YOU ARE ON-- YOU ARE ON  TELEVISION, SO YOU-- YOU  GUYS HAVE TO [BLEEP] FOR  CRACK?
UH, YEAH, YEAH, SURE, WE  HAVE TO. (LAUGHTER)
JON, WHY DO YOU THINK  THEY ONLY SELL ALCOHOL AT  GOVERNMENT RUN DISPENSARIS. CAN WANT-- WE CAN'T BE  TRUSTED WITH ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE THAT OLD FRENCH  CANADIAN SAYING, S'IL EST  DANS LA MAISON.
IF IT'S IN THE HOUSE.
NOUS IL FUMEE.
WE WILL SMOKE IT.
APRES BEE COUP DEGRANDE  BLOW JOBS.
YOU CAN PROBABLY  TRANSLATE THAT ONE YOURSELF.
Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,  WHOA, JASON! JAYSON, STOP THAT, ARE YOU  SMOKING CRACK RIGHT NOW?
IT'S 6 A.M. SOMEWHERE.
OH MY GOD, JON, ARE YOU  JUDGING US? THIS IS OUR NATIONAL LETTER  TAJ. NOT TO MENTION THE DRIVER OF  OUR ECONOMY. CAN GA'S LARGE-- CANADA'S  LARGEST NATIONAL INDUSTRY IS  CRACK PRODUCTION. AND OUR SECOND LARGEST  INDUSTRY IS GIVING BLOW JOBS  FOR CRACK!
Jon: THIS SIN SANE. I MEAN IT'S LIKE CANADA IS  THAT FRIEND YOU HAVE IN HIGH  SCHOOL THAT ALL YOUR PARENTS LOVE THEM BECAUSE HE'S SO  POLITE AND CALLS EVERYBODY  MR. AND MRS. S BUT YOU FIND OUT HE IS A DATE RAPEST WITH  A ROOFY --
WLOE, EASY, WE ARE NOT A  NATION OF DATE RAPISTS. WE ARE A NATION OF BLOW JOB  BESTOWING CRACK AFFICIONADOES. BY THE WAY, YOU GOT ANY  CRACK, I'LL BLOW YOU FOR IT?
Jon: JASON, YOU HAVE A  WOL BACK!
