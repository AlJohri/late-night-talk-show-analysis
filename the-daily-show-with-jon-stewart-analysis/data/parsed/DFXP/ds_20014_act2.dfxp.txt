[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. WE'RE HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME. THE PEOPLE HERE ARE SO NICE. YOU KNOW, HERE IN AUSTIN WE'RE HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THIS. AND YOU CAN ASK PEOPLE. FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS. THE TRUE MEASURE OF A CITY IS HOW MANY BATS ATTACK YOU AT SUN DOWN. AND I REALLY FEEL LIKE BY THAT MEASURE, THIS TRULY IS THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A LOT OF BATS. A LITTLE SCARY. BUT I WILL SAY THIS -- TEXAS, ITSELF, THE EGO -- [LAUGHING] GOT TO PUT THEIR NAME ON EVERYTHING. TEXAS HAS IT'S OWN TEA. IT'S OWN HOLD 'EM. TEXAS GOTTA BE TEXAS HOLD 'EM. IT COULD JUST BE CALLED HOLD 'EM. THERE ARE NO OTHER HOLD 'EMS. NO OTHER STATE HAS HOLD A 'EM. THERE'S NO RHODE ISLAND HOLD 'EM. BUT TEXAS HAS TO HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIAL. THE TEXAS TWO STEP. WHY DO YOU NEED AN EXTRA STEP FOR? IT'S FINE. JUST HAVE A STEP. HERE YOU KNOW, I GUESS TEXAS IS BIGGER, SO THEY NEED TO DOUBLE UP WITH THE STEPS. I MEAN, FOR GOD SAKE TOAST. YOUR OWN [BEEP] TOAST, REALLY? TEXAS. TEXAS TOAST. ALONE AMONG ALL 50 STATES, GETS ITS OWN TOAST. USUALLY TO GET YOUR OWN BREAD ITEM YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. FRANCE, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TOAST. ENGLAND HAS A MUFFIN. SPAIN SETTLED FOR AN OMLETTE. [LAUGHING] I'M REALLY JUST TRYING TO CONNECT ON A LOCAL LEFT. BUT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ABOUT TEXAS. WHETHER IT'S TOAST OR AS OUR JASON JONES FOUND OUT, POLITICS.
WITH MIDTERM ELECTIONS JUST AROUND THE BEND, WE CAME TO THE LONE STAR STATE TO SEE WHAT ISSUE IS NUMBER ONE. AND TOP OF THE HEAP IS.
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
WE'VE GOT TO SECURE OUR BORDERS.
STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH. THEY'RE RIGHT ON THE BORDER, SO THE MOST IMPORTANT TO TEXAS-SIZED ISSUE OF COURSE IS:
ACCESS TO SAFE LEGAL ABORTIONS AND HAVING CONTROL OF THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.
WAIT, HOLD ON, I THOUGHT IT WAS --
I WANT PEOPLE TO REALLY FOCUS ON DEATH PENALTY, OF COURSE.
OH COME ON, THAT TOO.
GAY RIGHTS.
GAY RIGHTS.
IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL IN THE STATE OF TEXAS TO FIRE SOMEONE FOR NO OTHER REASON THEN THEY'RE GAY OR TRANSGENDER.
LET ME GUESS, LEGALIZING WEED.
NO SECESSION.
OH [BLEEP].
IT'S ABOUT PRO-CHOICE. WE ARE PRO-CHOICE.
YOU ARE PRO-CHOICE?
GUNS. I'M PRO-CHOICE ON WHETHER I CAN CARRY OR NOT.
I'M SORRY, I'M JUST VERY CONFUSED. TEXAS IS A VERY MESSY PLACE. PRO-CHOICE IN TEXAS MEANS THE RIGHT TO CARRY.
YES. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE OTHER SATES.
WHAT THE [BLEEP]? IT SEEMS LIKE TEXAS IS THE EPICENTER OF EVERY SINGLE NATIONAL ISSUE.
THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE'RE DEALING WITH IS ACTUALLY HOW TO PROPERLY CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH EBOLA, SO YOU DON'T AFFECT -- WHAT?
I TOTALLY FORGOT YOU GUYS HAVE EBOLA.
YEAH. AND IT'S VERY SERIOUS.
OH MY GOD. THIS IS MAKING ME SO SAD.
