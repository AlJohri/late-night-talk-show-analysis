Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. OH, OUR GUEST TONIGHT, A  GOOD ONE, TV JOURNALIST,  CO-FOUNDER THE BOB WOODRUFF  FOUNDATION, BOB WOODRUFF, HE'LL BE JOINING US. NOW OBVIOUSLY NEW YORK STILL  REELING FROM THE AFFECTS OF  THE SUPERSTORM THIS WHOLE  REGION. THINGS ARE GETTING BACK TO  NORMAL IN SMALL MEASURES. THIS MORNING, IN FACT, CRAZY  PERSON WAS OUTSIDE MY WINDOW  YELLING WE'RE ALL GOING TO  DIE! AND IT WAS MAYOR BLOOMBERG  WAS-- IT WAS HIM. (LAUGHTER)  AND HE WASN'T TALKING ABOUT  THE STORM. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT  TRANSFATS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT SO EVERYTHING SEEMS TO  BE COMING AROUND. (LAUGHTER)  I'M ACTUALLY SO PROUD OF  THIS AREA. STILL VERY THANKFUL TO BE IN  SOGGY PORTION WE ARELESS NEW  YORK. BECAUSE, AND THIS IS TRUE,  YOU HAVE TO KEEP PERSPECTIVE  N SOMEPLACES IN THIS COUNTRY,  IT'S EVEN WORSE.
THE CANDIDATES ARE  SPENDING SO MUCH TIME HERE  IT'S AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT OF OHIO.
RESIDENTS ARE FACING A  DAILY ONSLAUGHT OF CAMPAIGN  ADS, NEWS STORIES, ROBO  CALLS AND MAILERS.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE  HELLISH POST APOCALYPTIC  REALITY WHERE ALL YOU SEE  ARE POLITICAL ADS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IMAGINE IT? I WROTE A SCREENPLAY ABOUT  IT. CLEVELANDFIELD. (LAUGHTER)  JK AN RAMS. SANDY HAS DEVASTATED OUR  REGION BUT AT LEAST WE DON'T  LIVE IN SWING STATE HELL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S SAD THAT IS WHAT WE  DID IN THIS BUILDING HERE  WITH THE ELECTRICITY THAT WE  HAVE. (LAUGHTER)  PEOPLE DOWNTOWN ARE DRINKING  THEIR OWN URINE AND WE'RE UP  HERE. FOR WHATEVER REASON BOTH  CAMPAIGNS HAVE CRUNCHED THE  NUMBERS, STUDIED THIS  ELECTION'S METRICS AND  DECIDED THAT THE ONLY ELECTORAL VOTES OF  CONSEQUENCE IN 2012 ARE THE  18 THAT RESIDE IN THE GREAT  STATE OF OHIO. WHILE THE REST OF US ARE  FREE TO PURSUE WORK, FAMILY,  RECREATION, OHIOANS MUST  RECONCILE THEIR ROLE AS THIS YEAR'S --.
THERE'S MORE MONEY BEING  SPENT ON POLITICAL ADS IN  OHIO THAN IN ANY OTHER STATE. 181 MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR,  IN COLUMBUS, MORE THAN 6600  ADS JUST THIS MONTH. THAT'S 333 A DAY. FOR SUE AND JACK McKITTRICK  OF DUBLIN, OHIO, THE BARRAGE  BEGINS BEFORE DAY BREAK. SHE'S UNDECIDED. HE SUPPORT AS ROMNEY.
THE ADS ARE CONTINUOUSLY  FROM 5:00 IN THE MORNING  UNTIL WE GO TO BED AT NIGHT.
Jon: AND THAT'S WHEN THE  DREAM ADS START. (LAUGHTER)  ARE YOU HAPPY O BAMA AND  ROMNEY! YOU'RE KILLING THE  McKITTRICKS! YOU KNOW THEY JUST GOT  MARRIED THREE MONTHS AGO. (LAUGHTER)  AND NOW LOOK AT THEM! THEY'RE IN THEIR MID 20s. YOU'RE KILLING THEM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THESE OHIO POLITICAL ADS ZAP  YOUR YOUTH, THEY DRAIN YOUR  VIGOR. OUT OF THE SAME HOLE THEY  USED TO ZAP YOUR YOUTH. THE CLOACA I THINK IT'S  CALLED.
OBAMA TOOK GM AND  CHRYSLER INTO BANKRUPTCY AND  SOLD CHRYSLER TO ITALIANS  WHO ARE GOING TO BUILD JEEPS IN CHINA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SOLD CHRYSLER TO  ITALIANS WHAT, WE'RE AFRAID  OF ITALIANS NOW?
IF OBAMA WINS, IT WILL BE  THE POPE DECIDING WHAT YOU  DRIVE. (LAUGHTER)  ONE DAY THEY'RE RUINING OUR  CAR COMPANIES, THE NEXT DAY  THEY'LL BE KISSING OUR  DAUGHTERS WITH THEIR GARLICKY LIPS. (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, APPARENTLY THE  CLASSIC ITALIANS ARE GOING  TO MOVE AMERICAN JEEPS  MAKING JOBS TO CHINA. WHY YOU SAY THESE THINGS,  MITT ROMNEY. KUZ NOW I GOTTA MAKEA THE  NICE PEOPLE OF OHIO SAY  ANOTHER AD SAYING THAT'S [BLEEP].
AFTER ROMNEY'S FALSE  CLAIM OF JEEP OUTSOURCING TO  CHINA CHRYSLER ITSELF HAS  REFUTED ROMNEY'S LIE.
Jon: HOW OUT THERE IS  MITT ROMNEY, I A CAR COMPANY,  THE PEOPLE WHO CONVINCE YOU  YOU NEED THE UNDERCOATING ARE COMING AFTER HIM FOR HIS  DISHONESTY. (LAUGHTER)  YOU MIGHT SAY WELL HEY, WHY  DON'T THEY JUST TURN OFF THE  TV AND LEAVE THE HOUSE AND  LIVE THEIR LIFE.
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HIDE,  BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES ARE [BLEEP] EVERYWHERE.
IT'S GOODS NOBODY TOLDO,  OHIO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH,  LEBANON.
YOUNGSTOWN.
BOWLING GREEN.
CLEVELAND.

ZAINESVILLE.
HELLO CINCINNATI! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HELLO NORMALTON,  MIDDLESBERG, AVERAGEVILLE,  EACH UNDECIDED INDEPENDENT  VOTERSBURRY. VAGISIL, COMPTON, I  DON'T-- SITTING THROUGH THE  POLICY SPEECHES, THAT'S ONE  THING. BUT IT'S THE RELATING TO  YOU. THE NEVER ENDING INCESSANT  RELATING TO YOU.
OUR PART OF WISCONSIN IS  JUST LIKE THIS PART OF OHIO.
THIS LOOKS JUST LIKE  WHERE I COME FROM. TOLEDO AND JANESVILLE HAVE A  LOT IN KMON.
JANESVILLE IS NOT THAT  DIFFERENT FROM ZAINESVILLE.
WHERE I COME FROM.
IT'S SO SIMILAR TO RIGHT  HERE IN NEW PHILADELPHIA.
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IS  FROM AGO RON.
OH, REALLY? -- .
Jon: ONE OF MY BEST  FRIENDS IS FROM AKRON. I WOULD LET MY DAUGHTER GO  OUT WITH SOMEONE FROM AKRON. WELL, IF THAT WAS TRUE WITH  YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THEY  PREFER TO BE CALLED  AKRO-AMERICANS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT  YOUR FORCED FUN.
O-H.
I-O.
O-H.

OH REASON IO REASON GOD I  LOVE THAT THAT'S SO FUN.
Jon: YEAH, IT'S NOT THAT  FUN. YOU YELL TWO LETTERS AT THEM,  AND THEN THEY YELL TWO BACK. AND ONE OF THEM IS THE SAME  LETTER. (LAUGHTER)  OUR CITY HAS GOT A WAY  BETTER CALL AND RESPONSE  THING. NEW YORK! [BLEEP] YOURSELF.
FOR MORE WE GO OUT TO  WYATT CENAC REPORTING FROM A  SECURE UNDERGROUND BUNKER IN  YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO. WYATT, TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE  IN OHIO ARE SURVIVING? IS THERE ANY WAY FOR OHIOANS  TO AVOID THESE ADS?
JON, THE ADVERTISING  ONSLAUGHT HERE HAS BEEN  DEVASTATING. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TAKEN  SHELTER IN THIS UNDERGROUND  BUNKER BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE  BEEN HEARING ON THE OUTSIDE, TRAGICALLY ALMOST 99% OF THE  POPULATION HERE IN OHIO  STILL HAS ELECTRICITY. IT'S HORRIBLE.
Jon: HAVE AUTHORITIES  SAID WHEN THEY MIGHT CUT  POWER AND GET SOME RELIEF TO  THESE FOLKS?
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN  PROMISED RELIEF BY WEDNESDAY,  BUT WHO KNOWS. I MEAN ELECTORAL COLLEGE  TIES, WIN THE POPULAR VOTE.
Jon: A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO,  IT IS A TRAGIC, TRAGIC  SITUATION.
IT'S NOT ALL BAD, JON. THERE IS A REAL SENSE OF  COMMUNITY OUT HERE AMONGST  THE SUFFERING. I MEAN NEIGHBORS ARE HELPING  NEIGHBORS STACK SAND BAGS TO  HOLD BACK THE CAMPAIGN AD  ONSLAUGHT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
HUDDLING TOGETHER AROUND  WI-FI DEAD SPOTS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SOME JUST TO AVOID  GETTING PHONE CALLS HAVE  EVEN TAKEN THE EXTREME  MEASURES OF SWITCHING TO  AT&T.
Jon: OH DEAR LORD! OH MY-- OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD --
BUT JON.
Jon: IT'S LIKE THEY ARE  NOT EVEN LIVING IN A  SOCIETY!
NO, NO BUT KNOW WHAT,  EVEN WHEN THE TV ADS SUBSIDE  T WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO  CLEAN UP THE DEBRIS COVERING THE STATE.
Jon: IS THERE ANY WAY TO  JUST AVOID THE ADS?
NO, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. LAST NIGHT I WAS FAST  FORWARDING THROUGH  COMMERCIALS AND IT STILL  DIDN'T HELP. (LAUGHTER)  OBAMA'S MAKING JEEPS IN  CHINA, JERRY!
Jon: WYATT, I THINK AN  EVACKIATION ORDER HAS TO BE  ISSUED. THESE PEOPLE NEED TO  EVACUATE.
WHERE DO THEY VACKIATION,  JON, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN?
Jon: MAYBE.
NO-- .
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
SORRY, IT'S TOUGH TO  BREATHE IN THAT BUNKER.
Jon: THE OXYGEN IN THAT  BUDGET CERTIFICATE TERRIBLE.
TOTALLY.
Jon: WYATT, ARE YOU IN A  BUNKER, THE OXYGEN GETS BAD.
WOULD YOU THINK SOMEBODY  WOULD FEBREZE THIS PLACE.
Jon: I KNOW. WHY CAN'T THEY-- WHY CAN'T  THEY-- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I  SAW THEY HAD WATER DOWN  THERE. (LAUGHTER)
HOLY CRAP THERE'S WATER  IN HERE.
Jon: I BET THERE IS WATER  IN THE BUDGETER.
THERE'S WATER IN HERE OH,  COME DOWN WITH THAT WATER. (LAUGHTER)  I THREW IT ON A SHELF, I  THINK THERE WAS A SHELF  THERE.
Jon: IT JUST FELL OFF THE--   (LAUGHTER)  SO-- SO GETTING BACK TO  THIS --.
I MEAN THEY CAN'T GO TO  MITCH PITCH IF THAT IS WHAT  YOU WERE SUGGESTED.
Jon: OH, RIGHT, MICHIGAN,  AMISH COUNTRY IS NEARBY.
