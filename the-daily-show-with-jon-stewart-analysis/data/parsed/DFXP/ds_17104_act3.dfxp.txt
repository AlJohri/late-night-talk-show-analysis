CHAWDZ.
Jon: WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING TO FIRST LADY "AMERICAN GROWN." GETTING YOUR KIDS HEALTHIER, INVOLVED WITH EXERCISE. IT'S INTERESTING TO ME YOU AS FIRST LADY YOU HAVE AN APPROVAL RATING OF 85% TO 90%. IT'S NOT THAT HIGH.
Jon: IT'S THROUGH THE ROOF.
YOU EXAGGERATE.
Jon: BUT IT IS. YOU ARE ICE CREAM --
HE'S VEGETABLES.
Jon: MY POINT IS --  [ LAUGHTER ] FORGET POLL TIKDZ OR ANY OF THAT IN JUST MARITAL RELATIONSHIP IN JUST ARGUING, HOW DO YOU NOT USE THAT? [ LAUGHTER ] AND WIELD IT -- IF I HAD AN 80% APPROVAL RATING AND MY WIFE WAS AT 50% I'D BE LIKE REALLY? BECAUSE THE PEOPLE SAY --  [ LAUGHTER ] DOES THAT EVER --
NO, NO, I DON'T WIELD IT OVER HIM. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. I'VE SEEN WHAT IT TAKES TO BE PRESIDENT. I KIND OF WATCH THIS THING PRETTY CLOSELY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING ALL THE HARD DECISIONS WHERE THERE'S NO EASY ANSWER. THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF THAT COMES ACROSS HIS DESK. REALLY WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT WHEN YOU ARE MAKING JUDGMENT CALLS, ALL YOU HAVE IS YOUR  CHARACTER, YOUR VALUE, YOUR VISION FOR THIS COUNTRY. I SEE HIM BEING SO CONSISTENT IN DISREGARDING THE CHATTER AND THE NOISE AND REALLY MOVING FORWARD  TOWARDS A COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S MORE EQUITY, MORE FAIRNESS, WHERE OUR KIDS GROW UP IN SCHOOLS THAT EDUCATE THEM. WHERE THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES.
Jon: HAVE YOU SEEN HIM CHANGE IN HIS DECISION-MAKING AS THE GRAVITY HAS -- DID IT START  OUT MORE DART BOARD-ISH AND THEN MOVE? RIGHT EXACTLY?
NEVER, NEVER.
Jon: NEVER.
IN FACT THE HARDER DECISIONS HE HAS BEEN SO CONSISTENT. HE TOLD AMERICA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO. PASS HEALTH CARE, MAKE SURE THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND OUR KIDS CAN  START THEIR LIVES WITH INSURANCE AS OPPOSED TO GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE WITHOUT INSURANCE. HE ENDED THE WAR IN IRAQ. BROUGHT OUR TROOPS HOME, MAKING SURE THEY GET THE BENEFITS AND RESPECT THAT THEY'VE EARNED.
Jon: ARE YOU -- ARE YOU -- BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I WAS NOT -- I HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOWING THIS. ARE THERE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT SAYS I COULD DO THAT JOB.
SEVEN LIKE GLAD I DON'T HAVE THAT JOHN.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT BIDEN, JOE? [ LAUGHTER ] EVER THINK LIKE --
I LOVE JOE.
Jon: I LOVE JOE, TOO. IS IT HARD TO RAISE A KID AROUND BIDEN? BECAUSE I WOULD ASSUME --  [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S A LOT OF LIKE JOE, LANGUAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] OR LIKE HE'S LIKE THE UNCLE THAT COMES OVER LIKE OH, YOU BROUGHT SOME GUNS. THAT KIND OF THING S. THAT -- -- IS THAT SOMETHING --
NO, NO HE'S A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT AND HE'S A GREAT FRIEND.
Jon: THAT'S NICE.
MY KIDS HANG AROUND HIM AND I'M GOOD WITH IT.
Jon: WE ARE READING STORIES ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.
WHAT WAS HE DOING?
Jon: WHAT IS THAT THE SCRIPT OF A CHEECH AND CHONG MOVIE. WHEN YOU MET HIM DID YOU PUT THE CIE BASH --
HE WAS LIKE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. HE REALIZED HE HE WITH DO MORE. YOU ARE HIS MOTHER SAID YOU ARE SO GIFTED, SO TALENT. SLAP HIM ON THE HEAD AND SAY GET YOURSELF TOGETHER. HE LOST HIS FATHER THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS. HE TRANSFERRED SCHOOLS WENT TO COLUMBIA AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO USE HIS LIFE TO THE FULLEST. THAT WAS BEFORE ME.
Jon: INTERESTING. THIS PRESIDENT, GEORGE W. BUSH WENT THROUGH HIS TIMES WHERE HE WAS A LITTLE BIT OUT THERE. I REALLY RELATED TO THAT. IT'S THE TURN AROUND -- THAT'S THE PART WHERE I'M --
I'M NOT TAKING ANY BAIT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT'S ORGANIC. I SEE WHAT THIS MAN SEES IN YOU. YOU DID VERY GOOD. JUST SAYING NEED A LITTLE HELP OUT THERE. GET OUT THERE.
PLANT A GARDEN. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO START.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE. FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. [CHEERS A
