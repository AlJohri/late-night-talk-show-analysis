TONIGHT IS A DOCUMENTARY  FILMMAKER THE LATEST FILM IS  SHOWTIME'S "THE WORLD ACCORDING TO DICK CHENEY."
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DRAWING A  LINE YOU DON'T CONSIDER A  PROLONGED PERIOD OF CREATING THE SENSATION OF DROWNING SHALL YOU  DON'T CONSIDER TORTURE.
I DON'T KNOW. TELL ME WHAT TERRORIST ATTACKS  YOU WOULD HAVE LET GO FORWARD  BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE A MEAN AND NASTY FELLOW. ARE YOU GOING TO PRAY THE LIVES  OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO  PRESERVE YOUR HONOR. ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOUR JOB TO  SAFEGUARD THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA AND THE LIVES OF ITS  CITIZENS.
Jon: MUST HAVE BEEN A FUN  WEEKEND. PLEASE WELCOME R.J. CUTLERMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOW! WOW. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT  HAUNTING MUSIC DOES THAT JUST  PLAY WHEN HE IS AROUND?
IT DOES, YEAH. AMAZING. SAVES YOU A LOT OF MONEY ON A  SCORE.
Jon: SURE. CAN I IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE THE  CASE. HOW LONG DID YOU SPEND WITH THE  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT?
WELL, I MET HIM OVER A LUNCH  TO DISCUSS THE PROJECT ONE  AFTERNOON AND THEN FOR THE INTERVIEWS I WAS WITH HIM FOUR  DAYS, FIVE HOURS A DAY, 20  HOURS. ON THE FIFTH DAY HE INVITED US  TO GO FLY FISHING.
Jon: IS THAT -- ASSUMING  WHEN THEY KILL YOU AND THREE  YOUR BODY IN THE RIVER. IT SOUNDS LIKE GODFATHER WE'VE  HAD OUR INTERVIEW, COME TO MY  BOAT. [ LAUGHTER ] OBVIOUSLY THERE IS AN  EXPECTATION IN THE AUDIENCE IN  GENERAL THAT YOU WILL TELL IT. IT'S AGAINST THE CODE.
DIFFERENT FILMMAKERS WOULD  APPROACH IT DIFFERENTLY. FOR ME THE FILM IS BUILT AROUND  HIS VOICE. THE IDEA BEHIND THE FILM IS THAT  THIS MAN IS ONE OF THE MOST  IMPACTFUL AND VOICE THIS COUNTRY HAS KNOWN. THERE'S DETACTORS AND SUPPORTERS  WHOSE VOICES ARE ALSO HEARD. THE IDEA, AND HOW I GOT HIM TO  PARTICIPATE IS SAYING I WANT TO  BUILD THIS AROUND YOUR VOICE. MY YELLING AT HIM WAS NOT GOING  TO GET US WHERE WE WANTED TO  GET. YOU DON'T GET THE CLIP THAT YOU  JUST HEARD THAT YOU PITS HONOR  AGAINST DUTY AND DISMISSES HONOR AS A VALUE.
Jon: HE SEEMS TO THROUGHOUT  THE FILM SAYS THE CHOICE SEEMS  TO BE, I HAD A CHOICE, I COULD EITHER BE LOVED OR DO WHAT IS  RIGHT. THERE WAS A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE  YOU COULD NOT NECESSARILY BE  LOVED BUT NOT (bleep) SO BAD. HE DOESN'T SEEM TO CONSIDER  THAT.
HE IS NOT A MAN IN RETREAT. AND HE IS A POLITICIAN OF TOTAL  CONVICTION. ONE OF THE THEMES THE FILM  EXPLORES IS WHAT -- WE'RE  ATTRACTED TO POLITICIANS OF CONVICTION, IT MAKES THE  DEMOCRACY RUN. WE NEED PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN  THINGS BUT THERE'S A LIMIT AND  WHERE DOES IT CROSS THE LINE TO WHEN IT BECOMES SOMETHING ELSE.
Jon: I'M INTERESTED IN HIS  CERTAINTY. THERE'S A POINT IN THE MOVIE  WHERE YOU SAY TO HIM, HE'S GOING  THROUGH THE DATING PHASE REALLY WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR? WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE FOOD? WHAT IS YOUR WORST QUALITY AND  HE'S STUMPED. HE'S HITTING THE ANSWERS LIKE  SPAGHETTI, BLUE, I SEE A TURTLE,  YOU KNOW LIKE -- [LAUGHTER] HE'S HITTING IT ALL. BUT WHIT GETS TO NAME A BAD  QUALITY HE'S LIKE --
YEAH. AND INTERESTINGLY WHEN HE SAW  THE FILM THAT WAS THE MOMENT --  HE WAS HAPPY THAT I HAD CHOSEN TO INCLUDE THAT. SOMETHING HE RESPONDED TO.
Jon: THAT YOU COULDN'T SAY  ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HIM.
THE EXAMINATION OF HIS FLAWS  IS NOT SOMETHING ESSEN GAUGED  IN.
Jon: WHAT IS STUNG IS THE  CERTAINTY OF HIS  DECISION-MAKING. HE HAS NO SENSE THAT EXAMINATION  OF PAST MISTAKES MUST INFORM  FUTURE DECISIONS. HE JUST PRETENDS AS THOUGH -- I  COULD EITHER LOOK BACK AND  CORRECT SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE DONE OR BE LOVED. I CHOSE -- HE KEEPS SETTING UP  THESE WEIRD STRAW MEN.
IT'S STARTLING IN ITS  SIMPLICITY AND CLARITY. BUT I THINK IT'S MORE  COMPLICATED THAN HE LETS ON. HE SAID IF YOU WANT TO BE LOVED  BE A MOVIE STAR. I DIDN'T DO IT TO BE LOVED BUT  THEN HERE NECESSARY A MOVIE. WE MADE A MOVIE AND HE  PARTICIPATED.
Jon: DO YOU THINK HE DOES  WANT AFFECTION? DOES HE WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED? DOES HE WANT TO BE REWARDED ON A  MAINSTREAM LEVEL? DO YOU THINK THAT IS THERE?
IT'S HARD TO KNOW. I THINK HE'S OBVIOUSLY  INTERESTED IN HIS LEGACY. HE IS REDEFINING WHAT A VICE  PRESIDENT DOES AFTER HIS  ADMINISTRATION --
Jon: HE HAD THIS WHOLE  THING THAT HE EXISTS IN THE  VAPORS OF OUR GOVERNMENT. IT WAS CRAZY.
IT WAS A WHOLE NEW WAY OF  SEEING THE ROLE BOTH IN OFFICE  AND AFTERWARDS. HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK, HE IS  WRITING ANOTHER BOOK. HOW HISTORY SEES HIM.
Jon: WAS THERE ANY MOMENT  OF INSECURITY THAT YOU SAW? DOES THESE PANTS MAKE ME LOOK  FAT? ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
MOMENTS TALKING ABOUT HIS  YOUTH AND WHEN HE WENT OFF --
Jon: WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. CAN YOU STICK AROUND? APPEARS ON SHOWTIME MARCH 15.
