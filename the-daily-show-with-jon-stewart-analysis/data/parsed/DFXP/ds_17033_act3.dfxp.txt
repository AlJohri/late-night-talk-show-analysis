(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A CHEF. SHE HOSTS THE FOOD NETWORK'S SECRETS OF A RESTAURANT CHEF. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED COOK LIKE A ROCK STAR. 125 RECIPES AND CULINARY SECRETS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ANN BURRELL. HELLO. VERY NICE. NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR JOINING US. COOK LIKE A ROCK STAR. FIRST OF ALL, LET ME TELL YOU THIS. VERY NICE. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. I'M WATCHING THE IRON CHEF SUPER CHEFS. YOU WERE IN THERE. A COUPLE OF WEEKS YOUR SARDINE SPINE CRISPEES WITH THE TOUR EVEN OF SARDINE AND SARDINE  SOUP I WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT.
THE WAY YOU SPIN IT MAKES IT SOUND SO DELICIOUS. HOW DID YOU NOT GET KICKED OFF.
Jon: IT LOOKS DELICIOUS. I WAS UPSET THAT YOU GOT KICKED OFF ON THAT ONE.
I HAVE TO SAY I HAVE BEEN UPSET FOR MONTHS THAT I GOT KICKED OFF. IT'S JUST SO HARD WHEN PEOPLE COME TO ME ON THE STREET, COME ON. IN MY HEART, IT'S BREAKING. IT'S LIKE I'M NOT. THEY'RE LIKE IF YOU DON'T WIN I'M GOING TO BE... I'M LIKE BUT I DIDN'T.
Jon: THAT SHOW IS INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY DO. OKAY, CHEFS. CLIMB A BUILDING. ON THE OUTSIDE.
CLIMB A BUILDING ON THE OUTSIDE. THERE IS A POPSICLE STICK AND A PIECE OF DENTAL AND A STICK OF GUM AND MAKE SOMETHING  DELICIOUS IN TEN SECONDS.
Jon: THEY HAVE THE ENGLISH GUY WHO IS LIKE YOUR CRUDEAU IS WELL FORMULATED AND IT'S  YELLOW, MY WORST FAVORITE COLOR.
IT IS A LITTLE RAW. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS. DARLING.
Jon: IS IT? I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS, RAW.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHAT THE FOOD CHANNEL HAS DONE TO ME AND TO MY CHILDREN. IT HAS INSTILLED IN THEM THE IDEA THAT IF I PREPARE A MEAL FOR THEM THAT THEY DON'T LIKE, I CAN BE SENT AWAY. THAT IS A TERRIBLE... BECAUSE I WILL MAKE LIKE SCRAMBLED EGGS IN THE MORNING. MY SON WILL BE LIKE, CHEF, I LIKE A CONSISTENCY... I'M AFRAID YOU'VE BEEN CHOPPED.
IT WAS LIKE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN MY HOUSE IT'S LIKE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, WELL, I'M GOING TO SET THE TIMER. EAT IT. IF YOU STILL DON'T LIKE IT, STUFF IT. DONE.
Jon: ARE CHEFS A COMPETITIVE LOT? I'VE BEEN SURPRISED AT JUST HOW UPSET AND DEEPLY THE CHEFS ARE FEELING THIS COMPETITION.
I HAVE TO SAY THIS WAS INCREDIBLY HARD. I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN IN COMPETITIONS. I'VE BEEN ON IRON CHEF. I'VE BEEN MARIO'S CHEF FOR YEARS. I WAS ON CHOPS. I GOT CHOPPED. BUT I'M....
Jon: YOUR CRUDEAUX WAS MAGNIFICENT.
I HAD TO DO RETAIL THERAPY. I MEAN ALEX AND I ARE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS.
Jon: SHE IS ALSO TREMENDOUS WITH THE THING SHE DID WITH THE....
YES. SO, SHE AND I HAVE BEEN TEXTING BACK AND FORTH FOR MONTHS LIKE "AND THEN... WHAT  DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT" WATCHING IT AND DOING THE LIVE TWEETING. IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. VERY PERSONAL.
Jon: IT'S YOUR FOOD.
IT IS TRULY EXTREMELY HARD.
Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE. WHAT'S IMPRESSIVE TO ME IS WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD WHEN THEY SAY TO YOU LIKE  HERE'S YOUR INGREDIENTS. YOU HAVE CRAZY BLACK MOLD ON CORN.
MY FAVORITE.
Jon: AND A RAM'S ANUS.
THAT IS MY FAVORITE. I WOULD FEEL SO LUCKY IF I GOT THAT ONE.
Jon: WHAT IS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD? HOW DO YOU BREAK THAT DOWN?
IT'S AMAZING. LIKE EVERY TIME I'M IN ONE OF THESE LIKE COMPETITIONS I'M LIKE, OKAY, MY BRAIN WORKS SO FAST. IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE. I'M LIKE OH, YES, OF COURSE, I'M GOING TO WHIP THIS UP. YOU JUST GO AND DO IT. THE NEXT THING I KNOW I'M RUNNING AROUND GETTING POTS AND PANS AND COOKING SOMETHING. WHAT AM I MAKING? WHEN I GET TO THE END HOW DID I THINK ABOUT THAT.
Jon: DO YOU CATEGORIZE IT?
IT'S IN THE FORM OF A LOSS EVENING BUT IF I MAKE A SIMPLE  SYRUP IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A FEEL TO IT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD IDEA OF FOOD AND HOW IT GOES. IT'S LIKE HOW CAN I USE THAT IN A... YOU KNOW, A WAY THAT IF I PUT LIKE MAYBE AND THEN  YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU GET THAT AROMA.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE THE FEELING EVER LIKE I PREPARED LAMB ANUS WITH A THING AND THE  SUCRETS, HERE, TAKE THAT.
THAT'S THE WAY I FELT THE DAY I GOT SENT HOME.
Jon: I ENJOY WATCHING IT. IT'S A GREAT SHOW. THESE ARE SOME FINE RECIPES. COOK LIKE A ROCK STAR ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. NEXT YEAR I THINK....
I DON'T KNOW, NEXT YEAR I'M WORKING ON THE NEW SEASON  AGAINST BOBBY FLAY THIS YEAR. THEY'RE PUTTING ME UP IN THE BIG GIRL LEAGUES. I'M GOING FOR A 3-0 RECORD. WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES.
