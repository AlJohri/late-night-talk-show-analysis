WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A STAFF WRITER AT THE NEW YORKER. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE SIXTH EXTINCTION, AN UNNATURAL HISTORY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ELIZABETH KOLBERT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
PRETTY GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: VERY WELL, THANK YOU. THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE SIXTH EXTINCTION." THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE EXTINCTION EVENTS THUS FAR.
HERETOFORE, YEAH.
Jon: THOSE ARE WHAT? THE FIFTH AND MOST FAMOUS IS THE EXTINCTION THAT DID IN THE DINOSAURS.
Jon: THAT WAS AN ASTEROID.
THAT WAS AN ASTEROID.
Jon: AND PRIOR TO THAT WHAT HAD EXTINCTED THE ANIMALS?
A VARIETY OF THINGS EXTINCTED THE ANIMALS. THE FIRST IS 450 MILLION YEARS AGO BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED ABOUT A SUDDEN COLD SNAP.
Jon: POLAR VORTEX IF YOU WILL.
MAJOR, MAJOR POLAR VORTEX.
Jon: THE SIXTH EXTINCTION IS CAUSED BY AN INVASIVE SPECIES THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT. THAT WOULD BE US.
EXACTLY.
Jon: YOUR EARLY DESCRIPTION OF US REMINDED ME OF THE ASIAN CARP. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE ARE SIMILARITIES.
Jon: WE ARE INTRODUCED TO AN AREA AND WE IMMEDIATELY SPREAD OUT AND MAKE IT OUR OWN.
YEAH, WE'RE THE WORLD'S MOST SUCCESSFUL INVASIVE SPECIES. WE'VE GONE TO EVERY CONTINENT. STARTED OUT ON ONE CONTINENT AND NOW OCCUPY EVERY CLIMATE AND HABITAT THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. WE'RE THERE.
Jon: AND WE ARE, IN DOING SO, KILLING A LOT OF THINGS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THAT SEEMS TO BE AN UNFORTUNATE SIDE EFFECT.
Jon: NOW YOU HAVE -- THIS BOOK IS NOT MUSINGS ON THIS. THERE'S SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, IF YOU ARE TO BELIEVE SCIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
YES, I CHOSE TO GO WITH THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. I PREFER TO TEACH THE CONTROVERSY BUT OKAY.
AND I WAS REALLY FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GO OUT WITH A LOT OF REALLY WONDERFUL SCIENTISTS, TALENTED SCIENTISTS INCREDIBLY DEDICATED SCIENTISTS. SO WE WENT TO THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. I WENT TO THE AMAZON RAINFOREST AND THE TOP OF THE ANDES WITH GREAT FOLKS.
Jon: IN SOME RESPECTS IT TOOK A GIANT ASTEROID TO CAUSE AN EXTINCTION AND WE'RE DOING IT OURSELVES. IT'S IMPRESSIVE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
WE'RE DOING IT WITHOUT EVEN TRYING. WE HAVEN'T EVEN REALLY PUT OUR MINDS TO IT.
Jon: JUST THINK IF WE GOT TOGETHER AND THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S ONLY MAKE THOSE PLASTIC CANNED THINGS THAT TRAP DOLPHINS. LET'S ONLY MAKE THAT, REALLY FILL UP THE OCEAN WITH THEM.
EXACTLY THINK WHAT WE COULD DO.
Jon: IT'S INTERESTING THAT BIODIVERSITY AS YOU GET TOWARDS THE EQUATOR YOU WRITE A LOT ABOUT -- IN CANADA THERE'S A TREMENDOUS LAND MASS ONLY 20 SPECIES OF TREE BUT BELIZE HAS OVER -- WHAT IS IT -- 200?
YEAH, LIKE 700. THERE'S AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON WHICH YOU VISCERALLY SORT OF SEE IN THE TROPICS THAT THEY ARE WAY MORE DIVERSE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK IS WE ASSOCIATE CLIMATE CHANGE AS A PROBLEM THAT IS EFFECTING THE POLAR BEARS. WE ALWAYS SEE PICTURES OF THEM. I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE PROBLEMS OF POLAR BEARS.
Jon: AND ALSO SENSITIVE THEY GET DEPRESSED.
THEY DO. THEY ARE GREAT BEASTS.
Jon: YOU GIVE THEM A COKE THEY ARE FINE. [ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY. BUT, YOU KNOW, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY A PROBLEM OF -- A MORE MASSIVE PROBLEM ACTUALLY WHERE CREATURES ACTUALLY LIVE WHICH IS IN THE TROPICS AND THEY TEND TO LIVE IN A VERY NARROW RANGE. WHEN WE WERE IN THE ANDES WE WERE WALKING ALONG AND ONE OF THEM SAID TO ME PICK OUT A LEAF YOU'LL SEE IT FOR 100 YARDS OR SO THIS SHAPE OF LEAF THAT TREE HAS ONLY THIS RANGE.
YOU WRITE THERE'S A MIGRATION ALGORITHM OF 30 FEET PER -- WHAT IS THE --
30 FEET PER DAY.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO MIGRATE.
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE MARCHING TO KEEP UP WITH THE CLIMATE. THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING SO QUICKLY ALL THE SPECIES WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE MOVE EXACTLY NORTH.
Jon: IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF HOW JEWS GO WHEN THEY GET OLDER.
EXACTLY. DON'T GOOD TO FLORIDA. GO TO JERSEY.
Jon: MAYBE NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE NEW FLORIDA IN SOME RESPECTS. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.
EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THE OCEAN ISSUE IS THE ONE WHERE IT'S REALLY STARK, WHERE THE REEFS ARE THE RAIN FOREST OF THE SEA AND THEY ARE TURNING INTO PETRIFIED FORESTS.
YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF A DOWNER. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] REEFS TURN OUT TO BE -- THEY ARE BUILT BY THESE TINY LITTLE GELATINOUS CREATURES AND THEY HAVE TO PUT ON WEIGHT TO STAY EVEN. AS WE POLLUTE THE AIR WE'RE POURING ACID INTO THE WATER.
Jon: WE'RE ACIDIFYING. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MANY
Jon: WE'RE ACIDIFYING. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MANY ANTIDEPRESSANTS WE'RE PUTTING IN, COULDN'T THAT MAKE THEM LESS ANXIOUS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THE HABITAT.
MAYBE THERE'S AN NSF GRANT IN THERE FOR YOU, I THINK.
Jon: IN SOME WAYS THE STORY OF THIS IS BOOK IS JUST WHAT SERIAL KILLERS -- [LAUGHTER] ON A HOPEFUL NOTE.
YES.
Jon: WAS THERE A HELPFUL NOTE? I DID NOT SEE ONE.
I WAS WAITING FOR WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY.
Jon: I GOT TO THE END AND I WAS LIKE MY GUESS IS THERE'S AN EPILOGUE IN THERE. I LIKE TO THING THERE'S SORT OF A JON STEWARTIAN TOUCH THERE. THERE'S NO SUBJECT TOO GRIM WE CAN'T HAVE A LITTLE HUMOR.
Jon: EXACTLY. THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE THE EPITAPH OF THE PLANET. THE SIXTH EXTINCTION, ON THE SHELVES NOW PLEASE GET IT. ELIZABETH KOLBERT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
