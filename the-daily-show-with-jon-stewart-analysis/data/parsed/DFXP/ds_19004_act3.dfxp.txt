IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE. I'M SUCH A FAN OF THIS SHOW.
Jon: WE'RE DELIGHTED. YOUR FAMILY IS SO LOVELY, IT WAS TRULY, I MET YOUR DOG.
I LIVE IN NEW YORK, I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR DAYS, MY PARENTS DON'T MEET ME ANYWHERE TO DO ANYTHING, THEY ONLY COME HERE FOR YOU.
Jon: OH.
THEY WERE LIKE YOU ARE HERE, THAT'S NICE. WHERE'S JON.
Jon: YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION. YOU MAY LEAVE THEM HERE.
THEY BETTER BEHAVE.
Jon: NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL. IT IS SO NICE TO SEE YOU. THIS SHOW, THE WORD JUICY COMES TO MIND. THERE IS MORE THAT HAPPENS ON THIS SHOW IN A WEEK. YOU KNOW SHONDA WHIMS VERY WELL.
I DO.
Jon: SHE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL WRITER.
YEAH.
Jon: WHAT ARE THE TERRIBLE THINGS GOING ON IN HER BRAIN. I ALWAYS WANT TO CALL HER UP AND GO ARE YOU OKAY SHONDA.
I KEEP ASKING THE WRITERS WHAT DRUGS THEY ARE DOING IN THE WRITERS ROOM, AND DO THEY WANT TO SHARE, AND DON'T STOP. BECAUSE THE WRITING IS SO GOOD. IT'S CRAZY. WE THINK YOU ARE KIDDING ME. AND THEY'RE NOT BACKING DOWN IN THE THIRD SEASON. I KIND OF THOUGHT WE'LL SLOW DOWN NOW A LITTLE BIT. NO.
Jon: THERE'S PEOPLE --
SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIED SOME PEOPLE HATE EACH OTHER, THEN LOVE EACH OTHER AND THEN THEY DIE AGAIN. IT'S CRAZY.
Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
THEY GET PUT IN HOLES, THEN THEY KILL PEOPLE.
Jon: AND THEN THEY HAVE SEX AGAIN.
YES. IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY FUN SHOW NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT IN THAT FRAMEWORK.
Jon: IT'S REALLY FUN. IT'S FUN TO WATCH. BUT DO YOU-- DO PEOPLE FROM WASHINGTON.
YEAH.
Jon: EVER CALL YOU AND SAY YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT. IS THERE EVER ANY SENSE THAT THEY FEEL LIKE YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL THAT EPISODE, A TUESDAY.
IT'S WHEN WE, THE CAST, TONY GOLDMAN WHO PLAYS THE PRESIDENT ON THE SHOW, HE AND SHONDA AND I ALL WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT DINNER THIS PAST SPRING AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE, WE LOVE THE SHOW. WE FEEL THE SHOW, THE SHOW IS US. AND I THOUGHT THAT'S NOT GOOD. IT'S AWESOME THAT YOU ARE WATCHING BECAUSE YOU WATCH MEANS I HAVE A JOB. I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU IDENTIFY SO MUCH.
Jon: .
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE THOUGH, NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, THE OTHER PEOPLE.
Jon: THE ADMINISTRATION THEY SEEM BUTTONED UP IN A WAY --
THERE'S NO SCANDAL THERE.
Jon: THEY HAVE NO FUN.
NO, THEY HAVE FUN BUT IT'S-- .
Jon: DID CLINTON EVER COME OVER AND BE LIKE, I LIKE THAT SHOW. IS HE LIKE-- IS HE JUST --
SEND ME A DVD.
HE LIKES THE SHOW, YEAH.
Jon: I COULD SEE THAT.
LISTEN, WE HAVE PEOPLE BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE CAME UP TO ME LOVING THE SHOW. FORMER INTERNS AT THE WHITE HOUSE WERE LIKE WHO TOLD YOU THAT.
Jon: WOW.
UH-HUH NOT THIS ADMINISTRATION, AGAIN.
Jon: DO MANY OF THEM THINK LIKE THAT'S ABOUT ME OR DO THEY PULL YOU OVER AND SAY I KNOW WHAT THAT IS, THEY TRY TO NAME THE PEOPLE THAT ARE --
THEY DO.
Jon: THAT THESE ARE BASED ON.
YEAH.
Jon: .
Jon: BECAUSE THESE ARE-- SHE IS THE INSPIRATION.
I'M CAREFUL TO SAY SHE'S THE INSPIRATION, THE CHARACTER IS NOT BASED ON HER BECAUSE JUDY DID WORK IN THE FIRST BUSH WHITE HOUSE AND SHE NEVER HAD AN AFFAIR WITH THE FIRST GEORGE BUSH.
Jon: YES.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN BUT THE-- THE WORK LIFE OF-- BUT THE WORK LIFE OF THE CHARACTER IS VERY MUCH BASED ON HER WORK. AND SHE DOESN'T SHARE DETAILS  LIKE SHE'S REPRESENTED EVERYBODY FROM MONICA LEWINSKY TO MICHAEL VICK THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES. SHE MANAGES CRISIS. SO SHE DOESN'T TELL US THINGS ABOUT HER CLIENTS. BUT THE WRITERS WILL COME UP WITH CRAZY IDEAS AND THEN THEY SAY HOW WOULD YOU FIX IT. AND THEN SHE COMES IN AND HELPS THEM FIGURE OUT.
Jon: LET'S SAY A VICE PRESIDENT, I DON'T KNOW, KILLS A GUY FOR HAVING SEX WITH SOMEBODY HE KNOWS, HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED, WHERE SHE HAS TO SIT THERE, LIKE BLINK TWICE, THAT KIND OF THING
WELL, I-- .
Jon: HERE IS HOW I WOULD HYPOTHETICALLY FIX THAT.
TOTALLY, I DO A CONFERENCE CALL WITH HER FOR EVERY EPISODE BECAUSE I WANT TO BRING AS MUCH REALITY TO THE ROLL AS POSSIBLE. I SAY HEY, WHERE YOU ARE. AND SHE'S LIKE I CAN'T TELL YOU.
Jon: SUPER-- SUPERSECRET.
THAT MEANS YOU ARE IN COLOMBIA, I KNOW YOU ARE, SHE IS LIKE I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
Jon: IS IT ALWAYS COLOMBIA?
NO.
Jon: IT'S NOT ALWAYS COLOMBIA.
SOMETIMES IT'S ITS MIDDLE EAST, SOMETIMES IT'S OHIO, YEAH. OHIO IS-- .
Jon: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO GIVE AWAY FOR THIS YEAR'S, ANY LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A TEASER OR A SPOILER, PERHAPS, OR MAYBE THE WHOLE PLOT, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO TELL US IN PARTICULAR. IS THERE ANYTHING JUICY THAT YOU ARE REALLY LOVING RIGHT NOW?
I AM LOVING THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE REALLY GETTING A LOOK INTO MY CHARACTER'S BACK STORY. AND HISTORY INTO HOW SHE BECAME OLIVIA POPE. AND I USED TO THINK LIKE WOW, SHE IS A REALLY TOREMENTED PERSON. AND NOW WITH ALL THAT I KNOW ABOUT HER PAST I THINK THIS WOMAN SHOULD BE LIKE A DRUG ADDICT IN PRISON. HOW IS SHE SO POWERFUL AND SUCCESSFUL.
Jon: DRUG ADDICT IN PRISON, SEASON FOUR.
SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: IT IS A DELIGHT. THANKS FOR BRINGING YOUR FAMILY. SCANDAL, THURSDAY NIGHT
