WELCOME BACK. NOW IF YOU MISSED IT AND YOU  MOST CERTAINLY HAVE, CNN HAS  A NEW MORNING SHOW. NEW DAY WITH KATE BALDWIN  AND CHRIS CUOMO. AND LOTS OF CLEVER NEW WAYS  TO PACKAGE THE NEWS.
WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MUSIC  MEANS. IT'S TIME FOR THE ROCK BLOCK,  A QUICK ROUNDUP OF THE  STORIES WILL YOU BE TALK  ABOUT. FIRST UP.
LET'S ROCK IT.
OH YEAH! CNN'S GOT A ROCK BLOCK. IT'S TIME FOR THE STORIES  THAT ROCK! STORIES TO GET YOU PUMPED UP  IN THE MORNING! THROW AWAY YOUR COFFEE  MACHINE, YOU'RE TO THE GOING  TO NEED IT! THESE ARE GOING TO BE  STORIES LIKE KANGAROO  ARRESTED AFTER A BAR FIGHT. OR AXLE ROSE DRIVES MONSTER  TRUCK INTO THE HOOVER DAM. ARE YOU READY FOR SOME  ROCKIN STORIES! LET'S HIT IT. ONE, TWO, THREE!
IT'S RICKIN NEWS. FIRST, IMPOSING JOB CUTS AT  THE PENTAGON DEFENSE  SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL  CALLING FOR 20% REDUCTION OF SENIOR STAFF POST BILL  BILL-- MILITARY BY-- 2019.
WAIT WHAT? (LAUGHTER)  IS IT JUST ME OR IS THE NEWS  ABOUT 20% OF PENTAGON  EMPLOYEES GETTING LAID OFF DECIDEDLY UNROCKING. I MEAN UNLESS THEIR JOBS  WERE PUT INTO A MINIFRINGE  AND THEN THROWN OUT OF A  HOTEL WINDOW. COME ON, CNN THIS IS YOUR  ROCK BLOCK. IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING. I WANT TO SEE A STORY LIKE  LOOK OUT ARKANSAS, 50 TONS  OF COCAINE WAS JUST DUMP  MOOD YOUR WATER SUPPLY. I WANT TO HEAR A STORY  PEOPLE CAN GET PREGNANT TOO. ONE MORE TIME FROM THE TOP. ONE, TWO, THREE.
A STUDY OF U.S. MILITARY  VETERANS FOUND THAT THOSE  DIAGNOSED WITH FORMS-- MOST FORMS OF CANCER ARE FAR LESS  LIKELY TO DEVELOP ALZHEIMER  DISEASE. THOSE NUMBERS WENT EVEN  FURTHER DOWN FOR VETS WHO  RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY, I THINK WE CLEARLY  HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT  ROCKING IT MEANS. BECAUSE MINE INVOLVES  LEATHER PANTS AND CHAINSAWS. YOURS INVOLVES ALZHEIMER AND  CHEMOTHERAPY. DON'T YOU SEE WHAT YOU'VE  DONE HERE? BY PUTTING THOSE STORIES TO  A ROCK BEAT YOU'VE GOT THE  WORST OF BOTH WORLDS. YOU'VE SUCKED THE FUN OUT OF  ROCK AND 9 WEIGHT OUT OF  NEWS. IT'S LIKE WHAT THE BRITISH  PEOPLE DID TO FOOD. WE REMOVED BOTH THE FLAVOR  AND THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE. THAT'S RIGHT, CNN. THIS ROCK SEGMENT IS THE  NEWS EQUIVALENT OF BOILED  MEAT. JUST LIKE MOM USED TO MAKE. BUT LOOK, IT IS UNFAIR TO  JUST PICK ON CNN FOR THIS. ALL OF THE CABLE NETWORKS  NOW SEEM TO THINK YOU NEED A  HOT, THUMPING BEAT TO ABSORB BASIC INFORMATION.
FACTS SCALING NEW HEIGHTS  AS WE AWAIT EASTERNINGS OUT  FROM GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT. I'M CAMERON HALL, THE NEWS  NATION IS FOLLOWING TRAYVON  MARTIN'S FAMILIES, REQUESTS DIRECTED AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
AND NASA FORCED TO ABORT  A SPACE WALK AFTER SOMETHING  GOES VERY WRONG IN ORBIT.
THIS THERE IS PARODY AND  THEN THIS. A FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT  IN TIELAND GOES BY THE NAME  OF HITLER.
REALLY? HIP-HOP OVER A HITLER STORY. UNLESS YOU'RE ABOUT TO BREAK  A STORY ABOUT HOW THE FUHRER  DOES REGGAE THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T GO TOGETHER. LOOK, IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE  THAT CA COUGH NEWS KNOWS  HELPS HELP LEARN INFORMATION, LET ME LEARN FROM YOU  BECAUSE I HAVE NEWS YOU  BADLY NEED TO HEAR SET TO  MUSIC THAT WILL MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR  IT. DOW HEAR THAT MUSIC? THAT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR OUR  NEW SEGMENT, OF BAD NEWS CAN  BARELY HEAR.
NEWS FLASH, EDWARD R. MURROW IS ROLLING OVER IN  HIS GRAVE. THE NEWS IS NOT A NIGHTCLUB. AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE ABLE  TO DANCE TO THE LATEST-- COMING  AT-- WAS'S IN YOUR NETWORK IS LIKE I CAN READ THE  NEWSPAPER IN THE MIDDLE OF  THE-- IS THIS MUSIC HELPING  YOU ABSORB THE MESSAGE OF WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY? BECAUSE I CAN'T-- IS IT  ANNOYING?
