Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALISM PROFESSOR AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, ALSO AN AUTHOR. HIS LATEST BOOK IS CALLED "LOST IN SHANGRI-LA: A TRUE STORY OF  SURVIVOR, ADVENTURE AND THE MOST INCREDIBLE RESCUE STORY OF WORLD WAR II."  PLEASE WELCOME MITCHELL ZUCKOFF. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY. "LOST IN SHANGRI-LA" ABOUT SOME SOLDIER CENTERS WORLD WAR II WHO  ARE STRANDED IN NEW GUINEA AFTER A PLANE CRASH.
YES.
Jon: NOW YOU CAME ACROSS THIS WHEN YOU WERE READING AN ARTICLE IN AN OLD NEWSPAPER.
CORRECT.
Jon: WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHERE PEOPLE READ NEWSPAPERS? [LAUGHTER]
OH, IT WAS VERY EXCITING FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.
Jon: SURE, SURE.
IT WAS LIKE GOING IN A TIME CAPSULE.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY, YES.
WONDERFUL.
Jon: SO 20... HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE ON THE PLANE?
24.
Jon: 21 OF THEM PASSED AWAY.
THAT'S CORRECT. SO 24 PEOPLE GET ABOARD THE GREMLIN SPECIAL LEAVING NEW GUINEA TOWARDS THE END OF WORLD WAR II.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE IDEA IS TO FLY OVER THIS VALLEY WHERE THEY DIDN'T KNOW A  VALLEY EXISTED UNTIL A YEAR BEFORE, HOPING TO SEE CANNIBAL TRIEDMEN, STONE-AGED CANNIBALS  LIVING IN A PRY IN ORDERRAL STATE. THE IDEA WAS A THREE-HOUR TOUR.
Jon: WHAT COULD GO WRONG WITH A THREE-HOUR TOUR? [LAUGHTER] PERFECT.
AND TRAGICALLY THE PLANE CRASHED, LEAVING ONLY THREE SURVIVORS.
Jon: SO THE SURVIVORS ARE VERY FEARFUL THAT THEY'RE ABOUT  TO ENCOUNTER HEAD HUNTERS AND CANNIBALS THAT ARE OF LEGEND SEVEN FEET TALL.
YES. SEVEN FEET TALL, SIN UIE EXAMPLES OF MANHOOD GROWING PIGS THE SIZE OF PONIES AND DOING  HUMAN SACRIFICES.
Jon: AND THEY RUN INTO GUYS MY SIZE.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: WHO ARE NAKED.
BUT THEY'RE NOT TOTALLY NAKED. THEY WORE GOURDS COVERING THEIR GENITALS.
Jon: YES, YOU WERE KIND ENOUGH TO BRING ONE. DID YOU TRAVEL TO NEW GUINEA?
I DID, I DID.
Jon: THIS IS SOMETHING YOU BROUGHT BACK? IS THIS A USED GENITAL GOURD?
NO, NO.
Jon: SO THIS IS FOR YOU, JON. THIS IS FOR ME? WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, A CONGRESSMAN? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, THIS IS HONESTLY, IT'S A LITTLE BOASTFUL, NO? IT'S A LITTLE LIKE...
I TOLL THEM IT WAS FOR YOU. YOU'RE VERY BIG IN NEW GUINEA.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S VERY EXCITING. THANK GOD BECAUSE IN MY HOUSE I USE PEANUT SHELLS. SO THEY HAVE THESE GOURDS. NOW, WHY DIDN'T... WHAT DID THE TRIBE IN NEW GUINEA THINK OF THESE THREE PALE-SKINNED INTERLOPERS? WHAT DID THEY THINK THEY WERE?
WELL, FORTUNATELY FOR THEM THEY REALIZED THEY WERE NOT THEIR ENEMIES. THEY HAD IN THEIR TRIBE A LEGEND. IT WAS A PROPHESY THAT SAID, SOME DAYLIGHT-SKINNED GHOSTS WOULD COME FROM DOWN A ROPE FROM THE SKY. AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THESE THREE SURVIVORS WERE THE FULFILLMENT OF THAT PROPHESY. SO AS A RESULT THAT'S WHY THEY WEREN'T EATEN RIGHT AWAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID THE PEOPLE, THE LIGHT-SKINNED PEOPLE, WHY DIDN'T  THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERED GODS FROM THE SKY, BECAUSE IN THE  BOOK THEY JUST KIND OF NOD AND ARE THANKFUL NOT TO BE EATEN, BUT BOY IS THAT AN OPPORTUNITY THAT DOES NOT COME AROUND VERY OFTEN.
SURE. THEY DIDN'T REALIZE IT. THEY COULDN'T COMMUNICATE WITH THESE TRIBES PEOPLE, AND SO THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT THEY WERE  BEING LEFT ALONE AND BEING PROVIDED FOR AND THEY WERE LOOKING AFTER THEM WHILE THE  ARMY WAS SCRAMBLING TRYING TO FIGURE OUR HOW THE RESCUE THEM.
Jon: MEANWHILE, THE ARMY FINDS THEM, BUT THEY CAN'T GET  TO THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF UNCHARTERED... SO THEY DROP OTHER PEOPLE IN.
YES.
Jon: BUT THEN THEY CAN'T GET THOSE PEOPLE OUT.
IT'S AN ARMY PLAN, JON. SO THEY DROP 11 PARATROOPERS IN, LED BY A GUY WHO IS STILL AROUND, A 90-YEAR-OLD GUY EARL WALTER.
Jon: WHO IS LIKE SEVEN FEET TALL.
HE'S LIKE WHAT THEY THOUGHT THE CANNIBALS WOULD BE. AN EARL WALTER LEADS THIS TEAM IN TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE THOUSANDS OF STONE-AGED  CANNIBALS WHO LIVE THERE IN THIS VALLEY WHILE THE ARMY IS SAYING, WELL, WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT SOME ESCAPE PLAN. IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S PUT MORE GUYS IN.
SO MEANWHILE, THEY SIT IN THE JUNGLE WITH THESE GUYS EATING SPAM AND CANNED BACON FOR LIKE  TWO MONTHS.
YEAH, YEAH. IT WAS ACTUALLY ALMOST LIKE R&R.
Jon: CRAZY. THEN THEY DECIDE, LET'S WALK OUT OF HERE.
RIGHT.
Jon: LET'S DPLIED OUT OF HERE.
THEY REALIZE... NEW GUINEA IS THIS INCREDIBLE TROPICAL JUNGLE. YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF IT. SO THEY JUST SAY, WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, THIS IS OUR PLAN, WE'LL  BASICALLY DROP STUFF FOR YOU TO BUILD A MAKESHIFT FOOTBALL GOALPOST, AND WE'LL STRING A  RUBBER BAND ACROSS THE TOP OF IT AND WE'LL PUT THAT TO A GLIDER. AND THEN WE'LL PUT SOME PEOPLE IN THE GLIDER AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OTHER PLANES COME, SWEEP  INTO THIS VALLEY.
Jon: AT WHAT POINT DID WILEY COYOTE FIGURE INTO THIS?
IT'S AN ACME PLAN.
Jon: AND THE NAME OF THIS GLIDER IS, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN?
THE FANLESS FAG DWOT.
SO THEY DECIDE THE CLIMB INTO THE FAGGOT.
YES.
Jon: THIS IS THE GREATEST GENERATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CONTINUE.
TRUE STORY. SO THESE PLANES WILL SWEEP INTO THE VALLEY WITH A HOOK AND GO BY THAT GOALPOST, GRAB THAT RUBBER  BAND AND PULL THAT GLIDER UP AND OUT AND OVER THE MOUNTAINS. NOW, WITH THE PEOPLE ON THE GLIDER DON'T REALIZE IS THAT THESE GLIDERS HAD A NICKNAME IN  WORLD WAR II, THE FLYING COFFIN.
Jon: YES.
SO THAT WAS THE ARMY'S RESCUE PLAN.
Jon: AND ODDLY ENOUGH, IT WORKED.
INCREDIBLY. THAT'S WHY WE CALLED IT THE MOST INCREDIBLE RESCUE MISSION OF WORLD WAR II.
Jon: THEN YOU TRACKED THESE PEOPLE. THEY ALL LED HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES AND IT'S A MAGNIFICENT STORY. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT IN A MOVIE BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE NO ONE I THINK WOULD BUY IT.
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
Jon: IT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE THEN THEY SHOT A PLANE OUT OF A GOALPOST. RIGHT. IT'S ABSOLUTELIEN CREDIBLE. LOST IN SHANGRI-LA IS ON BOOKSHELVES NOW. AN INCREDIBLE RESCUE STORY OF WORLD WAR II. MITCHELL ZUCKOFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
