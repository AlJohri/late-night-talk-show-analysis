[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME BACK. WE TURN NOW TO OUR ONGOING  COVERAGE OF THIS PENIS AND LESS  IMPORTANTLY THE NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATE WHO IS  ATTACHED TO IT. SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING FOR HIM?
THERE IS A BRAND NEW POLL  ABOUT THE NEW YORK CITY MAYOR'S  RACE. IT HAS WEINER IN FOURTH PLACE.
HE CERTAINLY IS IS SINKING IN  THE POLLS.
John: HONESTLY I THINK THE  SINKING POLL IS THE LEAST OF  THIS GUY'S PROBLEM. SO CLEARLY GROW UP. HOLD ON. I SHOULD GROW UP. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. SO CLEARLY ANTHONY WEINER'S  CAMPAIGN IS IN DANGER, NOT JUST  THAT IT'S IN CARLOS DANGER. ♪ DANGER ♪♪
John: AND TRAGICALLY THIS IS  JUST MORE BAD NEWS. FOR THE GUY WHO HAS A CAMPAIGN  THAT WON'T QUIT.
THIS MORNING WEINER'S DEALING  WITH YET ANOTHER BLOW TO HIS  STRUGGLING EFFORTS.
HIS TOP ADVISOR ANNOUNCED HE  WAS THROWING IN THE TOWEL.
John: ACTUALLY I HAPPEN TO  HAVE THAT TOWEL RIGHT HERE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER WEINER'S  BED. MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER HIS BED. YES, DO YOU LIKE THAT? IS THAT A MATURE ENOUGH JOKE FOR  YOU? ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? WHY ON EARTH WOULD WEINER'S  CAMPAIGN MANAGER RESIGN? DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH  THE FACT THAT HE SPENT THE WHOLE  LAST WEEK SUCKING ON THE EVERLASTING STOPPER OF  EMBARRASSING REVELATIONS.
THE NEW YORK DAILY NEWS IS  NOW REPORTING WHEN HE WAS A  CONGRESSMAN WEINER, HE PAID A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR $45,000 IN  CAMPAIGN CASH TO INVESTIGATE THE  HACKING OF HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT IN 2011.
John: LET'S BE VERY CLEAR  ABOUT THIS. HE SPENT $45,000 IN CAMPAIGN  DONATIONS TO INVESTIGATE WHO DID  THE THING THAT HE KNEW HE DID. WHO DID HE HIRE? THE SAME GUY THAT O.J. PAID TO  GO LOOK FOR THE REAL MURDERER? THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE EASIEST  CASE IN PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR  HISTORY. I'M GUESSING THE INVESTIGATOR  JUST CASHED THE CHECK, WALKED  BACK FROM THE BANK, UNZIPPED ANTHONY WEINER'S, POINTED TO HIS  DICK AND SAID, "I FOUND HIM. "REQUEST  THERE, JOB DONE. JOB DONE. WEINER SEEMS TO BE RUNNING OUT  OF SUPPORT. NEW YORK'S NEWSPAPERS ARE  CALLING HIM OUT. OTHERS HAVE ALSO FOLLOWED SUIT.
AT THIS POINT IT'S ABSURD. HE'S NOT QUALIFIED, NOT SCHOJ  PSYCHOLOGICALLY QUALIFIED.
SO DISRESPECTFUL OF WOMEN. IT IS IS NOT FUNNY. HE IS A NEW AGE FLASHER WHO HAS  TRADED THE TRADITIONAL RAINCOAT  THAT CAN BE OPENED TO SHOW HIS WARES FOR A DIGITAL CAMERA THAT  ENABLES HIM TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO  THE WORLD. A DUBIOUS TECHNOLOGICAL  ACHIEVEMENT.
John: YOU KNOW, WHEN AN OLD  MAN SAYS IT, IT'S HARD TO TELL  WHETHER HE'S MAD ABOUT THE SEX STUFF OR ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY. IN MY DAY YOU HAD TO EXPOSE  YOURSELF TO WOMEN ONE AT A TIME. IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE A DICK  PIC, YOU HAD TO BE ABLE TO  MAINTAIN YOUR ERECTION FOR AS LONG AS SILVER NITRATE NEEDED TO  EXPOSE THE IMAGE AND THEN HAND  IT TO THE LADY. HAND IT TO HER. AMAZINGLY IN THE FACE OF  DISAPPROVAL FROM, LET'S JUST  SAY, EVERYONE, CARLOS DANGER REFUSES TO DROP OUT. HE EVEN HAS THE BALLS NOW TO BE  ANNOYED BY ALL OF US.
WEINER ALSO INDICATED HE MAY  STOP ANSWERING QUESTIONS  ALTOGETHER ABOUT HIS ONLINE  RELATIONSHIPS.
I'VE ANSWERED THAT SIX TIMES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET MY  MESSAGE OUT. I'M GOING TO KEEP TRYING. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? WE'RE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ECHO  CHAMBER HERE WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO  OBSESSED WITH MY PENIS? WHERE COULD YOU POSSIBLY GET THE  IDEA THAT I WOULD WANT TO TALK  ABOUT SUCH A PRIVATE THING AND ABOUT HOW HARD IT GETS  SOMETIMES? WHERE IS THAT COMING INTO YOUR  BRAIN? LET ME HELP YOU OUT. IT'S NOT JUST MR. CARLOS THAT  EVERYONE SAW YOUR DICK. IT'S THAT YOU LIED ABOUT IT OVER  AND OVER AGAIN FOR YEARS IT  TURNS OUT. DON'T GET ME WRONG. YOU PROVIDED A LOT OF  ENTERTAINING MOMENTS. JUST LOOK AT THE CORNERS OF WOLF  BLITZER'S MOUTH DURING THIS  INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF WEINER'S FORMER SEXY PEN PALS.
DID YOU AT ALL FEEL YOURSELF  MANIPULATED OR SEE YOURSELF AS A  VICTIM?
I DID NOT. HE DOES KIND OF TURN THE  CONVERSATION THAT WAY. THEN YOU KIND OF GET... YOU KIND  OF GET SUCKED INTO IT. NO PUN INTENDED. I'M SORRY. YOU GET SUCKED INTO IT A LITTLE  BIT.
John: HE'S DOING THE BEST HE  CAN THERE. THE MIDDLE OF HIS LIPS SAY, "I'M  A SERIOUS NEWSMAN."  BUT THE CORNERS ARE SAYING, "I'M WOLF BLITZER, AND I GET THAT  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEX."  AT THIS POINT, NOTHING IS IS GETTING THIS GUY OUT OF THE  RACE. NOT SLIPPING POLL NUMBERS. NOT JUMPING SHIP. NOT FINANCIAL INTRO PRY TEE,  NOTHING. HE DOESN'T JUST THINK HE SHOULD  BE MAYOR DESPITE THESE THINGS. HE NOW THINKS HE SHOULD BE MAYOR  BECAUSE OF THEM.
BEING AN EFFECTIVE MAYOR  MEANS AS A RESULT OF EVERYTHING  GOING ON...
I GET TABLED. I ARGUE THIS. I ARGUE THIS. I'M GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL  MAYOR BECAUSE OF THAT. BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME A  LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE.
John: OH, IT'S GOING TO GIVE  YOU A LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE ALL  RIGHT. BECAUSE IF NEW YORKERS DO THE  RIGHT THING IT'S GOING TO MAKE  YOU INDEPENDENT FROM THE [BLEEP] OFFICE OF MAYOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
