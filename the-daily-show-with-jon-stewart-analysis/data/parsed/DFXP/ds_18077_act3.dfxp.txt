Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN AUTHOR. THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE GIRLS  OF ATOMIC PITY THE UNTOLD STORY  OF WOMEN WHO HELPED WIN WORLD WAR II. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  DENISE KIERNAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS FOR HAVING ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.
Jon: I LOVE THESE KINDS OF  BOOKS AND THIS IS A GREAT ONE. THIS IS "THE GIRLS OF ATOMIC  CITY."  IT TAKES A MOMENT IN HISTORY  THAT WE ALL THINK WE KNOW VERY WELL, SORT OF MANT MANHATTAN  PROJECT AND LOS ALAMOS AND ALL  THAT. TELL US THE STORY.
THAT'S IT EXACTLY WHEN SO  MANY OF US, MYSELF INCLUDED WHEN  I THINK ABOUT THE MANHATTAN PROJECT OR WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT  IT I THOUGHT ABOUT ROBERT  OPPENHEIMER AND WHEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT OAK RIDGE, THIS TOWN  IN TENNESSEE, BUILT FROM SCRATCH  IN 1942 FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ENRICHING FUEL FOR THE FIRST  ATOMIC BOMB. OF THE PRIMARY MANHATTAN PROJECT  SITES THIS WAS THE MOST POPULOUS  AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE WHOLE  MANHATTAN PROJECT AND THE  MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WORKING THERE WERE YOUNG WOMEN.
Jon: RIGHT AND IT WAS  75,000, 80,000 PEOPLE.
75,000 PEOPLE AND WHEN THEY  FIRST BROKE GROUND IN 1942 AND  WERE PLANNING TO BUILD THEY THOUGHT 13,000. WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE 13,000  PEOPLE LIVING HERE. BY THE MIDDLE OF 1945, 75,000  PEOPLE, PLANTS RUNNING 24-HOURS  A DAY, 24-HOUR BOWLING AND ROLLER SKATING. IT WAS A MASSIVE, MASSIVE TOWN.
Jon: THE CRAZY THING IS  THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE  DOING THERE.
YES, YES. THERE'S THAT PART, YES. SO THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO  WORKED THERE WERE TRAINED TO DO  VERY SPECIFIC TASKS. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU ARE TESTING  PIPES.
Jon: SURE.
PIPE COMES IN. HOW ARE THESE WELDS?
Jon: PIPE TESTER.
THEY LOOK PRETTY G. I  INTERVIEWED THIS ONE WOMAN THIS  IS WHAT SHE DID. I SAID WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU  WERE DOING? THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT WHERE ARE  THE PIPES COMING FROM? THAT DOOR? WHAT WHERE ARE THEY GOING? THAT DOOR. WHAT IS BEHIND THAT DOOR? PROBABLY MORE PIPES. THIS WAS HER VIEW OF MANHATTAN  PROJECT. THERE WAS ANOTHER WOMAN I  INTERVIEWED, HER FRIEND WAS  CONVINCED THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING WITH URINE. [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY? [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE THIS IS HER VIEW OF THE  PROJECT. SHE WORKED IN PROCESSING SO ALL  DAY SHE WOULD HELP -- PEOPLE  CAME IN AND DID SAMPLES, SHE COLLECTED THEM, PUT THEIR NAME  ON THEM AND SHE'S THINKING HUH,  THESE OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON BUT I KNOW  WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.
Jon: SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A  URINE AND BOWLING AND ROLLER  SKATING FACILITY. THEY HAD -- SHE HAD NO IDEA.
EVERYBODY'S DAILY EXPERIENCE  FILTERED THEIR VIEW OF WHAT WAS  GOING ON. THEY TRAINED EVERYBODY SO WELL. IF YOU WERE A CHEMIST OR  PHYSICIST YOU WERE PUTTING  THINGS TOGETHER. BUT TESTING PIPES OR A  SECRETARY, MOST PEOPLE HAD ZERO  IDEA.
Jon: THERE WERE PEOPLE  WORKING ON THE ACTUAL ENRICHMENT  OF THIS FISSILE MATERIAL.
YES.
Jon: WHERE AREN'T THEY DEAD  OF TUMORS AND SUCH? AND YOU SAID --
THAT IN MANY WAYS IS A STORY  STILL BEING WRITTEN. SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WHAT WAS GOING  ON DURING THAT TIME AND IT  DEPENDED ON WHERE YOU WORKED. SO IF YOU WERE A SECRETARY IN AN  OFFICE BUILDING, RISK OF  EXPOSURE WAS LOW. IF YOU WERE OPERATING SOME OF  THE MACHINES, THE MACHINES  ENRICHING URANIUM YOU WERE IN A SEPARATE ROOM FROM WHERE THE  URANIUM WAS BEING -- THE  ISOTOPES WERE BEING SEPARATED. IF YOU WERE WORKING IN A  FACILITY WHERE THERE WAS  PLUTONIUM, YOUR RISKS WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER. THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  BACK THEN HOW MUCH EXPOSURE IS  TOO MUCH?
Jon: THAT'S WHY THEY WERE  TAKING THEIR URINE AND THEY  WANTED TO KNOW --
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE  OUT, LEARNING AS MUCH AS THEY  COULD ABOUT THE RISKS WHILE ENRICHING THE FUELS OF BOMB.
Jon: ONE OF THE INTERESTING  THINGS I THOUGHT WAS IT WAS  PROGRESSIVE IN A SENSE OF EMPOWERING THE WOMEN WORKING  THERE.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: BUT REGRESSIVE IN  TERMS OF DEALING WITH THE RACES. IT'S A STRANGE DICHOTOMY IN THE  TOWN.
YES. IT WAS. SO IT'S WORLD WAR II. ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT'S AN  INCREDIBLE MOMENT FOR THE WOMEN. THEY ARE HAVING STUDENTS THAT  MANY OF THEM NEVER HAD BEFORE  OPERATING EQUIPMENT AND CENTRAL JOBS AND -- INDUSTRIAL JOBS AND  MAKING GOOD MONEY AND THINGS OF  THAT NATURE. THIS WAS THE SOUTH IN 1942 AND  OAK RIDGE REALLY WAS A  REFLECTION OF THE WORLD IN WHICH IT EXISTED. HOUSING WAS SEGREGATED,  CAFETERIAS WERE SEGREGATED.
Jon: EVEN IN A MANUFACTURED  TOWN WITH AN INTEGRATED ARMY?
YES. BECAUSE OF ERNEST WILL KENS  WORKING FOR THE PROJECT IN  CHICAGO. AT ONE POINT THEY HAD  DOCUMENTATION THEY WANTED HIM TO  TRANSFER DOWN TO OAK RIDGE. THEY SAID WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE  HIM TRANSFERRED BUT  UNFORTUNATELY HE WOULDN'T WANT TO GO THERE.
Jon: GREAT STORY. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: WHEN WE COME BACK  WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN THE WOMEN  FOUND OUT THEY WERE WORKING ON THE ATOMIC BOMB. PRETTY COOL. "GIRLS OF ATOMIC CITY" IT'S ON  BOOKSHELVES RIGHT NO
