OCTOBER 31, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: GOOD EVENING! GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW'S" HALLOWEEN SPEAK TACK ALREADY A! (LAUGHTER) SPOOK-TACULAR! (LAUGHTER) THAT'S ACTUALLY ALL WE HAD PLANNED FOR THE SPOOK-TACULAR. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A LOT MORE THAN WE'D EVER DONE BEFORE BUT... ANYWAY. WE GOT A GOOD SHOW FROM THE OFFICE. MINDY KALING IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SPOOK-TACULAR! SEE? (LAUGHTER) WE ONLY PLANNED THE LIGHTING QUEUE ONCE. BIG NEWS TODAY FOR PLANET EARTH.
A BABY GIRL BORN THIS MORNING IN THE PHILIPPINES IS BEING CALLED THE SEVEN BILLIONTH  PERSON IN THE WORLD.
Jon: WOW. THAT IS EXCITING. (LAUGHTER) LET ME, IF I MAY, ADDRESS OUR SEVEN BILLIONTH PERSON. SAVE US! WE'RE VERY SCARED! PLEASE GROW UP TO BE OUR MESSIAH. (LAUGHTER) PLEASE BE OUR NEO. I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET THAT REFERENCE, IT'S FROM  "THE MATRIX" WHICH IS A TOTALLY KICK-ASS MOVIE-- THE FIRST ONE--  THEY GET LESS COOL... IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE OUR ON HOPE, WHICH IS ALSO FROM A MOVIE. (LAUGHTER) BUT MY POINT IS, PLEASE BE OUR MESSIAH. PLEASE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE (BLEEP). THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HERING A LOT FROM NOW ON. WE'RE OUT OF RAISIN BRAN." OUR TOP STORY COMES ONCE AGAIN  FROM THE REPUBLICAN'S DESPERATE RACE TO FIND A NOMINEE WHOSE  NAME DOESN'T RHINE WITH SCHMIDT SCHMNOMNEY. HERMAN CAIN IS THE LATEST. HOW DOES IT LOOK FOR HIM.
DURING CAIN'S TIME AS A LOBBYIST, AT LEAST TWO WOMEN COMPLAINED OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR. SPECIFICALLY SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE DEHEAT WAVE YOUR. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: IN HER MAIN CANE'S DEFENSE, THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN  THE PIZZA WORLD THAT'S NOT SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE. "HEY, YOU WANT SAUSAGE ON YOUR PIE?" (LAUGHTER) "HEY, YOU WANT KNOW STUFF YOUR  CRUST?" (LAUGHTER) "NO, NO, I TOLD YOU, I GUARANTEE, I WILL COME IN 30  MINUTES OR LESS." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TOLD YOU. BY THE WAY, THAT'S A VERY OPTIMISTIC... (LAUGHTER) I THINK THE KEY PHRASE IS THERE "OR LESS." ALL RIGHT. THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS CHARGES ON HERMAN CAIN. I HOPE THAT THE REPORTING ON THIS ISSUE... I KNOW. I HOPE THE REPORTING ON THIS MUST BE HANDLED RESPONSIVELY.
THERE WERE GESTURES, THERE WERE COMMENTS, CERTAIN SUGGESTIVE OVERTURES, FOR  INSTANCE, THINGS THAT MADE THESE WOMEN UNCOMFORTABLE, MADE THEM ANGRY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU HAD TO END THE SEGMENT ON CAIN AND TWO NUNS, NEW THAT'S THE FOOTAGE YOU HAD TO USE. ARE THESE THE TWO WOMEN WHO WERE ACCUSING CAIN? IF NOT, SOMEWHAT PREJUDICIAL IMAGE FOR A SEXUAL HARASSMENT STORY. THE GUY'S OUT OF CONTROL, HE'S TRYING TO BANG NUNS ON A PARTY BUS! (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE! THIS IS A VERY BIG CHALLENGE FOR HERMAN CAIN. IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE TO RECONCILE A NONSENSICAL 999 TAX PLAN WITH EXISTING STATE TAXES.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF MIXING APPLES AND ORANGES.
Jon: NO, THEY'RE BOTH (BLEEP)ING APPLES. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHY YOU WANT TO DEFEND OUR SOUTHERN BORDER WITH A GIANT MEXICAN ZAPPER.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT WAS A GOOD JOKE AND IT'S  PROBABLY NOT A JOKE THAT FOLKS MAKE IF YOU'RE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. I DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR USING A COMBINATION OF A FENCE. AND IT MIGHT BE ELECTRIFIED. I'M NOT WALKING AWAY FROM THAT. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: IT WAS A JOKE! LET'S DO IT. (LAUGHTER) SO FORGET ABOUT THE NEWS MEDIA. I YIELD MY REMAINING TIME TO DEFENSE-TO-A DEFENSE FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA.
I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY HARASSED ANYONE. LET'S SAY THAT. SECONDLY, I'VE NEVER SEXUALLY HARASSED ANYONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND THIRDLY I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY HARASSED ANYONE. AND FOR MY FOURTH POINT I REFER YOU TO POINTS ONE THROUGH THREE. (LAUGHTER) NAILED IT! ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE IT TO FOX NEWS. THEY DIDN'T LET CAIN OFF THAT EASY.
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO SETTLE A CLAIM... GIVEN MONEY OR PAID SOMEONE BECAUSE OF A CLAIM OF  SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT?
AT THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. NOW, OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION, ABSOLUTELY NOT. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IS THE ONE THAT YOU'RE...
YOU CAN'T JUST GO WELL, OTHER THAN THAT, NO. "HAVE YOU EVER KIDNAP A BABY?" "WELL, OTHER THAN THE LINDBERGH BOY. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'VE JUST DONE THE ONE. BUT IT'S THE ONLY ONE I COULD THINK OF." YOU KNOW WHAT'S SAD? FORGET ABOUT THE INCOHERENCE OF MOST OF HERMAN CAIN'S POLICY PLANS. IF HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH, HE'S JUST A NICE CHURCH-GOING GUY AND  EVERYTHING HE DOES NOW IS TAINTED BY THESE ALLEGATIONS. EVEN HIS SIMPLE LOVE OF ICE CREAM.
BLACK WALNUT. BECAUSE IT TASTES GOOD ALL THE TIME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT JUST SOUNDS REALLY DIRTY NOW. AND THAT CLIP OF HERMAN CAIN SPILING AT THE END OF HIS POLITICAL ADS. (LAUGHTER) THAT COMMERCIAL IS ALWAYS GOING TO PLAY WITH DIFFERENT MUSIC IN PEOPLE'S HEADS NOW. (SEX SEXY MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHTER) STOP LOOKING AT MY BLACK WALNUT. SO IS POSSIBLY HOBBLED. COULD RICK PERRY HURT BY STIFFNESS IN HIS DEBIT PERFORMANCES SEIZE THE MOMENT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE?
THIS IS SUCH A COOL STATE. I MEAN, COME ON: LIVE FREE OR DIE? IT'S LIKE LIVE FREE OR DIE, VICTORY OR DEATH, BRING IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU'RE OVERCORRECTING. "I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, THE GRANITE STATE? I MEAN... IT'S LIKE A BLACK ROCK YOU KNOW? I JUST WANT TO GET IN THERE AND JUST (BLEEP) THAT GRANITE! COME ON! THERE'S GOT TO BE OIL IN HERE SOMEWHERE!" (LAUGHTER) ERR! "NEW HAMPSHIRE! I JUST WANT TO GRAB YOUR BALLS! " DON'T WORRY, IT GETS WORSE.
TEXAS RANGERS AFTER 50 YEARS ARE GOING TO WIN A WORLD SERIES! (BOOS) OOPS. TODAY HAS BEEN AWESOME, GIRL! 20% FLAT TAX, PUT IT ON THERE, TAKE YOUR DEDUCTIONS OFF, SEND IT IN. I GREW UP ON A FARM. I GREW UP... (LAUGHS) I GREW UP ON A FARM. THAT LITTLE PLAN THAT I JUST SHARED WITH YOU DOESN'T FORCE THE GRANITE STATE TO EXPAND YOUR  TAX FOOTPRINT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. LIKE THE 9% EXPANSION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BEST-CASE SCENARIO: THAT DUDE'S HAMMERED. WORST-CASE SCENARIO THAT IS PERRY SOBER AND EVERY TIME WE'VE  SEEN HIM PREVIOUSLY HE'S BEEN HAMMERED. (LAUGHTER) OR THERE IS ONE OTHER EXPLANATION: RICK PERRY JUST GOT BACK FROM THE DENTIST.
IS THIS REAL LIFE?
UH-UH...
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. (SCREAMING)
Jon: THAT TAX BASE EXPANSION. (SCREAMING) AFTER THE EVENTS OF THIS WEEKEND BETWEEN HERMAN CAIN AND RICK  PERRY I'M READY FOR "THE DAILY SHOW" TO UNVEIL A BRAND NEW  SEGMENT, "MITT ROMNEY, THE LUCKIEST MOTHER FUDGER ON
