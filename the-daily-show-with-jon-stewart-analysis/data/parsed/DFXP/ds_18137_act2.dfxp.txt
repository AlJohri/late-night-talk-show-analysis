WELCOME BACK IT WAS A  GORGEOUS WEEKEND HERE IN THE  NORTHEAST, SUNNY, NOT TOO  HUMID. IF ARE YOU ANYTHING LIKE ME  IT WAS A PERFECT TIME TO GET  OUTSIDE, BUY A BAGEL AND HEAD IMMEDIATELY BACK  INDOORS TO WATCH INTERNET  VIDEOS FOR A SOLID HOUR. SPECIFICALLY YOU CHOOSE CAT  VIDEOS, LOOK, IT'S A CAT  PLAYING WHAT WATER. CATS USUALLY DON'T LIKE  WATER. BUT THIS PARTICULAR CAT  LOVES IT. YOU SILLY SOGGY CAT! YOU SILLY CAT. JUST HARMLESS FUN THAT  EVERYONE CAN ENJOY. AND THEN I MADE ONE CRUCIAL  MISTAKE. I SCROLLED DOWN THROUGH THE  COMMENTS AND I SWEAR THIS IS  TRUE, BANG, OBAMA IS A [BLEEP] IDIOT. FOR NO REASON. NOW LOOK, I COUNT STAND NJH  84'S POINT IF THIS CAT WAS  SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN A  BENGHAZI COVER-UP. BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT  WASN'T. WE DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE  THAT SUGGESTS THAT. ALSO, IF THE CAT'S NAME WAS  OBAMA IT MIGHT MAKE SOME  SENSE. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD STILL BE A  LITTLE HARSH, IT'S JUST  PLAYING WITH SOME WATER. PUT TRUTH IS, PEOPLE NOW TRY  TO CRAM THEIR POLITICS INTO  EVERYTHING. WE SAW IT JUST RECENTLY.
WITH ALL THE ATTENTION  THAT HAS BEEN LAVISHED THIS  WEEK ON THE ROYAL BABY THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD MOMENT TO  TAKE A LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF  INFANT MORTALITY HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
DOES IT? DOES IT SEEM LIKE A GOOD  OPPORTUNITY? (LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW T  ACTUALLY SEEMS LIKE AN EVEN  BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO NOT BRING THAT UP. BUT LOOK, THAT IS JUST ONE  GUY. I'M SURE EVERYONE ELSE WAS  RESPECTFUL ON A UNIVERSALLY  HAPPY OCCASION.
EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT  CAST BABIES AS FUTURE FIGURE  HEADS IN THIS COUNTRY, THE FACT IS THAT THE ACCIDENT OF  WHERE AND TO WHOM WE ARE  BORN DETERMINES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT OUR LIFE'S  OUTCOMES.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS  GOING TO BREAK THE BABY THE  NEWS IF HE BECOMES AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, WHICH  COULD HAPPEN, WHEN OBAMACARE  IS GOING TO MEAN TO HIM.
IT'S A BABY! IT'S A BABY! YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TALKING  POINTS ABOUT A PERSON BEFORE  THAT PERSON CAN TALK. PLEASE, PLEASE UNDERSTAND,  THE ROYAL BIRTH WAS LIKE  BRITAIN'S SUPER BOWL. TOTALLY OVERHYPED BUT FOR A  BRIEF MOMENT IT BROUGHT US  TOGETHER. THINK ABOUT IT, EVERYONE  LOVES THE SUPER BOWL. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE GAME  THERE IS THE HALFTIME SHOW. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT THERE  IS THE COMMERCIALS. IT TRANSCENDS POLITICS AND  BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.
THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S  SECOND SUPER BOWL THERE  OFFICE SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD LOOK AT WHAT HIS  CHANGED OVER THE LAST FOUR  YEARS. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO  THE MONEY YOU'RE SPENDING.
GOING HAVE A COLD ONE AT  THE SUPER BOWL PAEFERMENT  THE PRICE PER BEER UP 6.5% FROM FOUR YEARS AGO.
CHICKEN LEGS FROM 51  CENTS PER POUND, GAS MORE  THAN 56%. SINCE SUPER BOWL 43.
PLEASE DON'T RUIN SPORTS. THE WHOLE JOY OF SPORTS IS  THAT IT'S AN ANESTHETIC, AN  ESCAPE FROM CURRENT AFFAIRS.
MOVING ON TO DWIGHT  HOWARD, HE'S LEAVING L.A. HEADING TO HOUSTON.
TO PLAY FOR THE HOUSTON  LOCATES IN THE NBA.
THERE, THAT'S WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT, A SPORT STORY,  A PLAY, MOVING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER, MILDLY  INTERESTING AND IT HAS NO  WIDER IMPLICATIONS  WHATSOEVER.
AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM  DID THE MATH BEHIND HOWARD'S  DECISION. THE HIGHER TAX LIABILITY IN  L.A. THAT INCLUDES STATE AND  FEDERAL TAX WAS LEAVE HIM WITH AN ANNUAL SALARY OF  JUST OVER $10.3 MILLION. IN TEXAS WHERE THERE IS NO  STATE INCOME TAX HORX WARD  WILL BE RECEIVING $12.4  MILLION EACH YEAR. AND THAT IS YOUR DIFFERENCE.
LOOK, THAT'S NOT HOW FREE  AGENCY WORKS. PLAYERS NATURALLY  GRAVITATING TOO WHERE TAXES  WERE THE LOWEST EVERY NBA  PLAYER WOULD BE PLAYING FOR THE CAYMAN ISLAND CONCHES. SO LOOK, FINE, FINE, IF THE  MEDIA IS GOING TO TAKE ALL  OF OUR INNOCENT PLEASURES FROM SPORTS TO BABIES TO  KINTS AND SHOVE THEM THROUGH  SOME PARTISAN PRISM, I GUESS THERE IS NO REFUGE LEFT  EXCEPT NATURE HERSELF, THE  GREAT OUTDOORS, FAR FROM THE POLITICAL BABBLE.
AFTER MONTHS, YEARS  REALLY, OF ANTICIPATION, IT  IS HAPPENED. WASHINGTON'S CORPS FLOWER  HAS BLOOMED. A GIANT RAINFOREST PLANT  LIVING IN THE U.S. BOT ANIC  GAERNDS IS A GIANT FLOWER  THAT SMELLS ODDLY LIKE ROTTING FLESH.
LOVELY. A FLOWER, A LOVELY BLOOMING  MIRACLE OF NATURE. SURE IT STINKS OF DEATH,  PEOPLE, BUT AT LEAST IT  DOESN'T STINK OF POLITICS.
THE CORPS FLOWER IS NOW  AT ITS PEAK SMELL THAT IS A  REAL THING, AN WILL REMAIN OPEN FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. AFTER THAT THE FLOWER WILL  BEGIN TO COLLAPSE IN ON  ITSELF EMBARKING ON A TRA  JECK OTHER VERY SIMILAR TO MICHELE BACHMANN'S  CONGRESSIONAL CAREER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND THERE YOU GO. LEAVE IT TO CABLE NEWS TO  TAKE THE SMELL OF ROTTING  FLESH AND SOMEHOW RUIN
