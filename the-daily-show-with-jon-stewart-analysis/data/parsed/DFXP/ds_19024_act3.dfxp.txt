(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST ACADEMY AWARD WINNER, HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED THE BOOK THIEF.
ARE YOU SICK.
I'M FINE.
WHAT IS THE MATTER.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
SORRY, PAPA. ARE YOU GOING TO TELL MAMMA? PAPA?
DID ANYONE SEE YOU? LET'S MAKE THIS OUR SECRET.
Jon: A SPOILER ALERT, HITLER DIES IN THE END. PLEASE WELCOME GEOFFREY RUSH. SIR! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW ARE YOU. SIT. IN OUR COUNTRY THE NORMAL PROTOCOL WOULD BE THAT THE GUEST WOULD SIT AND THEN I WOULD SIT, DOES IT WORK SIMILARLY IN YOUR LAND.
IT'S THE SAME.
Jon: THE SAME.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON. HOW ARE YOU DOING? THIS IS A PHENOMENAL MOVIE. WONDERFUL MOVIE. AND YOUR PERFORMANCE IN IT AS ALWAYS, I DON'T-- IT'S HARD TO ADD MORE SUPERLATIVES WONDERFUL.
I'M DOING GOOD. WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING WITH THE FILM THROUGH SOME FESTIVALS AND GUILD SCREENINGS. AND WE WENT TO THE MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE IN L.A. AND HAD A NICE SCREENING THERE.
Jon: I IMAGINE THEY DON'T CRITICIZE YOU AFTER A MOVIE THERE AT THE MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE.
THEY WERE BEYOND TOLERANT. IT WAS GREAT AT THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON IT WAS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL NIGHT BECAUSE THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SURVIVORS IN THE AUDIENCE. AND I MET A GUY, COME UP TO ME AND SAID I WAS 14 DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND I WAS HIDDEN BY A VERY KINDLY AVERAGE FARMER JUST ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS. AND HE REMINDED ME, YOUR CHARACTER IN THE FILM REMINDED ME SO MUCH OF HIM. AND THIS GUY IS NOW IN HIS LATE 80s I WOULD IMAGINE. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH.
Jon: THAT'S AMAZING. THAT'S GOT TO MAKE YOU FEEL IN SOME WAY LIKE JUST INCREDIBLY MOVED TO EVEN HAVE DONE IT, TO EVEN HAVE PUT THE FILM OUT. BECAUSE I IMAGINE THEIR RESPONSE TO IT IS ALMOST MORE MEANINGFUL THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
YEAH, WELL, AT THAT MUSEUM, I HAD A BIG EXHIBITION ON AT THE TIME ABOUT COMPLICITY AND THE KIND OF PRESSURES THAT PEOPLE WERE UNDER, IN VERY REMOTE GERMAN TOWNS AS THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS WERE, YOU KNOW, REALLY PUTTING, REALLY EATING INTO THE PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND YOU KNOW, NEIGHBORS, SOMETIMES GOT TERRORIZED, WERE FEARFUL, WENT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION RATHER THAN A MORE HUMANE ETHICAL KIND OF RESPONSE.
Jon: THE MORAL RESPONSE YOU WOULD THINK, WHERE DID YOU FILL TESTIMONY, DID YOU FILM IT HERE?
WE WERE, IT WAS GREAT FOR ME AS AN ACTOR. WE WERE AT THE HISTORIC STUDIOS IN BERLIN WHICH IS WHERE.
Jon: WOW.
IN THE OLD DAYS THE YOUNG BILLY WILDER, LUBICH.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
ALL THOSE LONG FORGOTTEN GERMAN FILMMAKERS, TARANTINO WORKED THERE WITH INGLORIOUS BASTARDS.
Jon: HOW DID THEY RESPOND. WAS THAT ON A SOUNDSTAGE OR ARE YOU ON A STREET AND THEY DRESSED THE STREET AND DO LOCAL PEOPLE GO WHAT ARE YOU UP TO.
KIND OF BECAUSE ALL THE NAZI STUFF IS NOW BANNED, SO IT'S PRETTY HARD TO GET SWASTIKAS OUT AND BE SINGING THE ORIGINAL LYRICS TO UBERALIS. AND.
Jon: I IMAGINE TOO THAT THEY MIGHT THINK THAT A MOVIE IS NOT THE THING THAT THEY WANT TO BE-- TO BE REMINDED.
BERLIN IS, I HAD A FANTASTIC TIME THERE BECAUSE WE HAD A PREDOMINANTLY GERMAN CREW AND FANTASTIC GERMAN ACTOR, SO IT WAS LIKE A REALLY SERIOUS IMMERSION INTO HOW THEY'VE COME OUT OF AND ARE WRESTLING WITH PROBABLY THE WORST CENTURY THAT A COUNTRY COULD GO THROUGH.
Jon: RIGHT. I ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT THAT. HOW A COUNTRY, WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS, THAT YOUR COUNTRY HAS DONE THAT IS WITHOUT QUESTION EVIL, COUNTRYMEN THAT WERE COMPLICIT IN IT BUT MAYBE YOU WERE NOT DIRECTLY OR YOUR FAMILY WASN'T, DO YOU BEGIN TO GET RESENTFUL, I ALWAYS WONDER THAT WITH THE BACKLASH AGAINST, IN THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT LIKE SLAVERY OR NATIVE AMERICAN, WHAT WE'VE DONE, PEOPLE SAYING WELL THAT WASN'T ME, I WASN'T THERE. IS THERE BACKLASH?
WE'RE PROBABLY GETTING FROM ALL ANGLES IN THE RESPONSE TO THE FILM WHICH IS, IT SEEMED, I MEAN AS AN ACTOR I USED TO BE A STAGE ACTOR I LIKED GOING AND SITTING IN WITH SOME AUDIENCES, I'VE SAT IN WITH SOME PUBLIC PERFORMANCES, I'VE SAT IN WITH FESTIVALS. AND YOU CAN READ THE HOUSE. IT IS A DEEPLY EMOTIONAL, IT'S A SLOW BUILD OF AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO A VERY DARK CHAPTER BUT THE GREAT THING SEEMS TO BE THAT IT HAPPENS AT DIFFERENT POINTS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE. WE'VE TRIED NOT TO BE SENTIMENTAL OR MELODRAMATIC ABOUT IT. MY AGENT DESCRIBED IT AS A FIVE HANKER CHIEF MOVIE AND THAT WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD FOR THE POSTER. BECAUSE IT IS NOT PRESCRIBING HOW YOU SHOULD HAVE A RESPONSE. IT'S REALIZING, FROM THE ORIGINAL BOOK, WHAT, THE WHAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK HAS GIVEN US IS A GREAT GIFT TO HAVE EMPATHY FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE IN GERMANY WHO WERE SWEPT UP IN THIS TERRIBLE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, INSIDIOUS POLITICAL MAELSTROM.
AND HUMANIZING THEIR PLIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DO AS WELL. WHAT A THOUGHTFUL MAN YOU ARE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON HERE. I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU'RE NOT LIKE THIS NORMALLY. THAT NORMALLY YOU LIKE TO GET DRUNK ON A BEER KEG STAND AND --
I DO.
Jon: AN GET IN FISTFIGHTS IN THE STREET. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY AND TALKING ABOUT IT. GEOFFREY RUSH
