(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO A COUPLE WEEKS AGO... I THINK IT WAS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO STEVE COHEN-- NOT THE CHIROPRACTOR-- (LAUGHTER)  OR THE OTHER CHIROPRACTOR. THE CONGRESSMAN FROM TENNESSEE, HE WENT ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE AND COMPARED WITH WHAT HE CALLED REPUBLICAN LIES ABOUT  HEALTH CARE TO THE BIG LIE, JOSEPH GOEBBEL POPULARIZED IN PERPETRATING NAZI ATROCITIES. WE ALONG WITH OTHERS IN THE MEDIA AND GOVERNMENT HIT HIM PRETTY HARD. DONE. NEXT. UNTIL...
THE LEADING COMMENTATORS ON THIS NETWORK USE THIS KIND OF LANGUAGE. SO LET'S YOU AND I GET TOGETHER RIGHT NOW AND SAY THAT THERE'S...
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WELL THAT IS... I MEAN, LISTEN, PEOPLE CAN BE THE JUDGE OF IT.
THEY CAN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SIT AND WATCH OUR PROGRAMMING EVERY NIGHT BUT I WATCH IT EVERYDAY  AND YOU'RE WRONG. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO LET THAT GO? (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, YOU KNOW... THEY USE NAZI LIKE 16 YEAR USE "LIKE."  IT'S A STUTTER. "D'UH, THERE'S NOTHING ON T.V., NAZI." (LAUGHTER) SO WE DID THE USUAL CRAP, A BUNCH OF CLIPS, FOX HOSTS USING  THE WORD NAZI, SOMEONE DOING IT ON MEGYN KELLY'S PROGRAM TO MEGYN KELLY. POINT TAKEN. GOOD TIME HAD BY ALL. (LAUGHTER) AND THE SYMBIOTIC CYCLE OF CABLE LIFE CONTINUES. UNTIL I REALIZED I HAD HURT SOMEONE. (LAUGHTER) (AUDIENCE REACTS) SOMEONE THAT I CARE ABOUT.
JON STEWART SEES IT A BIT DIFFERENTLY. HE DID NOT DEFEND COHEN. HE DIDN'T DEFEND THE MAN. BUT HE BELIEVE THERE IS'S HYPOCRISY IN PLAY IN THAT I, YOUR HUMBLE CORRESPONDENT, AM A PART OF IT. IF YOU LOOK BACK IN WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY YOU CANNOT ESCAPE THE SIMILARITIES WHAT  HITLER AND HIS CUTTHROATS DID BACK THEN AND THE HATE-FILLED BLOCKS, WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW.
Jon: THAT CLIP WAS FROM FEBRUARY 28, 2008, AND IT WAS ED TED BY THE STEWART FOLKS. HERE'S THE CONTENT IN THAT STATEMENT. HEY.
Jon: WHY YOU USED THE NAZI REFERENCE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IN THIS. (LAUGHTER) THE SEGMENT IS FOR MEGYN KELLY TO TAKE OFFENSE TO, NOT YOU. (LAUGHTER) IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU, BILL. THE SEGMENT WAS TO SHOW, CONTRARY TO MS. KELLY'S STATEMENT THAT IT'S NOT THE TYPE OF RHETORIC USED ON FOX NEWS, THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES APPEAR-- QUITE FREQUENTLY. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S ALL IT WAS. WHY YOU COMPARED ARIANNA HUFFINGTONTOR HUFFINGTON POST TO NAZI PROPAGANDA IS IMMATERIAL IN  THIS CASE. ALTHOUGH SINCE YOU SEEM INTERESTED IN GETTING INTO IT... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE COURT WILL ALLOW YOUR WITNESS.
NANCY REAGAN FELL, FELL DOWN AND HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THIS APPEARED ON THE HUFFINGTON POST. "LIKE HER EVIL HUSBAND, SHE HAS LIVED FAR TOO LONG. HERE'S HOPING THE HAG SUFFERS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THEN CROAKS IN THE TUB."  NOW, I SUBMIT TO YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT MY COMPARESTON THE VILE NAZI PROPAGANDA MACHINE  IS DEAD ON. YOU CAN MAKE THE CALL ON THAT.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, LET ME THEY. TWO THINGS. ONE, THAT WAS A HORRIBLE THING FOR SOMEONE TO WRITE. AND WHATEVER VICIOUS LOSER OR, IF I MAY PUT IT IN YOUR PARLANCE PINHEAD, WHOEVER WROTE THAT DESERVES CONDEMNATION. IN FACT, TELEVISION CONDEMNATION. BUT BEING A HEARTLESS DOUCHE ISN'T EXACTLY SAME AS BEING A NAZI PROPAGANDIST. (LAUGHTER) AND NUMBER TWO, THE QUOTE THAT YOU'RE USING WAS FROM A COMMENTER ON A BLOG POST. I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THE NAZI ROAD WHEN YOU'RE  JUDGING AN ORGANIZATION BY THE WORST THINGS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN POSTED ON THAT ORGANIZATION'S  WEB SITE. WILL THE COURT ALLOW EXHIBIT "B"? (APPLAUSE) THIS IS FROM FOXNATION.COM TODAY FROM "OBAMA BLOWS."  "HEY, MICHELLE, SAW YOUR FAT ASS AT YOUR HUBBY'S SPEECH. APPEARS YOU'RE HAULING ABOUT 100 EXCESS POUNDS. TRY EXERCISE, YOU DISGUSTING PIG." 23 PEOPLE LIKED THIS. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AS TRULY HORRIBLE AS THESE BLOG POSTS ARE, THAT DOESN'T MAKE  EVEN THE PEOPLE MAKING THESE COMMENTS NAZIS OR AKIN TO NAZI PROPAGANDISTS AND IT CERTAINLY  DOESN'T MAKE YOU OR THE MODERATORS AT FOXNATION.COM NAZI SYMPATHIZERS, GESTAPO, BROWN  SHIRTS OR PEOPLE WHO PLAY CASTLE WOLFEN STEIN AND WORK FOR THE WRONG TEAM. (LAUGHTER) SO MY POINT WAS, CONTRARY TO WHAT YOUR COLLEAGUE MS. KELLY WAS SUGGESTING-- THAT FOX  COMMENTATORS DO USE NAZI ANALOGIES-- AND YOUR POINT SEEMED TO BE YEAH, BUT I HAD A GOOD REASON. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS EVERYBODY THINKS THEY HAVE A GOOD REASON. STEVE COHEN THOUGHT HE HAD A GOOD REASON. IT'S LIKE SPEEDING. I YELLED AT STEVE COHEN FOR SPEEDING. MEGYN KELLY YELLED AT STEVE COHEN FOR SPEEDING AND THEN SHE SAID "GOOD THING WE DON'T  SPEED." AND I SAID "LOOK AT ALL THOSE (BEEP) PEOPLE SPEEDING RIGHT THERE."  AND THEN YOU SAID "YOU TOOK THAT OUT OF CONTEXT, I WAS LATE." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, BILL... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU... I'VE GOT  TO TELL YOU, YOU'RE LATE A LOT.
IT'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KKK AND THE NAZIS WHO HAVE  WEB SITES THAN THE DAILY KOS. THESE FAR-LEFT NAZIS-- AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE-- (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: BILL, I ACTUALLY RESPECT YOU. I EVEN LUH... I EVEN LUH... (LAUGHTER) I EVEN LIKE... I LIKE YOU. AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU WILL COME ON OTHER SHOWS AND BE CHALLENGED AND HAVE OTHERS ON  YOUR SHOW CHALLENGE YOU, UNLIKE SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. GLENN BECK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT HONESTLY, I STAND BY THE BIT. TRUTH IS, ALL I WANTED WAS FOR MEGYN KELLY TO (BEEP). THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY AND GET A PRETTY GIRL TO CALL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
