Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HE WAS THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF TREASURY FROM 2009 TO 2013, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "STRESS TEST," REFLECTIONS ON FINANCIAL CRISES. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM TIM GEITHNER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YA? LOOK AT THIS THING. LOOK AT THIS THING. LOOK WHAT I HAD TO CHOKE THROUGH OVER THIS PAST WEEK!
IT'S EXCELLENT. IT'S EXCELLENT.
Jon: IT IS EXCELLENT. "STRESS TEST." HERE'S WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD BEGIN. IT SEEMS WHAT THIS BOOK SEEKS TO DO IS CLARIFY A PERCEPTION DIFFERENCE. THE PERCEPTION ON YOUR END AND MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT'S END THAT THE BAILOUTS WORKED AND WERE THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THE PERCEPTION ON, LET'S SAY, THE OTHER END OF PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO AND DIDN'T WORK. SO LET'S TAKE THAT. LET'S START WITH YOUR PERCEPTION. IT'S LIKE AN OPTICAL ILLUSION. YOU SEE THE THING WHERE ONE PERSON LOOKS AT IT AND THEY SEE A PRETTY GIRL AND YOU FLIP IT AND THE OTHER PERSON LOOKS AT IT AND SEES AMERICA GETTING (BLEEP). SO LET'S FIGURE THAT OUT. (LAUGHTER) WHAT IS YOUR PERCEPTION OF THIS CRISIS AND WHY WE BAILED OUT THE BANKS THE WAY WE DID?
THERE'S ONLY ONE REALITY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. IT WAS A TERRIBLE FINANCIAL PANIC, AND THE ONLY OPTION, THE ONLY RESPONSIBLE, JUST, MORAL THING TO DO IN THAT CONTEXT IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE RISK OF MASS UNEMPLOYMENT, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS IN FINANCIAL PANICS, UNLESS GOVERNMENTS STEP IN AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP THE LIGHTS ON.
Jon: SO THIS WAS A BULWARK -- YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS THERE WAS A PLANE GOING DOWN, THE ARSONISTS WERE ON THE PLANE, IT WAS ON FIRE --
IF IT WAS JUST THE ARSONISTS, YOU COULD LET THE PLANE CRASH, IT DIDN'T MATTER.
Jon: I SEE.
THE PROBLEM WAS, THERE WERE A BUNCH OF INNOCENT VICTIMS ON THE PLANE WITH THEM --
ON THE PLANE WITH THEM, THAT'S THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE'RE ON THE PLANE WITH THEM.
AND YOUR FIRST OBLIGATION IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LAND THAT PLANE SAFELY.
Jon: I SEE.
THAT'S NOT YOUR ONLY OBLIGATION BECAUSE, ONCE YOU DO THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN, YOU WANT TO TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MISTAKES THEY MADE, FIX THE SYSTEM SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, BUT THE FIRST OBLIGATION IN THE PANIC IS TO MAKE SURE YOU DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PROTECT THEM FROM WHAT WE SAW IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION WHICH WAS 25% UNEMPLOYMENT AND BREAD LINES FOR A DECADE. AND IF YOU, IN THAT CONTEXT, YOU HAVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT SEEMS INTUITIVE AND FAIR. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM RUNNING FROM THE SYSTEM, THE SYSTEM FROM COLLAPSING.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT THE SYSTEM TO COLLAPSE.
WE DON'T DO IT FOR THE BANKS OR THE BANKERS.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU DO IT TO PROTECT THEM FROM THEIR MISTAKES.
Jon: HERE'S WHERE I GUESS THE PERCEPTIONS BEGIN TO SHIFT, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A COMPELLING CASE, THAT YOU'RE BEING TOLD THIS ECONOMY IS GOING TO CRATER AND THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ARSONISTS ARE ON THE PLANE WITH US, WE HAVE TO LAND THE PLANE. THEN IT FELT LIKE YOU TOOK THE ARSONISTS OFF THE PLANE AND GOT THEM A MASSAGE AND A STEAK DINNER. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) SO THE PLANE HAS NOW LANDED AND OUR CLOTHES STILL SMELL LIKE SMOKE.
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. THEY WENT AND BOUGHT THEMSELVES A MASSAGE AND A NICE DINNER
Jon: ON US.
ON US, ON US.
Jon: BUT WE CONTINUED TO --
AND THE COUNTRY WAS STILL BURNING.
Jon: THAT IS CORRECT. AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY TO LAG BEHIND IN RECOVERY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THE HOUSING MARKET HASN'T REALLY COME BACK. WE HAVE THESE 8 TO 10 MILLION HOMES STILL UNDERWATER AS THEY CALL IT.
ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY JUST ON COMPARISON, THE WORLD'S HAD LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH FINANCIAL CRISES, THIS IS NOT LIKE A HYPOTHETICAL THING, IT'S TRAGIC.
Jon: NO, IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER.
IT'S DEVASTATING.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD OF THIS ECONOMY, AND IT'S STILL VERY HARD AND THERE IS STILL A LOT OF TRAGIC PAIN LEFT OVER FROM THIS STUFF, BUT THE RECORD OF THIS RECOVERY IS VERY GOOD AGAINST THE LAST CENTURY OF COUNTRIES COMING OUT OF THESE CRISES.
Jon: NOT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT NECESSARILY. IT SEEMS VERY GOOD FOR THE BANKING SYSTEM AND THE DOW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE BANKING SYSTEM. WHAT MATTERS IS DID THE ECONOMY GET GROWING AGAIN AND DID YOU GET PEOPLE START TO COME BACK TO WORK.  HOW QUICKLY DID THAT HAPPEN?
Jon: DIDN'T THAT LAG BEHIND OTHER RECOVERIES?
NOT AGAINST RECOVERIES FOLLOWING FINANCIAL PANICS LIKE THIS.
Jon: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 1929.
NO, NOT JUST 1929, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD OF -- WE HAD A BUNCH-EMERGING MARKETS FALL OFF THE CLIFF IN THE '90s. ALMOST GREAT DEPRESSION-LIKE OUTCOMES. SO, IF YOU LOOK AT A BROAD MEASURE OF THOSE THINGS. NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S GOOD ENOUGH. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY STRONGER AND IT WASN'T STRONGER MOSTLY BECAUSE WE HAD A LITTLE PREMATURE FEVER OF AUSTERITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND FISCAL POLICY TURNED TOO TIGHT TOO SOON, CUT SPENDING PRETTY SAVAGELY WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS STILL PRETTY WEAK.
Jon: WITHIN IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT SUCKED A LOT OF GROWTH OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN WHAT WE NEEDED WAS MORE ACCELERATED LONGER.
Jon: I WANT TO TALK TO YOU NEXT ABOUT THE PERCEPTION THAT THOSE WHO FEEL THE BAILOUT WAS UNFAIR AS BEING POPULOUS RAMPAGERS VERSUS THE REALITY OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF IT. WE'LL BE BACK WITH SECRETARY GEITHNER AFTER THE BREAK RIGHT AFTER THIS.
