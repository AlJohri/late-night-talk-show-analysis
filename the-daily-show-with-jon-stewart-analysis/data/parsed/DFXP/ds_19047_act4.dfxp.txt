Jon: HEY WE'RE BACK. ARE WE BACK? YEAH, WE'RE BACK, WHY NOT? THAT WAS A CASE OF SO, YOU KNOW, D.O.D USES THIS SYSTEM I GUESS VISTA OR THEY USE ALTA? WHICH IS THE ONE THAT -- [LAUGHTER] THEY USE VISTA. AND V.A. USES ALTA. AND THAT'S THE RECORD KEEPING FOR BOTH GROUPS. SO THEY HAVE THIS COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT KEEPS TRACK OF VETERANS AT THE V.A. AND A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT KEEPS TRACK OF VETERANS AT THE DOD. THOSE SYSTEMS CAN NOT COMMUNICATE TO EACH OTHER. SO THEY SPENT I DON'T KNOW A BILLION DOLLARS AND THEY TRIED TO CONNECT THE TWO AND THEY COULDN'T. WHAT? [LAUGHTER] HOW IS THAT -- [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED IN TERMS OF  THEIR OWN REELECTION. CAN'T THEY GO TO THOSE GUYS AND SAY, HEY, HOW DID YOU SEND E-MAILS TO PEOPLE WHILE THEY SLEEP? CAN WE REALLY JUST SHRUG OUR SHOULDERS AND SAY, WELL THE CULTURE IS VERY ENTRENCHED.
I WILL TELL YOU A BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM IS TURF. SECRETARY SHINSEKI AND I GOT TOGETHER ON THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES. AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD A PATH TO CONNECT THOSE TWO AND WE WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO SOMETHING PRETTY SMART WHICH WAS OUTSOURCE THE WHOLE THING TO PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO KNEW HOW TO DO THIS STUFF.
Jon: OOH, PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW TO DO IT, INTERESTING. [ LAUGHTER ]
ONE OF THE THINGS I DISCOVERED, AND THIS MAY HAVE APPLICATION IN OTHER AREAS, IS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TRIES TO BUILD SOMETHING REALLY BIG AND REALLY COMPLICATED ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNICAL WORLD IT ALMOST ALWAYS FAILS. THIS IS NOT NEW.
Jon: BUT YET WE ARE ABLE TO AS A GOVERNMENT FIGHT 12-YEAR  WARS OVERSEAS. WE'RE ABLE AS A GOVERNMENT -- WE'RE STILL ABLE TO DO GREAT THINGS.
THE PROBLEM IS --
Jon: WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WILL, AS YOU SAID, HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO GET TO THAT POINT.
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, SHINSEKI AND I SIMPLY COULD NOT GET THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE --
Jon: RIGHT.
-- TO ABANDON THEIR  TURF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEIR INSISTENCE ON OWNING THEIR OWN SYSTEM AND NOT COMBINING THE TWO. I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FIXES MADE TO TRY AND IMPROVE THE SHARING OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS. AND MY APPROACH WAS WHEN A SOLDIER GOES FROM BEING ON ACTIVE DUTY TO VETERAN STATUS, THE VETERAN OUGHT NOT SEE ANY PROBLEM AT ALL. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE SOLDIER NOT THE GOVERNMENT. HOW DO WE PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER SO THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE DISABILITY EVALUATION. THIS WAS ONE OF THE PILOT PROJECTS WE DID. UP UNTIL RECENTLY YOU HAD TO HAVE A DISABILITY EVALUATION IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND ANOTHER ONE IN THE VETERANS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT. WE TRIED TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE'VE STARTED TO DO BUT  IT HAS TAKEN AN UNCONSCIONABLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND FRANKLY, ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE BOOK, I'M VERY OPEN WITH CRITICISM ABOUT MYSELF.
Jon: YOU RIP YOURSELF TO PIECES. I'VE SEEN SOME VERY TOUGH STUFF IN HERE.
ONE OF THE THINGS, WHERE I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT I FAILED WAS IN GETTING THESE MEDICAL BUREAUCRACIES TO WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER.
Jon: RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE HOPE FOR THAT? BECAUSE I ALMOST VIEWED IT AS, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SURGE IN IRAQ AND THE RESOURCES WE PUT TOWARDS THAT, PETREUS DOING SOME SORT OF OUT OF THE BOX THINKING AND TRYING TO CREATE A MORE AGILE ORGANIZATION THAT COULD DEAL WITH THE THINGS ON THE GROUND THAT WERE CHANGING. I THOUGHT SO MANY OF THESE GUYS ARE SO SMART, SO ENTHUSIASTIC AND SO COMMITTED AND THEY COULD GO -- FORGET ABOUT EVEN THE CONNECTIVITY AND CHANGE THESE PAPERWORKS INTO ELECTRONIC RECORDS IN A MONTH. THEY COULD GO THROUGH THERE WITH SCANNERS AND HAVE THAT DONE AND WHAT ABOUT THAT AS A SERVICE PROJECT FOR RETURNING VETERANS? WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH VETERAN UNEMPLOYMENT AND WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH VETERANS SERVICES BEING BOGGED DOWN. LOOKS TO ME LIKE YOU PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND YOU SOLVE TWO VERY CRUCIAL PROBLEMS.
ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MADE PROGRESS IS IN CONVERTING THE PAPER RECORDS TO ELECTRONIC RECORDS. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS NOW IS THE SHARING OF ELECTRONIC RECORDS. SO BEING ABLE TO SEND A SOLDIER'S RECORD ELECTRONICALLY FROM D.O.D. TO A VETERANS HOSPITAL IN OMAHA OR SOME PLACE.
Jon: WHY NOT USE THE SAME SYSTEM? IF ONLY THE ARMY HAD A COMMANDER IN CHIEF, LIKE A GUY THAT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE THING WHO COULD SAY TO D.O.D., USE THEIR COMPUTER? IS THAT NOT POSSIBLE?
WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT I GOT WHICH WAS IT WON'T WORK AND WE'D HAVE TO SPEND THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. FRANKLY THE ARGUMENTS WERE NOT COMPELLING. BUT AS I ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE BOOK, I JUST COULD NOT GET EVEN THE D.O.D. BUREAUCRACY THAT HANDLES THESE KINDS OF AFFAIRS TO THINK FRESHLY. I SAY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TACKLE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING ARE THE VETERANS SITTING OUT THERE WAITING TWO, THREE, FOUR YEARS TO GET A DISABILITY. THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT I HAD WAS THAT I FELT PARTICULARLY FOR SOLDIERS FOR SERVICE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WOUNDED IN COMBAT THAT THE DISABILITY EVALUATION ITSELF WAS ARTIFICIALLY PRECISE.
Jon: IT'S CONTRIVED, I THINK, WHAT, 30%.
YOU DON'T GET A BENEFIT UNLESS YOU ARE 30% DISABLED. SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 28% DISABLED AND  30% DISABLED. OR 32% DISABLED? I SAID THIS IS BALONEY. IF IT'S A WOUNDED WARRIOR, LET'S ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE SOLDIER. LET'S COME BACK AND RE-EVALUATE IN FIVE YEARS AND IF THAT RATING ISN'T JUSTIFIED WE CAN CHANGE IT BUT LET'S ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE SOLDIER AND BOTH PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SUPPORTED THAT. BUT, AGAIN, IT REQUIRED A CHANGE IN THE LAW AND WE JUST DIDN'T GET IT DONE.
Jon: IT'S REALLY WILD. HERE IS THE UNFORTUNATE PART ABOUT IT. BECAUSE THEN THE PERCEPTION BECOMES FOR THE SOLDIERS THIS COUNTRY CARES ABOUT ME GREATLY WHEN I'M FIGHTING FOR IT BUT THE MINUTE I PUT MY GUN DOWN, I GO AWAY. AND THAT BECOMES, I THINK, IN MANY WAYS HEARTBREAKING TO THESE GUYS AND WOMEN.
THE UPSIDE ON THAT THOUGH, JON, IS THAT VERY MUCH UNLIKE VIETNAM, AMERICAN SOCIETY HAS REACTED BETTER IN SOME WAYS THAN OUR GOVERNMENT HAS.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION.
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES, A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS, A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN TRYING TO FIND VETERANS JOBS. I GIVE MRS. OBAMA AND MRS. BIDEN CREDIT FOR THE EFFORT THEY'VE PUT IN TO TRYING TO FIND JOBS FOR VETERANS AND GET BUSINESSES ORGANIZED. SO THE UPSIDE IS, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL WRAPPED AROUND THE AXLE ON THE ISSUE, SOCIETY ITSELF IS TAKING A LOT BETTER CARE OF THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THAN THEIR GOVERNMENT IS IN MANY CASES.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY.
THANK YOU.
Jon: GET THE BOOK. IT'S BIG, YOU CAN PUT THINGS ON IT. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES. ROBERT GATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
