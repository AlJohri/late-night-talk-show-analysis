Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY  GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE  FOUNDER AND C.E.O. OF THE MISSION CONTINUE, A  NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT  WORKS WITH MILITARY  VETERANS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE  PROGRAM ERIC GREITENS. (APPLAUSE)
HOW ARE YOU.
WE'RE GREAT, DOING VERY  WELL.
BEFORE WE GET STARTED A  WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A SMALL  SENSE OF WE ARE DEALING WITH, ARE YOU A NAVY SEAL, BEEN  DEPLOYED FOUR TIME.
FOUR TIMES YOU ARE A  DOCTOR.
I'M GOING TO GO WITH  OXFORD. YOU ARE A RODE SCHOLAR.
YEAH.
YOU HAVE A BLACK BELT IN  TIE KWAN DO.
I AM NEVER LETTING YOU  MEET MY WIFE. HOW ARE YOU.
I'M DOING GREAT, DOING  GREAT, DOING WELL.
Jon: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT  THIS, THE PROGRAM THAT YOU  HAVE, THIS MISSION CONTINUES I FEEL LIKE SAY  REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAM THAT  IS SO INTUITIVE I CAN'T  BELIEVE IT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE BUT EXPLAIN VERY  QUICKLY THE IDEA BEHIND THE  COMMISSION?
THE MISSION CONTINUES IS  A NATIONAL SERVICE  ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS POST 9/11 VETERANS TRANSITION  FROM THE MILITARY TO SERVICE  AND LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS HERE AT HOME WE BELIEVE THIS  GENERATION OF VETERANS ARE  ASSETS TO THE COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THEY COME BACK  WITH GREAT EXPERIENCE AND  SKILLS. AND WE PUT THEM THROUGH AN  INTENSIVE SIX MONTH SERVICE  AND LEADERSHIP PLACEMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHERE THEY  START WORKING WITH HABITAT  FOR HUMANITY, WITH BIG  BROTHER, BIG SISTER, THE BOYS & GIRLS CLUB AND THEY  START SERVING AGAIN HERE AT  HOME.
RIGHT.
AND THAT --
SO HERE'S WHAT I THINK IS  SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT. THE IMMEDIATE REFLEX ON THE  PART OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,  AND I THINK IT'S A  WELL-INTENTIONED ONE S HOW DO WE HELP THESE PEOPLE? THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE  GIVEN SO MUCH TO THIS  COUNTRY. WE WANT TO GIVE THEM  SOMETHING. BUT THE TRUTH IS WITHIN THEM  ASK THE DESIRE TO CONTINUE  SERVING US.
YES. WHEN THEY COME HOME THEY  WANT TO FIND A WAY TO  CONTINUE TO SERVE. AND A LOT OF THESE MEN AND  WOMEN WHEN THEY LEAVE THE  MILITARY THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SENSE OF PURPOSE,  ACCOMPLISHMENT, CAMARADERIE  THEY HAD IN THE MILITARY. WHAT HAPPENS IS A LOT OF  GOOD PEOPLE, THEY COME FROM  A GOOD PLACE, GOOD  INTENTIONS BUT START GIVING THINGS TO VETERANS. THEY GIVE THEM FREE BASEBALL  TICKETS, FREE HALFIE TICKETS,  THEY GIVE THEM GIFT BASKETS AND BLANKETS. YOU CAN IMAGINE, A  23-YEAR-OLD MARINE, MAYBE  YOU WERE INJURED IN IRAQ OR  AFGHANISTAN. YOU COME BACK-- .
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING I CAN  IMAGINE BEING A 23-YEAR-OLD  MARINE.
WELL, MAYBE, MAYBE. THEY COME BACK, AND WHAT  HAPPENS IS WHEN PEOPLE START  GIVING THEM STUFF THEY START TO INTERNALIZE THE IDEA THAT  THEY ARE CHARITY CASES. AND THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A  HANDOUT. THIS GENERATION OF VETERANS  WANTS TO FIND A WAY TO  CONTINUE TO SERVE.
Jon: AN HERE WE ARE IN A  COUNTRY THAT IS DESPERATELY  IN NEED OF THAT ETHOS AND WE HAVE MYRIAD PROBLEMS GOING  ON IN THE COUNTRY. IT SEEMS LIKE A PERFECT  MATCH. IT'S ALMOST AS IF WE HAVE  THESE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  OF INCREDIBLY DEDICATED  SMART, TENACIOUS INDIVIDUALS COMING BACK TO THE COUNTRY,  LOOKING TO SERVE, A COUNTRY  THAT NEEDS THIS SERVICE. WHY IS IT DIFFICULT TO PUT  THOSE TWO ENTITIES TOGETHER  AGAIN?
WE FOUND THAT IT'S  ACTUALLY WORKING REALLY  WELL. SO THROUGH THE MISSION  CONTINUES YOU'VE GOT  HUNDREDS OF VETERANS WHO ARE  COMING BACK. AND WHEN THEY GET ENGAGE  APPROXIMATED IN THEIR  COMMUNITIES, THESE ARE MEN  AND WOMEN LIKE TONY, AN AIR FORCE EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE  TECHNICIAN, ACTUALLY  DIFFUSING BOMBS IN PLACES  LIKE IRAQ, HE COMES BACK AND HE WORKS IN D.C. IN THE  DEPARTMENT OF VOLUNTEERISM. HE GAUGES OTHER PEOPLE, GETS  THEM TO START TO SERVE  AGAIN. NATIONALLY WILLIAMS WAS A  NURSE, WAS SERVING IN THE  UNITED STATES NAVY, A  CORPSMEN AND HORRIBLE COMBAT ACCIDENT, HAD A PROPELLER  RUN THROUGH HER FACE. SHE LOST HER RIGHT EYE,  SEVERELY INJURED. CAME BACK HOME AND SHE WAS  STRUGGLING. PEOPLE WEREN'T REACHING OUT  TO HER. SHE WAS A MOTHER. THE BEST JOB SHE HAD WAS  WORKING AT A TOY STORE. WE STARTED AT THE MISSION  CONTINUES, WE ACTUALLY ASKED  HER TO START TO SERVE AGAIN. WE CREATED A FELLOWSHIP WITH  HER FOR HER AT CHILDREN'S  HOSPITAL IN ST. LOUIS  MISSOURI AND TODAY SHE IS WORKING THERE FULL-TIME.
TREMENDOUS.
Jon: TREMENDOUS IDEA. AND WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT IT,  YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO  EXPAND IT BEYOND ITS  CAPACITY AT THIS POINT. BUT I CONDITION HELP BUT  WONDER IF LOCALITY, STATE,  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  REQUEST ENGAGE WITH YOU GUYS, THERE'S ALMOST THIS MENU,  YOU ARE CREATING ALMOST  THESE, I GUESS YOU CALL THEM  PLATOONS, YES.
YES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  SERVICE PLATOONS ALL OVER  THE COUNTRY.
RIGHT.
WHERE MISSION CONTINUES  FELLOWS ARE ENGAGING THEIR  FELLOW VETERANS AND WE THINK THIS CAN REALLY BE 9 LECH  SEE OF THIS GENERATION OF  VETERANS.
UH-HUH.
THAT 10, 20 YEARS FROM  NOW WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT  THIS GENERATION OF VETERANS THEY THINK OF A GROUP THAT  SERVED OVERSEAS AND CAME  BACK HOME AND THEY CONTINUED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN  THEIR COMMUNITY.
IF YOU CAN NATION BUILD  IN AFGHANISTAN, YOU CAN DO  IT IN CHICAGO.
YOU CAN. YOU CAN.
OBVIOUSLY CHICAGO A  LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS. BUT STILL.
BUT STILL, YES, YES.
IT CAN BE DONE.
IT CAN BE DONE.
NOW WHEN THEY COME BACK,  I THINK THE OTHER  INTERESTING THING THAT YOU  TOUCH UPON WAS THAT YD OF CAMARADERIE AND NOT ONLY ARE  THEY SERVING THE COMMUNITY,  THEY'RE SERVING EACH OTHER.
YES.
BECAUSE NO ONE  UNDERSTANDS THAT SITUATION  LIKE A FELLOW VETERANS.
RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT AN ALL  VOLUNTEER FORCE. AS YOU KNOW LESS THAN 1% OF  THE COUNTRY IS SET FOOT IN  PLACES LIKE IRAQ OR  AFGHANISTAN. WHEN THEY COME HOME AND  START TO SERVE AGAIN, THEY  ALSO START SUPPORTING EACH  OTHER. AND WHAT WE FOUND AT THE  MISSION CONTINUES IS THAT  THEY ARE ACTUALLY FORMING  THEIR OWN PLAT ON IN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO, AND SAN DIEGO  AND ST. LOUIS AND HOUSTON  AND BOSTON AMOUNT OF. AND THEY COME TOGETHER AND  START TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER,  LET'S SAY IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEIR BENEFITS  YOU GOT TO SEE THIS FIRST. IF YOU NEED THE RIGHT  PHYSICAL THERAPY, GO SEE  THIS PARTICULAR DOCTOR. AND THEY START TO ACTUALLY  SERVE TOGETHER AND HELP EACH  OTHER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.
HOW DO VETERANS FIND  THEIR WAY BECAUSE THE OTHER  SIDE OF PUTTING TOGETHER THESE PROGRAMS IS THE  OUTREACH TO VETERANS TO GET  THEM INVOLVED IN THIS. HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE  ACCOMPLISHED?
SO ANY VETERAN IS  AVAILABLE, IF THEY WANT TO  GO OFF TO MISSION  CONTINUES.ORG. GO OUT TO MISSION CONTINUES  .ORG AND LEARN ABOUT WHAT WE  ARE DOING TO ENGAGE VETERANS IN SERVICE, THAT'S THE FIRST  THING. AVAILABLE TO ANY POST 9/11  VETERAN, COME OUT TO THE WEB  SITE. BUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY  HAPPENING, WE'RE FINDING, IS  THAT OVER HALF OF THE PEOPLE  WHO ARE JOINING OUR PROGRAM ARE COMING AT REFERRALLALS  TO THE CURRENT PEOPLE IN OUR  PROGRAM AND THEY ARE SAYING LOOK, THIS REALLY CHANGED MY  LIFE. I CAME BACK HOME. I STARTED SERVING AGAIN. I REBUILT A SENSE OF HURPS. I FIGURED OUT HOW I COULD  USE MY SKILLS IN A CIVILIAN  CONTEXT AND THEY ARE  REFERRING THEIR FRIENDS THAT THEY SERVED WITH OR MIGHT  HAVE BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL W  THEY ARE COMING BACK AND  SERVING AGAIN.
WELL, IT'S-- WHAT YOU ARE  DOING IS INCREDIBLY  REMARKABLE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW  INSPIRING IT IS FOR ME TO  SEE. AND FOR YOU GUYS TO. AND THE EXAMPLES OF HOW IT  ACTUALLY, PRACTICALLY IS  WORKING. AND IT'S REALLY WONDERFUL. SO CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
ERIC GREITENS, MISSION  CONTINUES.ORG. CHECK IT OUT.
