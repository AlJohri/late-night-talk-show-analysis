Jon: THERE ARE SOME WARS, THERE ARE SOME WARS SO GRISLY AND HEARTBREAKING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THEM.
BIRDS ALL OVER AMERICA ARE DYING. BAFFLING SCIENTISTS. BUT NOW GEORGE EP FENWAY OF THE AMERICAN BIRD CONSERVANCY THINKS THE REASON COULD BE IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS.
CATS.
CATS?
YES, CATS KILL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BIRDS.
IS THIS WHY BIRDS ARE SO ANGRY? (LAUGHTER)
I THINK ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF BIRDS ARE ACTUALLY MORE FEARFUL OF CATS BECAUSE CATS ARE  SUPERPRIDD TERS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BIRDS.
SO I REACHED OUT TO THE CATS. BUT THEY WOULD ONLY SPEAK TO ME THROUGH THEIR MONEYED LOBBYIST.
CATS ARE PART. ECOSYSTEM AND THEY ARE NOT THE REAL THREAT. THERE IS POLLUTION, THERE'S URBAN SPRAWL, THERE'S DEVELOPMENT, AND THERE ARE  OTHER BIRDS THAT KILL BIRDS.
SO THERE'S BIRD ON BIRD VIOLENCE.
ABSOLUTELY.
THERE IS SOME BIRD ON BIRD VIOLENCE, HAWKS KILL BIRDS, THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THAT'S NATURAL. THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIRDS HAVE EVOLVED OVER A  MILLENNIA WHERE CATS ARE NOT NATIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SO CATS ARE LIKE IMMIGRANTS. CATS ARE DEFINITELY IMMIGRANTS.
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LIE AROUND AND TAKE HANDOUTS WHEN THEY ARE  NOT COMMITTING CRIMES.
THEY MADE THEIR HOME HERE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ACCEPTED.
IF YOU OWN A CAT, KEEP IT INDOORS. UNOWNED CATS NEED TO BE CAPTURED AND REMOVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.
THEY WERE STIRRING ARGUMENTS. BUT ONE THING STILL TROUBLED ME.
WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT BIRDS AGAIN?
WE CARE ABOUT BIRDS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD FOR US.
DO WE REALLY NEED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MORE BIRDS.
YES.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO NEW YORK CITY. THAT PLACE IS COVERED IN BIRD [BLEEP].
BUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE LALA WILDS WHO LOVES CATS AND BIRD APPROXIMATES, THIS  INTRACTABLE WAR HAS BEEN DEVASTATING.
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD TO MAKE A SOPHIE'S CHOICE OF CATS OR BIRDS, I AM GOING TO  HAVE TO TAKE CATS.
YOU KNOW SOPHIE'S CHOICE, I THINK ORIGINALLY THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ABOUT, TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A CAT AND A BIRD.
FORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COME TO THAT. THERE WAS HELP IN THE FORM OF ANIMAL PLANET'S CAT WHISPERER JACKSON GAL AXY.
WE COULD START DIRECTING THAT IMPULSE TOWARDS MORE APPROPRIATE VICTIMS, YOU  KNOW, LIKE TOYS.
OKAY.
NOW WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF TOYS, RIGHT THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN INTERACTIVE TOY. LOOK AT THAT, SEE.
WAIT, JUST STOP FOR A SECOND. YOU CARRY AROUND A GUITAR CASE.
YEAH, I DO.
EVEN ARE YOU EMBARRASSED ABOUT BEING A CAT WHISPERER. YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO THINK ARE YOU IN A --
BUT LALA'S CAT DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE AND CONTINUED TO DEFIANTLY HUNT BIRDS.
SINCE NO OUTSIDE MEDIATOR COULD BRING PEACE, THERE WAS ONE LAST OPTION.
CAT WHITION PERER THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO END THIS CONFLICT. THEY HAVE TO TALK IT OUT. CAT, BIRD, YOU HAVE TO TALK THIS OUT. WE'LL BE BACK.
OH, COME ON, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THE BIRD DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO MAKE A DEAL. HE JUST TAKES OFF, JUST FLEW A WHAT. WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY WITH HIM.
IT WASN'T A TALKING THING --
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM? WHY DID HE TAKE OFF?
AND SO SADLY THE WAR RAGES ON
