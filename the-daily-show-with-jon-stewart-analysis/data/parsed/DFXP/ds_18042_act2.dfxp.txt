TY COBB. HE WAS A SCOUNDREL BUT AMAZING  PLAYER. HE IS IN.
Jon: NOT SO MUCH A  SCOUNDREL A RACIST ACTUALLY BUT  HE GOT IN 1936 BEFORE BLACK PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO PLAY IN  MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. IF EVERYONE ELSE IS RACIST DOES  THAT MEAN YOU ARE RACIST? IT DOES, ACTUALLY YOU JUST TAKE  A LOT LESS (bleep) FOR BEING  RACIST. IT'S LIKE WEARING SPAC TRY THAT  NOW. THIS ISN'T A BIG DEAL. NOBODY GOT IN. I GET WHY THEY PASSED UP  MONSTERS INC.
