[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE FORMER  CHAIRMAN AND C.E.O. OF AT&T AND  GM. HIS BOOK IS CALLED" AMERICAN  TURNAROUND, REINVENTING AT&T AND  THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS IN THE  U.S.A. PLEASE WELCOME ED WHITACRE. HELLO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SO YOU ACTUALLY RAN  GM -- YOU WERE ASKED TO RUN IT  POST BAILOUT. IN THE BAILOUT THEY CALLED YOU  AND SAID, HEY, MAN, WHAT ARE YOU  UP TO? COME ON IN.
THEY CALLED ME AND SAID WE'RE  GOING TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY,  WILL YOU COME RUN GM.
Jon: IN THAT MOMENT WHAT  WERE YOU DOING AT THAT TIME?
NOTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO HOW DID YOU WEIGH  THOSE OPTIONS? NOTHING, GM, YOU WENT WITH GM.
I WENT WITH GM. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH.
Jon: YOU HAD ONLY RUN AT&T,  SO -- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:   ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES FOR GM AND THE TAXPAYER BAILOUT WAS THAT  PRIVATE MONEY WOULD NOT HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO BAIL THEM OUT, THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO STEP IN. IS THAT TRUE AT THAT TIME?
THAT'S TRUE. NOBODY STEPPED UP WITH MONEY  FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
Jon: SO THAT IS TRUE?
THAT IS TRUE.
Jon: SO I WASN'T A  SOCIALIST TAKEOVER FROM THE  GETGO? IT WAS NOT. NOBODY STEPPED UP WITH PRIVATE  MONEY.
Jon: IT JUST TURNED INTO  ONE. HOLD ON A SECOND. LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  WHAT ABOUT  AFTER THE GOVERNMENT PUT MONEY  IN IT AND THEY STARTED TO TURN THINGS AROUND, COULD THERE HAVE  BEEN AN IPO AT THAT TIME THAT  COULD HAVE RAISED THE -- WHAT DID WE PUT IN $43 BILLION?
ABOUT $50 BILLION.
Jon: I ALWAYS ROUND DOWN.
IT'S A BIG NUMBER.
Jon: DID -- IF THEY HAD  DONE AN IPO EARLIER COULD THE  TAXPAYER HAVE GOTTEN THEIR MONEY BACK, MAYBE A LITTLE NICE PROFIT  THERE? I KNOW THEY DID AN IPO FOR HALF  OF THAT?
HAD WE DONE THE IPO AND THE  GOVERNMENT SOLD ITS ENTIRE  SHARE, WE THE TAXPAYER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE BACK BUT WE'RE  ON THE PATH TO GET IT ALL BACK. COULDN'T DO AN IPO EARLIER THAN  WE DID BECAUSE HE YOU HAVE TO SEE  FINANCIALS, IS GM MAKING S  MONEY? NOT MAKING MONEY? HOW IS IT GOING? IS IT GOING TO SURVIVE? HOW ARE THE VEHICLES? YOU COULDN'T DO ILL EARLIER.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A  QUESTION:  HOW ARE THEIR  VEHICLES?
THE BEST.
Jon: NOW, WHY DIDN'T THEY  DO THAT BEFORE? [LAUGHTER] WHY DID THEY WAIT UNTIL THEY GOT  BANKRUPT? [LAUGHTER] SORRY THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THAT IPO THING THAT IS  INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE -- SO  IN THAT IPO WHY DIDN'T WE DO IT? DID THE ADMINISTRATION NOT WANT  THEIR MONEY BACK AT THAT TIME,  THEY WANTED TO WAIT A LITTLE  BIT?
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SELL ALL  THEIR STOCK BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T. WHY, YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM, I  DON'T KNOW.
Jon: JUDGING FROM THEIR  RECORD, I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY  ARE GOING TO TELL ME. [ LAUGHTER ] WOULD YOU HAVE LIKED TO HAVE --  IF YOU WERE RUNNING US, WOULD  YOU HAVE SOLD AT THAT IPO?
I WOULD HAVE, YES.
Jon: YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T  SELL AT THE IPO BECAUSE THEY  WANTED TO HAVE INFLUENCE OR THEY DIDN'T TRUST IN THE DECISION TO  DO IT? THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK  OUT SO THEY JUST PICKED RUN OR  THEY WANT AID HAND IN RUNNING  GM?
YOU KNOW, THEY WERE GREAT. THEY LET US AT GM RUN GM. WE GOT NO INTERFERENCE FROM THE  GOVERNMENT. IT WAS TERRIFIC. THEY WERE GREAT PARTNERS. THEY JUST LET US BRING IT BACK. WE ALL WORKED TOGETHER. WE GOT VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE,  VERY LITTLE HELP -- WE GOT NONE. THEY LET US DO IT.
Jon: I HAVE TO TELL YOU:  I  THINK A GREAT PARTNER IN  BUSINESS WOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT GIVES YOU $50 BILLION AND  DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING AFTER THAT.
IT WAS GREAT.
Jon: I WOULD LIKE A PARTNER  LIKE THAT.
IT WAS GREAT.
Jon: THEY DIDN'T -- DID  THEY PUT PRESSURE ON GM TO SAY  WE WANT MORE ECONOMICAL CARS. WE WANT THE CHEVY VOLT -- WE  WANT TO MAKE THAT OR THE --
THE VOLT.
Jon: WE WANT TO MAKE THAT A  CENTERPIECE OR THAT WAS A  DECISION MADE WITHIN GM.
THAT WAS A GM DECISION. COMPANIES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY  TO EXPLORE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND  DO THINGS WITH ALL THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CLIMATE AND  ENVIRONMENT. THAT WAS DONE IN GM AND IT'S A  GREAT VEHICLE.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. SO YOU ARE HAPPY WITH THE  ARRANGEMENT?
YEAH, THEY LET US DO IT.
Jon: WHEN YOU WENT IN  THERE, HOW DIFFICULT FOR YOU?   YOU HAD NOT RUN A CAR COMPANY  PREVIOUSLY? [LAUGHTER]
NEVER.
Jon: YOU ARE THE MOST  GENIAL GUY THAT HAS RUN THESE  COMPANIES. THERE'S A BUNCH OF GUYS THERE 20  YEARS, 30 YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN  WORKING HARD. YOU WALK IN AND YOU'VE RUN A  COMPANY BUT IT'S AT&T. ARE THEY MAD AT YOU? ARE THEY MEAN TO YOU? HOW DO YOU GET THEIR TRUST,  RESPECT AND ENTHUSIASM?
I ASKED WHAT WENT WRONG AT  GM. ONE OF THE ANSWERS WAS WE DIDN'T  DO ANYTHING WRONG, THE ECONOMY  GOT US. IT WAS INTERESTING I SAID IT  DIDN'T GET A LOT OF OTHER CAR  COMPANIES, YOU KNOW SO WHY DID IT PICK ON US.
Jon: WHERE DID THE MEETING  GO FROM THERE?
SORT OF DOWNHILL FROM THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: RIGHT. WHAT WAS YOUR DUE DILIGENCE  CENTER FIELD HOW LONG DID YOU  SPEND THERE GAINING THE INFORMATION YOU NEEDED TO START  MAKING DECISIONS TO REORGANIZE  THE COMPANY?
I WAS APPOINTED CHAIRMAN IN  AUGUST, NOT C.E.O. I BECAME C.E.O. IN DECEMBER. I SPENT THE TIME FROM AUGUST TO  DECEMBER STUDYING THE COMPANY.
Jon: AND HOW LONG DID IT  TAKE -- IT WAS -- YOU WRITE A  LOT ABOUT HOW IT WAS ORGANIZED IN AN AK TEN TRICK WAY, IN A WAY  THAT YOU DID NOT THINK WAS  RATIONAL.
RIGHT. IT WAS MATRIX MANAGEMENT TO THE  HILT. EVERYBODY REPORTED TO EVERYBODY  ELSE AND NOBODY REPORTED TO  ANYBODY AND NOBODY HAD A BOSS. IT WAS BUREAUCRATIC AND  CONFUSED.
Jon: NO ACCOUNTABILITY. JOB ONE WAS THE ACCOUNTABILITY. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD TURN  AROUND ANY COMPANY? DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S A  METHODOLOGY TO IT THAT WOULD  WORK ON ANYTHING?
WELL, I THINK I COULD MAKE IT  BETTER, YES. I THINK THAT'S BETTER. YOU GIVE THEM RESPONSIBILITY,  AUTHORITY AND YOU HOLD PEOPLE  ACCOUNTABLE AND PARTICIPATE IN IT TOGETHER. THINGS GET BETTER. PEOPLE ARE THE BEST ASSET.
Jon: TELL ME MORE ABOUT  THESE PEOPLE YOU SPEAK OF?
THAT'S ANY PEOPLE.
Jon: I LIKE THE SOUND OF  IT. DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES TO  STICK AROUND? SURE.
Jon: AMERICA'S TURNAROUND  IT'S ON THE
