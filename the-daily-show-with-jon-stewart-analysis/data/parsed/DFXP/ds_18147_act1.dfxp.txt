FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)      Captioning sponsored by       COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT,  MY GUEST MICHAEL C. HALL,  HANDSOME AND SCARY AT THE SAME TIME. THAT'S NOT EASY TO PULL OFF. LET'S BEGIN IN NEW YORK CITY. THE MAYORAL RACE, IT'S THE  SUBJECT OF OUR NEW  SEGMENT INDECISION 2013  - HEY I'M VOTIN' HERE . (LAUGHTER)  THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S  MINDS WHO WILL FILL MAYOR  MICHAEL BLOOMBERG'S SHOES, HIS TINY, TINY SHOES. (LAUGHTER)  HE'S VERY SMALL. YOU KNOW I HAVE A PAIR OF HIS  SHOES RIGHT HERE. I TOOK THEM FROM HIS ARMOIRE  I HAVE HIS ARMOIRE   AS WELL. THERE WE ARE, THERE ARE HIS  LITTLE SHOES. I'M MICHAEL BLOOMBERG. I'M GOING TO WORK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ACTUALLY, VERY  INTERESTING. HE PUTS THESE ON EVERY  MORNING AND COMMUTES TO WORK  ON THE SUBWAY. RAT, HE RIDES A RAT BECAUSE  HE'S TINY. IT'S FUNNY STORY, WE'RE  ACTUALLY THE SAME SIZE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT I'M ACTUALLY OBVIOUSLY I  CAN'T TAKE THE SUBWAY I'M  TOO FAMOUS. I FLY A PIGEON TO WORK. (LAUGHTER)  BUT MR. BLOOMBERG'S THIRD  TERM ENDS THIS YEAR. SO HE IS DONE UNLESS HE  MANAGES TO PULL A PUTIN  WHICH-- NO, NOT THAT, NOT  RIDING AROUND WITH HIS NIPPULAR'S SHOWING. I MEAN JUST HANGING AROUND  NOT LEAVING. WHO SHALL TAKE MAYOR  BLOOMBERG'S CASE.
DEMOCRATS GATHERED TUESDAY  FOR THE FINAL DEBATE AND  FACED A TOUGH LINE OF  QUESTIONING.
WHEN DID ALL OF YOU LAST  TAKE THE SUBWAY.
GIVE US A RECENT EXAMPLE  OF YOUR OWN PERSONAL  STRUGGLE TO GET BY.
SHOULD BICYCLISTS HAVE TO  PASS A TEST AND HAVE A  LICENSE.
DO YOU COMPOST? (LAUGHTER)
OKAY, TWO THINGS. ONE, COMPOST? WHAT DO YOU THINK, THESE  GUYS ARE RUNNING FOR MAYOR  OF BURNING MAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, COMPOST? (LAUGHTER)
WHAT'S ON YOUR IPOD? AND I GUESS THE SECOND  QUESTION WOULD BE THIS, HOW  LARGE IS BILL DE BLASIO. DID THAT GUY FALL RIGHT OFF  A BEAN STALK? I MEAN SERIOUSLY. IF DE BLASIO WINS THERE WILL  BE THE GREATEST INCUMBENT  SUCCESSOR INAUGURAL SIZE DISCREPANCY IN THE HISTORY  OF SWEARING IN CEREMONIES. I MEAN, LOOK--   (LAUGHTER)  I GOT TO ASK YOU THIS. HOW DOES A GUY DE BLASIO'S  SIZE GET TO WORK. I MEAN HE IS-- OH, REALLY,  OH. (LAUGHTER)  I GUESS THE RATS DO GET  QUITE LARGE, SO-- WELL,  THESE DEBATES AREN'T JUST ABOUT ISSUES. THEY ARE ABOUT LETTING YOUR  PERSONALITY SHINE THROUGH.
DO YOU HAVE A HOUSEKEEPER,  MR. DE BLASIO.
SOMETIMES, FROM TIME TO  TIME.
MS. QUINN.
ONCE A WEEK, YES.
ONCE A WEEK AND THEN I  CLEAN UP AFTER HER WHEN  SHE'S DONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THERE'S THAT CHARM  THAT BORDERS ON THE EDGE OF  DICKISHNESS. (LAUGHTER)  ANTHONY WEINER, FORMER  CONGRESSMAN, TURNED AMATEUR  PHOTOGRAPHER--   (LAUGHTER) HE'S REALLY ABOUT 10% MAN  AND 90% GRISTLE AT THIS  POINT. [BLEEP] HIS MAYORAL  CAMPAIGN WAS DESIGNED AS A  HUMBLE BID FOR NEW YORK  VOTERS' REDEMPTION AND FORGIVENESS BUT NOW IT IS  SOMEWHAT NOTICEABLY CURVED A  BIT TO THE RIGHT A WAY FROM THAT PREMISE.
REALLY? IS IT AMBITION, A HUNGER FOR  THE BIG JOB, THE POWER?
HARD TO TAKE YOU  SERIOUSLY, A HUNGER FOR THE  BIG JOB. I HAVE A FEELING I STEPPED  INTO A MONTY PYTHON BIT.
THE PARADE GETS UNDER  WAY.
VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE! IF I IF I AM FROM JAMAICA?
Jon: CALL ME BANANA, AM I  RIGHT, HUH? COOL RUNNINGS. AH, SERIOUSLY, YOU PEOPLE  SOUND RIDICULOUS, VOTE FOR  ME! FOR MORE OF ANTHONY WEINER'S  ALIENATION OF VOTERS WE'RE  JOINED BY JESSICA WILLIAMS IN HARLEM. ANY SIGN OF ANTHONY WEINER  CAMPAIGNING UP THERE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE WAS JUST HERE, JON. HE BLEW THROUGH LIKE AN [BLEEP] TORNADO. AND I CAN'T QUITE DESCRIBE  WHAT I JUST SAW SO I TOOK A  PICTURE ON MY PHONE. (LAUGHTER)  JON, I GUESS HE'S TRYING TO  APPEAL TO THE BLACK VOTE BUT  WE HAVEN'T DRESSED LIKE THAT SINCE, UM, NEVER. (LAUGHTER)  WE ARE NEVER DRESSED LIKE  THAT IN THE HISTORY OF TIME. UNLESS WE'RE THE HARLEM  GLOBETROTTERS AND WE'RE  VISITING SCOOBY DOO IN A  VERY SPECIAL EPISODE. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT  THAT THING NEXT TO HIM IS. BUT I HAVE A THEORY THAT  IT'S SOME SORT OF SOUND  BRIEFCASE.
Jon: GOOD TO KNOW. I HAVE SEEN THOSE THAT'S A  BOOM BOX.
THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.
Jon: WELL, IT'S A LITTLE  BIT.
JON, JON.
Jon: I'M SORRY, AASIF  MANDVI.
YEAH, I AM--
I'M HERE IN MURRAY HILL.
Jon: YEAH.
WHERE ANTHONY WEINER HAS  JUST COMPLETELY LOST THE  INDIAN VOTE.
Jon: WHAT DID HE DO?
WELL, THINGS WERE GOING  GREAT. HE WAS HAVING DINNER WITH A  FEW INDIAN CONSTITUENTS AND  OUT OF NOWHERE HE DIPS HIS SAMOSA IN HIS MANGO NUT  LASSI! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED  TO DO WITH IT.
DRINK IT!
Jon: WHAT IS THE GREEN  STUFF.
THAT'S FOR THE SAMOSA.
Jon: OKAY, I'M SORRY! WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO  WITH THE PINKISH ONION  LOOKING THING.
YOU DON'T TOUCH THOSE,  NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THOSE ARE  FOR.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T  REALIZE.
JON . YES, AL MADRIGAL, I  ASSUME ANTHONY WEINER HAS  DONE SOMETHING TO PISS OFF THE LATINO COMMUNITY WHAT IS  IT THE CARLOS DANGER  THING.
Jon: WHAT THE HELL IS  THAT?
THAT'S THE DANGER SONG? IN SPANISH. WE'RE ACTUALLY FLATTERED BY  THE WHOLE CARLOS DANGER  THING. HE COULD HAVE PICKED FRANCOIS DEGERE, OR SEAMUS  MCDANGER  OR FYVESH  McDANGERBERG BUT HE CHOSE US, I  THINK I'M VOTING FOR HIM.
I'M SORRY, HOLD ON A  SECOND.
I CAN'T BELIEVE-- .
Jon: WHAT DID HE DO, WHAT  IS IT.
I JUST GOT A MASS TEXT  FROM THE WEINER CAMPAIGN,  HE'S TRYING TO GET THE LATINOS TO THE POLLS. BUT LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.
Jon: I DON'T-- OH, WOW. (LAUGHTER)  SOME SORT OF WEIRD SPEEDY  GONZALEZ DICK PIC?
YES, WE DO NOT PUT  SOMBREROS ON OUR PENISES.
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HELP  PROTECT IT FROM THE SUN.
Jon: THANK YOU, AL   AL MADRIGAL, AASIF MANDVI  AND JESSICA WILLIAMS. TO YOU LOOK, WEINER HAS  ALIENATED -- -- I THOUGHT  FOR A SECOND WHEN HE SAID HE  DIPS HIS SAMOSA IN A MANGO LASSI I THOUGHT IT WAS ALSO  A EUPHEMISM BUT I GUESS IT  WASN'T. WEINER IS ALIENATING VOTERS BUT  NOT HIS BASE, IT'S NOT LIKE  HE IS GOING INTO A KOSHER BAKERY ON HIGH HOLY DAYS AND  YELLING AT A GUY IN A YALMULKE
WHAT HAVE I TOLD THAT YOU  ARE YOU MY JUDGE.
YOU'RE FINE.
YOU TALK TO GOD AND WORK  OUT YOUR PROBLEMS BUT STAY  OUT OF THE PUBLIC  EYE. THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE ELECTIONS.
AND YOU'RE PERFECT,  YOU'RE GOING TO JUDGE ME.
I'M NOT RUNNING FOR  OFFICE.
YOU KNOW WHO JUDGES ME? YOU KNOW WHO JUDGES ME? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE VOTERS OF NEW  YORK CITY? EVERYTHING THAT WEINER DOES  JUST LOOKS BAD NOW. THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT  (APPLAUSE)  I MEAN FOR GOD'S SAKES WHAT  ARE YOU YELLING AT THIS GUY  FOR. IT'S NOT LIKE HE INSULTED  HIS WIFE, OH, REALLY ROLL  THAT TAPE.
EMBATTLED NEW YORK  MAYORAL CANDIDATE ANTHONY  WEINER IN AN EPIC WAR OF  WORDS AT THIS BROOKLYN BAKERY AFTER HE PAID FOR  SOME TRADITIONAL ROSH  HASHANAH BAKED GOODS.
REAL SCUM BAG.
VERY NICE.
WEINER BEGINS TO LEAVE  THE BAKERY BUT THEN, LISTEN  CLOSELY.
THIS MAN SAUL KESSLER  MAKES A RACIAL SLUR ABOUT  WEINER'S WIFE HUMA ABADINE
Jon: AH. WELL THEN [BLEEP] THAT GUY. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OF COURSE, IT DOES RAISE AN  INTERESTING POSSIBILITY. WHAT IF EVERYTHING ANTHONY  WEINER HAS DONE MAKES SENSE  IF YOU LOOK AT IT A LARGER  CONTEXT. WHAT IF THERE IS ONE PIECE  OF INFORMATION THAT MAKES  EACH INCIDENT OKAY. LIKE WHAT IF AT THAT WEST  INDIAN PARADE HE DIDN'T  REALIZE HIS MICROPHONE HAD  BEEN SET TO JAMAICAN ACCENT AUTO TUNE. NOW YOU MAY SAY ALL RIGHT,  FINE WHAT ABOUT THAT TEXT  MESSAGE HE SENT TO HIS  NON WIFE LADY WHERE HE SAID HE WANTED TO QUOTE-- [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)  MAYBE SHE HAD SOMETHING ON  HER FACE AND HE TRIED TO GET  HER ATTENTION BY GOING LIKE, YOU KNOW--   (LAUGHTER)  BUT SHE WASN'T, YOU KNOW,  AND THEN HE THOUGHT OH, I  KNOW WHAT COULD GET THAT  OFF. (LAUGHTER)  AN MAYBE INSTEAD OF SENDING  A PICTURE HE MEANT TO SEND A  PICTURE OF-- BUT HIS CAMERA PHONE AUTO CORRECTED. NAH, HE'S JUST A GUY WITH  SELF-CONTROL ISSUES NEVER  SHOULD HAVE RUN FOR MAYOR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
