THERE'S ALWAYS THAT FEAR OF LIKE TIPPING RIGHT OVER.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? WE NEARLY KILLED JIMMY CARTER.
OH JESUS, REALLY?
Jon: A FEW YEARS BACK. LET ME SHOW, OH, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE IT REALLY. YOU SEE THIS LITTLE,  THIS LITTLE PART RIGHT HERE, THIS LITTLE EDGE PART? SO, THAT WASN'T HERE AT ALL. AND JIMMY CARTER SAT DOWN...
OH GOD.
Jon: AND KICKED BACK, AND THIS THING WENT WINK AND TOOK HIM TO THE EDGE OF CONCUSSION TOWN. [LAUGHTER] ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
I HAD A JIMMY CARTER WIND-UP PEANUT AS A CHILD.
Jon: DID YOU REALLY?
YEAH. THOSE WERE THE COOL TOYS I PLAYED WITH. I LOVED IT.  IT HAD JIMMY CARTER'S, WE WENT TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND I GOT A PEANUT WITH JIMMY CARTER'S FACE ON IT AND TWO LITTLE FEET. AND WHEN YOU WOUND IT UP, IT WENT. I STILL HAVE IT SOMEWHERE. I WAS LIKE, THAT'S AWESOME.
Jon: YOU, YOU, YOU WORKED WITH YOUR HUSBAND ON THIS?
I DID.
Jon: YOU WROTE IT WITH HIM?
I DID.
Jon: HE DIRECTED IT.
I KNOW.
Jon: DO YOU STILL LIKE EACH OTHER?
NO. NO.
Jon: I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN IN MONTHS, AND BY "MONTHS," I MEAN A YEAR AND A HALF. NO, NO IT WAS, I KNOW EVERYBODY IS LIKE, THAT SEEMS LIKE A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. I LOVED IT.
Jon: YEAH.
HE'S THE CALMEST, NICEST GUY, AND HE'S A REAL SMARTY AND HE'S REALLY FUNNY. THAT'S KIND OF HOW HE DIRECTED.
Jon: THAT'S NICE.
YEAH.
Jon: DID YOU EVER SEE, WAS THERE EVER A SIDE, YOU KNOW, IN A SCENE LIKE IT WASN'T GOING SO AND LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN HE TURNED RED AND FIRED A CHILD? LIKE WAS THERE ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WHERE HE WAS LIKE, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE?
ONLY ON THE DAY HE WORE JODHPURS AND LIKE YELLED AT ME THROUGH A WAS LIKE, "DO IT AGAIN, McCARTHY. BOO!" LOTS OF THAT. I KIND OF WANTED ONE DAY. I WAS LIKE, AREN'T YOU GOING TO GO CRAZY AT LEAST ONCE?
Jon: YOU'VE GOT TO. HAVE YOU EVER WORKED WITH A DIRECTOR LIKE THAT WAS LIKE JUST EDGY AND MADE IT A LITTLE BIT TOUGH? AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THEIR NAMES, ALTHOUGH IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO.
OH, I'LL NAME NAMES. NO, I DID ONE COMMERCIAL, AND THE PERSON NEVER CAME DOWN. IT WAS A GUY. I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS...
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE HE NEVER CAME DOWN TO SAY, LIKE, HEY, THANKS FOR SHOWING UP. NOTHING. HE STAYED WAY UP IN LIKE A GLASS BOOTH SOMEWHERE. AND HE JUST YELLED AT US THROUGH A SPEAKER ALL DAY. IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING. AND, AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. AND I WAS LIKE,  COULD YOU IMAGINE IF HE JUST DID THAT ALL DAY?
Jon: AND HE DID IT ALL DAY.
AND THAT'S WHEN THE AD WAS LIKE LET'S NOT... LET'S NOT... THAT'S PROBABLY NOT FUNNY. I WAS LIKE, AND IT WAS ALL LIKE I WAS JUST MOVING BOXES. IT WAS LIKE A FACTORY FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
SO HE'S LIKE, A LITTLE MORE ENERGY. WELL, DON'T GO CRAZY. SO I WAS LIKE...
Jon: FIND YOUR CENTER.
I KNOW. SO HOWEVER I WAS MOVING BOXES SUCKED APPARENTLY BECAUSE I WAS EITHER TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW AND THERE WERE THREE OF US AND NOBODY KNEW WHO HE WAS YELLING AT.
Jon: I WENT ON A COMMERCIAL AUDITION YEARS AGO. IT WAS LIKE WHEN YOU WOULD GO IN FOR LIKE CHILIS AND THEY'RE LIKE IT'S YOU AND THREE PEOPLE YOU NEVER MET BEFORE LIKE "YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS AND YOU'RE HAVING NACHO PARTY AND THESE NAPKINS ARE NACHOS. AND YOU'RE LIKE "GO." NUMBER THREE, HAVE FUN.
IT'S SO...NUMBER THREE, YOU'RE UPSETTING US.
Jon: RIGHT. THIS IS THE MOST FUN I'VE EVER HAD.
I WENT IN. THERE WAS, THERE'S ALWAYS, GOD BLESS, THERE'S ALWAYS ONE PERSON, THAT'S LIKE A BUNCH OF NICE PEOPLE, EVERYONE IS JUST TRYING TO GET A JOB, AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS ONE CRAZY, WHICH IS PROBABLY IN ANY GROUP. BUT THERE WAS A GIRL THAT CAME STORMING IN THE ROOM ONCE. THERE WERE LIKE 15 OF US, AND THEN 15 KIDS, AND THEN LITERALLY THERE WERE LIKE WEIRD DOLLS, IT WAS A HUGE AREA WHERE THERE WERE TEN DIFFERENT COMMERCIALS. AND I KNEW, IT WAS LIKE I NEVER GOT HIRED FOR THOSE BECAUSE THEY HATED ME. AND THIS GIRL CAME STORMING IN AND LIKE WITH ALL THE ENERGY OF LIKE A JUST A TRUE MAYBE UNBALANCED GAL IN HER 20S.
Jon: A DIVA.
TRYING TO MAKE, SHE LITERALLY CAME UP TO ME. SHE WAS LIKE "ALRIGHT" AND WENT IN FOR LIKE SOME KIND OF CLAPPING THING. BEFORE, BEFORE LIKE COOL HANDSHAKES WERE IN. AND THEN LIKE IMMEDIATELY SAT DOWN AND WAS LIKE TRYING TO BE IN ON A JOKE THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS IN. AND THEN WHEN WE WENT IN, I PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE TELLING THIS STORY. I'M LITERALLY PSYCHO-ANALYZING THIS GIRL. IT'S TERRIBLE.
Jon: TELL IT! TELL IT!
WE WENT IN AND SHE GOES, YOU GUYS ARE MY FRIENDS, SO JUST LET ME SET IT UP. WE'RE COOL. AND I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW YOU. AND SHE'S LIKE, JUST LET ME SET IT UP. WE GO WAY BACK. AND SHE CAME IN, SHE'S LIKE HEY YOU GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LIKE THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T KNOW HER. THEY'RE LIKE, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO? AND SHE'S LIKE, OH YOU KNOW, JUST GOT OVER AN ABORTION, DOING COOL. HANGING COOL.
Jon: OH, MY GOD.
HANGING COOL, DOING WHAT I DO, AUDITIONING A LOT. LIKE IT WAS LIKE ABORTION, HANGING COOL, GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT MY ACTING. AND I LITERALLY WAS JUST LIKE... LIKE I KNOW I WENT REAL WEIRD. I THINK I STARTED JUST BEING LIKE, I CAN TAKE MYSELF OUT OF THE ROOM. AND SHE'S LIKE KIND OF HANGING ON ME LIKE WE'RE BUDS. I WAS LIKE, OH, I'M GETTING SO NAUSEOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THERE'S NO ANSWER TO THAT.
Jon: NO.
AND THEN STRANGELY WE DID NOT GET THAT JOB.
Jon: REALLY? WHEN IS "TAMMY"... "TAMMY" IS COMING OUT ON THE SECOND.
THE SECOND.
Jon: THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE BLOCKBUSTER. AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHY.
WHY?
Jon: PEOPLE LOVE MELISSA McCARTHY.
WELL YOU.
