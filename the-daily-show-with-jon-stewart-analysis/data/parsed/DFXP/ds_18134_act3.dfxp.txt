[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SERVES AS  COHOST AND MENTOR ON LIFETIME'S  PROJECT RUNWAY.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE UP  THERE ALONE. YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP THERE  TOGETHER. YOU'RE A TEAM. THE JUDGES AREN'T GOING TO  SINGLE YOU OUT AND SAY, "SANDRA,  YOU DID X, Y AND Z." SUE AND I DID THIS TOGETHER. YOU'RE BOTH RESPONSIBLE. GO BACK TO WORK. HI, KATE. HI, HELEN.
RIGHT NOW WE'RE CREATING A  REALLY STRUCTURED BOOEDICE WHICH  WILL FUNCTION LIKE THIS. THERE WILL BE A HIGH SCULPTED  SOLDIER.
THIS CAPTURES YOUR EYE. YOU DO YOU REALLY NEED THE EYE  TO GO UP HERE TOO.
John: HE'S THE BEST. PLEASE WE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  TIM GUNN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MR. GUNN.
I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH  YOU.
John: I AM THRILLED TO BE  HERE WITH YOU. I LOVE PROJECT RUNWAY.
I LOVE YOUR WORK ON THE DAILY  SHOW. SO WE'RE EVEN.
John: THERE'S NO OTHER WORK. SO I'M DONE ON THAT. I WATCH NEWS ALL THE TIME, SPORT  ALL THE TIME AND PROJECT RUNWAY. IN THE CONVENIENT DIAGRAM OF  THOSE THREE THINGS I THINK IT'S  JUST ME IN THE MIDDLE.
I THINK YOU MAY BE CORRECT. John: AT FIRST AS A GAY MAN,  CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CATHOLIC  CHURCH'S CHANGE OF TONE. YOU MUST BE ALMOST PLEASED BY  THAT NEWS.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU AT LEAST  WATCHING YOUR PIECE ON THIS  EXPLAIND THE ENTIRE THING TO ME BECAUSE I WAS COMPLETELY  MYSTIFIED BY IT.
John: THE TONE HAS CHANGED. SOME HATEFUL MESSAGE BUT MUCH  FRIENDLIER TONE OF VOICE.
THAT'S TO SEDUCE YOU IN A  LITTLE CLOSER AND THEN GIVE YOU  A BIG BITCH SLAP.
John: OVER THE YEARS THE  CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS BEEN GOOD  WITH THE BITCH SLAP.
IT'S THE BEST. John: JUST ASK THE SPANISH. I WAS READING THAT YOU RECENTLY  ENDORSED CHRISTINE QUINN HERE  FOR MAYOR IN NEW YORK.
YES. John: ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE  YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANTHONY  WEINER A FIFTH CHANCE? ARE YOU SURE, TIM?
I THINK ANTHONY WEINER'S NAME  IS A METAPHOR FOR HOW HE IS AND  WILL BEHAVE AS A MAYOR IF WE'RE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO ELECT HIM. IT'S A LITTLE FRIGHTENING.
John: IT WILL BE AMAZING BUT  I DON'T THINK NEW YORKERS ARE  GOING TO DO THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE IF MY HEART OF  HEARTS.
I'M GOING TO BE GOING AROUND  ON SEPTEMBER 10 WHICH IS THE DAY  OF THE PRIMARY MAKING CERTAIN THAT THEY'RE WELL INFORMED ABOUT  THEIR DECISION-MAKING.
John: PROJECT RUNWAY IS BACK  FOR YOUR 134th SEASON.
I HOPE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE  THAT.
John: THIS TIME YOU HAVE THE  ABILITY TO OVERRULE A JUDGE'S  DECISION.
I DO. John: YOU ARE GOD. THANK YOU. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THOUGH WHAT  HAPPENED WAS THAT IN SEASON 11,  I INTERVENED WITH THE JUDGING PROCESS NEAR THE VERY END OF THE  SEASON BECAUSE AN INCREDIBLE  DESIGNER WAS BEING ELIMINATED. I WENT STORMING DOWN TO THE  JUDGE'S CIRCLE. I SAID, "YOU CANNOT DO THIS. THIS IS A GIFTED INDIVIDUAL AND  SHE MUST REMAIN HERE."  I ENDED UP SAVING HER. WE HAD NO ONE ELIMINATED THAT  CHALLENGE. SHE WON THE ENTIRE SEASON.
John: EXACTLY. BECAUSE YOU WERE RIGHT.
I HOPE SO. THANK YOU.
John: YOU WERE OBJECTIVELY  RIGHT.   ( APPLAUSE )   ONE OF THE THINGS... I SHOUTED  AT MY OWN TV. WHENEVER YOU DO CONSULTATION  WITH ONE OF THEM AND THEY SAY  I'M NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO TIM. I PHYSICALLY SHUT OUTLOUD, HOW  CAN YOU IGNORE TIM? LISTEN TO HIM.
JOHN, I'M NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. I'M NOT. I GIVE THE DESIGNERS THE BENEFIT  OF MY EXPERIENCE AND MY  KNOWLEDGE AND I SAY TO THEM YOU HAVE TO OWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR  YOUR OWN DECISION-MAKING BECAUSE  YOU'RE THE ONE ON THE RUNWAY IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES. I'M NOT. THE LAST THING I WANT YOU TO SAY  IS, GOD DAM IT I LISTENED TO TIM  GUNN. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY  LOOK AT THEIR WORK CRITICALLY  AND OBJECTIVELY WITH ME AND HAVE ENOUGH DISTANCE TO MAKE SOME  VIABLE, HOPEFULLY, EXCELLENT  DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
John: THAT'S WHAT I LOVE  ABOUT THE SHOW BECAUSE SO MUCH  TV IS CYNICAL NOW. YOU REALLY ADVOCATE FOR THOSE  DESIGNERS. THERE'S AN ENTHUSIASM TO THE  SHOW, A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. YOU MUST FIND THESE PEOPLE  SOMEWHERE. YOU MUST GET HUMAN CAR CRASHES  TURNING UP.
OH, WE DO. John: SAYING LOOK AT THE  DRESS I'VE MADE. YOU DON'T SHOW THAT BECAUSE IT'S  A CELEBRATION OF GENUINE TALENT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M VERY, VERY PROUD OF THE SHOW  AND ALSO FOR WHAT IT'S DONE FOR  AMERICAN FASHION
John: AND YOU GOT NOMINATED  FOR AN EMMY.
YES, THANK YOU. John: YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY  COHOST.
I AM INDEED. I HAVE TO SAY HOW GENEROUS IS IT  OF HER TO SHARE THAT SPOTLIGHT  WITH ME.
John: BE CAREFUL OF THAT  BECAUSE SHE'S GERMAN. THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO SHARE. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SHARE  CZECHOSLOVAKIA. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY.
THE TONE HAS CHANGED. John: I HAVE ONE PITCH FOR  PROJECT RUNWAY. HOW ABOUT A CHALLENGE ON AN  ACTUAL RUNWAY WITH PLANES TAKING  OFF AND LANDING AS THEY COMMENT. YOU COULD SEE THE MATERIAL MOVE. THAT'S OFTEN IMPORTANT. THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED. YOU WANT TO SEE THE FABRIC MOVE.
YOU KNOW, WE ALMOST DID THAT  WITH OUR FIRST CHALLENGE OF THE  SEASON. WE WENT TO AN AIRPORT AND HAD  PARACHUTERS. WE WERE CLOSE.
John: I LOVE THE SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH  John: YOU'RE FANTASTIC IN IT. TIM GUNN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THE MAGNIFICENT TIM GUNN.
