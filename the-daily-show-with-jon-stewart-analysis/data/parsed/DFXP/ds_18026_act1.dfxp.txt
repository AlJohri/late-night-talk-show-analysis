FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  A ARE, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL     ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE  ""DAILY SHOW"."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. I HAVE A GOOD DIVEST TONIGHT. THE MOST DELIGHTFUL LAUGH IN  TELEVISION TO MY MIND, JUDGE  ANDREW NAPOLITANO WILL BE JOINING US RIGHT OVER HERE. FIRST, I WANT TO LET YOU PEOPLE  KNOW I AM A JEW WHO IS IN TO  POLITICS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). BEEN DOING THE SHOW 15 YEARS  NOW.   (  LAUGHTER  )   SPEAKING OF WHICH, OOH, I THINK  WE HAVE A NEW MIDDLE EAST WAR  BREWING OUT THERE. THAT'S LATE-BREAKING NEWS. WE'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT  WHEN WE GET BACK. WHAT'S BETTER THAN A MIDDLE EAST  WAR. LET'S BEGIN ONE MORE FROM THE  "WHERE ARE THEY NOW?."  YOU MAY REMEMBER MITT ROMNEY MADE A RATHER INFAMOUS STATEMENT  THAT 47% OF THE COUNTRY WOULD  NOT VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY SAW HIMSELF AS VICTIMS,  ENTITLED-- HOUSING, HEALTH CARE,  FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AS IT TURNS OUT, MUCH TO HIS  DISAPPOINTMENT, BARACK OBAMA WAS  ABLE TO PICK UP FOUR MORE PERCENT OF REAL AMERICA GIVING  HIM THE VICTORY. OF COURSE ROMNEY WALKED BACK HIS  47% STATEMENT.
IN THIS CASE I SAID SOMETHING  THAT WAS JUST COMPLETELY WRONG,  AND I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT MY LIFE HAS SHOWN  THAT I CARE ABOUT 100%, AND--  AND THAT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
Jon:  I BELIEVE HIM.   ( LAUGHTER )   THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A MAN  STANDING IN FRONT OF A PERFECTLY  PRESSED FLAG AND THE WORLD'S CLEANEST INDOOR TRACTOR THAT  SAYS, "I'M THE REAL DEAL."  LAUGHED LAUGH    ( LAUGHTER ) YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN  THIS MAN, SO UNFAIRLY CHARACTER  TURD, BY HIS OWN WORDS, AS AN OUT-OF-TOUCH PLUTOCRAT YESTERDAY  BLAMED HIS CAMPAIGN LOSS ON  LEACHES.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN  DID WAS FOCUS ON CERTAIN MEMBERS  OF HIS BASE COALITION, GIVE THEM EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL GIFTS  FROM THE GOVERNMENT, AND THEN  WORK VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO TURN THEM OUT TO VOTE.   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  HOW ON EARTH DID  MITT ROMNEY FIND OUT ABOUT THE  EXTRAORDINARY BAG OF GIFTS?   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THAT WE GOT. AND THIS. OH, WHAT DID OBAMA GIVE US? OH, A BAG OF WEED. THAT WAS NICE.  OH, FOOD STAMP COZY. CONTRACEPTION VARIETY PACK!   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   VERY THOUGHTFUL. PINATA FILLED WITH GREEN CARDS! AND, OF COURSE, FOR THE HIPSTER  VOTERS, A CERTIFICATE WHERE LENA  DUNHAM WILL CHASTISE YOU WHILE YOU MASTER BAIT. I'M KIDDING! THESE ARE THE GIFTS MITT ROMNEY  IS TALKING ABOUT.
THE PRESIDENT WOOED HISPANIC  VOTERS ARE FREE HEALTH CARE AND  AMNESTY FOR CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL  IMMIGRANTS.
WITH REGARDS TO THE YOUNG  PEOPLE, FOR INSTANCE, ROMNEY  SAID, A FORGIVENESS OF COLLEGE LOAN INTEREST WAS A BIG GIFT.
ANYONE 26 YEARS OF AGE OR  YOUNGER WAS NOW GOING TO BE PART  OF THEIR PARENTS' PLAN.
FREE CONTRACEPTIVES WERE VERY  BIG WITH YOUNG COLLEGE-AGED  WOMEN.
Jon:  YEAH, THEY LOVED  ( BLEEP ). WHILE MITT ROMNEY BLAMED HIS  LOSS ON OBAMA VOTERS'  BRIBABILITY.
IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL  AMERICA ANYMORE.
TRADITIONAL AMERICA AS WE  KNEW IT IS GONE.
WARD, JUNE, WALLY, AND THE  BEAV, OUT OF HERE.
YEAH, PRET MUCH.   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YES. YES, BILL.  OBAMA'S REELECTION MARKED THE  MOMENT THAT TRADITIONAL AMERICA  ENDED. THE MOMENT WHEN THE FAMILY FROM  THE 1950s SITCOM "LEAVE IT TO  BEAVER," CEASED TO BE REAL. YES, IT WAS A MOMENT WHEN--    ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   TRADITIONAL AMERICA-- OBAMA'S REELECTION WAS THE MOMENT WHEN  TRADITIONAL MREALIZED EVEN THEIR  RICH WIVES COULDN'T SAVE THEM FROM BEING REPLACED. BILL O'REILLY, WHAT ARE YOU  TALKING ABOUT!
THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHANGING   CHANGING. THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IS NOW  THE MINORITY.
Jon:  YES, AS AMERICAN  DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN  CHANGING. AND THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT ALWAYS  GIVING WAY TO-- AND PRESENTING--  A NEW ESTABLISHMENT, MR. O'REILLY AND MR. GOLDBERG.   ( LAUGHTER )   OR PERHAPS MR. O'REILLY IS  FORGETTING THE-- HOLD ON--  19th CENTURY.   (  LAUGHTER  )   WHEN PEOPLE WITH NAMES LIKE  O'REILLY WERE DESCRIBED IN THE  "CHRISTIAN EXAMINER" NEWSPAPER WITH PHRASE LIKE, "THE ILL-CLAD  IRISH MAN IS REPULSIVE TO OUR  HABITS AND TASTES." BY THE WAY, THE "CHRISTIAN  EXAMINER" NEWSPAPER AT THAT TIME  CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MORE PROGRESSIVE NEWSPAPERS BY  ACKNOWLEDGING THE IRISH TO BE  HUMAN.   (  LAUGHTER  )   HERE'S "HARPER'S WEEKLY" ON THE  19th CENTURY THREAT TO  TRADITIONAL WHITE MESH. WE GAVE THEM LAND FWAGES FAR  BETTER THAN THEY COULD OBTAIN AT  HOME AND COME TO US STEEPED IN IGNORANCE AND SUPERISTITION. NEARLY 75% OF OUR CRIMINALS AND  PAUPERS ARE IRISH."  SEE, BILL, YOU GUYS TURNED MOST OF THAT AROUND.   ( LAUGHTER )     ( APPLAUSE )   AS FOR YOUR FRIEND BERNIE, I DID  SEARCH MIGHT BE ROFEAR, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS AND COULD  NOT FIND ANY INSTANCES AT ANY  POINT IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHERE TRADITIONAL AMERICANS DIDN'T  LIKE JEWS. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. I TRIED. TURNS OUT, APPARENTLY, JEWS HAVE  ALWAYS BEEN IN AMERICA AND  ALWAYS BEEN LOVED AND ACCEPTED.   ( LAUGHTER )   WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR  CATHOLICISM.
ONLY ABOUT 30% OF  AMERICANICALS NOW ATTEND WEEKLY  MASS. YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF  CREEPING SECULARISM ON THE  RELIGIOUS VOTE. ON PAPER, THE STATS LOOK  HOPELESS FOR TRADITIONAL  AMERICANS.
Jon:  RIGHT, AS STATS  ABOUT CREEPING CATHOLICISM IN  THE 1840s LOOKED TO THE AMERICAN SOCIETY TO PROMOTE THE  PRINCIPLES OF THE PROTESTANT  REFORMATION OR A.S.P.P.P.R. THEY HADN'T CRACKED THE ACRONYM  THING THEN. THEY FELT THE EXTENSION OF  CATHOLICISM ENDANGERED AMERICAN  FREEDOM AND BACK IN THE "LEAVE IT TO BEAVER" DAYS THEY WOULDN'T  EVEN ELECT A CATHOLIC PRESIDENT  UNTIL J.F.K. GAVE A SPEECH ENSURING PROTESTANT CLERGY HE  WOULDN'T TAKE ORDERS FROM THE  POPE. HE WOULD TAKE ORDERS FROM  SOMETHING THAT STARTS WITH A "P"  AND RESEMBLES A WRINKLED OLD MAN WEARING A HAT.   (  LAUGHTER  )     ( APPLAUSE )   "ASK NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR  YOUR COUNTRY. LET'S JUST FIND SOME CHICKS."  HOW DO YOU THINK TRADITIONAL  AMERICANS WOULD HAVE REACTED TO A MORMON CANDIDATE FOR  PRESIDENT? SEEING AS IN 1857, PRESIDENT  BUCHANAN SENT THE ARMY TO UTAH  TO FIGHT THEM. BERNIE, BERNIE, BILL, FOX, YOU  DON'T NEED TO WORRY SO MUCH. ... WHAT YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING  IS THE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF  AMERICA'S GREATEST TRADITION-- A FEVERED RULING CLASS LAMENTING  THE RISE OF A NEW ET CETERA  NICKLY DIVERSE NEW CLASS ONE THAT WILL DESTROY ALL THAT IS  VIRTUOUS AND GOOD AND BRING THE  AMERICAN EXPERIMENT CRASHING TO THE GROUND. EXCEPT YOU'RE FORGETTING ONE  THING-- THAT IS THE AMERICAN  EXPERIMENT. AP ETHNIC GROUP ARRIVING ON  AMERICA'S SHORES, TO BE REVILED,  LIVING IN SCALLOR, OR IF THEY'RE LUCKY, SCALLOR HEIGHTS.   (  LAUGHTER  )   WORKING HARD TO GIVE THEIR  CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN THE  OPPORTUNITY TO ( BLEEP ) ON THE NEXT GROUP LANDING ON OUR  SHORES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SO ENOUGH.  ENOUGH! RELAX! ENOUGH WITH THE LAMENTATIONS. UNLESS YOUR REAL NAME IS SITTING  BILL, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO  COMPLAIN ABOUT.   ( LAUGHTER )   WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
