FEBRUARY 13, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. HEY, WE'RE BACK! WE'RE BACK. THIS... RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS NOT A RERUN-- UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU'RE WATCHING THIS EPISODE FIVE WEEKS FROM NOW WHEN WE GET ANOTHER UNREASONABLY UNDESERVED VACATION. (LAUGHTER) SO TONIGHT WE HAVE A VERY COOL GUEST, A FORMER SPECIAL AGENT  WHO SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS BATTLING AL QAEDA AS A COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIVE. IT'S A TERRIFIC TIME FOR YOU TO LOOK BACK ON THE LAST DECADE OF YOUR LIFE AND REALLY... (LAUGHTER) REASSESS. I THINK REASSESS. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DWELL ON THE WEEKEND SAD NEWS, WE CAN'T PROCESS THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING? NEITHER COULD CNN. (LAUGHTER)ï¿½ï¿½ HERE THEY ARE BREAKING THE SAD NEWS ONE PERSON AT A TIME.
NEWS JUST BROKE, IT'S NOT SO GOOD NEWS. WHITNEY HOUSTON HAS DIED.
OH, MY GOD.
WHITNEY HOUSTON PASSED AWAY.
SHE DID? WHAT
WHAT?
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
NOPE, JUST HAPPENED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DEAL WITH IT, WHATEVER. YOU CAN'T JUST GO OUT IN THE STREETS WITH A CAMERA CREW SURPRISING PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW  SOMEBODY FAMOUS HAS DIED. YOU CAN'T... (LAUGHTER) ISN'T THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE TO INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT  THESE DEATHS YOUR NETWORK? I THOUGHT... (LAUGHTER) THE WHOLE POINT OF BROADCASTING YOUR SIGNAL, S THAT YOU DON'T  HAVE TO GO WITH THE NEWS TOWN CRIER STYLE DOOR TO DOOR, YOU'RE GIVING THE NEWS OF THIS DEATH  THE SAME WAY IN TIMES SQUARE THEY PASS OUT NAIL SALON COUPONS. THAT'S NOT... (LAUGHTER) THAT'S NOT... THAT'S NOT RIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT IS THE POINT? IS THE POINT OF CNN NOW TO JUST SHOW PEOPLE GOING "WHAT?"ï¿½r  BECAUSE THAT'S THE POINT OF CANDID CAMERA. WE'VE PLACED A NEWS REPORTER INSIDE A MAILBOX WITH THE NEWS A CELEBRITY THEY LOVE IS DYING. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY TRY TO MAIL A LETTER. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY, THE WHITNEY HOUSTON COVERAGE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE  ONLY NEWS I SAW OVER THE BREAK. I TRIED TO KEEP AWAY FROM THE POLITICS NEWS. BESIDES, NOTHING THAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING BUT ANOTHER STRING OF PRIMARY VICTORIES FOR OLD  FRONT-RUNNER MITTINGTON ROMNEY.
HUGE NIGHT FOR RICK SANTORUM.
A CLEAN SWEEP ACROSS THE BOARD FOR RICK SANTORUM.
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TOOK HOME A HUGE WIN IN ALL THREE STATE, MISSOURI, MINNESOTA, AND COLORADO.
Jon: WHAT THE HELL? (LAUGHTER) AMERICA, I LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE WEEK. (LAUGHTER) ONE WEEK! I EXPECT YOU TOW GO A LITTLE CRAZY, MAYBE HAVE A PARTY, INVITE MEXICO OVER, DRAW A PENIS ON CANADA'S HEAD WHILE IT'S SLEEPING. (LAUGHTER) MAYBE GRAB A CAMERA CREW, WALK AROUND INFORMING INDIVIDUALS SOMEONE THEY LOVE DIED. BUT MAKING THIS GUY THE FRONT-RUNNER? OH, MAN! NOW WE'RE GOING TO START FIGHTING ABOUT RELIGION AND PUBLIC POLICY AGAIN, AREN'T WE? ALL RIGHT.
LAST MONTH, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID THE NEW HEALTH CARE LAW RISHZ RELIGIOUS  HOSPITALS, COLLEGES, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS TO INCLUDE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE IN THEIR  INSURANCE PLANS. THAT SET OFF A FIRESTORM AMONG MANY CATHOLICS.
Jon: YES, WE ARE MEN OF GOD! THAT MONEY MUST NOT BE USED FOR CONTRACEPTION. THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SET ASIDE FOR OUT OF COURT ALTAR BOY SETTLEMENTS AND, OF COURSE, SOME  PRIEST RELOCATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RESPECT OUR AUTHORITY! (APPLAUSE) SERIOUSLY, A FIRESTORM AMONG MANY CATHOLICS OR THE OLD DUDES WHO RUN IT?
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS SHREDING THE FIRST AMENDMENT, STEPPING ON RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.
Jon: OLD DUDES WHO RUN IT. (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THE BIRTH CONTROL HEALTH PLAN REQUIREMENT ACTUALLY EXEMPTED... I TOLD YOU. LISTEN... (APPLAUSE) FIRST DAY BACK, WE COULD HAVE FOUND THIS (BLEEP) AND WE DID NOT. WE SPENT A GOOD THREE HOURS ON THIS. THE BIRTH CONTROL HEALTH PLAN REQUIREMENT DID EXEMPT CHURCHES. BUT NOT CHURCH AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS LIKE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AND CHARITIES. SO, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HOW WILL YOU KEEP THE CATHOLIC CHURCH FROM SULLYING ITSELF BY HAVING  TO PAY FOR ONE OF ITS HOSPITALS' JEWISH LADY DOCTOR'S... YOU KNOW MISCHEF.
IF A WOMAN'S EMPLOYER IS A CHARITY OR HOSPITAL THAT HAS A  RELIGIOUS OBJECTION TO PROVIDING CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES AS PART OF THEIR HEALTH PLAN, THE  INSURANCE COMPANY-- NOT THE HOSPITAL, NOT THE CHARITY-- WILL BE REQUIRED TO REACH OUT AND  OFFER THE WOMAN CONTRACEPTIVE CAREFREE OF CHARGE. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS WON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THESE SERVICES AND NO RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION  WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES DIRECTLY.
OH. WELL, I GUESS WE'RE DONE HERE. (LAUGHTER) COMPROMISE MADE, EVERYBODY HAPPY.
THIS IS SIMPLY SOMEONE TRYING TO IMPOSE THEIR VALUES ON SOMEBODY ELSE WITH THE ARM OF  THE GOVERNMENT.
AND I FRANKLY DON'T CARE WHAT DEAL HE TRIES TO CUT, THIS IS A  MAN WHO IS DEEPLY COMMITTED. IF HE WINS REELECTION, HE WILL WAGE WAR ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE MORNING AFTER HE'S REELECTED.
Jon: OH, WOW. (BOOS) IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME SORT OF PILL YOU COULD TAKE TO PREVENT... (LAUGHTER) ... OBAMA'S REELECTION THE MORNING AFTER. A PLAN "B" FOR HIS REELECTION, IF YOU WILL. (LAUGHTER) BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT APPEARS THAT RICK SANTORUM... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK WE'RE FINDING THE AUDIENCE'S G-SPOT. (LAUGHTER) IT APPEARS... NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW BECAUSE I WOULDN'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) IT APPEARS, THOUGH, THAT RICK SANTORUM EARLIER IN THAT CLIP  TAKES ISSUE WITH THE PRESIDENT IMPOSING HIS VALUES ON OTHER AMERICANS WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S ARM. WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS WHOSE ARM IT IS YOU USE TO IMPOSE YOUR VALUES.
AS LONG AS ABORTION IS LEGAL-- AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT-- LEGAL IN  THIS COUNTRY, WE WILL NEVER HAVE REST BECAUSE THAT LAW DOES NOT COMPORT WITH GOD'S LAW.
I AM FOR A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMOUNT AND REINSTATING "DON'T  ASK, DON'T TELL." RIGHTS COME TO US FROM GOD AND WHEN GOD GIVES US RIGHT HE IS  DOESN'T SAY HERE ARE YOUR RIGHTS, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO WITH THEM. THAT, IN FACT, HE HAS LAWS THAT WE MUST ABIDE BY.
Jon: GOT IT. SO IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD ALL BE FREE TO LIVE BY  CHRISTIAN LAW.ï¿½i I THINK THAT... I'VE GOT TO THE SAY, THAT'S THE KIND OF RIGID  THINKING THAT GOT SANTORUM DRUMMED OUT OF THE SENATE. NOBODY IN THE COOLING SAUCER OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO TAKE THAT DEBATE NOW.
SENATOR BLUNT FROM MISSOURI, ONE OF YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, HE WANTS AN AMENDMENT NOW THAT WOULD ALLOW  ANY GROUP THAT HAD A MORAL OBJECTION TO THIS TO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PUSH THAT IN THE SENATE?
OF COURSE I'D BE LAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. AND INTEND TO SUPPORT IT.
Jon: REALLY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD BE? (BLEEP)ING CHAOS. YOU REALIZE THAT, RIGHT? THAT'S CHAOS. ALL RIGHT, I'M A CHRISTIAN SCIENTIST, I DON'T HAVE TO  PROVIDE ANY HEALTH CARE, I DON'T BELIEVE IT IN. IT'S UP TO YOUR BOSS. I WORK FOR THE HEAD FOOTBALL COACH OF MY HIGH SCHOOL, I GOT MY HEALTH CARE PLAN AND IT SAYS  "WALK IT OFF, YOU PUSS ZI." (LAUGHTER) YOU CAN'T DECIDE ON YOUR OWN. WE'RE EITHER IN A SOCIETY OR NOT A SOCIETY. I'M AN EMPLOYER! AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN THE HEALING POWER OF COMEDY. (LAUGHTER) I ALONG WITH THE READER'S DIGEST MAGAZINE BELIEVE LAUGHTER IS THE  BEST MEDICINE AND YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY ONE OF MY WRITERS HAS BEEN FIGHTING THE FLU FOR SEVERAL WEEKS NOW. HEY, ELLIOTT, COME ON OUT HERE. THIS IS ONE OF OUR WRITERS, ELLIOTT.
THIS IS NOT ANOTHER TREATMENT IS IT?
Jon: YEAH. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHY CAN'T YOU GIVE ME ZITHROMAX?
Jon: I DON'T BELIEVE IN ZITHROMAX, THAT'S WHY. (LAUGHTER) SO I GUESS FOR REPUBLICANS LIBERTY MEANS LIBERTY FOR EMPLOYERS. EMPLOYEES CAN GO (BLEE
