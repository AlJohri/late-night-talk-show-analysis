WELCOME BACK. THE IOWA STRAW POLL ISN'T THE ONLY POLL TO REVEAL SURPRISING RESULTS. CONGRESS WAS THE SUBJECT OF A RECENT POLL. FORTUNATELY NO ONE IN THERE APPEARS READY TO FOLLOW PAWLENTY'S LEAD AND BOW OUT. SAMANTHA BEE HAS MORE.
Reporter: IN THE WAKE OF THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE CONGRESS HAS REACHED A NEW LOW.
CONGRESS'S JOB APPROVAL NUMBER, ACCORDING TO OUR MOST RECENT POLL, IS 14%.
Reporter: 14%. WHO THE (BEEP) ARE THESE PEOPLE? THERE'S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF DENTISTS WHO RECOMMEND SUGARY GUM THAN PEOPLE WHO APPROVE OF CONGRESS. I HIT THE STREETS TO FIND ONE OF THESE ELUSIVE APPROVERS.
THEY'RE SCREWING IT ALL UP.
THEY'RE DOING A TERRIBLE JOB.
I HAVEN'T APPROVED ANYTHING CONGRESS HAS DONE SINCE PERHAPS 1970.
CONGRESS STINKS.
Reporter: STATISTICALLY THERE HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO APPROVED OF CONGRESS.
NO.
NO.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
YES.
Reporter: WHAT?
YES. YES, I DO.
Reporter: AND THERE HE WAS. AN ACTUAL 14%ER. JAMES SCHMOOL.
I TOTALLY APPROVE OF CONGRESS. I HAVE FULL FAITH IN THEM.
Reporter: ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT CONGRESS IS?
YES, I AM.
Reporter: YOU KNOW THAT CONGRESS ISN'T A WATER SKIING SQUIRREL, RIGHT?
LOOK, THIS IS THE 112th CONGRESS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS HAD. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO.
Reporter: OKAY. DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS CONGRESS?
STOP IT.
Reporter: BECAUSE IT'S ITS APPROVAL RATING NEVER GOES DOWN. HE JUST WASN'T GETTING IT. WHO WON THE DEBT CEILING NEGOTIATIONS?
BOTH SIDES WON. AND THE PUBLIC WON TOO.
Reporter: YOU ARE BLOWING MY MIND.
GET USED TO IT.
Reporter: BUT I COULDN'T. I HAD NEVER MET ANYBODY SO EXOTIC. WAS THERE ANYTHING HE DIDN'T LIKE? WHAT DOES THE WORLD LOOK LIKE THROUGH SCHMOOL-COLORED GLASSES? DO YOU LIKE THIS? DO YOU LIKE BEING JAMMED INTO A TAXI CAB STRUCK IN TRAFFIC?
I DON'T MIND IT. I'M USED TO IT.
Reporter: TIME TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH. LET ME GUESS.
I LIKE THIS.
Reporter: YOU LIKE THIS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
Reporter: GREAT.
VERY ENTERTAINING.
Reporter: FROM DONALD TRUMP'S FAVORITE PIZZA....
PRETTY GOOD.
Reporter:... TO NEW YORK'S MANY AMENITIES....
THAT'S FINE. EVERYTHING WAS FINE IN THERE.
Reporter:... AND ITS CULTURAL ICON. REALLY, REALLY? THIS ENTERTAINS YOU?
THIS IS GREAT.
Reporter: THESE WOMEN ARE WASTED. PERHAPS THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AT WORK HERE. SOMETHING THAT WAS WRONG WITH HIS BRAIN PART. WE SUBJECTED HIM TO A BATTERY OF TESTS.
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT ON THIS SCAN. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HE'S BEEN INJURED AT ALL.
Reporter: THERE GOES THAT THEORY.
YOU SEE THIS SMILE? THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.
Reporter: LOOK AT THE SCAN OF YOUR BRAIN.
IT LOOKS LIKE A FACE. YOU HAVE EYES, A NOSE.
Reporter: I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLACE A 14 PERCENTER LIKE JAMES WOULD  EVER FIT IN.
I LIKE TO BE POSITIVE. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I LIVE MY LIFE THAT WAY.
COME ON. THE SUNNYIEST GUY WE KNOW, JAMES.
THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.
