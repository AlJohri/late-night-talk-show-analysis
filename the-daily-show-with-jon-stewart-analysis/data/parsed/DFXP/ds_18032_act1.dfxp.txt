Jon: HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, NEW YORK METS  PITCHER AND RECENT CY YOUNG  RECIPIENT-- CY YOUNG RECIPIENT-- R.A. DICKEY IS GOING TO BE  JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE MAN. MAY BE THE FIRST GUEST IN THE  HISTORY OF THIS PROGRAM TO BE  TRADED WHILE I AM TALKING TO  HIM. (LAUGHTER)  THEY MAY JUST -- THEY MAY COME  IN AND TAKE HIM AWAY. (LAUGHTER)  I THINK I'LL ASK HIM WHAT RACE  HE'D LIKE TO BE. (LAUGHTER)  SOMEBODY ASKED ME THAT BEFORE  THE SHOW STARTED. (LAUGHTER)  WE WERE TALKING BEFORE THE SHOW  STARTED AND EVERYBODY'S GOT A  QUESTION AND "WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT, FROG OR SHARK?"  THAT KIND OF THING. SOMEONE JUST SAID TO ME "WHAT  RACE WOULD YOU BE IF YOU COULD  BE -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY A JEW IS FINE BUT, I MEAN -- IF YOU HAD A  CHANCE, I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU GO  ASIAN JUST FOR A DAY?" (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S FINE. THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE! THEY'RE CASTING A BENTON ADD AND  THEY NEEDED -- IT'S ACTUALLY A  PERFECT WAY TO GET INTO A PROGRAM TONIGHT. WE BEGIN WITH THE ONGOING  NEGOTIATIONS TO SAVE OUR ECONOMY  OR, AS WE'RE CALLING IT,  CLIFFPOCALYPSEMAGEDDONACAUST. (LAUGHTER)  OUR TOTALLY SOLVEABLE BUDGET  PROBLEM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S SCARY. FOUR WEEKS! FOUR WEEKS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN  JUST 20 -- SOME DAYS. (LAUGHTER)  OUR COUNTRY WILL BE HEADING OVER  THE FISCAL CLIFF THAT WE  OURSELVES DUG AND PUT IN OUR  WAY. IT'S THE SET OF AUTOMATIC  SPENDING CUTS AND TAX HIKES THAT  CAN ONLY BE AVERTED IF OUR NATION'S LEADERS ARE ABLE TO  DISPLAY BARE-BONES COMPETENCE  AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL  MATURITY. (LAUGHTER)  SO THE THERE A DEAL.
THERE'S, OF COURSE, NO DEAL.
Jon: OF COURSE! IS THERE THERE A PROSPECT FOR A  DEAL?
THERE'S NOT A PROSPECT FOR A  DEAL.
Jon: OF COURSE! (LAUGHTER)  BUT THE ONGOING TALKS --
THERE AREN'T EVEN VERY MANY  TALKS GOING ON. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DAMN! YOU'RE KIDDING US! GIVE US SOMETHING!
BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE  ARE NUMBERS ON PIECES OF PAPER  FROM BOTH SIDES.
Jon: NUMBERS ON PAPER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE HAVE NUMBERS ON PAPER! FROM BOTH SIDES! (WHISPERING SNVPLD WE'RE ALL  GOING TO BE OKAY. (LAUGHTER)  HOW WERE -- NUMBERS ON PAPER. HOW WERE NEGOTIATIONS BEING  CONDUCTED BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO  PUT NUMBERS ON PAPER? (LAUGHTER)  WERE THEY COMMUNICATEDING BY  PHEROMONES LIKE AUNTS? (LAUGHTER)  VANITY CARDS? IS THAT HOW THIS WAS GOING? WERE THE TWO SIDES JUST SPRAY  PAINTING A SIDE AND HOPING IT  WANDERS PAST THE OTHER SIDE'S OFFICE OR OTHER EQUALLY ABSURD  EXAMPLES? SO TELL US ABOUT THIS PAPER WITH  NUMBERS ON THEM.
$4 TRILLION OF DEFICIT  REDUCTION OVER THE NEXT TEN  YEARS. IT INCLUDES $1.6 TRILLION IN  HIGHER TAXES ON HOUSEHOLDS  MAKING MORE THAN  $250,000 A YEAR. THERE'S ALSO $400 BILLION IN  CUTS TO ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS. THERE'S APLS ALSO SOME FRESH NEW  SPENDING. $50 BILLION NEXT YEAR IN  STIMULUS SPENDING, ALL FOR  INFRASTRUCTURE.
Jon: OOH, GREEN LETTERING. OOH! (LAUGHTER)  JOHNNY LIKE YOU. ALL RIGHT, SO WE GOT A LITTLE  TAX CUT HIKE HERE, A LITTLE  ENTITLEMENT TRIM THERE. BASICALLY TELLING THE GOVERNMENT  IT NEEDS A MIX OF DIET AND  EXERCISE IF I WANT F IT WANTS TO REDUCE ITS CHANCES OF SUCCUMBING  TO HEART DISEASE OR SWOLLEN  PROSTATE -- CHRIST, I JUST TURNED 50. (LAUGHTER)  NO, I'M SORRY. BASICALLY THIS PLAN IS AROUND  SOMEWHAT WHAT OBAMA SAID HE WAS  GOING TO DO ABOUT THE BUDGET WHILE HE WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL. SO I GUESS WE CAN PUT THAT  ANOTHER WAY.
THE PROPOSAL THAT CAME  FORWARD YESTERDAY REALLY IS A  JOKE.
I'M NOT SURPRISED AT MY  COLLEAGUE, SENATOR McCONNELL  LAUGHED AT THAT PROPOSAL.
THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN DOES  NOTHING BUT DAMN TO US BECOMING  GREECE.
DISAPPOINTING.
DISAPPOINTED.
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: REALLY? BECAUSE YOU DON'T SOUND THAT  DISAPPOINTED, QUITE FRANKLY. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT  DISAPPOINTED SOUNDS LIKE?
DISAPPOINTED! (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT GUY'S CLEARLY  DISAPPOINTED. EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN  WHAT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND AT  THE INTERNET A STAGE DIRECTION. HE JUST HAPPENED TO SAY IT  OUTLOUD. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE BUT  WHY NOT SPREAD IT AS FAR AS I  CAN. TO THEIR CREDIT, THE REPUBLICANS  DIDN'T JUST COMPLAIN ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT'S PLAN, THEY PUT FORWARD ON PAPER NUMBERS OF  THEIR OWN.
YOU SEE THE OFFER ON YOUR  GENE, $800 THROUGH TAX REFORM,  $600 BILLION IN HEALTH SAVINGS, $300 BILLION IN MANDATORY  SAVINGS, $300 BILLION FURTHER  DISCRETIONARY SAVINGS THAT NETS TO $2.2 TRILLION IN SAVINGS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SO THE G.O.P. PROPOSAL IS ADDING  UP TOWARDS $1.2 TRILLION IN CUTS  AND A TRILLION IN SAVINGS AND THEY LEAVE THE TAX RATES ALONE  FOR THE TOP 2% AND THEY -- WAIT  A MINUTE. (LAUGHTER)  THE FISCAL CLIFF, THE THING  WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID, AT $1.2  TRILLION IN CUTS, HALF OF THOSE CUTS WERE GOING TO BE TO  DEFENSE. THIS HAS $1.2 TRILLION IN CUTS  BUT THEY'RE JUST SAYING WHY  DON'T WE MAKE THE WHOLE THING CUT TO ENTITLEMENTS AND DOMESTIC  SPENDING AND NOT CUT DEFENSE AT  ALL? BASICALLY THEY'RE TRYING TO  ENTICE THE DEMOCRATS. THEY'RE SAYING I DON'T WANT YOU  TO FALL OFF THIS CLIFF, SO WHY  DON'T YOU VOLUNTARILY JUMP OFF THIS STEEPER CLIFF. (LAUGHTER)  BUT DENT WORRY, YOUR FALL WILL  BE CUSHIONED BY LAVA. (LAUGHTER)  NOW, OBVIOUSLY IT'S A  NEGOTIATION, PEOPLE TAKE A  HARD-LINE POSITION. WITH THE TAX RATE BEING THE  LOWEST IN AMERICA SINCE THE  1950s, MOST LIKELY WE'LL RAISE THE TAX FOR THE UP 2ER% AT SOME  POINT, RIGHT?
RAISING TAX RATES IS  UNACCEPTABLE.
Jon: OKAY. SO WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR IDEA OF  THE A NEGOTIATION?
THE PRESIDENT'S IDEA OF A  NEGOTIATION IS "ROLL OVER AND DO  WHAT I ASK." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AT LEAST ONCE HE HAS YOU  ON YOUR BACK HE ASKS. (LAUGHTER)  I CAN'T WAIT TILL --  (APPLAUSE)  THEY'RE APPLAUDING THE LACK OF  RAPE. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  NOW THEY'RE JUST MIMICKING ME. (LAUGHTER)  (LAUGHTER)  I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE  DEMOCRATS GET AHOLD OF THIS  REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL. THEY ARE GOING TO TEAR IT TO  SHREDS.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY PUT  SOMETHING IN WRITING. THE BAD NEWS IS IT DOESN'T  REALLY GET US IN THE MOVING --  MOVING FORWARD.
THE REPUBLICAN PLAN FAILED  THE VERY FIRST TEST OF FAIRNESS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE SPEAKER'S  PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IS STILL OUT  OF BALANCE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: "OUT OF BALANCE"? WHERE'S YOUR HYSTERICAL  RHETORIC. WHERE'S YOUR "I LAUGHED IN THEIR  (BLEEP)ING FACES!"  WHERE IS YOUR "DISAPPOINTED!" WHERE IS YOUR "THIS PROPOSAL IS  AN INSULT! THIS PROPOSAL WILL DESTROY  AMERICA! THIS PROPOSAL IS LIKE STALIN  (BLEEP) AGO BALD EAGLE!"  (LAUGHTER)  I WILL GUARANTEE YOU STALIN WAS A HARRIER DUDE THAN THAT. GUARANTEE IT. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE IT'S TIME TO STOP THE  BACK-AND-FORTH OF OFFERS. IT'S CLEAR REPUBLICANS AREN'T  GOING TO COME TO THE TABLE WITH  ANYTHING REMOTELY REASONABLE SO I'LL BE THE ONE TO SAY IT: I  KNOW IT WILL BE DISASTROUS, I  KNOW IT WILL DOOM OUR ECONOMY FOR YEARS TO COME, BUT LET'S  JUST GO OVER THE (BLEEP)ING  CLIFF. FINE. LET'S JUST GO. JUST LEAVE THE NEGOTIATING TABLE  AND SEND US OVER THE CLIFF. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? AT LEAST FOR A FEW SECONDS IT  WILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE FLYING. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
