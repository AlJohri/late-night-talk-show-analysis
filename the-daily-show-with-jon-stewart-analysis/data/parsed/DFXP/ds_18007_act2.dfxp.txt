( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME-- WELCOME  BACK TO THE PROGRAM. AS WE SAW EARLIER THIS OUR  PROGRAM, THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE  HAS NOW TIGHTENED CONSIDERABLY. HOW I DO KNOW?
A NEW POLL FROM THE PEW  RESEARCH CENTER--
GALLUP DAILY TRACKING POLL.
RASMUSSEN SWING STATE POLL.
EPIC MRA POLL.
FOX NEWS POLL.
QUINNIPIAC POLL.
MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY POLL,  NBC/"WALL STREET JOURNAL" POLL.
YOU GET A RED CUP FOR THE  REPUBLICANS, A BLUE CUP FOR THE  DEMOCRATS.
Jon:  THE NEW TWO-GIRL,  ONE-CUP POLL. THAT HAS A MARGIN OF ERROR OF--  I HAVE TO SEND THIS POLL TO MY  FRIENDS. SOME NEWS ANCHORS SEEM ALMOST  ADDICTED TO THE POLLING DATA.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT  ONE OF THE FIRST THING I TRY TO  DO IN THE MORNING IS CHECK THE GALLUP TRACKING POLL ON THE  STATE OF RACE FOR PRESIDENT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THAT'S THE SADDEST  THING I'VE EVER HEARD. ( LAUGHTER )  ME, I GET UP, I HAVE HALF A  GRAPE FRUIT, DO A LITTLE  JAZZER-SCISE. THEN I CHECK THE GALLUP TRACKING  POLL. OF COURSE, THERE'S JUST ONE  SMALL PROBLEM WITH ALL THIS DATA  COMING IN. IT HAS A TENDENCY TO CONTRADICT  ITSELF. JUST YESTERDAY, OBAMA WAS  SIMULTANEOUSLY UP BY FOUR, DOWN  BY TWO, AND TIED WITH MITT  ROMNEY. ( LAUGHTER )  YEAH, PHILOSOPHY MAJORS IN THE  ( BLEEP ). ( APPLAUSE )  NOW YOU KNOW HOW UNEMPLOYED  PHILOSOPHY MAJORS ARE. ( LAUGHTER )  WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TODAY? I DON'T KNOW, LET'S GO TO SEE A  SHOW OR SOMETHING. WHAT'S THE DEAL? DOESN'T MATTER. WHY ARE WE EVEN HERE? I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER )  THE PROBLEM WITH THE POLLS IS  THAT THEY ARE TERRIBLE,  UNRELIABLE. AND INVALUABLE.
THE POLLING THIS YEAR IS THE  WORST IT'S EVER BEEN. THERE'S ALSO RASMUSSEN POLL THAT  HAS ROMNEY THREE HEY, 47-44.
A LOT OF THESE POLLS WHERE  YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT WITH,  LIKE, A FIVE- OR SIX-POINT LEAD,  YOU GO INTO THE INTERNALS AND YOU SEE THEY'VE BEEN  OVER-SAMPLING DEMOCRATS BY,  LIKE, NINE, OR EVEN, 10 OR EVEN  13 POINTS.
ACTUALLY, GREG, THERE WAS A  BRAND NEW NATIONAL BLOOMBERG  POLL RELEASED TODAY SHOWING  GOVERNOR ROMNEY LEADING PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE ISSUE OF  TERRORISM BY SIX POINT.
Jon:  HOW THE HELL ARE  THESE POLLS SO DIVERGENT,  USELESS, ACCURATE, YET QUOTABLE? I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE  NEED? NERDS!
WHEN YOU SEE OBAMAING GAINING  IN TODAY'S POLL, THAT MEANS  OBAMA'S INTERVIEWS YESTERDAY  WERE BETTER THAN SEVEN DAYS AGO CONDUCTED BEFORE THE DEBATE. HE WENT FROM THREE AHEAD IN THE  SEVEN-DAY TRACK YESTERDAY TO  FIVE AHEAD IN THE TRACK TODAY. THE NEXT ROUND OF SWING STATE  POLLS SHOWS THE SWING STATES  TIED, THEN DEMOCRATS REALLY  WILL-- IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO PANIC. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  NOBODY UNDERSTANDS  THESE THINGS BUT THOSE GUYS. AND THEY'RE NOT TELLING US  ANYTHING. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP  US GET A CLEARER PICTURE?
REAL CLEAR POLITICS DOESN'T  AVERAGE OF ALL THE POLLS.
NEW NATIONWIDE POLL OF POLLS.
WHEN YOU DO A POLL OF POLLS,  YOU GET A SNAPSHOT. YOU GET A TREND OF WHAT'S GOING  ON.
Jon:  OH, THE POLL OF  POLLS. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT. A POLL IS NO GOOD, BUT WHAT  ABOUT A POLL POLL. A POLL POLL WILL BE GOOD. NOT OF COURSE TO BE CONFUSED  WITH A POLL OF POLLS. THAT REMINDS ME OF A JOKE. HOW MANY POLLS DOES IT TAKE TO  CONDUCT AN OPINION POLL? IT'S 400 BECAUSE IN A COUNTRY OF  40 MILLION... THAT WOULD  CONSTITUTE A REPRESENTATIVE  SAMPLE. IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD JOKE. ( LAUGHTER ). FOR MORE ON THE LATEST  PRESIDENTIAL POLLS WE'RE JOINED  BY SENIOR POLL WATCHER JASON  JONES. JASON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THERE'S A LOT OF  CONTRADICTORY INFORMATION. SO WHICH POLLS SHOULD WE BE  PAYING ATTENTION TO?
WELL, THAT IS THE QUESTION,  ISN'T IT? WHICH POLLS TO THE PUNDITS  PREFER.
Jon:  I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T  KNOW YOU WORE GLASSES.
I DON'T. BUT THEY DON'T LET YOU IN THE  POLL WATCHER CLUB WITHOUT A PAIR  OF NERD GOGGLES.
Jon:  CAN YOU SEE OUT OF  THOSE AT ALL?
NOT A THING.
Jon:  WHICH POLLS ARE THE  PUNDITS FAVORING?
WELL, BEFORE THE DEBUT  MAJORITY WERE LEANING TOWARDS  PEW AND GALLUP, BUT LOOK WHAT'S  HAPPENED IN THE LAST WEEK AIR, MASSIVE THREE-POINT SWING  TOWARDS QUINNIPIAC AND ARG,  UNMARRIED PEOPLE PUNDITS AND  BLUE COLLAR BLOGGERS TWOK KEY  DEMOGRAPHICS.
Jon:  DO YOU THINK THAT'S A  SOFT BOUNCE OR STICKY BOUNCE. >
I'VE SEEN A LOT STICKIER,  JON. AFTER ALL, I'M A POLL WATCHER. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  POLL HUMOR FOR YOU.
WHEN YOU SLIDE DOWN THE POLL  THIS WEEK, RASMUSSEN IS GOING TO  BE FAVORED BY LIKELY PUNDITS BUT CNN INSTAPOLL POLL IS POLLING  WELL AMONG PUNDITS WHO NO LONGER  GIVE A BLEEP.
Jon:  THAT'S GOT TO BE A  BIG DEMOGRAPHIC.
IT'S THE BIGGEST DEMOGRAPHIC.
Jon:  ANY INDICATION OF  WHICH POLLS WILL PULL AWAY FROM  THE PACK?
LET'S LOOK AT OUR PAIL  TRACKING POLL TRACKING POLL. IT'S A GOOD DAY FOR GALLUP FIVE  DAY BUT A BAD DAY FOR ITS  THREE-DAY. BEAR IN MIND, ALL OF THAT COULD  CHANGE AS OF RIGHT NOW.
Jon:  WELL, OBVIOUSLY,  WHEN WE GET THE RESULT OF THE  LATEST ABC, "WASHINGTON POST,"  NABISCO.
JON, DON'T MAKE STUFF UP.
SORRY. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT ON ELECTION  DAY?
OUR FORECAST PREDICTS ON THE  NIGHT OF TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 6,  INTEREST IN POLLS WILL PLUNGE TO PER SENT PER.
Jon:  FASCINATING. ANY MARGIN OF ERROR?
NONE AT ALL. ZERO.
Jon:  THANK YOU, JASON  JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
