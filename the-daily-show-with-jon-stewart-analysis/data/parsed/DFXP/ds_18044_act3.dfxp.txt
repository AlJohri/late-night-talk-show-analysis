Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CBS NEWS  CHIEF WASHINGTON CREANT AND  MODERATOR OF "FACE THE NATION." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM MR. BOB SCHIEFFER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
WELL, HE DID NOT.
Jon: WELL, HE DID NOT. WHY IS IT THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU RECORD -- CAN YOU GO  THERE AND RECORD THE SUPREME  COURT? YOU CAN GET AWED YES RECORDING  YOU ARE JUST NOT APLOWED TO FILM  IT?
YES.
Jon: WHO MAKES THAT  DECISION? THE SUPREME COURT ARE THEY THE  ONES THAT WOULD CURTAIL THE  FIRST AMENDMENT?
YES.
Jon: FREEDOM OF THE PRESS  IS THAT THE ISSUE THERE?
THEY SEEM IF BE THE -- TO BE  THE ONE.
Jon: HOW MANY INAUGURATIONS  HAVE BEEN BEEN TO?
13 LYNDON JOHNSON 1964 WAS MY  FIRST. I CAME WITH MY MOM. THIS IS BEFORE I WORKED AT CBS  AND THEN MY FIRST ONE AS A  REPORTER WAS 1968 WITH RICHARD  NIXON.
Jon: OH, THAT WAS AN  EXCITING ONE.
YEAH.
Jon: THAT WAS ALL THE  COUNTER CULTURE.
I WAS ACTUALLY SENT DOWN ABBY  HOFFMAN.
Jon: SURE.
THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD  INAUGURATE A PIG WHILE HE WAS  INAUGURATED. THEY D. THAT WAS MY ASSIGNMENT. I WENT DOWN THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WAIT --
IT WAS RAINING.
Jon: I JUST WANT EVERYBODY  TO CATCH UP TO THIS FOR A  SECOND.
YES.
Jon: SO YOU WENT THERE AS A  ALL RIGHTER AND THEY SAID, BOB,  WE HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT FOR YOU.
FIRST ASSIGNMENT IN  WASHINGTON.
Jon: THERE'S THIS PIG -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- AND THEN --
THE PIG GOT OUT. THEY GOT THE PIG OUT AND IT WAS  RAINING AND WE CHASED THE PIG  AROUND. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I CALLED MY MOTHER THAT  NIGHT AND SHE SAID IT MUST HAVE  BEEN SO WONDERFUL. TELL ME ABOUT THE DRESSES THE  LADIES WE ARE AT THE INAUGURAL. I SAID MOM, I'M OUT HERE CHASING  A PIG IN THE RAIN. I DIDN'T GET INDOORS. YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE. I ALWAYS LOVED ANIMAL STORIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DID YOU CATCH THE PIG?
THEY CAUGHT IT, YEAH.
Jon: WOULD YOU THINK THAT  THE PIG'S SECURITY DETAIL WOULD  BE CATCHING UP ON THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT NOW, OTHER THAN THAT THE  BIG CONVERSATION IN THE COUNTRY  TWO OF THEM, I GUESS, FISCAL CLIFF AND THE GUN SITUATION. I'VE NOTICED THE ONE THING THAT  SEEMS MISSING FROM THE GUN  ARGUMENT, THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION, BUT YOU DON'T HEAR AN  ALL OF LOT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT,  PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT THE WAYS THEY DO PREVENT OR TOP THIS TYPE  OF VIOLENCE. DO YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL. SEEMS EXPLOSIVE BUT NOT  PRAGMATIC.
YOU TALK TO POLICE CHIEFS  THEY DO FAVOR, ESPECIALLY  HANDGUNS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jon: ARE THEY NOT ALLOWED  TO COME ON NEWS PROGRAMS. LIKE IN THE MILITARY IN UNIFORM  YOU CAN'T GO ON AND EXPRESS THE  OPINION OF THE ORGANIZATION YOU BELONG TO?
NO, WE'VE HAD THEM ON IN THE  PAST. WE'RE NOT HEARING FROM THEM  RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SUCH AN ISSUE.
Jon: YOU ARE NOT HEARING  ABOUT LOGISTICS. YOU ARE HEARING ABOUT GUNS ARE A  RIGHT THAT PEOPLE HAVE. HITLER TOOK AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS. I HEARD -- THERE WAS A GUY ON  WHO SAID, IF THE JEWS HAD HAD  BEEN ARMS, MAYBE THE HOL COST WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. THAT KIND OF THING. WHY DO THESE PEOPLE GET TO BE ON  TV? [ LAUGHTER ] DO YOU KNOW?
HE DID NOT -- OR WHAT WAS IT? I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD  QUESTION. I THINK WE -- IF WE'RE NOT GOING  TO DO SOMETHING NOW. IF KILLING LITTLE CHILDREN IN  KINDERGARTEN IS NOT ENOUGH TO  SAY WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING, WE'VE GOT TO GET SERIOUS. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHERE DO  YOU START WHERE DO YOU GO?
Jon: THAT'S A DIFFERENT  ANIMAL THAN THE TYPES OF GUN  VIOLENCE IN NEW YORK CITY ORGANIZE CHICAGO OR DETROIT. AND THERE MUST BE, I WOULD  THINK, LAW ENFORCEMENT VOICES  WHO COULD SPEAK OUT ON WHAT MAKES THEIR JOB EASIER OR WHAT  MAKES THEIR ABILITY TO STOP  EFFECTIVE. WHAT IS THE HE HAVE CASECY OF  THESE THINGS -- EFFICACY OF  THESE THINGS?
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. IT COMES TO THE PEOPLE TURNING  IT AROUND THAT SAYING THEY ARE  GOING TO TRY TO TAKE THE GUY'S GUN WHO GOES HUNT ORGANIZE LIVES  IN THE COUNTRY. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT KEEPING THESE WEAPONS  WITH THE TREMENDOUS KILLING  POWER OUT OF HANDS OF DERANGED  PEOPLE. THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ALL  THAT RADICAL AN IDEA. PEOPLE KEEP RAT POISONING IN THE  HOUSE TO KILL RODENTS BUT THEY  KEEP IT ON THE TOP SHELF. THEY DON'T KEEP IT WHERE THE  CHILDREN CAN GET IT.
Jon: I HAVE TO MAKE A  PHONECALL. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THERE DISCUSSION IN THE NEWS  ROOM, DO PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW SO  MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION IS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL  RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS? WILL HE BE ABLE TO GET THAT  THROUGH? WILL PEOPLE CALL IN TYRANNY AND  THREATEN? IT SEEMS THE MECHANICS OF  ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. IS THAT A CONCERN IN THE  NEWSROOM.
WE WONDER HOW CAN WE COVER  THIS? HOW CAN WE TELL THIS STORY? I CAN'T REMEMBER -- I THINK THE  PRESIDENT SAID IT WAS THE WORST  DAY OF HIS PRESIDENCY WHEN THEY TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS. THESE ARE NOT STORIES PEOPLE  LIKE TO COVER. AND WE'RE TRYING TO THINK HOW  CAN WE COVER THIS? HOW CAN WE BE FAIR AND HELP  PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE  ISSUES ARE? NOT THE ISSUES AS THEY ARE TOLD  ABOUT IT INTEREST GROUPS.
Jon: AND ADVOCATES. I IMAGINE THAT THAT SKEWS THE  DISCUSSION AND THEY ARE THE  EASIER PEOPLE TO BOOK. AND I THINK THAT KIND OF  CONFLICT PROBABLY DOES WELL  RATINGSWISE, I WOULD THINK.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Jon: YOU ARE A BIT OF A  BOMB THROWER OUT THERE. I SEE YOUR SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN YOU IS SAW DAVID GREGORY  HAVE THE HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE  CLIP? WE THOUGHT ABOUT, THAT'S IT I'M  COMING IN IN A TANK. I'LL SHOW THIS GUY.
WE THOUGHT ABOUT A BAZOOKA.
Jon: WE APPRECIATE YOU  BEING THERE. "FACE THE NATION" AIRS SUNDAY  MORNINGS ON
