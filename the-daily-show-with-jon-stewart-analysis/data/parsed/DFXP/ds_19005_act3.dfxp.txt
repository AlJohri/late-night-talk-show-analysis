[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WE'RE TALKING TO SECRETARY SEBELIUS ABOUT HEALTH CARE. LET ME TELL YOU WHY IT MAY SEEM I'M A LITTLE HARD ON THIS. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE SOMEWHAT BELIEVING THAT THE OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW IN WASHINGTON ARE CRAZY PEOPLE -- [LAUGHTER] -- IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT THAT BASICALLY SAYS THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN PEOPLE'S LIVES, IT FEELS LIKE IT'S FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO DEFEND SOMETHING THAT IS LESS THAN IDEAL, OR IS FUNCTIONING AT WHAT SEEMS TO BE A LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE THAT IS LARGER THAN WHAT IT SHOULD BE. SO IF YOUR ONLY OPTION IS CRAZY TOWN, THIS IS WHY I THINK PEOPLE ARE CLINGING TO THIS. BUT WHY -- LIKE THE 30 HOUR A WEEK THING. BUSINESSES ARE CUTTING WORKERS HOURS BELOW 30 TO AVOID FACING THE LAW OF OBAMACARE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?
AGAIN, AT LEAST THE ECONOMISTS, NOT ANECDOTAL FOLKS, BUT ECONOMISTS SAY THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT PART-TIME WORK IS GOING UP. IN FACT IT'S GOING DOWN. THE HEIGHT WAS IN THE RECESSION. IT'S GOING DOWN. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THIS COUNTRY, PART-TIME WORKERS AND THERE'S A LOT OF PART-TIME WORKERS THERE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE, WILL HAVE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING --
YOU BET. THEY'LL HAVE AN OPTION. NOT THE EMPLOYER OFFERING HELP BUT --
Jon: THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WILL END UP IN DIFFICULT TIMES HAVING TO SPEND MONEY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SPENT, YES? TO BUY HEALTH CARE IF THEY DID NOT HAVE IT OR WANT IT?
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL YES, PAY MONEY AND MANY OF THEM WILL PAY LESS THAN THAN THEY PAY FOR CABLE OR CELL PHONE A MONTH.
Jon: BUT FOR SOMEONE WHO LOVES CABLE --
AND GOD KNOWS WE ALL DO. I -- YOU KNOW, WE ALL DO.
Jon: BUT THE BASIC IDEA IS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS SOME OF YOU MAY FACE A PENALTY FOR THE GREATER GOOD IS WHAT THE   SUGGESTION IS
IT ALSO IS WE DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHEN YOU GET SICK.
Jon: NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
THE RULES OF THE COUNTRY ARE YOU GO THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOM DOOR, YOU GET TREATED AND SOMEBODY PICKS UP THE BILL. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE SICKER AND DIE YOUNGER WITHOUT INSURANCE.
Jon: WHICH IS WHY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF STAYING WITH A MARKET-BASED SOLUTION FOR A PROBLEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T BE SMART CONSUMERS THERE'S TOO MANY EXTERNALITIES IN HEALTH CARE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY BUSINESSES WOULDN'T JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO DECOUPLE HEALTH INSURANCE FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND WHY THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T JUMP AT THE CHANCE TO CREATE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM THAT SIMPLIFIES THIS WHOLE GARBLEY GUCK AND CREATES THE PROGRAM THAT I THINK AMERICA DESERVES. -- I DON'T GET IT.
WELL -- ♪  ♪  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: IT FEELS LIKE -- AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE FACING THE END OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION BY HAVING A MARKET-BASED STRATEGY.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
WE ARE BRINGING WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO ITS KNEES BY SELLING PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS ON A WEB SITE WHERE PEOPLE PICK AND CHOOSE. I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. I UNDERSTAND IF WE COULD HAVE PERHAPS FIGURED OUT A PATHWAY, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A REASONABLE SOLUTION.
Jon: SO THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN JERRY RIGGED TO DEAL WITH THE CRAZY PEOPLE. SO BY BENDING OVER TO DEAL WITH THE CRAZY PEOPLE WE NOW FACE DEFAULT. HAS THAT TAUGHT A LESSON?
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DID NOT WANT TO DISMANTLE THE HEALTH CARE THAT 85% OF THE COUNTRY HAD AND START ALL OVER AGAIN. THE END OF SIX MONTHS, WE HAVE 26 WEEKS OF OPEN ENROLLMENT, WE'LL HAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WITH AFFORDABLE.
Jon: CAN YOU RUN IT? THE V.A. HAS HUGE PROBLEMS LIKE I'M CONCERNED.
WE'RE NOT RUNNING THE INSURANCE PROGRAMS WE'RE RUNNING --
Jon: JUST THE ENROLLMENT.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT STARTED ROCKIER THAN WE WOULD LIKE.
Jon: WHY IS IT SO HARD?
IT'S BETTER TODAY AND IT WILL KEEP GETTING BETTER. HELP IS THERE THAT'S NEVER BEEN THERE. PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS GOOD FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES.
Jon: YEAH. THANK YOU FOR COMING BY AND I HOPE THINGS WORK OUT SECRETARY KATHLEEN SEBELIUS
