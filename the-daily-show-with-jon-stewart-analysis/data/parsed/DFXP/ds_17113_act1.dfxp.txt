2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW  YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. MAN OH, MAN OH, MAN OH, MAN. WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE LOVELY MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL WILL BE JOINING US. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EXCELLENT ACTRESS. AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONUX LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS AWAY, IT'S A TIME WHEN THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE REFLECT ON THE STATE OF NATION AND THE NEEDS OF ITS CITIZENRY, EXAMINE WHICH  PRESIDENT'S CANDIDATE WOULD BEST ADDRESS THESE URGENT AND CRITICAL TIME. ( LAUGHTER ). THAT'S OUR JOB. THEIR JOB IS TO RAISE AS MUCH ( BLEEP ) MONEY AS THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON. AND IT APPEARS THAT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE WIRE. TONIGHT... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT WAS OUR ENTIRE-- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN  OUR ENTIRE GRAPHICS BUDGET FOR THE YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ). PRESIDENT OBAMA, AS THE INCUMBENT, IN TERMS OF FUND-RAISING, APPEARS TO HAVE THE INSIDE TRACK.
THE PRESIDENT SHATTERING RECORDS FOR FUND-RAISING EVENTS. HE'S HELD EMERGENCY 150 SO FAR AS PRESIDENT. THAT'S NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER GEORGE W. BUSH ATTENDED DURING HIS WHOLE FIRST TERM.
Jon:  YEAH! MAYBE IF OBAMA WAS RUNNING AGAINST THIS CAT... ( LAUGHTER ) HE COULD PHONE IT IN, TOO. THAT'S JOHN KERRY BY THE WAY. YOU REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHO THAT WAS. YOU THOUGHT WHAT IS THAT, WOODY ALLEN, DRESSED LIKE A SPERM? REMEMBER THAT PICTURE FROM JOHN KERRY? ( LAUGHTER ) AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO WATCHES THIS ( BLEEP ) SHOW? ( LAUGHTER ) THE PICTURE OF ME AS A SPECIAL WON'T LOOK BAD, WILL IT? ( LAUGHTER ) THIS WON'T STOP ME FROM BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT. IT'S TRUE, JUST YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA ATTENDED SIX SEPARATE FUND RAISERS JUST IN THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR. WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVEN, BUT THAT WOULD BE A BIT MUCH, DON'T YOU THINK, SEVEN FUND RAISERS-- I  MEAN, COME ON. HE'S THE PRESIDENT. HE DOES NEED SOME DOWN TIME TO PLAN TOMORROW'S FUND RAISERS.
ACTRESS SARAH JESSICA PARKER AND "VOGUE" EDITOR HOLD AN EXCLUSIVE EVENT FOR THE  PRESIDENT'S REELECTION BID.
YOU KNOW THAT, THAT WAS A LITTLE DICKISH. IT'S ANNOYING THE PRESIDENT IS DOING FUND RAISERS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON THE ACSENT. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT THAT ON. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
I'M ANNA WINTER AND I'M SO LUCK NEMY WORK THAT I'M ABLE TO  MEET SOME OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE WOMEN IN THE WORLD. WOMEN LIKE SARAH JESSICA PARKER AND MICHELLE OBAMA. THESE TWO WONDERFUL WOMEN AND I ARE HOSTING A DINNER, ALONG WITH THE PRESIDENT, IN NEW YORK CITY  TO BENEFIT THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN.
Jon:  I TAKE IT BACK, I TAKE IT BACK. I TAKE IT BACK, THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD IMPRESSION OF ANNA WINTER. I HAD NO IDEA. I'M GLAD THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE WITH ANNA WINTER BECAUSE IF THERE ARE TWO THINGS THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE RELATE TO IT'S THE DEVIL AND PRADA. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, IT FEELS BENEATH OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY FOR OBAMA TO HAVE TO HUSTLE THIS  HARD FOR DOUGH ALL THE TIME BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? HE MADE $3.5 MILLION FROM THREE FUND RAISERS IN ONE DAY. BEAT THAT, MITT ROMNEY.
ACCORDING TO POLITICO, ROMNEY AND THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE RAISED ABOUT $77  MILLION IN MAY.
Jon:  SO! ( LAUGHTER ) ALL OBAMA HAS TO DO IS SIX FUND RAISERS A DAY FOR THE NEXT 22 TO  23 DAYS AND HE MATCHES YOU. AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO OTHER FUND-RAISING FACTORS I THINK WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE FINANCES  EVEN OUT.
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," OWN BIDE OUR PARENT COMPANY, REPORTS ONE SHELDON AIDLESON IS DONATING $10 MILLION TO A SUPERPAC SUPPORTING MITT ROMNEY.
Jon:  SHELDON AIDLE SON. HOLY ( BLEEP )! OBAMA IS WORKING HIS ASS OFF, SIX FUND RAISERS A DAY TRYING TO SQUEEZE A ME $3.5 MILLION. MEANWHILE, ROMNEY HAS AIDLESON GOING, "HEY, JEAN, WHY DON'T YOU  POP OFF I CHECK TO ROMNEY FOR $10 MILLION. YOU CAN SIGN IT." "ALL RIGHT, MR. AIDLESON, I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT."  SHELDON AIDLED SON GAVE $10 MILLION FOR MITT ROMNEY INSPECT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY I SEEM  TO REMEMBER HIS HIM BACKING ANOTHER ONE.
HE GAVE $2001 MILLION TO A PRO-GINGRICH PAC DURING THE PRIMARIES.
Jon:  THAT GUY! SHELDON AIDLESON WAS THE GUY WILLING TO SPEND AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY TO CRUSH MITT  ROMNEY BY BANK ROLLING ADS IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY LIKE THIS--
FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS, THE SUFFERING BEGAN WHEN NOME CAME TO TOWN.
I FEEL THAT IS THE MAN THAT DESTROYED US. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  BUT IN RETROSPECT, NOW I SEE WE PROBABLY DESERVED IT. ROMNEY 2012. ( LAUGHTER ) AIDLESON PUT OUT THAT AD AND STILL DONATED $10 MILLION TO ROMNEY. IMAGINE HOW MUCH MONEY HE WOULD GIVE IF HE LIKED HIM. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE SCREWED. NO AMOUNT OF UPSTATE COFFEE KLATCHES ARE GOING TO UP TO TO $10 MILLION. YOU NEED TO MONETIZE THIS PRESIDENCY. YOU'RE LEAVING TOO MUCH MONEY ON THE TABLE. THERE'S NO REASON THE NEXT JOINT SESSION CAN'T BE MONETIZED. BOOM. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THE NEXT STATE OF THE UNION IS  SURPRISINGLY REFRESHING. AND DON'T STOP THERE. REMEMBER WHEN YOU OVERSAW THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. YOU MUST KNOWN THIS PHOTO WOULD GO VIRAL. YOU HAD TONG OF IT AS AN ASSASSIN-OPPORTUNITY. AND BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF TONY THE TIGER WHO IS IN THERE, HOW ABOUT YOUR OWN PRODUCT LINE? OH, SILLY RABBIT. TAKE THE SHOT. TAKE THE SHOT. ( APPLAUSE ) ( BLEEP ) THAT RABBIT. ( LAUGHTER ) SO HE'S TAKEN CEREAL FROM CHILDREN. IT'S NOT RIGHT. TAKE THE SHOT. ( LAUGHTER ) PLUS, MR. PRESIDENT WHAT, ABOUT SOME RETAIL OPPORTUNITIES.
TYLER SULLIVAN WENT TO SEE PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVE A SPEECH LAST FRIDAY AND THE PRESIDENT  OFFERED TO MAKE SURE TYLER DIDN'T GET AN UNEXCUSED ABSENT.
HE CAME UP AND HE ASKED ME IF HE WANTED AN EXCUSE NOTE SINCE I WAS MISSING SCHOOL FRIDAY.
Jon:  BOOM! AND AN EXTRA 20 BUCKS GETS THAT KID OUT OF GYM FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. ( LAUGHTER ). MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE A LIKABLE GUY WITH A LOT OF TALENTS, AND  IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN PRESIDENT, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLOIT ALL OF THEM.
IS THAT BALM ROCK?
IT SURE IS.
WELL, TURN IT UP.
OBAMA ROCK WITH ALL THE PRESIDENT'S TOM HITS. "LET'S STAY TOGETHER." "SWEET HOME CHICAGO."  "LET'S STAY TOGETHER." AND WHO COULD FORGET "SWEET HOME CHICAGO."
SMOOTH. HEY, HOW MUCH IS OBAMA ROCK?
THOSE TWO SONG FRAGMENTS CAN BE YOURSELF FOR JUST $2,500.
YOU MEAN THE STATUTORY LIMIT FOR INDIVIDUAL LIMITS TO A CANDIDATE FOR FEDERAL OFFICE FOR ELECTION.
MAKE CHECK OR MONEY ORDER CARE OF:  SEND YOUR MONEY NOW.
IKE RIGHT NOW. BALM ROCK. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon
