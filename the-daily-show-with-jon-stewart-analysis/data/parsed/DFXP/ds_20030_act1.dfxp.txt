FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY, VERY GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. BY POPULAR DEMAND, OUR GUEST TONIGHT SOPHIE DELAUNAY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DOCTORS WITHOUT BOARDERS, SHE IS HERE TONIGHT TO LOOK AT THIS THING ON MY ANKLE. A LOVELY COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUAL AS THEY ALL ARE. BUT FIRST, I WANT TO FIRST TALK TO YOU NOW ABOUT PROFESSIONAL FUTBOL. THE AMERICAN BRAND. IT HAS CERTAINLY SEEN ITS SHARE OF CONTROVERSY THIS YEAR FROM A GAY PLAYER THAT APPARENTLY COULDN'T HIT HARD ENOUGH IS TO A STRAIGHT PLAYER THAT COULD BUT PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE, SHOULDN'T OF HIT AT ALL, REALLY. TO A TEAM THAT ON PAPER BEFORE THE SEASON SHOULD OF BEEN IN THE HUNT. I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES, HE'S A TWO TIME SUPERBOWL WINNING MVP. DO WE HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE, DO WE NOT HAVE AN OFFENSIVE LINE? AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THE PREDICTION SCHEMES ARE NOT ONLY ILL-DESIGNED BUT ALSO HILARIOUSLY UNDEREXECUTED? THE POINT IS THIS [BEEP] ODELL BECKHAM JR., MAN. OKAY. NOT A FOOTBALL CROWD. MORE OF A JOURNALISM CROWD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JOURNALISM, NO. UCB, YES. I GIVE, BY THE WAY, THE WORST CAREER ADVICE IN THE HISTORY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. YOU SHOULD YOU DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND START HANGING OUT AROUND THAT IMPROV THEATER. THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, LADY. ANYWAY MY POINT IS THIS, THERE IS MORE FOOTBALL CONTROVERSY.
MEMBERS OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS COMING ON THE FIELD WITH AN UNEXPECTED MESSAGE. PUTTING THEIR HANDS UP. DON'T SHOOT. WHAT'S BECOME A SYMBOL OF THE PROTESTS FOLLOWING FERGUSON.
Jon: SYMBOLE OF THE PROTESTS? IT'S FOOTBALL. I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE JUST GOING, HEY FELLAS LET'S SCORE SOME TOUCH DOWNS. OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST PREPARING TO DANCE AT TEVYE'S DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. ♪ SUBMISSION ♪ I'VE GOT NO GUN, SUBMISSION A RARE INSTANCE OF SOCIAL AWARENESS FROM THE NFL. JOINING IN A COMMON SIGNAL OF SOLIDARITY. LIKE THAT "HUNGER GAMES" KATNISS THREE FINGER SALUTE. OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY THE DISTRICT 11 RESIDENTS WHO HELD UP THEIR HANDS LIKE THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED BY THE POLICE, WHICH IS WHERE OUR METAPHOR -- ALRIGHT. ANYWAY, WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?
THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY POLICE ASSOCIATION CALLING THE GESTURE TASTELESS, OFFENSIVE AND INFLAMMATORY. THEY WANT THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE TO APOLOGIZE AND TO PUNISH THE PLAYERS.
TO US IT SEEMS LIKE RATHER THAN ALLOWING WOUNDS TO HEAL THAT THEY'RE FOLKS PICKING AT THE SCABS. [BOOING]
Jon: HOLY [BEEP]. SO THE ST. LOUIS POLICE ASSOCIATION IS ANGRY AND OUTRAGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THIS HAIL OF GESTURES AND FEELS THAT THE COMMUNITY WON'T GET PAST THIS TRAGIC PANTOMINE UNLESS SOMEONE IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THAT'S THE ANGLE THEY'RE GOING WITH. ALRIGHT. ST. LOUIS RAMS COACH, JEFF FISHER.
THEY WILL NOT BE DISCIPLINED BY THE CLUB NOR WILL THEY BE DISCIPLINED BY THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE. >>Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION WHEN DID NICK NOLTE TAKE OVER THE RAMS. YEAH, FISHER THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING! A NOLTE JOKE. HE'S A RAGTOP COACH. ALRIGHT, SO I GUESS WE'VE GOT OURSELVES AN OLD FASHION POLICE DEPARTMENT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM STAND OFF. WHO IS GOING TO BLINK?
THE RAMS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER CALLED THE ST. LOUIS POLICE CHIEF CALLED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE RAMS' HANDS UP DON'T SHOOT GESTURE DURING SUNDAY'S GAME.
Jon: OH, I THOUGHT, ACTUALLY I THOUGHT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE.
THE RAMS OFFICIAL, HOWEVER, NOW DENIES APOLOGIZING. HE SAYS IN PART IN NONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS DID I APOLOGIZE FOR OUR PLAYERS' ACTIONS.
Jon: ISN'T IT INTERESTING HOW WITNESS TESTIMONY IS SO UNRELIABLE. WELL, HOW CAN WE, HOW CAN WE IN ANY WAY HOW CAN WE CLEAR THIS UP? HOW DO WE CLEAR IT UP?
IN A TESTY AND BIZARRE EXCHANGE OF TWEETS AND STATEMENTS OVER NIGHT POLICE CLAIM THE RAMS APOLOGIZED. BUT THE RAMS SAID NO. THEN THE POLICE TWEETED THE DEFINITION OF APOLOGY INCLUDING WORDS "EXPRESSION OF REGRET."
Jon: AND THEN, AND THEN THE RAMS TWEETED WTF POLICE? #UNFOLLOW AND THEN, AND THEN THE POLICE WERE ALL, THANKS OBAMA #NOTALLCOPS. AND THEN, AND THEN THE RAMS WERE LIKE THIS COULD BE US, BUT YOU PLAYING. [LAUGHING] LISTEN, I SEE THE CONFUSION HERE. THE RAMS MADE THE SORRY IF YOU WERE OFFENDED NON-APOLOGY NOBODY EVER BELIEVES IS AN ACTUAL APOLOGY AND INSTEAD OF REJECTING THE NON-APOLOGY OUTRIGHT LIKE A NORMAL GROUP, THE COPS CONFUSED THINGS EVEN MORE ACCEPTING IT FORCING THE RAMS TO CLARIFY THE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF THEIR ORIGINAL NON-APOLOGY WHICH MEANS AT LEAST FINALLY IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE HAVING THE IMPORTANT NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT SEMANTICS, WE NEED. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT AND HOST OF THE UPCOMING "NIGHTLY SHOW WITH LARRY WILLMORE." MR. LARRY WILLMORE. NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M EXCITED ABOUT "THE NIGHTLY SHOW."
THANK YOU.
Jon: I'M EXCITED. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
"THE NIGHTLY SHOW," WHEN DOES THAT START?
Jon: I BELIEVE ACTUALLY JANUARY 19TH.
OH YES. MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. I HAVE A JOB.
Jon: LARRY, IF I MAY. THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK THAT NONE OF THESE EVENTS OF THE PAST FEW WEEKS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABOUT RACE.
THE REAL EPIDEMIC IS YOUNG BLACK MEN KILLING OTHER YOUNG BLACK MEN.
93% OF BLACKS ARE SHOT BY OTHER BLACKS. THEY'RE KILLING EACH OTHER THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN DO YOU HEAR THEM TALK ABOUT, HOW DO WE REDUCE THE CRIME.
Jon: WELL, YOU KNOW, LARRY, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE? >>OH I DON'T KNOW, JON. I WOULD SAY THEY SHOULD PROBABLY GO [BEEP] THEMSELVES. MAYBE?
Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
WELL NO, JON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ALRIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, CAN WE QUIT CALLING IT BLACK ON BLACK CRIME. IT'S JUST CRIME, OKAY. I MEAN, BLACK ON BLACK JUST MAKES IT SOUND LIKE A CATEGORY ON RED TUBE. THAT'S A PORN SITE, JON.
Jon: OH, THAT'S A -- OH YES, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S A --
YOU HAVE IT BOOKMARKED. Jon: DO I HAVE IT BOOKMARKED? I ONLY BOOKMARK IT SO I CAN PICK UP WHERE I LEFT OFF IN THE STORY.
WHERE DID YOU LEAVE OFF? Jon: THEY WERE [BEEP]. [LAUGHING] SO, SPOILER ALERT. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU HOW IT ENDS BUT GET A TOWEL. YOU DON'T THINK A CONVERSATION ABOUT BLACK ON BLACK CRIME SHOULD BE HAPPENING NOW?
IT IS, JON. BUT IT'S A BLACK ON BLACK CONVERSATION. I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT HEARING IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT HAPPENING. GO TO ANY BLACK CHURCH ON A SUNDAY.
Jon: WELL THAT'S -- SEE, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT CONVERSATION. COULD I LISTEN TO IT SOME TIME?
SURE WHICH BLACK CHURCH DO YOU ATTEND, BROTHER?
Jon: I TWO GO TO THE FIRST TEMPLE BAPTIST BLACK CHURCH.
THAT'S OKAY, JON. I DON'T GO EITHER.
Jon: OH, ALRIGHT. THANK YOU.
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE BLACK CRIMINALS ARE THE ONLY THING KILLING BLACK PEOPLE. DIABETES, STROKE AND HEART DISEASE ARE KICKING BLACK ON BLACK CRIME'S ASS. OKAY? BUT NOBODY IS SAYING WE NEED TO GET GET RID OF THOSE BEFORE WE CAN TALK ABOUT RACISM.
Jon: WELL SO, DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE USING THIS ARGUMENT AS A WAY TO INVALIDATE THE RIGHTEOUS NATURE OF ANY OF THE PROTESTS.
WELL, JON. PEOPLE ARE USING A LOT OF ARGUMENTS TO INVALIDATE THE PROTESTS.
THE PROTESTERS WHO DID NOT LOOT OR BURN OR ASSAULT THE POLICE BUT WHO REMAINED IN THE FRAY ARE GUILTY OF AIDING AND ABETTING THOSE WHO DID BY PROVIDING THEM COVER AND SUPPORT. IT SET BACK RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA YEARS. THE VIOLENT PROTESTS ACTUALLY CREATED MORE BIAS AGAINST BLACKS. [BOOING]
[BEEP] MORE BIAS AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE. OH, NO BLACK PEOPLE, WE WERE SO CLOSE. WHAT DID YOU DO? STUPID BLACK PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A DREAM, JON. THAT ONE DAY THE ACTIONS OF A FEW [BLEEP] WHITE PEOPLE WILL BE SEEN AS DISCREDITING THEIR ENTIRE RACE.
Jon: WELL, EVERYONE KEEPS MAKING EXCUSES. BE IT CRIME OR OTHER ISSUES. FOR WHY WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT RACISM. OR WHY IT'S NOT RACISM. HOW DO WE END RACISM?
JON, WE WON'T END IT. THE WORLD HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS. BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER. TRIBE AGAINST TRIBE. IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO GO AWAY. IT'S PART OF OUR DNA. WE'RE RACEAHOLICS, JON. WE WILL ALWAYS BE IN RECOVERY . THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR IS TO MANAGE IT.
Jon: SO, I GUESS WE'RE NEVER ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THAT 30-DAY CHIP ARE WE?
30 DAY CHIP? WE CAN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT EVEN AT THE MEETING YET. WE'RE STILL LYING IN A POOL OF OUR OWN VOMIT GOING, I'M FINE, I'M FINE. JUST GOTTA -- I'LL BE OKAY.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LARRY. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
