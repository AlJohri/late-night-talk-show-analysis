FEBRUARY 21, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, MAN! DO I HAVE A TERRIBLE COLD. WE DO HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FROM THE NEW SHOW OUR AMERICA LISA LING WILL BE JOINING US. PART OF OUR ALL NEW ALLITERATION WEEK. TOMORROW NIGHT TONY TUNE WILL BE HERE. TOMMY TUNE. I DON'T KNOW IF MY EARS ARE FOGGED OR IF THAT WAS GREETED WITH COMPLETE AND TOTAL SILENCE. (LAUGHING) AND MAY I SAY THIS. YOU ARE CORRECT. WE BEGIN' IN WISCONSIN WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF (DRAMATIC MUSIC) OH, NO. OH, YES, OF COURSE. THE POOR COWS JUST GOT MILK ALL OVER THEM. IN A FEW PLACES WAS THE TEA PARTY'S SWEEP LAST NOVEMBER. RUSS FEINGOLD WAS TOSSED FROM THE SENATE. OVERTURNED DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLYS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS ELECTED A  REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER.
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SPEND MILLIONS MORE OF OUR TAX DOLLARS THAN THEY NEED FOR  EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE. WE CAN SAVE $68 MILLION PER YEAR JUST BY LETTING SCHOOLS GET INTO THE STATE HEALTH PLAN.
Jon: THAT RELAXED GUY ON SOMEONE ELSE'S COUCH IS RIGHT. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE WEISS CON ONPEOPLE WERE PREPARED WHEN THEIR NEWLY ELECTED GOVERNOR  TRIED TO INSTITUTE HIS COST- SAVING PLAN AND WERE PREPARED FOR THE... OH, WAIT. I SEE NOW.
BE RIGHT BACK.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. GUYS! HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO REVIS IT THE BENEFIT PLANS OF TEACHERS AND STATE WORKERS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
STATE WORKERS, A LOT OF THEM TEACHERS, SERIOUS OVER... FURIOUS OVER GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO CUT THEIR BENEFITS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS.
Jon: OH! SO HE'S NOT ONLY CUTTING UNION MEMBERS' BENEFITS. HE ALSO WANTS THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR ABILITY TO EVER ASK FOR THEM AGAIN. THAT KN BE RIGHT. TAKE AWAY A UNION'S RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I BELIEVE THAT MAKES THEM JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WEARING IDENTICAL T-SHIRTS. CALL THEM THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. THEY KN PLAY FOOTBALL. THEY'RE TELLING CRAIGSLIST NO ADULT SERVICES. IT REALLY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE. I'M SURE THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT THE PLEASANT CASUALLY DRESSED MAN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT MEANT.
FOR US THIS IS ABOUT BALANCING THE BUDGET. WE'VE GOT A $3.6 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT. WE'RE BROKE. JUST LIKE NEARLY EVERY OTHER STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'RE BROKE.
Jon: HE'S BROKE. THE GUY IS WALKING AROUND WITH NOTHING. WELL, AS OF YET WALKER HASN'T PROPOSED ANY OTHER SPECIFIC CUTS TO THE BUDGET. HE'S GOING TO DO IT TOMORROW. AND HE'S EVEN PASSED A PLAN TO FURTHER REDUCE REDUCE TAX REVENUES FOR THE STATE AND TAX BREAKS. HE'S NOT LOOKING TO STRIP THE UNION OF ITS POWER. JUST LOOKING FOR SAVINGS.
THE DEAL WOULD BE THAT THE UNIONS AGREE ON THE MONEY ISSUES BUT THEY KEEP THEIR  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS. GOVERNOR, ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THAT?
WELL, NO.
Jon: SO TO CLOSE THE $3.6 BILLION BUDGET GAP THE UNION MUST DIE. LESS OF A FISCAL SACRIFICE MORE OF A RITUAL SACRIFICE TO APIECE THE GODS OF DEFICIT. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE REMAINING 14 STATE SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE A  FIELD DAY WITH THIS DUDE.
IN AN EFFORT TO POSTPONE THE VOTE, 14 DEMOCRATIC SENATORS FLED THE STATE.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHEN THEY SAY WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, THE TOUGH GET GOING. I DON'T THINK THAT'S MEANT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY. OH, HONEY, PACK YOUR BAGS. THE GOING IS GETTING TOUGH. THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN MAKE THEIR CASE DIRECTLY. THE ELEGANCE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY IN ITS PUREST FORM.
YOU TALK ABOUT COMING TO THE TABLE. THE GOVERNOR COME TO GO THE TABLE. DO YOU THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT TACTIC FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS?
UNITED WE STAND. UNITED WE STAND. UNITED WE STAND. UNITED WE STAND. UNITED WE STAND.
Jon: I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M BEING TOLD THAT WE HAVE A SATELLITE DELAY TO THE '60s. I'M SORRY. THEY GOT ALL CHANTY ON HER. ALL RIGHT. A GOVERNOR ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE TO CUT COSTS FIRST ATTEMPT AT DOING SO COMES AT  THE EXPENSE OF THOSE THAT ARE IN HIS EMPLOYEN RAGING THEM. I BELIEVE THIS IS A RECIPE FOR THE WORST CHRISTMAS PARTY EVER. BUT, B, THERE'S SOMETHING FAMILIAR TO THE DYNAMICS OF THIS POLITICAL BACK-AND-FORTH.
IS MADISON WISCONSIN, CONGRESSMAN, THE TUNISIA OF AMERICAN POLITICS NOW?
THERE IS A UNBELIEVABLE PARALLEL TO PEOPLE IN THE STREETS OF CAIRO AND THE  PEOPLE IN MADISON WISCONSIN.
THE THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS ARE CLEARLY INSPIRED BY THE PRO DEMOCRACY  PROTESTORS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
Jon: THEY'RE NOT THE SAME IN ANY (BEEP) WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM AT ALL. AT ALL. NOT AT ALL. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THIS IS THE SAME AS PEOPLE IN  THE MIDDLE EAST OVERTHROWING YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP OR IS THAT JUST THE LAST STORY YOU  SAW ON THE NEWS? YOU KNOW, THE PROTESTS IN WISCONSIN REMIND ME OF THE STRUGGLES OF ACTOR CHARLIE SHEEN. BRAVELY FIGHTING HIS ADDICTION WHICH IN THIS ANALOGY MAKES GOVERNOR WALKER CRACK. WAIT, NO. LOOK, IF I MAY, THERE ARE A FEW SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS AND CAIRO. THE EGYPTIAN PROTESTORS RISK BEING SHOT. THE WISCONSIN PROTESTORS RISK BEING CAUGHT IN A DRUM CIRCLE. AS FOR PROTESTORS' CHA THAT WALKER'S IS A TYRANT. I REMIND YOU HE WAS ELECTED WITH 54% OF THE VOTE. TYRANTS WITH IN THE HIGH 90s. REPORTERS WERE BRUTALLY BEATEN. I'M SURE YOU CAN COME UP WITH A MORE APPROPRIATE COMPARISON.
MANY OTHER STATES ULTIMATELY MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME BALANCE SHEET AS WISCONSIN BUT I THINK  ULTIMATELY COLLECT TIFF BARGAINING FROM A FEDERAL LEVEL THESE ARE BIG ISSUES. THESE COSTS NEED TO BE PUT UNDER CONTROL. IF THE COUNTRY IS EVER ATTACKED LIKE IT WAS ON 9/11, WE ALL RESPOND WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. WHAT'S GOING ON ON BALLANCE SHEETS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS THE SAME TYPE OF ATTACK.
Jon: THANK... WAIT! THAT'S INSANE. COLLECTIVE PAR GAINING AND UNIONS ARE THEN AL QAEDA FOR BALANCE SHEETS? WHAT DOES THAT MAKE WALL STREET? BY THE WAY YOU WORK FOR C-NBC AND SINCE YOUR NETWORK HELPED PROMOTE THAT DISASTER I GUESS  YOU'RE AL JAZEERA. WELL, THE BUDGET CRISIS IS NOT CAIRO. IT'S NOT GROUND ZERO. WHAT IS IT?
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE VITRIOL AND THE VIOLENT RHETORIC BEING SPEWED BY THESE  LEFT WING UNIONS AT THESE RALLIES. PEOPLE LOOKING TO CREATE CHAOS. ON THE BACKS OF THE WORKER.
THESE UNION THUGS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE CAPITAL. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF....
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH THE LEFT WING IN AMERICA.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL CHUTZPA? THAT'S GIVING ME A LOT OF... WAIT A SECOND, FOX. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS LOVED PROTESTS AND THE AMERICANS TO TAKE TO THE STREETS. REMEMBER THE TEA PARTY.
THESE ARE ORDINARY DECENT HARD WORKING AMERICANS.
THEY'RE SINGING GOD BLESS AMERICA.
THESE ARE AVERAGE EVERYDAY PEOPLE.
GOD FEARING FREEDOM LOVING PATRIOTS.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED? BUT IF MY THEORIES ARE CORRECT, IF MY ANALOGY IS TO WORK, THEN THERE MUST BE ANOTHER NEWS NETWORK THAT HATES THE TEA  PARTY PROTESTS BUT LOVES THE WISCONSIN UNION PROTESTS.
TEA PARTY WHACKOS ARE DEAD SET ON REREPEALING THE HEALTH CARE LAW.
THESE ARE REAL AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO WANT A FUTURE AND FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING  DEPRIVED OF IT.
Jon: THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WHACKOS. DON'T YOU GET WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? THE UNION WISCONSIN PROTEST IS THE BIZARRE-O TEA PARTY. YES! YOU'VE ALL SEEN THAT EPISODE OF SUPERMAN. BUT, WAIT. IF THIS IS CORRECT, TEA PARTYERS WEAR TRI-CORNERED HATS. WHAT WOULD THE OPPOSITE OF THAT BE? ALL RI
