Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, IF I MAY  TELL, I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO  ENJOY IT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS KEN BURNS  DOCUMENTARINA. AND BY THAT I MEAN A PERSON WHO  ONLY EATS DOCUMENTARIES. [ LAUGHTER ] STRICT DOCUMENT ARIAN. BIG NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON ON  THE GUN CONTROL FRONT.
THE FIRST BIG BIPARTISAN  BREAKWILLTHROUGH ON GUN LEGISLATION.
BREAKTHROUGH THIS MORNING ON  GUN CONTROL.
Jon: IT'S OH, MY GOD --  THEY FINALLY INVENTED A GUN THAT  KILLS OTHER GUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WON'T FIRE IF YOU ARE CRAZY. CAN'T THEY DO THAT? CAN'T THEY INVENT A GUN THAT  DOESN'T FIRE IF YOU ARE CRAZY? [LAUGHTER] IT WAS A BIPARTISAN GUN CONTROL  PROPOSAL. I'M BEING ABOUT TO SHOW YOU  SOMETHING. THESE TWO SENATORS MANCHIN OF  WEST VIRGINIA, TOOMEY OF  PENNSYLVANIA REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTIES AND THEY ARE GOING TO  STAND TOGETHER ON TELEVISION  WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF EACH OTHER AND YET THEY WILL NOT  FIGHT. LET'S HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO  SAY.
BACK HOME WHERE I COME FROM  WE HAVE COMMON SENSE, NONSENSE  AND NOW WE HAVE GUNSENSE.
Jon: INTERESTING HE BRINGS  UP GUNSENSE, I ACTUALLY SAW THAT  OFF BROADWAY IN THE 90s. AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M SORRY I CUT YOU OFF  BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE GOOD PART.
WHAT OUR MEASURE WILL DO IT  WILL EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS TO  PURCHASES OF FIREARMS AT GUN SHOWS AND OVER THE INTERNET.
Jon: SPEAK OF WHICH, HOLY  (bleep) YOU CAN BUY GUNS OVER  THE INTERNET? AND WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECK? SHOULDN'T GUN PURCHASES HAVE AT  LEAST THE SAME PROCEDURAL RIGORS  APPLIED TO PORN SITE SCREENINGS? [LAUGHTER] YES. YES. NOW, MR. WE GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN  THE RARE SIGHTING OF -- BEFORE  WE GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE RARE SIGHTING OF TWO BIPARTISAN MEN  MAKING SWEET, SWEET LAW WITH  EACH OTHER LET'S REMEMBER ONE  THING.
TODAY IS THE START WITH THE  HEALTHY DEBATE THAT MUST END  WITH THE SENATE AND HOUSE HOPEFULLY PASSING THE  COMMONSENSE MEASURES AND THE  PRESIDENT SIGNING NIGHT LAW.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT THE HUGE  BREAKTHROUGH ANNOUNCED ON THE  NEWS IS A PROPOSAL BY THESE TWO GUYS THAT IN AND OF ITSELF FALLS  SHORT OF ANY OF THE SYSTEMIC  MEASURES ENING VISIONED POST NEWTOWN, ARIZONA, AERRORA,  COLORADO, WE SHOOT A LOT. YOU GET THAT. THIS MUST GET THROUGH THE HOUSE  AND THE SENATE. WE ALL KNOW WHEN IT LEAVES THE  HOUSE IT WILL HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY  TRANSFORMED. YEAH, THAT'S IT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHY THE HOUSE IS GOING  TO TRANSFORM IT? BECAUSE THE HOUSE (bleep)  CRAZIEST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENS TO  IT IN THE SENATE EITHER. THE UNITED NATIONS AKA THE MOST  FASHIONABLE ANTI-VIOLENCE SHOW  ROOM.
IT REGULATES THE TRANSFER OF  LIGHT WEAPONS TO COMBAT AIRCRAFT  AND ENSURE THEY WON'T BE USED TO THE COMMIT ACTS OF TERROR OR  ORGANIZED CRIME.
Jon: AKA THE BOND VIABLE  PREVENTION TREATY. SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHAT  HAPPENED NEXT.
THIS PAST WEEKEND THE SENATE  PASSED AN AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY  PROHIBITING THE U.S. FROM SIGNING ON TO THE TREATY.
Jon: OF COURSE THEY DID. IF THEY DON'T PRESERVE OUR  RIGHTS TO SELL GUNS TO  TERRORISTS, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO FIGHT US WITH? [LAUGHTER] IDEAS? COME ON! ACTUALLY, THE REASON WE CANNOT  SUPPORT A TREATY TO STOP THE  TERRORIST AND DRUGLORDS ARM TRADE --
TED CRUX SAYS IT SHOULD BE  REJECTED IT'S INTERNATIONAL GUN  REGULATION AND SHOULD NOT BE  RATIFIED.
IT'S LAID WITHIN LANGUAGE  THAT COULD YOU DRIVE A TANK  THROUGH THAT THREATENS SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF ALL  AMERICANS.
Jon: HOW DID THIS BECOME  ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. TREATY REAFFIRMS THE SOVEREIGN  RIGHT OF ANY STATE TO REGULATE A  CONVENTIONAL ARMS PURSUANT TO ITS LEGAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL  SYSTEM. IF YOU CAN LINK THAT TO A THREAT  ON YOUR GUN OWNERSHIP THROUGH  SOME BIZARRO SIX DEGREES OF CHARLTTON HESTON GAME.
THE TRADE TREATY IS SAY  TREATY THAT SEIZED OUR AUTHORITY  TO HAVE TRADE -- TRADE AGREEMENT WITH OUR ALLIES IN TERMS OF THE  TRADING ARMS.
Jon: A TREATY THAT CEDES  OUR AUTHORITY TO THE UNITED  NATIONS. IT'S A SYMBOLIC THING. IT'S LIKE SIGNING THAT GIANT GET  WELL CARD TO CAROL. IT DIDN'T COST YOU ANYTHING AND  YOU HAVEN'T CEDED YOUR AUTHORITY  TO WISH HER ILL. BUT YOU DON'T SIGN YOU LOOK LIKE  AN (bleep). THE UNITED NATIONS PASSED NINE  REGULATIONS AGAINST ISRAEL IN  ONE DAY. IRAN IS THE RESOLUTION A MONTH  CLUB. REMEMBER WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS  REJECTED OUR IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION  THUS FROM PREVENTING US FROM WHAT MIGHT HAVE TURNED INTO A  DECADE LONG, TRLZ OF DOLLARS,  THOUSANDS OF CASUALTIES  QUAGMIRE. WE WERE LIKE WE SHOULD INVADE  IRAQ AND THE U.N. SAID NO AND WE  WERE LIKE, OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] SO LOOK THE SENATE REJECTED IT. THEY REJECTED THAT TREATY AND  I'M SURE THAT IN NO WAY PUTS THE  UNITED STATES SENATE IN TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE COMPANY.
IT WAS OVERWHELMINGLY  APPROVED 154-3 WITH IRAN, NORTH  KOREA WHY AND SYRIA VOTING AGAINST IT.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT. THANK YOU UNITED STATES SENATE,  WE HAVE LITERALLY BECOME ONE OF  OUR OWN WORST ENEMIES. WE'LL WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS A
