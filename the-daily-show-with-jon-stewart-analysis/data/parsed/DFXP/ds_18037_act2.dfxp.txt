Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. NOW, IF YOU LOOKED AT THE  CALENDAR TODAY OR TALKED WITH  ANYONE, YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A VERY SPECIAL DAY. 12/12/12. IT IS THE DATA THE MAYANS PROF  SEIZED AS THE BEGINNING OF THE  SHIFT THAT CULMINATION ON THE END OF THE WORLD ON 12/21 OR SO  I READ IN NEW AGE [BLEEPED] MONTHLY. [LAUGHTER] THE CRYSTALS ARTICLE IS SOMEWHAT  CONTROVERSIAL. DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT THE  MAYANS WERE CLEARLY NOT THE BEST  AT PREDICTING WHEN CIVILIZATION WOULD END, MAYANS, HOW SCARED  SHOULD WE REALLY BE? WHAT COULD HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW  AND DECEMBER 21st THAT COULD  TRIGGER GLOBAL ANNIHILATION.
NORTH KOREA TODAY ENTERED THE  SPACE AGE, APPARENTLY PUTTING A  SATELLITE INTO ORBIT. [SPEAKING NORTH KOREAN] [CHEERING]
PEOPLE IN THE CAPITAL SEEMED  TO WELCOME THE NEWS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SORRY ABOUT THAT  OUTDOOR JUBILANT CROWD, DIDN'T  SEEM QUITE RIGHT, LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NOBODY OUTSIDE  THAT'S NOT IN THE CROWD, BUT  IT'S NOT A VERY BIG CROWD AND THEY ALL SEEM TO BE AROUND THE  SAME AGE AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE  BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO TELL THEM TO COMMENCE WITH THE JUNE  LENS, PERHAPS AT GUNPOINT. IT MUST BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO  GATHER A GROUP WHO CAN BE FORCED  TO CHEER FOR YOU NO MATTER WHAT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SUCK ON, THAT KIM JUNG. NOT THAT I HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT  THAT WOULD BE LIKE, BUT LET ME  TRY IT WITH THIS CROWD. HEY, EVERYBODY, TONIGHT'S FIFTH  NIGHT OF HANUKKAH. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT WAS KIND OF FUN. NOT YOU, THEM. GIVE THEM CHANCE. HEY, EVERYBODY. I'VE GOT A POTATO WE CAN SHARE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING TO NOT  TRUST THEIR RESPONSE. HEY, EVERYBODY. I'VE GOT CHLAMYDIA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] SEEMS SOMEWHAT SCORNFUL. BY THE WAY, SOURCES SAY THE  UNITED STATES WAS TAKEN BY  SURPRISE BY THE MISSILE LAUNCH. WELL, FUNNY STORY, HERE'S WHAT  WE WERE UP TO JUST  BEFORE.
TODAY
