FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART! [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW", MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, WE ARE VERY EXCITED, WE HAVE SIR IAN MCKELLEN, HE IS HERE TO PROMOTE JENNIFER LAWRENCE IN "THE HUNGER GAMES", WE DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. WE HAVE BEEN GONE A WEEK, OUR TOP STORY YET AGAIN TONIGHT, A UPDATE ON HEALTHCARE.GOV THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE A ONLINE MARKETPLACE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE BUT INSTEAD IT RECORDS YOU HAVING SEX AND MAILS IT TO YOUR PARENTS WITH THE TITLE CHRISTMAS SURPRISE.
WHY DOES DO IT THAT?  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS PROMISED US BY NOVEMBER 30TH THE WEB SITE WILL BE FUNCTIONAL AND AS YOU KNOW IT HAS ALREADY BEEN NOVEMBER 30TH SO THE SO.
WHITE HOUSE IS NOW WORK FOG THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO USE IT. IT CAN NOW HANDLE 50,000 USERS AT A TIME, 800,000 A DAY.
THEY SAY THEY HAVE LOWERED RESPONSE TIME TO ABOUT ONE SECOND AND THE ERROR RATE BELOW ONE PERCENT.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. THAT ONE PERCENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. OF COURSE THE DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE ONLY ERROR THAT OCCURS IS A REALLY BAD ERROR. HEY, YOU DID IT, GUYS AND TO CELEBRATE I GOT YOU A CARD, I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY IT, IT SAYS CONGRATULATIONS ON DOING THE THING YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE MONTHS AGO BEFORE WE LOST FAITH IN THE GOVERNMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
CONGRATULATIONS. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THERE STILL AREN'T PROBLEMS. MOST OF THE FRONT END MAY BE LOOKING GOOD, PEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO GET ON AND GET RESPONSES, BUT THE INFORMATION COMING OUT THE BACK END TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES IS STILL GARBAGE.
I AM STARTING TO FEEL BAD FOR THEM. BECAUSE MY GUESS IS THAT YOU FOLKS, LIKE MYSELF, THE FIRST THING YOU THOUGHT OF AS YOU WATCHED THAT WAS, HEY, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE DESCRIBING THE FROTHING RECTAL JUICE. FOR WHICH YOU ARE -- WE WILL HAVE TO WATCH THESE WORDS NO WATER, NO MATTER WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. HE CAN'T DESCRIBE A WEB SITE AS HAVING GARBAGE OUT THE BACK END, IT IS LIKE ORDERING CAPPUCCINO WITH EXTRA FORM, CAN I HAVE A COFFEE WITH THE MILKY BUBBLE?  YOU KNOW WHAT?  (BLEEP) IT, JUST GIVE ME SOME TEA.
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS THERE ARE STILL SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE OBAMA WEB SITE AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT GOING AWAY WHICH IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT CAPABLE OF RUNNING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, BUT WE SHOULD ROOT FOR IS PRIVATE, SAFER OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY TO MAKE HEALTH INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE.
Jon:.
FORGET ABOUT OBAMACARE IF WE CAN LET THE PRIVATE SECTOR RUN RAMPANT IN MEDICAL CARE, MY GOSH, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BUY THE EQUIVALENT OF AN IPHONE LIKE YOU CAN NOW FOR $29.
Jon: WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR PHONE?  I AM SURE THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET THE IPHONE EQUIVALENT FOR 29 BUCKS IF YOU GO TO CHINA TOWN AND SNATCH UP A SNAPPLE Y PHONE, WHICH YOU CAN USE TO PLAY ALL THE TOP GAMES, YOUR IRRITATED BIRDS, YOUR CANDY CRUNCH, IT IS NOT EVEN CANDY, THAT IS LO ZENK.
MY PERSONAL, LOZENGE.
MY FAVORITE, ROOT NINJA.
IT CATCHES THE EXCITEMENT OF PACKING AWAY AT A ROOT, BECAUSE THEY ARE HARDER TO -- CUT.
IF YOU WANT TO EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE A PRODUCT TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AT ONCE, THE RIGHT THING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS THE ONLY WAY, GOVERNMENT CAN'T GET IT DONE, DIDN'T WE SEE AN EXAMPLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR AT WORK JUST THIS PAST WEEK.
PULL OUT YOUR CREDIT CARDS BLACK FRIDAY IS HERE.
BLACK FRIDAY'S BEDLAM.
AN UGLY SCENE, FRENZY SHOPPING LED TO FIST FIGHTS.
SLUGGING OUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AISLES.
BRUISES.
ONE PULLING OUT A TASER SO YOU CAN HEAR THE CRACKLE OF THE STUN GUN.
Jon: YEAH, THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS.
REMIND US HOW WE LIKE TO GATHER WITH OUR LOVED ONES AROUND THE CRACKLE OF A STUN GUN. MY NUTS ROASTING ON THE -- FLOOR OF THE COSTCO. DOGS RIPPING AT MY FACE.
BUT THE DEAL I GOT ON THESE SET OF PATENT PATENTS.
PANTS WORTH IT.
THAT IS MEAN SPIRITED.
IN TEXAS TEMPERS FRAYED, UNLEASHED ON THE SHOPPERS.
Jon: WELL, THAT IS TEXAS. THEY PUT THAT OUT ON EVERYTHING.
IN VIRGINIA, POLICE SAY THERE WAS A STABBING.
Jon: WELL, THAT IS VIRGINIA, YOU KNOW, VIRGINIA IS FOR STABBERS. ALL RIGHT, SO MAYBE BLACK FRIDAY WASN'T THE BEST FOR CUSTOMERS BUT TO BE FAIR, THE WORKERS HAD IT WORSE.
IN LOCATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WORKERS PROTESTED AGAINST THE EXPANDED HOLIDAY HOURS, WAL-MART WAS A PARTICULAR TARGET. SOME EMPLOYEES OF AMERICA'S LARGEST CIVILIAN EMPLOYER PICKETED OUTSIDE IN ONTARIO CANADA, A MAN DRESSED AS SANTA CLAUS WAS PART OF THE PROTEST.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, HOW BAD DOES YOUR ORGANIZATION HAVE TO BE FOR SANTA TO PROTEST YOUR LABOR CONDITIONS, THE MAN RUNS AN ELF SWEATSHOP.
THE GUY IS WORKING ALL HOURS AND GOD FORBID YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE TOYS ANYMORE, YOU WANT TO BE A DENTIST. OH, NO!  CAN'T DO THAT. CAN'T BE A DENTIST. GOT TO MAKE TOYS.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU WERE THINKING YOU CAN SKIP ALL OF THAT BY STAYING HOME AND SHOPPING AT WAL-MART.COM, SEA AGAIN.
SO MUCH TRAFFIC ITS WEB SITE TEMPORARILY CRASHED.
Jon: BUT ITS WEB SITE IS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. SO BASICALLY, WAL-MART SPENT MONTHS WHIPPING CONSUMERS INTO VIOLENT FRENZIES AND SUBJECTED THE WORKERS TO THE FRENZIES DURING A HOLIDAY ALL WHILE THEIR WEB SITE BURNED TO THE GROUND. I AM CURIOUS, WHAT DOES THE PRIVATE SECTOR CALL THIS KIND OF DEBACLE?
WAL-MART IS CALLING IT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BLACK FRIDAY IN ITS HISTORY.
Jon: SO THE WEB SITE CRASHES IS TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE HEALTHCARE IS A NATIONAL TRAVESTY BUT IF WAL-MART'S CRASHES WHILE PEOPLE ARE DISEMBOWELLING TO GET SKY FALL ON BLU-RAY -- BUT, HEY IF THE ONLY METRIC THAT MEASURES SUCCESS THERE IS ONE THING ABOUT OBAMACARE CONSERVATIVES CAN APPRECIATE.
WITHIN A FEW YEARS BIG HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO GET AN EXTRA $220 BILLION A YEAR IN REVENUE, THANKS TO OBAMACARE.
Jon: WOOHOO, AND THE BEST PART IS, NO ONE GETS TASERED.
ONCE THEY FIX THAT PART OF THE WEB SITE.
