Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE 42nd PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HIS ANNUAL CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE MEETING NOW IN IT'S 10th YEAR KICKS OFF THIS SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 21. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIR! HOW ARE YA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIR! HOW ARE YA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, AND I'M GOING TO SAY THIS, AND IT'S NICE YOU'RE HERE TO WITNESS IT. I LIVE THIS EVERY DAY. JUST THE OVATIONS -- YOU'RE GOOD, TOO, BUT -- THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER)
I DO THIS WHEN I SEE YOU AT HOME. I'M ALL ALONE, JUST CLAPPING AND --
Jon: OH, STOP! STOP! LOOK AT YOU NOW.
WE JUST CAN'T HELP OURSELVES.
Jon: EXACTLY. TEN YEARS OF CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE. SO YOU HAVE THIS THING ALL PLANNED OUT. YOU'VE GOT THESE TREMENDOUS SPEAKERS, ALL YOUR THINGS IN ORDER. SOMETHING LIKE THIS EBOLA EPIDEMIC JUMPS UP -- IT PROBABLY REPRESENTS THE CONFLUENCE OF ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AT CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE. HOW AGILE CAN YOU BE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT ARISES AND CAN YOU ADDRESS IT EVEN AT THIS YEAR'S CONFERENCE?
YEAH, WE ARE.
HOW?
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE U.N. AND THE DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, PARTNERS IN HEALTH, ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT IT. THE UNITED STATES HAS DONE A LOT. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GOTTEN SOME MONEY THROUGH CONGRESS AND THE PENTAGON'S COMMITTED A GOOD BIT OF MONEY AND RESOURCES. LOOK, THIS IS AN EMERGENCY BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO CURE THIS.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE KNOW THAT ALMOST 5,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED. WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN 2,600 HAVE DIED. ALMOST CERTAINLY MORE THAN THAT HAVE BEEN INFECTED. THE PROBLEM IS, AS COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS OUTBREAKS OF EBOLA, WHICH ARE IN THE REMOTE  RURAL AREAS, THIS IS HIT IN SOME URBAN AREAS, AND WHEN IT GOT INTO NIGERIA AND THE CONGO, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THERE ARE JUST SO MANY BODIES BRUSHING UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER EVERY DAY, IT INCREASES THE RISK. YOU HAVE TO ISOLATE AND CARE FOR. A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE CAN SURVIVE IF THEY GET PROPER CARE QUICKLY AND WE CAN STOP THE EPIDEMIC AND LET IT BURN ITSELF OUT IF WE CAN ISOLATE EVERYBODY THAT'S INFECTED BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A HURCULEAN EFFORT.
Jon: RIGHT. IS THE IDEA TO, SINCE YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND, YOU KNOW, IF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCAL AND PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES DOWN THERE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS TRUST. THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE VERY FRIGHTENED BY THIS, JUSTIFIABLY SO.
THEY SHOULD BE.
Jon: AND THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY TRUST OUTSIDERS COMING IN, THE UNITED STATES COMING IN. HOW IS IT THAT, CAN YOUR ORGANIZATION BUILD THROUGH THOSE MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND BUILD THE TRUST YOU'RE GOING TO NEED?
WELL, WE CAN IN LIBERIA WHERE WE'RE VERY ACTIVE...
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND HAVE BEEN THERE, YOU KNOW, FROM THE BEGINNING OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S TENURE. BUT IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH MINISTRIES, THEY'LL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE WHICH IS WHY IT'S ENCOURAGING TO ME THAT WE MAY HAVE AN AFRICAN COORDINATOR.
Jon: RIGHT.
WHO WILL HAVE, I THINK, A LOT OF CREDIBILITY WORKING WITH THE OVERALL U.N. COORDINATOR AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND EVERYBODY ELSE. I THINK, BY AND LARGE, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS DESERVES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CREDIT.
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK AND PUT EVERYTHING INTO IT. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE THERE TO SERVE, AND NOW THAT PARTNERS IN HEALTH IS GOING IN, THE PARTNERS IN HEALTH IS MY PARTNER IN AFRICA AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN AFRICA AND THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD NAME. WE'RE GOING TO, I THINK, SEE A BIG RAMP UP, AND I THINK, IN LIBERIA, I SAW A NEWS STORY WHICH JUST INTERVIEWED PEOPLE ON THE STREET...
Jon: RIGHT.
WHO WERE REALLY THRILLED THAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY WERE GOING TO INVEST IN DOING THIS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN AFRICA WITH THE MILITARY SINCE I WAS PRESIDENT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THERE'S AN AFRICA COMMAND NOW AND THEY'RE VERY WELL ORGANIZED. I EXPECT THIS TO GET BETTER...
Jon: RIGHT. THE AFRICA COMMAND, THAT'S, WHAT, THAT'S, HOW OLD IS THAT, 20 YEARS? IS THAT?
WELL, WE FIRST OF ALL ORGANIZED THE TRAINING PROGRAM IN WEST AFRICA AND THEN, AFTER I LEFT OFFICE, THEY TURNED IT INTO A SEPARATE COMMAND. SO THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ABOUT 17 YEARS, I THINK.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. UNBELIEVABLE. WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE PAYING OFF IN THE FUTURE. WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT ARE BROKEN. >>LET'S DO IT.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
