(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACTOR WHOSE NEW FILM IS CALLED "50/50."
HOW'S IT GOING? 6-
GREAT. UM... YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO? FASTER.
FASTER?
FASTER. IT'S YOUR HOOK, MAN. IT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
LIKE HELLO, I HAVE CANCER?
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT AND SETS YOU APART.
OKAY, OKAY. LET'S TRY IT.
GREAT SONG.
TOTALLY.
I HAVE CANCER.
I WAS WRONG, I WAS WRONG. THAT WASN'T COOL.
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW SETH ROGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jon: I DID NOT REALIZE YOU ARE PLAYING THE BEST FRIEND IN A  MOVIE, THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS THAT THIS REALLY HAPPENED TO.
YEAH, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS WILL WHO I MET WRITING FOR THE ALI G. SHOW. HE WAS A PRODUCER, HE, LIKE, BOOKED THE GUESTS. HE LIED TO JAMES LIPTON ALL DAY. (LAUGHTER) WHICH IS STRESSFUL. SO....
Jon: YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT.
WE'VE ALL LIED TO JAMES LIPTON ONCE OR TWICE. HE ALWAYS LOOKED REALLY RUN DOWN, WE ASSUMED FROM THE STRESS OF LYING TO JAMES LIPTON ALL DAY  AND WE WOULD MAKE FUN OF HIM A LOT DUE TO HOW RUN DOWN HE LOOKED AND WE ALL DEALT WITH IT  BETTER, WE THOUGHT, AND WE WERE OF A TOUGHER CONSTITUTION AND A FEW MONTHS LATER WE FOUND OUT HE  HAD A MASSIVE TUMOR IN HIS SPINE WHICH MADE US FEEL LIKE DICKS, A AND... (LAUGHTER) AND ALSO WE FELT TERRIBLE FOR HIM, OBVIOUSLY. AND THEN HE GOT BETTER AND WE REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO MOVIE THAT REALLY FELT LIKE WHAT WE  WENT THROUGH BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T LOSE HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND HE KEPT TRYING TO GET WITH GIRLS AND HE KEPT GOING TO  BARS AND HE KEPT WORKING SO, LIKE, HE WAS JUST KIND OF TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WH THE BUCKET LIST AND OTHER MOVIES  WHERE THEY DO A BUNCH OF FUN (BLEEP) AND THEN DIE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT FILM.
IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. NOT TO SAY "THE BUCKET LIST" WAS BAD. BUT IT WASN'T WHAT WE EXPERIENCE.
Jon: DID HE TAKE ANY BREAK TO HAVE THE TUMOR IN HIS SPINE REMOVED? WAS THERE ANY SLOWDOWN IN HIS DATING? (LAUGHTER)
NOT REALLY. HONESTLY, HE COMPLAINED MORE ABOUT, LIKE, WOMEN AND RELATIONSHIPS WHEN HE HAD CANCER  THAN HE DID WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE CANCER. HE WOULD BARELY TALK ABOUT THE TUMOR AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT NO WITHIN WANTED  TO, YOU KNOW, SEAL THE DEAL WITH HIM AT TIMES. AS MOST YOUNG MEN COMPLAIN ABOUT. DOCTORS SAY THEY DID AND I'M SURE IT GARNERED HIM ATTENTION FAVORABLY AS WE DEMONSTRATE IN  THE FILM.
Jon: HOW DID THIS... SO WILL WROTE THIS FILM?
YES.
Jon: WAS IT HARD FOR YOU GUYS TO WORK OUT WHAT... WHERE THERE  THINGS SORT OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU MAYBE BASED ON YOU RIDICULING HIS  LOOKING TIRED EARLY ON? THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT TOGETHER AS THE SCRIPT WAS BEING PUT TOGETHER?
IT DEFINITELY FORCED US TO HAVE AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS THAT WE TRIED TO AVOID FOR YEARS AND  YEARS AND YEARS ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECTED OF ONE ANOTHER AND HOW WE KIND OF LET EACH OTHER DOWN  AT TIMES AND HOW WE BELIEVE MAYBE INSENSITIVE AND INARTICULATE AND LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS.
Jon: WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
WE'D KEEP SAYING THAT! SO WE TRIED TO PUT AS MUCH OF THAT IN THE MOVIE AS POSSIBLE, HONESTLY.
Jon: AND NOW IS WILL FOR INTENTS AND PURPOSES...
THE HEALTHIEST PERSON I KNOW. MUCH HEALTHIER THAN ME, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. A THOUSAND TIMES OVER.
Jon: NOW HE RIDICULES YOU FOR NOT LOOKING HEALTHY.
HE'S LIKE "DIDN'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM WHAT I WENT THROUGH? " AS I'M SMOKING A HAMBURGER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NICE! I THINK THAT'S NICE!
Jon: JUST FOR THE RECORD, SMART AND FUNNY KID. WE TRIED TO HIRE HIM LIKE FOUR TIMES ON THIS SHOW AND EVERY TIME HE KEPT BLOWING US OFF AND  ONE TIME HE DID SAY "I CAN'T, I HAVE CANCER." AND WE WERE LIKE, LOOK, IF YOU  DON'T WANT TO WORK HERE, JUST (BLEEP)ING SAY IT. (LAUGHTER) BUT LATER WE FOUND OUT THAT THAT WAS THE CASE.
IT WORKS FOR EVERYTHING, THAT EXCUSE, THOUGH. IT IS A GOOD EXCUSE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SPEAKING OF EXCUSES, SO I'M TAKING SOME QUESTIONS EARLY ON. A LADY SAYS TO ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR ROSH HASHANAH, EARLIER ON. (LAUGHTER) AND I TOLD HER NOTHING AND SHE REALLY DID SEEM DISAPPOINTED IN ME. THIS MOVIE OPENS ON ROSH HASHANAH. ARE OTHER PEOPLE'S JEWISH MOTHERS GIVING YOU A PROBLEM FOR THAT? (LAUGHTER) ARE YOU BUMMED OUT AT HIM FOR THIS? (LAUGHTER)
I JUST FELT A WAVE OF GUILT FLOOD OVER ME. IT'S IN THE EITHER NOW. YEAH, PROBABLY... I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING FOR ROSH HASHANAH.
Jon: I FELT LIKE SHE WAS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SOME, LIKE, WEIRD METAHA DOCTOR-ASSISTED SUICIDE A CLUB.
EXACTLY!
IT'S LIKE THAT FOOD RATING SYSTEM FOR JEWISH PEOPLE. WE JUST WEAR LETTERS.
SHE DID THE THING I SAID "I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING."  AND SHE DID ONE OF THESE, "HMM."
"HMM." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?
HOW WOULD YOUR ANCESTORS FEEL? THE ONES WHO WERE SLAVES? (LAUGHTER)
WE'RE DOING OUR BEST! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS THING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: FOR YOU GUYS, THE IN TOUCHNESS WITH YOUR FEELINGS YOU  LAID OUT ON THE SCREEN, IT'S JUST TREMENDOUS.
I'M GLAD IT WENT WELL BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HUMILIATING  IF WE DID A CANCER COMEDY THAT REALLY SUCKED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS, I WISH YOU THE BEST.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
Jon: "50/50" IS
