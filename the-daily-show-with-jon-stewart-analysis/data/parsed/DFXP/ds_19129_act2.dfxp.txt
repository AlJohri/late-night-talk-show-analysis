Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, FAR LONG TIME NOW, WE FOUND OUT OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE SPIED ON US, TAPPING OUR PHONES, SEARCHING OUR E-MAIL, WATCHING US WHILE WE BATHE. YES, WHILE WE BATHE! WELL, GUESS WHAT, IT'S PAYBACK TIME.
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT TROUBLE AT THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.
THANKS TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT, WE NOW HAVE ACCESS TO ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION THAT OTHERWISE WE PROBABLY NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE SPIERS HAVE BECOME THE SPY-EES. C.I.A., THIS IS GOING TO BE JUICY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT, GERMAN ESPIONAGE, POISONING THE RUSSIANS? WHAT DO WE GOT?
THE WEB SITE MUCKROCK FILED AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT REQUEST TO SEE THE C.I.A. STAFFERS' COMMENTS ABOUT THE LUNCHROOM IN LANGLEY, VIRGINIA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: [BLEEPED]. YES, APPARENTLY CAFETERIA COMPLAINTS ARE WHAT WE FOUND OUT. APPARENTLY WHEN OUR INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS AREN'T SENDING DRONES AFTER TERRORISTS, THEY'RE SENDING BITCHY E-MAILS ABOUT THEIR LUNCH. THE E-MAILS WERE EVERYTHING FROM PREFERRING INDIVIDUAL KETCHUP PACKETS TO THE PUMP BOXES TO INADEQUATE ALMOND PORTIONS AT THE BREAKFAST CEREAL BAR TO DIET PEPSI COMING OUT OF THE REGULAR PEPSI SPOUT. FASCINATING. APPARENTLY AT THE C.I.A., EVEN THE SODAS GO UNDERCOVER AS OTHER SODAS. ESPIONAGE.  NOW, WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TONIGHT. WE HAVE A C.I.A. EMPLOYEE WHO IS READY TO LEAK MORE INFORMATION TO US ABOUT THIS SCANDAL. OBVIOUSLY, ANYTHING REGARDING THIS C.I.A. HIGHLY SENSITIVE. WE HAVE TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO CONCEAL HIS OR HER IDENTITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, SIR OR MA'AM.
UH-HUH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IF YOU DON'T MIND, COULD YOU READ US SOME MORE OF THESE ACTUAL COMPLAINT E-MAILS FROM THE C.I.A.
OKAY. WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW, I WAS VERY AGGREVATED AT BUYING A SUBWAY SANDWICH AND GOING BACK TO MY DESK TO EAT TO FIND THE BREAD STALE AND CRUNCHY HARD. I HAD TO EAT THE INSIDE AND THROW THE BREAD OUT.
Jon: I'M SORRY. OBVIOUSLY WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THIS RISK, SIR. ARE YOU SURE WE'RE DOING ENOUGH TO CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY, BECAUSE THIS IS...
WHAT? MY FACE IS HIDDEN. SILHOUETTE. I COULD BE ANYBODY. WHERE WAS I? NOW, WHY DOESN'T THE BURGER KING FACILITY HERE OFFER THE SAME DOLLAR MENU AS THE OUTSIDE FACILITIES? WHY CAN'T THERE BE NICER FOOD HANDLERS? I MEAN, WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THAT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO, NOW ALRIGHT. NOT TO, NOT TO HARP ON THIS POINT. I AM CONCERNED, SIR. YOUR VOICE IS SOMEWHAT DISTINCTIVE, AND THAT LAST PART THAT YOU JUST SAID SOUNDED A BIT LIKE A CATCHPHRASE. I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WAS IN THE E-MAIL.
DISTINCTIVE, NO, NORMAL VOICE. YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY SOMEONE JUST BY THEIR VOICE. WHY DO YOU THINK WHEN YOU CALL SOMEONE, YOU SAY HI, IT'S SO AND SO. OTHERWISE THEY'D HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY WERE TALKING TO. THE WORST IS WHEN SOMEONE CALLS AND SAY, "HEY, IT'S ME. WHO'S ME? I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE NAMED ME. I'M ME. YOU'RE SOMEBODY ELSE."
Jon: NO, SEE THAT? THIS ALL SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE, I DON'T --
NOT NOW!
GIDDY-UP.
Jon: LOOK I THINK I, I, SIR, YOUR COVER IS... I THINK WE MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY COMPROMISED YOUR COVER, SIR.
WHAT COVER? I'M COVERED. COVER YOURSELF. THE JAZZ SALAD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SONOMA GRAPE AND PROSCIUTTO SALAD, SO I STAND IN LINE AND NOTICE THERE ARE NO GRAPES. GRAPES ARE IN THE TITLE OF THE SALAD.
Jon: LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT A JAZZ SALAD IS.
IT'S LIKE A REGULAR SALAD BUT JAZZIER. HOW MUCH CLEARER COULD THAT BE?
Jon: I THINK YOU'RE IN A LOT OF DANGER RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TELL YOU WHO IS IN DANGER, THESE PEOPLE EATING NOTHING BUT BURGER KING, SUBWAY AND SALADS FILLED WITH JAZZ. I MEAN, WHO ARE...
Jon: THESE PEOPLE?
YES. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOFTER SUBWAY BREAD. THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR A TREADMILL. THEIR SPIES. IF INCONSPICUOUS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR, MAYBE WHEEZING IS NOT THE BEST TACTIC.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK WE'RE OUT OF TIME. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY, SIR. AND, I KNOW YOU PUT YOURSELF IN TREMENDOUS DANGER TO DO THIS. AND IT'S THE TYPE OF THING THAT...
SHOULD I STAY BEHIND THE THING? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS ANYMORE. JUST GO. I'LL BRING YOU OUT DURING THE GUEST SEGMENT. IT'S FINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IT'S FINE. JUST GO.
