APRIL 5TH, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS  JON STEWART, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. MY GUESTS TONIGHT, CHEF, AUTHOR AND TV HOST ANTHONY BOURDAIN. HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE PROGRAM TELLING US ALL ABOUT THE NEW PLACES AND CUISINES  THAT HE HAS BEEN ENJOYING AROUND THE WORLD. AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN A DEBATE RAGING IN RECENT AREAS IN THIS COUNTRY  OVER THE APPROPRIATE SIZE OF OUR GOVERNMENT AND WHETHER IT CAN BE ENTRUSTED WITH SO  MUCH OF OUR MONEY. EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF THE COMPLAINING OVER BIG WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT  SPENDING IS EVERBLOWN, TONIGHT WE HAVE A STORY THAT MIGHT MAKE YOU RECONSIDER, PERHAPS EVEN INVEST IN SOME POSTER BOARD AND A TRICORNERED HAT OF YOUR OWN.
LAS VEGAS IS NO STRANGER TO WILD SPENDING SPREES. BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN AT A GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE. ON THE TAXPAYERS' DIME.
Jon: UNLESS IT IS THE GOVERNMENT OF PARTY-- IN WHICH CASE THAT IS EXACTLY  WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT, PRESIDENT BOOMER? (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S THE DAMAGE?
TWO STORY SUITES THAT NORMALLY GO FOR $22 PER NIGHT.
$75,000 IN A TRAINING EXERCISE THAT PUT BIKES TOGETHER.
MORE THAN $100,000 JUST TO PLAN A FOUR-DAY LAS VEGAS CONFERENCE.
SOME OF THAT MONEY WENT FOR CLOWNS, AND A MINDREADER.
MORE THAN $6,000 ON WHAT IS BASICALLY SWAG. CANTEENS, KEY CHAINS, T-SHIRTS.
A FINAL HEAD-SPINNING PRICE TAG $8127-- $823,000.
Jon: NOT ONLY DID THE GOVERNMENT BLOW ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS OF OUR MONEY  IN VEGAS, THEY BLEW IT ON LAME [BLEEP] CANTEENS? CLOWNS AND BICYCLES? YOU'RE IN VEGAS. UNLESS THOSE CANTEENS ARE FILLED WITH COCAINE AND BICYCLE IS A GOVERNMENT  ACRONYM FOR JAPANESE [BLEEP] SWING, YOU-- YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO CORRUPTION EVERYWHERE. (LAUGHTER) I THINK I AM LESS UP SET ABOUT THE WASTE OF MONEY THAN MI WITH THE WASTE OF OPPORTUNITY. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO WASTE A MILLION DOLLARS IN VEGAS. YEAH, YOU MR. PETERS IN ROOM 413, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TIGER AND A PENGUIN [BLEEP] YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. AND I GOT ANY LEFT OVER SEND UP TWO BOTTLES OF EVIAN. YOU'RE WELCOME. ALL RIGHT. SO A GIANT AND EXTREME WASTE OF GOVERNMENT MONEY FOR A CONFERENCE. TALK ABOUT SCAN BALANCES. BUT DOES THIS EVENT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF OH FOR GOOD'S SAKES. IT DOES.
THE LAVISH LAS VEGAS CONFERENCE ORGANIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GENERAL  SERVICE ITS ADMINISTRATION, THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION IS THE GOVERNMENT'S LANDLORD AND PROCUREMENT MANAGER. IT IS SUPPOSED TO SET THE STANDARD FOR EFFICIENCY AND COST-CUTTING.
Jon: IRONY. THE PEOPLE HOLDING THE CONFERENCE THAT WASTED A TON OF GOVERNMENT MONEY ARE THE  PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WASTE A TON OF MONEY. LIKE THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL HOLDING A CONFERENCE IN ANDY DICKEY JACUZZI. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SELLING GUNS TO MEXICAN DRUG DEALERS. WHAT? THEY-- THEY DID? YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! OH, IT GETS BETTER. EVEN BETTER THAN THE SCANDAL OF SPENDING $800,000 ON A CONFERENCE, EVEN BETTER THAN  SPENDING $800,000 ON A CONFERENCE WHEN ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF PREVENTING OVERSPENDING IS THIS.
THEY GOT $80,000 SPENT JUST ON AREA BOOKS FOR THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS. THEY GOT MOMENTOS.
Jon: YEARBOOKS! THEY GOT YEARBOOK, THE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT KNOWN FOR EFFICIENCY AND COST-CUTTING MADE SURE THEY  WOULD HAVE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF THE BOONDOGGLE THEY HAD IN VEGAS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PICTURE OF THE AGENCY'S DIRECTOR FROM THE YEARBOOK. OH YEAH LOOK, SHE WAS VOTED MOST LAKELY TO RESIGN OVER THIS COMICAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE  AGENCY'S MISSION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BY NOW YOU ARE PROBABLY SAYING OH, RIGHT, IT'S BOONDOGGLE OF EPIC AND  IRONIC PROPORTIONS, BUT IS THERE ONE SINGLE EXPENDITURE THAT IN AND OF ITSELF ISN'T  EXORBITANT BUT IS STILL ABLE TO CAPTURE THE DISTILLED ESENCE OF HUBRIS AND INCOMPETENCE THAT WAS ON  DISPLAY HERE.
MORE THAN $6300 FOR COMMEMORATIVE COINS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: 6,300 OF OUR MONEY TO MAKE FAKE MONEY COME MEM RATING THE WEEKEND THEY ALL  WASTED OUR MONEY. ALL TOLD, THIS SCANDAL HAS CREATED THAT RAREST OF THINGS, A TRULY JUSTIFIABLE MEDIA FIRESTORM. COMMENTATORS EVERYWHERE HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY WITH THIS THING, PARTICULARLY AT FOX NEWS. AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS, YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS ONE IS TOTALLY LEGITIMATE TO GO AFTER. WELL DONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: STILL THOUGH, I WAS SURPRISED BY THE DEGREE OF INTENSITY WITH WHICH ONE FOX  COMMENTATOR HAS SEIZED ON ONE PARTICULAR DETAIL.
$4 PER SHRIMP AT A COCKTAIL RECEPTION, FOUR BUCKS. AT SHOPRIGHT, ONE SHRIMP WILL COST YOU 27 CENTS. I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN VEGAS. SHRIMP ARE MARKED UP 1,381 PERCENT. NOW I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE IN MY LIFE AND CAN BUY PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER I WANT. BUT STILL WHEN I WALK THAT A PLACE AND SEE AN OUTRAGE US PRICE TAG I WALK AWAY. IT'S MY UPBRING. I'M TO THE GOING TO PAY 4 BUCKS FOR A SHRIMP, EVER! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I WOULD RATHER STRANGLE A [BLEEP] PELICAN AND PULL A BEAK FULL OF  SHRIMP OUT AND EAT THEM FOR FREE THEN PAY FOR-- ACTUALLY, WHILE SOME MIGHT HEAR THAT AS A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES, I SEE IT AS SOMETHING MORE. I SEE IT AS A CHALLENGE. JOIN ME NOW AS WE PLAY YOU CAN MAKE BILL O REILLY PAY $4 FOR A SHRIMP. AT HOME ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS THIS, VERY SIMPLE. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS THIS ALL I INTO NEED TO PLAY THIS AT HOME IS A PLATE OF SHRIMP. FOUR $1 BILLS, OH AND WE NEED BILL O'REILLY. OH, THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE DON'T-- OH MY GOD! BILL O'REILLY? >>.
WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING ME, STEWART, I'M NOT PAYING FOUR BUCKS FOR A SHRIMP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES, BILL. THANKS FOR JOINING US. YOU KNOW HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED. LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, LISTEN HERE IS OUR FIRST SCENARIO YOU, BILL O'REILLY HAVE A  RARE MEDICAL CONDITION THAT REQUIRES THE CONSUMPTION OF AT LEAST ONE SHRIMP PER DAY. THERE ARE TWO STORES IN TOWN, ONE OF THEM PINHEADS ARE US SELLS SHRIMP FOR 27 CENTS BUT THEIR PROFIT GOES TO FUND THE ACLU. THE OTHER PATRIOTS USA SELLS SHRIMP FOR $4 A SHRIMP, BUT DONATES ALL ITS PROCEEDS TO  A SHELL TER FOR FLAGS THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED IN FIRES. (LAUGHTER) YOU NEED THE SHRIMP, O'REILLY. ONE ONE DO YOU BUY.
I'M NOT EATING THE SHRIMP, I'M NOT BUYING THE SHRIMP, I WILL GIVE A DONATION FOR BILL O'REILLY.COM TO THE  FLAG PEOPLE. NO SHRIMP RZ ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU PAY $4 FOR A SHRIMP IF IT WERE WRAPPED  IN A $10 BILL NETTING YOU A PROFIT OF $6?
I WOULD STEAL THE $4 SHRIMP, AND THEN DONATE IT TO THE OCCUPY WALL STREET  FOLKS SO THEY KNOW WHAT THE 1%ERS EAT.
Jon: TRY THIS ONE.
I DON'T BUY IT.
Jon: ALIENS HAVE INVADED EARTH, AND HAVE USED SOME KIND OF SHRIMPIFYING RAY. TURNING ALL OUR FOOD INTO SHRIMP AND AGAINST ALL ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES INSTEAD  OF CAUSING THE PRICE TO PLUMB AT THE TIME SOMEHOW RAISES THE PRICE-- TO $4 AND  YOU DISCOVER THERE IS AN EXHAUST PORT IN THEIR SPACE SHEEP THAT YOU CAN USE TO BLOW IT UP. THE PORT IS THE SAME EXACT SIZE AND SHAPE OF A SHRIMP, WOULD YOU BUY A $4 SHRIMP TO THROW INTO THE EXHAUST PORT AND SAVE THE PLANET.
NO. (LAUGHTER)
ANY THAT ALLOWS $4 SHRIMP, NOT WORTH SAVING.
Jon: THAT IS THE BENCHMARK. LAST ONE. A MAN COMES TO YOU WITH A TIME MACHINE. THE INFORMATION THAT HE HAS IS THAT HITLER IS ALLERGIC TO SHRIMP. ONLY $4 SHRIMP-- THAT'S THE BUZZER, I HAVE LOST. BILL O'REILLY HAS HELD STRONG IN HIS REFUSAL TO PAY $4 FOR SHRIMP. I SALUTE YOU, SIR.
I CAN'T BELIEVE AWE KNOWED ME WITH THIS.
Jon: WHAT?
I CAN'T BELIEVE AWE KNOWED ME WITH THIS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: APOLOGIZE T WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, SIR. YOUR PRIZE WILL BE COMING TO YOU. A $1,000 PAID IN THE FORM OF $250 SHRIMP-- 250 SHRIMP.
STEWART, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR SHRIMP.
Jon: FINE, ALL RIGHT. BILL O'REILLY, EVERYBOD
