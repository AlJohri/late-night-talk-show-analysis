[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO WHILE THIS COUNTRY DIGS OUT FROM RECORD SNOWS AND COLD, OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH IN WHAT THEY CALL CANADA ARE BATTLING TROUBLES OF THEIR OWN.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THINGS KEEP GETTING WORSE FOR TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD.
Jon: BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY ARE GETTING WORSE? BELIEVE IT OR NOT? I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING MORE BELIEVABLE IN MY LIFE. IT WOULD BE MORE SURPRISING TO HEAR BELIEVE IT NOT ROB FORD IS INTRODUCING A NEW FRAGRANCE OR BELIEVE IT OR NOT I READ AN INTERESTING PIECE IN THE NEW YORKER BY ROB FORD OR BELIEVE IT OR NOT WHEN I GO AWAY, I HAVE ROB FORD WATCH MY CHILDREN. WHAT DID SIR SMOKES A LOT OF CRACK DO NOW?
THE CRACK SMOKER SUED FOR ALLEGEDLY HAVING HIS SISTER'S EXBOYFRIEND BEATEN UP IN PRISON.
Jon: WELL, THEY SOUND LIKE A LOVELY FAMILY. [LAUGHTER] BEATEN UP IN PRISON? WHAT IS ROB FORD TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE CELLBLOCK BEFORE HIS INEVITABLE ARRIVAL. SURPRISING FORESIGHT FROM THE MAN THE CANADIAN MEDIA HAS OFFICIALLY DUBBED CRACK MAYOR ROB FORD. WHAT POSSIBLE REASON DID HE HAVE TO WANT HIS SISTER'S EXBOYFRIEND TO BE BEATEN UP IN PRISON.
ACCORDING TO THE SUIT TO KEEP HIM QUIET ABOUT FORD'S ABUSE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.
Jon: YES, IF NOT FOR HIM HOW WOULD WE EVER HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HIS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE? HE HAS DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB ON KEEPING IT ON WHAT WE CALL THE DL.
YES, I HAVE SMOKED CRACK COCAINE.
MIMED ANOTHER COUNCILMAN DRIVING DRUNK. (bleep).
I WILL (bleep) (bleep) MONEY, MONEY, IT SAID I WANTED TO EAT (bleep). I NEVER SAID THAT IN MY LIFE TO HER. I'M HAPPILY MARRIED. I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO EAT AT HOME. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO FIND OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE SUBSTANCE ISSUES. HEY IT'S ROB FORD YOU EXPECT THIS SORT OF THING FROM HIM.
POP STAR JUSTIN BIEBER IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT IN CANADA. BIEBER IS ACCUSED OF BEATING A LIMO DRIVER IN THE HEAD LAST MONTH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET ME SEE IF I CAN REENACT THAT SCENE.

Jon: WHAT THE (bleep) IS GOING ON IN CANADA.
BAD BOYS OF CANADA, JUSTIN BIEBER AND ROB FORD.
TALKING ABOUT JUSTIN BIEBER SCANDAL.
WE LOVE FORD A LITTLE BIT.
YOU HAVE ROB FORD AND JUSTIN BIEBER IN THE SAME TOWN. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO MANAGE THAT? â™ª
Jon: IT'S A LITTLE JOKE. THEY ARE JUST A COUPLE OF PLAYFUL SCAMPS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING MAJOR FELONIES. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SAID THINGS LOUDLY IN A POST GAME CELEBRATORY INTERVIEW.
ACCORDING TO DEADSPIN THE DAY AFTER SHERMAN'S INTERVIEW THE WORD THUG WAS USED 625 TIMES ON TELEVISION.
Jon: HE IS A THUG. THE THUGS ARE NOT THE DUDES ACCUSED OF ACTUAL VIOLENT CRIMES IT'S THE STANFORD EDUCATED CORNERBACK WHO TALKED TOO LOUD. I CAN'T HELP BUT ASSUME IT'S DUE TO A DEEP SYSTEMIC BIAS AGAINST SEATTLE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
