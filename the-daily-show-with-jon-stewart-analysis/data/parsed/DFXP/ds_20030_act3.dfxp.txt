Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM SOPHIE DELAUNAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.
THANKS FOR INVITING ME.
Jon: NOW, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS HAS BEEN WORKING IN VERY, VERY DIFFICULT LANDS AND CONDITIONS FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. AND I KNOW YOU HAD MANY DOCTORS WORKING IN LIBERIA, SIERRA LEONE DURING THE EBOLA CRISIS. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EBOLA CRISIS IS NOW OVER BECAUSE AMERICANS ARE NO LONGER GETTING IT. SO, I CAN ONLY ASSUME NOW THAT ALL OF YOUR DOCTORS HAVE LEFT THE AREA AND IT IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM.
I WISH IT WAS THE CASE. ACTUALLY. AND I WISH THEY WERE ALL PLAYING BOWLING SOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE. THE OUTBREAK SHOWS NO SIGNS OF ABATING IN THE REGION. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A DOWNWARD TREND IN MONROVIA. THE CAPITOL OF LIBERIA.
Jon: YES.
THERE IS STILL A NUMBER OF NEW CASES IN THE REGION. SIERRA LEONE IS ACTUALLY A GREAT CONCERN. IT'S THE COUNTRY THAT TAKES THE HIGHEST BURDEN OF CASES AT THIS MOMENT. AND THE AID UNFORTUNATELY IS STILL INSUFFICIENT AND ILL ADAPTED TO --
Jon: IT'S IN SUFFICIENT. NOW HAVE GOVERNMENTS, NOW THE NEWS MEDIA HAS MAYBE LESS FOCUS ON IT HAVE YOU SEEN A DROP IN THE TYPE OF FUNDING THAT YOU NEED FOR THAT SORT OF THING? HAVE GOVERNMENTS ABANDONED THE EFFORT AND IT REALLY IS LEFT NOW TO JUST PURELY THE NGOS ON THE GROUND, IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. IT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE AID IS JUST NOW BEING EFFECTIVE ON THE GROUND. IT HAS TAKEN THREE MONTHS. IT'S BEEN VERY VERY SLOW TO DEPLOY. AND THE PLAN THAT WAS BUILT IN THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER IS YESTERDAY'S PLAN. AND IT DOES NOT COINCIDE TO TODAY'S NEEDS. SO NOT ONLY IS THERE STILL A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESPONSE. BUT THE RESPONSE AS IT WAS DESIGNED THREE MONTHS AGO IS NO LONGER ADAPTIVE.
Jon: RIGHT. IS NOT LONGER SUFFICIENT.
FOR EXAMPLE, AT THAT TIME THERE WAS A HUGE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL BEDS AND ISOLATION UNITS IN MONROVIA, RIGHT. IT'S NO LONGER THE CASE. THERE ARE STILL CASES IN MONROVIA BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH BEDS. WHAT IS NEEDED AT THE MOMENT IS A VERY FLEXIBLE AND AGILE AIDE SYSTEM THAT WOULD ADAPT TO THE EVOLVING NATURE  SYSTEM THAT WOULD ADAPT TO THE EVOLVING NATURE  OF THE OUTBREAK.
Jon: SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS YOU NEED MORE BEDS.
WE -- WE -- WE NEED A FEW MORE BEDS.
Jon: IT'S, IT'S --
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE CRISIS IT'S NOT JUST ONE ELEMENT OF THE RESPONSE THAT IS GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT'S THE FULL PACKAGE. YOU NEED TO HAVE ISOLATION UNITS, BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE CONTACT TRACING, SURVEILLANCE, YOU NEED TO DO EDUCATION AND SAFE BURIAL. AND IT'S THIS COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR A GOOD RESPONSE.
Jon: AND YOU ALSO, YOU SEEM TO LEARN ANY ISSUE AT ANY PART OF THE WORLD IN A WAY WE USE TO FEEL LIKE OCEANS ISOLATE US OR WESTERN IMPROVEMENTS AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ISOLATE US, THEY DON'T. AND IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS IN AREAS THEY WILL RISE UP AND CAUSE ISSUES ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S FOR SURE. VIRUSES KNOWS NO BORDERS, SO IT'S CLEAR THAT --
Jon: ISN'T IT INTERESTING HOW VIRUSES AND DOCTORS, NEITHER ONE.
YES, EXACTLY.
Jon: INTERESTING. VERY INTERESTING.
SO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT --
Jon: WHICH ONE MUTATES FASTER, THAT'S MY QUESTION. [LAUGHING] WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SOME DOCTORS HERE AND NURSES WHO -- I THINK VERY COURAGEOUSLY WENT TO THESE AREAS WITH EBOLA AND WORKED WITH PATIENTS AND CAME BACK. AND WE DECIDED THE WAY TO CELEBRATE THAT, THE WAY WE DO IT IN OUR COUNTRY IS WE SHUN THEM. WE PUT THEM IN ISOLATION. DID THAT CAUSE A CHILLING EFFECT ON YOUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT PEOPLE TO WORK?
IT DIDN'T HAVE AN EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU NEED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT IN THE LONG RUN. BUT IT CERTAINLY HAD AN IMPACT ON THE VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE AT THAT MOMENT IN THE FIELD.
Jon: OH REALLY?
AND WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO RETURN IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. SO, SOME OF THEM HAD TO CHANGE THEIR PLANS. THEY HAD TO COME BACK EARLIER BECAUSE OF THESE MEASURES WHICH OF COURSE HAS AN IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND ON THE GROUND.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY IT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL STIGMA ON THE PEOPLE AND BY JUST EXACERBATING THE FEAR ON THE PART OF THE POPULATION. CREATING A FALSE SENSE THAT THESE PEOPLE CONSTITUTE A THREAT WHEN WE KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS YOU'RE NOT AT RISK OF TRANSMITTING THE VIRUS.
Jon: WHAT IS A ROTATION FOR, IF SOMEONE WANTED TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN DOCTORS WITHOUT BOARDERS. WHAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL STINT? IS IT SOMETHING PEOPLE DO IN A WEEK? IS IT A TWO MONTH ROTATION, IS IT SIX MONTHS? WHAT'S THE PLAN.
YEAH. WELL, USUALLY IT'S BETWEEN NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR.
Jon: OH, SO THIS IS, YOU MUST MAKE A HUGE COMMITMENT.
BUT FOR THE EBOLA -- FOR THE EBOLA OUTBREAK IT'S VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE DEMANDING NATURE OF THE WORK. IT'S SO STRESSFUL, IT'S SO HIGH RISK.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND ALSO IT REQUIRES SUCH SPECIFIC SKILLS. WE MANAGE ROTATIONS EVERY FIVE TO SIX WEEKS FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL STAFF.
Jon: OH MY GOD, OKAY.
SO, IT'S A VERY DEMANDING RECRUITMENT THAT IS PUT IN PLACE. BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT ACTUALLY 90% OF THE WORK, WHICH IS THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WORK IS DONE BY OUR NATIONAL COLLEAGUES ON THE GROUND. AND THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS OUTBREAK SINCE THE MONTH OF MARCH.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO FOR THEM THERE IS NO ROTATION.
Jon: IT'S JUST THEY'RE JUST THERE AND MAKING PROGRESS. WELL, WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT. WE'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL. BUT OBVIOUSLY, THE POINT IS STILL NEED RESOURCES, STILL NEED FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT STILL HAS MUCH TO GO BEFORE IT'S --
LET'S NOT LET OUR GUARD DOWN. THAT'S FOR SURE. Jon: ALRIGHT. STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT. SOPHIE DELAUNAY.
