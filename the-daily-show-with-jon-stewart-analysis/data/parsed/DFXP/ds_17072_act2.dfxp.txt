(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. 44 YEARS AGO RICHARD NIXON WON THE WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS FAMED MIX OF CHARM AND CHARISMA AND  A THING CALLED THE SOUTHERN STRATEGY, AN APPEAL TO RACIAL FEARS TO TURN THE SOUTH AWAY  FROM DEMOCRATS THUS MAKING UP FOR NIXON'S LACK OF CHARM AND CHARISMA. EVERY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HAS NEEDED A STRATEGY TO WIN THE SOUTH. WITH THE PRIMARIES TOMORROW IN ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN WITH MITT  ROMNEY'S SOUTHERN STRATEGY AND HOW IT'S DEVELOPING.
GOOD MORNING, Y'ALL. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
Jon: YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
I GOT STARTED RIGHT WITH A BISCUIT AND SOME CHEESY GRITS. DELICIOUS.
Jon: A GUY THAT LOOKS LIKE HE JUST STEPPED OFF THE MONOPOLY BOARD. DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO APPEAL TO SOUTHERNERS BY FINDING REFERENCE WITH THEM  ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO THEM: THEIR ACCENT AND CHOOSING THE RIGHT BREAKFAST STARCH? THIS POOR GUY. FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, CONTORTING HIMSELF JUST TO WIN A FEW VOTES. IS THERE ANYTHING MORE PATHETIC SOUTHERN FRIED PANDERING THAN GRITS?
THIS PLACE ALWAYS HAS A SPECIAL FEELING IN MY HEART BECAUSE WHEN I GREW UP I WAS  THINKING ABOUT DAVEY CROCKETT. REMEMBER THE SONG BORN ON A MOUNTAIN TOP IN TENNESSEE, GREENEST STATE IN THE LAND OF THE FREE. RAISED IN THE WOODS SO HE KNEW EVERY TREE. AND HE KILLED HIMSELF A BEAR WHEN HE WAS ONLY THREE. DAVEY, DAVEY CROCKETT. REMEMBER THAT?
Jon: NO, THEY DON'T REMEMBER IT. THEY'RE NOT 60. YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY DID NAIL DOWN THE PEOPLE WHO GREW UP WITH BLACK AND WHITE TV VOTE. FORTUNATELY ROMNEY HAD A CHANCE TO USE A SLIGHTLY MORE RECENT SOUTHERN SONG REFERENCE  AT A RALLY LAST FRIDAY WITH RANDY OWEN, LEAD SINGER OF THE LEGENDARY COUNTRY BAND ALABAMA. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHICH GREATEST ALABAMA HIT IS MITT GOING TO ASK HIM TO SING? FEELS SO RIGHT. I KNOW WE HAD TO LOOK UP OTHER SONGS ON WIKIPEDIA. WHICH ONE.
SWEET HOME ALABAMA. WOULDN'T THAT BE WONDERFUL. ♪ SWEET HOME ALABAMA ♪♪ ♪ WHERE THE SKIES ARE SO BLUE ♪♪
Jon: THAT SONG IS LEONARD SKIN ARD. EVERYTHING ROMNEY KNOWS ABOUT THE SOUTH HE LEARNED FROM A JEFF FOXWORTHY ROUTINE. IF YOU HAVE A WORKING 52-INCH PLASMA TV ON TOP OF ALSO WORKING 52-INCH PLAZA MA TV, YOU MIGHT BE A ROMNEY. IF YOUR FAVORITE KIND OF FIREWORKS IS FIRING PEOPLE AT WORK... SERIOUSLY, WHERE IS  ROMNEY GETTING THIS STUFF.
JEFF FOXWORTHY JOINS US NEXT WITH THE GOVERNOR.
Jon: HOLY (BEEP).
MITT IS THE RIGHT GUY FOR THE JOB.
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF NEW MATERIAL FROM THE  FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE SINCE YOU MADE THIS ENDORSEMENT. WHAT KIND OF NEW MATERIAL?
THERE'S THE FEEDBACK.
CAN YOU REPEAT IT, JEFF?
YEAH.
NOW WE HAVE TO KEEP OURSELVES AND ALL THE VIEWERS HANGING AS TO THE FEEDBACK  THAT JEFF FOXWORTHY GOT AND THE NEW MATERIAL HE'S BEEN ABLE TO ACCRUE SINCE ENDORSING  MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO. SATELLITE TROUBLES. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS. IF YOU HAVE A CAR ON YOUR FRONT LAWN BECAUSE YOUR GARAGE ONLY HOLDS FIVE CARS, IF YOU  GO TO THE DINER AND ORDER YOUR EGGS FABERGE, IF YOU THINK CLOVERFIELD WAS A MOVIE ABOUT  YOUR BUTLER, YOU MIGHT BE A ROMNEY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
