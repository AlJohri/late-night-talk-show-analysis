( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  THAT IS THE CONVENTIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF, THE CREW, AND THE CORRESPONDENTS ON THE "DAILY SHOW."  THEY HAVE TAKEN THIS SHOW ON THEIR BACKS AND BROUGHT IT DOWN INTO TAMPA AND NORTH CAROLINA, AND TECHNICALLY, AND OTHERWISE, I THINK DONE A FLAWLESS AND AMAZING JOB. AND I'D LOVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE PEOPLE WORKING ON THE SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO OUR JOBS. I WANT TO THANK THE IMAGINE ON THEATER FOR HOSTING US ALL WEEK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). IT'S BEEN QUITE AN EXPERIENCE. I HAVE TO SAY. ANY TIME WE GET OUT OF OUR CLOISTERED LITTLE HOLE IN NEW YORK CITY AND VISIT THE DARK  HEART INTERSECTING MEDIA AND POLITICS IN PUBLISH, I CAN ASSURE YOU, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH  PURELE IN THE WORLD.   (  LAUGHTER  )  THE SILK WOOD SHOWER, THAT'S ( BLEEP ). BUT THAT BEING SAID, THE WARMTH AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE AUDIENCES THAT CAME IN HERE EVERY NIGHT TO  SEE THE SHOW LIVE AND TO GIVE US THE KIND OF ENERGY THAT WE NEEDED--    ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  VERY, VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. WE'VE ENJOYED IT. I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE PROGRAMS AS WELL. WE'LL SEE YOU BACK IN NEW YORK. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
