John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A VERY FINE  ACTRESS WHOSE NEW FILM IS CALLED  "WHITE HOUSE DOWN."
HELP IS NOT COMING. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST  SAID?
JOHN, THEY CALLED AN AIR  STRIKE ON THE WHITE HOUSE. THE VICE PRESIDENT IS DEAD. YOU JUST NEED TO GET OUT OF  THERE.
NO, NO, NO, THEY CANNOT DO  THAT.
I'M SO, SO SORRY. I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO,  JOHN. IF YOU STAY IN THERE YOU'RE  GOING TO DIE.
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME. THEY'RE COUNTING ON ME RIGHT  NOW. YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH TIME I  HAVE.
YOU ONLY HAVE EIGHT MINUTES  LEFT TO GET THEM OUT.
John: HELP US, YOU'RE OUR OWN  HOPE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW,  MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S A LOT OF GYLLENHAAL.
WELCOME. John: THAT'S RIGHT. WE CAN JUST DO THIS FOR FIVE  MINUTES. YOU CAN JUST BASQUE IN THE GLORY  OF AFFECTION.
PLEASE LET'S NOT  John: SO WHITE HOUSE DOWN. ONE OF THE CENTRAL CHARACTERS IN  THIS IS A HACKER WHO MANAGES TO  GET ON TO N.S.A. COMPUTERS AND COMPROMISE SECURITY. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE WHOLE ED  CARD SNOWDEN STORY WAS JUST A  CAMPAIGN? IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS  THE...
YOU MEAN IS IT PART OF LIKE  THE MACK TRUCK THAT IS THE PRESS  CAMPAIGN FOR WHITE HOUSE DOWN?
I WONDER IF WE EVENTUALLY  FOUND EDWARD SNOWDEN AND HE'S  WEARING A WHITE HOUSE DOWN  T-SHIRT? NEVER DOUBT THE POWER OF MAJOR  STUDIOS.
CAN I INTERRUPT YOU AND SAY  HOW NICE IT IS TO SEE YOU HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M USED TO SEEING THAT OTHER  JON
John: THE OTHER JON. THIS IS A REFRESHING CHANGE,  JUST NOT A CHANGE YOU WOULD WANT  PERMANENTLY. UNLIKE A NEW CAR SMELL WHICH IS  NICE UNTIL YOU REALIZE THAT THE  NEW CAR SMELL IS DISGUSTING.
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU A  COMPLIMENT. YOU TOOK IT AND YOU JUST KIND OF  SNUFFED IT OUT.
John: I'M BRITISH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH  COMPLIMENTS.
JUST TAKE IT  ohn: I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE  THAT. NOW WHITE HOUSE DOWN. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A BIT  OF A SHIFT IN MOVIES OVER THE  YEARS. WE LIKE TO SEE PRESIDENTS NOW  PHYSICALLY FIGHTING BACK. WHY DO YOU FIND THAT SO  REASSURING? A PRESIDENT WILL LIKE GET A GUN  AND GO, "DON'T WORRY. I'LL HANDLE THIS."
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I THINK  JAMIE TRIED TO BE THE PRESIDENT  WHO DIDN'T DO THAT. THERE'S ONE SCENE IN THE MOVIE  WHERE I REMEMBER CHANNING DOES  THIS HUGE LEAP ACROSS AN ELEVATOR SHAFT, AND THERE'S A  MOMENT... I MEAN YOU'VE PROBABLY  SAID THAT.
John: IF I KNOW THERE'S A  LEAP ACROSS AN ELEVATOR SHAFT.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS SAFE TO  GIVE AWAY. THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE THE  PRESIDENT'S LAWYER PRETENDS  THAT'S HARD FOR HIM BUT I THINK HE COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. HE ALSO WANTED TO BE THE ONE  WITH THE GUNS AND SAVING PEOPLE.
John: DEEP DOWN AMERICANS  WANT A PRESIDENT THAT HAS AN  HARRISON FORD AIR FORCE ONE MOMENT OF, "GET OFF MY PLANE."
I DON'T WANT MY PRESIDENT TO  BE THERE
John: BUT YOU WANT THE  OPTION. IN A CHOICE BETWEEN PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND MITT ROMNEY IN TERMS  OF FENDING OFF AN ALIEN ATTACK, YOU WOULD GO WITH PRESIDENT  OBAMA. MITT ROMNEY IS JUST GOING TO  THROW MONEY AT THE PROBLEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I THINK WHEN GIVEN THE CHOICE  BETWEEN MITT ROMNEY AND  PRESIDENT OBAMA IN ALMOST ANYTHING I WOULD CHOOSE  PRESIDENT OBAMA. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: ALL RIGHT. WE GET IT. THAT ISSUE WAS SETTLED. RELAX. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MOVIES USED  TO BE ABOUT, MAYBE IT'S AN AGE  THING. MOVIES USED TO BE ABOUT  PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE  WE HAD OLDER PRESIDENTS. THEY'RE ALL YOUNGER ONES.
THAT'S WHAT THIS ONE IS  SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. DID IT NOT WORK?
John: IT DID WORK. THERE'S A BELIEF DOWN INSIDE YOU  SOMEWHERE THAT EVEN IF THERE'S A  FAILURE THAT JAMIE FOX IS GOING TO PROTECT THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT HE'S  GOING TO FIGHT HIS WAY OUT.
HE TOTALLY WAS. John: DON'T LAUGH. I THINK JAMIE FOX EVEN NOT IN  CHARACTER WOULD PERSONALLY  DEFEND THE WHITE HOUSE.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I PUT MY LIFE IN JAMIE FOX'S... WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
John: I MET YOUR DAUGHTER  BACK STAGE. SHE'S A DELIGHTFUL CREATURE. HOW IS IT BRINGING UP DAUGHTERS  IN NEW YORK?
IT'S VERY HARD. John: THERE WAS THIS ONE  MOMENT THIS WEEKEND I WAS  WALKING PAST A PLAYGROUND. WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE IN  AMERICA?
A PLAYGROUND. John: POTATO, POTATO. AND THERE WERE THESE TWO LITTLE  GIRL STANDING OUTSIDE ONE OF  THEM WAS DRESSED UP IN THEIR DRESS WITH A NICE HANDBAG AND  LITTLE BRAIDS IN HER HAIR. SHE TURNED TO THE ONE NEXT TO  HER AND LOOKED REALLY ANGRY AND  SAID YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS GOING TO BE DRESSY. AT A PLAYGROUND. THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR A  CHILD.
WELL, MY DAUGHTER BACK STAGE  IS WEARING A SHIRT THAT SAID  BRAVE MEN RUN IN MY FAMILY.
John: YOU HAVE AN AWESOME  DAUGHTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE.
THANK YOU  John: I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WHITE HOUSE DOWN.
GO SEE WHITE HOUSE DOWN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL,  LADIES AND
