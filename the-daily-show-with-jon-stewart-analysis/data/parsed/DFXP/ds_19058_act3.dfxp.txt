Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF HEEL.
LOOK AT, THESE ARE THE DUMBEST SHOES.
Jon: YEAH THAT'S HARD TO WALK IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I WALK AROUND IN THESE PUPPIES. YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE  THEM. I HAD TO PUT THEM UP. WHY AM I WASTING MY TIME WALKING OUT IN THESE. I'D BETTER WATCH IT.
Jon: IN GENERAL, WHAT IS -- BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE WORKING TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS THE TIME LIMIT, YOU THINK, YOU COULD GET AROUND WALKING ON ONE OF THOSE BAD BOYS?
I COULD BARELY MAKE IT DOWN THE HALL. >>Jon: SO YOU GOT ABOUT 30 SECONDS OF TIME.
YEAH I'M LIKE A MOM NOW. LOOK AT THESE STUPID THINGS.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT MY MOM USED TO WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH I DO HOUSEWORK IN THESE JON.
Jon: YES, IF YOUR MOM MAYBE WORKED AT MOULIN ROUGE. I COULD STAB SOMEONE WITH THEM. THAT WOULD HAPPEN. >>Jon: YOU COULD DO THAT. THAT IS WEAPONRY.
MY CUTE LOUBIES.
Jon: AWFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THAT KIND OF THING.
BUT FOR YOU, JON.
Jon: IS THAT FOR REAL?
YEAH, I DID IT FOR YOU. [Audience: AWW] I WANTED TO LOOK SASSY FOR YOU. THE FACT THAT A WOMAN WOULD MAKE HERSELF TERRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME. IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
I KNOW.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS FILM AND THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU AS AN ACTRESS.  YOU DISAPPEAR INTO THIS CHARACTER.  [LAUGHTER]
OH, THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT WAS A REAL TRANSFORMATION.
Jon: I SAW HER AND I KNEW IT WAS YOU BUT IT JUST--
THEN YOU FORGOT.
Jon: PEOPLE SAY OH, IT'S THE WIG.
NO. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THAT I DIVE DEEP. I DIVE DEEP.
Jon: WHAT YOU BROUGHT TO -- WHAT IS THE CHARACTER'S NAME?
WILD STYLE.
Jon: WILD STYLE, SHE IS -- WHAT IS SHE? [LAUGHTER]
WELL, YOU KNOW IN THE MOVIE SHE'S DATING BATMAN.
Jon: WHAT?
YEAH. IT'S HER BOYFRIEND, BATMAN. HE'S A NARCISSISTIC JERK, THIS GUY, RIGHT?
Jon: WHAT? BATMAN?
YEAH, BATMAN, HE'S GOT SOME ISSUES. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW. HE'S AN ORPHAN. A REAL DARK GUY. HE'S DARK. HE'S DARK IN HIS HEART. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT  HIM. HE'S REALLY THE DARK KNIGHT OR SO I'VE HEARD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A CRIME FIGHTER  AND STAND FOR ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THE WORLD.
SURE.
Jon: WHY PICK A BAT? WHY TRANSFORM INTO A VAMPIRE? WHY NOT PICK SOMEBODY EVERYBODY LOVES, A BEAVER?
I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS THAT LOVE BEAVER. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE. >>Jon: I WALKED INTO THAT. WHEN I TELL YOU WHY I WAS THINKING OF THAT.
I DON'T WANNA KNOW WHY YOU WERE THINKING THAT, JON.
Jon: NO NO, WHEN I TELL YOU WHY, HERE IS WHAT IS GOING TO UPSET YOU WHEN I WAS THINKING OF THAT ANIMAL. SO, MY KID IS IN THIRD GRADE.
YOUR CHILD. YOUR CHILD MADE YOU THINK OF A BEAVER?
Jon: THEY DID A WHOLE MUSEUM PROJECT ON THE LENI LENAPE  INDIANS  AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY HUNTED GAME, BEAVER, AND THEY HAD A WHOLE EXHIBIT.  AND THAT IS WHY BEAVER-- AND YOU TURNED IT INTO A VAGINA REFERENCE. [LAUGHTER]  A VAGINA REFERENCE!
YOU JUST TURNED IT INTO A VAGINA REFERENCE!  >>Jon: NO, YOU MADE A VAG-- >>: Elizabeth: NO YOU SAID VAGINA. I DIDN'T SAY VAGINA, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Jon: BUT YOU SAID WITH IT A KNOWING NOD.
AND YOU JUST SAID THAT THE NATIVE AMERICANS ATE THE BEAVERS? IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TELLING ME. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS EITHER.
Jon: SEE AGAIN, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
WHAT? [APPLAUSE]
Jon: THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. CAN I SAY SOMETHING? THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IF SHE WAS WEARING ESPADRILLES, NEVER. [LAUGHTER] IS THAT A SHOE THAT'S A  REASONABLE REFERENCE? THAT WAS A-- THAT MADE ME QUESTION YOU.
Jon: ESPADRILLES? DO PEOPLE STILL WEAR THOSE? CAUSE THAT WAS A BIG THING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. >>SURE, OF COURSE. THEY'RE VERY SASSY. IT'S A SUMMER SHOE, AN ESPADRILLE, REALLY.
Jon: BUT IT'S A COMFORTABLE SHOE LIKE A SNEAKER.
MORE... NO, IT'S NOT A SNEAKER.
Jon: IT'S NOT A CLOG.
IT'S NOT THIS, LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT AN ESPADRILLE IS NOT. IT'S NOT THIS.
Jon: IT'S NOT THAT. DO YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING CALLED THE EARTH SHOE. IT WAS THE ANTITHESIS OF THIS. IT WAS THE OPPOSITE OF THIS. ITS HEEL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOWER THAN THE --
YOU WALKED LIKE THIS?
Jon: YES BECAUSE SOMEHOW THAT'S HOW CAVEMEN WALKED. OR SOMETHING. AND SO THEY CAME OUT WITH THEM-- THIS WAS ALSO IN THE 70'S. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR FEET AND YOUR SOUL. THERE WAS A LOT IN THE 70s THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR YOU. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT. >>HOW ABOUT THE SHOES WHERE YOUR TOES ARE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE A GLOVE FOR YOUR FOOT.
Jon: FOOT GLOVE? >>YEAH THE FOOT GLOVE.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I SEE SOMEBODY WALKING DOWN THE STREET IN THOSE.
Jon:  IN A FOOT GLOVE? YES!
Jon: ONLY IN LOS ANG-- PEOPLE IN NEW YORK DON'T WALK IN A FOOT GLOVE, TRUST ME. [ LAUGHTER ] UNLESS THOSE THINGS HAVE SOME SORT OF POLYURETHANE URINE PROTECTION. [LAUGHTER] LEGO MOVIE IS IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: ELIZABETH BANKS, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
