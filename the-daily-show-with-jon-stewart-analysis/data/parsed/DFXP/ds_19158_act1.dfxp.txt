FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS. FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS, TIA TORRES FROM ANIMAL PLANET SHOW "PIT BULLS & PAROLEES" IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE. GENERAL TONY ZINNI YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT SYRIA, HMM. PIT BULLS & PAROLEES, UH-HUH! BUT FIRST MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE FAST APPROACHING AND THERE MAY BE A TENDENCY TO DISMISS THEM, TO IGNORE THEM, TO THINK THEM INSIGNIFICANT TO STAND OUTSIDE OF MIDTERM POLLING STATIONS SHOUTING IN A MAINLY SARCASTIC TONE, OOOH LOOK AT ALL THE VOTING MC-VOTINGTONS! HOW IS THE VOTING GOING, VOTEY? WELL, IT TURNS OUT, YOU'RE THE JERK.
RIGHT NOW EVERY SEAT COUNTS IN THE FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF THE SENATE.
REPUBLICANS NEED TO TAKE JUST SIX SEATS AWAY FROM THOSE DEMOCRATS.
IT'S A HIGH-STAKES ELECTION YEAR.
THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE.
THE STAKES THIS YEAR COULDN'T BE HIGHER.
THE STAKES ARE STUNNING.
Jon: THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STAKES I'VE EVER SEEN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I OFFER YOU $1 MILLION FOR JUST ONE NIGHT WITH THOSE STAKES. (LAUGHTER) SO JUST A FEW RACES WILL DECIDE WHO RUN CONGRESS'S UPPER HOUSE AND THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014: SENATE CONTROL: THE RACE TO GET FILIBUSTERED. NOW PERHAPS THE ONE PERSON WHO STANDS TO BENEFIT MOST FROM SHIFTING SENATE CONTROL IS CURRENT SENATE MINORITY LEADER KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN MITCH McCONNELL WHO CURRENTLY LEADS CHALLENGER ALISON GRIMES BY 8 POINTS. YEP. THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF SENATE CONTROL, NEY, OUR ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE MAY REST ON THE EFFICACY OF GRIMES' MESSAGE.
DEMOCRAT ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES IS OUT WITH A NEW AD.
I'M NOT BARACK OBAMA, I DISAGREE WITH HIM ON GUNS, COAL AND THE EPA. AND MITCH, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU HOLD A GUN, I'M ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES. AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S THE DEMOCRAT. (LAUGHTER) WELL, I COULD SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, McCONNELL'S WEAPON HOLDING FORM WOULD BE AN ISSUE IF SENATORS WERE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST ISIS. (LAUGHTER) BUT LAST I CHECKED THEIR MAIN JOB RESPONSIBILITIES WERE RAISING MONEY FOR THEMSELVES AND PREVENTING LAWS FROM BEING ENACTED. (LAUGHTER) AND TO BE FAIR TO McCONNELL WE DON'T KNOW IN THAT PICTURE IF HE WAS, IN FACT, HANDING THE GUN TO A GIANT. HE COULD HAVE BEEN. (LAUGHTER) BUT CERTAINLY THAT COMMERCIAL CANNOT BE MORE  EMASCULATING UNLESS IT ALSO WENT AFTER THE WAY McCONNELL URINATED. HOW DO WE KNOW McCONNELL WILL STAND UP FOR KENTUCKY? (LAUGHTER) I LIKE TO PEE SITTING DOWN. I PAID FOR THE WARM TOILET SEAT.
LOOK, McCONNELL IS AN OLD PRO. HE KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE. HE'S NOT GOING TO STOOP TO THIS LEVEL.
AND NOW LEADER McCONNELL FIRING BACK.
OH, AND YOU KNOW WHO ALSO DID A PUBLICITY STUNT FIRING A GUN?
Jon: STALIN! (LAUGHTER) BIN LADEN! EVERY POLITICIAN EVER. (LAUGHTER)
WHO ALSO DID A PUBLICITY STUNT FIRING A GUN? BARACK OBAMA.
Jon: I SURE NAILED HER. YEP. WAIT, LET'S MOVE ON TO ALASKA WHERE REPUBLICAN DAN SULLIVAN HOLDS A TWO POINT LEAD OVER INCUMBENT SENATOR MARK BEGICH, THEY HAVE GOT TO BE ABOVE THE WHOLE WHO'S MORE REGULAR FOLKS GAME, RIGHT?
WE HAD WAITED DECADES TO DRILL HERE IN THE NATIONAL PETROLEUM RESERVE, BUT WASHINGTON WILL STILL SAY NO. NEXT YEAR, THE OIL STARTS FLOWING. I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE, BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER WASHINGTON WILL FIGURE OUT THAT I DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.
Jon: AGAIN, THAT'S THE, THAT'S THE DEMOCRAT IN THE RACE. BUT ANYWAY, JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS OF THOSE SNOWMOBILES LEARNED, I'M MARK BEGICH, AND I WILL STEAL YOUR [BLEEP]. ALL RIGHT, SO HE TAKES A STRONG STAND AGAINST OVERREGULATION AND FOR ZIPPING AROUND ON ONE OF THEM SNOW MOBILES. TAKE A GUESS WHICH ONE OF THOSE THREADS SULLIVAN'S REBUTTAL PICKS UP ON.
I'M COREY DAVIS. AS A FOUR TIME X GAMES MEDALIST, I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT SNOW MACHINES THAT IS WHY I HAD A GOOD LAUGH WHEN I SAW MARK BEGICH PRETENDING TO RIDE ONE, THAT'S WHY I'M WITH DAN SULLIVAN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE WHOLE SENATE IS BOILING DOWN TO -- WHO CARES WHO SNOW MACHINES MORE AUTHENTICALLY? YOU DO KNOW THAT ONCE YOU GET TO WASHINGTON, THE WHOLE SNOW MACHINE ISSUE IS PRETTY MOOT. IN D.C. THEY MAINLY GET AROUND IN THEM ROAD MACHINES. SENATOR BEGICH WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO THESE SNOW MACHINE TRUTHERS?
BEGICH SPOKESMAN MAX CROES SAYS THERE WAS NO PRETENDING. BEGICH TOLD "POLITICO" HE RODE FOR A LONG TIME THAT DAY AND GOT FROST BITE ON HIS EARS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FROST BITE ON YOUR EAR, WELL DONE, JACK LONDON. DAY FIVE, MY RIGHT EAR HURTS. (LAUGHTER) PERHAPS NEXT TIME I'LL HAVE MY CHIEF OF STAFF BRING THE HAT WITH THE FLAPS. (LAUGHTER) TELL MY SNOW MACHINE I MISS HER. IF THAT'S WHAT KENTUCKY AND ALASKA ARE FIGHTING OVER, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOUISIANA DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU IS DOING TO CLOSE THE FOUR POINT GAP BETWEEN HER AND THE GOP'S BILL CASSIDY.
SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU JOINED THE PARTY OUTSIDE OF TIGER STADIUM BEFORE THE LSU GAME ON SATURDAY TAKING A BREAK FROM SHAKING HANDS AND POLITE CONVERSATION TO HELP A COED WITH A KEG STAND.
Jon: WHO WANTS TO DO LINES OFF MY ASS! COME ON, EVERYBODY, LET'S PARTY! (APPLAUSE) THE SURVIVAL OF  OBAMACARE HANGS IN THE BALANCE. IF ALIENS CAME DOWN TO EARTH AND WATCHED OUR POLITICAL ADS THEY WOULD THINK THE SENATE WAS AN ADULT SUMMER CAMP COMPETITION OR SOME SIX YEAR PASS TO DAVE & BUSTERS. WE GOT SHOOTING, SNOW MACHINES, FRIDAY NIGHT'S KEG NIGHT. COME ON DOWN TO THE SENATE!
REALLY, JON, WOULD ALIENS SAY THAT?
Jon: WHAT IS THAT-- SAM? DID YOU-- WHO SAID THAT? I--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
Jon: SAM WHERE DID-- WHERE DID YOU COME FROM, HOW DID?
FROM MY HOME PLANET. I HEARD YOU DISCUSSING YOUR SPECIES'S STUPID POLITICAL ADS.
Jon: YOUR HOME PLANET? WHAT, ARE YOU AN ALIEN, SAM.
ACTUALLY, EARTHLING THE NAME IS ZORBUM 37, PLEASED TO MEET YOU. HELLO.
Jon: OKAY, WOW, I NEVER-- THAT'S WEIRD. I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU'RE AN ALIEN.
WHY, WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE GREEN SKIN OR ANTENNA OR 8 BREASTS. BECAUSE MY FINGER DOESN'T LIGHT UP AND I'M NOT ALL-- PHONE HOME. JON, JESUS, IF I WALKED AROUND LIKE THAT I WOULD BLOW YOUR TINY HUMAN MINDS. SO TO BLEND IN I HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF THE IDEAL FEMALE SPECIMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW, HOW -- I MEAN YOU BLEND IN UNBELIEVABLY -- HOW, WAS IT HARD TO LEARN OUR LANGUAGE?
OH, YES, GOD.
Jon: COULD YOU, IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING IN I GUESS ZURBUMESE, IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT?
I MEAN, I COULD BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND A WORD. GREETINGS EARTHLINGS WE COME IN PEACE. SEE, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE OUR LANGUAGE JUST SLOWER AND ATONAL. THAT'S ALL.
REALLY? I DON'T HEAR THAT. TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER. NO, TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER. I DON'T HEAR IT.
Jon: YEAH OKAY, SINCE YOU ARE A REAL ALIEN, THOUGH, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR CAMPAIGN PROCESS.
OUR CAMPAIGN ADS ARE FAR MORE ADVANCED. IT'S REALLY NO WONDER WE CONQUER YOUR PLANET IN FEBRUARY.
Jon: WAIT -- I'M SORRY -- WHAT'S THAT?
OH, NOTHING. SORRY. HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME SHOW YOU THE AD THAT WON ME MY SEAT ON THE INTERSTELLAR LAW COUNCIL.
Jon: SURE.
THIS ELECTION THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. FROM FIGHTING THE WAR ON SPACE SLIME TO EDUCATING OUR SHAPE-SHIFTING BABY CLONE ARMY. YET MY OPPONENT EATS PURPLE MEGTAR AND DOESN'T EVEN OWN A PHOTRON GYROMETRON. ALSO IF YOU VOTE FOR MY OPPONENT I WILL DESTROY OUR PLANET WITH A VEXLOR RAY. I AM ZORBUM 37 AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. END TRANSMISSION. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I GOTTA SAY, IT'S NOT THAT, IF I'M BEING HONEST, IF I'M BEING HONEST, IT'S REALLY NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM OUR ADS.
HUH? I DON'T SEE IT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, SAM, SAMANTHA BEE EVERYBODY OR ZORBUM 37.
ZORBUM 37.
SORRY ABOUT THAT. ZORBUM 37. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
