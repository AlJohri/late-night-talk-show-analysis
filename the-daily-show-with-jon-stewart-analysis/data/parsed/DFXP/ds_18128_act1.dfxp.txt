WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN EGYPT,  BEST KNOWN FOR ITS  SPECTACULAR SUPPORTING ROLE IN BRENDAN FRASIER'S THE  MUMMY AND THE MUMMY RETURNS. HOW DID EGYPT NOT GET  NOMINATED FOR THAT MOVIE. NOW IF YOU RECALL IN 2011  EGYPT HAD A BONA FIDE  PEACEFUL AND POPULAR  REVOLUTION ENDING THE RULE OF LONG TIME DICTATOR HOSNI  MUBARAK AND USHERING IN  EGYPT'S FIRST FREE ELECTION IN 5,000 YEARS. WHEN OF COURSE A BIRD WITH  EYES WITH LINES UNDER IT WON  A COMFORTABLE EIGHT POINTS. THEN IN 2012 MOM-- MO MAM ED  MORSI WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT  AND EGYPTIAN COULD COULD ENJOY THE SWEET FRUITS OF  DEMOCRACY. JUST ONE PROBLEM O EGYPT  DOES I HAVE WARM CLIMATE AND  YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO  FRUIT.
JUST HOURS AGO THE  COUNTRY'S EXPERIMENT WITH  DEMOCRACY APPEARED TO GO UP IN FLAMES. THE MILITARY REMOVED  MOHAMMED MORSIST-- MORSI,  SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTION  AND INSTALLED THE COUNTRY'S TOP JUDGE AS INTERIM  PRESIDENT.
THAT'S RIGHT, INTERIM  PRESIDENT, OR AS IT  INCREASINGLY IS BEING KNOWN, THE ONLY KIND OF PRESIDENT  EGYPT HAS. WELL, WE'VE GOT AN  OLD-FASHIONED MILITARY  COUPON OUR HANDS. THE ARMY SUB VERSING THE  DEMOCRATIC WILL OF THE  PEOPLE, THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE  MUST BE DEVASTATED.
ARMY HELICOPTERS FLYING  EGYPTIAN FLAGS CIRCLED  OVERHEAD. PROMPTING ROARS OF APPROVAL  FROM THE PROTESTORS IN  TAHRIR SQUARE.
A HEART DRAWN IN THE SKY,  MESSAGE FROM EGYPT'S  MILITARY, THEIR SUPPORTERS ON THE SQUARE BELOW.
OH, EGYPTIAN AIR FORCE,  ARE YOU TRYING TO SEDUCE THE  ENTIRE POPULATION OF CAIRO? BECAUSE FIRST THEY DID A SKY  WRITTEN VALENTINE. THEN SOME SKY WRITTEN  FLOWERS AND THEN SOME SKY  WRITTEN HOOKUP PLANS FOR  LATER. BUT MORSI WAS BARELY IN  POWER FOR-- GROW UP, GROW  UP. MORSI WAS IN POWER BARELY  FOR A YEAR. WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE  DONE TO MAKE EVERYONE SO  GLAD TO SEE HIM GO.
MORSI WAS GOING AROUND  PUTTING POLITICAL OPPONENTS  IN JAIL, HARASSING THEM, PHYSICALLY INTIMIDATING  THEM.
IMPOSING HIS WILL AND  SIDELINING LIBERALS AND  MODERATE VOICES.
THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD  HAVE CURVED RELIGIOUS FRO  DOM.
THE ECONOMY IS ON THE  BRINK OF COLLAPSE,  UNEMPLOYMENT IS TERRIBLE. TOVER TURE IS NOW MORE UNDER  MORSI THAN MUBARAK.
WOW THAT IS AN IMPRESSIVE  AMOUNT OF STUFF IN JUST 12  MONTHS. HE REALLY LIVED UP TO HIS  CAMPAIGN SLOGAN MORSI 2012,  SO WITH MORSI GONE  EVERYONE'S HAPPY EXCEPT, HERE'S THE THING, THEY ARE  NOT. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM A  LITTLE EARLIER MORSI WAS  DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED WHICH MEANS A LOT OF THE 13  MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT VOTED  FOR HIM ARE PRETTY PISSED  OFF. THEY ARE PISSED OFF FIRST AT  THE ARMY AND SECONDLY  THEY'RE MAD WITH-- GUESS  WHO?
PROTESTORS LIKE ALLAH  REGULAR ABBY SAYS THE U.S. TALKS ABOUT-- BUT DID  NOTHING TO PROTECT EGYPT  DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED  PRESIDENT.
MR. MORSI WILL BE BACK. WILL BE BACK. YES, WE CAN. I WANT TO SAY TO OBAMA, YES,  WE CAN.
HEY, HEY, HEY! THAT IS OUR UPLIFTING SLOGAN  TO BE IRONICALLY APPROPRIATED  AND SAR CASTICALLY THROWN BACK INTO OUR PRESIDENT'S  FACE. GET YOUR OWN! BUT OKAY, OKAY. SO MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IS  ANGRY WITH AMERICA. SPOILER ALERT. THAT'S FINE. BECAUSE AT LEAST THIS WEEK  WE HAVE MORSI'S OPPONENTS ON  OUR SIDE.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN  COMPLAINTS WITH THE U.S. AS THIS POSTER MAKES CLEAR,  THEY BELIEVE AMERICA WAS TOO  CLOSE TO MOHAMMED MORSI AS HIS CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC  PARTY.
HOLY [BLEEP].
SO EVEN NATIONS THOUGHT  OF ACTUAL MUSLIMS THINK A  BOMB CERTIFICATE A SECRET  MUSLIM. OF COURSE WHAT NEITHER OF  THOSE SIDES UNDERSTAND HERE  IS THAT AMERICA'S GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ESPECIALLY CARE  WHOSE'S RUNNING EGYPT AS  LONG AS WE HAVE INFLUENCE  WITH THEM. THAT IS WHY WE SEND THEM 1.6  BILLION DOLLARS IN AID EACH  YEAR. THAT'S RIGHT. BY THE WAY, WE SEND EGYPT  1.6 BILLION DOLLARS IN AID  EACH YEAR. AND WE DO NOT WANT TO STOP  DOING THAT. THEY'RE A VITAL ALLY FOR  NEWS THAT PART OF THE WORLD. IN FACT, I ACTUALLY HAVE  NEXT YEAR'S MONEY RIGHT HERE,  WHICH-- WHICH WE BADLY WANT TO BRIBE EGYPT W I MEAN HELP  THEM WITH, BRIBE, HELP, IT'S  A GRAY AREA. THE POINT IS, WHO SHOULD I  MAKE THIS COMICALLY  OVERSIZED NOVELTY CHECK OUT  TO.
U.S. LAW, THE FOREIGN  ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961  EXPLICITLY SAYS THE  ADMINISTRATION CANNOT FINANCIALLY SUPPORT AN ARMY  THAT IS INVOLVED IN A  MILITARY COUP.
WHAT? SO NOW WE CAN'T EVEN GIVE  EGYPT MONEY? (LAUGHTER)  THROWING MONEY AT THE  PROBLEM HAS LONG BEEN THE  BACKBONE OF AMERICA'S FOREIGN POLICY. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS. THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS. THAT WE ARE PREVENTED FROM  OUR OWN LAWS FROM GIVING  STRATEGICALLY ALLIES ANY  SORPT OF COUP AID.
OH, GOD, NO, NO, NO, NO,  NO. NO, NO! I CLEARLY SAID COUP AID, NOT  COOL AID, ARE YOU PAYING FOR  THAT WALL. SO IT LOOKS LIKE-- IT LOOKS  LIKE WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP  GIVING EGYPT MONEY. BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY DENY  THAT THIS WAS A COUP, RIGHT?
THE LEGAL DETERMINATION  THAT A COUP HAPPENED WOULD  REQUIRE A SUSPENSION OR CUTTOFF IN ALL  NONHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANT  DANCE TO EGYPT INCLUDING ITS  1.3 BILLION IN FMF IS THAT  CORRECT?
WELL, MATT, BECAUSE WE'RE  NOTS THERE, WE HAVEN'T MADE  THAT DETERMINATION.
I KNOW, BUT THAT  DETERMINATION WOULD TRIGGER  A CUTTOFF OR SUSPENSION OF THE ASSISTANCE IS THAT  CORRECT?
AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO BE  ANALYZING WHAT THE LEGAL  OPTIONS ARE HERE. THAT IS BEING CLOSELY LOOKED  AT.
SO THAT IS OUR STRATEGY. WE THINK WE CAN GET AROUND  OUR OWN COUP RULE IF WE CAN  JUST MANAGE TO NOT USE THE WORD COUP. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S LIKE A GAME SHOW. YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO  DESCRIBE THE EVENTS IN EGYPT  BUT IF YOU SAY THE WORD COUP, WILL YOU LOSE EVERYTHING. IT'S LIKE THE 100,000 DOLLAR  PYRAMID EXCEPT IT'S 1.6  BILLION DOLLARS AND THE  PYRAMID IS AN ACTUAL  PYRAMID. (LAUGHTER)  SO LET'S DO THIS, LET'S DO  THIS! LET'S PLAY! HERE'S OUR FIRST CONTESTANT,  STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN  JENNIFER SAKI, LET'S GO.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF  FACTORS BEING CLOSELY LOOKED  AT. THERE IS A BROAD LEGAL  DEFINITION THAT IS  APPLICABLE IN MANY CASES. A WIDE-RANGING, HIGH LEVEL  INTERAGENCY PROCESS  DETERMINING THE NEXT STEPS  ON OUR POLICY FOR EGYPT. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE  ON ITS GROUND WHO DO NOT  THINK IT WAS A COUP.
WOW. SHE IS GOOD. SHE IS GOING KAMA SUTRA ON  THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,  BENDING WORDS INTO ALL KINDS  OF EXCITING EXOTIC POSITIONS BEFORE REACHING A CLIMAX OF  MEANINGLESSNESS. (LAUGHTER)
WILL YOU LET US KNOW WHEN  THE HEAT FROM THE FLAMES OF  THE BURNING HOOPS THAT YOU ARE JUMPING THROUGH TO AVOID  TAKING A POSITION ON THIS  GET TOO HOT, OR WILL THAT JUST BE OBVIOUS FROM --
MATT, IF YOU ARE HAVING A  GOOD TIME TODAY I WILL BE  BACK HERE TOMORROW. WE'LL DO THIS AGAIN.
OH, THOSE TWO ARE GOING  TO [BLEEP] LIKE RABBITS WHEN  THEY GET HOME. THAT'S A FACT. (APPLAUSE)
OUR NEXT CONTESTANTS IN  THE 1.6 BILLION DOLLAR  PYRAMID IS WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JAY CARNEY WHO  SOMEHOW TRIES TO BE  UNEQUIVOCAL IN HIS  EQUIVICATION.
IN ANSWER TO YOUR  QUESTION, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT  WHAT WE CALL WHAT HAPPENED, I'LL BE BLUNT. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY  COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT  SITUATION. I'M TRYING TO BE VERY CANDID,  IS THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX  SITUATION.
I'M BEING VERY CLEAR WITH  YOU AND NEDRA AND EVERYONE  HERE THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND AGAIN I'M TRYING TO BE  CANDID HERE ABOUT, YOU'LL  GET NO ARGUMENT FROM ME IF YOU GO ON THE AIR AND SAY  THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY  COMPLICATED SITUATION.
THAT POOR MAN. I HONESTLY CANNOT TELL IF  HE'S DOING A TERRIBLE JOB OR  JUST HAS A TERRIBLE JOB. (LAUGHTER)
I THINK IT MIGHT BE 100  PERCENT OF BOTH. THE LOGIC OF THIS SITUATION  IS INSANE. IT'S AS IF KATE MIDDLETON  GAVE BIRTH BUT ENGLISH LAW  PREVENTED HER FROM CALLING THE THING SHE WAS HOLDING A  BABY. YES, THIS TINY HUMAN EMERGED  FROM MY WOMB AFTER NINE  MONTHS OF GESTATION BUT IS IT A BABY, I DON'T THINK WE  SHOULD GET BOGGED DOWN IN  CALLING IT THAT QUITE YET. THE PROBLEM IS, WE CAN TRY  TO PARS WORDS ON THIS ALL WE  WANT. WE CAN CALL THIS A MORSIECTOMY,  A SURGICAL REMOVAL OF A MAN  FROM THE BODY OF THE COUNTRY HE WAS HURTING. BUT EVERYONE IS GOING TO  KNOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING. LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, WE CAN  DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED IN  EGYPT AS A COMPLICATED AND MULTIFACETED SITUATION, BUT  EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THAT IS  JUST A FANCY LEGAL WAY TO AVOID CALLING IT WHAT IT IS,  A COMPLETE CLUSTER [BLEEP]. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
