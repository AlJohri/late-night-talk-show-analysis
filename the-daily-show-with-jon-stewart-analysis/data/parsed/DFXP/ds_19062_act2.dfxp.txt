Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. HAVE YOU NOTICED JUST A TOUCH MORE EXISTENTIAL ENNUI IN THE AIR THIS WEEK? NO? APPARENTLY THEY HAVEN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.
FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE BEGINS AN OFFICIAL VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES ON MONDAY, THE FIRST BY A FRENCH PRESIDENT SINCE 1996.
THEY HOPE TO TALK ABOUT STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC TIES AND WORKING TOGETHER ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
Jon: SORRY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO INTERRUPT THERE. WE PLAYED A CLIP FROM THE AL JAZEERA AMERICA CHANNEL THAT WAS THREATENING TO GET INAPPROPRIATELY IN-DEPTH ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. OBVIOUSLY AL JAZEERA AMERICA IS NEW HERE AND DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THINGS. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW AMERICAN AMERICA NETWORKS DO.
FRENCH PRESIDENT FRANCOIS HOLLANDE ARRIVES IN THE U.S.
HE IS FLYING SOLO.
HE IS HERE ALONE.
THE FRENCH PRESIDENT IS COMING STAG. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: STAG. ALONE. SOLO. [LAUGHTER] BY HIS LONESOME. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S THE NEWS IT'S 2014 WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT BUT APPARENTLY CAN'T HANDLE A FOREIGN DATELESS ONE. WHY ISN'T THE CROQUE MONSIEUR BRINGING HIS CROQUE MADAM?
HE ANNOUNCED HIS SPLIT FROM A PARTNER OF SEVEN YEARS AMID REPORTS HE CHEATED ON HER WITH A YOUNGER ACTRESS.
MOVIE ACTRESS IS JULIE GUILLET. SHE'S NOT COMING EITHER. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ALSO NOT COMING HOLLANDE'S SECOND MISTRESS A WAIF-ISH CIGARETTE GIRL NOT AS WORLDLY WISE AS SHE PRETENDS OR HIS THIRD MISTRESS, A CAT WITH A WHITE STRIPE ON HIS BACK. [LAUGHTER] A FRENCH MAN HAS AN AFFAIR. IT'S THE DOG BITES MAN OF FRANCE. WHY DOES THIS CHANGE ANYTHING?
THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO COME ALONE HAS PEOPLE TALKING AND WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS SCRAMBLING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: TO DATE HIM?
THAT ICONIC PHOTO THAT WE SEE AT EVERY STATE DINNER WITH THE TWO COUPLES WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
Jon: NOT THAT DIFFERENT. I MEAN HE WILL BE WEARING PANTS.
300 DINNER INVITATIONS ENGRAVED WITH THE FORMER FIRST LADY'S NAME HAD TO BE SCRAPPED.
Jon: WE CAN KILL PEOPLE WITH SKY ROBOTS FROM 1,000 MILES AWAY, I THINK WE CAN SHRED 300 INVITATIONS. I DON'T MEAN TO TRIVIALIZE THIS ETIQUETTE NIGHTMARE.
HOW WILL THAT AFFECT SEATING AT THE HUGE STATE DINNER?
SEATING ARRANGEMENTS ARE MADE DELICATE AT BEST.
THESE THINGS ARE NOT JUST CHANCE. NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S SPECIFIC.
OUR PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY WOULD BE SEATED NEXT TO THE SPOUSE. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO CHANGE.
Jon: DANGER, DANGER. HOW WILL THEY HANDLE THE SEATING? OH, MY -- [LAUGHTER] HELLO, YES, EMILY POST, WE HAVE A CODE FRANCE. REPEAT A CODE FRANCE. WHAT IS THAT? REALLY DIED IN 1960? SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? IT'S UP TO ME TO SOLVE THIS ETIQUETTE EMERGENCY. IT'S SO HORRIBLE. THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. OBAMA SITTING HERE AND THE FRENCH PRESIDENT HERE. THEN WAIT A MINUTE, OKAY, SOLVED. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FINE, WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT TO TELL US ABOUT THIS TAWDRY SOAP OPERA AND HOW IT'S THROWN A MEAL INTO TURMOIL.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE DINNER, OF COURSE. FRANCE IS A TOP US ALLY AND TOPICS LIKE SYRIA AND IRAN ARE ON THE TABLE.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR GETTING INTO ACTUAL SUBSTANCE. TELL US ABOUT SYRIA AND IRAN.
TOPICS LIKE SYRIA AND IRAN ARE ON THE TABLE BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW FOREIGN AFFAIRS SEEM OVERSHADOWED BY AFFAIRS OF THE HEART.
Jon: YES. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DO SEEM OVERSHADOWED BECAUSE YOU ARE BLOCKING ALL THE LIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
