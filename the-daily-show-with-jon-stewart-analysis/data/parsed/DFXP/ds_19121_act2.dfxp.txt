Jon: WELLCOME BACK. GOVERNMENT OVERREACH HAS BEEN A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE OF LATE. WHETHER THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES, I'M NOT REALLY SURE. AL MADRIGAL FILED THIS REPORT.
IN 2008, LOUISIANA CAME TO ITS SENSES AND OUTLAWED THE BARBARIC SPORT OF COCK FIGHTING. AND THE CHICKENS OF THAT STATE FINALLY HAD SOME PEACE. STATE SENATOR ELBERT GUILLORY.
WE'VE OUTLAWED COCK FIGHTING. THOSE BLOOD SPORTS ARE NO LONGER ATTRACTIVE IN LOUISIANA. I AM NOT A FAN OF COCK FIGHTING, BUT I'D LOVE TO GO AND WATCH SOME CHICKEN BOXING.
I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. YOU JUST SAID "CHICKEN BOXING"?
YES, CHICKEN BOXING IN LOUISIANA IS STILL NOT LEGAL, BUT WE'RE FIGHTING TO MAKE IT LEGAL.
YOU MEANT TO SAY CHICKEN BOXING?
I MEANT TO SAY CHICKEN BOXING. HUMAN BEINGS PUT GLOVES ON AND BOX. CHICKENS CAN PUT GLOVES ON AND BOX.
RIGHT. HE'S TRYING TO LEGALIZE CHICKEN BOXING, WHICH IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN COCKFIGHTING. WAIT. MAYBE THAT IS COCKFIGHTING. ALL RIGHT. SWITCH 'EM AROUND. THAT'S CHICKEN BOXING AND THAT'S COCKFIGHTING?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHICKEN BOXING.
WHAT? WHAT ARE THESE?
THESE ARE CHICKEN BOXING GLOVES.
SO COCKFIGHTING VICIOUS?
MANY PEOPLE SAY SO.
BUT PLUS THIS, ADORABLE.
ABSOLUTELY A SAFE SPORT, IT'S A FAMILY SPORT.
SO NO COCKFIGHTING AND NO CHICKEN BOXING. WHAT'S NEXT, NO CHICKEN WRESTLING? IF IT WERE UP TO PEOPLE LIKE J.P. MORRELL, THE CHICKENS WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FUN.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARM THEM WITH, TWO CHICKENS GOING INTO A RING AND FIGHTING FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF PEOPLE IS WRONG.
IT'S TWO ADULT CONSENSUAL CHICKENS THAT ARE FIGHTING ON THE BEHALF OF BLOODTHIRSTY HUMANS.
CHICKENS DO NOT HAVE FREEWILL, THEREFORE...
CHICKENS ARE SMART. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION, SMART AS A CHICKEN.
I'VE NEVER HEARD IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S A THING.
MY DAD ALWAYS USED TO ALWAYS SAY, "AL, YOU'RE SMART AS A CHICKEN." AND I USED TO SAY, "THANKS, DAD."
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT. [LAUGHTER]
IT WAS. IT WAS. IT WAS A COMPLIMENT. IT DEFINITELY WAS A COMPLIMENT. BUT THESE SMART CHICKENS ARE TREATED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR HUMAN COUNTERPARTS.
THEY HAVE THE BEST FOOD. THEY HAVE THE BEST MEDICAL CARE. THEIR TRAINERS GIVE THEM MASSAGES. THESE ARE PREMIER ATHLETES.
WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT CHICKEN BOXING, RIGHT?
ABSOLUTELY.
AND THESE CHICKENS USE THE BEST FACILITIES, LIKE THIS HALLOWED HALL OF POULTRY PUGILISM. IT'S A SPECIAL PLACE WHERE THE LEGENDS OF THE SPORT WENT TALLON TO TALLON, LIKE WHEN MANNY PECK-QUAIO TOOK ON FLOYD MAYFEATHER. OR WHEN SUGAR SHANE POULTRY KNOCKED OUT, I DON'T KNOW, EVANDER HOLYFRIED? I'M RUNNING OUT OF [BLEEPED] CHICKEN PUNS.
THIS IS WHERE THE PRIMARY COMBATANTS GO TO IT. NO ONE HAD TO FORCE THEM. NO ONE HAD TO ENCOURAGE THEM.
I MEAN, YOU BROUGHT THEM IN AND PUT THEM IN THERE, BUT OTHER THAN THAT...
ABSOLUTELY.
STILL THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR MORELL WHO WANT TO TURN THEIR BACK ON THIS NOBLE PASTIME.
I AM NOT DEPRIVING CHICKENS OF A BETTER LIFE. I'M SAVING THEIR LIVES BY NOT LETTING THEM...
OKAY. I'M A CHICKEN. TELL ME WHY SHOULDN'T FIGHT?
YOU SHOULDN'T FIGHT FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF OTHERS. IT'S BARBARIC, IT'S STUPID AND THERE IS A BETTER LIFE FOR YOU.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY DID THAT. I'M A CHICKEN. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU [BLEEPED] SAID. THAT WAS HILARIOUS. YOU'RE A SENATOR. A SENATOR WHO DOESN'T SEE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY CLAWING HIM IN THE FACE.
THESE BIRDS, WARRIOR BIRDS, SELL FOR ANYWHERE BETWEEN $2,500 AND $25,000.
WHAT?
THAT IS REAL MONEY.
SO SUCK IT, "DAILY SHOW" NEWSROOM, AND WORLD, PLEASE SAY HELLO TO OSCAR DELAY POLLO.
COME ON, OSCAR. WORK THE BAG, WORK THE BAG. COME ON, OSCAR. YOU WANT THIS OR NOT? GO UPSTAIRS. GO UPSTAIRS. NOW, CHICKEN CHASE IS HOW WE USED TO DO IT IN THE OLD DAYS. YOU CAN CATCH THIS CHICKEN. YOU CAN CATCH THIS CHICKEN. COME ON. GET THE CHICKEN. GET THE CHICKEN. COME ON, YOU BUM. COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T HOP OVER IT. COME ON. YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM. DRINK IT. COME ON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
