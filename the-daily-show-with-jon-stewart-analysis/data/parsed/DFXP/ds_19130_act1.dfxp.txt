FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT'S GUEST, ACTRESS EMMA STONE IS GOING TO JOIN US. SHE'LL COME OUT, WE'LL TALK, JUST A COUPLE ACTORS TALKING. ALL RIGHT. ONE ACTOR TALKING. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST, THE REAL QUESTION IS THIS: WHAT TIME IS IT? DID YOU REALLY JUST SHOUT "PARTY TIME"? YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE I'M SETTING UP A BIT OF A ROUTINE HERE? [LAUGHTER] JUST GOT OUT OF COLLEGE, IT'S JUST A REFLEX. WHAT TIME IS IT? PARTY TIME! A LITTLE BIT QUIET NOW. A LITTLE BIT SOFTER NOW. YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF, TIME TO HAVE THE TV ON IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE I HAVE SEX. WRONG! [LAUGHTER] NOTHING ELSE? ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT TIME IT IS. I'M GOING TO LET MY FRIEND SARAH DO IT FOR ME.
THE MANY IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES OF BARACK OBAMA CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED. SO IT'S TIME TO IMPEACH.
Jon: IT'S TIME TO IMPEACH. ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S TIME TO STOP CHECKING SARAH PALIN'S FACEBOOK PAGE, BUT SHE POSTS SUCH CUTE PICTURES OF BABY GUNS. [LAUGHTER] WELL, SINCE CLICKING ON THAT PAGE THERE ALREADY CAUSED FACEBOOK TO CHANGE ALL MY POP-UP ADS TO SNOW MACHINE AND MOOSE CLUBBING PRODUCTS, LET'S STAY WITH IT.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH OF THE YEARS OF ABUSE FROM THIS PRESIDENT, HIS UNSECURED BORDER CRISIS, FOR ME IT'S THE LAST STRAW. IT MAKES KIND OF THE BATTERED WIFE SAY, NO MAS. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: NOW, IF I MAY, IT APPEARS EX-GOVERNOR PALIN IS FINALLY FINISHED WITH MANGLING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND HAS MOVED ON THE MAKING SPANISH INCOMPREHENSIBLE. SHE'S LIKE A SERIAL KILLER OF LANGUAGE. OR WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE OF A ROSETTA STONE IS. ANYWAY, THE POINT IS THIS: HER POINT IS THE REAL VICTIM OF CHILDREN FLEEING VIOLENCE IN CENTRAL AMERICA IS LATINA SARAH PALIN. IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO DISMISS THIS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT AS JUST ANOTHER SERVING OF SARAH PALIN'S PATENTED WORD SAUSAGES. IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T QUIT THEIR ELECTED OFFICES MID-TERM ARE ECHOING IT.
YOU GOTTA GO UP THERE AND YOU JUST IMPEACH HIM.
TELL ME HOW I CAN IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
IT WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE.
THERE ISN'T A WEEKEND THAT HASN'T GONE BY THAT SOMEONE SAYS TO ME, MICHELLE, WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU ALL WAITING FOR IN CONGRESS? WHY AREN'T YOU IMPEACHING THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: AND I'M LIKE, [BLEEPED] YOU. I'M EATING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I SAY. I SAY, I'M AT THE OLIVE GARDEN. LEAVE ME ALONE. WHY DON'T YOU IMPEACH HIM YOURSELF YOU PIECE OF [BLEEPED]. THAT'S MY MICHELE BACHMANN IMPRESSION. THE TRUTH IS FOR MOST REPUBLICANS, IMPEACHMENT IS PROBABLY TOO GOOD FOR THIS PRESIDENT.
HE DECLARED HIMSELF KING OBAMA.
THIS KING COMPLEX.
TYRANICAL DESPOT.
HE'S BECOME A MONARCH. OR AN EMPEROR.
A DICTATORSHIP.
MY GOD, HE'S A TYRANT.
TEA PARTIERS KNEW IN THE COLONIES THAT KING GEORGE'S DICTATORIAL METHODS WOULDN'T BE TOLERATED. WE WON'T TOLERATE THEM HERE. I'M RANDY WEBER AND DAMN PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHY DO I GET THE FEELING HE SHOUTS THAT WHEN HE JIZZES? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M RANDY WEBER. I'M DAMN PROUD TO BE AN -- OH, SON OF A BITCH. OH, MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE, SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'M QUITE THE ACERBIC SOCIAL CRITIC. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT, RANDY WEBER, DAMN PROUD AMERICAN THERE, I DIDN'T REALIZE THE LEVEL OF DESPOTISM OF OBAMA WAS SO GREAT. I'M CONVINCED. LET'S RID OURSELVES OF THE TYRANT.
WE DO NEED TO DO THIS METHODICALLY AND CORRECTLY AND DO IT IN THE RIGHT WAY, SO I DON'T THINK IT'S PRACTICAL THAT WE IMPEACH HIM RIGHT NOW, BUT HE DEFINITELY DESERVES IT.
WAIT. WHAT? HUH? BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME THAT KING GEORGE IS PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. ARE YOU AMERICAN RANDY WEBER OR NOT? PATRICK HENRY DIDN'T SAY, GIVE ME LIBERTY OR IF NOT NOW, IT'S FINE, I UNDERSTAND. WE'RE BUSY. COME ON! DON'T TELL ME YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE ONE LITTLE TYRANT IMPEACHMENT INTO YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE OF NOT PASSING LAWS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE?
I THINK THAT GETS TO BE A BIT OF A DISTRACTION, JUST LIKE THE IMPEACHMENT OF BILL CLINTON DID.
NOTHING WOULD FIRE UP THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRATS MORE THAN AN IMPEACHMENT ACTION. THAT IT WOULD TURN OFF SOME OF THE INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE RIGHT NOW LEANING OUR WAY.
Jon: YEAH, AND ALL THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW ALL THIS TALK OF TYRANNY IS BULL [BLEEPED]. BECAUSE WHEN YOUR MAIN CONCERN ABOUT DEPOSING A TYRANT IS HOW IT WILL AFFECT YOUR PARTY'S CHANCES IN THE UPCOMING MID-TERM ELECTIONS, THAT'S NOT TYRANNY. [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY REPUBLICANS CAN'T IMPEACH OBAMA. THEY CAN'T BEAT HIM IN AN ELECTION. THEY DEFINITELY CAN'T WORK WITH HIM. WHAT'S LEFT DO? USE SNAPCHAT TO DRAW A DONG ON HIS FACE? I MEAN, YEAH, IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. BUT, WHOA, SWIPE IT TO THE LEFT. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IMPEACHMENT, SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTALLY AMERICAN.
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER SAID HE PLANS TO SUE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ON BEHALF OF THE G.O.P.-CONTROLLED CONGRESS.
REALLY? YOU THINK, YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO FLY IN COURT? REALLY? [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. ALL PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO DO IS THROW HIS BRIEFCASE DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY. YOU TURN YOUR NECK. CASE DISMISSED. BOOM. THANK YOU, MIKE BRADY, ATTORNEY AT LAW. I'M OLD. [LAUGHTER] BUT ENOUGH TALK. LET'S GET TO THE ACTION. WHAT ARE WE SUING OBAMA FOR? WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE? THE FAST AND FURIOUS, THE BENGHAZI, THE IRS, THE FLOATING MUSLIM TERRORIST BLIMP? OOPS.
THE SUIT HAS TO DO WITH THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN 2013 POSTPONING THE MANDATE IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THAT REQUIRES LARGE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES.
Jon: WAIT. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. THE G.O.P. IS GOING TO TAKE DOWN OUR DICTATOR IN CHIEF WITH A CIVIL SUIT ACCUSING HIM OF NOT PROPERLY EXECUTING A LAW THEY THEMSELVES HAVE TRIED MORE THAN 50 TIMES TO PARTLY OR COMPLETELY REPEAL? BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL TAKE IT. WHETHER THIS LAWSUIT HAS ANY MERIT, WHETHER IT'S A GOOD CHECK ON EXECUTIVE POWER, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA. BUT AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST TIME THE TWO SIDES WILL BE FORCED TO DEAL WITH EACH OTHER. EVEN IF IT'S THROUGH THEIR LAWYERS. FINALLY WE THE PEOPLE WILL BE REPRESENTED BY OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES' LEGAL REPRESENTATION. AS THE FOUNDING FATHERS ENVISIONED, WHEN THEY WERE TRIPPING ON MUSHROOMS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
