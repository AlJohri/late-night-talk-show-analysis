Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. YESTERDAY AS EVERYONE IS TALKING  ABOUT ELECTION DAY IN ISRAEL,  NO? [ LAUGHTER ] ELECTION DAY IN ISRAEL. WE BRING YOU THE ONGOING  COVERAGE OF CIRCU-DECISION 0773  VOTE -- I GUARANTEE YOU THAT KILLED IN PARK SLOPE. [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU KNOW, ISRAEL'S INCUMBENT  PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU IS AWESOME.
THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER IS  COMMITTED TO THE SAFETY AND  SECURITY OF THE ISRAELI AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE.
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU IS SAY NOTED HAWK.
A SUPERHAWK IN ISRAEL.
A VERY EFFECTIVE LEADER.
ISRAEL HAS ITS OWN TOUGH GUY  HIS NAME IS NETANYAHU. SHALOM THIS, IS CHUCK NORRIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT  COMING. THAT WAS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR  NETANYAHU'S REELECTION. WHAT DEMOGRAPHIC IS THAT  TARGETING? ARDENT ZIONISTS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN  TO THE MOVIES IN 30 YEARS? IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE AN  ENDORSEMENT FROM ANYONE THAT  WOULD DO THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL LESS GOOD OR HAVE A MORE  APPARENT HAIRPIECE.
VOTE FOR BENJAMIN, TERRIFIC  GUY, TERRIFIC LEADER, GREAT FOR  ISRAEL.
Jon: I STAND CORRECTED. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, THE OTHER THING YOU  NEED TO KNOW ABOUT BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU IS THAT BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T THINK HE'S AWESOME.
HE'S INSULTED PRIME MINISTER  BB NETANYAHU.
HE HAS BEEN RUDE TO  NETANYAHU.
OBAMA HAS BEEN CAUGHT ON TAPE  SAYING YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT  BAD, I HAVE TOLL DEAL WITH HIM EVERY DAY.
IF THE PRESIDENT IS THE BEST  FRIEND ISRAEL HAD, WHY DID HE  SNUB THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: I MEAN HE HAD A  SLEEPOVER AND INVITED EVERYONE  EXCEPT NETANYAHU. EVERYONE WAS THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I -- [ LAUGHTER ] CAMERON HAS QUITE THE PACKAGE. AND SINCE BARACK OBAMA CANNOT  STAND ISRAEL'S AWESOME PRIME  MINISTER YOU KNOW WHAT THAT  MEANS.
OBAMA IS NOT A FRIEND OF  ISRAEL.
HE HAS PROPOSED ISRAEL ADOPT  INDEFENSEIBLE BORDERS.
THIS IS THE MOST ANTI-ISRAEL  ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF  THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
Jon: OH, FOR -- ALL OBAMA  DID WAS ON THE SETTLEMENT GENTLY  SUGGEST THEY MAYBE RECONSIDER BUILDING -- YOU KNOW WHAT  TECHNICALLY THAT DOES MAKE HIM  THE MOST ANTI-ISRAEL PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED  STATES I FORGOT TOLL GENTLY  SUGGEST THAT IS NOT ALLOWED. ANYONE WHO OPPOSED OR PUTS DAY  OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF LIGHT  BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND BENJAMIN NETANYAHU OR HIS APRIL GENDA IS  AN ENEMY OF ISRAEL. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHERE SOME  OF ISRAEL'S ENEMIES ARE TURNING  UP.
BIG POLITICAL NEWS OVERSEAS.
DID HE NOT CRUISE TO AN EASY  VICTORY.
THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SIDE  TOUR 60 SEATS EACH IN  PARLIAMENT.
Jon: OH, MY GOD! 60% OF ISRAEL IS ANTISEMITIC. HOW DID THIS SNAP NETANYAHU HAD  CHUCK NORRIS ON HIS TEAM. HOW DID THE CENTER LEFT PULL THE  UPSET? [ LAUGHTER ] DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
