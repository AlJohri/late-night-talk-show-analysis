WE WERE TALKING THIS WEEK ABOUT OUR NATION'S CREDIT RATING. IT WAS DOWNGRADED. IT LED MANY PEOPLE TO POINT THE BLAME IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION.
THE U.S. DEBT WAS DOWNGRADED ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S WATCH.
FIRST DOWNGRADE IN U.S. HISTORY.
THIS IS THE OBAMA DOWNGRADE. HISTORY IS GOING TO REMEMBER THIS AS THE OBAMA DOWNGRADE.
DON'T YOU THINK HISTORY WILL BE A LITTLE MORE CONCERNED WITH  OBAMA'S 2013 INVASION OF MEXICO WHEN HE SEES HIS POWER AND MILITARILY... FOR MORE WE TURN  TO OUR SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY, NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE OBAMA DOWNGRADE, AMERICA'S CREDIT RATING NOW TIED INEXORABLY TO THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES, BARACK OBAMA. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS?
JON, JON, I'M SO DISAPPOINTED. AMERICA FINALLY GETS OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND OUR CREDIT GOES BAD. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ARE YOU... ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT RACISM IS THE CAUSE OF OUR CREDIT DOWNGRADE  BECAUSE THAT...
NEW YORK JON. I'M SAYING THAT AS A BLACK MAN IT'S THE ONE THING I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE LINE UP. YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU SEE A MURDER REPORTED ON THE NEWS, YOU'RE LIKE, PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE BLACK GUY. [LAUGHTER] OH, A WHITE GUY KILLED THAT OLD LADY, YES! [APPLAUSE]
Jon: LARRY, I APPRECIATE THIS SENTIMENT, BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE CELEBRATING AN OLD LADY'S...
I'M NOT FINISHED. LET ME FINISH. ♪ WE DIDN'T SHOOT THAT LADY ♪♪
VERY NICE, VERY NICE.
LOOK, YOU KNOW HOW REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT BLACK STEREOTYPE  TO BRING DOWN OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY FOR A WHILE. THEY KEEP POINTING OUT HOW MUCH HE LIKES BASKETBALL. YEAH, YOU KNOW, THEY CALLED HIS 50th BIRTHDAY A HIP-HOP BARBECUE. WHAT IS THIS? AND NOW CREDIT PROBLEMS? I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID THAT 3:00 A.M. PHONE CALL WAS JUST FROM THE COLLECTION AGENCY.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT BARACK OBAMA NEEDS TO GET AHEAD  OF THE STEREOTYPES THEN TO FIGHT IT?
NO,, NO JON, IT'S TOO LATE. WE'RE IN THE RED. NOW IT'S TIME TO GO BLACKER. OH, YES, NO, JON, UH-UH. WE KNOW WHAT WE GOT DO DO. ALL RIGHT. YOU THINK HE LOOKS LIKE A CORNY WHITE GUY WITH HIS MOM JEAN, AMERICA? HOW YOU LIKE HIM NOW WITH THE CRACK OF HIS ASS? HEY, IF HE'S GOING TO BE LABELED BLACK, THEN HE SHOULD OWN IT, AND WHEN I SAY OWN IT, I MEAN RENT IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY "RENT IT," WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN RENT TO OWN IT, JON. LOOK, IF THERE'S ONE THING BLACK PEOPLE RELATE TO, IT'S CREDIT PROBLEMS. BROTHER'S GOT A LOT OF TRICKS FOR DEALING WITH DEBT. NUMBER ONE, DON'T PAY ON YOUR FIRST NOTICE. CHINA'S NOT GOING TO COME AFTER YOU UNTIL TENTH ONE ANYWAY. WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.
Jon: SO LARRY, EVENTUALLY CHINA WILL SHOW UP AND DEMAND THEIR MONEY.
JON, THAT'S WHEN THE KIDS COME IN. SEND MALIA TO THE DOOR. HAVE HER SAY HER DADDY'S NOT HOME AND LOOK SAD.
Jon: SHE IS ADORABLE. I WILL SAY THAT.
EXACTLY, JON. WE SHOULD USE THAT. BUT IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU CAN ALWAYS OPEN UP A LINE OF CREDIT UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES.
Jon: YES, YES, YOU'RE SUGGESTING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA STEAL SOMEONE'S IDENTITY. THAT'S...
JON, CANADA IS OUR NEIGHBOR, I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST STEALING THEIR IDENTITY. I'M JUST SAYING, IF WE HAPPEN TO BE DIGGING THROUGH THEIR TRASH, STUMBLE UPON SOME PERTINENT SOCIAL SECURITY INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US COVER SOME  ENTITLEMENTS, JUST TO GET US OVER THE HUMP FOR A FEW YEARS, WOULD THAT BE SO BAD? THEY'RE KNOWN FOR THEIR KINDNESS. I'M SURE THEY'D UNDERSTAND AFTER THE FACT.
Jon: LOOK, I DON'T THINK THAT CANADA WOULD NECESSARILY BE  COOL WITH FOOTING OUR MEDICARE BILL. I DON'T.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A SNITCH WOULD SAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO.
ARE YOU SERIOUS, JON? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
Jon: I AM TOTALLY NOT A SNITCH. I'M JUST SAYING, YOU SEEM BLASE ABOUT DEFRAUDING OUR ALLIES.
WHATEVER, JON, I'M JUST OFFERING SUGGESTIONS. I'M NOT THE ONE WHO IS SPEAKING OUT JUST BECAUSE WE OWE SOME PEOPLE SOME MONEY. [DOORBELL RINGS] [LAUGHTER] PARAGRAPH CREDITORS. TURN OFF THE LIGHT! AMERICA'S NOT HERE. JON, IF YOU SNITCH, I WILL CUT YOU.
Jon: WHAT! I'M NOT A SNITCH. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. I'M NOT A SNITCH.
