WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE REIGNING  KING OF JORDAN. WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM KING  BDULL ABDULLAH II.A  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE  AGAIN. I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW AS  AN EMISSARY OF THE UNITED STATES  OUR PRESIDENT, I KNOW, WAS  SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH YOU  TODAY. (LAUGHTER)  HE WAS NOT DOING A STUPID T.V. SHOW. (LAUGHTER)  HE WAS VERY BUSY WITH  STRATEGIC-- MEETINGS. (LAUGHTER)  WHOOPI GOLDBERGSTAN, I BELIEVE  IT IS.
I HEARD.
Jon: THAT THE TALK OF-- YOU  WERE AT THE U.N. TODAY. DOES ANYONE-- IS THERE ANY  DISCUSSION AMONGST WORLD LEADERS  ABOUT THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT NOT  BEING AVAILABLE FOR FACE-TO-FACE  MEETINGS? IS THAT NOT A-- IS THAT  UPSETTING?
NOT THAT I HEARD, NO. I THINK EVERYBODY'S THERE  PREPARING FOR THEIR SPEECHES AND  IN SIDE MEETS WITH OTHER  LEADERS. THAT WAS NOT AN ISSUE.
Jon: SO WE ARE, IN FACT,  PERHAPS, IN SOME RESPECTS  BLOWING THIS OUT OF PROPORTION?
MOST LIKELY, PROBABLY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALTHOUGH INSIDE IT  DOES HURT A LITTLE BIT, DOESN'T  IT? (LAUGHTER)  HOW ARE THINGS? YOU ARE NEIGHBORS WITH-- FOR  SOME PERSPECTIVE WITH OUR  AUDIENCE WHO BELIEVE YOU'RE  SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OF BERMUDA--  (LAUGHTER). YOU ARE BORDERED BY IRAQ,  SYRIA--
YES.
Jon: ISRAEL AND SAUDI  ARABIA.
EGYPT.
Jon: AND EGYPT. SO HOW ARE THINGS? (LAUGHTER)
WE'VE SEEN BETTER DAYS.
Jon: YOU RUN A  CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE  LARGEST DEMOCRATIC I DON'T WANT  TO SAY UPRISING BUT TRANSITION  IN YOUR PART OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU? HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT WITHOUT  BEING DEPOSED LIKE SOME OF THESE  OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HAD TO DEAL  WITH?
JORDAN IS PART OF THE ARAB  SPRING ALSO. BUT THE ARAB SPRING MEANS  SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO EVERY  COUNTRY. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ARE GOING  THROUGH DIFFERENT PACES. YOU KNOW, I KEEP SAYING THAT  WHATEVER THE MIDDLE EAST IS  GOING THROUGH IS GOING TO BE  SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE FIVE, TEN, 15 YEARS AND EACH COUNTRY  IS GOING TO HAVE ITS OWN UNIQUE  EXPERIMENT OF THIS. THE REPUBLICS HAVE GONE THROUGH  A MUCH TOUGHER VERSION OF THIS  THAN THE MONARCHIES, FUNNY  ENOUGH. BUT I HOPE THIS IS SOMETHING WE  ALL LOOK BACK FIVE, TEN, 15  YEARS FROM NOW AND SAY THAT ARAB  SPRING IS A GOOD THING. AND I BELIEVE IT IS. SO WE ALL HAVE TO CHANGE. BUT THE PACE AND MEANING WILL BE  DIFFERENT FOR EACH COUNT VOY THE  PROBLEM SOMETIMES IN THE UNITED  STATES IS THEY SAY "HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE ARAB SPRING? THERE'S NO WAY TO QUANTIFY THAT  BECAUSE FOR EACH COUNTRY IT  MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
Jon: I THINK WE LIKE TO  HAVE THE IDEA-- ARROGANTLY SO--  THAT WE ARE IN CONTROL OF THIS  PROCESS. THE ARGUMENT WE HAVE IS "HOW  COULD YOU LET THE BROTHERHOOD  COME TO POWER IN EGYPT, OBAMA?"  AS THOUGH OBAMA COULD GO "I SHOULD HAVE RIGGED THAT  DIFFERENTLY."  (LAUGHTER)  WE HAVE A SENSE THAT SOMEHOW WE  CAN CONTROL THESE EVENTS BUT EVEN IN THAT REGION, I IMAGINE,  THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF  NERVOUSNESS AMONGST THE GENERAL  RULING PARTIES THAT HAVE BEEN-- YOU KNOW, SAUDI ARABIA PROBABLY  LOOKS AT JORDAN TO SEE HOW  YOU'RE DOING.
WELL, AGAIN, EVERYBODY  COUNTRY IS LOOKING AT EVERYBODY  ELSE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT  ARAB SPRING STARTED WITH A YOUNG  MAN THAT BURNED HIMSELF AND DIED  BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY AND ARAB SPRING STARTED BECAUSE OF THE  ECONOMY AS THE WHOLE WORLD HAS S  REACTING TO THE ECONOMY. YOU HAD WALL STREET OVER HERE  AND THEN IT WENT FROM ECONOMIC  FRUSTRATION TO POLITICS. YOUNG MEN THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE  EAST-- RIGHTLY SO-- ASK FOR  POLITICAL REFORM. WHAT HAPPENED IN A LOT OF  COUNTRIES AS YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN  ASPIRE TO POLITICAL REFORM,  THOSE ORGANIZED LIKE THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, SORT OF HIJACKED  THE MOVEMENT SO IN CERTAIN  COUNTRIES WHEN THEY WENT TO THE  POLL.
Jon: NOW HOW WOULD THEY  FEEL ABOUT THAT TERM IN GENERAL?
BUT IN A WAY THAT'S DEMOCRACY  BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE ORGANIZED. AGAIN, I THINK ONE OF THE  EXAMPLES-- ABOUT A YEAR AGO I  WAS TALKING TO A TOP BRITISH  DIPLOMAT SAYING SHE WAS IN CAIRO TALKING TO A WHOLE GROUP OF  YOUNG EGYPTIAN POLITICIANS  SAYING THIS IS FANTASTIC, WE'RE  ORGANIZED, THERE'S A CHANCE TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY AND ARAB  SPRING IS WONDERFUL FOR US. HERE'S ALL OF US WITH 70 PARTIES  COMING TOGETHER AND SHE SAID  THAT'S THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE 70 AND THEY'RE ONE. BUT THAT'S THE PROCESS OF  DEMOCRACY.
Jon: AND YOU FEEL WHAT WILL  HAPPEN IS THERE WILL BE A  CONSOLIDATION AND FIVE OR SIX  PARTIES THEN THE MORE MODERATE VOICES WILL BECOME STRONGER.
YOU HOPE SO. YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR 200  YEARS.
Jon: AND WE HAVE IT REALLY  PERFECTED. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, IT'S WORTH A TRY. SO IN JORDAN STILL WE HAVE  ELECTIONS AT THE END OF THE  YEAR. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JORDAN  AND OTHER COUNTRIES IS WE  CHANGED THE CONSTITUTION. WE CHANGED A THIRD OF THE  CONSTITUTION, WE DID A LOT OF  THINGS, AND NEW INSPECT  COMMISSIONS FOR ELECTIONS AND THEN WE HAD ELECTIONS. ALL THESE OTHER COUNTRIES--
Jon: YOU WERE LAYING A  FOUNDATION.
THEY WENT TO ELECTIONS AND  NOW HAVE TO CHANGE THE  CONSTITUTION. THE PROBLEM WITH EGYPT, LIBYA,  AND TUNIS IS THEY'VE GOT NEW  GOVERNMENTS IN POWER BUT  MANDATED TO NOW CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION WITHIN A YEAR AND  THEN GO TO ELECTIONS AGAIN. BUT THERE'S BEEN A DELAY IN  ACTUALLY CHANGING THE  CONSTITUTIONS.
Jon: SO IT WASN'T  NECESSARILY A MANAGED TRANSITION  AND THAT COULD BE SLIGHTLY  VOLATILE. STPHAO.
EACH COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH  DIFFERENT THINGS SO YOU CAN'T  PREJUDGE THESE ISSUES.
Jon: WELL, WE'LL TALK A  LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHERE  WORLD WAR III IS GOING TO START,  WHO'S GOING TO START IT. (LAUGHTER)  AND WHERE I SHOULD HIDE. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL BE BACK WITH  MORE FROM KING
