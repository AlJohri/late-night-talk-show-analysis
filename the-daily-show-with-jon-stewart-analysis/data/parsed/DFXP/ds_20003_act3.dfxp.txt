Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE CREATOR AND STAR OF HBO'S  "GIRLS." HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "NOT THAT KIND OF  GIRL: A YOUNG WOMAN TELLS YOU WHAT SHE'S LEARNED." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, LENA DUNHAM. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
HI.
Jon: I LOVE THIS BOOK. YOU'RE A VERY GOOD WRITER.
THANK YOU.
Jon: FUNNY ESSAYS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I VER MUCH ADMIRE ABOUT YOU? YOUR ABILITY AT A YOUNG AGE TO  ARTICULATE MOTIVATIONS OF YOUR  BEHAVIOR THAT EVEN YOU DON'T  -- THAT TO UNDERSTAND YOURSELF  WELL, AND THE REASONS YOU BEHAVE IN WAYS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU END UP BEING SELF-CRITICAL OF OR THINGS LIKE THAT. LIKE, YOUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND  THAT.
WELL, THANK YOU.
Jon: WHERE DOES IT COME  FROM?
PROBABLY IF I HAD A LITTLE MORE OF THAT ABILITY, I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE THINGS IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE NECESSITATED WRITING THIS DISASTROUS TOME.
Jon: POST, POST-ABILITY. NOT AT ALL.
BUT, UMM, WELL, I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF THERAPY.
Jon: OH.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS  YOUR QUESTION. IT'S DEFINITELY A PART OF THE EQUATION.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I JUST, I HAVE THIS SENSE THAT IF I DON'T MAKE SOME SORT OF -- IF I DON'T MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THESE EVENTS THEN THEY HAPPENED IN VAIN, AND I MIGHT AS WELL JUST, YOU KNOW, GO BURY MYSELF IN A YARD.
Jon: IS IT THAT WHEN YOU ARE, SO, WHEN YOU WERE OUT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, WERE YOU ALWAYS IN SOME WAYS OBSERVING YOURSELF AS YOU WERE IN THESE SITUATIONS? OR IS THIS ALL KIND OF A POST  MORTEM ON THESE EVENTS?
I WISH IT WAS MORE OF A  POST MORTEM. I MEAN, ONE OF MY, ONE OF THE LIKE PRIMARY CRITICISMS THAT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE HAVE OF ME IS LIKE YOU HAVE JUST GONE INTO THAT GLAZED PLACE WHERE I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND LIKE KIND OF LIKE MOVING THE DETAILS AROUND IN YOUR HEAD AND DECIDING THAT THIS IS A SCENE, AND IT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE WE'RE PEOPLE AND WE'RE HERE RIGHT NOW. SO, I TRY TO FIGHT THAT, BUT IT'S  CHALLENGING.
Jon: PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE DO KNOW THAT? THEY'LL SAY, OH YOU'RE WRITING THIS DOWN, AREN'T YOU?
MY DAD 100% KNOWS THIS. LIKE, HE'S LIKE,  YOU'RE GETTING DISASSOCIATEIVE  HERE. HE'S GOT A THING HE SAYS WHERE HE LOOKS AT ME AND IS LIKE, NO, DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.
Jon: AND, I'M AMAZED. AND HE'S STILL ENGAGED IN  THAT WAY. LIKE, I'M A DAD, AND I CHECKED OUT LIKE THREE YEARS AGO. LIKE THAT'S, THAT'S AWESOME.
HE'S LIKE TOO ENGAGED.
Jon: OH REALLY?
HE CALLED ME LIKE SEVEN TIMES ON THE WAY HERE. I MEAN, HE'S MY FAVORITE. SO IT'S WORKING OUT FINE BUT --
Jon: WAIT, DOES YOUR MOM KNOW  THAT?
SHE'S MY OTHER FAVORITE. THEY CURRY FAVOR AT DIFFERENT TIMES. TODAY MY DAD'S REALLY GREAT, BUT YESTERDAY MY MOM WAS KIND OF WORKING OUT BETTER FOR ME.
Jon: OKAY. DO YOU USE THAT COMPETITION TO  YOUR ADVANTAGE? BECAUSE I COULD THINK THAT WOULD -- I MEAN  --
I CAN'T REMEMBER EVER EXCEPT ONCE WHEN I WAS LITTLE.
Jon: YEAH.
IN THE SUPERMARKET MY MOM SAID I COULDN'T HAVE A TOY. AND I WALKED OVER TO MY DAD AND WAS LIKE MOM SAID I COULD HAVE IT, AND I GOT IT, AND WAS LIKE, OH THAT WORKS GREAT. THAT'S A THING YOU CAN DO.
Jon: THE LESSON THERE IS LIE OUT OF EAR SHOT.
YEP. TOTALLY.
Jon: OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I'M VERY IMPRESSED BY YOU WITH? IS YOU TAKE MORE CRITICISM, AND MORE VITRIOLIC CRITICISM THAN ALMOST ANY PERFORMER AND WRITER I'VE EVER SEEN, AND YOU HANDLE IT WITH A GRACE THAT BELIES THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT IS COME YOUR WAY. AND I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO  FATHOM, BECAUSE I THINK YOUR  WORK IS REALLY SPECIAL, REALLY  INTERESTING, REALLY FUNNY. YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON. I DON'T GET IT. DO YOU, DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT? HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF IT?
WELL, THANK YOU FOR SAYING  THAT. I AM, I CALLED GILBERT GOTTFRIED, AND HE OFFERED ME A LOT OF SUPPORT ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE, YOU KNOW...
Jon: YES.
LIFE IN THE SPOTLIGHT, AND I FEEL REALLY EQUIPPED NOW. NO, I, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT CAN DEFINITELY BE CHALLENGING.
Jon: YEAH.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE SORT OF YOU KNOW WRITING IN YOUR ROOM AND DREAMING OF THIS CAREER THAT YOU NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT, AS LIKE I'M GOING TO HAVE A TV SHOW, AND I'M GOING TO WRITE A BOOK AND EVERYONE IS GOING TO HATE ME IN THE INTERNET. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE, IT THIS DOUBLE EDGED SWORD OF LIKE YOU HAVE THIS GIFT OF PEOPLE PAYING SERIOUS ATTENTION TO YOUR WORK, AND I FEEL SO LUCKY ABOUT THAT, AND IT'S GIVEN ME THIS SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN MY LIFE THAT I NEVER IMAGINED I'D HAVE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO I HAVE, IF I HAVE TO KIND OF TAKE THE BAD WITH THE GOOD, I TRY TO REACT. MY, MY MOTTO WOULD BE, I TRY TO REACT WITH CLASS AND A LITTLE BIT OF SASS. I HAVEN'T TESTED THAT ONE OUT  ON ANYONE YET.
Jon: THAT RHYMES, SO I WOULD GO WITH THAT. BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH DOUBLE GUNS. I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH JUST LIKE A PICTURE ON THE INTERNET OF ME JUST LIKE BOOM!
THERE HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN TIMES WHEN I'VE BEEN TEMPTED.
Jon: YEAH.
BUT I KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T ALSO ELICIT THE DESIRED RESULT,
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEN YOU END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS LIKE CRAZY GNOME THROWING ROCKS OUT OF A CAVE AT THE CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE. AND I CAN'T DO THAT.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING THOUGH?
YEAH.
Jon: THAT SHOULD BE YOUR  NEXT SHOW. JUST CALL IT GNOMES. AND IT'S JUST GNOMES.
THERE'S THIS CLASSY SASSY GNOME WHO JUST THROWS STUFF OUT OF A CAVE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! BUT IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU ALSO, YOU CHART THAT GROWTH. WHEN I WATCH THE SHOW, IN SOME RESPECTS, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING A VERSION  OF -- A LESS ACTUALIZED  VERSION OF YOU.
WELL THAT SORT OF, I ALWAYS SORT OF -- THANK YOU AGAIN.
Jon: YEAH.
BUT I ALWAYS SORT OF THINK OF MY CHARACTER ON THE SHOW AS BEING SORT OF ME, LIKE TWO AND A HALF YEARS BEHIND.
Jon: OH OKAY.
SO IT'S FUN. I'M LIKE GETTING TO SAY, LIKE TO SAY ALL THE STUFF I WISH I'D SAID IN THE MOMENT, AND HANDLE THE  SITUATION SLIGHTLY BETTER. WHICH MEANS THAT I -- IN THE FIRST INSTALLMENT, MUST HAVE HANDLED THE SITUATION PRETTY BADLY BECAUSE MY CHARACTER IS A TOTAL ASSHOLE. BUT I REALLY -- I LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF LIKE GO BACK AND AS YOU SAID, DO THE POST MORTEM ON THE THINGS I'VE BEEN THROUGH.
Jon: YEAH.
I GOT TO DO IT ON THE SHOW. THE BOOK IS A REALLY DIFFERENT WAY OF GOING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU GET TO HAVE THIS REALLY INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PAGE, AND THIS SORT OF LIKE FIRST PERSON NARRATION AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT MOTIVATIONS, IN A WAY THAT IT WOULDN'T REALLY BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE "GIRLS" AND BE LIKE, AND THEN I LEARNED, BUT -- IN A BOOK, CAN YOU DO THAT.
Jon: WELL, THAT WAS "SEX & THE CITY" I THINK. THEY JUST HAD SOMEBODY TYPE THAT.
AND "SEX & THE CITY," THEY DID IT SO EFFECTIVELY, AND WITH SO MANY PUNS THAT I --
Jon: WITH SASS AND CLASS.
YEAH. WITH SASS AND CLASS.
Jon: YES, WELL, IT'S, IT'S EXCELLENT. I WISH YOU NOTHING BUT THE BEST. I MEAN, THIS IS, IT'S A TERRIFIC PIECE MUCH  WORK.
THANK YOU. AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR  MOVIE.
Jon: THANK YOU.
I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
Jon: I HEAR GOOD THINGS. [ APPLAUSE ] "NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. AND THE NEW SEASON OF "GIRLS" IS WHAT? >>THE NEW SEASON OF "GIRLS" COMES OUT IN JANUARY.
Jon: JANUARY. LENA DUNHAM.
