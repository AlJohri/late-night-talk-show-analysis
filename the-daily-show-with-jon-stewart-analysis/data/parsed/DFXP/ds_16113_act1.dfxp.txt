SEPTEMBER 8, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS DALE DILL WITH JON STEWART. -- THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD GUEST TONIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY GUEST TONIGHT -- MY GUEST TONIGHT VERY TALENTED ACTRESS ACTRESS IS, VERY TALENTED MARION  COTILLARD WHICH IS FRENCH FOR MARION COTILLARD. [ LAUGHTER ] [CLEARING THROAT] [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE BEST FRAT PARTY TONIGHT EVER. [ LAUGHTER ] OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED HIS MUCH ANTICIPATED JOBS PLAN. WE'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT ON MONDAY WHEN YOU NO LONGER GIVE A (bleep). BUT, LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A STORY YOU CARED ABOUT LAST NIGHT. THE REPUBLICAN JOBS PLAN RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE INDECISION 2012 THE GREAT WHITE HOPE. THE HAAJ TO THE RONALD REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY. THEY SCARED OFF AGAINST THEIR MORTAL ENEMY MSNBC. IT'S NOT LIKE MISS NEEB IS IS GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO THEM. NO WAIT, DON'T START THE ENGINE, NO-OOOO. WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING? MADDOW! [ LAUGHTER ] OBVIOUSLY WE'RE STILL MONTHS AWAY -- WE'RE MONTHS AWAY FROM  THE PRIMARY AND CAKOUSES IT'S THE FIRST DEBATE OF FALL SEASON. MANY PEOPLE STARTING TO TUNE IN. THE CANDIDATES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING THEM INTO THE VOTERS.
I'M A MOM. I'VE RAISED FIVE BIOLOGICAL KIDS AND 23 FOSTER KIDS. ONE THING I KNOW KIDS NEED --
LOVE, LOVE, STRONG PARENTING.
KIDS NEED JOBS.
Jon: JOBS? THE LESSON YOU LEARN AS A MOTHER IS THAT CHILDREN NEED EMPLOYMENT. SO THE 23 FOSTER CHILDREN YOU "TOOK IN" --  [ LAUGHTER ] WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER YOU BEGAN MANUFACTURING iPHONE PARTS? [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY 6:00 A.M. GET YOUR ASSES DOWN TO THE SAWLDERRING --ED SERRING ROOM I MEAN CRAFT NOOK. NOT A GOOD NIGHT AS EVEN HER PATRIOTIC BROACH HAD THOUGHTS ABOUT HER ANSWERS. I BELIEVE THAT IS THE FLAG PIN EQUIVALENT OF [MAKING SCOOBY DOO NOISES] HOW WOULD JON HUNTSMAN, THE SECOND MOST POPULAR, HAND SOME MORMON EXGOVERNOR IN THE FIELD. HOW WOULD HE DISTICK HIM HIMSELF.
THE PARTY IN THE STAGE IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING ANTISCIENCE. WHO IS ANTISCIENCE?
WHAT YOU MAKE COMMENTS THAT FLY IN THE FACE OF WHAT 98 CLIMATE SCIENTISTS HAVE SAID, WHEN YOU CALL INTO QUESTION EVOLUTION, ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IN ORDER FOR THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY TO WIN, WE CAN'T RUN FROM SCIENCE.
Jon: HOW CAN YOU DENY THE SCIENCE OF EVOLUTION. WITH MY SCIENCE ANSWER YOU JUST SAW WE DISSOLVE INTO SOMEONE WITH NO CHANCE OF WINNING THE  REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. THEY'LL NEVER ACCEPT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL WHO IS SEEMINGLY KNOWING THAT HIS OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK WOULD BE SCARCE.
THESE TSA AGENTS ARE ABUSIVE. SOMETIMES THEY THEY ARE ACCUSED OF ALL KINDS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITIES. AIR CONDITIONING OUT OF GREEN ZEN, THE TROOPS NEED COME HOME. I COULD GET YOU A DMOON OF GASOLINE FOR A DIME. WE COULD SECURE THE BORDERS A BARBED WIRE FENCE WITH MACHINE GUNS. THAT WOULD DO THE TRUCK TRICK. -- DO THE TRICK. I DON'T BELIEVE THATyM IS WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT. I BELIEVE THIS FENCE BUSINESS IS DESIGNED TO KEEP US IN.
Jon: THIS IS WHY WE NEED THIS GUY IN THE RACE. HE IS THE ONLY GUY IN ANY POLITICAL PARTY WHO REALIZED AT SOME POINT WE MIGHT WANT TO  SNEAK INTO MEXICO. I DON'T KNOW IF CONGRESSMAN PAUL --  [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T KNOW IF HE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT OR HAVE ANY KIND OF POWER, BUT I LIKE HIM AS OUR  IDEA GUY. HE GENERATES A LOT OF IDEAS. HE COULD BE LIKE AMERICA'S KRAMER. DO WE REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO EIGHT DIFFERENT PEOPLES IDEAS. THERE'S A SIMPLER METHOD OF VIEWING THIS AUDITION FOR THE MOST POWERFUL JOB IN THE COUNTRY.
PERRY VERSUS ROMNEY, G.O.P. DEBATE.
HOW HOT DOES IT GET BETWEEN RICK PERRY AND MITT ROMNEY.
EIGHT PEOPLE ON THE STAGE WE'RE REALLY ONLY PAYING ATTENTION TONIGHT TO TWO.
Jon: THANK YOU. I KNEW I COULD IGNORE THOSE OTHER PEOPLE. BY THE WAY, I KNOW IT WAS A PREVIEW. WHAT DID HAPPEN?
MITT ROMNEY AND RICK PERRY KICKING IT UP A NOTCH.
MITT ROMNEY AND RICK PERRY WENT AT IT.
MITT ROMNEY AND RICK PERRY GO FACE TO FACE.
IT WAS NOTHING BUT FIRE.
IT WAS EXACTLY THE THING YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S ONLY TWO EXPLANATIONS HOW THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. ONE FOUR MONTHS BEFORE ANY VOTE IS CAST. YOU DECIDE THE NOMINATION IS DOWN TO ROMNEY AND PERRY. FRAME THE DEBATE BY PITTING THE TWO AGAINST EACH OTHER OR YOUR PRECOGS. I'LL LET THE AUDIENCE AT HOME DECIDE. [ LAUGHTER ]
GOVERNOR ROMNEY, YOUR PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE AS GOVERNOR  PERRY'S STRATEGIST RECENTLY PUT IT CONSISTED OF BEING QUOTE A BUY OUT SPECIALIST. YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?
GOVERNOR PERRY YOU CLEARLY DON'T LIKE THE MASSACHUSETTS PLAN AS AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER STATES.
GOVERNOR PERRY A 30 SECOND REBUTTAL.
GOVERNOR --
GOVERNOR PERRY HE SAID YOUR STATE IS FILLED WITH STEERS AND QUEERS, FEEL FREE TO ANSWER IN  THE FORM OF PUNCHING. [ LAUGHTER ] MY FAVORITE MOMENT OF DEBATE CAME FROM NIECE NEWS AND THEIR -- NBC NEWS AND THEIR DECISION TO DO. THIS I WANT TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER COLLEAGUE OF OURS FROM OUR SISTER NETWORK TELEMUNDO.
PLEASE TELL ME HE DIDN'T BRING OUT A LATINO TO ASK A LATINO BASED QUESTION.
LET ME TALK ABOUT A SUBJECT DEAR TO THE HEART OF PRESIDENT REAGAN WHICH WAS IMMIGRATION REFORM. [ LAUGHTER ] (bleep).
Jon: CAN'T WE GO THE WHOLE WAY? CAN'T WE AT LEAST GET A GUY WITH AN ACCENT. I SHALL DIRECT MY FIRST IMMIGRATION QUESTION --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- TO GRINGO NUMBER ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, ALL RIGHT, HE'S OUT HERE. HE'S OUT HERE NOW. WE'RE HAVING THE DEBATE. AT LEAST THEY LET THE GUY JOIN THE CONVERSATION.
TO MY COLLEAGUE JOSE DIAZ.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, YES, SO SOON. I WILL LEAVE, SURE. OKAY. YES, YOU'RE RIGHT I GOT MY ANSWER ON IMMIGRATION. AND I WOULD STAY BUT OBVIOUSLY --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- THERE IS NO THIRD CHAIR. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND
