FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WE HAVE MADE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT BY HAND. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE LIFETIME SHOW "UNDER THE GUNN" ONE OF OUR FAVORITES, MR. TIM GUNN WILL BE JOINING US A LITTLE BIT LATER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIRST LIKE A CAR UNABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON ITS WAY TO FORT LEE, NEW JERSEY, WE -- [LAUGHTER] -- AS A NATION REMAIN STUCK IN THE NEWS TRAFFIC JAM THAT IS CHRISTOPHER CHRISTIE.
NEW EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE COMING OUT TODAY ON WHAT MANY ARE NOW CALLING BRIDGEGATE.
CAN THE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR RECOVER FROM THE BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL.
CHRIS CHRISTIE BRIDGEGATE PROBE.
Jon: BRIDGEGATE -- FIRST OF ALL, BRIDGEGATE? COME ON! DOES EVERY SCANDAL HAVE TO GET A GATE? WATERGATE WAS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANIMAL. IT WAS A PETTY CRIME OF POLITICAL INTRIGUE BY AN INCUMBENT ALREADY CRUISING TO AN EASY REELECTION VICTORY. IT WAS AN ENFORCED ERROR WHERE THE COVERUP WAS ACTUALLY MORE DAMAGING -- [LAUGHTER] THIS IS NO WATERGATE. THIS IS ABOUT A -- [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT THE POINT IS:  NOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CHRIS CHRISTIE THE HUNT FOR CHRISTIE SCANDALS IS ON. THERE'S BLOOD IN THE WATER IN NEW JERSEY BUT THIS TIME IT'S NOT COMING OUT OF USED SYRINGES OR DISCARDED TEAMSTERS.
JERSEY CITY CITY MAYOR, STEVE FULOP, A DEMOCRAT, CONSIDERED ENDORSING CHRISTIE FOR REELECTION LAST YEAR BUT DECLINED TO DO SO ON JULY 18. OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS CHRISTIE APPOINTEES CANCELED UPCOMING MEETINGS WITH HIM. FULOP TRIED TO RESCHEDULE BUT WAS IGNORED. HE BELIEVES IT WAS PAYBACK.
Jon: OOH, OOH, I HAD A SCHEDULED MEETING, RENDEZVOUS AND IT WAS POSTPONED. OH, THE PAIN. LISTEN MAYOR, THAT MAY COUNT AS PAYBACK ON DOWNTON ABBEY -- [LAUGHTER] THIS IS NEW JERSEY, PAYBACK IS WAKING UP DUCT TAPED TO THE ROOF OF THE HOLLAND OPPORTUNITY DURING THE FRIDAY AFTERNOON RUSH-HOUR. NOT OOH, I WAS GOING TO MEET THEM AND THEN THEY SAID WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW? [LAUGHTER] NOW SOME HAVE CLAIMED THAT ALL OF THIS -- DO YOU LIKE THAT? HOW COULD YOU NOT? HOW COULD YOU NOT? [LAUGHTER] SOME HAVE CLAIMED THAT ALL OF THIS, THE BRIDGE SHUTDOWN, THE LEANING ON MAYORS IS PROOF THAT OLD GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HERE IS A BIT OF A BULLY BUT ON FOX ONE MAN WAS SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THROUGH ALL THAT.
WHAT ABOUT THIS BULLY NARRATIVE?
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IN THIS SORT OF FEMINIZED ATMOSPHERE --
Jon: FEMINIZED ATMOSPHERE -- OF NEW JERSEY? THE STATE WHOSE CHIEF EXPORTS ARE AXE BODY SPRAY AND LIT FARTS? THAT? THAT ATMOSPHERE? OR DO YOU MEAN THE FEMINIZED ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH WE ALL HAVE TO COEXIST WITH EACH OTHER.
MEN TODAY HAVE LEARNED THE LESSON THE HARD WAY THAT IF YOU ACT LIKE AN OLD FASHIONED GUY'S GUY YOU ARE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF SLIPPING OUT AND SAYING SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA GET YOU IN TROUBLE, AND MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A SEXIST OR MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SEEM THUGGISH OR WHATEVER.
Jon: AH, SO BULLIES, THUGS, AND SEXISTS ARE THE REAL VICTIMS HERE. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR NOT VERY LONG. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS WHY THIS IDEA THAT THE REAL TRAGEDY IN THIS ENTIRE SITUATION IS THE OVERLY PC VAGINA-FICATION OF AMERICA. AND THAT THOUGHT FOUND A COMFORTABLE HOME ON THE FOX  NEWS NETWORK.
I THOUGHT YOUR ANALYSIS OF  THE TOUGH GUY FACTOR WAS RIGHT ON, HUME.   OF COURSE I WOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE I'M A BIG TARGET AS WELL.
IF YOU HAVE THAT TOUGH GUY IMAGE YOU SPEAK BLUNTLY, EVEN SOMETIMES RUDELY, ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE ON CERTAIN INTERESTS, TEACHER'S UNION IN CHRIS CHRISTIE'S CASE YOU DO RUN THE RISK OF BEING A BULLY.
Jon: LISTEN TO HOW WISTFUL THEY ARE FOR THE OLD DAYS. THEY ARE LIKE THE WILFORD BRIMLEYS OF SEXISM. [LAUGHTER] IT USED TO BE IN THE OLD DAYS, NEIGHBORS WOULD LEAVE THE DOORS OPEN  AND PEOPLE SAID THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU. AND A GOOD MEAL COST A DOLLAR. AND HELL, YOU COULD GRAB A WOMAN'S BREASTS AND SAY, "TUNE IN TOKYO," AS IF SHE WERE A RADIO BUT I SUPPOSE TIMES HAVE CHANGED. [LAUGHTER] HOW WOULD IT BE THEN, IF THIS IS ABOUT THE FEMINIZATION OF AMERICA THAT THE TOUGHEST POLITICIAN OUT THERE OTHER THAN CHRIS CHRISTIE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN.
POLITICAL MAGAZINE OUT WITH A PIECE CALLED HILLARY'S HIT LIST. A LIST OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES RANKING THEM ON A 1-7 SCALE WITH ONE BEING HELPFUL AND 7 BEING QUOTE, TREACHEROUS.
Jon: TURNS OUT YOU DON'T NEED A DICK TO BE A DICK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND YOU DON'T SEE -- YOU DON'T SEE HER PARTISANS CRYING GENDER POLITICS.
WOULD WE NOT BE TALKING ABOUT THIS IF THIS WAS A MAN INVOLVED HERE?
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE. IF A GUY HAS A LIST OF PEOPLE HE IS NOT TOO KEEN ON NO BIG DEAL. IF A WOMAN DOES THEN IT'S A BIG DEAL AND THEN IT BECOMES JUICY.
Jon: OH, FOR (bleep) SAKE. DO I HATE OUR NEWS MEDIA. YES, WE NEVER TALK ABOUT A MALE POLITICIAN'S ENEMIES LIST. THE PRESIDENT STILL BULLYING THE SUPREME COURT AND ADDING TO HIS NIXONIAN ENEMIES LIST.
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS BEEN MAINTAINING AN ENEMY'S LIST OF ITS OWN.
THE POLICE FOUNDATION THE COUNTRY'S LEADING THINK TANK  ON EFFECTIVE AND JUST POLICE WORK IS ON THE NRA'S ENEMIES LIST.
DURING THE WATERGATE INVESTIGATION THE PRESIDENT NOT ONLY BUGGED THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE BUT IT ALSO CREATED ENEMIES LIST.
Jon: WOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENEMIES LIST AND IT'S KIND OF NEWS WORTHY NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE MAN OR WOMAN. SHOULD I HAVE AN ENEMIES LIST? I DO. ONE WORD:    DAIRY YOU HAVE (bleep)ED ME FOR THE LAST TIME.
