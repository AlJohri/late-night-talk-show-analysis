Jon:  WELCOME BACK. SO, WHEN WE LAST LEFT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE APPLE MUFFIN. ( LAUGHTER ) A WEEK AFTER THE N.B.A. SAID IT WOULD TRY TO FORCE L.A. CLIPPERS OWNER DONALD STERILING TO SELL HIS TEAM, THE FRANCHISE HAS NO SHORTAGE OF WEALTHY SUITORS.
OPRAH WINFREY SAYS SHE'S INTERESTED IN BUYING THE CLIPPERS, PARTNERING WITH DAVID GEFFEN AND ORACLE OWNER LARRY ELLISON.
THEN THERE'S RAPPER RICK ROSS.
SEAN P. DIDDY COMBS.
FRANKIE MUNIZ.
MATT DAMON.
EVEN BOXERS, FLOYD MAYWEATHER, OSCAR DELA HOYA.
MAGIC JOHNSON CONFIRMING HE'S A POTENTIAL BUYER AS WELL.
Jon:  WOW, THAT IS AN ECLECTIC GROUP OF INVESTORS. OR THE WEIRDEST AWARD SHOW LINEUP EVER. LIKE A RANDOM CELEBRITY NAME GENERATOR. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEALTHY DILETTANTE IN AMERICA WANTS TO BUY THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS. NOW,
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMEONE, JON? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN HODGMAN.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE L.A. CLIPPERS FOR A SPIN.  ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon:  COME AND SIT DOWN.
OKAY.
Jon:  ARE YOU TRYING TO BUY THE CLIPPERS FROM 1972?
OH, I LIKE TO GET, I LIKE TO LET THE BOYS BREATHE, YOU KNOW.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE TO BUY THE CLIPPERS, JON, BECAUSE I, OBVIOUSLY, OWN THE CALVES ALREADY.
OOOOOH!
Jon:  I HOPE WE WHITE BALANCE THE SCREEN TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
I'M BLOWING OUT FLAT SCREENS ALL OVER AMERICA.
Jon: YOU ARE BLOWING OUT-- YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SHOULD TRY AND -- IT'S GRADE A LEG MEAT. YOU WANT TO MOVE THAT OFF THE THING THERE? WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST IN BASKETBALL, IF YOU WILL?
OH, I DON'T CARE ABOUT BASKETBALL. BUT OWNING A SPORTS TEAM IS THE LAST REMNANT OF CAPITALISM'S GOLDEN AGE, WHEN OWNERS CONTROLLED EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR WORKERS' LIVES AND AS AN OLIGARCH AMERICAN IT'S TIME I ACQUIRED MY OWN HERD OF HUMANS ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon: YOU, YOU,  I THINK YOU HAVE THE WRONG IDEA HERE. YOU JUST OWN A TEAM, BUT IT'S NOT, YOU DON'T OWN THE HUMANS. THEY PLAY ON IT.
OH, SO YOU'RE SAYING I AND MY WEALTHY FRIENDS WON'T TAKE TURNS SELECTING WHICH OF THESE YOUNG MEN WE WANT? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  AH... TECHNICALLY, THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD DO. THAT'S HOW THE DRAFT WORKS. BUT IT'S NOT--
BUT, I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD NEVER ARRANGE A  PUBLIC INSPECTION OF THEIR BODIES' STRENGTH AND AGILITY. YES OR NO. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: THEY DO-- THEY DO SCOUT PLAYERS IN THAT MANNER IN SOME REGARD.
OH, I SEE. WELL, OBVIOUSLY, ONCE I DRAFT THEM, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DICTATE THEIR HOME CITY?
Jon:  YOU PROBABLY WOULD BE ABLE TO DICTATE THEIR HOME CITY.
OK, SO TO RECAP I TAKE THEM FROM THEIR HOMES AND COMPEL THEM TO PERFORM PHYSICAL FEATS FOR MY PLEASURE AND PROFIT IN A PLACE OF MY CHOOSING AND WHEN I TIRE OF THEM I CAN TRADE THEM WITH MY WEALTHY FRIENDS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. IS THAT RIGHT, JON? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  YOU KNOW, THIS IS REALLY-- THIS IS REALLY WHY I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE THE BEST CANDIDATE TO MOVE THE CLIPPERS, PAST THE LEGACY OF DONALD STERLING.
MOVE PAST THE LEGACY? WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?
Jon:  WELL, HE'S A RACIST AND BEING STRIPPED OF HIS TEAM IN DISGRACE.
A TEAM THAT HE BOUGHT FOR $12 MILLION THAT HE'S NOW BEING FORCED TO SELL FOR OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. JON, THAT'S NOT DISGRACE. THAT'S A BUSINESS MODEL. AND, I CAN DO BETTER. IF HE CAN MAKE HALF A BILLION BY BEING SECRETLY RACIST, IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE I'LL MAKE WITH THE CLIPPERS BY BEING OPENLY RACIST.
Jon: NO, I DON'T, I DON'T, I DON'T THINK YOUR MOSTLY BLACK BASKETBALL TEAM IS GOING TO APPRECIATE THAT STANCE.
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. I'M GOING TO FIRE ALL THE BLACK PLAYERS. DAY ONE. I'M TAKING THE CLIPPERS ALL WHITE.
Jon:  SORRY, SAY THAT AGAIN?
ALL WHITE. YOU KNOW. LIKE MITT ROMNEY BUYING MAYONNAISE ON HIS WAY TO A COLDPLAY CONCERT.
Jon:  I THINK IF YOU DO THAT TO THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS, LOS ANGELES WILL TEAR YOU APART.
OH, JON I'LL ALREADY BE LONG GONE. I'M MOVING THE TEAM TO MASSACHUSETTS, BIRTHPLACE OF CAUCASIAN BASKETBALL. PEOPLE OF NEW ENGLAND, MEET THE NEWEST N.B.A. FRANCHISE, YOUR BOSTON WHITE SKINS!
Jon:  YOU CAN'T-- JON, YOU CAN'T GET-- ( LAUGHTER ) YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH A NAME LIKE THAT.
OH, I SEE SO AMERICAN INDIANS CAN HAVE A TEAM NAMED AFTER THEIR SKIN COLOR BUT WHITES CAN'T? WELL, THAT'S REVERSE RACISM, JON. THAT'S OFFENSIVE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon: REDSKINS AREN'T THE NATIVE AMERICANS' TEAM AND THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE THE NAME, SO IT'S NOT.
WELL, MAYBE THEY WOULD LIKE IT MORE IF THEY HAD A LOVEABLE MASCOT LIKE OURS. MEET SKINNY THE SKINHEAD. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  IS THAT-- IS THAT JUST-- IS THAT A MR. METZ HEAD?
YEAH. WE JUST PAINTED OUT THE LACES AND PUT IT ON A SKINHEAD.
Jon:  ISN'T THAT WHAT KEEPS HIS BRAINS IN, THOUGH?
YOU SEE, JON, AT THIS RATE, I'LL BE FORCED TO SELL THE TEAM BEFORE THEY SET FOOT ON THE COURT. I JUST NEED ONE MORE THING TO OUT-STERLING STERLING. JON, COULD YOU RECORD ME SAYING SOME RACIST THINGS AND THEN LEAK THAT TO THE PUBLIC?
Jon:  UH, I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE, JOHN. I THINK, UH.
OH, GREAT. GO, WHITESKINS!
Jon:  ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHITE POWER!
Jon: JOHN HODGEMAN, EVERYBODY. THAT'S THE WRONG-- THAT'S THE WRONG PHRASE FOR YOUR TEAM. NO, YOU DON'T WANT, YOU DON'T WANT A TEAM LIKE THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
