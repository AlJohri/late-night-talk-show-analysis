Jon: WELCOME BACK. BARACK OBAMA FIRST INAUGURATION  IN 2009, HIS INAUGURATION WAS AN  HISTORIC EVENT. HOW DID YESTERDAY'S COMPARE TO  SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN TO SPHWHOAJ  JOHN OLIVER REPORTS.
FOUR YEARS AGO TWO MILLION  PEOPLE WERE ON THE NATIONAL MALL  TO WITNESS THE HISTORIC INAUGURATION OF BARACK OBAMA. AND I WAS THERE. YES! AND NOW FOUR YEARS LATER, I HAD  RETURNED. I'M RIGHT BACK HERE IN EXACTLY  THE SAME SPOT AS LAST TIME! THE ATMOSPHERE, THE ENERGY HERE  IS ELECTRIC. [ LAUGHTER ] WE CAN MOVE CLOSER. WE CAN WALK CLOSER THAN THIS. LET'S JUST WALK. OKAY. SO IT WAS OFF TO A SLOW START. WE HAVE HAVE THE RIGHT DAY  TODAY, RIGHT? THIS IS IT? WE CAN PICK IT UP. WE CAN REALLY MOVE. I WAS EXPECTING A FEW MORE  PEOPLE THAN THIS.
JUST WAIT AROUND. YOU'LL SEE. THEY COMING.
THIS FEELS A BIT MORE LIKE AN  ULTIMATE FRISBEE SIGNUP. THIS IS NICE.
SLIGHTLY LESS PEOPLE THAN IN  2009 BUT THEY MORE THAN MADE UP  FOR IT WITH ENTHUSIASM. HOW EXCITED ARE YOU TO BE HERE?
I'M TIRED.
YAY!
YAY!
YAY!
LAST TIME IT FELT LIKE AN  HISTORIC EVENT. THIS ONE FEELS MORE LIKE A  CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED  PROCESS.
AH, I WOULD SAY SO.
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THESE  PEOPLE? 2009 THEY UNDERSTOOD THE SCALE  OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.
FOR ME IT'S THE MOST HISTORIC  EVENT THAT IS HAPPENING.
NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER ONE IN TERMS OF  HISTORY OF THE WORLD. IT'S BETTER THAN THE MOON  LANDING, WAY BETTER THAN THE  MOON LANDING.
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT  WEAPON WENT FROM THAT TO THE  45th SHUTTLE RUN IN JUST FOUR  YEARS?
IT FEELS KIND OF EXCITING  NOW. NOT AS EXCITING AS LAST TIME.
IT WASN'T AS EXCITING AS IT  WAS THE FIRST TIME. NORMALLY THE FIRST TIME WHEN YOU  LOVE A WOMAN IT'S NOT THE SAME  WHEN YOU LOVE HER THE SECOND  TIME.
THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE WITH A  WOMAN YOU ARE THINKING I CAN'T  BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.
AND REALITY SETS IN.
AND THE SECOND TIME YOU ARE  THINKING OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE. RATE THIS DAY IN HISTORY.
NOT BAD.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE SIGNING OF  INDEPENDENCE OR ANYTHING LIKE  THANK BUT IT'S STILL HUGE.
NOT THE EMANCIPATION PROK  LAITION.
BUT IT'S BIG, IT'S NUMBER  THREE.
THE BERLIN WALL COMING DOWN  WOULD BE IMPORTANT. IT WAS A HUGE CHANGE.
THE BERLIN WALL WAS MORE  IMPORTANT TO TODAY?
I WOULD SAY.
WHAT IS MORE APPOINTMENT THAN  THIS?
TIGER WOODS WINNING.
PGA TOURNAMENT.
THE FIRST TIME AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN WON A MAJOR  IN GOLF?
YES.
TO BE FAIR IT HADN'T STARTED  YET. ONCE IT BEGAN THEY SOON GET  SWEPT AWAY.
THE 4 4TH PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ABOUT A  BARACK H. OBAMA.
NICE TRY, SCHUMER, WE KNOW  WHAT HIS MIDDLE NAME IS. AND THE WISDOM OF ONE REPORTER  WHO PROVE SIZED THIS SO CLEARLY  BACK IN 2009. IS IT EXCITING? YES! PEOPLE OF COURSE I AM. DO THEY REALIZE IT GLET  ABSOLUTELY NOT. YOU CAN'T CAPTURE LIGHTNING IN A  BOTTLE TWICE. IT WAS AN AMAZING DAY. A MAJOR MOMENT IN U.S. HISTORY. IT WAS JUST SLIGHTLY LESS CATCHY  THAN LAST TIME OBAMA, FIRST  AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT ELECTED FOR THE SECOND TIME! FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT  ELECTED FOR THE SECOND
