FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST IS BOB COSTAS. BOB COSTAS. HE'S GOING TO BE JOINING US ON  THE PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH BIG  NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON. IN THESE RECENT YEARS OF  PERPETUAL WAR OUR MILITARY HAD  TO ADDRESS SOME STANDARD ISSUES IN ORDER TO KEEP ENLISTMENTS UP  THEY'VE LOOSENED THEIR  EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, THEIR "HAVE YOU COMMITTED A FELONY"  REQUIREMENTS. BUT NOW THEY'RE DROPPING THE  BIGGEST BARRIER TO COMBAT ROLES  YET. THE [BLEEP] AND BALLS  REQUIREMENT.
LEON PANETTA ANNOUNCED THE  MILITARY WILL LET WOMEN SERVE IN  FRONT LINE COMBAT UNITS INCLUDING INFANTRY, ARMOR,  ARTILLERY EVEN POTENTIALLY  SPECIAL FORCES
Jon: WOW. FIRST GAYS, NOW WOMEN. WHAT'S NEXT? NONCITIZENS? OH, REALLY? FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE  BOTH THOSE OTHER GROUPS? THE POINT IS TO IT'S A MAJOR  POLICY SHIFT. THERE ARE BOUND TO BE DETRACTORS
THERE ARE CERTAIN ANATOMICAL  FACTS ABOUT UPPER BODY STRENGTH. YOUR 6'4 ," 240 POUND MARINE  YOU'RE INJURED AND YOU NEED THE  MARINE NEXT TO YOU CARRY BACK TO  SAFETY. YOUR THE MARINE NEXT TO YOU IS A  5'4 "WOMEN WHO WEIGHS 115  POUNDS.
Jon: YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE  TONS AND TONS. (MUMBLING) WITH THEIR WEE LITTLE  HANDS AND THEIR WEE LITTLE FEET. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM EAT. THEY PICK UP A DINNER ROLL LIKE  THIS. AND A TINE HE LITTLE SHARP  TEETH. WAIT A MINUTE. I'M THINKING OF MICE. MICE SHOULD NOT BE SERVING IN  THE MILITARY. NO MATTER HOW ADORABLE THEY  MIGHT BE. SERGEANT WHISKERS, I CAN'T  NAPALM YOU. AS FOR THE WOMAN ARE TOO WEAK  EUMENT IT WOULD BE A BAD IDEA TO  SEND THE LINEBACKER TO FIGHT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE PIXIE  REGIMENT. MAYBE THE MILITARY COULD HAVE A  REQUIREMENT PERTAINING TO  PHYSICAL FITNESS. MAYBE A PHYSICAL FITNESS  REQUIREMENT. OF COURSE THAT WON'T ADDRESS THE  REAL PROBLEM OF HAVING WOMEN IN  THE PEELED
BRINGING WOMEN INTO COMBAT IS  INEVITABLY GOING TO CHANGE UNIT  CO-HE'S I HAVE BEENNESS BECAUSE SEX IS INEVITABLE. EROS IS A VERY POWERFUL AND  IRRATIONAL PASSION
Jon: EROS IS A VERY POWERFUL  AND IRRATIONAL PASSION. THAT IS A TERRIBLE ARGUMENT FOR  KEEPING WOMEN OUT OF COMBAT BUT  A WONDERFUL CAMPAIGN FOR A NEW  FRAGRANCE. FOR THE IRRATIONAL PASSION IN  YOU, EROS. I WISH I HAD KNOWN THAT WHEN I  WAS 18. LISTEN. MAYBE YOU PUT A LID ON THIS  SEXUAL MISBEHAVIOR BY AGAIN HAVE  SOME SORT OF STANDARD OR CODE THAT GOVERNS HOW THE MILITARY  CONDUCTS ITSELF. SOME KIND OF A MILITARY CODE OF  CONDUCT, IF YOU WILL. BUT EVEN THAT WON'T ADDRESS THE  BIGGEST HAZARD LADIES PRESENT  OUR FIGHTING MEN.
IF YOU HAD TO GO TO A REST  ROOM, PEE IN A BOTTLE INCHES  FROM THE COMRADE NEXT TO YOU. IF YOU DEVELOP DYSENTERY YOU HAD  TO POOH IN A BAG INCHES FROM  YOUR COMRADE'S FACE. INTRODUCING WOMEN INTO THAT  ENVIRONMENT CAN BE REALLY  TRAUMATIC AND HUMILIATING.
Jon: I'M GOING TO JUMP IN  HERE. FIRST OF ALL, I KNOW A LOT OF  GERMAN BUSINESSMEN WHO WOULD PAY  GOOD MONEY FOR THAT. SECONDLY, YOU'RE IN A WAR ZONE. YOU'RE IN A WAR ZONE AND YOUR  BIG WORRY IS DYING OF  EMBARRASSMENT? AND BY THE WAY, I THINK I  FIGURED SOMETHING OUT HERE. IF MEN ARE GOING TO BE POOHING  INCHES FROM THEIR FEMALE  COMRADE'S FACE, I BELIEVE THAT SOLVES YOUR EROS PROBLEM. EROS IS IRRATIONAL BUT IT'S NOT [BLEEP] CRAZY. ALL RIGHT. OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE EXPLORES  THIS MORE IN DEPTH WITH THIS  REPORT
Reporter: LAST WEEK DEFENSE  SECRETARY LEON PANETTA MADE  MILITARY HISTORY WHEN HE LIFTED THE BAN ON WOMEN SERVING IN  COMBAT. IMMEDIATELY, OBJECTIONS WERE  RAISED.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE  PHYSICALITY OF WOMEN AND MEN
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SEX  ASSAULT PROBLEM
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE  Reporter: AUTHOR AND MILITARY  EXPERT KINGSLEY BROWN
WOMEN IN COMBAT POSITIONS ARE  A THREAT TO MILITARY COHESION. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT MEN CAN  ACTUALLY BOND WITH WOMEN THE WAY  THEY BOND WITH OTHER WOMEN
Reporter: SO WOMEN CAN  DISRUPT ROMANCE IN COMBAT ZONES?
ALMOST BY DEFINITION. Reporter: WHO ARE THESE  FATIGUE HAGS JEOPARDIZING ALL  THAT MILITARY COHESION? MEET MARINE CORPS CAPTAIN ZOE  BIDDLE A PLAINTIFF IN THE  LAWSUIT TO LIFT THE BAN ON WOMEN IN COMBAT
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT  WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO SERVE IN  ALL ROLES
Reporter: WHY DO YOU WANT TO  BE THE ONE TO BREAK UP THE BAND  OF BROTHERS? DON'T BE THE YOKO
UNIT COHESION IS BASED AROUND  COMMON MISSION AND BEING HELD TO  STANDARDS.
Reporter: WE SAID TO AN  EXPERT IN THE WORKPLACE  DISCRIMINATION, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID IN
SURE  Reporter: PICK A NUMBER FROM  ONE TO FOUR
TWO. Reporter: BUT IT TURNS OUT  KINGSLEY HAD A LOT MORE TO SAY.
YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO WOMEN  ADDED TO THE GROUP AND NOW  EVERYBODY IS VYING FOR THEIR ATTENTION
Reporter: WOMEN ARE  DISTRACTING SOME
THEY ARE DISTRACTING. Reporter: WHAT IF THE WOMAN  IS NOT HETEROSEXUAL?
I DON'T THINK THAT IT MATTERS  Reporter: THEY'RE STILL GOING  TO TRY TO HIT THAT
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO TRY TO  HIT THAT
Reporter: I WOULD LOVE TO  TAKE OUT THAT INSURGENT BUT  CHECK OUT MAJOR TURNBULL OVER  HERE. BOING BOING
THAT'S REALLY NOT A FUNNY  THING BECAUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT  CHARGE IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. IT RUINS CAREERS
Reporter: REALLY. RIGHT. SEXUAL HARASSMENT RUINS MEN'S  CAREERS. THERE YOU ARE AT THE FRONT LINES  LOOKING SO CUTE IN YOUR CAMO AND  SOMEONE COMES UP AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTS YOU. AREN'T YOU GOING TO FEEL GUILTY  FOR WRECKING THAT GUY'S CAREER?
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. Reporter: GETTING A LOT OF  BLOW-BACK HERE. DO YOU WANT TO RESCHEDULE THIS  INTERVIEW FOR WHEN YOU'RE NOT  HAVING YOUR PERIOD? SOUNDS LIKE ZOE JUST DOESN'T GET  HOW WOMEN SCREW UP THE  GUY-NAMICS OF ACTUAL COMBAT
THERE HAVE BEEN 280,000 WOMEN  WHO HAVE SERVED IN IRAQ AND  AFGHANISTAN OVER THE LAST  DECADE. OVER 130 WOMEN HAVE DIED IN  THESE WARS. IN MODERN WARFARE THE LINES ARE  BLURRED IF THEY EXIST AT ALL  BETWEEN WHAT THE FRONT LINES ARE AND WHAT IS A SAFE ZONE.
Reporter: DO THEY EVEN CALL  IT THE FRONT LINES ANYMORE?
THEY DO NOT. Reporter: WHAT DO THEY CALL  IT?
AFGHANISTAN. WOMEN ARE BEING SHOT AT. BUT THE MILITARY DIDN'T ALLOW  THEM TO SERVE IN THOSE POSITIONS  OFFICIALLY. THAT HURTS THEIR CHANCES FOR  PROMOTION. FOR EXAMPLE MARY JENNINGS IS A  HELICOPTER PILOT
Reporter: ZOE DISHED THE  DATES ON HER MILITARY GAL PALS
SERGEANT JENNIFER HUNT WAS ON  A CONVOY
Reporter: APPARENTLY THERE  ARE ALREADY TONS OF FEMALE  SOLDIERS TOTALLY KICKING ASS IN COMBAT ZONES.
LEE ANN HESTER RECEIVED THE  SILVER STAR FOR HER ACTIONS  UNDER FIRE
Reporter: YOU GO, GIRL. DO YOU HAVE GIRL TALK IN AFGHAN  STA? LET'S DO A LITTLE ROLE PLAY. I'LL BE A WOMAN WHO SERVED HER  COUNTRY BRAVELY AND I'LL BE YOU. MY NAME IS MAJOR MATTER  JENNINGS. I CHASED GROUND FIRE AFTER MY  HELICOPTER WAS SHOT DOWN
YOU WEREN'T IN THE INFANTRY. YOU WEREN'T TAKING THE FIGHT  WITH 100-POUND PACK
Reporter: A PURPLE [BLEEP] HEART
I SINCERELY SAY THANK YOU FOR  YOUR SERVICE
Reporter: BUT? BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT  YOU SHOULD SERVE IN COMBAT
Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT  POINT. EXCEPT THAT WOMEN ARE ALREADY  THERE, MOTHER [BLEEP]. SEE, IN MY WORLD WOMEN HAVE  ALREADY BEEN SERVING IN COMBAT  FOR TWO WARS, BUT KINGSLEY IS LIVING IN A SIMPLER TIME.
MEN JOIN THE INFANTRY BECAUSE  THEY WANT TO FIGHT
Reporter: EXCUSE ME FOR ONE  SECOND. (MAYBERRY THEME)
GIRLS BECOME WOMEN BY GETTING  OLDER. BOYS BECOME MEN BY ACCOMPLISHING  SOMETHING, BY PROVING SOMETHING
Reporter: HAVE YOU EVER  ACTUALLY MET A WOMAN BEFORE?
SEVERAL. Reporter: A WOMAN WHO DID NOT  WANT TO STRANGLE YOU? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO  ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE  REALLY STUCK IN ANOTHER ERA?
THE GOOD NEWS IS I DON'T HAVE  TO SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE THE  EVIDENCE IS ON MY SIDE. WOMEN HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR  TEN YEARS AND EVENTUALLY WE'LL  JUST KEEP DOING OUR THING
Reporter: WELL SAID. I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE THING  LEFT TO DO. ♪ LOVE LIFT US UP WHERE WE  BELONG ♪♪  ♪ WHERE THE EAGLE FLIES ♪♪  ♪ AND THE MOUNTAINS RISE ♪♪ (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SAM BEE.
