FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE'RE GOING DO THIS RIGHT. OH, LET ME JUST MOVE MY MIC. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE FABULOUS FILMMAKER KEN BURNS. KEN BURNS WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT THE ROOSEVELTS, BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT. ISIS-- ISIL, ISIS-IL, ISOSCELES, THE TERRORIST GROUP CURRENTLY OCCUPYING TWO EQUAL PARTS OF SYRIA AND IRAQ. WHILE WE DON'T AGREE ON WHAT TO CALL THEM, WE ALL AGREE THEY MUST BE STOPPED, AND LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE PRESIDENT WENT ALL IN.
I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT AMERICA WILL LEAD A BROAD COALITION TO ROLL BACK THIS TERRORIST THREAT.
THEY HAVE THIS CORE COALITION OF OF TEN COUNTRIES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO WORK TOGETHER IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO FIGHT ISIS.
Jon: DIFFERENT WAYS. SOME MAY BOMB ISIS. OTHERS MAY SING THEM AWAY. (LAUGHTER) GOOOO.... ISIS... NOOOO... I DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE. AND YET IT IS ANGELIC. BUT OF COURSE THIS BEING PRESIDENT OBAMA HE WAS MET IMMEDIATELY BY A COALITION OF THE KVETCHING.
THIS SO-CALLED BROAD COALITION WHICH IS A COMPLETE FARCE AND FICTION...
JUST IN CONTRAST PRESIDENT BUSH HAD 37 COUNTRIES BEFORE GOING INTO IRAQ.
I THINK THE EFFORT IS PRETTY WEAK AT THIS STAGE.
Jon: THAT LOOKS AWFUL CHRISTIAN-Y.
Jon: GOD, GOD, WHAT A SMARMY ASSHOLE. STEWART VIOLENTLY DISEMBOWELS STEWART DRABBING HIS ENTRAILS THROUGH THE CABLE TELEVISION UNIVERSE FOR ALL TO SEE. I TOOK A MILD JAB AT STEWART. I POKED SOME GENTLE FUN. THAT SEEMS HYPERBOLIC. BUT, YOU KNOW, TEN WESTERN COUNTRIES, WE ARE GOING TO NEED A BROADER EFFORT.
NEARLY 40 NATIONS HAVE NOW AGREED TO JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION.
EGYPT, JORDAN, LEBANON AND IRAQ, KUWAIT, BAHRAIN, SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR, THE UAE AND OMAN.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NOW THAT IS A WHO'S WHO OF MOST OF US DON'T KNOW WHERE. (LAUGHTER) IN YOUR FACE, CRITICS.  I WILL BET THIS BOLD NEW BROAD COALITION HAS SILENCED YOU.
THE COALITION IS NOT A REAL COALITION.
THIS COALITION IS LOOKING DICEY AT BEST.
ENTIRELY UNRELIABLE.
THE COALITION OF THE UNWILLING, THE DISABLED AND THE SELF-INTERESTED.
I UNDERSTAND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO GET A COALITION. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHERE'S THE URGENCY.
Jon: WHO THE [BLEEP] SAYS WHERE IS THE URGENCY? YOU SAID IT! (LAUGHTER) WE PICKED UP 30 COUNTRIES IN THREE DAYS. AT THAT RATE I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF ISIS JOINS THE COALITION. (LAUGHTER) OUT OF PURE PEER PRESSURE. I MEAN WE'RE GETTING A LOT MORE REGIONAL COOPERATION NOW, YEAH?
SEVERAL ARAB NATIONS HAVE OFFERED TO FLY AIR STRIKES AGAINST ISIS.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS SO FAR UNWILLING TO NAME THOSE ARAB PARTNERS.
Jon: OH REALLY? OUR PARTNERS, THEY DON'T WANT TO BE NAMED, HUH? HMM, THAT'S INTERESTING. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU'LL JOIN THE COALITION AS LONG AS NOBODY KNOWS YOU'RE JOINING IT. ON THE DL. JUST AS LONG AS NONE OF YOUR BUDDIES FIND OUT. IT'S LIKE OUR COALITION IS YOUR HOOKUP, THAT YOU PRETEND NOT TO RECOGNIZE AT PARTIES BUT AS ARE YOU WALKING BEHIND US, YOU GO I WILL SEE YOU IN KURDISTAN AT 3 A.M. WELL, GUESS WHAT, GUESS WHAT MISTER,-- WE'LL TAKE IT. ANYTHING THAT HELPS US AVOID ANOTHER MIDDLE EAST WALK OF SHAME. WELL, WHOEVER OUR MYSTERIOUS ARAB PARTNERS ARE AT LEAST WE HAVE A COALITION TO GO TO WAR WITH.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU WANT TO CALL IT A WAR, OR A SUSTAINED COUNTERTERRORISM CAMPAIGN-- .
Jon: IT'S NOT A WAR? I MEAN, I KNOW YOU'RE THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL HEAD BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A WAR WITH ALL THE COALITIONS AND THE TALKING TO THE NATION ON TELEVISION AND THE, ALL RIGHT. HIGH RANKING OBAMA OFFICIAL SAYS NOT A WAR.
WE ARE AT WAR WITH ISIL IN THE SAME WAY WE ARE AT WAR AND CONTINUE TO BE AT WAR WITH AL QAEDA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO IT'S A WAR. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT TO ADMIT IT SOUNDS BETTER, WAR, IMAGINE IF GEORGE LUCAS HAD CALLED HIS MOVIE, STAR SUSTAINED COUNTER-TERRORISM CAMPAIGN. WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME POP. I GOT TO SAY, THOUGH. THE-- IT SOUNDS LIKE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, SOUNDS LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS A LITTLE CONFUSED OVER OUR CURRENT SITUATION VIS-A-VIS WHETHER IT'S A WAR OR NOT. AND HERE'S HOW CONFUSED THEY ARE. YOU CAN GET BOTH POINTS OF VIEW FROM ONE GUY.
IS THE U.S. AT WAR WITH ISIS?
WE'RE ENGAGED IN A MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATION.
NOT A WAR.
AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG-TERM COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATION.
WE'RE AT WAR WITH AL QAEDA AND ITS AFFILIATES AND IN THE SAME CONTEXT, IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, YES, WE'RE AT WAR WITH ISIL IN THAT SENSE.
Jon: I LOVE THAT PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE TONE. HEY, MAN, IF YOU ARE UNHUNG UP ON LABELS -- (LAUGHTER) IF YOU NEED TO CALL IT SOMETHING, I GUESS WAR WILL DO. (LAUGHTER) ME, I JUST THINK WE'RE ALL JUST PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH TRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER BEFORE OTHER PEOPLE GET A CHANCE TO DO IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHY IT'S IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THERE ARE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS TO THIS. HOW WE DEFINE THE CONFLICT WILL INFORM WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE THREAT FROM ISIS-ISIL.
I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE THREAT FROM ISIL.
I SEE, AND YOU ARE? (LAUGHTER) THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED BETTER WITH GLASSES, PROBABLY. WOULD SOMEONE CARE TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY?
THE PRESIDENT'S RELYING ON THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE PRESIDENT BUSH HAD SIGNED IN 2001 AND 2002, TO DO THIS.
Jon: OH [BLEEP], 13 YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW WHAT, AIN'T NO WAR LIKE A MIDEAST WAR BECAUSE A MIDEAST WAR DON'T STOP. THE ROOF, THE ROOF! THE ROOF HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR CONFLAGRATION BY UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOWS WHAT'S SAD AT A BAR MITZVAH I'M CONSIDERED A GOOD DANCER. (LAUGHTER) ISN'T THAT SAD? ALL RIGHT. SO YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GO AFTER ISIS BASED ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S 2001 AUTHORIZATION OR AUMF FOR GOING AFTER AL QAEDA. BUT THERE ISN'T AL QAEDA, THIS IS ISIS-ISIL.
NOT EVERY COLLECTION OF THUGS THAT LABELS THEMSELVES AL QAEDA WILL POSE A CREDIBLE THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN EFFORTS TO REFINE AND ULTIMATELY REPEAL THE AUMF'S MANDATE.
Jon: WELL, THEN YOU ARE LUCKY THAT CONGRESS NEVER DOES ANYTHING YOU ASK. BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD BE SCREWED RIGHT NOW! (APPLAUSE) SCREWED! BUT THIS REALLY DOES POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BUSH AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS. THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS INCREDIBLY DISCIPLINED AND FOCUSED WHEN THE TIME CAME TO PERSUADE THIS COUNTRY TO DO THE WRONG THING. WHEREAS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE US TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN AS CHAOTIC AND CONFUSED A WAY AS POSSIBLE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
