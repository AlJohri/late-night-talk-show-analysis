Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT PLAYED FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES FOR 19 SEASONS. HE IS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL'S ALL-TIME SAVES AND E.R.A. LEADER. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE CLOSER." LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S GO TO THE PEN, LET'S BRING HIM OUT. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, MARIANO RIVERA, COME HERE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] â™ª  SANDMAN. THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME, YOU ARE THE MICHAEL JORDAN, THE BABE RUTH OF RELIEF PITCHING. NO ONE COMES CLOSE TO YOU. AND I'M SO MAD ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
JON, I KNOW YOU ARE MAD BUT --
Jon: IS THAT A YANKEE JERSEY?
YES, YEAH. YEAH, DEFINITELY. I MEAN, UH --
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO CLEAN MY CAR.
YOU CAN PUT IT ON TOP OF YOUR BED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THIS IS LOVELY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS IS WONDERFUL.
JON, I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jon: I KNOW.
YOU HAVE BEEN SUFFERING ALL THESE YEARS. >>Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE. TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.
Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE. DO YOU KNOW METS FANS? DO YOU EVER MEET THEM ON STREET? DO THEY  --
I HAVE A FRIEND.
Jon: I'M SO SORRY.
I FEEL SORRY, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] I MEAN, I HAVE A FRIEND THAT COMES TO MY HOUSE DRESSED --
Jon: -- METS GEAR.
METS EVERYTHING. I SAID HOW COME YOU COME TO MY HOUSE LIKE THAT? BUT, I LOVE HIM SO. LIKE I LOVE YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT'S VERY KIND. WHEN YOU GO TO THE HALL OF FAME. AND YOU ARE GOING TO GO INTO THE HALL OF FAME. AND YOU MAY BE EVEN UNANIMOUS SELECTION INTO THE HALL OF FAME. DO YOU THINK YOU'LL WEAR A METS CAP OR A YANKEES CAP? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL WEAR? IT'S A BIG DECISION FOR PLAYERS?
YEAH, I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION FOR THAT.
Jon: DO YOU THINK YOU'LL --
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
Jon: OK, OK. I CAN TAKE THAT. TELL ME, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU RARELY SEE STUFF LIKE THIS -- CAN YOU GET IN ON THIS, CHUCK? LOOK AT THIS GUY. LOOK AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THIS KID, THIS YOUNG SKINNY KID. THIS IS ON YOUR WEDDING. THIS IS 1991. YOU WERE SINGLE A BALL, I THINK AT THE TIME.
YES, SINGLE A BALL. YES. WHAT IS THAT KID THINKING? DOES THAT KID HAVE ANY IDEA THE JOURNEY IN FRONT OF HIM?
NO IDEA, JON. I MEAN, I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO JUST MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, MY FATHER SAID WELL, SO YOU GOING THERE. DO YOUR BEST. THAT'S WHAT I DID. I WASN'T EXPECTING ANYTHING. I WAS JUST TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME THAT I LOVE. AND I ENDED UP HERE.
Jon: THIS IS -- I THINK THIS IS WHY EVERYONE WHETHER THEY ARE A FAN OF THE YANKEES OR NOT LOVES MARIANO RIVERA, YOUR HUMILITY IN THE FACE OF THIS IS REMARKABLE. IF I HAD ONE SAVE IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES, I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D EVER WEAR A SHIRT AGAIN. I THINK --
REALLY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I DON'T THINK I WOULD. YOU EVEN SAID, YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD PLAY PRO BASEBALL FOR A LITTLE BIT AND THEN BECOME A MECHANIC.
YES, YES.
IF I DIDN'T WORK, I SAY, WELL, I SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY AND THEN OPEN A SHOP. I WANT TO BE AUTO MECHANIC. BUT THE LORD HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS FOR ME.
Jon: WELL, YOU HAVE TIME NOW TO DO THE AUTO MECHANIC THING.
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT, THOUGH. I'M THINKING ABOUT IT. SO, MAY BE A GOOD SHOW.
Jon: DO YOU STILL -- THE YANKEES DID HAVE A REMARKABLE RUN. AND THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE CORE FOUR, YOU KNOW-- POSADA, JETER, RIVERA AND SOME OTHER GUY.
ANDY.
Jon: OH, YEAH, PETTITTE. SO, YOU HAD THOSE FOUR GUYS. BUT, DURING THAT TIME THE METS WERE ALSO PLAYING. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS: WHAT IS THE BOND LIKE BETWEEN THE FOUR OF YOU? AND IS IT SOMETHING YOU CAN SPEAK OF? IS IT A BROTHERLY RELATIONSHIP? WHAT IS IT LIKE?
IT'S A BROTHERLY RELATIONSHIP. YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN -- CAN'T DESCRIBE. YOU GROW UP THESE THREE GUYS AND COME UP TO THE BIG LEAGUES FOR SO MANY YEARS AND SHARING GOOD TIMES AND TOUGH TIMES. YOU KNOW, BUT -- THE BEAUTY ABOUT IT WAS THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME KIND OF MENTALITY. WE KNOW WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. WE HAD TO GO AND BEAT THE METS. [LAUGHTER] WE ALL HAD THAT IN MIND.
Jon: YOU DID HAVE TO GO BEAT THE METS. AND WHAT DID YOU DO THE NEXT DAY? BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG MARIANO. IS IT STILL FUN TO WATCH YOUR PAL DEREK PLAY? YOU KNOW, IT'S HIS LAST SEASON. YOU WENT THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU BLEW OUT YOUR KNEE AND THEN YOU REHABBED IT TO COME BACK FOR THAT FINAL YEAR. YOU WON COMEBACK PLAYER YEAR. ANY ADVICE FOR DEREK AS HE GOES THROUGH SORT OF THIS TOUR OF MEMORIES?
NO ADVICE, JON. MY WISH FOR DEREK IS THAT -- AND I PRAY EVERY NIGHT FOR HIM TO STAY HEALTHY SO HE CAN ENJOY HIS WHOLE YEAR.
Jon: NICE HEALTHY YEAR, RUN THE WHOLE GAMUT.
THE WHOLE THING. AND ENJOYING AND MAKE SURE THAT HE BE THERE FOR HIS TIME. BECAUSE HE DESERVES IT.
Jon: YOU PRAY FOR THAT EVERY NIGHT?
OH, YES.
Jon: YOU NEVER THROW IN ANYTHING FOR THE METS LIKE A NICE CORNER OUTFIELDER? YOU HAVE A DIRECT LINE CLEARLY UP TO GOD, YOU'RE PRAYING TO HIM EVERY NIGHT.
WE'LL TRY, JON.
Jon: LET'S JUST LET DEREK JETER HAVE ANOTHER NICE YEAR, WHY NOT? THE BEST THERE EVER WAS. THE CLOSER IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. NEVER BE ANOTHER ONE LIKE HIM. MARIANO RIVERA.
