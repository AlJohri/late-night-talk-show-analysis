FRM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,  WREL COME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  -- WELCOME "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED OUR  BRAND NEW SHOW OPEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK -- MY GUEST TONIGHT  IS ASTRO PHYSICIST NEIL. DEGRASSE TYSON. A LEARNED MAN, A MAN OF THE  UNIVERSE. THE LAST TIME HE WAS ON THE  PROGRAM, PERHAPS THE TIME  BEFORE THAT, HE SAID DURING THE NORMAL OPEN TO THE SHOW  THAT THE GRAPHICS GLOBE WAS  SPINNING THE WRONG WAY. [LAUGHTER] WELL, IT TOOK TIME AND A  GREAT DEAL OF INGENUITY BUT  WE'VE FIXED OUR PROBLEM. WE HAVE A BRAND NEW OPEN AND  IT ONLY COST US $1 MILLION. [ LAUGHTER ] I HOPE HE PRESHZ HOW HARD. IF HE THINKS WE'RE GOING TO  GO BACK TO THE OTHER OPEN  TOMORROW, YES! [LAUGHTER] REAL QUICK OFF THE TOP,  TODAY JOHN BRENNAN WAS  SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIS  NOMINATION TO RUN THE C.I.A. ON FIRMED IN THE SENATE. SORT OF A NONEVENT AFTER THE  RECENT CONFIRP --  CONFIRMATION DRAMA -- WHAT  THE WHO? IT WAS A NONEVENT UNTIL  THE --
I RISE TODAY TO  FILIBUSTER THE NOMINATION TO  THE C.I.A.
Jon: LOOKS LIKE WE GOT  US A GOOD OLD FASHION TALKIE  FILIBUSTER, THE KIND OUR GRANDPARENTS TRIED TO TELL  US ABOUT BUT NEVER GOT TO  BECAUSE WE WERE TOO BUSY  PLAYING JACKS AND TIDDLY WINKS WITH OUR FRIENDS  WAITING FOR OUR CHANCE TO  FREEBASE IN THE SHED. AH, THE 70s OR 50s OR  WHATEVER TIME FRAME I APOO  PEER TO BE. RAND PAUL HAS SENT A LETTER  TO ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC  HOLDER ASKING JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION:  CAN THE PRESIDENT  USE A DRONE TO TAKE OUT AN  AMERICAN CITIZEN ON U.S. SOIL? YOU WOULD THINK HE WOULD GET  A LETTER BACK LIKE, NO, WAY! HOLDER WRITES HIM BACK A  LETTER THAT NEVER  DIRECTINGLY ADDRESSING THE  QUESTION KIND OF, SORT OF IMPLIED HYPOTHETICALLY IN  THE RIGHT -- YES, WE CAN DO  THAT PROBABLY WON'T BUT YES. SENATOR RAND PAUL TO DRAW  ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF  THE EXECUTION OF EXECUTIVE  EXECUTIONS EXECUTED THE CLASSICAL FILIBUSTER. I MEAN HE'S OUT THERE  TALKING. THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE -- I  MEAN HE'S USING THE  FILIBUSTER THE WAY IT'S  MEANT TO BE USED.
I WILL SPEAK UNTIL I CAN  NO LONGER SPEAK. I CAN -- IS THES BUT OF THE  PROPELLERS OF DRONES. IN GENERAL HAS ALLOWED  PRESIDENT TO USURP THIS  POWER. FLASHCARDS, ALARM BELLS  SHOULD GO OFF. JUDGES AND JURIES MAKE  MISTAKES. WHO COULD FORGET JANE FONDA  AROUND IN NORTH VIETNAMESE. YOU ARE GOING TO DROP A  DRONE HELLFIRE MISSILE ON  JANE FONDA.
Jon: NO. OF COURSE NOT. HOWEVER MUCH YOU WOULD HAVE  DISAGREED WITH HER POSITION  I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE SHE'S ALREADY PAID A HELLISH  PRICE. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T SAY I AGREE WITH  RAND PAUL ABOUT EVERYTHING  BUT AS ISSUES GO DRONE  OVERSIGHT IS ONE WORTH KICKING UP DUST FOR. THEY ARE PREVENGT THE SENATE  ON GETTING ANYTHING DONE ON  JOHN BRENNAN'S CONFIRMATION IT'S REALLY JUST A REASON TO  NOT GET ANYTHING DONE ON THE  SEQUESTER WHERE YOU RARELY SEE THINGS GOING ON SO  RARELY OUTSIDE OF A NASCAR  RACE. LAUGH LAT THE SEQUESTER SAY  BATTLE OVER GOVERNMENT  FUNDING PRIORITIES TO. GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW  FAR APART THE TWO PARTIES  ARE WE NEED ONLY LOOK TO THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
I PROPOSE WORKING WITH  STATES TO MAKE HIGH QUALITY  PRESCHOOL AVAILABLE TO EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HA-ZAAA! HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL FOR  EVERY SINGLE CHILD. MARRIED CHILDREN, OF COURSE,  TOO BUSY RAISING THEIR OWN  FAMILIES. [ LAUGHTER ] UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. SEEMS LIKE THE SORT OF THING  THAT IS GOING TO GO OVER  PRETTY GOOD.
I HAD AN E-MAIL FROM A  TEACHER AS THEY WERE GIVING  THE SPEECH, SOMEONE I'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME. IT WAS ARE YOU KIDDING ME? MORE PAPERWORK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AND WHAT DO THE  TEACHERS GET FOR THE  PAPERWORK? JUST A BUNCH OF MONEY AND  RESOURCES TO TEACH CHILDREN. I MEAN, I HARDLY THINK  THAT'S WHY MY FRIEND GOT  INTO EDUCATION. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT BESIDES REPRESENTATIVE  BLACK BURN TOTALLY NOT MADE  UP INTERNET TEACHER FRIEND TEUP THERE MUST BE OTHER  REASONS NOT TO FUND THIS  PLAN.
THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN  STUDY SHOWS.
NO RESULTS.
YOU SEE A FEW GAINS IN  THE PRESCHOOL YEARS, GONE BY  FIRST GRADE.
I HAVE READ THAT  PRESCHOOL IS NOT EFFECTIVE  AFTER THE THIRD GRADE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: RIGHT. BECAUSE AT THAT POINT YOU  ARE SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE  FOURTH GRADE. NOT BACK TO PRESCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] THOSE HEAD START SKEPTICS  REFERRING TO A PIECE OF 2012  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT STUDY THAT SHOWED  KIDS WHO WENT TO HEAD START  DID BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE PROGRAM BY  THIRD GRADE RESULTS EVENED  OUT. WHICH MIGHT LEAVE A NORMAL  PERSON TO SAY WHY NOT TAKE  THE BENEFICIAL HEAD START TECHNIQUES AND APPLY THEM TO  THE THIRD GRADE AS OPPOSED  TO THE ARGUMENT THAT THE BENEFITS ONLY LAST A FEW  YEARS SO -- IF WE'RE GOING  WITH STUDIES YOU COULD KEEP READING THE SAME REPORT YOU  ARE QUOTING FROM AND SHOW  THAT OTHER STUDIES HAVE  SHOWN IN GENERAL HEAD START PROGRAMS INCREASE GRADUATION  RATES, LOWER CRIME RATES,  INCREASED ATTENDANCE IN  COLLEGE AND INCREASED -- DECREASED MORTALITY RATES. WHAT WANTS TO GO TO 29  ANYWAY. AM I RIGHT TWEENS? MAYBE IT'S NOT EFFECTIVENESS  CONCERNING THEM.
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY  FOR THAT.
HOW MUCH OF HANDOUT IS  GOING TO COST YOU MONEY?
IT WOULD COST $10,000 PER  KID PER YEAR THANK $300,000  PER CLASSROOM. THIS JUST CRAZY TALK.
Jon: MONEY ON  CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, ARE  YOU MENTAL? [LAUGHTER] IF THESE CHILDREN WANT AN  EDUCATION THEY SHOULD GET  JOBS AND PAY FOR IT  THEMSELVES. THAT'S ILLEGAL, THANKS NANNY  STATE. THE CATEGORY IS THINGS WORTH  INVESTING IN AMERICA'S  FUTURE FOR. PRESCHOOL, NO. ANY OTHER IDEAS?
WE KNOW CHINA IS LOOKING  INTO INVEST IN THE MILITARY. CERTAINLY OUR RELATIONSHIP  WITH RUSSIA HAS CHANGED BUT  THEY ARE -- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A STRONG  MILITARY.
Jon: WE HAVE A STRONG  MILITARY. WE'RE NUMBER ONE BY A MILE. WE SPEND MORE ON DEFENSE  THAN THE NEXT 12 COUNTRIES  COMBINED INCLUDING CHINA  INCLUDING RUSSIA. WE'RE LIKE THE LADY ON JERRY  SPRINGER WHO CAN'T STOP  GETTING BREAST IMPLANTS. THE TRUTH IS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THE TRUTH IS CHINA'S  BUDGET -- CHINA'S MILITARY  BUDGET WOULD BE A FINE SIZE  FOR OUR FIGURE BUT WE'RE NOT SATISFIED UNTIL IT LOOKS  LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO  SHOPLIFT SOCCER BALLS.
Jon: YOU MIGHT WANT TO  LOOK AT LITERACY MATH AND  GRADUATION RATES. DON'T CARE? YOU SHOULD. BECAUSE THOSE NEW EXPENSIVE  WEAPONS SYSTEMS ARE PRETTY  COMPLICATED.
A GROUP OF RETIRED  GENERALS AND ADMIRALS SAY  THAT THE STATE OF AMERICA'S YOUTH IS A THREAT TO  NATIONAL SECURITY. IT CLAIMS THAT THREE OUT OF  OUR AMERICANS BETWEEN THE  AGES OF 17 AND 24 COULDN'T JOIN THE MILITARY IF THEY  WANTED TO BECAUSE THEY  HAVEN'T GRADUATED HIGH  SCHOOL, HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS OR ARE PHYSICALLY  UNFIT. THEY ARE PUSHING FOR EARLY  CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE LAST  ONE? EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT? AH-HA. I GOT IT. PERHAPS COMBINING THE TWO IS  THE ONLY WAY TO GET MORE  MONEY FOR EDUCATION. I GIVE YOU SEAL TEAM  ACTUALLY 6. I WANT TO GET BIN WADIN BUT  I'M NOT ALLOWED TO STAY UP  PAST
