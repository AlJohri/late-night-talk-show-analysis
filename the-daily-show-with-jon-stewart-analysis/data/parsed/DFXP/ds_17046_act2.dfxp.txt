WE KNOW, MITT ROMNEY'S STRENGTH IS HIS BRILLIANT, DETAIL-ORIENTED BUSINESS MIND
ANYONE MAKING UNDER $200,000 A YEAR, WE'LL ELIMINATE ALL  TAXATION ON INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND TAKE THE CORPORATE RATE FROM 35 TO 29. THE PLAN I PUT TOGETHER IS 59 DIFFERENT ACTION STEPS.
Jon: 59 ACTION STEPS! BECAUSE 60 WOULD BE LIKE HOW MANY [BLEEPED] STEPS DO YOU NEED? AND 58 WOULD BE, WHERE'S YOUR PLAN, MAN? ALL THESE NUMBERS RIGHT AT THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. IT'S LIKE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT MONEY THAT CAN STUMP MITT ROMNEY.
GOVERNOR, WILL YOU RELEASE YOUR INCOME PLAN RECORD.
I HADN'T PLANNED ON RELEASING TAX RECORDS. THE LAW REQUIRES US TO RELEASE ALL OF OUR ASSETS, IF THAT'S BEEN THE TRADITION, I'M NOT  OPPOSED TO DOING THAT. TIME WILL TELL. BUT I ANTICIPATE THAT MOST LIKELY I'M GOING TO GET ASKED TO DO THAT AROUND THE APRIL TIME  PERIOD AND I'LL KEEP THAT OPEN.
Jon:, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY I DON'T INTEND IN ANY WAY TO BE HOLDING UP THE PROCESS. I CERTAINLY WOULD WHEN I'M ASKED AND THE QUESTION -- OH, MY GOD, BATMAN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. SORRY. JUST GIVE US THE BIG PICTURE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME DO YOU PAY IN TAXES. THE TOP RATE IS 39%. MAN OF YOUR MEANS, YOUR ACCOUNTANT IS PROBABLY HIGH 20s AND MAYBE 30%. WHILE YOU'RE TELLING ME, I'LL HAVE A SIP OF THIS HOT CUP OF COINS.
IT'S CLOSER TO THE 15% RATE THAN ANYTHING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK I PULLED A TONGUE MUSCLE. THAT'S NOT AN EASY SPIT TAKE. SO MITT ROMNEY PAYS THE SAME TAX RATE AS THE GUY WHO DRIVES THAT  [BLEEPED] BUS BEHIND HIM. HOW'S ROMNEY PULL THAT OFF.
MY LAST TEN YEARS, I'VE... MY INCOME COMES OVERWHELMINGLY FROM  INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE PAST RATHER THAN ORDINARY INCOME OR RATHER THAN EARNED ANNUAL INCOME. AND THEN I GET SPEAKERS FEES FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT NOT VERY MUCH.
Jon: [LAUGHING] OF COURSE NOT, WHO WOULD PAY MITT ROMNEY TO SPEAK. EVEN WHEN HE PRACTICES SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, HIS REFLECTION FALLS ASLEEP. IT'S PROBABLY NOT VERY MUCH MONEY.
ROMNEY EARNED NEARLY $275,000 IN SPEAKING FEES IN 2010. [AUDIENCE REACTS] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: DON'T WORRY, THESE WERE LICKED BY MARIO BATALI BEFORE I PUT THEM IN MY MOUTH. $375,000, THOUSAND, IN SPEAKING FEES IN ONE 12-MONTH PERIOD. MOST AMERICANS WOULD THINK THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. I BET. I WONDER HOW MUCH MONEY I'D BET.
10,000 BUCKS. A 10,000 DOLLAR BET.
Jon: WHO ARE YOU? I WAS THINKING LIKE $20. A HYUNDAI AT BEST. YOU KNOW WHAT, MITT, YOU'RE A RICH MAN. WE ALL KNOW IT. CUT THE CRAP.
THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS, THE 80% TO 90% OF US.
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORRY WHETHER OR NOT YOU'LL GET FIRED. THERE WERE A COUPLE TIMES WHETHER I WONDERED WHETHER I WOULD GET A PINK SLIP. I'M ALSO UNEMPLOYED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S NOT YOU. THIS IS YOU, FRONT AND CENTER IN THE YEARBOOK PHOTO OF THAI BETA JACKOFF AT DOUCHE UNIVERSITY. YOU'RE VERY, VERY RICH. STOP PRETENDING, STOP RUNNING FROM IT. AND JUST OWN IT. JUST COME OUT OF YOUR OBSCENELY LARGE MAHOGANY PANELED CLOSET. AMERICA, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. I AM FLAMINGLY WEALTHY. LETTING US SEE WHO YOU TRULY ARE CAN BE SCARY. BUT IT GETS BETTER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
