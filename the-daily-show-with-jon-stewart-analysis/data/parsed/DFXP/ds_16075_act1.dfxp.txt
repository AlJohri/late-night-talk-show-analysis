JUNE 9th, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE HAVE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, HOWARD WASDIN, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ABOUT SEAL TEAM 6 AND WINNER  OF THIS YEAR'S INCREDIBLY WELL TIMED BOOK RELEASE PRIZE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TO TURN TO A MORE SERIOUS TOPIC, FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS THE NEWS HAS BEEN  DOMINATED BY SCANDAL OF A PARTICULARLY PUR YENT NATURE. -- PURE YENT NATURE. I FOR ONE BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME THAT WE LIFT OUR GAZE FROM THE GOSSIP FILLED GUTTER. THE REAL CHALLENGE FOR NEWT--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE REAL CHALLENGE FOR A NEWS PROGRAM SUCH AS OURS IS NOT HOW BEST TO  INDULGE OUR MOST BASE AND CALLOW INSTINCTS BUT HOW BEST TO CHOOSE WHICH  IMPORTANT BUT NOW OVERLOOKED STORY OF IMPORTANCE TO DO FIRST. SIMPLE. A LITTLE EDITORIAL AUTHORITY, WITH THE HELP OF OUR FRIEND, A GIANT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GIANT-- OUGHT TO DO IT. NOW I GIVE YOU NOW THE DAILY SHOW [BLEEP] BLOCKED STORIES ROUNDUP. THESE ARE OUR STORIES. NOW THESE ARE ALL STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN [BLEEP] BLOCKED BY THIS RECENT SCANDAL. BY THE WAY, LES YOU THINK ME CRASS, THIS IS THE EXACT RUBBER PENIS WHEEL EDWARD R. MURROW USED. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNEW THIS. MURROW'S ORIGINAL SIGNOFF PHRASE WAS GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LICK-- LUCK [BLEEP] WHAT? WE ACTUALLY GOT THIS FROM THE RADIO OF MUSEUM, AND TELEVISION AND DILDO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHILE THIS IS ON LOAN THE MUSEUM IS CLOSED. IT WAS REALLY THEIR ONLY EXHIBIT. SO ANY WAY--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET'S GIVE HIM A SPIN. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, OH, OH, NO JRZ IT'S GOING TO BE-- OH, OUR THREE WARS, WELL, A WORTHY START  SO I'M SORRY, A WORTHY START SO WHERE ARE WE GOING. IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, LIBYA.
THE UNITED STATES REPORTEDLY RAMPING UP AIR STRIKES AGAINST AL QAEDA IN YEMEN.
WAIT, WE'RE BOMBING YEMEN NOW TOO? I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS THE PRESIDENT'S NEW BANNER.
OH. YEAH, WE'VE BEEN SECRETLY HITTING TERROR COMPOUNDS IN YEMEN WITH THE COOPERATION  OF THEIR PRESIDENT SALEH. HOW'S HE DOING?
A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS THE PRESIDENT HAD SHRAPNEL WOUNDS AND SEVERE  BURNS TO HIS FACE AND CHEST FROM AN ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE FRIDAY. THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS HE'LL RETURN AFTER UNDERGOING TREATMENT IN SAUDI ARABIA.
Jon: REALLY? HE'S COMING BACK. I SEE YEMEN'S PRESIDENT SALEH FEELS THE YEMENI INSURGENTS WHO LAUNCHED A  MORTAR ATTACK ON HIM WHILE HE WAS PRAYING WAS A TEMPORARY SETBACK. BUT HE STILLS HAS THE PEOPLE'S SUPPORT ALTHOUGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF  THE LATEST PRESIDENTIAL POPULARITY POLL IN YEMEN, I BELIEVE THAT'S YEMEN FOR  STRONGLY DISAPPROVE. BUT IT'S INTERESTING SALEH STILL WINS IN A HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH ROMNEY. ALL RIGHT, NOW-- YEMEN'S A BIT OF A DOWNER. LET'S TRY AGAIN. STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, OW, OW, OW, STOP, STOP OH.
Jon: OH, SYRIA. DAMMIT.
NOW THE UPRISING OF SYRIA DRAMATIC NEW DEECHLTS DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING A  REVERSAL OF THE GOVERNMENT PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD, THE SYRIAN LEADER SAYING WILL GRANT AMNESTY TO PROTESTORS ARRESTED FOR VARIOUS ALLEGED CRIMES.
Jon: WOW. THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF GOOD NEWS. ASSAD IS A BRUTAL DICTATOR AND I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO OFFER UP AMNESTY.
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY AN AMNESTY AS ONE WOULD UNDERSTAND THE WORLD IN THE  SENSE THAT IT IS NOT A BLANKET PARDON. THOSE WHO HAD RECEIVED A LIFE SENTENCE, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD BE IMPRISONED FOR 20 YEARS. HE WOULD SEE THAT REDUCED TO SERVING OUT A LIFE SENTENCE.
I SEE. SO I THINK SOMEONE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE WORD AMNESTY MEANS. SLOW DOWN THERE, RAINBOW BRIGHT, THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE YOUR RE-ELECTION  CHANCES VULNERABLE TO BEING SOFT ON CRIME. I GUESS TO ASSAD SAM NEST ASH-- ADD NESTY IS JUST THE RETURN ADDRESS ON ALL THE  JUNK MAIL HE THROWS OUT. I THINK I HEAR FROM THE AUDIENCE WE GOT TIME FOR ONE MORE SPIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HELP, HELP, HELP, OH, WHY, STOP, I'M STARTING TO FEEL GOOD, OH, NEVER MIND,OUT,OUT,OUT WHY, WHY, HELP, HELP, HELP, OH, GOD,OUT,OUT OH!, OH!
INDECISION. GAMES OF CHANCE, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? REP CANS RUNNING FOR THAT PARTY'S CONTINUE TO TRY TOS WE ARE WELL ANTHONY WHEEP  ENARY CONTROL OF THE NEWS CYCLE. SOME CANDIDATES ARE MAKING THE CASE FOR STRAIGHT TALK.
I'M WILLING TO TELL AMERICANS THE HARD TRUTH. I WENT TO IOWA AND SAID WE NEED TO FACE OUT FEDERAL ETHANOL SUBSIDIES. I WENT TO FLORIDA AND SAID WE NEED TO RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. I WENT TO NEW YORK CITY AND TOLD WALL STREET THAT THE ERA OF BAILOUTS, CARVEOUTS  AND HANDOUTS HAD TO END.
Jon: I WENT TO WISCONSIN AND I SAID EVERYONE HERE NEEDS TO LOSE LIKE 20 TO 25 POUNDS. I WENT TO IDAHO AND I TOLD THEM, POTATOES ARE NOTHING BUT WHITE TRASH YAMS. (LAUGHTER)
TO SAVE TIME, INSTEAD OF GOING TO MASSACHUSETTS I JUST STEPPED IN DOG [BLEEP]. BOOM! WHO'S UP NEXT. BOOM! OH MY GOD, I ALMOST CUT MY HAND ON THE [BLEEP] WHEEL. (APPLAUSE)
THAT IS WHEN YOU KNOW YOU GOT ISSUES, BABY. CAN'T EVEN SEE IT ANY MORE. WHILE PAWLENTY GETS US TO FACE THE PROBLEM INSIDE US CANDIDATE KANE OFFERS REAL  SOLUTIONS TO FIXAL ISSUES.
DON'T TRY ASK WHAT IT DOESN'T HURT-- YOU DIDN'T --  WE WAS TOO BUSY TRYING TO LIVE. SEND OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL. THAT'S WHY I ONLY ALLOW-- YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THAT ONE.
WILL BE THREE PAGES. IF I AM PRESIDENT, TREATIES WILL HAVE TO FIT ON THE BACK OF A SERIAL BOX. FROM NOW ON THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WILL BE DELIVERED IN THE FORM OF A FORTUNE COOKIE. I AM HER MAN KANE AND I DO NOT LIKE TO READ. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE)
