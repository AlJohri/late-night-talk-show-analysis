NOW, WHILE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SPENT YESTERDAY TRYING TO BECOME PRESIDENT, THERE WAS A FELLA WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT. PRESS CONFERENCE.
NOW, I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME POLITICAL CONTESTS GOING ON TONIGHT. BUT I THOUGHT I'D START THE DAY OFF BY TAKING A FEW QUESTIONS, WHICH I'M SURE WILL NOT BE POLITICAL IN NATURE.
Jon: OH, IT APPEARS SUPER TUESDAY JUST BECAME SARCASTIC TUESDAY. [LAUGHTER] A LITTLE CYNICAL THERE, MY FRIEND. GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO ASK WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO ASK.
YOUR CRITICS WILL SAY ON CAPITOL HILL THAT YOU WANT GAS PRICES TO GO HIGHER BECAUSE YOU  HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT WILL WEAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OFF FOSSIL FUELS ON TO RENEWBLE FUELS. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU HOW HE'S GOING TO RESPOND. I THINK HE'S GOING TO TAP HIS STRATEGIC DERISION RETURNS.
ED, FROM A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  GOING INTO AN ELECTION WANTS GAS PRICES TO GO HIGHER IS. THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO THINKS THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL TELL YOU, WHAT ED, I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION JUST AS SOON AS I INFLATE THIS. [LAUGHTER] THAT MAY NOT HAVE SEEMED THE MOST PRESIDENTIAL TONE, BUT UNDERSTAND THE DERISION IS BASED  ON THE TYPE OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMING AT HIM.
YOUR CRITICS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING JOHN McCAIN, SAID YOU SHOULD START  AIR STRIKES NOW.
MITT ROMNEY HAS CRITICIZED YOU ON IRAN AND SAID HOPE IS NOT A FOREIGN POLICY.
MITT ROMNEY ON SUNDAY WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE  REELECTED, IRAN WILL GET A BOMB AND THE WORLD WILL CHANGE.
HE ALSO SAID THAT YOU ARE AMERICA'S MOST FECKLESS PRESIDENT SINCE CARTER. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO MR. ROMNEY?
Jon: I'D TELL HIM TO GO FECK HIMSELF. THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY. FECK. FECK HIMSELF. AS USUAL, THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS WAS PRACTICING WHAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED INSTIGATIVE  JOURNALISM, LIKE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM, ONLY INSTEAD OF INVESTIGATING, THEY INSTIGATE. THEY PROD THE PERSON AT THE PODIUM WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S TRASH TALK TO SEE IF THEY CAN GIN UP  THE FIGHT. IT'S LIKE A FORTUNE COOKIE GAME, BUT INSTEAD OF ADDING IN BED TO THE END OF EVERY ONE OF THEIR QUESTIONS, YOU JUST HAVE TO ADD, ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT  [BLEEPED]? LET'S PLAY.
ON IRAN, MITT ROMNEY WENT SO FAR TO SAY IF YOU ARE REELECTED, IRAN WILL GET A BOMB AND THE WORLD WILL CHANGE.
Jon: YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT  [BLEEPED]?
DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID THAT REPUBLICANS ON A SIMILAR ISSUE ARE ENGAGED IN A WAR ON WOMEN. SOME TOP REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S MORE LIKE DEMOCRATS ARE ENGAGED  IN A WAR FOR THE WOMEN'S VOTE.
MR. PRESIDENT, MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT [BLEEPED]?
LATINO VOTERS, SOME ARE STILL DISAPPOINTED, OTHERS UPSET ABOUT A PROMISE YOU MADE ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT HAS YET TO COME TO PASS.
I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU THEN WOULD BE, VASA TOMAS ESA MIERDA?
MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE SWITCH FROM THE G-8 SUMMIT FROM CAMP DAVID TO WASHINGTON. THE REASON IS NOW YOU WANTED A MORE INTIMATE SUMMIT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IN BED. SOME STILL WORK WITH "IN BED." IT'S NOT LIKE THERE WASN'T  PLENTY OF NON-HEARSAY NEWS FOR THE MEDIA TO ASK ABOUT JUST FROM THE PREVIOUS 24 HOURS.
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER SAYS THAT THE U.S. CAN LEGALLY TARGET AND KILL AMERICAN  CITIZENS OVERSEAS IF THEY'RE TIED TO TERRORISM.
HOLDER SAYS DEW POINT DOESN'T MEAN JUDICIAL PROCESS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY.
Jon: WHAT, DID... HUH? RIGHT THERE HE SAID "DEW POINT DOESN'T MEAN JUDICIAL PROCESS." ALL RIGHT. DEW POINT -- DUE PROCESS DOES NOT MEAN WHAT YOU THINK. HOW COME NO ONE AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE BROUGHT THAT UP, DIDN'T EVEN SAY A WORD ABOUT IT. IF THERE WERE ONLY SOME WAY TO GET THE PRESS CORPS INTERESTED IN SOMETHING... HEY, MEDIA YOUR  CRITICS SAY THAT YOUR FIRST PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE IN THREE MONTHS YOU DIDN'T SAY  ANYTHING ABOUT AN HISTORICALLY MASSIVE EXECUTIVE BRANCH POWER GRAB. YOU GOING TO TAKE THAT  [BLEEPED]? [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
