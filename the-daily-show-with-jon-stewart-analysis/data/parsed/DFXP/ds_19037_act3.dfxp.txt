[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S THE FIRST FEMALE FILMMAKER IN SAUDI ARABIA. HER MOVIE WHICH SHE WROTE AND DIRECTED IS CALLED WADJDA. HER MOVIE WHICH SHE WROTE AND DIRECTED IS CALLED WADJDA.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME HAIFAA AL MANSOUR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WOW.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL I SEE YOU ARE WEARING THE TRADITIONAL SAUDI BLACK LEATHER FONZIE JACKET. I BOUGHT IT TO YOU FOR, JON.
Jon: IT'S LOVELY. WHAT A LOVELY WONDERFUL FILM.
AH.
Jon: CAN YOU EXPLAIN JUST BRIEFLY THE PLOT FOR EVERYBODY?
YEAH, IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET IT OFF THE GROUND, FIVE YEARS OF WORK. IT'S A JOURNEY OF A LITTLE GIRL IN SAUDI. SHE'S FEISTY, HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.
Jon: THIS IS THE WOMAN THAT WE SAW?
WADJDA, YEAH. SHE WANTS A BICYCLE. YOU KNOW SAUDI ARABIA ALL CONSERVATIVE AND IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT WOMEN CANNOT DO AND EVERYTHING. BUT SHE MANAGES TO GET IT AND IT'S ABOUT ACHIEVING DREAMS AND WORKING HARD. IT CONCENTRATES MORE ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY AND RESISTANCE AND RESILIANCE.
Jon: BUT THIS IS WHAT I SO APPRECIATE ABOUT IT. THE THEME IS SO UNIVERSAL AND SIMPLE THAT YOU FORGET. AND THEN THE CONTEXT OF WHERE IT IS JUST BECOMES PART OF THE BACKDROP, AND IT REALLY HELPS TO HUMANIZE ALL THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND INFORM IN A WAY THAT I THINK IT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE.
I TRIED NOT TO JUST LIKE COMPLAIN ABOUT REALITY AND MAKE IT INSPIRING. PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA WOMEN IN GENERAL NEED TO HAVE REFERENCE OF PEOPLE WORKING REALLY HARD TO CHANGE THEIR DESTINY. IT'S HARD JUST TO SHOW WOMEN AS VICTIMS. WE NEED TO SHOW THEM AS WOMEN WHO ARE PROACTIVE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR LIFE BETTER. IT'S GOOD FOR ESPECIALLY YOUNGER GENERATIONS TO SEE THAT.
Jon: THIS LITTLE GIRL, WHO BY THE WAY, WHAT A FIRECRACKER, WHERE DID YOU FIND THE YOUNG ACTRESS BECAUSE SHE'S TERRIFIC IN THIS? IT'S HARD TO FIND ACTRESSES IN SAUDI ESPECIALLY YOUNG ONES NOT IN THE BUSINESS. IT WAS THE FIRST FILM EVER FILMED COMPLETELY IN SAUDI.
Jon: THERE'S NO MOVIE STUDIOS NO IMAX NONE OF THAT.
NOTHING.
Jon: SYNAGOGUES, NOTHING.
THAT IS FOR SURE. [LAUGHTER] WE DIDN'T WANT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION. WORK LOW PROFILE. WE CAN'T PUT CASTING CALLS FOR GIRLS. WE HAD TO RELY ON THE WORD OF MOUTH AND SMALL PRODUCTION COMPANIES THAT INCLUDES KIDS FOR HOLIDAYS AND ALL THAT. YEAH, WE MET A LOT OF AMAZING GIRLS, REALLY BEAUTIFUL HAVE CHARISMA BUT THEY GO HOME AND HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. THE HEART IS BREAKING BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF SOCIETY AND WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK OF THEM. THEN I WROTE THE STORY ON MY NIECE. I HAVE A NIECE LIKE THIS ALWAYS SCHEMING TO EARN SOME MONEY. IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF THE SPIRIT OF MY NIECE. SHE DIDN'T CARE SHE DIDN'T DO HER HAIR OR ANYTHING. I LIKED THAT.
Jon: IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. AS I WATCHED IT, I THOUGHT IT'S SO DETAILED IT SMACKED OF PERSONAL -- IT'S THE GREEN BIKE. THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A GREEN BIKE IN YOUR PAST.
OH, YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE IT'S TOO -- THERE WAS SOMETHING SO ORGANIC AND NATURAL.
I HAD A GREEN BICYCLE. I'M FROM A BIG FAMILY, ONE OF 12 KIDS, ONE IN BETWEEN TWO BOYS. MY FATHER TOOK MY BROTHERS TO BUY A BICYCLE. I SAW A GREEN ONE. HE WANTED TO BUY IT FOR ME BUT THE GUY SELLING WASN'T HAPPY WAS THINKING MY FATHER DID THE WRONG DECISION.
Jon: DIDN'T WANT TO SELL TO A GIRL?
YEAH, HE SOLD IT BUT HE MADE HIS OBJECTION CLEAR.
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO WATCH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW THE GIRL AND HER MOTHER INTERACTED IN PUBLIC AND INTERACTED IN PRIVATE. IN PRIVATE IT'S SORT OF THE WHOLE WORLD OPENS UP TO THEM AND THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP BUT IN PUBLIC IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A SENSE OF FEAR OR --
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: OR ANXIETY.
SAUDI IS ALL ABOUT WHAT IS PRIVATE AND WHAT IS PUBLIC. PUBLIC PEOPLE HAVE TO -- EVEN MEN HAVE TO WEAR ALL THE GEAR AND ALL THAT AND KEEP A CERTAIN PERSONA. AT HOME THERE'S FLIRTING, LOVE FOR FOOD, DANCING. THAT'S KIND OF LIKE NORMAL FAMILY LIFE. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SEE THAT ABOUT SAUDI. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT THE SOCIETY. TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THE CULTURE. WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE ECONOMY AND POLITICS BUT IT'S NICE TO KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE.
Jon: HAS THE GOVERNMENT CONTACTED YOU?
OH, YES.
Jon: ARE THEY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS? UPSET ABOUT THIS? YOU FILMED IN SAUDI. WOMEN ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK TO UNRELATED RELATIVES WHO ARE MEN. HOW DID YOU EVEN FILM?
OH, YEAH IN PUBLIC I WAS IN A VAN.
Jon: YOU WERE IN A VAN?
YES AND I HAD A WALKIE TALKIE AND HAD A MONITOR.
Jon: YOU COULDN'T GO ON THE STREET SO YOU WOULD SIT IN THE VAN AND TALK TO THE ACTORS.
IT'S A VERY COMPLIANT PLACE.
Jon: WHAT DO THEY THINK OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE?
THEY NOMINATED THE FILM SAUDI ARABIA TO THE OSCARS.
Jon: THEY LOVE IT. THAT'S VERY NICE. IT'S EXCITING.
IT IS EXCITING. I THINK THAT IT'S OPENING UP TO WOMAN AND ARTS. IT'S VERY CONSERVATIVE AND PEOPLE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT TO SAY OR NOT TO SAY BUT THERE'S A SMALL SPACE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT SPACE. LEARN FROM IRANIAN FILMMAKERS THEY DO FILMS FROM WHERE THEY COME FROM AND ACCEPTED BACK HOME AND I THINK IT'S EFFECTIVE IN CHANGING PEOPLE THERE AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS CHANGE THAT TAKES ROOTS DEEP IN LIKE BELIEF AND TRADITION.
Jon: I THINK WHAT IS SO OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE YOU CAN READ IT TWO WAYS BUT WHAT LEAVES WITH YOU AN OPTIMISTIC FEELING IS THERE'S A CERTAIN AIR OF INEVITABILITY ABOUT THIS CHANGE. THIS IS OUT OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO STOP.
I THINK THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT NOW ALL THE INFORMATION AND SAUDIS ARE RICH. ALL THE KIDS HAVE AN iPAD,  ACCESS TO INTERNET. YOU CANNOT STOP THAT.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS. IT'S A MARVELOUS FILM. WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. GOOD LUCK WITH THE OSCARS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: WADJDA IT'S IN THEATERS NOW. HAIFAA AL MONSOUR.
