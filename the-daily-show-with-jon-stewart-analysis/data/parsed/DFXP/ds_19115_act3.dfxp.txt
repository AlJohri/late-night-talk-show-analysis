[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, BESTSELLING AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE RULE OF NOBODY: SAVING AMERICA FROM DEAD LAWS AND BROKEN GOVERNMENT". PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM PHILIP K. HOWARD. SIR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS. I'M EXCITED WHEN YOU COME BY. ME AND YOU, WE'RE GOING TO FIX THIS DAMN, "THE RULE OF NOBODY: SAVING AMERICA FROM DEAD LAWS AND BROKEN GOVERNMENT." WHENEVER WE TALK, I AM STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT WHEN I READ YOUR BOOKS, WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU SPEAK, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF US AS A NATION OF IDIOTS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE OF GOOD INTENTION? BECAUSE I THINK WE ARE STILL A PEOPLE OF GOOD INTENTION.
WELL, AT SOME LEVEL DEEP IN OUR ID, WE DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO MAKE A DECISION, SO WE TRIED TO CREATE A SYSTEM OF AUTOMATIC GOVERNMENT WHERE CORRECTNESS WOULD BE LAID OUT IN ADVANCE AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE PERFECT AND NO ONE WOULD BE UNHAPPY AT THEIR JOBS. YOU KNOW, AND GOVERNMENT WOULD NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE. OF COURSE, THE PROBLEM IS IN MAKING THAT SYSTEM, GOVERNMENT DOES NOTHING BUT MAKE MISTAKES.
JON: SO WE HAVE, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL FOR EACH OUTCOME, HAVE CREATED AN UNEXPECTED OUTCOME THAT WE DIDN'T INTEND TO CREATE?
RIGHT. PARALYSIS.
Jon: YES. [LAUGHTER] BUT IS THE ANSWER THEN... ARE OUR ONLY TWO CHOICES A PARALYZED, BUREAUCRATIC SATIRE OF A GOVERNMENT OR AN 1890S SIX-YEAR-OLDS? SURE. THEY CAN WORK IN MINES. YOU KNOW, WHAT IS OUR, WHAT IS OUR MIDDLE GROUND? WHERE DO WE GO?
THE MIDDLE GROUND IS... THE CONSTITUTION IS AN OPEN FRAMEWORK OF GOALS AND PRINCIPLES. IT'S TEN PAGES LONG. THE VOLCKER RULE IS 980 PAGES. LAW IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH PEOPLE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AND THEN YOU HOLD IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHETHER THEY SUCCEED IN RUNNING THE AGENCY PROPERLY OR WHATEVER. BUT WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE AUTHORITY THAT GOES WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY WITH LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WORDS OF LAW, SO THAT IT'S BECOME THIS VAST VAT OF LEGAL QUICKSAND. IT GETS THICKER EVERY YEAR. IT'S A PROGRESSIVE DISEASE. IT IS WORSE NOW THAN IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO. IT WILL BE WORSE NEXT YEAR.
Jon: BUT WHY CAN'T WE GO IN, TO USE A GEORGE BUSH PARLANCE, AND CLEAR THE BRUSH? [LAUGHTER] WHY CAN'T WE GO IN THERE AND CLEAR SOME OF THE DEAD WOOD? IS THERE ANYONE WHO CAN EXERCISE ANY SENSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY OR BUREAUCRATIC AUTHORITY?
NOT UNTIL WE HAVE THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO GO CLEAN IT OUT AND RESTORE, ONE, HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY AND RESET OUR PRIORITIES. WHAT WE NOW HAVE IS ALL THESE LAWS PILING ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OF DETAIL, SO THAT DEMOCRACY AT THIS POINT IS BASICALLY RUN BY DEAD PEOPLE. IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE ALL OF THESE LAWS OVER THE LAST 30, 40, 50, 60 YEARS THAT LITERALLY DICTATE HOW YOU RUN THE V.A. OR HOW YOU DO PROCUREMENT OF I.T. SYSTEMS.
Jon: BUT IS THERE NO PROCESS IN PLACE WHERE COMMON SENSE -- THE V.A. IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE. THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG. THEY DECIDE TO INCENTIVIZE QUICKER WAIT TIMES AT THE LOCAL V.A.S WHILE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AND CLEARLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEED TREATMENT THROUGH TWO WARS. DOES ANYONE HAVE A MACRO VIEW OF THAT AND THINK, OH, THOSE ARE ALL AT CROSS-PURPOSES. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT?
APPARENTLY NOT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN THAT. ALL RIGHT. I THOUGHT WE'D GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE NITTY-GRITTY. BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT... THEN WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
THEY'RE SETTING METRICS AND PUTTING IN ALL THESE RULES AND EXPECT THAT PEOPLE CAN COMPLY WITH ALL THE RULES AND GET THE JOB DONE. THAT'S NOT HOW ANYBODY... NOT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE HAS ANYONE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING BY FOLLOWING A RULE. THEY ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES, THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, AND THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE TO TAKE CARE OF THE V.A., AND THEY DO THE BEST JOB AND THAT REPORT AND SAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE WAITING TIMES TO 14 DAYS IF WE HAVE BACKLOG OF 1,000 PEOPLE HERE. AND THEY ACTUALLY REPORT HONESTLY AND THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW WELL THEY DO GIVEN THE RESOURCES, NOT SOME ARBITRARY METRIC, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
Jon: SO ARE STANDARDS ALWAYS ANATHEMA? CAN YOU NEVER RELY ON, LIKE, I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY IN THE CITY, AND THIS MAY BE A POOR ONE, OUR GRADING SYSTEM ON RESTAURANTS -- A, B, C, D. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET THAT GRADE, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS: I STOPPED EATING AT B'S ABOUT A YEAR AGO. [LAUGHTER] IT FEELS LIKE IT'S WORKING. IT FEELS LIKE A BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM THAT HAS SET SOME STANDARDS TO ACHIEVE AND HAS DONE IT, AND IT'S SIMPLE AND IT'S THE ALPHABET. LORD KNOWS I LOVE THE ALPHABET. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH. WELL, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT LAW BE COMPREHENSIBLE, AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE OF LAW, THE BUREAUCRATS, WHOEVER, BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN DETERMINING WHETHER A RESTAURANT MEETS SANITARY CODES AND SUCH, AND THEY GIVE US A LETTER GRADE AND THE PUBLIC CAN SEE THAT IT HAS A LETTER GRADE AND THAT CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT. THAT'S... GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK THAT WAY.
SO FROM WHAT I'M HEARING, THE WAY WE FIX THIS IS EVERYBODY GETS A GRADE, A THROUGH F, AND WE JUST START WEEDING THROUGH THE DAMN THINGS. WE'VE GOT GO TO COMMERCIAL, BUT ON THE WEB YOU'LL EXPLAIN HOW THAT WILL WORK CORRECTLY, YES?
YES.
Jon: GOOD MAN. "THE RULE OF NOBODY," IT'S ON BOOKSHELVES NOW. IT'S GREAT. YOU GOT TO GET IT, AS ALWAYS. PHILIP K. HOWARD. WE'LL BE BACK.
