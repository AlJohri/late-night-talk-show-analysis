[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS. OVER THE WEEKEND. VERY EXCITING DEVELOPMENT IN MY HOME STATE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S OFFICIALLY PASSED MIDNIGHT. MARRIAGE IS EQUAL IN NEW JERSEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: LET'S GET READY TO COUPLE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AT LONG LAST, PEOPLE FROM NEW JERSEY CAN LEGALLY MARRY EACH OTHER. I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. IT'S WEDDING DAY FOR HUNDREDS OF SAME SEX COUPLES IN NEW JERSEY. GAY MARRIAGE NOW LEGAL IN THAT STATE.
Jon: THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THAT PEOPLE FROM NEW JERSEY ARE ALLOWED TO MARRY OTHER PEOPLE FROM NEW JERSEY. YOU KNOW, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU BADA BING AND BADA BOOM. YOU MAY NOW BADA BING THE BADA BOOM. [ LAUGHTER ] APPARENTLY WHAT HAPPENED WAS LAST MONTH A LOWER COURT JUDGE RULED THAT NEW JERSEY HAD TO ALLOW GAY MARRIAGES AND THE STATE SUPREME COURT RULED 7-0 THAT THEY HAD SO START TODAY. WHY TODAY? GREG AND MICHAEL AREN'T GETTING ANY YOUNGER. IT WAS AN EXCITING NIGHT AND FEW MORE EXCITED THAT NEWARK MAYOR AND SENATOR ELECT CORY BOOKER, W.HO OFFICIATED ONE OF THE FIRST WEDDINGS.
I HAVE TO DO THIS BY LAW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IS THIS ONE OF THOSE STOP AND FRISK DEALS? IS THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO BY LAW? WHY IS HE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE LAW? MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LET HIM --
ALL RIGHT. SO I HAVE TO DO THIS BY LAW AND SO BEFORE WE EXCHANGE THE VOWS, I MUST ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE PRESENT HERE TODAY THAT SHOULD KNOW OF ANY REASON WHY JOSEPH AND ORVILLE SHOULD NOT BE MARRIAGED -- MARRIED, SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.
Jon: IN NEW JERSEY THAT IS THE LAW. YOU ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO ASK IF ANYONE OBJECTS TO A WEDDING. NOT JUST WEDDINGS IN NEW JERSEY YOU HAVE TO DO THAT FOR EVERYTHING. IT'S PART OF THE STATE'S YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT ACT 1794. AT ANY BAR IN NEW JERSEY AT SOME POINT DURING THE NIGHT, SOMEBODY LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT? THEY DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THEY ARE OBEYING THE LAW. TIME FOR THE SPECIAL MOMENT THEY'VE BEEN WAITING FOR ALL THEIR LIVES.
DO YOU WISH TO BE JOINED IN MARRIAGE.
YES. YES.
YES.
AND I WISH TO JOIN YOU. NOT IN MARRIAGE BUT JOIN YOU TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: TOO LATE IT ALREADY GOT WEIRD SO.
I DECLARE JOSEPH AND ORVILLE TO BE LAWFUL SPOUSES IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU MAY KISS YOUR SPOUSE! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT!
Jon: GETTING WEIRDER!
ALL RIGHT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU MAY HUG YOUR MAYOR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: LEAVE THEM ALONE. IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU. AND YOU THINK THAT'S BAD YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED DURING THEIR FIRST DANCE. LET THEM GO! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
