[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HEY, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THAT'S OUR SHOW. TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00 I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM, MR. BILL COSBY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S A GENEROUS AUDIENCE RIGHT THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T GET TO SEE HIM. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
IS THIS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS GONE TOO FAR? KEVIN?
IT DOESN'T DESERVE A COMMENT. >>IT'S SO BIZARRE. STUPID.
