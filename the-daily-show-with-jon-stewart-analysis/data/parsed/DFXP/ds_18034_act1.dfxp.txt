FROM COMPANY DEE  CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. GOING TO BREAK THE BANK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, RIGHT HERE  ON THIS STAGE, SHOULD I SAY  A CERTAIN BOSS FROM NEW  JERSEY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOT THAT ONE. GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE. HUH? HE'S THE BOSS. (APPLAUSE)  THE OTHER BOSS. FOLKS, WE'VE BEEN SO WRAPPED  UP HERE IN THIS COUNTRY WITH  OUR ELECTION, OUR FISCAL CLIFF, OUR INATTENTION TO  EVENTS IN EGYPT AND SYRIA  THAT WE FORGET THERE ARE  IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL STORIES THAT DESERVE OUR  FOCUS. AND THEN THERE'S THIS ONE.
YES, EXCITING THE BRITISH  ROYALTY IS EXPANDING AM WILL  AND KATE WITH PREGGERS.
SEE THAT, IT'S A ROYAL  BABY BUMP, WHAT A JOY TO BE  HERE ON THIS DAY OF  CELEBRATION.
THERE'S THE PICTURE ON  THE TIMES, WE'RE EXPECTING. AND THEN I LOVE THIS ONE,  KATE'S EXPECTATIONS. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: NOT BAD. KIND OF OBVIOUS, I MEAN IF  YOU WANT TO GO WITH  PREGNANCY PUNS BASED ON  BRITISH LITERATURE. WHY NOT MacBIRTH OR WHY  LIMIT YOURSELF TO ENGLISH  LITERATURE Y NOT MADAM'S  OVARIS. (LAUGHTER)  THE PRINCE AND THE HOPPER. PORTRAIT OF THE FETUS AS A  YOUNG MAN. WAIT, WAIT! PERHAPS DICKENS WAS BEST, A  TALE OF SORE TITTIES. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
IT WAS THE BEST OF-- THE  BREAST OF TIMES WHAT AN  ERUDITE CROWD. TITTIES.
COME ON, IT'S JUST A  BABBEE. YOU CAN'T TELL ME BRITISH  PEOPLE ACTUALLY GIVE A CRAP  ABOUT THIS STUFF.
I JUST COME AND IT'S  REALLY EXCITING BECAUSE-- SORRY.
OH, YOU'RE HAPPY FOR THEM.
I AM HAPPY.
Jon: DON'T GET TOO  OVERWHELMED. THAT WOMAN IS THE ROYAL WEEPER. FOR RUNS OF YEARS HER FAMILY  HAS SERVED AS THE HOUSE OF  WINDSOR'S OFFICIAL STRONG EMOTION SURROGATE. SO WHAT A COMMONERS THINK.
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER ONE,  ISN'T IT. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT IS NOT THE  ACCENT YOU EXPECT FROM  APOPADOPOLOUS. TO ME THE MOST STRIKING  THING ABOUT KATE'S PREGNANCY  IS HOW MUCH THE MEDIA WANTED TO LET US KNOW THAT THEY  TOTALLY KNEW SHE WAS  PREGNANT.
TABLOID SPECULATION BEGAN  EVEN BEFORE THE WEDDING. FUELED BY EVERY TOUCH OF THE  BELLY, EVERY SIP OF PLAIN  WATER, EVERY DRESS WITH A CHANGING WAISTLINE. THE SIGNS WERE THERE JUST  LAST WEEK DURING A VISIT TO  CAMBRIDGE. KATE WAS SPOTTED TICKLING  THE FEET OF A BABY BOY IN  THE CROWD.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S  PREGNANT. THAT JUST MEANS SHE'S HUMAN. HOW DO YOU NOT TICKLE A  BABY'S FEET. WHAT, BEFORE SHE WAS  PREGNANT SHE WAS JUST GIVING  BABIES THE HEIGHTSMAN, JUST  THAT. GET OUT OF MY FACE, BABY. I'M NOT PREGNANT, I TICKLE  BABY'S FEET. THE DRINKING WATER, TICKLING  BABY'S FEET, ANY OTHER  SUBTLE HINTS.
INTRACTABLE VOMITING OR  THROWING UP THAT GOING ON  SEVERAL TIMEANCE HOUR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: APPARENTLY THE  DUCHESS OF WINDSOR HAS BEEN  FLINGING HER BISCUITS, AS THEY SAY. SO WHILE MORNING SICKNESS  MAY BE ALL RIGHT FOR  COMMONERS, THE ROYALS PUKE  FANCY.
SHE IS IS SUFFERING FROM  WHAT IS CALLED HYPEREMESIS.
HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM.
ISN'T THAT THE SPELL THAT  US ED TO DEFEAT VOLDEMORT.
HYPER, MESIS GRAVIDARUM. BLAH.
HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM.
NOT COOL, HERMIONE.
LUCKILY KATES HAD NOW  RECOVERED FROM THE VOMITING  AND WITH ALL THE SPECULATION ABOUT WHETHER SHE'S PREGNANT  FINALLY BEHIND US, PERHAPS  WE CAN GET DOWN TO MORE SERIOUS SPECULATION.
THE BOOK MAKERS ARE  ALREADY RUNNING BETS ON, YOU  KNOW, IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL.
8 TO 1 THE HAIR COLOR  WILL BE GINGER.
WHAT WILL THE ROYAL BABY  LOOK LIKE.
WHERE WILL IT GO TO SKL.
8 TO 1 IT IS THE BABY IS  BORN A GIRL, ELIZABETH.
BOY MAYBE, MAYBE CHARLES,  MAYBE GEORGE.
THE WAGERING BEGINS.
A CHILD WILL BE BORN UNTO  US. AND HE SHALL CEASE UPON IT  FOR O AMUSEMENT FROM THE  GET-GO. IT DOES RAISE THE  PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION DOES  LOSS OF PRIVACY AGAIN AT  CONCEPTION? LET'S HOPE. FOR OUR-- FOR OUR  ENTERTAINMENT'S SAKE, SHE  HAS A LITTER.
COULD THE MORNING  SICKNESS MEAN TWINS?
HEADLINE THIS MORNING S  IT TWINS.
MAYBE EVEN TWINS.
MAYBE.
SO IF IT'S TWINS TO  CLARIFY THE DOCTOR WILL NEED  TO DECIDE WHICH BABY TO PULL OUT FIRST AND THAT  WILL-- THAT'S THE HEIR. (LAUGHTER)  OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT A DOCTOR  BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S HOW  IT WORKS. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY, SCREW  THE DOCTOR, LET THE  IMPARTIALALITY OF THE CLAW  MACHINE DECIDE. (LAUGHTER)  FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY  SENIOR PRENATAL  CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE. SAMANTHA, THANKS FOR JOINING  US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Jon: SAM, OBVIOUSLY  THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION  ABOUT THIS BABY, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? >>.
JON, I CAN END ALL THE  SPECULATION RIGHT NOW. IT'S A BOY. HIS NAME IS PHILIP, NOT A  GINGER, THANK GOD. LOVES ADELE, HATES RUSSELL  BRAND. BELIEVES THAT ONE DAY HE  WILL GET IN INDIA BACK FOR  ENGLAND.
Jon: WAIT, NOW  THAT-- THAT IS INCREDIBLY  DETAILED FOR THE FIRST  TRIMESTER. DID YOU TALK TO ONE OF  KATE'S MADES IN WAITING, DID  YOU GET AHOLD OF THE MEDICAL  RECORDS.
JON, I JUST MET HIM. I'M IN KATE MIDDLETON'S  UTERUS.
Stephen: .
Jon: WHAT SM.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, IT'S SO  PRETTY.
Jon: REALLY FROM HOW IS  THAT POSSIBLE? (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW IS THAT  POSSIBLE?
JON, IT'S CALLED  JOURNALISM. LISTEN, I DIDN'T SPEND THREE  YEARS WORKING FOR MURDOCH  AND HACKING THE PHONES OF DEAD SOLLIER'S FAMILIES TO  NOT KNOW HOW TO SNEAK UP A  ROYAL VAGINA. WHOOO!
Jon: PRETTY ORNATE.
YEAH, WOW. THIS THING IS A CRAZY  UPGRADE FROM YOUR STANDARD  BABY BAKER.
Jon: YEAH.
THE EMBRYONIC FLUID IS A  1911 CHATEAU LAFITE THAT WAS  RECOVERED FROM THE TITANIC. THE UMBILICAL CORD, HAND  SEWN CUSTOM HERMES ZUBLING  AND ARCHIVAL PRINT THEY  BROUGHT BACK JUST FOR THIS LITTLE GUY. AND OH MY GOD, THE UPSTAIRS  MILK BAR THEY'RE PUTTING  TOGETHER? WHOA, THE SELECTION, WHOLE  MILK, 1%, SOY, GOAT, MILLING  FROM A JAMAICAN WET NURSE. IT'S AMAZING.
Jon: REALLY?
YEAH, IT IS A SUCKLER  PARADISE.
Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE YOU  HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR  YOU I SURE DO. BUT NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE  THE NEXT NUMBER 2 TRAIN OUT  OF HERE F YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, YEAH.
Jon: YEAH, NO, I-- WE GET  IT.
I WILL RIDE ONE OF KATE'S  ROYAL POOPS INTO THE TOILET.
Jon: EXPLANATION WAS  COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.
OKAY.
