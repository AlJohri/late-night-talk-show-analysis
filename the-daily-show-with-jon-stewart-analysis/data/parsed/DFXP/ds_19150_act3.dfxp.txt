Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO.
IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE FOR ME TO BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS SHOW.
Jon: WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE. IN YOUR CAREER, IN YOUR LIFE, CAN YOU RECALL A MORE DIRE TIME FOR THE HUMAN CONDITION? IS THAT HOW IT STRIKES YOU NOW? ARE YOU AN OPTIMIST?
FOR MANY YEARS TRAGIC SITUATIONS WHERE I FEEL VERY SAD, PARTICULARLY WHEN U.N. PEACEKEEPERS ARE KILLED, WHEN THERE'S A HUGE, SERIOUS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. MANY WOMEN AND GIRLS BEING KILLED ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT-- OF THE UNITED NATIONS. THAT IS ONE OF MY STRONGEST MANDATES BY THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS. OF COURSE WE HAVE TO KEEP PEACE AND SECURITY, ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
Jon: IS THERE -- HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO RALLY THE WORLD TO THESE CAUSES? BECAUSE WE SEE THIS SITUATION BOKO HARAM IN NIGERIA, ISIS, SYRIA, UKRAINE, GAZA, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK THE U.N. TO-- TO-- OR IS IT BETTER FOR THE U.N. TO KEEP FOCUSED ON HUMANITARIAN ISSUES AND TRY AND SORT OUT THE MORE POLITICAL ISSUES LATER. OR CAN YOU ACCOMPLISH BOTH?
I THINK WE ARE LIVING IN AN ERA OF MULTIPLE CRISES. A LOT OF CRISES ARE TAKING, AT THE SAME TIME, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WE HAVE A SERIOUS SITUATION IN SYRIA WHICH HAS BEEN CONTINUING FOR THREE YEARS, WITH WELL OVER 20,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED. NOW WE HAVE A SERIOUS TERRORIST ATTACKS IN IRAQ AND SOUTH OF SUDAN IN CENTRAL AFRICA REPUBLIC. AND IN GAZA WE HAVE SEEN SO MUCH DEVASTATION. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO REALLY PROTECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATIONS. AND I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ALL OF THESE HOT SPOTS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, ALL AROUND THE WORLD. SOMETIMES I HAVE TO PROTECT MYSELF. AND I KNOW THAT YOU CONDUCT A LOT OF DIFFICULT INTERVIEWS, MEETING WITH THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE, I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THIS U.N. PEACEKEEPING HELMET TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
Jon: THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
KEEP IT HANDY BECAUSE-- I MAY NEED IT FOR MY PROTECTION.
Jon: YES. OKAY. IS THIS YOUR WAY OF TELLING ME I'M BEING SHIPPED OUT SOMEWHERE? OH, YEAH. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. BUT IT DOES, YOU KNOW, BOY, IT BRINGS UP A SERIOUS SITUATION, THOUGH. HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO GET WORLD OPINION ON ANY SITUATION? AND DOES THE U.N. HAVE TO CONTRACT IN SOME WAYS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS OR CAN IF CONTINUE TO-- AND WHO WITHIN THE U.N. ORGANIZATION, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY NAME NAMES BUT WHICH COUNTRY IS THE BIGGEST PAIN IN THE BUTT? (LAUGHTER)
WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS MEMBER STATES ARE UNITED...
Jon: YEAH.
UNITED NATIONS SHOULD BE UNITED.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THERE ARE SOME CASES THAT THE MEMBER STATES ARE NOT UNITED AND DIVIDED. IN SUCH CASE WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM, AS WE ARE SEEING IN SYRIA. BUT WHEN THERE IS A UNITY OF OPINION AND POSITION, WE CAN ADDRESS ALL THESE ISSUES. THIS IS THE UNSPEAKABLE TERRORIST ATTACKS...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND CRIMES WHICH ARE NOW BEING COMMITTED IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, AND ELSEWHERE. I THINK WE HAVE TO UNITE AND WE HAVE TO SHOW STRONG  SOLIDARITY TO ADDRESS THIS ONE. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, THAT ALL THE COUNTRIES, WHOEVER MAY HAVE CAPACITY, OR INFLUENCE, SHOULD DO IT.
Jon: SEE, THAT BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT. SO SYRIA, CLEARLY GASSING THEIR OWN PEOPLE, TERRIBLE DEVASTATION, THEY'RE BOMBING. BUT THE SECURITY COUNCIL COULD NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON-- NOW THERE WAS A WAY OF DISARMING THEM OF THEIR CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING INTO THERE IS A NEW REPORT ON THAT. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING ANY MORE, OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW, EBOLA IS BAD, OR WE NEED TO HELP THEM, YOU KNOW, HUMANITARIAN TYPE ISSUES, WHERE YOU WILL GET THE TYPE OF AGREEMENT THAT YOU NEED. AND EVEN WHEN RESOLUTIONS ARE PASSED, DO PEOPLE JUST IGNORE THEM? IS THERE STILL THE RESPECT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AS AN INSTITUTION, AND THE TEETH BEHIND IT TO MAKE THAT EFFECTIVE?
OVERALL, YOU SHOULD HAVE GREAT RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR WHAT UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN DOING FOR MAINTAINING PEACE AND SECURITY. AND DEVELOPMENT FOR POOR PEOPLE, AND ALSO HUMAN RIGHTS. I THINK WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB DURING THE LAST 70 YEARS. BUT IN THE CASE OF SYRIA OR SOME OTHER AREAS, WHEN THE SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE NOT UNITED, THEN WE ARE SEEING THAT TRAGIC SITUATION CONTINUING. THAT WE HAVE TO PREVENT. THAT IS WHY I'M ASKING THAT WE HAVE TO RALLY BEHIND THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, UNITED NATIONS FLAGS. WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY CASES OF EXTREMISM, RADICALISM...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND TERRORISM. AND NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY OR PERSON CAN HANDLE THIS ONE. AS THE SECRETARY OF GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS-- I CANNOT-- .
Jon: I LIKE THAT YOU WENT FOR YOUR NAME PLATE.
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE MEMBER STATES, BUT I'M REALLY DOING...
Jon: HOW DOES PRESSURE THEN, HOW DO WE PUT PRESSURE ON NATION STATES WHEN THEY FEEL A CERTAIN IMPUNITY. CERTAINLY THE UNITED NATIONS, THE UNITED STATES VETOES RESOLUTIONS WHEN IT'S NOT IN THEIR INTERESTS. RUSSIA DOES THE SAME. CHINA CAN DO IT. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE THESE LARGE SUPERPOWERS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO -- YOU HAVE YOUR GLOBAL WARMING INITIATIVES...
YES.
Jon: THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE NECESSARILY IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF OUR INABILITY TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON IT. OR DOES THAT HELP YOU? DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, BOY, WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS IN THE WORLD WE'LL ALL BE UNDER WATER IN 200 YEARS ANYWAY SO WHO CARES.
SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ALL THE POWERS.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT I THINK IT'S THE PEOPLE. IT'S THE PEOPLE. THE CIVIL SOCIETY, NGOs, THEY HAVE NOW MORE POWER, MORE VOICE, I THINK, PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY SHOULD RAISE THEIR VOICES, LOOK, MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS MY WORLD. I'M GOING TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD SO PLEASE MAKE THIS WORLD SAFE AND PROSPEROUS AND WHERE EVERYBODY'S HUMAN DIGNITY IS RESPECTED. I THINK THEY HAVE THEIR LEGITIMATE PEROGATIVE, RIGHTS. THAT IS WHY I'M ASKING OUR YOUNG GENERATION, YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS, LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT THEY CAN, YOU KNOW, GENERATE A STRONG POWER ALL AROUND THE WORLD. SO RAISE YOUR VOICE.
Jon: DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IN THE IDEALISM THAT CAN RISE UP AND SNUFF OUT THE TYPES OF EXTREMISM THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. YOU ARE STILL AN OPTIMIST?
WE HAVE TO WORK AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM. WE HAVE TO BE UNITED. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY. HOW CAN THEY BE SO BRUTAL? HOW CAN THEY BE SO CRUEL,  AS A HUMAN BEING.
Jon: YES.
WE HAVE ADDRESS THIS ONE. I'M ASKING WHOLE WORLD, REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY ONE MAY HAVE. WE HAVE TO UNITE IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY.
WELL, YOU WOULD HOPE THAT WE WILL GET TO THAT TIPPING POINT AND THERE WILL BE THAT TYPE OF GROUNDSWELL. AND I APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. I KNOW ARE YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO. YOU MAY KEEP THIS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: AND I WILL KEEP THIS.
OKAY.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. BAN KI-MOON, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
