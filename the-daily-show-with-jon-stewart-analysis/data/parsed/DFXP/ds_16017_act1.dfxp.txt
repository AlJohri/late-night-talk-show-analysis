JANUARY 31, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. UNBELIEVABLE PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. BILL GATES. BILL GATES, FORMER CEO OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION IS HERE. YOU  KNOW BILL AS  THE GUY WHO GETS A DOLLAR EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THIS. HE JUST MADE A DOLLAR. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE TURMOIL IN EGYPT OR MESS O-  SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT-O POTAMIA. MANY AMERICAN JOURNALISTS GOING OLD SCHOOL. ROLLING UP THE SLEEVES JENNINGS' STYLE. SOME FILED LIVE REPORTS AMONGST THE PEOPLE. OTHERS OFFERED COMMENTARY FROM WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A CRITICAL DISTANCE SAY, MAYBE FROM THE  MEETING OF BILLIONAIRES IN DAVOS SWITZERLAND. THE CONTRAST WAS SOMETIMES STARK.
WHAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON ARE ON THREE THINGS. HOPING WHATEVER TRANSITION THERE IS PEACEFUL.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, FRIEDMAN. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A PASS ON BEING AT DAVOS. EVEN BILLIONAIRES NEED THE OCCASIONAL HOW THE WORLD WORKS METAPHORS. BUT I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE LET THAT JACKET GO BY WITHOUT COMMENTING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, WOULD? IS THAT A LEATHER TUXEDO? IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LEATHER JACKET WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ITSELF A LEATHER JACKET. OR PERHAPS YOU BOUGHT THAT 20 YEARS AGO THINKING THAT'S HOW  WE'LL ALL DRESS IN THE FUTURE. NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS, BUT YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQ WAR IS NOW YOUR SECOND BIGGEST LAPSE IN JUDGMENT. BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE PUNDITS THINK OR ARE WEARING, HOW IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REACTING TO EVENTS ON THE GROUND? HERE IS HILLARY CLINTON PRE-I POST WEEKEND.
THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT IS STABLE AND IS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO RESPOND TO THE LEGITIMATE  NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE. WE WANT TO SEE AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, TO ECONOMIC  REFORMS EXACTLY WHAT THE PROTESTERS ARE SEEKING.
DID I SAY STABLE AND RESPONSIVE? I MEANT LEAVING. HOLY (BEEP) MAKING THE U.S. LOOK LIKE A METS' FAN AT A PHILLY GAME. GO, METS! I MEAN PHILLIES. OF COURSE EVEN THOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAS EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE PROTESTS WE  MAY HAVE SOME CREDIBILITY ISSUES WITH THE EGYPT STREET.
THESE PROTESTORS SAID THE WEAPONS USED BY THE EGYPTIAN FORCES WERE MADE IN THE USA. YOU CAN SEE IT IN THIS PHOTO OF A TEAR GAS CANNISTER USED BY THE EGYPTIAN FORCES. THE FAMILIAR "MADE IN THE USA" MARKINGS ON THE CAN.
Jon: WE WRITE THAT ON OUR TEAR GAS CANNISTERS? ARE YOU KIDDING ME. DO WE WANT PEOPLE TO HATE US? HEY YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE AN IDEA. WHY DON'T WE WRITE "MADE IN CHINA" ON OUR TEAR GAS? AND THEN WHEN WE DROP FOOD OR INVENT, I DON'T KNOW, A PILLOW CANNON, THAT WE CAN BRAND WITH  OUR LOGO. SO, PRESIDENT MUBARAK HAS LOST THE UNITED STATES, HE HAS LOST THE SUPPORT OF HIS PEOPLE. HE HAS LOST THE SUPPORT OF HIS PEOPLE'S PETS. MR. PICKLES, HOW COULD YOU TURN ON HOSNI MUBARAK? WITH ALL EYES NOW ON HIM, HOSNI MUBARAK SPOKE TO THE EGYPTIAN NATION. WOULD HE HEAR THEIR GRIEVANCES?
I ASK THE GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN TODAY. I WILL TELL THE NEW GOVERNMENT, COME TOMORROW, IN VERY SPECIFIC GOAL TO WORK WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION.
Jon: MESSAGE RECEIVED. HOSNI MUBARAK HAS HEARD YOU AND SAID, I'VE FIRED THOSE JAG- OFFS HEY, I NEVER LIKED THEM  TO BEGIN WITH. I WANTED TO GET RID OF THEM FOR YEARS. I ONLY KEPT THEM BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HIM. TAKE THE SIGNS OFF THE CATS NOW? I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. HOSNI, YOU'VE BEEN EGYPT'S DICTATOR FOR 30 YEARS NOW. NOW THE PEOPLE HAVE ISSUED A, LET'S SAY, LAST CALL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. IN FACT YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T GO TO YOUR HOME. THEY'RE PROBABLY THINKING OF LIGHTING IT ON FIRE. NOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HOSNI, LET US HELP YOU OUT WITH OUR NEW SEGMENT. IT'S TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? STAY? MOVE TO 10:00 HOPING NINE MONTHS THE SAME PEOPLE WHO KICKED YOU OUT ASK YOU TO COME BACK? EVEN MOBS DON'T MISMANAGE THINGS THAT BADLY. SO LET'S LOOK AT YOUR OPTIONS. WELL, WITH ITS VIBRANT DICTATOR TOURISM INDUSTRY, FRANCE HAS ATTRACTED AN ECLECTIC EX-PAT COMMUNITY FROM CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC'S  JEAN-BEDEL BOW KAS A, TO TUNISIA'S RECENTLY OUSTED PRESIDENT BEN ALI. THE FRENCH MAY HAVE GUILLOTINED THEIR OWN TYRANTS BUT EVERY ELSE IS INVITED TO HAVE CAKE. NOW THAT BABY DOC DUVALIER IS GIVING HAITI A SHOT, PERHAPS FRANCE IS TOO WESTERN AND TOO  CLOSE TO THE HAGUE FOR YOUR TASTES. PERHAPS YOU'D ENJOY ANOTHER EXILE HOT SPOT, THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF ARAB DICTATORS WAITING TO BEFRIEND YOU. MOST OF THEM STILL IN POWER. PLAY HANDBALL IN IDI AMIN'S PRIVATE COURT. BASQUE YEAR ROUND IN THE NATION'S 90 TO 140 DEGREE TEMPERATURES. WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN OTHER THAN OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT THAT KICKED YOU OUT. HEAD TO DUBAI'S MAN MADE WORLD ISLAND'S ARCHIPELAGO. FIND OUT WHO IS REPRESENTING THE EGYPT-SHAPED ISLAND AND STAGE YOUR OWN MINI-COUPS. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. COME ON, HOS KNEE. I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING, I LOVE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. BUT I ALSO LOVE THE OPPRESSIVE HEAT OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. WELL WITH A LITTLE SMART PLANNING, YOU CAN PITCH A TENT IN SENEGAL WHERE YOU CAN  CELEBRATE RAMADAN WITH CHAD'S FORMER DICTATOR HISSENE HABRE WHILE BASQUING IN A POOL OF  YOUR OWN SWEAT. YES, SENEGAL. WHERE THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE IS FRENCH AND THE NATIONAL DISEASE IS YELLOW FEVER WITH A  TOUCH OF MOSQUITO BORN LEPROSY. BUT IF YOU'RE STILL NOT READY TO RETIRE AT THE VIGOROUS YOUNG AGE OF 82 AND YOU WANT  TO STAY ACTIVE THERE IS AN EXCITING CASTING OPPORTUNITY I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT. IT'S A CHANCE TO LIVE IN EXILE AND COMPETE FOR BIG CASH PRIZES ON NEXT SEASON'S BIG  BROTHER BIG BROTHER EDITION. WHEN FIVE DEPOSED DICTATORS AND AMAROSA FIND OUT WHAT CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE FEELS  LIKE ON THE RECEIVING END. YOU CAN EVEN SHARE A ROOM WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR, MOAMMAR QADDAFI. OOPS. HE HASN'T BEEN OVERTHROWN. YET. YOU SEE, MR. SOON TO BE EX-PRESIDENT LOTS OF GOOD THINGS AWAIT YOU IN THIS NEW  CHAPTER OF YOUR LIFE. SO PACK YOUR BAGS. YOU KNOW WHAT? (BEEP) IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO PACK. JUST GO.
