FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". I'M JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I CAN AT LEAST DRAW LIKE A NICE CARICATURE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS -- JUST SCRIBBLES. CONGRESSWOMAN AND DNC CHAIR DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ WILL BE JOINING US. CHANCES ARE WE'LL TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE POLICY, WE'LL TALK ABOUT NSA SPYING, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE JONAS BROTHERS BREAKING UP. HOW COULD YOU DO IT AGAIN YOKO? HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH? WHY? [LAUGHTER] THEY ARE SO -- YEAH,  WAS SURPRISED WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THEY WERE TOGETHER, TOO. THIS IS WHY THE NEWS NETWORKS SERVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE. ALL THOSE ISSUES ARE COMPLEX AND WE RELY ON THE NEWS NETWORKS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT, SUBSTANCE. I'M JUST (bleep) WITH YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] THE NEWS NETWORKS ARE THERE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WHETHER YOU LOOK AT AN ISSUE FROM THE RIGHT OR FROM THE LEFT, THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO WAYS YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT ANYMORE. RECENTLY, YEAH -- [LAUGHTER] -- CNN HAS MOVED BEYOND THIS SIMPLISTIC PARTISAN WORLD VIEW TO A SIMPLISTIC-IER ONE.
THE ALL IMPORTANT U.S. RUSSIA SUMMIT OVER SYRIA ISN'T ENDING SUWHEN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD. IS THAT A GOOD THING OR BAD THING?
ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC NEWSPAPERS, "THE WASHINGTON POST" IS CHANGING HANDS, A GOOD THING OR BAD THING?
Jon: GOOD THING OR BAD THING? LET'S GO TO THE ANALYST FLIPPY THE COIN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DO YOU SAY FLIPPY? [LAUGHTER] BAD! WHAT ARE THE ODDS. BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT GOOD SLASH BAD IS LIKE BEIGE IT GOES WITH EVERYTHING. IN AN EQUALLY UNSATISFYING MANNER, LEGAL STORIES.
JODY ARIAS ON THE WITNESS STAND FOR 18 STRAIGHT DAYS. IS IT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING?
Jon: MY GUESS IS FOR 18 DAYS SHE DIDN'T GET TO KILL ANYBODY ELSE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO GO WITH GOOD THING. REMEMBER THAT COMPLICATED STORY ABOUT JP MORGAN TAKING OVER WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEAR STERNS? WATCH IT BECOME A LOT LESS COMPLICATED.
SOMEBODY NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING TO PREVENT A SYSTEMIC BREAKDOWN AND JP MORGAN TOOK OVER THOSE BANKS JUST LIKE WELLS FARGO --
CAN YOU JUST SAY IS THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, NERD! [LAUGHTER] WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY. WELL, ACTUALLY WE DO LITERALLY HAVE ALL DAY 24 HOURS 7 DAYS A WEEK. BUT STILL GOOD OR BAD! AND WEAR A TIE! [LAUGHTER] NOW WATCH WOLF BLITZER. TAKE AN ANALYST MAKING A NUANCED ARGUMENT ABOUT THE BALANCE IN THIS COUNTRY BETWEEN LIBERTY AND SECURITY. WATCH BLITZER TAKE THIS CAT TO J SCHOOL.
AFTER 9/11 I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GAVE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH EXTRAORDINARY LEEWAY TO SORT OF KEEP.
IS THAT GOOD OR BAD.
THINK ULTIMATELY IT'S A GOOD THING.
Jon: IT'S JUST NOT -- GOOD OR BAD. CAN'T BELIEVE THIS DUDE LET HIMSELF GET BLITZERED SO QUICKLY. LET'S MICHELE BACHMANN SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE IN THE TIMELY AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
LET'S GO THROUGH THESE POINTS TELL ME IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD. IS IT GOOD OR BAD THAT CHILDREN CAN BE ON THEIR PARENTS HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES UNTIL THEY REACH 26.
THESE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE BEING DONE NOW.
BUT THAT'S PART OF OBAMACARE IS THAT GOOD OR BAD? -- IS THAT GOOD OR BAD? [LAUGHTER] JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR, THAT'S MICHELE I THINK VACCINES GIVE YOU BRAIN DAMAGE BACHMAN BEING TOLD BY WOLF BLITZER TO DUMB IT DOWN. THAT'S NOT THE GAME. PLAYING GOOD OR BAD. GOOD OR BAD MICHELE. GOOD OR BAD! THIS IS NO ANCHOR VERBAL TICK. IT EXTENDS ACROSS THE NETWORK.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S REQUEST FOR A GREEN LIGHT TO STRIKE SYRIA ADDS A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION TO THE STRAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH CONGRESS. LET ME START WITH YOU, DAVID, GOOD THING, BAD THING?
Jon: SHOULD WE ATTACK SYRIA GOOD OR BAD, GO! IT'S LIKE THE WORD WENT OUT FROM CNN HQ. LOOK NOBODY WATCHES THIS NETWORK UNLESS THEY ARE IN THE AIRPORT OR GOING SOMEWHERE SO 86 THE PROFESSOR TALK AND LET THE PPEOPLE KNOW DOES THIS STORY GO IN THE HAPPY BAG OR SAD BAG. EMOTICON ME, CHOP CHOP! THESE PEOPLE HAVE PLANES TO CATCH. EVERYBODY PLAYS ALONG, EVERYBODY EXCEPT CAROL COSTELLO , THE REBEL. WATCH AS SHE LETS US KNOW THAT THE RABBIT HOLE HAS AN EXIT.
OBAMACARE THE FINAL SHOWDOWN. THE IS U.S. SUPREME COURT COULD STRIKE IT DOWN TODAY OR RULE IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  IS THAT GOOD OR BAD? IT ALL DEPENDS. THE NFL STRIKES A DEAL WITH THOUSANDS OF FORMER PLAYERS. GOOD THING? BAD THING? SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE?
Jon: WHAT IS THIS MIDDLE YOU SPEAK OF AND WHERE BE IT? BE THE MIDDLE BEYOND THE REALM WHERE THE KRAKEN REIGNS SUPREME? OR PERHAPS IS A LAND DOWN BELOW WHERE BILBO BAGGINS SCRIBBLES IN HIS REDBOOK AND ALL THE ELFS BE SURPRISINGINGLY (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] AM I ALONE ON THAT? I THOUGHT THE ELFS WERE UNBELIEVABLY ATTRACTIVE. YOU HAVE THE ORCS, NAH, THE HOBBITS THERE AND THEN THE ELFS. WHO BE THIS POINTY EARED APPARITION. TO BE FAIR CNN IS NOT THE ONLY TONETWORK IF THEY'VE ASKED IFY SOMETHING IS A GOOD THING OR BAD THING. OTHER CABLE NETWORKS DO IT AS WELL. WHEN FOX ASKS THEY KNOW THE ANSWER.
THEY SAY THAT 100 MILLION PEOPLE LOOKED UP JOHN 3:16 DURING THE FOOTBALL GAME. IS THAT A GOOD THING? I THINK IT'S A FABULOUS THING.
MAKING STUDENT LOANS MORE AFFORDABLE IS THIS A GOOD THING? BAD.
BAD.
BAD.
Jon: GOT IT. BIBLE GOOD, EDUCATION BAAAAD. WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT IF A STUDENT WANTS A LOAN TO GO TO BIBLE SCHOOL? BRAIN FREEZE! BUT, OF COURSE, MSNBC SOMETIMES ASKS AS WELL BUT SARCASTICALLY.
WISCONSIN HAS BEEN LOSING JOBS FOR SIX STRAIGHT MONTHS SINCE WALKER'S BUDGET WENT INTO EFFECT. ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION IS THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING.
WE'VE SEEN FOR THE RECORD 21 STRAIGHT MONTHS OF PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH. MR. ROMNEY IS THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING. IF THE GOVERNMENT TODAY STOPS A PENNSYLVANIA POOL FROM  KICKING OUT BLACK KIDS IS THAT A GOOD THING OR BAD THING?
Jon: THE ANSWER TO ALL THREE ARE WHAT ARE YOU (bleep) STUPID? BUT CNN, THEY GENUINELY SEEM NOT TO KNOW. GOOD THING, BAD THING? THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW. SO MUCH SO THAT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO USE THEIR PHONE-A-FRIEND LIFELINE.
GOOD THING OR BAD THING TO SHUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS. SEVEN IN TEN AMERICANS SAY A BAD THING. NEARLY SIX IN TEN AMERICANS SAY IT'S A BAD THING. NEARLY 4-10 SAY IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING REMEMBER THAT.
Jon: BUT ALSO REMEMBER THIS. NEARLY SIX IN TEN OF YOU BELIEVE IN ANGELS. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT BY REDUCING COMPLEX STORIES TO THE MOST REDUCTIVE MOOD RING ESSENCE YOU THINK WE'RE CHILDREN BUT I'M SAYING IF THIS IS THE DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING IN I CAN SAVE YOU A LOT OF MONEY ON CORRESPONDENCE. THERE WAS A WOMAN I USED TO WATCH. HER NAME IS PENNY SHE'D PERFECT FOR CNN.
MUSIC IS GOOD. HAMSTERS ARE GOOD, BIRTHDAY PARTIES ARE REAL GOOD. DRUGS ARE BAD.
