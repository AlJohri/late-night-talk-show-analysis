Jon: HEY, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BAD NEWS RECENTLY. BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BAD NEWS, RECENTLY. BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TO CELEBRATE THE GOOD NEWS.
YOUR NEW  MISS AMERICA IS MISS NEW YORK  IN NEW YORK, THE MISS NEW YORK, MAKE YOU FEEL-- NEW YORK PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE.
THAT'S HOW WE DO.
I'M AN INCREASINGLY OLD MAN.
I'M JUST REALLY PROUD.
LAST NIGHT 24-YEAR-OLD NINA DAVULURI WAS NAMED MISS AMERICA FOR 2014. SHE IS THE FIRST AMERICAN OF INDIAN DESCENT TO EVER TO WIN THE CROWN AND IS HAPPY THE PAGEANT ORGANIZATION HAS EMBRACED DIVERSITY.
Jon: YES! THE MISS AMERICA PAGEANT HAS EMBRACED DIVERSITY. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL MOSAIC OF WOMEN SIZE 0 TO NEARLY 2. IT IS A PANOPLY-- A MYRIAD, BUT STILL, GREAT NEWS FOR MISS NINA DAVULURI AND THE COUNTRY. IT WAS VERY FUN FOR ME TO REPORT JUST A SIMPLE STORY. JUST PLEASANT, A PLEASANT STORY. NOT STEEPED IN ANY CONTROVERSY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS. IT'S-- NO, THAT'S-- BUT NO, THAT'S THE BAD SHARK SOUND. HOW COULD THAT BE BAD? HOW, HOW?
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS SOME UGLY BACKLASH ON TWITTER. SOME PEOPLE CALLING HER A FOREIGNER, AN ARAB, EVEN A TERRORIST.
ANOTHER READING, MISS AMERICA, YOU MEAN MISS 7-11. AND MISS NEW YORK IS INDIAN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THIS IS AMERICA.
Jon: YES, THIS IS AMERICA. AND DO YOU KNOW HOW WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AMERICA. THE WAY YOU KNOW THAT IS THE WORD DO IS MISSPELLED. THAT IS HOW YOU KNOW THIS IS AMERICA. WELL, WHEN INDIAN NEWS STORIES FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS  OUR VERY OWN AASIF MANDVI CATCHES THEM FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL BACK IN BROWN. ♪ .
Jon: YEAH, FIRST OF ALL THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY A SONG, AASIF, I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT OFF THE TOP THIS MISS AMERICA WIN IS QUITE A MILESTONE FOR THE INDIAN COMMUNITY.
NOT A MILESTONE, JON, MORE LIKE A BEACHHEAD.
Jon: BEACHHEAD, SOUNDS LIKE A MILITARY INVASION.
DAMN RIGHT IT IS WAKE UP AND SMELL THE CURRY, JON. INDIANS ARE TAKING OVER AMERICA.
Jon: WHAT-- YOU WON ONE COMPETITION.
CLEARLY YOU HAVE NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. THIS IS ONLY THE MOST RECENT ASS-KICKING.
KNAIDEL, GERMAN DERIVED YIDDISH. K-N-A-I-D-E-L. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM! THAT'S RIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE WON WITH ONE OF YOUR WORDS, MY YIDDISHER FRIEND. TELL ME HOW MY TUCHUS TASTES!
Jon: SO YOU'RE DOMINATING OUR SPELLING AND SWIMWEAR COMPETITION.
YEAH, WE'RE NOT JUST SMARTER THAN YOU, WE'RE ALSO AMERICA'S MOST SCRUMPTIOUS EYE CANDY. WITH THE TIARA TO PROVE IT! IF YOU LIKE HER THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE  ARRANGED A MARRIAGE WITH IT, ♪ OH OH OH  ♪.
Jon: AND YET YOU DANCE LIKE A WHITE MAN. AASIF, YOU'RE NOT ANGRY AT ALL ABOUT THE BACKLASH ON TWITTER, THE RACIAL SLURS ABOUT THE 7-11.
LOOK, JON IT IS TWITTER. IT'S LIKE THAT MOVIE CRASH, YOU GOT 140 CHARACTERS AND LIKE 120 OF THEM ARE RACIST FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I MEAN SURE SOME OF US WORK IN CONVENIENCE STORES SELLING YOU THE CRAP THAT GIVES YOU DIABETES. BUT GUESS WHAT, THE REST OF US INCLUDING THE NEW MISS AMERICA ARE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL, CASHING IN ON THAT ILLNESS. DOUBLE CHA CHING. (APPLAUSE) YOU GOT WHAT WE LIKE TO SAY, YOU GOT GUPTAED. YOU SPENT ALL THIS TIME WORRYING ABOUT MEXICANS COMING OVER THE FENCE WHEN THE REAL ENEMY WAS APPROACHING FROM UNDERNEATH TO CUP YOUR BALLS AND ASK YOU TO COUGH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO I GUESS SO IT'S OVER.
YEAH, YEAH, IT'S OVER. YOU HAD A GOOD RUN. YOU TOOK THIS COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE INDIANS. AND NOW IT'S DIFFERENT GROUP OF INDIANS IS TAKING IT BACK. AASIF MANDVI VERY, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
