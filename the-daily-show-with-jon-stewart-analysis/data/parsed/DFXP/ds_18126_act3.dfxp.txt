John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACADEMY  AWARD WIFNING ACTRESS WHOSE NEW  FILM IS RED 2.
I HAVE JUST BEEN GIVEN A  CONTRACT TO KILL YOU. APPARENTLY YOU'RE GUILTY OF  NUCLEAR TERRORISM AND MURDER AND  YOU'RE NUMBER ONE ON INTERPOLL'S MOST WANTED.
WHAT DID YOU SAY? I SAID IF I DON'T SOMEBODY  ELSE WILL.
IT'S BAD. ISN'T IT?
SEND HIM MY LOVE, WILL YOU? YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY. HE GAVE HER A GUN.
WAS IT LOADED? YES. ARE YOU BEING CONTROL SOMETHING.
NO. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CHANCES IN A  RELATIONSHIP. YOU HAVE TO BE SUPPORTIVE.
John: IT'S THE MOST CLASSY  WAY TO DISPOSE OF A BODY. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  THE GREAT DAME HELEN MIIREN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I THINK YOU SHOULD CONDUCT  THE WHOLE INTERVIEW ON YOUR  KNEES ACTUALLY.
John: I'VE NOT ACTUALLY MET A  DAME BEFORE. SO AS A BRITISH PEASANT, AM I  SUPPOSED TO COURTESY OR JUST  AUTOMATICALLY GIVE YOU MY  INCOME?
NO, NO,. John: HOW DOES IT WORK. I'M PROBABLY MORE PEASANT  THAN YOU ARE.
I WENT TO NORMAL SCHOOL. THEY CALL IT SOMETHING  DIFFERENT.
THEY DON'T CALL IT PRIVATE  SCHOOL.
THEY THINK WE ALL WENT. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT, BELIEVE IT  OR NOT, I'M ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF  THE ROYAL FAMILY.
YOU DAMED UP. I DID DAME UP. I DID. I WAS VERY HONORED TO DAME UP. I THINK THAT WAS PARTLY BECAUSE  I'M THE DAUGHTER OF AN  IMMIGRANT. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,  IMMIGRANTS TO COUNTRIES, YOU  KNOW, WE GET ESPECIALLY KIND OF HONORED AND EXCITED ABOUT BEING  RECOGNIZED.
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT  WE'VE LEFT AND DONE ANYTHING. WHENEVER I GO HOME ALL MY  FRIENDS... THEY ALWAYS SAY, ALL  RIGHT, HOLLYWOOD. HOW IS BRAD PIT? I GUESS IF YOUR FRIENDS DO THAT,  THAT'S ACTUALLY A VALID  QUESTION.
I'M SURE YOU'VE MET... HAVEN'T YOU MET BRAD?
John: DO YOU KNOW HE WAS A  GUEST HERE. I DID MEET HIM. AND HE SMELLED UNBELIEVABLE. UNBELIEVABLE.
THE OTHER THING ABOUT MOVIE  STARS LIKE BRAD PITT, THEY LOOK  PERFECTLY ORDINARY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM EXCEPT IT'S BRAD PITT. OH, MY GOD, IT'S BRAD PITT. IF YOU IGNORE THAT FROM THE NECK  DOWN THEY LOOK KIND OF ORDINARY. THEY HAVE A T-SHIRT ON OR A  JACKET OR SOMETHING. BUT IF YOU GET TO TOUCH THEM,  THEY FEEL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEIR CLOTHES  ARE MADE OF SUCH INCREDIBLE  FABRIC. SO AN ORDINARY JACKET YOU TOUCH  AND YOU REALIZE IT'S LIKE THE  MOST EXPENSIVE CASHMERE YOU'VE EVER TOUCHED IN YOUR LIFE. I ALWAYS TRY AND TOUCH MOVIE  STARS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SNON I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. BUT THAT ANIMAL IS EXTINCT NOW. RED 2 IS OUT THIS WEEK.
IT IS. John: QUITE A MOVE GOING TOE  TO TOE WITH THE RELEASE OF THE  NEW ROYAL BABY.
YES. BUT MAYBE MORE LAUGHS IN OUR  MOVIE. I DON'T KNOW.
IT IS REALLY ENJOYABLE. THE FIRST ONE WAS FAMOUS FOR  HAVING A CAR SPINNING AROUND IN  IT.
THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THERE'S THREE CAR  SPINS.
CLASSIC STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD,  ISN'T IT? A THREE-CAR SPIN, THREE TIMES  THE MONEY.
I'M IN ONE OF THOSE CAR  SPINS. IT WAS GREAT SHOOTING IT BECAUSE  YOU DON'T DO THAT IN REAL LIFE. SURPRISE, SURPRISE. YOU'RE IN THE STUDIO AND THE CAR  IS LITERALLY ON A THING THAT  GOES ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND UNTIL YOU FEEL COMPLETELY SICK  BUT IT WAS FUN.
John: WHAT IS IT LIKE MEETING  THE QUEEN?
WELL, I MEAN, I HAVE MET THE  QUEEN.
WHEN YOU GOT DAMED. I GOT DAMED BY CHARLES. THAT DOESN'T COUNT THEN. BUT ANYWAY, IT WASN'T THE  QUEEN BUT I HAD MET THE QUEEN ON  OTHER OCCASIONS BUT NOT... NOT IN AN INTIMATE SITUATION  PARTICULARLY. HAVING A CUP OF TEA, NOT LIKE  THAT.
THE FIRST TIME DID IT FEEL  STRANGE? YOU ARE THE LADY FROM...
ABSOLUTELY. OH, BUT IT IS LIKE MEETING MOVIE  STARS. YOU CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT THAT  THERE'S THAT INCREDIBLY FAMOUS  FACE LOOKING AT YOU. IT'S SO HARD. I CALL IT QUEENITIS. YOU GET QUEENITIS. FIRST OF ALL, YOU START TALKING  LIKE THIS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
IT'S HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO  SOUND.
YOU START SAYING TERRIBLY. IT'S SUCH FUN. WHY AM I TALKING LIKE THAT? YOU KEEP SAYING SHUT UP. JUST BE NORMAL. BE NORMAL. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
RED 2 WILL BE IN THE THEATERS  ON FRIDAY. IT SUCH FUN. IT IS SUCH FUN. DAME HELEN M
