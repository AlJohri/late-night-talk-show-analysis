WELCOME BACK. AMERICAN MILITARY IS THE  GREATEST FORCE IN THE WORLD,  OTHER THAN MAYBE GRAVITY BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  DISTURBING REVELATIONS OF  LATE.
MAY WAS A BAD MONTH FOR  ITS MILITARY. THERE WERE A SERIES OF  INCIDENTS THAT REVEALED A  SEXUAL ASSAULT PROBLEM THAT  APPEARED OUT OF CONTROL.
SEXUAL ABUSE ACCIDENTS  ARE INCREASING, 26,000  REPORTED LAST YEAR.
26,000, YOU KNOW WHAT,  THAT IS PRECISELY 27,000  MORE INCIDENTS THAN THERE SHOULD BE. BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE  NEGATIVE 1,000 SEXUAL ABUSE  INCIDENTS WHEN IT COMES TO  INVOLVING OUR MILITARY  PERSONNEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AFTER EVERYTHING THEY DO  FOR OUR COUNTRY THEY DESERVE  MAGICAL, MAJESTIC CONSENSUAL SEX WITH UNICORNS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, TO HIS  CREDIT, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS  MADE IT CLEAR THAT WILL NOT TOLERATE SEXUAL ASSAULT.
WE FIND OUT SOMEBODY IS  ENGAGING IN THIS STUFF, THEY  HAVE GOT TO BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE. PROSECUTED, STRIPPED OF  THEIR POSITIONS,  COURT-MARTIALED, FIRED,  DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED,  PERIOD.
WELL SAID. WELL SAID. PERIOD. PERSONALLY, I ALSO WOULD  HAVE GONE WITH AN  EXCLAMATION POINT AFTER THAT  PERIOD. MAYBE AN ELLIPSIS TO CREATE  SUSPENSE AND FROWNY EMOTICON  BUT WE BASICALLY AGREE. WE BASICALLY AGREE. THIS IS CLEARLY A GOOD  THING. STATEMENTS THIS STRONG FROM  THE COMMAND NEVER CHIEF CAN  ONLY BRING THE PROBLEM TO A QUICKER RESOLUTION WITH  ABSOLUTELY NO UNINTENDED  CONSEQUENCES.
A MILITARY JUDGE WHOSE  HEARING A PAIR OF SEXUAL  ASSAULT CASES SAYS HE'S BEEN HAMSTRUNG BY STATEMENTS FROM  PRESIDENT OBAMA BECAUSE WHAT  HE CALLS UNLAWFUL COMMAND  INFLUENCE.
THE IMPACT OF PRESIDENT  OBAMA'S COMMENTS ABOUT  SEXUAL ASSAULT, SAYING THEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED,  STRIPPED OF THEIR POSITIONED,  COURT-MARTIALED, FIRED AND  DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED AND THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF  CASES WHERE MILITARY DEFENSE  LAWYERS HAVE CITED THAT AS COMMAND INFLUENCE.
WHAT? LOOK, LOOK, I'M NO BIG CITY  LAWYER. I'M NOT EVEN A SMALL TOWN  LAWYER OR INDEED, A LAWYER. BUT HOW IS THE PRESIDENT'S  UNLAWFULLY INFLUENCING A  CASE BY SAYING THAT PEOPLE  GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SHOULD BE FOUND GUILTY. HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE  MORE NEUTRAL THAN THAT, JUST,  OH, MAYBE GUILTY PEOPLE  SHOULD BE PUNISHED OR MAYBE  REWARDED. I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT REALLY MY PLACE TO  COMMENTS ON THE MILITARY AS  COMMANDER IN CHIEF. BUT ITS PRESIDENT ISN'T THE  ONLY ONE SPEAKING ON THIS. THE SITUATION HAS BECOME SO  BAD THAT CONGRESS IS  ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
AMERICA'S MOST POWERFUL  MILITARY LEADERS WERE  ORDERED TO CAPITOL HILL  TODAY TO ANSWER FOR THE EPIDEMIC OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS  IN THE RANKS.
THIS UNPRECEDENT SHOWS  LEADERSHIP AT A CAPITOL HILL  HEARING TODAY, A DOZEN TOP COMMANDERS FROM ALL FOUR  BRANCHES OF THE ARMED FORCES  WERE THERE.
WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THE  SENIOR OFFICERS WHO MARCHED  INTO THE COMMITTEE ROOM WERE ALL MEN.
OH, GOOD, GOOD. ANY TIME YOU WANT A PANEL  CONVENED TO COMBAT SEXUAL  ASSAULT, YOU WANT TO MAKE  SURE THAT IT IS FILLED WITH OLD MEN RAISED IN AN ERA  WHERE YOUR FEMALE  SECRETARIES CHRISTMAS BONUS  WITH AS A SLAP ON THE ASS. (APPLAUSE)  NOW LOOK-- ONE OF THE  SENATORS TAKING CHARGE OF  THIS ISSUE IS NEW YORK'S OWN KIR TEN GILLEBRAN. SHE IS GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO BE  WITH US HERE NOW. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW, SENATOR GILLIBRAND. GLAD FOR TO YOU BE HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SENATOR, YOU YOURSELF  HAVE A HISTORY OF TAKING ON  IMPORTANT ALBEIT NARROW BILLS LIKE, THERE IS A BILL,  DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS THAT  MADE YOU WANT TO DO  SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE  HUGE, HORRIFIC EVIDENCE.
WELL, IT REALLY WAS THE  PERSONAL STORIES OF SOME  VICTIMS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW THESE  MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT KNOCK  BUT TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY TO STAND FOR OUR VALUES AN EVEN  DIE FOR OUR COUNTRY WERE  BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS, NOT BY AN ENEMY ABROAD BUT  WITHIN THEIR OWN RANKS. AND I WAS SO HEART BROKEN  THAT THEY EVEN SAID THINGS  LIKE I COULD SURVIVE THE  RAPE BUT WHAT I CON SURVIVE WAS THE COMMANDING OFFICERS,  THE PEOPLE IN MY RANKS NOT  HAVING MY BACK, NOT  BELIEVING MEMENT AND FOR 26,000 CASES TO TAKE PLACE  LAST YEAR, IN LESS THAN 1%  PROSECUTED, IT'S OUTRAGE US. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FACED  WITH.
IS WHAT WE JUST SAW PART  OF THE PROBLEM? YOU LOOK AT THOSE OLD WHITE  PREDOMINANTLY MALE FACES. THAT YOU ARE GOING UP  AGAINST IN THE EXTREME  THERE. BECAUSE THE MILITARY IS BY  NATURE TERRITORIAL. THAT'S KIND OF ITS MO. AND THEY DON'T REALLY WANT  THE OUTSIDE FORCES ANYWHERE  NEAR THIS.
THEY DON'T WANT CHANGE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM,  WHETHER YOU LOOK AT, WHEN  THEY DEALT WITH SEGREGATION, INTEGRATION AS THE SERVICES,  WHEN IT WAS HAVING WOMEN  ENTER THE SERVICES, WHEN IT WAS ALLOWING GAYS TO SERVE  OPENLY IN THE MILITARY. EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY HAVE  OPPOSED THAT. AND THEY USED THE SAME  NARRATIVE. THEY KEEP SAYING YOU CAN'T  POSSIBLY DO THAT T WILL  SOMEHOW UNDERMINE GOOD  DISCIPLINE. I HAVE NEW FOR ITS MILITARY,  26,000 SEXUAL ASSAULTS A  YEAR IS NOT GOOD ORDER AND  DISCIPLINE. AND THEY ARE -- --  (APPLAUSE)  BUT HERE'S THE CONFUSING  THING FOR ME. BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE  OF THE MILITARY MEETING AND  BEING MARRIED TO ONE OF THEM F THERE'S ONE THING THE  MILITARY CAN DO IT'S  EVERYTHING. THEY CAN DO INCREDIBLE  THINGS. THEY ARE A MISSION-FOCUSED  GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO CAN  BUILD A TOWN IN THE MIDDLE  OF A DESERT AT NO MINUTES  NOTICE. SO IF THIS IS A SIN OF  OMISSION IN A WAY BECAUSE  THEY'RE JUST NOT-- YOU FEEL  THAT IF THEY WANTED TO FIX THIS, IT WOULD ALREADY HAVE  BEEN FIXED.
WELL, IT IS A FAILURE. BECAUSE THE COMMANDERS ARE  RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE  THAT THERE IS A COMMAND  CLIMATE WHERE THIS RAPE DOESN'T HAPPEN, WHERE A  SEXUAL ASSAULT DOESN'T  HAPPEN. THENER THERE'S ALSO  RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE  THERE IS NO RETALIATIONMENT  BUT OF THE 3,000 VICTIMS WHO DID REPORT THESE CRIMES LAST  YEAR, 62% SAID THEY WERE  RETALIATED AGAINST. SO THEY ARE FAILING TO  CREATE GOOD ORDER AND  DISCIPLINE, FAILING TO  CREATE A CLIMATE WHERE VICTIMS CAN COME FORWARD. AND WE OWE THESE MEN AND  WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING OUR  COUNTRY MUCH MORE.
RIGHT, AND WHERE --
AND THANK YOU TO YOUR  WIFE FOR HER SERVICE, GOD  BLESS HER, GOD BLESS HER (APPLAUSE)
SO WHERE IS THIS BILL? YOU HAVE HOW MANY VOTE DOES  YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW? BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY  POLITICS IS A NUMBERS GAME,  NOT A HUMAN EMOTION GAME.
WHAT THE GOAL OF THE BILL  IS, IS WITH VICTIMS TELL SUS  THEY DON'T TRUST THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. EVEN THOUGH THE COMMANDERS  YOU SHOWED A PICTURE OF,  THEY TESTIFIED, AND SAID  THEY DON'T TRUST US, THEY DON'T TRUST THE CHAIN OF  COMMAND. SO THE PROBLEM IS CLEAR. WHAT WE WANT TO CREATE IS AN  OBJECTIVE REVIEW BY A  TRAINED MILITARY PROSECUTOR, SOMEONE WITHOUT IS ACTUALLY  A LAWYER TRAINED TO WEIGH  EVIDENCE AND MAKE THE  FUNDAMENTAL DECISION, DOES THE CASE GO FORWARD. THAT DECISION TO BE  OBJECTIVE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A VICTIM,  THE PERSON IS GOING TO  DECIDE HER CASE IS HER BOSS, WHO MAY WELL KNOW HER  ASSAILANT, WHO KNOWS HER. THERE IS NO OBJECTIVITY. SO WHAT WE ARE CREATING TO  CREATE IS AN OBJECTIVE  SYSTEM AND WE HAVE ABOUT 46  SENATORS WHO ARE PUBLICLY SUPPORTING IT TODAY. WE HAVE TO GET TO AT LEAST  51.
ALL LISS THIS IS SEXUAL  ASSAULT,.
IT IS MORE THAN HALF THE  VICTIM ARE MALE, MORE THAN  HALF.
LET'S JUST MAKE THAT  CLEAR. THIS IS NOT --
NOT JUST ABOUT WOMEN,  MORE THAN HALF THE VICTIMS  ARE MALE.
NOW YOU MANAGED TO PICK  OFF ONE BY ONE SOME SENATORS,  ARE YOU INCLUDING TED CRUZ AND RAND PAUL, DOES THAT  EVEN WHERE THE LEGITIMACY OF  THIS BILL DOES THAT EVER  GIVE YOU PAUSE THINKING HOLD ON, TED CRUZ SUPPORTS THIS?
WELL, I'M VERY GRATEFUL  FOR THEIR SUPPORT. AND SOME ISSUES WERE NOT  DEMOCRATIC ISSUES OR  REPUBLICAN ISSUES.
YES.
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE  TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND I THINK THAT PRINCIPLES--   (APPLAUSE)
WE HAVE TO TAKE A QUICK  BREAK. WE'RE GOING TO BACK WITH  MORE FROM THE SENATOR AFTER  THE BREAK. SENATOR GILLEBRAND,
