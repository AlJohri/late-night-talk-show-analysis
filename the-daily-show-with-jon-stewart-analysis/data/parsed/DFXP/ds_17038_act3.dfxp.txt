WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION AT JAMES MADISON'S MONOPEELIER AND A  FELLOW FOR THE HUMANITY, HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "A SLAVE IN THE  WHITE HOUSE: PAUL JENSEN AND THE MADISONS. PLEASE WELCOME ELIZABETH DOWLING TAYLOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S CALLED "A SLAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE." YOU KNOW, IT IS SO INTERESTING  TO SEE A BOOK LIKE THIS. IN OUR CURRENT SORT OF FOUNDING FATHERS FETISH THAT WE ENJOY, THEIR INFALLIBILITY, THEIR ULTIMATE WISDOM THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK BACK TO THEM, WE FORGET  THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CREDITED WITH REALLY THE FATHER OF OUR CONSTITUTION HAD 100 SLAVES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE EIGHT EARLY PRESIDENTS WHO OWNED SLAVES DURING THEIR TENURE IN  THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: WHY DO YOU KEEP APOLOGIZING FOR AMERICA? IT'S SHOCKING TO ME BECAUSE THE IMAGE WE HAVE... BOY DOES DOLLY MADISON NOT COME OFF WELL IN  THIS BOOK. MY IMAGE OF HER WAS ALWAYS THE COURAGEOUS SAVIOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN 1812. THEN SHE WENT ON TO MAKE THOSE DELICIOUS CAKES. [LAUGHTER] SHE WAS PROUD OF HERSELF FOR RESCINDING THE OFFER OF FREEDOM TO PAUL JENNING.
WELL, SHE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH AS FIRST LADY, BUT SHE WAS A SLAVE OWNER. HER HUSBAND BEQUEATHED THE 100 SLAVES TO DOLLY. JENNINGS HAD EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD BE FREED BY MADISON'S WILL. WHEN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, DOLLY HAD A TERM IN HER WILL THAT SHE  WOULD FREE PAUL, BUT INSTEAD SHE SOLD HIM, AND THIS IS AFTER MADISON DIED AND WHILE DALI WAS  BACK IN WASHINGTON, BUT PAUL'S FAMILY, HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN, WERE OWNED BY ANOTHER MASTER, SO HE WAS SEPARATED FROM THEM AND HE DETERMINED THAT HE NEEDED TO  RAISE HIS OWN PURCHASE PRICE. SHE SET IT AT $200, AND THAT'S WHEN HE WENT TO SENATOR DANIEL WEBSTER, WHO LOANED HIM THE MONEY. AND THEN JENNINGS WORKED FOR WEBSTER TO PAY IT BACK.
Jon: THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING WE HAVE TO GET BACK THE OUR  CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. [LAUGHTER] BACK TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS. CAN YOU IMAGINE... I JUST... AS YOU READ THESE STORIES, YOU JUST IMAGINE NOW IN THE CURRENT MEDIA  ENVIRONMENT, YOU KNOW, MADISON GOING ON ONE OF THESE NEWS SHOWS AND THEM READING THEM LIKE  YOU'VE WRITTEN HERE, YOU KNOW, THE SADDEST SLAVERY OF ALL IS BEING VICIOUS FREE BLACKS WHO KEEP THE MINDS OF OWN CENTERS A  STATE OF PERPETUAL SUSPICION, FEAR AND ANGER AND YET YOU ALSO WROTE THE CONSTITUTION IS. THAT A FLIP-FLOP?
THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE FLIP-FLOP. HE WAS A COMPLICATED MAN, AND HE KNEW HIMSELF THAT SLAVERY WAS A BLOT ON OUR REPUBLICAN CHARACTER.
Jon: WAS HE... YOU KNOW, ISN'T "THEY WERE COMPLICATED MEN" AN EXCUSE FOR IN THAT AREA  OF THEIR LIVES, THEY WERE MORALLY COWARDLY?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN I APPROACH A BOOK LIKE THIS, MY PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE IS NEITHER  TO DEFEND NOR TO DENOUNCE. I REALLY WANT TO TELL PAUL JENNING'S STORY.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOING TO FLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. UNFORTUNATELY I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE A LITTLE  MORE PARTISAN AND PERNICIOUS IN YOUR WRITING. THE AMAZING THING IS THE STORY JENNINGS HAD TO THEN GO WORK. ONCE HE WAS ULTIMATELY FREED AND THEN WEBSTER DIED AND FORGAVE HIS DEBT, HE THEN HAD TO WORK TO  FREE HIS CHILDREN FROM... AND HE APPARENTLY HAD GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE MADISONS, BUT FREE HIS  CHILDREN FROM THE FAMILY THAT THE MADISONS HAD SOLD HIS CHILDREN TO.
YOU KNOW, HIS LIFE WAS A COURAGEOUS AND DELIBERATE AND SUCCESSFUL PURSUIT OF THE RIGHT  TO RISE. SO, YES, WHAT HE WANTED IS A REASONABLE FACSIMILE OF WHAT WE CALL THE AMERICAN DREAM. HE BOUGHT A PIECE OF LAND, HAD A MODEST HOUSE, MANAGED TO GET HIS CHILDREN FROM SLAVERY IN  VIRGINIA, AND THEY JOINED HIM IN WASHINGTON. AND HE HAD A LOW-LEVEL JOB WORKING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, BUT IT TOOK EVERY BIT  OF EFFORT IN THE FACE OF GALLING PATERNALISM AND CONSTANT DISCRIMINATION TO PULL THIS OFF.
Jon: IT'S REMARKABLE. THE THING THAT NOBODY REALIZES, HE WROTE NOT NECESSARILY A BOOK, BUT HE WROTE OF HIS TIME WITH THE MADISONS.
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE FIRST WHITE HOUSE MEMOIR, AND, AS YOU  KNOW, IT'S DERIGGER THESE DAYS FOR ANYONE WITH WHITE HOUSE EXPERIENCE TO PUBLISH A MEMOIR.
Jon: RIGHT. AND HE PUBLISHED, BUT YET WHY HAVE WE NEVER HEARD OF IT?
THERE WERE LIMITED NUMBER OF COPIES PRODUCED. IT'S BEEN OBSCURE ALL THIS TIME. MOREOVER, THE TITLE IS "A COLASHED MAN'S REMINISCES OF JAMES MADISON. SO IT'S MORE ABOUT THE GREAT MAN. MY STARTING QUESTION WAS WHAT ABOUT PAUL JENNINGS.
Jon: SURE, SURE, WHEN WE MAKE HIS MANUSCRIPT INTO A MOVIE, THAT WILL BE CHANGED. SOMETHING LIKE "THE HELP." I DON'T KNOW. THE STORY OF JENNINGS, YOU SPOKE WITH HIS ACTUAL RELATIVES AND WERE STUNNED AT THEIR  RECOLLECTIONS OF IT. IT REALLY WAS PASSED DOWN TO THE FAMILY, THE STORY OF THIS MAN.
IT WAS SO SATISFYING TO TRACK DOWN AND INTERVIEW HIS GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER. YOU KNOW, HE WAS BORN AT THE END OF THE 18th CENTURY. SO IN 2008, GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER, THAT'S NOT MANY GENERATIONS THERE. SHE WAS ABLE TO SHARE WITH ME THE FAMILY TRADITIONS THAT GO RIGHT BACK TO JENNINGS' TIME. FOR EXAMPLE, HE USED HIS LITERACY, IT'S UNUSUAL FOR A SLAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ AND  WRITE, BUT JEBINGS COULD, AND HE USED IT TO FORGE PASSES AND FREE PAPERS FOR SLAVES.
IT REALLY IS ONE OF THOSE REMARKABLE STORIES THAT YOU  CAN'T BELIEVE WE DON'T KNOW MORE ABOUT. IT'S A WONDERFUL THING YOU'VE DONE IN WRITING IT AND RESEARCHING IT. IT'S REALLY TERRIFIC. A SLAVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. GET IT. THE MOVIE ALL R OBVIOUSLY WITH PAUL GEE MOTI AS MADISON AND...
AND WHO HAS JENNINGS?
CUBA GOODING, JR., ODDLY ENOUGH, SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. PLEASE GET IT. ELIZABETH DOWLING TAYLOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
