DECEMBER 18, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME! TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS STILL JON STEWART. THE GUESTS TONIGHT, YOU COULDN'T HAVE TUNED IN ON A BETTER NIGHT. A LOT OF SHOWS SAY, WE'VE GOT WILL FERRELL ON THE SHOW. THAT'S TREMENDOUS. WE ALSO HAVE DAVID KOECHNER ON THE SHOW. THAT'S ALMOST TOO MUCH SHOW. PAUL RUDD WILL BE JOINING THOSE TWO, THE THREE OF THEM AND WHAT DO WE GET, THREE, WHY NOT FOUR, WHY NOT PUT STEVE CARELL ON THE SHOW, AS WELL, ALL FOUR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY? [LAUGHTER] LET'S BEGIN IN WASHINGTON. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW REGULARLY... [LAUGHTER] REALLY? NOBODY? ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE PROBABLY ACCUSTOMED TO TWO THINGS: THE DELIGHTFUL RHYME [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] AND MADDENING TALES OF WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE. WELL, TONIGHT WE HAVE TALE SO WASTEFUL, SO FRAUDULENT, SO ABUSEY, YOU CAN'T HATE THE PLAYER, YOU CAN ONLY [BLEEPED] THE GAME. WHY WOULD I SAY THAT AGAIN? THAT DOESN'T EVEN... THAT DOESN'T BELONG THERE. IT MAKES NO SENSE. JUST GO TO IT.
THIS IS THE CASE OF JOHN BEALE, WHO WAS THE HIGHEST-PAID E.P.A. OFFICIAL THERE IS AND ONE OF ITS TOP EXPERTS IN CLIMATE CHANGE WHO HAS NOW ADMITTED THROUGH HIS LAWYER THAT HE DID ABSOLUTELY NO WORK FOR YEARS BY TELLING HIS BOSSES HE WAS DOING UNDERCOVER WORK FOR THE C.I.A. IT TURNS OUT HE HAD NO AFFILIATION WITH THE C.I.A. WHATSOEVER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I TIP MY CAP TO YOU. THIS IS AMAZING. WHAT A DELICIOUS STEW OF GOVERNMENT BUGABOO, NO-SHOW JOB, A CLIMATE CHANGE GUY, LACK OF OVERSIGHT WITH JUST A SUE SONT OF BRAZEN FRAUD. YOU SAY IT'S INTERESTING, IT'S A GOOD STORY. I'M LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THIS STORY. HOOK ME.
HE TOLD HIS BOSSES THAT HE WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER FOR THE C.I.A., SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN PAKISTAN DEALING WITH THE TALIBAN. IN FACT, INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOW DISCOVERED HE WAS ACTUALLY AT HOME IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA RIDING BICYCLES, READING BOOKS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THIS IS WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL ABOUT THIS STORY: THIS MAN IS A LIAR AND BORING AS [BLEEPED]. THAT'S WHAT'S SO FASCINATING HERE. IT IS AN AMAZING FRAUD PERPETRATED BY A GUY SO HE COULD DO THINGS WE ONLY DO WHEN WE'VE RUN OUT OF OTHER THINGS TO DO. [LAUGHTER] I WILL COMMIT FRAUD AND THEN... READ A BOOK, MAYBE RIDE A BIKE. THERE'S NOTHING ON TELEVISION. THEN I'LL MAKE SOME JUICE FROM CONCENTRATE. I DON'T KNOW. SO AGAIN, IT'S BRAZEN CRIMINAL, ORDINARY LIFE. HE'S THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER [BLEEPED]. YOU KNOW, TAKE IT UP A NOTCH. FOR INSTANCE, GIVE US SOME TINY PERKS WHOSE BENEFIT IS DWARFED BY THE DICKISHNESS REQUIRED TO PROCURE IT. HOW FAR WOULD THIS MAN GO TO GET HOW LITTLE?
BEALE GOT A COVETED PARKING SPACE BY REPRESENTING THAT HE HAD MALARIA.
Jon: MALARIA! MALARIA! HE HAS TOLD PEOPLE HE HAS MALARIA SO THAT HE MAY PARK CLOSER TO THE JOB HE DOES NOT SHOW UP AT. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] AND, PRAY TELL, HOW DID THIS GENTLEMAN CONTRACT MALARIA?
MALARIA, CONTRACTED WHILE HE WAS SERVING IN VIETNAM.
Jon: I ALMOST HESITATE TO ASK, BUT...
HE DIDN'T HAVE MALARIA AND HE'D NEVER BEEN TO VIETNAM.
EXACTLY! [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Jon:, NO I SCOFF AT YOUR BOOS AND, IN FACT, SAY YAY. HE DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE. HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN A HANDICAPPED PARKING SPACE FOR A LEGITIMATE MEDICAL REASON -- HIS GIGANTIC BALLS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JUST DRIVE UP. I'M SURE HIS BOSS WOULD HAVE SAID, DON'T WORRY ABOUT PARKING, JUST DRIVE UP ON THE SIDEWALK. I DON'T WANT YOU TO DRAG THOSE MAGNIFICENT [BLEEPED] TESTICLES ON THE ASPHALT. I COULD GO ON. I COULD TALK ABOUT HOW JOHN BEALE RETIRED FROM THE E.P.A. YET CONVINCED THEM TO CONTINUE PAYING HIM BECAUSE HIS C.I.A. WORK WAS ONGOING, OR HOW HE MADE THE E.P.A. FLY HIM FIRST CLASS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE HE HAD A BAD BACK, AGAIN I'M ASSUMING BALL-RELATED. [LAUGHTER] OR WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE RETENTION BONUSES THEY PAY JOHN BEALE LEST HE LEAVE AND NOT SHOW UP AT A DIFFERENT JOB. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT ELEVATES THIS STORY FROM THE RIDICULOUS TO THE SUBLIME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU FORMER E.P.A. AIR POLICY OFFICE DIRECTOR ROBERT BRENNER, A FRIEND OF MR. BEALE'S FOR OVER 30 YEARS. HE RECRUITED MR. BEALE TO WORK AT THE E.P.A. THIS IS HOW HIS TRUST IS REPAID. HE'S GOT TO BE FURIOUS.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM, BESIDES TODAY?
I'VE SEEN MR. BEALE PERIODICALLY OVER THE LAST... WELL, ACTUALLY I'VE SEEN HIM A LOT OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.
Jon: SURE, I CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE OF COINCIDENTAL COURTROOM RUN-INS AND THAT SORT OF THING.
BECAUSE HE HAD RENTED OUT HIS HOUSE IN ARLINGTON. HE'S STAYING IN MY GUEST ROOM NOW. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, THE PRESTIGE. ENJOY.
HE'S STAYING IN MY GUEST ROOM NOW.
MR. CHAIRMAN, IS... THIS IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE STORY. I GIVE BACK.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEPED]! THIS GUY BEALE, THIS IS AMAZING. THIS GUY BEALE JUST BROKE THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. [LAUGHTER] LOOK AT HIM. HE CAN'T EVEN TAKE IT ANYMORE. HE'S LIKE, SORRY, GUYS, I GOT TO TAP OUT. LUCKY FOR HIM, THOUGH, SOMEONE ELSE IS READY TO TAP IN, BABY.
BEALE IS BEING... WAIT A MINUTE. I JUST... BEALE IS STAYING IN YOUR GUEST HOUSE?
MR. CUMMINGS, MR. BEALE NEEDED A PLACE TO LIVE IN THE AREA.
ARE YOU MARRIED? YOUR WIFE AGREED TO THAT?
YES, SHE DID.
OKAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SUDDENLY, SUDDENLY, FOR JUST THAT ONE, BRIEF, MIRACULOUS SHINING MOMENT, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, WHITE, BLACK ALL BELIEVED IN SANTA AGAIN. [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY.
JOHN, THAT STORY IS AMAZING. NOT SO MUCH THAT JOHN BEALE DID IT, BUT I THINK MAYBE THAT HE GOT AWAY WITH IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE KEY QUESTION HERE IS: HOW ON EARTH DID ALL THOSE PEOPLE FALL FOR ALL THIS C.I.A. BULL [BLEEPED].
Jon: I HAVE NO IDEA, NO IDEA.
HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A COVERT OPERATIVE IN PAKISTAN, JON, WHEN HIS NATIVE AMERICAN BACKGROUND EXPRESSLY FORBIDS HIM FROM BEING DECEPTIVE OR CROSSING BIG WATER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? NO. NATIVE AMERICANS CAN CROSS... HE'S NOT NATIVE AMERICAN.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, HE'S NOT NATIVE AMERICAN? JON, HE'S THE GREAT, GREAT GRANDSON OF SITTING BULL.
Jon: JOHN, THAT SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER LIE.
REALLY, JON? IF THAT'S A LIE, THEN THIS IS PROBABLY JUST SOME CHEAP COSTUME FROM HALLOWEEN SHOP AND NOT A PRICELESS TRIBAL HEIRLOOM THAT BEALE GAVE TO ME OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS CHEROKEE HEART.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL... SITTING BULL...
I GUESS IT'S ALL A LIE TO YOU, ISN'T IT?
Jon: SITTING BULL WASN'T CHEROKEE. HE WAS LAKOTA, SIOUX. THAT'S GOT A PRICE TAG ON IT.
APPARENTLY HIS PEOPLE USE EVERY PART OF THE MERCHANDISE.
Jon: HE'S LYING TO YOU. I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHY BEALE IS LYING TO YOU.
EXACTLY. WHY WOULD HE, JON, WHY WOULD THE 1983 WIMBLEDON CHAMPION HAVE TO LIE? HE DOES NOT.
Jon: JOHN McENROE WON WIMBLEDON IN 1983.
OH, PLEASE. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT JOHN McENROE TELLS YOU, JON? I HAPPEN TO HAVE JOHN BEALE'S WIMBLEDON TROPHY.
Jon: THAT'S A DIXIE CUP!
EXCUSE ME, JON, I'M BRITISH. I THINK I'D RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN'S SINGLES CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY.
Jon: WHAT ELSE DID THIS GUY TELL YOU, THAT HIS URINE TASTES LIKE CHAMPAGNE? OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU DIDN'T!
I'M A JOURNALIST, JON, WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A CLAIM LIKE, THAT YOU FACT CHECK IT. YOU FACT CHECK IT, JON! YOU DO IT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU OPEN WIDE AND YOUR VERIFY.
Jon: SO?
IT WAS A BIT WARMER THAN I REMEMBER CHAMPAGNE BEING, JON. SLIGHTLY LESS FIZZY. STILL GAVE ME A WICKED HANGOVER, THOUGH. WICKED.
Jon: YOU ALMOST HAVE TO ADMIRE THIS GUY, BEALE.
I KNOW. I SHOULD BE MAD. AFTER ALL, HE URINATED DIRECTLY INTO MY MOUTH, AND YET I'M NOT. I'M JUST NOT. I'M NOT MAD AT HIM. I LIKE HIM. HE'S A CHARMING FELLOW.
Jon: I AM AWFULLY GLAD THAT YOU CLARIFIED THAT. I WAS ASSUMING THAT HE PRESENTED IT IN A GLASS.
NO, NO, NO. HE POINTED AND I... [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS IT. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY
