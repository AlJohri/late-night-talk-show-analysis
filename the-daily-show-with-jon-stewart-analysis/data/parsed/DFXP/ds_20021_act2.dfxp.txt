(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. LAW ENFORCEMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A DIFFICULT JOB BUT RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN EXAMPLES OF POLICE SHOOTING FIRST AND ASKING QUESTIONS, NOT ASKING QUESTIONS, JUST SHOOTING. THANKFULLY, ONE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO PROBLEMS, JORDAN KLEPPER HAS MORE.
CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW. WITH THE RECENT EVENTS IN FERGUSON AND EIGHT MILES AWAY FROM FERGUSON AND OVER HERE AND THERE, AND RIGHT HERE, HERE AS WELL, AND STATEN ISLAND, PRETTY OF ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, IT'S NO WONDER MANY COMMUNITIES LIKE THIS ONE IN NEW JERSEY HAVE LOST FAITH IN THE POLICE.
I'M MORE AFRAID OF THE POLICE THAN I AM OF CRIMINALS.
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT.
THEY NEED TO TRAIN ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE COMMUNITY.
THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS AT THE END OF THE PANEL, WHAT ARE YOUR GUYS' THOUGHTS.
I'M NOT A COP
YEAH, WE'RE JUST WHITE.
SO YOU ARE JUST WHITE GUYS AND YOU STILL DON'T LIKE THE POLICE.
I WANT TO LIKE THE POLICE BUT I'VE DEALT WITH THE POLICE. SO IT'S HARD.
OKAY, LET ME LOOK INTO THIS.
HOW DO POLICE RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST. ONE DEPARTMENT IS TACKLING THE PROBLEM HEAD ON BY LAUNCHING A BRAND-NEW SENSITIVITY TRAINING PROGRAM. OFFICER PHIL CROCHET OF THE AUSTIN PD.
WE HAD A COUPLE OF FAIRLY CONTROVERSIAL POLICE SHOOTINGS. AND MY ASSISTANT CHIEF CALLED ME AND ASKED ME IF WE COULD GET SOME KIND OF TRAINING TO TRY TO PREVENT FUTURE SHOOTINGS FROM OCCURRING.
IT IS GREAT TO HEAR THAT A POLICE DEPARTMENT IS FINALLY TAKING THE STEPS TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY FROM BEING SHOT AT.
WE ALWAYS SHOOT FOR BEST PRACTICES. WE ALWAYS TRY FOR BEST PRACTICES.
SO HOW DO YOU TRAIN OFFICERS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE AND MAYBE LESS TRIGGER HAPPY?
I MET WITH PROGRAM FOUNDER JIM OSORIO TO FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY THIS TRAINING ENTAILED.
BASICALLY THE PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY TO KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HERE IN AUSTIN, I WANT THEM TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN JUST PULLING THEIR GUN AND SHOOTING.
SHOOTING SHOULD COME WHEN?
AS A LAST RESORT. THAT'S WHY I TELL OFFICERS USE THEIR BATON. TAKE YOUR BATON OUT THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO BITE YOUR BATON FIRST.
WHAT.
EVERY ANIMAL CAN BITE.
ANIMAL IS A TOUGH TERM.
WELL, THEY'RE ALL ANIMALS.
THEY'RE NOT ALL ANIMALS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DOGS.
OH.
YOU'RE NOT TRAINING POLICE OFFICERS TO NOT SHOOT PEOPLE, IT'S TO NOT SHOOT DOGS.
EXACTLY
NOW, I SEE. OH, THAT'S SO SAD.
BUT WHY DOGS. MAYBE MARGO FRASER OF THE AUSTIN POLICE MONITOR WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER.
THERE IS MORE REACTION WHEN A DOG IS SHOT, AS FAR AS PUBLIC OUTCRY, AS FAR AS CALLING OUR OFFICE THAN WHEN IT'S A HUMAN BEING THE PHONE SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY GETS SHUT DOWN.
THAT'S WHEN-- PEOPLE START CALLING.
THAT'S WHEN THE CALLS COME.
HOW COULD HUMANS CARE MORE ABOUT DOGS THAN OTHER HUMAN-- AWWW, LOOK AT THIS CUTIE. JUST ADORABLE. WHO IS A CUTIE, WHO'S A CUTIE? OH OKAY, I GET IT.
THERE'S A SPECIAL EMOTION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT DOGS.
YEAH.
WHAT IS IT? BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CUTE. THEIR WET NOSES, I LIKE THE WET NOSES,.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE A DOG PERSON.
I LOVE DOGS. KEEP YOU WARM AT NIGHT, IF YOU PUT PEANUT BUTTER ON YOUR-- THEY'RE JUST VERY LOVING.
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO PROTECT THEM AS BEST WE CAN
IF IT'S SOMEONE'S FAMILY PET WE WOULD CERTAINLY  NOT WANT TO SHOOT IT.
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU CAN'T SHOOT CATS NOW? WOULD YOU SHOOT A PARROT THAT SAID "THE AUSTIN PD ARE A BUNCH OF PUSSIES."
NO, I WOULDN'T SHOOT THAT PARROT.
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING.
IT'S TOO EARLY YET TO TELL WHAT THE NUMBERS MIGHT BE. BUT JUST THE FACT THAT WE'RE MAKING AN EFFORT, THAT PUTS US IN A BETTER LIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT A SENSITIVITY TRAINING PROGRAM FOR OFFICERS THAT DEALS WITH SHOOTING HUMANS.
WE GIVE OFFICERS A LOT OF TRAINING IN THAT REGARD. OFFICERS ARE GIVEN AN ASSIGNMENT TO GO OUT AND INTERVIEW PEOPLE, NORMALLY IT'S AN UNDERSERVED PORTION AFRICAN-AMERICAN, LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL.
YOU'RE TELLING ME IF I  JOIN THE AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT I COULD GET PAID TO OBSERVE LESBIANS?
THAT COULD BE AN ASSIGNMENT, YET.
HOW THREATENING ARE LESBIANS ON A SCALE OF  ZERO TO SEXY.
LESBIANS ARE NO THREATENING IN JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LESBIANS.
SO HOT, RIGHT?
YET SOME PEOPLE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THINK TRAINING ISN'T ENOUGH.
SENSITIVITY TRAINING THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE IS A JOKE
IT IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM SO I THINK THAT ANY SOLUTION YOU ARE GOING GET IS GOING TO COME ALONG SIDE A CULTURAL SHIFT.
BUT CULTURAL SHIFTS TAKE DECADES. IF ONLY THERE WAS A QUICKER WAY TO MAKE PEOPLE AS SYMPATHETIC AND HUGGABLE AS DOGS-- WAIT A MINUTE, THAT'S IT. FINALLY, A BULLETPROOF SOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE TARGETS OF POLICE BULLETS KEEP IT SAFE, DOGGIE STYLE (APPLAUSE) JORDAN KLEPPER, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
