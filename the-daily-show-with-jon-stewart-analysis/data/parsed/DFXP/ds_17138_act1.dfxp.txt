Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" I'M JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT THE AUTHOR JOANNA BROOKS -- THAT WOMAN KNOWS WHO IT IS. THE BOOK OF MORMON GIRL. I PRONOUNCED IT WRONG IT'S THE BOOK OF MORMON, GIRL!
WE WANT TO TALK BAY COMMENT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THE PRESIDENT CRITIQUING MITT ROMNEY'S TAX PLAN A NEW NAME FOR HIM THAT IS A BIT OF A BUZZ WORD. LET'S LISTEN.
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US WHAT AN ITALIAN WIDOW WEARS TO A LOBSTER BAKE. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T BELIEVE IT NOT MY ANTONIO. HE WAS SUCH A GOOD BOY. I'LL HAVE IT AT TWO POUNDS BROILED NOT STEAMED. ANTONIO. IF YOU LIKE THAT YOU'LL LOVE MY NEW ONE MAN SHOW TYLER PERRY PRENTZ JON STEWART IN WOMEN  EATING SHELLFISH. LET'S BE SERIOUS. WE'LL HEAR WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS.
HE ASKED THE MIDDLE CLASS TO PAY MORE TAXES TO GIVE ANOTHER $250,000 TAX CUT TO THE PEOPLE  MAKING MORE THAN $3 MILLION A YEAR.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
IT'S LIKE ROBINHOOD IN REVERSE. IT'S ROMNEY HOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
STEPHEN: --
Jon: SHOULD BE EASY FOR ROMNEY TO TOP ROMNEY HOOD.
WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY THINGS ABOUT ME AND MY POLICIES  AND THE IF I WERE TO COIN A TERM IT WOULD BE OBAMA-LONEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HOW CAN A GUY THAT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE DON DRAPER BE SO BAD AT WRITING AD COPY. EVERYBODY LOVES ABOUT A LONISM TRY FOR A NEAT NO ONE LIKES OBAMA'S LOAF. THAT'S AN INSULT. MAYBE THEY HIT YOU BACK WITH PASTRAM-NEY. AND COUNTER BACK WITH ABOUT A BARACK-LOAF. I THINK PUN TIME IS OVER. RAISE YOUR GAIN.
WHEN MITT ROMNEY CLOSED BAIN. I LOST MY HEALTH CARE. MY WIFE BECOME ILL AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR HER. SHE PASSED AWAY IN 22 DAYS. I DO NOT THINK MITT ROMNEY REALIZED WHAT HE HAS DONE TO ANYONE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. DON'T DANCE AROUND ROMNEY HOOD. OBAMA-LONEY. MITT ROMNEY KILLED THAT GUY'S WIFE. WHO IS FULL OF OBAMA-LONEY NOW WHITE KILLER ROMNEY. TAKE A BOW SUPER PAC GUY WHO MADE THAT AD.
HOW CAN YOU IMPLY THAT MITT ROMNEY AND BAIN ARE TO BLAME FOR THAT WOMAN DYING OF CANCER.
MY GOODNESS WE DON'T AND WOULD NOT.
Jon: HOW COULD YOU THINK SO LITTLE OF ME. ANDERSON COOPER YOU ARE A CAD AND A BOUNDER OF HIGHEST ORDER AND I THANK TO YOU FETCH MY COACH. GOOD DAY, SIMPLE BURTON WHY ARE YOU BEING COY SAY IT. MITT ROMNEY GIVES WIVES CANCER.
THE POINT IS TO TELL THE IMPACT THAT MITT ROMNEY HAD ON THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WHEN HE CAME TO TOWN THEY LOST THEIR JOBS, HEALTH CARE AND PENSION BEST -- BENEFITS AND  THAT IS STILL FELT.
Jon: STOP THE (bleep). MITT ROMNEY IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF WIFE CANCER. OWN IT. IF BURTON WON'T STAND BEHIND THE AD MAYBE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY CARNEY WILL.
I WONDER IF THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES MITT ROMNEY SHARES RESPONSIBILITY IN THE DEATH.
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE AD I CAN'T RESPOND IT TO.
CARNEY TOLD ME HE MAY LOOK AT THE AD BUT IF I ASKED ABOUT IT  HE WOULD SAY MY ASSESSMENT IS I HAVE NO ASSESSMENT.
Jon: YOU ARE TRULY AS CRAFTY AS THE CIRCUS PEOPLE WHO BEAR YOUR NAME, JAY CARNEY. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T THINK YOU'LL ESCAPE THE WRATH OF TEAM ROMNEY.
OBVIOUSLY IT'S UNFORTUNATE WHEN ANYONE LOSES THEIR JOB. IT WAS A PLANT CLOSED YEARS AFTER GOVERNOR ROMNEY LEFT THE COMPANY.
Jon: WHO WHO OF COURSE HE WASN'T IN DAY-TO-DAY CONTROL OF  BAIN WHEN HE WAS LAID OFF AND -- THAT IS NOT THE POINT. THEY SAY YOUR MAN ROMNEY IS RUNNING AROUND KILLING LADIES. WHAT SAY YOU?
AND TO THAT POINT, YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE  HAD BEEN IN MASSACHUSETTS UNDER GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S HEALTH CARE PLAN THEY  WOULD HAVE HAD HEALTH CARE.
Jon: YOU DONE (bleep) UP NOW. NO, NO, NO, NO. WHAT? YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS FULL FORCE FACE PUNCH IS, WELL, IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THE  GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROVIDE EVERYONE DESERVES HEALTH CARE VOTE FOR THE GUY WHO DESIGNED  THE PLAN MITT ROMNEY. CONSERVATIVE FREAK THREE, TWO.
THE CONSERVATIVE EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF RED STATE TWEETED OMG THIS MIGHT BE THE  MOMENT THAT MITT ROMNEY LOST THE ELECTION.
Jon: OMG I DIDN'T KNOW THE GUY WHO RUNS RED STATE.COM IS A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL. MITT ROMNEY HAS PUT UP DISADVANTAGE ELECTORALLY TTYLXOX. SHOW HIM A REAL MAN REACTS.
ANYONE WHO DONATES TO MITT ROMNEY OUGHT TO CALL HIM AND SAY IF ANDREA IS NOT FIRED AND OFF  THE CAMPAIGN THEY ARE NOT GIVING ANOTHER DIME. IT'S NOT WORTH FIGHTING FOR THIS MAN IF THIS IS THE HELP HE HAS. A RESPONSE TO THIS BY CITING HEALTH CARE IN MASSACHUSETTS.
Jon: THIS WHOLE THING MAKES ME UNLIKABLE. I MEAN MAD, I MEANT MAD AND AND COULTER DREW BACK THE CURTAIN AND REVEALED THE GREAT AND  POWERFUL OZ.
IT'S NOT WORTH FIGHTING FOR THIS MAN IF THIS IS THE SPOKESMAN HE HAS. THERE'S POINT IN YOU DOING YOUR SHOW.
A DEGREE WITH YOU.
WE THERE'S NO POINT IN PUSH FOR THIS MAN IF HE IS EMPLOYING MORONS LIKE THIS.
Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS MAKING A MOVE WE  DON'T AGREE WITH AND I'M MAD BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING SO HARD  TO PUSH FOR HIM BUT HE CONTINUES TO GO OFF THE MESSAGE YOU DESIGNED. SHE'S A PART TIME CONTRIBUTOR PUNDIT ORHANITY. HE'S A SQUARE HEADED LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR ROGER ALE'S POST-IT NOTES. HE'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE COACH FROM FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS ATE G. GORDON LIDDY. WOULD YOU NEVER FIND A NEWS PERSON AT FOX BEING TOLD BY ONE OF FOX'S IN-HOUSE POLITICAL OP  PRA ACTIVES THAT EVEN DISCUSSING THIS AD IS NOT FOLLOWING THE CORRECT NARRATIVE.
IT MAY BE SEEN BY ONLY A FEW PEOPLE SHOWN A FEW TIMES AND MORE ATTENTION GIVEN TO IT ON  THE NATIONAL MEDIA BY PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOURS COMPING THIS ACTUALLY SEEN BY ORDINARY PEOPLE.
I GUESS YOU ARE RIGHT. MAYBE I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS.
Jon: WHAT? CARL, YOU ARE RIGHT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THAT. YOU ARE SO FAR AHEAD OF ME. YOU IDIOT, IDIOT. BEFORE I REPORT A STORY I SHOULD CONSIDER HOW IT MIGHT DAMAGE OUR ULTIMATE POLITICAL GOAL. KARL ROVE I FORGET WHO IS IN CHARGE HERE. DON'T DO THAT THING WHERE YOU MAKE MY THROAT CLOSE FROM A DISTANCE. UNDERSTAND THIS:  KARL ROVE IS NOT A CRUEL OVERLORD. YOU CAN TEMPER JUSTICE WITH MERCY.
I'M GLAD YOU DID. IT DRAW AS TENSION TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE OVER-THE-TOP AND DESPERATE.
Jon: OH, THANK YOU. I WILL NOT FAIL YOU AGAIN SIRE. I WILL CUT OFF MY FINGERS A ASYMBOL OF LOYALTY. OFF! AHHH. COME ON YOU PUSSY /  STAND STAND UP.   THIS SHOWS THEY ARE DESPERATE. FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE BOYS. OBAMA'S SUPER PAC IS SAYING ROMNEY IS KILLING PEOPLE. YOU NEED TO STEP UM.
BARACK OBAMA PROMISES US CHANGE BUT SINCE HIS ELECTION THE ONLY CHANGE WE'VE SEEN IS  THIS AND THIS. AND THIS. ♪ THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND ♪ SINCE. BARACK BECAME PRESIDENT WE HAVE LOST 75% OF OUR GOLDEN GIRLS AND ONE DESIGNING WOMAN. SO VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY. DON'T LET OBAMA FINISH THE JOB.
I'M SCARED TO DEATH IF YOU MUST KNOW.
SUPPORTED BY AMERICANS IN FAVOR OF KEEPING BETTY WHITE ALIVE. 2008 WAS NOT IN BARACK. 'S PRESIDENCY BUT
