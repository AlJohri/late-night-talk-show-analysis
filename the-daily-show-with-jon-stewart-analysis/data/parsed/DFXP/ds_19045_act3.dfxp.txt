[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ACADEMY -- HE'S AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNING DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER. HIS NEW ONE IS CALLED GOD LOVES UGANDA.  THE GOVERNMENT IS THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY  TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO. RIGHT NOW, THE LAW SAYS NO HOMOSEXUAL IN THIS NATION. IT'S AN ABOMINATION TO GOD. I WILL STAND IN AGREEMENT THEY SHOULDN'T OPEN THE DOORS BECAUSE GOD DOESN'T WANT IT. HE WANTS IT STOPPED. AND UGANDA IS TRYING TO TAKE A POSITION.
HALLELUJAH.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW ROGER ROSS WILLIAMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO, SIR. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GREAT TO BE HERE.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: IT'S A REMARKABLE FILM. THIS IS A FILM ABOUT THE AMERICAN EVANGELICAL MOVEMENT, OR AT LEAST ONE PARTICULAR BRANCH OF IT, PROSELYTIZING IN UGANDA.
YES, IT IS.
Jon: YOU GOT INVOLVED HOW?
WELL, I GREW UP IN THE CHURCH. SO I JUST READ ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN UGANDA. I READ THAT THERE WAS A LAW TO MAKE HOMOSEXUALITY PUNISHABLE BY DEATH, BUT I READ THAT AMERICANS WERE BEHIND IT. SO I WENT THERE. I WENT THERE, I MET DAVID KATO WHO IS A SLAIN ACTIVIST  AND HE SAID THIS IS A STORY THAT HASN'T BEEN TOLD IN UGANDA. AND THAT'S HOW I STARTED.
Jon: IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY. NOW, WHEN YOU CONTACTED THEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE ACCESS TO THIS MOVEMENT OF EVANGELICALS, HOW DID YOU MAKE YOUR PITCH TO THEM?
I SAID, LOOK, I GREW UP IN THE CHURCH. I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND SPEAKING IN TONGUES. I UNDERSTAND THE PASSION, I UNDERSTAND THE END TIMES BUT HOW DOES THAT TRANSLATE INTO LIKE KILLING PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE? THAT'S WHAT WAS AMAZING TO ME. SO I WENT TO THEM AND I SAID I GREW UP IN THE CHURCH SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND -- I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR -- WHAT'S BEHIND ALL THIS? WHY UGANDA?
Jon: WAS THERE ANY PART, YOU KNOW, I'M CURIOUS. THEY VERY CLEARLY HAVE TAKEN A STANCE AGAINST -- IN THE MOVIE HOMOSEXUALITY THREE THINGS, HOMOSEXUALITY, ABORTION AND ISLAM.
THE THREAT OF ISLAM.
Jon: THE THREAT, I'M SORRY, NOT ISLAM BUT THE THREAT OF ISLAM. THEY'VE TAKEN A STAND AGAINST THIS. ARE THEY AWARE-- YOU KNOW,  CHRISTIANS REALLY ARE PERSECUTED IN CERTAIN PLACES CERTAINLY LIKE NORTH KOREA AND THAT. ARE THEY AWARE OF THE SORT OF IRONY OF PERSECUTING PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE WHILE FIGHTING AGAINST PERSECUTION FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SELF AWARENESS.
Jon: THAT NEVER CAME -- THAT NEVER?
NO, I THINK THAT THEY'RE SO DRIVEN BY WHAT THEY  CONSIDER BIBLICAL LAW. THEY'RE SO DRIVEN BY THE END TIMES ABOUT ERADICATING SIN, THAT'S THAT IS WHAT DRIVES THEM.
Jon: SO THE IDEA FOR THEM IS IF WE ERADICATE HOMOSEXUALITY IN UGANDA, JESUS COMES BACK. THIS IS THE CONNECTION THAT THEY'RE DRAWING.
YES, IT STARTS IN UGANDA, RIGHT?  IT STARTS IN AFRICA.
Jon: SURE, SURE. IT DID ULTIMATELY START THERE, I GUESS.
IT DID ULTIMATELY START IN AFRICA, YOU ARE RIGHT.
Jon: NIGERIA, THE PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA RECENTLY I THINK IT WAS TODAY SIGNED THAT VERY LAW. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING? WHERE IS THE INTENSITY AND THE IMPETUS COMING FROM? IS IT FROM AMERICA?
IT'S COMING FROM AMERICA. IT'S AMERICAN LEADERS WHO FEEL THEY ARE TOTALLY FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT IS GOING ON IN AMERICA. THEY'VE LOST THE CULTURE WAR IN AMERICA. AS MARRIAGE EQUALITY IS PASSED STATE BY STATE, THE RECENT SUPREME COURT RULING. SO THEY ARE FRUSTRATED SO THEY GO TO UGANDA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: DID YOU -- YOU TALK ABOUT THEM AS THOUGH THEY HAVE BIG HEARTS AND THEY'RE GOOD  PEOPLE. DO YOU LIKE THEM?
YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING, I ACTUALLY REALLY LEARNED TO LIKE ALL THE PEOPLE IN MY FILM. I THINK THAT THE WALLS THAT DIVIDED US CAME DOWN. THERE'S A LOT OF MISSIONARIES WHO ARE  DOING GOOD WORK IN AFRICA. IT'S JUST A FEW. IT'S PEOPLE LIKE SCOTT LIVELY WHO WENT TO AFRICA, WHO SAYS THAT THE NAZI MOVEMENT WAS A GAY MOVEMENT. HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE PINK SWASTIKA.
Jon: I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH, THE UNIFORMS ARE PRISTINE IN THE NAZIS. CERTAINLY SOMEONE HAD A HAND [LAUGHTER] DID THEY LEARN TO LIKE YOU?
I THINK SO. YOU KNOW WHAT, JOANNA WATSON IN THE FILM, WHO YOU SAW IN THE CLIP, WHEN I FIRST MET HER  SHE SAID, ROGER I THINK GAY PEOPLE SHOULD GO TO PRISON. AT THE END, I SAID, JOANNA DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GO TO PRISON? SHE'S LIKE, NO, I LOVE YOU ROGER. SO RIGHT THERE, SHE CHANGED, EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS HER OWN ISSUES WITH HER OWN SEXUALITY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHEN I WATCHED THAT THE TERMINOLOGY SHE USED I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING. SHE SAID, IT HAS TO BECAUSE IT'S AN ABOMINATION. AND HAVING READ THE BIBLE BECAUSE I DO STAY IN A LOT OF  HOTELS. [LAUGHTER] THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW IN THE SAME CHAPTER EATING SHELLFISH IS AN ABOMINATION. AND IS THERE ANY SENSE-- BECAUSE THERE ARE TEN COMMANDMENTS, AND THAT'S NOT IN ONE OF THEM, SO WHY THE FOCUS ON THIS?
I THINK A CERTAIN TYPE OF FUNDAMENTALIST EVANGELICALS ARE OBSESSED WITH SEX. YOU KNOW THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. YOU KNOW AT IHOP, THEY HAVE A NO PORNOGRAPHY RULE--
Jon: IHOP IS THE NAME OF THE CHURCH, NOT THE PANCAKE HOUSE. NOT THE PANCAKE HOUSE. IT'S THE CHURCH IN MY FILM.
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A BUDDY SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO BASICALLY MONITOR EACH OTHER SO YOU DON'T LOOK AT PORN.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO MONITOR EACH OTHER SO YOU DON'T LOOK AT PORN?  YEAH. >>DO THEY KNOW THAT THAT IS A FORM OF PORNOGRAPHY? [ LAUGHTER ]
EXACTLY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
I JUST FOUND UGANDA'S THE THIRD-- GOOGLE JUST CAME OUT WITH A STUDY THAT UGANDA IS THE THIRD COUNTRY OUT OF THE TOP THREE COUNTRIES, THE THIRD COUNTRY  TO WATCH GAY PORN.
Jon: ONE OF THE TOP THREE  IS UGANDA?
UGANDA.
Jon: WOW. THIS GOOGLE STUDY, IT DOESN'T NAME NAMES, DOES IT? [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, I MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE MYSELF.
Jon: BUT THE FILM NOW YOU FIND OUT ON THURSDAY IF YOU'VE BEEN NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR. YOU ARE ON THE SHORT LIST FOR AN OSCAR NOMINATED DOCUMENTARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Jon: "GOD LOVES UGANDA," SELECT CITIES, ROGER ROSS WILLIAMS.
