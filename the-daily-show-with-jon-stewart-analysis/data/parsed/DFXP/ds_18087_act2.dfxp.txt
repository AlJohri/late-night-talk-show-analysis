(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE WAR  ON TERROR FOR, I DON'T KNOW,  SEEMS LIKE A MILLION YEARS NOW. IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT GIVES  YOU HOPE IT'S THAT EVEN IN THE  DARKEST DAYS WE NEVER LOST THIS COUNTRY'S MORAL COMPASS.
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT  FAULTER.
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT  TORTURE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS TOLD  EVERYONE THAT HE WILL NOT ALLOW  TORTURE.
WE DON'T TORTURE. Jon: WE MIGHT BE ENGAGED IN A  LITTLE ROUGH HOUSING, A LITTLE  (MUMBLING) WE HAVE) MUMBLING) ONE TIME WE TICKLED SOMEBODY. KNOW BIG DEAL. ANYWAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT STUFF HAD TO BE DONE.
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT THE  ACTIONS I'VE TAKEN WERE  NECESSARY TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR  PEACE. THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE. WE'LL SEE WHAT HISTORY SAYS
Jon: ADDING... YOU KNOW WHAT? FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH IS RIGHT. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT  HIS SOAR SAYS.
Jon: HOLD ON. IT'S HISTORY CALLING. I HAVE TO GET THIS QUICK. JUST GIVE ME A SEVMENT. C. YEAH, OKAY. HE'S RIGHT HERE. IT'S FOR YOU.
INDEPENDENT TASK FORCE ON  POST 9/11 INTERROGATION  TECHNIQUES ISSUED A SCATHING REPORT TUESDAY. IT CONCLUDED THAT THE HIGHEST  U.S. OFFICIALS UNDER THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION BORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IT  CALLED THE INDISPUTABLE USE OF  TORTURE.
Jon: INDISPUTABLE USE OF  TORTURE. NO, NO. WHAT PART OF "WE DON'T TORTURE"  DOES THIS INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN  TASK FORCE NOT UNDERSTAND? I MEAN... ALL RIGHT. THIS ISN'T TOO BIG A SURPRISE. WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN ONE OR TWO  REALLY REALLY BAD GUYS HAD THEIR  INTERROGATIONS IN HAND.
I THINK IF ANYONE TAKES TIME  TO READ THE REPORT THEY WILL BE  OVERWHELMED BY THE VOLUME OF EPISODES WHERE REPRESENTATIVES  OF OUR GOVERNMENT, OUR MILITARY  BRUTALLY, BRUTALLY TORTURED MANY, MANY PEOPLE.
AMERICAN PERSONNEL CONDUCTED  AN EVEN LARGER NUMBER OF  INTERROGATIONS THAT INVOLVED CRUEL, INHUMANE OR DEGRADING  TREATMENT.
Jon: COME ON. THEY WERE OUR GUESTS. WE GAVE THEM WATER. WE JUST... DIDN'T GIVE IT TO  THEM IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY THAT  PEOPLE (CROWD GROANING) SO IT TURNS OUT WE DIDN'T JUST  LOSE OUR MORAL COMPASS, WE  SMASHED IT TO SMITHEREENS. I GUESS THE ONLY SILVER LINING  IS LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH SAID  TORTURE GOT US THAT GREAT  INFORMATION. WE'RE ALL SO MUCH SAFER BECAUSE  OF IT.
ON TOP OF ALL OF IT, THE  COMMISSION FOUND NO EVIDENCE  THAT TORTURE EVER YIELDED ANY KEY INFORMATION, NO INFORMATION  THAT WE ARE ANY SAFER BECAUSE OF  IT.
Jon: SO WHAT ARE THE LESSONS  WE CAN DRAW FROM THIS REPORT?
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE AS  A NATION HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT. I LOOK BACK IN HISTORY TO THE  TIME DURING WORLD WAR II THAT WE  INTERNED IN JAPAN  HE'S-AMERICANS. AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE THE  RIGHT AND PROPER THING TO DO. BUT IN THE LIGHT OF HISTORY, IT  WAS AN ERROR
Jon: I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND. I JUST NEED TO GO BACK REAL  QUICK.
HELLO, JOHN  Jon: HEY, IS THIS GEORGE  TAKEI?
HI, HOW ARE YOU? Jon: VERY WELL, SIR. HOW ARE YOU?
JUST GREAT  on: IT'S JON STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   VERY NICE. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU.
YES  Jon: WHEN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS  OLD AND YOUR FAMILY WERE TAKEN  FROM YOUR HOME AND PLACED IN AN INTERMENT CAMP FOR  JAPANNESE-AMERICANS, AT THE TIME  DID THAT SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT AND PROPER THING TO DO?
NO. IT DID NOT.
Jon: OKAY. THANKS A LOT, GEORGE.
ANY TIME, JON  Jon: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   SEE, THINK ABOUT A MORAL  COMPASS. IF YOU TAKE IT OUT AND SHAKE IT  FROM TIME TO TIME YOU DON'T HAVE  TO WAIT FOR HISTORY TO TELL YOU YOU'RE FACING THE WRONG  DIRECTION. WE'LL BE RIGHT
