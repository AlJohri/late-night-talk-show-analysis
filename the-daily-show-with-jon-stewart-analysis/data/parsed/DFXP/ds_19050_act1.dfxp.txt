FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BOOM. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR THERESA PAYTON. SHE'S HERE TO TALK ABOUT BIG DATA AND HOW YOUR EVERY WAKING MOVE AND THOUGHT ARE IN NO WAY BEING TRACKED BY OUR FACELESS CORPORATE OVERLORDS. HEY, WELCOME TO FROZEN, THE DISNEY FEATURE STARRING THE SNOWMAN. NOT A GOOD TIME IN NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW. BUT FIRST APROPOS, THE SOCHI WINTER OLYMPIAD, ONLY WEEKS AWAY. THE GAME'S HOST NATION HAS OPENED ITS ARMS TO THE WORLD, 90% OF THE WORLD.
IN RUSSIA THE HOST OF THE 2014 WINTER OLYMPICS THE TARGETING AND ABUSE OF HOMOSEXUALS IS AMONG THE WORST IN THE WORLD. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS SAY THOSE SPEAKING OUT FOR GAY RIGHTS ARE BEING ROUTINELY BEATEN AS POLICE LOOK ON, OR SOMETIMES, BY THE POLICE THEMSELVES.
Jon: WELL THERE'S A 2014  OLYMPIC TOURISM MOTTO, RUSSIA: WHERE THE POLICE DON'T ALWAYS HELP THE PEOPLE BEATING YOU. [LAUGHTER] CLEARLY RUSSIA ISN'T JUST GEARING UP FOR THE TRADITIONAL OLYMPIC GAMES BUT ALSO MAKING A STRONG BID TO WIN GOLD AT A CONCURRENT GLOBAL COMPETITION. â™ª
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THAT FIFTH RING. NOW, THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE HOMOPHOBIC OLYMPICS IS THAT JUST LIKE THE REGULAR OLYMPICS EVERY NATION CAN TAKE PART. LIKE WHEN JAMAICA FIELDED A BOBSLED TEAM OR SAUDI ARABIA COMPETED IN WOMEN'S BEACH VOLLEYBALL. [LAUGHTER] VERY WARM. SO LET'S GO AROUND THE GLOBE AND MEET THIS YEAR'S HOMOPHOBIC HOPEFULS, STARTING IN ASIA. INDIA HAS AGAIN CRIMINALIZED HOMOSEXUALITY. OFFENDERS IN INDIA CAN BE SENT TO JAIL FOR TEN YEARS.
Jon: YES BECAUSE TRADITIONAL INDIAN CULTURE HAS ALWAYS HELD THAT SEX IS MEANT TO BE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHOSE APPARENTLY BEING SUSPENDED BY TWO OTHER WOMEN WEARING NIPPLE CHAINS OVER THE PENIS OF THE MAN WHO IS UPSIDE DOWN AT THE TIME -- [LAUGHTER] -- WHILE THOUGHTFULLY MASSAGING THE ASSISTANT WOMAN'S GENITALIA. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT THAT WEIRD GAY (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] TEN YEARS IN PRISON FOR COMMITTING GAY ACTS CLEARLY WINS INDIA A PLACE IN THIS YEAR'S HOMOPHOBIC COMPETITION. THE REAL ACTION IS IN THE AFRICAN QUALIFYING GROUPS WHERE TWO COUNTRIES ARE BATTLING IT OUT FOR THE LAST SPOT. OGAY PEOPLE IN NIGERIA NOW CAN BE JAILED JUST FOR GATHERING WITH EACH OTHER. FOR PARTING OR MEETING ANY ASSOCIATES WHATSOEVER.
Jon: STRONG OPENING MOVE. GOOD NEWS FOR NIGERIA'S HOMOPHOBE TEAM. BAD NEWS FOR LAGOS' PRODUCTION OF KINKY BOOTS. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THAT IS HAPPENING, BUT... SO IN NIGERIA, GAY PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN MEET UP. HOW DO YOU TOP THAT?
UGANDA RECENTLY PASSED A BILL THAT MAKES HOMOSEXUALITY A CRIME PUNISHABLE BY LIFE IN PRISON.
Jon: AND UGANDA TAKES THE LEAD BY MOVING BACKWARDS. NIGERIA ARE YOU GOING TO INTOLERATE THAT?
ANYONE WHO HELPS A GAY PERSON OR PATRONIZES OR OPERATES ANY TYPE OF GAY ORGANIZATION CAN BE PROSECUTED.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep)! [LAUGHTER] NOT JUST GAY PEOPLE ANYBODY WHO HELPS -- THEY ARE NOT JUST GOING AFTER WILL, NOW THEY ARE GOING AFTER GRACE? [ LAUGHTER ] NIGERIA -- [  APPLAUSE  ] -- YES, I BELIEVE THEY ARE APPLAUDING. I REMEMBER THAT SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ] NIGERIA ON THEIR WAY BUT STILL CLEARLY THE GAY PHOBIC COUNTRY TO BEAT THIS YEAR IS MOTHER RUSSIA. THEY'VE GOT HOMEFIELD ADVANTAGE AND A STAR WHO HAS BEEN MAKING A REAL NAME FOR HIMSELF VLADMIR PUTIN A MAN EQUALLY AT HOME HORSEBACK RIDING OR HUNTING OR SPEAKING AT A FUNERAL. [ LAUGHTER ] ANOTHER THING I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER ABOUT GRANDPA. WHAT A CONTRAST IN STYLES YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE. THE AFRICAN BRAND OF HOMOPHOBIA: AGGRESSIVE, ATTACKING, SLASHING. LITERALLY. THE RUSSIANS MORE STRATEGIC, THEY ARE CHESS PLAYERS, SUBTLER, ALMOST SEEMING TO DISAVOW THEIR ANTI-GAY BIAS UNTIL THE LAST CRUCIAL SECOND.
WE AREN'T BANNING ANYTHING. WE AREN'T ROUNDING UP ANYONE. WE HAVE NO CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT FOR SUCH RELATIONS.
Jon: THERE'S VLADMIR PUTIN
GORGEOUS HEAD FAKE TOWARDS TOLERANCE, AND NOW LET'S WATCH HIM DROP THE HAMMER.
SO ONE CAN FEEL RELAXED AND AT EASE, BUT PLEASE LEAVE THE CHILDREN IN PEACE.
Jon: OHH DOCTOR! THAT HAS GOT TO GUARANTEE GOLD IN THE PRESTIGIOUS GAY PEOPLE-PEDOPHILE CONFLATION EVENT. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT PUTIN? THAT'S LIKE ME SAYING WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH RUSSIANS JUST PLEASE IF YOU COME HERE DON'T (bleep) OUR BEARS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE LOVE RUSSIANS THEY ARE VERY NICE PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] JUST WE LIKE OUR BEARS NOT TO BE PENETRATED BY RUSSIAN PENISES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT IS -- IT IS A GOOD POINT, VLADMIR, WHEN YOU SAY PLEASE LEAVE THE CHILDREN IN PEACE. WHAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT? WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO WALK UP TO A SMALL BOY YOU HAVE NEVER MET, LIFT UP HIS SHIRT AND MAYBE KISS HIS BARE TORSO? IS THAT THE CREEPY BEHAVIOR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR OLYMPICS CORRESPONDENT AASIF MANDVI IN SOCHI RIGHT NOW. AASIF THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: WOW THAT IS SOME REALLY IMPRESSIVE HOMOPHOBIA BEING SHOWCASED OUT THERE. >>YEAH IT'S TRUE, LOOKS AS THOUGH MOTHER RUSSIA IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THIS COMPETITION BUT DON'T COUNT OUT AMERICA'S HOMOPHOBIA. TEAM USA HAS BEEN REGRESSING ALL WINTER AND I THINK WE HAVE A  SHOT.
Jon: I GOT TO TELL YOU AASIF, IN OTHER YEARS I WOULD SAY, YES, BUT THIS YEAR WITH THIS LEVEL OF COMPETITION THERE'S NO WAY. THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES, RUSSIA IS TOO STRONG.
OHHH, YE OF LITTLE BIGOTRY. WE HAVE GOT A STRONG FIELD. YOUNG REALITY STAR JUAN PABLO GALAVIS OF THE BACHELOR. [READING TEXT]
USA! USA! USA!
Jon: NO, NO, DON'T ENCOURAGE-- YOU STACK THAT UP AGAINST LIFE IMPRISONMENT I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN SEE THAT GUY MAKING THE FINALS.
WELL, OK TO BE FAIR THE GLARING GAFFE IS NOT HIS EVENT. CHECK OUT HIS ENTRY IN THE 100 METER BACKTRACK.
GALAVIS RELEASED A STATEMENT ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE SAYING THE WORD PERVERT WAS NOT WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS THAT  GAY PEOPLE ARE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND INTENSE AND FOR A SEGMENT OF THIS TV AUDIENCE THIS WOULD BE TOO RACY TO ACCEPT.
Jon: TOO RACY TO ACCEPT? THE (bleep) GUY IS ON THE BACHELOR. IS HE SAYING TWO PEOPLE OF THE SAME GENDER FALLING IN LOVE IS TOO RACY? AMERICANS PREFER SEEING A DUDE SERIALLY BANGING 20 DIFFERENT GIRLS HE JUST MET IN A HOT TUB TO WHITTLE THEM DOWN TO THE ONE HE WILL ULTIMATELY BREAK UP WITH VIA TABLOID MAGAZINE.
RIGHT, TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
Jon: RIGHT. DOES TEAM USA HAVE ANY OTHER STRONG PROSPECTS?
WELL ABSOLUTELY, JON.  A UTAH MAN IS PROMISING TO GO WITHOUT ANY FOOD UNTIL THE STATE STOPS ALLOWING SAME-SEX MARRIAGES. HIS NAME IS  TRESTAN MEACHUM. HE SURVIVED FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS ONLY ON WATER AND AN OCCASIONAL VITAMIN.
IT IS A LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO HOMOPHOBIA THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE MAHATMA GHANDI.
Jon: I THOUGHT HE WAS PROTESTING THE BRITISH COLONIZATION AND OCCUPATION OF INDIA?
JON, PLEASE, I'M INDIAN. I THINK I WOULD KNOW WHAT MAHATMA GHANDI WAS PROTESTING, OKAY?
Jon: I GOTTA TELL YOU, THIS IS RUN OF THE MILL HOMOPHOBIA RANDOM NUT JOBS AROUND THE COUNTRY DISPLAYING THEIR IGNORANCE.
NO NO, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF HATE OUT THERE.
Jon: IT'S DISSIPATING AND RAPIDLY. I DON'T EVEN THINK WE'RE GOING TO MEDAL THIS YEAR.
DON'T YOU COUNT US OUT. DON'T YOU GIVE UP ON US, PONY BOY.
Jon: SORRY PONY BOY? SUDDENLY IT'S THE OUTSIDERS? ALL RIGHT LISTEN. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, AASIF. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LAKE PLACID, HOCKEY-LIKE MIRACLE TO PULL THIS THING OUT.
WAIT, WAIT, WHAT'S THAT? OH, JON WE'VE JUST GOTTEN A LATE CALL FROM THE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA. THIS COULD BE THE ONE, ROLL IT, CHUCK.
THERE WAS A CONTROVERSIAL REMARK MADE BY A MEMBER OF YOUR LEGAL TEAM COMPARING ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE TO THE UNION OF 12 YEAR OLDS, SAYING BOTH ARE ILLEGAL. WHICH YOU CALLED INAPPROPRIATE.
IT WAS AN INAPPROPRIATE ANALOGY. I THINK A MUCH BETTER ANALOGY WOULD'VE BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER, DON'T YOU?
DO YOU BELIEVE IN IGNORANCE? DO YOU BELIEVE IN IGNORANCE?
Jon: WE CAN DO IT USA! USA! USA! USA! THANK YOU AASIF MANDVI, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
