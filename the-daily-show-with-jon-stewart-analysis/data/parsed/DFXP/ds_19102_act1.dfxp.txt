FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. KATIE COURIC IS GOING TO BE HERE. VERY EXCITED. KATIE COURIC, DISCUSSING HER NEW DOCUMENTARY "FED UP," IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. BUT, MY FRIENDS, WE ON THIS SHOW DISCUSS POLITICS AND WE HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN KNOWN TO CRITICIZE, LAMPOON-- ( LAUGHTER ) TO TAKE-- TO TAKE FUN AND POKE IT. ( LAUGHTER ) WELL, TONIGHT, WE REMOVE OUR JESTER'S CAP IN RESPECTFUL SALUTE TO DEMOCRACY ON PARADE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU THE NEW YORK STATE SENATE.
THIS BILL WOULD DESIGNATE YOGURT AS THE OFFICIAL STATE SNACK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THAT, MY FRIENDS, NEW YORK STATE SENATOR MICHAEL RANZENHOFER. AT THE BEHEST OF A LOCAL FOURTH GRADE CLASS ATTEMPTING TO BRING FORTH INTO LAW AN OFFICIAL HONOR FOR NEW YORK'S VAUNTED YOGURT INDUSTRY, IT'S WHAT'S KNOWN IN LEGISLATIVE CIRCLES AS GIMME. A NO-BRAINER. THE TYPE OF FEEL-GOOD, PRO-BUSINESS, AND PROBIOTIC--
WOULD THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A FEW QUESTIONS?
Jon:  WAIT, SPONSOR YIELD? YIELD FOR QUESTIONS? WHO DARETH RISE? ( LAUGHTER ) SENATOR RIVERA, WHAT QUIBBLE DOTH THOU PROFFER.
AS FAR AS A STATE SNACK WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DEFINING AS A SNACK HERE? ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  TOUCHE. A PHILOSOPHICAL QUERY. YOUR ANSWER, SENATOR RANZENHOFER.
I THINK IT'S SELF-EXPLANATORY. I MEAN, YOU HAVE BREAKFAST, LUNCH, AND DINNER, AND THEN YOU HAVE SNACKS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE. I BELIEVE THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. PERHAPS WE CAN MOVE ON TO A VOTE.
DID YOU CONSIDER, SAY, THE POTATO CHIP AS A POTENTIAL STATE SNACK?
NO.
DID THE SPONSOR CONSIDER RAISINS AS THE POTENTIAL OFFICIAL STATE SNACK?
NO.
DID THE SPONSOR CONSIDER, PERHAPS, PRETZELS AS THE POTENTIAL STATE-- OFFICIAL STATE SNACK?
NEVER.
Jon:  NEVER! I NEVER DID AND I NEVER SHALL! FOR THE PRETZEL IS AN ABOMINATION. TO TAKE PERFECTLY GOOD DOUGH, TO TWIST IT, TO BAKE IT WITHIN AN INCH OF ITS LIFE AND THEN TO SALT IT AS THE ROMANS DID TO CARTHAGE. IT IS OUTRAGE. IT IS AN OUTRAGE. ( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T LIKE PRETZELS. ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY, SENATOR RIVERA, YOU WEREN'T FINISHED?
WHAT IF, FOR YOU MR. PRESIDENT, THE PRETZEL WAS DIPPED IN YOGURT? WOULD THAT THEN BE CONSIDERED -- COULD WE CONSIDER THAT? THAT WOULD BE TWO IN ONE, MR. PRESIDENT? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  OH, MY GOD! THIS GUY IS BATMAN. ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT SAY YOU, SENATOR HASSELHOFF?
YOGURT WOULD BE THE STATE SNACK. THE PRETZEL WOULD NOT.
Jon:  THE PRETZEL, IF SO DIPPED, WOULD BE THE STATE SNACK CONVEYANCE, OR DELIVERY METHOD, FOR WHICH DESIGNATION I REFER TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SNACK TRANSPORTATION. I'M TELLING YOU, THIS WAS MAYBE THE BEST 40 MINUTES ANY LEGISLATIVE CHAMBER ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY HAS EVER SPENT. BUT, OF COURSE, AS ALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AN END, WE DO HAVE TO MOVE TO A VOTE.
THROUGH YOU, THE SPONSOR WOULD PLEASE YIELD.
Jon:  ARE YOU ( BLEEP ) KIDDING ME? ALL RIGHT, SENATOR, SENATOR KRUEGER.
WOULD WE NEED TO REQUIRE THAT THE STATE SNACK OF NEW YORK BE YOGURT THAT IS PRODUCED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  DEAR GOD, ANSWER HER.
IS THERE A DEFINITION OF THE KIND OF YOGURT THAT WOULD BE OUR STATE SNACK?
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FOURTH GRADERS WANTED TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGURT. ( LAUGHTER ) I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU GUYS RIGHT HERE. I'M SURE THE FOURTH GRADERS DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DO THIS PROJECT. I'M SURE THEY WEREN'T EVEN INTERESTED. I'M SURE IT WAS AN ASSIGNMENT. SOME SORT OF WEIRD INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMON CORE. I'M SURE THE KIDS ARE LIKE, "IT WAS MISS ROSSI'S IDEA! I DON'T KNOW." AND, AS FOR YOU, KRUEGER I'VE GOT NO PATIENCE FOR THIS NIT-PICKERY. NOBODY, NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR ANY MORE OF YOUR PETTY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE YOGURT BILL.
ONE OF MY POSSIBLE CONCERNS WITH SUPPORTING YOGURT AS THE NEW YORK STATE OFFICIAL SNACK IS THE ISSUE OF LACTOSE INTOLERANCE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  ON SECOND THOUGHT, I YIELD THE FLOOR. SENATOR HOOTENANNY, WHAT SAY YOU?
THERE IS SOY YOGURT, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE THE VERY PRODUCTS WHICH YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT, AND THAT'S WHY, BACK TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION, IN TERMS OF DESIGNATING A SPECIFIC TYPE OF YOGURT, YOGURT IS A VERY GENERIC AND ALL-INCLUSIVE TYPE OF PRODUCT.
Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP ). THIS GUY IS LIKE THE KEN JENNINGS OF YOGURT. HE'S GOT AN INCREDIBLY ENCYCLOPEDIC AND FLUID ARGUMENTATIVE STYLE UNTIL IT ALL CAME CRASHING DOWN.
YOU HAVE THE STATE FLOWER. WE HAVE THE STATE TREE, WHICH IS THE SUGAR MAPLE. AND LASTLY, LET ME TALK ABOUT THE STATE MUFFIN. THE STATE MUFFIN IS THE APPLE MUFFIN, WHICH WAS NAMED IN 1987. AND, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE-- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE APPLE MUFFIN IT'S NOT THE FACT THAT THE APPLE MUFFIN IS BAKED IN SYRACUSE OR THE APPLE MUFFIN IS BAKED IN NEW YORK CITY. ( LAUGHING ) IT'S THE FACT THAT, IT'S THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE APPLE MUFFIN. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YEAH. YEAH, THE APPLE MUFFIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). IT'S GOOD. IT'S NICE. YEAH, IT'S NICE. YEAH, THE APPLE-- THE APPLE MUFFIN IS FUNNY TO YOU? THE APPLE MUFFIN IS A JOKE? WHAT, IS THE APPLE MUFFIN A (bleep) CLOWN TO YOU? IS THAT IT? IS THE APPLE MUFFIN HERE TO AMUSE YOU? WHAT'S SO ( BLEEP ) FUNNY ABOUT THE NEW YORK STATE APPLE MUFFIN? SORRY. THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE WHOLE DEBATE. ( LAUGHTER ) WE GO NOW TO OUR SENIOR STATE SNACK CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS LIVE OUTSIDE THE CAPITOL BUILDING IN ALBANY.
HI.  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: JESSICA, THANKS FOR JOINING US. YOU WERE THERE, OBVIOUSLY, FOR THE ENTIRE DEBATE.
YES, I WAS.
Jon:  WHAT WAS THE FEELING INSIDE THE CHAMBER?
IT WAS CONTENTIOUS, JON. AND NOT JUST ON THE FLOOR.
RIGHT. THERE WAS ALSO THIS DRAMATIC OUTBURST FROM THE GALLERY. JUST TAKE A LOOK.
Jon:  CERTAINLY.
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION-- ( GAVEL BANGING )
I'D ASK THE SERGEANT TO REMOVE THOSE WHO ARE MAKING NOISE IN THE CHAMBER RIGHT NOW.
Jon: THAT WAS, THAT WAS, WHO-- WHO WAS CAUSING THIS DISTURBANCE, JESSICA?
THERE IS ONLY ONE GROUP THAT STAGES RADICAL PROTESTS TO DISRUPT THE PROCEEDINGS EVERY TIME YOGURT-BASED LEGISLATION IS ON THE TABLE. IT'S CODE PINKBERRY, JON.
Jon:  THANK YOU, JESSICA. JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY! I WANTED TO GIVE YOU-- I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE UPDATE. IN THE END, THE BILL PASSED 52-8. AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY, BUT BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY TAKES UP DEBATE ON STATE BILL 88994, I WANT TO REMIND THEM THAT WHEN IT COMES TO YOGURT, OBTAINING THE DESIGNATION OF STATE SNACK, I MUST REINFORCE TO OUR REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW YORK DO NOT GIVE A ( BLEEP ). ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AS FAR AS, I THINK I SPEAK FOR MANY NEW YORKERS, AS FAR AS MANY NEW YORKERS ARE CONCERNED, OUR STATE SNACK IS WHO GIVES A ( BLEEP ). A PERFECT COMPANION TO OUR STATE FLOWER. WHO ( BLEEP ) CARES. AND OUR STATE BIRD, WHICH IS THE KIND YOU FLIP. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) LOOK, EVEN-- EVEN THE FOURTH GRADERS-- EVEN THE FOURTH GRADERS WHO BROUGHT THIS UP IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE LIKE, "THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE STATE SNACK? WE'RE ALREADY BALLS DEEP IN A PAPER-MACHE VOLCANO." ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I GUESS, I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'M SORRY.
