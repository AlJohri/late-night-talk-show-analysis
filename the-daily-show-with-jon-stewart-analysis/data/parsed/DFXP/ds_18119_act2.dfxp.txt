(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
John: WELCOME BACK. THE SUPREME COURT THIS WEEK  ISSUED AN INTERESTING-- IF  OBVIOUS-- RULING.
WE TURN NOW TO THE SUPREME  COURT'S DECISION TODAY ON GENES  AND ITS IMPACT FOR PATIENTS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE JUSTICES UNANIMOUSLY RULED  THAT A COMPANY CANNOT PATENT AN  ISOLATED HUMAN GENE.
John: UM, YES, CLEARLY THEY  CAN'T. OF COURSE A CORPORATION CAN'T  PATENT HUMAN GENES. HOW DID THIS QUESTION EVEN GET  TO THE SUPREME COURT? WE DON'T LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE  BUSINESSES CAN PATENT HUMAN  GENES BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE IN A (BLEEP)ING PHILLIP K. DICK SHORT  STORY. (LAUGHTER)  AND WHAT COMPANY WOULD EVEN WANT  TO DO THIS?
THE CASE INVOLVED MYRIAD  GENETICS, A COMPANY THAT HOLDS  PATENTS ON GENES CORRELATED WITH HEREDITARY BREAST AND OVARIAN  CANCER KNOWN AS BRCA 1 AND BRCA  2. MYRIAD SELLS THE GENETIC TESTS  FOR THOSE CANCERS.
John: OH, SO THAT'S FINE. I CLEARLY MISUNDERSTOOD. IT SOUNDED BAD AT FIRST BUT IT  WAS JUST A COMPANY ATTEMPTING TO  OWN THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE SO THEY COULD PROFIT OFF  PEOPLE'S FEAR OF CANCER. OH, THAT'S FINE. FOR MORE ON THIS WE TURN TO OUR  RESIDENT DERANGED MILLIONAIRE  JOHN HODGMAN. JOHN? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  JOHN, I HAVE TO SAY, THIS SEEMS  LIKE A LOW POINT FOR CAPITALISM.
LAUGH HRAFS THANK YOU VERY  MUCH, JOHN, THAT'S VERY NICE. BUT YOU KNOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN  LOWER AND IT STINGS WE WERE SO  CLOSE THAT WE COULD PATENT GENES, WE COULD PATENT ANYTHING:  KIDNEYS, THE HUMAN HAND! JUST LAST WEEK I NEARLY LOCKED  DOWN THE PATENT ON THE MUSTACHE. (LAUGHTER)  OH! I'D BE ROLLING IN HIPSTER TRUST  FUND MONEY NOW IF IT HADN'T BEEN  FOR THOSE MEDDLING JUSTICES.
John: BUT, JOHN, THEY'RE  JUST PROTECTING OUR BASIC  GENETIC INFORMATION.
THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK  THEY'RE DOING BUT THEY'RE REALLY  JUST HOLDING GENES BACK. GENES ARE JUST ANOTHER NATURAL  RESOURCE READY TO BE EXPLOITED. LIKE CORN. WHAT IS IT IN NATURE? JUST A USELESS SIX FOOT HIGH  WEED. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THEN MONSANTO COMES ALONG  AND ELEVATES THAT PATHETIC  (BLEEP) STALK INTO A HIGHLY CALORIC GOO THAT CAN BE  GLORIOUSLY INJECTED INTO EVERY  PRODUCT AND PERSON IN THE WORLD FOR MONEY!
John: I MEAN, THAT'S  ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.
JOHN, JOHN, CALM DOWN. HAVE A DRINK OF WATER, JOHN.
John: OKAY, SURE, THANK  YOU.
PLEASE USE THE PART OF YOUR  MOUTH THAT HAS THE MOST D.N.A. IN IT. IT.
John: HOLD ON! YOU'RE TRYING TO SALE MY GENES!
I SEE. SO YOU'RE ONE OF "THEM" TRYING  TO STIFLE MY PROPRIETARY  RESEARCH. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS  RULING HAS DONE TO FREE MARKET  INNOVATION?
TODAY'S DECISION IS A BIG  BLOW TO FREE MARKET INNOVATION. THIS WATERS DOWN THE RATE OF  RETURN THAT INVESTORS GET.
LINCOLN WOULD HAVEN'T LIKED  THIS. LINCOLN WOULD HAVE WANTED THESE  PEOPLE TO BE REWARDED!
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IF ABRAHAM LINCOLN STOOD FOR  ANYTHING IT WAS THE CAPITALIST  RIGHT TO OWN AND PROFIT OFF THE HUMAN BODY. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
John: I DON'T KNOW HOW TO  EVEN BEGIN TO START TO ARGUE  WITH THAT STATEMENT.
THEN DON'T BOTHER. THE FACT IS, WITHOUT THE PROFIT  MOTIVE YOU CAN'T HAVE SCIENCE. IF INVESTORS CAN'T MAKE MONEY,  WHY WOULD ANYONE TRY TO CURE  CANCER IN THE FIRST PLACE?
John: TO CURE CANCER! I'M NOT A BUSINESSMAN BUT I  THINK IF YOU CURED CANCER YOU  WOULD STILL MAKE LOT OF MONEY!
A LOT OF MONEY BUT NOT ALL OF  THE MONEY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, HEY, JOHN, WE'RE FRIENDS. LET'S NOT ARGUE. WANT TO GO GET A MANNY PEDIDI? LET ME CLIP YOUR FINGERNAILS  INTO THESE TEST TUBES.
John: STOP TRYING TO STEAL  MY GENES.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL  LIKE? A NICE CHEEK SWAB. A REFRESHING RECTAL CREPE. WE'LL MAKE IT A SPA DAY!
John: I CANNOT EMPHASIZE  THIS EMPHATICALLY ENOUGH-- YOU  WILL NOT BE SCRAPING MY RECTUM.
OKAY, I WAS HOPING FOR A  FRESH GENETIC SAMPLE BUT I'LL  JUST HAVE TO GO WITH PLAN "B," THIS OLD BAG OF YOUR PUBIC  HAIRS. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
John: I AM PROFOUNDLY  WORRIED ABOUT IT.
SEE, JOHN, THE SUPREME COURT  DECISION LEFT ME ONE LITTLE  LOOPHOLE. NATURALLY OCCURRING GENES CAN  NOT BE PATENTED, BUT MODIFIED  GENES CAN BE. A LITTLE TINKERING WITH THESE  PUBES AND I CAN UNLOCK YOUR  BODIES FULL FINANCIAL POTENTIAL.
John: DON'T DO IT.
LOOK, JOHN, EVERYONE ADMIRES  THE PASSIBLE JOB YOU'RE DOING  HOSTING THE SHOW. (LAUGHTER).
John: THANK YOU.
BUT YOU ARE BRITISH AND  THEREFORE YOUR APPEAL IS VERY  LIMITED. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  I AM READY TO ROLL OUT A  DESIGNER JOHN OLIVER CLONE FOR  EVERY MARKET THERE THERE IS. MEET ETHNIC JOHN OLIVER.
John: OH, BOY.
HOW ABOUT VETERINARIAN JOHN  OLIVER WITH WITH W KUNG FU GRIP. THEN THERE'S THE JOHN HODGMAN  JOHN OLIVER HYBRID. AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, MALIBU  JOHN OLIVER. (LAUGHTER).
John: HEY, HEY, YOU  COULDN'T GIVE MALIBU JOHN OLIVER  AN ACTUAL TAN.
JOHN, WE TRIED EVERYTHING IN  THE LAB BUT YOUR D.N.A. REJECTS  MELANIN LIKE A WHITE GUY REJECTS  DANCING. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S AN ETHNIC JOHN OLIVER  JOKE, BY THE WAY. THAT GUY IS HILARIOUS!
John: THANK YOU, JOHN. JOHN HODGMAN, EVERYBODY. WE WILL BE BRIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND
