WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT A BEST SELLING AUTHOR  HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "PAY ANY PRICE  GREED, POWER, AND ENDLESS WAR." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO OUR PROGRAM, JAMES RISIN. SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, "THIS BOOK IS CALLED PAY ANY PRICE GREED, POWER, AND ENDLESS WAR." THE LAST TIME WAS FOR THE BOOK "STATE OF WAR " WHICH WAS SORT OF AN EXPOSE A OF WIRELESS WARRENTS, WIRETAPPING, THE N.S.A.
RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
Jon: IT WAS A POWERFUL BOOK. IT HAD A LOT OF SECRETS IN IT. I REMEMBER LEANING OVER TO YOU AFTER THE INTERVIEW AND GOING,"ARE YOU GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE FOR THIS?" AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOUR RESPONSE WAS?
I SAID NO, NO, TROUBLE AT ALL.
Jon:  TELL ME WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AFTER ME EVER SINCE FOR THAT BOOK, AND THEY'RE STILL AFTER ME, IN FACT.
Jon:  HOW-- HOW MUCH LEGAL TROUBLE ARE YOU-- ARE YOU ACTUALLY IN NOW, OR IS THIS A NUISANCE HARASSMENT TO CAUSE YOU PAUSE?
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT IF IT'S JUST A NUISANCE BECAUSE IT'S LASTED SEVEN YEARS. THEY HAVE SUBPOENAED ME THREE OR FOUR TIMES. AND THERE'S A TRIAL SCHEDULED IN JANUARY.
Jon:  A TRIAL. YOU ARE GOING TO BE ON TRIAL.
NO, THEY WANT ME TO TESTIFY IN THE TRIAL.
Jon:  OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT IT IS. YOU TESTIFY AGAINST SOME GENTLEMAN.
BUT, I DON'T KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR WHERE IT IS GOING RIGHT NOW, WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO DO. THEY SEEM LIKE THEY'RE KIND OF CONFUSED RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH ME.
Jon:  REALLY? ( LAUGHTER ) SO WHILE YOU WERE THINKING OF THAT, YOU WROTE ANOTHER BOOK.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) THAT WAS MY ANSWER TO THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon:  THIS BOOK IS A REALLY INTERESTING EXAMINATION OF THE CORRUPTION UNDERLYING OUR WAR CONFLICTS.
RIGHT.
Jon:  AND INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS.
BASICALLY WHAT I REALIZED WAS-- REMEMBER WHEN DICK CHENEY SAID THE GLOVES COME OFF. WHAT THAT REALLY MEANT WAS WE WERE GETTING RID OF ALL THE RULES THAT GOVERNED THE WAR ON TERROR, AND AT THE SAME TIME WE GOT RID OF ALL THE RULES, WE POURED HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE WAR ON TERROR. SO YOU HAD A MASSIVE ENTERPRISE WITH HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH NO RULES, AND IT'S A LOT LIKE THE BANKING CRISIS. WE HAVE HAD A NATIONAL SECURITY CRISIS AND NOBODY HAS NOTICED.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE BANKING CRISIS. WITH A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
Jon:  AND BOTH SEEMINGLY PURPOSEFUL.
YEAH.
Jon: I THINK BOTH INSTITUTIONS -- IT'S AN INTERESTING ANALOGY BECAUSE BOTH OBFUSCATE VERY MUCH IN A DETERMINED WAY, SO THAT YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
RIGHT. YEAH, AND THE SECRECY THAT'S LAYERED ON TOP OF THE WAR ON TERROR HAS MADE IT SO LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME TO WASHINGTON, CLAIM TO BE AN EXPERT ON COUNTER-TERRORISM, AND GOTTEN VERY RICH.
Jon:  RIGHT.
AND THEY ALL CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE THE SILVER BULLET TO FIND OSAMA BIN LADEN OR TO SOLVE THE WAR ON TERROR-- WHATEVER.
Jon:  RIGHT. AND THIS GET TO SOME OF THE WHISTLED BLOWERS, ALSO, THE CASE OF A FELLOW NAMED DRAKE, WHO BLEW BLEW THE WHISTLE ON GOVERNMENT EXCESS, AND THEY NEARLY PUT THAT GUY IN JAIL FOR 35 YEARS.
RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. THERE WERE, LIKE, FIVE PEOPLE AT THE N.S.A., AND AT THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE COMBINED, THAT THEY ALL THOUGHT WERE SOURCES FOR OUR STORIES IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES" ON THE N.S.A., INCLUDING TOM DRAKE, AND THEY WENT AFTER ALL OF THEM. NONE OF THEM WERE OUR SOURCES. AND THEY TURNED THEIR LIVES UPSIDE DOWN FOR YEARS.
Jon:  NOW, IT BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT BECAUSE THERE ARE, I WOULD ASSUME, YOU WOULD THINK THERE ARE LINES OF NATIONAL SECURITY THAT WE SHOULD NOT CROSS IN TERMS OF GIVING THINGS OUT.
RIGHT.
Jon:  THE QUESTION IS WHO DECIDES WHAT THOSE LINES ARE AND WHEN THEY BRING THE FULL FORCE OF THESE AGENCIES AGAINST YOU-- FOR INSTANCE, WHY IS YOUR STORY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE OTHER-- THE STORY ABOUT SPYING ON GERMANY, THE STORIES ABOUT OTHER-- WHY YOU? WHY DRAKE? WHY THESE OTHER WHISTLEBLOWERS?
WELL YOU KNOW -- I THINK THERE IS A VERY ARBITRARY SYSTEM IN PLACE NOW THAT GIVES THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AN ABILITY TO RANDOMLY AND ARBITRARILY DECIDE WHICH STORIES THEY WANT TO GO AFTER TO INVESTIGATE AND WHICH THEY DON'T. AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO CREATE IS A PATHWAY FOR ACCEPTABLE NATIONAL SECURITY JOURNALISM. IF YOU GO OUTSIDE THE ACCEPTED LIMITS OF WHAT THEY WANT PEOPLE TO REPORT ON, YOU'LL GET PUNISHED. IF YOU STAY IN THE ACCEPTED LIMITS THAT THEY WANT, YOU WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS DANGEROUS TO A DEMOCRACY, WHEN YOU HAVE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO LIMIT THROUGH THE USE OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM. AND WITHIN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, IS IT THE SPYING APPARATUS THAT DECIDES? CAN THEY CALL UP AND SAY-- CAN THE C.I.A. OR THE N.S.A. CALL UP THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND SAY, "HE MADE US VERY UPSET?"
YES, EXACTLY, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS. THE C.I.A. OR THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCY CAN FILE WHAT THEY CALL A CRIMINAL REFERRAL.
Jon:  A CRIMINAL REFERRAL.
TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT AND THAT'S WHAT GETS THE BALL ROLLING ON A LEAK INVESTIGATION IS THE C.I.A.
Jon:  LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION-- IF THE C.I.A. PURPOSEFULLY LEAKS SOMETHING OR THE N.S.A.-- I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED-- BUT IT HAPPENS.
RIGHT.
Jon:  WHO CAN THEN GO AFTER THEM?
NOBODY. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE OFFICIAL LEAKS AND UNOFFICIAL LEAKS. THE OFFICIAL LEAKS, NOBODY GOES AFTER. THE UNOFFICIAL LEAKS THAT MAKE THEM LOOK BAD OR THAT THEY DON'T LIKE, THOSE ARE THE CASES THEY PURSUE.
Jon:  DO YOU TRUST THE JOURNALISTIC COMMUNITY TO FIND THAT LINE?
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. I MEAN, BECAUSE WE-- AT THE SAME TIME, WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS CRACKDOWN ON WHISTLEBLOWERS AND REPORTERS, JOURNALISM HAS GONE THROUGH A DRAMATIC REDUCTION AND FINANCIAL CRISIS
Jon: RIGHT. AND BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS FOR THOSE-- IT'S SORT OF BEEN DEMOCRATIZED AND PEOPLE PUT THEMSELVES IN TRUE DANGERS.
RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH. RIGHT. YEAH. THE FREELANCERS IN SYRIA, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT BACKED BY ANY MAJOR ORGANIZATION.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS TIME FOR JOURNALISTS. THE INDUSTRY IS REMAKING ITSELF RIGHT NOW, AND SO THE MODELS OF HOW YOU DO THIS KIND OF REPORTING ARE BREAKING DOWN.
Jon:  IT'S-- IT'S REALLY A FASCINATING AND SLIGHTLY FRIGHTENING THING. DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTE TO STICK AROUND.
SURE.
Jon: WE'LL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT? "PAY THE PRICE," IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. JAMES RISIN.
