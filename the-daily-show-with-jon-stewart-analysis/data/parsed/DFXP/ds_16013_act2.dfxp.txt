Reporter: TURKEY CREEK, MISSISSIPPI, FOUNDED BY FREED SLAVES IN 1866, IT'S BEEN A THRIVING HAVEN FOR LOCAL BLACK  RESIDENTS WHICH MEANS A DUMPING GROUND FOR EVERYONE ELSE. FOR 150 YEARS THEIR LACK OF POLITICAL POWER HAS MADE THEM AN INVITING TARGET FOR EMINENT  DOMAIN SEIZURE AND A HANDY WASTE BIN FOR INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION, AGENT ORANGE AND  WHATEVER THE HELL DID THIS.
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST 150 YEARS. BUT INTO THE 21st CENTURY WE WERE ERASED FROM THE MAP. THAT'S THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME.
Reporter: TO PROTECT WHAT LITTLE LAND WAS LEFT THEY APPEALED TO LOCAL OFFICIALS, STATE OFFICIALS, THE NAACP, ANYBODY-- ALL TO KNOW AVAIL. BUT THEN CAME A SAVIOR.
WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP COMMUNITIES LIKE TURKEY CREEK. IT REPRESENTS A PLACE WHERE NOT JUST RESIDENT BIRDS BUT MIGRATING BIRDS THAT FLY  THROUGH HERE ON THE WAY.
Reporter: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BIRDS, THESE FEATHERED CREATURES THAT FLY IN THE SKY THAT ALSO LIVE IN TURKEY CREEK.
Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT COULD HELP PRESERVE WHAT REMAINS OF TURKEY CREEK....
YOU'RE THE MOTHER (BEEP) BIRD PEOPLE.
Reporter: THE AUDUBON SOCIETY. RESIDENTS HAD TURNED TOWARDS THE HEAVENS FOR HELP, AND THEIR PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED BY BIRDS.
WHEN OUTDOOR ENTHUSIASTS, WHEN THEY GOT INVOLVED, IT JUST CHANGED THINGS DRAMATICALLY I THINK. WE RECENTLY WERE ABLE TO FORCE A CONCESSION FROM THE STATE TO PUT 1600 ACRE INTO PERPETUAL CONSERVATION.
THANKS TO THE BIRDS.
BIRDS ARE VERY REVERED IN MISSISSIPPI.
Reporter: MORE THAN PEOPLE?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
Reporter: TO THE AUDUBON SOCIETY'S CREDIT, THEY WERE EVEN THERE AFTER HURRICANE  KATRINA RAVAGED TURKEY CREEK.
AFTER THE HURRICANE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE BUILT THOUSANDS OF THESE. INCLUDING HERE IN TURKEY CREEK.
SO AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA, YOU GOT PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND BUILD HOMES FOR THE BIRDS.
Reporter: IF ONLY THE BIRDS HAD GOTTEN HERE A LITTLE SOONER.
THIS IS ABOUT 20% OF WHAT WAS OUR HISTORIC CEMETERY.
Reporter: WHERE IS THE REST OF IT?
IT WAS BULL DOZED TO BUILD.
Reporter: SO THE ORIGINAL FREED MEN AND WOMEN WHO CREATED TURKEY CREEK ARE UNDER THIS?
THAT'S RIGHT. IF THIS HAD BEEN A LISTED, RECOGNIZED FORMALLY MAPPED OFFICIAL BIRDING AREA, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
Reporter: HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.
SURE.
Reporter: HEY THERE, REVEREND. BEEN BUSY?
TURKEY CREEK, MISSISSIPPI, MEAN ANYTHING TO US?
JUST A TOWN.
Reporter: NOBODY COULD HELP THEM BUT THE AUDUBON SOCIETY. DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE EMBARRASSED. MAYBE YOU'RE GETTING SHOWN UP BY THE BIRDS, MAN?
NO, I THINK THEY SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED THAT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO HUMAN BEINGS. THEY LISTEN TO BIRDS.
Reporter: CLEARLY THE BIRDS HAD PROVEN THEIR VALUE TO SOCIETY, BUT WHAT COULD THE  PEOPLE OFFER?
WE HELP THEM TO ELEVATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS COMMUNITY BY PROVIDING THEM SHEETS ON  HOW TO IDENTIFY BIRDS IN THEIR BACKYARD.
Reporter: YOU TAUGHT THE DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES TO COUNT BIRDS TO PROVE THAT  THEIR HOMES ARE WORTH SAFING?
I HEAR A BIRD RIGHT NOW.
Reporter: WAS THIS PLACE ALWAYS CALLED TURKEY CREEK OR DID YOU CHANGE THE NAME TO  TURKEY CREEK BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD COME HELP WHEN IT WAS CALLED THE BLACK PEOPLE'S SWAMP.
IT WAS NEVER CALLED ANYTHING BUT TURKEY CREEK BUT THAT ANONYMOUS.
Reporter: THE RESIDENTS HAVE TAKEN THE BIRDING WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM.
(BEEP) BIRDS GOT MORE POWER OR SAY-SO THAN ANYBODY.
Reporter: ALBERT'S ANALYSIS OF RACE IN AMERICA MADE ME THINK, WAS SOCIETY STILL  TREATING ME A CERTAIN WAY DUE TO THE COLOR OF MY SKIN?
Reporter: BUT WHAT IF I WEREN'T BLACK? WHAT IF I WERE GREEN?
YEAH. MIND IF I HUG YOUR LADY? ALL RIGHT, YEAH, LET'S GET A HUG HERE. OH, YEAH. THAT'S NICE. YOU'RE A NICE HUGGER. WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING THERE?
LEMONADE AND DIET COKE.
OH, I'D LOVE TO TRY THOSE LEMONADES.
Reporter: LIFE IN MISSISSIPPI WAS SIMPLY BETTER AS A BIRD. I HAD JUST ONE MORE QUESTION FOR DEREK. SERIOUSLY?
THANK GOD FOR THE BIRDS.
