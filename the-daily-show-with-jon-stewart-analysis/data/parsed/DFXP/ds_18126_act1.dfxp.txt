FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER. I AM HERE, I AM HERE TONIGHT FOR  JON STEWART. JON STEWART IS NOT HERE BECAUSE  HE HAS GROWN TIRED OF WATCHING  YOU HAVING SEX DURING HIS SHOW. THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS A TWO-WAY SCREEN. WHEREAS FOR ME I'M STILL  LEARNING THINGS FROM YOU. BUT FIRST, IF YOU WATCHEDDED  LAST NIGHT'S SHOW, YOU MIGHT  HAVE NOTICED MY INTERVIEW WITH AARON SOCKER INLOOKED A LITTLE  DIFFERENT AS DID THE MUSIC AT  THE END OF THE SHOW. WHY DID MY LITTLE DANCE THERE  JUST CAUSE YOU TO STOP HAVING  SEX? WHAT HAPPENED WAS RIGHT BEFORE  LAST NIGHT'S INTERVIEW BEGAN FOR  THE FIRST TIME EVER HERE, WE LOST ALL POWER TO OUR CAMERAS  AND THE CONTROL ROOM. NOW, MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS THAT  THE CITY WAS HAVING A BLACKOUT  BECAUSE, THE PAST TWO DAYS HERE IN NEW YORK, IT'S BEEN 100  BALL-SWEAT DEGREES OUTSIDE AND  EVERYONE HAS HAD THEIR AIR CONDITIONERS CRANKEDDED UP TO  PENGUIN HOUSE. IT TURNED OUT THAT WASN'T  ACTUALLY IT. IT WAS A COMPLETE MYSTERY UNTIL  WE CHECKED OUR IN-HOUSE SECURITY  CAMERAS THIS MORNING. TAKE A LOOK.
I HATE YOU, OLIVER. YOU'RE NOT MY REAL JON. THERE'S ONLY ONE JON WHO CAN  HOST THIS SHOW IN MY HEART. THIS IS FOR YOU, STEWART.
John: THAT MAKES SENSE. THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ON TO OUR TOP STORY. OUR TOP STORY FOR THE NIGHT. REMEMBER LAST MONTH, TEXAS STATE  SENATOR WENDY DAVIS STOOD FOR  TEN HOURS IN PINK SNEAKERS TO PROTEST HER STATE'S PROPOSED  ABORTION RESTRICTIONS. VERY DRAMATIC. VERY DRAMATIC. VERY INSPIRING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OF COURSE, IN THE END IT WAS FOR  NOTHING SINCE THE LAW PASSED A  FEW DAYS AGO, SWEEPING AWAY HER HERCULEAN EFFORT LIKE A TUMBLE  WEED TURNED ABANDONED ABORTION  CLINIC. BUT WHAT IT DID DO WAS FOCUS  EVERYONE'S ATTENTION ON ONE OF  OUR DEMOCRACY'S QUIRKIEST FEATURES, THE PHILADELPHIA PHILADELPHIA   FILIBUSTER WHICH AT THE FEDERAL  LEVEL IS MORE POPULAR THAN EVER.
UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA THERE  HAVE BEEN 16 FILIBUSTERS ON HIS  NOMINATIONS OF HIS OWN TEAM, CABINET SECRETARIES VERSUS 20 IN  THE ENTIRE HISTORY BEFORE.
ZERO FOR EISENHOWER TO FORD. CARTER AND REAGAN HAD TWO EACH  ON EXECUTIVE NOMINEES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENT  OBAMA, YOU MADE THIS POINT, 16  FOR HIS FIRST TERM. 28 PROJECTEDDED THIS TERM.
John: WOW. SO NEARLY HALF OF ALL EXECUTIVE  NOMINEE FILIBUSTERS EVER HAVE  BEEN TO BLOCK OBAMA APPOINTEES. I'VE GOT TO SAY WHEN THEY TOLD  US THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN  HISTORIC PRESIDENCY, I DON'T THINK THIS WAS REALLY WHAT  EVERYONE HAD IN MIND. NOW, THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR  THIS. ONE, CONGRESS' ENATE  DICKISHNESS. YOU CAN'T EACH THAT. TWO UNDER OPPORTUNITY RULES ALL  YOU NEED TO DO TO FILIBUSTER IS  SAYING, "I'M GOING TO FILIBUSTER."  YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND THERE  FOR 15 HOURS, HOLD YOUR PEE,  READ THE PHONE BOOK. IT'S LIKE A GOLFER STANDING AT A  TEE AND TURNING TO HIS CADDY AND  SAYING I PLAN TO HIT A HOLE IN  ONE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT ME DOWN  FOR A ONE. IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE IN BAR  HIGH FIVING. NOW THIS CURRENT RIDICULOUS  SITUATION HAS PROVEN A LITTLE  TOO MUCH FOR SOME PEOPLE.
SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE  PREPARING TO CHANGE FILIBUSTER,  INVOKING THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR  OPTION.
John: NO, NO, NOT THE NUCLEAR  OPTION. EVERYBODY, DUCK AND COVER.
INVOKING THE SO MUCH CALLED  NUCLEAR OPTION TO CHANGE SENATE  RULES SO THAT ONLY A SIMPLE MAJORITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO  CONFIRM NOMINEES FOR FEDERAL  AGENCIES' CABINET APPOINTMENTS.
John: HOLD ON, HOLD ON. SO IN THIS CONTEXT, THE NUCLEAR  OPTION IS JUST A SIMPLE CHANGE  IN PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE. THAT IS THE WORLD'S WORST JERRY  BRUCKHEIMER MOVIE. HEY, I'VE COME HERE TO CHEW  BUBBLE GUM AND TO CONFIRM SUB  CABINET LEVEL NOMINEES. GUESS WHAT? I'M ALL OUT OF BUBBLE GUM. (LAUGHING) DID THAT LOOK AS  UNCOOL AS IT FELT? BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT IT IS A  YES. IF THEY'RE CALLING IT A NUCLEAR  OPTION, THEY MUST BE TAKING THIS  PRETTY SERIOUSLY. SENATE LEADER HARRY REID, CAN  YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS MIGHT BE  NECESSARY PERHAPS WITH A BRIEF  ANALOGY.
DAVEY JOHNSON IS A MANAGER OF  THE NATIONAL METS, THE TEAM  WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE HERE IN  WASHINGTON. HE'S HERE AS MANAGER. NOW IMAGINE THE FRONT OFFICE OF  MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL CALLING UP  DAVEY JOHNSON AROUND THE FIRST OF APRIL AND SAID, DAVEY, I KNOW  THAT... I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU  CAN PLAY HIM AS SOON AS THE ALL STAR BREAK IS OVER. MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT REPUBLICANS  ARE SAYING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR TEAM UNTIL  WE TELL YOU EVERYTHING IS JUST  FINE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE US A LONG  TIME FOR US TO TELL YOU THAT.
John: YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE  THAT WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO DELAY  AN ORGASM, THEY WOULD THINK OF  BASEBALL. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU HAVE A  MUCH BETTER OPTION. YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HARRY REID  TALKING' BASEBALL. ... TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL. THAT WON'T JUST DELAY YOUR  ORGASM, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE AN  ORGASM EVER AGAIN. IT'S THE WORLD'S MOST BORING MAN  IN THE WORLD'S MOST BORING PLACE  DISCUSSING THE WORLD'S MOST BORING SPORT. IT'S LIKE AN AMBIEN STUFFED  INSIDE A LUNESTA COVERED BY A  BOTTLE OF NIQUIL. IT'S A SNORE-DUCKEN, IF YOU  WILL. NOW, THIS IS ACTUALLY A DANCE AS  OLD AS TIME BECAUSE THE MAJORITY  PARTY WANTS TO GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER WHEREAS THE OTHER  PARTY -- LET'S CALL THEM THE  MINORITY -- FIGHTS THEM TOOTH AND NAIL WHICH MEANS HARRY REID  AND THE SENIOR SENATORS FROM  KENTUCKY ARE ABOUT TO ENGAGE INTO AN ULTIMATE AGE FIGHTING.
THIS ISN'T A POWER GRAB. I DON'T KNOW WHAT A POWER GRAB  LOOKS LIKE.
NO MATTER HOW OFTEN MY FRIEND  RUDELY TALKS ABOUT ME NOT  BREAKING MY WORD, I'M NOT GOING TO RESPOND TALKING ABOUT HOW  MANY TIMES HE'S BROKEN HIS WORD.
WE DON'T PULL BACK FROM THE  BRINK HERE, MY FRIEND THE  MAJORITY LEADER IS GOING TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE WORST LEADER  OF THE SENATE EVER.
John: OWE, THE WORST EVER. McCONNELL HAS REED ON THE  ROPES. FINISH HIM.
SENATOR McCONNELL'S  CAMPAIGN TWEETED OUT THIS NET  OWE OF A TOMBSTONE WITH THE LINE "IF REED CHANGES THE RULES TO  KILL THE FILIBUSTER, KILL THE  SENATE WILL BE ON HIS TOMBSTONE."
John: McCONNELL WINS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO WITH SENATORS APPARENTLY  RIPPING ONE ANOTHER HEARTS OUT,  IT LOOKS LIKE THE SENATE IS GOING NUCLEAR. I SHOULD PROBABLY GET A FEW  THINGS OFF MY CHEST MYSELF. I HAD A GAY EXPERIENCE IN  COLLEGE. TECHNICALLY I WAS 31 BUT IT  HAPPENED AT THE COLLEGE. WHAT ELSE? I DON'T LIKE ARTICHOKES. THAT'S EMBARRASSING. AND IF ANYONE EVER DISCOVERS THE  MUTILATED BODY OF A VAGRANT.
THE SENATE HAS REACHED A DEAL  TO REACH THE SO-CALLED NUCLEAR  OPTION.
THEN I HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  TO DO WITH IT. SERIOUSLY? HOW DID THE NUCLEAR OPTION GET  AVERTED?
A SMALLER GROUP OF SENATORS  LIKE BY McCAIN AND SHEUMER  HAVE HAMMERED THIS OUT. TWO OF THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES  WILL BE WITHDRAWN. TWO NEW NAMES OFFERED AND FIVE  OTHERS WILL GO FORWARD.
John: SO A ROUTINE BIT OF  HORSE TRADING. ALL IT TOOK TO GET THERE WAS  WEEKS OF THREATS AND HYPERBOLIC  RHETORIC ABOUT ENDING THE  SENATE. I PRESUME YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL  ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.
THERE'S GOOD NEWS. WHAT IT REFLECTS IS NOT ONLY  RESPECT FOR THE SENATE RULES BUT  REALLY AN UNDERSTANDING THAT TO GET SOLUTIONS, WE'VE GOT TO WORK  IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.
THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN  IN A LONG TIME SENATORS OF BOTH  POLITICAL PEARS SIT DOWN AND HAMMER OUT AN AGREEMENT.
John: I GUESS THAT IS  TECHNICALLY BETTER. YES, WE HAVE COME TO REACH NEXT  TO NOTHING BUT WE DID IT  TOGETHER. FOR MORE ON THIS, WE TURN TO  SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL  CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES WHO IS ON THE SENATE FLOOR. JASON, THE FILIBUSTER HAS BEEN  PRESERVED FOR NOW. SO IT SEEMS WE WON'T SEE THE  PREDICTED DISSENT INTO GRIDLOCK  AND CHAOS THEN.
GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS. HOW WOULD THAT BE WORSE THAN THE  CURRENT SITUATION? THE SENATE DREAMS OF THE DAY  THINGS IMPROVE TO A STATE OF  GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS.
John: IS IT REALLY THAT BAD  THERE?
JOHN, JOHN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT  ALL THIS STUFF IS? THESE ARE SENATE BILLS WAITING  TO COME UP TO THE FLOOR FOR A  VOTE. LOOK HOW OLD THEY ARE. LOOK AT THIS THING HERE. LOOK AT THIS. THE FAIR SLAVE PRICING ACT OF  1852. THIS ONE HERE. BAN THIS NEW JAZZ CRAZE BILL. LOOK AT THIS ONE. A BILL TO GRANT THE  CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF ALL  AROUND GREAT GUYS TO O.J. [BLEEP] SIMPSON. IF THE SENATORS WERE SMART THEY  WOULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THE  FILIBUSTER COMPLETELY.
John: NOT PROPOSING TO GET  RID OF ALL FILIBUSTERS JUST ONES  BLOCKING NON-LIFETIME EXECUTIVE  APPOINTMENTS.
THAT'S TRYING TO CURB FIREARM  VIOLENCE BY BANNING T-SHIRT  GUNS. TRYING TO PUT OUT A VOLCANO BY  TAKING A PISS IN IT. THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THE OLD  SCHOOL FILIBUSTER.
John: WHEN THEY HAD TO TALK  FOR HOURS AND HOURS WITHOUT  GETTING A BATHROOM BREAK.
LIKE REAL MEN. LIKE WENDY DAVIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: I HONORLY DON'T KNOW IF  THEY CAN DO THAT, JASON. REMEMBER THESE ARE MOSTLY OLD  MEN. THERE IS NO WAY THEY CAN STAND  THERE FOR HOURS WITHOUT LEAVING  TO GET TO A BATHROOM.
Reporter: YES, THEY CAN. WE REPORTERS, WE DO IT ALL THE  TIME.
John: WHOA, WHOA, JASON,  JASON. HOW ARE YOU LOOPING THAT? JASON, WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT  DIAPER?
Reporter: I CAN'T HAVE YOU  THROW TO DEAD AIR BECAUSE I'M IN  THE BATHROOM DRAINING THE SNAKE. THE SNAKE DID DRAINED ANYWHERE. SNAKE DON'T MIND. SNAKE'S COOL.
John: PLEASE, PLEASE. STOP REFERRING TO YOUR PENIS AS  A SNAKE.
Reporter: SHHH. HE CAN HEAR YOU. BUT THE POINT IS, IF I CAN BE  OUT HERE IN A DIAPER, WHY CAN'T  MITCH McCONNELL? SNON BECAUSE THAT SEEMS BENEATH  THE DIGNITY OF THE SENATE.
Reporter: YOU REALLY THINK  MITCH McCONNELL [BLEEP] INTO  AN ADULT-SIZED HUGEES IS LESS DIGNIFIED THAN THE WAY THE  CURRENT IS OPERATING.
John: YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT A  POINT THERE,
