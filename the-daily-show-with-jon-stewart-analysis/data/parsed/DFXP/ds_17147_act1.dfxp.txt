NO,. [LAUGHTER]
ALL RIGHT ONE SURROGATE DOWN. ON AXELROD, ON COLOR, ON SWAP. DAVID CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE FOUR  YEARS AGO.
HERE'S WHAT I CAN SAY, CHRIS. I CAN SAY THAT WE'RE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO.
I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU WHAT WAS HAPPENING FOUR YEARS AGO AT THIS TIME.
LISTEN GEORGE, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE GOT INTO TERRIBLE ECONOMIC SITUATION.
NO, THEY DON'T. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. HERE'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE GETTING A FREE SANDWICH WHICH IS A GOOD REASON FOR BUYING TEN OTHER SANDWICHES.

HI, I'M CHUCK NORRIS. [LAUGHTER]
IS HE GOING TO YELL AT THE OTTOMAN.
OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND FREEDOM IS UNDER ATTACK. OUR COUNTRY AS WE KNOW IT MAY BE LOST FOREVER IF WE DON'T CHANGE  THE COURSE OUR COUNTRY'S HEADED. WE CAN NO LONGER SIT QUIETLY OR STAND ON THE SIDELINES AND WATCH OUR COUNTRY GO THE WAY OF  SOCIALISM OR SOMETHING MUCH WORSE.
WE WILL PRE SERVE FOR OUR CHILDREN THIS LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH OR WE WILL TAKE THE  FIRST STEP INTO A THOUSAND YEARS OF DARKNESS. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
I MAY NOT AGREE WITH THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY IS QUITE THAT FAR. [LAUGHTER] I JUST THINK THEY PITCHED THE PERFECT PREMISE FOR AN OFTEN CHUCK NORRIS COME BACK. THIS IS AMERICA AND A THOUSAND YEARS OF DARKNESS. [LAUGHTER] AS THAT MAN IS 72. [LAUGHTER] CHUCK NORRIS IS TEXAS RANGER. [APPLAUSE] DEMOCRATS, DEMOCRATS, HOW DO YOU GET CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED ON THE BETTER OFF QUESTION. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION AN INCUMBENT HAS FACED SINCE ONALD REAGAN LAID OUT JIMMYR  CARTER IN 1980. ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS WE HAVE AND WE WILL ONLY BE BETTER OFF UNDER THE LEADERSHIP  OF RONALD REAGAN. IT'S ALL THERE. [LAUGHTER] FOR GOD'S SAKE DEMOCRATS,. DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER, DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER OBAMA USED TO BE THE CHALLENGER? I DON'T QUOTE RONALD REAGAN THAT OFTEN, BUT LET ME ASK YOU TO SIMPLE QUESTION, ARE YOU BETTER  OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO. [LAUGHTER] DID I HAVE MEETINGS. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T SEE IT COMING FOR THE WEEKEND NEWS SHOW. FINE, NOTHING MATTERS. JUST TAKE HIM AGAIN. [LAUGHTER] AND OH WHAT A DIFFERENCE A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP CAN MAKE.
ARE WE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN WE WERE FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED. ABSOLUTELY.
WE ARE CLEARLY BETTER OFF AS A COUNTRY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT  CREATING JOBS RATHER THAN LOSING THEM.
Jon:  OH, BETTER OFF. [LAUGHTER] BUT CLEARLY THE CRACKS ARE HAVING A MORE -- THE DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING A MORE DIFFICULT  TIME -- THEY CAME TO CHARLOTTE TO LEND A HAND.
FOUR YEARS AGO AMERICA WAS FINE.
Jon:  YES. WE. CAN.
THIS SLOGAN SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF THING THAT MATTHEW BROADIC SHOUTED TO THE SOLDIERS  IN GLORY BEFORE THEY WERE SHOT TO PIECES. THE DEMOCRATS CLEARLY NEED HELP. LET'S THINK OF A SLOGAN YOU CAN PUT ON A BUMPER STICKER AND MAKE  EVERYBODY EXPOSE IT FOR THE FOUR YEARS AHEAD.
HE DIDN'T CREATE --
I DON'T LIKE IT BUT I DEFINITELY DON'T LIKE IT.
MOVING ON UP.
MOVING ON UP. [LAUGHTER]
