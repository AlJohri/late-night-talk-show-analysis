[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW YOU MAY RECALL, A PREVIOUS SEGMENT COMPRISED OF A FAIRLY DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE OMNIBUS BUDGET BILL. THE SORT OF ENTRENCHED AND POLITICAL SATIRE WE'VE COME TO BE KNOWN FOR AND WHICH IS SLOWLY KILLING ME. WHICH IS WHY THIS ACT WE'RE GOING WITH THIS.
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A DANGEROUS TIME OF YEAR. THE SOUTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY HAS A NEW AD CAMPAIGN OUT THAT'S AIMED AT KEEPING DRIVERS SAFE ON THE ROAD.
IT'S CALLED DON'T JERK AND DRIVE. [LAUGHING]
Jon: OH, YEAH. YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY PUDDING IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT. WELL, I GUESS I'VE EATEN MY MEAT CAUSE THAT SURE FEELS LIKE PUDDING. IT IS OUR NEW SEGMENT. JON STEWART REWARDS -- [LAUGHING] IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE'RE -- ALRIGHT. SO DON'T JERK AND DRIVE. LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BAD ADVICE. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WITH CLOTH SEATS. BUT IS IT, IS IT THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM AND FOR SOUTH DAKOTA IN PARTICULARLY?
WINTER DRIVING CAN BE TREACHEROUS. SHOULD YOUR TIRE LEAVE A SNOWY OR ICEY ROAD, RESIST THE URGE TO JERK THE STEERING WHEEL.  OVERCORRECTING ONLY RESULTS IN CHAOS, AND BESIDES NOBODY LIKES A JERKER.
Jon: THAT IS, THAT IS SOME EXPLOSION THERE. WAS ONE OF THOSE CARS MADE OF MENTOS AND THE OTHER MADE OF DIET COKE? WHAT? OR IS THAT JUST WHAT GOD DOES TO CARS THAT JERK AND DRIVE? LOOK -- ALRIGHT. THE CAMPAIGN ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
NOW IF YOU THINK THAT'S A BIT FUNNY WITH THE SEXUAL CONNOTATIONS TIED TO IT, THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE ADS SAY THAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION.
Jon: WELL, IT GRABS YOUR ATTENTION BUT YOU DON'T GENERALLY ADDRESS GENUINE PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS WITH SEX PUNS. WE DON'T FIGHT BULLYING WITH A NO FISTING CAMPAIGN.  OR PROMOTE COLON HEALTH WITH LIKE LICK ANAL CANCER. BY THE WAY, THAT'S ALSO AN UNRELEASED ROLLING STONES ALBUM COVER. ACTUALLY THAT MAY BE WHY THIS HAPPENED.
TREVOR JONES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUED THIS STATEMENT "THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SAFETY MESSAGE. I DON'T WANT THIS INNUENDO TO DISTRACT FROM OUR GOAL TO SAVE LIVES ON THE ROAD ."
THE SLOGAN GAINED A LOT OF ATTENTION. BUT NOW THE STATE HAS DECIDED TO PULL IT ANYWAY.
Jon: FOR MORE WE TURN TO AASIF MANDVI LIVE IN SOUTH DAKOTA. AASIF, THANKS FOR JOINING US. WOW, IT'S ALREADY SNOWING OUT THERE. IT'S ALREADY COLD OUT THERE. OBVIOUSLY, AASIF, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH THE MISUNDERSTANDING, SEXUAL INNUENDO.
YES, JON. AND IT IS A SHAME.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE ALL OF THE SILLINESS HAS DISTRACTED FROM THE REAL PROBLEM HERE: THE DANGERS OF MASTURBATING WHILE DRIVING. IT'S KILLING THIS STATE.
Jon: IT'S -- REALLY? IT'S KILLING --
YES, YES.
Jon: REALLY?
YES, YES THIS STATE HAS A PROBLEM WITH DRIVERS WHO CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THEY REACH THEIR DESTINATION TO MASTURBATE.
Jon: WHAT? WHY IS MASTURBATING WHILE DRIVING SO RAMPANT IN SOUTH DAKOTA?
WELL, HAVE YOU SEEN SOUTH DAKOTANS, JON? THEY ARE INSANELY HOT. JANUARY JONES IS FROM HERE. DAISY DUKE IS FROM HERE. AND YOU KNOW HOW CONGRESS PEOPLE ARE THE UGLIEST PEOPLE IN THE STATE? THESE ARE THEIR CONGRESS PEOPLE.
Jon: WOW.
I DARE YOU TO TELL ME THAT YOU ARE NOT HARD AS A ROCK RIGHT NOW, HUH.
Jon: I DON'T DISPUTE THAT. BUT YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE WHEN YOU ARE ALONE IN YOUR CAR.
THERE IS TEMPTATION EVERYWHERE, JON. TAKE SOUTH DAKOTA'S MOST FAMOUS ATTRACTION,  MOUNT RUSHMORE.
Jon: YEAH.
NOW, YOU HAVE SEEN THE HEADS. BUT YOU HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE MONUMENT?
Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT IS UM --
JON, JON, JON, YOU ARE ON THE AIR.
Jon: SORRY. I'M SORRY. JUST WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP SOUTH DAKOTANS?
WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO TRY A NEW CAMPAIGN, NOTHING CLEVER JUST MORE DIRECT. SPEAKING TO SOUTH DAKOTANS IN THE MIDWESTERN COMMON SENSE LANGUAGE THEY'RE USED TO: PLEASE MASTURBATE BEFORE YOU DRIVE. HEY! YOU! GET YOUR HANDS OFF YOUR DICK. AND FINALLY: FOR GOD'S SAKE IF YOU HAVE TO MASTURBATE PULL OVER FIRST.
Jon: GREAT REPORTING, AASIF MANDVI. NOW YOU CAN COME BACK TO NEW YORK.
ABSOLUTELY, JON. BUT FIRST I HAVE TO DO MY PART TO KEEP THE ROAD SAFE.
Jon: WAIT, YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN THE CAR.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT? Jon: ALRIGHT CUTAWAY. AASIF MANDVI.  WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
