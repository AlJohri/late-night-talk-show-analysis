[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. FOOD SHOPPING! FOOD SHOPPING IT'S KIND OF A PAIN IN THE ASS. DID YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE IT MUCH, MUCH WORSE? SAMANTHA BEE HAS MORE.
THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT HAS RAGED FOR DECADES WITH COUNTLESS CASUALTIES ON  BOTH SIDES. BUT PERHAPS THERE'S ONE VICTIM OF THIS WAR THAT MAY BE THE MOST TRAGIC OF ALL, THE PARK SLOPE  FOOD COOP IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.
A FOOD FIGHT AT A LEGAL CO-OP.
THE FOOD BAN IS MEANT TO PUNISH ISRAEL.
THE BATTLE LINES IN COOPERATIVE GROCERY STORE HAVE BEEN DRAWN.
WE WOULD LIKE TO BOYCOTT ISRAELI GOODS. WE BELIEVE THE FOOD WE SELL, EAT AND BUY SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS.
SO PALESTINIANS ARE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FATE THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK DIRECTLY TO  THE PARK SLOPE FOOD CO-OP.
NOT JUST THIS ONE BUT IT HAS A ROLE.
ANOTHER GROUP HAS RISEN UP TO FIGHT THE REMOVAL OF THE THESE  FIVE ISRAELI PRODUCTS FROM THE SHELVES.
WE FORMED A GROUP CALLED MORE HUMOUS PLEASE AND ORGANIZED TO OWE POSE THE BOYCOTT.
SORRY WHAT WAS THE NAME OF YOUR GROUP?
MORE HUMOUS, PLEASE.
IT WASN'T ALREADY TAKE SEASON IN.
WE DIDN'T FIND ANYONE.
IT'S SURPRISING THEY ASKED SO NICELY GIVEN WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
THE SUGGESTION IS TO END ISRAEL AS A JEWISH STATE.
AND THEY ARE DOING YOU THIS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF COUS DRRKS OUS?
RIGHT.
YOU CAN SEE THE TOLL IT'S TAKEN ON THE FACES PUSHING THE  $1,000 STROLLERS ALL OVER THE REGION.
SOMEONE CALLED AND SAID THEY WOULD POISON THE BULK BINS IF IT PASSED.
CO-OP IS NOT A PLACE FOR POLITICS.
POLITICS ARE A PART OF THE CO-OP. THEY JOINED BOYCOTT THE SANCTIONS MOVEMENT AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA.
EVERYBODY BOYCOTTED SOUTH AFTER CHASM ISRAEL IS DIFFERENT. SOUNDS LIKE POLITICS ARE BAD FOR THE CO-OPS WHEN IT'S POLITICS YOU DON'T AGREE WITH.
BEFORE THIS THERE WAS PEACE.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A GROCERY STORE, RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. TO WITNESS THE STRUGGLE FIRSTHAND I TRAVELED TO THIS HOLY PLACE HOME TO SO MANY  DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEVOTED NPR LISTENERS. MAZAR AGREED TO PROVIDE ME WITH SAFE PASSAGE. I'M AN AMERICAN. I'M A JOURNALIST. WE MOVED IN AND THEN DANGER. WHAT IS THAT STRAPPED TO HER CHEST? IT'S JUST A BABY.
IT'S A REAL BABY.
YES, I THINK IT'S A REAL BABY.
IT WAS BECOMING CLEAR WHY THIS PLACE IS SPECIAL WELL. ALL 16,000 MEMBERS REQUIRED TO WORK THREE HOURS A MONTH THEY CREATED A NEW MODEL IN RETAIL EFFICIENCY.
I LIKE TO PAY CASH SO I'M GOING TO A REGISTER.
THIS SAY CHECK OUT REGISTER.
YOU HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER REGISTER.
WE GO TO ANOTHER REGULAR STORE PAY CASH.
DO YOU THEY THAT OTHER STORES HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN ONE STEP. THIS SAY SYSTEM WE DEVELOPED MANY, MANY YEARS AGO.
OF COURSE. THIS IS THE HOLY LAND. YOU CAN'T CHANGE SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE IT'S (bleep). AND WITH YOUR SHOPPING DONE, YOU THINK YOU ARE FREE.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO BOYCOTT ISRAEL, I SUGGEST YOU BOYCOTT CHINA BECAUSE THEY ARE  IN TIBET. I ADVISE YOU BOYCOTT SYRIA BECAUSE THEY ARE IN LEBANON. I BELIEVE THE MOROCCANS IN SOUTH SAHARA. THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT HASN'T BEEN INVADED YET IS ICELAND. MY ARGUMENT IS WHY --
SURE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A TWO SHELF SOLUTION BUT IS IT REALISTIC?
IT WOULDN'T WORK. THE BOYCOTT MEANS WE'LL NOT PARTICIPATE IN ISRAEL'S ECONOMY. WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THE COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT OF PALESTINIANS.
ISRAEL IS PUNISHING ALL PALESTINIANS FOR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW?
YES.
SO YOUR RESPONSE IS TO PUNISH THE CHICKPEA FARMERS BECAUSE OF  THE ACTIONS OF A FEW ISRAELIS.
IT'S NOT AN EQUAL CONFLICT.
I'M A HUMBLE ISRAELI CHICK PEA FARMER HOW MAY I HELP YOU?
APPRECIATE YOUR -- YOU MAY HELP US BUT PRESSURING YOUR GOVERNMENT TO END THE MILITARY  OCCUPATION OF PALESTINIANS.
SO ARE YOU GOING TO BUY MY CHICK PEAS OR --
NOT --
WHAT THE (bleep) DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH ME? THE CO-OP MEETS TONIGHT TO DECIDE THE FATE OF BOYCOTT BUT FOR SOME THIS WAR WOULD NEVER END.
VIOLATE NEW YORK STATE LAW THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE. IF YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE THEN HOW DO YOU
