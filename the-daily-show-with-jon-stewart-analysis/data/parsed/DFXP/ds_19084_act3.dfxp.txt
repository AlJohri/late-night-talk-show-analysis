Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH MICHAEL LEWIS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS GROUP OF EXBANGER AND HEDGE FUND GUYS AND WALL STREET GUYS THAT FORMED THEIR OWN STOCK EXCHANGE BECAUSE THESE HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS WERE RIGGING THE MARKET. WHAT IS THE BANK'S ROLE IN THIS HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING SCAM?
YOU BACK AWAY FROM IT, THE WHOLE THING AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S AN ECOSYSTEM THAT'S BUILT ITSELF AROUND HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS SKIMMING PROFITS. SCALPING PEOPLE IN THE MARKET. THEY PAY THE EXCHANGES FOR SPECIAL ACCESS, SPECIAL INFORMATION THAT ORDINARY INVESTORS DON'T HAVE. THEY PAY THE BROKERS, THE PEOPLE WHO HANDLE STOCK MARKET ORDERS FOR YOUR ORDER. WHEN YOU PLACE AN ORDER YOU PAY A COMMISSION TO TRADE THE STOCK. BUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO GETS SOLD TO A HIGH FREQUENCY TRADER AND THE RIGHT TO TRADE AGAINST YOU GETS SOLD. IT'S CALLED PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW. THAT IN ITSELF. WHY WOULD SOMEONE PAY TO EXECUTE YOUR STOCK MARKET ORDER? YOU WOULD THINK SOMEONE WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION.
Jon: THEY DO BECAUSE THIS TRADER GETS A VOLUME. THEY MAKE MONEY ON VOLUME.
THE HIGH FREQUENCY TRADER GETS A CHANCE TO TRADE AGAINST YOU AT THE OLD PRICE.
Jon: AND YOU DON'T KNOW HE'S THERE. AND YOU'VE NOT INVITED HIM IN.
YOU HAVE NOT INVITED HIM IN. THERE'S DIFFERENT KIND OFS PREDATORY ACTIVITIES THAT THE HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS ARE ENGAGED IN. BUT BASICALLY NONE OF THEM ARE GOOD FOR US. THEY ARE A TAX ON INVESTORS.
Jon: SO HERE NOW WE GET TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS. SO YOU WRITE THIS AND IMMEDIATELY CNBC, FOX NEWS THEY ALL JUMP UP TO DEFEND THIS AS NO THIS HELPS US. THIS IS ADDING LIQUIDITY. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. IT'S ACTUALLY GREAT. EVEN THOUGH TO MY MIND IT COMPLETELY DETERIORATES ANY FAITH YOU WOULD HAVE IN THE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. IT'S NOT AMERICAN AND NOT EVEN CAPITALISM. IT'S CHEATING.
THEY'RE ATTACKING HIM TOO. AND IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE ALL HE REALLY WENT TO DO WAS FIGURE OUT HOW THE STOCK MARKET WORKED. IT WAS A BREATHTAKINGLY COMPLICATED QUESTION. IT BECAME COMPLICATED SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND. ALL HE'S TRYING TO DO IS RECTIFY THAT PROBLEM.
Jon: HE DECONSTRUCTED
AND THE MERE FACT OF DOING IT WAS A RADICAL ACT. THE REASON PEOPLE ARE SO UPSET IS IF YOU BACK AWAY FROM IT SO HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS ARE ESSENTIALLY MAKING MONEY FOR THE WHOLE WALL STREET SYSTEM. THEY ARE PAYING EXCHANGES, THEY'RE PAYING BANKS. SO ANYBODY WHOSE LIVELIHOOD IS DEPENDENT ON WALL STREET PROFITS WHICH PARTLY INCLUDES THE S.E.C. SINCE PEOPLE QUIT THE S.E.C. TO GO WORK FOR WALL STREET IS SORT OF INVESTED IN THIS. I THINK A LOT OF THIS -- IT SOUNDS LIKE A CONSPIRACY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW IT LAYS OUT. THERE'S A CONSPIRACY EXISTS TO KEEP -- BUYERS OF STOCK AWAY FROM SELLERS OF STOCK SO THESE PEOPLE CAN INSERT THEMSELVES ARTIFICIALLY IN BETWEEN. IT WAS LARGELY ACCIDENTAL BUT THEN THE MONEY STARTED GETTING MADE. THE CONSPIRACY IS PREVENTING THE CHANGE.
Jon: THEY FUNCTION ON VOLUME AND VOLATILITY. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. SO IEX COMES IN AND THEY ESTABLISH A PARAMETER FOR TRADING SPEED. THEY GIVE YOU A SET YOU CANNOT JUMP THIS AMOUNT OF TIME.
THEY BECOME FASTER THAN ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE EXCHANGE. THEY SLOW ITS DOWN THE HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS.
Jon: CORRECT. YOU CAN'T BUY LESS THAN A SHARE, RIGHT? THEY'VE SET A STANDARD ON THAT. YOU CAN'T BUY 100th OF A SHARE. SO IF THERE'S A STANDARD FOR SHARE BUYING. WHY ISN'T THERE A STANDARD FOR FREQUENCY OF TRADING THAT IS JUST THE STANDARD SO EVERYBODY IS ON THE SAME FIELD?
THAT WOULD BE IN A SANE WORLD, RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT WOULD YOU DO. YOU WOULD SAY THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT PRICES FASTER, BE ABLE TO TRADE FASTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
Jon: YOU WOULD SET A HIGH SPEED. YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT LIKE YOU HAVE A HALF HOUR. YOU MAKE IT FAST.
THEY MAKE IT REALLY FAST. IT'S IMPERCEPTIBLE. THE SPEEDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE IMPERCEPTIBLE TO HUMANS BEINGS. IT ALL SEEMS INSTANTANEOUS. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO, IN A SANE WORLD THAT'S HOW IT WOULD BE STRUCTURED. WE DON'T LIVE IN THAT WORLD. WE LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD. WHAT IS COOL ABOUT THIS AND WHAT MAKES IT SO NEAT THEY HAVE CREATED THE PLACE WHERE IT'S FAIR. IT'S THE ONE STOCK EXCHANGE THAT'S NOT RUN BY INTERMEDIARIES, NOT RUN BY WALL STREET PEOPLE. IT'S FOR INVESTORS, SO AND THEY FIGURED IT OUT.
Jon: THERE'S NO NEED FOR THESE MIDDLE MEN. THEY ARE UNNECESSARY TO THE SYSTEM THEY DON'T PROVIDE THE LIQUIDITY. THE LIQUIDITY IS PROVIDED BY THE INVESTORS.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. SO NOW WE HAVE A CHOICE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS MODERN STOCK MARKET WE HAVE A CHOICE. WHY ISN'T MY ORDER GOING TO THIS EXCHANGE WHERE I WON'T GET SCALPED? AND THAT'S GOING TO FORCE INVESTORS --
ARE YOU ALLOWED TO GET THAT INFORMATION NOW? IS THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE INVESTOR? ARE THEY ALLOWED TO SAY TELL ME WHO MY ORDER WENT TO.
THEY ARE BEING TOLD NO BUT YES. IEX ACTUALLY SET UP A WEB SITE CALLED I AM AN INVESTOR.ORG WHERE YOU CAN LEARN YOUR RIGHTS AS AN INVESTOR. YOU CAN DEMAND THAT YOUR ORDER BE HANDLED IN A CERTAIN WAY.
Jon: I'M GOING TO GO ON THAT SITE. IS THERE ALSO PORN? I LIKE A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA WHEN I GO ON A SITE. CAN I WIN AN XBOX IF I CLICK ON SOMETHING. WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK. YOU'RE STAYING WITH ME AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE WEB BECAUSE I DO WANT TO ASK THESE FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORKS THAT ARE COMPLICIT IN THIS IS DRIVING ME INSANE. FLASH BOYS IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. IT'S ABOUT AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE AND INTERESTING TOPIC BUT IT'S SO WELL WRITTEN, BEAUTIFUL NARRATIVE. MICHAEL LEWIS. YOU GOTTA GET THIS. TREMENDOUS. THANK YOU.
