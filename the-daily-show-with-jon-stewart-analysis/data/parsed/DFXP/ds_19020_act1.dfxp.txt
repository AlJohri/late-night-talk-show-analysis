FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY MAN TONIGHT PATRICK STEWART IS GOING TO BE HERE. HE'S A GOOD MAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ONE OF OUR FAVORITES, PATRICK STEWART. AS YOU KNOW, ALL WEEK WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD AS HE'S BEEN FILMING -- [LAUGHTER] -- FILMING THE FOOTAGE FOR WHAT WE ASSUME WILL BE HIS FORTHCOMING VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC EPISODE. HE WAS RIDING HIGH AS MAYOR OF TORONTO BUT HOW HIGH NO ONE HAD ANY IDEA. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, FOR QUITE SOME TIME ROB FORD WAS DENYING HE WAS A SMOKER OF CRACK COCAINE HE RECENTLY AMENDED THAT STATEMENT SLIGHTLY ON TUESDAY.
YES, I HAVE SMOKED CRACK COCAINE.
Jon: OH, CRACK COCAINE, I THOUGHT YOU HAD ASKED HAD YOU TRIED JACK LALAINE, OR HIJACKED A PLANE OR IF THERE ARE ANY BLACKS IN MAINE. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. MY HEARING IS NOT GOOD WITH WHAT ALL THE CRACK SMOKING. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I AM SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO LOVE ROB FORD HAVE TRIED TO MAKE ROB FORD GO TO REHAB TO WHICH HE HAS REPLIED AGAIN, AND THIS IS, AGAIN, OF COURSE, SPECULATION, NO, NO, NO,. [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE HAS SEEMINGLY AS MAYOR SURVIVED HIS CRACK SMOKING ADMISSION. WHAT IS GOING TO TEST HIS ABILITY TO STAY IN PUBLIC OFFICE TODAY?
A BRAND NEW VIDEO OF CRACK SMOKING MAYOR OF TORONTO ROB FORD.
(bleep) HE DIES OR I DIE. (bleep) I'LL RIP HIS THROAT OUT HIS EYES OUT (bleep) (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL -- [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS SAYING BUT IT CLEARLY LOOKS LIKE OUTTAKES FROM "TOMMY BOY." THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING. [LAUGHTER] TERRIBLE CAMERA WORK, BY THE WAY. HAS IT OCCURRED TO MAYOR ROB FORD THAT ALL THESE VIDEOS OF HIM SMOKING CRACK AND ACTING CRAZY ARE AN INDICATION THAT EVEN HIS FRIENDS ARE GOING, NO ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE THIS (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] AND HE IS SO LIKE -- IT'S CLEAR TO ME NOW THAT HE SMOKES CRACK TO CALM HIMSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT BE A -- I DON'T WANT TO STICK MY (bleep).
Jon: BY THE WAY POLITIFACT RATED THAT LAST STATEMENT FROM THE MAYOR TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE NFL IS FULL OF MYSTERIES LIKE WHY DO THE PLAYERS KEEP GETTING CONCUSSIONS AND WHAT IS UP WITH ALL THE CONCUSSIONS AND WHY DO THEY KEEP DEVELOPING BRAIN DAMAGE LATER IN LIFE? I GUESS SOME MYSTERIES AREN'T MEANT TO HE BE SOLVED BUT LAST WEEK THE CURTAIN WAS PULLED BACK ON THE MIAMI DOLPHINS LOCKER ROOM EXPOSING THE UNDERBELLY OF ROOMROOKIE HAZING. THE MIAMI OF DOLPHINS SUSPENDED RICHIE INCOGNITO AFTER ALLEGATIONS HE MAY HAVE BULLIED JONATHAN MARTIN SO BADLY HE LEFT THE TEAM.
Jon: FIRST THINGS FIRST, RICHIE INCOGNITO, COME ON. THAT'S A NAME AN UNDERCOVER COP COMES UP WITH ON THE FLY ONE OF THOSE POLICE ACADEMY MOVIES, ME? NO I'M RICHIE INCOGNITO. SECOND OF ALL THAT'S A TERRIBLE ALLEGATION. I IMAGINE THE BACKLASH IS FIERCE.
JONATHAN MARTIN IS A SIX FOUR 320 POUND MAN. AT SOME POINT IN TIME YOU HAVE TO STAND YOUR GROUND.
IF HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THAT GUY WAS TREATING HIM HE HAD A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT.
THAT'S THINGS FOOTBALL TEAMS DO.
AT THIS LEVEL YOU ARE A MAN. YOU ARE NOT A LITTLE BOY.
Jon: SORRY, WHEN I SAY BACKLASH I MUST HAVE MEANT THE ONE AGAINST JONATHAN MARTIN. APPARENTLY THIS DICK INCOGNITO WAS JUST FUNNING. WHAT DID HE DO THE OLD WHIPPED CREAM ON THE HAND. THE OLD JOCK STRAP ITCHING POWDER.
INCOGNITO HARASSED MARTIN WITH A STRING OF RACIST TEXTS.
WHAT IS UP YOU (bleep) BLANK. I WANT TO BLANK IN YOUR BLANKING MOUTH.
YOU ARE STILL A ROOKIE. I'LL KILL YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT DOES SEEM PRETTY ROUGH UNLESS OF COURSE HE REALLY WAS JUST SAYING BLANK. THEN IT'S REALLY JUST A LARGE MAN SHOUTING MAD LIBS AT YOU. I'LL BLANK IN YOUR -- I NEED AN ADJECTIVE. I GUESS THAT'S NOT -- HE WAS SAYING HE WANTED TO (bleep) IN HIS MOUTH? THAT IS BAD. A LITTLE NAME CALLING AND SOME DEATH THREATS, IT'S ALL GOOD.
RICHIE INCOGNITO PRESSURED MARTIN TO PAYING $15,000 FOR A TRIP TO LAS VEGAS FOR A TRIP MARTIN WASN'T EVEN ON.
Jon: THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMEONE TO (bleep) IN YOUR MOUTH IN LAS VEGAS IT COSTS WAY MORE THAN $15,000 ALTHOUGH IN THE LAS VEGAS TRADITION IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT. [LAUGHTER] YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT! WALK AWAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'VE CLEARLY CROSSED THE LINE WITH YOU PEOPLE. SO LET'S JUST GET OUR BEARINGS HERE. THIS INCOGNITO DUDE SOUNDS LIKE AN (bleep). HOW DO THEY DEFEND THIS?
IF YOU'VE BEEN IN AN NFL LOCKER ROOM IT'S A CULTURE UNLIKE ANY OTHER.
IT'S A CULTURE THAT EXISTS IN FOOTBALL.
IT'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY WE FUNCTION AND DO THINGS.
Jon: OH, BY ALL MEANS CARRY ON. CARRY ON WITH YOUR DEATH THREATS AND RACIAL SLURS, I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOUR CULTURE. OHH. I WILL (bleep) IN YOUR MOUTH! LOOK. UNLESS THE MIAMI DOLPHINS LOCKER ROOM IS 30 MILES OFF SHORE IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS YOU ARE STILL SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES LAW AND WORKPLACE REGULATION. JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE COOL WITH FOOTBALL CULTURE DOESN'T MEAN EVERYBODY IS. FOR INSTANCE, MANY SAY HE IS A GREAT GUY, LOTS OF FUN. LIFE OF PARTY. CHECK THIS OUT.
(bleep) (bleep) (bleep) MOTHER (bleep). [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SEE! JUST A SIMPLE FUN FOOTBALL GUY DOING SOME SORT OF SOUTH FLORIDA MATING DANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] OR MAYBE HE IS RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF TORONTO. I DON'T KNOW BUT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE THING, IT MAY BE -- WHAT IS THAT? HOW IS THAT NOT HELD UP BY TWO BY FOURS. HERE IS THE THING. IT MAY BE SUPER FUN FOR FOOTBALL CULTURE AND SUPER FUN FOR YOU GUYS TO GO TO A BAR AND SEE YOUR SEA COW OF A TEAMMATE GO LOU FERRIGNO, BUT FOR NON BEHEMOTHS LIKE THIS GUY IN THE BACKGROUND JUST TRYING NOT TO MAKE EYE CONTACT AND GET THE (bleep) AWAY FROM HIM THIS, BEHAVIOR IS TERRIFYING WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU FIND IT SO FUNNY. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A LESS APT NAME FOR A PERSON THAN INCOGNITO. I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TELL WHERE THE LOCKER ROOM CULTURE ENDS AND THE WORLD BEGINS BUT HERE AT TDS WE'RE HERE TO HELP WITH A BRAND NEW SEGMENT.
HI THERE, WE'RE JOHN OLIVER, JASON JONES AND AL MADRIGAL.

WE KNOW BEING PART OF ANY TEAM ISN'T EASY.

SO SIMPLE EVEN A CHURRO GOBBLING MEXICAN LIKE AL CAN UNDERSTAND.

ANYWHERE, JASON. FORGET THAT. THE POINT IS DON'T EXTORT MONEY FROM YOUR COWORKERS. I KNOW IT'S A LOT TO REMEMBER BUT FOLLOW THE SIMPLE LIST OF DO'S AND DON'T'S AND YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY TO A HAPPY WORK PLACE IN NO TIME.
