NOW OBVIOUSLY THE DEBATES ARE  UTTERLY OVERABLE ID BY THE  MEDIA. EACH NETWORK SPENDING COUNTLESS  POST-DEBATE HOURS WITH PUNDITS  AND BODY LANGUAGE EXPERTS AND  SCIENTISTS USING WHATEVER THE HELL THAT IS ON THAT GUY'S FACE. IT MADE US THINK HERE AT "THE  DAILY SHOW," WHY CAN'T WE GET IN  ON SOME OF THAT SWEET, SWEET  ACTION? JOHN OLIVER JOINS US. JOHN? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HI, JON. LAST NIGHT I ASSEMBLED MY OWN  PANEL OF EXPERTS THE WATCH THE  DEBATE, A BODY LANGUAGE ANALYST,  A PAGEANT JUDGE, AN EXPERT ON AURAS, A MAN WHO WORKS AT A TIE  STORE, A YENTA, A WOMAN WHO  DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH, SOMEONE  WHO RECENTLY HAD KNEE SURGERY AND AN EASILY BORED TEENAGE  GIRL.
Jon: THAT SEEMS LIKE A  RIDICULOUS GROUP OF PEOPLE TO  PUT TOGETHER TO ANALYZE THE  DEBATE.
THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS, JON,  SO TO GIVE THEIR EXPERT  ANALYSIS, I GIVE TO OWE THE JOHN  OLIVER FOCUS GROUP. I'M HERE WITH A DIVERSE PANEL OF  EXPERTS TO GAUGE IN REAL-TIME  THEIR REACTIONS TO THIS DEBATE. LET THE DEBATE COMMENCE.
WELCOME. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND  GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY.
OKAY. SO LET'S STOP IT RIGHT THERE. WHO DO WE THINK IS WINNING SO  FAR?
OBAMA.
OBAMA.
PAGEANT JUDGE?
RIGHT AWAY OBAMA CAME UP WITH  A HI, HELLO, THE HAND UP HIGH  WITH A BIG SMILE.
AURA EXPERT?
JUST YOU COULD FEEL FROM HIS  VARIOUS BODY LANGUAGE.
SO FAR IT'S EQUAL.
THEY BOTH WALKED ON TO THE  MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND SHOOK  HANDS AND LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED SO FARR.
EXACTLY.
THAT'S FASCINATING. BUT KEY DEBATE ANALYSIS IS MUCH  DEEPER THAN HOW YOU WALK INTO A  ROOM. MAN WHO WORKS AT TIE STORE, WHO  DO YOU THINK IS WINNING SO FAR?
GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS A TIE  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WITH A  STRIPE. IT'S ACTUALLY AN ENGLISH STRIPE  AS OPPOSED TO AN AMERICAN  STRIPE. IT SEEMS TO ME SOMEONE RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN  ADVISED TO WEAR AN AMERICAN  STRIPED TIE.
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.
PAGEANT JUDGE, YOU AGREE WITH  THAT?
I AGREE. FOR THE OVERALL PACKAGE, YOU'RE  REPRESENTING AMERICA. MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE THAT  KNOWLEDGE, BUT NOW THAT I DO  HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE, IT JUST  MADE ME FEEL LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
EVEN THOUGH YOU LITERALLY  LEARNED THAT FACT 30 SECONDS  AGO?
ABSLIGHTLY. IT DID BOTHER ME.
AS THE DEBATE PROGRESSED, THE  ANALYSIS BECAME EVEN MORE  SOPHISTICATED. NO NEITHER MAN SO FAR HAVE PUT  THEIR HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS. APART FROM NOTHING, WHAT DOES  THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS THEY'RE MORE OPEN. THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. THEY'RE LETTING IT ALL OUT.
LADY WHO DOESN'T SPEAK  ENGLISH, TELL ME IN YOUR OWN  WORDS WHO IS WINNING THIS  DEBATE. FOUL
[INAUDIBLE]
LOUDER: TELL ME  IN YOUR OWN WORDS WHO IS WINNING  THIS DEBATE?
SAY AGAIN PLEASE.
MAN WHO RECENTLY HAD SURGERY,  BOTH HAVE THEIR KNEES UP. AS SOMEONE WHO SUFFERED AN ACL  INJURY, WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU  FEEL?
THAT JUST REMINDS ME OF WHAT  I CAN'T DO.
BUT AS ALL THE EXPERTS ASSURE  US, THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY TELL  WHO WINS THE DEBATE IS TO WATCH IT WITHOUT AUDIO. NOW, WITHOUT THE SOUND, WHO DO  WE THINK IS WINNING?
BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT?
ROMNEY. ROMNEY?
YES. HE'S MORE OPEN. HE'S MORE FLUID IN HIS GESTURES. HE'S LESS ANGRIMENT
EASILY BORED TEENAGE GIRL,  ANYTHING?
I DON'T KNOW. [LAUGHTER]
SEE IF THIS AFFECTS YOUR  RESPONSE. FOR THIS NEXT SEGMENT WE'LL KEEP  THE PICTURE UP BUT WE'LL PLAY  THE AUDIO FROM AN EPISODE OF  "CSI: MIAMI."
LIKE 2,000 CASES.
2,000 CASES AND NOW 2,000  SUSPECTS. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
DID THAT AFFECT YOUR  ENJOYMENT OF THIS DEBATE?
MADE IT MORE ENJOYABLE.
YEAH.
YES.
IT'S FUN.
IT ACTUALLY DID.
THAT IS HYPOTHETICALLY  FASCINATING. THIS WAS GOING GREAT, BUT THERE  WAS ONLY ONE WAY THE MAKE SURE. HI. SO YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE  PANEL, WATCHING THIS DEBATE. BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT, WHAT IS  YOUR REACTION TO HOW THE OTHER  BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT IS DOING?
I LIKE THE FACT THAT SHE'S  PHYSICALLY... HER FACE  EXPRESSING THAT SHE'S NOT  AGREEING WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MAN WHO  WORKS AT THE TIE STORE. EDUCATED LADY, HOW IS WHAT HE'S  WEARING AFFECTING WHAT HE'S  SAYING ABOUT WHAT ROMNEY IS  WEARING?
I WOULD SAY THAT IT DOESN'T  SIGNIFY THE BEST TASTE REALLY  FOR OCTOBER TO BE WEARING LIME  GREEN.
THE LADY WHO DOESN'T SPEAK  ENGLISH, SHE'S NOT SAID MUCH. IS THAT POLITE OR IMPOLITE?
WELL, YOU SEE, IT'S ALMOST  LIKE SHE'S A NON-PERSON TO ME  BECAUSE SHE'S SO QUIET.
DO YOU THINK THAT HAS HIGH  NO-TO-DO WITH THE FACT THAT SHE  CAN'T SPEAK A CONSIDERED OF  ENGLISH?
POSSIBLY. SHE COULD AT LEAST SMILE.
RIGHT.
BUT OF COURSE IN THE END  THERE'S ONLY ONE PANEL THAT  REALLY MATTERS. SO OHIO VOTER, WHO DO YOU THINK  WON TONIGHT'S DEBATE?
I THOUGHT OBAMA WON.
OBAMA IT IS THEN BECAUSE YOU  ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO COUNTS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.
