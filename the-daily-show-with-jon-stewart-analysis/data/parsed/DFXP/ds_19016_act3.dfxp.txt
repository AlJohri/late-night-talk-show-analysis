[ APPLAUSE ] MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER FOR ESPN, HIS NEW BOOK HE COWROTE WITH HIS BROTHER IS CALLED "LEAGUE OF DENIAL", TH NFL CONCUSSIONS AND THE BATTLE FOR TRUTH, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARK FAINARU-WADA. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: I KNEW IT. HOW ARE YOU, MARK, NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Stewart: THE BOOK IS CALLED "LEAGUE OF DENIAL", THE GENERAL SORT OF SYNOPSIS, APPARENTLY 250-POUND, IN SHAPE MEN SMASHING THEIR HEADS INTO EACH OTHER REPEATEDLY CAUSES PERMANENT DAMAGE AND THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE SAID TO THEM, UH, NO, NO, IT'S COOL. I MEAN.
THAT IS REALLY THE MESSAGE, I THINK STEVE AND I AS WE DID THE REPORTING ON THE BOOK I THINK WHAT STRUCK US WAS THE PROFOUND LEVEL OF THAT DENIAL. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO DECADES OF DENIAL, SORT OF TRAJECTORY OF ON THE ONE HAND, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ATTACKING INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS THE SCIENTISTS WHO THINK THEY WILL HELP THE NFL AND SAY LOOK YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM THAT BRAIN DAMAGE CAN BE CAUSED BY PLAYING IN THE NFL INSTEAD OF EMBRACING THOSE GUYS, THE NFL IS MOCKING THEM, ATTACKING THEM AND TRYING TO DENY THEIR VERY EXISTENCE IN SOME WAYS AND CREATE THEIR OWN RESEARCH ARM AND THAT RESEARCH ARM BASICALLY PUTS OUT PAPER AFTER PAPER AND A JOURNAL COOPTED BY THE LEAGUE ITSELF.
Stewart: RIGHT.
AND THE PAPERS SAY, NFL PLAYERS ARE FINE, LIKE CONCUSSIONS ARE NOT A BIG ISSUE, WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS AND YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE COOL.
Stewart: MEANWHILE, PLAYERS CONTINUE TO SUFFER TERRIBLE EFFECTS OF THESE CONCUSSIONS, AND AFTER PASSING AWAY, AT MUCH EARLIER AGES WHEN THEY DO THE AUTOPSY, THEY FIND THIS CTE.
RIGHT, CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, THIS TERRIBLE BRAIN DISEASE CAUSED BY PLAYING THE GAME. RIGHT.
I MEAN THERE ARE SEVERAL STORIES IN THE BOOK ABOUT, ONE GUY FOR EXAMPLE, DAVE DUORSON WHO PLAYED FOR YEARS FOR THE CHICAGO BEARS, ONE OF THE GREATEST PLAYERS, REALLY HARD HITTER AND DUORSON WAS ONE OF THE DENIERS AND SPENT YEARS SAYING THIS WAS NOT AN ISSUE AND BEFORE CONGRESS TALKING ABOUT IT WASN'T AN ISSUE BUT  HIS LIFE, IT JUST FALLS APART AT THE END, HE REALLY STARTS TO LOSE IT AND EVENTUALLY THERE IS A DRAMATIC SCENE IN THE BOOK, SORT OF MACABRE BEFORE HE SHOOTS HIMSELF IN THE CHEST HE SORT OF PAYS HOMAGE TO CONCUSSIONS, HE LAYS OUT A MAGAZINE, A SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ABOUT CONCUSSIONS, HE LAYS OUT DISABILITY FILES ABOUT CONCUSSIONS AND SHOOTS HIMSELF AND SAYS PLEASE STUDY MY BRAIN, CLEARLY THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THAT, I WANT THE NFL TO LOOK AT IT AND WHEN THEY DO THEY FIND INDEED HE HAS THIS DISEASE, CTE.
Stewart: THE OTHER SIDE OF, YOU KNOW, NOW YOU KNOW THIS, IT IS NOT LIKE KNOWING THIS STOPS IT. I LOVE WATCHING FOOTBALL AND THESE ARE GROWN MEN MAKING CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW, LORD KNOWS THAT IN TERMS OF ATHLETICS, LIKE BOXING THEY KNOW BOXING CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE AND INSTEAD OF STOPPING BOXING, WE AS AMERICANS DECIDE WHAT IF WE DID IT WITHOUT GLOVES AND YOU COULD USE YOUR KNEES AND ELBOWS.
YES. AGAIN, WHAT, WHAT IF WE WENT FOR THE CONCUSSIONS QUICKER, HOW ABOUT THAT?
Stewart: I THINK STEVE AND I HAVE HUGE FOOTBALL FANS, WE ARE SEASON TICKET HOLDERS WE LOVE THE SPORT AND THE GAME AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT IS ABOUT INFORMED DECISION AND THAT WAS LARGELY, I MEAN, WE WENT TO DO THE BOOK IT WAS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK WHAT DID THE NFL KNOW AND WHEN DID THEY KNOW IT?  AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS TO INFORM PEOPLE BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION IS HAPPENING, I MEAN YOU HAVE PLAYERS WHO ARE REALLY PISSED OFF AND UPSET FOR TWO DECADES  THE LEAGUE WAS BASICALLY TELLING THEM LOOK YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO BE FINE IF YOU PLAY FOOTBALL AND THEN, BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE AT THE LOWER LEVELS NOW, AND THE NFL MESSAGE TRICKLES DOWN AND WHERE THE DISCUSSION IS REALLY HAPPENING NOW AND IT IS SORT OF INTERESTING YOU HAVE PARENTS TALKING TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT DO YOU WANT TO PLAY.
Stewart: RIGHT.
AND I THINK THAT DISCUSSION IS DIFFERENT THAN THE NFL DISCUSSION. I DON'T WANT THE LEAGUE TO CHANGE, I LOVE IT, IT'S A BRUTAL, VIOLENT SPORT AND I LOVE IT.
Stewart: DOES THIS ALL GO AWAY IF THE LEAGUE, JUST THE ONE CHANGE THEY MAKE IS WHEN YOU ARE SIGNED TO A PROFESSIONAL TEAM THEY HAND YOU A PIECE OF PAPER AND SAY, JUST SIGN THAT REAL QUICK?
A RELEASE.
Stewart: YOU MAY END UP WITH A BRAIN THAT IS LIKE OATMEAL, HERE, SIGN THIS.
WELL, I THINK NOW THAT ISSUE IS SORT OF DONE FOR THEM, RIGHT?
Stewart: RIGHT.
BECAUSE NOW THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE, EITHER FROM US OR OTHERS IT IS AN INFORMED DECISION AND THEY CAN'T ARGUE ANYMORE, BUT FOR TWO DECADES YOU HAD PLAYERS WHO ARE NOW SAYING LOOK, YOU GUYS MISLED US AND I THINK.
Stewart: THAT IS REALLY THE ISSUE.
THAT IS THE ISSUE AND ALSO THAT ISSUE TRICKLES DOWN BECAUSE AGAIN THE LEAGUE'S MESSAGE WAS ALWAYS ABOUT VIOLENCE FOR YEARS IF YOU WATCHED AND SPENT TIME ON THIS, THE NFL MESSAGE ABOUT VIOLENCE, EVERYTHING WAS ALL ABOUT THE VIOLENCE OF THE SPORT AND NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEAGUE IT IS MARKETING SAFETY, IT IS ALL ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THEY BRING MOMMY BLOGGERS TO NEW YORK, SECTION ON THIS, MOMMY BLOGGERS THAT COME TO NEW YORK AND THEY ARE EDUCATING THEM ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE SPORT AND IT IS ALL ABOUT THAT MESSAGE TO YOUNGER PLAYERS.
Stewart: EVERYTHING WITH THE NFL NOW SEEMS TO BE, GUYS, TO THE PLAYERS, KEEP THE VIOLENCE OFF THE FIELD, PLEASE, JUST DO IT IN YOUR PERSONAL LIVES. TAKE IT  OUT ON THE ONES YOU LOVE.
WELL -- I MEAN, CLEARLY THE MESSAGE IS, THIS IS -- WE NEED THE FIND A WAY TO BE SAFE.
Stewart: RIGHT.
BUT THAT CONCEPT IS RIDICULOUS AT THE NFL LEVEL.
Stewart: THAT IS SORT OF THE POINT IS WHAT DO YOU DO AT SOME LEVEL?  AND FIVE MINUTES, STICK AROUND. "LEAGUE OF DENIAL", ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW, IT IS LIKE A MYSTERY NOVEL AND HAVE THEY READ THIS HANDLE CONTACTED YOU AT THE NFL?
WE HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD FROM THEM.
Stewart: THAT IS NOT GOOD.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS BOOK. MARK FAINARU-WADA, WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE.
