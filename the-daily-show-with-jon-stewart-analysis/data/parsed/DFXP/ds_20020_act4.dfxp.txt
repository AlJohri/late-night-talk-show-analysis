Jon:  THAT'S OUR SHOW. LISTEN UP. SO, I'VE KNOWN AASIF MANDVI FOR MANY YEARS. YOU KNOW HE'S A CORRESPONDENT ON THE PROGRAM. SO RECENTLY I FIND OUT, HE CAN READ. ALSO, HE CAN WRITE. HE WROTE A BOOK. WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE THAT HE WROTE WHILE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING FOR ME. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW, OBVIOUSLY HE CAN'T READ OR WRITE SO WELL. IT'S CALLED "NO LAND'S MAN." I MEAN HE COMPLETELY ( BLEEP ) UP THE TITLE. BECAUSE THE PHRASE IS NO-MAN'S-LAND. BUT HE WROTE "NO LAND'S MAN" WHICH-- OH. AND HE'S CLEVER. YOU SHOULD GET IT. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
DALLAS IS IN LONDON FOR THEIR BIG GAME ON SUNDAY AGAINST JACKSONVILLE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY USED A BAD SOCIAL MEDIA HASHTAG. HASHTAG COWBOYSUK, CAN ALSO READ, "COWBOYS, SUCK."
