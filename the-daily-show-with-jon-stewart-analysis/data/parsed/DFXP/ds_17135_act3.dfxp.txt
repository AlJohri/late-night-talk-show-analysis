MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER AT LIZ CLAIBORNE. HE'S TALINGS CO-HOST OF LIFETIME TV'S "PROJECT RUNWAY" NOW IN ITS TENTH SEASON.
MY CUSTOMER IS A MOM ON THE GO.
CAN I BE BLUNT? IT LOOKS SAD.
I'M DOING A PAIR OF LONG SHORTS AND A WOVEN TOP.
WATCH THE PROPORTION. YOU WANT THERE TO BE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO.
OKAY.
I'M MAKING A HOODIE OUT OF A HEAVIER KNIT. WE HAVE A LONG-SLEEVE TEE, ANOTHER TANK THAT'S GOING UNDERNEATH WITH THE LONG LEGGINGS.
SO LOTS OF LAYERING.
LOTS OF LAYERING.
ALL RIGHT. GO BACK TO SEWING SO YOU'LL HAVE THINGS TO PUT ON YOUR MODEL WHEN SHE COMES IN FOR A FITTING.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM TIM GUNN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] MY MAN. [CHEERING ANDHOW ARE YOU?
I'M ALWAYS BETTER FOR HAVING BEEN WITH YOU?
Jon: HOW IS THE SHOW GOING? IT'S THE TENTH YEAR
IT'S ACTUALLY YEAR EIGHT. WE PREMIERED IN 2004.
Jon: THEN YOU DOUBLED DOWN ON A COUPLE SEASONS.
A COUPLE.
Jon: WHAT DO THEY DO WITH EVERYTHING THEY MAKE? DO YOU KEEP IT? IS THERE A LOST AND FOUND?
WE AUCTION IT OFF.
Jon: REALLY?
YES, PEOPLE AT HOME CAN ACTUALLY OWN IT. I ACTUALLY AM GLAD THAT I'M NOT AT THEIR HOMES WHEN IT ARRIVES BECAUSE WE REALLY DO HAVE A DAY  FOR MOST OF THESE CHALLENGES. THEY'RE NOT PRETTY ON THE INSIDE. ON THE OUTSIDE THEY MAY BE, BUT NOT ON THE INSIDE.
Jon: TO USE A WORD "SAD." NOW, DO YOU WATCH? BECAUSE "PROJECT RUNWAY" WAS ONE OF FIRST REALITY SHOWS WHERE PEOPLE HAD A DEMONSTRABLE ABILITY. THEY HAD A REAL SKILL. YOU WOULD PUT THEM UNDER THIS CRUCIBLE OF PRESSURE. THAT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN OFF NOW, BUT YOU GUYS WERE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO DO THAT.
THANK YOU. WHEN THE PRODUCERS FIRST CONTACTED ME BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A CONSULTANT. THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A CONSULTANT. THEY WERE DOING A REALITY SHOW ABOUT FASHION. I SAID, A REALITY SHOW ABOUT FASHION. THIS INDUSTRY HAS ENOUGH TROUBLE WITHOUT THAT. I FIGURED I'D TAKE SOMEONE OFF THE STREET AT RANDOM AND YOU'RE  GOING TO MAKE SOME CLOTHES. BUT WHEN I HEARD THEY WANTED TO USE REAL FASHION DESIGNERS, I THOUGHT THIS SHOW WILL HAVE A  SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE, IT WILL HAVE INTEGRITY AND INDEED IT DOES.
HOW DO THEY HOLD UP NOW THAT THEY'VE GONE, THE TENTH SEASON, I ASSUME THAT THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE GETTING CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. HOW DO THEY... DO THEY STILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE OF THE SHOW? DO SOME OF THE PEOPLE LEAVE THIS?
YES.
WHAT, I HAVE A DAY? I'M LEAVING.
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE TO ME, JON. I SAY, HAVE YOU WATCHED THE SHOW? THEIR RESPONSE, IS WELL, WE THOUGHT YOU FAKED IT. WE THOUGHT THAT, IN FACT...
Jon: LIKE PRO WRESTLING?
OH, WE REALLY HAVE A WEEK FOR THESE CHALLENGES. NO, YOU HAVE A DAY. YOU HAVE THE CHALLENGE THIS MORNING. YOU'RE SHOWING IT ON A RUNWAY THERE N FRONT OF HEIDI KLUM TOMORROW.
JON: DIDN'T YOU FAKE HEIDI KLUM?
HEIDI IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FAKE. SHE'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FAKE. SHE'S BREATHTAKING, ISN'T SHE?
A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
I'M A VERY LUCKY GUY, JON.
Jon: I WOULD PUT HER ON A MAGAZINE. [LAUGHTER]
I'LL SHARE THAT IDEA WITH HER.
Jon: DID YOU WATCH... ARE THERE OTHER REALITY-TYPE THINGS? DO YOU WATCH COOKING SHOWS?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE REALITY COOKING SHOWS I FIND INTERESTING ALSO, THOUGH AS  EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS, YOU CAN'T TASTE IT, YOU CAN'T SMELL IT. YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE THE JUDGES. IN THE CASE OF PROJECT RUNWAY, EVERYONE AT HOME CAN BE A JUDGE AND I ASSUME THEY ARE.
Jon: I AM FIERCE. I DO A LOT OF THIS, YOU WILL NOT PUT THAT OUT THERE. NO. NO, NO, NO. I GET VERY INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE THING. THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE GRADUATED, I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY DO THIS NOW ON THESE OTHER SHOWS, "AMERICAN  IDOL." THEY BRING BACK THE WINNERS OF YEARS PAST, AND SOME OF THEM  HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS CAREERS AND THEN OTHERS ARE NOW LIVING IN A BOX. SO WHAT... WHAT HAS BEEN... HAS THE SUCCESS OF THE SHOW TRANSLATED TO PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS?
MY RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION, AND I RECEIVE IT WITH SOME FREQUENCY IS THE DESIGNERS CAN ONLY WITH AS SUCCESSFUL AS THEIR  RESOURCES AND THEIR AMBITIONS ALLOW THEM TO BE.
RIGHT.
AND WE'VE HAD ANY NUMBER OF DESIGNERS WHO HAVE COME FROM  PLACES OTHER THAN NEW YORK OR LOS ANGELES. THEY WANTED TO STAY HOME. I'M THINKING ABOUT CHLOE DOW, THE WINNER OF SEASON TWO, SHE STAYED IN HOUSTON. SHE TRIPLED HER BUSINESS. SHE'S ON QVC REGULARLY. SHE'S PAYING THE BILLS. AND SHE'S REALLY VERY, VERY HAPPY. THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THE SEASON FOUR WINNER, CHRISTIAN SIRIANO WHO HAS BECOME  PRACTICALLY A HOUSEHOLD NAME. HE'S A BIG BRAND NOW.
Jon: AND OTHERS GET A JOB WORKING FOR ANOTHER DESIGNER, AND THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL, AND NO SHAME IN THAT.
NO SHAME AT ALL. ALSO LOOK AT THIS ECONOMY. IT'S A REALLY TOUGH TIME TO BE A FLEDGLING FASHION DESIGNER. IT'S A TOUGH TIME.
Jon: IT'S A TOUGH TIME REALLY TO BE ANYTHING.
ANYTHING, I AGREE WITH YOU. I AGREE.
OTHER THAN WHAT I ACTUALLY DO THIS SHOW AND I RUN A HEDGE FUND. I'M DOING QUITE WELL. WELL, PROJECT RUNWAY AIRS ON THURSDAYS AT 9:00 P.M. ON LIFETIME SEASON 10. DON'T GIVE ANYTHING AWAY.
I WON'T.
Jon: HEIDI KLUM GETS EATEN BY A BEAR.
HEIDI COULD EVEN SEDUCE A WILD BEAR.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? NICE OF YOU TO CALL ME THAT. [LAUGHTER] TIM GUNN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
