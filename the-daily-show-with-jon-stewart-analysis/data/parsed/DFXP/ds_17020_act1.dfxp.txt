NOVEMBER 10th, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BARN BURNER TONIGHT, OUR GUEST ADAM SANDLER, SANDLER'S GOING TO BE JOINING US LATER. SANDLER THE STAR OF MY THREE FAVORITE MOVIE, BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILLMORE AND, UH--  (APPLAUSE) OH, WHAT IS THE THIRD? THE-- UH--  (LAUGHTER) EPA, I DON'T-- I DON'T-- OH, THAT REMINDED ME! LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST NIGHT'S GOP DEBATE ON CNBC, THE 9th OF THE PRIMARY SEASON. NOW BEFORE WE GET INTO RICK PERRY'S NOW INFAMOUS ABC WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS AGONY  OF DEFEAT-WORTHY BRAIN TURD, AND BELIEVE ME WE WILL GET THERE, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO START WAY BRIEF ANNOUNCE. I'M CALLING THE FIGHT, THROW IN THE TOWEL, IT'S OVER. REPUBLICANS, YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE. YOU DIDN'T WANT ROMNEY, TOO BAD. ARE YOU NOW STUCK WITH MITT ROMNEY [BLEEP] ROMNEY, DONE. HE IS THE WINNER. ROMNEY WINS. WE'RE CALLING IT TONIGHT. (APPLAUSE) IT'S OVER. INDECISION 2012 MERCY RULE EDITION BECAUSE IN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES AS IN  LITTLE LEAGUE IF ONE TEAM IS UP 10-0 IN THE THIRD YOU CALL IT A DAY AND YOU HEAD  OVER TO FRIENDLY'S FOR SOME FRIBBLES AND SOME FOOD POISONING. LART. (LAUGHTER) HOW BAD IS IT AT THIS POINT? IN OUR COVERAGE OF THE ROMNEY'S CLINCHING DEBATE, WE NEED NOT EVEN SHOW YOU HIGHLIGHTS OF ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER) BUT MERELY THE SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION OF HIS OPPONENTS. FOR INSTANCE, CHIEF ROMNEY RIVAL IN THE POLLS HERMAN CAIN. GUY'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCANDAL INVOLVING HIS TREATMENT OF WOMEN. WATCH HIM LAY DOWN THIS TURD DISCUSSING THE HIGHEST RANKING FEMALE OFFICIAL THIS  COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD.
THE LEGISLATION HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN. WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT IN THE PREVIOUS CONGRESS BECAUSE PRINCESS NANCY SENT  IT TO COMMITTEE AND IT STAYED THERE.
Jon: PRINCESS. PRINCESS. PRINCESS NANCY. NOT I DISAGREE VEHEMENTLY WITH THE FORMER SPEAKER. NOT MINORITY LEADER PELOSI IS WRONG ON THE-- PRINCESS! YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN AGE ABOVE WHICH MOST WOMEN DO NOT WISH TO BE REFERRED TO ASPIRIN SES. AND I BELIEVE THAT AGE IS FIVE. THERE'S ONLY THREE TIMES YOU SHOULD EVER USE THAT TERM WITH AN ACTUAL FEMALE MEMBER  OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, A NEW MALL TEETION PUPPY YOU GOT, AND-- MALL TEASE PUPPY YOU GOT AND, OH, WHAT'S THE THIRD-- UH--  (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)  I'M GOING TO SAY EPA, I-- YOU KNOW, THE DEPARTMENT OF-- WE'RE GOING GET TO PERRY. ALL RIGHT SO, THAT'S HERMAN CAIN. CAN GINGRICH TAKE ADVANTAGE? HE'S GOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT. HE'S GOT NAME RECOGNITION. NEWT. AND HE'S GOT A REPUTATION AS THE RIGHT IDEA MAN. SO WHY CAN'T HE WIN? WELL, BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF THOSE IDEAS IS SEASONED WITH JUST A HINT, JUST A PINCH, JUST A LOT OF WHAT CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS DICKISHNESS. (LAUGHTER)
THE NEWS MEDIA DOESN'T REPORT ACCURATELY HOW THE ECONOMY WORKS. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A TERRIFIC JOB OF ANSWERING AN ABSURD QUESTION. TO SAY IN 30 SECONDS --
YOU HAVE SAID YOU WANT TO REPEAL OBAMACARE.
LET ME FINISH, IF I MAY, WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS THE INABILITY OF MUCH OF OUR ACADEMIC WORLD, MUCH OF OUR  NEWS MEDIA AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON OCCUPY WALL STREET TO HAVE A CLUE ABOUT HISTORY.
Jon: HMMMM, YOU KNOW, IF I MAY, NEWT, EVERYBODY LOVES THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY. BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO VOTE FOR HIS ANGRIER KNOW IT ALL BROTHER.
WHAT THE ELITIST IN THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA WON'T TELL YOU IS-- EAT A [BLEEP].
Jon: ALL RIGHT, MOVING DOWN. BECAUSE-- NO, LOOKS LIKE THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY A LITTLE BIT. (LAUGHTER) MOVING DOWN THE LIST. RON PAUL? THE GUY'S FOR GAY MARRIAGE, LEGALIZING DRUGS AND AGAINST MILITARY SPENDING. HE'S CRITICIZED RONALD REAGAN. HE CERTAINLY IS CAPABLE OF WINNING HIS PARTY'S NOMINATION, BUT THE  REPUBLICANS AIN'T HIS PARTY. (LAUGHTER) MICHELE BACHMANN, NOBODY HAS SEEN HER SINCE SHE WON THE AIMS IOWA STRAW POLL AND  STATED THE HPV VACCINE CAN DO IRREP ARABLE HARM. TURNS OUT SHE WAS RIGHT AND HER CAMPAIGN IS TRUTH. SO THAT LEAVES THREE PEOPLE, JON HUNTSMAN, RICK SANTORUM AND-- UH--  (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT? I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'LL GET TO IT HUNTSMAN, WHY CAN'T THE HANDSOME MORMON EX-GOVERNOR  BEAT MITT ROMNEY? BECAUSE HE IS MITT ROMNEY. JUST NOT QUITE. IT'S LIKE WITH THE-- BALDWINS, BILLY IS GREAT BUT GIVEN A CHOICE YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH ALEC. (APPLAUSE) WHICH BRINGS US TO SANTORUM. WHY CAN'T HE WIN? BECAUSE NOBODY WHEN GIVEN A CHOICE OF BALDWINS IS GOING WITH STEPHEN. (LAUGHTER) AND NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE REACHED OUR DESTINATION. JAMES RICHARD PERRY, RICK. THE TOUGH-TALKING, GOD-FEARING, BOOT-WEARING, PRISONER-KILLING% DISPENSER DISPENSER-COLLECTING, THAT LAST ONE IS PROBABLY NOT RIGHT, TEXAN. MANY REPUBLICAN FAITHFUL THOUGHT PERRY WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO THEIR PRAYER. BUT IT TURNS OUT HE WAS THE ANSWER TO OURS. YOU KNOW, A COMEDIAN CAN SPEND HIS WHOLE LIFE DIGGING THROUGH THE COMEDY MINDS FOR  SOUND BITES THAT HE CAN USE TO SUSTAIN HIS FAMILY. SOMETIMES A FELLOW CAN LOSE HOPE. AND THEN RICK PERRY GIVES YOU 53 SECONDS THAT CAN CHANGE A MAN'S LIFE. OH LORDY, I GIVE YOU THIS THING I FOUND, THE DOPE DIAMOND.
I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S THREE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT WHEN I GET THERE THAT ARE GONE. COMMERCE, EDUCATION AND THE, UH, WHAT'S THE THIRD ONE THERE, LET'S SEE --
YOU MEAN FIVE.
OH, FIVE, COMMERCE, EDUCATION, AND, UH, THE, UH-- UH.
EPA?
EPA, THERE YOU GO.
LET'S TALK DEFICIT REDUCTION.
SERIOUSLY. IS EPA THE ONE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.
NO, SIR.
YOU CAN'T NAME THE THIRD ONE?
THE THIRD AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT I WOULD DO AWAY WITH, EDUCATION, THE-- UH, THE-- I CAN'T-- COMMERCE -- AND LET'S SEE-- I CAN'T, THE THIRD ONE, I CAN'T. SORRY. OOPS.
Jon: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED! ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? THERE IS SO MUCH MEAT ON THAT BONE AND IT IS ALL BREAST MEAT. IT IS ALL WHITE-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH TO PICK THERE IS THE PART WHERE RON  PAUL IS TRYING TO HELP HIM OUT. HE'S GOING, I THINK YOU MEAN FIVE, OTHER PEOPLE ARE SHOUTING OUT, I THINK YOU MEAN EPA. BUT YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED TO SHOUT [BLEEP] OUT LIKE CORN DOG, JUST TO SEE IF PERRY  WOULD REPEAT IT RON BURGUNDY STYLE. AND THEN THE PART FOR JUST A SECOND PERRY LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO FAKE A STROKE TO  GET OUT OF THE WHOLE THING. WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE RIGHT MOVE. (LAUGHTER) IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT  [BLEEP] PERRY SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN LIKE-- UHU, UH, I SMELL TOAST! NO, NO, MY FAVORITE MOMENT OCCURRED JUST TOWARDS THE VERY END, JUST TOWARDS THE VERY END. LET ME JUST REPLAY IT FOR YOU VERY QUICKLY, JUST AT THE VERY END IN THE QUIET  MOMENT OF DESPERATION, AT THE END.
NOW LET'S SEE-- I CAN'T, THE THIRD ONE I CAN'T, SORRY. OOPS.
Jon: OOPS! OOPS IS! OOPS! OOPS! (LAUGHTER) THANK YOU, JESUS. OOPS! THAT IS NOT THE FOUR LETTER WORD I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH. OOPS LIKE IT'S A JUICE BOX, OH MY GOD, OH, MY CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! DOES ANYBODY HAVE A TOWEL, OOPSES. FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO OUT TO THE BEST [BLEEP] NEWS TEAM, JOHN OLIVER, I WOULD  AN SEEN AK WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS GOT TO SAY.
JON, JON, THAT MIGHT BE THE SINGLE GREATEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN. IT WAS CRAZY!
WOW, I MEAN PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT A BRAIN FART BUT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT, JON. THAT WAS SOME BRAIN EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA. YES, IT WAS LIKE HIS BRAIN WAS WEARING WHITE PANTS.
EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
ON BRAIN SCHOOL PICTURE DAY.
IT WAS AMAZING. THIS, DOESN'T THIS END HIS CHANCES BECOMING THE NOMINEE?
DON'T OVERTHINK THIS JON.
YEAH, WHO CARES. IT WAS JUST [BLEEP] AWESOME!
DID YOU SEE DAVID GREGORILUTION IT? -- GREGORY LOSE IT?
IT WAS AWESOME.
Jon: GUYS, GUYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT THE HELL!
WHAT, WHAT?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS --
I DON'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM-- .
Jon: YOUR PANTS! YOUR,-- YOU'RE BOTH AROUSED.
PLEASE, JON, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A PROFESSIONAL NEWS MAN ENJOY A PHENOMENAL STORY  LIKE THIS.
Jon: IT'S JUST, I NEVER --
IT'S CALLED A JOY BONER.
EXACTLY. JOY BONER, JON, HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T PITCHED A TENT LIKE THIS SINCE DICK CHANEY SHOT  THAT GUY IN THE FACE.
Jon: I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE ENJOYING YOURSELF BUT YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION TO  APPEAR ON TELEVISION LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S NO PROBLEM. I CAN JUST GO LIKE THIS AND LOOK NOW I'M OUT OF THE FRAME. YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT.
HE'S RIGHT, JON, AN OLD TOM BROKAW TRICK, LOOK LOOK T JUST DISAPPEARS,.
BONER, NO BONER.
