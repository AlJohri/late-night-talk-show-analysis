[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH, FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE PRESENT AT THE DAWNING OF THE NEXT EVOLUTION OF CABLE NEWS. THIS IS THE NEW HUB FOR BREAKING NEWS COVERAGE FOR ALL OF FOX NEWS CHANNEL. WE CALL IT THE FOX NEWS DECK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WELL, SHEP IT'S CERTAINLY BRIGHT. LOOKS LIKE YOU THREW ONE OF WALTER CRONKITE'S BONES INTO THE ARCTIC AND A FORTRESS OF NEWSITUDE ERUPTED FROM THE ICE. SOON YOU'LL BE TAKING ORDERS FROM A GIANT HEAD. MY SON, YOU MUST GO LIVE AMONGST THE PEOPLE OF FOX THOUGH YOU ARE NEVER FULLY ONE OF THEM BECAUSE YOUR SHOW IS ON IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN YOU ARE MARGINALLY LESS IDEALOGICAL. SHEP SMITH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE AT FOX I LIKE VERY MUCH. I THINK HE IS VERY GOOD. I THINK I SHOULD GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT EVEN IF HIS NEW DIGS DO LOOK LIKE AN APPLE GENIUS BAR HAD AN ORGASM. SPAWNING THE WORLD'S MOST RIDICULOUSLY LARGE iPAD. DO YOU KNOW HOW MAD THE GIANT YOU TOOK THOSE FROM IS GOING TO BE? FIRST HIS CREDIT CARD -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT GUY IS LOSING ALL HIS STUFF TODAY. WHAT MARVELS DOES THE NEWS-ATARIUM BOAST BEYOND TOUCH SCREENS. THIS IS WHAT REMAINS OF TROPICAL STORM KAREN.
Jon: WOW. THAT'S A BIG MAP. YOU DO KNOW THAT NO MATTER HOW HUGE YOU BLOW UP YOUR MAPS AND MONITORS FOR US OUR TELEVISIONS ARE THE SAME SIZE BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE SAME TVS WE HAD LAST WEEK. YOU COULD BE STANDING IN FRONT OF AN IMAX BUT TO ME IT'S COMING OUT OF A 32 INCH SAMSUNG.
OUR HOPE IS OVER THE DAYS AND WEEKS OF MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD WE'RE ABLE TO VET MUCH OF THIS FOR YOU.
Jon: SO IT'S ALL FOR REPORTING NOTHING THAT YOU SAID REALLY COULDN'T BE DONE USING A PHONE. [ LAUGHTER ] PAPER AND A PEN. YOU DON'T GET TO BE BETTER NEWSMEN BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS GO TO 11. WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, HEY, FOX I THINK YOU ARE FIXING THE NONBROKEN PART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE PROBLEM AT FOX NEWS HAS NEVER BEEN ITS SCREENS. REMEMBER KARL ROVE'S WHITE BOARD OR GLENN BECK'S CHALK BOARD. NO ONE EVER LOOKED AT THOSE GUYS AND THOUGHT THEY ARE (bleep) CRAZY TO BE USING SUCH ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WERE JUST (bleep). [LAUGHTER] BUT LISTEN, THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T HAPPEN A VALUED SKEPTICAL TO THE DETRIMENT OF EDITORIAL JUDGMENT DOES IT?
WHAT IT ALLOWS ME TO DO IS SCROLL THROUGH THE MEDIA OF THE DAY. THIS IS A -- THIS HAPPENS TO BE A PALESTINIAN WOMAN WHO IS HAVING A BEEF WITH AN ISRAELI SOLDIER AND THIS  TONY ROMO LAST NIGHT 506 YARDS PASSING AND MANAGED TO LOSE. THERE WAS A LATE PICK BUT WHAT A GAME.
Jon: TWO QUICK THINGS: TUPAC AND BIGGIE HAD A BEEF. THE PALESTINIAN ISRAELI CONFLICT IS MORE OF A BOTTOMLESS CUP OF SADNESS. WHILE THE COWBOYS LOSS ON SUNDAY MAY HAVE BEEN TRAGIC TO SOME, I DON'T THINK THOSE PICTURES SHOULD BE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. THIS IS WHY I'M WORRIED SHEPHERD SMITH, THIS IS WHAT WORRIES ME. THE GIANT SCREENS ARE LITERALLY FLATTENING OUT THE NEWS. SUDDENLY NOTHING HAS ANY DIFFERENCE OR CONTEXT. CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO YOU? YOU WERE TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR THEIR WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THEY ARE DESTROYING YOU WITH THE ONLY SURE FIRE WAY THEY KNOW TO RUIN A REAL NEWS MAN. THEY PUT YOU IN A SITUATION ROOM. SHEP YOU'VE BEEN CNNED YOUR STAFF HAS LOST ALL RESPECT FOR YOU. EVERY TIME YOU TURN YOUR BACK THEY ARE PLAYING FRUIT NINJA. YOU SEE THAT. SUCH A WASTE OF TIME AND DELICIOUS FRUIT. DON'T SELL YOUR SOUL FOR BELLS AND WHISTLES, MY MAN.
HE IS HELD ON SUSPICION OF MANSLAUGHTER. THAT IS THE LATEST WE'VE HEARD.
EIGHT PEOPLE DEAD AND DOZENS HURT. HUTHESE THINGS ARE FUN TO WORK WITH AREN'T THEY?
