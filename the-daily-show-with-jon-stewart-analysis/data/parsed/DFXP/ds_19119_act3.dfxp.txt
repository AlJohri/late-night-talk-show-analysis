[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CHAIRMAN AND THE C.E.O. OF STARBUCKS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM HOWARD SCHULTZ. SIR. [APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? NOW, DO YOU HAVE A "DAILY SHOW" REWARDS CARD WITH US? OR IS THAT?
NO. >>Jon: YOU CAN, IF YOU DO TEN INTERVIEWS...
GOOD IDEA, THOUGH.
Jon: YOU CAN GET ONE OF THOSE CASHEWS GLAZED WITH CRANBERRIES OR WHATEVER THE HELL YOU'RE SELLING IN THERE NOW. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT. TODAY WAS A BIG DAY FOR STARBUCKS. WE HAD A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.
Jon: NOW, TELL ME ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT. I HEARD ABOUT IT, BUT TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU'RE DOING OVER THERE.
TODAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT STARBUCKS WOULD BECOME FIRST U.S. COMPANY TO PROVIDE FREE COLLEGE TUITION FOR ALL OUR EMPLOYEES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: IT IS MY JOB TO HATE EVERYTHING. [LAUGHTER] I'M HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME WITH THIS. THIS SOUNDS LOVELY. WHERE ARE YOU SENDING THEM? [LAUGHTER]
WELL, LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. IS THIS GOING TO BE ABOUT YOU STARTED WITH ONE SHOP IN SEATTLE, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME.
NO, NO.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
UNFORTUNATELY, COLLEGE TUITION ENDEBTEDNESS IS TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
THE AVERAGE COLLEGE STUDENT HAS $30,000 IN DEBT.
Jon: YEP.
AND, WE'RE FALLING BEHIND. WE ALL KNOW THAT. SO, I THINK, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR WASHINGTON. WE'VE GOT TO STEP UP AS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND DEMONSTRATE TRUE LEADERSHIP. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING TO OUR EMPLOYEES IS WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH SOMETHING YOU CAN'T GET ON YOUR OWN. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH ASU. IT'S ONLINE.
Jon: RIGHT. AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, AND YOU SPEAK ABOUT IT A LOT.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE COUNTRY'S HAVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS. PEOPLE ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND.
Jon: THIS COUNTRY? HOW DARE YOU, SIR. YOU'VE GOT SOME VENTI BALLS, MY FRIEND. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOW, HOW DID YOU END UP DOING IT WITH ASU? I'VE HEARD THAT ONLINE ASU IS PARTY SCHOOL.
YOU HEARD THAT? WELL, THE TRUTH IS THAT ASU HAS THE BEST ONLINE PROGRAM OF ANY UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF HOMEWORK.
Jon: DID YOU APPROACH, YOU JUST APPROACHED THEM AND SAID, HEY, IF WE DO THIS WITH YOU, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO COST YOU, I READ SOMEWHERE, I THINK IT WAS FORBES, IF 3% OF YOUR EMPLOYEES TAKE THIS OFFER UP, AND IT'S A GOOD OFFER, IT'S $50 MILLION.
IT WILL BE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR, BUT I THINK HERE'S THE THING: WE'RE A PUBLIC COMPANY. WE HAVE TO BUILD LONG-TERM VALUE FOR THE SHAREHOLDER, BUT WE'VE RECOGNIZED A LONG TIME AGO WHEN WE PROVIDED HEALTH CARE FOR OUR PEOPLE, OWNERSHIP AROUND PEOPLE, THE ONLY WAY TO BUILD A GREAT, ENDURING COMPANY IS BY LINKING SHAREHOLDER VALUE WITH VALUE FOR EMPLOYEES. AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO DO SOMETHING THAT NO ONE'S DONE BEFORE, BUT ALSO...
Jon: BUT WHY IS IT THAT NO ONE'S... IT SEEMS TO MAKE PERFECT SENSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IT FROM A HUMAN... YOU KNOW, CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, WE'VE LEARNED. [LAUGHTER] BUT GENERALLY THEY'RE SOCIOPATHS. [LAUGHTER] WHY IS IT THAT YOUR CORPORATION IS ABLE TO DO THIS AND TREAT THEM HUMANLY? [APPLAUSE] BECAUSE LISTEN, THAT'S A TOUGH GIG. WORKING AT STARBUCKS, YOU DO GET GOOD PEOPLE, BUT THAT'S NOT AN EASY GIG FOR PEOPLE. IT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE.
NO, IT'S NOW. >>Jon: IT GETS BUSY AS HELL. PEOPLE CAN BE VERY DEMANDING. THESE ARE NOT EASY JOBS. AND I IMAGINE RETENTION IS DIFFICULT.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF ATTRITION OF ANY COMPANY IN OUR SECTOR, BUT I WANT TO JUST GO BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID AND WHY. WHY AREN'T COMPANIES DOING MORE OF THIS?
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A ZERO SUM GAME. THAT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS PROFITABILITY. AND WHAT I'M SAYING, AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HEARD, AND THAT IS YOU CAN'T JUST FOCUS ON PROFITABILITY. AND AN ENDURING, GREAT COMPANY HAS TO BE BASED ON MORE THAN THAT. NOW, STARBUCKS IS A PEOPLE-BASED COMPANY. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS...
Jon: OH MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE COFFEE? I THOUGHT IT WAS A COFFEE-BASED COMPANY.
NO, WHAT I MEAN BY THAT, WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE CREATED THE EXPERIENCE.
Jon: OH, OKAY.
WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EXCEED THEIR EXPECTATIONS.
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION. WE WANT TO PROVIDE IT. AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE COUNTRY IS NOT PROVIDING PEOPLE --
Jon: RIGHT. ANYTHING.
-- AT LOWER LEVELS OF OUR SOCIETY WITH THE THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE WITH PRIVILEGE HAVE. AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND WE CAN'T WAIT FOR WASHINGTON.
Jon: WHAT IS, LET ME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE AS WELL, BECAUSE IN SEATTLE, WHERE YOU'RE BASED, THEY'RE THE FIRST CITY TO RAISE IT TO $15. RIGHT?
YES.
Jon. SO, HAS THAT TAKEN EFFECT?
NO. THAT HAS NOT, THAT HAS NOT TAKEN EFFECT.
Jon: WHEN IT DOES, WILL IT RAIN CATS AND DOGS? WILL DAY BE NIGHT? WILL THE EARTH SPIN IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION? BECAUSE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, IF YOU PAY PEOPLE A WAGE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO LIVE LIKE HUMANS, MEPHISTOPHELES RISES. THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.
WELL, UH, HOW I DO ANSWER THAT? SEATTLE HAS APPROVED $15 AN HOUR. IT'S GOT TO GO TO THE VOTERS.
Jon: RIGHT. >>I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER OR NOT.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE'LL FOLLOW THE LAW. I THINK THERE WILL BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SMALL BUSINESSES NOT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. THE ISSUES IS THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY A GOOD WAGE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE TOTAL COMPENSATION. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS NOT ONLY COLLEGE TUITION, OWNERSHIP, HEALTH CARE, COMPANIES NEED DO MORE FOR THEIR PEOPLE. THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BUILD...
WHAT DO OTHER COMPANIES SAY TO YOU THEN? ARE THEY, ARE THEY ANGRY WITH YOU? LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO, YOU KNOW, CORPORATE BRUNCH OR WHATEVER HAPPENS, LIKE ARE THE GUYS FROM WAL-MART LIKE THEY SEE YOU AND THEY'RE LIKE, ARE THEY MAD?
I THINK STARBUCKS HAS ALWAYS TAKEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TRACK TO BUILDING A COMPANY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I THINK WE'VE TRIED TO EMBRACE HUMANITY AS A CORE COMPETENCY. AND I THINK MOST COMPANIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT, HERE'S THE THING, BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S SUCH TRANSPARENCY, THE CONSUMER TODAY KNOWS EVERYTHING. AND THEY ARE MAKING DECISIONS NOT ONLY ON WHAT THINGS SELL AND FEATURES AND BENEFITS, BUT YOUR VALUES AND YOUR SENSE OF PURPOSE. AND IF YOU DON'T DO THE RIGHT THING, THEY'RE GONNA REJECT YOU. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING.
WELL, I'M IMPRESSED BY IT. I THINK IT'S A REALLY NICE INITIATIVE. AND TO SHOW SUPPORT, I AM GOING TO GO TO STARBUCKS. I'M GOING TO BUY A COFFEE AND EVEN ONE OF THOSE INDY FOLK ROCK THINGS THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ON THE ALBUMS.
THANKS, JON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOWARD SCHULTZ.
