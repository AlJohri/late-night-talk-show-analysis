Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, WE HAVE A GOOD  PROGRAM. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST ONE WILLIAM JAMES  BILL O'REILLY WILL BE  DISCUSSING HIS BOOK KILLING  KENNEDY WHICH I CAN ONLY ASSUME IS A CONFESSION. LET'S GET RIGHT TO, IT. WE KNOW THIS IS A DEEPLY  DIVIDED NATION, UNTIL LAST  NIGHT WHEN SOMETHING BROUGHT  ALL AMERICANS TOGETHER IN  AGREEMENT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK A  SHELL ACTING.
HE WAS NOT PROPERLY  PREPARED FOR THIS.
THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T  BRING HIS A GAME.
HE WAS JUST SO DULL.
HE LOOKED TIRED TO ME.
ROMNEY WON HANDS DOWN.
HE WAS VERY, VERY BAD  LAST NIGHT.
Jon: THERE IS NO RED  AMERICA THERE IS NO BLUE  AMERICA THERE IS ONLY THE  AMERICA THAT CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD THIS GUY DID IN THE  DEBATE. HOW BAD WAS THE DEFEAT O  BAMA LOST DESPITE MITT  ROMNEY DOING THIS.
I'M SORRY, I WILL STOP  THE SUB SID TO PGS. I LIKE BIG BOARD, I LIKE FEW,  BUT I'M NOT GOING TO KEEP ON  SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS TO  BORROW MONEY FROM CHINA TO PAY FOR IT.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP] FIRED  BIG BOARD. AMERICA'S FAVORITE NONFRIED  BIRD. HE FIRED BIG BOARD AND WON. BELOVED CHILDREN'S  CHARACTER. ROMNEY COULD HAVE WATER  BOARDED ALADDIN, PUT DOWN  BLUE, DEPORTED DORA THE  EXPLORER. AND STILL WON WALKING AWAY. ROMNEY WON WITH THE SOUND UP.
YOUR TITLE OF THE  PRESIDENT OF YOUR OWN  AIRPLANE, HOUSE AND FACTS.
Jon: ROMNEY WON WITH THE  SOUND OFF. DUDE, HE'S YELLING AT YOU. LOOK UP. LOOK UP! WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? WHAT ARE YOU WRITING THAT'S  SO IMPORTANT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING-- OH,  THAT'S NOT-- OH, I DIDN'T  REALIZE THAT IS IMPRESSIVE  WORK. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. (APPLAUSE)  MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE THAT TO  MITT ROMNEY AS A SOUVENIR OF  THE NIGHT HE CRUSHED YOU IN  THAT DEBATE. (LAUGHTER)  AND HERE'S THE THING, OBAMA  LOST EVEN THOUGH ROMNEY WAS  LYING HIS ASS OFF THE ENTIRE  NIGHT.
ON MEDICARE FOR CURRENT  RETIREES, HE'S CUTTING $716  BILLION FROM THE PROGRAM.
Jon: NOT GUTTING $716  FROM THE PROGRAM. HE IS NEGOTIATING PAYMENTS  TO PROVIDERS AND INSURANCE  COMPANIES, AKA THE EXACT  SAME THING THAT IS IN PAUL RYAN'S BUDGET PLAN.
YOU PUT $9 O O-- $90  BILLION INTO GREEN JOBS, AND  THESE BUSINESSES, MANY OF  THEM ARE GOING OUT OF  BUSINESS. I THINK ABOUT HALF OF THEM  OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN  INVESTED IN, HAVE GONE TO  BUSINESS.
Jon: WELL, ALMOST HALF,  OUT OF NEARLY THREE DOZEN,  THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN CUT  OUT SO THAT IS ALMOST HALF EXCEPT AKA NOWHERE [BLEEP] NEAR HALF.
THE PRESIDENT SAID WE CUT  THE DEFICIT IN HALF. UNFORTUNATELY HE DOUBLED IT.
Jon: 1.2 TRILLION WHEN HE  TOOK OFFICE T IS 1.1  TRILLION NOW. MR. PRESIDENT ARE YOU JUST  GOING THROAT HIM ROLL YOU.
MR. PRESIDENT, TWO  MINUTES.
WHEN I WALKED IN THE OVAL  OFFICE I HAD MORE THAN A  TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT  GREETING ME. AND WE KNOW WHERE IT CAME  FROM. YES, WHEN TO TAKE SOME  INITIAL EMERGENCY MEASURES  TO MAKE SURE WE DIDN'T SLIP  INTO A GREAT DEPRESSION. LET'S MAKE SURE WE ARE  CUTTING OUT THOSE THINGS  THAT ARE NOT HELPING US  GROW. 18 PROGRAMS ARE-- MEDICAL  FRAUD IN MEDICARE, CUT A  TRILLION DOLLARS OUT OF OUR  DISCRETIONARY DOMESTIC  BUDGET. THE SPECIFICALLY SPECIFIC $4  TRILLION DEFICIT REDUCTION  PLAN T IS ON THE WEB SITE. YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE  NUMBERS. LET ME JUST FINISH THIS  POINT BECAUSE ARE YOU  LOOKING FOR CONTRAST.
WAY OVER TWO MINUTES.
SORRY  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU WENT OVER YOUR  TIME? AND YOU SOMEHOW MANAGED IN  ALL THAT OVERTIME TO NOT  TURN AND LOOK YOUR OPPONENT  IN THE LIE AND JUST MENTION WHAT HE SAID WAS UNTRUE? NOT EVEN A QUICK SNEEZE  BEFORE YOUR ANSWER, NO NEED  TO BE COY, LET ME SEE IF I  CAN COME UP WITH A TWO MINUTE ANSWER THAT MIGHT  HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE. LIAR! LIE, LIE, LIAR, LIE, LIE,  LIAR, LIE, LIE, LIE, LIE,  LIAR. LIE ROMNEY LIE! ROMNEY LIE, LIE. YOUR TIME IS UP.
SHOT YOUR FAT PIE HOLE  LEHRER. OPTIMISM HE-- I'M ACCOUNT  COMMAND NEVER CHIEF, I DON'T  TAKE ORDERS FROM TOTE BAG  JOHNNIE. LIE, LIE, LIE. WHAT DID YOU THINK LEHRER  WAS GOING BAIL YOU OUT. HOLD ROMNEY'S FEET TO THE  FIRE. LEHRER SPENT THE NIGHT  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS  WHO.
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU AS TO  HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT  TACKLING THE DEFICIT.
DOW BELIEVE THERE IS A  FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU AS TO  HOW YOU VIEW THE MISSION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? DO YOU SEE A MAJOR  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO  OF YOU ON SOCIAL SECURITY? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE.
LET'S MOVE TO HEALTH CARE  WHERE I KNOW THERE IS A  CLEAR DIFFERENCE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU ARE BOTH AROUND  THE SAME HEIGHTS. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN  YOUR WEIGHT? IS THERE-- I SEE ENERGYWISE  THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. THIS GENTLEMAN HERE, APPEARS  TO BE ON AMBIEN AND THE  OTHER GENTLEMAN APPEARS TO  HAVE TRIED CAFFEINE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE. YOU GUYS NOTICED THAT TOO. SERIOUSLY, IT'S LIKE MINUTES  BEFORE THE DEBATE SCOTT  BACULA QUANTUM LEAP MOOD  LEHRER'S BODY AND THEN HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE [BLEEP] HE WAS. ALL RIGHT, TWO PEOPLE ON  STAGE,S THEY ARE'S AN  AUDIENCE. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THEM. AND THEN BACULA IS LIKE DEAN  STOCKWELL, AM I HERE TO  PREVENT A CRIME OR WHAT THE  HELL IS GOING ON AROUND  HERE. ANYWAY MY POINT IS, QUANTUM  LEAP WAS A REALLY GOOD SHOW. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, HERE'S THE SADDEST  PART. DESPITE ROMNEY'S BEST  EFFORTS AT LYING THE ONLY  CATEGORY OBAMA DEFEATED  ROMNEY IN WAS THE BIGGEST  LIE OF THE NIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING TO GRADE  THE TWO OF YOU AND SAY YOUR  ANSWERS HAVE BEEN TOO LONG  OR I HAVE DONE A POOR JOB.
YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LOOK, YOU KNOW, I  DON'T GET THIS. I HONESTLY DON'T GET THIS,  MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SEEM  EITHER ANNOYED TO BE THERE  OR RELUCTANT TO MAKE YOUR CASE BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING  YOU HAVE A CASE CAN. WHICH WOULD BE A WHOLE OTHER  ISSUE. YOU KNOW, I HATE TO DO THIS  TO YOU, SIR, COMMAND NEVER  CHIEF, HI, MR. PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, LOOK, I KNOW YOU  PROBABLY DREAD HAVING TO  SPEND 90 MINUTES DEBATING  SOME KNUCKLE HEAD FROM HARVARD WHO IS JUST GOING TO  TO-- ALL NIGHT. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. I'VE BEEN THERE, OR WILL BE  SATURDAY AT 8:00. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NO CAMERA ON IN THE GREEN  ROOM, RIGHT? BUT YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT,  EVERY ONE HAS PARTS OF THEIR  JOBS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE AS  MUCH. BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO DO  THOSE THINGS IF THEY WANT TO  KEEP THOSE JOBS. AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO  IT FOR YOURSELF, THINK OF  YOUR SUPPORTERS. LOOK WHAT YOUR PERFORMANCE  DID LAST NIGHT TO ONE OF  THEM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS  DOING OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE LET  ROMNEY GET AWAY WITH THE  CRAP HE THREW OUT. WHAT WAS HE DOING TONIGHT? HE WENT IN THERE DISARMED? WHERE WAS OBAMA TONIGHT?
Jon: YOU HAPPY? MR. PRESIDENT, YOU BROKE  CHRIS MATTHEWS. NOW NOBODY CAN USE HIM. (APPLAUSE)  ADMITTEDLY MATHEWS IS RUNS A  NOT A MACHINE, EVERYONE  KNOWS HE IS A SIMPLE POTATO  BATTERY. BUT STILL, HE LIKES YOU. AND EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO  DON'T LIKE YOU WERE SOME  WHAT STUNNED AT THE POOR  PERFORMANCE. EVEN OSAMA BIN LADEN FROM  THE BOTTOM OF HIS WATERY  GRAVE WATCHED AND WAS LIKE  THAT'S THE GUY THAT KILLED  ME? (LAUGHTER)  REALLY? MR. LOOK DOWN AT THE PAPER  ALL NIGHT, SHOT ME IN THE  FACE. HERE'S WHAT'S PERHAPS MOST  MADDENING. FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF  YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE  INUNDATED THIS COUNTRY WITH  URGENT E-MAILS BEGGING FOR SUPPORT AND MONEY AND ENERGY  AND MONEY AND MONEY AND  MONEY. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBER  OF E-MAILS, IT'S THE  INTENSITY OF THEIR CONTENT  THIS IS OUR ONE SHOT. SAY YOU'RE IN. YOUR RESPONSE IS CRITICAL. I CAN'T DO THIS ON MY OWN. AND BY THE WAY, YOU MADE  THAT YOU BUND ANTLEY CLEAR  LAST NIGHT-- BUT THE POINT  IS THIS, YOU AND YOUR CAMPAIGN HAVE DEMANDED A  LEVEL OF EFFORT, URGENCY AND  RELENTLESSNESS FROM YOUR  SUPPORTERS. A LEVEL OF URGENCY AND  RELENTLESSLY YOU FAILED TO  DISPLAY IN A NATIONAL  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. SHOULDN'T YOUR URGENCY AND  PASSION BE ON PAR WITH THE  URGENCY AND PASSION OF YOUR  E-BLASTS? OR ARE YOU NOT ON YOUR  MAILING LIST. I'M TELLED TO LEAVE WITH YOU  THE WISE WORDS OF A NOTED  ACTOR WHOSE CAMPAIGN VIRAL  VIDEO HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO MY IN-BOX 1900 TIMES BY SOME  FEW OF OUR PASSIONATE  FOLLOWERS. I BELIEVE IT GOES A LITTLE  SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
WAKE THE [BLEEP] UP. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
