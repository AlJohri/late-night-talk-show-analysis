LCOME BACK, EVERYBODY. BIG NEWS. BIG NEWS. THE NEW UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE  IN. THE NEW UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS ARE  IN
THE DRAMATIC DROP IN THE  UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FROM 8.1% TO  7.8%
Jon: OH, MID GO. 8.1 TO 7.8. THE SKIES ABOVE ARE PARTLY  CLOUDY. SO, LOWEST JOBLESS NUMBER IN  NEARLY FOUR YEARS. SEEMS LIKE WE'RE MOVING IN THE  RIGHT DIRECTION OR TO PUT THAT  ANOTHER WAY...
SOME PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING  THE ACCURACY OF THE 7.8% NUMBER  THAT CAME IN FOR THE MONTH OF  SEPTEMBER
THERE IS WIDESPREAD MISTRUST  OF THIS REPORT AND THESE NUMBERS
DO YOU THINK THEY CHANGED THE  NUMBERS?
DO. I DO. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MONKEY  BUSINESS.
Jon: A LOT OF MONKEY BUSINESS  HE SAID. MONKEY BUSINESS. TRUST ME, MONKEY BUSINESS IS NOT  GOOD BUSINESS. YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTING MONKEYS. I ONCE HIRED A GROUP. NEVER AGAIN. IS THAT A BONOBO OR A CHIMP? DOES ANYONE? IS IT A CHIMP? RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BONOBO BLOG  GOING (MUMBLING). WE HAVE RED, INFLAMED ANUSS,  THAT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE  US. GOT TO BE CORRUPT POLITICAL  MANIPULATION. WHAT ELSE WOULD EXPLAIN WHY  AFTER UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN  STEADILY DECLINING FOR THE LAST  YEAR THAT NOW SUDDENLY RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, IT DECLINES  A LITTLE MORE? PLEASE! I THINK WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON  HERE.
WHAT ARE PEOPLE INTIMATING  HERE, THAT THE BOOKS ARE COOKED?
WELL A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE  SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS  COOKING THE BOOKS HERE
I'LL TELL YOU THESE GUYS ARE  SAYING THEY FEEL LIKE THEY  COOKED THE BOOKS
Jon: IF YOU'RE COOKING THE  BOOKS 7.8% UNEMPLOYMENT IS A [BLEEP] RECIPE. IT'S LIKE THE RADISH STEW OF  JOBLESS NUMBERS. IF YOU'RE COOKING, MAKE  SOMETHING NICE FOR PEOPLE. HEY, UNEMPLOYMENT IS 2.6. EVERYBODY SAYS WE'RE ALL GETTING  LAID. CALL ME WHEN THE ALLEGATION  COMES FROM SOMEONE WITH SOME  FINANCIAL CREDIBILITY.
JACK WELCH TWEETING THIS JUST  MOMENTS AFTER THE RELEASE OF  TODAY'S JOB REPORT. QUOTE, UNBELIEVABLE JOBS  NUMBERS. THESE CHICAGO GUYS WILL DOING  ANYTHING. CAN'T DEBATE. SO CHANGE THE NUMBERS."
Jon: IF LEGENDARY FORMER CEO  OF GENERAL ELECTRIC IS ALLEGING  DISHONESTY TO THE BUREAU OF  LABOR STATISTICS, YOU CAN SURE HE'S GOT HARD CORE EVIDENCE
I HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE  THAT.
Jon: OKAY. BUT ISN'T HIS CERTAINTY DESPITE  HIS LACK OF EVIDENCE HIS OWN  KIND OF EVIDENCE?
I KNOW THIS. THIS ECONOMY DOESN'T FEEL LIKE  THE EMPLOYMENT IMPROVED TO THIS  LEVEL
THESE NUMBERS DON'T SMELL  RIGHT
Jon: THEY DON'T FEEL RIGHT. THEY DON'T SMELL RIGHT. THAT'S TWO OF THE FIVE SENSES. JACK, HOW DOES THIS JOBS REPORT  TASTE? THAT WAS OUR ONLY COPY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY REAL EVIDENCE. HOW ABOUT IF YOU PRESENT YOUR  LACK OF EVIDENCE
MAYBE IT'S A COINCIDENCE. THAT THE MONTH BEFORE THE  ELECTION WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT  COMES OUT ONE TENTH BELOW WHEN  THE PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE. FROM AN IDEOLOGUE DIVISION OF  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THEY  DO IT. THEY'RE FILLED WITH ASSUMPTIONS,  ERIC
JACK, I'M NOT A BELIEVER IN  COINCIDENCES. I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY IN  LIFE.
Jon: NO COINCIDENCES? YOUR LIFE MUST BE A CONSTANT  SERIES OF UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. INTERESTING. IT RAINED ON THE ONLY TWO DAYS I  HAD OFF. OBAMA! IT JUST MAKES ME WONDER IF THESE  GOOD NUMBERS FROM THE B.L.S. ARE  CLEARLY A CONSPIRACY, WHAT WERE  THE EARLIER LESS POSITIVE NUMBERS FROM THE B.L.S. CONSIDERED?
WHEN YOU GO STRICTLY BY THE  BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS  NUMBERS, THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE  ON UNEMPLOYMENT NOW THAN WHEN OBAMA TOOK OFFICE. A LOSS OF 1.7 MILLION JOBS UNDER  PRESIDENT OBAMA. THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS. READ 'EM AND WEEP. B.L.S..GOV
I'M NOT READING THEM AND  WEEPING.
I'M READING THE NUMBERS   SEE YOU ARE. I'LL TELL YOU THIS. RIGHT FROM THE BUREAU.
Jon: ONE MAN WITH TWO  CONFLICTING POINTS OF VIEW. OF THE SAME GOVERNMENT BUREAU'S  NUMBERS. CO-ENS DENSE OR COINCIDENCE? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK OR WILL WE?
