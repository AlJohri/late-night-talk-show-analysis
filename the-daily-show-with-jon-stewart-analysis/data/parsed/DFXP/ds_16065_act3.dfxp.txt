WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST GUEST TONIGHT IS THE INTERNATIONAL BEST SELLING AUTHOR OF THE MEN WHO... HIS  NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE PSYCHOPATH TEST. THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE MADNESS INDUSTRY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JOHN RON SEN.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE'RE ALL HUGE FANS OF YOURS. WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT YOU COULD BE HERE.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.
Jon: THE PSYCHOPATH TEST. WHY, JOHN, WHY? WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE WAY OF PSYCHOPATHS?
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I'M A VERY ANXIOUS PERSON. I SUFFER WITH DEBILITATING ANXIETIES TO HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY WANT TO KILL ME. I'M THE NEURO LOGICAL OF THE PSYCHOPATH. THE PSYCHOPATH KNOWS NO ANXIETY AND I FEEL TOO MUCH ANXIETY. PSYCHOPATH ARE PEOPLE WHO COULD PROBABLY....
Jon: THANKED GOD. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING HOST ON THAT ONE. WHEN YOU'RE WITH A PSYCHOPATH, DOES HE RECOGNIZE HIS POLAR OPPOSITE? DOES HE... IS IT LIKE YOU KNOW THAT MOVIE BRUCE WILLIS AND SAMUEL L.JACKSON, THE SUPER  HERO HAS TO HAVE A NEMESIS. DO THEY SEE YOU AS THEIR NEMESIS?
THEY SEE ME AS THEIR PLAY THING.
Jon: OH, GEEZ.
THERE'S A FANTASTIC GUY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHO USED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE HAITIAN  DEATH SQUAD. HE'S NOW IN PRISON FOR INSURANCE FRAUD IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. HE GOT AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE HE WAS WORKING FOR THE C.I.A..
Jon: THANK GOD FOR SAYING HE'S IN PRISON. NOW I JUST FELT LIKE REAL HE'LL UPSTATE NEW YORK? HE'S JUST UP THERE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. 12 TO 37 YEARS FOR INSURANCE FRAUD SO YOU'RE OKAY. MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M OKAY. WHEN I TURNED UP, HE SAID... I WAS SO EXCITED. EVERYONE WOULD SAY WOW YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. I PUT ON A SPECIAL GREEN SHIRT. I GOT MY HAIRCUT. I WAS THINKING, OH, MYED GOD, I COME TO FIND OUT THIS GUY IS A PSYCHOPATH AND HE'S SO EXCITED ABOUT MEETING ME. I DON'T REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO LIKE ME. I WAS THINKING THIS ISN'T VERY PSYCHOPATHIC. I'VE DRIVEN SIX HOURS FROM NEW YORK AND HE'S NOT BEING VERY PSYCHOPATHIC. FINALLY I SAID TO HIM ISN'T THAT A KIND OF WEAKNESS THAT YOU REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO LIKE YOU? HE SAID IT'S NOT A WEAKNESS. I'LL TELL YOU WHY. I SAID WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU CAN GET PEOPLE TO LIKE YOU, YOU CAN MANIPULATE THEM TO DO WHATEVER  YOU WANT THEM TO DO.
Jon: PSYCHOPATH.
YEAH.
Jon: HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET HIM TO REVEAL THE FACE OF THE PSYCHOPATH?
ABOUT THREE HOURS. I MET HIM ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO.
Jon: WHEN HE WAS NOT IN PRISON.
HE WAS LIVING WITH HIS MOTHER IN QUEENS. HE DID THIS DEAL....
Jon: REALLY?
HE DID A DEAL WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WOULDN'T EXPEDITE HIM TO HAITI  TO STAND TRIAL FOR WAR CRIMES BUT HE HAD TO LIVE WITH HIS MOTHER IN QUEENS. HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO GO INTO MANHATTAN. HE WOULD CRY AND HAD A MISTY- EYED LOOK ON HIS FACE. ANYHOW, I MET HIM THEN. AT ONE POINT DURING THE INTERVIEW 15 YEARS AGO HE STARTEDED PRETENDING TO CRY. YOU KNOW, I'M INNOCENT OF ALL THE CRIMES. HE WAS LIKE CRYING BUT IT WAS LIKE KIND OF PRETENDING TO CRY. IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY ODD, YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME I WAS THINKING, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING  WITH THIS GUY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CONNECTING ON ANY KIND OF HUMAN LEVEL. LATER WHEN I WAS THINKING, WOW, IS IT TRUE THAT PSYCHOPATHS RULE THE WORLD WHICH IS WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS BELIEVE, WHICH  IS WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT, THAT BASICALLY THE BRAIN ANOMALY THAT PSYCHOPATHS SUFFER FROM IS THE BRAIN  ANOMALY THAT AFFECTS US ALL.
Jon: TALKING ABOUT THE BOOK I WAS EXPECTING EVERYTHING TO BE THE GUY WHO HAS THE BODIES  BURIED IN THE BACKYARD. IT'S VERY PREVALENT AND YOU WORK WITH THEM. THEY ARE... ONE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE.
ONE OUT OF 100 PEOPLE, REGULAR PEOPLE WALKING AROUND ARE PSYCHOPATHS. SAY PSYCHOLOGISTS. 25% OF THE PRISON POPULATION ARE PSYCHOPATHS. BUT 4% OF CORPORATE CHIEFS ARE PSYCHOPATHS.
Jon: NOW ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT A PSYCHOPATH IS, HOW DO YOU NOT WITH EVERYBODY THAT YOU  MEET PLAY THE PSYCHOPATH GAME TO FIND OUT IF... IS THIS PERSON HUMAN OR PRETENDING TO  BE HUMAN TO MANIPULATE ME TO GET WHAT HE WANTS.
BECOMING DRUNK WITH POWER ON TWITTER AND PEOPLE WHO GIVE ME BAD REVIEWS. YOU KNOW....
Jon: YOU SEE THEM EVERYWHERE.
I STARTED SEEING THEM EVERYWHERE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS LOT WITH PEOPLE. LUCKILY I WAS JUST A KIND OF SELF-REFLECTIVE AUTHOR BUT CRIMINAL PROFILERS WHO POLICE  BELIEVE AND ATTORNEYS AND PAROLE HEARINGS AND SO ON.
Jon: EVERYWHERE.
THAT'S WHEN IT GETS KIND OF DANGEROUS. THE PSYCHOPATH TEST IS THIS 20- POINT CHECKLIST.
Jon: TOUGH TAKE THE TEST. I TOOK THE TEST. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT I'M JUST NEUROTIC. I'M TELLING YOU, WHAT THIS MAN HAS GIVEN TWO YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO DO, IT WOULD BE LIKE  WRITING A BOOK IF YOU'RE DEATHLY AFRAID OF SPIDERS. YOU'VE DONE AN AMAZING SERVICE AND PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE TEST, SIR. YOU ARE THE HIGHLANDER. THE PSYCHOPATH TEST IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. GET AHOLD OF
