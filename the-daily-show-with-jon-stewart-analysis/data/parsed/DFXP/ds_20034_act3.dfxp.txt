Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT, A FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR AND AN ACADEMY AWARD WINNING DIRECTOR. THEY ARE HERE TO DISCUSS A P.S.A. CALLED "LAST DAYS." ♪♪ (SIREN) (SCREECHING) (ROARING) (SCREECHING) (ROARING) (BIRD SOUNDS)  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM KATHRYN BIGELOW AND JUAN ZARATE! HELLO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ HAVE A SEAT! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, AND WE'LL GET TO BOY, THAT FILM HAS, SHE SHOWED ME THAT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND THEN IT GOT US INTERESTED IN DOING THIS PIECE. IT'S PHENOMENAL AND AN INCREDIBLE STORY. AND WE'LL GET TO THAT IN A SECOND. THE C.I.A. REPORT DROPPED TODAY. HERE DIRECTED "ZERO DARK 30," AS YOU WATCH THAT YOU SEE ALL THESE REPORTS COME OUT, THE C.I.A. HAS BEEN LYING ABOUT THE EFFICACY, THEY LIED ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY TORTURED. DOES THIS BLOW YOUR MIND? DID YOU SEE THIS AND THINK, OH, MY GOD, WERE THEY LYING TO ME? IS THE WHOLE NARRATIVE DIFFERENT?
INTERESTING QUESTION. I MEAN, I REALLY MADE THE MOVIE BASED ON THE REPORTING THAT WE DID AT THE TIME.
Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN, I APPLAUD TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT SO I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S OUT THERE. BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK, IT'S COMPLICATED. IT'S VERY, VERY VERY COMPLICATED.
Jon: YEAH, MIND BLOWING, I TELL YEAH. IT'D BE A GOOD DVD EXTRA. I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL EXTRA COPIES. I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF LITTLE COMMENTS IN THERE. BUT THIS HERE, THIS, YOU KNOW, WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS FILM ABOUT THE ELEPHANT TRADE AND HOW DOES JUAN WHO WORKS IN NATIONAL SECURITY GET INVOLVED IN THIS? IT'S A MIND-BLOWING STORY.
WELL, OVER A YEAR AGO, I CAME UPON SOME INFORMATION WHERE ELEPHANT POACHING -- I WAS ALREADY IN THE ELEPHANT POACHING SPACE ACTUALLY KIND OF INTERESTED IN MAKING A FEATURE ABOUT IT -- BUT I REALIZED THERE WAS AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN ELEPHANT POACHING AND TERRORISM. LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WESTGATE MALL, WHICH WAS IN THAT LITTLE PIECE THERE THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS A CONNECTION THERE THAT THE AL-SHABAAB  WHO TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WESTGATE MALL WAS FINANCING THEIR NEFARIOUS ACTS THROUGH ELEPHANT POACHING. I WOULD CALL IT AN ELEPHANT EMERGENCY IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT A DECADE LEFT OF ELEPHANTS IN THE WILD AT THE RATE OF SLAUGHTER THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND --
Jon: SO THIS HAS PICKED UP? THIS IS SOMETHING -- THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS BUT NOW THAT TERRORISM IS INVOLVED, THEY'RE TAKEN IT UP A NOTCH?
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S ON AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE. WHAT YOU HAVE WITH WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING IS REALLY THE FOURTH LARGEST ILLICIT FINANCING NETWORK ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.
Jon: IT'S A BLACK ECONOMY NOW. DRUGS, GUNS --
BLACK ECONOMY. OVER $23 BILLION A YEAR.
Jon: AND WILDLIFE.
RIGHT. AND IVORY HAS EXPLODED IN TERMS OF VALUE. CHINA IS A MAJOR DEMANDER FOR THE PRODUCTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
CERTAINLY THE U.S. AS WELL. AND WHAT YOU SEE AS KATHRYN HAS POINTED OUT SO VIVIDLY IN THE FILM IS THAT THESE GROUPS, AL-SHABAAB MOVEMENT WHICH IS CONNECTED TO AL QAEDA IN SOMALIA.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE JANJAWEED MILITIA RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE ATROCITIES IN DARFUR, THEY'RE IN ON THIS AS WELL. YOU HAVE AS WELL THE LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY, KEEP IN MIND, THEY'RE THE MASSIVE KIDNAPPERS OF CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE KILLED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THEY'VE ALL TAPPED INTO THIS NETWORK AND TO THIS ECONOMY AND ARE PROFITING FROM IT. AND SO, THIS IS REALLY WHERE OUR NATIONAL SECURITY MEETS OUR NATURAL SECURITY AND THAT'S WHY I JOINED WITH KATHRYN TO HELP HER OUT.
Jon: SO THIS IS, AND YOU COME UP WITH THIS FILM AND IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DONE AND VERY ARTISTICALLY RENDERED, BUT THERE IS THE CONNECTION WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU THINK, OH, MY GOD, THAT LITTLE ELEPHANT I HAVE THAT I GOT IN THE SOUVENIR SHOP --
WELL, RIGHT. WELL IT'S KIND OF --
I MEAN, THEY SAID IT WASN'T IVORY BUT MAYBE IT IS IVORY AND MAYBE THIS IS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS TRADE.
EXACTLY. I MEAN, THIS IS THE SORT OF TERRORISM THAT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT BY NOT BUYING THESE LITTLE TRINKETS, BY NOT SUPPORTING THIS TRADE. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT A, YOU KNOW, STOP ON THEIR REVENUE STREAM.
Jon: BUT DIDN'T WE DO THAT? IN THIS COUNTRY, WE MADE THE IVORY TRADE ILLEGAL, YES?
YEAH THERE WAS A PERIOD BOTH IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY WHERE THERE WAS REALLY A BAN ON IVORY TRADE. THAT HAS NOW INCREASED AND NOW WITH THE INCREASING WEALTH IN ASIA, THIS DEMAND HAS PICKED UP AND THESE GROUPS ARE PROFITING.
AND ACTUALLY NEW YORK IS THE SECOND BIGGEST MARKET IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF ASIA.
I USED TO LIVE DOWN ON CANAL STREET. AND THEY SELL THE LITTLE -- I MEAN IT'S AN IVORY ELEPHANT. THEY ACTUALLY CARVE THE THING THAT THEY GOT IT FROM.
AND THE TRAGEDY IS THEY ACTUALLY CUT THE FACE OFF OF THE ELEPHANT SOMETIMES WHILE THEY'RE STILL ALIVE TO GET THE TUSKS OUT.
Jon: IT'S HORRIBLE.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
SO, WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW WHEN YOU SAY WELL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. I MEAN, WE TRIED THAT WITH MILEAGE FOR OUR CARS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO USING OIL. THAT DIDN'T WORK.
WELL, ONE ELEPHANT -- THAT'S TRUE. ONE ELEPHANT IS APPROXIMATELY KILLED EVERY 15 MINUTES. MY HOPE IS WELL WE HAVE THIS WEB SITE, THERE ARE A LOT OF ACTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THERE. YOU CAN WRITE INTERPOL, YOU CAN WRITE THE U.N., YOU CAN WRITE THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU CAN WRITE CONGRESSMEN, THEY'RE ACTUALLY A BIPARTISAN COALITION THAT IS THERE TO SUPPORT THE ELEPHANTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THE ELEPHANTS. BUT MY HOPE IS WE COULD PERHAPS CREATE AN ACTIVIST EVERY 15 MINUTES.
Jon: WITHIN THE COUNTRIES THAT THIS IS OCCURRING, IS THERE A MOVEMENT TO PREVENT THIS OR IS IT BEYOND THEIR SCOPE AND BEYOND THEIR CONTROL?
WELL THE PROBLEM IS THE POACHERS, THE NETWORKS AND TERRORISTS ARE OUTGUNNING AND OUTSPENDING THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THERE'S A RECOGNITION. YOU KNOW, THE LOSS OF THE ELEPHANTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS REALLY A LOSS IN TOURIST REVENUE.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S A LOSS IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. SO THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM, BUT THESE ARE GROUPS THAT ARE VIOLENT, THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL NOT JUST ELEPHANTS BUT PEOPLE. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'VE GOT.
WELL, LIKE THE WESTGATE -- WELL, EXACTLY.
Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY AND THAT'S WHAT'S FUNDING THESE THINGS.
SO YOU'RE NOT JUST SAVING ELEPHANTS. EXACTLY. YOU'RE NOT JUST SAVING ELEPHANT, YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE A DECADE BEFORE THEY WILL BE EXTINCT.
Jon: WELL, I HAVE TO SAY, AS A METHOD FOR GETTING IT OUT, IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WORK AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND THANK YOU FOR SHOWING IT TO ME AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT AND THANKS FOR BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS, AND YOU AS WELL.
THANK YOU.
