FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [ APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. OBVIOUSLY, I AM NOT JON  STEWART. MY NAME IS JASON JONES. JON IS OUT SICK TONIGHT WITH A BAD CASE OF SOMETHING CALLED THE BUBONS. I'M NOT SURE I'M PRONOUNCING  THAT RIGHT. THE BUBONS, I THINK. IT'S APPARENTLY AN ILLNESS THAT AFFECTS ONLY PEOPLE FROM NEW JERSEY. SO, HE SHOULD BE BACK TOMORROW, BUT HE DID SEND IN A PICTURE IN THE MEANTIME. THAT'S, I'M SORRY. THAT'S, THAT IS A PHOTO OF ME. THAT'S THE MOMENT I FOUND OUT  I HAD TO HOST THE SHOW  TONIGHT. BUT WE HAVE GOT, WE HAVE GOT A GREAT PROGRAM TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY OUR DEAR FRIEND WYATT CENAC IS HERE. [ APPLAUSE ]
THE CENAC ATTACK. FOKS, THIS HAS BEEN A CRAZY FEW DAYS FOR ME. A WEEK AGO, AND THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUE, I OFFICIALLY BECAME AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. [ APPLAUSE ] FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T  KNOW, I WAS BORN IN CANADA. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, WHAT WAS I THINKING, RIGHT? STUPID. BUT AS AN AMERICAN, I NOW HAVE  THE RIGHT, THE SACRED RIGHT TO  PARTICIPATE IN OUR ELECTIONS,  TO VOTE. OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY NOT NEXT MONTH, IT'S JUST THE (BLEEP) MIDTERMS. WHO GIVES A (BLEEP)? BUT FOLKS, I AM GEARED UP TO PICK A  PRESIDENT IN 2016. NOW TRADITIONALLY, THE VICE  PRESIDENT GETS THE NEXT AT  BAT. GIVE ME A LITTLE TASTE OF MR.  JOE BIDEN.
ANOTHER VERBAL FAUX PAS FROM VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.
OKAY, THAT'S FINE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. INSTEAD OF A VERBAL FAUX PAS, COULD HAVE COMMITTED A FASHION  FAUX PAS. I MEAN SERIOUSLY, COME ON, STARTING A WAR IN A TAN SUIT IT'S JUST NOT DONE. ALRIGHT, SO WHAT DID BIDEN SAY?
YESTERDAY AT HARVARD A  STUDENT IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS  THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE  STUDENT BODY. BIDEN HAD THIS TO SAY.
I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF THE  STUDENT BODY. ISN'T IT A BITCH? I MEAN -- EXCUSE ME. THIS VICE PRESIDENT THING. I'M JOKING, I'M JOKING. [ APPLAUSE ]
NOW I LIKE THIS GUY. I LIKE JOE. HE SPEAKS HIS MIND. OK -- OH YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY. I WASN'T IN THAT MEETING. BUT BEING SECOND IN COMMAND IS  A BITCHY (BLEEP) JOB. KAY, NEVER GETING TO SIT IN THE  CAPTAIN'S CHAIR. WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO  HAPPEN TO THE BOSS'S HEALTH  BEFORE YOU GET YOUR CHANCE TO DO  ANYTHING. AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE READY. THAT HAS GOT TO BE, I WOULD IMAGINE, INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. [ APPLAUSE ] BUT LET ME TELL YOU, THIS BIDEN  GUY, HE HAS MY VOTE. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST ONE SLIP UP,  WASN'T IT?
BIDEN DOES IT  AGAIN.
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN  STICKING HIS FOOT IN HIS  MOUTH.
A MAJOR FLUB.
HIS OFF THE CUFF STYLE HAS GETTEN HIM INTO TROUBLE YET AGAIN.
OKAY, MAYBE HE NEEDS A LITTLE  MORE SEASONING. OKAY? IT TURNS OUT THE JOB IS NOT AS  EASY AS TO LOOKS. I THINK I MIGHT THROW UP AGAIN. BUT LOOK, THE GUY IS A FOREIGN  POLICY EXPERT TAKING QUESTIONS  FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS ABOUT  OUR NEW WAR ON ISIS. HOW BAD CAN IT BE?
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS OUR  ALLIES.
OKAY, I WAS, I WAS GOING TO GO WITH OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS OUR ENEMIES BUT YOU'RE THE EXPERT.
THE TURKS WHO ARE GREAT FRIENDS.  AND I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH ERDOGAN, WHICH I JUST SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH. THE SAUDIS, AND THE EMIRATES,  ET CETERA.
OKAY, DID HE USE THE OLD, HEY, SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE THE TURKS? THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD. >>THEY POURED HUNDREDS OF  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND TENS THOUSANDS OF TONS OF WEAPONS  INTO ANYONE WHO WOULD FIGHT  AGAINST ASSAD, EXCEPT THAT THE PEOPLE  WHO WERE BEING, WHO WERE BEING SUPPLIED WERE AL-NUSRA AND AL-QUEDA AND THE EXTREMIST ELEMENT OF JIHADIES  COMING FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE  WORLD.
I'M JUST SAYING IF ALL OF OUR  ALLIES IN THE REGION DIDN'T  HAVE THEIR HEADS SO FAR UP  THEIR TURKISH ASSESS, THEY  NEVER WOULD HAVE INADVERTENTLY SUPPLIED THE TERRORIST NIGHTMARE THAT WE'RE NOW FIGHTING. BUT LOOK, WE ALL HAVE FRIENDS  THAT WE THINK ARE MORONS. OKAY. TO FRIENDSHIP. OH THAT'S RIGHT, YOU DON'T DRINK. WHY ARE WE FRIENDS AGAIN? NOW IF I KNOW TURKEY, WHICH I DON'T, THEY'RE GOING TO BE PRETTY OKAY WITH BEING ACCUSED OF UNWITTINGLY FUNDING A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
TURKEY'S PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS  OUTRAGED BY THE COMMENT.
WE HAVE NEVER PROVIDED HELP AND SUPPORT TO ANY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. NOBODY CAN PROVE OTHERWISE. IF BIDEN HAS USED SUCH EXPRESSIONS, HE WILL BE HISTORY FOR ME.
HE IS DEAD TO TURKEY. HE WILL NOT TRAVEL TO  TURKEY. HE WILL NOT EAT TURKEY. HE WILL BE CONDEMNED TO CONSUME  TOFURKEY. I GUESS WHAT I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HERE IS WHY EXACTLY WHAT BIDEN SAID WAS CONTROVERSIAL? CAUSE, YOU KNOW, MOST OF WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID WAS ACTUALLY TRUE.
SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR AND THE  UNITED ARAB EMIRATES HAVE IN  DIFFERENT WAYS BEEN POURING  LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH INTO THE  SYRIAN REBEL MOVEMENT, AND  OFTEN THE MORE EXTREMIST, MORE ORGANIZED GROUPS END UP GETTING THEIR HANDS UPON IT.
SO NO, YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY BASICALLY SAYING OUTLOUD WHAT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING.
EXACTLY. ALL HE DID WAS SAY THE TRUTH THINGS WE'RE ALL THINKING.   BIDEN IS BASICALLY THE  SEINFELD OF VICE PRESIDENTS. DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN TURKEY  GIVES MONEY TO SYRIAN REBELS  AND THEN THEY TURN OUT TO BE  AL-QUEDA. IT'S LIKE, WHO ARE THESE MILITANTS? SERIOUSLY: TELL US, WE'LL WATERBOARD YOU. (APPLAUSE) SO APPARENTLY, THE WAY TO CREATE A DIPLOMATIC CRISIS IS TO SAY SOMETHING TRUE. BUT HEY, I DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT WHO'S ALL ABOUT MAKING FRIENDS. SURE BIDEN'S NOT POLISHED, BUT HE STANDS UP FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES AND NEVER BACKS DOWN.
OVER THE WEEKEND BIDEN  CALLED TURKEY'S PRESIDENT AND THE CROWN PRINCE OF ABU DHABI, AN IMPORTANT LEADER IN THE EMIRATES TO APOLOGIZE.
OH COME ON, JOE. COME ON, JOE. YOU APOLOGIZED AND WITH A PHONE CALL? THAT'S WHAT TEXTS ARE FOR. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY INVENTED  EMOJIS. KAY, YOU JUST, YOU JUST TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE AND THEN YOU JUST TYPE IN A LITTLE EYE, YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW. AND THEN (BLEEP) AND THEN UP COMMA, TURKEY. THAT SAYS IT ALL IN STYLE. BIDEN, 2016. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
