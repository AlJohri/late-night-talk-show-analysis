(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HER NEW FILM  IS CALLED "BUTTER."
YOU WANT A COOKIE BECAUSE  YOU'RE GOING TO GET PREGNANT?
I GET PREGNANT LIKE ONCE A  MONTH!
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK YOU'RE  ANYTHING MORE THAN A CHEAP LAY  TO HIM? HE'LL GET BORED. AFTER THAT HE'LL COME RIGHT BACK  WHERE HE BELONGS-- TO MY HOUSE.
LISTEN WOULD YOU PREFER IT IF  I DIDN'T ENTER THIS WHOLE BUTTER  CONTEST THING?
ABSOLUTELY.
EXCELLENT! IT'S ON. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME OLIVIA  WILDE. HELLO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OLIVIA WILDE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, THE  MOVIE IS-- NOT ONLY IS THE MOVIE  FUNNY, NEW IT WITH SOME OF OUR  FAVORITE PEOPLE HERE. YOUR ROB CORD DRIES, YOUR  CHRISTIAN SCHAAL.
YOUR DIRE STAFF IS IN THIS  MOVIE. PATRICK STEWART WHO IS NOW ON  OUR STAFF WILL BE IN THIS MOVIE.
I BEAT HIM OUT BY, LIKE, ONE  AWE DECONTAMINATION. (LAUGHTER)  IT WAS NECK IN NECK. IT WAS ROUGH WHEN I SAW HIM BACK  STATION.
Jon: HE'S NOT OVER IT, IS  HE? HE NEVER GETS OVER IT. HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE DOING-- YOU HAVE SO MANY  INTERESTING THINGS I HAVE TO ASK  YOU ABOUT. CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS, ONE OF OUR  FAVORITE GUESTS ON THIS PROGRAM,  THE LATE GREAT CHRISTOPHER  HITCHENS WAS YOUR BABYSITTER.
(LAUGHS)  YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: HOW DID THAT-- FIRST  OF ALL, HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE? (LAUGHTER)  SECOND OF ALL--
I KNOW, MY BLOOD IS RUNNING  WITH SCOTCH. (LAUGHTER)  HE WAS AMAZING.
Jon: WAS HE JUST A NEIGHBOR  AND YOUR FOLKS WON'T OVER THERE  AND SAID, LIKE, "HEY, DUDE, CAN COULD YOU WATCH OUR KIDS?"
"HOLD OUR BABY, YOU LOOK  TRUSTWORTHY."  (LAUGHTER).
Jon: EXACTLY. WAS YOUR FAMILY FRIENDS?
YES, THEY WERE ALL  JOURNALISTS TOGETHER. THERE'S THIS GREAT GROUP OF  INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS AND  SADLY THEY'RE DYING OUT SLOWLY  BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND I WAS VERY LUCKY TO KNOW  HIM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WE USED TO LOVE HAVING  HIM ON THE SHOW. AND I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED AT HIS  BREADTH OF RECALL BECAUSE HE  HAD--
RIGHT, I KNOW, ONE WOULD  THINK THERE WOULDN'T BE MUCH  RECALL. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: IF I GET LET'S SAY  FOUR HOURS OF SLEEP I CAN'T  REMEMBER WHEN THINK BIRTHDAY IS  BUT THIS GUY--
I KNOW!
Jon: I ALWAYS WONDERED IF  YOU PICKLE YOUR BRAIN--
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT DOES  IT.
Jon: IS-- IS THAT HOW IT  KEEPS IN THE SO WELL. HE IS SO MISSED. THE WRITING AND EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU HAVE A SPECIAL COMING UP  ON-- WHERE IS IT AIRING?
PBS. IT'S VERY COOL. IT'S A DOCUMENTARY CALLED "HALF  THE SKY" BASED ON THE GREAT BOOK  KREUPB BY NICHOLAS KRISTOF. IT'S ABOUT WOMEN IN THE  DEVELOPING WORLD WHO STARTED  AMAZING ORGANIZATIONS TO TURN  OPPRESSION INTO OPPORTUNITY AND I GOT TO GO TO KENYA WITH NICK  KRISTOF WHICH WAS AMAZING AND WE  HAD A GREAT TIME.
Jon: IS THAT YOUR FIRST  TIME IN KENYA?
YES.
Jon: I HAVE NEVER BEEN. I'VE BEEN TO NEARBY--  CONNECTICUT IS NOT NEAR THERE,  IS IT? WHERE IS KENYA?
IF YOU GO A FEW MILES NORTH,  ACROSS A BIG OCEAN.
Jon: SO THERE IS WATER.
YOU GET THERE. IT'S AMAZING. MOST PEOPLE KNOW KENYA FOR THE  SAFARIS AND ANIMALS AND THAT'S  EXTRAORDINARY AND EVERYONE  SHOULD SEE THAT. BUT KENYA HAS INCREDIBLE PEOPLE  AND ALSO A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND  THERE'S A LOT OF OPPRESSION OF  WOMEN SO I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET SOME OF THESE WOMEN WHO  STARTED MICROFINANCING  ORGANIZATIONS WHICH IS A GREAT  TOOL IN ENDING GLOBAL POVERTY AND GOT TO HANG OUT WITH THEM. I GOT TO GO TO A VILLAGE OF ALL  WOMEN. ALL WOMEN.
Jon: A VILLAGE OF ALL  WOMEN.
YEAH!
Jon: IS THAT ON PURPOSE? DID THEY KICK THE MEN OUT? (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY DID. IT'S GREAT. EVERYTHING WORKS SO WELL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S FANTASTIC! IT'S A VILLAGE-- THEY HAD TO  CREATE THIS VILLAGE--  (LAUGHTER). TO ESCAPE OPPRESSION AND  VIOLENCE.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU  PERSONALLY. ARE THERE DANCES? ARE THERE TIMES WHEN THEY WOULD  INVITE MEN OVER FOR TEA?
(LAUGHS)  FOR TEA. THEY INVITED ME OVER AND THEY  WERE SINGING A SONG AND THEY  WERE DANCING WHEN I ARRIVED AND  I WAS DANCING ALONG AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS A WELCOME SONG  AND I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AND  LATER I SAID "WHAT WERE WE ALL  SINGING TOGETHER?" AND THEY SAID "THAT WAS THE  VAGINA SONG."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND I THOUGHT "HOW DID THEY KNOW  THAT THAT WAS MY SONG? THEY MUST HAVE GOOGLED ME. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHAT IS THE VAGINA  SONG AND IS IT ANYTHING LIKE  THAT "CALL ME MAYBE"? (LAUGHTER)
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF  COPYRIGHT ISSUES THERE.
Jon: NOW ARE THEY ABLE TO--  AS THEY TAKE IT OFF-- DO THEY  FIND-- THEY FIND STRENGTH IN  EACH OTHER? THEY'VE OVERCOME THESE TERRIBLE  CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY'RE  BUILDING THIS. WILL THEY BE ABLE TO PROTECT  THIS SECURITY THAT THEY HAVE  NOW? HOW ARE THEY ABLE TO--
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS. THEY GET ATTACKED ALL THE TIME. IT'S VERY SCARY. BUT THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. THEY HAVE A BUSINESS, THEY MAKE  JEWELRY SO THAT THEY CAN SELL IT  AND SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. BUT IT'S SCARY. I MEAN, I THINK THE MEN ARE VERY  JEALOUS THEY'RE RUNNING SUCH A  GREAT VILLAGE.
Jon: AND THEY'VE DONE SO  WELL FOR THEMSELVES. I WISH YOU THE BEST. WHEN IS THAT ON?
THAT'S ON OCTOBER 1 AND 2 ON  PBS AT 9:00 P.M.
Jon: I WOULD URGE EVERYONE  TO WATCH IT AND ALSO SEE  "BUTTER."
SEE "BUTTER"!
Jon: AVAILABLE ON DEMAND  AND IN THEATERS OCTOBER 5. OLIVIA
