NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART."  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. NEWARK MAYOR CORY BOOKER WILL BE  JOINING US, BUT LET'S BEGIN  TONIGHT AS I REALLY SHOULD BEGIN ALMOST EVERY NIGHT, WITH AN  APOLOGY. WE'VE HAD A BIT OF FUN HERE OVER  THE YEARS CONCERNING WHAT IS  COMMONLY REFERRED TO THIS TIME OF YEAR AS THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS  WHERE A SMALL BAND OF 70% OF THE  COUNTRY HAVE FOUGHT TIRELESSLY FOR THE RIGHT TO OPENLY  CELEBRATE THE FEAST DAY OF THEIR  LORD'S BIRTH, TO HAVE A MASS ON THAT DAY HONORING THEIR CHRIST,  A MASS CHRIST, IF YOU WILL. [LAUGHTER] NOW, WE HAVE POKED FUN AT THIS,  SAYING SUCH THINGS AS, THERE IS  NO WAR ON CHRISTMAS OR YOU'RE [BLEEPED] CRAZY. [LAUGHTER] CLASSIC WIT. THAT WAS BEFORE I REALIZED WHAT  THESE POOR FOLKS HAVE BEEN GOING  THROUGH.
THIS IS THE THING ABOUT  ATHEISTS, THEY BULLY OTHER  RELIGIONS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT THEIR  HANDS IN MY RELIGION.
IT'S ABOUT BEING INTOLERANT  TO THE NATURE OF TRADITION IN  THIS COUNTRY. THIS ENDS UP BEING ABOUT  BULLIES.
THEY'RE BEING BULLIES. WHAT ARE CHRISTIANS SUPPOSED TO  DO? TURN THE OTHER CHEEK. OH, OH, NO, WRONG JESUS, MY  FRIEND.
THERE IS A PROBLEM IN AMERICA  WITH THE CHRISTIAN FORCES BEING  WEAK.
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M TELLING YOU, BILL, WIMPY  PASTORS PRODUCE WIMPY  CHRISTIANS.
THEY SEE JESUS AS THIS LITTLE  WIMPY GUY WHO WALKED AROUND  PLUCKING DAISES AND EATING  BIRDSEED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: PLUCKING DAISES AND  EATING BIRDSEED? I THINK YOU'RE THINKING OF  RUSSELL BRAND. IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE. TO THINK OF HIM. NO, THE TRUTH IS I THINK EVEN  MOST NON-CHRISTENS DON'T  PARTICULARLY CARE THAT FOR ABOUT 10% OF EVERY YEAR THE PUBLIC  SPHERE IS DOMINATED BY THIS ONE  PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION IN THE SAME WAY CHRISTIAN DON'T  CARE THAT PEOPLE SAY HAPPY  HOLIDAYS AND SEASONS GREETINGS BECAUSE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW  THE RELIGION OF THE PERSON  YOU'RE GREETING. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND THEY SAY  BACK TO YOU [INAUDIBLE]. SO YOU DON'T KNOW. SO WHAT ARE THESE ATHEIST  BULLIES WANT? I'M ASSUMING A DICTATORSHIP OF  GODLESSNESS.
WE'RE STOPPING THE GOVERNMENT  FROM PREFERRING ONE RELIGION  OVER ANOTHER.
WE DEMAND EQUALITY FROM THE  GOVERNMENT AND IT'S OUR  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. YOU SHOULD BE DEMANDING IT ALONG  WITH ME.
Jon: YES! WE SHOULD BECAUSE YOU ARE  PERHAPS TECHNICALLY CORRECT,  ALTHOUGH I'M STILL NOT SURE HOW YOUR LOCAL MANGER SCENE  ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IS GOING TO  GET YOU TO THAT GOAL. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THAT  GODLESS MAN IS RIGHT. MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD  FORCE COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE  ALL RELIGIONS ARE GIVEN EXACTLY, EXACTLY EQUAL TREATMENT, EVEN  LUTHERANS. PERHAPS AS I SETLE INTO MY  NORMAL MID-SHOW NAP, I CAN  PONDER WHAT A WONDERFUL, EQUITABLE WORLD THAT WOULD BE. [SNORING] [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]:  JON, JON!
Jon: WHO ARE YOU? [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: I'M  THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST.
Jon: WHY ARE YOU DRESSED AS  A KINKY ZOMBIE?
YOUR GHOST FORM IS ALWAYS  WEARING WHAT YOU DIE IN.
Jon: DID YOU DIE FROM  AUTOEROTIC ASPHYXIATION? IS THAT HOW...
NO, JON, I WAS HIT BY A BUS. OKAY. I WAS ON MY WAY TO A... YES. OKAY. I WAS... [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: BUT  IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT YOUR PAST. TAKE MY HAND, JON STEWART. JON JON WE WILL FLY. [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: WE  WILL FLY, FLY, FLY, JON.
Jon: FLY. [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]:  FLY, FLY.
Jon: THIS FEELS A LOT LIKE  WALKING. WHERE ARE WE? THIS IS GOING TO BE EXCITING. OH, MY GOD, THAT'S MY OLD MIDDLE  SCHOOL. [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]:  THAT'S RIGHT, JON STEWART,  BEHOLD.
I HAVE A MILLENNIUM FALCON  FOR CHRISTMAS.
I GOT AN ELECTRIC GUITAR. I GOT A NEW BIKE.
HEY, JON, WHAT DID YOU GET  FOR HANUKKAH?
I GOT A POMEGRANATE.
A WHAT?
A POMEGRANATE. IT'S A FRUIT. YOU EAT THE SEEDS.
WHAT KIND OF DWEEB EATS  SEEDS?
IT WAS THE SECOND NIGHT. WE ALWAYS GET FRUIT. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]:  GOOD TIMES.
Jon: NO, NOT GOOD TIMES. EVERYBODY MADE FUN OF ME BECAUSE  I BROUGHT FRUIT IN.
IT HAD A LOT OF VITAMIN K.
Jon: WHO ARE YOU?
SERIOUSLY? HOW LONG HAVE I WORKED HERE?
Jon: NEW YORK I MEAN, IN  THE BIT, WHO ARE YOU? [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: I  AM THE ALTERNATE GHOST OF  CHRISTMAS PAST. WHAT IF YOU HAD YOUR WISH AND  BEING A JEW AT CHRISTMAS WASN'T  WEIRD AND ALL RELIGIONS WERE TREATED THE SAME.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW, IT  SOUNDS GREAT.
THESE GIFTS ARE GREAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE EVEN  BETTER?
5,000-YEAR TRADITION  CONNECTING ME TO MY ANCESTORS.
THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANTED  FOR CHRISTMAS.
HEY, JON.
AFTER SCHOOL CAN WE COME OVER  YOUR HOUSE AND HELP YOU LIGHT  THE MENORAH?
IT'S A PRETTY MEANINGFUL  TRADITION. OKAY. YOU CAN COME.
[CHEERING]
WE'LL HAVE DREIDELS AND  HYPOALLERGENIC LAT CAS.
JON, DO YOU SEE HOW POPULAR  YOU COULD HAVE BEEN. IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU WANTED?
Jon: YES. AND THEY'RE ALL HAVING  POMEGRANATES.
BUT JON, YOUR SUFFERING  BUILDS CHARACTER. THINK OF ALL THE SURVIVOR SKILLS  YOU DEVELOPED AS A PUT-UPON  MINORITY?
Jon: LIKE WHAT?
LOW SELF-ESTEEM,  SELF-LOATHING, THE INABILITY TO  CONNECT EMOTIONALLY TO YOUR FELLOW MAN. DID YOU MENTION SELF-LOATHING.
Jon: SURE, SURE.
YOU WENT ON TO SUCCEED IN THE  ONE FIELD THAT REWARDS THOSE  QUALITIES.
Jon: COMEDY.
BINGO!
Jon: BEING A SAD, ISOLATED  JEWISH KID WAS THE BEST THING  THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I CAN'T BELIEVE... [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: NOT  SO FAST.
THAT'S RIGHT. DEAL WITH IT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: I  AM THE GHOST...
Jon: WHAT KIND OF OLD-TIME  GHOST CARRIES A SMARTPHONE?
IT'S A BLACKBERRY, JON, THIS  THING IS ANCIENT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. [SPEAKING IN A GHOST VOICE]: I'M  THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT  IF THAT POPULAR BOY GREW UP IN YOUR PLACE. BEHOLD.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. I COULD HAVE BEEN...
THAT'S RIGHT, AMERICA'S THIRD  JEWISH PRESIDENT. UH-HUH. AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
MR. PRESIDENT, SIGNING THIS  BILL WILL END POVERTY IN THE  UNITED STATES.
Jon: END POVERTY IN THE  UNITED STATES. WELL, I'LL DO IT, BUT I'LL MAKE  IT QUICK BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW,  I'VE GOT A SUPER BOWL TO WIN. AMERICA VERSUS AL QAEDA, AND I'M  THE QUARTERBACK. I COULD HAVE BEEN A PRESIDENT  QUARTERBACK?
YEP. WHAT ELSE WERE YOU GOING TO DO  WHEN YOU QUIT THE E STREET BAND.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEPED]. OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I'M SO SERIOUS.
Jon: I COULD HAVE BEEN  PRESIDENT.
NOT BAD FOR A 5'6" KID FROM  CENTRAL JERSEY.
Jon: WAIT, SAY THAT AGAIN.
NOT BAD FROM A FOOTE SIX KID  FROM CENTRAL JERSEY.
Jon: I'M NOT 5'6", I'M  NINTH FOOF SEVEN.
NOT IN THIS WORLD YOU'RE NOT.
I'M GLAD TO BE A JEW AT  CHRISTMAS. I'M GLAD TO BE A JEW AT  CHRISTMAS. I'M GLAD TO BE -- I JUSTED THAT  CRAZIEST DREAM. AND IT TAUGHT ME THAT CHRISTMAS  BELONGS TO ALL OF US BECAUSE ALL  OF US CAN FIND SOMETHING IN IT TO BE ANGRY ABOUT. YOU THERE, BOY?
YES, SIR.
Jon: WHAT DAY IS IT?
TODAY? WHY, BIT CHRISTMAS DAY, SIR.
Jon: THEN IT'S NOT TOO  LATE. HERE, TAKE THIS. TAKE THIS COIN.
I WILL. THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER] HOW DID YOU EVER BECOME  QUARTERBACK?
Jon: HOW DID I EVER BECOME  QUARTERBACK PRESIDENT?
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE, SIR,  LOVELY COIN.
Jon: TAKE THIS AND GO BUY  ME THE BIGGEST PEKING CUT IN ALL  OF CHINA TOWN.
THAT I WILL, SIR, THAT I  WILL.
Jon: THEN YOU AND ME ARE  HAVING CHINESE FOOD AND GOING TO  THE MOTHER [BLEEPED] MOVIES.
REALLY?
Jon: YEAH.
QUICK QUESTION, SIR. MAY WE GO SEE "JACK REACHER,"  SIR?
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
OLD MAN STEWART.
Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE THE  BEST CHRISTMAS FOR A JEW, EVER.
