FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU. MY GUEST TONIGHT, TRACY DROZ TRAGOS, SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DOCUMENTARY "RICH HILL," WHICH IS, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WORK. IT'S VERY POWERFUL. YOU SHOULD SEE IT. OBVIOUSLY NOT RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] DO IT IN A HALF HOUR. BUT FIRST, THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE GENERALLY TO THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRESTIGE SLOT FOR POLITICIANS WHO WISH TO DESTROY THEIR OWN PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS. [LAUGHTER] FROM RISING STAR LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL TO MITCH DANIELS'S DISQUALIFYING HAUNTED HOUSE APPARITION IMPRESSION TO MARCO RUBIO'S WHY DID I EAT THE SILICA GEL DESICCANT I FOUND IN MY SUIT POCKET? I'M SO THIRSTY! IT'S CLEARLY MARKED DO NOT EAT. NOT EVERYONE FACES SUCH IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION. VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOB MCDONNELL'S STATE OF THE UNION REBUTTAL WAS WELL RECEIVED AND WELL DELIVERED, BUT DON'T THINK THAT WILL ALLOW HIM TO ESCAPE THE CURSE. [MANIACAL LAUGHING]
THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AND HIS WIFE ON TRIAL FOR CORRUPTION.
FOR INFLUENCE PEDDLING. EXCHANGING $165,000 IN GIFTS FOR POLITICAL FAVORS.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. VIRGINIA IS FOR LOVERS OF MONEY. BUT YOU KNOW COLD HARD CASH CAN'T HOLD YOU AT NIGHT, AND A BLANK CHECK CAN'T WIPE AWAY YOUR TEARS. YOU CAN'T LAY A SACAGAWEA COIN ON A BED OF ROSE PEDALS AND SOFTLY -- I'M SORRY. I'M WORKING ON OUR ROMANCE NOVEL. IT'S IN THE SUBGENRE OF THE PARANORMAL SUBGENRE OF THE TEEN ROMANCE NOVEL SUBGENRE. THE FEDS SAY MCDONNELL AND HIS WIFE WERE SHOWERED WITH GIFTS FROM MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN JOHNNIE WILLIAMS IN EXCHANGE FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT. BUT THAT'S JUST ONE SIDE OF THE STORY. WHAT DOES MILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN JOHNNIE WILLIAMS SAY?
WILLIAMS SAYS HE SHOWERED FORMER VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BOB MCDONNELL AND HIS WIFE WITH GIFTS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR HELP PROMOTING THE TOBACCO-BASED PILL HE'D INVENTED AND WAS PITCHING AS A WONDER DRUG OF SORTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GUESS THERE IS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE STORY. BY THE WAY, THE WONDER DRUG THAT HE WAS PITCHING IS CALLED ANATABOLIC OR ANTABLOC. I'M SORRY. AND YOU MAY BE WONDERING HOW SOMEONE COULD TURN A TOBACCO-BASED PILL INTO A WONDER DRUG, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS, SEEING AS MOST TOBACCO-BASED THINGS ARE, ARE WONDER CARCINOGENS. YOU'RE GOING TO KICK YOURSELF FOR NOT THINKING OF THIS FIRST. HE NUKED THE TOBACCO IN 200 WAL-MART MICROWAVES. [LAUGHTER] TIRED OF FEELING BAD? TRY SOME OF OUR HIGHLY IRRADIATED CIGARETTE PILLS. [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY IT TURNS OUT WHEN YOU PUT TWO TERRIBLE THINGS TOGETHER, IT MAKES SOMETHING GREAT. GONORRHEA IS TERRIBLE, BUT WHEN YOU MIX IT IN A CROCK POT WITH DOG VOMIT, IT TRANSFORMS INTO A HEALTHY PART OF ANY CHILD'S BREAKFAST. MMM. MMM. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THAT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE COUNT DRIPULA. ALL RIGHT. SO THE GOVERNOR AND HIS WIFE ACCEPTED A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF GIFTS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF THEY ACTUALLY TRIED TO PROMOTE THIS CRAZY DRUG.
THE GOVERNOR SET UP MEETINGS FOR MR. WILLIAMS WITH TOP STATE OFFICIALS. THE GOVERNOR AND FIRST LADY HOSTED AN EVENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. ALSO APPEARED TO SHOW SOME INTEREST IN ENCOURAGING PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO CONDUCT CLINICAL STUDIES OF A CHEMICAL FOUND IN THE SUPPLEMENT.
Jon: AND, OF COURSE, GOVERNOR MCDONNELL PERSONALLY PUSHED THROUGH THE BILL CHANGING VIRGINIA'S STATE FOOD TO MARLBORO HOT POCKETS. SOME SOLID EXAMPLES OF AN APPARENT QUID PRO QUO. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING WEIRDER?
ON THE SAME DAY MCDONNELL ENDORSED MITT ROMNEY FOR PRESIDENT, MAUREEN McDONNELL ALLEGEDLY PITCHED ROMNEY'S WIFE ANN, CLAIMING WILLIAM'S PRODUCT COULD POTENTIALLY CURE HER MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: K, THAT... THAT'S [BLEEPED] UP. HOW DO THOSE TWO LIVE WITH THEMSELVES? WELL, I GUESS IT'S EASY THANKS TO FORGETULEX, FROM THE MAKERS OF ANTABLOC, THE HERBAL SUPPLEMENT GUARANTEED TO WIPE OUT THE MEMORY OF A TIME YOU TRIVIALIZED A WOMAN'S DIBILITATING AND INCURABLE DISEASE SO THAT A WHACKED OUT SUPPLEMENT HUCKSTER WOULD BUY YOU A WATCH. FORGETULEX, IT'S MADE OF CRUSHED UP HEROIN NEEDLES AND BEDBUGS. SO THIS SEEMS LIKE AN OPEN-AND-SHUT AWFUL THING. WHAT DO THE MCDONNELLS HAVE TO SAY IN THEIR DEFENSE?
ATTORNEYS FOR THE MCDONNELLS SAY THE COUPLE IS INNOCENT. THAT THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CONSPIRING TO ABUSE THE OFFICE BECAUSE THEIR MARRIAGE HAD BROKEN DOWN AND THEY WERE BARELY ON SPEAKING TERMS.
Jon: WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HAPPILY MARRIED TO BE CORRUPT, ALTHOUGH IT HELPS, LIKE INFAMOUSLY CORRUPT ITALIAN PM SILVIO BERLUSCONI AND HIS WIFE OF 20 YEARS, A LADY-SHAPED PILE OF COCAINE AND GOLD. OH, OH, THAT'S SOME GOOD BUNGA BUNGA. WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT MCDONNELL'S MARRIAGE WAS EVEN SOUR?
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY THE STATE'S FIRST LADY HAD A CRUSH ON JOHNNIE WILLIAMS.
JURORS SAW 1,200 PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN MAUREEN AND WILLIAMS. ON THE DAY OF THE 2011 VIRGINIA EARTHQUAKE, SHE TEXTED HIM, "I JUST FELT THE EARTH MOVE, AND I WASN'T HAVING SEX."
Jon: ALL CAPITALS. SO WAS THE FIRST LADY OF VIRGINIA HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH BUSINESSMAN JOHNNIE WILLIAMS?
JOHNNIE WILLIAMS SAID THAT THERE WAS NO ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIM AND MAUREEN MCDONNELL. HE SAID, "I DIDN'T KNOW SHE EVEN HAD ANY INTEREST IN ME UNTIL THIS PAST WEEK."
Jon: WHAT, ARE THEY IN [BLEEPED] FOURTH GRADE? WHAT IS THIS? WILLIAMS DIDN'T PICK UP ON THE SIGNALS, I GUESS BECAUSE HE'S A CRAZY-EYED INVENTOR, GOT HIS HEAD FILLED WITH SO MANY IDEAS DOESN'T KNOW WHEN THE LADIES ARE TRYING TO HIT HIM UP. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED ME. I WAS JUST THINKING IF I PUT MY FARTS INTO A GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL, MAYBE I CAN CURE LUPUS. I DON'T KNOW. I'M AN INVENTOR! [LAUGHTER] PLEASE DON'T TRY DOING THAT AT HOME. [LAUGHTER] WHY WOULD MRS. MCDONNELL LIE ABOUT THIS?
MAUREEN MCDONNELL'S CHIEF OF STAFF TOLD F.B.I. INVESTIGATORS MAUREEN MCDONNELL WAS "A NUT BAG." [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SOMEONE'S NOT GETTING A REFERENCE LETTER. HERE'S WHAT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT, WHY IS "NUT BAG" A TERM FOR CRAZY? YOU GOT TO CARRY YOUR NUTS IN SOMETHING, AND A BAG SEEMS AS SENSIBLE A CONVEYANCE OBJECT AS ANYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE CRAZY? EATING NUTS OUT OF A DIAPER, BUT YOU DON'T HEAR PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT CRAZY PEOPLE, THAT GUY'S NUT DIAPER. APPARENTLY I'M ALONE. EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE IS LIKE, I EAT NUTS OUT OF A DIAPER. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE POINT IS THIS: CLEARLY THE REAL VICTIM HERE IS BOB McDONNELL BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING HE CARES ABOUT IS FAMILY VALUES.
34-YEAR-OLD McDONNELL WROTE HIS MASTERS THESIS ON FAMILY VALUES. HE SUGGESTED WORKING WOMEN AND FEMINISTS WERE "DETRIMENTAL TO THE FAMILY."
WE BELIEVE IN THE SANCTITY OF LIFE AND FAMILY AND MARRIAGE. I THINK THESE ISSUES OF LIFE AND FAMILY AND MARRIAGE KIND OF DEFINE WHO YOU ARE AS A PEOPLE.
Jon: WOW, SO I GUESS BY YOUR OWN DEFINITION YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON. DON'T WORRY, THERE'S A CURE, LESSADOUCHE. [LAUGHTER] IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DENOUNCING YOUR OWN MARRIAGE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE THE MASSIVE CORRUPTION CHARGES FILED AGAINST YOU, YOU MAY HAVE NATURAL ETHICS DEFICIENCY. TREATED WITH LESSADOUCHE, IT'S MADE WITH ASBESTOS AND YOUR PARENTS' DIVORCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
