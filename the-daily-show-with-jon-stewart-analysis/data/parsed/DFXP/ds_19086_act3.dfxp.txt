Jon: WELCOME BACK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY GUEST TONIGHT LEGENDARY FOOTBALLER WON THREE WORLD CUPS DURING HIS PROFESSIONAL CAREER IS THE ALL-TIME LEADING GOAL SCORER IN SOCCER HISTORY. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED WHY SOCCER MATTERS. HERE IS A LITTLE TASTE, JUST A SMALL TASTE, OF WHAT MADE HIM THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME. ♪  ♪  ♪  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WOW. PLEASE WELCOME PELE. SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S SUCH AN HONOR FOR ME TO HAVE YOU HERE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HOW GREAT YOU WERE AS A PLAYER BUT HOW YOU PLAYED THE GAME WITH SUCH TENACITY, SUCH SKILL BUT ALWAYS WITH SUCH HEART. I ADMIRE THAT GREATLY.
THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU KNOW, JON, SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHY BECAUSE JUST GOD KNOW WHY YOU DO SOME THINGS. YOU KNOW?
Jon: YEAH.
MY FATHER WAS A SOCCER PLAYER. PLAYED PROFESSIONAL.
Jon: OH, HE DID PLAY PROFESSIONAL?
YEAH, MY FATHER WAS A PROFESSIONAL IN STATE OF MINAS GERAIS WHERE I WAS BORN AND THEN THEY WENT TO STATE OF SAO PAOLO AND PLAY AT SAO PAOLO.
Jon: CROWDED.
BAURU IS NOW NEXT TO SAO PAOLO CAPITAL AND THEN THERE I START. MY FATHER STOP I START. AND THAT'S I JUST WANT TO BE -- I SAY OH, MY GOD ONE DAY I GONNA BE LIKE MY FATHER.
Jon: IT'S BEAUTIFUL. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: AND WHEN YOU STARTED, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT YOU OVERCOME TO DO THIS. YOU GROW UP VERY LITTLE MONEY. YOU USE FOR A SOCCER BALL, A SOCK STUFFED WITH NEWSPAPER OR AN OLD FRUIT, SOMETHING.
GRAPEFRUIT.
Jon: THAT'S HOW THEY PLAY ON THE DIRT. AND YOU -- WERE YOU ALWAYS -- DID YOUR SKILLS COME TO YOU JUST SO NATURALLY? WERE YOU ALWAYS EVEN AS A YOUNGER PLAYER ABLE TO PLAY WITH THE BIGGER KIDS?
AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FACILITY WE HAVE TODAY. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH BALLS, SHOES, AT THAT TIME --
Jon: YEAH.
YEAH.
Jon: DO YOU KNOW WHY IN MANY REASONS WHY SOCCER NOW HAS ALL OF THIS. DO YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THE BASE I THINK --
Jon: BECAUSE OF YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IN 1950 BRAZIL HOSTS THE WORLD CUP. YOU ARE NOT ON THE NATIONAL TEAM YET. HOW OLD ARE YOU IN 1950?
FOR THE NEW GENERATION, SOMEONE KNOW ABOUT BUT FOR THE NEW GENERATION. WE USED TO LOOK -- MY FATHER DIDN'T PLAY. BECAUSE THERE WAS A GOOD TEAM IN BAURU. IN THE WORLD CUP IN 1950 THEY SAID OKAY THE TEAM IS GOING TO RELAX AND THEN GONNA INVITE MY FRIENDS  --  SOME FRIENDS, SOME PLAYERS TO GO TO MY HOUSE, TO LISTEN. AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE A TV. YEAH, I WAS EIGHT TO NINE YEARS OLD.
Jon: WOW.
AND THEN I WAS PLAYING WITH MY FRIENDS THERE, THE SON OF THE OTHER PLAYERS EXERCISE BECAUSE WORLD CUP IN BRAZIL. BRAZIL WAS THE BEST TEAM AT THAT TIME. BUT IF YOU STAY FAR AWAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE IT ON TV. THEN I COME I SAW SILENCE. I CAME INSIDE OF MY HOUSE. MY FATHER AND THE OTHER PLAYERS WAS SO SAD. AND MY FATHER WAS CRYING. BUT FIRST TIME I SAW MY FATHER CRY. I SAY WHY YOU CRY? BECAUSE MY FATHER USED TO SAY, MEN DON'T CRY. YOU REMEMBER THAT. SUPPOSED TO BE MACHO MAN, MACHO MAN. I SAID WHY YOU CRY? HE SAID BRAZIL LOST THE WORLD CUP. HE WAS SO DEPRESSED I SAID I GONNA WON WORLD CUP FOR YOU, NO WORRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HERE IS MY HOPE. HERE IS MY HOPE FOR THE WORLD CUP. YOU KNOW I LOVE THE UNITED STATES SOCCER TEAM. BUT THEY ARE IN THE GROUP OF DEATH. IF WE GET OUT THE QUARTERS I CAN'T -- WE'RE WITH GHANA, PORTUGAL, GERMANY. IT WILL BE NICE. THEY'LL A GOOD TRIP. IT WILL BE FINE. SO HERE IS MY HOPE. BRAZIL IN THE FINAL AGAINST WHO DID THEY LOSE TO IN 1950, URUGUAY? SO THEY GO AGAINST URUGUAY IN THE FINAL, IT'S REVENGE FOR 1950. WHO SCORES THE WINNING GOAL? THE HAND OF PELE.
YOU CAN SAY THE HAND OF GOD.
Jon: YEAH!
LISTEN, I GONNA JUST TAKE ONE TIME.
Jon: SURE, SURE.
AS WE TALK ABOUT THE WORLD CUP.
Jon: YES, YES.
I PLAY FOUR WORLD CUP.
Jon: YES.
THE FIRST ONE WAS 17 YEARS OLD IN SWEDEN. FORTUNATELY BRAZIL WON THE TOURNAMENT.
Jon: YOU WERE VOTED SECOND BEST PLAYER IN THE ENTIRE TOURNAMENT AND BEST YOUNG PLAYER.
SECOND ONE BRAZIL WON IN CHILE. IN ENGLAND 1966. BRAZIL THREE WORLD CUPS CAME IN WITH A BIG TEAM AND LOST WORLD CUP. I GOT INJURY.
Jon: BUT THEY REALLY KICKED YOU IN THAT ONE. THEY WERE VERY VICIOUS TO YOU. I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT ONE.
AND THEN THAT SUPPOSE -- I WAS DEPRESSED. I SAID THIS WILL BE MY LAST WORLD CUP. BUT THEN 70 I WAS IN GOOD SHAPE. I SAY, OKAY. I GONNA PLAY. GOD GAVE IT TO ME THE WORLD CUP.
Jon: YEAH.
AND THEN I BRING SOMETHING FROM 70 FOR YOU.
Jon: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. FOR GOD SAKES, NO. AWWWWW! OH, WOW. OLE, OLE -- MY FRIEND. GOD BLESS. THANK YOU, MY FRIEND, SO MUCH SO LOVELY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, "WHY SOCCER MATTERS" IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THE GREAT PELE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
