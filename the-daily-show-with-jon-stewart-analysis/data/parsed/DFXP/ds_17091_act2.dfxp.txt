(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO YOU REMEMBER TEN YEARS AGO, WE HAD REALLY ONLY THREE COUNTRIES TO WORRY B  IRAN, NORTH CORE CA AND IRAQ. THE ACCESS OF EVIL TS WITH A PHRASE THAT TESTED BETTER ON FOCUS GROUPS THAN HAT TRICK  OF MEANY SO WE KNOCKED OFF IRAQ. HOW IS THE REST OF THE AXIS HOLDING UP. LET'S START WITH NORTH KOREA. THE BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP KNOWN FOR ITS RUTHLESS PRECISION, UTTER INTOLERANCE FOR FAILURE, AND UNIQUE  ABILITY TO STRETCH MEATLESS MONDAY OUT FOR 60 YEARS. (LAUGHTER) THEY'VE BEEN MAKING SO MANY BELLIGERENT NOISE O BAMA HIMSELF VISITED THE FAMED  DEMILITARIZED ZONE LAST MONTH DISGUISED AS A BIRD-WATCHER JUST TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEM. CONDITION YOU GIVE HIM MORE MACHO GLASS. WHAT HE IS WATCHING?
WHAT YOU HAVE GOT THERE. NO, NO, WRONG COUNTRY, MR. PRESIDENT, THAT'S-- THAT'S, YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK NORTH, LOOK NORTH. THAT'S-- WHAT-- NO, THAT'S A WOMAN FROM THE '50s. SHE'S GETTING ATTACKED, I CAN'T-- MR. PRESIDENT, LOOK THE OTHER WAY. LOOK THE-- YES, THAT -- WHAT? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: JUST CLEANING THE OFFICE. (LAUGHTER) MODESTLY DRESSED. SO WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS WATCHING ME, NORTH KOREA TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO  LAUNCH A LONG-RANGE MISSILE TEST. SOUNDS PRETTY SCARY. HOW DID IT GO.
THE LAUNCH FAILED OVER THE OCEAN. A HUGE EMBARRASSMENT FOR NORTH KOREA IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD.
THERE WAS AN UNPIT GATED DISASTER.
A WEAPON OF MASS DYSFUNCTION.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE HEAD OF NORTH KOREA'S SPACE AGENCY RIGHT NOW.
YOU CAN'T UNDER STATE WHAT AN EMBARRASS AM THIS IS.
THE NORTH KOREAN ROCKET THAT EVERYONE WAS WORRIED ABOUT, WELL, FOR NOW AT  LEAST YOU CAN STOP WORRYING IT IS NO SPUTNIK T IS MORE LIKE KAPUT ANYTHING, A DUD.
Jon: SPUTNIK CAPUT NICK. WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE YOU DR. JACK SPADOSKY, IF IT CARRIED A MIXED BREED DOG  INTO SPACE, IT WOULD BE MULTINIK. (LAUGHTER) IF THE ROCKET ENLISTED IN THE ARMY, IT WOULD BE CREW CREWCUTNIK. (LAUGHTER) IF THE MISSILE HAD TO SLINK HOME AT 8 A.M. IN THE SAME CLOTHES IT WORE THE NIGHT  BEFORE, IT WOULD BE SLUTNIK. I COULD DO THIS ALL NIGHT. (APPLAUSE) I HAVE 8,000 OF THESE. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) YOU MAY LEAVE WHEN I GET TO JABBATHEHUTNIK. IT'S ONE THING TO LOSE A ROCKET. NORTH KOREA DOES THAT ALL THE TIME. BUT TO DO IT ON THE DAY THAT THEY LOST IT OF ALL DAYS.
THIS WAS MEANT TO BE THE PINNACLE OF THE MASSIVE CELEBRATION PLANNED FOR THE  CENTENARY OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDING FATHER OF THE COUNTRY, KIM IL-SUNG.
Jon: NICE JOB THERE, NEW GUY, NEW KIM. NOT ONLY DID YOU BLOW YOUR COUNTRY'S ENTIRE ANNUAL FOOD BUDGET ON A [BLEEP] ROCKET, YOU RUINED YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BIRTH DATE. THE ONLY WAY KIM JUNGUN COULD HAVE MADE ANY WORSE OF THIS DAY IS IF HE JUST  SHOWED UP FOR THE CEREMONY WITH A NOSE PIERCING AND A SOUTH KOREAN BOYFRIEND. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GRANDPA. CAN I GO NOW. LONG-SU AND I HAVE TICKETS TO JERSEY BOYS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S IT, NORTH KOREA. YOU -- ARE OUT OF-- I JUST PULLED A FINGER LIGAMENT. ARE YOU OUT OF THE AXIS OF EVIL, NORTH KOREA. WHICH MEANS THERE IS A SLOT OPEN. PERHAPS WE COULD PUT AFGHANISTAN IN THERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE ANYWAY.
IN AFGHANISTAN A MIDLEVEL TALIBAN COMMANDER REPORTEDLY TURNED HIMSELF IN TO AFGHAN POLICE.
Jon: THAT'S GOOD NEWS. WHAT CAUSED THE COMMANDER TO TURN HIMSELF IN, WAS IT PRESSURE FROM THE AFGHAN  ARMY, A SENSE THAT THE INSURGENCY WAS WANING WA, WAS IT.
THE MIDLEVEL TALIBAN COMMANDER REPORTEDLY TURNED HIMSELF INTO AFGHAN POLICE, THEN DEMANDED THEY PAY HIM THE $100 REWARD FOR HIS CAPTURE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU MEAN TO TELL ME WE SPENT 10 YEARS AND $550 TRYING TO ROUTE THE TALIBAN  AND ALL WE FEED WAD 12 HOURS WORTH OF POST-IT BOARD AN A SHARPIE? SON OF A BITCH! NOW OF COURSE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT-- IS NOT THE QUICKEST DETONATER IN  THE BOX, THAT ERODE THE SHORT GOAT TO THE MED RASSA F YOU KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.
THE UCHLTS IS OFFICIAL TALLS THE SUSPECTED IN SURGE ENT, THE TALIBAN EQUIVALENT  OF THE BURGLARS IN HOME ALONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BECAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT? OR BECAUSE WE LOVED HIM IN THE '90s? YES, SEE, HANG ON. IF HE IS THE BURGLAR, WHAT DOES THAT MAKE US?
AAAAHHHHHH!
Jon: I'LL TAKE THAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
