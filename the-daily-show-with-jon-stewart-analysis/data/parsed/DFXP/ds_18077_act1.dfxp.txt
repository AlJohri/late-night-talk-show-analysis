FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT OUR GUEST  TONIGHT DENISE KIERNAN SHE'S  WRITTEN A BOOK BEGUN AN UNTOLD STORY ABOUT THE WOMEN INVOLVED  IN THIS TOWN IN OAK RIDGE,  TENNESSEE IN THE MANHATTAN  PROJECT. A FASCINATED BOOK. DOWN AT THE UNITED STATES  SUPREME COURT WHERE AMERICA'S  TOP NINE JUSTICES SPENT TWO FULL DAYS ENJOYING GAY ORAL. [LAUGHTER] ARGUMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY WERE HEARING ORAL  ARGUMENTS -- [LAUGHTER] -- ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF  THE FEDERAL DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE  ACT AND CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSITION 8 BAN ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE MAIN  ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE GAY  MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE A ELEMENT OF MORAL OUTRAGE IT'S ADAM AND EVE,  NOT ADAM STEVE. GOD WOULD WANT TO YOU MAKE LOVE  SOMETHING TORN FROM YOUR OWN RIB  CAGE. IT'S NOT LIKE ADAM HAD A LOT OF  OPTIONS. IT WAS EITHER HER OR THE SNAKE. WITH THE SNAKE YOU DON'T EVEN  KNOW -- ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR GAY  MARRIAGE OPPONENTS, THE BROAD  MORAL ARGUMENT HAD BEEN DEEMED JUST TEN YEARS EARLIER BY THIS  COURT TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL  SINCE TO THE LANDMARK CASE IN TEXAS IN WHICH JUSTICE ANTHONY  KENNEDY WROTE FOR THE MAJORITY  THAT QUOTE WE AS THE NATION CANNOT ABIDE THE BANNING OF BUTT  SEX PURELY ON THE BASIS OF ITS  PUNITIVE YUCKY FACTOR. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I'M  NOT PARAPHASING THIS JUDICIAL  OPINION. THAT IS WHAT HE WROTE. GOOGLE BUTT SEX SUPREME AND I  THINK YOU WILL FIND OUT -- [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THE POINT IS THIS: [LAUGHTER] KENNEDY'S POINT WAS THAT MORAL  DISAPPROVAL IN THE ABSENCE OF  OTHER HARM COULD NOT BE THE SOLE BASIS FOR PROHIBITION GO. TO LITIGATOR MR. PAUL CLEMENT  ARGUED THAT THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT WAS NOT MORALITY BASED WHEN IT WAS SIGNED IN 1996  BUT UNTIL FACT MERELY AN EFFORT  TO UNIFY FEDERAL STANDARDS TO RECOGNIZING MARRIAGE LICENSES. JUST TRYING TO AVOID CONFUSION,  YOU KNOW, IN THE SAME WAY THAT  WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY HAVE INTERSTATE DRIVING AND HUNTING  LIE SOARNSES LAWYERS LIE  SOARNSES HETEROSEXUAL MARRIAGE LICENSES WHICH DIFFERENT STATES  HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS FORM OF I'LL  JUST LET JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN -- I'LL LET HER HANDLE IT.
DO WE REALLY THINK THAT  CONGRESS WAS DOING THIS FOR  UNIFORMITY REASONS? OR DO WE THINK THAT CONGRESS'S  JUDGMENT WAS INFESTED BY THE  FEAR, BY ANIMUS AND SO FORTH?
Jon: FASCINATING. MR. CLEMENT?
THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE  BUT I WANT TO GET AROUND TO THE  ANIMUS POINT. BUT THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE  IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT CONGRESS  DOING SOMETHING THAT IS UNUSUAL, THEY DEVIATED FROM IT IN THE  PAST.
Jon: I'M GOING TO CUT YOU  OFF RIGHT THERE MY FRIEND. BEAUTIFUL SINCE YOU ARE ONLY  GOING TO GET AROUND TO THE  ANIMUS POINT EVENTUALLY -- [LAUGHTER] -- PERHAPS WE COULD GO BACK TO  1996 WITH SOME KIND OF CRAZY  TIME MACHINE AND LISTEN TO SOME OF CONGRESS'S GOOD REASONS FOR  HAVING DOMA. LET ME JUST REITERATE THIS IS  FROM 1996, NOT 1956.
MOST PEOPLE DON'T APPROVE OF  HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT.
IT'S INHERENTLY WRONG AND  HARMFUL TO INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES  AND SOCIETY.
AN ATTACK UPON GOD'S  PRINCIPLES.
THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF OUR  SOCIETY ARE ENDANGERED OF BEING  BURNED. THE FAMILY UNIT IS THE  FOUNDATION OF SOCIETY.
Jon: WE CANNOT ABIDE  ANYTHING LICKING AT THE  FOUNDATION OF OUR UNITS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE ALLOW THE LICKING OF OUR  UNITS -- [LAUGHTER] -- STRONGLY SLIDE UP AND DOWN  THE PILLARS OF OUR SOCIETY. [ LAUGHTER ] ULTIMATELY GOBBLING OUR MORALITY  DOWN TO THE HILT, GAGGING ON  OUR -- WAIT -- WHAT RE WITH TALKING ABOUT AGAIN? [LAUGHTER] UNLESS YOU BELIEVE WE ARE CHERRY  PICKING FLOOR DEBATES LOWLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTING THE MORALITY ARGUMENTS WE'LL HAVE JUSTICE  KAGAN READ FROM THE SUMMARY OF  DELIBERATION IN 1996 TO SEE IF THE WRITERS OF DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT DID SO WITH MORAL  INTENT.
I'M GOING TO QUOTE FROM THE  HOUSE REPORT HERE IS THAT  CONGRESS DECIDED TO REFLECT AND HONOR A COLLECTIVE MORAL  JUDGMENT AND TO EXPRESS MORAL  DISAPPROVAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY. IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN 1996?
DOES THE HOUSE REPORT SAY  THAT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DOES IT -- IS THAT  WHAT IT SAYS? IF IT PLEASES THE COURT, I'D  LIKE TO WIPE MY BROW COMICALLY  NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] OOOOH, PERHAPS APPROACH THE  BENCH -- [LAUGHTER] BUT WITH MORAL ARGUMENTS NO  LONGER AVAILABILITY TO OPPONENTS  OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WHAT IS LEFT FOR THE CONSERVATIVES TO  ARGUE? LET'S LET JUSTICE SCALIA TAKE A  CRACK AT IT.
IF YOU REDEFINE MARRIAGE TO  SAME SEX COUPLES YOU MUST PERMIT  ADOPTION BY SAME SEX COUPLES.
Jon: EVERYTHING SOUNDS SO  FAR. THIS SAY DISAGREEMENT AMONG  SOCIOLOGISTS AS TO WHAT THE  CONSEQUENCES OF RAISING A CHILD IN THE SEX OF A -- IN A SINGLE  SEX FAMILY WHETHER IT'S HARMFUL  TO THE CHILD OR NOT.
Jon: MAY I APPROACH THE  GRINCH, DICK SHALL BENCH, BENCH. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE ISN'T DISAGREEMENT. THE AMERICAN ACAD-PEED ATTICS  SAY THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP WEB  PARENTS SEXUAL OR YENATION OR CHILDREN'S WELL BEING. AND SECOND OF ALL IF THE NEW  STANDARD FOR RECOGNIZING  MARRIAGE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE COUPLE WOULD MAKE GOOD PARENTS,  YOU ANTONIN SCALIA SHOULD GET  CABLE BECAUSE -- IT LOOKS LIKE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE  CONSEQUENCES -- THE CONSEQUENCES  OF HETEROSEXUAL CHILD REARING ARE PRETTY SEVERE AND THOSE ARE  JUST THE HETEROS THAT LET PEOPLE  FILM THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HETEROSEXUALED ARE ALLOWED TO  BE (bleep) PARENTS. WHAT IS THE NEXT ARGUMENT.
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS VERY  NEW. I THINK IT WAS FIRST ADOPTED IN  THE NETHERLANDS IN 2000 SO THERE  ISN'T A LOT OF DATA ABOUT ITS  SUCCESS. YOU WANT US TO STEP IN AND  RENDER A DECISION ON AN  ASSESSMENT OF THIS INSTITUTION NEWER THAN CELL PHONES OR THE  INTERNET? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO WE WANT TO YOU  RENDER A DECISION BASED ON  WHETHER IT'S RIGHT AND FAIR AND JUST UNDER THE CONSTITUTION  HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS  NEWNESS AND WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT  HAPPEN. WHICH BY THE WAY WHAT DO YOU  THINK MIGHT SNAP THAT THEY  DISCOVER LETTING TWO LADIES GET MARRIED WILL RIP OPEN A HOLE IN  THE OZONE LAYER. GAY MARRIAGE WILL CAUSE LESS  NATIONAL HARM THAN CELL PHONES  OR THE INTERNET. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE THING THAT I'M  PRETTY SURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO  DO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU DON'T HAVE TO BETA TEST  RIGHT. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE ONLY BEEN HERE  50 YEARS. LET'S SEE HOW THE NETHERLANDS  DOES WITH THEM BEFORE WE LIFT  THE BEARERS. WHILE THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS ARE  CLEARLY FASCINATING, I WONDER IF  THERE WAS A MORE HUMAN ELEMENT IN ALL THAT THIS COULD DEMYSTIFY  THE ISSUE FOR THE CONSERVATIVE  JUSTICES.
AT THE HEART OF THIS CASE IS  THE STORY OF THESE WOMEN. IT'S A STORY THAT SPANS 40  YEARS. THIS IS HOW LONG EDIE WINCER WAS  WITH HER PARTNER.
WHEN MY BEAUTIFUL SPARKLING  PARTNER DIED FOUR YEARS AGO. I WAS OVER COME WITH GRIEF. I REALIZED THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT WAS TREATING US AS  STRANGERS.
Jon: INCREDIBLY ADORABLE  WOMAN GRIEVING THE LOSS OF HER  SPOUSE IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAY EXCEPT IN THE EYES OF THE LAW. CAN WE JUST MOVE TO JUSTICE? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE NOT. THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT I THINK  THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES WILL  GET HIT HOME WITH.
WHEN SPIRE PASSED AWAY SHE  WAS HIT WITH A $360,000 FEDERAL  ESTATE TAX BILL MONEY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAID IF HE IS SHE  WAS MARRIED TO A MAN.
Jon: (bleep) INJUSTICE  THE RIGHT MAY NOT RECOGNIZE TRUE  LOVE BUT THEY RECOGNIZE THE HEARTBREAK THAT IS DOUBLE  TAXATION.
