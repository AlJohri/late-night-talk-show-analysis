I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH  OR AT ALL. ANYTHING OF THOSE THINGS SHOULD  HAVE SAID TO A NORMAL PERSON  SAYING DON'T DO THIS. WE WERE IN A GROCERY STORE. I HAD NEVER BEEN TO NEW YORK. SOMEONE SAID YOU SHOULD DO  /  STAND UP/  STAND-UP I'M LIKE  PROBABLY. NOW I'D SAY OH, GOD, WHY WOULD I  SAY YES TO THAT? WHAT WOULD MAKE ME SAY YES.
Jon: DID I FEEL RIGHT?
I STILL HAD NOTHING. I WAS LIKE I GUESS I'LL DO THIS.
Jon: SO WONDERFUL. OUR STORIES MIRROR EACH OTHER  EXCEPT FOR THE AUDIENCE  REACTION. THE AUDIENCE I WAS WITH LET ME  KNOW I HAD NO SENSE. I REMEMBER MY FIRST NIGHT ON  STAGE IN THE VILLAGE IN NEW YORK  1:00 IN THE MORNING. HIS FIVE MINUTES OF MATERIAL  BEAUTIFULLY SCRIPTED I GOT  THROUGH TEN SECONDS AND THE GUY WAS LIKE YOU SUCK!
I GOT A LOVE -- I WAS IN A  GOLD PAVE LEATHER CAPE AND HAD A  HUGE WIG ON, HIGH RED. I HAD A SKIRT ON THAT I HAD NO  BUSINESS WEARING. IF IT TAKES TWO OF YOU TO GET IT  ON MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T. I THOUGHT I LOOK A SOME. I WAS ON THE STAGE AND TELLING  BIG LONG CRAZY STORIES AND AND  THE LIGHTS FLASHING. THEY STARTING FLASHING WHEN I  GOT A LITTLE LAUGH. AND I FELT LIKE YOU ARE AMAZING. I WAS LIKE I HAVE THIS. SO EVERY TIME. AND GUYS -- I KNOW HE'S BACK  THERE SWEARING AT ME. AND EVERY TIME I SAW THE LIGHT I  WAS LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] SO I DID LIKE -- GOD KNOWS WHAT  I WAS TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING BECAUSE  THEY FELT BAD FOR ME. AND I GOT OFF AND THEY ASKED ME  TO COME BACK AND SCREAMED AT ME. I THINK YOU ARE AN IDIOT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE ENCOURAGING  ME.
Jon: THAT MAY BE MY FIRST  COMEDY NIGHT STORY. MAN WOULD I HAVE PREFERRED THAT  HAPPENING TO ME. I WAS RIDING IN RIDING IN THE BRONCO AND  IT WAS THREE SECONDS AND IT WAS  LIKE THAT GUY GOT TRAMPLED LOOK TAX I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME BY. THE MOVIE LOOKS HILARIOUS. COME SEE US AGAIN.
