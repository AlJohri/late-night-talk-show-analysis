Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ASTROPHYSICIST. FROM THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE HIDDEN PLANETARIUM HE'S  ALSO THE HOST OF PBS'S NOVA SCIENCE NOW.
AND IF FOOD IS SEPTEMBER AHEAD OF THE ASTRONAUTS IT WILL HAVE TO KEEP FOR FIVE YEARS. YET ONLY SEVEN OF NASA'S 65 THERMAL STABILIZED EDIBLES HAVE THAT KIND OF SHELF LIFE. BUT THE REST END UP LIKE THIS. NOW THIS LOOKS NASTY.
THAT IS VERY NASTY. WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS IS OUR CITRUS FRUIT SALAD. FIVE-YEAR-OLD VERSUS TWO-YEAR-OLD.
SOMETHING HAPPENED BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE YEARS. WHAT?
A LOT OF CHEMISTRY GOING ON.
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME. THIS SPECIAL THAT YOU ARE DOING, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. LET'S FACE FACTS. I ALWAYS ENJOY SEEING YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jon: TOPS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: BECAUSE YOU ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS. WILL WE LIVE FOREVER? WILL WE GO TO MARS? WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG THING? ALL THESE THINGS ARE LAID OUT TO THIS PBS....
INDEED THEY ARE.
Jon: WHAT IS THE QUESTION THAT YOU ANSWER IN THE PBS NOVA SPECIALS THAT YOU WERE  MOST INTERESTED IN? YOU WERE MOST ENTICED BY?
I LIKE THE ONE WE LEAD OFF WITH. HOW DO GET TO MARS? CAN WE GET TO MARS? IS A SHIP AVAILABLE? CAN YOU DO IT? THERE'S STUFF THAT OTHERS DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT LIKE... FIRST YOU HAVE TO WAIT  FOR EARTH AND MARS TO LINE UP SO YOU CAN GET THERE EFFICIENTLY. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO AIM FOR WHERE MARS WILL BE WHEN YOU GET THERE. THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING.
Jon: IF YOU WANT TO GO TO MARS, ISN'T THAT HOW WE WENT TO THE MOON. DIDN'T YOU HAVE TO DO THAT FOR THE MOON AS WELL.
FOR THE MOON YOU COULD COME BACK WHENEVER NEEDED. WHEN YOU GET TO MARS, STUFF IS OUT OF ALIGNMENTS, YOU HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR-AND-A-HALF  BEFORE YOU CAN LAUNCH A TRIP BACK TO EARTH.
Jon: IF YOU GO TO MARS AND YOU GET THERE, YOU HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR-AND-A-HALF.
AT LEAST. FOR THE EARTH AND MARS TO REALIGN TO THEN MAKE THE TRIP BACK.
Jon: WHY DON'T THEY GIVE THE ROCKET A STEERING WHEEL? WHY DON'T THEY USE....
IT'S IT TAKES HUGELY MORE ENERGY IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK ON A WHIM. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE EFFICIENT PATHS AS EFFICIENT AS THEY CAN BE.
Jon: WHO IS GOING TO GO TO MARS AND WAIT THERE FOR A YEAR-AND-A-HALF TO TWO YEARS  EATING WHATEVER THE HELL WAS IN THAT BOWL YOU WERE EATING? THEY WILL NEVER GET ANYONE TO DO IT.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW PLANET. YOU THINK IF WE SEND THE RIGHT EXPLORERS THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT TO HAVE EARTH AND MARS  REALIGNED AGAIN? NO, THEY'LL BE EXPLORING. THAT'S WHAT EXPLORERS DO. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'D BE DOING BUT EXPLORERS WOULD BE LOOKING ALL OVER. I MEAN THAT'S WHAT EXPLORERS DO.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK THOUGH AFTER THE FIRST MONTH-- BECAUSE LET'S FACE FACTS. YOU'RE NOT WALKING THROUGH EPCOT CENTER. IT'S JUST MARS. YOU'RE LIKE LOOK THAT HOLE IS DEEPER THAN THE ONE WE LOOKED IN YESTERDAY. LIKE IT'S MARS. IT'S NOT....
MARS HAS DEAD VOLCANO AND RIVER BEDS THAT ARE DRIED. IT'S GOT FLOOD PLAINS. IT'S GOT ICE CAPS.
Jon: MARS PROBABLY USED TO BE VERY INTERESTING. BUT AT THIS POINT, HOW LONG CAN YOU SPEND IN YOUR BASEMENT?
IF IT'S A NEW PLANET, YOU KNOW,....
Jon: YOU'D BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
SIGN ME UP.
Jon: YOU WOULD GO? YOU NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON WOULD GO.
I'M TIRED OF DRIVING AROUND THE BLOCK BOLDLY GOING WHERE HUNDREDS HAVE GONE BEFORE. GIVE ME A PLACE TO GO AND I'LL GO. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S AN EXCITING SENSE OF ADVENTURE. I ON THE OTHER HAND FIND NEW WONDERS WITHIN THE WORLD WE INHABIT TODAY. FOR INSTANCE, DID YOU KNOW DUNKIN' DONUTS NOW OFFERS GRILLED CHEESE ON FLAT BREAD? I KNOW BECAUSE I'M AN EXPLORER.
NOW HERE'S THE THING. YOU CAN EXPLORE NEW FOOD ITEMS AT YOUR LOCAL COFFEE HOUSE. BUT YOUR LIFE IS NOT AT RISK. WE DON'T THINK, FOR HAVING DONE SO. ASTRONAUTS EN ROUTE TO MARS, THERE ARE MICROMETEORS GOING SIX TO TEN MILES PER SECOND THAT COULD PUNCTURE THEIR  SPACE CRAFT, PUNCTURE THEIR SPACE SUIT. THERE'S RADIATION FROM THE SUN. THERE'S THE KNOWN UNKNOWNS AND THE UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS AND THIS IS WHAT SEPARATES THE  EXPLORERS FROM THE REST OF US. IT'S THE EXPLORERS THAT GOT US OUT OF THE CAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
Jon: CAN YOU TELL YOU SOMETHING? GOD BLESS THE EXPLORERS BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY THE GUY WHO WOULD BE LIKE... BELIEVE ME. I'M ABSOLUTELY THE GUY GOING SABRE TOOTH TIGER, HUH?
I, THAT THING IS SHARP. THAT BEING SAID, THE SCIENTISTS EXPLORING THINGS LIKE THE LIFE SPAN THING. THAT IS FASCINATING.
CAN WE LIVE FOREVER.
Jon: CAN WE?
NOT YET. BUT THERE'S GREAT....
Jon: THAT'S FOR A SHORT PROGRAM.
BUT WE CAN LIVE MUCH LONGER, WE THINK. BECAUSE YOU CAN WATCH AS THE ORGANS DECAY WITHIN YOU AND FAIL, THERE ARE WAYS OF  REPLACING ORGANS NOT WITH CYBERNETIC ATTACHMENT OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S ORGANS OR SOME  OTHER ANIMAL'S ORGANS BUT ORGANS THAT YOU GROW FROM YOUR OWN CELLS. ALL THESE BIG QUESTIONS ARE QUESTIONS WE TOW WITH US IN OUR DAY. SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THOSE ANSWERS MIGHT BE. WE GO INTO THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS NEXT GENERATION OF DISCOVERY  THAT WILL ENABLE THE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS.
Jon: I LOVE YOU. LET ME SAY THIS TOO. LET ME SAY THIS TOO. HERE'S WHAT I LOVE THE MOST. YOU SAY TO ME WE'RE NOT JUST MAKING STUFF UP. BUT HERE'S THE BEST PART ABOUT IT. YOU COULD BE. I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA.
ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON THE FRONTIER OF KNOWLEDGE BETWEEN WHAT IS  KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, REACHING OUT INTO THAT ABYSS, SOMETIMES YOU DO ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE  STUFF UP THAT MIGHT BE TRUE SO THAT YOU CAN ORGANIZE A RESEARCH PLAN TO FIND OUT  WHETHER OR NOT IT IS.
Jon: THAT'S FASCINATING. A FAKE... A FALSE BRIDGE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU JUST A COUPLE OF FOOTHOLDS TO POSSIBLY FIND THE TRUTH.
THIS IS THE CREATIVITY OF DISCOVERY. THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS.
Jon: WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?
BUT THOSE WHO DO, ALL OF SOCIETY FOLLOWS THEM INTO THOSE DIRECTIONS.
Jon: I FEEL LIKE THIS ENTIRE SPECIAL IS LIKE SIX EPISODES OF ME BEING INADEQUATE.
PEOPLE ARE EXPLORERS.
EINSTEIN HAS A LOT OF GOOD QUOTES. IMAGINATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWLEDGE. THERE IT IS.
Jon: WOW. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THE NEW SEASON OF NOVA SCIENCE  NOW PREMIERES ON PBS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT 8:00. I URGE YOU TO WATCH IT. IT IS ALWAYS FASCINATING. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
