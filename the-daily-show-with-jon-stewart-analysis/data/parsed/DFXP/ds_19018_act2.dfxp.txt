A CERTAIN NEWS NETWORK SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS HAS BEEN OCCASIONALLY FRUSTRATING, LIKE WHEN THERE'S  A BREAKING NEWS INCIDENT THEY FAN OUT IN THE STREETS AND GUESSES AT [BLEEP] THAT  MIGHT BE HAPPENING.
WE CAN LOOK AT THIS CHOPPER RIGHT HERE IF WE CAN. THIS IS APPARENTLY SOME KIND OF RESCUE CHOPPER.
LOOK AT THE CARS THAT ARE COMING. SOMETHING JUST HAPPENED. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
IT'S REALLY BAD. BUT GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE PRAISE THEM FOR DOING THINGS WE LIKE EVEN IF WE LIKE THEM FOR  FACETIOUS AND NEFARIOUS REASONS.
IT'S TIME FOR THE DAY AWARD BUT BEFORE WE GET THERE LET'S GO TO THE COUCH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  LET ME REAL QUICK, WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO WATCH. THAT'S CNN'S MORNING TEAM HEADING FROM THEIR DESK TO THEIR COUCH. AND WHAT WE SEE AS A SIMPLE MECHANICAL BLOCKING ISSUE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF DURING THE COMMERCIAL BREAK BUT THEY LOOK AT IT AS AN NEWS-PORTUNITY.
EVERY DAY WE'RE WORKING TO BE AN EVEN BETTER COMPANY AND TO KEEP OUR COMMITMENTS. AND WE MADE A BIG COMMITMENT TO AMERICA. IN FACT, WE'VE INVESTED OVER $55 BILLION HERE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS MAKING BP AMERICA'S LARGEST ENERGY INVESTOR. OUR COMMITMENT HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER.
Jon:  WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THEY CAME BACK FROM COMMERCIAL TO A COMMERCIAL COVERING WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE DURING THE COMMERCIAL. AND THE CHERRY ON TOP. THE COMPANY THAT IS SPONSORING THIS NEWS SEGMENT IS ACTUALLY IN THE NEWS QUITE A BIT. MOSTLY FOR STORIES ABOUT HOW HARD THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TO GET GULF COAST AQUATIC BIRDS OUT OF THEIR OIL. THE COUCH WALK IS SO GLORIOUSLY UNNECESSARY I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH IT. THEY'RE BANGING THEM OUT LEFT AND RIGHT. SOMETIMES THEY WALK TO THE COUCH ON JUST A WHIM.
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION BRAIN FOOD? IT TURNS OUT THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT. WHAT YOU EAT CAN AFFECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S A COUCHABLE CONVERSATION. [LAUGHTER]
DO I HAVE TO SIT ON A COUCH TO HEAR IT OR CAN I -- I -- LET ME SAY SOMETHING TO THE HEADS OF CNN, PEOPLE WHO RUN CNN. DON'T MAKE THESE PEOPLE DO THAT. THEY SEEM LIKE NICE PEOPLE MOSTLY. DON'T CRUSH THEIR SPIRITS.
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOMETIMES STORIES THAT ARE NOT EXACTLY WALK TO THE COUCH FRIENDLY.
THE WOMAN WHO JUST DEFIED ALL THE ODDS FINISHED THE MOST DIFFICULT IRONMAN RACE EVER THE KONA RACE WITHOUT HER LEGS, THE ULTIMATE GOOD STUFF AND WE'LL GIVE IT TO YOU EARLY TODAY BUT BEFORE WE DO WE'RE GOING TO HEAD OVER TO THE COUCH. [LAUGHTER]
LOOK AT US WITH OUR FUNCTIONAL LEGS AS WE HEAD OVER TO THE COUCH. LOOK AT US LADIES. DA, DA, DA DA DA DA. I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE JIG. NOT TO LOOK A GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH BUT I'M SERIOUSLY THINKING THEY JUST BRAINSTORM WAYS [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, MY FAVORITE THERE: SMELL THE NEWS.
Jon:  MY POINT IS THIS. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ROLLING OUT THE SPONSORED SEGMENTS. IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR BEMUSED LOOK. [LAUGHTER] THAT LEADS PERFECTLY INTO TONIGHT'S, IF YOU ONLY NEED THIS MUCH TO FILIBUSTER WHY DO THEY HAVE TO GET THIS TO FILIBUSTER. WOW, THAT WAS TERRIBLE. THE PERFECT ENTREE TO -- JON STEWART CRUMBLES HIS SCRIPT IN DISGUST. SPONSORED BY ARBY'S BECAUSE YOUR HUNGER IS STRONGER THAN YOUR MEMORY. IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING ... ARBY'S IS NO LONGER OUR SPONSOR. SO BP... WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
