(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT FORMER SECRETARY OF LABOR CURRENTLY A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY FEATURED IN THE UPCOMING DOCUMENTARY FILM INEQUALITY FOR ALL.
WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION RISING COSTS. THE RISING COSTS OF RENTS FOR HOMES, DRAMATICALLY INCREASING COSTS FOR HEALTH CARE, THE RISING COST OF CHILD CARE AND ALSO THE RISING COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, RISING MUCH FASTER THAN INFLATION, TAKE ALL OF THESE INTO CONSIDERATION, AND YOU FIND THAT IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN JUST STAGNATING WAGES, IT'S BASICALLY MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES OFTEN WITH TWO WAGE EARNERS WORKING HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER AND GETTING NOWHERE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, ROBERT REICH. (APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, JON.
AN UPBEAT FILM, RIGHT.
Jon: IT IS AN UPBEAT FILM. AND YOU KNOW ME, I LIKE ANY FILM WITH A POWER POINT PRESENTATION, KNOCKED RIGHT IN THERE.
YEAH.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THOUGH. WE KNOW THE DISTURBING STATISTICS. WE KNOW HOW BAD IT IS. I WANT TO FOCUS ON-- YOU'RE AN UPBEAT MAN.
I AM AN UPBEAT MAN, I'M AN OPTIMIST.
Jon: SO TELL ME, GIVE ME LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS VERY DARK TUNNEL. INCOME INEQUALITY IN AMERICA IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE, IT'S GETTING MORE AND MORE RIGID. HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THIS TRAP?
WELL, WE GET OUT OF IT THE WAY WE GOT OUT OF IT IN 1901. YOU REMEMBER THAT.
YEAH. I MEAN THE PROGRESSIVE ERA. IF WE HAD HAD THIS CONVERSATION IN 1900 WE WOULD HAVE HAD A HUGE INEQUALITY GAP IN THIS COUNTRY, CORRUPTION OF OUR POLITICAL PROCESSES,  URBAN SQUALOR, ROBBER BARONS RUNNING ROUGH SHOD OVER AMERICA AND  YOU WOULD HAVE SAID TO ME IN 1900, THE EARLIER VERSION OF THIS SHOW, HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THIS AND I WOULD HAVE SAID WE'RE COMING UP TO A KIND OF A TIPPING POINT. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, JON. I THINK IT'S ABOUT 1901. AND THEN-- .
Jon: WOULD YOU HAVE SAID THAT, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT PRESCIENT. IS THERE A COUNTRY WE WOULD HAVE ATTACKED AROUND THAT TIME?
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ATTACK A COUNTRY. IT'S JUST, WHAT HAPPENS IS WE GET TO A POINT IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THE IDEAL THAT WE ALL LIVE BY, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IS SO FAR FROM THE REALITY THAT WE LIVE IN EVERY DAY THAT THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE JUST BRINGS FORTH CITIZEN ACTIVISM.
Jon: IS THERE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. IN 1901 IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION.
IT BECOMES A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. THAT IS WE GET A PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAX IN THAT ERA IN THE PROGRESSIVE ERA. WE HAVE ANTI-TRUST, ANTI-MONOPOLY LAWS. IT STARTS WITH CITIZEN ACTIVISM. IT STARTS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SO BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PISSED OFF. THEY SAY I'M TO THE GOING TO TAKE THIS ANY MORE. THIS IS NOT THE SOCIETY I WANT TO LIVE IN. IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENED AGAIN IN THE 1930s, IN THE 1960s, 1963 THROUGH 1969. AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. AND OUR MOVIE IS GOING TO ACTUALLY PRECIPITATE IT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE FACED SIMILAR ISSUES AND THEIR VERSION OF ACTIVISM WERE, YOU KNOW, REVOLUTION.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU KNOW IN THIS COUNTRY WE DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF THAT IN TERMS OF TURMOIL BUT WE DO HAVE A HISTORY OF MITIGATING THAT THROUGH SOCIAL PROGRAMS OR THROUGH LEGISLATIVE METHODOLOGY. THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT ON THE TABLE ANY MORE.
IT'S NOT ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW BUT WE DO REFORM. WE DID NOT SUCCUMB IN THE 30s TO FASCISM OR COMMUNISM IN THE PROGRESSIVE ERA. AS WINSTON CHURCHILL REPEATEDLY SAID, AMERICANS ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING EVENTUALLY AFTER THEY'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES. (LAUGHTER) AND I THINK WE WILL. YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY YOU LOOK AT, I MEAN LOOK, EVEN-- I MEAN EVEN THE GAY RIGHTS AND GAY MARRIAGE. I MEAN THIS IS A MAJOR CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR TIME. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON IT IF YOU HAD ASKED ME YOU KNOW TEN YEARS AGO, 12 YEARS AGO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I WOULD HAVE SAID YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH. IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG TIME. WE DO THE RIGHT THING, JON. BE UPBEAT. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU. YOU KNOW, WE TALK ABOUT CLASS WARFARE. ANY TIME YOU TALK ABOUT WHEN INCOME INEQUALITY GETS LIKE THIS OR WHEN WE START TO VALUE INVESTMENT SO MUCH MORE THAN LABOR WHICH IS, I THINK, WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS, IF YOU BRING THAT UP IT IS CLASS WARFARE. TO REGISTER A COMPLAINT AGAINST A SYSTEM IS CLASS WARFARE. YET TO TURN AROUND AND DIMINISH PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY NEED FOOD STAMP ASSISTANCE OR BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NEED OTHER TYPES OF ASSISTANCE, THAT IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE ALWAYS ALLOWED PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR FOOTING AND FIND A WAY OUT OF THAT PREDICTMENT, THAT IS NEVER CONSIDERED APPARENTLY CLASS WARFARE. THAT IS JUST LOOKING OUT FOR GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE.
WELL, THERE IS AN IDEOLOGY THAT HAS COME ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS VERY, VERY KIND OF MEAN-SPIRITED. BUT IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY WHO IS, YOU KNOW, CONSERVATIVE AND SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE GIVING FOOD STAMPS, YOU SAY LOOK IT, SHOULDN'T IT BE A COUNTRY IN WHICH EVERYBODY WHO IS WORKING FULL-TIME, IF ARE YOU WORK HARD, WORKING FULL-TIME, SHOULDN'T YOU GET OUT OF POVERTY. SHOULDN'T BE BE ABLE TO RAISE YOUR FAMILY. THEY SAY WELL YEAH, YEAH. AND I SAY WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN SHOULDN'T THE MINIMUM WAGE BE RAISED TO BEING A LIVING WAGE, ENOUGH FOOD STAMPS SO EVERYBODY CAN MAKE IT IF THEY ARE WORKING FULL-TIME? AND A LOT OF PEOPLE COME AROUND. YOU KNOW, BUT-- .
Jon: WORKING FULL-TIME, BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT, YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE OTHER THING ABOUT SOME OF THESE POOR PEOPLE, THEY HAVE TWO OR THREE JOBS, AREN'T THEY JOB HOGGING. ISN'T THAT REALLY THE ISSUE?
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE.
Jon: SHOULDN'T THERE BE A MORE SOCIALIST JOB DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY, FRANKLY.
Jon: BUT IT'S NOT JUST PEOPLE THAT WORK-- IT'S THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW IF ARE YOU UNDEREMPLOYED OR NOT EMPLOYED, THAT YOU ARE LAZY AND GAMING THE SYSTEM THAT IS-- THAT THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT POOR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE COASTING ON THE BENEFICIENCE OF ALL THE RICH BENEFITS THAT THEY CAN JUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. IT'S A LIE, IT'S A STRUGGLE AND THERE IS NOT A PERSON IN THAT SITUATION THAT DOESN'T WANT OUT OF THAT SITUATION.
OF COURSE IT A HUGE LIE. AND IT'S PERPETRATED, UNFORTUNATELY, BY SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING EXTREMELY WELL. I MEAN WHAT WE-- THE LATEST RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE TOP 1% ARE NOW TAKING HOME ALMOST 23% OF TOTAL INCOME IN THIS COUNTRY, THIS IS A NEW RECORD. ALL, 95% OF THE -- .
Jon: SO WHY NOT CHANGE THE TAX STRUCTURE TO BE MORE PROGRESSIVE. WHY END THE SOCIAL SECURITY TAX-- WHY CAP IT, WHY NOT JUST KEEP GOING. WHY NOT MEANS TEST SOME OF THESE BENEFITS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
WELL, I'M WITH YOU.
Jon: BUT THAT SEEMS SIMPLE.
WELL, I AGREE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT SO WHY DON'T THEY DO THAT? WHY IS THAT-- WHY IS THAT SO HARD POLITICALLY?
I'LL TELL YOU.
Jon: WHY IS THAT DIFFICULT.
THE REASON IT'S DIFFICULT IS BECAUSE WITH RISING INEQUALITY AND CONCENTRATED INCOME AND WEALTH AT THE TOP ALSO COMES A LOT OF POLITICAL POWER AT THE TOP. AND UNLESS WE GET BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, WE ARE GOING TO FIND IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO DO ANYTHING IN THIS COUNTRY THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.
Jon: WELL, ALL RIGHT--  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WILL YOU STICK AROUND? ALL RIGHT, INEQUALITY FOR ALL. IT PLAYS IT IN SELECT CITIES BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 27th. ROBERT REICH, HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. (APPLAUSE)
