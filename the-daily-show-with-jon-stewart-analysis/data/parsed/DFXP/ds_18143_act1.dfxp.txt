Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON  STEWART WHO HAS BEEN SPENDING  THE ENTIRE SUMMER AT TRAINING CAMP WITH THE NEW YORK GIANTS. APPARENTLY HE'S EXTREMELY HAPPY  AND IN ALMOST CONSTANT PAIN. OUR GUEST TONIGHT TV LEGEND AND  HOST OF THE NEW SHOW CROWD GOES  WILD ON FOX 1 REGIS PHILBIN IS  HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] OH, YES, INDEED. WE START TONIGHT WITH THE NEWS  MEDIA. NOW, PERSONALLY I GET ALL MY  NEWS FROM JON STEWART AND THE  DAILY SHOW. WHICH IS WHY I HAVE ABSOLUTELY  NO IDEA WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING  THIS SUMMER. BUT APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE GET  THEIR CURRENT AFFAIRS FROM  NEWSPAPERS. OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM PAPER  TELEVISION. I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE  THE "NEW YORK TIMES," THE WALL  STREET JOURNAL, OR WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THAT FREE THING IS THAT  PEOPLE SHOVE IN YOUR FACE  WHENEVER YOU GET INTO THE  SUBWAY. THE POINT IS A FREE PRESS IS OF  COURSE THE BACKBONE OF A  DEMOCRACY. BUT INCREASINGLY THAT FREE PRESS  HAS HAD QUITE A HIGH PRICE TAG.
THE "WASHINGTON POST," THE  CITY'S LEGENDARY YET STRUGGLING  NEWSPAPER SOLD TO ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S WEALTHIEST MEN,  AMAZON.COM CHAIRMAN JEFF BEZOS.
THE "WASHINGTON POST" IS IS  NOW OWNED BY THE HEAD OF AMAZON  AND ITS 14 PRINT SUBSCRIBERS ARE ALREADY NOTICING ONE DIFFERENCE  BECAUSE THE PAPER NOW COMES IN  LUDICROUSLY WASTEFUL PACKAGING. BUT I WILL SAY THEY'VE MADE IT  MUCH EASIER TO RETURN THE NEWS  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT. STILL, THIS ACQUISITION RAISES  SOME BIG QUESTIONS. FIRST, HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE THAT  GUY'S NAME? (PRONOUNCING IT DIFFERENTLY N) I  DON'T KNOW. SECONDLY, ARE YOU SURE THAT THIS  IS A GOOD INVESTMENT?
FOR 0 YEARS THE "WASHINGTON  POST" HAS BEEN OWNED BY THE  GRAND FAMILY EARNING A REPUTATION FOR TOP INVESTIGATIVE  JOURNALISM. BUT LIKE MOST PAPERS, IT  STRUGGLED OVER THE PAST TEN  YEARS.
ITS CIRCULATION IS HALF WHAT  IT WAS IN '93.
IT LOST MORE THAN $50 MILLION  LAST YEAR.
John: OH, MY GOD. I THINK I GET IT. THIS IS JUST BEZOS' CAR WASH. IT'S A FRONT FOR A MASSIVE METH  OPERATION. SAY HIS NAME IT'S HE EUVMENT  SENBEZOS. SO IF THIS IS NOT A MONEY MAKER,  WHY IS HE DOING THIS?
BEZOS CAN SPEND AN ENORMOUS  AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE  "WASHINGTON POST" WITHOUT REALLY TAKING TOO MUCH OF A DENT IN HIS  OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE SO HE HAS  THE LEEWAY TO MAKE MAJOR  EXPERIMENTS.
John: NOW IT MAKES SENSE. HE'S SO RICH IT JUST DOESN'T  MATTER. IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION OF  WHY SO MUCH AS IT IS WHY THE [BLEEP] NOT? LET'S ALL JUST BE HAPPY THAT ALL  HE'S EXPERIMENTING ON IS PRINT  JOURNALISM AND HE'S NOT SPENDING $250 MILLION TO CROSS BREED A  ROTWEILLER WITH A PEACH. DELICIOUS AND VICIOUS. SAY HELLO TO GEORGIA'S STATE  ANIMAL. PART OF ME WONDERS, IF HE'S JUST  DOING THIS SO THAT HE CAN RUSH  INTO THE PRINTING ROOM AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING AND SCREAM, "STOP  THE PRESS" AND THEN CHUCKLE TO  HIMSELF AND SAY, IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT AND THEN SHUT DOWN THE  NEWSPAPER. I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT. OR MAYBE HE GOT THE IDEA FROM  SOME OF HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS.
THE OWNER OF THE BOSTON RED  SOX IS BUYING THE GLOBE. ERIC CURBNER HAS BOUGHT THE  REGISTER AND BILLIONAIRE WARREN  BUFFET HAS BOUGHT DOZENS OF  PAPERS.
John: BASICALLY THERE ARE  MORE PEOPLE CURRENTLY BUYING  NEWSPAPERS THAN PEOPLE BUYING  NEWSPAPERS. FOR MORE ON THIS WE TURN TO OUR  DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN  HODGEMAN. JOHN? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JOHN, I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY WOULD, JOHN, WHY WOULD JEFF  BEZOS WANT A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER? IS HE BORED? IS HE TRYING TO BUILD A LEGACY?
A LEGACY? WHAT GREATER LEGACY COULD THERE  BE THAN CONVINCING AMERICANS TO  SUBSCRIBE TO TOILET PAPER? NO, I'LL TELL YOU . JEFF BEZOS  BOUGHT THE "WASHINGTON POST."  IT'S BECAUSE HE'S A POOPY-HEAD. WITH POOP IN HIS HEAD.
John: THAT SOUNDS PERSONAL  AND EXTREMELY JUVENILE.
I KNOW, JOHN, BUT JEFF BEZOS  HAS BEEN ONE-UPPING ME MY ENTIRE  CAREER. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE THE  ACQUISITION OF MY OWN D.C. NEWSPAPER.
John: WHICH ONE? IT'S A MAJOR NEWSPAPER. WHY?
John: THE WASHINGTON TIMES? IT'S THE WASHINGTON COUPON  CLIPPER PENNY SAVER. BUT SOON TO RELAUNCH AS THE  "WASHINGTON POSTIER" COUPON  SUPER PENNY SAVER. I CAN'T LOSE THOSE COUPON  CLIPPERS. THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO BUY  PRINT NUCHS ANYMORE SNON HOW  MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THAT?
$900 MILLION. John: WHAT? IT WAS GOING TO BE MORE BUT I  HAD A COUPON.
John: IS IS THIS A GOOD IDEA,  JOHN? NEWSPAPERS HAVE NOTORIOUSLY  BECOME MONEY-LOSING BUSINESSES.
I'M GOING TO DISRUPT THE  PARADIGM. THAT'S BILLIONAIRE SPEAK FOR [BLEEP] [BLEEP]. YOU SEE, NEWSPAPERS THOUGHT THAT  PEOPLE WANT TO PAY MONEY FOR  INFORMATION. BUT WE NOW KNOW FROM THE  INTERNET THAT WHAT THEY REALLY  WANT IS IS THEIR OWN OPINIONS FED BACK TO TO THEM FOR FREE. MY NEWSPAPERS WILL BE PRINTED IN  THREE EDITIONS TO CATER TO THE  LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE AND CAD VIDEO ENTHUSIASTS.
John: THAT IS A POWERFUL  GROUP.
40% OF OUR ECONOMY, JOHN. NOW, LOOK AT JEFF BEZOS' RAG  FROM THIS MORNING. OBAMA PUSHES INTERNET PROPOSAL. (SNORING) FACTUAL, BORING. BUT MY READERS WITH THE SAME  STORY WILL HAVE THEIR CHOICE OF  THREE PERSONALIZED HEADLINES. FIRST, OBAMA EMPOWERS PROCEED  LEE TEAR YAT WITH WI-FI. OR BLACK HITLER WASTES TAX PAYER  MONEY... AGAIN. OR OBAMA CAN HAVE INTERNET?
John: I HAVE TO JUMP IN HERE,  I DON'T KNOW. LOOK, I AM NO EXPERT IN  BUSINESS.
AS YOUR SHABBY SCREAMS TO MY  TERRIFIED EYES.
John: BUT WON'T PRINTING'S  THREE EDITIONS OF PAPER TRIPLE  YOUR COSTS.
YES, JOHN, BUT I'LL MAKE UP  FOR IT BY DOUBLE-TRIPLING MY  ADVERTISING.
John: HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE,  HODGMAN? NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING HAS FALLEN  50% IN THE LAST DECADE.
MY NEWSPAPER IS GOING TO TAKE  A CUE FROM CUTTING EDGE  TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS RADIO AND REALITY TELEVISION BY USING  PRODUCT PLACEMENT. NOW LET'S SEE HOW SCOOP BEZOS  REPORTS THE INTERNATIONAL NEWS. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY  AFFIRMED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE  SYRIAN GOVERNMENT. NICE WORD BEZOS. YOU JUST MISSED A HUGE REVENUE  STREAM. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN TODAY  AFFIRMED HIS SUPPORT FOR SYRIA'S  GOVERNMENT WHILE ENJOYING A ICE COLD MOXIE SODA. WHICH IT TURNS OUT IS NOT  DISGUSTING. THAT TASTE.
John: NO SERIOUS NEWS OUTLET  WOULD EVER ENGAGE IN THAT KIND  OF SHAMELESS BEVERAGE.
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN THE  OPENING SEQUENCE OF MORNING JOE  BREWED BY STARBUCKS.
John: I DO THINK MY POINT  ABOUT SERIOUS NEWS OUTLETS  STANDS. THIS IS ALL WINDOW DRESSING,  HODGEMAN. ARE YOU GOING TO OFFER THE  READERS ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVELY  NEW IN TERMS OF ACTUAL CONTENT?
OF COURSE. EXCLUSIVE PREMIUM CONTENT. FOR THOSE SELECTIVE READERS  WILLING TO PAY AN EXTRA FEE I  WILL ALSO SEND AN ACTUAL HUMAN BEING THE A PLACE WHERE NEWS IS  HAPPENING. AND THAT PERSON WILL LOOK AROUND  AND ASK QUESTIONS AND WRITE DOWN  WHAT'S GOING ON.
John: THAT'S JUST CALLED  BASIC REPORTING.
OH, REALLY? I CALL IT HODGE'S ON PRIME. I SAID IT, BEZOS. COME AT ME, POOPY HEAD. WHY DON'T YOU SUE ME IF YOU'VE  GOT THE...
John: OKAY. WE'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD  HERE. THIS IS WHAT CONCERNS ME. THE PRESS IS A VITAL PART OF ANY  DEMOCRACY. IT SEEMS TROUBLING THAT  NEWSPAPERS SHOULD BECOME THE  IDLE PLAY THINGS OF A FEW  WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.
THE GREAT ROMANTIC MYTH OF  THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AMERICAN  PRESS. THAT WHISKEY-FLAVORED BOMB ON  THE LIVER OF THE INEVITABLY  DIVORCED NEWSPAPERMAN. THE TRUTH IS, JOHN, THE NEWS  GAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE HOBBY  OF A FEW RICH MEN. TED TURNER, RUPERT MURDOCH. ALL THE WAY BACK TO WILLIAM  RANDOLPH HURST.
WILLIAM RANDOLPH HURST  STARTED THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR  JUST TO SELL PAPERS. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO  THAT ERA?
YES. I'M A DERANGED MILLIONAIRE. OF COURSE I DO. LET ME SHOW YOU THE FIRST COPY  OF TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER. HOT OFF THE PRESSES.
John: YOU ARE NOT SERIOUSLY  GOING TO RUN WITH THAT HEADLINE,  ARE YOU?
NOT THE CAT LOVERS' EDITION,  OF COURSE.
John: THANK YOU, JOHN. JOHN HODGEMAN, EVERYONE. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
