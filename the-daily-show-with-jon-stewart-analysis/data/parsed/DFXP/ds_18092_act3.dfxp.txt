Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS DEAN OF THE  JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED  INTERNATIONAL STUDIES. HE IS ALSO A BESTSELLING AUTHOR  WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE  DISPENSABLE NATION." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, VALI NASR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME.
THE BOOK IS CALLED THE  DISPENSABLE NATION:  AMERICAN  FOREIGN POLICY IN RETREAT. IS THAT BAD, IS THAT WE ARE--  BECAUSE, IF I RECALL, WHEN WE  WERE ON OFFENSE, WE MADE A-- I DON'T KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT  AN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS--  ( BLEEP ). WE MADE A-- IT WAS BAD, IT WAS  BAD. IS RETREAT BAD FOR AMERICA?
WELL, TOO MUCH OFFENSE WASN'T  GOOD. TOO MUCH DEFENSE IS ALSO NOT  GOOD. THERE ARE TOO MANY PROBLEMS OUT  THERE, AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS  THEM, AND WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY.
Jon:  WHERE WOULD YOU  LIKE TO SEE US RIGHT NOW BEING  MORE ACTIVE?
I THINK IN THE MIDDLE EAST,  LARGELY BECAUSE MANY THINGS  HAPPENING THERE HAVE GREAT DEAL OF IMPACT ON US, ON OUR ECONOMY,  ON OUR SECURITY. AND THERE'S ALSO THE FUTURE OF  THAT REGION IS RIGHT NOW BEING  WRITTEN IN PLACES LIKE EGYPT AND  SYRIA.
Jon:  RIGHT.
AND WITHOUT AMERICAN  LEADERSHIP IN THE SENSE OF  GIVING SOME KIND OF GUIDANCE TO COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, TAKING  A CERTAIN STANCE, THINGS ARE NOT  GOING TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION.
Jon:  RIGHT.
ULTIMATELY, WE WILL END UP  HAVING TO GET INVOLVED AND FIX  IT AT SOME POINT, EXCEPT IT'S GOING TO COST US A LOT MORE.
Jon:  BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT  GETS US INTO TROUBLE-- ISN'T THE  RIGHT DIRECTION  SELF-DETERMINATION? AND EGYPT HAS BEGUN THIS ROAD TO  SELF-DETERMINATION. MAYBE WE'RE NOT CRAZY ABOUT WHO  THEY ELECTED, AND MAYBE RIGHT  NOW THEY'RE NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT IT, EITHER, BUT ISN'T THAT PART  OF THAT FREEDOM SPREADING  PROCESS? ( LAUGHTER )  I MEAN, WASN'T THAT THE GOAL, TO  DO THAT WITHOUT US INVADING?
WELL, INVASION WAS DEFINITELY  WRONG. IT'S WRONG FOR AMERICA TO LEAD  ITS FOREIGN POLICY WITH ITS  MILITARY. THAT, CLEARLY, WE SHOULD LEARN A  LESSON AND NOT DO THAT AGAIN. THEN THERE ARE ALSO, IF YOU LOOK  AT EVERY OTHER FREEDOM. -- EVERY OTHER DEMOCRATIZATION  AROUND THE WORLD, AMERICA HAS  HAD A VERY BIG ROLE IN IT. NOT WITH ITS MILITARY, BUT WITH  ITS ENGAGEMENT, AND ECONOMIC  ASSISTANCE, AND GETTING THE REST OF THE WORLD TOGETHER IN ORDER  TO HELP AT A CRITICAL MOMENT.
Jon:  IN LIBYA, I GUESS  WE GOT TOGETHER WITH NATO AND  BOMBED AROUND THE AREA. I DON'T--  ( LAUGHTER )  I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT WE  DID, BUT WE CERTAINLY BOMBED IN KIND OF A, I GUESS YOU CALL IT A  SERPENTINE KIND OF PATTERN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon:  THAT WAS GOOD BUT  OW THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM WITHN  WHAT WE FEEL ARE RADICALS TAKING OVER THAT AREA. IF YOU INTERFERE, DOESN'T THAT  CREATE RESENT INDEPENDENT THAT  AREA?
THAT'S BECAUSE WE ONLY  INTERFERE ALL THE TIME  MILITARILY. IN THATY SENTENCE SENSE WE  HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL.
Jon:  DON'T WE GIVE THEM  ECONOMIC AID?
THAT'S MOSTLY FOR THE  MILITARY. IF YOU COMPARE WHAT WE DID FOR  POLAND OR ARGENTINA OR-- ALL OF  THESE AREAS THAT BECAME DEMOCRATIC, WE WERE ENGAGED TO  HELP THEM REFORM THEIR  ECONOMIES. WE WERE ENGAGED WITH CIVIL  SOCIETIES. WE DIDN'T JUST BOMB AND KICK THE  DICTATOR OUT.
Jon:  BUT WE'RE AFRAID OF  THEM. THAT'S WHEN WE BUILD THE  EMBASSIES -- THE EXWAESS OVER  THERE ARE BIG TARGETS ARE, THEY  NOT?
THEY ARE, BUT THIS GETS INTO  BIGGER TROUBLE. YOU CAN'T IGNORE A REGION OF 300  MILLION PEOPLE WHICH SITS RIGHT  NEXT DOOR TO EUROPE WHO CAN SEND TERRORISTS ALL THE WAY TO  AMERICA. ULTIMATELY, WE'LL HAVE TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT. LOOK THE SYRIA. WE'VE BEEN SAYING WE DON'T WANT  TO GET INVOLVED. WE DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. AND FOR GOOD REASON. BUT THE PLACE IS GRADUALLY  FOLLOWING INTO THE HANDS OF  EXTREMISTS. TWO TO THREE MILLION OF THE  POPULATION WOULD HAVE LEFT THE  COUNTRY BY THE END OF THE YEAR AS REFUGEES. AT THE END, WE CANNOT IGNORE  SYRIA BEYOND A POINT. WE'LL HAVE TO GET INVOLVED. BUT BY THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A  LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE ONLY GOING  TO DO IT MILITARILY, AND THAT'S  NOT A GOOD IDEA. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD,  PARTICULARLY NAREGION, HAVE TO  SEE US BE ENGAGED.
Jon:  IS THAT EVEN  REALISTIC ANY MORE? DO WE EVEN HAVE THAT KIND OF  SOFT POWER?
I THINK WE DO. WE OWE IT TO OURSELVESES TO TRY  SOFT EXPOWR NOT ALL THE TIME TRY  MILITARY POWER.
Jon:  I'M WITH YOU ON  THAT ONE.
WE WENT WITH A $100 BILLION A  YEAR FOOT PRINT IN THE COUNTRY  TRYING TO BUILD A SWITZERLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIMALAYA  MOUNTAINS AND IT WAS ALL  MILITARY AND WE FAILED AT IT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO TRY  WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE BALKANS  AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TO USE OUR GLOBAL INFLUENCE TO GET  PEOPLE TOGETHER TO SEE WHETHER  IT'S POSSIBLE TO ARRIVE AT A DEAL AND THEN GET THE  INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO  SUPPORT THAT. THAT'S WHAT HAS MADE AMERICAN  LEADERSHIP IMPORTANT AROUND THE  WORLD. WHEN PEOPLE USED TO TALK ABOUT  AN INDISPENSABLE NATION, THEY  WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN INVAIGD, OCCUPYING FORCE. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A  COUNTRY WHICH HAD A VISION AND  HAD THE ABILITY TO GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND WAS THE ONLY  COUNTRY THAT COULD GET PEOPLE TO  FIND PEACEFUL, ECONOMIC, DIPLOMATIC, WAYS OF SOLVING --
BUT ALWAYS BACKED UP WITH A  BIG STICK. THE TAKEAWAY OF THIS IS LESS  BOMBING, LESS INVADING, LESS  PUNISHMENT, MORE NICER. ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT'S RIGHT. THE BIG STICK IS GOOD --
SPEAK SOFTLY, AND THEN WE'LL  HAVE A CONVERSATION. ( LAUGHTER ).
TRY, TRY.
Jon:  VERY INTERESTING. "THE DISPENSABLE NATION."  IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
