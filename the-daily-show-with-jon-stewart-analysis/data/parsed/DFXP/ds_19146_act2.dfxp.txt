Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THIS COUNTRY'S UNEMPLOYMENT FORECAST HAS BEEN CLOUDY WITH CHANCE OF SUCKS STORMS, SO IT GIVES ME REALLY GREAT PLEASURE TO FINALLY REPORT GOOD NEWS ON THE JOBS FRONT.
FORMER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR HAS A NEW JOB.
Jon: HOORAY! GOOD FOR HIM. GOOD FOR HIM. YOU KNOW, WHEN HE LOST HIS SEAT TO A PRIMARY OPPONENT IN JUNE, CANTOR COULD HAVE STOPPED COLLECTING HIS GOVERNMENT CHECKS AND JUST LAZED AROUND COLLECTING GOVERNMENT CHECKS. WHO COULD HAVE BLAMED HIM? ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS OPPONENT, DAVID BRAT, SPENT THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN BEATING CANTOR UP FOR CORPORATE CRONYISMY.
BIG BUSINESS IS IN BED WITH BIG GOVERNMENT.
WELL, YOU MAY BE AGAINST BIG BUSINESS IN BED WITH BIG GOVERNMENT, BUT I GUARANTEE THERE'S A PORN MAGAZINE DEVOTED TO THAT, I WOULD THINK. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, SCREW YOU AND YOUR HURTFUL SLANDERS, BRAT. CAN'TOR'S MOVING ON TO BETTER THINGS. SO WHAT'S THIS NEW JOB? WHAT DOES HE GOT THERE? WASHINGTON THINK-TANK, GENTLEMAN'S FARMER, PERHAPS HE'S GO EPONYMOUS AND BECOME A CANTOR. YOU KNOW, THE HIGH HOLIDAYS ARE COMING.
HE'S NOW JOINING INVESTMENT BANK MOELIS & COMPANY AS VICE CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR.  CANTOR WILL ALSO BE ELECTED TO ITS BOARD OF DIRECTOR'S.
Jon: HE JUST [BLEEPED] GOT RIGHT INTO BED, DIDN'T HE? HE GOT INTO BED. WAIT A SECOND, THIS GUY IS A LAWYER. HE NEVER WORKED ON WALL STREET. WHAT DOES HE BRING TO THE BOARD OF AN INVESTMENT BANK?
ERIC CANTOR HELPS MOELIS ADVISE, ADVISES THEM ON HOW TO NAVIGATE VERY DIFFICULT TERRAIN IN WASHINGTON.
Jon: DIFFICULT TERRAIN IN WASHINGTON FOR INVESTMENT BANKERS. INVESTMENT BANKERS ALREADY HAVE A WASHINGTON EZ PASS. IT'S CALLED MONEY. AND IT'S THE ONLY MAP THEY NEED. THEY MUST BE PAYING HIM A PITTANCE FOR THIS SO-CALLED SERVICE.
HE'S GOING TO GET A BIG, FAT PAYCHECK.
THE PAY PACKAGE WORTH $3.5 MILLION. [AUDIENCE REACTS] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THREE AND A HALF MILLION BUCKS? HERE ARE THE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS AFTER HEARING THAT NEWS. [CASH REGISTER RINGING] HOW MUCH LONGER DO I HAVE TO BE HERE? 4:00 P.M.? NOW, ADMITTEDLY CANTOR HAS SOME EXPERIENCE IN FINANCIAL MATTERS, LIKE IN 2007, WHEN HE FORMED A GROUP THAT SUCCESSFULLY BLOCKED EFFORTS TO RAISE THE CARRIED INTEREST TAX RATE. AND IN 2009, WHEN HE CONVINCED ALL REPUBLICANS TO VOTE AGAINST THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM ACT, AND DON'T FORGET 2012 WHEN HE BLOCKED ATTEMPTS TO REQUIRE POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE CONSULTANTS WHO SELL INSIDER CONGRESSIONAL INFORMATION TO HEDGE FUNDS AND INVESTORS TO DISCLOSE THEIR ACTIVITIES. AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S THIS.

HE IS THE FOURTH HIGHEST RECIPIENT OF POLITICAL DONATIONS FROM WALL STREET AND CONGRESS.
SO, DON'T BEGRUDGE CANTOR THAT $3.5 MILLION. IF ANYTHING IT'S NOT A SALARY FOR HIS NEW JOB. IT'S PAYMENT FOR SERVICES ALREADY RENDERED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
