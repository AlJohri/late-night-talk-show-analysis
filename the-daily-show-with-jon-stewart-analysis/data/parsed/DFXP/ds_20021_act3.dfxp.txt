(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THEY GOT THEMSELVES A LITTLE BOOK THERE, CAME TOGETHER, TO CO-AUTHOR, WE HAVE THE NEW BOOK "OUTLAW PETE" PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND FRANK CARUSO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT I NOW, NOW, I WANT TO BE CLEAR. FOR THOSE OF YOU, IT'S CALLED "OUTLAW PETE"-- FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE WHO KNOW YOU, MR. SPRINGSTEEN, ONLY AS AN AUTHOR--  (LAUGHTER) YOU ALSO HAVE A MUSICAL CAREER (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW, FRANK, YOU'RE AN ILLUSTRATOR, AND YOU  LOVE THE MUSIC OF YOUNG BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN.
I DO.
Jon: HOW DO YOU GET IN CONTACT TO SUGGEST THIS IDEA OF AN ILLUSTRATED OUTLAW PETE. OUTLAW PETE IS A FABULOUS SONG.
WELL, I THINK I DID A BUNCH OF SKETCHES AND SHOWED THEM TO MY FRIEND DAVE MARSH.
Jon: OH SO DAVE MARSH.
DAVE WAS PRETTY HIP ON IT.
Jon: MARSH IS BASICALLY A SPRINGSTEENOLOGIST WHO BASICALLY HAS ARCHIVED AND CHRONICLED, THE CHRONICLES OF SPRINGSTEEN.
THAT'S WELL PUT.
A FEW THINGS AND DAVE SAYS I KNOW BRUCE, I CAN GET YOU IN TOUCH WITH HIM.
WE FIGURED, LET'S RUN IT BY HIM.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE A WISE CHOICE.
THAT WAS THE FIRST THING TO DO, TO DO THAT. AND I WAS DOING DAVE'S SHOW, WORKING ON ANOTHER BOOK AND I FINISHED THE SKETCHES FOR THIS, VERY ROUGH, VERY ROUGH. AND FLOATED THEM BY BRUCE.
Jon: DAVE MARSH COMES BY AND SAYS BRUCE I HAVE THIS GUY  WHO'S DRAWN SOME PICTURES.
HE DOESN'T DO THAT.
Jon: WHAT DOES HE DO?
BASICALLY THERE IS A HUGE PILE OF STUFF, IN A LITTLE TINY ROOM WHEN I COME DOWN IN THE MORNING, SOMETIMES I WANDER OVER TO THAT ROOM
Jon: THE PILE ROOM.
THE PILE ROOM, AND I START DRIFTING THROUGH WHATEVER IS THERE. SO ONE MORNING WHEN I WAS GOING  THROUGH IT I CAME UPON FRANK'S SKETCHES. AND THEY WERE SENT TO ME BY DAVE. AND I LOOKED AT THEM AND I HAD SAID THESE ARE GOOD, THESE ARE GOOD. AND I SAID WELL, MAYBE I WILL CALL HIM AND SEE WHAT-- SEE WHAT THIS IS.
Jon: HOW MANY YEARS AFTER YOU SUBMITTED THIS TO THE PILE ROOM--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID MR. SPRINGSTEEN FIND HIS WAY.
RIGHT AFTER GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK.
Jon: TO BE CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME, PLEASE DO NOT SEND BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN YOUR DRAWINGS -- NOW THIS IS ALSO, I WANT TO SHOW, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GET THIS, CAN WE GET THIS ON THERE, CAN WE GET THAT? NOW THIS IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE A YOUNG COWBOY WEARING A DIAPER
I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS NOT A KID'S BOOK.
WELL, IT IS A KID'S BOOK. AND WE FIGURED IF THEY COULD TAKE THE DEATH OF MUFASA
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE WHAT WAS IN THIS BOOK.
Jon: NOW THERE IS A GENTLEMAN IN HERE, THERE IS A GENTLEMAN IN HERE WHO TAKES WHAT I BELIEVE IS A KNIFE TO THE CHEST.
YES.
Jon: SO-- SO-- ALL RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHEN YOU ARE READING THIS AT BEDTIME, AND THE CHILD SAYS OH, DOES THAT COME OUT. DOES THAT-- NO, HE DIED, HONEY. SWEET DREAMS WHAT IS THE --THIS JUST CHARTS THE STORY OF OUTLAW PETE.
YES, IT'S THE STORY OF THIS LITTLE BABY BANK ROBBER.
Jon: SIX MONTHS OLD, ALREADY SPENT A FEW MONTHS IN JAIL IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.
AS HE GOES THROUGH LIFE. IT'S KIND OF AN EXISTENTIAL FAIRY TALE. WE DON'T LIKE TO WRITE DOWN TO OUR AUDIENCE.
Jon: EXACTLY. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE COLLABORATION? ARE WE GOING TO SEE? BECAUSE YOU HAVE, LET'S FACE FACTS THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF LITERARY TYPE CHARACTERS IN YOUR SONGS. THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT THAT COULD BE DONE THERE, VISUALLY IN TERMS OF BOOKS. IS THIS A ONE-OFF  TYPE OF OPERATION? WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH?
(LAUGHTER)
WE ONLY MET A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
Jon: DO YOU --
I SAW IT AS MORE OF ILLUSTRATING A CHARACTER THAN A SONG.
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING.
YOU SEE THIS MORE OF THE STORY OF OUTLAW PETE NOT THE SONG OF OUTLAW PETE.
IT WAS THE STORY THAT BRUCE WROTE. IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS COMBING THROUGH THE CATALOGS SAYING "SHOULD I DO JUNGLELANDS?"
IT IS REALLY FRANK'S BOOK. OUTSIDE OF LOOKING AT THE DRAWINGS, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'M GOING HAVE YOU SWITCH SEATS YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. SO CAN YOU DRAW? ARE YOU A GENTLEMAN --
NO, I CANNOT DO  STICK FIGURES
Jon: I GOT NOTHING, TOO. I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT. BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE HERE'S HOW MUCH I ADMIRE YOU. I FEEL LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO DRAW, YOU COULD AND THAT WOULD UPSET ME. CAN YOU SING?
NO.
Jon: YOU ARE A PERFECT MATCH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW THE THING ABOUT, WHAT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING, I SEE YOUR MUSIC, HE STARTS OUT A BABY AND GROWS TO BE A MAN. I SEE YOUR WHOLE CATALOG AS SORT OF CATALOGING THAT JOURNEY FOR PEOPLE. THIS SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A MICROCOSM, IS THAT WHAT SPOKE TO YOU ABOUT THE PROJECT.
YEAH I MEAN LISTENING TO BRUCE'S SONGS OVER THE YEARS, YOU SEE THEM DIFFERENT WAYS, DIFFERENT SONGS. IT COULD BE A BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE, AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IN LIFE. WHEN THIS ONE HIT, IT PLAYED OUT AS THIS BOOK. THE CHARACTER, THE MUSIC, THE WAY HE SANG IT. AND IT TOLD A STORY. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE I HAD TO DO.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. BECAUSE I'M THE SAME WAY. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I RELATED TO CERTAIN SONGS. MAYBE BLINDED BY THE LIGHT, MAYBE MORE, YOU KNOW, THOSE SORT OF MORE EXISTENTIAL, MORE TRIPPY AS I GOT OLDER, A LITTLE MORE YEARNING, YOU KNOW. GOT INTO THE RIVER, THE RISING, ALL THAT. BUT NOW THAT I'M THE AGE I'M AT, I STAND IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR, NAKED, AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SING? YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SING. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I SING ♪ MY CITY'S IN RUIN  ♪ (LAUGHTER) MY CITY'S IN RUIN ♪ ♪ I LOVE, AND THE DRAWINGS, A LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLES, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS, MANY DIFFERENT STYLES OF IT WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING.
THE SONG MATURES. THE CHARACTER GROWS UP.
Jon: AND THE DRAWING AS WELL.
THE MOOD, THE FEELING, THE COLORS, IT'S ALL IN  THE MUSIC.
Jon: VERY NICE.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I JUST CATALOG ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS.
Jon: YOU STILL GET HALF, 50%, WHAT DO YOU GET HERE?
THE KID'S RUNNING A RACKET.
Jon: OUTLAW PETE IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, GO GET IT. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, FRANK CARUSO.
