>>WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, EVERY PART OF AMERICA HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE STRENGTHS. THE MIDWEST SMALL TOWN CHARM, GOOD DOWN HOME PEOPLE. THE SOUTHWEST HAS -- [LAUGHTER] -- DRY HEAT AND LET'S GO WITH THE HANTAVIRUS. FLORIDA HAS A LOT OF ROADS THAT LEAD OUT OF FLORIDA. [LAUGHTER] BUT HERE IN THE NORTHEAST OUR STRENGTH, OUR PRIDE, OUR SIGNATURE DISH, IF YOU WILL, IS OUR INDISPUTABLE LEAD IN CRIME AND CORRUPTION. NO ONE, NO ONE DOES CORRUPTION BETTER THAN THE NORTHEAST, BABY. FROM BOSS TWEED, TO WHITEY BULGER TO NEW JERSEY'S CLASSIC SYNAGOGUE MONEY LAUNDERING SLASH HUMAN ORGAN TRAFFICKING FAD OF 2009. WE'VE HAD SERPICO, ABSCAM. I THINK THE MAYOR OF PROVIDENCE MIGHT HAVE ASSAULTED A GUY WITH A FIREPLACE LOG. EVEN CONNECTICUT, LET'S BE HONEST NOBODY ELSE IN THE REGION LIKES OR RESPECTS, EVEN CONNECTICUT OCCASIONALLY JAILS ITS GOVERNORS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES JUST TO KEEP UP WITH THE NEIGHBORS. AND THIS WEEK WE NOR'EASTERS GOT OURSELVES ANOTHER GOLD STAR ON THE WRAP SHEET.
CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMM ARRESTED EARLIER TODAY. HE'S BEEN TAKEN TO FBI HEADQUARTERS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. HE FACES CORRUPTION CHARGES.
Jon: GRIMM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DOES THAT NAME SOUND SO FAMILIAR?
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER GRIMM FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN HE THREATENED TO THROW A TELEVISION REPORTER OVER A BALCONY.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE OF GREATEST SENTENCES EVER UTTERED ON -- YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT GUY WHO TRIED TO THROUGH A NY1 REPORTER OVER A BALCONY.
LET ME BE CLEAR TO YOU. YOU EVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN, I'LL THROW YOU OVER THIS (bleep) BALCONY. I'LL BREAK YOU IN HALF. LIKE A BOY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I NEVER GOT THAT. I NEVER GOT THAT WHOLE EXCHANGE. HOW DO YOU NOT CLOSE WITH I'M GOING TO THROW YOU OFF THIS (bleep) BALCONY? THAT IS YOUR END LINE. I'M GOING TO THROW YOU OFF THIS (bleep) BALCONY AND I'M GOING TO BREAK YOU IN HALF LIKE A BOY. -- YOU ALREADY THREW HIM OFF A (bleep) BALCONY. BREVITY IS THE SOUL OF THREAT, MY FRIEND. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DID THE FEDS CHARGE BALCONY BOY WITH?
OBSTRUCTING AND IMPEDING IRS FUNCTIONS, CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD THE UNITED STATES, CAUSING FALSE TAX RETURNS TO BE FILED, MAIL FRAUD, WIRE FRAUD, HEALTH CARE FRAUD, PERJURY, OBSTRUCTION OF AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING, AND THE HIRING OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M IN A BIT OF A HURRY HERE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST NAME ALL THE (bleep) HE DIDN'T DO. THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS CLASSIC, CLASSIC NORTHEASTERN CORRUPTION. I'M TELLING YOU. YOU HAVE YOUR HOT HEADED PUBLIC OFFICIAL. MASSIVE BUST BY THE FEDS. ALL THAT IS MISSING IS SHADY BACKROOM DEALINGS IN A DANK RESTAURANT.
THESE CHARGES STEM FROM MICHAEL GRIMM'S ROLE IN MANAGING THE RESTAURANT HE OWNED AND OPERATED.
Jon: BOOM! WAIT, LET ME SET THE SCENE. I CAN PICTURE IT NOW. IT'S A CLASSY ITALIAN JOINT. WHERE A MOZZARELLA SO CREAMY IT'S LIKE BUTTER. WITH A GABAGOOL TO DIE FOR. THEY'VE GOT MEATBALLS, A GLASS OF (bleep) BAROLO AND A BIG PLATE  OF --
IT'S ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE ON THE MANHATTAN IT'S A HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT AS YOU CAN SEE CALLED HEALTHALICIOUS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'M SORRY HEALTHALICIOUS. YOU DON'T EVEN CALL IT HEALTH-ILISH? YOU'RE DOING THIS AT A HEALTH FOOD JOINT?
HEALTHALICIOUS WAS A SMALL BUSINESS AND THEY SOLD CASUAL FOOD SO MANY PEOPLE USED CASH. AND IT WAS THIS CASH THAT MICHAEL GRIMM EXPLOITED. MAKING OVER $1 MILLION SIMPLY DISAPPEAR.
Jon: IS THIS WHAT NORTHEASTERN CORRUPTION HAS COME TO? CLOSING BRIDGE LANES AND SKIMMING A LITTLE OFF THE TOP OF A BROCCOLI AND LENTIL JOINT? ALL RIGHT. IF THAT'S HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED THESE DAYS I BRING YOU A SCENE I CALL GLUTEN FELLAS. â™ª  I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG MUSIC. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.
LOOK, IF IT ISN'T TOMMY. I'M SURPRISED YOU ARE NOT IN YOUR PAJAMAS EATING CEREAL.
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD, BILLY, I DON'T EAT GLUTEN NO MORE.
YEAH ME, TOO, CLOGS ME UP.
YEAH YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF GET YOUR OMEGAS.
YEAH I'M ALL ABOUT THE GOOD FATS. NOW GO HOME AND GET YOUR MOTHER (bleep) CHEERIOS BOX. KEEP THEM HERE (bleep) (bleep). [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU WONDER WHY I DON'T ACT IN VERY MANY MOVIES. [LAUGHTER] I CAN'T EVEN GET THE (bleep) PUPPETS ON MY FINGERS. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. WHAT ARE WITH TALKING ABOUT HERE? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? THAT'S RIGHT,  GRIMM SHADY. ALL RIGHT. HE MAY BE SCARED OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL BUT HE IS NOT SCARED OF THE LAW.
I WILL GET RIGHT BACK TO WORK AS I ALWAYS HAVE. WITH HONOR AND DISTINCTION I WILL SERVE AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I HAVE AN ELECTION TO WIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HOW CAN I LEAVE WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO DO? SO MANY MORE RESTAURANTS I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN LIKE A SALAD BAR CALLED KALE TO THE CHIEF. OR MAYBE FOR ASIAN FOOD, MISO HEALTHY. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
