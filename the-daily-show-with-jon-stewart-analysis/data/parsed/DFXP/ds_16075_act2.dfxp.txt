COMING UP ON THE SHOW, OUR INSATIABLE SEARCH FOR OIL HAS FORCED TO US DO BUSINESS WITH SOME OF THE  WORLD'S POST DANGEROUS REGIMES. IT TURNS OUT THE MOST DANGEROUS MAY BE CLOSER THAN WE THINK. WYATT CENAC HAS MORE.
WE'VE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE MUST GET OFF FOREIGN OIL.
AMERICA'S DEPENDNESS ON OIL IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS OUR NATION FACES.
IT LEAVES US MORE VULNERABLE TO HOSTILE REGIMES AND TO TERRORISTS.
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET SERIOUS WE MUST EXAMINE THE PLAYERS, PARTICULARLY THE  BIGGEST, MOST DANGEROUS PLAYER OF ALL.
RIGHT NOW OUR LEADING SUPPLIER OF IMPORTED OIL IS CANADA.
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S CANADA.
IT GIVES US ABOUT $2 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY WHICH IS ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH  AS WE ARE CURRENTLY GETTING FROM SAUDI ARABIA.
CANADA. I KNEW IT. FOR TOO LONG WE'VE COZIED UP TO THEIR DICTATORS, OPENED OUR BORDERS TO THEIR  MOST-- AND IGNORED THEIR INSTITUTIONAL BRUTALITY, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN-- OH, THAT'S GOT TO HURT. YES, BIT BY BIT CANADA IS KILLING US.
I FLEW TO THE OIL FIELDS OF ALBERTA TO CONFRONT OUR CANADIAN OIL OVERLORDS.
WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I CALL YOU SHEIKH OR WAR LORD OR YOUR LORDSHIP.
I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT BUT YOU CAN JUST CALL ME DREW.
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT CANADA IS A BLOOD AND OIL SOAKED --
NO CANADA IS A VERY WELCOMING, WARM COUNTRY. THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO BE GREAT NEIGHBORS.
SUCH ARROGANCE. AND WORSE, IT'S AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT ARE KEEPING THESE OIL BARRONS IN BUSINESS. SOMEONE HAS TO SEND THEM A MESSAGE.
FIRST QUESTION, WELL, EVIL CANADA, WE'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH CANADA FOR MANY YEARS. WE MAY HAVE SMALL DIFFERENCES BUT WE ARE REALLY CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.
REALLY, YOU'RE OKAY WITH CANADA?
CANADA'S FINE.
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR DAUGHTER HAD HER HEALTH CARE PAID FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT. AS A FATHER HOW YOU COULD LIVE WITH YOURSELF.
I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF AN AMERICAN.
YOU DISGUST ME, SIR. ALSO, DO YOU HAVE SOME KLEENEX BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO CON GUIL A LITTLE BIT HERE.
SURE THE PROPAGANDA SOUNDS GREAT, UNTIL YOU TALK TO THOSE WHO HAVE MANAGED TO  ESCAPE THE EVIL MAP EL REGIME.
SO YOU ARE CANADIAN REFUGEES.
AH, WE WERE BORN AND RAISED IN TORONTO.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE LIVING IN THAT REPRESSIVE REGIME.
OH, WHAT'S THIS SHOW ALL ABOUT?
YEAH WHAT IS ABOUT IT?
IT'S THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.
OH.
THAT'S THAT SHOW WHERE THEY MAKE YOU LOOK SILLY ON.
MAKE YOU LOOK STUPID.
WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF CANADIAN STOOGES.
NO, TAKEOFF, EH. GO HOME, YANKEE, EH.
I FELT THAT SAME ANGER ON THE CANADIAN STREET WHERE AMERICA HAS BECOME THE  SCAPEGOAT FOR ALL OF CANADA'S PROBLEMS.
WHY ARE YOU ANGRY AT AMERICA?
A LOT OF REASONS. NUMBER ONE, VANCOUVER CANUCKS. WE WANT THE IN ORDERIQUE BACK. YOU TOOK THE WIN BEG, THAT WAS TOO MUCH. BULLY SKOAL. YOU A HOCKEY FAN.
NO, I'M AMERICAN.
HERE A NEW GENERATION OF CANUCKO FACISTS ARE BEING TRAINED TO HATE. CLEARLY IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY STRIKE.
I THINK THEY'RE MORE AFRAID OF US THAN WE ARE OF THEM TO BE HONEST.
SO ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD INVADE CANADA BEFORE CANADA INVADES US?
THAT'S ALL I NEED RIGHT THERE, YES.
AS AMERICANS WE SIMPLY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.
AMERICANS HAVE A CHOICE. A PERSONAL CHOICE. EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A CHOICE TO USE FOSSIL FUELS OR NOT.
DONE, ALL RIGHT, EASY. WE'LL STOP USING YOUR OIL.
LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN, THOUGH. OBVIOUS TRANSPORTATION MEANS WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE. YOUR CELL PHONE, VIDEO GAMES, MP3 PLAYERS, YOUR I PADS, ALL THESE THINGS ARE MADE FROM A PETROCHEMICAL OR PETROLEUM-BASED PRODUCTS.
WHAT ABOUT INTERNET PORN.
THAT WOULD BE GONE.
I WAS BEGINNING TO SEE POLITICS IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT. MAYBE CANADA WASN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL.
