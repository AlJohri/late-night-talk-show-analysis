JUNE 22, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR MITCHELL ZUCKOFF, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ON AN HEROIC WORLD WAR  II RESCUE MISSION. AS WITH LAST NIGHT'S SHOW, I WILL ASK HIM TO PERFORM LIVE SURGERY ON THE SHOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW LAST NIGHT. CAMERON DIAZ SEWED UP ONE OF MY HEMORRHOIDS. DID YOU SEE IT? YOU GUYS DON'T WATCH THE SHOW, DO YOU? [LAUGHTER] WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A QUESTION. YOU EVER BEEN JUST FED UP, TO THE BREAKING POINT? YOU THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT, ENOUGH WITH THE RAT RACE, CHASING SOME MATERIALISTIC DREAM. I'M GOING TO CHUCK IT ALL, SELL MY STUFF, MOVE TO A FISHING VILLAGE, DRINK OUZO, EAT LAMB  ALL DAY AND CHARM TOURISTS WHILE EXISTING ON A PENSIONER'S STIPEND. SOUNDS NICE. AND IT IS. [LAUGHTER] NOW, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF AN ENTIRE COUNTRY HAD THAT IDEA? [LAUGHTER] AT THE SAME TIME. I PRESENT TO YOU GREECE 2011.
YOUNG PROTESTERS WERE JOINED BY THE ELDERLY, BATTLING THROUGH  TEAR GAS AND HURDLING ANYTHING FROM INCENDIARY DEVICES TO GREEK YOGURT.
YOUNG PEOPLE. YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE ELDERLY THROWING INCENDIARY DEVICES AND YOGURT. [LAUGHTER] I WONDER WHO WAS THROWING THE INCENDIARY DEVICES AND WHO WAS THROWING THE YOGURT. [LAUGHTER] THOSE RIOTERS ARE UPSET ABOUT PROPOSED AUSTERITY MEASURES THAT WOULD END GREEK CITIZEN BENEFITS  SUCH AS SIX PAID VACATION WEEKS A YEAR AND RETIREMENT WITH 80% PAY AND BENEFITS AT AGE 53. AND WORD IS THE RIOTING MAY SPREAD. WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT GREEKS GET TO RETIRE WITH 80% PAY AT 53. [LAUGHTER] HOW CAN GREECE AFFORD THIS? FUNNY STORY.
WITH A POPULATION OF 11 MILLION, IT HAS A DEBT OF NEARLY HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED]! GREECE $480 BILLION DEBT FOR 11 MILLION PEOPLE. YOU IRRESPONSIBLE CHILDREN. THAT IS LIKE... [LAUGHTER] $44,000 OF DEBT PER PERSON. DON'T GIVE ME, THAT WELL, THE UNITED STATES HAS DEBT, TOO. YES, YES, WE DO HAVE A $14 TRILLION DEBT, BUT WE HAVE 307 MILLION PEOPLE, SO OURS WORKS  OUT TO... WHAT'S THAT? OH, $45,000 PER PERSON. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT WE GET TO RETIRE NEVER. [LAUGHTER] HEY, GREECE, HOW ARE YOU GUYS SO GOOD WITH MONEY? NOW, YOU MAY BE WONDERING, ASIDE FROM THE COMICAL MENTAL IMAGE OF OLD GREEK PEOPLE THROWING YOGURT  AT THE POLICE, WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THE GREEK ECONOMY?
IN THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO, ECONOMISTS SAY THE GREEK DEBT CRISIS COULD BECOME EUROPE'S LEHMAN BROTHERS, A CATASTROPHIC  FAILURE THAT FREEZES THE CREDIT MARKETS AND INFECTS THE U.S. ECONOMY.
Jon: THE U.S. ECONOMY? BUT THAT'S WHERE WE LIVE. [LAUGHTER] SOMEONE, QUICK, GET ME SOME YOGURT. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY AASIF MANDVI LIVE IN ATHENS. ASSIF, HOW DID EUROPE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL, HOW DOES THIS AFFECT EUROPE? FIRST OF ALL, HOW DID EUROPE NOT KNOW THAT GREECE WAS IN THIS TYPE OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE?
WELL, JON, IT'S FASCINATING. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN GREECE REALIZED THAT TO COVER EVEN AT THAT TIME THEIR BIG DEFICIT, THEY WERE GOING TO NEED AN INFLUX OF CASH, THEY WERE VERY SMART. THEY CALLED AN AMERICAN INVESTMENT BANK.
Jon: LET ME GUESS -- GOLDMAN SACHS.
VERY GOOD. GOLDMAN SACHS CAME UP WITH A WAY TO HIDE THE EXTENT OF GREECE'S DEBT SO EUROPEAN BANKS WOULD  CONTINUE LENDING TO GREECE, AND GREEK PEOPLE COULD CONTINUE RETIRING A FEW YEARS AFTER PUBERTY. [LAUGHTER] THE DEVICE THEY USED TO DO IT WAS CALLED "A CURRENCY SWAP."
Jon: OH, OKAY, SO THE EUROPEAN BANKS WHO BOUGHT THESE SWAPS THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING  SOMETHING FISCALLY SOUND WHEN THEY WERE, IN THE PARLANCE OF WALL STREET...
OH, JON, MAY I?
Jon: HORSE [BLEEPED], YEAH, YEAH. SO NOW THE EUROPEAN BANKS ARE IN TROUBLE.
YES, BUT AFTER THEY BOUGHT THE GREEK BONDS, EUROPE DID SOMETHING VERY SMART. JUST ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT THE BONDS THAT THEY GOT FROM GREECE CONTAINED HORSE [BLEEPED], THEY  TRANSFERRED THE RISK OF THESE BONDS TO A THIRD PARTY USING A DEVICE THAT COULD MAKE MATH THE  RISK OF THESE TRANSACTIONS CALLED CREDIT DEFAULT...
Jon: MAY I? SWAPS.
SWAPS. EXACTLY.
Jon: WHO WAS THE THIRD PARTY?
WELL, THAT IS THE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE OF OUR INABILITY TO REGULATE THE SWAPS INDUSTRY, NO ONE HAS ANY [BLEEPED] IDEA. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: MAYBE AMERICAN BANKS, INCLUDING THE SAME ONES WHO ORIGINALLY HELPED GREECE CREATE THESE HORSE [BLEEPED] SWAPS?
WELL, IS WHATLG THE SMART MONEY SAYS, OR IN WALL STREET PARLANCE, BANKING.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY. GREECE. HEY, WHAT'S UP? [LAUGHTER] IT'S ME, JON. I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM, IS JON. YOUR GREEK SPIRIT IS CAUGHT IN A BATTLE OF DUALITY, TORN BETWEEN THE AGGRESSION AND TENACITY OF  THE SPARTANS VERSUS THE WISDOM AND SOPHISTICATION AND HOSPITALITY OF THE ATHENIANS. AN EPIC STRUGGLE BETWEEN SPARTA AND ATHEN, A PROFOUND 3,000-YEAR INTERNAL STRUGGLE THAT WE HERE  IN AMERICA HAVE IN TURN MADE OUR EXPERIENCE AT DINERS. AND THIS GUY. ♪ HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY ♪♪  [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WORLD HISTORY, BUT GREECE, TO SOLVE THIS YOU MUST OVERCOME YOUR DUALITY. RIGHT NOW WITH THE HITTING THE POLICE WITH CLUBS AND YOGURT, YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO SPARTAN. RETIRING AT 53 WITH ALMOST FULL PAY, A LITTLE TOO PLATO'S RETREATY. [LAUGHTER] BUT I KNOW YOU CAN STRIKE THIS BALANCE BETWEEN AUSTERITY AND HEDONISM. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT FIND APROPOS. ONE DAY A GOD NAMED ZEUS LOOKED DOWN UPON THE PEOPLE OF EARTH FROM OLYMPUS AND THOUGHT, I WILL  TURN PIETION INTO -- MYSELF INTO A BULL. AS A BULL, HE WENT DOWN AMONGST THE HUMANS AND [BLEEPED]. AND THAT'S WHY TODAY WE HAVE COCONUTS. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHO CAME UP WITH THAT? YOU DID. [LAUGHTER] GOOD LUCK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLA
