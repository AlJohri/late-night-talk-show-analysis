WE TURN NOW TO IRAN, WHERE TENSIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH AFTER NEW EVIDENCE THAT SCIENTISTS  THERE HAVE REVIVED THEIR TOP-SECRET NUCLEAR PROGRAM. EITHER THAT OR IRAN EMBRACING A NEW STYLE OF GLOW-IN-THE-DARK  ARCHITECTURE, "DARKITECTURE."  [LAUGHTER] NOW, A NEW DRAMA IS UNFOLDING.
IRAN CLAIMS IT HAS CAPTURED ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST SOPHISTICATED SPY PLANES.
THE IRANIANS SAY THEY HAVE THEIR HANDS ON AN RQ-170, A SECRET STEALTH AIRCRAFT THAT  CARRIES THE MOST ADVANCED CENSORS, CAMERAS AND LISTENING DEVICES FOR SPYING FROM THE AIR.
Jon: WHAT? THE RQ? OUR TOP-SECRET SPY PLANE THINGY IS IN IRAN? HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
U.S. OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS THAT C.I.A. OPERATORS ON THE GROUND WERE FLYING THE DRONE  WHEN IT SUDDENLY VEERED OUT OF CONTROL AND HEADED DEEP INTO IRAN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, "I'M NOT EXPERT, BUT THAT SOUNDS LIKE BULL  [BLEEPED]."  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S A FUNNY STORY. WE'RE JUST MINDING OUR OWN BUSINESS, FLYING OUR DROUGHNS, AND FLYING ON THE AFGHANS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN AGENT NUTMEG, THE C.I.A. CAT, JUMPS ON THE CONTROL. THEN THE WHOLE THINGS GOES WHOOO. ACTUALLY, ONE DAY LATER THEY HAD A MUCH BETTER EXPLANATION.
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE U.S. DRONE THAT WENT DOWN IN IRAN OVER THE WEEKEND. THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT WAS ON A C.I.A. MISSION AND WAS PART OF A SPECIAL FLEET OF STEALTH DRONES  THAT HAVE SPIED ON IRAN FOR YEARS FROM AN AFGHANISTAN AIR BASE.
Jon: YEAH, THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE SENSE. NO HARM NO FOUL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IRAN, YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO BLOW UP THE WORLD AND WE GOT OUTED AS  A HIGH-TECH PEEPING TOM. IT'S CALLED A DRAW. LET'S CALL THE WHOLE THING EVIL.
THE IRANIANS HAVE RECOVERED THAT WRECKAGE AND THE CONCERN  HERE IS THAT THEY'LL USE THOSE HIGH-TECH CAMERAS AND CENSORS TO TRY TO DEVELOP THAT TECHNOLOGY  FOR THEIR OWN.
IT COULD HAVE GLIDED INTO IRAN LARGELY INTACT. IF IT DID, THE DRONE'S SKIN, WHICH KEEPS IT INVISIBLE FROM RADAR, COULD BE AN INTELLIGENCE BONANZA.
Jon: WHAT? SO NOT ONLY DID WE NOT FIND OUT IF IRAN IS DEVELOPING DANGEROUS NEW TECHNOLOGY, WE INADVERTENTLY  GAVE THEM OUR DANGEROUS NEW TECHNOLOGY. OH, IRONY. SEEMS AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE INTENTIONALLY CRASHED THE DRONE OR ACTIVATED  ITS SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON. UNLESS WE GAVE IT TO IRAN ON PURPOSE. WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR OTHER NEW SEGMENT, "WELL PLAYED, IRAN. ENJOY YOUR TROJAN DRONE."  [APPLAUSE] YOU GOT OUR DRONE. YOU THINK THAT DRONE SKIN IS STEALTH SKIN? NO. IT'S ACTUALLY... IT ACTUALLY MAKES YOU MORE VISIBLE. IT'S LIKE THE PLAID OF DRONE SKIN. BESIDES, EVEN IF IT DID HAVE THE GOOD STEALTH TECHNOLOGY, WHICH  IT TOTALLY DOESN'T, IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR SINETISTS COULD EVEN FIGURE IT OUT.
ANALYST PETER SINGER SAYS IF THE RQ-170 IS RELATIVELY INTACT, THE IRANIANS WILL LIKELY GIVE THE DRONE TO CHINA
Jon: [BLEEPED]. OH, YEAH, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE IT TO CHINA, HUH? THAT BRINGS US BACK TO OUR EVEN NEWER NEW SEGMENT, "SORRY, IRAN, WE THOUGHT YOU WERE REAL COUNTRY, NOT CHINA'S BITCH." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
