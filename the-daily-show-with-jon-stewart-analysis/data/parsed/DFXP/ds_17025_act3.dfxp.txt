(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE'S AN EMMY AWARD WINNING WRITER. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "COOLS, CALM AND CONTENTIOUS." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MERRILL MARKOE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HELLO. NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. "COOL, CALM AND CONTENTIOUS." THIS IS SO WELL WRITTEN.
THANK YOU. THAT'S REALLY LOVELY OF YOU TO SAY.
Jon: WELL BECAUSE....
AND ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.
Jon: EXACTLY. THEY ASK ME SOMETIMES AND I SAY HOW MANY OF THESE BOOKS DO YOU READ BY THE GUESTS? I SAY, WELL, I (BEEP) MAY WAY THROUGH MANY OF THE INTERVIEWS MOSTLY WITH HIGH PROFILE  DIPLOMATS, ET CETERA. BUT THEN THESE COME ALONG. IT'S LIKE, THANK YOU. WHAT A GREAT WAY TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON AND EVENING READING THESE. THE ONE ABOUT YOUR MOTHER KILLED ME.
THAT IS SO LOVELY OF YOU TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE. MY MOTHER. IT OCCURRED TO ME AT SOME POINT WHEN I DID MY STUDIES-- BY THAT I MEAN TALKING TO MY  FRIENDS-- THAT ALL COMEDIANS SEEM TO HAVE ONE ONE OR TWO OF THE SAME PATTERN MOTHERS. IT'S LIKE THE SAME MOM INVENTED STAND-UP COMEDY RAISED ALL THE COMEDIANS. WHAT'S BAD FOR CHILDHOOD TRUST ISSUES IS REALLY GOOD FOR COMEDY ROUTINES. IT'S LIKE BEING RAISED BY A HECKLER.
Jon: (LAUGHING). HER DIARY. WHEN DID YOU DISCOVER YOUR DIARYS?
WELL, MY MOTHER HAS BEEN DEAD FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES NOW. RIGHT WHEN SHE DIED AND I WAS KIND OF PUTTING... GOING THROUGH HER STUFF AND  FIGURING... I KNEW SHE KEPT A LITTLE STACK OF DIARIES WHICH ARE IN THIS BOOK BY THE WAY. I GUESS I'LL BE GOING TO HELL RIGHT AWAY.
Jon: NO. THEY'RE MAGNIFICENT. I WOULD BUY A TRAVEL BOOK WRITTEN BY YOUR MOTHER.
I THINK SHE WAS KIND OF WRITING A TRAVEL BOOK. AFTER SHE DIED I WENT THROUGH HER DIARIES THINKING... SHE WAS A REALLY ANGRY PERSON. I THOUGHT I WOULD FIND OUT WHY SHE WAS ANGRY. I THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING IN HER DIARIES WHAT I DO IN MINE. . COMPLAIN. SHE WAS BUT SHE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT ALL THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. SHE WAS TRAVELING AND HAVING A BAD TIME EVERYWHERE. SHE WAS GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO PLACE JUST LEVELING EVERYONE.
Jon: WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT IS THERE'S NO REASON WHY. IT'S NOT, "MY LIFE, SO DIFFICULT." IT'S LIKE," I'M IN TURKEY. THE BEEF IS MUSHY." IT'S AWESOME.
I READ THE ONE TODAY THAT WAS FROM DUBLIN WHERE SHE SAID, "THE COUNTRYSIDE OF  DUBLIN DOES NOT ENCHANT ME."
Jon: (LAUGHING).
FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO ENCHANT YOU NECESSARILY. MY MOTHER WAS REALLY CRITICAL. WHEN I FIRST SHOWED HER SOMETHING I HAD WRITTEN, IT WAS THE PROBLEM I HAD WITH HER GROWING UP. THE FIRST TIME I SHOWED HER SOMETHING. SHE CONSIDERED HERSELF MY MENTOR AS A WRITER. SHE READS THIS THING AND I'M PACING AROUND IN MY ROOM. I COME OUT AND I SEE SHE'S STARING. I SAY, "SO, WHAT DID YOU THINK?" SHE SAYS, "I DON'T HAPPEN TO  CARE FOR IT BUT I PRAY I'M WRONG."
Jon: (LAUGHING) BUT THE DIARIES ARE SUCH A GIFT BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU AN INSIGHT. I'M SURE FOR THE LONGEST TIME YOU THOUGHT IT WAS PERSONAL TO YOU?
YES, I THOUGHT IT WAS PERSONAL. THEN AFTER SHE DIED I WAS GOING THROUGH ALL HER STUFF SO I WENT THROUGH THE DIARIES AND  I FOUND FOUND OUT THERE WASN'T A SINGLE COUNTRY ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH SHE HAVE WASN'T  COMPLAINING ABOUT BUT REALLY THE QUINTESSENTIAL THING WAS THAT I FOUND HER DICKENS  READER FROM COLLEGE. CHARLES DICKENS. I FOUND IN THE MARGINS OF OLIVER TWIST THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE: NOT ONE OF HIS BEST WORKS. I WAS NOT IMPRESSED.
Jon: (LAUGHING). WHEN I GOT TO THAT, IT KILLED ME.
IT KILLED ME. I THOUGHT," AND I'M LOOKING FOR PRAISE FROM THIS WOMAN.
Jon: IN A WEIRD WAY WASN'T THAT A GRAND RELIEF?
YEAH.
Jon: TO THINK, OH, SHE ACTUALLY PROBABLY THINKS I'M BETTER THAN DICKENS.
SHE DIDN'T GIVE THE WOMEN OF B ACHL LI A BREAK.
Jon: THE THING IN THERE, TOO, YOUR DAD. YOU SAID YOU CALLED HIM RIGHT AFTERWARDS TO CHECK ON HIM. HE COULDN'T TALK TO YOU.
HE SAID, MERRILL, LET ME CALL YOU BACK. I'M HAVING A HOT CUP OF COFFEE. BETWEEN THEM THEY WERE LIKE A TAG TEAM FOR LOW SELF-ESTEEM.
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. BUT YOU USED THIS FOR THE GOOD OF HUMANITY. THERE'S A GREAT CHAPTER IN THERE ABOUT HOW TO SPOT A (BEEP).
I'VE MADE MY LIFE'S WORK SPOTTING (BEEP) NOW. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S HARDER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY SOCIALLY  ACCEPTABLE WAYS TO EXHIBIT A PATHOLOGICAL LACK OF EMPATHY. BUT I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE ALL NEED TO LIVE BY. FOR INSTANCE, I THINK-- AND I KNOW THIS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL-- BUT I THINK  THAT YOU SHOULD PUT A SECRET GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU CARRY WITH YOU ON YOUR TEST  EQUIPMENT SECOND TO THE PERSON YOU'RE SITTING WITH. I KNOW THAT'S VERY CONTROVERSIAL.
Jon: IF I WERE AT THIS MOMENT, LET'S SAY, CHECKING EMAIL, THAT WOULD BE WRONG. I WOULD BE AN (BEEP).
I THINK THAT IS A SIGN OF AN (BEEP). IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD NOBODY IS EVER NOT ON THE PHONE ALL THE TIME INCLUDING WHEN THEY'RE  WALKING THEIR DOGS. I DO THIS JUST WHEN I'M WALKING MY DOGS JUST SO PEOPLE WON'T THINK I'M WEIRD. YOU HAVE TO NOW. BUT I THINK IT'S RUDE.
Jon: I DO THINK IT'S RUDE AS WELL. THERE'S SOMETHING HERE ABOUT DOGS IS GREAT. I THINK AFTER YOU READ THIS BOOK, I THINK (BEEP) SPOTTING WILL....
A NEW NATIONAL PASTIME.
Jon: A NEW NATIONAL PASTIME TO RIVAL BIRD WATCHING. ABSOLUTELY GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. "COOL, CALM, CONTENTIOUS." ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. MERRILL
