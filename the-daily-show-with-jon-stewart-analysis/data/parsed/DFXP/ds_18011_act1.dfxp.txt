NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART."  CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NICE ONE  FOR YOU TONIGHT. FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" 538  BLOCK, STATISTICIAN ALL-STAR  NATE SILVER WILL BE JOINING US  ON THE SHOW. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND THEN TOMORROW NIGHT IT'S  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. BUT STILL... [LAUGHTER] THESE PEOPLE GET TO... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NATE SILVER, THE PRESIDENT OF  STATISTICIAN-STAN. AS YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT THE  PRESIDENTIAL CAM PAN HEADED TO  HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY WHERE THE  CANDIDATES DEBATED FROM A DIVERSE CROWD HARD OF LONG  ISLANDERS RANGING FROM ITALIAN  GUYS TO OTHER ITALIAN GUYS TO A  JEWISH GUY AND HIS MOM. [LAUGHTER] SUCH DIVERSITY IN LONG ISLAND. THE FIRST QUESTION SOMEHOW ENDED  UP ON THE AUTO INDUSTRY RESCUE.
I KNOW YOU KEEP SAYING, YOU  WANT TO TAKE DETROIT BANKRUPT. WELL, THE PRESIDENT TOOK DETROIT  BANKRUPT. YOU TOOK GENERAL MOTORS  BANKRUPT. YOU TOOK CHRYSLER BANKRUPT. THAT WAS PRE-SIZELY WHAT I  RECOMMENDED AND ULTIMATELY WHAT  HAPPENED.
Jon: OKAY. IN FACT, OBAMA'S PUBLICLY  FINANCED DETROIT AUTO INDUSTRY  MANAGED BANKRUPTCY IS NOT  PRECISELY WHAT ROMNEY  RECOMMENDED. ROMNEY PRECISELY RECOMMENDED  PRIVATE CREDIT, WHICH AT THE  TIME WAS TO BE PRECISE  NON-EXISTENT. MEANING UNDER HIS PLAN DETROIT'S  BANKRUPTCY WOULD HAVE BEEN  UNMANAGED AND QUITE PERMANENT. SO THE BIG QUESTION WOULD BE:  WHICH VERSION OF BARACK OBAMA  WOULD RESPOND. THE FIRST DEBATE, SLEEPY TIME MA  GILL CUTTY OR PRETTY TALK JONES.
CANDY, WHAT GOVERNOR ROMNEY  SAID JUST ISN'T TRUE.
Jon: IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHOA, WHOA. YES, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  DECIDED TO ATTEND THIS DEBATE. [LAUGHTER] AND THE TWO CANDIDATES COULD  FINALLY HAVE A TRUTHFUL,  SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW  MUCH THEY [BLEEPED] HATE EACH  OTHER. [LAUGHTER]
GOVERNOR, WE HAVE ACTUALLY  PRODUCED MORE OIL.
NO, NO, HOW MUCH DID YOU CUT  LICENSES AND PERMITS ON FEDERAL  LAND AND FEDERAL...
PRODUCTION IS UP.
IT'S DOWN.
NO IT ISN'T.
PRODUCTION ON GOVERNMENT LAND  AND OIL IS DOWN 14%.
GOVERNOR, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING  JUST NOT TRUE.
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE IN A  MOMENT. I'M STILL SPEAKING. THE ANSWER IS --
IF YOU'RE ASKING A QUESTION.
THAT WASN'T A QUESTION. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
JON JON I BELIEVE YOU MEANT  TO ADD, MOTHER [BLEEPED]. ROMNEY WAS SHARP AND DREW BLOOD.
HE SAID THAT BY NOW WE'D HAVE  UNEMPLOYMENT AT 5.4%. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE IT  IS AND 5.4% IS MILLION AMERICANS  WORK, 9 MILLION.
Jon: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE  A MARK. BUT FOR EVERY POINT ROMNEY MADE,  THE PRESIDENT MADE MORE.
ROMNEY WAS FOR A ASSAULT  WEAPONS BAN BEFORE HE WAS  AGAINST IT. GOVERNOR ROMNEY DOESN'T HAVE A  FIVE-POINT PLAN. HE HAS A ONE-POINT PLAN. MY PENSION ISN'T AS BIG AS  YOURS. GOVERNOR, YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON  WHO IS GOING TO GET TOUGH ON  CHINA.
THE LAST PERSON WHO IS GOING  TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA IS THAT  GUY, ROMNEY. FOR GOD SAKE, ROMNEY WAS  ASSEMBLED AT A FACTORY IN  BEIJING. THAT'S WHY HE'S SO WELL  DESIGNED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ROMNEY ALSO... ROMNEY HAD SOME  OTHER ISSUES.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT  BUREAUCRATS IN WASHINGTON SHOULD  TELL SOMEONE WHETHER THEY CAN  USE CONTRACEPTIVES OR NOT.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD TELL THAT TO  YOUR DISEMBODIED VOICE THAT  SUPPORTED THE BLUNT MENTAL WHICH DOES LIMIT CHOICE.
OF COURSE I SUPPORT THE BLUNT  AMENDMENT. SOME STATE LAW. I TALKED ABOUT CONTRACEPTIVES. I MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION.
FOR THOSE OF YOU IN YOUR DORM  ROOMS CARVING AN APPLE WHOSE  EARS MAY HAVE PERKED UP AT THE MENTION OF A BLUNT AMENDMENT, IT  HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. LAUGH LAUGHTER AND ROMNEY HAD  SOME ODD MOMENT, LIKE WHEN  DESCRIBING HIS EFFORTs AS  GOVERNOR TO RECRUIT MORE WOMEN FOR CABINET POSITIONS.
I WENT TO A NUMBER OF WOMEN'S  GROUPS AND SAID, CAN YOU HELP US  FIND GROUPS. THEY BROUGHT US BINDERS FULL OF  WOMEN. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: A COUPLE THINGS. [LAUGHTER] ONE, THE WOMEN'S GROUP WAS  CALLED MASCAP, AN THEY  APPROACHED GOVERNOR ROMNEY, NOT  OTHER WAY AROUND, AND, TWO, MY GUESS IS THEY DID NOT REFER TO  WHAT THEY PRESENTED AS "WHOLE  BINDERS FULL OF WOMEN."  [LAUGHTER] BUT PERHAPS REFERRED TO IT AS A  WELL-ORGANIZED COLLECTION OF  QUALIFIED RESUMES. BUT HEY, BINDER OF WOMEN, BOOK  OF BROADS, NOTEBOOK OF NIPPLE,  WHATEVER, WHATEVER. BUT, OF COURSE, MITT ROMNEY  STILL HAD AN ACE IN THE HOLE. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S  CONFUSED HANDLING OF THE  CONSULATE ATTACK IN LIBYA THAT  KILLED FOUR AMERICANS.
IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK,  AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THAT  TO BE TOLD TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. WHETHER THAT WAS SOME MISLEADING  OR INSTEAD WHETHER WE JUST  DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, I  THINK YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW FIVE DAYS  LATER WHEN THE AMBASSADOR TO THE  UNITED NATIONS WENT ON TV TO SAY  THAT THIS WAS A DEMONSTRATION. HOW COULD WE HAVE NOT KNOWN?
Jon: BOOM! MR. PRESIDENT, YOU JUST WALKED  INTO A MITT STORM.
THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK,  GOVERNOR, I STOOD IN THE ROSE  GARDEN AND I TOLD THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE AND THE WORLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO FIND OUT EXACTLY  WHAT HAPPENED, THAT THIS WAS AN  ACT OF TERROR AND I ALSO SAID  THAT WE'RE GOING TO HUNT DOWN THOSE WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME.
Jon: FORCEFUL, REMIND  PEOPLE THAT KILLING TERRORISTS  IS KIND OF YOUR THANG. [LAUGHTER] BUT STILL DOES NOT FULLY EXPLAIN  THE COLOSSAL CONFUSION FUELED  [BLEEPED] UPS THAT WERE  BENGHAZI. AS LONG AS ROMNEY DOESN'T WALK  INTO SOME NITPICKY SEMANTIC TRAP  THAT HADN'T EVEN REALLY BEEN  SEND...
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THE  PRESIDENT SAID ON THE DAY AFTER  THE ATTACK HE WENT IN THE ROSE GARDEN AND SAID THAT THIS WAS AN  ACT OF TERROR.
Jon: OH, BOY.
YOU SAID IN THE ROSE GARDEN  AFTER THE ATTACK IT WAS AN ACT  OF TERROR. IT WAS NOT A CORRESPONDENT  UTAHNIOUS DEMONSTRATION, IS THAT  WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
PLEASE PROCEED, GOVERNOR. [AUDIENCE REACTS] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: THERE'S YOUR FIRST  CLUE. WHEN YOU FEEL YOU'RE ABOUT TO  SPRING WHAT YOU, GOVERNOR  ROMNEY, THINK IS THE CHECKMATE  MOMENT OF THE DEBATE, AND YOUR DEBATE OPPONENT SAYS TO YOU,  "PLEASE, PROCEED," HOLD ON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ARE YOU TRYING TO OPEN THAT  DOOR? ALLOW ME TO OPEN IT WIDER. THE DOOR THAT YOU APPEAR TO WANT  TO WALK THROUGH. BUT WHEN YOUR OPPONENT DOES,  THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A  BREATH AND WONDER IF WILEY  COYOTE AND THE ROAD RUNNER, THAT DOOR YOUR OPPONENT IS POINTING  TO, IS MERELY PAINT ON A ROCK.
PLEASE PROCEED, GOVERNOR
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET  THAT FOR THE RECORD BECAUSE IT TOOK THE PRESIDENT 14 DAYS  BEFORE HE CALLED THE ATTACK IN  BENGHAZI AN ACT OF TERROR.
GET THE TRANSCRIPT.
HE DID, IN FACT, SIR. SO LET ME CALL IT AN ACT OF  TERROR.
CAN YOU SAY THAT A LITTLE  LOUDER, CANDY?
HE DID CALL IT AN ACT OF  TERROR. IT DID, AS WELL... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: CAN YOU SAY IT A  LITTLE LOUDER, CANDY. CAN YOU SAY IT A LITTLE LOUD  CENTER NOW JUST THE LADIES. CAN THE LADIES SAY IT? CAN I GET A WOOT-WOOT. PLEASE, GOVERNOR ROMNEY,  PROCEED. IT WAS THAT KIND OF NIGHT FOR  ROMNEY. THE EVIDENCE OF OBAMA'S VICTORY  AND RESURGENCE WAS EVERYWHERE  POST DEBATE, MSNBC NO LONGER  SEEMED SUICIDAL. CNN, OF COURSE, LOOKED TO BE  SHOOTING A VIRTUAL DICK IN A BOX  VIDEO, AND... [APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, FOX NEWS, WELL...
AND THE QUESTIONS, THERE WERE  11 OF THEM. SIX WERE CLEAR PRO-OBAMA.
THEY WERE SOFTBALLS.
TOPICS WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH  ABOUT.
THREE EXTRA MINUTES FOR  OBAMA.
MODERATORS IN THESE DEBATES  SHOULD BE PART OF THE FURNITURE.
DID SHE ASSIST THE PRESIDENT?
MID-SENTENCE TO FACT CHECK  HIM.
THE THAT'S THE WORST DEBATE  MODERATION.
WHAT THE HECK IS THAT ABOUT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, DON'T HELP  THEM. JUST LET THEM CRY THEMSELVES TO  SLEEP. [LAUGHTER] THE ONLY WAY THEY'LL LEARN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
