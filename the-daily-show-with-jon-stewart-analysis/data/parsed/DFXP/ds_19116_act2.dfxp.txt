Jon: WELCOME BACK. YESTERDAY, JUST YESTERDAY... YESTERDAY THE NCAA SETTLED A LAWSUIT WITH FORMER COLLEGE BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO WERE SEEKING COMPENSATION FOR THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT THE NCAA HAD MADE OFF THEIR LIKENESS AND VIDEO GAMES. SO NOW THE NCAA ADVANCES IN THE BRACKET TO THEIR NEXT LAWSUIT. BUT WHERE WILL IT END? WITH FAIRLY COMPENSATING ATHLETES FOR THE UNGODLY AMOUNTS OF MONEY THEY BRING INTO THE NCAA? I HOPE NOT. THIS IS AMERICA. HOW FAR CAN IT GO? JORDAN KLEPPER HAS MORE.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS THE LAST BASTION OF SPORTS AMATEURISM, WHERE STUDENT-ATHLETES PLAY FOR THE LOVE OF THE -- OH, DAMN, DID YOU SEE THAT HIT? HE GOT CRUSHED! BUT NOW THIS SPORT IS BEING RUINED BY PLAYERS LIKE KAIN COLTER, SEEN HERE SELFISHLY RITE WRITHING ON THE GROUND, WHO INSIST THEY DESERVE MORE.
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW NOT ONE PENNY IS GUARANTEED TO PAY FOR OUR MEDICAL EXPENSES. YOU HEAR ALL THESE HORROR STORIES ABOUT PLAYERS LOSING THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS WHEN THEY'VE BEEN INJURED. WHAT ARE THESE KIDS GOING DO?
THEY SHOULD GET A SECOND JOB.
WE ALREADY HAVE FALL-TIME JOB. WE DON'T HAVE TIME GET A SECOND JOB.
OK, WELL THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST SELL KAIN COLTER JERSEYS, MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH.
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PROFIT OFF YOUR LIKENESS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST JOIN ANOTHER LEAGUE?
THERE IS NO OTHER LEAGUE.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS.
UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THOSE EXPENSES DOWN THE ROAD ARE GONNA BE COMING OUT OF OUR OWN POCKET EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW, WE SUFFERED THE INJURIES WEARING OUR SCHOOL'S COLORS.
DON'T YOU THINK WHEN YOU GO IN WITH BACK PAIN, THAT THAT DOCTOR INSTEAD OF MONEY WILL ACCEPT A NICE LITTLE ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW FUN IT WAS TO BEAT WISCONSIN?
WE DIDN'T BEAT WISCONSIN.
OH. WELL, THAT'S ON YOU. WHETHER IT'S COULTER AND OTHER COLLEGIATE ATHLETES ONCE AGAIN WHINING THAT THEY DESERVE A CUT OF NCAA PROFIT OR BRAND-NEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT LOSING THEIR ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE THEY PLAYED PICK-UP FOOTBALL WHILE SERVING IN THE MILITARY...
IT WAS JUST AN INTRAMURAL LEAGUE, YOU KNOW, TO BUILD CAMARADERIE BETWEEN TROOPS. I DIDN'T FIGURE THEY WOULD PENALIZE ME FOR THAT. BUT THEN COULTER DID SOMETHING TRULY DESPICABLE.
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY'S FOOTBALL TEAM IS ASKING TO BE REPRESENTED BY A LABOR UNION.
YES, A UNION. COULTER IS ACTUALLY TRYING CLAIM THAT HE'S AN EMPLOYEE OF THE UNIVERSITY. CLEARLY THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOULD STICK TO FOOTBALL.
FUMBLE, FUMBLE. FUMBLE.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
YOU OKAY? >>YEAH. I'M GOOD.
YOU'RE NOT AN EMPLOYEE. YOU'RE A FOOTBALL PLAYER.
NO, WE ARE EMPLOYEES. JUST LIKE THE NFL PLAYERS ARE EMPLOYEES, COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARE EMPLOYEES.
AN EMPLOYEE HAS TO SIGN A CONTRACT.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYERS SIGN ONE-YEAR TENDER AGREEMENTS FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP.
ALRIGHT, WELL, EMPLOYEES HAVE TO WORK LIKE 40 HOURS A WEEK.
WE SPEND 50 TO 60 HOURS A WEEK PRACTICING IN THE OFF SEASON.
WELL, EMPLOYEES GET COMPENSATION.
WE'RE COMPENSATED IN THE FORM OF A SCHOLARSHIP, ROOM, TUITION AND BOARD.
EMPLOYEES DON'T LIVE IN DORMS. [LAUGHTER] OH. OH, GOTCHA. MEANWHILE, TRUE COLLEGE FOOTBALL FANS LIKE REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST DEE DEE BENKIE UNDERSTAND THAT TO OFFER THE PLAYERS COMPENSATION OF ANY KIND WOULD DESTROY THIS BELOVED SPORT.
FUMBLE. FUMBLE. FUMBLE.
THEY GET FREE ROOM AND BOARD, A FREE EDUCATION AND THEY'RE PLAYING THE GAME THEY LOVE. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH?
THESE GUYS ARE GETTING FREE WATER ON THE SIDELINES.
EXACTLY.
FREE GATORADE.
YES.
FREE TRIPS ON THE LITTLE CART THAT TAKES YOU TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
WELL, THAT'S UP TO THEM. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL, THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE. THESE FOOTBALL PLAYERS SHOULD BE PLAYING FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME.
EXACTLY. TAKE A LESSON FROM THE NCAA AND THEIR SPONSORS WHO PUT ON THEIR ANNUAL BOWL GAME SERIES FOR THE LOVE OF THE -- WAIT. WHO THE [BLEEPED] IS BEEF 'O' BRADY? OK, MAYBE THE NCAA DOES MAKE $11 BILLION A YEAR, BUT UNIONS ARE NOT THE ANSWER. SAYS THE NCAA.
USING A UNION EMPLOYEE MODEL STRIKES MOST PEOPLE AS GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.
AND THESE PLAYERS HAD NO IDEA HOW INAPPROPRIATE.
WHAT ARE THESE FOOTBALL PLAYERS GOING TO DO IF THEY UNIONIZE? DO THEY GET A MANDATORY SMOKE BREAK EVERY HOUR? WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY STRIKE? UNIONS ARE OVERBEARING. THEY'RE WORTHLESS. THEY WANT TO CONTROL EVERYTHING. THEY JUST TRY TO BE MONEY GRABBING LOSERS AND TRY TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF HARD-WORKING AMERICANS' POCKETS.
DEE DEE, THE CREW IS UNION, SO THEY CONTROL... THE PLAYERS ARE DETERMINED TO TAKE THIS TO THE COURT, FORCING CRITICS LIKE BENKIE TO SEE THAT, OKAY, MAYBE THESE PLAYERS SHOULD GET A SMALL, SMALL, TINY SLICE OF THE PIE.
THE NCAA, THEY HAVE A TON OF CASH. THEY NEED TO BEEF UP THE SCHOLARSHIPS. I AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK MOST PEOPLE DO.
THEY NEED TO BEEF UP THE SCHOLARSHIPS A LITTLE BIT. THEY JUST NEED SOME GROUP THAT COULD MAYBE COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN ON THEIR BEHALF.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT. NO. KEEP THE UNIONS OUT OF IT.
KEEP THE UNIONS OUT OF IT. NOW IS THE TIME TO SHOW COLTER WHAT UNIONIZED COLLEGE FOOTBALL WOULD REALLY LOOK LIKE.
WHOA, YOU DON'T RUN ALL THE WAY. YOU ARE 40 TO 30, YOU HAND IT OFF TO MY MAN HERE, HE'S 30 TO 20.
A GAME THAT'S NOTHING BUT HALF-ASS WORK PUNCTUATED BY SMOKE BREAKS.
SLOW DOWN! SLOW DOWN! THIS TEAM GETS PAID BY THE HOUR. GIVE IT TO YOUR LOCAL TENS.  FILL OUT YOUR W-9s AND LET THE END ZONE DANCING LOCAL 20 FINISH THE JOB.
HEY, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
