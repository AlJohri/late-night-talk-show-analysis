HEY, WELCOME BACK, WELCOME TO  THE SHOW. MY GUESTS TONIGHT, WILL SE THE  HEAD OF THE U.N. AGENCY IN  JORDAN, BASED AT THE REFUGEE CAMP ON THE SYRIAN BORDER,  ANDREW HARPER!
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
Stewart: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR COMING IN TO JOIN US. YOU DO GRIM YET INCREDIBLY  IMPORTANT WORK. TELL ME, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ARGUE  ALL DAY ABOUT THE POLITICS OF  ASSAD AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND SHOULD WE INTERVENE, SHOULD WE  NOT?  THERE IS NO ARGUMENT ABOUT  THE HUMANITARIAN DISASTER THAT HAS UNFOLDED IN THIS REGION AND  CAN YOU GIVE US A BRIEF UPDATE  ON THAT?
WELL, THANKS, JON, ALSO THANK  YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE  OPPORTUNITY TO TALK BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH  DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POLITICS,  THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH  DISCUSSION ABOUT SECURITY, BUT WHAT IS CONTINUALLY FORGOTTEN IN  ALL OF THESE CONFLICTS IS WHAT  IS HAPPENING TO THE SYRIANS, AND TODAY WE MARK 2 MILLION REFUGEES  HAVING FLED ACROSS THE BORDER  INTO JORDAN, INTO TURKEY, INTO IRAQ, INTO LEBANON, AND THIS IS  THE TRAGEDY, ON TOP OF THAT YOU  HAVE GOT 5 MILLION, AND THESE ARE NUMBERS WHICH NO ONE CAN  REALLY COMPREHEND BECAUSE EACH  ONE OF THESE REFUGEES, EACH ONE OF THESE PERSONS HAVE BASICALLY  FLED THEIR HOMES.
Stewart: RIGHT.
AND NO ONE WANTS TO FLEE  THEIR HOMES BUT THEY FLED  BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN BOMBED, THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO  SERVICES, AND THEY HAVE LEFT  WITH ALMOST NOTHING BUT OFTEN THE CLOTHES THAT ARE ON THEIR  BACK, CHILDREN HAVE OFTEN HAD TO  FLEE THEIR HOMES WHICH ARE BEING BOMBED AND THE AMOUNT OF  CHILDREN.
Stewart: AND THE AMOUNT OF  WOMEN IS ASTONISHING.
LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO WE  HIT 1 MILLION CHILDREN HAVING  FLED ACROSS THE BORDER, AND THESE NUMBERS ARE JUST NUMBERS  WHEN THEY ARE REPORTED IN THE  PRESS, BUT WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY WORKING WITH REFUGEES OR WORKING  WITH THE DISPLACED THEN EACH ONE  OF THESE INDIVIDUALS NEEDS HELP, EACH ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS  NEEDS PROTECTION AND THE FIRST  THING WE WITH HAVE TO DO IS SAY THANK YOU AS YOU DID IN YOUR  INTRODUCTION SAY THANK YOU TO  THE COUNTRIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST WHO HAVE OFTEN ARE STRUGGLING  PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THEIR OWN  COMMUNITY AND POPULATION AND THEY HAVE THIS WONDERFUL  TRADITION AND CULTURE OF  PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THOSE IN  CONFLICTS.
JORDAN, FOR INSTANCE,  POPULATION OF 6 MILLION,  2 MILLION PALESTINIANS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND OF IRAQ IRS AND NOW  THE SYRIANS AND THESE ARE  COUNTRIES THAT BASICALLY OPENED THEIR DOORS, JORDAN HAS NO OIL.
Stewart: RIGHT OR WATER.
OR WATER.
Stewart: RIGHT.
AND BASICALLY HAVE TO ABSORB  WHAT IS BASICALLY AN  INTERNATIONAL DISASTER.
Stewart: RIGHT.
IT IS NOT JUST A HUMANITARIAN  DISASTER, OR REGIONAL, THIS IS  AN INTERNATIONAL DISASTER.
Stewart: AND IT IS THE  POINT OF THE U.N. PEOPLE DON'T  QUITE -- THE PART OF THE U.N. YOU SORT OF UNDERSTAND IS THE  MORE THEATRICAL, YOU KNOW, HUGO  CHAVEZ AT THE U.N. GIVING A SPEECH ABOUT SULFUR OR WHATEVER  THAT IS OR, YOU KNOW, PUTTING  LIBYA ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONS OR THOSE TYPE OF  THINGS, THERE IS THIS WHOLE  OTHER AVENUE OF THE U.N., BOOTS ON THE GROUND PEOPLE LIKE  YOURSELF DOING THIS INCREDIBLE  DAY TO DAY WORK EFFECTIVELY, EFFICIENTLY, IN A MANNER THAN IS  ASTONISHING TO SEE. I MEAN I WANT TO SHOW, HERE IS A  PICTURE OF THE CAMP A YEAR AGO. OKAY?  THIS IS DESERT IN  NORTHERN JORDAN, DESERT.
THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT  GAVE TO START WITH, AND THIS IS  -- YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE MONITORS, THESE ARE THE FOLKS  COMING OVER, THESE ARE SOME  REFUGEES, FROM IRAQ, ABOUT 45,000 CROSS GOOD IRAQ LAST  WEEK, THIS IS ONE WEEK.
Stewart:.
YES. SO THIS IS THE CAMP MORE  RECENTLY, NOW. THIS IS IN THE DESERT AREA, IT  IS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT, IT IS  120,000 PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THERE AND HERE JUST TO GIVE YOU  A SENSE, THOUGH OF SOME OPTIMISM  WITHIN THIS I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE OF WHAT HE CALL THE  CHAMPS.
THERE ARE GUYS COOKING  CHICKEN ON THE LEFT. THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAT HAS  CREATED SORT OF SOME SEMBLANCE  OF NORMALCY AND COMMERCE WITHIN THIS REALLY DIFFICULT CONDITION.
WELL, WHAT WET HAVE SEEN IS  ALMOST LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE  2 MILLION PEOPLE MOVE ACT CROSS THE BORDER, BASICALLY EQUATES TO  WHOLE POPULATIONS LEAVING.
Stewart: RIGHT.
TOWNS, VILLAGES, WE PROBABLY  HAVE GOT HALF OF THE POPULATION  OF DARA THAT MOVED INTO JORDAN.
Stewart: JORDAN IN TERMS OF  DARA VALLEY IS BASICALLY THE  SAME SORT OF FAMILIES.
YES.
LIKE EAST OR WEST GERMANY.
YES.
SO THEY HAVE ABSORBED 350,000  JUST IN THE HOME, THIS CAMP IS  JUST FOR THE POOREST OF THE POOR WHO DIDN'T HAVE THOSE  HOSPITALITY --
JORDAN TRIED TO AVOID HAVING  CAMPS AND TO ITS CREDIT, LIKE IT  NEVER WANTED TO PUT PEOPLE IN  CAMPS. NO ONE WANTS TO BE IN A REFUGEE  CAMP. NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO BE IN A  REFUGEE CAMP FOR THE FIRST ONE,  TWO, 300,000 PEOPLE, IT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO COME IN AND ABSORBED  WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, BUT THE  COMMUNITIES COULD NO LONGER ABSORB THEM BECAUSE YOU WOULD  HAVE CITIES SUCH AS NORTH OF  JORDAN, 200,000 MORE REFUGEES ARRIVED THERE.
Stewart: AND THESE ARE  WORKERS AND THEY WANT -- PEOPLE  WILL HIRE THEM FOR LOWER AND PUTS PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY. WILL YOU STICK AROUND AND TALK A  LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT ON THE  WEB?
I APPRECIATE THAT.
Stewart: IS THERE ANYTHING  PEOPLE CAN DO?  CAN THEY DONATE?
FIRSTLY I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO  SAY AS I AM IN THE STATES I  WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE U.S. PEOPLE AS WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE  BEEN THE BIGGEST AND MOST  GENEROUS DONORS TO THE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE AND THIS  IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD SEE UNDER  THE RADAR, IT IS FANTASTIC CONTRIBUTION SO FAR BUT WHAT WE  HAVE SEEN IS WE HAVE ALMOST AN  OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF REFUGEES CROSS THE BORDERS, WE HAVEN'T  BEEN OVERWHELMED WE WOULD NOT BE  OVERWHELMED BUT WE DO NEED THE MONEY TO CONTINUE THE WORK.
Stewart: SO IF YOU ARE  INTERESTING YOU CAN DONATE TO  THE U.N. EFFORT IN JORDAN AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD,  UN REFUGEES.ORG, ANDREW HARPER,  WE WILL BE RIGHT
