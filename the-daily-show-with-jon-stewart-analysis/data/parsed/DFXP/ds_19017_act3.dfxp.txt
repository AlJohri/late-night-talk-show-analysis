[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT AND COFOUNDER OF THE BOB WOODRUFF FOUNDATION. THEIR ANNUAL BENEFIT STAND UP FOR HEROES TAKING PLACE IN NEW YORK CITY THIS WEDNESDAY. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BOB WOODRUFF. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jon: HOW MANY YEARS NOW? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WOODRUFF FOUNDATION, HOW MANY YEARS HAS THIS THING BEEN GOING ON?
SEVENTH YEAR.
Jon: AND YOU'VE RAISED HOW MUCH MONEY IN THAT TIME?
ALMOST 20 MILLION BUCKS.
Jon: ALMOST $20 MILLION. AND OUT OF THAT [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- OUT OF THAT WHAT IS YOUR CUT? [LAUGHTER]
67%.
Jon: THAT'S A SMART CHOICE. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DO. THE FACILITIES THERE. EXPLAIN VERY QUICKLY IT'S FOR PTSD, RESEARCH INTO BRAIN INJURY, THESE TYPES OF THINGS, YES?
A LOT OF IT IS THIS TRANSITION. EARLY ON WE HAVE SO MUCH ATTENTION FOR THOSE IN ICU, THOSE WHO COME BACK FROM THE WARS AND NEED MEDICAL CARE, THEN THEY GO BACK TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. WE HAVE TO WORK OUT THAT TRANSITION WHEN THEY GO TO THE NEW WORLD FOR THEM AND THERE'S CREATIVE AND NEW ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE NOW FUNDING, THE ONES THAT ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND TRY TO HELP THEM THE MOST YOU POSSIBLY CAN AND GET THE MONEY TO REALLY BE WELL SPENT. PUT IT THAT WAY.
Jon: GIVE ME AN IDEA OF A PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE FOUND THAT IS EFFECTIVE AND KIND OF LIKE A GOOD MODEL FOR THIS TYPE OFKE A TRANSITION.
WELL, THERE'S ONE MUSIC CORE IS ONE. YOU'LL SEE THIS AT THE EVENT AS WELL. IT'S STARTED BY A GREAT MUSICIAN WHO IS A PIANIST AND HE HAS REALIZED THAT MUSIC  IS A THERAPY FOR THESE GUYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY NEED THIS FOR A LONGER PART OF THEIR LIFE WHEN THEY GET OUT AND THEY CAN DO THAT IN THE LOCAL AREAS. THERE'S PROGRAMS WE'VE GOT. WHEN THE KID GO BACK -- THESE MEN -- GO BACK TO COLLEGE AND GET THEIR GI BILL. THE GI BILL YOU CAN GET BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SUDDENLY HAVE TO DROP OUT AND YOU CAN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE IT'S A NEW WORLD FOR YOU?  THE ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. THEY GET IN THERE WITH A LAWYER. THEY CAN WORK YOU THROUGH THE ISSUES THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH. ONE GUY WENT THROUGH THAT. HE THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER COME BACK BUT HE HAS A JOB.
Jon: ARE THEY LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ISSUES VETERANS FACE. YOU HAVE PTSD ISSUES AT TIMES. YOU HAVE THIS LOSS OF CAMARADERIE AND SENSE OF PURPOSE THAT, I THINK, CAN BE INCREDIBLY DEBILITATING TO BE AWAY FROM YOUR PLATOON WITHOUT THAT IDEA OF DIRECTION CAN BE INCREDIBLY ISOLATING.
THERE'S A DICTION AND A SIMPLE, LIFE GETS MORE SIMPLER WHEN YOU ARE IN THE WAR ZONE AND YOU HAVE X TO ACCOMPLISH. YOU HAVE THIS AS YOUR SCHEDULE AND AS YOU SAID, YOUR FRIENDS YOU ARE STILL CLOSE WITH. THEN YOU GO BACK TO THE CIVILIAN WORLD. THIS GIGANTIC WORLD. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT DAY WHEN YOU COME BACK. AND IF YOU ADD TO THAT SOME KIND OF WOUNDS WHETHER IT'S VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE AND IMAGINE HOW IT IS TO ADJUST FROM THAT?
Jon: IT'S HARD FOR ANYBODY TO ADJUST. YOU FIND MAYORS OF BIG CITIES.
THEY DON'T LIKE TO SMOKE CRACK.
Jon: A MAYOR OF A MAJOR CITY.
STAY AWAY FROM THAT.
Jon: YOU ARE DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REPORTING. YOU HAVE A STORY. SOMETHING COOKING FOR US?
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM COLOMBIA TO CHECK OUT THE EMERALD INDUSTRY.
Jon: RIGHT THE EMERALD INDUSTRY, YEAH, YEAH. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE. WE'RE GOING TO  COLOMBIA TO LOOK AT EMERALDS. I HEAR YOU.
I GOT ONE FOR MY WIFE.
Jon: REALLY?
I DIDN'T FIND IT THOUGH.
Jon: EMERALD. HOW BIG IS THE EMERALD INDUSTRY IN COLOMBIA?
IT'S HUGE. IT'S NUMBER TWO BEHIND RUBIES.
Jon: I THOUGHT ZAMBIA.
COLOMBIA USED TO PRODUCE 80% OR 90% OF THE WORLD'S EMERALDS. ZAMBIA IS INVOLVED AND THEY TOOK A LOT A WAY.
Jon: ISN'T IT SURPRISING I KNEW ZAMBIA OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. IT'S ALMOST LIKE I WAS TALKING TO YOU BACK STAGE.
YES. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN I POINT OUT THIS --
Jon: PLEASE.
I KNOW ANYBODY CAN COME ON WEDNESDAY BUT YOU CAN WATCH THIS -- YOU CAN ACTUALLY LIVE STREAMED. YOU CAN WATCH BRUCE.
Jon: BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IS COMING BACK. HE IS A TERRIFIC YOUNG KID AND I THINK HE WILL DO WELL.
HE'S NEW TO IT. NOT LOCAL BUT HE IS GOOD AND ROGER WATERS.
Jon: PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF 20 GUYS, A BAND OF VETERANS, THEY PERFORMED LAST YEAR. BLEW THE HOUSE AWAY. KILLED IT. THEY WERE SO GOOD.
YOU CAN WATCH IT AND IF YOU ARE NOT GOING YOU CAN SEE IT. CHEVON PHILIPS IS HERE. A SERGEANT IN THE MARINES BADLY INJURED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND HIS AMAZING MOTHER RIGHT NEXT TO HIM GAIL. THEY'VE BEEN HERE ALMOST EVERY YEAR FOR EVENT. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
Jon: I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CHATTING LATER. IT'S ALWAYS SUCH A GREAT NIGHT. IT'S A GREAT EVENT.
YOU'VE BEEN THERE EVERY YEAR. YOU KNOW IT AND YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH --
Jon: I ENJOY IT. WE ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT TIME. I GET WAY MORE OUT OF IT THAN I EVER GIVE.
THIS YEAR NO CRACK.
Jon: NO CRACK?
NOTHING FOR YOU.
Jon: DIDN'T YOU READ MY GREEN ROOM RIDER. I GET GREEN M&MS AND CRACK.
YOU CAN RUN FOR MAYOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
