(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK. EVERY SO OFTEN A NEWS ANCHOR END UP BECOMING THE STORY. DAN RATHER BEING ROUGHED UP ON THE FLOOR OF THE '68 DEMOCRAT QUICK CONVENTION. MARV ALBERT HAVING A SEX SCANDAL. BARBARA WALTERS CAUSING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HINDENBURG. (LAUGHTER) WHY? WHY BARBARA? WHY DO YOU KILL? LATELY WATCHING CNN I'VE NOTICED SOMETHING NEWSWORTHY MAY BE BREWING THERE AS WELL.
ONE GROUP CALCULATED HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO GO TO HOG WARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY.
MORE THAN $43,000 AND THAT'S FOR ONLY ONE YEAR. TUITION IS ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST CHUNK. JUST TO SEND YOUR KID OFF TO BECOME A WIZARD, IT'S GOING TO PRICE IT RIGHT OUT OF THE  BALLPARK I SAY.
I'D SAY IT COSTS ZERO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EXIST.
THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER)
VICTIM DONE THE CALCULATIONS FOR YOU. RIGHT AT THE TOP. IT IS INTERESTING, THOUGH.
Jon: DID YOU SEE THAT? HIS HALF-HEARTED LAST MINUTE EFFORT TO FEIGN THAT HE CARES AT ALL ABOUT WHAT THAT WOMAN WAS  TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S NOT JUST CASUAL ANCHOR BANTER, MY FRIENDS. THAT'S A CALL FOR HELP. AS WE EXPLORE IN OUR NEW SEGMENT, CNN ANCHOR DON LENNON APPEARS NOT TO CARE FOR CNN. CNN UNCONCERNED. IT APPEARS YOUR ANCHOR DON LEMON MAY NOT CARE VERY MUCH FOR THE ANTICS OF YOUR NETWORK CNN. BEHOLD. EVEN PARTS OF CANADA ARE SINFULLY HOT. A LITTLE WARMER UP HERE THAN WHERE I'M USED TO, BUT, HELL. THIS IS NOTHING TO JOKE ABOUT THIS. IT IS DANGEROUS AND, AS I SAID, NOTHING TO JOKE.
HE IS THE KATO TO MY GREEN HORNET. THE ROBIN TO MY BAT MAN. THE DINO GIRL TO MY ELECTROWOMAN. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO ANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE EXCEPT FOR BATMAN.
Jon: THAT MAY BE THE NICEST WAY I'VE EVER HEARD ANYONE SAY  "WHO WRITE THIS IS (BLEEP)?" (LAUGHTER) BUT THE HOSTAGE SITUATION THAT  APPEARS TO BE DON LEMON'S TENURE AT CNN REACHED ITS... DO YOU SAY ZENITH OR NADER? I'M GOING TO SAY BOTH.
ONE, TWO, THREE!
OH!
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I LIKE DON LEMON A LOT BUT HE'S GOING  TO HAVE TO WORK HARD TO TOP THAT. CNN NEWSROOM BEGINS WITH DON LEMON. GOOD MORNING, DON.
GOOD MORNING. I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK THAT HARD. WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? THAT WAS ALI VELSHI'S DOPPELGANGER BEING KNOCKED INTO A GLASS OF WATER FROM A TOILET  PAPER TUBE. WHAT IS IT YOUR FIRST DAY IN NEWS, LEMON? TURNS OUT REPORTER DON LEMON PREFERS REPORTING SUCH STORIES AS THE UPRISING IN SYRIA, BREACH  OF TRUST IN BRITISH JOURNALISM OR EVEN SOME SIMPLE LOCAL INTEREST STORIES.
EMILY GOOD SAYS SHE RECORDED THAT VIDEO IN HER FRONT YARD BECAUSE SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT  RACIAL PROFILING AND POLICE HARASSMENT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM WITH ROCHESTER POLICE?
Jon: THAT'S LEMON'S COMFORT ZONE. DON'T WORRY, I'M SURE CNN PRODUCERS ARE HARD AT WORK TRYING TO FIT DON LEMON INTO  THEIR FORMAT WITH SOMETHING CATCHY LIKE "DON LEMON'S ZESTY NEWS BOWL." (LAUGHTER)  I GOT ONE, HOW ABOUT "T LEMON HARANGUE?" (LAUGHTER) YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, SIR!
