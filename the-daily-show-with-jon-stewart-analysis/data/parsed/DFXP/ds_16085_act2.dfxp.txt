Jon: WELCOME BACK. MADE... MADE... MADE IN AMERICA USED TO MEAN SOMETHING. MOSTLY THAT WE HAD JOBS. [LAUGHTER] HERE IN AMERICA. BUT WITH SO MANY OF THESE JOBS GOING OVERSEAS, AMERICA HAS BUT ONE CHOICE. JASON JONES HAS MORE.
FOR YEARS AMERICA FACED A GREAT THREAT.
SOCIALISM IS COMING OUR WAY.
WE WANT TO GO TO IRAQ.
DO WE REALLY WANT TO CHANGE AMERICA INTO SWEDEN?
BUT WHEN SWEDEN OPENED UP AN IKEA FACTORY IN VIRGINIA, SOCIALISM BECAME THE LEAST OF OUR WORRIES.
WHEN THEY FIRST SHOWED UP IN DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, WE THOUGHT, THIS IS IKEA, THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST, BUT WORKERS ARE DISRESPECTED. THEY'RE ABUSED. THEY DON'T GET CORRECT TRAINING. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THEY'RE NOT PAID ENOUGH. THEY'RE TREATING THESE WORKERS AS IF IT'S A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.
TO FIND OUT MORE, I MET SWEDISH BUSINESS EXPERT LARS BARGAINS. WELCOME.
THANK YOU.
IN A ROOM FILLED WITH THE COMFORTS OF HIS HOMELAND. HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE.
OH.
I THINK THERE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT SWEDEN WHICH WE HAVE TO CORRECT. WE FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN CAPITALISTS AND VERY GOOD AT IT, BUT IT'S TRUE THAT WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THE MASTERS. NOW YOU'RE WORKING FOR US, WHICH IS THE WAY IT TURNS AROUND.
GOD, LOOK AT YOU, SO SMUG.
YOU THINK I'M SMUG.
A LITTLE BIT.
LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
WE USED TO BE THAT SMUG. HOW DO WE GET TO BE THAT SMUG AGAIN?
I THINK THAT'S THE $1 MILLION QUESTION.
SWEDEN WAS EVERYTHING WE USED TO BE. [DANCING QUEEN PLAYING] DOMINANT, ARROGANT AND SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL. BUT IF SWEDEN WAS US, WHO WERE WE?
WE HAVE, IN FACT, BECOME SWEDEN'S MEXICO.
REALLY?
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT IF WE WANT TO WORK, WE GOT TO BE SOMEBODY'S MEXICO.
IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE CHOICE IN AMERICA IS TO WORK FOR  DANGEROUS WORK, DISRESPECTFUL WORK, DEGRADING WORK AT MINIMUM WAGE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THEN MY STATEMENT TO YOU, SIR, IS THAT IS UNAMERICAN.
EXACTLY. IT'S MEXICAN.
HAVE YOU BEEN TO A MEXICAN FACTORY?
YES.
THEY HAVE BRUTAL WORK CONDITIONS, LONG HOURS, LOW PAY. [INAUDIBLE] THE WATER SUPPLY COMES FROM THE EFFLUENT FROM THE FACTORY.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
WHICH ONE WERE YOU AT?
THE ONE IN MY HEAD. AND THE PROBLEM IS OUR AMERICAN-RUN AMERICAN FACTORIES LIKE THIS ONE CAN'T COMPETE WITH  OUR SWEDISH-RUN MEXICAN FACTORIES. THESE GUYS SEEM LIKE COMPLETE WASTES. THE CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE ASSEMBLING IT THEMSELVES.
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT.
IT'S CALLED AN ALLEN WRENCH.
WELL, THERE'S YOUR FIRST PROBLEM. IT'S COMFORTABLE.
THEY CODDLED THEIR EMPLOYEE AT EVERY TURN.
WHEN DOES THIS GUY GET HIS BATHROOM BREAK?
BATHROOM BREAK?
YEAH.
WHENEVER HE HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
OH, WELL, THAT'S JUST STUPID.
WELL, I GUESS WE JUST...
IF FACTORIES LIKE THIS HOPE TO SURVIVE, THEY'LL HAVE TO MODERNIZE.
IT'S CLASSIC. YOU'LL HAVE IT FOR A LIFETIME. IT'S GREAT STYLE. I THINK THE ANTIQUE FINISH...
WHOA, WHOA, $1,700, NO THANK YOU. IKEA GIVES ME THAT FOR $19.99 PLUS THEY'LL THROW IN AN EKTORP.
WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THROW AN EKTORP WITH IT?
NO.
WHAT ABOUT A STRONUS?
NO.
MELTROP?
NO.
DING DONG?
NO. WHAT?
WHAT UNION ADVOCATES DON'T GET IS IF IT'S NOT SWEDEN, IT WILL BE SOMEONE ELSE.
UNTIL WE GET RECOGNIZE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS THE UNION  FOR DANVILLE, THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE.
IF YOU UNIONIZE, IKEA CAN SHIP DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA, AND  THOSE PEOPLE WORK FOR PORK RINDS AND HORSE VAGINAS.
HORSE HAVE A EYE -- VAGINAS.
BOTTOM LINE, WE NEED TO LEARN A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON FROM OUR SWEDISH OVERLORDS.
THESE ARE BUSINESS PEOPLE. THEY DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO MAKE A BUCK.
OKAY.
OH, GOD DAMN THIS FURNITURE IS SO CHEAP.
JASON
