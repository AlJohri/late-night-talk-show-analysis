Jon: THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
I TRIED TO INVEST PART OF MYSELF. I TRY TO INVEST PART OF MYSELF IN EVERYTHING I WRITE. INCIDENTALLY, I'VE... THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE...
Jon: YOU HAVE OTHER NOVELS, FICTION?

HERE'S THE THING. THIS IS A VERY, VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
I FELT I WAS THE ONE... I FELT COMPELLED TO BE THE ONE TO BRING IT TO THE FOREFRONT. (LAUGHTER) TO EMBRACE IT. AND TAVIS WAS NICE ENOUGH...
Jon: STAPH VISION SMILEY, HE WROTE THE INTRO?
TAVIS SMILEY WROTE THE INTRODUCTION.
Jon: JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY. IS THAT YOUR HAND? ARE YOU IN BLACK HAND FOR THIS BOOK? BECAUSE THAT'S... (LAUGHTER).
NOW, SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
Jon: OH, OKAY. THAT'S AN INSENSITIVITY?
THAT'S THE UGLY PROBLEM I AM TRYING TO FACE. I HAVE ANOTHER BOOK THAT I WROTE.
Jon: OH, SURE, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD...
WHICH IS SORT OF ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, MAYBE I'M WRONG HERE, THIS ACTUALLY SAYS "BY ANONYMOUS" NOT... IS THIS... (LAUGHTER). SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO...
WE DON'T KNOW.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY PROLIFIC. HOW CAN... BECAUSE THESE ARE THREE PRETTY BIG BOOKS. HOW QUICKLY TO YOU WRITE THESE?
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW MANY PAGE THIS IS TURNED OUT TO BE. INCLUDING THE INDEX 277.
Jon: 277. THAT'S FAST.
I WROTE ANOTHER BOOK. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHEN DID YOU WRITE THIS BOOK?
I WROTE THIS BOOK TODAY. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AMAZING. SEE HOW... LOOK AT HOW HOT IT IS. (LAUGHTER) NOW THAT IS THE SUIT YOU ARE WEARING TODAY BUT WITH A DIFFERENT TIE. THAT'S AMAZING. AND YOU JUST COMPLETED THAT THIS MORNING? THIS IS... OH, MY GOSH, THIS IS 270 PAGES. YOU'RE INCREDIBLE. YOU ARE INCREDIBLE.
I LIKE TO WRITE A LOT OF BOOKS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: IT'S...
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER BOOKS THAT I'VE BEEN READING. AND WRITING.
Jon: WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?
I'VE WRITTEN A BOOK... I BELIEVE WE HAVE IT SOMEWHERE...
Jon: IT'S AN AUDIO BOOK?
IT'S AN AUDIO BOOK.
Jon: LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. "50 SHADES OF YAMS." UH-HUH. (LAUGHTER)
NOW, REMEMBER, JON, REMEMBER I USED TO DO... I USED TO DO A SEGMENT ON THE SHOW CALLED  PRODUCE WITH STEVE CARELL.
Jon: IT WAS OUR MOST POPULAR SEGMENT.
I AM MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF OF THAT.
Jon: USING THIS BOOK. IS THERE GOING TO BE A FILM "50 SHADES OF YAMS" OR...
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
Jon: HOW DID YOU GET IAN McKEL LANN TO READ THAT?
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YEAH. I MEAN, THAT'S...
JON, I WROTE ANOTHER BOOK.
Jon: OH, OKAY. SURE.
I THINK WE HAVE THIS ONE, TOO. (LAUGHTER) IF YOU CAN SEE IT, IT'S... (LAUGHTER). WELL, I GUESS THAT'S FAIRLY SELF-EXPLANATORY. IT'S A BOOK... IT'S HOW I IMAGINE STEVE JOBS WOULD HAVE WRITTEN MY BIOGRAPHY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I GUESS THAT'S AN E-BOOK.
WELL DONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, SEE, I MEAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M VERY... YOU'RE RIGHT. MAYBE I DIDN'T PERHAPS NURTURE THAT ENOUGH WHEN YOU WERE HERE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
NO, NO, NO. YOU WERE VERY NURTURING, YOU WERE LOVELY. YOU WERE LOVELY, LOVELY MAN.
Jon: IT LOOKED LIKE YOU HAD WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THAT I HIT YOU.
THAT'S BY ANONYMOUS.
Jon: THAT'S NOT YOU.
NOT NECESSARILY.
Jon: IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE STEVE JOBS/STEVE CARELL BOOK THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THAT  COMES UP THAT'S DAMAGING TO ME?
SO YOU DIDN'T READ THESE BOOKS?
Jon: I DIDN'T READ THEM ALL.
I SENT THESE BOOKS TO YOU AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE TYPE OF  PERSON WHO DID THEIR HOME WORK BEFORE THE SHOW. CAUGHT YA! THAT'S A GOTCHA MOMENT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID DO. THE REASON THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO READ YOUR BOOKS TODAY WAS BECAUSE I SPENT THE DAY IN THE THEATER. A MOVIE THEATER. WATCHING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BRILLIANT GIFT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD. IT WAS A FILM STARRING A YOUNG MAN WHO LOOKED A LOT LIKE YOU.
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.
Jon: DON'T DO THIS.
STOP IT!
Jon: IT'S CALLED "SEEKING A FRIEND FOR TEND OF THE WORLD."  I'D LIKE TO SHOW A BRIEF CLIP IF I CAN.
I STILL DABBLE. I DABBLE. IF YOU WANT TO. I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: LET ME SHOW YOU A BRIEF CLIP.
WHERE DO I SEE THE MONITOR? WHICH ONE DO I LOOK AT?
IT COMES UP RIGHT THROUGH HERE.
SO...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?
OH, UM, A LITTLE OF THIS, LITTLE OF THAT. PROBABLY CATCHING UP ON SOME ME TIME. FIND GOD. MAYBE MOVE AROUND SOME CHAIRS.
WELL, MAYBE I'LL RUN INTO YOU AT A SUPPORT GROUP OR ORGY OR SOMETHING.
THAT SOUNDS NICE.
Jon: NICELY DONE. WELL, SO NICE TO SEE YOU. "SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD" IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. IF THE BOOKS DON'T WORK OUT I THINK YOU SHOULD PURSUE THE ACTING THING BECAUSE I SEE  SOMETHING THERE.
YOU'RE VERY KIND TO ME.
Jon: OH, STOP IT.
YOU'RE VERY GOOD.
Jon: STEVE CARELL, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
