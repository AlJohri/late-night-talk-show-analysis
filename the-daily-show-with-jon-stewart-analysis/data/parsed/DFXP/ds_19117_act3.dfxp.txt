WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK. JOINING US VIA SATELLITE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER. SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
HI, JON. GOOD TO BE HERE.
HEY, FIRST OF ALL, SENATOR, OBVIOUSLY THE GIANT NEWS DOWN THERE IS THAT ERIC CANTOR HAS LOST HIS SEAT. I KNOW THAT HE IS A REPUBLICAN, BUT HE'S ALSO JEWISH IN THAT INSTANCE. DO YOU AND DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ DO YOU, IF I MAY SAY, DO YOU POUR OUT A LITTLE MANISCHEWITZ FOR A HOMIE? IS ANYTHING THAT IS DONE THERE?
NOT MUCH. NO.
Jon: NOT MUCH. ALL RIGHT. NO LOVE LOST. NO HAMANTASCHEN. NOTHING. SO LISTEN, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO OBVIOUSLY BE JOINING US HERE IN NEW YORK. YOU HAD TO STAY DOWN IN D.C. BECAUSE OF A VOTE THAT WAS ANNOUNCED. WHAT, WHAT, WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
WELL, IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SMALL BITS OF GOOD NEWS THAT COMES OUT OF WASHINGTON. WE VOTED TO PUT MONEY INTO THE VETERANS' HOSPITALS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE READ ABOUT. THESE FOLKS WENT OVERSEAS, WERE INJURED, AND THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED AS BEST WE CAN. AND, THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IT WAS BIPARTISAN. BERNIE SANDERS, LIBERAL DEMOCRAT, JOHN MCCAIN, CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN GOT TOGETHER. SO, IT WAS A RARE GOOD MOMENT.
Jon: WHAT? THAT'S... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT'S EXCELLENT. NOW, IS THAT, IS THAT BILL... OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DETAILS OF THAT. IS THAT CALLED THE 2014 "OH MY GOD, WHAT TOOK US SO LONG" BILL?
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT, YES.
Jon: IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AT TIMES WHAT IT TAKES TO GET SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT. I MEAN, THIS SCANDAL IS ABOUT AS EGREGIOUS AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY GET.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: AND, HAS THIS TYPE OF FUNDING COME UP PREVIOUSLY AND NOT BEEN ABLE? OR IS, OR IS...
YES.
Jon: OR IS THE BUREAUCRACY SO SCREWED UP THAT IT WOULDN'T MATTER ANYWAY?
YEAH, WELL, NO. SENATOR SANDERS ACTUALLY HAD A BILL ON THE FLOOR A FEW MONTHS AGO AND IT WAS DEFEATED, BUT AFTER THE SCANDAL CAME ABOUT AND PEOPLE SAW HOW AWFUL THE TREATMENT WAS, IT WAS PASSED. AND, I'M GLAD IT WAS. WE WORKED HARD TO PASS IT THE FIRST TIME. WE FAILED. SOMETIMES IN WASHINGTON YOU GOT TO KEEP TRYING AND YOU CAN FINALLY GET SOMETHING DONE.
Jon: RIGHT. I THINK THE KEY WORD THERE WOULD BE "SOMETIMES." SO WHAT WHAT ELSE, WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON DOWN THERE? DO YOU HAVE... I KNOW THERE'S A COLLEGE LOAN PROPOSAL. THAT ALSO CAME UP TODAY.
WELL. WELL, YEAH THAT'S THE... THAT'S THE BAD NEWS. IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT WE DID NOT GET ENOUGH VOTES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TO PASS IT. IT WAS BLOCKED. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 40 MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE IN AMERICA, I'LL BET MANY ARE IN YOUR AUDIENCE, WHO OWE AN AVERAGE OF $30,000 IN STUDENT LOANS.
Jon: DID YOU JUST CALL MY AUDIENCE DEADBEATS?
NO. THEY'RE JUST TRYING SURVIVE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
Jon: BUT WHEN YOU SAY IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY THINK THIS WOULD PASS, DID YOU?
WELL, WE HOPED IT WOULD. THERE WAS SOME TALK THAT SOME ENOUGH REPUBLICANS WOULD JOIN US. ONLY THREE DID. BECAUSE IT'S SO OBVIOUS, THE GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY CHARGING YOUNG FAMILIES, YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST OUT OF COLLEGE DOUBLE THE GOING INTEREST RATE. INSTEAD OF THE 3.5% THEY SHOULD CHARGE, THEY'RE CHARGE 7%. THE PRIVATE BANKS ARE CHARGING UP TO 14%. SO PEOPLE WITH THIS HUGE BURDEN OF DEBT ON THEIR BACKS ARE PAYING MUCH MORE INTEREST THAN THEY HAVE TO. ALL WE WANT DO IS BRING IT DOWN TO THE 3.8% THAT IS THE GOING INTEREST RATE. YOU WOULD THINK EVERYBODY WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE FAIR AND GOOD THING TO DO.
Jon: RIGHT. THEY DIDN'T.. WASN'T THE OBJECTION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PAY FOR IT WITH THE BUFFETT RULE, WHICH EVEN YOU SAID IS A NON-STARTER. THAT'S NEVER GOING TO PASS.
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE A NON-STARTER. IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE INCOMES OF OVER $1 MILLION SHOULD PAY THE SAME TAX RATE AS MOST EVERYBODY ELSE PAYS, 30%, AND YOU SHOULDN'T USE THE LOOPHOLES. BUT WE TOLD THEM, IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO PAY FOR IT, GIVE US AN EXAMPLE. GIVE US SOMETHING TO WORK WITH. AND THEY DIDN'T. YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS THAT THE HARD RIGHT SAYS THEY DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT DOING ANYTHING, EVEN HELPING PEOPLE GET FAIR INTEREST RATE, A FAIR SHOT AT A GOOD INTEREST RATE. AND TOO MANY OF THE REPUBLICANS FOLLOW THEM.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT... THE OTHER PLAN I THINK IS THE PETTRY PLAN. IT'S A SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF AN OBAMA PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE THEIR PAYMENTS PRORATED TO THEIR INCOME AND THEN WITH A FORGIVENESS. THAT SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING PROPOSAL.
IT IS.
Jon: DOES THAT HAVE ANY LEGS?
WELL, IT MIGHT. YOU'D SAY YOU DON'T PAY FOR COLLEGE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO GET INTO COLLEGE AND THEN CAN'T AFFORD IT AND DON'T GO OR DROP OUT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND, THIS WOULD SAY INSTEAD OF PAYING UP FRONT, YOU PAY ABOUT 3% OF YOUR INCOME. IF YOU DO VERY WELL, DO YOU A WHOLE LOT. IF YOU DON'T DO THAT WELL, YOU DON'T PAY THAT MUCH. IT'S A VERY INTERESTING IDEA WE'RE EXPLORING. I THINK IT MAKES SOME SENSE.
ARE WE GOING BACKWARDS HERE? YOU KNOW, WHY HAS COLLEGE EDUCATION GONE UP SO MUCH COMPARED TO ALMOST ANY OTHER COMMODITY? IS IT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO REIGN IN THE COST OF COLLEGE? IT SEEMS INEXPLICABLE THAT IT'S BECOME SO EXPENSIVE?
IT DOES. WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE. MY FATHER WAS AN EXTERMINATOR. I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE FROM A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY. IF WE WERE... IF I WAS YOUNG TODAY, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. AND THE COST HAS GONE UP MUCH MORE THAN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. SO THERE'S SOME TALK OF SAYING THAT COLLEGES WON'T GET AID IF THEIR TUITION GOES UP HIGHER THAN THE RATE OF INFLATION.
Jon: IT'S GONE UP FAR BEYOND THE RATE OF INFLATION.
YEAH YEAH, SO WE WOULD IMPOSE THAT. NOW, YOU HAVE TO MAKE EXCEPTIONS. WHAT IF THEY HAD A BIG BUILDING PROGRAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE COST OF COLLEGE. IT'S BECOMING... COLLEGE ON THE ONE HAND IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF A NECESSITY AND IT'S BECOMING LESS AND LESS OF REALITY TO PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S SO DARN EXPENSIVE THAT EVEN PEOPLE WELL INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS CAN'T AFFORD IT. BUT FOR THE MOMENT, AT THE VERY LEAST TO SAY PEOPLE SHOULD PAY AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE, YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR HOME, YOU CAN REFINANCE YOUR CAR, BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO REFINANCE YOUR COLLEGE LOAN AND YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH? WHY SHOULDN'T WE DO THAT? I WOULD HOPE... WE'LL KEEP GOING AT IT. WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS BILL UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I HOPE PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING WILL E-MAIL THEIR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN AND SAY, FOR GOD SAKES, LET'S PASS THIS.
OK GIVE US, WHAT'S YOUR E-MAIL? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NEXT TIME YOU CAN COME AND JOIN US IN PERSON UNLESS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S PRESSING SENATE BUSINESS. I'M JUST KIDDING OF COURSE.
I'D LOVE TO BE WITH YOU IN PERSON.
THANKS VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
