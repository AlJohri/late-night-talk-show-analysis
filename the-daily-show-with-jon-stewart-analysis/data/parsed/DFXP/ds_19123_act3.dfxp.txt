[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE HOST OF HBO'S "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BILL MAHER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Jon: SIR, HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. I WAS HOPING YOU'D DO A LITTLE MORE CHENEY COUGHING FOR ME, THOUGH. I LOVE THAT IMPRESSION. YOU NAILED THAT, BY THE WAY.
Jon: HE HAS PHLEGM. NOBODY DOES CHENEY PHLEGM LIKE CHENEY.
DO A LITTLE MORE. [JON CLEARING HIS THROAT] I LOVE IT. I LOVE IT. OH, I TELL YOU.
Jon: HE'S TRYING TO GET THE INTELLIGENCE OUT OF...
THAT'S THE DEFINITIVE CHENEY PHLEGM. I MEAN, FRED TRAVALENA DOES A PRETTY GOOD ONE...
Jon: YEARS AGO. BUT, HE'S DOING AN IMPRESSION OF CHENEY COUGHING. I'M DOING CHENEY COUGHING.
YEAH, EXACTLY. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S SO TRUE.
Jon: CAN YOU, CAN YOU, DID YOU EVER IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD BE SITTING HERE, I DON'T KNOW, 11 YEARS AFTER INVADING IRAQ?
YOU WERE ABLE TO USE THE MESS 'O POTAMIA THING AGAIN.
Jon: MESS O'POTAMIA. I THOUGHT WE'D RETIRED THAT.
THAT REALLY AMORTIZED OVER TIME, DIDN'T IT? BECAUSE YOU GOT TO PUT IT UP AGAIN AND USE IT. VERY COST EFFECTIVE.
Jon: THE MONEY. AND WHEN WE RENDERED THAT GRAPHIC BACK THEN, YOU KNOW, WE HAD TO DO THE GRAPHICS BACK THEN BY HAND.
OH, OF COURSE.
Jon: THIS WAS YEARS AGO. WE WOULD DRAW EACH CELL. WE HAD SOME...
YOU SEND THEM OUT THE ITALY AND JAPAN.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WHAT WE WOULD DO IS AN ORIGAMI MOCK UP FIRST OF IT. AND THEN WE WOULD SEND IT OUT.
WHEN I STARTED IN TV WE USED PUPPETS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT? YOU WERE WITH SID AND MARTY CROFFT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO?
YES, YES, THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH.
Jon: YOU REMEMBER THOSE SHOWS. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.
I DO REMEMBER. VIVIDLY.
Jon: LIDSVILLE. BOY, TALK ABOUT LEGALIZING POT. [LAUGHTER]
I DO, QUITE OFTEN, AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. IT HAS WORKED. IS THAT, CAN YOU POINT TO THAT? ARE THERE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE ADVOCATED OVER THE YEARS THAT YOU FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT HAS HAD SOME EFFECT? WE HAVE HAD SOME ISSUE IN THE CONVERSATION?
ABSOLUTELY. PEOPLE USED TO ASK ME, YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU EVER RUN FOR OFFICE. THAT IS SUCH A SILLY QUESTION. I COULD NEVER. AND IF I DID, MY SLOGAN WOULD BE: 'DRUGS ARE GOOD AND RELIGION IS BAD.' [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO, YOU CAN'T PROBABLY RUN FOR OFFICE ON IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE NEEDLE HAS MOVED ON BOTH THOSE.
Jon: RIGHT.
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE COME OVER TO MY WAY OF THINKING. DRUGS ARE GOOD AND RELIGION IS BAD. I'M GOING TO STICK WITH WITH THAT.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE RELIGION THING. DO YOU THINK THIS COUNTRY HAS MOVED... I STILL FEEL LIKE THIS FOR A WESTERN COUNTRY IS PROBABLY THE MOST RELIGIOUS.
OH, BY FAR.
Jon: THE MOST GOD-FEARING.
OH, OF COURSE. I MEAN WE'RE, YES, WE'RE, AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SOCIAL ISSUES, A STEP BEHIND...
Jon: RIGHT.
OTHER COUNTRIES. AND CERTAINLY ABOUT THAT. I MEAN, HILLARY CLINTON JUST SAID HER FAVORITE BOOK WAS THE BIBLE.
Jon: WASN'T, THAT I THOUGHT WAS SO FUNNY...
YOU COULDN'T FIND SOMETHING MORE VIOLENT LIKE "GAME OF THRONES"? THAT'S SO A BEAT BEHIND. YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST CERTAINLY NOT WHERE THE MILLENNIALS ARE. RIGHT?
Jon: WHAT?
WHO ARE THE MILLENNIALS HERE? [APPLAUSE] THEY'RE NOT RELIGIOUS.
Jon: BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT, THAT WAS MERELY AN INDICATION THAT SHE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. THAT WAS NOT...
I KNOW.
Jon: I DON'T THINK IN ANY REALITY THAT IS HER FAVORITE BOOK.
OH, OF COURSE NOT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, NOW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. SHE MET... YOU KNOW WHO IS A LIAR ABOUT THIS IS OBAMA. OBAMA'S ALWAYS SPOUTING SPIRITUAL BULL [BLEEPED], AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT FOR A SECOND.
Jon: YOU DON'T THINK?
HE'S A DROP-DEAD ATHEIST, ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: NO. HE SPENT, HOW MANY YEARS DID HE SPEND IN REVEREND WRIGHT'S CHURCH. HE SPENT A LONG TIME IN THE CHICAGO...
HE NEVER WENT. HE JOINED BECAUSE IT WAS POLITICALLY NECESSARY.
Jon: OH IS THAT TRUE, HE DIDN'T GO SO MUCH?
ABSOLUTELY NO.
Jon: NOT TO THE PICNICS? NOT TO ANYTHING?
NO, NOTHING. HE JOINED BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MOVE AHEAD IN THAT POLITICAL WORLD, AND, OF COURSE, YOU HAD TO BE PART OF THE CHURCH.
Jon: BUT DON'T THEY SAY, THOUGH, THAT IN THIS COUNTRY, IF YOU WANT TO BE ELECTED, THE ONE THING YOU CAN'T BE, YOU CAN BE GAY, A WOMAN, YOU CAN BE JEWISH,
YOU CAN'T BE AN ATHEIST...
Jon: YOU CAN'T BE AN ATHEIST. I FIND THAT SO BIZARRE.
SO BIZARRE AND SO WRONG BECAUSE IT IS  THE  SINGLE BIGGEST MINORITY IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: ATHEISTS?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: RIGHT. NOW I HAVE TO ASK YOU, THOUGH, BECAUSE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. THIS IS BEYOND IRAQ, THIS IS BEYOND IMMIGRATION, THIS IS BEYOND GAY MARRIAGE, THIS IS BEYOND BE RELIGION.
OH MY GOD, I'M NERVOUS.
Jon: DON'T BE NERVOUS. YOU ARE PART OWNER OF THE NEW YORK METROPOLITANS. THAT IS, THEY ARE MY FAVORITE TEAM. I AM AS OLD AS THEY ARE. WHEN YOU GO TO THE MEETING...
MINORITY OWNER, YEAH.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT A MINORITY. DO THEY CONSIDER JEWS A MINORITY OVER THERE? YOU'RE NOT A MINORITY. SO WHEN YOU GO OVER THERE...
NEVER IN NEW YORK.
Jon: CAN I GIVE YOU... I HAVE A JAR OF TEARS THAT I HAVE, THAT I HAVE BEEN SAVING. [LAUGHTER]
COULD YOU MIX WITH IT DICK CHENEY'S PHLEGM?
Jon: YES! IT WILL BE DONE. HAVE YOU BEEN TO AN OWNERSHIP MEETING YET?
NO, I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A MEETING. I'VE BEEN TO THE STADIUM A FEW TIMES SINCE THAT HAPPENED, BUT THIS IS MY FIRST MEETING TOMORROW. THEY PLAYED AWESOME THIS WEEK. I ALWAYS BRING THEM LUCK WHEN I COME TO NEW YORK.
YEAH, NO. THEY BEAT THE MARLINS 3 OUT OF 4, SO THAT'S, YOU KNOW, 3 OUT OF 4.  [LAUGHTER]
BUT THEY'RE STARTING TO HIT. THEY'RE STARTING TO HIT. YOU KNOW, I'M TELLING YOU. WEIRDER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. REMEMBER THE '69 METS?
Jon: WELL, NO, THE '69 METS WERE GREAT, BUT IT'S '73. I REMEMBER IN '73 THEY WERE LIKE 14 GAMES BEHIND.
OH REALLY?
Jon: IT WAS AUGUST. AND THEN TUG MCGRAW, IF YOU REMEMBER, DID THE WHOLE, "YOU GOT TO BELIEVE," AND THEY CHARGED BACK.
THAT'S RIGHT. BUT, WEREN'T THEY WAY BACK IN '69, TOO?
I DON'T BELIEVE SO. I THINK IN '69, THEY WERE BEHIND THE CUBS, BUT I THINK THEY WON 100 GAMES THAT YEAR OR VERY CLOSE TO THAT. THEY WERE A VERY GOOD TEAM. IN '73 THEY WERE TERRIBLE, BUT THE REST OF THE DIVISION WAS TERRIBLE.
WELL, THEY'RE A COME-FROM-BEHIND TEAM. MAKE YOUR OWN GAY JOKE NOW.
Jon: WELL, I'M EXCITED FOR YOU. I ALWAYS GO TO THE LAST MET GAME OF THE YEAR.
COME WITH ME SOME TIME.
Jon: WELL, I LIKE TO GO TO THE LAST GAME, BECAUSE THEN ME AND MY SON HAVE THE RUN OF THE PLACE.
OH.  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US, LITERALLY. IF YOU EVER WANT GO TO A SHAKE SHACK WITH NO LINE, LAST GAME OF THE YEAR, CITI FIELD.
I DON'T, BUT THANK YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: "REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER" AIRS FRIDAY NIGHTS AT 10:00 ON HBO. BILL MAHER.
