Jon: I THINK PERHAPS TONIGHT I'LL HAVE SOME HOT POCKETS. WELCOME BACK. SO CONGRESS CANNOT SOLVE THE BORDER CRISIS. OR ANY OTHER PROBLEM. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHY ARE WE IN THIS MESS TO BEGIN WITH?
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED IN 2012 IT WOULD ALLOW SOME CHILDREN TO REMAIN IN THE U.S. WITHOUT FEAR OF DEPORTATION. THAT PROGRAM APPLIED ONLY TO CHILDREN WHO ARRIVED AT THE U.S. BEFORE 2007. BUT SMUGGLERS IN CENTRAL AMERICA ARE CONVINCING FAMILIES THE REPRIEVE STILL STANDS.
FAMILIES ARE BEING LIED TO AND MANIPULATED BY THE COYOTES.
Jon: COYOTES. WHAT IF WE JUST GET THEM TO LOOK DOWN. [GUNFIRE] [APPLAUSE] NO, HONESTLY, THAT WAS REALLY LONG WALK FOR A WYLE E. COYOTE JOKE. TOOK YOU ALL AROUND THE BLOCK AND WENT... SO, THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES CAUSING THIS PROBLEM -- ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO THEIR HOME CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES, TRAINING ASSISTANCE TO CENTRAL AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT, REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION COURTS TO PROCESS MINORS MORE EFFICIENTLY.
YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE AMBIGUITIES IN OUR LAW THAT ARE CREATING THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE ALLOWING THESE TRAFFICKING GROUPS TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO PAY THEM $8,000 OR $10,000 TO BRING THEM HERE.
Jon: OR YOU CAN MAKE SEMANTIC CHANGES. THAT'S THE OTHER WAY WE COULD GO, JUST CHANGE THE WORDING. SIX OH ONE. FOR MORE ON THE HOUSE BOARDER BILL, WE TURN TO SENIOR IMMIGRATION CORRESPONDENT JORDAN KLEPPER IN MEXICO. JORDAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [APPLAUSE] JORDAN, IF OBAMA'S ACTION GIVES COYOTES LEEWAY TO LIE, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT THE HOUSE BILL IS GOING TO STOP THEM? IT'S RIDICULOUS.
FIRST OF ALL, JON, DOWN HERE THE TERM COYOTE IS CONSIDERED OFFENSIVE. THEY PREFER PEDIATRIC IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT.
Jon: WHERE, WHERE ARE YOU, JORDAN?
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN CHIHUAHUA AND AUSTIN. I'M TRAVELING WITH THE CONSULTANTS AS THEY EMIGRATE SOME PEDIATRICS. AND THEY'RE WORRIED THAT IF THE AMBIGUITY IS TAKEN OUT OF THE LAW THIS COULD BE THEIR LAST RUN.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, OBAMA'S 2012 ORDER, WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY ENABLING THESE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS COYOTES TO LIE, IT CLEARLY APPLIED ONLY TO CHILDREN WHO ENTERED BEFORE 2007 AND WERE PRESENT PHYSICALLY STILL IN 2012. SO THERE IS NO AMBIGUITY. WHERE IS THE AMBIGUITY?
PRESENT PHYSICALLY 2012 OF WHAT, 2012 OF WHAT, JON? WHAT ARE THESE TERMS. THEY COULD BE ANYTHING.
HOW COULD IT, HOW COULD IT BE CLEARER, JORDAN?
OKAY, IT COULD BE CLEARER. YOU COULD BOLD IT, YOU COULD UNDERLINE IT, BIGGER FONT. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE BORDER CRISIS, THERE ARE TOOLS AVAILABLE. DO DIAGRAMS OF HOW TO FOLLOW THE LAW LIKE IKEA. YOU KNOW, CLARIFY IT. YOU NEED TO CLARIFY THE LAW AND THE COYOTES WILL FOLLOW IT.
Jon: WHY? WHY WOULD CHANGING THE LAW STOP THESE PEOPLE FROM LYING ABOUT THE LAW? THEY'RE ALREADY LYING ABOUT IT NOW.
WHOA! THAT'S A SERIOUS CHARGE. ALL RIGHT. BE CAREFUL. YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP WITH A SLANDER SUIT ON YOUR HANDS.
Jon: I SEEM, I SEEM TO HAVE ANGERED YOU.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: I'M SORRY.
THAT IS SERIOUS, JON. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET SUED.
Jon: THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU. TOO LATE. BUT THEY ARE, THEY ARE LYING.
YES, BUT WITH A SOFT LIE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
IS IT REALLY LYING WHEN YOU'RE LYING TO A CHILD OR A FAMILY THAT DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER?
Jon: YES. THAT IS STILL, THAT IS STILL LYING, EVEN WHEN YOU DO IT TO CHILDREN.
NO, NO, NO, PLEASE. EVERYONE LIES TO KIDS TO GIVE THEM HOPE. YOU KNOW, SANTA IS REAL. YOU CAN GROW UP TO BE PRESIDENT. MOMMY AND DADDY LOVE EACH OTHER. [LAUGHTER]. KIDS NEED HOPE AND COYOTES ARE HERE TO PROVIDE IT. FOR A NOMINAL FEE OF $8,000 $10,000.
Jon: SO THE COYOTES WILL FILL THE SPACE OF AMBIGUITY IN WITH LIES, EVEN IF NO AMBIGUITY EXISTS, BUT THE ONE LINE THEY WILL NOT CROSS IS THE ABJECT LINE.
NOW YOU ARE GETTING IT.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S A LITTLE THING CALLED THE COYOTE'S CODE. SURE. YOU KNOW, THEY'LL SEW CHILDREN INTO THE UPHOLSTERY OF CARS, TAKE DESPERATE FAMILIES' ENTIRE SAVINGS, KILL THEM OFF IF THEY DON'T PAY, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU WILL NOT GET SOMEONE WHOSE PROFESSIONAL NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH AN AMORAL SCAVAGING BEAST TO LIE ABOUT THE REPEAL OF AN EXECUTIVE ACTION. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE NOT HYENAS.
Jon: THANK YOU, JORDAN. GOOD LUCK ON THE TRAIN. JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I DIDN'T REALIZE.
