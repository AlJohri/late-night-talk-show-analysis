FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME! TO THE "DAILY SHOW."  HOW ARE YOU? MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU  TONIGHT THAT I THINK YOU'RE  GOING TO FIND TOP NOTCH. OUR GUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT  CHRISTINE AMANPOUR. OH, CNN CORRESPONDENT. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THEY  RUIN HER. ( LAUGHTER )  SHE'S VERY GOOD. IT WON'T BE EASY. BUT THEY'LL TRY. I HOPE YOU GUYS HAD A GOOD  WEEKEND. I HAD A VERY NICE WEEKEND. I SPENT A GOOD TWO MINUTE OF IT  WATCHING THE KENTUCKY DERBY. ( LAUGHTER )  THE REST OF IT I SPENT WATCHING  THE 142nd ANNUAL CONVENTION  OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION HELD THIS YEAR IN  PARK SLOPE BROOK-- OH, NO, I  MEAN-- I'M SORRY, HOUSTON,  TEXAS. WHERE HIGH-VELOCITY PROJECTILE  LOVERS OF ONE STRIPE CAME  TOGETHER TO RAISE THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR! NOT TO PARTY LIKE THEY JUST  DON'T CARE ABOUT HIGH-5 EACH  OTHER WITH THEIR NON-GUN-HOLDING  HANDS. ( LAUGHTER )  IT WAS TO CELEBRATE THE SINGLE  ISSUE-- THE MEMBERS OF THE  NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION.
THE OBAMA LIBERALS WANT TO  DISREGARD THE 10th AMENDMENT  AND TRYING TO IMPLEMENT OBAMACARE AND TAKE AWAY OUR  LIBERTY.
Jon:  I'M SORRY, GENERAL  PATTON. I--  ( LAUGHTER )  ANYWAY, OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE  REFORM IS DESIGNED TO TAKE YOUR  LIBERTIES. FOCUSOK GUN AND RIFLE-RELATED  ISSUES SO--
WHEREY ARE THEY GOING AFTER  CHAPLAINS IN THE MILITARY SAYING  THEY CAN'T EVANGELIZE AND  PROSELYTIZE? ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  MY GUESS IS THAT  WORD DOES NOT MEAN WHAT IENING  IT MIGHT MINE. AGAIN, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. THE WAR ON CHRISTIANS THERE. BUT GETTING BACK TO GUNS.
WE'RE CREATING JOBS, DAY IN  AND DAY OUT IN THIS STATE.
IN BENGHAZI, ON SEPTEMBER THE  11th OF LAST YEAR.
THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK NOW  WANTS TO BAN PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF  LEGAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS. ( LAUGHTER )  GLI KNOW HOW UPSET YOU GET,  SARAH PALIN, WHEN YOU'RE IN NEW  YORK AND-- ( LAUGHTER )  WALK INTO A BODAIGA AND CAN'T  FIND YOUR PHILLY BLUNTS. LOOK. YOU'VE BEEN HERE TWICE, TWICE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND ONCE BECAUSE McCAIN MADE  YOU SO N. NEY. WAIT A MINUTE, ALL THESE  PEOPLE-- THIS IS THE SAME LINEUP  WITH THE SAME LAUNDRY LIST OF CONSERVATIVE GRIEVANCES THAT WE  SAW AT CPAC A MONTH AND A HALF  ANOTHER JUST WITH BETTER  INTRODUCTIONS.
♪ ♪ ♪
YEAH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME TO TEXAS, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN.
Jon:  WOW. IF THAT DUDE DOESN'T HAVE A  C.M.T. SHOW BY TOMORROW, LOCK,  STOCK AND-- UM, UM--
LET'S SEE. I THE THIRD ONE I CAN'T. SORRY. OOPS.
Jon:  YEAH, OOPS. THAT'S WHAT IT IS, LOCK, STOCK,  AND UM, UM, I FORGOT THE THIRD  ONE, OOPS. I SWEAR THESE CONSERVATIVE GUYS  ARE LIKE CARNEYS UPON THE  SAUSAGE AND PEPPER TRUCKS AT STREET FAIRS. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO TO GE AND  THERE'S THE SAUSAGE AND SANDWICH  GUY, AND THEN GUTO THE UPPER BROADWAY FESTIVAL AND IT'S THE  SAME SAUSAGE GUY. AND YOU GO TO THE PUERTO RICO  DAY'S PARADE, AND ST. 58'S, AND  ANY CULTURAL EVENT GUTO YOU WILL SEE THE SAME SAUSAGE TRUCK. EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE. THAT'S A DIFFERENT PARADE. THAT'S DIFFERENT.
I BELIEVE YOU CAN GET PEP  WERS THAT AS WELL. ( LAUGHTER )  LOOK, EVENTUALLY THE SPEAKSERS  DID GET TO GUNS AND HOW UPSET  THEY ARE AT THE WAY THAT THEIR OPPONENTS ARE FIGHTING.
THE PRESIDENT IS FOND OF  USING EMOTION AND,  UNFORTUNATELY, DISREGARDING THE  FACTS.
WE HAVE LEADERS WHO PRACTICE  THE POLITICS OF EMOTION.
WE WILL FIGHT THEIR TACTICS  OF FEAR. WE WILL FIGHT THEIR TACTICS OF  DARKNESS!
Jon:  YES! YES! YES! FIGHT THEIR DARKNESS, YOU WILL! ( LAUGHTER )  YES! FEAR LEADS TO ANGER. ANGER LEADS TO HATE. HATE, HATE LEADS TO HATE  ( BLEEP ). ( LAUGHTER )  I DON'T-- HOW THIS QUOTE ENDS, I  DO NOT KNOW. ALL RIGHT, LUKE SKIED WALKER,  GLENN BECK, FEAR MONTHERING IS  WRONG. YOU'RE WRITE RITE. PLEASE MAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT  GUNS IN A RATIONAL AND CALM WAY.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  YOUR MOM AND SISTER GETTING  RAPED AND THEN WALKING HOME UNMOLESTED IS A GUN.
Jon:  YOU-- YOU ARE AWARE  THAT FEAR IS AN EMOTION, RIGHT? I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THE BIG  ONES, ALONG WITH-- THERE'S THREE  OF THEM, I THINK-- GUILT, AND FEAR AND UM, UM-- I FORGOT THE  THIRD. ( LAUGHTER )  OOPS. ( APPLAUSE )  CONTINUE, N.R.A. CONVENTION,  REASON.
WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA WHERE A DEAD  TERRORIST BOMB FRER CHECHNYA HAS MORE RIGHTS THAN AN AMERICAN  CITIZEN.
THIS IS A FIGHT FOR THE  FUTURE OF FREEDOM!
LYING IN WAIT RIGHT NOW IS A  TERRORIST, A DERANGED SCHOOL  SHOOTER, A KIDNAPPER, A RAPIST, A�i MURDERER, WAITING AND PLANNING  AND PLOTTING. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )    ( CHEERS )
Jon:  YES, HE'S TALKIN'  ABOUT YOU PEOPLE! YUP, THERE'S A TERRORIST AND  CRIMINALS WAITING AND PLOTTING,  AND BECAUSE OF THIS GUY THIEK GET A GUN ON THE SPIRNT WITH NO  BACKGROUND CHECKS. YOU'RE WELCOME, EVERYBODY! BUT, OF COURSE, THESE TYPES OF  CONTRADICTIONS, THEY USE FEAR,  WE USE FEAR. ARE NOT AN ANOMALY. NOT A BUG IN THE N.R.A. SYSTEM  BUT A FEATURE. AT THE HEART OF THE N.R.A.'S  MESSAGE IS DON'T LET LIBERALS  SAY IT'S A DANGEROUS WORLD AND SCARE YOU INTO GUN CONTROL. LET US SAY IT'S A DANGEROUS  WORLD AND SCARE YOU INTO  GUN-A-PALOH, ZZA. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THEIR MESSAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE.
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD  GUY WITH A GUN IS A GOOD GUY  WITH A GUN. GLI DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ONLY  WAY. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT EVEN IF THAT'S RIGHT, THIS  IS A QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU  DETERMINE THE BAD GUY AND THE GOOD GUY?�r  THE GOOD GUY MIGHT TURN INTO A  BAD GUY AND THEN HE HAS A GUN  AND THE BAD GUY TURNS INTO A GOOD GUY. WHO ARE THE BAD GUYS.
THE FOUNDERS ALSO WARNED  ABOUT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT  WOULD TAKE THE�i GUNS.
THIEW KNEW THAT HAPPENS TO  GOVERNMENTS, AND GOVERNMENTS  TURN AGAINST THEIR PEOPLE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP.�i  TYRANNY THEN WOULD GO  UNDEFEATED.
Jon:  BY THE�� WAY,  MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE, WORST  MONOPOLY GAME YET. SO WE GOT IT-- GOVERNMENT'S THE  BAD GUY. GOTTA HAVE GUNS AS A BULLED WAR,  AGAINST TYRANNY.
BOSTON PROVES IT. WHEN BRAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT  OFFICERS DID THEIR JOBS IN THAT  CITY SO COURAGEOUSLY, GOOD GUYS WITH GUNS STOPPED TERRORISTS  WITH GUNS.
Jon:  GOT IT. GOVERNMENT'S THE GOOD GUY--  WAIT. ( LAUGHTER )  SO THE POLICE ARE THE GOOD GUYS,  AND WHO THEY WORK FOR? THE GOVERNMENT. SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE GOOD  GUYS ARE AND THE BAD GUYS ARE. IN FACT, THESE GUYS AREN'T TOO  SURE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TYRANNY,  EITHER.
I'LL TELL YOU, I WAS PROUD TO  JOIN WITH MY FRIENDS SENATOR  RAND PAUL AND SENATOR MIKE LEIGH IS WRITING A SHORT AND SIMPLE  LETTER TO HARRY REID THAT SAID  WE WILL FILIBUSTER ANY LEGISLATION THAT UNDERMINES THE  SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO KEEP  AND BEAR ARMS.
Jon:  OOH! THEY DID IT. AND THEIR FILIBUSTER WAS ABLE TO  DEFEAT THE GUN CONTROL BILL  INCLUDING THE MARCHION-TOOMEY AMENDMENT, SUPPORTED BY 90% OF  MERICANS AND 55 OUT OF 100A  SENATORS. HERE IS TYRANNY EARLIER, CREWS  CRUZ TALKING ABOUT A GUN RIGHTS  BILL HE THWARTED.
THAT BILL GOT 52 VOTES IN THE  U.S. SENATE, INCLUDING NINE  DEMOCRATS. WHAT HAPPENED? HARRY REID AND THE REST OF THE  DEMOCRATS FILIBUSTERED THE BILL  AND KILLED IT, DEMANDING 60 VOTES.�r
Jon:  YOU KNOW IT'S THE  SAME ( BLEEP ) THING, RIGHT? LOOK, SHEERS WHAT'S CRAZY. WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. BAD GUYS NOT TO HAVE GUNS. SOME PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF,  BELIEVE A GOOD WAY TO DO, THAT  AT LEAST TO START, IS TOO CHECK WHO'S BUYING THEM, OR MAKE THE  GUNS SOMEWHAT TRACEABLE SO WHEN  THE BAD GUYS GET THEM WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW. NOT WAIT FOR A BAD GUY TO DRAW  AND THEN DRAW FASTER. WHICH, BY THE WAY, IF THAT'S  WHAT YOU WANT, OKAY. WE'LL HAVE THAT DEBATE, BUT STOP  PREPPING THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS  ARE THE LAST BARRIER STANDING BETWEEN A FREE AMERICA AND  OBAMA-SPONSORED GOVERNMENT MOM  RAPE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
