FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST, BRIAN JAY JONES. >>HE'S THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BIOGRAPHY ON JIM HENSON. VERY EXCITED TO TALK TO HIM. EARLIER THIS WEEK WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF OBAMACARE WAS MARRED BY WEB GLITCHES AND LONG DELAYS. BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER MAJOR OBSTACLE TO OBAMACARE'S IMPLEMENTATION. TOTAL DICKISHNESS. YOU SEE, OBAMACARE FOR ALL ITS WELL-DOCUMENTED ISSUES AND PROBLEMS IS STILL A WELL-INTENTIONED ATTEMPT TO GET PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD HEALTH INSURANCE IN THIS COUNTRY HEALTH INSURANCE. MEDICAID HAS TRADITIONALLY COVERED PEOPLE UP TO THIS INCOME LEVEL. OBAMACARE WAS GOING TO COVER THEM OSTENSIBLY DOWN TO THIS INCOME LEVEL. SO IT WAS GOING TO BE THE GAP THERE, ABOUT THE SIZE OF AN iPAD EXCEPT INSTEAD OF AN iPAD IT IS ABOUT 8 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING JUST ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE SO TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THIS NATION'S, YOU KNOW, CREAMY CENTER, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO GIVE THE STATE GOVERNMENTS MONEY TO EXPAND THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAM. FOR THREE YEARS THE STATES WOULD PAY FOR THIS PROGRAM, I THINK THE NUMBER WAS ABOUT 0. AND THEN AFTER THAT, THEY WOULD PAY UP TO 10%, I THINK, BY THE TIME IT WAS 2020. SO WHAT A GREAT DEAL. BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT.
26 STATES DECLINED TO GO TO THAT EXPENSE.
26 STATES. HOLY-- THAT'S LIKE A THIRD OF--  (LAUGHTER) A LITTLE MORE-- 26 STATES! IT MUST BE A PRETTY ECLECTIC GROUP WITH MANY DIFFERENT REASONS TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY WOULD TURN DOWN FEDERAL MONEY TO BRING HEALTH CARE TO THEIR WORKING POOR OR MAY BE IT WAS JUST ONE REASON.
ALL OF THOSE STATES HAVE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS OR LEGISLATURES THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS.
OH. WHICH MAKES IT REALLY HARD NOT TO SEE THIS IS JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THAT HIT GAME SHOW SWEEPING PART OF THE NATION, WHAT DO YOU HATE MORE, POVERTY OR OBAMA? BROUGHT TO YOU BY SPITE. SPITE, THE EMOTION THAT MAKES YOU TURN DOWN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS HEALTH CARE FOR THE WORKING POOR BECAUSE YOU HATE THE PRESIDENT. AND ARBY'S. ARBY'S. (LAUGHTER) TECHNICALLY IT'S FOOD. NOW OF COURSE-- OF COURSE I IMAGINE THAT THE STATES WHEN ASKED WHY THEY DIDN'T ACCEPT THE MEDICAID EXPANSION DON'T PROBABLY LIST SPITE AS THE ANSWER. SO LET'S SEE WHAT THEIR REASON IS. YOU THERE, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE IN THIS NATION THAT HAS THE MOST UNINSURED CHILDREN OUT OF ANY OTHER STATE.
MEDICAID EXPANSION IS SIMPLY PUT A MISGUIDED AND ULTIMATELY DOOMED ATTEMPT TO MASK THE SHORTCOMINGS OF OBAMACARE.
TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IS NOT UNLIKE ADDING A THOUSAND PEOPLE TO THE TITANIC.
Jon: TRUE, THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S REALLY TRUE. IF THE TITANIC HAD CRASHED INTO A HOSPITAL. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW WHAT, EVERYTHING'S BIGGER IN TEXAS, ESPECIALLY TUMORS. WHAT ABOUT YOU, MISSISSIPPI. YOU, MISSISSIPPI, OR AS YOU ARE ALSO KNOWN, THE 49th HEALTHIEST STATE IN THE UNION-ISSIPPI.
OF ALL THE STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT SHOULD BE EMBRACING SOME OF THE CHANGES COMING FROM OBAMACARE, YOUR CRITICS WOULD SAY MISSISSIPPI SHOULD BE AT THE FRONT OF THE LIST.
PETER, THE PROBLEM IS, IT IS THE WORST SYSTEM OF DELIVERING HEALTH CARE KNOWN TO MAN.
Jon: NO, IT'S NOT. LISTEN, IT'S NOT PERFECT. A LOT OF THINGS WE'D LIKE TO CHANGE BUT IT IS NOT THE WORST SYSTEM OF DELIVERING HEALTH CARE KNOWN TO MAN. AS ANYBODY KNOWS WHO HAS BEEN A PATIENT AT ENEMA HUT. (LAUGHTER) ENEMA HUT, BECAUSE THERE AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU THAT CAN'T BE CURED BY SOME RECTAL IRRIGATION. NOW YOU ARE PROBABLY THINKING, JON, THIS IS SO ABSTRACT WITH THESE NUMBERS. CAN YOU SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? MAYBE WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM THE SHOW ME STATE, MISSOURI.
45-YEAR-OLD BERTHA McINTYRE NEEDS DAILY MEDICATION. SHE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID IN MISSOURI BECAUSE HER FAMILY INCOME IS TOO HIGH, ABOUT $1200 A MONTH.
WELL AIN'T SHE FANCY! WHAT, WITH HER CLOTHES AND SHELTER. SEE THAT WOMAN IS CONSIDERED TOO RICH FOR MEDICAID, BUT TOO POOR FOR THE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES TO HAVE AN EFFECT. YES, THAT'S HOW MUCH SENSE THIS ALL MAKES. SO WHY NOT EXPAND MEDICAID, MISSOURI.
REPUBLICAN STATE SENATOR JOHN LAMPING ARGUES MISSOURI FACES TOUGH CHOICES.
THE ENTIRE COST OF MEDICAID IN MISSOURI IS ONE-THIRD OF MISSOURI'S BUDGET. WE CAN BARELY AFFORD TO BE IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS TODAY.
Jon: BOY, THIS IS A TOUGH CHOICE. SHOULD WE AS A STATE ACCEPT 100% OF THIS PROGRAM'S EXPANSION COSTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OR I DON'T KNOW-- [BLEEP] IT? BUT IT IS A TOUGH CHOICE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOUGH CHOICES YOUR CITIZENS ARE MAKING?
AM I GOING TO TAKE FOOD OUT OF A CHILD'S STOMACH OR AM I GOING DO WITHOUT GOING TO THE DOCTOR, WHICH WOULD YOU CHOOSE?
HERE'S THE BEST PART. THESE GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT FEDERAL DOLLARS TO EXPAND MEDICAID FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT NICE LADY, ALL BUT THREE OF THOSE 26 STATES THEY REPRESENT ALREADY TAKE MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAN THEY CONTRIBUTE IN TAX DOLLARS. THEY ARE ALREADY BURDENS ON THE SYSTEM. I BELIEVE THEY'RE REFERRED TO BY THOSE REPUBLICANS AS MOOCHERS. MOOCHER STATES. AND IF STATEHOOD WAS HEALTH CARE, MISSISSIPPI AND MISSOURI WOULD BE REJECTED AS HAVING THAT AS A PREEXISTING CONDITION. SO YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF, SO WHAT DO THESE UNINSURED PEOPLE DO FOR HEALTH CARE. WELL, REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY HAD THAT COVERED IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKED OUT.
WELL, WE DO PROVIDE CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. PEOPLE, IF SOMEONE HAS A HEART ATTACK, THEY DON'T SIT IN THEIR APARTMENT AND DIE. WE PICK THEM UP IN A AMBULANCE AND TAKE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL AND GIVE THEM CARE.
Jon: HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE IS RIGHT. YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. YOU CAN ALWAYS GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK AND APPARENTLY THEY THINK THAT'S THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE OPTION RATHER THAN EXPANDSING MEDICAID, BECAUSE UNLIKE OBAMACARE, WE ALL KNOW ER VISITS ARE FREE! JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.
WHEN THE UNINSURED END UP HERE IN THE ER, THEIR COSTS ARE PASSED ON TO PAYING CUSTOMERS. THAT MEANS INSURANCE COMPANIES END UP PAYING MORE SO THEY RAISE RATES. AND FEWER PEOPLE CAN AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE.
THE IMPACT TO OUR HOSPITAL DISTRICT IS $52 MILLION A YEAR. HAD WE EXPANDED MEDICAID, WE WOULD HAVE GOT THAT 52 MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INSTEAD WE'RE GETTING FROM LOCAL TAXPAYERS.
Jon: GOT IT? MEDICAL CARE FOR THE UNINSURED HAS ALREADY BALLOONED THE COST OF THE SYSTEM. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THOSE COSTS. SO IF YOU HAVE A BETTER ANSWER, REPUBLICANS, LET'S [BLEEP] HEAR IT! BUT DON'T MAKE YOUR PLAN, WHAT DO WE NEED FOOD STAMPS FOR WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE DINE AND DASH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
