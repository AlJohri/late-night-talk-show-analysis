Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THE FOUNDER AND OWNER OF THE VILLALOBOS RESCUE CENTER FOR PIT BULLS IN NEW ORLEANS, SHE AND THE CENTER ARE THE SUBJECT OF ANIMAL PLANET'S "PIT BULLS & PAROLEES."
THEY DON'T GOT NO PUPPIES. THEY TOSS YOU AWAY AFTER YOU HAVE THEM.
IT TOLD ME THAT THERE IS PROBABLY NO PUPPIES OUT THERE.
ALL SHE WANTED WAS TO GET OUT AND GET IN HERE. AND WHAT IS REALLY PROBABLY THE SADDEST THING IS HUMANS DID THIS TO HER. AND HERE SHE'S ASKING A HUMAN AGAIN FOR HELP. AND THAT'S FORGIVENESS.
I PROMISE, WE WON'T LEAVE YOU. WE WON'T LEAVE YOU.
Jon: IT'S A REALLY GOOD SHOW. PLEASE WELCOME TIA TORRES. HELLO! (APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: COME AND SIT! HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
GOOD, NO, IT'S GREAT.
Jon: I LOVE THIS SHOW.
THANK YOU.
Jon: WHAT YOU DO TO REHABILITATE THE IMAGE OF THE PIT BULL AND ALSO PAROLEES, IT'S THESE TWO GROUPS. SOMEWHAT DISCOUNTED BY SOCIETY. AND YOU SEE THEM COME TOGETHER IN COMMON CAUSE. AND IT'S REALLY QUITE BEAUTIFUL.
WELL YOU KNOW, THE GUYS ACTUALLY TELL US, THE PAROLLEES ACTUALLY THEY SAY THAT THEY CAN RELATE TO THESE DOGS BECAUSE THEY FEEL VERY MUCH IN TOUCH WITH THEM AS FAR AS THE IMAGE THAT IS PORTRAYED BY BOTH GROUPS. THE DIFFERENCE BEING, AND THIS IS BY THEIR OWN WORDS, IS THAT THE PIT BULLS HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG TO END UP IN, YOU KNOW, DOGGIE JAIL...
Jon: RIGHT.
UNLIKE THE GUYS WHO MAKE MISTAKES AND END UP IN PRISON. THEY SAID, SO ESPECIALLY THE DOG DOES NOT DESERVE THE TREATMENT THAT THEY GET.
Jon: IT'S AMAZING. AND THE ONLY THING I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF BECAUSE REALITY TELEVISION, YOU JUST NEVER KNOW. THIS IS REAL, RIGHT? THIS IS ISN'T LIKE PEOPLE DRESSED UP AS DOGS AND LIKE OTHER GUYS...
NOPE.
Jon: THIS IS A REAL SHOW.
YES.
Jon: YOU REALLY DO THIS GOOD THING. BECAUSE IT'S A REMARKABLE AND AS I WATCH THE SHOW, INCREDIBLY TAXING. YOU KNOW, YOU DO IT WITH YOUR WHOLE FAMILY. THE TWO DAUGHTERS, TWO SONS, THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS, THIS WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND IT'S RELENTLESS.
YES.
Jon: AND IT NEVER SEEMS TO STOP.
IT'S 200% REAL.
Jon: YEAH.
200% REAL. YEAH.
Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF REAL.
YEAH, WE ARE THE REAL. YEAH, WE ARE THE REAL.
Jon: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE STORIES THAT GIVE YOU THE HEART TO KEEP CONTINUING AS THESE DOGS JUST KEEP COMING IN. WERE THERE ANY IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU THOUGHT, BOY THAT'S A STORY THAT GIVES ME THE STRENGTH TO KEEP DOING THIS.
YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE GREEN ROOM WITH SOME OF YOUR PEOPLE. SINCE MOVING TO LOUISIANA, AND THE SOUTH IN GENERAL, THE WAY--
Jon: YOU CAME FROM CALIFORNIA.
WE CAME FROM CALIFORNIA ORIGINALLY, YEAH, THREE YEARS AGO.
Jon: YEAH.
AND THE WAY THAT DOGS ARE DISCARDED OR TREATED IN THE SOUTH IS DIFFERENT.
Jon: REALLY?
IT'S JUST A CULTURAL DIFFERENCE. A LOT OF DOGS ARE JUST CHAINED UP IN THE BACKYARD, THEY'RE LEFT TO JUST KIND OF FEND FOR THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW, RUNNING AROUND YOUR PROPERTY, ON THE STREETS. SO NOT EVERYBODY, BUT IT IS PRETTY COMMON.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND THE SAD PART IS THE SOUTH, ESPECIALLY IN THE LOUISIANA WHERE WE ARE AT, THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT WE DID IN CALIFORNIA OR LIKE HERE IN NEW YORK, WITH ANIMAL SHELTERS, THE HUMANE SOCIETIES. SO YOU KIND OF FEEL LIKE YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN GROUND ZERO WHEN ARE YOU OUT THERE.
Jon: WHERE DO YOU GET RESOURCES THEN, IS THAT JUST, DOES THE SHOW HELP WITH THAT? CAN THEY, YOU KNOW, FREE YOU GUYS TO DO THAT? WILL THEY THROW YOU A COUPLE DOGGY BEDS?
IT'S YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOOD AND BAD THAT COMES WITH HAVING A SHOW. YES, WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NOTICE US NOW AND SAY WELL, I WANT TO ADOPT A DOG...
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT WE ALSO GET, YOU KNOW, QUADRUPLE THE AMOUNT OF DOGS COMING IN, AND PEOPLE NEEDING THE HELP. SO IT SOMEWHAT HAS BACKFIRED A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF DOGS. WE ARE UP TO A LITTLE OVER 400 DOGS RIGHT NOW.
Jon: YOU HAVE 400 DOGS. AND THAT IS ALL IN ONE STUDIO APARTMENT. THAT IS AMAZING. (LAUGHTER)
YES.
Jon: JUST STACKED UP.
YES, YES.
Jon: IS THE FACILITY YOURS? ALSO PROBABLY DON'T HAVE THE LAND THAT YOU HAD.
NO, AND IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD A BIG RANCH.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO NOW WE'RE LIVING IN A MORE URBAN TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT SO WE HAVE LIKE A BIG WAREHOUSE BUILDING, LIKE AN ANIMAL SHELTER. WE HAVE THREE OF THEM NOW.
Jon: WHAT IS IT THAT IT TAKES TO REHABILITATE A DOG AND THEN CONVINCE PEOPLE AND MAKE THAT MATCH? BECAUSE THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE SHOW IS PEOPLE WILL COME IN AND EXPRESS INTEREST. BUT YOU ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO MAKE A MATCH WITH A DOG UNLESS IT'S RIGHT. THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN--  CERTAIN DOGS NEED A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT. AND YOU ARE VERY STRICT ABOUT THAT.
I WILL TELL YOU WHY. BESIDES THE OBVIOUS, WHICH IS WE WANT THE DOGS TO HAVE THE BEST HOMES BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY CAME FROM, WE'RE DEALING WITH A BREED THAT, YOU KNOW, SOCIETY HAS WAITED FOR IT TO DO SOMETHING WRONG SO THEY CAN JUST THROW US ALL UNDER THE BUS. AND THE THING IS, YOU KNOW, I KNEW WHO JON STEWART WAS BEFORE I KNEW WHO THE DAILY SHOW WAS BECAUSE YOU ARE SUCH A PIT BULL ADVOCATE.
I ENJOY THEM.
AND SO, I KNEW WHO YOU WERE JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR LOVE FOR THE BREED YEARS AGO.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WE ARE ALWAYS OUT THERE HAVING TO WATCH OUT FOR OUR DOGS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ADOPTING THEM OUT, YOU KNOW, WE ONLY WANT THE BEST OF THE BEST OUT THERE TO REPRESENT OUR BREED.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND MUCH OF THE TIME IT'S THE OWNERS ARE MAKING THESE STUPID MISTAKES WITH THESE DOGS AND IT BACKFIRES ON ALL OF US.
Jon: I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DOG THAT IS -- THE THINGS THAT MAKE THAT DOG SUCH A SPECIAL DOG, ITS LOYALTY, ITS PLAYFULNESS, ITS STRENGTH.
RIGHT.
Jon: CAN BE TURNED AGAINST IT.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND USED IN A MANNER THAT IS MORE OF A THREAT.
IT IS ALSO A BREED THAT IS SO WILLING TO PLEASE ITS OWNER THEY ALMOST BECOME THEIR OWN WORST ENEMY.
Jon: RIGHT.
I KIND OF MAKE A SIDE JOKE, LIKE I SAY, GERMAN SHEPHERD, BORDER COLIES ARE VERY SMART DOGS, THEY ARE SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHEN A HUMAN IS MISTREATING THEM. OUR DOGS ARE JUST LIKE THESE BIG DUMB DOPEY DOGS THAT GO...
Jon: RIGHT.
OKAY, BEAT ME SOME MORE, I STILL LOVE YOU THOUGH.
Jon: RIGHT, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY AFFECTIONATE DOGS.
AND VERY FORGIVING. VERY FORGIVING.
Jon: AND YOU DON'T GET THE SENSE, BECAUSE I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOOK AT CATS SOMETIMES AND I LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OTHER DOGS AND THINK, IF I DIE, THIS GUY IS EATING ME. MAYBE WITHIN LIKE FOUR OR FIVE HOURS. LIKE, THIS IS, I FEEL LIKE WITH THE PIT BULL, THEY WOULD ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO TRY AND GET HELP.
YES.
Jon: AS OPPOSED TO JUST PUTTING ON A BIB AND GOING ALL RIGHT, LET'S EAT.
YEAH. THEY'RE JUST THAT WAY, YOU KNOW. THEY'RE JUST THAT WAY.
Jon: SUPERSWEET.
THEY ARE.
AND THAT BLOCK HEAD. YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT BLOCK HEAD.
YEAH. YES. YES.
Jon: YOU KNOW, AND IT'S FUNNY, YOU REMEMBER LITTLE RASCALS...
RIGHT.
Jon: PETIE WAS A PIT BULL.
RIGHT.
Jon: HE WAS THE NANNY, THEY WERE THE NANNY DOGS.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
Jon: THEY TOOK CARE OF PEOPLE WHO HAD MISTREATED THEM.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: WELL, I LOVE THE SHOW. WHEN DOES THE NEW SEASON START?
OCTOBER 4th WHICH IS I GUESS COMING UP ON A SATURDAY.
Jon: BUT EVERYTHING WORKED OUT GOOD RIGHT? YOU ALL JUST SAVE THE DOGS AND NOTHING, AM I GOING TO CRY? IS THIS GOING TO BE A SEASON WHERE I CRY A LITTLE BIT?
YEAH, A LOT, KIND OF, YEAH.
Jon: HOW BAD -- LIKE A PUDDLE, LIKE I'M A PUDDLE OR --
YOU'RE A PUDDLE.
Jon: NOT EVEN A MINOR LEAGUE.
NO, YOU'RE A PUDDLE.
Jon: LIKE OH, I MIGHT HAVE THE SNIFFLES, LIKE SERIOUSLY I'M OUT.
SERIOUS PUDDLE.
Jon: I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ACTUALLY. THE NEW SEASON OF "PIT BULLS & PAROLEES," IT PREMIERS ON ANIMAL PLANET OCTOBER 4th. 10 P.M. TIA TORRES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
