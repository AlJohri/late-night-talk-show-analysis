MAY 30, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WALL STREET WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT, DAN RATHER, THE LEGENDARY NEWSMAN DAN RATHER IS HERE. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE BIG NEWS IN POLITICS.
THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. GOVERNOR ROMNEY WINNING THE TEXAS PRIMARY AND SECURING ENOUGH DELEGATES TO BECOME THE  G.O.P. NOMINEE.
Jon:  IT IS OFFICIAL AFTER 28 YEARS, $2 TRILLION, AND THREE UNSOLVED MURDERS LATER, WILBEERDINK CUMMERBUND ROMNEY WILL BE THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL MOM NETWORK OR ROM-IN-EY. YOU WANT TO USE THAT? YOU WANT TO USE ROM-IN-EY? LAWYER UP. YOU WANT TO USE, THAT LAWYER UP. MY LAWYER FROM THE FIRM ( BLEEP ) YOU AND PAY ME. I GUESS THAT'S IT. THE CONEY ISLAND MERMAID'S PARADE THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IS DONE. WE'RE LEFT WITH FIVE MONTHS OF OBAMA V. ROMNEY. YUP. ( LAUGHTER ) FIVE MONTHS OF JOHNNY PREGNANT PAUSE...
FOR YEARS WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THE PIGGEST PROBLEM ON THE BENCH  WAS JUDICIAL ACTIVISM OR A LACK OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT. THAT, UH, UNELECTED... GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD SOMEHOW OVERTURN-- UH, UH, A DUAL CONSTITUTED AND  PASSED-- UH... ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WHAT IS GOING ON IN-- I FEEL LIKE IN THE LONG PAUSE HE'S GIVING A SPEECH TO A  DIFFERENT COUNTRY THAT HE LIKES BETTER THAN US. ANYWAY, IT'S JOHNNY PREGNANT PAUSE VERSUS CAPTAIN CHUCK-O-BUNS.
SO WHEN YOU RAISE THE INDIVIDUAL TAX RATES-- I'M LOSING SOUND HERE AREN'T? I'M TELLING YOU, THESE BATTERS WERE MADE BY WASHINGTON, D.C. BUREAUCRATS, I CAN TELL.
HA... HA... IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE. BATTERS ARE MADE BY PRIVATE COMPANIES.  THAT GUY KILLS ME. SERIOUSLY, I HOPE HE ( BLEEP ) KILLS ME NOW. THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO SUCK. IT'S A GOOD THING I GET TWO WEEKS OFF EVERY OTHER WEEK. ( LAUGHTER ) I MIGHT AS WELL RESIGN MYSELF TO THE LONG SLOG TO NOVEMBER WITH  NO RAY OF LIGHT O'ER HOPE.
OOOOOH!  ♪ ♪ ♪
Jon:  WHAT-- COMEDY GODS? IS THAT YOU? DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT APPEARS TO BE SOME SORT OF WELL-TIMED GAG GIFT. ( LAUGHTER ) SUPPORTED BY 60-POUND TEST WIRE. COULD IT BE? NO! IN MY DESPAIR OVER NOT HAVING GOOD ELECTION MATERIAL, HAVE THE COMEDY GODS DELIVERED UNTO ME A TRUMP-O-GRAM. ( APPLAUSE ) LET'S SEE WHOSE INSIDE. HOLD ON. LET'S SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.
DONALD TRUMP DOUBLING DOWN TODAY ON HIS BIRTHY CLAIMS ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
OH! THANK YOU GILDA RADNER, GORGE CARL AND I KNOW RICHARD PRYOR, YES, THE COMEDY GODS DELIVER. HE HOLDS A FUND RAISE WER REALITY SHOW HOST AND ANTIQUE DOLL HAIR THIEF DONALD TRUMP, GIVING TRUMP AN EXCUSE TO DO PHONE INTERVIEWS ON NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT THREE SEPARATE CABLE  NEWS NETWORKS.
I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF BIRTHER OR NOT BIRTHER. BUT THERE'S A MAJOR QUESTION HERE, AND THE PRESS DOESN'T WANT TO COVER IT. THE PRESS JUST REFUSES TO COVER IT.
Jon:  THAT IS A SHOT OF PURE IMPORTED RARE, SINGLE MALT BLACK TAR TRUMP RESIN. NOT BECAUSE TRUMP'S COMPLAINING THAT THE PRESS REFUSES TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS LONG-DEAD  BIRTHER ISSUE BUT BECAUSE OF HOW TRUMP RESPONDS LATER THAT SAME DAY TO THE PROCESS' QUESTIONS  ABOUT THIS LONG-DEAD BIRTHER ISSUE.
Reporter: TELL US WHAT YOUR PEOPLE WHO WERE INVESTIGATING IN HAWAII WHAT, THEY FOUND?
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO OLD NEWS. NOW, IT'S APPROPRIATE, I THINK, THAT WE GET TO THE SUBJECT OF HAND WHICH IS JOBS, WHICH IS THE ECONOMY, WHICH IS HOW OUR  COUNTRY IS NOT DOING WELL AT ALL UNDER THIS LEADERSHIP, WHICH IS REALLY THE THINGS I WANTED TO  TALK TO YOU ABOUT, BUT YOU LIKE TO KEEP GOING BACK TO THE PLACE OF BIRTH.
Jon:  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER ) NOBODY'S MAN ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT THE BIRTHER ISSUE. ( BLEEP ) YOU FOR BRINGING IT UP. WATCH THIS LITTLE BIT OF BITTERER TRUMP.
THE STATE OF HAWAII SAYS IT IS OFFICIAL, HE WAS BORN IN HAWAII OTHIS DATE, HERE IT IS, WHY DO YOU DENY THAT?
A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT THINK IT WAS AN AUTHENTIC CERTIFICATE.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU SAY "MANY PEOPLE." --
MANY PEOPLE.
LIKE WHO, GIVE ME THE NAMEAVE PERSON IN AUTHORITY THAT-- GIVE ME A NAME.
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE-- I DON'T GIVE NAMES. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS AUTHENTIC.
Jon:  LISTEN, I DON'T GIVE NAMES. I CAN'T. YOU LOOK AT MY POSSESSIONS. THE ONLY NAME I KNOW IS TRUMP. I USE IT LIKE THE SMURFS USE SMURFS, SO DON'T TRUMP ME BLITZER, OR I'LL TRUMPY SO HARD  UP YOUR TRUMP YOUR HEAD OF TRUMP. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WHOLE BIRTHY TRUMP, TRUMP STILL HAS TIME TO SELL, BABY, SELL.
YOU'RE NOT ON A MATTRESS ON TOP OF TRUMP, ARE YOU.
IT'S SITTING ON A TRUMP MATTRESS BY CERTA. IT'S A GREAT MATTRESS. YOU SHOULD BUY ONE.
A TRUMP MATTRESS.
BY CERTA.
Jon:  JUST BECAUSE YEAR SLEEPING ON IT DOESN'T MAKE IT A TRUMP MATTRESS. I DON'T SLEEP IN STEWART SHEETS. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD FOR BREAKFAST? TRUMP MUFFINS BY THOMASES? I LIKE HOW THE BUTTER GOES INTO THE NOOKS AND TRUMPS." ( LAUGHTER )  AND WE HAVE TO COVER ROMNEY AND OBAMA KNOWING THIS BEAUTIFUL MAN IS OUT THERE? ( LAUGHTER ) THIS RARE BIRD THAT ORANGE BIZARRELY TUFTED FLAPPING AROUND IN THE FOREST? WE HAVE TO COVER THESE TWO NUMB NUTS? IT'S LIKE YOU'RE AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL AND THE POO FIGHTERRERS  ARE ON THE STAGE BUT YOU CAN'T GO BECAUSE YOU PROMISED YOUR FRIEND YOU'D GO TO A COUNTRY BAND. I'M NOT INSULTING HIPSTERS. OBVIOUSLY, THEY DON'T WATCH. ( LAUGHTER ) SERIOUSLY, A BAND SHOULDN'T HAVE SOMEONE ON THE... THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES. WE NEED A MAN WITH UNERRING CONFIDENCE. AND NO ONE IS MORE CONFIDENT THAT A GUY WHOSE EVERY TELEVISION EPISODE ENDS WITH HIM  HAVING HIS ASS KISSED IN STEREO.
I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
I AGREE.
CATHERINE?
YES, SIR, I AGREE 100%.
I AGREE.
ABSOLUTELY.
I AGREE 100%.
THAT WAS A VERY TOUGH DECISION.
IT REALLY WAS.
I DO NOT ENVY YOU.
I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.
I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION, IN THIS CASE I DON'T THINK YOU HAD A CHOICE.
IT WAS THE RIGHT CALL.
DO YOU FEEL OKAY. NA?
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU WERE RIGHT ON ABOUT THE FIRE.
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT DID YOU THINK?
AFTER THAT COMMENT, I THINK YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION.
Jon:ONALD TRUMP'S EGO IS LIKE A GOOSE LIVER THAT'S BEEN  FORCE FED PRAISETHROUGH ITS EAR TUBES SO THAT WHEN YOU CONSUME IT YOU DON'T TASTE ATSOUANT OF  SELF-DOUBT, AND THAT IS WHY I MUST DO THIS. DONALD, YOU HAVE TO GET BACK INTO THE RACE FOR PRESIDENT. I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP ME. OH, MY GOD. ( LAUGHTER ) COME OVER. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT. WE'LL HAVE DINNER. YOU BRING A PITA, AND IN A GESTURE OF ECSTASY GOOD WILL, I'LL BRING TWO
