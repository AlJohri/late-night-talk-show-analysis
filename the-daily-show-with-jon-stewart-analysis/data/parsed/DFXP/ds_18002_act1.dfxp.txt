Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, LIAM NEESON,  THE STAR OF "TAKEN, 2: THE  TOOKNING."  (LAUGHTER)  CONTINUING WITH OUR LINEUP OF GUESTS THAT ARE THREE TIMES THE  SIZE OF ME. (LAUGHTER)  WHO DID WE HAVE ON LAST NIGHT? WHO WAS ON THE SHOW LAST NIGHT? SCHWARZENEGGER! I DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW SO --  (LAUGHTER). SCHWARZENEGGER. WE HAD -- AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE,  LIAM NISSAN, OE KWRAOEULLY. THERE'S NOT ONE GUEST THIS PASS  MONTH WHOSE ASS I CAN KICK. (LAUGHTER)  DOES DR. RUTH STILL DO SHOWS? (LAUGHTER)  LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE  URGENT ISSUE OF IN-PERSON VOTER  FRAUD WHICH, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, IS NONEXISTENT BUT NEVERTHELESS --  (LAUGHTER). A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ALL  AMERICANS. PARTICULARLY IN SWING STATES  CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICAN  LEGISLATURES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA'S  VOTER I.D. LAW. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THAT LAW  AGAIN PENNSYLVANIA'S REPUBLICAN  HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER?
VOTER I.D. WHICH IS GOING TO  ALLOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO WIN THE  STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. DONE.
Jon: BUT HEY --  (LAUGHTER). -- THIS IS JUST BETWEEN US  CHICKENS, RIGHT? HUH? I MEAN, WHEN THE MICS AND THE  CAMERAS GO ON PICK A LOCK, YOU  KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? PICK A LOCK. WHAT'S THAT RED -- OKAY, SO IT'S  ON. AS IT TURNS OUT, THE VOTER I.D. LAWS OSTENSIBLY SET UP TO STOP  NONEXISTENT INN-PERSON VOTER  FRAUD HAVE THE RESIDUAL EFFECT  OF DISENFRANCHISING AND SUPPRESSING ACTUAL ELIGIBLE  VOTERS. DISPROPORTIONATELY OF THE  MINORITY, POOR, AND ELDERLY  VARIETY OR, AS THEY ARE  SOMETIMES KNOWN, DEMOCRATS. (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, THAT LAW HAS BEEN  CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS AND WE  ARE EXPECTING A RULING --  (LAUGHTER). ALL RIGHT, JUST ROLL THE RULING.
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS RIGHT  NOW. A JUDGE HAS ISSUED A DECISION IN  PENNSYLVANIA'S CONTROVERSIAL  VOTER I.D. LAW.
Jon: ALL THOSE WITHOUT  VOTER I.D. MUST GAY MARRY WHILST  ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA DURING THE  FIRST TRIMESTER! THERE, I (BLEEP)ING SETTLED  EVERYTHING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S ALL DONE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID THE ACTUAL JUDGE RULE?
THE JUDGE TODAY PUT A HOLD ON  THAT NEW VOTER I.D. STATE LAW.
WHAT THE JUDGE SAYS HERE IS  I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED IN MY  PREDICTIVE JUDGMENT THAT THERE  WON'T BE ANY VOTER DISENFRANCHISEMENT ARISING OUT  OF THIS NEW LAW.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL,  DISENFRANCHISEMENT. (LAUGHTER)  SECOND OF ALL, TYPICAL LIBERAL  JUDGE! STRIKING DOWN A PERFECTLY  HYPOTHETICAL SOLUTION FOR FEAR  OF THE REAL HARM THAT IT DOES. (LAUGHTER)  SHOW ME ONE PERSON WHO THIS LAW  WOULD DISENFRANCHISE.
BILL INTERNICOLA, A  91-YEAR-OLD ARMY VETERAN OF  WORLD WAR II WHO EARNED THE  BRONZE STAR AND LEGION OF HONOR FOR HIS SERVICE IS ONE OF THE  VOTERS TARGETED BY THE STATE AS  A POTENTIAL NONCITIZEN.
Jon: PUH! BRONZE STAR! OH, WHAT DID HE COME IN THIRD IN  THE WAR? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  DID HE -- DIDN'T EVEN WIN A  SILVER OR GOLD IN THE WAR. ALL RIGHT, FINE. THAT VERY SWEET COURAGEOUS  ELDERLY MAN. SHOW ME TWO PEOPLE!
68-YEAR-OLD DORIS CLARK WAS  TURNED DOWN THREE TIMES APPLYING  FOR HER PENNSYLVANIA VOTER I.D. CARD AND EVERY TIME, SHE SAYS,  THE STATE WANTED ANOTHER  DOCUMENT.
YOU FEEL LIKE WHY AM I GOING  THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS? I'M NOT BIN LADEN'S WIFE. YOU KNOW? (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHO SAID ANYTHING  ABOUT BIN LADEN? (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, WITH THAT COMMENT,  YOU WOULD BE BIN LADEN'S WIDOW. (LAUGHTER)  SORRY, I'M NOT GOING TO REALLY  BELIEVE THESE LAWS PERSECUTE  ANYBODY UNTIL IT AFFECTS  SOMEBODY FROM TELEVISION. I.E., A REAL AMERICAN.
YESTERDAY JIM CRAMER, CNBC'S  POPULAR HOST, TOLD HIS HALF  MILLION TWITTER FOLLOWERS HIS  ELDERLY FATHER "WON'T BE ALLOWED TO VOTE BECAUSE HE DOES NOT  DRIVE. HE IS ELDERLY AND CAN'T PROVE  HIS CITIZENSHIP."
Jon: I HATE KNOWING JIM  CRAMER HAS A FATHER! (LAUGHTER)  WELL, I HOPE HE AND HIS FATHER  ARE BOTH SITTING DOWN BECAUSE  JIM CRAMER ALSO HAS A LONG-LOST  BROTHER! YES! LOUIS C.K.! YOU ARE JIM CRAMER'S LONG-LOST  BROTHER! (APPLAUSE)  LOUIS C.K . THE "C.K." STANDS  FOR "CRAMER KIN."  (LAUGHTER)  FOR MORE ON THIS ISSUE WE'RE  JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LARRY, THESE -- THESE VOTER I.D. LAWS AS WE SEE COULD POTENTIALLY  DISENFRANCHISE THOUSANDS OF  VOTERS. YOUR REACTION?
YEAH, JON, ON BEHALF OF BLACK  PEOPLE I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO  AMERICA. OBVIOUSLY THESE LAWS WERE MEANT  TO SUPPRESS THE BLACK VOTE,  WHICH HAS GONE 95% FOR OBAMA BUT  IT WOUND UP HURTING INNOCENTS LIKE JIM CRAMER'S DAD. (LAUGHTER)  SO SORRY, OLD PEOPLE. THAT (BLEEP) WAS MEANT FOR US,  NOT FOR YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT  YOUR FAULT. IT'S -- OKAY, SO I SHOULDN'T  HAVE -- SORRY.
LOOK, JON, IN THE WORLD OF  VOTER SUPPRESSION BLACK FOLKS  ARE THE DELICIOUS TUNA. (LAUGHTER)  IRRESISTIBLE. WORLD WAR II VETERANS AND  GRANDMAS ARE JUST THE INNOCENT  DOLPHINS WHO GET PULLED UP IN  THE NET. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: UM -- IN YOUR MIND  WHERE DID THESE LAWS GO WRONG?
RIGHT, WELL, LOOK. THEY'RE TOO INDIRECT. YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE A LAW AND  HOPE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY  AFFECTS BLACK PEOPLE! (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT  DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT AS  BLACK PEOPLE! AND NOT JUST ON PAPER. RACISM WORKS BEST IN PERSON. DISTRUST BUT VERIFY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: LIKE A COP PULLING YOU  OVER FOR, LIKE, A D.W. B. (LAUGHTER)
SORRY, WHAT'S THAT, JON?
Jon: A D.W.B., YOU KNOW,  LIKE A -- DRIVING WHILE BLACK. (LAUGHTER)
DID YOU JUST LEARN THAT  PHRASE, STKPWHRO *PB.
Jon: NO! NO! YEAH. UM -- CAT WILLIAMS SPECIAL.
YEAH. D.W. B. WHAT ARE YOU DOWN WITH  THE BROTHERS NOW, STKPWHRO *PB.
WHAT? WHAT? IS DOWN GOOD?
JUST DROP THE SLANG AND STEP  AWAY, JON.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. WHEN A COP DOES A D.W.B. --  (LAUGHTER). -- HE CAN SEE YOU'RE BLACK. BUT WHEN YOU PURGE ELVIRA  WASHINGTON FROM THE VOTER RULES,  THAT SOUNDS BLACK BUT YOU DON'T  KNOW. IT'S LIKE BEING PULLED OVER BY A  BLIND COP. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW? HE HEARS YOUR HIP-HOP MUSIC,  HOW'S HE SUPPOSE TO KNOW YOU'RE  A JEWISH KID FROM OBERLIN? (APPLAUSE)
Jon: BUT, LOOK, THE WHOLE  THING -- HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO  KNOW. THE WHOLE THING IS A FARCE. IN-PERSON VOTER FRAUD DOESN'T  EXIST. IT'S LIKE OUTLAWING NEW YORK MET  WORLD SERIES CELEBRATIONS. IT DOESN'T --  (LAUGHTER).
THERE YOU GO, JON.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
ACTUALLY, VOTER FRAUD LAWS  HAVE GIVEN ME A GREAT IDEA.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
VOTER FRAUD. (LAUGHTER)  I URGE BLACK PEOPLE TO VOTE  EARLY AND OFTEN. (LAUGHTER)  AND THEN LATE, OKAY? NOW, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A  CONCERTED GET OUT THE FRAUD  EFFORT.
Jon: ARE YOU SURE, LARRY,  YOU WANT TO COME IN ON NATIONAL  TELEVISION AND ADVOCATE BREAKING THE LAW?
IT'S BASIC CABLE, IT'S NOT  NATIONAL TELEVISION. BESIDES, YOU CALL IT BREAKING  THE LAW. I CALL IT MAKING UP FOR LOST  TIME. ALL THOSE YEARS WE COUNTED AS  THREE-FIFTHS OF A PERSON WHILE  WE WERE DOING TEN-FIFTHS OF THE  WORK? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND  FRACTIONS. (LAUGHTER)
HOW OLD IS THIS COUNTRY,  STKPWHRO *PB.
Jon: ABOUT 240?
HOW LONG HAVE BLACK PEOPLE  BEEN ALLOWED TO VOTE?
Jon: ABOUT 150.
IN ALABAMA?
ABOUT 48.
Jon: EXACTLY. NOW WE'VE GOT TO KEEP EXTRA  VOTING UNTIL WE CATCH UP. HERE'S TIPS TO HELP BLACK PEOPLE  EXTRA VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME. OKAY? FIRST, CONFIDENCE. NOW, REMEMBER, THESE POLLING  STATIONS ARE STAFFED BY SWEET  OLD WHITE LADIES. USE THAT (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER)  OH, YEAH, YEAH, JUST WALK IN  TALL, YEAH, THAT'S ME RIGHT  THERE, MILDRED HIGGINS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: RIGHT, YEAH, YOU'RE  MILDRED HIGGINS, SURE, YEAH,  RIGHT.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
Jon: NO, GO AHEAD, YOU CAN  GO RIGHT THERE. THAT'S FINE.
WHICH BRINGS US TO TIP TWO: TWO:  INTIMIDATION.
Jon: OH, THAT'S NICE, I GET  THAT.
SEE HOW I DID THAT? I NEED TO VOTE? WHERE'S MY BALLOT?
Jon: WOW, YOU'RE RIGHT,  THAT IS INTIMIDATING.
COME ON, JON, YOU'RE SUCH A  SWEET OLD WHITE LADY, JON.
Jon: THANK YOU, LARRY. ON THE OFF CHANCE YELLING  DOESN'T WORK.
AGAIN, WE'RE DEALING WITH THE  ELDERLY. THEY DON'T SEE SO WELL SO YOU  CAN ALWAYS USE THE ART OF  DISGUISE.
Jon: OH, YEAH, RIGHT, THE  ART OF DISGUISE IS GOING TO MAKE  SURE THAT PEOPLE -- HEY, WHERE'D LARRY GO. I WAS JUST TALKING TO LARRY  ABOUT VOTER FRAUD.
WHAT LARRY? I'M LUIGI, I WANT MY BALLOT AND  SOME DINNER!
Jon: ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY,  I'LL TRY TO FIND A BALLOT FOR  YOU -- OH, GEEZ! LARRY! GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, I WAS  JUST TALKING WITH AN ASIAN  GENTLEMAN. (LAUGHTER)
WAS MY ACCENT THAT BAD?
Jon: IT WAS TERRIBLE. I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD STICK  WITH INTIMIDATION.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. GET ME ANOTHER BALLOT, I  (BLEEP)ED THIS ONE UP! (LAUGHTER)  LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
