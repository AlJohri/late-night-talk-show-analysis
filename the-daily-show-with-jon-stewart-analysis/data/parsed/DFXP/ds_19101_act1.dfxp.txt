FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST FROM THE NEW MOVIE "NEIGHBORS" SETH ROGEN IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ONCE AGAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST -- BUT FIRST 2014 MID TERM ELECTIONS ARE BUT SIX MONTHS AWAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
WHO WILL RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016?
WHO WILL RUN IN 2016.
HOW DO YOU WIN 2016?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 2016?
Jon: WHY SPECULATE ABOUT THE NEAR FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN SPECULATE ABOUT THE FAR FUTURE. [LAUGHTER] COMING UP YOUR TEN-DAY FORECAST FOR NEXT FEBRUARY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014. THE 2016 FOREPLAY EDITION. NOW OBVIOUSLY, FOR ALL WE KNOW JOE WILL BE THE PRESIDENT. WE DON'T KNOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JUST A FELLA WE MET. BUT OBVIOUSLY, FOR ALL WE KNOW NOW THE 2016 ELECTION COULD COME DOWN TO ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT STREP VERSUS THE PETRIFIED EXOSKELETON OF DONALD TRUMP'S HAIR HELMET. [LAUGHTER] BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT DREAM MATCHUP CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE HINT OF WHO YOU HAVE AS THE FAVORITES TO THE RUNUP TO THE PRE-SPECULATION HYPOTHETICALS?
THE PRESIDENT REALLY SEEMED TO PUT HIS FINGER ON THE SCALE IN FAVOR OF HILLARY CLINTON.
JEB BUSH GETTING A BIG BOOST AMID GROWING SPECULATION ABOUT HIS POSSIBLE PLANS FOR 2016.
Jon: YES! CLINTON V BUSH. THANK GOD WE FOUGHT A BLOODY WAR AGAINST ENGLAND SO THAT POLITICAL POWER WOULD NO LONGER BE CONSOLIDATED IN BUT ONE FAMILY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BECAUSE TO MY MIND, TWO JUST MAKES SENSE. I MEAN, CONSOLIDATED IN THREE FAMILIES THAT'S TOO MUCH. THEN YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A WHOLE GAME OF THRONES THING GOING ON. YOU HAVE THE KILLINGS, YOU'VE GOT THE SEX. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT TO TWO FAMILIES. IT FEELS RIGHT. WHAT DOES BUSH 43 THINK OF BUSH 45 MAYBE JOINING 41? HIKE?
UH YOU KNOW, I HAVE REALLY HAVE NOT TALKED TO JEB ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY. IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. I COULD SEE YOU FORGETTING YOU WERE THE PRESIDENT. I COULD SEE THAT. [LAUGHTER] I WAS -- YOU WERE THE PRESIDENT. NAH, I'M PRETTY SURE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PAINTER. PRETTY SURE, PRETTY SURE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PAINTER OF CATS AND FEET. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, GIVE US A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO THIS MAN JEB WHO WE'VE BEEN REPEATEDLY TOLD IS YOUR BROTHER. WHAT MIGHT BE ON HIS MIND?
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IS ON HIS MIND. AND, WE'LL TALK WHEN HE IS READY. I NOTICE HE IS MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY QUITE A BIT.
Jon: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU DON'T TALK TO YOUR BROTHER BUT YOU ARE TRACKING HIS MOVEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DID YOU TAG JEB'S EAR TO TRACK HIS MIGRATORY PATTERNS. OLD JEB IS HEADING SOUTH. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OR IF IT'S MATING SEASON. BOYS CHECK THE NEST. [LAUGHTER] MY BUSH IMPRESSION IS COMPLETELY GONE. SO, I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN LOCK JEB BUSH IN BASED ON THE VAGUE RAMBLINGS OF CHAUNCEY GARDNER HERE. BUT, MAYBE THE TEA LEAVES ARE A LITTLE CLEARER WHEN IT COMES TO THE RIVAL DYNASTY.
WHAT DOES HILLARY'S INFAMOUS TESTIMONY, ALONG WITH THIS NEW EVIDENCE MEAN FOR HER 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RUN?
COULD THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE HURT HER CHANCES IN 2016?
WHAT CHELSEA'S MATERNITY COULD MEAN FOR 2016.
WHY DID VANITY FAIR JUST GIVE HUGE PLAY TO A NEW FEATURE ON MONICA LEWINSKY AND HOW DOES THIS EFFECT A HILLARY RUN?
THE REVELATIONS FROM HER BEST FRIEND'S DIARY AND WHAT THEY COULD MEAN FOR 2016.
Jon: HILLARY CLINTON MOVING FOOD THROUGH HER ESOPHAGUS USING THE PROCESS OF PERISTALSIS. DOES THIS MEAN SHE'S HUNGRY FOR 2016? AND COULD HER EXCLUSION FROM THE CAST PHOTO OF THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE HURT HER CHANCES FOR A PRESIDENTIAL RUN? WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE CAN'T KNOW BUT STILL, WHAT? NOT ONLY DOES EVERY EVENT IN THE UNIVERSE EXERT POSSIBLE INFLUENCE ON A HILLARY RUN BUT A POSSIBLE HILLARY RUN EXERTS INFLUENCE ON EVERY EVENT IN UNIVERSE.
WOULD VANITY FAIR PUBLISH ANYTHING ABOUT MONICA LEWINSKY THAT HILLARY CLINTON DIDN'T WANT IN VANITY FAIR? I REALLY WONDER IF THIS ISN'T AN EFFORT ON THE CLINTON'S PART.
GETTING IT OUT OF THE WAY SO WE CAN SAY ONE MORE TIME IT'S OLD NEWS SEEMS LIKE A STRATEGY OR A TACTIC PERHAPS.
Jon: OH WOW. IS IT JUST ME, OR DID IT JUST GET CRAZY IN HERE? DID IT? YEAH HEY VANITY FAIR, IT'S HILLARY. YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED ABOUT RECENTLY? ONE OF MOST PAINFUL AND HUMILIATING EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE. SO, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD PUBLICLY REHASH IT FOR ME, AS A PART OF AN IMPLAUSIBLY CONVOLUTED PLAN TO GIVE ME A BOOST I DO NEED TO DEFEAT JOE BIDE ANYWAY. AND IS IT -- DID YOU JUST SEE THAT FLY? OR IS THAT A DRONE? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? HILLARY? [LAUGHTER] AND AS IF TO FAN THE FLAMES OF SPECULATION, CLINTON MADE AN APPEARANCE AT A CLASSIC FIRST STOP FOR ANY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CONFERENCE.
WHAT IS YOUR GUILTY PLEASURE? [LAUGHTER]
LET'S SEE. UM -- [LAUGHTER]
ARE THERE THAT MANY?
I'M TRYING TO THINK OF, YOU KNOW, THE G-RATED ONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: MISS CLINTON IF YOU'RE NASTY. ALTHOUGH, I HAVE TO SAY YOU COULD PROBABLY GO AT LEAST PG-13 WITH THIS CROWD. YOU ARE AT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CONFERENCE. MY GUESS IS THEIR EARS ARE NOT QUITE AS DELICATE AS YOU MIGHT THINK UNLESS YOUR GUILTY PLEASURE IS FREE BASING CRACK COCAINE WHILST ASTRIDE THE FRESHLY KILLED CARCUS OF AN ENDANGERED AFRICAN RHINO.
LOOK, CHOCOLATE. I MEAN, I HATE TO BE SO PREDICTABLE.  IT'S LIKE GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN. IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEART. I NEVER CAN STOP WITH JUST ONE SQUARE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT GIRL. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE ARE TOTALLY CONNECTING TO ME AS A VOTER AND A WOMAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT IS NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE? BAKING CHOCOLATE. [ LAUGHTER ] COME ON. THERE'S GOT TO BE OTHER NAMES OUT THERE. WHAT ABOUT TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY. REMEMBER HIM? HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND COULDN'T REMEMBER ALL THREE OF THE DEPARTMENTS HE WANTED TO ABOLISH IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
OOPS.
Jon: YEAH. I WONDER IF OLD WYATT OOPS IS GOING TO GET BACK IN THE SADDLE.
YOU RAN IN 2012. A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A BOTCHED EFFORT ON YOUR PART. HOW DO YOU GET A SECOND LOOK NOW?
I THINK AMERICA IS A PLACE THAT BELIEVES IN SECOND CHANCES. I THINK THAT WE SEE MORE CHARACTER OUT OF AN INDIVIDUAL BY HOW DO YOU PERFORM AFTER YOU FAIL AND YOU GO FORWARD?
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT IS CRAZY, I ACTUALLY, I BELIEVE HIM. I DO WANT TO GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE. I FEEL LIKE HE IS SMARTER NOW SOMEHOW. I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. WHAT IS DIFFERENT? JUST PUT UP THE TWO PICTURES. OH MY GOD. I KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING. HE'S DOING THE REVERSE SHE'S ALL THAT. HE'S GOING FROM THE HANDSOME BIMBO TO THE BOOKWORM. WELL, RICK PERRY  MAY LOSE FREDDY PRINZE, JR., BUT HE MIGHT WIN THE PRESIDENCY. I'M WILLING TO GRANT GOVERNOR PERRY THAT SECOND CHANCE. SHOW US YOUR NEW AND IMPROVED GRASP OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES.
I THINK AMERICANS ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THOSE 90 MILLION PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OF WORK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID YOU JUST SAY 90 MILLION? HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. OOPS. YOU ARE SO CLOSE. YOU ARE ONLY -- [LAUGHTER] -- OFF BY AROUND 80 MILLION. UNLESS, UNLESS OF COURSE YOU ARE INCLUDING CHILDREN,  STUDENTS AND OLD PEOPLE PAST THE AGE OF 65 AS PART OF YOUR OUT OF WORK FORCE BUT THAT WOULD BE FAR TOO STUPID FOR A MAN WITH GLASSES OF ENSMARTENMENT. IT'S ONLY 2014 AND 2016 IS ALREADY SHAPING UP TO BE A LAME REMIX. IS THERE ANYTHING OUT THERE FOR US TO LOOK FORWARD TO?
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE 2018 MID TERMS.
JULIAN CASTRO THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR OF SAN ANTONIO. DOES HE END UP RUNNING FOR HIGHER OFFICE IN 2018, 2020, 2022?
IF THEY DON'T IMPROVE THEIR STANDING WITH LATINO VOTERS THEY CAN FORGET ABOUT ELECTIONS IN 2020, 2024.
2052 BY MY MATH WILL BE THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN WHICH THE CLINTON MEZVINSKY BABY IS ELIGIBLE.
Jon: WELL, AND THE CLINTON MEZVINSKY BABY WILL BE SQUARING OFF IN 2052 AGAINST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, OH FOR GOD SAKES, MITT ROMNEY LET IT GO. ♪ LET IT GO. LET IT GO ♪ WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
