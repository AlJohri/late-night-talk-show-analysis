Jon: WELCOME BACK. OVER THE YEARS, ITALY HAS HAD  ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS. CENTURIES OF OCCUPATION BY  FOREIGN POWERS, A VARIETY OF  FAILED GOVERNMENTS SPANNING FROM MERELY CORRUPT TO FASCIST AND  WORST OF ALL ACTORS WHO DON'T  KNOW HOW FLOORS WORK. NO, THAT'S WHAT THE SPACES ARE  FOR. NOW ITALY IS FACED WITH THE  SPICIEST PROBLEM.
THE COUNTRY IN POLITICAL  CHAOS AFTER AN ELECTION WITHOUT  A CLEAR WINNER.
IT'S AT RISK OF BECOMING  UNGOVERNABLE.
PROBABLY A BIG AS MESS AS I  COULD BE.
Jon: WHO HOLD AN ELECTION  AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHO THE  WINNER IS? THAT WOULD BE US S 13 YEARS AGO  BUT IN TODAY'S MODERN WORLD WITH  THE iPHONE 4. WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY WON BY THE SLIM MAJORITY  BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SEATS  IN THE ITALIAN SENATE TO FORM A  GOVERNMENT.
WHAT THREW A WRENCH INTO ALL  OF THIS WAS A BIG VOTE FOR A  PROTEST PARTY LED BY A ITALIAN  COMEDIAN. TO MAKE THINGS COMPLICATED  FORMER PRIME MINISTER BERLUSCONI  IS NOT OUT OF PICTURE.
BERLUSCONI GOT 29%.
Jon: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I GET THE VOTING FOR THE CENTER  LEFT. I EVEN GET THE COMEDY PROTEST. HOW THE (bleep) IS BERYL BERLUSCONI,  CHAIRMAN BUNGA BUNGA, HOW IS HE  NOT DISQUALIFIED FROM THIS ENTIRE THING? HIS CORRUPTION CONVICTION? HE CALLED THE SITTING PRIME  MINISTER OF GERMANY AN  UN(bleep) LARD ASS. YEAH THAT'S WHAT THIS  UN(bleep) LARD ASS ACTUALLY  SAID. LUCKILY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LUCKILY NO MATTER HOW MESSY  ITALY'S POLITICS GET ITALIANS  FIND STABILITY IN THEIR FAITH.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE  FAITHFUL FILLING ST. PETER'S  SQUARE TO HEAR THE POPE WHO LEAVES OFFICE TOMORROW. THERE'S A PERIOD WHERE THERE'S  NO POPE AND THAT STARTS  PRECISELY AT 8:01 TOMORROW  NIGHT.
Jon: IT'S CHAOS! (bleep) CAP WITH CONDOMS. IT BRINGS US TO OUR  REOCCURRING -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR RECOVERING SEGMENT WE MAY  HAVE TROUBLE SEPARATING CHURCH  AND STATE BUT AT LEAST WE STILL HAVE BOTH. POPE BENEDICT MADE HIS LAST  APPEARANCE THIS MORNING. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR  HIM? CAN'T SET HIM UP AS AN EXPOPE  AND WAL-MART GREETER. THAT'S NOT GOING TO -- IN NOMINE  PATRIS ET FILI, GATORADE AT  AISLE 8. [ LAUGHTER ] DOES THE GO TO THE ITALIAN VAT  RAN RETIREMENT HOME.
AT THE END OF MONTH HE HAS TO  MANY OF OUT OF APOSTOLIC PALACE. TODAY THE VATICAN REVEALED HIS  RETIREMENT HOME IS JUST BEHIND  ST. PETER'S.
Jon: THAT'S COMFORTABLE. YOU KNOW HE'S UNEXPECTEDLY  STOPPING BY CHECKING ON THE NEW  POPE. OH, REALLY IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE  HOLDING COMMUNION NOW SNL I USED  DO IT OVER THERE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTED. BUT ALL RIGHT. IT'S OVER THERE. ANY OTHER PERKS THAT THE POPE  MIGHT BE LOSING?
THE RED PRADA SHOES THAT HE  IS SO VERY FOND OF, WELL, THEY  GO.
Jon: THAT HAS TO HURT. NO GREATER INSULT TO A MAN IN  ITALY THAN TAKE AWAY HIS  DESIGNER SHOES. BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM  BECAUSE HE COULD MAKE HIMSELF  POPE AGAIN BY CLICKING HIS HEELS TOGETHER THREE TIMES AND  REPEATING "THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE  ROME."  WAIT FOR IT. NOW THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS HAS  TO ELECT A NEW POPE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY  CONSIDER?
VOTING CARDINALS ARE KNOWN TO  HAVE COVERED UP FOR PEDOPHILE  PRIESTS.
Jon: OKAY. THAT'S AN ISSUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THEN THERE'S THE ITALIAN  PAPERS FULL OF REPORTS OF A  DOSSIER PREPARED FOR THE POPE'S EYES ONLY SPROAZEDLY --  SUPPOSEDLY DETAILING A SEX AND  BLACKMAIL SCANDAL INSIDE THE  VATICAN.
Jon: I WAS THINKING OF THEE  LOGICAL ISSUES. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHO  PREPARES THAT DOSSIER FOR THE  POPE.
HE MET PRIVATELY WITH THE  ELDERLY ITALIAN INVESTIGATORS. THE ITALIAN PRESS CALLEDS THEM  THE 007 CARDINALS.
Jon: AH, THE RARE PAPAL  DESIGNATION 807 CARDINAL. MAYBE ITALY DOESN'T HAVE A POPE  OR PRIME MINISTER NOW BUT IT  DOES ACCORDING TO THE 007 THING HAVE THE MAKINGS FOR A GREAT NEW  SOCIAL SECURITY S.FUL MOVIE  GOLDMITRE, IF YOU WILL, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE PRESUMING YOU ARE OUR  LOVE LORD AND SAVIOR
