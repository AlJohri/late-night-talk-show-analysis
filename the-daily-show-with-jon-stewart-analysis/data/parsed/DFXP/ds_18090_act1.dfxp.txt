FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT MR. SALOMON  RUSHDIE WILL BE JOINING US. I'M GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT  TALKING ABOUT PERKS. LITTLE JOB BENEFITS, MAYBE  THE BENEFITS OF YOUR JOB  THAT MAKE IT WORTHWHILE. THE ABILITY TO WORK FROM  HOME, PERHAPS A PERK. A MACHINE THAT DISPENSES THE  FREE COFFEE, A PERK. IMMUNITY FROM MURDER CHARGES,  A PERK. BUT AS "60 MINUTES" TAUGHT  US A YEAR AND A HALF AGO  THERE MAY BE NO BETTER PERK THAN THE ONE MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS RECEIVE.
CONGRESS LAWMAKERS HAVE  NO CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY  AND HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED EXEMPT FROM  INSIDER TRADING LAWS, EVEN  THOUGH THEY HAVE DAILY  ACCESS TO NONPUBLIC INFORMATION AND PLENTY OF  OPPORTUNITIES TO TRADE ON  IT.
IF YOU ARE ON THE SENATE  BANKING COMMITTEE, YOU CAN  TRADE BANK STOCK AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. AND THAT REGULARLY GOES ON  IN ALL THESE COMMITTEES.
Jon: INTERESTING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU  WILL--   (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MY IMPRESSION OF THE  SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE  SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE MEETING FOLLOWING SOME  CRUCIAL DECISIONS ON  FINANCIAL REGULATIONS. OKAY.
HEY, CAN WE TAKE A FIVE,  I GOT TO RUN QUICK TO CALL  MY BROKER TO MAKE A [BLEEP] OF MONEY BASED ON WHAT JUST  HAPPENED IN HERE. (LAUGHTER)
I MEAN PEE. (LAUGHTER)  I HAVE TO GO PEE. [BLEEP] LOAD OF MONEY. SO APPARENTLY THE LAW OF THE  LAND WAS IT IS ABSOLUTELY  FOREGID-- FORBIDDEN FOR  ANYONE IN AMERICA TO INSIDER TRADE UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO  BE ACCESSING THE BEST  POSSIBLE, PURIST FORM OF  INSIDE INFORMATION. IT'S LIKE SAYING NO ONE IS A  AROUND ALLOWED TO USE  RECREATIONAL DRUGS UNLESS IT IS THAT 100% PURE MEDICAL  KRAD COCAINE AND  THEN-- AMAZINGLY LAST APRIL  THAT "60 MINUTES" PIECE YIELDED RESULTS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNING  THE SO-CALLED STOCK ACT  TODAY.
NOW GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS  ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME  INSIDER TRADING RULES AS EVERYBODY ELSE.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE,  AN ACRONYM, THE STOP ACT OR  STOP TRADING ON  CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE ACT. IT WAS PASSED I GUESS  BECAUSE THE FISCAL USE OF  CONGRESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS  EXPRESSLY RESTRICTED ACT--  (LAUGHTER)
PURE ON THE NOSE. ANYWAY-- THE STOCK ACT-- IS  THERE NOTHING I CANNOT TURN  INTO VULGARITY. I AM THE MIDAS OF PROFANITY. THE STOCK ACT WAS DESIGNED  TO DO THREE THINGS. ONE, BRING A LITTLE  TRANSPARENCY TO THIS INSIDER  INFORMATION CASH GRAB  MACHINE. TWO, STOCK LAWMAKER-- STOP  LAWMAKERS AND THEIR STAFF  FROM USING SAID CASH GRAB  MACHINE AND THREE STOP WELL CONNECTED INVESTORS FROM  GAINING ACCESS TO THE INSIDE  INFORMATION CASH GRAB  MACHINE ONCE THE CONGRESSIONAL STAFF WAS THEN  USED. WELL CONNECTED INVESTORS GOT  TO IT BEFORE IT GOT TO O AM  ABOUTA'S DESK I ASSUME PURELY BY PERSUASIVE AND  RATIONAL ARGUMENTS. (LAUGHTER)  SOMETHING LIKE HEY, WHERE DO  YOU THINK ARE YOU GOING WITH  THAT MONEY MACHINE. NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH. BUT STILL T WAS A GOOD DAY.
I'M VERY PROUD TO SIGN  THIS BILL INTO LAW. I SHOULD SAY THAT OUR WORK  ISN'T DONE. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE THAT  WE CAN DO TO CLOSE THE  DEFICIT OF TRUST AND LIMIT  THE COROSSIVE INFLUENCE OF MONEY AND POLITICS.
Jon: I LOVE THAT, LIMIT  THE COROSSIVE INFLUENCE. LET'S FACE T THERE HAS TO BE  COROSSIVE INFLUENCE OF MONEY  AND POLITICS. WE'RE WEAK PEOPLE. WE WILL TRY TO LIMIT IT. LIKE THE FDA DOES WITH YOUR  FAVORITE BREAKFAST CRER  CALL-- CEREALS OF RAT POOP, IT IS GOING TO BE THERE IN. THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO  TO KEEP THAT RAT [BLEEP] OUT  OF YOUR CEREAL. YOU EAT IT AND YOU ARE LIKE  I'M MOSTLY CEREAL HERE, IT  IS VERY DEI WILL HAVE  HAVECIOUS-- DELICIOUS. I'M JUST GETTING SOME-- OF  RAT POOP AND JUST A HINT OF  THE MAGAZINEOUTS. -- MAGGOTS, BUT TWO OUT OF  THREE IS NOT BAD, HUH?
CONGRESS HAS KILLED A  MANDATE THAT CONGRESSIONAL  STAFFERS AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH EMPLOYEES POST THEIR  FINANCIAL-DISCLOSURE FORMS  ON-LINE.
Jon: WELL, ONE OUT OF  THREE IS NOT BAD. 33%, IT'S STILL A  GENTLEMAN'S F MINUS. FOR CONGRESS TO GO BACK AND  KILL THE TRANSPARENCY  FEATURE OF THIS STOCK ACT  FOR STAFFERS, MUST NOT HAVE BEEN AN EASY DECISION. I WANT TO HEAR EVERY WORD OF  THE LOUD AND PASSIONATE  SENATE FLOOR DEBATE THAT  THEY HAD THERE. PLAY THE ENTIRE THING. AND WHILE YOU DO THAT I AM  GOING TO ENJOY THIS BIG BOY  PORTION OF MY FAVORITE  BENJAMIN AND JEROMES FROZEN  TREAT.
ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT  THAT THE BILL BE RED THREE  TIMES AND PASSED THE MOTION TO RECONSIDER BE LAID ON THE  TABLE WITH NO INTERVENING  ACTION OR DEBATE.
WITHOUT OBJECTION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT DEBATE HAPPENED  SO QUICKLY I ACTUALLY HAVE  MORE ICE CREAM THAN WHEN I  STARTED. (LAUGHTER)  HMMMM, GOOD THING I'M  LACTOSE INTOLERANT. (LAUGHTER)  COMMERCIAL BREAK. ALL RIGHT. WELL LOOK, CONGRESS CAN DO  WHATEVER IT WANTS. THAT REPEAL OF THAT  TRANSPARENCY PROVISION CAN'T  GO THROUGH UNLESS THE  PRESIDENT SIGNS IT. BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO SIGN  IT, IS HE? CARNEY?
ON FRIDAY CONGRESS  QUIETLY PASSED CHANGES TO  THE STOCK ACT AND GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY GROUPS SAY THE  CHANGES BASICALLY GUT THE  LAW, THEY'RE URGING THE  PRESIDENT TO VETO-- VETS OWE IT, DOES HE PLAN TO SIGN IT  INTO LAW OR VETO IT AND WHY.
THE-- I THINK THE  PRESIDENT WAS SCHEDULED TO  SIGN THE LEGISLATION TODAY. THE-- MYLAN GAUGE HERE.
Jon: LET ME HELP YOU OUT  THERE. LET ME HELP YOU OUT THERE I  THINK THE LANGUAGE YOU MIGHT  BE LOOKING FOR IS THIS.
NBC NORTH DAKOTA NEWS,  YOUR NEWS LEADER IN HIGH  DEFINITION.
[BLEEP].
Jon: THAT JUST SAID, IS  THAT THE LANGUAGE YOU ARE  LOOKING FOR [BLEEP] (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BY THE WAY THAT GUY  FORGOT TO ADD [BLEEP] HUNTERS. (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY [BLEEP] HUNTERS  IS NOT IN DEVELOPMENT RIGHT  NOW ON COMEDY CENTRAL, SOMETHING IS REALLY WRONG  WITH THIS WORLD. OBAMA'S TRY SIGN 9  TRANSPARENCY REPEAL BECAUSE  OF CONCERNS OVER PERSONAL  SECURITY AND LAW EBB FORCEMENT ISSUES WHICH THE  COLUMBIA JOURNALISM REVIEW  RAN PAST CYBERSECURITY  EXPERT WHO DECLARED SUCH CONCERNS AND I'M QUOTING NOW,  BULL [BLEEP] YOU KNOW WHAT,  IT GIVES ME AN IDEA FOR A  MOVIE. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
