Jon: 12, THE 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS DALE DILL WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! WOW! THANK YOU! I'M AN IT IDEA. I WAS LOOKING THE WRONG WAY! I WAS LIKE, OH... AH! OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS COLIN POWELL. WAS EVERY GUEST THIS WEEK, I'LL BE HANDING HIM A CUP OF SODA AND A CUP OF WEED. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN JUST DOING THIS FOR SIX MINUTES. (LAUGHTER) HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" WE POKE A DECENT AMOUNT OF5|AF FUN AT MEDIA  FIGURES, POLITICIANS, PERHAPS AT TIMES UNFAIRLY SO. EVERY NOW AND AGAIN A POLITICIAN COMES ALONG WHO IS JUST TRULY TERRIBLE. (LAUGHTER) AND REALLY DESERVING OF MORE SCORN THAN EVEN WE CAN DOLE OUT IN OUR NIGHTLY 21:30 WISE ASS-A-THON. (LAUGHTER) I GIVE YOU FLORIDA GOVERNOR AND MR. CLEAN IMPERSONATOR-- IF MR. CLEAN HAD... (LAUGHTER) IF MR. CLEAN HAD FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON RESTRICTED HIS CALORIC INTAKE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. (LAUGHTER) RICK SCOTT. YOU MAY REMEMBER GOVERNOR SCOTT FROM HIS LAW REQUIRING ALL FLORIDA WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO BE  TESTED WHILE REFUSING TO SUBMIT TO ONE HIMSELF.
GOVERNOR, YOU BENEFIT FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY YEAR SO  WOULD YOU BE-)m WILLING TO PEE INTO THIS CUP TO PROVE TO FLORIDA TAXPAYERS THAT YOU'RE NOT ON DRUGS? NOT USING THAT MONEY FOR DRUGS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE GOVERNOR'S REFUSAL MEANT THAT AASIF MANDVI HAD TO MAKE AASIF MANDVI GOVERNOR  SMOOTHIES WITHOUT ITS SECRET INGREDIENT. (THEb GOVERNOR'S URINE) (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, GOVERNOR SCOTT'S  COST-CUTTING WELFARE PROGRAM-- WHILE DEHUMANIZING TO THOSE NEEDING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE-- DID  SAVE THE STATE OF FLORIDA... NEGATIVE $45,000. (LAUGHTER) WELL, NOW THE GOVERNOR AND FORMER LEAD SINGER OF MIDNIGHT  OIL HAS TURNED HIS ATTENTION... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ... TO AN EVEN MORE PRESSING ISSUE: FLORIDA'S VAST STORES OF  REGISTERED YET INELIGIBLE VOTERS.
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SAYS FLORIDA'S VOTER PURGE IF YOU WILL, IS AIMED AT  CLEARING REGISTRATION RULES OF NON-CITIZENS.
Jon: WOW. PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FEAR OF DEPORTATION YET INSIST ON VOTING. (LAUGHTER) THERE MUST BE TENS OF THOSE. (LAUGHTER) BUT HEY WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THOSE PEOPLE OFF YOUR VOTER  ROLES, I'M SURE THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
THE MIAMI "HERALD" HAVE FOUND "HISPANIC, DEMOCRATIC AND  INDEPENDENT-MINDED VOTERS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE TARGETED BY THE STATE'S PURGE."
Jon: SO, NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. (LAUGHTER) VOTEER PURGE DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETS HISPANICS. RIGHT ABOUT NOW BLACK PEOPLE IN FLORIDA HAVE TO BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES. (LAUGHTER) NOTHING BEING DONE TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE POLLS.
IN FLORIDA, THE EARLY VOTING PERIOD HAS BEEN CUT FROM 14 DAYS  DOWN TO EIGHT AND ELIMINATES THE SUNDAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY.
AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITES TO VOTE EARLY. IN FACT, THE SUNDAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY THERE ARE DRIVES BY THE CHURCHES TO GET OUT THE:mz VOTE  BECAUSE THE POLLS ARE OPEN THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION.
Jon: WHY CAN'T THEY JUST GO TO CHURCH ON SATURDAY LIKE THE REST OF FLORIDA? (LAUGHTER) A VOTER PURGE WEIGHTED AGAINST HISPANIC VOTERS, CLOSING THE POLLS ON A DAY MANY AFRICAN  AMERICAN VOTERS CAST THEIR BALLOTS. NICE TRY, GOVERNOR! AND TALLER OF THE TWO TWIN PEAKS BACKWARDS TALKING GUYS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT, GOVERNOR, YOU HEARD ME! YOU MILDLY RESEMBLE CHARACTER ACTOR CAROL FRANKEN. BOOM! IT'S THAT EASY! ANYWAY YOUR LITTLE PLAN DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE YOU FORGOT TO SUPPRESS ANOTHER POWERFUL INFLUX  VOTERS-- THE NEWLY REGISTERED.
FLORIDA'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SIGNED A NEW LAW LAST  YEAR, ANYONE WHO REGISTERS VOTERS IN THE STATE HAVE TO HAND IN ALL COMPLETED FORMS NO LATER  THAN 48 HOURS TO THE MINUTE AFTER THE APPLICANTS HAVE ORIGINALLY FILLED THEM OUT.
Jon: IS THAT TOUR FROM LAW NECESSARY? HOW WOULD IT EVEN WORK? WE SENT JOHN OLIVER TO&lt;ï¿½ï¿½ FLORIDA TO INVESTIGATE.
MOST RATIONAL PEOPLE VIEW FLORIDA'S NEW TOUR FROM VOTER REGISTRATION LAW AS A  COMMON-SENSED BULWARK AGAINST FRAUD. BUT SOME CRACKPOTS LIKE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS PRESIDENT DIEDRE McNABB FAIL TO SEE HOW  GREAT IT IS.
THIS TOUR FROM TIMELINE I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER. OUR VOLUNTEERS DON'T HAVE TIME TO RUN DOWN TO THEIR SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS OFFICE EVERY TIME  WE GET VOTER REGISTRATIONS.
BUT YOU CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH THOSE FORMS FOR LONGER THAN 48 HOURS.
I THINK OUR RECORD OF 72 YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS, BLEMISH-FREE RECORD SHOWS THAT WE ARE TRUSTWORTHY.
WELL, 72 YEARS OF NOT GETTING CAUGHT AND FOR THAT I'LL CONGRATULATE YOU. (LAUGHTER)
THANK YOU.
AND BECAUSE OF THIS LAW, THIRD-PARTY REGISTRATION GROUPS LIKE THE LEAGUE HAVE LEFT FLORIDA AND NEW VOTER  REGISTRATIONS ARE DOWN ALMOST 20%. BUT THEï¿½ï¿½g THIS IS A NECESSARY SACRIFICE TO PROTECT THE SANTTY OF OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS.
IT'S A BALANCE. WE WANT TO MAKE IT'S EASY TO VOTE AND HARD TO CHEAT. I THINK THIS WILL HELP IN THAT EFFORT.
SO YOU WANT TO INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT BYPASSING THIS LAW EVEN  THOUGH IT DECREASES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE REGISTERING TO VOTE.
FIRST OF ALL, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO. IT JUST DOES. (LAUGHTER) SFRNLT WELL, THE POINT IS ANY AMOUNT OF VOTER FRAUD IS TOO MUCH.
EXACTLY! AND SACRIFICING 20% OF NEWyKï¿½ VOTER PARTICIPATION IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE HORRORS OF VOTER  FRAUD WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE, HAPPENS AT A TERRIFYING RATE OF .0004%! (LAUGHTER)
ANY GROUP THAT COMES UP WITH A NUMBER THAT SPECIFIC IS BLOWING SMOKE THROUGH THEIR ASS.
RIGHT. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF SPECIFIC NUMBERS.
LOOK, THE DETECTED VOTER FRAUD THAT YOU PROSECUTE AND PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR MAY BE ONE NUMBER. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VOTER FRAUD OUT THERE YOU CAN NEVER CATCH  BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO DO!
SO VOTER FRAUD STATISTICS ARE LIMITED ONLY AS MUCH AS YOUR IMAGINATION. (LAUGHTER) AND THE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CATCH FRAUD-- LIKE ELECTIONS  SUPERVISOR ANN McFALL COULDN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL TO HAVE THIS LAW IN PLACE.
THE LAW DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I DON'T SEE THE FRAUD IN VOTER REGISTRATION. IT JUST ISN'T HAPPENING.
BUT, ANNE, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT VOTER FRAUD THAT HAS HAPPENED. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VOTER FRAUD THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE IDEAS?
JOHN FUND.
WHO?
HAVING A SHORT WINDOW SO YOU HAVE TO TURN IN THE FORM QUICKLY LESSEN IT IS CHANCE FOR MISCHIEF.
RIGHT. MISCHIEF.
THESE ARE GOVERNMENT FORMS. WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT THEM FLOATING OUT THERE FOR TOO LONG.
IF YOU GIVE THEM ANYTHING LONGER THAN 48 HOURS THEY WILL GO ON A HELL-BOUND BENDER THAT  YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW. BUT THE LONGER YOU DON'T TURN SOMETHING IN THE MORE YOU JUST MISPLACE IT ACCIDENTALLY. YOU DON'T TURN SOME OF THEM IN IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM. THERE'S A DANGER. THEY COULD MISUSE THAT INFORMATION.
WELL, THAT 48 HOURS NOW SEEMS FAR TOO LONG. WHAT ABOUT 12 HOURS? SURE THEY'S MUCH SAFER.
THE POINT IS THEY MADE IT 48 HOURS. THAT
THAT'S THE PERFECT BALANCE OF HOURS.
YES.
HE WAS RIGHT. FLORIDA LAWMAKERS HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO STOP ALL THIS POST-TOUR FROM MISCHIEF.
WHAT!
IT'S A FIGMENT OF YOUR IMAGINATION.
EXACTLY! AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY IMAGINATION. CLOSE YOUR EYES. IMAGINE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF CASES OF VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ CAN YOU SEE IT?
NO.
SO YOU DON'T SEE A GOAT WALKING OFF WITH A VOTER REGISTRATION FORM?
NO, NOT IN THIS STATE.
BUT, ANNE, NO OFFENSE, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT.
THAT SHOWS YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR HOME WORK. I'M A REPUBLICAN.
REGARDLESS, THE FRAUD DENIERS IN THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE MANAGED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND  THIS TOUR FROM RULE, LEAVING GROUPS LIKE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS FREE TO GET INTO  HYPOTHETICAL MISCHIR LIKE THIS. THIS HASN'T HAPPENED AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AND THAT IS WHY IT MUST BE STOPPED.
