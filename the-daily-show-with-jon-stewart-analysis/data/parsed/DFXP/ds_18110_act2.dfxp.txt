Jon: WELCOME BACK. SUMMER IS ALMOST HERE. A TIME TO FIND SOMETHING TO  WORRY ABOUT FOR THE NEXT  MONTH. WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE, GAS  PRICES, --
THE DEATH TOLL IS RISING  FROM A NEWLY DISCOVERED  RESPIRATORY VIRUS.
THE WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION IS CALLING IT A  SPREAD THE WORLD.
SPREADING LIKE WILDFIRE  NO PREVENTION, NO CURE.
MUSCLE ACHES THEN  CONFUSION, RAPIDLY BREATHING  BECOMES DIFFICULT.
OH MY GOTH, I HAVE ALL  THOSE SYMPTOMS. I GOT THEM.
I'M NOT A MICROBIOLOGIST  SO IN THIS STORY I DON'T  NEED TO SEE YOUR VIRUS SORE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. I HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT  PICTURE MEANS WE'RE ALL  GOING TO DIE OR  CONGRATULATIONS. SO WHAT VIRUS IS THIS, H1N1,  YOUR SARS, GLARS, FLORPS.
IT'S CALLED MERS.
DEADLY MERS.
MERS.
MERS.
MERS.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING IT  MIGHT NOT-- MER. COME BACK OVER HERE. I NEVER KNOW, ARE YOU  SUPPOSED TO HEAR THAT, MER,  DA, DA, DA, OR IS IT  SUPPOSED TO GO MER, DA, DA,  DA. IT IS AN ESSENCE, LIKE BEST --
SO IS THIS THE NEW VIRUS  WHERE DID IT EVEN COME FROM.
THE ORIGINAL REPORTS THE  VIRUS STARTS FROM A BAT. AND WE THINK BASED ON OUR  ANALYSIS, THAT IT ALSO CAME  FROM BATS.
WAIT A SECOND, IF IT CAME  FROM BATS HOW DID WE GET IT. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE IF SO, I AM IN BIG  TROUBLE. (LAUGHTER)
SO WE DON'T QUITE KNOW  HOW IT SPREADS WHETHER YOU  BREATHE IT IN FROM ANOTHER PERSON OR A FLUID EXCHANGE. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THAT?
I THINK OUR BEST GUEST IN  THIS VIRUS INCUBATES ON A  WALL MAN TER BEHIND THE HOST OF A NEWS SHOW. (LAUGHTER)
AND THEN JUMPS TO THEIR  NECK REGION. WE'RE ALL GOING DIE AT THE  HANDS OF SOME SORT OF CRAZY  BAT.
THERE ARE 53 KNOWN CASES  NOW, 30 PEOPLE HAVE DIED  FROM THE INFECTION SINCE  SEPTEMBER.
OVER 1500 PATIENTS, MORE  THAN 80,000 PEOPLE HAVE  DIED.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL  THAT ON GAME OF THRONES, A  WEDDING.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. OH, I'M SORRY, SPOILER  ALERT. READ THE BOOK. THERE'S A LOT MORE WHERE  THAT CAME FROM, MISTER. SO WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS ABOUT,  MY FRIENDS.
HA, HA. ENJOY YOUR MERS, PEOPLE,  WHATEVER THAT STANDS FOR.
MIDDLE EASTERN-- CAUGHT  FROM CLOSE CONTACT WITH  SOMEONE.
THE MIDDLE EAST RES  PRACTICE STORE-- RESPIRATORY  SYNDROME CORONA VIRUS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
