JANUARY 13TH, 2014 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS  IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE HAVE A SHOW -- TONIGHT MY GUEST ROGER ROSS WILLIAMS. HE'S GOT HIS DOCUMENTARY "GOD LOVES UGANDA." HE'LL BE ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR TOP STORY-- I APOLOGIZE, I'M PARCHED, I'M A LITTLE PARCHED. LET ME JUST, VERY QUICKLY I APOLOGIZE I JUST HAVE MY WATER FLOWN IN EVERY MORNING BECAUSE I'M VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT MY WATER. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE IT FLOWN IN EVERY -- AHHHH. EVERY MORNING THEY FLY IT IN FROM WEST VIRGINIA, MY WATER AND I -- [LAUGHTER] FILTERED DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF APPALACHIA THROUGH THE CRISP CLEAR STREAMS, THROUGH THE RESERVOIRS, I LOVE THIS STUFF. THE ICE IS EVEN MADE FROM WEST VIRGINIA. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE ONE BIT DILUTED. 100% PURE WEST VIRGINIA TRANSPARENT GOLD. LET ME JUST TAKE A SIZABLE GULP WHILE YOU WATCH THIS CLIP.
TONIGHT 300,000 PEOPLE IN WEST VIRIGINA ARE BEING TOLD TO STAY AWAY FROM THEIR TAP WATER, NOT TO USE IT FOR ANYTHING. A CHEMICAL SPILL IN THE ELK RIVER MAY HAVE CONTAMINATED THE DRINKING WATER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SORRY, I WAS ENJOYING THIS DELICIOUS WATER SO MUCH I MISSED WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. WHAT WERE THEY SAYING?
A CHEMICAL SPILL IN THE ELK RIVER MAY HAVE CONTAMINATED THE DRINKING WATER.
Jon: OKAY, I HEARD IT THAT TIME. [LAUGHTER] COME TO THINK OF IT, I DID TASTE SOMETHING JUST A SKOSH DIFFERENT. AN UNDERTONE JUST A SOUS SANT, JUST A NOTE OF OF OF --
RESIDENTS KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN THEIR WATER STARTED SMELLING LIKE LICORICE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YES THERE WAS THE FAINT SMELL OF LICORICE AND ALSO THE WATER GAVE THEM EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA AND VOMITING. SO HOW DO YOU GET LICORICE-FLAVORED POLLUTED WATER  WITH A FRACKING IN CANDY LAND? HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?
THE CRISIS BEGAN WHEN A TOXIC CHEMICAL USED TO PROCESS COAL LEAKED OUT OF A 48,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE CHEMICAL OVERFLOWED INTO THE ELK RIVER JUST NORTH OF A WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT PROVIDES DRINKING WATER FOR THE REGION.
Jon: OK I AM NOT AN INDUSTRIAL  ENGINEER OR AN EXPERT IN SEWAGE TREATMENT OR A CITY PLANNER, OR A DOCTOR OR A MOYLE -- BUT WHY -- [LAUGHTER] -- WHY WOULD YOU BUILD YOUR TOXIC CHEMICAL STORAGE TANKS UPSTREAM -- [LAUGHTER] -- AND DRINKING WATER ADJACENT? ALTHOUGH I IMAGINE BECAUSE IT WAS IN SUCH A VULNERABLE POSITION IT WAS HIGHLY REGULATED.
THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL STORAGE FACILITY.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND  THESE TOXIC CHEMICAL TANKS HAVE BEEN INSPECTED AS RECENTLY AS UH, [CLEARS THROAT] 1991. 1991? ARE YOU --1991? THAT'S LIKE SIX BATMANS AGO. 1991. THAT IS NOT EVEN THE MOST RECENT PALINDROME YEAR. YEAH, THAT WOULD BE 2002. I THINK I PROBABLY JUST BLEW UP A NERD'S BRAIN. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY THE POINT IS THIS:  APPARENTLY THERE ARE VERY FEW REGULATIONS VIS-A-VIS THE  RIVERFRONT STORAGE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS IN THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA. SO IN LIEU OF SAID SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, THE STATE'S GOVERNOR HAD SOME POST CAUTIONS.
DO NOT DRINK IT. DO NOT COOK WITH IT. DO NOT WASH CLOTHES IN IT. DO NOT TAKE A BATH IN IT.
Jon: DO NOT FEED IT THROUGH A HOSE CONNECTED TO A SPRINKLER WHICH YOU THEN RUN THROUGH GOING WHEE. [LAUGHTER] DO NOT FREEZE IT INTO A BLOCK OF ICE AND THEN  STAND ON IT TO HANG YOURSELF CREATING A BAFFLING LOCKED ROOM MYSTERY. DO NOT STORE YOUR ADOLESCENT TURTLES IN IT, UNLESS YOU WANT SAID TURTLES TO GROW LARGE AND BECOME PROLIFIC -- [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY THAT HAS CLEARLY EXPLOITED THE LACK OF SCRUTINY AND REGULATION OF THE TOXIC CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SINCE 1991?
A COMPANY CALLED FREEDOM INDUSTRIES.
Jon: ARE YOU (bleep) KIDDING ME? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE. WHY NOT? WHY NOT IN REALITY HAVE IT NAMED THE SAME AS IT WOULD BE IN THE SATIRICAL HBO MOVIE ABOUT A TOXIC CHEMICAL COMPANY. NOW OF COURSE, ANY TIME SOMETHING INCREDIBLY TOXIC IS RELEASED INTO AMERICA'S WATERS, A BRITISH PERSON HAS TO APPEAR AND APOLOGIZE FOR IT WHETHER IT BE THE HEAD OF BP TO THE GULF OR PIERS MORGAN LEAVING A POOL PARTY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID (bleep). LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FREEDOM INDUSTRIES' GARY SOUTHERN.
THIS INCIDENT IS EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE, UNANTICIPATED AND WE ARE VERY, VERY SORRY FOR THE DISRUPTION TO EVERYBODY'S DAILY LIFE THAT THIS INCIDENT HAS CAUSED.
Jon: ON THE PLUS SIDE, LOOK HOW MUCH EASIER IT IS TO FISH NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU JUST SCOOP! [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE WE GO TO JASON JONES LIVE TONIGHT IN WEST VIRGINIA'S KANAWHA COUNTY. JASON JONES, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LISTEN TO ME! PLEASE, YOU CAN IF YOU WANT. I DON'T CARE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JASON FIVE DAYS NOW WITHOUT  WATER. THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA MUST BE PRETTY --
THIRSTY, JON. THEY'RE THIRSTY. AND ALSO FILTHY. THIRSTY AND FILTHY BUT MOST OF ALL ANGRY. THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY WE WERE WARNED THIS WAS COMING.
AN AGGRESSOR NATION OR EXTREMIST GROUP COULD CONTAMINATE THE WATER SUPPLY.
THE POTENTIAL TO LEAVE ENTIRE CITIES OR ENTIRE REGIONS WITH CONTAMINATED WATER.
THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTS UNCOVERED THAT POINT TO AL QAEDA WANTING TO HIT OUR WATER SUPPLY.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS ENHANCED INTERROGATION TIME. BUT LISTEN NO WATERBOARDING WE'RE DOWN TO OUR LAST BOTTLE OF POLAND SPRING.
Jon: JASON, JASON. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY ONE OUR PROGRAM'S FINEST JOURNALISTS.
YES, I AM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO YOU KNOW THIS WAS IN NO WAY A TERROR ATTACK.
OF COURSE IT WAS WHICH IS WHY WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES, SPEND WHATEVER IT COSTS, INVADE ANY COUNTRY THAT MIGHT BE HARBORING THESE MONSTERS AND SUSPEND WHICHEVER ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT TAKES UNTIL WE'RE SAFE AGAIN.
Jon: JASON IT WASN'T TERRORISM. NO DON'T LISTEN TO  THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WASN'T TERRORISM! THIS WAS AN INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT.
INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT?
Jon: YES
SO WHAT THE [BLEEP] AM I DOING HERE?
Jon: WHAT NO, JASON, NO, COME BACK.
WHAT?
Jon: THERE'S STILL A JUICY STORY HERE. THESE CHEMICAL TANKS HADN'T BEEN INSPECTED IN 23 YEARS. THIS DISASTER COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH SIMPLE COMMON SENSE REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA AND LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICE STATE. I WOULD RATHER DRINK A WHOLE VAT OF TOXIC LICORICE SLUDGE.
Jon: YOU MUST AGREE SOMEONE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WELL OBVIOUSLY. NOW FIRST OF ALL WE NEED A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE AND FIRE THE C.I.A. AND N.S.A. AGENTS WHO FAILED TO CONNECT THE DOTS.
Jon: JASON, JASON IT WAS NOT TERRORISM!
I FORGOT YOU SAID THAT, YEAH. WHY THE (bleep) AM I HERE? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JASON JONES, EVERYBODY WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
