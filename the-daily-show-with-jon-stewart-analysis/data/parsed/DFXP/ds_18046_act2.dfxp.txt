Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN BOLD  ACTION WITH HIS RECENT EXECUTIVE  ACTION BUT NOT EVERY IDEA COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WORKS OUT  AS PLAN.
WE'RE LAUNCHING AN ONLINE  TOOL CALLED WE THE PEOPLE TO  ALLOW THE AMERICANS TO DIRECTLY PETITION THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: HAVE YOU MET US? IT WAS THE GRANDEST EXPERIENCE  IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY SINCE  JEFFERSON ALLOW EVER AMERICAN TO SUGGEST POLICY AFTER THE CARRIER  PIGEON WAS DISCONTINUED FOR  HYGIENIC REGIONS. THAT PHOTO WAS NOT RETOUCHED. IT WAS A NOBLE EFFORT. ONLY 5,000 SIGNATURES NEEDED TO  GET AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT  RESPONSE WHICH WAS A LOW BALL. DID THEY NOT HOW THE INTERNET  WORK? 5,000. THE KONY2012 PETITION GOT NINE  MILLION HITS. COULD YOU GET A PETITION TO  LEAVE KONY ALONE FOR 5,000.
ONE CRITIC OF GUN LAWS IS  PIERS MORGAN. OVER 80, TO HAVE SIGNED REQUESTS  TO DEPORT HIM FOR ENGAGING IN A  HOSTILE ATTACK AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION BY TARGETING THE  SECOND AMENDMENT.
Jon: OKAY. I'M A LITTLE TORN ON THIS ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] ON THE ONE HAND IT'S A WASTE OF  THE GOVERNMENT'S TIME BUT ON THE  OTHER HAND -- [ LAUGHTER ] WE DO MISS LARRY KING EVERY NOW  AND AGAIN. MAYBE THERE'S AN EASIER ONE.
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS IN 20  STATES NOW THAT HAVE SIGNED PETITIONS AT WHITE WHITEHOUSEGOV TO  ALLOW THEIR STATE TO PEACEFULLY  SECEDE FROM THE UNION.
Jon: REALLY TORN ON THIS  ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE THERE ANY THAT MAYBE I  WOULDN'T BE TORN ABOUT ON THIS  WEB SITE?
ONE PETITION CALLED ON THE  WHITE HOUSE TO BEGIN  CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEATH STAR.
IT RECEIVED 40,000 SIGNATURES  WHICH MEANS THE ADMINISTRATION  HAD TO COMMENT AND SAID, THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SUPPORT  BLOWING UP PLANETS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THE ADMINISTRATION R  THEY ON TAPE SAYING THAT BECAUSE  THAT SOUNDS LIKE (bleep). WE'VE GOT DRONES AND THOSE ARE  JUST LIKE BABY ONES. I GUARANTEE THEY ARE WORKING ON  ONE BUT AT LEAST THE WHITE HOUSE  HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT.
STARTING TODAY A PETITION  SENT TO THE WEBSITE WE THE  PEOPLE HAS TO HAVE 100,000 SIGNATURES IN THE SPAN OF 30  DAYS TO GET AN OFFICIAL  RESPONSE.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOING  ON YOU KEEP VOTING TO RAISE THE  SIGNATURE CEILING AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO KEEP HITTING IT  OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHY NOT ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC  PROBLEM MAINLY PEOPLE LOVE  SIGNING UP FOR (bleep) ON THE  INTERNET. 100,000 ISN'T GOING TO SLOW US  DOWN. I HAVE A PETITION RIGHT NOW  TODAY THAT I DEMAND THAT THE  U.S. GOVERNMENT ADDRESS. I DEMAND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  GIVE EVERYONE IN AMERICA A FAKE  TWITTER GIRLFRIEND. WE CAN DO THIS, PEOPLE! 100,000 SIGNIFICANT IN TOURS. WE'LL GET -- SIGNATURES. WE'LL GET COLBERT ON BOARD. WE CAN DO.
