Jon: BOOM. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY. JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
JON STEWART, YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! STEPHEN! (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT A PLEASANT SPRIDZ SURPRISE. I WAS JUST....
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE, JON.
Jon: VALENTINE'S DAY ISN'T FOR TWO WEEKS.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO ME.
Jon: THE IMMERSION BLENDER IS FOR MY BUTTERNUT SQUASH. YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT SUPER PAC BACK, COLBERT.
I WANT MY UNLIMITED MONEY, JON.
Jon: I TREAT THAT MONEY WELL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT MONEY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. THAT MONEY LOVES ME NOW.
I RAISED THAT MONEY FROM A BABY. I SUCKALED THAT MONEY. AT MY TEATS.
Jon: IF THAT MONEY HAD STAYED WITH YOU, IT WOULD BE A CRACK WHORE RUNNING AROUND THE  CITY, WORKING THE POLE AT A FLUZY JOINT. I TAUGHT THAT MONEY MANNERS.
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU WANT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR RANSOM, I CAN TELL YOU I DON'T HAVE MONEY. BUT WHAT I DO ARE A VERY PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS, SKILLS THAT I'VE ACQUIRED OVER A VERY LONG CAREER. SKILLS THAT MAKE ME A NIGHTMARE FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU. IF YOU LET MY SUPER PAC GO NOW, THAT WILL BE THE END OF IT. I WILL NOT LOOK FOR YOU. I WILL NOT PURSUE YOU. BUT IF YOU DON'T, I WILL LOOK FOR YOU AND I WILL FIND YOU JUST LIKE LIAM NEESON WHO SAID  THIS MONOLOGUE IN "TAKEN." (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: STEPHEN, WHY DON'T YOU... I DIDN'T KNOW IT MEANT THAT MUCH TO YOU. HERE, LET ME JUST GET... YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I LEFT IT AT THE... HOLD ON. I THINK... WHERE'S THE (BEEP)? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  â™ª AHA. JOHN OLIVER. OH, MY GOD. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.

I WOULD.
OH, I'M
