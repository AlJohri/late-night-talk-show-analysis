WELCOME BACK. FOOTBALL SEASON IS OVER. WITH FOOTBALL SEASON OVER IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO ITS SECOND FAVORITE SPORT, WAITING FOR FOOTBALL SEASON TO START AGAIN. WE LEARNED NEXT YEAR MAY COME WITH AN EXCITING TWIST.
MICHAEL SAM HAS REVEALED HE IS GAY. THE 24-YEAR-OLD EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN EARLY ROUND OF THE NFL DRAFT COME APRIL IS POISED TO BECOME PRO FOOTBALL'S FIRST OPENLY GAY PLAYER.
WE COULD HAVE THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PROFESSIONAL PLAYER. THERE HASN'T BEEN A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT SO SIGNIFICANT SINCE THE NFL WELCOMED THE FIRST OPENLY BAD PLAYER. IT'S AMAZING TO ME. [LAUGHTER] WHO IS THIS GAY FOOTBALL PLAYER, PROBABLY A KICKER, HUH? AM I RIGHT A KICKER. YOU KNOW HE'S A GAY KICKER, NOT LIKE A REAL PLAYER.
AT SIX TWO 260 POUNDS UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI DEFENSIVE LINEMAN MICHAEL SAM USED SKILL AND STRENGTH TO LEAD THE SEC IN SACKS LAST YEAR.
HE WAS THE DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR THE BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER IN THE BEST CONFERENCE IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT'S AS THOUGH SEXUAL ORIENTATION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PHYSICAL STRENGTH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOOD FOR HIM FOR COMING OUT IN A SPORT NOT EXACTLY KNOWN FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE OF GAY PEOPLE AND COLLEGE TEAMMATES DESERVE CREDIT AS WELL.
SAM A PROJECTED MID ROUND NFL PICK WHO PLAYED IN COLLEGE FOR MISSOURI TOLD HIS COACH AND TEAMMATES ABOUT HIS SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN AUGUST.
I WAS KIND OF SCARED EVEN THOUGH THEY ALREADY KNEW I WAS STILL SCARED TO TELL THEM. SEEING THE REACTION WAS AWESOME AND THEY SUPPORTED ME FROM DAY ONE.
Jon: SAM TOLD HIS TEAMMATES LAST AUGUST HE WAS GAY AND  EVERYBODY KEPT IT RESPECTFULLY PRIVATE WHICH MEANS COLLEGE HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE I WAS -- [LAUGHTER] -- IN COLLEGE. [LAUGHTER]
THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI TWEETED ITS SUPPORT FOR SAM SAYING WE SUPPORT TIGERS OF ALL STRIPES AT MISSOU, PROUD OF YOU MIKE SAM.
Jon: JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU, DESPITE WHAT MIGHT BE THE HEARTLAND'S REPUTATION THEY'LL WELCOME ANYONE NO MATTER HOW DIFFERENT IF YOU ARE REALLY GOOD AT FOOTBALL. I USED TO THINK GAYNESS WAS A SIN AGAINST GOD. I USED TO THINK GAYNESS WAS A SIN BUT I SAW THE KID PLAY AND I'M THINKING I SHOULD (bleep) PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT GOOD AT FOOTBALL. MICHAEL SAM MIGHT FIND A LESS WARM WELCOME FROM AT LEAST SOME PLAYERS.
SAINTS LINEBACKER JONATHAN VILMA TALKED ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF A GAY TEAMMATE.
IMAGINE IF HE'S THE GUY NEXT TO ME AND I GET DRESSED NAKED, TAKING A SHOWER THE WHOLE NINE AND HE LOOKS AT ME. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RESPOND.
Jon: WHAT? YOU KNOW, IT'S SO WEIRD HOW SOME GUYS JUST ASSUME THAT THEY ARE SO IRRESISTIBLE TO GAY GUYS. HOW COULD HE NOT BE ATTRACTED TO ME. I GUESS I'M SAYING I'M THE TOTAL PACKAGE. I'M RIPPED. MY ASS IS AS TIGHT AS TWO SNARE DRUMS. I COULDN'T RESIST. IT'S ALL CAN I DO TO STOP FROM (bleep) RIGHT HERE LOOKING AT MYSELF. I'M UNBELIEVABLE. I'M A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL MAN. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, ASSUMING MICHAEL SAM EVEN GETS AN ON NFL TEAM.
SPORTS ILLUSTRATED DID AN ARTICLE WHERE THEY TALKED TO PERSONNEL DIRECTORS AND THERE ARE MANAGERS WHO SAY THE DRAFT PROSPECTS WILL DROP THE BECAUSE OF REVELATIONS THE TEAMS DON'T WANT THE CONTROVERSY THAT WILL SURROUND THIS.
Jon: PLEASE, NO PRO TEAM WANTS THE CONTROVERSY HAVING A GAY PLAYER IS GOING TO CAUSE. IF HE WAS JUST CONVICTED OF DUI VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER OR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN CONNECTION OF A MURDER OR SCREAMED THE N WORD AT A CONCERT OR KILLED A BUNCH OF DOGS OR BURIED THEM IN HIS (bleep) YARD, YOU KNOW -- NFL MATERIAL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
