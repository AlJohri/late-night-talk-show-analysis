(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED RETIREMENT  HEISTS, HOW COMPANIES PLUNDER AND PROFIT FROM THE NEST EGGS OF AMERICAN WORKERS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ELLEN SCHULTZ. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED RETIREMENT HEIST. I DID NOT THINK... AND I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS. I DID NOT THINK THERE WAS ANOTHER PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT I CAN LEARN THAT COULD  STILL MAKE ME ANGRY. THANK YOU.
ANY TIME.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW I CAN STILL FEEL. THIS BOOK IS ABOUT HOW CORPORATIONS HAVE TAKEN GIGANTIC WORKER PENSION FUNDS AND JUST TAKEN THEM.
THEY'VE MANAGEDED TO TAKE THE RETIREMENT PLANS FOR MILLIONS, 44 MILLION PEOPLE, AND TURN THEM INTO PROFIT CENTERS FOR THE COMPANIES. NOW PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING THAT THE PLANS ARE UNDERFUNDED BUT THEY WERE FULLY FUNDED. IN FACT THERE WAS A QUARTER TRILLION SURPLUS AS RECENTLY AS TEN YEARS AGO.
Jon: WHAT WOULD THEY DO? YOU SAY THE PENSION FUND HAS A SURPLUS. THAT MEANS THE COMPANY, THE WORKERS PAY INTO IT. THERE'S A MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO FUND THESE PENSIONS. SO THEY HAVE A QUARTER TRILLION SURPLUS. HOW DID THEY DRAIN THAT? WHAT DID THEY DO?
A NUMBER OF THINGS. THEY SYPHONED MONEY OUT TO PAY FOR RESTRUCTURING, I.E., GETTING RID OF OLD PEOPLE. THEY USED SOME OF IT TO PAY THEIR EXECUTIVES, PARACHUTES.
Jon: IF YOU GET A GOLDEN PARACHUTE AS THEY CALL IT, THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THE PENSION FUND THAT THEY HAVE SET ASIDE FOR WORKERS.
THERE ARE WAYS TO DO THAT, YES. IT'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REALLY TRICKY LOOPHOLES. THEY ACTUALLY ALSO SOLD US IN DEALS.
Jon: M-AND-A, OBVIOUSLY YOU AND ARE INSIDERS.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU COULD SELL A UNIT AND THEN JUST SELL THEM SOME OF THE EXTRA PENSION.
Jon: SO YOU WOULD, LET'S SAY, COME IN AND BUY A COMPANY. AND PART OF THAT COMPANY IS WE HAVE $2 BILLION IN PENSION. AND YOU TAKE THAT AND DO WHAT WITH IT?
YOU TAKE IT BUT THEN YOU GET ANOTHER $500 MILLION EXTRA. YOU JUST PAY 7 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR THAT.
Reporter: YOU DON'T PAY THEM THE PENSIONS THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET. YOU PAY THEM LESS. AND THAT EXTRA MONEY YOU PUT ON YOUR LEDGER AS PROFIT.
YOU CAN KEEP SOME OF THAT EXTRA MONEY, YES. TRUE, ALL OF THESE MECHANISMS COMPANIES TOOK WHAT WAS REALLY A PERFECTLY HEALTHY SYSTEM AND  JUST RAN THEM INTO THE ROUND. THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE COST OF THE RETIREES.
Jon: WHY CAN YOU DO THAT?
WELL, THERE ARE LOTS OF CLEVER LOOPHOLES. AND COMPANIES HAVE CONVINCED CONGRESS TO LET THEM DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS OVER THE YEARS  CLAIMING IT WAS GOOD FOR RETIREMENT SECURITY. WHAT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING IS THAT WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS FOR EVERYBODY, THEY WERE  BOOSTING THE PENSIONS FOR THE EXECUTIVES SO ALL OF THESE CHANGES WHICH DECIMATED THE  RETIREMENT PLANS FOR MILLIONS WERE BOOSTING THE PAY AND THE PENSIONS FOR THE TOP 1%.
Jon: IT MAKES ME WANT TO A (BEEP) ON A POLICE CAR. AND I SAY THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. I KNOW THE POLICE ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN. (GRUNTING) WHY ISN'T THIS MORE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE? IT'S SURPRISING TO ME THAT THIS ENORMOUS... ALL WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IS THESE  CORPORATIONS HAVING TO RENEGOTIATE WITH THEIR WORKERS THE IDEA THAT YOUR RETIREMENT  FUND IS THE ALBATROSS AROUND THE COMPANY'S NECK.
THEY HAVE MANAGED TO KEEP THIS PRETTY QUIET OVER THE YEARS. IT'S COMPLICATED MANEUVERS AND COMPANIES HAVE DELIBERATELY DECEIVED PEOPLE. THEY'VE DECEIVED THE EMPLOYEES AND CONGRESS. I'LL GIVE YOU ON AN EXAMPLE. ONE WAY THEY FINANCE THESE HUGE EXECUTIVE PENSIONS WHICH SOME COMPANIES LIKE GE IS IS  UP TO $6 BILLION.
Jon: UP TO $6 BILLION IN?
EXECUTIVE PENSIONS.
Jon: $6 BILLION IN EXECUTIVE PENSIONS.
THAT'S HOW MUCH THEY OWE THEIR EXECUTIVES.
Jon: $6 BILLION.
YES. THEY EARNED IT.
Jon: HOW MANY EXECUTIVES? DO THEY HAVE SIX BILLION EXECUTIVES?
THEY DON'T DISCLOSE IT BUT WHAT THEY OWE THEM IS ABOUT 15% OF WHAT THEY TO 500,000.
Jon: THAT COUNTS AGAINST EVERYBODY ELSE'S FUNDED PENSIONS?
IT COUNTS AS PART OF THE LIABILITY, SURE. SO WHEN COMPANIES COMPLAIN ABOUT THEIR COSTLY RETIREES THEY OFTEN DON'T POINT OUT THE  FACT THAT IT'S THE EXECUTIVES THAT ARE COSTLY. LIKE OMNI CARE, WHEN THE EXECUTIVE RETIRED HE GOT $100 MILLION BUT THEY FROZE THE  PLAN FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. FINANCING THIS STUFF THOUGH IS WHAT REALLY SURPRISEDED ME. THEY HAVE TAKEN OUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LIFE INSURANCE ON WORKERS AND THEY USE THE  LIFE INSURANCE AS EXECUTIVE PENSION FUNDS.
Jon: WHO TOOK OUT LIFE INSURANCE ON THE WORKERS.
NESTLE, WAL-MART, DISNEY.
Jon: YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TAKE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON A WORKER. DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON THEM?
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THESE DAYS BUT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA.
Jon: CAN I JUST LIKE GO OUN THE STREET AND GO, THAT GUY IS OLD. I'M GOING TO TAKE OUT A POLICY ON HIM? HOW CAN YOU HOLD A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ON SOMEONE WHO IS NOT IN YOUR FAMILY?
INITIALLY THEY WERE SAYING TO CONGRESS, WELL, IF WE LOSE A PART-TIME CLERK WHO HAS NO  BENEFITS IT'S GOING TO COST US MONEY TO HAVE TO RETRAIN THEM. CONGRESS SAID SURE DO THAT. CONGRESS GOT TIRED OF THAT. THEN THEY CONVINCED CONGRESS THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO PAY FOR RETIREEE BENEFITS. THEY DIDN'T SAY EXECUTIVE RETIREEE BENEFITS.
Jon: BY THEM BUYING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES I'M ONLY ASSUMING THAT IS PROFIT THAT  GOES INTO AN INSURANCE COMPANY AS WELL. SO THEY'VE CREATED A SORT OF A SELF SUSTAINING SYSTEM FOR THEM.
NO IT'S LIKE A GIANT TAX SHELTER. WHEN THE EMPLOYEES OR THE EX-EMPLOYEES OR THE RETIREES DIE, THE DEATH BENEFIT IS TAX  FREE TO THE COMPANY.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT ALL THOSE CAKES AND PARTIES ARE AT CORPORATIONS. THEY ALWAYS SAY IT'S FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY BUT CHANCES ARE... (LAUGHING). THIS IS IS REMARKABLE. AGAIN IT'S VERY EASY TO GET INTO THIS IDEA THAT ALL CORPORATIONS YOU CAN DEMONIZE  EVERYTHING THEY DO. OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE DONE A GREAT SERVICE AND AN ENGINE FOR THE ECONOMY. BUT THIS HAS GOTTEN WAY OUT OF HAND.
IT'S... THEIR HANDS ARE IN EVERYTHING. VIRTUALLY EVERY RECOMMENDATION THAT COMPANIES MAKE TO IMPROVE RETIREMENT SECURITY  ESSENTIALLY HELPS IMPROVE THEIR BOTTOM LINE. IT DOESN'T IMPROVE ANYTHING FOR THE EMPLOYEE.
Jon: WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE PENSIONS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS NOT THE PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE WAY THAT THESE OTHER CORPORATIONS CAN MANIPULATE. TO BE FAIR TO THEM IF THE ECONOMY TANKS....
THE STOCK MARKET GOING DOWN, BUT YOU STARTED OUT WITH IF YOU WERE LIKE VERIZON AND YOU STARTED OUT WITH 24 MILLION  SURPLUS YOU KNOW THAT STOCK MARKETS GO DOWN AND INTEREST RATES CAN FALL AND YOU KNOW  THAT PEOPLE GET OLDER.
Jon: I HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT MONEY OUT TO BUY PHONE CASES. RETIREMENT HEIST. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. READ IT WITH A GLASS OF WINE. THANK YOU. ELLEN SCHULTZ.
