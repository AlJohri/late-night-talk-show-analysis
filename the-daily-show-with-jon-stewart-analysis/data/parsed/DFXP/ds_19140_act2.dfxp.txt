WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. NOW, AS YOU KNOW, AMERICA BELIEVES IN NAME BRANDS. YOU'VE GOT YOUR FORD, YOUR JOHNSON & JOHNSON, YOUR KARDASHIAN. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET. BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS? MICHAEL CHE HAS MORE.
AMERICA IS GRIPPED WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THESE DAYS, BUT THE ELECTION 2016 WILL OFFER A BIT OF SECURITY.
I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THE ELECTION 2016 IS YOU HAVE TWO BRANDS THAT YOU KNOW -- HILLARY CLINTON AND JEB BUSH.
THAT'S RIGHT, THE COKE AND PEPSI OF POLITICS ARE BACK.
IF IT'S A CLINTON BRAND, YOU'RE ALL GOOD TO GO, A BUSH BRAND, ALL GOOD TO GO.
SO OBAMA, HE'S LIKE A GENERIC BRAND ALMOST, LIKE AN OFF BRAND?
YEAH, HE WAS BRAND THAT WE HAD NOT HEARD OF BEFORE.
WHEN I WAS A KID, I REMEMBER MY DAD GOT ME A FOUR-STRIPE ADIDAS. I DON'T WANT A FOUR-STRIPE ADIDAS PRESIDENT.
I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE ON THAT.
EXACTLY. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SHOP FOR A PRESIDENT AT FAMILY DOLLAR? THANKFULLY 2016 WILL HAVE NAMES YOU CAN TRUST.
THIS IS EXCITING BECAUSE WE KNOW THE BRAND. WE AIN'T GOT READ THE BROCHURE. YOU FEEL ME?
YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE. YOU'RE JUST WAITING FOR THE SEQUEL TO COME OUT.
WE TRIED OUR BLACK GUY PHASE. IT'S OVER. NOW WE NEED TO GET BACK TO WHAT WORKS.
WHICH IS CLINTON OR BUSH.
I WAS GOING TO SAY WHITE DUDES.
WELL, OR WHITE WOMEN.
YET SOME, LIKE POLITICAL SCIENTIST JONATHAN ZIMMERMAN, REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL THE TIME THAT COULD BE SAVED BY GOING WITH THE NAME YOU KNOW.
WE DON'T NEED A BRAND NAME IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S A GIANT COUNTRY AND WE SHOULD BE CASTING THE WIDEST POSSIBLE NET IN TRYING TO FIND ABLE LEADERS FOR OURSELVES. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR NAME OR THEIR BLOOD LINE IS.
WOULD YOU VOTE FOR PHILIP HITLER? [LAUGHTER]
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY NAMED HITLER IS GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OR ANYTHING ELSE.
CAUSE THAT BRAND IS RUINED.
I WOULDN'T PERSONALLY CARE WHAT THE GUY'S NAME WAS.
YOU WOULDN'T CARE WHAT PHIL HITLER'S NAME WAS?
NO. BUT LOTS OVER PEOPLE WOULD, AND PHIL HITLER, OUR IMAGINARY PHIL HITLER WOULD KNOW THAT, SO HE WOULD RUN AS PHIL HOOVER OR...
WHAT ABOUT FRED BIN LADEN?
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD DO THAT.
YES, THE GREAT FAMILY NAMES OF THIS COUNTRY TELL US WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. SO WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER EAT, THIS DELICIOUS, SUCCULENT McDONALD'S BURGER, OR THIS BURGER MADE BY SOME DUDE WHO HAS BEEN CRAFTING BURGERS WITH ALL ORGANIC HANDMADE INGREDIENTS?
THE BURGER CRAFTED BY THE ORGANIC CRAFTSMAN DUDE, OF COURSE.
GIVE ME A COKE, SOME FRENCH FRIES, THAT McDONALD'S HAMBURGER, I'M DONE.
SADLY OTHER'S SHARE ZIMMERMAN'S DANGEROUS POINT OF VIEW.
IF WE CAN'T FIND MORE THAN TWO OR THREE FAMILIES TO RUN FOR HIGH OFFICE, THAT'S SILLY.
WHAT IF ZIMMERMAN AND BABS ARE RIGHT? MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T JUST DEPEND ON TWO OR THREE FAMILIES. THERE HAD TO BE SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE, BUT WHO?
I AM THE GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER OF OUR EIGHTH PRESIDENT, MARTIN VAN BUREN. [LAUGHTER]
I DON'T SEE IT. OH, WAIT. OH, YEAH, I SEE IT NOW. YOU GOT THE WHOLE THING. THAT MAKES SENSE. LILY VAN BUREN WAS PERFECT, AN OFFSPRING OF A PRESIDENT SO FORGETTABLE HE WOULDN'T OFFEND THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT. NOW, OBVIOUSLY THE VAN BUREN NAME IS SYNONYMOUS WITH... WHAT IS IT SYNONYMOUS WITH? I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
INTEGRITY.
OKAY.
INBRED LEADERSHIP QUALITIES.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM "INBRED," BUT GO ON.
OH YEAH, SO, MARTIN VAN BUREN HAD THE GIFT OF LEADERSHIP.
SHE HAD TO RUN. THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS TO TEST THIS NEW-OLD BRAND IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE THAT MATTERED MOST, POTENTIAL STAFFERS WHO'D WORK FOR FREE. I BRING TO YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, LILY VAN BUREN. [APPLAUSE]
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, ARE YOU BETTER OFF NOW THAN YOU WERE 126 YEARS AGO? I WILL FREE AMERICA FROM ITS DEPENDENCE ON BIG WHALE OIL. WE WILL STOP THE PERSIAN EMPIRE FROM GETTING THE GATLIN GUN. YES, WE VAN.
THAT'S RIGHT. YES WE VAN.
IT WAS A SUCCESS. LOOK OUT, JEB, HILLARY AND PHIL HITLER, THIS CLASSIC AMERICAN BRAND IS BACK.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NAME AND YOU HAVE THE NAME. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, LILY VAN BUREN.
WELL, ON MY DRIVER'S LICENSE, I'M MARY LEE WITMER.
WAIT. WHAT? WITMER.
WITMER. THAT'S MY MARRIED NAME.
WELL, CLOSE ENOUGH.
Jon: MICHAEL CHE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
