(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, SHE'S GOT A NEW FILM. IT'S CALLED "BLENDED."
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SWEATER, JUST FOR THE ARTICLES.
NO, THESE ARE ACTUALLY FOR MY SON.
WOW, WHAT A PROGRESSIVE MOTHER.
NO, I FOUND A CENTER FOLD UNDER HIS BED AND I TORE IT UP.
SO WHAT, YOU'RE HERE TO REPLACE IT BEFORE THE KID FINDS OUT?
YES, BUT I CAN'T TELL WHAT MAGAZINE IT'S FROM. I, I, I JUST --
DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THE CENTER FOLD REMNANTS?
YES, I DO. I AM -- I TRIED TO TAPE IT BACK UP.
DID A GREAT JOB. YOU CAN HARDLY TELL.
Jon: BEEN THERE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM DREW BARRYMORE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY SURREAL BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, I WATCH YOU AND COLBERT EVERY NIGHT. AND NOW I'M GOING TO BE ON IT.
Jon: IT'S A TREMENDOUS HOUR OF POWER, WE CALL IT.
IT IS A POWER HOUR!
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT POWER HOUR. SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU GAVE BIRTH, WHAT, FOUR WEEKS AGO?
MY DAUGHTER IS ONE MONTH OLD TODAY.
Jon: THAT'S CRAZY! CRAZY!
AND I AM LIKE ALWAYS NERDING OUT. I'M, LIKE, HAPPY BIRTHDAY -- AND MY HUSBAND'S, LIKE, IT'S NOT HER BIRTHDAY EXACTLY, BUT OKAY.
Jon: BUT THIS, YOU WENT TO AFRICA, DID YOU ACTUALLY GO TO AFRICA?
YEAH, FOR TWO MONTHS.
Jon: YOU TRAVELED TO AFRICA. DON'T YOU NEED LIKE DENGUE FEVER SHOTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT? DO THEY HAVE TO DO THAT TOO?
OH, LIKE EVERYTHING. YEAH, YOU HAVE TO PRETTY MUCH PREPARE FOR ANYTHING. THEN, YOU KNOW, LIKE A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE, I PRETTY MUCH, LIKE, CUT 20 YEARS OFF MY LIFE IN STRESS AND FEAR AND CORONARIES AND FREAKOUTS AND WHAT IFS AND NOT LIVING IN THE PRESENT BECAUSE I'M SO CERTAIN THE FUTURE IS JUST GOING TO BE DIABOLICAL, AND THEN IT WAS ALL OKAY.
Jon: OH!
AND IT WAS, LIKE, OKAY, THIS IS A GOOD LIFE LESSON THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A CORONARY ON A MINUTELY BASIS.
Jon: I THOUGHT THIS STORY WAS GOING TO END IN A XANEX PERSCRIPTION.
OH, THERE WAS ONE OF THOSE TOO. BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST ON BENADRYL.
Jon: THERE YOU GO. RESPECT. BENADRYL RESPECT. ALLERGIES ARE CRAZY. GOING TO AFRICA WITH YOUR OWN 6 MONTH OLD, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, BOY, THAT'S A RECIPE FOR ANOTHER MOVIE RIGHT THERE. LIKE, YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THE JUNGLE THEM RAISING YOUR CHILD. YOU CAN'T FIND HER, THEN YOUR CHILD IS RAISED BY HYENAS, THEN IT GETS ITS OWN DISNEY MOVIE. LIKE, IT'S A WHOLE, YOU COULD HAVE A WHOLE THING GOING.
YEAH, BUT I DID, I TOOK HER OUT EVERY WEEKEND TO SEE DIFFERENT ANIMALS AND I ALSO REALIZED THAT ALL OF MY STRESS WAS INEVITABLY LEADING TO LIKE THIS EXTRAORDINARY LIFE EXPERIENCE WHERE I'M STANDING, LIKE, WITH MY KID AND, LIKE, THERE'S 50 ELEPHANTS FANS ROLLING BY AND I'M, LIKE, WOW, I WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS OPTION WHEN I THOUGHT OF EVERY HARD, GNARLY THING THAT COULD OCCUR. THIS IS COOL.
Jon: HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU THIS, AND I WANT TO KNOW THIS FOR REAL, HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU STAND THERE AS THE ELEPHANTS WERE GOING BY AND HOLD THE CHILD UP LIKE THIS? AND GO -- (SINGING) DID YOU DO THAT A BUNCH?
I WAS MORE LIKE OH LET'S INSTAGRAM THIS TO OUR GIRLFRIENDS BACK HOME SO THEY CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE UP TO. ON OUR SIX CHAIN INSTAGRAM PROGRAM.
Jon: THAT'S NICE. THE THING I ALWAYS FIND TOO, LIKE, WITH A 6-MONTH-OLD, YOU THINK, LIKE LOOK ELEPHANTS. AND MEANWHILE THEY'RE JUST, LIKE, LOOK, FABRIC! LIKE, THEY DON'T --
IT WAS ACTUALLY FUNNY. WE WERE LATE TO WORK ONE TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS A HERD OF ELEPHANTS BLOCKING THE ROAD.
Jon: SURE. RIGHT.
NO, BUT IT'S SO,  THE DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK! I WAS, LIKE, NO, REALLY WHAT WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? INFURIATE THEM? WE WERE WAY OUTNUMBERED IN OUR SMALL CAR! THERE'S TEN ELEPHANTS. LIKE, I'M GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THEY PASS!
Jon: SURE, NO, YOU WAIT. WHERE WERE THEY GOING, DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT ONE CAR DID TRY TO GET BY THEM AND THEY WERE NOT HAVING THAT.
Jon: I'M SURE THE ELEPHANTS WERE LIKE, OH, (BLEEP), WE'RE LATE FOR WORK! (LAUGHTER)
THEY WERE.
Jon: BUT YOU, YOUR MOVIE, A LOT OF HEART, YOU'RE TELLING ME IT HAS A LOT OF HEART, IT'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE CRY.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF AFRICA, AND THERE'S GREAT COMEDY AND IT'S A VERY BIG FUN, SCOPEY, HAPPY MOVIE, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS A GREAT EMOTIONAL JOURNEY. IT IS A GREAT ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT ADAM AND I GOT TO DO TOGETHER. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU'RE, LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I LOVE HIM! JELL-O SHOTS! AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OLDER, YOU'RE LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, IS HE GOING TO PICK THE KIDS UP ON TIME? AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO REACH HIM? IS HE GOING TO BE A GOOD FATHER? AND IT'S THIS ROMANCE SET IN A WORLD WHERE THESE TWO PEOPLE BECOME ATTRACTED TO EACH OTHER BASED ON EACH OTHER'S PARENTING STYLES. AND, I THOUGHT, I LOVE THAT. THAT'S TOTALLY WHERE I AM IN MY LIFE. THAT'S MY PRIORITY AND I LOVED IT AND IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT WHAT KIDS NEED, AND ARE THE KIDS HAPPY AND THERE'S JUST, YOU KNOW, AMONGST ALL THE CRAZINESS, IT'S LIKE --
Jon: LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE ALRIGHT, KID.
-- PARENTING. THIS IS LOVELY. DREW BARRYMORE, THANK YOU FOR COMING BY ALWAYS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BLENDED WILL BE IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY. IT'S DREW BARRYMORE!
