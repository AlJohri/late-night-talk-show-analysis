AS WE ALL NOW KNOW, JUST YESTERDAY DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED AT THE NBC FALL SCHEDULE  UNVEILING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SEEKING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. HIS ANNOUNCEMENTS FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT AMANDA PEET WILL BE GOING TO SERIES. BOTH IMPORTANT. LUCKILY TRUMP DID NOT ALLOW THE OBJECTIVE REALITY OF HIS FAILED PRESIDENTIAL RUN TO DAMPEN HIS  IMAGINARY PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY.
THIS DECISION DOES NOT COME EASILY WITHOUT REGRET, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY POTENTIAL CANDIDACY CONTINUES TO BE VALIDATED BY THE RANKING AT THE  TOP OF THE REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS IN POLLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I MAINTAIN THE STRONG CONVICTION THAT IF I WERE TO RUN, I WOULD BE ABLE TO WIN THE PRIMARY. I LOVE THIS GUY. AND ULTIMATELY THE GENERAL ELECTION.
Jon: I VERY EASILY COULD HAVE BECOME THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, RESTORED AMERICA'S  STATUS ABROAD AND SUCH AND SUCH, BUT I REALIZED I CAN DO FOR MORE GOOD AND MANKIND BUILDING UPSCALE GOLF COURSES AND  CONDOMINIUMS IN THE GREATER TRI-STATE AREA AS WELL AS KEEPING MEATLOAF ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW. MR. TRUMP, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK YOU LEFT THE RACE TOO SOON. YOU RAISED SO MANY QUESTIONS, LIKE WHAT DID YOUR CRACK TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS FIND IN HAWAII?
I HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN STUDYING IT, AND THEY CANNOT  BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE FINDING.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE DOWN THERE IN HAWAII SEARCHING?
ABSOLUTELY. THEY CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY'RE FINDING.
Jon: YOU NEVER TOLD US. [LAUGHTER] WILL WE BELIEVE IT? WAS IT AN AMULET? A CURSED AM YOU LET THAT MAKES THE WEARER BELIEVE HE HAS INFORMATION THAT DOESN'T  ACTUALLY EXIST? [LAUGHTER] IT'S NOT JUST THE COUNTRY THAT YOU'RE LETTING DOWN, IT'S YOU. YOU'RE LETTING DONALD TRUMP DOWN. YOU KNOW, A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR SHE WOULD RATHER WALK AWAY FROM HER  SUPPORT ROLE AS THEY TRIED TO CREATE A SAY DOG SHAMPOOING BUSINESS THAT SHE WOULD RATHER  WALK AWAY THAN CONTINUE TO WATTLE THE TERRIBLE PERSON THAT IS STAR JONES.
YOU SHOULDN'T QUIT. IF YOU QUIT, IT'S GOING TO FOLLOW YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
THEY'RE SAYING TO WALK AWAY.
YOU WENT THIS FAR. FOR YOU TO QUIT IS STUPID.
YOU'RE FIRED AND YOU'RE A QUITTER AND STAR JONES KICKED  YOUR ASS WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WELL, DONALD, IT APPEARS THE NANNY LEAKER HAS BECOME THE NANNY LEAKY. YOU QUIT. YOU HAD US ALL CONVINCED YOU WOULD TAKE OIL FROM LIBYA AND IRAQ AND MAKE THE CHINESE SUCK  YOUR GIANT GOLD BALLS. TURNS OUT YOU JUST HAVE ALUMINUM FOIL PAINTED GOLD BALLS. PROBABLY CHOCOLATE INSIDE. HIGH QUALITY CHOCOLATE. THEY'RE MORE LIKE FERRER0 ROCCHER BALLS WITH A LITTLE HAZELNUT. DON'T QUIT. LOOK, DONALD, WE WENT IN WAY OVER OUR HEADS BANKING ON YOUR RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WE SPENT $450 MILLION WE DON'T HAVE BUILD "THE DAILY  ANTHENAEUM" SHE'S DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL JOKE HEADQUARTERS. WE WERE JUST A WEEK AWAY FROM COMPLETING THE PROJECT WITH ITS FINAL TOUCHES. THAT'S REALITY BETTEN GOLDEN ALPACA FUR. WE HAD A WHOLE TEAM SWEEP IT UP LIKE THAT. I WAITED MY WHOLE LIFE FAR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LIKE YOU, A MIX OF ARROGANCE WITH LACK OF FILTER AND EASILY EXPLOITABLE PHYSICAL TRAITS. SERIOUSLY. LOOK AT YOU. YOU LOOK LIKE THE OFFSPRING OF IF LOU DOBBS AND JIM CRAMER  [BLEEPED] A MUPPET. [LAUGHTER] NO ONE WANTED YOU TO BE PRESIDENT. WE JUST WANTED TO WATCH YOU RUN. BUT IF YOU WON'T LISTEN TO ME, PERHAPS YOU'LL LISTEN TO THIS LITTLE BOY I FOUND BREATHING STEAM IN FRONT OF THE DINER EACH  MORNING WHERE I BREAKFAST. "PLEASE, SIR, PLEASE, CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE." I'M SORRY, LITTLE BOY, IT'S OVER.
IT CAN'T BE OVER, JON, BECAUSE I PURCHASED SOME THINGS ALREADY WITH THE TRUMP JOKE BONUS MONEY THAT YOU PROMISED ME.
Jon: JOHN, I TOLD YOU NOT TO GET ANYTHING.
I JUST MADE SOME REAL ESTATE PURCHASES, JON, RELAX. I USED AFTER LAST DOLLAR OF THE CROTCH MONSTER 5,000, MY NEW JET SKI, JON.
Jon: WHO IS THAT GIRL ON THE BACK OF YOUR JET SKI?
I DON'T KNOW. SHE CAME WITH THE JET SKI. THE POINT, IS I'M BROKE, JON. I EVEN HAD TO SELL THE FINGERS ON MY GLOVES.
Jon: PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, OLIVER.
I'M SORRY.
Jon: GOD DAMMIT, TRUMP, LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING. RUN, FOR GOD'S SAKE, RUN. AMERICA NEEDS YOU.
RUN, PLEASE, PLEASE.
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBO
