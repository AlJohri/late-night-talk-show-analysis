MARCH 15th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, TONIGHT'S PROGRAM, MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS, NO ONE. (LAUGHTER) WE DO NOT HAVE A GUEST TONIGHT. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO, I'M JUST GOING SIT FOR FIVE, SIX MINUTES AND JUST STARE. (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE A GUEST TONIGHT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A BLOCKBUSTER TWO-PART  INVESTIGATION BY OUR OWN JOHN OLVER THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON AT THE END OF HIS EXPOSE HE WE ARE GIVING AWAY A VAN. CHAERS PLAUS THAT DOES NOT LONG TO US. (LAUGHTER) SO THE WINNER WILL RECEIVE A STOLEN VAN. (LAUGHTER) I HAVE 20 MINUTES TO STEAL A VAN. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, NO VAN. BUT FIRST, I AM SICK OF THE ELECTIONS. I WANT TO START WITH A STORY OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE.
SYRIAN DICTATOR ASSAD HIS PERSONAL E-MAILS WERE LEAKED TO THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER GUARDIANCE.
BRITIAN FWAURDIAN NEWSPAPER SAID IT OBTAINED THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS TO AND  FROM PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD.
Jon: FINALLY, AN E-MAIL HACK OF SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DESERVES TO HAVE THEIR E-MAIL HACKED. THANK GOD. (APPLAUSE) ENOUGH WITH THE HACKING OF THE-- I DON'T REMEMBER LARRY  KING BEING A VICTIM OF THAT. THAT-- OH, RIGHT, I REMEMBER THAT. I REMEMBER THAT. (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS-- I IMAGINE THE MASS RESPONSE TO ANYBODY WATCHING THE SHOW NOW IS  LIKE EVERYBODY TAKING THE CINNAMON CHALLENGE AT ONCE. AH! AH! ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU. BASHAR AL-ASSAD. THE SYRIAN DICTATOR CURRENTLY 12 MONTHS INTO A MASSACRE OF HIS OWN CITIZENS. IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE REVEALED HIS SECRETARY RED TACTICS AND WEAKNESSES.
MORE THAN 3,000 E-MAILS REVEAL THAT THE SYRIAN STRONGMAN IS HOOKED ON iTUNES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THIS GUY MASSACRES HIS OWN PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY BUT MAKES SURE HE PURCHASES  HIS MUSIC LEGALLY? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'LL TAUNT NATO AND THE WORLD COMMUNITY BUT EVEN  I WON'T [BLEEP] WITH APPLE.
ASSAD DOWNLOADED VIDEO IMGAS, MOVIES, APPS AND TUNES BY LMFAO, CHRIS BROWN  AND EVEN COUNTRY STAR BLAKE SHELTON.
Jon: WOW. HE DOWNLOADS CHRIS BROWN. I HOPE THE ASSOCIATION WITH AN UNAPOLOGETICALLY VIOLENT BRUTE DOESN'T HURT ASSAD'S REPUTATION. (LAUGHTER) WHAT ELSE YOU GOT ON THIS GUY?
WE HAVE SOME OF THE SNIPPETS FROM THESE REVEALING E-MAILS. ASSAD'S WIFE WRITES IN LATE NOVEMBER, ARE YOU COMING AROUND THE SECOND OR BEFORE. IF SO, PLEASE CAN YOU BRING THE HARRY POTTER DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2 RELEASED ON  THE SECOND OF DECEMBER.
Jon: SO ASSAD WANTED HARRY POTTER MOVIES OR AS HE PROBABLY REFERS TO THEM, THE  VOLDEMORT CHRONICLES AND HIS STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME THE BOY WITHOUT CAN'T BE NAMED. I GOT TO TELL YOU, IF DICTATORS ARE GOING TO USE E-MAIL IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS. HEY, YOU, COME OVER. I'M GRILLING SOME CHICKEN, LOL, DAMN YOU AUTO CORRECT. KILLING SOME CITIZENS. ROTFL, REALLY OPPRESSING FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH, WE STRUGGLED TO FIGURE OUT AN EMOTICON THAT A DICTATOR WOULD USE. I AM GLAD THE INTERNET WASN'T INVENTED IN HITLER'S TIME. I IMAGINE EVA BRAUN SAYING GET IN HERE, I FOUND A SITE WHERE THE KITTENS ALL LOOK JUST LIKE YOU. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. I AM ABOUT TO DO THE WORST SEGUE IN THE HISTORY OF THE SHOW. SPEAKING OF CREATURES THAT AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT JEWS OR WATER--  (LAUGHTER)  WE REWRITE THE SHOW RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW. SO SOMETIMES WE SCREW UP. HERE'S A LITTLE STORY FROM A SMALL TOWN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE TOWN OF MOUNT VERNON NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTES TO CHANGE THE CONTROVERSIAL NAME OF A POND. FOR DECADES IT'S BEEN NAMED JEW POND.
JEW POND.
THIS IS JEW POND.
Jon: AH, YES.
I I SOMEONE IS CATCHING TADPOLES ON JEW POND. JUST ME, SAL, IRVING, MORTGAGEY AND WHO COULD FORGETTESTER. JEW POND, IT'S NOT STINGY WITH THE MEMORIES, I'LL TELL YOU THAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT THEY SAY JEW POND HAS A DARK SIDE. LEGEND HAS IT THE POND'S INHABITED BY STRANGE AND SOMEWHAT NEUROTIC MYTHICAL CREATURE. (LAUGHTER) I WOULDN'T WANT TO SWIM IN ANY POND THAT WOULD HAVE ME THIS MONSTER. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT I ACTUALLY, I DON'T WANT TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. MAYBE JEW POND-- MAYBE JEW POND ISN'T REALLY NAMED OFFENSIVELY. MAYBE IT'S JUST A SHORTENED VERSION OF THE NAME OF AN INDIAN TRIBE KNOWN FOR ITS ANTI-SEMITISM. OR MAYBE THERE'S AN INNOCENT EXPLANATION.
IT GOT ITS NAME BACK IN THE '20s AFTER TWO JEWISHMEN BOUGHT A NEARBY HOTEL AND  THE POND THAT CAME ALONG WITH IT KNOWN AT THE TIME OF SPRINGTIME.
DURING THAT PERIOD, SOMEONE IN TOWN APPARENTLY COINED THE PHRASE JEW POND.
Jon: OKAY THEN. SO IT WAS NAMED BECAUSE IT WAS BOUGHT BY A COUPLE OF JEWS. BUT AT LEAST THE TOWNS FOLK ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT'S KIND OF OFFENSIVE.
IT'S NOT OFFENSIVE TO ME.
I REALLY DON'T FIND IT OFFENSIVE AT ALL.
DOESN'T OFFEND ME.
WHY CHANGE SOMETHING, BEEN THAT WAY FOREVER.
Jon: WELL, NOT FOREVER. JUST SINCE TWO JEWS BOUGHT IT. THEN TUESDAY NIGHT MOUNT VERNON VOTERS WANT TO THE POLL.
THE TOWNS PEOPLE CAST THEIR VOTE BY SECRET BALLOT. THE RESULT, 104 TO 33 IN FAVOR OF A NAME CHANGE.
AS OF RIGHT NOW THE TOWN HAS NOT AGREED ON A NEW NAME YET.
Jon: OH, BUT THEY DO HAVE SEVERAL WORKING PROPOSALS INCLUDING KIKE'S CREEK. (LAUGHTER) MEL'S BROOK. AND INTERNATIONAL BANKING CONSPIRACY LAGOON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
