FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY  SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. WHOA, WE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU,  JOINING US FROM THE NEW YORK  KNICKER BOCKERS BASKETBALL  CLUB MR. AMARE STOUDEMIRE WILL BE JOINING US. WE WILL TRADE NOTES ON HOW  EACH OF US CELEBRATED YOM  KIPPUR. NOW, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE  HEARD ABOUT THE TENSIONS IN  SYRIA, IRAN, THROUGHOUT THE  MIDEAST. BUT THERE IS A BATTLE  BREWING MUCH CLOSER TO HOME.
TONIGHT THE FOOD FIGHT  SWEEPING SCHOOL CAFETERIAS  NATIONWIDE.
STUDENTS WHO SAY HEALTHY  LUNCHES NOW MANDATED UNDER  FEDERAL GUIDELINES ARE  LEAVING THEM HUNGRY.
Jon: NEWS FLASH! EXTRA EXTRA, CHILDREN THINK  SCHOOL LUNCHES SUCK. (LAUGHTER)  WE NOW GO OUT TO OUR OWN  CAPTAIN OBVIOUS WHO HAS BEEN  FOLLOWING THIS STORY SINCE  SCHOOLS BEGAN SERVING LUNCH. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE  PROBLEM?
SMALLER PORTIONS, FEWER  CALORIES, LESS MEAT AND  CHEESE, AND MORE FRUITS AND  VEGETABLES.
SOME KIDS ARE COMPLAINING  THAT THEIR LUNCH DOESN'T  FILL THEM UP.
THE NEW RULES LIMIT  ELEMENTARY SCHOOLERS TO  650-- 650 CALL REERX 700  CALORIES FOR MIDDLE  SCHOOLERS AND 850 FOR HIGH  SCHOOLERS.
Jon: EXTRA EXTRA, SCHOOL  LUNCHES SUCK! AND THE PORTIONS ARE TOO  SMALL. (LAUGHTER)  SO YOU HATE THE FOOD AND YOU  WANT MORE OF IT. BUT I GUESS LOOK F THE  GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY  POLICING STUDENTS AND  RESES-- RESTRICTING THEIR  CALORIC INTAKE THAT DOES SEEM A BIT DRACONIAN.
DESPITE CALORIE LIMITS  STUDENTS CAN ALWAYS GET  SECONDS OF FRUITS AND  VEGETABLES.
Jon: OH, SURE, FRUITS AND  VEGETABLES, LIKE THAT COUNTS  AS FOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL FRUITS  AND VEGETABLES AT MY SCHOOL,  NERD GRENADES. AND I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I  GOT HIT BY A LOT OF NERD  GRENADES. (LAUGHTER)  I THOUGHT MY NICK NAME WAS  INCOMING. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT, SURE. THIS IS ONLY FOR LUNCHES  THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED BY THE  GOVERNMENT AND SURE, YOU'RE  ALLOW UNLIMB THED FRUITS AND  VEGETABLES. BUT A THIRD OF OUR KIDS ARE  OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. AND IF THIS KEEPS UP FROM  THE GOVERNMENT WE ARE NEVER  GETTING THAT ABOVE 50%. (LAUGHTER)  I'M STILL NOT CLEAR ON WHY  THEY'RE HUNGRY.
AT SOME SCHOOLS THE  AMOUNT OF FOOD THROWN OUT IN  CAFETERIAS IS SHOCKING.
KIDS ARE NOW THROWING  AWAY TWICE AS MUCH FOOD AS  LAST YEAR.
Jon: HMMMM, NOW I AM  OBVIOUSLY NOT A NUTRITIONIST  OR AN EDUCATOR BUT I THINK  IF THESE KIDS ARE HUNGRY I GUESS MY SOLUTION WOULD BE,  EAT YOUR MOTHER [BLEEP] LUNCH! (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW WHOSE'S NOT HUNGRY  IN YOUR OLD PAL REMMY  COUNTING OUT IN THE DUMPSTER. BECAUSE YOU GAVE HIM YOUR  LUNCH. SO THE USDA WHICH HAS BEEN  SETTING GUIDELINES FOR  SUBSIDIZED SCHOOL LUNCH  FORCE THE PAST, OH, I DON'T KNOW, 70 YEARS, HAS, I'M  TRYING TO CURB WHAT  EVERYBODY AGREE SAYS  CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROBLEM  CHANGED THE LAST YEAR'S SCHOOL LUNCH MEN FRU CHEESE  PIZZA, CANNED PIE NAP  APP-- IAN APPLE, TATER TOTS  INTO WHOLE WHEAT CHEEZ PIZZAR, APPLESAUCE AND LOW  FAT MILK. OOOH. WHY IS THIS NEWS?
NEW GUIDELINES THANKS TO  MICHELLE OBAMA, MICHELLE  OBAMA SCHOOL LUNCH CALORIE  LIMITS.
MICHELLE OBAMA NUTRITIONAL  SCHOOL LUNCHES.
Jon: OH, MAN, OH, RIGHT,  THAT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T REALLY  ABOUT FOOD OR KIDS. IT'S ABOUT BIG GOVERNMENT  UBER THANNY MICHELLE OBAMA  WHO IF SHE SAID WE FEED  CLEAN AIR HALF THE COUNTRY WOULD DEMAND GILLS BECAUSE  FREEDOM! LISTEN THE COMPLAINT.
THE USDA SHOULDN'T BE  DECIDING HOW MANY CALORIES  WE TAKE OR HOW MANY CALORIES  WE EXPEND DURING THE DAY. AT SOME POINT IT PERSONAL  RESPONSIBILITY, I'M TALKING  ABOUT.
Jon: THIS IS AMERICA,  JACK. JUST BECAUSE UNCLE SAM IS  BUYING ME LUNCH DOESN'T MEAN  HE REQUEST TELL ME WHAT TO  EAT-- HE CAN TELL ME WHAT TO  EAT. BY THE WAY, HOW DO YOU FEEL  ABOUT THIS.
THE ISSUE SHOULD YOU BE  ABLE TO USE, BE ALLOWED TO  USE AN ABD CARD I FOOD STAMP  CARD AT A McDONALD'S.
I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY  TAX DOLLAR GOING A FAMILY  BUYING STUFF AT COSTCO AND  BULK.
Jon: RIGHT, BECAUSE THIS  IS AMERICA, JACK! IF UNCLE SAM IS PAYING FOR  THE MEAL, UNCLE SAM GETS TO  TELL WHERE YOU TO EAT. OH! I JUST FORGOT, I DON'T MAKE  ANY [BLEEP] SENSE! THE STORY ACTUALLY CAME TO  LIGHT BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF  A FINI PARODY MUSIC VIDEO  MADE BY SOME HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT EVEN INCLUDED  SOME MUCH YOUNGER STUDENTS  SINGING ALONG IN KANSAS  WHERE THEY DECRIED THE NEW FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND EVEN  BURNED THE LEGISLATION. KIDS TAKING A STRONG  POLITICAL STAND. PRETTY SOPHISTICATED STUFF.
THE PARODY SCHOOL WAS  ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY AN  ENGLISH TEACHER AT THE  SCHOOL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH, A TEACHER WROTE  A SONG THAT THE CHILDREN  INCLUDING WHAT APPEAR TO BE  ELEMENTARY SCHOOLKIDS PERFORMED AGAINST THE  GOVERNMENT. I WONDER HOW FOX IS GOING TO  TAKE THIS. I DON'T MEAN THEIR PUNDITS,  I MEAN THEIR NEWS PEOPLE.
CAFETERIA REVOLT, THE NEW  SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM THAT  HAS LEFT STUDENTS STARVING.
IN KANSAS SOME KIDS AND A  TEACHER CAME UP WITH A  PARODY, A VIDEO TURNING THE  SONG WE ARE YOUNG INTO WE ARE HUNGRY.
I'M TOLD THAT IF PEOPLE  DON'T LIKE THEIR VEGETABLES  YOU JUST SERVE IT TO THEM  DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AND SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT  THAT WILL MAKE THEM LOVE  THEIR VEGETABLES.
Jon: IT'S ALL JUST GOOD  FUN THIS IS A FUNNY LITTLE  VIDEO, PARODY INDIVIDUAL YOG,  KIDS AT SCHOOL T REMINDED ME OF THAT VIDEO OF KIDS  SINGING A SONG ABOUT BARACK  OBAMA JUST AFTER HE WAS  INAUGURATED.
WE ARE TRYING TO GET SOME  ANSWERS ABOUT A VIDEO THAT  IS GETTING ATTENTION ON THE  DRUDGE REPORT WEB SITE THIS  MORNING. IT SHOWS YOUNG CHILDREN  SINGING THE PRAISES, QUITE  LITERALLY OF THE PRESIDENT. MANY PARENTS HAVE NO PROBLEM  WITH THIS. MANY PARENT WAS. AND JUST DON'T WANT THIS  SORT OF POLITICAL  CHEERLEADING, IF YOU WILL,  IN THE CLASSROOM.
Jon: HMMMM, THE TONE  SEEMS DIFFERENT IN THOSE TWO  STORIES. SO KIDS SINGING A SONG  CRITICIZING THE  ADMINISTRATION, IT IS JUST  FUNNY. KIDS SINGING A SONG PRAISING  THE ADMINISTRATION, WE'LL  SHOW IT TO YOU. ITS'S-- IT'S VERY  DISTURBING. SO HOW DIVIDE READY WE AS A  NATION. WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF  DIABETES AND IF OBAMA IS  AGAINST THEM, WELL,  AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE NEWS  NETWORK IS FOR ONE OF THEM. (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
