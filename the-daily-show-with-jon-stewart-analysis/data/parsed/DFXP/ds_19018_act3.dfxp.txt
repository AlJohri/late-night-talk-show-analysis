HIS NEW SHOW FOR AMAZON  IS CALLED ALPHA HOUSE.
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.
HOW HAS IT CHANGED.
HE HAD ANOTHER STROKE LAST NIGHT. HE WITHDREW FROM THE RACE.
THAT'S GOOD. NOT FOR HIM OBVIOUSLY. [BLEEP] THAT'S AN OUTSTANDING DEVELOPMENT. WRONG HONEYBEAR. GUESS WHO JUST ANNOUNCED HE'S RUNNING? YOU CAN'T JUST SIT IN YOUR LITTLE MAN CAVE ANYMORE. WAITING TO GET RE-ELECTED.
Jon:  JOHN GOODMAN. [CROWD CHEERING] JOHN GOODMAN. [CROWD CHEERING] JOHN GOODMAN.
AM I HERE TO BE BARKED AT?
Jon:  NOT AT ALL.
ACTUALLY THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO SEE ARSENIO TONIGHT.
Jon:  MAY I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS TO YOU ANYWAY AND THIS MAY BE EMBARRASSING. YOU NEVER SUCK IN ANYTHING. I HAVE NEVER, I HAVE NEVER EVER. BRYAN CRANSTON IS LIKE THAT -- EVERYTHING YOU DO, IT'S AWESOME. AND I ALWAYS LOVE WATCHING YOU DO. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'VE DONE WHERE YOU GO BOY I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.
OH YEAH.
Jon:  REALLY.
YEAH.
Jon:  ARE YOU CRITICAL OF YOURSELF.
ALL THE TIME. IT GIVES ME THE CREEPS TO WATCH MYSELF. WE'RE DOING THIS SHOW ALPHA HOUSE AND THERE'S A BIG BUS AND THEY HAVE A TEN FOOT PICTURE OF MY FACE ON IT. WHICH IS JUST... IT MADE ME WANT TO GO BACK TO SATAN WORSHIPPING.
Jon:  IT'S NOT JUST THE FACE BUT THE CHARACTERS YOU'VE PLAYED AND IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING. THAT'S WHY THE COEN BROTHERS USE YOU IN EVERYTHING THEY DO. BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO BE IN EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO,  NATURALLY AND ORGANICALLY.
THEIR WRITING'S ALMOST FULL PROOF AND I'M LIVING PROOF OF THAT.
Jon:  HOW DOES THIS AMAZON THING, I DIDN'T KNOW AMAZON DID TELEVISION SHOWS. IS THAT A BUTTON YOU CLICK ON THE SITE? IS THAT HOW IT HAPPENS? [LAUGHTER]
I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST A COG IN THEIR MACHINE OF WORLD DOMINATION. AS LONG AS THEY OUTPOINT WALMART I'M COOL. THERE'S A GIZMO YOU BUY WITH AMAZON AND YOU GET FREE TV.
Jon:  IT RUNS ONLY ON AMAZON.
YES, AS FAR AS I KNOW. [LAUGHTER] IF IT'S ON REAL TV WE HAVE TO BLEEP ALL THE [BLEEP] OUT. IT'S THE ONLY PLEASURE DOING TELEVISION THESE DAYS.
Jon:  HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW IF IT'S REAL OR NOT. DO THEY PAY YOU IN AMAZON POINTS.
WHO DOESN'T GET PAID IN AMAZON POINTS.
Jon:  HOW DID THEY, WHO WAS THE CREATOR OF THIS PROGRAM.
GARRY TRUDEAU, THE CREATOR OF DOONESBURY.
Jon:  THAT'S WONDERFUL.
HE WRITES THESE INCREDIBLE SCRIPTS. VERY FUNNY. AND JONATHAN ALTAR. HE'S A PRODUCER AND GOT THE POLITICAL ANGLE ON EVERYTHING. HE'S GREAT TO HAVE AROUND.
THAT'S AWESOME. TRUDEAU IS ONE OF MY HEROES, GROWING UP AND READING DOONESBURY. MARVELING AT THE WAY HE WOULD TAKE THESE THINGS ALL THE WAY THROUGH WITH THE QUARTERBACK
DISABLED VETERANS.
Jon:  YES.
INCREDIBLE.
Jon:  IS HE ON THE SET --
CROSSING T'S AND DOTTING I'S. "WELL YOU LEFT AND 'AND' OUT OF THAT SENTENCE, JOHN. HEY YOU WENT TO YALE.
Jon: UNDERSTANDING THAT YALE IS A PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTION LET ME JUST SAY THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPENED THERE THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOUR SELF. LET ME JUST TELL YOU BRIEFLY IF I MAY, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. THERE ARE FIVE KIDS FROM YALE. SO BEFORE THE SHOW. I COME OUT AND THERE HE IS, NICE TO SEE YOU, SAGITARIOUS, NEXT QUESTION THAT KIND OF THING. WE'RE FROM YALE, WE HAVE A QUESTION. I IMMEDIATELY THINK, SIR, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. HERE'S HIS QUESTION. SOMEONE ON CAMPUS THAT'S BEEN URINATING IN DRYERS. AND RECENTLY THEY'VE TAKEN UP TO DEFECATING IN DRYERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO ABOUT THAT. [LAUGHTER]
ASK JON STEWART
Jon:  EXACTLY. [APPLAUSE]
Jon:  I DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY GOT ON THEIR SAT'S BUT ANYBODY CAN [BLEEP] A DRYER. IF THAT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GO TO YALE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T  GRADUATE FROM THERE.
I'VE DONE WORSE THAN THAT. I WENT TO A STATE SCHOOL.
Jon:  JOHN GOODMAN, ALPHA HOUSE PREMIERES ON AMAZON DOT COM ON NOVEMBER 15, WATCH THE FIRST THREE EPISODES FOR FREE AND THEN YOU END UP ORDERING A POWER WASHER FOR NO REASON.
BUT THEY'RE DAMN GOOD POWER WASHERS.
Jon:  JOHN GOODMAN.
