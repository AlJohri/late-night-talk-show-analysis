Jon:  WELECOME BACK. WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS, LEWIS BLACK CATCHES IT IN A SEGMENT WE CALL BACK IN BLACK. â™ª
NEXT WEEK IS MY FAVORITE DAY OF THE YEAR. BLACK FRIDAY. TRAMPLE A GUY ON A TUESDAY AFTERNOON YOU GET CHARGED WITH ASSAULT BUT DO IT AT A WAL-MART ON A BLACK FRIDAY YOU GET A PS4. BUT THIS YEAR, SOMETHING ABOUT BLACK FRIDAY IS TWISTING EVERYONE'S PANTIES.
BLACK FRIDAY ITSELF IS TURNING INTO AN ENTIRE SEASON.
DO I HOPE BLACK FRIDAY ENDS? ABSOLUTELY. I CAN'T STAND THAT DAY.
THE EVENT IS BECOMING SO LONG.
STARTING BLACK FRIDAY ON THANKSGIVING SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.
BLACK WEDNESDAY.
GRAY THURSDAY.
SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY.
CYBER MONDAY IS THE WORST THING I EVER HEARD.
WE MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT BLACK NOVEMBER.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT? OH NO, NOW BLENDERS ON SALE FOR A WHOLE MONTH! GOD, WHY HAVE THOU FORSAKEN US? NOBODY'S FORCING YOU TO BUY ANYTHING. YOU CAN SHOP, YOU CAN NOT SHOP. YOU CAN DO WHAT WE JEWS DO AND WAIT UNTIL THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS WHEN THEY'RE PRACTICALLY GIVING [BLEEP] AWAY. BUT THERE IS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE COMPLAINING.
WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS AT THESE STORES?
YEAH, WHEN EXACTLY DO THEY GET TO CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING WITH THEIR FAMILIES?
WORKERS ARE UPSET.
FORCED TO WORK.
THEY KEEP SAYING THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR ASSOCIATES. THAT'S NOT THE CASE.
THE DAUGHTER OF A K MART EMPLOYEE ASKING K MART TO CHANGE THEIR THANKSGIVING HOURS SO HER MOM CAN SPEND THE DAY AT HOME WITH HER FAMILY.
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO WORK THANKSGIVING.
WELL PERSONALLY, I'D MUCH RATHER SPEND THANKSGIVING AT K MART HELPING THE FAT GUY SHOVE HIS WAY INTO A PAIR OF CROCS BEATS LISTENING TO MY NEPHEW EXPLAIN AGAIN HOW HE'S ALLERGIC TO BEETS. NO YOU'RE NOT, MATTHEW. YOU JUST DON'T LIKE THEM. NOBODY DOES. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO [BLEEP] EAT THEM. BUT IF THIS LADY WANTS TO SPEND THANKSGIVING WITH HER FAMILY, WHO CAN BLAME HER? TURNS OUT EVERYBODY.
THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY THAT THEY HAVE A JOB TO WORK AT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH A LITTLE CAPITALISM?
IF KMART WANTS TO OPEN UP ON THANKSGIVING, LET THEM OPEN UP ON THANKSGIVING.
RICHARD WRITES TO US, HE SAYS YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME LADY. JUST GO TO WORK. YOU CAN CELEBRATE BY EATING A TURKEY SANDWICH WHILE ON BREAK. SURE. THANKSGIVING IS JUST AS GOOD EATING A COLD SANDWICH ALONE IN THE BACK OF A K MART. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED CRANBERRY SAUCE, YOU CAN SEASON IT WITH YOUR TEARS. BUT THIS YEAR IT'S NOT JUST EMPLOYEES GETTING SCREWED INTO WORKING ON THANKSGIVING, IT'S THE STORES TOO.
STORES AT THE WALDEN GALLERIA HAVE A TOUGH CHOICE THIS YEAR. OPEN ON THANKSGIVING OR POSSIBLY PAY A LOT OF MONEY IN FINES AND PENALTIES.
YOU'RE TAXING STORES FOR OBSERVING THANKGIVING. THAT'S THE MOST ANTI-AMERICAN THING I EVER HEARD. IT'S LIKE SHARIA LAW FOR CAPITALISM. WHY DON'T YOU JUST KICK GEORGE WASHINGTON IN THE NUTS> BUT IF NO ONE CARES WHEN STORES FORCE EMPLOYEES TO WORK ON THANKSGIVING, WHO IS GOING TO SHED A TEAR WHEN MALLS FORCE STORES TO STAY OPEN.
THE MALL IN UPSTATE NEW YORK IS STRONG ARMING ITS RETAILERS INTO OPENING ON THANKSGIVING. SO MUCH FOR THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT.
SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU CAN'T MAKE A STORE OPEN ON THANKSGIVING. IT'S JUST A POOR HELPLESS CORPORATION. BUT PEOPLE? PUNCH IN AND SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP. YOU CAN SEE YOUR FAMILY IN JANUARY. JON.
Jon:  THANK YOU, LEWIS. LEWIS BLACK.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
