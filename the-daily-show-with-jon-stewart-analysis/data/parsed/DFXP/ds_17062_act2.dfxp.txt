( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DISPLON WELCOME BACK.
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. IT IS FEBRUARY. WHEN A YOUNG MAN'S FANCY LIGHTLY TURNS TO THE TRILLIONS OF GERMS  THAT SURROUND HIM EVERY MOMENT. TIME FOR OUR LATEST INSTALLMENT OF "HYPOCHONDRIAC UPDATE, "BROUGHT TO YOU BY FEAR. ( LAUGHTER ). FEAR IT'S-- WHAT WAS THAT! WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE WORLD OF VIRUSES.
AA MUITATE BIRD FLU THAT IS PARTICULARLY MENACING BECAUSE IT CAN BE PASSED BETWEEN HUMANS.
Jon:  EVERYBODY BACK! EVERYBODY BACK! ( LAUGHTER ) KEEP AWAY FROM ME! YOU GUYS HAVE BIRD FLU! I CAN TASTE IT ON YOU! AND IT TASTES SOMETHING LIKE CHICKEN. DON'T WORRY, THIS IS A PURELE RIFLE. IT SHOOTS HIGH-POWERED PURELE. AND MY TBES IS I AM NOT-- GUESS IS I AM NOT HOLDING THIS IN A PARTICULARLY NECESSARY FASHION. ( LAUGHTER ) KEEP IT TOGETHER, STEWART. KEEP ACTING THROUGHOUT THIS BIT. ( LAUGHTER ). THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, RIGHT? NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. NATURE CREATES GENETIC MUTATIONS AND VIRUSES ALL THE TIME. IT'S A RANDOM THING, VERY UNLIKELY TO BE REPLICATED.
SCIENTISTS HERE ENGINEERED THE NEW VIRUS BY MANIPULATING JUST A FEW GENES. ALL SIDES AGREE THE MUTATED BIRD FLU VIRUS CREATED BY SCIENTISTS IN ROTTERDAM COULD KILL MILLIONS  IF IT GETS OUT.
Jon:  TWO THINGS. ONE, WE MADE THIS? AND, TWO, IF IT GETS OUT? ( LAUGHTER ) IT WILL GET OUT. LET ME TELL PLAY A LITTLE KEEP OUT YOU FOR THE MORNING. WITH WITH THE MANN IN THIS MOSQUITO, WE CAN BRING BACK DINOSAURS. ISN'T THERE A CHANCE OF BREAK FREE AND BECOME KILLING MACHINES? NO I INSTALLED LOCKS AND ELECTRICITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) ISN'T THERE ANY WAY WE CAN PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THIS  DOOMSDAY VIRUS?
INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THE BEST WAY TO--
LAMINATE YOUR SKIN SO THE GERMS CAN'T GET IN, NOBODY TOUCH  ANYBODY AGAIN, AND EVERYBODY LIVE INSIDE OVER-SIZED HAMPSTER BALLS, AND I MEAN THE PLASTIC  ONES, NOT ACTUAL HAMP STERS' BALLS THAT-- WHY DON'T I LET THE MAN FINISH HIS REPORT.
INTERNAL HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IS RELEASE THE RESEARCH.
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WILL RELEASE FULL DETAILS NOW OF  TWO STUDIES ON THE BIRD FLU.
Jon:  WHAT? WAIT, WHAT? RELEASE THE RESEARCH ON HOW YOU MUTATED THE BIRD FLU VIRUS TO US? HAVE YOU MET US? ( LAUGHTER ) WE CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH THAT INFORMATION. WE CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET AND A FORK. YOU KNOW WHY THERE ARE LITTLE ACTETS OF SILICON GELS THISP THAT COME WITH YOUR SHOES SAY, "DO NOT EAT ON THEM," BECAUSE WE WOULD EAT THEM. TO BE FAIR THE INFORMATION WAS GOING TO GET OUT SOONERRER LATER. YOU KNOW IF THEY TRIED TO KEEP THE INFORMATION SECRET IT WOULD HAVE WOUND UP ON WIKIBEAKS, THE  WIKILEAKS EQUIVALENT RUN BY PENGUIN ASSANGE. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT REALLY FELT MORE LIKE PITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE? ( LAUGHTER ) COME ON! RELEASING THE INFORMATION ON HOW YOU MUTATED THAT VIRUS TO THE PUBLIC? WHAT DO SECURITY EXPERTS THINK OF THIS?
SECURITY EXPERTS SAY IT IS CRAZY TO LET THESE SECRETS GET INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS.
I AGREE WITH PEOPLE THAT SAY IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT A TERRORIST  COULD ACTUALLY USE THIS TO CREATE A PANDEMIC, BUT NOT LIKELY IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
Jon:  TERRORISTS, I ( BLEEP ) DIDN'T THINK OF THAT. TERRORISTS? AND NOT LIKELY? PEOPLE SAID IT WASN'T LIKELY THAT MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE'S DAD  WOULD BUILD A REPUBLICAN EMPIRE OUT OF AN R.V. AND A BOTTLE OF SUDAFED. BUT LOOK WHAT HE DID. EVEN IF TERRORISTS NEVER MANAGE TO WEAPONNIZE THE BIRD FLU, THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT COULDN'T  EVENTUALLY MAKE THE LEAP TO HUMANS. I EVEN KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THE MAN WHO COULD START THE NEXT BIRD FLU PANDEMIC, PATIENT ZERO, IF YOU WILL.
IT TAKES A TOUGH MAN TO MAKE A TENDER FORECAST, NICK. KEEP ( BLEEP ) THAT CHICKEN.
OKAY, I'LL DO THAT.
ALL RIGHT.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  YOU SEE THE FACE SHE'S MAKING? HE JUST GAVE HER THE BIRD FLU. THAT'S HOW EASY.
