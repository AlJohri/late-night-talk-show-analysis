Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT THE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMAN MICROBIOME PROGRAM AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED MISSING MICROBES: HOW THE OVERUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS IS FUELING OUR MODERN PLAGUES. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARTIN BLASER, SIR! (LAUGHTER) SORRY. MISSING MICROBES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT FOR SOME TIME. BUT THERE'S APPARENTLY A GOOD DEAL OF SCIENCE BEHIND THE IDEA THAT I SHOULDN'T BE TAKING Z-PAKS BECAUSE I'M TIRED. WHAT IS THE OVERUSE OF ANTI-BIOTICS, WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING?
YOU KNOW, ANTI-BIOTICS ARE MIRACULOUS. THEY HAVE SAVED SO MANY LIVES. BUT WE'VE BEEN USING THEM MORE AND MORE AND MORE. AND WE HAVE REACHED THE POINT WHERE MAYBE WE'RE DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
Jon: HOW DO WE KNOW? BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT DOING SOMETHING, YOU SEE THE SAME THING WITH THE ANTI-VACCINE CROWD. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS EFFECTING A MUCH LARGER GROUP BECAUSE IT'S NOT IMMEDIATE AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT US.
WELL, TAKING ANTI-BIOTICS HAS A LOT OF EFFECTS. ONE OF THEM IS LIKE WITH THE VACCINES, IS THAT IF YOU TAKE ANTI-BIOTICS IT'S GONNA MAKE ALL THE BACTERIA IN THE WORLD RESISTANT. IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT WHAT I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT ANTI-BIOTICS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IS MAKING THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALL THESE DISEASES THAT HAVE BEEN RISING, DIABETES, OBESITY ALLERGIES, FOOD ALLERGIES.
Jon: BUT THAT'S THE PART I DON'T UNDERSTAND. SO LET'S SAY MY DAUGHTER GETS STREP THROAT. HAS THE LITTLE SWAB IN HER MOUTH, COMES UP POSITIVE. YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT THAT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY BE A REAL STREP INFECTION BUT IT JUST MAY BE THAT THERE IS A COLONIZATION OF STREP NOT CAUSING THE SYMPTOMS.
YEAH. SHE IS-- SHE'S AT LEAST CARRYING STREP. WE KNOW THAT EVERY WINTER 20% OF THE KIDS ARE CARRYING STREP. IN THE SUMMER IT GOES DOWN TO 10%. SO IF YOU RANDOMLY CHECK THE THROAT OF KIDS, 20% OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE POSITIVE. SO WE DON'T KNOW A PRIORI IF THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING HER INFECTION.
Jon: I WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE THE JOB TO RANDOMLY CHECK KID'S THROATS BECAUSE THAT IS, THAT IS THE THING IN THE DOCTOR WHERE YOU GO, YOU CAN HOLD HER ARMS AND DO THIS. WHEN WE DO THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU MENTION OBESITY, ALLERGIES, ASTHMA. TO ME IF THOSE ARE NOT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS, HOW IS IT THAT USING ANTI-BIOTICS WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON AN ALLERGY.
BECAUSE, BECAUSE OF THE HUMAN MICROBIOME. BECAUSE MOST OF THE CELLS IN OUR BODY ARE BACTERIA. AND WE'VE HAD IT SINCE WE WERE BORN AND OUR MOTHERS GAVE ITS TO US AND THEIR MOTHERS. AND THEY'RE DOING IMPORTANT JOBS FOR US.
Jon: NOW YOU WRITE, IT'S 10 TO 1, THAT WE ARE OUTNUMBERED IN OUR OWN BODIES --
YES.
Jon: CELLULARLY 10 TO 1 BY BACTERIA.
YEAH. AND THEY'RE HELPING US, TRAINING OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM, HELPING US DIGEST FOOD --
Jon: RIGHT. MAKING VITAMINS FOR US. SO WE NEED THEM. THEY'RE GOOD FOR US. AND IF WE KEEP PILING ON WITH THE ANTI-BIOTICS THAN WE ARE SUPPRESSING THEM. AND SOME OF THEM ARE GOING AWAY, PROBABLY FOR GOOD.
Jon: CAN'T WE JUST IN THE WAY THAT YOU TARGET IT -- YOU KNOW, CANCER TREATMENT IS VERY SIMILAR, CHEMO KILLS EVERYBODY. CANCER CELLS BUT ALSO ALL THE HEALTHY CELLS. ISN'T THERE SOME WAY THAT THE ANTI-BIOTICS CAN BE USED TO KILL THE STREP BUT THERE CAN BE SOME WAY OF REJUVENATING THE MICROBIOME THAT THAT WAS DOING ALL THOSE OTHER JOBS?
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE NEED TO MAKE NARROW SPECTRUM ANTI-BIOTICS. WE HAVE BROAD SPECTRUM THAT ATTACK EVERYTHING. BUT WE HAVE THE SCIENCE THAT WE COULD DEVELOP NARROW SPECTRUM ANTI-BIOTICS THAT WILL JUST TARGET THE ONE ORGANISM, MAYBE IT'S STREP, MAYBE IT'S A DIFFERENT ORGANISM --
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THEN WE NEED THE DIAGNOSTIC SO THAT SOMEBODY GOING TO A DOCTOR THEY'LL SAY YOU HAVE A VIRUS, YOU HAVE A BACTERIA. IF YOU HAVE A BACTERIA, WHICH ONE IS IT.
NOW, ISN'T THIS WHERE THE GENOME TYPE PROJECTS WILL GO ON, BECAUSE FINDING THE GENETIC MAKEUP OF THESE BACTERIA, WON'T THAT ALLOW US TO TARGET THESE THINGS MORE SPECIFICALLY?
YEAH, WE HAVE SO MUCH GENOMIC INFORMATION, WE CAN HARNESS THAT TO MAKE BETTER MEDICINE.
Jon: SO, WHY -- OKAY, LET'S DO THAT.
YEAH. SO WE HAVE TO RIGHT NOW ANTI-BIOTICS ARE SEEM TO BE VERY INEXPENSIVE. AND DOCTORS VISITS ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE.
Jon: YES. BUT IF WE'RE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING THEN ULTIMATELY IT'S GONNA COST US MUCH MORE.
WHO WOULD DO THE THING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, COME UP WITH THE TARGETED-- IS THAT DRUG COMPANIES, IS THAT IT CAN ONLY ON DONE THROUGH THE CDC? LIKE WHO WOULD DO THAT, WOULD YOU DO IT, CAN I ASK YOU TO DO IT NOW IN FRONT OF US? WHAT, WHAT -- HOW IS IT THAT WE TAKE THAT ON?
THAT'S, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TAXES FOR. THAT'S OUR TAX DOLLARS, JUST WHEN WE NEED TAXES TO BUILD A ROAD THAT EVERYBODY USES. WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE DRUGS THAT OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS ARE GOING TO USE SO THAT THESE EPIDEMICS CAN BE STOPPED.
Jon: LET'S SAY SO COULD THERE BE A MANHATTAN PROJECT? SINCE THAT'S THE CATCHALL FOR THESE TYPES OF, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO PUT US ON THE MOON. SOME WOULD SUGGEST IN TEN YEARS IS THAT A REALISTIC GOAL?
I THINK IT IS. I THINK IT IS. WE NEED BOTH DIAGNOSTICS AND WE NEED NARROW SPECTRUM AGENTS. AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE ECONOMIC BASE OF HOW WE ASSESS ILLNESS IN KIDS AND HOW WE TREAT KIDS, HOW WE PAY DOCTORS SO THAT WE REALLY VALUE THAT MORE.
Jon: SEE, WHEN YOU THREW IN THAT LAST PART, THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE OH THAT WILL NEVER GET DONE. BUT THE SCIENCE PART OF IT FEELS LIKE IT COULD. BUT THE SYSTEM'S END OF IT FEELS LIKE IT'S IN-- IT'S MUCH MORE RECALCITRANT THAN THE REST OF EVERYTHING ELSE, MUCH HARDER TO MOVE.
IT IS HARD TO MOVE. BUT THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE BOOK.
Jon: SO THIS BOOK IS -- (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) VERY, VERY INTERESTING. SO YOU'RE OPTIMISTIC.
YES.
Jon: AND YOU DON'T MIND THAT I'M STILL GOING TO TAKE ANTI-BIOTICS AND USE PUREL.
OF COURSE THAT'S YOUR DECISION.
Jon: ALREADY MADE. MISSING MICROBES IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, IT'S FASCINATING STUFF, THANK YOU, SIR. DOCTOR, NICE TO SEE YOU.
