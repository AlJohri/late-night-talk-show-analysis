Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AFTER ADDRESSING THE IOWA HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE LAST YEAR  IN OPPOSITION TO A PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BAN GAY MARRIAGE IN IOWA, THE  VIDEO OF HIS SPEECH WENT VIRAL. HIS NEW BOOK IS OUT CALLED MY TWO MOMS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ZACH WAHLS. SIR, WHAT'S UP, MAN. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  SIT DOWN. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS, SIR. HOW DARE YOU?
WHAT CAN I SAY?
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M DOING ALL RIGHT.
Jon: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 20.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THIS BOOK, MY TWO MOMS, I WANT TO SAY TO YOU THIS. I WANT YOU AND YOUR TWO MOMS TO RAISE MY KIDS. WOULD THAT BE OKAY? THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL DEPICTION OF CHARACTER. YOU TOOK THE BOY SCOUT....
SCOUT LAW WHICH IS THE 12 TENETS. TRUST WORTHY, LOYAL, HELPFUL, FRIENDLY, COURTEOUS, KIND, OBEDIENT, CHEERFUL, THRIFTY BRAVE, CLEAN AND REVERENT.
Jon: YOU FORGOT DOPEY AND SLEEPY AND BLITZEN. AND YOU BROKE IT DOWN. YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOUR MOMS INSTILLED THOSE VALUES INTO YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: AS A YOUNGSTER.
YEAH. I MEAN EACH CHAPTER IS AN EXAMINATION OF THE VALUE I LEARNED IN THE BOY SCOUTS, HOW  MY MOMS TAUGHT IT TO ME. WHAT IT MEANS TO ME. MORE GENERALLY WHAT IT MEANS TO THIS WHOLE DEBATE. A CHAPTER LIKE LOYALTY ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THIS DEBATE WHEN MY MOM TERRY WAS  DIAGNOSED WITH M.S., JACKIE MY SHORT MOM....
Jon: HOLD ON A SECOND, I'M WAIT TO GO SEE IF THAT'S HOW MY KIDS DESCRIBE ME. I'VE JUST SEEN A BOOK THAT THEY'RE WRITING CALLED MY SHORT PARENT.
TERRY IS LIKE 5'11". SO IT'S A WAY TO KEEP THEM APART. THEY WEREN'T MARRIED WHEN TERRY WAS DIAGNOSED WITH M.S.SO SHE COULD HAVE LEFT. SHE DIDN'T. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT ALL THOSE VALUES FROM MY MOMS.
Jon: IT'S A WONDERFUL LESSON BUT ALSO I THOUGHT THAT PARTICULAR AREA WAS IMPORTANT  FOR THE PRACTICALITY OF THE DEBATE BECAUSE JACKIE... YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THERE ARE ABOUT  120 RIGHTS THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED MUCH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY TREATED  JACKIE IN THE HOSPITAL WITH YOUR MOM AS A STRANGER.
THAT'S RIGHT. TERRY, AS PART OF OUR M.S.SYMPTOMS HAS THIS DEBILITATING PACE FEIGN AND  THERE WAS AN EPISODE IN 2006 THAT GOT SO BAD THEY HAD TO GO TO THE E.R. TERRY TO SUFFER THROUGH THE MOST SINGLE PAINFUL NIGHT OF HER LIFE. SHE'S A WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO MY LITTLE SISTER WITH NO ANESTHESIA. SHE'S AWESOME. SHE'S OUT HERE TOO. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS. ARE ARE THEY ALL HERE?
RIGHT THERE.
Jon: ARE YOU WITH THE AUTHOR? GET IN THE BACK.
AND THE REASON THAT WAS THE CASE WAS BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WHO WAS RUNNING THE E.R.AT  THAT POINT WAS NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED TO LISTEN TO JACKIE BECAUSE JACKIE WASN'T TERRY'S WIFE. SHE WAS JUST THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT THE PATIENT IN. JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE REALITIES OF THE STRUGGLES THAT L.G.B.T. PEOPLE IN THIS  COUNTRY FACE EVERY DAY.
Jon: IT STRIKES ME AS WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT THE BOOK IS IT IS WRITTEN FROM THE  PERSPECTIVE OF A POSITIVE PERSPECTIVE ON IT BUT PERFECT JUDO BECAUSE IF THE IDEA IS, OH, WELL, CHILDREN NEED A MOM AND A DAD OR THEY WON'T BE RAISED TO HAVE THE VALUES THAT  THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR, THESE ARE THE VALUES THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. I DON'T THINK I'VE MET ANYBODY THAT REPRESENTS THEM BETTER THAN YOU. IT SPEAKS AMAZINGLY FOR YOUR FAMILY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S A BIG HONOR. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THIS IS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO  AGREE WITH YOU, I REALLY HOPE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SURE WILL READ THIS. AREN'T YOU ALSO WORKING ON ANOTHER PROJECT ABOUT THAT.
THAT IS CALLED "OUT TO DINNER." OUT TO DINNER DOT-ORG. WE'RE INVITING STRAIGHT COUPLES TO HOST THESE DINNERS IN WHICH THEY INVITE AN  L.G.B.T. COUPLE AND FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE FENCE ABOUT THE WHOLE GAY THING. AND THEN JUST COME TOGETHER AND, YOU KNOW, BREAK SOME BREAD AND SHARE A BOTTLE OF WINE OR FOUR. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
Jon: THAT'S WHEN IT GETS GOOD.
EXACTLY. AND THEN JUST GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND HAVE A GREAT TIME. I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE IS  HAVING TO A FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATION AND GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER IN A WAY THAT  TRANSCENDS THESE SODOM EYES TAKING OVER OUR TOWNS AND CITIES WHICH OBVIOUSLY....
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING IN FRONT OF ALL OF US YOUR FAMILIES ARE NOT GODLESS SODOM  EYES TAKING OVER OUR CITIES. THAT IS THE CLAIM YOU ARE MAKING TODAY, SIR.
THIS IS ON TV, RIGHT.
Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE ON TV. ISN'T IT ALWAYS ABOUT THAT? OFTENTIMES YOU COUCH IT IN WELL IT'S JUST BIGOTRY. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST NOT HAVING EXPERIENCE WITH SOMETHING. ONCE YOU DO, YOU GO, OH, HUMANITY. THE SAME ON ALL SIDES. I GET IT. YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO LIVE YOUR LIFE AND RAISE YOUR KIDS AND DO THE RIGHT THING.
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENCES THAT PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES GET HUNG UP ON LIKE  THE FACT THAT I'M REALLY GOOD AT PUTTING THE SEAT DOWN OR USING A RAZOR OR WHATEVER.
Jon: (LAUGHING) WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ALL RIGHT, KID. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK. YOU WILL LOVE IT. YOU WILL WEEP AT TIMES. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE POWER OF REAL VALUES. YOU, SIR, ARE THE EMBODIMENT OF IT. I BELIEVE AND I SAY THIS TO YOU WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU ARE PEA K-ING TOO SOON. I EXPECT BIG THINGS FROM YOU. MY TWO MOMS. PLEASE BUY IT.
