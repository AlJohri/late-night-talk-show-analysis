Jon: IT'S OBVIOUSLY, IT'S NOT REALLY A CONTEST.
Stephen: NOT ANYMORE, JON. BECAUSE YOU SEE, JON ALMOST NINE YEARS AGO I PROMISED TO CHANGE THE WORLD, AND TOGETHER I DID IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO --
Stephen: SO, I DON'T KNOW, JON. I'M A FREE MAN NOW. I'M NOT SURE WHAT -- I'LL GO WHEREVER THE WIND TAKES ME, JON. MAYBE RIDE THE RAILS. LIVE BOXCAR TO BOXCAR. LEARN HOW TO WHIP UP A HEARTY STEW FROM PEANUT SHELLS AND A STOLEN CHICKEN. SURE, I KNOW IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH, JON BUT IT'S A KING'S FEAST TO ME AND MY COMPANIONS. BISCUIT, THE WILY MOUSE THAT LIVES IN MY WEE POCKET. AND ANNABELLE THE ONE EYED PROSTITUTE WHO HAS A HEART OF GOLD. AND DON'T YOU DARE CALL HER A WHORE, JON.
Jon: I WASN'T SAYING ANYTHING. STEPHEN, YOU HAVE A GIFT. WHY DON'T YOU STAY IN TELEVISION? I HEARD THIS DAVID LETTERMAN IS RETIRING.
Stephen: YEAH I HEARD THAT, TOO, JON BUT THEY ALREADY GAVE THE PART TO SOME FAT GUY. TIMING SHE'S A CRUEL MISTRESS.
Jon: SHE IS. BUT DON'T SAY FAT. PEAR SHAPED. THAT'S ALL. HE'S GOT --
Stephen: DON'T BE KIND TO HIM, JON. I'VE SEEN THE PHOTOS.
Jon: NO, THEY ARE CALLED BIRTHING HIPS. THEY'RE FINE.  STEPHEN, WELL THANKS FOR COMING BY. I WISH YOU AND BISCUIT, BISCUIT IS IT?
Stephen: IT WAS BISCUIT, JON, IN ME WEE POCKET.
Jon: IN YOUR WEE POCEKT. I WISH YOU BOTH AND THE ONE EYED WOMAN, I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST OF LUCK. I REALLY DO.
Stephen: HOLD BACK THE TEARS, JON.
Jon: OK.
Stephen: YOU'LL BE FINE. > Jon: THANKS FOR COMING.
Stephen: YOU KNOW, JON, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, THERE'S SOMETHING I WOULD APPRECIATE AS A PARTING GIFT. YOU KNOW HOW WHEN SOMEONE LEAVES "THE DAILY SHOW" YOU GUYS PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT REEL?
Jon: SURE, WE JUST DID ONE FOR YOUNG JOHN OLIVER.
Stephen: YEAH, I SAW THAT. BUT JON, YOU NEVER DID ONE FOR ME.
Stephen: YOU NEVER LEFT. YOU WENT TO 11:30. YOU ARE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.
Stephen: YOU'RE RIGHT, JON. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT PROBABLY WASN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO ME.
Jon: WE'LL PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER, STEPHEN. WE'LL PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER. WE'LL DO SOME OF YOUR BEST MOMENTS.
Stephen: DON'T TROUBLE YOURSELF, JON. I ALREADY DID. IT'S STEAMY IN HERE RIGHT NOW. YOU COULD PUT SOME FLOUR AND YEAST IN MY PANTS AND PULL OUT A PARMESEAN BAGUETTE. MY FATHER WAS A POOR VIRGINIAN TURD MINER. THESE ARE THE GOATEES OF FREEDOM. FACT BECOMES IRRELEVANT. TRUTH BECOMES FICTION. KNOWLEDGE BECOMES IGNORANCE. NIGHT BECOMES DAY. CHAOS REIGNS. TAXI! FOR LO! I WIN! I WIN! I WIN! MY FATHER'S FATHER WAS A GOAT BALL LICKER. TO RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH YOUR RAVEN HAIR TO TOUCH YOUR MILK WHITE SKIN. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Stephen: WELL JON, I'M REALLY GOING TO MISS ME.
Jon: AND WE ARE TOO, MY FRIEND. GODSPEED. STEPHEN COLBERT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
