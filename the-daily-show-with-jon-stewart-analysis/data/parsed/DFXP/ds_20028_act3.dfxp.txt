Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE'S GOT NEW FILM THAT'S CALLED "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING."
ONE, TWO, THREE.
MY GOD, HOW DOES JANE MANAGE? STEVEN, YOUR MOTOR-MOUTH DISEASE, DOES IT AFFECT?
WHAT?
EVERYTHING?
WHAT, NO? JUST WHAT ISN'T AUTOMATIC.
YOU SERIOUS? WELL, THAT'S PRETTY WONDERFUL ISN'T IT? WELL, IT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS A LOT ABOUT MEN.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME EDDIE REDMAYNE. [APPLAUSE] YOUNG MAN, HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: I'M DOING VERY WELL. I'M DOING VERY WELL. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IN A SEASON OF WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES, THIS HAS BEEN A SEASON OF WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES IN FILMS, YOUR PERFORMANCES, YOUR STEVEN HAWKINGS PERFORMANCE IN THIS FILM IS FOR ME ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DID IT EVEN PHYSICALLY. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT, YOU EMBODIED TO THE POINT WHERE STEVEN HAWKINGS I THINK HAS SAID I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING MYSELF WHEN I SAW YOU. IT WAS AMAZING.
THAT WAS A VERY KIND THING HE SAID. BUT THANK YOU. NO, IT WAS AN AMAZING. FOR ME, HAVING THE PRIVILEGE TO PLAY HIM WAS JUST THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING. AND THE EXTRAORDINARY THING WAS ALSO YOU, I THINK YOU WERE AT THE PREMIERE.
Jon:  I WAS AT THE PREMIERE WHEN YOU GUYS PREMIERED IN TORONTO.
IN TORONTO. I WAS SO NERVOUS AND I HAD LITERALLY COME OFF STAGE AND THE REACTION HAD BEEN KIND TO THE FILM --
Jon: YEAH, THE AUDIENCE WENT NUTTY.
AND YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON I SAW, AND WE HAD NEVER MET. AND I VIRTUALLY SNOGGED YOU. I BASICALLY ALMOST KISSED YOU I WAS SO EXCITED.
Jon: HE WAS VERY EXCITED AND THEN I BELIEVE I JUST FOLLOWED YOU AROUND THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. NEVER ATTAINED THAT HEIGHT AGAIN. NEVER ATTAINED THAT -- IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GRATIFYING. EVEN JUST THE PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION YOU WENT THROUGH, HOW DO YOU, WERE THERE PROSTHETICS INVOLVED, HOW DID YOU EMBODY HIS PHYSICAL DECLINE?
WELL, I CAN'T, IF YOU GET CAST IN A PART LIKE THIS, SOMEONE AS EXTRAORDINARY AS STEPHEN YOU KIND OF -- CHARLIE COX IS ANOTHER ACTOR IN THE FILM AN OLD FRIEND WHO SAID WHEN I GOT CAST IF YOU GET THAT OPPORTUNITY YOU KIND OF HAVE NO OPTION BUT TO GIVE YOUR EVERYTHING. AND SO AS SOON AS I GOT CAST I BASICALLY WENT TO AN ALS CLINIC AND STARTED KIND OF EDUCATING MYSELF ON THE DISEASE AND MEETING PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED FROM IT. AND IT'S SUCH A BRUTAL DISEASE. BUT THEN ALSO MEETING STEVE AND GETTING TO SPEND A BIT OF TIME WITH HIM. I WORKED WITH A DANCER WHO HELPED SORT OF FIND THE PHYSICALITY IN MY BODY. IT WAS A LONG PROCESS, BUT A WONDERFUL ONE.
Jon: AND IT NEVER FEELS CONTRIVED. IT ALWAYS SEEMED NATURAL. WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE WITH ALS AND YOU'RE SAYING TO THEM I'M GOING TO PLAY SOMEONE WHO SUFFERS FROM A SIMILAR DISEASE, ARE THEY,  DOES IT GIVE THEM ANY JOY OR DOES IT HELP THEM TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH?  DO THEY FEEL LIKE OH THAT'S GREAT, THANKS, DRAMATIZE THAT, THAT'S WONDERFUL. LIKE WHAT'S THEIR, WHAT'S THEIR SENSE OF IT?
NO, IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. I MEAN, I WENT TO THESE CLINICS EVERY WEEK OR TWO IN LONDON AND THE SPECIALISTS WOULD MEET THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING. AND AT THE END SHE WOULD SAY LOOK, THERE'S AN ACTOR HERE WHO'S PLAYING STEPHEN HAWKING AND BECAUSE STEPHEN WAS GIVEN TWO YEARS TO LIVE BUT HAS SORT OF BROKEN ALL THE RULES. AND IT'S A REAL ANOMALY. HE'S SURVIVED OVER 50 YEARS. HE'S ALSO A GREAT A BASTION OF HOPE AND ACROSS THE BOARD PEOPLE WERE SO GENEROUS AND THEY WOULD --
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE YOU DO FEEL THAT SENSITIVITY OF ARE YOU --
Jon: SURE.
BUT THEY WOULD LET ME LET ME, THINGS LIKE FEEL THEIR, FEEL WHAT THE MUSCLES FEEL LIKE. AND THERE ARE THESE THINGS CALLED FASCICULATIONS, THESE LITTLE SPASMS THAT GO THROUGH, THAT REALLY THEY WERE SO KEEN TO EDUCATE ME. AND IT WAS --
Jon: DOES IT FEEL LIKE,  IS THAT IT'S RIGID OR THAT IT STIFFENS OR WHAT HAPPENS?
WELL BASICALLY YOU HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED UPPER NEURONS AND LOWER NEURONS AND IF THE UPPER NEURONS GO THERE'S KIND OF RIGIDITY. AND IF THE LOWER NEURONS GO, IT'S A SORT OF, THERE'S A SOFTNESS. AND ALS IS A COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO. SO TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT STEPHEN'S SPECIFIC PROGRESSION WAS, THERE'S THIS BRILLIANT VIDEO ON YOUTUBE OF STEPHEN WHEN HE DID ZERO GRAVITY. IT'S KIND OF THE ONLY TIME YOU CAN SEE HIM OUT OF THE CHAIR AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT HIS UPPER AND WHAT HIS LOWER.
Jon: OH MY GOODNESS.
SO THAT WAS KIND OF HELPFUL TO TRY AND WORK OUT WHAT HIS PROGRESSION WAS.
Jon: RIGHT. IS IT, IS THERE A REASON WHY SCIENTIFICALLY THAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF FOR THIS LONG. HAVE THEY POINTED TO SOMETHING EITHER GENETICALLY OR WITHIN THE DIAGNOSIS.
WELL, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THE ANSWER IS NO. HE HAS BROKEN MANY RULES. THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE SPECIFIC STRAIN OF THE ILLNESS. STEPHEN, SINCE HE WAS DIAGNOSED AGE 21, HE'S HAD VERY LITTLE INTEREST. HE'S, THE ILLNESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN SECONDARY TO HIM.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT A LOT OF THE SPECIALISTS I MET ARE SO KEEN TO MEET HIM TO SEE WHAT IT IS.
Jon:  IS IT STRANGE THAT I NOW TALK TO YOU AS THOUGH YOU'RE A NEUROSCIENTIST.
IT IS, IT IS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LIKE REALLY, YOU ARE. NOW YOU'RE LIKE MY EXPERT. IF EVER I HAVE LIKE A SCIENCE QUESTION OR LIKE A HEALTH QUESTION I AM GOING TO CALL YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE FEEL FREE. DON'T EXPECT A LENGTHY ANSWER. I KNOW THAT YOU HAD JESSICA ON LAST NIGHT.
Jon: YES.
AND PEOPLE KEEP SAYING I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN "INTERSTELLAR" TO ME.
Jon: YES.
AND I SORT OF, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF I DON'T SEE IT THEN I WON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
Jon: YOU WON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING. I'M HAVING, THIS IS A WHOLE WEEK, I'M HAVING ACTORS ON OF MOVIES THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE THAN MINE. IT'S A WHOLE WEEK WHERE I BROUGHT PEOPLE ON. AND THEN THEY COME ON AND I GO LIKE YOUR MOVIE'S GREAT. ALTHOUGH ...
I WENT AND SAW YOUR FILM.
Jon:  DID YOU GO?
I SAW IT THIS WEEK. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
Jon: THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. I SAW YOURS. I DIDN'T PAY, BUT I'LL GO PAY NOW. [APPLAUSE] IT'S REALLY A REMARKABLE FILM, REMARKABLE PERFOILANCE AND I DID I SLOBBERED ALL OVER YOU GUYS AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED AND IT WAS SUCH A GREAT THING.
THANK YOU, MAN.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: "THEORY OF EVERYTHING" IS IN THEATERS NOW. EDDIE REDMAYNE.
