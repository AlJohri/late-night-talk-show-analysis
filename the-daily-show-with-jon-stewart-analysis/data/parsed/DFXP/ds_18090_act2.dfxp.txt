Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO LAST WEEK AS WE WERE  WATCH ON THE SHOW, LAST WEEK  WE LEARNED THAT WHILE OUR  UNITED STATES SENATE WAS UNABLE TO PASS EVEN THE MOST  BASIC GUN CONTROL MEASURES,  AUSTRALIA HAD A SUCCESSFUL GUN CONTROL FOR ALMOST TWO  DECADE, JOHN OLIVER VISITED  THERE TO FIND OUT MORE IN PART TWO OF OUR THREE PART  SERIES.
IN 1996 FOLLOWING A  MASSACRE, AUSTRALIA'S  CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT  ENFORCED A NATIONAL BUYBACK OF SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS. WHILE ALSO HEAVILY  REGULATING THE PURCHASE AND  STORAGE OF OTHER FIREARMS. THE RESULT WAS DRAMATICALLY  REDUCED LEVEL OF GUN  VIOLENCE. SO WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT  HERE? TO FIND OUT I SAT DOWN WITH  LONG TIME AID TO HARRY REID  JIM MANLY.
THE NRA IS STILL A VERY  POWERFUL FORCE IN THIS  COUNTRY. THEY HAVE FOUR MILLION  MEMBERS WHO ARE VERY, VERY  DETERMINED TO GET THEIR WAY.
AND HOW CAN A NATION OF  300 MILLION COMPETE WITH  THAT?
IT'S DIFFICULT TO  UNDERSTAND SOMETIME, ISN'T  IT BUT THE FACT OF THE MAT CERTIFICATE THAT I'VE GOT TO  THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE  YOU SUPPORT GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION BECAUSE YOU ARE  TAKE ON THE NRA CAN BE  POLITICAL SUICIDE.
AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY  IS WORKING TIRELESSLY TO  REDUCE THE RATE OF POLITICAL SUICIDE AMONG ITS MEMBERS. SURELY AUSTRALIAN  POLITICIANS WEREN'T STUPID  ENOUGH TO END THEIR  POLITICAL LIVES FOR GUN  CONTROL.
WELL, I DID.
WHAT?
I DID.
YOU DID WHAT?
I TOOK THE STAND. I WAS PREPARED TO FACE THE  POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES, AND  WE DELIVERED GUN CONTROL.
MEETS ROB BOREBICH FORMER  PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND,  AUSTRALIA'S MOST  CONSERVATIVE STATE. IN 1996 HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL  IN ENACTING GUN CONTROL,  KNOWING IT WOULD COST HIM  HIS POLITICAL CAREER IN THE NEXT ELECTION.
WE PAID A HIGH POLITICAL  PRICE BUT WE DID THE RIGHT  THING. LOOK, THERE ARE AUSTRALIANS  ALIVE TODAY BECAUSE WE TOOK  THAT ACTION. I MEAN HOW MUCH SAY LIFE  WORTH?
BUT JIM MANLY KNOWS THAT  THE TRUE PUBLIC SERVANT HAS  NOR IMPORTANT CONCERNS.
WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN  SUCCESSFUL?
GETTING RE-ELECTED BY HIS  OR HER CONSTITUENTS.
RIGHT, YEAH. THAT IS HOW YOU JUDGE  SUCCESS.
OKAY, THAT-- WELL,  GETTING LEGISLATION DONE.
IS SECOND.
IS SECOND, YES.
THAT IS SECOND. HOLLY [BLEEP], THAT IS  SECOND?
IF I COULD REWIND THIS  TAPE I WOULD SAY GETTING  LEGISLATION DONE AND GETTING RE-ELECTED BY YOUR  CONSTITUENTS.
BUT SERIOUSLY YOU CAN'T  REMIND-- REWIND THE TAPE  LET'S GO WITH THE ANSWER YOU  GAVE.
IF YOU DON'T GET  RE-ELECTED, YOU KNOW, YOU  JUST ROADKILL IN THE  POLITICAL PROCESS AND YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER LOSER.
TRAGICALLY NOT EVERYONE  UNDERSTANDS THIS.
WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN  SUCCESSFUL? GO.
MAKING SOCIETY A BETTER  PLACE.
NO, NO, NO, ROB, NO. LOOK, WE CAN-- WE CAN  ACTUALLY REWIND THE TAPE. ARE WE ROLLING? WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN  SUCCESSFUL.
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO  GOVERN IN THE BEST INTERESTS  OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU  SERVE.
LOOK, ROB, I'M GOING OUT  ON A LIMB HERE. I ALREADY TOLD SOMEONE ELSE  I CAN'T DO THIS WHEN I CAN.
I HOPE YOU HAVE A LOT OF  TAPE.
TRUE SUCCESS IS A  LIFELONG POLITICIAN LIKE  HARRY REID WHOSE WATERED  DOWN GUN LEGISLATION WAS CAREFULLY DESIGNED TO  PROTECT THOSE WHO NEEDED IT  MOST.
HE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY  AS THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER TO  PROTECT THE CAUCUS.
THE CAUCUS NEEDS TO BE  PROTECTED, THE CAUCUS DOES.
THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED  POLITICALLY.
HOW MANY POLITICAL  CAREERS HAVE BEEN TRAGICALLY  ENDED BY GUN CONTROL.
WE'VE LOST SOME GOOD  FOLKS OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE  OF THEIR VIEWS.
RIGHT. YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY  POLITICAL CAREER AND THEN  BANG.
JUST LIKE THAT.
WHICH MEANS FORMER  AUSTRALIA PRIME MINISTER  JOHN HOWARD HAS BLOOD ON HIS  HANDS.
DOW EVER THINK ABOUT THE  INNOCENT VICTIMS OF YOUR GUN  CONTROL.
THERE WERE NO INNOCENT  VICTIMS OF MY-- THERE WERE  NO VICTIMS AT ALL. THERE IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF  ROB, HE WAS INCREDIBLY  COURAGEOUS SUPPORTING OUR  LAWS.
BUT POLITICALLY HE IS  DEAD, BANG, JUST LIKE THAT.
WE LOST AN ELECTION AS WE  ALL DO AT SOME POINT.
BUT HOWARD IS NOT ALONE. HIS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER  TIM FISHER ALSO REFUSES TO  ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR  THESE CAREER MASSACRES.
OH, YOU DON'T LOOK AT  THESE FACES AND FEEL GUILT?
WELL, THEY ARE ALIVE. AND --
THEY'RE DEAD, THEY'RE  POLITICALLY DEAD.
I HOPE THAT THOSE WHO  TOTALLY VETO ANY MOVE TO  BRING SENSIBLE, SEMI AUCTION AND AUCTION WEAPON CONTROL  TO THE SUBURBS OF AMERICA  ARE ALSO POLITICALLY DEAD  BUT PHYSICALLY ALIVE.
NOT IN I COULD HELP IT. NEVER AGAIN WILL A POLITICAL  CAREER END IN A SENSELESS  ACT OF MEANINGFUL  LEGISLATION.
THE VERDICT IS JUST ALL  OF THESE, ALL OF THEM ARE  DEAD, POLITICALLY NOT PHYSICALLY, PHYSICALLY THEY  ARE PROBABLY SAFER.
IT IS VERY DARK.
I MEAN AGAIN, JUST TO  REITERATE PHYSICALLY THEY  ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE BUT IT MAKES YOU THINK.
UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT  SPENDING TIME WITH  POLITICALLY DEAD AUSTRALIA  POLITICIANS MADE ME THINK ABOUT WAS HOW HORRIBLY WRONG  WE HAVE IT IN AMERICA.
THANKS FOR SPEAK WITH ME  ROB.
PLEASURE.
ARE YOU A GREAT HUMAN  BEING.
THANK YOU.
IT'S JUST BY ALL AMERICAN  STANDARDS, YOU ARE A [BLEEP] POLITICIAN. AND THE FACT THAT THAT IS  TRUE IS WHY I AM NOW GOING  TO WALK INTO THE [BLEEP] OCEAN.
IN AMERICA WE'RE TOLD GUN  CONTROL IS NOT POSSIBLE. BUT IN AUSTRALIA, THEY HAVE  SHOWN IT IS. PROVIDING A FANTASTIC LESSON  FOR AMERICA TO IGNORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: JOHN OLVER, WE'LL BE
