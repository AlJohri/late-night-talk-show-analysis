Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS AN INTERNET SECURITY EXPERT WHO WAS ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER FROM 2006 TO 2008. SHE HAS COAUTHORED A NEW BOOK CALLED "PRIVACY IN THE AGE OF BIG DATA." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM THERESA PAYTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: IT'S A SHAME -- A SHAME -- MS. PAYTON THAT THIS IS NOT A MORE RELEVANT TOPIC. REALLY.
YEAH.
Jon: COULD THERE BE ANYTHING WITH THESE N.S.A. REVELATIONS AND EVERYTHING GOING ON. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT?
ALMOST A YEAR.
Jon: AND HOW LONG HAVE THEY >KNOWN THAT YOU WERE WORKING ON IT?
IMMEDIATELY.
Jon: PROBABLY BEFORE YOU WERE WORKING ON IT.
PROBABLY BEFORE I KNEW IT MYSELF.
Jon: IN YOUR MIND WHAT IS THE LARGEST THREAT TO EITHER OUR PRIVACY OR SECURITY THROUGH THESE ISSUES?
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S THE NOT KNOWING WHEN DATA IS BEING COLLECTED ABOUT YOU SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A VOICE IN  SAYING WAIT A MINUTE, DID I GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO COLLECT THAT AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROTECT IT? YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE UK TRYING TO BE GOOD CITIZENS THROWING TRASH AWAY AND THEIR PHONES SCANNED AS THEY ARE THROWING TRASH AWAY. DID THEY KNOW THAT?
Jon: WAIT, WHEN YOU ARE THROWING IN, THE TRASH GUYS ARE SCANNING IT. HOW ARE THEY SCANNING THEIR PHONES?
THEY HAD A LITTLE READER ON THE TRASH CAN SO AS LONG AS THEY HAD PROXIMITY TO YOUR PHONE THEY WERE ABLE TO SCAN YOUR PHONE AS YOU THREW AWAY TRASH.
Jon: WHO DID THAT?
A MARKETING COMPANY.
Jon: GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
YEAH. BUT WHERE IS THE LINE, BECAUSE, IF YOU GO ONLINE AND SHOP, IF YOU LIVE IN THIS WORLD UNLESS YOU WERE GOING OFF THE GRID AND GOD FORBID SHOP AT A BRICKS AND MORTAR I MEAN -- I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO -- HOW DO YOU AVOID IT?
I THINK PART OF IT IS JUST UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF THE PHONE, NOW OF COURSE THIS  TAKES A SMART PHONE AND TURNS IT INTO A DUMB PHONE BUT YOU CAN TURN OFF LOCATION, WiFi, BLUETOOTH SO YOU ARE NOT BROADCASTING TO EVERYBODY WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU ARE.
Jon: WHY NOT CALL THEM FROM HOME WHERE THE KITCHEN PHONE HAD THE WIRE WHERE COULD YOU WALK TO THE LIVING ROOM.
BUT THE FRIDGE MIGHT BE WATCHING YOU AND SENDING OUT TEXT MESSAGES.
Jon: THIS IS THE POINT, IT CAN ALWAYS BE USED BY NEFARIOUS INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS, BUT IT IS PART OF THE WAY WE LIVE NOW. IT IS AS THOUGH HIGHWAYS WERE ALSO FRAUGHT WITH PIRACY. THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING WE'RE DEALING WITH.
IT IS. ONE OF THE THINGS I HOPE PEOPLE TAKE AWAY FROM THE BOOK. I REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO BE INFORMED AND ENGAGED AND SOME PEOPLE WHO READ IT EARLY ON SAID I'M ALSO ENRAGED BUT YOU REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO  TAKE AWAY FROM THIS ON JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN COLLECT THE DATA, SHOULD YOU? AND HOW LONG SHOULD YOU STORE IT FOR? BECAUSE CHANCES ARE CRIMINALS WILL HACK THE DATA. IF YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IT, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROTECT IT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOURS IT'S ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT YOU.
Jon: AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. IN YOUR MIND, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS A MORE DANGEROUS ENTITY, THESE MORE CRIMINAL MISCHIEF MAKERS, CORPORATE MARKETING, OR GOVERNMENT SNOOPING?
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY KIND OF THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, CORPORATE THINKS THEY ARE DOING IT TO HELP YOU, TO GIVE YOU A BETTER EXPERIENCE, A BETTER PRODUCT. THE GOVERNMENT THINKS THEY ARE DOING IT TO HELP YOU TO GIVE YOU BETTER SECURITY TO PROTECT YOU. AND THE CYBER CRIMINALS, THEY JUST WANT AT THE DATA BECAUSE THEY WANT YOUR IDENTITY  THE WANT YOUR LIFE, THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THAT INFORMATION. AND THAT IS REALLY THE ELEMENT THAT I THINK IF WE CAN ALL BAND TOGETHER AND SAY, LET'S NOT COLLECT AND STORE DATA INDEFINITELY AND LET'S THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT BECAUSE THE BAD GUYS ARE GOING TO GET IT.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU GOING DO THAT, BECAUSE IF THE OTHER TWO ENTITIES, CORPORATIONS AND THE GOVERNMENT, FEEL THAT, OH NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOOD INTENTIONED AND DOING IT FOR A GOOD REASON, THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WE'RE KEEPING IT FOREVER. SO THEY'RE SAYING, BUT WE NEED TO DO THIS TO PROTECT YOU AND  THESE GUYS ARE SAYING, WELL THAT PRESENTS US WITH OPPORTUNITY.
I THINK THAT'S A NAIVE RESPONSE.
Jon: THAT'S BECAUSE I THOUGHT OF IT. [LAUGHTER] THAT HAPPENS TO BE MY M.O.
I THINK YOU ARE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT TED AND I WERE HOPING WOULD HAPPEN WITH THIS BOOK, WHICH IS WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOW YOU ARE DOING IT FOR GOOD INTENT BUT SINCE WE KNOW ALL DATABASES CAN BE HACKED, THE PENTAGON HAS BEEN HACKED, ANY OF THE BIG NAME INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, THEY'VE ALL HAD ISSUES WITH HACKINGS, EVERY PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY IS HACKABLE. SO KNOWING THAT, HOW DO YOU WANT TO PROTECT THAT DATA?
Jon: PERHAPS THEN IF ONLY THEY WOULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS THE EFFICACY OF BIG DATA? IF THE GOVERNMENT SAID HERE IS HOW IT WORKS THESE ALGORITHMS. IF CORPORATIONS CAME OUT AND SAID, DON'T YOU LIKE ADS THAT ONLY GO TO YOU WITH THINGS YOU ALSO ALREADY LIKE? THEN MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION. BUT RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT JUST HAPPENS TO US.
IT DOES, IT DOES JUST HAPPEN TO US. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT WE TALK ABOUT, SO FOR EXAMPLE, TARGET HAS FIGURED OUT WITH BIG DATA  THEY ACTUALLY KNOW YOU ARE PREGNANT BEFORE YOU KNOW OR BEFORE YOU ARE TELLING PEOPLE. NOT YOU PERSONALLY OBVIOUSLY BUT -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WITH TARGET SURE BECAUSE WHO WOULD EVER HACK INTO THOSE GUYS, I MEAN, THAT DATA IS-- THEY KNOW HOW TO PROTECT STUFF.
THAT DATA IS SECURE.
Jon: ON THAT NOTE -- WELL OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS THE DISCUSSION OF THE ERA. SO YOU'RE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF IT THERE. PRIVACY IN THE AGE OF BIG DATA. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THERESA PAYTON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
