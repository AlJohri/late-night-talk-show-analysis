Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THE GUEST TONIGHT, LISTEN TO  THIS, SETTLE DOWN. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, THAT'S  RIGHT, TODAY ON THE SHOW,  SUPREME COURT... THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SUPREME COURT JUSTICE  SONNIA SOTOMAYOR  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   UNLESS I BELIEVE SHE'S COMING OUT HERE. UNLESS THIS IS ANOTHER ELABORATE  HOAX BY MANTI TE'O NEMESIS  RONAIAH TUIASOSOPO OR AS THE GERMANS REFER TO HIM (SPEAKING  NONSENSE). SOME OF YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO  SEE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE  HERE, ONE, BECAUSE SHE IS A SITTING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE  AND TWO BECAUSE THIS AFTERNOON  SHE WAS IN WASHINGTON ADMINISTERING THE PUBLIC OATH OF  OFFICE TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE BIDEN JUST  WANTS TO HIGH-FIVE HER? THAT IS PROBABLY THE HARDEST  PART OF SWEARING IN BIDEN IS  EXPLAINING TO HIM THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO SWEAR. "HEY, HEY, DON'T WORRY,  SWEETHEART, I'LL HOLD THE [BLEEP] CONSTITUTION. I SWEAR. COME ON. GIVE ME ONE."  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR HAS BEEN VERY  BUSY. YESTERDAY AT 8:15 A.M. SHE DID  THE OFFICIAL NON-PAGEANTRY  VERSION OF THAT CEREMONY THE VICE PRESIDENT
THE REASON WHY IT WAS SO  EARLY IS THAT JUSTICE SEASONNIA  SOTOMAYOR HAD TO GET ON TO A TRAIN TO GET TO NEW YORK CITY TO  SIGN A NEW BOOK. SHE SAID SHE WAS TRYING TO GET  TO BARNES AND NOBLE THIS  AFTERNOON
Jon: NOW THAT'S FAIR. BIDEN CAN GET INAUGURATED ANY  TIME BUT IF THE JUSTICE WAITS  TOO LONG, THERE MAY NOT BE A BARNS AND NOBLE ANYMORE. BOOM! BRICKS AND MORTGAGE AND SLAM. ANYWAY, TO THE MAIN EVENT.
THE FIRST LADY AND THOSE NEW  BANGS
Jon: YES. IT'S A NEW HAIRCUT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF  SOMETHING FUN AND FLIRTY AT AGE  APPROPRIATE. SHE DOES IT. SHE DOES IT. I'M NOT DIMINISHING THE  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HAIR. THE POINT IS THIS. FIRST HUSBAND BARACK OBAMA HAD  HIS PUBLIC OATH ADMINISTERED  TODAY. REMEMBER WHEN THE TWO FAMOUSLY  FUMBLED
I WILL EXECUTE THE OFFICE OF  PRESIDENT TO THE UNITED STATES  FAITHFULLY
THAT I WILL EXECUTE THE  OFFICE...
FAITHFULLY, THE OFFICE OF  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
