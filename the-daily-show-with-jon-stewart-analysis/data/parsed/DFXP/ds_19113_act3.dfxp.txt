[ APPLAUSE ]
JON: WELOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS AN ACTIVIST WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY SOCIALISTS IN EGYPT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, GIGI IBRAHIM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
JON: FIRST OF ALL, GIGI, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW.
THANK YOU.
JON: THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE THERE WAS ALMOST EXULTATION. THERE WAS EXCITEMENT.
YES.
THE PEOPLE HAD TAKEN TO THE STREETS. THEY HAD TAKEN DOWN THIS AUTOCRAT WHO HAD BEEN THERE FOR 30 YEARS. SO, HOW'S IT BEEN GOING SINCE THEN?
WE DID IT AGAIN.
JON: YOU DID IT AGAIN.
YES. BUT, NOT SO SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME. WE MANAGED TO TOPPLE ANOTHER HEAD OF THE REGIME THAT WAS JUST THE FACE. BUT THE MILITARY --
JON: THAT WAS PRESIDENT MORSI OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
YES.
THEY WON THE ELECTION.
EXACTLY. AND, YOU KNOW, THE MILITARY SINCE 1952 REALLY HAS BEEN THERE AND HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE. AND IT'S JUST GETTING STRONGER. AND NOW WE HAVE THE FIRST PRESIDENT.
JON: YES.
THE HEAD OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMS FORCED.
JON: NOW THIS IS SISI.
SISI. ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI. HE IS NOW THE PRESIDENT WITH 96.6%.
JON: BOY, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT KIND OF NUMBER.
DEMOCRACY. YES. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME WE JUST MANAGE DO AN UPRISE AND KIND OF GET THE DEMANDS, THE FREEDOM BRED, SOCIAL JUSTICE THIS IS WHY WE DID THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO TAKE DOWN THE DICTATOR. NOW WE JUST GET WORSE AND WORSE. YOU CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AT THE LOWEST POINT OF THE REVOLUTION WITH OVER 41,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS IN JUST TEN MONTHS.
JON: INCREDIBLE. HERE IS WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT FOR ME TO COMPREHEND. THAT YOU CAN ALMOST SAY THAT MORSI THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WERE THE MORE LIBERAL REGIME. THEY WERE THE PROGRESSIVES COMPARED TO SISI. HE HAS PUT IN, THERE WAS MORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION UNDER THE BROTHERHOOD, IT SEEMS.
NOT EXACTLY YES, IT DEFINITELY WASN'T AS BAD. BUT MORSI DID HIS FARE SHARE TO DESERVE TO BE TAKEN DOWN AS WELL.
JON: YES, I JUST MEANT IT MORE COMPARATIVELY.
YES, IT GETS WORSE.
JON: IT GETS WORSE.
IT GETS WORSE BECAUSE THEN THE REVOLUTION IS DEEPENING, AND IT'S GETTING TO THE MILITARY AND THE INTEREST OF THE MILITARY. OF COURSE, THEY DON'T WANT THE REVOLUTION TO SUCCEED BECAUSE THEN THEY WOULD BE IN PRISON WITH THE BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS.
JON: YES. THEY HAVE INSTITUTED THINGS LIKE NO PROTEST. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED ANYMORE.
YES.
JON: AT LEAST UNDER THE BROTHERHOOD, PEOPLE DID COME OUT TO THE STREETS.
YES. AND, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS SAY MAYBE WE DIDN'T ACHIEVE ALL THE BIG DEMANDS OF THE  REVOLUTION. BUT AT LEAST WE BROKE THE BARRIER OF FEAR. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN EXPRESS THEMSELVES. WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, SOCIAL MEDIA. WE HAVE DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES ON TV THAT CAN, YOU KNOW, EXPRESS THE OPPOSITION.
JON: OR DID HAVE.
OR DID HAVE. AS YOU CAN SEE NOW EVERY LITTLE THING WE HAVE WON OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS REALLY WHETHER IT BE THE RIGHT TO PROTEST THAT WE WON WITH BLOOD AND TEARS REALLY. AND JUST LIVES OF REVOLUTIONARIES AND PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT THIS RIGHT TO GO OUT AND PROTEST. THEN YOU HAVE THE BIGGEST PROTEST IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY THE GOVERNMENT THAT COMES AFTER THIS MASS PROTEST, CRIMINALIZES PROTESTING. AND IMPRISONS OVER 41,000 POLITICAL PRISONERS.
JON: THE TEE SHIRT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY GOT ON THE JERSEY BOARDWALK.
NO. NO.
JON: WHAT IS, WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE?
THIS IS MAHIENOUR EL-MASSRY. SHE IS ONE OF THE BRAVEST, COURAGEOUS, SOCIALISTS, ACTIVISTS, AND REVOLUTIONARY, HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER AS WELL AND LABOR LAWYER. AND SHE HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO 2 YEARS IN PRISON ALONG WITH 7 OTHER PEOPLE.
JON: FOR.
FOR PROTESTING AT A KHALED SAID MURDER TRIAL IN ALEXANDERIA.
JON: NOW, EXPLAIN THAT. THAT'S A --
YES. KHALED SAID WAS MURDERED UNDER THE HANDS OF POLICE UNDER EMERGENCY LAW UNDER MUBARAK IN 2010. AND, HE HAS BEEN A GREAT CATALYST TO THE REVOLUTION. WHAT SPARKED THE YOUTH TO TAKE TO THE STREETS AND TOPPLE DOWN ESSENTIALLY MUBARAK AND HIS MURDERERS WERE ACQUITTED OR GIVEN A VERY WEAK SENTENCE. THEY WERE RETRIED AFTER CREATING SO MANY PRESSURES. AT THE TRIAL BACK IN LATE 2013, THE ALEXANDRIA ACTIVISTS, THEY WERE ROUNDED UP AND SENTENCED UNDER THE ANTI- PROTEST LAW THAT THE GOVERNMENT ENACTED LAST NOVEMBER. UNDER THAT LAW IT PRETTY MUCH IS LEGAL JUSTIFICATION TO JUST KILL OFF THE OPPOSITION AND WEAKEN THE REVOLUTION --
JON: AND THROW THEM IN JAIL.
AND THROW THEM IN JAIL.
JON: AND DO WHATEVER.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT, JAIL CONDITIONS HERE. YOU HAVE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.
JON: YES.
DENYING OF MEDICAL CARE. TORTURE. ABUSE. RAPE. YOU CAN THINK OF ANYTHING THAT IS SO INHUMANE IT'S BEING DONE IN EGYPTIAN PRISON AND NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. MASS DEATH PENALTY SENTENCES --
JON: IS THE MEDIA IN EGYPT ARE THEY ALLOWED TO BRING THIS UP IN ANYWAY?  ARE THEY  ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT MAHIENOUR?
NO. NOPE. NO. HOW CAN THEY TALK ABOUT MAHIENOUR AND THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE MAHIENOUR THAT ARE IN PRISON WHO JOINED THE REVOLUTION, WHO TOOK PART OR WHO HAVE BEEN JUST RANDOMLY ARRESTED. THEY TALK ABOUT THEM AS FIFTH COLUMNISTS TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. THAT THEY'RE TERRORISTS AND WANT TO BRING THE STATE DOWN. THEY VILIFY THEM IN THE MEDIA OR DON'T DISCUSS THEM AT ALL AND ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT THE FIRST AND THE FOREMOST THING WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS FIGHT TERRORISM. AND, THESE ARE THE TERRORISTS.
JON: OH. CAN YOU IMAGINE A COUNTRY THAT WOULD STRIP CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER THE GUISE OF FIGHTING TERRORISM? WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL, YOU AND I.
NO, NOPE, NOPE. YOU KNOW, WITH THE SYRIA ELECTIONS AND THE ELECTIONS, YOU KNOW, COMING UP WE ALL HAVE TO CHOOSE WITH THE RELATIVE, YOU KNOW --
JON: IT'S ALL ON A SCALE.
IT'S ALL ON A SCALE.  YES, BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS CHOOSING BETWEEN BAD AND WORST. [LAUGHING] AND THAT'S NOT A DEMOCRACY. THAT'S JUST NOT A DEMOCRACY.
JON: THAT'S THE WORST SUCCESSERY POSTER I HAVE HEARD. I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU ARE HERE. WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT? WE WILL TALK ABOUT OUR FRIEND BASSEM, WHAT'S GOING ON NOW WITH THE MOVEMENT. IF IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO BE HERE. BECAUSE NOW I'M CONCERNED. BECAUSE HOW MANY MOVIES CAN I WRITE? WE WILL BE BACK WITH MORE GIGI IBRAHIM.
