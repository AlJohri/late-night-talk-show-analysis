(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY, GOVERNOR ROMNEY IS PROBABLY COUNTED HIS RECORD IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT WOULD A  BUSINESSMAN PRESIDENT BE GOOD FOR AMERICA. WE HIT THE CONVENTION FLOOR TO FIND OUT.
WE'VE HEARD A LOT THIS WEEK ABOUT MITT ROMNEY'S NUMBER ONE QUALIFICATION FOR PRESIDENT.
MITT ROMNEY TURNED BUSINESSES AROUND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HE'S MADE A SUCCESS OF FAILING COMPANIES. AMERICA NEEDS A TURN AROUND AND THE MAN FOR THE JOB IS GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY.
AND WHY IS THAT?
I THINK GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO RUN MORE LIKE A BUSINESS.
THESE AREN'T EASY CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE BUT IF IT'S NOT WORKING YOU HAVE TO  END IT, IT'S GOT TO GO.
IF A-- IS FAILING, THEY DON'T REWARD IT, THEY SHUT  [BLEEP] DOWN.
EXACTLY.
ALWAYS LETTING THE MARKET DECIDE IS THE BEST THING TO DO.
WHAT IS THE WHERE ARE YOU FROM.
MISSISSIPPI, WHOA, WHOA, DEAD LAST IN PER-CAPITA INCOME. YOU WERE COSTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT $20 BILLION. THAT IS, YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LET THE MARKET DECIDE.
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHICH DIVISIONS OF AMERICA ARE SUCCEEDING AND  WHICH ARE FAILING, BECAUSE WHAT WAS THAT DELAWARE.
IF IT'S NOT WORKING, YOU HAVE TO END IT, IT'S GOT TO GO.
EXACTLY. SO LET'S DO THIS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE, SOUTH CAROLINA IS TAKING WAY MORE IN  GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAN THEY ARE PAYING BACK IN TAX.
THAT'S NOT GOOD IS IT.
YOU'RE IN THE RED.
YEAH.
SO WHAT DO WE DO.
CUT GOVERNMENT EXPENSES, WHY DON'T WE TRY THAT.
SO ARE YOU BLAMING THE BOSS.

I'M LOOKING AT YOUR NUMBERS, THEY ARE MIDDLING, I KNOW YOU ARE WYOMING, NO ONE REALLY EXPECTS ANYTHING OF YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YEAH.
WOULD YOU LIKE A GATORADE, A TOWEL OR SOMETHING T SEEMS LIKE YOUR WHOLE FACE IS CRYING. THESE KIND OF THINGS ARE NEVER EASY, OKAY, CAN BE PAINFUL.
WE DECIDED TO LET GEORGIA GO.
SUDDENLY WHEN ACTUALLY FACED WITH THE NUMBERS, RUNNING AMERICA LIKE A BUSINESS DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL. AND IT WAS EVERY STATE FOR THEMSELVES.
YOU'RE REALLY IN THE RED AND WE CAN'T SUPPORT YOU.
NO, NO, IOWA IS-- HAS A BUDGET THAT SHOWS IN THE BLACK.
