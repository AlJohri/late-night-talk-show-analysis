COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A PROGRAM TONIGHT. THE DIRECTOR RON HOWARD WILL BE JOINING US LATER ON IN THE PROGRAM. FIRST LET'S GET TO THE TOP STORY. IT'S BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE THE TERRIBLE EVENTS IN TUCSON, ARIZONA, AND LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PAID HIS RESPECTS SPEAKING TO AN  AUDIENCE OF THOUSANDS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. THE PRESIDENT PLAYED THE ROLE OF MOURNER IN CHIEF.
OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN BY THEIR SUDDEN PASSING. OUR HEARTS ARE|ï¿½ï¿½r BROKEN.
Jon: THE PRESIDENT PLAYED THE ROLE OF CONSOLER IN CHIEF.
GABBY OPENED HER EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GABBY OPENED HER EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: AND THE PRESIDENT PLAYED THE ROLE OF INSPIRER IN CHIEF.
IF THIS TRAGEDY PROMPTS REFLECTION AND DEBATE, AS IT  SHOULD, LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S WORTHY OF THOSE WE HAVE LOST. [  APPLAUSE  ] LET'S MAKE SURE IT'S NOT ON THE USUAL PLANE OF POLITICS AND  POINT SCORING AND PETTINESS THAT DRIFTS AWAY IN THE NEXT NEWS CYCLE.
Jon: IT WAS A MESSAGE NOT LOST ON THE PURVEYORS THE OF THE NEXT NEWS CYCLE WHO ACROSS  POLITICAL LINES PRAISED THE SPEECH FOR NEARLY TWO TO THREE MINUTES BEFORE ALLOWING  POLITICS, POINT SCORING AND PETTINESS TO KICK OFF THE REUNION TOUR.
WE SAW BARACK OBAMA AT HIS FINEST.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID A WONDERFUL JOB.
I THOUGHT THE SPEECH WAS PARTICULARLY COURAGEOUS.
DO YOU HAVE TO QUESTION THE TIMING OF IT.
Jon: NO,|ï¿½|ï¿½ NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE NOT A PRIMITIVE PEOPLE CAPABLE ONLY OF RESPONSE TO OUTSIDE STIMULI. YOU HAVE A CHOICE YOU WENT TO OBERLIN. ONCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE PRESIDENT SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED A HEALTHY INFUSION OF SUPPORT, INSPIRATION AND COMFORT TO A COMMUNITY IN DIRE NEED THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO DO TO WONDER  ABOUT THE SEATING ARRANGEMENT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THEY DIDN'T PUT THE PEOPLE THAT  TACKLED THE SHOOTER WHY WEREN'T THEY IN THE FIRST TWO ROWS.
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD THEM IN THE FRONT ROW.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT MUCH BETTER. THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT A BETTER SHOW. IT'S A MEMORIAL SERVICE, NOT THE EMMYS. [LAUGHTER] EVEN THE BLESSING BY DR. CAR LOGE GONZALEZ A MEMBER OF THE U OF A FACULTY AND THE YAQUI TRIBE.
I COME TO GIVE A BLESSING.
THE NATIVE AMERICAN WHO OPENED UP THE SHOW WHICH I FOUND VERY STRANGE.
Jon: IT'S NOT A SHOW! [LAUGHTER] HE DIDN'T OPEN UP A SHOW! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S MOURNING WITH A U. YOU ARE CONFUSING A MORNING SHOW WHICH YOU ARE ON WITH A SHOW OF MOURNING WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS. DIDN'T YOU WONDER WHY NO ONE THREW TO COMMERCIAL? VETERAN JOURNALIST BRIT HUME WAS MORE PERPLEXED.
REVEREND GONZALEZ BLESSED THE REPTILES OF SEA, PRAYED TO THE  FOUR DOORS OFjI'M SURE IT'S AN HONORABLE TRADITION WITH HIS PEOPLE IT WAS  MOST PA CUELLAR.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, I LIKE MY BENEDICTION LIKE I LIKE MY COFFEE, CHRISTIAN. [LAUGHTER] I HAVE TO SAY, I ALSO THINK THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA MADE A DIRE MISTAKE AFTERWARDS EATING  SANDWICHES AND A CORN PANCAKE INSTEAD OF ON A MORE AMERICAN SLICE OF BREAD. [LAUGHTER] BUT IF THERE WAS ONE THING EVERYONE AGREED ON IT WAS THAT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE AUDIENCE. [BLEEPED] IT UP FOR EVERYONE.
THE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE AT A PEP RALLY.
THE AUDIENCE, MOSTLY STUDENTS WAS REACTING WITH CHEERS ANDï¿½ï¿½ï¿½i  YELLS IN WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SOLEMN MEMORIAL.
IT TURNED INTO A PEP RALLY.
YOU CAN EITHER HAVE A PEP RALLY OR A MEMORIAL SERVICE. YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AN IRISH WAKE? I HAVE NEVER BEEN SADDER AND LAUGHED HARDER IN MY LIFE. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU GUYS:  AMEN AIN'T THAT FAR FROM WOOHOO. FOR MORE ON THE TUCSON MEMORIAL SERVICE WE GO TO SAMANTHA BEE AND JOHNER HAVE. THANK YOU -- JOHNER HAVE. I -- JOHN OLIVER. I WAS TOUCHED. IT SEEMED LIKE WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDED. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE CRITICISM OF THE CROWD AT A MEMORIAL SERVICE?
I THINK IT WAS ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE, JON. WE UNTRUSTED TUCSON WITH GIVING A -- ENTRUSTED TUCSON WITH GIVING A VOICE TO OUR NATION'S  GRIEF AND BOY, DID THEY LET US DOWN.
JOHN OLIVER IS RIGHT THEY RUINED THE MEMORIAL SERVICE.
THEY WERE TERRIBLE. I PERSONALLY WAS OWE OFFENDED.
YOU KNOW WHAT, BROW BEATING THEM ISN'T THE ANSWER. THEY NEED CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.
Jon: YOU ARE GIVING NOTES TO MOURNERS.
IN MY BUSINESS WE SAY WE'RE HELPING THEM WITH THE OPTICS. MAY I? WHY DON'T WE START WITH THAT STUPID ORANGE FLAG ON THE STAGE. HELLO, TACKY. [LAUGHTER] NO, NO.
Jon: THAT'S THE STATE FLAG OF ARIZONA.
OKAY. BUT IT'S INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NATIONAL AUDIENCE.
ABSOLUTELY, SAM. TAOUS TAOUS TIEW THEY MADE IT ABOUT THEMSELVES. I HAVEN'T CHECKED TUCSON'S APPROVAL NUMBER BUT I BET THE NEGATIVES ARE WAY UP. WAY UP.
IT'S AN EASY FIX. NEXT TIME YOU SUFFER A SHOCKING$ï¿½ï¿½r UNEXPECTED TRAGEDY REMEMBER A FEW PIECES OF BLACK CREPE CHANGE  THE WHOLE MOOD.
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
Jon: WHAT IS THIS OVER HERE
NONE OTHER THAN SIR ELTON JOHN. NO ONE PERSONALIZES A SAD SONG TO YOUR TRAGIC EVENT LIKE THIS 70s HIT MAKER.
THAT WAS GREAT BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE  DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO PUBLICLY GRIEVE TO OUR EXPECTATIONS. >>S THEY A GREAT QUESTION, JOHN. THAT'S WHY I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF REPLACING THE PEOPLE OF TUCSON WITH ITALIAN WIDOWS.
GREAT CHOICE.
THANK YOU.
SUCH A GREAT CHOICE, SAM.
THANK YOU.
SUCH A GREAT CHOICE. THOSE WOMEN KNOW HOW TO WAIL.
Jon: THIS IS TERRIBLE. WE WEREN'T THERE. WE DON'T KNOW THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS EVENT TOOK PLACE. THE GROVE AND CATHARSIS ARE NOT UNIVERSAL IN HOW THEY ARE EXPRESSED. YOU ARE FOCUSING ON THE WRONG THINGS. I'M APPALLED THE YOU AND -- AT YOU AND THE WAY IT'S BEEN|ï¿½ DISSECTED. I'M SORRY.
WHOA WHOA WHOA, OKAY.
OKAY.
YOU MADE YOUR POINT. MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT. MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT. INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT THE OPT ICS AND THE SUPERFICIALALITIES WE SHOULD BE  FOCUSING ON HOW THIS EFFECTS THE 2012 ELECTRIC.
THIS HAS TO GIVE A HUGE BOOST TO HUCKABEE'S CHANCES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
