(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED "GRAY."
WHAT WAS THAT?
IT WENT AT HIM. HE PUT A DART... WHATEVER THAT CHALLENGE WAS, HE ALSO PUT A DART.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS?
WE KILL HIM. ONE AT A TIME. TIP THE NUMBERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO US. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM LIAM NEESON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I LIKE TO STAND VERY FAR AWAY TO HEIGHTEN THE DISPARITY BETWEEN OUR RELATIVE SIZES.
OH, SIT DOWN.
Jon: I LOOK LIKE SPROUT. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M OKAY, JOHN, YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: I AM ALL FOR ACTORS DOING THEIR OWN STUNTS, DOING THESE THINGS. THIS LOOKS LIKE THEY ACTUALLY PUT YOU INTO THE VERY FROZEN AND DESOLATE AREA.
IT WAS COLD, JON, IT WAS COLD.
Jon: WHERE ARE YOU FILMING THIS?
WE WERE UP IN... FOR A WEEK AND A HALF UP IN A PLACE CALLED SMITHERS UP IN NORTHERN  SUBARCTIC BRITISH COLUMBIA. (ONE AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERS).
Jon: NO, NO.
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, EITHER.
Jon: NOBODY HERE FROM SMITHERS. (LAUGHTER) THAT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE TOWNS THAT IS NAMED AFTER THE  PERSON WHO DIED TRYING TO GET THERE. (LAUGHTER)
MAYBE. YOU KNOW, IT'S A POPULATION OF 5,000. BEAUTIFUL LITTLE VILLAGE. IN THREE FEET OF SNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THE SPRING. BUT IT'S GOT A GREAT SUSHI RESTAURANT. A GREAT PIZZA RESTAURANT. ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANTS I'VE EVER BEEN IN. GO FIGURE.
Jon: THAT I CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE THE FISH THERE IS REMARKABLY FRESH. OR DO THEY SHIP IT IN?
I THINK IT WAS CAUGHT.
Jon: IN THIS TOWN OF 5,000, HOW DID THEY REACT TO THE PRESENCE OF EIGHT MOVIE STARS AND A FILM SET? WERE YOU A CURIOSITY IN THE TOWN? WHERE THERE A RISE IN, LET'S SAY, SAYS SCWAWCH SIGHTINGS.
WELL, I WASN'T ME.
Jon: WE'RE A LARGE MAN. HOW DID THEY REACT TO YOU GUYS COMING TO TOWN?
THEY WERE VERY SWEET, VERY HELPFUL. AND WE WERE SHOOTING UP THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN. ALL THE WEATHER CONDITIONS YOU SEE IN THE MOVIE. THERE'S NO C.G.I . IT'S ALL REAL. SNOW, REAL SLEET. REAL WIND. SO AT TIMES...
Jon: THEY GOT THEIR SLEET.
SO THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THEY SAID "YOU'VE GOT TO GET OFF THE  MOUNTAIN, THE WIND'S COMING IN." AND WE'D GO "NO, TRUST US."  SO THERE WERE TIMES COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN IT WAS WHITES YOU. IT WAS QUITE DANGEROUS.
Jon: AND YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF NEXT TIME WE LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)
THE LOCALS KNOW. NEXT TIME WE DO IN THE A TAHITI.
Jon: NOT AS MANY WOLVES, UNFORTUNATELY. IS THERE EVER A MOMENT... THE STORY IS ABOUT A PLAIN THAT CRASHES AND THESE MEN TRYING TO  SURVIVE IN THE WILDERNESS.
THE PLANE MALL FUNCTIONS.
Jon: CRASH, OBVIOUSLY YOU AND I PILOTS BOTH. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, SURE.
Jon: WAS THERE EVER A MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE GOING THERE  AND YOU'RE THINKING "LOOK AT US, FLYING TO A REMOTE FROZEN REGION GOING TO A MOVIE TO FILM ABOUT FLYING IN A REMOTE FROZEN  REGION." AND DID YOU EVER THINK TO YOURSELF "THIS IS GOING TO BE  THE MOST IRONIC OBITUARY?" (LAUGHTER)
THE DAY AFTER WE FINISHED IN SMITHERS, I'M TALKING TEMPERATURES MINUS 30, MINUS 37  THE FIRST FEW DAYS. THE DAY AFTER WE FINISHED IN THAT LOCATION WE WERE ALL FLYING OUT IN A CHARTER AIRPLANE, ALL  THE CREW, ALL THE CAST, AND WE'RE ALL SITTING THERE. (LAUGHTER)
(BLEEP).
Jon: THAT'S NERVE-WRACKING.
"TRAGEDY STRUCK HOLLYWOOD TODAY."
Jon: THE TOWNSPEOPLE, AS YOU WERE LEAVING WAS IT... LET'S SAY THE FALL OF SAIGON? WERE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR THE PLANE TO TRY AND GO WITH?
GIRLS AND...
Jon: PREGNANT GIRLS.
NOTHING LIKE THAT.
Jon: WHAT DOES THE INDUSTRY... IS IT A FISHING VILLAGE? WHAT IS THE INDUSTRY?
IT SEEMS TO BE TOURISM. A LOT OF FISHING.
Jon: I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID TOURISM? IT'S A TOURIST TOWN?
IT'S A TOURIST TOWN, YES.
Jon: SO YOU FLY INTO THIS DESOLATE REGION CALLED SMITHERS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA AND THE  FIRST THING YOU ENCOUNTER IS LIKE A T-SHIRT SHOP. (LAUGHTER)
THERE'S A FEW OF THEM.
Jon: IF I GO TO THE PIZZERIA IN SMITHERS HOW MANY PICTURES DO I SEE OF THE PIZZA  SHOP OWNERS WITH HIS ARM AROUND LIAM NEESON? (LAUGHTER)
THERE MIGHT BE TWO OR THREE.
Jon: THE WHOLE WALL IS JUST COVERED. LIAM NEESON EATING A SLICE.
SNOW GOOSE, YOU KNOW?
Jon: ANY FIRE... ANY FROZEN RELATED INJURIES?
OH, WE HAD... THERE WAS A COUPLE OF THE CAST, SOME OF THE CREW GOT FROSTBITE.
Jon: THEY'RE OUT THERE 16 HOURS WITH THE FILM AND CANISTERS.
NOT 16 HOURS. YOU COULDN'T DO IT, JON. BY THE TIME WE GOT UP THE MOUNTAIN WE HAD MAYBE FOUR AND A HALF HOURS OF FILMING BEFORE THE  SUN WENT DOWN.
Jon: YOU COULDN'T DO IT. (LAUGHTER) MY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MUCH THROUGH MUCH, MY FRIEND. (LAUGHTER) "THE GREY" I DON'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT HAPPENS. IT'S VERY... NO REAL WOLVES IN THE... IT'S... I MEAN THE REAL...
THERE WAS A COUPLE BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE C.G.I . IT WAS A LOT OF ANIMATRONICS.
Jon: IT LOOKS FOR REAL. BUT NOT FOR YOU.
OH, YEAH.
Jon: THERE'S A LIAM NEESON PUPPET, YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. "THE GREY" OPENS IN THEATERS JANUARY 27.
