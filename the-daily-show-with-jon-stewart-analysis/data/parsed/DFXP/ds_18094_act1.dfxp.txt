FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   JON WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. JON STEWART HERE. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE HAVE A  FINE PROGRAM LINED UP FOR YOU  TONIGHT FROM IRON MAN 3 ACTOR ROBERT DOWNEY II WILL BE JOINING  US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THEY ENJOY THE MOVIE STAR. BOY ARE THEY IN FOR A SEGWAY. WE BEGIN TONIGHT COMEDY PROGRAM  IN THE MIDDLE EAST. NO MORE. SYRIA! SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR IS NOW TWO  YEARS OLD. WHILE THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT  NECESSARILY TAKEN A FIRM OR  ACTIVE ROLE IN THE CONFLICT BECAUSE WE JUST FOUND OUT WHERE  SYRIA WAS -- IT'S NEXT TO  IRAQ -- THERE WAS ONE POTENTIAL ASSAD REGIME ATROCITY WE IN THE  UNITED STATES DEEMD NOTEWORTHY:  CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
A RED LINE FOR US IS WE START  SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF CHEMICAL  WEAPONS MOVING AROUND, THAT'S A RED LINE FOR US. AND THAT THERE WOULD BE ENORMOUS  CONSEQUENCES.
Jon: BIG-TIME CONSEQUENCES. YOU CAN COME UP TO THE LINE. YOUR BOMBING, YOUR MORTAR  SHELLS. YOUR GENERAL MACHINE GUNNING. YOUR CLUSTER BOMBS. YOU CROSS THAT LINE, MISTER, YOU  ARE GROUNDED. GUESS WHAT.
THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY ASSESSES WITH SOME  DEGREE OF VARYING CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS USED  CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A SMALL  SCALE IN SYRIA.
Jon: YOU DONE [BLEEP] NOW. YOU HAVE CROSSED THE RED LINE. AND BY THE WAY, WHERE IS DEFENSE  SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL? WHOSE BLAZER IS HE BORROWING? AND WHY DOES HE KEEP LOOKING  DOWN? CAN WE SEE WHAT THAT GUY IS  LOOKING AT... OH, HE'S ORDERING. OH, I DIDN'T... ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I DIDN'T REALIZE. MORE IMPORTANTLY NOW THAT WE  KNOW THAT THE RED LINE HAS BEEN  CROSSED AND THE RED LINE HAS BEEN CROSSED, WHAT NEXT?
WE STILL HAVE SOME  UNCERTAINTIES.
WE ARE WORKING TO ESTABLISH  CREDIBLE AND CORROBORATED FACTS  AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESIDENT'S RED LINE HAS BEEN  CROSSED.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE  USED, WHEN THEY WERE USED, WHO  USED THEM.
Jon: FOR INSTANCE, DID HE USE  THEM IN A BOAT? DID HE USE THEM IN A BOAT? DID HE USE THEM IN A HOUSE? DID HE USE THEM WITH A MOUSE? IT'S FROM OBAMA'S NEW BOOK "RED  LINES AND GAS."  LOOK, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT  EVERYONE IS SATISFIED WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH.
ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE  APPROACH THE ADMINISTRATION IS  TAKING?
NO. I HAVEN'T BEEN SATISFIED FOR A  LONG TIME.
I HOPE THAT THIS NEW  REVELATION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS  WILL MOVE THE PRESIDENT TO DO WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TWO  YEARS AGO.
WE'VE GOT 70,000 DEAD PEOPLE  IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD AS A  RESULT OF ASSAD. WE AS AMERICA HAVE NEVER LET  SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN  BEFORE.
Jon: THANK YOU. WELL, OBVIOUSLY EXCEPT FOR  RWANDA AND DARFUR AND BOSNIA AND  CAMBODIA. POINT TAKEN. POINT TAKEN. WE AS AMERICA HAVE NEVER LET  SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN  BEFORE. IN SYRIA WITH THIS PARTICULAR  ASSAD. LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS. OBAMA IS DOING IT ALL WRONG. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? TIME TO ARM THE REBELS.
YES TO ARMING THE REBELS. THERE ARE MORE RADICAL ISLAMIC  FIGHTERS THERE. LET'S GIVE THE RIGHT WEAPONS TO  THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
Jon: RIGHT WEAPONS TO THE  RIGHT PEOPLE. AHH! MAYBE WE COULD DO BACKGROUND  CHECKS. NO, THAT WOULDN'T WORK. ALL RIGHT. SO THE PLAN IS NOW ARM THE  REBELS.
THERE'S TWO WARS TO FIGHT. ONE TO GET ASSAD OUT OF THERE. THE SECOND WAR UNFORTUNATELY IS  GOING TO BE BETWEEN THE MAJORITY  OF SYRIANS AND THE RADICAL ISLAM I HAVES WHO HAVE POURED INTO  SYRIA. WE NEED TO BE READY TO FIGHT TWO  WARS.
Jon: OKAY. SO TWO WARS. LET ME JUST ADD THAT UP QUICKLY  BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE ALREADY IN  TWO. SO, LET ME SEE. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR. WE HAVE FOUR WARS. THAT'S DO-ABLE. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WILL TAKE A LOT  OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND, HOWEVER.
YOU DON'T NEED BOOTS ON THE  GROUND.
WE DON'T NEED TO PUT BOOTS ON  THE GROUND.
THE WORST THING THE UNITED  STATES COULD DO RIGHT NOW IS PUT  BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
Jon: INTERESTING. SO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO ARM  THE REBELS, THE RIGHT REBELS, TO  TAKE DOWN ASSAD. ONCE ASSAD IS DOWN, ASK THE  REBELS FOR THE GUNS BACK SO THAT  THE REGULAR SYRIANS CAN HAVE THEIR COUNTRY BACK AND WE NEED  TO DO ALL THIS BY REMOTE FREEDOM  MAGIC.
YOU DON'T NEED BOOTS ON THE  GROUND FROM THE U.S. POINT OF  VIEW. BUT YOU SURE DO NEED  INTERNATIONAL ACTIONS TO BRING  THIS THING TO A CLOSE QUICKLY.
Jon: LATVIAN BOOTS ON THE  GROUND. GOT IT. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GO INTERNATIONAL BOOTS ON  THE GROUND. WHY HAVEN'T WE GONE TO THE U.N. ALREADY?
THEY NEED HARD EVIDENCE  CHIEFLY TO PERSUADE RUSSIA. RUSSIA IS SYRIA'S REMAINING ALLY  IN THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL. THEY HAVE TO PERSUADE RUSSIA  THAT THE ASSAD REGIME DID USE  DEADLY SARIN GAS AGAINST ITS OWN  PEOPLE.
Jon: WE ARE [BLEEP]. SO INTERVENTION IN SYRIA RELIES  ON THE UNITED STATES CONVINCING  VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT IT'S BAD TO POISON PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). YEAH, THAT WILL WORK. SARIN GAS, HMMM. YES, YES. I REMEMBER IT WELL. A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN  THE GOOD OLD DAYS, ISN'T IT,  FELLOWS? WHEN YOU COULD JUST INVADE A  COUNTRY. IT'S AS THOUGH THE MISADVENTURE  MADE US A LITTLE MORE CONSCIOUS  AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES THE CROSSING OF A RED LINE. EVEN THE RING LEADER THAT PROUD  CHAPTER IN BLACK-AND-WHITE NO  NUANCE AMERICAN POLICY HAS LEARNED TO SEE RED LINES WITH A  LITTLE MORE SHADING.
I'M SITTING HERE ANALYZING  THAT TIE YOU HAVE AND TRYING TO  FIGURE OUT IF I CAN MIX PAINT. A LITTLE PERMANENT ROSE AND  MAYBE A TOUCH OF WHITE. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE MAYBE A  LITTLE RAW UMBER TO DARKEN IT UP  SO IT CAN REFLECT THE LIGHT  PROPERLY.
Jon: YEAH. YOU DO
