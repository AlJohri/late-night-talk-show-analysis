[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME ONCE AGAIN FOR OUR BICENTENNIAL SEGMENT GOOD NEWS FROM AFGHANISTAN. â™ª  IN OUR LAST INSTALLMENT BACK IN THE EARLY OTS, MUSIC HAD JUST BEEN REALLOWED. SO WHAT IS EVERYONE SMILING ABOUT IN AFGHANISTAN THESE DAYS?
DESPITE THREATS FROM THE TALIBAN VOTERS IN AFGHANISTAN TURN OUT IN DROVES THIS WEEKEND TO ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT.
EARLIEST ESTIMATES PUT THE NUMBER AT SEVEN MILLION OUT OF 12 MILLION ELIGIBLE VOTERS NEARLY 60%.
Jon: 60% THAT IS ADORABLE. IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO OUR LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH WAS AH -- [LAUGHTER] -- 54.9%. WAIT THEY BEAT US? BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF THAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH FOR OUR ELECTIONS. NOVEMBER IS NOTORIOUS FOR THANKSGIVING PREP AND EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING AND OBVIOUSLY THE IN BETWEEN NATURE OF SEASON MAKES A CHOICE OF LIGHT JACKET OR WARMER JACKET MORE COMPLICATED. I ONLY ASSUME AFGHAN VOTERS HAD AN EASIER RIDE IN LATE MARCH OR EARLY APRIL. I MEAN IT'S THEIR SPRING BREAK FOR GOD'S SAKE.
IN JUST THE PAST WEEK, THE TALIBAN STAGED FOUR ATTACKS INCLUDING ONE ON THE ELECTION COMMISSION HEADQUARTERS.
Jon: AND?
THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION SAYS THERE WERE 140 ATTACKS OR ATTEMPTED ATTACKS AND ALMOST 1,000 POLLING STATIONS HAD TO BE CLOSED FOR SECURITY REASONS. ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX.
Jon: AND?
IN 2009 ABOUT 20% OF THE VOTES HAD TO BE DISCOUNTED BECAUSE THEY WERE CONSIDERED FRAUDULENT.
Jon: OKAY NOT THE IDEAL CONDITIONS I'M SURE 60% MOST OF THAT IS PROBABLY FRAUDULENT ANYWAY.
SO FAR WIDESPREAD ALLEGATIONS OF BALLOT STUFFING AND FRAUD HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED. PEOPLE HAVE UNTIL THE END OF TODAY TO REPORT COMPLAINTS, BY THE WAY. ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT SO FAR HAS TO SIMPLY DO WITH POLLING STATIONS RUNNING OUT OF BALLOTS.
Jon: NOT ONLY THAT BUT APPARENTLY THE FOX NEWS AFFILIATE IN KABUL REPORTED THAT A BLACK PANTHER WAS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE WHITE VOTERS OUTSIDE OF THE POLLING STATION. [LAUGHTER] WOW. SEVEN MILLION AFGHAN CITIZENS IGNORED DEATH THREATS FROM THE TALIBAN TO GET TO THE POLLS. I CANNOT IMAGINE THE GARGANTUAN BALLS THAT THESE GUYS MUST HAVE.
A THIRD OF THE VOTERS THAT LINED UP AT THE POLLING STATIONS YESTERDAY WERE WOMEN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU KNOW IT -- IT OCCURS TO ME WE NEED TO MAYBE COME UP WITH A BETTER TERM TO DESCRIBE BALLS THAN BALLS. LADY BALLS. [LAUGHTER] BALLETTES. ESTRICLES. ANYWAY, IT'S GREAT THE ELECTION WENT SO WELL IN THE FACE OF SO MANY ODDS BUT LET'S BE HONEST THEY ARE JUST GOING TO ELECT HAMID KARZAI'S PUPPET CANDIDATE. YOU KNOW HOW THESE THINGS WORK.
FORMER WORLD BANK EXECUTIVE ASHRAF GHANI AND OPPOSITION LEADER ABDULLAH ABDULLAH ARE SAID TO BE THE FRONT RUNNERS. THE CANDIDATE ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT PRESIDENT HAMID KARZAI IS BELIEVED TO BE FUTHER BACK LIMITING KARZAI'S INFLUENCE GOING FORWARD.
Jon: OH (bleep) NO YOU DIDN'T. KARZAI'S GOING TO BE SO MAD. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE CAT HE IS GOING TO PAINT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
