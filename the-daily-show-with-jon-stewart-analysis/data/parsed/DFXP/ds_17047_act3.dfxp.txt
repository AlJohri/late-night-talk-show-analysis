THIS LADY WAS RIGHT OUT THERE, UH-HUH.

Jon: FOURTH FLOOR SWINGING HIS BUSINESS.
YES, I HAVE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE HERE. I LIVED IN A BROWNSTONE ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE. AND THERE WAS A DUDE RIGHT ACROSS THE COURTYARD IN THE BACK. AND EVERY TIME IT WAS LIKE HONEY GET UP AND CLOSE THE WINDOW, IT WAS JUST  LIKE-- HE WOULD STAND ON THE PHONE WITH HIS JUNK JUST LIKE-- .
Jon: RIGHT.
ON THE PHONE IN THE WINDOW, LOOKING AROUND, AND NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD.
Jon: I ALWAYS THINK OF THAT, LIKE HE KNOWS. AND IT'S ALWAYS-- IT'S ALWAYS SO PROUD OF HIS BODY AND ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT MAYBE  SHOULDN'T BE QUITE AS PROUD.
