Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, GUN VIOLENCE IS RAMPART IN  AMERICA BUT ONLY NOW IS IT  BECOMING CLEAR HOW WIDESPREAD THE PROBLEM IS.
A FLORIDA MAN SHOT IN THE LEG  AND THE SHOOTER WAS NOT  ARRESTED. THE MATE BE CAUSE HE WAS SHOT IN  THE LEG BY HIS DOG. -- IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE MAN WAS  SHOT IN THE LEG BY HIS DOG.
Jon: OF COURSE IN FLORIDA  THE DOG CLAIMED HE WAS STANDING  HIS GROUND. A DOG SHOT A MAN AND GOT OFF  SCOTT FREE. I GUESS IT WAS A PURR-FECT. NO. THAT DOESN'T.
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS A  BAD GUY WITH A GUN IS IT A GOOD  GUY WITH A GUN.
Jon: SO IF WE EXTRAPOLATE  TO THIS CASE, I CAN ONLY ASSUME  THAT THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A BAD DOG WITH A GUN IS A GOOD DOG  WITH A GUN. WHO IS A GOOD BOY? [LAUGHTER] BUT EVEN THAT WON'T COMPLETELY  SOLVE THIS ISSUE.
COOKING BREAKFAST PROVES VERY  DANGEROUS FOR A FLORIDA WOMAN. SHE DECIDED TO PREHEAT A  FRIEND'S OVEN ON MONDAY SO SHE  COULD MAKE WAFFLES. LITTLE DID SHE KNOW THE FRIEND  WAS KEEPING GUN AMMO IN THE  STOVE. WHIT HEATED UP IT EXPLODED  SPRAYING THE WOMAN WITH BULLETS  AND CASING FRAGMENTS. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SHE WASN'T  SERIOUSLY INJURED. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHO IN THEIR RIGHT  MIND USING THEIR OVEN TO MAKE  WAFFLES? [LAUGHTER] WHY WOULDN'T YOU USE YOUR WAFFLE  IRON? [LAUGHTER] AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE YOUR  OVEN TO MAKE WAFFLES, WOULDN'T  YOU CHECK TO SEE IF THE OVEN WAS  LOADED? [LAUGHTER] FOLKS, IT'S CLEAR THIS PROBLEM  SOUGHT OF CONTROL. LAUGH RAV -- IT'S CLEAR THIS  PROBLEM IS OUT OF CONTROL. AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T HELP. BUT I KNOW ONE CRIME FIGHTING  DUO THAT HAPPEN TO BE PERFECTLY  SUITED TO PROTECT AMERICA FROM THIS SURGE IN DOGS AND APPLIANCE  VIOLENCE.
IN A CITY WHERE BAD DOGS AND  APPLIANCES ARE OUT OF CONTROL.
