[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LONGTIME UNIVISION ANCHOR. HIS NEW SHOW FOR FUSION IS CALLED AMERICA WITH JORGE RAMOS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JORGE RAMOS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SIT, SIT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? MR. RAMOS --
MR. STEWART.
Jon: THE AMOUNT OF WORK YOU DO. YOU ARE ANCHORING FOR UNIVISION.
FOR UNIVISION.
Jon: RUN ME THROUGH THE VARIOUS JOBS YOU HAVE TO --
I HAVE TO DO THE "DAILY NEWS"CAST IN SPANISH FOR UNIVISION WHICH IS EXPANDING. WE'RE THE MOST WATCHED NETWORK RECENTLY. IN SPANISH EVERY DAY FROM 6:30 TO 7. AT NIGHT I DO FUSION A NEW SHOW CALLED AMERICA. IT'S A NETWORK, NEWS AND ENTERTAINMENT, YOUNG VIEWERS.
Jon: IN SPANISH AS WELL OR ENGLISH?
IT'S ENGLISH ON FUSION. SUNDAY MORNING POLITICAL SHOW IN SPANISH AND BILINGUAL COLUMN FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SYNDICATE. I'M AN IMMIGRANT I NEED A LOT OF JOBS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: EXACTLY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE MORE STANDARD AMERICAN NEWS ANCHORS BUT BRIAN WILLIAMS, AND I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. SHOWS UP AT 5:00 PRETTY DRUNK.
SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: READS FROM THE TELEPROMPTER AND BASICALLY SPENDS REST OF HIS NIGHT IN A BROTHEL.
ARE YOU SURE?
Jon: ALMOST POSITIVE.
WE HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT.
Jon: PROBABLY HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT. KIND OF AN INCREDIBLE TIME. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN AT UNIVISION?
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR UNIVISION FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS NOW.
Jon: WHAT IS THE CHANGE THAT YOU'VE SEEN? HERE YOU ARE YOU'VE EARNED THIS AUTHORITY AND GRAVITAS IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT WATCHES UNIVISION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 30 YEARS LATER YOU FIND THAT YOU ARE IN THE MOST RELEVANT, FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC AND POLITICAL VOICE IN THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW.
IT HAS CHANGED. WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1983 THERE WERE ONLY 15 MILLION LATINOS. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 55 MILLION LATINOS. AS YOU KNOW WE LOVE TO MAKE BABIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH WE HAVE A LOT OF BABIES SO THAT MEANS IN --
Jon: THAT'S NICE. [LAUGHTER]
IN 35 YEARS THERE'S GOING TO BE 150 MILLION LATINOS. EVERYTHING IS CHANGING BECAUSE OF THAT. MORE TORTILLAS SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY THAN HAMBURGER BUNS.
Jon: I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DOING MY MATERIAL BACK AT ME. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, NO, NO.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT I SHOULD BE SAYING TO YOU.
THE MOST POPULAR NAMES IS NO LONGER JOHN OR STEVEN. IT'S JOSE, OF COURSE. THE NEW RULES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT A HISPANIC VOTE AND HOPEFULLY WE HAVE OUR FIRST HISPANIC PRESIDENTE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHERE DO YOU SEE, AS YOU LOOK IN THE LANDSCAPE THEN, IS THERE SOMEONE WHO IS HISPANIC LATINO THAT YOU POINT TO AND GO THAT IS THE STANDARD BEARER, THAT'S THE GUY AND IS IT YOU?
NO I THINK IT'S SONIA SOTOMAYOR.
Jon: REALLY? YOU SEE HER AS HAVING A POLITICAL, SHE SHOULD -- THE SUPREME COURT DID.
SHE'S THE EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO DANCE WITH ANTONIN SCALIA BUT I HAD A CHANCE TO DANCE SALSA WITH HER. SHE'S FANTASTIC. SHE REPRESENTS THE BEST OF HISPANIC COMMUNITY.
Jon: RIGHT AND YOU FEEL LIKE IS THERE SOMEONE IN THE POLITICAL WORLD. SHE COMING FROM MORE OF AN ACADEMIC AND --
SHE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO -- HOWEVER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE HAVE MANY NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE THE FIRST PRESIDENTE. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE YOU HAVE SENATOR TED CRUZ OR MARCO RUBIO.
Jon: WHO ELSE YOU GOT? [LAUGHTER]
WELL, ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE YOU HAVE ANTONIO THE FORMER MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRST HISPANIC PRESIDENT. THAT'S A HUGE CHANGE. NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF NUMBERS BUT BECAUSE OF NEW POLITICAL POWER.
Jon: HAVE YOU FELT A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT OUR POLITICAL PROCESS ENGAGES YOU? HAVE YOU SEEN OUR -- ARE PEOPLE -- DO YOU FIND THEM PATRONIZING YOU? IN THE WAY THAT OHIO IS NOW A SWING STATE SO EVERY FOUR YEARS THEY GO TO OHIO IN DROVES AND RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER THEY RUN AWAY AND COME BACK FOUR YEARS LATER. IS THAT THE FEAR OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY AS WELL?
THEY PAY MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO US. REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW SPEAKER BOEHNER AND MANY REPUBLICANS THINK THEY CAN HIDE AND THEY CAN DO POLITCALLY EXPEDIENT THINGS LIKE NOT PUTTING IMMIGRATION REFORM TO A VOTE BUT LATINOS REMEMBER THAT.
Jon: IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM, GET IN LINE BECAUSE WE WERE HERE FIRST AND WE'RE STILL MAD AT HIM ABOUT A BUNCH OF  OTHER STUFF.
REPUBLICANS HAVE A PROBLEM. IF THEY DON'T PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM THEY CAN SAY ADIOS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016.
Jon: DO THEY REALIZE THAT?
THE NEW RULE IN POLITICS IF YOU DON'T WIN AT LEAST A THIRD OF HISPANIC VOTE YOU LOSE THE WHITE HOUSE. GEORGE W. BUSH GOT THAT. HE WAS THE FIRST UNITED STATES PRESIDENT WHO THOUGHT THAT HE SPOKE SPANISH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT HELPED HIM. HE GOT 44% OF THE HISPANIC VOTE AND THEN WENT DOWN TO 31% WITH McCAIN AND 27% WITH ROMNEY WHO THOUGHT THAT PROMOTING SELF DEPORTATION WAS GOING TO GET HIM THE HISPANIC VOTE. IT WASN'T THAT WAY. NOW, I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DEMOCRATS IN THAT SENSE. PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED IMMIGRATION REFORM. HE DIDN'T KEEP THAT PROMISE.
Jon: DIDN'T KEEP HIS PROMISE, HUH?
HE IS DOING WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. HIS MESSAGE IS TRULY CONTRADICTORY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I FEEL LIKE SAYING FINALLY TO YOU GUYS WELCOME TO AMERICA. [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT. WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT IT. WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT? WE'LL TALK ABOUT DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM THAT SIDE OF AISLE. FAMERICA WITH JORGE RAMOS AIRS WEEKNIGHTS 8PM ON FUSION.
