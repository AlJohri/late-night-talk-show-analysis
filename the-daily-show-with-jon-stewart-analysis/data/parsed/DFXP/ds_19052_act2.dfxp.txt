Jon: SO UH, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:   IF YOU HAVE A GOOGLE ALERT FOR GOOGLE YOU MAY HAVE READ THAT GOOGLE IS IN A LITTLE BIT OF HOT WATER THESE DAYS.
GOOGLE IS UNDER FIRE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
GOOGLE IS ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT RUN A FLEET OF PRIVATE BUSES CARRYING WORKERS EVERY MORNING TO SILICON VALLEY 40 MILES AWAY.
A GOOGLE COMMUTER BUS WAS BLOCKED FOR A HALF HOUR YESTERDAY. PROTESTERS CHANTED AS THEY SURROUNDED THE BUS AND HELD UP SIGNS. "GOOGLE SCUM," READ ONE NOTICE.
Jon: TAKE THAT YOU, YOU CARPOOLING SCUM. HOW DARE YOU ENJOY THE LUXURY OF A BUS? [LAUGHTER] THIS REALLY ISN'T ABOUT THE BUSES, IS IT?
THIS SEEMS TO BE ABOUT MORE THAN SHUTTLE BUSES.
OF COURSE, IT IS. OF COURSE IT IS.
THE PRIVATE BUSES HAVE BECOME SYMBOLS OF INCOME INEQUALITY AND THE BELIEF THAT WELL PAID TECH WORKERS ARE TO BLAME FOR STEEPLY RISING RENTS.
Jon: AS VLADIMIR LENIN ALWAYS SAID WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE AND SURROUND THOSE OTHER WORKERS' BUS. I THINK THE ANGER IS MISPLACED HERE. YOU ARE LIKE THE GUY SCREAMING AT THE CAR RENTAL AGENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A (bleep) FULL TANK OF GAS BEFORE YOU GO OUT LIKE ANGIE MADE THE GAS POLICY. BUT IT'S NOT ANGIE IT WAS TROY. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE'S WHAT I THINK: THIS WHOLE BUS THING IS A RUSE BY GOOGLE SO PEOPLE DON'T FOCUS ON THE MUCH WEIRDER [BLEEP] THEY ARE DOING.
THE APP APPROPRIATELY NAMED, "SEX WITH GOOGLE GLASS" ALLOWS COUPLES TO WATCH AND RECORD SEXUAL ACTS AND SWITCH VIDEO FEEDS SO THEIR PARTNER CAN WATCH FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: FINALLY GOOGLE GLASS HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO GO (bleep)  YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I REALLY -- WHO HONESTLY WANTS TO HAVE SEX FROM THEIR PARTNER'S POINT OF VIEW? THE ONE THING THAT COULD DRIVE ME AWAY FROM SEX PERMANENTLY IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW I LOOK WHEN I'M DOING IT. CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHAT MY O FACE LOOKS LIKE. [LAUGHTER] TWO WORDS: CONSTIPATED BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY, ENJOY YOUR SLEEP. [ LAUGHTER ] GOOGLE GLASSES, IT'S CREEPY.  UNLESS YOU CAN MAKE SOME MONEY OFF IT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD THING TO PUT THAT ON A LITTLE DEVICE ON YOUR EYE PIECE.
BUT IT'S ANOTHER REMINDER OF JUST BIT BY BIT HOW GOOGLE SORT OF IMMERSES ITSELF IN OUR WORLD, YOU KNOW?
I THINK IT'S A GENIUS MOVE. WE OWN THE STOCK HERE. AND I THINK THE GOOGLE GLASS IS ONE THING THAT IS GOING TO TAKE THE STOCK EVEN HIGHER.
Jon: WHAT? YOU KNOW, CAVUTO IT'S A DISGUSTING ORWELLIAN INTRUSION INTO THE MOST INTIMATE MOMENT TWO PEOPLE CAN SHARE. I'D CATEGORIZE IT AS A BUY. [LAUGHTER] SO IT'S A SUPER ICKY NIGHTMARE MACHINE THAT GIVES YOU A CLOSE-UP OF YOUR OWN O FACE BUT AT LEAST IT'S USER FRIENDLY.
ALL GOOGLE GLASS USERS HAVE TO SAY IS, "OKAY, GLASS IT'S TIME" AND THE APP STARTS RECORDING. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO OKAY, GLASS, PULL OUT TO STOP. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SAY AFTER SEX. EVERYONE KNOWS WHEN YOU ARE FILMING THE SEX ACT WHEN IT'S OVER YOU YELL, "AND, CHECK THE GATE." THAT'S A WRAP FOR MY PENIS ON THIS PROJECT. MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE THAT CONDOM WITH WARDROBE.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
