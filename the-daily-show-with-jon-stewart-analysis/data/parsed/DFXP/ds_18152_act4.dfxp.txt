ALL RIGHT. WE ALWAYS-- EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS LET'S GETS BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. IN WHAT UNIVERSE HAS BIG MONEY EVER BEEN OUT OF POLITICS FROM THE HISTORY OF MAN, THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MOST CONTROL THE LEVERS OF POWER. THAT SEEMS LIKE A UTOPIAN IDEAL THAT WILL NEVER OCCUR. BUT CAN'T WE PUT SAFETY INTO THE SYSTEM FOR THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE IT?
WELL, IT'S A UTOPIAN IDEAL IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE IDEAL IS TO GET MONEY, BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS FOREVER. BUT IF YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT, LOOK AT McCAIN-FEINGOLD. WE GOT A LOT OF BIG MONEY OUT FOR ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROGRESSIVE, EARLY PROGRESSIVE REFORMS THAT GOT BIG MONEY OUT OF POLITICS FOR 8, 9, TEN YEARS. IT'S A CONSCIOUS FIGHT, IT IS A CONSTANT FIGHT AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING.
Jon: I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO VIEW IT IN THAT MANNER. ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS IS IF SOMETHING ISN'T GOING TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY, THEN IT FEELS AS THOUGH IT'S NOT WORTH DOING. AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IS YOU HAVE A HUGE CHUNK OF PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT NOW, WHO HAVE A VERY EASY JOB, WHICH IS THEY SAY GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK. GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HELP PEOPLE. AND JUST TO MAKE SURE OF IT, I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY SUGGESTION OR PROGRAM THAT THEY CREATE I CAN SABOTAGE AND SUBVERT AND THEN POINT TO THAT PROGRAM'S FAILURE AS MORE EVIDENCE OF MY PREVIOUS THEORY THAT GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WORK.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Jon: SO IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THAT, THEN OF COURSE THERE WILL BE NO LEGISLATIVE --
AND IF YOU CONVINCE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACTIVIST THAT THERE IS NO HOPE, THAT THEY, THEY OUGHT TO BE CYNICAL BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS JUST CRAP.
Jon: UH-HUH.
WELL, THEN YOU ARE CREATING SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY BECAUSE IF PEOPLE GIVE UP ON POLITICS, FIGURING THEY ARE GIVING UP ON DEMOCRACY WHICH IS THE APPLIED FORM OF POLITICS AND IF THEY GIVE UP ON DEMOCRACY --  THEY ARE CEDING THE ENTIRE GAME TO THE BIG VESTED INTEREST, THE MONEYED INTEREST, THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE USING POLITICS RIGHT NOW TO ENTRENCH THEIR OWN SELF AND THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST.
Jon: I AM GOING TO THROW SOMETHING OUT HERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS. THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF A RADICAL IDEA. SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN USED OR AT LEAST FLOATED IN AFRICA. IT'S A WAY AS A BULWARK AGAINST CORRUPTION. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TO SOME OF THE STRONGMEN IN AFRICA IS RUN YOUR COUNTRY AND REACH A CERTAIN METRIC IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE MONEY THAT IS GIVEN TO YOU, OR THAT YOU RAISE IN YOUR COUNTRY THAT GETS TO THE PEOPLE, AND DIMINISH CORRUPTION. AND THERE IS A PILE OF MONEY WAITING FOR YOU WHEN YOU'RE DONE. THERE'S A --
YOU INCENTIVIZE-- .
Jon: CORRECT.
NONCORRUPTION.
Jon: CORRECT.
YOU CORRUPT PEOPLE WITH NONCORRUPTION.
Jon: CORRECT, YEAH, YOU CORRUPT THEM WITH NON-- HERE'S THE THING. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. THEY WANT THAT CASH.
THEY WANT MONEY.
Jon: RIGHT. SO SAY IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING FOR FIVE YEARS, HERE'S SOME MONEY. WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR CONGRESS PEOPLE.
WELL, THEY ALREADY HAVE IT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO,. BUT THEY HAVE IT AS LOBBYISTS TO GO BACK INTO THE GOVERNMENT TO CORRODE IT FROM THE INSIDE OUT. WHAT IF WE SAID INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TAKE WHATEVER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM WHATEVER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, WHATEVER, IS GOING TO PAY TO LOBBY, WE SET UP A FUND THAT IF YOU SERVE FOR FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS WITH DISTINCTION FOR THE PEOPLE, THERE IS MONEY WAITING FOR YOU THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE FROM SHITHEADS. (APPLAUSE) WHAT ABOUT THAT?
IN OTHER WORDS,.
Jon: WE INCENTIVIZE THEM.
IT'S A BE RESPONSIBLE THE WAY YOU SHOULD BE FUND AND-- .
Jon: IT'S PAY PEOPLE TO ACT LIKE THEY SHOULD BE ACTING ON OUR BEHALF RATHER THAN USING THEIR CONGRESSIONAL --
BUT WHY SHOULDN'T PEOPLE BE ACTING ON OUR BEHALF THE WAY THEY OUGHT TO BE DOING IT ANYWAY. WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY THEM TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF.
Jon: BUT-- LISTEN, TINKER BELL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE REAL WORLD. BECAUSE THAT HASN'T WORKED. LOOK IT, THERE'S TOO MUCH OUT THERE FOR THAT.
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, JON, BUT I'LL TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, I WAS AN INTERN, YOU TALK ABOUT INTERNS BEFORE ON THE SHOW, FOR ROBERT KENNEDY IN 1967.
Jon: HOW AMAZING-- CAN I JUST STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. HE'S MY IDOL, HE'S MY IDOL IN POLITICAL TIMES AND MORAL TIMES, WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
IT WAS FABULOUS. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. IT WAS WHERE I GOT MY IDEALISM FROM. I MEAN IF YOU-- WE HAD GIANTS WALKING IN THIS COUNTRY, MARTIN LUTHER KING, ROBERT KENNEDY. WE HAD PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY CARED ABOUT THE PUBLIC INTEREST BUT WERE WILLING TO GIVE IT ALL, ULTIMATELY, SADLY, TRAGICALLY THEY DID GIVE IT ALL. BUT WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THAT NOW? WHY CAN'T WE EXPECT OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS TO BE TRULY GREAT.
Jon: DO WE ALLOW THAT, UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT AND THE GLARE THAT THEY FACE NOW, WOULD OUR GIANTS HAVE BEEN GIANTS. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT WEB SITES AND THINGS AND SHITHEADS LIKE ME. YOU GOT ALL THIS STUFF GOING AT THEM AT ALL TIMES, WOULD THEY BE THE GIANTS WE REMEMBER THEM AS?
WELL, IT'S INTERESTING QUESTION. I MEAN THE 24/7 NEWS CYCLE AND THE KIND OF GOTCHA JOURNALISM DOES CUT EVERYBODY DOWN TO SIZE. BUT I DO THINK THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY HATES THE KIND OF ANTAGONISM, VITRIOL, PARTISANSHIP THE PUBLIC IS ALSO DESPERATE FOR PEOPLE WITH INTEGRITY.
Jon: BUT THERE WAS A MORAL CLARITY TO THOSE TIMES THAT I FEEL LIKE WE DON'T HAVE. AND I'M NOT A GLASSY EYED NOSTALGIST. I DON'T THINK BACK LIKE THE '60s MAN, THAT IS WHERE IT WAS IT.
IT WAS A TERRIBLE TIME IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: AND THE DIVISION. I GOT SOME CLARITY OVERSEAS A LITTLE BIT. AND I CAN'T PRETEND THAT BEING IMMERSED IN THE CULTURE OF THEMIDDLE EAST FOR TWO MONTHS IS A REAL EDUCATION IN THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, IN THE SENSE OF IN THIS COUNTRY WE PLAY UP THE DIVIDE. THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY. SOME PEOPLE WATCH DUCK DYNASTY BUT OTHER PEOPLE WATCH JERSEY SHORE, YOU KNOW. IN THOSE COUNTRIES THEY'RE GRAPPLING WITH THINGS LIKE SOME PEOPLE THINK WOMEN SHOULD BE KILLED IF THEY CHEAT ON THEIR HUSBANDS, YOU KNOW. THAT'S A DIVIDE. WE'VE ANSWERED IN THIS COUNTRY A LOT OF THE REALLY BIG QUESTIONS. AND MAYBE WE SHOULD ALSO GET SOME PERSPECTIVE.
BUT I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IN THE 1960s, THAT CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE, THAT WAS A HUGE DIVIDE. GO BACK TO THE 50s, JOE McCARTHY AND HIS COMMUNIST WITCH-HUNTS OR THE VIETNAM WAR, WHICH I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY AND REMEMBER PEOPLE, FAMILIES SPLIT. THOSE WERE ERAS WHEN WE HAD BIG DIVIDES. RIGHT NOW, COME ON. I MEAN WE HAVE PARTISANSHIP, WE HAVE VITRIOL BUT THE THINGS THAT DIVIDE US ARE SO MUCH SMALLER. I THINK THE VITRIOL, HONESTLY, JON, COMES FROM SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO GET AHEAD, WORKING SO HARD, GETTING NOWHERE. THEY ARE ANGRY, FRUSTRATED. AND THEY ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEMAGOGUES.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK SOME OF THE VITRIOL ALSO RELATES TO THE IDEA THAT THAT IS WHAT SELLS IN THIS TIME? THAT CONFLICT IS A WONDERFUL MOTIVATOR FOR RATINGS AND CABLE AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AND THAT ENDS UP BEING REFLECTED IN THE ATTITUDES AND MENTALITY OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THEN BELIEVE WE'RE MAYBE A LITTLE MORE DIVIDED THAT THAN WE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE.
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I WAS ON A NEWS SHOW, REPORTEDLY A NEWS SHOW DEBATING AN ECONOMIST WHO WAS A REPUBLICAN ECONOMIST. AND WE ACTUALLY AGREED ON A LOT OF STUFF. AND WE CAME TO THE STATION BREAK AND IN MY EAR BUD, IN MY EAR PIECE THE PRODUCER SAID BE ANGRIER. I SAID I DON'T WANT TO BE ANGRIER. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE IT. WHY SHOULD I BE ANGRIER. BECAUSE YOU GOT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SURFING THROUGH HUNDREDS OF CHANNELS AND WILL ONLY STOP WHEN THEY SEE A GLADIATOR CONTEST. MUD WRESTLING. SO YOU HAVE TO BE ANGRIER. WE HAVE 10 SECONDS. I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ANGRY. SHE SAID YOU HAVE TO BE. AND THAT'S WHEN I LOST MY TEMPER. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: INEQUALITY FOR ALL. PLAYS IN SELECT CITIES BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 27th. ROBERT REICH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
