Jon:  WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE MAN. A COMEDY LEGEND. HIS NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED. "SO ANYWAY." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JOHN CLEESE. SIR! â™ª  WE'RE HONORED! I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXCITED AND HONORED WE ARE TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
Jon:  I SPENT MANY A DAY MEMORIZING JOHN CLEESE ROUTINES FROM THE GOOD OLD DAYS. JOHN CLEESE. "SO ANYWAY." I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING. OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE MY UTMOST RESPECT. YOU KNOW THAT. I'M A HUGE FAN. CAN WE GO BACK TO THE BOOK HERE? I FEEL LIKE THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN MORE TIME WITH THE PICTURE. THEY CUT OFF. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THIS BUT YOUR CHIN IS NOT EVEN IN THE SHOT.
WHAT?
Jon:  YEAH. I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A PHOTO EDITOR'S THING OR WHAT THAT -- IT WAS JUST ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I NOTICED.
ARE THEY ALL LIKE THIS? [LAUGHTER] THIS IS TERRIBLE.
Jon: TERRIBLE.
THIS IS TERRIBLE. LET'S GET RID OF IT.
Jon:  YEAH. OH, THIS IS CLASSY. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S NICE. I LIKE THAT. HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE AN IMPRESSIVE INDIVIDUAL. HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE IMPRESSIVE. YOU TAKE THAT OFF YOU GOT THE JOHN CLEESE HERE. THIS BOOK IS YOUR CAREER, PRE-PYTHON, ALL THE THINGS YOU DID UP TO THAT POINT.
YEAH.
Jon: GROWING UP WAS IT ENJOYABLE TO GO BACK AND VISIT THOSE SORT OF EARLY DAYS WHEN EXPECTATION YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? WAS IT A  CHARMING RIDE FOR YOU?
IT IS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. AND THE REASON I DID IT IS THAT I KNOW MICHAEL CAINE, AND I HAD LUNCH WITH HIM A LONG TIME AGO, AND HE HAD JUST WRITTEN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY. AND I SAID WHY DID YOU ENJOY IT SO MUCH AND HE SAID BECAUSE YOU RECLAIM BITS OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU'D TOTALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT. AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY NICE IS THAT WHEN YOU GET AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY NICE IS THAT WHEN YOU GET OLD YOU KNOW NOTHING MATTERS REALLY.
Jon:  THAT'S A WONDERFUL PROCESS. AT WHAT AGE, BECAUSE I'M IN THAT MIDDLE AGE AREA.
YOU ARE. WHAT ARE YOU 60, 62? [LAUGHTER] 65?
Jon:  33. [LAUGHTER]
33. OH, I'M SORRY, REALLY.
Jon:  IT'S, IT'S BEEN A LOT OF SUNSHINE AND TOBACCO.
REALLY?
Jon: IT'S -- YEAH. IT'S ACTUALLY, I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF LIFTS, I'VE GOT JUST A PONY TAIL OF SKIN IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK THAT I'M, IF YOU THINK THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GET A GIF OF ME MAKING YOU LAUGH OR GIF OR GIF AND PUT THAT UP ON MY WALL AND RUN IT 24 HOURS A DAY. YEAH.  YOU CAN SEE IT BACK THERE. THAT'S WHERE THE BALD SPOT GOES. BUT IT IS, IT'S THAT STAGE WHERE I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN RECLAIM THE YOUTH BUT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THAT SENSE OF THAT FREEDOM OF LETTING IT ALL GO.
I KNOW.
Jon: YOU STILL CARRY AROUND THE BURDEN.
YOU STILL CARE.
Jon:  YES
YES.
Jon: HOW DO I LOSE THAT?
YOU GET VERY VERY OLD AND THEN YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT YOU USED TO CARE ABOUT AND YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME. I MEAN, I HAVE THE MOST WONDERFUL WIFE. I'VE FORGOTTEN HER NAME. [LAUGHTER] WELL, I'VE HAD -- HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE I HAVE? AND I CALL HER FISH ANYWAY BECAUSE SHE SWIMS LIKE A FISH.
Jon: YOU SEE, THERE YOU GO.
AND WE HAVE THREE FANTASTIC CATS, TWO OF THEM AMERICAN. MAINE COONS.
Jon: OH OKAY SURE.
RIGHT?
Jon: MAINE COON CAT'S  A GREAT CAT.
THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THOUGHT THAT IF I WAS GOING TO HAVE ONE ENGLISH WIFE I SHOULD HAVE TWO AMERICAN CATS. BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW I'VE ONLY HAD AMERICAN WIVES. I WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
Jon:  I THINK THAT'S WISE.  AND YOU ARE LOVING YOUR LIFE.
I'M HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME.
Jon:  THIS IS VERY INSPIRING TO ME.
I JUST DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP], YOU KNOW? [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon: THAT SHOULD BE THE NAME OF IT. I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP].
YES, AND I USED TO. I USED TO GIVE A [BLEEP].
Jon: YEAH.
I REMEMBER QUITE SERIOUSLY WHEN I WAS FIRST MARRIED TO CONNIE BOOTH, I WATCHED THE AMERICAN ELECTION RESULTS AND NIXON --
Jon: IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
WAS ELECTED AND I ACTUALLY CRIED.
Jon: YEAH.
I CARED THAT MUCH AT THAT POINT.
Jon: THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS COGNIZANT.
AND NOW I THINK MITCH, MITCH WHAT'S HIS NAME?
Jon: MCCONNELL.
MCCONNELL.
Jon: SURE. SURE.
I THINK HE'S TERRIFIC. WOW. I WISH WE HAD ONE OF THOSE IN ENGLAND, YOU KNOW.
Jon:  WOULD YOU LIKE OURS? WE COULD, WE COULD SEND HIM. HE COULD GO THERE. [LAUGHTER]  HE'S A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.
I GATHER YOU DO A VERY GOOD --
Jon: MITCH MCCONNELL.
WOULD YOU DO IT?
Jon: AH YEP. IS THERE A PARTICULAR POLITICIAN IN ENGLAND OR AMERICA THAT YOU ENJOY MIMICKING, THAT YOU ENJOY TAKING THE PISS OUT OF? IS THERE SOMEONE? NOBODY.
NO. NO. NO. THEY'RE ALL VERY VERY FUNNY.
Jon:  YOU HAVE NO FAVORITES. YOU CHOOSE NO ONE.
NO. NO. I MEAN, IF SOMEBODY SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE DINNER WITH DAVID CAMERON --
Jon: YES.
YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY NO. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE -- I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY WITH MY CATS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  I LOVE THAT. YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING.  ON THAT NOTE, I THINK EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WHEN YOU FIRST CAME OUT AND YOU SAID I WAS HAVING A MEAL WITH MICHAEL CAINE.
YES.
Jon: I THINK EVERYONE HERE WENT, COULD WE GO TO THAT? [CROWD CHEERING] I THINK WE WOULD ALL VERY MUCH LIKE THAT. NEXT TIME IF YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH OR YOU'RE HAVING DINNER WITH MICHAEL CAINE IF WE COULD ALL COME. WE WON'T SAY ANYTHING WE WON'T ORDER ANYTHING. WE WILL STAND THERE AND OCCASIONALLY GASP.
WELL THERE IS AN IDEA AMONG THE PYTHONS THAT WE SHOULD REUNITE AND HAVE DINNER ON THE STAGE OF O2. JUST HAVE DINNER. AND THEN --
Jon THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLE. I WILL, LET ME SAY THIS.
16,000 PEOPLE COULD JUST WATCH, THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET WHAT WE WERE SAYING BUT THEY'D BE --
Jon: IT'S MARVELOUS.
THEY'D BE IN OUR PRESENCE.
Jon: BUT THEY WOULD WATCH YOU CHEWING. LET ME BUS THAT DINNER.
OKAY.
Jon: LET ME CLEAR THOSE DISHES AND CLEAN THEM HONESTLY. I WOULD DO THAT ONLY FOR YOU GUYS.  I WOULD, IT'S HOW I STARTED. ANYWAY IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES -- "SO ANYWAY" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THIS IS A PLEASURABLE MOMENT FOR ME. JOHN CLEESE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
