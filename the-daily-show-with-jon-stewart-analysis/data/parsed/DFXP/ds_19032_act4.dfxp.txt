WE'RE HERE TALKING WITH JORGE RAMOS UNIVISION, FUSION. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS MY POINT. THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS COURTED BY BOTH PARTIES. AND YOU ARE SEEING THOUGH THE CYNICISM ASSOCIATED WITH COURTING A NEW DEMOGRAPHIC. IT FEELS LIKE THE BALDNESS OF THE POLITICAL CALCULATIONS ARE EVIDENT TO YOU FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. WHO IN YOUR MIND IS DOING THE MORAL THING AND WHO IS DOING THE CYNICAL THING OR IS THERE NOT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.
I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS FINALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING. HOWEVER, THE MESSAGE HE IS CONTRADICTORY. HE IS SAYING I WANT YOU HERE. I'M HELPING YOU. I WANT IMMIGRATION REFORM AND AT THE SAME TIME HE'S DEPORTED. HE HAS DEPORTED TWO MILLION PEOPLE. AND NO OTHER PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF UNITED STATES HAS DEPORTED MORE PEOPLE THAN PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. HE IS SAYING I'M FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM BUT I'M DEPORTING YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER AND YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR NEIGHBOR SO. THAT HAS TO STOP.
Jon: TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN FIVE YEARS.
400,000 PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE IS FIGHTING FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM FINALLY, HOWEVER DEPORTATIONS HAVE TO STOP. YOU CAN SAY I LOVE YOU AND THEN GO BACK HOME.
Jon: WHAT IS TYPICAL -- JUST TO GIVE ME CONTEXT WHAT IS A TYPICAL NUMBER -- THAT SOUNDS ENORMOUS IS THAT SEIZING PEOPLE AT THE BORDER AND SENDING THEM BACK. GOING TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND BREAKING UP FAMILY?
NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO HOUSES BUT THEY GO TO OFFICES AND TO STORES, SOMETIMES BUS STATIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING THAT THEY ARE CONCENTRATING ON CRIMINALS. THE REALITY IS THAT A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THOSE DEPORTING ARE NOT CRIMINALS OR TERRORISTS. IF PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD GIVE ACTION TO SOME HE COULD DO SOMETHING SIMILAR. UNTIL WE HAVE IMMIGRATION REFORM IT'S A SHAME FOR THE SYSTEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.
IT'S A SHAMEFUL SYSTEM AND IT'S ONE THAT IS SHOCKING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT JUST A FEW -- YOU KNOW, ONE OF LARGEST IMMIGRATION AMNESTY BILLS WAS RONALD REAGAN WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT WHAT THE REPUBLICAN POLICY WAS OR USED TO BE. IT SHIFTED DRASTICALLY AND THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WITH IT AS WELL MUST BE A DISAPPOINTMENT. WILL THE LATINO COMMUNITY SEE THROUGH THE CYNICAL EFFORT AND WILL IT REQUIRE A MORE HONEST EFFORT TO COURT THEIR VOTE?
I THINK SO. A FEW YEARS AGO WE JUST NEEDED A FEW WORDS IN SPANISH FROM THE CANDIDATE. HOLA, BUENOS DIAS. I WANT YOUR VOTE.
Jon: SORRY I LOST YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.
THAT'S WHY BUSH GOT IT AT THAT TIME. THEN WE REALIZED THAT 12 MILLION LATINOS VOTING IN THE LAST ELECTION, 16 MILLION WILL VOTE IN THE NEXT ONE. WE GOT PROMISES FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. HE DIDN'T KEEP HIS PROMISE.
Jon: IS IMMIGRATION REFORM THE ONE TRULY DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUE THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT?
NO.
Jon: I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY ISSUE THEY WOULD NEED TO COURT A COMMUNITY. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MORE COMMONALITY ISSUES YOU WOULD SAY ARE IMPORTANT?
POLLS SHOW THAT LATINOS ARE JUST LIKE THE REST OF AMERICANS. MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS JOBS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE.
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THEY WATCH EIGHT HOURS OF TELEVISION A DAY.
10-12 ON UNIVISION WHICH IS GREAT.
Jon: WE'VE HEARD FROM THE RIGHT THEY ARE A MORE CONSERVATIVE GROUP OVERALL. COMPARED TO IMMIGRATION THEY LINE UP MORE CLOSELY WITH REPUBLICANS.
THE THING IS THAT IMMIGRATION REFORM IS LIKE A PREREQUISITE FOR LATINOS TO SEE BEYOND WHATEVER YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. AND FOR REPUBLICANS THEY REALLY HAVE TO PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM SO WE CAN SEE BEYOND. THAT IT'S PERSONAL. I'M AN IMMIGRANT. HALF OF ALL LATINOS ARE IMMIGRANTS. THEY ARE FOREIGN BORN. YOU CAN GIVE ME JOBS AND HEALTH CARE BUT IF YOU ARE SAYING GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: IS IT NOT EVEN A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE BUT A CHANGE IN ATTITUDE OF A SENSE OF TREATING IT AS, YOU KNOW, I GET THE SENSE SOMETIMES THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO FEEL THERE'S A PART OF AMERICA THAT IS SOMEHOW BEING STOLEN FROM THEM BY THE NEWER IMMIGRANTS. MY GRANDFATHER WAS SIMILAR THIS WAY BY THE WAY HE VIEWED IMMIGRANTS. HE WAS AN IMMIGRANT. HE SIGNED IN AT ELLIS ISLAND AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND WENT GET OFF MY LAND. [ LAUGHTER ] HE WAS, I GUESS WOULD YOU CALL IT, RACIST. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE WORST IS WHEN YOU SEE IMMIGRANTS OR THEIR SONS CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND THEM. I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR TED CRUZ. HIS FATHER WAS BORN IN CUBA AND BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN. HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP TO NEW IMMIGRANTS. I ASKED HIM HOW COME YOUR FATHER GOT A CHANCE BUT YOU DON'T WANT 11 MILLION IMMIGRANTS YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM THE SAME CHANCE? IT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IS VERY CLEAR. ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS COUNTRY YOU HAVE 11 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TREATED EQUALLY.
IT TOOK US A WHILE WITH WOMEN AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER GROUPS. DON'T FEEL BAD. [LAUGHTER] > AND NOW THE NEW    FRONTIER ON CIVIL RIGHTS IS IMMIGRATION.
Jon: THERE A PREJUDICE WITHIN THE LATINO COMMUNITY THAT WOULD --
WITHIN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY?
Jon: THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE CHANGED AS THEY BECOME A MORE VITAL FORCE IN AMERICAN POLITICS AS WELL? IS THERE SOMETHING HOLDING THEM BACK AS WELL?
WITHIN THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY, YES.
Jon: OF HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT AMERICA OR AMERICANS OR THEIR COMMUNITY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?
WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT ONCE THEY ARE LEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY MILLIONS OF LATINOS, LEGAL RESIDENTS THEY DON'T BECOME U.S. CITIZENS.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?
THEY DON'T FEEL PART OF THIS COUNTRY YET. I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT. MAYBE THEY DON'T FEEL WELCOME EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE HERE LEGALLY. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PART FULLY OF UNITED STATES. THAT HAS TO CHANGE.
Jon: EVEN AFTER WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE LOVE OF TORTILLA? STILL NOTHING? THAT MIGHT HELP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT'S FASCINATING, MAN. IT MUST BE A VERY EXCITING TIME BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF A COMMUNITY COMING TO PROMINENCE AND BE A VOICE FOR THAT.
IT IS.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. AMERICA WITH JORGE RAMOS AIRS ON TUESDAYS. WHERE DO YOU -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
