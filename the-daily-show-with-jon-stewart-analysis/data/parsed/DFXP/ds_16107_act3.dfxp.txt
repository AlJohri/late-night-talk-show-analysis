Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS CNN'S CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT. HIS FORTH COMING BOOK DUE OUT IN NOVEMBER IS CALLED "HOW TO SPEAK MONEY: THE LANGUAGE AND  KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED NOW." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ALI VELSHI. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU, SIR. GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jon: EXPLAIN TO ME, I WATCH TELEVISION. THE STOCK MARKET, A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED TO THE STOCK MARKET. IT WENT DOWN 600 POINTS ON NEWS OF EUROPE. THEN THE NEXT DAY FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND EUROPE WAS STILL VERY SIMILAR TO HOW IT HAD  BEEN THE DAY BEFORE. AND IT WENT UP 500 POINTS. THEN THE NEXT DAY IT WENT DOWN 450 POINTS ON NEWS OF SOMETHING. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT WENT UP 300. ARE THEY (BEEP) WITH US?
YOU KNOW, IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE THE COMPANIES THAT  MAKE UP THE STOCK MARKET DIDN'T CHANGE. THEY WEREN'T WORTH 5% LESS THE NEXT DAY AND THEY WEREN'T WORTH 3% MORE AFTER THAT. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THE STOCK MARKET IS THE COLLECTION OF A VALUE OF UNDERLYING COMPANIES. THAT'S WHAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE, BUT THE STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN A BAROMETER OF  HOW INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD KIND OF FEEL ABOUT THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING. THAT'S THE STUFF YOU'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.
Jon: MORE OF A MOOD RING.
EXACTLY. IT'S A MOOD RING WITH A BIG BOARD THAT YOU CAN WATCH ALL THE TIME.
Jon: HAVE WE GOTTEN TO THE POINT, ARE WE TOO HOOKED INTO THIS IDEA OF THE STOCK MARKET  AS A PERMANENT THERMOMETER.
YES.
Jon: OF THE HEALTH OF OUR NATION, ECONOMICALLY AND OTHERWISE.
ABSOLUTELY WE ARE. ABSOLUTELY WE ARE. IT'S ONE MEASURE.
Jon: WHAT IS A MEASURE THAT WOULD PERHAPS OR IS IT JUST TOO COMPLICATED TO REALLY SHOW  GRAPHICALLY TO TELEVISION VIEWERS, WHAT WOULD GIVE US A BETTER SENSE OF THE UNDERLYING HEALTH?
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A REAL FEEL FOR THE ECONOMY. REALLY WE ALL FEEL IT IN OUR LIVES. THE THREE THINGS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL PROSPEROUS IN YOUR LIFE ARE THE VALUE OF YOUR  INVESTMENTS GOING UP IF YOU HAVE INVESTMENTS. THAT'S THE STOCK MARKET. NUMBER TWO THE VALUE OF YOUR HOME GOING UP IF YOU HAVE A HOME. BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY LIVE WITHOUT INVESTMENTS AND A HOME. YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT AN INCOME. SO YOUR JOB AND THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL EARN AND CONTINUE TO EARN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. THE STOCK MARKET IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THE DEBT CEILING IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. EMPLOYMENT OR UNEMPLOYMENT THAT WE HAVE NOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL GOOD OR BAD ABOUT. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: NOW I WATCH C-SPAN.
I LIKE THESE PEOPLE.
Jon: VERY NICE PEOPLE. I WATCH THE C-SPAN ALL AND THESE THINGS. ALL OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IF  IT'S SOMETHING THEY DON'T LIKE WILL SAY WE SHOULDN'T BE  TALKING ABOUT THAT, WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT JOBS. BACK AND FORTH. THEY KEEP SAYING WE SHOULD REALLY BE TALKING ABOUT JOBS. LET'S TALK ABOUT JOBS. WHAT CAN THEY ACTUALLY DO ABOUT JOBS AND IS THAT JUST A KUJAL THEY USE TO SHUT THE OTHER PERSON UP? IS THERE ANYTHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO? IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT THEY USED TO DO WITH TERRORISM. WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT TERRORISM IF THEY  BROUGHT UP SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
I WISH WE HAD TREATED JOBS THE WAY WE TREATED THIS DEBT CEILING WHICH WAS A BIT OF A  MANUFACTURED CRISIS. JOBS ISN'T. WHAT IF WE ACTUALLY GOT EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND SAID IF THERE WAS SOME DEADLINE TO  FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CREATE JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PASSION THAT WENT  INTO THIS RIDICULOUS DEBT CEILING DEBATE WENT INTO HOW DID WE ACTUALLY GET JOBS CREATED? GOVERNMENT CAN'T CREATE JOBS UNLESS IT'S A STIMULUS WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HIRE PEOPLE TO  DO THINGS BUT THEY CAN CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR COMPANIES TO HIRE PEOPLE. THAT MIGHT BE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT, REDUCING PAYROLL TAXES. GENERALLY ACCOMMODATING BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT HIRE SOMEBODY. ULTIMATELY YOU DON'T HIRE SOMEBODY UNLESS THERE'S DEMAND. BUT NUMBER THREE WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT  TRAINED FOR THE THINGS WE ACTUALLY NEED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO. SO WHAT IF WE HAD A WAY FOR THOSE UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED IN THE WRONG  THINGS TO GET RETRAININGED, TAKE THE TIME OUT TO DO THAT, MAYBE IT'S A YEAR OR TWO YEARS, MAYBE IT'S LONGER.
Jon: WHO WOULD RETRAIN IT?
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THERE ARE COMPANIES, COLLEGES THAT DO THIS OR YOU GO TO A COLLEGE TO BECOME A NURSE IF  YOU WERE A MANUFACTURING WORKER.
Jon: WHO PAYS FOR YOU... IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.
WHAT IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD GUARANTEE THE COST OF THAT TRANSFORMATION.
Jon: SO YOU'RE A SOCIALIST?
MA WHAT IF THE BANKS DO IT? THE BANKS CAN DO IT. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT WOULD COST TO REINVENT YOURSELF. WHAT IF YOU CAN TAKE THAT CALCULATION AND SAY IT'S GOING COST ME THAT MUCH MONEY AND  I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS MUCH MORE AND PAY TAXES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHY NOT FINANCE THAT TRANSFORMATION.
Jon: WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK YOU SOUND RATIONAL. THIS SOUNDS DO-ABLE. IT DOES NOT SOUND IDEOLOGICALLY INSANE. IT SOUNDS LIKE A MIXTURE OF SOME SUGGESTIONS AND REMEDIES FROM DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE AISLE. WHAT IS IT ABOUT GETTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT DONE AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE  PUBLIC SECTOR BECAUSE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS FREE TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO. WHAT IS HOLDING THIS UP? WHAT IS THE OBSTACLE? IS IT ALL SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS?
WELL, I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE ARE NOW SORT OF 25 YEARS INTO THIS IDEA ABOUT HOW  GOVERNMENT IS... INTERFERES IN YOUR LIFE AND IS BAD FOR YOUR LIFE. NOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO CONGRESS ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WILL BE  UNCOMPROMISING IN THEIR REPRESENTATION OF THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS AS OPPOSED TO  GOING TO CONGRESS IN ORDER TO FIND COMPROMISES THAT ARE GOOD FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. I THINK WE'VE JUST GOTTEN TO THIS POINT WHERE WE'RE SO DUG IN ON MY PARTICULAR INTEREST  WHICH IS LIKELY IN MANY CASES NO NEW TAXES OR DON'T RAISE TAXES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPROMISE.
Jon: ISN'T WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IF YOU JUST REMOVE TAXES AND ANY REGULATION, SUDDENLY OUR ECONOMY WOULD GET BACK ON SOLID FOOTING AND WE WOULD ONCE AGAIN BUILD RAILROADS....
THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THAT. THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THAT. THERE'S ALSO SOME TRUTH TO THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW WOULDN'T BE A GREAT TIME TO RAISE TAXES. BUT THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE AROUND  WHERE PRIVATE SECTOR MONEY CAN GO.
Jon: EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE.
THAT MEANS TRUSTING YOUR GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT CAN'T INFLUENCE ANYTHING BECAUSE NOBODY TRUSTS GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW.
Jon: VERY INTERESTING, ALI VELSHI. ( APPLAUSE ) IF WE WERE TO DO THESE THINGS IT'S AS THOUGH WE WOULD HAVE A  FUNCTIONING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE COUNTRY AGAIN.
YEAH.
Jon: VERY INTERESTING. I WILL PASS YOUR WORDS ON. ALI VELSHI. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
