Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT. OH, WE LOVE HIM. HIS NEW FILM:
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW WILL FERRELL. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOT ALL COMEDIANS WEAR HELMETS? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE A C, AND A T, AND A D. DICK.
Jon: SO ALL THREE.
YOU'RE ALL THREE.
Jon: AT THE SAME TIME.
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
Jon: NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. THAT IS A MIRACLE.
THAT IS A MIRACLE.
Jon: WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHERE DID I FIND THIS? I'M A COMEDIAN AND I'M WEARING MY COMEDY HELMET. ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAD THAT HERE. THE HELMET THING. YOU WERE LIKE, HEY, DOES ANYBODY HAVE A BIKE HELMET OR A ROLLER BLADE HELMET. WHERE THE (BEEP) DID YOU GET A BIKE HELMET?
IT MUST BE FROM THE DAILY SHOW SOFTBALL TEAM.
Jon: HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
NOT ONLY THAT YOU HAD THREE OF THEM. I HAD TO CHOOSE FROM THREE OF THEM.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE THREE? SIZING.
NO THIS ONE JUST LOOKED SMART.
Jon: YOU LOOK LIKE THE GREAT GAZU RIGHT NOW.
IT REALLY SHOWS HOW LAME A BATTING HELMET LOOKS IF YOU'RE NOT PLAYING BASEBALL.
Jon: IT REALLY DOES. MOST HELMETS IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THE THING THAT IT'S DESIGNED TO BE DOING... EVEN A  BIKE HELMET.
I TAKE THAT BACK. IF YOU'RE WEARING A COOL BAD-ASS MOTORCYCLE HELMET.  YOU COULD WALK IN SOME PLACE AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY, ALL RIGHT. I LIKE THAT GUY. BUT IF I WALK INTO THE LOCAL TAVERN AND SAY, HEY, PETE, HEY, JOHN, HOW ARE YOU? I'LL HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE AND A HAM SANDWICH. BUT.
Jon: BUT I THINK IF YOU WENT INTO A LOCAL BAR AND ORDERED A COFFEE AND A HAM  SANDWICH THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T GO TO MY BAR.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK IF YOU HAD A HELMET YOU COULD BE LIKE A COLORFUL CHARACTER LIKE  JOHNNY SOFT SKULL IS HERE.
LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD GUY THAT EVERYONE TAKES PITY ON.
Jon: THE ONE WHO WEARS THE HELMET ALL THE TIME.
IF YOU WORE IT LONG ENOUGH, YOU WOULD THEN BE ACCEPTED.
Jon: HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU AND I COULD BET THAT YOU'LL WEAR THIS HELMET? HOW LONG WOULD YOU DO IT? WOULD YOU WEAR THIS HELMET FOR 24 HOURS?
EASILY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY LIKE A MONTH. WOULD I WEAR IT FOR A MONTH. SO THAT EVERY PUBLIC APPEARANCE YOU SAW FROM THIS POINT ON....
Jon: (LAUGHING)
AM I ALLOWED TO EXPLAIN THE HELMET? NO, I DON'T GET TO EXPLAIN IT.
Jon: NO. YOU JUST HAVE TO WEAR IT. EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, SOME OF YOUR PEOPLE WITH YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. AND DO THAT.
I WOULD DO IT.
Jon: IF YOU DID THAT FOR A MONTH I WOULD WEAR A CHEST PROTECTOR FOR A MONTH. THINK ABOUT IT.
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. SEE, I HAVE TO FLY TONIGHT. I HAVE TO GO ON A PLANE.
Jon: WHAT BETTER TIME TO WEAR A HELMET?
YEAH. ARE THEY GOING TO LET ME GET THIS THROUGH SECURITY THOUGH?
Jon: NOT ONLY WILL YOU GET THROUGH SECURITY YOU'LL SET A NEW PLANE TRAVEL TREND. PEOPLE WILL START LINING UP WITH HELMETS ON.
LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.
Jon: WE DON'T.
I'M ONLY OUT HERE FOR FOUR MINUTES.
Jon: THE FILM....
YES IT'S ALL IN SPANISH. I SPEAK SPANISH. I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH BUT I LEARNED SPANISH FOR THIS MOVIE. INCREDIBLE CAST.
Jon: IF YOU'RE GOING TO START PITCHING YOUR MOVIE, I REALLY SHOULD PUT THE HELMET ON. HERE WE GO. ( APPLAUSE ) I DO NOT HAVE A HELMET. MY HEAD JUST DOESN'T... IT'S LIKE....
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED VERY GOOD.
Jon: I'M SUDDENLY SEVEN YEARS OLD. PUT IT BACK ON YOU. I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH OR KNOW WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE. LET ME SAY THIS, IT SOUNDED LIKE GREAT SPANISH.
IT'S GOOD. I'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S VERY GOOD SPANISH.
Jon: EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY WEARING A HELMET CARRIES MORE WEIGHT.
IT CERTAINLY DOES.
Jon: WHEN YOU SAY IT WITH A HELMET I'M LIKE (BEEP) THIS GUY IS IN DANGER. THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT YOUR MOVIE IS. YOU PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER.
I PUT MYSELF IN DANGER AND I DECIDED TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO COME HERE. I COULD HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE IN THE CITY. BUT I'M HERE. I'M IN DANGER SO I WEAR MY HELMET.
Jon: PEOPLE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT CONCUSSIONS AND COMEDIANS.
THEY REALLY DON'T.
Jon: IT'S ABOUT TIME.
THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS SERIES OF PSAs. AND I'M ALSO ON FOX AND FRIENDS.
Jon: TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE WEARING (BEEP) HELMETS. ALL RIGHT. SO CASE DE ME POTTER.
CASA DE ME PADRE.
Jon: WOW. IT'S GOING TO BE IN THEATERS... WHAT'S THE SPANISH WORD FOR FRIDAY.
IT MEANS THE VAGINA OF THE SUN. I DIDN'T LEARN IT. I JUST COULDN'T SAY IT THE RIGHT WAY. IT WOULD BE IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY.
Jon: IN SPANISH HOW DO YOU SAY FRIDAY? VAGINA.
WHAT IS IT? VIERNES.
Jon: THAT COUNTS.
I KNOW HOW TO SAY VAGINA IN SWEDISH.
Jon: HOW.
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE C-WORD IN SWEDISH. DON'T SAY THAT.
