I DID. NOT ONLY YOUR WRITING PARTNER, THE GENTLEMAN OF WHICH THIS IS BASED SOMEWHAT  OF A BEST FRIEND GOING OUT THING.
ISH, YEAH, WE DATED FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME, 13 YEARS AGO.
OH, SO IT WAS, HOW LONG DID YOU DATE FOR?
IT WAS IN THE 09s AND IT WAS LIKE THREE WEEKS.
Jon: YOU MAKE SOUND LIKE A RAVE THAT GOT OUT OF CONTROL. IT WAS LIKE IN THE 90s.
YOU COULD LOSE THREE WEEKS IN THE 90S.
Jon: YOU REALLY COULD. SO YOU AND THIS GENTLEMAN WILL, WERE YOU FRIENDS PRIOR TO THE DATING.
NO, WE WERE SET UP. WE DATED. WE WERE KIND OF IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER FOR THREE WEEKS.
Jon: REALLY.
YEAH. WE WERE DRUNK THE WHOLE TIME.
Jon: SURE.
AND THEN WE FIGURED IT OUT SOONER THAN LATER THAT FRIENDSHIP WAS BETTER.
Jon: WHEN DID THE FIZZLE ON A THREE WEEK RUN?
DAY 17? WHEN DID THE-- WHEN DID THE SOBERING UP WHEN YOU WENT --
I THINK THE FIZZLE WAS PROBABLY TIMED DIFFERENTLY FOR THE BOTH OF US WHICH IS  PART OF THE PROBLEM.
Jon: INTERESTING.
I WAS SUPERINTO IT AND HE WASN'T OVER HIS EXBE GIRLFRIEND WHY ARE WE  TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.
Jon: BECAUSE NOW THAT OPERA IS OFF OF TELEVISION SOMEONE HAS TO FILL THE GAP.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB.

YOU ARE RIGHT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHY, BECAUSE LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN, IF YOU THINK IT YOU CAN BUILD IT WITH LIKE A RING AND --

Jon: I JUST WENT COMIC BOOK BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
DO YOU FIND FOR YOURSELF NOW, IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN  SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE ACTING, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU ARE WRITING FOR YOUR VOICE IN PARTICULAR.
YES.
Jon: DO YOU FIND IT TO BE AN EASIER TASK.
YES, YOU SHOULD KNOW.
Jon: I DON'T, BECAUSE I CAN'T ACT.
YOU ACT A LITTLE BIT, DON'T YOU. DIDN'T YOU ACT A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: I THINK A LITTLE BIT WOULD BE THE SUM OF MY CAREER, YES. BUT IT'S NOT ACTING. IT'S LIKE I COULD BE 10% ANGRIER THAN NORMAL, RIGHT. LIKE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY AND I'M LIKE OKAY-- THAT STILL SUCKED.
IT IS EASIER, YES, IT'S EASIER FOR SURE. AND WE WROTE TO OUR STRENGTHS BECAUSE BOTH WILL AND I ARE IN THE MOVIE. AND I WROTE TO THE STRENGTH OF MY FLAWS. SO I AM KIND OF NOT THAT LIKABLE IN THE MOVIE.
