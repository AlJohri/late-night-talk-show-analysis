FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART! [ APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW", MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST THE NEW EPA ADMINISTRATOR, GINA MCCARTHY, I AM GOING TO ASK HER ABOUT FRACKING. BUT FIRST, LAST WEEK, WHILE WE WERE OFF WE MISSED SOME HIGH DRAMA.
APPARENTLY A FELLOW NAMED CLIVEN BUNDY, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH HIS MORE SOPHISTICATED BROTHER, AL, OR HIS MORE ATHLETIC BROTHER, KING KONG.
NOW OLD CLIVEN BUNDY HAD BEEN GRAZING HIS CATTLE ILLEGALLY ON FEDERAL LAND IN NEVADA FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW, ACCRUING ABOUT $1 MILLION IN GRAZING FEES, PENALTIES AND FINES. UNFORTUNATELY MR. BUNDY HAS ALSO REPEATEDLY IGNORED COURT ORDERS TO CEASE AND DESIST VIS-A-VIS SAID GRAZING. SO, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT CAME TO TAKE HIS CATTLE, IT IS YOUR STANDARD BOY HAS COW, BOY BREAKS LAW FOR 20 YEARS, BOY LOSES COW STORY. OR SO WE THOUGHT.
HUNDREDS OF ARMED MILITIA MEN RALLYING TO SUPPORT THE BUNDIES, FACING OFF WITH THE FEDS AT GUNPOINT.
JIM LORDI CAME FROM MONTANA TO JOIN THE PROTESTERS.
HE SAYS, HE AND OTHER MILITIA MEMBERS ARE NOT AFRAID TO SHOOT IF NECESSARY.
WE WERE ACTUALLY STRATEGIZING TO PUT ALL THE WOMEN UP AT THE FRONT. IF THEY ARE GOING TO START SHOOTING IT IS GOING TO BE WOMEN THAT ARE GOING TO BE TELEVISED ALL ACROSS THE WORLD GETTING SHOT BY THESE ROGUE FEDERAL OFFICERS.
Jon: ANYWAY, HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, SWEETY.
HE SEEMS NICE. APPARENTLY WE HAVE OURSELVES A STANDOFF AT WOUNDED LOIN, YES. THE ARMED STANDOFF OVER THIS MAN ILLEGALLY GRAZING HIS CATTLE IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S NEW SEGMENT, I DON'T GET IT.
BROUGHT TO YOU BY -- HUH?
HUH?  IT IS A SOUND YOU MAKE WHEN YOU DON'T GET IT.
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE WEST, EVERYONE WANTS TO ROMANTICIZE IT, LAST FRONTIER OF LIBERTY, RIDING THE RAILS ON THE OPEN RANGE, EATING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BEANS AROUND THE CAMPFIRE, NOT CARING ABOUT THE NORMAL SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF EATING THOSE BEANS BECAUSE WHO IS GOING TO COMPLAIN?  THE COYOTES?  NOT IF THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR THEM.
BABING!
BABING.
THAT'S THE NOISE YOU MAKE TO SCARE THEM AWAY. > HOW IS THIS GUY BUNDY A HERO?  HOW IS THIS GUY BUNDY A HERO FOR IGNORING FEDERAL LAW AND WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION?
I ABIDE BY ALL OF NEVADA STATE LAWS, BUT I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS EVEN EXISTING. [LAUGHTER.]
Jon: I AM AS AGAINST GOVERNMENT OVERREACH AS THE NEXT GUY, BUT I DON'T THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OVERREACHING BY SAYING IT EXISTS.
THIS GUY -- HECK, I AM JUST A SIMPLE FELLOW, SOME FOLKS CALL A CARTESIAN FOLLOWER, RENE DESCARTES.
AND WITHOUT IMMEDIATE SENSORY PROOF, HOW AM I TO TAKE  GOVERNMENT EXISTENCE AS PRIMA FACIE ASSUMPTION. (Bleep), WHAT IF WE'RE ALL JUST BRAINS IN A JAR? I HAVE TO PAY YOU FOR GRAZING MY IMAGINARY BRAIN JAR CATTLE?  WHO DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?  (Bleep) JON LOCKE?  PATOO!  PATOO!
RIGHT NOW, SOMEWHERE A JUNIOR PHILOSOPHY MAJOR JUST (BLEEP)ED IN HIS PANTS.
ALL RIGHT. SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT PROVE THE GOVERNMENT EXISTS, DID YOU LOOK AT THE END OF THIS? YOU SEE THAT THING YOU ARE HOLDING THERE, FELLOW?  IF YOU REJECT THE AMERICAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO CREATE YOUR OWN DAMNED FLAG.
I DON'T GIVE THE CONFEDERACY CREDIT FOR MUCH BUT AT LEAST THEY HAD A GRAPHIC DESIGN TEAM THAT WAS WORTH A (BLEEP).
SO, THE LAW ISN'T ON BUNDY'S SIDE, THE COURT ISN'T ON BUNDY'S SIDE, EVEN THE NEVADA STATE CONSTITUTION WHICH BUNDY CLAIMS TO ABIDE ISN'T ON BUNDY'S SIDE, WHO THE (bleep) IS ON THIS GUY'S SIDE?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHY YOU THINK YOUR CASE HAS RESONATED SODMUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
HANNITY!
I STILL DON'T GET IT.
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY WANT TO BUILD A SCHOOL, A ROAD OR A HOSPITAL. THAT LAND IS GOING TO STAY VACANT WHETHER OR NOT YOUR CATTLE ARE ON IT OR NOT, RIGHT?  WHEN YOUR CATTLE GRAZE THERE, THAT KEEPS THE PRICE OF MEAT DOWN FOR EVERY AMERICAN CONSUMER.
YES, MOST GOODS ARE CHEAPER WHEN YOU STEAL THE RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM. IN FACT HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICES AT FELL OFF A TRUCK MART? SO APPARENTLY SEAN HANNITY THINKS LAWS ARE SERVED BUFFET STYLE, IN THAT YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE THE ONES THAT YOU LIKE BEST, THE ONES YOU DON'T LIKE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ABIDE. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO SIT WELL WITH FOX NEWS' IMMIGRATION SLASH HEALTHCARE LAW EXPERT PUNDIT, A MR. SEAN HANNITY.
YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD OBEY THE LAWS YOU WANT TO OBEY. OBEY THE LAWS YOU LIKE?
NO, NO.
THAT'S ALL?  WHY DON'T YOU JOIN WITH ME, JUAN AND SAY EVERYBODY SHOULD OBEY THE LAW? TELL ME HOW THE PRESIDENT CAN UNILATERALLY PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PART OF THE LAW HE WILL UPHOLD AT WHATEVER TIME HE CHOOSES.
Jon: I MEAN, THE GUY IS NOT EVEN WEARING A COWBOY HAT. THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T GET TO CHOOSE.
APPARENTLY HE SELECTS COWBOY HATS WHICH LAWS YOU WILL OBEY LIKE SOME SORT OF LEGAL SORTING HAT.
BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE WORST HARRY POTTER EVER.
OR MAYBE SEAN JUST RESPECTS PEOPLE WHO FIGHT FOR THEIR PRINCIPLES, EVEN AFTER THEY LOSE THEIR CASE IN COURT.
A GROUP OF ATHEISTS LOST THEIR BATTLE WITH THE STATE OF UTAH OVER 14 STEEL CROSS HIGHWAY MEMORIALS, AND THE JUDGE'S RULING, YOU GUYS LOST.
THAT WILL BE OVERTURNED.
NO, YOU LOST.
Jon: AH. I GUESS UNLESS YOUR FRIENDS ARE ARMED AND READY TO HAVE YOUR WOMENFOLK SHOT. [LAUGHTER.]
Jon: NOW, I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE SCAMMING OFF THE TAXPAYERS, SEAN.
MY NEXT GUEST IS A CALIFORNIA SURFER, HE LIVES ON FOOD STAMPS, I WANT YOU TO REALIZE YOU ARE TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY AND YOU ARE LIVING A SELFISH LIFE.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL -- [LAUGHTER.]
Jon: -- THERE IS NO WAY THAT'S (BLEEP) THAT GUY'S HAIR. THERE'S NO WAY. THAT IS YOUNG HAIR BUT UNDERNEATH THOSE GLASSES IS AN OLD FACE. AND IT'S TOO BAD SURFER DUDE ISN'T A COW, OTHERWISE HANNITY WOULD BE FINE WITH THE GOVERNENT PAYING FOR HIS MEALS.
ALSO IT WOULD BE COOL TO SEE A SURFING COW. IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BUNDY FELLER IS BLINDING HANNITY TO ALL THE THINGS THAT WOULD NORMALLY DRIVE HANNITY MAD WITH RAGE. IS IT THE HAT? BECAUSE WE CAN GIVE HIM A DIFFERENT HAT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? AND YOU KNOW WHAT, GIVE HIM A DIFFERENT HAIRSTYLE. AND A NEW SHIRT. AND A PAIR OF DEVIL STICKS.
OH, NO, HE IS AN OCCUPY WALL STREET PROTESTER.
TRESPASSING ON LAND THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO HIM, GET 'EM, SEAN!
YOU ARE PROTESTER OF THE DAY AND YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT AND TAKE A SHOWER.
TAKE OVER A PARK AND SLEEP ON THE STREET.
Jon: NOW THAT IS THE WAY YOU TALK TO A TRESPASSER WHO VOTES DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU. HOW OUT THERE IS HANNITY ON THIS ISSUE?
I HAVE CATTLE. AND I HAVE PEOPLE THAT GRAZE ON MY LAND, GRAZING FEES ARE NORMAL, AND YOU STOPPED PAYING THEM. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WOULD SAY THAT YOU ARE, LET ME QUOTE A WELFARE RANCHER.
Jon: SEAN HANNITY HAS NOW MADE GLENN BECK THE VOICE OF REASON. [LAUGHTER.] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: IF YOU WANT, IF YOU WANT TO CHALLENGE THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL LAND THE GOVERNMENT OWNS IN THE STATE OF NEVADA, FINE, MAKE YOUR CASE TO THE VOTERS, IF YOU WANT TO CHALLENGE THE CONCEPT OF GRAZING FEES, FINE BUT HANNITY'S PUFFERY AND ARMED FRIENDS DON'T MAKE YOU A PATRIOT.
I GUESS MAYBE I'M A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE FOUNDING FATHERS.
Jon: DUDE, YOU'RE A WELFARE RANCHER TRYING TO PULL OFF THE LARGEST CATTLE DINE AND DASH. WE'LL BE RIGHT
