Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM. WE'RE TALKING WITH KING ABDULLAH  II OF JORDAN. LET'S TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT  IRAN. THEY SEEM TO BE IN THAT PART OF  THE WORLD THE REAL ELEPHANT IN  THE ROOM THAT EVERYBODY EVEN  SUPPOSED ALLIES ARE VERY WARY OF RIGHT NOW. WOULD YOU SAY-- AND MAYBE YOU  CAN'T SAY-- ARE THEY THE BIGGEST  PROBLEM IN THE WORLD? AND--  (LAUGHTER).
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY THE ISSUE IS  ON EVERYBODY'S MIND IS THEIR  NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S WHAT I  WAS GETTING AT AT.
BUT THE WAY I PUT IT TO THOSE  THAT WILL LISTEN IS THAT THE  REASON WHY THEY HAVE A NUCLEAR  PROGRAM IS BECAUSE OF WHAT ISRAEL IS DOING TO THE  PALESTINIANS IN THE FUTURE FOR  JERUSALEM. SO MY ARGUMENT IS THAT THE  ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SOLVE  THEIR PROBLEMS THAT ALLOWS FOR  THE ISRAELIS AND ARABS TO COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A PEACE TREATY  THEN THERE'S NO LONGER A RAY SON  DEBT A FOR IRAN TO HAVE A  NUCLEAR WEAPON. BECAUSE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN  ARE A WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES  THE LAST PEOPLE WHO WANT FOR  ISRAEL AND IRAN TO HAVE A NUCLEAR STRIKE IS GOING TO BE  US.
Jon: SURE.
SO THE EASIER CHEAPER WAY OF  SOLVING THE PROBLEMS IS FOR THE  ISRAELIS AND ARABS TO SOLVE  THEIR PROBLEM WHICH IS IS THE ISRAELI PALESTINIAN ISSUE. IT'S VERY SIMPLISTIC,  OBVIOUSLY--
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND. BUT THE THING YOU WONDER IS HOW  MUCH OF THE ISRAELI/PALESTINIAN  ISSUE-- I'M SURE IT'S VERY  CONCERNING TO THOSE OTHER POWERS BUT DO THEY USE IT TO SOME  EXTENT TO DISTRACT THEIR OWN  POPULATIONS FROM THEIR OWN  ECONOMIC TROUBLES, THEIR OWN LACK OF GOVERNANCE? ARE THEY GOING TO ALSO HAVE TO  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR  OWN-- IT'S VERY EASY, THERE WAS  A BIG EXPLOSION, THIS TERRIBLE FILM THAT WENT ON YOUTUBE AND  THE ARAB WORLD EXPLODED. BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR AMERICAN WES  SEE THERE'S BURNING AMERICAN  FLAGS EVERY FRIDAY IS OBVIOUSLY  DEATH TO AMERICA FRIDAY, FREE  WINGS. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, IS THERE-- IS THERE A  SENSE THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS ALSO  SEEN AS VITRIOLIC AND VOLATILE?
WELL, GOING TO THE FIRST PART  OF THE QUESTION. I MEAN IRAN, AS YOU SEE  HISTORICALLY FOR ANY REVOLUTION  NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND  BECAUSE THE MINUTE THAT A REVOLUTION STARTS IT HAS TO LOOK  INTERNALLY AND THAT'S WHEN IT  IMPLODES AND HAS TO READJUST. SO THAT'S MY VIEW ON IRAN. ON THE ISSUE OF THE VIDEO, I  MEAN OBVIOUSLY I'M A DIRECT  DESCENDENT OF THE PROPHET SO I'M  TERRIBLY INSULTED BY THE VIDEO AND REFUSE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE  OBVIOUSLY THE WHOLE POINT OF THE  VIDEO WAS TO CREATE THIS  REACTION THAT UNFORTUNATELY  HAPPENED. AT THE SAME TIME, I'M COMPLETELY  AGAINST THAT TYPE OF REACTION. YOU DO NOT TAKE INNOCENT LIVES  INTO YOUR OWN HANDS. SO UNFORTUNATELY, THE PERSON  THAT WAS BEHIND THIS GOT AWAY  WITH EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS TRYING  TO DO. AND WE HAVE THIS CHAOS  THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT  THEN ALLOWS-- IT'S SO EASY IT  SEEMS--
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU. AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LOT  OF PEOPLE IN OUR PART OF THE  WORLD THAT ARE JUST WAITING FOR  AN EXCUSE TO LEAP ON TO THIS. SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS  TRYING TO FEED OFF OF EACH  OTHER, EXTREMISTS ON EITHER SIDE  THAT SORT OF IN A WAY LIVE OFF EACH OTHER.
Jon: AND IT'S THAT  SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT  MAKES FINDING STABILITY SO  DIFFICULT. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A  LITTLE BIT?
SURE.
Jon: IT'S FUNNY, WE SHOULD  HAVE DONE THIS ON THE SHOW. WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE MIDDLE  EAST ON THE WEB. (LAUGHTER)  SO WE'LL DO IT ON THE WEB. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  KING ABDULLAH OF JORDAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
