APRIL 24, 2010, FROM COME I DID CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOMEnb TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT WE'RE VERY EXCITED ONE OF OUR FAVORITE FORMER SECRETARY MADELEINE ALBRIGHT IS JOINING. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ONGOING SCANDAL AND THE SECRET SERVICE'S SHAH MAN IN AGAVES  DOWN IN CART HANEA. WHEN THEY TRAVELED EARLER THIS MONTH. A TEAM IS.
AS THE INVESTIGATION ENTERS ITS SECOND WEEK SIX OF 12 SECRET SERVICE AGENTS IMPLICATED  RESIGNED OR WERE FIRED. THERE'S WORD OF ANOTHER AGENT WHO HAS TAKEN A PROSTITUTE TO A SENSITIVE LOCATION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I WOULD ASSUME, GENERAL, IT'S STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. VIS-A-VIS PROSTITUTE AND THEIR LOCATIONS AND RESPECTIVE SENSITIVITY. NOBODY WANTS SOMEONE TO RUB THEIR ELBOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? THIS IS TAKING OUR FINEST POLITICAL REPORTERS ON A WHIRLWIND TOUR OF WHATEVER IS  SPANISH FOR MOWLIN ROUGE.
THE TOURIST TRADE HERE IS VERY POPULAR. YOU ARE GOING TO BE APPROACHED ON EVERY CORNER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LOT OF SINGLE SCANNEDLY CLAD WOMEN HANG OUT IN THE AREAS WHERE THE  SECRET SERVICE MEN WERE PARTYING.
Jon: WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THESE WOMEN SMELL AMAZING. AN INTOXICATING MIST OF LAVENDER AND ONE OTHER THING WE'VE FOUND HERE IS THAT BREAST GLITTER  DOESN'T COME OUT OF YOUR CLOTHES. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S LIKE IMPERIOUS TO LINT ROLLERS. THIS IS THE REPORTER FOR VERY LONELY PLANET. [ LAUGHTER ] AS ALL OF AS THE SCANDAL IS THE THING THAT AMAZED ME THE MOST CAME OUT AS A SIDE NOTE.
DAVID CHANEY A SECRET SERVICE SUPERVISOR FACES SCRUTINY FOR THIS PHOTO THAT REPORTEDLY  SURFACED ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE SHOWING HIM ON SARAH PALIN'S SECURITY DETAIL. HIS POST SAID I WAS REALLY CHECKING HER OUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT REALLY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU WERE CHECKING HER OUT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IT'S A SINGLE ENTENDRE, NOBODY THINKS  SHE'S A LIBRARY BOOK AND WE'RE CONFUSED. SECOND, HOW THE (bleep) DOES A SECRET SERVICE GUY HAVE A FACEBOOK BOOK WHERE HE POSTS  PICTURES OF WHO HE'S PROTECTING. CHECK IT OUT IT'S ME. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SECRET GUYS ON FOURSQUARE, TOO? JUST CHECKING IN AT THE PREVIOUS'S PREVIOUSLY UNDISCLOSED LOCATION. AS MUCH AS THIS SCANDAL --  [  APPLAUSE  ] -- LOOK AT ME THROWING INTERNET THINGS OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] AS MUCH AS THIS SCANDAL MAY INDICATE THE NEED FOR PROCEDURES AND CULTURE IN THE SECRET  SERVICE THE PROBLEM MAY BE WIDESPREAD.
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF THERE'S MORE WOMEN AS PART OF  THAT DETAIL IF THIS EVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
IT'S ONLY 11% OF THE AGENTS ARE WOMEN.
WE AGREE ON THIS IF THERE WERE MORE AGENTS ON THE GROUND MAYBE WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THIS.
THINK OF MONEY WE WOULD SAVE FROM PAYING THEM LESS. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR MORE ON THIS JEER JOINED WITH SAMANTHA BEE WHO IS IN CARTAGENA. SAM --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THEY ARE SUGGESTING THE WAY TO VIED THE SCANDALS ARE FOR THE SECRET SERVICE TO HIRE  MORE WOMEN. KEEPING WOMEN IN THE GROUP COPES A LID ON BAD BEHAVIOR.
WHAT Av: GREAT DEAL FOR WOMEN. DON'T BOTHER REFORMING YOUR AGENCY'S TRAINING PROGRAM OR STEAK A NO (bleep) ON FACEBOOK  RULE JUST HIRE A COUPLE OF FEMALE AGENTS IN CHARGE OF BUZZ KILL. OKAY, BOYS SPIT OUT YOUR BEERNZ PUT YOUR WHREEP AWAY. SPECIAL AGENT NAGATHA CHRISTY SON THE CASE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK, SAM, MEN ARE OFFENDED AS WELL. COLLINS AND MALONEY ARE IMP PLYING A GROUP OF MEN CAN'T GO AWAY TOGETHER AND NOT TRY TO  BANG ANYONE WITH 100 FEET.
YEAH, BUT THAT'S TRUE.
Jon: CAROLYN MALONEY IS PART OF MORNING CONGRESS SHL DELL DECONTAMINATION. THEY ARE 30% WOMEN IN. THE LAST THREE YEARS ALONE THEY'VE ABOUT FERGUSON P TWITTER DICK VAN PATTON AND TICKLE ME --
DID I GROPE A MALE STAFFER? YEAH, I DID. I TICKLED HIM SO HE COULDN'T BREATHE.
Jon: SO I GUESS WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF WOMEN THERE THE WHOLE DELEGATION WOULD DESCEND  INTO CHAI YOIS? IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT WOMEN DON'T LET LOOSE WHAT THEY ARE TRAVELING AS WELL AS MEN?
WELL, WOMEN HAVE BETTER FOCUS IN SELF CONTROL. FACT! OH, OKAY.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT, SAM?
NOTHING. DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jon: IS THAT JESSICA?
NO.
WHAT'Sï¿½r UP? JON, IT'S AMAZING!
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE, JON!
Jon: DONDE ETSA -- I'LL TELL YOU DONDE ESTA AQUI.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS CRAZY, JON.
Jon: ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T KNOW SHE'S TALKING ABOUT?
YES, BECAUSE SHE WAS (bleep) UP LAST NIGHT. JON, I HAVE SO MANY PICTURES.
DON'T YOU DARE!
RUN SLIDESHOW. [ LAUGHTER.
AWESOME CLIP. GOT A LITTLE HANDS-Y BUT WE SETTLED THE BEEF. WE TALKED IT OUT. EVERYONE WENT THEIR ACCEPT ARE RATE WAYS AND WE HEADED BACK TO THE BOOR, JON. IT WAS ALL GOOD.
Jon: SORRY WHO WAS THAT?
IT WAS OLD HITLER. JON, WE FOUND AND DRANK WITH OLD HITLER.
Jon: WHAT? I THOUGHT HE WAS IN ARGENTINA? WERE YOU PARTYING WITH OLD HITLER, SAM?
AFTER THE CAT TRANQUILIZERS I WAS PRETTY SURE HE WAS A HAD A LOOSE NATION.
THAT OLD HITLER (bleep) WAS REAL.
Jon: I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU LEVEL HEADED FEMALES TO COME HOME.

Jon: ALL RIGHT.
