Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ACTOR THE LEAD VOCALIST OF 30 SECONDS TO MARS HIS LATEST FILM IS "DALLAS BUYERS CLUB."
THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE IF IT'S HELPING PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW THERE AIN'T NO HELPING ME.
DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONNA STOP TRYING.
WHY ARE YOU SO GOOD TO ME? BLESS YOUR LITTLE HEART.
PROMISE ME YOU SHOW UP FOR THE REST --
I PROMISE YOU THAT I'LL TRY MY VERY BEST.
I WANT YOU TO MEAN IT.
Jon: HE'S VERY GOOD IN THIS. PLEASE WELCOME JARED LETO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SOAK IT IN BOY. SOAK IT IN. ENJOY THE FEELING. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHY DID YOU SIT DOWN?
Jon: I FEEL LIKE YOUR NARC OLDER BROTHER RIGHT NOW TRYING TO CONVINCE TO YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL. SIT. MY FRIEND --
YES.
Jon: WHAT A PERFORMANCE YOU GIVE IN THIS FILM AND A BEAUTIFUL FILM.
THANK YOU.
Jon: IT'S OUT. THEY CAN SEE IT.
YOU CAN SEE IT.
YOU CAN WALK TO A THEATER AND SEE IT.
Jon: YOU WON AN AWARD TODAY.
I DID.
Jon: THE NEW YORK CIRCLE -- CRITIC'S CIRCLE.
YEAH, I DID.
Jon: IS THAT A CEREMONY? DO THEY CALL YOU?
JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS -- I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. I KNOW NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] HE DIDN'T JUST TELL ME. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M A NEWS MAN! [LAUGHTER] BREAKING NEWS, YOU ARE AN AWARD WINNING ACTOR.
FINALLY. BUT, YEAH, I DID. THIS NEW YORK FILM CRITIC'S CIRCLE AWARD. IT'S QUITE AN HONOR, REALLY HUMBLING. I HADN'T MADE A FILM IN ALMOST SIX YEARS. TO COME BACK AND GET THIS LOVE AND SUPPORT IS NUTS.
Jon: YOU HADN'T MADE -- WAS THERE SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS STORY THAT YOU THOUGHT I NEED TO GET BACK IN THE GAME, OR HAD YOU DECIDED PRIOR TO THAT?
I THOUGHT I WOULD LOOK PRETTY GOOD IN A SKIRT.
Jon: AS MOST WOULD AGREE YOU PRETTY MUCH LOOK GOOD. I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS, SKIRT, BAG, TOP HAT, BEARD. I DOESN'T REALLY -- YOU KNOW, IT'S A NICE THING FOR YOU. THE THING THAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS. THEY DO A ROLE THEY HAVE TO MAYBE LOSE A LITTLE WEIGHT OR CHANGE -- YOU HAD TO DO ALL THESE THINGS.
YEAH.
Jon: BUT YOU HAD TO DO THEM IN THREE WEEKS. THAT SEEMS LIKE NOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PREPARATION TIME.
IT'S NOT. I LOST 30, 40 POUNDS.
Jon: SORRY?
I LOST 30, 40 POUNDS.
Jon: IN THREE WEEKS?
NO, THROUGH THE COURSE. I DID LOSE A LOT IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS. I STOPPED EATING.
Jon: SO THAT'S YOUR PLAN, DON'T EAT.
THE LESS YOU EAT THE BETTER AN ACTOR YOU ARE. I KEPT IT TO 300 OR 400 CALORIES A DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU SHOULD LAUGH.
Jon: THAT'S ONE CHEESE DOODLE. MY GOD, MAN, HOW DID YOU SURVIVE? AS YOU ARE WORKING BECAUSE THE DAYS ARE LONG. YOU ARE IN THIS CHARACTER WORK IT'S AN INTENSE EMOTIONAL MOVIE PLAYING THESE SCENES. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO PASS OUT AT SOME POINT? DON'T YOU NEED THE ENERGY?
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT. YOU LOSE THE WEIGHT. YOU STOP EATING NOT BECAUSE OF WAY IT LOOKS. IT'S GREAT. IT'S A BENEFIT. THEY JUST LAUGHED, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] I'M ON TO YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT CHANGES THE WAY YOU TALK, THE WAY YOU WALK, THE WAY PEOPLE TREAT YOU. IT CHANGES YOUR ENERGY. YOU DO IT FOR THE WAY IT EFFECTS YOU.
Jon: AND DID THAT THEN -- DID YOU FIND PEOPLE BELIEVED YOU TO BE MORE FRAGILE?
YEAH. I MEAN THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO PUT IT. PROVIDED A LOT OF FRAGILITY.
Jon: AND THAT -- WHEN YOU WERE DONE WITH THAT PROCESS --
YEAH.
Jon: HOW DO YOU COME  BACK?
THERAPY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT STAYS WITH YOU.
IT DOES. THIS FILM PARTICULARLY I PLAY A -- YOU SAW A CLIP SO I DON'T HAVE TO SAY BUT IT WAS A REALLY UNIQUE SITUATION. SO THERE WAS A VOICE, THERE WAS A WALK, A TALK A WHOLE THING. IT TAKES A WHILE TO LOSE THE MUSCLE MEMORY. I STAYED IN CHARACTER THE WHOLE TIME.
Jon: AT NIGHT, LIKE WHEN YOU ARE NOT ON SET?
YOU CAN'T REALLY LET GO OF THAT. YOU ARE CONSTANTLY IN THAT PLACE. AT LEAST I WAS. I NEEDED TO BE THERE IN ORDER TO DO WHAT I HAD TO DO.
Jon: DID YOU NOT -- THE HARDEST THING I THINK FOR ME OTHER THAN OBVIOUSLY BEING A GOOD ACTOR -- [LAUGHTER] WOULD BE WHEN NOT WORKING, NOT DOING FOODSTUFF. SO MUCH OF MY DOWNTIME IS FOOD BASED. IT'S BASED ON LIKE -- I'M GOING TO SIT, SPORTS CENTER IS ON AND THAT LOOKS LIKE A PIZZA I'M GOING TO HAVE SPORTS CENTER AND PIZZA.
YOU GET AN EMPTY LIFE QUICKLY. WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE FILM BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE LEFT IS YOUR WORK.
Jon: DID YOU GIVE UP -- NO MUSIC? NO NOTHING?
I WAS FOCUSED ON THE FILM. WE SHOT IT IN 25 DAYS. IT WAS QUICK.
Jon: THE BAND IS COMING BACK. THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY OUT TODAY ABOUT THE BATTLE WITH YOUR RECORD LABEL?
YEAH IN WHICH THEY SUED US FOR $30 MILLION AFTER WE FOUND OUT WE SOLD MILLIONS OF ALBUMS AND NOT ONLY WERE WE NOT GOING TO BE PAID A PENNY WE WERE MILLIONS IN DEBT. WE LOOKED INTO IT AND THEY PROMPTLY SUED US FOR $30 MILLION. WE FOUGHT THEM FOR A FEW YEARS AND FILMED IT ALL.
Jon: WHEN THEY INFORMED YOU YOU SOLD MILLIONS OF RECORDS AND OWED THEM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND THEY SAID, OH YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT?
THEY TALK ABOUT THIS CRAZY BUSINESS AND THAT UNHOLY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ART AND COMMERCE.
Jon: THE RECORD COMPANIES ARE GOING AWAY. THE DISTRIBUTION MODEL, THEY'RE GOING TO BE A THING OF THE PAST. THAT'S WHY THEY WANT $30 MILLION BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS THEY ARE OUT THE DOOR.
FORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T. WE MADE AN ALBUM THAT IS CALLED THIS IS WAR THAT DID REALLY WELL, WENT ON TO SELL MILLIONS OF ALBUMS AND THE GUY AT THE HELM OF THE COMPANY LOST CONTROL HELOF THE COMPANY AND LOST $1ROL BILLION OR MAYBE MORE IN THE PROCESS. I JUST GAVE AWAY THE ENDING.
Jon: IS THAT HOW THE MOVIE ENDS?
YEAH.
Jon: DALLAS BUYERS CLUB IN THEATERS NOW.
