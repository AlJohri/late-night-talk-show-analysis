(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT! SHE IS THE JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR REPRESENTING THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "OFF THE SIDELINES:  RAISE YOUR VOICE, CHANGE THE WORLD." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ HELLO! HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE! (APPLAUSE) WE HAVE YOUR BRAND-NEW BOOK THERE, KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. "OFF THE SIDELINES." THE IDEA OF BEING -- THE SUGGESTION BEING PEOPLE, WOMEN IN PARTICULAR AS YOU WRITE THE BOOK, THEY NEED TO GET INVOLVED, THEY NEED TO GET THERE AND START CHANGING THINGS FOR THE BETTER.
RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT ASKING WOMEN TO BE HEARD ON THE ISSUES THEY CARE ABOUT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE MORE WOMEN WHO TELL THEIR STORIES, THE MORE WOMEN WHO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR P.T.A. OR THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR EVEN IN CONGRESS...
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT OUTCOMES WILL BE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THE COUNTRY STRONGER.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WRITE -- AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS -- YOU MADE A VERY CONSCIOUS DECISION IN YOUR LIFE THAT IT LACKED THE MEANING THAT YOU WANTED IT TO HAVE.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND, SO, YOU MADE THAT DIRECTIONAL CHANGE. VERY PURPOSEFUL.
YEAH, SO I WAS JUST SITTING AT MY BIG LAW FIRM PUSHING PAPER, AND I WATCHED HILLARY CLINTON GO TO CHINA AND GIVE HER BIG SPEECH ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I FELT I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING, AND SO THAT'S WHAT REALLY MOTIVATED ME TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS AND I WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND, YOU KNOW, I HAD GREAT ROLE MODELS IN MY LIFE. NOT ONLY WAS HILLARY CLINTON ONE, BUT MY MOTHER WAS A WOMAN WHO WORKED AND TOOK CARE OF US AT HOME.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I JUST REMEMBER DAYS WHEN SHE'S GOT HER PHONE IN ONE HAND DEALING WITH A LAW CASE AND COOKING DINNER AND SWEEPING THE FLOOR AT THE SAME TIME.
Jon: HOW MANY ARMS DID YOUR MOTHER HAVE?
SEVERAL. SHE WAS THE QUEEN OF MULTI-TASKING.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT IT GAVE ME THIS ROLE MODEL AND THIS NOTION THAT YOU CAN BE A GOOD MOM AND DO A JOB AT WORK WELL AT THE SAME TIME, AND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE AND YOU CAN DO BOTH...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND YOU CAN GIVE BACK TO YOUR COMMUNITY. I ALSO LEARNED FROM HER, SHE SPENT HER FREE TIME LEARNING KARATE AND SHE EARNED A SECOND DEGREE BLACK BELT BY THE TIME SHE WAS MY AGE.
IS YOUR MOM WONDER WOMAN?
SORT OF.
Jon: SHE HAS A SECOND DEGREE BLACK BELT IN KARATE? AND SHE'S A LAWYER?
YES. YES. AND SHE'D COME HOME WITH BRUISES ON HER ARMS. AND I THOUGH, MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BUT IT WAS WHAT SHE LIKED TO DO. SHE ENJOYED IT. AND I PLAY TENNIS, SO YOU KNOW,  DIFFERENT. BUT I DO SOMETHING NOW IN MY LIFE. THE BOOK IS ABOUT -- THE REASON WHY I TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE THESE PERSONAL STORIES...
Jon: RIGHT.
TO TALK ABOUT MY ROLE MODELS IS BECAUSE I WANTED WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THESE STORIES AND MY GOAL IS TO INSPIRE EVEN ONE GIRL, ONE WOMAN TO FIGHT FOR THE ISSUES SHE CARES ABOUT...
Jon: RIGHT.
WHATEVER IT IS, AND TO SHOW HER THAT, YOU KNOW, I STRUGGLED IN THE SAME WAY...
Jon: RIGHT.
I SUFFERED SOME OF THE SAME CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND THAT EVEN DESPITE THAT AND WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING THROUGH, THEY CAN TOO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN STILL NEED THAT ENCOURAGEMENT? BECAUSE THERE ISN'T, YOU KNOW, THAT IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, A MAN WOULD WRITE A BOOK AND SAY, I JUST WANT MEN TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY MATTER, TOO.
YES, THEY DO.
Jon: YOU KNOW, MEN WOULD NEVER -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THERE IS THAT SENSE, MEN HAVE ALREADY CONTROLLED EVERYTHING FOR SO LONG THAT THEY NEVER NEED THAT EXTRA PUSH AND YOU WOULD THINK, AT THIS POINT, WITH ALL THAT WOMEN HAVE ACCOMPLISHED, THAT THAT WOULD BE CLEAR, AND YET IT STILL CAN NEVER BE SAID ENOUGH. YOU CAN BE HEARD.
AND YOU HEAR IT A LOT. YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN I DO? I'M JUST A COLLEGE STUDENT, I'M JUST A YOUNG WOMAN.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT I'VE WATCHED TWO WOMEN WALK  INTO MY OFFICE  ASK FOR A MEETING. THESE TWO WOMEN, ANDREA AND ANNIE, AND SAY WE WANT TO MEET WITH A SENATOR. AND SO WE MADE A PRIORITY AND MET WITH THEM, AND THEY TOLD ME THEIR STORY ABOUT HOW THEY WERE RAPED ON CAMPUS...
Jon: OH MY GOD.
THEY REPORTED IT AND NOT BELIEVED, AND THEN RETALIATED AGAINST BY THEIR UNIVERSITIES.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THOSE WOMEN ARE NOW CREATING A NATIONAL MOVEMENT AND SPEAKING UP ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND DEMANDING ACTION BY THE ADMINISTRATIONS AT THOSE SCHOOLS. THOSE GIRLS ARE CHANGING THE WORLD.
Jon: WELL, EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO HERE'S, I MEAN, NOW TAKE THAT STORY, YOU WERE IN CONGRESS AND INTRODUCE A BILL ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY...
YEAH.
Jon: TO CHANGE THE CULTURE. AND THIS IS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THAT GETS FILIBUSTERED...
CORRECT.
Jon: AND THAT CAN'T GET THROUGH. I MEAN, SO THE IDEA THEY'RE DOING IT -- HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT -- WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT CAN'T EVEN PROTECT THE WOMEN WHO ARE IN OUR OWN MILITARY?
WELL, THE MESSAGE OF THE BOOK IS NOT TO GIVE UP, IS THAT...
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, THESE STORIES MATTER. YOUR PERSONAL STORIES, WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO REPEAL DON'T ASK DON'T TELL, AND YOU'RE TELLING YOUR STORY ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO HAVE TO LIE TO EVERYONE IN YOUR LIFE ABOUT SERVING IN THE MILITARY...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND HAVING TO HIDE WHO YOU LOVE. OR WHETHER IT'S ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY AND TELLING YOUR COMMANDER AND YOUR COMMANDER SAYING IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S ASSURANCE TO WOMEN WHO READ IT TO SAY KEEPING FOCUSED ON WHAT MATTERS TO YOU, FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AND, YOU KNOW THERE'S HEARTBREAKING STORIES IN THERE, TOO, LIKE THE MOM WHO LOST HER CHILD BECAUSE OF A DROP-SIDE CRIB, BUT THOSE CRIBS WERE BANNED WITHIN NINE MONTHS BECAUSE PARENTS SPOKE UP AND SAID THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO IT'S AN INTIMATE CONVERSATION WITH WOMEN ABOUT THINGS WE CARE ABOUT AND I INCLUDE LOTS OF DETAILS ABOUT THE EVERYDAY STRUGGLES I HAVE FROM JUST MAKING LUNCHES IN THE MORNING, GETTING BREAKFAST ON THE TABLE AND GETTING OUT THE DOOR IN TIME WITH THE SOCCER UNIFORM SO THAT ANY MOM READING THE BOOK CAN SAY, OH WOW, SHE DOES SOME OF THE SAME STUFF I DO...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEY CAN SEE THEMSELVES IN THOSE CHALLENGES. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE REASON I BRING THE EXAMPLES UP IS BECAUSE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WOMEN FACE ARE MUCH HARDER. YOU KNOW, I HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN MY JOB AND --
Jon: SURE.
BUT THE LADY WHO'S GOING TO...
Jon: AND YOU HAVE A JOB.
AND I HAVE A JOB...
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...
AND I'M WELL PAID.
Jon: SOME WOMEN LIVE IN POVERTY. THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.
WE TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. WE TALK ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE. BUT THE LADY WHO'S GOING TO CLEAN THIS STUDIO TONIGHT, SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY. SHE HAS TO WORK THE HOURS SHE'S ASKED TO WORK.
Jon: I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YOU.
SHE HAS FLEXIBILITY?
Jon: NO, WE HAVEN'T CLEANED THIS STUDIO... THERE IS NO WOMAN WHO DOES THAT. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WE COME BACK, THOUGH, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE PUT IN WOMEN'S WAY. BECAUSE IT COULDN'T BE MORE APROPOS. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SEEING IN THIS RAY RICE CASE, YOU'RE SEEING IT IN HARASSMENTS YOU DETAIL IN THE BOOK THAT OCCURED FOR YOU.
YES.
YOU'RE SEEING IT IN THE PRESIDENT NOT BACKING YOUR BILL ON SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. WE'LL BE BACK, SENATOR GILLIBRAND, JUST ONE SECOND.
