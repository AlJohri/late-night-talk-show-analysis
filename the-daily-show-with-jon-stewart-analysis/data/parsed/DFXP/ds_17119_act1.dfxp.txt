Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO. WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE FROM THE SAME STATE AS THE FIRST HOOTER. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THIS MORNING'S NEWS OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT. A DECISION REGARDING ARIZONA'S LANDMARK IMMIGRATION LAW SB1070. YOU'LL RECALL THE LAW REQUIRED ARIZONA POLICE TO ASK ANYONE THEY STOPPED WHO THEY THEN  SUSPECT OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION PAPERS. CAVEAT BEING AS LONG AS SOME OF THE TIME THEY PRETEND THEY THOUGHT THE PERSON MIGHT BE AN  ILLEGAL CANADIAN. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGED THE LAW. ARIZONA JAN BREWER MAINTAINED IT WAS ALL CONSTITUTIONAL. LET'S SEE WHO WON.
IT IS A VICTORY FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
I THINK THIS IS A VICTORY FOR ARIZONA.
VICTORY FOR JAN BREWER. Jon: A VICTORY FOR OBAMA, ARIZONA AND GOVERNOR BREWER. A WIN-WIN-WIN. WHO LOST HERE?
BIG DEFEAT FOR THE PRESIDENT. THIS IS A HUGE BLOW TO ARIZONA.
A PROFOUND DEFEAT FOR GOVERNOR BREWER.
Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP] WITH ME? DEFEAT FOR THE PRESIDENT, ARIZONA AND GOVERNOR BREWER. AS ALWAYS, NEWS NETWORKS, YOUR ANALYSIS IS SPOT-ON DEAD-WRONG. ACTUALLY I CAN UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S CONFUSION. THE VERDICT WAS MIXED. THE COURT FOUND THREE OF THE ARIZONA LAW'S FOUR PROVISIONS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IT LEFT INTACT A PART SAYING POLICE CAN CHECK IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT ONLY FOR PEOPLE THEY  STOPPED FOR OTHER REASONS. BUT IT ALSO SAID THAT PROVISION COULD BE CHALLENGED AT THE STATE LEVEL. I GUESS THERE'S NO ONE EVERYONE AGREES EITHER WON OR LOST.
IT'S A TERRIBLE DAY FOR ROMNEY.
A BAD DAY FOR MITT ROMNEY. THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST OF ALL OUTCOMES IF YOU'RE MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: OH, PLEASE. ACTUALLY I THINK THE WORST OF ALL OUTCOMES FOR MITT ROMNEY WOULD BE IF JESUS COMES BACK BUT  SAYS HE LOVES COFFEE AND SWEARING. THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR ROMNEY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  MY NAME IS JESUS, GIVE ME A  [BLEEP] LATTE: SEND YOUR LETTERS TO BRIAN WILLIAMS. CARE OF NBC. ACTUALLY, TODAY'S RULING HIGHLIGHTS A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR MITT ROMNEY. DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY A BIT OF A HARD-LINER ON THE WHOLE IMMIGRATION ISSUE
THE RIGHT COURSE FOR AMERICA IS TO DROP THESE LAWSUITS AGAINST ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES  THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE JOB BARACK OBAMA ISN'T DOING
THE ANSWER IS SELF DEPORTATION WHICH IS PEOPLE DECIDE THEY CAN DO BETTER BY  GOING HOME BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK HERE. I'LL COMPLETE THE FENCE, MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH BORDER PATROL AGENTS
Jon: I WILL USE THE BANKS OF THE RIO GRANDE AND THEN I WILL TILT AMERICA SLIGHTLY UP ABOUT  38 DEGREES. THAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY WILL SLIDE. IT'S WHY MITT ROMNEY FACED A BIT OF A CHALLENGE WHEN HE AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA BOTH  SPOKE LAST WEEK AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LATINO-ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS NELEO AS  WE FOUND OUT IN ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF OUR LATIN GRAMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES, THE  PANDERERS OR LOS PANDEROS. YES. YES. NOW, THE GREETING AT THESE EVENTS IS EVERYTHING. YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION. FIRST UP, MITT ROMNEY
I COME TO YOU AS A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. OF AMERICA.
Jon: OOO. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT WAS A PLEA FOR UNITY AS MUCH AS A GUY ADDRESSING A ROOM OR HE'S NOT  SURE EVERYBODY SPEAKS ENGLISH. ARE YOU COMFORT-A-BLE YOUR CHAIR-O... CHAIR-O. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE OBAMA'S OPEN
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK AT NALEO. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: NOW I KNOW WHY THE ECONOMY ISN'T DOING SO WELL. HE SPENT THE PAST THREE YEARS DOING ROSETTA STONE TAPES. FIRST ONE GOES TO OBAMA. NEXT UP, CONNECTION TO AND COMFORT WITH THE COMMUNITY. MR. PRESIDENT?
I WANT TO THANK THE SECRETARY FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND FOR HER HARD WORK. SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST LABOR SECRETARIES WE HAVE EVER HAD, AND SHE IS THINKING ABOUT YOU EACH AND EVERY DAY.
Jon: WOW. SOME OF MY BEST SECRETARIES OF LABOR ARE LATINO. WELL DONE. ROMNEY?
THROUGHOUT MY CAMPAIGN I'VE OFTEN HAD THE CHANCE TO SPEAK  ABOUT MY DAD AND HOW PROUD I AM OF HIM. HE WAS BORN TO PARENTS, AMERICAN PARENTS LIVING IN MEXICO.
Jon: BING, BING, BING, BING, MY DAD IS MEXICAN-ISH. MEXICAN-ISH. NOTE TO SELF. THE JEWISH POTATO TREAT WITH THE FLAVOR OF THE SOUTHWEST, I CALL IT THE MEXICAN-ISH. I'LL MAKE NOTHING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT ROUND CLEARLY GOES TO ROMNEY. WE MOVE NOW TO OUR FINAL ROUND WORTH DOUBLE POINTS. THE LEGISLATIVE PANDEROS. BARACK OBAMA
ON FRIDAY WE ANNOUNCED WE'RE LIFTING THE SHADOW OF DEPORTATION FROM DESERVING YOUNG  PEOPLE WHO WERE BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AS CHILDREN. THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Jon: THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ONE WEEK BEFORE COMING HERE WAS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO IT. GOT TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT. MITT ROMNEY
SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED IF I WILL LET STAND THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE ANSWER IS THAT I WILL PUT IN PLACE MY OWN LONG-TERM SOLUTION THAT WILL REPLACE AND SUPERSEDE  THE PRESIDENT'S TEMPORARY MEASURE.
Jon: SUPERSEDING THE PRESIDENT'S TEMPORARY MEASURE. WOW. HERE'S THE ONLY WAY HE COULD HAVE SAID THAT TO LESS EXCITEMENT. LIKE A TATTOO, AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS GET ON A SPRING BREAK MEXICAN BENDER, YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT IT IS YET. YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE IT. BUT IT WILL BE PERMANENT. ROMNEY 2012. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
