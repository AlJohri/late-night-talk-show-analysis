[ APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME BACK. RECENTLY MANY AMERICAN POLICE  DEPARTMENTS HAVE FACED  CRITICISM FOR EXCESSIVE USE OF  FORCE. HERE WITH MORE IS SENIOR MY WIFE CORRESPONDENT, SAMANTHA B.
THANK YOU.  [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH, JASON. IT IS A NATIONAL  EMBARRASSMENT. A DISGUSTED PUBLIC HAS POURED  INTO THE STREETS DEMANDING  CHANGE FROM THE HIDEOUS STATUS  QUO. AND YET STILL, THESE TESTOSTERONE FUELED OAFS WHO HAVE PROVEN THEMSELVES UNFIT FOR THEIR JOBS ARE KEPT ON AND EVEN PROMOTEED TO POSITIONS  WHERE THEY CAN DO EVEN MORE  HARM.
WE'RE, WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT POLICE HERE, RIGHT?
POLICE? OH MY GOD, NO. NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU, YOU (BLEEP) ASSHOLE. SITTING IN THIS SEAT. THIS.
WE AGREED ON THIS. WE AGREED -- I WOULD DO ACT ONE, YOU WOULD DO ACT TWO. WE, YOU KNOW, WOULD MAYBE FLIP FOR THE INTERVIEW.
YEAH, I SHOULD BE IN THAT CHAIR RIGHT NOW.
OKAY. WAIT, WAIT. HOLD ON. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S FINE, BUT CAN WE JUST SHOW A LITTLE PICTURE OF HOW SAM LOOKED WHEN, YOU KNOW, WE HEARD THAT ONE OF US WOULD HAVE TO HOST? YEAH, RIGHT THERE.
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS?
WHAT?
THAT WAS JOY VOMIT. I WAS GOING TO GRAB THE BRASS RING TODAY. ANYWAY, WHATEVER, WHATEVER, WHATEVER BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE IN THAT  CHAIR REMOLDING JON'S ASS  GROOVE, I WAS OUT DOING SOME  REAL REPORTING ON POLICE  SHOOTINGS. ROLL THE PIECE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT LINE.
YEAH. (BLEEP) YOU.  ROLL THE PIECE.
THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION LATELY ABOUT THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE BY OUR NATION'S LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, ONE  THING ALL AMERICANS NEED TO DO  IS LOOK AT THE DATA.
ONE OF THE VITAL PIECES OF  INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO  HAVE IS HOW OFTEN THE  GOVERNMENT KILLS PEOPLE.
CRIMINOLOGIST AND AUTHOR,  DAVID KLINGER. FIRST OF ALL, ARE SHOOTINGS OF CIVILIANS BY THE POLICE, INCREASING OR DECREASING?
IT'S TOO HARD TO KNOW.
OKAY, IT'S NOT THAT HARD. INCREASING MEANS IT'S GOING UP, AND DECREASING MEANS GOING DOWN.
WE HAVE NO IDEA.
OKAY. THAT'S PROBABLY A MISTAKE. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF A DATABASE.
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION HAS A COUNT THAT THEY PUT OUT EVERY YEAR. IT'S SOMETHING CALLED THE  UNIFORM CRIME REPORT, BUT IT'S  SO FAR OFF, THAT IT REALLY ISN'T USABLE.
HOW OFF WOULD YOU SAY THE  NUMBERS ARE?
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WILDLY INACCURATE TO ASTRONOMICALLY INACCURATE.
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. POLICE KEEPS STATS ON EVERYTHING. WAIT, SO BACK IT UP FOR A MINUTE. HOW MANY BICYCLES ARE STOLEN  EVERY YEAR IN THIS COUNTRY?
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SOME THOUSAND.
HOW MANY HOME BURGLARIES ARE THERE?
800,000 OR SO.
DO POLICE KEEP RECORDS OF HOW MANY BULLETS ARE DISCHARGED ON A MONTHLY BASIS?
ALL MAJOR POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO TRACK THAT, YES MA'AM.
OKAY, DO THE POLICE KEEP A RECORD OF HOW MANY BULLETS ARE DISCHARGED IN THE DIRECTION OF  CIVILIANS?
YES.
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SHOT BY  COPS ANNUALLY?
NO IDEA.
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST (BLEEP) WITH ME. OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU WANT STATS ON POLICE SHOOTINGS, THEN YOU'VE GOT TO ASK A COP. AND WHO BETTER THAN FORMER NYPD COMMISSIONER BERNIE KERIK.
IF YOU LOOKED AT THE OVERALL DATA, I WOULD SAY THAT POLICE SHOOTINGS HAVE, THEY'VE PROBABLY DECREASED.
WHERE CAN I FIND THAT DATABASE?
WELL IF YOU GO IN THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE NUMBERS.
BUT WHAT ABOUT NATIONALLY?
POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE  MANDATED BY LAW TO PRODUCE  THIS MATERIAL TO THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
HE WAS RIGHT. THE DOJ WAS ORDERED TO KEEP A RECORD OF POLICE SHOOTINGS BACK IN 1994 THANKS TO A LAW PASSED BY OUR METICULOUS CONGRESS.
BUT IT WAS NOT CAREFULLY  CRAFTED. THERE'S NO STATUTORY AUTHORITY  THAT REQUIRES ANY LOCAL POLICE  AGENCY OR ANY STATE POLICE  AGENCY TO REPORT ANYTHING.
SO BASICALLY IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HEY GUYS, IT'S SHELLY FROM THE UNIFORM CRIME REPORT.  I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU  COULD SEND ME THE STATS AND LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SHOT DEAD OR WHATEVER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IF YOU'VE GOT TIME. OKAY? CATCH YOU LATER.
THAT'S NOT A TERRIBLE APPROXIMATION.
THANK YOU. HERE'S THE THING, NOBODY IS REQUIREED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING OF.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M  CONFIDENT IT GOES SOMEWHERE IN  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
WELL THAT DATA GOES SOMEWHERE. IT GOES LIKE THIS. POOF! AND THEN IT JUST DISPERSES  INTO THE WIND. IT'S ONE SIMPLE STATISTIC. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF  FAMOUS STATISTICIAN. OH, MY GOD. OH MY GOD. NATE SILVER. THANK GOD. OKAY, YOU'RE A STATISTICS DORK. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SHOT AND KILLED LAST YEAR BY THE POLICE?
I DON'T, THOSE STATISTICS JUST DON'T EXIST.
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A  DORK?
I WOULDN'T USE THAT TERM.
OKAY, WELL, I WOULD. DORK. MAYBE IT WAS TIME I GOT THE  FBI TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. AND I KNEW JUST HOW TO GET  THEIR ATTENTION. OH, THEY'RE ALREADY HERE. BUYS, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. OH, MY GOD. AHHH. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY POLICE SHOOTINGS THERE ARE -- OW, OW, YOU STEPPED ON MY BOOB!
IT WAS TIME TO TURN MY MOST  TRUSTED ADVISER.
YOU WILL MEET A SMALL, MALE DORK.
UGH, I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO NATE SILVER. GOD! I LOOKED EVERYWHERE. THE NATIONAL SHERIFFS'  ASSOCIATION. THE GAO. THE CDC. WIKIPEDIA. IMDB, GRINDR. BUT JUST WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP, I DISCOVERED A REPORTER WHOSE WEBSITE WAS CROWDSOURCING A NATIONAL DATABASE OF POLICE SHOOTINGS. FINALLY!
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE  NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED BY  POLICE.
OH MY GOD, WHY AM I EVEN HERE? HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THREE DIFFERENT HANKS FROM BREAKING BAD DIDN'T HAVE THE NATIONAL STATISTICS? AND THIS GUY HAD ONLY COUNTED  UP TO NEVADA.
8.7% OF TOTAL HOMICIDES IN  NEVADA ARE COMMITTED BY  POLICE.
SO WHAT DOES THE NEVADA  POLICE SAY WHEN YOU TOLD THEM  THIS?
NOTHING.
WHAT POSSIBLE REASONS COULD  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO  HIDE THE NUMBER OF TIME THEY'VE KILLED  CITIZENS? I JUST ANSWERED THAT QUESTION IN  MY HEAD AS IT WAS COMING OUT  OF MY MOUTH. NEVER MIND. YOU KNOW, NO MOM WANTS TO THINK THEIR CHILD WILL GROW UP TO BECOME JUST ANOTHER STATISTIC. THANKFULLY GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR LAWS THERE'S NO CHANCE OF THAT EVER HAPPENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAMANTHA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YES, EXCELLENT REPORT. YOU DID A GREAT JOB. [ APPLAUSE ] YES, YOU ARE A WONDERFUL WOMAN.
IT WAS AN EXCELLENT REPORT, BUT YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO LOSE IT.
THANK YOU. YEAH, YEAH. I'M NOT LOSING ANYTHING. I'M CHAINED TO THE (BLEEP) DESK.
OKAY.
I'M HERE TO THE BITTER END. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
