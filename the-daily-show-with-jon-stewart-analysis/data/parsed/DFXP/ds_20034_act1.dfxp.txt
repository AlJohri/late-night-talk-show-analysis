FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD VIEW IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT. WE'VE GOT A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT. THE FABULOUS DIRECTOR KATHRYN BIGELOW WILL BE JOINING US AND ALSO JUAN ZARATE. THEY ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A FILM THAT KATHRYN MADE ABOUT THE ILLEGAL IVORY TRADE. IT'S A FASCINATING STORY. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH BIG NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON.
THE WORLD IS BRACING FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SENATE C.I.A. TORTURE REPORT. THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY BIG DEAL.
Jon: IT'S A BIG DEAL! THAT'S WHY THEY MADE IT A CHRISTMAS RELEASE! THIS REPORT IS THE "FROZEN" OF SENATE INTELLIGENCE C.I.A. CLANDESTINE REDACTED TORTURE REPORTS! ♪ LET ME GO  ♪ LET ME GO ♪ ♪ DON'T HOLD ME BACK ANYMORE   I KID, OF COURSE. NOBODY'S ELECTROCUTING OLAF FOR INFORMATION BECAUSE HE WOULD MELT. WHY TO WE NEED TO SEE THIS STUPID OLD BORING CIA TORTURE REPORT ANYWAY? WE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS YEARS AGO!
THIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TORTURE PEOPLE.
Jon: BOOM! POW! IF THAT FAMED PAINTER OF CATS AND FEET SAYS WE DIDN'T TORTURE, WHO ARE WE DO DISAGREE? MY GUESS IS THAT SENATE "REPORT" IS JUST A SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER THAT SAYS, THIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TORTURE PEOPLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY FEET? (LAUGHTER) BUT ALRIGHT, FINE. LET'S LET DIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE'S OUTGOING CHAIR TRY TO MAKE A MEAL OUT OF A MORSEL. WHAT'S IN YOUR SO-CALLED REPORT?
C.I.A. DETAINEES KEPT IN COMPLETE DARKNESS, SHACKLED IN ISOLATED CELLS WITH LOUD NOISE OR MUSIC AND ONLY A BUCKET TO USE FOR HUMAN WASTE. STRIPPED NAKED, PHYSICALLY STRUCK, VARIOUS PAINFUL STRESS POSITIONS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. DEPRIVED OF SLEEP FOR DAYS.  UP TO 180 HOURS. HANDS TIED TOGETHER OVER THEIR HEADS, CHAINED TO THE CEILING. ROUGH TAKE-DOWNS, GRABBED FROM A CELL, CLOTHES CUT OFF, HOODED, AND DRAGGED UP AND DOWN A DIRT HALLWAY.
THE CASE IN WHICH A PRISONER'S LUNCH TRAY CONSISTING OF HUMMUS, PASTA AND NUTS WERE PUREED AND RECTALLY INFUSED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: COULD I, COULD I GET A REACTION SHOT OF HOW I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW? (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. I MEAN, I JUST MADE THIS MOVIE ABOUT A GUY WHO TRIUMPHS OVER THE INHUMAN CONDITIONS IN HIS IMPRISONMENT IN AN AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRY, AND I DON'T THINK THEY DID HALF OF THAT [BLEEP] TO HIM. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY WORSE BECAUSE MAZIAR WAS COMPLETELY INNOCENT.
OF THE 119 INDIVIDUALS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY THE CIA DURING THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM, THE COMMITTEE FOUND THAT AT LEAST 26 WERE WRONGFULLY HELD.
Jon: THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS COMPLETELY INNOCENT. CAN I SEE THAT FOOTAGE AGAIN? CAN I SEE THAT FOOTAGE AGAIN? WHAT THE HELL?  HOW DID -- WHO AUTHORIZED -- WHY DID WE -- OKAY. OKAY. DID WE KNOW THAT WE WERE DOING THIS?
THE C.I.A. SYSTEMATICALLY LIED TO ITSELF, TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND TO CONGRESS.
Jon: THE C.I.A. WITHHELD STUFF FROM THE SENATORS.
BASICALLY THE C.I.A. LIED TO EVERYONE.
THE REPORT SAYS THE TECHNIQUES DIDN'T PRODUCE THE RESULTS THAT REALLY MATTERED TO SAVE LIVES.
THE C.I.A. DIDN'T TELL PRESIDENT BUSH ABOUT THE FULL NATURE OF THE E.I.T.s TILL APRIL OF 2006.
Jon: OH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS WHY BUSH WAS OUT THERE SAYING THAT WE DIDN'T TORTURE. HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT! I MEAN, THIS WHOLE THING -- WAIT A MINUTE, WHEN DID THEY TELL HIM?
APRIL 2006.
Jon: AND WHEN DID HE ANGRILY AND DEFENSIVELY SAY, WE DON'T TORTURE PEOPLE?
THIS GOVERNMENT DOES NOT TORTURE PEOPLE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: NO, NO OKAY! OKAY! OKAY! ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT. NOW, HOLD ON! ALL I HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHICH STATEMENT CAME FIRST. ALL RIGHT. HOLD ON A SECOND. ALL RIGHT. I'M SO BAD WITH THE AUGHTS. CARRY THE 06 -- WHY IS 6 AFRAID OF 7? BECAUSE 7, 8, 9 -- WAIT A SECOND -- CAN WE GET POPE GREGORY ON THE LINE? I GOT A QUESTION ABOUT HIS ORDERED SYSTEM OF DATES. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. SO THE C.I.A. KNEW, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH KNEW, I'M ASSUMING THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE KNEW. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANK GOD THERE'S A NEW EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN CHARGE NOW WHO MADE IT A PRIORITY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL CHAPTER OF THE MOST TRANSPARENT ADMINISTRATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN CHAIRWOMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO DELAY THE REPORT'S RELEASE.
THERE ARE THE 9,000 DOCUMENTS THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO GET ITS HANDS ON AND THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WON'T GIVE THOSE UP. THE WHITE HOUSE SO FAR ISN'T MAKING THEM.
Jon: OKAY, BUT TO BE FAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, HE WAS GREAT ON COLBERT LAST NIGHT. (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, MY GUESS IS, MY GUESS IS SCHEDULING WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE. LOOK, MR. PRESIDENT, YOU BETTER GET IT IN TONIGHT BECAUSE WHEN THIS REPORT HITS, TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, COME TUESDAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE SLOW JAMMING (BLEEP) TILL 2016. ALRIGHT, ANYTHING ELSE?
THE CONTRACTORS PROVIDED THE OFFICIAL EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER DETAINEES' PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES ALLOWED FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF THE ENHANCED TECHNIQUES. EVEN FOR SOME DETAINEES, THEY THEMSELVES WERE INTERROGATING, A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND A VIOLATION OF PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINES.
Jon: CONFLICT OF INTEREST? AFTER THE OTHER (BLEEP) WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT? I'M ACTUALLY GLAD YOU THREW IN A LITTLE COMMON EVERY DAY BUREAUCRATIC CORRUPTION TO TRY AND BRING ANOTHER FLAVOR TO THIS DELUGE OF DEPRAVITY. YEAH, YEAH WE FED GUYS THROUGH THEIR (BLEEP). BUT DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE NEPOTISM. I MEAN, AND THE OFFICE SUPPLIES, YOU'D THINK POST ITS GREW ON TREES THE WAY THESE GUYS WOULD EH -- WELL, THIS IS A BLOCKBUSTER AND I'LL BET TONIGHT THERE ARE A LOT OF POWERFUL PEOPLE IN LANGLEY AND ELSEWHERE WHO WOULD LOVE TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE NAMES OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S ELITE SECRET TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS AND MAKE THEIR LIVES A LIVING HELL WHICH IS WHY, OF COURSE, I THINK THEIR NAMES SHOULD NEVER COME TO PUBLIC LIGHT.
I WANT TO THANK THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE STAFF WHO PERFORMED THIS WORK. THEY ARE DAN JONES, EVAN GOTTESMAN AND CHAD TURNER, ALISSA STARSZAK.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE TO RELEASE EVERYTHING WITH THE CAMERAS AND THE -- YOU KNOW, WHILE WE'RE RELEASING EVERYTHING THERE THAT'S THE GIST OF IT, ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT, WE DID FAR MORE UNSPEAKABLE THINGS TO MUCH LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT AND LIED ABOUT IT FOR YEARS ON END. WHAT'S THE UP SIDE?
AMERICA IS BIG ENOUGH TO ADMIT WHEN IT'S WRONG AND CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO LEARN FROM ITS MISTAKES. HISTORY WILL JUDGE US BY OUR COMMITMENT TO A JUST SOCIETY GOVERNED BY LAW AND THE WILLINGNESS TO FACE AN UGLY TRUTH AND SAY, NEVER AGAIN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU WANT US TO DO THAT! OKAY, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WE'LL FACE THAT UGLY TRUTH IN JUST A SECOND. I JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT, HOW DID THEY GET THE CHEESE IN THE CRUST? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
