FROM COMEDY  CENTRAL EALZ -- CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT FILMMAKER  EUGENE JARECKI. THE NEW MOVIE ABOUT THE WAR ON  DRUGS. FOR THE MANY WARS AMERICA IS  CURRENTLY FIGHTING, THE ALONG  WITH THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS, WAR ON WOMEN AND THERE'S ONE MORE --  IT WILL COME TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] AFGHANISTAN, I THINK, I DON'T  KNOW. CHRISTMAS IS THE BIG ONE. OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT WAS THE SECOND  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WHICH I  TOTALLY WATCHED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IT'S NOT TAKING PLACE UNTIL  THREE HOURS AFTER WE TAPE THE  SHOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY CUT  OFF OBAMA'S HAND AND THEN TOLD  HIM HE WAS HIS FATHER. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST, ELECTION DAY THREE WEEKS  AWAY. OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY, I  CANNOT BELIEVE THIS THING IS  STILL THREE WEEKS AWAY. WE EXAMINE THE NATION'S  EMOTIONAL STATE IN THE NATION'S  NEW SEGMENT "PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MAKE IT STOP."  CONTROVERSY ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PAUL  RYAN AT A CAMPAIGN STOP IN  GEORGIA -- KIDDING HE WAS IN  OHIO. IS THERE ANOTHER STATE OTHER  THAN (bleep) OHIO? NOT IN OCTOBER THERE ISN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] RYAN SEEN HERE IN PHOTOS HE FOR  SOME REASON SIGNED A RELEASE  FOR -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- OR PERHAPS THESE ARE OUTTAKES  FROM HIS REAL WORLD AUDITION  TAPE. ANYHOO HE WAS CAMPAIGNING WHEN  HE DECIDED TO VOLUNTEER AT A  HOMELESS SHELTER. ONE LITTLE PROBLEM.
ACCORDING TO THE CHARITY'S  PRESIDENT THE CANDIDATE WAS  WASHING PANS THAT WERE ALREADY  CLEANED. AND ONLY AFTER THE PATRONS HAD  LEFT THE PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD  IT IS TO MAKE VOLUNTEERING AT A  HOMELESS SHELTER LOOK LIKE A NEGATIVE THING AND HOW DEAD  INSIDE DOES A NATIONAL  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MAKE YOU THAT YOU COULD BE HANDED CLEAN  DISHES AND INSTEAD OF SAYING,  YOU KNOW THESE ARE CLEAN RIGHT, YOU GO, WHERE IS MY SCRUBBY  SPONGE. THERE'S MORE.
AS WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW THERE  WERE DIRTY DISHES LEFT FOR HIM. IT WAS ORIGINALLY REPORTED THEY  WERE CLEAN. OUR TEAM IS REPORTING DIRTY  DISHES.
Jon: GREAT WORK, TEAM. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE STATUS OF  THESE DISHES LATER ON IN THE  PROGRAM. APPARENTLY RYAN DID WASH DISHES  BUT THEY WERE SET ASIDE AND LEFT  UNCLEAN SPECIFICALLY SO THEY COULD TAKE PICTURES OF HIM  SELFLESSLY WASHING SO SO THAT  WE -- BECAUSE WE'RE SO DO YOU MEAN -- BELIEVE HE WAS CAUGHT IN  THE ACT OF VOLUNTEERING. LATER FOOD WAS HELD FROM NURSING  HOME PATIENTS SO RYAN COULD AL  RIFF AND REANIMATE THEM THROUGH THE MAGIC OF APPLESAUCE. [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN CYNICAL HELP IS HELP FOR  THE SHELTER.
THE HEAD OF THE FAITH-BASED  ORGANIZATION TOLD THE POST NO  POLITICIANS HAVE PERMISSION TO STAGE EVENTS EVENTS. HE ACCUSED THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN  OF QUOTE "RAMRODDING ITS WAY  INTO THE BUILDING."
Jon: YOU BROKE INTO A  HOMELESS SHELTER TO TAKE A  PICTURE OF YOU MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT WASHING ALREADY CLEAN  DISHES? ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO  MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS  THROUGH PREFABRICATED SCENARIOS PUT SOME OOMPH INTO IT. THAT'S THE SOCIAL CONTRACT  BETWEEN YOU AND THE VOTERS. IF YOU DON'T GIVE A (bleep)  ABOUT YOU THE HOMELESS GIVE A  (bleep) THAT YOU GAVE A  (bleep). DON'T PHONE IN CYNICISM. IT'S LIKE JOE BIDEN PUTTING A  HARD HAT AND GOGGLES AND POSING  IN FRONT OF A CHEESECAKE  FACTORY. HE'S LIKE, (bleep) IT IT SAYS  FACTORY ON THE OUTSIDE. I WANT THIS TO BE OVER. WITH ALL THE FOCUS ON THE  CAMPAIGN WE MISS INTERESTING  STORIES.
THE UNITED STATES ANTI-DOPING  AGENCY HAS RELEASED WHAT IT  CALLS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT SEVEN TIME TOUR DE FRANCE WINNER  LANCE ARMSTRONG DOPED THROUGHOUT  HIS PROFESSIONAL CYCLING CAREER. 1,000 PAGES OF EVIDENCE AND  SWORN STATEMENTS BY 26 PEOPLE  INCLUDING 11 OF HIS FORMER  TEAMMATES. THE USADA CALLED IT THE MOST SEW  FIST DATED AND PROACIALIZED  DOPING -- PROFESSIONALIZED DOPING PROGRAM THE SPORT HAS  EVER SEEN.
Jon: TAKE THAT OTHER DOPING  PROGRAMS. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! MY GOD SUDDENLY I'M MUSSOLINI. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, ARMSTRONG FOR YEARS  HAS DENIED THE ALLEGES. HAS HONESTY FALLEN THROUGH THE  CRACKS IN AMERICA? LEWIS BLACK IS HERE WITH MORE  "BACK IN BLACK." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH  LANCE ARMSTRONG? EVERYBODY WHO HAS EVER KNOWN HIM  SAYS HE WAS DOPING. EVERYBODY WHO EVER RODE WITH  HIM, EVERYBODY WHO EVER SLEPT  WITH HIM, EVERYBODY WHO JAMMED A NEEDLE IN HIS TANK. THEY ALL SAY HE WAS DOPING. BUT NOT LANCE.
AFTER A DECADE OF FIGHTING  WITH THE UNITED STATES  ANTI-DOPING AGENCY PROFESSIONAL CYCLIST LANCE ARMSTRONG HAS  GIVEN UP.
HE INSISTS HE IS INNOCENT BUT  SAYS HE'S TIRED OF FIGHTING. THESE THINGS TAKE TIME AND  ENERGY AND SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF  YOU.
THAT SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF  YOU. YOU WIN A 2,000 MILE BIKE RACE  SEVEN YEARS IN A ROW AND GOING  TO COURT ONCE A MONTH IS TOO MUCH WORK? BUT I SUPPOSE THIS DOES EXPLAIN  HIS NEW DENY STRONG BRACELET. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, I DON'T CARE THAT LANCE  ARMSTRONG WAS DOPING I CARE HE  WON'T ADMIT IT.
THE CHARACTERISTICS ARE  NOTHING SHORT AFTER SUNDAY TING.
POSSIBLY THE BEST ENDURANCE  ATHLETE IN THE WORLD.
HIS HEART CAN BEAT TWICE THAT  OF A NORMAL PERSON.
GETS ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT  OF OXYGEN OUT OF EVERY BREATH  THAN A HEALTHY 20-YEAR-OLD  WOULD. HIS MUSCLES CAN GO HARDER AND  LONGER WITHOUT MAJOR FATIGUE.
HE HAD CANCER IN HIS LUNGS,  BRAIN, TESTICLES, HE WENT  INFLUENCE CHEMO AND LOST ONE OF HIS BALLS FOR CHRIST SAKE AND HE  IS GETTING DOUBLE THE OXYGEN OUT  OF EVER BREATH. THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T BE:  WAS  HE DOPING? THE QUESTION SHOULD BE:  WHY  AREN'T ALL OF US DOPE SOMETHING  IN. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I GET WINDED LIGHTING A  CIGARETTE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THINK OF THE KIDS. I MEAN, IF A HERO LIKE LANCE  ARMSTRONG WON'T TAKE  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT THEY MIGHT DO IF  THEY THINK THEY CAN JUST DENY  IT.
I SWEAR TO EACH AND EVERY ONE  OF YOU THAT EVERY ALLEGATION OF  GROSS AND IMMORAL ACTIVITY OF CHUGGING OF ALCOHOL NEVER TOOK  PLACE AT THE PI KAPPA ALPHA  HOUSE.
FIRST THINGS FIRST. HATS OFF TO THE BROTHERS IN THE  BACKGROUND FOR SOMEHOW KEEPING A  STRAIGHT FACE WHILE ORVILLE RED ENBALKER LAWYER SAYS BUTT  CHUGGING.
AN ACTIVITY CALLED BUTT  CHUGGING THAT IS THE FIRST TIME  HE HAS EVER HEARD OF THE TWO WORDS BUTT CHUGGING, BUTT  CHUGGING, WE ASKED SATURDAY  ANDER FEFS BUTT CHUGGING AND HIS COMMENT WAS, WHAT IN THE WORLD  IS THAT? [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT? IT'S WHERE YOU CHUG WITH YOUR  BUTT. DON'T THEY TEACH ENGLISH TELL  UNIVERSITY OF -- ENGLISH AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE? WHAT IS SO BAD AT BUTT CHUGGING  ANYWAYS. YOU TELL ME I CAN DRINK AND  SMOKE AT THE SAME TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT COULD BE WORSE THAN THIS? I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON A LIMB  HERE AND SAY NOTHING COULD BE  WORSE THAN THIS.
CARLOS ARE MEARS WAS ARRESTED  ON MONDAY IN A WARRANT FOR  CRIEWLT AT THIS TO ANIMALS. HE IS ACCUSED OF PERFORMING SEX  ACTS WITH A 22 MONTH OLD DONKEY  NAMED DOODLE. OKAY, I GUESS THAT WAS WORSE. IN HIS DEFENSE, THAT DOODLE IS  ONE SWEET PIECE OF ASS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THIS GUY ACTUALLY GOT CAUGHT  IN THE ACT. BUT YOU KNOW AMERICANS, I'M SURE  HE WILL FIND SOME WAY TO DENY  IT.
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LOT OF  DIFFERENT FARMS AND BUILT A LOT  OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ANIMALS.
BUT I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL  RELATIONS WITH THAT DONKEY  DOODLE.
I MAY LOVE MY ANIMALS IN  DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THAT DOES NOT  MEAN I DO NOT LOVE MY ANIMALS.
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU ARE NOT  GOING TO DENY THIS, ARE YOU?
PONIES AND DONKEYS --
HALLELUJAH, WE FOUND THE ONE  HONEST MAN IN AMERICA. AND HE'S A DONKEY (bleep). JON?
Jon: THANK YOU LEWIS. LEWIS BLACK. BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS,  LEWIS BLACK, SOLD OUT SHOWS ON  BROADWAY KICKING CRAZY ASS. LEWIS CONGRATULATIONS ON T
