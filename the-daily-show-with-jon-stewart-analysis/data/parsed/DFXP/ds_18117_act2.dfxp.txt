( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: WELCOME BACK. THE SUPREME COURT WILL SOON HAND  DOWN A PAIR OF HISTORIC RULINGS  ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE, MARKING A TURNING POINT IN THE FIGHT FOR  GAY RIGHTS. WHAT ABOUT THOSE WHO THE MARCH  OF PROGRESS HAS LEFT BEHIND? SAM BEEHAS MORE.
GAY RIGHTS HAVE MADE GREAT  STRIDES WITH THE MAJORITY OF  AMERICANS SUPPORTING SAME SEX MARRIAGE BUT THERE ARE STILL  MILLIONS SUFFERING FROM THE  STING OF BIGOTRY AND BULLYING. CHRISTIANS.
IT'S OPEN SEASON TO BULLY  CHRISTIANS, AND ALL IN THE NAME  TOLERANCE AND DIVERSITY.
IF I SAY I SUPPORT  TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE, I'M  AUTOMATICALLY CALLED A BIGOT. I'M CALLED A HOMOPHOB.
WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT  WHERE THESE HOMOFASCISTS ARE  GOING TO FORCE US TO WEAR ON OUR SLEEVES SOME KIND OF IDENTIFYING  MARKER.
AND EVANGELICALS HAVE FOUND  THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF THE  MOST HORRIFIC BULLYING.
THE CHRISTIANS ARE GETTING  BULLYING. THE CHRISTIANS I TALK TO ARE  INTIMIDATED. THEY GET INTIMIDATED.
FOR WHAT.
FOR SAYING HOMOSWULT IS  WRONG, OR THEY ARE SINFUL, JUST  LIKE PEDOPHILES, JUST LIKE LIARS, JUST LIKE THIEVES.
SO THE HOMOSEXUALS DON'T LIKE  THAT.
THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE JUST  NOT VERY TOLERANT.
SO, HEY, JERK, BE MORE  TOLERANT OF YOUR INTOLERANCE. AFTER SPENDING AN AFTERNOON--  CHRISTIAN, COMING THROUGH! I REALIZED HOW TOUGH IT IS. PEOPLE WOULDN'T STOP STARING AT  US. HEY! WATCH OUT! I GOT A CHRISTIAN! IT WAS CLEAR THAT INTOLERANCE  TOWARDS CHRISTIANS IS A HUGE  PROBLEM IN HIS MIND, AND THOUGH THERE ARE COUNTLESS ACTUAL  EXAMPLES OF APPALLING  INTOLERANCE AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS, THAT'S MISSING THE REAL STORY.
THE REVERSE HAPPENS AS WELL. WHERE HOMOSEXUAL GOES OUT AND  FIND STRAIGHTS TO BEAT UP.
REALLY?
YEAH.
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
THESE KINDS OF EVENTS ARE NOT  PUBLICIZED VERY WELL. WHY IS THIS NOT BEING COVERED?
YES, WHY IS THIS HYPOTHETICAL  VIOLENCE NOT BEING COVERED OR  RECORDED OR EVEN OCCURRING? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THE FIGURES  ARE BEING HUSHED UP BY THE  HOMOSEXUAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.
HOW COME THE HOMOSEXUALS  AREN'T DEFENDING US CHRISTIANS  WITH OUR RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS OURSELVES.
AT WHAT POINT HAS YOUR RIGHT  TO EXPRESS YOURSELF BEEN  INFRINGED UPON?
( LAUGHTER )
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN, BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT  IT. I HAVE A RADIO SHOW. I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT ANY  OPPRESSION THAT MAY COME.
SURE.
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT SAY, "MATT,  YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ON THE RADIO  THAT HOMOSWULT IS A SIN."
YOU CAN'T EVEN GO ON THE  RADIO ANYMORE AND CONDEMN A  WHOLE SUBSET OF PEOPLE TO HELL WITHOUT GETTING SOME BLOWBACK.
WHEN YOU FUT THAT WAY, IT  DOES SOUND RATHER ARROGANT AND  MYOPIC AND NARROW MINDED AND  BIGOTED.
GOOD, THEN I'VE DONE MY JOBS. NO WONDER HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT  CHRISTIAN OPPRESSION. THERE ARE SO FEW PLACE WHERE'S  THEY CAN SAFELY CONCONGREGATE,  APART FROM TRUCK STARTS, INAUGURATIONING THE ENTIRE  MILITARY, AND THE CHURCHES IN  MAJOR AND MINOR CITIES. IT MAKES YOU FEAR FOR VULNERABLE  YOUNG CHRISTIANS LIKE TODD  CLAYTON.
I'VE BEEN CALLED NAMES AND  SHUNNED FROM A COMMUNITY THAT I  GREW UP IN, HAD TO QUIT MY JOB.
ALL BECAUSE YOU'RE AN  OUTSPOKEN CHRISTIAN.
IT'S BECAUSE I'M GAY.
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE  A CHRISTIAN?
I'M ALSO GAY.
SO IT WAS THE GAY PART OF  YOU?
RIGHT.
THAT WAS BULLIED?
RIGHT, EXACTLY.
OKAY, BUT AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU  MUST ADMIT YOU NEED PROTECTION  FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
THAT'S INSANE.
THIS INTOLERANCE GAY THUG WAS  JUST GETTING WARMED UP.
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS NOT  EXPERIENCING BULLYING. IT'S A GIANT TEMPER TANTRUM THAT  THEY DON'T GET TO BE IN CHARGE  ANYMORE AND THAT THEY HAVE TO SHARE THEIR TOYS.
OKAY, I DON'T THINK THE  EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS WANT TO  PLAY WITH YOUR GAY TOYS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH CLOROX IN THE  WORLD. CLOSED MINDED GAY AGENDISTS LIKE  TODD WEREN'T WILLING TO REACH  OUT TO THE OTHER SIDE THE WAY MATT WAS.
I HAVE HOMOSEXUAL FRIEND.
OKAY, THAT'S SO COOL.
I HAD A FRIEND AT THE GYM  BACK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  WHERE HE SAT DOWN NEXT TO ME IN A JACUZZI, AND I KNEW RIGHT AWAY  HE WAS GAY.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I JUST KNEW. AND WE BECAME FRIENDS FOR A  YEAR. WE WERE SITTING IN THE CAR  TOGETHER AFTER GOING DANCING  TOGETHER AND HAVING FUN AND DOING MOVIES. AND HE TOLD ME. AND I SAID, "YEAH, I KNEW."  AND HE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
FIRST OF ALL, I MET YOU IN A  JACIEWZY AND WE CONSTANTLY GOING  GDANCING TOGETHER.
THAT WASN'T EVEN IT. HE WAS-- HE HAD SOME FRIENDS. ANYWAY.
SOALL THE EVANGELICAL  CHRISTIANS OUT THERE, BE PROUD  OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHO YOU WANT TO CONDEMN TO ETERNAL  DAMNINATION. SOME DAY THE GAY BULLIES MAY  LEARN TO ACCEPT YOU. I FEEL LIKE IF YOU EVER GOT THE  CHANCE TO JUST KNOW A REAL  CHRISTIAN BY HAVING A JACUZZI WITH THEM AND MAYBE GOING  DANCING A FEW TIMES WITH THEM,  MAYBE YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR OPINION CHRISTIANS.
SOUNDS PRETTY GAY.
I GUESS THE NAME CALLING MAY  NEVER END.
John: THANK YOU, SAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEE
