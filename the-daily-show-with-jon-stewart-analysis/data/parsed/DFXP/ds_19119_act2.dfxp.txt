WELCOME BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IF ONE THING IS CLEAR, IF ONE THING IS CLEAR, JUST ONE, AMERICA CAN'T SOLVE THE CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST BY ITSELF. BUT WHO WILL HELP US? RUSSIA? CHINA? [LAUGHTER] THE REST OF THE WORLD'S BUSY WITH THE SOCCER THING I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT EARLIER. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S NO ONE WE CAN TURN TO. I DON'T, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. ♪♪ I'M ALL OUT OF LOVE. I'M SO LOST WITHOUT YOU. ♪♪
Jon: NO, AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI? THE SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IRAN'S LEADERS HAVE SAID THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE UNITED STATES, THE GREAT SATAN IN THEIR VIEW, IN ORDER FIGHT ISIS.
Jon: WHAT? YOU'LL WORK WITH US, SATAN? [LAUGHTER] YOU WOULD DO THIS? I NEVER THOUGHT WE'D GET BACK TOGETHER, BUDDY. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE IT A SHOT, IRAN MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE. [LAUGHTER] HEY, BABY. I KNOW WE HURT EACH OTHER, BUT LET'S NOT FOCUS ON WHO OVERTHREW WHO'S GOVERNMENT IN A C.I.A. COUP OR WHO STORMED WHO'S EMBASSY OR WHO PUT WHO IN WHICH AXIS OF WHAT. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE BOTH CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT EACH OTHER. LET'S BE HONEST, YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM WAS CLEARLY JUST A WAY TO DRIVE BY OUR HOUSE AT 3:00 A.M. AND HIT THE HORN. AND YOU KNOW OUR SANCTIONS ARE JUST US CALLING YOU DRUNK CRYING. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, BABY? LET'S PUT THE PAST BEHIND US AND WORK TOGETHER, JUST, JUST THE TWO OF US. JUST... ♪ DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT ME ♪♪ WHAT THE HELL? WHAT'S THAT? WHERE'S? WHAT? [LAUGHTER] KING ABDULLAH OF SAUDI ARABIA. HEY, WHAT'S UP, YOUR HIGHNESS? WHAT YOU DOING THERE? HEY, STILL THE CENTER OF SUNNI ISLAM? BECAUSE IRAN, WE'RE JUST TALKING. THAT WAS JUST TALK. YOU KNOW,  WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING TOGETHER TO FIGHT THIS NEW SUNNI GROUP, BUT THAT'S VERY CASUAL. THAT'S, THAT'S COOL WITH YOU, RIGHT?
ALL THE SUPPORT THAT ISIS IS GETTING, THAT THESE GROUPS THAT ARE NOW MARCHING ARE GETTING ARE FROM SAUDI ARABIA.
Jon: KING, YOUR SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDING THESE EXTREMIST GROUPS? HOW LONG'S THAT BEEN GOING ON?
WE'VE KNOWN FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAVE BEEN FUNNELING A LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.
Jon: SON OF A --  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. WELL, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING. HMPH. [LAUGHTER] HEY, BABY. NOW I SEE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SAYING ABOUT THOSE GUYS. BOOP-BOOP. PRETENDING TO CARE ABOUT US IN THE U.S., MEANWHILE THEY'RE GOING AROUND FUNDING ANTI-AMERICAN RADICALS BEHIND OUR BACK. THAT'S NOT RESPECT. SURE, YOU SAY DEATH TO AMERICA AND YOU BURN OUR FLAG, BUT YOU DO IT TO OUR FACE, SO I THINK THAT WE CAN PUT THIS BEHIND -- ♪ MY MILK SHAKE BRINGS ALL THE BOYS TO THE YARD ♪♪ ♪AND THEY'RE LIKE, IT'S BETTER THAN YOURS ♪ SAUDI ARABIA, WE'RE DONE HERE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I SAW IN YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. [AUDIENCE REACTS] OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I SAW, SWEET, DELICIOUS OIL, SO LIGHT, SO CRUDE.  ♪ AND I RAN, I RAN SO FAR AWAY ♪♪
Jon: HEY, WHAT'S UP AYATOLLAH? LISTEN, I KNOW WE WERE TALKING BEFORE, BUT SAUDI ARABIA, YOU KNOW, THEY GOT OUR BACK WITH THE OIL THING, SO I DON'T KNOW, YOU MIGHT CALL US A BLACK GOLD DIGGER IF YOU WILL, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, WE GOT THE LOOK OUT FOR OUR... OH. ARE THOSE THOSE MISSILES WE SECRETLY SOLD YOU IN THE '80s TO HELP YOU FIGHT SADDAM? THAT'S WHEN WE BOTH FIRST REALIZED OUR SHARED LOVE OF BOMBING IRAQ. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S THE KIND OF PARTNER WE NEED IN THE MIDDLE EAST, SOMEONE WHO WORKS WITH US TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL, NOT SOMEONE WHO BUYS US WITH SLUDGE WHILE FUNDING OUR ENEMIES. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE... ♪ I GOT THE POWER ♪ LOOK, IT'S OVER. WE'RE DONE. OUR AFFECTION CANNOT BE BOUGHT, SAUDI ARABIA. IT'S... REALLY? MORE? MORE OIL? YOU THINK WE'RE THAT DESPERATE? I MEAN, IT DOES LOOK TASTY, BUT LOOK, WE HAVE TO BE WITH IRAN. IT'S COMPLICATED WITH THEM, TOO, BUT THEY'RE SAYING SOME VERY SWEET THINGS THESE DAYS, AND I... [MUSIC PLAYING] OH, [BLEEPED]. NO, NO, NO, HEY, HEY, WHAT'S UP? OH, SORRY, BIBI NETANYAHU, I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN FOR "HAZZENASENHA" THE JEWISH FESTIVAL OF GUILT AND PASSIVE AGGRESSION. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THIS IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, BUBBIE. IT'S JUST US PLOTTING SECRET ALLIANCES WITH YOUR TWO MORTAL ENEMIES. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW, I BETTER GET THE [BLEEPED] OUT OF HERE.
