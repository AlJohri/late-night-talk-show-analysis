FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY NICE OF YOU. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST, CECILE RICHARDS, THE STAR OF NBC'S "PARENTHOOD."  [LAUGHTER] OH. SHE'S THE PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT CRAIGT. NELSON IS REALLY LIKE ARE... ANYWAY, WE BEGIN TONIGHT  WITH ACCIDENT YES'S PARADOX, WHICH BOSTON CHEWLATES THAT TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION, YOU MUST FIRST TRAVEL HALF THE  DISTANCE TOWARDS IT AND FROM THERE HALF THE REMAINING DISTANCE SO ON AND SO ON IPSO  FACTO ET AL, ERR GO, VIS-A-VIS, SAY LAW VIE. ONE CAN NEVER ARRIVE AT THE END POINT, WHICH BRINGS US TO THE RACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN  NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT. OUR COVERAGE OF ENDLESS SUFFRAGE 2012. ALL I HEARD, ALL I HEARD FROM THESE FOOLS WAS THAT TUESDAY WAS SUPER TUESDAY. SO NAMED NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS SENT TO EARTH BY ITS PARENT IN A CRYSTAL SPACE SHIP MOMENTS  BEFORE KRYPTON EXPLODED, ALTHOUGH IT WAS, BUT BECAUSE WE WOULD FINALLY HAVE A DECISIVE NIGHT, ONE THAT WOULD FINALLY  FINISH THIS NEVER-ENDING GOB STOPPER. TELL US FINALLY ONCE AND FOR ALL WHERE CARMEN SAN DIEGO IS. SERIOUSLY, IT IS LIKE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT IS BEING SELECTED AT THIS POINT  BY EROSION. AND THE KEY TO LAST NIGHT, SUPER TUESDAY, LET THEM TELL YOU.
IF SANTORUM CAN WIN IN OHIO, HE WILL SURVIVE.
IF MITT ROMNEY WINS OHIO, HE TAKES A GIANT STEP FORWARD.
IF SANTORUM CAN SQUEAK THIS GUY...
IF ROMNEY WINS IN OHIO...
SANTORUM CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE OHIO.
IF ROMNEY WINS OHIO.
IF SANTORUM WINS THERE, THE WHOLE OMLETTE IS UP IN THE AIR. IT MAY LAND ON THE FLOOR. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF METAPHORS. THE OMLETTE? WHAT, ARE YOU STAYING AT A HOTEL WHERE AN OMLETTE BAR? THE OMLETTE BAR. OHIO, HUH? SO THAT'S IT. SO OHIO IS THE DECISIVE STATE. WHOEVER WINS THAT ONE, THAT'S IT. AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN...
ROMNEY DELAIRD THE WINNER IN OHIO.
OH, OKAY. THANKS FOR COMING. THAT'S A WRAP. WE'RE JUST GOING TO SIT BACK. SHOW'S OVER PLSM ROMNEY, GOOD LUCK IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. I'M GOING TO SMOKE MY PIPE AND WATCH BOOK NOTES AS I DO UNWINDING AFTER A HARD DAY AT  THE SATIRE FACTORY, UNLESS...
ROMNEY EKED OUT THE WIN IN OHIO.
HE BARELY WON IN THE ALL-IMPORTANT STATE OF OHIO.
MITT ROMNEY WON THE MAP BUT HE LOST THE MOMENTUM.
HE COULD NOT DELIVER A KNOCK-OUT PUNCH.
THE REPUBLICAN RACE FAR FROM OVER, FOLKS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: EVERY TIME. IF ONLY I HAD SEEN REHEARSAL, I WOULD HAVE KNOWN NOT TO GET TOO COMFORTABLE. SUPER TUESDAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DECISIVE, THE SHOT HEARD AROUND THE WORLD. NOW IT'S THE SHOT THAT WAS MATHEMATICALLY INCONCLUSIVE, AND  THAT'S NOT NEARLY AS SATISFYING.
THE THROW. THE LONG DRIVE. IT'S GOING TO BE, I BELIEVE, GOOD ENOUGH. THE GIANTS ARE A LEADING CONTENDER FOR THE PENNANT. THE GIANTS ARE A LEADING CON TENTER FOR THE PENNANT. A LOT OF BASEBALL STILL TO GO.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHO IS THE GREATEST PURVEYOR OF THE FALSE HOPES THAT THIS WOULD END, THE  LUCY WITH THE SUPER TUESDAY FOOTBALL.
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME RESULTS FROM ARGUABLY THE MOST  IMPORTANT SUPER TUESDAY CONTEST, OHIO, THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE.
63 DELEGATES ARE AT STAKE IN OHIO. NO REPUBLICAN HAS EVER WON THE WHITE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER WITHOUT FIRST WINNING OHIO. WHOEVER WINS OHIO WILL WALK AWAY WITH SOMETHING VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO, WHETHER OR NOT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE A PROJECTION OR NOT, BUT GUESS WHAT, OHIO, OHIO, OHIO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING OHIO. WITH A 12-FOOT DIGITAL CLOCK BEHIND YOU AND REPEATING THE WORD OHIO. NOW WATCH CLOSELY AS THIS ENORMOUS BALLOON THAT HAS BEEN INFLATED BEFORE OUR VERY EYES  TURNS OUT TO BE A WHOOPI CUSHION.
OHIO, OHIO, OHIO, THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE.
AND AS EXPECTED, WE CANNOT MAKE A PROJECTION IN OHIO RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ARE YOU NOT... ARE YOU NOT UNDER-TAINED? THERE GOES MY WHOLE NIGHT. SORRY, KIDS, DADDY CAN'T READ YOU A BED TIME STORY. HE HAS TO WATCH JOHN KICK  [BLEEPED] OHIO ON A SCREEN TO FIND HOW DIFFERENTLY CATHOLICS VOTED IN ADAMS COUNTY THIS TIME  VERSUS '08. AND GET YOUR THING OFF CUYAHOGA. YOU'RE WELCOME. BLITZER'S ENTHUSIASM IS SO PURE, IT MUST BE REAL. IT'S LIKE THEY KEEP EVEN HIM IN THE DARK ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON SO HIS ON-SCREEN  EMOTIONS SEEM LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAPPENING. IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE DOG IN "BOLT." BUT BELIEVE ME, AT A CERTAIN  POINT, OTHER PERSONALITIES ON CNN...
AT WHAT POINT WILL WE BE ABLE TO PROJECT A WINNER IN OHIO?
THAT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION WE ASK AROUND THIS TIME BECAUSE WE  ALL WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
Jon: HE'S MAKING A BREAK FOR IT. SEAL THE SITUATION ROOM. COOPER'S ON THE MOVE. OF COURSE, ALL THIS DIDN'T PREVENT CNN FROM BREAKING OUT THE NEWEST WEAPON IN NON-INFORMATION.
TOM FOREMAN IS TAKING US ON A VIRTUAL, A VIRTUAL CONVENTION TO GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW THE  DELEGATE COUNT MAY PLAY OUT.
I'M VIRTUALLY STANDING RIGHT NOW AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN TAMPA.
Jon: YOU'RE GOL HALLOW DECK TECHNOLOGY, AND YOU'RE BLOWING  IT ON THE INSIDE OF THE TAMP THAT CONVENTION CENTER. HOW THE HELL CAN YOU NOT PLACE YOURSELF ON A SPACE SHIP OR 18th CENTURY FRANCE OR  COMBINE THE TWO WITH A ZERO GRAVITY BROTHEL. I'M SORRY. I INTERRUPTED YOU. SHOW ME AGAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PRETEND TAMPA.
NOW LET'S SEE HOW THE BATTLEFIELD IS CHANGING THIS EVENING.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGER NIGHTS FOR NEWT GINGRICH. WE'VE ADDED HIS NEW DELEGATES OVER THERE ON THE LEFT. BUT LOOK AT MITT ROMNEY. EXPANDING HIS LEAD, TRYING TO GRIND DOWN HIS OPPONENTS BY PICKING UP ANOTHER WHOLE BLOC OF SEATS.
Jon: WELL, MITT ROMNEY IS VERY POPULAR WITH THOSE ARTIFICIALLY RENDERED COMPUTER PEOPLE. I THINK WE MAY HAVE FOUND HIS BASE. [LAUGHTER] ACTUALLY, WE KID AROUND. ANY VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT DOES HAVE ITS UNPREDICTABLE DANGERS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER THERE.
AT THAT POINT ALL BETS ARE OFF.
KEEP IT CLEAN.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
GODDAMNIT, LEROY.
GODDAMNIT. LEROY, YOU MORON. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GUARANTEE YOU, I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S A DUDE RIGHT NOW WATCHING TV THAT JUST  HAD THE CHANGE HIS PANTS. GUARANTEE YOU. OH, MY GOD, OH... [LAUGHTER] I [BLEEPED] THAT. LEROY! ALL RIGHT. ANYWAY, THE CANDIDATES DIDN'T EVEN STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH ALL THE COVERAGE. ALL OF THEM GIVING THEIR SPEECHES WELL BEFORE ALL THE VOTES WERE COUNTED. RICK SANTORUM OPENED HIS SPEECH ON A NOTE OF CHARMING HUMILITY.
WE'RE IN STEUBENVILLE, OHIO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NOT TOO MANY PRESIDENTIAL CAN DATES COME TO STEUBENVILLE OHIO, MUCH LESS HOLD THEIR VICTORY PARTY IN STEUBENVILLE, OHIO.
Jon: THEY CAN HEAR YOU. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, WHAT KIND OF A SCHMUCK WOULD HOLD A VICTORY PARTY IN THIS [BLEEPED] HOLE. AM I RIGHT? SERIOUSLY. THE NIGHT'S BIGGER WINNER THAN THE OTHER WINNERS, WHAT NOTE WOULD HE SOUND, GRANDIOSE, HUMBLE, GRATEFUL?
ON NOVEMBER 6th WE'RE GOING TO STAND UNITED, NOT ONLY HAVING WON AN ELECTION, BUT  HAVING SAVED A FUTURE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SAVED A FUTURE. WHAT ARE YOU, A 2-1,000 SENT BACK TO WARN US OF THE COMING ROBOT APOCALYPSE. OH, MY GOD, MITT ROMNEY IS THE-1000 SENT BACK TO WARN US OF
