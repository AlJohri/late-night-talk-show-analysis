THE RACHEL MADO SONG.
Jon: IT'S THE RACHEL MADDOW  SONG. ♪ RACHEL MADDOW IS HERE. ♪♪
EXCELLENT.
Jon: WE'LL GET TO THE  SEQUESTER.
CAN'T WAIT.
Jon: YOU WERE AT THE  SUPREME COURT.
YES.
Jon: YESTERDAY?
YESTERDAY.
Jon: THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. YOU GOT IN. DETAILS.
SO WE DON'T -- I DON'T -- I  FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER  LINE THAT IS LONG ENOUGH THAT GOES HIGH ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND  HOW ON THE SAME DAY WE'RE  UNVEILING THE STATUE OF ROSA PARKS AT THE U.S. CAPITOL AND  ONE BLOCK AWAY WE'RE CONSIDERING  GETTING RID OF THE PILLAR OF AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS LAW AND  THAT HAPPENS AT THE SAME TIME AT  THE SAME PLACE AND NOBODY'S HEAD  EXPLODES. I THINK THE VOTING RIGHTS ACTED  IS REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT SO OLD THAT IT SEEMS  LIKE IT DOESN'T APLY. WHEN I WANTED TO TALK TO  SOMEBODY ABOUT IT I TALKED TO  JOHN LEWIS WHO WAS NEARLY KILLED ON A BRIDGE IN SELMA LESS THAN A  WEEK BEFORE PRESIDENT JOHNSON  FORMED A SESSION OF CONGRESS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY DID TO THE  MAN IN SELMA. JOHN LEWIS IS STILL IN CONGRESS. THERE'S NO CAMERA. WE NEVER GET FOOTAGE OF WHAT  HAPPENS IN THERE. IT'S WEIRD TO SEE ANTONIN SCALIA  IN PERSON. WEIRD.
Jon: DOES HE. I ONLY READ SOME OF THE  TRANSCRIPTS OF WHAT HE WAS  SAYING. HE WAS SAYING WE'VE GOT TO GET  RID OF THIS BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF  LAST INVEST YIJS OF RACIAL  PREFERENCE.
HE SAID WHEN CONGRESS REUPPED  THEY LOOKED INTO WHETHER OR NOT  IT WAS STILL NECESSARY. TEN MONTHS OF DEBATE, 21  HEARINGS, 15,000 PAGES OF  EVIDENCE AND IN THE SENATE THEY VOTED 98-0, YEAH WE STILL NEED  BUT HE SAID, YEAH WHAT DOES THAT  VOTE MEAN.
Jon: DIDN'T HE SAY WE TOLD  THEM TO FIX THIS IN 2006 BUT  CLEARLY THEY CAN'T OR WON'T SO WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR THEM.
VOTING IS A RACIAL  ENTITLEMENT NOW. SOMETHING YOU ARE ENTITLED TO ON  THE BASIS OF YOUR RACE. WAIT A SECOND. DO YOU KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS. I THINK HE DOES KNOW. THAT'S THE NEAT THING ABOUT  BEING THERE IN PERSON YOU CAN  SEE OH, ACTUALLY HE'S A TROLL. ESSAYING THIS FOR EFFECT -- HE HE  IS SAYING THIS FOR EFFECT. HE KNOWS HE'S GOING TO GET A  GASP. HE LOVES IT. HE'S LIKE THE GUY IN THE BLOG  COMMENTS USING THE N WORD. AHH! DID THAT MAKE YOU MAD. HOW ABOUT IF I SAY THIS?
Jon: WAS HE LIKE BY THE WAY  I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU BA-BAM! THAT'S GUY?
HE'S THAT KIND OF GUY. WHAT WE'RE SHOCKED THAT HE SAID  SOMETHING SO BLATANTLY RACIALLY  OFFENSIVE HE'S THINKING OH, YEAH, I DID.
Jon: BA-BOOM.
THAT'S NEAT TO SEESM IT'S  ALSO NEAT TO SEE SONIA SOTOMAYOR  LEANING AROUND THE BENCH AND GIVE HIM WHAT FOR. ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE  TECHNICALLY TO THE LAWYERS AND  SHE'S TALKING TO ANTONIN SCALIA AND IT'S LIKE A BRAWL BETWEEN  THEM.
Jon: ARE THE PEOPLE THAT  HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, DO  THEY KNOW HIM AND SAY -- BUT THE NEW KID IS SHAKEN OR ANGERED BY  THAT. READY FOR IT AND HAS A  REJOINEDDER THAT MAKE HIM FEEL  EMBARRASSED IF HE WASN'T A TROLL THAT LOVES TO MAKE PEOPLE MAD.
Jon: WHAT IS SURPRISING IS  THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO REVISIT  THIS SORT OF THING. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THERE  ARE STILL LAWS IN VIRGINIA THAT  SAID THINGS LIKE IF YOU ARE NOT MARRIED YOU CANNOT COHABITAT,  THINGS THAT DON'T HAVE SUNSET  CLAUSES BUT YOU HAVE THIS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT WE  SHOULD LOOK AT THAT EVERY 18  MONTHS. WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE  AFTER A WHILE THEY'LL GET OVER  IT, SNRIET. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF  THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF SOME OF  THESE FOUNDATIONS OF CIVIL  RIGHTS. IS THERE A RATIONALE BEHIND  THAT?
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IT'S NOT  A NEW PROBLEM IN THE WORLD WHEN  IT WAS BROUGHT UP IT WAS SOMETHING WE NEEDED TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT. PEOPLE THAT HAD NEVER DONE IT  THEY WERE LIKE WHY ARE YOU  BRINGING THIS UP BEFORE? WE'LL DEAL WITH IT AND IT WILL  GO AWAY. AS DEMOCRACY EXPANDS AND MORE  PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK  IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTEXT GET THEIR POINT ACROSS, WE CAN  ADDRESS NEW PROBLEMS WE DIDN'T  USED TO ADDRESS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE NEW,  IT JUST MEANS THAT WE'RE FINALLY  ADDRESSING THEM. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN 1965  WITH VOTING RIGHTS AND IN THE  1990'S WITH THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. AS NEW PEOPLE MAKE THE  DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WORK FOR THEM  THEIR PROBLEMS GET ADDRESSED  TOO.
Jon: WHAT ESSAYING IS THIS  WORKED. LET'S GET RID OF IT NOW. IT WORKED SO WELL, THE PROBLEM  IS GONE. RIGHT, BUT WHAT SOLVED IT? BIZARRE. WE'RE GOING -- WE RAN OUT. WITH YOU STICK AROUND AND TALK  SEQUESTER. WE'LL THROW IT UP ON THE WEB.
EXCLAMATION POINT.
