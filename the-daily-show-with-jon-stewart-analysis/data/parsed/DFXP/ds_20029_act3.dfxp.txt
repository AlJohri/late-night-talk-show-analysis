Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST FOR FOX NEWS CHANNEL. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "SUICIDE PACT, THE RADICAL EXPANSION OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS AND THE ASSUALT ON CIVIL LIBERTIES." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO OUR PROGRAM JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO. COME ON HERE, JUDGE! COME ON. (APPLAUSE) JUDGE, YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS FOR YOUR WHOLE CAREER, THIS IDEA OF IT'S CALLED SUICIDE PACT, THAT WE ARE LOSING OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES.
WHERE IS MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL.
Jon: YOU NEED -- WOULD YOU LIKE, WE COULD BRING YOU A TEA CUP PIG IF YOU LIKE. AND AS YOU SAW AS YOU WALKED THROUGH THERE, WE HAVE MANY DOGS THAT YOU COULD PET.
I WANT THAT THREE LEGGED DOG THAT IS MY FAVORITE ONE. YES, YES, YES.
Jon: DIPS. DIPS. THAT'S MY DOG.  HE'S VERY NICE. HE'S A LOVELY -- (AUDIENCE REACTS)
HE'S A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU WOULDN'T AH, HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED. HE HAD FOUR, BUT HE DIDN'T LISTEN. WE GOT HIM AT THREE. LET ME ASK YOU THIS CIVIL LIBERTIES.
YES.
SOMETHING YOU AND I AGREE ON.
Jon: WE AGREE ON. IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL-- IS IT LIKE A BEACH BODY? CAN YOU GET IT BACK AFTER IT'S GONE? IS IT THE KIND OF THING THAT ONCE IT ERODES WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO RECLAIM IT IT AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF RECLAIMING IT?
WE RARELY RECLAIM IT ONCE THE GOVERNMENT TAKES IT FROM US. WE ARE STILL PAYING OFF DEBT ON WORLD WAR I. WE ARE STILL SUFFERING UNDER LAWS THAT MAKE IT A CRIME TO DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN WORLD WAR I.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE GOVERNMENT LIKES POWER. IT'S EASIER FOR IT TO ACCOMPLISH ITS PURPOSES.
Jon: RIGHT. WHEN IF DOESN'T HAVE A NASTY THING LIKE FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN THE WAY. SO I WRITE THESE BOOKS. I'M I'M AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY CRITICIZER, AS YOU KNOW. THIS GOES AFTER GEORGE W. BUSH AND BARACK OBAMA. I WRITE THESE BOOKS SO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNOWS THAT WITH EVERY TICK OF THE CLOCK, LIBERTY IS BEING LOST.
Jon: BUT IT'S NOT JUST EXECUTIVE POWER. FOR INSTANCE, YOU KNOW, WITH BARACK OBAMA, WITH HIS-- THE BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, CONGRESS COULD HAVE STEPPED IN. WITH THE IMMIGRATION EDICT, CONGRESS COULD STEP IN. WHY DON'T THEY?
CONGRESS IS -- CONGRESS IS AS MUCH A CULPRIT AS PRESIDENT BUSH AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAVE BEEN. CONGRESS COULD STOP A LOT OF THIS WITH THE MAJORITY VOTE. THEY LACK THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO IT. MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES. THE DEMOCRATS GIVE TOO MUCH POWER TO --
Jon: THE JUDICIARY COULD STEP IN. THEY CAN.
ABSOLUTELY. LISTEN, BARACK OBAMA KILLED AMERICANS WITH DRONES. THE GRANDFATHER OF ONE OF THOSE AMERICANS TRIED TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT HAPPENED. THE COURT SAID THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T DO THAT. YOU WANT TO ISSUE AN ORDER TO THE PRESIDENT TELLING HIM NOT TO KILL PEOPLE? WE DON'T BELIEVE HE WOULD DO IT AS SOON AS THEY THREW THE CASE OUT, OVER WENT THE DRONES, DEAD WENT THE AMERICANS. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS KIND OF STUFF IS HAPPENING.
Jon: BUT THERE WAS NO -- AND YOU'RE SAYING THERE WAS NO DUE PROCESS WITHIN THAT. THE AMERICAN WAS SOMEONE APPARENTLY WORKING WITH AL QAEDA, AL-AWLAKI, IS THAT THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
THAT WOULD BE THE SAME AMERICAN THAT THE PENTAGON INVITED TO GIVE LECTURES TO.
Jon: OH, IS THAT TRUE?
YEAH, SAME GUY. AND A 16-YEAR-OLD KID. DUE PROCESS REQUIRES --
Jon: RIGHT.
IF THE GOVERNMENT WANTS LIFE, LIBERTY OR PROPERTY, THEY HAVE TO TRY YOU FIRST.
Jon: SO WHO DOES, GIVE ME, GIVE ME AN AVATAR THAT IS EXEMPLARY, A COUNTRY THAT DOES PROTECT-- IS THERE A COUNTRY, IS THERE A SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS THIS? OR ARE YOU SPITTING IN THE WIND TO SOME EXTENT FOR A WORLD THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYWHERE?
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A COUNTRY ON THE PLANET THAT PROTECTS FREEDOM THE WAY AMERICA-- WE HAVE MORE FREEDOM HERE.
Jon: SO WE'RE THE BEST. WE'RE BAD, BUT WE'RE THE BEST.
YES. YES, BUT WE COULD BE, WE COULD BE A LOT BETTER, MR. STEWART. YOU KNOW THAT.
Jon: BUT NOW, BUT NOW I'M IN TROUBLE.
WHY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?
Jon: BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN US AN ASPIRATION, WE'RE ONLY COMPETING AGAINST OURSELVES.
YES, WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST OURSELVES BECAUSE EVERY PRESIDENT THAT DOES THINGS THAT ARE UNLAWFUL USES THE EXAMPLE OF HIS PREDECESSORS WHO GOT AWAY WITH IT.
Jon: BUT IF WE ARE THE BEST IN THIS SYSTEM --
YES.
Jon: SO THAT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING, IF I MAY, LET'S GET RID OF CAPITALISM, EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE BEST ECONOMIC SYSTEM.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A MINUTE, THAT WE SHOULD GET RID OF CAPITALISM? YOU'RE THE RICHEST GUY IN TELEVISION!
Jon: I'M TELLING YOU, THAT IS, WHAT I AM SAYING IS YOU HAVE THE BET -- IF WE ARE DOING THE BEST --
BUT WE COULD BE DOING BETTER. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT OUR RIGHTS COME FROM OUR HUMANITY, AND NOT FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon: BUT THEN  THAT-- UNDERSTANDING THAT, BUT LET'S ALSO BE REALISTIC ABOUT PEOPLE. NOW LET'S USE THE MIDDLE EAST AS AN EXAMPLE. EGYPT AS AN EXAMPLE.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
Jon: THEY HAVE THIS AMAZING REVOLUTION. MILLIONS TAKE TO THE STREETS, CALL FOR THE OVERTHROW OF AN AUTOCRATIC REGIME. THEY BRING IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THEY ELECT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, A GROUP THAT WE DON'T LIKE.
CORRECT.
Jon: THEY INSTITUTE CERTAIN THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE. THEY RISE UP AGAIN. GENERAL SISI TAKES IT OVER, REALLY CRACKS DOWN ON CIVIL LIBERTIES, THE PEOPLE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
Jon: HE'S VERY POPULAR RIGHT NOW.
I THINK HE'S-- HE'S POPULAR BECAUSE HE'S GIVING AWAY THE STORE BUT HE'S TAKEN MORE LIBERTIES THAN MUBARAK DID. AND THE REASON HE LET MUBARAK OUT OF JAIL IS SO THAT WHEN HE GETS OVERTHROWN, HE WON'T HAVE TO GO TO JAIL.
Jon: YOU THINK HE THINKS THE NEXT DICTATOR.
YES, I DO.
Jon: BUT MY POINT BEING THIS. IS THE PROBLEM REALLY THE GOVERNMENT? OR DOES IT LIE IN US AND OUR DESIRE FOR SAFETY AND FOR LAW AND ORDER AND FOR AUTHORITY?
ON THAT WE AGREE. BECAUSE WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID, THEY WILL SURRENDER THEIR LIBERTIES FOR SAFETY. SO IT IS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S INTEREST --
Jon: BUT EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT AFRAID --
TO KEEP THE PEOPLE AFRAID.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THAT WE WILL PAY MORE TAXES. LET THEM REGULATE MORE OF OUR BEHAVIOR. AND THEY CAN PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND US AND SUPPOSEDLY KEEP US SAFE.
Jon: BUT SHOULDN'T THERE BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHEN WE SHOULD BE AFRAID. ARE THERE TIMES WE SHOULD BE AFRAID? IS THERE NOTHING TO FEAR? SHOULDN'T WE FEAR PEOPLE POURING TOXINS INTO WATER?
OH, OF COURSE WE SHOULD FEAR THOSE THINGS. OF COURSE THERE SHOULD BE LAWS AGAINST IT.
Jon: SO IT IS A BALANCE.
BUT WE SHOULD -- NO, IT'S NOT A BALANCE. IT'S A BIAS IN FAVOR OF FREEDOM, A BIAS IN FAVOR OF FREEDOM. FREEDOM AND SAFETY ARE NOT EQUALS.
Jon: YES.
FREEDOM IS THE DEFAULT.
Jon: I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
BECAUSE WE ARE BORN WITH FREEDOM. ANYBODY FROM NEW JERSEY KNOWS THAT.
Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY -- I THOUGHT WE WERE BORN TO RUN. STICK AROUND, THOUGH, BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS, STICK AROUND, "SUICIDE PACT" IS ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE. JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
