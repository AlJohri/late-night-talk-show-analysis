Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY MET IN NEW YORK LAST WEEK, AND AS WITH EVERY YEAR, IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE MARCH OF THE WOODEN POLITICANS PONTIFICATING TO APATHETIC, HALF-FILLED ROOMS. -- IT WAS REALLY WAIT, WHAT? WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?
INDIAN PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI WAS GIVEN A SUPERSTAR RECEPTION AS HE ADDRESSED A SELLOUT CROWD AT NEW YORK'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.
20,000 MEMBERS OF THE INDIAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TURNED OUT.
Jon: 20,000 PEOPLE? NO WORLD LEADER HAS DRAWN THAT MANY AMERICANS FOR ANYTHING! EXCEPT MAYBE ONE OF YOUR BERLUSCONI BUNGA BUNGA PARTIES. BUT TO BE FAIR, THOSE PARTIES OFFERED BUNGA BUNGA. SO A TRIUMPHANT MOMENT FOR THE NEWLY ELECTED INDIAN PRIME MINISTER MODI. ARE YOU ENJOYING THAT?  YOU LIKE THAT? (LAUGHTER) IT IS GOOD! LISTEN, MODI, YOU'RE PLAYING M.S.G., BABY. THIS IS JAY AND BEY'S HOUSE. YOU GOT TO BRING IT. SO I HOPE "TEAM MODI" KNOWS HOW TO PUT ON A SHOW.
YOUR EMCEE FOR TODAY, MISS AMERICA 2014! (MUSIC, "USA" CHANT) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (MUSIC, "USA" CHANT) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO, WAIT -- HOW DID HE DO THAT? BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIAN AMERICANS WHO WERE  MAD FOR MODI. EVERYONE WANTED A PIECE OF THE NEW STAR, HILLARY CLINTON, BILL DE BLASIO, CHRIS CHRISTIE, CEOS FROM G.E., I.B.M., GOLDMAN SACHS, EVEN THE BIG DOG HIMSELF WHO I CAN ONLY ASSUME TURNED TO MODI AND SAID, MUST BE NICE TO STILL HAVE THAT NEW LEADER SMELL! WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MODI, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GIVE YOUR PEOPLE HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE IT JUST (BLEEP) YOU IN THE END! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T TAKE TO MODI NEARLY AS MUCH AS THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE TOTALLY WON OVER BY MODI'S PRO-BUSINESS MESSAGE.
PRIME MINISTER MODI HAS FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.
IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL SPEECH. I THOUGHT IT ELECTRIFIED THE AUDIENCE HERE.
THIS NEW PRIME MINISTER MR. MODI IS WHAT I THINK WILL BECOME THE NEXT RONALD REAGAN FOR THE WORLD.
Jon: THE NEXT RONALD REAGAN -- BLESSED BE THY NAME -- (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A SACRED HONOR USUALLY ONLY RESERVED FOR AIRPORTS AND POST OFFICES. CAN MODI LIVE UP TO THE NAME?
SOME SUGGEST THAT THE ADORING CROWDS IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF INDIA'S WEALTHY AND NOT INDIA'S POOR MAJORITY, WHO THEY SAY WERE BEING HARMED BY MODI'S POLICIES OF DEREGULATION AND PRIVATIZATION.
THEY ALSO SAY THAT HIS ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS AND POLICIES ARE ONLY HELPING THE 1%, THE RICH.
Jon: HE IS THE NEW RAEGAN. (APPLAUSE) BUT, OF COURSE, REAGAN WAS  KNOWN AS THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR, RAEGAN WAS A GREAT COMMUNICATOR, SOMETHING MODI WILL HAVE TO LIVE UP TO. AND ON SATURDAY, MODI SPOKE AT CENTRAL PARK. WHERE HE HAD A CHANCE TO PROVE HIS REAGANISMS AS A MAN WHO CAN SPEAK TO ALL CULTURES AND ALL PEOPLES. MISTER PRIME MINISTER, SHARE YOUR WORDS IN WAYS WE AMERICANS CAN UNDERSTAND.
GOD BLESS YOU! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WAIT A MINUTE! DO OTHER COUNTRIES THINK THAT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN "STAR WARS"? I NOW HONOR THE WORDS OF YOUR PROPHET, DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
