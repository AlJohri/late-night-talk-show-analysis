MARCH 12, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD NUN FOR YOU TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST GROVER NOR QUIST. MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE SO EXCITED THAT I GOT TO INTERVIEW GROVER. I'M ASSUMING I'M THINKING OF THE RIGHT PERSON. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE INTERNET. THAT MAGICAL SERIES OF TUBES THAT AL GORE INVENTED SO HE'D NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE  TO GET PORN. IT'S TRUE. ANYWAY, TWEETS AND HASH TAGS ABOUT THIS NEW VIRAL SENSATION KONY TRENDING ALL WEEK. RIHANNA TALKING ABOUT HIM. SEACREST, THE BEEBS, THIS GUY KONY IS PROBABLY DROPPING SOME THICK BEEF, JOE. LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
FOR 26 YEARS KONY HAS BEEN KIDNAPPING CHILDREN INTO HIS REBEL GROUPS, THE L.R.A. TURNING THE GIRLS INTO SEX SLAVES AND THE BOYS INTO CHILD SOLDIERS. (LAUGHING)
Jon: WOW. WOW. THAT SONG SUCKED. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET SICK ROLLED. ANYWAY, IT TURNS OUT THE HOT NEW VIRAL SENSATION IS A 30- MINUTE YOU-TUBE DIRECTED BY  JASON RUSSELL CONDEMNING THE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF JOSEPH KONY, A WAR LORD WHOSE UGANDAN  REBEL GROUP IS INFAMOUS FOR ITS USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS, SHOWING SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN INCREDIBLE SOURCE WHETHER YOU ARE UNCOVERING AN AWFUL STORY  OR FINDING OUT WHAT YOUR HIGH SCHOOL FLAME IS UP TO. HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE SAME SEARCH. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT BOY JOEY YOU WENT TO PROM WITH. LET'S CHECK IN ON... OH, MY GOD! SO A 30-MINUTE VIDEO ON CHILD WARRIORS IN UGANDA HAS GONE VIRAL. HOW POPULAR CAN THIS THING BE? I'M SURE IT'S NOT TEENAGE GIRL SINGS SONG ABOUT DAY OF THE WEEK HOT.
IT'S GONE VIRAL. TENS OF MILLIONS OF VIEWS ON YOU-TUBE IN JUST A FEW DAYS.
10 MILLION HITS A DAY.
UP TO 26 MILLION VIEWS.
39 MILLION HITS AND COUNTING.
50 MILLION HITS.
MORE THAN 57 MILLION.
THAT'S RACKED UP MORE THAN 70 MILLION VIEWS.
Jon: HOLY CRAP. THAT IS A HELL OF AN OPEN. 70 MILLION. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF DISNEY SAW THOSE NUMBERS AND DID A QUICK JOHN CARTER REEDIT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S WHAT KONY GETS FOR  MESSING WITH ALL TIM RIGGINS HERE. SOME OF THE MEDIA HAVE CRITICIZED INVISIBLE CHILDREN, THE GROUP BEHIND THE VIDEO FOR FOCUSING THEIR FILM ON RAISING AWARENESS AMONG AMERICAN YOUTH  AS IF THAT AUTOMATICALLY TRANSLATED INTO ACTION OR FOR FACTUAL ISSUES LIKE REPORTING  THAT KONY HAS 30,000 CHILD SOLDIERS WHEN THAT'S THE TOTAL NUMBER HE'S INDUCTED BY THE  L.R.A.OVER 30 YEARS. MAINLY THE MEDIA JUST SEEMS ANNOYED. THAT IT TOOK THIS GUY TO GET PEOPLE TO LISTEN.
A LOT MAJOR NEWS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TALKED ABOUT JOSEPH KONY, TALKED ABOUT THE L.R.A..
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IT FOR YEARS. WE'VE DONE STORY ABOUT IT FOR YEARS. I'VE WORKED IN CENTRAL AFRICA FOR YEARS.
SOMEBODY WHO ASKED PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT THIS LAST OCTOBER AND THERE WAS  VERY LITTLE INTEREST GETTING THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER OUT THERE, VERY LITTLE INTEREST OR  AWARENESS BY THE PUBLIC.
Jon: I MEAN (BEEP). WE'RE HANDSOME. WE'RE ON TV. WHY WON'T RIHANNA RETREAT OUR KONY STORY? IT'S BECAUSE WE STOPPED LISTEN TO GO THE NEWS MEDIA AROUND THE SAME TIME YOU HAD PRINCESS  LEIA ON YOUR ELECTION COVERAGE. EVEN THOUGH JOHNNY HANDSOME HAS THE MUSIC AND THE PRODUCTION VALUE THE VIDEO IS  NOT WITHOUT SOME WEIRDNESS LIKE WHERE THE DIRECTOR EXPLAINS THE WAR LORD TO HIS FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON.
JOSEPH KONY HAS AN ARMY. OKAY? AND WHAT HE DOES IS HE TAKES CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS AND HE GIVES THEM A GUN TO SHOOT. HE MAKES THEM SHOOT AND KILL OTHER PEOPLE.
Jon: GOOD NIGHT, SWEETY. (LAUGHING) BY THE WAY IF YOU ENJOYED THAT CLIP, YOU CAN ORDER THE FILM  MAKER'S WHOLE TIME LIFE SERIES FAMILIES TRAGEDY HORRIBLE HISTORIES MISS MYSTERIES OF  HUMAN ILLNESS. IT INCLUDES CLASSICS LIKE PEOPLE CAN DIE UNEXPECTEDLY AND FOR NO GOOD REASON. SOMETIMES YOU'RE AT THE BEACH AND A GIANT WAVE CAN SWEEP EVERYBODY AWAY. THERE ARE GROUPS CALLED TERRORISTS WHO WANT BOMBS TO KILL EVERYONE. AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SWEETNESS YOU FEEL IS MERELY A BUBBLE YOUR MOM AND I HAVE CREATED. WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE APPRECIATE IT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THE VIDEO HAS GOTTEN A HUGE  REACTION ONLINE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?
TWO WORDS, JON. CYBER BULLYING.
Jon: WAIT.
THAT'S RIGHT. SOME POOR GUY NAMED JOEY MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS IN AFRICA AND SUDDENLY 74 MILLION  PEOPLE ARE MAKING HIM FEEL LIKE AN OUTCAST. AND WHY? BECAUSE HE'S DIFFERENT.
Jon: AL, I DON'T THINK IT'S BECAUSE EELS DIFFERENT.
THIS IS A....
I KNOW, JON. BUT THIS VIDEO IS VERY DANGEROUS.
Jon: HOW IS IT DANGEROUS? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEARNING FROM IT AND WANTING TO GET INVOLVED. IT THREATENS AMERICA'S LONG TRADITION OF IGNORANCE-BASED FOREIGN POLICY. ( APPLAUSE ) SEE GUYS LIKE YOU AND ME, JON, WE CAN BE TRUSTED WITH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TOO TIRED  TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. OUR HOPES AND DREAMS HAVE DIED YEARS AGO.
Jon: YEAH.
WE ARE DEAD INSIDE. BUT YOUNG PEOPLE, I MEAN, THEY THINK THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. AND THEY HAVE THE ENERGY TO DO IT. ALL IT TAKES A ONE HOT DAD ON YOU-TUBE AND SUDDENLY UGANDA IS OUR PROBLEM? YOU KNOW, DRUG GANGS ARE DOING THE SAME (BEEP) DOWN IN MEXICO AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
LET'S JUST HOPE NOBODY MAKES A CATCHY VIDEO ABOUT IT OR THE YOUNGS WILL BE UP OUR  COOL-OS... THAT MEANS DO SOMETHING (BEEP).
Jon: I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE OVERREACTING HERE. I DON'T THINK YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THAT IMPRESSIONABLE. LET'S BRING IN JESSICA WILLIAMS OUR SENIOR YOUTH CORRESPONDENT TO GET HER TAKE.
DID YOU SEE THIS KONY VIDEO? WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GUY. WHO WANTS TO GO ALL NIGHT WITH ME AND HANG UP SOME POSTERS? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: DUDE, THIS IS SERIOUS.
I TOLD YOU. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE POWERLESS BEFORE VIRAL VIDEOS. IT'S HOW THEY LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO WANT US TO CARE ABOUT?
THINK? WATCH THIS. HEY, JESSICA,.
YEAH.
TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT SYRIA.
SYRIA. OH, YES, HE TELLS ME WHAT TO DO WHEN I'M TALKING TO MY PHONE.
Jon: SYRIA IS A COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AN UPRISING THERE IS BEING BRUTALLY SUPPRESSED. MANY ARE DYING. SHE DIDN'T GIVE A (BEEP) ABOUT SYRIA.
JON, ALLOW ME. HEY, JESSICA. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT NEW VIDEO WITH THE DOG?
WHAT? A NEW VIDEO WITH A DOG. COUNT ME IN.
SYRIA. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT? THE ARAB SPRING CAME AND THE SYRIANS STARTEDED PROTESTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS.
COOL. FREEDOM IS GREAT.
FREEDOM IS GREAT.
BUT THERE'S A STILL CALLS HOMS.
NORTH OF LEBANON, SURE.
PEOPLE THERE PROTESTED AND THE ARMY SHOWED UP.
YEAH. INSTEAD OF LETTING THE SYRIANS VOICE THEIR DISCONTENT THEY STARTED SHELLING HOMS.
IT'S A WAR CRIME. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SYRIA. DO SOMETHING WITH SYRIA.
LET ME CHECK ON THAT.
Jon: WELL DONE. AL MADRIGAL. JESSICA WILLIAMS, YOU WERE RIGHT. I HAD NO IDEA.
