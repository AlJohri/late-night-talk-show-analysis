Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE TALKING HERE WITH VICE  PRESIDENT AL GORE. WE'RE TALKING EARLIER. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING  PIECES IN THE BOOK IS THIS IDEA  OF SUSTAINABLE CAPITALISM.
YES.
Jon: WHICH IS DIFFICULT  BECAUSE IT'S LOOK BY DEFINITION  A VORACIOUS OVEREATER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND AS  DIFFICULT AS THAT IS TO PRACTICE  BECAUSE AGAIN YOU COULD HAVE SOLD IT TO SOMEBODY NOT INVOLVED  IN OIL BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE  GOTTEN AS MUCH FOR SHARE HOLD YERCHLZ I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY  FOR SHAREHOLDERS AND EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE TWO POWERFUL TOOLS TO  SHAPE THE FUTURE. ONE IS DEMOCRACY AND THE OTHER  IS CAPITALISM. THE ALTERNATIVES TO DEMOCRACY  HAVE BEEN TRIED TO AND FOUND  DISASTROUS.

Jon: WHEN HAS TIME? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SECOND.
ABSOLUTELY. CAPITALISM THE WAY IT'S  OPERATING NOW REALLY NEEDS TO BE  REFORMED. OUR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN HACKED. IT'S BEEN TAKEN OVER. IT NO LONGER OPERATES THE WAY  OUR FOUNDERS INTENDED IT TO  BECAUSE ANONYMOUS DONORS, BIG MONEY, CORPORATIONS AS PEOPLE,  MIGHT MAKES RIGHT, THE LOBITY  L-YISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE IN CONTROL. THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT  BEGGING PERMISSION FROM THE  POWERFUL SPECIAL INTEREST. IT'S TIME WE TAKE OUR DEMOCRACY  BACK. KIT BE DONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- IT CAN BE DONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HERE ISER IS WHAT WE'RE  GOING TO DO. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
YEAH.
Jon: THE FUTURE. WE'LL TALK WITH THE BOOK AND THE  COMPLICATIONS AND THE  DIFFICULTIES OF IT. AL GORE WILL BE BACK ON THE
