Jon:  WELCOME BACK. LAST NIGHT BROUGHT A BIG STORM  TO ( BLEEP ) MOUNTAIN OF WHICH  THE CITIZENS WERE UNREPAIRED HAVING RELIED ON THEIR INTERNAL  FORECAST. THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS AND AFTER  THE INITIAL PANIC OVER THE  NUMBER DECIDE THE PARTY OF PERSON RESPONSIBILITY DID WHAT  IS ITT DOES BEST-- FIGURE OUT  WHY IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT. SUBJECT NUMBER ONE, THE MEDIA.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA FAVORS  OBAMA.
THE NUMBERS FROM THE EXIT  POLLING SEEMED TO MIRROR OR  PARROT THE LIBERAL MEDIA.
WHEN YOU HAVE THE NATIONAL  MEDIA WORKING COMPULSE EIFFEL  YOUR BEHALF IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BREAK THIEW THE NOISE TO THE  REALITY.
Jon:  SURE, AND EVEN  THOUGH THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER  FOUND THE MEDIA WAS BEING ABOUT EQUALLY NEGATIVE TOW BEATING  CANDIDATES IN THE RUN-UP TO  ELECTION DAY, THAT STORY ITSELF WAS REPORTED IN...  ♪ ♪ ♪  THE MEDIA. ( LAUGHTER )  AND DON'T THINK GOD IS GETTING  OFF THE HOOK IN THIS ELECTION.
I DO THINK THAT THE STORM  THREW A MONKEY WRENCH IN MITT  ROMNEY'S MOMENTUM BECAUSE IT DISRUPTED THE STORY LINE.
ONE PHOTO OP WALKING OVER A 2  XES ABOUT 4 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN  HE'S HANDLE A STORM.
Jon:  IF ONLY PRESIDENT  BUSH COULD HAVE BEEN SO LUCK TOW  HAVE A MASSIVE HURRICANE ON HIS WATCH HE'S! OH, RIGHT. STILL THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW  COULD A NETWORK AS IN TOUCH WITH  THE COMMON MAN FAIL TO SEE WHAT WAS COMING?
DICK, WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT CHANGED? WHAT. YOUR MODEL COMPARED TO THE  REALITY?
WELL, I'M BURR ED IN A  MUDSLIDE.
Jon:  HEY, I GOT NEWS FOR  YOU, BUDDY. THAT AIN'T MUD. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  BUT DON'T BLAME DICK. BLAME THE DEMOGRAPHICS.
THIS IS THE NEW AMERICA. THIS ISN'T YOUR FATHER'S  AMERICA. WE ARE NOW IN A TURNOUT MOD  THEY'LL IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT  THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. BLACKS ARE NOW 13% OF THE VOTE,  NOT 11. LATINOS ARE 10, NOT 8. THE PREVIOUS NUMBERS WERE THE  '04 MODEL AND I THOUGHT THINGS  WOULD RETURN TO THAT. THEY DIDN'T.
Jon:  I THOUGHT THE  MINORITIES WHO VOTE NOD 2008  WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED BY NOW ( LAUGHTER )  I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WOULD  RETURN TO THEIR HOME PLANETS OR  REACH THEIR EXPIRATION DATE, AND DISSOLVE INTO WHATEVER  MINORITIES ARE MADE OF. SOMETHING. BUT TURNS OUT THEY STILL EXIST  IN HUMAN FORM. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT THE REAL PROBLEM HERE WASN'T  THE VOTERS' INEXPLICABLE  DECISION TO BE LESS WHITE. IT WAS THE RUTHLESS OBAMA SMEAR  MACHINE.
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN RUNNING A  VERY AGGRESSIVE EARLY EFFORT TO  CHARACTERIZE MITT ROMNEY AS A CORPORATE RAIDER AND HIS TIME AT  BAIN CAPITAL.
THAT HE WAS A VULTURE,  VAMPIRE, VULTURE CAPITALIST.
Jon:  IT WAS SO UNFAIR! I MEAN, WHERE DID THAT STUFF  COME FROM ANYWAY?
THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN VENTURE CAPITALISM AND  VULTURE CAPITALISM.
PRETTY HARD TO JUSTIFY RICH  PEOPLE FIGURING OUT CLEVER LEGAL  WAYS TO LOOT A COMPANY.
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS  COMPANY WANTS TO ELECT A WALL  STREET FINANCIER.
THERE WAS A STEEL MILL THAT  BAIN SWEPT IN, TOOK THAT COMPANY  OVER.
BAIN SOMETIMES BEHAVED IN  BEHAVIOR WHERE THEY LOOTED A  COUPLE AND LEFT BEHIND 1700 UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE.
Jon:  DAMN YOU, OBAMA! THAT'S COMING FROMMED IN YOUR  OWN HOUSE. AND EVEN THE RIGHT'S BELOVED  SUPER PAC DESIGNED TO DO TO  OBAMA WHAT OBAMA DID TO ROMNEY  BACKFIRED. REMEMBER AIDLE SON, LAS VEGAS  BILLIONAIRE? SAID HE'S GIVE UP TO $100  MILLION TO HELP ROMNEY DEFEAT  THE SOCIALIST OBAMA? WHY DID HE HAVE TO GIVE SO MUCH  MONEY? BECAUSE HE GAVE SO MUCH TO  GINGRICH IN THE PRIMARIES TO  DEFEAT VULTURE CAPITALIST ROMNEY, THE HALF-HOUR BAIN  ATTACK AD WAS PRODUCED AND  DISTRIBUTED BY ROMNEY SUGAR DADDY SHELDON AIDLE SON. IT WASN'T MURDER. IT WAS AUTO EROTICA  ASPHYXIATION. THE HIGHLIGHT OF FOX'S TOTAL  MELTED DOWN FOR ME-- AND THERE  WERE A LOT OF HIGHLIGHTS. I'M A BIT OF A CONNOISSEUR-- WAS  TO SEE WHERE THEY ULTIMATELY  LANDED. THE PLACE THEY COULD GO TO IN  THEIR OWN MINDS TO RATIONALIZE  THE UTTER DESTRUCTION OF BULL ( BLEEP ) MOUNTAIN.
IT WAS ALMOST FOUR YEARS OF  DIVISION AND CLASS WARFARE. WE NEED TO HOPE AND PRAY THAT  THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS NOW  THAT, THAT POLICY IS DIVISIVE, AND THAT POLICY IS DESTRUCTIVE  TO THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED  STATES.
LET'S HOPE A LESSON HAS BEEN  LEARNED, AND HE SURPRISES WITH  US SOME MODERATION.
HOPE IS IMPORTANT.
Jon:  YES, LET THIS ARE  SOUNDING VICTORY WE BARACK OBAMA  BE A LESSON TO THE PRESIDENT! IF YOU DON'T MODERATE YOUR  POSITIONS, YOU MAY NOT WIN THAT
