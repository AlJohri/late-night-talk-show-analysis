( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WE TURN NOW TO THE  ONGOING CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TALK  ABOUT MICHAEL DOUGLAS' CANCER  LINGUS. ( LAUGHTER )  ALL RIGHT, WE'RE DOING SYRIA. I'M SORRY. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE COMPLEX AND  MURKY SITUATION THAT MAKES IT  DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW THE UNITED STATES SHOULD GET INVOLVED.
IN TERMS OF ARMING THE  REBELES, ONE OF THE CONCERNS  CERTAINTY THE ADMINISTRATION HAD IS THAT WEAPONS WILL FALL INTO  THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS, OR  EXTREMISTS WHO ARE THERE NOW. HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE  CHAIRMAN MIKE ROGERS SAID EVERY  FLAVOR OF TERRORIST IS OPERATING IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW.
Jon:  EVERY FLAVOR! ( LAUGHTER )  JUR ROCKY ROADSIDE BOMB, THERE. YOUR CHUBBY HEZBOLLAH. ( LAUGHTER )  AND, OF COURSE, EVERYONE'S  FAVORITE, VANIL-LA-LA-LA-LA! ( APPLAUSE )  FORTUNATELY--  ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME DAYS  TO COME BACK. FORTUNATELY, THERE'S ONE MAN OUT  THERE WHO'S GOT AN EASY ANSWER.
HOW DO YOU PREVENT WEAPONS  FROM FALLING INTO THEIR HANDS?
WELL, BY IDENTIFYING THOSE  PEOPLE WHO ARE ON OUR SIDE. WE CAN IDENTIFY WHO THESE PEOPLE  ARE. WE CAN HELP THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
Jon:  SAVE US,  OBE-GRUMP-KANOBE. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE. BUT CAN HE?
OVERSEAS TONIGHT WAY SURPRISE  VISIT TO SYRIA TONIGHT SENATOR  JOHN McCAIN SPENDING THIS MEMORIAL DAY MEETING WITH THE  REBEL FIGHTERS IN SYRIA, THE  ONES TRYING TO BRING DOWN PRESIDENT ASSAD.
Jon:  THAT MEANS IT'S  TIME FOR ANOTHER EPISODE OF--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  THERE'S NO WAY, NO  WAY THAT McCAIN MAKES IT OUT  OF THERE ALIVE THIS TIME, OR DOES HE?
HE WENT WAY HAND FULL OF  AMERICAN SECURITY, THE REBELS  SECURED YOUR ENTRANCE INTO  SYRIA. THAT TAKES GUTS!
OH, NO, LOOK, ONE THING I'M  SURE OF IS I'M PROBABLY GOING TO  DIE SOME TIME BUT IT'S GOING TO BE IN BED. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  MAYBE WITH A  SYRINGE OF MALAYSIAN WHITE TIGER  HEROIN. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ON ONE  OF THOSE IF YOU TONS. IT WILL BE ON ONE OF THOSE SPACE  BED WHERE YOU CAN PUT A GLAFS  WINE AND JUMP UP AND DOWN. MEMORY SPHOAM I THINK THEY  CALLED IT. HE WENT TO SYRIA TO SHOW THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HUFT JHOW  FAST EASY IT IS TO SHOW THE GOOD GUYS FROM THE BAD GUYS, AND ALL  WORKED ACCORDING TO PLAN EXCEPT.
ACCORDING TO A REPORT,  SENATOR McCAIN CAN BE SEEN IN  THAT PICTURE POSING ALONGSIDE TWO MEN WHO MAY BE BEHIND THE  KIDNAPPING OF 11 LEBANESE SHIITE  MUSLIMS JUST LAST YEAR. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  OH, MY GOD, JOHN  McCAIN IS LITERALLY PALGING  AROUND WITH THEM. HIS OFFICE HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD  EXPLANATION OF HOW THIS MIGHT  HAVE HAPPENED. APPARENTLY, NONE OF THE  ALEXANDERS HE PLANNED TO MEET  WITH WAS IDENTIFIED AS MOHAMMED NOOR OR ABU IBRAHIM. WHICH IS KIND OF THE POINT. IT'S A MURKY SITUATION AND NOT  EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE WEARING  THEIR "HELLO, I'M A TERRORIST," NAME BADGE. ( LAUGHTER )  OR THEIR "ASK ME ABOUT MY  KIDNAPPING" BUTTON.
McCAIN'S OFFICE PUT OUT A  STATEMENT. I'LL INTERESTED TO YOU, "A  NUMBER OF THE SIR QLOONS GREETED  SENATOR McCAIN UPON HIS ARRIVAL IN SYRIA ASKED TO TAKE  PICTURES WITH HIM AND AS ALWAYS  THE SENATOR COMPLIED. IF THE INDIVIDUAL PHOTOGRAPHED  WITH SENATOR McCAIN IS IN FACT  MOHAMMED NOOR, THAT IS REGRETTABLE."
Jon:  YES, THAT IS  REEXWRETTABLE REGRETTABLE. SOMEONE GOT INTO THE PICTURE  EVEN THOUGH SENATOR McCAIN  NEVER INTENDED TO MEET WITH HIM OH, MY GOSH, SENATOR McCAIN IS  THE VICTIM OF A TERRORIST PHOTO  BOMBING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
