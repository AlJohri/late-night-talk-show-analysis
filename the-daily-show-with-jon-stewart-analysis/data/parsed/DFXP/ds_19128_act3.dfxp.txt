[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SO, WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING WITH HILLARY CLINTON. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE FACE. SO WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THESE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS.
RIGHT.
Jon: YOU'VE SEEN IT WHEN YOU WERE IN THE OVAL OFFICE AS FIRST LADY. YOU'VE SEEN IT AS SENATOR IN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
Jon: YOU WERE IN THE CABINET.
YEP.
Jon: HAS THE BUREAUCRACY OF GOVERNMENT BECOME UNMANAGEABLE TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS NO LONGER ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY RAISE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT IT IS TRYING TO DO SO?
WELL, JON, I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH A CONGRESS THAT IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY AND A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION IN OUR EXECUTIVE BRANCH BECAUSE I THINK IF PRESIDENT OBAMA WERE HERE, I THINK HE WOULD SAY IT HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE TIMES. WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF AGILITY AND FLEXIBILITY AND TECHNOLOGY. SO THE BUREAUCRACY MOVES SLOWLY. THE CONGRESS IS GRIDLOCKED. SO WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR DEMOCRACY. AND WHAT I SAW GOING TO 112 COUNTRIES IS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE FUNCTION IN THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK TO US. OUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN THE BEACON FOR SO MANY YEARS, LIKE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. GUESS WHAT, PEOPLE WANT TO COME HERE BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'LL BE SAFE, THEY'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE TO MANAGE IT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT CONGRESS SHOULD PASS.
Jon: BUT IS OUR EXPECTATION, OUR EXPECTATION OF OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW, TECHNOLOGY AS WE BECOME LESS AGILE, TECHNOLOGY HAS DEMOCRATIZED POWER TO A LARGE EXTENT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: YOU SEE VERY SMALL GROUPS WHO ARE ABLE TO SOW A GREAT DEAL OF DESTRUCTIVE FORCE, AND IS AMERICA, YOU KNOW, WE ARE A LARGE IMPERIAL POWER. AND THE IDEA THAT WE CAN EXERCISE THAT POWER IN THE SAME MANNER AS WE SEE IN, YOU KNOW WHAT, IS OUR FOREIGN POLICY ANYMORE?
YEAH, YEAH. WELL, THAT'S REALLY WHY THIS BOOK IS SOMETHING THAT I PUT MY HEART AND SOUL INTO, BECAUSE WE CAN'T PRACTICE DIPLOMACY AND DEFINE OUR FOREIGN POLICY AS LEADERS TALKING TO LEADERS ANYMORE. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS. EXACTLY AS YOU SAID. PEOPLE ARE EMPOWERED FROM THE BOTTOM UP. AND WHAT I FOUND WHEN I BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY HAD NO MEMORY OF THE UNITED STATES LIBERATING EUROPE AND ASIA, BEATING THE NAZIS, FIGHTING THE, YOU KNOW, COLD WAR AND WINNING. THAT WAS JUST ANCIENT HISTORY. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE SACRIFICES THAT WE HAD MADE AND THE VALUES THAT MOTIVATED US TO DO IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE HAVE NOT BEEN TELLING OUR STORY VERY WELL. WE DO HAVE A GREAT STORY. WE ARE NOT PERFECT BY ANY MEANS, BUT WE HAVE A GREAT STORY ABOUT HUMAN FREEDOM, HUMAN RIGHTS, HUMAN OPPORTUNITY, AND LET'S GET BACK TO TELLING IT TO OURSELVES FIRST AND FOREMOST AND BELIEVING IT ABOUT OURSELVES AND THEN TAKING THAT AROUND THE WORLD. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE STANDING FOR.
Jon: CAN WE EXPECT OTHER COUNTRIES TO VIEW US WITH SUCH NUANCE WHEN WE SO CLEARLY DON'T VIEW THEM WITH NUANCE AND WITH THAT TYPE OF UNDERSTANDING?
THAT'S A, THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION, BECAUSE...
Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. [LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE?
Jon: BECAUSE.
BECAUSE WE DID A MUCH BETTER JOB TELLING THE WORLD WHO WE WERE BACK IN THE COLD WAR. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A SIMPLER JOB, TO BE FAIR. WE HAD THE SOVIET UNION. WE HAD THE UNITED STATES. WE HAD A BIG INFORMATION EFFORT. WE SENT, WE SENT TALENT, WE SENT ALL KINDS OF POETS AND NOVELISTS AND ROCK STARS. I REMEMBER WHEN VACLAV HAVEL, THE GREAT DISSIDENT AND THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC TOLD ME THAT LOU REED HAD BEEN HIS INSPIRATION. AMERICAN CULTURE, AMERICAN IDEAS PERMEATED THE WORLD. WELL, FAST FORWARD. THAT ENDED, AND WE KIND OF THOUGHT, OKAY, FINE, END OF HISTORY, DEMOCRACY WON. YOU KNOW THAT STORY. AND IN FACT, WE WITHDREW FROM THE INFORMATION ARENA. AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED INITIALLY WITH UKRAINE. RUSSIAN MEDIA WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IN SORT OF TELLING A STORY: IT WASN'T TRUE, BUT THEY KEPT REPEATING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO A CONSENSUS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND FOR, AND THEN GET OUT THERE AND, YOU KNOW, TELL THAT STORY.
Jon: "HARD CHOICES." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE WEB. SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
