(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WE'RE BACK WITH PERVEZ MUSHARRAF. SIR, NOW, OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, WE NEED EACH OTHER, CLEARLY WE NEED EACH OTHER IN THIS REGION, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE A PLAN. AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS... OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT A GENERAL, I'M NOT INVOLVED IN HIGH-LEVEL INTELLIGENCE. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE MAY BE LEAVING AFGHANISTAN WITHIN THE NEXT 50 OR 60 YEARS. (LAUGHTER) AND IF THAT OCCURS, WHAT IS PAKISTAN'S INTEREST IN THE  TALIBAN IN THAT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE SITUATION THAT, AS YOU SEE IT WITH OUR MAYBE PULLING  BACK A LITTLE BIT?
THAT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE TO BE CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY TO... IT  WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON PAKISTAN. IF YOU QUIT IN 2014, WHATEVER HAS BEEN DECLARED, OBVIOUSLY THE BEST STRATEGY FOR THE TALIBAN OR  THE ENEMY, AL QAEDA AND TALIBAN, IS TO LIE LOW, LET TIME PASS, AND THEN RISE AGAIN. SO DECLARING... GIVING A TIMELINE, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE  EFFECTED, WHAT EFFECTS DO WE WANT TO CREATE? YOU CAN'T HAVE IT TIME RELATED BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL BE IN THE  HANDS OF THE ENEMY, I WOULD SAY. AND IF YOU LEAVE IN 2014 WITHOUT STABILIZING AFGHANISTAN, WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN? WE NEED TO VISUALIZE.
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS... THE DIFFICULTY I THINK FOR AMERICA IS AFGHANISTAN HASN'T BEEN  STABLE SINCE, I GUESS, HANNIBAL. (LAUGHTER) SO THE IDEA THAT WE COULD STAY THERE... (LAUGHTER). THEY DON'T APPEAR TO WANT TO BE STABILIZED SO I MEAN... I GUESS  THE PROBLEM IS CAN WE REALLY DO THAT? CAN WE DO THAT FOR A COUNTRY AND IS PAKISTAN GOING TO GIVE THEM THE ROOM THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO  DO THAT OR WOULD THEY PERHAPS TRY AND HAVE SOME INFLUENCE WITH THE TALIBAN ADDS WELL?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK AFGHANISTAN WAS STABLE SINCE CENTURIES.
Jon: WELL, OBVIOUSLY I WAS BEING HUMERUS. (LAUGHTER) ... HUMOROUS.
THEY HAD AN AGREEMENT. THE ETHNIC GROUPS DECIDED TO STAY TOGETHER UNDER THE MONARCHY. THE PROBLEMS STARTED 1979 WHEN THE MONARCH WAS... WHEN THE KING WAS DEPOSED AND THAT'S WHERE  THIS... WHERE THE WAR THAT THEY HAD, THAT GLUE THAT HELD THEM TOGETHER WAS NO MORE THAN THERE  AND THE TROUBLE STARTED WHEN THE SOVIETS CAME IN. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO REPAIR NOW. AND, INDEED, THEY ARE NOT A COUNTRY WHICH CAN HAVE DEMOCRACY AS ENOUGH THE UNITED STATES BUT  THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR OWN FORM OF DEMOCRACY TAILORED TO THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS, GOVERNANCE, TAIL ORRED TO AN AFGHANISTAN ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE THERE.
WELL, LET'S... WE'RE GOING TO GO... CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR  ABOUT FIVE, TEN MINUTES AND WE CAN TALK ON THE INTERWEBS? PERVEZ MUSHARRAF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE. (CHEERS AND
