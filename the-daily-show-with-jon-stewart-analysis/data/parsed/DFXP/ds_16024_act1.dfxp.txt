FEBRUARY 17, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GREAT PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING HERE IN... NO? IT'S LIKE 60 DEGREES OUTSIDE TODAY, ISN'T IT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THOUGHT IT WAS NICE. (LAUGHTER) FORMER R.N.C. CHAIR ED GILLESPIE IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TODAY  TO ASK WHY WE NEVER MADE A MUPPET OF HIM. (LAUGHTER) WE NEVER THOUGHT OF I IT. STEELE WAS SO MUCH MORE OF A COMPELLING FELT FIGURE. (LAUGHTER) BUT FIRST, WE'VE ALL BEEN MOVED BY THE IMAGES FROM THE MIDDLE  EAST, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NON-AMERICAN FLAG BURNING CITIZENS CRY OUT FOR NEW LEADERSHIP. PEOPLE DRIVEN INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE BY YEARS OF REPRESSIVE RULE. AND THEN THERE'S ITALY.
A DAY OF PROTEST CALLING FOR AN ENTRENCHED LEADER TO STEP DOWN.
ONE BANNER READS "RESIGN AND GET YOUR HEAD CHECKED." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FINALLY IT APPEARS THE ITALIAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF SILVIO BERLUSCONI. THROUGH THREE TERMS AND ABOUT NINE YEARS AS ITALY'S PRIME MINISTER, THROUGH A TAX FRAUD  CASE RELATING TO A SPANISH TELEVISION COMPANY, THROUGH AN INFLUENCE PEDDLING SCANDAL  CONCERNING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS ARE. THROUGH ALLEGATION OF BRIBERY, EMBEZZLEMENT, TIES TO ORGANIZED CRIME, USING OLIVE OIL THAT WAS NOT EXACTLY VIRGIN. (LAUGHTER) ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE DE-EMPHASIZED THANKS TO A NEAR MONOPOLY BERLUSCONI HOLDS ON  ITALY'S NEWS MEDIA AND RENDERED MOOT ANYWAY BY A LAW BERLUSCONI PASSED EXEMPTING HIMSELF FROM  PROSECUTION WHILE IN OFFICE. NOW I KNOW WHY VENICE IS SINKING IT'S UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SILVIO  BERLUSCONI'S GIANT BALLS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THEY'RE GIGANTIC. I WAS IN ONE OF THEM ONCE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GONDOLA. (LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE. (LAUGHTER) I'M IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S PANTS. (LAUGHTER) BUT APPARENTLY ONLY NOW-- ONLY NOW-- HAS HE GONE TOO FAR.
THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER, SILVIO BERLUSCONI, WHO COMMENTED TODAY ON CHARGES HE HAD SEX WITH AN UNDERAGE PROSECUTE AT ONE OF  HIS BUNGA BUNGA SEX PARTIES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FOCUSING ON THE COMPOUND ADJECTIVE BUNGA-BUNGA. BUT IF I MAY, I'D LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE EARLIER PHRASE "WITH AN UNDERAGE  PROSTITUTE." WHICH IS ONE OF THE RARE PHRASES THAT SOUNDS NO MORE ROMANTIC IN  ITS NATURAL ITALIAN. I BELIEVE THE PHRASE IS "A-STATUTORIO-RAPE." (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE, BERLUSCONI NOW MUST  BE VERY WORRIED.
BERLUSCONI DENIES THE CHARGES IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT ON  THE ISSUE SINCE THE JUDGE'S ORDER. HE SAID, AMONG OTHER THINGS, "I AM NOT WORRIED IN THE LEAST."
Jon: WOW. NOTHING STICKS TO THIS GUY. WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE, AFTER ALL THE ALLEGATIONS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM, IT SEEMS LIKE HE WOULD BE QUITE STICKY. (LAUGHTER) THE GUY'S LIKE CHARLIE SHEEN WITH DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND INSTEAD OF RAISING HALF A MAN, HE'S RUNNING ITALY. LET'S HEAR FROM ONE OF BERLUSCONI'S LOVE-AGE FRIENDS WITH BUNGA FITS.
HOW MUCH MONEY DID HE GIVE YOU?
IT DOESN'T MATTER. THAT'S NOT THE MATTER.
WELL, SOME PEOPLE SAY IT DOES MATTER BECAUSE IT WOULD SUGGEST  THAT HE WAS EITHER PAYING FOR YOUR SERVICES OR PAYING TO KEEP YOU QUIET.
OR HE WAS HELPING ME JUST BECAUSE HE CARED FOR ME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH. YEAH. YOU'RE LIKE THE DAUGHTER HE NEVER (BEEP)ED. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE OF THE BERLUSCONI CASE STARTING WITH  OLIVIA MUNN IN ROME. OLIVIA? (WITH ITALIAN ACCENT.
HE'S NOT GUILTY. MY SILVIO, HE'S GOOD BOY. HE NO A-RAPE, NO TOUCH-A. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OLIVIA, VERY ENJOYABLE COMICAL STEREOTYPE THE OLD ITALIAN MOTHER WEEPING. VERY NICE. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HERE. WE PAY YOU TO REPORT. WE DON'T PAY FOR COSTUMES, ACCENTS AND SOME MARINARA FARCE. I NEED INFORMATION! I'M GOING TO GO TO ONE OF OUR MORE ESTABLISHED PEOPLE, BBC-TRAINED JOHN OLIVER IN MILAN WITH... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. PLEASE DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO A REPORT FROM THE  PERSPECTIVE OF THE PUT-UPON YOUNG PIZZA MAKER.
NO, NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT, JON. THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT APPEARS TO BE FRESH PIZZA DOUGH?
WHAT DOES?
Jon: DO YOU HAVE AN INFORMATIVE REAL REPORT, JOHN?
SURE, JUST GIVE ME A SECOND. WILL AN ITALIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM CORRUPTED BY YEARS OF BERLUSCONI'S INFLUENCE ONCE  AGAIN GIVE HIM A PASS OR, JON, WILL HE FINALLY HAVE TO FACE THE MUSIC?
Jon: NO, NO, NO! NO, DON'T DO IT! ♪ O, SOLE MIO... ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ ♪
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THIS NOW, HE WANTS A REGULAR REPORT.
♪ YOU SAID MUSIC WAS MY CUE... ♪ (LAUGHTER)
JOHN, OPERATION A-SPACEY MEAT-A-BALL-A, IS NO GO. I'M SORRY, JOHN. I TRIED TO STOP HIM. I HONESTLY DID.
Jon: THANKS VERY MUCH,
