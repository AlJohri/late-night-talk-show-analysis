[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "SOLDIER GIRLS: THE BATTLES OF THREE WOMEN AT HOME AND AT WAR." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM HELEN THORPE. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
IT'S VERY NICE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IT'S MY PLEASURE.
Jon: WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK. "SOLDIER GIRLS." YOU KNOW, WAR STORIES ARE SO DIFFICULT TO TELL BENEATH THE KIND OF THE TENT POST OR CARICATURED VISION...
YEAH.
Jon: THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOR IT. TO TELL THE STORY OF WOMEN AT WAR. IT'S SUCH A DIFFERENT PLACE TO GO WITH IT.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND IT REALLY, THE BOOK FEELS VERY FRESH IN THAT WAY.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: HOW LONG DID YOU FOLLOW AND HOW DID YOU CHOOSE THE WOMEN THAT YOU FOLLOWED?
SO I MET THEM FIRST IN 2010. AND AT THAT POINT THEY HAD ALREADY DONE TWO TOURS OF DUTY AND WERE BACK. AND I SPOKE TO THEM. ACTUALLY, FOR FOUR YEARS. THE WHOLE PROJECT TOOK FOUR YEARS. SO THEY WENT THROUGH HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS OF INTERVIEWS WITH ME.
Jon: VERY REVEALING. BY THE WAY...
YEAH.
Jon: THEIR COURAGE NOT ONLY TO GO INTO THOSE WAR ZONES, BUT IN THE WAY THEY DISCUSS THEIR LIVES.
I THOUGHT THEY WERE INCREDIBLY BRAVE AND CANDID. THEY SHARED WITH ME LETTERS AND E-MAILS AND DIARIES, EVEN THERAPY NOTES.
Jon: AND IT WAS INTERESTING, THEIR CHALLENGES WERE DIFFERENT.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU HAD ONE WOMAN WHO HAD THREE CHILDREN...
RIGHT.
Jon: ANOTHER WHO WAS SINGLE.
YEAH.
Jon: ANOTHER WHO WAS GOING TO BE A GRANDMOTHER.
RIGHT.
Jon: I MEAN, THERE WAS A, EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL KNEW EACH OTHER...
YEAH.
Jon: THEY COME FROM VERY DIFFERENT PLACES.
RIGHT, REALLY DIFFERENT LIFE STAGES. SO I MET THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE WOMEN FIRST. HER NAME IN THE BOOK IS MICHELLE FISHER. AND UM...
Jon: WHICH IS NOT HER NAME IN THE WORLD.
IT'S NOT HER REAL NAME. SHE ASKED FOR A PSEUDONYM.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND ABOUT HALF THE INDIVIDUALS I INTERVIEWED WANTED TO USE PSEUDONYMS. SO SHE, MICHELLE FISHER WAS 18 IN THE SPRING OF 2001. SHE DID NOT THINK OF HERSELF AS A SOLDIER OR SOMEBODY WHO WANTED TO JOIN THE MILITARY, BUT HER MOM WAS ON AND OFF WELFARE AND HER DAD WAS IN AND OUT OF PRISON, AND SHE REALLY WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW COULD SHE GO TO COLLEGE AND HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LIFE. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DO FACTORY WORK, WHICH IS WHAT WAS AVAILABLE. AND, SO SHE WALKED INTO THE RECRUITING OFFICE FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD AND SIGNED UP REALLY INTENDING TO BE A PART-TIME SOLDIER. AND THEN, WHEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING, 9/11 HAPPENED, AND SHE GOT RIGHT AWAY THAT HER LIFE WAS GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFERENT.
Jon: I THOUGHT WHAT WAS MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS IN THE BOOKS THAT I'VE READ ABOUT MALE EXPERIENCE IN WAR, THERE'S A CERTAIN CAMARADERIE THAT YOU NEVER GET BENEATH, BUT THIS OPENS UP A DOOR TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SOLDIERS THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT AND FRAUGHT WITH A LOT MORE COMPLICATION...
YEAH.
Jon: IN TERMS OF INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
RIGHT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, OUT OF MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIPS, DRINKING. LIKE, IT IS A LOT MORE... THERE'S A LOT MORE DEPTH TO IT.
SO THESE WOMEN WERE, YOU KNOW, DEPLOYED ON THESE MULTIPLE LENGTHY DEPLOYMENTS, FIRST TO AFGHANISTAN, THEN TO IRAQ, AND THE WORK THEY WERE DOING WAS FIXING BROKEN AK-47S IN AFGHANISTAN AS WEAPONS MECHANICS OR IN DESMA'S CASE, WHEN SHE'S IN IRAQ, DRIVING A  GUN TRUCK AT THE FRONT OF A SUPPLY CONVOY. AND THEN TO RELIEVE THE STRESS THAT THEY WERE UNDER FROM THESE, YOU KNOW, LENGTHY DEPLOYMENTS AT HOME, FEELING ISOLATED AND LONELY TWO OF THE WOMEN DID HAVE AFFAIRS WITH MEN WHO WERE MARRIED WHO WERE THEIR COLLEAGUES, AND ONE WOMAN ENDS UP DRINKING. SHE WANTS A COCKTAIL AT THE END OF EVERY DAY AND SHE ENDS UP RELYING ON ALCOHOL TO SORT OF GET HER THROUGH THE DEPLOYMENT.
Jon: AND IT WAS INTERESTING, TOO, BECAUSE THEY WERE YOU KNOW, THEY'RE A BIT OF A RARE COMMODITY OVER THERE, SO THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT THE MALES ARE KIND OF FIGHTING FOR THEIR ATTENTION...
YEAH.
Jon: IN WAYS WANTED BUT ALSO UNWANTED, AND IT SHOWS THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE IN HAVING TO NAVIGATE EVEN FORGET ABOUT THE ENEMY ENVIRONMENT...
RIGHT.
Jon: THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT.
YEAH. SO BECAUSE THEY'RE SERVING IN A MIXED-GENDER BATTALION, THE RATIO IS LIKE 2-1 ROUGHLY IN THEIR OWN BATTALION,
Jon: RIGHT.
MEN TO WOMEN. BUT THEY'RE ON A MILITARY POST ALONGSIDE OF ALL-MALE INFANTRY SOLDIERS OR FOREIGN SOLDIERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALL MALE, SO THE RATIO ON THE POST ITSELF IS EVEN MORE SKEWED MANY MORE MEN TO WOMEN, AND THEY ARE SCARCE COMMODITY. THE YOUNGEST IN THE BOOK, THE YOUNGEST WOMAN, MICHELLE, IS FINDING THAT EVERYWHERE SHE GOES, THE MEN ARE READING THE NAME TAG ON HER ARMY UNIFORM AND CALLING OUT TO HER BY NAME AS IF THEY KNOW HER, SO FROM THE MOMENT SHE LEAVES HER TENT UNTIL SHE GETS BACK TO HER TENT AT NIGHT, IT'S NON-STOP ATTENTION. AND THEN YOU HAVE DEBBIE, WHO IS 30 YEARS OLDER, SHE'S IN HER EARLY 50S, AND SHE'S LOOKING ON THINKING, WOW, IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE I GOT THAT KIND OF ATTENTION AND SHE'S NOT GETTING QUITE THAT SORT OF ATTENTION, AND YOU CAN SEE IT FROM DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINTS DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE.
Jon: RIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S,  THAT'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT. AND IT GIVES A VIEW ALMOST FROM A 180 OF WHAT WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO. AND, IT'S A VERY VALUABLE ADDITION IN THAT WAY IT SEEMS.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: WELL, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.
PLEASURE.
Jon: AND SHARING IT WITH US. HAVE THE WOMEN READ IT? HAVE THEY?
I ACTUALLY GAVE THEM THE MANUSCRIPT BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED SO THEY COULD READ IT.
Jon: OH OK.
I WANTED... YOU KNOW, IT'S WORK OF JOURNALISM. IT WASN'T LIKE AN AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
Jon: SURE.
BUT I WANTED THEM TO READ IT AND KNOW WHAT WAS COMING OUT, AND I WANTED TO HEAR THEIR THOUGHT, SO YEAH, THEY ENDORSED THE PROJECT.
Jon: OH, THEY DID. SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY READ IT AND WENT LIKE, I WILL NEVER SPEAK WITH YOU AGAIN. [LAUGHTER].
NO. THEY READ IT AND, THEY READ IT AND EACH OF THEM HAD SOME CONCERN ABOUT SOME FAMILY MEMBER WHERE THEY HAD TOLD ME SOMETHING REVEALING ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER OR THEIR BOYFRIEND...
Jon: OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND THEN THEY WANTED TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE...
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THEY SAID ALL THIS STUFF I TOLD YOU ABOUT MYSELF, YEP, THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENED.
Jon: WOW. THAT'S TERRIFIC. DO YOU GUYS STILL GET TOGETHER?
YES. YES.
Jon: OH, THAT'S NICE.
AND MICHELLE FISHER HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.
Jon: MICHELLE FISHER HAS A CRUSH ON ME?
YEAH.  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: [SING SONGS]: AND I KNOW WHAT'S IN HER DIARY. [LAUGHTER] WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING AND SHARING THE STORY.
THANK YOU.
Jon: "SOLDIER GIRLS" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. HELEN THORPE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
