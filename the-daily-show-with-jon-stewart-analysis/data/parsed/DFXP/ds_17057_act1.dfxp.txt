FEBRUARY 14, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD E NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST, OH, SO APROPOS. RICKEY JER VASE. YOU KNOW WHY? VALENTINE'S DAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TREAT CUPID'S GOT FOR THE FAIRER SEX. OH, NO, DON'T! DON'T. YOU DESERVE THIS. LADIES?
AMERICA'S WOMEN IN UNIFORM MAY SOON HAVE NEW RULES ON THE BATTLEFIELD. THE PENTAGON TODAY CHANGED ITS RULES TO GIVE WOMEN JOBS IN MORE FORWARD POSITIONS, CLOSER TO THE  FRONT LINES.
Jon: DO YOU LIKE IT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT, LADIES, FRONT LINE COMBAT ROLES, TRY IT ON! THE HELMET'S SUPPOSED TO BE SNUG. ALL US GUYS THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY SWELL IDEA. YOU'VE EARNED IT. WELL, ALMOST ALL US GUYS.
I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WOMEN IN FRONT-LINE COMBAT.
Jon: OH, WHAT A SURPRISE. PRINCE VON STICK UP HIS ASS. (LAUGHTER) SORRY, THAT WAS NOT FAIR. THAT WAS CRASS. I APOLOGIZE. THE MAN'S A FORMER SENATOR, HAS EXPERIENCE HANDLING MILITARY ISSUES. LET'S GO RIGHT TO THE PENTAGON AND ASK. WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
I'VE SEEN WOMEN IN COMBAT PERFORM AN EXPANDED ROLE AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM. THEY'RE BRAVE WOMEN ALONG WITH THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS AND A LOT TO BE SAID FOR THEIR  CONTRIBUTION AND EXPERIENCES OVER THE LAST DECADE OF WAR. AND I'M... I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
Jon: WELL, THAT ALL SOUNDS VERY THOROUGH. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHAT DO YOU REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE MILITARY, GENERAL PATTON? (LAUGHTER) HELP ME OUT, SANTORUM.
YOU HAVE MEN AND WILL TOGETHER IN COMBAT, I THINK THERE'S... MEN HAVE EMOTIONS  WHEN YOU SEE A WOMAN IN HARM'S WAY. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NATURAL, THAT'S VERY MUCH IN OUR  CULTURE TO BE PROTECTIVE. THE ISSUE IS HOW MEN WOULD REACT TO SEEING WOMEN IN HARM'S WAY OR  POTENTIALLY BEING INJURED OR IN A VULNERABLE POSITION AND NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING  THE MISSION.
Jon: THAT'S IT. IT'S NOT THE WOMEN! SANTORUM IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE MEN. (LAUGHTER) AND HOW CONCERNED THEY'LL BE ABOUT THE WOMEN! LIKE THE RAID ON BIN LADEN'S SAFE HOUSE. TEAM OF MEN. LAND A CHOPPER IN THE COMPOUND. THEY BREAK IN THE DOOR. THEY CHARGE UP THE STAIRS. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. BUT IMAGINE A WOMAN WAS THERE. THEY LAND IN THE COMPOUND. THEY HEAD OFF TO THE SAFE HOUSE. THERE'S A PUDDLE. OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THERE YOU GO. THEN WHEN THEY BREAK DOWN THE DOOR THEY GO "LADIES FIRST." SHE WALKS BY, THE SCENT OF HER  PERFUME, HE'S ATTRACTED. OH, MISSION UNACCOMPLISHED! IT'S UNAVOIDABLE! LET'S FACE IT. WAR IS EASIER WHEN IT'S ALL DUDES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER. IT'S LIKE THE MARINE CORPS MOTTO SAYS: LEAVE AS MANY MEN BEHIND AS YOU WANT. NO BIG DEAL. WE'RE ALL DUDES. RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR FUN WITH MR. SANTORUM AND HIS SOMEWHAT  ANTIQUATED VIEWS ON THE ROLES OF WOMEN BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT SOME CLEANED-OUT COBWEBS AND  DUST OFF OF SOMEONE'S VIEWS ON GENDER, MEET FOX'S LIZ TROTTA  AND HEAR WHY SHE THINKS IT'S A BAD IDEA FOR WOMEN TO SERVE AMONGST MEN IN OUR MILITARY. I WANT TO WARN THE MEN IN OUR AUDIENCE, IF THERE ARE WOMEN IN THE ROOM WHERE YOU'RE WATCHING  THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO PROTECT THEM. (LAUGHTER)
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO THE DEFENSE SECRETARY LEON PANETTA COMMENTED ON A NEW PENTAGON  REPORT ON SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE MILITARY. AND THE REPORT SAYS THAT THERE'S BEEN... SINCE 2006 A 64% INCREASE IN VIOLENT SEXUAL ASSAULTS. NOW, WHAT DID THEY EXPECT? THESE PEOPLE ARE IN CLOSE CONTACT. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: YOU KNOW THE ORIGINAL BAILIFF FROM "NIGHT COURT" IS RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIMPLE MATH! IT'S SIMPLE MATH! IF YOU WANT TO MIX THE SEXES, YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 64% UPTICK IN VIOLENT SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT WILL OCCUR. YOU KNOW OLD SAYING, YOU CAN'T MAKE A COED OMELET WITHOUT RAPING A FEW EGGS. (LAUGHTER) WHY DID THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES EVER ABANDON THAT SLOGAN, ANYWAY? (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, THE ONLY WAY THIS WOMAN COULD MAKE HER STATEMENT WORSE  IS TO SOMEHOW SUGGEST THAT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY IS  ACTUALLY A FEMINIST BOONDOGGLE. SPOILER ALERT: SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT WORSE.
IT'S STRICTLY BEEN A QUESTION OF PRESSURE FROM THE FEMINISTS. AND THE FEMINISTS HAVE ALSO DIRECTED THEM, REALLY, TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY. THEY HAVE SEXUAL COUNSELORS ALL OVER THE PLACE. VICTIMS' ADVOCATES. SEXUAL RESPONSE COORDINATORS. SO YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE BUREAUCRACY UPON BUREAUCRACY BEING BUILT UP WITH ALL KIND OF  LEVELS OF PEOPLE TO SUPPORT WOMEN IN THE MILITARY WHO WERE NOW BEING RAPED TOO MUCH. (AUDIENCE REACTS) (BOOS)
Jon: ARE YOU NOT HORROR-TAINED? RAPED TOO MUCH. (LAUGHTER) THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT WE'VE GOT TO SPEND TO HELP WOMEN  WHO ARE RAPED TOO MUCH. (LAUGHTER) THINK OF HOW MUCH CHEAPER IT WOULD BE FOR ALL OF US IF THEY WERE RAPED JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING WHAT THIS PULLING ON  HER EAR WAS ALL ABOUT, SHE'S NOT HAVING TROUBLE WITH HER EAR PIECE, THAT IS HER BRAIN TRYING  TO ESCAPE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK, LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO ME I'M JUST GOING  TO (BLEEP)ING LEAVE. (LAUGHTER) I'M GOING TO CRAWL OUT OF YOUR SKULL AND LET YOU JUST TALK  WHATEVER (BLEEP) YOU WANT TO TALK. FOR MORE ON THIS STORY, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR ARMED FORCES CORRESPONDENT SPAN THAT BEE. SAM, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M CONFUSED. THE WHOLE THING HAS ME VERY CONFUSED. RICK SANTORUM SAYS WOMEN CAN'T BE IN COMBAT BECAUSE THEY'LL  TRIGGER MEN'S CHIVALROUS NATURE. RIZ TROTTA SAYS FEMALE SOLDIERS CAN'T SERVE BECAUSE THEY'LL  AROUSE MEN'S BASER INSTINCTS. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
WELL, JON, I KNOW YOU'RE EXPECTING AN APOLOGY AND, BELIEVE ME, YOU'LL GET IT.
Jon: FROM... FROM YOU? AN APOLOGY FOR WHAT, SAM?
JON, FOR THIS. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU GUYS CAN RAPE IT OR YOU CAN PROTECT IT BUT YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S WHO YOU ARE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THINGS LIKE  THAT LIKE IT'S A BAD HABIT THAT MEN HAVE. LIKE, OH, MEN ALWAYS LEAVE THEIR SOCKS ON THE FLOOR. MEN CAN'T PUT THE TOILET SEAT DOWN.
GOD, I KNOW! DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN GUYS DO THAT? AND WHEN THEY RAPE? (LAUGHS) LADIES, AM I RIGHT? WHAT'S UP? (LAUGHS) OH, MY GOSH! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO FEMALE SOLDIERS SHOULD JUST EXPECT TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED?
WELL, FEMALE SOLDIERS, GAL REPORTERS, LADY DOCTORS, TEACHERETTES, AVIATRIXES, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS WHEN YOU'RE A  WOMAN INTRUDING IN A MAN'S WORLD. WE EXPECT TO BE PAID SLIGHTLY LESS AND RAPED SLIGHTLY MORE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU KNOW, I'M A... AS A MAN, I'M OFFENDED. MEN ARE ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE OF WORKING IN CLOSE QUARTERS WITH WOMEN IN AN APPROPRIATE, RESPECTFUL MANNER.
UM, JON? I'M UP HERE.
Jon: I'M LOOKING UP THERE!
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S MY FAULT. YOU DON'T BRING THE FRUIT IF YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GET PICKED. WOW.
Jon: YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY MAN IS IN A CONSTANT BATTLE TO SUPPRESS URGES TO PICK FRUIT  THAT DOES NOT WANT TO BE PICKED BY THEM.
OH! SO SOMEONE HATES WOMEN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DON'T HATE WOMEN. I DON'T...
OKAY, JUST LIKE FEMINISTS HATE MEN BY ASSUMING THAT THEY COULD BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN  PREHISTORIC RAPE MACHINES. WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, IS THE NAME OF MY ALL-GIRL PUNK BAND. WE'RE GONNA BE AT THE ROXY THIS WEEKEND AND, FELLAS, AS ALWAYS, LADIES DRINK FREE IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT. TWO FOR ONE ROOFIE-TINIS. COME ON DOWN, PROTECT US; RAPE
