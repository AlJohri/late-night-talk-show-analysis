FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE THE  "DAILY SHOW."  HIGH NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. OUR GUEST, PAYING WILL BE  JOINING US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). SHE'S, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY HE IS  THE HOST OF THE POPULAR SHOW  "ELLEN."  ( LAUGHTER ) LET'S GET TO OUR TOP STORY  TONIGHT AS THOUGH WE WERE A NEWS  ORGANIZATION. ( LAUGHTER )  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN  CRISIS MODE. HURRICANE SANDY STILL SWIRLING. THE I.R.S., THE AP, THE BENGHAZI  E-MAILS, JOE BIDEN'S SPRING  BREAK. OH! IT'S TIME FOR-- THAT'S NOT EVEN  PHOTOSHOPPED  ( LAUGHTER )  IT IS TIME FOR SOME DAMAGE CONTROL, WHICH IS WHY YESTERDAY  THE ADMINISTRATION SENT OUT  WHOEVER THIS GUY IS. ( LAUGHTER )  TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE  I.R.S. WAS UP TO.
NORSHOULD WE. AS I SAID, THERE IS-- THE I.R.S. IS AN AGENCY THAT HAS A-- HAS A  HISTORICAL INDEPENDENCE. FOR VERY GOOD REASONS IN THIS  TOWN, WE-- THE-- THE WHITE HOUSE  AND STAYS AS FAR AWAY FROM THE I.R.S. AND LETS THEM DO THEIR  BUSINESS. THE CARDINAL RULE IS YOU DON'T  GET INVOLVED IN AN INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATION.
Jon:  YOU SWEET, SWEET  BOY. ( LAUGHTER )  I KNOW THE CARDINAL RULE IS YOU  DON'T GET INVOLVED, BUT THE  PROBLEM HERE IS THE GAP BETWEEN INVOLVED IN AND AWARE OF. IT'S LIKE YOUR KIDS WANT TO MAKE  DINNER FOR YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE INVOLVED. BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT  THEY'RE DOING IT. ( LAUGHTER )  OR YOU GET STUCK EXPLAINING WHY  YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN. AND--  ( LAUGHTER )  CAN I SAY SOMETHING. MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT, THE  KIDS, EVEN WHEN THE HOUSE IS ON  FIRE. THEY DON'T LOSE THEIR SMILE. "OH, THERE'S A FIRE..."  BY THE WAY, WE WEREN'T THE ONLY  ONES WHO WONDERED WHY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SENT OUT KEVIN A  OLDER BROTHER FROM "HOME ALONE."
I MEAN, THIS IS NO DISRESPECT  TO YOU. WHY ARE YOU HERE TODAY? WHY ISN'T THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF  OF STAFF HERE TO TELL US WHAT  HAPPENED?
DISPL WHY AM I HERE INSTEAD  OF THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF  STAFF?  I DON'T KNOW. HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE  FUNNIER?  I DON'T KNOW. YOUNG GUY WHO REALLY DOESN'T  KNOW ANSWERING QUESTIONS. NOT THAT HAVING ACTUAL  EXPLANATIONS FOR THE SCANDAL  WOULD HAVE EVEN MATTERED.
THIS IS JUST ROTTEN TO THE  CORE. THIS IS ARROGANCE. THIS IS BIG GOVERNMENT CRONYISM.
NANNY STATE IS HERE TO TELL  US ALL WHAT TO DO, AND IF WE  START CRITICIZING, YOU GET  TARGETED.
ALL THREE OF THESE SCANDALS  MAKES A CLUSTER THAT IMPLIES  SOME VERY BAD THINGS.
LITERALLY, THE DECISIONS OF  OUR LIFE AND DEATH MAY VERY WELL  BE IN THE HANDS OF THE I.R.S.
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHAT  THE FACTS ARE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YOU MISSED LAST  BIT. PLAY THE LAST BIT AGAIN. JUST GIVE THEM THE LAST BIT  AGAIN. THEY MISSED THE LAST THING  BECAUSE THEY WERE LAUGHING AT  MICHELLE BACHMAN BECAUSE SHE'S ( BLEEP ) INSANE.
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW WHAT  THE FACTS ARE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:-- HERE'S WHAT I  KNOW-- I I SAID, LIFE AND DEATH. ARROGANT CLUSTER... LIFE OR  DEATH. THE FACTS ARE ( BLEEP ). UN. ( LAUGHTER. UN YES, THE ADMINISTRATION'S  LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS EQUAL  ONLY TO THE REPUBLICANS', AS OF NOW, FACT-FREE, BONE-DEEP  CERTAINTY AND CONTEMPT. AND THIS, MY FRIEND.
ABC NEWS TRUMPETED AN  EXCLUSIVE STORY THAT PURPORTED  TO REVEAL E-MAILS PROVING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD MEDDLED WITH  THE BEG TALKING POINTS LAST  SEPTEMBER.
PART OF HIS STORY TURNED OUT  TO HAVE BEEN BASED ON AN  INACCURATE SUMMARY OF E-MAILS THAT MADE THINGS LOOK WORSE FOR  THE WHITE HOUSE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  CAN ANYBODY DO  THEIR JOBS IN THAT TOWN. ?O NOW EVEN THE PRESIDENT IS  MESSING UP. WE FOUND AN E-MAIL WHERE THE  STATE DEPARTMENT SAID THEY  WANTED TO EDIT IT TO REFLECT POLITICAL CONCERNS. OH, LOOK, IT'S A GROUPON. I'M SORRY. IT'S BECOMING VERY CLEAR THAT  NOBODY REALLY KNOWS ENOUGH ABOUT  THESE THREE SCANDAL/ISSUES TO MAKE ANY DEFINITIVE JUDGMENT ON  THEM YET. BUT IF IT'S A SCANDAL YOU WANT,  IT'S THE SCANDAL WE HAVE. IN OUR RECURRING SERIES ABOUT  RETURNING IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN  VETERANS AND THE PAPERWORK QUAGMIRE THAT AWAIT THEM THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MADE A  PROMISE IN APRIL OF 2009 THAT THEY WOULD CREATE A SEAMLESS  COMPUTERIZED VETERANS HEALTH  RECORD SYSTEM. COSTS BE DAMNED! CRITICS SAID IT COULDN'T BE  DONE. FOUR YEARS AND $1 BILLION LATER,  IT TURNS OUT, YEAH, THEY WERE  RIGHT, IT COULDN'T BE DONE. ( LAUGHTER )  AT LEAST NOT BY THE  ADMINISTRATION. IN FACT, IT SO COULDN'T BE DONE  THERE'S STILL A BACKLOG OF  CLAIMS FOR 900,000 VETERANS AND PAPER DISABILITY RECORDS STILL  UNDIGITIZED AND PILED UP SO HIGH  THE FLOOR OF ONE VA FIELD OFFICE IS GOING TO COLLAPSE. ( LAUGHTER )  PERHAPS INJURING PEOPLE WHO,  LUCKILY, WOULD AT LEAST HAVE  INSTANT ACCESS TO THE PROPER FORMS THEY WOULD NEED TO FILE  THE CRUSHED PELVIS CLAIMS AND  MOST LIKELY HAVE THE TIME TO FILL THEM OUT BECAUSE OF HOW  LONG IT WILL TAKE TO DIG THEM  OUT OF THE RUBBLE. LAST MONTH, THE HOUSE  APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CALLED  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CHUCK CHUCK HAGEL. 7 HAGEL. YOU KNOW, IF HE MARRIED  KATHERINE HEIGL HE'D BE CHUCK  HAGEL HEIGL. SERIOUS. THEY CALLED CHUCK HAIG TOLL ASK  SINCE WE'RE NOT BUILDING A NEW  COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM, WHICH WILL THE TWO EXISTING SYSTEMS, ALTA  AND VISTA, FROM D.O.D. AND V.A. BE ABLE TO FULLY TALK TO EACH  OTHER.
WHAT THE CONGRESS INSTRUCTED,  WHAT THE CONGRESS FUNDED WAS A  SEAMLESS SYSTEM. WE'LL HAVE IT SHORTLY. CAN I TELL YOU IN A WEEK OR TWO  WE WILL HAVE SOMETHING DECIDED  WITHIN 30 DAYS, I'LL TELL THAT  YOU.
Jon:  30 DAYS! A HARD NUMBER. SINCE THAT INTERVIEW, 30 DAYS  AGO HE HAD OUR CHUCK HAGEL  ADVENT CALENDAR. I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE  THING. IT IS DAY 30. I'VE BEEN OPENING THE DOORS. LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT IN HERE  A LITTLE BIT OF NICE CHOCOLATE--  I'M EXPLAINING THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY RABBIS IN THE  AUDIENCE TONIGHT. YEAH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT  CHRISTIANS GIVE CHOCOLATE GIFTS AND ( BLEEP ) FOR, LIKE, 30 DAYS  STRAIGHT, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE  DEALING WITH, LIKE, THE  CRUCIFIXION. IT'S REALLY JUST-- IT'S ALL  ABOUT CANDY. WHEREAS JEWS, EVEN WHEN WE'RE  FREED WE'RE LIKE, "HAVE SOME  BITTER HERBS."  ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  SO IT'S-- FINALLY HERE. IT WAS 30 DAYS FIVE DAYS AGO, SO  DID THEY HAVE A DECISION ON THE  INTEROPERABILITY? WE ASKED THE HOUSE  APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND WE  CALLED THE PENTAGON. HERE'S A QUICK SUMMARY OF THOSE  THOSE CALLS WENT.
NO.
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOOOOOO!
Jon:  CHEWY. I GUESS RUNNING A BUREAUCRACY  WITH A SINGLE GOAL IS JUST TOO  COMPLICATED.
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN TWICE NOW  HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST  EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN OPERATIONS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon:  OH, YEAH, THAT'S  RIGHT. THEY DID RUN A VERY EFFECTIVE  CAMPAIGN OPERATION. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN  ONLINE COMPONENT HERE, TAKING  TWO DISPARATE DATABASES AND TURNING THEM INTO ONE GIGANTIC  DEBUT. A BILLION DOLLARS SAYS THAT'S  IMPOSSIBLE.
AT OBAMA HEADQUARTERS WHAT  THEY DID FINALLY WAS UNITE THE  DATABASES THEY'D HAD FROM THE FIRST CAMPAIGN, THE FUND-RAISING  DATABASE, THE POLLING DATABASE,  ALL INTO ONE GIGANTIC DATABASE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  SURE. YOU CAN DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE  PAYING PEOPLE WITH PIZZA. THEY CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING. ( LAUGHTER )  THESE PAPER ROARS AT THE V.A. ARE ALREADY COMPLETELY  FRAGMENTED. YOU WOULD NEED AN INCREDIBLY  SOPHISTICATE DATA MINING  OPERATIONS TO IDENTIFY THE VETERANS LET ALONE TARGET THEM--  ROLE ROLL THE CLIP.
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN IS WIDELY  BELIEVE BELIEVE TO HAVE THE MOST  SOPHISTICATING MINING OPERATION.
THEY CREATED A HOLISTIC  SYSTEM WHERE THEY COULD NOT JUST  TARGET PEOPLE BUT FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO TARGET PEOPLE.
THEY COMPILED INFORMATION ON  YOUR BUYING HABITS LIKE WHAT  MAGAZINE YOU SUBSCRIBED TO, MAYBE INFORMATION ON WHERE AND  HOW YOU LIKE TO TRAVEL.
Jon:  THAT'S NOT CREEPY  AT ALL. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT? THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE  TRYING TO GIVE MONEY TO  VETERANS, GET MONEY FROM. VOTERS AND SUPPORTERS, AND  ALTHOUGH THESE VETERANS ARE  ACTIVELY TRYING TO GIVE YOU THEIR INFORMATION. HAVE SOME GIVEN UP, GO TO TO  DOOR. YOU THINK HE WOULD DO THAT?
THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS AND  AIDE STAFFERS HAVE BEEN WORKING  NONSTOP, KNOCKING ON DOORS, MAKING PHONE CALLS AND GETTING  PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY.
Jon:  MOTHER ( BLEEP )! YOU COULD CLEAR UP THIS V.A. THING IN A MONTH! CLEARLY, THE LESSON APPEARS TO  BE, IF WE COULD TAKE THE SAME  URGENCY, ENTHUSIASM, AND CLARITY OF VISION YOU NEED TO GET  ELECTED TO GOVERNMENT AND APPLY  THOSE TWO DPORCHING. CAN WE FIX SOME PROBLEMS? WHY, WE MOTHER ( BLEEP ) CAN. WE'LL B
