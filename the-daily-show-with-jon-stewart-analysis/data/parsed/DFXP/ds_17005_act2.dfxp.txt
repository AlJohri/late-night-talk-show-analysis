(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. HOLD ON. DO YOU WANT TO SEE DARTH VADER IN A BRA AND PANTIES? HOLD ON. WELCOME BACK. ALSO WHEN WE WERE LAST ON THE AIR, THE PROTEST KNOWN AS OCCUPY WALL STREET WERE IN THEIR INFANCY. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW THEY'RE DOING NOW.
WALL STREET PROTEST STARTED HERE IN NEW YORK LAST MONTH HAVE NOW SPREAD TO MORE THAN  60 OTHER CITIES.
THE PROTESTS HAVE STRETCHED FROM NEW YORK AND BOSTON TO SEATTLE, LOS ANGELES.
Jon: NEW YORK, BOSTON (BREATHLESS) THEY'RE LIKE THE HARD ROCK CAFE OF LEFTIST MOVEMENTS. HEY, EVERYBODY. TRY THE EMMA GOLDMAN BURGER. IT'S A REVOLUTION. THAT'S NOT THE ONLY GOOD NEWS.
THE MOVEMENT'S WEBSITE HAS COLLECTED NEARLY $300,000 IN DONATIONS.
Jon: YOU HAVE $300,000? ALL RIGHT. YOU BETTER CHANGE THE TITLE OF THE PROTEST. THERE YOU GO. I'M KIDDING. I'M SURE THE MONEY IS, YOU KNOW, IS IN NO WAY GOING TO GO TO THEIR HEAD. THEY GOT A BUTLER. SON OF A BITCH. SIR, YOUR HASH, SIR. PERHAPS THE BEST SIGN OF THE MOVEMENT... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  PERHAPS THE BEST SIGN OF THE  MOVEMENT'S GROWING POPULARITY HAS TO BE THIS.
LAST WEEK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN FLORIDA, ROMNEY SAID THIS ABOUT THE OCCUPY WALL  STREET MOVEMENT. QUOTE, I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS. THIS CLASS WARFARE. BUT MONDAY ROMNEY SOUNDED MUCH DIFFERENT WHEN MEETING WITH VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE TOP 1%. I WORRY ABOUT THE 99% IN AMERICA. SO I LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON WALL STREET AND MY OWN VIEW IS, BOY, I UNDERSTAND HOW  THOSE PEOPLE FEEL.
Jon: LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT. FIRST OF ALL, I LOOK AT THEM AND I SAY, OH, BOY, YOU KNOW, UMM: I LOOK AT THE 99% AND I SAY, GEE, WOW. THERE SEEMS TO BE A (BEEP) THESE PEOPLE. HONEY, GET THE GATE. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU'VE MADE IT. WHEN MITT ROMNEY HAS TAKEN BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT ABOUT YOU. OF COURSE IT HASN'T BEEN ALL GOOD NEWS FOR THE MOVEMENT FOR ALL THEIR POPULARITY FOR ALL  THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THOUGHTFUL CRITIQUES OF OUR POWER STRUCTURE. THERE'S ALSO THIS. A GUY TAKING A (BEEP). YOU KNOW WHAT? THE GUY (BEEP) ON POLICE CAR. MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE. NO! NO, BAD. NO! NAUGHTY! NAUGHTY! ( APPLAUSE ) HERE'S THE PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY PROTESTS ARE OFTEN AS MUCH ABOUT OPTICS AS THEY ARE ABOUT SUBSTANCE. YOU DO NOT WANT THIS TO BE YOUR TIANAMEN SQUARE. YOU HAVE TAPPED INTO A REAL INJUSTICE THAT PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. NOTHING CAN DERAIL YOUR MOVEMENT FAST EVERY THAN SOMEONE WHO IS UNABLE TO DERAIL THEIR MOVEMENTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
