Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED JIM HENSON, THE BIOGRAPHY, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM BRIAN JAY JONES.
THANK YOU.
THANKS, GREAT TO BE HERE.
YOU KNOW, JIM HENSON, THE BIOGRAPHY, HERE WAS FOR ME I THINK ALMOST THE MOST STUNNING PART. IT'S BEEN OVER 20 YEARS.
YEAH.
SINCE JIM HENSON'S DEATH.
YEAH, AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT STILL SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY. THAT MATH I THINK REALLY STUNS PEOPLE SOMETIMES.
IT'S INCREDIBLE. AND I STILL REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY PASS AWAY YOU THINK OH, THAT WAS A GOOD MAN, THAT'S A SHAME. BUT BOY, HE LEFT A BIG HOLE.
MAN.
YEAH.
IN EVERYBODY'S HEART. I MEAN IT WAS REALLY VERY SPECIAL GUY.
YEAH. I MEAN THERE IS A REASON THAT EVERYONE STILL KNOWS AND LOVES THE MUPPETS AND THAT DISNEY IS REBOOTING THEM AND TRYING TO GET THEM BACK IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS. IT'S A HUGE LEGACY, THAT HE DID AND ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN A VERY SHORT TIME.
AND WHAT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SUCH MEMORIES OF IT. AND YET AS YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOK YOU GO OH, RIGHT, THE ORIGINAL SHOW WAS HOSTED BY A PUPPET NAMED NIGEL.
RIGHT. AND HE CALLED IT SEX AND VIOLENCE. >>I REMEMBER THINKING THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT AT ALL. THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK.
THAT DIDN'T REALLY WORK.
IT TOOK HIM, THAT WAS A REAL STUDY IN STICK TO ITIVENESS FOR HIM. THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD PUT OUT A PILOT, HAVE IT FAIL, AND ANOTHER AND IT DOESN'T TAKE HOLD AND DOES IT AGAIN AND IT FINALLY CATCHES ON.
AND THE STRANGE THING IS HOW IT CATCHES ON. YOU KNOW, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" WHICH IS THIS INCREDIBLE COUNTERCULTURE AND EXPLOSIVE, SATIRICAL NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS, I MEAN REALLY CREATED A WHOLE DIFFERENT GENRE OF TELEVISION AND THEN HERE IS THIS GUY WITH HIS PUPPETS.
YEAH, HE'S ON THERE. AND JOHN BELUSHI CALLED THEM THE MUCKING FUPPETS THEY HATED SHARING AIR TIME WITH THEM AND IT WAS SORT OF A BAD DNA BETWEEN THE MUPPETS AND SNL MENTALITY. IT TURNED OUT OKAY. THE MUPPET SHOW CAME ALONG THE FIRST SEASON AND THEY COULD WAVE GOOD-BYE NICELY. BUT THE TEAM DID SEND A POSTCARD BACK FROM LONDON AND SAY WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE MUCKING FUPPETS, HERE WE ARE, BIGGEST SHOW IN THE WORLD. AND JIM HENSON HAD THE SOUL, THIS GUY HAD ARTIST SOUL AND INVENTOR SOUL AND REALLY A BIT OF A RENAISSANCE MAN.
YEAH. AND DID IT ALL IT WAS SORT OF CREATIVELY RESTLESS. THROUGHOUT THE '60s HE WANTED TO DO AN INFLATABLE NIGHTCLUB AND DROP IT IN AN ALLEY IN NEW YORK CITY AND BRING DOWN WOMEN IN WHITE LEOTARDS AND PROJECT MOVIES ON THEM AND PLAY MUSIC.
EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE WAS GOING, WHERE IS THIS PLACE. I WILL GO THERE.
AND THE TECHNOLOGY WASN'T THERE FOR HIM YET. HE WAS A LITTLE TOO FAR AHEAD OF THE CURVE A LOT OF THE TIME. HE IS DOING SORT OF HIPPIE DOCUMENTARIES AND HE'S DOING SORT OF TWILIGHT ZONIE SHORT SPECIALS FOR NBC. AND FINALLY THE EXCLAMATION POINT AT THE END OF THE '60s IS WE KNOW "SESAME STREET" COMES ALONG. BUT EVEN HE SAYS IN THE 60S, YOU KNOW I HAD TWO CAREERS GOING, I WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL FILMMAKER AND THEN I HAD THE MUPPETS. THE MUPPETS FINALLY TOOK HOLD.
BUT THE FUSION OF THE TWO IS ALMOST WHY IT WORKED. BECAUSE WHEN YOU WATCH THE MUPPETS, THERE WAS-- IT DIDN'T HAVE THE CONDESCENSION OR THE SORT OF STRANGE ADOLESCENT NATURE OF MAY BE SOME OF THE OTHER PUPPET THINGS. IT WAS INFUSED WITH A VERY SOPHISTICATED AND SUBVERSIVE SENSE.
NOT TOO TIRED AN NOT TOO SWEET. THAT SWEET SPOT BETWEEN LOONEY TUNES AND DISNEY, AND YOU KNOW, THE MUPPETS ARE FUN AND THEY'RE FAMILY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE REALLY ENDED UP LOVING THEM. THE RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE, THE MUPPET SHOW WITH KERMIT IS KIND OF THE EYE OF THE HURRICANE, THAT WAS THE WAY IT WAS WITH JIM. HE WAS THE EYE OF THAT  HURRICANE THE GLUE THAT HELD THEM ALL TOGETHER. IT WAS CRAZY, HE WAS INSTIGATING SOMETIMES BUT BROUGHT THEM ALL BACK TOGETHER AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT MADE THEM ALL WORK, JIM LOVED TO WORK. IT WAS ALWAYS FUN AND THAT SHOWS UP.
AND HE WAS THE IRON MAN. THAT IS WHY I THINK HIS DEATH WAS SO STUNNING, A, THAT IT WAS SO ABRUPT AND SUDDEN AND HE HAD BEEN SO HEALTHY. AND I STILL REMEMBER, BOY, IF YOU WANT A GOOD CRYFEST GO ON YOUTUBE AND FIND HENSON FUNERAL BECAUSE THIS IS, PEOPLE ARE IN SHOCK. AND THERE'S THE PUPPETS. I MEAN IT IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES YOU CAN REALLY BRING A PUPPET TO A FUNERAL.
RIGHT.
AND IN HIS ABSENCE IS  NOTABLE IN THERE YOU I MEAN YOU ARE REALLY MISSING HIM WHEN YOU SEE THAT IT IS HEARTBREAKING.
IT IS HEARTBREAKING. AND IT IS, I ALWAYS USED TO THINK I WILL GO TO THE DOCTOR, LIKE THREE DAYS EARLIER THAT IS NOT REALLY THE CASE.
IT WAS SO SEVERE, BY THE TIME THE SYMPTOMS WERE SHOWING SOME SAID IT WAS SO STRONG BY THE TIME SYMPTOMS SHOWED UP IT WAS PROBABLY TOO LATE ANYWAY. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS, MOST GUYS WOULD SAY RIDE IT OUT. I'LL BE FINE.
I'M THAT WAY, IF I GET SICK, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. I WILL SLEEP THERE.
EXACTLY.
WELL, I'M REALLY GLAD, YOU KNOW, IT STRIKES ME THE FIRST TIME ANYBODY HAS REALLY CATALOGED HIS LIFE AND PUT IT OUT THERE AND IT IS A WONDERFUL MEMOIR.
THANK YOU.
A WONDERFUL MEMORY FOR HIM. CALLED JIM HENSON THE BIOGRAPHY, ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. BRIAN JAY JONES. THANK YOU, SIR. (APPLAUSE)
