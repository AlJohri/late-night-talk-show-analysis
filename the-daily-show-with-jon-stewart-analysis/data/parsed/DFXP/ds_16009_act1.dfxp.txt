JANUARY 17, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BIG SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT VERY EXCITING PETER BERGEN, THE INVENTOR OF BERGEN COUNTY NEW JERSEY. THE WHOLE THING WAS HIS IDEA. THE AUTHOR OF THE LONGEST WAR, A BOOK ABOUT THIS COUNTRY'S TIME IN AFGHANISTAN. SO THERE'S THAT. I WANT TO SAY LAST NIGHT I WATCHED THE GOLDEN GLOBES. I WAS OFFENDED BY RICKY GERVAIS. I WAS OFFENDED THAT A COMEDIAN COULD BE THAT FUNNY. AT AN AWARDS SHOW. RICKY WAS HILARIOUS. I HOPE YOU HAD A NICE WEEKEND. OTHERWISE I WATCHED A LITTLE BIT OF FOOTBALL AS WELL. I DO WANT TO SAY-- AND OBVIOUSLY IN OUR AMERICAN SPIRIT OF CIVILITY, IT'S BEEN  ABOUT A WEEK NOW. I DO WANT TO SAY IN THAT NEW SPIRIT TO THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS, SUCK IT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   AND BY "IT," I MEAN SOMETHING THAT BRINGS YOU COMFORT. LIKE (BEEP). ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. AMERICA IS GONE AS OF LAST WEDNESDAY WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA USHERED IN A NEW ERA.
ONLY A MORE CIVIL AND HONEST PUBLIC DISCOURSE CAN HELP US FACE UP TO THE  CHALLENGES OF OUR NATION.
Jon: CIVIL AND MORE HONOR DISCOURSE. WE'VE SEEN HIS PLEA FOR MORE CIVILITY PAY DIVIDENDS.
DEMOCRATS CALL RATHER THAN SIT APART DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS MINGLE IS  GATHERING SUPPORT.
A CALL FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SIT TOGETHER AT THE STATE OF THE UNION. I CALLED UP TOM AFTER HE DID THAT. HE GRACIOUSLY AGREED WE'RE GOING TO SIT TOGETHER.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE GOING TO SIT TOGETHER FOR TWO HOURS? HEY, HOW MANY OF US HAVE TO GET (BEEP) TO GO TO LUNCH? AND IN LIGHT OF CURRENT EVENTS TONIGHT I WILL NOT REFER TO THE CAUCUS ACROSS THE AISLE AS  DOUCHE BAG CENTRAL. LISTEN, IT'S A START. BY THE WAY THAT WAS A NICE CONGRESSIONAL... WHAT COULD GO WRONG WITH THAT? OH, NO! THAT'S EXACTLY. NO! CIVIL DISCOURSE MAKING HUGE STRIDES. HOW ABOUT HONOR DISCOURSE.
THE FIRST PIECE OF BUSINESS IS WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A NASTY BATTLE OVER HEALTH CARE. IN FACT THE REPUBLICAN BILL IS EVEN CALLED "REPEAL OF THE JOB- KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW."
Jon: TO BE FAIR, AFTER ALL THE TALK OF DEATH PANELS WE SHOULD THANKFUL THAT THE  REPUBLICANS DIDN'T DIDN'T GO WITH THE REPEAL OF THE GRANDMA KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW. THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PLACE FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO START THE CONVERSATION.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW REALLY TAKING ISSUE WITH THE JOB-KILLING PART OF THE TITLE.
Jon: DEMOCRATS. FOCUS IN ON SUBSTANCE.
THEY SAY IN LIGHT OF TUCSON, GET ANY KILLING OUT OF ANY TITLE ANYWHERE.
Jon: WHAT? NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. IF IT COSTS JOBS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO SAY IT COST JOBS. IF YOU DO THAT, YOU GET THIS.
THE NEW SPEAKER BOEHNER SAID YESTERDAY HE TALKED ABOUT LEGISLATION HE CALLED IT  JOB... WE'RE GOING TO STOP THIS JOB-DESTROYING LEGISLATION INSTEAD OF CALLING  IT JOB-KILLING LEGISLATION.
I'M GLAD THAT SPEAKER BOEHNER CHOSE TO VERBALIZE A DIFFERENT TITLE FOR THAT BILL. BUT THEY SO FAR HAVE REFUSED TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE TITLE OF JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE REPEAL.
Jon: AS A DEMOCRAT I INSIST YOU REFER TO HEALTH CARE REFORM NOT AS JOB-KILLING BUT  AS JOB-DESTROYING. BUT OF COURSE I'M A MODERATE DEMOCRAT. MY MORE LIBERAL COLLEAGUES INSIST THAT IT BE CALLED JOB- EVAPORATING. WHY DO YOU LET THEM DO THAT? THEY GOT TO CALL THE 2002 IRAQ WAR BILL A DIFFERENT NAME NOT THE TOTALLY AVOIDABLE WAR OF  CHOICE ENDLESS CLUSTER (BEEP) CREATION ACT. YOU BLEW YOUR SHOT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  OPPORTUNITY. WHATEVER. YOU BLEW IT. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY. DOES HEALTH CARE REFORM KILL, DESTROY, SLOWLY SOP UP JOBS? WELL ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE IT WILL CREATE A .5% DECREASE IN THE LABOR FORCE. DUE TO OLDER WORKERS BEING ABLE TO RETIRE EARLIER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT  THEIR HEALTH CARE AND OTHERS VOLUNTARILY LEAVING THEIR WORK FORCE OR REDUCING THEIR HOURS  SO IT IS JOB KILLING IN THE SENSE THAT GETTING MORE SLEEP AT NIGHT IS AWAKE KILLING. THE ACCURACY ARGUMENT COULD BENEFIT THE DEMOCRATS. THE SEMANTIC ARGUMENT CANNOT BENEFIT THE DEMOCRATS. FOX AND FRIENDS MAKE THAT POINTS EXPLICIT FOR US.
MR. WEANER LET'S START WITH YOU. YOU THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE TONE DEAF BY CALLING IT THE REPEALING THE JOB-KILLING  HEALTH CARE LAW ACT. WHY?
WELL IT'S NOT ONLY THE WRONG TONE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK  AT WHAT'S IN THE BILL IT'S JUST WRONG. THE BILL CREATES 300,000 NEW JOBS. THERE ARE 160 AMENDMENTS THAT DEMOCRATS PUT IN THE BILL THAT ARE MOSTLY TAX BREAKS FOR  SMALL BUSINESSES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE BILL CREATES THESE NEW SERVICES OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS....
MR. WEANER.
LIFETIME BENEFITS FOR SENIORS.
MR. WEANER WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BILL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NAME OF THE BILL.
Jon: HEY, MAN. WE DIDN'T BRING YOU ON HERE TO SPOUT FACTS. WE'RE HERE TO BITCH ABOUT WORDING. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. YOUR ROLE AS WHINY AGREED LIBERAL WE'LL TAKE IT TO THE GUEST....
LIBERALS DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE THAT THIS IS THE MOST DESTRUCT STIFF  PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO HIT OUR ECONOMY IN A LIFETIME.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE FINAL WORD.
LET'S FOCUS ON THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE BILL ALLOWS....
THE NAME.
THE PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. SENIORS....
THE NAME. THE PROBLEM WITH THE NAME.
Jon: WEINER, WHAT PART OF "WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO  UNDERSTAND" DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
