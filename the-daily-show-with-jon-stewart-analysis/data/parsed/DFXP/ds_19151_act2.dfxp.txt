Jon: WELCOME BACK! OBAMACARE. YOU KNOW, OBAMACARE. WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE SUFFERING THAT IT WOULD BRING. SO NOW THAT'S IT'S HERE, WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S SUFFERING. JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
FOR YEARS, TELEVISION PUNDITS HAVE BEEN DOING IMPORTANT WORK SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT OBAMACARE.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SIX TO TEN MONTHS FROM NOW IN A MASSIVE FISCAL CRISIS.
C'MON! YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
OBAMACARE LITERALLY MAY KILL YOU.
GOOD, KEEP GOING.
THE WORST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS NATION SINCE SLAVERY.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND NOW THAT THE LAW IS HERE AND IN EFFECT LET'S SEE WHAT THIS (BLEEP) STORM HAS BROUGHT.
EVERY DAY THE EXPERIENCE WITH OBAMACARE IS IMPROVING.
THE LAW WILL COST $5 BILLION LESS THAN PROJECTED.
WE HAVE THE LOWEST MONTHLY UNINSURED RATE THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD.
EVEN BETTER NEWS, PREMIUMS ARE LOWER THAN EXPECTED.
STOP! STOP! THAT'S NOT LIKE SLAVERY AT ALL. EVIDENTLY THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE PROBLEMS WITH OBAMACARE AND NOW ONLY 36% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT REPEAL. TO GET AMERICA TO FALL BACK IN HATE WITH THE LAW, I NEED HELP. I SAT DOWN WITH OBAMACARE CRITIC BETSY DEATH PANEL McCOY. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH ROAD FOR THE CRITICS OF THIS LAW. IF PEOPLE AREN'T BEHIND REPEALING THIS, HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THEM ON OUR SIDE?
I'M GOING TO JUST TURN THIS OFF FOR A SECOND.
BUT SHE WAS TOO UPSET TO TALK ABOUT IT -- I GUESS. SO IT WAS UP TO ME TO FIND A NEW DOOMS-DAY DIAGNOSIS TO STOP OBAMACARE NURSE JANET RUNBACK.
I LOST MY JOB AS A DIRECT RESULT OF OBAMACARE.
YES, OBAMACARE WILL MURDER YOUR JOB. THAT IS GOLD. NURSE'S JOB KILLED TO DEATH BY OBAMACARE. CAN YOU LOOK TO THAT CAMERA AND TELL ME JUST HOW HEART BROKEN YOU ARE.
I AM SO THRILLED TO HAVE LOST THAT JOB.
WAIT, YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT LOSING YOUR JOB?
I RAN A FREE CLINIC AND A JANITOR'S LUNCHROOM, OBAMACARE CAME ALONG AND MY PATIENTS WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME ABLE TO GET INSURANCE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS.
(BLEEP) IT. I CAN SPIN THIS. SICK PATIENTS TYRANICALLY REMOVED FROM A JANITOR'S LUNCHROOM, TRAGICALLY RECEIVING HEALTHCARE --
THERE IS NOTHING TRAGIC HERE. NOBODY IS CALLING ME TO ASK FOR FREE HEALTHCARE ANYMORE.
BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
BUT I SAID THAT IN A NEGATIVE WAY. YOU'RE SAYING IT IN A HAPPY WAY.
YES, I AM. IT WORKS!
MAYBE A VISIT TO THE FORMER CLINIC/JANITOR'S LUNCHROOM WOULD HELP THE TEARS FLOW. JOINED BY THE FORMER MEDICAL DIRECTOR DR. MARY, WE TOURED THE STATE-OF-THE-ART MEDICAL FACILITY EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE DIRTY CUPS AND RANDOM TRASH PATIENTS COULD EVER NEED.
THIS IS WHERE OUR OPTOMETRIST AND OPHTHALMOLOGISTS WOULD DO DIABETIC EYE CHECKS.
AND OBAMACARE HAS KICKED PEOPLE OUT OF THIS ROOM AND INTO FULLY STAFFED HOSPITALS.
YES. GETTING SOMEONE'S DIABETES UNDER CONTROL CAN PREVENT RENAL FAILURE AND DIALYSIS IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS. IT CAN PREVENT BLINDNESS, IT CAN PREVENT MASSIVE INFECTIONS WITH HOSPITALIZATIONS AND AMPUTATIONS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
HOW DOES THAT MATH WORK?
THOSE THINGS I JUST TALKED ABOUT, THE COMPLICATIONS COST A LOT MORE THAN A MONTH'S WORTH OF INSULIN AND A FEW BLOOD TESTS.
WHATEVER, LADY. I WAS AT LEAST GOING TO WALK OUT WITH A SAD GROUP HUG.
NO SAD HUGS. WE'RE HAPPY.
VERY SATISFIED.
GIVE YOURSELF A HUG.
I'M DOING THAT, THANK YOU.
I'D HAD ENOUGH OF THE UNINFORMED OPINIONS OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. TIME TO GO TO THE HORSE'S MOUTH. THE FORMER PATIENTS OF THE CLINIC WHO ARE NOW LIVING THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS OBAMACARE.
RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU THINK OBAMACARE WILL DESTROY AMERICA. OKAY. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. DON'T RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU THINK OBAMACARE WILL DESTROY AMERICA.
WITH OBAMACARE, I'VE GOT A GREAT DOCTOR AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN MY DIRECTION NOW.
MY EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT.
THEY WERE GIVING ME NOTHING. OBVIOUSLY BIASED BY THEIR PERSONAL POSITIVE EXPERIENCES. LITTLE CONSOLATION FOR JANET RUNBECK WHO REMAINS TRAGICALLY JOBLESS. SO, YOU'RE PROBABLY SPENDING YOUR DAYS DOING NOTHING NOW.
NO, ACTUALLY, I HAVE MOVED ON. NOW I CAN GO ELSEWHERE AND DO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED BY OTHER PEOPLE. I'M WORKING ON CAUSES SUCH AS HUMAN TRAFFICKING.
YOU MOVED ON TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING? OBAMACARE FORCES NURSE INTO SEX SLAVE TRADE. THAT IS GREAT! (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY RIGHT.
LUCKILY, TO BE AN OBAMACARE CRITIC... THIS IS US, THIS IS OBAMACARE. BEING RIGHT IS NOT A JOB REQUIREMENT.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
