CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, LARRY KING. HE IS THE LONG TIME HOST OF "LARRY KING, LIVE!."  [PRONOUNCED LIKE JON IS BEGGING HIM TO STAY ALIVE] SORRY, THAT'S "LARRY KING LIVE." I APOLOGIZE. ANYWAY, AS -- NO! OH, I FORGOT, LAST NIGHT ON THE SHOW, I HAD AN ACCIDENT. IF YOU WERE WATCHING LAST NIGHT'S SHOW, IN THE MIDST OF REALLY JUST A PASSIONATE, CLEVER  BIT, JOHNNY [BLEEPED] HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE EQUIPMENT. CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT REAL QUICK? [LAUGHTER] THAT'S NOT GOOD. [LAUGHTER] HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED. SO HERE'S, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. [AUDIENCE REACTS] THERE YOU GO. I WANT TO THANK MY DOCTOR OVER AT MT. SINAI FOR STITCHING ME UP, AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK  THE KID WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY WAITING FOR FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY, YOU KNOW  TO, LET ME JUMP THE LINE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I HAD A RESERVATION AT NOBU AT 8:30. SO IT WAS THE PERFECT COMEDY CUT. IT BLED ENOUGH THAT IT REALLY, YOU COULD SEE IT, BUT THAT I LOST MY ARM. [LAUGHTER] SO THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS I GOT HOME AND I WAS EXPLAINING TO MY SON, WHO IS SIX, GOING ON  SEVEN, WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HOW I SMASHED IT AND THE GLASS BROKE AND I CUT MY WRIST, AND HE GOES, "WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST USE YOUR OTHER HAND TO SHUT OFF THE BLENDER?"  [LAUGHTER] UH... YEAH. [APPLAUSE] YOU'RE GROUNDED. [LAUGHTER] HOW ABOUT THAT AS AN ANSWER? SO ANYWAY, I'M BACK. I'M READY FOR ACTION. I'M VERY EXCITED. YOU KNOW, IN ALL THE EXCITEMENT OVER A CERTAIN CONGRESSMAN'S EXCITEMENT, WE MAY MAY HAVE LOST  TRACK OF SOME OF THE OTHER PRESSING ISSUES OF THE DAY, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, THE ECONOMY. I WONDER HOW THAT'S GOING.
THE VERY DISAPPOINTING JOBS REPORT. EMPLOYERS ADDED JUST 54,000 WORKERS TO THEIR PAYROLLS IN MAY.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WENT UP TO 9.1%.
NEW FACTORY ORDERS FELL TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN TWO YEARS.
HOME PRICES AT THEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2002.
Jon: SEASHELLS ARE NOW CONSIDERED MONEY. [LAUGHTER] HOTCAKES SELLING LIKE CAKES THAT HAVED NOT BEEN HEATED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. HOLY CRAP. IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE THAT REALLY MAKE ME HAPPY THAT THERE IS A PRODUCT OUT THERE AS  DELICIOUS, NUTRITIOUS AND SUSPICIOUSLY AFFORDABLE AS JON STEWART'S SEMI-DIGESTABLE WONDER PASTE. [LAUGHTER] WOW. JON STEWART'S SEMI-DIGESTIBLE WONDER PASTE --  [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] MMHM. WOW. WOW. THAT WAS IN MY MOUTH. [LAUGHTER] EVERY JAR OF JON STEWART'S SEMI-DIGESTIBLE WONDER PASTE IS NOW GUARANTEED NOT TO CONTAIN  ANY PETS THAT YOU PERSONALLY KNEW. [LAUGHTER]
I GUARANTEE THERE'S NOT HAMSTERS, PAROTS, HORSES, CATS OR DOGS.
Jon: WOW. WHO'S GOING TO STITCH MY MOUTH UP? THAT WAS ONE DEPRESSING LITANY OF MISERABLE ECONOMIC NEWS. IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THAT PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WENT TO A CHRYSLER FACTORY, STRAPPED  ON THE GOGGLES AND OFFERED A CONGRATULATORY HANDSHAKE TO THE FEW REMAINING PEOPLE IN THE  COUNTRY WHO STILL HAVE JOBS. [LAUGHTER] THERE HE DELIVERED HIS STATE OF THE ECONOMY ADDRESS.
WE STILL FACE SOME TOUGH TIMES. WE STILL FACE SOME CHALLENGES. WE'RE GOING TO PASS THROUGH SOME ROUGH TERRAIN. THERE'S STILL SOME HEADWINDS THAT ARE COMING AT US.
Jon: NO [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE ROUGH TERRAIN, A LITTLE HEADWINDS STILL COMING AT US IS FINE. WE'RE AMERICANS. WE'RE STRONG.
JUST LIKE IF YOU HAD A BAD ILLNESS, IF YOU GOT HIT BY A  TRUCK, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FOR YOU TO MEND, AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR ECONOMY. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW DID WE GO FROM THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF HEADWINDS TO WE GOT HIT BY A TRUCK? NOT EVEN A CAR. WE GOT HIT BY A TRUCK. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO GET HIT BY TRUCKS, THEY DON'T BOUNCE BACK. THEY DON'T USUALLY LIVE. AND THE ONES WHO DO LIVE, WINDING UP WRITING ABOUT IT WITH THEIR FEET. ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECTS OF THE FAILING ECONOMY IS THAT IT'S NOT FAILING EQUALLY.
IT HAS HIT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY MORE THAN MOST GROUPS.
Jon: I KNEW IT, AFRICAN AMERICANS. WESLEY SNIPES WAS RIGHT, ALWAYS BET ON BLACK AND DON'T PAY YOUR TAXES. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. WELL, HE WAS HALF RIGHT. FOR MORE ON THE RECESSION'S EFFECT ON AFRICAN AMERICAN, WE GO TO OUR SENIOR BLACK  CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LARRY, 96% OF BLACKS WHO COULD VOTE VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA. 96%. NOW THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BEING LEFT OUT IN THE COLD ECONOMICALLY.
HE COULD LOSE THE BLACK VOTE.
Jon: YES, LOSE IT. REALLY?
OH, YEAH, JON. IF HE CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THIS ECONOMY, THEN GOOD BUY 96%, HELLO 94%. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO ECONOMY BE DAMNED. BLACK COMMUNITY IS STILL SUPPORTING THIS GUY.
LET ME CLEAR SOMETHING UP, JON, I VOTED FOR OBAMA BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK. IS HE STILL BLACK? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK HE'S STILL BLACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER WHAT, THE BLACK COMMUNITY WOULD STAY LOYAL TO A BLACK PRESIDENT?
WELL, NOT JUST A BLACK PRESIDENT, JON, A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.
Jon: WHAT? WHY?
LOYALTY. WE DANCE WITH WHO BROUGHT US. LOOK, THE REPUBLICANS FREED THE SLAVES, WE VOTED FOR THEM FOR 100 YEARS. THEN THE DEMOCRATS PASSED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, SO THAT'S BEEN GOOD FOR DAMN NEAR FIDDY.
Jon: HOW DO THEY ENFORCE THIS UNIFORMITY, THIS BLOC?
MOSTLY PEER PRESSURE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOW IS PEER PRESSURE... IT'S A SECRET BALLOT?
NOT IN BLACK PRECINCTS IT'S NOT, JON. OH, NO. SEE, JON, WHITE PEOPLE VOTE LIKE THIS. BUT BROTHERS, MAN, BROTHERS BE TALKING AT THE BALLOT BOX, "YOU BETTER BE VOTING FOR THE BLACK  PRESIDENT, NEGRO. DON'T MAKE ME COME IN THERE."
Jon: LARRY, PLEASE.
THEY'RE HAVING A DEF JAM REUNION. I WAS WORKING OUT SOME STUFF.
Jon: ARE THERE STILL CONCERNS FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY AS UNIFYING AS SLAVERY AND  SETTING RATION?
NOT REALLY. THESE DAYS CLASS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RACE. LIKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. MY KIDS DON'T NEED IT. MY DAUGHTER TOOK A SPOT FROM A WHITE KID AT PRINCETON, HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE UPSET. GOOD LUCK, BABY.
Jon: SO YOU THINK VOTING MONOWILLITICALLY HAS HURT THE  BLACK COMMUNITY'S VOTING POWER?
OF COURSE, JON. THIS IS THE LAST TIME. IT'S TIME THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITY'S POLITICAL STRUCTURE REFLECT THE I HAVE TERSE -- THE DIVERSITY. IF YOU'RE A BLACK CONSERVATIVE GUN-SHY ABOUT JOINING THE TEA PARTY, START THE SWEET TEA PARTY. I DON'T CARE.
Jon: AND LIBERAL BLACKS COULD HAVE LIKE MOVIN'-ON-UP-DOT-ORG.
UH-UH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO YOU THINK THE BLACK COMMUNITY SHOULD VOTE THEIR INDIVIDUAL SELF-INTEREST, EVEN  IF THAT MEANINGS VOTING REPUBLICAN?
SURE, JON. THERE'S A LOT OF REPUBLICANS I CAN SEE SUPPORTING. WHO IS THAT BROTHER WHO DELIVERS THE PIZZA?
Jon: THAT'S HERMAN CAIN. HE'S NOT A DELIVERY GUY. HE'S THE FORMER C.E.O. OF GODFATHER'S PIZZA.
DOES HE STILL HAVE ACCESS TO PIZZAS?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
I COULD SUPPORT HIM. MAYBE THEY CAN THROW IN A TWO LITER...
Jon: ARE YOU PLACING AN ORDER, LARRY IN
YEAH, DAMN RIGHT, JON. YOU WANT SOMETHING?
Jon: NO, I DON'T. LARRY, THANK YOU. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY.
