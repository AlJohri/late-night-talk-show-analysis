Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND ENGINEERING AT  THE UNIVERSITIES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE END OFIMNESS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DR. DAVID AGUS. (APPLAUSE) HELLO, SIR. GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS CALLED THE END OF ILLNESS. DR. AGUS, BEFORE WE TALK, IS THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW, DOES  THAT COUNT AS ME GOING OUT OF NETWORK? IS THAT.
YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR DEDUCTIBLE UP FRONT BUT WE'RE GOING TO COLLECT IT.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
GREAT. THIS IS A PHENOMENAL, I AM A JEW, I'M JEWISH. SO I THINK A LOT ABOUT ILLNESS. BUT TYPICALLY NOT THE END OF IT. I'M USUALLY THINKING PORE ABOUT THE BEGINNINGS OF IT. A FASCINATING WAY TO LOOK AT IT. SUMMARIZE FOR ME SORT OF YOUR THESIS STATEMENT ABOUT THE WAY WE HAVE VIEWED  ILLNESS INCORRECTLY IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE LACK AT IT DOWN DEEP, ONE LITTLE FACTOR. SO TO ME YOU HAVE CANCER. YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE. WELL, TO ME THOSE DISEASES ARE VERBS. YOU ARE CAN SERG, YOU ARE HEART DISEASING. AND I WANT TO TAKE YOU FROM A CANCER STATE THE OTHER DIRECTION. AND I WANT TO PREVENT ILLNESS. I'M A GUY WHO SEES PEOPLE DYING OF CANCER EVERY DAY. I DON'T WANT-- RZ ARE YOU ONCOLOGIST.
I'M A CANCER DOCTOR. I WANT TO PREVENT DISEASE. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE THE MEANS TO DO IT. WE JUST HAVE GOT TO ENACT IT.
Jon: WE HAVE BECOME A COUNTRY THAT TREATS DISEASE BUT DOES NOT PREVENT IT. YOU MAKE THE CASE THAT INFLAMMATION IS REALLY THE CULPRIT IN MUCH OF THIS.
YEAH, IT'S THE ROOT CAUSE OF THINGS LIKE HEART DISEASE, CANCER. WE CAN REDUCE INFLAMMATION. YOU ARE TAKING ASPIRIN AN DAY REDUCES INFLAMMATION, LOWERS YOUR RATE OF CANCER DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE AS WELL AS A DRAMATIC AFFECT ON HEART DISEASE. WHY AREN'T WE MANDATING IT?
WE LIKE CANCER? BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING, YOU TALK ABOUT HOW DISCOVERING MICROBES, BACTERIAL ENVIRONMENTS ACTUALLY TURNED  OUT TO IN SOME WAYS SET MEDICINE BACK BECAUSE WE NO LONGER THERE IS A VERY  INTERESTING THING IN HERE WRITTEN IN THE 1920s BY A PHYSICIAN WHO IS TALKING  ABOUT HOW PASTURE AND THOSE GUYS KIND OF RUINED THE WAY WE LOOK AT HEALTH.
PRETTY COOL, YOU REALLY READ THE BOOK. I LOVE IT.
IT'S ABOUT ILLNESS. I'VE BEEN READING THIS FOR 49 YEARS.
SO 1920s WE MADE A DRUG TO TREAT INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAD  A DIAGNOSIS, YOU HAD A CURE. WE THOUGHT ALL DISEASES WOULD BE LIKE THAT. WELL CANCER ISN'T FROM WITHOUT, IT'S FROM WITHIN. THAT BACTERIA DOESN'T CARE IF ARE YOU TALL, SHORT, ROUND, FAT, GREEN, WHITE. IT IS JUST AN ANT BIOTIC. CANCER, HEART DISEASE, ALZHEIMER, THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT. IT IS THE INTERACTION. YOU HAVE TO TREAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM. IT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HEALTH. AS WE CALL IT,.
Jon: AND SO MANY MORE OF US DIE FROM THESE COMPLEX INFLAMMATORY DISEASES THAN  THESE PATHOGENS.
EVOLUTION SELECTS OUT FOR WHO HAS GOOD KIDS. IT DOESN'T SELECT OUT FOR WHO-- WITH YOU NEVER MET MY GRANDCHILDREN.
DARWIN WASN'T ALWAYS SO SMART.
Jon: I'M KIDDING. I'M SURE GOITERS HAVE SOME EVOLUTIONARY REASON FOR EXISTING.
YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE BEING SEDENTARY, EVEN AFTER DOING EXERCISE IN THE  MORNING, BEING SEDENTARY IS AS BAD FOR YOU AS SMOKING. NOW I QUIT SMOKE BEING TEN YEARS AGO BUT I STILL-- BUT HEAR'S, LET ME GET TO WHAT I  AM GETTING TO, BUT I STILL SIT ON MY ASS. SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS, IF RI WERE TO GET RID OF MY DESK CAN I GO BACK TO SMOKING?
IT'S NOT A BINARY, YOU CAN'T DO ONE OR THE OTHER.
ALL RIGHT, BUT THE DATA ARE JUST AMAZING. 1953 THEY LOOK AT THE BRITISH TRANSIT AUTHORITY WORKERS, OVER 20,000. HALF WERE THE BUS DRIVERS THAT SAT THERE 90%, AND HALF THE TICKET TAKERS THAT  WALKED AND TOOK THE TICKETS. SAME WEIGHT AMONG THEM BUT HALF THE DEATH RATE OF HEART DISEASE IN THE TICKET TAKERS. WE GOT TO MOVE DURING THE DAY. MAKES A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE DO.
SO IS THIS, WHY DOESN'T THIS CATCH ON? IT DOESN'T SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE OTHER THAN THE VITAMIN THING. THERE IS A VITAMIN THING IN HERE. YOU SAY SAY VITAMINS ACTUALLY COULD CAUSE US MORE HARM.
THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS 200 MILLION, OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT TO LOOK AT VIT MEN E TO  PREVENT PROSTATE CANCER. 17% HIGHER INCIDENCE WHEN YOU TAKE IT FOR THREE YEARS. YOU STOP IT, THAT LASTS FOR THREE YEARS AFTER STOPPING IT. THE MOST COMMON NONSKIN CANCER IN MEN, 17% HIGHER, WHAT AM I MISSING. WHY ARE WE TAKING THESE. 50 LARGE STUDIES OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE, NEVER A BENEFIT IN HEART DISEASE AND CANCER. I DON'T GET IT.
Jon: WHY IS, WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME ALLOWING SCIENCE TO OVERCOME  OUR IRRATIONALITY. BECAUSE IF YOU-- LIKE I'M VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE WHOLE LIKE HERE'S SOME FISH  OIL PILLS AND CHEW THIS UP AND YOU WILL BE FINE. AND THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER TO ME THAN THAT THING YOU JUST SAID ABOUT WALKING. (LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE IT'S HOPE. IT'S SIMPLE AND IT'S HOPE. WE WANT TO DO THINGS VERY QUICKLY, VERY EASILY IN OUR COUNTRY. A PILL IS A GREAT WAY TO DO IT FORGET ABOUT FOOD, I WILL JUST TAKE THAT PILL. IT IS EMPOWERING TO JUST SPEND $20 IN VITAMINS. WE HAVE TO CHANINGT CULTURE. REAL FOOD. YOU EAT YOUR LUNCH TODAY AT NOON. FOR TWO HOURS YOUR STRESS HORMONES GO UP, YOU DON'T THINK AS WELL, YOU DON'T  FUNCTION AS WELL, OVER TIME YOU GAIN WEIGHT BECAUSE YOURED ABOUTEE SHUTS DOWN  METABOLISM TO SAVE ENERGY. REGULAR SCHEDULE MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.
Jon: I'M NEVER HAVING LUNCH AGAIN.
THAT'S THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO TAKE FROM THIS, ISN'T IT?
THE BOOK IS PHENOMENAL. AND FOR ANYBODY WHO IS IN ANY WAY ON WEB MD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FU  [BLEEP] THIS LUMP S, THE END OF ILLNESS ON THE BOOKSHELF
