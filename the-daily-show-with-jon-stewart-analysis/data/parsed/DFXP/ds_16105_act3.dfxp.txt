Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE CENTER  OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JOHN COFFEE. HAVE A SEAT. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE.
YOU ARE THE HEAD OF THE CENTER FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE FREE MARKET LIKE THAT, SIR. THAT DOESN'T SEEM... IT'S A SOCIALIST OPERATION YOU'RE RUNNING OVER THERE.
THAT'S BEEN SAID.
Jon: HAS IT REALLY BEEN SAID IN
YEAH.
Jon: OH, MAN. THE RATINGS AGENCY STANDARD & POOR'S, THEY COME OUT ON FRIDAY  AND THEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DOWNGRADE US. IS THAT THE SITUATION? OR THEY CAME OUT... WHEN DID THEY COME OUT AND SAY THEY'RE GOING TO DOWNGRADE US.
IT CAME OUT AFTER SOME NEGOTIATION WITH THE TREASURY. SO EVERYONE IN WASHINGTON KNEW IT WAS COMING, AND THEY STAYED WITH THEIR POSITION, AND IT CAME  OUT FRIDAY AND THEN THE MARKET RESPONDED ON MONDAY.
Jon: IS STANDARD & POOR'S, THEY HAD A VERY POOR TRACK RECORD IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN. THEY HAD BEEN GRANTING TRIPLE-A STATUS TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CORPORATE BONDS, YES?
ALL OF THEM, STANDARD & POOR'S, MOODY'S, THE BIG THREE  SYSTEMATICALLY INFLATED THEIR RATINGS AND PROBABLY WERE THE GROUP MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  FINANCIAL COLLAPSE IN 2008. IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THEM.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S EXCITING TO HEAR. [LAUGHTER] NOW, SO THEY HAD BEEN LET'S SAY AN EASY GRADER. YOU'RE A PROFESSOR. LET'S SAY YOU'RE KNOWN AS AN EASY PROFESSOR. YOU TAKE MY CLASS, YOU GET AN A. SO I SIGN UP FOR YOUR CLASS. AND I COME IN AND YOU GO, D. DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT I AM EVEN WORSE THAN A.I.G. AND THESE OTHER DERIVATIVE PLACES THAT GOT  THE TRIPLE-As?
YOU NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE. STANDARD & POOR'S WAS PAID BY THE PEOPLE THEY WERE RATING IN ALL OF THOSE OTHER CASES. BUT WHEN WE TURN TO A COUNTRY OR SOVEREIGN DEBT, THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR THE RATING, AND NOW  THEY BECOME STRANGELY ENOUGH INDEPENDENT.
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS: I THINK I CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM. [LAUGHTER]
YES.
Jon: ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME WITH WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE? HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT? LET'S PAY THEM AND WE'RE DONE. WE'LL BE DONE WITH THE WHOLE THING. [APPLAUSE]
A COUPLE YEARS AGO, THAT DID HAPPEN. THAT'S HOW ALL THOSE TRIPLE-As CAME FROM, SOMETIMES THE FEE PAID THE RATING AGENCY, MIGHT BE  $5 MILLION OR MORE, AND WAS ALWAYS BASED ON WHAT RATING YOU GAVE THEM. IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS IN VERY SIMPLE TERMS.
Jon: YES.
IT'S LIKE A BASEBALL LEAGUE IN WHICH THE HOME TEAM HIRES THE  UMPIRE, PAYS THE UMPIRE AFTER EACH INNING, TELLS THE UMPIRE THE FEE WILL BE BASED ON THE  QUALITY OF HIS PERFORMANCE AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE HIS PERFORMANCE HE'LL NEVER UMPIRE  IN THEIR STADIUM AGAIN. THAT'S THE FUNCTIONAL ANALOGY.
Jon: NOW, AGAIN, I HAPPEN TO FOLLOW BASEBALL... [LAUGHTER] THAT'S INSANE. THAT'S AN INSANE SYSTEM. NOW, WE DID HAVE IN THE DODD-FRANK BILL A CENTER THAT WAS GOING TO OPEN UP, AN OFFICE  THAT WAS GOING TO THROUGH GOVERNANCE REGULATE THESE RATINGS AGENCIES. IT WAS WRITTEN INTO THE DODD-FRANK BILL. HOW IS THAT GOING?
IT'S NOT BEEN FUNDED. THE SEC CAN'T SET IT UP WITHOUT THE FUNDS.
Jon: SO WE SET THIS THING UP A YEAR AGO TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM RATINGS AGE SIX, BUT WE HAVEN'T OPENED THE OFFICE YET BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MONEY FOR IT.
YOU GOT IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AS A PROFESSOR, AS MAN OF KNOWLEDGE, DO YOU EVER WANT TO IN THREE STOOGES PARLANCE  GO --  [APPLAUSE] I HONESTLY FOR THE LIFE OF ME DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN OURSELVES INTO THIS  POSITION IN ANY RATIONAL WAY.
YOU KNOW, A GUY IN YOUR PROFESSION HAS HAD THE ONLY LONG CAL ANSWER. A MAN CALLED AL FRANKEN WHO STARTED OUT IN YOUR FIELD AND PROVED ON TO A HIGHER FORM OF COMEDY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HE HAS A PROPOSAL THAT WILL REALLY WORK. IN THAT DODD-FRANK ACT, THERE IS HIS PROVISION THAT SAYS THE SEC SHOULD STUDY, HE WANTED TO ADOPT  IT, BUT IT ONLY WENT THROUGH IS THE SEC SHOULD STUDY WHETHER WE SHOULD SEPARATE THE PAYMENT OF  THE RATING AGENCY FROM THE SELECTION OF THE RATING AGENCY, SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE THE CHOICE TO INVESTORS AND HAVE THE PAYMENT STILL COME FROM THE ISSUER. THAT COULD WORK, BUT ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS STUDY IT FOR ONE MORE YEAR.
Jon: WHO FIGHTS IT? DO THE RATINGS AGENCIES FIGHT THIS? DO THE CORPORATIONS FIGHT THIS? AND WHY CAN'T SOVEREIGN NATIONS GET IN ON THAT GRAVE I HAVE TRAIN?
WELL, SOVEREIGN NATIONS DON'T PAY. THEY MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE IN NOT PAYING. IT'S NOT SO MUCH CORPORATIONS. IT'S BAYICALLY THE INVESTMENT BANKS. WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE LAST DECADE IS ALL OF THESE ASSET BACKED SECURITIZATIONS THAT  YOU'VE SOME WHEAT HEARD ABOUT, THEY'RE ALL ISSUED BY MAYBE SEVEN TO EIGHT INVESTMENT BANKS.
Jon: AND THESE ARE THE C.E.O.S THAT TOOK ALL THESE MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND SPREAD  THEM OUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD?
FLOODED THE WORLD WITH THEM. AS THE QUALITY WENT DOWN, THE RATINGS WENT UP, BUT ONLY SEVEN OR EIGHT INVESTMENT BANKS DID  THAT, AND THEY HAD REAL MARKET POWER OVER THE RATING AGENCY, WHEREAS INDIVIDUAL CORPORATIONS GO TO THE MARKET ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS, DON'T HAVE THE SAME CLOUT.
Jon: NOW, WHY THEN DID INVESTORS FREAK OUT WHEN STANDARD & POOR'S DOWNGRADED OUR DEBT. THE MONEY HAS BEEN FLOWING OUT OF THE STOP EVER SINCE THAT HAPPENED. HERE'S THE PART THAT FREAKS ME OUT THE MOST: THE INVESTORS OF THESE LARGE BANKS AND EVERYTHING  ARE POURING THEIR MONEY INTO U.S. TREASURIES, THE VERY THING THAT HAS JUST BEEN COULDN'T --  DOWN GRADED AS MORE OF A RISK. HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, STANDARD & POOR'S DOWNGRADE WAS PROBABLY  THE SPARK THAT SET OFF THE POWDER KEG THAT'S BEEN SITTING THERE. THE POWDER KEG IS THE PARALYSIS IN CONGRESS, WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE DEALT WITH BEFORE.
Jon: FAMILIAR WITH IT.
AND THE MESS IN EUROPE. STANDARD & POOR'S DID THE SAME THING WITH GREECE, ITALY, SPAIN, PORTUGAL, AND THE EXPERIENCE THERE WAS THAT DOWNGRADING CREATED SOMETHING OF A PANIC. SO THERE WAS A PANIC, BUT WHEN INVESTORS HAD THE CHOOSE, STILL THE SAFEST THING AROUND WAS  EITHER U.S. TREASURIES OR GOLD, SO MUCH OF IT WENT INTO U.S. TREASURIES.
Jon: IT JUST FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT GOT US INTO THIS MESS, THAT DESTROYED  THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR ECONOMY AS IT'S CRUMBLING DOWN CAME TO US WITH THE BAGS OF  MONEY THEY WERE ABLE TO GET OUT AND GO, CAN YOU HOLD THIS FOR ME UNTIL THIS ALL GETS FIXED.
YES, GOOD. I LIKE THAT ANALOGY. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING US THE OVERVIEW. WE APPRECIATE IT. PROFESSOR JOHN COFFEE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. [APPLAUSE]
