FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE PREPARED A PROGRAM FOR YOU THIS EVENING, VERY EXCITING. TONIGHT'S GUEST, CHRISTOPHER WALKEN WHO IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HE'S IN A NEW MOVIE CALLED "JERSEY BOYS." "JERSEY BOYS," THE STORY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHO ACHIEVED SUCCESS DESPITE THE REALLY THE TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE OF BEING FROM NEW JERSEY. [LAUGHTER] WE DO THE BEST WE CAN. BUT FIRST, REMEMBER THAT COUNTRY WE INVADED A LITTLE WHILE BACK. THAT WAS, NO, NO, THAT WAS TOO FAR BACK. NO, NO, THAT WAS... NO, THAT WAS A SHADOW COUP. THAT WASN'T AN INVASION. THAT WAS A POLICE ACTION. THAT WAS A GIANT STEP FOR ALL MANKIND. I'M TALKING ABOUT IRAQ. THAT'S THE ROCK. THAT'S... THANK YOU. IRAQ. REMEMBER? WE INVADED IT BECAUSE 9/11 AND WEAPONS AND THEN WE HAD TO PRETEND THAT WE WERE REALLY TRYING BRING DEMOCRACY AND STABILITY TO THE MIDDLE EAST. I MEAN, DON'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE, BUT I GUESS HISTORY WILL BE THE JUDGE.
IN IRAQ WHERE AMERICAN TROOPS LEFT MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO, INSURGENTS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK THIS MORNING. THE COUNTRY'S SECOND LARGEST CITY, MOSUL, IS UNDER CONTROL OF MILITANTS.
Jon: WHOA. SLOW DOWN, JUDGE HISTORY. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE MILITANTS TOOK MOSUL, TWO MILLION PEOPLE. WELL, THOSE REBELS ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL TRYING CORRAL THAT TOWN.
TIKRIT, THAT'S SADDAM'S HOMETOWN, GONE. THE EXTREMISTS CONTROL THAT.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEPED]. TIKRIT, TOO, THEY TOOK TIKRIT? TIKRIT AND MOSUL, THE TWIN CITIES, AS NO ONE THERE CALLS THEM. [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH NOW I THINK THE MILITANTS WILL PROBABLY CONSOLIDATE THEIR GAINS, FORTIFY THEIR POSITION RESEARCH SCHOOLS FOR THEIR KIDS MAYBE.
THE MILITANTS ARE ADVANCING TOWARDS IRAQ'S CAPITAL OF BAGHDAD.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS GOING ON OVER THERE. HOW ARE THE MILITANTS MOVING SO QUICKLY? IS IT... EZ PASS. [LAUGHTER] AND WE BROUGHT THAT THERE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NO. DON'T CHEER FOR THE MILITANTS. I DIDN'T THINK WE'D HAVE DO THIS ANYMORE. WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RETURN TO OUR OLD COVERAGE. LET ME JUST GET THIS OUT THERE. LET ME JUST GET... LET ME GET IT. THERE WE GO. [LAUGHTER] MESS 'O POTAMIA COVERAGE IS BACK. [APPLAUSE] SO WHO ARE THESE MILITANT OVERACHIEVERS?
THE MILITANTS BELONG TO THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA OR I.S.I.S.
THEIR AMBITION IS TO CREATE A MUSLIM CALIFATE, A SINGLE ISLAM STATE.
THEIR LEADER, ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI.
44 YEARS OLD, WAS A HIGHLY REGARDED PROFESSOR, HAS A MASTER'S DEGREE AND Ph.D. IN ISLAMIC STUDIES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BAGHDAD.
Jon: OH, DID YOU HEAR THAT, LADIES? HE'S A DOCTOR. [LAUGHTER] A BRUTAL DOCTOR. GUESS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TIPPED OFF BY HIS Ph.D. DISSERTATION. [LAUGHTER] SO TECHNICALLY HE'S DR. AL-BAGHDADI. WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS GUY?
SOME ANALYSTS CALL HIM THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL JIHADI LEADER. HE'S ALSO SAID TO BE MORE VIOLENT AND MORE ANTI-AMERICAN THAN OSAMA BIN LADEN EVER WAS.
Jon: OKAY. OKAY. MORE VIOLENT? FINE. BUT REALLY? MORE ANTI-AMERICAN THAN BIN LADEN? COME ON. GUY'S AT THE TOP OF THE ANTI-AMERICAN... SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME IF AL-BAGHDADI AND BIN LADEN ARE HAVING AN ARGUMENT ABOUT AMERICA, BIN LADEN IS THE ONE GOING, NO, LOOK, I HATE THEM TOO, I'M JUST SAYING. [LAUGHTER] NOBODY DOES A THEME PARK LIKE THE AMERICANS. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S A REASON IT'S NOT CALLED "THE GREAT AFGHANI SCREAM MACHINE." WELL, EITHER WAY, DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE NEWS FLASH MOTHER [BLEEPED], YOU MAY HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST MILITIA HEADED BY A REAL-LIFE SUPERVILLAIN, BUT IRAQ HAS SOMETHING EVEN BETTER.
THE UNITED STATES SPENT $17 BILLION TO HELP TRAIN AND EQUIP IRAQI SECURITY FORCES.
Jon: AMERICA, [BLEEPED] YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THE AMERICA-TRAINED, AMERICA-FUNDED, BAD-ASS, BUTT-KICKING IRAQI SECURITY FORCES. LOOKS LIKE THE ISIS MILITANTS ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE HURT LOCKER.
THE IRAQI FORCES THAT WERE TRAINED BY THE U.S., THEY JUST SIMPLY RAN.
STRIPPING THEIR UNIFORMS, LEAVING THEM IN THE STREETS, AND ABANDONING THEIR POSTS, WEAPONS AND VEHICLES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID I SAY HURT LOCKER? I MEANT THE LOCKER WHERE YOU KEEP THE UNIFORMS AND OTHER STUFF YOU DISCARD WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY. BY THE WAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE STUFF WE PROBABLY LEFT OVER THERE?
THE TERRORIST GROUP OVERRAN A MILITARY BASE. AMERICANS SUPPLIED HUMVEES, WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION. NOW IN THEIR HANDS.
Jon: HA! JOKES ON YOU, WE HAD FAILED TO PROPERLY UP-ARMOR MANY OF THOSE VEHICLES. GOTCHA. IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS TO REPORT HERE?
THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT IS NOW REACHING OUT FOR HELP, ASKING THE U.S. MILITARY TO FLY COMBAT MISSIONS, DRONES, PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE TO REVERSE THIS ADVANCE FROM THIS GROUP.
Jon: YES! WE DID IT! WE FINALLY GOT IT SO THAT IRAQ WILL NOW GREET US AS LIBERATORS. [LAUGHTER] WAY TO GO, EVERYBODY. [BLEEPED] SENIOR IRAQ WAR CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES IS IN BAGHDAD NOW. JASON JONES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JASON, WHAT'S THE LATEST?
JON, THE TACTICAL SITUATION IS DETERIORATING HERE FAST.
Jon: JASON, I'M SORRY. THE SHIRT, THE HAWAIIAN SHIRT, AND YOU'RE HAVING A DRINK THERE. YOU'RE A WAR CORRESPONDENT.
YEAH, AND YESTERDAY I WASN'T A WAR CORRESPONDENT, JON. I WAS JUST ANOTHER GUY ENJOYING HIS VACATION IN IRAQ'S VIBRANT, UTOPIAN DEMOCRACY. COPYRIGHT 2003, U.S. OF A. IT HAD EVERYTHING HERE, JON, SUN, SAND, MORE SAND.
Jon: YES.
BUT I GUESS IRAQ HAS DECIDED DEMOCRACY IS NOT THEIR THING.
Jon: WELL, WHAT IS THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT DOING?
WELL, THERE ARE A FEW OPTIONS. THEY'RE STRIPPING OFF THEIR UNIFORMS AND RUNNING. THAT'S ONE. BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK, SOME LOWER-LEVEL PARLIAMENTARY TALK OF RUNNING FASTER WITH LESS CLOTHES.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. BUT THE MILITANTS OBVIOUSLY HAVE TRUCKS AND GUNS, MOSTLY AMERICAN TRUCKS AND GUNS, SO THE RUNNING PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK.
WELL, THERE IS ONE OTHER OPTION, JON. THERE'S AN OLD IRAQI SAYING...
Jon: YEAH.
THE ONLY THING THAT STOPS A BAD GUY WITH A GUN
Jon: YEAH.
IS A TRULY HORRIBLE GUY WITH A GUN.
Jon: REALLY? YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RETURNING AN OPPRESSIVE, STRONG-ARM DICTATOR TO POWER.
EXACTLY, OR AS THEY CALL IT HERE IN IRAQ, "IRAQ CLASSIC."
Jon: REALLY? WELL, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, THOUGH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND A DICTATOR? WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?
YOU'LL SEE. JUST CONTINUE.
Jon: JASON, THIS IS... WHOA. JASON, SOMEHOW THAT POPPED ALL THE WAY BACK HERE TO NEW YORK.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: THAT WAS WEIRD. YOU TOOK OFF YOUR SHIRT IN BAGHDAD AND I ALMOST TOOK A BUTTON IN THE EYE BACK HERE IN NEW YORK. THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING.
POWERFUL POP, JON.
Jon: POWERFUL POP. THIS IS THE STUPIDEST IDEA YOU EVER -- HOLY [BLEEPED] JASON! WOW.
RIGHT? COME ON.
Jon: WOW!
YEAH. [APPLAUSE] THE 'STACHE REALLY PULLS THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER.
Jon: BOY, YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.
YEAH, THAT AND THE HUGE GUN COLLECTION.
Jon: JASON, I REALLY DON'T THINK THE IRAQI PEOPLE WILL FALL FOR THIS. IT'S NOT...
HEY, EVERYONE, I'M BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WOW.
YES, I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU, AND THEN IMPRISON AND TORTURE YOU.
Jon: SADDAM HUSSEIN IS BACK, EVERYONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
