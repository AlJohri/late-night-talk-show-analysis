Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE AUTHOR  SALMAN RUSHDIE. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHICH EVENTS  CURRENTLY IN THE NEWS WILL BE  DISCUSSED. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, REMEMBER THE REPUBLICAN  CONVENTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE TWO  WEEKS AGO. BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE MITT  ROMNEY.
HE WILL HAVE HIS FIRST MAJOR  NATIONAL PLATFORM TO INTRODUCE  HIMSELF AND HIS IDEAS TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon: YES! (LAUGHTER)  AFTER ONLY A SOLID, LET'S SAY,  SEVEN YEARS ON THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL. (LAUGHTER)  MITT ROMNEY FINALLY HAD A PRIME  TIME TELEVISION SLOT TO  INTRODUCE HIMSELF TO THE VOTERS. AND ULTIMATELY ENDED UP GETTING  UPSTAGED BY A PIECE OF WOOD. ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  A PIECE OF WOOD WHO SPENT MOST  OF HIS TIME TALKING TO A CHAIR. BOOM! (LAUGHTER)  BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NO. I STILL LOVE CLINT EASTWOOD. I'M GOING ON RECORD. STILL LOVE CLINT EASTWOOD. ALL RIGHT, JUST THREE WEEKS  AFTER BEING UPSTAGE BID A CHAIR  AND COMPLETELY BOTCHING HIS  RESPONSE TO THE HORRIBLE EVENTS IN LIBYA, A NEW ANNOUNCEMENT  FROM THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN.
THE ROMNEY CAMP IS SAID TO BE  ENGINEERING A REBOOT.
CALL IT A ROMNEY RESET.
WE BEGIN WITH MITT ROMNEY  WHO'S JUST UNVEILED A NEW  CAMPAIGN STRATEGY.
Jon: DID WE SAY WE WERE  GONNA INTRODUCE HIM AT THE  CONVENTION? NO, NO. THAT'S NOT--  (LAUGHTER). YOU ALWAYS REINTRODUCE THE  CANDIDATE THREE WEEKS AFTER THE  CONVENTION. (LAUGHTER)  SORT OF LIKE SAYING TO A GIRL  "COME ON, JUST GO ON A SEVENTH  DATE WITH ME."  (LAUGHTER)  "I'LL GROW ON YOU." (LAUGHTER)  SO THE BIG ROLLOUT OF ROMNEY 9.0  STARTED YESTERDAY. HOW'D THE REBOOT GO.
TOPPING THE AGENDA TODAY,  MITT ROMNEY IN DAMAGE CONTROL  MODE.
Jon: ON DAY ONE OF THE  REBOOT? (LAUGHTER)  YES, THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN'S  REBOOT WAS SPOILED BY FOOTAGE  FROM LAST MAY OF GOVERNOR ROMNEY AT A $50,000 A PLATE FUND-RAISER  TALKING TO RICH PEOPLE ABOUT  POORER PEOPLE IN A MANNER YOU  WOULD IMAGINE CARTOON RICH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CARTOON POORER  PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)
THERE ARE 47% OF THE PEOPLE  WHO WILL VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT  NO MATTER WHAT WHO ARE DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT, WHO BELIEVE THAT  THEY ARE VICTIMS. WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE  ENTITLED TO HEALTH CARE, TO  FOOD, TO HOUSING, TO YOU NAME  IT.
Jon: RELEASE THE HOUND. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  WHO ARE THEY? WHO ARE THESE 47%ERS? THESE SELF-PERCEIVED VICTIMS WHO  ONLY WANT TO STUCK FROM THE TEET  OF THE BOOTSTRAP OF THE JOB  CREATING-- TEET-HAVING BOOT-TEET-- JUST TELL US WHO  THEY ARE.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO PAY NO  INCOME TAXES. SO MY JOB IS NOT TO WORRY ABOUT  THOSE PEOPLE. I'LL NEVER GET THEIR SUPPORT. THEY SHOULD TAKE PERSONAL  RESPONSIBILITY AND CARE FOR  THEIR OWN LIVES.
Jon: DID YOU HEAR IT? DID YOU WRITE THAT DOWN? THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY INCOME  TAX. THESE 47% OF THIS COUNTRY THAT  WILL NEVER BE CONVINCED TO TAKE  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR  THEIR LIVES. THEY ARE UNCONVINCABLE. EVEN BY A MAN OF SUCH PERSUASIVE  ABILITIES AS MITT ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER)  EVEN HE WHOSE CHARISMA HAS BEEN  COMPARED NOT UNFAVORABLY WITH A  1993 CHRYSLER HE BARREN. (LAUGHTER)  EVEN HE-- WHO ARE THESE 47%ERS? LET'S EXAMINE IT. IT TURNS OUT OF THE 47% WHO PAY  NO INCOME TAXES, NEARLY  TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE DO PAY  PAYROLL TAXES. MEANING THEY WORK, THEY JUST  AIN'T WORKING HARD ENOUGH. YOU KNOW, LIKE A FAMILY OF FIVE  MAKING $50,000 A YEAR. A.K.A., THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT  TAKES TO SEE MITT ROMNEY (BLEEP)  ON THEM IN PERSON. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE OTHER 40%, THE TRUE  FREELOADERS. SETTLE DOWN. THE OTHER 40% OF THE 47%, THE  TRUE FREELOADERS WHO PAY NO  FEDERAL INCOME TAX OR PAYROLL  TAX ARE ACTUALLY MADE UP OF THOSE MAKING LESS THAN $20,000 A  YEAR AND MANY OF THE NATION'S  ELDERLY. MR. ROMNEY KNOWS THEM AS  "PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY  SHIRKING UNCONVINCABLES."  YOU MAY KNOW THEM AS "THE GREATEST GENERATION" AND/OR  "THAT THAT."  (LAUGHTER)  OF COURSE, THAT SAYS NOTHING  ABOUT THE REAL PARASITES, WELFARE QUEENS. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IS CLEARLY A  PATH TO DEPENDENCY AND I WOULD  LIKE TO SEE EVIDENCE OTHERWISE. OH, YOU HAVE SOME EVIDENCE, MITT  ROMNEY'S MOM? SOMETHING ABOUT MITT ROMNEY'S  DAD?
YOU KNOW WE'VE ONLY OWNED OUR  HOME FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. HE WAS A REFUGEE FROM MEXICO. HE WAS ON RELIEF, WELFARE RELIEF  FOR THE FIRST YEARS OF HIS LIFE. BUT THIS GREAT COUNTRY GAVE HIM  OPPORTUNITIES.
Jon: OH. MY. GOD. (LAUGHTER)  GEORGE ROMNEY WAS ON WELFARE. SO ACCORDING TO MITT ROMNEY'S  OWN LOGIC, MITT ROMNEY COULD NOT  WIN THE VOTE OF HIS DAD. (LAUGHTER)  WHO WOULD BE ONE OF THE 47% OF  UNCONVINCABLES. AND THE HITS KEEP COMING. ROMNEY CONTINUES IN THE VIDEO  SUGGEST THE PALESTINIANS DON'T  WANT PEACE AND ALL WE CAN DO IN  THE MIDDLE EAST IS KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND HOPE FOR THE  BEST AND THAT, WHILE HIS DAD WAS  BORN IN MEXICO HE,  UNFORTUNATELY, DOESN'T GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THAT.
I'D HAVE A BETTER SHOT OF  WINNING THIS. MY DAD WAS NOT BORN IN MEXICO. HE WAS LIVING IN THERE FOR A  NUMBER OF YEARS. I SAY THAT JOKINGLY. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T MAKE THE JOKE AND THEN  IMMEDIATELY DOUBLE DOWN ON THE  SERIOUSNESS OF THE PREMISE. "HEY, JIMMY'S MOM, WHAT A WHORE. I'M KIDDING. BUT SERIOUSLY, SHE EARNS HER  LIVING HAVING SEX WITH PEOPLE."  (APPLAUSE)  THAT'S NOT A WAY-- BY THE END OF THIS TAPE, THE ONLY PERSON WHO  WHOSE SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY MIGHT  BE ABLE TO COUNT ON HOLDING IS  HIS OWN WIFE.
WE USE ANNE SPARINGLY RIGHT  NOW SO PEOPLE DON'T GET TIRED OF  HER OR START ATTACKING. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: HEY, HEY. NO, HEY, HEY, SHOW ME A  BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND I'LL SHOW  YOU SOMEONE TIRED OF CAMPAIGNING  WITH HER, AM I RIGHT, HUH? I'M KIDDING, OF COURSE. I'M KIDDING. BUT SERIOUSLY, IT IS UNBEARABLE. (LAUGHTER)  NEEDLESS TO SAY, MITT ROMNEY HAD  TO ADDRESS THIS SITUATION  MID-REBOOT.
GOOD EVENING. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A  VIDEO THAT'S BEEN ON THE  INTERNET FOR A FEW WEEKS THAT  HAS ATTRACTED SOME ATTENTION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT PRETTY MUCH  DESCRIBES EVERY VIDEO ON THE  INTERNET. (LAUGHTER)  ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT GANGNAM  STYLE? PANDA SNEEZING? OH, RIGHT, THE VIDEO OF YOU  DISRESPECTING 47% OF AMERICANS. THAT'S WHY YOU JUST CASUALLY  INTERRUPTED A BIG FUND-RAISER AT  10:30 AT NIGHT WITH THE MITT  ROMNEY VERSION OF BED HEAD.
THIS IS REALLY A DISCUSSION  ABOUT THE POLITICAL PROCESS OF  WINNING THE ELECTION AND, OF  COURSE, I WANT TO HELP ALL AMERICANS, ALL AMERICANS, HAVE A  BRIGHT AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE.
Jon: SURE, YEAH, NO, WOW. HIS WORDS SAY "NO BIG DEAL, I  WANT TO HELP ALL AMERICANS."  BUT HIS EYES AND BODY LANGUAGE  SAY "HOLY (BLEEP), WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!"  (LAUGHTER)  LET ME GIVE YOU A BETTER EXAMPLE  TO ILLUSTRATE THE DICHOTOMY  BETWEEN THE MESSAGE MITT ROMNEY IS SENDING VERBALLY AND THE  MESSAGE HE'S SENDING VISUALLY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I TAKE YOU  TO A CRUISE SHIP SOMEWHERE IN  THE NORTH ATLANTIC. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S  ME, YOUR CAPTAIN. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S BEEN SOME  TALK OF ICE ON THE STAR BOARD  SIDE OF THE SHIP. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S ATTRACTED SOME ATTENTION. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ANYWAY, I-- I JUST WANT TO TAKE  A MOMENT TO REASSURE EVERYBODY  WE HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO  REACHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE  OCEAN WITH EVERYBODY NOT IN A  WATERY GRAVE. (LAUGHTER)  THIS WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER IF  I WAS LATINO. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
