[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE BEST SELLING AUTHOR OF THE GOD DELUSION. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "AN APPETITE FOR WONDER." PLEASE WELCOME RICHARD DAWKINS. SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE BOOK IS CALLED "AN APPETITE FOR WONDER. AND LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU WITH THE MOP TOP AND THE -- YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN A BAND WITH THAT.
THAT'S WHAT I CALL THE GRINNING IDIOT PICTURE. THE BRITISH ONE HAS THE RUPERT BROOKS PICTURE THE SIDEWAYS POETIC LOOK.
Jon: YOU HAVE BOTH OF THOSE, DO YOU? FAIR ENOUGH. THERE'S A LIBERAL PRESBYTERIAN PASTOR IN MY AUDIENCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN I SAY LIBERAL, HERE IS HOW LIBERAL HE IS, HE IS JEWISH. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, YOU SEEM TO BE THE AVATAR FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND SCIENTIFIC BELIEF. SOMEHOW YOU HAVE, THROUGH MAYBE YOUR WORDS.
I'LL TAKE THAT.
Jon: HIS QUESTION WAS:  CAN >>YOU LET RICHARD DAWKINS KNOW THAT THERE ARE RELIGIOUS INDIVIDUALS WITH A STRONG BELIEF IN GOD WHO BELIEVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. DOES THAT SEEM INCONGRUOUS TO YOU?
NO, I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HE SAID ASK HIM IF HE'S AWARE OF THAT AND I GO, I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S AWARE OF THAT.
IT'S A POINT I MAKE. I OFTEN JOIN FORCES WITH BISHOPS AND OTHER FRIENDS TO COMBAT THE ANTISCIENTIFIC TENDENCY OF FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGION. IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT FALLACIES OF FUNDAMENTALISTS THAT THEY THINK ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE LIKE THEM.
Jon: HERE IS MY PROPOSAL FOR THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT:  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE END OF OUR CIVILIZATION WILL BE THROUGH RELIGIOUS STRIFE OR SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE IN THE LONG-TERM BE MORE DAMAGING TO THE PROSPECTS OF THE HUMAN RACE.
THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL MARTIN REESE AND PRESIDENT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY GIVES HUMANITY A 50% CHANCE OF SURVIVING THROUGH THE 21ST CENTURY.
Jon: WAIT, HOLD ON, I HAVE TO DO SOME MATH. OH, FINE. [LAUGHTER]
AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS HE FEARS THAT THE FRUITS OF SCIENTIFIC -- THE BAD FRUITS THINGS LIKE DIRTY BOMBS, THINGS LIKE BIOLOGICAL WARFARE COULD GET INTO THE HANDS OF RELIGIOUS FANATICS WHO UNLIKE ALL OTHER TERRORISTS WANT TO DIE. THEY WANT TO GO TO PARADISE. THE QUESTION YOU ASK THE ANSWER IS BOTH THAT SCIENCE PROVIDES IN THE FORM OF TECHNOLOGY, WEAPONS WHICH HAVE ONLY BEEN AVAILABLE TO REASONABLY RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENTS WILL LIKELY BECOME AVAILABLE TO NUTCASES WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR GOD REQUIRES THEM TO WREAK HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION.
Jon: DOESN'T IT THOUGH LET SCIENTISTS OFF THE HOOK TO SOME EXTENT TO SUGGEST THAT THEIR WORK COULD ONLY BE MISUSED BY THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE BOGGLED BY TRELIGIOUS FANATICISM, WHEN INBY FACT, ISN'T THERE A STRONG PROBABILITY THAT WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN CONTROL OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES DON'T YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLY MORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL CREATE SOMETHING THAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF IT IS WORLDWIDE CATASTROPHE?
IT'S POSSIBLE. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE, I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. SCIENCE IS THE MOST POWERFUL WAY TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO. IF YOU WANT TO DO GOOD IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL WAY OF DOING GOOD AND IF YOU WANT TO DO EVIL IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL WAY.
Jon: I GUESS IT'S THE THIRD LAW FOR EVERY ACTION THERE'S AN OPPOSITE AND EQUAL REACTION. YOU SPLIT AN  ATOM AND YOU CAN LIGHT THE WORLD GOING THIS WAY. AND IF YOU GO THIS WAY YOU CAN BLOW UP THE WORLD. IT SEEMS LIKE WE TRY THIS WAY FIRST. [LAUGHTER]
THERE'S A THEORY THAT WHY WE >DON'T DETECT EXTRA TERRESTRIAL CIVILIZATIONS IT REACHES A POINT WHEN IT'S CAPABILITY OF BROADCASTING RADIO WAVES WE CAN PICK UP THERE'S ONLY A BRIEF WINDOW BEFORE IT BLOWS ITSELF UP. THERE'S A BRIEF WINDOW BETWEEN DISCOVERING THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNICATE BY RADIO AND PRODUCING THE HORRIFIC TECHNOLOGY WHICH THEN GETS OUT OF CONTROL. IT MAY BE THAT ALL OVER THE UNIVERSE THERE ARE CIVILIZATIONS WINKING INTO ACTION, BRIEFLY AND THEN KILLING THEMSELVES.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK IT ONLY TAKES THEM A FEW CENTURIES?
THAT'S JUST THE SPECULATION.
Jon: YOU FEEL LIKE WE ARE LOW ACHIEVING WHEN IT COMES TO DESTROYING OURSELVES?
NOT AT ALL. IT TAKES MANY BILLIONS OF YEARS FOR EVOLUTION TO REACH THE POINT WHERE TECHNOLOGY TAKES OFF. BUT ONCE TECHNOLOGY TAKES OFF BUT THEN IT'S AN EYE BLINK BY THE STANDARD OF GEOLOGICAL TIME. ACCORDING TO THIS PESSIMISTIC SPECULATION. ONLY --
Jon: AT THIS POINT THE ONLY SPECULATION I HEAR FROM YOU IS PESSIMISTIC. IT'S EASY TO LOOK AT THE DARK SIDE OF FUNDAMENTALISM AND THE DAMAGE IT CAN DO. SOMETIMES I THINK WE HAVE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES AND LOOK AT THE DARK SIDE OF ACHIEVEMENT. I BELIEVE THAT THE FINAL WORDS MAN UTTERS ON THIS EARTH WILL BE IT WORKED. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT WILL BE AN EXPERIMENT THAT ISN'T MISUSED BUT WILL BE A ROLLING CATASTROPHE.
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
Jon: A PRETTY GOOD POSSIBILITY.
I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT.
Jon: ABOUT SCIENCE?
YES, YES.
Jon: IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO CONTROL. CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT AND THE CAT NEVER SAW IT COMING. CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
OH, YEAH.
Jon: BEAUTIFUL. "AN APPETITE FOR WONDER" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. RICHARD DAWKINS, WE'LL CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION ON THE WEB
