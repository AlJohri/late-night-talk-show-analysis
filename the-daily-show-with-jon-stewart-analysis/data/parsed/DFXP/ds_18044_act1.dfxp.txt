FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARDS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. CBS NEWS MAN BOB SCHIEFFER HE  WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS  BUSINESS OF WHICH HE IS A PART. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO  START. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE ANYTHING IN  AN ENORMOUS FALL FROM GRACE.
ON MONDAY LANCE ARMSTRONG  ADMITTING DOPING WHILE HE WAS  WINNING THE TOUR DE FRANCE SEVEN  TIMES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I BELIEVED IN YOU  LANCE ARMSTRONG. I SHELLED OUT A DOLLAR FOR A  RUBBER BRACELET THAT I HAVE  SOMEWHERE IN MY HOUSE. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR YOU! I DID IT FOR YOU. AND WHEN I THINK OF THE FACT  THAT I SPENT A -- [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I THINK WE ALL OWE CANCER  AN APOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] OR IS THAT NOT THE LESSON IN ALL  THIS? WELL, LISTEN ARMSTRONG IS A  CHEATER BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR  AMERICA'S SECOND FAVORITE CYCLIST WHO I'M SURE IS IN THERE  CYCLIST. AMERICA'S SECOND FAVORITE  CYCLIST. LET'S CALL HIM BIKIE JOE, I  GUESS. WHO GOT HIM TO COME OUT WITH THE  TRUTH? WHAT ENTITY IS MORE POWERFUL  THAN LADY JUSTICE?
BREAKING NEWS, IT'S SAID THAT  LANCE ARMSTRONG HAS CONFESSED IN  HIS INTERVIEW WITH OPRAH OPRAH WINFREY THAT HE USED PERFORMANCE  ENHANCING DRUGS.
Jon: I DON'T READ ANY MY  GUEST BOOKS OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. MY iPOD IS ONLY BOY BANDS. WHY AM I DOING THIS? I CAN'T NOT CONFESS. NO! GODFATHER 3 IS THE BEST -- NO! I'M HYPNOTIZED BY HER LOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM (bleep) THIS SHOW UP LEFT  AND RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO TELL  YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU'RE WELCOME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I APPLAUD YOUR LACK OF  PREPARATION. [ LAUGHTER ] THE INTERVIEW DOESN'T AIR UNTIL  THURSDAY ON THE OWN NETWORK  WHICH STANDS FOR OPRAH WIN FRIDAY IS NOT ON CHANNEL 7  ANYMORE. YOU'LL FIND IT. IT'S SURPRISINGLY CANDID AND  TIMELY CONVERSATION WITH GAYLE  KING OF CBS NEWS OPRAH DESCRIBES THE INTERACTION.
I WOULD SAY THAT HE DID NOT  COME CLEAN IN THE MANNER THAT I  EXPECTED. IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME. I WOULD SAY THAT FOR MYSELF, MY  TEAM, ALL OF US IN THE ROOM, WE  WERE MESMERIZED AND RIVETTED BY SOME OF HIS ANSWERS.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING WE  SHOULD WATCH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY THAT INTERVIEW IS NOT  ON SATELLITE, OPRAH JUST APPEARS  TO GAYLE WHENEVER GAYLE GAZES INTO A REFLECTIVE SURFACE. LANCE ARMSTRONG WAS DOPING. OF COURSE HE WAS. YOU CAN BEST CANCER AND YOU CAN  WIN THE TOUR DE FRANCE BUT YOU  CAN'T BEAT THE TOUR DE FRANCE 7 TIMES AND BEAT CANCER OR VICE  VERSA MEANING YOU HAVE WON THE  TOUR DE FRANCE AND LOST SEVEN  TESTICLES. IT'S OBVIOUS IN HINDSIGHT. IT'S LIKE THE TOOTH FAIRY. OF COURSE, A WINGED FAIRY SPENDS  HER LIFE COLLECTING BABY TEETH  YET SOMEHOW HAS MONEY IN HER POCKET TO GIVE OUT. DEFIES CREDIBILITY. ANY IDIOT WITH HALF A BRAIN  SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE  ARMSTRONG OF LYING. THEY'VE BEEN TESTING ME LIKE  CRAZY. THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU. DON'T THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR  THEMSELVES AT A CERTAIN POINT?
Jon: HELLO! HELLO. [ LAUGHTER ] NAILED IT AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? FOR AS GOOD AS INTERVIEWING AS I  AM, I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF  ARMSTRONG WAS ALSO BANGING DAVID  PATREAUS. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKING AT HOW THE TWO OF US  HAVE AGED SINCE THAT INTERVIEW,  I NEED TO START DOPING. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ARMSTRONG ADMITS DOPING. IT'S A LONG ROAD BACK TO  REDEMPTION. HOW CAN HE FIND HIMSELF BACK TO  AMERICA'S GOOD GRACES.
HE HAS INDICATED A  WILLINGNESS TO TESTIFY AGAINST  OTHERS.
Jon: GOOD, AMERICA DOESN'T  LIKE LIARS BUT THEY LOVE A SIX  IN FOR MORE ON THE STORY WERE JOINED BY ASIVE MANDVI IN OUR --  ASSIF MANDVI IN OUR REGULAR  SEGMENT PAGING DR. MANDVI.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: FROM A MEDICAL  STANDPOINT HOW REMARKABLE IS  ARMSTRONG'S ACCOMPLISHMENT? GREAT QUESTION, JON. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING  HOW DID LANCE ARMSTRONG MAINTAIN  A WEB OF LIES FOR OVER 13 YEARS, JUST ONE MORE TRIBUTE TO THIS  INCREDIBLE ENDURANCE ATHLETE  WHEN THE AVERAGE MAN CAN ONLY SUSTAIN A SINGLE LIE FOR BETWEEN  FIVE AND SEVEN HOURS BEFORE  GUILT AND LACK OF OXYGEN. GOO ON MY SHIRT. I WAS DOING AN ART PROJECT WITH  CHILDREN. OKAY IT'S STRIPPER GLITTER!
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING IT'S  PREPARATION.
AND TRAINING. THIS IS PRACTICING RUNNING FROM  THE TRUTH AT THE PRESTIGIOUS  DICK NIXON HUMAN DEEXCEPTION LAB IN WASHINGTON, D.C. EVEN THEN RESEARCHERS RECOGNIZED  HIS GREATNESS.
Jon: PHYSIOLOGY HAS TO PLAY  SOME ROLE IN THIS. NOT JUST THE TRAINING. WE COULD TRAIN FOR YEARS AND  NEVER APPROACH THAT TYPE OF  ENDURANCE.
CERTAINLY HIS INHERENT  UNETHICAL ABILITY GIVES HIM --
HERE SAY NORMAL HUMAN BRAIN. YOU CAN SEE THE CENTER THAT  CONTROLS DECEPTION IS THIS WHITE  MATTER RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN SEE IT'S THE SIZE OF A  WALNUT OR FOUR WARM ALMONDS OR  ONE AND A HALF BRAZIL NUTS. I FLEW IN ON FIRST CLASS.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THEY GIVE  YOU A RAMEKIN OF NUTS AND THEY  ARE WARM.
DELICIOUS.
Jon: THAT'S A NORMAL ONE.
IF YOU LOOK AT ARMSTRONG'S  IT'S LOOKS LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] SEE LIKE -- [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WE GO. AND. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: TWO TO THREE INCHES OF  WHIPPED CREAM COVERING THE  ENTIRETY OF HIS BRAIN.
THAT'S RIGHT THERE.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR  ARE YOU?
I'M AN INDIAN DOCTOR, JON. THIS IS MY MEDICAL DEGREE RIGHT  HERE. WE JUST KNOW THIS STUFF, OKAY?
Jon: SO, OKAY, SO THIS  EXPLAINS WHY WHY HE IS CAPABLE  OF TELLING BIGGER LIES FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.
TO SOME EXTENT. HE WAS BORN WITH GENETIC  ADVANTAGES. HE CERTAINLY WORKED HARD AT -- [ LAUGHTER ] HE HAS WORKED HARD AT BEING THE  BEST LIAR YOU CAN BE BUT EVEN  THAT DOESN'T COMPLETELY EXPLAIN HIS SUCCESS.
Jon: WHO. ARE YOU SAYING WHAT I THINK YOU  ARE SAYING?
I THINK I'M SAYING WHAT YOU  THINK I'M SAYING.
Jon: I THINK YOU THINK I  KNOW THINK WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. SAY IT.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL SAY IT. I BELIEVE HE HAS BEEN USING LIE  ENHANCING DRUGS. YOU NAME IT, HE'S ON IT. FIB-ADR E, DEDECEPT-A FRIEND. NONSENSE CALL, THE GENERIC OF  FRAUD-U-LEX. GUILT IS SAY SIDE EFFECT OF THE  DRUGS AND ANY ONE OF THESE  DOCTORS WILL MASK WIT A 100 MILLIGRAMSES OF  DOUCH
