Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, IN 1996, THEN-PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED INTO LAW THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT OR NAMBLA... DOMBLA, WHATEVER. IT STIMULATED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD ONLY LEGALLYAGE KNOWLEDGE MARRIAGES BETWEEN ONE  MAN AND ONE WOMAN. IT WAS ONE OF HIS ADMINISTRATION'S PROUDEST MOMENT, WHICH IS WHY HE  SIGNINGED IT AT 12:50 A.M. ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. THAT'S BILL CLINTON FOR YOU, STAYING UP LATE IN THE OVAL OFFICE DEFENDING MARRIAGE. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] BUT I THANK GOD HE DID. I THANK GOD THAT HE DID, BECAUSE SINCE THEN THE LINES AROUND ONE MAN-ONE WOMAN MARRIAGE HAVE  BECOME BLURRIER, SOMETHING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND MOTIVATIONAL FOOD COURT SPEAKER  RICK SANTORUM KNOWS ALL TOO WELL.
MARRIAGE EXISTED BEFORE GOVERNMENT EXISTED. I CAN CALL THIS NAPKIN A PAPER TOWEL, BUT IT IS NAPKIN. WHY? BECAUSE IT IS WHAT IT IS. RIGHT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AND WHILE NAPKINS AND PAPER TOWELS ARE NOUNS, IMMUTABLE OBJECTS AND MARRIAGE IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOCIAL  CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN REDEFINED BY MANY DIFFERENT SOCIETIES THROUGHOUT THE AGE, ORIGINALLY  BEING A PROPERTY AGREEMENT, HIS POINT IS WELL TAKEN. IT'S THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT. IF PEOPLE START USING PAPER TOWELS AS NAPKINS, WHAT'S NEXT? SLEEVES, DRAPES, MOUTH-ON-DOG WIPING? [LAUGHTER] MORAL CHAOS! YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY, THAT NAPKIN NAIL JOY WAS STUPID -- ANALOGY WAS STUPID. GIVE ME A DIFFERENT ONE.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, HANGING UP THIS AND SAYING THIS GLASS OF  WATER IS A GLASS OF BEER. WELL, YOU CAN CALL IT A GLASS OF BEER, BUT IT'S NOT A GLASS OF  BEER, IT'S A GLASS OF WATER, AND WATER IS WHAT WATER IS.
Jon: YES, SENATOR. AS A CHRISTIAN YOU WANT TO BASE YOUR ARGUMENT AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE ON THE IDEA THAT WATER  COULD NEVER BE TURNED INTO AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] VERY SMART. VERY SMART. BUT NOT THE POINT. ONCE AGAIN THE AUDIENCE HAS CLEARLY MISSED THE POINT. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS DOMA, DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT, IS ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN US AND THE INABILITY TO  DISTINGUISH BETWEEN BEER AND WATER.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ORDERED THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO STOP DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY  OF THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW SAME-SEX MARRIAGES SHOULD BE  TREATED JUST LIKE TRADITIONAL ONES.
Jon: WHAT? NO! THAT WOULD MEAN THAT AS OF NOW MARRIAGE IS COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS AND OPEN TO ATTACKS  FROM ALL KINDS OF MISCHIEF, SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
THESE ARE PICTURES OF ANTHONY MACK AND HIS HUSBAND BRADFORD WELLS GETTING MARRIED SEVEN  YEARS AGO IN MASSACHUSETTS. BUT ANTHONY, WHO YOU SEE THERE ON THE RIGHT IN THESE PICTURES, FACES DEPORTATION BACK TO HIS NATIVE AUSTRALIA. BRADFORD SUFFERS FROM ADVANCED AIDS. IF HIS HUSBAND IS DEPORTED, HE LOSES HIS CAREGIVER, THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN HIS LIFESAVER.
Jon: THIS INSIDIOUS PROCESS OF ANCHOR NURSING MUST BE STOPPED. [LAUGHTER] BUT WAIT A SECOND. I THOUGHT OBAMA SAID HE WASN'T DEFENDING THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ANYMORE. SO WHY DOES THIS MAN HAVE TO LEAVE HIS LEGALLY MARRIED HUSBAND?
U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES TOLD CNN AFFILIATE KDVU PURSUANT TO THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL'S GUIDANCE, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT REMAINS IN EFFECT AND THE EXECUTIVE  BRANCH, INCLUDING DHS, WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE IT.
Jon: OH, THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, THE ADMINISTRATION WON'T DEFEND THE    Captioning sponsored by    INDEFENSIBLE. THEY WILL, HOWEVER, ENFORCE THE INDEFENSIBLE. WHY? DRACONIAN, CRUEL, LACKING IN BASIC HUMANITY AND COMPASSION? YES, BUT REMEMBER, THE GAYS WIN THIS ONE, WHO IS TO SAY WHAT OUR CHILDREN WILL BE WIPING THEIR  FACES WITH. TOMORROW. THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
