WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST STARS IN CBS'S "THE BIG BANG THEORY" ALSO STARRING IN HBO'S UPCOMING FILM "THE NORMAL HEART."
WE CAN'T TELL PEOPLE HOW TO LIVE THEIR LIVES, NED. THE ENTIRE GAY POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS (BLEEP).
HI.
HI.
YOU KNOW, I'M VERY INTERESTED IN SETTING UP SOME SORT OF SERVICES FOR THE PATIENTS. WE'VE GOT TO START TALKING ABOUT THEM. ALSO, THERE ARE A LOT OF VERY SCARED PEOPLE OUT THERE AND THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR INFORMATION. I'D TO START A HOTLINE.
WHO'S HE? OOH, HE DOES NOT KNOW WHO I AM YET. HIS NAME IS TOMMY BOATWRIGHT. IN REAL LIFE HE IS A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR. HE'S HERE TO HELP AND HE'S A SOUTHERN BITCH.
MR. BOATRIGHT. BRUCE NILES.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
MY PLEASURE.
YOU'RE VERY HANDSOME.
HE KNOWS.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JIM PARSONS! (MUSIC) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOUNG MAN. TO YOU, SIR. WELCOME.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: FIRST, BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE FILM, I WANT TO BREAK SOME EXCITING NEWS.
OH GOD. WHAT?
Jon: "BIG BANG THEORY" HAS BEEN PICKED UP UNTIL 2050. 2050! 36 MORE YEARS.
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE PLAYING MY PART BY THEN BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT GOES ON HAPPILY.
Jon: YOUR BRAIN IN A JAR WILL BE PLAYING YOUR PART.
OH, MY GOD, YES, I HOPE MY OFFSPRING THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN GET RESIDUALS FROM ME.
Jon: OH STOP. CONGRATULATIONS THOUGH.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THIS FILM, THIS FILM IS VERY QUICKLY SOMETHING LARRY KRAMER PUT TOGETHER IN 80 -- WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
I BELIEVE THE STAGE PLAY OF IT WAS FIRST DONE IN '84, '85. IT WAS REALLY -- IT WAS SO GOING ON RIGHT THEN, WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE MOVIE, THE STAGE PLAY ACTUALLY HAD THE SET WAS LIKE THESE WHITE WALLS WHERE THEY ADDED THE NAMES OF THE DYING AS THEY WERE DYING.
Jon: RIGHT. THIS WAS THE EARLY PART OF THE TERRIBLE AIDS CRISIS.
THE AIDS CRISIS. YES. RIGHT.
Jon: BEFORE EVEN REAGAN I THINK HAD EVER MENTIONED IT PUBLICLY, LARRY KRAMER HAD ALREADY WRITTEN THIS BRILLIANT PLAY.
YES. YES. AND SO EVERYTHING WAS STILL OBVIOUSLY SHUFFLING AROUND FIGURING OUT, THE EMERGENCY WAS IN ITS GREATEST THROES AT THAT MOMENT. NOW HERE WE ARE 30 YEARS LATER AND IT'S, IN SOME WAYS, ALL THE MORE, TO ME, POWERFUL AND INTERESTING TO SEE THIS STORY NOW. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT ON. YOU KNOW, MYSELF INCLUDED. AND EVEN IF YOU KNOW INTELLECTUALLY, TO SEE IT PERSONIFIED IN THIS WAY, YOU LEARN IT IN A WAY IN YOUR HEART THAT YOU DIDN'T. YOU KNOW. IT IS SAD BUT IT'S WONDERFUL. IT'S WONDERFUL. YOU FEEL -- WHEN I SEE IT, I FEEL SOMEWHAT SAD WHEN IT'S OVER, BUT YOU FEEL -- I DON'T KNOW, A CERTAIN PEACE, TOO, AND A CONNECTION TO HUMANITY, IF THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIDICULOUS TO YOU.
Jon: NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THOUGH?
Jon: WE HAVE FEELINGS.
I KNOW YOU DO. YOU'RE A VERY WARM, SENSITIVE MAN.
Jon: BUT THE URGENCY, THE URGENCY IS WHAT'S SO INTERESTING TO ME.
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE THE PLAY CAPTURES THAT CONFUSION OF THAT TIME AND THE URGENCY OF ACTION.
UTTER CONFUSION. WELL, EXACTLY. AND THE THING WE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT WHEN I WAS DOING THE STAGE PLAY WITH GEORGE WOLFE, WHEN I DID THE MOVIE WITH RYAN MURPHY, EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT, IT'S A REAL, LIVE HORROR FILM. THERE IS LITERALLY A KILLER ON THE LOOSE, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM, WE DON'T WHAT IT IS AND EVERYONE IS RUNNING AS FAST AS THEY CAN. ONE OF THE FUN THINGS ABOUT DOING IT WAS -- (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, GO ON.
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. (LAUGHTER) YEAH, I FOUND THE HUMOR IN THE NORMAL HEART. BUT SERIOUSLY, IT WAS GOING THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS AND TRYING TO -- I HAD TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF, NO E-MAILS, NO CELL PHONES, NO INTERNET, AND IT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS UNTIL YOU'RE IN THOSE SCENES WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE, WARN PEOPLE, GET PEOPLE TO A HOSPITAL, AND YOU REALIZE HOW FEW THINGS IN COMPARISON WE HAD. TIMES HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH. SO QUICKLY.
Jon: SO MUCH OF IT WAS ABOUT INFORMATION.
ABSOLUTELY.
AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION AND FINDING IT. AND I FIND MYSELF THIS WAY WITH MY KIDS. THEY'LL SAY SOMETHING LIKE, ARE THERE PIGMY GOATS? AND I WILL HAVE TO SAY, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LOOK IT UP? BUT IN THE OLD DAYS I WOULD HAVE WENT, I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
YEAH. COMPLETELY.  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LIKE YOU JUST WOULD, THAT'D BE IT? LIKE YOU JUST, I DON'T KNOW!
NO.
LET'S DO SOMETHING ELSE.
I MEAN, WHEN YOU, WHEN BOTH OF US, I'M SURE, WENT THROUGH SCHOOL, IT WAS TRIPS TO THE LIBRARY.
Jon: SURE. YEP.
THAT'S HOW YOU FOUND EVERYTHING. YOU CHECKED OUT REALLY HEAVY BOOKS AND WROTE REALLY BAD PAPERS, YOU KNOW.
Jon: AND WE DID THEM ON, DID YOU DO THEM, WELL, I'M OLDER THAN YOU, BUT WE USED TO DO THEM ON THE TYPE WRITER AND WHEN YOU MADE A MISTAKE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK WITH THE WHITEOUT AND TYPE IT AGAIN.
I TRANSITIONED TO A WORD PROCESSOR BEFORE I FINISHED WITH SCHOOL, SO I DIDN'T, I DIDN'T, BUT I DID IT WHILE I, THERE WERE WHITEOUT SHEETS YOU COULD DO.
Jon: EXACTLY, AND I WOULD WORK ON MY ABACUS. AGAIN, I'M OLDER THEN YOU.
I KNOW, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT. THOSE WERE GONE WHEN I WAS --
Jon: I WANTED TO ASK YOU, THOUGH, BECAUSE DOING A PIECE LIKE THIS FOR THE STAGE IS SUCH A DIFFERENT
YEAH.
Jon: PERFORMANCE THAN DOING SOMETHING THAT IS BEING FILMED FOR TELEVISION, HAVING DONE IT AS A PLAY, DID YOU HAVE TO RECALIBRATE? WHAT WAS,
TO A DEGREE --
Jon: WHAT'S THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO TRANSLATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
WELL, THE HARDEST THING WAS A VERY KIND OF SILLY-SOUNDING THING, BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER GUY WHO WAS IN THE PLAY WITH ME, YOU KNOW, JOE MANTELLO, AND HE ACTUALLY CHANGED PARTS FOR THE MOVIE.
Jon: YOU'RE IN THE SAME PART.
I AM IN THE SAME PART. BUT SO MUCH OF THE SCRIPT WAS THE SAME, THAT IT WAS HARD TO GET USE TO HEARING PEOPLE WITH NEW VOICES WITH LINES THAT'D YOU'D HEARD SAID OVER AND OVER. BUT IT WAS BEING DONE SO WELL THAT THAT QUICKLY WENT AWAY. WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING, THOUGH, WAS, YOU KNOW, LIKE HERE WE ARE NOW, AND EVERY TIME THEY LAUGH, YOU FEEL IT AND IT AFFECTS THINGS. IN THIS CASE, IT WAS OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A DRAMA, BUT THEY WERE SO MOVED -- I GUESS PARTLY BECAUSE WE WERE PERFORMING -- IT WAS A POWERFUL PIECE BUT PARTLY BECAUSE WE WERE PERFORMING AT GROUND ZERO FOR ALL THE CATASTROPHY WE WERE IN NEW YORK.
Jon: RIGHT.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD CRYING LIKE THIS. SO THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO KNOW AS WE WERE MAKING THIS MOVIE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE POWERFUL EFFECT THAT THIS COULD DEFINITELY HAVE WHEN PEOPLE SAW IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
NORMALLY, I DON'T WORK ON SOMETHING WHERE YOU KIND OF HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THAT AND FEEL THAT AND CARRY IT WITH YOU INTO THE PROJECT.
Jon: YOU FELT ITS ABSENCE AS YOU --
NO, I FELT LIKE I KNOW WHAT WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS.
Jon: OKAY.
I FELT LIKE, IF WE TELL THIS STORY CORRECTLY, THIS IS A DEVASTATING LITTLE TALE.
Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
I WISH I COULD SAY SOMETHING FUNNY HERE.
Jon: NOT AT ALL. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WERE ABLE TO IMPART ALSO TO THE OTHER ACTORS WHO MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH ITS IMPACT IN THAT WAY?
I DIDN'T HAVE TO. NOBODY ASKED ME TO. YOU KNOW WHAT, RYAN, RYAN IS A WONDERFUL DIRECTOR, MURPHY, AND HE WOULD ASK A COUPLE OF TIMES OF ME AND JOE, WHO HAD DONE IT, WHEN YOU DID THE PLAY, WHAT HAPPENED HERE, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. BUT IT WAS MORE OF THAT. EVERYBODY WAS, EVERYBODY WAS, IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM WHY THEY JOINED UP, LIKE MARK RUFFALO, AND TAYLOR KITSCH, AND MATT BONER, YOU KNOW, THEY KNEW WHY THEY WERE THERE.
Jon: YOU ALWAYS DO TERRIFIC WORK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: "THE NORMAL HEART" APPEARS MAY 25.
MAY 25TH.
Jon: IT'S RYAN MURPHY OF "GLEE" SO THERE'S A LOT OF SONGS IN IT. IT'S VERY -- (LAUGHTER)  9:00 P.M., THE GREAT JIM PARSONS. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
