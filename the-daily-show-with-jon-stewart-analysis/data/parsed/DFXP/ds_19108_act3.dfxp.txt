(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS THE FIRST CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, A POST HE HELD FROM 2009 TO 2012. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "INNOVATIVE STATE:  HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN TRANSFORM GOVERNMENT." PLEASE WELCOME ANEESH CHOPRA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. EXCITING!
Jon: INDIAN CLOONEY! WAS I WRONG? NO, "INNOVATIVE STATE:  HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN TRANSFORM GOVERNMENT" I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE WHY HAVEN'T THEY? WHAT'S TAKING NEW TECHNOLOGY SO LONG? IS GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY IMMUNE TO SOME EXTENT?
WELL, LET'S PUT OURSELVES IN SOME HISTORICAL CONTEXT, JON.
Jon: YOU AND I?
YES, SIR!
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU LOOK BACK THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE'VE HAD LONG PERIODS WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY LED THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGIES. IN FACT, ONE OF THE FOUNDING TECHNOLOGIES FOR I.B.M. HAD ITS ORIGINS IN A CENSUS GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE. AND YOU SEE THAT --
Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
YES, SIR, DID YOU KNOW THAT? THE 1870 CENSUS.
Jon: SURE, I KNEW THAT.
YES, SIR.
Jon: SO WHY DID IT FALL BEHIND?
IF YOU TAKE THE LONG VIEW, WE HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE, IT'S THE LAST 20 YEARS WHERE THE PACE OF INNOVATION AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR, CLOUD COMPUTING, BIG DATA, MOBILE BROADBAND, THESE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN HARDER TO INGEST INTO THE GOVERNMENT LARGELY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A DIFFICULT PROCESS TO BRINGING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN. WE WALKED INTO THE DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, I STILL HAD MY OLD INTERNET EXPLORER 6 ON THE COMPUTER.
Jon: YOU WERE USING 6! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
WE HAVE TO BRING NEW TECHNOLOGY IN. IT WAS THE BUGGY VERSION.
Jon: IN THE THREE YEARS YOU WERE THERE, IT'S HARD TO RECONCILE, I THINK, FOR ME, AS ADVANCED AS THE THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN WAS WITH THEIR TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF GETTING REELECTED, WHY THEY HAD SO MUCH DIFFICULTY. LET'S USE THE V.A. AS AN EXAMPLE.
SURE.
Jon: THEY'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT THE SYSTEM THERE IS ANTIQUATED. WE CLEARLY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO UPDATE IT AND MAKE IT WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. WHY HAVEN'T WE BEEN ABLE TO? CLEARLY, THEY THREW A LOT OF RESOURCES AT healthcare.gov ONCE THEY REALIZED THAT WAS WONKY. WHY CAN'T THEY THROW EVERYTHING AT THE V.A.?
LET ME BEGIN WITH SOME PERSONAL CONTEXT. I WAS IN THE CABINET IN VIRGINIA BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO COME TO WASHINGTON.
Jon: OKAY.
I HAD A COLLEAGUE IN THE CABINET WHOSE SON HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY A MISSILE IN BAGHDAD AND SHE SHARED WITH ME THE CHALLENGES AS HER SON CAME BACK TO HEALTH OF THE RECORDS SHE HAD ON PAPER AND HIS FAMILY HAD TO TRUCK AROUND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. SO WE CAME IN AND MADE IT A CLEAR PRIORITY TO DIGITIZE AND OPEN UP SOME OF THOSE RECORDS. SO NOW, TODAY, OVER A MILLION VETERANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DOWNLOAD SAFELY AND SECURELY ELECTRONIC COPIES OF THE SAME RECORDS. SO WE'VE MODERNIZED A NUMBER OF THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE.
Jon: 90% OF THESE GUYS ARE STILL WORKING ON PAPER RECORDS.
ACTUALLY, THE CLAIMS BACKLOG WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT QUITE A BIT.
Jon: DOWN TO 300,000.
WE ACTUALLY HAD A CENTER IN VIRGINIA WHERE THE FIRE MARSHAL HAD TO BADICALLY DECLARE THE BUILDING LIKE UNINHABITABLE BECAUSE OF THE PAPER. WE NOW HAVE THOSE CENTERS SCANNED OUT, ELECTRONIC FORMS HAVE COME IN AND THE BACKLOG IS DOWN 50% BECAUSE WE'VE PUT IN A LOT OF FOCUS AND ATTENTION. WHEN WE LEARN OF PROBLEMS -- PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THE THEM AND FIX THEM.
Jon: RIGHT. HERE'S THE THING... (LAUGHTER) WE KNEW THE PROBLEMS GOING IN IN 2007, AND IT'S 2014. AND IT'S HARD TO -- AND, LISTEN --
I HEAR YOU.
Jon: -- IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ON THE GOOD-HEARTED PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRIED TO WORK TO FIX IT, BUT IT IS HARD TO SWALLOW THE IDEA THAT, HEY, WE'VE CUT IT 50% IN SEVEN YEARS, YOU KNOW. I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, IS THERE SOMETHING WITHIN THE PROCESS? YOU'RE A GUY WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS TECHNOLOGY.
YES.
Jon: MY GUESS IS YOU COULD DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED FAR MORE CHEAPLY THAN THE BILLION DOLLARS THEY SPENT TO CREATE THE TWO PROGRAMS AT D.O.D. AND V.A. THAT DON'T EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER, YOU COULD DO IT FOR MUCH LESS AND MUCH FASTER. WHY CAN'T THEY?
LET ME BE CAREFUL. IN THE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WRIT LARGE THE ABILITY FOR TWO NON-CONNECTED SYSTEMS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER IS STILL  A PROBLEM. BECAUSE THE DATABASES WHEN THEY WERE BUILT JUST FOR THEIR PRIMARY USE, THE ABILITY TO TAKE INFORMATION AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS WAS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL DESIGN. SO AFTER THE FACT, IF YOU TRY TO STITCH THESE THINGS TOGETHER, YOU DON'T WANT TO INTRODUCE ERROR. YOU DON'T WANT TO STITCH THEM TOGETHER BY BRUTE FORCE AND SAY, HEY, IS THIS WORKING AND RUN THE RISK YOU HAVE THE WRONG MEDICATION FOR THE PATIENT AND ISSUED THE WRONG DOSE. THAT'S INTRODUCING HARM. SO, THE REASON WHY I SAID EMPOWER THEM DIRECTLY, THE SYSTEMS WHO HAVE THE DATA CAN GIVE IT TO YOU.
Jon: WHO'S GOT THE DATA?
EACH INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM, THE DoD HAS ITS DATA, THE V.A. HAS ITS DATA. IN THE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THEY HAVE THEIR DATA. I HEAR YOU. YOU DON'T WANT THE VETERAN OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE WORK.
Jon: THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT.
IT IS SAFE, SECURE, AND THEIR FAMILIES -- I WOULD RATHER MY COLLEAGUE --
Jon: YOU WOULD RECOMMEND NOT HAVING A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM?
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. LOTS OF MONEY. THEY'RE GOING TO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS.
Jon: WHY IS THAT? I GUESS, THAT'S MY POINT. WHY IS THAT GOING TO TAKE SO LONG?
YOU HAVE A LEGACY DATABASE YOU WILL HAVE TO MODERNIZE. MANY OF THESE INITIAL SYSTEMS WEREN'T BUILT WITH THESE MODERN  APPROCHES. NOT A GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, EVERY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES, PUBLIC SECTOR, PRIVATE SECTOR. SO, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS EMPOWER PEOPLE TO LIVE BETTER LIVES AND ALLOW THEM TO LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE BETTER THAN AN INDIAN CLOONEY. YOU'RE BETTER THAN CLOONEY! INNOVATIVE STATE IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. OBVIOUSLY, THE INTERVIEW THAT WE DID IS VERY LONG. SO YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONLY SEEN A FEW MINUTES OF IT AND ARE THINKING, THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER. IF YOU GO TO THE WEB, NOW -- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE WEB?
I THINK SO. AN INNOVATION FROM GOVERNMENT, I MIGHT ADD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT IS TRUE, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. "INNOVATIVE STATE:  HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN TRANSFORM GOVERNMENT." GO TO THE WEB! ANEESH CHOPRA!
