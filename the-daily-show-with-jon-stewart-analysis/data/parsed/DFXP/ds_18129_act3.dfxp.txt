[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A VERY FUNNY  COMEDIAN AND ACTOR WHO STARS AND  HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR A BUNCH OF EMMYS. HIS NEW MOVIE IS CALLED BLUE  JASMINE.
I'M EASY GOING BY NATURE. THAT'S WHAT I BRING MUSIC TO  PEOPLE'S LIVES.
YOU'RE VERY SWEET, YOU KNOW. I NEVER HAD A SWEET GUY BEFORE.
I HOPE I DIDN'T GET YOU IN  TROUBLE WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.
NO. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE  ENGAGED. SO, YOU KNOW, I'M FREE. I'M FREE.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. LUNCH HOUR IS ALMOST OVER. WE HAVE TIME THOUGH. FOR WHAT? LET'S GO IN THE BACK SEAT. AGAIN? YEAH, COME ON. John: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW THE BRILLIANT ACTOR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: THAT'S REALLY RUDE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. John: CONGRATULATIONS ON THE  ROYAL BABY.
YES. I WASN'T GOING TO SAY BUT THAT'S  MY KID, YEAH. IT IS. IT'S MY KID. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY... YOU  SEE, I DON'T... I DON'T  UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S A BIG DEAL. I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS WHAT 50 BABIES BORN IN  BROOKLYN TODAY PROBABLY.
John: BUT NONE OF THEM ARE  GOING TO BE THE GREATEST BABY IN  THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
NO. THIS BABY IS BORN WITH A CASTLE  ALREADY.
John: THAT'S RIGHT. WITH A COUPLE OF CASTLES. John: PEOPLE IN BROOKLYN JUST  HAVE A FEW WHITE CASTLES THEY  CAN GO AND EAT. THAT'S SUBJECTIVELY LESS GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD. John: BLUE JASMINE A WOODY  ALLEN MOVIE.
RIGHT, RIGHT. John: AS A COMEDIAN, THAT  MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY AMAZING TO  SPEND ANY TIME AMOUNT OF TIME.
ALL I WANTED TO DO IS MEET  HIM BEFORE HE DIED. THAT WAS MY GOAL. I MEAN, ANYBODY, NOT BECAUSE  HE'S OLD BUT ANYBODY. IF HE GETS HIT BY A TRUCK AS  EASILY AS DIE OF OLD AGE.
John: WOODY, I'M SO GLAD YOU  DIDN'T DIE BEFORE...
I SAID NICE TO MEET YOU. THEN I WAS LIKE DONE, DID IT. GO AHEAD.
John: NOW YOU CAN CORK IT. ENJOY YOURSELF. John: AS A KID, THE NIGHTCLUB  ALBUM OFF BY HEART.
WOODY WAS A HERO OF MINE AND  ONE OF THE BEST EVER SO I REALLY  JUST WANTED TO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH HIM.
John: IN THE PRESS FOR THIS  MOVIE HE STARTED TO SAY THAT HE  MIGHT DO A LITTLE STAND-UP  AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT I HER, YEAH. John: NUDGE HIM. I'LL PROBABLY NEVER SEE HIM  AGAIN. I WAS IN THE MOVIE FOR THREE  DAYS. THE WAY I LOOKED AT IT THEY WERE  MAKING A MOVIE AND I GOT TO BE  IN IT. I'M THIS GUY WHO BOTHERS THIS  POOR WOMAN PLAYED BY SALLY  HAWKINS. I, YOU KNOW, I AFFECTED HER  ABOUT FIVE TIMES IN THE MOVIE IN  THE CAR AND IN A CLOSET. I'M REALLY SEEDY. JUST GROSS.
John: I LOVE THE WAY YOU  DESCRIBED YOUR CHARACTER AS ONE  OF THOSE STORIES THAT WOMEN CARRY AROUND.
YEAH. YEAH. I'M ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT  HAPPENED TO SOME POOR LADY. THAT'S WHAT I PLAY IN THIS  MOVIE.
John: I FEEL LIKE AT SOME  POINT IN OUR LIVES WE HAVE ALL  BEEN THAT STORY TO A WOMAN. WE JUST HAVE TO OWN THAT FOR THE  REST OF OUR LIVES.
I DON'T THINK MOST GUYS  REALIZE THAT ALL WOMEN HAVE  HORRIBLE STORIES. I MEAN, WE HAVE STORIES THAT ARE  LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT. BUT THEY HAVE STORIES LIKE, I  CAN'T EVEN TELL THE POLICE THAT  HAPPENED. BECAUSE IT'S SO EMBARRASSING. I GREW UP WITH THREE SISTERS. THAT'S WHAT EVERY... YOU KNOW,  THEY ALL HAVE THAT... THEY CARRY  THAT AROUND.
John: THAT IS WHAT IS  BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS MOVIE. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THIS  MOVIE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT. John: IT'S GREAT. THIS IS USUALLY HOW THIS PART OF  THE MOVIE INTERVIEWS GO. WHAT'S IT LIKE? GOOD.
NO, THE PREMIERE IS TONIGHT  SO I WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL  TONIGHT TO SEE IT. BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND MOST  OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE ARE  LYING ABOUT SOMETHING. I CAN PLAY LIARS WELL BECAUSE I  UNDERSTAND. YOU LIE BECAUSE LIFE IS NOT THAT  GREAT. SO BY LYING YOU GET TO ADD  DIMENSIONS TO YOUR LIFE THAT  DON'T REALLY EXIST. THAT'S WHAT I PLAY. I DON'T WANT TO TELL ABOUT IT.
John: HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN [BLEEP] SEEN  IT. YOU'RE JUST GUESSING AT THIS  POINT. ALSO ANDREW DICE CLAY IS IN THIS  MOVIE.
I TRIED OUT FOR HIS PART  ORIGINALLY.
John: YOU DID? I DID. MY AUDITION WAS FOR THE PART HE  ENDED UP DOING. HE'S GREAT. HE'S A REALLY GOOD ACTOR.
John: HE'S BRILLIANT IN THIS. I GUESS. I URGE EVERYBODY TO SEE IT. I HEARD IT'S REALLY GREAT.
John: A QUICK FINAL QUESTION  FOR YOU. ROLLING STONE HAS CALLED YOU THE  FUNNIEST COMEDIAN IN AMERICA AND  A JERK-OFF GENIUS. WHICH TITLE WOULD YOU LIKE ON  YOUR HEAD STONE.
THEY PUT THAT KID ON THE  COVER THAT BLEW UP BOSTON SO [BLEEP] THEM. I DON'T CARE.
John: BLUE JASMINE WILL OPEN  IN SELECT CITIES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
