(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS IN THE WAKE OF THE SHOOTINGS IN ARIZONA  THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO RESTORE CIVIL AND  HONEST DISCOURSE TO POLITICS AND I THOUGHT ONE LAWMAKER IN PARTICULAR MADE AN ESPECIALLY  ELOQUENT CASE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR LAST WEDNESDAY.
WE'RE ALL AMERICANS. WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. AND WE ALL HAVE SIMILAR GOALS AND SIMILAR ASPIRATIONS. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY DIFFER ON PHILOSOPHY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE US COMMUNISTS OR SOCIALISTS OR  BIRTHERS OR WHATEVER.
Jon: HEAR, HEAR! DEMOCRAT STEVE COHEN OF TENNESSEE SPEAKING NOT A MINUTE TOO SOON. EVEN AS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS JUST ABOUT TO TAKE UP THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE  OF HEALTH CARE REFORM. LET'S LISTEN TO STEVE COHEN OF TENNESSEE ON THAT ISSUE.
THEY SAY IT'S A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE. A BIG LIE, JUST LIKE GOEBBELS. YOU SAY IT ENOUGH, YOU REPEAT THE LIE, YOU REPEAT, THE LIE, YOU REPEAT THE LIE AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE BELIEVE IT. THE GERMANS SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THE JEWS AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED IT AND YOU HAD THE HOLOCAUST. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME TO THE GENTLE NAZI FROM COLORADO. (LAUGHTER) DUDE, IT ONLY TOOK YOU A WEEK TO FORGET EVERYTHING... GIVEN TIME  TO REFLECT, I'M SURE COHEN REALIZED COMPARING REPUBLICANS TO NAZIS IS THE POLAR OPPOSITE  OF THE THINS HE WAS SAYING LAST WEEK AND THAT SHE SHOULDN'T SAY  IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S WRONG.
I WON'T SAY IT AGAIN, BUT I WAS RIGHT.
Jon: WHAT? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) SON OF A BITCH! YOU MAY BE RIGHT, YOU MAY HAVE A POINT, MAYBE REPUBLICANS ARE LYING ABOUT HEALTH CARE REFORM, BUT IF YOUR POINT IS TO SAY THAT THEY'RE LYING, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO NAZI ON THEM? YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALREADY A PERFECTLY GOOD WORD FOR LIARS. LIARS. (LAUGHTER) LYING DOESN'T MAKE YOU A NAZI. LYING ISN'T EVEN WHAT MADE THE NAZIS NAZIS. (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE AT AUSCHWITZ WEREN'T UPSET BECAUSE THEY WERE LIED TO. (LAUGHTER) "YOU SAID THERE'D BE A POOL!" (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS, BUT SHARING ONE ATTRIBUTE WITH NAZIS DOESN'T  MAKE YOU ONE. THE NAZIS MARCHED WITH GREAT PRECISION. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THESE PEOPLE ARE NAZIS. (LAUGHTER) THE NAZIS WERE NOTORIOUS FOR BROWN SHIRTS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE THIS GUY A NAZI. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) WHAT IT MAKES HIM IS A MAN WHO BRINGS ME DELICIOUS STEAKS ALL  THE WAY FROM OMAHA OVERNIGHT WHICH, I PROMISE YOU, NO NAZI WOULD DO. (LAUGHTER) AND WHILE, YES, HITLER WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS LITTLE MUSTACHE  AND JAUNTY RIGHT-HANDED SALUTE, THAT DOESN'T MAKE THIS BABY REACHING FOR STRAWBERRY JAM HITLER! IT DOES NOT! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) ALTHOUGH... ALTHOUGH WHO CAN BE SURE? (LAUGHTER) AND IF COHEN IS RIGHT AND REPEATING A LIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN MAKES YOU A NAZI, WHAT ARE  THESE PEOPLE?
HEAD ON. APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD. HEAD ON. APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD. HEAD ON. APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEAD ON (SPEAKS GERMAN) WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT CIVILITY AND  HONEST DISCOURSE BECAUSE A MAD MAN WENT ON A SHOOTING RAMPAGE BUT THE MEASURE OF OUR DISCOURSE  IS NOT THE AFFECT THAT IT HAS ON A MADMAN. THE MEASURE IS WHAT AFFECT IT SHOULD HAVE ON A RATIONAL PERSON. SO LET'S TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. IF YOU LITERALLY BELIEVE THE REPUBLICANS ARE USING TACTICS THAT UNCHECKED COULD LEAD TO THE  HOLOCAUST, WHERE DOES IT LEAVE A RATIONAL PERSON? YOU CAN'T COMPROMISE WITH THEM, THEY'RE NAZIS! THAT WOULD MAKE US NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN AND I F I'VE GOT TO  BE A CHAMBERLAIN I'D LIKE TO BE RICHARD. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) SO CALL OUT THE LIES. SAY THEY'RE BEING DOUCHEBAGS AND (BEEP) HOLES OR ASS BAGS AND DOUCHE HOLES. BECAUSE THE RATIONAL MIND UNDERSTANDS THAT FOR THE MOST PART THOSE TITLES ARE  SITUATIONAL AND TEMPORARY. WHEN IT COMES TO CIVILITY AND HONEST DISCOURSE I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH COURSENESS, I HAVE  A PROBLEM OF PEOPLE USING HYPERBOLE WITH A GOAL OF ULTIMATELY REDUCING A PEOPLE'S NUMBERS. HEY, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE DID THAT? (LAUGHTER) I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT!
