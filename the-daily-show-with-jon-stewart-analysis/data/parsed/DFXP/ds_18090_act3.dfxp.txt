(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ACCLAIMED  AUTHOR HE WROTE THE  SCREENPLAY FOR THE NEW MOVIE  MIDNIGHT CHILDREN BASED ON HIS BEST SELLING NOVEL.
LIKE A WOMAN.
YOU DO GOD KNOWS WHAT  FIGHTING TERRIBLE WOMEN. YOU EXPECT US TO BE LIKE  THEM. LISTEN, HUSBAND OR NO  HUSBAND, I AM NOT THAT TYPE.
Jon: WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM SALMAN RUSHDIE. (APPLAUSE)  HOW ARE YOU? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,  CONGRATULATIONS. THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS,  AMBITIOUS FILM. YOU WROTE MIDNIGHT'S  CHILDREN, AN INCREDIBLE  NOVEL. HAD YOU ALWAYS, WHEN YOU  WROTE IT, DID YOU THINK TO  YOURSELF, OH THIS WOULD BE A NICE MOVIE.
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT, BACK  THEN I WAS JUST A KID. NOBODY KNEW WHO I WASMENT I  WAS JUST GRATEFUL TO GET  PUBLISHED. AND FOR A FEW PEOPLE WHO  WERE NOT RELATED TO ME TO  BUY COPIES OF IT. THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD TURN  INTO THIS HUGE THING, YOU  KNOW, BIG BEST-SELLER, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, WINNING  PRIZES AND EVENTUALLY-- IT  TOOK 30 YEARS TO MAKE THE  FILM.
Jon: THAT IS ABOUT RIGHT,  HOLLYWOOD YEAR, 30 YEARS. NOW YOU WENT-- WHEN THEY  CAME TO YOU, DID SOMEONE  COME TO YOU AND SAY WE WOULD  LIKE TO TAKE THIS FILM, AND WE WOULD -- AND FOR THOSE OF  YOU WHO DON'T KNOW THE STORY  IT IS A BOY IN A BOAT WITH A TIGER AND-- DO I HAVE THIS  RIGHT?
NO, THAT'S ANOTHER ONE.
Jon: THAT SAY DIFFERENT  ONE. ANYWAY HE WINS A GAME SHOW  WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS--   (LAUGHTER)  AND --
THAT IS ALSO NOT RIGHT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I AM  AFRAID I WILL HAVE TO LOOK  AT MY NOTES.
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO HELP  YOU OUT.
Jon: PLEASE T SAY  BEAUTIFUL STORY ABOUT THE  REFLECTION OF SORT OF THE  BIRTH OF INDIA.
YEAH, IT'S ABOUT INDIA  DOS SOMETHING WHICH AMERICA  DID A LITTLE EARLIER WHICH IS KICKING BRITISH OUT.
Jon: SURE. WE ALL GET THERE AT SOME  POINT, EXCEPT CANADA.
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,  IT'S LIKE THE INDIA WE MAKE  OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE. BUT IT'S ABOUT THESE BOYS  BORN AT THAT MOMENT. AND IT IS ABOUT THAT  GENERATION. AND THESE BOYS GET SWAPPED  AT BIRTH BY A SORT  OF-- MISLEAD MIDWIFE AND  THEY GET, THEY SORT OF HAVE EACH OTHER'S LIFE. THE RICH ONE HAS THE POOR  LIFE AND THE POOR ONE HAS  THE RICH LIFE. AND THEN THEY ODDLY SORT OF  CONFRONT EACH OTHER AT THE  END.
Jon: IT IS SO MUCH  TOO-- THEY SYMBOLIZE NOT  JUST THE BIRTH OF INDIA BUT ALSO ITS PAINFUL PARTITIONS,  THE WARS THAT ARE FOUGHT. THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF  HISTORICAL CONTEXT TO IT.
FORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, I  MEAN YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T WANT  TO -- DIDON'T THINK ANYBODY NEEDS TO STUDY BEFORE THEY  SEE THE FILM. BECAUSE REALLY IT IS  ABOUT-- .
Jon: BY THE WAY THAT IS A  SMART PITCH.
JUST SAYING, IT'S  OKAYMENT WE TELL YOU WHAT  YOU NEED TO KNOW.
Jon: SERIOUSLY, JUST TELL  THEM IT IS A TIG NEVER A  BOAT, THEY'LL GO, THEY'LL  GO.
YES. BUT THEY SAW THAT ONE.
Jon: THEY PROBABLY DID  SEE THAT ONE. TYPICALLY WHEN THEY DO THAT,  THEY WILL COME TO YOU AND  SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO BUY THIS STORY.
YEAH.
Jon: AND REMOVE IT FROM  YOUR CONTROL.
YEAH.
Jon: INJURE RESPONSE TO  THAT.
WELL, THAT ISN'T WHAT  HAPPENED. AS IT HAPPENS, THE FILM  DIRECTOR AND I HAVE KNOWN  EACH OTHER. AND SHE-- I WAS THERE ON  BOOK TOUR. WE HAD DINNER ONE NIGHT AND  IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, JUST  APP RO PROCEED OF NOTHING SAID WHO HAS THE RIGHTS  OF-- WND AND I HAD SAID AS  IT HAPPENS I DO. AND SHE SAID CAN I MAKE A  MOVIE OF IT AND I SAID OKAY,  AND THAT WAS THE DEAL.
Jon: REALLY? JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF LIKE  WOW THIS IS A DELICIOUS  RISOTTO, BY THE WAY.
YES.
Jon: AND JUST THREW IT  OUT THERE.
YEAH, AND THEN WE HAD A  FIERCE NEGOTIATION AND I  SOLD HER THE OPTION FOR $1.
Jon: I'M GOING TO TELL  YOU SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW  HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS YOU I KNOW  SOME GOOD JEWISH AGENTS.
DO YOU FEEL THAT A DOLLAR  WAS NOT ENOUGH?
Jon: I FEEL THAT A  DOLLAR-- I BELIEVE IN THE  BUSINESS WE REFER TO THAT AS PUT KISS.
WELL, THEY DID HAVE THE  RIGHTS TO RENEW THE OPTION  FOR A FURTHER DOLLAR.
Jon: SO YOU REALLY DROVE  THAT ONE HOME, DID YOU?
YEAH.
Jon: AFTER YOU LIQUORED  HER UP YOU THOUGHT I WILL  REALLY NAIL THIS.
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE  AGENTS COMMISSION OFF THAT  TAXES OFF THAT.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT I LOVE  ABOUT THIS, WOULD IT ALLOWED  YOU TO DO WAS TO RETAIN CREATIVE CONTROL.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: WHICH IS EVERYTHING.
WHICH IS EVERYTHING. THAT WAS THE POINT, REALLY. WE ENDED UP-- DAVID HAMILTON  WHO PRODUCED IT THE DIRECTOR  AND ME, THREE OF US, WE HAD TO AGREE. THAT WAS IT.
Jon: SO THIS DID GO THE  ENDIE ROUTE.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU GUYS GOT THE  MONEY, YOU WENT TO DO THIS.
YES. WE WENT OUT AND THEY  BORROWED AND STOLE THE MONEY  BECAUSE WE DIDN'T-- WELL,  WITH THE EMPHASIS ON STOLE.
Jon: I AGREE, THAT'S  FINE. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE  MOVIE BUSINESS BEFORE.
YES, EXACTLY. AND WE EVENTUALLY PUT  TOGETHER JUST ABOUT ENOUGH  MONEY. WE HAD, IT WAS THE MOST  DEMANDING SHOOT. WE HAD 65 DIFFERENT  LOCATIONS IN 70 SHOOTING  DAYS.
Jon: THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
SO IT WAS MEANT TO BE. WE ARE VERY LUCKY THAT WE  HAD THE CAST AND CREW THAT  REALLY PITCHED IN. NOBODY WAS-- RZ.
Jon: WHERE DID YOU FILM.
IN A MIXTURE OF INDIA AND  VEY LANKA.
Jon: THE THING TOO IS THE  FILM STRUCTURE IS SO SO FIST  KATED AN DEVELOPED THAT THEY CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,  A PROJECT OF THAT MAGNITUDE  AND --
WELL, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS  THOUGHT IT WAS UNFAIR ON THE  BOMBAY FILM INDUSTRY TO CALL IT BALI DOES WOOD BECAUSE IT  IS ACTUALLY BIGGER THAN  HOLLYWOOD. HOLLYWOOD SHOULD BE CALLED  LIKE BOMBAY.
Jon: THEY'RE GOING GO FOR  THAT BOMBAY THEY'RE GOING TO  GO FOR. WELL, THE RESULT IS  PHENOMENAL. AND I URGE PEOPLE TO GO SEE  IT. MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN. IT OPENS IN SELECT CITIES ON  FRIDAY. AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLE WORK. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: YOUNG MAN. SALMAN RUSHDIE, EVERYONE. (APPLAUSE)
