Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. NOW WHEN POLITICIANS MEET  THEIR CON SFIT WENT THESE  RUN ITS RISK OF ENCOUNTERING  CRITICISM. EVEN ABUSE OR SOMETHING FAR  WORSE, JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS  MORE.
FORMER UTAH STATE  REPRESENTATIVE STEVEN  SANDSTROM IS A LIFELONG  REPUBLICAN. WHO UNTIL RECENTLY HAD A  DELICATELY NUANCED POSITION  ON IMMIGRATION.
I WANT EVERY ILLEGAL  ALIEN OUT OF THE STATE OF  UTAH. LOCK THEM UP, ROUND THEM UP,  SHIP THEM OUT.
WHY THE [BLEEP] DO I  ALWAYS GET THESE CRAZY ASS  WHITE DUDES. BUT THIS UTAH REPUBLICAN HAD  A TRAGIC STORY TO TELL. AT A TOWN HALL MEETING HIS  BELIEF SYSTEM CAME UNDER  ATTACK BY SOMETHING HE COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED.
IT WAS AFTER ONE OF THOSE  EVENTSES THAT THIS YOUNG  GIRL SARAH CAME AND TALKED TO ME.
THOUGH SHE HAD AN ANGLO  SOUNDING NAME, SHE WAS A  TICKING LATINA TIME BOMB.
SHE SAID I WAS BROUGHT TO  THIS COUNTRY WHEN I WAS TWO  BY MY PARENTS. THEY CAME HERE ILLEGALLY. SHE SAYS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO  DO. I CAN'T GET A JOB. BECAUSE I'M UNDOCUMENTED. SHE HAS NO FUTURE.
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.
SHE MADE ME FEEL, I FELT  COMPASSION.
REALLY?
YES.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A  NIGHTMARE.
I REALIZED YOU SHOULDN'T  LOOK AT PEOPLE.
BECAUSE --
BECAUSE I PUT THAT FACE  ON THERE THAT I HAD NEVER  PUT ON IT BEFORE.
RIGHT. YOU HAD BEEN TALKING TO  PEOPLE YOUR WHOLE LIFE AND  NEVER FELT ANYTHING SO YOU  PROBABLY FIGURED YOU WERE  IMMUNE.
WELL, --
ONCE YOU START TO FEEL  SOMETHING LIKE COMPASSION,  AS A POLITICIAN, THE WHOLE THING GOES OFF THE RAILS.
IT DOES.
YES, SANDSTROM HAD BEEN  INFECTIONED WITH PORTMANNITIS  NAMED FOR OHIO SENATOR ROB PORTMAN WHO REVERSED HIS  POSITION ON GAY MARRIAGE  AFTER FINDING OUT HIS SON  WAS GAY. I HAD HOPED SANDSTROM'S CASE  WAS NOT TOO SEVERE.
WE SHOULD HAVE  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM.
WOW. YOU WERE REALLY FAR GONE.
THIS IS ABOUT HUMAN  BEINGS. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S  LIVES.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING? DO YOU HAVE A FEVERNESS WE  HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY  HAVE A PATHWAY TO  CITIZENSHIP. A GLIMMER OF HOPE.
YOUR EARS ARE VERY WARM. YOU SEEM A LITTLE WARM UP  HERE. OF COURSE SANDSTROM  SUPPORTERS IN UTAH WERE  DEVASTATING. BUT THE BEAUTIFUL THING  ABOUT COMPASSION IS THAT  WHEN GIVEN, IT IS RETURNED  TENFOLD.
I WAS CALLED A TRAITOR, A  LATINO LOVER. ONE PERSON SAID I WAS  EXKREMENT THAT SHOULD BE  FLUSHED DOWN A TOILET. I DON'T WANT TO USE THE REAL  WORD.
DOOD DO O, FESSEST, GAH  GAH, DO HEAD. DO DO BUTT.
I WAS COW TOWNING, I WAS  CALLED A PANDERER.
WHAT ABOUT [BLEEP] BALL -- [BLEEP].
I THAT KIND OF REFERS TO  THE TIME I WAS CALLED  EXKREMENT TO BE FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET.
I NEEDED TO KNOW  SANDSTROM'S PROGNOSIS. I WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD  THINGS ARE. WHAT ARE ARE YOUR THOUGHTS  ON GAY MARRIAGE.
I BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE.
CLIMATE CHANGE.
I CHIEF CLIMATE CHANGE  HAPPENS BUT IS NOT USE  CAUSED BY HUMANS.
GUN RIGHTS.
AMENDMENT RIGHT WZ A LOT  OF YOUR BELIEFS ARE STILL IN  FACT. MOSTLY ARE YOU STILL NOT SUS  SEPTEMBERABLE TO REALITY.
I THINK MY REALITY IS  WHAT THE --
HE WASN'T A LOST CAUSE. BUT TO PREVENT HIS ILLNESS  FROM BECOMING FULL BLOWN  EMPATHY WE NEEDED TO LIMIT  HIS HUMAN INTERACTION. STEVEN DO NOT TALK TO HIM. HE WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF  RECOVERY.
MI NAME IS STEVEN. I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ANY  DETAILS OF YOUR LIFE.
PERFECT. CRISIS AVOIDED BUT THERE WAS  NO QUESTION THAT THE WORLD  OUTSIDE OF HIS HOME WAS FULL OF CONTAMINANTS. IN THE FORM OF PEOPLE WHO HE  MIGHT COME IN CONTACT WITH. TO SAVE SANDSTROM WE FEEDED  TO USE EXTREME MEASURES. AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO SHOW  HIM WHAT WE'D DONE. HERE WE ARE.
OH, OKAY.
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE WHOLE  PROPERTY BUT IT'S KIND OF  WHAT WE COULD AFFORD. I SPENT MOST OF THE BUDGET  ON THESE SIGNS, OBVIOUSLY. SO CAN I COME IN?
SURE G IN.
NO, NO, OF COURSE I CAN'T  COME IN. DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING  TODAY? YOU THINK THAT LATINA CHANGE  YOUR POINT OF VIEW. SPEND AN HOUR WITH ME I WILL  TURN YOUR WHITE ASS INTO A  BLACK PANTHER, OKAY, GUYS, FORGET IT, WE'RE OUT OF  HERE. TAKE EVERYTHING DOWN. GOOD LUCK. IN THE END, SOME LAWMAKERS  ARE JUST TOO OPEN MINDED TO  BE SAVED.
Jon: JE
