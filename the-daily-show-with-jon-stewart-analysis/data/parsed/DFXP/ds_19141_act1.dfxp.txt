>>AUGUST 6, 2014 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A SHOW TONIGHT. WU-TANG CLAN IS GOING TO BE ON TONIGHT. THE WU! HISTORY IN THE MAKING. I MEAN, I GOT TO TELL YOU, IF MY NAME WAS JASON AND I WASN'T HERE, I WOULD BE VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS SHOW. BUT WE'RE WISHING YOU THE BEST, JASON. GET HOME SAFE AND THEN COME AND SEE WU TANG WITH US. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, WHICH HISTORY IN THE MAKING, POLITICAL PRIMARY SEASON STILL HAPPENING. AND LAST NIGHT HUGE NEWS RESULTS IN THE G.O.P.'S TEA PARTY VERSUS ESTABLISHMENT CIVIL WAR, THAT HAS BEEN PITTING YOUNG,  HARDLINE, RIGHT-WING TEA PARTY OBSTRUCTIONISTS AGAINST OLDER  ONES. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE SUBJECT TONIGHT'S DEMOCOLYPSE 2014: BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLICANS. A NUMBER OF PRIMARY VOTES YESTERDAY, FOREMOST AMONG THEM, KANSAS, THREE-TERM CONSERVATIVE SENATOR -- THAT'S NOT HIM -- PAT ROBERTS -- THAT'S HIM! HE RISKED DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF HIS OWN REAL ESTATE DECISIONS.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REVEALED HE DOES NOT HAVE A HOME ADDRESS IN KANSAS.
HIS VOTING ADDRESS IN THE STATE IS ON A COUNTRY CLUB GOLF COURSE.
ROBERTS SPENT JUST A TOTAL OF 97 DAYS IN THE STATE OF KANSAS BETWEEN JULY 2011 AND AUGUST 2013.
Jon: 97 DAYS OVER -- I'M PRETTY SURE THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL TORNADOES THAT HAVE SPENT MORE TIME IN KANSAS THAN 97 DAYS. SENATOR ROBERTS, YOUR DEFENSE?
WHY DON'T YOU LIVE HERE, THOUGH?
EVERY TIME I GET AN OPPONENT -- I MEAN, EVERY TIME I GET CHANCE,  I'M HOME. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: TRUTH IS I ONLY COME TO THIS [BLEEP] HOLE WHEN I HAVE TO. WOW, THAT WASN'T A FREUDIAN SLIP, THAT WAS A FREUDIAN STAGE DIVE. THE ONLY WAY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FREUDIAN IS IF ROBERTS BLURTED OUT THAT HE AVOIDS THE STATE BECAUSE HIS HOT MOM LIVES THERE. [LAUGHTER]  IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO GO TO SLEEP TONIGHT.  IT SEEMS LIKE ROBERTS'S A GONER. HITS ONLY HOPE IS HIS CHALLENGER, MILTON WOLF, TEA PARTY RAIDOLOGIST, TURNS OUT TO BE SOME SORT OF TWISTED SOCIOPATH.
MILTON WOLF ISSUED A STATEMENT SUNDAY ADMITTING HE MADE INSENSITIVE COMMENTS AFTER POSTING SOME GRUESOME X-RAY IMAGES OF GUNSHOT VICTIMS OF HIS FACEBOOK PAGE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: PAT ROBERTS, YOU ARE ONE LUCKY SON OF A BITCH.
WOLF WROTE THAT AN X-RAY OF MAN DECAPITATED BY GUNFIRE  RESEMBLED A WOUND ALIEN IN A "TERMINATOR" FILM.
Jon: THAT'S [BLEEPED] OUTRAGEOUS. FORGET ABOUT INSENSITIVITY. HOW DO YOU ELECT A GUY WHO THINKS TERMINATORS ARE ALIENS? THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE TIME-TRAVELING CYBORGS. THEY WERE MADE ON EARTH IN OUR FUTURE. DID YOU EVEN SEE THE [BLEEPED] MOVIE? THAT IS DISQUALIFYING. [APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY. THANKFULLY IN A VICTORY FOR NERDS EVERYWHERE, SENATOR ROBERTS DEFEATED MR. "I CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH THE DETAILS OF CINEMA'S GREATEST ALTERNATE FUTURE SCI-FI THRILLER SERIES." FROM THE PRIMARIES, WE MOVE ON TO THE GENERAL ELECTION, AND ONE OF THIS YEAR'S CLOSEST WATCHED SENATE RACES. IN KENTUCKY, NAMED FOR ITS LUBE-STREWN HILLS AND MOUNTAINS, AND WHERE 134-YEAR-OLD POLITICAL TRADITION CONTINUES.
15,000 POLITICAL ACTIVISTS, CANDIDATES AND VOTERS, IN WHAT  IS  T  MOST UNFORGETTABLE CAMPAIGN SPECTACLE KENTUCKY HAS TO OFFER, THE ANNUAL FANCY FARM PICNIC IS UNDER WAY.
Jon: FANCY FARM PICNIC, THEY DON'T SERVE FANCY FEAST AT THIS FARM, DO THEY? BECAUSE NOT THEY WOULDN'T LOVE TO SEE MITCH McCONNELL EATING CAT FOOD FROM A CRYSTAL BOWL, HASHTAG "CAT-CONNELLING," NOT SURE THAT'S GOING TO CATCH ON. THE FANCY FARM IS A RAMBUNCIOUS AFFAIR WHERE CANDIDATES ARE ENCOURAGED TO ROAST EACH OTHER FROM THE PODIUM. LET'S HEAR FROM McCONNELL'S CHALLENGER, KENTUCKY SECREATARY   OF STATE, ALISON LUNDERGRAN GRIMES.
WHEN YOU FINALLY SEE SENATOR McCONNELL ON THE SAME STAGE, YOU REALIZE ONLY ONE OF US BELIEVES WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. IF MITCH McCONNELL WERE A TV SHOW, HE'D BE "MAD MEN," TREATING WOMEN UNFAIRLY, STUCK IN 1968 AND ENDING THIS SEASON.
Jon: AND ALWAYS BUMPING OUT TO END CREDIT WITH AN IRONICALLY UPBEAT SONG, AND THEN PREVIEWING NEXT WEEK THE TELLS YOU NOTHING AND MITCH McCONNELL WOULD AIR SUNDAYS AT 10:00 ON AMC, BUT NOT NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE ON A MID-SEASON HIATUS, WHICH IS SOMETHING AMC DOES LIKE WITH "BREAKING BAD." ANYWAY, MY POINT IS THIS: MITCH McCONNELL IS SIMILAR TO THAT SHOW. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT WASN'T GRIMES MATERIAL THAT I LIKED, EVEN THOUGH I DID  LIKE IT, IT WAS SENATOR McCONNELL'S REACTIONS TO HER MATERIAL.
IT'S NOT EASY BEING MITCH McCONNELL. AFTER THREE DECADES IN WASHINGTON, YOU'VE JUST GIVEN UP. I INTEND TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE, AND I DON'T NEED HOUND DOGS TO TRACK YOU DOWN. THANK YOU.
Jon: HE DOESN'T EVEN MOVE. NOT, NOT A SINGLE TWITCH, NOTHING. EITHER MITCH McCONNELL HAS, THROUGH YEARS LONG PRACTICE OF CONTROLLED BREATHING AND ZEN MEDITATION ACHIEVED A DEEP, METABOLISM SLOWING TRANSSTATE OR THAT MAN IS DEAD INSIDE. BROTHER, SHE'S RIPPING YOU TO SHREDS. BLINK. HIS REACTIONS ARE SO INSCRUTABLE, YOU COULD USE THEM FOR ANYTHING.
WHAT'S IN THE BOX. WHAT'S IN THE BOX? OH, GOD.
Jon: OR...
HEY, EVERYBODY, WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET LAID!
Jon: OR, I SURE WOULD LIKE THE HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS. [LAUGHTER] FOLLOWING A GOLF MATCH. YEP. WELL, WE'VE HEARD GRIMES THROW DOWN. YOUR MOVE, McCONNELL.
OBAMA WOULDN'T GO DOWN TO THE BORDER. HE SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE PHOTO OPS. HE'S TAKEN MORE SELFIES THAN FLAT STANLEY.
Jon: FLAT STANLEY DOESN'T TAKE SELFIES.  FLAT STANLEY IS A PIECE OF PAPER. [LAUGHTER] MR. STANLEY ASKS SECOND PARTIES TO TAKE THOSE PHOTOS ON HIS BEHALF. THEY'RE NOT SELFIES. WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS WITH YOU GUYS. THANK GOD KENTUCKY'S OTHER SENATOR RABID PAUL STOPPED BY TO RESTORE SOME DIGNITY TO THE PROCEEDINGS.
THERE ONCE WAS A WOMAN FROM KENTUCKY... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IF YOU SAY WHOSE [BLEEPED] WAS SO LONG SHE COULD  SUCKY, I-I WILL MAKE YOU THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THERE ONCE WAS A WOMAN FROM KENTUCKY, WHO THOUGHT IN POLITICS SHE'D BE LUCKY. SO SHE FLEW TO L.A. FOR A HOLLYWOOD BASH. SHE CAME HOME IN A FLASH WITH BUCKETS OF CASH. ONE THING THAT WE KNOW IS TRUE, ONE THING WE KNOW IS GUARANTEED, SHE'D CAST HER FIRST VOTE FOR HARRY REID.
Jon: THERE ONCE WAS A MAN NAMED RAND PAUL. HIS LIMERICK SKILLS SUCKED MY BALLS. HIS COIF WAS SO CURLY, HIS PROSE MADE ME SURLY --  BALLS, BALLS, BALLS, BALLS. HEY, I WONDER HOW SENATOR McCONNELL LIKED MY POEM. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
