(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HIS LATEST  FILM IS CALLED "OBLIVION."
TECHNICIAN 4-9, SHIPS SYSTEMS  ARE GREEN. I'M GOOD TO GO.
COPY TECH 4-9, YOU'VE  CLEARED.
GOOD WORK ON THAT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW TOM CRUISE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: .
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: THE PEOPLE LOVE! THEY LOVE!
THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SIT IN THE CHAIR, FOR GOD'S  SAKE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT, MAN.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GREAT TO SEE YOU.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I DON'T  LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH?
Jon: SO YOU DROP INTO PITS  ON ROPES ON THAT WIRE, YOU'RE  DOING THESE FLIPS AND THINGS AND STUNTS AND YOU DID THEM AND  YOU'RE MY AGE AND IT UPSETS ME. (LAUGHTER)  TO NO END. THAT'S WHY -- BECAUSE THEY SAID,  YOU KNOW, I GO "HE DID SOME  CRAZY STUNTS IN THIS THING."
AND AND THEY SAID "YOU KNOW  HE'S 50 NOW."  AND I SAID "NO, I'M   50,".
(LAUGHS).
Jon: HOW ARE YOU STILL  PULLING THAT OFF?
I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  I HAVE NO IDEA.
Jon: IS IT TRAINING?
A LOT OF TRAINING.
Jon: IS IT ADVIL? (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, EVERY NOW AND THEN. EVERY NOW AND THEN AFTER A VERY  HARD HIT YOU'VE GOT TO DO THAT.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE -- IT'S  HARD TO TALK ABOUT WITH PEOPLE  WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY SO LET ME IF I COULD GIVE IT AWAY.
PLEASE. (LAUGHTER)  JUST RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE.
Jon: (WHISPERING)  HE'S DEAD THE WHOLE TIME. (LAUGHTER)  HOW DO YOU -- WHEN YOU GO INTO  SOMETHING LIKE THIS HOW DO YOU  CHOOSE THE NEXT PROJECT? THE FILMS YOU MAKE, THEY HAVE AN  INTENSITY TO THEM THAT I THINK  ARE THESE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE DRAWN TO? YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE AN  ADRENALINE JUNKIE? THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU  WANT TO --
WHAT I THINK OF IS I WANT TO  ENTERTAIN AN AUDIENCE. THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING OF. WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE  EXCITED. I MET JOE KACZYNSKI WHEN HE WAS  IN POSTPRODUCTION ON "TRON" AND  I HEARD ABOUT THIS BRILLIANT YOUNG FILMMAKER. THIS IS ONLY HIS SECOND MOVIE.
Jon: THIS IS HIS SECOND  MOVIE?
THIS IS HIS SECOND MOVIE.
Jon: THAT'S UPSETTING AS  WELL. (LAUGHTER)
I KNOW! AND I MET WITH HIM AND HE HAD  THIS STORY AND HE TOLD ME THE  STORY AND I WAS LIKE "I WANT TO MAKE THIS MOVIE."
Jon: THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY  VISUAL FILM AND THE SETS ARE  INCREDIBLE AND THERE ARE --
JUST EVEN THAT SEQUENCE THAT  YOU SAW, YOU SEE THE CLOUDS IN  THE BACKGROUND. HE ACTUALLY WENT AND  PHOTOGRAPHED CLOUDS AND STARS  AND SUNRISES AND SUNSETS ATOP A VOLCANO AND PROJECTED THAT. THAT'S NOT GREEN SCREEN.
Jon: YOU'RE KIDDING ME!
NO. SO WHEN YOU'RE SEEING THOSE  SETS, THAT'S THE AMBIENT LIGHT.
Jon: IF YOU'RE TELLING ME  THAT SHIP IS REAL, TOO --  (LAUGHTER). I'M GOING TO GET VERY UPSET WITH  THIS ENTIRE THING! (LAUGHTER)
IT'S REAL. (LAUGHTER)  IT IS! I SO WISH IT WAS REAL.
Jon: BUT IT'S LIKE A  POSTAPOCALYPTIC HELL SCAPE BUT  YOU WATCH IT AND YOU'RE LIKE "I COULD LIVE THERE. THEY'VE GOT COOL STUFF THERE."  SO HOW DO YOU TRUST A GUY DOING  HIS SECOND FILM.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO YOUR FIRST  FILM. VERY COOL.
Jon: DEATH TO SMOOCHIE AND  THEN THIS.
VERY COOL.
Jon: BUT YOU TRUST A GUY TO  WORK WITH AN ACTOR OF YOUR  EXPERIENCE.
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE FUN OF  IT. YOU SIT DOWN AND I'VE PRODUCED A  LOT OF FILMS AND I LEARN FROM  HIM AND I JUST KIND OF WORK WITH HIM AND SAY OKAY, WHAT'S THE  STORY? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CREATE? AND I THEME TO HELP AS AN ACTOR  ON SET I'M JUST DOING MY JOB AND  YOU CAN SEE THE GUY THE JUST ENORMOUSLY TALENTED.
Jon: IS IT DIFFICULT TO  RELINQUISH CONTROL?
NO. NO BECAUSE IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO  MAKE A MOVIE. IT'S NOT --
Jon: YEAH, THAT WAS THE  LESS SUCCESSFUL SEQUEL TO  HILLARY CLINTON'S BOOK. (LAUGHTER)  IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO MAKE A  MOVIE.
(LAUGHS)  TO MAKE A MOVIE. (LAUGHS)
Jon: EVERY NOW AND AGAIN I  GET ONE OFF.
YOU DO, YOU DO. IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M  WORKING ON SOMETHING IT'S NOT  ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT THE STORY. YOU BRING A TEAM OF PEOPLE AND  YOU JUST WANT THEM TO GIVE YOU  THEIR BEST AND SO, NO.
Jon: MORGAN FREEMAN.
LEGEND.
Jon: LEGEND! AND WHATEVER HE'S IN A MOVIE I  ALWAYS FEEL LIKE "OH, EVERYTHING  WILL TURN OUT."
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE  MORGAN FREEMAN WOULDN'T LET BAD  THINGS HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER)
NO, NO.
Jon: HE'S THAT TYPE OF  DUDE.
HE'S GOT THAT KIND OF  PRESENCE. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO WORK WITH  HIM FOREVER.
Jon: THIS IS THE FIRST  TIME?
FIRST TIME. AND I ADMIRE HIS WORK SO MUCH. DID YOU EVER SEE "STREET SMART"?
NO.
INCREDIBLE. IT'S HIS FIRST --
Jon: FORGET ABOUT  "OBLIVION."  "STREET SMART."  OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PROMOTING "OBLIVION."
Jon: "STREET SMART" WITH  MORGAN FREEMAN. IT'S ON NETFLIX. (LAUGHTER)  BUT HE CAN DO EVERYTHING.
I BLEW THAT, DIDN'T I?
Jon: NOT AT ALL. AND EVERYTHING THAT HE DOES --  THERE'S A QUALITY TO IT, A  HUMANITY TO IT. HE'S ONE OF THOSE GUYS YOU  ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THERE'S A  HUMANITY TO EACH CHARACTER HE  BRINGS.
NO MATTER WHAT THE CHARACTER,  GOOD GUY OR BAD GUY. HE'S JUST THAT VOICE, TOO. AND I THINK -- I DON'T WANT TO  GIVE IT AWAY --
Jon: GIVE IT AWAY! I'LL GIVE IT AWAY, IT'S NOT A  TWIST. HIS VOICE COMES OUT AND IT'S  VERY POWERFUL. HE'S MORGAN FREEMAN AND HE'S  VERY POWERFUL.
Jon: I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED  THIS ABOUT FILM BECAUSE IT'S  VERY DIFFERENT THAN TELEVISION. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS EVERYDAY  FOR LIKE 15 YEARS AND WE BECOME  A FAMILY AND THE CAMARADERIE AND  FRIENDSHIPS. WHEN YOU DO THE FILM, THOUGH,  THE INTENSITY IS SO GREAT AND  THEN EVERYBODY GOES "HEY, MAN, THAT WAS FUN. OKAY, SEE YOU AT THE PREMIER."  DO YOU JUST PILE UP FRIEND THAT  YOU CORRESPONDENT WITH?
YOU PILE UP FRIEND YOU  CORRESPOND WITH AND WHEN YOU SEE  THE EACH OTHER IT'S LIKE TIME HADN'T PASSED.
Jon:
Jon: OLD HOME WEEK.
IT REALLY IS.
Jon: EXCEPT FOR ONE DUDE  WHO YOU HATE AND YOU CAN NAME  HIM RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT. (LAUGHTER)  JUST NAME ONE.
EXCEPT FOR, YOU KNOW -- AND  NO ONE WANTS TO TALK TO HIM  ANYWAY.
Jon: GIVE IT AWAY! (LAUGHTER)  "OBLIVION" WILL BE IN THEATERS  ON FRIDAY COMPETING AGAINST  "STREET SMART." I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO  HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER)  TOM CRUISE, THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR BEING HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
