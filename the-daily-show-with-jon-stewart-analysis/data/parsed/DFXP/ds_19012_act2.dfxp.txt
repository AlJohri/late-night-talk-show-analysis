Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. SO YOU JUST SAW HOW THINGS ARE GETTING HARDER AND HARDER FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. OVERSEAS POPULARITY IS PLUMMETING. AT HOME HEALTH CARE.GOV PROVING TO BE THE COUNTRY'S FOURTH LEAST FAVORITE WEB SITE FOLLOWING THE NATIONAL ZOO'S DEAD PANDA CAM.  LOU PORN, THE SITE THAT CUTS OUT LOU DOBB'S HEAD AND PUTS IT OVER YOUR FAVORITE PORN STARS. AND OF COURSE, MACE BOOK, THE WEB SITE THAT SPRAYS MACE IN YOUR FACE EVERY TIME YOU LOG ON. ONE MORE PIECE OF BAD NEWS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION.
A WHITE HOUSE INSIDER WITH SENIOR LEVEL SECURITY CLEARANCE TURNS OUT TO HAVE A DUAL IDENTITY. ONE AT WORK AND ONE ON-LINE.
JOFI JOSEPH WAS DIRECTOR OF NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION ISSUES AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. HE HAD A SECRET ON-LINE PERSONAE OPERATING UNDER THE TWITTER HANDLE NATSECWONK.
Jon: WHAT DID THIS GUY DO, LEAK NATIONAL SECRETS, TELL EVERYONE'S BIDEN'S PASSWORD, BY THE WAY, IT'S PASSWORD, I KNOW.
HE WAS BEHIND ANONYMOUS TWITTER ACCOUNTS THAT TOOK POTSHOTS AT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.
Jon: OH, SO IT'S LIKE LESS DEEP THROAT AND MORE GOSSIP GIRL? DID THIS GUY BRING THE SNARK.
I'M A FAN OF OBAMA BUT HIS CONTINUING RELIANCE AND DEPENDENCE UPON A VACUOUS CIPHER LIKE VALERIE JARRETT CONCERNS ME. SO WHEN WILL SOMEONE DO US THE FAVOR OF GETTING RID OF SARAH PALIN AND THE REST OF HER WHITE TRASH FAMILY, I'M DYING TO CALL OUT LIZ CHENEY FOR THE OVERWEIGHT PIG THAT SHE IS BUT I REMEMBER THAT MIKE ENZI WEIGHS EVEN MORE, FAIL.
Jon: THAT'S NOT SNARK, THAT IS NOT EVEN FUNNY, THAT'S JUST MEAN [BLEEP]. THE GUY SEEMS TO HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH WOMEN HERE WHAT THE-- PEREZ HILTON CAN'T YOU AT LEAST DRAW SOME DICKS AND COKE ON PEOPLE'S FACES, JUST TO BE CLEVER? AND I HAVE TO SAY, MAN, DOING ALL THAT STUFF ON TWITTER, THAT IS A STUPID MOVE THIS IS THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY'RE SURVEILING EVERYONE'S EVERY MOVE. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO CATCH THIS GUY, AN HOUR.
FOR MONTHS WEST WING OFFICIALS SEARCHED FOR THE MYSTERIOUS TWEETER.
Jon: YOU CAN TAP THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR'S PHONE BUT BITCHING MCSNARKINGTON WAS THREE CUBICLES AWAY AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO EVADE SUSPICION.
16,000 TWEETS OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS, AN AVERAGE OF 17 PER DAY.
PRESUMABLY JOSEPH HAD TO GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO TWEET AS MUCH AS HE DID. PROBABLY STEPPING OUTSIDE OF HIS OFFICE TO USE HIS PERSONAL PHONE FOR THE SNARKY TWEETS.
Jon: HE STEPPED AWAY FROM HIS DESK 17 TIMES A DAY! AND SUDDENLY WHEN HE DOES A NEW TWEET APPEARS AND NOBODY THOUGHT ANYTHING? DID YOU JUST THINK YOU HAD A BLADDER THE SIZE OF A PING-PONG BALL? THERE GOES JOFI AGAIN THAT GUY PEES MORE THAN ANYONE-- HEY, LOOK, A NEW POST, WHAT IS THIS. I CAN'T WAIT FOR JOFI TO GET BACK SO I CAN SHOW HIM  THE-- THERE IS ONE FACT ABOUT THE STORY THAT DOES STAND OUT TO ME ABOVE ALL OTHERS.
THE FOLLOWERS WERE SOME THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS AND OBSERVERS IN WASHINGTON. ALL THE JOURNALISTS FOLLOWED HIS TWEETS. ALL THE OFFICIALS, AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HE WAS INSULTING. SO HE HAD A VERY ELITE READERSHIP.
Jon: YOU HEAR THAT AND THINK THAT IS A SYMPTOM OF WASHINGTON CULTURE THAT THRIVES ON GOSSIP AND NASTINESS BUT I HEAR SOMEONE AT THE WHITE HOUSE KNOWS HOW TO USE THE INTERNET. AND GIVE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. SO MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T FIRE THIS GUY, MAYBE THEY PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF RUNNING THE OLD HEALTHCARE.GOV. NOW IT COULD WORK BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU SIGN UP THE MESSAGE WOULD BE SLIGHTLY MORE LIKE WELCOME TO OBAMACARE YOU FAT PIECE OF [BLEEP]. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
