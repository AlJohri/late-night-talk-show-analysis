FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU THIS EVENING. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER SECRETARY OF TREASURY TIM GEITHNER, WILL BE HERE, AUTHOR OF THE NOVEL, WELL BOOK, "STRESS TEST." I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT'S ABOUT. (LAUGHTER) OFF THE TOP, AN APOLOGY. LAST NIGHT, I MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY MADE SOME DEROGATORY REMARKS TOWARDS PHILLIES MANAGER RYNE SANDBERG AND THE ENTIRE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. AND WHILE A CITY THAT FAMOUSLY BOOED AND THREW SNOWBALLS AT SANTA CLAUSE MAY DESERVE SOME SHADE, I HURT SOME PEOPLE THAT I CARE ABOUT VERY MUCH, INCLUDING, ONE, PHILIP E. PHANATIC. PHILLY THEY CALL HIM. NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO NEED TO REHASH WHO CALLED WHO "A (BLEEP) UP JIM HENSON REJECT LOOKING PIECE OF (BLEEP)." THE POINT IS, IT WAS SAID. MOST LIKELY BY THE ONE OF US WHO DOESN'T HAVE A BLOW TICKLER IN PLACE OF A FUNCTIONING LARYNX. HOWEVER, AFTER OUR TAPING, I REALIZED THAT "MY" PREFERRED BASEBALL CLUB, THE NEW YORK METROPOLITANS HAS A MASCOT ALSO INHABITS THE NETHERWORLD TWIXT HUMAN AND ANIMAL. HE HAS A GIANT BASEBALL INSTEAD OF A HEAD. WHY AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THAT CONDITION WOULD TAKE A JOB IN A PLACE WHERE HE IS SURROUNDED ALL DAY BY BATS, SEEMS LIKE A RECIPE FOR TROUBLE. THE POINT IS, I'M APOLOGIZE IF I OFFENDED MR. PHANATIC. I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN SINCE THAT SEX TAPE CAME OUT. SERIOUSLY, WAS THAT THE CARDINAL MASCOT IN THE CORNER PLEASURING HIMSELF. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GUY GOT IN THERE. WITH THAT OUT OF THE WAY, WE TURN TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF "DEMOCALYPSE 2014: THE RACE TO CONTINUED INCUMBENCY." YESTERDAY SAW PRIMARY VOTES IN SIX STATES. BUT NOT YOUR USUAL, BORING PRIMARIES. THIS TIME, THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS ON THE LINE.
IS THE TEA PARTY OVER? ACROSS THE NATION, ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS SEEMINGLY TAMED THE TEA PARTY.
THE ESTABLISHMENT WON LAST NIGHT.
THE TEA PARTY REPUBLICANS THEY GOT SPANKED. SHELLACKED.
PURPLE NURPLED! SWIRLIED. THROUGHOUT THE NATION TEA PARTY TITTIES WERE TWISTED. FOR PROOF THE TEA PARTY IS FINISHED, LOOK TO FURTHER THAN KENTUCKY.
MCCONNELL WAS THE NUMBER ONE REPUBLICAN TARGET FOR TEA PARTY
MCCONNELL WAS THE NUMBER ONE REPUBLICAN TARGET FOR TEA PARTY GROUPS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND HE EASILY BEAT BACK MATT BEVIN, A SELF STYLED TEA PARTIER.
Jon: I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME FOOTAGE FROM THAT RACE!
BUT I JUST LEFT YOU! HOW DID YOU GET UP HERE ANYWAY?
OH, UH, JUST RUNNIN'.
AND ALSO I GOT A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, SO THAT HELPED. AH YUP.
MITCH MCCONNELL, THE ULTIMATE MAINSTREAM ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN, HANDILY DEFEATING THE TEA PARTY EXTREMISTS. ONCE MORE KEEPING OUR GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRAZIES WHO SAY THINGS LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA IS "DESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION."
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS TREATING OUR CONSTITUTION WORSE THAN A PLACEMAT AT DENNY'S.
OR THOSE INSANE PEOPLE WHO SAY WE HAVE TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE!
IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT, WE WOULD REPEAL OBAMACARE.
OR JUST THE GENERAL TEA PARTY, OBSTRUCTIONIST, PISTOL WAVING ALARMIST RHETORIC!
GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.
THIS IS RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT AT ITS WORST.
OBAMACARE IS THE WORST LEGISLATION PASSED IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY. DENY OBAMA A SECOND TERM. STOP THIS TRAIN WRECK. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO, YEAH, TAKE THAT TEA PARTY! DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE TEA PARTY IS SO MUCH LOST AS FOUND A NEW HOST! BY THE WAY OUR OWN JASON JONES RECENTLY WENT TO INDIA TO EXPORT OUR OWN AMERICAN STYLE POLITICS TO THEM. TURNS OUT THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACY ALREADY HAS AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM THEY'RE PRETTY HAPPY WITH.
I CAME TO INDIA TO GIVE 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE A LESSON IN DEMOCRACY, BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY DIDN'T NEED ONE WHICH MADE ME SAD, DOWNTRODDEN UNTIL I SAW THIS. (ARGUING) THEIR DEMOCRACY MAY BE GREAT BUT THEIR NEWS WAS WORSE THAN OURS. SUDDENLY, I HAD NEW PURPOSE, I HAD TO SAVE THEM FROM THE PATH THEY WERE ON. HEY, CAN I SPEAK WITH YOUR YOUR BIGGEST NEWS DOUCHE?  LOOK ANY BIG, BLOVIATING TALKING HEAD.  LET ME TALK TO THAT GUY. YEAH, I'M FROM AMERICA. I'LL JUST GO SEE HIM. AND HE WAS CNN IBN EDITOR-IN-CHIEF RAJDEEP SARDESAI.
Jon: CNN IBN, IS THAT RELATED OUR (BLEEP) CNN?
YEP, UNFORTUNATELY. > OH, IT IS.
OR FORTUNATELY.
FORTUNATELY? YOU SAID UNFORTUNATELY.
NO, I SAID FORTUNATELY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS GREAT TO HAVE A BRAND NAME LIKE CNN.
IT'S NOT A GREAT BRAND NAME.
THIS IS NOT ON AIR RIGHT?
THIS, THIS RIGHT NOW? NO IT IS.
OH IT IS? OKAY. IT'S A TERRIFIC BRAND NAME.
A NEWS BRAND THAT PROUDLY CHANGES THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF VOTERS IN INDIA FROM 815 MILLION TO 1 BILLION BECAUSE IT SOUNDS BETTER.
IF I SAID 800 MILLION YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER IT. I SAY A BILLION, YOU REMEMBER IT.
RIGHT, I'LL REMEMBER THAT IT'S WRONG.
IT'S A GOOD AMERICAN WAY OF DOING THINGS.
WHAT? THE WRONG WAY?
NO, BRAND RECALL. THE AMERICANS LOVE BRAND RECALL.
DO NOT USE US AS AN EXAMPLE, ALL WE DO ON AMERICAN TELEVISION NEWS IS SHOUT AT EACH OTHER.
WE DO A LOT OF THAT. PEOPLE LIKE NOISE, I'M TOLD, ON TV.
THEY DON'T. BUT OUR NEWS NOISE ISN'T THE ONLY PRODUCTION ELEMENT THEY ENVY.
I THINK YOU MAKE TERRIFIC GRAPHICS AT ELECTION TIME. ALL THE GIZMOS. I LOVE THE AMERICAN GIZMOS. THE HOLOGRAMS. WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A BIG VIDEO WALL.
DO YOU REALLY WANT THAT?
YEAH, I LIKE THAT.
AND, INDIA IS USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER NEWS IN THE MOST CONFUSING WAYS IMAGINABLE. ♪♪
I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE INDIAN TELEVISION IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE IT IS.
YOU DON'T READ TWEETS ON THE AIR, DO YOU?
I LOVE THEM! HASHTAGS! TRENDING! WHAT'S TRENDING.
NO.
OH, THEY'RE FANTASTIC.
HE LOVES TWEETS SO MUCH HE TAKES THEM FROM EVERYONE, EVEN ADOLPH HITLER. BUT THE ONE THING AMERICAN NEWS HAS THAT RAJDEEP WANTS MOST IS --
I'D LOVE TO HAVE MORE ANCHORS THAT LOOK LIKE SOME OF YOUR AMERICAN ANCHORS.
YOU WANT PRETTIER ANCHORS.
YEAH, I'D LOVE TO HAVE PRETTIER ANCHORS.
BUT YOU WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB.
THAT'S OKAY. I LOVE THEM! I LOVE THEM.
SO INDIA'S CABLE NEWS IS A TERRIBLE LOUD MESS. LUCKILY, INDIANS LOOKING FOR IN-DEPTH REPORTING NEED TO ONLY TURN TO ONE OF THEIR 93,000 REGISTERED NEWSPAPERS. THAT'S RIGHT, INDIA'S PRINT MEDIA FOUND A SURPRISING NEW WAY TO REMAIN PROFITABLE.
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED RECENTLY IS THE PAID NEWS. LOOKS LIKE A NEWS STORY AND IT HAS BEEN PAID FOR.
YEAH WE HAVE THAT. THEY LABEL THEM AT THE TOP, THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYMORE.
IN LEGITIMATE PAPERS?
EVEN BIG PAPERS. OPINION POLLS ARE ALSO MANUFACTURED LIKE THAT.
YOU CAN BUY OPINION POLLS?
YOU CAN BUY OPINION POLLS. >>THAT'S CRAZY!
YES.
AND INDIAN JOURNALISTS LIKE THE MILLENNIUM POST'S PUJA GUPTA ARE UNDERSTANDABLY OUTRAGED BY THIS UNETHICAL PRACTICE. I CAN JUST GO OUT AND BUY A STORY WRITTEN BY MYSELF?
YEAH.
BUT THAT'S SO WRONG.
FAKENEWS IS WRONG.
IT'S GROSS.
YES, YES. I TOTALLY, TOTALLY OPPOSE IT.
SO, WOULD YOU WRITE A STORY ABOUT ME?
IF YOU PAY ME MONEY.
SO, I TOSSED THE MILLENNIUM POST $2,500 AND WE GOT DOWN TO BUSINESS.
FIRST QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED IN INDIAN POLITICS?
I'M ACTUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN INDIAN POLITICS, BUT CAN YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE I AM?
I CAN DO THAT.
JUST LIKE, I'M DOING THE BEST TO COVER IT. HOW ABOUT A POLL THAT SAYS I'M GOING TO BEST COVERAGE. CAN YOU DO THAT?
I CAN DO THAT. THIS IS A VERY PRIVATE KIND OF CONVERSATION.
AS A REAL JOURNALIST, YOU HAVE ETHICS. BUT AS A PAID JOURNALIST, JUST WRITE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU.
OKAY.
TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST EASIER FOR ME TO WRITE THE ARTICLE MYSELF AND THE NEXT MORNING IT WAS PRINTED IN A NATIONAL NEWSPAPER THAT HERALDS ITSELF AS HAVING NO HALF TRUTHS, THERE IT WAS ON PAGE 2, A STORY THAT WAS 100% LIES. SERIOUSLY, I REALLY DID THIS. GO TO THIS LINK AND YOU CAN READ THE ARTICLE YOURSELF.
JASON JONES IS GIVING THE BEST ELECTION COVERAGE, IT SAYS.
THIS IS YOUR BODY?
THIS IS MY BODY, YES. I LOOK LIKE THAT. DID YOU SEE TODAY'S NEWSPAPER?
YES. YOU ARE LOOKING SMART IN THIS PIC.
SMART MEANS HOT?
YOU ARE LOOKING HOT YES.
DO YOU BELIEVE THOSE?
NO. I AM A JOURNALIST. I CAN FIGURE IT OUT. BUT THE COMMON MAN, THEY MUST HAVE THOUGH, OKAY, THE GUY LOOKS LIKE THIS.
YOU CAN'T TRUST THE MEDIA, THAT'S REALLY SAD.
YEAH.
I HAD TO GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS PAID NEWS WAS AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE NEWS SOURCE TRUSTED ENOUGH TO SPREAD MY MESSAGE. (ARGUING)
WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT PAID NEWS? THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE YELLING ABOUT. RAJDEEP CUT OFF THEIR MICS AND TALK AND PAID NEWS. IT'S AWFUL. JASON JONES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE)
