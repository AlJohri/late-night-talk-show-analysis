AMAZING. Jon: FIRST OF ALL, YOU LOOK  LIKE [BLEEP]. SECOND OF ALL, HOW DOES DAVID  BRENT END UP IN AMUSE I CAN  VIDEO?
WELL, I KEPT GETTING PEOPLE  ON TWITTER OR THINGS. WHAT'S HE DOING NOW? I DON'T WANT TO MAKE STUFF UP. IT'S A FICTIONAL CHARACTER SO I  THOUGHT I WOULD BRING HIM BACK  TO THAT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE PIECE
Jon: WHAT IS HE DOING NOW? HE'S RESTING, AS HE SAID. HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP THAT  CASH COW. AND HIS OTHER PASSIONS. HE THINKS HE'S A LOCAL RAPPER. BUT HE WORMED HIS WAY INTO IT. HE CAN'T BELIEVE HIS LUCK.
Jon: TERRIFIC. OF COURSE HE GETS EVERYTHING  WRONG. THIS IS HIS IDEA. THIS SONG IS HIS IDEA OF, YOU  KNOW, CHANGING THE WORLD
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU... HE GETS IT ALL WRONG OF  COURSE.
Jon: NOW YOU STARTED A  WHOLE... THIS IS LIKE A CHANNEL  YOU STARTED?
YES  Jon: HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK? IT'S LIKE A, YOU KNOW, LIKE  A...
Jon: DO YOU THINK YOU'RE  OPRAH?
YES  Jon: YOU CAN'T JUST START A  CHANNEL.
THIS IS THE FUTURE. THIS IS THE FUTURE
Jon: WHAT IS THE FUTURE? UST PEOPLE BROADCASTING ON  YOU-TUBE. IT'S MASSIVE. YOU-TUBE IS THE BIGGEST  FORECASTER IN THE WORLD. ... BROADCASTER IN THE WORLD
Jon: THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE  LIKE SIX-YEAR-OLDS COMING OUT OF  PAIN MEDICATION. THERE'S ALREADY TELEVISION. WHY NOT WRITE SOMETHING AND PUT  IT ON TELEVISION? YOU CAN'T DEFEAT THEM ON  YOU-TUBE.
TELEVISION IS DEAD. Jon: TELEVISION IS NOT DEAD. NO ONE IS WATCHING THIS. Jon: YOU'RE GOING TO WORK  YOUR ASS OFF FOR TWO MONTHS ON A  BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT MUSIC VIDEO AND A [BLEEP] LIKE GETTING  SPRAYED BY A COKE IS GOING TO  BLOW BY YOU AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.
I'M GOING TO SIGN THAT CAT  UP. SNAIRLS ON YOUR CHANNEL?
AND TAKE 90% OF ITS EARNINGS. IT'S GOING TO BE HAPPY. WHAT DO I GET? YOU GET A LITTLE PIECE OF FISH. THAT'S ALL.
Jon: I AM A TRAINED MIME. AND THIS...
NO, IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THIS. Jon: WE'RE DOING THE  VAUDEVILLIAN TAKE OF FEEDING A  CAT. TO THE MOON.
EXACTLY. Jon: IT'S A CAT. IS THIS BEING BROADCAST NOW? BECAUSE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF [BLEEP] TELEVISION. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THIS WOULDN'T GO ON YOU-TUBE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT IS TRUE. WE COULD DO THIS WHOLE SHOW  IN A TWEET.
Jon: YOU'RE AN OLD MAN. YOU'RE LIKE ME.
I KNOW. Jon: WHY? BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY  IDIOTS OUT THERE TO ENJOY. USUALLY I HAVE TO GO INTO  PRISONS OR RUBBISH PITS TO MEET  PEOPLE. NOW I CAN DO IT FROM THE COMFORT  OF MY MANSION. IT'S AMAZING. THEY SAY SUCH STUPID THINGS. MY FAVORITE ONE IS, HEY,  EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR  OWN BELIEFS SO JUST SHUT UP ABOUT YOUR RACISM. THAT'S MY FAVORITE. THAT'S MY FAVORITE. I LOVE IT
Jon: AND YOU RESPOND TO THEM. YES, OF COURSE. I WANT TO SHARE STUPIDITY WITH  THE WORLD. THAT'S MY JOB
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I DO. THAT'S MY POINT. WHY DO IT ON... BUT I THOUGHT  THE WHOLE POINT OF CELEBRITY OF  SUCCESS WAS TO WALL YOURSELF OFF FROM THAT CONTACT?
IT'S TOO TEMPTING. IT'S JUST WAY TOO TEMPTING WHEN  PEOPLE SAY STUPID THINGS.
Jon: WHEN DO YOU SLEEP? THESE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IF YOU ENGAGE ONE, HOW DO YOU  STOP?
YOU SEE, I HAVE TO THINK  ABOUT A TWEET. THAT WILL DO ON TWITTER. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR TWITTER. TODAY ON THE WAY HERE IN THE CAR  I DID ABOUT THREE TWEETS. I SAID IF NO ONE RETWEETS THIS I  WILL GIVE $10,000 TO CHARITY. HUNDREDS OF RETWEETS. I SAID YOU'RE NOT LISTENING,  OKAY? IF NOT ONE PERSON RETWEETS THIS  I WILL GIVE $15,000 TO CHARITY,  RIGHT? 500 RETWEETS. AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING,  YOUR FOLLOWERS ARE ALL IDIOTS. SO I'M RETWEETING THAT. IT'S LIKE AMAZING.
Jon: IT'S JUST ANGERING  PEOPLE.
I'M LIKE THE DEVIL. NO ONE REALLY GETS HURT. IT'S LIKE I'M LOOKING DOWN ON  ANTS. IT IS FUN. I KNOW THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS AND  I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. BUT IT'S FUN
Jon: YOU DON'T REALIZE ABOUT  ANTS. THEY HAVE 100 TIMES THEIR BODY  WEIGHT IN STRENGTH. THEY WILL DRAG YOU INTO A HOLE  AND NO ONE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN.
I HEARD THAT ON CNN SO THAT'S  A FACT.
Jon: YOU DID IT. YOU DID IT, BOY. CHECK OUT HIS NEW YOU-TUBE  CHANNEL.
I'M LIKE OPRAH. Jon: DEREK ON NETFLIX THIS  SUMMER. RICKY GERVAIS, EVERYBODY.
