["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT. GREAT ONE TONIGHT. JENNIFER LOPEZ IS JOINING US  TONIGHT. FIRST TIME ON THE PROGRAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A SINGER OF NOTE SUGGESTS A  POWERFUL CONTROVERSY OUT OF  WASHINGTON TONIGHT.
BEYONCE MAY HAVE LIP SYNCED  THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE  WHERE IT WAS PRETAPED.
Jon: IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BON YEAH AT  ALL BUT NOTED MANTEI TE'O  PRANKSTER RONAIAH TUIASOSOPO. TUIASOSOPO. SAY IT DIDN'T TRU'E. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE BEYONCE LIP SYNCED WHO  GIVES A (bleep). SHE'S A PHENOMENAL SINGER. DID YOU SEE CLARKSON, BROUGHT  GAME! ♪ GREAT GOD OUR KING ♪
Jon: BOOM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WOMAN HAS GAME! EITHER WAY IT'S STILL BETTER  THAN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD IF  ROMNEY WON. ♪ FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA ♪  YEAH ♪ [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NAILED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WAS ALL PART AND PARCEL OF  THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'SEL SECOND INAUGURATION. -- OBAMA'S SECOND INAUGURATION. YESTERDAY'S EVENTS HAD  EVERYTHING A NEW INAUG-OFILE  WOULD LOVE. THE LARGE CROWDS, THE SWEARING  IN, THE WALKING, THE WAVING, A  FAIRYTALE STYLE BALL AND THE GRANDEST OF AMERICAN TRADITIONS  THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER. TODAY'S CELEBRATED BARACK OBAMA  BREAKOUT STAR WAS NONE OTHER  THAT CHARLES SCHUMER WHO HOSTED THE FEST ACTIVITIES. HE WAS ABLE TO ENHANCE THE RIT  YIMENT WITH SHAH BAT SERVICE  ANNOUNCEMENTS.
THE THEME OF THIS YEAR'S  INAUGURAL IS FAITH IN AMERICA'S  FUTURE.
Jon: SPEAKING OF FAITH, I  BELIEVE WE SHOULD AT THIS TIME  THANK CANTOR LONESTEIN'S LOVELY WIFE, HANNAH, FOR THE DELICIOUS  TREATS AWAITING US DOWNSTAIRS. [ LAUGHTER ] FOLLOWING THE SER -- [ LAUGHTER ] BUT OF COURSE INAUGURATION DAY  ISN'T ALL CEREMONY. AT ITS CENTER IS THE PRESIDENT'S  SPEECH WHERE HE ARTICULATES THE  VISION OF GOVERNANCE IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE EARLY REVIEWS.
MARVELOUS SPEECH BRAVE AND  BOLD.
HISTORIC SPEECH.
AUDACIOUS SPEECH.
A HUGE PROPOSAL FOR AMERICA.
Jon: IT'S A CALL TO ACTION  LIKE J.F.K.'S ASK NOT WHAT YOUR  COUNTRY TO K- DO FOR YOU OR FDR, THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR  IS FEAR ITSELF OR JIMMY CARTER'S  SOMEWHAT INEXPLICABLE "SHE'S A BRICKHOUSE SHE'S MIGHTY MIGHTY." [ LAUGHTER ] TRUE IT WAS AN INAUGURAL SPEECH  BEFORE YOU IT WAS -- [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S LISTEN TO BARACK OBAMA.
FIDEL AT THIS TO OUR FOUNDING  PRINCIPLES REQUIRES NEW  RESPONSES TO NEW CHALLENGES. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST DO  THESE THINGS TOGETHER. AS ONE NATION AND ONE PEOPLE.
Jon: YES, BARACK OBAMA,  RELIEF FROM THE BURDEN OF  SEEKING ELECTIONS DARES TO SUGGEST PUBLICLY THAT A  GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE, FOR  THE PEOPLE AND OF THE PEOPLE COULD BE AT TIMES HELPFUL TO  THOSE PEOPLE. RADICAL MOTHER (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] THEN HE THREW DOWN THE MIC I'M  OUT, BITCH! [ LAUGHTER ] BEFORE I GO OF MR. PRESIDENT,  WHAT HAVE WE DONE TOGETHER.
WE LEARNED THAT NO UNION  SURVIVED ON LIBERTY AND EQUALITY  COULD SURVIVE HALF TRUTHS.
Jon: TOGETHER WE ENDED  SLAVERY.
WE RESOLVED THAT A GREAT  NATION MUST CARE FOR THE  VULNERABLE.
Jon: TOGETHER WE GAVE  DIGNITY TO OUR ELDERLY AND OUR  POOR.
WE DETERMINED THAT A MD YEARN  ECONOMY REQUIRES RAILROADS AND  HIGHWAYS.
Jon: TOGETHER WE BUILT THE  JERSEY TURNPIKE. I LOOKED IT'S NOT THE SAME  LEVEL, THEN THEY CREATED THE  EX-PASS. NOT EVERYBODY GOT ONE. IF YOU ARE GOING FROM SEE CAUCUS  TO BORDENTOWN, WHAT ARE YOU  GOING TO DO? TAKE THE GARDEN STATE? IT'S ABSURD. IT'S BIG IS WHAT I'M SAYING. WE ENDED SLAVERY AND BUILT  ROADING TO. MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU  HAVE US DO NEXT?
WE WILL RESPOND TO THE THREAT  OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SOME MAY DENY THE OVERWHELMINGLY  JUDGMENT OF SCIENCE BUT NONE CAN  AVOID THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE FIRES, CRIPPLING DROUGHT AND  MORE POWERFUL STORMS.
Jon: OH (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] WE DON'T NEED A PRESIDENT WE  NEED THE LAST AIR VENDOR. BUT PERHAPS THE LINE THAT GOT  THE MOST ATTENTION IN OBAMA'S  SPEECH WAS THIS ONE.
WE, THE PEOPLE, DECLARED  TODAY THAT -- DECLARE TODAY THAT  THE MOST EVIDENT OF TRUTHS THAT ALL OF RUSS CREATED EQUAL IS THE  STAR THAT GUIDES US STILL. JUST AS IT GUIDED OUR FORBEARERS  THROUGH SENECA FALLS AND THE  SELMA AND STONEWALL.
Jon: I BELIEVE IT'S THE  FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT HAS NAME  CHECKED A GAY BAR AT HIS  INAUGURATION. OTHER THAN RUTHER FORD B. HAYES  TALKING ABOUT WORK TEG LOADED  MUSKET. PUT SOME PANTS ON HAYES. SO NOW TO THE REACT. THE NETWORK WILL HAVE TO TALK  ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF COVERAGE  MSNBC.
MASSIVE CROWD IN WASHINGTON  TODAY.
Jon: FOX.
MUCH SMALLER CROWD THAN FOUR  YEARS AGO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT'S IT. IT'S WOODSTOCK. IT'S WOODSTOCKST 99. SEIZING THE MOMENT.
JUST A NOTE ON WHAT YOU SAW  THE FIRST LADY WEARING. WE'RE TOLD IT'S A THOM BROWN  COAT AND DRESS.
CUSTOM MADE.
IT COULD BE UPWARDS OF  $3,000.
I THINK THE TRAGEDY IS THAT  SHE HAS TO GIVE THAT OUTFIT AWAY  TO THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES.
Jon: SO YOU'VE JUST  (bleep) GIVEN UP S. THAT WHAT  YOU ARE TELLING US. THE FASHION IS TALKS ABOUT  THE --
THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENT IN  THAT SPEECH AMONG MANY WAS WHEN  HE MENTIONED THE WORD STONEWALL.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT  STONEWALL.
STONEWALL RIGHTS THE  FLASHPOINT OF GAY RIGHTS  MOVEMENT.
IT'S A BARROOM BRAWL IN  GREENWICH VILLAGE IN 1969. DOES IT BELONG IN THE  PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL.
Jon: FROM THE LOSING SIDE  OF HISTORY I'M PAT BUCHANAN. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S LAUGH IT UP, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN WITH CLOSING  ARGUMENTS.
I WAS AMAZED AT BEAUTIFULLY  HE ARTICULATED A PROGRESSIVE  VISION OF AMERICA.
THE MOST PARTISAN AND  DIVISIVE INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
DO YOU KNOW WHO THE DESIGNER  WAS ON THAT?
I DO, ANDERSON.
ALL THAT RHETORICAL AFFECTS  THAT HE HAS THE POETRY.
IT WAS NOT REALLY POETRY IT  WAS PROSE.
CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE  GOWN. HI, ANN. THIS IS --  THIS IS REMARKABLE THAT FOUR  YEARS LATER SHE WOULD CHOOSE  JASON WU AGAIN. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, IT'S REMARKABLE  ALL RIGHT. ONCE AGAIN IS WHAT IS MORE  REMARKABLE TO ME IS HOW EVEN  WHEN ARTICULATING HIS MOST LIBERAL IDEAL HOW DIFFERENT  ACTUAL BARACK OBAMA IS FROM THE  BIZARRO BOOGIEMAN EMPTY CHAIR OBAMA WHO LIVES ONLY IN THE  MINDS OF HIS OPPONENTS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO IS AN  AVOWED SECULARIST.
GOING AFTER THE GUNS.
TAKING AWAY GUNS. ATTACKING CHRISTIANS WHO BELIEVE  IN GUN AND GOD.
OBAMA IS AT WAR WITH ALL  RELIGION IN ANY PUBLIC PLACE,  ANY PUBLIC SQUARE ANY PUBLIC  SCHOOL.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL IT'S NICE  TO KNOW THAT ROY ROGERS WIFE IS  STILL OUT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] SECOND OF ALL, HOW WOULD AN  AVOWED ANTI-GUN SECULARIST  CELEBRATE THIS MOMENTUM VICTORY? -- MOMENTOUS VICTORY IF. ♪--  VICTORY?
FREEDOM IS SAY GIFT FROM GOD.
GOD BLESS THESE UNITED  STATES.
IN JESUS NAME AND THE NAME OF  ALL THAT IS HOLY.
LET US JOIN TOGETHER IN  PRAYER.
LET US PRAY HEAVENLY FATHER.
JESUS CHRIST, MY LORD AND  SAVIOR.
MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
WE PRAY FOR YOUR BLESSING.
L'CHAIM.
Jon: WHO LET THAT GUY IN  THERE? THA
