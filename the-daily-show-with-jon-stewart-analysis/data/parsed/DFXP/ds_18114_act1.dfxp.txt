FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
HELLO THERE. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. I'M JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART IS STILL NOT HERE. HE IS CURRENTLY LIVING OUT A  LIVE-ACTION LORD OF THE RINGS  ROLE-PLAYING EXPERIENCE DEEP IN THE NEW ZEALAND WINDERNESS WHERE  I BELIEVE HE'S SERVING IN THE  NAVY THERE. HE'S HAVING FUN. THE POINT IS HE'S HAVING FUN. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CREATOR  OF SOME OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS ON  TELEVISION INCLUDING THE THICK OF IT. ALAN PARTRIDGE. ARMANDO IS HERE WITH US.   ( APPLAUSE )   SO YESTERDAY WE DISCUSSED THE  NEWS THAT THE N.S.A. HAS BEEN  TRACKING OUR CALL RECORDS, EMAILS, EVEN OUR PERSONALIZED  BIRTHDAY CAKES. LOOK, COMPLAIN ALL YOU WANT  ABOUT THAT BUT IT'S HOW WE  CALBIN LADEN. SURPRISE. SURPRISE! TONIGHT, WE CONTINUE OUR  COVERAGE OF THE N.S.A. SCANDAL  WITH OUR ONGOING SEGMENT "IT MEANS THE N.S.A. CAN READ THE  TIME OFF YOUR [BLEEP] WRIST  WATCH. ".
YOU WON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST. EAH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOWSER. THE GOOD NEWS, "YOU'RE NOT  PARANOID" IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY  BLANKETS. COWER UNDER THEM FOR THE  ILLUSION OF SAFETY. BLANKETS. SO FAR, WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE  N.S.A. PROGRAM IS TECHNICALLY  LEGAL, PROBABLY USEFUL, AND YET HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO GREAT  HARM. THEY'RE LIKE BATH SALTS. GOOD TO RELAX IN. LESS GOOD TO SHOVE INTO YOUR  FACE. THAT IS WHY IT HAS BEEN SO HARD  TO ARTICULATE WHAT IS UNSETTLING  ABOUT THIS STORY. EVEN FOR OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED  ORATORS.
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, SOME  CONSERVATIVE SENATOR CALLS  TRICKSY AT THE HOT LICKS MASSAGE PARLOR, ALL RIGHT? GUESS WHO KNOWS IT. TRICKSY HAS THE NUMBER. THE SENATOR HAS A NUMBER. THE GUY GOES LIKE THIS. WHOA! AND GIVES IT OUT TO SOME WEBSITE  THAT COULD HURT THE SENATOR.
WHAT? BE HONEST WITH ME. HAVE YOU BUILT A TIME MACHINE SO  YOU CAN GO TO BRUSSELS IN THE  1930s? ACTUALLY THAT REMINDS OF AN IDEA  FOR A MOVIE "WHOREHOUSE TIME  MACHINE."  HE MET THE WOMAN OF HIS DREAMS. SADLY, THAT WOMAN WAS HIS  GRANDMOTHER. OBVIOUSLY WHEN SUCH A HUGE STORY  BREAKS, THERE IS GOING TO BE A  RUSH TO TAKE A SIDE. FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM A MEMBER  OF TEAM "EVERYBODY CALM DOWN."
THESE TWO PROGRAMS CONNECTED  BY THE N.S.A., ANYTHING BOTHER  YOU ABOUT THIS?
NO, NOT REALLY. OH, THAT'S IT. WE'RE DONE THEN. I THOUGHT IT WAS COMPLICATED. IT TURNS OUT TO BE SIMPLE  BECAUSE NOBODY UNDERSTANDS  SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY BETTER THAN CANTANKEROUS OLD MEN. ARE YOU SURE THAT WE DON'T WANT  TO ASK SOMEONE YOUNGER THAN  DIRT? IS THIS EVEN WORTH HAVING A  DISCUSSION OVER.
I DO BELIEVE THAT IF THIS WAS  SEPTEMBER 12, 2001, WE MIGHT NOT  BE HAVING THE ARGUMENT THAT WE ARE HAVING TODAY.
YEAH. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT,  IS IT? THE STANDARD CANNOT BE WHAT  DECISION WOULD WE MAKE ON OUR  MOST VULNERABLE AND PANICKED  DAY. WHAT WOULD I HAVE FOR DINNER ON  SEPTEMBER 12. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL PROBABLY JUST SKIP IT AND  BOMB IT OUT OF FEAR INSTEAD. SO LET'S DO THAT FOREVER. AND LEAVING THE OPPOSITION AS  MASCOT OF "TEAM EVERYONE FREAK  OUT" WAS RAND PAUL.
GET A WARRANT. GO AFTER A TERRORIST OR A MURDER  OR A RAPIST BUT DON'T TROLL  THROUGH A BILLION PHONE RECORDS  EVERYDAY. IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, INVADES  OUR PRIVACY. I'M GOING TO BE SEEING IF I CAN  CHALLENGE THIS AT THE SUPREME  COURT LEVEL.
RAND -- IF THAT IS YOUR REAL  NAME, AND I JUST REFUSE TO  BELIEVE THAT IT IS -- I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU ARE THE RIGHT  PERSON TO LEAD THIS PARTICULAR  CHALLENGE. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT WHEN THE  JUSTICES RULED OBAMA CARE  CONSTITUTIONAL LAST YEAR, RAND PAUL SAID JUST BECAUSE A COUPLE  PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME COURT  DECLARE SOMETHING TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL DOES NOT MAKE IT  SO. NOW, HERE'S THE THING ABOUT  RAND. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT. FOR A START IT WASN'T A COUPLE. IT WAS FIVE. WHICH IS TECHNICALLY TWO COUPLES  PLUS ONE. OR ONE COUPLE AND A THREE-SOME. OR A MAJORITY OF THE JUSTICES. BUT HERE'S WHAT REALLY HURTS  ABOUT THIS STORY. IT MAKES US PICK BETWEEN LIBERTY  AND CONVENIENCE. I LOVE MY PRIVACY, BUT I ALSO  LOVE TO BUY MOVIE TICKETS ON THE  TOILET. DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE. DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE. IT'S TOO HARD. I WANT BOTH. I WANT BOTH SO BAD. DO THE ADVANCEMENTS TECHNOLOGY  GIVES WORTH HAVING INVADE OUR  LIVES. THEORY.
YES, JOHN. YES, JOHN.
IS CONVENIENCE WORTH THE  SACRIFICE IN PRIVACY?
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S PRONOUNCED  PRIVACY.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THAT IS NOT REALLY THE QUESTION  THAT I ASKED.
BUT IT IS THE ANSWER YOU  NEEDED.
OKAY. AND, YES, CONVENIENCE IS  WORTH THE SACRIFICE OF LIBERTY. NOW PLEASE NEVER ASK ME ABOUT  THAT AGAIN.
SIRI, ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU NERVOUS?
JOHN, HAVE TO GO. CAN'T TALK NOW.
SIRI, WHO WERE YOU TALK TO  GO?
OH, HEY, PRISM. NOBODY. JUST HELPING SAM JACKSON MAKE  GAZPACHO.   (SCREAMING).
SIRI, ONE MORE QUESTION. IS IT STILL RAINING OUTSIDE? IS IT RAINING OUTSIDE? NOW, TO KNOW WHICH SIDE... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, THERE'S NO SIDES. THERE'S NO SIDE. NOW, TO KNOW WHICH SIDE YOU'RE  ON HERE REALLY COMES DOWN TO  WHETHER YOU TRUST THE  GOVERNMENT. FOR SOME PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS  GOING TO BE A RESOUNDING YES.
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME ONE BIT  FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY  ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE  TRYING TO DO IS FIND OUT WHAT  TERRORIST GROUPS WE KNOW ABOUT AND INDIVIDUALS AND WHO THE HELL  THEY'RE CALLING.
I MEAN I'M A SOUTHERN WHITE  CRISTIAN GENTLEMAN. NO ONE HAS EVER SUSPECTED ME OF  TERRORISM. AND I THINK MY PRIVILEGED  CIRCUMSTANCES ACCURATELY SPEAK  FOR ALL OF Y'ALL. NOW, CAN I FIX YOU SOME SWEET  TEA. IT'S MY FAVORITE DRINK SO I  PRESUME IT'S YOURS. I THINK WE'RE ALL NOW PAINFULLY  AWARE THAT A SOUTHERN ACCENT IS  NOT A CLUB IN MY BAG. LINDSEY GRAHAM TRUSTS THE  GOVERNMENT COMPLETELY. AND BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE  ALLOWED TO GATHER WHATEVER  INFORMATION NECESSARY TO KEEP INNOCENT AMERICANS SAFE. NO EXCEPTIONS. APART FROM ONE.
SOME OF THE NEW LAWS REQUIRE  PEOPLE WHO OWN AN AR15 TO  REGISTER THEIR GUN. UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE  GOING TO REQUIRE UNIVERSAL  REGISTRATION OF WEAPONS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A  UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND SYSTEM, THE  NEXT LOGICAL STEP IS REGISTERING WEAPONS, TO HAVE A DATABASE TO  WORK OFF OF. I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG  SOLUTION.
OF COURSE IT IS. OF COURSE. GUNS ARE ONE THING, BUT PHONE  CALLS ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO GO  UNCHECKED. THINK ABOUT IT. REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. SOME MANIAC COULD BE CALLING  ABOUT GOING ON A SHOOTING SPREE. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ACTUALLY  MEANS. I THINK WE CAN CALL IT AN 11:09  P.M. ON JUNE... I MADE THESE. I CAN'T DO THAT. AT 11:09 ON JUNE 11, THE SECOND  AMENDMENT HAS WON THE BILL OF  RIGHTS. IT HAS DEFEATED ALL THE OTHER  AMENDMENTS. WHICH, OF COURSE, IT DID WHEN  YOU THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S THE ONLY AMENDMENT WITH A [BLEEP]. IT ACTUALLY SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT  TRACKING YOUR PHONE THERE IS  ONLY ONE SOLUTION. GUN PHONES. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW, PUNK? WELL, CAN YOU? WE'LL BE RIGHT
