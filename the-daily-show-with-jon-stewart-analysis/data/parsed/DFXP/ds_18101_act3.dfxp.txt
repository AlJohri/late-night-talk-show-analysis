(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT, HIS NEW FILM IS 'STAR  TREK INTO DARKNESS".
LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT'S  HAPPENING HERE. YOU ARE A CRIMINAL. I WATCHED YOU MURDER INNOCENT  MEN AND WOMEN. I WAS AUTHORIZED TO END YOU AND  THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU ARE  STILL ALIVE IS BECAUSE I AM ALLOWING IT. SO SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
CAPTAIN, ARE YOU GOING TO  PUNCH ME AGAIN OVER AND OVER  UNTIL YOUR ARM WEAKENS? CLEARLY YOU WANT TO SO, TELL ME,  WHY DID YOU AND I MEET ALONE?
Jon: I THINK THAT'S THE BAD  GUY. (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  J.J. ABRAMS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK.
Jon: I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY  MAN. I'M ASSUMING DURING THE TIME OF  THIS INTERVIEW YOU WILL COME UP  WITH, WRITE AND SELL ANOTHER TELEVISION PROGRAM. LAUGH.
(LAUGHS).
Jon: YOU'RE A VERY BUSY  MAN. THIS "STAR TREK" IS DARK YET  ENTERTAINING YET VIVID.
YOU'RE SCARING THE HELL OUT  OF ME. STOP IT!
Jon: THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE  GOING TO DO THIS TO THE STARR  TRUCK AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO DO THE "STAR WARS" MOVIE. YOU'RE GOING TO DO BOTH, DO YOU  REALIZE --
YEAH, I GET -- YES. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO  GO TO THESE CONVENTIONS ANYMORE,  I'M JUST GOING TO SIT ON YOUR  LAP. (LAUGHTER)
THEN I MIGHT NOT DO "STAR  WARS."
Jon: (LAUGHS)
NO, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE --
Jon: INCREDIBLE.
Jon: .
A SURREAL THRILL. A TOTAL HONOR.
Jon: DO YOU DELINEATE IN  YOUR MIND -- "STAR WARS" --
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT. THEY ARE JUST SO DIFFERENT.
Jon: ONE FELT LIKE IT WAS  SORT OF AN ALLEGORY OF MODERN  SOCIETY SET IN THE A FUTURISTIC SPACE ENVIRONMENT WHEREAS THE  OTHER WAS AN ALLEGORY OF MODERN  SOCIETY SET IN A SPACE THING IN THE PAST. SO THEY ARE DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER)
THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY  DIFFERENT. THEY'RE -- SPACE, RIGHT? STARS.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
BUT IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SAYING  "YOU'RE DOING ANOTHER MOVIE WITH  BIPEDS AND THEY THEY LIVE IN STRUCTURES."
Jon: I ALWAYS THOUGHT "STAR  WARS" HAD A WESTERN SENSIBILITY.
IT WAS A SAMURAI WESTERN. I NEVER LIKED "STAR TREK" WHEN I  WAS A KID. GROWING UP I COULDN'T GET INTO  IT. MY FRIENDS LOVED IT AND I WOULD  TRY. I WOULD WATCH EPISODES AND IT  FELT TOO PHILOSOPHICAL FOR ME. SOME OF THE WRITERS LOVED "STAR  TREK."  I WAS NOT A FAN. MY PRODUCING PARTNER NEVER SAW  IT SO WHEN WE WERE ALL HAPPY IT  FELT LIKE THAT WAS THE WAY TO  GO. THIS MOVIE THAT WE DID, THE GOAL  WAS TO MAKE A MOVIE FOR  MOVIEGOERS NOT JUST "STAR TREK"  FANS. SO IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT, YOU  CAN SEE THIS MOVIE.
Jon: THE INTERESTING THING  TO ME WAS I STOPPED LISTENING TO  YOU WHEN YOU STARTED SAYING YOU DIDN'T LIKE "STAR TREK."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED  BECAUSE YOUR MOUTH WAS MOVING  AFTER THAT SO I'M ASSUMING YOU  APOLOGIZED.
AS I WAS SAYING AND I WAS  SAYING THAT YOU AND YOUR KIND --
Jon: (LAUGHS)
--WERE MUCH SMARTER THAN I  WAS. I COULDN'T GET IT. SO WE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK FOR  PEOPLE LIKE ME AND PEOPLE LIKE  YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THE  DIFFERENCE IS?
Jon: BACK THEN -- I'M OLDER  THAN YOU ARE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
Jon: AREN'T I? I AM 50.
YOU ARE OLDER THAN I AM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR NOT  KNOWING THAT, THOUGH. THANK YOU FOR BEING LIKE, WHOA,  THAT'S SOME HARD LIVING. BUT "STAR TREK," "TWILIGHT ZONE"  THERE WAS A VERY OVERT EFFORT TO  PUT THAT KIND OF PHILOSOPHY AND THAT SORT OF IDEA THAT WE WERE  PROCESSING THE DIFFICULTIES OF  OUR WORLD --
YES, SOME OF THE SAME  WRITERS, BY THE WAY, "TWILIGHT  ZONE."
Jon: AND IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE  FOR SOME REASON "STAR TREK"  NEVER CLICKED ON ME UNTIL I WORKED ON IT AND FELL IN LOVE  WITH IT.
Jon: SO YOU WENT BACK AND  WATCHED --
AND UNDERSTANDING THE  CHARACTERS, THE ARCHETYPES, THE  DYNAMICS. I APPRECIATED IT MORE.
Jon: AT THE TIME YOU WATCH  IT AND ON THE SURFACE IT WAS  GOOFY BUT THEN YOU WOULD TURN AROUND AND BE LIKE "RACISM IS  WRONG."  YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHY, BUT KIRK  MADE LOVE TO A GREEN WOMAN AND YOU'RE LIKE "WE SHOULD LIVE  TOGETHER IN PEACE."  (LAUGHTER)
BUT WITH "STAR WARS" I ALWAYS  FELT LIKE IT WAS FOCUSED ON THIS  MUCH MORE GOOD AND EVIL AS IT WAS REPRESENTED BY COMBATANTS. DUELS.
WELL, I THINK "STAR TREK" WAS  OVERTLY A KIND OF ALLEGORY OF  TODAY WHERE "STAR WARS" ALWAYS FELT LIKE IT WAS A MORE EPIC --  IT DIDN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE SCIENCE  FICTION TO ME WHICH SOUNDS  CRAZY. BUT "STAR WARS" NEVER FELT LIKE  A SCI-FI THING WHERE "STAR TREK"  DID AND WE TRIED TO MAKE A "STAR TREK" MOVIE IN THIS ONE THAT  DOESN'T SUFFER FROM KIND OF --  THE ORIGINAL SHOW WAS STATIC BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO  GO ANYWHERE OR DO ANYTHING AND  WE HAVE SLIGHTLY LARGER BUDGET. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT  THE ROCKS ON YOUR PLANETS ARE  NOT NECESSARILY STYROFOAM.
THEY'RE REAL ROCKS.
Jon: THAT WAS ALWAYS MY  FAVORITE PART OF "STAR TREK"  WHEN THEY'D SAY "LANDSLIDE" AND THEY'D COME DOWN LIKE FLOATING  ON A WIND AS IT CAME DOWN, A  GIANT ROCK. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOW  YOU'RE GOING TO APPROACH "STAR  WARS" OR ARE YOU NOT DELVING INTO IT YET?
IT'S SO EARLY ON I HAVE THAT  NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT OTHER THAN  IT'S EXCITING.
Jon: DO YOU WANT TO STAY  AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT ON THE WEB  OR -- YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO  SOMEWHERE.
I WOULD LOVE TO HANG OUT AND  NOT DISCUSS IT.
Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLE  BIT MORE ABOUT "STAR TREK INTO  DARKNESS," IT WILL BE IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. J.J. AB
