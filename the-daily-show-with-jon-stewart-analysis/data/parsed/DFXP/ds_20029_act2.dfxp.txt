(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VERY HEAVY AND EMOTIONAL FIRST ACT. YOU KNOW, BUT BRACE YOURSELVES. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO THE HEART OF DARKNESS, THAT'S RIGHT, PIGS. NO, DON'T LOOK AWAY. LOOK INTO THE FACE OF HORROR. LOOK AT IT! LOOK AT HORROR'S TINY GALOSHES, ALL FOUR OF THEM. YOU KNOW, LAST MONTH WE TALKED ABOUT A NEW JERSEY STATE BILL THAT WOULD BAN PIG GESTATIONS CRATES THAT WERE UNBELIEVABLY SMALL. THEY COULDN'T MOVE, THEY COULDN'T TURN TARND. YEAH, AWW. WELL, APPARENTLY ONE OF THE INTERESTING QUIRKS OF ANIMALS IS THAT THEY LIKE TO MOVE AROUND. THE BILL PASSED THE NEW JERSEY LEGISLATURE EASILY SO FINALLY I HAVE TO IMAGINE IT IS GOING TO BE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS FOR THE PIGS IN NEW JERSEY.
TODAY GOVERNOR CHRISTIE VETOED A CONTROVERSIAL BAN ON CERTAIN PIG CRATES CALLING THE BILL PARTISAN POLITICS.
WHAT? WHAT THE -- WHAT? HE VETOED IT? CONTROVERSIAL BILL, PARTISAN POLITICS? THE BILL PASSED THE NEW JERSEY STATE ASSEMBLY 53-13. THE NEW JERSEY STATE SENATE, 32-1. WHEN DID THE THRESHOLD FOR NONPARTISAN BECOME UNANIMOUS. THIS BILL WAS FAVORED BY 93% OF NEW JERSIANS. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE IN THE STATE THAT GETS THAT KIND OF SUPPORT. GOING FOR CHEESE STEAKS DOWN THE SHORE WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEIN, ONLY 86%. TRACK SUITS, TOP-OUT AT 88%. AND I THINK YOU KNOW IN NEW JERSEY, IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE COMFORTABLE. SO UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT BILL PARTISAN OR CONTROVERSIAL?
CHRISTIE HAS GOTTEN PRESSURE FROM IOWA'S   GOVERNOR TO NOT SIGN THE BILL.
IOWA, OF COURSE, IS HOME TO THE FIRST IN THE NATION PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUSES AND ALSO ABOUT 20 MILLION PIGS.
SO THAT IS WHY IT IS CONTROVERSIAL AND PARTISAN. YOUR CHOICE WAS EITHER LISTENING TO THE NEARLY UNANIMOUS VOICE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED YOU OR SAYING [BLEEP] THEM, AND KOWTOWING TO A STATE A THOUSAND MILES AWAY IN EXCHANGE FOR REALLY, LET'S BE HONEST, THE SLIMMEST CHANCE OF POLITICAL GAIN IN A CAUCUS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN. SIR, SIR, YOU'RE NOT WINNING. YOU COULD RIDE INTO SIOUX CITY ON A TRACTOR MADE OF CORN WHILE [BLEEP] A "FIELD OF DREAMS" DVD, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN. I MEAN HONESTLY. LET THE PIGS TURN AROUND. I MEAN THE WAY CHRISTIE DECIDED THIS THING, YOU'D THINK, YOU'D THINK WE WERE ON THE PRECIPICE OF PIGS RUNNING AMOK THROUGHOUT SOCIETY. A WOMAN WAS BOOTED FROM HER U.S. AIRWAYS PLANE.
ESCORTED OFF AFTER HER PIG BECAME DISRUPTIVE.
Jon: OH MY GOD, I APOLOGIZE, WE SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO YOU CHRIS CHRISTIE, WILL YOU BE PRESIDENT. YOU'RE LIKE THE SCIENTIST IN A DISASTER MOVIE THAT NO ONE BELIEVED UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT PIGS WERE RUNNING AROUND ON PLANES. SO IF I MAY, WHAT'S WITH THIS MOTHER [BLEEP] PIG ON THIS MOTHER [BLEEP] PLANE.
THE WOMAN STUCK THE 70 POUND POTBELLIED PIG IN A DUFFLE BAG. SHE CALLS HIM HER EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL.
Jon: LOOK, I GET THAT SOME PEOPLE NEED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS, THAT'S FINE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND, YOU'RE PUTTING A PIG IN A DUFFLE BAG AND LAUNCHING IT INTO THE SKY, IF ANYBODY NEEDS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT IN THAT SITUATION, I THINK IT'S THE CREATURE THAT HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS GOING ON. HE'S IN A BAG. HIS EARS ARE POPPING. I THINK YOUR PIG NEEDS HIS OWN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PIG. I THINK-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT,  BY THE WAY, THAT SMALLER PIG APPARENTLY FLIES ALL THE TIME, A LITTLE XANAX, NECK PILLOW, HE'S ALL RIGHT. ALRIGHT, MAYBE PIGS SHOULDN'T BE FLYING BUT THERE HAS TO BE A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN LOCKING PIGS IN TINY CAGES AND LETTING THEM RUN AMOK ON AIRPLANES. SOMETHING THAT COMBINES SPACE WITH ECONOMY, MAYBE THE BACKSEAT OF A FORD FIESTA. FORD FIESTA, KEEP YOUR PIG IN ONE. BUT HOW BAD COULD THE PIG EVEN HAVE BEEN?
ANOTHER PASSENGER SAID THE PIG DIDN'T SMELL SO GOOD. AND THEN IT BECAME INCONTINENT.
AS THE OWNER TRIED TO CLEAN UP THE MESS, THE PIG BEGAN RUNNING BACK AND FORTH.
Jon: YEAH, THIS IS -- THIS IS YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING. IF YOU LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT YOU WILL SEE THE GRAND CANYON, IF YOU LOOK TO YOUR LEFT, YOU WILL SEE A SQUEALING PIG TAKING A PANIC DUMP ON THE DRINK CART. ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT. YOU KNOW WHEN ARE YOU SITTING ON A FLIGHT, WATCHING A [BLEEP] PIG RUN UP AND DOWN THE AISLE, OR WATCHING ANY GOVERNOR [BLEEP] ALL OVER A CHANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING, THAT'S THE TIME YOU JUST WANT SOMEONE TO WALK IN AND SAY --
THAT WILL DO, PIG, THAT WILL DO. (LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
