[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTRESS SHE HAS TWO GREAT NEW MOVIES OUT "HER" AND "AMERICAN HUSTLE".
YOU HAVE THE ACCOUNT NUMBERS.
WE MEANING YOU AND HIM?
YEAH, WE DID IT.
YEAH ME AND THAT GUY.
SHE SHOWED ME.
YOU SHOWED HIM? OUR THING? YOU DID THAT WITHOUT ME? ARE YOU KIDDING?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
Jon: IT'S A REAL GOOD MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME AMY ADAMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: YOU KNOW --
FIRST TIME HERE.
Jon: WE'RE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU HERE. I OCCASIONALLY WILL GET. THEY GIVE ME A LITTLE SCREENER OF THE MOVIE THAT CAN I WATCH. AND A LOT OF TIMES I'LL BE LIKE SURE, YEAH, I'LL DO THAT BUT I DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THIS ONE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO 1:00 IN THE MORNING, MAN "AMERICAN HUSTLE" IS A GREAT MOVIE.
IT WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE, YES IF YOU START WATCHING IT.
Jon: IT'S PHENOMENAL. IT'S GOT THIS ENSEMBLE CAST.
CHRISTIAN BALE, BRADLEY COOPER, JEREMY RENNER AND JENNIFER LAWRENCE AMAZING IN THE FILM.
Jon: AND YOURSELF.
AND ME.
Jon: JENNIFER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN ON THIS PROGRAM.
I WATCHED THAT. SHE WAS SO FUNNY IF I DID THAT IT WOULD BE LIKE I WAS ON PILLS. SHE PULLS IT OFF. IT'S NOT A DIG ON HER. I WISH I COULD PULL THAT OFF.
Jon: WHEN YOU WATCH HER INTERVIEW DOES IT SEEM LIKE A YOUNG --
HELEN MIRREN?
Jon: YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON WHO ALSO SEES IT. NO ONE THAT YOUNG SHOULD BE THAT GOOD AT SOMETHING. WHEN YOU ARE THAT YOUNG YOU SHOULD SUCK AT THINGS.
THE ONLY THING I WAS GOOD AT BEING WAS A MESS AT HER AGE. BEII WAS REALLY GOOD AT BEING A MESS.
Jon: YOU AND I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.
I THINK SO.
THIS FILM MUST BE  FOR AN ACTOR A THANKSGIVING FEAST. DAVID O'RUSSELL, THE DIALOG IS SO VIVID AND CRACKLING BUT MAN ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
IT IS. IT DOESN'T STOP. WORKING WITH DAVID IT HAS THAT ENERGY. I DON'T THEY IF YOU HAVE HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HOW HE WORKS. HE STANDS LIKE RIGHT OFF THE CAMERA AND YELLS AT YOU. HE DOES -- HE IS ENCOURAGING BUT -- [LAUGHTER] -- AT TIMES BUT HE ALSO LIKE HAS A BULLHORN SOMETIMES FROM OUTSIDE THE CAR.
Jon: NO!
YES, IT'S AMAZING.
Jon: WILL HE YELL THINGS LIKE GOOD JOB!
NO, NOT TYPICALLY. HE YELLS SUGGESTIONS LIKE NOW TRY IT LIKE THIS OR DO THE LINE READING AND WHILE THE CAMERA IS ROLLING. IT CREATES BEAUTIFUL CHAOS THAT CREATES ELECTRIC PERFORMANCES AND FOCUS AND YOU END UP WITH THESE PERFORMANCES.
Jon: HOW DO YOU KEEP THE PACE OF IT? I IMAGINE -- IT LOOKED TO ME WITH THE PACE OF READINGS YOU ARE BLOWING THROUGH 8-10 PAGES OF DIALOG.
YEAH, EASY. HE DELIVERED I FORGET HOW MANY PAGES BUT IT WAS TWICE THE LENGTH OF A NORMAL SCRIPT AND WE HAD TO SHOOT IT IN 40 DAYS. IT WAS PRETTY HIGH ENERGY, HIGH OCTANE BUT IT MATCHES THE PACE OF FILM AND THAT COMES ACROSS IN THE END.
Jon: IT'S SO -- BEAUTIFULLY SHOT. DURING THE 70s. HAVING BEEN ALIVE DURING THE AB SCRAM TRIAL AND EVERYTHING THAT WENT ALONG WITH IT IT TAKES YOU BACK.
DO YOU REMEMBER IT?
Jon: OH, GOD YES. IT WAS COMING ON THE HEELS OF WATERGATE. NOT ON THE HEELS BUT IN THAT SAME ERA.
THERE WAS A LOSS OF INNOCENCE, RIGHT, A LITTLE BIT?
Jon: ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.
YOU WERE 23, RIGHT?
Jon: AMY I WANTED TO BELIEVE SO DESPERATELY.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
Jon: DID YOU GO BACK AND VIEW ANYTHING FROM THAT TIME?
I WATCHED ACTORS AND ACTRESSES FROM THAT TIME. MY CHARACTER PUTS ON AN ENGLISH ACCENT. SHE PRETENDS TO BE BRITISH. I WAS WATCHING JULIE CHRISTIE. I WAS HOPING FOR A SIDE BY SIDE SAYING WE LOOKED ALIKE.
Jon: YOU DO.
I REALLY DON'T BUT I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU SAW THAT IN ME.
Jon: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE AUDIENCE KNOWS THAT. I LOOK JUST LIKE JULIE CHRISTIE.
Jon: EXACTLY AND I WARREN BEATTY AND TOGETHER WE'RE FILMING SHAMPOO.
WOOHOO.
Jon: TO DO THIS AND SPIKE JONZE AND HER AND WORK WITH THESE DIRECTORS ALL AT ONCE WILL YOU EVER BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO CRUDDY DIRECTORS? YOU ARE AT THIS LEVEL ANY DIRECTOR YOU WORK WITH TO LIVE UP TO THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT?
I LIKE THE CHALLENGE. I CHALLENGE ANY CRUDDY DIRECTOR OUT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S DO A BAD FILM.
Jon: YOU DELIVER IN AN ENORMOUS WAY. YOUR PERFORMANCE IS -- BOY, IS IT BEAUTIFUL TO WATCH. ALL THE ACTORS.
IT'S FANTASTIC.
Jon: I WOULD WATCH IT WITH A BOX OF JUNIOR MINTS. THAT'S HOW I DID IT.
JUNIOR MINTS, POPCORN SPRITE.
Jon: I OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO GET DIABETES BUT I JUST HAD THE JUNIOR MINTS BUT I'LL TRY YOUR SPEED BALL.
ALL RIGHT.
Jon: "AMERICAN HUSTLE IT'S IN THE THEATERS ON DECEMBER 20. HER OPENS IN SELECT CITIES DECEMBER 18.
