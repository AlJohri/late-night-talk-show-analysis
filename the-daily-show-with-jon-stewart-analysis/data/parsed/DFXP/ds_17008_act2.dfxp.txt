Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO LIBYA, CONGRATULATIONS, A FREE COUNTRY. WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR FREEDOM AND THEIR DEMOCRACY, WE DON'T KNOW. WILL THEY BE MORE OF AN AMERICAN ALLY, THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE. WHAT WILL THE NEW LIBYA LOOK LIKE? BACK IN MARCH WE RAN A PIECE, JOHN OLIVER SAT DOWN WITH THE MAN WHO NOW BECOMES THE NEW LIBYAN GOVERNMENT'S  AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON SO WE THOUGHT LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK, IF YOU WILL.
ALLY ALI AUJOLI WAS THE LIBYAN AMBASSADOR FOR THE UNITEDDED STATES. HE WORKED FOR QADDAFI FOR 40 YEARS UNTIL-TO-WOKES AGO WHEN HE RESIGNED IN PROTEST  TO WORK WITH THE REBELS.
QADDAFI MADE IT VERY EASY FOR ME TO QUIT HIS REGIME AFTER HE WHAT HE DID TO  LIBYANS, I FEEL LIKE FIRST TIME I CAN SAY WHAT I LIKE, WHAT I BELIEVE.
DO YOU THINK YOU ACTED A LITTLE HASTILY. YOU ONLY GAVE HIM 40 YEARS.
WELL, I DON'T WORK FOR QADDAFI. I WORKED-- WORKED FOR LIBYA.
RIGHT.
QADDAFI, I DON'T KNOW HIM VERY WELL. I MET HIM MAYBE TWO TIMES, AND WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
QADDAFI IS ONE OF THE MOST ECCENTRIC DEATH-- IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS LEATHER PHRASED UKRAINIAN NURSE LOVING LUNATIC HAS BEEN IN POWER SINCE 1969.
PEOPLE MUST ASK YOU ALL THE TIME, WHAT IS QADDAFI LIKE.
QADDAFI IS-- IS A STRANGE PERSON.
I GET IT MYSELF. WHAT IS JON STEWART LIKE, AND I TELL PEOPLE HE'S  [BLEEP] CRAZY.
YOU CAN USE THE SAME EXPRESSION WITH QADDAFI, I GUESS.
RIGHT, WE BOTH WORK FOR CHARISMATIC, DICTATORIAL FIGURE FIGURES WHO DON'T  LIKE TO LEAVE THEIR ROMS UNLESS IT'S TO GO ON TV. THEY'RE BOTH A DECTED TO THE A DOLEATION OF CLOWNS. THEY BOTH LOOK REALLY WEIRD UP CLOSE, THEY BOTH LIKE JEWISH JOKES. PROBABLY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS.
THIS MAN WITH NO PRINCIPLESES. YOU KNOW-- QADDAFI SAID I OWN YOU OR I KILL YOU.
S THIS'S JON'S BASICALLY THE SAME.
OVER THE YEARS LEBBIA HAS BECOME KNOWN FOR THE LOCKER BOW BOMBINGS, SPORTING  MURDEROUS DICTATORS AND TERRORIST -- TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND OF COURSE ILLEGAL PLUTONIUM DOLES. FOR THIS COUNTRY TO WROTE A NEW CHAPTER IT WILL HAVE TO BE REBUILT FROM THE GROUND UP.
WE NEED TO REBRAND LIBYA. IF THERE IS-- BECAUSE LIBYA AS A BRAND HAS BEEN TARN EARNED BY THE CRAZY THINGS  THAT YOU'VE DONE.
THAT'S TRUE.
BEAR WITH MOW. COPE AN OPEN MIND WITH THIS, AM WAS DOOR. HERE WE GO. LIBYA, THERE IT IS, THERE SHE IS.
OKAY W W I ARGUE THAT THIS NAME IS A LITTLE TARNISHED NOW. TRY THIS.
GET SOME POP, NO.
NORWAY.
I'VE GOT OTHERS. NOW I'M GLAD I BROUGHT THEM BUT THIS IS A PERSONAL FAVORITE OF MINE. OILFRICA.
OIL AFRICAN.
NO, OILFRICA.
OIL AFRICA, IT ROLLS EASIER OFF THE TONGUE THAN YOU ARE MAKING IT.
OIL AFRICA.
I CANNOT PRONOUNCE T HOW CAN YOU MAKE ME TO LIKE WITH.
OILFRICA.
IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS YOU WILL HATE THIS.
OILGAM G SM.
THE ONLY NAME I WILL I DO FOR IS LIBYA, NO OTHER NAME.
THOUGH HIS COUNTRY WAS MOVING FORWARD, THE AMBASSADOR WAS SADLY STUCK IN THE PAST.
WHAT ABOUT THE FLAG.
THAT'S MY FLAG. THAT'S THE INDEPENDENT FLAG. THERE IS THAT FLAG, IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. AND MAKE A LOT OF HOPE FOR THE LIBYAN PEOPLE.
SO YOU LIKE THE FLAG.
OF COURSE, OF COURSE, WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND THIS BEAUTIFUL STAR.
ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS THIS CRESCENT, THAT CAN COME ACROSS AS A LITTLE BIT  THREATENING TO AMERICANS. SO WHAT I AM SAYING ROTATE THAT 90 de GROHS, THROW AN EXTRA STAR ON THERE, TURN  THE COLORS A MORE FRIENDLY PASTEL, BOOM.
WHAT, YOU ARE OFFERING ME THIS FLAG.
YEAH.
I'M SORRY.
THOUGH WE MAY DISAGREE ON THE DETAIL WES BOTH WESTERN THE BEST FOR AMERICA'S OLD  FRIEND WHO BECAME AN ENEMY, WHO BECAME A FRIEND AGAIN FOR A WHILE, ONLY TO BECOME AN ENMOW ONCE MORE.
