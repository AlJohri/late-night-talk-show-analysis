FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST LEGENDARY BRAZILLAN FOOTBALLER PELE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'LL ASK HIM HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ACHIEVING HIS LIFE'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAALS! [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST BIG CAMPAIGN FINANCE DECISION OUT OF THE NATION'S HIGHEST COURT.
BREAKING NEWS FROM THE SUPREME COURT. MAJOR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION CASE.
THE CASE WAS BROUGHT BY ALABAMA BUSINESSMAN SHAUN MCCUTCHEON WHO ARGUES HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AS MANY CANDIDATES AS HE WANTS IN AN ELECTION CYCLE.
Jon: WHO IS STOPPING YOU? I MEAN IT'S YOUR LAWN, RIGHT? I MEAN -- [LAUGHTER] WAIT A MINUTE, YOU DON'T MEAN SUPPORT LIKE SUPPORT, YOU MEAN SUPPORT LIKE SUPPORT.
I THINK THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL FREE SPEECH ISSUE ABOUT YOUR RIGHT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON AS MANY CANDIDATES AS YOU CHOOSE.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. I'M SORRY IT'S THE WHOLE MONEY EQUALS SPEECH AS A WAY TO FURTHER AMPLIFY BIG DONOR'S INFLUENCE ON POLITICS. YOU KNOW, BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON MONEY EQUALING MONEY WASN'T GETTING IT DONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE COURT LEFT IN TACT HOW MUCH ANY PERSON CAN GIVE TO A SINGLE FEDERAL CANDIDATE BUT IT DID AWAY WITH A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH ANYBODY CAN GIVE TO ALL CANDIDATES PUT TOGETHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: VICTORY. FINALLY WE'RE RID OF THE COROSIVE INFLUENCE OF NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN POLITICS.
BASICALLY IT GIVES PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY AT THEIR DISPOSAL THE CHANCE TO SPREAD THEIR INFLUENCE EVEN MORE WIDELY. IF YOU HAVE $1 MILLION THINK OF HOW MANY CHUNKS OF $5200 THAT MAKES.
YOU CAN WRITE A LOT OF CHECKS.
Jon: YEP. LOTS AND LOTS OF $5200 CHECKS. THE LAST GREAT HOPE OF PRESERVING OUR DEMOCRACY FROM THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF MONEY IS CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT, WHAT RATIONALE -- [  APPLAUSE  ] -- WHAT RATIONALE DID THE COURT USE TO JUSTIFY THIS 5 TO 4 SPLIT DECISION. LET'S HEAR SOME DISSENT FROM LIBERAL JUSTICE KAGAN.
IF YOU TAKE OFF THE AGGREGATE LIMITS PEOPLE WILL BE ALLOWED, YOU PUT TOGETHER THE NATIONAL COMMITTEES AND STATE COMMITTEES AND ALL THE CANDIDATES IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE IT COMES TO OVER $3.5 MILLION.
Jon: I AM SORRY. THE VISUAL -- THE SUPREME COURT DOESN'T ALLOW CAMERAS INTO THE SUPREME COURT. I ASSUME TO PROTECT THE JUDGE'S PRIVACY FROM THOSE REVENGE UP-ROBE PORN SITES. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHAT YOU SAW THERE WE HAD OUR DAILY SHOW COURT SKETCH ARTIST AT THE COURT TO CAPTURE THE ARGUMENTS. THAT'S WHERE THOSE DRAWINGS COME FROM. HERE IS THE CONSERVATIVE REBUTTAL. FIRST SCALIA SPEAKS FROM THE BENCH IN HIS HOT TUB FULL OF MONEY. GO.
JUST TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, HOW MUCH MONEY IS SPENT BY POLITICAL PARTIES AND PACS IN ALL ELECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY? WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT UP I DON'T THINK $3.5 MILLION IS A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY.
Jon: ANTONIN SCALIA'S ARGUMENT THE STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST JUSTICE, HIS ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE SURE $3.5 MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A DONOR IS MAKING IT RAIN UNTIL YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE MONSOON SEASON OF MONEY THAT WE UNLEASHED IN OUR PREVIOUS CITIZENS UNITED DECISION ALLOWING CORPORATIONS AND UNIONS TO DONATE TO SUPER PACS. I BELIEVE THE FIGURE THERE THE LIMIT WAS WHATEVER THE (bleep) YOU WANT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MAY THINK EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN POLITICS, SURELY MILLIONS CAN STILL HAVE SOME CORRUPTING EFFECT, NO? AND AREN'T WE, BY ATTEMPTING TO LIMIT CONTRIBUTIONS, JUST TRYING TO LIMIT THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF MONEY OR AT LEAST THE APPEARANCE OF THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF MONEY. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT YOU ARE (bleep) WRONG.  [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THIS SUPREME COURT, THE ONLY KIND OF CORRUPTION THAT MATTERS IS THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE THOMAS NAST-LIKE MONOCLE TOP HATTED MAN HANDS A BAG OF MONEY LABELED MONEY FOR BRIBE TO A LITERAL FAT CAT WHILE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC STANDS BEHIND THEM WEARING A BARREL KNOWN AS QUID PRO QUO CORRUPTION.
UNLESS THE MONEY IS TRANSFERRED. YOU HAVE TO GET IT FROM THE PERSON WHO WANTS TO CORRUPT TO THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE CORRUPTED. UNLESS THE MONEY CAN MAKE IT FROM A TO B I DON'T SEE WHERE THE QUID PRO QUO ARGUMENT IS.
Jon: IS HE (bleep) THAT BAG? NO WONDER THEY DON'T WANT CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM. SO LET ME GET THAT STRAIGHT. JUSTICE ALITO DOESN'T SEE HOW MONEY CORRUPTS POLITICS UNLESS YOU CAN DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE FROM I AM GIVING YOU THIS MONEY TO DO THIS THING FOR ME. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND JUSTICE ALITO A BROADER NONLITERAL QUID QUO PRO LIKE AN HISTORICAL EXAMPLE OF THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS. WHAT IF WE REACHED BACK IN HISTORY TO LIKE THIS WEEKEND.
THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS ARE HEADING WEST TO LAS VEGAS. THEY ARE SPEAKING AT THE SPRING MEETING OF REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION BUT MORE IMPORTANT THEIR PRIVATE TALKS WITH ONE MAN, REPUBLICAN SUPER DONOR SHELDON ADELSON.
Jon: I WOULD RESPECTFULLY LIKE TO APPROACH THE BENCH AND REMIND THE COURT THAT WHEN THE MEDIA REFERS TO SHELDON ADELSON AS A SUPER DONOR THEY ARE NOT TALKING SPERM. I HOPE. A PACK OF REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS JUST FLEW ALL THE WAY TO LAS VEGAS JUST TO KISS THE SCOOTER RIDING ASS OF ONE 80-YEAR-OLD BILLIONAIRE. DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING THOUGH RIGHT. I MEAN PEOPLE ON FEAR FACTOR SPEED EAT A PLATE OF BULL TESTICLES FOR $50,000. IT DOESN'T MEAN THE TWO ARE CONNECTED. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MONEY CHANGES THEIR BEHAVIOR.
LATER ACCORDING TO NBC NEWS CHRISTIE DID APOLOGIZE TO ADELSON.
HE ENDED UP HAVING TO APOLOGIZE FOR REFERRING THE WEST BANK AS QUOTE OCCUPIED TERRITORY.
Jon: STILL DON'T THINK MONEY HAS A MORE GENERL CORRUPTING INFLUENCE ON POLITICS? CAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THIS MY FAMILY IS FULL OF 80-YEAR-OLD JEWS WHO WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO TELL POLITICIANS WHAT WORDS THEY CAN AND CANNOT USE TO DESCRIBE ISRAEL BUT AS OF THIS TAPING NO PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS HAVE FLOWN TO THEIR HOUSE TO SOLICIT THAT OPINION. OBVIOUSLY WE TAPE AT 6:00, THE SHOW IS ON AT 11:00, THINGS COULD CHANGE BETWEEN THAT TIME. THERE MAY BE A PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS CONFERENCE AT MY AUNT DORIS'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW. IF SO OBVIOUSLY MONDAY'S SHOW WILL BE A FULL APOLOGY. IN WHO'S DELUSIONAL MIND IS DEMOCRACY MADE BETTER BY LETTING WEALTHIER PEOPLE CONTROL MORE OF IT?
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLITICAL LEFT DOESN'T LIKE DECISIONS LIKE CITIZENS UNITED AND McCUTCHEON BECAUSE THEY EXPAND THE PLAYING FIELD. THEY ENABLE MORE CITIZENS TO BE INVOLVED, MORE CITIZENS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CANDIDATES AND CAUSES THEY BELIEVE IN. THAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA.
Jon: (bleep). [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I CAN'T EVEN DO THE TURTLE VOICE. I WON'T EVEN -- HOW THE (bleep) DOES THIS DECISION ENABLE MORE CITIZENS TO CONTRIBUTE? ACCORDING TO THE AP IN 2012, 646 INDIVIDUALS BUMPED UP AGAINST THE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMIT THAT THIS CASE STRUCK DOWN. MCCUTCHEON DOESN'T GET MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED. IT LETS THOSE 646 INDIVIDUALS GET THEMSELVES MORE INVOLVED. HOW DID THE SUPREME COURT HANDLE VOTER I.D. LAWS?
THEY SAID STATES CAN REQUIRE A VOTER I.D. AT THE POLLS TO PREVENT VOTER FRAUD.
Jon: THE COURT CONVENIENTLY IGNORES THE REAL EFFECTS OF DONOR LOBBYIST INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX UNDER THE GUISE OF MAKING OUR DEMOCRACY MORE INCLUSIVE YET THEY ARE PERFECTLY OKAY WITH VOTER I.D. LAWS UNDER THE GUISE OF PROTECTING US MOSTLY NONEXISTENT VOTER IN PERSON VOTER FRAUD. ACTUALLY MAKES OUR DEMOCRACY LESS INCLUSIVE. CORRUPTION THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS, I DON'T SEE IT. VOTER FRAUD THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN? HM? [LAUGHTER] JUSTICE IS BLIND BUT IN ONLY ONE EYE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO MONEY DOESN'T CORRUPT OUR SYSTEM. LAST YEAR THEY STRUCK DOWN PARTS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. RACISM DOESN'T APPARENTLY CORRUPT OUR SYSTEM ANYMORE BECAUSE THESE JUSTICES STRUCK DOWN SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. SO WHAT IF THE VIEW OF THESE JUSTICES HAS A CORRUPTING INFLUENCE ON OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS?
DO YOU THINK THAT THE RULES WILL CHANGE IN ALLOWING TELEVISION CAMERAS IN THE COURT?
NOT A CHANCE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BECOME ENTERTAINMENT.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING SICK ABOUT MAKING ENTERTAINMENT OUT OF REAL PEOPLE'S LEGAL PROBLEMS.
THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON TELEVISION ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE INSTITUTION, BOTH THE CIVIL TRIAL AND THE SUPREME COURT ARGUMENT. ALL OF THE JUSTICES VIEW THEMSELVES AS TRUSTEES OF THE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INSTITUTION.
Jon: TELEVISED SUPREME COURT HEARINGS, APPARENTLY THE ONE THING SO CORROSIVE TO THE PROCESS THAT IT CAN NEVER BE ALLOWED TO EXERT ITS UNHOLY INFLUENCE UPON OUR SACRED DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION IS TRANSPARENCY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
