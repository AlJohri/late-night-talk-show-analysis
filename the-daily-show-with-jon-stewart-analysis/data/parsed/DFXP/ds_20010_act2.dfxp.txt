[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THE BIG STORY THIS MIDTERM ELECTION SEEMS TO BE REPUBLICANS WINNING SEATS CURRENTLY HELD BY DEMOCRATS. BUT THERE ARE A FEW REPUBLICAN AREAS WHERE DEMOCRATS' CHANCES LOOK GOOD. FOR INSTANCE, NEW YORK'S 11th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OR STATEN ISLAND IF YOU'RE NASTY. WHY IS IT UP FOR GRABS? DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE DOMENIC RECCHIA'S CAMPAIGN AD SUMS IT UP PRETTY WELL.
COUNT ONE, LYING UNDER OATH.
COUNT TWO, FAILING TO REPORT OVER $1 MILLION IN INCOME.
COUNT FOUR.
COUNT FIVE.
COUNT 20. Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THE REASON DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE THERE IS THE 20 FEDERAL CRIMES THAT REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMMM IS CHARGED WITH. IT'S A BIT OF A HANDICAP FOR HIM. AS IS THIS LITTLE INCIDENT FROM JANUARY WHEN A NEW YORK 1 REPORTER HAD THE NERVE TO ASK GRIMM ABOUT THOSE ALLEGATIONS.
LET ME BE CLEAR TO YOU. YOU EVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN,  I'LL THROW YOU OFF THIS [BLEEP] BALCONY. I'LL BREAK YOU IN HALF -- LIKE A BOY. [BEEP]
Jon: TO BE CLEAR THAT'S HOW HE BEHAVES WHEN HE KNOWS THERE IS A CAMERA ROLLING. AS IF THE SEAT WASN'T ALREADY RECCHIA'S FOR THE ASKING HE ALSO MASSIVELY OUT FUNDRAISED GRIMM OVER THE SUMMER. SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT IN THE MOST RECENT POLLING RECCHIA WAS LOSING TO THE 20 COUNT INDICTMENT BOY-BREAKING GRIMM BY FOUR POINTS. WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT -- WAIT? HOW THE [BLEEP] DOES THAT HAPPEN? ONE CLUE CAME WHEN RECCHIA WAS OUT GETTING THE SCHUMER ENDORSEMENT AND WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS FOREIGN POLICY CREDENTIALS. KEEP YOUR EYE ON OL' CHUCK SCHUMER AND WATCH FOR THE MOMENT WHEN SCHUMER STARTS TO ENDORSE THE TOPS OF HIS SHOES.
WHEN I WAS ON THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD I RAN A STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAM WITH JAPAN FOR STUDENTS OF HIS DISTRICT THAT HE REPRESENTS. ALRIGHT WITH JAPAN. I HAVE BEEN TO ISRAEL, I'VE BEEN TO ITALY. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY, MANY COUNTRIES ACROSS THIS WORLD.
Jon: FOREIGN POLICY. WHAT? I MET A JAPANESE EXCHANGE STUDENT. IT'S ALL GOOD. YOU SEE SCHUMER DO THIS -- OH BOY. IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN WHEN EVEN CHUCK SCHUMER DOES NOT WANT TO BE ON CAMERA WITH YOU. CHUCK SCHUMER. THAT'S A MAN WHO SEEKS OUT LITTLE RED RECORDING LIGHTS LIKE A SUN FLOWER GROWING TOWARDS THE SUN. [LAUGHING] AM I ON TELEVISION? BUT THIS IS A HIGH PROFILE RACE. SURELY THE PARTY HAS BRIEFED RECCHIA ON THE ISSUES?
THE DEMOCRAT DEFINED HIS POSITION ON A MASSIVE TRADE AGREEMENT PROPOSAL KNOWN AS TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP OR TPP. BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGREEMENT SEEMED A BIT UNCLEAR.
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TPP.
SORRY, WE'RE GOING TO HEAD BACK INSIDE.
OKAY.
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TPP? [LAUGHING]
Jon: TO HIS CREDIT AT NO POINT DID RECCHIA THREATEN TO THROW THAT NEW YORK 1 REPORTER OFF A BALCONY. HE DID WHAT ANY GENTLEMAN DOES WHEN FACED WITH A GOTCHA QUESTION LIKE, "DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?" HE SNUCK OFF TO GOOGLE IT.
A HALF HOUR LATER WE GAVE THE CANDIDATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER OUR QUESTION.
THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP IS MANUFACTURING -- MANUFACTURE MORE HERE IN AMERICA, KEEP THE JOBS IN AMERICA. MADE IN AMERICA IS BETTER FOR THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: HERE IS HOW BAD THAT ANSWER WAS. THE RESTAURANT RATING IN THE WINDOW BEHIND HIM ACTUALLY CHANGED GRADES. F PLUS. THAT'S WORSE THAN AN F. IT MEANS THEY FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. WELL IT'S TOO BAD A CERTAIN NEW YORK 1 REPORTER KEEPS SABOTAGING THIS CAMPAIGN.
WHEN WE ASKED RECCHIA TO COMMENT ON GRIMM'S RECORD ON TRADE, HE OFFERED THIS.
HE HAS NOT DONE A LOT FOR LABOR. HE HAS A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD ON LABOR. OKAY? HE HAS A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD ON LABOR. MY RECORD IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.
A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD FROM WHERE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHEN YOU RATE IN LABOR HE HAS A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD ON LABOR.
Jon: WHAT, NO? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? LABOR, THE LABOR PLACE WITH THE PERCENTS THAT THEY RATE YOU. [LAUGHING] NOW, NOW,  IF YOU DON'T MIND I HAVE TO GO BACK INSIDE THE BRICK THINGY WITH THE ROOF. [LAUGHING] SO THE DEMOCRATS ARE BLOWING THIS. BUT THERE IS STILL THE LITTLE MATTER OF GRIMM'S FEDERAL CRIMINAL CHARGES. AND THAT CAME UP AT THEIR DEBATE. AND I BET GRIMM'S NOT GOING TO HAVE A VERY GOOD ANSWER FOR IT.
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR DAY IN COURT. AND AS A UNITED STATES MARINE, [ APPLAUSE ] I FOUGHT FOR THT CONSITUTIONAL RIGHT. SO I'LL HAVE MY DAY IN COURT.
Jon: THEY [BEEP] APPLAUD, THE GUY IS UP ON 20 CHARGES. WHERE ARE THEY HOLDING THIS DEBATE THE HOME FOR RETIRED WASTE MANAGEMENT SUPERVISORS AND LEGITIMATE BUSINESSMEN. YA, YA, YOU GET YOUR DAY IN COURT. YOU SHOW THESE [BLEEP], MIKEY. MAYBE THE PROSECUTOR WON'T SHOW UP, HE'S SUCH A GABA GOO -- [LAUGHING] EITHER WAY I THINK WE CAN AGREE THE REAL WINNER HERE IS NEW YORK'S 11th BECAUSE WHATEVER HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER ONE OF THESE TWO GENTLEMEN IS GOING TO BE REPRESENTING YOU IN CONGRESS. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
