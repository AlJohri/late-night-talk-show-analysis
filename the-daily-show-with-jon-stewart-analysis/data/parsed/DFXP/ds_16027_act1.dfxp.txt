FEBRUARY 23, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN DO WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT! I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW. OUR GUEST TONIGHT JERRY SEINFELD IS GOING TO --  [LAUGHTER] SORRY THAT IS DONALD RUMSFELD. [LAUGHTER] NOW ALL MY QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THE CONTEST. I DON'T THINK THEY HAD ONE OF THOSE. [LAUGHTER] OR DID THEY? [LAUGHTER] TO HE WILL BE ON LATER IN THE PROGRAM. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT THE UNREST IN THE MIDWEST OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF -- ♪ ♪  AFTER EIGHT DAYS OF PROTESTS OVER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER'S PROPOSAL TO STRIP STATE  EMPLOYEE UNIONS OF MUCH OF THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS WALKER HAS OFFERED, FINALLY, A  COUNTER PROPOSAL.
SCOTT WALKER WARNED HE WOULD LAYOFF 1500 PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IF HIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT PASS BY FRIDAY.
Jon: OKAY. [LAUGHTER] BY SATURDAY,,000 EMPLOYEE -- 5,000 EMPLOYEES. BY SUNDAY HE DECLARES THE RIGHT OF GOVERNOR TO HAVE SEX WITH ANY UNION WIFE ON THEIR WEDDING DAY  SAYS -- QUOTE -- "ELECTIONSELECTIONS HAV CONSEQUENCES." WHO IS THIS GUY WALKER. KIND OF FAT CAT BUSTING ATILA THE HUN -- THAT MAN LOOKS NICE. THAT CY SIMMS ADVERTISEMENTS OR WHOEVER GENTILES BUY SUITS, THE SAME GOVERNOR WHO THREATENS THAT  IF HE DOESN'T GET WHAT HE WANTS BY FRIDAY, THE STREETS OF MADISON WILL RUN PINK WITH SLIPS. HE ADDRESSED WISCONSIN WITH I'M SURE THE KIND OF HARD LINE RHETORIC THAT WILL BELIE HIS  MILD LET'S SAY CHEDDAR LIKE APPEARANCE.
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE CHOSEN A CAREER IN GOVERNMENT. I AISLE DO.
Jon: I AM GOING TO MAKE A POINT, I REALLY DO IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY YOU REALLY DON'T. THAT IS WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE BUSINESS AS THE CONVINCING CLAUSE. I LOVE YOU, I REALLY DO. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY BREAKING UP WITH YOU RIGHT NOW IS SO DIFFICULT. [LAUGHTER] BUT GO ON.
IN 1985 WHEN I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR IN THE SMALL TOWN OF DELLVIN I WAS INSPIRED TO  PURSUE PUBLIC SERVICE AFTER I ATTENDED THE AMERICAN LEGION'S BADGER BOY STATE PROGRAM.
Jon: YOU WERE A BADGER BOY? I WAS A BADGER BOY. HE WAS A BADGER BOY. ♪ DIG YOU BADGERS TOWARDS THE LIGHT ♪  [LAUGHTER] ♪ ALWAYS DOING WHAT IS RIGHT ♪
SOME QUESTION WHY WE HAVE TO REFORM COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BARGAINING  BALANCE THE BUDGET.
Jon: THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO REFORM COLLECTIVE BARGAINING  BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE UNIONS HAVE MADE THE FINANCIAL CONSESSIONS YOU ASKED OF THEM SO  LONG AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REMAINS IN TACT.
I TRIED TO USE MODEST CHANGES IN PENSION AND HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS AS A WAY OF  BALANCING THE BUDGET. ON NEARLY EVERY OCCASION THE LOCAL UNION EMPOWERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAIN AGREEMENTS  TOLD ME TO GO AHEAD AND LAY OFF WORKERS. THAT IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.
Jon: BUT NOW THEY ARE SAYING THEY'LL MAKE CHANGES TO PENSION AND HEALTH INSURANCE AND  YOU ARE THREATENING TO LAY PEOPLE OFF. AND NOW THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THEM. THIS IS FREAKING ME OUT! [LAUGHTER] BE BESIDES, UNIONS, EVEN IF YOU ARE STREUPTD OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS YOU ARE STILL  WEARING PAPBLTS.
IT'S IMPORTANT TOLL -- WEARING PANTS.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER MOST OF THE RIGHTS WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT DO NOT COME FROM COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, IT COMES FROM THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM IN WISCONSIN. THAT LAW WAS PASSED LONG BEFORE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND IT WILL CONTINUE AFTER THE PLAN IS APPROVED.
Jon: TO CHANGE THE LAW YOU WOULD NEED A STATE LAW WILLING TO GO ALONG WITH IT AND AN  ANTIUNION GOVERNOR. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND DOCTOR OOOH. -- WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO FIND -- OH. [LAUGHTER] WALKER SEEMED STRAIGHTFORWARD, DIRECT AND GENUINE IN HIS ADDRESS ON TELEVISION LAST NIGHT. LESS SO WHEN EXPLAINING HIS PLANS TO A REPORTER FROM A BUFFALO BEAST WHO CALLED THEM UP  PRETENDING TO BE ONE OF COKE BROTHERS, THE BILLIONAIRE DUO WHO FINANCIALLY PW-BGD MANY  REPUBLICAN CAUSES AND CANDIDATES INCLUDING WALKER, NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WIT.
AN INTERESTING IDEA BROUGHT UP BY MY CHIEF OF STAFF, WE  DON'T DO IT UNTIL TOMORROW, IS PUTTING OUT AN APPEAL TO THE DEMOCRAT LEADER THAT I WOULD BE  WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK TO HIM BUT I'LL ONLY DO IT IF ALL 14 OF THEM COME BACK AND SIT  DOWN IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS PRETTY REASONABLE. EVEN WHEN HE THINKS NO ONE IS LISTENING HE IS TALKING COMPROMISE. I'M SURE THERE'S NO MORE TO THAT TAPE.
ONCE THEY'VE GONE INTO SESSION, THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY HAVE TO BE THERE. IF THEY ARE ACTUALLY IN SESSION FOR THAT DAY AND THEY TAKE A RECESS, THE 19 SENATE  REPUBLICANS COULD THEN GO INTO ACTION AND THEY WOULD HAVE A QUORUM BECAUSE THEY STARTED OUT  THAT THEY. IF THEY HEARD I WOULD TALK TO THEM THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY REASON WHY.
Jon: THE ONLY REASON YOU WOULD TALK TO THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTERPARTS IN THE STATE SENATE  IS TO TRICK THEM? IT'S SLEAZYIER BUT STILL IN THE REALM OF ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL STRATEGY.
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT THE CROWDS OF PLANTING SOME TROUBLE MAKERS.
WELL, THE ONLY PROBLEM D WE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT --  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: PLANT TROUBLE MAKERS? YOU WORE A BADGE -- WERE A BADGER BOY. WE HAVE SWORN TO DEFEND WISCONSIN FROM TROUBLE MAKERS AND ALL OF WISCONSIN'S ENEMIES. ♪ OH WISCONSIN NO TO COMMUNISTS, ISLAMISTS AND THE LACTOSE INTOLERANT ♪  [LAUGHTER] WELL, LOOK, I BET IF WE LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAYS TO THE FAKE DAVID COKE, NO, WE CAN'T BRING  IN TROUBLE MAKERS THAT WOULD BE WRONG MORALLY. IT'S A REP REPREHENSIBLE STRATEGY USED BY FRINGE ELEMENTS AND BE NEATH THE DIG KNIT OF THE  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF WISCONSIN GO BADGERS. LET'S LISTEN IN.
IF THERE WAS A RAUCOUS CAUSE THAT WOULD SCARE THE PUBLIC INTO  THINKING MAYBE THE GOVERNOR HAS TO SET TOLL AVOID ALL THE PROBLEMS.
Jon: I WANT THE PROTESTERS TO LOOK BAD BUT NOT SO BAD THAT  THEY BECOME A PROBLEM IN A NEEDS SOLVING. [LAUGHTER] FOR THOSES OF YOU WHO HAVE SEEN GLENN BECK'S TAKE ON HOW THE WISCONSIN PROTESTS PLAY INTO A  BIGGER ISLAMO-SOCIALIST CONSPIRACY BENT ON NOTHING LESS THAN A NEW WORLD ORDER, TAKE  COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT THERE'S A EQUALLY VAST AND PLAUSIBLE DESTINATION.
WHO IS MOVING THE CHESS PIECES IN WISCONSIN? WE KNOW THE AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY ORGANIZE ORGANIZATION BACKED BY THE COKE BROTHERS HAS  BEEN CLOSEST INVOLVED IN THE ANTIUNION PROTESTS AFTER SPENDING $5 MILLION ALMOST WHAT  I MAKE IN AN HOUR TO GET SCOTT WALKER ELECTED. THE COKE BROTHER BACKED RGA IS WARNING HIM UNLESS UNIONS GET BUSTED THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE AS  MUCH MONEY TO SEND HIS WAY IN 2014.
Jon: BECK IS NOT WRONG. AND IF HE WAS YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
