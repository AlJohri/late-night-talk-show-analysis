( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, BESTSELLING AUTHOR, THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE BULLY PULPIT." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LOVELY TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS A LOT. BUSY ALL DAY, DOING ALL KIND OF WORK I HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THIS-- TWO AND A HALF MILLION PAGES.
IT'S THINNER THAN "LINCOLN."
IT IS THINNER THAN "LINCOLN." BUT THAT HAD A TEAM OF RIVALS.
THIS HAS A CAST OF CHARACTERS.
IT HAS A CAST OF CHARACTERS BUT IT'S TAFT, TEDDY ROOSEVELT AND THE JOURNALISTS. THE BOOK IS "THE BULLY PULPIT." TWO GUYS WEARING MUSTACHES WHEN THEY WERE AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF EXPRESSION. TAFT AND ROOSEVELT WERE THICK AS THIEVES, AND THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP FALLS APART WHEN THEY FIGHT EACH OTHER FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I MEAN, I DIDN'T-- ALL I KNEW WAS THAT TEDDY WAS THE ONE I WANTED TO STUDY BECAUSE HE WAS IN A TIME WHEN POLITICAL LEADERS FOUGHT FOR THINGS, WHEN THE JOURNALISTS HAD A MISSION AND A CALL, WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS RIGHTING ANCIENT WRONGS. THAT'S THE KIND OF ERA I WANT TO LIVE IN. I HAVE TO LIVE WITH THESE GUYS FOR SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE IT TAKES ME SO LONG AND I NEEDED AN ANGLE OTHER THAN TEDDY AND IT TURNS OUT TAFT HAD A REALLY DEEP FRIENDSHIP. TEDDY SAID, "MY BELOVED TAFT." THERE'S A LOT GOING ON BETWEEN THESE TWO. THE FAMILIES LIVED NEXT TO EACH OTHER. TEDDY HAND PICKED HIM TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR IN 1908, RAN HIS CAMPAIGN, TOLD HIM, "DON'T PLAY GOLF. IT'S A WORKING MAN'S GAME." TAFT HAD A SONG  ♪ GET ON A RAFT WITH TAFT." TAFT WEIGHED 350 POUNDS. IT WOULD BE A DUBIOUS PROPOSITION.
Jon:  EVEN IF TAFT WAS NOT HEAVY, I FEEL LIKE "GET ON A RAFT WITH TAFT."
IT RHYMES, RIGHT?
Jon:  IT DOES RHYME.
IT DOES RHYME. ANYWAY, HE RUNS HIS CAMPAIGN. HE'S SO HAPPY WHEN HE WINS, THINKS HE'LL CARRY OUT MY LEGACY, AND THEN HE GOES TO AFRICA COMES BACK, AND FEELS TAFT IS NOT AS PROGRESSIVE AS HE WANTED AND HE ALSO WANTED TO GET BACK IN THE GAME. HE LOVED POLITICS AND RUNS AGAINST HIM IN 1912 AND IT GETS REALLY UGLY. IT MAKES ME SAD. HE CALLS TAFT A FAT HEAD AND SAYS HE HAS THE BRAIN OF A GUINEA PIG AND TAFT SAID HE'S A DICTATOR AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP, NEEDLESS TO SAY, BREAKS APART.
Jon:  AND THEY CHANGED IT TO  ♪ DON'T RUN FOR TAFT HE'LL GIVE YOU THE SHAFT." TEDDY ROOSEVELT REALLY WENT AFTER HIM.
Jon:  WHAT I FOUND SO FASCINATING IN OUR CURRENT VERNACULAR OF REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND THINGS LIKE THIS, AND THE HOPE AND INSPIRATION OF WHAT FREE PEOPLE CAN DO WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER AND FORM GOVERNMENTS, AND FORM-- IS THAT THEY-- TEDDY ROOSEVELT, ESPECIALLY HAD THIS VISION OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT IS TODAY, I THINK, WOULD BE CONSIDERED COMMUNIST.
RIGHT. AND HERE HE IS A REPUBLICAN. HE'S DRAGGING A RELUCTANT REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO HELP WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION, GET CHILDREN OUT OF FACTORIES, BREAK UP THE BIG TRUSTS. THE WAY HE DID IT WAS HE HAD A REMARKABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESS. HE LET THEM IN WHEN HE WAS SHAVING, HE HAD THE BARBER'S HOUR --
THAT WAS WEIRD.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE WOULD TAKE WALKS WITH JOURNALISTS AND AMBASSADORS AND HE WOULD TALK THE WHOLE TIME AND HE WENT THROUGH THE PARK, AND IF-- YOU COULDN'T GO OVER AN OBSTACLE. IF YOU HAD A ROCK, YOU HAD TO GO OVER IT. IF IT WAS A PRECIPICE, YOU HAD TO GO DOWN IT. THERE'S ONE AMBASSADOR WHO THINKS-- HE'S DYING IN THE PARK. THEY FINALLY GET TO A STREAM AND HE THINKS THANK GOD IT'S OVER. AND TED SAID, WE BETTER UNDRESS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CROSS THE STREAM. HE SAID FOR THE HONOR OF FRANCE I TOOK OFF MY CLOTHES AND GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE. AND TED SAID WHY DO YOU HAVE ON THESE LAVENDER GLOVES. AND HE SAID YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU MIGHT MEET LADIES ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO THAT'S MY GUY. HE'S GREAT. AND HE'S ABLE TO APOLOGIZE WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG. HE'S ABLE TO NOT GET MADE WHEN THE PRESS GETS MAD AT HIM. SOMEBODY WROTE A BAD REVIEW OF HIS "ROUGH RIDERS" BOOK AND SAID IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN CUBA AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED "ALONE IN CUBA" HE WROTE THE GUY BACK AND SAID, "I REGRET TO TELL YOU, MY WIFE AND FAMILY LOVED YOUR REVIEW OF MY BOOK." HE SAID NOW YOU OWE ME ONE. YOU NEED TO MEET ME BECAUSE I RESPECT THE PRESS.
Jon:  AND NOT A THIN-SKINNED MAN. HE HAD HIDE ON HIM.
HE BUILT HIS OWN HIDE. HE HAD ASTHMA AND WAS TOLD YOU HAD TO MAKE YOUR BODY AND BECAME AN EXERCISE MANIC.
Jon:  THIS IDEA OF LONG-FORM ACTIVIST MUCKRAKING, WHEN YOU READ IT, IT BRINGS A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. IT MAKES YOU DESPAIR WHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR CURRENT-- THIS IS MAYBE EVEN BEFORE UPTON SINCLAIR.
THEY'RE ALL FLOATING AROUND AT THE SAME TIME. THEY'RE ALL AT ONE MAGAZINE CALLED MCLURE'S AND THEY'RE THE LEGENDS OF JOURNALISM, THEY ARE GIVEN TWO YEARS TO DO THEIR RESEARCH, SO THAT THEY CAN COME OUT WITH STORIES THAT ARE FACTUALLY BASED, THAT ARE LIKE MINI HISTORIES. SO IDA TARBELL WROTE SOMETHING ON STANDARD OIL, AND IT LEADS TO THE DISINTEGRATION OF STANDARD OIL.
Jon:  THEY BREAK UP THE MONOPOLY. THEY BREAK UP THE MEAT BUSINESS.
ISN'T THAT GREAT? WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO LIVE IN THAT TIME?
Jon:  AND THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY ARE FOLLOWING THESE STORIES WITH GREAT INTEREST AND IT HAS A GREAT EFFICACY TO IT.
PEOPLE WOULD READ THESE AND PRESS THEIR CONGRESSMAN. THEY FELT IF YOU REGULATE THE ECONOMY THE ECONOMY WILL FALL APART AND THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF GOVERNMENT HAVING A REAL ROLE. IT JUST MAKES ME SAD TO SEE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. OUR ATTENTION SPAN IS LIMITED-- IS THAT YOUR ATTENTION SPAN? ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  I WAS JUST THINKING, OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE? LOVE? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE DEAD ON RIGHT. AND THE IDEA THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS HOW THESE INSTITUTIONS HOWEVER CORRUPT THEY'VE BECOME-- HAVE BECOME THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE MADE UP OF PEOPLE IS THE GREAT TRAGEDY OF THIS MORE MODERN ERA.
GUY McCLURE SAID IN THE END THERE'S NO ONE LEFT BUT ALL OF US, WHICH IS THE PEOPLE. AND RIGHT NOW WE THE PEOPLE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CRAZY AWFUL --
YOU NEED TO WRITE THAT ONE.
I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.
Jon:  SERIOUSLY.
IT'S A DEAL.
Jon:  I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT. OH, MAN! "THE BULLY PULPIT" IS ON THE SHELVES NOW. I AM TOTALLY GOING TO RUIN DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN'S NEXT BOOK! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
