(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS  THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC  MINORITY LEADER AND SERVED  CALIFORNIA'S 8th DISTRICT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM NANCY PELOSI! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE  WITH US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,  SO IN THE SENATE WHEN YOU  ARE-- YOU DON'T HAVE THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE,  EVERYTHING IS GEARED TOWARDS  YOU BEING ABLE TO STOP THE  OPPOSITE PARTY. DOES THE HOUSE HAVE ANY  MECHANISMS FOR THE MINORITY  PARTY TO SLOW DOWN  LEGISLATION OR NOT-- HOW HAS YOUR ROLE CHANGED FROM  HAVING THE MAJORITY TO NOT.
WELL, THE POWER OF THE  SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IS  AWESOME. IT IS VERY DIFFERENT-- .
Jon: LIKE THOR, WE SAY? WHEN YOU HOLD THE GAVEL,  THUNDER?
SOMETIMES MORE DAMAGE  THAN THAT UNDER THE  REPUBLICANS. BUT IT IS-- IT IS, IT'S A  DIFFERENT, IT'S JUST  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO  IS JUST WIN THE HOUSE FOR  THE DEMOCRATS SO THAT THE  PRESIDENT HAS A CONGRESS THAT WILL WORK WITH HIM.
Jon: SO THAT'S THE ONLY  THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS --
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH. WHAT I LIKE IS WHAT  PRESIDENT LINCOLN SAID, HE  SAID PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS  EVERYTHING. SO JUST TAKE IT TO THE  PUBLIC AND THAT IS WHAT  ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY ON THIS  BALLOT IT'S NOT JUST  DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICANS, JUST  NAMES ON THE BALLOT, IT'S  EVERYTHING ON THE BALLOT, HARD FOUGHT RIGHTS FOR WOMEN  ARE ON THE BALLOT, THE  MIDDLE CLASS IS ON THE  BALLOT, THE AMERICAN DREAM IS ON THE BALLOT, MEDICARE  IS ON THE BALLOT.
Jon: ARE YOU CONFIDENT  THAT THE DEMOCRATS-- YOU  KNOW, I FOLLOW THE POLLS,  NOTHING ELSE. (LAUGHTER)  I AM NOT AN ISSUES GUY. I LIKE NUMBERS. THEY SAY THAT THE SENATE  WILL BE VERY CLOSE IN TERMS  OF DEMOCRATIC CONTROL,  REPUBLICAN CONTROL BUT THAT THE HOUSE REALLY LOOKS  PRETTY CLEARLY GOING TO STAY  IN THE REPUBLICAN CONTROL.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE  ELECTIONS. IT ISN'T DETERMINED BY  PUNDITS T IS ERMBY THE  PEOPLE RZ.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING WE  SHOULD GO AHEAD WITH THE  ELECTION.
I THINK WE SHOULD.
Jon: KIND OF A BOLD  STANCE.
IT WILL BE VERY  INTERESTING. YOUR SEGMENT SHOWS YOU VERY  CLEARLY THE DIFFERENCES OF  OPINION IN OUR COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S  INTERESTING BECAUSE  ROMNEY-- GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAS  ENDORSED PERSONHOOD  AMENDMENT IN MISSISSIPPI.
Jon: I REMEMBER THAT.
AND EVEN THE PEOPLE OF  MISSISSIPPI REJECTED THAT  POSITION.
Jon: WELL, ROMNEY ALSO  REJECTED THAT POSITION AS  WELL.
WELL-- THE PRESIDENT  CALLS IT ROMNESIA. I HAVE MY OWN, WHAT I CALL  MITTOLOGY.
Jon: SLUNT ALL THAT BE MY  JOB, SHOULDN'T I BE ONE THE  ONE THINKING UP THESE VERY  CLEVER THINGS. BUT HOW ABOUT THAT, YOU GUYS  DO THAT-- LET ME JUST GO  RIGHT TO THE LAW. (LAUGHTER)  DOW CONSIDER-- I FIND THAT  IT SEEMS LIKE PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS NOT SEEMINGLY THE  HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE WAY THAT, LET'S SAY-- HE  IS BIG ON SEPARATION OF-- HE  HASSLE VATED THE LEGISLATIVE  POWER, TO SOME EXTENT.
WELL, IT IS A QUESTION OF  SHARED VALUES. WHAT IS IT WE ARE THERE TO  DO. IT'S TO THE ABOUT HAVING A  JOB, IT'S ABOUT DOING THE  JOB FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WHEN WE WERE THERE  AND HE WAS IN-- WHEN WE WERE  IN THE MAJORITY WITH THE  PRESIDENT, WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A GREAT DEAL FOR  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CAME IN  THEY SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT  NEVER, THIS DOES NEVER WORK  FOR YOU BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH YOU,  IT JUST WOULDN'T GOING TO  HAPPEN. SO CONTRARY WHEN WE WORKED  WITH PRESIDENT BUSH AS THE  MAJORITY DEMOCRAT SO THIS IS  SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
Jon: YOU THINK IT IS AN  UNUSUAL STRATEGY THAT THEY  HAVE-- .
AND BAD FOR THE COUNTRY. BUT THE FACT S AS I SAID,  ALL THOSE THINGS ARE ON THE  BALLOT. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT  ELECTION. WE CANNOT ACCEPT, AS I SAID,  WE CAN'T LISTEN TO SOMEBODY  SAYING YOU CAN'T WIN. WE DON'T AGONIZE OVER THAT. WE ORGANIZE TO GET EVERYBODY  TO VOTE SO THAT PRESIDENT  HAS A CLEAR MANDATE AND A  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THAT  THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE  ENOUGH TO IMPROVE THE  ACCOUNT ABILITY AND  EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT? IF YOU ARE'S GOING TO BE THE  PARTY THAT ADVOCATES FOR  STRONGER GOVERNMENT  INTERVENTION FOR TYPES OF ISSUES AND THINGS, YOU DON'T  HEAR AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT THAT,  EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNT ABILITY,  THE IDEA OF REDUNDANT PAPERWORK OR REDUNDANT  BUREAUS OR THAT TYPE OF  THING, LIKE JUST MORE  GOVERNANCE RATHER THAN ROLE.
DURING PRESIDENT  CLINTON'S TERM AS YOU KNOW,  YOU MAY RECALL, VICE  PRESIDENT GORE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE WE INVENT GOVERNMENT  INITIATIVE.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT NAME  AGAIN? I WAS MAKING A JOKE. (LAUGHTER)
OKAY. MAYBE I MISSED THAT.
Jon: NO, YOU GOT IT I  THINK YOU GOT IT.
BUT UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA,  EVERYTHING IS-- ALMOST  EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE  SUBJECTED TO SCRUTINY AND REVIEW HAS BEEN. AND THE STATISTICS WILL SHOW  THAT THERE WASN'T A GROWTH  OF REGULATION DURING  PRESIDENT OBAMA. THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION. BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE  ELECTION AND WHAT GOES  FORWARD.
Jon: FOR YOU IT IS MORE  PHILOSOPHICAL THIS TIME T  THIS IS A BIG PHILOSOPHICAL  ELECTION.
WHEN I SAY-- ALL OF OUR  NAMES ARE ON THE BALLOT BUT  THAT IS SO UNIMPORTANT, EVEN  DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN. WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE  SAVE MEDICARE, THE  REPUBLICANS WANT TO SEVER  THE MEDICARE GUARANTEE, END IT AS A GUARANTEE FOR  SENIORS. THAT TO ME IS THE MOST  IMPORTANT THING THAT IS ON  THE BALLOT WHEN YOU THINK OF  THE IMPACT IT HAS ON SENIORS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY  MISREPRESENT IT. THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, THEY  REVERSE IT THEY SAY WE TOOK  MONEY, SPENT ON OBAMA-- NOT  TRUE.
Jon: THEY SAY THEY ARE  SAVING IT BECAUSE IT IS  GOING BANKRUPT SO THEY ARE  GOING TO SAVE IT.
BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT  WE DID. WE TOOK THE MONEY TO SAVE  IT. THEY TOOK THE MONEY AND PUT  IT, GAVE TAX CUTS TO WEALTHY  PEOPLE. MILLIONAIRES OVER MEDICARE. THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT THE  ELECTION IS ABOUT. RESPECT FOR WOMEN OR NOT  THAT IS MORE MITTOLOGY.
Jon: IF THAT IS WHAT THE  ELECTION IS, THAT WOULD BE A  STARK CONTRAST.
AND THEN THE WHOLE IDEA.
Jon: I THINK THEY WOULD  PUSH BACK ON THE IDEA IS  ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY  RESPECT WOMEN BUT I  UNDERSTAND.
AND IT IS. AND WOMEN HAVE JUST ABOUT  THE MOST TO LOSE, WHETHER  YOU ARE A WOMAN OF CHILD  BEARING AGE OR A SENIOR WOMEN, IN MY CASE -- DID --.
Jon: NOT BEING EITHER ONE  I'M NOT QUALIFY TO ANSWER. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THAT'S GOOD YOU SAY  THAT BECAUSE MY REPUBLICAN  COLLEAGUES SAY THAT I THINK  I KNOW MORE ABOUT HAVING BABIES, HAVING FIVE CHILDREN  MYSELF. THEY SAY NANCY PELOSI THINKS  SHE KNOWS MORE ABOUT HAVING  BABIES THAN THE POPE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WOW. WELL, TO THAT END, I KNOW  MORE ABOUT SITTING IN MY  UNDERWEAR DRINKING BEER THAN  THE POPE. (LAUGHTER)
BUT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT,  AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.
Jon: I ABSOLUTELY DO. AND CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE  THAT AS WELL. GOOD LUCK TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  STOPPING BY. NANCY PELOSI, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
