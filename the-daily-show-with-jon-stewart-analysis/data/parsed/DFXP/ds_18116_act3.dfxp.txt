( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS EDITOR AT  LARGE FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE. HE'S ALSO THE HOST ON CNN,  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  FAREED ZAKARIA! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR BEING HERE. I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE OTHER  OPTIONS OPEN TO YOU AND OTHER  HOSTS, PERHAPS PREFERABLE HOSTS FOR YOU TO BE WITH, BUT I  APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.
YOU KNOW I STUDY  INTERNATIONAL POLITICAISE LOT. ARE YOU STAGING A BRILLIANT,  SLOW-MOTION COUP. HE'S OUT THERE FILMING IN SOME  MOROCCAN DESERT, AND MEANWHILE  YOU ARE SLOWING TAKING OVER THE EMPIRE SPHWHRAWN NO, NO, NO.
IT'S BREATHTAKING.
John: I SERVE AT THE  PLEASURE OF THE SUPREME LEADER. WHEN WE WERE PLANNING THE SHOW  FOR MONDAY, WE WERE THINKING  THIS WILL BE EASY, HUGE SUMMIT BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. THAT IS WHAT WE'LL DO THE SHOW  ABOUT. BOOM, THAT'S GONE WITH THE  N.S.A., AND YOU DON'T SEE THE  STORY ANYWHERE AND YET THAT WAS A PRETTY BIG DEAL, THE  CHINA-U.S. SUMMIT.
IN SOME SENSE IT'S THE  BIGGEST STORY-- WHEN HISTORIANS  LOOK BACK THEY'RE GOING TO ASK WAS THE UNITED STATES ABLE TO  LIVE PEACEFULLY WITH THE FASTEST  GROWING, MOST POWSM, NEW ENTRANT INTO THE WORLD, CHINA. IF YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY,  GERMANY'S RISE DIDN'T WORK OUT  SO WELL FOR EUROPE. TWO WORLD WARS. JAPAN'S RISE, A BUNCH OF  PROBLEMS THERE. HOW CHINA ARRIVES AND HOW THE  SUPER BOWLS ARE ABLE TO DEAL  WITH IT WILL IN SOME WAY BE THE STORY IN THE 21st CENTURY. WE BUILT A MORE COOPERATIVE  RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE NEW  LEADERSHIP GOT A CHANCE TO SIT  DOWN WITH THE AMERICAN  PRESIDENT. THEY TRIED TO DO IT DINLY. IT'S MOSTLY GOOD NEWS, WHICH IS  WHY YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT.
I GUESS THAT'S IT. BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE  FOCUSING ON BUILDING A  FUNCTIONING RELATIONSHIP. IF THAT INVOLVES MAKING THINGS  UNDER CASUAL, NOITIZE JUST-- I  BELIEVE THEY CHANGED THE FORMAT OF THE ACTUAL DISCUSSIONS THAT  WERE HAVING. IS THAT NOT TRUE?
RIGHT. SO NORMALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS TWO  HEADS OF STATE GET TOGETHER,  THEY EACH HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED TALKING POINT. HERE ARE THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING  THAT REALLY BUG ME. AND EACH SIDE RECITES THEM. THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE IS HERE ARE  THE PROBLEMS, I DON'T LIKE WHAT  YOU'RE DOING, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIX IT? THE OTHER SIDE GETS DEFENSIVE  AND THEY SCRAPPED ALL THAT AND  TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITY. WHAT CAN WE DO TO CREATE WIN-WIN  SCENARIO. THE CHILES BROUGHT OUT THIS  CHINESE LIQUOR, CALLED MOTAI.
John: THEY BROUGHT OUT  MOTAI'S.
IT'S REALLY REVOLTING CHINESE  LIQUOR IF YOU'VE EVER HAD IT.
John: THEY'RE ONE OF OUR  BIGGEST SPONSORS YOU CAN'T SAY  THAT.
ACTUALLY, WHAT I MEANT WAS  DELICIOUS. AND REVIVING. ONE OF THE GREAT SWITCHES IN  CHINA IS THEY HAVE BEEN MOVING  AWAY FROM THAT TO GOOD RED LINE. THEY CAN KEEP THE REST OF THE  TRADITIONAL CHINA. IF THEY KEEP THAT SWITCH I WILL  BE HAPPY.
Reporter: SOMETHING WAS  RELEASED WITH A 1942 SUMMIT  BETWEEN HUTCHIL AND STARLET, UNLESS THERE WAS THIS LATE NICE  DRINKING SESSION INTO 1:00 IN  THE MORNING. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH HAD AN  EXCLUSIVE AND THEY BOTH GOT  COMPLETELY DRUNK. AND BY THE END OF IT, THEY HAD  COME TO AN AGREEMENT.
John: THAT SEEMS LIKE A  GREAT WAY TO JUST BREAK THE ICE  EVERYWHERE. I LOVED-- THE IMAGE IN MY MIND  OF CHURCH, AND--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE'RE GOING TO GET THE NAUGHTIES, DEFINITELY. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO  SNORKELING TOGETHER. ( LAUGHTER ).
THE INNER HISTORY OF OUR  DIPLOMACY DOES INVOLVE A LOT OF  ALCOHOL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE  EQUIVALENT HERE.
John: I GUESS THE PROBLEM  IS IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP U.S. DIPLOMACY WITH THE MUSLIM WORLD. ( LAUGHTER )  YOU DON'T HAVE ALCOHOL  AVAILABLANS ICED BREAKER THERE.
YOU THINK IF WE WERE TO GET  TOGETHER WITH THE KING OF SAUDI  ARABIA AND SAID, "HOW ABOUT SOME CRISTAL."
EVERY TIME SOMEONE USED THE  WORD "OBSTRUCTION" YOU HAD TO  TAKE A WORD. HOW DID WE GET FROM THE CHINA  SUMMIT TO THIS?
John: I DON'T KNOW BUT I  HAVE TO SAY IT WAS A LOVELY  JIRN. THAT SHOWS WHAT A GREAT  CONSERVATIONALLIST ARE YOU.
AND WHAT'S REALLY IN THAT  MUG. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: I BLOODY LOVE YOU. CAN YOU STICK AROUND? THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.
I'D BE DELIGHTED. FAREED ZAKARIA, SUNDAYS ON CNN  AT 10 A.M. AND 1:00 P.M. FAREED ZAKARIA, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
