[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT COHOST OF MSNBC'S MORNING JOE HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE RIGHT PATH. AGAIN, WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JOE SCARBOROUGH, JOSEPH. NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SO LATE. I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
IT'S AWFUL.
Jon: IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.
IT'S HORRIBLE. TALKING ABOUT THE SHOW OR ME GETTING UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
Jon: THE SHOW IS LOVELY. I WATCH THE SHOW. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW.
IF YOU DID, WOULD YOU LOVE IT.
Jon: EISENHOWER AND REAGAN, IN MY BELIEF WOULD NOT WIN PRIMARIES IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ANYMORE, THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED COMMUNISTS ESPECIALLY EISENHOWER AFTER HIS MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX COMMENT WOULD BE DRUMMED OUT. TED CRUZ WOULD RUN A CRAZY, GENERAL EISENHOWER MADE OUT WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN. [ LAUGHTER ] THOSE GUYS WOULD -- THEY WOULD NEVER SURVIVE IN THIS CURRENT MANIFESTATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
I ACTUALLY THINK THEY WOULD IF THEY SPOKE OUT AGAINST THE MORE EXTREME ELEMENTS. DURING THE 2012 CAMPAIGN, I KEPT SAYING THERE WERE SO MANY SISTER SOLJA MOMENTS FOR MITT ROMNEY TO STAND UP AGAINST. TO STAND DOWN THE CRAZIES ON THE FAR RIGHT OR STAND DOWN THE CRAZIES IN THE CONSERVATIVE ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX AND HE NEVER DID IT. THE THING YOU FIND IN POLITICS IS IF YOU STAND UP TO THE MORE EXTREME ELEMENTS YOU ARE REWARDED NOT ONLY BY YOUR PEOPLE BUT THIS IS SHOCKING TO SOME PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW, INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS MAY EVEN VOTE FOR YOU. THAT USED TO BE A GOOD THING IKE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD THING. REAGAN THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. WE USED TO WIN 49 OUT OF 50 STATES.
Jon: BUT YOU USE USED TO NOT BE SO CRAZY.
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU CAN TALK THE STRATEGY. WHEN YOU SAY THEY SHOULD SPEAK OUT AGAINST THEM. THEY MADE THEM. THIS WAS NOT HAPPENSTANCE, THE RISE OF TEA PARTY AND ANGRY RIGHT. KARL ROVE THERE WAS THAT MEMO IN 2004, MATTHEW DOWD WROTE ABOUT IT. HE DESIGNED THIS TO APPEAL TO WHAT HE CALLED THE ANGER POINTS. HE DECIDED THAT THERE WERE NO MORE MODERATES LEFT. YOU CAN'T REALLY WIN ON THAT I'M GOING TO GET PEOPLE RILED UP. I'M GOING TO PLAY TO THEIR ANGER AND TO THEIR FEAR. FOX NEWS DID THE SAME THING. THEY MADE THESE PEOPLE.
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THOUGH. KARL ROVE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER SAY WE'RE GOING TO WIN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BY GOING TO THE HARD RIGHT.
Jon: NO, NIXON.
NIXON SAID YOU GO TO THE RIGHT IN THE PRIMARY AND IN THE GENERAL ELECTION GO TO THE CENTER.
Jon: THE SOUTHERN STRATEGY OF NIXON WAS TO TAKE THE DISAFFECTED OLD DEMOCRATIC VOTERS THAT WERE BIGOTED, THE OLD DIXIE-CRATS, PLAY ON THAT ANGER DIVIDE THEM AND GET THEM TO THE PO
NIXON GOT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS THAN ANY REPUBLICAN HAS GOTTEN IN YEARS. I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD PUT THE SOUTHERN STRATEGY ON NIXON. I DO SAY A STRONG LEADER THAT SPEAKS OUT AGAINST THE EXTREMES WHETHER IT'S BILL CLINTON OR WHETHER IT'S THE REPUBLICANS. WE CAN SAY CHRIS CHRISTIE IN NEW JERSEY FRANKLY DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT HIM ON BLOGS. OCCASIONALLY HE WILL YELL AT PEOPLE.
Jon: TEACHERS WHO COME UP TO HIM AND ASK QUESTIONS. HEY, MAN, HOW ABOUT THE TEACHERS UNION, GET OUT OF HER -- HERE YOU SON OF A BITCH -- THE BIGGER POINT IS IF YOU ARE A STRONG LEADER AND YOU CAN CALL OUT CRAZY YOU'LL GET REWARDED. NOT ONLY BY INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS BUT YOUR OWN PARTY. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN A LONG TIME. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, HE HAD THE CONFIDENCE AND THE POWER TO PULL IT OFF. RONALD REAGAN WAS A GUY.
Jon: IT WAS A DIFFERENT MENTALITY. NIXON, EISENHOWER, NOT REAGAN TO THE SAME EXTENT, BUT THOSE WERE PEOPLE THAT BELIEVED IN THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT TO DO GREAT THINGS FOR PEOPLE. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT MANIFESTATION. IT'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE -- IT'S LIKE -- I LIKEN IT TO THIS. IF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE COUNCIL OF CARDINALS, LET'S SAY 35% OF THAT WERE ATHEISTS. RIGHT.
THEY WERE LIKE LET US RUN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WE KNOW WHAT TO DO.
MIGHT BE A BAD IDEA.
IT'S THE TYPE OF NIHILISM YOU GET.
HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. A NEW DEMOCRAT ELECTED IN 1992. WE ALL CALLED SATAN. WE GOT ELECTED FOR DOING THAT IN 1994, AMERICANS SAID YOU WENT TOO FAR LEFT. WE COME ALONG WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PULL HIM TO THE CENTER WE GO TOO FAR RIGHT WE REELECT BILL CLINTON. YOU TALK ABOUT KARLL ROVE IN 2004,  WE SAW HOW WELL KARL ROVE DID IN 2012. I DON'T THINK HE COULD PLAN THAT FAR AHEAD TO CREATE THE TEA PARTY IN 2010. THAT WAS A CREATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 2009 AND 2010. NOT JUST WITH BARACK OBAMA BUT WITH GEORGE W. BUSH A BIG SPENDING REPUBLICAN WHO SPENT US INTO DEBT. HE GAVE US MEDICARE PART d.
Jon: BUT THEY DON'T EVER TALK ABOUT IT IN THAT MATTER. THEY NEVER SAY THE DEFICIT IS FROM BUSH.
THAT PISSES ME OFF. I WAS HERE IN 2004 HIS A BOOK BEFORE THE ELECTION IN 2004 I SAID BUSH IS BANKRUPTING US. HIS FOREIGN POLICY IS GOING TO BANKRUPT US. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE NEXT ELECTION AND GOING TO WRECK THE ELECONOMY. I WAS CALLED A RINOE THEN FOR WARNING ABOUT BIG GOVERNMENT REPUBLICANISM. NOW I'M BEING ATTACKED FOR WRITING THINGS LIKE THIS SAYING WE SERIOUSLY WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DRIVE THE BEER TRUCK OFF THE CLIFF. I'M SAYING THE SAME EXACT THING. I'M AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT REPUBLICANISM.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING THE PAST TEN YEARS HAVE ALL BEEN BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LISTEN TO YOU?
EXACTLY. EXACTLY. AT LEAST THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. NOW YOU KNOW! NOT YOU. I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE EVER INFLUENCED YOU BUT IT'S COMING TOGETHER, ISN'T IT?
Jon: NO! THE RIGHT PATH IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MR. JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH
