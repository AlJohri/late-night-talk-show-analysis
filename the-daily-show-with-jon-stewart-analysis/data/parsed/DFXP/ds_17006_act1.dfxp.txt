Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING? MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE'VE GOT A NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, CALVIN TRILLIN. AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK CALLED "QUITE ENOUGH OF CALVIN TRILLIN."  OH, WE'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT. (LAUGHTER) WHAT? WHY WOULD I THREATEN MY OWN GUEST? ENOUGH LEVITY, ENOUGH FRIVOLITY, ENOUGH RYE BALD GOOD HUMOR. TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING SERIOUS. (LAUGHTER) AMERICA IS AND HAS BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME AT WAR. NOW... (LAUGHTER) ... NOT THAT ONE. NO, THIS... WHY DON'T I JUST TELL YOU? NO, THAT'S NOT THE ONE! LET ME... THAT'S NOT EVEN... WHEN DID THAT START? (LAUGHTER) THAT'S NOT EVEN REAL! JUST LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IT IS! (LAUGHTER) IT'S A BATTLE FOR THE VERY SOUL OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
THE BATTLE FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IS BEING FOUGHT TODAY.
THE RAGING BATTLE IS FOR AMERICA'S FUTURE.
THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICA.
WE MUST WIN THIS BATTLE.
GET YOUR MUSKETS, AFFIX YOUR BAYONETS AND THE CHARGE IS TO THE RIGHT!
Jon: BUT BEFORE YOU CHARGE, POUR THE POWDER FROM THE POWDER HORN INTO THE BARREL AND THEN... (LAUGHTER) ... INSERT THE MUSKET BALL AND, OF COURSE, FOLLOWED BY THE WADDING, TAMP IT DOWN. TAMP, TAMP. (LAUGHTER) TAMP. DO NOT PUT IN THE WADDING FIRST. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH. (LAUGHTER) ADD SOME GUN POWDER TO THE... WHERE'S EVERYBODY GOING? (LAUGHTER) WE'RE ALMOST HALFWAY TO BEING ABLE TO SHOOT. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF OUR DEMOCRACY WITH 18th CENTURY WEAPONRY. SO TELL US, LEADERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
I'M ASKING PEOPLE TO COME TO WASHINGTON, D.C. BY THE CARLOAD.
TAKE TO THE STREETS WITH THEIR VOICES AND THEIR VOTES.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGHT TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK.
NOW IS THE TIME! LET'S GO AND LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD.
FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE CAN TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK!
Jon: ♪ AMERICA, (BLEEP) YEAH! ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW WHY I ALWAYS MAKE MYSELF THE BASS PLAYER. (LAUGHTER) WHY WOULDN'T BY LEAD GET STAR IN IT'S MY OWN AIR BAND AND YET... (LAUGHTER) I MIKE MYSELF THE BASS PLAYER. IT REALLY MAKES VERY LITTLE SENSE. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? (LAUGHTER) YES! REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER ERIC CANTOR IS RIGHT! THE PEOPLE MUST TAKE TO THE STREETS TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK! (CHANTING)
WHOSE STREETS? OUR STREETS!
THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING!
Jon: OH, MY GOD! IT'S WORKING! (LAUGHTER) ERIC CANTOR, ARE YOU SEEING THIS? THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AWAKENED BY YOUR BATTLE CRY!
I FOR ONE AM INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GROWING MOBS OCCUPYING WALL STREET AND THE  OTHER CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: OH, I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING A DEMOCRACY SOUL BATTLE. (LAUGHTER) REMEMBER, TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK! THE BAYONETS! THE CHARGING WITH THE POWDER AND THE MUSKETS. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S WHAT THE WALL STREET PROTESTORS ARE DOING. SOMEHOW THAT WRONG?
I THINK THE IDEA OF DIVIDING OUR NATION AT A TIME OF CRISIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO GO.
TALKING ABOUT MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES AND PITTING ONE GROUP AGAINST ANOTHER.
IT'S US VERSUS THEM ARGUMENT.
ONE SET OF AMERICANS AGAINST ANOTHER.
CLASS WARFARE WILL DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY MORE, WILL ATTACK JOB CREATORS, DIVIDE PEOPLE.
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOME IN THIS TOWN HAVE ACTUALLY CONDONED THE PITTING OF  AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS.
Jon: THAT WAS YOU! IT WAS, LIKE... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS... YOU DID IT RIGHT... WAIT, HOLD ON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHEN WAS THAT? IT WAS... IT WAS YOU LIKE A MINUTE AGO, REMEMBER?
THE BATTLE FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IS BEING FOUGHT TODAY WE CAN TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK.
I THINK YOU WERE WEARING THE SAME STHIRT! I KNOW IT WAS FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BUT... NOW, LOOK, IF REPUBLICANS DON'T CONDONE  PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST AMERICANS, WELL THEN WHO IS IT THAT WE AMERICANS SHOULD BE  TAKING THIS COUNTRY BACK FROM?
WHO ARE WE UP AGAINST? I WANT TO DEFINE THAT ENEMY. THEY ARE LIBERALS. THEY ARE PROGRESSIVES.
Jon: OKAY, UM... I'M PRETTY SURE THOSE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY AMERICANS.
THE ENTERTAINMENT AND NEWS MEDIA INDUSTRY.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
THE TEACHERS UNIONEDS.
THE TENURED PROFESSORS WHO CAN FLUNK YOU IF YOU ARE TOO OPENLY CONSERVATIVE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, EVERYONE YOU LISTED I BELIEVE ARE AMERICANS AND SECOND, WHERE THE BLOOP DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL? THEY CAN FLUNK YOU FOR BEING CONSERVATIVE? OH, I KNOW WHERE YOU WENT, "FICTIONAL U." GO FIGHTING FIGMENTS OF YOUR PARANOID IMAGINATION. (LAUGHTER) AND SORORITY GIRLS WHO WON'T HAVE SEX WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN. YEAH! THAT'S IT! LESBIANS. (LAUGHTER) IS THAT IT? ARE THERE ANY OTHER GROUPS THAT IT'S OKAY TO PIT AMERICANS AGAINST?
LABOR UNIONS AND THE PERSONAL INJURY TRIAL BAR.
THE S.E.I.U..
COMMUNITY ORGANIZERS.
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.
50% OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN PAY INCOME TAXES.
ACTIVIST JUDGES.
GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATES GAVE FOLKS THAT...
GAY FOLKS THAT ARE LIVING TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU KNOW, I DON'T MIND GAY FOLKS LIVING ALONE. (LAUGHTER) SOME TYPE OF ALCOVE STUDIO AND PUT UP ONE OF THEM JAPANESE DIVIDERS. YOU GOT TWO ROOMS, YOU'VE GOT A SITTING ROOM AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR (BLEEP)ING ROOM. (LAUGHTER) SEE, AS IT TURNS OUT, ON A VENN DIAGRAM, THE GROUP OF AMERICANS  THAT REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S NOT ONLY OKAY BUT NECESSARY TO PIT AMERICANS AGAINST MATCHES UP  PRETTY WELL WITH THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T VOTE REPUBLICAN. ACTUALLY, THERE'S ONLY REALLY ONE SLIVER OF PEOPLE THERE THAT REPUBLICANS HATE BUT STILL VOTE REPUBLICAN. CAN WE ZOOM IN ON THAT AND SEE WHO THAT IS? OH, MITT ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. IF YOU START ADDING UP UNIONS AND PROGRESSIVES AND LIBERALS AND PEOPLE TOO POOR PAY INCOME  TAX AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO TAX MILLIONAIRES AND...
A NEW POPL SHOWS 54% OF AMERICANS VIEW THE OCCUPY WALL STREET PROTESTS FAVORABLY. 73% FAVOR RAISING TAXES ON THOSE EARNING MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.
Jon: WOW. GOT TO BE TOUGH TO LOVE AMERICA SO MUCH BUT HATE ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN IT. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, ERIC CANTOR? YOU'RE LIKE THE ONE KID ON THE PLAYGROUND ALWAYS JUST THROWING THE DOZENS ALL DAY ABOUT  SOMEONE'S MOM. "YOUR MOM'S SO DUMB SHE THINKS FOOD STAMPS ARE WHAT YOU USE TO MAIL FOOD."  (LAUGHTER) "YOUR MOM'S SO UGLY RICHARD DAWKINS USED HER AS PROOF OF THE  NON-EXISTENCE OF GOD!" (LAUGHTER) NO, WAIT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'M ASSUMING HE GOES TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL. AND THEN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE ON THE PLAYGROUND FINALLY COMES BACK WITH "OH, YEAH? WELL, YOUR MOM'S SO FAT..." BEFORE THEY EVEN FINISH CANTOR'S LIKE "WHOA! UNCOOL! I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ALL THIS MOTHER TALK DIVIDING OUR PLAYGROUND! AND GIVE ME YOUR LUNCH MONEY, YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND
