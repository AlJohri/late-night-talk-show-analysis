Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE'S  AFGHANISTAN'S FIRST FEMALE  PARLIAMENT SPEAKER AND PLANS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN  IN 2014. HER BOOK IS CALLED "THE FAVORED  DAUGHTER:  ONE WOMAN'S FIGHT TO  LEAD AFGHANISTAN TO THE FUTURE." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  FAWZIA KOOFI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. THANK YOU FOR COMING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE  ON THIS SHOW AND THEY ARE ALL  VERY NICE. BUT YOUR STORY IS SO ASTONISHING  AND SO INSPIRING THAT I AM  EMBARRASSED. IT BEGINS WITH YOUR BIRTH AND  YOUR MOTHER FEELING LIKE BECAUSE  YOU ARE A GIRL, YOU ARE NOT WORTHY, AND THEY LEAVE YOU TO  DIE. AND YET HERE YOU ARE RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN. HOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- IT'S -- HUMBLING AND -- WALK  US THROUGH JUST A LITTLE BIT OF  THAT JOURNEY.
IT'S TRUE. ACTUALLY MY STORY IS A PART OF  MANY AFGHANISTAN WOMAN STORY BUT  THE FACT THAT I MADE IT FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR THE LIFE OF AN  AFGHAN WOMAN IS FIRST OF ALL I  WAS EDUCATED. BECAUSE MY MOTHER AS A WOMG  SUFFERED SO MUCH AND SHE DIDN'T  WANT ANOTHER WOMAN TO SUFFER AS MUCH AS SHE SUFFERED. SHE DOESN'T CARE SO MUCH WHEN I  WAS FIRSTBORN BUT SHE LATER IN  MY LIFE SHE GAVE ME ENOUGH LOVE AND SUPPORT WHEN I WENT TO  SCHOOL. BUT THE LIFE OF AFGHAN WOMAN  FROM THE TIME SHE IS BORN TO THE  TIME SHE'S MARRIED AND GOES TO HER, YOU KNOW, HUSBAND'S LIFE  AND TO THE TIME HER LIFE  FINISHES IS FULL OF STRUGGLE. IT'S CHANGED THOUGH NOW. THE TYPE OF STRUGGLE I HAD TO  DO, MY DAUGHTERS DON'T HAVE TO  DO THAT. IT'S A GENERATION CHANGE. I HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GO TO  SCHOOL AND MANY MEMBERS OF MY  FAMILY WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO GO TO SCHOOL. BUT MY DAUGHTERS HAVE A CHOICE  TO GO TO THE BEST SCHOOL IN  KABUL AND I THINK BECAUSE OF THE SOCIAL CHANGES IN AFGHANISTAN. IT'S HARDLY MESH YOU'RABLE TO BE  REPORTED IN MEDIA BECAUSE IT'S  NOT MEASURABLE. WITH ALL THE CHANGES THAT HAS  HAPPENED, I GIVE MYSELF ALL  ELIGIBILITY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF AFGHANISTAN.
Jon: IT'S TREMENDOUS. WHEN YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE SOCIAL  CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER  THAT GENERATION, YET, YOUR LIFE REMAINS IN PERIL ON A DAILY  BASIS. THE TALIBAN HAS TRIED TO  ASSASSINATE YOU MANY DIFFERENT  TIMES. AND YOU SEEM REMARKABLY SERENE  IN THE FACE AFTER THIS KIND OF  DANGER. IS THAT JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE  A FAITH THAT YOU BELIEVE THIS IS  YOUR DESTINY THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST DO EVEN WITH THE PERIL IT  PUTS YOU IN?
IT'S A CHOICE. I COULD COME TO EUROPE OR U.S. AND STAY LUXURIOUS LIFE LIKE  MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD  DO OR I COULD STAY BACK IN MY COUNTRY AND TRY TO CONTRIBUTE TO  A SMALL CHANGE IF I CAN. I HAVE DECIDED TO GO FOR THE  SECOND OPTION THOUGH IT'S NOT  EASY. I FEEL AS A WOMAN IF YOU BECOME  STRONGER POLITCALLY OR SOCIALLY  YOU FIND MORE OPPONENTS. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT WANT YOU NOT  TO BE IN THIS WORLD. THERE'S BEEN WOMAN THAT I --  THAT I HAD TO FACE INSURGENCY  FACE TO FACE. THEY TRIED TO KILL ME. I WAS UNDER ATTACK FOR HALF AN  HOUR. BUT STILL I -- YOU KNOW I THINK  AFGHANISTAN NEEDS PEOPLE WHO  BRING CHANGE FOR THE PEOPLE AND I THINK -- AGAIN, I SEE MYSELF  PART OF THE AGENT OF CHANGE IN  AFGHANISTAN. AND AFGHANISTAN IS NOT ONLY A  COUNTRY WHERE YOU HEAR ABOUT WAR  IT'S A COUNTRY FULL OF VALUES AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN IT IN  ONE SPECIAL.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S A RELATIONSHIP AND  VALUE. THAT IS THE FACE OF AFGHANISTAN  I WOULD LIKE TO DEMONSTRATE TO  THE WORLD WHICH IS NOT ONLY A COUNTRY THAT YOU DON'T NATE TO  BUT A COUNTRY THAT COULD BE  RELIABLE IN THE WORLD. THE NEW GENERATION IS DOING AN  ENORMOUSLY WONDERFUL JOB TRYING  TO MAKE SURE THAT AFGHANISTAN�� DOESN'T ONCE AGAIN FALL IN THE  HANDS OF EXTREMISM OR  RADICALISM. THE FACT THAT I WAS LISTENING TO  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S STATE OF THE  UNION ADDRESS LAST NIGHT, IT'S PROMISING TO SEE AFGHANISTAN IS  PART OF FOREIGN POLICY BUT ON  THE OTHER HAND, TROOP WITHDRAWAL IS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE AND IN  AFGHANISTAN THERE'S CONCERN OF  WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE PURSUING OF THE PEACE PROCESS. THERE'S HOPES AND CONCERNS AS  WELL. I WANT TO BE PART OF HOPE FOR MY  COUNTRY. I KNOW THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND  ONE DAY I MIGHT BE ASSASSINATED  BUT IT'S A CHOICE I MADE FOR  MYSELF.
Jon: INSPIRING ONE AND  INCREDIBLY BRAVE ONE. ENOUGH TIME WE'LL GOOD TO  COMMERCIAL AND WE'LL TALK MORE  ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES ANT DUEALITY OF LIVING IN  AFGHANISTAN AND THE DIFFICULTY  AS YOU GO THROUGH THERE. VERY, VERY NICE TO HAVE YOU ON  THE SHOW. FAWZIA KOOFI, "THE FAVORED  DAUGHTER."  YOU SHE HAD GUT THIS AND READ  IT. SHE'S PRETTY A
