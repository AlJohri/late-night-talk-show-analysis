NOVEMBER 8, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST IS GOING TO BE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BILL CLINTON. I'M GOING TO GET RIGHT TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING THE INTERVIEW MIGHT GO LONG! (LAUGHTER) LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE ECONOMY. THE OCCUPY WALL STREET PROTESTS HAVE REMINDED AMERICANS OF TWO THING: ONE, THE UNCHECKED  EXCESSES OF THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND, TWO, JUST HOW FEW PUBLIC TOILET FACILITIES THERE  ARE IN LOWER MANHATTAN. (LAUGHTER) CAN A BROTHER GET A BATHROOM UP IN THIS BITCH? NO BATHROOM? COME ON! BUT ADDRESSING INCOME INEQUALITY AND UNRAVELING THE COMPLEX AND OFTEN TIMES CORRUPT RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATIONS IS GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN SUSTAINED  RHYTHMIC DRUMMING WOULD SUGGEST. (LAUGHTER) WALL STREET EXECUTIVES BECOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TASKED WITH  REGULATING WALL STREET COMPANIES THAT THEY WILL SOON BE HIRED TO LOBBY FOR. IT'S A CONFUSING... IF ONLY ONE MAN COULD EMBODY THE CORPORATE  INDUSTRIAL GOVERNMENT COMPLEX IN ALL ITS CLUSTER (BLEEP)ITUDE. (LAUGHTER) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR, NEW  JERSEY SENATOR, AND GOLDMAN SACHS C.E.O. JON CORZINE!
WE NEED TO HAVE REGULATORS WHO ARE PRO-ACTIVE IN OVERSEEING A SYSTEM. SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE JUDGMENTS BEFORE THE FACT INSTEAD OF AFTER THE FACT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMATIC OVERSIGHT OF THE DERIVATIVES MARKET. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PUSHBACK BUT THAT'S WHEN STRONG REGULATION HAS TO BE IN PLACE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M NOT SPARKLY HANDING, I'M DRYING MY MANICURE. THAT'S FORMER WALL STREET C.E.O. TURNED POLITICIAN JONTOR SINE CALLING FUR TOUGHER FINANCIAL REGULATIONS TO PREVENT THE  CATASTROPHIC 2008 FINANCIAL FIRM MELTDOWNS THAT DESTROYED OUR ECONOMY. BUT, OF COURSE, POLITICIAN JON CORZINE LOST THE 2009 GUBERNATORIAL RACE IN NEW JERSEY  TO 2016 PRESIDENTIAL WINNER CHRIS CHRISTIE. (LAUGHTER) LUCKY FOR CORZINE, HE STILL HAD THAT WALL STREET C.E.O. THING TO FALL BACK ON.
M.F. GLOBAL, A FINANCIAL FIRM RUN BY FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR JON CORZINE, HAS FILED  FOR BANKRUPTCY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HELLO GRADUATE SCHOOL! WELL, THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS... SETTLE DOWN. THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT SO HORRIFIED CORZINE WAS CAUSED BY RISKY BETS ON BAD DEBT. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT WHAT CAUSED CORZINE'S COMPANY TO COLLAPSE IN 2011 WAS THE GREAT  INTEGRITY WITH WHICH HE CONDUCTED HIS BUSINESS. WHICH WAS ANATHEMA TO THE CASINO-LIKE ATMOSPHERE ON WALL STREET AND THE FAT CATS WHO  RESENTED CORZINE'S SURPLUS OF WISDOM. CUE WHAT HAPPENED.
THE COMPANY AT HIS BEHEST MADE BIG BETS ON EUROPEAN BONDS, EUROPEAN DEBT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EUROPE.
$6.3 BILLION WAS INVESTED IN THE DEBT OF ITALY, SPAIN, PORTUGAL, AND IRELAND. ALL COUNTRIES NOW CONSIDERED IN SEVERE ECONOMIC TROUBLE. (LAUGHTER) YOU BET IT ALL ON RISKY EUROPEAN DEBT, AND YOU LOST. (LAUGHTER) SURPRISE. IT'S LIKE PLAYING ROULETTE AND PUTTING ALL YOUR MONEY ON PURPLE. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, LET'S CALM DOWN HERE. LET'S CALM DOWN. LET'S CALM DOWN. SOMETIMES RISK RISKY BETS PAY OFF. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TAKE CHANCES TO MOVE CAPITAL. THE ISSUE, CORZINE HAD WITH FINANCIAL COMPANIES LIKE LEHMAN AND BEAR STEARNS WASN'T SO MUCH  THE RISKY BETS, IT WAS HOW LITTLE COLLATERAL, CASH ON HAND, THAT THEY HAD TO SUPPORT THOSE BETS. SO EVEN A SMALL MISTAKE COULD BRING DOWN AN ENTIRE FIRM. I BELIEVE THE STREET TERM IS "OVERLEVERAGED."
I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE LEVERAGE IS.
EXTRA LEVERAGE BEYOND REASONABLE BOUNDS IS WHAT HAS GOTTEN US INTO THIS PROBLEM.
THE MORE TRANSPARENCY, THE MORE CONTROLS ON LIQUIDITY, THE MORE CONTROLS WITH REGARD TO  EXCESSIVE LEVERAGE THAT BUILD UP IN THE SYSTEM IS THE KIND OF REGULATORY SCHEME WE NEED. I SUPPORT IT.
Jon: THAT IS JON CORZINE GNCHTS. (LAUGHTER) IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR CLAMORING FOR REGULATION TO PREVENT WALL  STREET FIRMS FROM DOING THIS.
M.F. GLOBAL WAS LEVERAGED AT A RACE OF 40-1. THAT MEANS FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF EQUITY IT HAD, IT HELD NEARLY NEARLY $40 OF DEBT.
TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE, LEHMAN BROTHERS HAD LEVERAGE OF ABOUT 30 OR 33-1.
Jon: MOTHER (BLEEP)ER! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET ME JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT. (LAUGHTER) POLITICIAN JON CORZINE SAW LEHMAN BROTHERS AS A CAUTIONARY TALE. FINANCIAL FIRM HONCHO JON CORZINE SAW IT AS A DARE. (LAUGHTER) 30-1? PUSSIES. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, NO, IT'S NOT HIS FAULT  FAULT. CORZINE JUST COULDN'T RESIST THE SWEET NECTAR OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. (LAUGHTER) BUT I'M WONDERING, WHAT DID POLITICIAN JOHN CORZINE SAY ABOUT C.E.O.s WHO TRY AND  CIRCUMVENT REGULATION AGAIN?
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PUSHBACK, BUT THAT'S WHEN STRONG REGULATION HAS TO BE IN PLACE.
Jon: AND WHAT DID M.F. GLOBAL HEAD JOHN CORZINE DO VIS-A-VIS BEING REGULATED? WELL, WHEN THE FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENT TOLD HIM HE NEEDED MORE CAPITAL TO LOWER HIS  LEVERAGE HE WENT OVER THEIR HEAD AND LOBBIED THE S.E.C. TO MAKE THE REGULATORS GO AWAY. WHICH APPARENTLY ON WALL STREET IS AN OPTION. LIKE WHEN A COP ASKS YOU OR KNOW STEP OUT OF OUR VEHICLE AND WE CALL THE POLICE COMMISSIONER AND  GO "HEY, GET THIS JACKASS OFF MY BEHIND! I GOT PLACES TO GO, THAT'S WHY I WAS SPEEDING!" (LAUGHTER) NOW, IN CASE ALL OF THIS IS  MAKING YOU DEPRESSED, GIVING YOU THE SENSE THAT WALL STREET IS A VAST A VINO WHERE GAMBLERS RISK  YOUR LIFE SAVINGS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES, REST ASSURED, CORZINE ISN'T WALKING AWAY SCOT-FREE. HE'S PAYING A HEAVY PRICE.
JON CORZINE HAS RESIGNED AS C.E.O. OF M.F. GLOBAL.
HE'S GIVING UP WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A $12 MILLION SEVERANCE PACKAGE BUT IT'S  UNCLEAR IF HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT SEVERANCE ANYWAY.
Jon: THAT IS RIGHT! NOT ONLY WILL JON CORZINE RUN THE COMPANY HA DOES NOT EXIST ANY LONGER HEX ALSO WILL NOT  RECEIVE ANY OF THE MONEY IT DOES NOT HAVE. (LAUGHTER) WITHOUT THAT $12 MILLION, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO SCRAPE BY ON  THE $150 TO $400 MILLION HE HAS ALREADY EARNED. I GUESS FROM NOW ON HE'LL BE RIDING HOME ON THE BUS-- JET, THAT HE HAD
