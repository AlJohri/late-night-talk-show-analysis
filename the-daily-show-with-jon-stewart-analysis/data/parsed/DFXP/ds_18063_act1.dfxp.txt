FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, OH, MY GOD! HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE  DAILY SHOW". ANY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY NAME IS JON STEWART AND I  NEED A HAIRCUT. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE LONGEST HEAD I'VE  EVER HAD. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT A NICE ONE. THE ACTRESS ALISON BRIE WILL BE  JOINING US FROM THE HIT SHOW  "COMMUNITY."  P MY GUESS IS SHE'LL IN NO WAY TELL US WHAT IS GOING ON THERE  BUT I'M EXCITED. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH  AMERICA. AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE  REFERENCE. I PUT THAT UP THERE TO LET YOU  KNOW. REMEMBER THAT MAP FROM THE  PLACEMAT AT HOWARD JOHNSONS. [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU KNOW, OUR COUNTRY HAS  BEEN ON A DIFFICULT RUN. GAS PRICES HAVE RISEN STEADILY  OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. OUR PRESIDENT IS UNSURE WHETHER  HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TARGET  AMERICANS ON OUR MAINLANDSLANDS WITH  MISSILES. AND GERALDO IS THINKING OF  RUNNING FOR SENATE. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH RUN. WE DECIDED TO DO A SEGMENT AIMED  AT BOASTING OUR MORALE CALLED WE  MAY BE (bleep) BUT -- LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU. LET'S BEGIN WITH HORSEMEAT.
IMAGINE BUYING FROZEN  HAMBURGERS AND LITTER  DISCOVERING THAT THE PATTIES YOU ASSUMED WERE BEEF WERE GROUND  HORSE MEAT.
Jon: EWW. [LAUGHTER] YOU WON'T ME TO TOUCH WHERE YOU? [LAUGHTER] -- ME TO TOUCH YOU WHERE? THAT'S WHERE YOU GO TO THE  BATHROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. WHEN I BUY FROZEN GROUND BEEF I  EXPECT MACHINE SHREDDED COW  FILLED WITH 25% LIGAMENT AND CARTILAGE MIXED BACK WITH THE  OTHER STUFF I DON'T KNOW WHAT  IT'S THERE. GRADE A GROUND BEEF. THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT. NOTHING IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE  QUEEN OF BBC. A LOT OF PEOPLE EAT HORSE. GOOD HONEST PEOPLE.
HORSE MEAT IS EAT MONEY IN A  LOT OF COUNTRIES INCLUDING  FRANCE, ITALY, KAZAKHSTAN.
Jon: OKAY. I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT  THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU PEOPLE  THAT ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES YOU  MENTIONED IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS IN TERMS OF THEIR  WORLDWIDE CUISINE. SO MY VICE IF YOU FIND YOURSELF  IN AN INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF  HORSE MEAT AND YOUR CHOICE IS DISHESWISE ARE EQUAIN  BOURGUIGNON, RIS SOTO ALA  HORSEMEAT OR CAZZIC FRIED BUCKET OF HORSE. -- CHAAK FRIED -- BUCKET OF  HORSE -- I DIDN'T KNOW WE'D SEE  THE WHOLE FACE. THE SCANDAL CAME TO LIGHT WHEN  THE EUROPE VERSIONS OF BURGER  KING BECAME EMBROILED -- [LAUGHTER] -- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
THE HORSE MEAT IN QUESTION  WAS SOURCED AT TWO PLACES IN  ROMANIA.
Jon: WOW. WHAT KIND OF WORLD DO WE LIVE IN  WHERE WE CAN NO LONGER TRUST THE  PRODUCT PURITY, THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF TRANSSILL --  TRANSYLVANIAN MEAT SLAUGHTER  HOUSES. DRACULA WOULD ROLL OVER IN HIS  DAY BED.
SHARP REACTION FROM THE  ROMANIAN PRIME MINISTER.
I'M VERY ANGRY TO BE VERY  HONEST.
Jon: THAT DOES NOT SEEM  SHARP. YOU SEEMED MORE BEMUSED THAN  ANGRY. IT'S A TRYING NOT TO LAUGH  PHASE. IF YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN DOING  THIS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS  LAUGHING WHILE EUROPE'S WEALTHIER UNKNOWINGLY EAT OUR  INFORM PLOW HORSES -- BY THE  WAY, ME ROMANIAN, WE PLAY JOKE, WE PUT PEE PEE IN YOUR COKE. [LAUGHTER] DON'T WORRY. WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE FUN  TODAY. THE PRIME MINISTER OF ROMANIA  DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. WE NEED A VILLAIN.
ANOTHER FIGURE WITH A MURKY  HISTORY IS THIS MAN.
Jon: WORST J-DATE PICTURE  EVER. THAT DUDE IS SAY VILLAIN. CHECK THAT GUY OUT. ADDING HORSE MEAT TO HAMBURGERS  LOOKS LIKE THE LEAST SLADEY  THING THIS GUY HAS DONE. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO  RUFFI HIMSELF. WHAT COULD I DO? DID YOU SEE WHAT I WAS WEAR  SOMETHING IN I WAS ASKING FOR  IT. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, I'M GLAD THEY -- I DON'T  KNOW WHAT THAT ACCENT WAS, BY  THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GLAD THEY FOUND THIS OUT AND  THEY CAN PUT A STOP TO WHAT I'M  ASSUMING IS A WIDESPREAD  PROBLEM.
1% OF THE PRODUCTS TESTED, 29  OUT OF 2501 CAME BACK SHOWING  POSITIVE FOR HORSE DNA.
Jon: THAT AIN'T NOTHING. THAT'S LESS THAN 1% HORSE. THAT'S THE KIND OF MILK I BUY. 1 PRS HORSE IS THE WORLD'S  LAMEST CENTUR. OF COURSE INVOLUNTARY HORSE  SNACKING ONE OF THE THINGS  AMERICANS DIDN'T HAVE TONE DURING LAST WEEK.
IN A REMOTE PART OF RUSSIA A  METEOR TRAVELED TO EARTH AND  EXPLODED.
IT CARRIED A CONTRAIL AND HIT  THE ATMOSPHERE AND EXPLODED WITH  THE FORCE OF AN ATOMIC BOMB.
Jon: ON THE BRIGHT SIDE DID  IT PROVIDE RUSSIA WITH A  FLEETING SENSE OF WARMTH. [LAUGHTER] THIS WAS SCARY NOT LIKE A SOLAR  ECLIPSE. YEAH. WASN'T LIKE A SOLAR ECLIPSE. NO ONE KNEW IT WAS COMING. HOW DID THESE RUSSIANS GET THE  FOOTAGE?
A MAJORITY WAS RECORDED  PURELY BY CHANCE, CAPTURED BY  SMALL DASH MOUNTED CAMERAS THAT ARE THE LATEST FAD AMONG RUSSIAN  CAR OWNERS.
Jon: LET'S ROLL THE CAMERA  AGAIN WITH THE SOUND UP. I'M GOING TO LEARN THE RUSSIAN  FOR HOLY (bleep) BALL. [RADIO NOISE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE GUY IN THE CAR  DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING. THAT'S MORE AMAZING THAN THE  FOOTAGE ITSELF. THE GUY IN THE CAR IS COMPLETELY  UNIMPRESSED BY A DEATH ROCK  HURLING TOWARDS THE CITY. IS EVERYONE IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY  JUST THAT JADED?
MOTORISTS HAVE TURNED TO DASH  CAMS FOR SELF PROTECTION. VISUAL PROOF TO FEND OFF CHARGES  FROM POSSIBLEIBLY CORRUPT POLICE  OFFICERS AND FROM INSURANCE SCAMMERS WHO OFTEN STAGE  ACCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE CAPTURED  HERE.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD, THAT MAN NEEDS HELP. GET HIM TO ENSEMBLE STUDIO  THEATER STAT. HE NEEDS 300CC'S OF ACTOR-ALL. [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK WHAT WE SEEM TO BE  LEARNING IS THAT RUSSIANS IN THE  COURSE OF THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES SEE SO MUCH CRAZY (bleep)  THEY'VE BECOME UNPHASABLE. THEY'VE LONG BEEN ACCUSTOM TO  THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE  RUSSIAN CAR CAN EASILY BE TORN APART BY YOUR AVERAGE RUSSIAN  WOMAN. I WANT BUMPER. [ LAUGHTER ] PUT CHEESE ON, EAT. MMMMM. I MEAN THIS TYPICAL ROADSIDE  SCENE TWO DRIVERS CONFRONT EACH  OTHER WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND YES, THAT IS A HATCHET. [ LAUGHTER ] RUSSIA IS LIKE A LIVE ACTION  GRAND THEFT AUTO. [ LAUGHTER ] IF THERE'S A SURPRISING PART OF  THE VIDEO IS THAT THOSE  GENTLEMEN ARRIVED AT SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT NOT TO BAT AND  HATCHET EACH OTHER TO DEATH. APPARENTLY IN RUSSIA IT'S COMMON  FOR YOUR COMMUTE TO INVOLVE A  HATCHET BAT DISPUTE, A FIGHTER JET FLY BY OR I DON'T KNOW BANG! [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW UNPHASED ARE RUSSIANS? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: EVEN THE COWS -- THIS  IS HOW UNPHASED RUSSIANS ARE,  EVEN THEIR COWS IN A MASS COW TIPPING JUST (bleep) GET UP  AND ARE LIKE -- [LAUGHTER] YES, FOLKS AMERICA MAY BE  (bleep) BUT NOT AS BAD AS  THIS. ♪ ♪  SNOW  ♪ ♪  ♪ ♪
