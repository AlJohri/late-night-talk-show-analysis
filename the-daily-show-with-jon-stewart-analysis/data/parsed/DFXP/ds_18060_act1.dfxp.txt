FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT  TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT MIKE PIAZZA,  THE GREATEST HITTING CATCHER OF  ALL TIME! ALL TIME! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOGA BERRA, THE GREATEST OF ALL  TIME. HIS NAME IN ENGLISH MEANS MIKE  TOWNSQUARE. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER FROM  HERE, FOLKS. [LAUGHTER] LOWER THOSE EXPECTATIONS IF YOU  WOULD. [ LAUGHTER ] LISTEN AN HOUR OR SO AGO BECAUSE  I  PRESIDENT OBAMA WRAPPED UP THE  FIRST SECOND TERM STATE OF UNION  ADDRESS. WE'LL BRING YOU COMPLETE TEAM  COVERAGE THERE TOMORROW. [ LAUGHTER ] SPOILER ALERT THERE THE STATE OF  THE UNION, YOU KNOW, FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, CUMSECUMSA. JUST THIS MORNING WE WERE  REMINDED ABOUT HOW THESE PLEA  PLANNED POLITICAL EVENTS COULD BE EQUIPPED. EVIL THREATENS OUR VERY DEM  CINCH AFTER MY INTERVIEW WITH  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DICK  CHENEY.
Jon: YEAH! YOU THOUGHT I WAS TALKING ABOUT  NORTH KOREA NUKE TEST. NO, NO, NO MY BROTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AND  PROFESSIONAL FROWN HOARDER  RICHARD P. CHENEY SHOWED UP ON TV THIS MORNING. HE DOESN'T HAVE A NEW BOOK,  PROBABLY JUST PROMOTING HIS NEW  MOVIE ZERO DARK THIRTY. FEEL GOOD PICTURE OF YEAR. MAKES THE DENTIST SEEN IN  MARATHON MAN LOOK LIKE A TICKLE  FIGHT. I GIVE IT FOUR. WHY ARE WE WASTING OUR BANDWITH  ON THIS GUY. WHAT HE IS DOING KILLING TIME  WHILE HE IS HAVING HIS HOUSE  REPIX LATED.
YOU THINK THIS PRESIDENT IS  WEAKENING AMERICA?
YES I, DO.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IF  THEY WERE LISTENING TO YOU NOW  AS THEY WILL.
I DOUBT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY  THERE'S A SAYING EVERY TIME DICK  CHENEY LAUGHS, AN ANGEL GETS STABBED IN THE (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A VISUAL  FOR THAT BUT -- [LAUGHTER] SORRY FORMER VICE PRESIDENT YOU  WERE CRITICIZING.
THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES  ARE TERRIBLY FLAWED. THE PRESIDENT CAME TO POWER WITH  A WORLD VIEW THAT IS  FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CHOICES  IN PART BASED ON PEOPLE WHO  WON'T ARGUE WITH HIM. HE WANTED TO REDUCE U.S. INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD. HE WANTED TO TAKE US DOWN A PEG.
Jon: CHENEY IS CONFIDENT IN  HIS OPINIONS AND ANALYSIS I  GUESS BY FORGETTING THAT HE SUCKED AT THIS. LIKE HE WAS THE (bleep). EVEN IF OBAMA WANTED TO TAKE OUR  STANDING IN THE WORLD DOWN A  PEG, I COULDN'T BECAUSE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION LEFT HIM WITH NO  PEG ROOM. HE COULD HAVE INVESTED IN DEEP  SEA PEG HOLE DRILLING TECHNOLOGY  BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE CAN'T AFFORD TO BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS  ADMINISTRATION LEFT US IN A BIT  OF A CASH CRUNCH AND BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION I MEAN THESE  (bleep). HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW --  WHERE WITH THE CONFIDENT  CRITICISM IN THE THING WHERE HE DID GET THE BALLS AND PLEASE  DON'T SAY CADAVERS. REMEMBER THIS, MR. VICE  PRESIDENT?
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT SADDAM  HUSSEIN HAS WEAPONS OF MASS  DESTRUCTION.
Jon: NOT ONLY THERE ARE  THERE NO JOBS THERE WERE NO  WEAPONS.
WE'LL BE GREETED AS  LIBERATORS.
Jon: WE WERE NOT.
I THINK THEY ARE IN THE LAST  THROES OF THE INSURGENCY.
Jon: TURNS OUT THE  BEGINNING TO THE MIDDLE OF  THROES. THERE'S QUITE A FEW THROES. THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH THE CHIEF  EXPORT AFTER THAT. THIS GUY WAS WRONG EVERY TIME,  EVERY TIME HE ANALYZED IT HE WAS  WRONG. YOU TRY THAT AT WORK AND SEE IF  YOU KEEP YOUR JOB AND BE WRONG  EVERY (bleep) TIME. THERE'S NO DOUBT YOU HAVE  OVARIAN CYSTS. I'M A MAN, WA, WA. THERE'S NO DOUBT. I AM SURE YOU NEED TIRES. THERE'S NO DOUBT WE HAVE  INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED, WAH,  NEW TIRES, WAH. REALLY BECAUSE IT'S A BOAT! WHY WOULD BE LISTEN TO THAT GUY? BACK IN THE WORLD THAT MATTERS.
JUST HOURS AGO SEISMIC  ACTIVITY EQUIVALENT TO A 4.9  MAGNITUDE.
QUAKE WAS DETECTED IN NORTH  KOREA.
Jon: OH, MY GOD IT KNOCKED  OUT POWER TO THE ENTIRE REGION. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. OKAY I'M TOLD THAT'S HOW IT  ALWAYS LOOKS AX APPARENTLY NORTH  KOREA DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF  LIGHT. ANYWAY THAT'S A PRETTY BIG  EARTHQUAKE THERE. I HOPE IT WASN'T NEAR NORTH  KOREA'S NUCLEAR SITES -- WAIT A  MINUTE.
NORTH KOREA SET OFF A NEW  UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TEST THAT  HAPPENED TODAY.
Jon: OH, NO, POGASARI HAS  AWOKEN. IT'S ALIVE! [LAUGHTER] YOU PROBABLY THINKING, YOU KNOW,  JON, THAT GENRE OF GIANT  RADIOACTIVE LIZARD MONSTERS IS REALLY JAPANESE, TOTALLY  DIFFERENT CULTURE. WELL TAKE THIS IT WAS A NORTH  KOREA LIZARD. AND IT SOMEHOW CAME IN CONTACT  WITH BLOOD AND GREW. LAUGH ALL YOU WANT BUT IT MADE  BIG WANDS IN NORTH KOREAAL. IT'S AMAZING WHAT MANDATORY FILL  AM TENDANCE DID DO FOR THE BOX  OFFICE. I'M SURE THE BOMB ISN'T THAT  TECHNOLOGY LOGICALLY ADVANCED.
THE NORTH KOREAS CLAIM THEY  DID IT A SMALLER DEVICE PERHAPS  MEANING THEY MADE PROGRESS IN MINIMUM TOURIZING NUCLEAR  WEAPONS. OH, NO THE BOMB IS SMALLER. HOLD ON --
Jon: THAT IS SUPPOSED TO  CARE US. EVEN KNOW MINIMUM TOURIZING  THINGS MAKES THEM MORE ADORE  YAFNL MINI SNICKERS, MINI HORSES, MINI COOPER. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING ABOUT  THE CAR BUT A MINI ANDERSON  COOPER IS REALLY -- I BET A RITZ CRACKER WOULD BE A WHOLE MEAL  FOR THEM. HE COULD COVER MASSIVE SNOW  STORMS. REPORT ON THE INAUGURATION OF  AMERICA'S FIRST MOUSE PRESIDENT. LOOK AT HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? OH, NORTH KOREA AND THEIR  NUCLEAR WEAPONS. WHAT COULD THEY DO TO US?
PERHAPS MEANING THAT THEY  HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN MINIMUM  TOURIZING NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT COULD BE PUT ON THE TOP OF  BALLISTIC MISSILES THAT COULD  ULTIMATELY THREATEN THE UNITED  STATES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: (bleep) THAT'S  DEPRESSING. I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO CHEER  ME UP THERE. IS THAT MINI ANDERSON COOPER  EATING A RITZ CRACKER IN A
