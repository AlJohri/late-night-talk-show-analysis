AS YOU KNOW, TONIGHT'S  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WASN'T THE  ONLY HIGH-PROFILE VERBAL DUST-UP  SCHEDULED THE TAKE PLACE THIS  WEEK. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE RUMBLE IN  THE AIR CONDITIONED AUDITORIUM. DID THAT REVERB AT ALL? TWO MEN ENTER, TWO MEN LEAVE. LAUGHTER  ONE SLIGHTLY BEFORE THE OTHER  ONE. IT'S ALL GOING DOWN IN D.C. THIS  SATURDAY NIGHT. STREAM IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, OR  BETTER YET, SEPARATELY. [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUSLY WITH THREE DAYS TO GO,  I'M GOING THE MEADE SOME DEBATE  PREP FACING OFF AGAINST  O'REILLY, BUT WHO COULD POSSIBLY STAND IN FOR MAN LIKE THE PAPA  BEAR, A RIGHT-WING  TRADITIONALIST WHO ISN'T AFRAID  TO PEEK HIS MIND, AN AMERICAN WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY MORE THAN  HE LOVES HIMSELF, AND HE REALLY  LOVES HIMSELF QUITE A BIT? WHO COULD FILL THOSE SHOES? IT'S NO ONE, NO ONE. ♪♪   ♪♪ [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE CHANTING "STEPHEN"] JON JON YOU WORKING OUT? WOW. I AM SHOCKED. WOW.
Stephen: EXCUSE ME.
Jon: I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
Stephen: I CAN'T HEAR A  WORD. MAY I BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE,  JON?
Jon: I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU  BE HERE. LET'S DO THIS.
Stephen: GUNTER, BJORN,  STAND DOWN. ALL RIGHT, JON, GET YOURSELF A  PODIUM. LET'S DO THIS THING.
Jon: OH, YOU WANT ME TO GET  A PODIUM? OKAY. I GUESS I'LL GET ONE THEN. OKAY. JUST SON OF A...
Stephen: DON'T HELP HIM. DON'T HELP HIM.
Jon: OH, SON OF A...
Stephen: ALL RIGHT.
Jon: OH, MY GOD.
Stephen: JON, YOU HAVE  ALREADY MADE YOUR FIRST MISTAKE. YOU ALLOWED ME TO MAKE A BIGGER  ENTRANCE THAN YOU.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S DO THIS. YOU GOT THE PLAY O'REILLY IN  THIS.
Stephen: I'LL TRY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU GOT TO EMBODY A  LARGER-THAN-LIFE CONSERVATIVE  PUNDIT.
Stephen: I LOVE NEW  CHALLENGE, JON. LET'S DO THIS THING. WILL LYING THIS CANDLE.
Jon: LET'S START WITH A  TOPIC. AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
Stephen: PERFECT, JON. THAT'S ACTUALLY FIRST CHAPTER OF  MY NEW BOOK "AMERICA AGAIN:  REBECOME THE GREATNESS WE NEVER  WEREN'T" RELEASED YESTERDAY AND AVAILABLE IN AUDIO BOOK, E-BOOK  AND BOOK BOOK. "AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL. DOES THAT STATEMENT SHOCK YOU? IT SHOCKED ME TO HAVE TO SAY IT. TO BE FORCED BY YOUR DOUBT TO  SAY OUT LOUD THAT AMERICA IS  EXCEPTIONAL IMPLIES SOMETHING  UGLY. IT'S LIKE TELLING THE HOST OF A  DINNER PARTY, I'M CERTAIN YOUR  WIFE IS A FEMALE." [LAUGHTER] "SAYING IT OUT LOUD FEELS WRONG,  NO MATTER HOW LARGE HER HANDS  ARE.
Jon: WOW. WOW. THAT WAS BEAT OPENING. THAT WAS FANTASTIC.
Stephen: YOU JUST LOST,  JON. NEVER COMPLIMENT YOUR OPPONENT. REMEMBER THE DEBATE A, B,  Cs -- ALWAYS BE ATTACKING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK YOU'RE  MISSPELLING ATTACKING.
Stephen: ARE YOU SAYING THE  WORD "ATTACKING" DOESN'T HAVE  THE LETTER C IN IT?
Jon: OF COURSE IT HAS A "C"  IN IT.
Stephen: YOU JUST LOST  AGAIN. NEVER ADMIT YOUR OPPONENT IS  RIGHT, EVEN OR ESPECIALLY IF IT  IS. THAT'S A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. THEY WILL GO FOR THE THROAT.
Jon: I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID,  STEPHEN, I'M NOT SURE I AGREE  WITH YOUR LARGER POINT.
Stephen: CAN I INTERRUPT  YOU AGAIN?
Jon: YES.
Stephen: NEVER EVER LET  SOMEONE INTERRUPT YOU.
Jon: I'M BAD AT THIS.
Stephen: NO [BLEEPED],  SHYLOCK.
Jon: YOU MEAN SHERLOCK?
Stephen: SURE. YOU'RE IN WORSE SHAPE THAN I  THOUGHT. GUNTHER, FETCH ME CLUCKER  CARLSON. THANK YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: IT'S JON. HE'S MAN-EATER, JON. BE CAREFUL. FROM NOW UNTIL SATURDAY, JON,  YOU MUST DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL  YOU. NO QUESTIONS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: I'M GOING TO  RELEASE THIS CHICKEN, GORGEOUS  AMERICAN-BRED HEN INTO YOUR  STUDIO AND YOU MUST CATCH IT.
Jon: OH, OKAY. "ROCKIMENT" AND THEN ONCE I  CATCH THE CHICKEN, I AM READY TO  DEBATE.
Stephen: NO. NO, NO, JON. FIRST YOU CATCH THE CHICKEN.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
Stephen: THEN YOU MUST USE  THE CHICKEN...
Jon: YES?
Stephen:...TO WAX A CAR. WAX ON. WAX OFF.
Jon: OKAY.
Stephen: THERE'S A GRAY  AUDI S-5 PARKED OUTSIDE THE  STUDIO RIGHT NOW.
Jon: I SEE, A GRAY AUDI  S-5. SO AFTER I USE THE CHICKEN TO  WASH YOUR CAR, AM ID AREDY?
Stephen: NO, JON. NOT EVEN CLOSE, BECAUSE TO  DEFEAT BILL O'REILLY, YOU MUST  FIRST CATCH THE BIRD, WAX MY  CAR, THEN TO ABSORB ITS SOUL, YOU MUST THEN MAKE THIS BIRD  INTO A CHICK-FIL-A SANDWICH.
Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
Stephen: YES.
Jon: NO, THAT IS COMPLETELY  ABSURD.
Stephen: DO YOU WANT TO  WIN?
Jon: I DO WANT THE WIN.
Stephen: THEN LET THE  TRAINING BEGIN.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT  EASIER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED.
Stephen: THE STUDENT HAS  BECOME THE MASTER. LET'S GO WAX THAT CAR!
Jon: LET'S DO IT. STEPHEN COLBERT, EVERYBODY.
Stephen: GUNTHER, LET'S
