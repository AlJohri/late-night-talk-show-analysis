JANUARY 12, 2011 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HUSBAND HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS  "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO ONE AND ALL TO "THE DAILY SHOW". WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. FORMER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR TIM PAWLENTY WILL BE JOINING US ONCE HE FINISHES SHOVELING OUR WALK. BOOM! ACTUALLY HE'S FROM MINNESOTA. IT WAS HIS IDEA HE JUST --  [LAUGHTER] SAYS IT JUST MAKES HIM FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. THE NEWS IN AMERICA LATELY HAS NOT BEEN, I GUESS THE WORD WOULD BE GOOD, AND IT'S NO BETTER ABROAD. THERE'S TERRIBLE FLOODING IN AUSTRALIA. GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE IN LEBANON, RIOTS IN TUNISIA -- WHAT THE -- WAIT. THESE PEOPLE ARE SMILING AND DANCING. WHERE IS THIS HAPPY PLACE FILLED WITH JOY AND DANCING? I'M BEING TOLD IT'S THE SUDAN. [LAUGHTER] HOLY (bleep). IT TURNS OUT THE HAPPIEST COUNTRY OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS THE ONE THAT NORMALLY THE MIDDLE  EAST LOOKS TO WHIT WANTS TO APPEAR STABLE. HOW CAN THEY BE DANCING IN THE STREETS OF SUDAN? IT'S HOME TO MUSLIMS IN THE NORTH FIGHTING CHRISTIANS IN THE SOUTH, PLAGUED BY FAMINE AND  FOOD SHORTAGE. IT SITS ATOP A LARGE OIL SUPPLY EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLOIT. SUED JANUARY LIKE A RANDOM CAUSE OF WAR GENERATOR. IT'S RELIGIOUS STRIFE RAPID IN FAMINE AND BURIED IN OIL. IT'S LIKE A TUR (bleep). [LAUGHTER] SO WHY ARE PEOPLE THERE DANCING IN THE STREETS?
VOTING IS UNDERWAY IN SUDAN THIS WEEK. THAT WILL LIKELY CREATE THE WORLD'S NEWEST NATION.
IN A FEW MONTHS WE MAY SEE THE CREATION OF A BRAND NEW COUNTRY. COUNTRY NUMBER 193, I BELIEVE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
YOU BET IT'S A BIG DEAL. ONLY SEVEN MORE COUNTRIES AND WE GET A FREE SANDWICH. [LAUGHTER] YES, THE CHRISTIAN SOUTHERN PART OF SUDAN HAS FINALLY DECIDED THAT ITS PRESENCE IN A COUNTRY  THAT WAS INVENTED AROUND 50 YEARS BY A BRITISH FIAT THAT COMBINES WIT A NORTHERN MUSLIM  AREA THAT HATES THEM MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST LONG-TERM INTEREST. THE VOTE HASN'T BEEN WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES SUCH AS SUDAN'S 24%  LITERACY RATE WHICH HAS LED TO CREATIVE BALLOTS.
THE BALLOTS CLEARLY LAY OUT THE CHOICE FOR THE SOUTHERN SUDANESE PEOPLE. THEY CLASPED HAND TO REMAIN UNIFIED TO THE NORTH OR AN OPEN PALM FOR INDEPENDENCE.
Jon: THAT MAKES SENSE. THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT I THOUGHT IT WAS WANT TO ARM WRESTLE AND I HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM. FLORIDA STARTING USING PICTOGRAM BALLOTS. THIS IS HOW VOTERS CHOSE TWO YEARS AGO AGAINST OBAMA AND McCAIN. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU -- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE ARABIC WRITING  ON THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM HISTORICALLY ACCURATE REALLY. [LAUGHTER] SO A TORTURED PEOPLE STEPPING OUT FROM THE SHADOW OF GENO -- GENOCIDE, PERHAPS SEEING LIGHT  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THAT COUNTRY Y. SHOULD I CARE? I'M AMERICAN. JOHN PENDERGAST COFOUNDER OF THE ENOUGH PROJECT EXPLAINS WHY I SHOULD CARE.
THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO PREVENT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BEFORE THEY  OCCUR BY SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE PLACES -- ON THE LOTIONS ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN THE  NORTH AND THE SOUTH.
Jon: I'M BEING TOLD BY MY PRODUCER THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANY  OF THAT BECAUSE OH, MY GOD THAT GUY IS STANDING NEXT TO GEORGE CLOONEY. OH, MY GOD IT'S GEORGE CLOONEY. OH, MY GOD. ACTUALLY GEORGE CLOONEY IS DOWN IN THE SUDAN HELPING TO MONITOR THE ELECTIONS. I HAVE TO GIVE HIM -- ZOOM OUT THERE, WHAT? OH, MY GOD HE'S THERE WITH CHEADLE, DAMON AND BRAD PITT. SON OF A BITCH. HE'S NOT THERE TO MONITOR THE VOTE, THIS IS A HEIST! HE'S THERE TO ROB THE SUDAN'S BIGGEST CASINO. [LAUGHTER] NOT THE SAME COMPANY AS THE ONE HERE. WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF THIS SUDAN'S INDEPENDENCE VOTE WITH AASIF MANDVI AND SAMANTHA  BEE IN SUDAN. WELCOME, GUYS. THANKS FOR JOINING US. AASIF, WHAT NOW --  [  APPLAUSE  ] -- VERY INSPIRING STORY THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH SUDAN TURNING OUT IN THE MILLIONS UNDER DPUR  HE IS TO -- DURESS TO VOTE ON WHETHER TO FORM THEIR OWN COUNTRY. AN HISTORIC DAY.
AN EXCITING TIME TO BE HERE TO WITNESS THE ATTEMPT TO UNDO  THE CONSEQUENCES OF BRITAIN'S CENTURIES LONG GAME OF RISK IN THE SUBCOULD BE NENT. THEY SAY IT LOOKS LIKE A DIAMOND. THEY HATE EACH OTHER. I SAY DIAMOND SHAPE.
Jon: THEY ARE THRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DESTINY.
THAT MUST BE NICE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SAM, I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN MONITORING THE VOTING.
YES, WELL, JON, SO FAR MORE PEACEFUL THAN EXPECTED ASIDE FROM CONTESTED BORDER AREAS  PEOPLE HAVE MADE IT TO THE POLLS TO GET THEIR HANDS ON A BALLOT JUST LIKE THIS ONE. WHAOPZ -- WHOOPS!
Jon: IS THAT YOUR HEAD SHOT?
HOW DID THAT GET IN THERE?
PROBABLY ONE FROM THE SUITCASE FULL OF HEAD SHOTS YOU MADE ME WHEEL AROUND IN CASE YOU  RUN INTO CLOONEY.
DID YOU SEE HIM?
Jon: HOW MUCH HAS INTIMIDATION AFFECTED TURNOUT?
YOU WANT A NUMBER.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU QUANTIFY.
SIX IS THE AGE OF MY DAUGHTER, EIGHT IS MY SON, THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE  BEEN MARRIED AND DIVORCED 555-3093 IS MY PHONE NUMBER. WITH ALL THE NUMBERS I GAVE YOU I'M GUESSING ZERO IS THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU ARE GOING TO CALL IT.
Jon: THIS SAY MONOLOGUE FROM ERIN BROCKOVICH.
I GUESS I WOULD MAKE A PRETTY GOOD SINGLE MOM WITH A HEART OF GOLD AND OR AMBITIOUS YOUNG  LAWYER OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS.
JON, PLEASE. CAN YOU KNOW WHICH MOVIE STAR INDIA GOT WHEN WE PARTITIONED IN 1947? ALEX GUINNESS.
Jon: OSCAR WINNER PLAYED OBI WAN. NOT TOO SHABBY.
NO THAT'S ALEC. THIS IS ALEX. (bleep) AFRICA THEY ALWAYS GET WHAT THEY WANT.
DEPENDING UPON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS.
Jon: KEEP AN EYE ON IT FOR
