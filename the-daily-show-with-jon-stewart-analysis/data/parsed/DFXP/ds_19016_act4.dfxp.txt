NOW TALKING TO THE AUTHOR OF LEAGUE DENIAL MARK FAINARU-WADA.
I WAS JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW, THE NFL WORKED SO HARD IN TERMS OF LIKE YOU CAN'T LEAD WITH YOUR HELMET, DEFENSELESS RECEIVER, LIKE SO MANY OF THE NFL'S VIOLENCE PROBLEMS, LIKE THEY ARE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT ON THE FIELD BUT OBVIOUSLY WE SEE ALL OF THE STORIES OF THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT SOME OF THIS IS DOING TO PEOPLE, AND CAUSING THESE PROBLEMS OFF FIELD.
WELL, I THINK -- NO, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT IS INTERESTING AND THIS IS THE CHALLENGE FOR THE LEAGUE IS THAT ON THE ONE HAND THEY CAN TRY TO LEGISLATE OUT THOSE HITS WE SEE WHERE A DEFENSIVE BACK CRUSHES A RUNNING BACK OR A WIDE RECEIVER BUT THEY CAN'T LEGISLATE AND A NUMBER OF THE PLAYERS WE TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK ARE AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND THE VERY NATURE OF THE SPORT IS THEM JUST POUNDING ON EACH OTHER TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE THAT OUT OF THE SPORT. MIKE WEBSTER IS SORT OF THE PATIENT ZERO, PITTSBURGH STEELERS
FOUR SUPER BOWLS THE BEDROCK OF THE TEAMS AND HE LITERALLY GOES MAD UPON RETIREMENT.
A SMART, INTELLIGENT GUY.
PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE A COACH, ANNOUNCER AND YOU SEE HIS LIFE DISINTEGRATE TO THE POINT HE IS WRITING THOUSANDS OF LETTERS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY YOU SEE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE MAN GOING MAD AND LOSING HIS MIND AND TAZING HIMSELF TO GO TO SLEEP.
Stewart: RIGHT. I THINK THEIR CONCERN MUST BE FOR PLAYER FLOW AS IT IS COMING UP THROUGH THE RANKS BECAUSE THESE PLAYERS, FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE TO DO LESS THAN THEY CAN DO. IF YOU HAVE GOT A GUY WHO IS 265 AND HE CAN RUN A 4.4, OR, AND HE IS A LINEBACKER THAT JUST MAKE THESE CRACKING HITS YOU CAN'T SAY TO HIM, HE WILL WANT TO PERFORM TO HIS HIGHEST ABILITIES AND EXPECTATIONS AND, SECOND OF ALL, ALL OF THE THINGS THEY DO THAT HAVE TOTAL DISREGARD FOR THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY AND HEALTH FOR LATER LIFE AS WELL, THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO MAKE THE CHOICE IN THE HERE AND NOW WITH VERY LITTLE CONCERN FOR THE LATER.
WELL, I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION, YOU KNOW, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH STEVE YOUNG THE FORMER 49ERS QUARTERBACK AND HE WOULD HIDE ON THE SIDE LINES TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN THE GAMES WHEN HE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY WERE GOING TO KEEP HIM OUT. THE PLAYERS WANT TO PLAY. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS A CUTTHROAT BUSINESS, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOB WITH ANY POSSIBILITY SO THEY WANT TO STAY ON THE FIELD AND THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS STEVE AND I FEEL IS THE MOST EGREGIOUS PIECE OF THE DENIAL IS THE MESSAGE IS LIKE LOOK YOU ARE OKAY, THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, JUST GO BACK ON THE FIELD AND PLAY AND YOU WILL BE FINE AND THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDIOUS ABOUT THAT SORT OF LACK OF INFORMATION.
Stewart: IN YOUR MIND, WAS IT A CONSPIRACY OF DENIAL OR WAS IT TRULY A CASE OF JUST NOT WANTING TO SEE HOW THE EVIDENCE ADDED UP AND HOW IT CAME TO PASS?  WAS IT MALICIOUS?  MALEVOLENT OR WAS IT IGNORANCE?
I MEAN I THINK IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THAT, NO PUN INTENDED, I THINK LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T GET INSIDE THE HEAD OF THESE GUYS, WE TRIED TO TALK TO THEM, WE TRIED TO GO TO NEW YORK AND TALK TO THEM BUT THEY WOULDN'T SIT DOWN WITH US.
Stewart: BUT THAT SPEAKS TO SOMETHING INSIDIOUS IN MY MIND THEY WOULD NOT AFTER ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TRY TO BE AS HONEST AND OPEN AND GET THE STORY OUT.
THE MESSAGE IS LOOK WE ARE BEING SUED BY 4,500 PLAYERS AND CAN'T TALK BUT AGAIN THE LEAGUE WOULD PICK ITS SPOT AND COME OUT AND SAY THINGS AND, YOU KNOW, WHETHER IT WAS SORT OF A CONSPIRATORIAL ELEMENT TO ALL OF THAT, I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION IF YOU LOOK AT THESE 16 PAPERS THAT THE LEAGUE PUT OUT AND IT COULD BE DRY RESEARCH, CLEARLY IF YOU READ IT BUT IT IS REALLY LIKE CLEAR, THE MESSAGE IS, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AND THESE, MANY OF THESE GUYS ARE TEAM DOCTORS AND SEEING PLAYERS REPEATEDLY SO CLEARLY, THERE IS A GROUP THINK HAPPENING, WHETHER IT IS A CONSPIRACY IN THE ACTIVE SENSE, I DON'T KNOW.
Stewart: WHERE DOES IT GO?  DOES THE LEAGUE, YOU KNOW, CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT IT PLAYS THE GAME, IN TERMS OF THE RULES OR JUST IN TERMS OF THE OPENNESS TO THE RISKS INVOLVED?
WELL, I MEAN, I THINK IT IS AGAIN LIKE WE WERE SAYING EARLIER, TWO QUESTIONS, THERE IS THE LEAGUE AND THEN THERE IS YOUTH FOOTBALL.
Stewart: RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT THE LEAGUE TO CHANGE, I REALLY LIKE THIS IS WHAT THE SPORT IS, I THINK IT IS NOW PLAYERS BEING INFORMED AND YOU CAN'T LEGISLATE OUT THESE HARD HITS AND SO I DON'T THINK THEY CHANGE IN THAT WAY, I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW DO THEY DEAL WITH THIS MESSAGE OF GETTING TO PARENTS AND YOU ARE SEEING FROM POLLS PARENTS ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND LETTING THEIR KIDS PLAY.
Stewart: AND LISTEN, SPORTS ARE NOT RISK FREE.
RIGHT.
Stewart: AND I BET IF YOU WENT AND EVEN ASKED SOME OF THESE PLAYERS, MAYBE NOT ONES SUFFERING SO DESPERATELY WOULD THEY DO IT AGAIN A MAJORITY OR EVEN A LARGE MAJORITY WOULD SAY I ABSOLUTELY, I ABSOLUTELY WOULD.
I THINK A LOT OF THEM WOULD WE'VE TALKED TO THOSE GUYS WHO SAY THAT. THERE IS NO QUESTION THEY WOULD COME BACK AND PLAY AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD -- I HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD AND, YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY THANKFULLY BUT STEVE HAS A 14-YEAR-OLD WHO MAY WANT TO PLAY NEXT YEAR AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO.
Stewart: THAT'S WHY I WALKED AWAY FROM THE GAME.
MIDDLE LINEBACKER OR --
Stewart: NO. IT IS TRUE I PLAYED A LITTLE COLLEGE BALL, SOCCER, WHICH IS LIKE FOOTBALL BUT YOU COULDN'T USE YOUR HANDS. BUT, YOU KNOW, MY KNEES ARE SHOT, MY HIPS ARE SHOT, THEY WILL GET REPLACED, BUT IF YOU CAME TO ME AND SAID, WHEN YOU ARE 50 THAT IS HOW YOU WILL FEEL, I WOULD SAY, I AM GOING TO BE 50?  THAT IS SO COOL. ALL RIGHT. LEAGUE OF DENIAL. IT IS A GREAT MYSTERY. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. [ APPLAUSE ]
