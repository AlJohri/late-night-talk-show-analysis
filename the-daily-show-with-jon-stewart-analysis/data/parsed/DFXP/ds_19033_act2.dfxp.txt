[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, WITH THE RECENT PASSING OF NELSON MANDELA CAME AN OUTPOURING OF PRAISE FROM POLITICAL LEADERS, SOME FROM THE EXPECTED QUARTERS. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY AND BRITISH PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON PAYING TRIBUTE.
HILLARY CLINTON CALLED MANDELA A CHAMPION FOR JUSTICE. HARRY REID WRITES IN A WAY MANDELA WAS BOTH THE GEORGE WASHINGTON AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN OF HIS COUNTRY.
Jon: WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM INTO A WHITE GUY SOMEHOW? IS THAT IT? HOW WOULD PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCES? HE'S LIKE GEORGE WASHINGTON, EXCEPT NOT AT ALL. THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT GOT PROPS FROM LESS EXPECTED FIGURES.
NEWT GINGRICH CALLED MANDELA ONE OF GREATEST LEADERS OF OUR LIFETIME.
Jon: TED CRUZ RELEASED A HEART FELT STATEMENT WOULD BE NEWS WHETHER MANDELA DIED OR  NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S NOT NEWS THAT PEOPLE ARE RUSHING TO PRAISE MANDELA, BUT WHAT IS NEWS IS THE REACTION TO THAT PRAISE.
YOU WROTE A FACEBOOK PAGE AND PUT OUT A STATEMENT PRAISING NELSON MANDELA A MAN YOU SUPPORTED EARLY ON AND THEN WERE SURPRISED BY SOME OF THE REACTION YOU GOT. THIS CLENCH FIST MURDERING GUERRILLA WARRIOR DOES NOT DESERVE RESPECT.
I WAS SURPRISED BY IT. CALLISTA POSTED MY STATEMENT ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE AND AMAZED AT SOME OF THE INTENSITY SOME OF WHOM CAME BACK THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE TIMES REPEATING HOW ANGRY THEY WERE.
Jon: ONE GENTLEMAN SUGGESTED THAT FOR DINNER THIS EVENING I EAT A BAG OF (bleep) AND SAID I RESEMBLED  -- QUOTE -- AN ELDERLY BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY CLAIMED I WAS A SUCKSERNUBE WHO IS GOING TO GET PWNED. I WOULD NEVER SAY THOSE THINGS IT WAS DR. AWESOMEBALL 69. WHAT ABOUT TED CRUZ.
NELSON MANDELA WILL LIVE IN HISTORY FOR DEFENDERS OF LIBERTY AROUND THE GLOBE. MORE THAN 5,000 PEOPLE LIKED IT BUT NOT ALL OF HIS FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS AGREE. HE WAS A MURDERER AND COMMUNIST WHY ARE YOU INSPIRED BY THIS. WHAT ABOUT THE RAMPANT WHITE GENOCIDE. ANOTHER WRITES STALIN, POL POT, FDR ARE ALSO DEAD. THEY DON'T DESERVE A POSITIVE EULOGY EITHER.
Jon: YOU KNOW THE GHOST OF FDR WAS LIKE HOW DID I GET DRAGGED INTO THIS? [LAUGHTER] WHAT DID I DO? [LAUGHTER] BRING ME A MARTINI IN A TEA CUP AND ONE OF MY SECOND COUSINS. [ LAUGHTER ] ANONYMOUS JERKS ON THE WEB SAY STUPID (bleep) ALL THE TIME. WHAT ABOUT NONANONYMOUS JERKS.
NELSON MANDELA STOOD UP AGAINST A GREAT INJUSTICE AND WILLING TO PAY A HUGE PRICE. THAT'S WHY HE IS MOURNED TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT STRUGGLE HE PERFORMED.
Jon: THAT'S GREAT AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.
WE HAVE A GREAT INJUSTICE WITH AN EVER INCREASING SIZE OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS TAKING OVER AND CONTROLLING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND OBAMACARE IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HOW DO I PUT THIS IN TERMS YOU HAVE GOING TO UNDERSTAND HERE. APARTHEID IS NOT OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SYSTEMIC SUBJUGATION OF A RACE OF PEOPLE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBSIDIZED HEALTH EXCHANGES. THE FACT THAT THAT INSURANCE IS NOW MANDATED GETS US NOWHERE CLOSE TO APARTHEID LEVEL INJUSTICE. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. LET THE WORLD GO FORTH TO A NEW GENERATION OF AMERICANS WHEREVER PEOPLE GATHER ON WHATEVER IT IS AMERICANS READ APARTHEID, INJUSTICEWISE GREATER THAN BY A LARGE AMOUNT OF DEGREES OBAMACARE. IF I MAY SHOUT IT FROM THE HILLTOPS. ♪  ♪ OBAMACARE IS NOT APARTHEID  [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THE ONLY INJUSTICE HERE IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A STATEMENT LIKE THAT AND STILL GET TO HAVE LTHE TV TALKIN STICK. WE'LL BEE RIGHT BACK
