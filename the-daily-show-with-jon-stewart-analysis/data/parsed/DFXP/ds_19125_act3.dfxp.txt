[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE GOT A NEW MOVIE OUT. IT'S CALLED "BEGIN AGAIN."
I JUST THINK AN A AND R MAN TELLING AN ARTIST HOW THE DRESS OR COME ACROSS IS TOTAL BULL [BLEEPED]. PEOPLE DON'T WANT THAT. THEY WANT AUTHENTICITY.
OKAY, BABE. GIVE ME THE NAME OF ONE ARTIST THAT YOU THINK PASSES YOUR AUTHENTICITY TEST.
DYLAN.
DYLAN. THAT'S THE MOST CULTIVATED ARTIST YOU COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF. HIS HAIR, HIS SUNGLASSES. HE CHANGES HIS LOOK EVERY DECADE.
RANDY NEWMAN.
LOVE RANDY NEWMAN. OK. YOU GOT ME ON THAT.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM KEIRA KNIGHTLEY. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANKS FOR COMING.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP WITH THE WORLD CUP RESULTS?
THAT WAS A CRUEL START, WASN'T IT? YOU JUST WENT STRAIGHT FOR THE JUGULAR. HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?
NO, NO, THIS WAS EMPATHY.
ARE YOU HAVING A NICE TIME, ARE WE ALL? YES?
THIS WAS EMPATHY, THIS WAS, HERE, WHAT DO YOU WANT TWO DRINKS?
THANK YOU. YEAH. IS IT VODKA? GOOD.
Jon: SEE, WE'RE ACCUSTOMED IN THIS COUNTRY TO NOT MAKING IT OUT OF THE GROUP ROUND...
YEAH.
Jon: SO FOR ENGLAND, WHAT CAN WE DO, BECAUSE WE HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, OUR COUNTRIES.
I'VE, I'VE HEARD.
Jon: I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW... YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. LET'S START AGAIN. OK, HERE WE GO.
YEAH.
Jon: I LOVE THE SPICE GIRLS. [LAUGHTER]
I LOVE HOT DOGS.
Jon: IS IT, WHEN YOU COME HERE, ARE THE CULTURES... YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND ONCE.
YEAH.
Jon: THERE IS AN ANGER UNDERLYING FOR AMERICAN PORTION SIZE THAT EVEN STRANGERS THAT I WOULD MEET, LIKE WHERE ARE YOU FROM, I WOULD SAY OH I'M FROM NEW YORK CITY, AND THE GUY WOULD BE LIKE, WHAT'S WITH THE [BLEEPED] FRENCH FRY PORTION, MY MAN.
WOW.
Jon: LIKE THEY WERE REALLY... THEY WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT WE GIVE TO PEOPLE IN RESTAURANTS.
OKAY.
Jon: DOES THAT COME UP IN CONVERSATION?
IN ENGLAND? YES, WE'RE CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT IT.
Jon: IS IT REALLY?
IT'S THE ONLY THING WE TALK ABOUT.
Jon: THAT'S SO WEIRD.
YEAH. IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE STARVING OVER THERE.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHAT'S WEIRD? THE ONLY THING WE TALK ABOUT IS AMERICA, TOO.
WELL, WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON, SO THAT'S GREAT.
Jon: WE DO HAVE THAT IN COMMON. YOU KNOW, WE'RE A VERY IMPORTANT COUNTRY.
VERY, VERY. I'VE HEARD. YES. I'VE HEARD. ALTHOUGH, CHINA'S DOING RATHER WELL, ISN'T IT.
Jon: WHO?
DON'T KNOW. DON'T WORRY.
Jon: NO, WE'RE, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, WE'RE MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT COUNTRY.
GOOD.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO SAY GOD CREATED US TO SAVE MANKIND, BUT PEOPLE DO ACTUALLY SAY THAT.
OKAY. GOOD. HOW'S THAT GOING FOR YOU?
Jon: NOT VERY WELL.
DIDN'T THINK SO.
Jon: IT GETS US INTO A [BLEEPED] LOAD OF TROUBLE.
YEAH. I HEARD, YEAH.
Jon: THIS MOVIE, YOU DISPLAY A TALENT THAT I HAD NO IDEA... YOU ARE A LOVELY SINGER.
THANK YOU.
Jon: REALLY GOOD. BUT IS THAT SOMETHING... I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU'VE DONE THAT, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU DO THAT IN A MOVIE BEFORE.
I HAD ACTUALLY DONE IT IN ONE OTHER MOVIE BUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT STYLE, BUT I, I, NO, I'VE NEVER SUNG LIKE THIS, AND I WAS JUST QUITE DISAPPOINTED I DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ADELE. YOU KNOW/
Jon: REALLY?
WELL, YEAH, YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SHOWER AND YOU'RE JUST SINGING AND YOU THINK, OH I SOUND SO GOOD RIGHT NOW. I SOUND SO GOOD. I COULD TOTALLY DO THAT ADELE THING. AND THEN YOU KINDA GET INTO A RECORDING STUDIO AS I DID AND AND GO, OH, I CAN'T, I CAN'T DO THE ADELE THING. I CAN'T.
Jon: HAVE YOU THOUGH, SOMEBODY MUST HAVE... YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN THE VOICE WAS GOOD? YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN...
NO, WE, WE, I WASN'T GIVEN THE SONGS UNTIL TWO DAYS BEFORE I HAD TO GO INTO THE STUDIO. REALLY. AND I'M NOT A SINGER. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. SO WE JUST KIND JUST GOT IN THERE AND JUST SORT OF WENT, OKAY, WE HAVE FOUR DAYS, THIS HAS TO WORK.
Jon: THAT'S SORT OF REMARKABLE BECAUSE WHEN YOU AUDITIONED TO NOT HAVE... THAT'S A BIG GAMBLE THEY TOOK. YOU COULD HAVE WALKED IN THERE, THEY'D HANDED YOU THE SONGS AND YOU DID ONE OF THESE LIKE... ♪ I LOVE A PARADE ♪ [SINGING OFF KEY] LIKE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE.
YEAH. YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT. AGAIN, NEXT TIME MAYBE I'LL DO THAT.
Jon: OH JESUS.
THAT COULD BE GREAT, AS WELL.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT'S WONDERFUL ABOUT OUR INTERVIEW?
YEAH.
Jon: IS IT IS REFLECTIVE I THINK OF THE ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES.
REALLY? THIS IS WORRYING, ISN'T IT? YEAH?
Jon: NO, NO, NO, IT'S I'M  AN IGNORANT ASSHOLE AND YOU ARE VERY KINDLY PUTTING UP WITH ME. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] BETWEEN OUR NATIONS. THAT'S HOW IT FEELS.
WE'VE GOT IT RIGHT HERE.
Jon: WE'VE GOT IT. THIS IS IT. WE ARE THE U.N.
I'M BULL [BLEEP] WITH A SMILE AND SO ARE YOU. SO IT'S ALL FINE.
Jon: NO, WHAT, WHAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS SINGING NOW, IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WILL PURSUE? LIKE...
NO. NO.
Jon: OH. BECAUSE YOU COULD.
COULD I? I THINK NOT. NOW YOU'RE THE ONE DOING THE BULL [BLEEPED].
Jon: NOT SO. DID THEY...
REALLY? AREN'T YOU? REALLY? I MEAN, THE DIPLOMACY IS GOING AMAZINGLY WELL.
Jon: IT IS GOING AMAZINGLY WELL. DID THEY... MAYBE I DON'T KNOW THIS, DID THEY MANIPULATE THE SOUND OF IT? OR IS THAT WHY IT SOUNDS LIKE IT SOUNDS?
NO, NO, I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE.
Jon: SO IT'S YOUR VOICE?
WELL, THEY TOLD ME IT'S MY VOICE.
Jon: IT'S VERY GOOD. I THINK YOU SHOULD, IF I HAD THAT ABILITY, I WOULD NOT BE HERE. [LAUGHTER]
WHERE WOULD YOU BE?
Jon: I'D BE WEARING A WHITE FLOWERY DRESS...
YES, EXACTLY. SITTING RIGHT HERE.
Jon: I'D BE THERE AND YOU'D BE HERE WEARING A SUIT.
OK, FINE. GOOD.
Jon: YOU'D BE AN OLD JEW AND I'D BE A WONDERFUL PERFORMER. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE MOVIE.
