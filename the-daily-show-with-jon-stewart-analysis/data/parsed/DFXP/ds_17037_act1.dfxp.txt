JANUARY 1, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  .
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART! YES, WE'RE BACK, BABY, SO NICE TO SEE YOU. I HOPE YOU HAD A NICE NEW YEAR'S. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE NO LONGER ROUND MOUND OF REBOUND, SIR CHARLES BARKLEY. I SAW HIM BACKSTAGE, HE LOOKS UNBELIEVABLE. (APPLAUSE) HE LOOKS UNBELIEVABLE. I WANT TO START BY SAYING CHARLES BARKLEY'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION SHOULD BE TO LET  HIMSELF GO BECAUSE HE LOOKS TREMENDOUS. OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THAT TONIGHT YOU'RE EXCITED TO HEAR THE RESULTS OF TODAY'S IOWA CAUCUS. I DO NOT KNOW THEM. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE I AM BROADCASTING TO YOU FROM THE PAST. (LAUGHTER) IN MY WORLD, IT IS 6:00 P.M., JANUARY 3. BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT I DO KNOW. THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND THE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS' DESPERATE EFFORT TO EXPLORE  EVERY OTHER POSSIBLE OPTION-- LIVING OR OTHERWISE-- BEFORE ULTIMATELY AND UNHAPPILY VOTING  FOR MITT ROMNEY. (LAUGHTER) THE RITE OF PASSAGE FOR REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOWN AS ROMSPRINGA. (LAUGHTER) YES, REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO END UP WITH ROMNEY MUCH IN THE WAY A  16-YEAR-OLD AMISH BOY KNOWS HIS SIX MONTHS WITH AN IPOD WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE WAY TO SEVERAL  DECADES OF HAND-TOOLED BARN BUILDING. (LAUGHTER) NOW, WHEN OUR SHOW LEFT IN DECEMBER. NEWT GINGRICH WAS REPUBLICANS' TEMPORARY VICE. WHICH ENDED MUCH IN THE WAY THE YOUNG AMISH'S FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH ALCOHOL ENDS-- NAUSEA, VOMITING AND A VOW TO THE LORD NEVER TO GO NEAR THAT (BLEEP) AGAIN. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) WHICH BRING US TO RON PAUL. RON PAUL. COULD HE-- THE PRODRUG LEGALIZATION ANTIWAR OBSTETRICIAN BE THE BRIEF  REPUBLICAN FLIRTATION THAT COULD LEAD THE FLOCK ASTRAY?
RON PAUL HAS DISAVOWED NEWSLETTERS WITH HIS NAME ON THEM. NEWSLETTERS FROM THE 1980s AND '90s WITH RACIAL INSULTS TOWARD AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHERS.
Jon: OKAY, PROBABLY NOT. THE NEWSLETTER! DID YOU PEOPLE KNOW THAT BEFORE YOU COULD WRITE CRAZY (BLEEP) ON TUMBLER AND WORD PRESS PEOPLE  HAD TO TYPE THEIR CRAZY (BLEEP) UP AND PRINT IT OUT ON WHAT WAS CALLED PAPER. (LAUGHTER) AND DISTRIBUTED BY HAND REACHING ONLY TO A FEW PARANOID SPIR  CYSTS WHO LIVED WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF YOUR... I GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL LAIR. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, SO THE FUSE LETTER IS NOT GOOD. I WOULD PREFER RON PAUL DO A BETTER JOB OF OWNING THIS TERRIBLE MISTAKE WITH THESE NEWSLETTERS. HERE'S WHY THE DOCTOR STILL HAS FANS: HIS OPPONENTS, HOW WILL THEY ATTACK PAUL OVER THESE NEWSLETTERS?
I TOOK IT TO RON PAUL OVER THE ISSUE OF A NUCLEAR IRAN.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR A CANDIDATE WHO WOULD ALLOW IRAN  TO BE ARMED AND TO WIPE OUT ISRAEL.
ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT THINKS IT'S OKAY FOR IRAN TO HAVE A  NUCLEAR WEAPON. I DON'T.
Jon: THEIR MAIN PROBLEM WITH RON PAUL ISN'T THE RACIST  CONSPIRACY MONGERING NEWSLETTER, IT'S BECAUSE HE WON'T PRE-AGREE TO START A WAR WITH IRAN. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S LIKE HATING THE T.V. SHOW "WORK IT" BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A  HALF HOUR LONG. (LAUGHTER) BUT THAT'S IT! ROMSPRINGA'S OVER. YOU WENT THROUGH EVERYBODY. YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO ROMNEY. THERE'S NOBODY ELSE. UNLESS... OH, LORD, PLEASE, NO.
SANTORUM HAS CAUGHT FIRE. HIS EVENTS NOW OVERFLOWING WITH SUPPORTERS.
HE'S HAD A METEORIC RISE.
A SANTORUM SURGE.
SANTORUM WAS CONSIDERED THE LONGEST OF LONG SHOTS. HE NOW HAS A CHANCE OF WINNING THE IOWA CAUCUSES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GET THE (BLEEP) OUT OF HERE! (LAUGHTER) SANTORUM. REALLY? REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TRY EVERY CHOCOLATE IN THE BOX? LOOK, LOOK, HERE'S YOUR CANDIDATES, LET'S CALL IT A WHITEMAN'S SAMPLER. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU GOT THEM ALL IN THERE? YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THE PLAIN CHOCOLATE. YOU'RE GONNA. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA END UP. YOU JUST ARE. YOU TRIED TO BACHMANN OVER HERE, TOO MANY NUTS. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. NO GOOD. PERRY. OH, THE PERRY LOOKS GREAT. OH, LOOK AT THAT. CAN YOU GET THE PERRY OVER HERE? OH, LOOK AT THE PERRY. THAT LOOKS GREAT. BUT GUESS WHAT? ALMOND NOUGAT. WHO PUTS ALMOND NOUGAT IN CHOCOLATE? YOU TRIED ALL OF THEM. ALL OF THEM EXCEPT THIS ONE. THIS IS THE ONE YOU NEVER TRIED BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT SUCKS. THIS ONE? THAT'S SANTORUM. (LAUGHTER) IT'S THE ONE THAT HAS THE CHERRY (BLEEP) ON THE INSIDE. THE ONE YOU TRY AND PAWN OFF ON ONE OF YOUR COUSINS. LOOK AT THIS, LOOK. LOOK AT THIS. SEE IT? LOOK AT THIS (BLEEP) OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! MY CHOCOLATE WAS ALIVE AND NOW IT'S BLEEDING! SO THIS IS THE ONE YOU'RE GETTING. YOU'RE GETTING ROMNEY IN THE END. THE LITTLE MESSENGER BOY. THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE. LOOK AT THAT. HE'S GOT SOME SANTORUM ON HIM. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO CLEAN UP WHEN YOU'VE GOT  SANTORUM ON YOU. (LAUGHTER) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DO NOT GOOGLE THAT. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S IT. YOU END UP WITH ROMNEY, THE LEAST BAD CHOCOLATE. AND, BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU DO ULTIMATELY END UP WITH ROMNEY, DON'T TRY AND PRETEND THIS IS THE CHOCOLATE YOU WANTED THE WHOLE TIME. YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISERABLE, NOT BECAUSE ROMNEY FLIP-FLOPS OR PRETENDS HE'S AN ORDINARY FELLOW TRYING TO MAKE IN THE THIS  BLUE-COLLAR WORLD, BUT BECAUSE ROMNEY'S GOOD IDEAS REEK OF JOHN KERRYESQUE OUT OF TOUCHEDNESS. DID YOU WATCH THE COVERAGE OF TIMES SQUARE IN NEW YEAR'S EVE? DID YOU SEE MITT ROMNEY BOUGHT THE SPACE BEHIND THE BALL IN TIMES SQUARE. THAT'S SMART. MAKES PERFECT BUSINESS SENSE. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOUR BUSINESS IS GETTING PEOPLE LIKE YOU. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE THOSE ADS RIGHT ABOVE URINALS. YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS "THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, PEOPLE CAN'T GO  ANYWHERE, THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT." THEN YOUR SECOND THOUGHT IS "I  HATE WHOEVER THE (BLEEP) PUT THIS HERE." (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S YOUR GUY. EAT UP. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AN
