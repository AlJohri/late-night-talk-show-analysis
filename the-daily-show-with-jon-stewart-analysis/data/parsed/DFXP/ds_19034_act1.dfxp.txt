FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR GUEST TONIGHT AMY ADAMS FROM THE MOVIE "AMERICAN HUSTLE" BUT WHAT BE THIS DEVIL'S STICK? [LAUGHTER] WHAT SORT OF WITCHCRAFT? [LAUGHTER] QUESTION FOR THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT THING? THAT THING IN YOUR HAND THERE? WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT? WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM THERE ARE MANY REASONS THAT THIS NATION IS GREAT STARIEST STRIPEIEST FLAG, THE MOST LOCO TACOS AND THE BEST OPRAH ON EARTH. SERIOUSLY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CANADA'S OPRAH, SHE AIN'T (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ]   CANADA'S OPRAH DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A SHOW. SHE'S JUST SOME LADY WHO LIVES IN CANADA AND IS NAMED OPRAH AND LOOKS IDENTICAL TO OUR OPRAH. WHAT A SURPRISE. [ LAUGHTER ] RECENTLY AMERICA'S GREATNESS HAS COME INTO QUESTION.
U.S. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GETTING A BAD GRADE FROM A NEW REPORT THAT MEASURES PROFICIENCY IN READING MATH AND SCIENCE AMONG 65 COUNTRIES. THE U.S. WAS 36th BEHIND THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC.
Jon: OH! I ALWAYS FEEL BAD FOR WHATEVER COUNTRY IS JUST ABOVE AMERICA ON THESE LISTS. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE INVARIABLY THAT COUNTRY IS USED AS A STANDARD FOR JUST HOW FAR WE HAVE FALLEN AS A PEOPLE. 36, BENEATH THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC. I MEAN, THOSE (bleep) PEOPLE EAT THEIR OWN VOMIT. [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY SURE THEIR PRESIDENT IS A COW. [ LAUGHTER ] THE MAIN EXPORT IS FARTS. [ LAUGHTER ] FARTS -- [LAUGHTER] -- THAT THEY EXPORT IN CRATES WHICH IS I THINK THE WORST WAY TO EXPORT FARTS, I WOULD THINK. YOU WOULD WANT SOMETHING MORE, MORE AIR-TIGHT. A CRATE YOU PACK THE FARTS, YOU DO YOUR  JOB BY THE TIME IT GETS TO WHERE IT'S GOING IT'S -- [LAUGHTER] -- JUST A BOX OF AIR. [ LAUGHTER ] SO HOW BAD ARE WE DOING?
IT'S RANKING HAS DROPPED IN ALL THREE SUBJECTS NOW PLACING 26th IN MATH, 21ST IN SCIENCE AND 17th IN READING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OH, MY GOD WE'RE IN TWENTY-FIRTH PLACE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THAT THERE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A, THEY STOLE THE TITLE OF MY SELF PUBLISHED COLIN FIRTH CLONING FAN FICTION. [LAUGHTER] AND B, THAT IS THE BEST UNINTENTIONAL ILLUSTRATION OF OUR COUNTRY'S EDUCATIONAL PLIGHT. BUT THOSE STATISTICS ONLY PORTEND OUR DYSTOPIC FUTURE. ANYTHING ON THE DYSTOPIC PRESENT?
SO FAR IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT ONLY 55 BILLS SIGNED INTO LAW THIS YEAR. THAT MAKES THIS THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS EVER.
ONE OF LEAST PRODUCTIVE ON RECORD.
THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. THAT INCLUDES THE FAMED ABSINTHE CONGRESS OF 1872 WHEN EVERYBODY JUST ROLLED AROUND ON THE FLOOR GOING WHY ARE THERE LIZARDS EVERYWHERE? [LAUGHTER] NEXT YEAR WE GO BACK TO  EGG NOG. THERE HAS TO BE PRESSING ISSUES CONGRESS SHOULD STILL ADDRESS. AND WHILE YOU ANSWER THAT, I'LL ENJOY A GLASS OF MILK.
CONFIRMING A FED CHAIR.
LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
AMERICAN FAMILIES COULD SEE MILK PRICES SPIKE TO $7 A GALLON IF CONGRESS CAN'T PASS A FARM BILL BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
Jon: OH, NO. MY PRECIOUS WHITE GOLD. NOOO! OOH, AHH. SAVE YOU FOR A RAINY DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THE BEST PART OF THIS BIT IS -- I DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN UP AFTER THE SHOW. IT'S TERRIBLE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S MAGIC. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU MIGHT WONDER WHICH POLITICAL PARTY BEARS MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOTHING GETTING DONE. OBVIOUSLY EACH SIDE IS BLAMING THE OTHER. BUT HERE'S A TIP. THE PARTY MORE RESPONSIBLE MIGHT BE THE ONE THAT DEFINED ITS MISSION THUSLY.
WE SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED ON HOW MANY NEW LAWS WE CREATE. WE OUGHT TO BE JUDGED ON HOW MANY LAWS WE REPEAL.
ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR YOU, ASK WHAT YOU CAN STOP YOUR COUNTRY FROM DOING! [LAUGHTER] BUT ALL RIGHT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW DID THIS LEGISLATIVE CLUSTER (bleep) HAPPEN? WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THE WORST CONGRESS OF ALL TIME? WE SENT JASON JONES TO FIND OUT.
THE GRIDLOCK IN CONGRESS EXISTS LARGELY BECAUSE OF ONE THING. GERRYMANDERING HAS BECOME A MASSIVE PROBLEM.
CONGRESS DOESN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE AMERICA.
YES GERRYMANDERING, THE REDRAWING OF CONGRESSIONAL SEATS TO GIVE A POLITICAL ADVANTAGE TO ONE PARTY HAS MADE MOST DISTRICTS SO SECURE THAT ONLY 35 TRUE SWING DISTRICTS REMAIN. YET THE GERRYMANDERERS WHO DRAW THE LINES THINK THEIR WORK IS DEEPLY MISUNDERSTOOD.
PEOPLE MIGHT CRITICIZE WHAT I DO BUT IN ORDER TO BE AN ARTIST YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT YOU ARE USING, THE MEDIUM YOU ARE USING.
EXACTLY. WHOA, DID THAT GUY JUST CALL HIMSELF AN ARTIST?
IT'S NOT JUST LINES. THERE'S A STORY BEHIND EACH LINE.
THAT'S MIND BLOWING, MAN. SO YOU ARE JUST A NATURAL BORN ARTIST?
IT'S -- IT JUST -- WHEN YOU STUDY DATA.
YEAH.
YOU END UP SEEING DATA.
HIS ARTWORKS ARE ON DISPLAY IN DOZENS OF STATES BUT SADLY CRITICS LIKE MELANIE SLOANE LONG FOR A DAY WHEN PEOPLE VOTE IN BORING EQUALLY BASED POPULATION SQUARES.
THEY ARE NOT ARTISTS. THEY ARE A CANCER ON GOVERNMENT. THEIR WHOLE AIM IS TO UNDERMINE THE DEMOCRACY.
PEOPLE SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT PICASSO.
I REALLY DOUBT THAT THEY DID.
LIKE PICASSO HE HAS WEALTHY POLITCALLY CONNECTED PATRONS. THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIS WORK.
TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS. CR
WE'RE CREATING THE WHOLE MELIEU OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR REDISTRICTING.
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A LOT OF BROWN, A LOT OF HISPANIC POPULATION.
YES, THE HISPANIC POPULATION HAS ITS OWN FACTORS. DIFFERENT SHADES, MEXICAN, PUERTO RICAN, CUBAN.
HOW WOULD YOU MIX A TOASTED SESAME CUBAN IN WITH A DARKER CHOCOLATE DOMINICAN?
THAT'S THE ART OF REDISTRICTING, COMING UP WITH THAT MIX OF LINES.
PEOPLE MUST GO CRAZY FOR THIS WORK.
UM, I DON'T KNOW IF GO CRAZY IF THE RIGHT TERM.
WELL, THEY CERTAINLY GO CRAZY AT IT. AND THEY CERTAINLY DID FOR ILLINOIS'S FOURTH CONSIDERED THE MOST GERRYMANDERED DISTRICT IN AMERICA.
THIS IS MARRYING THE PUERTO RICAN PART OF CHICAGO WITH THE MEXICAN AND SOUTHERN PART OF THE CHICAGO. THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE A WHOLE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN THE MIDDLE. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND AROUND IT.
TO MELANIE THIS IS AN ABOMINATION. WHILE I SEE SOME OF THE DISTRICTS MAY BE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THEY ARE OFTEN LINES THAT DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
DOESN'T ALL GOOD ART EFFECT CHANGE?
I SUPPOSE GOOD ART CAN EFFECT CHANGE.
IS ART PROVOCATIVE? WHAT AREN'T YOU GETTING MAN?
I DON'T AGREE IT'S ART.
WHAT IS ART TO YOU?
ART IS -- WHAT IS ART? HMMMM, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. ART IS AH --
YOU CALL YOURSELF A CRITIC. WITH SUCH CRITICISM OF GERRY MANDERING GROWING THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO GET THE RESPECT FOR THE ARTISTS THEY SO RICHLY DESERVE WITH A NONPARTISAN SHOWING. ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? ART LOVERS MARVELED AT VIRGINIA'S THIRD.
I SEE ANGER.
PENNSYLVANIA'S SIXTH.
LOOKING LIKE ME.
AND MARYLAND'S THIRD.
IT'S A LARGER FIGURED PERSON THAT IS TO BE DOMINATING THE SMALLER FIGURE ON THE RIGHT.
WOW THAT'S -- YOU ARE OVERTHINKING IT NOW.
IT WAS A GRAND DISPLAY OF THE OPTICAL ILLUSION OF FAIRNESS. YOU TWO MUST LOVE WHAT HE HAS DONE WITH BROWN. WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THOSE IN POWER CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE ARTS AND VISIONARIES LIKE HIM.
ART IS IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER.
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL STOP WHEN THE COUNTRY IS RUINED?
NO, PROBABLY NOT.
KEEP DRIVING IT INTO THE GROUND?
NO, THE COUNTRY IS VERY RESILIENT.
VERY NICE. JASON JONES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
