( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  AS YOU KNOW, THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SPENT THE  LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS CROTCH DEEP IN THE SCANDAL SWAMP, AS MY  GRANDPAPPY USED TO SAY. WHILE WE'VE HAD OUR FUN, I'VE  NOTICED A FEW FOLKS AT THE PARTY  WHO I'M NOT SURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVITED WHICH BRINGS US TO  OUR RECURRING SEGMENT, "LET'S  ALL PILE ON THE PRESIDENT-- NOT SO FAST YOU."  ONE CRITIC OF THE PRESIDENT IN  PARTICULAR HAS BEEN DEEPLY PAIND  BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S  MISDEEDS.
ALL THREE OF THESE SCANDALS  MAKE A CLUSTER THAT IMPLIES SOME  VERY BAD THINGS. THIS IS SO BROAD, THIS I.R.S. THING. IT'S SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN  IN MY LIFETIME. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  HELLO, NOONAN. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  LOOK AT PEGGY NOONAN. PEGGY NOONAN, SHE'S MORE UPSET  THAN YOUR MOM WHEN SHE CAUGHT  YOU JERKING OFF WITH ONE HAND AND SMOKING A JOINT WITH THE  OTHER HAND. ( LAUGHTER )  YOUR MASTURBATING IS JUST SO... DISAPPOINTING. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW THINK HARD, PEGGY NOONAN. NEVER IN YOUR LIFETIME HAVE YOU  SEEN A SCANDAL THIS BAD? WHAT IF A PRESIDENT SECRETLY  SOLD WEAPONS TO IRAN IN RETURN  FOR AMERICAN HOSTAGES AND THEN USED THE PROCEEDS TO ILLEGALLY  FUND A BUN OF COKED UP, RIGHT  QING JUNGLE RAPISTS IN  NICARAGUA? RING A BELL? HERE'S A HINTUE WORKED IN HIS  WHITE HOUSE AS A HIGH-PROFILE  SPEECHWRITER. I MEAN, WHAT WAS THE IRAN-CONTRA   IRAN-CONTRA--  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  WHAT WAS THE IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL  SCANDAL-- WHAT WAS THE  IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL IT NOT A  SCANDAL.
HECK, RONALD REAGAN WANTED TO  HELP THOSE HOSTAGES, BUT IT SPUN  OUT OF CONTROL AND REAGAN BY THE END WAS SURPRISED AT SOME OF THE  THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED. HE HAD BAD LUCK IN IRAN-CONTRA. THE IRAN-CONTRA WAS UNLUCKY.
Jon:  REAGAN WAS JUST IN  THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG  TIME-- SPECIFICALLY, THE WHITE HOUSE DURING HIS OWN  ADMINISTRATION. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  THIS IRAN-CONTRA WASN'T A-- IT  WASN'T A SCANDAL.
IT WAS A MISTAKE. IT WAS NOT A DISASTER, BUT IT  WAS A MISTAKE.
Jon:  MISTAKE, LIKE  WRITING THE WRONG DATE ON A  CHECK OR WRITING THE WRONG ADDRESS ON A BOX MARKED  "WEAPONS."  ( LAUGHTER )  SO HOW ABOUT OBAMA? IS HE OFF THE HOOK THEN FOR HIS  MISTAKE?
ULTIMATELY, THESE ARE  EXECUTIVE AGENCIES WHICH ARE  PROVING SO DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC. IS HE PRESIDENT OR NOT?
Jon:  IT DOESN'T MATTER  IF OBAMA KNEW WITH THE  WRONGDOING OR IF IT WAS THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM. HE IS THE PRESIDENT. THE BUCK STOPS WITH HIM. WHAT ABOUT REAGAN, AS SHE WROTE  IN, "WHEN CHARACTER WAS KING,"  THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM SIMPLY FAILED AND HURT THEIR PRESIDENT. THE ONLY THING HE WAS GUILTY OF  WAS TRUSTING TOO MUCH. ( LAUGHTER )  AND SELLING EMBARGOED ARMS TO  IRAN FOR THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES  AND FUNNELING THE MONEY TO COKED OUT JUNGLE RAPISTS IN NICARAGUA? WHY IS IT SO DIFFERENT FOR  REAGAN? WHAT MAKES HIM SO SPECIAL?
IMAGINE A MAN NOBODY HATES. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  A MAN NOBODY HATES. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  OH, YOU MEANT-- OH,  YOU MEANT REAGAN, OKAY. ARE YOU SURE?
REAGAN, WHOM I ADORED. HE WAS TO POPULAR POLITICS WHAT  HENRY JAMES WAS TO AMERICAN  LITERATURE. HE WAS THE MASTER. HE WAS PROBABLY THE SWEETEST,  MOST INNOCENT MAN EVER TO SERVE  IN THE OVAL OFFICE. HE WAS NEVER DARK, NEVER MEAN,  THIS SUNNY MAN TOUCHED SO MANY  AMERICANS. EGO TIES US ALL IN KNOTS, BUT  NOT HIM. NO, GREAT MEN ARE GOOD MEN SAID  LORD ACTON, WHO WAS RIGHT UNTIL  REAGAN. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  HERE'S THE DEAL YOU  CAN'T GET SO UPSET ABOUT OBAMA  IF YOU HAVE WRITTEN THE BOOK "50 SHADES OF GRAGGAN."  WE'LL BE RIGHT
