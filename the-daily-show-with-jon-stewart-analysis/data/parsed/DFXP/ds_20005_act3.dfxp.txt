(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST BEST SELLING AUTHOR AND A SURGEON AND A PROFESSOR AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED, "BEING MORTAL, MEDICINE AND WHAT MATTERS IN THE END." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, ATUL GAWANDE. (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) HELLO, SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS, BEING MORTAL, IT IS A REALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE KIND OF DISCUSSION THAT WE DO NOT HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS A REASONED DISCUSSION ABOUT THE END OF LIFE. AND WHAT MATTERS TO PEOPLE. IN THIS COUNTRY, ALL THE PANIC OF DEATH PANELS AND ALL THESE THINGS. HOW SHOULD WE START THIS CONVERSATION?
SO, I STARTED ASKING THAT, 17% OF OUR COUNTRY AT THE END OF THE '90s DIED AT HOME. AND THE REST WERE IN INSTITUTIONS. AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY MOST PEOPLE WANT TO GO. AND SO WHAT I WAS WONDERING ABOUT WERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAD IT GO BETTER THAN YOU EXPECT, AND AT THE CENTER OF IT WERE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT, YOU KNOW, SIMPLE THINGS. WE DON'T ASK WHAT THE PRIORITIES PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR LIFE, BESIDES JUST LIVING LONGER. WHAT ARE THE TRADE-OFFS YOU'RE WILLING TO MAKE, AND NOT WILLING TO MAKE. WHAT ARE FEARS AND GOALS YOU MIGHT HAVE. WHAT WORRIES DO YOU HAVE FOR THE FUTURE. AND IF WE ASK THAT, AS DOCTORS, YOU START GETTING SOME REAL GUIDEPOSTS TO WHAT PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE IN THEIR LIVES. EVEN WHEN IT'S SHORT.
Jon: BECAUSE THERE IS -- THERE'S A SENSE IN AMERICA THAT NO MATTER WHAT, I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS, I DON'T CARE WHAT CONDITION I'M IN, YOU DO WHAT YOU CAN, CUT OFF MY HEAD, PUT IT IN A JAR, HOOK IT UP TO A BATTERY, WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, YOU MUST DO THIS. AND THAT'S NOT AS YOU START TO SEE, YOU KNOW, AND GOING THROUGH THIS WITH PARENTS THAT ARE GETTING OLDER, YOU START TO REALIZE, WELL, MAYBE THIS ISN'T ABOUT JUST DO WHATEVER YOU CAN.
I MEAN I WROTE THE BOOK IN PART BECAUSE I'M A CANCER SURGEON. AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HANDLED THESE VERY WELL. AND THEN MY DAD GOT A TUMOR IN HIS BRAIN STEM AND HIS SPINAL CHORD. AND WE DIDN'T WANT THAT PATHWAY TO THE END. WE WANTED HIM TO GET ALL THE SURGERY, ALL THE RADIATION, ALL THE CHEMOTHERAPY, BUT NOT AT THE COST OF WHAT HE THOUGHT A LIFE WAS WORTH LIVING FOR. HE WANTED TO STILL BE WHO HE WAS. AND WE HAD THESE HARD CONVERSATIONS THAT I LEARNED FROM WATCHING HOW PEOPLE HANDLE THESE BETTER THAN I DID AND THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS WERE JUST A FEW BASIC QUESTIONS. I WOULD ASK MY DAD. SO WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR CONDITION NOW? HOW IS IT GOING? AND HE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT GOING THAT WELL. I'M CONCERNED. I'M LOSING MY ABILITY TO WALK NOW.
Jon RIGHT.
WE WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOUR, WHAT ARE YOUR FEARS AND GOALS?
AND HE WOULD SAY WELL, AS LONG AS I CAN ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, AS LONG AS I CAN STILL CONTRIBUTE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS STILL WANTING TO DO CHARITY WORK AND WORK FOR ROTARY FOUNDATION WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM IN HIS LAST FEW MONTHS OF LIFE. HE STILL DID IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WE CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE ALONG THE WAY. WE DID SURGERY BECAUSE IT LET HIM DO THOSE THINGS MORE. WE DID RADIATION, BUT WHEN THE CHEMOTHERAPY TOOK IT AWAY, THAT'S WHEN WE STOPPED IT.
Jon: RIGHT. AND THESE, SOME OF THESE AGGRESSIVE TREATMENTS, PEOPLE MAYBE DON'T REALIZE THE EFFECT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE ON THEIR SIMPLE QUALITY OF LIFE. AND THE AMAZING THING TO ME IS, THESE MORE PALLIATIVE OR HOSPICE TYPE REMEDIES, PEOPLE TENDED TO LIVE LONGER.
YEAH, THERE'S AN AMAZING SERIES OF STUDIES NOW THAT HAVE SHOWN, ONE EXAMPLE, AT THE MASS GENERAL HOSPITAL IN BOSTON, THEY RANDOMIZED HALF OF THE PATIENTS WHO HAD LUNG CANCER, STAGE 4, LIVED ONLY 11 MONTHS ON AVERAGE, TO GETTING USUAL ONCOLOGY CARE VERSUS USUAL ONCOLOGY CARE PLUS SEEING A PALLIATIVE CARE SPECIALIST WHO HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT WHO THEIR GOALS MIGHT FEBRUARY THEIR HEALTH WAS THERE SO ONES HAD THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT THEIR GOALS MIGHT BE IF THEIR HEALTH WORSENED.
THE ONES WHO HAD THE CONVERSATIONS ENDED UP HAVING, THEY HAD CHOSE FEWER DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL, THEY STOPPED CHEMOTHERAPY SOONER. THEY WENT ON HOSPICE EARLIER. THEY HAD LESS SUFFERING AT THE END OF LIFE AND THEY LIVED 25% LONGER. THAT JUST MEANS WE'RE MAKING BAD DECISIONS ALONG THE WAY, OUT OF OUR ANXIETY ABOUT HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS.
IS THERE ANYTHING MORE NEFARIOUS OTHER THAN ANXIETY? IS THERE SORT OF A PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIAL MEDICAL COMPLEX THAT IS SO STEEPED IN PROCEDURES, AND THE FINANCE THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO BREAK THROUGH THAT AS WELL?
YEAH. EVERY PUSH IN OUR SYSTEM IS TOWARDS DO SOMETHING MORE. YOU KNOW, I GET PAID MORE TO DO THE OPERATION BY FAR THAN I WILL EVER GET PAID TO NOT DO THE OPERATION. IN FACT, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE...
Jon: RIGHT.
TO TAKE THE TIME FOR THESE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW, ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE FAMILIES AND THE PATIENTS, THEY CAN FIND IT HARD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AS WELL AS THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, LET'S, LET'S GO FOR THE LOTTERY TICKET BUT ALSO PLAN FOR WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LOTTERY TICKET DOESN'T COME THROUGH.
AND I THINK THE GOOD NEWS FOR SOME OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF EBOLA, WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE SOON ANYWAY. (LAUGHTER)  SO IN MANY WAYS, WHILE THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HEARTFELT AND WELL REASONED BOOK, TWO WEEKS FROM NOW... (LAUGHTER) ARE WE ALL GOING TO DIE, BY THE WAY? BECAUSE YOU ARE A SURGEON. YOU UNDERSTAND, YOU HAVE WRITTEN ARTICLES ABOUT EBOLA. ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE THINGS. ARE WE ALL GOING TO DIE IMMEDIATELY OR DO WE HAVE LIKE A MONTH.
WE ARE NOT IN DANGER OF THIS BEING AN EPIDEMIC SPREADING THROUGH OUR POPULATION HERE.
Jon: DO YOU WATCH THE NEWS? SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT. YOU'RE COMING FROM A REASONED MEDICAL PROFESSION TAKE, THEY'RE NOT GOING WITH THAT. ARE WE WELL SET UP TO HANDLE THESE TYPES OF THINGS?
SO ON ONE LEVEL, LOOK, WE HAVE SOME BASIC INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES THAT WE'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH AT IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE HAVE 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO PICK UP INFECTIONS IN OUR HOSPITALS. AND THERE ARE, AND YOU KNOW, MY LAST BOOK, "THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO" WAS ABOUT THE IDEA WE AREN'T EVEN FOLLOWING THE CHECKLISTS...
Jon: YES. YES.
ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT BY MAKING IT, WELL, SO THE RED LIGHT HAS TURNED ON, AND SUDDENLY HOSPITALS ARE LEARNING OH MY GOD, WE BETTER BE WASHING OUR HANDS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WE BETTER PUT ON THE GOWNS PROPERLY AND WE BETTER TAKE THEM OFF PROPERLY. AND THAT'S PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD THING FOR US.  IT'S AMAZING.
Jon: BEFORE EBOLA SURGEONS COME IN THERE WERE LIKE GRASS STAINS AND LIKE RIB JUICE.
YEAH.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON. BUT HERE'S-- I LOVE YOUR APPROACH ABOUT IT, AND "CHECKLIST MANIFESTO" WAS THE SAME WAY. IT JUST, IT IS DISPASSIONATE BUT COMPASSIONATE IF THAT MAKES SENSE. IT'S VERY REASONED BUT WITH COMPASSIONATE ITS CORE. AND IT STRIKES ME AS THE WAY FORWARD FOR ALL OF THIS.
WELL, I LIKE BEING HERE WHEN YOU SAY THAT.
Jon: WELL, THERE THEN, YOU ARE. AND THAT'S HOW IT GOES. BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLE. AND I HOPE AS IT WAS WITH CHECKLIST THAT IT BEGINS A CONVERSATION THAT IS SO NECESSARY. I MEAN WE'RE ALL, OUR POPULATION IS GETTING SO MUCH OLDER NOW. AND IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER FOR THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF CARE.
FOR ALL OF US.
Jon: FOR ALL OF US WOULD BE GREAT. "BEING MORTAL," IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. IT'S REALLY TERRIFIC. ATUL GAWANDE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING BY.
