SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE YESTERDAY. CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE WASSERMAN-SHULTZ CAUSED A BIT OF AN UPROAR WHEN SHE LAID INTO A  FLORIDA REPUBLICAN, HIS SUPPORT OF THE CUT, CAP, BALANCE BILL.
INCREDIBLY, THE GENTLEMAN FROM FLORIDA, WHO REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF MEDICARE  BENEFICIARY, AS DO I, IS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PLAN TO INCREASE COSTS FOR MEDICARE  BENEFICIARIES, UNBELIEVABLE FROM A MEMBER FROM SOUTH FLORIDA.
Jon: SLAM! I BET ALLEN WEST TOTALLY DISAGREES WITH HER PREMISE THAT CUT, CAP AND BALANCE RAISES  COSTS FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND HE'S GOING TO LAY DOWN A SUBSTANTIVE STATISTICAL  RECITATION OF THAT ACCUSATION. CONGRESSIONAL STYLE.
ALLEN WEST FIRED OFF THIS E-MAIL SAYING, "YOU WANT A PERSONAL FIGHT I'M HAPPY TO OBLIGE. YOU ARE THE MOST VILE, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DESPICABLE MEMBER OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME, STOP BEING A COWARD AND SAY IT TO MY FACE."  [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: SAY IT TO MY FACE. HOW DO YOU MAKE A FROWNING FACE IN MODICON? WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE, COLON PARENTHESES THERE? SEND.
OTHERWISE SHUT THE HECK UP. YOU HAVE PROVEN REPEATEDLY THAT YOU ARE NOT A LADY THEREFORE SHALL NOT BE AFFORDED DUE  RESPECT FROM ME.
Jon: ADDING PLEASE FIND ATTACHED AS A TOKEN OF MY DISRESPECT A PICTURE OF ANTHONY  WEINER'S [BLEEPED]. GOOD DAY. I SAID GOOD DAY. THAT THING STILL FREAKS ME OUT. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE BIT ABOUT NOT BEING A LADY GOT SOME ATTENTION OF SOME OF THE WOMEN  IN CONGRESS. THEY HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO INFORM ALLEN WEST THAT AS WOMEN HE CAN SUCK THEIR [BLEEPED].
ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IN ORDER TO BE A LADY, THAT WE NEED TO JUST STAY IN OUR PLACES.
IN ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT, HE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM FOR  CREATING A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT.
Jon: AND THIS HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT IS WHY WE WEAR THESE  ANCIENT AMULETS AROUND OUR NECK, TO PROTECT US FROM THE HOSTILITY. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THEY WORK. YOU ARE NOT A LADY. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE... I DON'T RESPECT... YOU CAN'T HER  ME WITH UNICORNS AND RAINBOWS. SON OF A... [LAUGHTER] WOW. WE KNOW HOW TO MAKE SMOKE GRAPHICALLY? THAT'S VERY NICE. ACTUALLY ALL THIS IS JUST A BACK STORY TO THE THING THAT REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION, WHICH WAS  ALLEN WEST'S RESPONSE TO THIS ENTIRE THING.
IN A STATEMENT TO NBC NEWS, HIS OFFICE SAYS, "CONGRESSMAN WEST DOES NOT HATE WOMEN."  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, "STATEMENTS OF CLARIFICATION THAT PROBABLY  WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD." LET'S WATCH.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, I ABHOR SLAVERY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I JUST POPPED IN HERE. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE STORY IS GOING ON HERE, ALL THE HUBBUB ABOUT THE MIGRAINES AND  ANYTHING, BUT DID I MISS A LARGER PREVIOUS ISSUE OR MICHELE BACHMANN CAME OUT IN FAVOR OF SLAVERY? BUT, OF COURSE, MY FAVORITE, FAVORITE ONE HAPPENED IN THE HEAT OF A CONVERSATION. SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH THE STATEMENT OF CLARIFICATION THAT PROBABLY WON'T DO FOX NEWS  PSYCHAIATRIST AND PART-TIME LEX LUTHER IMPERSONATOR KEITH ABLOW ANY GOOD.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU SEE A LITTLE GIRL AS HER BREASTS BEING  SEXUAL THAT THAT DOESN'T REFLECT MORE ON YOU.
I ASSURE YOU I'M NOT A PEDOPHILE AT ALL.
Jon: AT ALL. NAILED IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
