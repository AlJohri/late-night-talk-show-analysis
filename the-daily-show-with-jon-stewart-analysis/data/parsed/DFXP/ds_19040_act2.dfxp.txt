[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. EMOTION REPRESS, REPRESS. DON'T FEEL -- I'M BACK. SO LISTEN AS A STUDENT OF HISTORY ONE THING THAT WE'VE ALL LEARNED IS THAT EVEN THE MIGHTIEST DYNASTIES EVENTUALLY CRUMBLE. THE MING DYNASTY, FELLED BY PEASANT REBELLIONS. THE HAPSBURG DYNASTY, BROUGHT LOW BY WORLD WAR I AND UNWIELDY FACIAL HAIR. AND NOW A PROBLEM FOR THE PREEMINENT DYNASTY OF OUR AGE.
THE DUCK DYNASTY CHARACTERS LED BY THE FAMILY PATRIARCH ARE STARS IN THE REALITY SHOW UNIVERSE.  BUT IN AN ISSUE OF GQ PHIL ROBERTSON CALLED HOMOSEXUALITY SINFUL. JUST MORE  OUT FROM THERE BESTIALITY, THE DRUNKARDS THE SWINDLERS THEY WON'T INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD. IT'S NOT RIGHT.
Jon: YEAH, MAN IT'S ZZ TOP NOT ZZ BOTTOM. [ LAUGHTER ] FIRST OF ALL I DON'T WATCH YOUR DUCK DYNASTY THERE AND I ASSUMED IT WAS A SHOW WHERE DUCKS REENACTED THE SHOW DYNASTY. WHICH, BY THE WAY, WOULD HAVE A HUGE GAY AUDIENCE. BESIDES EQUATING BEING GAY WITH BESTIALITY HE REMINISCED ABOUT HOW MUCH HAPPIER HE RECALLED BLACK  HAPEOPLE WERE IN THE PRE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA, AND THAT NONE OF THEM DURING THAT TIME WERE UPSET AND WERE IN FACT SINGING IN THE FIELDS AND NO ONE WAS SINGING THE BLUES FORGETTING, OF COURSE, THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHEN AND WHERE THE BLUES WERE INVENTED. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE GLAAD FILED A COMPLAINT AND NAACP, WHICH MEANS SOMEONE ELSE IS ABOUT TO GET PRETTY UPSET.
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THIS IS THE WORD POLICE. POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
Jon: YES, I, TOO, HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WORD OF POLICE. IT'S BY FAR THE WORST LAW AND ORDER SPINOFF. I DON'T CARE FOR IT. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, I THINK WHAT THE GUY SAID IS IGNORANT BUT I HAVE AN INCLINATION TO SUPPORT A WORLD WHERE SAYING IGNORANT (bleep) ON TELEVISION DOESN'T GET YOU KICKED OFF THAT MEDIUM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT I GUESS I STAND WITH THE FREE SPEECH ABSOLUTISTS AT FOX NEWS WHO DON'T BELIEVE YOU SHOULD PRESSURE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO ADHERE TO CULTURAL NORMS OF SPEECH MOSTLY.
WHY ARE SO MANY TOWNS REMOVING THE WORD AND THE NAME CHRISTMAS.
ISN'T IT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CHRISTIANS BY CALLING IT A HOLIDAY TREE.
CHRISTMAS IS CHRISTMAS THE RELIGION FOR CHRISTIANS. RESPECT IT.
SOME PEOPLE ARE BUSY TRYING TO ERASE CHRISTMAS FROM OUR CULTURE.
IT'S NOT A XMAS TREE, IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE.
PEOPLE ARE GOING HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
DO YOU DEBATE THAT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF INSTANCES WHERE CHRISTMAS IS STRUCK FROM THE LEXICON.
WHO GIVES A RIP ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A WHITE OR RED POINSETTIA IS IN THE SCHOOL. IT DOESN'T HAVE JESUS ON IT. GET OVER IT. ARE THERE FLOWERS  WITH JESUS ON THEM? THEIR BELIEF IN FREE SPEECH DOESN'T EXTEND TO THE HOLIDAYS WHERE THE WORD CHRISTMAS IS MANDATORY. FOX WOULDN'T PRESSURE PEOPLE TO USE THE PHRASE MERRY CHRISTMAS.
THE GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND REFUSING TO CALL IT A CHRISTMAS TREE. INSTEAD HE'S CALLING IT THE HOLIDAY TREE. FOR FOLKS WATCHING RIGHT NOW THINKING THAT'S CRAZY I SHOULD CALL THE GOVERNOR. WE HAVE HIS PHONE  NUMBER.
WHEN DEPARTMENT STORES ORDERED THE EMPLOYEES NOT TO SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS WE WON THAT BECAUSE WE NAMED THEM AND NO ONE WENT SHOPPING THERE.
THEY CAN CALL YOUR RADIO SHOW AND CONTACT THE GOVERNOR.
TULSA'S HOLIDAY PARADE OF LIGHTS WILL GO ON AS SCHEDULED SATURDAY DESPITE THE PROTESTS.
FORTUNATELY THE PARADE WILL NOT SUFFER.
Jon: I END WITH THE SAGE WORDS OF FOX APPROVED CAST OF DUCK DYNASTY
HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY. >>HOLIDAYS.
