[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS AN ACTRESS. SHE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE WITH CELIAC DISEASE CALLED "JENNIFER'S WAY." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JENNIFER ESPOSITO. HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU. SO NICE TO BE HERE.
Jon: NICE TO HAVE YOU HERE.
HELLO. HELLO.
Jon: SO, SO THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "JENNIFER'S WAY," BY WAY OF REVELATION, MY SON HAS THIS AND HAS A VERY BAD CASE OF IT.
I KNOW, I HEARD. ME TOO.
Jon: YES. IT'S VERY PAINFUL, AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT IT'S A REAL THING.
I HAD TO CONVINCE PEOPLE FOR PROBABLY 20-SOMETHING YEARS.
Jon: YES.
GOING TO DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS SYMPTOM, THAT SYMPTOM, THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG, AND THEM LOOKING AT ME SAYING, MAYBE IT'S THIS, IT'S THAT, HERE'S SOME PROZAC.
Jon: SOME PROZAC?
AND IT'S LIKE REALLY? REALLY? IT'S NOT IN MY HEAD. I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY WRONG. AND, IT TOOK IT TO THE POINT WHERE, FOR ME, PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. THERE'S ABOUT 300 SYMPTOMS WITH THIS DISEASE. SO FOR ME...
Jon: WELL, EXPLAIN VERY QUICKLY...
YEAH.
Jon: SO CELIAC DISEASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT'S CALLED, LIKE GLUTEN SENSITIVITY,
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.
Jon: THE MORE FADDISH OF THOSE TYPES OF DIETS.
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AND THAT CAUSES US A SEVERE PROBLEM. BUT CELIAC DISEASE IS A AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE.
Jon: YES.
SO, WE CAN'T HAVE GLUTEN. IT BASICALLY, IT DESTROYS THE VILLI IN THE GUT, WHICH TAKES ALL THE NUTRIENTS FROM THE FOOD AND GIVES IT TO THE BODY. SO BASICALLY, BY THE TIME I WAS DIAGNOSED, MY FACE, MY SKIN WAS PEELING OFF. MY KNEES WERE BUCKLING, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT. I MEAN...
Jon: AND YOU, YOU HAD ACTUAL... THERE WERE SYMPTOMS THAT WERE EMOTIONAL, AS WELL.
EMOTIONAL BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE SERATONIN IN THE BODY IS IN THE GUT. SO ALL THE SERATONIN IS IN CHARGE OF MAKING YOU FEEL GOOD, YOUR MOOD, YOUR DEPRESSION, EVERYTHING. BUT FOR ME, IT ATTACKED MY NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO I GOT... I HAD PANIC ATTACKS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.
Jon: SEE NOW, FOR THE BOY, HE WAS HAVING THESE TERRIBLE EPISODES OF VOMITING AND THEN HE GOT ANEMIC,
YEAH.
Jon: AND WANDERED AROUND... AND WE JUST THOUGHT, WE WERE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED...
OF COURSE.
Jon: AND FRIGHTENED THAT HE WAS DYING.
OF COURSE.
Jon: WE DIDN'T... WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
AND THIS IS WHAT'S SO FRIGHTENING WHEN PEOPLE MAKE FUN OF THIS GLUTEN INTOLERANCE OR GLUTEN EATING. OH, WE'RE ALL ON FAD OR A DIET. THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE YOUR SON, THERE ARE PEOPLE, I'VE HEARD EVEN WORSE STORIES...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT ARE SERIOUSLY SUFFERING.
Jon: WELL, IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S A DISEASE.
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING. THIS BOOK SERIOUSLY, IT TOOK ME THREE YEARS TO WRITE. AND I WANTED TO WRITE IT EXACTLY FOR THIS REASON.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S A BOOK FOR EVERYONE WHO'S EVER HAD TO SAY SOMETHING'S WRONG AND REALLY BE YOUR OWN HEALTH ADVOCATE.
Jon: RIGHT, NOW TO BE, TO GET DIAGNOSED, THOUGH, THEY HAVE TO, THIS IS IMPORTANT, THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO AN ENDOSCOPY, THEY DO LIKE A BIOPSY OF YOUR LOWER INTESTINE. YOUR VILLI.
EXACTLY. THE SMALL INTESTINE. THE VILLI. SO BASICALLY THAT HAVE DO THAT. I MEAN, LOOK, THERE IS A BLOOD TEST, BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE. THEY TESTED ME FOR YEARS. IT WAS LIKE, OH, NOTHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NOW, YOU'VE STARTED A, THERE'S A, YOU DO YOU A BAKERY NOW CALLED JENNIFER'S WAY.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: DID YOU THINK, WELL IT'S A BAKERY, IT SHOULD BE A PUN, LIKE GLUTEN FOR PUNISHMENT? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. DID YOU EVER?
I HAVE TO TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, IT'S, I'M AN ITALIAN, AND TELLING ME THAT I COULDN'T HAVE GLUTEN AND DAIRY AND SOY...
Jon: OH IT MUST HAVE BEEN...
I WAS LIKE, I'M GOING TO BE VERY ANGRY OR I NEED BAKE AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. SO I OPENED THIS BAKERY. AND IT'S FOR ALL ALLERGENS. AND WE ACTUALLY JUST OPENED A WHOLE FACILITY THAT WE CAN SHIP ANYWHERE IN THE NATION. BECAUSE HONESTLY, CELIAC OR NOT, I THINK IT'S COMING TO A POINT WHERE FOOD IS SO MESSED UP THAT WE JUST WANT GOOD, CLEAN FOOD. GLUTEN-FREE OR NOT GLUTEN-FREE.
Jon: RIGHT.
JUST A CLEAN PRODUCT WITHOUT ALL THIS NONESENSE. [APPLAUSE]
I ACTUALLY THINK, THOUGH, IT'S VERY NICE, YOU KNOW, THE WAY FOOD IS GOING, I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING TO A CERTAIN POINT WHERE ACTUALLY EVERYTHING WILL BE GLUTEN FREE BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO FOOD IN IT.
THAT'S IT. IT'S AIR.
Jon: SO YOU'LL HAVE...
I MAKE BREAD OUT OF AIR.
Jon: RIGHT I'LL JUST, OH I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME PLASTIC Os.
EXACTLY, EXACTLY. IT'S GETTING TO THAT POINT.
Jon: AND IT FEELS VERY DELICIOUS.
Jon: I WILL SAY THIS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WENT TO BE DIAGNOSED, BUT WE FOUND A CENTER HERE IN NEW YORK UP AT COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN, AND IT WAS GREAT.
YEAH.
Jon: AND, THEY SAVED THE BOY'S EXISTENCE.
HIS LIFE, EXACTLY.
Jon: AND, IF YOU CAN STAY AWAY FROM IT, YOU REALLY DO START THE HEAL. THERE REALLY IS A CURE FOR THIS.
YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN HEAL. BUT WHAT I ALWAYS TELL EVERYONE, LOOK FOR ME, JUST TAKING AWAY GLUTEN WASN'T IT. AND IT IS AN AUTOIMUNE DISEASE. AND LIKE YOU KNOW WITH YOUR SON, IT'S EVERY DAY.
Jon: YEAH.
IT'S EVERY DAY AND EVERYTHING WE EAT, EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT TO DINNER. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE MAKING FUN OF THIS, IT'S REALLY NOT FUNNY BECAUSE GOING OUT THE DINNER IS NOT ENJOYABLE ANYMORE FOR ME.
Jon: NO. WELL, IT'S A DIFFERENT THING. I THINK THAT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THERE'S THIS WHOLE OTHER GROUP THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE BELIEVE HAVE JUMPED ON KIND OF IT AS A FAD...
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: LIKE YOU WOULD SOMETHING...
WHEN THEY SAY, LIKE THE FAT-FREE, BUT MY POINT IS THE FAT-FREE WASN'T ATTACHED TO A DISEASE. THIS IS ATTACHED TO A DISEASE.
Jon: YES. YES. THAT'S CORRECT. WELL, I'M GLAD IT'S HELPED YOU SO MUCH. IT'S HELPED HIM.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND NOW I DON'T FEEL GUILTY AT ALL FOR PUNISHING HIM WITH WRESTLING MOVES.
PERFECT.
Jon: I WILL, I WILL TAKE THIS BOY DOWN.
THAT'S IT.
Jon: SO CONGRATULATIONS ABOUT THIS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE FEELING GOOD.
I AM. I AM.
Jon: AND THE BAKERY IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.
THE BAKERY'S OPEN, YEAH, AND
Jon: AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEND IT ALL OVER THE WORLD?
JENNIFER'S WAY BAKERY DOT COM. YEAH.
Jon: OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT THAT SOUNDS...
IT'S BASICALLY... IF YOU GO THERE, AND I WILL SHIP YOU FOOD ANYWHERE.
Jon: REALLY, FOR NO MONEY?
NOTHING. FREE OF CHARGE.
Jon: JENNIFER ESPOSITO WILL SHIP YOU FOOD. "JENNIFER'S WAY" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THAT WITH US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: JENNIFER ESPOSITO.
