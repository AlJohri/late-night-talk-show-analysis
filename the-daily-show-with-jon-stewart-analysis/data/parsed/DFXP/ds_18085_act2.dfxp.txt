[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OH, DOCTOR! NOW LOUISVILLE'S BIG WIN OVER  MICHIGAN MONDAY NIGHT ENDING A  THRILLING NCAA TOURNAMENT WHICH SAW EVEN SAVVY BRACKET  PROGNOSTICATORS COMPLETELY  SCREWED BY PRODUCTION ASSISTANT JAY FRANKLIN WHO, THINK WE CAN  ALL ADMIT GOT COMPLETELY  (bleep) LUCKY. I MEAN, NOTE TO SELF:  FIRE JAY  FRANKLIN. DESPITE THE NCAA'S GOOD WORKS  THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD TRY TO  TEAR THEM DOWN. ASSIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
COLLEGE ATHLETES THEY ARE  PRINCES OF THEIR SCHOOLS AND  ENJOY EVERYTHING FROM THE LOVE OF ENTHUSIASTIC COACHES FROM ALL  THE ATTENTION THEY GET WHEN THEY  TWIST THEIR POOR LITTLE ANKLE OUT OF THEIR SKIN. BUT THERE'S SOME STUDENTS LIKE  THIS UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA  WRESTLER WHO WOULD SPIT IN THE FACE OF NCAA AND DEFY THEIR  PERFECTLY FAIR RULES.
MY ELIGIBILITY GOT TAKEN  AWAY. IT GOT SWIPED. I COULDN'T COMPETE FOR THE  UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA.
WHY DID THEY STRIP YOU OF  ELIGIBILITY.
I HAD A PHONE AND MY NAME WAS  ON IT.
WHY DID YOU THINK YOU COULD  USE YOUR OWN NAME.
IT'S MY MESSAGE AND IT'S ME.
IT'S NOT YOUR NAME. IT BELONGS TO THE NCAA.
THE NCAA RULES SAY ATHLETES  CAN'T PROFIT BY USING THEIR OWN  NAME IN A SONG THAT THEY WROTE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  SPORTS. DON'T FORGET THE NCAA IS GIVING  THEM THE GIFT OF EDUCATION.
I HAVE 10% SCHOLARSHIP. THAT DOESN'T COVER A LOT AND ON  TOP OF THAT A COVER MY LIVING  EXPENSES.
AND YOU ARE MAKING A BUTT  LOAD OF MONEY ON THE SONG.
THE SONG HASN'T MADE ME RICH. I HAVEN'T EVEN BROKEN EVEN. THE NCAA OWNS THE NAME JOEL  BAUMAN.
YOU ARE RAPPING UNDER THE  NAME JOEL BAUMAN, THAT'S THE  ACCOUNTANT OF THE RECORD LABEL. THE NCAA WANTS TO DISTANCE  THEMSELVES FROM HIS GANGSTA RAP  STYLE.
PUT YOUR ONES UP IF YOU WANT  YOUR DREAMS RIGHT NOW.
BUT YOU ARE A GOOD WRESTLER  THOUGH RIGHT?
I LIKE TO ASSUME SO.
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. I MEAN YOU ARE GOING TO KEEP  WRESTLING, RIGHT?
GOOD, GOOD.
YES THIS TYPE OF PROFITING  WOULD SULLY THE NCAA'S IMAGE AS  STEWARDS OF ATHLETICS THE MISSION IS TO EXROA TECT COLLEGE  SPORTS FROM THE INFLUENCES OF  COMMERCIALISM AND UPHOLD THE IDEAL OF THE STUDENT ATHLETE WHO  SIMPLY PLAYS FOR THE LOVE OF  SPORT. BUT EXUCLA BASKETBALL PLAYER ED  O'BANON THINK HE HE IS ENTITLED TO  MORE.
I THINK COLLEGE ATHLETES  SHOULD BE COMPENSATED.
WHAT FOR?
BECAUSE THERE IS AN  UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY,  BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING MADE OFF THE BACKS OF THESE ATHLETES  AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE  COMPENSATED EXCEPT FOR THE ONES DOING THE WORK.
OH, REALLY BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE  NCAA'S TOTAL REVENUE IS ONLY $6  BILLION SO IT'S NOT THAT MANY  BILLIONS. AND THOSE ONE SHINING MOMENT  MONTAGES DON'T PAY FOR  THEMSELVES. WE CAN'T SHOW YOU ANY OF THOSE  BECAUSE THE NCAA WON'T LICENSE  IT TO US. INSTEAD WE BRING YOU THIS. ♪ IT'S ONE SHINING MOMENT IT'S  ALL ON THE LINE ♪  ♪ IT'S FROZEN IN -- OKAY YOU GET THE IDEA. SOMEHOW O'BANON IS STILL  UNGRATEFUL AND SUING HIM FOR  USING HIS LIKENESS IN THEIR ONE MINOR LITTLE VIDEO GAME. NO, NOT THAT ONE. NO THE OTHER PLATFORM. NOT THE Wii, NOT THE XBOX. YES, THIS ONE, THAT ONE. I'M A VIDEO GAME. LAST AIR BENDER. I'M IN IT. NOBODY HAS PLAYED IT.
DID YOU GET PAID.
YEAH I GOT PAID (bleep) I'M  NOT A SCHUM SCHMUCK.
I STAND BY MY LAWSUIT. I STAND BY IT.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY WERE  SLAMMING THIS OPEN INSTITUTION  SO I WENT TO THE NCAA TO LET THEM RESPOND. I WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU TO  GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO CLEAR YOUR  GOOD NAME. FIRST QUESTION:  WHY AM I  TALKING TO A TELEPHONE?
THE NCAA IS NOT GRANTING ANY  ONCAMERA INTERVIEWS AT THIS  TIME.
WHAT ARE YOU PHILIP MORRIS? I HAVE SPOKEN TO A GUY WHO MAKES  ASBESTOS. YOU ARE THE NCAA.
OUR MISSION IS TO BE AN  INTEGRAL PART OF HIGHER  EDUCATION AND TO FOCUS ON THE --
IS THIS EVEN THE NCAA I'M  TALKING TO?
NO THIS IS YOUR INTERN ERIC. I'M JUST READING A STATEMENT  THEY GAVE US.
WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE,  THE ATHLETES KNOW THAT THE NCAA  WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM.
I ACTUALLY JUST CAME BACK. I WAS OUT FOR THREE MONTHS WITH  A CONCUSSION.
BUT THE SCHOOL WILL COVER THE  EXPENSES SHOULD THIS LEAD TO ANY  EXPENSES AFTER YOU GRADUATE,  RIGHT?
NO, BECAUSE I WON'T BE AN  ATHLETE FOR THEM ANYMORE.
ARE YOU (bleep) KIDDING ME. OKAY, I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHY  THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK US TO.
YEAH, THEY ARE KIND OF  DOUCHEBAGS. ♪ IT'S ONE SHINING MOMENT ♪
