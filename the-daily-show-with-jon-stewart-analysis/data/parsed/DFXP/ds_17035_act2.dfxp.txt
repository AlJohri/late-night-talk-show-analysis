THERE ARE SO MANY CONTROVERSIES, SO MANY CONTROVERSIES THIS HOLIDAY SEASON, BUT OF ALL OF THEM, ONLY ONE IS THE STUPIDEST.
THE MUPPETS ARE BACK AND BEING TERRORIZED BY AN EVIL OIL EXECUTIVE IN THEIR NEW MOVIE. I MEAN THIS IS A MUPPET MOVIE FOR GOODNESS SAKE. THE ONLY THING GREEN ON THAT SCREEN SHOULD BE KERMIT THE FROG.
CLASS WARFARE. IT'S TEACHING OUR KIDS CLASS WARFARE. WHERE ARE WE, COMMUNIST CHINA?
Jon: YES. I THINK HE MAY BE THINKING OF THE MAO-PETS. THEIR NEW MOVIE THE MAO-PETS. ARE THE MONEY ES COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA. WE TURN TO OUR RESIDENT DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN HODGSON.
I'M ON THE CANADIAN DOLLAR. PLEASE, SIR, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE MONEY. MONEY. BOW BEFORE YOUR GOD. MONEY TALKS.
JOHN HODGSON. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHAT IS THIS? WHAT IS THIS? THE MUPPETS ARE COMMUNISTS?
LET ME SAY OFF THE BAT I LOVE THE MUPPETS AS MUCH AS ANYBODIMENT YOU MAY NOT KNOW, MY  FATHER WAS A MUPPET. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU'RE HALF MUPPET? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HALF MUPPET. >>ABLE TO GOOD HALF, JON. FROM THE WAIST DOWN I'M ALL FELT. LADIES. THAT SAID, YOU CANNOT DENY THE MUPPETS ARE RADICAL MARXISTS.
Jon: I CAN ABSOLUTELY DENY THAT.
JON, THE VILLAIN OF THE MOVIE IS A C.E.O. CALLED TEX RICHMAN. HE GIVES THE MUPPETS UNTIL MIDNIGHT THE RAISE $10 MILLION OR HE'LL STAIR DOWN THEIR  INTERSPECIES NO-PANTS COMMUNE TO DIG FOR OIL. AND THE CRAZY PART IS THE MUPPETS DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. THEY'RE JUST LIKE THE REST OF HOLLYWOOD, ALWAYS DEMONIZING WEALTHY AMERICANS. MOVIEGOERS HAVE SEEN JOB CREATORS DEPICTED AS EVERYTHING FROM GREEDY WHITE COLLAR  CRIMINALS TO MURDEROUS PSYCHOPATHS TO GIANT LECHEROUS SLUGS.
JABBA DID FREEZE HAN SOLO FOR DUMPING THE CARBONITE HE WAS SMUGGLING.
FINE, NERD, BUT THE POINT IS IF THE RICH AND POWERFUL ARE DEPICTED AS GREEDY, BLOATED  SPACE TURDZ, THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN SAY OR DO THAT ISN'T GOING TO SOUND TERRIBLE.
WE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT. WE WILL NOT VANISH WITHOUT A FIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO LIVE ON. WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE. TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDENCE DAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I REST MY CASE.
THAT WASN'T THE WAY... THE MOVIES HAVE HAD VERY HEROIC RICH PEOPLE. BATMAN, THERE'S A BILLIONAIRE. HE FIGHTS CRIME.
OH, OH, I SEE. SO IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO BE RICH AS LONG AS I WEAR A MASK AND RISK MY LIFE FIGHTING CRIMINALS  WITHOUT SUPERPOWERS, MIND YOU, JUST GADGETS THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR MYSELF. WELL, GUESS WHAT, I ALREADY TRIED THAT. AS THE UNTOUCHABLE HEDGEHOG.
Jon: I REMEMBER THAT. ALL YOU DID IS CURL INTO A BALL AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH, MY FIGHTING TECHNIQUE HAS TO REFLECT MY ANIMAL PERSONA. DUH.
IF IT BOTHERS YOU, WHY DON'T YOU MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIES  ABOUT HOW GREAT RICH PEOPLE ARE.
WHY MAKE MOVIES WHEN I CAN SIMPLY REMAKE OLD MOVIES AND REMOVE THEIR ANTI-WEALTH BICE. IT'S A MATTER OF EDITING. TAKE IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, FOR EXAMPLE
Jon: HOLIDAY CLASSIC.
CLASSIC LEFT WING PROPAGANDA PIECE. WITH A LITTLE TRIMMING, IT CAN HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.
I SUPPOSE IT'S BETTER IF I HAD NEVER BEEN BORN AT ALL. ♪ ALUD LANG SYNE ♪♪  [LAUGHTER] JON YOUR HAPPY ENDING IS JIMMY STEWART COMMITTING SUICIDE?
YES. OBVIOUSLY. DID YOU SEE THIS MOVIE? JIMMY STEWART ALMOST DESTROYS HIS HOME TOWN BY EXTENDING RISKY MORTGAGES TO PEOPLE UNWORTHY OF  CREDIT, AND THE ONLY THING THAT SAVES HIM IS A HUGE PUBLIC BAILOUT.
Jon: THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS. THAT'S... [LAUGHTER] NOT CRAZY ABOUT THAT VERSION. I UNDERSTAND, MAYBE NOT ENOUGH CGI FOR YOU, WELL, WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE MY MAGNUM OPUS, THE  STORY OF INTERGALACTIC CAPITALISM I CALLED "PROFITAR."
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE, BECAUSE THIS LITTLE GRAY ROCK SELLS FOR $20 MILLION A KILO.
WELL, WHO AM I TO ARGUE WITH THE FREE MARKET. YOU HAVE A DEAL. I NEVER LIKED THAT DUMB TREE ANYWAY. THE WEALTH, IT'S TRICKLING DOWN. ♪ ALUD LANG SYNE ♪♪  [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU KNOW, I'M STARTING TO THINK RICH PEOPLE ARE EVIL.
OF COURSE WE ARE, OH, THAT REMINDS ME, I JUST BOUGHT YOUR  STUDIO AND I'M TEARING IT DOWN THE MAKE WAY FOR A CONDOMINIUM SLASH LUXURY STRIP MINE AND  THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN STOP ME, JON, THAT IS UNLESS YOU CAN SOMEHOW RAISE $10,000 BY MIDNIGHT. [MOO NIGH CAL LAUGHTER]
Jon: WAIT, THERE'S THE 11:45 BREAK DANCING CONTEST WITH A
