(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM CHELSEA CLINTON. COME ON.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: SO, SO THIS IS THE WEEK OR IS IT NEXT WEEK THAT THE CLINTON INITIATIVE GROUP GETS TOGETHER FOR THEIR ANNUAL MEETING IN NEW YORK, YES?
THAT'S RIGHT, NEXT WEEK.
Jon: NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING-- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE DOING THERE? DO YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THAT WEEK AS WELL?
I DO.
Jon: NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WELL, I HOPE YOU'LL COME.
Jon: TO THE --
I'M INVITING YOU.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE.
YEAH.
Jon: WHEN IS IT.
NEXT WEEK.
Jon: WILL THERE BE SNACKS.
ALWAYS.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL BE AS GOOD AS THE ONES YOU HAVE BACKSTAGE.
Jon: FUN SIZE CANDY. CAN'T BEAT IT.
BUT IF YOU COME I WILL MAKE SURE WE HAVE FUN SIZE CANDY.
Jon: I'M OUT HERE EVERY NIGHT SLAMMING IT OUT 22 MINUTES A DAY 4 DAYS A WEEK SO MY TIME IS VERY LIMITED WITH THIS SORT OF THING. WHAT ARE SO PROGRAMS THAT I WOULD SEE IF I WERE TO GO THERE.
OUR THEME THIS YEAR IS MOBILIZING FOR IMPACT. SO HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT WHAT PARTNERS SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE WHICH PROBLEMS. AND THE PANEL I'LL BE MODERATING IS REALLY FOCUSED ON NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES BECAUSE-- I KNOW.
Jon: I DID NOT THINK THAT WAS COMING.
THAT'S A MOUTHFUL.
Jon: NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE. >>IT'S CALLED NCD FOR SHORT.
Jon: DOESN'T SEEM THAT THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM IF YOU CAN'T CATCH IT.
INCREASINGLY NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM IT.
Jon: LIKE THAT WHAT WOULD THATEVEN ENTAIL?
HEART DISEASE.
Jon: IS IT HARD TO TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE ME SOMETIMES. NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE, I DON'T GET IT, WELL, THERE IS THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF HUMANS.
IT IS, ACTUALLY.
Jon: NO, I KNOW.
AROUND THE WORLD.
Jon: IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. AND SO EXCEPT FOR IN THE MOST LOW INCOME COUNTRIES, IT'S NOW THE NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO KILLER IN MUCH OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
Jon: BUT NOT IN THE NONDEVELOPING WORLD.
OH, NO IT IS DEFINITELY-- .
Jon: IT'S BAD HERE. SO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY'RE HOPING TO IMPLEMENT.
SO ONE OF THE REASONS I'M REALLY EXCITED TO DO THIS IS IN 2005 MY FATHER AFTER HIS QUADRUPLE HEART BY PASS SURGERY NOT ONLY REALLY CHANGED HIS LIFE, WHICH I'M GRATEFUL FOR AS A DAUGHTER, BUT HE REACHED OUT TO THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND SAID I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HEART HEALTH. WHAT I CAN DO. AND THEY SAID CHILDHOOD OBESITY, NOT WHAT HE WAS EXPECTING TO HEAR. AND SO NOW FAST FORWARD TO 2013. THE ALLIANCE FOR A HEALTHIER GENERATION, A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION IS NOW THE LARGEST ANTI-CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. SO WE WORK WITH MORE THAN 18,000 SCHOOLS, WE TOUCH MORE THAN 11.5 MILLION KIDS EVERY DAY THROUGH HEALTHIER LUNCH PROGRAMS, BETTER FOOD IN OUR SNACK MACHINES, NO FULL CALORIE SODAS IN THEIR SNACK AND SODA MACHINES.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE WORK THAT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION WITH MARGARET CHAN WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE WHO AND OTHER LEADERS WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING AROUND THE WORLD TO STEM THE TIDE OF OBESITY AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR NCD.
Jon: I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH MY KIDS CALLED GET UP.
AND MOVE HOPEFULLY.
Jon: GET OFF THE COUCH.
AND YOU LEAD OBVIOUSLY.
Jon: SO MANY FACTORS ARE STACKED AGAINST PEOPLE NOW. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WE PRODUCE FOOD NOW. IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT WAY THAN WE PRODUCED IT YEARS AGO. AND ISN'T SO MUCH OF HOW WE MANUFACTURE IT PART OF THE CONCERN. THE LOW COST, HIGH FRUCTOSE FOOD THAT HELPS TO FEED PEOPLE, OF LOW INCOME, ALSO HELPS TO GIVE THEM THESE TYPES OF DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE. HOW DO YOU BATTLE-- DON'T YOU HAVE TO BATTLE POVERTY AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE BATTLING EXERCISE AND THINGS AND DOESN'T THAT MAKE IT A MUCH MORE COMPLEX AN DIFFICULT PROBLEM.
IT IS COMPLEX. BUT IT'S ALSO JUST A LOT OF SMALLER PROBLEMS THAT ARE AGGREGATED TOGETHER WAITING TO BE BROKEN DOWN. SO THEN WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, WHAT IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE CLINTON FOUNDATION TO BRING THOSE DIFFERENT PARTIES TOGETHER AND PROVE THAT WE REALLY CAN STEM THE TIDE OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY. AND MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS, WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE RATES OF INCREASE HAVE STOPPED. SO EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT-- .
Jon: THEY HAVE STABILIZED SO WE HOPE TO DECREASE THOSE NUMBERS SOON.
Jon: IT'S A BIG THING TO TAKE ON. IS THIS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE CARTER FOUNDATION, LOOK AT THEM, THEY ERADICATED GUINEA WORM, WE BETTER GET ON THIS THING LIKE IT'S A COMPETITION NOW BETWEEN THE CARTER FAMILY AND ITS CLINTON FAMILY.
I'M OKAY WITH THAT COMPETITION.
Jon: CARTER IS OUT THERE GOING LOOK AT ME, I'M GETTING RID OF MALARIA AND YOU ARE LIKE CHILDHOOD OBESITY.
IT'S A GREAT COMPETITION. I WOULD ALWAYS BE HAPPY TO BE IN THAT RACE.
Jon: I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT RACE. WAS IT DIFFICULT, YOUR FATHER HAS BEEN ON THIS PROGRAM MANY, MANY TIMES.
AND HE WANTED ME TO SAY HE'S JEALOUS  I'M HERE AN HE'S NOT.
Jon: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
IT'S TRUE. I SAW HIM THIS AFTERNOON.
Jon: HE'S SO SMART AND HAS SUCH A COMMAND OF FACTS THAT I THOUGHT BEING HIS KID MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE-- HOW DO YOU WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH THAT DUDE? LIKE WHERE IT'S JUST, HE COULD JUST QUOTE YOU FACTS AND THIS IS WHY YOUR CURFEW IS AT 10, LIKE YOU COULD NEVER-- DID YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU GOT THE BETTER OF HIM WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER?
WELL ONE OF MY MOST FORMATIVE MEMORIES WAS DURING THE 1986 GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION IN ARKANSAS. IT WAS A REALLY NASTY ELECTION.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THERE OBVIOUSLY WERE THREE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY, MY MOM, MY DAD AND ME. AND THERE WAS AN UPCOMING DEBATE SO IT WAS GOING TO BE MY FATHER AGAINST HIS OPPONENT WITH A MODERATOR. AND THE THREE OF US OVER MANY EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS WOULD PLAY DIFFERENT ROLES IN ADVANCE OF THIS DEBATE. I WOULD HAVE TO PRETEND TO BE MY FATHER'S OPPONENT AND ARGUE POSITIONS AGAINST HIM.
Jon: HOW OLD WERE YOU.
I WAS SIX. I WOULD BE MY FATHER, AND HE WOULD BE HIS OPPONENT. AND SO YOU KNOW THAT JUST-- .
Jon: HOW MUCH FUN MUST THAT HAVE BEEN AS A SIX-YEAR-OLD.
I WAS TAUGHT TO HOLD MY OWN AT A PRETTY EARLY AGE.
Jon: YOU ARE NOT KIDDING. IF IT WERE MY KIDS THEY WOULD WANT TO HAVE DRESSED UP LIKE THAT BUT NOT STAYED WITH IT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF IT. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO-- THEY WORKED IN GOVERNMENT FOR SO LONG. THEY STILL WORK IN GOVERNMENT. YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO NOT DO THAT ROUTE. IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT USING THESE NGOs AND OTHER MEANS THAT MAYBE WATCHING SOME OF THEIR FRUSTRATION -- FRUSTRATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY AND THE WAY THE MECHANISM AND LEVERS OF THAT POWER WORK, THAT LEADS YOU INTO THIS OTHER DIRECTION, IS IT THAT PURPOSEFUL.
IT IS PURPOSEFUL FOR THIS POINT IN MY LIFE. WHEN I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE I WANTED TO SPEND MY TIME, INVEST MY ENERGY AND I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR, I COULDN'T IMAGINE AN ORGANIZATION I WANTED TO WORK WITH MORE THAN THE CLINTON FOUNDATION. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I'M COMPLETELY BIASED TOWARDS MY PARENTS. BUT I-- .
Jon: THE IDEA THAT EVEN YOU WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR PARENTS. LIKE IF MY KIDS WOULD EVEN VISIT ME WHEN THEY GET TO BE YOUR AGE, LIKE I'LL BE SO EXCITED, LIKE, I JUST THINK THAT THAT IS NICE THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE LIKE-- YOU WITHOUT REBEL AND BE LIKE THAT'S IT.
I TRIED TO CARE ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND I TRIED REALLY HARD TO WANT TO DENOMINATE SUCCESS IN MY LIFE DIFFERENTLY THAN MY PARENTS BECAUSE I THINK MOST KIDS PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO GROW UP AND FEEL LIKE THEY DEFAULTED INTO WHATEVER THEIR PARENTS HAVE DONE, THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY THE GALVANIZING ROLE MODELS IN THEIR LIVES. BUT ULTIMATELY I DID REALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT MY PARENTS CARED ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO WORK ON.
Jon: THAT'S WHY YOU ARE A GOOD KID.
I'M STILL TRYING TO MAKE MY PARENTS PROUD.
Jon: THAT'S NICE. I SHOULD DO THAT.
I BET YOU DO EVERY NIGHT.
Jon: WE'LL TALK AFTERWARDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY TODAY.
THANK YOU.
Jon: PLEASE TELL YOUR POP AND YOUR MOM I SAID HEY. CHELSEA CLINTON, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE)
