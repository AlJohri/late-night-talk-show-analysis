FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon:  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR HELAINE  OLEN. SHE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HER  BOOK "POUND FOOLISH" ABOUT THE  FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND HOW IT'S SERVING YOU PERFECTLY. [LAUGHTER] LET'S BEGIN WITH THE PRESIDENT. AS YOU MAY KNOW BARACK OBAMA IS  A STUDENT OF HISTORY. HE LEARNED TWO THINGS IN  PARTICULAR FROM THE GREATEST  PRESIDENT IN HISTORY ABRAHAM  LINCOLN. ONE WHEN PUTTING TOGETHER A  CABINET YOU NEED ASSEMBLE A TEAM  OF RIVALS AND TWO, YOU CANNOT KILL A VAMPIRE WITH AN AXE. YOU NEED A BUILT-IN SHOTGUN IN  THAT MOTHER HUMPER. LINCOLN THE VAMPIRE. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] DIDN'T TAKE OFF LIKE WE THOUGHT  IT WOULD. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT TO THE FIRST POINT WHEN IT  CAME TIME TO CHOOSE A SECRETARY  OF DEFENSE BARACK OBAMA DEMONSTRATED LINCOLN-ESQUE TEAM  RIVALLING BY CHOOSING FORMER  NEBRASKA SENATOR CHUCK HAAAG -- HAGGE -- HAGEL. [ LAUGHTER ] HE IS A REPUBLICAN. A TWO TERM SENATOR, VIETNAM VET. HE WAS A SIMPLE PROCESS AWAY  FROM ACHIEVING THAT RELATIVELY  ONLY MINOR AS SECRETARY OF LINCOLN'S LEGACY BUT STILL IT  WAS DOING THIS HAVING HAGEL OR  DOING THAT AND YOU KNOW, NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.
THE ONE THING I'M NOT GOING  TO DO IS VOTE ON A NEW SECRETARY  OF DEFENSE UNTIL THE OLD SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LEON  PANETTA, WHO I LIKE VERY MUCH,  TESTIFIES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN  BENGHAZI.
Jon: SO CLOSE TO GET HIM  CONFIRMED FOILED BY SENATE  THESPIAN LINDSEY GRAHAM. REPRIZING HIS ROLE FROM  TENNESSEE WILLIAMS GREAT WORK "A  STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE" NOT TO BE PRIMARY IDEA BY THE LOCAL TEA  PARTY. NO VOTE FOR HAGEL UNTIL PANETTA  ANSWERS QUESTIONS ABOUT  BENGHAZI. [LAUGHTER] WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TEN JEWS SIT  IN A ROOM AND TRY TO COME UP  WITH PUNS REALLY. STARTS THAT WAY EVERY MORNING,  ACTUALLY. SO TWO WEEKS AGO LINDSEY RHETT  GRAHAM HAD HIS RAISIN --  WHATEVER IT'S A PLAY.
DID THE PRESIDENT SHOW ANY  CURIOSITY ABOUT HOW IS THIS  GOING? WHAT KIND OF ASSETS DO YOU HAVE  HELPING THESE PEOPLE? DID HE EVER MAKE THAT PHONECALL?
LOOK, THERE'S NO QUESTION IN  MY MIND THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AMERICAN LIVES.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DON'T  BELIEVE IT'S A CREDIBLE  STATEMENT.
Jon: OH, WITH ALL DUE  RESPECT, THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT  CARE FOR HE IS A CAD AND A  SCOUNDREL. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S A PLAN AS THE ALABASTER  TONE IN MY CREAMY SKIN AND AS  SIMPLE AS MY MAID KICKED IN THE HEAD BY A DONKEY. THIS PRESIDENT LIES LIKE ALL THE  OTHER MEN WHO WOO YOU WITH THEIR  LIVES AND LEAVE BEHIND NOTHING BUT BROKEN DREAMS AND A TORN  COTTON NEGLIGEE YOU ORDERED  SPECIAL FROM A YANKEE CATALOG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THE POINT IS HE GOT HIS  PANETTA TESTIMONY. SO NOW THE SENATE CAN FINALLY GO  FORWARD WITH HAGEL'S  CONFIRMATION AND THE C.I.A. DIRECTORSHIP. THE GENERAL BUSINESS OF THE  SENATE, CUT TO THREE DAYS AFTER  PANETTA'S TESTIMONY.
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW  BRENNAN TO GO FORWARD FOR THE  C.I.A. DIRECTORSHIP, HAGEL TO BE CONFIRMED AS SECRETARY OF  DEFENSE UNTIL THE WHITE HOUSE  GIVES US AN ACCOUNTING. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUR  PRESIDENT DID. WHAT DID HE DO AS COMMANDER IN  CHIEF? DID HE CALL ANYBODY?
Jon: YOU SAID AFTER  PANETTA. HAGEL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  BENGHAZI WHICH IS AS GOOD AS ANY  OTHER REASON I'VE HEARD TO CONFIRM HIM. GET THE OTHER GUY OUT OF THERE,  RIGHT? MONTHS OF MEDIA INQUIRIES AND  ANY NUMBER OF CLASSIFIED  BRIEFINGS. KEEP PURSUING IT. THAT'S FINE BUT WHY BRING THE  COUNTRY'S BUSINESS TO A HALT? YOU KNOW WHO IS NOT GOING TO PUT  UP WITH THIS YOUR PAL JOHNNY  McCAIN BECAUSE HE LIVES BY A DIFFERENT CODE. IN A TIME OF TROUBLE AND DANGER  FOR OUR COUNTRY, WHO WILL PUT  OUR COUNTRY FIRST? [CROWD RESPONDS JOHN McCAIN]
Jon: THEY JUST SHOUTED  SOMETHING AT HIM. THAT'S RIGHT JOHN McCAIN  DOESN'T HAVE TIME, GRAHAM, FOR  YOUR CHEAP POLITICAL GAMES. HE WILL GET THIS TRAIN BACK ON  TRACK LIKE THE STRAIGHT TALK  EXPRESS.
I DO NOT BELIEVE WE SHOULD  MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS  NOMINATION UNTIL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED THAT SENATOR GRAHAM AND  SENATOR AYOTTE AND I HAVE ASKED  TO BE ANSWERED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT THE HELL. SORRY BUT IT'S HARD TO TAKE YOUR  TENACITY ON BENGHAZI AS HONEST  FACT FINDING GIVEN, MR. McCAIN, SOME OF YOUR PAST  HISTORY ON THE SUBJECT.
McCAIN DID NOT APRIL TEND  THE CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ON  BENGHAZI YESTERDAY.
HE WAS HAVING A PRESS  CONFERENCE CALLING FOR THE  SELECT COMMITTEE COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT GETTING ENOUGH  INFORMATION.
Jon: MR. McCAIN HERE IS  THE INFORMATION YOU REQUESTED. NOT NOW, CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY  DEMANDING THE INFORMATION YOU  HAVE IN YOUR HAND AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO GIVE TO ME. AND GET OFF MY LAWN YOU SON OF  A -- [LAUGHTER] SENATOR McCAIN WHAT THE HELL  IS GOING ON HERE?
WE'VE HAD A MASSIVE COVERUP. A COVERUP.
OF WHAT?
OF THE INFORMATION CONCERNING  DEATHS OF FOUR BRAVE AMERICANS. THE INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN  FORTHCOMING.
YOU SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF  CONFUSION.
DO YOU CARE DAVID --
I'M ASKING -- I'M ASKING YOU  DO YOU CARE WHETHER FOUR  AMERICANS DIED?
Jon: WHAT, WHOA, WHOA, DO  YOU CARE -- WHOA, STOP THIS  TRAIN! WHAT? I SAY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STOPPING THE TRAIN WITH SOME  KIND OF DEVICE YOU REALLY DON'T  FIND ON TRAINS. [ LAUGHTER ] NO! McCAIN, YOU CAN TAKE THAT  WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE  IT. [ LAUGHTER ] NO, McCAIN, YOU DON'T GET TO  PULL THE FOURTH DEAD  AMERICANS -- (bleep), YOU LOST THAT PRIVILEGE OVER I DON'T KNOW  THE IRAQ WAR WHICH I BELIEVE  AMERICAN CASUALTYWISE WAS LITERALLY BENGHAZI TIMES 1,000. AND FAR FROM HOLDING UP ALL  SENATE BUSINESS UNTIL THAT  FIASCO WAS RESOLVED I THINK YOU HAD A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT  PERSPECTIVE.
IS THE SENATE GOING TO HAVE A  FULL INVESTIGATION OF WHAT LED  UP TO IRAQ?
I THINK WE HAVE  INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND WE  HAVE HAD INVESTIGATIONS -- I'M NOT AGAINST INVESTIGATIONS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE  DON'T WASTE A LOT OF TIME AND  ENERGY.
Jon: DON'T YOU CARE? DON'T YA CARE ABOUT DEAD  AMERICANS? DON'T YA? LET ME FINISH DON'T YA CARE? DON'T YA? WHAT WAS THE MANTRA THEN WAS IT  EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE FROM THE  IRAQ DEBACLE FROM THE FAULTY INTELLIGENCE TO 50 TONS OF  MUSTARD GAS ON A TURKEY FARM TO  COLIN POWELL AND HIS VILE OF CONFECTIONERS ANTHRAX THAT THEY  ALL MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WAS  WAS THIS?
EVERY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN  THE WORLD BELIEVED SADDAM  HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF MASS  DESTRUCTION. THING GOES BAD IN WARS. MISTAKES HAPPEN. WHEN THINGS GO BAD, THINGS GO  BAD. THE WAR OF MISMANAGED. WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW. MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE. THEY'VE BEEN WELL CHRONICLED IN  COVERT TO AND FIASCO.
Jon: A LOT OF BOOKS FIASCO,  (bleep) BRAIN ADVENTURE. THERE WAS THAT BOOK "BOY WHERE  WE WRONG."  THERE WAS "FIST SHADES OF  WRONG."  THAT WAS BOOK "OOPS BASED ON THE NOVEL WRONG BY SAPPHIRE. OH, YEAH THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU  MEET IN HEAVEN WHO KNEW YOU WERE  WRONG. I GET IT THINGS GO BAD. WE ARE WHERE WE ARE. THE ONLY THING THAT WOL MAKE  THIS WORSE WOULD BE IF NOT ONLY  WAS McCAIN HYPOCRITICAL ABOUT HIS LEVEL OF OUTRAGE BUT IF THE  LEVEL OF OUTRAGE FUELING THE  HAGEL FILIBUSTER WAS WITH A HINT OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL  PETTINESS.
IT GOES BACK TO THERE'S A HAD  THE OF ILL WILL TOWARDS SENATOR  HAGEL BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS A REPUBLICAN HE ATTACKED PRESIDENT  BUSH MERCILESSLY AT ONE POINT  SAID HE WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT SINCE HERBERT HOOVER, SAID THAT  THE SURGE WAS THE WORST BLUNDER  SINCE THE VIETNAM WAR WHICH IS NONSENSE AND WAS VERY ANTI-HIS  OWN PARTY AND PEOPLE. PEOPLE DON'T FORGET THAT.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, BUSH WAS  THE WORST PRESIDENT SINCE  HERBERT HOOVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND SECOND -- -- SECOND, YOU  (bleep) HATED HIM. HAAAATED HIM. HATED. AND THIRD BLOCKING A SECRETARY  OF DEFENSE NOMINEE THAT HAS  NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR CURRENT REDISCOVERED MORAL OUTRAGE AT  AMERICAN DEATHS OVERSEAS WHILST  COPPING TO MAYBE A LITTLE PAYBACK IS THE ANTITHESIS OF  YOUR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN SO PARDON  ME, SIR, BUT PERHAPS IT NEEDS AN  UPDATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
