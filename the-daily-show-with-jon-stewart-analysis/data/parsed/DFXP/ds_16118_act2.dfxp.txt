(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, CHINA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW WHILE OURS SEEMS TO SHRINK AND FALTER. IT'S NOT JUST OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT ARE GOING OVERSEAS. WHY YET CENAC CENAC HAS MORE.
Jon:
EXTRATERRESTRIALS HAVE FASCINATED MAN FOR CENTURIES AND PERHAPS NO ONE IS MORE  FASCINATED THAN CLIFFORD CLIFF, THE PRESIDENT OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT MONITORS U.F.O. ACTIVITY.
WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO COME TO SOME RESOLUTION AS TO WHAT THESE OBJECTS ARE.
YET, SADLY, LIKE SO MANY OTHER BUSINESSES, MUFON HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES AND THE  REASON IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR.
WE'RE FINDING THAT THERE ARE MORE CREDIBLE U.F.O. SIGHTINGS  COMING FROM CHINA IN THAT AREA IN THE WORLD THAN WE ARE RECEIVING IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE SAYING CHINA IS RUSHING US?
RIGHT NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE.
THAT'S RIGHT. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE U.S. WAS A CHOICE DESTINATION FOR ALIENS BUT THANKS TO CHINA, ALL WE HAVE LEFT NOW IS ALF. WHY ARE THERE MORE IN CHINA THAN IN THE U.S.?
CHINA'S BECOMING MORE ADVANCED IN SPACE. THEY'RE WANTING TO GO TO THE MOON AND SET UP BASES ON THE MOON. THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT THE U.F.O.s ARE INTERESTED IN.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE CHINESE ARE GETTING THE AGE PROBLEMS THAT  AMERICANS JUST DON'T WANT.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE BEING PROBED THAT MUCH.
BUT AT THIS TIME WHEN CHINA IS WINNING, WE'VE DECIDED TO  SHUTTER OUR SPACE PROGRAM AND ALL NASA CAN DO IS REST ON ITS LAURELS.
TODAY YOU'RE IN THE COCKPIT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE "DISCOVERY."  S THAT TRULY TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT OF HUMANKIND.
DOES ANY OF THIS CRAP BRING ALIENS HERE?
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S BRINGING ANY ANGELS TO THE PLANET, NO.
WELL, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? BECAUSE THE CHINESE, THEY ARE LAUGHING AT US.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOT EXACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ATTRACTING ANY ALIENS AS PART OF NASA'S PROGRAM.
YOU'VE GOT NO PLANS? YOU'RE NASA!
WE'VE NOT GO NO ALIEN PLANS.
WHERE NASA STEPS DOWN, MUFON STEPS UP.
OUR STAR TEAM ARE TRAINED FIELD INVESTIGATORS WILL THAT ARE ABLE TO BE DEPLOYED WITHIN  24 HOURS TO A SIGNIFICANT U.F.O. EVENT. USUALLY THEY'RE RETIRED BECAUSE ALL OF OUR PEOPLE ARE VOLUNTEERS WYATT.
BUT TO PULL EVEN WITH CHINA, MUFON CAN'T DO IT ALONE.
NASA'S MISSION IS TO... IT'S REALLY FOR THE BETTER. OF HUMANKIND.
BUT DO YOU HAVE A STAR TEAM?
NO, BUT...
DO YOU HAVE GEIGER COUNTERS AND OLD PEOPLE TO USE THEM?
NO, WE DON'T HAVE GEIGER COUNTERS AND OLD PEOPLE TO USE THEM.
WOW. YEAH. I CAN SEE WHY THEY CUT YOUR FUNDING. NASA JUST HAD NOTHING TO OFFER. CENAC TO BEAM UP. CENAC OUT. WHAT A PIECE OF (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) BUT TOO GET AMERICA BACK ON TRACK. EVEN MUFON WOULD HAVE TO OVERCOME A FEW OBSTACLES.
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COMMUNE ATE. IF WE HAD THAT ABILITY THEN WE COULD SAY, HEY, GUYS, COME ON DOWN, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
FORTUNATELY, I KNEW SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP.
HELLO, HUMAN.
HI,
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADOR.
WE CAN DO THAT. CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE FROM?
KWAN US THE 5.
NEAR PALLADES.
YES.
ARE YOU MALE OR FEMALE?
I AM EVERYTHING. MY GENITALS ARE IN MY FINGERS. WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS AND CLIFF EVEN HAD A SURE-FIRE PLAN TO BRING THE ALIENS BACK TO AMERICA. WHAT DOES AMERICA HAVE TO DO TO GET BACK ON TOP.
SET OFF SOME NUCLEAR BOMBS, SEND SOME MISSILES TO SPACE. THEY'RE READY TO GO WHEREVER WE ARE.
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE. WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON, WE'RE BACK. (LAUGHTER)
