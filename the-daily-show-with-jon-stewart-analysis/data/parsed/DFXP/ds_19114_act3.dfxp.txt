(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HELLO! MY GUEST TONIGHT! GOT A NEW FILM OUT CALLED "EDGE OF TOMORROW." ♪♪
STOP! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! STOP!  WAIT A SECOND! WAIT A SECOND! WAIT A SECOND! BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THINKING, I MEAN, THIS THING IS IN MY BLOOD, SO MAYBE THERE'S SOME WAY I CAN TRANSFER IT TO YOU.
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING. IT DOESN'T WORK.
HAVE YOU, YOU KNOW -- TRIED ALL -- ALL THE OPTIONS?
OH, YOU MEAN SEX? YEAH, TRIED IT.
HOW MANY TIMES?
ALL RIGHT...
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, TOM CRUISE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: PLEASE. YOU.
TOGETHER? TOGETHER?
TOGETHER? TOGETHER?
THANK YOU.
GOOD LUCK WITH THIS THING! LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I DON'T GO OUT MUCH, BUT I WENT OUT TO SEE THIS. I WENT OUT TO SEE THIS FILM I WENT OUT OF MY HOUSE, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU. AND YOU DELIVER. THIS IS A VERY, VERY GOOD MOVIE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I VERY MUCH ENJOYED IT. IT'S A, A, WERE YOU EVER A VIDEO GAMER? DID YOU EVER PLAY VIDEO GAMES?
YOU KNOW, PLAYED A LITTLE BIT, BUT YOU GET TOO BUSY. YOU'RE A GAMER?
Jon: NO!
YOU'RE A GAMER A LITTLE BIT?
Jon: NO, I WAS DATING GIRLS, MOSTLY.
JUST A LITTLE BIT? JUST A FEW NIGHTS?
Jon: I MIGHT HAVE WOKEN MY WIFE UP OCCASIONALLY AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING AND SAID, I SAVED THE WORLD! (LAUGHTER) YEAH, AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO TRANSFER THAT AESTHETIC TO FILMS VERY OFTEN. I KNOW THIS ISN'T BASED ON A VIDEO GAME, BUT IT'S THE FIRST MOVIE I'VE SEEN THAT CAPTURES THE IDEA OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO PLAY IT, THE IDEA OF -- TELL THEM THE CONCEIT OF IT AND, AND --
IT IS A SUBJECTIVE REALITY OF THIS CHARACTER IS YOU SEE HE DOESN'T WANT THIS POWER. HE IS ACTUALLY A P.R. GUY. AND THE WOMAN PLAYED BY EMILY BLUNT, GREAT ACTRESS, SHE'S REALLY THE HERO. MY CHARACTER'S VERY MUCH, HE STUMBLES UPON GETTING THIS ALIEN SUPERPOWER THAT'S BASICALLY GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD, AND IT --
Jon: CAN YOU SAY WHAT IT IS OR ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED --
SURE, YOU CAN SAY IT. YEAH HELP ME, HELP ME.
Jon: HE REBOOTS EVERY TIME HE DIES, IT'S LIKE A GROUNDHOG DAY SCENARIO, EVERY TIME HE DIES IT'S LIKE PLAYING A VIDEO GAME. SO YOU DO IT UNTIL YOU SCREW IT UP, AND THEN DIE AND YOU GET ANOTHER CHARACTER. AND YOU REBOOT AT THE SAME PLACE.
YES. WELL, HE'S THE SAME GUY.
Jon: BUT HE LEARNS THE PATTERN OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD.
YES, YES, AND THAT'S HOW THE ALIENS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAT MANKIND.
Jon: AND NOW YOU HAVE THE POWER.
YES. WHICH HE DOESN'T WANT.
Jon: WELL, HE'S KIND OF A COWARD.
YES. YEAH, HE JUST FEELS LIKE HE'S JUST NOT THE GUY FOR IT.
Jon: YES. HE'S NOT.
SHE THE ONE, SHE'S THE ONE THAT SHOULD DO IT.
Jon: YES! CORRECT.
SO THAT SCENE WAS ME TRYING TO SAY LOOK, YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS, YOU'RE BETTER THAN I AM. AND SHE'S TRAINING HIM.
Jon: SHE IS BETTER THAN HE IS!
YES! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND YOU'RE TRAINED AND DEVELOPED THE RELATIONSHIP. THAT WAS THE ONLY THING I THOUGHT FOR A GAMER THAT WAS A LITTLE OFF IS THE IDEA THAT, OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A GIRL HERE. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT WAS WEIRD. THAT WAS WEIRD. BUT HOW DO YOU -- YOU KNOW, SO THIS IS SOMETHING, SO WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM? IT'S NOT -- OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE. YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU GREW UP. YOU GREW UP AS TOM CRUISE. I GREW UP ALSO IN MY UNDERWEAR IN MY HOUSE DANCING TO MUSIC ALONE, BUT NOBODY GAVE A (BLEEP). ALL RIGHT. BUT HOW DOES THIS -- SO WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM? BECAUSE THIS IS NOT BASED ON A GAME, NO?
IT'S BASED ON A JAPANESE NOVEL. AND BASICALLY JUST THAT CONCEIT, THAT CONCEPT WAS THERE.
RIGHT. AND DOUG LIMAN CAME TO ME THREE YEARS AGO WITH THIS IDEA.
RIGHT. GREAT DIRECTOR.
GREAT DIRECTOR. GREAT GUY. AND, SO WE JUST WORKED ON THE SCRIPT TOGETHER AND ON THE MOVIE AND GOT EMILY BLUNT AND CHRIS MCQUARRIE CAME ON AND WROTE.
Jon: THE THING THAT REALLY STRUCK ME TOO, IS IT'S REALLY QUITE FUNNY, I SAW IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND THERE WAS REALLY A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHTER AND NOT AT THE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T WANT IT. A LOT OF TIMES YOU WILL BE IN A SCREENING AND EVERYBODY WILL LAUGH THAT LAUGH LIKE, OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DID THAT... BUT EVERYBODY WAS TRULY ENGAGED AND INTO IT AND THAT'S NOT EASY TO PULL OFF IN THAT GENRE.
NO, IT WAS A TRICKY, TRICKY STRUCTURE AND ALSO IT'S JUST YEAH, WE WANTED TO MAKE IT REALLY ENTERTAINING AND FUN FOR AN AUDIENCE. AND FUNNY. AND FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO PLAY, I LOVE CHARACTER COMEDY AND THIS IS LIKE WILEY COYOTE.
YES. I KEPT TELLING THE STUNT GUYS, YOU HAVE TO THROW ME AGAINST THE WALL HARDER.
THEY DID. >>THEY DID AND I FINALLY WENT, THAT'S HARD ENOUGH. THAT'S GOOD.
Jon: IT WAS NICE THEY TOOK YOUR NOTE BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT OF MOMENTS -- AND AGAIN THE SURPRISING THING AS THE END, WHEN THE ALIENS WIN AND THE EARTH IS OVERRUN AND --
WE WANTED A SURPRISING ENDING, SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
Jon: IT WAS BERGMANESQUE. IT JUST SAID "FIN." AND THEN EVERYTHING WAS GONE. IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND QUITE DIFFERENT. (LAUGHTER) IT'S REALLY GREAT AND COMING OUT THIS WEEKEND, YES? DO YOU GET NERVOUS BEFORE THE BIG WEEKEND? BEFORE THE BIG PUSH? OR THAT'S OVER NOW, YOU'VE DONE IT ENOUGH AND --
YOU'VE DONE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM SO MANY TIMES AND IT'S JUST THAT POINT WHERE YOU'RE EXCITED FOR AUDIENCES TO FINALLY EXPERIENCE IT.
THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S A WONDERFUL, BECAUSE  I MAKE IT FOR THEM, SO THAT'S AN EXCITING TIME. IT'S, LIKE, LET'S JUST DO IT AND GET IT OUT.
Jon: YOU DON'T NECESSARILY GO INTO A ROOM WITH A BUCKET OF HAAGEN-DAZ AND CURL UP.
SOMETIMES WE GO AND CHECK OUT THEATERS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
Jon: YOU'RE REALLY NOT A GAMER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: "EDGE OF TOMORROW," IN THE THEATERS FRIDAY. TOM CRUISE!
