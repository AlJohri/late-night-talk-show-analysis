WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE PUT A SHOW TOGETHER FOR YOU TONIGHT. ONE OF OUR FAVORITES IS GOING TO BE JOINING US FROM THE MOVIE PRISONERS, JAKE GYLLENHAAL WILL BE JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE HAS THE BEARD THAT I'M MISSING. [LAUGHTER] OLD FRIEND. SO IN THE ABSENCE OF BREAKING NEWS, CABLE NEWS CHANNELS RELY ON A VARIETY OF ONE TACTIC, TO HOLD THE VIEWER'S ATTENTION, CONCISE INFORMATIVE REPORTING. [LAUGHTER] IT'S ACTUALLY THIS.
CAN I FINISH --
NO YOU WANTED ME --
YOU ARE LYING.
I'M NOT LYING.
DON'T CALL ME A LIAR.
GO BACK TO 1996.
YES, I AM.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK,
LET ME FINISH.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT AMERICAN -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  NOW NOW NOW GOOD SIMULTANEOUS POINTS EVERYBODY. BUT THAT TOOK SO LONG TO WATCH. CAN WE DISTILL CABLE NEWS DOWN TO ITS CRUNCHY CENTER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  WHEN I SAID LET'S HAVE A BABOON MASTURBATING [LAUGHTER] I DIDN'T THINK WE COULD FIND THAT FOOTAGE. [LAUGHTER] WOW. WE HAVE THE BEST RESEARCH STAFF IN THE COUNTRY. [LAUGHTER] BUT OF COURSE THAT'S JUST 24 HOUR CABLE FILLER. SLOW NEWS DAY CONFLICT CHUM. IT'S WHAT CABLE NEWS CHANNELS DO WHILE WAITING FOR EVENTS THAT TRULY JUSTIFY THEIR EXISTENCE, URGENT SOUL CRUSHING BREAKING NEWS LIKE MASS SHOOTING. THE KIND THAT HAPPENS ALL TOO FREQUENTLY IN THIS PATHOLOGICALLY UNABLE TO TRY AND STOP THEM COUNTRY. IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE WE REQUIRE THE TYPE OF CONTEXT AND CLARITY THAT ONLY THESE NOBLE DORMANT CABLE GIANTS. [LAUGHTER] WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? [LAUGHTER] CAN PROVIDE.
I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE BUT.
I'M SORRY, DID I SAY CONTEXT CLARITY. I MEANT SPECULATION. YES FOR EVERY ALL TOO FAMILIAR AMERICAN TRAGEDY YOU CAN BE SURE THE NEWS WILL EXACERBATE IT WITH YET ANOTHER FORCE FIVE WRONGNADO. GET INSIDE EVERYBODY, GET INSIDE. GET INSIDE AND HOPE FOR A POWER OUTAGE.
IF THERE WERE AS MANY THREE SHOOTERS, THAT WOULD CHANGE THIS SITUATION DRAMATICALLY.
RIGHT NOW NBC NEWS HAS THE REPORT OF JUST ONE SHOOTER. THERE WERE EARLIER REPORTS ABOUT MULTIPLE SHOOTERS. THERE HAS BEEN A NAME THAT'S BEEN REPORTED, BUT WE'RE TOLD THAT THE NAME THAT'S OUT THERE IS INCORRECT BY THE END OF THE RAMPAGE ALEXIS HAD A SHOTGUN, HE HAD A HANDGUN, HE HAD AN AR15.
THERE WERE INITIAL REPORTS FROM AUTHORITIES THAT THE SHOOTER IN THIS CASE USED AN AR15. THAT APPARENTLY NOW IS NOT TRUE.
AGAIN WE'RE SPECULATING HERE BUT THIS IS EXPERIENCED SPECULATION.
OH, YES IT IS. [LAUGHTER]
I'M AN OLD HAND WHEN IT COMES TO SPECULATION, BEEN DOING IT SINCE YOU WERE A GLEAM IN YOUR PAPPY'S EYES. I WAS THE FIRST ONE SUGGESTED JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS KILLED BY SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG. HEEHEE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  DO YOU KNOW FOR SHEER
ACCUMULATION OF BREATHLESSR WRONGNESS, THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE SOURCE THAT MATTERS.
THIS IS CNN. .
A LITTLE BIT OF A BUZZ HERE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. A COUPLE OFFICERS RUSHING DOWN THE STREETS TOWARD THOSE FLASHING LIGHTS. YOU SEE SOME TACTICAL VEHICLES MOVING AROUND HERE. WE SAW AT LEAST FOUR SWAT TEAM MEMBERS WITH HELMETS ON WHAT APPEARED TO BE NIGHT VISION GOGGLES, WE SEE SOME SQUAD CARS AROUND HERE. THIS APPARENTLY IS SOME KIND OF A RESCUE CHOPPER AND WE'VE SEEN KIND OF A RESCUE BASKET OR SOMETHING. THAT'S ABOUT AS LOW AS WE'VE SEEN HIM GO. SO THAT IS KIND OF AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.
Jon:  NO, NO THAT'S NOT AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT. THOSE ARE NOT INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS. YOU'RE JUST STANDING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA NAMING [BLEEP] YOU SEE. IT'S NOT ANYTHING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S LIKE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A FIVE-YEAR-OLD. [LAUGHTER] POLICE CAR. FIRE HYDRANT. FOR SOME REASON CNN THOUGHT TO INCLUDE THEIR SEARCH FOR EVEN THE MOST BANAL OF BACKGROUNDN FACTS.
PAUL, ARE YOU ON THE LINE. LET'S GO TO BARBARA STARR BECAUSE SHE KNOWS ABOUT THIS BUILDING. HOW LARGE IS THIS BUILDING, BARBARA? BARBARA'S ON THE PHONE WITH HER SOURCES GATHERING MORE INFORMATION. MIKE BROOKS DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. HOW LARGE IS THIS BUILDING. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO TO TODD SPERRY, ARE YOU ON THE LINE. TODD SPERRY.
YES, I AM HERE.
TODD, TELL US HOW LARGE THIS BUILDING IS, DO YOU KNOW.
Jon:  CAN SOMEONE TELL HER HOW [BLEEP] THE BUILDING IS. CAN SOMEONE JUST TELL HER HOW [BLEEP] THE BUILDING IS, SOMEONE PLEASE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET TO MOVE FORWARD UNTIL SHE FINDS OUT HOW LARGE THIS BUILDING IS. WE'RE IN SQUARE FOOTAGE  WORMHOLE TERRITORY HERE. AND THEN INEVITABLY   --BLITZER.
THE FACT, TOM, THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL IS DESCRIBED AS SOMEONE DRESSED IN A BLACK TOP, BLACK JEANS WHAT DOES THAT SAY IF ANYTHING ABOUT A POSSIBLE MOTIVE OR WHATEVER. CAN WE BEGIN TO DRAW ANY INITIAL CONCLUSION? [LAUGHTER]
WHAT DOES THE BLACK TOP AND BLACK JEANS SAY ABOUT POSSIBLE MOTIVE. I DON'T KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR BEST COLLEAGUE. [CROWD CHEERING]
PERHAPS THE WORST PART OF THE BLITZER REPORTAGE BESIDES USING PHRASES LIKE. CAN WE BEGIN TO DRAW INITIAL CONCLUSIONS. THAT'S A SEMANTIC WORKAROUND FOR SAYING MAKE [BLEEP] UP. I'M ON UNTIL 4:00. CNN'S BRASH ON AIR ACKNOWLEDGMENT THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS AT ALL.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY IF ANYTHING ABOUT A POSSIBLE MOTIVE OR WHATEVER. CAN WE BEGIN TO DRAW ANY INITIAL CONCLUSIONS. I WANT TO ALERT OUR VIEWERS SOMETIMES THESE INITIAL CONCLUSIONS CAN OBVIOUSLY BE VERY VERY WRONG.
Jon:  YES, YES, CORRECT. THEY CAN BE VERY VERY WRONG. SO DON'T SAY THEM OUT LOUD. IF IT'S AN URGENT SIDE OF YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO GET OUT, HAVE A SPECULATION JAR. [LAUGHTER] [BLEEP] OH MY GOD WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE. [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon:  SOMEONE KEEPS WEED IN THIS. WHO KEEPS WEED IN THIS. SOMEBODY KEEPS WEED IN THIS. MOTHER [BLEEP] REALLY. [APPLAUSE]
Jon:  SPECULATION IS LIKE A COMPULSION.
IF THERE ARE THREE SHOOTERS, WOLF, IF THAT PROVES TO BE CORRECT IT'S GOING TO BE THE MOSTECT SIGNIFICANT FACT. S
THAT'S A STARTLING PIECE OF INFORMATION, IF THAT TURNS OUT TO BE ACCURATE.
THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION HE BELIEVES TO BE ACCURATE HE'S BEEN GIVEN BUT TURNS OUT TO BE INACCURATE.
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS THE INFORMATION THAT IS FLOWING SO QUICKLY IS OFTEN WRONG. AND YOU NOW HAVE SOME INFORMATION FOR US. [LAUGHTER]
I KNOW YOU THINK SAYING THIS COULD ALL BE WRONG MAKES IT OK TO SAY IT. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY. NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS ALLOWED TO OPERATE THAT WAY. HELLO I'M YOUR DOCTOR YOU HAVE CANCER. OF COURSE. OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF MY INITIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY VERY WRONG. THAT BEING SAID, THAT BEING SAID YOU HAVE CANCER. UNLESS YOU DON'T. THESE TEST RESULTS ARE JUST COMING IN HERE SO FAST AND FURIOUS AND I CAN'T WAIT. I'LL KNOW FOR SURE IN AN HOUR IF YOU HAVE CANCER OR NOT BUT [BLEEP] YOU HAVE CANCER, I JUST GOT TO GET IT OUT. AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED, THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED ALL OF YESTERDAY'S CONFUSION IN THE REPORTING IT'S NOT A MISTAKE BECAUSE SADLY THE ONE THING IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY SHOULD HAVE GREAT PRACTICE IN COVERING ARE THESE HORRIFIC SHOOTING TRAGEDIES. AND THERE ARE A TON OF REALLY SMART PEOPLE AND GOOD JOURNALISTS WHO WORK OVER AT CNN. THIS IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS AFTER TTHE CRITICISM OF CNN'S CHAOTIC BOSTON TERRORISM COVERAGE INCLUDING WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED ON AIR AN ARREST THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED. SO MY FINAL NOT INITIAL CONCLUSION IS, THIS IS DELIBERATE. THE CHAOS, THE VOMIT ON TO THE SCREEN, THE VERY THING WE THOUGHT NEWS ORGANIZATIONS WERE CREATED TO CLARIFY IS THE FEATURE, NOT A BUG. HERE'S CNN'S BOSS DESCRIBING THE LESSON THEY LEARNED FROM THE BOSTON COVERAGE.
WE MADE THAT MISTAKE FROM THE BOSTON COVERAGE TWO DAYS LATER AS THE DRAMA UNFOLDED IN BOSTON WE HAD OUR BIGGEST AUDIENCE IN TEN YEARS. DO YOU KNOW WHO GOT IT, UNDERSTOOD WE MADE A MISTAKE AND ACKNOWLEDGED IT? THE AUDIENCE.
OH MY GOD. THE LESSON THEY TAKE IS IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BETRAY OUR TRUST. WE'LL KEEP COMING BACK. WE'RE IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH CNN. IT'S TIME WE KICKED THOSE BASTARDS TO THE CURB BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS NETWORK WAS CREATED BY TED TURNER, NOT IKE TURNER.
