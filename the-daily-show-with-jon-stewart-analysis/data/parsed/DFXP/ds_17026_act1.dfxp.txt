NOVEMBER 29, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD FUSE HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART, TONIGHT, BETTY WHITE. OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE. BETTY WHITE IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. BETTY WHITE, POSSIBLY THE MOST BELOVED ENTERTAINER IN SHOW BUSINESS AND I'M JUST GOING TO  SAY IT. TONIGHT I'M TAKING HER DOWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DROPPING IT LIKE... ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE LATEST REVELATIONS ABOUT HERMAN CAIN IN OUR NEW SEGMENT "  "INDECISION WAVE THE, AFTER DARK." DADDY LIKES THAT LOWER THIRD GRAPHIC. (LAUGHTER) BABY.
ANOTHER WOMAN HAS COME FOG WARD CLAIMING A 13-YEAR AFFAIR.
Jon: CRAP! (LAUGHTER) WELL, WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE SIGN AGAIN, EVERYBODY. (LAUGHTER) YEAH. GOT TO PUT IT BACK TO ZERO. WHO'S THIS LADY?
HER NAME IS GINGER WHITE.
SHE SAYS FOR 13 YEARS HE FLEW HER TO MEET HIM IN HOTELS AND LAVISHED HER WITH GIFTS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL THOSE GIFTS DIDN'T LOOK TOO LAVISH. (LAUGHTER) LET'S FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE. TWO THINGS, ONE, 13 YEARS? THAT IS AN ADMIRABLE COMMITMENT TO THE WOMAN WITH WHOM YOU ARE VIOLATING YOUR SPOUSAL  COMMITMENT WITH. (LAUGHTER) AND, TWO, AFTER ALL THOSE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF UNDERLINGS, NICE  TO SEE HERMAN CAIN GOING THE CONSENSUAL ROUTE. (LAUGHTER) KUDOS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW HE WAS ON THE AIR WITH CNN WHEN IT BROKE.
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'VE KNOWN HER FOR ABOUT THAT PERIOD OF  TIME BUT THE ACCUSATION THAT I HAD A 13-YEAR AFFAIR WITH HER? NO.
THERE WAS NO SEX?
NO.
NONE?
NO. (LAUGHTER)
NEVER BANGED HER.
NO.
(BLEEP)ED HER? DID YOU (BLEEP) HER? (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S MOVE ON TO LIBYA. DID YOU BANG HER? (LAUGHTER) WOW. 13 YEARS, NO SEX. SO EITHER ONE OF THESE TWO PEOPLE IS LYING OR HERMAN CAIN IS THE WORST DEAL CLOSER IN THE  HISTORY OF EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT ALMOST MAKES YOU FEEL SORRY FOR THE GUY.
NO, WOLF, NO SEX. 13 YEARS, LOT OF HOTEL ROOMS, LOT OF GIFTS. (LAUGHTER) NEVER SEALED THE DEAL. JUST... (LAUGHTER). A LOT OF HELLO, THIS IS MR. CAIN IN ROOM 1102, GONNA NEED A COT. (LAUGHTER) AGAIN. BUT CAIN WASN'T WILLING TO SAY THAT THIS WAS THE LAST TIME HE'D BE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING.
DO YOU EXPECT OTHER WOMEN TO BE COMING OUT AND MAKING SIMILAR KIND OF ACCUSATIONS? IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE... NONE.
IS THERE ANY INDICATION THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE.
NONE THAT I KNOW OF! DO I KNOW OF ANY THAT MIGHT COME OUT? NOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. (LAUGHTER)
THIS IS WHERE WOLF BLITZER SHOULD INTERRUPT AND SAY "WE'RE A 24-HOUR NETWORK. TAKE YOUR TIME, DIG A LITTLE DEEPER THAN THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD  HEAD. MAYBE TRY THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HEAD WHERE YOUR BRAIN IS, THE THING THAT STORMS THE NAMES OF  THE LADIES YOU BANG. ONCE AGAIN IT'S BOILING DOWN A HE SAID/THEY SAID SITUATION. ANY EVIDENCE HERE?
WHITE PROVIDED THE FOX AFFILIATE WITH CELL PHONE BILLS AND TEXT MESSAGES SHOWING CAIN  UP UNTIL THIS SEPTEMBER WOULD CONTACT HER AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT-- ONE AT 4:26 A.M.
A 4:26 A.M. BOOTY TEXT? EVEN FARMERS DON'T CHEAT ON THEIR WIVES THAT EARLY. (LAUGHTER) IT'S STILL CIRCUMSTANTIAL. FIG SPHELS.
WHEN HIS NEW BOOK CAME OUT IN 2001, GINGER WHITE SAYS CAIN ONCE AGAIN AUTOGRAPHED IT FOR  HER WRITING "FRIENDS ARE FOREVER, EVERYTHING ELSE IS A BONUS." (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: NO, NO, NO! NO! YOU CALM DOWN! ALL RIGHT. IN HINDSIGHT, YES, SEEMS LIKE FLIRTY INEWEN DOE. BUT IT COULD BE BENIGN. LET'S PULL BACK AND SEE IF HE WROTE ANYTHING ELSE. "BY BONUS, I MEAN MY PENIS." THAT'S SLIGHTLY MORE INCRIMINATING. CAN WE PULL BACK AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING... OKAY. YEAH. HE APPEARS TO HAVE DRAWN A PICTURE OF HIS PENIS. WELL THAT... THAT HAD TO HAVE CREATED QUITE A HOLDUP IN THE AUTOGRAPHED LINE FOR THE BOOK. BUT ONE WHAT COULD BE REASON COULD CAIN HAVE FOR THE GIFTS AND CONTACT WITH THIS WOMAN?
CAIN SAID HE WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP WHITE FINANCIALLY.
Jon: REALLY, JUST TRYING TO HELP HER FINANCIALLY. I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS THE 4:30 A.M. TEXT. "HEY, JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THE MARKETS ARE OPENING IN FIVE HOURS. (LAUGHTER) JUST TEXTING YOU TO TELL YOU TO GET YOUR PORTFOLIO IN ORDER. (LAUGHTER) (BLEEP)'S GONE CRAZY IN EUROPE. FOR MORE ON HERMAN CAIN'S CAMPAIGN ISSUE WE WE HEAD OUT TO WYATT SEINE KNACK. WYATT, HOW BADLY IS THIS GOING TO DAMAGE HIS CREDIBILITY?
THIS IS BAD, SERIOUSLY. DO YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN MARRIED MEN GIVE MONEY TO SINGLE WOMEN THEY'VE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH FOR  13 YEARS BUT HAVEN'T HAD SEX WITH? NEVER. (LAUGHTER) GO AHEAD, TRY IT. THE CHECK WON'T EVEN CLEAR. BANKS AREN'T SET UP FOR THAT. THE A.T.M. SAYS "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU MAN? TRANSACTION DENIED, GO HOME, COME BACK WHEN YOU GET A KISS, DUMMY." (LAUGHTER).
Jon: FIRST SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS, NOW THIS. HE'S GOT TO BE THINKING "WHAT'S NEXT?"
I CAN TELL YOU WHAT'S NEXT. THIS WAS THE SCENE AT THE LOCAL ATLANTA FOX AFFILIATE THAT BROKE THE STORY. (SCREAMING)
HE TOUCHED MY BOOB!
HE TOUCHED MY BREAST!
I ROAD THE CAIN TRAIN!
THEY'RE CALLING IT BLACK WALNUT FRIDAY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH, WYATT, THE SCANDAL HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THE CAIN CAMPAIGN. REPORTS ARE EMERGING HE MIGHT BE CONSIDER WITHDRAWING FROM THE RACE WHICH I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE  HIM FROM DOING. I ALREADY LOST TRUMP. I CAN'T LOSE YOU, TOO. UM... I MEAN, THIS GUY IS THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGG. I'M SORRY, THAT'S ACQUAINTED WITH THE EGG. NEVER LAID IT. NEVER LAID IT. HE'S HELPING THE GOOSE FINANCIALLY WITH THE EGG. BUT IF THESE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL IMPROPRIETY DERAIL CAIN, WHO WILL BENEFIT?
HER MAN CAIN WAS ALREADY LOSING ALTITUDE IN THIS RACE. WHERE DO HIS VOTES GO?
TO NEWT GINGRICH, I THINK. I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT ANTI-ROMNEY VOTE HAS COALESCED ARM AROUND THE FORMER SPEAKER.
Jon: VOTERS LEAF CAIN BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HE HAD AN AFFAIR AND GO TO THE GUY WHO  HAD TWO OF THEM! I GUESS NEWT GINGRICH BECOMES THE CANDIDATE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE HERMAN CAIN BUT THINK HE  WAS TOO MONOGAMOUS. JASON JONES IS SANDING BY. JASON, WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M AT RICK SANTORUM'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. ICKJon:QU NOTE, IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO DIRECTIONS FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS  DO NOT-- AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH-- SEARCH GOOGLE MAPS  MAPS.
Jon: I'M SORRY, I'M JUST WAITING FOR PEOPLE DO THAT AND  COME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. WHAT'S GOING ON AT SANTORUM HEADQUARTERS?
HE'S WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS FROTHING MAD. (LAUGHTER) ABOUT CAIN VOTERS GOING TO GINGRICH.
Jon: WHAT WHY IS HE MAD?
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO DO TO GET RESPECT? HIS CREDENTIALS ARE UNMATCHED. HE'S PRO-LIFE, ANTI-IMMIGRANT, STRICT CREATIONIST, HE EQUATES SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WITH GET TO GOAT (BLEEP)ING. HE BLAMED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S SEX SCANDAL ON LIBERALISM. FOR GOD'S SAKE, HE HAS SEVEN CHILDREN BUT HAD ONLY HAD SEX FOUR TIMES! (LAUGHTER) HE'S A POSTER BOY FOR THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT BUT HE NEVER GETS ANY ATTENTION. HE'S GOT A...
Jon: I'M SORRY. SAMANTHA BEE, WHERE ARE YOU?
JOHN, I'M IN ROOM 307 OF THE FOUR SEASONS IN HILLS DALE, MICHIGAN AND I CAN NOW TELL YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY WHERE THE NEXT CAIN BOMBSHELL WILL  COME FROM. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHERE, SAM?
JON, AS GOD IS MY WITNESS, I AM TELLING YOU NOW THAT HERMAN CAIN IS UNDERNEATH MY SKIRT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: HERMAN CAIN IS THERE RIGHT NOW?
LET ME CONFIRM THAT WITH MY SOURCES. YEAH, THAT'S GOING TO BE A 10464.
Jon: SAM, THIS IS IT! THIS IS DIRECT EVIDENCE OF IMPROPRIETY.
NOT ACCORDING TO HERMAN CAIN, JON. HE AS ISSUED A STATEMENT ADMITTING HE KNOWS ME AND IS, IN FACT, UNDER MY SKIRT BUT HE SAYS  HE'S JUST PROVIDING MUCH-NEEDED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MY VAGINA. (LAUGHTER) AS A FRIEND. JUST AS FRIENDS.
Jon: CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?
I CAN CONFIRM HERMAN CAIN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE TERM "FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE."  QUIT IT! HERMAN, YOU ARE BAD!
