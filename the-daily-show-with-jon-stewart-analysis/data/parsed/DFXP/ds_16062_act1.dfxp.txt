MAY 10, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A NICE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THANKS FOR JOINING US. TONIGHT ON THE PROGRAM WE HAVE A YOUNG COMEDIC ACTOR, WILLIS FERRELL. (LAUGHTER) YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S GOING TO BE JOINING US, I HEAR GREAT THINGS. REALLY EXCITED TO MEET HIM. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE SOUTH. OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THOSE ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI WHO ARE SUFFERING NOT JUST FROM A  CATASTROPHIC FLOOD OF WATER BUT ALSO FROM A MONSOON OF MEDIA ONE UPMANSHIP. (LAUGHTER) THE DEBILITATING COVERAGE BEGAN AS THE WATERS ROSE UP TO SWALLOW  ONE REPORTER'S FEET, CREEPING UP TO THE KNEE, MOVING SLOWLY UP TO  THE THIGH, CONSUMING THE HIPS AND FINALLY, THANK GOD, CRESTING AT THE NIPPLE! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) THE WATER CRESTED AT THE NIPPLE. (LAUGHTER) ALL THESE REPORTERS BRAVELY WADED INTO THE SURGING MISSISSIPPI TO GIVE US  ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW HIGH THE FLOODWATERS WERE OR THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE. YOU KNOW, GUYS, I'M GLAD YOU'RE DOWN THING THERE BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE STORY BUT YOU  COULD HAVE DONE THE EXACT SAME STORIES ON DRY LAND WITHOUT EVER GOING IN... (LAUGHTER). WAIT A MINUTE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO. YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A NEW MEASURE OF FLOOD HEIGHT MEASUREMENTS. (LAUGHTER) A WEATHERMAN-BASED SYSTEM.
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE, WE HERE IN THE MISSISSIPPI. THIS IS A PLAYGROUND.
Jon: (AS OLD MAN) I REMEMBER THE FLOOD OF AUGHT 11 LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. THAT WATER WAS FOUR ROKER BELLIES HIGH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GET A TOWEL. (LAUGHTER) MEANWHILE, THE BATTLE TO CAPTURE AND KILL BIN LADEN HAS ENDED BUT  THE GENERATIONAL WAR TO CLAIM CREDIT RAGES ON. PRESIDENT OBAMA FIRED THE FIRST SHOT BY SENDING THE NAVY SEALS INTO PAKISTAN TO FIRE THE... FIRST ACTUAL SHOT. (LAUGHTER) GIVING THE PRESIDENT SOMEWHAT OF A LEG UP CREDIT WISE. BUT IT WAS OBAMA'S POST-OPERATION GROUND ZERO 9/11 FAMILIES NAVY SEALS MEET AND  GREETS THAT ESCALATED THE HOSTILITY.
FORMER BUSH CHIEF OF STAFF ANDY CARD SAID "I THINK OBAMA'S  POUNDED HIS CHEST A LITTLE TOO MUCH. HE CAN TAKE PRIDE IN IT, BUT HE DOES NOT NEED TO SHOW IT SO MUCH."
Jon: AND YOU CAN BET YOUR SWEET-- BIPPY-- (LAUGHTER) THAT THE GUY WHO WAS PRESIDENT  BUSH'S CHIEF OF STAFF DURING HIS TOP GUN INSPIRED CROTCH-ENHANCED  AIRCRAFT CARRIER LANDING THAT TOOK CREDIT FOR ENDING A WAR WE'RE STILL FIGHTING EIGHT  (BLEEP)ING YEARS LATER... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IS GOING TO LET BARACK OBAMA GET AWAY WITH IT. BY THE WAY, THE ONLY REASON BUSH DIDN'T LITERALLY POUND HIS CHEST  ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WAS THAT THAT WOULD HAVE RELEASED AN EMERGENCY PARACHUTE AND SWEPT  HIM OUT TO SEA. (LAUGHTER) SO THIS PAST WEEK WHEN, BY ALL RIGHTS, OBAMA AND HIS TEAM COULD  HAVE STRUTTED THEIR STUFF ALL OVER THE NEWS SHOWS ON THE WEEKEND, ANDY CARD AND COMPANY  WENT INTO ACTION OF COURSE, TO FEEL THIS MUCH GLORY THEY'D HAVE TO REASSEMBLE THE WHOLE TEAM--  THE BEST OF THE BEST. (LAUGHTER) THE ARCHITECT! OH, YEAH! THE POSSUM! (LAUGHTER) DR. HENNEY PENNY. (LAUGHTER) THE... DON CHEADLE CHARACTER LADY. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN, I GUESS, THERE'S PROBABLY, LIKE, SEVEN OTHERS  THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE UP NICKNAMES FOR. BUT MOVE OUT, EVERYONE, SHOCK AND AWE TIME!
THERE WERE SEVEN IMPORTANT POLICY DECISIONS MADE UNDER BUSH  THAT MADE SUNDAY NIGHT POSSIBLE.
THE POLICIES ON INTERROGATION AND WIRETAPPING.
WHAT WE CALLED ENHANCED INTERROGATION.
WE INCREASED THE NUMBERS IN THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
THE POLICY OF RENDITION. THE.
CONCEPT THAT THE TERRORISM PROBLEM HAS TO BE DEALT WITH AS A WAR.
TREATING THESE PEOPLE AS ENEMY COMBATANTS NOT AS CRIMINALS.
THE CAPACITY OF OUR MILITARY AND OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO FIGHT IN THIS INTEGRATED FASHION.
MILITARY TRIBUNALS, HAVING MILITARY TRIBUNALS IN PLACE.
UNFAILING, CONSTANT VIGILANCE ABOUT PROTECTING AMERICA.
PRESIDENT BUSH HAD TO MAKE SOME VERY, VERY HARD CALLS THAT, FRANKLY, HELPED TO SET THIS UP.
Jon: HE INVENTED BULLETS. (LAUGHTER) THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO TRICK BIN LADEN WITH A FAKE  SWEEPSTAKES GIVE AWAY TO LURE HIM OUT OF HIDING. WHEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAID "WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT HIM HERE?" (LAUGHTER)  ELEVEN BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS FOUGHT TO BE IN THEIR LAST THROES CAME OUT OF THEIR  HIDY HOLES AND SHOOK BACK WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE. BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS READY FIRING BACK WITH NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TOM DONILON ON  "MEET THE PRESS" AND NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TOM DONILON ON CNN. AND HE WAS ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY AND THE SAME GUY ON "THIS WEEK"  REQUEST W CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR. ONE GUY. (LAUGHTER) BUSH ADMINISTRATION HITS THEM WITH SHOCK AND AWE AND YOU'VE  GOT ONE GUY-- NO ONE'S EVER HEARD OF. THIS GUY BETTER BE RAMBO.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT FOR YOUR VIEWERS AND AMERICANS GENERALLY TO UNDERSTAND. THIS WAS AN EFFORT ACROSS TWO ADMINISTRATIONS. INDEED, MANY OF THE SAME PROFESSIONALS WHO WORKED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH ON THIS PROJECT  WORK WITH US TODAY. SO IT IS NOT A MATTER OF PARTISANSHIP.
Jon: (WHISPERING) WHAT ARE YOU DOING? (LAUGHTER) WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THOSE GUY'S SUCKED IN? THIS SHOWS WE CAN ACCOMPLISH OUR GOALS WITHOUT WAGING REGIME CHANGE WAR ON OTHER COUNTRIES. IT SHOWS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MONDAY MORNING WATERBOARDERS THAT INTELLIGENCE CAN BE  DEVELOPED THROUGH MORE TRADITIONAL LESS SOUL CORRODING MEANS. JESUS, DEMOCRATS! YOU CAN'T ENGAGE THE REPUBLICANS ON THEIR TERMS-- THE BLAME GAME-- ENDS UP WITH OBAMA AND  THE CREDIT GAME, WELL, (BLEEP), WE ALL KNOW WHERE THAT'S GOING.
I THINK CREDIT GOES OVER THREE GENERATIONS... THREE PRESIDENCIES.
PRESIDENT CLINTON EVEN BEFORE 9/11 MADE OSAMA BIN LADEN PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SEEMS TO DO WELL WHEN HE DOES WHAT YOUR FATHER DID.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WHEN MY FATHER WENT INTO GRENADA HE DIDN'T TELL THE WORLD HE WAS  GOING INTO GRENADA, HE DID IT.
Jon: THEY TOOK IT BACK TO REAGAN! (LAUGHTER) THE GUY RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING THE TALIBAN IN THE FIRST PLACE! HOW DO YOU TAKE THIS... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I GUESS... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE WHOLE THING'S MIND-BOGGLING. WHY ARE WE LISTENING TO THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PEOPLE ANYWAY? THEY DIDN'T GET BIN LADEN. THEY'RE LIKE THE WINKLEVOSS TWINS OF GETTING BIN LADEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF YOU WERE THE GUYS WHO WERE GOING TO KILL BIN LADEN, YOU  WOULD HAVE KILLED BIN LADEN. AND THE WORST PART ABOUT HEARING ONCE AGAIN FROM ALL THE OLD ADMINISTRATION HANDS?
I HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH A LOT OF THE SEALS AND SEAL TEAM SIX (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: IT MADE MER THAT FIRST UNCOOL THING I'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT SEAL TEAM SIX. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
