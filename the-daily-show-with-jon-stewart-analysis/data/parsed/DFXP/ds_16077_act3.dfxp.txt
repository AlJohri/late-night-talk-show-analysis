Jon: TONIGHT, A PRODUCER, DIRECTOR, WRITER OF A FILM CALLED "SUPER 8."
OH, MY GOD!
Jon: I'LL TELL YOU, AMTRAK HAS IMPROVED BUT... (LAUGHTER) PLEASE WELCOME J.J. ABRAMS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS, THE NUMBER ONE FILM NOT JUST IN THIS GREAT NATION OF OURS BUT IN THE  ENTIRE OF THE AMERICAS AS WELL AS... I'M GOING TOO GO WITH INDONESIA. (LAUGHTER) AND PARTS OF BRAZIL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S....
Jon: VERY EXCITING.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: IS IT DIFFICULT? WE DO THIS SHOW EVERYDAY AND SOME DAYS IT CAN SUCK. (LAUGHTER) BUT WHEN IT DOES, WE COME BACK IN THE NEXT DAY AND WE DO IT AGAIN. A FILM YOU INVESTED... HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU PUT INTO MAKING JUST THIS FILM "SUPER 8"?
THE MOVIE TOOK ABOUT A YEAR OR SO FROM THE IDEA TO ACTUALLY START SHOOTING AND THEN WE  STARTED SHOOTING LAST SEPTEMBER SO IT WAS A VERY QUICK....
Jon: FOR FILM MAKING THAT'S AWFULLY QUICK.
IT WAS A QUICK PRODUCTION AND POST-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE. INSANELY TIGHT POST-PRODUCTION SCHEDULE.
Jon: EVEN WITHIN THAT, HOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR-TO-LAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT AND WAIT  FOR THAT ONE WEEKEND. WHAT DO YOU DO ON THAT ONE WEEKEND WHEN ALL THIS EFFORT AND ENERGY AND WRITING GOES INTO THE OPENING?
YOU'RE A NERVOUS WRECK BECAUSE THE IDEA THAT IT'S  THROUGHOUT... IT'S A WEIRD THING. POST-PRODUCTION IS LIKE EIGHT PEOPLE. THE EDITORS, THE ASSISTANCE EDITORS. YOU'RE ALL JUST WORKING TOGETHER FOR MONTHS IN THIS CAVE AND THEN  IN AN INSTANT IT'S JUST OUT THERE AND YOU'RE MEETING  STRANGERS AND YOU'RE LIKE "YOU KNOW THAT SCENE LIKE HOW DO YOU  KNOW..." SUDDEN IT'S NOT JUST THE EIGHT OF YOU.
Jon: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT NOT BEING IN A CAVE? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE... AND, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW... (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW HOLLYWOOD AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS WORK OUT  THERE, BUT A MAN OF YOUR... YOU COULD DO THIS FROM A GROTTO. (LAUGHTER)
NEXT TIME I'LL TRY NOT EDITING IN THE CAVE.
Jon: DO PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY CAN SPEAK TO YOU LIKE THAT? PEOPLE JUST COME UP ON THE STREET AND THEY'RE LIKE "THAT ONE SCENE. I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT." LIKE THAT KIND OF?
NO, I THINK WHAT HAPPENS....
Jon:
YOU TOO, NEW YEAH.
NO, I THINK THAT... I THINK... MY DAD LIKED THE MOVIE. I THINK IT'S HARD SOMETIMES BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST DON'T TELL  YOU THE TRUTH AND THEY'LL, OF COURSE, SAY THINGS, OH, THAT WAS GREAT AND YOU KIND OF SEE THE  SHALLOWNESS LIKE, UM... SO THE KEY IS FINDING PEOPLE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MY WIFE, WHO WILL  JUST KICK YOUR ASS IF SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT AND JUST BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU BECAUSE THEN  WHEN THEY LOVE IT AND THEY SAY "I LOVE IT" YOU KNOW IT'S REAL.
Jon: AND IT MEANS SOMETHING.
IT MEANS SOMETHING.
Jon: CAN I HAVE YOUR WIFE? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE...
NO, MY WIFE IS CRITICAL.
Jon: YOU TRUST THEIR OPINION BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY TO YOU WOW, THAT WAS TERRIBLE. THANK YOU. HOW DO YOU WORK? DO YOU WORK BACKWARDS? DO YOU KNOW... YOUR MOVIES AND YOUR TELEVISION SHOWS ARE SO LAYERED AND THERE'S SO MUCH  GOING ON. DO YOU START WITH THE DESTINATION AND WORK YOUR WAY BACK OR...
IT ALL DEPENDS. OBVIOUSLY T.V. IS LINEAR NARRATIVE DRAMA SHOWS ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND DOING A MOVIE  BECAUSE IT'S BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND END OF A MOVIE (A T.V. SHOW IT'S ALWAYS A LEAP OF FAITH. ALWAYS. YOU HAVE BIG IDEAS, YOU GO "I THINK I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING."  SO WHEN I WROTE THE PILOT FOR "LOST" WE LAD A TON OF BIG IDEAS BUT THERE WERE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERS. LIKE IF EVERYONE KNOW IT IS SHOW VEN, BLINDNESS WASN'T IN THE PILOT. AND DAMON AND CARLSON WHO RAN "LOST", THOSE GUYS CAME UP WITH EVERYTHING. I WENT OFF AND DID A MOVIE. THOSE GUYS WERE BUSTING THEIR ASS ON THAT SHOW FOR SIX YEARS. SO MY POINT IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE IDEAS BUT IT'S LIKE DRIVING IN THE FOG. YOU SORT OF... THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE DESTINATION THE MORE DETAIL YOU SEE, THE WHO ARE M  YOU REALIZE LET'S TAKE THIS ROAD. SO IT EVOLVES AS YOU GO.
Jon: SO IN THAT FOG AS YOU'RE PULLING UP CLOSER AND THE FOG  CLEARS AND YOU GO "OH, MY GOD, KERI RUSSELL CUT HER HAIR!" (LAUGHTER)
UNBELIEVABLE, HUH?
Jon: THE CREATIVE SYNERGY OF THAT, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TRUST THAT COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT COMPLEX HAND IT OVER AND SAY "I TRUST THAT YOU WILL TAKE THIS."  ESPECIALLY WITH SCIENCE FICTION WHICH HAS SO MANY BOUNDARIES AND RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT OCCUR  WITHIN THE UNIVERSES THAT YOU CREATE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT THE THING IS....
Jon: SO YES ON THE SHOW I SAID THE THAT JEWISH PUBIC HAIR WAS SIMILAR TO THE PLANET ENDOR. AND I GOT A LETTER SAYING ENDOR'S A MOON, YOU KNOW? OH, DID I SAY PLANET? SORRY. PEOPLE ARE GOING PORE OVER IT.
BUT IN TELEVISION WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS PEOPLE  START TO FIND CONNECTIONS THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED. SO IT'S A WEIRD THING. YOU'LL START TO HAVE AN IDEA AND YOU'LL START TO DO SOMETHING. FOR ME IT WAS "ALIENS." ... "ALIAS." IT WAS UNBELIEVEIBLE THE  CONNECTIONS PEOPLE WERE MAKING TO THINGS WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WERE CONNECTIONS TO. SO WE WOULD DECIDE SOMETIMES TO FOLLOW SOMETHING AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY "OH, I READ THAT  ONLINE." WHAT? AND THEY WOULD SHOW ME THIS THING WHERE SOMEONE HAD ALREADY MADE A CONNECTION. SO IT'S THIS WEIRD THING WHERE WHEN YOU'RE DOING A SHOW YOU  HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT AS MUCH AS IT LISTENS TO YOU. BUT THE VIEWERS SO SMART AND SOME HAVE A LOT OF TIME. (LAUGHTER) AND THELT LITERALLY EXTRAPOLATE BASED ON WHERE YOU ARE "OH, THEY  MUST BE RELATED." SO YOU'RE IN THE WRITERS ROOM  AND THEY'RE LIKE "WHAT IF IT'S HER FATHER?" AND SOMEONE ELSE IS LIKE "YOU  MEAN LIKE ALIAS FAN 7 WROTE?"
Jon: AND YOU HOPE THEY'RE BRILLIANT.
THANK YOU ALIAS FAN 7:.
Jon: WELL SO NICE TO SEE YOU. SO NICE TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. GREAT WORK. "SUPER 8 IS" IS IN THE
