Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW JENNIFER ANISTON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING?
AS ALWAYS. NOTHING. I'M JUST SORT OF STROLLING AROUND NEW YORK CITY.
Jon: PROMOTING SOME MOVIES.
SELL AGO MOVIE.
Jon: PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOUR CHARACTER IS A LITTLE MORE RAUNCHY, A LITTLE HARDER EDGE, A BIT OF A DEPARTURE. CLEARLY THEY DID NOT SEE MARLEE AND ME.
ESPECIALLY ON THE....
Jon: BECAUSE YOU IN THAT....
IT WAS CRAZY.
Jon: VICIOUS.
THERE WAS A LOT OF EDITING ROOM FLOOR THAT THEY COULD NOT PUT IN.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
RAUNCHY.
Jon: IN THIS THING, IT'S ABOUT A DENTIST THAT IS SEXUALLY HARASSING HER EMPLOYEES. IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF YOUR EMPLOYEES, IS THAT FROWNED UPON NOW BECAUSE....
WHY?
Jon: I ALSO HAVE ONE OF THOSE DENTIST SQUIRTERS IN MY OFFICE. WHENEVER ANYBODY COMES IN.
MALE OR FEMALE?
Jon: IT REALLY IS JUST JEWISH OR CHRISTIAN. SEE WHICH IS WHICH.
THAT'S INTERESTING. WHAT OTHER DENT MANY TOOLS DO YOU HAVE.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING, I AM STILL AT THIS AGE NOT A BIG FAN OF GOING TO  THE DENTIST.
NOBODY IS.
Jon: THEY'VE GOTTEN MUCH BETTER. MY KIDS DON'T HAVE THE SAME HANG-UP ABOUT IT AS I DO.
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHAT ARE THEY DOING DIFFERENTLY THESE DAYS.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THEY'RE BANGING WHILE MY KIDS ARE OUT? THAT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. JUST OPENING UP A HIGHLIGHTS MAGAZINE AND GOING TO TOWN.
MY DENTIST PLAYS THE GUITAR FOR ME WHEN I'M... WHEN I HAVE LIKE MOLDS IN MY MOUTH. LITERALLY WHILE SOMETHING IS... I MEAN IT'S ODD. BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
Jon: WHY DOESN'T HE DO LIKE DENTAL (BEEP) WHILE YOU'RE... WHY IS HE PLAYING....
DON'T ASK. IT'S HOLLYWOOD.
Jon: HE PUTS ALL THAT STUFF IN YOUR MOUTH AND GOES, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A NEW CD?
I'M NOT KIDDING. HE PLAYS... AND YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE CHAIR SO YOU'RE SORT OF STUCK LISTENING TO IT. NOT THAT IT'S NOT GOOD OR ANYTHING BY THE WAY.
Jon: THE IMPORTANT THING....
LOVELY.
Jon: INFLAME YOUR DENTIST THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN THE CHAIR. IS HE PLAYING DENTIST MUSIC LIKE A CERTAIN....
HE'S PLAYING MUSIC HE'S LEARNED. HE LITERALLY LEARNED TO PLAY THE GUITAR LIKE SEVEN YEARS AGO WHICH I'VE BEEN GOING TO  HIM FOR 15 YEARS. IT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE. HE'S REALLY GOOD.
Jon: SO ONE DAY... AND I HATE TO STICK TO THIS BUT ONE DAY HE SAID JENNIFER I HAVE A  SURPRISE FOR YOU.
YES.
Jon: AND HE PULLED OUT A GUITAR. WERE YOU NERVOUS THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROPOSE? DID YOU THINK, GUITAR?
NO, I DIDN'T THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PICTURES OF THE FAMILY UP ON  THE WALL AND ALL OF THEIR TEETH.
Jon: HOW IS A DENTIST KIDS' TEETH?
GORGEOUS.
Jon: WOULD HAVE TO BE. DO YOU THINK... AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO DISRESPECT THIS GUY. DO YOU THINK IT'S HIS REAL FAMILY? BECAUSE JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM A PURELY FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, LET'S SAY THESE  ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH SOME TRULY (BEEP) DENTAL WORK. HE CAN'T PUT THEM UP. I MEAN, I'M NOT IN ANY WAY SUGGESTING....
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU THINK MY DENTIST IS SORT OF CORRUPT? KIND OF?
Jon: SOMEHOW FIGURED OUT THAT HE'S USING DENTAL WORK AS A STEPPING STONE TO A MUSIC CAREER.
IT'S A HOBBY. I DON'T THINK HE'S... HE'S NOT... THERE'S NO MUSIC....
Jon: I LIKE TO DO WOODWORKING.
YOU DO.
Jon: I LIKE TO DO WOODWORKING.
YOU WHITTLE?
Jon: I WHITTLE. IS THAT WHAT THE KIDS ARE CALLING IT THESE DAYS?
THAT'S WHAT I USED TO CALL IT.
Jon: LET'S SAY, JENNIFER, HOLD ON A SECOND AND I GOT LET'S SAY A TABLE SAW AND I JUST STARTED MOIKING YOU A CABINET.
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YES.
Jon: YOU KNOW I MADE MY CHILDREN'S CHANGING TABLE.
YOU DID.
Jon: I FIGURED AT THAT AGE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REMEMBER THE SPLINTERS.
NO.
Jon: BUT I DID MAKE IT. IT WAS QUITE GOOD.
I BET IT WAS.
Jon: VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY THAT. IT'S A VERY FUNNY MOVIE. IT'S IN THE THEATERS ON JULY 8.
