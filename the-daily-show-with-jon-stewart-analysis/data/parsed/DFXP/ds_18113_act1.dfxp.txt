JUNE 10, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER, AND LET'S ALL  JUST ACKNOWLEDGE FOR A MOMENT  THAT THIS IS WEIRD. THIS LOOKS WEIRD. IT FEELS WEIRD. IT EVEN SOUNDS WEIRD. IT SOUNDS WEIRD TO ME, AND THIS  IS MY ACTUAL VOICE. LOOK, IF YOU HADN'T HEARD BY  NOW, JON STEWART IS GOING TO BE  AWAY FOR THE SUMMER. HE'S GONE TO A SMALL ITALIAN  VILLAGE TO LEARN HOW TO COBBLE  SHOES. BUT MY GUEST TONIGHT IS GOING TO  BE SETH ROGEN. SETH ROGEN IS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND I LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLAINING  TO HIM EXACTLY WHO THE [BLEEP] I  AM. THAT'S ABOUT 30% A JOKE. BEFORE JON LEFT, HE WAS VERY  SWEET. HE WAS VERY WARM AND SUPPORTIVE. HE ACTUALLY GAVE ME THIS LITTLE  NOTE HERE. HE SAID, DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL BE GREAT. THAT'S NICE. ALTHOUGH SUBJECTIVE. BESIDES, NO BIG NEWS STORIES  EVERY BREAK OUT OVER THE SUMMER.
U.S. OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE  SECRETLY COLLECTING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS' PHONE RECORDS ON A  DAILY BASIS.
PRIVATE CALLS OF AMERICANS,  WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN SUSPECTED  OF A CRIME OR NOT.
ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME? JON'S BEEN GONE ONE DAY. ONE DAY. WE HAD SUCH A FUN, GENTLE FIRST  SHOW PLANNED FOR YOU. YOU KNOW, A FEW HARMLESS  UNBRITISH JOKES LIKE, OH, THIS  IS A FOOTBALL, NOT A SOCCER  BALL. WE CALL IT A FOOTBALL. HALFWAY THROUGH THE SHOW WE WERE  GOING TO BREAK AND HAVE A LITTLE  TEA TIME. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE SHOW  I WASN'T GOING ON FLY OFF WITH  AN UMBRELLA. IT WAS JUST A BIT OF FUN. JUST A BIT OF SUMMER FUN. AND INSTEAD JON STEWART IS  BARELY OUT OF THE DOOR AND IT  TURNS OUT THAT NOT ONLY IS THE GOVERNMENT TRACKING EVERYONE'S  PHONE CALLS BUT THAT'S JUST THE  TIP OF THE [BLEEP]BERG.
IT GOES WAY BEYOND PHONE  RECORDS TO OUR INTERNET HABITS  AND WHO WE EMAIL WITH.
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY  IS BUILDING THIS MASSIVE NEW  DATA CENTER IN UTAH.
THIS IS A MAMMOTH FACILITY. THE PUBLISHED REPORTS INDICATE  THAT IT CAN HOLD FIVE ZETA-BYTES  OF DATA.
ZETA BYTES? THEY'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH  THOSE. I THINK THAT'S HOW MICHAEL  DOUGLAS GOT THROAT CANCER. BOOM! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HEY, HEY, HE LEFT YOU. JON LEFT YOU. I'M HERE. SO, IT TURNS OUT THE GOVERNMENT  IS MONITORING VASTLY MORE  INFORMATION THAN EVEN GEORGE ORWELL WET THE BED OVER, WHICH  BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT.
READ THE TIME OFF YOUR [BLEEP] WRIST WATCH.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU WON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST. THE GOOD NEWS... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] GOOD NEWS YOU'RE NOT PARANOID IS  BROUGHT TO YOU BY TIN FOIL. WHY NOT WEAR IT AS A HAT? OKAY. SO, THE GOVERNMENT HAS BUILT A  GIANT COMPUTER THAT BASICALLY  RECORDS EVERY FACET OF OUR DAILY  LIFE. WHAT IS THIS SINISTER PROGRAM  CALLED, RAIN FORESHADOW BLADE,  THE HUMAN SNOOP-IPEDE.
THE INTERNET SURVEILLANCE  PROGRAM IS CALLED PRISM.
PRISM? THAT'S THE BEST YOU'VE GOT? WITH A LOGO THAT LOOKS LIKE A  CHINESE BOOT LEG OF A PINK FLOYD  ALBUM? OH, THANKS VERY MUCH, MOM. THIS IS JUST WHAT I WANTED. I HEAR IT SYNCS UP PERFECTLY TO  THE DVD OF THE WIZARD OF OZ THAT  YOU ALSO GOT ME. SO IF IS THIS A SECRET  PROGRAM -- AND THIS MIGHT SEEM  LIKE A RELATIVELY STUPID  QUESTION BUT -- HOW ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT?
EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS JUST TAKEN  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE OF THE  BIGGEST GOVERNMENT LEAKS IN U.S. HISTORY.
I SITTING AT MY DESK  CERTAINLY HAD THE AUTHORITY TO  WIRE TAP ANYONE FROM YOU OR YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A FEDERAL JUDGE TO  EVEN A PRESIDENT IF I HAD A  PERSONAL EMAIL.
FANTASTIC. THAT'S BASICALLY EVERY  CONVERSATION I'VE EVER HAD WITH  AN I.T. GUY. OKAY. OKAY, YOU CAN HACK INTO THE  PRESIDENT'S EMAIL ACCOUNT. IN THE MEANTIME, CAN YOU JUST  GET [BLEEP] EXCEL TO WORK? I HAVE A PRESENTATION IN HALF AN  HOUR. THANKS TO A RESPECTABLE WHISTLE  BLOWER WE NOW KNOW THAT THE  GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ACTIVELY COLLECTING AN UNPRECEDENTED  AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ON A SMALL  ELECT GROUP OF US WHO EITHER MAKE PHONE CALLS OR USE THE  INTERNET. I'M GOING TO SAY I'LL BET THE  AMISH ARE FEELING PRETTY [BLEEP] SMUG RIGHT NOW. OR THEY WOULD BE FEELING THAT  WAY IF THEY HAD ANY IDEA THAT  THIS STORY WAS HAPPENING. THE QUESTION NOW IS CAN WE TRUST  THE PEOPLE WHO WE'VE TRUSTED  WITH OUR INFORMATION? FORTUNATELY JUST THREE MONTHS  AGO THE SENATE HELD A HEARING  WITH DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER. IN HINDSIGHT, HE GAVE US A TRULY  INTERESTING WINDOW INTO HIS  TRUSTWORTHINESS.
SO WHAT I WANTED TO SEE IF  YOU COULD GIVE ME A YES-OR-NO  ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: DOES THE N.S.A. COLLECT ANY TYPE OF DATA  AT ALL ON MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS  OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS?
NO, SIR. IT DOES NOT? NOT WITTINGLY.  SPY SHOULD HAVE THAT BIG A  TAIL. I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE NORMANDY  LANDINGS ARE. IS IT HOT IN HERE OR AM I JUST  LYING? HERE'S HOW MUCH THIS GUY WAS  RUBBING HIS FOREHEAD. THIS IS HIM AT THE START OF THE  HEARING. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS'  HAIR. NOW THERE ARE SOME SYSTEMS  ALREADY IN PLACE, THANKFULLY, TO  PROTECT US FROM ALL OF THIS. IT WOULD, FOR INSTANCE, BE  ILLEGAL FOR THE N.S.A. TO  DIRECTLY TARGET AMERICANS. FOREIGNERS, HOWEVER, SURE. FOR NATIONAL SECURITY THAT'S  FAIR GAME. THE PROBLEM IS HOW CAN YOU TELL  ACCURATELY BETWEEN AN AMERICAN  AND A FOREIGNER? I GUESS YOU COULD ASK, DO YOU  WANT TO WALK OR DRIVE? BUT I'M SURE THAT THE N.S.A.... YOU DRIVE. YOU KNOW YOU DRIVE. YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT  AS A QUESTION. BUT RELAX. I'M SURE THE N.S.A. HAS A MORE  SCIENTIFICALLY PRECISE METHOD OF  DISCERNING BETWEEN THOSE TWO OPTIONS THAN THAT.
ANALYST WHO USED THE SYSTEM  FOR A WEB PORTAL AT FORT MEED  KEY IN SCHRECKORS OR SEARCH TERMS TO ARE DESIGNED TO PRODUCE  AT LEAST 51% CONFIDENCE IN A  TARGET'S FOREIGNNESS.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. 51%? THAT IS A PRETTY [BLEEP] HUGE  MARGIN OF ERROR. THAT'S BASICALLY FLIPPING A COIN  PLUS ONE PERCENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] PLEASE! TELL ME THAT WE HAVE RETAINED AT  LEAST AN EXTERNAL CHECK ON THE  N.S.A.
THE FISA COURT, THE  INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT,  HAS TO APPROVE ANY TIME N.S.A. SEEKS TO PULL SPECIFIC  INFORMATION OUT OF THIS  DATABASE.
LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE  GOVERNMENT ASKED THE COURT 1,789  TIMES FOR AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE. THE COURT DID NOT DENY ANY OF  THE SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS.
SO THEY NEVER SAY NO. IT'S BASICALLY AMERICAN IDOL  WITH FOUR RANDY JACKSONS. WE'VE ESSENTIALLY GOT NOTHING TO  HOLD THE GOVERNMENT BACK  STRONGER THAN A RUBBER-STAMPED  COURT.
THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF  SAFEGUARDS INVOLVED. CONGRESS IS CONTINUALLY BRIEFED  ON HOW THESE ARE CONDUCTED.
THAT'S LOVELY. SO NOW INSTEAD OF BEING SPIED ON  BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IT  TURNS OUT WE'RE BEING SPIED ON BY ALL THE BRANCHES. I THINK YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING  THE PERCEIVED PROBLEM HERE,  MR. PRESIDENT. NO ONE IS SAYING THAT YOU BROKE  ANY LAWS. WE'RE JUST SAYING IT'S A LITTLE  BIT WEIRD THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE  TO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
