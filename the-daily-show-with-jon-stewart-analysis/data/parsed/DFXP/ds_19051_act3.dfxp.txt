Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT THE WEEKEND ANCHOR OF PBS NEWSHOUR. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM HARI SREENIVASEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO. â™ª  FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU ARE NOW, YOU WERE REPORTING FOR NEWSHOUR DURING THE WEEK AND NOW YOU ARE THE WEEKEND ANCHOR.
YES, IT'S A HALF HOUR SHOW BUT IT'S STILL CALLED THE NEWSHOUR. TWO HALF HOURS MAKE AN HOUR, SO YEAH.
Jon: I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ] I WATCH PBS. LISTEN TO ME, YOU DO LONG FORM REPORTING --
YEAH.
Jon: NOT SENSATIONALIZED. THE STORIES ARE WELL THOUGHT OUT. THEY ARE NOT FOCUSED ON CONFLICT. THEY ARE FOCUSED ON ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION. IS THAT WHY YOU NEED OUTSIDE MONEY TO KEEP GOING?
IT'S THE LAST PLACE ON TV WHERE YOU CAN FIND INTELLIGENT INFORMED PEOPLE DISAGREE AGREEABLY ABOUT MATTERS THAT MATTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. SO, AS YOUR LAST SEGMENT POINTED OUT, WE TOTALLY MISSED TWERKING. WE JUST DIDN'T COVER MILEY CYRUS NEARLY ENOUGH AND WE MIGHT GET AN AWARD FOR THAT.
Jon: IF IT COMES BACK AROUND, YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN. I THINK IT WILL. [LAUGHTER] FOR YOU, IS IT SURPRISING TO WATCH-- DO YOU WATCH OTHER NEWS PROGRAMS?
YES.
Jon: DO YOU WATCH THE 24 HOUR NETWORKS?
SOMETIMES. A FEW HOURS. NOT  ALL 24.
Jon: I DO. AS YOU WATCH IT, DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, I KNOW THOSE FOLKS. THEY ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. MANY ARE REALLY SMART REPORTERS, OH, MY GOD WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO THEM?
I USED TO WORK AT ABC AND CBS SO I DO HAVE FRIENDS AT BOTH NETWORKS AND OTHER PLACESS AS WELL. I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY, WE'RE IN A PUBLIC SERVICE MISSION. THEY ARE IN AN AUDIENCE BUSINESS. I THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT IT TAKES TO TRY TO BUILD AUDIENCES AND MAKE MONEY. WE LIKE THE AUDIENCE, FRANKLY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING. I THINK THAT OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU THINK. AND HOPEFULLY EXPANDS YOUR HORIZONS. EVERYTHING FROM PBS KIDS PROGRAMS TO DOCUMENTARIES TO THE STUFF --
Jon: NOW I CAN SEE WHY THEY WANT TO SHUT YOU GUYS DOWN. [ LAUGHTER ]
EVERY AMERICAN SPENDS ABOUT $1.35. AND FOR THAT YOU GET THIS ENTIRE CHANNEL FROM DOWNTON ABBEY TO THE KIDS STUFF TO KEN BURNS DOCUMENTARIES.
Jon: THIS JUST TURNED INTO A PLEDGE DRIVE, WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED HERE? [LAUGHTER] ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU GET THIS TOTE BAG AND A COPY OF DIE FLEDERMAUS SIGNED BY BEVERLY SILLS. THAT'S AT THE $60 LEVEL.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE NEWS BUDGETS NOW HAVE SHRUNK? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEWS BUSINESS ARE THEY DOING A  DISSERVICE BY CREATING SO MUCH NOISE AND HAS THAT  AFFECTED OUR COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OR IS THAT PUTTING TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THE POWER THEY WIELD?
NO, I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF  EMPHASIS. LOOK, IT TAKES AN INFORMED CITIZENRY TO ACTUALLY MAKE ANY CHANGES THAT COUNT. IF YOU CONTINUE TO CREATE CONTENT THAT IS WEAK, TO PUT IT MILDLY, I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INFORMED CITIZENRY THAT MAKES ANY DECISIONS. IF YOU WATCH JUST THE HALF HOUR NETWORK NIGHTLY NEWSCAST, IT HAS SHIFTED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT, EVEN SINCE WHEN I IMMIGRATED HERE RIGHT? I MEAN AT THAT TIME THERE WERE THREE GUYS.
Jon: WAIT A MINUTE, YOU IMM-- AND NOW YOU CONTROL OUR NEWS?
YEAH, THERE'S THAT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S MY PEOPLE'S JOB. IT'S A LITTLE BACK AND FORTH ETHNIC HUMOR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW, BUT IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THE SHOWS AT NIGHT NOW DON'T DRIVE THE AGENDA. THE AGENDA IS REALLY DRIVEN NOW ON THESE 24-HOUR SHOWS AND BUTTRESSED BY SOME OF THE MORE INFLAMMATORY BLOG OUTLETS.
THE BARGAIN USED TO BE, GIVE ME 22 MINUTES AND I'LL SHOW YOU THE WORLD. AND, I'VE READ ALL THE NEWSPAPERS AND I'M GOING  TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. BUT NOW I THINK THE BARGAIN IS, I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE OF WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, BUT I'LL ALSO TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US YOU WANT TO KNOW. WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT. I MEAN I CAN PROGRAM YOU A CHANNEL THAT PEOPLE WILL WATCH BESIDES COMEDY CENTRAL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IF YOU CAN DO THAT WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT.
YOU'LL HAVE CAR CHASES AND FIRES AND SCANTILY CLAD PEOPLE. AND THAT WILL SELL GREAT, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WRONG ANSWER. [ LAUGHTER ]
BUT THAT'S NOT NEWS TO ME. IF TIGER WOODS MAKES NEWS LET ESPN COVER IT OR THE GOLF CHANNEL. IF THE KARDASHIANS MAKE NEWS LET E CHANNEL COVER IT. IF I'M A DECIDER ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT'S NOT IT.
Jon: WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE KARDASHIANS? I DIDN'T REALIZE, DID THEY MAKE NEWS? IS IT KHLOE IS SHE OKAY? SHE'S FINE.
Jon: THANK YOU. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT ABOUT IT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WATCH NEWS WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS TO LOOK AT THE JUXTAPOSITION BETWEEN WHAT IS MAKING THE FRONT PAGE OF RESPECTED PAPERS AND WHAT THE FOCUS IS OF THE 24 HOUR NEWS NETWORKS THEY ARE OUTRAGE AND CONFLICT ORIENTED AND IT'S JUST NOISE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MATH ON HOW MUCH IT TAKES TO MAKE AN ORIGINAL REPORT FROM SOMEWHERE. YOU SEND A NEWS CREW OUT SOMEWHERE. IT MIGHT COST $5,000. YOU COME BACK AT THE NETWORK LEVEL WITH TWO MINUTES OF TV. OR YOU COULD YOU HAVE A SATELLITE WINDOW AND HAVE TWO PEOPLE YELL AT EACH OTHER FOR 15 MINUTES FOR $300. WHAT WOULD YOU RATHER DO? OR YOU COULD PRESS A BUTTON AND TAKE A LIVE HELICOPTER CAMERA FROM LOS ANGELES AND JUST FOLLOW A CAR CHASE FOR ALMOST FREE. I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE THAT MOTIVATED BY MONEY BUT TRUST ME OVER TIME, FACTS ARE EXPENSIVE AND PBS IS IN THE FACT BUSINESS.
I APPRECIATE IT. THAT LITTLE DESCRIPTION THERE, I BELIEVE IS CNN'S NEW MISSION. SO IT'S VERY NICE YOU BROUGHT IT UP. THE WEEKEND EDITION OF PBS NEWS HOUR AIRS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AT 6:00 P.M.  HARI SREENIVASAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
