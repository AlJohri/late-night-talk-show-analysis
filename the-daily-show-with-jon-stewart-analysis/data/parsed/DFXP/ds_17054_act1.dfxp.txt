FEBRUARY 1, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. HAPPY GROUNDHOG'S DAY EVE. WE HAVE A NICE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. BRAD PITT WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOT-- NOT-- NOT THAT ONE. ( LAUGHTER ). INSURANCE SALESMAN FROM POUGHKEEPSIE. THAT WAS A VERY WARM RESPONSE TO HIM. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST NIGHT'S PRIMARY RESULT OUT OF FLORIDA, WHERE MITT ROMNEY  DECISIVELY THUMPED NEWT GINGRICH BY 14 PERCENTAGE POINTS. NOW, I CAN EASILY BREAK THAT VOTE DOWN FOR YOU DEMOGRAPHICALLY, GEOGRAPHICALLY, GIVE YOU A SENSE FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS OF HOW BAD A NIGHT NEWT GINGRICH HAD. BUT PERHAPS A MORE SUCCINCT AND ENTERTAINING WAY TO EXEMPLIFY THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS DEFEAT, IMAGINE THIS SKATEBOARDER IS NEWT GINGRICH AND HE HAS SOME MOMENTUM OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA-- OH! OH, MY GOD! OH! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT-- THE RESULTS FOR NEWT GINGRICH IN FLORIDA ARE SIMILAR  TO THE HARDEST YOU COULD EVER BE HIT IN YOUR BALLS. DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? BUT IN THE END, THE VICTORY AND A SET OF STILL-FUNCTION, CUEVOS, WAS ROMNEY'S AND SOCELEBRATE ROMNEY UNVEILED THE NEW GENERAL ELECTION ROMNEY. ALWAYS EXCITING TO SEE A NEW ROMNEY. I WONDER WHAT THIS RON WILL BE LIKE.
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHEN OUR WHITE HOUSE REFLECTED THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE, NOT THE  WORST OF WHAT EUROPE HAS BECOME. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ADOPTED A POLICY OF APPEASEMENT AND APOLOGY. PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VIEW OF A FREE ECONOMY IS TO SEND YOUR MONEY TO HIS FRIENDS. LIKE HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE FACULTY LOUNGE WHO THINK THEY KNOW BETTER, PRESIDENT OBAMA  DEMONIZES AND DENIGRATES ALMOST EVERY SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY.
Jon:  WHEREAS I, MITT ROMNEY, ONLY DEMONIZE AND DENIGRATE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN A  FACULTY LOUNGE. ( LAUGHTER ). TEACHERS WITH THEIR FIVE-FIGURE SALARIES AND THEIR FANCY COFFEED CUPS, AND CHALK-DUSTED JACKETS  FROM MARSHALLS. YOU PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK! ( LAUGHTER ) OBAMA IS AN ELITIST WITH HIS ADVANCED DEGREE FROM HARVARD, SAYS THE MAN WITH TWO ADVANCED DEGREES FROM HARVARD. CAN'T WE JUST AGREE BOTH OF YOUR EXCELLENT EDUCATIONS MERIT OUR DISDAIN? PERHAPS IT'S WHAT OBAMA HAS NOT YET DONE BUT DEFINITELY WILL DO WITH HIS FANCY BOOK LEARNING.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TO FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM AMERICA AND MAKE IT SOMETHING PERHAPS WE  WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE.
Jon:  IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AMERICA, DOGS WALK THEIR OWNERS. ( LAUGHTER ). BASEBALLS HIT PEOPLE WITH BATS. ( LAUGHTER ) PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TO TURN THIS COUNTRY INTO A PLACE WHERE  WE EAT WITH OUR BUTTS AND POOP WITH OUR MOUTHS. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, EUROPE. BY THE WAY, I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT, WE COULD HAVE DONE A GRAPHIC FOR THAT. WE DIDN'T. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) RESPECT. BUT ENOUGH-- THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR NOT SHOWING ( BLEEP ) COMING OUT OF A MAN'S MOUTH. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S REALLY TERRIFIC OF YOU TO DO THAT. BUT ENOUGH FROM METROMAN IN HERE. LET'S HEAR FROM MEGAMIND. SURELY, THIS RESULT HAS HUMBLED MEGAMIND.
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY I WILL SIGN AN EXCLUSIVE ORDER.
Jon:  FIRST AT A OF WHAT! ARE YOU LAYING OUT WHAT YOU'LL DO ON YOUR FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT?
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY, I WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REPEALING EVERY ANTIRELIGIOUS  ACT OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IMMEDIATELY, PASS THE REPEAL OF THE DODD-FRANK BILL, ABOLISH ALL OF THE WHITE HOUSE CZARS. NO POINT IN HANGING OUT AND HAVING FUN. BEFORE WE GET TO GO TO THE VARIOUS BALLS THAT NIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WORK PERIOD. THIS IS GOING TO BE A WORKING PRESIDENCY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  NEWT GINGRICH APPEARS TO HAVE CONFUSEDLY THE FLORIDA REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WITH  THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND GETTING YOUR ASS KICKED WITH WINNING. YOU MAY THINK IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR NEWT TO BE LIMBERING UP HIS BILL-SIGNING HAND. AFTER ALL HE LOST BADLY IN FLORIDA AND THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT APPEARS TO HATE  HIM AS MUCH AS EVERYONE WHO IS NOT REPUBLICAN. BUT NEWT FEELS LIKE HE'LL BOUNCE BACK, AND THERE IS A GOOD REASON WHY.
I HAVE BEEN STUDYING WHAT AMERICA NEEDS TO DO SINCE THE FALL OF 1958. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU WERE 15. ( LAUGHTER ) YOUR CAMPAIGN JUST KEEPS GETTING SADDER AND SADDER. THAT'S-- THAT SENTENCE JUST SOUNDS LIKE IT'S FROM THE WORST ORIGIN STORY FOR A SUPER BILL  THAN EVER. WHEN I WAS 15 WE MOVED NEAR A TOXIC WASTE DUMP AND ONE DAY WHILE WALK HOME I WAS BITTEN BY  A RADIOACTIVE POLICY ANALYST. IF YOU THINK THAT SOUND DRAMATIC, GET A LODE OF THIS OLD CHESTNUT THAT SEEMS TO BE  STRAIGHT FROM THE ROMAN SENATE.
I PROMISE YOU, IF I BECOME YOUR PRESIDENT, I PLEDGE TO YOU MY LIFE, MY FORTUNE, AND MY  SACRED HONOR. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT I THINK NEWT GINGRICH JUST ASKED US ALL TO BE  HIS FOURTH WIFE. WE'LL BE RIG
