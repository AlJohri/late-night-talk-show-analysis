FEBRUARY 14, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT HARVARD ECONOMICS PROFESSOR EDWARD GLAZER HERE TO GIVE YOU ALL  YOUR MIDTERM GRADES. LISTEN. I THINK I JUST THREW MY BACK OUT. I HOPE MY UNDERSTUDY IS AVAILABLE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THE GUY IS THE UNDERSTUDY FROM  SPIDERMAN IS HERE COMPLETELY UNSCATHED BY INJURY. HE'S JUST SITTING THERE. THEY KEEP HIM IN A HYPERBARIC CHAMBER. TO KEEP HIM FRESH JUST IN CASE THE ACTUAL GUY WHO IS STARRING IN IT GETS HURT. OH, HE JUST GOT HURT. OKAY. I GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO NOW. SO, WE WERE ON VACATION. WHEN WE LAST CHECKED IN WITH OUR COVERAGE OF MESOPOTAMIA IT WAS ABOUT A WEEK AGO EGYPTIANS  WERE STILL DEMONSTRATING FOR REGIME CHANGE BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHILE THE NEW  TECHNOLOGY FORCES FOR CHANGE EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO COLD KOCH ANDERSON COOPER. I HOPE YOU'LL EXCUSE THE EXPRESSION. ( APPLAUSE ) I WILL... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I WILL... I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP  JOKE TO THAT THAT I WILL KEEP TO MYSELF. LEAVE COOP ALONE. HE'S ALL WE HAVE. SINCE THEN MUBARAK HAS STEPPED DOWN. THE MUMMY'S CURSE WAS BROKEN. THE CROWDS WERE JOYFUL. THE ONLY DANGER JOURNALISTS FACED WAS A DAUNTING CASE OF FREEDOM HERPES. WOW. ANDERSON COOPER HAS AGED A LOT IN ONE WEEK. APPARENTLY THAT'S HARRY SMITH WHO I'M BEING TOLD RIGHT NOW BY MY PRODUCER TASTES DELICIOUS. OF COURSE OUR OWN CAIRO BUREAU CHIEF AASIF MANDVI HAS BEEN IN TAHRIR SQUARE THROUGHOUT THESE  HISTORIC EVENTS. THE SCENE THERE MUST BE ELECTRIFYING (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  . IF I MAY SAY, THE SCENE IN TAHRIR SQUARE MUST BE ELECTRIFYING.
WELL IT WAS LAST WEEK. WHEN I WAS HERE STANDING BY TO REPORT THE STORY OF A LIFETIME. HEY, JON, YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SHOW AND A NEWS SHOW?
Jon: WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, WHEN BIG THINGS HAPPEN CRONKITE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OFF THE MOUNTAIN, TOWEL  DRIED AND FLOWN HOME.
Jon: WOULD HE HAVE STAYED TO FINISH HIS TURKEY LEG?
NO, HE WOULD NOT.
Jon: WE SCHEDULED THE TRIP A LONG TIME AGO. LOOK, HAS THE SITUATION REALLY CHANGED THAT MUCH SINCE LAST FRIDAY NIGHT?
KINDA. LET'S SEE. THE ARMY TOOK CONTROL. SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTION. DISSOLVED THE PARLIAMENT. CLEARED THE SQUARE. OTHER THAN THAT, STATUS QUO. JON BEFORE YOU LEFT REPORTERS GOT HASSLED. NOW THAT YOU'VE COME BACK, THERE'S NOBODY TO TALK TO. WHILE YOU WERE GONE, THERE WAS A SWEET SPOT OF PURE JOY HERE A TIME WHEN THE ARAB STREET  ROSE UP AND BEGAN KISSING REPORTERS. HOISTING THEM ON THEIR SHOULDERS FOR 48 HOURS HERE ALL A JOURNALIST NEED TO GET  LOVED UP WAS A LIVE FEED. BUT OF COURSE I HAD TO SPEND THE WEEK FILING MY OWN DISPATCHES IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
Jon: YOU SPENT THE WEEK MATSURBATING.
INTO A FAX MACHINE.
Jon: THANK YOU, AASIF MANDVI. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NOW IN THE WAKE OF THE WAKE OF  THE REVOLUTION, THE BIG QUESTION REMAINS. WHO CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS UPRISE SOMETHING.
IT WAS A REVOLUTION THAT REALLY STARTED ON FACEBOOK. IT WAS SUSTAINED BY TWITTER. AND SAVED BY GOOGLE.
Jon: AND OF COURSE RUINED BY ROULETTE. COME ON. REALLY? EVEN DURING A REVOLUTION. SO IN EGYPT THEY USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO FOMENT AND SUSTAIN A PEACEFUL REVOLUTION. WHEREAS HERE WE MIGHT USE IT TO SAY DO PROMOTIONS FOR NEVER SAY NEVER OR SEE AN OR GANG  TAN PEE INTO HIS OWN MOUTH. BY THE WAY, WHEN IS THAT COMING OUT IN 3-D? IT COULDN'T ALL BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE INTERNET. SURELY, THERE IS A DEEPER, MORE "I TOLD YOU SO "TYPE CAUSE.
CAN YOU TAKE ANY PRIDE IN WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE ALONG WITH  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH YOU TALKED ABOUT FREEDOM BACK AS EARLY AS 2004 COMING TO THE MIDDLE EAST. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID YOU'RE CRAZY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE PEOPLE NOW?
Jon: HEY, HEY, HEY, JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR. PRESIDENT BUSH AND TONY BLAIR DIDN'T INVENT FREEDOM IN THE EARLY 2000s. AND THEN GEORGE BUSH AND TONY BLAIR STOLE IT FROM THEM. OH, TWINS, WILL YOU EVER WIN? BY THE WAY, THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE IRAQ WAR WASN'T PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST  CAN'T HANDLE DEMOCRACY. IT WAS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE ITS FOURTH IMPORT. SOME OF THE ONLY PEOPLE I SEE WORRYING ABOUT FREEDOM IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WORK DOWN  THE HALL FROM YOU.
THE EXPERTS ARE CELEBRATING THIS AS A VICTORY FOR FREEDOM. MAYBE YOU GOT RID OF A DICTATOR TODAY. BUT WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW? RECENT POLLS IN EGYPT SHOW THAT 84% SAY THAT APOSTATES OR THOSE WHO FOR SAKE ISLAM  SHOULD FACE THE DEATH PENALTY.
GERMANY HAD DEMOCRACY AND VOTED IN HITLER.
Jon: I CAN TEAR... I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS. EGYPT, DURING YOUR ELECTIONS IF THERE'S A GUY RUNNING, HE HAS A LITTLE MOUSTACHE AND  WHENEVER HE TALKS YOU DOES THIS (RANTING), DON'T VOTE FOR THAT GUY. DON'T EVEN PUT THAT GUY ON THE BALLOT. (BEEP) THAT GUY. THAT WILL DO IT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE CHOSE TO  NEITHER GIVE CREDIT TO NOR FEAR FOR AMERICA. PLACING THE FOCUS ON, OF ALL THINGS, EGYPT.
THE CREDIT DOES NOT BELONG TO US THE UNITED STATES. THE CREDIT BELONGS TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREETS OF CAIRO WHO WERE SO BRAVE.
Jon: THAT IS OVER THE LINE, GERGEN. IT WAS US. AND THE INTERNET. GEORGE W. BUSH AND PETS DOT-COM. IT WAS FREEDOM FRIES AND J-DATE. PROBABLY NOT J-DATE. OF COURSE AS THE EUPHORIA DIES DOWN, THOSE PEOPLE IN EGYPT ARE PROBABLY WONDERING WHY WE  IN THE UNITED STATES HAD SUPPORTED THIS REPRESSIVE REGIME OF MUBARAK FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS NOW. FUNNY, THERE'S A SIMPLE EXPLANATION. FUNNY STORY. WE WERE TESTING YOU. WE HAD TO KNOW IF YOU WERE WORTHY OR IF UNDER DURESS YOU WOULD PERHAPS GIVE AWAY OUR  FREEDOM SECRETS. PERHAPS IT WOULD ALL MAKE SENSE IF I SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'VE WON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  DO YOU SEE NOW WHY WE COULDN'T  TELL YOU? THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY REALLY LOOKS LIKE. COME WITH ME AND YOU'LL BE IN A WORLD OF VOTER PARTICIPATION. TAKE MY HAND, GO INTO THE BOOTH AND VOTE FOR AN ELECTORAL REPRESENTATIVE WHO  WILL REPRESENT YOUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO THE ELECTORAL CONGLOMERATE. IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED. ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK WITH ALL OF IT. SORRY ABOUT THE TEAR GAS CANNISTERS. GOT TO GO.
