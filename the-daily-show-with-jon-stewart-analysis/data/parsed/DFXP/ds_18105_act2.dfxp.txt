( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  RECENTLY, WE'VE  BEEN READING THE THE "DAILY  SHOW" HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A POPULAR INTERNET SENSATION IN  CHINA, OF ALL PLACES. APPARENTLY THE CITIZENS OF  AMERICA'S FOREMOST GLOBAL  COMPETITOR LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AT THE FOIBLES OF US  YANKEES. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? A-HA, THEIR ECONOMY IS IN  SHAMBLES. THEY ARE DRAGONS ARE SO SMALL. ( LAUGHTER )  VERY FUNNY, CHINA. BEFORE YOU GET TOO COMFORTABLE,  PERHAPS IT'S TIME WE CHECK IN ON  THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF OUR REGULAR SERIES, THINGS MAY BE  BAD BUT LEAST OUR STREETS DON'T  MURP MYSTERY GOO. I SHOULD PROBABLY EXPLAIN.
THIS BIG FOAM, AND ACCORDING  TO MEADE MEADIA REPORTER,  FOULING SMELL APPEARED SATURDAY  EVENING. APPARENTLY THE STREET CRACKED  OUT AND IT JUST STARTED TO  OOZE OUT.
Jon:  THE MYSTERY OOZE OF  MANNED JING, PERHAPS THE MOST  DISGUSTING OF THE NANCY DREW  BOOKS. I GUESS-- I GUESS THE FIRST  QUESTION I'VE GOT TO REQUEST SC  IN ANY SITUATION THAT INVOLVES OOZE, HOW MUCH OOZE ARE WE  TALKING ABOUT?
IT SPREAD 150 FOOT RADIUS AND  NEARLY A FOOT HIGH.
Jon:  SO NEARLY HIGH  ENOUGH TO TOUCH CHINA'S  POISONOUS AIR. LEAVING WHAT THE CHINESE CALL  SWEET SPOT, OR AIR. WHAT IS THE OOZE I WOULD GO WITH  A SLURRY OF ( BLEEP ) AND BIS  QUICK. SO I ASSUME THE FAMED SCIENTIST  FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF PEOPLE'S R  CHINA CAME UP WAY SOLUTION.
THE AREA WAS CORDONED OFF AND  THE OOZE WAS WASHED INTO THE  SEWER. NO ONE KNOW WHAT THE OOZE IS OR  WHERE IT CAME FROM OR WHERE IT  SEEMS BACK INTO. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  6,000 YEARS OF  CULTURE AND SCIENCE, AND YOU  COME UP WITH HOSE. SO THE MYSTERIOUS FOUL-SMELLING  PROBABLY POISONOUS OOZE PROBABLY  WENT BACK INTO THE GROUND WHERE YOU KEEP YOUR WATER. DON'T GET SO HIGHAND MIGHTY,  CHINA. WE'VE GOT ON PROBLEMS BUT AT  LEAST WE DON'T HAVE WEIRD  SUBSTANCES APPEARING IN OUR CITY  STREET.
THIS IS PILING UP IN THE  STREET. BIG CHURNINGS WERE FOUNDER ON  THE SIDEWALK.
THAT BY-PRODUCT IS NOW TO THE  SURPRISE AND DISMAY OF MANY TO  BE TRUCKED TO TWO SITES.
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK.
