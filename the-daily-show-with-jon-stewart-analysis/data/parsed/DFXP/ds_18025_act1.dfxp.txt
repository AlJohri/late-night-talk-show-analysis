Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE  DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TODAY. FABULOUS AUTHOR JON MEACHAM. HE'S WRITTEN A BIOGRAPHY OF  JEFFERSON. CHER MONOHELMSLEY. (LAUGHTER). (LAUGHTER)  HOORAY ME! LAST NIGHT WE HAD ON THE PROGRAM  JASON SUDEIKIS FROM S.N.L . A  TREMENDOUS, VERY, VERY FUNNY MAN, PLAYS MITT ROMNEY AND JOE  BIDEN ON THE SHOW AND HE WAS  MAKING A JOKE ON THE SHOW ABOUT HOW WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF IN  THIS ELECTION IT TURNED OUT THAT  ROMNEY AND BIDEN HAD BOTH WON AND ENDED UP AS PRESIDENT AND  VICE PRESIDENT, WOULDN'T THAT  HAVE BEEN FUNNY AND I SAID, OH, I DON'T THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN,  JASON. AS A MAN WHO KNOWS A LOT ABOUT  LIKE -- AND HE'S LIKE "WELL, I  THOUGHT THAT WAS THE SCENARIO. WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT COULD  HAPPEN! HE WAS REFERRING TO A SCENARIO  WHICH I FOUND OUT LATER WHERE IF  THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE WAS TIED THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN  KICKED TO THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE PICKED MITT ROMNEY, THE  SENATE WOULD HAVE PICKED THE  VICE PRESIDENT, THEY WOULD HAVE PICKED JOE BIDEN AND THAT'S HOW  IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. ONCE AGAIN THERE'S -- ONE OF THE  THINGS I HATE THE MOST ABOUT ME  --  (LAUGHTER). IS HOW MUCH (BLEEP) I DON'T  KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  EVERYDAY THERE IS (BLEEP) THAT I  DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,  TELEVISION IS -- IF YOU'RE EVER  LOOKING TO DISPLAY YOUR IGNORANCE --  (LAUGHTER). WHAT A MEDIUM! (LAUGHTER)  SO JASON SUDEIKIS, I APOLOGIZE. HE JUST WALKED OUT AND I WAS UP  UNTIL 3:00 IN THE MORNING LIKE  ELECTORAL COLLEGE -- OH, I'M  STUPID! THAT BEING SAID, TONIGHT'S SHOW,  REPUBLICANS STILL REELING FROM  THEIR ELECTORAL DEFEAT LAST WEEK AND REASSESSING THEIR OUTREACH  EFFORTS AFTER SUFFERING ENORMOUS  EROSION OF SUPPORT AMONGST ASIANS, LATINOS AND AFRICAN  AMERICANS OR, AS REPUBLICANS  SOMETIMES REFER TO THE GROUPS, THE REASON THEIR KIDS DIDN'T GET  INTO THEIR FIRST-CHOICE SCHOOLS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  BUT THERE IS ONE -- OH, YES,  THEY DO! (LAUGHTER)  BUT THERE IS ONE BRIGHT SPOT ON  THE G.O.P.'S DEMOGRAPHIC MAP.
MARRIED WOMEN TENDED TO FAVOR  MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: MARRIED WOMEN! (LAUGHTER)  NOW WHY DO YOU THINK  SPECIFICALLY MARRIED WOMEN WOULD  FAVOR MITT ROMNEY? PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PAINT THIS  DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE MOST POSITIVE  LIGHT YOU CAN.
MARRIED WOMEN THINK ABOUT THE  FUTURE OF THEIR CHILDREN.
THEY HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITY  AND YOU'RE RUNNING A HOUSEHOLD.
SO MARRIED YOU TEND TO BE  MORE SETTLED, YOU'RE THINKING  ABOUT THE KIDS, THINKING ABOUT HOW THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO BE  WHEN THEY GROW UP.
THEY'RE NOT JUST SOME SELFISH  (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  OH. I'M SORRY. THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT. THEY PARAPHRASED IT.
AMONG SINGLE WOMEN, A  WHOPPING 67% VOTED FOR THE  PRESIDENT.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN, FOR EXAMPLE,  SINGLE WOMEN OTHER THAN THE  ABORTION ISSUE.
THEIR ISSUE IS ABOUT BORG.
TURNS OUT THEY ARE ONE-ISSUE  VOTERS.
WE HAD WOMEN WHO COULD  ACTUALLY AFFORD BIRTH CONTROL,  SUBURBAN COLLEGE EDUCATED WOMEN TURN OUT AND SAY "I WANT FREE  BIRTH CONTROL."
Jon: I MEAN, IT WAS  UNBELIEVABLE. THESE WEREN'T GROSS SLUTTY POOR  PEOPLE WOMEN! WE'RE TALKING TRI-DELT DEALTS,  ALPHA CHI OMEGAS, GAB BE GAB BE  HEYS. JOINING US NOW ARE SENIOR  WOMEN'S ISSUES CORRESPONDENT  KRISTEN SCHAAL. KRISTEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING  NOW. SINGLE WOMEN, WHAT THEY'RE  SAYING IS, VOTE DEMOCRATIC  BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA AND ONLY  THINK ABOUT ABORTION. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?
WELL, I WAS TOTALLY OFFENDED  UNTIL A CERTAIN RECENT LIFE  EVENT CHANGED MY PRIORITIES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH, RIGHT, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. YOU GOT MARRIED THIS SUMMER. CONGRATULATIONS. I HEARD YOU GOT MARRIED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S NICE. I HEARD IT WAS GREAT. I HEARD IT WAS -- I HEARD IT WAS  A GREAT WEDDING. I WASN'T INVITED.
NO. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: UM -- BUT YOU SEEM  LIKE THE SAME PERSON.
(LAUGHS)  HOW DARE YOU, JON? AS SOON AS A GROOM, MY GROOM,  CARRIED ME ACROSS THE THRESHOLD  I FELT SOMETHING NEW EXPLODING INSIDE ME. (LAUGHTER)  AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NO, I DON'T, I'M NOT  GONNA --
IT WAS CONCERN FOR AMERICA'S  FUTURE. BUT SINGLE WOMEN VOTE WITH THEIR  VAGINAS, JON! AND THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT ONE  ISSUE-- THE SUCKING AND THE  (BLEEP)ING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ISN'T THAT TWO ISSUES? (LAUGHTER)
NOT IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SORRY.
COME ON, JON, I MEAN, WE ALL  REMEMBER THE SINGLE ME. (LAUGHTER)  NO, I'M NOT SAYING I WANT TO  ENSLAVE MEN, I JUST WANT TO HURT  THEM A LITTLE, YOU KNOW?
IS THAT COCAINE?
BIRTH CONTROL. IF YOU CRUSH IT UP IT HITS YOU  SO FAST. ALL US LESBIANS ARE DOING IT.
Jon: WOW, I ACTUALLY DON'T  REMEMBER THAT. THAT WAS --  (LAUGHTER). BY THE WAY, IF YOU WERE A  LESBIAN, WHY DID YOU HAVE BIRTH  CONTROL PILLS?
WHY NOT. UNDER OBAMA THEY'RE FREE. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAYS, I'M NOT SINGLE ANYMORE  AND I FINALLY GET IT. I WILL FIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF  MY CHILDREN!
Jon: RIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T  HAVE CHILDREN.
NO, BUT I HAVE MY EYE ON A  FEW DOWN THE STREET. THEY ARE SO CUTE! AND VERY U.N. SUPERVISED.
Jon: ONE WORD OF AVICE IF  YOU DO HAVE THE KID. GO-GURT.
YUMMY!
Jon: YEAH, IT'S REALLY  NICE. (LAUGHTER)  SINGLE WOMEN ARE A GROWING  DEMOGRAPHIC BUT WHAT CAN  REPUBLICANS DO TO WIN THEIR VOTES, THEN?
WELL, JON, THEY HAVE TO FRAME  THEIR ARGUMENTS THROUGH PRISM OF  THE VAGINA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SOMEWHAT NARROW PRISM  TO LOOK THROUGH. (LAUGHTER)
NO, SOME ARE HUGE! (LAUGHTER)  BUT, JON, ALL VAGINAS HAVE A  SACRED, ALMOST MYSTICAL  FUNCTION.
Jon: WELL, YES, THEY  PRODUCE LIFE. THEY --
NO, THEY ATTRACT HUSBANDS! AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED, YOU HARDLY  NEED ONE ANYMORE.
Jon: WELL, NO, MARRIED  WOMEN DO ALSO USE THEIR VAGINAS  --
YEAH, I GUESS. MAYBE TO HAVE SEX WITH A  FOUR-STAR GENERAL, BUT HOW MANY  OF THOSE ARE THERE? (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FOUR STAR  GENERALS THERE ARE.
37 COUNTING ADMIRALS, BUT NOT  ENOUGH TO GO AROUND, OKAY? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO IN YOUR MIND WHAT  CAN REPUBLICANS DO TO VAGAZZLE  THEIR MESSAGE THEN?
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU, GIVE ME  ANY ISSUE.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT  IMMIGRATION?
HEY, AMERICA, LET'S TAKE  CHARGE OF OUR OWN PROTECTION. INSERT A DIAPHRAGM BETWEEN US  AND MEXICO TO STOP THOSE LITTLE  SWIMMERS FROM IMPLANTING IN OUR WOMB OF OPPORTUNITY, OUR  COUNTRY, OUR CHOICE! BUILD THE DANG FENCE! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WOW, THAT'S  IMPRESSIVE. THAT IS IMPRESSIVE. I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,  REPUBLICANS CAN TAKE CARE OF  SINGLE WOMEN AND IMMIGRATION WITH THE NUCLEAR OPTION.
Jon: NUCLEAR OPTION. WHAT'S THAT?
A MOONEY STYLE MASS WEDDING. TEN MILLION SINGLE LADIES, TEN  MILLION ILLEGAL MEXICAN  GARDENERS, 20 MILLION BRAND NEW  REPUBLICANS! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HITTING TWO BIRD WITH  ONE STADIUM.
EXACTLY! AND IF WE GET THE LADIES AND THE  LATINOS WE CAN KEEP IGNORING THE  BLACKS, RIGHT? HIGH FIVE! IN THE SKY! HIGH FIVE! IN THE SKY! HIGH FIVE, JON E BLOWING UP!
