WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HE IS A CHEF AND AUTHOR. HIS SHOW FOR THE TRAVEL CHANNEL IS CALLED NO RESERVATIONS.
PEOPLE HERE WHENEVER THEY HAVE A HANGOVER, THEY ALWAYS COME, EITHER WE TAKE THE  MEDIUM ONES OR THE BIG ONCE. NORMALLY THEY OPEN BETTER THAN THE SMALL ONCE. ALL RIGHT, SO --
YOU CAN TELL ME WHY YOU FISH HERE.
YOU COMPANY BACK HERE AND PICK A RESTAURANT, THIS IS SAY PLACE, THEY SIT THERE  AND COOK IT FOR US.
DONE.
I GOT TO GET OUT MORE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME ANTHONY BOURDAIN. KMEERS PLAUS--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jon: WE LOVE YOUR SHOW. IT'S A GREAT SHOW. HERE IS WHAT I HAVE DECIDE. YOUR JOB IS WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DO IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK. IT IS THE GREATEST, YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD, AMERICAN ALL OVER, ENGAGING WITH THE LOCAL, EATING THE LOCAL FOOD. IT'S AMAZING.
I HAVE THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
Jon: HOW OFTEN ARE YOU ON THE ROAD.
ABOUT 220 DAYS A YEAR, SOMETHING LAKE THAT. SO I'M AWAY FROM HOME A LOT. BUT YOU KNOW, I DECIDE WHERE WE GO. I MAKE THE SHOW THE WAY ME AND MY FRIENDS WANT TO MAKE IT. THE NETWORK INTERFERES NEAR TO NOT AT ALL. SO I CAN HARDLY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE BOSS.
Jon: IS THERE A PLACE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THAT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO GET TO, THE  ARRANGEMENTS COULDN'T BE MADE, WAS THERE --
I DREAMED FOR A LONG TIME, WE TRIED YEAR AFTER YEAR TO DO A-- I'M OBSESSED WITH APOCALYPSE NOW AND HEART OF DARKNESS. AND I SEE MYSELF EVERY YEAR GOING UP THE RIVER, YOU KNOW, TRACING THE TRIP UP THE CONGO.
Jon: UH-HUH.
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS THAT HAVE PREVENTED THAT FROM HAPPENING.
Jon: I CAN JUST SEE THE SHOT, YOU RISING UP FROM THE RIVER, SO NOTHING IN LET'S  SAY WAR-TORN REGIONS.
WELL, WE HAD A TASTE OF THAT IN 2006. WE WERE SHOOTING-- .
Jon: A HAPPY FOOD SHOW.
AND IT ENDED UP GETTING EVACUATED BY THE MARINES. WE HAVE CERTAINLY SHOT AT SOMEPLACES WHERE ANYTHING RESEMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS, YOU KNOW, WELL, NOT REALLY THERE. IT IS IMPRESSIVE.
Jon: SOME OF THE PLACES YOU GO TO SOME OF THE THINGS YOU EAT, IT'S IMPRESSES  IMPRESSES-- IMPRESS OF. I HAVE GOTTEN DIARRHEA FROM WATCHING YOUR SHOW. I HAVE, I WAS STRUCK DOWN RECENTLY WITH A TERRIBLE, WATCHING THE MOZAMBIQUE PREVIEW AND JUST GOT HIT, JUST BAD. COULDN'T BELIEVE THE HOUSE FOR TWO DAYS.
WE JECK ON THE SHOW IF THERE IS NOT AT LEAST A 50% CHANCE OF DIARRHEA WHEN YOU  EAT SOMETHING IT'S ALMOST NOT WORTH EATING.
Jon: IT REALLY ISN'T. DO YOU HAVE, LIKE ARE THERE CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS THAT YOU TAKE WHEN YOU GO INTO THESE  AREAS, LIKE SHOTS AND --
YEAH, WE'VE HAD THE FULL SPECTRUM BUT HONESTLY WE AVOID THE HOTEL BREAKFAST  BUFF AYE, THAT THING IS LETHAL.
Jon: WOULD YOU SAY THAT EVEN IN THE STATES.
THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF FORLORN, THE SHINY HAM, THE CON GUILED EGGS, THE LITTLE-- NO, THAT STUFF IS, THAT IS A INVESTIGATOR, THAT IS NOT A MEAL.
Jon: .
THE DISPLAY OF BACON ALWAYS, BECAUSE I'M A HUGE FAN OF BACON BUT ONCE IT  GETS, SOMEHOW WHEN IT STARTS TO LAYER AND GET ON TOP OF-- IN THE CREVASSES LIVES BACONELA  OR WHATEVER IT IS.
IF IT'S BOARD JERKY LIKE, THEN BACON LIKE, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE, YEAH.
Jon: HAVE YOU BEEN STRUCK BY THE ABILITY OF FOOD TO BRING CULTURES TOGETHER  EVERYWHERE, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A PLACE WHERE FOOD WAS NOT IMPORTANT TO THE  CULTURE, WHERE IT WAS --
THERE ARE, IT'S A BAD PLACE, YOU KNOW, WHERE PEOPLE ARE IMMUNE TO THE  JOYS OF EATING AND THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BUDGET. DEPENDABLY THE BEST FOOD, THE BEST TIMES WE HAVE HAD ON THE ROAD ARE OFF THEN VERY POOR COUNTRIES WHERE  THEY HAVE LITTLE TO WORK WITH AND DO A LOT WITH IT. COUNTRIES THAT JUST DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO FOOD AT ALL,A A THE A ALL, SOMEONE WHO  SAYS I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN FOOD, IS LIKE SAYING I DON'T LIKE MUSIC  AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SEX EITHER. -- HATE JOY.
Jon: COLORS DON'T DO IT FOR ME.
YEAH. NOT INTERESTED.
Jon: IT'S INCREDIBLE. I'M ALWAYS, YOU KNOW, I DO A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF TRAVELING, TRAVELING FOR  COMPANY DAE AND GOING TO CLUBS. BUT I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS HOW YOU INFILTRATE THE LOCAL RESTAURANT SYSTEM. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? WHERE DO YOU GO TO FIND ACTUAL REAL GOOD LOCAL FOOD.
DRINK A LOT WITH LOCALS.
Jon: SO IT STARTS WITH DRINK.
IT REALLY HELPS. YOU WANT TO EAT WHERE GOING TO THE EARLY MORNING MARKET IS USEFUL BECAUSE YOU SEE  WHAT PEOPLE ARE BUYING AND THE LITTLE PLACES ASHE THEM THAT MARKET WORKERS EAT IN. PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF THEIR FOOD. AND THEY WILL TILL, THEY WILL RECOGNIZE A FREAKISHLY TALL AMERICAN AND SAY HAVE YOU EATEN THIS YET. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME-- JSES YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. (LAUGHTER) IN NEW YORK, DO YOU FIND, IS THAT YOUR COMFORT LEVEL NOW, YOU FEEL LIKE ALL, IN NEW YORK.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG CITY, I'M ALWAYS, YOU ALWAYS DISCOVER NEW THINGS ABOUT TELEPHONE. BUT THE PERFECT EXAMPLE, YOU ALWAYS ARE LOOKING FOR, WHAT DOW EAT IN NEW YORK IF YOU  ONLY HAVE ONE DAY HERE, NOT THE BEST RESTAURANT, WHAT ARE WE GOOD AT IN NEW YORK, THE BEST AT IN NEW YORK THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS GOOD AT. WAY SAY BAGELS, NOVA CREAM CHEESE, DELI. WE ARE BETTER AT DELI THAN ANYBODY. SO THAT IS WHAT YOU DO. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE SORT OF VIETNAMESE VERSION OF DELI OR SINGAPOREAN  VERSION OF DELI WA, DO THEY DO BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE, LIKE A NOOZ EL BAGEL, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YOU MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING.
Jon: THAT IS WHY I DON'T COOK IT IS GREAT TO YOU HAVE. WE LOVE THE SHOW, THE 8th SEASON, NO RESERVATIONS PREMIERS ON THE TRAVEL  CHANNEL APRIL 9th, 9:00 P.M., ANTHONY BOURDAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
