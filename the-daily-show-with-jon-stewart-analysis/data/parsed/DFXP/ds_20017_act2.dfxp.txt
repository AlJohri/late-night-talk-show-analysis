(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG AND ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN SEASON. I'M FEELING WISTFUL. SO MANY MEMORABLE MOMENTS: YOU HAD YOUR MITCH McCONNELL'S SILENT AVANT-GARDE CAMPAIGN ADS, WHO CAN FORGET CHARLIE CRIST'S BALL FAN, AND OF COURSE THE AD THAT STARTED IT ALL.
I'M JONI ERNST, I GREW UP CASTRATING HOGS ON AN IOWA FARM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU HAD ME AT CASTRATING HOGS. OF COURSE THE YEARS MOST AMAZING CONGRESSIONAL RACE HAS ONLY GOTTEN AMAZINGLIER.
MY OPPONENT SHOULD BE THE LAST ONE TO TALK ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY BECAUSE YOU EMBARRASS THIS COUNTRY AND THIS DISTRICT WHEN YOU WENT TO ISRAEL AND SKINNY DIPPED IN THE SEA OF GALILEE.
Jon: COME ON! WHO COULD FORGET STATEN ISLAND'S SHAME WHEN CONGRESSMAN GRIMM WAS DIPPING HIS SAUSAGE AND MEAT BALLS IN LAKE TIBERIAS? (LAUGHTER) YEAH! FOR THE RECORD, GRIMM DENIES HAVING BEING NAKED IN THE GALILEE AND GOING INTO TUESDAY LEAD POLLS BY 19 POINTS. JUST ONE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF COUNTS IN HIS FEDERAL FRAUD AND TAX INDICTMENT. SO I'M TAKING THE UNDER. BUT AS OF LAST NIGHT THERE IS AN UNDERDOG IN THE RACE FOR [BLEEP] 2014 CAMPAIGN MOMENT.
I GIVE YOU LAST NIGHT'S DEBATE FOR CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR.
GOVERNOR DANNEL MALLOY AND TOM FOLEY WERE IN THE STUDIO.
ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING PORTIONS OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A QUESTION FROM A VIEWER IN ESSEX.
CHARLES SAYS ODALISQUE IS A TYPE OF FEMALE SLAVE OR CONCUBINE AND THE NAME OF TOM FOLEY'S BOAT. WHY HAVE YOU NOT CHANGED IT?
AS A REGISTERED VOTER I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR STANCE ON THE REAL ISSUE. FOR INSTANCE, WHY ODALISQUE AND NOT ONE OF THEM GAME OF THRONE GIRLS THERE LIKE YOUR CERSEI OR YOUR SHAE. NOW THERE'S A SEX SLAVE NAME I'D THROW ON THE BACK OF A BOSTON WHALER. LOOK, THIS FOLEY FELLA SEEMS LIKE AN UPSTANDING GENTLEMAN. I'M SURE HE HAS A PERFECTLY REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR HIS BOAT'S NAME.
ODALISQUE REALLY MEANS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, A BEAUTIFUL THING.
NOT THAT WOMEN ARE THINGS, I MEAN, I'M NOT -- THAT'S NOT WHAT-- I'M NOT SAYING WOMEN ARE THINGS. I'M NOT SAYING WOMEN ARE BOATS. I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE BOATS, I'M SAYING THEY'RE SEX OBJECTS. I [BLEEP] BOATS. NO, WAIT. WHY IS THIS SO HARD. FOLEY 2014.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOT A LOT OF AUDIENCES WILL APPLAUD THE PUNCH LINE, I [BLEEP] BOATS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS CROWD SO SPECIAL. COME ON, FOLEY! COME ON FOLEY, YOU'RE LOSING THEM. THEY ALREADY GOT YOU SOME KIND OF ELITIST MARITIME HISTORICAL WHOREMONGER. LET THEM KNOW YOU ARE A MAN OF THE PEOPLE.
I'M GREAT ENJOYER OF THE ARTS AND CULTURE. AND ODELISQUE ARE THE NAMES OF MANY GREAT PAINTINGS IN THE ART WORLD. IT DOESN'T MEAN A SEX SLAVE.
COME ON, CONNECTICUT, DO REALLY WANT A CANDIDATE WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ART WORLD? I MEAN, MY OPPONENT GOVERNOR MALLOY IS SO OUT OF TOUCH HE SEES NARRATIVE ELEMENTS IN A ROTHKO. (APPLAUSE) OF COURSE FOLEY'S OPPONENT THE SITTING GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME SUGGESTING THIS IS ALL A TEMPEST IN A TEA CUP. ACTUALLY HE SEEMED PRETTY UPSET ABOUT THE WHOLE BOAT NAME GATE THING.
IT IS ACTUALLY NAMED FOR A PARTICULAR SEX SLAVE. AND THE MAN HAS A DAUGHTER, MY GOD. CHANGE THE NAME OF YOUR BOAT.
Jon: HOW IS IT WORSE THAT IT IS A PARTICULAR SEX SLAVE? I MEAN LOOK, IF HE HAD NAMED HIS BOAT SS ANONYMOUS WHORE, I WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT. BUT YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T KISS AND TELL. BUT I THINK -- I THINK THE CHOICE IS CLEAR THOUGH, TOM FOLEY IS A SNOOTY, BOAT-OWNING ART HOOKER-NAMING KNOW IT ALL, NOT LIKE THE DOWN HOME GOVERNOR MALLOY.
SAPPHIRE IS A TYPE OF GEMSTONE AND THE NAME OF DANNEL MALLOY'S BOAT. ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME? (LAUGHTER) SAPPHIRE? YOU ARE GIVING FOLEY [BLEEP] FOR ODELAY OR WHATEVER THAT NAME WAS AND MEANWHILE YOU'VE NAMED YOUR BOAT AFTER THE SINGLE MOST COMMON STRIPPER NAME THIS SIDE OF BAMBI? NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHAT ODALISQUE IS BUT EVERYBODY IN CONNECTICUT KNOWS SAPPHIRE. EVERY DAY YOU PROBABLY TAKE YOUR YACHT, YOU PROBABLY SAIL DOWN TO BUOY'S, THE STRIP JOINT BY THE SEA. SIT BACK, ENJOY YOUR LOBSTER ROLL AND WATCH SAPPHIRE AND CINNAMON DO THEIR THING. WELL, WHOEVER WINS TOMORROW I'M GUESSING CONNECTICUT WILL BE OKAY SINCE EVERYONE THERE SEEMS TO HAVE A BOAT. EVEN THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE IS LIKE NOBODY SAYS NOTHING ABOUT MY BOAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
