FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUESTS, OH YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THIS. MARTIN GILENs AND BENJAMIN PAGE THEY ARE THE AUTHORS OF A NEW ACADEMIC STUDY TESTING THEORIES OF AMERICAN POLITICS, ELITES, INTEREST GROUPS AND AVERAGE CITIZENS. IF YOU READ BUT ONE EMPIRICALLY BASED, POST-SURVEY QUANTITIVE MULTIVARIED ANALYSIS OF -- [LAUGHTER] YOU SHOULD, AH (bleep) IT, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FIRST, THOSE OF US WHO WHILE WATCHING CONGRESS CONTINUE TO BE UNABLE TO BRING EVEN AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE TO A FLOAT STILL BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO EARN PEOPLE'S TRUST. THIS NEXT SEGMENT, PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU. [LAUGHTER] A PERFORMANCE REVIEW WE CALL U.S. GOVERNMENT, YOU MUST CHECK YOURSELF VIS A VIS YOUR ETHICAL OR OTHERWISE COMPETENCY-BASED PERFORMANCE ISSUES PURSUANT TO THE REQUISITE FEDERAL BYLAWS AND POPULAR INTERESTS, OR IT BECOMES ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY WRECK YOURSELF. BEFORE THEY BEGIN THE REVIEW LET ME JUST GET OUT MY CLIPBOARD AND MY (bleep) PENCIL. [ LAUGHTER ] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] (bleep). ALL RIGHT. LET'S BEGIN. IT'S REALLY JUST A PROP. WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. IRS IF YOU ARE NASTY. FIRST, SOME GOOD NEWS. REMEMBER WHEN WE SUSPECTED THE IRS OF UNFAIRLY TARGETING CONSERVATIVE GROUPS. TURNS OUT THEY WERE ALSO TARGETING PROGRESSIVE GROUPS, SO OOPS. KEEP UP THE TARGETING. ALTHOUGH, THERE'S ONE AREA WHERE THE IRS MIGHT WANT TO IMPROVE.
A REPORTED 1% OF THE IRS WORK FORCE OWES BACK TAXES TO THE IRS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT'S LIKE RAIN ON YOUR WEDDING -- IT'S A FREE RIDE WHEN YOU ON -- DON'T LIKE RIDES. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY YOU WERE SAYING, THE PEOPLE AT THE PAY US YOUR TAXES PLACE DON'T PAY THEIR TAXES.
IT'S QUITE LOW WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT 8% OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OWES BACK TAXES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
Jon: AH YES, BUT IT'S QUITE HIGH WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IT'S THE IRS. IT'S LIKE SAYING WELL ONLY 1% OF THE WORKERS AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ARE SPREADING DISEASE. [ LAUGHTER ] MOST OF THEM ARE NOT OPENING VIALS OF SMALL POX ON CROWDED SUBWAYS AT ALL. I GUESS THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS TO HIRE ANOTHER IRS PERHAPS TO POLICE THEM. AN IIRS. PERHAPS WE NEED AN IIIRS AND AN IVRS. [ LAUGHTER ] PRETTY SOON WE'RE ALL JUST PART OF A NESTING DOLL OF OVERSIGHT, PARANOIA AND SUSPICIOUS, EACH OF US INVESTIGATING THE NEXT TO INFINITY UNTIL IT TURNS OUT WE'VE REALLY JUST BEEN INVESTIGATING OURSELVES THE WHOLE TIME. â™ª  [LAUGHTER] AND MAYBE THEN WE REALIZE RIGHT AND WRONG ARE JUST TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN WE CALL THE UNIVERSE OR DID I JUST BLOW YOUR MIND? [LAUGHTER] YEAH, PROBABLY NOT. YOU KNOW, CAN I ALWAYS DO THAT, BY THE WAY. [ LAUGHTER ] ALWAYS A CAMERA WITH A PSYCHEDELIC BACKGROUND. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WHERE THE IRS HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT LAX, SOCIAL SECURITY HAS BEEN IF ANYTHING A LITTLE TOO VIGILANT.
SOME TAXPAYERS ALREADY GETTING QUITE A SURPRISE, MONEY TAKEN OUT OF THEIR TAX REFUNDS TO PAY DEBTS THEIR PARENTS OWED.
Jon: OH, LIKE RAISING ME TO BE AFRAID TO LOVE WASN'T PUNISHMENT ENOUGH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO COME AND TAKE MY CAR AND I LOVE THAT CAR IN AN UNCOMPLICATED WAY. NOW, SOCIAL SECURITY I KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO SAY HEY, THAT WASN'T US. COME ON, PROBABLY SOME OTHER MASSIVE PUBLIC WELFARE PROGRAM FUNDED THROUGH PAYROLL TAXES. WE HAVE WITNESSES.
TWO MONTHS AGO MARY GRICE WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE U.S. TREASURY HAD CONFISCATED HER TAX REFUNDS, STATE AND FEDERAL TOTALING $4500. THE CLAIM AGAINST HER CAME FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WHICH SAID IT OVERPAID DEATH BENEFITS TO MARY'S FAMILY AFTER HER FATHER SCOTT GRICE DIED IN 1960. MARY WAS FIVE YEARS OLD.
Jon: OH. HOW DID FIVE-YEAR-OLD MARY AND HER GRIEVING MOTHER NOT CATCH THAT CLERICAL ERROR? [LAUGHTER] HUNT HER DOWN 50 YEARS LATER AND MAKE HER PAY. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW TO BE FAIR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, THREE DAYS AFTER THE MARY GRICE STORY BROKE DID EVENTUALLY CHECK THEMSELVES.
THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IS HALTING A PROGRAM UNDER WHICH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAD THEIR TAX REFUNDS SEIZED TO PAY OFF OLD DEBTS.
Jon: YES, YES NOTHING BRINGS ABOUT THE RAISING OF CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE PEOPLE FINDING OUT ABOUT (bleep) YOU ARE DOING. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH BRINGS US TO THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS. BACKLOG TROUBLES AT THE NATIONAL OFFICE ARE WELL KNOWN. BUT DON'T THINK LOCAL OFFICES CAN'T COMPETE BAD-WISE. AS MANY AS 40 VETERANS AT THE PHOENIX V.A. MAY HAVE DIED WAITING FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT.
MANAGERS WERE ACTUALLY KEEPING TWO WAITING LISTS.
THERE WAS AN UNOFFICIAL WAITING LISTS AND VETERANS' NAMES COULD BE ON IT MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS BEFORE THEY WERE MOVED TO THE OFFICIAL APPOINTMENT LIST. THE PURPOSE OF THE TWO LISTS WAS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE V.A. WAS SEEING PATIENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Jon: THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT. THESE ARE THE SCREAMING JARS I HAVE FOR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. THERE'S ONE HERE FOR WHEN THE METS LOSE. IF SPRINGSTEEN IS EVER DECONSTRUCTED, PEOPLE WHO EAT PIZZA WITH A FORK. DONALD TRUMP. HOLD ON A SECOND. LET ME SEE WHAT I HAVE. I KNOW MY -- WHERE IS MY VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT. [ LAUGHTER ] [SCREAMING BLEEP BLEEP] [  APPLAUSE  ] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU KNOW IN A STATION LIKE THIS YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. WHO IS GOING STEP UP TO THE PLATE HERE?
IN AN INTERVIEW THIS AFTERNOON THE HEAD OF PHOENIX V.A. DENIED KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT ALL THIS.
Jon: OH, OK. WELL, CASE CLOSED. NOTHING TO SEE HERE. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE COINCIDENCES. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO TELL US?
CNN HAS OBTAINED E-MAILS SHOWING TOP MANAGEMENT INCLUDING PHOENIX V.A. DIRECTOR SHARON HELMAN KNEW ABOUT THE ACTUAL WAIT TIMES, KNEW ABOUT THE OFF THE BOOKS LIST AND DEFENDED  ITS USE TO HER STAFF.
Jon: I'M GOING TO NEED A BIGGER (bleep) JAR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
