JON: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. LET ME SAY SOMETHING. FIRST OF ALL,  LET ME WELCOME YOU PROPERLY. WELCOME, WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN AWHILE.
THANK YOU.
JON: SECOND OF ALL, LET ME SAY THIS. AND AGAIN, YOU AND I HAVE HAD A RELATIONSHIP FOR MANY YEARS. WE KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL. I'M ALWAYS HONEST WITH YOU.
YA.
JON: YOU LOOK LIKE [BEEP]. AND, I SAY THAT -- THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES YOU COME ON THE PROGRAM AND I SAY I THOUGHT TO MYSELF OH I DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE HAVING TOM CRUISE ON TONIGHT.
YEAH YEAH.
JON: THIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE TIMES I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I FEEL LIKE [BEEP]
JON: YA.
CAUSE TRYING TO WORK OUT. I WORKED OUT. AND I LOST A BIT OF WEIGHT. I'M BASICALLY A FAT GUY AT HEART. AND, IT'S KILLING ME.
JON: CAUGHT UP WITH YOU.
TRYING TO KEEP FIT IS LITERALLY KILLING ME. CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING UP. SO, I STILL EAT PIZZA AND GET DRUNK EVERY NIGHT. THEN I HAVE TO GO FOR A RUN IN THE MORNING LIKE ROCKY. IT KILLS ME. I TRY TO BEAT THE SYSTEM, RIGHT. NOW I'M, I'M WORKING OUT MORE AND MORE. SO MY SHOULDERS AND MY KNEES  ARE GONE. MY INSIDE -- I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SAY OH, I DIDN'T DIE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. I EAT. YOU KNOW I WORK OUT. I THINK I'M WORKING OUT AND THINKING BEER, PIZZA. LIKE REWARDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
JON: SO TO YOU, DEATH AT THIS POINT WOULD BE BLESSED RELIEF.
SORT OF. SORT OF. I MEAN, I DON'T MIND WHERE I DIE, THE GYM OR ANYTHING, AS LONG AS --
JON: DO YOU HAVE A PLAN ON THAT?
NO.
JON: IS THERE A GLORIOUS WAY THAT RICKY GERVAIS WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT?
NO.
JON: DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT IN A BLAZE OF GLORY, TO SOME EXTENT?
I HAVE A LIST OF THINGS I DON'T WANT TO DO. I DON'T WANT TO DIE BEING SQUASHED BY A SAFE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T WANT A COMEDY DEATH.
JON: WHAT ARE YOU, A ROAD RUNNER CARTOON?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? RUNNING IN A TUNNEL AND COMING OUT ON A TRAIN OR HE SAT ON A SPIKE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO, NO ONE AT A FUNERAL -- THEY WOULD BE LAUGHING ABOUT HOW I FELL ON A SPIKE OR SOMETHING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO DON'T WANT IT TO BE A COLD DEATH.
JON: DON'T YOU THINK AS A COMEDIAN YOU OWE IT TO YOUR AUDIENCE TO SOME EXTENT TO GO OUT IN A BLAZE OF HILARIOUS.
IT WAS A TERRIBLE STORY IN ENGLAND. AND SOME COLLEGE STUDENTS GOT DRUNK, THEY WERE MOONING LIKE PASSING TRUCKS. AND ONE GOT HIT AND KILLED. BUT THINK OF TRYING TO TELL THE MOTHER. IT'S LIKE HE DIED OF A BAD SENSE OF HUMOR. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
JON: YA. THAT'S TOUGH. YA.
COSMIC HUMOR KARMA CAME BACK. BUT YA, YOU KNOW --
JON: I GOTTA TELL YOU THOUGH. PANTS DOWN, ASS OUT. THAT'S THE WAY TO GO TO SOME EXTENT.
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE MUSIC.
JON: PANTS DOWN ASSES OUT. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. WE OPEN IN TWO DAYS, PEOPLE.
JON STEWART HAD A CHANGE OF DIRECTION.
JON: YOU'RE AT AN AGE, I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT, YOU'RE AT AN AGE.
WE'RE ABOUT THE SAME, AREN'T WE?
JON: UMMMM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, I THINK WE'RE AT THE SAME AGE --
I'M 52. WHAT ARE YOU.
JON: I'M TALKING ABOUT BIOLOGICALLY.
WHAT AGE IS THERE BIOLOGICAL -- WHAT WEIRD COSMIC SYSTEM. I'M ONLY THREE BY THE COSMOS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 51 IS 51. HOW MANY TIMES. HOW MANY TIMES DID THE EARTH GO AROUND THE SUN SINCE YOU WERE BORN.
JON: YOU AND YOUR OUTER CORE IS LIKE 52. BUT INSIDE YOU'RE LIKE A GERMAN SHEPHERD INSIDE AGING 7 YEARS OVER EVERY YEAR, ON THE INSIDE.
I FEEL THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THE THING IS, WE WEREN'T MET TO LIVE THIS LONG.
JON: WHAT.
EVOLUTIONARY SPEAKING. YEARS AGO, WE'D BE LIKE ELDERS AT THE VILLAGE AT LIKE 35, WE'D LOSE OUR TEETH, THEY'D FEED US A BIT. THEN WE GET HIT BY A WILD BORE AND DIE IN A HUT.
JON: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THAT'S THE [BLEEP] WAY TO GO OUT. THAT'S THE WAY. WILD BORE, HUT, PANTS DOWN.
AND THEN SCIENCE COMES ALONG AND SAYS WE CAN MAKE HIM LIVE TO A 100. YEAH, BUT I'M IN A BUCKET WEEPING, SO LET ME DIE. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. THAT'S A WEIRD THING TO SAY.
JON: IT IS A LITTLE BIT WEIRD. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHY ARE YOU IN THE BUCKET?
THAT'S THE WAY I WANT TO GO.
JON: YOU WANT TO GO --
I WANT TO BE IN A BUCKET. PEOPLE FEED ME. NURSES -- WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT. SITTING IN THE BUCKET WATCHING TELLY. NAKED IN A BUCKET, RIGHT? I EAT AS MUCH PIZZA AND DRINK AS MUCH BEER. THEN THEY TIP ME OUT. THAT'S -- THAT'S A GREAT [BEEP] LIFE. THAT'S A GREAT LIFE.
JON: IF YOU, IF YOU LITERALLY DIE IN A BUCKET.
YES.
JON: DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TOO LITERAL. WHAT DID HE DO? HE KICKED THE BUCKET. IT'S NOT -- IT'S TOO LITERAL.
YOU CAN JUST FILL IT UP WITH SOIL AND PLANT.
JON: DO YOU HAVE ANY HOPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. WHAT ABOUT THIS.
GO ON.
JON: WHAT IF THEY COULD DOWNLOAD YOU JUST YOUR THOUGHTS,  NOT OBVIOUSLY THIS. WHAT IF THEY COULD KEEP YOU ALIVE IN A KIND OF --
COMPUTER.
JON: -- ANIMATED, YES. YOU ARE AWARE LIKE A ROBOT WARRIOR BUT RICKY GERVAIS AND HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS. WOULD YOU WANT THAT?
HOLD ON. NO. WHAT IF THEY COULD DO THAT AND YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL ALIVE. YOU WERE IN VIRTUAL REALITY. YOU THOUGHT HAD YOU THE BEST LIFE EVER. YOU WENT ON FOREVER. YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT. YOU'RE DOING ALL OF THOSE THINGS. YOU'RE FIGHTING PEOPLE. YOU GET, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
JON: YES.
WILD BORES. I'D STILL CHOOSE THE VIRTUAL BUCKET. YES I WOULD STILL BE A VIRTUAL THING IN A BUCKET. LIKE THAT. I STILL -- I'M GOING FOR THE BUCKET, ALWAYS. I WOULD ALWAYS GO FOR THE BUCKET.
JON: I BELIEVE.
THIS IS --
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SHAGGING PANDAS.
JON: NO, THIS IS NOT WEIRD. I BELIEVE NOW WE HAVE FRAMED NOT ONLY YOUR DEATH BUT YOUR AUTOBIOGRAPHY. "RICKY GERVAIS, I WILL ALWAYS GO FOR THE BUCKET." DONE. I'M HAPPY TO SETTLE IT FOR YOU. THE SECOND SEASON OF "DEREK." THE SECOND SEASON IS ON NETFLIX, RIGHT.
IT IS.
JON: IT'S ON NETFLIX. RICKY GERVAIS, WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
