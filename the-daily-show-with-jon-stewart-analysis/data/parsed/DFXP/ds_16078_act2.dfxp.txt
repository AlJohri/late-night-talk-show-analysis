FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HERE ON THE SHOW LIKE TO CHECK IN WITH THE GAY COMMUNITY IN A SEGMENT  WE FOR SOME REASON DECIDED TO CALL "WE'RE HERE, WE'RE CLEAR, GET NEWSED TO IT. SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES ITS LONG PATH THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM. NEW YORK SEEMS POISED TO BECOME THE MOST POPULATED AREA YET TO CODIFY MARRIAGE EQUALITY.
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO ANNOUNCES HIS MARRIAGE EQUALITY BILL, WHICH WOULD ALLOW GAY  COUPLES TO TIE THE FALMOUTH.
ONE VOTE IN THE STATE SENATE IS ALL THAT'S NEEDED TO MAKE  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE THE LAW IN NEW YORK.
Jon: ONE VOTE. ONE, DO YOU HEAR THAT, CALIFORNIA? EAT OUR DUST. [LAUGHTER] WE WERE A GAY MECCA WAY BEFORE YOU CAME ALONG, LET ME TELL YOU THAT. IN NEW YORK CITY, WALT WHITMAN WAS BANGING DUDES IN BROOKLYN WHEN YOU FOLKS WERE STILL  SQUATTING IN A RIVER BITING GOLD NUGGETS, HUH. IF ANYONE'S GETTING MARRIAGE EQUALITY, IT'S GOING TO BE NEW YORK. CAPISCE, CALIFORNIA? ENJOY YOUR COURT CASES. WE'RE JUST GOING TO PUSH THIS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. WE'LL HAVE IT DONE QUICK.
THE BATTLE WILL GO THROUGH THE HANDS OF NEW YORK REPUBLICAN ANDREW LANZA.
Jon: THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE. STATEN ISLAND REPUBLICAN, HUH. I GUESS MARRIAGE EQUALITY RESTS ON THE HANDS OF WHETHER THIS GUY IS WILLING TO BE CALLED THE  STATEN ISLAND FERRY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. IT'S GOOD NEWS. MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE GAY NEWS IN A PLACE LIKE SYRIA A LITTLE MORE SOMBER.
A WELL-KNOWN FEMALE BLOGGER HAS ALLEGEDLY BEEN ABDUCTED IN SEARA. RELATIVES OF AMEENA ABDULLAH HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE SHE WAS BUNDZLED INTO A CAR YESTERDAY. HER BLOG "GAY GIRL IN DAMASCUS" HAS MADE HER A HERO OF THE UPRISING.
Jon: WOW, AN OPENLY GAY BLOGGER GIVING PRESIDENT ASAAD THE FINGER RIGHT UNDER HIS NOSE. THIS AMINA ABDULLAH HAS REAL BOLS.
OVER THE WEEKEND, 40-YEAR-OLD TOM McMASTER, AN AMERICAN BASED IN SCOTLAND, ADMITTED HE  WAS THE MAN BEHIND THE POPULAR BLOG "A GAY GIRL IN DAMASCUS."
THE WORDS OF A 40-YEAR-OLD MARRIED AMERICAN MAN WHO CLAIMS HE JUST WANTED A WESTERN  AUDIENCE TO CARE ABOUT THE STORY IN SYRIA.
Jon: LITERALLY, LITERALLY HAS BALLS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT THE HELL? THIS BRAVE, GAY, MISSING SYRIAN FREEDOM FIGHTER IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS. AND BY THE WAY, GAY GIRL IN DAMASCUS. THAT MAKES AMERICANS CARE NOR ABOUT THE STORY? HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN OUT OF OUR COUNTRY? TRY BLURRY PHOTO OF CONGRESSIONAL GENITALS IN DAMASCUS. NOW YOU HAVE OUR ATTENTION. [LAUGHTER] STILL, IT RAISES THE QUESTION, WHY CLAIM THAT THIS FAKE PERSON AMINA WAS KIDNAPPED, A STUNT THAT PUT REAL NON-MAIDUP SYRIANS  IN DANGER.
HE WAS GOING ON VACATION TO ISTANBUL AND SORT OF AS AN AWAY  NOTICE, HE HAS HER KIDNAPPED IN THE BLOG.
BECAUSE HE WAS GOING ON VACATION AND HE WANTED TO PUT IT ON HOLD FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
Jon: VACATION FROM WHAT? ARE YOU WORN OUT FROM SITTING IN YOUR APARTMENT ALL DAY PRETENDING TO BE A LESBIAN ON THE INTERNET? [LAUGHTER] WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO HAVE A COUPLE QUIET DAYS TO MYSELF IN MY APARTMENT LEZ BLOGGING. THOUGH THE HOAX FOOLED ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MEDIA A FEW HAD THEIR SUSPICIONS.
THE JOURNALIST WHO REALLY HELPED UNCOVER THIS WHOLE THING IS THIS GUY, ANDY CARVIN. HE'S A SENIOR STRATEGIST OVER AT NPR
Jon: THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW ABOUT FOLLOWING SOCIAL MEDIA.
WHEN DID YOU START "SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE" FISHY? WHEN DID YOU START SMELLING SOMETHING FISHY? [LAUGHTER] JANUARY
Jon: THAT ONE PHYSICALLY HURT. NOW I'M NOT GOING TO HEAR THE REST OF THE INTERVIEW OVER THE LOUD SOUND OF MY OWN CHILDISH SNICKERING. ACTUALLY, ONE CLUE TO AMINA'S TRUE IDENTITY WAS THE I.P. ADDRESS THAT SHE POSTED ON THE AMERICAN NEWS WEB SITE LEZ GET REAL, EDITED BY PAULA BROOKS, A  WIDOWED DEAF LESBIAN MOTHER OF TWO WHO TURNS OUT TO BE A DUDE, AS WELL. THIS GUY, 58-YEAR-OLD BILL GRAVER, A RETIRED OHIO MILITARY MAN AND CONSTRUCTION WORKER. SO NOW I'M COMPLETELY [BLEEPED] FREAKED OUT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LESBIANS WE CARED THE MOST ABOUT IN THE WORLD ARE DUDES. IF ELLEN DeGENERES TURNS OUT TO BE A LONELY 61-YEAR-OLD CATTLE RANCHER FROM WYOMING  NAMED DIRK CANYON, I AM NO LONGER DANCING ALONG WITH HER AT HOME. BECAUSE I DO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
