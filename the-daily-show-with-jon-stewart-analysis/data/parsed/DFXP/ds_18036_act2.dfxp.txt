(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: THANK YOU. THESE TIES ARE VERY IN. (LAUGHTER)  WINK! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. LET'S TURN OUR FOCUS TO EUROPE. REMEMBER THIS FELLA HERE OVER MY  SHOULDER THERE? SILVIO BERLUSCONI. A BILLIONAIRE PRIME MINISTER OF  ITALY ELECTED THREE TIMES EVEN  THOUGH AS THEY SAY IN ROME, HE WAS CORRUPT.
THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER IS  NO STRANGER TO SCANDAL. CHARGES OF BRIBERY, CORRUPTION  AND EMBEZZLEMENT.
OFFICIALLY GUILTY OF TAX  FRAUD.
SENTENCED TO NEWSHOUR YEARS  IN PRISON FOR TAX FRAUD.
A SERIAL FLANDERER.
TALES OF LAVISH ORGIES.
NOTORIOUS ALL NIGHT SO-CALLED  BUNGA-BUNGA PARTIES. PAYING FOR SEX WITH AN UNDERAGE  PROSTITUTE.
HE WAS SAYING HE COULD  HAVEN'T SEX WITH 11 WOMEN SO  INSTEAD HE HAD SEX WITH EIGHT  WOMEN. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: A MAN WHO HAD SEX WITH  EIGHT WOMEN. THAT'S THE WORST BOND VILLAIN  EVER! (LAUGHTER)  AND IF YOU PULL ONE OF THEM OFF,  YOU JUST GROW BACK. LAST NOVEMBER WITH THE ITALIAN  ECONOMY TANKING, VOTERS REPLACED  BERLUSCONI WITH HIS POLAR OPPOSITE, MARIO MONTI, AN  ACADEMIC ECONOMIST WHO PROMISED  TO BALANCE ITALY'S BOOKS WITH STRICT AUSTERITY MEASURES. THAT'S NOT AN EASY CHOICE. THE COUNTRY BASICALLY DECIDING  IT WOULD BE BETTER TO LIVE WITH  ITS HARD-ASS STEPFATHER EVEN THOUGH ITS REAL FATHER WAS  OUTSIDE REVVING UP HIS ALFA  ROMEO PROMISING TO TAKE EVERYONE TO A STRIP CLUB FOR PROSECCO AND  WAFFLES. (LAUGHTER)  OR WHATEVER BETTER VERSION OF  WAFFLES THEY HAVE IN ITALY. I'M SURE. REALLY? HIS ZELLS IS THAT WHAT THEY DO? (LAUGHTER)  LOOK AT THAT GRILL PATTERN. IT'S (BLEEP)ING BEAUTIFUL. HOW DO THEY DO IT? EVERYTHING YOU EAT IS BETTER  THERE. KOSHER HOT DOGS. THEY PROBABLY HAVE SOME KIND OF  THING THAT GETS SAYSLY AND BLUB  BLUB. ANYWAY, ITALY SUCKED IT UP AND  GOT THE FISCAL HOUSE IN BETTER  SHAPE, EVERYONE'S GLAD THEY DID WHAT THEY DID. ALMOST EVERYONE.
ONE OF ITALY'S MOST  CONTROVERSIAL FORMER LEADERS IS  EYEING A COMEBACK. BERLUSCONI SAYS HE'S PLANNING TO  RUN AGAIN. THIS WOULD BE HIS FOURTH TERM IN  OFFICE.
Jon: HE WAS CONVICTED --  (LAUGHTER). HE WAS CONVICTED OF TAX FRAUD  SIX WEEKS AGO. HE WAS SENTENCED TO NEWSHOUR  YEARS. NOW I UNDERSTAND HE'S APPEALING  THE SENTENCE AND THAT WITH TIME  OFF FOR AT LEAST GOOD BEHAVIOR HE COULD BE OUT IN LET'S SAY TWO  YEARS. WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THIS  SERIOUSLY?
MONTI ANNOUNCING HE'LL STEP  DOWN BEFORE HIS TERM ENDS. THE DECISION COMES AFTER THE  PARTY OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER  SILVIO BERLUSCONI WITHDREW ITS SUPPORT FOR MONTI'S GOVERNMENT  LAST WEEK.
Jon: HOLY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  HOW DOES THIS GUY DO THAT? ITALY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? BERLUSCONI DOESN'T EVEN WANT  THIS.
SPEAKING TO REPORTERS AT A  FOOTBALL MATCH HE SOUNDED ALMOST  RELUCTANT. "I'M RETURNING SADLY TO PUBLIC  SERVICE."  (LAUGHTER)  "AGAIN, I'M DOING IT OUT OF A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY."  (LAUGHTER)  STPHAOUD IF YOU HAD A SENSE OF  RESPONSIBILITY YOU WOULD HAVE STOPPED AT THE SEVENTH GIRL! YOU WENT EIGHT! WHEN HAS BERLUSCONI EVER  DISPLAYED A SENSE OF  RESPONSIBILITY? HIS FAMILY CREST IS A GUY  (BLEEP)ING IN A SWIMMING POOL! (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE GRAPHICS  TEAM ON THAT ONE. (LAUGHTER)  THEY'VE OUTDONE THEMSELVES. MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT MONTI,  FINE. BUT DOES THAT MEAN BERLUSCONI  HAS TO TAKE OVER? DON'T OFF FOOTBALL STAR? THAT GUY COULD BE IT. ROBERTO BENIGNI, HE'S SO FUN. MARIO! SUCH A GOOD DRIVER! IL DIVO, THERE'S FOUR OF THEM! THEY COULD SPLIT IT UP, FOR  GOD'S SAKES. THIS GUY IS UNBELIEVABLE. HE HAS TAKEN WHAT NORMALLY WOULD  BE ENOUGH OIL YEE GOTISM TO GET  HIM TO RUN FOR OFFICE MAYBE ONCE AND TURNED THAT INTO ENOUGH OIL  YEE GOTISM FOR FOUR SEPARATE  CAMPAIGNS. WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF A  CHANUKAH MIRACLE? THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE. HOW DOES HE WIN? HE'S GOT A IT WILL SOMETHING UP  HIS SLEEVE.
