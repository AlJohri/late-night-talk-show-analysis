( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE TURN OUR ATTENTION NOW, IF YOU PLEASE, TO THE NEWLY MINTED HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WHERE  THE G.O.P. RECENTLY UNVEILED THE HIGH SCHOOL ANTICIPATED FOLLOW-UP TO THEIR REPEAL THE  JOB KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW ACT. IT'S CALLEDLET "NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORNGZS ACT." IT SEEKS TO UNDO A  LONDONSTANDING COMPROMISE THAT ALLOWS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ABORTION IN EXTREME CASES LIKE RAPE. IN THE NEW BILL, FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ABORTIONS WOULD BE LIMITED TO CASES RESULTING FROM WHAT  THEY CALL FORCEABLE RAPE, WHICH COULD POSSIBLY EXCLUDE RAPES WHERE WOMEN HAVE BEEN DRUGGED OR  WOMEN WITH LIMITED MENTAL CAPACITY, OR STATUTORY RAPE, OR RAPED. FOR MORE ON THE LEGISLATIVE PUSH TO CLARIFY RAPE WE'RE JOINED BY  "DAILY SHOW" SENIOR WOMEN'S CORRESPONDENT, CRISTEN SCHAAL.
HALLELUJAH! BY PROPOSING THIS LEGISLATION REPUBLICANS ARE FINALLY CLOSING THE GLARING LOOPHOLE IN OUR  HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY DRUGS UNDERAGED OR MENTALLY  HANDICAPPED YOUNG WOMEN HAVE BEEN GAMING THE SYSTEM ( LAUGHTER ) SORRY, LADIES. THE FREE ABOGGS RIDE-- ABORTION RIDE IS OVER ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  CRISTEN, THE NOTION OF LIMITING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ABORTIONS OF VICTIMS OF  FORCEABLE RAPE, ALL RAPE IS BY DEFINITION FORCEABLE.
JON, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WORD "ALL."  IN TRUTH, THERE'S A WHOLE RAINBOW OF RAPE COVERING A WIDE SPECTRUM OF GRAY AREAS, LIKE  STATUTORY RAPE, SOMETHING WHOOPI GOLDBERG EXPLAINED IN THE ROMAN POLANSKI CASE.
HE'S A WONDERFUL DIRECTOR BUT HE DID RAPE A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD.
HE WAS NOT CHARGED-- I KNOW IT WASN'T RAPE-RAPE.
SEE? THERE'S RAPE, AND THERE'S RAPE-RAPE. OKAY? PLYING A 13-YEAR-OLD CAN QUAALUDES, ALCOHOL, AND A FAMOUS  PENIS ISN'T RAPE-RAPE, IT'S JUST RAPE-ESQUE. AND SHOULD SHOULDN'T BE COVER-UPPED, ONLY RAPE-RAPE.
Jon:  ONLY RAPE-RAPE IS COVERED. WHAT OTHER NON-RAPE-RAPE-BASED ABURKESES WOULD BE COVER-UPPED OR NOT BE COVERED I SHOULD SAY?
GIVE ME A HYPOTHETICAL.
Jon:  ARE DRUNK WOMEN WHO ARE RAPED COVERED?
WELL, WERE THEY DRESSED SHUTE? WAS IT A BACHLORETTE PARTY, LOCAL BAR? I MEAN...
Jon:  DOES IT MATTER?
YES! BECAUSE THAT DETERMINES WHAT IS RAPE-RAPE AND WHAT IS MERELY RAPE-ISH, AND I DON'T THINK  HARD-EARNED TAX DOLLARS SHOULD GO TO WOMEN WHO ARE ONLY BEEN RAPE-ISHED.
Jon:  WHAT IF YOU'RE DATE RAPED? WHAT IF YOU'RE RAPED BY A FRIEND?
AH! THAT'S CLASSIFIED NOW AS RAPE WITH BENEFITS. BY THE WAY, HOLLYWOOD, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR NEXT BIG ROMANTIC COMEDY, YOU CAN'T DO  ANY BRNL THAT. BETTER THAN THAT.
Jon:  WHAT IF THE WOMAN IS UNCONSCIOUS? WOULD THEY COVER THAT?
THEY'D LIKE TO, JON, BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE RAPE. THE WOMAN MIGHT BE HAVING A RAPE-MARE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS CONGRESS IS REDEFINING RAIN TO PROTECT US FROM THE WORST KIND OF RAPE.
Jon:  AND-- AND WHAT IS THAT?
MONEY RAPE.
Jon:  WHAT IS MONEY RAPE? THAT'S FORCEABLE TAKING OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY TO PAY FOR ABORTIONS. THEY HAVE NO SAY IN THE PARTY. THEY JUST HAVE TO LAY BACK AND TAKE IT WHILE THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS ARE VIOLATED OVER AND  OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
Jon:  HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE EVEN TALKING ABOUT HERE?
WELL, IN 2006 ALONE, FEDERAL FUNDS HELPED PAY FOR 191 ABORTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE, INCEST, OR WHEN THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER IS AT RISK. SO THAT WORKS OUT TO... .2 OF A PENNY PER TAXPAYER. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  KRISTIN PEOPLE'S TAXES GO TOWARDS THING THEY  DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THE TIME. I DIDN'T SUPPORT THE IRAQ WAR BUT MY TAXES STILL HELPED PAY FOR IT.
THAT'S WAR ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  REALLY? BECAUSE I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IGHT HAVE JUST BEEN WAR-ISH?M ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( LAUGHTER )
JON! THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS WAR-ISH. YOU'RE NOT MAKING SENSE. CLEARLY, YOU'VE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY YEARS OF MONEY RAPE. LOOK, I KNOW IT HURTS, BUT IT'S OKAY TO TALK ABOUT IT.
Jon:  KRISTIN, I'M FINE. IT JUST DOESN'T--
SHOW ME ON THE PIGGY BANK WHERE OBAMA TOOK YOUR MONEY FOR ABORTIONS ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  KRISTIN I DIDN'T--
RIGHT HERE? NO? DID HE DRAW A HOLE BACK HERE?
