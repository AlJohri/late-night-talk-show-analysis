Jon: WELCOME BACK. EVERYBODY KNOWS NEW POPE FRANCIS IS A HUMBLER, GENTLER POPE. WITH THE WASHING OF HIS FOLLOWERS' FEET, THE SLEEPING IN A SMALL APARTMENT, REFUSING TO USE THE POPEMOBILE WHEN COMMUTING, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. BOTTOM LINE IS THIS NEW POPE IS SUPERCHILLIN TOTES LOW KEY. UNLIKE THE LAST POPE CAPTAIN FLASHY PANTS WITH HIS LAS VEGAS STYLE INTRO MUSIC. â™ª .
Jon: THAT IS KIND OF COOL. I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE DIGGING THIS NEW POPE.
IN THE SIX MONTHS HE'S BEEN POPE, CROWDS HAVE QUADRUPLED DRAWN BY HIS WARM AND WELCOMING STYLE AND A NEW OPENNESS.
Jon: IT'S POPE MANIA. AND HIS FIRST ALBUM HASN'T EVEN DROPPED YET. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS THIS FRANCIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF POPE. BUT I DON'T THINK UNTIL RECENTLY WE KNEW JUST HOW DIFFERENT.
ON THE ONCE TABOO SUBJECT OF HOMOSEXUALITY FRANCIS TOLD REPORTERS IF SOMEONE IS GAY AND SEARCHES FOR THE LORD AND HAS GOODWILL, WHO AM I TO JUDGE.
THE POPE IS REACHING OUT TO ATHEISTS AND AGNOSTICS. POPE FRANCIS SAYS GOD WILL FORGIVE THEM IF THEY LIVE MORALLY AND FOLLOW THEIR CONSCIENCE.
A TOP AID TO POPE FRANCIS DID HINT THAT THE CHURCH COULD REEVALUATE ITS POLICY ON PRIESTLY CELIBACY.
Jon: I LOVE THIS GUY. SO TO SUM IT UP, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. GAYS ARE COOL, PRIESTS CAN GET MARRIED AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD TO GET INTO HEAVEN. WHAT EXACTLY OF CATHOLICISM IS LEFT. YOU TAKE AWAY JESUS AND CELIBACY, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS JUST AN ORNATE RESTAURANT THAT ONLY SERVES WAFERS. I MEAN IT'S-- IT'S LIKE CATHOLICISM'S CORE TENET IS SUDDENLY-- YOU DO YOU, THAT'S ALL. (APPLAUSE) BUT IF YOU ARE OLD SCHOOL, AND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT, DON'T CALL POPE FRANCIS. HE'LL CALL YOU.
RECENTLY FRANCIS REACHED OUT TO THE FAITHFUL IN A SURPRISING WAY.
NOW HE'S TAKING TO PICKING UP THE PHONE AND CALLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE BLUE.
Jon: BY THE WAY, IF THE POPE CALLS THE WRONG NUMBER, DOES HE ADMIT IT. OR DOES HE SAY YOU KNOW, DOES HE SAY SORRY, HOLY FATHER YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER. DOES HE SAY NO, I'M INFALLABLE. YOU'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE. SO WHO-- WHO HAS THE POPE BEEN TALKING TO?
A WOMAN WHO SAID SHE FEARED RETALIATION AFTER REPORTING BEING RAPED BY A POLICEMAN-- .
Jon: WOW, THAT'S INTENSE. I'M GLAD THAT THE POPE WAS THERE FOR HER.
A MAN ANGRY WITH GOD AFTER HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN MURDERED.
Jon: I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE PAIN, GREAT WORK.
ANOTHER YOUNG MAN WORRIED ABOUT FINDING A JOB AFTER HE GRADUATED. (LAUGHTER) OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW TO DO YOUR JOB. BUT THAT LAST ONE SOUNDS LIKE A BISHOP LEVEL CALL. (LAUGHTER) I'M GLAD YOU'RE REACHING OUT. THERE IS A PRETTY STEEP DROP OFF BETWEEN DEATH AS A PART OF LIFE AND HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT AN INTERNSHIP? (LAUGHTER) I GOT TO SAY, I KIND OF FEEL BAD FOR FRANCIS' PREDECESSOR POPE BENEDICT WHO AS YOU REMEMBER IS STILL ALIVE AND I BELIEVE LIVING INSIDE THE VATICAN. I MEAN HE HAS TO SIT THERE AND WATCH POPE FRANCIS CRUSH IT.
I QUITE AGREE, JOHN. I QUITE AGREE. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
Jon: HOW DID YOU --
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS SO SAD, ISN'T IT JOHN, TO SEE AN OLD MAN DECADES PAST HIS PRIME BE BESTED BY A NEWER, FRESHER FACE, A FACE BATHED IN THE LIGHT OF AN ADORING AND OCCASIONALLY QUADRUPLED AUDIENCE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.
Jon: WHAT?
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, AN OLD MAN, JON, WHILE THE OLD MAN WITHERS COLD AND ALONE DIRECTING A MOVIE IN JORDAN. POOR BENEDICT.
Jon: I DON'T RECALL THE POPE DIRECTING A MOVIE.
OH, OOPSY, MY MISTAKE. PERHAPS I'M THINKING OF ANOTHER SIMILAR YET EQUALLY AS INEVITABLE SITUATION.
Jon: WHAT!
OH, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING, JON. PERHAPS WHAT YOU HEARD WAS MERELY THE SWEEPING WINDS OF TIME, WASHING AWAY THE OLD, USHERING IN THE NEW. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DID YOU GET BACK THERE?
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE, JON. WAITING, JUST WAITING AND BY HERE I MEAN LITERALLY OVER HERE LIKE-- SIX FEET AWAY FROM YOU, JON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIX FEET AWAY FROM YOU.
Jon: I'M JUST GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL THEN, IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST GOING GO TO COMMERCIAL.
HELLO, JON, YES, HELLO.
Jon: WHAT? I'M JUST GOING GO TO COMMERCIAL THEN.
OH, A COMMERCIAL, FINE, GOOD IDEA, ONE OF US WILL BE RIGHT BACK. FOR NOW. MAHA HA, MAHA HA HA.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IS THAT-
