Stephen: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. SO THE FINANCIAL APOCALYPSE WAS AVERTED. NO APOCALYPSE FINANCIALINGY. WHAT ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL APOCALYPSE. CAN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SAVE US? NO. A *EUS.
WIND MAY FINALLY DO THE WORLD SOME GOOD AS A PROPOSED WIND FARM IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES  WILL DBREN RATE ENOUGH ENERGY TO POWER 35,000 HOMES.
THE LAND WIND PROJECT IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENERGY CONSUMER.
COULD YOU SAY THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A ROTE RESPONSE GIVEN TO YOU BY CORPORATE OVERLORDS?
SUGARLAND WIND IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY, AND IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENERGY CONSUMER.
IT SOUNDS IDEAL BUT OF COURSE, THE TREE HUGGING HIPPY CONSERVATIONS HAVE A PROBLEM.
THE LOCATION IS RIGHT SMACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THREE LARGEST  CONCENTRATIONS OF DUCKS IN SOUTH FLORIDA. THESE TURBINES WILL KILL DUCKS AND IN THE FALL OF WINTER AND WE GET A TREMENDOUS MIGRATION OF DUCKS.
YOU ARE SAYING DUCKS MIGRATE TOLL FLORIDA AND THEN THEY'LL DIE?
YES.
DUCKS WILL BE COMING TO FLORIDA TO DIE PUTTING THEM IN THE SAME RECAROUS POSITION AS --  PRECARIOUS POSITION AS THE MANATEE AND THE NORTHERN -- NORTH AMERICAN GRANDPARENTS.
HE WANTS YOU TO STOP KILLING THE BIRDS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO HIM?
ISN'T HE A PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT HUNTS DUCKS.
THE WATER FOULERS CONSERVATIONISTS.
ISN'T PART OF THEIR CHARTER TO HUNT DUCKS AS WELL?
I'M CONFUSED. WHAT DOES YOUR GROUP DO EXACTLY?
OUR MISSION IS TO MAKE DUCK HUNTING IN FLORIDA BETTER FOR FLORIDA DUCK HUNTERS.
I THOUGHT YOU WANT TO SAVE THE DUCKS.
WE WANT TO SAVE THE DUCKS SO WE CAN HUNT THE DUCKS.
YOU WANT TO SAVE THE DUCKS NOW SO YOU CAN KILL THEM LATER.
WE PRESERVE THE WORD HARVEST.
OH. ARE YOU WILLING TO ADMIT THAT YOUR WIND FARMS WILL BE HARVESTING THOUSANDS OF DUCKS.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
NOT HARVESTING BUT JUST LIKE SLAUGHTER BEGUN.
BASED ON A NATIONAL AVERAGE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE  UNITED STATES IS BASICALLY THREE BIRDS PERTURB YIEN FOR -- PER TUR TURBINE ARE KILLED.
IS THERE A NUMBER THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO YOU OF HOW MANY DUCKS ARE KILLED.
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WANTS TO SEE ONE DUCK KILLED BY A WHIRLING TURBINE.
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE IT KWEULD A SHOT -- KILLED WITH A SHOTGUN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU ARE LIKE THE SERIAL KILLER.
YOU ARE LIKE THE JAPANESE DOLPHIN HUNTER ANGRY AT THE TUNA NET.
THAT IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE AGAIN THE DOLPHIN GETS INTO THE TUNA NET IS WASTED.
THE REAL VICTIMS ARE NOT DOLPHIN SIEWSH SUSHI LOVERS BUT DUCK HUNTERS. MOST ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT.
HOW WILL THIS PROJECT AFFECT YOUR LIFESTYLE?
IT WILL BE TERRIBLE. I CAN'T KILL A DUCK THAT IS ALREADY DEAD.
THAT DOES SOUND TERRIBLE.
(bleep) YOU NO GOOD TREACHEROUS MEXICAN.
I'M ACTUALLY INDIAN.
(bleep). [LAUGHTER]
AS THE DUCK HUNTERS HABITAT IS SLOWLY ENCROACHED UPON BY A MORE EFFICIENT DUCK KILLING  MACHINE, ONE THING IS CLEAR:  WOULD YOU SAY IN THIS INSTANCE THE HUNTER HAS BECOME THE HUNTED?
I WOULD SAY THAT THE HUNTER WAS NOT CONSIDERED IN THIS PLAN. HUNTERS, NOT THE HUNTED, BECAUSE THE HUNTER WILL NOT BE HIT TO THE TURBINES.
I THINK IF YOU SAY THAT IT WOULD BRING A TEAR TO PEOPLE'S EYES. THE HUNTER HAS BEEN HUNTED.
SEMANTICALLY IT'S NOT TRUE.
IF YOU WANT THINGS TO CHANGE SAY THE HUNTER HAS BECOME THE HUNTED.
GREAT TV. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT.
WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO SAY IT. DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES THE HUNTER HAS BECOME THE HUNTED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THANK
