Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IS REALLY NOT A PROBLEM WHEN IT DOESN'T EFFECT YOU BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF IT DOES? JORDAN KLEPPER HAS THE TERRIFYING ANSWER.
PRISTINE CHEMICAL VALLEY WEST VIRGINIA IS THE HEART OF AMERICA'S COAL INDUSTRY AND PROBUSINESS ANTI-REGULATION CONSERVATIVES HAVE LONG FOUGHT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY. BUT NOW, STRANGELY ONE CONSERVATIVE HAS BROKEN RANKS. REPUBLICAN DELEGATE CINDY FRICH.
WE NEED TO HAVE REASONABLE REGULATIONS ON EVERY INDUSTRY.
YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN AND YOU'RE PUSHING TO REGULATE THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY?
YES.
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER.
THERE WAS. I HOPE IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.
WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST CHEMICAL  CONTAMINATIONS OF A WATER SUPPLY IN U.S. HISTORY.
200,000 PEOPLE ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND WATER TO DRINK AFTER A MASSIVE CHEMICAL SPILL.
THE CAUSE OF PREDICABLE AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE COUPLED WITH LAX REGULATIONS BUT THE EFFECT WAS SHOCKING.
I DRANK THE WATER AND IT TASTED FUNNY.
SO YOU INGESTED A CHEMICAL AND IT TURNED YOU INTO A DEMOCRAT?
I'M STILL A REPUBLICAN.
A REPUBLICAN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY FOUGHT AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS BUT NOW MIRACULOUSLY WANTS REGULATIONS. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
BREAK DOWN THAT DAY FOR US.
WELL, THAT DAY I STAYED PROBABLY UNTIL AFTER 5:00 AT THE CAPITAL. I CAME BACK TO MY HOTEL ROOM. OF COURSE I STARTING USING THE GLASS WEAR AND DRINKING THE WATER FROM THE TAP. IT DID TASTE BAD. I FELT A LIGHT HEADED AND MY THROAT HAD STARTED BURNING AFTER I DRANK THE WATER. SO, I KEPT CLEANING IT OUT AND DRINKING IT AGAIN.
YOU DRANK IT AGAIN?
RIGHT.
TWO TIMES?
I DID. WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY ROOM, I STILL HAD A GLASS. THERE WAS STILL SOME OF THAT WATER IN IT. I MEAN, I NATURALLY TOOK THE WATER AND DRANK IT.
A THIRD TIME.
YES.
DID YOU EVER THINK MAYBE I'LL JUST GO BUY A BOTTLE OF WATER?
I THOUGHT I WOULD GO SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY HAD BOTTLED WATER, SO I WENT UPSTAIRS AND HAD SOME SOUP.
YOU KNOW THERE'S WATER IN SOUP, RIGHT?
YES.
AS I CHILD DID YOU EVER PUT YOUR HAND IN FIRE, REALIZE IT HURT AND THEN THINK TO MYSELF I'M GOING TO DO THIS TWO MORE TIMES AND THEN PUT MY HAND IN SOUP FIRES?
WELL, UM --
WITH POISON SOUP WATER COURSING THROUGH HER VEINS A TRANSFORMATION OCCURRED. JUST LIKE IN THE 80s CULT FILM THE TOXIC AVENGER, EXPOSURE TO TOXIC WASTE TURNED AN UNSUSPECTING DELEGATE INTO A MUTANT ECOFREAK.
I LOVE ORIGIN STORIES. [LAUGHTER]
I'M NOT RADIOACTIVE.
WAS FRITCH THE ONLY LEGISLATOR WHO HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THIS CHEMICAL? I SAT DOWN WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE KANAWHA-CHARLESTON HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
THE WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE AND ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT WAS IN TOWN AT THE TIME THIS EVENT OCCURRED.
THEY ALL GOT CONTAMINATED?
THEY WERE ALL IMPACTED.
AND THE RESULTS WERE TRAGIC, FOR INDUSTRY.
THE STATE LEGISLATURE JUST PASSED SENATE BILL 373 THAT PROVIDES PROTECTION TO WATER RESOURCES.
WHAT CHEMICAL HAD THE CAPACITY TO MUTATE THE ENTIRE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF WEST VIRGINIA.
ITS 4-METHYLCYCLOHEXANEMETHANOL. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD SYMPTOMS SUCH AS NAUSEA, DIZZINESS,.
MILD CASE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY? A LITTLE RASH OF REASON?
YEAH. PEOPLE'S OWN FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WERE IMPACTED.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A REAL FIMBY ISSUE?
WHAT IS FIMBY.
(bleep) IT'S IN MY BACKYARD.
SO, WILL THE EFFECTS OF THIS CHEMICAL SPILL PERMANENTLY CHANGE WEST VIRGINIA POLITICS? THANKFULLY NOT. CASE IN POINT, HOUSE BILL 2579, WHICH ACTUALLY LOOSENS STANDARDS ON THE AMOUNT OF TOXIC SELENIUM COAL COMPANIES CAN DUMP INTO THE WATER. WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART?
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT REGULATIONS THAT ARE FORCING WEST VIRGINIANS TO SHUT DOWN OUR COAL FIRE POWER PLANTS.
SO, YOU WANT TO REGULATE THINGS LIKE CHEMICALS IN THE WATER UNLESS THOSE CHEMICALS ARE SELENIUM.
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M COMFORTABLE EVEN -- I SHOULDN'T EVEN SAY THIS IN FRONT OF A CAMERA.
IT'S OKAY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT EITHER.
SO, DON'T WORRY, WEST VIRGINIA YOUR WATER IS STILL SAFE FROM BEING TOO CLEAN.
JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
