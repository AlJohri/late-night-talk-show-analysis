FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY GUEST TONIGHT, VERY EXCITING, LEGAL SCHOLAR CASS SUNSTEIN IS GOING TO BE HERE, HE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "WISER," WHICH I THINK YOU WILL BE ONCE YOU READ IT. BUT FIRST, VERY BIG DAY IN WASHINGTON.
AN HISTORIC DAY ON CAPITOL HILL AS THE 114th CONGRESS MEETS FOR THE FIRST TIME. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THE CONGRESS MET FOR THE FIRST TIME, RIGHT ON A TUESDAY, A TUESDAY. COULDN'T GO BACK TO WORK ON A MONDAY? WHY WOULD YOU GO BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY? MONDAY WAS KAMAKURA JAPAN'S FESTIVAL OF JOMA SHINJI. YOU COULDN'T WORK ON THAT DAY OR IT WAS THE 12th DAY OF CHRISTMAS. IF YOU'RE NOT HOME TO SIGN FOR YOUR DELIVERY OF 12 DRUMMERS DRUMMING. YOU KNOW, FEDEX JUST LEAVES THEM ON YOUR DOORSTEP. OF COURSE, YOU CAN'T -- COME ON, CONGRESS! YOUR FIRST DAY BACK FROM THE HOLIDAY BREAK IS A TUESDAY? EVEN WE CAME BACK ON MONDAY, AND WE'RE SO LAZY, DOT, DOT, DOT. ( LAUGHTER ) NOBODY-- NOBODY FINISHED WRITING THAT? THEY JUST --  ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD PREMISE. THERE'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW WHAT, I'D FIRE THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY DIDN'T WORK ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR AND I'D HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY UP THERE... ( LAUGHTER ) ALL RIGHT, CONGRESS TOOK AN EXTRA DAY OF VACATION. FINE. BUT ONCE TUESDAY ROLLED AROUND, BAM! CRACK OF DAWN, NATION'S BUSINESS, GAVEL IT IN.
MANY LAWMAKERS HAVE UNTIL NOON TO MAKE IT TO THE HILL. THAT'S WHEN THE 114th CONGRESS WILL BE SWORN IN.
Jon:  ARE YOU BLEEP SERIOUS? ( LAUGHTER ) NOON! YOU HAD TO GET THERE AT NOON. YOU KNOW WHAT? NORMALLY THAT WOULD MAKE ME MAD BUT SINCE CONGRESS PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO BE DOING ANYTHING ANYWAY, ALL RIGHT, WHY NOT GET A LATE START? HELL, WHY NOT JUST SERVE THEM LEGISLATION IN BED FOR GOD'S SAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) NO WONDER YOU FOLKS HAVE A 14% APPROVAL RATING. AND APPARENTLY A ROUGHLY 95% INCUMBENCY RATE. YOU KNOW, 14% DISAPPROVAL TO 95% INCUMBENCY, IT'S THE SAME DISAPPROVAL-TO-RECURRENCE RATIO CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY THE HERPES VIRUS. HERPES-- IT'S LIKE CONGRESS ON YOUR DICK. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) WHAT'S THAT? IS THAT THE ARBY'S FONT? THAT'S JUST A CHEAP SHOT. SO OTHER THAN THE REPUBLICANS NOW TAKING CONTROL OF THE SENATE, AS WELL AS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, NOTHING MUCH HAS CHANGED ON CAPITOL HILL. EXCEPT ON ME, GOD! THAT'S A KORAN! THEY'RE SWEARING IN ON A KORAN. OH, NO, NO, WAIT. CHRISTIAN BIBLE. CHRISTIAN BIBLE.  EVERYBODY, LOOKS LIKE WE'VE STAVED OFF THE THREAT OF SHARIA LAW FOR MAYBE ONE MORE CONGRESSIONAL SEASON, BUT IT'S COMING. ALL RIGHT THE SENATE CHANGED HANDS, IT'S BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN BEFORE. AND NOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS HOLD THE NATION'S MOST DELIBERATIVE BODY, TO WHAT LOFTY GOALS DOES THE SENATE ASPIRE?
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER INCOMING MITCH McCONNELL SAID TO THE "WASHINGTON POST" THAT HE WANTS REPUBLICANS TO NOT APPEAR SCARY, HIS WORDS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  SURE WOULDN'T WANT TO -- SURE WOULDN'T WANT TO STARTLE FOLKS. ( LAUGHTER ) WITH ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) OH LOOK AT THAT, HE'S WEARING HIS -- THAT'S EXCITING. HE'S WEARING HIS-- HE'S WEARING HIS FESTIVE SWEARING IN SHELL. IT'S A REPLICA OF THE ROTUNDA. CAPITOL DOME. WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE, A PARTY CHANGE WILL AT LEAST BRING SOME FRESH NEW BLOOD TO SENATE LEADERSHIP. NEW FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIR WILL BE-- 80-YEAR-OLD ORRIN HATCH. THE NEW JUDICIARY CHAIR WILL BE 81-YEAR-OLD CHUCK GRASSLEY. THE NEW ARMED SERVICES CHAIR, 78-YEAR-OLD JOHN McCAIN. THE NEW AGRICULTURE CHAIR, 78-YEAR-OLD PAT ROBERTS. AND FINALLY, NEW ENVIRONMENT CHAIR, 80-YEAR-OLD JAMES INHOFE. WHY DO I GET THE IDEA THESE CHAIRS ARE MOTORIZED AND SLOWLY ASCEND STAIRCASES. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO! NO! NO! I'M NOT GOING TO BE AGEIST. MAYBE THESE YOUNG WHIPPER SNAPPERS HAVE FRESH NEW IDEAS LIKE THE NEW ENVIRONMENT CHAIR INHOFE.
THE ASSERTION THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS OCCURRING TODAY, THAT IT'S OCCURRING BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF C.O.2. I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S THE GREATEST HOAX EVER PERPETRATED ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon:  WE ARE DOOMED! NOW, WAIT, IN HIS DEFENSE, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVABLE IN GLOBAL WARMING WHEN YOU ALWAYS FEEL DRAFTY. ( LAUGHTER ) NOW IT'S TOO HOT. BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE CRUSTY OLD SENATE, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WHERE TWO-TIME HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER BECAME THREE-TIME HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER AFTER FENDING OFF A MINOR CHALLENGE FROM... AN IDIOT. BOEHNER GAVELED -- OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD, JOHN BOEHNER HAS BECOME THE WOOD OF HIS OWN GAVEL! ( LAUGHTER ) JOHN BOEHNER-- HE-- HE IS GROOT. HE IS GROOT. ( APPLAUSE ) WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT. YOUR NEW HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, SMOOTH SAILING FOR THEM FROM HERE ON OUT.
REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE IS FACING BACKLASH AFTER IT WAS REVEALED HE SPOKE BEFORE A WHITE SUPREMACIST ORGANIZATION IN 2002.
Jon: OH REALLY, A LITTLE BACKLASH? WELL, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT WITH A LITTLE HISTORICAL CONTENT. I MEAN, BACK IN 2002, I MEAN, BACK THEN, THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HAD ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. GOOD LUCK SPINNING YOUR WAY OUT OF THIS ONE, SCALISE.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHO THAT GROUP WAS BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ABOUT THEM THEY DON'T REPRESENT THE VALUES THAT I REPRESENT. I DETEST HATE GROUPS OF ANY KIND.
Jon:  SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE TALKING TO A WHITE SUPREMACIST GROUP? WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS JUST AN ODDLY MUSIC-LESS TOGA PARTY?
HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW? THE GROUP WAS FOUNDED BY FORMER KU KLUX KLAN GRAND WIZARD DAVID DUKE. CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS CALLED DUKE'S ORGANIZATION A LEADING HATE GROUP.
Jon:  YES, IT'S ONE OF THE LEADING, IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE TOP HATE GROUPS. IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE SAFETY HATE GROUPS PEOPLE DON'T GET IN WHEN THEY DON'T HATE WELL ENOUGH. AND BY THE WAY, THAT'S NO BULL (BLEEP) RANKINGS. THOSE RANKINGS ARE DETERMINED BY J.D. WHITE POWER AND ASSOCIATES. SO THE REPUBLICANS, THEY HAVE SOME ISSUES, BUT WITH THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO COMMAND THEY CAN FINALLY RAMP THEIR AGENDA UP AND GET IT THROUGH.
EXPECT PRESIDENT OBAMA TO DUST OFF THE VETO PEN. HE'S ONLY USED IT TWICE. THAT'S THE LEAST OF ANY PRESIDENT IN 130 YEARS SINCE JAMES GARFIELD. BUT GARFIELD HAD A PRETTY GOOD REASON FOR NOT ISSUING ANY VETOES. HE WAS SHOT JUST FOUR MONTHS INTO OFFICE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: WHAT? PRETTY GOOD REASON? YOU HAVE A HIGH VETO BAR, MY FRIEND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
