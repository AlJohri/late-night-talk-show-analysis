JUNE 1, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT, THE GREAT BILL MOYERS WILL BE JOINING US, ONE OF THE FEW LEGENDS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING NOT MADE OF FOAM RUBBER. PERHAPS YOU SAW ME ON MOYERS' SHOW. LAST NIGHT WE TOOK A MEASURED LOOK. GOD, THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO COVER THIS WEINER STORY. ALL RIGHT. FINE. I GUESS [BLEEPED] WAS TAKEN. ANYWAY, THE UPSHOT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY STRANGE STORY. CONGRESSMAN POSSIBLY TWEETED A PICTURE OF HIS JOHN OR HAD HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT HACKED AND A  PICTURE OF HIS JUNK SENT OR A PICTURE OFcLINE IS THEREe1 WAS A JUNK SH  ODDLY ENOUGH, IT'S ALSO THE NAME NAME OF WHAT WAS USED TO CLOG THE GULF OIL LEAK. ALSO HE'S A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. I WAS HOPING HE'D HAVE A VERY CLEAR AND STRONG EXPLANATION  THAT HASN'T NECESSARILY HAPPENED SO FAR. BUT AFTER SAYING THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO COMMENT ON THE SITUATION, HE'S DIDN'T A FEW  INTERVIEWS THIS AFTERNOON. OBVIOUSLY TOO LATE IN THE DAY FOR US TO REALLY SINK OUR TEETH... [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, THERE'S NO... IT'S TOO LATE IN THE GAME FOR US TO SUCK HIS [BLEEPED]. WHY RUN FROM IT? FINE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE CAN'T SHOW YOU A -- WE CAN SHOW YOU A QUICK SNIPPET.
I DIDN'T SEND THAT PICTURE OUT.
BUT THAT'S NOT A PICTURE OF YOU MANY
I CAN'T SAY WITH CERTAINTUDE. MY SYSTEM WAS HACKED. PICTURES CAN BE MANIPULATED. PICTURES CAN BE DROPPED IN AND INSERTED. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS THAT CLEARS THAT UP. YOU KNOW, I'M NOT CERTAIN ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. THERE ARE THREE THINGS IN THIS WORLD THAT I DO HAVE CERTAINTUDE ON. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK IS THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] O.J. KILLED THOSE TWO PEOPLE. AND THE THIRD ONE IS WHAT MY ERECT PENIS LOOKS LIKE IN MY OWN UNDERWEAR. [APPLAUSE] I WILL TELL YOU THIS: I KNOW."| MY PENIS LIKE THE FRONT OF MY HAND  THAT I USE TO GET TO KNOW MY PENIS. [LAUGHTER] SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS THING'S GOING THE PLAY OUT, BUT  OBVIOUSLY WE'LL KEEP YOU APPEAR APPEAR -- APPEAR NIS OF ANY NEW THINGS GOING ON.
DAY THREE OF SARAH'S ONE NATION US WITH TOUR, SHE MET WITH DONALD TRUMP ON HIS HOME  TURF RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, SHE'S HERE! SHE'S IN THE HOUSE? WITH HIM? WOW, THIS BRINGS UP SO MANY QUESTIONS. WHOSE NAME WILL THEY PUT ON THE VEHICLE THEY TRAVEL IN? HMMM. WILL THEY CALL IT TRAILING PALUMP? WHAT WILL THEY CALL IT. SO TRUMP'S SHOWING PALIN THE TOWN. I'M SURE HE TOOK HER TO SOME SAVVY PLACE LIKE THE TRUMP ALL YOU CAN EAT CAVIAR, TRUMP FOIE  GRAS CAFETERIA, WHERE YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO CONTRACT GOUT, THE DISEASE OF KINGS.
DO YOU FEEL BROKE? THEY WENT OUT FOR A SLICE OF PIZZA IN NEW YORK'S TIMES SQUARE.
Jon: SLICE OF PIZZA. RESPECT.
THE PLACE IS CALLED FAMOUS FAMIGLIA PIZZA, AN ALBANIAN CHAIN OF PIZZERIA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT? FAMOUS FAMIGLIA IS ON 50th AN BROADWAY. I'VE EATEN THERE, THAT PIZZA IS FINE. I USED TO EAT THERE A LOT WHEN I WAS WORKING NEXT DOOR AT CAROLINE'S COMEDY CLUB. IT'S GOOD CONVENIENCE PIZZA. BACK IN THE '08s THERE WEREN'T A LOT OF FOOD OPTIONS. IT WAS FAMIGLIA'S PIZZA OR EDIBLE UNDERWEAR FROM ONE OF THE PORN SHOPS. GIULIANI TOOK THAT OPTION AWAY. YOU KNOW, DONALD, I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT IF YOU'RE  TAKING AN ESTEEMED VISITOR TO GET REAL NEW YORK PIZZA, FAMIGLIA'S AIN'T IT.
IT WAS GREAT. WASN'T THAT GOOD? IT WAS REAL NEW YORK PIZZA.
Jon: NO! NO! IT'S NOT! UNLESS REAL AUTHENTIC NEW YORK PIZZA CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN TERMINAL FOUR OF THE PHOENIX AIRPORT. GOVERNOR PALIN NEW YORK DISRESPECT TO YOU, YOU'RE A GUEST IN OUR CITY, WE SHOULD  OFFER YOU THE FINEST THAT OUR HOSPITALITY HAS TO OFFER YOU. I JUST WOULD HAVE THOUGHT CAPTAIN COMBOVER COULD HAVE PULLED THAT ONE OFFER. I MEAN, FOR [BLEEPED] SAKE, IT'S NEW YORK CITY. I HATE TO USE THIS TERM THIS CLOSE TO GROUND ZERO, BUT WE'RE  A BIT OF A PIZZA MI MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU  LOMBARDI'S... [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HONESTLY, LOMBARDI'S.

GO TO THE ONE ON BLEECKER'S. THAT'S FULL. BUT THE PIES, MMM. DENINO'S ON STATEN ISLAND, THE BRED CRUMBS ON THE ISLAND. GO TO JOSEPH'S. [BLEEPED]. I GET IT. I GET IT. [APPLAUSE] YOU'RE IN A HURRY. MAYBE THERE'S SECURITY CONCERNS. I'LL FORGIVE YOU THE SELECTION. I APOLOGIZE. LET'S JUST GO TO THE CONTENT OF YOUR MEETING AND THEN WE'LL JUST -- SON OF A BITCH. YOU STAB YOUR SLICES, DONALD? WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU STAB SLICES OF PIZZA, THE STEAM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SLICE IS GOING  TO MAKE THE TOP CRUST [BLEEPED]. MAYBE ALL THOSE YEARS, ALL THOSE YEARS OF MAKING YOUR HAIR DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT IT DOES, YOU  THINK YOU CAN GO AROUND LAYERING ANY [BLEEPED] THING YOU WANT THE LAYER AND NO ONE IS GOING THE  SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IRTD, BUT YOU CANNOT. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, I APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZE. NO DISRESPECT. I APOLOGIZE. LET'S CONTINUE WITH THE MEETING. ARE YOU EATING IT WITH A FORK, A  [BLEEPED] FORK? AHHHH, NOOOOO! [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING GIBB IRISH] DONALD TRUMP, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THAT FORK AND STICK IT RIGHT IN NEW YORK'S EYE. DONALD TRUMP, WE WORK HARD. CAN YOU DO THIS? YOU DISRESPECT US IN OUR OWN HOUSE? YOU CAN FEW YOUR NAME ON EVERYTHING. YOU CAN BUILD YOUR [BLEEPED] GLASS AND GOLD-PAINT BUILDINGS TO THE SKY, BLOCKING OUT THE CENTRAL PARK SUN. IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE. BUT YOU INVITE AN IMPORTANT VISITOR TO OUR HOUSE AND OUR TOWN AND EAT YOUR PIZZA WITH A  FORK RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. WHO THE [BLEEPED] DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

IT'S DELICIOUS, YEAH, YEAH. TAKE CARE OF THAT. ALL RIGHT. VERY NICE. OR MAYBE YOU JUST USE YOUR OTHER HAND TO TAKE AN IRRESPONSIBLE AMOUNT OF NAPKIN, DAB IT ON. THERE AND MAYBE A FEW MINUTES LATER YOU JUST THROW THEM THE  [BLEEPED] OUT. YOU JUST THROW THEM OUT. OR YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE TABLE AND SAY, YOU WANT A TIP, HERE'S YOUR [BLEEPED] TIP. WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE, A [BLEEPED] BUS BOY? NO DISRESPECT. ACTUALLY, I WAS A BUS BOY. MY POINT IS THIS:  [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DONALD, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU A STORY, DONALD TRUMP, MY GRANDPARENTS IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY. MY GANN FARE WORKED AS A TAXI DRIVER IN BROOKLYN. MY OTHER GRANDFATHER WORKED AS A DRY CLEANER IN WASHINGTON HEIGHTS. I DO NOT COME FROM SUCCESSFUL STOCK.
