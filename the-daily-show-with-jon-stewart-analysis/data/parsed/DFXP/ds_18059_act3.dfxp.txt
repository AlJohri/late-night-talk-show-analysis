(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. THE ANCHOR OF ABC'S "GOOD  MORNING, AMERICA" AND THIS WEEK'  GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS. COME ON! (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YOU  Jon: I'M GREAT. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
GOOD TO SEE YOU. I WISH I COULD TALK TO MY  CORRESPONDENTS THE WAY YOU TALK  TO YOURS
Jon: DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD  ALSO HAVE THE TRAVEL BUDGET THAT  WE HAVE FOR OUR CORRESPONDENTS? WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING.
IT WOULD BE  Jon: DO YOU GUYS... IT IS A  CURIOUS THING. WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON TV, DO YOU  GUYS CURSE AT EACH OTHER? LIKE IS IT PLAYFUL? IS IT DIRTY? IS IT PROFANE?
ALL OF THE ABOVE  Jon: WHAT'S THE VIBE BEHIND  THE SCENES?
PRETTY FRIENDLY ACTUALLY. Jon: IS IT COMPETITIVE? I GET THE SENSE SOMETIMES WITH  NETWORK SHOWS THERE'S A CERTAIN  LIKE WE SAW THIS WHOLE THING... ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE TODAY  SHOW? THERE WAS A WHOLE THING ABOUT  THE POLITICS OF WHAT PEOPLE WERE  DOING. DO YOU FIND THAT THAT'S A...
THERE'S LIMITED AMOUNT OF AIR  TIME. EVERYBODY WANTS IT
Jon: EXCEPT FOR GEORGE  STEPHANAPOLOUS. MORE HOURS IN A WEEK THAN THERE  ARE HOURS IN A WEEK.
IT'S MY DAY OFF  Jon: IS IT REALLY YOUR DAY  OFF?
WELL, I'M HERE. Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE  BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO DISCUSS  WORLD ISSUES.
OF COURSE. Jon: I GOT NOTHING. ARE YOU GOING TO THE  INAUGURATION? NOT THE INAUGURATION, THE STATE  OF THE UNION
FLY TO WASHINGTON RIGHT  AFTER.
Jon: NOW, FOR YOU, DO YOU  HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS, HAVING  BEEN THROUGH IT WITH CLINTON. WASN'T THE ONE WITH CLINTON  WHERE THEY PUT A DIFFERENT  SPEECH IN THE PROMPT?
ACTUALLY IT WASN'T THE STATE  OF THE UNION. A BIG HEALTH CARE SPEECH. THAT WAS SEPTEMBER 1993. HE WAS... IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE  A SPEECH ON HEALTH CARE. WHAT WAS IN THERE WAS STATE OF  THE UNION FROM SIX MONTHS  BEFORE. YES. SERIOUSLY. I WAS IN CHARGE.
Jon: YOU WERE IN CHARGE? IN THEORY, YEAH. Jon: BUT IN PRACTICE? AND AS I SAW THE SPEECH GOING  THROUGH AT HYPER SPEED AND  CLINTON BEING BRILLIANT AND JUST ADD LIBBING THE ENTIRE THING, I  SAW MY CAREER GOING BEFORE MY  EYES.
Jon: THEY NEVER GOT THE  ACTUAL SPEECH BACK UP?
13 MINUTES. 13 MINUTES WHILE LOOKING AT A  SCREEN THAT HAD ANOTHER SPEECH  GOING AT 90 MILES PER HOUR. IT WAS AMAZING
Jon: HOW MANY "REALLYS" DID  HE USE? DID HE SAY ANYTHING LIKE, "IT'S  REALLY, REALLY, REALLY  IMPORTANT."  IT'S VERY, VERY, VERY, BIG. HE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT? IS THIS JUST GOING TO BE ANOTHER  EXERCISE IN THEATER?
IT'S ALWAYS THEATER. THEATER IS IMPORTANT. THE THEATER DOES MATTER. THE BIG NEW THEATER YOU'RE GOING  TO SEE TOMORROW BUT I DO THINK  IN THIS CASE THE SYMBOLISM THAT COULD BE MOVING IS A LOT OF  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TOMORROW ARE  ACTUALLY BRINGING VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE AS THEIR GUESTS.
Jon: REALLY? FROM NEWTOWN  Jon: I KNEW THAT THE  PRESIDENT WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE  LIKE SORT OF A LITTLE SECTION WHERE HE HAD... PEOPLE WITH THE  FIRST LADY
CONGRESS CAN BRING SOME AS  WELL. SEVERAL OF THEM ARE DOING IT. THE LAST COUNT I SAW WAS ABOUT  TWO DOZEN. IT'S PROBABLY GONE UP.
Jon: REALLY. THE ONLY THING I SAW -- THIS MAY  OR MAY NOT BE TRUE -- BUT THAT  ONE CONGRESS PERSON IS ACTUALLY BRINGING TED NUGENT. I SWEAR TO GOD. LIKE MAYBE IT'S IN A RESPONSE TO  THE SECOND AMENDMENT THING. MAYBE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GO  OUT AFTERWARDS. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE  PLANNING. THEN THERE'S THIS TRADITION NOW. THERE'S ALWAYS THE REPUBLICAN  REBUTTAL BUT NOW THERE'S ALSO  THE AT A PARTY REBUTTALS. TWO AT A PARTY REBUTTALS
IN INSTEAD OF A REPUBLICAN  RESPONSE. YOU HAVE THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE  MARCO RUBIO THE SENATOR FROM  FLORIDA IS GOING TO GIVE IT AND RAND PAUL GOING TO GIVE THE TEA  PARTY RESPONSE
Reporter: BUT MARCO RUBIO IS  A TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN
HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE TEA  PARTY THE LAST TIME AROUND AS HE  GOT ELECTED. SEVERAL OF THEM ARE NOT HAPPY  WITH HIS POSITION ON  IMMIGRATION. RAND PAUL IS STRIKING OUT. LIKE HIS FATHER, I THINK ONE DAY  HE WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. HE'S GOING TO DELIVER THE  MESSAGE OF THE TEA PARTY
Jon: AT A CERTAIN POINT,  COULD THERE BE THAT AND THE TEA  PARTY AND ONE THAT IS AN INTERPRETIVE DANCE AFTERWARDS? THE PRESIDENT NOW, YOU KNOW,  THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT GOING ON  ABOUT THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY AND HE'S A TYRANT. I THINK HE MADE A SMART MOVE BY  SAYING WE SHOULD PROBABLY SET  JUDICIAL LIMITS FOR HOW WE USE DRONES
WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT  HE'S DOING. YOU SHOULD HAVE TO ANSWER TO  SOMEONE.
Jon: YOU WOULD THINK YOU  WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER TO SOMEONE. DO YOU THINK THE IDEA IS THAT HE  DIDN'T FOR A FEW YEARS AND THEN  THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS A RECOURSE AND THAT EACH CASE WAS  VIEWED BUT ONLY BY SOMEONE... NO  JUDICIAL REVIEW AT ALL
THERE'S NO FORMAL PROCESS  WHERE A COURT HAS TO REVIEW IT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE  TALKING ABOUT. IN SOME WAYS IT'S NOT PRACTICAL. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW EVERYONE  FELT AFTER 9/11
Jon: BUT, I MEAN, IF WE GO  PURELY ON EMOTION, YOU KNOW, YOU  CAN MAKE THE CASE, WELL, LET'S HAVE VIGILANTE JUSTICE
IT'S NOT SIMPLY EMOTION. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE AL  QAEDA MEMBERS WHO ARE TRYING TO  CARRY OFF OPERATIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY. PROBABLY NOT IN THE UNITED  STATES BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
Jon: LIKE THE WARRANTLESS  WIRE TAP THERE HAS TO BE A COURT  DUE PROCESS SET UP SO THE AMERICANS FEEL... YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT AMERICANS. LET'S SAY THEY JOIN AL QAEDA BUT  THERE HAS TO BE SOME PROCESS  THAT IS JUDICIALLY SAFE
THERE HAS TO BE DUE PROCESS. WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH  AMERICANS THERE'S BEEN A  TRADITION THOUGH IF SOMEONE  JOINS THE ENEMY, THEY BECOME AN  ENEMY. IF DRONES WILL BE USED MORE AND  MORE AND MORE.
Jon: I'VE GOT ONE. I'VE GOT A NEIGHBOR THAT I'M  PRETTY SURE HAS JOINED AL QAEDA. THAT'S MY POINT. YOU CANNOT... YOU HAVE TO HAVE  SOME... YOU HAVE TO GET... THERE'S NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT.
BUT HOW CAN YOU DO IT IN A  WAY THAT IS PRACTICAL? THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.
Jon: EVEN WHEN THE PRESIDENT  WAS ON HERE, HE SAID I THINK  CONGRESS HAS TO REIGN ME IN, WHICH IS LITERALLY LIKE I HAVE A  PROBLEM. I MEAN, SOMEONE SHOULD TAKE MY  KEYS. I'M STARTING TO LIKE THIS.
HE SAID THAT. Jon: HE SAID IT'S TEMPTING  AND CONGRESS SHOULD REIN ME IN. OF COURSE CONGRESS IS THE MOST  DYSFUNCTIONAL BODY SINCE THE  JACKSON 5. I MEAN, THEY ARE THE WORST. THANKS FOR COMING BY. ENJOY, GET SOME SLEEP. WE'LL SEE YOU. PLEASE SEND ROBIN ROBERTS MY  BEST. I'M SO GLAD SHE'S FEELING WELL  AND COMING BACK. GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
