FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST COLIN FIRTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST LET'S TURN TO UKRAINE. [LAUGHTER] REALLY, THE AMERICAN AUDIENCE IMMEDIATELY LIKE DID WE BOMB THEM? WHAT HAPPENED? [LAUGHTER] AFTER JUST A FEW WEEKS FROM WHEN CRIMEA OFFICIALLY JOINED RUSSIA ANOTHER REGION OF UKRAINE HAS SAID I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING. THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE IS DEEPENING THIS MORNING WITH THE THREAT OF MORE LOST TERRITORY. PRO RUSSIA ACTIVISTS ARE TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL OF  GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN TWO EASTERN CITIES.
THIS TINY SPACE IS THE SELF-DECLARED PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF DONETSK WHERE JUST DAYS AGO IT WAS JUST THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.
Jon: NOW IT'S A DELI! [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT, WAIT SO IN UKRAINE THEY ARE DECLARING INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS INDEPENDENT NATIONS NOW? SORRY THIS IS THE REPUBLIC OF DONETSK YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GAS STATION-STAN. IT'S DOWN THE STREET YOU MAKE AT A LEFT AT THE USS-ARBYS. LOOK, LISTEN TO ME. I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG THE UKRAINIAN ARMY IS BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET BOGGED DOWN WITH A SIEGE OF THAT BUILDING-GRAD.
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY IS WARNING UKRAINE'S GOVERNMENT AGAINST HARMING ETHNIC RUSSIANS INSIDE UKRAINE'S OWN BORDERS.
Jon: ETHNIC RUSSIANS? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THESE ARE THE PROUD DENIZENS OF DONETSK. A FIERCELY INDEPENDENT NATION LOCATED AT 315 PUSHKIN BOULEVARD. ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THE ENTRANCE ON KLITSCHKO AVENUE IT'S EASIER. LOOK. THIS IS NOT LOOK GOING FOR UKRAINE. IT APPEARS RUSSIA MAY BE TROLLING THESE GUYS FOR ANY EXCUSE TO FURTHER INVADE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. UKRAINIANS MUST STAND STRONG AND UNIFIED TO REPEL THIS THREAT.
A FIGHT BREAKING OUT IN UKRAINE'S PARLIAMENT. THIS CAME AFTER A LAWMAKER DEFENDED THE PRO-RUSSIA ACTIVISTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I SEE THEY FOLLOW ROBERT'S RULES OF DISORDER. PROBLEM SOLVED. WHAT BETTER WAY TO CONVINCE RUSSIA YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PERSECUTE ETHNIC RUSSIANS IN YOUR COUNTRY THAN TO BEAT THE (bleep) OUT OF THEM WHEN THEY TRY TO TALK. IT APPEARS ONCE AGAIN THERE'S TROUBLING IN THE WORLD AS THE SPECTRE OF OLD SCHOOL IMPERIALISM RAISES ITS UGLY HEAD THE WORLD ONCE AGAIN SENDS OUT A BEACON, A CRY FOR HELP, FROM THE WORLD'S SUPER HERO: AMERICA! OH, ALL RIGHT. PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT BEACON 30 YEARS AGO. WE'VE LET OURSELVES GO. MUCH MORE FLATTERING SIGNAL. GO ON.
THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE 21ST CENTURY TOOLS TO HOLD RUSSIA ACCOUNTABLE FOR 19th CENTURY BEHAVIOR.
Jon: THAT GOES FOR ANY 19th CENTURY RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR EVEN WRITING A COMPLEX NATURALISTIC NOVEL THAT SERVES AS AN ALLEGORY FOR THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN A PURE SOUL UNDER THE HARSH REPRESSION OF THE CZAR. I'M LOOKING AT YOU TOLSTOY. ANY-HOO.
WHAT ARE THE SOME OF THE 21ST CENTURY TOOLS.
Jon: I'M GOING WITH CANDY CRUSH, TWITTER, NICE. TINDER. WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO SWIPE LEFT ON RUSSIA.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THESE -- A U.S. WARSHIP IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A SHOW OF PRESENCE ENTERING THE BLACK SEA NO LATTER THAN THURSDAY.
Jon: NOTHING SAYS WE'RE GOING TO USE 21ST CENTURY TOOLS LIKE BOATS. [ LAUGHTER ] VLADMIR PUTIN SEEMS POISED TO ABSORB UKRAINE'S ENTIRE RUSSIAN POPULATION. BUT WHO'S IS TO SAY HE'LL STOP THERE. OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE INVESTIGATES RUSSIA'S NEXT POSSIBLE STOP.
VLADMIR PUTIN ANNEXTATION OF CRIMEA SHOCKED THE WORLD AND FOREIGN POLICY NERDS LIKE ANDREW WEISS ARE CONCERNED THAT RUSSIA WILL CONTINUE TO ILLEGALLY EXPAND ITS BORDERS.
WE'VE BASICALLY SEEN ONLY THE BEGINNING OF RUSSIA'S MUSCLE MOVEMENTS HERE. RUSSIA HAS A LOT OF ARROWS IN THE QUIVER. IT'S QUITE SCARY.
WHO IS IT MOST SCARY FOR?
THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE SCARED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. KAZAKHSTAN AND THE CAUCUSES. THEY HAVE LARGE ETHNIC RUSSIAN POPULATIONS..
OK I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY ARE KIND OF LIKE THE SAME TO ME. WHAT ABOUT OUR COUNTRY? SHOULD WE BE AFRAID?
I THINK THE MOST TROUBLING PART IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PUTIN WANTS. HE SAYS "I'M DEFENDING ETHNIC RUSSIANS." THEY COULD BE ANY ANYWHERE.
WHAT I'M HEARING IS IT COULD HAPPEN HERE.
NO WAY.
OK, YOU DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE? GIVE ME SOME ODDS.
I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASTROID HITTING THE EARTH ODDS. SO ONE IN A COUPLE TRILLION.
SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS, IT COULD HAPPEN HERE.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
OK, YOU ALREADY GAVE ME THE ODDS. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT BACK. TOO LATE, GO TO THE PACKAGE.
IT COULD HAPPEN HERE.
SO I HEADED TO WHERE PUTIN IS MOST LIKELY TO INVADE NEXT, A FAR AWAY PLACE WHERE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND TRADITIONS DOMINATE THE LOCAL CULTURE. A TERRIFIED NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED BRIGHTON BEACH BROOKLYN, AMERICA. SKEPTICAL? WELL, THEN LET'S EXAMINE THE PARALLELS BETWEEN CRIMEA AND BRIGHTON BEACH. WHY WAS CRIMEA RIPE FOR THE PICKING?
THE MAIN ISSUES WAS THE PEOPLE OF CRIMEA DON'T LIKE LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THE REST UKRAINE. A LOT OF THEM BASICALLY SEE THEMSELVES AS EX-SOVIET OR RUSSIANS CULTURALLY.
OKAY. SO LET'S SEE IF THE PEOPLE OF BRIGHTON BEACH ARE TRULY RUSSIAN. CREEPY SOVIET VIBE, CHECK. RUSSIAN STYLE LEISURE.  IS THIS YOUR VERSION OF SUNBATHING? CHECK.  TRADITIONAL RUSSIAN ATTIRE? OF COURSE. STRONG SENSE OF RUSSIANNESS?
SHOW OF HANDS, WHO HERE CONSIDERS THEMSELVES TO BE ETHNICALLY RUSSIAN. OH, MY OKAY. DRIPPING WET BALLS. I'M AFRAID SO. BUT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE THAT UNIQUELY RUSSIAN JE NE SAIS QUOI? GIVE ME YOUR BEST AND MOST BEAUTIFUL RUSSIAN SMILE. [ LAUGHTER ] SHOW ME YOUR BIGGEST, BRIGHTEST RUSSIAN SMILE. LIFT THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH. JUST LIFT THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH INTO A SMILE. [ LAUGHTER ] I DARE YOU TO (bleep) LOOK AT THIS VIDEO AND NOT SMILE. UGH WHAT KIND OF MONSTER ARE YOU? NOTHING COULD MAKE THESE PEOPLE SMILE. SHOW ME THE SMILE ON YOUR FACE WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND OUT THAT PUTIN ILLEGALLY ANNEXED CRIMEA. OH, THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. I KNEW IT.
EXCEPT FOR THAT. WE'RE SO GETTING INVADED.
OK I WAS JUST IN BRIGHTON BEACH. AND IT CAN HAPPEN HERE IT COULD HAPPEN HERE. NO CUT THAT (bleep) OUT. SERIOUSLY IT COULD HAPPEN HERE.
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE. PUTIN KEEPS SAYING THAT PEOPLE IN UKRAINE ARE UNDER THE THREAT OF NEO-NAZI MOBS HUNTING DOWN ETHIC RUSSIANS. AND THAT CREATED A PREDICATE FOR MILITARY ACTION IN CRIMEA.
CRIMEA HAS MARAUDING GROUPS OF GUYS SCARING LOCAL RUSSIANS BUT THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING LIKE THAT IN BRIGHTON BEACH.
ALL WINTER, ALL WINTER THEY SITTING HERE.
WHO?
THE GUYS.
THEY COME AND PEOPLE THEY DRINK VODKA HERE. THIS IS NO GOOD.
VODKA, VODKA AND THEN GOING PEE PEE.
THEY DOING THE VODKA. THEY'RE GOING PEE PEE EVERYWHERE.
THEY FIGHT. YEAH.  PEE PEE IN THE ROAD.
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
(bleep) IT IS HAPPENING HERE.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING HERE. PUTIN IS NOT MOVING INTO BROOKLYN.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY. AND THEN THEY COME FOR YOU IN THEIR GODDAMN NEON SPEEDOS. LEAVING ME ONLY ONE CHOICE:  CONDITION MY BODY, LEARN THEIR CUSTOMS. YOUR BEARD HAIR IS TICKLING ME A LITTLE BIT. [LAUGHTER] AND DO MY BEST TO BLEND IN HOPING THAT WHEN MY NEW OVERLORDS ARRIVE I'LL BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SAM BEE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
