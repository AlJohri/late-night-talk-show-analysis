FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M JON STEWART. OH, WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. GENERAL BILLY Mc-- STANLEY  McCHRYSTAL. LAST NIGHT WE TALKED FISCAL  CLIFF. IN THE WAKE OF THINGS THAT  HAPPENED. NEWTOWN A ROARA, PORTLAND,  TUCSON -- IT'S A 22 MINUTE SHOW  SO I'M NOT GOING TO LIST EVERYBODY BUT FINALLY EVERYBODY  IS READY TO TALK ABOUT GUN  VIOLENCE. THE PATROL HAS BEEN READY FOR  QUITE SOME TIME NOW. LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION  PEOPLE. NOTHING IS OFF THE TABLE. NO BAD IDEA. IT'S A SAFE SPACE. LET'S START THE DISCUSSION ON  GUN VIOLENCE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GUN  CONTROL.
GUN CONTROL IS NOT GOING TO  MAKE ANY KID SAFER. WE HAVE TO GET THE REAL PROBLEM,  THE REAL CAUSES.
Jon: SORRY, I JUST ASSUMED  THAT BEGINNING A CONVERSATION  ABOUT GUN CONTROL MEANT STARTING WITH GUNS BUT YOU WANT TO TALK  ABOUT THE NON-GUN CAUSE OF -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- GUN VIOLENCE. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S A CONVERSATION NO BAD IDEAS  MAYBE THERE'S OTHER FACTORS WE  SHOULD LOOK AT. LET'S -- WHAT OTHER NONE-GUN  CAUSES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT  HERE. WE HAVE VIOLENCE SURROUNDING US  WE THINK IS OKAY.
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES WITH  NAMES LIKE BULLET STORM, GRAND  THEFT AUTO CANO, FILM LIKE AMERICAN PSYCHO, NATURAL BORN  KILLERS.
Jon: NATURAL BORN KILLER  AND AMERICAN PSYCHO. HOLY -- HAS IT BEEN THAT LONG  SINCE WE'VE HAD A CONVERSATION  WITH GUN CONTROL. BEEN THAT LONG THAT WE'VE  DEFLECTED THE GUN CONTROL  ARGUMENT WITH THE CORRUPT  HOLLYWOOD MEDIA ARGUMENT? THAT FRENCH GUYS HAD A POINT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT MAY BE AN INDIRECT INFLUENCE  BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION WE  GLORIFY VIOLENCE IN OUR CULTURE. IF A MASSACRE OCCURS IN A  SCHOOLHOUSE AND TV NETWORK HEADS  HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO SEE IF IT'S GOING TO BUMP UP AGAINST THE  PRIMETIME EPID SIC SCHEDULE  THAT'S A (bleep) PROBLEM. IS THIS TERRIBLE MASSACRE GOING  TO EFFECT OUR NEW SHOW  "MASSACRE" FRIDAYS AT 8:00. THE HOT LEAD TO CORPS RAPER SVU  STARRING -- AS FOR VIOLENT VIDEO  GAMES I GUESS THEY ARE OUT  THERE. THE DUTCH SPEND MORE ON VIDEO  GAMES THAN WE DO AND HAVE LESS  VIOLENCE. TO BE FAIR THEIR VIDEO GAMES ARE  THE FIRST PERSON DIKE PLUGGING  DRAWMA. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE  CULTURE AND SEE IF IT'S ADDING  TO THE SOUP. BUT LET'S LOOK AT ALL OF OUR  CULTURE, HOLLYWOOD'S INFLUENCE  ON THAT BUT ARE THERE OTHER MEDIA INFLUENCES THAT SHOULD BE  EXAMINED.
ARE INTEREST TERROR CELLS IN  YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?
THE NEW BLACK PANTHER PARTY  OUTSIDE A POLLING PLACE.
THE SHARIA MOSQUES.
FOUR YEARS INTO TYRANNY  WINNING.
IF YOU LIVE IN THE EAST, MAY  I RECOMMEND GET THE HELP OUT OF  EAST.
IT'S ARMAGEDDON.
YOUR RELIGION WILL COME UNDER  AL TACKth IF OBAMA IS  REELECTED, THIS COUNTRY IS OVER! [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M NOT SURE WHAT  HAPPENED. I THOUGHT -- I -- I BLACKED OUT  IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT AND WOKE  UP WITH AN AK -- WHATEVER THIS  IS. I'M SURE I'LL GET LETTERS ABOUT  WHAT THIS REALLY IS. WHICH IS PLASTIC IS WHAT IT  REALLY IS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT BRINGS US BACK TO THE MORE  DIRECT ISSUE OF GUNS.
GUN CONTROL DOESN'T WORK.
Jon: OR NOT. [ LAUGHTER ] I KEEP FORGETTING WHAT ELSE?
WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH  SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY  COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY  COLLAPSED.
Jon: OKAY, OKAY. AGAIN, 100%. THANK YOU, WAYNE LAPEEER FAR  BRINGING THIS UP. THE MENTALLY ILL LIVE ON THE  STREETS AND ARE IN PRISON. IT'S UP TO US TO HELP THEM FIND  PROACTIVE CARE. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS.
WE HAVE NO NATIONAL DATABASE  OF THESE LUNATICS.
Jon: OR THAT. OR THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I WAS GOING TO SAY COMPASSIONATE  TOTAL CARE OF MENTAL ILLNESS OR  LUNATIC DATABASE. ALTHOUGH ISN'T THAT WHAT THE  INTERNET IS? ISN'T THAT A NATIONAL DATABASE. WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITERIA FOR  THE LUNATIC DATABASE? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO GET ON IT?
AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO BE  ADDED TO THAT PILE OF DEAD  PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT DEFENSELESS BY THE U.N. POLICIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LAPIERRE WITH TWO RS  OR ONE? I DON'T WANT TO CULL A  CONVERSATION BRITT STARTS. MENTAL HEALTH CARES THAT BE ON  TABLE BUT THAT LEADS TO OTHER  PROBLEMS, CRIMES, GUN, VIOLENCE.
WE DON'T HAVE A CRIME  PROBLEM, OR A GUN PROBLEM, OR   EVEN A VIOLENCE PROBLEM. WHAT WE HAVE A SIN PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IS THIS ABOUT ME  MASTURBATING? IS IN A -- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS  ABOUT? LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT  WAS CONSIDERED A NATIONAL ISSUE. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOK, WE CAN DANCE AROUND THE  ISSUE ALL WE WANT. WE CAN BLAME MOVIES OR THE VIDEO  GAMES OR THE MENTALLY ILL OR GOD  AND WE HAVE TO PUT IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM AND ALL  SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BONE THE TABLE  BUT IT'S TIME WE TALK ABOUT  GUNS.
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS. I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS GUN  CONTROL DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A DAY, A PLACE AND A  TIME FOR ALL THAT.
Jon: IT'S TODAY, RIGHT NOW. IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE TIME TO TALK  ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND NOTHING  IS -- SORRY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE NEED TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. GUESS WE'LL TALK ABOUT GUNS WHEN  WE COME BA
