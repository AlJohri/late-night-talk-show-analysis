(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO LAST NIGHT NO QUESTION, BIG NIGHT FOR MITT ROMNEY, BUT EVEN IN VICTORY REPUBLICANS ARE  FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO CELEBRATE, OR EVEN NOT TO MOURN.
WE'VE GOT THE FIELD, WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE STAGES OF DEATH HERE. (LAUGHTER) WE'RE GOING THROUGH ANGER, DENIAL, BARGAINING. I THINK WE'RE NOW AT THE DEPRESSION. THE NEXT STEP IS ACCEPTANCE.
Jon: AND THEN, OF COURSE, OUR OWN INEVITABLE DECLINE AND DEATH. WOW, THAT GUY'S A DOWNER. NOTHING 15 MINUTES IN THE CUBE CAN'T FIX. (LAUGHTER) STILL, THAT'S CNN, EVERYONE THERE IS DEPRESSED AND FOR GOOD REASON. (LAUGHTER) BUT... MY GUESS IS THEY REALLY DON'T CARE FOR US OVER E THERE. BUT IF YOU WANT THE UNVARNISHED TAKE ON ROMNEY'S VICTORY, YOU'VE  GOT TO GO TO THE NO-SPIN ZONE.
I DON'T THINK ROMNEY WINS IN MICHIGAN EVEN IF HE WINS IN  MICHIGAN BECAUSE EVERYBODY SAYS "OOH, HE JUST WON BY A LITTLE. OOH, OOH, OOH." AND THEN IF HE LOSES EVERYBODY GOES WHOA!
Jon: OOH OOH OOH, WHOA! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, A BROADCASTING FIRST, FEBRUARY 21 AT 8:15 P.M. EAST COAST TIME, BILL O'REILLY RAN OUT OF WORDS. (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE RETURN TO SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST JOHN OLIVER IN MICHIGAN. SO, JOHN, THE ANALYSTS SAY THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING ROMNEY COULD HAVE DONE LAST NIGHT THAT COULD  HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A FULL VICTORY. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
MEH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT WAS UNEQUIVOCALLY A GOOD NIGHT FOR ROMNEY?
HEHH.
Jon: SO YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO GUTTURAL ROUTE?
OOH, OOH.
Jon: THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE FOR ME?
WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER? AN ELABORATE ANALOGY OF WHAT THE VICTORY MEANS? A SERIES OF FORCED METAPHORS, A POLITICAL HAIKU? THIS PRIMARY HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID!
THE WAY I LOOK AT POLITICS IS THE WAY HEMINGWAY LOOKED AT MORALITY. WHAT'S GOOD IS WHAT YOU FEEL GOOD AFTER.
IN ANY KIND OF SOCCER OR FOOTBALL MATCH OR BASEBALL YOU WIN... YOU WIN... A WIN IS A WIN.
MADE IT A SYMBOLIC TSUNAMI.
LIKE PUTTING A McCOAT ON A MINK.
THEY WERE PLAYING THE MUSIC FROM "THE NATURAL" IN THIS FILM, THE OLD ROBERT REDFORD MOVIE.
IT REMIND ME OF THE... "LAST OF THE MOHICANS."
THE DEATH STAR IMAGERY IS VERY APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT IS TAKING OUT THAT MOON AND THEN  THAT PLANET TO CLEAR A PATHWAY TO THE NOMINATION. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WOW! AND THAT'S JUST FROM ONE NIGHT? THAT'S CRAZY.
I KNOW!
Jon: BECAUSE THE DEATH STAR WASN'T TRY TO CLEAR A PATHWAY TO ANYTHING. THE DEATH STAR BLEW UP THE PEACEFUL PLANET OF ALDERAAN TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EMPIRE WAS...
... THE ULTIMATE POWER IN THE UNIVERSE!
Jon: EXACTLY! A RIDICULOUS METAPHOR.
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THE DEATH STAR WAS A MONEY PIT.
Jon: THERE'S NO WAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUSTAINABLE. AND VULNERABLE? WHERE WAS THE SECURITY? THE WEAK POINT WAS ONLY THE SIZE OF A WOMP RAT ON TATTOOINE BUT TWO METERS IS TWO METERS, RIGHT?
I KNOW! BUT THE POINT IS, JON, WITH ALL THE HOURS OF TALK, NOTHING I HEARD LAST NIGHT MADE ANY MORE  SENSE THAN WHEN O'REILLY SAID-- AND I'M QUOTING HERE-- EWW. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN GIVE AN ACCURATE, INFORMED ANALYSIS GUTTURALLY THROUGH SOUND?
EASY, EASY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.
EH.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT STPHRO +*ERPL.
EWW. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SOUTHERN STATES ARE IN PLAY ON SUPERTUESDAY. CAN'T RULE OUT GINGRICH.
AY YAI!
Jon: WHAT ABOUT RON PAUL.
UH-UH. UH-UH.
Jon: HE'S POLLING BETTER THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE AGAINST PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
UH-HUH. THERE WE GO.
Jon: OF COURSE, MAINSTREAM ESTABLISHMENT DOESN'T SEEM TO...
EW.
Jon: SO WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT RON PAUL.
NAH. SEE, JON, THIS DOES WORK, DOESN'T IT? OH, OH, HUH?
Jon: OH!
AH!
Jon: A HA!
MEOW, MEOW. (LAUGHTER) (HONKING)
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
