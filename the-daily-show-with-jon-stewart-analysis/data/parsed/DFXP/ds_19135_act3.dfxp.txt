[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THE PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR OF "ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY, THE STORY OF A BOY'S DANGEROUS ODYSSEY TO REUNITE WITH HIS MOTHER." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM SONIA NAZARIO. HELLO. NICE SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY WE'D LOVE TO SAY THAT THIS SITUATION HAS GOTTEN BETTER SINCE THE TIME OF THIS VERY ACCLAIMED "ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY." WHEN, WHEN DID YOU, DID YOU WRITE THIS, ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO?
YEAH, I WENT TO HONDURAS 13 AND TEN YEARS AGO...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WAS WRITING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THESE WOMEN WHO COME HERE, SINGLE MOTHERS, LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN BEHIND IN CENTRAL AMERICA, MEXICO, AND THE CHILDREN WHO FOLLOW THEM AND MAKE THIS MODERN-DAY ODYSSEY ON TOP OF FREIGHT TRAINS TO COME SEARCHING FOR THEIR MOTHERS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I WROTE ABOUT IT THROUGH THE STORY OF ONE BOY WHO DOES THIS. HE DOESN'T SEE HIS MOM FOR 11 YEARS. SHE LEAVE HIM WHEN HE'S FIVE YEARS OLD.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND AFTER 11 YEARS HE'S DESPERATE TO BE WITH HER, AND HE MAKES THIS INCREDIBLE JOURNEY ON TOP OF FREIGHT TRAINS.
Jon: DANGER AND FILLED WITH BEATINGS AND VIOLENCE AND ALL KINDS OF TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN TO THESE KIDS AS THEY'RE MAKING THIS JOURNEY.
YEAH, INCREDIBLE DANGER. I, I DID THE JOURNEY FOR THREE MONTHS ON TOP OF FREIGHT TRAINS TO WRITE ABOUT WHAT THIS IS LIKE. AND THEY FACE BANDITS ALONGSIDE THE RAILS, GANGS THAT I WOULD SEE CONTROLLING THE TRAIN TOPS, ROAMING FROM CAR TO CAR...
Jon: RIGHT.
RAPING, KILLING THESE CHILDREN.
Jon: TERRIBLE.
I RODE WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY. THERE WERE 7-YEAR-OLD BOYS MAKING THIS JOURNEY ALONE ACROSS FOUR COUNTRIES COMING IN SEARCH OF THEIR PARENTS.
Jon: AND THIS, FOR THE MOST PART BACK THEN, THE ISSUE WAS POVERTY.
POVERTY AND REUNITING WITH THE PARENT.
Jon: AND REUNITING WITH THE PARENT...
YES.
Jon: BUT THE PARENT HAD GONE FOR POVERTY. HOW HAS THE CONDITION CHANGED IN HONDURAS NOW?
WELL, SO I WENT BACK TO HONDURAS...
Jon: YEAH.
TO THIS BOY'S NEIGHBORHOOD LAST MONTH...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I WAS JUST SHOCKED BY THE CHANGE THAT I SAW, ENORMOUS GROWTH IN VIOLENCE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE WERE GANGS BACK THEN, BUT NOW IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, THESE NARCO CARTELS, WE'VE, WE STOPPED THE FLOW OF COCAINE FROM COLOMBIA UP THE CARIBBEAN TO THE UNITED STATES. WE SPENT $8 BILLION TO DO THAT, BUT IT SIMPLY REROUTED INLAND TO HONDURAS. SO ALL THESE COCAINE FLIGHTS GOING TO THE U.S. LAND THERE, AND THESE NARCO CARTELS, MOSTLY MEXICAN, ARE REALLY FIGHTING FOR CONTROL OVER THIS TURF. AND THESE CHILDREN HAVE BECOME THEIR FOOT SOLDIERS. >>Jon: RIGHT.
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO RECRUIT THESE CHILDREN AT A VERY YOUNG AGE TO USE DRUGS, DISTRIBUTE DRUGS, SERVE AS LOOKOUTS AND ULTIMATELY SERVE AS HITMEN FOR THESE CARTELS. SO THEY HAD A GRIP ON HIS NEIGHBORHOOD NOW, AND CHILDREN LIVING IN JUST ENORMOUS FEAR, HAD BEEN THREATENED MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE TIME THEY WERE 11 YEARS OLD.
Jon: AND NOW THESE KIDS, SO, SO THIS IS THE SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW WITH 40,000 KIDS, 45,000 KIDS THAT HAVE COME UP FROM CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH THESE TURF WARS, THESE DRUG TURF WARS.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THEY GET TO OUR BORDER, AND WE DO WHAT?
WELL, I THINK WE NEED TO SEE THESE CHILDREN FOR WHAT THEY ARE. THEY ARE REFUGEES. THEY ARE FLEEING... AN IMMIGRANT WHO COMES HERE FOR ECONOMIC REASONS, FOR A BETTER LIFE...
Jon: RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE TO DEPORT THAT PERSON. I'M NOT AN OPEN-BORDERS GAL, BUT THESE CHILDREN, AND I TALKED TO AN 11-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO SAID, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE BEATING ME IN MY SCHOOL TRYING TO FORCE ME TO USE DRUGS. I KNOW THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED THIS YEAR. MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THESE 12-YEAR-OLD NARCOS SHOW UP AND THEY SAY, ALL OF THESE KIDS HAVE TO GO WITH ME, THESE TEN-YEAR-OLDS, TO DISTRIBUTE CRACK IN MY SCHOOL.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THESE CHILDREN ARE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES, AND I THINK IT'S REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT FOR US TO STAND UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THESE CHILDREN.
Jon: AND WHY IS IT SO HARD TO DO THAT? YOU KNOW, IT'S... [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, YOU SEE THESE IMMIGRANTS, I, I, THIS IS, YOU KNOW, MAY BE A BIT OF A RIGHT TURN, BUT I SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN JORDAN LAST SUMMER. THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH IT MUST HAVE BEEN SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN IT.
RIGHT.
Jon: THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES, WATER, OIL, THEY DON'T HAVE IN THAT COUNTRY. REFUGEES ARE POURING IN BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FROM SYRIA, FROM IRAQ, AND THEY DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE REFUGE AND ASYLUM.
AND WE TELL THEM TO.
Jon: AND WHY, AND WE LINE UP AT THE BORDER AND YELL AT THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: SO IT'S,  I THINK IT'S EMBARRASSING FOR OUR COUNTRY.
IT IS EMBARRASSING. I MEAN, I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE USED THESE SIX YEAR OLDS AS PUNCHING BAGS AHEAD OF THE PRIMARY PLAYING TO THEIR BASE, SAYING THAT THESE KIDS ARE CRIMINALS AND THEY'RE CARRYING EBOLA. AND THEY'RE SIMPLY PLAYING TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR, THESE ANTI-IMMIGRANT FEELINGS, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, INSTEAD OF SAYING, LET'S GIVE THESE KIDS A REAL DUE PROCESS, LET'S LET THEM GO TO COURT AND SEE IF THEY'RE REFUGEES.
Jon: RIGHT. WHICH IS THE LAW, BY THE WAY, THE 2008 LAW THAT...
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED WAS THAT IF YOU COME FROM CENTRAL AMERICA AND YOU'RE SEEKING ASYLUM, YOU ARE, YOU ARE OWED DUE PROCESS.
AND SHAME ON HIM FOR TRYING TO CHANGE THAT LAW. BECAUSE HE'S TRYING EXPEDITE THEIR REMOVAL.
Jon: PRESIDENT OBAMA?
PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TO CHANGE THAT LAW SO THESE KIDS ARE NOT GIVEN THEIR FAIR DAY IN COURT WHERE THEY CAN ARGUE WHETHER THEY'RE REFUGEES OR NOT.
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY NEED TO BE GIVEN A FULL, FAIR HEARING WITH AN ATTORNEY BY THEIR SIDE. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN IN THESE COURTROOMS, YOU KNOW, WE ALLOW MURDERERS IN THIS COUNTRY, WE PROVIDE THEM WITH A PUBLIC DEFENDER.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT AN IMMIGRANT CHILD IS NOT PROVIDED WITH THAT. AND SO MANY OF THEM CAN'T AFFORD AN ATTORNEY.
Jon: WHAT DOES A SIX YEAR OLD WHO ONLY SPEAKS SPANISH NEED WITH AN ATTORNEY? I'M SURE OUR COURT SYSTEM WILL SORT IT ALL OUT.
YEAH. I'M SURE THEY CAN, THEY CAN PRESENT A COMPLEX IMMIGRATION CASE ALL BY THEMSELVES. RIGHT? NO PROBLEM.
Jon: IS THERE, IS THERE A HUMANITARIAN MOMENTUM BUILDING TO BEGIN TO STATES SAYING, LOOK, WE'LL STEP IN, WE WILL HOUSE THEM OR AT LEAST GIVE THEM REASONABLE LIVING CONDITIONS UNTIL THIS CAN BE SORTED OUT?
YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE SEEN THE GRASSROOTS, MANY ACTUALLY CHRISTIAN, EVANGELICAL, BAPTIST GROUPS...
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT HAVE REALLY STOOD UP AND SAID, WE CAN HELP THESE CHILDREN IN THESE DETENTION FACILITIES.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT I THINK ON A POLITICAL LEVEL, THESE CHILDREN ARE BEING USED AS FOOTBALLS AND MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING, HOW FAST CAN WE GET RID OF THEM. AND THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO PUSH MEXICO AND GUATEMALA TO STOP THESE CHILDREN, TO BASICALLY SEAL THEM INTO THESE COUNTRIES WHERE MANY OF THESE CHILDREN FACE DEATH.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH THESE CHILDREN.
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY HAVE BEEN THREATENED MULTIPLE TIMES. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO SEE THESE CHILDREN NOT AS AN IMMIGRATION ISSUE, BUT AS A REFUGEE ISSUE,
Jon: REFUGEE ISSUE, YEAH.
LIKE WE DID WITH CUBANS, LIKE WE HAVE WITH HAITIANS. THERE HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY WHERE WE HAVE STOOD UP AND SAID, WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH THESE KIDS.
Jon: RIGHT. THE RIGHT THING. THE RIGHT THING. WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN A WHILE, HAVE WE? "ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY" IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SONIA NAZARIO.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
