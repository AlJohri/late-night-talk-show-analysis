(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A UNITED STATES CONGRESSWOMAN REPRESENTING NEW  YORK'S 28th DISTRICT. PLEASE WELCOME VIA SATELLITE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. CONGRESSWOMAN LOUISE SLAUGHTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US, CONGRESSWOMAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ACTUALLY, I'VE GOTTEN NEW RESPECT FROM MY STAFF FOR BEING ON YOUR SHOW, THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. I HAVE NEW RESPECT FROM MY STAFF ST-R BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO A SATELLITE INTERVIEW  WITHOUT A DELAY.
I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'S WONDERFUL.
Jon: THAT'S VERY NICE. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE THE SPONSOR... ORIGINAL SPONSOR OF THE STOCK ACT.
WE WROTE THE BILL.
Jon: YOU WROTE THE BILL THAT WAS ATTEMPTING TO STOP CONGRESS PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE  TO PROFIT FROM INSIDE INFORMATION.
AND THEIR STAFF.
Jon: AND THEIR STAFFS. WHEN DID YOU INTRODUCE THIS?
IN 2006. A YOUNG REPORTER AT THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," BRODIE MULLINS, WAS DOING A WONDERFUL JOB ON IT AND THAT'S HOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. WE WERE NOT AWARE OF IT UNTIL SOMEONE IN TOM DELAY'S OFFICE, HIS CHIEF OF STAFF, HAD BEEN DOING DAY TRADING ON GOVERNMENT COMPUTERS ALL DAY LONG.
Jon: HE WAS DOING DAY TRADING.
UH-HUH.
Jon: HE WAS WORKING IN CONGRESS WHILE DOING DAY TRADING?
YES. YES. WE'VE HEARD... THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE STORIES, MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT. POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE WAS A PART OF OUR ORIGINAL BILL AND TO ME IT'S REALLY THE MOST  IMPORTANT PART. IT'S WORTH $402 MILLION A YEAR AND IT'S TOTALLY UNREGULATED SO  SENATOR GRASSLEY AND I HAD BEEN SORT OF IN CAHOOTS ALONG WITH SENATOR LAHEY TO TRY TO GET THE  BILL INTO CONVERSATION. WE THINK IT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS.
Jon: RIGHT.
NOW, THE HOUSE BILL WAS HIJACKED. WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT. WE HAD HAD A COMMITTEE MEETING ONCE WHICH CANTOR STOPPED AND SAID WE WOULD DO SOME MORE ABOUT  THIS LATER. AFTER THE SENATE PASSED THE BILL THERE WAS THIS GREAT TPHRURFULLY THE HOUSE TO DO SOMETHING. HE TOOK THE BILL AND MADE IT INTO A SUSPENSION, WHICH TAKES TWO-THIRDS VOTE BUT DOESN'T GIVE  YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND IT WHICH CUT US OUT AGAIN FROM DOING ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.
Jon: NOW, CONGRESSWOMAN, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP YOU. EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED SOUNDS INSANE TO ME.
IT IS. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
Jon: IT SOUNDS INSANE.
IT IS INSANE.
Jon: ENOUGH IDEA OF WE WOULD LIKE TO STOP CONGRESS PEOPLE FROM COMMITTING AN ACT  THAT IF YOU ARE NOT IN CONGRESS IS ILLEGAL TO COMMIT.
AND PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR IT.
Jon: AND PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR IT AND YET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO ME IS SO THEY DID A  SUSPENSION, WE WENT TO COMMITTEE, THAT I DID TWO-THIRDS. IT STRIKES ME AS HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD MORE SUPPORT FOR A BILL. NOW, IT TOOK ME 13 YEARS TO PASS NONDISCRIMINATION SO I'M PRETTY  ERSISTENT BUT I'D NEVER SEENP ANYTHING LIKE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. WE HAD SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR GOODNESS SAKE. WE HAD 288 COSPONSORS, 98 OF THEM WERE REPUBLICANS.
Jon: IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL.
WELL, SO TO SPEAK. I'M NOT SURE HOW SERIOUS THEY WERE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BUT IT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE FACE--  UNLESS YOU WORK IN CONGRESS AND THEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE FACE. AND YOU SAY I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A BILL SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T PUNCH PEOPLE IN THE  FACE AND THEY SAY "WELL, WHAT DOES PUNCHING REALLY MEAN?" (LAUGHTER)  "IF I HIT SOMEONE WITH AN OPEN HAND, IS THAT A PUNCH, I DON'T KNOW."  IT'S FRUSTRATING.
IT'S AN ALLISS IF WONDER LAND WORLD. IT'S THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. IT'S GOTTEN WORSE.
Jon: WHAT'S SO CRAZY IS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE CHARGED WITH WRITING LAWS WHO ARE NOW  SAYING WELL, GEEZ, LAWS, DO THEY REALLY MEAN ANYTHING?
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, RIGHT NOW WE ARE REALLY PUSHING FOR  THE SENATE TO HOLD A CONFERENCE. TWO BILLS IN TWO HOUSES ARE NOT THE SAME SO THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY HAS NOTHING TO SIGN SO  IF EVERYBODY WILL JUST GET TO THEIR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND TELL THEM HOLD A  CONFERENCE FOR GOODNESS SAKE SO WE CAN PUT POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE BACK IN THIS BILL. REMEMBER THAT $402 MILLION A YEAR, TOTALLY UNREGULATED.
Jon: FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY. IT'S ILLEGAL!
IT IS ILLEGAL.
Jon: IT SHOULDN'T BE LEGAL.
WELL LET ME TELL YOU. THE DIFFICULTY IS PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THEY'RE LOBBYISTS. THEY'RE NOT REGISTERED ANYWHERE. AND SO WE HAVE LOTS OF REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT THEY WOULD DO WAS SET UP MEETINGS WITH MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS, PARTICULARLY CHAIRS OF COMMITTEES, AND THEN CHARGE THEIR CLIENTS $10,000 TO COME TO  HAVE THIS GREAT CONVERSATION WITH A GREAT ONE.
Jon: SENATOR HARKEN HAS THAT ISSUE.
SENATOR HARKEN DIDN'T GO, HOWEVER. WHEN HE WAS TOLD THEY WERE CHARGING, HE DIDN'T GO.
Jon: THEY WERE CHARGING HEDGE FUND GUYS $10,000 TO MEET WITH CONGRESS PEOPLE, GET  INFORMATION ABOUT BILLS, THEN THEY WOULD GO BACK TO THE HEDGE FUND AND MAKE STOCK DEALS.
INDEED. AND IT AFFECTED THE MARKET. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CASES OF THAT IS ASBESTOS AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ASBESTOS? THE STOCK WENT UP OVERNIGHT WHEN PEOPLE LEARNED THAT THE SENATE BILL WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR  REPARATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ARMED BY ASBESTOS.
Jon: AND SO THEY MADE A TON OF MONEY ON THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE  WITH MESOTHELIOMA WOULD NOT GET COMPENSATED.
AND THE THING IS WE KNOW BETTER. I TELL YOU, I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES KNOW BETTER THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I DON'T KNOW HOW WIDESPREAD IT IS BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY HAVE  ACCESS TO ALL THEIR FINANCIAL RECORDS. BUT THE IDEA THAT IT HAPPENED AND WE KNOW IT HAPPENED AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES IT HAPPENED  AND TO THIS DAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF DOING IT HAVE NEVER SAID NO I DIDN'T EXCEPT  MAYBE JUST THE MOST RECENT CASES WITH CONGRESSMAN BACHUS.
Jon: WELL, I CONGRATULATE YOU ON TRYING YOUR BEST TO GET THAT DONE.
WE'LL DO IT.
Jon: I'M GLAD IT'S A BIPARTISAN EFFORT AND I WOULD  JUST SAY TO PEOPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONTACT YOUR CONGRESS  PEOPLE WHILE YOU'RE ON THE LINE WITH THEM, WHILE YOU STILL CAN, I WOULD GET SOME STOCK TIPS. (LAUGHTER)
NO! NO!
Jon: SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN...
PLEASE, NO! (LAUGHS).
Jon: CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR J
