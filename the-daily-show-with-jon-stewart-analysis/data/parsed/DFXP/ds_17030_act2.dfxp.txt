Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. HONESTLY, WE'RE JUST RECOVERING FROM HERMAN CAIN DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN MY WRITERS' REACTION TO THAT NEWS OF HERMAN CAIN'S WITHDRAWAL.
NO!
NO! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS WAY!
OH GOD, OH MAN!
(BLEEP) (BLEEP) (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT WAS UPSETTING. THEY WEREN'T ALONE. WHEN CANE DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE I FELT DESPONDENT. I WAS DEPRESSED, I WAS LOSING ALL HOPE THAT MY JOB WOULD EVER BRING ME JOY AGAIN. AND... (LAUGHTER). AND THEN...
WE ARE JUST CONFIRMING THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL MODERATE A REPUBLICAN DEBATE ON DECEMBER 27  IN DES MOINES, IOWA.
Jon: (WHISPERING) THANK YOU, JESUS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WHEN GOD CLOSES A DOOR HE OPENS A WINDOW! AND SOMETIMES STANDING OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW A CIRCUS PEANUT WEARING A BADGER. (LAUGHTER) HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT! REGULAR REPUBLICANS, THE ONE WE USED TO HATE, ARE DOWN RIGHT SCARED.
Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE A GIANT GO TRIP AND ANYBODY WHO THINKS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS  GOING TO BE THE EQUIVALENT OF BRET BAIER OR ANY OF THE OTHER MODERATES IS KIDDING THEMSELVES.
SURE IT'S TIME DO SOMETHING PRESIDENTIAL AND STAND UP AND  SAY "WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE HIJACKED AND PARTICIPATE."
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO KISS HIS RING AND I'M NOT GOING TO  KISS ANY OTHER PART OF HIS ANATOMY. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: AREN'T WE A SAUCY MORMON. (LAUGHTER) DONALD?
A GUY LIKE KARL ROVE, HE'S THE ONE THAT GAVE US BUSH WHICH ULTIMATELY GAVE US OBAMA. HE'S A POLITICAL HACK. I'VE READ GEORGE BILL WILL OVER THE YEARS, HE'S THIRD RATE. HUNTSMAN WHO'S UPSET. I MEAN, HE'S GOT SUCH LOW POLLING NUMBERS, I WOULDN'T FEEL TOO GOOD IF I HAD 1%.
Jon: HEY, I WOULDN'T VOTE FOR THAT GUY WITH MITT ROMNEY'S (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) I LOVE THIS GUY! TRUMP CAN NEVER, EVER, EVER LET (BLEEP) SLIDE. HE CAN'T LET ANYTHING GO. THIS IS HIM YESTERDAY DOING A PHONE INTERVIEW WITH CHUCK TODD BUT FIRST HE WANTS TO GET ONE  THING STRAIGHT.
I DIDN'T CALL YOU, YOU CALLED ME ABOUT 40 TIMES.
I DID.
I DIDN'T CALL YOU SO YOUR STATEMENT IS FALSE. IS IT A CORRECT STATEMENT THAT I DO NOT CALL YOU, YOU CALLED ME?
WE CALLED YOU...
OKAY, YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT, THOUGH, CHUCK. I WISH YOU WOULD JUST BE STRAIGHT, CHUCK. BECAUSE HONESTLY I THINK YOU'D DO A LOT BETTER IF YOU WERE STRAIGHT.
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR DEBATE...
Jon: .
CHUCK, YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THAT IS THIS MAN IN A NUTSHELL. HE CAN'T LET GO OF THE QUESTION OF WHO CALLED WHO FIRST! (LAUGHTER) AND HE'S GOING TO MODERATE A DEBATE! YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS? NO, I WANT TO HEAR YOU WHAT YOU SAID WHEN YOU SAID I CUT YOU OFF. NO, WHO ARE YOU TO TELL AMERICA DONALD TRUMP, WHOSE DEBATE THIS IS HOW TO (BLEEP)ING MODERATE A DEBATE? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, I HANDLE MEATLOAF AND GARY BUSEY, YOU'RE NOTHING TO ME. (LAUGHTER) NOW, IF TRUMP HAD ONLY ANNOUNCED THAT HE WERE MODERATING A DEBATE  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE MY WEEK. BUT HE DID LET SLIP ONE OTHER BIT OF GOOD NEWS.
THE FACT IS THAT IF THE WRONG CANDIDATE IS NOMINATED TO RUN, I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK ABOUT  RUNNING AS AN INDEPENDENT, YES.
Jon: HOLY (BLEEP)! THIS GUY IS MODERATING A DEBATE DEBATE... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IF THE PEOPLE IN THE DEBATE HE'S MODERATING DON'T SATISFY HIM, (BLEEP) IT, HE'S JUMPING IN LAUGHTER)JUMPING IN.( I WONDER HOW MY WRITERS TOOK THAT NEWS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND
