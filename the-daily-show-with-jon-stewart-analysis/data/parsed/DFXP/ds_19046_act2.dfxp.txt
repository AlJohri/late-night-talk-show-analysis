[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, IN 2011 FOX NEWS PREMIERED A NOVEL NEW SHOW, THE FIVE. IT WAS A PANEL SHOW AT 5:00 WITH FIVE PUNDITS WHOSE OPINIONS RANGED FROM WALL STREET CONSERVATIVE TO 50-YEAR-OLD FRAT BOY CONSERVATIVE TO GEORGE W. BUSH CONSERVATIVE TO CONSERVATIVE TO FOX LIBERAL.
WHEN YOU WALK DOWN THE STREET YOU MUST FEEL LIKE A CHINAMAN WALKING IN AN NBA RALLY.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PERSONAL MASSEUSE, PREFERABLY KOREAN. AND NIGERIA, WHAT THEY MUST DO, THEY'RE THE GREATEST SCAM ARTISTS IN THE WORLD, THEY MUST TEACH THEM HOW TO RUN SCAMS AND PICKPOCKET PEOPLE. IRANIANS KILL PEOPLE. NO MORE STUDENT VISAS FOR MUSLIM STUDENTS.
Jon: SLOW DOWN CHOMSKY! SO THAT'S THEIR LIBERAL. WITH MORE ON THE FIVE, IT'S OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE. SAMANTHA, NICE TO SEE YOU. HELLO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, SAMANTHA, WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE THESE PANEL SHOWS LIKE THE FIVE BRING  TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE NEWS?
JON, I'M SORRY PLEASE DON'T COMPARE THE FIVE TO OTHER PANEL SHOWS. OKAY? THE FIVE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST A PANEL SHOW. IT'S LIFE ITSELF. IT IS EVERYTHING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM A PANEL SHOW, THEY SEEM LIKE...?
JON, PERHAPS YOU ARE UNACQUAINTED WITH MY ONE WOMAN SHOW INSPIRED BY THE FIVE. I SHALL NOW PERFORM IT FOR YOU.
Jon: ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK WE HAVE --
SHH-- EASY LITTLE JON, MAMA IS IN CONTROL NOW. [ LAUGHTER ] JON, THE FIVE IS THE STORYBOARD OF THE HUMAN CONDITION AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I AM SAMANTHA BEE, AND I WATCH THE FIVE. ♪  THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FIVE IS THAT IT'S A STORY AS OLD AS TIME, A STORY OF LOVE. [ LAUGHTER ] ONE THAT RIVALS THE WORKS OF A SHAKESPEARE OR A NICHOLAS SPARKS. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS STORY OF LOVE IS ROOTED IN THAT DEEPEST HUMAN EMOTION:  RIDING THE BONER TRAIN TO POUNDTOWN. [TRAIN SOUND] IT'S THE TALE OF A WINSOME BLONDE INGENUE, DANA PERINO  A YOUNG GIRL NEW TO THE BIG CITY WITH BIG DREAMS AND A HEART SO PURE SHE MAKES MARY POPPINS LOOK LIKE A DISGUSTING WHORE BAG. >>I AM IN BED ASLEEP BY 10:30
I'M DEFINITELY AWAKE BY 6:30. THERE'S A CERTAIN WORD THAT RHYMES WITH TRUCK. SHOULD THE DETAINEES BE GIVEN THE E WORD IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS NEXT ON THE FIVE.
EROTICA?
I CAN'T SAY THAT!
THE REASON THEY DON'T START FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT FINANCIALLY SECURE ENOUGH TO START A FAMILY YET, IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING S-E-X.
[GASP] SHE CAN'T SAY S-E-X. SHE'S NOT A (bleep) WORD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW NOBODY FALLS FOR A  GOOD GIRL HARDER THAN A BAD BOY. ♪  AND NO BOY WAS BADDER THAN THE REBEL-LICIOUS GREG GUTFELD.
I WAS ON PERCOCET FOR SEVEN DAYS. BEST WEEK OF MY LIFE.
I'M DRUNK NOW. I'VE BEEN DRINKING SINCE TWO. I GAVE THREE PEOPLE HEPATITIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
A PILL POPPING AFTERNOON DRUNK WHO'S RIDDLED WITH HEPATITIS? THERE'S GOT TO BE A CATCH! [LAUGHTER] GREG AND DANA WE'RE TOTAL  OPPOSITES. THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EVEN SEATED TOGETHER BUT ONCE THEY WERE, PSSSHH! ELECTRIC.
THESE BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS. I WANT TO GIVE THEM TO GREG. IT'S A PHOTO ROSE. YOU COULD HAVE THIS IN YOUR OFFICE. GREG WAS VERY CHIVALROUS AND GAVE ME HIS JACKET IN THE BREAK.   HOW DO I LAUGH AT ANYTHING YOU SAY? ONE LAST QUESTION TO GREG, IS POT AN APHRODISIAC? WHY DO YOU DO THAT TO ME? HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT POWER? [GIGGLING]
OH, YOU, OH, YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, A GIRL LIKE DANA SHE'S NOT GOING TO HAVE JUST ONE SUITOR.
IT'S A GAME OF HIGH STAKES INTERNATIONAL CHESS SO I PUT TOGETHER A BIG OLD CHESS BOARD RIGHT HERE. CAN CAMERA TWO TAKE THIS, CAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU AGREED TO WEAR
WE FIVERS WANT TO TAKE YOU THROUGH HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE FLU.
I HAVE TO DO THIS.
WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT KETCHUP?
REALLY ERIC BOLLING, PROP COMEDY? THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK ON DANA. THIS ISN'T 1980 AND YOU AIN'T NO GALLAGHER. [ LAUGHTER ] BESIDES GREG AND DANA'S LOVE COULDN'T BE DENIED. NOT THAT OTHERS DIDN'T TRY TO PULL THEM APART. [LAUGHTER] WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR STORY'S VILLAIN, A MAN WITH A SOUL SO DARK HE COULDN'T DIVIDE GREG AND DANA'S HAPPINESS. HE KNEW EXPOSING THEIR SECRET LOVE WOULD BE A SCANDAL THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAD NEVER SEEN. AND ON THE DAY THE FIVE WERE OUTSIDE GRILLING MEAT THAT'S JUST WHAT BOB BECKEL DID.
IF WE PUT GUTFELD ON HERE --
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST MEAT YOU'VE EVER HAD.
I'M SURE IT WOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT DANA TELLS ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BIG (bleep) MISTAKE, BOB. HOW ABOUT I TAKE THOSE SUSPENDERS AND HANG YOU BY YOUR BALLS? [LAUGHTER] BUT NONE OF IT MATTERED. IT WAS EMPTY, MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT GREG AND DANA HAD WORSE PROBLEMS THAN SCUM BOB BIG PANTS.
I WANT TO WISH A HAPPY 9th ANNIVERSARY TO MY WIFE ELENA.
HE HAS A WIFE? YOU HAVE A WIFE? THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU COULD HAVE MENTIONED IN THE THREE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN SITTING NEXT TO DANA. YOU TWO-TIMING MONSTER. LETTING DANA, PRECIOUS DANA FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU WHILE YOU ARE JUST GALLIVANTING AROUND YOUR STUPID STUDIO LAUGHING IT UP WITH YOUR SECRET WIFE. AND YOUR DICK PILLS. YOU KNOW WHAT? ALL THE WHILE BREAKING HER HEART YOU'VE BROKEN ALL OUR HEARTS HERE. JUST TAKE MINE I DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE. BURN IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] I DIE.
Jon: SO WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE VIEW? [LAUGHTER] OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S GOOD. IT'S IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN YOU ARE VACUUMING OR WHATEVER. OKAY. SAM. SAM BEE, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. SAM BEE.
