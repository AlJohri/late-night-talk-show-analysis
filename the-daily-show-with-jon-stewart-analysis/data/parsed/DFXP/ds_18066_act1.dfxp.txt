FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST IS DONNIE WAHLBERG  GOING TO BE JOINING US LATER ON  THE PROGRAM ON THE... LONNIE  ANDERSON. THAT'S THE WOMAN I WOULD BE.   ( APPLAUSE )   IF YOU CAN BE ANY ANIMAL, IF YOU  CAN BE ANY WOMAN BUT NOBODY EVER ASKED ME ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH  YOU? (LAUGHING)  A LITTLE BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING. LAST WEEK WE DID A VERY CLEVER  BIT ON OUR PROGRAM CALLED  19th CENTURY NEWS. WITHIN THE BIT WE HAD VERY WITTY  FUN CONCERNING MISSISSIPPI'S  JUST RECENTLY RATIFYING THE 13th AMENDMENT. AGREEING TO END SLAVERY, A MERE  148 YEARS AFTER. AFTER THE REST OF US. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, IF I AM  BRINGING UP SOMETHING THAT WE  DID ON THE SHOW LAST WEEK, I'M PROBABLY ABOUT TO APOLOGIZE FOR  IT. MAYBE I'M APOLOGIZING TO  MISSISSIPPI AS PAINTING IT TO  SOME KIND OF RELUCTANT ENTRANT TO MODERN MORALITY. YES, NO. IT CONCERNS A FORMER MISSISSIPPI  SECRETARY OF STATE WHO PRESIDED  OVER A 1995 ATTEMPT TO RATIFY THE 13th AMENDMENT. IT FAILED DUE TO A BUREAUCRATIC  SNAFU
THEIR FORMER SECRETARY OF  STATE FAILED TO SEND A COPY OF  THE RESOLUTION TO THE FEDERAL  REGISTRAR.
Jon: CLASSIC. HERE'S MY IMPRESSION OF HIM  MAILING MISSISSIPPI'S 13th  AMENDMENT RATIFICATION TO THE FEDERAL REGISTRAR. "SO GLAD WE DID THIS. THAT'S REALLY NICE. LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN THE  MAILBOX."  OH, WHAT FUN! LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT WE DID JUST  THERE. WE USED THE GENTLEMAN BY THE  NAME OF DICK MOLFUSS LARGELY  BECAUSE HIS NAME WAS DICK MOLFUSS AS AN AVITAR FOR CASUAL  BIGOTRY FORGETTING THAT PERHAPS  DICK MOLFUSS IS A REAL PERSON WITH A REAL RECORD ON CIVIL  RIGHTS. YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF,  COULDN'T YOU JUST LOOK THAT UP? YEAH, WE COULD HAVE. OR, OR WE COULD HAVE REMAINED  SMUGLY SATISFIED WITH THE FUNNY  NAME. WE WENT WITH B MAINLY BECAUSE I  AM A MADE 12-YEAR-OLD BOY  TRAPPED IN A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN'S  BODY. SO AS IT TURNS OUT DICK  MOLFUSS -- DON'T GET TICKLED BY  THE NAME, JOHNNY BOY -- IT TURNS OUT DICK MOLFUSS HAS A LONG AND  DISTINGUISHED RECORD OF SPEAKING  OUT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN  MISSISSIPPI. HE'S AN HONORABLE AND GOOD MAN. WHO IN THE '90s LED THE CHARGE  ON BIG VOTING RIGHTS REFORMS  THERE. IN 1989 HE SPOKE AT A 25th  ANNIVERSARY MEMORIAL FOR THE  THREE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS MURDERED OUTSIDE PHILADELPHIA  MISSISSIPPI DURING THE SUMMER, A  SPEECH THAT EARNED MR. MOLPUS DEATH THREATS. APPARENTLY BITTER RACISTS LIVE  LONGER THAN YOU WOULD THINK. ANYWAY, WE FOUND OUT ALL THIS,  I'D SAY, ABOUT A HALF HOUR AFTER  IT AIRED ON A THURSDAY NIGHT I MIGHT ADD. NOT THE BEST NIGHT FOR US TO  MAKE A MISTAKE. SINCERE APOLOGIES TO MR. MOLPUS. HE DID NOT ASK US FOR APOLOGIZE. NO ONE CONTACTED US TO COMPLAIN. MY GUESS IS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW  WE'RE ALIVE AND ARE PROBABLY TOO  BUSY TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS WORLD, TO CARE. WE APOLOGIZE BECAUSE, WELL, WE  LIKE TO BELIEVE THERE'S STILL A  LITTLE DICK MOLPUS IN ALL OF US. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   AND THAT EVEN ELITIST PRICKS  LIKE ME CAN SOMETIMES STILL PICK UP THAT 3:00 A.M. CONSCIENCE  WAKE-UP CALL AND THAT... (MUSIC). THAT SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD, MAN. WHAT'S NEXT ON THE SHOW?
THE COMMONWEALTH IS PREPARING  TO REPEAL A 136-YEAR-OLD LAW  THAT MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR UNMARRIED VIRGINIAN COUPLES TO  LIVE TOGETHER.
Jon: DAMN YOU, SOUTH. DO NOT MAKE ME [BLEEP] ON YOU. SO YOU'RE SAYING VIRGINIA'S NOT  REALLY FOR LOVERS? NEXT YOU'LL TELL ME MICHIGAN'S  NOT FOR BRINGING LEMONADE AND  CONDOMS TO SOMEONE WHO TURNS OUT TO BE NBC'S... WE'LL APOLOGIZE  TOMORROW. I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT WHEN  VIRGINIA PASSED THAT LAW IN  TONIGHT'S EPISODE OF "19th CENTURY NEWS."  HELLO, EVERYBODY. MY MOST HE'S TEEMED VIEWERS,  'TIS I YOUR HUMBLE HOST. MY GUEST TONIGHT FLORENCE  NIGHTINGALE. SHE'S WRITTEN A NEW BOOK ON  SOMETHING CALLED ANTISEPTICS AND  THEIR ROLE IN FIGHTING DEADLY INFECTIONS ON THE IRISH. FIRST THE 1800s PEOPLE. FIRST, A BRIEF WORD FROM OUR  SPONSOR. WHEN IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT AND YOU  DON'T HAVE TO BE ANYWHERE 'TIL  TUESDAY. ANYWAY, OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT,  VIRGINIA HAS BANNED LIVING IN  SIN. NO LONGER SHALL UNMARRIED MEN  AND WOMEN TERRORIZE OUR GOOD  STATE WITH THEIR PRIVATES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS RELATIONSHIP. IN TECHNOLOGY NEWS THERE'S A  BRAND NEW LABOR SAVING DEVICE ON  THE MARKET CALLED CHINESE  PEOPLE. CHINESE PEOPLE BECAUSE BUILDING  A RAILROAD IS EXPENSIVE. AND HARD. WOW. THAT SHOW IS SOMETHING. ISN'T IT? WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN THIS  COUNTRY. I CANNOT BELIEVE WE USED TO  EXPLOIT CHINESE LABOR TO BUILD  OUR TECHNOLOGY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   OF COURSE, THAT VIRGINIA NO  COHABITATION LAW PROBABLY HASN'T BEEN ENFORCED FOR 100 YEARS
IT HASN'T BEEN ENFORCED  APPARENTLY SINCE THE 1990s  WHEN DAY CARE OPERATOR DARLENE DAVIS HAD HER BUSINESS LICENSE  HELD UP BECAUSE SHE WAS LIVING  WITH HER MAN.
Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING  ME? THEY HAD TO BE STOPPED? MOST NORMAL STATES WOULD JUST BE  HAPPY THEY FOUND EACH OTHER. VIRGINIA, BUT THIS IS ONLY A  START IN VIRGINIA'S EFFORT TO  STAY CURRENT WITH THE LAST  CENTURY.
THE STATUE HAS BEEN ONE OF  THOSE LINGERING LEGAL  CURIOSITIES LIKE THE LAW AGAINST WASHING YOUR MULE ON THE  SIDEWALK, NO HUNTING ON SUNDAYS  AND OUR FAMOUS ANTI-SODOMY STATUTE SNIEM YOUR FAMOUS  ANTI-SODOMY STATUTE? YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE SAME WAY  MASONS TALKED ABOUT THEIR HOT  DOGS. VIRGINIA, COME FOR THE BEACHES. STAY BECAUSE WE INCARCERATED YOU  FORGETTING A BLOW JOB. AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST VICTORY  FOR THE STATE SENATOR WHO  SPEARHEADED THE REPEAL ADAM EVAN
HE HAS TARGETED OLD LAWS  BEFORE
I REPEALED THE LAW AGAINST  SERVING SANGRIA ABOUT SIX YEARS  AGO. WE'RE WORKING AT THEM ONE AT A  TIME.
Jon: WHY IS THAT GUY SO  FAMILIAR? WAIT A MINUTE. IS THAT THE SAME THE SAME MAN OF  THE SIDEWALK MULE WASHER STAND. VIRGINIA, STOP THAT MAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT
