Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO SMALL TOWN USA, A PLACE WHERE MOMS BAKE APPLE PIES FOR CHURCH ON -- SUNDAY. [ LAUGHTER ] AND OF COURSE POLITICS ARE A SLEAZY MUD SLINGING CRAP FEST AS JASON JONES REPORTS.
CORALVILLE, IOWA POPULATION 20,000. A SLEEPY TOWN STEEPED IN THE PAST. A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR NAME.
WHAT'S UP (bleep).
THE KIND OF TOWN WHERE YOU CAN STILL GET A SHAVE AT THE LOCAL DINER AND EVEN THE GRAFFITTI HAS HEART.  BUT IN THEIR LAST ELECTION THINGS GOT NASTY. MAYOR JOHN LUNDEL.
I'VE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL ELECTIONS. I WELCOME OPPONENTS BUT THEY BROUGHT AN ERA OF UGLINESS TO THIS CAMPAIGN THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE RUN OUR GOVERNMENT.
WHAT WAS SO BAD ABOUT WHAT THEY DID?
THEY DID SEVERAL DIRECT MAILS TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN CORALVILLE FULL OF VERY MISLEADING I WOULD CALL LIES THAT SOMEHOW I MANIPULATED MY PROPERTY TAXES AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO BECOME THE NEXT DETROIT.
ARE YOU GOING TO BECOME THE NEXT DETROIT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE A MAN WHO MANIPULATED HIS PROPERTY TAXES.
WELL THAT'S NOT TRUE.
OK WELL THE DIRECT MAILER WITH THE SILVER PLATTER SAYS OTHERWISE.
THE COMMUNITY WAS VERY ANGRY.
WELL I WOULD BE ANGRY TOO IF YOU WERE TURNING MY TOWN INTO DETROIT.
UHHH, CRAP.
AND JUST WHO WAS SLINGING ALL THIS MUD AT INCUMBENTS LIKE MAYOR LUNDELL? ENTER CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATE CHRIS TURNER.
THE INCUMBENTS LOVE CORALVILLE.  THEY ARE NOT CROOKS. I HAPPEN TO DISAGREE WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY WANT TO SPEND TAX MONEY ON BUT THEY ARE NICE PEOPLE.
HOLD UP A SECOND, I'M CONFUSED. YOU DIDN'T CALL THEM NAMES?
NO, I KNOW THEM THEY ARE NICE GUYS.
IT TURNS OUT THESE WERE THE GUYS SLINGING MUD: THE KOCH BROTHERS AND THEIR GIANT SUPERPAC AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY.  TIRED OF LOSING IN BIG NATIONAL ELECTIONS, THEY ARE EMBRACING A NEW STRATEGY OF BUYING WINS IN LOCAL RACES USING NATIONAL STYLE CUT THROAT TACTICS.  AND FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE TURNER WAS OVERWHELMED BY THEIR SUPPORT.
YEAH, WHEN AFP CAME TO TOWN IT'S KIND OF LIKE GETTING ENDORSED BY CHARLES MANSON.. THEIR TACTICS WERE JUST REPREHENSIBLE. IT PUT ME IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.
THE POSITION OF BEING A WINNER.
I GOT TIED FOR LAST.
IN FACT DESPITE THEIR TENACITY THE KOCHS DIDN'T WIN A SINGLE CANDIDATE. WHY DIDN'T THE YOKELS WANT TO EMBRACE THE FUTURE OF SMALL TOWN ATTACK AD POLITICS? BIG CITY SUPER PAC SYMPATHIZER MATTHEW VADIM.
IF THEY WANT BE CLOSED MINDED GOD BLESS THEM. >>I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH ATTACK ADS.
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE FROM A SMALL TOWN WHO MIGHT ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE LIES WE'RE SEEING?
I'M NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE PREMISE OF YOUR QUESTION.
RIGHT.
SOMETIMES THEY ARE LIES AND SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE SCURRILOUS RUMORS AND INNUENDO AND SOMETIMES IT'S VALUABLE EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL.
SO IT'S THEIR JOB TO FIGURE IT OUT.
PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALLOWED TO TRY TO EFFECT GOVERNMENT.
WITH SLEAZY POLITICS.
SOME MAN'S SLEAZE IS ANOTHER MAN'S CLASS.
SO HOW SHOULD SLEAZY BIG CITY OPERATIVES TALK TO CLASSY SMALL TOWN FOLKS?
THERE HAS TO BE A BIT OF SALESMANSHIP WHEN YOU ARE PROMOTING A POINT OF VIEW OR NOBODY IS GOING TO LISTEN TO  YOU. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SHOWBIZ.
MAYBE THAT'S JUST WHAT THE BORING ISSUES-BASED CORALVILLE CITY COUNCIL NEEDED.
ITEM THREE APPROVED THE AGENDA. MOTION PLEASE.  >>I'LL MOVE. >>SECOND. ITEM NUMBER FOUR--
WHAT IS THIS I HEAR ABOUT THE BIG CITY SUPER PAC GOING AWAY.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE BIG CITY STRANGER WITH THE TOP HAT AND CANE HAS TO SAY?
WHO ME. YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ELECTION STRATEGIES FROM ME. NO THAT'S MORE OF AN OSCALOOSA IDEA. SUPER PAC.
WHAT?
SUPER PAC.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WEEEELLL, I BELIEVE IN BASEBALL, DOUBLE BACON CORN DOGS, APPLE PIE AND ALL THAT SMALL TOWN TALKING POINT CRAP BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN CHUCK NORRIS ROBOCALLS PAID FOR BY THE KOCH BROTHERS SUPER PAC. THESE GUYS ARE GREAT. THEY'RE GREAT, THEY'RE, RICH THEY'RE WHITE AND OLD AND POSSIBLY ZOMBIES NOW FOLKS LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN. THESE KOCHS HAVE ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX HUGE CORPORATIONS  ALL OF WHICH GOT TOGETHER TO FORM THE KOCH BROTHERS SUPER PAC WITH CAPITAL GAINS THAT RHYMES WITH BRAINS WHICH ALL OF YOU LACK. OH WE NEED A SUPER PAC. RIGHT HERE IN CORALVILLE. WITH A CAPITAL C AND ITS 4 LETTERS: ORALVILLE. I WAS TOLD YOU LIKED SHOWBIZ AND COULD BE SWAYED BY SONG AND DANCE WHICH YOU CAN'T OBVIOUSLY. OK I GUESS THEY JUST WEREN'T READY FOR THE BIG TIME AND NEITHER  WAS THE LOSER OF THE RACE.
I'M PRETTY SATISFIED WITH HOW IT ENDED. LIKE I SAID, I WANT THEM TO GO AWAY.
YOU KNOW HONESTLY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE KOCH BROTHERS SAW IN YOU.
YEAH NEITHER DO I. [LAUGHTER]
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A CANDIDATE LIKE CHRIS TURNER WHO IS ANTI-GOVERNMENT WASTE WHO SAID I'M ACTUALLY GLAD I LOST.
YOU'VE TAKEN THE WRONG LESSON FROM THIS.
WHAT IS THE RIGHT LESSON?
THE RIGHT -- I WOULD SAY THE RIGHT LESSON... [LAUGHTER] -- LET ME THINK ABOUT IT FOR A  MOMENT.
TAKE YOUR TIME. [ LAUGHTER ]
UM, -- [LAUGHTER] THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO ABOUT ANOTHER GROUP COMING IN.
THERE YOU GO. YOU ARE (bleep).
I GUESS THAT'S THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? FORGET ABOUT IT.
FORGET ABOUT IT, CORALVILLE. FUGGEDABOUTIT.
Jon: JASON JONES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
