( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK  EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR  TUNING IN TONIGHT BECAUSE, FRANKLY, WAL KNOW WHAT TIME OF  YEAR IT IS.
SHARK WEEK. IT'S A BAD WEEK TO BE A SEAL.
John: THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S "SHARK WEEK" THE SEVEN-DAY  CELEBRATION OF THE OCEAN'S  GREATEST PREDATOR, THANKS TO GREAT SHARK PIONEERS LIKE MARTIN  LUTHER FIN AND THE LEGENDARY  RECOVERY SHOCKS. SHE WOULD NOT SWIM TO THE BACK  OF THE TANK. SHE WOULD NOT DO IT. AND THIS YEAR, DISCOVERY CHANNEL  KICKED THE WEEK OFF WITH A TRULY  AMAZING DOCUMENTARY.
MEGALATON, THE SERIAL KILLER  OF THE SEAS. WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING ARE THE  ACTUAL EVENTS AS THEY UNFOLDED.
I SAW A BIG SHADOW BEHIND ME,  AND THE CAGE STARTED SHAKING  LIKE CRAZY.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON  BACK HERE.
THE CAGE IS DONE.
DID YOU SEE THAT.
THE CAGE IS GONE.
John: WOW THE DISCOVERY  CHANNEL ACTUALLY DISCOVERED  SOMETHING. THEY FOUND AN ACTUAL LIVING,  PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE AND I  THINK MEGALADON. THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME NOBEL  PRIZE FOR FISHING. UNLESS-- I'M SORRY, I'M HEARING  THERE IS LATE-BREAKING NEWS.
THERE'S A "SHARK WEEK"  CONTROVERSY OR SHOULD WE SAY  SHARK-ROW-VERSEY.
John: NO, YOU SHOULD NEVER  SAY THAT, THOSE WORDS SHOULD  NEVER PASS YOUR FACE, UNLESS MAYBE BEFORE GOING ON AIR YOU  READ YOUR SCRIPT AND SAY WHO PUT  SHARK-ROW-VERSEY IN MY ( BLEEP )  SCRIPT. HAVING SAID THAT, I HAVE TO ASK,  WHAT IS THE SHARK-ROW-VERSEY.
THE MEGULADON IS AND I THINK. THIS WASN'T ISRAELI A  DOCUMENTARY, BUT A  DRAMATIZATION, IF YOU WILL, A  FAKE DOCUMENTARY. THEY DID RUN A DISCLAIMER ON THE  SHOW FOR, LIKE, THREE SECONDS.
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
John: WAIT, WAIT! YOU FAKED A TWO-HOUR SHOW, AND  YOUR DISCLAIMER WAS THREE  SECONDS AT THE END? YOU KNOW NO ONE SAW THOSE  BLINKING LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM OF  THE SCREEN, DON'T YOUUC BECAUSET END OF THE SHOW THEY WERE TOO  BUSY CALLING THEIR FLEEMS  SAYING, "GET THE HELL OUT OF  OCEAN! GET OUT OF THE SWIMMING POOL! GET OUT OF THE VODKA! THERE'S A MONSTER SHARK! THERE'S A MONSTER SHARK!"  THAT  LEVEL OF DIPLICITY, DISCOVERY  MUST BE PRETTY ASHAMED OF  THEMSELVES. I AM SURE THEY ISSUED A  MEGA-LA-POL GEE.
THEY ALMOST FLAUNTED THE FACT  THAT THEY DUPED VIEWERS PUT THE  POLL ON THEIR WEB SITE SHOWING 73% OF PEOPLE BELIEVED THIS  MONSTER SHARK STILL EXISTED.
John: WHY DID EVERYONE  THINK THAT? BECAUSE YOU SAID THEY WERE REAL. THE FACT THAT 73% OF PEOPLE  BELIEVE YOU DOESN'T MAKE THEM�i  STUPID. IT MAKES THEM TRUSTY GOOD  PEOPLE. IT'S ACTUALLY HEARTWARMING TO ME  THAT MANY OF THEM BELIEVE YOU,  GIVEN THAT YOU'RE THE NETWORK BEHIND SHOWS LIKE "AMISH MAUVE  QA" AND "MARIJUANA�r PORN WEED  COUNTRY" AS WELL AS "NAKED�� AND AFRAID-- WHERE YOU CAN LEARN TO  CATCH FISH WITH YOUR VAGINA. DISCOVERY KNOWS GIVE A WOMAN A  FISH AND SHE'LL EAT FOR A DAY. HEECH TERHAD FISH WITH HER  VAGINA AND YOU HAVE GOT
