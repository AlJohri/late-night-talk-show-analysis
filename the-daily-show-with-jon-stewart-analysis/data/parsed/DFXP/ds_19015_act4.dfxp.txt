Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, DIANE RAVITCH, AUTHOR OF REIGN OF ERROR, YOU DID FORGET THE T, I DON'T KNOW WHO PROOFREAD THIS, SO THEY SAY THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL IS GOOD, BUT CLEARLY IT'S A DICHOTOMY. IN PLACES THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY FLOURISHING THE SCHOOLS ARE VERY GOOD IN PLACES THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING THE SCHOOLS STRUGGLE. SO IT CLEARLY IS TIED TO THAT BUT I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET YOU, YOU ARE A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF TEACHERS AND TEACHERS DESERVE THAT. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT JOBS IN THE COUNTRY. BUT ISN'T IT-- ISN'T IT POSSIBLE--  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT-- THAT WHILE WE VIEW, WE HAVE TO VIEW THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND THAT ANY INSTITUTION INCLUDING THE UNION CAN FIND ITSELF BECOMING TOO RIGID AND DOGMATIC. IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU WOULD CHANGE ABOUT THAT  STRUCTURE?
WELL, I THINK THAT UNIONS ARE WILLING TO COMPROMISE, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER EVERY UNION CONTRACT IS NOT DICTATED BY THE UNION. THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE AT THE TABLE. ONE SIDE IS MANAGEMENT, THE OTHER IS UNION. AND MANAGEMENT SHOULD SAY LOOK, WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF BAD TEACHERS. BUT THE ONE THING THAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD NEVER SAY, ARNIE DUNCAN FORCES THEM TO SAY THESE DAYS, IS TEACHERS SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY TEST SCORES. THE TEST SCORES OF THEIR STUDENTS DEPEND A LOT ON WHO THE STUDENTS ARE. IF THEY ARE AUTISTIC KIDS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE HIGH TEST SCORES. IF THEY ARE KIDS LEARNING ENGLISH THEY ARE NOT GOING HAVE HIGH TEST SCORES. TEACHERS SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY TEST SCORES. THEY SHOULD BE JUDGED BY THEIR PEERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE, WISER THAN THEY ARE. BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED BY TEST SCORES. THERE ARE MANY GOOD WAYS TO EVALUATE TEACHERS.
Jon: IS THERE AN AREA THAT IS DOING IT RIGHT IN YOUR MIND IN THE COUNTRY TODAY? IS THERE A MUNICIPALITY, A STATE, SOMEBODY THAT IS DOING IT IN A MANNER THAT YOU THINK YEAH, THAT'S THE FUTURE MODEL? BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE, LIKE IN BROOKLYN THEY HAVE THIS PTEC. IT IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT IS FOCUSED MORE ON THE VOCATIONAL ASPECT OF THE MODERN WORLD. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A BAD IDEA.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST STARTING SO WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES. I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH VERMONT. I WAS JUST IN VERMONT. IN VERMONT THEY HAVE NO CHARTERS. THEY CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THE KIDS AND HAVE THE HIGHEST GRADUATION RATE IN THE COUNTRY AND KEEP SAYING WE CAN DO BETTER. MORE THAN 90% OF THEIR KIDS ARE ALREADY GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY KEEP SAYING WE CAN DO BETTER AND THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED ON TEST SCORES. THEY'RE FOCUSED ON THE COMMUNITY, THE WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN, THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN. THOSE THINGS MATTER A LOT. SO I THINK THAT'S GOOD. THE OTHER PLACE THAT I HAVE SEEN WHERE I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WAS SAN DIEGO. BECAUSE IN SAN DIEGO INSTEAD OF DOING A SEARCH AND BRINGING OUT ONE OF THE SAME OLD FOLKS TO BE SUPERINTENDENT, THEY PICKED THE BEST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND SHE WAS SHOCKED BUT SHE IS TERRIFIC. AND SO I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH SAN DIEGO.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE, IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO IT WHEN IT NEVER RAINS AND LIFE IS PERFECT. (LAUGHTER) THIS TESTING REGIME, IS THE IDEA THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE OR THAT THEIR STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE ART OF TEACHING, NOT JUST THE SCIENCE OF TEACHING.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK CONGRESS SHOULD MANDATE ANY TESTING. I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY OUT OF THE REALM OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY THINGS THEY LEGISLATE ABOUT WHERE THEY KNOW NOTHING. THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SCHOOL REFORM SO CONGRESS SHOULD GET OUT OF IT. (APPLAUSE) BUT AS FAR AS TESTING GOES, THE BEST TEST IS THE TEST THAT A TEACHER MAKES UP. BECAUSE THE TEACHER KNOWS WHAT HE OR SHE WAS TEACHING. AND THEY CAN TEST IT AND THEY CAN GET THE ANSWERS RIGHT AWAY. AND FIND OUT HOW TO HELP THE KIDS. TESTING ONLY HAS ONE PURPOSE AND THAT IS TO HELP KIDS. SO THE TEACHER CAN LOOK AND SAY OH, JOHNNY NEEDS MORE HELP WITH FRACTIONS, I CAN GIVE THAT HELP. THE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO FIND OUT I THOUGHT I TAUGHT THAT, NO ONE LEARNED IT, I DIDN'T TEACH IT VERY WELL. WHAT WE HAVE NOW WITH THE STANDARDIZED TEST, THE INDUSTRY, THE STANDARDIZED TESTING IS GROWING FATTER BY THE DAY, CONSULTANTS GROWING FATTER BY THE DAY. THE KIDS TAKE THE TEST IN THE SPRING. THE RESULTS COME IN, IN AUGUST AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE SAME TEACHER ANY MORE. AND THE TEACHERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT AND WHAT THEY GOT WRONG. MEANING HAD THAT THE TEST HAVE ZERO VALUE. ZERO, OTHER THAN FOR THE TESTING COMPANIES.
Jon: RIGHT. THAT'S THE WAY-- I MEAN, NOT TO MENTION, WHAT IF ITS CHILD'S NAME IS NOT JOHNNY. I MEAN IT THROWS THE WHOLE REALM OF IT OFF.
IT'S TRUE FOR MARIA ALSO.
Jon: THIS HAS, IN MY MIND WHEN YOU TALK TO TEACHERS IT IS SO DISSPIRITING TO THEM, THIS IDEA THAT THEY ARE JUST GIVEN THIS CORE CURRICULUM THAT THEY MUST TEACH TO AND IT PUTS THEM INSIDE A BOX THAT STEALS-- YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO A JOB LIKE THAT LOOK, I DEAL WITH MY KIDS FOR JUST LIKE 40 MINUTES IN THE MORNING. AND I'M READY TO, LIKE, GO TO THE TEACHERS LOUNGE AND GET HIGH, LIKE THAT. (LAUGHTER) SO THEY'RE OUT THERE THEY'RE BANGING IT OUT. TO STEAL THE CREATIVITY AND JOY AND INSPIRATION THAT THEY MIGHT BRING TO THE PROCESS, SEEMS LIKE A REAL CRIMINAL ACT.
THERE ARE TWO CRIMES HERE, ONE IS THE CRIME AGAINST THE TEACHERS. BECAUSE TEACHERS WANT TO TEACH. THEY BECOME TEACHERS AND EVERY ONE I HAVE EVER TALKED TO SAYS THE SAME THING. I BECAME A TEACHER BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF CHILDREN. AND THEN THEY'RE GIVEN A SCRIPT. SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE, AS YOU PUT IT. THEY LOSE THEIR PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY. I MEAN THE COMMON CORE WHICH IS THE CURRICULUM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS AN ANSWER TO A PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE. WE HAVE A PROBLEM OF POVERTY AND THE COMMON CORE DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM. BUT THE SECOND CRIME IS AGAINST CHILDREN. BECAUSE WE'RE NOW SO FOCUSED ON TESTING THAT WE ARE REWARDING THE KIDS WHO CAN PICK THE RIGHT BOX. AND WHAT WE NEED FOR THE 21st CENTURY IS THE KIDS WHO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX, NOT INSIDE THE BOX. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I WILL SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU TALKED ABOUT THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THE WAY THAT THEY ARE COMMODITIZING, MAYBE, EDUCATION. I DO, I'VE MET SOME PEOPLE WITHIN THAT SYSTEM. THEY ARE-- THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE THERE WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT KIDS. AND WHO DON'T VIEW IT AS A METHOD TO BUSINESS SUCCESS BUT ARE REALLY GOOD HEARTED INDIVIDUALS. YOU MAY DISAGREE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE METHODOLOGY BUT I WOULD JUST TO NUANCE THAT A LITTLE BIT AND SAY LIKE THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SPECIAL PEOPLE.
I HAVE MET SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE IN THE CHARTER SECTOR. AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT DOWN THE WHOLE SECTOR. WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS IT'S PART OF A LARGER PICTURE WHERE WE NOW HAVE WITHOUT ANYBODY EVER VOTING FOR VOUCHERS, 17 STATES WITH VOUCHERS. AND THAT MEANS KIDS ARE USING PUBLIC MONEY TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS, RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS THAT TEACH CREATIONISM AND SCHOOLS THAT TEACH THAT THE DINOSAURS AND THE PEOPLE LIVED AT THE SAME TIME. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY LIVED HAPPILY OR NOT.
Jon: NOW IS THAT ON THE TEST, BECAUSE I DON'T--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOU, COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN SOON, REIGN OF ERROR, ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, DIANE
