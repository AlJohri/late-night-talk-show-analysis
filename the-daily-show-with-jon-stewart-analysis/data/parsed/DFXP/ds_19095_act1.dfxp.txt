FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT. NEW YORK MET GREAT MOOKIE WILSON WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. THEY ARE NOT BOOING THEY ARE MOOKIE-ING. BUT FIRST THE WOUNDS OF CENTURIES OF RACIAL OPPRESSION HAVE LONG HAUNTED OUR COUNTRY A TRAGIC BUT INESCAPABLE PART OF THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN THE SUPREME COURT SAID ITS OKAY FOR STATES TO BAN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES THUS COMPLETING THE MISSION OF RACIAL HEALING THIS COURT EMBARKED ON LAST YEAR.
THE SUPREME COURT ESSENTIALLY KNOCKED DOWN ONE OF PILLARS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IT INVALIDATED A KEY PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, THE LAW ENACTED IN 1965 TO STOP RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AT THE POLLS.
AS CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SAID NEARLY 50 YEARS LATER THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
Jon: RACISM IS OVER! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, THE JUSTICES WERE JUST CODIFYING WHAT MANY OF US HAD KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
AMERICA TREATS PEOPLE EQUALLY. WE HAVE A BLACK PRESIDENT. EUROPE EVEN HAS NEVER HAD A BLACK PRESIDENT.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR LIBERALS THERE'S NO RACISM IN AMERICA. THERE'S MORE CHOLERA IN AMERICA THAN THERE IS RACISM.
Jon: MORE CHOLERA, YES, RACISM HAS GONE THE WAY OF (bleep) WHERE YOU DRINK. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT RACISM IS OFFICIALLY DEAD.
I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE KNOW ABOUT THE NEGRO --
Jon: WHAT? JUST DAYS AFTER BEING DECLARED DEAD BY THE SUPREME COURT RACISM HAS ARISEN. IT'S A WEEK AFTER EASTER MIRACLE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT THAT EASTER WEEKEND ITSELF DIDN'T PROVIDE CLUES THAT PERHAPS RACISM WASN'T QUITE AS DEAD AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS.
EASTER EGGS FILLED WITH WORDS OF HATE.
PARENTS IN THE WEST END ARE OUTRAGED AFTER WAKING UP TO FIND EASTER EGGS FILLED WITH RACIST NOTES.
Jon: HUH. I THOUGHT THE EASTER BUNNY LOOKED DIFFERENT THIS YEAR.  [LAUGHTER] AND OF COURSE, RACISM LIKE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN RESURRECTED QUICKLY CAUGHT ON WITH MANY JEWS.
DON'T COME TO MY GAMES. DON'T BRING BLACK PEOPLE AND DON'T COME.
IT BOTHERS ME A LOT THAT YOU WANT TO BROADCAST THAT YOU ARE ASSOCIATING WITH BLACK PEOPLE.
I'M JUST SAYING, IN YOUR LOUSY (bleep) INSTAGRAMS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YOURSELF WITH, WALKING WITH BLACK PEOPLE. [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Jon: THAT IS A DONALD STERLING. THAT IS DONALD STERLING. HE'S A BILLIONAIRE WHO HAS GOTTEN RICH OFF THE LABORS OF A MOSTLY BLACK BASKETBALL TEAM TELLING HIS MIXED RACE GIRLFRIEND NOT TO BE SEEN WITH BLACK PEOPLE. IT'S THAT AGE OLD STORY, "YEAH, I'M RACIST BUT MY (bleep) AND MY WALLET ARE NOT." BY THE WAY, [ LAUGHTER ] BEING SEEN WITH BLACK PEOPLE APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY RESTRICTION STERLING IS PLACING.
YOU CAN SLEEP WITH THEM, YOU CAN BRING THEM IN, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT. THE LITTLE I ASK YOU IS NOT TO PROMOTE IT AND NOT TO BRING THEM TO MY GAMES.
Jon: HE IS A RARE CREATURE. A RACIST SWINGER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT HE BASICALLY IS SAYING IS I DON'T SEE COLOR WHO IT COMES TO WHO YOU ARE (bleep). I ONLY SEE IT WHEN IT COMES TO WHO YOU ARE SITTING WITH. IF YOU THINK AN OLD MAN TELLING HIS GIRLFRIEND IT'S COOL IF SHE BANGS WHOEVER SHE WANTS IS THE WEIRDEST PART OF THIS STORY, THINK AGAIN.
STERLING WAS DUE TO RECEIVE A SECOND LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE NAACP NEXT MONTH FOR HIS WORK WITH UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTH BUT ON MEET THE PRESS TODAY THE NAACP INTERIM PRESIDENT SET THAT WON'T HAPPEN.
Jon: TAKE THAT STERLING.  NOT JOHN STERLING. JOHN STERLING IS AN THE ANNOUNCER OF YANKEES. DIFFERENT GUYS. THAT STERLING. BECAUSE OF YOUR UNREPENTENT RACISM YOU ONLY GET ONE NCAACP LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD -- NA DOUBLE C P -- NA DOUBLE -- IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S ONE MORE THING WE SHOULD ADD.
NO, I'M NOT RACIST BUT I DID WONDER THAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR RACE IS. WE NEED TO GET OVER THIS PREJUDICE.
STERLING TOGETHER WITH THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION SAY THE VIEWS ON THE RECORDINGS DO NOT REFLECT STERLING'S OWN PERSONAL BELIEFS.
Jon: THANK YOU. SOMEONE HAS TO FINALLY STAND UP FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO MAKING CLEARLY RACIST STATEMENTS ON TAPE AS NOT BEING RACIST. AND SINCE NO ONE ELSE WILL DO IT IT MIGHT AS WELL BE THE RACISTS THEMSELVES. THAT IS THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE A BLENDER. POT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'VE GOT ME ALL WRONG. I WOULD NEVER BE BLACK. BUT WAIT -- HOW DID THESE INCREDIBLY NOT RACIST PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF HAVING TO EXPLAIN HOW RACIST THEY AREN'T.
THE MEDIA MAYBE TWISTS THING A LITTLE BIT.
YOU GUYS TRY TO MAKE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD THINK I'M PREJUDICED. I'M NOT PREJUDICED.
Jon: AH THE MEDIA IS TWISTING IT AROUND TO MAKE YOU SEEM -- THEY'RE JUST TAKING IT OVER HERE, TAKING IT OVER HERE -- BLOOP. I MEAN IF THEY WOULD JUST PLAY THE WHOLE TAPE THEY WOULD SEE HE SAYS THE NEGRO MAY HAVE BEEN BETTER UNDER SLAVERY WHICH IS A LINE HE WROTE IN A NEW PLAY CALLED LES MISERACISTS. SO IF YOU KNOW ANY JEW THEATER PRODUCERS -- WHAT STOP TWISTING MY WORDS! NOW, OF COURSE, DONALD STERLING HAS YET TO EXPLAIN WHY HE IS NOT TO BLAME FOR HIS RACIST STATEMENTS. BUT ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE DONALD IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUGGEST -- WAIT -- [LAUGHTER] -- MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUGGEST STERLING IS NOT THE ONLY ONE AT FAULT HERE.
HE GOT SET UP BY A VERY, VERY BAD GIRLFRIEND, LET'S FACE IT. SHE WAS BAITING HIM. SHE'S A TERRIBLE HUMAN BEING AND SHE'S CALLED THE GIRLFRIEND FROM HELL.
Jon: THAT'S WHY I RECOMMEND TO ALL MY WEALTHY OLD FRIENDS THAT THEY DATE TRUMP BRAND GOLD DIGGING GIRLFRIENDS. I PROMISE THE BEST GIRLFRIENDS GOLD DIGGING MONEY CAN BUY. RETURN POLICY CAN'T BE BEAT. WHO AM I KIDDING? WE ALL KNOW WHERE THE BLAME FOR RACISM REALLY BELONGS.
IF I SAY NEGRO OR BLACK BOY OR SLAVE, I'M NOT -- IF THOSE PEOPLE CANNOT TAKE THOSE KIND OF WORDS AND NOT BE OFFENSIVE THEN MARTIN LUTHER KING HASN'T GOT HIS JOB DONE YET.
Jon: YEAH! IT'S HIS FAULT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DID THAT GUY QUIT BEFORE FINISHING HIS JOB? [LAUGHTER] SOMEBODY SHOULD CALL HIM AND TELL HIM TO STOP SLACKING AND GET BACK TO WORK ON THE JOB OF ENDING RACISM. HERE IS THE THING ABOUT RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY, THE REACTION TO STERLING AND BUNDY, THE OVERWHELMING CONDEMNATION MAKES IT CLEAR WE HAVE MADE ENORMOUS PROGRESS IN TEACHING EVERYONE THAT RACISM IS BAD. WHERE WE SEEM TO HAVE DROPPED THE BALL IS IN TEACHING PEOPLE WHAT RACISM ACTUALLY IS, WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SAY THESE INCREDIBLY RACIST THINGS WHILST INSISTING THEY WOULD NEVER. I BELIEVE THE BEST ENCAPSULATION OF THIS COGNITIVE DISSONANCE COMES IN ALMOST CARTOON FORM. I GIVE YOU TWO KLANSMEN DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM A MURDEROUS WHITE SUPREMACIST WHO WENT ON A SHOOTING SPREE AT A JEWISH CENTER.
WE ARE NOT A HATE GROUP.  I HAVE A LOT OF BLACK FRIENDS. I DO BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO LAYING DOWN WITH THEM WE SHOULD BE SEPARATE. BUT AS FOR AS A HATE GROUP, WE DID NOT HATE ANYONE.
Jon: OH, SO I GUESS THE ROBES   ARE A KIND OF A KITSCH HIPSTER THING. YOU ARE NOT KLANSMEN YOU ARE IN "KLANSMEN." COME BACK TO MY PLACE I'VE GOT SOME VINTAGE MOLOTOV COCKTAILS IN REAL 40s MILK BOTTLES. AND THAT BURNING CROSS? RECLAIMED FREE TRADE BARN WOOD. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE REAL KEY HERE WAS THEIR STATEMENT THAT THEY HAVE BLACK FRIENDS, THEY JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN SEXUAL MIXING, WHICH SHOWS, I THINK, THE RICH TAPESTRY, THE GORGEOUS MOSAIC OF RACISM IN AMERICA, ALL THE WAY FROM THOSE WHO SAY YOU CAN (bleep) THEM, JUST DON'T BE SEEN WITH THEM TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU CAN BE SEEN WITH THEM, JUST DON'T (bleep) THEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
