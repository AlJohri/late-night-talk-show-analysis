[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT CONGRESSWOMAN FROM FLORIDA ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. HER BOOK IS CALLED "FOR THE NEXT GENERATION, A WAKE UP TO SOLVING OUR NATION'S PROBLEMS." PLEASE WELCOME DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU, TOO.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
HANGING IN THERE.
Jon: HOW IS THINGS GOING BUSY?
A LITTLE INTENSE. A COUPLE THINGS GOING ON.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "FOR THE NEXT GENERATION." WHICH CLEARLY SAYS TO ME YOU HAVE GIVEN UP ON OUR GENERATION. OUR GENERATION HAS SO DISAPPOINTED YOU YOU THOUGHT WELL FORGET THEM YOU GUYS TAKE CARE OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
GOTTA AT LEAST TRY TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. IF WE CAN'T SALVAGE THIS ONE.
YES.
Jon: YOU ARE A PROPONENT OF GOVERNMENT'S ROLE OBVIOUSLY IN HELPING TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES, SAFETY NET. I BELIEVE I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT PREMISE. HAS THIS BEEN A GOOD RUN FOR THAT BELIEF SYSTEM? [LAUGHTER] OR A SLIGHTLY COLD WATER/GATORADE.
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BUMPY FOR THOSE OF US THAT THINK THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALL OF THE PROBLEM AND CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY CAN BE A POSITIVE FORCE IN PEOPLES' LIVES BUT WE CAN'T RELY ON GOVERNMENT FOR EVERYTHING. WE HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE.
Jon: IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE BOY DID THE REPUBLICANS. THEY HANDED THE DEMOCRATS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY BY BEING CRAZY PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL --
Jon: AND THEN SO YOU COULD HAVE ESTABLISHED THIS. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT IN THE MECHANISM IS GOING WRONG AND IS THIS TOO LARGE AN ISSUE FOR GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED IN? WHAT HAPPENED? YOU WOULD THINK BECAUSE I CHAIRED THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE REPUBLICANS HANDED US THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. POLITCALLY I THINK THEY DID THEMSELVES SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE. BUT THE REALITY IS THEY DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED OUR ECONOMY, THEY BROKE GOVERNMENT EVEN WORSE THAN PEOPLE THINK IT ALREADY IS AND WE'VE GOT TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK. THE MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY  POLITICS HAS TO STOP.
Jon: THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY I SPEAK OF.
EXACTLY.
Jon: THEIR BEHAVIOR OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NIHILISTIC THAT BEING SAID HOW DO THE DEMOCRATS SEIZE THAT MANTLE OF COMPETENCE AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS?
I HOPE WHEN PEOPLE READ MY BOOK THAT THEY TREAT IT AS A ROAD MAP FOR HOW THEY CAN GET ENGAGED. WE NEED REAL PEOPLE TO SOUND AN ALARM BELL. TOO MANY POLITICIANS ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE STRANGLED BY THE TEA PARTY. THE TAIL IS WAGGING THE DOG.
Jon:I THOUGHT YOU WERE  GOING TO SAY THEY WERE ROBOTS. GOWHEN YOU SAID WE NEED REALS. PEOPLE
THEY HAVE ROBOTIC LIKE TENDENCIES. I UNDERSTAND IT CAN'T ALWAYS BE MY WAY. YOU HAVE TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND WORK TOGETHER. WE NEED REAL PEOPLE WE NEED MOMS TO GET INVOLVED WHETHER IT'S EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE OR IMMIGRATION REFORM OR THE ECONOMY. AND CHOOSE THE ISSUE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THE MOST. AND TRY TO  INFLUENCE AND GET INVOLVED IN THAT ISSUE SO THEY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BECAUSE IF WE LET THESE THINGS GO OUR KIDS ARE REALLY GOING TO SUFFER.
Jon: OBSTRUCTIONISM ASIDE AND I KNOW IT MAKES IT HARDER AND CERTAINLY FOR THEM THEY HAVE NO STAKE IN SEEING IT SUCCEED. KNOWING THAT THAT IS PART OF THE EQUATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK WENT WRONG ON THE -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE DEMOCRAT SIDE BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE WHERE THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ROLL OUT THIS INCREDIBLE INITIATIVE FOR HEALTH CARE GOES SO SOUTH WHEN IT COULD HAVE REALLY, NOT PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF OBSTRUCTIONISM BUT DEMONSTRATED THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO BE HELPFUL TO THE CITIZENS.
ANY TIME YOU HAVE A MAJOR CHANGE IN ANY SYSTEM LIKE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, WE KNOW THERE ARE GOING TO BE KINKS AND BUMPS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT WE SHOULD BE -- WE ALL HAVE ATO AGREE ON ONE BASIC PREMISE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET REPUBLICANS TO AGREE ON THAT BASIC PREMISE THEY ARE HELL BENT ON THROWING EVERY OBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. YES, THERE'S KINKS BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT, WHEN YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE IMPLEMENTING A LAW, YOU WORK TOGETHER TO IRON OUT THOSE PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T TRY TO REPEAL IT OR DELAY IT 46 TIMES. YOU DON'T HOLD THE ECONOMY HOSTAGE.
Jon: I'M NOT IN GOVERNMENT BUT I HEARD 47 IS THE CHARM. IT'S AN OLD SAYING I HAVE HEARD. [LAUGHTER]
YOU HAVE TED CRUZ, MARCO RUBIO, MIKE LEE AND RAND PAUL WHO ESSENTIALLY THE MOUNT RUSHMORE OF THE TEA PARTY DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PREVENT PEOPLE LIKE ME. I'M A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. ON JANUARY 1 PEOPLE LIKE ME WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY NEVER AGAIN BE DENIED COVERAGE FOR PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
Jon: THERE'S WONDERFUL THINGS IN THIS HEALTH CARE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOG ON.
PEACE OF MIND.
Jon: YES. FOR THE NEXT GENERATION IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
