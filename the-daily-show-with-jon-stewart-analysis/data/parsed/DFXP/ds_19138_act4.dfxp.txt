[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. JOIN US NEXT WEEK. OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEEN ABOUT 22 MINUTES SINCE THE START OF THE SHOW. LET'S HOPE THAT THE CEASEFIRE WE ANNOUNCED AT THE TOP IS STILL IN EFFECT. FINGERS CROSSED, EVERYBODY. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
IN THE CONDOMINIUMS OF SOUTH FLORIDA, MY CONSTITUENTS SOMETIMES TURN TO YIDDISH TO FIND THE PERFECT WORD. THEY HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE G.O.P. MAJORITY: STOP THIS MISHEGAS AND DO YOUR JOBS.
