Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TWO THINGS. TWO THINGS. TWO THINGS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE AMERICAN ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. ONE IT IS FULL OF THE COUNTRY'S KINDEST AND MOST THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND TWO,
HOLLYWOOD FOR YEARS HAS UNDERESTIMATED HOW MUCH WE WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE BIBLE AND RELIGION.
ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY IS JUST FINE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.
WHY DOESN'T HOLLYWOOD CHURN OUT MORE RELIGIOUS MOVIES.
Jon: THAT'S HOW YOU SHOW RESPECT FOR RELIGION. GET IN THERE AND CHURN SOME (bleep) OUT. HAVE YOU HEARD THE GOOD NEWS BECAUSE THIS WEEK'S TOP ACTION HEROES AT THE BOX OFFICE ARE NOT ONLY CAPTAIN AMERICA BUT ALSO CAPTAIN SUMERIA. IN TWO WEEKS OF RELEASE, THE NOAH MOVIE HAS EARNED NEARLY $200 MILLION WORLDWIDE, SO RELIGIOUS FILM GOERS MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT.
IT IS AWFUL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. WHAT IS THE ISSUE?
THEY CLAIM THAT THE MOVIE IS UNFAITHFUL TO ONE OF BIBLES MOST FAMOUS TALES.
THERE'S DEFINITELY ARTISTIC LIBERTIES TAKEN IN THE FILM. THIS MOVIE IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SO YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT THE MOVIE ABOUT A MAN WHO LIVES TO 950 AND LOADS TWO OF EVERY ANIMAL ONTO A 300 CUBIT LONG BOAT, BY THE WAY A CUBIT IS FROM HERE TO HERE, 300 OF THESE BAD BOYS YEAH THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THE LIONS AWAY FROM THE DELICIOUS ZEBRAS. LISTEN. YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT FILM WON'T QUALIFY TO SUBMIT IN THE DOCUMENTARY CATEGORY. THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS. I GUESS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THIS VERSION IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS IN THE BIBLE. BUT HOW DIFFERENT COULD NOAH BE?
IT DOESN'T USE THE WORD GOD, NOT ONCE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM.
NOT REFERENCE AT ALL TO GOD IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE.
Jon: THAT IS WEIRD BECAUSE IF THERE'S NO GOD IN THE MOVIE WHO IS TELLING HIM TO BUILD THE BOAT? TO GO ALL WATERWORLD WE BOUGHT A ZOO ON EVERYONE?
THE MOVIE DOES USE THE WORD CREATOR IN REFERENCING GOD. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BIBLE USES THE WORD GOD. HIS DOG?
THE MOVIE DOES USE THE WORD CREATOR IN REFERENCING GOD. THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH THAT THE BIBLE USES THE WORD GOD.
Jon: YEAH, I MEAN CREATOR THAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING. AND WHILE THE BIBLE DOESN'T ACTUALLY EVER USE THE WORD GOD BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN ENGLISH. MY GUESS IS WE'RE NOT REALLY UP FOR THAT DISCUSSION. BUT THE QUESTION IS, IS CREATOR ENOUGH? I MEAN CREATOR COULD BE XENU, COULD BE TYLER THE CREATOR, COULD BE THE MASTER BUILDER. IF ONLY SOMEONE IN THE NOAH FILM, IF ONLY SOMEONE IN THIS FILM LIKE NOAH'S SON HAM SAID SOMETHING CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL LIKE QUOTE "MY FATHER SAYS THERE CAN BE NO KING. THE CREATOR IS GOD." THAT WOULD CLARIFY. OH RIGHT THEY DIDN'T SEE THE (bleep) MOVIE. WHAT ELSE DID THEY PUT IN THIS MOVIE THAT ISN'T IN THE BIBLE?
NOAH GETS DRUNK. NOAH HAS SOME VERY DARK MOMENTS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT SOME EARLY TEST AUDIENCES WERE NOT EXCITED ABOUT.
Jon: YOU CAN'T SLANDER NOAH LIKE THAT. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? GENESIS CHAPTER 9, VERSE 21. WHY DON'T YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THIS STUFF? YOU DID READ THE SAME BIBLE AS THE REST OF US, RIGHT?
MY MEMORIES OF THE STORY OF NOAH ARE VERY DIFFERENT. I HAD THIS CHILDREN'S BIBLE WHEN I WAS A KID AND IT ALL THESE ILLUSTRATIONS IN IT. THEY HAD THE TWO ANIMLS WALKING SIDE BY SIDE AND THE SUN COMES OUT AND EVERYBODY LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
Jon: EVERYBODY? NOBODY LIVES! EVERYBODY IS ONE FAMILY AND TWO OF EVERY ANIMAL. EVERYBODY ELSE DROWNED. YOU KNOW HOW MANY KOALA BEARS DROWNED? [AUDIENCE BOOS] TALK TO GOD. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THEY MADE AN OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE MOVIE. THE OLD TESTAMENT HAS STUFF IN IT THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT FILMMAKERS TO TALK ABOUT. JUST STICK TO JESUS AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.
SON OF GOD IS GENERATING A LOT OF HEAT BECAUSE JESUS IS UMM SO SEXY. I'M GAWKING AT THIS ACTOR AND I'M THINKING OH MY GOSH, I'M GAWKING AT JESUS.
IS THIS PROPER?
AND THEN I FELT KIND OF DIRTY AND CREEPY, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DON'T WORRY I'M SURE SEXY JESUS FORGIVES YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
