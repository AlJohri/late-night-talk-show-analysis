FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. YOU KNOW WHO IS ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT? YOU'LL BE DELIGHTED ABOUT THIS. ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THANK YOU. PETER DINKLAGE FROM THE HIT HBO SHOW GIRLS OR GAME OF THRONES OR ONE OF THEM. IT'S ALL NUDITY TO ME. FIRST THERE'S BEEN A VERY BIG DEVELOPMENT IN THE CHRIS CHRISTIE BRIDGE-GATE SCANDAL.
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION COMMISSIONED BY THE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE INTO THE BRIDGE-GATE SCANDAL HAVE BEEN RELEASED TODAY.
Jon: I WONDER WHAT THE RESULTS WILL BE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE HIMSELF COMMISSIONED. [LAUGHTER] PERHAPS I'LL READ ABOUT IT IN THIS SCANDAL'S PAPER OF RECORD THE CHRISTIE SUN-TIMES-PICAYUNE. BUT OBVIOUSLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE REPORT. WHAT DOES IT SAY?
SO THIS REPORT HAS JUST COME OUT. IT EXONERATES YOU COMPLETELY. DO YOU FEEL EXONERATED?
Jon: IT BETTER. IT COST ME $1 MILLION (bleep) DOLLARS AND BY ME I MEAN YOU IF YOU ARE A NEW JERSEY TAXPAYER. ANYWAY. STRONGER THAN THE STORM CHRISTIE 2012. SERIOUSLY GOVERNOR CHRISTIE YOU FEEL EXONERATED?
YEAH, I DO BUT I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THIS IS WHERE IT WOULD END.
Jon: WE KNOW. YOU AIN'T NOSTRADAMUS. YOU KNOW, MEGYN MONTHS AGO I VISITED AN ORACLE WHO KILLED A GOAT, READ THE ENTRAILS AND SAW A VISION THAT MY HAND PICKED LEGAL TEAM WOULD WRITE A REPORT EXONERATING ME FROM ALL WRONGDOING. BY THE WAY IF CHRISTIE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS BRIDGE-GATE WHO IS?
THE INTERNAL REVIEW HEAPED ALL THE BLAME FOR SHUTTING DOWN LANES ON FORMER PORT AUTHORITY OFFICIAL DAVID WILDSTEIN AND CHRISTIE'S FORMER TOP AIDE BRIDGET ANNE KELLY.
THEY SAID QUOTE -- THIS IS ABOUT BRIDGET KELLY -- SHE SEEMED EMOTIONAL. SHE WAS HABITUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS PERCEIVED BY BY THE GOVERNOR. A BOYFRIEND HAD ENDED A RELATIONSHIP, PORTRAYING MS. KELLY AS DUPLICITOUS, WEEPING FREQUENTLY AND DEPENDENT ON MEN FOR APPROVAL STABILITY.
Jon: THAT ALSO EXPLAINS VERY CLEARLY WHY THE OFFICIAL REPORT WAS TITLED BITCHES BE CRAZY, RIGHT? [LAUGHTER] WAIT A MINUTE! HOW DID THAT #GET ON THERE? [LAUGHTER] DAMN YOU, INTERNET! WORKED SO QUICKLY. SO CASE CLOSED. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
CHRIS CHRISTIE GOT HIS MOJO BACK.
MOJO, SWAGGER.
HIS MOJO IS BACK. HE IS BACK.
IT'S THE OLD CHRISTIE. IT'S THE MOJO CHRISTIE.
Jon: CHRISTIE HAS GONE FROM BEING A DESERT OF MOJO TO A VERITABLE MOJO-ASIS. AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS JERSEY REGION MOJO-METER. AS YOU CAN SEE IN DECEMBER CHRISTIE WAS BARELY AT SITS QUIETLY AT A JETS GAME BUT NOW HE IS UP TO WEARS A TRACK SUIT TO A FUNERAL. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. HE HAS HIS GROOVE BACK. DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TOJAMAICA AND FALL IN LOVE WITH TAYE DIGGS. HEY, GIRLFRIEND. SO WITH CHRISTIES'S CAMPAIGN BACK IN GEAR THE GOVERNOR DID WHAT ANYBODY ON A HOT STREAK AND WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE OF ATLANTIC CITY WOULD DO. HE WENT TO LAS VEGAS.
THE REPUBLICANS GOVERNORS ARE HEADING WEST TO LAS VEGAS. THEY ARE SPEAKING AT THE SPRING MEETING AT THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION BUT MORE IMPORTANT THEIR PRIVATE TALKS WITH ONE MAN REPUBLICAN SUPER DONOR SHELDON ADLESON. WHY WOULD CHRISTIE GO TO VEGAS TO IMPRESS A GUY WHOSE JEOPARDY INTRO WOULD BE AN ULTRA ZIONIST WHO MAKES MOST OF HIS MONEY OFF GAMBLING ADDICTS IN MACAU.
SHELDON ADELSON THE GOP SUPER DONOR WHO GAVE MORE THAN $90 MILLION IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP BARACK OBAMA'S REELECTION IN 2012.
IN 2012 THE NEWT GINGRICH CAMPAIGN GOT $15 MILLION FROM ADLESON, MITT ROMNEY GOT $30 MILLION.
Jon: OH, RIGHT HE THROWS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AWAY ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FROM HIS TRICKED OUT SCOOTER. [LAUGHTER] I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REMOJOED GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY TO TAKE HIS FAMOUS STRAIGHT HONEST TALK TO VEGAS TO SPEAK TRUTH TO MONEY.
NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE APOLOGIZING.
Jon: WHAT? CHRISTIE DOESN'T APOLOGIZE. WHAT IS HE APOLOGIZING FOR KICK ADLESON'S ASS? WHAT IS HE ACTUALLY APOLOGIZING FOR?
APOLOGIZING FOR REFERRING TO THE WEST BANK AS OCCUPIED TERITORIES WHILE SPEAKING AT THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION.
Jon: OH, MY GOD HE DID WHAT? BECAUSE ONLY AN ULTRA LEFT WING PEACENIK LOSER WOULD REFER TO THAT AREA OF THE WEST BANK AS THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.
ISRAEL MUST STOP SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.
Jon: GET A JOB, HIPPY. FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR ZIONIST BILLIONAIRE CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE. SAM, THANKS FOR JOINING US. WE'RE GLAD YOU MADE IT. SAM, LET ME ASK YOU -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THIS IS CRAZY.
YEAH.
Jon: IF SHELDON ADLESON DOESN'T APPROVE AS A TERM AS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS OCCUPIED TERRITORIES WHAT DOES HE THINK IS AN ACCEPTABLE TERM FOR THAT AREA?
YOU KNOW, SHELDON'S IS NOT PICKY. HE'S OPEN TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NAMES OUTER ISRAEL, ISRAEL IN WAITING, PALESTINIAN TERROR EMPORIUM.
Jon: THOSE ARE NOT THE MOST OBJECTIVE TERMS. AND OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IS FAIR? IT CLEARLY SUGGESTS TERRITORIES THAT ARE BEING OCCUPIED PERHAPS BY SOME FOREIGN MILITARY OR COUNTLESS FOREIGN SETTLEMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU JUST DESCRIBED THE WEST BANK. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE WEST BANK.
OKAY "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH YASSER ARAFAT. I GOT YOU. I GOT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHEN DID THE GUY WHO MAKES DONALD TRUMP'S HAIR LOOK NATURAL GET VETO POWER OVER EVERY WORD REPUBLICANS SAY ABOUT ISRAEL?
NOT JUST ISRAEL, JON. HE ALSO WANTS UNIONS TO BE CALLED THUG COLLECTIVES, OFFSHORE TAX HAVENS ARE NOW MONEY RESORTS AND HE DOES NOT USE A MOTORIZED SCOOTER HE PRACTICES EXTREME SITTING SO RAD, I KNOW.
Jon: I'LL GIVE YOU THAT THE MAN IS A CHAMPION SITTER. LISTEN. HOW CAN ANYONE CLAIM TO BE A LEADER IF THEY ARE BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO PLEASE AN 80-YEAR-OLD GAMBLING MOGUL.
I'M SORRY HE PREFERS 40-YEAR-OLD JACKPOT FACILITATOR. IF YOU DON'T MIND.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE SUPPOSED MEN OF INTEGRITY ARE SO WILLING TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR FOR MONEY.
OH REALLY, JON. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT TACO BELL ONE OF "THE DAILY SHOW'S" MAJOR SPONSORS? HMMMM.
Jon: I THINK IT'S A TASTE SENSATION THAT THINKS OUTSIDE THE BUN TO PROVIDE AMERICA'S FAMILIES WITH A WHOLESOME AND NUTRITIOUS DINING EXPERIENCE. [  APPLAUSE  ] TACO BELL -- LIVE MAS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH. YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT AND THAT IS WHY I SENT SOME OVER FOR YOU.
Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DID THAT. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT AT ALL. WHAT?
OH, YEAH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU OH ROMAN CENTURION.
YUM.
Jon: MMMMM. [LAUGHTER] I'M DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO POOP ALL NIGHT.
YES, EAT UP! WHORE.
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
