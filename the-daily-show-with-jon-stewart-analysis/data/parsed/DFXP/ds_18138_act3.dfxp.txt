WELCOME BANG. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THAT YOU KNOW  FROM THE HUNGER GAMES HE WILL  ALSO BE IN A UPCOMING MOVIE IN THAT SERIES. HIS LATEST MOVIE IS IS CALLED  "PARANOIA."
WHY DO YOU KEEP PACING SO  MUCH? YOU LOOK NERVOUS.
WHERE ARE YOU? LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW  THIS IS GOING TO WORK.
WE HIT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS  FIRST.
OR MAYBE THE GIRL. IF YOU EVEN TOUCH HER... THEN GET US WHAT WE NEED. John: PLEASE WELCOME LIAM  HEMSWORTH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: LET'S SIT DOWN  TOGETHER. LIKE A DOG BEFORE THEY SIT. SO MANY PEOPLE WHO COME ON THIS  SHOW SAYING THESE CHAIRS ARE  LIKE DOGS.
YOU HAVE TO DO A COUPLE OF  360s BEFORE YOU FIGURE IT OUT
John: IS THAT HOW YOU MAKE A  DOG SIT? JUST SPIN AROUND A FEW TIMES.
THAT'S WHAT MY DOG DOES. HE DOES 360s LIKE THIS. WE WENT THERE.
John: LOVELY TO MEET YOU,  LIAM.
YEAH. John: WHAT IS IT LIKE HEARING  THAT SOUND FROM WOMEN AND MEN  AND KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT  SARCASTIC?
IT'S VERY FLATTERING. IT'S NICE. AND THEN I COMPLETELY LET  EVERYONE DOWN BY DOING 360s ON  MY CHAIR.
John: DO THE 360 DOG BIT. THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE A  CONVERSATION FROM THERE. WE'LL PIN THE CONVERSATION  AROUND THE 60 DOG JOKE. PARANOIA IS THE MOVIE ABOUT  CORPORATE ESPIONAGE. SEEMS LIKE THERE'S LOADS MORE  ACTION MOVIES AND THRILLERS  AROUND WHITE COLLAR CRIME. DO YOU THINK WE'VE ACCEPTED THAT  IS WHERE THE REAL MONEY IS NOW? JEWELRY HIVES SEEM LIKE A THING  OF THE PAST. IT'S WHITE COLLAR CRIME.
VERY SNEAKY THESE DAYS. THAT'S WHAT WAS VERY INTERESTING  TO ME IS THE WHOLE WORLD OF  CORPORATE ESPIONAGE. I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY IN MOVIES  BEFORE I READ THIS SCRIPT. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY  REAL. THEN I REALIZED THAT HUGE CAR  COMPANIES ARE LOSING BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS TO CORPORATE ESPIONAGE. AND A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES
John: WHAT ELSE I LIKED ABOUT  THIS MOVIE IS THE GOOD,  OLD-FASHIONED BRITISH VILLAIN. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. WE LOST THAT ROLE. WE HAD THE BP OIL SPILL. I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT GIVE ALAN  RICKMAN A FEW CALLS.
HE'S A SCARY LITTLE MAN, GARY  IS.
John: I GUESS BECAUSE IT'S A  BIG AMOUNT OF SCARINESS FOR A  TINY BRITISH MAN.
IT IS. IT'S SO MUCH SCARINESS TO COME  OUT OF JUST A LITTLE GUY.
John: IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT  HE'S LITTLE. IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU'RE A LARGE  AUSTRALIAN MAN. WE'RE ALL LITTLE TO YOU. I WAS IN AUSTRALIA EARLIER THIS  YEAR. IT IS A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY.
THANK YOU. John: YOU'RE WELCOME.   ( APPLAUSE )
John: YOU'RE FROM MELBOURNE. I'M FROM, YEAH, I GREW UP A  COUPLE HOURS OUTSIDE OF  MELBOURNE ON A LITTLE ISLAND
John: WE WENT TO SYDNEY. IT WAS REALLY GREAT. REALLY LOVED IT. PEOPLE ALL AROUND WERE SAYING IF  YOU LIKE IT HERE, YOU SHOULD GO  TO MELBOURNE. IT'S REALLY LAID BACK THERE. MORE LAID BACK THAN THIS? ARE THEY PERMANENTLY  TRANQUILIZED?
I THINK 99% OF IT IS THAT  THEY'RE DRUNK MOST OF THE TIME. EVERYTHING IS JUST FUN
John: THAT IS TRUE. THE LEGAL DRINKING AGE IS  8-AND-A-HALF, ISN'T IT?
YEAH, I WAS BORN INTO A PUB. John: WE ALSO WENT TO SEE AN  AUSSIE RULES GAME FOR THE FIRST  TIME. HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED THAT?
I GREW UP PLAYING THAT. MY DAD ACTUALLY, HE PLAYED  AUSSIE RULES, YOU KNOW, HIS  WHOLE UPBRINGING. ONE OF HIS FIRST EXPERIENCES,  MEETING MUM'S PARENTS, WAS THEY  CAME AND WATCHED HIM PLAY A FOOTBALL GAME. AT THE TIME HE HAD A LARGE BEARD  AND A PONY TAIL. HE WAS IN A BIKER GANG AT THE  TIME. AND HE WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT YOUR  PARENTS-IN-LAW WOULD WANT. AND IT WAS ABOUT FIVE MINUTES  INTO THE GAME. ANOTHER PLAYER CAME UP. AND GRABBED MY DAD BY THE PONY  TAIL. AND NOT WHAT YOU DO TO SOMEONE  WITH A PONY TAIL, ESPECIALLY MY  DAD. AND HE TURNED AROUND AND KNOCKED  HIM OUT. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT MY  PARENTS HAD MET MY DAD. HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY. HE'S WORKED FOR CHILD  PROTECTION. HE'S NOT AN AGGRESSIVE PERSON.
John: WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? I WASN'T A CHILD. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE OUT MY  DAD... HE'S IN A BIKER GANG. IT WASN'T LIKE HELL'S ANGELS OR  SOMETHING.
John: YOUR DAD IS A  CHILD-PUNCHING PSYCHOPATH. THAT IS WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO  POINT OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING  HERE. "PARANOIA" WILL BE IN THEATERS  ON AUGUST 16. LIAM HEMSWORTH, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
