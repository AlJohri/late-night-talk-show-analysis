FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT'S GUEST -- WE HAVE A GOOD ONE UNIVISION AND FUSION ANCHOR JORGE RAMOS IS JOINING US. FIRST IF IT TOOK  YOU A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET YOUR SAUSAGE McMUFFIN THIS MORNING IT WASN'T BECAUSE THIS YEAR'S SAUSAGE CROP HAS SUFFERED A  PARTICULARLY POOR CONGEAL.
STAGING A WALKOUT SAYING IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SURVIVE ON $7.25 AN HOUR.
Jon: THE WAGES ARE SO LOW SOME FAST FOOD WORKERS HAVE HAD TO RESORT A LIFE OF CRIME. [ LAUGHTER ] OR WORSE PROSTITUTION. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HAVE A PRETTY MOUTH THERE GRIMACE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THE QUESTION IS:  RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE FROM THE VERY DIFFICULT TO LIVE ON $7.25 AN HOUR TO SOMETHING MORE LIVABLE. IT SEEMS REASONABLE FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT IS THAT PROFITABLE. SO LET'S HEAR WHY IT WILL DESTROY THE VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
LET'S GIVE PEOPLE MORE PURCHASING POWER.
THAT'S THE KEYNSIAN VIEW.
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE. HOW IS THAT GOVERNMENT -- YES I'M SICK OF THESE WELFARE QUEENS SUCKELLING AT THE TEET OF THE EMPLOYER THEY WORK FOR. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT KICKING IN THE EXTRA MONEY BUT PAINTING A RAISE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE AS AKIN TO WELFARE PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE NEXT ARGUMENT WELL, THESE JOBS ARE SUPPOSED TO SUCK.
I'M A BIG FAN OF EMPOWERMENT OVER ENTITLEMENT. THESE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE LIFE LONG JOBS. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR AND GET SKILLS.
IT'S LIKE A STARTER GIG.. A FRIER'S APPRENTICESHIP, IF WILL YOU. A GRILL SQUIRE. NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING. JON, THESE ARGUMENTS AGAINST RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE ARE ENTERTAININGLY (bleep) BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED MORE OF THEM. IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD SUPERSIZE THEM? [LAUGHTER] WITH A SIDE OF SLIPPERY SLOPE.
WHAT SHOULD THE MINIMUM WAGE BE.
$15, $20.
WHY NOT $50.
WHY NOT RAISE IT AT $45 AN HOUR.
WHY STOP AT $15. WHY NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $100,000.
Jon: AND THEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] -- AND THEN -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE COULD ALL LIVE LIKE KINGS. [ LAUGHTER ] BURGER KINGS! [LAUGHTER] [  APPLAUSE  ] BUT LET'S -- LET'S FOR A MOMENT ENGAGE HER ARGUMENT SEEING AS SHE IS MAKING THIS ARGUMENT ON A FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK. THE REASON YOU DON'T RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $100,000 AN HOUR IS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE ECONOMICALLY FOR SOMEONE WORKING THE DRIVE-THROUGH TO MAKE $4 MILLION A WEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE MIGHT BE A REASONABLE PLACE IN BETWEEN THE $290 A WEEK THEY MAKE NOW AND THE $4 MILLION A WEEK YOU SUGGEST. [ LAUGHTER ] PERHAPS WE CAN COME TO A NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE. SO WE'VE ENGAGED IN SOME ABSURD ARGUMENTS. CAN I GET AN ARGUMENT AGAINST RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT ONE THAT IS DEEP FRIED IN CONTEMPT, SEASONED WITH DISDAIN?
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US THE EMOTIONAL SIDE OF STORY, PEOPLE LIVE $15 TO LIVE ON, THEY ARE STARVING WITHOUT IT. I GOT THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DUDE, ARE YOU SERIOUS? [LAUGHTER] THAT IS THE TYPE OF STATEMENT THAT IS USUALLY FOLLOWED BY A VISIT FROM A DEAD BUSINESS PARTNER AND THE GHOSTS OF CHRISTMAS PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WE'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU NEED IT TO FEED YOUR FAMILY. FINE. I'VE GOT THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S HEAR THE ARGUMENT TREATING IT AS THOUGH YOU ARE NOT HUMAN. MR. VARNEY WOULD LIKE TO STRIP THE EMOTION AWAY FROM ALL THIS UNTIL HE DOESN'T.
DO YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE FRESH OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T GET A DIPLOMA THAT DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY BASIC SKILLS DO YOU THINK THEY DESERVE $15. I'M ASKING TO MAKE A MORAL JUDGMENT HERE.
Jon: OH, I'M MAKING ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I THINK EVERYBODY WHO JUST HEARD YOU SAY THAT IS MAKING A MORAL JUDGMENT RIGHT NOW. YOU MIGHT WANT TO REINFORCE YOUR CHRISTMAS STOCKING THIS YEAR BECAUSE YOU GETTING COAL. BUT I GET YOU ARE A SUPPLY SIDER YOU WANT TO HEAR A MORAL ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT TYPE OF ECONOMICS. LET'S LOOK TO A GENTLEMAN SEEN AS A VOICE OF MORAL AUTHORITY FOR MANY PEOPLE.
TODAY POPE FRANCIS DENOUNCED TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS AS UNFAIR TO THE POOR.
HE URGES WORLD LEADERS TO FIGHT POVERTY AND INEQUALITY.
MONEY MUST SERVE AND NOT RULE. I URGE YOU TO RETURN THE ECONOMICS IN FINANCE TO AN ETHICAL APPROACH THAT FAVORS HUMAN BEINGS.
Jon: SOMEBODY LIGHT SOME INCENSE THAT IS GOING TO GO OVER LIKE A FART IN CHURCH.
I DISAGREE WITH THE POPE WHO DOESN'T LIKE FREE MARKET CAPITALISM. I THINK IT'S A GREAT LIBERATOR.
Jon: YOU ARE GOING UP AGAINST THE POPE? YOU ARE GOING UP AGAINST THE POPE ON HOW TO HELP THE POOR? HELPING THE POOR IS IN THIS MAN'S WHEELHOUSE. THIS POPE HELPS THE POOR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU ARE TELLING HIM HOW TO DO HIS JOB? POPE DOESN'T COME OVER TO WHERE YOU WORK AND SLAP JAMIE DIMON'S (bleep) OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WEIRD THAT WASN'T IN THE PROMPTER. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN ANYONE ACTUALLY HAVE A REBUTTAL FOR THE POPE?
WITH ALL DUE HUMILITY AND AS A CHURCH-GOING CATHOLIC CONVERT, DEVOTIONAL CONVERT, I ADORE THE HOLY FATHER, I STILL MUST COMPLETELY DISAGREE. NEED I REMIND HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS CHARITY IS A GOSPEL VALUE. THAT PUTS FREE MARKET CAPITALISM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF LORD.
Jon: EXACTLY. WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T SERVE BOTH GOD AND MONEY? WHO WOULD SAY SUCH A THING? WHO WOULD -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- SAY SUCH A -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S NOT FAIR. LOOK AT THE BEARD. THE GUY IS CLEARLY A MARXIST. [ LAUGHTER ] STEP RIGHT UP. WHO HAS NEXT?
THE POPE CRITICIZES AN ENTIRE ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND IS NEGATIVE ABOUT IT HE IS INDULGING IN POLITICS AND I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD.
I PERSONALLY DO NOT WANT MY SPIRITUAL LIFE MIXED UP WITH MY POLITICAL LIFE. I GO TO CHURCH TO SAVE MY SOUL. [ LAUGHTER ] [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: THEN WHY AREN'T YOU THERE RIGHT NOW? [LAUGHTER] I DO THINK WE'VE GOT SOME COMMON GROUND HERE. THINK WE BOTH ACTUALLY AGREE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID TOO MUCH MONEY TO SHOVEL UNAPPETIZING, UNHEALTHY (bleep) TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. WE JUST DISAGREE ABOUT WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE AND WHERE THEY WORK.
