FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] â™ª
JON: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE HAVE PREPARED A PROGRAM MY GUEST TONIGHT, EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST AND ACTIVIST GIGI IBRAHIM WILL BE HERE. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SITUATION IN EGYPT. AS YOU KNOW, THEY RECENTLY HAD AN ELECTION THERE WHERE EGYPTIANS TOOK TO THE POLLS TO USHER IN A NEW ERA OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL CHANGE. THEY SWEPT OUT THE MILITARY COUP COMMANDANT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI THEY SWEPT OUT THE MILITARY COUP COMMANDANT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI AND REPLACED HIM WITH DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI. WELL, THAT'S WEIRD. THE STRONG MAN THEY'RE THROWING OUT OF OFFICE HAS THE SAME NAME AND FACE AS THE NEW PRESIDENT. PERHAPS THAT WILL BE MY FIRST QUESTION TO GIGI. OF COURSE, EGYPT RIGHT NOW IS JUST A NUBILE, YOUNG DEMOCRACY MERELY TOYING WITH THE LEVERS OF SELF DETERMINATION TO ENJOY THE SOPHISTICATED AND MATURE BOUQUET OF REPRESENTATION YOU MUST TURN TO THESE UNITED STATES WHERE, FOR INSTANCE IN LAST NIGHT'S IOWA REPUBLICAN SENATE RACE OUR HIGH MINDED RHETORIC WAS SECOND TO NONE.
I'M JONI ERNST. I GREW UP CASTRATING HOGS ON AN IOWA FARM.
JON: AS OUR FOUNDING FATHERS INTEDED IT TO BE. BY THE WAY, SHE WON THE PRIMARY. I BELIEVE THE LOSERS OPENING STATEMENT WAS I USE TO FART INTO MY HAND AND THEN SMELL IT. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ALRIGHT. MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE AS A MATURE DEMOCRACY AS WE WOULD LIKE. DOES ANYONE OUT THERE GOT A DEMOCRACY THAT'S REALLY, TRULY BLOOMING?
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 50 YEARS SYRIANS HAVE A CHOICE AMONG CANDIDATES IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TODAY.
JON: NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. SYRIA. YES, AS IT TURNS OUT THE EPICENTER OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S HARSHEST AND BLOODIEST CIVIL WARS IS NOW A MUST VISIT FOR DEMOCRACY CONNOISSEURS. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014: LITERAL DEMOCALPYSE EDITION. SO, WHAT ARE THE HALLMARKS OF SYRIAN DEMOCRACY?
VOTING IS RESTRICTED TO AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
JON: SAME HERE: SCHOOLS, GYMNASIUMS AND SUCH.
THE SYMBOLIC WAY TO DECLARE ALLEGIANCE IS TO CAST THEIR BALLOT IN BLOOD.
JON: THAT'S DIFFERENT. ALTHOUGH DO SYRIANS GET AN I VOTED STICKER? SO, I GUESS YOU GET TEN ELECTIONS IN SYRIA AND YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE VOTING. WHAT TYPE OF CAMPAIGN SIGNAGE MAY REPRESENT THE SYRIAN ELECTION SEASON.
PERHAPS THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ELECTION POSTER IN THE WORLD. BASHAR AL-ASSAD ON A BURNT OUT BUILDING IN THE BATTLE SCARRED TOWN OF HOMS.
JON: OK, THAT SEEMS TONE DEAF. BUT MAKES SENSE IF YOU KNOW ASSAD'S SLOGAN. I'M SOMEWHAT HESITANT TO COMPARE WITH MY PARALLEL DEMOCRACY STUDY. OUT OF CURIOSITY, THE INCUMBENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD, WHAT'S HIS STANCE ON I DON'T KNOW, GREEN HOUSE GASES?
THE REGIME HAS HUNDREDS OF TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND LARGE STOCK PILES OF SARIN.
ATTACKING HIS OWN PEOPLE WITH CHLORINE GAS.
JON: OKAY. I WILL PUT YOU DOWN AS REGULATION AVERSE. LOOK, I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT A CAMPAIGN ADVISOR OR POLITICAL STRATEGIST IN ANY WAY, BUT I THINK THIS CANDIDATE AL-ASSAD IS VULNERABLE ON A NUMBER OF SPOT HERE. WHAT DOES HIS OPPONENT HASSAN AL NOURI HAVE TO SAY? BECAUSE UNLESS THIS GUY'S A TOTAL TOOL, I THINK HE'S GOING TO CRUSH AL-ASSAD.
HASSAN AL NOURI CALLED AL-ASSAD A VERY STRONG LEADER AND HE SAID QUOTE YOU HAVE TO RESPECT WHAT ASSAD IS DOING.
POLITICALLY I THINK HE IS DOING WHAT HE HAS TO DO, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE CRISIS.
I DO AGREE WITH PRESIDENT ASSAD IN MANY ISSUES.
I'M NOT ANTI-ASSAD. AND NO ONE IS PERFECT.
JON: IN FACT I AM VOTING FOR HIM. FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED BY OUR NEW CORRESPONDENT IN SYRIA MICHAEL CHE. MICHAEL CHE, THANK FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: THIS IS SO EXCITING. I MEAN, IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY AT THE SHOW. THIS IS GREAT. YOUR FIRST DAY AT THE SHOW. AND YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT IS TO GO TO SYRIA. THAT'S [BEEP]. HOW'S IT GOING?
JON, STANDING HERE IN THE RUINS OF THE ONCE PROUD CITY OF ALEPPO MAKES IT PAINFULLY CLEAR THE FUTURE OF SYRIA WON'T BE DECIDED AT THE BALLOT BOX. THE ONLY QUESTION THE SYRIAN PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS IF THEIR TOWNS WILL BE OVER RUN BY ASSAD'S MURDEROUS FORCES OR BY REBEL MILITANTS, WHETHER THEY BE AL-NUSRA OR THE ISLAMIC FRONT. THEREIN LIES THE BITTER IRONY OF THIS SO CALLED FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. IT'S GUNS AND SHELLS THAT HOLD THE REAL POWER HERE. FROM ALEPPO, I'M MICHAEL CHE. [LAUGHING]
YOU LIKE THAT, JON? FIRST DAY.
JON: YA, I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOOD.
NAILED IT BOOM. I MURDERED THAT [BEEP], KILLED IT, I KILLED IT!
JON: AMAZING. MICHAEL, I HAVE TO TELL YOU I HAVE BEEN HERE 15 YEARS. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE FINALLY HAVE A CORRESPONDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYRIAN CONFLICT --
EXCUSE ME, JON. WHAT THE [BEEP] IS GOING ON HERE? THANK YOU, I WILL TAKE IT FROM HERE, WHOEVER YOU ARE.
JON: THAT'S AASIF MANDVI. AASIF MANDVI WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN SYRIA?
WELL, I AM PROTECTING WHAT IS MINE. OKAY! I DO THE MUSLIM STORIES. THAT IS MY BEAT. THANK YOU.
JON: YOU HAVE THAT NEW SHOW ON HBO. YOU CAN'T DO TWO SHOWS AT ONCE.
OH YES, I CAN. BECAUSE IF THAT ONE,  ITHE GOOD ONE GETS CANCELED I CAN COME CRAWLING BACK TO YOU. SO IF I MAY.
JON: ALRIGHT, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
BASHAR AL-ASSAD MORE LIKE BASHAR AL-SUCKS. AM I RIGHT? BOOM!
NO, NO, NO IT'S AL-ASSAD. IT'S ARABIC FOR LION.
ALRIGHT, YOU SHUT UP, ALRIGHT?
JON: HOLY [BEEP] YOU SPEAK ARABIC? DO YOU SPEAK ARABIC, MICHAEL?
I'M SURE NOT AS WELL AS YOU AND AASIF.
JON: YA.
ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT FINE. THE NEW GUY'S NOT ONLY STEPPING ON MY TURF, HE'S MAKING US ALL LOOK BAD, JON.
JON: AASIF, GIVE HIM A CHANCE. GIVE HIM SOME RESPECT. ALTHOUGH MICHAEL, SERIOUSLY THOUGH, TRY NOT TO MAKE US LOOK THIS BAD.
SO, YOU DON'T WANT ACTUAL REPORTING? YOU JUST WANT DUMB PUNS LIKE PRESIDENT FARTAR AL-ASSHOLE.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S NICE.
FARTAR, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT? WOW. THIS GUY IS GOOD. HE'S REALLY GOOD.
REALLY GOOD.
YOU LIKE THAT ONE.
YA.
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE? SYRIA MORE LIKE DIARRHEA-RIA BECAUSE THE FOOD IS BAD.
JON: PACE YOURSEL THERE, FRIEND.
JUST PACE YOURSELF.
AASIF MANDVI AND MICHAEL CHE EVERYBODY. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK, EVERYBODY.
