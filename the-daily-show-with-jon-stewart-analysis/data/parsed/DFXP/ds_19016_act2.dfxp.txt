Stewart: WE ARE BACK. SO AS WE HAVE BEEN HEARING, PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTHCARE PLAN ROLLOUT IS CALLED THE WORST ROLLOUT SINCE CRYSTAL METH PEPSI AND MADE THE PRESIDENT SOME FIERCE ADVERSARIES.
IF YOU LOST JON STEWART YOU ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE.
IF YOU LOST JON STEWART YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.
EVEN JON STEWART TAKING SHOTS AT OBAMACARE, WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE ON THE WHOLE PUBLIC DIALOGUE?
Stewart: WHAT IMPACT DOES ME HAVE ON THE PUBLIC DIALOGUE?  WELL, IT INTRODUCES TO THE HEALTHCARE DEBATE THE TERM (BLEEP) PUNT. I DON'T THINK IT HAS BEEN USED PRIOR. AND IT IS NOW, ACCORDING TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT COVERED. BUT I GUESS IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT EVEN JON STEWART, EVEN JON STEWART HAS TURNED AGAINST IT. I CAN'T RECALL EVEN JON STEWART EVER DOING THAT BEFORE.
"THE DAILY SHOW" HOST JON STEWART JOKED THAT THE WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS HAVE BEEN READING THEIR E-MAILS. IF HE LOST JON STEWART, I AM JUST SAYING --
EVEN JON STEWART HAS BEEN HAMMERING AT THIS.
EVEN JON STEWART WAS TURNING ON THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE LEARNS EVERYTHING FROM THE NEWS.
EVEN JON STEWART POKED FUN AT PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE POOR DEBATE PERFORMANCE.
EVEN THE COMICS LAMPOONED THE PRESIDENT'S VARIOUS STATEMENTS ABOUT A PUBLIC PLAN.
I WAS WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN ON "THE DAILY SHOW" WHEN BARACK OBAMA WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND DEMOCRATIC SENATE AND I HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT HE IS GOING AFTER HIM.
Stewart: WHO IS THAT YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPER MOCKING THE PRESIDENT?
LOOK MAKING FUN OF SOMETHING IS NOTHING NEW FOR US. SO DON'T ACT LIKE US MAKING JOKES ABOUT A CERTAIN PROGRAM OR PRESIDENT IS EVIDENCE THAT POLITICIAN OR ISSUE HAS REACHED SOME KIND OF TIPPING POINT FOR ACTION. ALTHOUGH THAT APPARENTLY IS EXACTLY THE CASE THAT THEY ARE MAKING.
SHOULD SEBELIUS STEP DOWN OR BE FIRED.
I CALLED FOR HER RESIGNATION, I THINK WHEN JON STEWART AND SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE ARE MAKING FUN OF THE JOB THAT YOU ARE DOING AND THE WEB SITE, WHAT THAT SPEAKS TO IS THE FACT THAT YOUNG AMERICANS ARE LAUGHING AT THE SECRETARY AND THE WEB SITE.
Stewart: IF THAT CAUSES THINGS TO END WHY WAS THE NETWORK YOU WERE ON STILL ON THE AIR? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: THE SENATOR FROM WYOMING BELIEVES THAT WHEN YOUNG AMERICANS LAUGH AT A FEDERAL OFFICIAL IT IS TIME FOR THAT FEDERAL OFFICIAL TO STEP DOWN. YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT TO THIS GUY, DID YOU?
HOW DID HE SURVIVE OUR VICIOUS POKING OF FUN. AND I SEEM TO REMEMBER THERE WAS ANOTHER FELLOW WITH THAT PRESIDENT. DICK CHENEY SHOT A GUY IN THE FACE TODAY.
Stewart: TWO GLORIOUS DAYS OF CHENEY SHOT AN OLD MAN IN THE FACE JOKES, DID HE LEAVE?  NO!  WE DO A RUNNING SEGMENT CALLED YOU DON'T KNOW DICK, DID HE LEAVE?  WHAT DID IT ACCOMPLISH?  DICK. IT IS AN ARMS RACE.
Stewart: STILL ON TELEVISION. ARBY'S.
ARBY'S. STILL MAKING SANDWICHES. FILLED WITH, FILLED WITH SLICED SOMETHING.
Stewart: WHAT?  WHAT WAS -- WHAT WAS THAT?  WHAT?  WHAT IS THAT BEAUTIFUL SOUND COMING FROM?  IT CAN'T BE, IT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE!
OUR FRIENDS, ARE OUR FRIENDS BACK?  OH, MY GOD, PEOPLE!
THEY ARE BACK!  OH!  PEOPLE, I AM HERE TO SAY. THAT THE JOKES WE DO ON THIS PROGRAM SEEM TO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED VERY LITTLE.
THEY DON'T DO (BLEEP).
Stewart: THEY DO PROVIDE  PERHAPS A LITTLE CATHARSIS OR PERSPECTIVE.
ON A GOOD DAY.
Stewart: MAYBE ON A GOOD DAY, BUT MOST OF THE STUFF WE  COMPLAIN ABOUT NEVER CHANGES. AND TALKING ABOUT -- â™ª EARLY ONSET OSTEOPEROSIS.
Stewart: I HAVE FINE BONE DENSITY. THE POINT IS, DON'T USE OUR JOKES AS EVIDENCE THAT THE THING YOU HATE MUST BE STOPPED. BECAUSE I AM SURE WHEN WE JOKE ABOUT (BLEEP) YOU LIKE, YOU WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO IGNORE IT. WE ADD INSULT, NOT INJURY.
YOU ARE JUST WEAK. DULLING THE POPULIST ANGER THAT COULD REALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM.
Stewart: SOMEBODY HAS BEEN READING SALON.COM.
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING.
Stewart: WHAT'S THAT?
THAT THING WE ALWAYS SAY.
Stewart: OH, I FORGOT ABOUT IT. ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, THREE. (BLEEP)!
Stewart: (BLEEP)!  (BLEEP)!  (BLEEP)!  (BLEEP)!
