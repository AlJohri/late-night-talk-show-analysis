THAT'S OUR SHOW. HEY, BEFORE WE GO, THOUGH. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY, IT IS A STORY ABOUT, IT'S KIND OF A FABLE, REALLY, ABOUT THIS PUNK KID FROM LONG ISLAND. LET ME SEE IF I HAVE GOT ANY FOOTAGE OF HIM. THERE HE IS, RIGHT THERE LOOKS LIKE KIND OF A PUNKIE KID CARRYING A TOILET IN NEW YORK CITY. OH, GEE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS KID IS DOING. JUST-- JUST TERRIBLE. AND THE WHOLE THING IS JUST TERRIBLE. ANYWAY THAT KID'S NAME IS RORY ALBANESE. AND I GOT TO THE SHOW IN 1999 HE STARTED PROBABLY ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT. AND HE WAS A WISE ASS. AND I REALLY LIKED HIM. AND I NOTICED THAT WHATEVER JOB WE GAVE HIM, HE KICKED  THAT JOB'S ASS. LIKE DID IT GREAT, WAS REALLY SMART, REALLY FUNNY. AND JUST KEPT WORKING. SO WE KEPT GIVING HIM MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND MORE CREATIVE CONTROL. AND MORE THINGS TO DO. AND EVERY TIME WE DID IT HE WOULD KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK. SO NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW, 2032, WHATEVER, 2013. SO THIS KID WHO STARTED AT THIS SHOW IN 1999 AS A PA SITTING WITH HIS NAKED ASS ON A TOILET IN TIME'S SQUARE HAS BEEN OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. A TREMENDOUS STORY. AND HAS GONE FROM THAT ANONYMOUS BEGINNING ALL THE WAY TO THIS.
