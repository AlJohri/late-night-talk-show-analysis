FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS ITS DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELL DOM-- WELCOME  TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME  IS JON STEWART. OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR  YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE HEAD  OF THE GROUP THE MISSION  CONTINUES. A GREAT ORGANIZATION THAT  WORKS WITH VETERANS, ERIC  GREITENS WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. AND NO, NO, I'M NOT SICK. HOW YOU KNOW YOU ARE AGING,  AND WEAKENING WHEN YOU COME  OUT, WHEN YOU COME OUT TO THE AUDIENCE AND THEY ALL GO,  AH. SPEAKING OF VETERANS, AS WE  KNOW VETERANS MUST NOW WAIT  THROUGH A BACKLOG OF NEARLY A MILLION BENEFIT CLAIMS AT  THE VA, CLAIMS SEEN HERE  DOING THEIR IMPRESSION OF  YOUR GRANDFATHER'S GARAGE. DON'T MOVE MY BOXES, I HAVE  A SYSTEM! (LAUGHTER)  WELL, TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN A  PROGRESS REPORT IS YOU MAY  RECALL AS OF A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THINGS LOOKED  PRETTY GRIM FOR VETERANS  AWAITSING BENEFIT, FOR NOW  WE GO TO OUR CORRESPONDENT BRIAN WILLIAMS.
AFTER TWO WARS IN WHICH  THEY WERE ASKED TO SACRIFICE  SO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY, MANY VETERANS ARE NOW  RETURNING HOME TO WAIT YEARS  FOR THE BENEFITS THEY WERE  PROMISED. ALMOST A MILLION AMERICAN  VETERANS ARE WAITING FOR  CLAIMS.
Jon: THANKS, BRIAN. SEE YOU SOON. WELL-- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE  TO PAY HIM FOR THAT, DO WE? WELL, FOLKS, GOOD NEWS. THE VETERAN'S AFFAIRS  DEPARTMENT IS NOW  WITHHOLDING BONUSES FOR  SENIOR OFFICIALS OVERSEEING DISABILITY CLAIMS.
Jon: THEY HAVEN'T DONE  REALLY MUCH ABOUT THE  BACKLOG OF CLAIMS BUT THEY HAVE STOPPED GIVING BONUSES  TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED  IT. SO THAT'S SOMETHING. I MEANS THAT'S GOT TO SUCK  THOUGH, FOR THOSE GUYS NOT  GET THEIR BONUSES. I MEAN TO HAVE THE  GOVERNMENT PROMISE YOU A  BENEFIT AND YOU KNOW, NOT  DELIVER IT, WELL-- I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE ELSE EVEN  KNOWS WHAT THAT MUST FEEL  LIKE. TO BE FAIR, THE VA IS NOT  JUST WITHHOLDING BONUSES,  THEY'RE ALSO TAKING STEPS TO FIX THINGS. EVENTUALLY.
WE ARE REVOLVED TO  ELIMINATE THE CLAIMS BACKLOG  OF 2015, NOT JUST REDUCE IT, END IT. WHEN CLAIMS WILL BE  PROCESSED AT 125 DAYS OR  LESS.
Jon: THERE YOU HAVE IT,  IN ONLY TWO MORE YEARS,  THEY'RE HOPING TO HAVE YOU WAIT ONLY FOUR MORE MONTHS. HOW WILL THEY DO IT? WELL, THEY HAVEN'T FULLY  COMPUTERIZED THEIR RECORDS  BUT THEY HAVE COMPUTERIZED  THEIR PLAN TO COMPUTERIZE THEIR RECORD IN THE FORM OF  THIS POWER POINT  PRESENTATION ABOUT THE  BACKLOG OF CLAIMS, INCLUDING THIS SOMEWHAT ALARMING SLIDE  READING THE ENEMY IS PAPER. SEE, THAT'S WHAT IS  HAPPENING? DON'T YOU PEOPLE GET IT? (APPLAUSE)
Jon: DON'T YOU SEE WHAT  THE PROBLEM IS? PAPER HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS  AN ENEMY COMBATANT. (LAUGHTER)  THEREFORE THESE RECORDS CAN  NOW BE HELD FOR INDEFINITE  PERIODS IN A KIND OF BUREAUCRATIC BLACK SITE  LIMBO. A KIND OF PAPER GITMO. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH BY THE WAY IS THE  LEAST POPULAR PAPER DOLL  BOOK EVER. (LAUGHTER)  AT THIS POINT-- YES, YOU CAN  GET THAT AT YOUR CHILDREN'S  STORE. AT THIS POINT IT'S BEGINNING  TO SEEM LIKE NO ONE, NO ONE  CAN SHAKE BENEFITS LOOSE FROM THE VA. OR CAN THEY? OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE WENT  THERE.
900,000 VETERANS HAVE  BEEN STUCK ON ENDLESS CALLS  TO THE VA FIGHTING FOR THEIR  RIGHTS. IF I WAS GOING TO HELP, I'D  FEED TO ENGAGE IN THE  GREATEST PAPER HUNT OF ALL  TIME. IT ALL BEGAN WITH THE STORY  OF IRAQ ARMY VETERAN EUGENE  MAYONNAISE. OH MY GOD, OH NO WHAT IS  HAPPENING?
WHY IS THERE ALL THIS  GLASSWARE EVERYWHERE?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU  DOING? >>.
MANNING, IS THAT YOU? I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.
WELL, I WAS IN IRAQ IN  200 -- I WAS HIT BY AN EID. I PUT IN VA MEDICAL CLAIMS  FOUR TIMES AND THEY HAVE  LOST THEM THREE OUT OF FOUR  TIMES.
YOUR MOST RECENT RONE  CLAIM HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN  IN PROGRESS.
ABOUT 330 DAYS.
SHE TOLD MY WIFE THAT THE  VA FORMS ARE IN A PILE, A  PHYSICAL PILE.
SO WHILE SOME COMPANIES  USE COMPUTERS, THE VA USE  PILE-BASED TECHNOLOGY.
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
I'M GOING TO HELP YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
I'M THE [BLEEP] THAT IS  GOING TO FIND YOUR CLAIM.
YOU CAN DO THAT.
YES, I'M TRAINED  SMOLDERER, I'M DOING DRAMA.
I ALREADY TWO YEARS AGO.
HOW MANY TIMES-- WANTS  DOW MEAN --.
YOU DON'T USE COMPUTERS  OVER THERE.
MANNING'S CLAIM EXISTED  ONLY ON PAPER, PEAKING IT  IMMUNE TO OUR ADVANCED HACKING TECHNOLOGY.
THERE IS NOTHING.
WHY DO I EVEN HAVE A TECH  NERD. GET OUT OF MY WAY. OH, OH. [BLEEP], OH.
THE CLAIM WAS LAST SEEN  IN THE MOUNTAINS OF  PAPERWORK, BUT IT COULD HAVE ESCAPED TO THE MANHATTAN  REGIONAL OFFICE OR MAYBE  D.C..
SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS  IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.
YES.
OKAY. BREAK FOR LUNCH GUYS.
YEAH.
LET'S GO EXTRAS.

I NEEDED BETTER INTEL SO  I TRACKED DOWN A TRIBAL  LOCAL WHO AGREED TO MEET IN  PRIVATE.
I'M SORRY, I DON'T SPEAK  ARABIC.
OH.
CAN I --
CAN WE GET THE LIGHT DOWN  PLEASE. HELLO AS A VETERAN'S  ADVOCATE FOR THE IAVA HE  MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US  WHERE TO LOCATE MANNING'S MISSING CLAIMS FORM.
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S LIKE  FINDING A NEEDLE IN A  HAYSTACK.
WHEN WILL THE VA BE  ON-LINE.
I HAVE BEEN HEARING IT  WILL BE NEXT YEAR FOR THE  LAST THREE YEARS.
HAS ANYONE EVER FOUND  HIGH VALUED TARGET LIKE THIS  AT THE VA?
THEY HAVE A VETERAN WHO  IS WITH ME IN D.C. A FEW  WEEKS AGO. HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR A  YEAR. HE WENT ON TELEVISION AND  TOLD HIS STORY AND LOW AND  BEHOLD THE NEXT DAY HIS  CLAIM WAS FIXED.
GENIUS.
ALL WE NEEDED TO DO WAS  SHOOT 900,000 MEDIA  INTERVIEWS WITH VETERANS AND SHAME THE VA INTO TAKING  ACTION.

OKAY, EVERYBODY, JUST  TELL ME ALL AT ONCE, HOW  LONG YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR BENEFITS.
THERE ISN'T GOING TO  WORK.
WE HIT A DEADEND AND THE  TOP BRASS WAS NO HELP.
NEED TO SEE --
OKAY.
