Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME OWE TO "THE  DAILY SHOW". ANY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE WONDERFUL  JEFF BRIDGES IS GOING TO BE  JOINING US. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO OBVIOUSLY FOR THE PAST FEW  NIGHTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HEAVY,  COMPLEX DIFFICULT TO SOLVE ISSUES LIKE GUN CONTROL, THE  FISCAL GIVE. GIRARD DEPARDU'S HEARD  BREAKING-REALLY HEARTBREAKING --  FROM HIS BELOVED FRANCE. HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE THE PIXAR  CHARACTER OF HIMSELF, DOES HE  NOT? TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN  WITH A LITTLE PIECE WE CALL. ♪ ♪  DISGRACED FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO REAL HARD  TO MAKE (bleep) FUN. YOU KNOW THAT BANK HSBC IT TURNS  OUT THE INITIALS STAND FOR HOLY  (bleep) BANKRUPT.
HSBC IS ACCUSED OF  TRANSFERRING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS  FOR NATIONS LIKE IRAN, DOING BUSINESS WITH FIRMS LINKED TO  TERRORISM AND ENABLING MEXICAN  DRUG CARTELS TO MOVE MONEY THROUGH U.S. SUB SID DAIRIES.
Jon: MONEY LAUNDERING WITH  DRUG CARTELS AND TERRORIST  GROUPS. I AM SURPRISED THAT THOSE PEOPLE  WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH BANKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY HAVE STANDARDS. BANKER SLAM! TURLEY AN INDUSTRY POPULATED  WITH A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO BE SO HARD ON  THESE GUYS. YOU KNOW? THEY DID BUSINESS WITH  TERRORISTS AT THE BANK. EVERYBODY WALKED IN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WERE WORKING  WITH AND COUNSELING ENEMIES ON  HOW TO CIRCUMVENT THE ENTIRE SECURITY APRIL RAT RUSS.
ON AT LEAST ONE OCCASION HSBC  TAUGHT THEM HOW TO FORMAT  MESSAGES SO TRANSACTIONS WOULD NOT BE BLOCKED BY THE UNITED  STATES.
Jon: ARE YOU (bleep)  KIDDING ME? THEY WORKED PERSONALLY WITH  THESE PEOPLE TO HELP THEM --  THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. I CANNOT BELIEVE OUR NATION'S  ENEMIES ARE GETTING BETTER AND  MORE PERSONAL BANK CUSTOMER SERVICE THAN I AM. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO TRANSFER  TO HSBC. WE CAN TAKE SOLIDS. AT LEAST THE HSBC GUYS THEY ARE  GOING TO SEND THEM UP THE RIVER  TO THE BIG HOUSE.
NOT ONE PERSON FROM HSBC WILL  FACE PROSECUTION. THERE'S NO CRIMINAL CHARGES  AGAINST ANY OF THE MANAGERS OR  INDIVIDUALS WHO LEWD THIS TO GO  ON.
Jon: YEAH, NO, OBVIOUSLY  RIVER IS THE BIG HOUSE. BY RIVER I MEAN THE SAME AND BY  BIG HOUSE I MEAN A MANSION ON  IT. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL  UNSATISFYING RISK PUNISHMENT  HERE.
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS  EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE TOMORROW  THAT EUROPE'S BIGGEST BANK HSBC WILL PAY $1.9 BILLION TO SETTLE  MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES.
Jon: OH, WOW. $1.9 BILLION. I MEAN THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM  WEEKS -- [ LAUGHTER ] TO PAY DOWN. WHY EXACTLY NO PROSECUTION?
THE BANK'S LAWYERS HAVE  ARGUED THAT A SUCCESSFUL  PROSECUTION OF HSBC COULD HAVE PUT THE BANK OUT OF BUSINESS IN  THE U.S. COSTING LOTS OF JOBS  AND DISRUPTING FINANCIAL  MARKETS.
U.S. OFFICIALS APPARENTLY  AGREED THAT MANY MANY WAYS HSBC  BECAME SIMPLY TOO TBOIG  PROSECUTE.
Jon: WAIT THAT -- THAT'S A  THING? YOU CAN GET TOO BIG TO -- YOUR  ORGANIZATION CAN REACH A CERTAIN  SIZE AND IMPORTANCE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IT GRANTS YOU  IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION? YOU SOMEHOW SHOOT THE LEGAL MOON  IS THAT WHAT THIS IS? THESE ARE HORRIFIC CRIMES BUT  SINCE YOUR BANK AVES ARE THE  ONLY ONES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, I AM NOT GOING TO WALK FIVE  (bleep) BLOCKS TO A BODEGA  ATM. I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH. SO CARRY ON. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT EVERY UPDATE IN THIS SEGMENT  INVOLVES CRIME AND GREED. THERE'S ALSO ARROGANCE AND  GENERAL DOWCH -- DOUCHEERY. I GIVE YOU AIG. THE COMPANY WE BAILED OUT. THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE A MESSAGE  FOR AMERICA AND CONTRARY TO  COMMERCIALS IT'S NOT THANK YOU.
THERE ARE SOME AIG  SHAREHOLDERS BRING A $25 BILLION  SUIT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THE TERMS OF  BAILOUT WERE TOO ONEROUS.
Jon: SUING THE PEOPLE WHO  GAVE YOU $182 BILLION AND SAVED  YOUR COMPANY. I CAN ONLY ASSUME BECAUSE THAT  ACT FILLED YOUR HEARTS AT AIG  WITH GRATITUDE AND THEN YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM THEN ATTACKED THAT  AS A FOREIGN SUB STANCE BECAUSE  LIKE NATIVE AMERICANS WITH SMALL POX YOU HAD NO PREVIOUS  EXPOSURE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO IS THE GREEDY MOTHER  (bleep) BEHIND THIS LAWSUIT  PLEASE DON'T BE A JEW. PLEASE DON'T BE A JEW.
THE MAN WHO FILED THE LAWSUIT  IS FORMER AIG C.E.O. HANK  GREENBERG.
Jon: NOO! HANK GREENBERG! ALL RIGHT NOT NECESSARILY  JEWISH. HE COULD HAVE CHANGED HIS NAME  FROM STUART. [ LAUGHTER ] BY THE WAY, I'VE NEVER SEEN A  MAN CLOSER TO SAYING THE WORDS  RELEASE THE HOUNDS. [ LAUGHTER ] INTERESTING SIDE NOTE, MAURICE  HANK GREENBERG IS NOT ONLY SUING  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR SO RUDELY SAVING HIS COMPANY, HE IS  ALSO ATTACKING THEM IN A NEW  BOOK SET TO BE PUNISHED JANUARY  29. IT'S THE EXACT SAME DAY THAT I'M  RELEASING MY BOOK WHICH IS IS  CALLED "DON'T BUY MAURICE GREENBERG'S (bleep) BOOK."  IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE BOOK THIS  YEAR ABOUT THE STUPIDITY OF A BOOK MAKE IT" DON'T BUY MAURICE  GREENBERG'S (bleep) BOOK."
IT'S A LUDICROUS ARGUMENT.
TALK ABOUT THE HAND THAT  FEEDS YOU.
THEY HAD A CHOICE. THEY COULD HAVE GONE BANKRUPT  THEY TOOK OUR CASH.
I WAS STUNNED ABOUT. THIS I THINK IT'S CRAZY.
Jon: LET'S REIN IT IN HERE. WHAT AIG SHAREHOLDERS ARE DOING  IS OBJECTIVELY ALL OF, BUT  SHOCK, SURPRISING? AIG, THEY PUT THE A IN  (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED  RIGHT AFTER WE GAVE THEM THE  BAILOUT MONEY IN 2008?
ONLY DAYS AFTER TAXPAYERS  PROVIDED $85 BILLION TO BAILOUT  AIG, COMPANY EXECUTIVES CAME HERE FOR A WEEK-LONG RETREAT,  WINING, DINING AND GOLF.
Jon: IF ANYTHING THE ONLY  THING AIG IS GUILTY OF IS  CONSISTENCY, THAT AND A SERIES OF CATASTROPHIC INVESTMENTS THAT  BROUGHT THE WORLD TO THE BRINK  OF ARMAGEDDON BUT THAT WAS PRETTY CONSISTENT. YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THE  LAWSUIT IS BASED ON.
THE LAWSUIT CLAIMS THE TERMS  OF BAILOUT INCLUDING THE HIGH  INTEREST RATE IT HAD TO PAY WERE UNFAIR TO SHAREHOLDERS. THIS SATE TERMS DEPRIVED  SHAREHOLDERS OF TENS OF BILLIONS  OF DOLLARS.
Jon: GUY WHO USED TO RUN  AIG IS MAD BECAUSE WHEN HIS  COMPANY WAS HIT BY A CALAMITY THEY CLEARLY WEREN'T PREPARED  FOR THEM THE GROUP THAT STEPPED  IN TO PROVIDE FUNDS THIS THEY NEED ASSESSED THE COMPANY AND  THOUGHT THEY HAD A PREEXISTING  CONDITION CALLED THE MONEY IS ALL GONE REA SO THEY CHARGED  THEM A HIGHER RATE ALMOST TAKING  ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPANY, PROFITING FROM THEIR MISFORTUNE  IF YOU WILL CSM DID THAT UPSET  YOU, AIG,? IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS YOUR BUSINESS  MODEL. SUE ME? NO, NO SUE YOU.
