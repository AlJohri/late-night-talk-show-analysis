[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW MOVIE AND HE HAS ENTITLED IT "NEIGHBORS."
THIS IS OUR HOME.
IT'S OUR HOME. THIS IS OUR LITTLE CUB ON OUR LAWN WITH A CONDOM IN HER MOUTH OH MY GOD, I'M A MAMA BEAR.
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO ACT ALL DOCILE, AND THEN [ROARS]
GET THEM. MY CLAWS ARE OUT. LOOK AT ME, I'M JUST A REGULAR DAD AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS? BOOM, BOOM, TEDDY IS DEAD. PETE'S DEAD. SCOONIE'S DEAD. KILL THEM! BOOM.
NO.
I'M BUYING A GUN.
NO, YOU ARE NOT.
I'M NOT BUYING A GUN. YOU'RE RIGHT. BAD IDEA.
BAD CALL. WHAT ABOUT ONE OF THOSE SMALL PROSTITUTE GUNS.
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SETH ROGEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: TIRED.
JUST TIRED.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO BE TIRED, TOO. HOW MANY OF THESE INTERVIEWS DO YOU THINK YOU'VE DONE FOR THIS MOVIE?
REALISTICALLY? AROUND 7,000. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ARE WE THE 7,000th.
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.
Jon: FOR REAL?
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE LAST TIME I'LL EVER SPEAK ABOUT THIS MOVIE IN PUBLIC FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY HERE.
YES.
Jon: TO SAY SOMETHING PROFOUND OR NOT ABOUT THIS MOVIE THAT YOU HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO SAY. THE ONE THING THAT IN YOUR MIND YOU HAVE WANTED TO SAY AND 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE NOT ASKED YOU. IT'S INSIDE OF YOU, IT'S TEARING YOU APART.
YEAH, IT'S FOR KIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AH, YOU WERE SO CLOSE. THAT IS ACTUALLY -- THIS DOES ALSO PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY. YOU'VE DONE SO MANY INTERVIEWS --
YEAH.
IT'S ALL BUILT UP TO THIS ONE MOMENT OF OPENING IT, AND YOU COULD ALSO RUIN IT.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING WHEN YOU STARTED GOING. I WAS LIKE YEAH, I'M LIKE ONE RACIAL SLUR AWAY FROM CRASHING IT ALL. I COULD UNDO 7,000 INTERVIEWS RIGHT NOW SOMEHOW. I WON'T DO IT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S DONALD STERLING THIS (bleep). LET'S DONALD STERLING THIS (bleep).
WORST COMES TO WORST I OWN A BASKETBALL TEAM AT THE END OF DAY. SO, THAT'S NOT BAD.
Jon: IT'LL BE PERFECT.
HE'S DOING WELL. [LAUGHTER]
IS THERE, HAVE YOU EVER DONE A MOVIE WHERE YOU THOUGHT I JUST CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS?
I'VE DONE SOME, I'VE DONE SOME WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT. YES.
Jon: BUT THIS ONE IS GOOD.
THIS ONE IS VERY GOOD AND MOST OF MY MOVIES I REALLY LIKE WHICH MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO NOT -- SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M LYING TO EVERYBODY, BASICALLY. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU KNOW HE IT'S NOT FUNNY YOU STILL HAVE TO SAY IT'S FUNNY. YOU CAN'T COME HERE AND BE LIKE IT'S NOT THAT GOOD. IT WOULD BE, IT WOULD BE BIZARRE. IT WOULD BE WEIRD TO SEE. PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE THAT.
Jon: IF YOU DID THAT, IF YOU DID THAT, I BELIEVE THE ANTI-CAMPAIGN WOULD DRAW PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE.
MAYBE IT WOULD. YOU'RE LIKE HOW IS THIS MOVIE SO BAD THAT HE'S WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT ON TELEVISION.
Jon: YES. AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD SAY I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
I'VE GOT TO SEE THAT MOVIE, YEAH.
Jon: THIS MUST BE HISTORICALLY BAD, AS A MOVIE.
IT'S A GOOD CAMPAIGN. IT MAY COME TO THAT ONE DAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO, NO, NO. THIS ONE IS QUITE GOOD. DO YOU SEE THEM BEFORE? BECAUSE I'M CURIOUS, IF YOU DIDN'T DIRECT IT OR YOU WEREN'T EDITING IT OR YOU WEREN'T DOING THAT, WOULD YOU ALWAYS SEE IT OR YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW?
I PRODUCED IT SO I'VE SEEN IT LIKE TONS AND TONS AND TONS OF TIMES. YEAH, USUALLY BY THE TIME, I WOULD ASK TO SEE IT SO I KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE OF LYING I'M TELLING TO PEOPLE. BASICALLY. [ LAUGHTER ] OUT THERE, YEAH. BUT I WOULD ASK, YEAH, SO I CRAFT MY STORY BASICALLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE GAME.
NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE GAME.
Jon: THIS IS ALSO THE LAST CHANCE, I KNOW THERE'S A HUGE JUSTIN BIEBER AND YOU BATTLE.
YES, IT'S GOING DOWN TO A FIGHT IN A PARKING LOT SOMEWHERE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST CATCHING UP, YOU'VE HAD SOME NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH HIM AS A NON-GENTLEMANLY FELLA.
HE WAS A LITTLE OBNOXIOUS TO ME. YEAH.
Jon: A LITTLE OBNOXIOUS.
YEAH, HE WAS OBNOXIOUS.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT HURTS ME MOST ABOUT THIS.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU KNOW THE GIRL HE WENT OUT WITH?
YES.
Jon: THE SELENA GOMEZ.
YES.
Jon: SO I HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN AND SHE WAS THE WINNER OF THE FAMILY WIZARD COMPETITION ON WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE. THAT WAS HER SHOW.
YES, YES. OF COURSE. YES, YES.
Jon: THEY WERE ENGAGED IN A REAL BATTLE FOR FOUR YEARS.
OVER WHO WOULD BE THE WIZARD OF WAVERLY PLACE?
Jon: EXACTLY. SHE ENDED UP WINNING. MY KIDS REALLY RESPECTED THAT VICTORY. [LAUGHTER]
AND IT'S DIMINISHED BY HER ASSOCIATION WITH JUSTIN BIEBER TO SOME DEGREE.
Jon: HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT TO THEM? SHE'S A WIZARD AND NOW SHE'S HANGING OUT WITH A DOUCHEBAG.
WITH A DOUCHE, YEAH.
Jon: HOW DO I EXPLAIN THAT? TO MY KIDS? I HAVE CHILDREN.
IT'S TRUE. THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.
Jon: WHAT DO DO?  YOU HAVE, WHAT DO YOU HAVE NOW?
I HAVE NO KIDS.
Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS?
NO, NO. I HAVE A DOG. BUT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW JUSTIN BIEBER IS A DOUCHE BAG. SHE SEEMS ACCEPTING OF IT ACTUALLY.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT. THE DOG KNOWS.
THE DOGS KNOWS. THEY CAN SMELL,  IF A DOG CAN SMELL ONE THING IT'S (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:  THAT IS AN OUTLINE OF AN INTERVIEW IF I HAVE EVER HEARD AN OUTLINE OF AN INTERVIEW. WE'RE GOING TO STOP THERE. FOR THAT TO BE THE LAST LINE OF YOUR 7,000 INTERVIEWS.
IT'S TRUE. IT'S POETIC AND BEAUTIFUL IN A WAY.
Jon: I THINK IT'S POETIC. I I'M NOT GOING TO TRY ANYMORE. "NEIGHBORS" IS VERY GOOD. HE'S NOT LYING TO YOU. IT IS VERY FUNNY. IT WILL BE IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. SETH ROGEN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
