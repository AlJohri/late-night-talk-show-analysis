FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST AUTHOR WILLIAM COHAN TO TALK ABOUT THE DUKE LACROSSE SCANDAL, THE PRICE OF SILENCE. $3.99. IT COSTS $3.99. THAT'S THE PRICE OF SILENCE. BUT FIRST, THERE'S BREAKING NEWS IN THE CASE OF L.A. CLIPPERS OWNER DONALD STERLING. HE HAS COME UNDER FIRE FOR HIS THOUGHTS ON THE INSTAGRAM-ABILITY OF -- OF I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT GIRLFRIEND AND BLACK PERSON FRIENDSHIP.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, I AM BANNING MR. STERLING FOR LIFE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YES!
FROM ANY ASSOCIATION WITH THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION OR THE NBA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] â™ª
Jon: WOW. SO MUCH EXCITEMENT OUT THERE. SO MUCH EXCITEMENT OUT THERE FROM THE ENTIRE WORLD AND EVEN APPARENTLY THE PAST. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S GOOD TO SEE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND CONSEQUENCE FREE SPEECH. MY GUESS IS THIS IS NOT THE DEATH NELL FOR THIS COUNTRY'S LONG AND PROUD TRADITION OF CRAZY TALK.
IF I WERE IN CHARGE -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ALL I CAN SAY THERE IS THANK GOD THAT IS A HYPOTHETICAL.
THEY WOULD KNOW THAT WATERBOARDING IS HOW WE BAPTIZE TERRORISTS. [LAUGHTER]
JON: HUH? THAT IS SARAH PALIN GIVING A SPEECH WHERE SHE IS SOMEHOW CONFLATING A SACRAMENT OF HER FAITH WITH TORTURE IN ORDER TO SOMEHOW BRING THE FEAR OF GOD TO RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T EVEN -- WHERE IS THAT SPEECH EVEN APPROPRIATE AT AN AL QAEDA RECRUITMENT HOW-TO VIDEO WORKSHOP? AT THE YEARLY GATHERING OF THE DUMMOLOS OR MAYBE SHE'S GIVING ONE OF THOSE FAMED HUH TALKS. THEY ARE LIKE TED TALKS EXCEPT THEY MAKE NO SENSE. WELL, SO -- TED TALKS. [LAUGHTER] SO, WHAT ELSE DID THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF ONE OF TWO MAJOR NATIONAL PARTIES TELL WHOEVER IT IS SHE IS TALKING TO.
JOE BIDEN, REMEMBER THIS HE TELLING WOMEN BEFORE AN ASSAULT JUST A FIRE WARNING SHOT UNTIL THE COPS SHOW UP. JUST AIM UP IN THE AIR. THAT WAS HIS DIRECTIVE. HIS ADVICE. WELL FINE, JOE SQUIRT GUN, IF YOUR RAPIST IS A BIRD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SHE SEEMS NICE. [LAUGHTER] SO I SEE. WELL, THE FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR WITH A CLEAR AND QUITE RYE REFERENCE TO THE WELL KNOWN GREEK MYTH LEDA AND THE SWAN. ZEUS IN THE FORM OF A SWAN FORCED HIMSELF ON LEDA  DAUGHTER OF THESTIUS, KING OF AETOLIA LEADING TO THE BIRTH OF HELEN OF TROY YADA YADA YADA SMASH CUT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DISCOVERS AMERICA AND THUS THE FOUNDING FATHERS CREATE THE GREATEST COUNTRY GOD HAS EVER GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF EARTH. WELL PLAYED, GOVERNOR, YOU DO READ, ALL OF THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] WHERE EXACTLY WAS A SPEECH SUCH AS THIS APPROPRIATE?
SARAH PALIN STIRRED UP CONTROVERSY AT THE NRA CONVENTION.
Jon: OH THE NRA CONVENTION. THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. I BELIEVE IT'S SOME SORT OF GENTLEMEN'S SPORTING GROUP ORGANIZED IN THE LATE 19th CENTURY TO PROMOTE PROPER MARKSMANSHIP. I LOOK FORWARD TO REMARKS ON GOOD HUNTING ETIQUETTE AND WEAPONS HYGIENE FROM THE NRA EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT THE IN NO WAY UNDERMEDICATED WAYNE LA PIERRE.
WE KNOW, IN THE WORLD THAT SURROUNDS US, THERE ARE TERRORISTS, HOME INVADERS, DRUG CARTELS, CARJACKERS, KNOCKOUT GAMERS, RAPERS, HATERS, CAMPUS KILLERS, AIRPORT KILLERS, SHOPPING MALL KILLERS AND KILLERS WHO SCHEME TO DESTROYED OUR COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DADDY SCARED. [LAUGHTER] WELL, I SEE THE NRA HAS CHANGED ITS MISSION FROM FIREARM SAFETY TO DEFENDING THE ALAMO. I GUESS THE NRA BELIEVES THAT THE THIN LINE -- [LAUGHTER] -- I GUESS THE NRA BELIEVES THE THIN LINE BETWEEN CIVILIZATION AND THUNDER DOME IS AN ARMED TO CAPACITY CITIZENRY READY TO STAND UP TO TERRORISTS AND FOR SOME REASON AS MR. LA PIERRE STATED HATERS. BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN TOLD MANY, MANY TIMES HATERS GONNA HATE. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS THEY ARE SAYING YOU MUST ARM YOURSELF AGAINST IMMINENT PHYSICAL THREAT.
WHETHER THERE'S THROUGH OBAMACARE, WHETHER IT'S THROUGH REDEFINING MARRIAGE, YOU NAME IT THEY ARE COMING AT US.
Jon: AND THAT'S WHEN (bleep) GOT WEIRD. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THE PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE SUPPORT FOR SANE GUN OWNERSHIP GOT MIXED UP IN THE WHOLE NATIONAL CULTURE WAR MESS. WHY WOULD YOU BE TALKING ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES AT A GUN CONVENTION UNLESS YOU THINK SOMEHOW GUNS ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THESE CULTURAL DISAGREEMENTS.
THEY THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULD PICK YOUR SOFT DRINK, YOUR SNACK FOOD, YOUR VICES, YOUR HOME SECURITY SYSTEM, YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE, YOUR ELECTRICITY SOURCE AND YOUR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL AS WELL.
Jon: AND THAT'S WHY YOU NEED A GUN.
SELENDRA, BENGHAZI, FAST AND FURIOUS, OBAMACARE.
Jon: AND THAT IS WHY YOU NEED A GUN. THE NRA CONVENTION IS LIKE A FORTUNE COOKIE GAME IN BED EXCEPT HERE THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS YOU NEED A GUN. IT'S A HILARIOUS AND MISGUIDED GAME LIKE TENNIS DARTS.
I THINK WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND FACE THE MUSIC. AMERICA HAS CHANGED. AMERICA HAS CHANGED. WE'RE NOT THE SAME COUNTRY. THE OTHER SIDE IS WINNING.
Jon: THAT'S WHY YOU NEED A GUN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, HERE IS WHAT THEY MISSED. WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS WINNING ARE ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW, PEACEFUL CONTESTS BETWEEN COMPETING VIEWPOINTS AND YOUR SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE LESS WE NEED MORE ELECTABLE CANDIDATES AND A MORE NUANCED VIEWPOINT AND MORE LOCK AND LOAD MOTHER (bleep). AND THE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS, YOU KNOW, THE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS THAT AIN'T HELPING.
THEY LIKE TO PAINT US AS PARANOID BITTER PEOPLE.
NO, NO. WE ASKED YOU TO PAINT US A SELF PORTRAIT AND THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE WE WOULD FIND YOUR MISSION LESS PARANOID IF THE VISION OF THE WORLD YOU PRESENT RESEMBLED IN ANYWAY THE WORLD.
GUN SALES LAST YEAR WERE UP NATIONWIDE AND 30 NEW PROGUN LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED JUST THIS YEAR.
Jon: AND IT'S ONLY APRIL. AND MAY IS NATIONAL CONTINUED TO LOOSEN ANY AND ALL GUN RESTRICTIONS MONTH. (bleep) HALLMARK. LOOK WHAT THEY JUST DID A FEW DAYS AGO IN GEORGIA.
GOVERNOR NATHAN DEAL SIGNED THE SAFE CARRY PROTECTION ACT OF 2014.
Jon: WELL ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT SO BAD. THE SAFE CARRY PROTECTION ACT. IT'S GOT THE WORD SAFE IN IT AND GOT THE WORD PROTECTION IN IT. THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS OKAY.
CRITICS ARE CALLING IT THE GUNS EVERYWHERE LAW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT SOUNDS WORSE. [LAUGHTER] JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHERE WILL THIS SAFE PROTECTIVE CARRYING BE TAKING PLACE?
WHEN THE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT ON JULY 1ST, FIREARMS WILL BE ALLOWED INSIDE UNSECURED PUBLIC BUILDINGS LIKE LIBRARIES AND RECREATIONAL CENTERS AND PARTS OF AIRPORTS THAT LIE OUTSIDE SECURITY CHECKPOINTS.
Jon: WHY WOULD YOU TAKE A GUN TO THE AIRPORT? TRYING TO GET THE ATTENTION OF THE PERSON YOU ARE PICKING UP. IT'S OVER HERE AUNT PATTY. PATTY OVER HERE! [LAUGHTER] WE GOTTA WAIT FOR LUGGAGE. ALL RIGHT. BUT ANYWAY, THAT'S HARDLY GUNS EVERYWHERE.
THEY CAN BE BROUGHT INTO BARS AND HOUSES OF WORSHIP, TEACHERS AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS CAN ALSO CARRY THEIR GUNS INTO CLASSROOMS SO LONG AS THE DISTRICT ALLOWS IT.
Jon: CLASSROOMS. IT'S NOT JUST GUN RIGHTS IT'S EDUCATION REFORM. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, HEY YOU WANT TO COME UP HERE AND SOLVE SIX TIMES NINE? DO YOU, PUNK? [LAUGHTER] DO YOU? [LAUGHTER] DON'T WORRY EVEN GEORGIA'S DEEPLY CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATURE PUT SOME COMMON SENSE RESTRICTIONS WHERE GUNS CANNOT GO.
THERE IS A GOVERNMENT BUILDING WHERE GUNS ARE NOT ALLOWED AND THAT'S THE STATE CAPITAL.
Jon: BOOYA! YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. ONE OF ONLY PLACES GEORGIA'S LEGISLATURES DIDN'T ALLOW GUNS IS IN THE BUILDING WHERE THEY WORK. THEY ARE THE VOYEURS AT THE ORGY, Y'ALL GO ON AND DO WHAT YOU DO, WE JUST LIKE TO WATCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
