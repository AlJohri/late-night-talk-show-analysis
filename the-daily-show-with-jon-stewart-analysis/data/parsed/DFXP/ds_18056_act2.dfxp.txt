Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. YOU KNOW, OVER THE YEARS  TECHNOLOGY HAS DONE AN ALL OF  LOT FOR US AS PEOPLE. INCREASED PRODUCT ACTIVITY,  DEMOM TIES THE INFORMATION AX  LOVES US TO CRUSH FIVE PIGS WITH ONLY ONE BIRD. COMPLETELY REVOLUTIONIZED CAT  TRANSPORTATION. WHY ARE YOU GOING? NO, YOU ARE NOT? OKAY. OKAY. TECHNOLOGY AND ITS SHORT COMINGS  IS THE SUBJECT OF NEW  REOCCURRING SEGMENT JON STEWART UPLOADS A STREAM -- I'D LIKE TO  TALK ABOUT REFRAMING THE  SEGMENT. FIRST OFF, ROBOTS. WE KNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING OUR  WARS AND BOXING IN PLACE OF HUGH  JACKMAN -- [LAUGHTER] -- BUT DID YOU KNOW THEY ARE  STEALING OUR FACTORY JOBS.
A FRIENDLY AFFORDABLE CHAP  NAMED BAXTER.
IT'S MEANT TO GO TO A FACTORY  WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE ROBOTS AT  THE MOMENT AND ORDINARY WORKERS CAN TRAIN IT TO DO SIMPLE TASKS.
Jon: TASKS SO SIMPLE EVEN A  HUMAN CAN DO THEM OR AT LEAST A  HUMAN USED TO DO THEM. TELL ME WHERE IT GETS CREEPY.
BAXTER COSTS 22,000. HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?
THREE YEARS.
Jon: THAT'S A REASONABLE  BE. IT'S WELL-3 HAD THE 46 AN HOUR,  THE WAGES OF THE COMPANIES.
THAT'S NOT UNREASONABLE  COMPARISON TO MAKE.
YOU COULD BUY ONE OF THESE  ROBOTS AND IT WOULD BE LIKE  GETTING A CHINESE WORKER.
Jon: IT DID FOR A SECOND  SEEM LIKE STEVE CROFT WAS  LOOKING TO BUY SOME CHINESE  WORKERS. I PICKED UP A COUPLE OF CHINESE  GUYS FOR $10,000 EACH. GOOD DEAL? NO, WHAT? 60 MINUTES IS SO STUFFY. GIVE ME A NEWS MAN I CAN RELATE  TO.
A LOT OF ITEMS ABOUT THE  HEALTH AND WELL BEING INCLUDING  THE FACT THAT FULL-ON -- FACEBOOK CAN FULL-ON BUM YOU  OUT.
Jon: THANK YOU BRA. TALK TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF  THE YOUTH WHICH MAKES ME FEEL  GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH VERY, VERY OLD. WHAT ABOUT FACEBOOK PUTS US AT  RISK FOR THE BUMMING.
RESEARCHERS CALL IT FACEBOOK  ENVY. IT'S THE ACT OF VIEWING YOUR  FRIENDS FABULOUS VACATIONS,  LOVELY CHILDREN, ATTRACTIVE FRIENDS AND GREAT SOCIAL LIVES. THE RESEARCH SHOWED IT CAN LEAVE  PEOPLE FEELING LONELY,  FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M NOT A DOCTOR, BUT  IF YOU GET UPSET BECAUSE OTHER  PEOPLE ARE HAPPY, IT SEEMS YOUR PROBLEM MIGHT NOT BE FACEBOOK  BUT THAT YOU ARE AN (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] WHO ARE THESE (bleep)?
THE STUDY LOOKED AT GERMAN  COLLEGE STUDENTS. ONE OUT OF THREE OF THEM SAID  THAT THEY HAD FEELINGS, SPECIFIC  FEELINGS SUCH AS ANGER, FRUSTRATION OR IRRITATION WHEN  THEY USED FACEBOOK.
Jon: THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM --  YOU USED GERMAN COLLEGE  STUDENTS. FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY IS HOW  GERMANS FEEL ABOUT PUPPIES. THEY ARE GERMAN. A BIRTHDAY CARD FROM GRANDMA. ONLY TEN DEUTSCHES GRANDMOTHER! THEY ARE GERMANS. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. SO FACEBOOK SUCKS BUT NOTHING IS  WRONG WITH TWITTER, RIGHT? IT CAN TOPPLE EGYPTIAN  GOVERNMENTS TO NEW YORK  CONGRESSMEN.
WHAT IS THE VIDEO VERSION OF  A TWEET?
Jon: A VEET, TWIDEO, THOSE  ARE THE NAMES OF IKEA CHAIRS. WAIT, WHAT IS IT CALLED?
IT'S A VINE. IT'S A VIDEO SERVICE UNVEILED BY  TWITTER TODAY. THEY HAVE TO SHORT, SIX SECONDS  OR LESS.
Jon: OF COURSE, FIVE  SECONDS IS WAY TOO SHORT AND  SEVEN SECONDS, COME ON, HE HAD IT YOUR IS. WHAT CAN YOU DO IN SIX SECONDS.
FASTER THAN -- IT TURNED INTO  A NAUGHTY SEARCH ENGINE.
PORNOGRAPHY ISN'T PROHIBITED  AND ALLOWING SEXUALLY EXPLICIT  VIDEOS TO RUN RAMPANT. SIMPLY SEARCHING PORN.
Jon: SIX SECONDS OF PORN. THAT'S FOR MORE SECONDS THAN  ANYBODY WOULD NEED, ISN'T IT? [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE PEOPLE, STING? [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE THEY TANTRIC? SERIOUSLY, SIX SECONDS. [LAUGHTER] TWITTER'S BRIEF VIDEO  APPLICATION WAS USED FOR PORN  WHICH MAKES IT A SHOW-IN FOR LEAST SURPRISING DEVELOPMENT  SINCE STEVE IRWIN DIED OF ANIMAL  RELATED INJURIES. TOO SOON? I CAN GET YOU BEING SURPRISED  THAT A ROBOT WOULD TAKE A HUMAN  JOB OR FACEBOOK IS DEPRESSING BUT HOW IS THIS USED IN ANYTHING  ON THE INTERNET IS ALMOST  IMMEDIATELY USED FOR PORN. ALEX DOCTOR GRAHAM'S FIRST WORDS  ON THE TELEPHONE WERE, WATSON
