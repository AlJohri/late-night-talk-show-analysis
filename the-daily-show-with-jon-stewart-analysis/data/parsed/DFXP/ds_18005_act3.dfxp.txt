(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE LEAD  GUITARIST AND PRINCIPAL  SONGWRITER FOR THE LEGENDARY  BAND THE WHO. HIS NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY IS CALLED  "WHO I AM."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  PETE TOWNSEND. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   HOW ARE YOU?
I'M ALL RIGHT  Jon: I'M SO PLEASED THAT  YOU'RE HERE. I SPENT SO MANY HOURS WITH YOUR  MUSIC
I'M NOT GOING TO HELP DISCUSS  AMERICAN POLITICS.
Jon: PLEASE. YOU'D BE THE ONLY ONE HERE AT  THE TABLE WHO CAN. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON
I'VE NOTICED THAT. Jon: I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND  WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. THIS BOOK IS VERY THICK. HOW HARD IS IT...
THANK YOU  Jon: ... FOR A ROCK STAR WHO  HAS LIVED THE LIFE THAT YOU HAVE  LIVED TO REMEMBER THIS? AND HOW MUCH OF THIS DO YOU  BELIEVE REALLY HAPPENED?
I'M NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER GUYS  THAT YOU HAVE ON HERE
Jon: WHAT? I DO REMEMBER. MY MEMORY IS REALLY GOOD  PARTICULARLY WHEN I USED TO  DRINK A LOT
Jon: REALLY? THAT PICKLES YOUR MEMORY.
(LAUGHING)  Jon: KEPT IT PRESERVED  I DO HAVE A SORT OF SENSE OF  PICKLEMENT. IN FACT I HAD A LOT OF PAPER. YOU KNOW, I HAD STUFF WHERE I  HAD WRITTEN LYRICS ON THE ROAD. IT WOULD BE HOLIDAY INN, ROLLING  MEADOWS, YOU KNOW. WON'T GET IT AGAIN. ALL I HAD TO DO WAS LOOK IN MY  BOOK AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY WERE  IN ROLLING MEADOWS ON APRIL 15,  19-WHATEVER IT WAS. I WOULD MOVE WHERE I WAS, WHERE  I HAD WRITTEN THAT LYRIC. THAT KIND OF THING HELPED ME A  LOT. I SAVE BITS OF PAPER. I SAVE NOTES AND LETTERS. IT WAS QUITE EASY TO REMEMBER. MY MEMORY FOR INCIDENTS WAS  GOOD. I WOULDN'T WRITE CRAZY THINGS  DOWN BUT I RETOLD THE STORIES SO  OFTEN THAT THEY BECAME KIND OF  LITTLE MOVIES. IT WAS VERY EASY TO WRITE A  BOOK.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL... I WONDER  IF IN TODAY'S AGE OF SOCIAL  MEDIA TWITTER AND FACEBOOK AND  WITH EVERYONE KNOWING... WHEN I READ SOME OF THESE STORIES  THEY'RE SO VIVID AND SO  DESTRUCTIVE. COULD THE BAND HAVE BEEN THE WAY  THEY WERE IN THIS CURRENT  ENVIRONMENT OR WAS THIS JUST A  SPECIAL TIME WHERE THERE WAS SORT OF A FREEDOM TO DO THINGS  THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO  NOW?
I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I THINK... LOOKING BACK  THE THING WAS WE WERE UNDER A  MICROSCOPE. AS YOU WOULD BE TODAY. BUT NOT IN THE SAME WAY. ARTISTS TODAY NOT ONLY ARE  SUBJECTED TO INCREDIBLE SCRUTINY  BUT THEY WILLINGLY PUT UP THEIR  LIVES ON TWITTER. EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO. AND, YOU KNOW, THEIR  RELATIONSHIPS, WHERE THEY'RE  GOING. THE MOVEMENTS FROM PLACE TO  PLACE. SOME POLITICIANS DO THIS NOW  TOO. I DON'T DO SWITTER. I'M NOT ON FACEBOOK. BUT I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST  ARTISTS TO DO MY OWN WEBSITE  LIKE A BLOG. IN THE DAYS WHEN, YOU KNOW, YOU  WOULD GO TO SOMETHING LIKE BLOG  SPOT AND YOU WOULD SEE SOME VERY  INTERESTING STUFF. YOU KNOW, STUFF WHICH IS BEING  DISCUSSED NOW IS BEING POSSIBLY  NOT SO GREAT. I REMEMBER READING ABOUT A MUM  WHO HAD GIVEN A BIRTH TO THE  CHILD AND THERE WERE PICTURES OF  THE WHOLE PERIOD OF HER PREGNANCY, HAVING THE BABY. ALL OF THAT STUFF WAS VERY NEW  THEN. NOW PEOPLE ARE DISCUSSING THAT. IS IS THAT GOOD FOR THE KID? WELL, WE DON'T KNOW YET. BUT IN MY BLOG, I USED TO TALK  ABOUT WHAT I WAS DOING, WHERE I  WAS GOING, WHAT I WAS WRITING. I FEEL AFTER A MONTH OF DOING  THIS, I CHECK MY STATS. THERE WERE MANY MANY MANY HITS. I'M THINKING, OH, WOW, 10,000  HITS. IT WAS ABOUT 30 PEOPLE.
Jon: (LAUGHING)  MAYBE 400 AT THE MOST BUT  THEY JUST SPENT THE WHOLE DAY  CHECKING, YOU KNOW. WHAT IS PETE DOING NOW? WHAT IS PETE DOING NOW?
Jon: 0 VERY OBSESSED FANS. THAT'S IT.
THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT  HAD COMPUTERS. THIS WAS WAY BACK.
Jon: THE AMAZING THING IS THE  SOCIAL TIMES THAT YOU SPENT WITH  THE ROLLING STONES, THE BEATLES, THE BEACH BOYS, YOU WRITE MICK  JAG OR WAS THE ONLY MAN YOU EVER  SAW THAT YOU THOUGHT, "I'D HAVE  SEX WITH THAT GUY." LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HAVE YOU  MET NBC NEWS' BRIAN WILLIAMS? COMING FOR YOU, WILLIAMS. WAS THERE A JEALOUSY AMONGST THE  BANDS? A CAMARADERIE, A FEELING LIKE WE  ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD  WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT EACH OTHER  IS DEALING WITH?
I THINK WHAT YOU SAID IS  TRUE. THAT'S IT. WE WERE ALSO... WE ALL... WELL,  THERE WAS ENOUGH SPACE THEN THAT  YOU COULD BE IN YOUR OWN  BALLPARK AND NOT INVADE ANYBODY  ELSE'S. YOU KNOW, THE STONES WERE THE  STONES. THE BEATLES WERE THE BEATLES. THE WHO WERE THE WHO. YOU KNOW, WE ALL PLENTY OF LEG  ROOM. TODAY, YOU KNOW, THE MUSIC  BUSINESS IS JUST AWASH WITH  INCREDIBLY TALENTED YOUNG  PEOPLE, INCREDIBLY TALENTED. THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING AND  LEARNING MUSIC SINCE THEY WERE  BABIES, SOME OF THEM. THEY EMERGE WITH THEIR COMPUTER  MUSIC OUT OF THE BOX ON THE WEB. YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO ANY OF  THESE SEARCH ENGINES AND LISTEN  TO MUSIC. YOU BECOME OVERWHELMED WITH HOW  MUCH FANTASTIC STUFF THERE IS  THERE. WITH US THERE WERE JUST THREE OR  FOUR BANDS. REALLY TRULY. NOT MANY AT ALL. DIDN'T HAVE THE BIG STUFF. THERE WAS COMPETITION BUT IT  WASN'T AS STEEP
Jon: DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES  TO STICK AROUND
SURE  Jon: WE HAVE HERE WHO I AM. THE GREAT PETE TOWNSEND, LADIES  AND
