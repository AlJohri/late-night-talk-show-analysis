Jon:  WELCOME TO THE  "DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. THANK YOU. IN MY-- IN MY CONTINUING EFFORT  TO MAKE MYSELF LOOK AS MUCH LIKE  A KEEBLER ELF AS POSSIBLE, OUR  GUEST TONIGHT MAGIC JOHNSON WILL BE JOINING US.   ( APPLAUSE )   HAVE WE HAD ANYBODY-- I THINK  FLAFT TWO WEEKS HAVE, WE HAD  ANYBODY UNDER, LIKE, 6'6" ON THE  SHOW? EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN ON THE  SHOW GIVES ME A RIDE HOME IN  THEIR POCKET. ( LAUGHTER )  LET'S JUCH RIGHT INTO THE BIG  STORY WITH OUR CONTINUING  COVERAGE OF DEMOCALYPSE 2012. ( LAUGHTER )
I-- I HOPE YOU HAVE DOLBY AT  HOME. BECAUSE THAT'S--  ( LAUGHTER )  FOLKS, ELECTION WATCHERS ARE  ALWAYS POISED THIS LATE IN THE  CAMPAIGN SEASON FOR WHAT THEY REFER TO AS AN OCTOBER SURPRISE. IT APPEARS THAT TIME IS UPON US. AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENT  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WHERE BARACK  OBAMA UNVEILED HIS EXPLOSIVE  OCTOBER SURPRISE THAT HE HAS GIVEN UP. ( LAUGHTER ). SURPRISE! ( APPLAUSE )  EVEN THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED  TO HIS LESS-THAN-STELLAR  PERFORMANCE.
AFTER THE DEBATE I HAD A  BUNCH OF FOLKS COME TO ME, DON'T  BE SO POLITE. DON'T BE SO NICE. WHAT WAS BEING PRESENTED WASN'T  LEADERSHIP. THAT'S SALESMANSHIP.
Jon:  RIGHT, BUT  SALESMANSHIP IS THE THING YOU  INVARIABLY NEED TO ACQUIRE  LEADERSHIP. ( LAUGHTER )  BY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK ANYONE  WAS SUGGESTED YOU NEED TO BE  POLITE. THAT YOU JUST SHOUT, YEAH,  ( BLEEP ) LIAR!"  PEOPLE ARE JUST SUGGESTING YOU  STAND UP TO MR. ROMNEY "WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOU'RE A ( BLEEP )  LIAR!"  YOU PUT THAT FIRST PART ON IT. OF COURSE, DURING THE DEBATE  GOVERNOR ROMNEY LEFT HIMSELF  OPEN TO COUNTER-ATTACK AS WELL.
I'M SORRY, JIM, I'M GOING TO  STOP THE SUBSIDY TO PBS. I'M GOING TO STOP OTHER THINGS. I LIKE PBS. I LIKE BIG BIRD GLO IT'S GREAT  MUPPET CAPER. NAMING AS HIS ONLY SPECIFIC  BUDGET CUT, THE RELATIVE  PITTANCE THAT IS PBS AND  CHILDREN'S TELEVISION WORKED  SHOP.
THANK GOODNESS SOMEBODY IS  FINALLY GETTING TOUGH ON BIG  BIRD.
Jon:  JABY-JAB! EXCELLENT NEXT-DAY COMEBACK. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  WELL DONE.   ( APPLAUSE )   YES. IT'S THAT 3:00 A.M. "OH, THAT'S  WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SAID! OH, M! THE SASSY COUNTER-PUNCH ALONG  WITH THE RECENT DECENT JOBS  REPORTS AND DEBT TO G.D.P. HAVING HIT A LOW,.
MITT ROMNEY MAY HAVE WON THE  DEBATE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA WON THE  POSTDEBATE.
Jon:  SEE! THE POSTDEBATE. AT THAT RATE, OKAY, FINE, OBAMA  MAY LOSE THE ELECTION, BUT HE'LL  WIN THE POSTELECTION. ( LAUGHTER ). NOVEMBER MAY SUCK, BUT THAT GUY  IS GOING TO HAVE A SWEET  DECEMBER. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE AMMO,  THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT, OBAMA  IS GOING TO GET ON IT, I THINK.
I'M BARACK OBAMA AND I  APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
IT'S ME, BIG BIRD.
BIG,IEL OH, A MENACE TO OUR  ECONOMY. MITT ROMNEY KNOWS IT'S NOT WALL  STREET YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. IT'S SESAME STREET. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )    ( CHEERS )
Jon:  SO WE'RE NOT MOVING  ON. ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S PRETTY HARD HITTING. YOU KNOW THE MOST DAMNING LINE  IN THATTADE.
I'M BARACK OBAMA AND I  APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
Jon:  WHY? WHAT IS THE USE OF HAVING A  SUPERPAC IF THEY DON'T GIVE YOU  PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY. YOU'RE GOING WITH THE BIG BIRD  PIE, STILL? ( LAUGHTER )  YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN  NEXT?
THIS NEW AD THAT'S COME OUT  FROM THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN, LET ME  PLAY IT FOR YOU THIS MORNING. I'D LOVE YOUR REACTION, HERE IT  IS.
MITT ROMNEY TAKING ON OUR  ENEMIES, NO MATTER WHERE THEY  NEST.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THE  QUESTION IS, SENATOR, BUT I'M--  ( LAUGHTER )  I GUESS I AM JUST ASKING--
I DON'T, EITHER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  THAT AD ALLOWED  JOHN McCAIN, JOHN McCAIN  ALLOWED HIM TO LAUGH AT YOU. ( LAUGHTER )  TO LAUGH AT YOU FOR USING A  CARTOONISH, CHILD-LIKE FIGURE TO  INVIGORATE YOUR CAMPAIGN. THAT'S McCAIN WHO WAS SAYING  THAT.   ( APPLAUSE )   THAT'S GOT TO HURT. BUT HATERS GONNA HATE, RIGHT? HATER'S GONNA HATE, THE MEDIA,  THE REPUBLICANS. BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE STILL  FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT,  CHILDREN'S LITERACY.
OBAMA FOR AMERICA SAYS IT'S  REVIEWING A REQUEST FROM THE  SESAME WORKSHOP TO STOP AIRING  THE AD.
Jon:  OH! ET TU, BIG BIRD? I HAVE-- I MAY HAVE MIXED  LANGUAGES ON THAT. ALL RIGHT, SO LESSON LEARNED. MAYBE THIS WILL BE A WAKE-UP  CALL TO THE PRESIDENT. TO RECAPTURE SOME OF THAT VIGOR  AND ENTHUSIASM OF '08, WHEN A  PASSIONATE CANDIDATE AND  COMMITTED BASE OF SUPPORTERS,  ARTISTS. YESTERDAY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF  HEADED TO OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY  TO SPEAK TO THE YOUTH ONCE AGAIN  WITH WILL I AM IN. PERHAPS THIS WOULD BE THE MOMENT  TO UTLINE THE GRAND VISION IN  THE NIEWRT.
IT MAY SOUND SILLY, AND YOU  MAY LAUGH, BUT THIS IS THE THEME  SONG FROM MY CHILDHOOD AND I  WANT TO PLAY IS  ♪ SUNNY DAY  SWEEPING THE CLOUDS AWAY  ♪ ♪.
Jon:  LET IT GO! OH, MY GOD! WILL I AM PLAYED A SESAME STREET  SONG? AT LEAST HE DIDN'T HAVE HIM DO  SOME HALF-ASSED REMIX OF IT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT  BAC
