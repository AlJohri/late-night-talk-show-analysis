(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! FOR CENTURIES BRITISH JOURNALISM  WAS THE GOLD STANDARD OF  REPORTAGE. AUTHORITATIVE MEN TELLING YOU IN  CLIPPED ACCENTS ABOUT TRAIN  ROBBERIES, GERMAN BOMBS AND  RAIN. (LAUGHTER)  MOSTLY RAIN. (LAUGHTER)  BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE  GRAND TRADITION SUFFERED A BIT  OF A BLOW LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED BRITISH TABLOIDS HAVE  BEEN HACKING THE PHONES OF NOT  JUST HUGH GRANT BUT DEAD BRITISH SOLDIERS AND CHILD MURDER  VICTIMS. FOR BRITISH JOURNALISM IT WAS  REAL -- GOOGLY IN THE  COLLYWOBBLES. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT WAS RUPERT MURDOCH'S  DOING WHO IS, AS THE BRITS WOULD  SAY, AN AS (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  OH, THEY'RE -- OH, THERE'S A --  (APPLAUSE). THEIR WORD FOR THAT IS THE SAME  AS OURS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE  BRITISH MEDIA. THAT'S JUST MURDOCH STUFF. THE BRITISH MEDIA REMAINED  UNTARNISHED BY THAT TYPE OF  TAWDRY PHONE HACKING  UNPLEASANTNESS.
THE BBC IN CRISIS.
IT STARTED WITH JIMMY SAVILE.
HE WAS LIKE THE BRITISH  VERSION OF OUR DICK CLARK.
THE WILD EYED, WILD HAIR BUD  MUCH BELOVED BBC STAR NOW  DECEASED WHO POLICE BELIEVE MAY BE ONE OF BRITAIN'S WORST  PREDATORY SEX OFFENDERS EVER  WITH POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS OVER FOUR DECADES. THEY SAY SOME ABUSE MAY HAVE  HAPPENED ON BBC PROPERTY.
Jon: WAIT! THAT GUY? (LAUGHTER)  THAT CREEPY LOOKING DUDE WAS  BRITAIN'S DICK CLARK? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING! FIRST OF ALL, DICK CLARK DIDN'T  LOOK LIKE ROUTE TKPWER HAUER  PLAYING ONE OF THE CHILD CATCHERS FROM "CHITTY CHITTY  BANG BANG."  (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T WANT TO JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER BUT IF THIS FELLOW WAS  A BOOK I'M PRETTY SURE THE COVER  WOULD BE "DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH YOUR KIDS: THE JIMMY SAVILE  STORY."  WHAT DID THIS NOW KNOWN  PEDOPHILE HOST? WELL, IT WAS A HUGELY POPULAR  SHOW CALLED JIM "JIM EEL FIX IT"  WHERE CHILDREN WOULD WRITE IN AND HE WOULD GRANT THEIR WISHES. THEIR WISHES. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  HE WAS LIKE SANTA CLAUS. BUT REAL AND A PEDOPHILE. (LAUGHTER)  SO REALLY NOTHING LIKE SANTA  CLAUS. ALL RIGHT, THIS IS A HORRIFIC  STORY. BUT THE BBC WEREN'T THE ONLY  ONES WHO FAILED TO LOOK SO TOO  CLOSELY INTO JIMMY SAVILE'S  ACTIVITIES. HE RECEIVED A KNIGHT HOOD AND  NOT JUST FROM THE QUEEN BUT  ALSO-- AND THIS IS TRUE-- FROM THE POPE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  YEAH. I KNOW. THE VATICAN UNABLE TO DETECT --  (LAUGHTER). BOGGLES THE MIND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT THE BBC IS A 90-YEAR-OLD  BROADCASTING INSTITUTION. THEY'RE GOING TO HANDLE THIS. AS LONG AS THEY HANDLE IT  PROPERLY I THINK THEY CAN  WEATHER THE STORM.
BBC WAS WORKING ON AN  INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ON THIS BUT  DROPPED IT, SPARKING ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE BBC OF A COVERUP.
THE BBC AXED THIS DAMNING  REPORT FROM ITS NEWS NIGHT  PROGRAM INSTEAD AIRING A GROWING TRIBUTE TO JIMMY SAVILE THE DAY  AFTER CHRISTMAS. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: (LAUGHS)   THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT IS LIKE A  LIVING EMOTICON. (LAUGHTER)  LET ME RECAP THIS FOR A SECOND. HUH? A TOP BBC EMPLOYEE  SYSTEMATICALLY ABUSED CHILDREN  FOR DECADES WITH NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE COMPANY AT ANY POINT  GOING "HEY, WHAT'S ALL THIS  THEN?"  (LAUGHTER)  THEN WHEN THEY FINALLY INVESTIGATED, THE BBC NEWS FOUND  OUT-- ONLY A HALF CENTURY TOO  LATE-- IT (BLEEP) CANNED ITS OWN REPORT ON THE SEX OFFENDER AND  AIRED A TRIBUTE TO HIM INSTEAD. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  THIS IS ROCK BOTTOM, RIGHT? PLEASE TELL ME THIS DOES NOT GET  WORSE.
THINGS GOT EVEN WORSE WHEN  THE BBC'S FLAGSHIP PROGRAM "NEWS  NIGHT" AIRED A STORY WRONGLY IMPLICATING A FORMER POLITICIAN  OF SEXUAL ABUSE AT A CHILDREN'S  HOME.
Jon: HOLY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  ALTHOUGH, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, AT  LEAST SOMEONE GOT ACCUSED OF  PEDOPHILIA, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)  NOT THE RIGHT BUY BUT BABY  STEPS. I'VE GOT TO SAY ALL THAT THIS  MAKES MURDOCH PHONE TAPPING LOOK  ALMOST QUAINT. THERE'S NOT MANY TIMES WE GET TO  LOOK DOWN ON BRITAIN AND FEEL  SUPERIOR, WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO SATISFYING WHEN WE CAN. UNFORTUNATELY FOR US WE ARE  SEPARATED BY AN OCEAN FROM THE  CBS' SORDID, DISGUSTINGS ME.
AND THE REASON THIS IS  IMPORTANT FOR THE UNITED STATES  RIGHT NOW LIES AN INTERESTING STORY IS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF  BBC 50 DAYS AGO -- FORMER  DIRECTOR GENERAL, MARK THOMPSON WILL NOW NEXT WEEK TAKE OVER AS  THE HEAD OF THE "NEW YORK  TIMES."  (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: WHAT? SO THAT EXPLAIN THE "TIMES" NEW  SLOGAN "ALL THE NEWS THAT FITS  UNDER THE CARPET." (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
