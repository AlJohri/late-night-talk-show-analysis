Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A ROUGH SUMMER SO FAR. [BLEEPED]. WITH THE TERRIBLE VIOLENCE IN GAZA, THE CARNAGE IN UKRAINE. MEANWHILE, EVERYONE IN SYRIA'S LIKE, HELLO, ALSO BEING RELENTLESSLY BOMBED. MAKES YOU KIND OF NOSTALGIC FOR THE NEWS STORIES OF SUMMERS GONE BY.
THE ULTIMATE SUMMER NIGHTMARE, GREAT WHITE SHARK.
THE SUMMER OF THE SHARK.
SHARK ATTACKS.
THE SUMMER OF THE SHARK.
Jon: I MISS THOSE DAYS. NOTHING SAID SUMMER LIKE FIRING UP THE GRILL, MIXING SOME G AND T'S AND WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO BE MAULED BY FISH. YEAH, SHARKS ARE FISH. YOU WOULDN'T THINK THEY'RE FISH, BUT THEY'RE FISH, EVEN THOUGH THEY LACK A SWIM BLADDER. IT'S WHY THEY CONSTANTLY HAVE TO MOVE. THEY LACK A SWIM BLADDER. I STAY STILL IN THE WATER BECAUSE I WAS BORN WITH THREE SWIM BLADDERS, THREE. I'M BASICALLY NOTHING BUT SWIM BLADDER. [LAUGHTER] I REALLY, I HAVE A FEELING MY WIKIPEDIA PAGE JUST CHANGED. BUT SUMMER WASN'T JUST ABOUT SHARKS.
THIS MAY BE THE SUMMER OF SHARK SCARES, BUT ON ONE NEW HAMPSHIRE BEACH, THE SCARE CAME FROM A MENACING BALD EAGLE.
WHAT KIND OF A MENACE ARE SHARKS AND ALLIGATORS.
CHILLING TALES OF KILLER MOSQUITOES.
Jon: CALL THE SCI-FI NETWORK. PITCH SHAR-QUITO-GATOR. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A NEW SPECIES ON THE ENDANGERED LIST -- MAN. [LAUGHTER] [MENACING MUSIC PLAYING] WITH MULTIPLE SWIM BLADDERS. LOOK, I KNOW, I KNOW THOSE YEARS. I KNOW THOSE YEARS ALSO FEATURED THE NON-SCARE PREDATORY ANIMAL BASED STORIES, BUT SUMMER NEWS, MAN, IT WAS BALANCED, LIKE TAKE LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, SURE, WE MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE WE ARE LIVING IN A DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS WATCHING AND LISTENING AND STORING EVERYTHING YOU DO, BUT WE WASHED IT DOWN WITH A LITTLE DELICIOUS RACISM AND GRAVY. AND A POLITICAL SEX SCANDAL THAT SPAWNED AN INTERNATIONAL DANCE CRAZE. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I MISS THAT GUY. THE GUY, THE GUY IN THE BLUE SHIRT, NOT THE OTHER GUY. THE OTHER GUY I DON'T MISS SO MUCH, BUT THE BLUE SHIRT, THE OLIVER GUY, THE ENGLISH GUY, I MISS THAT GUY. HE WAS MY FRIEND. [AUDIENCE REACTS] THE HEAT HAS MUSHED YOUR BRAINS. WHERE'S THIS YEAR'S FRESH SECRET IDENTITY CELEBRITY DICK PIC? WAIT. SECRET IDENTITY CELEBRITY DICK PIC. THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER GREAT SHOW TO PITCH TO... WHAT'S THAT? OH, BRAVO'S ALREADY MAKING IT. ALL RIGHT. ISN'T ANYTHING INNOCUOUS THREATENING OUR SHORES THIS SUMMER?
BEACH-GOER SHOT THIS VIDEO OF A SHARK. YOU CAN SEE IT WIGGLING THERE AS IT MOVES UP TO SHORE.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NOW WE'RE, NOW WE'RE INTO IT. NOW WE GOT SOMETHING. DAHH-DA, DAHH-DA, DAHH-DA.
UNFORTUNATELY THE SHARK WAS CHOKING ON A SEA LION BECAUSE THE SHARK DIED A SHORT TIME LATER. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: CAN'T CATCH A BREAK. THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN SO DEPRESSING THE SHARKS ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT NOTHING IN THE SHARK DEPARTMENT, BUT COME ON, MAN. WE HAVE NOTHING BUT DEPRESSING NEWS TO COVER. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME OTHER OLD, RELIABLE, PROVIDER OF CRAZY.
SHE'S BACK, Y'ALL, PAULA DEEN.
Jon: OH, THIS SHOULD BE GOOD. WHAT'S SHE DOING NOW, OPENING UP A NEW RESTAURANT, A TGI BLACK FACE? I KNOW.
PAULA DEEN MAKING A COMEBACK, LAUNCHING HER OWN CHANNEL ONLINE.
GUESS WHO'S GONE DIGITAL, Y'ALL? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU KNOW, JUST LICKING BUTTER OFF YOUR FINGERS ISN'T GOING DIGITAL, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? SO THAT WAS NOTHING, NOTHING ALBEIT WITH A SIDE OF FRIES, BUT COME ON. THIS IS IN AMERICA. HOW ARE WE IN A STUPID STORY DROUGHT? WE HAVE SUCH ABUNDANT NATURAL RESERVES OF CRAZY. HIT ME, HIT ME HARD.
WELL, SARAH PALIN WENT A LITTLE ROGUE ON AN ALASKA ROADWAY LAST WEEK.
Jon: PLEASE. PLEASE TELL ME SHE WAS CAUGHT DRUNK RIDING ON MOOSEBACK.
THE FORMER GOVERNOR WAS PULLED OVER FOR SPEEDING IN HER HOMETOWN OF WASILLA. SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT IT. SHE JOKED, "I WASN'T SPEEDING. I WAS QUALIFYING FOR NASCAR." [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S NOT A SCANDAL. THAT WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD JOKE. SON OF A BITCH. WE'RE DOOMED. SOMEBODY GET ME A SEA LION TO CHOKE ON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
