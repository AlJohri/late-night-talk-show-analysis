Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ASSOCIATE  PROFESSOR OF AERONAUTICS AND AFT  TROA NAUGHTICS AT D ASTRONAUTICS YOU CAN CATCH HER ON RISE OF  DRONE.
THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  CALLS THEM REMOTELY PILOTED  AIRCRAFT BUT MOST PEOPLE KNOW THEM AS DRONES. NO LONGER JUST EYES IN THE SKY,  THEY ARE TAKE THE PILOT OUT OF  COCKPIT AND REVOLUTIONIZING WARFARE BY ALLOWING US TO SEE  AND KILL FROM HALF A WORLD AWAY.
WE CAN EASILY MAKE OUT PEOPLE  FROM FIVE, SIX MILES AWAY.
YOU CAN PUT WEAPONS THROUGH A  WINDOW-SIZED OPENING WITH EASE.
Jon: I'M GOING TO SHUT MY  WINDOW. [ LAUGHTER ] PLEASE WELCOME MISSY CUMMINGS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M GOOD. THANK YOU.
Jon: SO THIS IS THE  TECHNOLOGY -- THE TECHNOLOGY OF  THIS IS SO -- EVEN THE RISE OF DRONES HAS SUCH A SCI-FI KIND OF  VIBE TO IT. THERE'S ALWAYS THAT SENSE  WHENEVER THE UNITED STATES MAKES  A SORT OF JUMP IN KIND OF WARFARE WE CELEBRATE IT AND  REALIZE SEVEN GOING TO HAVE ONE  OF THESE IN FIVE YEARS SOX THAT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OF THOSE  WORKING ON THIS TYPE OF  TECHNOLOGY.
YOU COULD DO ON A WEB SITE TO  DO IT YOURSELF DRONES AND BUILD  IT YOURSELF.
Jon: I WOULD NOT TELL THAT  TO ME. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE A HOME  PROJECT?
OR IF YOU GO TO BROOKSTONE OR  AMAZON AND BUY ONE ONLINE.
Jon: WITH A HELL-FIRE  SNIFFLE.
NOT QUITE THOSE ARE A LITTLE  BIT MORE.
Jon: THE TECHNOLOGY IS  SIMPLE.
WE CALL THEM UNMANNED AERIAL  VEHICLES BECAUSE THE WORD DRONE  TAKES ON A STUPIDNESS. THEY ARE GETTING SMARTER. THEY ARE SIM AIRCRAFT. THAT'S ONE OF REASONS THEY ARE  SO POPULAR BECAUSE THEY ARE  CHEAPER TO BUILD AND A LOT CHEAPER TO FLY AND MAINTAIN. YOU DON'T NEED AN EXPENSIVE  PILOT THAT COSTS MILLIONS TO  TRAIN.
Jon: DOESN'T TAKE AWAY ANY  ADVANTAGE THAT THE UNITED STATES  HAS. IF WE HAVE ADVANTAGE IT'S THAT  WE LIKE TO SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT  OF MONEY ON DEFENSE. THE ONLY ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS  LIKE YOU'VE GOT ONE TANK, WE'VE  GOT A MILLION.
SO WE'RE JUST BUILDING MORE  DRONES.
Jon: MORE DRONES?
YES.
Jon: IS THERE -- YOU KNOW,  TECHNOLOGY HAS IN SOME WAYS  DEMOCRATIZED PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO DO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF  DAMAGE. IF YOU CAN CHEAPLY MAKE A DRONE  AND ARM IT WITH A MISSILE,  THINGS THAT ONLY A COUNTRY COULD DO BEFORE COULD BE DONE BY  INDIVIDUAL GROUPS. NOT TOP ONLY DISCUSS THE  DYSTOPIAN DIVISION OF DRONES, IS  THERE A DIVISION OF YOUR OFFICE THAT WORKS ONLY ON THE PERVERTED  USE OF THAT?
EVERY TECHNOLOGY CAN BE  PERVERTED IN SOME WAY. BUT I THINK ONE OF AREAS PEOPLE  DON'T THINK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK  ABOUT DRONES IS THE COMMERCIAL  APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN FIVE OR TEN  YEARS, I THINK YOU'LL SEE  FED-EX, UPS UNMANNED AIRCRAFTS FLYING OUR PACKAGES AROUND.
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE  GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION  OF FED-EX AND UPS. JUST BOOM! OPEN WINDOW. HERE IS YOUR PACKAGE! [ LAUGHTER ] IS THERE A CONCERN -- YOU KNOW,  THAT THE EASE OF IT ALLOWS THE  GOVERNMENT TO MERE EISLEY OVERSTEP -- EASILY TO OVERSTEP  OR AUTHORITY -- IS IT EASIER TO  LOSE SIGHT OF THE KILLING POWER GIVEN THE DISTANCE YOU HAVE FROM  IT?
WE'VE BEEN BACKING UP WARFARE  OUT OF BATTLEFIELD FOR MANY,  MANY YEARS FROM HIGH ALTITUDE BOMBING, BALLISTIC MISSILES. SO FLYING DRONES IS GETTING US  FURTHER FROM THE TARGET BUT  THAT'S A LONG TREND. I THINK THE MILITARY DOES A  FANTASTIC JOB OF HAVING THE  REGULATIONS IN PLACE AND DISCUSSING IT. THERE'S AN ENTIRE CONFERENCE,  FOR EXAMPLE, OF MILITARY ETHICS  THAT DOES NOTHING BUT DISCUSS UNMANNED VEHICLES OR WARFARE.
Jon: CAN WE GO TO THAT ONE?
SURE IT'S RIVETING. THERE'S A DANGER FOR SMALL  COUNTRIES BECAUSE THE BARRIER  TOP ENTRY IS SO LOW. ANYONE CAN GO TO  DOITYOURSELFDRONES AND FIND THE  TECHNOLOGY. IT COULD BE ANTHRAX, FOR  EXAMPLE. IT'S A REAL CONCERN AND  GOVERNMENT IS WORKING ON HOW TO  DEFEND AGAINST THESE KIND AFTER  TACKS.
Jon: YOU GET THE SENSE THAT  WHATEVER PEOPLE CAN MAKE YOU CAN  BE SURE THEY'LL USE IT FOR SOMEWHAT OF AN ANEFARIOUS EVEN  ATOMIC ENERGY. IS THAT A MORAL CONCERN?
I THINK SO. I USED TO FLY F-18 FOR THE NAVY,  FLYING IT TEN YEARS AGO WAS  DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT WAS ME TALKING TO ONE OTHER PERSON ON  THE RADIO MAKING THE DECISIONS  UNDER STRESS OVER A TARGET. TODAY WE HAVE DRONES AND OTHER  PEOPLE ON THE GROUND AND THEY  ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER. THEY ARE TALKING TO THE AIR  TRAFFIC CONTROL PLANE IN THE  SKY. THEY ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE AT  THE PENTAGON, FOR EXAMPLE, SO  WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE PEOPLE TALKING IN REAL-TIME. SO I THINK DRONE WARFARE IS SAY  SAFER, MORE EFFECTIVE FORM OF  WARFARE. LESS COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND PRESS  BLUE ON BLUE KILLS WHICH IS WHEN  WE KILL OUR OWN PEOPLE.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT A DEATH  STAR?
I SIGNED THAT PETITION.
Jon: DID YOU REALLY? WHY DIDN'T YOU SIGN THAT  PETITION? [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU  SAY IT'S SORT OF AN EASIER  TECHNOLOGY, IS THAT THE KIND OF THING WHERE -- YOU KNOW, I  ALWAYS -- LISTEN, I WATCH A LOT  OF MOVIES. ANYTHING LIKE THE CLONE ARMIES,  DRONES -- ALL THOSE TYPES OF  THINGS. YOU SEE 30 YEARS FROM NOW THERE  MAY BE ROBOTIC WARFARE WHERE  THERE ARE, YOU KNOW KILLING FIELDS OF ROBOTS THAT ARE JUST  KIND OF AT EACH OTHER.
SURE DARFA.
Jon: WHO IS THAT?
DEFENSE --
Jon: OH, YEAH, YEAH.
YEAH SO THEY'VE GOT WORK  GOING ON RIGHT NOW TO DO THAT. I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT  OF WORK GOING ON INSIDE THE  MILITARY AND OUTSIDE THE MILITARY TO COMMERCIALIZE THESE  BUT EVEN TO DO HUMANITARIAN AID. I'M WORKING WITH THE NAVY ON A  HELICOPTER THAT COULD BE CALLED  IN BY SOMEBODY ON DISTRESS. YOU CALL IT FROM THE SMART PHONE  IT FINDS YOU AND LANDS AND CAN  DO AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION. NO HUMAN PILOT INVOLVED.
Jon: CAN YOU DO THAT WITH  TAXIS?
I THINK GOING IS ON THAT.
Jon: CAN YOU TAKE AROUND A  COUPLE MINUTES?
SURE.
Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLE  BIT MORE. YOU CAN WATCH NOVA'S RISE OF THE  DRONES ON PBS THIS WEEK. YOU CAN CATCH IT ON THE NOVA WEB  SITE. MISSING
