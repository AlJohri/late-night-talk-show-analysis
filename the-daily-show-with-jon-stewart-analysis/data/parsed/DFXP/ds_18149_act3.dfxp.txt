Jon: WE'RE BACK WITH MY GUEST TONIGHT, A PULITZER WINNING PRIZE REPORTER, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED EMPTY MANSIONS: THE MYSTERIOUS LIFE OF HUGUETTE CLARK AND THE SPENDING OF A GREAT AMERICAN FORTUNE. BILL DEDMAN. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INCREDIBLE STORIES THAT IS RIGHT UNDERNEATH SORT OF LITERALLY THE NOSE OF NEW YORKERS, BUT NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA ABOUT THIS. HOW DID YOU FIND HUGUETTE CLARK AND THIS STORY.
I WAS SHOPPING FOR A HOUSE FOR MY FAMILY, AND I GOT A LITTLE OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE. HER HOUSE IN CONNECTICUT WAS FOR SALE FOR $24 MILLION, MARKED DOWN FROM $35 MILLION. I WAS LOOKING UP WHO OWNED WHICH HOUSES AT THE TOP OF THE CHARTS. AND I DIDN'T KNOW HER NAME. HUGUETTE CLARK, THAT MEANT NOTHING TO ME. SO I WAS LOOKING UP THE ADDRESS ON THE TOWN WEBSITE. I'M A PUBLIC RECORDS GUY AND I WAS READING THE ZONING RECORDS -- I KNOW YOU DO THAT ALL OF THE TIME.
Jon: OH, ALL THE TIME. I READ THEM TO MY CHILDREN BEFORE BED.
THAT WOULD WORK. AND HER ATTORNEY HAD TOLD THE TOWN, THIS HOUSE HAS NOT BEEN LIVED IN SINCE THIS OWNER BOUGHT IT IN 1951. SO I GO OVER TO SEE THE CARETAKER, AND HE ASKED ME, DO YOU THINK MAYBE SHE HAS BEEN DEAD ALL THESE YEARS? SO IT TURNED OUT SHE HAD A NICER HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA, ABOUT $85 MILLION TO $100 MILLION OVER THE PACIFIC IN SANTA BARBARA. AND SHE HADN'T BEEN THERE SINCE 1951. SO SHE HAD THREE APARTMENTS ON FIFTH AVENUE. SO I TALKED TO BORIS, THE DOOR MAN, BORIS THE DOOR MAN, AND HE SAID, NO, IT'S BEEN 22 YEARS AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER. SO WE HAD TO FIND HER.
Jon: AND WHERE WAS SHE?
SHE LIVED IN A HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK. HERE SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A U.S. SENATOR WHO WAS BORN -- HE WAS 22 WHEN THE CIVIL WAR BEGAN, AND HIS DAUGHTER WAS ALIVE DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, LIVING IN A HOSPITAL FOR 7,400 NIGHTS. SHE LIVED FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS IN BETH ISRAEL HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK CITY. PERFECTLY HEALTHY. SHE HAD SOME FACIAL CANCER. SHE HAD GONE IN AND SHE FELT BETTER, AND THEY CHARGED HER ABOUT $400,000 A YEAR TO LIVE THERE.
Jon: SO A NORMAL RENT?
EXACTLY. SO SHE STAYED.
Jon: WHAT IS INCREDIBLE TO ME IS THIS WOMAN IS SORT OF -- WAS A LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THIS ERA OF AMERICAN DOMINANCE. DO YOU KNOW A MAN CALLED HORSE --
DUSTIN HOFFMAN?
Jon: YES. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY. SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE TO GO TO EUROPE ON THE RETURN TRIP OF THE TITANIC.
MY CO-AUTHOR IS HER COUSIN, AND HE HAD SPOKEN TO HER ON THE PHONE. HE WAS A LITTLE BETTER A REPORTER THAN I HE LOOKED HER UP IN THE PHONE DIRECTORY. THIS HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME. BUT HE SPOKE TO HER OFF AND ON THE PHONE FOR NINE YEARS. AND SHE DESCRIBED HOW NO, WE COULDN'T GO ON THE TITANIC. OUR FATHER SHOWED WHERE WE WOULD BE SLEEPING, BUT IT SANK. SO WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GO ON THE RETURN TRIP.
Jon: LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENTS IN LIFE. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. APPARENTLY SHE WAS INCREDIBLY LUCID AND SWEET AS PIE.
SHE WAS. CUTE AS PIE AND SWEET. SHE WAS VERY GENEROUS. SHE SURPRISED SOMEONE WHO NEVER MET HER WITH A $30,000 GIFT. SHE PAID $200,000 A YEAR FOR THE NURSING CARE OF THE DAUGHTER OF HER NANNY FROM WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD. SHE WAS VERY INTO DOLLS. SHE COLLECTED DOLLS AND BUILT DOLL HOUSES AND DESIGNED LITTLE JAPANESE CASTLES. SHE WAS AN ARTIST. SHE PAINTED. THE MAN AND WOMAN WHO FIXED HER DOLL HOUSES AND DID THE CURTAINS FOR THEM WERE PESTERED TO DEATH BY HER. SHE WOULD CALL EVERY EVENING AND SAY THE CEILINGS WERE TOO LOW IN THE DOLL HOUSES AND SHE TOLD THEM THE LITTLE PEOPLE ARE BANGING THEIR HEADS.
Jon: SURE.
BUT I MENTIONED SHE WAS LUCID. SHE WAS VERY GENEROUS TO THEM. SHE WOULD GIVE THEM $30,000, $50,000, A LITTLE GIFT SHE WOULD SAY. ALL OF THE GRANDCHILDREN OF THE COUPLE WHO MADE HER DOLL HOUSES WENT TO COLLEGE ON HER GENEROSITY.
Jon: I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT DOLL HOUSE CONSTRUCTION WAS RUN BY THE MOB. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A BIG BUSINESS. ONE OF THE DARK TURNS IN THE BOOK IS THE WAY THAT THE HOSPITALS THAT SHE STAYED AT TRIED OVERTLY AND EXPLICITLY AND WITH A PAPER TRAIL TO GET MONEY FROM HER.
THEY DESCRIBED HER IN THEIR E-MAILS AS THE BIGGEST BUCKS CONTRIBUTING POTENTIAL WE EVER HAD. THE HOSPITAL PRESIDENT -- THIS HAS PROBABLY BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE HOSPITAL -- THE HOSPITAL PRESIDENT VISITED HER FREQUENTLY, AND HIS MOTHER CAME TO VISIT TO WATCH CARTOONS WITH HER ON TV. SHE LIKED THE JETSONS AND FLINTSTONES, WHICH I UNDERSTAND, BUT THE SMURFS, I CAN'T QUITE CONNECT TO.
Jon: NOBODY CAN.
BUT THEY WOULD SIT THERE AND TRY TO MAKE A BOND WITH HER. ULTIMATELY, THEY WERE GOING TO TEAR DOWN THE BUILDING, AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOSPITAL CAME TO HER AND SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE US $125 MILLION, WE WON'T HAVE TO SELL THIS BUILDING. SHE COULD HAVE AFFORDED IT. SHE HAD STOCK. SHE COULD HAVE PAID THAT. AND SHE TOLD THEM, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND SHE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENT. THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR $125 MILLION. IN THE WILL -- THEY GOT A PAINTING, A MANET PAINTING. THREE AND A HALF MILLION. BUT IN THE WILL, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY DISAPPOINTED. THEY GOT ONLY ONE OF HER 300 MILLION.
Jon: THE WORST THING IN THE BOOK IS AN E-MAIL FROM THE GUY WHO SAYS SHE GAVE US MONEY, BUT IT WAS RELATIVELY MODEST. LIKE A MILLION. DISAPPOINTED.
DISAPPOINTED.
Jon: IT IS ONE OF THOSE INCREDIBLE STORIES YOU DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED. IT FILLED THE VOID. NICELY FILLED. "EMPTY MANSIONS," IT IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. IT'S ONLY A MILLION DOLLARS. BILL DEDMAN.
