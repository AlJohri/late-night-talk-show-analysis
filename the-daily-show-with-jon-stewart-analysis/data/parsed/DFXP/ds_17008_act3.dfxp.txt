Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A SENIOR EDITOR FOR NATIONAL REVOW, HE'S ALSO A HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED JAMES MADISON, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM RICHARD BROOKHISER, SIR. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. FIRST OF ALL, THE BOOK IS CALLED JAMES MADISON. THANK YOU FOR WRITING A BOOK AND SHOWING ONCE AGAIN THAT THE ALTITUDE NALLY CHALLENGED AMONG US CAN  STILL BE SUCCESS. JAMES MADISON, PEOPLE DON'T ROLIZE THIS, 8 INCHES TALL.
5, 6.
Jon: WAS HE 5, 6. THAT IS EVEN MORE GENEROUS. I THOUGHT HE WAS 5,.
THEY TELL ME IN MONTPELIER WHICH IS HIS HOME WHICH IS NOW A NATIONAL SITE, THAT HE WAS 5, 6. I JUST HAD AN E-MAIL EXCHANGE ON THIS YESTERDAY.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT, SHORT PEOPLE CAN NEVER GIVE IT UP. EVEN IN DEATH, THEY ARE STILL LIKE I'M SURE MADISON IS IN HIS GRAVE LIKE 5, 6.
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE COMES AFTER THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WAS OVER 6 FEET.
Jon: ALL THOSE GUY, WASHINGTON WAS A BIG DUDE. ALL THESE GUYS. MADISON IS SUCH AN INTERESTING FIGURE BECAUSE IN MY MIND I ALWAYS ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THE  FEDERALIST PAPERS AND WITH --
ONE OF THE CO-AUTHORS.
Jon: RIGHT. AND WITH CREATING ALMOST THE SENSE AND THEORY OF OUR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT BUT ONCE  HAMILTON GOT HIS FINGERS IN THERE, MADISON REALLY BACKED AWAY FROM THAT.
HE BACKED AWAY. HAMILTON HAS AN ECONOMIC PLAN WHICH APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T DISCUSS WHEN WHEN  THEY WERE DOING THE FEDERALIST PAPERS AND ONCE HAMILTON STARTS PRESIDENTING THAT INTO WORK, MADISON  DOESN'T LIKE IT.
Jon: THIS IS THE CENTRAL BANK.
THE CENTRAL BANK, HAMILTON WAS A MERCHANT'S CLERK IN THE WEST ENDIES. MADISON IS A VIRGINIA PLANTER. SO THEY COME FROM TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS AND THEY SEE IT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. AND MADISON IS JUST VERY SUSPICIOUS. AND HE DOESN'T LIKE IT. SO BUT WHAT INTERESTED ME IN THIS BOOK IS WHAT MADISON THEN DID ABOUT IT ONCE HE  SEES HAMILTON GOING OFF IN WHAT HE THINKS IS THE WRONG DIRECTION.
Jon: RIGHT. AND HE THINKS THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. MADISON FEELS THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO.
YES, THIS IS NOT AN ENUMERATED POWER. HAMILTON SAYS WELL, A IT ALLOWS THE UNITED STATES TO RAISE LOANS ON THE CREDIT OF  THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS AN I ENUMERATE POD WE ARE.
Jon: REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD GOOD CREDIT? THOSE WERE THE DAYS.
WE COULD USE SOME OF THAT AGAIN. BUT SO WHAT MADISON DOES IS HE INVENTS THE FIRST NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTY TO OPPOSE HAMILTON. AND HE-- THE FIRST STEP HE TAKES, HE AND HIS BEST FRIEND THOMAS JEFFERSON, HIS  EIGHT YEARS OLDER BEST, BEST FRIEND, THEY TAKE A VACATION IN THE SUMMER OF 171. THEY LEAVE PHILADELPHIA, THE CAPITAL TO GO TO NEW YORK CITY, AND THEY GO UP THE  HUDSON TO LAKE GEORGE AND LAKE CHAMPLAIN, AND THEIR THEY'RE CANOEING, FISHING, AND THEN THEY COME BACK TO NEW ENGLAND, TO NEW YORK, AND THEY GO BACK. BUT THERE'S A LAWYER IN NEW YORK CITY WHO'S A GOOD FRIEND OF HAMILTONS AND HE  WRITES HIM A LETTER IN PHILADELPHIA AND SAYS THERE'S A PASSIONATE COURTSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN. AND ENEMIES OF YOURS IN NEW YORK STATE. SO THEY'RE COLLECTING POLITICAL ALLIES. IN ANOTHER STATE.
Jon: THAT IS THE BEST ROAD TRIP MOVIE I COULD EVER IMAGINE. I IMAGINE THEM IN LIKE A CONVERTIBLE AND THEN YOU HERE LIKE, I FEEL GOOD,nd  THEN THEY'RE LIKE DRIVING. HOW DO THEY-- IS THEIR GOAL AT THIS POINT TO CREATE THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM OR IS THEIR  GOAL MERELY TO TAKE SOME OF THE WIND OUT OF THE, I GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL THEM NOW  THE FEDERALLISTS' SAIL SAILS.
WELL, YOU KNOW, THEY SORT OF EDGE INTO THIS, BECAUSE WHEN THE FOUNDERS PUT THE  CONSTITUTION INTO OPERATION, THEY DON'T THINK OF PARTIES. AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF THEY THINK THERE WON'T BE ANY PARTIES. SO THEY'RE KIND OF SIDE ELLING INTO IT. BUT MADISON IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO BREAK OUT OF THAT CA COCOON. AND HE IS THE ONE THAT COUNTRIES ENS THIS NEW PARTY. HE CALLS IT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN 1792. AND THAT'S THE NAME IT HAS FOR 0 YEARS. AND THEN IT BECOMES THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IT NOW IS.
Jon: AND THE FEDERALISTS THEN BECOME THE WIGS OR WHOEVER.
RIGHT. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT MAD SOP TOO, SO HAMILTON FORMS THIS BANK AND MADISON  THINKS IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT IT LASTS FOR 20 YEARS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: AND HE BECOMES PRESIDENT AND DECIDES, YOU KNOW WHAT, BECAUSE IT LASTS  20 YEARS, I GUESS IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS WHEN HE'S IN HIS RETIREMENT, YOU KNOW. SOMEONE ASKS HEM WHY DID YOU SUPPORT THE RECHARTER OF THE FIRST BANK OF THE UNITED STATES. AND HE SAYS WELL THE FACT THAT ITS WITH FOR 20 YEARS AN UNDER BOTH PARTIES, YOU  KNOW, THE FEDERALISTS WHO SET IT UP AND THEN WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CAME IN,%  JEFFERSON, THEN MADISON, AND NO ONE TRIED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND THAT SIGNIFIED THE  NATION'S JUDGEMENT OF ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY. NOW HE IS SLICING THIS VERY FINE. I MEAN HE'S NOT QUITE SAYING I WAS WRONG IN 1791. HE'S LEAVING OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT, WELL, MAYBE, MAYBE I WAS RIGHT BUT THEN HE'S ALSO ADMITTING EVERYBODY ELSE MADE A  DIFFERENT DECISION SO NOW I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH THAT.
Jon: IT'S FASCINATING. YOU YOU READ IT. I LOVE ABOUT THESE BOOKS, IT BRINGS TO LIFE THE CHAOTIC. WE ALL SORT OF SOLIDIFIED WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR MINDS BUT IT'S MUCH MORE CAY OT  ECK AND MUCH MORE COMPLEX.
CHAOTIC AMBITIOUS. YOU TALK ABOUT POLITICS NOW, IF THEY ALL CAME BACK, THEY WOULD SAY YOU CLEANED IT UP.
Jon: YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT. SO CIVIL.
IT'S NOT AS CRAZY, YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE HONEST. YOU'VE GOT NONPARTISAN JOURNALISM. I MEAN THEY WOULD BE AMAZED. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE CRAZINESS AND VICIOUSNESS, THE 1790s AND EARLY 1800s.
Jon: OH, I WANT TO SEE IT. JAMES MADISON, THE BOOK, A GREAT READ. RICHARD BROOKHISER, THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
