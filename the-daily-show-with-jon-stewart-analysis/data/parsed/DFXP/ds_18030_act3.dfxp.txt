JDZ WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT IS A STAFF WRITING  AT THE NEW WORKER. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED  DOGFIGHT. 2012 PRESIDENTATE CAMPAIGN  IN VERSE PLEASE WELCOME BACK  TO THE PROGRAM CALVIN  TRILLIN, SIR. MR. TRILLIN ALWAYS A DELIGHT  TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
THANK YOU, YOU'RE LOOKING  WELL.
THANK YOU.
I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING  ABOUT THIS BOOK.
GO AHEAD, SAY AS MUCH AS  YOU CAN POSSIBLY SAY.
I HAVE MANY AUTHORS ON  THE PROGRAM, MANY ESTEEMED  PULITZER PRIZE WINNER, PEOPLE OF GREAT RENOWN.
RIGHT.
Jon: THEIR BOOKS ARE  THICK. VERY HEAVY. AND THEY CAUSE ME GREAT  TROUBLE DURING THE DAY  GETTING THROUGH THEM. YOURS, SIR, IS A BREATH OF  FRESH AIR.
THAT'S THE NICEST  COMPLIMENT I'VE HAD SINCE I  DID A BOOK OF COLUMNS AND A FRIEND OF MINE IN FLORIDA  SAID THEY WERE JUST THE  RIGHT LENGTH TO WAIT OUT ONE  OF THOSE DRAWBRIDGES. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. EVERY AUTHOR LOOKS FOR THAT  SORT OF COMPLIMENT.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY, HERE IS  WHAT ELSE IT DOES. IT BOLDLY PREDICTS AN  ELECTION, LOOK, CAN WE GET A  SHOT OF THE COVER. OKAY, OBAMA IS SMILING,  ROMNEY IS NOT SMILING. BIDEN IS INCREDIBLY SMILING,  PAUL RYAN HAS JUST BEEN  NEUTERED. SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  (APPLAUSE)  WAS THERE ALTERNATE ARTWORK  FOR THIS IF THE ELECTION HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT. I AM AN OLDER NATE SILVER.
Jon: DON'T, YOU BARELY, I  THOUGHT, YOU COULD BE  BROTHERS. I'VE JUST CROSSED THE AARP  THRESHOLD.
YOU WILL GET MORE MAIL  THAN I USED TO GET.
Jon: I DO. I GOT THE CARD BUT IT  DOESN'T SAY THAT I GET-- I  DONE THINK I GET OFF AT  MOVIES YET OR BUSES. I THINK IT'S JUST THE CARD.
IT IS JUST THE CARD, JON.
Jon: WHEN DOES THE OTHER  STUFF KICK IN.
I WOON KNOW THIS BUT I'VE  BEEN TOLD THAT AT 65, AT 65  YOU CAN GET WHAT SUBWAY, WHAT I CALL A DECEMBERER  PASS.
Jon: AND YOU GET TO GO.
IT'S NOT FREE BUT IT'S  HALF PRICE. AND SO RIGHT NOW COY JUST  LEAVE THERE STUDIO, GET ON A  TRAIN AND GO TO THE BRONX FOR ABOUT $1.12.
Jon: WELL WORTH IT AT  WHAT POINT --
IF YOU WANT TO GO TO THE  BRONX.
Jon: I HAVE UNDERSTOOD  THAT AT A CERTAIN AGE ARE  YOU ALLOWED TO MAKE RACIST COMMENTS WITH THE AARP CARD  AND NOT BE PENALIZED IN  ANYWAY.
YOU KNOW HIM, HE'S SET IN  HIS WAYS.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT, YOU  JUST GETS TO SHOW THE CARD. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: TELL ME ABOUT THIS  ELECTION. WAS IT DIFFICULT TO WRITE  YOUR VERSE FOR THIS  ELECTION? WAS IT A PROCESS? WHERE DID THE INSPIRATION --
I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED  BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE  PRIMARY FIGHT WITH THE  REPUBLICANS. AND THE LAST TIME I DID THIS  I HAD TWO. BUT THE FIELD WAS SO  COLOURFUL, AS YOU WELL KNOW.
THE REPUBLICAN FIELD.
THE REPUBLICAN FIELD. THERE IS ACTUALLY A POEM IN  THERE CALLED THE LAMENTATION  OF THE LATE NIGHT COMICS WHEN I THINK IT WAS WHEN  HERRMANN KANE LEFT.
I REMEMBER THAT PAIN LIKE  IT WAS YESTERDAY.
HI YOU CRYING AND A LOT  OF PEOPLE WEEPING. THE LAST LINE IS COULD WE  HAVE TRUMPED THAT --
OH, WE NOT BE THE  GREATEST GIFT TO LATE-NIGHT  TELEVISION. A GROWN MAN THAT HAS TO PUT  HIS NAME ON EVERYTHING HE  OWNS.
BUT IF TRUMP HAD BECOME  PRESIDENT, WELL, YOU KNOW, I  ALWAYS SAY THAT PEOPLE IN THE SMALL JOKE TRADE THAT WE  TREAT THINGS-- YOU ARE.
Jon: NO, NO, IT SOUNDS  LIKE A MOVIE THAT BARRY  LEFFINSON WOULD DIRECT ABOUT GUYS IN BALTIMORE WHO ARE IN  THE SMALL JOKE TRADE.
WELL, WHAT I CAN SAY. I THINK THAT WE THINK OF  SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH  MIGHT NOT BE THAT GOOD FOR  THE COUNTRY.
Jon: SURE.
THE WAY DENTISTS THINK  ABOUT TOOTH DECAY. IT'S A PITTY BUT WHERE WOULD  BUSINESS BE WITHOUT IT.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY  RIGHT.
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED. DUE KNOW HOW TRIDENT HAD  THAT COMMERCIAL WHERE THEY  WOULD SAY FOUR OUT OF FIVE  DENTISTS RECOMMEND SUGARLESS  GUM. SO 20% OF DENTISTS WOULD BE  LIKE SURE, SUGAR, WHY NOT IT  DOES SEEM LIKE THEIR GOAL WAS YEAH, YEAH, THAT WILL BE  GOOD.
THAT'S THE 20%.
Jon: SO YOU SEE US AS  KINDRED SPIRITS WHO ARE THE  20% DENTIST CROWD.
WE'RE TO GO AHEAD AND  HAVE AS MUCH SUGAR AS YOU  WANT, CROWD, YEAH.
Jon: WAS THERE A  PARTICULAR CANDIDATE IN THIS  FIELD THAT GAVE YOU THE  GREATEST JOY TO WRITE ABOUT?
I LIKE PERRY.
Jon: SURE, SURE.
YOU LIKED PERRY TOO.
Jon: OH, SO MUCH.
AND IT WAS A GOOD RHYME,  YOU KNOW, I AM INTERESTED IN  RHYME. AND HE HAD GREAT HAIR.
Jon: YEAH.
AND THEN PERRY RHYMED  WITH BENEATH THE HAIR THE  SPACE WAS AIRY.
Jon: NICE. NOW ROMNEY IT TOUGH -- IF  ROMNEY WAS PRESIDENT THERE  IS NOT A LOT THAT RHYMES  WITH ROMNEY.
NO, THERE ISN'T. AND I WAS THINKING IN THE  LAST FEW DAYS HOW LUCKY I  WAS THAT WHEN HE WAS BORN  AND HIS NAME WILLARD MITT ROMNEY, THAT HIS PARENTS  DIDN'T SAY WELL LET'S JUST  CALL HIM WILLARD, WILLARD  DOESN'T RHYME WITH ANYTHING. BUT M ITT IS OKAY. AND FORTUNATELY A LOT OF  THEM HAD THOSE KIND OF NICK  NAME, NEWT, THERE IS A  LITTLE PROCEEDS IN THE BOOK THAT IS CALLED THE TITLE IS  CALISTA GINGRICH, AWARE THAT  HER HUSBAND HAS CHEATED ON AND THEN LEFT TWO WOMEN WITH  SERIOUS ILLNESSES TRIES TO  MAKE LIGHT OF A BAD COUGH. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOWS WHAT'S NICE  ABOUT THAT? YOU DONE EVEN NEED TO RHYME  FOR THAT, THAT JUST WORKS. THAT JUST ULTIMATELY WORKS.
Jon: I PROMOTE THIS BOOK. AND I URGE PEOPLE TO  PURCHASE IT. IT IS A GREAT, AND IF I MAY  SAY THIS AND AGAIN A GREAT  COMPLIMENT, A GREAT STOCK  STUFFER. BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TAKE AM  THE ENTIRE STOCKING.
IT'S KIND OF A TOE BOOK  IN A WAY.
Jon: STICK IT IN THE TOE,  DOGFIGHT, IT'S HILARIOUS, ON  THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, THE GREAT CALVIN
