John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT MY BESTSELLING  AUTHOR WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED  "ZEALOT: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JESUS CHRIST."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  THE FANTASTIC REZA ALSAN. [APPLAUSE] REZA, REZA, REZA, REZA, REZA...
JOHN, JOHN, JOHN, JOHN, JOHN.
John: TALK ABOUT JESUS.
YOU'VE HEARD OF JESUS?
John: I THINK EVERYBODY HAS  HEARD OF JESUS. I THINK EVERYONE IN THE WORLD  HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS  WHETHER THEY WANT ONE OR NOT. THIS BOOK IS ABOUT JESUS THE  MAN, NOT SO MUCH JESUS THE  CHRIST.
IT'S ABOUT THE HISTORICAL  JESUS, NOT THE CHRIST OF FAITH. BUT, I MEAN, THE FACT OF THE  MATTER IS WHETHER YOU BELIEVE  THAT JESUS WAS GOD INCARNATE, GOD MADE FLESH OR NOT, YOU  BELIEVE THAT HE WAS ALSO MAN,  AND IF HE WAS MAN, THEN HE LIVED IN A SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE,  AND THAT TIME AND PLACE KIND OF  MATTERS. IT'S LIKE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO  KNOW WHO HE WAS, YOU HAVE TO PUT  HIS WORDS AND HIS ACTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HE  LIVED. THE TEACHINGS HAVE TO BE SEEN  ACCORDING TO THE SOCIAL ILLS  THAT HE CONFRONTED AND THE POLITICAL FORCES THAT HE  CONFRONTED.
JOHN: I LOVED THIS BOOK.
THANKS.
John: AND THE TIME AND  PLACE IN WHICH HE LIVED, IT WAS  TOTAL, TOTAL CHAOS, POSSIBLY THE MOST CHAOTIC TIME IN THAT  REGION, AND THAT REGION IS THE  MIDDLE EAST. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH.
THAT'S A HIGH CRAZY BAR.
THIS WAS ONLY THE MOST  TUMULTUOUS ERA IN THE HOLY LAND,  WHICH AS YOU SAY IS SAYING A LOT, A TIME OF APOCALYPTIC  FERVOR, A TIME IN WHICH WE'RE  SLOWLY MOVING TOWARDS THIS HUGE JEWISH REVOLT AGAINST THE ROMAN  EMPIRE THAT ULTIMATELY RESULTED  IN THE LEVELING OF JERUSALEM, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE,  THE EXILE OF THE JEWS AND EVERY  WORD THAT WAS EVER WRITTEN ABOUT JESUS IN THE GOSPELS WAS WRITTEN  AFTER THAT EVENT.
RIGHT. YOU TALK ABOUT HIM HOW IN THE  BIBLE JESUS REFERRED TO HIM AS A  DETACHED, CELESTIAL SPIRIT. WE WILL THINK OF HIM IN  PAINTINGS WITH BIRDS ON HIS ARMS  AND LIONS CURLED UP AT HIS  SHOES. OKAY, OKAY. THE LIONS CURLED UP AT HIS FEET. BUT THIS IS MAN DIRECTLY  INVOLVED WITH THE POLITICS OF  HIS TIME.
IF YOU KNEW NOTHING ELSE  ABOUT JESUS EXCEPT THAT HE WAS  CRUCIFIED, YOU'D KNOW ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHO HE WAS. CRUCIFIXION WAS A PUNISHMENT  THAT ROME RESERVED SOLELY FOR  CRIMES AGAINST THE STATE. REBELLION, INSURRECTION,  TREASON, SEDITION. THESE WERE THE ONLY CRIMES THAT  YOU COULD BE CRUCIFIED FOR. THE THIEVES WHO WERE CRUCIFIED  ALONGSIDE JESUS WERE NOT  THIEVES. THE GREEK WORD "LESTI" DOESN'T  MEAN THIEF. IT MEANS BANDIT. AND BANDIT WAS THE MOST COMMON  TERM IN JESUS' TIME FOR A REBEL,  FOR AN INSURE ARE EX-IST. HIS CRIME WAS ACTUALLY ETCHED  ABOVE HIS HEAD, KING OF THE  JEWS. FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CAN'T  FIGURE OUT WHY MODERN CHRISTIANS  THINK THAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF LIKE A ROMAN JOKE, YOU KNOW,  LIKE THE ROMANS WERE KNOWN FOR  THEIR SENSE OF HUMOR OR  SOMETHING. EVERYBODY WHO WAS CRUCIFIED,  EVERYBODY WHO WAS CRUCIFIED HAD  THEIR CRIME PUBLICLY DISPLAYED SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW WHAT  HAPPENS WHEN YOU DEFY THE WILL  OF ROME.
John: BUT WHY I RESPONDED  SO MUCH TO THIS AS WELL IS THAT  I'VE NOT HAD MUCH OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH JESUS, THE  CHRIST, IN MY LIFE BECAUSE AS A  CHILD, YOU HEAR THESE STORIES, AND HE DOES SEEM TOO GHOST LIKE,  TOO UNREAL. WHEN I WAS A KID GROWING UP, THE  STORY THAT I RESPONDED TO THE  MOST WAS THAT MOMENT ON THE CROSS WHERE HE'S SCREAMING, "MY  GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE THOU  FORSAKEN ME?"  HE BECOMES REAL BECAUSE THAT'S HUMAN ANGER.
I HAD A REAL EXPERIENCE  BECAUSE I CONVERTED TO  EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY WHEN I WAS A KID AND REALLY BURNED WITH  THIS GOSPEL MESSAGE THAT I  HEARD, REALLY, REALLY FELT IT DEEP IN MY LIFE. AND THEN IN COLLEGE WHEN I BEGAN  TO STUDY THE NEW TESTMENT, I  BECAME FAR MORE INTERESTED IN THIS HISTORICAL PERSON THAN I  EVER WAS OF THIS KIND OF  CELESTIAL CHRIST THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO, THIS MAN WHO LIVED  2,000 YEARS AGO WHO DEFIED THE  MOST POWERFUL EMPIRE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN, AND LOST, BUT  NEVERTHELESS, STOOD UP FOR THE  WEAK AND THE POWERLESS, THE OUTCAST AND THE DISPOSSESSED AND  ULTIMATELY SACRIFICED HIS LIFE  FOR THOSE PEOPLE. I MEAN, CHRISTIANS BELIEVE HE  SACRIFICED HIS LIFE TO FREE US  FROM SIN, A PERFECTLY FINE INTERPRETATION FOR THE CHRIST,  BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE MAN  JESUS IS HE WENT TO THE CROSS ON BEHALF OF THESE OUTCASTS THAT HE  WAS FIGHTING FOR.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND AND GO  TO THE WEB?
YEAH.
John: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE  THIS BOOK. YOU GOT TO GET IT. "ZEALOT" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES  NOW. THE FANTASTIC REZA ALSAN. [CHEERING AND APPLA
