Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS NEW YORK CITY'S 109th MAYOR, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO. SIR -- HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FEELING GOOD I JUST WISH  WE HAD DONE A BETTER JOB GETTING THE SNOW UP TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE. [LAUGHTER]
OH I KNOW. YOU'LL GET IT UP THERE. YOU KNOW
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN MAYOR IT HAS SNOWED -- WHAT, THREE TIMES?
THREE TIMES.
Jon: I REMEMBER BLOOMBERG 12 YEARS NEVER SNOWED ONCE. [LAUGHTER]
I THINK HE PAID THE RIGHT GUY. >>Jon: THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  >>I MEAN HE HAD THE MONEY.  >>YOU KNOW, BLOOMBERG WAS INTERESTING. HE WAS THERE 12 YEARS. HE WAS A BILLIONAIRE. YOU'VE BEEN THERE THREE WEEKS, YOU MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. [LAUGHTER] HOW IS IT STEPPING INTO HIS TINY, TINY SHOES? [LAUGHTER] WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE FROM THOSE THAT ARE MORE ACCUSTOMED TO-- IT WAS GIULIANI, BLOOMBERG. NOW, YOU COME IN, YOU PUT UP ALL THE POSTERS OF LENIN, STALIN, WHATEVER YOU'VE GOT IN THE OFFICE. [LAUGHTER] HOW HAVE THEY TAKEN THIS?
THE CHE GUEVARA POSTERS ARE VERY POPULAR. >>Jon: YES.
THEY REALLY ARE. GREAT RESPONSE, JON, GREAT RESPONSE.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S GOOD. ARE YOU, HAS IT BEEN OVERWHELMING?
IT'S NON-STOP, IT'S 24/7, IT'S THE ULTIMATE 24/7 JOB.  BUT I LOVE THIS PLACE. I REALLY LOVE THIS PLACE. AND IT'S ENDLESSLY FASCINATING TO ME, BUT I'D LIKE THE SNOW TO END. [LAUGHTER] >>Jon: YES. I'VE DONE THE SNOW EXPERIENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE NOW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT ELSE COULD WE DO TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE? [LAUGHTER]
WE HAVE AN EXPERIMENTAL EFFORT TO GET LOCUSTS IN UP THERE.
Jon: REALLY? YOU'RE GONNA GO BIBLICAL. [APPLAUSE] NOW, MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE UPPER EAST SIDE IS IT IS MANY OF WHAT I CALL MY PEOPLE, OLDER JEWS. AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. I FIND THEM TO NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT MUCH. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THEM. [LAUGHTER]
STOIC  >>Jon: VERY STOIC. THAT IS CORRECT.
STOIC IS THE WORD. I ASSOCIATE THAT WITH NEW YORKERS.
Jon: THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES I WANT TO GET TO. STOP AND FRISK, YOU'LL BE STOPPING THAT. WE'VE GOT PRE-K EDUCATION TAX POLICY, WE'VE GOT THE STABLES SITUATION  BUT THERE'S ONE THING IN PARTICULAR THAT IS, I THINK, MANY NEW YORKERS ARE TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S IN MANY WAYS EGREGIOUS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
BILL DEBLASIO IS CAUGHT ON CAMERA THIS WEEK EATING PIZZA WITH A KNIFE AND FORK. [APPLAUSE, BOO'S]
