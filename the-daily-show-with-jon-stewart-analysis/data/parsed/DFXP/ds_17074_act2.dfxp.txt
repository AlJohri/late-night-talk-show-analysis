THANK YOU FOR REJOINING US. YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING HAPPENING IN AMERICA AT THIS MOMENT ARE THE PRIMARIES, BUT, OF COURSE, THAT'S COMPLETELY NOT TRUE.
THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING AT THIS BIG MUSIC FESTIVAL THEY HAVE IN TEXAS, SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET.
Jon: TROUBLE AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL. WHAT COULD IT BE? WAS THE CROWD ASKED IF THEY WERE READY TO ROCK AND THEY SAID, IN A MINUTE. DID IT TURN OUT VAMPIRE WEEKEND IS ACTUAL VAMPIRES. DID SOMEONE SNEAK IN A BOTTLE OF WATER FROM THE OUTSIDE? THAT WILL BE $6, HIPPIE.
THERE'S A CONTROVERSY BREWING OVER A ADVERTISING AGENCY'S USE  OF 13 HOMELESS PEOPLE AS HUMAN WIFI HOT SPOTS.
BASICALLY THEY HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE TECHIES BETTER WIFI ACCESS. THEY HAVE ATTACHED WIFI ROUTERS TO HOMELESS PEOPLE, MAKING THEM IN EFFECT INDIVIDUAL WIFI HOT SPOTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO RATHER THAN TRAIN HOMELESS PEOPLE TO BECOME COMPUTER WORKERS, WE'RE TRAINING  THEM TO BECOME COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR NEW JOB, BILLY?
I GOT REPLACED BY A POLE.
Jon: IS WALKING AROUND WITH A 4G TRANSMITTER EVEN HEALTHY?
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS IS EXPLOITING THE HOMELESS. IT'S NOT EVEN MINIMUM WAGE. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF RADIATION EXPOSURE. SINCE I'M IN THE A SCIENTIST I CAN'T DELVE INTO THAT.
Jon: RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST, BUT YOU HAVE A PHONE. YOU CAN CALL A SCIENTIST OR CHECK THE INTERNET. YOU CAN GET ONLINE. TRY WAVING YOUR LAPTOP AROUND A HOMELESS PERSON. [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY THAT WORKS NOW. JUST LOOK AT THE SHIRT THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO WEAR. "I'M MARK, A 4G HOT SPOT." NOT, I'M MARK, A PERSON WITH A 4G HOT SPOT."  NOT "ASK ME HOW I, A HUMAN NAMED MARK, CAN HELP YOU," NONE OF THOSE THINGS. I AM A 4G HOT SPOT. FOR A SUGGESTED FEE OF $2, THEY'LL GIVE YOU THE PASS WORD TO THE 4G NETWORK HANGING AROUND THEIR NECKS. I WONDER WHAT THE PASSWORDS COULD BE. HOW ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW, [BLEEPED] YOU. OR MAYBE WHY DON'T YOU SHOVE THAT iPAD UP YOUR ASS. OR MAYBE, THE $2 YOU JUST GAVE ME FAILS TO PAY FOR THE SYSTEMATIC FAILURE OF NATION'S  WELFARE AND PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH POLICY? THAT'S A SECURE PASSWORD. [APPLAUSE] OKAY. THAT WINDED ME. SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE. THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA THAT NO ONE IS OKAY WITH, RIGHT?
BEFORE WE STAND UP FOR THE OPPRESSED POOR, IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU FOUND OUT A SANDWICH  SHOP HIRED A HOMELESS PERSON TO BE A BILLBOARD, WALK THE STREETS, EAT AT JOES AND PAY HIM  $20 AN HOUR, YOU WOULD APPLAUD THE SANDWICH SHOP AND SAY, WOW, THIS HOMELESS PERSON IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING. YOU'RE GETTING $20 AND YOU FEEL USEFUL.
Jon: YOU'RE MISSING A POINT. WHAT YOU SAID IS NOT GOING ON. IT'S NOT $20 AN HOUR. IT'S $20. SECOND, THEY'RE WEARING A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS, "I AM A HOT  SPOT" WHEREAS IF YOU'RE READING A SANDWICH BOARD, IT DOES NOT  READ, "I AM A SANDWICH BOARD."  [LAUGHTER] AND IF THIS IS SO GOOD, WHY STOP AT WIFI HOT SPOTS. AS LONG AS WE'RE USING VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AS OBJECTS, LET'S MAKE THE ONLINE  EXPERIENCE COMPLETE, MAYBE A MOBILE HOMELESS CAFE. CHAIRS, TABLES, AIR CONDITIONING, EVEN A RESTROOM. AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY, ONE OF THEM WILL SING TO YOU WITH THEIR SURPRISINGLY BEAUTIFUL VOICE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
