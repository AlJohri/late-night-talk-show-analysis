WELCOME BACK. WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A FEW WEEKS. WE'VE BEEN AWAY FOR A COUPLE  WEEKS. IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD TIME TO  CHECK IN ON ONE OF THE TOP ITEMS  ON THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. ISSUES THAT WERE AGREED UPON AS  A TOP PRIORITY
I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST  TIME THIS COUNTRY HAS DEBATED  HOW TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE. THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT
WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE  CAN TO PREVENT GUNS FROM FALLING  INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTALLY UNBALANCED OR CRIMINALS
EVERY IDEA SHOULD BE ON THE  TABLE AS WE DISCUSS HOW BEST TO  USE THAT
Jon: IF WE COULD CHANGE THE  TERM SHOOTING SPREE TO [BLEEP]. NOBODY WANTS TO BE KNOWN AS THE  GUY WHO [BLEEP] HIS PANTS. BUT THE POINT IS FINALLY SINCE  THE TERRIBLY VENT IN NEWTOWN A  BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE  SUBSTANTIAL ACTION TO REDUCE GUN  VIOLENCE. OVER 3,000 MORE AMERICAN VICTIMS  OF GUN VIOLENCE. LET'S CHECK IN. WHAT DID WE GET DONE?
THE ONLY VOTES THAT HAVE BEEN  TAKEN SINCE NEWTOWN HAVE  WEAKENED GUN CONTROL IN AMERICA.
Jon: OKAY. THE VOTE THE SENATE TOOK LAST  WEEK TO PREVENT THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM TAKING A LOOK AT GUN SHOP  OWNERS' INVENTORY TO MAKE SURE  THERE HASN'T BEEN THEFT
Jon: THAT MAKES SINCE. NEWTOWN IS ONE OF THE ONLY GUN  MEASURES PREVENTS THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT FROM TRACKING STOLEN  GUNS. WE'VE LOCALED GUNS INTO A FALSE  SENSE OF SECURITY. WE HAVE GUNS JUST FOR WEAPONS. STILL THIS INACTION HASN'T  DETERRED SOME GUN CONTROL  ADVOCATES. WE SPENT TIME WITH ONE  ESPECIALLY DETERMINED GROUP
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF  NOT NOT ALL GUN OWNERS ARE  AGAINST GUN REGULATION. SOME HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THEY'RE A  HAZARD
THE FIREARM IS DANGEROUS. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO  CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.
Reporter: AND HE HAS  IDENTIFIED THE BIGGEST DANGER OF  ALL.
THE PROBLEM WITH GUNS IS  THEY'RE JUST TOO LOUD.
Reporter: TOO LOUD? JUST TOO LOUD  Reporter: THAT'S THE PROBLEM  YES. EVERY TIME YOU FIRE ARRIVAL  WITHOUT HEARING PROTECTION, IT  WILL DO PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE TO YOU. EVERY TIME. YOU HEAR WITH YOUR EARS BUT WHAT  PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND IS YOU  HEAR WITH THE BONES IN YOUR FACE AND YOUR SKULL AS WELL
Reporter: YES. WHILE MOST EXPERTS HAVE STUDIED  GUN VIOLENCE FROM THE  PERSPECTIVE OF THE BULLET, FEW HAVE STUDIED IT FROM THE  PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOUND. YOU SEE, WHEN YOU FIRE A GUN, IT  HAS 140 DECIBELS OF SOUND WAVES  WHICH CAN CAUSE SEVERE AND IRREPARABLE HEARING DAMAGE BUT  THIS MAN WANTS THE PUBLIC TO  KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ANSWER TO THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENT GUN  NOISE
IT'S CALLED A SILENCER. WE... WE MANUFACTURE A MYRIAD OF  SUPPRESSORS FOR ALL SORTS OF  FIREARMS TO HELP REDUCE THE SOUND ENERGY
Reporter: THE SILENCERS ARE  LIKE A MEDICAL DEVICE
EVERYBODY IS BORN WITH TWO  FEARS, THE FEARS OF FALLING AND  THE FEAR OF LOUD NOISES
Reporter: AND BEING SHOT IN  THE FACE BY A MANIAC
THAT WILL HAVE A LOUD NOISE  Reporter: SOME WANT TO MAKE  IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO OBTAIN THESE WONDER DEVICES LIKE  THIS MAN OF THE COALITION TO  STOP GUN VIOLENCE
SILENCERS ARE DANGEROUS  ACCESSORIES. IT DOESN'T MAKE US SAFER TO  ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE SHOOTING  OTHERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN STEALTH WITHOUT BEING DETECTED
Reporter: YOU DON'T CARE  ABOUT YOUR EARS AT ALL, DO YOU?
I DO CARE ABOUT MY EARS BUT I  THINK THE PROBLEM WITH GUN  VIOLENCE WE'RE EXPERIENCING IN THIS COUNTRY HAS ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING TO DO WITH HEARING
Reporter: WHAT DO YOU  SUGGEST, WE GO BACK TO USING  PILLOWS AND TOWELS WRAPPED AROUND THE GUNS?
I SUGGEST ALLOWING PEOPLE TO  HEAR THE REPORT OF GUN FIRE IS  CRITICAL
Reporter: SADLY THINKING LIKE  THIS HAS LED THE GOVERNMENT TO  INSTITUTE BURDENSOME REGULATIONS ON SILENCERS, LIKE REGISTERING  THEM, CHECKING YOUR CRIMINAL  PAST, AND HAVING TO FILL OUT  FORMS. IT'S A TRAGIC HASSLE THAT THE  N.R.A. HOPES TO CHANGE.
THE REGULATION OF SILENCERS  IS SO OVERBEARING THAT  LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS DON'T WANT FOOL WITH THE PAPERWORK AND THE  RED TAPE
Reporter: EVERY SILENCER  TRANSACTION IS RECORDED
OH, YEAH. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
Reporter: THAT'S CRAZY  MOST COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD  DON'T REGULATE SILENCERS. IT'S ACTUALLY COURTESY IN  GERMANY TO USE A SILENCER
Reporter: I'M GOING TO KILL  YOUR FATHER. AS A COURTESY, I WILL SILENCE  IT.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO GERMANY. I CAN'T SPECULATE ON THAT
Reporter: ANTI-SILENCER NUTS  LIKE EVERETT WANT TO ACTUALLY  REGULATE POLITENESS
THERE'S NOTHING COURTEOUS  ABOUT IT. AMERICANS DO NOT WANT PEOPLE  FIRING GUNS WITH SILENCERS  EQUIPPED IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS
Reporter: DO YOU EVEN HAVE A  STUDY TO BACK THAT UP?
YOU DON'T NEED A STUDY ON  THAT. ALL YOU NEED IS COMMON SENSE.
Reporter: BUT WITH AMERICA'S  EARS SUFFERING A TRAGEDY EVERY  SINGLE DAY SHOULD HE CONSIDER A MORE RADICAL APPROACH. I HAVE AN IDEA. LESS GUNS OUT THERE. LESS NOISE OUT THERE. MAYBE REGULATION IS THE WAY TO  GO
NO. THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO  REGULATE GUNS JUST WILL NOT  WORK.
Reporter: GUN REGULATION WILL  NEVER WORK THEN?
IT DOESN'T WORK  Reporter: WHAT ABOUT THE  REGULATIONS WITH SILENCERS?
RIDICULOUS. COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. REGULATIONS OF SILENCERS ARE SOY  FIGURE TIFF THAT PEOPLE  TYPICALLY DON'T WANT TO BUY ONE.
Reporter: SO IT'S WORKING TOO  WELL
I SEE YOUR POINT. Reporter: YES, AMERICA. UNTIL THESE STRICT SILENCER LAWS  CHANGE, SCENES LIKE THIS WILL BE  ALL TOO COMMON.
