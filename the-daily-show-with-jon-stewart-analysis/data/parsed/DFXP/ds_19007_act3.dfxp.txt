[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OUR NEXT GUEST ONE OF OUR FAVORITES TWO FILMS COMING OUT THE COUNSELOR AND THE NEXT ONE CALLED "12 YEARS A SLAVE."
I BROUGHT HERE BACK JUST LIKE YOU --
AH.
I GOT IT. JUST DISTRACT.
RIGHT THERE. STAY AWAY FROM IT, BOY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S THE LIGHTEST MOMENT IN IT, I PROMISE YOU. IT'S A ROUGH MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL FASSBENDER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: I WANT TO TELL YOU. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ON THE PROGRAM BEFORE. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN DELIGHTFUL. YOU ARE IN THIS MOVIE A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PERSON.
I KNOW. I KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU -- I'M WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND I'M THINKING NO, DON'T MAKE HIM DO -- OH. BUT HE'S NO NICE.
IN LOUISIANA, THEY ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE MISBEHAVING OR OUT OF LINE, THEY SAY DON'T BE AN EPPS. THIS GUY'S NAME IS STILL SYNONYMOUS WITH BEING A BIT OF A PRICK.
Jon: REALLY? IT GOT INTO THE VERNACULAR. IT'S AN ACTUAL MEMOIR WRITTEN BY A MAN WHO IS FREE.
SALOMON NORTHROP A FREE MAN IN NEW YORK WHO GOT TRICKED BY A COUPLE OF CHARACTERS THINKING HE WAS GOING TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY DRUGGED HIM AND ENDED UP WAKING UP IN CHAINS AND SHIPPED DOWN TO THE SOUTH AND SPENT 12 YEARS IN SLAVERY.
Jon: AND IT IS NOT IN ANYWAY WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER A HOLLYWOOD REPRESENTATION. IT ISA A STARK REALITY -- REPRESENTATION. IT'S A STARK REALITY, DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO WATCH BUT INCREDIBLY WELL DONE.
I REALLY THINK STEVE HAS MADE A MASTER WORK HERE.
Jon: STEVE McQUEEN, JUST A PHENOMENAL FILMMAKER.
POWERFUL. IT'S NOT PULLING ANY PUNCHES BUT IT'S NOT ALSO TRYING TO HYPE ANYTHING UP. IT IS AS IT WAS.
Jon: DO PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM YOU ON SET? I'M CURIOUS, SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY DEMANDING.
I COULDN'T GO METHOD ON THIS >>ONE BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR ISIS BLACK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I COULD SEE THAT THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT. ARE THEY LIKE LET'S GO HAVE AN ICED TEA?
SOMETIMES, YEAH. WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH HEAVY MATERIAL IT'S NICE AND NECESSARY TO HAVE LIGHT MOMENTS IN BETWEEN SO IT DOESN'T BECOME ALL THE TIME JUST SO SORT OF HEAVY AND YOU KIND OF GET MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SORT OF BLINKERED ON IT. THE MOMENTS WHERE YOU CAN FIND RELIEF AND RESPITE YOU DO.
Jon: YOU HAVE READ THE SCRIPT. WHEN YOU ARE IN IT, WHEN YOU WATCH IT, DOES IT HAVE THE POWER. I WATCHED IT. I MAY HAVE -- THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME ACRID DUST IN MY OFFICE WHILE I WAS WATCHING IT WHICH CREATED A CERTAIN -- I THINK AN AUTONOMIC RESPONSE.
THAT AND THE ONIONS.
Jon: THAT AND I WEAR A SUIT OF ONIONS IN MY OFFICE. IT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND MOVING AT TIMES. DO YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO ENJOY IT AS A VIEWER HAVING BEEN A PART OF IT. DID IT STILL HAVE THE POWER TO YOU WHEN I WATCHED IT?
ABSOLUTELY. THE FIRST TIME I GOT THE SCRIPT IT WAS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IN TEARS AT THE END OF IT. IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL STORY AND SUCH AN IMPORTANT ONE. I REALLY WANTED TO BE PART OF IT AND TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF IT. I SAW IT -- I'VE ONLY SEEN IT ONCE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TELLURIDE IN COLORADO AT THE FILM FESTIVAL THERE. I WASHE REALLY QUITE SPEECHLESS AT THE END OF IT.
Jon: HOW DOES AN AUDIENCE -- IN AMERICA, OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE NOT FROM THIS COUNTRY BUT OBVIOUSLY SLAVERY AS MUCH AS WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN TAUGHT THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT THE WAR WAS BASICALLY JUST A COTTON PRICING ISSUE. HOW DOES AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE WATCH IT BECAUSE IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY MIRROR IN THE FACE OF A DARK TIME IN OUR HISTORY BUT ONE THAT WE OURSELVES LIVED WITH FOR 100 YEARS. WHAT IS AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE, HOW DO THEY RESPOND?
WELL, YOU KNOW LIKE HISTORY TEACHERS THAT, YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AND I THINK IT'S A UNIVERSAL STORY. YOU KNOW, SLAVERY WAS A PROBLEM NOT ONLY HERE BUT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A LITTLE BIT LONGER FOR IT TO BE ABOLISHED BUT SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE UK AND BRITAIN AND THE BELGIANS IN THE CONGO. THIS IS A UNIVERSAL STORY. AMERICA IS MADE UP OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL.
Jon: EXACTLY. IT WASN'T OUR FAULT. AS I WAS SAYING TO YOU -- (bleep) BRITAIN.
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S -- IT'S PHENOMENAL WORK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: EXCELLENT. I URGE PEOPLE TO GO CHECK IT OUT AS SOMEONE WHO IS WORKING ON SOMETHING MYSELF, WHAT A TERRIBLE IDEA TO WATCH HOW GOOD THIS IS. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOURS. WHEN IS IT --
Jon: IT'S JUST AS GOOD. IT'S OPEN IN SELECT CITIES AS WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] "12 YEARS A SLAVE." MICHAEL FASSBENDER.
