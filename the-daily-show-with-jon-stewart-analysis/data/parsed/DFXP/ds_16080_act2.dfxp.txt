Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. SO AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS WEEK, I CHATTED WITH CHRIS WALLACE SUNDAY ABOUT "SOUTH  PARK," PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND I MAY HAVE DURING THE INTERVIEW MENTIONED THAT FOX NEWS VIEWERS  ARE "THE MOST CONSISTENTLY MISINFORMED MEDIA VIEWERS," THE MOST CONSISTENTLY MISINFORMED. AS IT TURNS OUT, I WAS MISINFORMED. WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISING, BECAUSE I DO WATCH A LOT OF FOX NEWS. DAMMIT! I DID IT AGAIN. WAIT. [APPLAUSE] DON'T APPLAUD MY IGNORANCE. POLITIFACT, THE NON-PARTISAN FACT-CHECKING GUY OR GUYS OR GIRL, THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED MY  STATE, AND THEY FOUND THAT WHILE IN TWO OF THE NEWS SURVEY, FOX NEWS VIEWERS SCORED THE LOWEST, IN OTHER POLLS THEY WERE MERELY NEAR THE BOTTOM. [LAUGHTER] SOME OF FOX NEWS INDIVIDUAL SHOWS SCORED AS MORE INFORMED OF  LET'S SAY VIEWERS OF, I DON'T KNOW, THIS SHOW. SO THANKS FOR FACT [BLEEPED] ME, STONERS. GET A JOB! [APPLAUSE] WE CAN'T ALL TEACH WORLD HISTORY. ANYWAY, ULTIMATELY POLITIFACT DECLARED MY STATEMENT FALSE. I DEFER TO THEIR JUDGMENT, AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY MISTAKE. TO NOT DO SO WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE. IF I WERE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH MISTAKES AND MISSTATEMENTS AND NOT CORRECT THEM, ESPECIALLY  IF EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE MISSTATEMENTS HAPPENED TO GO IN ONE VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTION ON  THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, WELL, THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE VERY INTEGRITY AND CREDIBILITY THAT I WORK SO HARD TO PRETEND TO CARE ABOUT. LAFTD  [LAUGHTER] HEY, I KNOW POLITICAL FACT CHECKS MOSTLY POLITICAL STATEMENT, BUT HAS POLITIFACT  EVER CHECKED FOX FOR FALSE STATEMENTS? I'M HEARING THEY HAVE. [LAUGHTER] HERE'S ONE NOW. FOX SAID LESS THAN 10% OF OBAMA'S CABINET APPOINTEES HAVE WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. POLITIFACT SAYS THAT'S FALSE. FOX SAID THE WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL DIRECTOR ONCE SERVED AS RIGHT-HAND MAN TO THE ACORN CHIEF. POLITIFACT SAYS FALSE. TEXAS BOARD OF EDUCATION MAY ELIMINATE REFERENCES TO CHRISTMAS AND THE CONSTITUTION FROM TEXTBOOKS. BOY, THAT SOUNDS SCARY. POLITIFACT SAYS FALSE. [LAUGHTER] HEALTH CARE REFORM IS A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE. I REMEMBER THAT ONE. [LAUGHTER] THAT ONE WAS ALL OVER FOX. THEY WERE RUNNING WILD ON THAT ONE.   HEY, THIS IS EXCITING. THAT WAS THE POLITIFACT 2010 LIE OF THE YEAR. CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] CONGRATULATIONS. BY THE WAY, THE CORRECTION FOR THAT ONE WAS ISSUED, OH, WHEN MONKEYS FLEW OUT OF VIDAL  SASSOON'S ASS. THAT'S RANDOM. WHERE WERE WE? THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAS OPENLY STATED THEY WANT TO DECLARE WAR ON ISRAEL. FALSE. AMERICAN TROOPS HAVE NEVER BEEN UNDER THE FORMAL CONTROL OF ANOTHER NATION. THAT SOUNDS BAD. FALSE. FLORIDA REPUBLICAN, GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT'S APPROVAL RATINGS ARE UP. FALSE. IT'S GETTING A LITTLE CROWDED. MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH CARE PLAN IS WILDLY UNPOPULAR AMONG STATE RESIDENTS. FALSE. THERE'S BEEN MORE DEBT UNDER OBAMA THAN ALL OTHER PRESIDENTS COMBINED. FALSE. THE HEALTH CARE BILL INCLUDES DEATH PANELS. WOW, THAT WAS THE 2009 POLITIFACT LIE OF THE YEAR. WOW. [APPLAUSE] FOX NEWS IS LIKE A LYING DYNASTY. THEY'RE LIKE THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS OF LYING. WITHOUT THE "PATRIOT" PART BECAUSE I THINK WE KNOW PATRIOTS CANNOT TELL A LIE.   WOW. I'M GETTING TIRED. I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A SNACK HERE, A LITTLE TRAIL MIX. PROTEIN AND FRUIT. IT GIVES YOU THAT ENERGY BURST TO CLIMB MOUNT FIB. [LAUGHTER]   CASH FOR CLUNKERS WILL GIVE GOVERNMENT COMPLETE ACCESS TO YOUR HOME COMPUTER. FALSE. HALTING GULF DRILLING COSTS $8 BILLION A DAY IN IMPORTS. THAT ONE GOT A "PANTS ON FIRE" RATING. THAT'S LIKE THE FILET MIGNON OF  [BLEEPED].   DEMOCRATS PLAN LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN HISTORY. FALSE. ERIC HOLDER WAS INVOLVED IN THE DISMISSAL OF CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST NEW BLACK PANTHERS. FALSE. OBAMA VOTED PRESENT IN THE U.S. SENATE QUITE OFTEN. FALSE. WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVISOR JOHN HOLDREN PROPOSED FORCED ABORTIONS AND PUTTING STERILANTS  IN DRINKING WATER. [LAUGHTER] PANTS ON FIRE. LABOR UNION PRESIDENT ANDY STERN IS THE MOST FREQUENT VISITOR AT WHITE HOUSE. FALSE. AMERICA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH AUTOMATIC CITIZENSHIP UPON BIRTH. FALSE. O'REILLY NEVER CALLED GEORGE TILLER A BABY KILLER, ONLY REPORTING WHAT OTHERS CALLED HIM. FALSE. ONLY FOX NEWS PICKED UP THAT ANITA DUNN SAID MAO WAS ONE OF HER FAVORITE PHILOSOPHERS. FALSE. NOBODY AT FOX NEWS EVER SAID YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL IF YOU DON'T BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. THAT'S PANTS ON FIRE. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY GOT A LOT OF [BLEEPED] CORRECTING TO DO.
