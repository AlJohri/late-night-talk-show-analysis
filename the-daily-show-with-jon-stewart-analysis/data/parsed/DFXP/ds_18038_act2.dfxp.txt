Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW JOURNALISM MAY BE  SUFFERING IN AMERICA BUT IN  MOST AMERICA IT'S FLOUR  SHALLING. WYATT CENAC HAS MORE IN THIS,  HIS FINAL REPORT.
Reporter: IN PUERTO RICO  THE MOST POPULAR TELEVISION  SHOW IS CALLED SUPERXLUCIDO STARRING LA COMAI AND IT'S A  A NEWS PROGRAM. IN FACT, THIS JUGGERNAUT  GETS 40% OF THE PUERTO RICAN  AUDIENCE AND CRUSHES MOST OTHER MAJOR NEWS NETWORKS IN  THE STATE. THOUGH I TRAVELED TO SAN  JUAN TO LEARN THEIR SECRET. >
IS IT JUST ME OR IS  THERE A WEIRD MONSTER LADY  RIGHT THERE?
NO, SHE IS A JOURNALIST.
SHE'S A JOURNALIST.
YES, SHE IS. THIS IS LIKE THE FAMOUS.
I CAME HERE TO TALK TO  PUERTO RICO'S MOST TRUSTED  JOURNALIST.
YES, PEOPLE GET IF YOUS  FROM ME.
THIS IS A PUPPET.
IT'S A LADY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW  YOUR JOURNALISTS.
BECAUSE WE DO  INVESTIGATIONS ALL THE TIME. THIS IS WATT WORLD WILL BE  WITHIN 50 YEARS FROM NOW.
MEN AND FOAM WOMEN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE ARE THE FUTURE OF THE  WORLD.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,  I'M OUT? I'M OUT, I'M OUT.
HEY, WYATT, THANK YOU,  GOOD-BYE.
HEY, WYATT.
THIS HAD TO BE SOME SORT  OF JOKE. SO I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING  I HADN'T DONE PRIOR TO  FLYING ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE TO REPORT IN A STORY IN THE  FIRST PLACE. WATCH THE SHOW. AND THERE SHE WAS GRILLING  THE PUERTO RICAN GOVERNOR  FORESTALLING A MURDER  INVESTIGATION.
INTERVIEWING ALL THE  CANDIDATES FOR THE LATEST  GUBERNATORIAL RACE. BUSTING A NEWSPAPER FOR  BRIBING A SENATOR.
I WATCHED THIS PUPPET FOR  HOURS DO THINGS NO FLESH  REPORTER COULD DO.
I WISH I COULD LEARN FROM  HER. I MEAN HOW ARE PEOPLE DOING  IT?
GRACIA.
(LAUGHTER)
OH MY GOD.
NO!
SOMEHOW THE MAGIC OR  PUERTO RICAN RUM HAD  TRANSFORMED ME. I HAD TO GO BACK. I NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND.
SO LOOKS LIKE I'M A  PUPPET.
YES, SIR.
CAN YOU SHOW ME THE PATH. TEACH ME TO BE A BETTER  JOURNALIST?
THERE WAS SO MUCH I  NEEDED TO LEARN.
YOU HAD TO HAVE A-- HOW  DO YOU SAY PANTALONES. YOU HAD TO HAVE --
FIND OUT ABOUT POLITICAL  CORRUPTION.
YES, YOU HAVE TO BE SURE,  THAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS  IS THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.
TO BE VERY SMART AS I AM.
BUT I WAS STILL MISSING  ONE KEY INGREDIENT, MURROW  HAD GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD  LUCK. CRONKITE HAD THAT'S THE WAY  IT IS. AND COMAE HAS GOT-- THAT'S  WHAT IT IS.
THAT'S A CATCH-PHRASE?
YEAH. --   (LAUGHTER)  THAT REALLY MEANS WHAT A  HUGE CANDLE.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S  RIGHT, WYATT, THAT'S RIGHT.
WYATT, THAT'S THE FIRST  WORDS THAT HAD TO USE IN  ORDER TO BE A GOOD  JOURNALIST.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO IT.
ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU GUYS  HELP ME GET DOWN OFF THIS  CHAIR? MY TIME HAD COME TO FINALLY  SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER. I ARRIVED IN OUR NATION'S  CAPITOL AND FOUND  INOPERATION ALL AROUND MY. I NOW HAD THE PANTLONES TO  ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT NO  ONE WAS WILLING TO ASK. HERE WAS MY MOMENT. TIME TO SHOW THE PRESS CORPS  HOW A REAL JOURNALIST DOES  IT.
I WILL SEE BE HERE  OBVIOUSLY TO TAKE YOUR  QUESTIONS ON ALL ISSUES.
