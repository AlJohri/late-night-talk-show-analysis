[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ACADEMY AWARD WINNING ACTOR. THE NEW MOVIE IS CALLED "THE HUNGER GAMES. :  CATCHING FIRE."
YOU FOUGHT VERY HARD IN THE GAMES MISS EVERDEEN BUT THEY WERE GAMES. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE IN A REAL WAR?
NO.
NEITHER WOULD I.
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
WHEN YOU AND PETER ARE ON TOUR YOU NEED TO SMILE AND BE GRATEFUL BUT ABOVE ALL YOU NEED BE MADLY PREPARED TO END IT ALL IN LOVE. CAN YOU DO THAT?
YES.
YES WHAT?
I'LL CONVINCE THEM.
NO, CONVINCE ME.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER LAWRENCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
Jon: THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
WOW.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO BE EXHAUSTED.
I'M SO TIRED.
Jon: HOW MANY OF THESE CRAP FESTS HAVE YOU DONE?
100,000.
Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
YOU ARE 100,001.
Jon: IS THIS IT?
YES, THIS IS MY LAST ONE AND I'M ON VACATION. NOT THAT I HAVEN'T HAD A BLAST.
Jon: IT'S WONDERFUL. WE'RE GETTING ALONG FAMOUSLY. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MOVIE --
WHY WOULD WE TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE?
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU THIS? I GOT A CNN BREAKING NEWS ALERT WHEN YOU GOT YOUR HAIRCUT.
I KNOW. THAT WAS SERIOUSLY THE WEIRDEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
Jon: IT HAS TO BE THIS SCRUTINY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE GETTING YOUR HAIRCUT AND FINDING OUT ABOUT IT ON THE NEWS. IT WAS THE WORDEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
Jon: IN CNN'S DEFENSE -- IF THEY WATCHED CNN THEY WOULD BE ONLY ONES. I'M GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND. YOU'VE DONE YOUR WORK. YOU CAN SIT BACK. YOU ARE SMART AND CHARMING BUT I'M GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND HERE. ARE YOU READY?
YES.
Jon: THIS IS SOMETHING I JUST FOUND ON THE INTERNET.
OH, NO.
Jon: LOOK AT THAT PICTURE. THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU, YEAH.
OKAY.
Jon: NO GOOD?
DOES IT?
Jon: IT'S A YOUNG HELEN MIRREN. AM I OUT OF MY GOURD.
YOU BLEW MY MIND FROM THIS ENTIRE SITUATION. THAT WAS SO RANDOM. THI HAD NO IDEA WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO AND I COULDN'T HAVE GUESSED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHY I DID IT?
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO.
Jon: YOU DON'T PREPARE FOR THIS VERY WELL.
THE PRODUCERS AND EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THE SHOW TELLS EVERYONE. HE'S NOT GOING TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE MOVIE OR A LOT ABOUT YOU. YOU HAVE A PREINTERVIEW AND GO OVER BULLET POINTS AND THINGS WE WANT TO TOUCH ON. NO, NO, NO YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO TALK. HE PROBABLY WON'T ASK YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THE MOVIE HE MIGHT NOT ASK YOU ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DID THEY SAY ANYTHING ELSE LIKE DON'T LOOK HIM IN THE EYES. HE'S A FREAKY LITTLE MAN.
THEY TOLD ME NOT TO LOOK AT YOUR NIPPLES.
Jon: WHAT? THAT'S WEIRD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] HERE IS WHY --
THEY'VE BEEN STARING AT YOUR NIPPLES THE WHOLE TIME.
Jon: HERE IS WHY I THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT THEY WOULD TELL YOU THAT. IT'S MY BEST FEATURE. [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO RELAX NOW? DO THEY GET TO -- DO THEY LET YOU GO AWAY? ARE YOU KEPT IN A CRISPER? WHAT DO THEY DO WITH YOU NOW?
I HAVE TO WEAR A BELL AROUND MY NECK BUT THEY LET ME RUN AROUND A LITTLE. I KNOW, I'M GOING HAVE TEN DAYS OFF.
Jon: NICE. ENJOY THAT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHO YOU SHOULD VISIT DURING THAT TIME?
HELEN MIRREN. SHE'S A YOUNG  JENNIFER LAWRENCE.
YOU ARE SO WEIRD.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK THAT LOOKS -- I DID I SAW IT. NO, I CAN I SEE IT. SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND I'M COMPLIMENTED BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT WOULD YOU DO THAT.
Jon: YEAH. WHAT WOULD BE -- IS THERE ANYTHING -- HERE IS WHAT I FIGURE --
SHOULD MY HANDS BE ON THE DESK LIKE THIS.
Jon: NO, NO. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF TURKEY SALMONELLA ON HERE.
I PASSED THAT. -- I PASSED THAT TURKEY BACKSTAGE.
Jon: I DON'T BLAME YOU THERE.
I THOUGHT FOR ONE SECOND ABOUT PUTTING IT ON MY HEAD AND RUNNING OUT. I THOUGHT, YOU HAVE ENOUGH ATTENTION. IT'S TIME TO REST.
Jon: IF YOU PUT THAT TURKEY ON YOUR HEAD AND RAN AROUND AND I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. I'M NOT A SCIENTIST OR AN ENGINEER BUT I THINK THE INTERNET WOULD BREAK. [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE AT HOME WOULD JUST -- HEADS WOULD COME FLYING OFF. SERIOUSLY WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE MOVIE. ARE WE OUT OF TIME?
OKAY.
Jon: OH, OKAY. NO, SIT. THE MOVIES ARE GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND I DO KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THEM.
OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU ARE IN IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
MM-HMMM. THEY MUST HAVE WRITTEN YOU UP A SYNOPSIS. YOU DIDN'T GET BULLET POINTS. WHAT KIND OF -- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? EVERY ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYERS BY THE WAY -- EMPLOYERS, HE IS AT THE BOTTOM OF A FOOD CHAIN. I WAS DRINKING A BEER AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HERE WOULD SAY I HAVE TEQUILA UNDER MY DESK. I HAVE VODKA. WE HAVE AN ALCOHOL CART. I HAVE A STILL UPSTAIRS. IT'S LIKE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD AROUND HERE. DO YOU THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO END THE JUNKET TOUR. I FEEL LIKE IT'S A REMARKABLY SPIRITED AND INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEW. I DON'T WANT TO SAY --
I THINK THAT --
Jon: IN MANY WAYS I REMIND ME OF A YOUNG CHARLIE ROSE.
AND I REMIND MYSELF OF --
Jon: OF?
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND.
Jon: A YOUNG HELEN MIRREN.
WHY DIDN'T I SAY THAT? SO TIRED. GOD.
Jon: THE HUNGER GAMES CATCHING FIRE WILL BE IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. I KNEW THAT.
I KNEW IT, TOO. IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT THERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M GOING TO SAY THIS, HERE IS WHAT IS NICE ABOUT THIS YOUNG LADY. THIS IS A HUGE FRANCHISE MOVIE. BUT THIS WOMAN'S TALENT AND ABILITIES HAS ESTABLISHED HERSELF OUTSIDE OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT FRANCHISE, A FRANCHISE LIKE THAT COULD PEG A PERSON OF LESSER ABILITIES IN. I THINK YOUR WORK IN DAVID RUSSELL'S MOVIES AND ALL THAT INOCULATES YOU FROM THAT KIND OF THING, SO I CONGRATULATE YOU.
