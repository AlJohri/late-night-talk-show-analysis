WITHIN WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE QUARTERBACK FOR THE DENVER BRONCOS, HIS NEW BOOK IS YOU  WILL CAD THROUGH MY EYES, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, TIM TEBOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU. FIRST OF ALL, I'M SORRY TO SAY DURING THIS TIME OF THE FOOTBALL STRIKE YOU REALLY  LET YOURSELF GO.
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.
I'M TRYING.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP. ARE YOU BORED, IS THIS THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER NOT HAVING  FOOTBALL DURING THIS TIME.
PRETTY MUCH IT IS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE GONE THIS LONG WITHOUT COMPETING OR PLAYING SINCE I  WAS PROBABLY FOUR YEARS OLD. SO IT IS A LITTLE WEIRD. IT GIVES ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN AND MEET UP WITH GUYS ON MY TEAM AND CONTINUE TO WORK HARD.
Jon: ARE YOU TRAINING WITH THE GUYS ON YOUR TEAM.
I AM.
Jon: WHO ORGANIZES SOMETHING LIKE THAT I KNOW THE TEAM IS NOT ALLOWED, I GUESS, RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK TO ANYONE NECESSARILY INVOLVED WITH THE ORGANIZATION. BUT WE'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND BRIAN REALLY LIEDS THE GROUP AND WE HAVE WORKOUTSES  WITH ALL MY RECEIVERS AND TOWARDS AS WELL.
Jon: SO WHERE DOES, YOUR PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYER. DO YOU JUST SHOW UP AT LIKE A FIELD IN FLORIDA AND LIKE SOME LITTLE KIDS ARE LIKE-- HUH? LIKE WHAT --
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FEW TIMES AND HEY, DOW MIND IF WE USE THIS CORNER OF THE FIELD. AND THEY'RE LIKE SURE, SO THEY JUST STOP AND START TAKING PICTURES.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY BLOW THEIR MINDS. YOUR LIFE, HOW OLD ARE YOU.
23.
Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE 24 TO WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.
MOST PEOPLE. I THOUGHT 23 WAS A GOOD AGE AND GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME.
Jon: EXACTLY. BUT IT IS A VERY INTERESTING LINE. YOUR PARENTS WERE MISSIONARIES IN THE PHILIPPINES.
YES.
Jon: NOW WERE YOU-- YOU WERE NOT RAISED THERE YOUR WHOLE LIFE, JUST EARLY PART.
WE LIVED THERE FOR FIVE YEARS WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND BEFORE I WAS BORN AND MOVED  BACK TO THE STATES AND MY PARENTS TRAVELED BACK AND FORTH. AND I HAVE BEEN THERE PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR SINCE I WAS IS A.
Jon: YOU SUPPORT AN ORPHANNAGE NOW THERE.
YES, RIGHT. MY DAD SUPPORTED THAT ORPHANNAGE. I BUILT THAT ORPHANNAGE IN 1991 AND NOW THE FOUNDATION WHICH I SUPPORTED SUPPORTS A  LITTLE OVER VI00 ORPHANS.
Jon: WOW, YOU SEEM LIKE A REAL [BLEEP].
BUT THAT'S-- .
Jon: I AM TELLING YOU, YOU READ THIS BOOK AND DOW SUCH NICE THINGS. WHEN YOU ARE A MISSIONARY'S KID, BECAUSE I KNOW SOMEBODY LIKE MY PARENTS MADE ME GO  TO SYNAGOGUE AND HEBREW SCHOOL AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING I COULD TO GET OUT OF IT. BUT IF YOU ARE A MISSIONARY'S KID, CAN YOU BE LIKE I'M BORED. LIKE IS THERE ANY WAY, CAN YOU GET OUT OF IT OR YOU CAN'T.
I MEAN, YOU TRY. MOST OF THE TIME THEY KIND OF DRAG TO US CHURCH AND WHAT NOT. BUT SO-- .
Jon: EVERYBODY STAY IN YOUR SEATS, STAY IN YOUR SEATS.
I WOULD BEG MY PARENTS PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ME GO TO CHURCH. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO FACE ALL THE FANS. SOMETIMES THEN THEY WOULD LET ME GET OUT OF IT. BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.
Jon: THEY LET YOU GO THROUGH. SOME INTERESTING STUFF IN THERE ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE GOING FOR THE NATIONAL CHAMPION, YOUR COACH IS  URBAN MYER AT THE TIME, AND IF YOU WON THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP UNDER FLORIDA  HE WOULD RECEIVE A BONUS.
YES.
Jon: SIZABLE. WHAT WAS THE BONUS AGAIN?
IT WAS A LOT. IT WAS A LOT.
Jon: LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS.
YEAH. GOOD FOR HIM.
Jon: PU WERE BUSTING HIS CHOPS A LITTLE BIT.
I HAD TO.
Jon: YOU THOUGHT IF YOU WIN IN THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS HE GETS A  MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU WERE ASKING HIM YOU CAN I GET MORE JUICE AT THE JUICE BAR, CAN I --
ACTUALLY, WE WERE RAZZING MIAMI AND GETTING OFF THE PLANE. I AM WALKING BEHIND HIM I GRABBED HIS SHOULDER BEFORE HE WALKED DOWN TO ALL THE MEDIA. WOW, PRETTY NICE PLACE DOWN HERE, HUH. SO I WAS LIKE YOU GET A LOT OF MONEY IF WE WIN, DON'T YOU. I WAS JUST JOKING BUT I WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, HOW ABOUT IF I PLAY A LITTLE HARDER, YOU  GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. SEE WHAT WE CAN WORK IT OUT.
Jon: IT BRINGS UP AN ISSUE BECAUSE I'M WATCHING THIS OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY  FOOTBALL SCANDAL GO DOWN. THESE PLAYERS,.
OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY AS OPPOSED TO JUST OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, THESE GUYS THEY  DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY, THEY DO GET A SCHOLARSHIP TO THE SCHOOL BUT THEY TRADED SOME  OF THEIR SWAG FOR TATTOOS. NOW IT SEEMS UNFAIR.
THEY FROM GOOD TATTOOS.
Jon: IT SHOULD SAY I GAVE ME SHIRT AND ALL I GOT WAS THIS LOUSY TATTOO. BUT IT SEEMS AN UNFAIR THING. THEY BRING IN SO MANY MILLIONS FOR THESE UNIVERSITIES. YET THEY AREN'T-- DOES THAT SEEM RIGHT IN YOUR EYES?
WELL, IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION. I CAN LOOK ON BOTH SIDES, ON THE NCAA SIDE AND SEE HOW HARD IT IS. THEY HAVE TO MANAGE SO MANY ATHLETES AND MAKE SURE THAT NONE ARE DOING ANYTHING  ILLEGAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE HAVING A LOT OF ATHLETES THAT WORK EXTREMELY  HARD AND MAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS FOR UNIVERSITIES. AND THEY'RE STILL, YOU KNOW, STRUGGLING JUST TO GO OUT TO OUTBACK TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. SO I CAN SEE ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING FAIR WOULD BE IF SOME OF THE ATHLETES GOT A LITTLE BIT  MORE SO THEY COULD GO TO DINNER, AFFORD A SCOOT TORE DRIVE AROUND CAMPUS, LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT. NOT TO GET PAID.
Jon: REALLY, A SCOOTER.
A SCOOTER, I MEAN AT COLLEGE, IT WOULD HELP SO MUCH.
Jon: I THEY WANT TO GO TO OUTBACK AND A SCOOTER. THAT'S GREAT.
BUT IT'S A GREAT STORY. I WISH DENVER BRONCOS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING THIS YEAR.
HOPEFULLY PRETTY GOOD.
Jon: LISTEN, ELWAY IS NOW THE GM THAT HAS TO BE GOOD FOR YOU.
YES, HE IS.
Jon: AS A QUARTERBACK.
PRETTY GOOD GUY TO LEARN FROM.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN SOME TIME. TIM TEBOW THROUGH MY EYES ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
