(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE STAR OF "PROMETHEUS."
WHAT DID HE SAY?
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D WANT KNOW TELL YOU.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
I'M SORRY.
OH, MY GOD, I'LL FIND IT. WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID TRY HARDER.
Jon: I BET SHE SMELLS NICE. (LAUGHTER) PLEASE WELCOME MICHAEL FASSBENDER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS, RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?
NOTHING MUCH, GOOD TO BE HERE...
Jon: IT'S EXCITING. THIS "PROMETHEUS" IS EXCITING. MICHAEL, TELL ME THIS, WHAT ARE ALL THE PLOT LINES? (LAUGHTER)
RIGHT, ARCHAEOLOGISTS. PAINTINGS.
Jon: DO WE SURVIVE AS A SPECIES AT THE END AND WHO WINS-- THE ALIENTOR HUMANS? YOU CAN JUST NOD IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.
OKAY, ALL IS GOOD AT THE END. FOR MANKIND. FOR NOW. (LAUGHTER) (BLEEP).
Jon: IT'S THE "PROMETHEUS"...
THE "PROMETHEUS" FINGER.
Jon: WERE YOU AN "ALIENS" GUY WHEN YOU WERE...
I WAS. THE FIRST TIME I SAW I IT I THINK I WAS 13 OR SO.
Jon: ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YEAH.
Jon: ARE YOU THAT... DID YOU WAIT A LONG TIME? (LAUGHTER) WERE YOU 13 WHEN IT CAME OUT?
NO, WELL IT CAME OUT IN '72, DIDN'T IT, AND I WAS...
Jon: YES, IT DID. (LAUGHTER)
SO I WAS TWO WHEN IT CAME OUT  OUT.
Jon: PRETTY (BLEEP)ING PROUD OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YOU? (LAUGHTER) TWO YEARS OLD, LOOK AT YOU!
I GOT TO SEE IT ON VIDEO CASSETTE. IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER.
Jon: OH! OH! "WHEN I WAS A KID WE HAD TO DO THE REEL BY HAND, I TELL YOU."
YOU HAD TO ACT IT OUT. ONE PERSON WENT TO THE CINEMA AND ACTED IT OUT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
Jon: THAT'S HILARIOUS. WHERE ARE YOU... ARE YOU LIVING IN LONDON? WHERE DO YOU LIVE? IS THAT YOUR BASE?
LONDON'S THE BASE. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A BIT OF TIME IN NEW YORK, ACTUALLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU. WE HAVE SPACE. (LAUGHTER) YOU WEREN'T THERE FOR THE JUBILEE?
I WASN'T, NO. I WAS THERE JUST BEFORE BECAUSE "PROMETHEUS" PREMIERED THERE AND THAT WAS THURSDAY NIGHT. I'M PRETTY SURE. AND THEN I SORT OF... I CAME... I FLEW OUT, THEN, ON SATURDAY MORNING, THE JUBILEE WAS OVER THE WEEKEND AND ALL THIS WEEK.
Jon: DID THEY SEEM EXCITED BECAUSE WE SAW FOOTAGE HERE AND IT LOOKED LIKE AN OLD LADY  STARING AT BOATS. (LAUGHTER)
EXACTLY. AND IT WAS RAINING ALSO.
Jon: IT WAS TERRIBLE WEATHER.
ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT IT IS. YEAH.
Jon: I CHECKED IN ON CNN AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE "LOOK AT THE BOATS! IS THAT THE BOAT! ARE THOSE FLOWERS?" PEOPLE WERE LIKE "LOOK! SHE'S TURNING HER HEAD!" BUT IS IT... YOU KNOW, IT'S A WONDERFUL CITY TO LIVE. I THINK VERY SIMILAR TO NEW YORK.
VERY SIMILAR. I'M... FROM WHAT I KNOW OF NEW YORK. I MEAN, I WAS ALWAYS, LIKE, SORT OF DREAMED TO COME HERE AND STUDY HERE BUT IT WAS JUST  EASIER TO GO TO LONDON.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU... OH, YOU MEAN STUDYING ACTING?
YEAH, TO GO TO ACTING SCHOOL.
Jon: I WENT TO AN ACTING SCHOOL HERE, AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S NOT VERY GOOD. (LAUGHTER) YOU MADE A MUCH BETTER... (LAUGHTER). THE CHOICE THAT YOU MADE TO STUDY WITH THE MASTERS. WHEREAS I CAME TO NEW YORK AND...
Jon: WHAT DID YOU STUDY?
Jon: WHERE OR WHAT?
WHERE.
Jon: I STUDIED AT A PLACE CALLED H.B. STUDIOS. AND I CAN SAY THIS NOW BECAUSE BOTH TEACHERS ARE DEAD. HERBERTBERGOFF AND UTA HAGGEN VERY TALENTED...
OH, WOW!
Jon: YES AND FOR $5 YOU COULD SIT IN THE CLASS AND HAVE HERBERT IN THE BACK EATING  CANDIES GOING "REALLY?" (LAUGHTER) "WHY ARE YOU WASTING AN OLD  MAN'S TIME?" HE WOULD JUST FLIP ROLE LOWS INTO HIS MOUTH AND HE'D SCORN UPON ME. FOR FIVE BUCKS.
MY TEACHERS AS WELL. BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE SCHOOL IT WAS... THEY WERE IN THEIR SORT OF TWILIGHT YEARS AND THEY  WERE TAPE RECORDING THIS ONE CHARACTER AND I WAS LIKE, YOUR, THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. BUT HE WAS... HE WAS PRETTY SHARP. IT WAS AN INTERESTING PLACE.
Jon: DID THEY BRING IN HIGH-LEVEL ACTORS TO COME IN AND GIVE WORKSHOPS AND  DEMONSTRATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
NO, THEY JUST BROUGHT PAST PUPILS THAT WANTED TO COME BACK TO THAT SCHOOL THAT STILL HAD  THAT SORT OF THOUSAND-YARD STARE.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
SO THE THEORY WAS TO BREAK YOU DOWN AND PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER AGAIN BUT I HAVE A  FEELING THAT A N A LOT OF THE CASES THERE WERE ALL THESE BITS. OFF YOU GO. GO OUT INTO THE ACTING WORLD AND GOOD LUCK!
Jon: (LAUGHS) I GUESS THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. GOOD DAY! MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE NOW DRIVING BARGES IN THE JUBILEE. (LAUGHTER) "PROMETHEUS" WILL BE IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY. THE HUMANS WIN?
THE HUMANS WIN. FOR NOW.
Jon: OOH! FASSBENDER!
