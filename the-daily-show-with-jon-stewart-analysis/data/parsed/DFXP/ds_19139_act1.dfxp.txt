FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." BOOM! WHO AM I? MY NAME IS JON STEWART. YOU CAN CALL ME, STARLORD. MY GUEST TONIGHT-- WHAT, AM I THE ONLY GUY WHO SAW WHAT IS IT -- GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY THIS WEEK? [BLEEPED] HIGH BROW AUDIENCE TONIGHT. SO BAD. WAIT, WAIT, DON'T TELL ME. DID YOU SEE THAT? IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW? [AUDIENCE CHEERING]. [BLEEPED]. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ELIZABETH MOSS. BUT FIRST, LET ME TAKE YOU BACK. LAST WEEK ON "THE DAILY SHOW"...
CRISIS ON THE BORDER.
BORDER BEDLAM.
HUMANITARIAN NIGHTMARE.
CHAOS AND DESPAIR.
THE SITUATION IS SO DIRE.
THE CRISIS AT HAND DEMANDS ACTION.
UNLESS WE SIT DOWN AND REASON TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH THE STATUS QUO.
Jon: SO ALL WE NEED TO SAVE OURSELVES IS FOR CONGRESS TO SIT DOWN AND REASON. [LAUGHTER] TOGETHER. OH, MY GOD! [SCREAMING MANIACALLY] CAN THEY DO IT? [LAUGHTER] DID THEY DO IT? BECAUSE ACTUALLY, SPOILER ALERT, YOU COULD HAVE WATCHED THE NEWS BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY AND YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW, BUT IF YOU DID NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE AT THE THEATER, HERE'S HOW IT WENT DOWN STARTING ON JULY 8th:
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY ASKED CONGRESS FOR $3.7 BILLION TO DEAL WITH THE FLOOD OF UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY.
Jon: OKAY. BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ASKED FOR IT BY PUTTING IT ON A WHITE BOARD ON A FENCE. $3.7 BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. CONGRESS?
WE'RE NOT GOING TO WRITE BLANK CHECK FOR OVER $4 BILLION. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: REAL, REAL QUICK, YOU DO REALIZE HOUSE CHAIRMAN OF HOMELAND SECURITY, THAT A BLANK CHECK CAN'T BE FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER. YOU KNOW THAT? ONCE YOU WRITE A SPECIFIC NUMBER, $4 BILLION, $2 BILLION, WHATEVER IT IS, IT LOSES THE VITAL QUALITY OF BLANKNESS. IT'S NOT BLANK ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD REALLY ELECT PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW HOW CHECKS WORK. [LAUGHTER] SIR, THERE'S NO AMOUNT HERE. SIR, YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN, YOU'VE JUST WRITTEN... IT'S JUST A STICK FIGURE WITH BAGS OF MONEY ON IT. I KNOW. I WANT TO DEPOSIT THE MONEY, BUT THE GUY WON'T TELL ME HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN THE BAGS. [LAUGHTER] SO, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND $3.7 BILLION ON THIS, FINE, SMASH CUT JULY 31st.
THE SENATE'S OWN $2.7 BILLION PLAN FAILED TO PASS A PRELIMINARY VOTE THIS WEEK.
Jon: KNOCKED A BILLION DOLLARS OFF IT AND STILL BLOCKED IT. OF COURSE. IS THERE ANYBODY WITH AN IDEA OUT THERE HOW TO SOLVE THIS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, ANYBODY AT ALL?
HOUSE REPUBLICANS ROLLING OUT THEIR OWN PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS.
Jon: IS THERE ANYBODY? ANYBODY? ANYBODY WHO'S GOT SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW THE DEAL... ANYBODY?
THESE ARE JUST LITTLE KIDS THAT ARE COMING OVER, AND YOU'RE CALLING FOR A SHOOT-TO-KILL.
LITTLE KIDS?
Jon: SO WE KNOW THAT IF IN THE ABSENCE OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, THE KU KLUX KLAN IS READY TO FILL THE VOID.
IN OUR TEN-MINUTE INTERVIEW, THE KLAN MEMBERS LISTED THEIR USUAL GRIEVANCES -- BLACK, JEWS AND GAYS, AND NOW IMMIGRANTS.
Jon: YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS WE'RE LISTING GRIEVANCES, AND YOU MAY SEE THIS AS A MINOR POINT, A BIT NICK PICKY, BUT FLIP-FLOPS, DUDE, REALLY? FLIP FLOPS? I MEAN, THESE ARE, THESE ARE YOUR GOOD SATIN ROBES. THESE ARE THE BIG ROBES. I'M ASSUMING THESE ARE THE FORMAL ROBES. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD AT THE BEACH. YOU'RE A GROWN MAN WHO, ALBEIT LIKES TO DRESS UP IN BED SHEETS AND SET FIRE TO THINGS. LOOK, I DON'T CARE IF IT'S SUMMER WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU'RE ON TELEVISION. PUT ON A NICE PAIR OF SLACKS AND SOME REAL SHOES. NO ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE YOU'RE THE MASTER RACE IF THEY THINK YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TIE YOUR LACES. [LAUGHTER] SO, ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN THE KLAN PLAN AND OUR HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. UM, ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO WITH THE HOUSE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED CONGRESS FOR $3.7 BILLION TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS ON THE BORDER.
SPEAKER BOEHNER TRIMMED THAT DOWN TO ABOUT $1.5 BILLION, BUT THE HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE CUT THAT EVEN FURTHER, $659 MILLION.
Jon: WHAT? THAT'S NOT IN THE EVEN IN THE SAME BALLPARK... THAT'S NOT EVEN IN THE SAME... THAT'S NOT A NEGOTIATION... IT'S LIKE THIS MAN NEEDS A HEART TRANSPLANT. OH, HEART TRANSPLANT? WELL, HOW ABOUT IF I GIVE HIM FOUR POSSUM HEARTS AND A TRANSISTOR RADIO? [LAUGHTER]. BUT I GUESS COMPARED TO THE SENATE'S NOTHING BILL, THE HOUSE AT LEAST HAS ACTUAL LEGISLATION. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS PASS THIS BILL AND THEY ALL LOOK LIKE HEROES.
TED CRUZ, THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM TEXAS, HE HAD PARTY IN TOWN HERE IN D.C. ON WEDNESDAY, SERVING BEER AND PIZZA. HE TOLD MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR ANY LEGISLATION ON THE ISSUE OF THE BORDER.
YEAH.
Jon: UH, FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE HOW WHEN A BRITISH GUY SAYS "BEER AND PIZZA," HE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE [BLEEPED] VOMIT. APPARENTLY THEY HAD PARTY WHERE THEY HAD BEER AND PIZZA. AH, OH. AND SECOND OF ALL, WHO CARES ABOUT SENATOR TED CRUZ. HE'S IN THE SENATE. THEY ALREADY DID THEIR NOTHING. PIZZA OR NO PIZZA, SCREW THAT GUY. WHO CARES WHAT HE THINKS?
G.O.P. LEADERSHIP CANCELED A VOTE YESTERDAY ON A $659 MILLION BORDER BILL.
THEY COULDN'T GATHER THE VOTES NEEDED.
Jon: THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WERE SO CLOSE TO THE APPEARANCE OF DOING SOMETHING. AND THEIR PLAN WAS SABOTAGED AND WITH PIZZA NO LESS. THIS MAY BE PIZZA'S DARKEST HOURS. [LAUGHTER] SECOND ONLY THE WHEN THE NAZIS INVADE FRANCE UNDER THIS PRETENSE OF DELIVERING FIVE MILLION OF THEM. [AUDIENCE REACTS] OH, WE CAN'T USE DOMINO'S. IS THAT FOR REAL? EARLIER IT WAS DOMINO'S. I DON'T KNOW. NOW IT'S CHANGED TO THIS BIZARRE ANGELO'S PIZZA. TALK ABOUT SOME CRAZY BREAD. SO, SO WHAT TOPPINGS DID THE CRUZ CONTINGENT OF THE HOUSE PUT ON THEIR [BLEEPED] YOU PIZZA?
THE NEW VERSION WOULD ALSO GIVE $35 MILLION TO BORDER STATE GOVERNORS TO PAY FOR NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD TWEAK LANGUAGE IN THAT 2008 ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAW THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO QUICKLY DEPORT UNACCOMPANIED MINORS.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THE SENATE IS ALREADY OUT SO NOTHING IN THIS BILL MATTERS ANYWAY. WHY NOT HAVE SOME FUN WITH THIS? MINORS MUST BE DEPORTED VIA CIRCUS CANNON OR REPLACE THE BORDER FENCE WITH A WIPEOUT COURSE, AND IF YOU GET THROUGH, HEY, YOU'RE IN. [LAUGHTER] DRESS THE BORDER PATROL UP AS MOUNTIES SO THEY THINK THEY'VE COME HERE AND GONE TOO FAR AND TURN BACK AROUND. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, THIS IS SO INSANE. WE HAD AN URGENT CRISIS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THE PRESIDENT OFFERS A SOLUTION. THE SENATE CAN'T EVEN GET THEIRS TO AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE, AND THE HOUSE PASSES A DRACONIAN VERSION THAT SOMEHOW MOVES TO THE RIGHT OF ITSELF. AT THIS POINT CAN ANYTHING BE DONE?
BOEHNER RELEASED A STATEMENT AFTER HE YANKED THE BILL SAYING THIS, "THERE ARE NUMEROUS STEPS THE PRESIDENT CAN AND SHOULD BE TAKING RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION." [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID JOHN BOEHNER JUST SUGGEST THAT IF CONGRESS WON'T ACT TO CHANGE A LAW IT DOESN'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD? CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE THERE'S A GUY RIGHT NOW SUING THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT.
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER TO SUE U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
Jon: WOW. IF BOEHNER EVER GETS AHOLD OF THAT OTHER BOEHNER, HIS FACE IS GONNA BE SO REDDISH ORANGE. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
