Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY  GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FORMER SENATOR  OLYMPIA SNOWE IS GOING TO BE  JOINING US. FUN FACT. THEY IS MARRIED TO '90s RAP  SENSATION SNOW. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT. HURRICANE SANDY, THE CONTINUING  TROPICAL [BLEEP] STORM THAT IS  ROCKING THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION. YESTERDAY PRESS SECRETARY JAY  CARNEY, LIKE AN INTREPID WEATHER  CHANNEL ANCHOR, STOOD AND LET THE WIND AND RAIN PUMMEL HIM FOR  OUR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES.
ON THE I.R.S., DID THE  PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE  BEING TRUTHFUL? DOES HE THINK THAT THE  LEADERSHIP THERE NEEDS TO  CHANGE?
PART OF IT IS FACT. IT'S NOT AN IF ANYMORE. IT'S FACT.
THAT'S YOUR OPINION, ALL  RIGHT.
THERE HAVE BEEN TWICE AS MANY  PROSECUTIONS AS ALL PREVIOUS  ADMINISTRATIONS COMBINED.
IS THERE A SIEGE MENTALITY  BACK ON THE WEST WING RIGHT NOW.
ABSOLUTELY NOT. Jon: SIEGE MENTALITY. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? IS IT THE VAT OF BOILING OIL IN  THE MOAT? IS THAT WHY YOU SAY THAT. THE VAT OF BOILING OIL. I DON'T KNOW. WHO KNOWS. YOU KNOW WHAT? FAIR IS FAIR. IT IS A GOOD WEEK FOR  CONSERVATIVES. ANGRY RHETORIC, A LEVEL OF UPSET  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT FOR ONCE  SEEMS SOMEWHAT APPROPRIATE.
IT CUTS TO THIS  ADMINISTRATION'S CORE  CREDIBILITY. IT CUTS TO ITS TRUST.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY APPALLING. THIS IS DISTURBING. JUST SHOCKING TO ME. UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS VERY BAD NEWS FOR THE  WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: WHAT THEY JUST SAID  WAS... HANNITY, TUCKER CARLSON  AND DUCEY ARE (MUMBLING). YOU SEE, WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THEIR COMPLAINTS HAD SOME  LEGITIMACY. ALTHOUGH MR. DOOCY I CAN GO  WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOUR O-FACE  IS.   ( APPLAUSE )   YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH  WEEK FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T JUST THE  INTENSITY OF THE CRITICISM. IT WASN'T JUST THE INTENSITY OF  THE CRITICISM OF THE WHITE HOUSE  THAT SEEMED APPROPRIATE BUT AT TIMES THE CONTENT OF THE  CRITICISM.
NOW THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE  SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT THE I.R.S.,  I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT ON THE HEELS OF HILLARY CLINTON  SAYING I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING  ABOUT THOSE EXTRA REQUESTS FOR SECURITY IN BENGHAZI LIBYA. WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT  ANYTHING THAT MATTERS? IS THERE ANYBODY WHO IS MINDING  THE SHOP?
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING  YESTERDAY. YOU KNOW, MEG AND KELLY, WE'VE  HAD OUR DIFFERENCES. MAYBE IT'S TIME WE DO A SHOW  TOGETHER. CALL IT FOX AND FRENEMY. BEAUTY AND THE BRIS. WHAT? I'M SORRY. I'M BEING TOLD THIS IS GOING TO  BE CALLED REGIS AND KELLY. ALL RIGHT. IT HAS GOTTEN SO BAD FOR THE  ADMINISTRATION, SOME ON THE  RIGHT WERE ALMOST OFFERING MORE SYMPATHETIC RATIONALES FOR THEM.
I THINK THEY ALSO HAVE  TERRIBLE WHAT I CALL  SCANDAL-DAR, LIKE RADAR. IF YOU CUT ME OPEN, I HAVE SO  MUCH SCANDAL-DAR
Jon: WHAT DANA PERINO WAS  SAYING IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE  DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE WHEN SOMETHING IS PERCEIVED AS  CORRUPT OR SCANDALOUS IN THE  PUBLIC'S EYE. ALTHOUGH SCANDAL-DAR IS NOT HOW  YOU WOULD TYPICALLY PHRASE THAT. IT'S NOT YOU CAN'T JUST ADD THE  SUFFICIENT TICKS-DAR TO  SOMETHING. IT'S A MORE FINESSE WORD PLAY. WHAT MAKES GAY-DAR WORK IS GAY,  RHYMES WITH RAY. SO, FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU HAD A  WEIRD SIXTH SENSE ABOUT WHERE  CHURCHES WERE, YOU COULD SAY THAT'S PRAYER-DAR. THAT WOULD WORK OR FOR SOME  REASON YOU ALWAYS DO "WHEN THIS  MONTH STARTED" THAT WOULD BE  MAY-DAR. TOUPEE-DAR. THAT WOULD WORK. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   HE'S LITERALLY... THAT WAS JUST  AN ENORMOUSLY LONG WALK JUST TO [BLEEP] ON THAT GUY. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO POINT TO  THAT BIT AT ALL. I'LL BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH  YOU. I WORKED UTTERLY BACKWARDS ON  THAT BIT. THE DANA PERINO BIT. NOTHING TO THAT. WE JUST THOUGHT WHAT A NICE WAY  TO GET INTO [BLEEP] DONALD  TRUMP. THAT'S ALL THAT WAS. THAT'S IT. EMBARRASSING. ANYWAY, SO THIS IS ALL BAD FOR  THE ADMINISTRATION. THE QUESTION IS, HOW BAD?
THIS IS NIXONIAN. THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHOSE INNER  NIXON IS BEING REVEALED
Jon: THAT'S IT. IF THESE MEASURES FROM THE  I.R.S. AND JUSTICE WERE TAKEN AT  THE BEHEST OF THE WHITE HOUSE THAT IS NIXONIAN. AT BEST, IF YOU BELIEVE THE  ADMINISTRATION ONLY FOUND OUT  ABOUT THIS STUFF THROUGH NEWS REPORTS, IT'S STILL BAD. IT'S JUST THAT THE PRESIDENT'S  INNER MAGOO IS BEING REVEALED. IT'S MAGOOVIAN. I REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT MAGOO  NOMINATED A COAT RACK FOR  SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. IT WAS COMICAL. UNTIL, OF COURSE, THE  DEVASTATING DEPRESSION. BUT THIS WEEK I CAN'T NITPICK. THE FLOOD GATES ARE OPEN. EVERY CRITIC SUDDENLY HAS  CREDIBILITY. EVERY SINGLE ONE. WHO WOULDN'T HAVE THE STANDING  TO BE ABLE TO LEGITIMATELY  CRITICIZE THIS PRESIDENT. I CAN'T IMAGINE.
I CAN'T IMAGINE... Jon: HOLD ON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AREN'T YOU DONALD RUMSFELD? I ASSUME YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY  SOMETHING LIKE I CAN'T IMAGINE  POSSIBLY COMMENTING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS, GIVEN MY DUBIOUS  RELATIONSHIP WITH GOOD  GOVERNANCE.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW A PERSON  COULD STAND UP THERE WHEN  EVERYONE INVOLVED KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK. THE IDEA THAT IT WAS SOMEHOW  RELATED TO A YOU TUBE VIDEO AND  THAT THAT NARRATIVE KEPT BEING PROMOTED, I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE  IT FIT THEIR HOPES AND WHAT THEY  WANTED TO BE THE INDICATION. ... WHAT THEY WANTEDDED TO BE  THE CASE.
Jon: THANK YOU, DONALD  RUMSFELD. I WAS THINKING THERE WAS NO WAY  TO OVERREACH. YOU BELIEVED THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION IS PROMOTING A  NARRATIVE, NOT BECAUSE IT'S REAL BUT BECAUSE IT FITS THEIR HOPES  AND WHAT THEY WANT TO BE THE  CASE? YOU? SENIOR W.M.D. MAGILL CUTTY,  ESQUIRE. THE GUY WHO WANTED TO GO AFTER  SADDAM HUSSEIN ON 9/11 WHILE THE  PRESIDENT WAS STILL READING "MY PET GOAT"? YOU? AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO MAKE THAT  ATTACK HAPPEN EVEN THOUGH SADDAM  HUSSEIN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH  9/11? RUMSFELD IS GERMAN FOR PROMOTING  A NARRATIVE BECAUSE IT FITS YOUR  HOPES AND WHAT YOU WANT TO BE THE CASE. IT IS THE RARE GERMAN WORD THAT  IS ACTUALLY SHORTER THAN THE  THING IT IS DESCRIBING. SO, NO! YOU ALONE DON'T GET TO COME TO  THE VICTORY PARADE FOR THE  REPUBLICANS. YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY WHO DOESN'T  GET TO WEIGH IN.
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE WORST  INCIDENTS FRANKLY
Jon: DID I SAY ONE GUY? IS THAT HE WHOSE NAME I DARE NOT  SPEAK. THE ONE WHO SETS OFF MY  CHENEY-DAR. WHO LED OUR COUNTRY ASTRAY-DAR? SHOT HIS FRIEND IN THE FAY-DAR? HAS THE HEART OF GRAY-DAR? DON'T. YOU. DARE.
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE WORST  INCIDENTS THAT FRANKLY THAT I  CAN RECALL IN MY CAREER. THEY CLAIMED IT WAS BECAUSE OF A  DEMONSTRATION VIDEO SO THEY  WOULDN'T HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT THEIR  COMPETENCE. THEY LIED.
Jon: YOU DO NOT GET TO USE  THE L-WORD. IN FACT, YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO  WATCH THE L-WORD. DICK. WHICH I CAN CALL YOU BECAUSE  THAT'S YOUR NAME. AFTER THE THE LINES YOU TOLD,  YOU DON'T GET TO DOUBT ANYONE'S  CREDIBILITY. IF A BASEBALL BREAKS YOUR WINDOW  AND YOUR GRAND KID WALKS IN THE  DOOR WITH A BASEBALL BAT AND TELLS YOU THAT ZACH AND CODY  FROM THE SWEET LIFE DID IT WHILE  THEY WERE PLAYING A GAME WITH SPONGE BOB, YOU JUST HAVE TO [BLEEP] CHOKE THAT DOWN. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. AND LISTEN CLOSE. ALL OF THESE SCANDALS COULD ADD  UP TO VERY BAD REPERCUSSIONS FOR  THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. MANY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS  ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR MOMENT OF  RIGHTEOUSNESS BUT GUESS WHAT? HISTORY DIDN'T START FRIDAY. AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  TRANSGRESSIONS DON'T WIPE AWAY  YOURS WHICH ARE MANY AND  GRIEVOUS. ENJOY WATCHING YOUR FRIENDS HAVE  THEIR FUN BUT TWEEDAL-DICK AND  TWEEDAL-RUM DON'T GET TO JOIN THE PARTY. IT'S LIKE THIS. IT'S LIKE THIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S MIKE TYSON. HE DOESN'T GET TO MAKE FUN OF  SOMEONE'S TATTOO.
