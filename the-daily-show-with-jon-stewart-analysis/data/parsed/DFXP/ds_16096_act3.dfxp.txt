(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A POLITICAL ANALYST FOR THE FOX NEWS NETWORK. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "MUZZLED. THE ASSAULT ON HONEST DEBATE." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JUAN WILLIAMS. SIR? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR JOINING US. (APPLAUSE) SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE. GREAT TO BE HERE.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. "MUZZLED: THE ASSAULT ON HONEST DEBATE." SO TELL US. I GUESS THE IMPETUS OF THIS BOOK FOR THE MOST PART THE INCIDENT THAT YOU HAD WITH COMMENTS THAT  YOU HAD MADE DURING A SEGMENT ON O'REILLY'S SHOW, NPR FIRES YOU. WALK US THROUGH THAT VERY BRIEFLY.
WELL, AS YOU KNOW, O'REILLY WAS ON THE VIEW AND SAID THAT  MUSLIMS ATTACKED US ON 9/11. AFTER HE SAYS THAT WHOOP I GOLDBERG AND JOY BEHAR WALKS OFF THE SET AND THEN O'REILLY SAYS  "I MEANT RADICAL EXTREMIST MUSLIMS." THEY COME BACK. SO THE NEXT O'REILLY SHOW, HE HAS ME ON AND HE SAYS KEL ME WHERE I WENT WRONG. SO I SAID LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. THE FACT A THAT THERE WERE MUSLIMS WHO ATTACKED US, WHO SITED JIHAD AND I CAN'T GET AWAY  FROM THE FACT THAT WE JUST HAD THE TIMES SQUARE BOMBER TALKING ABOUT THE STARTUP OF WAR ON  AMERICA AND I TELL YOU WHAT IN ALL HONESTY, WHEN I'M IN AN AIRPORT AND I SEE PEOPLE DRESSED  IN MUSLIM GARB FIRST AND FOREMOST IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AS MUSLIM I HAVE ANXIETY AND IT  MAKES ME NERVOUS. THEN I WENT ON TO SAY BUT TIMOTHY McVEIGH IS A CHRISTIAN AND THOSE PEOPLE FROM THE  WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH WHO MAKE THOSE OFFENSIVE RANTS AT FUNERALS THEY'RE CHRISTIAN AND  WE DON'T STEREOTYPE CHRISTIANS ON THAT BASIS AND WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SAY  THAT WE DON'T ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO CRAZY STUFF LIKE BURN THE  KORAN OR CUT SOME CAB DRIVER'S THROAT HERE IN NEW YORK. SO I SAID ALL THAT. BUT THEN, OF COURSE, THE TOP PART WAS TAKEN AWAY BY PEOPLE WHO, YOU KNOW, THE COUNCIL ON  ARAB-AMERICAN RELATIONS OR WHATEVER AND THEN NPR ALSO ACTING ON THAT.
Jon: YOU HAD BEEN, WITHING AT NPR.
TEN YEARS.
Jon: SO YOU MUST HAVE HAD SO MANY THOUGHT BAGS. (LAUGHTER) TOTE. WHEN YOU TRAVEL, CARRYING THINGS MUST NEVER BE AN ISSUE.
NOT A PROBLEM. NOT A PROBLEM.
Jon: SO NPR... NOW... BACKING THIS UP. THOSE ARE FOR OUR PRESENT ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF DISCOURSE I THINK PRETTY MILD. IN ALMOST ANY WAY YOU FRAME IT, CERTAINLY THE NETWORK THAT YOU SAID HELP THE ON AND CERTAINLY WHAT YOU SEE OVER THE AIRWAVES, NPR DECIDES YOU CAN NO LONGER WORK THERE. THAT SEEMS UNFAIR.
TO ME. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'D BEEN THERE TEN YEARS. I'D WORKED AT FOX BEFORE I CAME TO NPR. AND, YOU KNOW, JON...
Jon: YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD PROVED TO THEM AT SOME LEVEL THAT YOU WERE NOT A BIGOT.
I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED TO PROVE IT. I'VE WRITTEN... I WROTE "EYES ON THE PRIZE." I'VE WIN THE WELL-RECEIVED  BIOGRAPHY OF JUSTICE MARSHALL, THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ON THE COURT. I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED TO PROVE TO ANYBODY WHO I AM. BUT I WAS STUNNED THAT THEY WOULD... I SAID DID YOU GUYS LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF THE TRANSCRIPT? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? THAT I'M, IN FACT, CHALLENGING BILL O'REILLY. THAT I'M TRYING TO SAY WE NEED TO AFFIRM THE IDEA THAT AMERICA'S A PLACE OF RELIGIOUS  TOLERANCE EVEN AS AMERICA DEALS WITH WHAT IS THE REAL ANXIETY OVER THE LINK BETWEEN ARAB  EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. AND TO JUST SAY OH, IT DOESN'T EXIST, CAN'T SAY THAT, ONLY  ALLOWS THOSE FEELINGS TO FESTER AND THEN YOU HAVE ERUPTIONS AND PEOPLE DO WILD AND CRAZY THINGS, AWFUL THINGS. DID YOU HEAR THIS? NO, NOTHING YOU CAN SAY, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO COME IN, WE DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU, YOUR  CONTRACT IS OVER, YOU ARE GONE.
Jon: SO IN MANY WAYS YOU THINK THEY JUST... BECAUSE YOU WORK AT FOX NEWS THEY WANTED, MAYBE, TO GET RID OF YOU.
I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS AN ANTIPATHY TOWARDS FOX. WHY ARE YOU WORKING THERE? ALL ALONG...
Jon: NOW WHY DO THEY HAVE AN ANTIPATHY TOWARDS THAT ORGANIZATION? THEY SEEM LIKE VERY... (LAUGHTER). I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR, OBVIOUSLY, WITH WHAT GOES ON OVER THERE.
I DON'T THINK SO. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BUT THEY SEEM PLEASANT ENOUGH. I GUESS I WAS SHOCKED BY THE WHOLE THING. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONCLUSIONS THAT YOU'VE DRAWN OUT FROM IT.
SURE.
Jon: WHAT IS YOUR SENSE NOW OF WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE DEAL WITH EACH OTHER  EITHER IN THE NEWS OR EACH OTHER ON EARTH?
THAT'S THERE'S A TOTAL LACK OF HONEST DEBATE. WE'VE GOT A NICHE MEDIA LANDSCAPE. IF YOU'RE A LIBERAL YOU SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? FOX NEWS IS BIASED. IF YOU'RE A LIBERAL YOU SAY "I DON'T LIKE WHAT GOES ON ON CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO. I DON'T LIKE THAT "WALL STREET JOURNAL" EDITORIAL PAGE."  IF YOU'RE A CONSERVATIVE YOU SAY "JON STEWART IS BIASED."  YOU SAY "THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS BIASED."  YOU SAY "HOLLYWOOD IS BIASED." AND AS A RESULT PEOPLE RARELY... PEOPLE GO TO MEDIA SOURCES THAT AFFIRM PREEXISTING OPINIONS RATHER THAN SAYING HEY, WAIT, LET ME LISTEN TO WHAT THIS GUY HAS TO SAY. AND IT MAY BE THAT WHATEVER THE SIDE HAS TO SAY IS RIDICULOUS, OKAY, DISMISS IT. BUT AT LEAST LISTEN, GIVE THEM SOME SENSE OF RESPECT BECAUSE TO ME IF YOU DON'T HAVE HONEST  DEBATE, IF YOU DON'T HAVE HONEST EXCHANGE OF IDEAS YOU'RE GOING NOWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU DON'T SOLVE BIG QUESTIONS, BIG PROBLEMS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: BUT WHAT IS THE CAUSALITY, DO YOU THINK? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, PART OF THE STRATEGY, IT SEEMS, OF PARTISAN MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS IS TO  DELEGITIMIZE YOUR OPPONENT BY SUGGESTING BIAS RATHER THAN DEALING WITH THE CRITICISMS  BECAUSE SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE CAN COME OUT OF ANYONE. WHEN I WATCH FOX NEWS, IT... THERE'S OFTEN TIMES THEY'LL BRING UP A POINT THAT IS EXTREMELY VALID.
SURE.
Jon: I'M THINKING OF ONE, HOLD ON. (LAUGHTER) BUT... (LAUGHTER)
YOU STOPPED!
Jon: BUT ISN'T THAT... ISN'T IT EASY TO SAY THAT IT'S A VERY EASY THING TO DO TO DISMISS  IT, NOT ALL ORGANIZATIONS THAT CLAIM TO BE PARTISAN ARE AS SUCH AND THEY'RE NOT ALL CREATED  EQUAL AND WHAT IS THE THING THAT IS STYMIEING THE DEBATE? OR ALLOWING IT TO BE HONEST? WHAT IS IT THAT'S PREVENTING, IN YOUR MIND, THE HONEST ASPECT OF IT?
BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN. I THINK THAT IT'S RIGHT NOW AS I SAID PEOPLE GET LOCKED INTO ONE  PERSPECTIVE OR ANOTHER AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON. AND GULF STREAM TO WEB SITES WITH OTHER LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE. THEY EVEN GET INTO SUBGROUPS OF THAT WEB SITE AND IF YOU'RE NOT  EXACTLY ON TARGET, YOU'RE A BAD GUY. IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH ME, YOU'RE A TRAITOR. THE LAST BOOK I WROTE "ENOUGH" WAS ABOUT BILL COSBY AND COSBY  SAYING "WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS, HIGH DROPOUT RATES, ACCEPTANCE OF THE DRUG CULTURE. WE HAVE TO STOP THIS." AND COSBY, ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS LABELED A BAD GUY, HE'S  AIRING DIRTY LAUNDRY. LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN WASHINGTON. A REPUBLICAN WHO SAYS "MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME TAX HIKES. " NOW HE'S A RHINO, A REPUBLICAN IN NAME ONLY. TO BE A REAL REPUBLICAN YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH THE CLUB, BELIEVE WHAT THE CRAB TELLS YOU AND  DON'T DEVIATE. SO YOU CAN'T HAVE A DEBATE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION.
Jon: ARE WE CONFUSING, THOUGH, CRITICISM WITH PERSECUTION? ARE WE OVERREACTING TO THE CRITICISM AS WELL? YOU KNOW... DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO STICK AROUND?
FOR YOU...
Jon: SEVEN.
THAT'S A DEAL.
Jon: "MUZZLED" IS UP ON THE BOOKSHELVES RIGHT
