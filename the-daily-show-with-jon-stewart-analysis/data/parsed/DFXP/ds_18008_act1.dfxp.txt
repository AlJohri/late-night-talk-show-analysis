FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH  JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S REALLY JUST SCRIBBLES. [ LAUGHTER ] MY NAME IS JON STEWART. DIRECTOR PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON IS  JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW  FILM "THE MASTER" WHICH IS IN NO  WAY A DEVASTATING CRITIQUE OF  ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ] IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH? WILL THEY LEAVE US ALONE NOW? TONIGHT, OF COURSE, WAS THE VICE  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT, NOBODY SAW  THIS COMING, BOTH VICE  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TONIGHT  ON NATIONAL COMING OUT DAY CAME OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY DURING THE  DEBATE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE REAL WINNERS TONIGHT, TWO  LUCKY FELLAS TO BE NAMED LATER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME  TALKING ABOUT THE CHOICES FOR  PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT. SOME EXPRESS FRUSTRATION WITH  LIMITED OPTIONS. DID YOU KNOW THAT THE FOUR MEN  THAT WE HAVE ARE BY FAR THE  CREAM OF CROP IN WASHINGTON OR  AS WE REFER IT TO THE CREAM OF  CRAP. [ LAUGHTER ] WE SALUTE THEIR DOWN TICKET  BRETHREN IN A SEGMENT CALLED  "YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARDS."   WE'LL START IN MISSOURI WHERE LUCKY SHOW ME STATERS COULD TURN  TODD AKIN INTO A REPUBLICAN  SENATOR. HE HAS IDEAS FRNCH WHAT I  UNDERSTAND FROM DOCTORS THAT'S  REALLY RARE. IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE RAPE, THE  FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS TO TRY TO  SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN.
Jon: YEAH, THE FEMALE BODY  SHUTS IT DOWN. IF IT'S LEGITIMATE RAPE. TODD AKIN ON THE VAGINAS MAGICAL  POWERS. YES, KIT REPEL RAPE SPERM. IT CAN TURN ORDINARY ROCKS INTO  BEAUTIFUL GEMS IN MINUTES AND  THIS IS TRUE, THIS IS NEW, THE  NEW UPGRADED OPERATING SYSTEM VAGINA, TWO VAGINAS THAT PASS  EACH OTHER CAN SWAP PLAYLISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] DIDN'T KNOW THAT. NOW, PEOPLE ARE GOING I'VE GOT  TO UPGRADE. SINCE THE COMMENTS AKIN HAS GONE  FROM AN 11 POINT LEAD TO SIX  POINTS BEHIND THE INCUMBENT BUT  SOME FOLKS LIKE REVEREND STONEY SHAW ARE STICKING WITH HIM.
SOME OF MY FAMILY WAS, YOU  KNOW, MY CHILDREN, DAD, YOU'RE  NOT GOING TO SUPPORT HIM, ARE  YOU? EVERYBODY IS TURNING AGAINST  HIM. I SAID, WELL THERE WAS ANOTHER  GUY EVERYBODY TURNED AGAINST.
Jon: JERRY SANDUSKY? NO. [ LAUGHTER ] BILL BUCKNER? [ LAUGHTER ] AMERICAN IDOL AS SANJAYA.
THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY  EVERYBODY TURNED AGAINST JESUS  CHRIST BUT HE PREVAILED. ♪ ♪
Jon: SORRY I'M GETTING A  CALL HOLD ON. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, HEY, HEY, JESUS, YEAH I  HEARD IT. I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS, TOO,  THAT YOU JESUS ARE COMPARED TO  TODD AKIN. DON'T BE INSECURE YOU ARE THE  KING OF KICK, MY FRIEND. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. SEE YOU SUNDAY IN TEBOW'S SPOT. ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE IS THE THING -- AKIN COULD  STILL WIN THIS THING BUT EVEN IF  HE DOES IT WOULD SAY A LOT LESS  ABOUT JESUS-Y HE IS AND A LOT MORE ABOUT HOW (bleep)  MISSOURI S. AMERICANS DON'T VOTE  BASED ON SILLY SIDE ISSUES LIKE  WHETHER YOU HAVE AN EIGHTH GRADE LEVEL GRASP OF FEMALE PRODUCTIVE  SYSTEM. NO WHAT MATTERS IS HOW MUCH YOU  OUT AMERICA.
FEBRUARY 16, 2003. LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALLEN WEST  PREPARE HIS KNOWN GO TO WAR. THAT NIGHT SOUTH BEACH MIAMI. PATRICK MURPHY IS THROWN OUT OF  A CLUB FOR FIGHTING, COVERED IN  ALCOHOL UNABLE TO STAND. TWO MEN A COUNTRY IN CRISIS YOU  DECIDE.
Jon: THE CHOICE IS SO HARD. LET'S SEE ONE IS AN  UNCONTROLLABLE LUNATIC AND THE  OTHER GOT THROWN OUT OF A BAR  ONCE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A  MONOPOLY ON MILITARY VETERANS. DEMOCRAT TAMI DUCKWORTH WHO LOST  HER LEGS IN IRAQ IS RUNNING  AGAINST JOE WALSH. HAS TO TOUGH AGAINST RUNNING  AGAINST SOMEONE WHO SACRIFICED  SO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY.
I BELIEVE SHE TALKS ABOUT HER  SERVICE TOO MUCH. I'M RUNNING AGAINST A WOMAN MY  GOD THAT'S ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT. OUR TRUE HEROS, THE MEN AND  WOMEN WHO SERVED US IT'S THE  LAST THING IN THE WORLD THEY  TALK ABOUT.
Jon: IF YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR  SERVICE YOU ARE NOT A TRUE HERO. I HAVE SOMEONE YOU SHOULD TALK.
Tom: LIEUTENANT COLONEL  ALLEN WEST JUST RECEIVED  DEPLOYMENT ORDERS AND PREPARES  HIS KNOWN GO TO WAR.
Jon: CAN I BE THERE WHEN  YOU TELL HIM HE IS NOT A REAL  HERO. I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO TAKE  THAT SO WELL. HE CAUGHT A LOT OF FLACK FOR  THAT REMARK. HE SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED THE  LESSON. HE TAKES CHEAP PETTY SHOTS ON  THE SERVICE WHEN THERE'S SO MANY  SHOTS YOU CAN TAKE.
TAMI WAS ON A STAGE IN  CHARLOTTE. IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PICTURE  PICKING OUT A DRESS FOR YOUR  SPEECH TUESDAY NIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT DOES THAT DO TO A  PICTURE OF HER PICKING OUT A  DRESS FOR HER CONVENTION SPEECH? [ LAUGHTER ] HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. LOOK. THIS WILL IS HER COMING OUT OF  THE SHOWER IN A ROBE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS SHE DOING IN A ROBE? MOVING OUT OF HER SHOWER. WHAT? LOOK AT IT. I'M NOT THE CRAZY ONE. YOU'RE THE CRAZY ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE, NOT ALL THE PARAGONS  ARE LOCKED IN BATTLES. SOME LIKE GEORGIA CONGRESSMAN  PAUL BROWN ARE RUNNING  UNOPPOSED. WE'LL CHECK IN.
ALL THAT STUFF TALKING ABOUT  EVOLUTION, ALL THAT IS LIES  SCRAIPPED. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS SERGE 9,000  YEARS OLD. I BELIEVE IT'S CREATED IN SIX  DAYS AS WE KNOW THEM. THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, WHO  GIVES A SPEECH IN DEER HELL? [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M NEITHER A HUNTER OR AN  INTERIOR DECORATOR BUT SURELY  THERE'S A HAPPY MEDIUM TO BE HAD  HERE. PERHAPS YOU COULD GET TO STAND  IN FRONT OF SOME OF THE DEER  YOU'VE KILLED AND YET WE STILL  GET TO SEE SOME WALL. AT SOME POINT IT STOPS BEING  HUNTER'S PRIDE AND JUST LOOKS  LIKE ETHNIC CLEANSING. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AT WAR WITH  THE DEER. [ LAUGHTER ] ROUND THEM UP AND SEND THEM TO  DEER COW. [ LAUGHTER ] SECOND OF ALL THE GUY WHO SAID  THE EARTH IS 9,000 YEARS OLD AND  IS CREATED IN SIX LITERAL DAYS  IS RUNNING UNOPPOSED AND SITS ON THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE  AND TECHNOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] DON'T WORRY I'M SURE THERE'S  OTHER PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE  WHO BALANCE HIS VIEWPOINT OUT. LET'S MEET ONE.
IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE RAPE,  THE FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS TO TRY  TO SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN.
Jon: MAGIC VAGINA GUY? ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T A HOUSE  COMMITTEE AGAINST SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY? YOU MIGHT WONDER YOURSELF HOW DL  THOSE (bleep) CRAZY PEOPLE  MAKE IT TO THE NATIONAL STAGE? EASY. THEY DO IT BY LESS CRAZY THAN  THE GUYS ON THE STATE LEVEL.
ARKANSAS STATE REPRESENTATIVE  JOHN HUBBARD SAYS SLAVERY WAS A  BLESSING IN DISGUISE. IT'S IN HIS SELF PUB  LISHED  BOOK. HE SAID HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR  SLAVEY BLACK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE  REMAINED IN AFRICA AND ENJOYED  THE -- NOT ENJOYED THE ADVANTAGES OF LIVING IN AMERICA.
REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WAS  SELF PUBLISHED. CAN'T BELIEVE SIMON AND SCHIEWT  SCHUSTER DIDN'T GRAB THAT GUY. IN THE STATE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES THEY THINK THE  MINI SERIES "ROOTS" SHOULD HAVE  BEEN CALLED "THAN
