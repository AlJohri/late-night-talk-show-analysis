[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A COLUMNIST FOR TIME MAGAZINE PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM STEVEN BRILL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SIR --
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: HAVE A SEAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SO LAST TIME WE WERE TALKING TO YOU, YOU HAD JUST WRITTEN THIS INCREDIBLE ARTICLE FOR TIME MAGAZINE 20 PAGES CALLED BITTER PILL ON THE REAL FINANCIAL CRISIS IN OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM, THE OPAQUE PRICING, THE HOSPITAL PROFITS
THE VERY HIGH PRICES.
Jon: THE VERY HIGH PRICES, EXACTLY. HAS THAT -- HAVE THEY  TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT IN ANY REAL STEPS? WELL THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONS IN OBAMACARE THAT TAKE A STEP TOWARD DOING A LITTLE BIT BUT BASICALLY NO. WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SINCE IS, I'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR A BOOK ABOUT THE WHOLE ROLL OUT OF OBAMACARE AND WHAT IT MEANS. AND NOW I'VE STARTED A SERIES OF COLUMNS IN TIME ABOUT IT. AND WHAT I'M FINDING IS ACTUALLY KIND OF OBVIOUS WHICH IS WHAT OBAMACARE DID WAS IT CREATED A WAY FOR LOTS MORE PEOPLE TO GET INSURANCE PROTECTION, WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT IT DIDN'T CHANGE THE PRICING STRUCTURE, SO THE FIRST PATIENT THAT I WROTE ABOUT WHO I WENT BACK TO WHO NOW HAS OBAMACARE PROTECTION, THIS WAS A MAN WHO HAD TO PAY UP FRONT IN CASH $13,700 FOR A TRANSFUSION OF A CANCER DRUG. HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.
Jon: $13,000 UP FRONT --
$13,700 BUT WHO IS COUNTING.
Jon: $13,700 UP FRONT TO GET A CANCER DRUG.
AS PART OF AN $83,000 UP FRONT BILL JUST FOR HIS INITIAL  TREATMENT. THAT DRUG COST THE DRUG COMPANY APPROXIMATELY $300. THE CEO OF THE DRUG COMPANY MAKES OVER $11 MILLION. NONE OF THAT HAS CHANGED. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE NOW HAS INSURANCE COVERAGE. THERE'S A PREMIUM SUPPORT SYSTEM. BECAUSE HE'S NOT VERY WELL TO DO. THE FAMILY MAKES LESS THAN $40,000 A YEAR WHICH MEANS WE PAY HIS INSURANCE PREMIUM, WE BEING THE TAXPAYERS AND GUESS WHAT THE PRICE OF THE DRUG STILL IS? $13,700.
Jon: THAT HAS NOT CHANGED.
SO THAT HASN'T CHANGED. SO THE COST HAS SHIFTED TO THE TAXPAYERS WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING BUT IT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS THING THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS AND THOSE PROFITS.
Jon: SO BASICALLY THE IDEA IS WHAT THIS NEW SYSTEM DOES IS BRINGS MORE PEOPLE INTO THIS DETERIORATING BUILDING.
THE GOVERNMENT CREATES A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW CUSTOMERS TO GET GOUGED IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
Jon: HOW COME, BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS WAS IT WOULD HELP US WITH PRICE CONTROLS.
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT. THE WAY THEY DEAL WITH PRICE CONTROLS,  FOR EXAMPLE, IS TO HAVE REAL ANTITRUST PROTECTION WHEN HOSPITALS GOBBLE UP OTHER HOSPITALS AND BUY ALL THE DOCTOR'S PRACTICES IT'S TO DO WHAT EVERY OTHER CIVILIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD DOES WHICH IS CONTROL THE PRICE OF A DRUG. YOU LIKE TO COMPARE THE HEALTH CARE MARKET. WELL NOT YOU, BUT EVERYONE SAYS, WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A MARKETPLACE. THAT GUY HAS NO CHOICE ABOUT BUYING THAT DRUG. HIS DOCTOR TOLD HIM THIS WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. YOU DON'T TAKE IT YOU WILL DIE.
Jon: BUT THAT IS THE CONSERVATIVE PUSHBACK ON YOUR ORIGINAL ARGUMENT WHICH IS THAT THE ANSWER HERE IS NOT CONTROLLING IT IT'S ALLOWING COMPETITION. ONE OF THE COLUMNISTS, MAYBE IT WAS GEORGE WILL, SAID IT'S GETTING MORE PEOPLE WITH SKIN IN THE GAME, LETTING THEM KNOW HOW MUCH THEY ARE PAYING FOR THAT CANCER DRUG SO THEY CAN BE SMART CONSUMERS AND GO OH I CAN GET THAT CANCER DRUG FOR LESS AT JIFFY CANCER. >>THAT'S EXACTLY IT.
Jon: THAT'S THE ARGUMENT THEY ARE MAKING.
THAT CANCER DRUG HAS A PATENT. THAT IS A MONOPOLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN THE DRUG COMPANY. IT'S A MONOPOLY. THERE IS NO OTHER DRUG. THAT'S THE DRUG. SECOND, AS I EXPLAINED TO GEORGE WILL ON ANOTHER TELEVISION PROGRAM WAY BACK WHEN, WE TRIED THE EXPERIMENT OF SKIN IN THE GAME. REMEMBER IN THE FIRST ARTICLE, THAT GUY HAD TO PAY THE ENTIRE $83,000 BY TAPPING OUT HIS CREDIT CARDS, HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S CREDIT CARDS. >>Jon: AND HE HAD INSURANCE. HE HAD $83,000 WORTH OF SKIN IN THE GAME AND WHAT GOOD DID IT DO HIM? IT'S NOT LIKE HE WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND SAID, GEE I'D LIKE TO GO SHOP FOR A CANCER DRUG. I WONDER WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND IF I LIKE IT I'LL BUY IT BUT IF I DON'T LIKE IT,  I'LL BUY A PAIR  OF SHOES INSTEAD.
Jon: AT WHAT POINT BECAUSE THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SHOULD FUNCTION AS ONE OF OUR REGULAR UNFETTERED FREE MARKET SYSTEMS BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. YOU TALK ABOUT IN CONNECTICUT THERE ARE MONOPOLIES IN AREAS ON HOSPITALS. THERE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE CANNOT CONTROL, AND WHEN YOU GET SICK, YOU DON'T DECIDE WHERE THE AMBULANCE TAKES YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT. THERE'S NO SEMBLANCE OF A FREE MARKET. WHAT DOES A FREE MARKET USUALLY HAVE? THERE'S USUALLY A BALANCE BETWEEN THE BUYER AND THE  SELLER. THERE IS NO BALANCE. YOU GOTTA BUY THAT PRODUCT. YOU CAN'T GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BUY IT IF YOU ARE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR EVEN IF YOU'RE GOING ANYWHERE IN NEW HAVEN, CT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY HOSPITAL AND THEY OWN ALL THE DOCTORS PRACTICES. THERE'S ALSO IN A FREE MARKET, KNOWLEDGE. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE WHAT TO BUY. YOUR DOCTOR IS TELLING YOU TO BUY THIS. YOUR DOCTOR IS TELLING YOU TO GET THIS CAT SCAN AND THIS MRI PROBABLY AT A HOSPITAL THAT EMPLOYS THAT DOCTOR SO HE HAS AN INCENTIVE TO DO THAT. THERE IS NO FREE MARKET, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT INSISTS ON THE NOTION THAT THERE CAN BE A FREE MARKET. EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TRIED SOMETHING ELSE AND IT WORKS BETTER. THEY GET BETTER HEALTH CARE RESULTS AT A MUCH LOWER COST. THIS ISN'T TERRIBLY CONFUSING.
Jon: I GUESS WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO, THE REAL ISSUE IS THEN WHY DO YOU HATE AMERICA? >>THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] HOW DID YOU KNOW?
Jon: STICK AROUND, BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT--
YOU TALK ABOUT , THE TAXPAYERS ARE NOW SUBSIDIZING THESE NEW INSURANCE PREMIUMS BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING BEFORE WITH THE UNINSURED BEING TREATED IN THESE EMERGENCY ROOMS. SO I JUST WANT TO GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE COME BACK. STEVEN BRILL, BITTER PILL APPEARS IN THE NEW ISSUE OF  TIME MAGAZINE. IT'S A MONTHLY COLUMN. STEVEN BRILL.
