Jon: THAT IS OUR SHOW, JOIN US NEXT WEEK, I WANTED TO TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT AT THE TOP HERE TO THANK YOU GUYS AT HOME. A COUPLE DAYS AGO WE HAD ON AN AUTHOR DAVID MITCHELL WHO HAD TRANSLATED THIS BOOK BY A JAPANESE BOY, 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO HAS AN AUTISTIC SYNDROME. AND HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED THE REASON I JUMP WHICH IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE BOOK I HAVE READ IN AGES. AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT. AND HOW WHAT A GREAT BOOK ITS WITH AND HOW WONDERFUL IT WAS. AND YOU GUYS RESPONDED LIKE CRAZY. YOU DROVE THIS BAD BOY TO NUMBER ONE ON AMAZON, SO FOR DOING THAT, KEEP ON DOING, KEEP ON READING, SPREAD THE WORD. IT'S A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL BOOK. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
