(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! NOW SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED LAST WEEK WE HAD SORT OF AN IMPROMPTU THEME WEEK FOCUSING ON SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE. AND ONE OF ITS PURPORTED SIDE EFFECTS, REMEMBER? THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, LIKE THE POLICE SHOOTING OF TAMIR RICE IN CLEVELAND OR DANTE PARKER IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY OR KENDREC McDADE IN PASADENA OR ARNAND BENNETT IN NEW ORLEANS OR JOHN CRAWFORD-- WHAT TIME DOES COLBERT START? WHAT TIME DOES HIS SHOW START? (LAUGHTER) I'M SO DROLL. NOW AS YOU SAW, ONE OF THESE EXAMPLES THAT WE USED OUT OF MANY CAME FROM SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. NOW THE DA THERE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THIS JON STEWART FELLER'S REPORT.
JON STEWART, HE TALKED ABOUT SHERIFF DEPUTIES SHOOTING DANTE PARKER IN OUR COUNTY. HE WAS SO WRONG ABOUT THOSE FACTS. THEY DID NOT SHOOT HIM, THEY TASERED HIM, AFTER HE HAD COMMITTED A BURGLARY AND HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO ASSAULT A DEPUTY SHERIFF. WE LATER FOUND THAT HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MANY TYPES OF DRUGS, WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH. WE NEED TO GET OUR FACTS STRAIGHT BEFORE WE START MAKING STATEMENTS LIKE THAT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, TWO THINGS. ONE, WHY IS YOUR SET NICER THAN MINE? AND TWO, (LAUGHTER) YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY RAMOS WAS RIGHT. WE WERE WRONG. IN OUR LIST OF UNARMED BLACK MEN SHOT BY POLICE, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE INCLUDED DANTE PARKER WHO, ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER, DIED OF A PCP OVERDOSE. SO I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. (LAUGHTER) I [BLEEP] HATE MAKING UNFORCED ERRORS LIKE THIS. I HATE IT I GET SO MAD AT MYSELF. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID! BECAUSE HERE'S MY GUESS. HERE IS WHY I SO HATE THIS. NOW RATHER THAN HAVING TO HAVE THE UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION ABOUT A JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT MAY BE BIASED OR DISTURBING PATTERN OF UNARMED BLACK MEN BEING SHOT BY POLICE OR A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF MILITARIZATION AND FORCE THAT'S CREPT INTO SOME ASPECTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CULTURE, MY STUPIDITY, MY SLOPPINESS, I DID THIS TO ME, CAN BECOME AN OPPORTUNITY TO NEGATE THAT ENTIRE CONVERSATION. AND SHIFT IT BACK TO SLIGHTLY SAFER, LET'S SAY, LESS NUANCED GROUND.
COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, JON STEWART USES HIS SHOW TO SLAM THE COPS.
Jon: SON OF A BITCH! THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND I CAN'T EVEN FIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AAHH! AND I DESERVE THAT. I DESERVE THAT. THAT'S JUST WHAT I DID WITH THE ONE FACTUAL ERROR THAT IN NO WAY CHANGED THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE OF THE PIECE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I GOT NO ONE TO BLAME BUT ME. PLEASE, SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER?
OUT OF ALL THAT GLIBNESS AND SMUGNESS, DO THE FACTS REALLY MATTER? WELL, EVIDENTLY FOR JON STEWART THEY DON'T REALLY MATTER.
Jon: IT WAS ONE FACT! YOU'RE BEING GLIB AND SMUG AND IGNORING ALL THE FACTS RIGHT NOW! BUT SEE THAT'S WHAT IS SO TOUGH ABOUT WORKING IN MEDIA COUNTER ERRORISM. (LAUGHTER) THE DAILY SHOW-- NO LISTEN TO ME! HEAR ME OUT! THE DAILY SHOW HAS TO BE RIGHT 100% OF THE TIME. FOX ONLY HAS TO BE RIGHT ONCE.  BUT STILL, THIS IS MY FAULT. I DID IT TO ME. I DID IT TO ME. ALL THE STUFF COMING AT ME, I JUST GOT TO ACCEPT IT, BRING IT ON.
IF YOU WANT TO FINE-TUNE COMMUNITY RELATIONS WITH OFFICERS, FINE. BUT NOW IT'S EVERYBODY FEASTING ON YOU GUYS. JUST SO YOU KNOW, JUST TO PUT THESE STATS IN CASE JON STEWART WANTS TO INCLUDE THIS TONIGHT, 85 NYPD OFFICERS WERE KILLED AFTER 9/11.
Jon: [BLEEP] YOU. SERIOUSLY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) [BLEEP] YOU. THAT IS SO FAR OUT OF LINE THAT EVEN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THIS BIT, OSTENSIBLY ACCEPTING BLAME FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS COMING MY WAY FOR THE FACTUAL ERROR I REALLY DO REGRET, [BLEEP] YOU. EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT. IN FACT, IF I HADN'T TOLD YOU TO [BLEEP] OFF I WOULD HAVE HAD TO APOLOGIZE ON TOMORROW'S NIGHT'S SHOW FOR BEING FACTUALLY INCORRECT. BY THE WAY JACK ASS, YOU CAN TRULY GRIEVE FOR EVERY OFFICER WHO HAS BEEN LOST IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN THIS COUNTRY AND STILL BE TROUBLED BY CASES OF POLICE OVERREACH. THOSE TWO IDEAS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. YOU CAN HAVE GREAT REGARD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND STILL WANT THEM TO BE HELD TO HIGH STANDARDS. BUT THE WAY THEY'RE GOING TO TOWN HERE THIS ALL SOUNDS WAY WORSE THAN WHAT I THOUGHT I ACTUALLY EVEN SAID ON THE SHOW. MAYBE I AM MISREMEMBERING IT. MAYBE-- CAN WE ROLL THE CLIP FROM MONDAY AGAIN?
I'M NOT SAYING ALL WE NEED TO DO IS RE-EXAMINE A SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES THESE TYPES OF RESULTS, ALL I'M SAYING IS COPS ARE EVIL. EVERY ONE OF THEM. AND WE MUST BURN THE COUNTRY TO THE GROUND. ANARCHY, ANARCHY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THE CAMERA REALLY DOES ADD A CAPE AND A MUSTACHE. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS THIS, RAISING THESE ISSUES IS NOT THE SAME THING AS DENIGRATING THE POLICE. IT'S A PLEA TO PUSH PAST THE DEFENSIVENESS AND TRY AND GET TO THE REALITY TO MAKE THINGS BETTER, BUT MY GUESS IS THAT AIN'T REALLY HAPPENING, IS IT?
HE TALKS ABOUT A BIGGER PICTURE. THE BIGGER PICTURE FOR ME ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE HONORABLE PROFESSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND HOW THEY'RE BEING ATTACKED IN THIS TIME PERIOD IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Jon: WELL, MR. DA, RESPECTFULLY, I THINK WE DISAGREE. I DON'T THINK SCRUTINY IS THE SAME AS ATTACK. AND WHILE I MAY DISAGREE WITH YOUR POINT OF VIEW, I RESPECT THAT YOU DID GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF PROMOTING MY MOVIE WHILE MAKING IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
