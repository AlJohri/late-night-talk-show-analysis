Jon:  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT'S OUR SHOW. BUT, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THERE'S NOBODY BETTER THAN "THE DAILY SHOW" CREW, THE GUYS THAT PUT THIS SHOW AFFECT THE MEN AND WOMEN TO GET ALL THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT TOGETHER AND BRING IT TO YOU EVERY NIGHT. THREE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE LEAVING US TONIGHT. THEY HAVE BEEN HERE THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE BEEN HERE. APRIL SMITH, DAN BLANK, AND THE GREAT ANDRE ALLEN. THEY'RE MOVING OVER TO "NIGHTLY" TO TAKE ON WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES. WE'RE GOING TO MISS THE HELL OUT OF THEM BUT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON SEEING THEM SO AN ENORMOUS THANKS TO THEM FOR ALL THEIR WONDERFUL YEARS. AND HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
HI, I'M CAROLINE, O'NEILL. NICE TO SEE YOU.
HI CAROLINE O'NEILL. I'M DEAN FINNEGAN'S SON. COME OVER HERE. GOO TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU?
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, MAN, I MAY BE IRISH BUT I'M NOT STUPID.
NO, YOU'RE NOT STUPID.
