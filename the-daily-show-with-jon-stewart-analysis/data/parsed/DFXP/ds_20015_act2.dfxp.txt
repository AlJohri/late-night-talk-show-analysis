Jon: HEY! WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANTED TO TELL YOU, FOR THE PAST COUPLE NIGHTS, FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS, WE HAVE NOTICED, THERE IS A NEW ADVERTISER ON THE "DAILY SHOW" PROGRAM. NO, IT'S NOT ARBY'S. THEY KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY US FOR THEIR NUMEROUS MENTIONS. ( LAUGHTER ) ARBY'S-- FOR WHEN YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IT TASTES LIKE WHEN A COW DIES. ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY, LET'S MEET OUR NEW SPONSOR.
KOCH INDUSTRIES STARTED IN THE HEARTLAND. WE HELP MAKE BETTER FOOD, CLOTHING, SHELTER, TECHNOLOGY, AND OTHER NECESSITIES. WE BUILD ON EACH OTHER'S IDEAS TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. WE ARE KOCH.
Jon:  WOW, THAT'S THE KIND OF AN AD THAT A COMPANY USUALLY MAKES WHEN IT TURNS OUT A BY-PRODUCT OF THEIR MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS GIVING YOUNG PUBESCENT MALES TALKING NIPPLES. BUT YOU KNOW, WHO ARE THESE LOVABLE SCAMP KOCH BROTHERS?
TWO OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST BILLIONAIRES, DAVID KOCH AND HIS BROTHER, CHARLES, CONTROL KOCH INDUSTRIES, A GLOBAL ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING GIANT.
Jon:  SO IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS, KIND A MOM AND POP, SECOND LARGEST PRIVATELY HELD CORPORATION IN THE COUNTRY. THE POINT IS THIS, TWO BROTHERS WORKING TOGETHER, I LIKE THAT-- UNLESS, IT'S OBVIOUSLY,THE THE MENENDEZ BROTHERS, AND THEN IT'S -- THESE ARE NOT THOSE KINDS OF BROTHERS AM I RIGHT?
THEY'VE USE THAT WEALTH TO BACK CONSERVATIVE CAUSES. THE BILLIONAIRE BROTHERS ARE EXPECTED TO SPEND SOME $290 MILLION THESE MIDTERMS, MOSTLY THROUGH THEIR COMPLICATED WEB OF DARK MONEY ORGANIZATIONS.
Jon:  WOW, I CAN SEE WHY THEY WANT TO PORTRAY THEIR PEOPLE AS WORKING IN A SMILE FACTORY OR AS BABY TAILGATERS. ( LAUGHTER ) "IF YOU CAN SMELL THIS, YOU'RE TOO CLOSE. 1-800-HOW'S MY POOPY DIAPER? WOW, SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THE KOCH BROTHER ARE POURING AN UNENDING WATERFALL OF MONEY THROUGH A CLEVERLY MASKED NETWORK OF UNACCOUNTABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO PEDDLE ELECTORAL INFLUENCE, THE AD SOUNDS LESS INSPIRING.
WE'VE EXPANDED TO NEARLY EVERY STATE. TOGETHER, WE ARE KOCH.
Jon:  ALL THOSE WHO AREN'T KOCH WILL BE ASSIGNED TO DISTRICT "B." THE POINT IS, CLEARLY, THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE TRYING TO SAY TO OUR AUDIENCE OF NOT-YET-DYING-OFF VOTERS, EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE HEARD CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT THE KOCH BROTHERS, HOW BAD COULD THEY BE? I MEAN, IF THEY WERE EVIL, WOULD A BABY AGREE TO APPEAR IN ONE OF THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS? ( LAUGHTER ) BUT, OF COURSE, THEIR AD DID LEAVE OUT A COUPLE OF VERY, VERY SMALL POINTS, MOST LIKELY FOR LACK OF TIME. SO TO WELCOME THEM TO THE THE "DAILY SHOW" ADVERTISING FAMILY, WE DID MAKE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.
WE'RE KOCH INDUSTRIES, NOT JUST AN ENERGY COMPANY, WE'RE IN YOUR FOOD, IN YOUR PANTS, AND IN YOUR HOME. AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO MONETIZE YOUR THOUGHTS, WE'LL FIND IT. ALL WHILE BACKING 17 SHADOW ORGANIZATIONS TO BUY ELECTIONS FROM PENNSYLVANIA AVE. TO MAIN STREET. YOU WON'T ALWAYS SEE OUR NAMES ON OUR CAMPAIGN ADS BECAUSE THE POLITICIANS WE OWN SAY THAT'S OKAY. WITH OUR HEARTFELT DEVOTION TO FOSSIL FUELS, WE MAKE YOUR PLANET WARMER, AND YOUR WATER MORE FLAMMABLE, WHILE LUBRICATING YOUR BIRDS, AND REARRANGING YOUR POLAR BEARS. WE CAN'T RAISE YOUR LITTLE GIRL FOR YOU, BUT WE CAN HAND PICK HER SCHOOL BOARD, AND APPROVE HER TEXT BOOKS. AND WHEN SHE LANDS HER FIRST JOB, WE'LL BE FIGHTING TO REDUCE THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT COULD LEAD TO NAZISM. YEAH, NAZISM. WE'RE THAT ( BLEEP ) OUT THERE. WE'RE KOCH INDUSTRIES, THE NEXT GENERATION OF ROBBER BARONS BENDING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO OUR WILL SINCE 1980. OH, AND OUR BROTHER DAVID LIKES BALLET. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
