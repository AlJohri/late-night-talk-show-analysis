Stewart: WE ARE BACK, OUR  GUEST TONIGHT IS AN ASTRO  PHYSICIST AT THE SPACE TELESCOPE  INSTITUTE.
IT IS CALLED BRILLIANT  WONDERS.
COLOSSAL MISS MISTAKES THAT  CHANGED OUR CONCEPT OF LIFE. PLEASE WELCOME MARIO LIVIO!
HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND?
GREAT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THERE  IS NOTHING I LIKE BETTER THAN A  BRILLIANT PHYSICIST. THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE  BOOK F EXPECTATION ABOUT THE  SCIENTIFIC BLUNDER IS ALWAYS THAT STORY OF THE FRENCH GUY WHO  DISCOVERED, YOU KNOW,  RADIOACTIVITY THROUGH LIKE URANIUM OF HIS DESK AND PENS  SILL LYNN BUT THAT IS NOT REALLY  WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT. NO THAT IS SERENDIPITY.
BUT THIS IS NOT THAT. THIS IS BIG SCIENTISTS MAKING  BIG MISTAKES.
Stewart: EXACTLY. AND IT MAKES THEM SEEM. EINSTEIN AND DARWIN, THESE ARE  THE GREATS, THE IDEA ALONG WITH  THEIR BRILLIANT THEORIES THEY HELD STUBBORNLY WRONG BELIEFS.
COMFORTING, ISN'T IT, TO ALL  OF US.
Stewart: WHAT ARE THE  THINGS ABOUT THE WORLD THAT  BOTHERS ME SO MUCH IS HOW MUCH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND HOW WRONG I AM EVERY DAY. AND FROM NOW ON, I AM JUST GOING  TO GO, YEAH, I AM JUST LIKE  DARWIN.
BUT YOU SHOULD SAY, YOU KNOW,  I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT AND,  THEREFORE, I SHOULD KNOW MORE. AND THAT IS THE REAL THING.
Stewart: YOU SAY THESE  BLUNDERS DROVE SCIENTIFIC  DISCOVERY,.
#02: BREAKTHROUGHS, RIGHT,  EVENTUALLY, BECAUSE YOU SEE  THERE IS THIS MISS CON SENSE THAT SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS IS SOME  SORT OF A DIRECT MARCH TO THE  TRUTH. NOTHING REALLY CAN BE FURTHER  FROM THE TRUTH. SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS GOES IN A  ZIGZAG PATH, A LOTS OF BLIND  ALLEYS AND FALSE STARTS AND THAT'S THE MAIN POINT I WANTED  TO MAKE HERE THAT IS HOW IT  GOES.
Stewart: IT IS VERY  INTERESTING AND EVENS SITION  BACK ZIGS BACK.
HE ADDED TO HIS EQUATION, HE  THOUGHT THE UNIVERSE WAS STABLE  BUT HIS EQUATIONS MADE IT SEEM THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SO HE  JUST ADDED SOMETHING IN.
RIGHT. JUST -- YOU SEE, HE THOUGHT --  THAT'S RIGHT, WITH A PENCIL. YOU SEE, HE THOUGHT -- PROBABLY  IN HIS CASE IT WAS A PENCIL.
SO, YOU SEE, HE THOUGHT THAT  THE UNIVERSE WAS STATIC, BUT  THEN HE REALIZED, WAIT A SECOND, BUT THERE IS GRAVITY. EVERYTHING PULLS ON EVERYTHING  ELSE, SO IT SHOULD COLLAPSE,  RIGHT?  IT COULDN'T STAY STATIC, SO IT ENDED LIKE A FUDGE FACTOR,  HE ENTERED ANOTHER TERM THAT  WOULD PRODUCE A REPULSIVE FORCE THAT PRECISELY BALANCED GRAVITY. IT WAS NOT A GOOD IDEA. IT WAS A BIG LIKE BALANCING A  PENCIL ON ITS TIP, BUT, YOU  KNOW, WE THOUGHT THIS WAS IT. THEN AFTER HUBBLE TELESCOPE, HE  DISCOVERED THE UNIVERSE IS  EXPANDING WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING, WAIT A  SECOND IF THE UNIVERSE IS  EXPANDING I DON'T NEED TO BALANCE EVERYTHING LIKE THIS. GRAVITY WILL JUST SLOW DOWN THE  EXPANSION, YOU KNOW, LIKE I TAKE  MY KEYS OUT OF MY POCKET, I THROW THEM UP, GRAVITY OF THE  EARTH SLOWS THEM DOWN, RIGHT?
Stewart: THAT WORKS.
SO FOR THE KEYS, IT DOES. SO HE TOOK THAT TERM OUT OF HIS  EQUATION. NOW GUESS WHAT?  15 YEARS AGO WE  DISCOVERED THAT, IN FACT, OUR  UNIVERSE EXPANSION IS NOT SLOWING DOWN, IT IS SPEEDING UP. IT IS ACCELERATING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS PROPELLING  THIS ACCELERATION?
Stewart: YOUR KEYS?
GOOD TRY. THAT TERM THAT EINSTEIN TOOK OUT  OF HIS EQUATION.
Stewart: YOU GOT TO BE  KIDDING ME SO IT HAS COME BACK  AROUND, HIS ORIGINAL BLUNDER WAS  CORRECT?
WAS A HUGE INSIGHT. SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST SO SMART  THAT THEIR BLUNDERS -- YOU KNOW,  I WISH I COULD MAKE A BLUNDER LIKE THAT.
Stewart: HE IS LIKE A  BRILLIANT MR. MAGOO, LIKE HE  WONDERED INTO IT AND IT IS BRILLIANT AND HE DIDN'T KNOW BUT  LINUS, HE CLUNG TO THIS UNUSUAL  STRUCTURE OF DNA THAT WAS  INCORRECT.
RIGHT.
Stewart: BUT WITHOUT THAT  WE DON'T GET CRICK KEN ROSEN.
YOU KNOW, THEY ADOPTED HIS  WAY OF THINKING, AND HIS METHOD  OF THINKING, BUT HIS MODEL WAS REALLY WRONG, IT WAS BUILT  INSIDE OUT, IT HAS THREE STRANDS  INSTEAD OF TWO, I MEAN HE HAD ALL KIND OF THINGS WRONG WITH IT  AND THIS WAS THE WORLD'S  GREATEST CHEMIST AT THE TIME DOING A MISTAKE LIKE THIS. BUT WHAT HE.
Stewart: BUT HE TRULY  BELIEVED IN IT AS WELL?
YES. YOU SEE, SO, HE HAD SO MUCH  SUCCESS BEFORE SOMETIMES WE ARE  VICTIM OF OUR OWN PREVIOUS  SUCCESS.
Stewart: EXACTLY. YOU THINK YOU CAN GO OFF AND DO  SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN --
Stewart: WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL  ABOUT THIS BOOK IS, FIRST OF  ALL, IT IS VERY NICELY WRITTEN, JUST FUN TO READ, BUT IT GIVES  YOU INSIGHT INTO THE METHODOLOGY  OF BRILLIANCE AND SCIENCE AND IT IS A WONDERFUL THING TO READ. YOU HAVE TO GET THIS, "BRILLIANT  BLUNDERS" ON THE BOOKSHELVES  RIGHT NOW, MARIO LIVIO, THANK
