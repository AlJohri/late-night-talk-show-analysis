FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   WELCOME. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. I'M TELLING YOU, BABY, WE'RE  BACK. TONIGHT IS OUR LAST SHOW BEFORE  WE TAKE A TWO-WEEK BREAK. (LAUGHING)  VERY EXCITED PETER DINKLAGE FROM  GAME OF THRONES, HBO SHOW. A LOT OF NUDITY AND A LOT OF  BEHEADING. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A HAPPY  PASSOVER. I KNOW YOU'RE SETTLING IN FOR  THE PASSOVER BACON, EGG AND  CHEESE SANDWICH. (LAUGHING) IT'S BEEN A WHILE  SINCE I RAN A PROPER SEDER. I'LL TELL YOU WHO KNOW WHAT TO  DO. BARACK OBAMA. LAST WEEK PRESIDENT BARACK  OBAMA, HE MADE HIS FIRST TRIP TO  ISRAEL AS OUR PRESIDENT. OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT HIS FIRST  TRIP TO ISRAEL. HE ALSO, WE KNOW FROM THE  HISTORY CHANNEL, WAS THERE ABOUT  2013 YEARS AGO AS... I DON'T  KNOW. SATAN? OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT WAS IN  ISRAEL TO SHOW THAT HE WAS A  FRIEND TO ISRAEL. CHECKING OUT THE DEAD SEA  SCROLLS AND NAVIGATING THE  AVANT-GARDE RED CARPETS OF THE WEST BANK BUT OF COURSE DANGER  LURKED EVERYWHERE. OH, MY GOD, MR. PRESIDENT! THE ROBOTS. OH, MY GOD! OH, THEY'RE JEWISH ROBOTS. THEY'RE BRINGING HIM SOME FOOD. I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT  THERE, MR. PRESIDENT. GOOD MATZA? THAT'S WHAT'S KNOWN IN THE  BUSINESS AS A GOY TELL BECAUSE  UNLESS IT WAS SLATHERED IN FLUFFER NUTTER OR JAMMED INSIDE  A CHIP-WICH, IT TASTES LIKE THE  BOX IT CAME IN. MATZA SUCKS SO BAD THEY HAD TO  HAVE A ROBOT BRING IT TO HIM. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE A GUEST IN  ISRAEL, YOU WANT TO BE POLITE  BUT YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SAY MATZA SUCKS, TRUST ME. THAT'S WHAT NETANYAHU WAS  THINKING. YOU GIVE MATZA TO A JEW, HERE'S  WHAT THEY THINK. HOW MANY NIGHTS DO WE HAVE TO  EAT THIS [BLEEP]? ANYWAY, GOT TO TAKE MORE THAN  JUST PRETENDING TO LIKE MATZA TO  WIN OVER THIS SKEPTICAL CROWD
SO LONG AS THERE IS A UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA (SPEAKING  HEBREW), YOU ARE NOT ALONE. SNIEM IS THAT WHAT THAT MEANS? TOUCHE OR AS THEY SAY IN ISRAEL,  TOUCHAY. A STUNNING DECLARATION OF  AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL'S  RIGHT TO EXIST. AND IN THE SAME SPEECH...
THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE'S  RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION,  THEIR RIGHT TO JUSTICE MUST ALSO BE RECOGNIZED.   ( APPLAUSE )   JUST AS ISRAELIS BUILT A STATE  IN THEIR HOMELAND, PALESTINIANS  HAVE A RIGHT TO BE A FREE PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN LAND.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT  SKETCHING OUT A PATH TO A  ISRAELI STATE, TO A PALESTINIAN  STATE. WHY DIDN'T NO ONE THINK OF THIS  SOONER?
WE SUPPORT A PALESTINIAN  STATE, ONE THAT IS NEGOTIATED BY  THE PARTIES. ONE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT ISRAEL  HAS GOT A RIGHT TO EXIST.
Jon: SOONER. PALESTINIANS MUST RECOGNIZE  THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL. ISRAEL MUST RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT  OF PALESTINIANS.
Jon: SOONER! IN OUR VIEW, SOMETHING MUST  BE DEVELOPED THAT GIVES THE  PALESTINIANS PEOPLE MEANINGFUL CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN LIVES AND  FATE AND PROVIDES FOR THE  ACCEPTANCE AND SECURITY OF  ISRAEL.
Jon: WE ARE [BLEEP] POWERLESS. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS  IS... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: ... THIS IS REPETITIVE. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS IS  REPETITIVE FOR AMERICAN  PRESIDENTS BUT WATCH THIS. HOLD ON. THAT RIGHT THERE. (MUMBLING) HOLD ON.
IT SEEMS TO ME IF JEWS EVER  GET A STATE IN THE  LaADVANTAGE, ANY ARABS WHO LIVE THERE SHOULD GET ONE TOO. THAT'S EQUITABLE AND FAIR BUT  WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M ONLY THE FATHER OF YOUR  COUNTRY. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE AN  APPOINTMENT INSIDE A STRIPPER'S  G-STRING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: TALK IS CHEAP. WE'VE DONE THAT FOR YEARS. CALL ME WHEN THERE'S ACTUALLY  SOME DIPLOMATIC PROGRESS
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SCORED A  HUGE DIPLOMATIC VICTORY ON THIS  TRIP TODAY.
Jon: WAIT. WHAT? DID MY EARS DECEIVE ME?
HE PERSONALLY HELPED  ORCHESTRATE A MAJOR STEP IN  HEALING THE RIFT BETWEEN TWO CRITICAL U.S. ALLIES.
Jon: COULD IT BE? WHAT WAS IT AN END TO THE SETTLE  MANIES? ROCKET-FREE TUESDAYS?
THE PRESIDENT PERSUADED THE  ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN  NETANYAHU TO APOLOGIZE TO TURKEY OVER MISTAKES THAT LED TO THE  DEATH OF ACTIVISTS ON THE  FLOTILLA.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? OBAMA BROKERED A PEACE AGREEMENT  BETWEEN ISRAEL AND TURKEY, TWO  COUNTRIES NO ONE KNEW WAS  FIGHTING? GEE, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE  DOES WITH BOSNIA AND DENMARK  SITUATION. BUT FOR MORE ON THIS HISTORIC  BREAKTHROUGH WE'RE JOINED BY  SENIOR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT AASIF MANDVI. VERY EXCITING NEWS. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   YOU ARE THERE LIVE IN THE WEST  BANK. WHAT IS THE MOOD LIKE THERE?
WELL, JON, PALESTINIANS HERE  ARE THRILLED WITH THIS IMPORTANT  STEP TOWARDS PEACE
Jon: YES  TO SEE THE HISTORIC  ISRAEL-TURKEY CONFLICT FINALLY  COME TO A PEACEFUL END AFTER THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF  HOURS. I MEAN, THERE ARE COUNTLESS  ISRAELI AND TURKISH  THREE-YEAR-OLDS WHO HAVE NEVER  SEEN PEACE BETWEEN THESE TWO  COUNTRIES. I MEAN, I SPOKE TO ONE  PALESTINIAN WHO SAID, "GOOD FOR  TURKEY. THEY'VE SUFFERED FOR SO LONG."
Jon: I HAVE TO SAY THAT'S  SOMEWHAT SURPRISING
SORRY. I MISREAD THAT. THAT SHOULD HAVE READ, "OH, GOOD  FOR TURKEY. THEY'VE SUFFERED FOR SO LONG."
Jon: THAT MAKES MORE SENSE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   I IMAGINE IN THE PALESTINIAN  AREAS, IN THE PALESTINIAN AREAS, THEY'VE GOT TO BE SOMEWHAT  DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS AND  OBAMA'S TRIP IN GENERAL. MAYBE FEELING NEGLECTED BY IT. EVEN CRUSHED, THEIR SPIRITS  FILLED WITH A NEVER-ENDING  SORROW AND DESPAIR
A FEELING THEY REFER TO HERE  AS TUESDAY.
Jon: MAYBE THEY CAN LOOK AT  IT AS THE JEWS MIGHT WHICH IS  THINK OF THE GREAT HOLIDAY PALESTINIANS ARE GOING TO GET  OUT OF THIS MISERY SOME DAY.
YOU'RE NOT HELPING, JON  Jon: I UNDERSTAND. LOOK, THE ONLY HOPE HERE IS  MAYBE SOMEHOW OBAMA FELT LIKE HE  HAD TO SOLVE THE ISRAEL-TURKEY THING BEFORE HE COULD DIG DOWN  INTO THE SIX-LAYER TURK [BLEEP] THAT IS THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE  PROCESS
Jon: VERY QUICKLY. THE THING IN THE CENTER OF THE  TURK[BLEEP] WAS THAT ULTIMATELY  WHEN THEY GET THE PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD
THAT'S ACTUALLY STUFFING. BUT IF YOU GET THROUGH THAT...
Jon: YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE  OTHER THING. ISRAEL COULD JUST STOP BUILDING  SETTLEMENTS. MAYBE PALESTINE STOPS LAUNCHING  THE ROCKETS. THEY NEGOTIATE A LASTING  TWO-STATE SOLUTION.
(LAUGHING). OH, YOU'RE CUTE, JON. I AM GOING TO MISS YOU THIS  SUMMER.
Jon: THANK YOU. AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
