Jon: WELCOME BACK. SEXISM. DOES IT STILL EXIST? MANY MEN SAY NO. JESSICA WILLIAMS EXPLORES.
PEOPLE COMPLAIN A LOT ABOUT  SEXISM THESE DAYS, BUT  THANKFULLY THERE ARE THOSE WHO  KNOW THE TRUTH.
I'M NOT BUYING THIS  INEQUALITY BUSINESS. I'M NOT.
MEN AND WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT AND WE SHOULD CELEBRATE THAT RATHER THAN CLAIMING WOMEN ARE VICTIMS.
IF ANYTHING IT'S NOT THE WOMEN WHO ARE  VICTIMS, IT'S THE MEN.
IN THIS SORT OF FEMINIZED ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH WE EXIST TODAY, THE OLD FASHIONED TOUGH GUYS ARE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF SLIPPING OUT AND SAYING SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA GET YOU IN TROUBLE AND MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A SEXIST. >>RIGHT, THEY ARE THE ONES IN DANGER, BUT WOMEN ACTUALLY HAVE IT GREAT. LOOK AT ME! I'VE GOT A HIGH POWERED JOB IN NEW YORK, BUT I GET BENEFITS MEN WILL NEVER SEE. COME SPEND A DAY IN MY FUN WORLD. LET'S GO. NOW LET'S TAKE MY WALK TO  WORK. FOR MOST GUYS IT'S JUST A CALM, BORING COMMUTE. BUT FOR ME, IT'S LIKE I'M COMPETING IN A BEAUTY PAGEANT EVERY DAY. DO MEN GET SUPER NICE THINGS  SAID TO THEM WHEN THEY WALK BY  AN OPEN CONSTRUCTION SITE?
HOLA.
HOLA.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M FINE, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD. YOU LOOK GOOD.
THANKS.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
OR WALKING BY A RANDOM SECURITY GUARD ON HIS  LUNCH BREAK.
I LIKE YOUR HAIR.
THANK YOU. YES, I DO HAVE NICE HAIR, MR.  RENT A COP. AND IF I DON'T WANT PEOPLE  TALKING TO ME WHILE I WALK TO  WORK ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GO FOUR BLOCKS NORTH TO AVOID  TEENAGERS HANGING OUT AT THE BODEGA, THREE BLOCKS WEST TO GET AROUND THOSE CREEPY OLD GUYS PLAYING DOMINOS, OH  AND AVOID WALL STREET DOUCHES, WHITE GUYS, LATINO GUYS, BLACK GUYS, MIDDLE EASTERN GUYS, REALLY ANY MEN. AND IT ONLY TAKES 55 MINUTES  TO GET TO WORK. AND LOOK AT HOW MUCH EXERCISE I  GET. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. IS THAT GUY STARING AT MY ASS? THANKS, SIR, THAT'S SWEET. WHOO! HOLLY (BLEEP). HOW COULD ANY WOMEN POSSIBLY  BE BOTHERED BY THIS? INCREDIBLY, I FOUND ONE OR TWO LADIES WHO ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WOAH. ALL RIGHT, LADIES, LET'S HEAR IT.
I THINK IT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE THE VULNERABILITY AS YOU'RE A WOMAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET.
AND I THINK THAT'S THE SCARY PART FOR ME. IT'S I NEVER KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. SHOULD I RESPOND. IS MY SAFETY COMPROMISED IF I MAKE A RESPONSE. IF I CALL THEM OUT.
YOUR SAFETY? GEEZ, LOOSEN UP ALREADY.
THEY MEAN IT IN A NICE WAY,  I THINK.
MOST OF THEM DO, YEAH.
LIKE THEY FIND YOU ATTRACTIVE OR THEY WANT TO JUST PAY A  COMPLIMENT.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I  DIDN'T LIKE IT. IT USED TO BOTHER ME. I THOUGHT LIKE, OH THIS IS SO SEXIST. NOW I'M LIKE, IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN, I'M LIKE, EXCUSE ME.
EXACTLY, YOU SHOULD BE  FLATTERED.
ONE TIME I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND THIS MAN CAME UP LITERALLY INCHES BEHIND ME AND WAS LIKE I WANT TO (BLEEP) YOU IN THE (BLEEP).
WHAT?
A GUY ONCE SAID HE WANTED TO (BLEEP) ON MY TITS AND TAKE A DUMP ON MY BREASTS.
I'M SO SORRY THAT HAPPENED.
BEAUTIFUL IS FINE, BUT BITCH, I WANT TO EAT YOUR (BLEEP). THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY.
AND THE SAD THING IS, THAT GUY WILL PROBABLY BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT STORY. BUT, COME ON, HOW OFTEN DOES THE GROSS STUFF REALLY HAPPEN?
WHERE ARE SOME PLACES ON  THIS MAP THAT YOU HAVE BEEN STREET HARASSED?
SOUTH BRONX.
LONG ISLAND CITY.
DUMBO.
ATLANTIC AVENUE.
BRYANT PARK.
UPPER WEST SIDE.
OH, THAT LEAVES A LOT OF SAFE  PLACES. YOU'LL BE SAFE RIGHT AROUND HERE.
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN HARASSED ON ONE OF THOSE SIGHTSEEING CRUISES.
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YES.
OKAY, FINE. BUT WHOSE FAULT IS ALL THIS  ANYWAY?
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN  RESTRAIN BOYS FROM BEING BOYS. SO THE LONG STARE. THE OFF HAND COMMENT, IT HAVE TO -- WHAT DO YOU DO, EXCUSE  IT? BECAUSE IT WAS CERTAINLY PROVOKED.
OH RIGHT. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST GO OUTSIDE WEARING A DRESS OR PANTS OR A RED SHIRT.
YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET IN A BURQA, YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET IN A BIKINI, IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU'RE STILL GONNA GET HARASSED.
IF YOU MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ANYONE, IT'S LIKE OH, THAT WAS AN INVITATION FOR YOU TO SAY SOMETHING OR LOOK AT ME TOO LONG.
WOAH, WOAH, MAKE EYE CONTACT? LADIES, YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT  WALKING DOWN THE STREET THE  RIGHT WAY. RULE NUMBER ONE, ALWAYS WEAR  OVERSIZED HEADPHONES. RULE NUMBER TWO, MASTER THE FAKE PHONE CALL.
HELLO. BEYONCE?
RULE NUMBER THREE, AVOID EYE  CONTACT AT ALL COSTS. KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN FOR THE  LOVE OF -- OH (BLEEP) AND THERE'S TONS OF OTHER FUN  SOLUTIONS TOO.
MY NORMAL RESPONSE IS JUST PUT ON MY BITCH FACE, AND JUST WALK STRAIGHT AHEAD, COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM.
DO YOU GUYS ALL HAVE A BITCH FACE?
I DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH YOU.
BUT IF YOU REALLY NEED TO GET  SOMEWHERE, THERE ARE THINGS  YOU CAN DO. ♪YOU'RE A GRAND OLD FLAG. YOU'RE A HIGH FLYING FLAG. ♪ AND FOREVER IN PEACE MAY YOU SWAY.
LIKE ACT LIKE A PSYCHO.
♪ YOU'RE THE EMBLEM OF
OR FOR REAL SAFETY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET A TRAVEL BUDDY. THE MORE THE BETTER.
WHO LIVES ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE? LET'S GO.
WHO NEEDS TO STOP AT A BODAGA ON THE WAY HOME?
DOES ANYONE LIVE IN  WILLIAMSBURG? ANYONE? WE'VE GOT TWO IN WILLIAMSBURG.
IT SEEMS WE CAN ONLY DREAM OF THE DAY WHEN WOMEN CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET AND CONFIDENTLY SAY, SAY IT WITH ME.
SIR, IT IS NOT OKAY FOR YOU TO SAY THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE A (BLEEP) ON MY TITS AND A DUMP ON MY BREASTS, ALSO, THAT'S REDUNDANT.
