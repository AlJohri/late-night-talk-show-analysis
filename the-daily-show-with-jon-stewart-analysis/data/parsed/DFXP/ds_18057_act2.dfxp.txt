[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BOOM! WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BIG NEWS FROM ACROSS THE UPON  THE, THE COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE A  SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH JUST HAD AN HISTORIC VOTE IN SPECIAL  RELATIONS.
NOW TO GAY MARRIAGE, AN ISSUE  HAS FUELED CONTROVERSY IN MANY  COUNTRIES. TODAY IT WAS BRITISH LAWMAKERS  WHO ENTERED THE DEBATE. THE HOUSE OF COMMONS VOTED  OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF  LEGALIZATION.
THE AYES TO THE RIGHT 400,  THE NOS TO THE LEFT 175. THE AYES HAVE IT. THE AYES HAVE IT.
Jon: 50 POINTS TO  GRIFFINDOR. EVEN WHEN THE UK IS EXTENDING  CIVIL RIGHTS BEYOND THE WHAT WE  DO IN THIS COUNTRY THEY DO IT BY YELLING A GOLDEN SCENTER. LOSING THE 18th CENTURY WIG,  TOO SOON, GAY MARRIAGE, BRING IT  ON. THE VOTE WASN'T EVEN SPLIT ALONG  PARTY LINES.
BEHIND THAT BIG MAJORITY A  BIG TORREY SPLIT. 126 SUPPORTED PROPOSAL BUT MORE  136 WERE AGAINST AND 41 MORE  COULDN'T BE PERSUADED TO VOTE WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND AND  TAINED.
Jon: ABSTINENCE IS THE ONLY  100% EFFECTIVE METHOD OF NOT  GETTING BLAMED FOR (bleep). IT WENT ON FOR FIVE YEARS. LET'S FLARE A SUPPORTER.
IT'S ALSO TIME TO TAKE THE  NEXT STEP FOR EQUALITY, ALLOW  GAY AND LESBIANS THE CHANCE TO MAR YEAH IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO.
Jon: NO YOU DIDN'T. EQUALITY (bleep) YOU JUST  THREW DOWN. YOU BROUGHT A STEAMG TEA POT OF  EARL TEA ON YOUR HEAD. LET'S HEAR THE OPPOSITION.
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THIS  COUNTRY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH. IT'S IRRELEVANT AND SHOULD NOT  BE PURSUED THROUGH THE HOUSE.
Jon: THAT'S IT THEN? WE'RE BUSY AT THE MOMENT, NO? MY BROTHER THAT IS NOT HOW THE  STEM THE RISING TIED OF CIVIL  RIGHTS. THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE HAS  BEEN WEAKENED IN THIS COUNTRY. IT'S HARMFUL TO THE END OF THE  REPUBLIC.
Jon: THAT'S THE END OF  WORLD VIBE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. GIVE IT ANOTHER AGO.
MIXED SEX MARRIAGED HAVE  DECREASED CONSIDERABLY IN THE  NETHERLANDS.
Jon: THAT'S YOUR ARGUMENT. WHO GIVES A (bleep) EXCEPT FOR  FANS OF MY BIG FAT DUTCH  WEDDING. YOU KNOW WHAT IS MISS SOMETHING  IN YOU NEED AN ALL-POWER BEING  INVOKED.
SEVERAL MILLENNIA AGO THE  WORDS WERE WRITTEN A MAN SHOULD  CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE. I WASN'T OUR IDEA, IT WAS GOD'S  IDEA.
Jon: YEAH, YOU GOTTA LOVE  CLEAVING, MAN. THERE WAS A GIRL I WANT TO  CLEAVE THE (bleep) OUT OF IT. SHE ENDED UP CLEAVING THE  CAPTAIN OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM AND  I ENDED UP CLEAVING MYSELF. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN? OH, RIGHT. LOOK TORREYS I KNOW THE STAKES  ARE LOWER OVER THERE BECAUSE  BRITAIN DOESN'T HAVE HURRICANES EVERY TIME TWO DUDES KISS BUT  TRY IT ONCE MORE. THIS TIME PUT SOME FEELING INTO  IT.
I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THE BILL  ALTHOUGH ON BALANCE I ACCEPT THE  FACT THAT EVIDENCE FROM THE POLLS PROBABLY INDICATE THERE'S  A MAJORITY IN THE COUNTRY WHO  FAVOR THE CHANGE.
Jon: 100 POINTS FROM  HUFFLEPUFF. YOU CALL YOURSELVES  CONSERVATIVE. NOT ONE MENTION OF THE SLIPPERY  SLOPE OF THE PEDOPHILE ORGIES.
IT COULD BE BETWEEN ANY TEN  PEOPLE.
IF IT'S BASED ON LOVE, IT  OKAY TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE MARY.
WHY NOT ALLOW AN URCHG TOLL  MARRY HIS NIECE.
IF YOU HAD A SECTION FOR YOUR  HORSE, I GUESS COULD YOU BURY  YOUR HORSE.
Jon: AND THEN YOU AND YOUR  HORSE COULD MAKE A SUPER BOWL  COMMERCIAL TOGETHER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, WASN'T ANYONE IN  PARLIAMENT WILLING TO TAKE THEM  TO CRAZYTOWN.
YOU ARE A MISERABLE [YELLING]
Jon: THANK YOU! THAT'S WHAT WE -- WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S NOT FROM THE SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE DEBATE. THAT'S THE DEBATE OVER A  MISHANDLING OF A CLASSROOM  BUILDING. IT'S ALMOST AS IF BRITISH  CONSERVATIVES WANTED GAY  MARRIAGE TO PASS. I KNOW WHY THE ONLY THING MORE  FABULOUS THAN A ROYAL WE HADDING  IS A GAY ROYAL WEDDING.
