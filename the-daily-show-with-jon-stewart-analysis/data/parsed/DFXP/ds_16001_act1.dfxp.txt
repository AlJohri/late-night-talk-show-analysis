[LAUGHTER] JOEY, WITH A Y. [LAUGHTER] THE Y IS WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT? [LAUGHTER] EVERY YEAR ONE OF OUR 50 STATES EMERGES AS THE LEADING EXPERTOR AS ABSOLUTE BAT (bleep) INSANITY. FLORIDA DOMINATED THE FIELD IN THE EARLY --  [LAUGHTER] YES, YOU'RE WELCOME. ARIZONA, NEW JERSEY ALWAYS STRONG CONTENDERS. LAST YEAR SOUTH CAROLINA, LET'S FACE IT, RAN AWAY WITH IT. [LAUGHTER] NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR GOVERNOR, NOT BECAUSE OF CRACKPOT STATE LEGISLATURE, NOT BECAUSE OF ONE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SEXUAL  RELATIONS WITH A HORSE --  [LAUGHTER] -- BUT BECAUSE THAT GENTLEMAN WENT BACK MONTHS LATER FOR SEX WITH THE SAME HORSE. Ak[Eï¿½ï¿½]9UQ)]]OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY THE SO CAROLINA SPIN TO THAT WITH BE  I'M IN SOUTH CAROLINA WITH THE WORLD'S MOST ATTRACTIVE HOUSE. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT'S 2011. IT'S A REBOOT. FIELD IS WIDE OPEN THIS YEENCH ARKANSAS WILDLIFE OFFICIALS ARE PRETTY STUMPED AFTER THOUSANDS  OF BIRDS DROPPED DEAD FROM THE ARKANSAS SKIES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I HOPE NO ONE (bleep)ED THEM OUT OF SKY. [LAUGHTER] NATURAL PHENOMENON OR PERHAPS MURDER? [SCARE SCARY MUSIC PLAYING] IT SEEMS BIRDS OF A FEATER DIE TOGETHER. ♪ ♪ YES. [LAUGHTER] MASTERS OF ARKANSAS -- MASSIVE ARKANSAS BIRDS FALLING FROM THE SKY. IT'S A START FOR THE OPENING CRAZY STATE SWEEPSTAKES.
A 20 MILE STRETCH OF ARKANSAS RIVER WAS BLANKETED WITH 100,000 DEAD DRUM FISH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. NOW YOU ARE MOVING FROM CRAZIEST STATE STORY TO SIGN OF THE APOCAL IF ANYONE WANTS TO BEAT ARKANSAS  THIS YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE TUX SOUTH CAROLINA I HAVE ONE WORD TO SAY TO YOU [WHINNIES] WE'VE BEEN AWAY TWO WEEKS TIMING THE BREAK WITH THE HOLIDAY NEWS LULL. WE WON'T BLOW OUT OF TOWN WHEN IMPORTANT (bleep) IS GOING DOWN. WE'RE NOT THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. OH, YEAH, I'M WRONG. WHERE DID WE LEAVE? WE WERE RIDICULING THE DEMOCRATS. WE WERE NOT ALONE.
THE OBAMA AGENDA IS DEAD.
65 SEATS TURNED OVER IN THE HOUSE HAS PUT A NAIL IN THE PRESIDENT'S COFFIN.
OBAMA IS IN TROUBLE.
THERE'S NO HOPE FOR OBAMA.
INCAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING OF ANY SIGNIFICANT  SUCCESS, THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA IS DEAD.
AHHH. NO-BAMA. THE AUDACITY OF DOPE. DREAMS FROM MY ASS. [LAUGHTER]
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MOCK THAT ONE UP? YOU ARE NOT GOING TO -- OF COURSE, THEN I WENT AWAY TO MY WINTER HOME ON THREE WEEKS  BEHIND ISLAND ON THE -- COULD HAVE THE COAT OF PUERTO FAKE-O. I THOUGHT I WOULD LOOK ON AIR TO MAKE IT MORE OF A SPECTACLE.
TAX SHIELD TO PROTECT THE UNEMPLOYED.
THE 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS BILL.
THE REPEAL OF DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.
THE OVERHAUL OF FOOD SAFETY LAWS.
ALONG WITH THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TREATY WITH RUSSIA.
DID QUITE WELL.
Jon: HOLY CRAP-O DEMOCRATS YOU NEED TO LOSE MID TERM ELECTIONS MORE OFTEN. IT SUITS YOU. IF YOU COMPLETELY LOSE THE SENATE WE COULD SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM. [LAUGHTER] THE PRONUNCIATIONS OF A ADMINISTRATION'S DEMISE FOLLOWED BY A MULTITUDE OF POLITICAL  VICTORIES THE SCANDALS MUST BE -- THIS CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING TO THE COIN-PHRASE-O-METER.
PRESIDENT IS THE COMEBACK KID.
IS HE THE COMEBACK KID?
HE IS THE COMEBACK KID.
COMEBACK KID.
Jon: YOU WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO SAID HE WAS DEAD. THE MEDIA IS THE WORLD'S WORST PARAMEDIC. THEY DECLARE PEOPLE DEAD WHEN THEY ARE NAPPING SO, OF COURSE, WAKING UP MUST BE A MIRACLE. OBAMA IS NOT THE COMEBACK KID. IT'S JUST A RIGHT TO WAY OF -- TRITE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. HE'S LUKE SKYWALKER. COME WHDH ME TO THE PREMISE MOBILE. IT STARTED A LONG TIME WHEN A SKINNY KID WITH A FUNNY NAME CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND AGAINST  ALL ODDS.
BARACK OBAMA CANNOT CLOSE THE DEAL.
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
Jon: HE DEIFIED OUTRAGEOUS ODDS TO -- DEIFIED OUTRAGEOUS ODDS TO WIN THE ELECTION. HE WON THE ELECTION AND THE HEARS OF THE PEOPLE. ♪ ♪ -- HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] ♪ ♪ OH (bleep) BIDEN IS THERE ANY MOMENT YOU CAN'T RUIN? [LAUGHTER] THE PRESIDENT TAKES POWER, ENJOYS THE TRAPPINGS OF OFFICE, INVITE HIS FAVORITE MUSICIANS OVER TO ENTERTAINMENT HIM. STEVIE WONDER HAS NO IDEA HOW WEIRD HIS BAND LOOKS. [LAUGHTER] MEANWHILE, THE REPUBLIC-KIN EMPIRE GROWS STRONGER. NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE SECOND MOVIE WHICH IS REALLY MOVIE FIVE. THE PRESIDENT FINDS HIS EFFORTS TO CLOSE GUANTANAMO BAY STIFLED. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS STAGNANT P. EFFORTS TO SHUT DOWN AN OIL SPILL ARE BUNGLED WHILE A  FIERCE POTENTIAL RIVAL STALKS HIM FROM ALASKA. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY THAT'S --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THAT'S FROM THE REALITY SHOW. I BELIEVE THAT IS FROM THE|ï¿½ REALITY SHOW SARAH PALIN'S SHE CLAIMS SHE CAN SEE TATUINE FROM  HER HOUSE. NERD SLAM! BOOM! I'M SLOWLY LOSING AUDIENCE SHARE. [LAUGHTER] IT ALL CULMINATES IN A CRUSHING MID TERM ELECTION DEFEAT AND MAKING OUT WITH HIS OWN SISTER  CAN'T EASE THE PAIN. IT'S NOT A PERFECT ANALOGY. SO --  [LAUGHTER] TO COMPLETE THE THE TRILOGY, BARACK OBAMA HEADS OFF TO WORK OUT A COMPROMISE AFTER REPUBLICANS DECLARE THEY'LL DO  NOTHING UNLESS TAX CUTS ARE EXTENDED. CALM DOWN CHRIS MATTHEWS HE IS TRYING TO BE BIPARTISAN. AGAINST ALL ODDS THE DEMOCRATS MANAGE TO DEFEAT AN INCREDIBLY WELL ARMED AND WELL OILED  MACHINES USING STONE, BIND AND A WELL PLACED LOG. THEY GAINED SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES. ♪ ♪ CLEARLY, I BELIEVE, THAT WAS THEM CELEBRATING AFTER DON'T  ASK, DON'T TELL WAS REPEALED. [LAUGHTER] AND SO -- AND SO OUR HEROS RIDE OFF INTO THE SUNSET. NOTHING ELSE IN THE WAY.
WHILE THE OBAMA'S VACATIONED IN HAWAII THE STATE'S GOVERNOR  IS DIVING INTO THE CONTROVERSY OVER WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS BORN.
Jon: PREQUEL, DAMMIT. MEESA SEEN HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE
