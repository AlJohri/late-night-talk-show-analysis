FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE  "DAILY SHOW."  WHAT A GOOD ONE WE HAVE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ALAN  SIMPSON-- ONE-THIRD OF THE  SINGING TRIO "ASHFORD AND  SIMPSON AND BOWLES" ( LAUGHTER )  YOU SHOULD NOT GET THEIR ALBUM. THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH  AMERICA. IT'S GREAT! AND REPUBLICANS IN THE UNITED  STATES SENATE THINK IT'S ABOUT  TIME AMERICA CAFTA, SIDE IT'S FAMED HUMILITY AND LET THE WORLD  SEE THE AWESOMENESS THAT IS US.
THE NATION AND THE WORLD NEED  STRONG AMERICAN LEADERSHIP.
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD  THE WORLD.
WE WANTED OUR EXAMPLE TO  INSPIRE THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH.
THEY'RE WAITING FOR AMERICA  TO LEAD THE WAY.
WE ARE AS A NATION A BEACON  OF HOPE FOR MANY ACROSS THE  GLOBE.
WE'VE CREATED A BEACON OF  HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE  REST OF THE WORLD.
Jon:  A BEACON OF HOPE. A HOME BEACON, A-- COME ON,  WORLD! FOLLOW OUR LEADERSHIP. DID YOU HEAR ME, WORLD? COME ON, FOLLOW! ( LAUGHTER )  DON'T MAKE ME SEND IN THE  ( BLEEP ) DRONES. GET BEHIND US. COME ON! ( LAUGHTER )  I WILL RAIN DOWN HELLFIRE! ( LAUGHTER )  ACTUALLY THIS WEEK PRESENTED  AMERICA WITH JUST THAT KIND OF  LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITY.
THERE'S A SENATE VOTE  TOMORROW ON A UNITED NATIONS  DISABILITIES TREATY.
ADVOCATES SAY THE UNITED  NATIONS TREATY APPROVED BY 126  COUNTRIES, WOULD PROMOTE EQUAL RIGHTS AND BETTER TREATMENT FOR  THE DISABLED INSPIRED BY U.S. LAW, THE AMERICANS WITH  STABILITIES ACT.
Jon:  YOU'RE WELCOME. ( LAUGHTER ). ONCE AGAIN, AMERICA'S EXAMPLE  HAS BECOME THE STANDARD FOR  OTHER NATIONS TO FOLLOW. WE CAN BE THAT SHINING CITY ON  THE HILL. AS LONG AS THAT HILL HAS A RAMP. ( LAUGHTER )  IF-- I THINK IT'S VERY POLITE OF  THE UNITED STATES. IF YEAR GOING TO CREATE CERTAIN  DISABILITIES WITHIN YOUR  COUNTRY, WELL... ( LAUGHTER )  MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SOME STANDARD  TREATMENT FOR SAID INJURIES. SO, UNASSAILABLE AND UNIIFYING,  THIS PROPOSAL COULD NOT BE  MATCHED. FORMER REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADER  AND WORLD WAR II VETERAN BOB  DOLE CAME OUT OF RETIREMENT TO PERSONALLY ENDORSE THIS  PROBABLY. EVEN CURRENT SENATE RIFLES MAIN  AND JOHN KERRY PUT ASIDE THEIR  DIFFERENCES FOR IT.
SENATOR McCAIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,  MR. SECRETARY.
Jon:  HUH? A LITTLE GOOD-NATURED RIBBING. I'M SURE SENATOR KERRY HAD A  GOOD COMEBACK. "WHAT YOU JUST SAW WAS SENATOR  McCAIN REFERRING NOT TO ME  WITH MY CURRENT TITLE THE RIGHT HONORABLE SENATOR FROM THE GREAT  STATE OF... MASSACHUSETTS, BUT SENATOR  McCAIN HAS REFERRED TO ME WAY  TITLE PROSPECTUS, MR. SECRETARY, REFERENCEs SENATOR McCAIN'S  OBSTINNENCE WITH REGARD TO SUSAN  RICE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN MY ASCENSION TO THE CABINET  POSITION HELD BY SUCH LUMINARIES  THROUGHOUT HISTORY AS SIEWRD, ACHISON, VANCE, AND, OF COURSE,  OTHERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT--"  ( LAUGHTER )  ISN'T THAT HOW YOU HAMMED THAT THERE, SENATOR KERRY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,  MR. PRESIDENT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  BAM! BA-BAM! LAUGH LATCH  TWO THINGS.( LAUGHTER )  ONE, SOLID, CONCISE JOKE. TWO, A LITTLE DISPROPORTIONATE  ( LAUGHTER )  McCAIN TEASED YOU ABOUT A JOB  YOU MIGHT GET. AND YOU HIT HIM WITH THE FAILURE  OF HIS LIFE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  IT'S LIKE-- IT'S LIKE McCAIN  NUDGED HIM IN THE RIBS. MAKIN NUDGED KERRY IN THE RIBS. MR. SECRETARY-- KERRY TURNED  AROUND AND STABBED HIM IN THE  FACE. I CAN SEE WHY THAT GUIDE GOOI  WOULD MAKE A GREAT CHIEF  DIPLOMAT. YOU KNOW WHAT, FINALLY, A  RIGHTEOUS MISSION OF WORLDWIDE  EQUAL RIGHTS FOR THE DISABLED WITH THE SUPPORT OF WAR HEROES  AND SENATE ELDER STATE MEN IN A  WORLD GONE MAD, AMERICAN CAN LEAD AND RESCHAIM ITS  EXCEPTIONAL MORAL AUTHORITY.
THEY NEEDED 66 VOTES. IT'S A TREATY, TWO-THIRD OF THE  SENATE AND IT FAILED.
Jon:  ( BLEEP ). HOW DID THAT FAIL! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR OW NEW  SEGMENT, "PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS  ROCK BOTTOM."  ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
38 REPUBLICANS VOTED NO.
TO VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT IS  EVEN PERCEIVED TO BE GRANTING  THE U.N. POWER IS A DANGEROUS GAME FOR A REPUBLICAN SENATOR  BECAUSE THE U.N. IS SO UNPOPULAR  AMONG THE REPUBLICAN BASE.
Jon:  OH, MY GOD. ( LAUGHTER ). IT'S OFFICIAL-- REPUBLICANS HATE  THE UNITED NATIONS MORE THAN  THEY LIKE HELPING PEOPLE IN  WHEELCHAIRS. ( LAUGHTER )  LOOK, I'M WILLING TO KEEP AN  OPEN MIND HERE. WHAT ARE YOUR ( BLEEP ) REASONS  FOR OPPOSING THIS?
WE ALREADY HAVE THE MOST  COMPREHENSIVE DISABILITY RIGHTS  LAWS AND PROTECTIONS IN THE  WORLD. PERIOD.
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE  GOLD STANDARD FOR THE DISABLED.
Jon:  RIGHT. SO BY SIGNING THIS, WE ARE,  THROUGH OUR MORAL LEADERSHIP AND  HOPE BEACONING, ENCOURAGES THE OTHER SIGNATORIES IN THE WORLD  TO LIVE UP TO THE ONLY STANDARD  THAT NEVER LOSES VALUE... GOLD. ( LAUGHTER ). I DON'T GET IT. IT CAN'T JUST BE YOU REJECT  TRYING TO GET OTHER COUNTRIES TO  LIVE UP TO AMERICA'S IDEALS. THAT CAN'T BE IT. SHOW US SOMETHING ELSE, MAYBE  NAY SIZE CRAZY.
IT'S WITH GRAVE CONCERN FOR  SOVEREIGNTY THAT I OPPOSE THIS  U.N. TREATY.
THE TREATY COULD BE USED TO  INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY OF  PARENTS WITH DISABLED CHILDREN TO DECIDE WHAT ACTION IS IN THE  BEST INTEREST OF THEIR CHILDREN. THIS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY--  AFFECT THOSE PARENTS WHO HOME  SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YEAH, THAT'S--  THAT'S THE STUFF. THAT'S THE STUFF. YOU VOTED NO BECAUSE YOUR FEAR  IS IF WE SIGN ON TO A TREATY  THAT IS ONLY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED DISABILITY STANDARDS,  STANDARDS WE MADE THE LAW OF THE  LAND 20 YEARS AGO, WHAT'S TO STOP THE MEN IN BLUE HELMETS  FROM STORMING INTO YOUR LIVING  ROOM-- I'M SORRY, SCHOOL-- AND FORCE YOU TO BUILD A  WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE RAMP TO  THE CAFETERIA-- I'M SORRY, YOUR  KITCHEN. ( LAUGHTER )  OR THAT ADAM AND EVE DIDN'T RIDE  A STEGGASAURUS. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU  OBJECT TO IN THIS  BOB-DOLE-SUPPORTED TREATY THAT  WILL FORCE AMERICANS TO BOW DOWN TO THE U.N.?
THIS TREATY SIMPLY HAS NO  ENFORCEMENT MECHISM.
Jon:  MOTHER ( BLEEP )! ( LAUGHTER )  BOY, THE U.N. REALLY THOUGHT OF  EVERYTHING. AN ALL-POWERFUL, ONE-WORLD  TREATY WITH NO ENFORCEMENT  MECHANISM. LIKE ONE OF THEM CHINESE  FINGERED TRAPS. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS RELAX YOUR  FINGERS AND I'M FREE! HOW ABOUT THIS? HOW ABOUT WE CHANGE THE TREATY  TO INCLUDE A CLASSIFICATION OF  DELUSIONAL PARANOIA AS A  DISABILITY. ( LAUGHTER )  SO NOW THAT YOU'LL BE COVERED,  ARE WE GOOD? ( SCREAMING )  THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE SENATE  STILL SAY NAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
