FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, RORY KENNEDY WILL BE JOINING US. SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE FILM, A GREAT DOCUMENTARY, "LAST DAYS IN VIETNAM." AND WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY, WE LOSE. WE LOSE. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST, FAMOUS NAUGHTY BITS.
THE F.B.I. IS INVESTIGATING THE PHOTO HACKING THAT TARGETED HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES.
DOZENS OF NUDE AND RISQUE PHOTOS POSTED.
THIS TARGETED EVERYONE FROM AN OSCAR WINNER TO MUSIC SUPERSTARS AND MODELS.
Jon: NO STAR WAS OFF LIMITS. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] THOSE WERE PERSONAL PICTURES THAT SHE TOOK FOR TRAMP'S BIRTHDAY, AND I FOR ONE AM UPSET. HOW THE HELL DID A HACKER STEAL PRIVATE PHOTOGRAPHS? TO FIND OUT HOW THIS WAS DONE, YOU GOTTA GO TO THE EXPERTS.
NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHO DID THIS OR EXACTLY HOW THOSE PHOTOS WERE OBTAINED.
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO HACKED THE PHOTOS.
WHO UPLOADED THOSE PHOTOS.
WHO POSTED THE PHOTOS?
WE KNOW THAT THE DATA MADE IT ON TO PHONES, AND WE KNOW THE PHONES STORED THE PHOTOGRAPHS. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THEN WHY ARE YOU ON MY TELEVISION? ONCE AGAIN I LEAVE WATCHING THE NEWS SOMEHOW KNOWING LESS THAN WHEN I STARTED. SO EVEN THE EXPERTS CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW THIS HAPPENED, BUT ONE COMPANY IS ALREADY TAKING AN AWFUL LOT OF HEAT.
DATA HIDDEN WITHIN THE FILES REVEALS MOST OF THE IMAGES WERE TAKE WITHIN AN APPLE iPHONE, WHICH IS WHY THE COMPANY'S POPULAR ONLINE BACK-UP SERVICE ICLOUD CAME UNDER INSTANT SCRUTINY.
Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT SOMETHING NAMED AFTER WHAT APPEARS FIRM AND STABLE BUT IS REALLY JUST A MASS OF WATER VAPOR MIGHT PROVIDE ONLY THE ILLUSION OF SECURITY. [LAUGHTER] INTERESTING. SO WHAT'S THE TAKEAWAY HERE? BETTER SECURITY IN THE CLOUD? YOUR TWO-STEP VERIFICATIONS THERE OR MAYBE SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW BLAMIER?
IF YOU DON'T WANT NUDE PICTURES OF YOURSELF TO APPEAR TO THE WORLD, DON'T TAKE THE NUDE PICTURES IN THE FIRST PLACE.
DON'T TAKE PICTURES OF YOURSELF WITH YOUR GOODS AND YOUR FACE.
DON'T TAKE NUDE PHOTOS.
TAKING PICTURES OF THEMSELVES NAKED, I'M JUST SORT OF STUCK ON THAT. WHY? WHY?
Jon: YES. WHY? WHY WOULD A HUMAN BEING WANT TO LOOK AT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING'S NAKED BODY? IT MAKES NO SENSE. AND WHY, WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE WHERE THEY GO TO THE BATHROOM? [LAUGHTER] WHY DO PEOPLE DO THAT? I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH JUST WORKING ALL THE TIME? I JUST WANT TO WORK AND TAKE KLONOPIN AND JUST HOPE IT ALL GOES AWAY. THAT'S FROM MY ONE-MAN SHOW. [LAUGHTER] JONNY IS ASHAMED. BUT I GET IT. THESE WOMEN WERE ASKING FOR IT. IT'S LIKE THEY SAID TO THE BOSTON STRANGLER'S VICTIMS, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET STRANGLED, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD A NECK. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO TAKE PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES DOING WHATEVER INTIMATE THINGS THEY WANT FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE ENJOYMENT WITH THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT THE INTERNET WILL NOT MAKE THEIR NIPPLES THE NEXT DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK. WHO BY THE WAY IS ACTUALLY A PRAIRIE DOG. I WANTED TO GET THAT OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S A PRAIRIE DOG. HE WAS KNOWN AS THE DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK. THE TRUTH IS HE'S A PRAIRIE DOG. I'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME TO SAY THAT. [LAUGHTER] NOW I GOT NOTHING LEFT THE LOOK FORWARD TO. THE POINT IS ACCORDING TO THESE PEOPLE, THE LAWS COVERING PRIVATE PROPERTY AND STEALING ARE SOMEHOW NULL AND VOID WHEN IT COMES TO RECREATIONAL NUDITY.
IT'S THE SAME THING THAT PARENTS KEEP THEIR KIDS ABOUT SEXTING. YOU DON'T TAKE PICTURES AND SEND THEM TO SOMEBODY AND EXPECT THEM NOT TO SHARE THEM WITH ANYBODY.
Jon: THESE PICTURES WEREN'T SHARED! THESE ARE PICTURES OF THEIR PRIVATE PARTS. THEY WERE PASSWORD PROTECTED. THAT IS SAFER THAN EVEN PEOPLE'S PANTS WHERE PEOPLE KEEP THEIR MONEY AND KEYS AND THEIR ACTUAL PENII AND VAGINI. AND BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE BLAMING THE CURRENT GENERATION FOR ALL THIS, IT'S NOT LIKE STEVE JOBS INVENTED THE NUDE PORTRAIT. iPHONES AND THE INTERNET ARE JUST A MORE EFFICIENT NUDITY DELIVERING MECHANISM. IN FACT, LET ME GIVE YOU MY IMPRESSION. HERE WE GO. THIS IS MY IMPRESSION OF, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, LIKE THE INVENTOR OF THE POLAROID HERE. LET ME JUST, HOLD ON. TEN SECONDS AFTER INVENTING THE POLAROID, HERE'S MY IMPRESSION. OH, THAT'S -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OH, YEAH! FOR MORE WE TURN TO OUR... OH. FOR MORE WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT JORDAN KLEPPER, WHO IS IN HOLLYWOOD. JORDAN, THANKS FOR -- [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
YEAH. THERE YOU GO, PEOPLE. DRINK IT ALL IN. YOU WIN, HACKERS, YOU WIN. YOU HAPPY? YES, TAKE IT! YES! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: JORDAN, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING OUT. SECOND OF ALL, WHY ARE YOU NAKED?
I'M TAKING BACK MY SEXUAL POWER. YOU KNOW, YOU WANT CELEBRITY NAUGHTY BITS. HERE THEY ARE, DING, DING, DING, DING, DINNERTIME, YOU SICK [BLEEPED].
Jon: WAIT. AND WHAT'S, WHAT'S ALL THE WRITING?
OH, IT'S ALL MY PERSONAL INFO. YEP, HERE'S MY BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, MY PINTEREST LOGIN, THIS IS MY PARENTS' HOME PHONE NUMBER IN CASE I GET LOST.
Jon: YOU'VE BASICALLY, YOU'VE COMPLETELY GIVING UP TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE EVERYTHING FROM HACKERS.
NO POINT IN TRYING, JON. THEY'LL FIND IT ANYWAY. IF I DON'T UPLOAD NUDE PHOTOS, THEY'LL BREAK INTO MY HOUSE AT NIGHT, YANK OFF THE COVERS AND SNAP A PICTURE OF ME AND MY SLUMBER CHUB.
Jon: YOUR SLUMBER CHUB?
DADDY'S GOT REST, JON.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. JORDAN, I MEAN THIS IN NO DISRESPECT HERE, BUT I DON'T THINK HACKERS, THE GENERAL PUBLIC, ET CETERA, ARE REALLY CLAMORING TO SEE YOU NAKED.
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, JON? WE ARE ALL BEING HUNTED, J-LAW, J-LO, J.-KLEP. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE OUR J-UNK. SO I'M GIVING THEM MINE. J-ON.
Jon: BUT, THAT'S THE THING, ACTUALLY. NO ONE ACTUALLY IS HUNTING FOR MEN'S JUNK. THE ONLY VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES ARE WOMEN. IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO HARASS WOMEN.
OK, BUT I SEE MEN'S DICK PICS ALL THE TIME. CONSTANTLY. ANTHONY WEINER, BRETT FAVRE, KANYE.
YEAH, BUT NOBODY WAS SEEKING THOSE OUT. THOSE GENTLEMENT SENT THOSE PICTURES GENERALLY UNSOLICITED TO AN UNWANTING PUBLIC.
OK, I THINK I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT HERE. SO IF SOMEONE WANTS TO ACTUALLY REDEEM IT, IT'S, WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OF A NUMBERS GAME.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, JORDAN. I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT IT'S NOT THAT -- HOLD ON. I'M GETTING A TEXT ON THE... [LAUGHTER] OH, JORDAN.
YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT WAS MY DICK PIC I JUST SENT YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT'S SIGNED RIGHT ON IT, "THIS IS JORDAN KLEPPER'S PENIS." AND BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
