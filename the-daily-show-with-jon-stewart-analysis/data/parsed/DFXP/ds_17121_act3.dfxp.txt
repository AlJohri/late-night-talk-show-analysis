( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  MY GUEST TONIGHT. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN.
ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS FUN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING! WHOOO!
Jon:  THAT WOULD MAKE AN AMAZING MUSICAL. ( LAUGHTER ). PLEASE WELCOME ANDREW GARFIELD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) HEY. YOU, SIR, YOU, SIR--
NO, YOU.
Jon:  CONGRATULATIONS.
ON WHAT?
Jon:  ON THIS WHOLE THING YOU'RE DOING, STAR-LIKE. TELL ME ABOUT THIS "SPIDER-MAN."
THIS "SPIDER-MAN" HAS BEEN AROUND 50 YEARS, JON.
Jon:  THAT'S DAUNTING, IS IT NOT?
TERRIFYING.
Jon:  EVERYONE KNOWS SPIDER-MAN, COMIC BOOK FANS ARE SOME OF THE MOST RABID FANS. DO YOU FEAR THEIR WRATH. DO YOU ENJOY THEIR ENTHUSIASM? WHAT'S BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE?
ALL OF THAT. I WENT TO COMIC-CON LAST YEAR AND I WAS TERRIFIED AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNEW I  WAS JUST ONE OF THEM SO I KIND OF APPEARED IN THE AUDIENCE AS A FAN IN, LIKE, A CRAPPY COST  SCOURGE TRIED TO MAKE THEM KNOW THAT I WAS-- THAT I WAS JUST AS KIND OF FANATICAL AND I'LL BE  THE ONE IN THE THEATER SHOUTING, "WHY DO THEY CALL THAT BRITISH SCUM BACK AS MY FAVORITE SUPER HERO?
Jon:  REALLY. YOU HAVE A BLOG DEDICATED TO HATING ANDREW GARFIELD?
I SHOULD. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
Jon:  I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THOUGH, THE SUITS THEY HAVE NOW-- I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE OLD SUPER HERO MOVIES AND  GEORGE REEVES AND THE TV SHOW AND THE COSTUME WAS, "LOOK, I AM IN MY UNDERWEAR."  THIS SUIT-- IT IS FROM THE MOVIE. THIS IS YOU OFF SET IN THE SUIT. YOU'RE GETTING LUNCH.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  BUT DID YOU-- WHAT IS-- TELL ME ABOUT THAT SUIT.
NO, IT'S SPANDEX, AND IT'S HARD TO URINATE. ( LAUGHTER ) AND WHEN YOU --
INTERESTING THAT YOU BRING THAT UP. DO WE HAVE THAT? THERE WE GO. ( LAUGHTER ).   ( CHEERS )  THAT-- THAT IS ACTUALLY A STILL  FROM-- I THINK SOMEBODY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKING THE PICTURE. ( LAUGHTER )
THIS IS-- THIS IS A PICTURE, JON, THAT I TOOK THROUGHOUT WITH THE STILL PHOTOGRAPHER. WE HAD LIKE, "A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SPIDER-MAN MAN."
Jon:  ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I WAS SO FRUSTRATED CERTAIN DAYS IN THAT SUIT I NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING STUPID. WE WENT AROUND THE SONY LOT. I THINK THAT'S ME TAKING A ( BLEEP ).
Jon:  I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE WHOLE BOOK. SO JUST YOU GO AROUND--
THERE WAS ONE DAY. WHO WANTS TO HEAR AN ACTOR COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING SPIDER-MAN? NO WONG RIGHT? BUT IT SUCKS. SPANDEX ISN'T FUN. SPANDEX IS NOT FUN.
Jon:  BUT IT IS SLIMMING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OH, MY GOD, REALLY.
Jon:  THOUGHT YOU LOOKED TERRIFIC IN THAT.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
Jon:  SUPERMAN MAY BE THE MAN OF STEEL, BUT IN THAT, YOU ARE BUNS OF STEEL. YOU, I THOUGHT IT WAS-- YOU SAID SPIDER-MAN WAS YOUR GUY GROWING UP?
HE WAS. I HATE TO ADMIT IT BECAUSE IT ADDS TO THEISH AND KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEANS AND HOW MUCH IT MEANS  TO A BUSH OF SKINNY KIDS LIKE ME IS THERE WHAT WAS IT ABOUT SPIDER-MAN? WHEN I WAS LITTLE SUPERMAN WAS-- BECAUSE SUPERMAN SEEMED LIKE-- EVERYBODY SAID TO HAVE THE  CONVERSATIONS, WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT BETWEEN SUPERMAN? AND WE WERE LIKE SUPERMAN. UNLESS YOU HAVE KRYPTONITE. SO SPIDER-MAN ALWAYS, ANOTHER NICE COSTUME, HAS SOME WEBS BUT SUPERMAN WOULD BEAT THE  ( BLEEP ) OUT OF THAT DUDE. DON'T YOU THINK?
YEAH, YOU MAKE A SOLID POINT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. LET'S HOPE THOSE TWO NEVER FEEL THE NEED TO FIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  OR WE JUST CAME UP WITH THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) SPIDER-MAN VERSUS SUPERMAN-- NO, I-- BECAUSE I USED TO LOVE THE ORIGIN MYTHS, ALL THOSE THINGS. DID YOU DISCOVER IT THROUGH COMIC BOOKS OR ARE YOU YOUNG ENOUGH THAT THE MOVIE WAS OUT  WHEN YOU WERE, LIKE A KID. I WAS THREE WHEN TOBY MA-- NO, THAT WOULD MAKE ME 12 NOW. NO, THE ANIMATED SERIES WAS MY FIRST.
Jon:  YOU WERE, LIKE, 10 WHEN THE MOVIE CAME OUT.
I WAS 19.
Jon:  WHEN IT CAME OUT? OH, LET ME JUST SAY THIS, ( BLEEP ) YOU. YOU YOUNG PERSON YOU. THAT'S NICE. WELL, THIS IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY INVOLVED IN IT, THAT REALLY DOES KIND OF REVERE THE CHARACTERS. I THINK YOU NEED THAT TO SOME EXTENT TO CARRY IT THROUGH.
GRAY. IT CREATES A HEALTHY PRESSURE, THAT KNOWLEDGE, WHAT IT MEANS.
Jon:  AND IT'S NICE TO-- SPIDER-MAN HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT-- HE WAS BITTEN BY A NEUROTIC  SPIRED AND IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU'RE CARRYING THAT TRADITION THROUGH. I'M REALLY, REALLY TRYING.
Jon:  BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU PEE IN THAT THING?
YOU HAVE TO ESCAPE IT. YOU HAVE TO ESCAPE THE THING.
Jon:  SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PENILE HOUDINI? ( LAUGHTER ) DO YOU-- DO YOU EVERY TIME YOU PEE, DO YOU GO  ♪ TA-DA ♪ ♪  THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN IT'S IN THE THEATERS JULY 3. ANDREW GARFIELD.
