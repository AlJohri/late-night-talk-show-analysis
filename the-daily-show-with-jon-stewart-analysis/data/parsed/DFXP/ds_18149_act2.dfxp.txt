Jon: WELCOME BACK.  [APPLAUSE]
Jon: THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT OF CHAOS AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A FUN STORY, A NICE STORY.
DRUG SMUGGLERS HAVE SET FIRE TO A SHIP CARRYING 50 MILLION POUNDS WORTH OF HASHISH. THE SMUGGLERS TRIED TO BURN THEIR CARGO OFF THE GOLDEN STAR SHIP AFTER BEING SPOTTED BY THE ITALIAN CUSTOM OFFICIALS. UP TO 30 TONS OF HASH BURNED ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, CREATING A FOG OF THICK SMOKE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THANK YOU, JESUS. HASH CLOUD OVER ITALY. PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHY LAST NIGHT ITALY ORDERED FIVE MILLION PIZZAS FROM ITSELF. I CAN'T BELIEVE I NOTICED HOW DELICIOUS THIS IS. I HAVE TO SAY I'M SURPRISED THAT THE TWO DUDES ON THE HASH BOAT DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER THOUGHT OUT EXIT STRATEGY THAN "UH MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LIGHT IT." CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR STEP TWO.
AS CUSTOMS OFFICIALS MOVED IN ON FRIDAY, THE BOAT'S CREW MEMBERS SET FIRE TO THEIR CARGO AND BEGAN JUMPING INTO THE SEA.
Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THOUSANDS OF SHARKS A SERIOUS CASE OF THE MUNCHIES. AND WE'RE GOING TO DIVE HEAD FIRST INTO THEIR LIVING ROOM, LIKE A COMPLIMENTARY DELIVERY OF CRAZY BREAD. FOR MORE, WE GO TO SENIOR SMOLDERING DRUG BOAT CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL. AL, TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SITUATION THERE. BY THE WAY, I NOTICE YOU'RE NOT WEARING A MASK.
THAT'S HILARIOUS, JON. WHY WOULD I BE WEARING A MASK, IT IS NOT HALLOWEEN YET. [BLEEP] CLASSIC STEWART BRO. KILLING ME.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT ARE YOU TALKING INTO A BISCOTTI?
OH, YEAH, I WONDERED WHY THIS MICROPHONE WAS SO DELICIOUS.
Jon: TELL ME ABOUT THE BOAT. I UNDERSTAND THE CREW WAS SYRIANS AND EGYPTIANS --
JON. JON.
Jon: AL, YES.
I FORGOT. OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WHAT IF A GIANT PICKED UP THE HASH BOAT AND SMOKED IT, HOW (bleep) CRAZY WOULD THAT BE. YOU SHOULD HAVE THE GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT MOCK THAT UP. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
Jon: WE DON'T HAVE A GRAPHIC FOR YOU IF A GIANT SMOKED THAT BOAT. >>THAT'S OKAY I SENT MY OWN. CHUCK, CHUCK. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE SMUGGLERS NOW? ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO JAIL? HAVE THEY BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT ALL?
JON, AREN'T WE ALL IN JAIL? IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALL JUST TRAPPED ON AN ORB, JUST SPINNING IN SPACE.
Jon: ACTUALLY, THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST WRAP THIS UP, AL.
HEY, JON, JON --
Jon: YEAH?
TWO THINGS. FIRST, HOW DO THEY MAKE VELVET? AND, SECOND, CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS IS? I'M ON A SWEET GIG IN ITALY, IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A FLAMING HASH BOAT? I MEAN, TIME TO START COMING UP WITH A NEW DREAM.
Jon: THIS IS YOUR LIFE-LONG DREAM?
YEAH. JON, I HAD A VERY SPECIFIC BUCKET LIST WITH THREE THINGS ON IT: ITALY, WEED, AND BOAT. THREE BIRDS, ONE STONER.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AL.
