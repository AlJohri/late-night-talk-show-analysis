( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTRESS WHO  IS CURRENTLY ON AMC'S "MAD MEN."  PLEASE WELCOME LINDA CARDELLINI! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S RIGHT. THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE  RESPONSE.
I LIKE THAT RESPONSE.
John: CONGRATULATIONS ON  "MAD MEN."  IT IS FANTASTIC. YOU ARE GREAT IN IT.
THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: THAT IS HOW DEMOCRACY  WORKS?
I LOVE IT.
John: THAT IS NOW AN  OFFICIAL FACT IN HISTORY. I WAS READING A BIT ABOUT YOU,  AND I STUMBLED ONTO THE FACT  WHEN YOU WERE 19 YOU WERE ON THE "PRICE IS RIGHT. OF.
I WAS, YES, I WAS.
John: AND YOU WON A  ( BLEEP ) FIREPLACE.
I DID.
John: THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
I STILL HAVE IT.
John: YOU STILL HAVE IT?
YES. I KEPT IT FOR YEARS IN THE BOX  IN MY GARAGE. BECAUSE IT WAS THE VERY FIRST  TIME I WAS EVER ON TELEVISION SO  ONCE I WAS REALLY AN ACTRESS I WAS GOING TO PUT A PLAQUE ON IT  THAT SAID, "MY FIRST TIME ON  TELEVISION" AND BE VERY PROUD OF  IT. I KEPT IT ALL THESE YEARS AND  NEVER GOT THE PLAQUE AND I JUST  PUT IT UP IN MY HOUSE AND IT LOOKS TERRIBLE.
John: DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOES NOT MATTER.
IT DOES NOT BURN WOOD.
John: A BOB BARKER ENDORSED  FIREPLACE. IT'S THE FIRST THING PEOPLE SEE,  "ASK ME ABOUT THAT FIREPLACE  BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO HAVE A STORY THAT BLOWS YOUR MIND,"  ESPECIALLY BECAUSE AARON PAUL  WHO PLAYS JESSE, HE ALSO WAS ON THE "PRICE IS RIGHT."
WHAT DID HE WIN?
John: HE WON A DESK. ( LAUGHTER )  IT'S ALMOST LIKE AMC IS USING  THE "PRICE IS RIGHT" FOR  CASTING.
ONCE I PUT MY SNACKS, OR BOB  BARKER, YOU HAVE TO HAVE RON  DRAPER.
John: IF YOU CAN HAVE  BARKER DRAIRP IS NO PROBLEM. GROWING UP IN ENGLAND AS I DID,  I REMEMBER THE "PRICE IS RIGHT"  WAS ONE OF MY FIRST INTRODUCTIONS TO AMERICANS. ( LAUGHTER )
OH!
John: AND I WAS THINKING,  WOW, THEY ARE EXCITABLE.
I RAN DOWN THAT AISLE AND I  PRACTICALLY MOLESTED A STRANGER  I JUST HUGGED HER SO MUCH I WAS JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
John: DID YOU GO WITH THE  HIGH-FIVE? THAT WAS THE CLASSIC.
THEY TELL YOU WHEN YOUR NAME  IS CALLED-- IF YOUR NAME IS  CALLED AND I NEVER THOUGHT MY NAME WOULD BE CALLED AND THEY  PRONOUNCED IT INCORRECTLY-- TO  RAISE YOUR HAND. YOU'RE DOING WHAT THEY ASK YOU  TO DO BUT YOU LOOK LIKE CRAZY  WEAVING YOUR HANDS, AND OF COURSE YOU'RE EXCITE.
John: YOU'VE BEEN IN SO  MANY AMAZING THINGS. "MAD MEN" IS THE LATEST. YOU'RE IN "GRAVITY FALLS."
I PLAY THE VOICE OF WENDY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: WHERE DID ALL THIS  START, SCHOOL, I GUESS? DID YOU DO PLAYS IN SCHOOL?
WELL, I WAS KIND OF THE KID  THAT MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS LIKE,  "SHUT UP. STOP SINGING OR DANCING OR DOING  SOMETHING STUPID IN THE FRONT  ROOM."  I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOOD AT IT, AND A TEACHER CAME TO MY  CLASS IN SIXTH GRADE, AND SHE  THOUGHT I COULD SING AND SHE PUT ME IN A CHRISTMAS PLAY AND THAT  WAS IT.
John: THAT'S AS YOU THE  WAY. I START MY FIRST AND ALMOST ONLY  APPEARANCE ON STAGE WAS IN-- I  WAS SIX YEARS OLD IN THE NATIVITY AND I PLAYED THIRD  SHEPARD. ( LAUGHTER )  AND I SAID, "LO, A STAR," AND I  LEFT. THAT WAS-- THAT WAS THE HEIGHT  OF MY EXPERIENCE AS AN ACTOR.
I THINK YOU'RE DOING OKAY. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ).
John: HOW IS "MAD MEN"? WERE YOU A FAN OF "MAD MEN"  BEFORE?
YES, YES, I WAS A VERY BIG  FAN.
John: HOW STRANGE TO WALK  ON TO THE SET FOR THE FIRST  TIME.
IT'S AMAZING. THE SETS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND THE  PROPS ARE-- I MEAN, EVERY GLASS  IS GORGEOUS AND I LOVE THAT TIME  PERIOD.
John: DO YOU FIND "MAD MEN"  FANS CAN OVER-SHOOT THEIR  COMPLIMENTS INTO BECOMING  CREEPY. ""MAD MEN" IS GREAT. IT WAS SUCH A FANTASTIC TIME IN  AMERICAN HISTORY AM UPON. A SIMPLER TIME WHERE WE ALL KNEW  WHERE WE STOOD AND YOU'RE GOOD  IN IT."  ( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S THE FUNNY THING TSORT  OF GLAMARRIZES A LOT OF-- EVEN  FOR WOMEN. MY CHARACTER HAS A LOT OF THINGS  THAT SHE GOES THROUGH AS A WOMAN  THAT NOWADAYS ARE MUCH FURTHER. I THINK THE SOCIAL MORES ARE  VERY DIFFERENT. AND IT WAS QUITE A TUMULTUOUS  TIME.
John: THERE WAS AN AMAZING  EPISODE WHERE YOU WERE STUCK IN  THE HOTEL ROOM AS PART OF A NEFARIOUS SEX GAME YOU WERE JUST  LEFT ON YOUR OWN IN THERE. AT ONE POINT BEING ALONE STOP  BEING SEXY AND START BEING  BORING, I WONDER?
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY-- I  WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT WITH  SOMEBODY, AND THEY WERE SAYING IF THAT WERE MY HUSBAND I'D BE  VERY ANGRY. AND I SAID WELL, IT'S NOT OUR  HUSBAND. I THINK MAYBE BECAUSE THEY'RE  WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THEIR  HUSBANDS OR WIVES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO ENJOY YOURSELF ON  YOUR PRIVATE TIME.
John: IT PROBABLY STOPS--  IT STOPS OFFICIALLY BECOMING  SEXY PROBABLY ABOUT THE TIME YOU ORDER UP "ROMEO AND JULIETTE" ON  DEMAND. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT IN  IT. I WISH I HAD A FIREPLACE TO GIVE  YOU.
I HAVE ONE TO GIVE YOU.
John: IT'S THE LEAST YOU  DESERVE. "MAD MEN" IS SUNDAY NIGHTS AT  10:00 ON A.M.C. LINDA CARDELLINI. ( CHEERS AND
