Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. YES, OH, WE'RE EXCITED TO WELCOME THIS GENTLEMAN BACK, OUR GUEST TONIGHT ROB CORDDRY IS JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT MAN, AND I DON'T MIND SAYING IT THIS, THAT MAN IS EASILY IN MY TOP TWO  FAVORITE CORDDRY'S WHO HAS EVER WORKED HERE. (LAUGHTER) HEY, YOU'RE A REGULAR WATCHER OF THIS PROGRAM. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED ONE, I RECENTLY HAD A BREAST REDUCTION. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY ARE REAL AND THEY ARE-- AND TWO, WE'VE GOT A  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COMING UP. AMERICA'S DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST TWO DECADE THERE ARE  TWO WAYS A POLITICAL PARTY CAN REACT TO THAT YOU CAN EITHER EXPAND YOUR APPEAL TO  A NEW FIELD OF VOTERS BY MAKING THEIR ISSUES YOUR ISSUES. WELL, OR --
CAN THEY PASS THE VOTER OHIO LAW, LOY LOY, PENNSYLVANIA.
GORGE GRA, QUIND END RNLD KANSAS, ARE ALLOWED TO REQUIRE PHOTO I.D..
IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS DEMOCRATIC VOTERS.
THESE LAWS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MINORITY, THE YOUNG, THE OLD, THE POOR.
Stephen: THE YOUNG, THE OLD, THE POOR MINORITIES. FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE DEMOCALYPSE. WHICH IS WHY IT IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2012. AS YOU KNOW-- AS YOU KNOW AND YOU WELL KNOW THIS, IN PERSON VOTER FRAUD IS AN  ENORMOUS ISSUE WITH MORE THAN EXACTLY 10 DOCUMENTED CASES OF IT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ALONE. JUST SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE MILLENNIUM. THAT'S .000000284% OF ALL VOTES! (LAUGHTER) SO YOU CAN SEE WHY PENNSYLVANIA WOULD WANT TO ENACT A VOTER I.D. LAW THAT  ONE CITY CLAIMS COULD-- OR AROUND 9% OF THE ENTIRE PENNSYLVANIA ELECTORATE. BUT THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY TO PREVENT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE HOW PEANUT PUT CERTIFICATE MADE WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF HYDRO COLORIC  ACID TO-- DRAGON BONES THAT MAY HAVE GOTTEN INTO IT DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. WILL YOU LOSE SOME PEOPLE WHO DIE BY EATING HYDRO COLORIC ACID, OF COURSE. BUT ISN'T IT WORTH KNOWING THAT YOUR PEANUT BUTTER IS DRAGON BONE FREE? NOW PENNSYLVANIA HAS VOTED DEMOCRAT-- DEMOCRATIC IN THE LAST FIVE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. LEANING TOWARD OS BAMA IN THIS ELECTION. NOT ONLY THIS VOTER I.D. LAW IS BLATANTLY DESIGNED TO SKEW THAT RESULT, RIGHT? THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER THAT DESIGNED IT.
VOTER I.D. WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO WIN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, DONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LORD KNOWS WE DIDN'T WANT ROMNEY RUNNING ON HIS PERSONALITY AND POLICY, AM I  RIGHT PEOPLE. AND I'M ASSUMING THAT THE JUDGE IN PENNSYLVANIA WHO HAS BEEN ASKED TO REVIEW IT  WILL SEE IT AS A PARTISAN ACT.
IT IS A STUNNING DECISION FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA COURT. THE STATE'S NEW TOUGH VOTER I.D. LAW WILL NOT BE STOPPED. THE JUDGE BELIEVES IT WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN A NONPARTISAN EVENHANDED MANNER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES, OF COURSE. THIS LAW CREATED FOR SPECIFICALLY PARTISAN PURPOSES WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN A NONPARTISAN EVENHANDED MANNER. MUCH IN THE WAY THAT ROBO SAARUS WHILE CREATED SOLELY AS AN AUTOMOBILE EATING  MACHINE, WILL MOST LIKELY VALET PARK AT YOUR PARTY WITH NO FORESEEABLE PROBLEMS. WHY WOULD IT-- MAYBE I'M BEING TOO HARD ON IT. AS LONG AS VOTERS ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THE LAW IN A NONPARTISAN WAY.
A CONTRACT? FOR THE JOB OF EDUCATING PENNSYLVANIAIANS ON THE NEW VOTING RESTRICTIONS WAS GIVEN TO A MAN WHO HAS  HELPED RAISE $30,000 FOR THE MITT ROMNEY FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN. HE'S ALSO THE FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
Jon: ROBO SAARUS HUNGRY! ROBOSAURUS SMASH! WELL, I GUESS THAT DOES EXPLAIN THE NEW VOTER I.D. AD I SAW.
WAS'S UP, PENNSYLVANIA, GUESS WHOSE'S COME TOGETHER MONTGOMERIE COUNTY AMPITHEATRE. IT'S THE MOTOR CITY MAD MERN TED NUDGE ENT. REASONS HEY, FELLOW REPUBLICANS, NOW THAT ALL THE DEMOCRATS ARE CHANGED THE CHANNELS HERE IS VOTING INFORMATION. WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY BRING PHOTO IDENTIFICATION. IT IS REQUIRED. AND DON'T TELL ANY BLACKS OR OLD PEOPLE. AD PAID FOR BY THOSE WHO WANT ROMNEY TO WIN.
Jon: I WONDER IF HE GOT THAT AT A SHELL TER. BUT AS RIDICULOUS AS THIS VOTER I.D. BUSINESS IT IS NOT LIKE PENNSYLVANIA IS  DOING SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE GIVING REPUBLICAN COUNTIES MORE TIME TO VOTE THEN DEMOCRATIC COUNTIES. THEY'RE NOT CRAZY.
THE LATEST TWIST ON THIS HAS REPUBLICANS IN OHIO RESTRICTING EARLY VOTING  HOURS ON DEMOCRATIC COUNTIES BUT EXTENDING EARLY VOTING HOURS IN THE REPUBLICAN ONES.
Jon: ARE YOU-- [BLEEP] KIDDING ME! ALL AMERICANS WHO WANT EQUAL ACCESS TO THE VOTE TAKE TWO-STEPS FORWARD, NOT SO  FAST PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING BOULEVARD SOUTH. NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER HOW IT WOULD EVEN BE POSSIBLE FOR OHIO TO DIVIDE UP VOTING  HOURS BY HOW DISTRICTS VOTE. FUNNY STORY. OHIO COUNTY ELECTION BOARD EACH HAVE TWO REPUBLICANS AN TWO DEMOCRATS AND THE GUY  WHO BREAKS THE TIE IN ESTABLISHING POWERS IS OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN HOUSTON. REPUBLICAN. GUESS WHO HE HAS BEEN SIDING WITH. IT'S AS FAIR AS WHEN YOUR DAD BREAKS THE TIE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOM OVER  WHETHER YOU GET TO STAY OUT ALL NIGHT DRINKING. EXCEPT INSTEAD OF STAYING OUT ALL NIGHT DRINKING, IT'S VOTING. MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING. PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW FEWER PEOPLE VOTING SOMEHOW ENHANCES THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
I DON'T THINK THAT THE BAR IS TOO HIGH THERE FOR ANYBODY WHO REALLY CARES  ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND WANTS TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD BY VOTING. WE TRY TO MAKE IT EASY BUT WE CAN'T, YOU KNOW, I SAY WE'RE NOT 7-11. WE CAN'T STAY OPEN 24/7 AND LET ANYBODY VOTE BY ANY RULE THAT THEY WANT TO.
Jon: SURELY WE CAN'T EXPECT OUR CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED VOTING RIGHTS TO  MEET THE SAME HIGH STANDARDS AS A COMBINATION GAS STATION CONVENIENCE STORE. (LAUGHTER) NEED I REMIND YOU OF THE STRICT DRESS CODE. NOT SURPRISINGLY, THIS SITUATION AND THE RULING PROVOKES A NATIONAL OUTCRY.
AFTER HEAVY CRITICISM, OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE HAS JUST ORDERED THAT ALL 88 COUNTIES IN THAT STATE HAVE  TO ABIDE BY THE SAME EARLY VOTING RULES.
AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT MEDDLING CONSTITUTION AND OF COURSE THOSE KIDS IN  THAT VAN. THEY REALLY WERE THE ONES IT THAT REALLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  >
TWO THINGS, TWO STATES, TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEANS OF SUPPRESSING DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT. HERE IS THE ONE THING I HAVE IN COMMON. THE MECHANISM OF THE VOTE ARE IN THE HANDS OF PARTISAN ELECTED OFFICIALS. PERHAPS'S IT'S TIME THE WHEELS OF SOCIETY TOOK OUR CUES FROM OTHER HIGHLY  EVOLVED DEMOCRACIES AND ELECTION OVERSIGHT LIKE THEY DO IN MEXICO, CANADA, INDIA  AND OF COURSE RWANDA. THAT'S RIGHT. A PLACE SO TERRIBLE DON CHEADLE MADE A MOVIE ABOUT A HOTEL THERE. NO, THAT'S THE OTHER-- YEAH. (APPLAUSE) WE GOT TO GET OUR [BLEEP] TOGETHER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
