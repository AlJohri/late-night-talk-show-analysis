WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE EQUAL JUSTICE INITIATIVE, HE'S A PROFESSOR AT NYU LAW SCHOOL, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "JUST MERCY: A STORY OF JUSTICE AND REDEMPTION." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, BRYAN STEVENSON. SIR! HELLO! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.   [APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
I'M WELL, THANK YOU.
Jon:  THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US.   THE BOOK IS CALLED JUST MERCY.   TELL ME ABOUT THE WORK YOU DO,  THE FOUNDATION OF THIS BOOK.   TELL ME ABOUT THE VARIETY OF  THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON.
WELL, THE BOOK IS ABOUT MASS  INCARCERATION IN AMERICA AND THE WAY WE'VE DISCONNECTED FROM SO MANY OF THE REALITIES. IT TELLS THE STORY OF A MAN WHO WAS WRONGLY CONVICTED AND PUT ON DEATH ROW. AND YOU THINK THE SYSTEM WORKS ONE WAY BUT ACTUALLY WORKS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY. AND I MET THIS MAN WHO WHEN I WENT TO THE PRISON, TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN PUT ON DEATH ROW FOR 15 MONTHS BEFORE THE TRIAL, AND I THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND THEN I GOT BACK TO MY OFFICE AND A JUDGE NAMED ROBERT E. LEE CALLED AND TOLD ME NOT TO TAKE THE CASE. AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND THEN I WENT INTO THIS COMMUNITY WHERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS WERE TELLING ME THAT THEY WERE THIS MAN 11 MILES AWAY FROM THE CRIME SCENE WHEN THE CRIME TOOK PLACE AND HE WAS STILL CONVICTED AND STILL SENTENCED TO DEATH. THE JURY RETURED 25 TO LIFE. THE JUDGE OVERRODE IT, IMPOSED  THE DEATH PENALTY.   SO THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT, AND I THINK THE BOOK IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO KIND OF EXPOSE PEOPLE TO THAT DISCONNECT.   WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT TALKS  ABOUT BEING THE HOME OF THE  BRAVE AND THE LAND OF THE FREE  AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST  INCARCERATION RATE IN THE WORLD.
Jon: AND EVEN IN, YOU KNOW, JUST TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY, A GENTLEMAN CONVICTED OF MURDER AT 16 YEARS OLD, WRONGLY CONVICTED, IT IS 30 YEARS LATER, HE'S JUST GETTING OUT TODAY. HIS FRIEND WHO WAS CONVICTED WITH HIM, DIED IN PRISON.
YEAH.
Jon: THERE'S A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY NOW APPARENTLY BEING CHARGED AS AN ADULT FOR A MURDER.
YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: HOW ARE WE AS A COLLECTION ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN?
WELL, I THINK WE DON'T  APPRECIATE THE OBLIGATION TO BE  JUST IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.   THERE IS THIS DISCONNECT.   AND THERE IS THIS NARRATIVE OUT THERE CORRUPTED BY THE POLITICS OF FEAR AND ANGER. I MEAN, WE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST 40 YEARS. IN 1972, THERE WERE 300,000 PEOPLE IN JAILS AND PRISONS. TODAY THERE ARE 2.3 MILLION. AND THAT DISCONNECT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
CHILDREN, YOU KNOW, WE PROTECT CHILD STATUS IN AMERICA, AND WE'RE BEING DISHONEST  WHEN WE SAY KIDS CAN'T VOTE, CAN'T DRINK, CAN'T SMOKE BUT IF  THEY COMMIT A CRIME, WE CAN  IGNORE THEIR CHILD STATUS. AND THAT'S WHO WE ENDED UP WITH 13  AND 14-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN  SENTENCED TO DIE IN PRISON.
Jon: AND IT'S ALMOST NOT EVEN A DISCONNECT BUT IT'S PURPOSEFUL. I CAN REMEMBER THE POLITICS OF FEAR THROUGHOUT THE '70s AND EARLY '80s.
YEAH, YEAH. SURE.
Jon: THAT WE WERE UNDER ATTACK BY, I REMEMBER THEY USED TO CALL THEM THE SUPER  PREDATORS.
SUPER PREDATORS.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
THAT'S RIGHT .
Jon:  AND WE HAD TO PROTECT  OURSELVES FROM SUPER PREDATORS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: AND THEN THE THREE STRIKES RULE  CAME IN.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE INSTITUTED.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S A NARRATIVE THAT WAS INTRODUCED. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, THESE CRIMINOLOGISTS STARTED TALKING ABOUT SUPER PREDATORS, AND THEY WERE TALKING MOSTLY ABOUT YOUNG BLACK AND BROWN BOYS AND THEY MADE THESE PREDICTIONS, AND WE STARTED ELIMINATING THE MINIMUM AGE FOR TRYING A CHILD AS AN ADULT, THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE 10-YEAR-OLDS FACING ADULT IMPRISONMENT.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE MADE IT EASIER TO PUT THESE KIDS IN PRISON FOREVER, AND THEN WE STARTED PASSING MANDATORY SENTENCES LAWS, AND THAT MEANT THAT WE'VE GOT PEOPLE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES FOR WRITING A BAD CHECK OR DRUG USE, SIMPLE POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND IT'S CRAZY.  BUT I THINK WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN  OUTRAGED ENOUGH.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF  INCARCERATION IN THE WORLD AND  WE'RE NOT ASHAMED OF THAT.
Jon:  NOT ONLY NOT OUTRAGED.  I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A  DEFENSIVENESS IN THE COMMUNITY.  I HAD A GENTLEMAN ON LAST NIGHT  THAT I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD BE  FAMILIAR WITH, WHO IS VERY  ADAMANT THAT RACE WAS NOT AN  ISSUE IN THESE.   AND YET DISPROPORTIONATELY, AND STATISTICALLY IT IS.   AND WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THAT  CONVERSATION AND I WASN'T TRYING TO BLAME HIM.   JUST MERELY AND NOT VERY  ARTICULATELY, POINT OUT IT WAS  REAL.
SURE.
Jon: WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET PAST THAT DEFENSIVENESS AND ANGER?
WELL, WE'VE NEVER EVER  COMMITTED OURSELVES TO A PROCESS OF TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION OF  OUR HISTORY.   WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE  CONSEQUENCES OF A MYTH THAT  CREATED SLAVERY AND BECAUSE OF  THAT SLAVERY DIDN'T END, IT  EVOLVED.   WE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WHAT IT  MEANT TO TERRORIZE PEOPLE  BETWEEN THE END OF  RECONSTRUCTION AND WORLD WAR II. AND THEN WE HAD JIM CROW AND  SEGREGATION AND WE DOMINATED AND HUMILIATED PEOPLE FOR DECADES  WITHOUT APPRECIATING THE HARM  DONE BY THAT. AND NOW WE'RE IN AN ERA WHERE OUR FAILURE TO TALK HONESTLY ABOUT RACE AND THE LEGACY OF RACIAL INEQUALITY CONTINUES TO HAUNT  US. THERE ARE THESE PRESUMPTIONS OF DANGEROUSNESS AND GUILT THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO  PEOPLE OF  COLOR, THAT'S HOW MR. MCMILLAN GOT  CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO  DEATH.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WE'RE SO KIND OF TRAPPED BY SILENCE, THAT IT'S HARD FOR US, BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THAT. YOU KNOW, IN GERMANY, THERE WAS THE HOLOCAUST, A HORRIFIC, HORRIFIC HISTORY. BUT IF YOU GO THERE, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO CONFRONT THAT LEGACY.
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE ARE MONUMENTS AND  MEMORIALS AND THERE ARE TOTEMS  THAT MAKE YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH  THAT.   IN THIS COUNTRY WE TRY TO HIDE  THAT HISTORY.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
AND IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN TRAGIC WAYS.
Jon: AND THERE'S THIS SENSE OF WELL, BUT WE DON'T HAVE SLAVERY ANYMORE, AND WE DON'T HAVE SEGREGATION, SO GET OVER IT. THE GENTLEMAN I REFERRED TO FROM LAST NIGHT SPOKE OF THE CODIFIED SEGREGATION OF THE 50s AND 60s AS THOUGH IT WERE THE MIDDLE AGES -- BUT THAT WAS THE 50s AND '60s.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I STARTED MY EDUCATION IN A COLORED SCHOOL BECAUSE SCHOOLS WERE STILL RACIALLY SEGREGATED. THE COUNTY WHERE MY FATHER GREW UP DIDN'T HAVE A BLACK HIGH SCHOOL. HE HAD TO LEAVE. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS THE DAUGHTER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ENSLAVED.   AND ALL OF THESE REALITIES HAVE LASTING CONSEQUENCES. A BLACK MALE BABY BORN IN THE 21 CENTURY, ONE IN THREE BLACK MALE BABIES BORN IN THE 21ST CENTURY IS EXPECTED TO GO THE JAIL OR PRISON. THAT WASN'T TRUE IN THE 20th CENTURY. THAT WASN'T TRUE IN THE 19th CENTURY. NOW WE'VE CREATED THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE TO CONFRONT MORE HONESTLY. AND THAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE, TO TALK MORE HONESTLY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
Jon: WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW, SO IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND, WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE BECAUSE I ALMOST THINK WE NEED INSTRUCTIONS.
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN TAKING PLACE EXCEPT AMONGST WHITE PEOPLE YELLING AT EACH  OTHER.   "JUST MERCY" WILL BE ON THE BOOK  SHELVES ON TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY.   BRYAN STEVENSON, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH.
