[ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU MAY RECALL LAST MONTH WHEN PRO-RUSSIAN MILITIAS TOOK OVER THE CRIMEAN PENINSULA AND HANDED IT TO RUSSIA. NOW MANY THOUGHT THE MILITIAS WERE NOT ONLY PRO-RUSSIAN BUT RUSSIAN. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN KNEW DIFFERENT.
THOSE ARE LOCAL SELF DEFENSE UNITS.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE MAN AT HIS WORD. COME ON. LOOK AT THAT FACE. WOULD THAT FACE LIE TO YOU?  DON'T ANSWER THAT BECAUSE THAT FACE WOULD KILL YOU WITH POISON. ACTUALLY, THAT FACE DID LIE TO YOU. VLADIMIR PUTIN IN THE MEANTIME SPOKE ON RUSSIAN TV FOR THE FIRST TIME HE ADMITTED THE TROOPS IN UNMARKED UNIFORMS WHO TOOK CRIMEA BEFORE ITS ANNEXATION BY MOSCOW WERE, IN FACT, RUSSIAN SOLDIERS.
Jon: APRIL FOOLS'. IN FEBRUARY. NOW ORDINARILY, I WOULD JUST LET BY GONES BE BY GONES, BUT HERE'S THE THING, AS OF LAST WEEK HUGE PARTS OF EASTERN UKRAINE ARE NOW FILLED WITH THE SAME MYSTERY MILITIAS. THEY'RE TAKING OVER GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, AND THEY'RE OCCUPYING THE STREETS, AND NOT ONLY TAKING UKRAINIAN ARMY TANKS, THEY ARE DOING (bleep) WITH THEM I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD DO. I MEAN, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, MAN, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO UKRAINE THAT IS AWESOME. BUT AT LEAST NOW THAT PUTIN IS MORE ACCUSTOMED TO TELLING THE TRUTH I AM SURE HE WILL LEVEL AS TO RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT.
THIS IS NONSENSE. THERE ARE NO RUSSIAN UNITS IN THE EAST OF THE UKRAINE.
Jon: WELL, HIS LIPS SAY NO, BUT THE OTHER GUY THAT WAS TALKING SAYS -- LOOK, HE LIES ALL THE TIME, SO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP? IF WE HAD SOME KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHIC PROOF THAT THE MILITIAS IN THE UKRAINE ARE ACTUALLY RUSSIAN SOLDIERS.
NEW PHOTOS PROVIDED TO A EUROPEAN MONITORING BODY AND PUBLISHED BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" JUST TODAY GIVE SOME INSIGHT INTO WHO HAS BEEN SEIZING GOVERNMENT SITES IN EASTERN UKRAINE. THE TIMES SAYS THESE PHOTOS LINK THE GUNMEN KNOWN AS GREEN MEN TO RUSSIA.
Jon: REALLY?  THAT IS YOUR EVIDENCE?  CHUNKY GUY WITH A BEARD?  IT LOOKS LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY IN EASTERN EUROPE. THAT IS EVERY OTHER GUY ON THE PLANET. LIKE TWO-THIRDS OF ZZ TOP. I MEAN, COME ON. I THINK THAT IS LIKE THE GUY THAT PRODUCED THE BEASTIE BOYS FIRST ALBUM. LOOK, I AM STARTING TO THINK RUSSIA HASN'T INVADED UKRAINE AT ALL AND THIS ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL CRISIS IS JUST AN ELABORATE MOCKUMENTARY PRANK BY JOAQUIN PHOENIX.
I AM GOING TO NEED MORE EVIDENCE THESE MILITIA MEN ARE NOT JUST LOCALS.
YOU WOULD TALK TO LOCALS IN THESE TOWNS AND THEY WOULD SAY PEOPLE AT THE BARRICADES SPEAK WITH RUSSIAN ACCENTS AND DON'T KNOW THEIR WAY AROUND.
Jon: I GUESS THEY WEREN'T DOING DOUGHNUTS IN THE TANKS, THEY WERE JUST SO LOST THEY WERE DRIVING IN CIRCLES.
THEY SAID THERE WAS WAFFLE HOUSE AROUND HERE. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM GOING. I AM JUST -- I AM JUST HUNGRY.
Jon: SO, NOW THAT WE KNOW THESE ARE RUSSIANS, THE QUESTION IS, HOW SHOULD AMERICA DEAL WITH IT AND PLEASE FRAME YOUR ANSWER WITH THE STUPIDEST OPTION WE CAN TAKE.
WE NEED TO DO SOME THINGS TACTICALLY. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM LETHAL WEAPONS, GIVE THEM 100 T-72 TANKS FROM NATO STOCKS.
Jon: WE DID THAT ALREADY AND THE RUSSIANS TOOK THEM AND STARTED DOING DOUGHNUTS!  IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE RUSSIAN 7-11! ISN'T THERE ANYONE IN RUSSIA WHO CAN PIN PUTIN NOW.
U.S. FORMER U.S. SPY CONTRACTOR EDWARD SNOWDEN HAVING HIS FIRST KNOWN PUBLIC CONVERSATION WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
Jon: OH (BLEEP). IT IS THE SNOW MAN! OH, YEAH! FALCON AND THE SNOW MAN UP IN THIS (bleep)! IF ANYBODY CAN HOLD PUTIN'S FEET TO THE FIRE IT IS THIS CAT.
DOES RUSSIA INTERCEPT STORE OR ANALYZE IN ANY WAY THE COMMUNICATIONS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS?
Jon: OH!  HOW IS OLD VLADDY GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ONE?
WE DON'T HAVE A MASS SYSTEM OF SUCH INTERCEPTION. AND ACCORDING TO OUR LAW, IT CANNOT EXIST.
Jon: TOUCHE. WHO WOULD EVER HAVE THOUGHT PUTIN COULD OUTWIT A PRERECORDED QUESTION FROM A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS IN HIS HANDS?  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
