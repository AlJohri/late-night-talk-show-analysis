FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE ARE VERY EXCITED. WHAT TIME IS IT?  OUR GUEST TONIGHT, BILL O'REILLY IN A SEGMENT SPONSORED BY THE WORD WHY?  WHY?  THE QUESTION MY AUDIENCE ASKS EVERY TIME I HAVE BILL O'REILLY ON. ALSO BROUGHT TO YOU BY HOW?  HOW, THEY SAY?  HOW DO YOU SIT ACROSS FROM THAT GUY?  FUNDING ALSO PROVIDED BY IT IS JUST -- IT IS JUST I FIND HIS VIEWS SO REPELLENT AND YOU ARE ALMOST ENDORSING HIM BY GIVING HIM A PLATFORM AND DO YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GUY?  I MEAN, COME ON!  AND ALSO BY ARBY'S.
ARBY'S. ISN'T THERE ANYWHERE ELSE WE CAN EAT?  WHAT IS THAT OVER THERE?  THAT'S A GAS STATION. ALL RIGHT. FINE. ARBY'S. BUT OBVIOUSLY, AND THEY WONDER IF WE ARE WRITING UP TO THE TIME OF THE SHOW. OH, WE ARE WRITING, BABY!  WE ARE DOING IT, BABY! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: IT IS LIKE AN INSURRECTION IN HERE, IN 2003 -- I HAVE A TRANSCRIPT OF THE O'REILLY SHOW. O'THERE IS OBVIOUSLY ONLY ONE STORY FOR US TO COVER TONIGHT, THE IMPENDING SHUTDOWN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S SPECIAL PRESENTATION. â™ª
FOR THOSE JUST JOINING THE STORY IN PROGRESS OUR GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO SHUT DOWN IN 57 OF YOUR EARTH MINUTES. BECAUSE THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE REFUSING TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT, UNLESS THE REST OF CONGRESS DELAYS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ALSO KNOWN AS OBAMACARE. ALSO KNOWN AS THE END OF AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT FOR REASONS NO ONE IS ABLE TO CLEARLY EXPLAIN. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?  LET'S LET THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS TRY.
THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON LIMITED GOVERNMENT, PERSONALON RESPONSIBILITY AND CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED, BUT OBAMACARE IS BASED ON LIMITLESS GOVERNMENT.
WE ARE LEADING ON PROTECTING HARDWORKING AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT ARE FEELING THE OVERREACH FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
I COME TO THE FLOOR AS MANY OF US DO TO SPEAK ABOUT, ABOUT THE INTRUSION INTO A GOD-GIVEN AMERICAN FREEDOM CALLED OBAMACARE.
IT IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING OF GOD GIVEN AMERICAN LIBERTY.
Jon: THEY ARE JUST THROWING WORDS TOGETHER. UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKINGS OF GOD GIVEN AMERICANS -- IT SOUNDS LIKE A (BLEEP) OF RANDOM PATRIOTIC BUZZ WORDEES.
IF IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THE CONSTITUTION, NO ONE LOVES THE CONSTITUTION LIKE YOU GUYS.
THE CONSTITUTION IS THE FOUNDATION.
A GREAT DOCUMENT, THE CONSTITUTION.
THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND. THE GREATEST GOVERNING DOCUMENT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
I CARRY A COPY.
JUST LOOK AT YOUR CONSTITUTION. WHICH I KEEP IN MY POCKET. SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE MY POCKET. BUT I GUARANTEE YOU IT IS IN HERE.
Jon: HOLD ON, HOLD ON. I HAVE GOT -- WAIT, THAT IS MY WEED. I GOT MY WEED. I GOT A COUPLE OF RUBBERS HERE. AH. SON OF A BITCH THAT'S THE MONITOR LIZARD I USE TO GUARD MY COPY OF THE CONSTITUTION. I THINK I GOT SOME BAND-AIDS IN THERE, SON OF A BITCH, HE BIT ME AGAIN!  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?  PERHAPS WE CAN LOOK TO THE CONSTITUTION FOR A SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS. LET ME GET MINE. SON OF A BITCH!
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. SO IN 2009 CONGRESS PASSED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WERE THEY ALLOWED TO DO THAT?
CONGRESS MAY DETERMINE THE TIME OF -- ISN'T THERE A CARTOON THAT EXPLAINS THIS?
YES, I'M ONLY A BILL, AND IF THEY VOTE FOR ME ON CAPITOL HILL, WELL, THEN, I AM OFF TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE I WAIT IN A LINE WITH A LOT OF OTHER BILLS FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SIGN. AND IF HE SIGNS ME THEN I WILL BE A LAW!
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST REALIZED, ONE OF THOSE BILLS I THINK HAD A HARPOON IN ITS CHEST. LOOK AT THAT. ONE OF THOSE BILLS IS LIKE I NEED A DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT, SO APPARENTLY THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT, THEY ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE LAWS AND THE PRESIDENT IS ALLOWED TO SIGN LAWS AND WHAT DO WE DO IF THOSE LAWS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL?  WELL, APPARENTLY NINE PRECOGS IN MAGIC ROBES GOT TOGETHER LOOKED AT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND DECIDED IT WAS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO EVERYTHING APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DONE LITERALLY BY THE BOOK. THIS BILL IS A LAW INVENTED BY THE SYSTEM THE REPUBLICANS SAY THETHEY LOVE, BUT TO HEAR THEY REPUBLICANS TELL IT, THE WHOLE THING COULD BE AVOIDED IF OBAMA WOULD MEET THEM HALFWAY.
THEY HAVE REFUSED TO EVEN CONSIDER THE COMPROMISE WE HAVE OFFERED.
THEY WON'T NEGOTIATE WITH US ON ANYTHING.
WHAT HAVE THE DEMOCRATS COMPROMISED ON, NOTHING.
HARRY REID WON'T MEET WITH JON BOEHNER, THE PRESIDENT WON'T MEET WITH JON BOEHNER.
THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TO COMPROMISE ON ANYTHING.
THERE IS NO RESOLUTION UNLESS YOU SIT TOGETHER AND BRIDGE THE DIVIDE.
Jon: THE BRIDGE, THERE IS NO DIVIDE TO THE LAW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: HOW -- NOBODY IS SAYING IT'S A GOOD LAW, NOBODY'S SAYING IT'S A BAD LAW, IT'S A LAW. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE WORLD WORKS? DID YOU SEE THE GIANTS GAME ON SUNDAY?  THEY LOST 31 TO SEVEN. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE GIANTS DIDN'T SAY AFTER THAT GAME?  IF YOU DON'T GIVE US 25 MORE POINTS BY MIDNIGHT ON MONDAY, WE WILL SHUT DOWN THE (BLEEP) NFL. THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS ASPIRED TO THE MATURITY AND PROBLEM SOLVING CAPACITY OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. MAN! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: THIS IS UTTER INSANITY. THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO GET FRIED FOR THIS ON THE NEWS. F
IN THE TUG OF WAR OVER THE BUDGET AND OBAMACARE WILL PRESIDENT OR REPUBLICANS BLINK FIRST?  NEITHER SIDE LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO CAVING.
HEADING TOWARD A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, WHO WILL BLINK FIRST?
THERE IS A LOT OF BLAME TO GO AROUND IN WASHINGTON.
NEITHER SIDE IS READY TO GIVE AN INCH.
WE HAVE A POLITICAL GAME OF CHICKEN WITH A WHOLE LOT RIDING ON IT.
Jon: NO WE DON'T!  I AM ALL FOR A POX ON BOTH OF THEIR HOUSES WHEN APPROPRIATE BUT THIS IS NOT A GAME OF CHICKEN, THIS IS WHEN SOMEONE IS DRIVING TO WORK AND THERE IS CAR COMING DIRECTLY AT THEM IN THEIR LANE, THAT IS NOT A GAME OF CHICKEN, THAT IS A (BLEEP) CAUSING AHEAD ON COLLISION. LET ME SEE IF I CAN PUT THIS IN ANOTHER WAY FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS.
YOU GET NOTHING!  YOU LOSE!  GOOD DAY, SIR! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICANS WILL HEED THIS ADVICE. BECAUSE HE IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. PERHAPS NOTHING SUMS UP THE  SHEER RIDICULOUSNESS OF THIS SITUATION, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE REPUBLICANS HAVE LEFT THE PLANE OF REASON MORE THAN THIS NEW TALKING POINT THAT THEY THEMSELVES ROLLED OUT THIS WEEKEND.
THE PRESIDENT WILL NEGOTIATE WITH THE IRANIANS, BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE WILL NOT TALK TO THE HOUSE.
Jon:.
HAVE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY WITH THE REPUBLICANS AS YOU DO WITH THE RUSSIANS AND IRANIANS.
THE PRESIDENT IS MORE THAN WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH IRANIANS, I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH US.
Jon: BRRRR, BRRR, BRRR.
YOU ARE NOT HELPING YOURSELF. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CAN MAKE A DEAL WITH THE MOST INTRANSIGENT HARD-LINE UNREASONABLE TOTALITARIAN MULLAHS IN THE WORLD, BUT NOT WITH REPUBLICANS?  MAYBE HE IS NOT THE PROBLEM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
