JANUARY 27, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS  "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: EVERYBODY WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TONIGHT'S GUEST, T. BOONE PICKENS. HE WILL GET US OFF OF OIL. TONIGHT! FOREIGN OIL! TONIGHT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE  THE REVOLUTION IN TUNISIA HAS SO CAPTIVATED THE WORLD'S ATTENTION  IT EVEN MADE IT INTO TUESDAY'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA STANDS WITH THE PEOPLE OF TUNISIA AND SUPPORTS THE  DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS OF ALL PEOPLE. (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) OH, MY GOD, MOTHER OF TWO AND INSPIRATIONAL CITIZEN KATHY  PROCTER, STOP TAKING CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING! (LAUGHTER) YOUR STORY IS GOOD ENOUGH. WELL, NOW THAT THIRST FOR DEMOCRACY HAS APPARENTLY SPREAD FROM TUNISIA TO EGYPT WHERE  PROTESTORS HAVE ALSO TAKEN TO THE STREETS EN MASSE.
THE FIRST DEMAND YOU CAN HEAR IN THE CHANT "DOWN, DOWN, HOSNI MUBARAK."  MUBARAK HAS BEEN THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS.
Jon: WHAT? THEY... THEY DON'T LIKE MUBARAK? WHY DO THEY KEEP ELECTING HIM IN LANDSLIDES? (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. IN 2005, HE WAS ELECTED WITH 88% OF THE VOTE! I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN GET ELECTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH 90% OF THE VOTE AND  THAT IS TO BE A BELOVED LEADER. (LAUGHTER) OH, REALLY,? THERE'S ANOTHER... WHAT KIND OF FIST? OH. IRON. (LAUGHTER) SO CLEARLY THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. (LAUGHTER) REALLY, YOU LIKE THAT? A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH TERM LIMITS. WHAT RELATION THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE ANGRY ABOUT?
IN THE MARKET, THE PRICE OF BASICS HAS GONE UP BY AROUND 20% IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PRICE OF CATS WENT UP 20%? (LAUGHTER) A NINE-POUND CAT USED TO BE, LIKE, A BUCK AND A HALF. NOW IT'S PROBABLY LIKE $1.80. I GUESS IF YOU LIVE IN EGYPT AND YOU DIDN'T RECENTLY INVEST HEAVILY IN CATS YOU'RE (BEEP)  OUT OF LUCK. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE ALL SAW HOW MUCH LOVE THE TUNISIAEN PEOPLE GOT FOR THEIR YUP RISING.
AS WE MONITOR THE SITUATION CAREFULLY WE ALL ON ALL PARTIES TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT AND  REFRAIN FROM VIOLENCE.
ALL I CAN THEY MORNING IS EGYPT HAS BEEN AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ALLY SINCE ANWAR SADAT  AND WE'RE ALL WATCHING THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN CAIRO VERY CAREFULLY. BEYOND THAT, I THINK I WILL NOT COMMENT.
Jon: FREEDOM! (COUGHS) I'M SO VERY I. NO COMMENT! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) WHAT GIVES?
THE PROBLEM FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT'S GOING GO. WE NEED ALLIES IN THE REGION. WE HAVE A LOT THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY. WE WANT TO BE FOR THE ASPIRATIONS OF PEOPLE. WE WANT TO BE FOR REFORM BUT STABILITY MATTERS TO PROSPER ANY THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
Jon: AH, THE OLD FREEDOM ASPIRATION OF PEOPLE STABILITY BOUND. WE WANT EGYPTIAN PEOPLE TO HAVE FREEDOM JUST AS SOON AS WE'RE  SURE THEY'LL USE THAT FREEDOM FOR HUGGING, NOT HURTING. SEE, TUNISIA'S REP STATION AS A MORE SECULAR MODERATE NATION  WHEREAS EGYPT, IT'S THE TOP ONE OF THE REGION'S LARGEST RESERVES  OF UNTAPPED ISLAMIST RAGE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OUTCOME OF THE REVOLUTION IS WHO GETS THE CREDIT.
IRONICALLY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND SECRETARY OF STATE CONDOLEEZZA  RICE'S FAMOUS SPEECH IN 2005 AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO  THAT LAUNCHED THIS REVOLUTION.
I WOULD POINT YOU TO THE SPEECH IN CAIRO IN 2009 WHERE THE PRESIDENT ALSO SPECIFICALLY  ADDRESSED THIS.
THIS PROTEST HAS BEEN ORGANIZED LARGELY ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: QUICK QUESTION, JON STEWART, "THE DAILY SHOW". SO IF TWO SPEECHES AND A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE IS ALL WE NEEDED TO SPREAD DEMOCRACY, WHY DID WE  INVADE IRAQ? WHY DIDN'T WE JUST, I DON'T KNOW POKE THEM? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO WHO DESERVES THE CREDIT. WHO DESERVES THE CREDIT FOR THIS UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC UPRISING SWEEPING THE MUSLIM WORLD? TO DISCUSS WE'RE JOINED BY OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS. JASON JONES, WE'LL START WITH YOU.
JOHN, THIS IS ALL THANKS TO PRESIDENT BUSH. A DEMOCRACY IS SPREADING BECAUSE THEY KNOW IF IT DOESN'T AMERICA'S GOING TO GO IN THERE  AND SPREAD IT FOR THEM! THAT'S RIGHT, U.S.A.! U.S.A.! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NOW LET'S GO AND KNOCK DOWN SOME (BEEP) STATUES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S A GREAT TRADITION OF AMERICAN BINGE DRINKING. OLIVIA?
JON, FREEDOM IS SPREADING THROUGH THE MUSLIM WORLD BECAUSE OF OBAMA AND HIS 2009 SPEECH IN CAIRO. HE INSPIRED AND IMPRESSED PEOPLE TO EMBRACE DEMOCRACY AND, 19 MONTHS LATER, HERE WE ARE.
Jon: FROM ONE SPEECH.
UM, FROM ONE OBAMA SPEECH! YOU KNOW, THEY SAY WHENEVER HE USES ALLITERATION AN ANGEL HAS AN ORGASM. (LAUGHTER)
UM, EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. JON STEWART?
SAMANTHA BEE? YES, SAM.
JACKET JASON AND @ JASON. THIS IS ALL THANKS TO TWITTER, HASHTAG TWITTER REVOLUTION.
Jon: SAM, IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING-- AND I'M NOT  SURE THAT I DO-- YOU'RE SAYING SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYED THE BIGGEST  ROLE IN SPARKING THESE UPRISING.
D',H @ JON STEWART. SOMETHING YOU'D KNOW IF YOUR OVERSIZED BUTTON OLD PERSON PHONE GOT TWITTER. HASHTAG BURN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHY DO YOU...
EXCUSE ME, JON.
Jon: AASIF MANDVI LIVE FROM CAIRO. AASIF, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE SITUATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
JON, I WOULD ARGUE EACH OF THESE NATIONS IS REACTING TO SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES UNIQUE TO  THEIR COUNTRY. IN TUNISIA, THE HIGH PRICE OF FOOD, IN EGYPT, PENT UP FRUSTRATION OVER 0 YEARS OF CORRUPT RULE. IN YEMEN...
NO! BUSH DOCTRINE. (LAUGHTER)
AASIF, OBAMA TAUGHT YOUR PEOPLE HOW TO LOVE! (LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT EGYPTIAN. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU'RE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
DON'T MAKE US INVADE YOU.
Jon: THAT'S IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
