(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FAREED ZAKARIA MAKING HIS 400th APPEARANCE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) FIRST, OBVIOUSLY, EVERYBODY IS STILL STUNNED AFTER THE TERRIBLE  SHOOTINGS FRIDAY. ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON HOW TO PREVENT THESE TYPES OF TRAGEDIES? I... IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE, OBVIOUSLY. AN INTERSECTION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM, CULTURAL INFLUENCES, THE BALANCE BETWEEN  INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE VIABILITY OF GUNS.
I THINK NOW REALLY IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE A BIG NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE... IT'S A FACTOR. I MEAN... I MEAN, IT'S A FACTOR ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM. OWNING A GUN IS A RIGHT PROTECTED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT'S... YOU KNOW, I AGREE  WITH THAT. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH THAT, IT'S RIGHT THERE. BUT WE CAN'T HAVE TANKS. (LAUGHTER) SO WE... IF WE DRAW LINES ON WEAPONRY, OBVIOUSLY, THE QUESTION IS HAVE WE DRAWN THEM RIGHT?
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S, FRANKLY  I THINK, INSULTING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO POLITICIZE SOMETHING AS  HORRIFIC AS THIS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION TO INSULT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC... WHICH I  BELIEVE IS ONE OF THE TOP PUBLICS IN THIS COUNTRY. AM I RIGHT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE AMERICAN PUBLIC! I DON'T WANT TO INSULT TIME! THEY'RE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC! THEY'RE ONE OF THE TOP THREE PUBLICS IN AMERICA! (LAUGHTER) I'M JUST SAYING THAT IF THESE TERRIBLE NOT UNGUN RELATED  STORIES CREATE SINUS PRESSURE IN YOUR HEAD AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET YOURSELF SOME SUDAFED TO  EASE THAT SINUS PAIN, THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO TO GET SUDAFED. TO GET THAT GOOD SUDAFED YOU NEED I.D. AND THERE'S A BACKGROUND CHECK AND THEN YOU'VE  GOT TO SIGN (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) SUDAFED I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IS SOME DANGEROUS (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) SO WHILE WE ALSO TALK ABOUT SOCIETAL FACTORS AND MORAL FACTORS, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD  ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONRY...
TOO EARLY TO BE TALKING ABOUT MORE GUN CONTROL LAWS?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: LOOK, TEN YEARS AFTER 9/11 I CAN'T STILL FLY WITH A FULL CONTAINER OF (BLEEP)ING SHAMPOO! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S RIGHT, I USE THE SAME SHAMPOO AS MY DRESSAGE HORSES. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S TOO SOON TO EVEN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT? YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT TO DISCUSS THE EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR  THAT THERE IS A WAITING PERIOD? YEAH, I GUESS YOU'D HATE TO GO INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS ALL HOT-HEADED. (LAUGHTER) SAY SOMETHING IMPULSIVELY YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE BACK. LOOK, THIS IS THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF IT. EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE. ANYTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY HELP MITIGATE THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS. I'M NOT EVEN SAYING GUN CONTROL WOULD DO IT. I'M JUST SAYING IT'S GOT TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT SHOWS THIS COUNTRY'S PROBLEM-SOLVING MECHANISM IS NOT  IRREVOCABLY DAMAGED?
SHOULD COSTUMES BE BANNED FROM MOVIE THEATERS? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALL RIGHT, DIDN'T REALIZE... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I STAND CORRECTED. PROBLEM SOLVED. (LAUGHTER) THERE IS ONE AREA OF THIS MESS THAT I THINK IS ALSO WORTHY OF COMMENT. AND IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW EGG SYSTEM "WHAT STORY DOES A GUY HAVE TO BLOW TO GET IN  TROUBLE WITH ABC?" (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WHEN THESE TYPES OF STORIES OCCUR NEWS  ORGANIZATIONS ARE SCRAMBLING TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE EVENT.
I WANT TO GO TO BRIAN ROSS WHO'S BEEN INVESTIGATING THE BACKGROUND OF JIM HOLMES. YOU FOUND SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT.
Jon: OOH! THAT'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ANCHORING THE COVERAGE, THROWING TO HIS COLLEAGUE BRIAN ROSS WHO  FOUND SOMETHING... I BELIEVE GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS USED THE PHRASE "THAT MIGHT BE  SIGNIFICANT." GO!
THERE'S A JIM HOLMES IN THE AURORA TEA PARTY SITE TALKING  ABOUT HIM JOINING THE TEA PARTY LAST YEAR. WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE SAME JIM HOLMES, BUT IT'S A JIM HOLMES OF ROERZ, COLORADO. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: OBVIOUSLY CORRECT RESPONSE TO THAT STATEMENT IS BRIAN, I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU  HAD SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT! (LAUGHTER) NOT "HEY, GEORGE, LET ME INTERRUPT YOU, I PUT THE NAME JAMES HOLMES INTO MY SEARCH  ENGINE AND HIT THE "I'M FEELING LAZY BUTTON." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  OF COURSE STEPHANOPOULOS IS IN THE MIDDLE... STEPHANOPOULOS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF DOING A LOT OF  THINGS AND I'M ASSUMING HE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT BRIAN ROSS CHECKED OUT THIS (BLEEP)  HE'S SAYING ON AIR BEFORE SAYING IT. BECAUSE BRIAN ROSS IS THE CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT AND NOT, LET'S SAY, THE OFFICE GOSSIP. (LAUGHTER) YEAH, JIM HUMS AND HE'S TOTALLY A PORN STAR AND I... (LAUGHTER) I'M JUST... GEORGE, I'M JUST SAYING THE KILLER IS A PORN STAR. (LAUGHTER) OH, WAIT, I'M SORRY, THAT'S TOTALLY JOHN HOLMES BUT, UM, WHATEVER. (LAUGHTER) SO OF COURSE TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER...
AN EARLIER REPORT THAT I HAD WAS INCORRECT THAT HE WAS CONNECTED WITH THE TEA PARTY IN  FACT, THAT'S A DIFFERENT JIM HOLMES. HE IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE TEA PARTY.
Jon: AND? AND?
AND WHAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE'S A 24-YEAR-OLD WHITE  MALE WHO WENT TO COLORADO FOR A Ph.D..
Jon: NO. NO. THE AND "I AM REALLY (BLEEP)ING SORRY." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) "REALLY SORRY. DEEPLY SORRY." (APPLAUSE) "DEEPLY, IRREVOCABLY SORRY TO THE INNOCENT MAN THAT I CASUALLY  BASELESSLY, AND PUBLICLY ACCUSED OF, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE BEING A MASS MURDERER."  (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GOOGLING HIS NAME I SAW THE NAME "THE TEA  PARTY" AND I THOUGHT "OOH, THAT'S AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE, I SHOULD GET THAT ON THE T.V." (LAUGHTER) THIS KILLER MAY HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE TEA PARTY. WHO GIVES A (BLEEP)? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? WHY IS THAT? HU? GEORGE, TEA PARTY? LOW TAXES? MAD MEN? (LAUGHTER) YOU DO THE MATH. (LAUGHTER) NO HARM, NO FOUL, RIGHT? EXCEPT HARM! (LAUGHTER) AND THIS DUDE ISN'T EVEN GROUNDD? DOESN'T GET DETENTION? YOU'RE ABC! SENTENCE HIM TO "WIPEOUT." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR SEGMENT  "CAN A BROTHER GET A
