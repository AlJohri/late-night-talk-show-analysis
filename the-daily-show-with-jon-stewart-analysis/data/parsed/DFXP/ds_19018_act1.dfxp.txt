Jon:  I'M JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, JOHN GOODMAN. JOHN GOODMAN GOING TO BE JOINING US. BEFORE WE START BRIEF UPDATE ON A STORY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY, TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD TODAY CLARIFIED HIS EARLIER DENIALS HE HAD BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO SMOKING CRACK COCAINE CLARIFYING BY ADMITTING HE HAD IN FACT BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO TAPE SMOKING CRACK COCAINE.
YES, I WAS SMOKING CRACK COCAINE. DO I? AM I AN ADDICT? HAVE I TRIED IT. PROBABLY IN ONE OF MY DRUNKEN STUPORS. YOU'RE NOT HELPING. A CRACK USER. I'M A SOCIAL CRACK USER. WHEN I DRINK I SMOKE A LITTLE CRACK. OBVIOUSLY TODAY MIRED IN SCANDAL AND DISGRACE HE DID THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR HIM TO DO.
I WAS ELECTED TO DO A JOB AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE DOING. ON OCTOBER 27TH, OF 2014, I WANT THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT ROB FORD TO BE THEIR MAYOR. [LAUGHTER]
THIS GUY HAS HUGE BALLS. [BLEEP] YOUR SISTER. I'M GOING TO STAY MARRIED TO YOU? [LAUGHTER]
I'M HOPING TO CONTINUE [BLEEP]. IN LIGHT OF THIS RECENT SCANDAL, MAYOR FORD HAS LOOKED DEEP WITHIN HIMSELF AND DECIDED, AH, GOOD. I'M GOING TO RUN FOR REELECTION. MAYOR FORD, MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE. [LAUGHTER] YOU NEED HELP. AND I DON'T MEAN HELP CARRYING A CASE OF BEER DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT SO YOU CAN GET DRUNK ENOUGH TO SMOKE CRACK. I MEAN HELP HELP. LET'S JUST TALK TO TORONTO FOR A SECOND. YOU CAN GO. LOOK THERE'S SOME CRACK. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALONE NOW.  I HEARD THAT MAYOR FORD'S APPROVAL RATINGS WENT UP AFTER IT CAME OUT THAT HE SMOKED CRACK. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MAKES YOU AS THE CITY OF TORONTO? ENABLERS, EH. NOW LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. ARE YOU WAITING FOR THIS MAN TO HIT ROCK BOTTOM. ARE YOU WAITING FOR HIM TO WHAT TEXT PICTURES OF HIS [BLEEP]
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS, I DON'T KNOW YOU, I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR CITY. MAYOR FORD'S A LOT OF FUN TO RIDICULE. BUT MY GUESS IS NOT A LOT OF FUN TO EULOGIZE AND THAT'S WHERE THIS THING'S HEADED. NOW EVEN THOUGH I WILL LOSE PRECIOUS MATERIAL, PLEASE GO TO REHAB. [LAUGHTER] WILL I LOSE JOKES IN THE SHORT TERM, OF COURSE. BUT MY GUESS IS IT'S A LONG TERM INVESTMENT. [LAUGHTER] YOU'LL BE BACK. GET SOME HELP.
NOW HERE IN THE STATES WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT SOME OF THE FINE PRINT ON OUR NEW HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW THERE'S TALK THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS LESS THAN A HUNDRED PERCENT HONEST WITH THE RHETORIC.
IF YOU LIKE YOUR CURRENT PLAN, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP IT.
DID HE JUST SAY IF WE LIKE OUR CURRENT PLAN, WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP IT.
LET ME REPEAT THAT. IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP IT. [LAUGHTER]
I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT YOU SAID. IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTOR.
WANT TO ADD ANY CAVEATS TO THAT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS DEFINITIVE.
WE WILL KEEP THIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. PERIOD. IF YOU LIKE YOUR HEALTHCARE PLAN, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR HEALTHCARE PLAN. PERIOD.
PERIOD. [LAUGHTER] FIRST OF ALL I DO NOT THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO READ THE PUNCTUATION IN THE SPEECHES. [LAUGHTER] I'M PRETTY SURE. HOW WOULD THE DEFINITIVE STATEMENT SOUND POST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTHCARE ACT WHEN IT'S ABUNDANTLY COOL YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR PLAN OR YOUR DOCTOR.
IF YOU HAD OR HAVE ONE OF THESE PLANS BEFORE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CAME INTO LAW, AND YOU REALLY LIKE THAT PLAN. WHAT WE SAID WAS YOU COULD KEEP IT. IF IT HASN'T CHANGED SINCE THE LAW'S PASSED.
WELL, NO, NO, NO. NO, WHAT YOU SAID WAS, YOU CAN KEEP IT. PERIOD. NOW WHAT YOU SAID, WHAT YOU SAID THERE WAS MORE LIKE YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HEALTHCARE PLAN ELLIPSES COMMA BECAUSE IT MAY NO LONGER MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OR YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY MAY NOT BE EXTENDING YOUR PLAN. PERIOD. EMOTICON DENOTING A  COMBINATION OF EMBARRASSMENT AND ARROGANCE. DID I DO THAT. SO. YES THE PRESIDENT WAS SOMEWHAT DISHONEST. SOMEWHAT DISHONEST ABOUT THE PROMISE OF HIS HEALTHCARE PROGRAM. BUT HERE'S THE WEIRD PART. HIS OPPONENTS HAVE BEEN LYING LIKE [BLEEP] ABOUT ITS EFFECTS.
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OBAMACARE WILL INCREASE TAXES OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS AND ADD $6 TRILLION TO THE DEFICIT.
WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY $20,000 IN PREMIUMS NEXT YEAR. AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE INSURANCE FOR OUR DAUGHTER WHO HAS A PREEXISTING CONDITION.
$95 FINE THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE IN ORDER TO AVOID PRISON TIME OR WHATEVER RAMIFICATIONS.
VLADIMIR LENIN HE SAID SOCIALIZED MEDICINE IS THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH TO THE SOCIALIST STATE.
OBAMACARE IS REALLY I THINK THE WORST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS NATION SINCE SLAVERY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OK HE'S DISHONEST BUT IT IS SORT OF WEIRD IF THAT IS THE WORST LAW KNOWN TO MAN KIND, SO MANY PEOPLE NEED TO STRETCH THE TRUTH TO ATTACK IT. IF SOMETHING'S GENERALLY BAD TELLING THE TRUTH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT. THERE'S A REASON 12 YEARS A SLAVE DOESN'T HAVE VAMPIRES AND ZOMBIES. [LAUGHTER] NOT TO MENTION SOME ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.
THE POINT IS WHO SHOULD SET MINIMUM. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHY SHOULD SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON TELL ME I HAVE TO HAVE THESE TEN ITEMS IN EVERY PLAN, TEN ESSENTIAL BENEFITS. IT'S LIKE PASSING THE LAW THE ONLY CAR YOU CAN BUY IS A FULLY LOADED CADILLAC. WHAT IF YOU CAN ONLY AFFORD A HONDA.
Jon:  SO YOUR POINT IS WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT SET TEN STANDARDS FOR HEALTHCARE WHEN THEY DON'T SET TEN STANDARDS FOR CARS. WHAT? THIS IS THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR AUTOMOBILES. [LAUGHTER] THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SETS AT LEAST 50 STANDARD ITEMS THAT MUST BE IN EITHER A CADILLAC OR A HONDA IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE REFERRED TO AS A CAR. [LAUGHTER] SO MY GUESS IS YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND SOME PEOPLE WHO DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THIS LAW AND SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY BURDENED BY THIS LAW. DON'T PRETEND THAT THE OLD SYSTEM WAS COCOON. WE WON'T EVER GET OLD AND WE WON'T EVER DIE. SERIOUSLY MAN [BLEEP] BEFORE SUCKED. I GIVE YOU THE SHANGRILA OF THE LAW BEFORE  OBAMACARE.
I HAD A BILL FOR $180,000.
BLUE SHIELD REJECTED ME.
BACKLOG AND IMPROPERLY DENIED CLAIMS ENCOURAGING ITS EMPLOYEES TO DROP POLICY HOLDERS AND ACTUALLY PAYING BONUSES BASED ON HOW MUCH MONEY THE COMPANY SAVED. THOSE WERE THE DAYS.
Jon:    AND YOU KNOW ♪ YOU WERE THEN ♪ [LAUGHTER] I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT SOME OF THESE NEW CASES. YOU KNOW WHO IS GETTING THESE INSURANCE POLICIES PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM? IT'S NOT WEALTHY PEOPLE. BUT YOU CAN'T PULL THAT CONCERN [BLEEP] WHEN THIS IS THE WAY YOU ACTED TO THE MILLIONS WITHOUT INSURANCE IN THE OLD SYSTEM.
I'M NOT SURE WHY WE NEED TO REVAMP S MULTITRILLION DOLLAR SYSTEM TO TAKE CARE OF A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.
A HANDFUL OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IF YOU LIKE NOT HAVING A DOCTOR YOU GOT TO KEEP NOT HAVING A DOCTOR. PERIOD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
