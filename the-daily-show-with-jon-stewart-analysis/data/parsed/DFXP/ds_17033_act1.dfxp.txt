DECEMBER 12, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. CELEBRITY CHEF ANNE BUEHRLE. SHE'S GOT A GOOD ONE. I'M BEING TOLD IT'S CALLED COOK LIKE A ROCK STAR. I REALLY SHOULD LOOK AT THESE MORE CAREFULLY. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. ON SATURDAY NIGHT IT BROUGHT THE REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS TO AN ABC DEBATE IN DES MOINES, IOWA, IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SET OF A STAR TREK CHRISTMAS SPECIAL FOR THE  BATTLE ROYALE BETWEEN GINGRICH AND ROMNEY. GINGRICH THE LATEST CANDIDATE TO OCCUPY THE CENTER STAGE SPOT ALONGSIDE ROMNEY  FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ONE MICHELE BACHMANN, ONE RICK PERRY, AND ONE HERMAN CAIN. VANQUISHED ALL OF THEM EARLY ON. GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS HANDED MITT ROMNEY AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE SAME WITH GINGRICH.
SPEAKER GINGRICH AND I HAVE A LOT OF PLACES WHERE WE DISAGREE. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE.
NAME THEM.
PLACES WHERE WE DISAGREE? LET'S SEE.
Jon: UMM. OKAY. I WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE $1.6 MILLION THAT GINGRICH TOOK FROM FREDDIE MAC WHILE  THE HOUSING BUBBLE WAS GOING ON. I NEVER HAD TO PAY $300,000 TO SETTLE CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS. I NEVER SHUT DOWN DOWN THE GOVERNMENT BASED ON A SUB OPTIMAL SEATING ASSIGNMENT. I NEVER MENACED MANHATTAN UNTIL I WAS DEFEATED BY THREE COMIC GENIUSES AND ERNIE HUDSON. ROMNEY, YOU HAVE THIS ALL IN THE BAG. YOU ARE GOING TO CRUSH GINGRICH. GO.
PLACES WHERE WE DISAGREE. LET'S SEE. WE COULD START WITH HIS IDEA TO HAVE A LUNAR COLONY THAT WOULD MINE MINERALS FROM THE MOON.
Jon: WHAT? WHAT? WE START WITH THE LUNAR MINE IDEA. ROMNEY, NEWT GINGRICH IS A LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR BAD IDEAS. AND YOU MAGICALLY REACH IN AND PICK OUT HIS ONE AWESOME IDEA. PRESIDENT GINGRICH, THE ALIENS ARE REBELING IN THE MOON MINE. WHEN WE SHUT DOWN SECTOR 4. A SWING AND A MISS, ROMNEY. NEWT.
LET'S BE CANDID. THE ONLY REASON YOU DIDN'T BECOME A CAREER POLITICIAN IS YOU LOST TO TEDDY KENNEDY IN 1994.
NOW, WAIT A SECOND.
Jon: DOWN GOES ROMNEY. HOLY (BEEP). THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY IT. SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T LIKE MY MOON MINES IDEA. PERHAPS I COULD INTEREST YOU IN A FRESHLY MINTED (BEEP) YOURSELF. OF COURSE, WHILE GINGRICH AND ROMNEY ARE BATTLING IT OUT, RON PAUL WAS KILLING IT. KNOCKING 'EM DOWN ONE BY ONE.
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM AND WE WOULDN'T  BE INVADING THE PRIVACY OF EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS COUNTRY WITH BILLS LIKE THE PATRIOT ACT. WE'D HAVE A FREE SOCIETY AND A PROSPEROUS SOCIETY.
Jon: MINES ON EVERY PLANET. HOW WELL DID RON PAUL DO? THE MEDIA THAT NORMALLY ACTS LIKE RON PAUL IS WEARING THE CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY ACTUALLY  INVITED HIM ON TO ONE OF THEM SUNDAY TALK SHOWS. FINALLY. RESPECT.
DID NEWT GINGRICH DO ANYTHING TO DIMINISH HIS CHANCES IN IOWA LAST NIGHT?
ARE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE WITH ROMNEY AS THE STANDARD BEARER OF THE PARTY.
DO YOU CONSIDER BOTH GINGRICH AND ROMNEY UNACCEPTABLE AS CONSISTENT CONSERVATIVES?
WILL YOU ENDORSE....
Jon: HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT SATURDAY NIGHT? I KNOW THIS QUIET LITTLE PLACE WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHICH ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS I'D RATHER (BEEP). STILL, THE DAY AFTER THE DEBATE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE TOPIC ON ANYONE'S MIND. IT WASN'T RON PAUL OR GINGRICH'S SLAM ON MITT ROMNEY. IT WAS THIS.
I READ YOUR FIRST BOOK. IT SAID IN THERE THAT YOUR MANDATE IN MASSACHUSETTS, WHICH SHOULD BE THE MODEL FOR THE COUNTRY. I KNOW IT CAME OUT OF THE REPRINT OF THE BOOK. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING YOU REFER TO INDIVIDUAL MANDATES, MY FRIEND.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'VE RAISED THAT BEFORE, RICK.
IT WAS TRUE THEN. IT IS TRUE NOW.
RICK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. $10,000. A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BET.
I'M NOT IN THE BETTING BUSINESS.
OKAY.
Jon: THIS IS AWESOME. A MORMON GAMBLING WITH AN EVANGELICAL OVER WHO IS THE BIGGER LIAR. ARE THERE ANY COMMANDMENTS LEFT? WITH MORE ON ROMNEY'S $10,000 BET, WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN  OLIVER IN IOWA. THANKS FOR JOINING US. WHY IS EVERYONE MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS $10,000 BET THING.
ONE, JON, BECAUSE IT FEEDS INTO THE PRE-EXISTING NARRATIVE ABOUT MITT ROMNEY  BEING AN OUT OF TOUCH MULTI-MILLIONAIRE. WHEN ROMNEY RAN THE BUY-OUT FIRM, EVERYTHING ABOUT ROMNEY TELLS THE TALE OF A MAN WHO  JUST FIRED YOUR DAD. THIS IS NOT A NARRATIVE, JON, THAT THE PRESS INVENTED. LOOK AT HIS THIRD GRADE CLASS PICTURE. HIS HAIR IS EXACTLY THE SAME, JON. WHAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLD HAS GRAYING TEMPLES?
Jon: WHAT ABOUT NEWT GINGRICH? HE HAS A PERSONAL NET WORTH FROM LAST YEAR I THINK LIKE $6- $7 MILLION. A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR TAB AT TIFFANY'S.
MONEY ISN'T GINGRICH'S NARRATIVE. IT'S THE INFIDELITY GUY. HIS PROBLEM IS OATHS. HE CAN FLAUNT HIS WEALTH ALL HE LIKES. WHAT HE CAN'T DO IS PROMISE TO BE AMERICA'S PRESIDENT FOR RICHER OR POORER AND  DEFINITELY NOT IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH. WITHOUT EVOKING IMAGES OF PRESIDENT GINGRICH GETTING BORED OF US AND MESSING AROUND  WITH A YOUNGER COUNTRY BEHIND OUR BACK.
Jon: SO GINGRICH IS SAYING
THAT'S RIGHT. EVERY CANDIDATE HAS AN ACHILLE'S HEEL, THAT SPOT WHEN THEY WERE DIPPED INTO INDESTRUCT I  BELIEVE CAMPAIGN JUICE WAS LEFT UNCOVERED LEAVING THEM VULNERABLE.
Jon: I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY ACHILLY'S MOM DIDN'T DIP HIM  TWICE MAKING SURE SHE COVERED THE HEEL.
YOU CAN'T DOUBLE DIP, JON. IT'S RUDE TO THE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE BEHIND YOU.
Jon: JUST ONE DIP AND A LITTLE LADLE. I MEAN THE WHOLE THING IS DONE. IT'S NOT A SECOND DIP. I'M JUST SAYING....
THAT'S TWO DIPS, JON.
Jon: IT'S AN EASY DIP.
YOU'RE BONKERS, PLEASE.
Jon: WHAT'S RICK PERRY'S ACHILLY'S HEEL?
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
Jon: YOU JUST SAID EVERY....
RICK PERRY HAS AN ACHILLE'S HEAD.
THE IDEA THAT THIS PRESIDENT NOW WITH IRAN GETTING ONE OF OUR PREDATOR  DRONES IN THEIR POSSESSION AND HE HAD TWO OPPORTUNITIES OR HE DIDN'T HAVE TWO OPPORTUNITIES, HE HAD TWO CHOICES, ACTUALLY HE HAD THREE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PERRY? YOU KNOW THAT LISTING THINGS IN THREEs IS OFF LIMITS TO YOU. NUMBER IN ANY FORM REALLY. IF YOU HAVE TO LIST STUFF, DO IT WITH LETTERS.
Jon: HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR NARRATIVE THEN?
YOU DON'T, JON. YOU EMBRACE IT. UNFORTUNATELY ROMNEY IS NO GOOD AT THAT.
THIS WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS NUMBER TO ANSWER, AN OUTRAGEOUS CHARGE FROM HIM. IT'S BEEN PROVEN WRONG TIME AND TIME AGAIN. I SAID OKAY LET'S PUT SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS OUT. IT'S LIKE SAYING, HEY, I'LL BET YOU A MILLION BUCKS.
EXCEPT HE DIDN'T SAY A MILLION BUCKS, DID HE? HE SAID $10,000. IF HE HAD SAID A MILLION BUCKS HE STILL HAS 200 OF THOSE. THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THIS, JON. IF HE REALLY WANTS TO SHAKE RICK PERRY UP, HE HAS TO EMBRACE THE RICH DOUCHE WITHIN.
Jon: HOW? HOW DOES ONE DO THAT?
JUST LOOK RICK PERRY IN THE EYE AND SAY, "HEY, RICK, YOU  KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TO YOU? I'M GOING TO BUY UP ALL THE LAND AROUND YOUR FAMILY'S HOUSE AND THEN BUILD FACTORIES  THAT LEAK ETHER INTO YOUR WATER SUPPLY. SURE, THE EPA WILL FIGHT IT, RICK, BUT I'LL HIRE SO MANY LAWYERS THAT THEY'LL BE FORCED TO GIVE UP THE CASE OR GO BANKRUPT. AND THEN I'LL WALK INTO YOUR POISONED HOUSE IN FRONT OF YOUR CHOKING FAMILY WHO CAN'T  GET UP TO HELP US BECAUSE THEIR GENES ARE NOW MUTATING, THEIR LEGS CAN'T SUPPORT THEIR WEIGHT AND I WILL STRANGLE YOU TO DEATH. WHY WILL I DO THIS? BECAUSE I'M RICH, RICK. AND THIS IS THE KIND OF (BEEP) THAT RICH PEOPLE CAN DO." ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: EMBRACE IT?
YEAH. AND THEN MITT ROMNEY'S GOT TO LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA AND SAY TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE, "VOTE FOR ME. YOU HAVE NO (BEEP) IDEA WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF."
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
