[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SECRETARY KATHLEEN SEBELIUS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: WE'RE GOING TO DO A CHALLENGE. I'M GOING TO TRY AND DOWNLOAD EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE AND YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMACARE AND WE'LL SEE WHICH HAPPENS FIRST.
OKAY. OKAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS? IS THIS WORKING? IS IT NOT WORKING?
WELL, THE GREAT NEWS IS, WE HAVE A TERRIFIC MARKET. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO COMPARE PLANS, FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY QUALIFY FOR. INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO PLAY BY NEW RULES AND FOR 85% OF US WE DON'T HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE WE HAVE INSURANCE THAT WORKS.
Jon: I SEE. THIS OBAMACARE IS FOR THE 15 PERCENTERS AS IT WERE.
THE 15% WITHOUT INSURANCE AT ALL OR --
Jon: HOW MANY HAVE SIGNED UP THUS FAR?
FULLY ENROLLED. I CAN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE TAKING APPLICATIONS ON THE WEB, ON THE PHONE. WE'LL BE GIVING MONTHLY REPORTS. WE'VE HAD NOT ONLY LOTS OF WEB HITS, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACCOUNTS CREATED.
Jon: SO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP?
OF ACCOUNTS CREATED WHICH MEANS THAT THEN THEY ARE GOING TO GO SHOPPING. JON THIS IS LIKE --
Jon: WHAT? THIS IS LIKE A KAYAK SITE WHERE YOU CHECK OUT WHAT PLANE YOU WANT TO GET ON. THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT TODAY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE INSURANCE BY THE 15th OF DECEMBER TO HAVE A PLAN THAT STARTS IN JANUARY.
Jon: THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS. A LEGITIMATE CRITICISM OF THIS IS THAT BUSINESSES WERE GIVEN A DELAY OF A YEAR BUT INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT GIVEN THAT OPTION. WHY IS THAT?
WELL BUSINESS OWNERS WITH MORE THAN 50 EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S THE ONLY BUSINESS OWNERS WITH ANY RESPONSIBILITY. 95% OF THEM ARE IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. A DELAY DOESN'T CHANGE THE MARKET NUMBERS. INDIVIDUALS HAVE TAX CREDITS COMING THEIR WAY. HAVE FINANCIAL HELP FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE MARKET THAT WE ARE NOW RUNNING --
Jon: RIGHT.
-- IS AVAILABLE FOR THEM. THAT DOESN'T DELAY THAT DIDN'T STOP. WE KNOW ABOUT SIX OUT OF TEN PEOPLE WILL GET A POLICY FOR UNDER $100 A MONTH. NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN'T TURN ANYBODY AWAY WITH A PREEXISTING CONDITION.
Jon: IF I'M AN INDIVIDUAL I'M WONDERING, WELL, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOESN'T WANT THIS. THERE INDIVIDUALS CLEARLY THAT WANT THIS BUT IF I'M AN INDIVIDUAL THAT DOESN'T WANT THIS IT'S HARD FOR ME TO LOOK AT A BIG BUSINESS GETTING A WAIVER AND NOT HAVING TO DO THIS AND ME HAVING TO BECAUSE I WOULD THINK, GEEZ, IT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LOBBYING GROUP -- NOT THAT I DON'T HAVE A LOBBYING GROUP, BELIEVE ME, I HAVE A LOBBYING GROUP. I WOULD FEEL LIKE YOU ARE FAVORING BIG BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY LOBBIED YOU TO DELAY IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THIS YEAR BUT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS THE SAME COURTESY.
AGAIN, BIG BUSINESSES ARE  ALREADY IN THE HEALTH MARKET.
Jon: THAT'S WHERE 85% OF THE PEOPLE ARE, YES?
THAT'S WHERE 85% OF THE PEOPLE GET THEIR INSURANCE NOW. THEY WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT, BIG BUSINESS. THEY ARE IN. SMALL EMPLOYERS HAVE NO MANDATE AT ALL. NOT NOW, NOT IN THE FUTURE.
Jon: UNDERNEATH 50 EMPLOYEES.
UNDER 50 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. THE NEW MARKET GIVES THEM ADDITIONAL SHOPPING TOOLS.
Jon: ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW IT HAS ONE OPTION?
NO, IT HAS, BUSINESS OWNERS ARE ABLE TO MAKE CHOICES. WHAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR IS EMPLOYEES IN A SMALL MOM AND POP SHOP CAN'T CHOOSE FROM 14 DIFFERENT PLANS.
Jon: THEY GET ONE.
IT IS -- IF YOU RUN YOUR OWN SHOP --
Jon: WOULD YOU SAY IT'S A LEGITIMATE CRITICISM THAT AN INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T GET TO DELAY IT BUT A BUSINESS DOES?
NOTHING THAT HELPS AN INDIVIDUAL GET HEALTH INSURANCE HAS BEEN DELAYED AT ALL. THEY CAN. THEY GET THE TAX CREDIT THIS YEAR. THEY HAVE PLANS TO CHOOSE FROM.
Jon: SO YOU ARE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE SUBSIDIES READY FOR THE BUSINESSES?
THE BUSINESSES DON'T GET SUBSIDIES THEY ARE JUST GOING TO --
Jon: THEY DELAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GETTING EXTRA MONEY BUT INDIVIDUALS DON'T BECAUSE THEY WILL?
AGAIN, THEY ARE IN THE MARKET ALREADY.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  AM I A STUPID MAN? I DON'T THINK SO. I DON'T THINK SO. BUT PEOPLE WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FINALLY HAVE A MARKET TO CHOOSE FROM.
Jon: THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS. PEOPLE THAT WANT THIS FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO GET IT. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A GOOD THING. BUT IF YOU ARE SOMEONE LIKE ME YOU THINK HEALTH CARE SHOULDN'T BE IN A MARKET-BASED SOLUTION BECAUSE HEALTH CARE DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO MARKET-BASED SOLUTIONS IBECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T SHOP FORNS HOSPITALS.
THEY CAN NOW.
Jon: PEOPLE CAN SHOP FOR INSURANCE.
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IF YOUR DOCTOR IS IN THE PLAN THAT YOU WANT. IF THE NETWORK OF HOSPITALS IS IN THE PLAN YOU WANT. WHAT KIND OF DRUG YOU TAKE IS THAT IN THE PLAN YOU WANT. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT BEFORE. I'M A RECOVERING INSURANCE COMMISSIONER.
Jon: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT WITH REGULAR INSURANCE COMPANIES? YOU CAN'T SHOP AROUND?
WOULD YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS THERE. YOU MIGHT DEAL WITH ONE AGENT OR BROKER. THIS IS SIDE BY SIDE TRANSPARENT.
Jon: THIS THE FIRST MALL CREATED?
YOU BET.
Jon: WHY IS IT THAT INDIVIDUALS COULDN'T SAY THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT FOR A YEAR.
THEY CAN. THEY PAY A FINE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. THEY CAN SAY I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THE THEORY IS THEY CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE IF THEY ARE HIT BY A BUS OR DIAGNOSED WITH AN ILLNESS. FOR A LOT OF YOUNG FOLKS THEY ARE ONE FALL ON THE BASKETBALL COURT, ONE AUTO ACCIDENT AWAY FROM A LIFETIME OF HOSPITAL BILLS THEY CAN'T PAY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: STILL NOT SURE WHY INDIVIDUALS CAN'T DELAY CAN WE COME BACK AND ASK MORE QUESTIONS?
SURE.
Jon: CAN I ASK THE SAME ONE?
IF YOU WANT TO.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE FROM SECRETARYACK SEBELIUS
