[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. WE TURN NOW --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE TURN NOW AS WE DO EVERY TUESDAY TO LITVINENKO RAREY NEWS -- LITERARY NEWS. WE TURN TO MARK TWAIN'S BELOVED ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY PHINN. WE'VE ALL READ THE BOOK. I'M SURE THERE'S QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE STORY. YES, CBS NEWS.
ON ONE PAGE OF HUCK FINN TWAIN WROTE THE N WORD SIX TIMES. SHOULD EACH ONE BE EDITED OUT AND REPLACED WITH THE WORD SLAVE.
Jon: I FEEL LIKE THAT MAY BE A TRICK QUESTION. I FEEL LIKE REALLY ANY ANSWER I GIVE IS GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE. THE PUBLISHER SAYS YES, THE NEW SOUTH EDITION AIMS TO APPEASE OF SENSITIVITYIES OF MODERN READERS  BY REPLACING THE WORD WITH THE WORD SLAVE. HERE WITH HIS PERSPECTIVE SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WIL WILMORE. LARRY.
THANK YOU, JON. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PROMOTION, JIM. THIS IS SAY HUGE UPGRADE FROM ANYTHINGER TO SLAVE. THAT'S -- NIGGER TO SLAVE. IT'S LIKE A SHOW GOING FROM THE WB TO UPN.
Jon: THE EDITORS OF THIS NEW VERSION ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE BOOK MORE ACCESSIBLE, THEY  SAY, SO THAT IT CAN BE TAUGHT WITHOUT MAKING STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM WHO MAY BE  UNCOMFORTABLE REPEAT THE WORD NN --
SORRY?
Jon: SO THAT THE CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO SAY IN THE CLASS SAY THE NNFN --
SORRY JON, WHAT WORD.
Jon: NNN.
SAY IT, JON.
Jon: IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT SHOULD BE. MARK TWAIN PUT THAT WORD IN FOR A REASON. THE N WORD SPEAKS TO A SOCIETY THAT CASUALLY DEHUMANIZED BLACK PEOPLE. SLAVE WAS JUST A JOB DESCRIPTION. [LAUGHTER] AND IT'S NOT EVEN AK REUT. JIM IS NO LONGER A SLAVE. HE RAN AWAY. TWAIN'S SAYING HE CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM BEING A NIGGER. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: YOU HAVE TO BE PRETTY FAST, I WOULD --  [LAUGHTER]
NICE ONE, JON. NICE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, A LOT OF HIGH SCHOOLS WERE REFUSING TO TEACH THE BOOK AT ALL BECAUSE OF  THE WORDS. ISN'T THIS MINOR CHANGE A WAY TO EXPOSE MORE KIDS TO GOOD LITERATURE.
YEAH, BUT IT'S BAD HISTORY. AS LONG AS YOU ARE CHANGING THINGS DON'T STOP THERE. HUCK AND JIM LOOK SO POOR. THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE OFFENSIVE. THAT'S BETTER. THERE YOU GO. GET THEM OUT OF THOSE DIRTY CLOTHES. YOU KNOW, MAN AND A BY ALONE KIND OF CREEPY. MAKE HUCK A HOT GIRL. CLOTHES. PERFECT. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, JON, SEE JIM IS NOT A SLAVE, HE IS THE KING OF THE WORLD. YOU KNOW (bleep) IT TURN THEM BOTH INTO TALKING ANIMALS. THERE YOU GO. WHO COULD BE AVENDORRED BY THE -- AOWNED BY -- OFFENDED BY THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY  TURTLE AND NIGGER RABBIT?
Jon: JUST A SIMPLE CURIOSITY FOR ME HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH ANIMAL IS --
YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
LOOK, USING THAT WORD DOESN'T MAKE THE BOOK OFFENSIVE TO TODAY'S KIDS. THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO IT. IF YOU WANT KIDS TO PICK UP A BOOK, EMPHASIZE THAT WORD. PIMP THE COVER. [LAUGHTER] YEAH. SEE LOOK -- YOU'VE GOT A GIRL -- SAY IT'S WRITTEN BY LIL TWAIN. IT WILL BE A YOUNG ADULT BEST SELLER. LEAVE JIM ALONE.
Jon: YOU ARE PASSIONATE IN YOUR DEFENSE OF THE CHARACTER, JIM.
I HAVE TO BE, JON, OR THEY WOULD TAKE THE BROTHER OUT OF THE BOOK COMPLETELY. THEY TRIED. THEY MADE A TV MOVIE VERSION IN THE 1950'S THAT DID AWAY WITH THE JIM CHARACTER COMPLETELY. THAT IS DENNIS THE MENACE ON A RAFT. WHAT IS (bleep) 1950'S? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHEN DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET OVER THIS TOWERING WHITEWASH OUR HISTORY?
NOT AS LONG AS THIS CONGRESS IS IN SESSION, JON. REMEMBER LAST WEEK WHEN THEY READ THE CONSTITUTION OUT LOUD THEY CHOSE TO LEAVE OUT THE  CLAUSE DESIGNATING SLAVES AS THREE-FIFTHS OF A PERSON. IT'S OUR HISTORY. JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE EMBARRASSED TO BE CAUGHT ON C-SPAN READING  IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T HANDLE IT. IT'S OKAY TO BE STEIN WITHOUT YOUR MAKEUP ON, AMERICA. PEOPLE STILL WANT TO (bleep) YOU. YOU ARE RIC
