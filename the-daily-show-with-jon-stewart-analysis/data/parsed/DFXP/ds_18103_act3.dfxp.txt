( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE WITH SENATOR OLYMPIA  SNOWE. BEFORE WE GET INTO A.R.B.,  BEFORE WE GET INTO A.R.B., YOU  WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE ABILITY TO CHANGE.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT MEANS ALL OF US, EVERYONE  OF US, HAVE TO WEIGH IN AND MAKE  SURE YOUR VOICES ARE HEARD ON CAPITOL HILL. AND DEMAND BIPARTISANSHIP AND  THAT LAWMAKERS WORK ACROSS THE  LINE AND SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. IT'S UP TO EACH OF US. YOU KNOW, THE LATE SENATOR  WARREN RUDDMAN ONCE SAID  POLITICS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE LEFT TO THE POLITICIANS. ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT, THIS  IS INTERESTING. THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON NOW  ABOUT THE A.R.B., ABOUT THE  INCIDENT IN BENGHAZI. YOU ACTUALLY HELPED WRITE THE  LEGISLATION IN, WAS IT THE  '80s OR THE '90s?
'86  Jon: THERE HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE  ATTACKS, HUNDREDS OF ATTACKS IN  THE '80s. YOU GUYS CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA  FOR THESE REVIEW BOARDS. HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT?
IT CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF  MORE THAN 200 ATTACKS ON  EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES AROUND THE WORLD DURING THE 1980s AND  SPECIFICALLY, AS YOU KNOW, THE  HORRIFIC EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN BEIRUT, OVER 283 MARINES WERE  KILLED. SO AS A RESULT WE DECIDED TO  BEEF UP SECURITY AT OUR  EMBASSIES, BOTH PHYSICALLY IN THE PERIMETERS BUT ALSO MAKING  SURE THAT WE HAD ALL THE  SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE. AND TO REBUILD
Jon: THOSE A.R.B.s HAD BEEN  EFFECTIVE IN CREATING ALL THIS. WHEN YOU SEE THIS A.R.B. THAT  WAS DONE ON BENGHAZI AND HAVING  READ THROUGH IT, IT'S SCATHING AGAINST THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
IT IS  Jon: BUT IT ALSO PROPOSES A  GOOD NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT  NEEDED TO BE MADE. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE NOT REALLY  THINKING ABOUT THOSE CHANGES  RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE STILL...
YOU KNOW, THE ISSUE AND THE  REASON AND THE GENESIS OF THAT  LEGISLATION CREATING THE ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW BOARD IS  TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST, IT WOULD  MAKE THESE, YOU KNOW,  INDISCRIMINATE DECISIONS ABOUT SECURITY MEASURES AND THEN YOU  HAD MEN AND WOMEN ON THE FRONT  LINES WHO WERE KILLED SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE  WAS STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR  PEOPLE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND THERE HAVE BEEN SECURITY  MEASURES IN PLACE AT THAT POST. SNOP ONE OF THE THEORIES WAS YOU  WANT TO GET ACCOUNTABILITY DOWN  THE LINE BECAUSE THE SECRETARY IS ALWAYS GOING TO COME OUT AND  GO, "I AM RESPONSIBLE."  THEN IT GETS PAPERED OVER. THEY WANT TO GO IN TO THE WEEDS  WITH IT AND FIND OUT EXACTLY. BUT HOW BAD ARE THE CHAIN OF  COMMAND AND COMMUNICATION ISSUES  WITHIN THESE DEPARTMENTS?
OBVIOUSLY BAD. I MEAN BECAUSE TO HAVE BENGHAZI  VULNERABLE AND EXPOSED IN A  HIGH-THREAT ENVIRONMENT, THERE WERE NUMEROUS INCIDENTS THAT HAD  ALREADY OCCURRED THAT SUMMER  AGAINST OTHER FOREIGN INTERESTS. IN FACT, A BRITISH CONVOY WAS  ATTACKED. THEY CLOSED THEIR POSTS THE VERY  NEXT DAY
Jon: THEY EVEN SAID WITHIN  THE A.R.B. BECAUSE THEY TRUSTED  THIS PARTICULAR DIPLOMAT SO WELL, THEY MAYBE LEFT HIM MORE  VULNERABLE THAN SOMEONE ELSE  BECAUSE OF HOW HIGHLY THEY REGARDED HIM.
ABSOLUTELY. AT THE TIME WE WERE CONSIDERING  INTERVENTION IN LIBYA. I RAISED THE SPECTER ABOUT HOW  WE WERE GOING TO PROVIDE  SECURITY BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO DEPEND ON THE MILITIAS WHICH  WERE UNRELIABLE, ILL EQUIPPED,  ILL TRAINED WHICH WAS THE CASE THAT NIGHT AT THAT...
Jon: THE BLUE MOUNTAIN AND  FEBRUARY 17.
IT WAS TERRIBLE. THERE WAS VIRTUALLY LITTLE  PERIMETER SECURITY. THEY WERE OVERRUN
Jon: DO YOU HAVE HOPES  THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PUSH PAST THE  POLITICAL ANGLES OF THIS AND GET TO THE MORE FOUNDATIONAL ASPECT  WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT THOSE  TYPES OF ADMINISTRATIVE MISTAKES NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT NOT  TO HAVE A PROCESS THAT IS VIEWED  OR CONVEYED IN ANYWAY AS POLITICAL, THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT  GETTING AND SEEKING THE TRUTH. BIPARTISANSHIP SHOULD BE ABOUT  SEEKING THE TRUTH.
Jon: I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS  ABOUT IT.
YOU HAVE? Jon: I'VE NEVER SEEN IT WORK. BUT I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT  IT. IN MY HISTORY BOOKS. FIGHTING FOR THE COMMON GROUND. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. SENATOR OLYMPIA SNOWE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
