Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. SO YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERYONE, I THINK WE WERE SAD YESTERDAY TO HEAR ABOUT THE PASSING OF STEVE JOBS. WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE HERE TO HAVE VISITED WITH HIM. HE WOULD COME HERE A COUPLE TIMES TO SHOW US ALL HOW WE WOULD ALL COMMUNICATE IN THE FUTURE. AND WAS NICE ENOUGH TO CALL EVERY NOW AND AGAIN AND WHEN HE THOUGHT A BIT WAS FUNNY  OR CALL EVERY NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE THOUGHT ONE WASN'T. AND BUT ALWAYS VERY CHARMING AND GENEROUS WITH HIS TIME. BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT FOR HIM TO DIE YOUNG, IT SEEMS SO STRANGE BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE  OF HIS MAGNITUDE LIKE HENRY FORD AND THOMAS EDISON, YOU SORT OF FEEL LIKE WE WRUNG  EVERYTHING OUT OF THEM. THEY WERE OLD WHEN THEY-- STEVE JOBS YOU REALLY GOT THE SENSE LIKE-- WE'RE  NOT DONE WITH YOU YET. AND IT WAS THIS SENSE THAT, YOU KNOW, SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW. WHAT'S NEXT. IT'S SORT OF LIKE AN ALIEN THAT COMES DOWN AND GIVES YOU THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND  SHOWS YOU HOW TO USE IT AND TAKES OFF IN THE SPACE SHIP AND YOU'RE LIKE WAH, WHAT'S  THIS GREEN BUTTON. STRANGE, UNUSUAL CHARACTER. AND WON'T SEE THE LIKES OF HIM FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
YOUR TIME IS LIMITED. SO DON'T WASTE IT LIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE. DON'T BE TRAPPED BY DOGMA, WHICH IS LIVING WITH THE RESULTS OF OTHER PEOPLE'S THINKING. DON'T LET THE NOISE OF OTHERS OPINIONS DROWN OUT YOUR OWN INNER VOICE. AND MOST IMPORTANT, HAVE THE COURAGE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND INTUITION
