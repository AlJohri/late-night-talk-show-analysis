MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS. NEW PUBLISHED BOOK BY AMAZON.COM IS CALLED KATRINA'S SECRETS, STORM AFTER THE STORM. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM RAY NAGIN, SIR. (APPLAUSE)
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR.
YOU KNOW, I'M GOOD, JON, HOW BUT.
I'M DOING VERY WELL.
EXPLAIN THIS TO ME THIS IS SELF-PUBLISHED.
YEAH, SELF-PUBLISHED THROUGH CREATE SPACE. HI SPOKEN WITH A COUPLE OF AGENTS AND JUST DIDN'T GET COMFORTABLE THAT MY VOICE  WOULD COME THROUGH. BECAUSE ONCE YOU TURN OVER YOUR MAN YOU SCRIPT TO A PUBLISHER YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
Jon: THEY WILL JUST TWIST IT AROUND.
THEY WANT IMMEDIATE TO TONE IT DOWN, TONE IT UP.
Jon: THERE WERE THINGS IN THERE THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AT WHEN I READ, THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE.
RIGHT.
Jon: KATHLEEN BLANCO AT THE TIME DOES NOT COME OUT WELL IN THIS BOOK REASONS REALLY? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU HAVE SEEN THE BOOK.
I'VE SEEN THE BOOK.
Jon: IT'S SELF-PUBLISHED.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU WROTE IT.
YEAH, I WROTE IT, EVERY WORD.
Jon: YOU THOUGHT SHE CAME OUT OKAY?
THERE'S A SCENE IN THE BOOK WHERE YOU DESCRIBE HER AS BECAUSE YOU SUPPORTED HER  OPPONENT BOBBY JINDAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THAT SHE SAYS IT TO YOU THIS IS LIKE  A WEEK BEFORE KATRINA, YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS. VENGENCE WILL BE MINE. I MEAN --
IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE HER RESPONSE TO NEW ORLEANS AND KATRINA WAS A PERSONAL  VENDETTA AGAINST YOU.
SHE TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE HELL TO PAY. AND I THINK KATRINA QUALIFIES.
Jon: SO YOU THINK SHE CONJURED UP THE STORM?
NO, I'M NOT SAYING SHE QON JUERED UP THE STORM. BUT I THINK THERE WERE SOME RESIDUALS.
Jon: I MEAN IS SHE-- IS SHE THAT PETTY AN INDIVIDUAL THAT SHE WOULD SAY OH, PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AT THE SUPERDOME, RAY NAGIN DOESN'T GET WATER FROM ME.
I DON'T THINK SO BUT I THINK THERE WAS SOME POLITICS PLAYED A ROLE IN  THIS, THE RESPONSE. WE HAD A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, A DEMOCRATIC-- GEM CAT GOVERNMENT NEVER AND I WAS A DEMOCRAT. THE GOVERNOR AND I DIDN'T GET DATA LONG VERY WELL BEFORE THE STORM.
Jon: LOUISIANA IS A RELATIVELY AND I SAY THIS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, DYSFUNCTIONAL. IT IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL AND SOMEWHAT, THE WORDS-- CORRUPT HAVE OFTEN.
IT'S HAD A COLOURFUL HISTORY.
Jon: WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT PARTISANSHIP PLAYED LESS IN THIS THAN MAYBE THE  POLITICAL CULTURE IN LOUISIANA.
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS GOING ON. PARTISAN POLITICS, YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNOR AND I, AND THEN THIS THING CALLED-- WHICH IS A LAW THAT WAS IN EFFECT. SO THE GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENT WERE BASICALLY DANCING AND DECIDES WHO WOULD CONTROL THE RESOURCES, WHO WOULD CONTROL THE RECOVERY. AND THAT SLOWED DOWN THE RECOVERY MORE THAN ANYTHING.
Jon: THE POINT IS THAT 24 HOUR PERIOD WHEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE PRESIDENT  MET AND HE WOULD NOT --
ON AIR FORCE ONE.
HE WOULD NOT SUPERSEDE HER AUTHORITY AND SHE --
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T BUT LATER SHE DID NOT GIVE HIM THE AUTHORITY. BUT HE TOOK IT ANYWAY A FEW DAYS LATER. SO HE HAD THE AUTHORITY ALL ALONG.
Jon: AT A CERTAIN POINT HE SAID ENOUGH.
BUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BLAME FEMA AND THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE, FOR  HIM TO IN ESSENCE SAY TO A GOVERNOR YOU SAY YOU GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL. I'LL GIVE YOU SOME BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT HERE'S WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT RESOURCES. AND THIS BLUE MY MIND. WHEN YOU DID THE MANDATORY EVACUATION AND THIS WAS ON THE SATURDAY NIGHT, SUNDAY  MORNING, SATURDAY NIGHT YOU GOT THE BAD WEATHER REPORT, SUNDAY MORNING YOU SAID I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS A MANDATORY EVACUATION.
IN THE EVACUATION NOTICE IT SAYS COME TO THE SUPERDOME IF YOU CAN'T GET OUT. BRING SUPPLIES. FOOD AND WATER.
FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS.
I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT IN A DISASTER AND THAT MIGHT BE MY IGNORANCE BUT ESPECIALLY  FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO POOR TO GET OUT, THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE LIKE LET'S  PACK OUR COOL WE ARE TURKEY AND SANDWICHES AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THAT. WHY DIDN'T THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS HAVE THE SUPERDOME STOCKED WITH WATER, RATHER  THAN RELYING ON PEOPLE TOO POOR TO GET AWAY TO, LET'S SAY, BRING THEIR OWN BOTTLED WATER.
WELL, WE DID. WE HAD SOME SUPPLIES IN THE SUPERDOME BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, WHOEVER SHOWED UP THAT THEY WOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOMETHING TO SUPPLEMENT THAT. BECAUSE WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW. WE PLANNED FOR 2 OR 3 DAYS BUT IT ENDED UP BEING 6 TO 7 DAYS BEFORE HELP REALLY CAME.
Jon: RIGHT SO IN RETROSPECT WOULD YOU SAY THOUGH THAT ALSO WAS, THAT  NEW ORLEANS ITSELF HAD NOT SERIOUSLY ENOUGH CONSIDERED THAT THE REAL RAMIFICATION  OF THIS TYPE OF TERRIBLE STORM OR DOW REALLY FEEL LIKE IT WAS --
I DON'T THINK ANYONE ANTICIPATED THAT HURRICANE KATRINA WOULD DO WHAT IT DID. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FAILURE OF THE LEVEES. KEEP IN MIND, THE FIRST REPORTS THAT CAME OUT.
Jon: THERE WERE PEOPLE SAYING THE LEVIES COULD --
THEY HAVE BEEN SAYING IT FOR 30, 40 YEARS. BUT THEY NEVER DID. SO THEY FINALLY-- .
Jon: BUT THAT'S LIKE SAYING THEY SAY THESE TORNADOES CAN TEAR UP ENTIRE  TOWNS BUT SINCE THEY DON'T, WE DECIDED NOT TO BUILD BASEMENTS AND THEN, YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU THINK IN SOME RESPECTS THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LOCAL.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, LOOK THERE WERE MISTAKES MADE ON MY PART. COY HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINGS BETTER. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SCENE THAT HAPPEN, WE GOT OUT ABOUT 96% OF THE  WILL THE PEOPLE, GOT THEM OUT OF HARM AWAY. I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER CITY HAS BEEN ABLE TO EVACUATE, I THINK IN NEW YORK TRIED TOW  VAC YATE.
Jon: WE DID, ONCE.
WHAT HAPPENED.
Jon: WE STAND BY THE WATER.
YEAH.
Jon: AND THEN ONE GUY GOES LET'S [BLEEP] SWIM. (LAUGHTER)
WELL SO, WHAT DO YOU-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS NOW.
I'M DOING DISASTER CON-- CONSULTING AND PUBLIC SPEAKING. (LAUGHTER) AND I'M WRITING THE BOOK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NEW ORLEANS, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. I'M DOING DISASTER CONSULTING, I SELL HAIR CARE PRODUCTS. KATRINA SECRETS IS AVAILABLE NOW. ON AMAZON.COM. RAY NAGIN, EVERYBODY.
