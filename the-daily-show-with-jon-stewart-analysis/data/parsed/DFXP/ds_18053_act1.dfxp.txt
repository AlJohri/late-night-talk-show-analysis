Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW NEW NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"  TONIGHT'S GUEST IS SAY BIG ONE. AL GORE WILL BE JOINING U. HIS  NAME INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AN  ADAGRAM FOR GALORE. THAT'S MEANINGLESS. ON THE MINDS OF EVERYBODY,  ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THEY ARE  AMERICANS. ALL OTHER COUNTRIES ARE LIKE  AMERICA, HOW DO YOU GET YOUR  FOOD SO CHEAP AND LAWN SO MOWED. YOU MUST TELL US YOUR SECRET. [WIS WHISPERING] IT'S ILLEGAL. WE'VE BEEN DIVIDED OVER WHAT TO  DO ABOUT IMMIGRATION. DEMOCRATS PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVE  REFORM WHICH REPUBLICANS HAD A  DIFFERENT NAME FORM.
WHEN HE SAYS COMPREHENSIVE  REFORM HE IS TALKING ABOUT  AMNESTY.
Jon: REPUBLICANS WERE  AGAINST IT AND ACCUSED OTHERS OF  NOT BEING AGAINST ENOUGH.
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST  AMNESTY. YOU ARE OR FOR AMNESTY.
YOU HAD AN OP HE HAD IN THE  NEWSPAPER SAYING YOU WERE FOR  IT.
Jon: YOUR WIFE HAS A  DRESSAGE HORSE NAMED AMNESTY.
YEAH IN THE NEXT DEBATE YOU  WON'T BE ABLE TO NAME THREE  GOVERNMENT AGENCIES YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THEY TALK ABOUT AMNESTY LIKE  IT'S A DEVIANT SEAL PRACTICE.
WHAT I CALL BACKDOOR AMNESTY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WE'VE ALL APPLIED FOR  THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] NO AMNESTY, FINE. WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT  IMMIGRATION?
AS YOUR CONGRESSMAN ON THE  HOUSE FLOOR I'LL DO ANYTHING  SHORT OF SHOOTING THEM.
Jon: ANYONE ELSE? [ LAUGHTER ]
I WILL BUILD A DOUBLE WALLED  FENCE.
20 FEET HIGH. GONNA HAVE BARBED WIRE ON THE  TOP. IT'S GOING TO BE ELECTROCUTED --  ELECTIFIED AND A SIGN ON THE  OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS IT WILL KILL YOU.
Jon: AND THE SIGN WILL BE  IN ENGLISH. [ LAUGHTER ] AH! THAT'S WHY THE EVENTS OF THIS  WEEK CAME AS SUCH A SURPRISE.
A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM LEADING  SENATORS FROM BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES TO AGREE ON A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP.
Jon: WHY THE SUDDEN CHANGE  REPUBLICANS, PERHAPS YOU LOOKED  INTO YOUR HEARTS AND REALIZED PEOPLE WILLING TO RISK WORTH AND  DOING OUR LEAST GLAMOROUS WORK  ARE WORTH AT LEAST A LITTLE  DIGNITY.
LOOK AT THE LAST ELECTION  WE'RE LOSING THE SPIN YAK VOTE.
Jon: OKAY. THAT'S A REASON. NOT SURE THAT'S THE REASON YOU  ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY OUT LOUD BUT  YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY. YOU'VE COME AWAY. THE ARCH OF HISTORY IS LONG BUT  IT BENDS TOWARDS SHAMELESSNESS. WHENEVER EVERYTHING INTENSE  HAPPENS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY  THINGS -- EMOTIONS RUB HIGH. WE'RE JOINED BY AL MADRIGAL. HE IS HERE IN HIS PANIC ROOM.
ACTUALLY JON IT'S ONE WORD:    HISPANIC NOT HIS PANIC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SENATE REPUBLICANS  REPORTING LIVE FROM THE  DEMOGRAPHIC REALITY IN THIS COUNTRY COOPERATING WITH A  BIPARTISAN AND COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL FOR ELECTORAL PURPOSES. YOUR THOUGHTS?
WHAT A MOMENT FOR HISPANICS,  JOHN. TO SEE -- JON. TO SEE REPUBLICANS IN A LAST  DITCH DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO  ENSURE THE EXISTENCE OF THEIR POLITICAL PARTY FINALLY REACH  ACROSS THE AISLE WITH ONE HAND  WHILE USES THE OTHER TO HOLD THEIR NOSES IT'S A GREAT DAY. FORCED AT LAST, FORCED AT LAST,  THANK GOD ALMIGHTY FORCED AT  LAST. WHAT A DAY. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: THAT'S A PRETTY  CYNICAL -- I HAVE TO SAY IT'S  PRETTY CYNICAL POLITICAL  CALCULATIONS.
YEAH, SURE IS.
Jon: I GUESS THE QUESTION  IS:  WILL IT WORK? WILL THIS BRING HISPANICS IN  LARGER NUMBERS TO THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY?
LET'S CRUNCH SOME NUMBERS. LET'S GET DOWN IN THE WEEDS. BY THE WAY, WHO BETTER TO GET  DOWN IN THE WEEDS, RIGHT?
Jon: I GET IT.
MEXICANS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: RIGHT, MEXICANS.
THE WEED (bleep).
Jon: ALL RIGHT, JUST GO.
JEWS ARE CHEAP.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THERE ARE MANY, MANY STEREOTYPES  JUST CONTINUE. HERE WE GO. OBAMA BEAT ROMNEY ABOUT FIVE  MILLION VOTES. THAT'S WITH ROMNEY HAVING WON  27% OF THE LATINO VOTE WHICH  MEANS IF ROMNEY MANAGED 17% MAS THE INAUGURATION WOULD HAVE  LOOKED LIKE THIS.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ANN  ROMNEY'S HAIR?
THOSE BANGS WERE HAPPENING NO  MATTER WHO WON. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DOES THIS IMMIGRATION  BILL MAKE UP FOR PAST SLIGHTS? I MEAN, GAIN THE REPUBLICANS THE  EXTRA 17% THEY NEED? THEY'VE BEEN HARD ON THE  HISPANIC COMMUNITY.
PROBABLY NOT, JON. THE PROBLEM FOR VEABZ THAT WHILE  OVER 90% OF -- REPUBLICANS IS  WHILE OVER 90% OF HISPANICS SUPPORT IMMIGRATION REFORM A  FULL 65% OF LATINOS HOLD  GRUDGES. 83% IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU DID TO  THEIR SISTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: AL, HOW LONG WOULD A  GRUDGE LIKE THAT TYPICALLY LAST? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR HISPANICS  TO GET OVER THE GRUDGE?
A LATINO GRUDGE ON AVERAGE  LASTS JUST OVER FOUR  GENERATIONS. SO RIGHT THERE --
Jon: I GET IT. ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
ITALIAN, IRISH --
Jon: MAKES SENSE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT A  LATINO GENERATION IS ONLY SEVEN  YEARS.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW. THAT TO GET TO 51% OF THE  ELECTRIC TOUR RATE THEY'LL HAVE  TO -- ELECTORATE THEY'LL HAVE TO -- THE REPUBLICANS.
PULL SOME VOTES OF PREVIOUSLY  OFFENDED DEMOGRAPHICS.
Jon: 93% OF  AFRICAN-AMERICANS VOTED FOR  OBAMA. PERHAPS PULL SOME FROM THERE.
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.
I GOT THIS, AL. THAT IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN,  JON, NEVER.
Jon: THERE'S NO WAY THE  REPUBLICANS CAN CHIP AWAY AT THE  AFRICAN VOTE.
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED  LITERALLY JORCHGHTS YES, SIR,  NOTHING IS WRITTEN IN STONE.
THAT'S TRUE. I MEAN MAYBE THE REPUBLICANS  COULD HAVE A CONFERENCE WHERE  THEY TALK ABOUT OUTREACH TO MINORITY VOTERS.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, THAT  COULD HELP.
AND MAYBE THEY COULD HOLD  THAT MINORITY OUT REACH  CONFERENCE, UM, I DON'T KNOW EARLIER THIS MONTH AT A FORMER  VIRGINIA SLAVE PLANTATION! NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
Jon: I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL SHE  GOT IN HERE IT'S CALLED THE  HISPANIC ROOM. NOT YOUNG BLACK CHICK ROOM.
Jon: AL, WHERE ARE  REPUBLICANS GOING TO GET THE  VOTE?
MAYBE ASIANS, I DON'T KNOW  FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE GAY PEOPLE  IF THAT'S EVEN A THING. OR POSSIBLY HAWAIIAN PRANKSTERS  BUT LOOK, IT STILL WON'T GET  THEM OVER THE TOP.
Jon: ROMNEY LOST THE FEMALE  VOTE BY 11 POINTS CSM THEY MAKE  INROADS THERE?
IT'S A POSSIBILITY. I COULD SEE --
AGAIN, I GOT THIS. ROLE 212-
IF IT'S A LEGITIMATE RAPE THE  FEMALE BODY HAS WAYS WAYS TO TRY TO  SHUT THAT WHOLE THING DOWN.
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JESSICA WILLIAM AND
