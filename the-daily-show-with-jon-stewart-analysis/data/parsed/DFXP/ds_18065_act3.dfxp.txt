TONIGHT A JOURNALIST WHO HAS  WRITTEN "BITTER PILL" WHY  MEDICAL BILLS ARE KILLING US. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  STEPHEN BRILL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS -- THANKS FOR COMING ON. THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLE ARTICLE. IT'S CALLED WHY MEDICAL BILLS  ARE KILLING US. I'M ACCUSTOMED TO BEING ANGRY -- [LAUGHTER] -- WHEN I READTIME MAGAZINE. -- READ "TIME" MAGAZINE COVER  STORIES MOSTLY BECAUSE IT'S  LIKE" ARE ANGELS REAL"? BUT THIS IS 36 PAGES OF  INCREDIBLY THOROUG JOURNAL -- I  FORGOT HOW TO PRONOUNCE IT.
COULD YOU CALL IT REPORTING.
Jon: REPORTING.
THERE YOU GO.
Jon: THIS IS THE KIND OF  THING THAT I CANNOT BELIEVE  DURING THIS ENTIRE DEBATE OVER OBAMACARE COMPREHENSIVE  REPORTING OF HEALTH CARE COSTS  WAS NOT OUT THERE.
THAT DROVE ME CRAZY, TOO. I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE FIRST  QUESTION. WE DEBATED THE SECOND QUESTION  WHICH IS WHO SHOULD PAY THE HIGH  BILLS. WE NEVER ASKED THE FIRST  QUESTION WHICH IS WHY ARE THE  BILLS SO HIGH.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. IT FOLLOWS THE MONEY. BILL BY BILL. SEVEN BILLS. TELLS YOU WHO IS MAKING WHAT  MONEY.
Jon: I THINK PEOPLE WOULD  BE SURPRISED THAT NOT FOR PROFIT  HOSPITAL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY AND  THE C.E.O.S OF YOUR LOCAL  HOSPITAL IN ANY TOWN OR CITY IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TYPICALLY THE  BEST PAID C.E.O.S IN TOWN IF  IT'S A SMALL TOWN.
Jon: NOW, WHAT YOU FOUND IS  VERY LITTLE CORRELATION BETWEEN  WHAT THEY CHARGE YOU AND WHAT THINGS COST.
EXACTLY RIGHT.
WHY SHOULD THERE BE? IF YOU BUY SHOES, A RICH GUY  LIKE YOU BUYING A $200 PAIR --
Jon: SURE. LET ME SAY THIS TIMBERLAND'S  DON'T COME CHEAP.
NO, I KNOW. YOU GO TO A STORE AND WANT TO  BUY SHOES.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
INSTEAD OF $200 THE GUY SAYS  THAT IS $6,000. YOU CAN DECIDE NOT TO BUY THE  SHOES. BETTER YET YOU CAN GO UP THE  BLOCK AND SEE IF THEY HAVE A  DIFFERENT PRICE. NONE OF THAT HAPPENS WITH HEALTH  CARE. YOU ARE AN INVOLUNTARY ENTERING  TO THE MARKETPLACE. YOU DON'T WAKE UP AND SAY I WANT  TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND  SEE WHAT IS FOR SALE.
Jon: MAYBE I'LL VISIT A FEW  AND SEE THE BEST PLACE TO GET MY  APRIL DISTRICT MI --  APPENDECTOMY?
RIGHT. THERE'S NO MARKETPLACE IN THE  MOST IMPORTANT SENSE OF THE  DEFINITION DOES THE BUYER HAVE ANY POWER AT ALL. THE BUYER DOESN'T BUY  VOLUNTARILY. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE PRICE  IS AND IF THE BUYER DID HAVE ANY  IDEA HE WOULDN'T HAVE A CHOICE BECAUSE A DOCTOR SENT HIM TO  THAT HOSPITAL OR SAID YOU NEED  THAT BLOOD TEST OR THAT CAT SCAN AND THE RESULT IS PREDICABLE  WHICH IS WHAT YOU HAVE HERE. EVERYBODY IS MAKING A TON OF  MONEY EXCEPT THE DOCTORS AND THE  NURSES. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE  EQUIPMENT WHETHER IT'S CANES OR  CAT SCANS.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE PEOPLE WHO RUN LABS AND  TESTS AND GOD KNOWS THE PEOPLE  WHO RUN THE HOSPITAL THEY ARE MAKING A TON OF MONEY.
WE LIVE IN AN ALTERNATE  UNIVERSE. THERE ARE TWO ECONOMIES IN THIS  COUNTRY. THERE'S THE ECONOMIES OF ALL OF  US AND THE ISLAND, HEALTH CARE  ECONOMY. WE'VE HAD A PRETTY ROUGH TIME  OVER THE LAST FOUR OR FIVES, SIX  YEARS IN OUR ECONOMY. THERE'S A LOT OF UNEMPLOYMENT, A  LOT OF PRESSURE ON US. NOT ON THAT ISLAND. EVERYBODY JUST KEEPS MAKING MORE  MONEY.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S AS IF THEY DON'T EXIST  IN THE UNIVERSE AND WORST OF  ALL, THE MONEY THEY ARE MAKING THEY ARE TAKING FROM ALL OF US  AND BANKRUPTING THE COUNTRY AND  IT'S BANKRUPTING PEOPLE. 60% OF THE PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES  IN THIS COUNTRY COME FROM  MEDICAL BILLS.
Jon: WHAT IS CRAZY TO ME IS  WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TEASE IT  APART. WHEN YOU BEGIN TO DECONSTRUCT  IT, IT'S MADE OF SAND. AS I'M READING IT'S 36 PAGES. AS YOU GET HIGHER AND HIGHER IN  THE PAGES YOU FEEL LIKE CHUCK  YAEGER BREAKING THE SOUND  BARRIER. I WAS LIKE OH, MY GOD. BY PAGE TEN I WAS LIKE I CAN'T  TAKE IT ANYMORE. THERE'S SOMETHING -- YOU CANNOT  BELIEVE THIS. THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE  CHARGE MASTER.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THE CHARGE MASTER  SETS THE PRICE. SO IF YOU WANT AN MRI THAT'S  $6,000 ACCORDING TO THE CHARGE  MASTER. IF YOU GOOD THROUGH MEDICARE  IT'S $500. THE CHARGE MASTER SAYS $6,000.
BUT THE CHARGE MASTER IS --  THE BRIDGEPORT CONNECTICUT  HOSPITAL SAYS $6,000 AND STAMFORD DOWN THE ROAD MAY SAY  $2,000 AND NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN  IT.
Jon: WHEN YOU ASKED ABOUT  CHARGE MASTER THEY SAY WHAT TO  YOU?
PAY NO ATTENTION. MOST PEOPLE DON'T PAY IT. INSURANCE COMPANIES GET A  DISCOUNT. THEY GET A DISCOUNT OFF THE  CHARGE MASTER. IF I SELL YOU A $200, YOU KNOW  SURGEON'S GOWN. YOU PAY FOR A SURGEONS GOWN IN  THE OPERATING ROOM IN ADDITION  TO PAYING FOR THE ROOM. IF I CHARGE YOU $200 AND YOU CAN  GO ON eBAY AND WIE -- BUY IT  FOR $6 THE INSURANCE COMPANY GETS A DISCOUNT DOWN TO $100 NOT  SUCH A GREAT DEAL BUT YOU FEEL  GREAT WHEN YOU GET THE EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS. THAT WAS GREAT I ONLY HAVE TO  20% OF THAT $100. WHAT A DEAL.
Jon: STICK AROUND. THE LATEST ISSUE OF "TIME"  MAGAZINE. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SAID  THIS BEFORE, GO OUT AND GET  "TIME" MAGAZINE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
