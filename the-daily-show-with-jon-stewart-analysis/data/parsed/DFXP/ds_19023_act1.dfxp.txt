ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING MOVE ON TO THE STORY, SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT. THIS IS DIFFICULT.
WHITE REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS CAME UP WITH AN UNORTHODOX STRATEGY TO APPEAL TO A MOSTLY BLACK DEMOCRATIC VOTING DISTRICT HE JUST SIMPLY IMPLIED THAT HE WAS BLACK AS WELL.
Jon: WHITE REPUBLICAN, BLACK VOTING DISTRICT. SAID HE WAS BLACK-- IMPLIED HE WAS BLACK RACIST, NOT RACIST?
I'M GOING TO NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE INFO ON THIS ONE, JON.
LIKE HOW DID HE IMPLY THAT HE WAS BLACK?
Jon: I KNOW, MAYBE HE INDICATED HE -- >>DON'T DON'T --
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.
DON'T I KNOW, DON'T I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY.
OKAY, FINE, YOU PROBABLY DO. ACTUALLY, I THINK WE DO HAVE IF I MAY, WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFO. HERE IS ONE OF THE CANDIDATE DAVE WILSON'S RADIO ADS.

Jon: LET ME JUST SAY THIS, NO, NO, NO. YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT IN A POWER POSITION, I UNDERSTAND THAT. LET'S GET SOME OTHER JUDGES IN HERE. I THINK THAT MIGHT HELP.
SERIOUSLY THAT WOULD HELP ME OUT A LOT.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME KEY AND PEELE. KEY AND PEELE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK WE CAN DO THIS NOW.
JON, THEY'RE NOT IMPARTIAL.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, WE'RE BOTH MIXED RACE.
IT LITERALLY DOESN'T GET ANY MORE IMPARTIAL THAN THAT.
COME ON, YOU ARE BOTH-- YOU'RE BOTH --
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, RACIST, RIGHT THERE, RACIST.
Jon: CAN WE JUST STAY FOCUSED. A COUPLE MORE, A WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST NAMED RICHARD COHEN WHO RECENTLY DEFENDED THE TEA PARTY AGAINST CHARGES OF RACISM BY SUGGESTING THAT THE COUNTRY IS JUST CHANGING FASTER THAN THEY CAN ADAPT. WHICH HE PHRASED THUSLY.
PEOPLE WITH CONVENTIONAL VIEWS MUST REPRESS A GAG REFLEX WHEN CONSIDERING THE MAYOR ELECT OF NEW YORK, A WHITE MAN MARRIED TO A BLACK WOMAN AND WITH TWO BIRACIAL CHILDREN.
Jon: YES.
THAT GUY IS STRAIGHT UP RACIST.
HE'S A VOLCANO OF HATE.
AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
HE'S GIVING WHITE PEOPLE NO CREDIT. BASICALLY HE'S SAYING HEY, YOU GOT TO CUT THE TEA PARTY SOME SLACK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TOO HARD NOT TO VOMIT WHEN THEY SEE A BLACK GUY WITH A WHITE GIRL, RIGHT? OR MAYBE TWO WHITE GIRLS.
YEAH, THREE. (LAUGHTER)
OR LIKE YOU KNOW THREE WHITE GIRLS AND AN ASIAN.
OH YEAH, WHAT IS HE DOING HE'S JUST CHILLIN IT, AT FIRST.
Jon: GUYS, LISTEN, PANEL. WHY IS THE GUY CHILLIN AT FIRST. WHY IS THE ASIAN GUY, HE'S JUST CHECKING THE SCENE OUT. I UNDERSTAND-- HE IS PLOTTING WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO.
WHAT IS HE GOING TO HIT FIRST.
Jon: THAT CAME VERY NATURALLY TO YOU GUYS VERY NICE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL EXAMPLE. SARAH PALIN.
RACIST.
RACIST.
RACIST.
Jon: HOLD ON! HOLD ON! JUST HOLD ON A SECOND! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LET ME SHOW THE CLIP.
YOU FEEL VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT THE OTHER DAY YOU GAVE A SPEECH IN WHICH YOU COMPARED IT TO SLAVERY.
YES, THERE IS ANOTHER DEFINITION OF SLAVERY. AND THAT IS BEING BEHOLDEN TO SOME KIND OF MASTER THAT IS NOT OF YOUR CHOOSING. YES, THE NATIONAL DEBT WILL BE LIKE SLAVERY WHEN THE NOTE COMES DUE. (LAUGHTER)
