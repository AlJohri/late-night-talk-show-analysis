Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT. HIS LATEST FILM IS J.EDGAR.
I KNOW WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER A BRIEF TIME. I'M SURE YOU THINK THAT THE FINEST OF COMPANIONS, YOUR STRENGTH, YOUR CHARACTER, YOUR EDUCATION.
ARE YOU POKING FUN AT ME?
NO, NO, NO, NO. OF COURSE NOT.
THEN PLEASE, MR. HOOVER, STAND UP. CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?
YES, OF COURSE.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN GETTING MARRIED. MY WORK COMES FIRST.
Jon: AND I ALWAYS WEAR THIS HAT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, CLINT EASTWOOD. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.ï¿½i
Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. THERE YOU GO.
THAT WAS A REGULAR NPR WELCOME.
Jon: VERY ENTHUSIASTIC. IT'S JUST INTERESTING. I'VE BEEN HERE 12 YEARS. I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN SUCH A WARM... IT WAS NICE TO SEE THEM CAPABLE OF SUCH LOVE AND GRATITUDE.
THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE. I CAN TELL THAT.
Jon: THEY REALLY ARE. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU MY FAVORITE MOMENT OF THIS MOVIE. NOT GIVING AWAY TREMENDOUS... BUT IT'S A DETAIL THAT I LOVE. HOOVER IS IN BOBBY KENNEDY'S OFFICE, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT  HOW HE GOT A TAPE OF J.F.K. IN A DELICATE SITUATION WITH A WOMAN. BUT HE'S REALLY INTERESTED IN ROBERT KENNEDY'S FIREPLACE. DO YOU REMEMBER THE SCENE?
YEAH.
Jon: LATER ON IN THE MOVIE HE'S INFORMING ROBERT KENNEDY  OF THE ASSASSINATION STANDING IN FRONT OF THE SAME FIREPLACE. BECAUSE HE ADMIRED ROBERT KENNEDY'S FIREPLACE HE ACTUALLY BOUGHT AND BUILT ONE  FOR HIMSELF IN HIS OFFICE.
EXACTLY.
Jon: HOW CRAZY IS THAT GUY?
SOME PEOPLE GET OBSESSED BY LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT. I GUESS HE WAS... HE THOUGHT, WHY SHOULD HE HAVE SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE?
Jon: IT WAS SUCH A NICE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY POINT IT OUT. IT'S AT THIS VERY DRAMATIC MOMENT BUT THE WHOLE TIME I'M  GOING HE'S GOT BOBBY KENNEDY'S FIREPLACE.
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A MISTAKE. WE JUST USED THE WRONG SET.
Jon: I THOUGHT WHY IS HE STANDING IN BOBBY KENNEDY'S OFFICE TELLING HIM ABOUT... AND THEN I REALIZED HE'S PSYCHO.
WELL, HE COULD HAVE BEEN.
Jon: DO YOU THINK SUCH AN INTERESTING PERSONALITY PORTRAYAL, WHAT DO YOU THINK  OF HOOVER AND HIS INTENTIONS? WAS HE, YOU KNOW, OBSESSED WITH LAW AND ORDER BECAUSE HE WAS OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO  CONTROL HIMSELF DO YOU THINK?
I'M NOT SURE. HE IS A MYSTERY GUY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. I GREW UP HEARING HIM ON THE RADIO AND READING ABOUT IT IN THE PAPER BUT VERY LITTLE. IT WAS A NON-INFORMATION AGE. HOOVER WAS ALWAYS THOUGHT OF AS THE HEAD COP, HEAD G-MAN, ALL THAT SORT OF THING. BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY KNEW ABOUT HIM. GREAT RUMORS WOULD COME OUT ABOUT HIM. BUT HE WAS JUST VERY SECRETIVE. I GUESS HE KEPT EVERYTHING BETWEEN HIS SECRETARY HELEN GANDY AND HIS CLOSE PAL....
Jon: CLYDE. HELEN GANDI IS THE WOMAN WE SAW HIM PROPOSING TO IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS WHICH, AS  WE ALL KNOW WHEN IT'S CLOSED IT'S ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC LIBRARIES.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SPOT.
Jon: HE PROPOSES TO HER. SHE TURNS HIM DOWN BUT SHE BASICALLY WORKS WITH HIM HIS WHOLE LIFE.
YES.
Jon: AND CLYDE HAS GOT THESE TWO PEOPLE THAT STAY WITH HIM. IS THAT AS FAR AS HIS INNER CIRCLE WENT?
AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT IS. I MEAN, MAYBE ALONG THE WAY... HE HAD A LOT OF SECOND IN COMMANDS THAT WOULD COME AND GO BUT HE ALSO ALWAYS SEEMED  TO HAVE SOME CONTENTION WITH THEM. HE NEVER IT'S HIS BRAIN TRUST WAS CLYDE AND HELEN.
Jon: AT THE TIME OF HIS LIFE, HOW CONTROVERSIAL WAS CLYDE IN HIS LIFE WORLD? HE WASN'T NECESSARILY QUALIFIED TO BE THE NUMBER TWO OR THEY WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER? WAS THAT WHISPERED ABOUT?
I THINK IT WAS ALWAYS TOGETHER. THEY WERE JUST INSEPARABLE PALS. IN THOSE DAYS, NOBODY MADE TOO MANY INSINUATIONS LIKE NOWADAYS EVERYBODY INSINUATES  THE OBVIOUS OR WHAT THEY WOULD THINK THE OBVIOUS IS.
Jon: RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY WERE UNREQUITED, THAT IT WAS JUST THIS KIND OF TENSION BUT NEVER....
CONSUMMATED?
Jon: THAT IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF PUTTING IT.
I'VE BEEN ON NPR BEFORE. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: TRYING TO BE DELICATE.
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT IMPLICATION. I JUST KIND OF WENT AS A TRUE LOVE STORY, ACTUALLY A LOVE STORY BETWEEN THE THREE PEOPLE. WHERE IT GOES FROM THERE, I DON'T KNOW. PLUS THE FOURTH PERSON BEING HIS MOTHER BECAUSE HE WAS VERY INFLUENCED BY HIS MOTHER. SHE HAD... WE PORTRAYED HER AND WROTE IT IN THE SCRIPT THAT THE MOTHER WAS A VERY DOMINANT PERSON. EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMS TO CORROBORATE THAT.
Jon: A COUPLE OF THOSE SCENES WHERE I THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO GO FULL ON CARRIE. HOOVER IS GOING TO GO TO THE PROM AND THE WALLS ARE GOING TO POOR BLOOD. IT'S INTENSE. BUT IT'S GREAT. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. YOU WOULD HAVE MADE A FINE G- MAN. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT YOU CARRY  YOURSELF WITH A CERTAIN AIR OF LAW AND ORDER.
YOU FEEL VERY SAFE AROUND ME?
Jon: ARE YOU ASKING ME TO MOVE IN WITH YOU? J.EDGAR GOING TO OPEN IN CITIES ON WEDNESDAY. NATIONWIDE ON FRIDAY. CLINT EASTWOOD.
