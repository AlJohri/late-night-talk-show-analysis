Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. I SAID IT BEFORE BUT I'LL SAY IT  TONIGHT AND MEAN IT-- OUR GUEST  TONIGHT IS THE GREAT BASSEM YOUSSEF, FRESH OFF HIS COMMAND  PERFORMANCE AT BOTH THE "TIME  100" DINNER CAN ASK JAIL. IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD. WE BEGIN WAY CELEBRATION OF WHAT  MAKES AMERICA THE HOME OF THE  BRAVE AND THE LAND OF THE AWESOME AND WHY OUR ENEMIES  DON'T GET IT.  ♪ ♪ ♪
THE CONSTITUTION FOUNDED OUR  GREAT COUNTRY. THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION, THE  BLUEPRINTS FOR OUR WAY OF LIFE.
I REALLY WORRY IF WE HAVE  LOST AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR  CONSTITUTION, OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES,AND UNDERSTANDING OF  WHAT MAKES US STRONG.
THEY HATE OUR FREEDOM. THEY HATE OUR WAY OF LIFE. THEY HATE WHO WE ARE. THEY HATE OUR LIBERTY.
Jon:  IT IS LIKE WE ARE  THE ANNE HATHAWAYS OF COUNTRIES? ( LAUGHTER )  YOU HATE US, BUT ONLY BECAUSE  YOU CAN'T GET WITH THIS. ( LAUGHTER )  IT WHY DO YOU HATE AMERICA? IS THAT THAT WE'RE TOO NICE,  THAT WE SING TOO WELL OH, IS  THAT WE'RE TOO HOT? ( LAUGHTER )   ♪ I DREAMED A DREAM--  ♪ ♪  ALL RIGHT  ( LAUGHTER )  AND THAT'S WHY HOW WE HANDLE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING SUSPECT  DZHOKAR TSARNAEV IS SO  IMPORTANT. THE STRENGTH OF OUR SYSTEM LIES  IN HOW DURABLE IT IS, EVEN FOR  OUR MOST HEINOUS CITIZENS.
I'M A LITTLE CONCERN. HE HAS HIS MOORND RIGHTS, THE  RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN  SILENT. FANTASTIC. SO THE BOMBS THAT COULD BE  EXPLODING AND THE PLOTS THAT  COULD BE UNFOLDING, WE CAN'T ASK  HIM.
Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, NOT  READING SOMEONE THEIR MIRANDA  RIGHTS DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR MIRANDA RIGHTS? ( LAUGHTER )  YOU HAVE MIRANDA RIGHTS UNDER  THE CONSTITUTION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THEM OUT  LOUD FOR THEM TO BECOME REAL. ( LAUGHTER ). YOU'RE THINKING BEEBLGHTJUICE. THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVE TO READ  THEM IS SO WHATEVER THE SUSPECT  HAS DONE OR DID, WHATEVER THEY DO SAY IS ADMISSIBLE AT THEIR  TRIAL. IT'S ANOTHER HALLMARK OF OUR  CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED  RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.
I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE NOT TO  TREAT HIM AS AN ENEMY COMBATANT.
WE OUGHT TO TREAT HIM AS AN  ENEMY COMBATANT AND MOVE HIM TO  A MILITARY TRIDIEWNL.
Jon:  IT'S LIKE "GUNS &  ADDRESSES," TED KASZINSKY, AND  RAMSEY YOUSSEF, WENT CITY TO CITY SINGING MED LEES OF  ORIGINAL HITS AND-- WHAT'S THAT? REALLY, DEAD OR IN PRISON, HUH? WHO AM I THINKING OF? OH, THE MUPPETS. OH, ALL RIGHT. I GET IT. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  WELL, TO BE FAIR, THEY BOTH  TRIED TO TAKE MANHATTAN. ( LAUGHTER ). SO IN THE WAKE OF AN ASSAULT ON  OUR FREEDOM AND WAY OF LIFE, WE  HAVE QUICKLY JETTISONED THE SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO A FAIR  TRIAL AND SPEEDY TRIAL AND FIFTH  AMENDMENT'S RIGHT AGAINST  SELF-INCRIMINATION. WHAT'S NEXT.
THIS GUY OUGHT TO BE  INTERROGATED IN A VERY INTENSE  WAY.
I'D WATERBOARD HIM.
I DON'T BELIEVE ENHANCED  INTERROGATION IS TORTURE.
I DOWNTOWN BELIEVE ENHANCED  INTERROGATION IS TORTURE BECAUSE  TORTURE LIKE TINKER BELLS IS BASED ON WHO WE BELIEVE. ANY FREEDOM LOVERS WANT TO TAKE  A CRACK AT SOME OF THE LOWER  ONES, YOUR THIRD, YOUR FOURTH.
SHOULD THE F.B.I. BE ALLOWED  TO GO TO MOSQUES AND WIRETAP AND  SURVEILL.
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT CASE  FOR OPENING UP THAT LINE OF--
I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO  PUT IN LISTENING DEVICES IN  THERE.
Jon:  SURE, ILLEGAL  SEARCH AND SEIZURE? DONE! THE FREEDOM LOVERS AT FAX ARE  JETTISONING AMENDMENTS LIKE HAN  SOLO DUMPING CARGO TO MAKE THE IMPERIAL CRUISER. YOU KNOW WHAT? ANYBODY CAN TOSS AWAY THE LESSER  KNOWN AMENDMENTS. ONLY A TRUE PATRIOT CAN SAY THE  COURSE STRAIGHT FOR THE FIRST.
I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO  CONSIDER GIVEN WANT FACT SO MANY  PEOPLE HATE US THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT OFF MUSLIM  STUDENTS TO COMING TO THIS  COUNTRY FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME.
Jon:  YES! A RELIGIOUS LITMUS TEST FOR  SCHOOL ENROLLMENT, SAYS FOX'S  MOST PROMINENT LIBERAL VOICE. ( LAUGHTER ). HOLY ( BLEEP )! WHAT'S LEFT? A PROHIBITION ON THE UNMENTIONED  PERSONAL RIGHTS IN THE  CONSTITUTION THAT ARE DESIGNATE TO THE PEOPLE?
I WANT TON ABOUT THIS-- THIS  WIFE AS WELL.
DON'T CARE IF SHE QUE ABOUT  THIS. SHE OUGHT TO BE IN PRISON FOR  WEARING A HIJAB.
Jon:  DOWN GOES THE NINTH  AMENDMENT! DOWN GOES THE NINTH AMENDMENT! ANN COULTER DOESN'T JUST WANT A  POLICE STATE. SHE WANTS A FASHION POLICE  STATE. NOW, OF COURSE --  ( APPLAUSE )  TO THEIR CREDIT, ANY OF THE FOX  CONTRIBUTORS OR ANCHORS WHO HAVE STUDIED LAW HAVE A SOME  DIFFERENT TAKE ON THIS SUBJECT.
TO TRY HIM AS AN ENEMY  COMBATANT, THE GOVERNMENT  CAN'T-- CAN'T JUST WILL WILLY-NILLY DO THAT.
NOW YOU'RE GETTING INTO A  DANGEROUS PLACE.
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
NO. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  BUT, OF COURSE,  THESE TYPES OF LEGAL ARGUMENTS  ARE NO MATCH FOR FREEDOM MATH.
HOW MANY MUSLIMS UNTIL THE  WORLD.
1.57 WELL. LET'S SAY 10% DISLIKE OR HATE  US. THAT MEANS 157 MILLION MUSLIMS  HATE US. IF 10%, 5%, 1% ARE RADICALIZEDIZED  AND WOULD KILL US.
THAT'S--
THAT'S 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE WHO  ARE RADICALIZED TO THE POINT  WHERE THEY WOULD WANT TO KILL YOU-- KILL US AMERICANS.
Jon:  WOW, THAT'S--  ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S INTERESTING. CAN I SEE A FOOTNOTE CITATION  FOR THOSE FIGURES? OH, THAT'S WHERE HE GOT THEM. I WASN'T SURE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HEY, I GOT AN IDEA. SINCE WE'RE JUST THROWING  MAEMENTZ AWAY WILLY-NILLY WHAT,  IF WE WANTED TO, I DON'T KNOW, TRACK THE WEAPONS ANY OF THESE  AMERICA HATERS BOUGHT OR DO A  BACKGROUND CHECK IF ANY TRY TO PURCHASE WEAPON HERE'S IN  AMERICA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS IS PROTECT  MED IN THE CONSTITUTION.
THERE'S NO AMBIGUITY HERE. THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO KEEP  AND BEAR ARMS SHALL NOT BE  INFRINGED.
Jon:  NO AMBIGUITY THERE. IN THE LAST FEW DECADES THERE  HAVE BEEN 3400 DEATH FRGZ  TERRORISM, ISLAMIC AND OTHERWISE AND WE HAVE HAD, I DON'T, A  MILLION DEATH FROM GUN VIOLENCE. IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO  ABOUT THAT.
JOE BIDEN SAID THE PRESIDENT  MAY CRACK DOWN ON GUNS BY  EXECUTIVE ORDER.
TAKING OUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS  AWAY.
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S ONLY ONE  AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION'S  PANTON THAT IS EXEMPT FROM STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OR  EMOTIONAL SEEK-OUT-ITUDE. AND IT IS THE SECOND. GOD HELP US IF THE MUSLIMS EVER  DECIDE TO FORM A WELL-REGULATED  MILITIA. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ). WE'LL HAVE NO WAY TO STOP THEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
