A PARTY, A CANDIDATE TOO SUCCESSFUL FOR TEXAS. A CITY TOO HUMID TO BREATHE. FROM TAMPA FLORIDA, THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION, THE ROAD TO JEB BUSH, 2016.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM THE STRAZ CENTER OF THE PERFORMING ARTS IN FAMILIAR BA FLORIDA. MY NAME IS JON STEWART, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM I AM NOT GOING TO WASTE ANY OF YOUR TIME. WE WILL GET DOWN TO COVERAGE OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AND START WITH OLIVER  IN THE GRANT PARK AREA OF TAMPA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JON, TROPICAL STORM ISAAC HAS PASSED, RETURNING THIS CITY BACK TO ITS NORMAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS.
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FRIARS CLUB STEAM ROOM AND A SUBWAY PLATFORM IN HAITI.
IT IS.
Jon: IT IS A BIT MUGGY.
A BIT MUGGY, JON?  THE AMAZON IS A BIT MUGGY. THIS IS THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT.
Jon: YES.
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION IN TAMPA, FLORIDA AT THE END OF AUGUST. THERE IS NO PLACE THAT YOU WOULD RATHER BE. PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE AN INSECT FROM AN INDIANA JONES FILM OR A STRUGGLING STRAND OF STREPTOCOCCUS.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS WOULD CHOOSE TO HAVE THEIR CONVENTION HERE IN TAMPA  AT THE END OF AUGUST?
THAT IS EASY, BECAUSE TAMPA IS A PERFECT SYMBOL OF WHAT OBAMA HAS DONE TO AMERICA. IN JUST THREE AND A HALF YEARS, THIS ONCE BUSTLING METROPOLIS IS NOW A WIND AND RAIN SOAKED FORECLOSED SHELL OF ITSELF. ITS DENIZENS BARRICADING THEMSELVES IN THEIR HOME, THE DESPERATELY TRYING TO PROTECT  WHATEVER RAT-URINE-SOAKED METH EQUIPMENT THEY STILL OWN.
Jon: NOW, JOHN, THAT IS A BIT HYPERBOLIC, NOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO LIVES IN TAMPA  MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES METHAMPHETAMINE.
OBVIOUSLY NOT, JON. SOME OF THEM HAVE TO BUY IT. IT'S NOT A PONZI SCHEME.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT TO JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA HAS BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON THE STORM TRACK FOR HURRICANE ISAAC SCHEDULED TO MAKE LANDFALL  IN NEW ORLEANS. JESSICA.
BARACK OBAMA DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT?  I'M SORRY. SAY THAT AGAIN.
I'M SORRY. I KNOW, I WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE WEATHER BUT, JON, THIS IS OBAMA'S AMERICA. STORM, DROUGHT, AND ALL BECAUSE HE HAS DONE NOTHING TO STEM THIS EXPLOSION OF GAY MARRIAGE.
Jon: OH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY CLIMATE CHANGE.
WHAT NOW?  JON, I AM GLAD THE REPUBLICANS ARE HERE IN FAMILIAR  PARKS IT HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT NO HURRICANE WOULD HAVE DARED TO BARREL DOWN ON NEW  ORLEANS UNDER REPUBLICAN'S WATCH.
Jon: WANT KATRINA.
BUSH INHERITED THAT FROM CLINTON.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, JESSICA. LET'S GO OUT TO JASON JONES. JASON JONES. YES, JASON. JASON.
YES.
JON, I AM HERE IN TAMPA'S FAMOUS STRIP CLUB DRINK. OR AS THEY CALL IT HERE, TAMPA. AND THANKS TO THE ANYTHING GOES LIBERALISM OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THIS WHOLE TOWN  HAS BECOME A THROBBING DEN OF MORAL DEPRAVITY. UGH. WHERE ONCE CHURCHES AND MOM AND POP PIE STORES, NOW YOU HAVE GOT A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF STORE. SHRINKING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PIE.
JUST LOOK AT THESE BARE ASSETS, BOTTOMS UP, FOXY'S, MONLS VENUS, TEASERS, MISS BEHAVIN', THE VAGINA FARM, LADY --
Jon: THERE ARE A LOT OF STRIP CLUBS BUT YOU THINK THAT IS ALL OBAMA'S FAULT?
OH, OH, BLAME IT ON BUSH.
Jon: NO, I AM NOT BLAMING IT ON BUSH. I AM JUST SAYING --
SORRY, SORRY, JON, BLAME IT ON BUSH IS JUST ANOTHER STRIP CLUB.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
JON AS YOU KNOW IT IS ALL OBAMA'S FAULT.
Jon: SO EVERYTHING IN TAMPA, THE WEATHER, THE STRIP CLUB, ECONOMIC HARD SHIM.
YES, YES. THE FAKE PIRATE MARDI GRAS, ALL OBAMA'S FAULT.
Jon: I FIND THIS VERY HARD TO BELIEVE. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.
PERHAPS THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND.
Jon: SAMANTHA --
IN MIDAIR, JON.
Jon: OH, MY GOD!  HOECALLY CLAP, WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, JON, I WAS COMING OUT OF A WAFFLE HOUSE, APPARENTLY THE SCENT OF STIRRUP AND  CIGARETTE ASH PROVED IRRESISTIBLE TO THIS, THE LOCALS HAVE ASSURED ME IS A JUVENILE PALMETTO BUG.
THAT IS NOT AN ADULT PALMETTO BUG?
NO, NO, BUT IT WILL BE SOON. THERE IS A CERTAIN SOCIALIST TREE HUGGER PRESIDENT THAT BANNED DDT.
Jon: I TELL YOU, I THINK NIXON BANNED DDT.
WELL, IT WAS SOME DEMOCRAT, I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: WELL, GOOD LUCK, SAMANTHA.
DON'T WISH ME LUCK, I AM THE ONE GETTING FLOWN OUT OF THIS S *IT HOLE. WAIT, HE'S TAKING ME TO ST. PETE'S!. NO!
Jon: THANKS GUYS, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN WITH EVERYBODY LATER. SO TONIGHT -- SORRY. IT WAS -- ONE OF THOSE THINGS WASN'T REAL AND I AM PRETTY SURE  IT WAS WHAT WAS IN JASON'S LAP, I THINK.
TONIGHT, AS WE SPEAK, CHRIS CHRISTIE IS DELIVERING THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.  THE THEME OF THE NIGHT, WE DID BUILD THAT, A SALUTE TO THE UNION  WORKERS WHO GUILT STATE FUNDED TAMPA BAY CONVENTION CENTER FORUM AND THE UNDOCUMENTED  WORKERS WHO -- I'M SORRY, WHAT IS THAT?  OKAY. IT SAYS PERSONAL INITIATIVE AND SELF RELIANCE.
Jon: I AM SURE IT WAS A GREAT STREET. LAST NIGHT FESTIVITIES WERE CANCELED BECAUSE OF HURRICANE ISAAC. TONIGHT THEY CELEBRATE BAR MITZVAH AND IT IS IN THE EYES OF GOD A HURRICANE. POSITIVE EL OF THE.
IMAGINE THAT, A JEWISH JOKE IN TAMPA GOING DOWN WELL. THAT IS STUNNING. A STUNNING DEVELOPMENT. .. OBVIOUSLY A TERRIBLE STORM HEADING TOWARDS NEW ORLEANS ON THE SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF  KATRINA, ALL OF US OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE TRUE VICTIMS OF THE STORM.
HE HAS A COMPETING STORY WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DON'T WANT.
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON HOW THIS HAS HURT THE REPUBLICANS.
I THINK IT HAS HURT THE DEMOCRATS.
IT IS TOUGH FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO BE CELEBRATING THE NOMINEE IF THERE IS  DEVASTATION ALONG THE COASTLINE.
WE NEED -- THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR WHAT MITT  ROMNEY IS PROPOSING.
REPORTERS ARE VERY QUICK TO WANT TO DO A DOUBLE BOX WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NEW  ORLEANS, ALONG WITH THE CONVENTION.
YOU ARE DOING IT RIGHT NOW WITH THE BOX.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I KNOW.
Jon: I KNOW. I KNOW. I HATE MY LIFE. YES, THAT HURRICANE MAP ON THAT SCREEN IS SO DISTRACTING. HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR (BLEEP) SCREENS ON CNBC?
THERE, IT LOOKS LIKE A PYLON JACKSON OF -- YOU HAVE ALL OF A  SUDDEN IT FLIPS DOWN VERTICALLY AND BOOM, JUST WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?  I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU CNBC, YOU ALREADY PIMPED YOUR RIDE. PUTTING THAT IN THE HURRICANE IS NOT GOING TO (BLEEP).
WHO WATCHES CNBC?  FLIES?  WHO CAN PICK ALL THAT STUFF UP ON THE SCREEN?
WOULD IT BE THE WORST THING FOR THE REPUBLICANS IF THE NEWS PEOPLE ALSO KEPT WATCHERS  APPRISE APPRISED OF A HURRICANE IN NEW ORLEANS ALONG WITH THE EXCHANGE RATES IN TUNISIA.
THE WORST THINGS FOR A REPUBLICAN IS THE SPLIT SCREEN OF PARTISAN SPEECHES AS PEOPLE  ARE BEING EVACUATED.
Jon: REALLY?  NOT ONLY DO I NOT THINK THAT WOULD BE WITH THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD FOR  REPUBLICANS, I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE WORST HUMAN EVACUATION BASED SPLIT SCREEN FOR REPUBLICANS.
THIS CONVENTION WILL COME TO ORDER.
