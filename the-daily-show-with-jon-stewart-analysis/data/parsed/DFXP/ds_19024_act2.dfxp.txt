Jon: WELCOME BACK. SCIENCE, SCIENCE, SCIENCE. WE'VE ALL SLEPT THROUGH IT. BUT DID YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKE IT? SUCH AS NOTED ASTROPHYSICIST NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON WHO USES SCIENCE TO CORRECT SOME OF HUMANITIES GREATEST MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
THE FILM "GRAVITY" IS OFF TO AN ASTRONOMICAL START.
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON DIRECTOR OF NEW YORK'S HAYDEN PLANETARIUM CRITICIZED THE MOVIE AS SCIENTIFICALLY INACCURATE.
TYSON TWEETED MYSTERIES OF GRAVITY, WHY BULLOCK'S HAIR DID NOT FLOAT FREELY ON HER HEAD.
THE BEGINNING OF YOUR PROGRAM, YOUR EARTH IS SPINNING THE WRONG DIRECTION.
SON OF A BITCH! I MAY HAVE OVERREACTED TO THAT ONE. HE IS ON TO SOMETHING HERE WE'LL SOON FIND OUT IN OUR BRAND-NEW SEGMENT NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, BUZZKILL OF SCIENCE. (APPLAUSE) WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT (APPLAUSE) WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US FOR THIS BRAND-NEW SEGMENT.
THANK YOU, JON, GOOD TO BE BACK.
Jon: TONIGHT ON NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON BUZZKILL OF SCIENCE, ZOMBIES! WALKING DEAD IS A RUNAWAY TELEVISION HIT, THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IS CLEARLY ON EVERYONE'S MIND. ZOMBIES, COULD IT HAPPEN, LET THE DEBUNKING BEGIN.
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I DO. WHAT I DO, INSTEAD, IS CORRECT ERRORS IN OTHERWISE SEEMINGLY ACCURATE PORTRAYALS OF SCIENCE. ZOMBIES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A FANTASY THAT WILLFULLY IGNORES LAWS OF PHYSICS AND PHYSIOLOGY LIKE BACKYARDS TIME TRAVEL OR LOVE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING THE WALKING DEAD, THESE ZOMBIE MOVIES YOU'RE NOT MENTALLY CATALOGING ALL THE THINGS SCIENTIFICALLY THAT THEY ARE GETTING WRONG.
FIRST, JON, I DON'T REALLY WATCH TELEVISION.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
WHAT I DO, THIS IS WHAT I DO-- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH EXCITEMENT THERE IS IN A SINGLE DROP OF WATER? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NO.
IT'S A UNIVERSE OF MICROBES.
Jon: OKAY. HEY, SO IS IT TRUE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO KILL A ZOMBIE IS TO SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD?
JON, PLEASE, YOU CANNOT KILL SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY DEAD. WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM DISTRIBUTING OXYGENATED BLOOD, A ZOMBIE'S MUSCLES WOULD SUCCOMB TO RIGOR MORTIS. THEY COULDN'T EVEN STAND LET ALONE WALK. THEY HAVE NO DESIRE TO EAT BRAINS BECAUSE THE FATTY TISSUE WOULD HAVE STOPPED PRODUCING THE HORMONE LEPTIN WHICH TRIGGERS THE SENSATION OF HUNGER IN THE FIRST PLACE. JUST SAYING. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO IF I GET BIT BY A ZOMBIE DO I TURN INTO A ZOMBIE.
OF COURSE NOT. ZOMBIEISM CAN'T SPREAD THROUGH MASTICATION.
Jon: THAT IS HOW THEY SPREAD IT? I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY HAD TO BITE YOU.
NO, BEING CHEWED ON BY A ZOMBIE.
Jon: GOOD, BECAUSE THEY SPREAD IT THE OTHER WAY, I MEAN-- WE REALLY WOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE RIGHT NOW. AND QUITE FRANKLY, I WOULD BE THE LEADER.
ZOMBIES ARE A GOOD ANALOGY FOR VIRAL OUTBREAKS BUT WHEN SOMETHING BITES YOU, YOU DON'T TURN INTO THAT THING. AND EVEN IF THAT WAS REMOTABLY POSSIBLE, THEN EVANDER HOLYFIELD WOULD HAVE TURNED INTO MIKE TYSON YEARS AGO.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING NO WAY, NO WAY ZOMBIES EXIST.
JON, LET'S NOT GO THAT FAR, OKAY. I'M A SCIENTIST. I HAVE TO BE OPEN TO EVERY POSSIBILITY. WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HUMAN EARTHLING ZOMBIES BUT I CAN'T SAY SOMEWHERE IN THE INFINITE REACHES OF THE COSMOS THERE ISN'T A HEAVENLY PLANET THAT EVOLVED A LIFE FORM CAPABLE OF REANIMATING AND FEEDING UPON THE ORGANS OF THE LIVING.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP] I KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.
SPACE ZOMBIES.
Jon: SPACE ZOMBIES, I KNEW IT! YOU ARE AFRAID OF SPACE ZOMBIES.
NO, NO, NO, NOT AT ALL. I'M AFRAID OF REAL THINGS.
Jon: REAL THINGS? LIKE-- LIKE HOW TRILLIONS OF YEARS FROM NOW THE IRREVERSIBLE INCREASE IN ENTROPY AND OUR ASYMPTOTIC DESCENT ABSOLUTE ZERO WILL LEAVE THE UNIVERSE AS NOTHING MORE THAN A COLD, INERT WASTE LAND, DEVOID OF LIFE, MOVEMENT, AND EVEN THE VERY CONCEPT OF ENERGY.
Jon: YOU'RE FREAKING EVERYBODY OUT. YOU KNOW I CAN JUST TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON, BRING THEM BACK UP. BRING THEM BACK UP, SO YOU HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT BUT NOT MAKE THE GLOBE IN YOUR OPENING CREDITS TURN THE RIGHT WAY? MOTHER [BLEEP] TYSON!
