FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY EVERYBODY. WELCOME. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT'S GUEST, SONIA NAZARIO, AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, "ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY," IT'S ABOUT A YOUNG HONDURAN BOY'S ATTEMPT TO COME TO AMERICA AND FIND HIS MOTHER, AND NOT AS THE TITLE MIGHT LEAD DO YOU BELIEVE, AN INSPIRING TALE OF ENRIQUE IGLESIAS'S BATTLE TO ACCEPT THE MOLE THAT WAS ON HIS FACE AND OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ENDING, BUT HE HAS IT REMOVED. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST, OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NEW YORK CITY HAS DONE AN AWFUL LOT TO CLEAN UP TIMES SQUARE. YOU BEEN DOWN TO TIMES SQUARE? IT IS NOT THE ROMANTIC JUNKIE HAUNTED, CRACK INFESTED, BEHOOKERED PLAYGROUND WE ALL LOVE. GONE ARE THE DAYS YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT SOME MASKED STRANGER DEMANDING THAT YOU HAND OVER ALL YOUR MONEY. WELL, ALMOST.
25-YEAR-OLD JUNIOR BISHOP DRESSED AS SPIDER-MAN TOOK A PHOTO WITH TWO PEOPLE. AND WHEN THE COUPLE ATTEMPTED TO GIVE THE MAN $1, BISHOP SAID HE ONLY TAKES $5, $10 AND $20s. A POLICE OFFICER OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION AND STEPPED IN, TELLING THE COUPLE THEY CAN DONATE WHATEVER THEY WANT. THE OFFICER ASKED FOR BISHOP'S I.D. BUT HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE AN I.D.
Jon: [WHISPERING]: HIS REAL NAME'S PETER PARKER, P-A-R-K-ER. HE LIVES WITH HIS AUNT IN QUEENS. [LAUGHTER] AND IT'S HIS FAULT UNCLE BEN DIED. [AUDIENCE REACTS] IT WAS HIS FAULT! SPIDER-MAN'S EGOTISM CAUSED THAT. HE WASN'T SPIDER-MAN AT THE TIME. HE WAS PETER PARKER AND HE DIDN'T REALIZE WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY, BUT AT THE TIME HE DIDN'T HAVE GREAT POWER BUT HE [BLEEP] UNCLE BEN. NOBODY CAN TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS LITTLE THING HERE IS NOT GOING TO END WELL.
THE OFFICER TOLD BISHOP HE WAS GOING TO PLACE HIM UNDER ARREST. AND THAT'S WHEN POLICE SAY BISHOP PUNCHED THE OFFICER IN THE FACE. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: WITH GREAT POWER COMES LACK OF IMPULSE CONTROL. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION EVERYBODY HAS IN THIS SITUATION IS: DID BATMAN THINK THAT THE POLICE WERE JUSTIFIED?
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STATEN ISLAND. SOMEBODY GET CHOKED JUST LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? HE COULD GET CHOKED FOR THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BRUCE! BRUCE! WE CAN SEE YOUR FACE, BRUCE. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THE INCIDENT BATMAN IS REFERENCING WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE POLICE GOT OUT OF CONTROL IN STATEN ISLAND. IT WAS A TRAGIC CASE OF ERIC GARNER.
ERIC GARNER IS THE STATEN ISLAND MAN WHO DIED IN POLICE CUSTODY AFTER AN ALLEGED CHOKEHOLD.
MR. GARNER WAS ALLEGEDLY SELLING WHAT'S CALLED IN NEW YORK CITY LOOSIES, CIGARETTES, UNTAXED CIGARETTES AT 75 CENTS APIECE.
Jon: SURE, THAT'S HOW IT STARTS. BUT THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THAT GUY'S SELLING GUM ONE STICK AT A TIME AND PRINGLES BY THE CHIP. [LAUGHTER] PRINGLES SINGLES OR SPRINGLES, AS THEY'RE KNOWN ON THE STREET. WELL, WE CAN AT LEAST HOPE ERIC GARNER'S SENSELESS DEATH MARKS THE END OF EXCESSIVE FORCE BY POLICE.
THE NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS UP TO 1,000 REPORTS OF SUSPECTS BEING PLACED IN ILLEGAL CHOKEHOLDS MAY NOW HAVE TO BE REVIEWED.
NYPD OFFICIALS SAY THE ENTIRE FORCE MAY HAVE TO BE RETRAINED.
Jon: OKAY, RETRAINING LESSON NUMBER ONE: THIS IS A CAMERA PHONE. WHEN THAT IS POINTED AT YOU, OFFICER, STOP STRANGLING THE PERSON. [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE, WE TURN TO SENIOR... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OH, OKAY. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT, I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RACIAL ISSUES. I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE SENIOR POLICE MISCONDUCT CORRESPONDENT OR...
[LAUGHING] JON, YOU'RE SO FUNNY ACTING LIKE THEY'RE NOT RELATED.
Jon: [LAUGHING]
NOT FUNNY, JON.
Jon: RIGHT.
THIS [BLEEPED] HAS GOT TO STOP ALREADY.
Jon: YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY, BUT BLACK PEOPLE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO SOMETIMES GET MISTREATED BY THE POLICE. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE VIDEOS OF THESE WHITE KIDS THERE IN THE PROTEST THERE GETTING SPRAYED.
OH PLEASE, JON, C'MON THAT'S PEPPER SPRAY. THEY'RE JUST GETTING SEASONED. [LAUGHTER] AND BESIDES, I DON'T EVEN COUNT THEM AS WHITE PEOPLE. THEY'RE HIPPIES. IT'S NOT THE SAME.
Jon: ALRIGHT. UM... FAIR POINT. BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT THE POLICE AREN'T AS QUICK TO CHOKE OUT A WHITE PERSON AS A BLACK PERSON?
WELL, LET'S COMPARE. I MEAN, ERIC GARNER WAS UNARMED, HOLDING HIS HANDS UP, AND POLITELY ASKING THE COPS TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
Jon: RIGHT.
LOOK, HERE'S A WHITE GUY IN MICHIGAN LAST MONTH, LOOK, THERE HE IS THREATENING THE COPS WITH A RIFLE, AND LOOK. NOW HE'S... JON, HE'S WAVING HIS [BLEEPED] AT THEM. OH [BLEEPED]. THEY'RE GOING TO [BLEEPED] HIM UP BAD. WHAT? THEY'RE GOING TO SIT AND HAVE A CHAT? YOU GOT TO BE [BLEEPED] KIDDING ME. I MEAN... [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELL, I, ALL RIGHT.
NO, I MEAN, HE WAS ASKING FOR A CHOKEHOLD.
Jon: AT THE LEAST.
NO, SERIOUSLY, HE WAS ASKING FOR A CHOKEHOLD, AND THEY STILL DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM. I MEAN, THIS GUY COULD HAVE SHOT HIS WAY OUT OF FALLUJAH. THE ONLY THING ERIC GARNER WAS BRANDISHING WAS HIS BLACK.
Jon: TO BE FAIR IT IS DANGEROUS OUT THERE FOR COPS, TODAY IN THE WEST VILLAGE, THREE OFFICERS SHOT CHASING DOWN THIS PEDOPHILE GUY. THE NYPD HAS MADE HUGE RODES IN DIVERSITY. THERE'S A LOT OF BLACK COPS NOW.
JON, HEY, HEY BLACK COPS CAN BEAT UP BLACK PEOPLE, TOO. LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD, BLACK COPS, JUST THAT YOU DO, OK. SO, THIS ISN'T A WHITE/BLACK ISSUE. THIS IS A COP/BLACK ISSUE.
Jon: REALLY? SO DO YOU THINK, WHAT IS IT, SOMETHING ABOUT THE UNIFORM?
I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE, JON. I MEAN, I ONCE DRESSED AS A COP FOR HALLOWEEN. BY THE END OF THE NIGHT, I WAS CHOKING BROTHERS. SO YEAH, I UNDERSTAND, IT'S DIFFICULT.
Jon: MAYBE, MAYBE CHANGE THE COSTUME TO CAPTAIN AMERICA. THIS IN AN ADVANCE. THIS YEAR, YOU KNOW, MARVEL ANNOUNCED CAPTAIN AMERICA IS NOW GOING TO BE BLACK. THAT'S AN ADVANCE. THAT'S...
VERY NICE MARVEL. VERY NICE. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: YES...THAT SEEMS SOMEWHAT SARCASTIC. GOLF CLAPPISH.
I KNOW. SO THEY REALLY THINK A BLACK SUPERHERO IS GOING TO CHANGE THINGS? JON, YOU KNOW HE'S JUST GOING TO SPEND ALL HIS TIME ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY YOU ALWAYS SEEMS TO SHOW UP AT CRIME SCENES? NOT TO MENTION THE OUTFIT IS RED AND BLUE, HUH? SO YOU'RE WITH THE BLOODS AND THE CRIPS.
Jon:, YEAH, IT WOULD BE LIKE, IT'D BE LIKE, HEY, HOW DID YOU AFFORD THAT SHIELD? WHAT, DID YOU STEAL IT, HUBCAPTAIN AMERICA? YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE STEAL...
WOAH, WOAH, WOAH, HEY,  JON, STEAL IT, COME ON.
Jon: BUT I THOUGHT WE WERE DOING A BIT ABOUT THE...
I'M JUST [BLEEPED] WITH YOU, JON. I MEAN, AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, COME ON, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT?
LARRY WILMORE, EVERYONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
