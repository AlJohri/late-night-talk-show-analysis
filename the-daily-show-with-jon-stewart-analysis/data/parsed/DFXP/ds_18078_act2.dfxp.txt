WELCOME BACK. GUN VIOLENCE, WHO ARE ITS REAL  VICTIMS? YOU MIGHT THINK THE BULLET  RECIPIENT. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD THINK AGAIN. JOHN OLIVER HAS MORE.
Reporter: ARIZONA HAS  SUFFERED GREATLY DUE TO GUN  VIOLENCE IN RECENT YEARS. ACTIVIST CHARLES HELLER HAS HAD  ENOUGH. SO HE'S STANDING UP FOR THE REAL  VICTIMS.
GUNS. Reporter: WHAT? THE CITY ACTUALLY PAYS THE  COMPANY TO DESTROY GUNS, FULLY  AUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS, SHORT-BARRELED RIFLES,  SHORT-BARELIED SHOTGUNS
Reporter: YOU SEE, GUN  TERMINATION HAPPEN RIGHT IN  HELLER'S BACKYARD WHEN TWO TOWN COUNCILMEN ORGANIZED A GUN  BUY-BACK PROGRAM TO TAKE OLD  EXISTING GUNS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY FOR DESTRUCTION. AND WHEN HELLER WITNESSED THE  GUN CARNAGE, IT WAS JUST TOO  HARD BREAKING.
WHAT A WASTE. Reporter: WHAT A WASTE. MMMM.
THAT ONE MAKES ME THINK ABOUT  WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WARSAW  GHETTO IN 1943
Reporter: IT DOES  SHADES OF WHAT HELPED LEAD TO  THE HOLOCAUST.
Reporter: VERY DEFINITELY NOT  OVERSTATING IT.
NOPE. IT'S NOT.
Reporter: NOPE. I COULDN'T BEAR WITNESS TO THIS  HORROR ANY LONGER. SO I WENT TO CONFRONT GUN HITLER  HIMSELF, STEVE
WE GAVE PEOPLE A LEGITIMATE  OPPORTUNITY TO GET GUNS OUT OF  THEIR HOMES THAT THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT THERE ANYMORE
Reporter: GIVE ME YOUR GUNS. THAT IS AN ORDER. SO I CAN MELT THEM DOWN
RIGHT. IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS I'VE  BEEN CALLED A SECOND AMENDMENT  BIGOT, A NAZI AND HITLER.
Reporter: A COMMUNIST. AN UNAMERICAN PIECE OF SCUM.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. I'M GOING TO SPEAK FOR WHAT THIS  COMMUNITY STANDS FOR AND HAS  STOOD FOREVER SINCE WE WENT THROUGH THE TRAGIC SHOOTING TWO  YEARS AGO. YOU'RE MARGINALIZING YOURSELF  FROM A RATIONAL CONVERSATION
Reporter: IF THE JACK BOOT  FITS, WEAR IT, STEVE. BUT HELLER AND HIS ALLIES  WEREN'T GOING TO GET COMMANDANT  GET AWAY WITH IT. SO THEY RACED DOWN TO THE  BUY-BACK OFFERING TO PURCHASE  THESE FIREARMS AND MAKE SURE THEY LIVED TO SHOOT ANOTHER DAY.
GUN OWNERS STOOD BY WITH  THEIR OWN COUNTEROFFERS
GUN ADVOCACY GROUP OFFERED  MORE MONEY FOR THE SAME WEAPONS
Reporter: FOR THESE GUN  HEROES EVERY GUN LIFE IS IS  SACRED. HOW MANY GUNS DID THEY MANAGE TO  SAVE THAT DAY?
THEY GOT 83 GUNS. Reporter: THEY SAVED 83 GUNS  FROM DESTRUCTION
THAT THEY DID. Reporter: THEY WERE LIKE  FIREARMS SCHINDLERS
IT WAS JUST A GOOD DAY  Reporter: SADLY, ONE GUN  OWNER MADE A CHOICE HE MAY END UP REGRETTING FOREVER. A STUPID, THOUGHTLESS CHOICE. YOU WERE AT A POINT HAD YOUR  LIFE WHERE YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE  YOU COULD GIVE THAT GUN A GOOD HOME SO YOU JUST TERMINATED
I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY  Reporter: I DID PUT IT THAT  WAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT  HAPPENED.
I WANTED TO TURN IT IN TO BE  DESTROYED
Reporter: YOU SLEEP WELL  THANK YOU  Reporter: THAT'S NOT A  COMPLIMENT. I'M SAYING LIKE YOU WON'T SLEEP  WELL. AT LEAST HELLER IS OFFERING A  BETTER CHOICE. THE CHOICE TO SELL YOUR GUN TO A  STRANGER ON THE STREET. WHERE ARE ALL THOSE GUNS NOW?
PROBABLY IN THE HOLSTERS AND  SAFES AND BEDROOM TABLE DRAWERS  OF THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT THEM.
Reporter: YOU DON'T KNOW  WHERE?
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF IT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE
Reporter: IN ARIZONA IT'S  LEGAL TO JUST SELL A GUN TO  SOMEONE ON THE STREET.
SURE. WHY NOT?
Reporter: WHY NOT? WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
WHAT INDEED. Reporter: I MEAN A FEW THINGS  BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT  THEM, IT'S FINE.
FREEDOM IS RISKY. Reporter: YES, FREEDOM IS  RISKY. BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED HELLER  FROM TRYING TO MAKE ARIZONA A  BIT SAFER
I'M IN FAVOR OF A GUN LAW TO  STOP GOVERNMENT FROM DESTROYING  GUNS.
Reporter: YOU'RE AGAINST  REGULATION TO PROTECT PEOPLE  FROM GUNS. BUT FOR REGULATION TO PROTECT  GUNS FROM PEOPLE.
YES. Reporter: WHICH IS WHY  ARIZONA IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE TO  BE A GUN. JUST A [BLEEP] PLACE TO BE A  PERSON.
