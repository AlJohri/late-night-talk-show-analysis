Jon: HEY, I HAD TO  TURN-- WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART, GUEST TONIGHT NBC NEWS  ANCHORMAN BRIAN, BRIAN,  BRIAN WILLIAMS. ACTUALLY, FATHER OF DAILY  SHOW CORRESPONDENT JESSICA  WILLIAMS, TRUE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FIRST OF ALL, LET'S GET  TO SOME SERIOUS STUFF. ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE. THE ABOUT THE UNITED STATES  BECOMING INVOLVED IN THE WAR  IN SYRIA. SLOW DOWN, AMERICA. REMEMBER OUR TROOPS ARE  STILL IN AFGHANISTAN AND WE  STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT  FOR SURE WHO WON THE IRAQ  WAR. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE NOMINEES, A WINNER  OF THE IRAQ WAR ARE IRAQ. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND DANIEL-DAY LEWIS. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE WINNER OF THE 2003  TO 2011 IRAQ WAR IS --
ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE  "NEW YORK TIMES," CHINA IS  THE BIGGEST WINNER, ECONOMIC WINNER FROM THE IRAQ WAR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THEY WEREN'T EVEN  NOMINATED! CHINA IS NOT EVEN IN THE  RUNNING. DON'T YOU HAVE TO BE IN A  WAR TO WIN IT? CHINA? CHINA, THEY HAVE ALREADY  BEATEN US IN SYNCHRONIZED  DRUMMING AND BEAR CUTENESS,  AIR CHEW ABILITY. (LAUGHTER)  YOU GOT TO TAKE THIS FROM US  TOO?
CHINA IS THE LEADING  BUYER OF IRAQ OIL PURCHASING  IS 1.5 MILLION BARRELS A DAY OR HALF OF IRAQ'S OUTPUT.
Jon: CHINA IS BUYING  THAT? HUH? I GUESS ALL THOSE PROTESTORS  WERE WRONG. THEY HAD THE NO IN THE WRONG  PLACE. YES, THAT WAS WHAT HAPPENED. THAT'S WHAT WE DID. WE DIED FOR THE NO OIL. HOW DID CHINA GET TO BUY ALL  THE OIL IN IRAQ?
CHINA HAS SPENT MORE THAN  $2 BILLION AND SENT HUNDREDS  OF WORKERS INTO IRAQ TO SECURE A STAKE IN THE OIL  BUSINESS. (LAUGHTER)  IRAQ YOU AWARDED ALL YOUR  OIL CONTRACTS TO CHINA,  IRAQ. I MEAN COME ON, MAN. WE LAUNCHED A SUSTAINED  SHOCK AND AWE BOMBING  CAMPAIGN ON YOUR COUNTRY. WE REDUCED YOUR ALREADY  STRESSED INFRASTRUCTURE TO  RUBBLE AND UNLEASHED  SECTARIAN CONFLICT THAT EVEN NOW COST YOUR COUNTRY  HUNDREDS OF LIVES PER MONTH. AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY  US? (LAUGHTER)  YOU UNGRATEFUL-- CHINA  THINKS OH, WE SPENT $2  BILLION, REBUILDING IRAQ  INFRASTRUCTURE. BIG [BLEEP] DEAL! WHEN WE WERE IN IRAQ WE  SPENT $2 BILLION JUST  LOOKING FOR THE OTHER $9  BILLION WE LOST. APPARENTLY WE SHIPPED IT TO  IRAQ IN A CONTAIN THEIR SAID  $9 BILLION AND SOMEONE RAN OFF WITH IT. WELL, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT DOES THAT SAY? THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A  CUTOUT OF GEORGE W. BUSH. WOULD WE HAVE TO CUT HIM  OUT? I THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE  THAT PICTURE OF HIM JUST  WITH A DIFFERENT SIGN. I DON'T KNOW BY THE WAY IF  THAT ACTUALLY SAYS MISSION  ACCOMPLISHED IN MANDARIN  THAT ACTUALLY COULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT GENERAL  CAOI. I DON'T KNOW. IT DID COST US AT THE SHOW  $2 BILLION. ANYWAY. IT'S NOT FAIR THAT CHINA  GETS ALL THAT-- BLACK GOLD,  LIQUID-- IT'S LIKE IRAQ IS A SLOT-- PORTER AFTER FOR  OTHERS KNOWING THAT ANY  MINUTE IRAQ IS GOING TO PAY  OFF, SAYING WE HAVE TO GET UP TO THE BATHROOM AND DYING  TO SIT DOWN AND BOOM. BLAAAAHHHH! I'M SORRY, COULD WE STOP  THAT? WHAT ARE THOSE, OIL BISCUITS? WHAT WERE THOSE? I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU,  IRAQ. I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU,  CHINA. WE INVADE IRAQ AND CHINA  GETS SPOILS NOT TO MENTION  ALL THAT SWEET MADE IN CHINA YELLOW RIBBON MAGNET MONEY. THEY GET IT EVERY WHICH WAY. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT IS MORE IRONIC THAN  THAT.
CHINA OPPOSED THE  LIBERATION OF IRAQ AND TRIED  TO ARMED SADDAL HUSSEIN  REGIME.
CHINA. THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN  TO HURT US, BUT WE STILL END  UP HELPING THEM. THEY'RE LIKE A BANK OF  AMERICA-- IF BANK OF AMERICA  WAS A COUNTRY. (APPLAUSE)  HOW DID WE NOT SEE THIS  COMING?
THE WAR IS LIKE A DARK  ROOM WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR  YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO END UP.
YES, I BELIEVE THOSE WERE  THE WORDSES OF DECORATED  GENERAL-- YEAH, I BELIEVE THAT ALSO ACCURATELY  DESCRIBED THE PARTY AT-- BUT  THE POINT IS THIS, REALLY? WE'RE DOING JOKES ABOUT THE  WAR IN IRAQ, PEOPLE DYING  AND LIKE WHOOO! ANDY DICK'S HOUSE-- I  THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING.  --
HELPING THE IRAQ PEOPLE  REBUILD THEIR CIVIL SOCIETY. AND THE FREE INSTITUTIONS  THAT SUSTAIN A DEMOCRACY.
PRIOR DIFFICULTIES IRAQ  DOES HAVE AN EMERGING FREE  MARKET WITH AN INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK, AND THOUSANDS  OF SMALL BUSINESSES  OPERATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
ALL RIGHT, THOSE ARE OUR  VALUES. WE GOT INTO IRAQ, IT TURNS  OUT WE SHOW THAT-- THE IT  SEEMS IF THE WAR HAD ANOTHER WINNER THAT WOULD BE US.
THE WINNER OF THE IRAQ  WAR WAS FRANCE.
SON OF A BITCH! I'M STARTING THIS THING THIS  WHOLE IRAQ-- WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK.
