(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. YOU KNOW, ALL SUMMER LONG WE HAVE KEPT YOU UP TO DATE ON DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK.
DANGER ♪ ♪ DANGER  ♪.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, ONE GUY. KEPT YOU UP ON ONE GUY. BUT LET'S GET UP TO SPEED ON THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. YOU GOT YOUR JOHN-- YEAH JONNY CATS. BILLIONAIRE GROCERY STORE OWNER AND POLITICAL CARTOONIST WET DREAM. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, BUDDY?
DAVID USHERY ASKS CATSIMATIDIS TO EXPLAIN HIS REMARKS SUPPORTING STOP AND FRISK. CATSIMATIDIS SAID IF HIS OWN SON WAS STOPPED HE WOULD ASK IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING FUNNY.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT THAT YOU WOULD COUNSEL YOUR SON OR ASK HIM ABOUT THAT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IF HE HAD HIS PANTS HALF DOWN WITH HIS UNDERWEAR SHOWING, IF HE HAD HIS HAT TURNED BACKWARDS.
Jon: REALLY? YOU THINK THE POLICE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR HATS TURNED BACKWARDS OR ARE SHOWING BUTT CRACK BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SUPPORT STOPPING AND FRISKING EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER GONE TO A NEW YORK-BASED SPORTING EVENT. (LAUGHTER) OH WAIT, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. IT'S LIKE HIP-HOP CULTURE, LIKE BLACK KIDS. YOU'RE NOT SAYING THAT RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT MIGHT HURT YOU WITH THE MINORITY VOTE.
ALL THE MINORITIES I HAVE BEEN TO, IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS, THEY LOVE ME. I HAVE A LOVE FACTOR WITH MINORITIES. I HAVE GONE TO EVERY MINORITY NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY ALL GIVE ME HUGS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHO INITIATES THE HUG? I WANT TO SEE IF IT'S LOVE OR POLITENESS, PERHAPS. SURE, YEAH. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN IN NEW YORK IS LIKE DINNER AT RUDY GIULIANI'S HOUSE, SOONER OR LATER SOMEBODY BRINGS UP 9/11.
THE DEBATE DID TURN BACK 12 YEARS TO LHOTA'S HANDLING OF 9/11 AS DEPUTY MAYOR UNDER RUDY GIULIANI.
YOU DON'T PUT 15,000 GALLONS OF KEROSENE ON A HIGH FLOOR THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM AND BROUGHT DOWN THE ENTIRE BUILDING. IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. IT WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR IF JOHN THINKS THAT THE HIGH FLOOR THAT'S HIS ISSUE TO DEAL WITH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WOW. WOW. EXERCISE SLAM. (LAUGHTER) LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF OLD WHEEZY McBREATHES HEAVY CAN'T GET UP TO THE THIRD FLOOR. BY THE WAY, I'M ALSO PRETTY SURE THE KEROSENE ISN'T WHAT CAUSED THE WHOLE THING. PRETTY SURE THERE WAS AN IGNITION TO THAT. IT DOESN'T MATTER, LOOK JONNY CATS IS GOING TO GET CRUSHED, LET'S FACE FACTS, THIS GUY JOE LHOTA IS GOING TO CRUSH HIM.
I NEVER SAID I WANTED TO KILL A CAT.
Jon: OKAY. (LAUGHTER) NOW WE GOT OURSELVES A CONTEST. NEVER SAID I WANTED TO KILL CATS. WHY WOULD YOU EVER HAVE TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT IN A DEBATE?
AS YOU KNOW, A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TRAIN SERVICE WAS HALTED FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS SO TWO STRAY KITTENS COULD BE RESCUED FROM THE TRACK. YOU CANDIDATES HAD DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WHETHER YOU WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE TRAIN. SO MR. LHOTA, I'M WONDERING, ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH BEING THE ANTI-KITTEN CANDIDATE.
WHAT I SAID WAS IT'S UP TO THE PERSON WHO IS RUNNING THE MTA TO MAKE THAT DECISION, IT'S NOT A MAYORAL DECISION.
Jon: LOOK HOW SERIOUS HE HAS TO BE ANSWERING THE KITTEN QUESTION. DO YOU WANT TO BE THE ANTI-KITTEN MAYOR! ! (LAUGHTER) THAT IS A PRETTY COLD HEARTED STANCE TO TAKE ABOUT AN INNOCENT KITTEN WHO IS JUST TRYING TO GET TO WORK ON TIME. (LAUGHTER)
