Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT EMMY  AWARD WINNING ACTOR CURRENTLY  STARRING OFF BROADWAY IN THE  MADRID. "NURSE JACKIE" IS RETURNING FOR  THE FIFFEN SEASON ON SUNDAY.
WE'RE GOING TO FINISH  CONVERSATION.
AND WHAT IS THIS CONVERSATION  ABOUT?
DR. ROMAN HAS HAD EVERY BUMP  IN THE ROAD SMOOTHED OVER  BECAUSE SHE'S --
HOT.
EXPECTING IT. NEXT TIME SHE'S NOT COVERING  SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING.
I DID.
AND BACK IT UP.
NICE OF HIM TO REMEMBER.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW EDIE FALCO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EDIE FALCO IS HERE. I LOVE EDIE FALCO. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: BEFORE WE GO, TAKING  IT BACK PEOPLE ARE NOT  ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING YOU IN A MORE CHESTNUT -- THIS IS FOR THE  OFF BROADWAY.
FOR THE MADRID, YEAH, THE  PLAY I'M DOING.
Jon: HOW MUCH LONGER ARE  YOU DOING THAT?
THROUGH MAY 5.
Jon: IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN  EDIE FALCO LIVE ON STAGE YOU  HAVE A PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] NURSE JACKIE WHEN WE LEFT OFF  YOU WERE NOT ON DRUGS ANYMORE?
LET ME SEE:  NO. AH, NO.
Jon: HAVE YOU SEEN THE  PROGRAM?
I HAVE NOT SEEN THE PROGRAM. I CAN'T AFFORD SHOWTIME.
Jon: THOSE CABLE PACKAGES  WILL KILL YOU. [LAUGHTER] WHICH MAKES ME WONDER IS THIS  NEW SEASON JUST A WELL ADJUSTED  NURSE WHO IS REALLY GOOD AT HER  JOB? BECAUSE THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS  PERSON WHO IS SO GOOD AT WHAT  THEY DO YET HAS SUCH A DIFFICULT TIME IN THEIR LIFE THAT TENSION  IS COMPELLING, IF I MAY.
THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL. SECOND OF ALL, I THINK A COMPLEX  PERSON WHO USES DRUGS IS STILL A  COMPLEX PERSON WHEN THEY DON'T USE DRUGS.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING THERE'S  A WAKE EVEN WHEN NOT USING  DRUGS.
THINGS REGULAR PEOPLE TAKE  FOR GRANTED ARE DIFFICULT  BECAUSE SHE HAS TO DO IT IN A WAY IN WHICH SHE'S PRESENT.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU  SOMETHING?
PLEASE DO.
Jon: YOU JUST DREW ME IN.
ONE VIEWER!
Jon: STOP IT. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THIS  BECAUSE FOR SO MANY ACTORS, THE  IDEA OF HAVING A DEFINING ROLE FOR THEIR CAREER IS ONE OF THE  MOST FORTUNATE THINGS THAT CAN  HAPPEN TO AN ACTOR. IT'S VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE  SOMEBODY HAVE A DEFINING RULE  LIKE YOU HAD IN THE SOPRANOS AND TO MOVE ALMOST SEEMLESSLY INTO  ANOTHER REALLY DEFINING ROLE IN  THIS SHOW AS WELL. WAS THAT -- IS THAT A DIFFICULT  TRANSITION TO MAKE. IS THERE A REASON WHY SO MANY  ACTORS HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING  THAT TRANSITION? IS IT SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT  ABOUT CONSCIOUSLY TO TRY AND DO.
I THOUGHT ABOUT VERY LITTLE  CONSCIOUSLY. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S START THERE I'M AFRAID TO  TALK ABOUT IT.
Jon: I GET THAT.
IT'S THE TREMENDOUS GOOD  FORTUNE OF I HAVE OF BEING ABLE  TO HAVE HAD A CAREER LIKE THIS AND LIVE IN NEW YORK. WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE, I'M  GOING TO GET ARRESTED, THAT KIND  OF FEELING. ALL I HAD TO GO BY WAS SOMETHING  I HOPED WOULD INTEREST ME BEYOND  SOPRANOS. SOPRANOS OFFICE IS FULFILLING ON  SO MANY LEVELS I KNEW TRYING TO  FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD KEEP ME EXCITED WOULD BE CHALLENGE  ENOUGH. WHEN I READ THE FIRST SCRIPT OF  NURSE JACKIE I SAID LET'S SEE  WHERE THIS GOES.
Jon: HOW LONG WAS THE  DECOMPRESSION PROCESS FOR YOU  AFTER SOPRANOS BEFORE YOU COULD SEE A SCRIPT AGAIN? HOW LONG DID YOU GIVE YOURSELF?
THREE HOURS.
Jon: THE INSECURITY OF THE  ACTING LIFE.
YOU DON'T KNOW. AT THE WRAP PARTY I WAS READING  NEW STUFF. I READ A LOT OF STUFF RIGHT AWAY  BECAUSE I LIKE TO WORK. I DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING FOR SO  LONG I THOUGHT MAYBE I'M DONE. MAYBE I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING  ELSE NOW. AND I THINK IT'S JUST THERE  WEREN'T A LOT OF GOOD THINGS  UNTIL I READ THIS. THIS WAS CALLED "NURSE MONA" AT  THE TIME.
Jon: WHO WOULD WATCH THAT?
FIRST THING WE DID CHANGE THE  NAME. AND IT WAS MUCH DARKER. I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLACE, A  CHARACTER THAT I WOULD LIKE TO  EXPLORE.
Jon: GETTING BACK TO THE  THEATER THAT FEEDS ANOTHER --
I'M LUCKY I GET TO DO ALL OF  THESE THINGS. I STARTED DOING THEATER ON LONG  ISLAND AND IT WAS THE FIRST  THING THAT EXCITED ME. IT'S VERY, VERY HARD WORK.
Jon: YES.
AND IT REMINDS ME THAT THIS  IS HARD WORK AND I'M LUCKY TO  HAVE A CAREER IN THIS BUSINESS.
Jon: DO THE PALS FROM THE  ISLAND COME IN WHEN YOU ARE ON  BROADWAY. IT'S IN YOUR HOMETOWN. THEY SAY WHEN ATHLETES WHEN THEY  GO BACK TO THE TOWN THEY GREW UP  IN EVERYBODY COMES IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE, DO YOU HAVE THAT?
WELL, I LEAVE THE THEATER SO  QUICKLY AFTERWARDS I HAVE NO  IDEA WHO IS AT THE PLAY.
Jon: NEVER GAVE ME YOUR  E-MAIL ADDRESS. FALCO I'LL BE THERE --
YOU ARE A BIT OF A SITTING  DUCK. ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE. THERE'S PEOPLE I DON'T RECOGNIZE  OR REMEMBER WHICH IS ANOTHER  STORY. ANYBODY CAN COME SEE THE PLAY.
Jon: IT'S TREMENDOUS. YOUR TREMENDOUS. WE LOVE WATCHING YOU WORK.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SHOWTIME THING SEASON  FIVE SUNDAY NIGHT.
SUNDAY NIGHT.
Jon: THE MADRID RUNS FIVE  WEEKS.
I GET A NAP AND I'LL READ  SCRIPTS AROUND MAY 10.
Jon: SOUNDS PERFECT. THE MADRID, NEW SEASON OF NURSE  JACKIE SUNDAY.
