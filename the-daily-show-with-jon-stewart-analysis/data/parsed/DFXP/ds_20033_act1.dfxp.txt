FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, MAN, WE ARE LUCKY, A TRUE, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES YOU SAY A LEGENDARY PERFORMER. THIS GUY IS THE LEGEND OF LEGENDS, NORMAN LEAR IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BOOM, "ALL IN THE FAMILY," "THE JEFFERSONS." BUT FIRST, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PROGRAM I LIKE TO CHECK IN WITH CONGRESS. AND WHEN I SAY, OBVIOUSLY LIKE TO CHECK IN, I MEAN FORCE OURSELVES. WHILE GAGGING. THE, THE, YOU KNOW,  CONGRESS'S APPROVAL RATING RECENTLY HAS SURGED FROM A PATHETIC 10% ALL THE WAY UP TO -- YEAH, 11%. (LAUGHTER) BASICALLY, PUTS THEM RIGHT BELOW EXPLOSIVE CRUISE SHIP DIARRHEA AND RIGHT ABOVE TIME WARNER CABLE. (LAUGHTER) SO 9% APPROVAL, THEY MUST HAVE GOTTEN BETTER. BUT 11% IS STILL A LONG WAY FROM A PASSING GRADE. TO REACH THAT CONGRESS IS GOING TO HAVE TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT IS SO POPULAR, SO NONPARTISAN, SO TOTALLY UNOJECTIONABLE THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY COULD UNITE BUT WHAT ARE THE ODDS?
I RISE TODAY TO URGE PASSAGE OF HR 5739, THE NO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR NAZI'S ACT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT WILL DO. (LAUGHTER) THE NO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR NAZIS ACT. A BILL SO UNCONTROVERSIAL CONGRESS DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO HIDE IT. ITS TRUE PURPOSE BEHIND A DISINGENUOUS MADE UP NAME LIKE PATRIOT ACT, OR FREEDOM ACT, OR BALD PATRIOTIC USA FREEDOM ACT FOR FREE PATRIOTS LIBERTY BALD EAGLE BASEBALL HAMBURGER ACT. THIS SEEMS PRETTY NONDEBATABLE. (LAUGHTER) SO LET'S-- LET'S GO TO THE DEBATE.
SOCIAL SECURITY IS AN EARNED BENEFIT THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN HORRIFIC ACTS OF THE HOLOCAUST. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I WOULD IMAGINE MOST GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROGRAMS ARE NOT INTENDED TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE NAZIS. (LAUGHTER) WELL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CASH FOR KLINKERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE) HOGAN! YES, CONGRESS IS HELD IN SUCH LOW ESTEEM THAT EVEN WHILE PASSING A BILL BANNING SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS TO NAZIS SEVERAL MEMBERS FELT THE NEED TO MAKE IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE ANTI-NAZI.
I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO END THIS OUTRAGE.
CUT OFF BENEFITS ANYONE STRIPPED OF THEIR U.S. CITIZENSHIP RELATED TO THEIR PARTICIPATION IN NAZI CRIMES.
THEY COMMITTED HEINOUS CRIMES.
MR. SPEAKER, I URGE ALL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE TO VOTE YES AND PASS THE NO SOCIAL SECURITY TO NAZIS ACT TODAY.
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO URGE PEOPLE DO THIS? WHO ARE YOU URGING CONGRESSMAN DENNIS WHITEPOWER?  NOW WAIT, HOLD ON THERE, LET'S NOT RUSH INTO ANYTHING, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! BUT  BRAVO CONGRESS ON YOUR COURAGEOUS ANTI-SOCIAL SECURITY FOR NAZIS STAND. I CANT' BELIEVE YOU WASTED THE NATION'S TIME MAKING YOURSELF LOOK GOOD BY PASSING A BILL TO STOP SOMETHING THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN IN A MILLION YEARS ANYWAY.
AS OF NOW THERE IS A LOOPHOLE ALLOWING FORMER NAZIES TO COLLECT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS. FORMER AUSCHWITZ GUARD JAKOB DENZINGER WHO FLED THE U.S. IN 1989 BUT STILL GETS ABOUT $1500 A MONTH WHILE LIVING IN CROATIA. AN ASSOCIATED PRESS INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFERED PAYMENTS TO NAZIS AS INCENTIVE TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, DON'T I LOOK STUPID. REALLY, WE HAVE NO OTHER WAY OF MAKING NAZIS GO AWAY? BUT TO BRIBE THEM? SEE HERE, YOU NAZI MONSTER. I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH SO THAT I CAN DELIVER YOU THESE MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS. WE CAN PUT THEM DIRECTLY IN YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, BUT FIRST I HAVE TO ASK YOU, IS IT SAFE? NOW YOU GOT THE KLINK THING, I THOUGHT THE MARATHON MAN WOULD GO TOO. SEE IT TURNS OUT THAT AFTER WORLD WAR II WE GRANTED CITIZENSHIP TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS LET'S CALL THEM EUROPEAN GENTLEMEN ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER WHEN THEY LISTED THEIR OLD JOB AS CAMP COUNSELOR -- BUT RATHER THAN GO THROUGH THE LENGTHY AND DIFFICULT PROCESS OF DEPORTING THEM, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONVINCED THEM TO SELF-DEPORT WITH A SORT OF CITIZENSHIP SEVERANCE PACKAGE ALTHOUGH THEY CALLED IT SOMETHING ELSE.
IT BECAME KNOWN AS NAZI DUMPING.
NAZI DUMPING.
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE BEST SELLING SCAT PORN DVD IN GERMANY WHICH IS TO SAY THE BEST SELLING DVD IN GERMANY. LIKE ANY DUMP WHEN YOU FLUSH IT AWAY IT JUST WASHES UP SOMEWHERE ELSE.
TROUBLE WAS, ONCE THEY FOUND THEM NOBODY WANTED THEM.  YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BLOWBACK WHEN SOMEONE-- UNWANTED WOULD SHOW UP IN ANOTHER COUNTRY UNANNOUNCED.
YEAH, YOU THINK NAZI WAS BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT BLOW BACK. I'M PRETTY SURE SHOWING UP UNWANTED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY UNANNOUNCED, KIND OF THEIR CALLING CARD. APPARENTLY OF ALL OUR ALLIES AUSTRIA WAS PARTICULARLY FURIOUS WHEN WE SENT THEM A FORMER CONCENTRATION CAMP GUARD WITHOUT WARNING. THAT'S RIGHT, AUSTRIA, COMPLAINING ABOUT ANOTHER COUNTRY FOISTING NAZIS ON IT, AUSTRIA, THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE EXPORTER OF ADOLF HITLERS. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JORDAN KLEPPER. JORDAN, THANKS FOR JOINING US! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  JORDAN, HOW DOES IT FEEL-- HOW DOES IT FEEL TO SEE CONGRESS ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE FOR ONCE?
IT FEELS LIKE A KICK IN THE NUTS, JON. THIS BILL IS AN OUTRAGE. SHAME ON CONGRESS FOR TAKING BENEFITS AWAY FROM WAR VETERANS.
Jon: JORDAN, JORDAN I THINK YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.
JON, THE POINT IS HISTORY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAR THESE MEN FOUGHT IN?
Jon: WORD WAR II.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATEST GENERATION.
Jon: NO. NO. NO.
NOT THE OKAY GENERATION, NOT THAT COULD BE WORSE GENERATION, THE, GREATEST HEROES WHO DESERVE OUR THANKS.
Jon: NO, NO. JORDAN, THEY'RE NOT HEROES, THEY DIDN'T FIGHT FOR US. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING BENEFITS FROM NAZIS.
NAZIS? JON, THESE ARE BRAVE SERVICEMEN, NOT NAZIS.
Jon: WHAT? I WON'T YOU HAVE SLANDER MEN LIKE-- LIKE GRUPPENFUHRER HELMUT WOLFENSTEIN. OKAY, THAT DOES SOUND GERMAN OR SS REICHKOMMADANT CLAUSE VON TEUFEL-- YEAH, THESE GUYS ARE NAZIS. TOTALLY GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WE WERE GIVING SOCIAL SECURITY TO NAZIS? THAT'S [BLEEP] UP.
YES IT IS [BLEEP] UP. JORDAN, THAT IS, THAT IS.
WHOA, WHOA. I PLANNED TO READ LIKE AN INSPIRING HOMILY ABOUT PERSECUTION.
Jon: YEAH, I KNOW.
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK IF I IT MAKE IT ABOUT NAZIS.
Jon: NO IT DOESN'T, BUT PLEASE, INDULGE US.
PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.
READ YOUR HOMILY, JORDAN.
NO PLEASE -- FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE NAZIS, AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I WAS NOT A NAZI.
Jon: YEAH, IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK WITH NAZI, DOES IT? KEEP GOING.
NO. REALLY? OKAY, THEN THEY CAME FOR -- I, I -- WHAT IS WORSE THAN NAZI? NAZI ZOMBIES AND -- SERIOUSLY, WE WERE GIVING THEM SOCIAL SECURITY?
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
