(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW SERIES CALLED "POLITICAL ANIMALS."
FORGET THE PRESS CONFERENCE IF WE DON'T DRAW A LINE IN THE  STAND WITH HARRIS AND THE WHITE HOUSE...
YOU COULD HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF FIRED FOR THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IN FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT. HE'S NOT JUST A BOSS, HE IS NOT YOUR FLOOR MANAGER AT CHILIS. HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS SDRAGS IS TRADING ON MY POPULARITY IS NOT WHAT MATTERS NOW. ALL THAT MATTERS NOW ARE THE THREE SCARED INNOCENT PEOPLE SITTING IN A JAIL CELL IN  TORONTO WONDERING WHAT THE HELL THEIR COUNTRY IS DOING TO HELP THEM. ARE WE CLEAR?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SIGOURNEY WEAVER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: LET ME GET STRAIGHT IF I CAN.
UH-OH.
Jon: THE WOMAN WHO WAS MARRIED TO THE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT CHEATS ON HER, SHE  HERSELF RUNS FOR PRESIDENT, LOSES, NOW SHE HAS BEEN APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE BY THE PERSON THAT SHE RAN AGAINST. IT'S IMPLAUSIBLE.
SO IMPLAUSIBLE. (LAUGHTER) NOT IN A MILLION YEARS CAN YOU COME UP WITH OBAMA. SO ABSURD.
Jon: WERE YOU THINKING... OH, DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE TO MODEL IT AFTER HILLARY CLINTON OR DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO  ACTUALLY GO THE OTHER DIRECTION?
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY AS SOON AS I STARTED READING THE FIRST PAGE I WAS SO HOOKED ON  THE CHARACTER OF ELAINE AND ON THE FAMILY OF THE HAMMONDS WHO I HAVE TO SAY ARE INSPIRED PERHAPS  IN PART BY THE CLINTONS BUT ALSO BY THE JOHNSONS, ALSO BY THE KENNEDYS. IT'S ABOUT THIS FASCINATING FAMILY WHO WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHO WERE PROBABLY SCARRED  BY THAT EXPERIENCE IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS BUT WHO NOW DYSFUNCTIONAL AS WE ARE ARE  TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE. SO IT RIPS ASIDE THE VEIL ON A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES WHO....
Jon: DYNASTIC FAMILIES. WE HAVE DYNASTYS IN AMERICA.
AND I THINK WE THINK OF THEM AS AMERICAN ROYALTY AND HE'S A POLITICAL JUNKY. HE'S VERY....
Jon: HE'S A JUNKY. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE WORKING FOR A HEROIN ADDICT.
EXACTLY. WHO ELSE WOULD BE IN THIS BUSINESS?
Jon: I DON'T THINK ANYBODY. HAVE YOU GOTTEN TO SPEND ANY TIME IN THAT DYNASTIC WORLD WITH THE KENNEDYS OR BUSHES OR CLINTONS?
NO, BUT I'M SURE YOU HAVE.
Jon: NO! THE KENNEDYS NEVER CALL ME. (LAUGHTER)
WOW.
Jon: THE BUSHES DO BUT USUALLY THE EXPLETIVES AND I HANG UP. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON CALLS BUT I'M A BUSY MAN. (LAUGHTER)
I LIKE HAVING THEM ON THE PEDESTAL BUT WHAT'S FUN ABOUT  THIS SHOW IT'S A VERY... YOU SORT OF TAKE THEM... YOU GO BEHIND THE SCENES AND SEE THEM  OFF THE PEDESTAL.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU AND ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE AND NO MATTER  HOW HIGH POWERED THESE PEOPLE ARE AND HOW CAPABLE... AND I THINK I PLAY A WOMAN IN  WASHINGTON WHO REALLY IS... SHE IS... SHE DOES SEE THE BIG PICTURE. SHE SAYS THE RIGHT THINGS. SHE'S VERY PASSIONATE, STRONG MORAL COMPASS. THEN SHE GOES HOME AND IN HER OWN KITCHEN SHE CAN'T HANDLE ANYTHING. SO IT'S VERY....
Jon: I CAN SEE YOUR ENTHUSIASM. YOU KNOW, DOES THAT HAPPEN OFTEN THAT THE SYNAPSES BEGIN TO FIRE ON A CHARACTER? HOW MUCH DRECK DO YOU WADE THROUGH BEFORE YOU FIND THESE... IS IT DIFFICULT TO FIND SOMETHING THAT GETS YOUR EYES SPARKED UP?
I THINK IT IS THESE DAYS FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND, QUITE FRANKLY, ALTHOUGH I WASN'T LOOKING FOR T.V., I WAS A VERY HAPPY GUILTY CABLE TELEVISION WATCHER.
Jon: SURE. CABLE IS VERY UNDERRATED. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A BRILLIANT BUSINESS.
THIS STORY COULD HAVE AMBUSHED ME BECAUSE IF YOU'D SAID THIS PARALLELS WITH HILLARY  CLINTON I'D GO "WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY ARE THEY COMING TO ME FOR THIS? I SHOULD BE PLAYING SOME SHERIFF IN ALASKA OR SOMETHING." (LAUGHTER)  BUT, IN FACT... THAT'S WHAT I'M KNOWN... SOMETHING ABOUT THE IDITAROD AND DOGS AND... YOU KNOW? NOT THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHO'S SO WELL SPOKEN AND....
Jon: NO! THE FILM, THE BIG SCREEN YOU'RE DOING THE OTHER THINGS. SO IT'S NICE.
I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING A  CABLE STORY CAN DO TELLING A DIFFERENT EPISODE EVERY WEEK WHERE IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF  GETTING TO KNOW PEOPLE.
Jon: THERE'S MORE IMMEDIACY TO IT. AREN'T YOU DOING... "AVATAR" HAS TWO SEQUELS BUT DON'T YOU HAVE  TO FILM THOSE OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD IN AN UNDERGROUND VOLCANO?
HOW DID YOU KNOW? I GOT THAT MEMO BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A SECRET.
Jon: WHEN YOU GUYS WERE FILMING THAT... THIS IS COMPLETELY OFF TOPIC. WHEN YOU SEE JAMES CAMERON, DO YOU EVER SAY TO HIM "UNOBTAINIUM REALLY?" (LAUGHTER)  WAS THERE EVER THAT MOMENT WHERE YOU WERE LIKE "I KNOW YOU'RE A  GENIUS BUT... HELLO?" (LAUGHTER) NEVER? NEVER?
(LAUGHS) NO.
Jon: ALTHOUGH IT APPARENTLY WAS DISCUSSED AT THE WRAP PARTY. BUT THIS IS GOOD. WHEN IS THIS THING ON?
IT PLAYS SUNDAY NIGHT AT 10:00. IT'S A TREAT. I ESPECIALLY WANT WOMEN TO SEE IT. AFTER YOU FOUND THE KIDS' SHORTS FOR CAMP AND THE HOCKEY STICKS  AND EVERYTHING ELSE JUST GRAB A GLASS OF WINE, PUT YOUR FEET UP AND WATCH THIS DELICIOUS SHOW.
Jon: IF YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS AND YOU FIND THOSE SHORTS AND THE HOCKEY STICK... (LAUGHTER)
EVEN MORE REASON.
Jon: I WOULD SAY MORE WINE. "POLITICAL ANIMALS" WITH THE GREAT SIGOURNEY WEAVER AIRS U.S.A. SUNDAY NIGHT AT 10:00. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
