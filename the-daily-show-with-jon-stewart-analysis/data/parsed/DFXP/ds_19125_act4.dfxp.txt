Jon: COME ON. HOW DO YOU OPEN WITH, HEY, HOW'S ENGLAND DOING AFTER THEIR WORLD CUP LOST? STPUID. WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS WRONG WITH ME? AND SHE'S IN A MOVIE CALLED "BEGIN AGAIN." IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PERFECT SEGUE TO LIKE, "OH, LET ME BEGIN AGAIN BECAUSE SOMETIMES I SUCK AT THIS." WELL, I'VE ONLY BEEN DOING IT FOR 16 YEARS. SO, I'LL LEARN. THAT'S OUR SHOW. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
I KNOW IT IS POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT THESE DAYS TO SAY THAT AMERICA SHOULD NOT APOLOGIZE FOR ITS REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD, BUT PERHAPS WE CAN AT LEAST MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR, I DON'T KNOW, AMERICANS WHO GO TO GERMANY AND GET STUCK IN SCULPTURES OF GIANT VAGINAS.
