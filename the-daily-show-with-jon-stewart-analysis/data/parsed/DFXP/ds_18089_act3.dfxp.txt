( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE STAR OF MAD  MEN, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW  CHRISTINA HENDRICKS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). THANKS FOR BEING HERE. OH, JOAN, JOAN, JOAN. OH, SWEET JOAN.
POOR JOAN. Jon: POOR JOAN. I KNOW. Jon: WHAT'S A GUY TO DO? ONE HIT AFTER ANOTHER, IT  SEEMS.
Jon: IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM  FAIR. SHE IS THE ONLY CHARACTER THAT I  FEEL LIKE SHOULD STILL BE ALIVE  IN THE '70s.
WHY IS THAT? WHY IS SHE THE ONLY ONE?
Jon: BECAUSE THERE'S  SOMETHING STILL GOOD ABOUT JOAN.
SHE TRIES TO BE GOOD, I  THINK.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT THIS FOR JOAN  IN THE '70s, A SPIN-OFF WHERE  IT'S JUST YOU AND YOU SOLVE MYSTERIES IN A VAN?
ABSOLUTELY. Jon: JOAN. USES HER FEMININE WE'LLS TO  SOLVE CRIMES.
Jon: WHY NOT? I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT  TOO. YOU KNOW, DO YOU READ YOUR  SCRIPTS? AND DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF AS  YOU'RE READING DOWN BECAUSE THE  MEN IN THIS SHOW ARE TERRIBLE  PEOPLE.
MAKING SOME BAD DECISIONS. Jon: YES. BUT DO YOU EVER READ TO SCRIPTS  AND THINK TO YOURSELF, THAT  STILL HAPPENS? YEAH, THAT STILL HAPPENS IN  MODERN LIFE? THAT IS THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN. WHILE IT HAS IMPROVED IT HAS NOT  ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE  THESE ARE THE TYPES OF MISTREATMENTS THAT ARE SO  UNUSUAL THAT THEY'RE EXTINCT?
ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT ALL THE TIME. IN FACT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT  WE GET ALMOST ALL THE TIME. OH, MY GOSH, ARE YOU GLAD THINGS  ARE SO DIFFERENT? CAN'T YOU BELIEVE IT? THANK GOODNESS. YEAH, I MEAN, I WOULD RATHER  LIVE IN 2013 ANY DAY BUT THOSE  SCRIPTS ARE RIGHT. THEY'RE DOING THINGS WE CAN ALL  RELATE TO TODAY. I THINK THAT'S WHY PEOPLE  RESPOND TO THE SHOW AS WELL.
Jon: ALSO BECAUSE IT IS... THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS I THINK  PART OF THE ALLURE IS THE  SEDUCTIVENESS AND THE BEHAVIOR AND THE CONSEQUENCES DON'T CATCH  UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF EPISODES  FROM THEN. SO IT REALLY IS LIKE LIFE.
IT REALLY IS. BUT I DO LIKE THAT WE DO  PERIODICALLY SHOW THE  CONSEQUENCES WHICH I THINK IS  IMPORTANT. I LIKE WHEN AN EPISODE STARTS  WITH THIS HACKING, WAKING UP AND  COUGHING AND COUGHING AND COUGHING AND YOU'RE LIKE, YEP,  THAT WILL DO IT.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN  DAN RATHER IS ON TV SELLING  CIGARETTES, THAT WILL DO IT FOR  YOU. THE THING ABOUT DRAPER IS THAT  EARLY ON WHEN HE FIRST CAME OUT  LIKE ALL THOSE HABITS HE'S DANGEROUS AND COOL. THEN A COUPLE SEASONS GO BY AND  YOU'RE LIKE OH, MY GOD, WHAT A  SAD LOSER. SLOWLY IT SHOWS THE  DETERIORATION OF THOSE CHOICES  AND WHAT IT BEGINS, THE  CORROSIVENESS THAT IT HAS ON  PEOPLE. ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.
I THINK THAT'S WHY AN  EXTRAORDINARY JOB OF STORY  TELLING BECAUSE IT IS SORT OF EMOTIONAL TO FEEL THAT, TO START  OUT FEELING LIKE I WANT TO BE  THIS GUY, THIS GUY IS COOL. AND HE GETS THE LADIES AND LOOKS  GOOD.
Jon: YOU KNOW. CANCEL THE CONSEQUENCES THINGS,  YOU'RE RIGHT. I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT GUY. YOU JUST DESCRIBED IT AGAIN AND  I'M LIKE, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S THE THING EVEN WITH  ALL THE CONSEQUENCES PEOPLE  STILL THINK IT LOOKS GLAMOROUS AND IT'S INTRIGUING.
Jon: THE THING THAT IS  INTERESTING TO ME IS I WAS ALIVE  IN THE '60s. I DON'T REMEMBER IT SO WELL BUT  I REMEMBER THE CONSEQUENCES  REALLY HITTING THE FAN IN THE  '70s. LIKE ALL THE INTRIGUE OF THE  '60s, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE ON  NEW YEAR'S EVE IN 1970 THEY'RE LIKE STAY TUNED, EVERYONE'S  LIVES ARE GOING TO BLOW UP. THAT'S THAT WHOLE DECADE OF LIKE  I'M OKAY-YOU'RE OKAY. MY MOM USED TO HAVE A SHIRT THAT  SAID A WOMAN NEEDS A MAN LIKE A  FISH NEEDS A BICYCLE AND ME AND MY BROTHER ARE LIKE, ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, WALKING AROUND THE  HOUSE, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS  AND LISTEN TO PINK FLOYD.
YEAH, I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH  CHANGE. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE  REASONS MATT WROTE ABOUT THIS  DECADE IN PARTICULAR IS IT WAS SORT OF THIS HAZY GLOW OF  EVERYTHING IS OKAY AND IT'S  INTERESTING TO LOOK BACK. IT'S NOT THAT LONG AGO. AND YET IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE  FANTASY.
Jon: THIS IS ONE OF THOSE  SHOWS WHERE PEOPLE'S INTEREST IN  THE EPISODES ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S  HAPPENING. LIKE DO THEY TELL YOU, DO THEY  GO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE  YOUR SEASON. IT'S GREAT. OR ARE THEY LIKE A GUARD COMES  WITH TWO PAGES OF SCRIPT AND HE  SITS THERE AND READS IT. YOU MEMORIZE THIS. HERE.
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF  BOTH. I MEAN PEOPLE WHO COME ON AND  ARE MAYBE JUST IN ONE EPISODE  THEM DON'T GET THE FULL SCRIPT. THEY'LL JUST GET THE PAGES AND  WHAT TO SAY. BUT OVER THE YEARS, I USUALLY  CALL MATT AT THE BEGINNING OF  THE SEASON AND OKAY TELL ME  EVERYTHING. HE'S LIKE OKAY. HE'LL START WITH ONE STORY LINE  AND SORT OF GIVE ME AN OVERVIEW  OF THE SEASON. SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS MAKE IT  IN. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T. SOMETIMES THE STORY TELLING GETS  A LITTLE VEERED ONE WAY OR THE  OTHER BUT THIS SEASON WAS THE FIRST TIME HE DIDN'T GIVE ME  ANYTHING. I'D CALL HIM AND HE'D GO I DON'T  KNOW YET. I WOULD GO I'LL BE PATIENT.
Jon: DO YOU DIE? YES. YES, I DO.
Jon: JOAN REINCARNATED  SOLVING MYSTERIES. ALL RIGHT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW MAD  MEN AIRS ON A.M.C. SUNDAY NIGHT  AT 9:00. CHRISTINA HENDRICKS, KEEP IT  GOING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
