MAY 17, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO "THE DAILY ANTHENAEUM" SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT, FOLKS. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ANNIE JACOBSEN. SHE'S AUTHOR OF THE BOOKARY" 51." SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING  A LITTLE BIT OF TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN? TRUTH. [LAUGHTER] NOW, OBVIOUSLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES  THAT WE'VE HAD TO DISCUSS HERE ON THE PROGRAM, ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WAYLAID BY PERHAPS  MORE PRESSING ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD TO DISCUSS, LIKE THE DEATH  OF BIN LADEN, THE HARD-CORE PORN IN BIN LADEN'S HOUSE. [LAUGHTER] HARD-CORE POETS, RHYMING IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, AND FINALLY THE DISTRACTIONS ARE OVER. WE HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" CAN GET BACK TO OUR CORE MISSION, DISCUSSING THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY, SUCH AS IMMIGRATION POLICY IN A RESPECTFUL, SOBER MANNER. YOU'RE WELCOME. [LAUGHTER] TO THE DEBATE.
IN A BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT, FORMER CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER NOW ADMITS TO FATHERING A CHILD WITH A  LONGTIME HOUSEHOLD STAFFER.
Jon: OH, FOR [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] THIS CLOSE. DAMN YOU NEARLY IRRESISTIBLE COMIC POSSIBILITIES. FUNNY ACCENT, BUILT-IN MOVIE POSTER FUN. SURE, YES, OBVIOUSLY, SURE. YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T EVEN WRITE THESE TONIGHT. WE JUST SHOWED UP HERE THIS MORNING AND THEY WERE ALREADY HERE. [LAUGHTER] SOME TYPE OF SNARK FAIRY. OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. THAT'S... I DON'T THINK... WELL, THAT ACTUALLY COULD BE "KINDERGARTEN COOK."  [LAUGHTER] QUIRK? AH, [BLEEPED]. SOME OF HIS MOVIE TITLES WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE. YEAH. OR YEAH. [LAUGHTER] HERE'S THE WORST PART ACTED ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S BALLS THAT I DID NOT REALIZE, APPARENTLY THEY ARE PINNED ON LIKE YOU WOULD DO IN A CHILDREN'S GAME OF PIN THE BALLS  ON THE SCHWARZENEGGER. THE QUESTION IS: WHICH ONE OF THOSE BALLS IS SCHWARZENEGGER AND WHICH ONE IS DANNY DeVITO? WHO KNOWS WHICH ONE THEY'LL VOICE. BUT NO, NO, RESIST, RESIST, STAY FOCUSED. WE'RE DOING IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THAT IS THE ISSUE OUR PRESIDENT  CHOSE TO FOCUS ON JUST AFTER HE FLEW TO PAKISTAN AND KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN WITH HIS BARE HANDS. IN THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTION SINCE F.D.R. ROLLED OVER HITLER IN A WHEELCHAIR. YEAH, YOU'RE GOING DOWN, HITLER! REALLY? NOBODY WATCHES THE HISTORY CHANNEL? NOBODY? [LAUGHTER] WELL, DON'T. LISTEN TO BARACK OBAMA IN HIS FIRST NON-BIN LADEN DEATH-RELATED APPEARANCE.
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO KEEP UP THE FIGHT TO PASS GENUINE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. LOOK AT YOU, SPENDING ALL THAT BIN LADEN CAPITAL ON AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL ISSUE. WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?
STOPPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ALSO DEPENDS ON REFORMING OUR OUTDATED SYSTEM OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION. BUSINESSES HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY EXPLOIT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS SO THAT  THERE'S NO LONGER A MASSIVE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT EXPLOITS A CHEAP SOURCE OF LABOR. WE NEED TO PROVIDE OUR FARMS A LEGAL WAY TO HIRE WORKERS. WE SHOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST. WE NEED TO PASS THE DREAM ACT.
Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF STUFF TO DO. I MEAN, THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE LIST, BUT HERE'S THE THING, ARE  YOU THE "KILL BIN LADEN" OBAMA SAYING THIS OR THE "I'M GOING TO  CLOSE GITMO" OBAMA SAYING, THIS BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THOSE TUESDAY ACTUALLY GETS [BLEEPED] DONE. HMM? SO IF IMMIGRATION REFORM FACES SUCH AN UPHILL BATTLE, WHY IS OBAMA TAKING IT ON NOW? FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY OUR NEW CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL, OUR SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT. NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AL, PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. YOU ARE AND YOU WILL BE... YOU WILL BE OUR SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT.
IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED SENOR, JON, BUT THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jon: WELL, IT'S INTERESTING OBAMA IS RAISING THIS WHOLE IMMIGRATION DEBATE NOW.
AH, NOT REALLY. I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE CINCO DE MAYO, JON, ONCE A YEAR YOU GUYS  FEIGN INTEREST IN OUR CULTURE BY ORDERING A PLATTER OF FAJITAS AT  AN APPLEBY'S AND THE NEXT DAY WE'RE BACK TO BEING THE VALET  YOU DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH. BUT GUESS WHAT, BARACK, WE AIN'T NOBODY'S FAJITAS.
Jon: THAT WAS NICE. YOU ACTUALLY THINK OBAMA THEN IS NOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS? YOU THINK HE'S PANDERING?
COME ON, JON, HE'S HAD HIS WHOLE TERM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT  IMMIGRATION AND HE'S JUST BRINGING IT UP NOW? THAT WOULD BE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, HAVING YOUR OWN SHOW FOR 12 YEARS, HIRING EVERY RACE, RELIGION AND CREED OF CORRESPONDENT UNDER THE SUN -- INDIAN, BRITTS, BLACKS, TWO  CANADIANS -- THEN WHEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC NUMBERS BECOME COMPLETELY UNAVOIDABLE, YOU HOPE  TO MAKE UP FOR IT BY GOOGLING "MEXICAN COMEDIAN" AND VOILA. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT WOULD BE QUITE A CYNICAL MOVE.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE, AND BY THE WAY, I AM A LITTLE OFFENDED  THAT YOUR MAKE-UP LADY COVERED UP MY TEARDROP TATTOO.
Jon: I'M SURE SHE WASN'T TRYING TO... DOESN'T THAT MEAN, THAT TEARDROP TATTOO MEANS YOU KILLED SOMEBODY.
ONLY ON THE RIGHT EYE. ON THE LEFT SIDE IT MEANS I TRIED TO KILL SOMEONE BUT THEY GOT AWAY. I'M REALLY SAD ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OBAMA'S PLAN, AL, DOES SOUND PRETTY REASONABLE. YOU GET CAUGHT HERE ILLEGALLY, YOU PAY A FINE, YOU LEARN ENGLISH, YOU HEAD TO THE BACK OF THE LINE FOR CITIZENSHIP.
OR AS SOME PEOPLE LIKE THE CALL IT...
EXPLICIT AMNESTY.
A WAY OF SAYING AMNESTY.
AMNESTY OF UP TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE.
PAYING THE PRICE FAR CRIME YOU'VE COMMITTED ISN'T AMNESTY.
Jon: BUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE STILL COMMITTING A CRIME.
OR IS IT ENTRAPMENT? AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL, PURPLE MOUNTAINS MAJESTY? THIS PLACE HAS GOT IT ALL. MEXICANS CAN SEE LAS VEGAS FROM THEIR CASAS, JON. HMM, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I CAN GET BEHEADED ON THIS SIDE OF A BORDER FOR DRIVING DOWN A STREET CONTROLLED BY SOME  SCARFACE WANNABE, OR I CAN GO OVER TO THE SHINY PLACE WHERE BIG BOOB BLONDE GIRLS IN DOLPHIN  SHORTS SERVE ME COCKTAILS WHILE I PLAY BLACKJACK. HIT ME.
Jon: I GUESS WE MAKE IT KIND OF HARD NOT TO COME HERE.
YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF IT, TOO.
Jon: LIKE A CHEAP LABOR FORCE?
AND SELF-ESTEEM. UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AREN'T JUST TAKING THE JOBS YOU DON'T WANT  TO DO, THEY'RE TAKING THE STAIR TYPES YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED, LIKE LAZY.
Jon: AL, EVERYBODY CALLS AMERICANS LAZY.
YEAH, BUT THE GOOD KIND OF LAZY, RICH LAZY, SPREAD OUT ON A  LEATHER COUCH WATCHING "THE PRICE IS RIGHT" WHILE THE ROOMBA VACUUMS YOUR ROOM. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LATINO LAZY, NO ES BUENO, JON.
Jon: DON'T YOU RESENT THOSE MISCONCEPTIONS?
OF COURSE, JUST LIKE YOU REDISENGTDING PEOPLE WHO THINK JEWS CONTROL THE MEDIA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE MEDIA.
WAIT, NOT THE MEDIAN, THE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD?
Jon: WE DON'T CONTROL THE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. PEOPLE SAY WE CONTROL THE MEDIA, NOT THE MEDIANS.
OH, WOW. SO WE CAN SELL ORANGES WHEREVER WE WANT. HEY, GUYS, HE SAID IT'S COOL.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, AL. AL MADRIGAL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
