SO LAST FRIDAY THE FINAL LAUNCH OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS LAST FRIDAY, A STIRRING EVENT THAT  CREATED EVEN MORE UNEMPLOYMENT WITH SWARMS OF JOBLESS ASTRONAUTS NOW FLOODING THE JOB MARKET. JOHN OLIVER WAS AT CAPE CANAVERAL TO WITNESS THE END OF AN ERA.
AMERICA'S SPACE PROGRAM WAS OUR CROWNING GLORY. IT WAS A MEASURE OF WHO WE WERE AS A PEOPLE, A TIME WHEN WE EXPLORED A NEW WORLD, ILLUMINATED OUR BREATHTAKING UNIVERSE, AND WE DID THESE THINGS IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF  JOHN F. KENDY...
NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD.
ALL OF THIS IS NOW OVER. AND WHERE BETTER FOR ME TO GO THAN FLORIDA TO WATCH SOMETHING DIE.
IT'S A LITTLE SAD. THIS IS REALLY THE END OF AN ERA.
HAPPY THAT I GOT TO SEE IT. SAD THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE NONE AFTER THIS.
TOO BAD I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT AGAIN.
IT WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US IN A WAY.
WILL IT?
NO, NOT THE SHUTTLE. THAT WILL PROBABLY GET MELTED DOWN FOR SCRAP. I MEAN THE MEMORY OF WHEN AMERICA HAD HOPES AND DREAMS. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? DON'T SAY ASTRONAUT. [LAUGHTER] WERE YOU GOING TO SAY ASTRONAUT?
YEAH.
I COULD SEE THAT. AMERICA'S SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM WAS IN ITS FINAL COUNTDOWN. AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO BE A PART OF IT. I'M HERE AT CAPE CA KNAVE RAL FOR A SEMINOLE MOMENT IN HISTORY WHEN AMERICA LOOKS TO ITS  HIGHEST ASPIRATIONS AND SAID, EH, [BLEEPED] IT. THE SPACE PROGRAM HAD ONCE BEEN PILOTED BY MEN WHO WERE INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTARS, NAMES  LIKE JOHN GLENN, NEIL ARMSTRONG, JIM LOVELL.
HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
APPARENTLY THEY EVEN EXISTED IN REAL LIFE, TOO. I SAT DOWN WITH APOLLO 13'S JIM LOVELL, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO, WHO WOULD NEVER GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT. THIS CONVERSATION WASN'T GOING TO BE EASY.
I'M JUST GOING TO STOP THAT MUSIC. RIGHT. IT'S GOING TO MAKE THIS MORE DIFFICULT. SO, JIM, LISTEN, IT'S OVER.
I NEVER SAY THAT. IT IS MUCH EASIER IF WE JUST SAID, WHY DON'T WE LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. INDIA IS LOOKING AT THE ADVANTAGES OF SPACE.
SO WE'RE GOING TO OUTSOURCE OUR HOPES AND DREAMS TO INDIA.
WE MIGHT. BUT IS THAT THE MODUS OPERANDI OF THE UNITED STATES? NO. THE NEW GENERATION SHOULD GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT THE OLD GENERATION GOT. WE ORBITED THE MOON FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. WE SAW THE EARTH AS IT REALLY IS, JUST A SMALL BLUE AND WHITE BODY TUCKED AWAY IN THE VASTNESS  OF SPACE. I COULD PUT UP MY THUMB AND COMPLETELY HIDE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN. THAT PHOTOGRAPH TELLS IN JUST ONE PICTURE REALLY THE EXISTENCE THAT WE HAVE HERE ON EARTH.
WOW. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. I'VE ACTUALLY GOT AN AMAZING PHOTOGRAPH, AS WELL. I GOT TO SHOW YOU. LOOK, IT'S ME AND PEE WEE HERMAN. [LAUGHTER]
OH, YEAH.
ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE? DO -- YOU THINK, I CAN'T BEREAVE WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW. AS THE SHUTTLE PREPARED FOR ITS LAST LAUNCH AND THE CROWD BRACED THEMSELVES FOR A FINAL WAVE  GOOD-BYE, THIS AMERICAN ICON LEFT THE EARTH, NOT WITH A BANG, BUT WITH A WHOA, WOW, HOLY CRAP THAT IS LOUD, WOW. LOOK AT THAT THING. I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, A WEEK AFTER THIS HAPPENED I'M STILL GETTING GOOSE BUMPS. WOW THAT. IS THE SINGLE MOST AMAZING THING I'VE EVER WITNESSED. GO, GO, FLY! WE HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN. WHEN ARE WE DOING THAT AGAIN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN NEVER? OKAY. SO THAT WAS OBJECTIVELY INCREDIBLE. BUT WHO IS GOING TO CONVINCE AMERICA THAT THIS IS STILL WORTH DOING?
JOHN, PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN GOALS, CERTAIN THINGS TO  STRIVE FOR, THINGS THEY CAN LOOK UP TO AND SAY, HEY, IT DID THAT. TO GIVE UP ON THAT CREAM -- DREAM IS TO GIVE UP ON AMERICA.
YEAH, I GUESS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME JUST TRY SOMETHING A BIT BETTER. OKAY. SO YOU GO.
ALL PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE CERTAIN GOALS, SOMETHING TO STRIVE FOR, AND IN DOING SO, WE  REACHED BEYOND OURSELVES TO ACHIEVE THAT WHICH WE DID NOT THINK WAS POSSIBLE, TO GIVE UP  ON THAT DREAM IS TO GIVE UP ON AMERICA.
IT WAS BETTER.
I THINK IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
I KNOW, DO FORRSET GUMP.
I DON'T TAKE REQUESTS.
