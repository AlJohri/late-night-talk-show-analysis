(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", THE  VERY FUNNY JASON SUDEIKIS IS  GOING TO BE JOINING US LATER. IT WAS JUST ONE WEEK AGO TONIGHT  THAT BARACK OBAMA WON REELECTION  TO THE PRESIDENCY ENDING A HEATED POLITICAL CAMPAIGN AND  HOPEFULLY SETTING THE STAGE FOR  THE HEALING THAT THIS COUNTRY SO DESPERATELY NEEDS.
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS RECEIVED  ONLINE PETITIONS FROM NOT SO  PROUD AMERICANS IN 20 STATES WHO WOULD LIKE TO SECEDE FROM THE  UNION. (LAUGHTER)  WAIT! I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHICH 20  STATES THOSE ARE OR WHICH PEOPLE  IN THOSE 20 STATE BUS I THINK I CAN BEST EXPRESS HOW I FEEL  ABOUT THESE STATES AND PEOPLE IN  THE WORD OF THE GREAT WILLIAM  WONKA.
(FLATLY)  STOP, DON'T, COME BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AT LEAST NOW I'M  BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHY  SOUTHERN STATES WERE SO HESITANT TO GET RID OF THE CONFEDERATE  FLAG. IT'S LIKE KEEPING YOUR FAT PANTS  AFTER YOU LOSE SOME WEIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'RE HAPPY FOR NOW WITH THE  NEW YOU BUT PRETTY SOON YOU'RE  GOING TO NEED THOSE FAT PANTS  AGAIN. THERE'S PIZZA IN STATEN ISLAND  AND -- I'M NOT SURPRISED. WE WERE WARNED REELECT THAT  OBAMA WOULD HAVE DIRE  CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR UNION, FOR OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD, AND  RETAIL!
WEST GATE RESORT C.E.O. DAVID  SIEGEL E-MAILED HIS EMPLOYEES  AND SAID HE WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FIRE PEOPLE IF PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS REELECTED AND HIS  PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES GO UP. ROBERT MURRAY, C.E.O. OF MURRAY  ENERGY SENT A LETTER TO HIS  EMPLOYEES HECTORING THEM TO DONATE TO THE COMPANY'S  POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE  TELLING THEM IF THEY DID NOT "THE COAL INDUSTRY WILL BE  ELIMINATED AND SO WILL YOUR  JOBS."
Jon: WELL, GUESS WHAT? THOSE PEOPLE WERE RIGHT. DESPITE NO OBJECTIVE CHANGE IN  WHO'S RUNNING THE COUNTRY OR THE  SITUATION THE COUNTRY IS IN, C.E.O.s ARE TAKING ACTION. LIKE COAL MAGNATE ROBERT MURRAY  WHO SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO FIRE  PEOPLE IF OBAMA WON AND THEN FIRED PEOPLE WHILE THEY WERE  STILL COUNTING FLORIDA. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT? (LAUGHTER)  A PROPHECY FULFILLED BY THE  PROFESSOR SEER. LIKE A WEATHER MAN FORECASTING  SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THEN  RUNNING UP ON THE ROOF AND PEEING ON PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)  "YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T CALL FOR  HAIL!"  (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THEY LEFT ME NO CHOICE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE REDUCED  ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AMERICA. WE'RE GOING TO SEE REDUCED  ELECTRIC POWER CONSUMPTION. WE'RE GOING TO SEE DRASTICALLY  REDUCED COAL MARKETS.
Jon: A GREEDY BLACK-HEARTED  MAN WHO OWNS A COAL MINE. WELL, NOW I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IT'S NOT JUST THOSE WHO  PROVIDE COMPRESSED LUMPS OF DEAD  ANIMALS TO FUEL YOUR HOME WHO ARE AFFECTED. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S ALSO THOSE WHO PROVIDE  COMPRESSED LUMPS OF DEAD ANIMALS  TO FUEL YOUR BODY.
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS HE MIGHT  HAVE TO MOVE SOME OF HIS  EMPLOYEES FROM FULL TIME TO PART TIME IF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA  GETS REELECTED. JOINING US NOW IS ZANE TANKEL,  HE RUNS I THINK 42 APPLEBEE'S  FRANCHISES.
Jon: I'M GOING TO STOP YOU  RIGHT THERE. ZANE TANKEL? (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S WHO YOU WANT ME TO  ACCEPT? ZANE TANKEL? NO. NO. (APPLAUSE)  ZANE TANKEL DOES NOT RUN AN  APPLEBEE'S. ZANE TANKEL IS AN INTERGALACTIC  BOUNTY HUNTER WHO GETS IN FIGHT  WITH BUCK ROGERS. (LAUGHTER)  I'M SORRY, RESUME YOUR INTERVIEW  WITH ZANE TANKEL.
WE WON'T BUILD MORE  RESTAURANTS. WE WON'T HIRE MORE PEOPLE.
YOU RUN AN APPLEBEE'S. (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S A COST-CUTTING IDEA. DON'T SERVE YOUR DOUBLE-BARREL  WHISKEY FRIED CREAMY STEAK AND  CHIMICHANGA SLIDERS IN TROUGHS. (LAUGHTER)  NOT ONLY SHOULD YOU PROVIDE YOUR  EMPLOYEES HEALTH CARE, YOU  SHOULD BE PERSONALLY APOLOGIZING TO OUR NATION'S PHYSICIANS. (LAUGHTER)  ANYBODY ELSE GOT A PROBLEM WITH  IT?
PAPA JOHN'S C.E.O. SAYS THE  COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REDUCE  WORKER HOURS TO SAVE MONEY ON HEALTH CARE.
Jon: NO, NOT A PAPA JOHN'S! (LAUGHTER)  ANYBODY BUT A PAPA JOHN'S! I'D WRATHER THE PAPARAZZI OR THE  PA P.A. PA SMEAR. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?
THE C.E.O. SAYS OBAMACARE  WILL COST THEIR CHAIN UP TO $8  MILLION A YEAR AND COULD FORCE IT TO CUT EMPLOYEE HOURS.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT  NOTHING. THEY ARE A $3 BILLION A YEAR  BUSINESS FOR CORPORATE AND  FRANCHISEES BUT YOU HAVE TO FIND THAT $8 MILLION SOMEWHERE AND  IT'S NOT NOTHING. OKAY, LET ME JUST -- I  APOLOGIZE. PIE IS $10, I THINK, AT PAPA  JOHN'S. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF LIKE A  MILLION PIZZAS. WHERE ARE ARE YOU KWROEUPBGGOING  FIND A MILLION PIZZAS?
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO  KICK OFF THIS SEASON?
ONE MILLION FREE PIZZA'S FROM  PAPA JOHN'S.
ALL SEASON LONG PAPA JOHN'S  HAVE TWO MILLION FREE PIZZAS. >>PIZZAS.
Jon: I JUST HAVE NO  (BLEEP)ING IDEA HOW THEY'RE  GOING TO DO THIS. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, I KNOW, JOB CREATORS, SEE  ME AT CAMERA THREE. THANKS FOR JOINING ME, I KNOW  YOU'VE GOT A BUSY SCHEDULE JOB  CREATING AND THE BOOTSTRAP PULLING AND ALL SO I'LL KEEP  THIS BRIEF OR I'LL PROACTIVELY  DOWNSIZE THE TIME SPAN INTENSITY OF OUR DIALOGUE VIS-A-VIS --  WHATEVER. ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  GUYS I GET IT, PROVIDING HEALTH  CARE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES COST  MONEY AND AS A GROUP YOU TEND TO PREFER THINGS THAT DO NOT COST  THAT. (LAUGHTER)  I WATCH "UNDERCOVER BOSS."  (LAUGHTER)  BUT OWN YOUR LAYOFFS AND YOUR  POLICIES. LET'S STOP PRETENDING THAT  SUDDENLY THIS ELECTION BOSSES  HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO RELUCTANT AS (BLEEP)S. (LAUGHTER)  OBAMACARE IS JUST THE LATEST  EXCUSE TO WRIGGLE OUT OF THE  SOCIAL CONTRACT. FOR MANY YEARS FULL TIME  BENEFITS LIKE SICK DAYS MARX  TERNTY LEAVE, PENSIONS, LUNCH HOURS, CHAIRS, HAVE DISAPPEARED  BY MAGICALLY TRANSFORMING  FULL-TIME WORKERS INTO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR  PART-TIME 20-YEAR TEMP HELP. (LAUGHTER)  WANT TO AVOID PAYING HALF OF  YOUR EMPLOYEES' SOCIAL SECURITY  TAX? RECLASSIFY THEM AS INDEPENDENT  CONTRACTORS SO THEY PAY IT ALL  THEMSELVES. MAKE THEM FILL OUT A 1099. THAT'S NOT A FULL-TIME BUSBOY,  THAT'S JUAN CO, L.L.C . DON'T  FORGET TO INVOICE US, JUAN CO. (LAUGHTER)  SO LET'S CUT THE "I'D LOVE TO BE  ABLE TO GIVE EMPLOYEES HEALTH  CARE, I JUST CAN'T." LET'S FACE THE FACTS. PIZZA AND COAL COMPANIES ARE  JUST UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A  LABOR FORCE THAT CAN'T BE  OUTSOURCEED. YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN ONE OF THE  FEW INDUSTRIES THAT STILL HAS TO  HIRE AMERICANS. IF YOU COULD OUTSOURCE YOUR  PIZZA MAKING TO CHINA PAPA  JOHN'S WOULD QUICKLY BECOME  PAPA-SAN. WHICH IS ACTUALLY JAPAN. BUT, YOU KNOW, FOR THE JOKE YOU  UNDERSTAND. IT'S YOUR FAULT! YOU COULD HAVE GONE TECH, PAPA  JOHN. FOUNDED INSTAGRAM AND MADE A  BILLION DOLLARS. INSTEAD YOU MADE PIZZAS WITH A  FILTER THAT MAKES THEM TASTE  LIKE IT'S 1979. (LAUGHTER)  AND MURRAY WITH THE COAL  COMPANY. DON'T PRETEND YOU'RE NOT GOING  TO FIRE ALL YOUR HUMAN COAL  MINERS THE MINUTE YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRAIN BATS TO CARRY COAL  LUMPS UP OUT OF THE GROUND. NOT THAT YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE A  LEGITIMATE GRIPE AGAINST THIS  PRESIDENT. OBAMA HAS FOUGHT HARDER FOR  SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CARE  BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER  PREMIUM IN YOUR LIVES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU COULD STUFF YOUR PIZZA CRUST  WITH MONEY AND STILL SELL THEM FOR $10 AND IF OBAMA BANNED  NATURAL GAS FRACKING THEN COAL  WOULDN'T BE GETTING ITS ASS KICKED IN THE -- WHAT'S IT  CALLED, AGAIN? FREE MARKET. (LAUGHTER)  SO MAYBE NEXT TIME TAKE ALL THE  MILLIONS YOU DONATED FOR  PARTISAN POLITICAL PURPOSES AND PUMP IT BACK INTO THE TYPE OF  HEALTH CARE ADVANCES THAT MAY  ULTIMATELY INCREASE BUSINESS  PRODUCTIVITY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AND THEN WE CAN JUST FINALLY  KEEP PIZZA OUT OF POLITICS. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE AT A CERTAIN POINT IT'S  GOING TO MAKE CHILDREN'S PARTIES  VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
HEY, CITIZENS! YOU MUST RESIST THE PRESIDENCY  OF BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA. SEND HIM BACK TO KENYA! SHOW YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND  PLAY FOR FREE!
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
