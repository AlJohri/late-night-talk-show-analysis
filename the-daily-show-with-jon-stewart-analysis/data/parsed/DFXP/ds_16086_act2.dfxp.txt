( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, THE SUPREME COURT'S TERM ENDED WITH A RASH OF NEW RULINGS.
THE COURT STRUCK DOWN A LAW PASSED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN 2005 AND SIGNED  INTO LAW BY THEN-GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER THAT MADE A CRIME TO SELL OR RENT VIDEO GAMES  DEPICTING VIOLENCE TO ANYONE UNDER 18.
Jon: OH, WOW. THAT'S GOT TO BE A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SCHWARZENEGGER. A MAN WHO FOUGHT SO HARD FOR SO LONG TO PROTECT KIDS FROM IMAGES OF GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE. ( LAUGHTER ) THE STATE HAS NO PLACE KEEPING KIDS FROM BUYING VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES. BIG DEAL. YOU KNOW WHAT? I AGREE WITH THAT. I USED TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES, SPACE INVADERS, DOOM. HOW BAD COULD THE GAMES REALLY BEE-- OH, MY GOD! OH! OH ( BLEEP )! OH, MY GOD! I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK! OH! OH! THAT ( BLEEP )! OH, GET SOME ICE! ( LAUGHTER ) CAN THE STATES PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON CONTENT SOLD TO MINORS?
JUSTICE SLAE IN HIS OPINION-- SALEA SAID GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESTRICT SEXUAL  MATERIALS BUT NOT VIOLENT AND OTHER MATERIALS.
OH. WHAT? SO I GUESS THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR TODAY'S GRAPHICALLY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES. BAD NEWS FOR SEXY GAMING CLASSICS LIKE SUPER MARIO BONERS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( LAUGHTER ) NICE JOB, SAM. LET'S BE CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. FAIR WARNING. THIS IS REALLY FAIR WARNING. YOU MAY FIND THIS NEXT CLIP-- IN FACT I'D BE TRULY SURPRISE FUD  DON'T, IN ALL SHEERSNESS-- SHOCKING AND OFFENSIVE. IT'S LIKE AN INTERACTIVE, ANIMATED SNUFF FILM. IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO VIOLENT IMAGERY NOW MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME TO GO TO ANOTHER ROOM AND HAVE  FILTHY, DISGUSTING DEVIANT SEX. IN THIS CASE BROWN VERSUS ENTERTAINMENT, THE SUPREME COURT DETERMINED 7-2, THAT THE STATE  OF CALIFORNIA HAS NO INTEREST IN RESTRICTING THE SALE OF THIS GAME-- NO INTEREST IN  RESTRICTING THE SALES OF THAT GAME TO CHILDREN. BUT, IF WHILE BEING DISEMBOWELED THIS WOMAN WERE TO SUFFER PERHAPS A NIP SLIP, REGULATE AWAY. PERSONALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF VIDEO GAME VIOLENCE AFFECTS CHILDREN BUT I AM WORRIED THAT  THE GAMES ARE AFFECTING JUDGES THAT HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM, LIKE IN THE-- IN THE WISCONSIN  SUPREME COURT...
JUST ANNE WALSH BRADLEY IS ACCUSING FELLOW JUSTICE DAVID PROCTOR OF TRYING TO CHOKE HER  DURING A HEATED DEBATE. PROFFER DENIES IT.
WHAT JUSTICE BRADLEY SAYS IS SHE ASKED JUSTICE DAVID PROFFER TO LEAVE. HE PUT HER NECK IN A CHOKE HOLD.
Jon: JUDGES FIGHTING EACH OTHER. SOUND LOOK A CASE FOR MY NEW SHOW "COURT, COURT." LITERALLY, A BENCH-CLEARING  BRAWL HAPPENING IN THE MIDST OF OF AN IDEOLOGICALLY CHARGED DEBATE OVER COLLECTIVE  BARGAINING RIGHTS. IT'S THE BIGGEST POLITICAL FIGHT IN RECEIPT WISCONSIN HISTORY BUT IT'S HE SAID/SHE SAID. HOW DO WE EVER KNOW WHO IS RIGHT? THE ALTERCATION ALLEGEDLY TOOK PLACE IN FRONT OF THEIR COURT COLLEAGUES.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. THANK GOD. EYEWITNESSES. AND NOT JUST ANY EYEWITNESSES. THE OTHER SUPREME COURT JUSTICES PILLARS OF THE WISCONSIN LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT, THE VERY PEOPLE  ENTRUSTED WITH THE SOLID JUDICIAL DUTY OF WEIGHING FACT AND DETERMINING JUSTICE.
AND THEY, TOO, ARE DIVIDE OVER EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: THE OTHER JUSTICES WERE THERE AND THEY'RE STILL-- LET ME GUESS, PARTY LINES. THEY'RE DIVIDED ON PARTY LINES. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHOSE JOB IS INTERPRETING WHAT A DWRUM GROUP OF DEAD FOUNDERS WERE THINKING  AND THEY'RE CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR ( BLEEP ) EYES. ( LAUGHTER ) I USED TO THINK YOUR REALITY SHAPED YOUR POLITICS. IT'S CLEAR NOW, YOUR POLITICS SHAPES REALITY. WE'LL BE RIGHT B
