FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, AN OLD FAVORITE, MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL IS GOING TO BE HERE DISCUSSING HER NEW MINISERIES, "THE HONOURABLE WOMAN," ABOUT ONE PERSON'S ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN -- OH, FOR GOD'S... ISRAEL AND PALESTINE? OH, MAN, CAN A BROTHER GATE BATMAN SEQUEL? I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE. [LAUGHTER] I JUST, I JUST NEED A DAY OFF. THAT'S ALL I NEED. AND THE AUDIENCE WANTS ME TO SOLVE IT. AND THE [MUMBLING]... WHAT DO YOU, WOULD YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST [BLEEPED] SAID THAT. I JUST WANTED SOME PIZZA. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? [LAUGHTER] BUT TONIGHT I'D LIKE THE TALK TO YOU ABOUT CORPORATIONS. CORPORATIONS, THEY'RE A LOT LIKE US -- IMMORTAL. [LAUGHTER] SHIELDED FROM LIABILITY, ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO SHAREHOLDERS. OH, WAIT, THAT'S OPPOSITE OF US. SORRY. BUT THERE IS ONE THING CORPORATIONS DO HAVE IN COMMON WITH THE REST OF US. THEY DON'T LIKE PAYING TAXES. HATE IT. FORTUNATELY, THEY RARELY HAVE TO. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S -- OH, THAT'S NOT, NO. THAT'S... I DON'T. I DON'T... I DID NOT... I DID NOT APPROVE THIS, AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS DISRESPECTFUL IN SOME WAYS. IT'S ABOUT INVESTIGATING... OKAY. THAT I DON'T... THAT I DON'T.  LET'S GO WITH THE FIRST ONE, AND THEN WE'LL JUST... OKAY. THAT'S FINE. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THIS SEASON'S HOT NEW TAX LOOPHOLE FOR CORPORATIONS, A ONCE-OBSCURE TAX DODGE KNOWN AS THE CORPORATE INVERSION, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THE BUSINESS EQUIVALENT OF GENDER REASSIGNMENT, AND IT KIND OF IS. IT'S A LIBERATING PROCEDURE FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AMERICAN BUT KNOW IN THEIR HEARTS THEY'RE REALLY IRISH.
TAX INVERSIONS, THAT'S WHERE COMPANIES REINCORPORATE OVERSEAS SIMPLY TO CUT THEIR U.S. TAX BILLS.
ACCOMPANIED BY THE FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY AND THEN THROUGH THE MAGIC OF PAPERWORK PROCLAIMS ITSELF TO BE A FOREIGN COMPANY AND OWNED BY THE SUBSIDIARY.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY, YOU'RE AN AMERICAN COMPANY. AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE AN IRISH COMPANY.
Jon: OH SO IT'S LIKE ST. PATRICK'S DAY FOR CORPORATIONS. [LAUGHTER] EXCEPT INSTEAD OF BEER, THEY VOMIT PROFIT. CORPORATE INVERSION IS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYONE. AND BY "EVERYONE," I MEAN ONLY THE CORPORATIONS AND THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. CONGRESS ESTIMATES THAT INVERSIONS WILL COST THE TREASURY $19.5 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS, BUT FORTUNE MAGAZINE BELIEVES THAT THAT ESTIMATE IS WAY LOW BECAUSE "FORTUNE" MAGAZINE IS A COMMUNIST RAG. [LAUGHTER] HOW DO WE STOP INVERSION?
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL SUPPORT ANTI-INVERSION LEGISLATION. THE LEGISLATION WOULD MANDATE THAT COMPANIES MUST BE MORE THAN 50% OWNED BY A FOREIGN ENTITY TO ESCAPE U.S. TAXES.
Jon: WELL, THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE, AND IF PRESIDENT OBAMA IS BACKING THAT LAW, IT'S PROBABLY A DONE DEAL. [LAUGHTER] JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, THOUGH, FOR GIGGLES HERE, WHERE DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STAND?
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATE IN THE WORLD.
OUR TAX CODE, WHICH IS WHAT'S CAUSING A LOT OF THESE INVERSIONS...
IN A WAY THESE COMPANIES ARE ECONOMIC REFUGEES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OH, WELL IF THEY'RE REFUGEES, WHY DON'T WE JUST STICK TO OUR NORMAL POLICY AND SEND THEM BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM. OH, WAIT, THAT'S HERE! [LAUGHTER] BUT OBVIOUSLY BESTOWING REFUGEE STATUS ON MULTIBILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS ATTEMPTING TO MAXIMIZE PROFIT THROUGH GLOBALIZED TAX EVASION IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. LET'S MEET ONE OF THESE POOR CORPORATE WAIFS, PENNSYLVANIA'S MYLAN PHARMACEUTICAL. NO, THAT'S AN ACTUAL REFUGEE. ACTUALLY, THAT'S, WELL YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S REFUGEE UP THE LOGO A LITTLE BIT AND THEN WE CAN... OKAY. GREAT. THAT'S NICE. WHERE IS THIS POOR CORPORATION SEEKING ASYLUM?
THIS MONTH MYLAN ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD INCORPORATE IN THE NETHERLANDS AS PART OF A TAX INVERSION DEAL.
Jon: POOR, GENERIC DRUG COMPANY. LIFE WAS SO BAD FOR MYLAN IN THE U.S. THAT IT DECIDED TO GO FROM PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH TO JUST PLAIN DUTCH. [LAUGHTER] WELL, HERE ARE SOME OF THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS THAT MYLAN FACED IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OPPRESSIVE TAX CREDITS FOR THINGS LIKE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, FOR THINGS LIKE INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION, FOR THINGS LIKE MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT, FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, FOR SOMETHING CALLED "STRATEGIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT." WHICH IS APPARENTLY A WHOLE [BLEEPED] DIFFERENT THING THAN REGULAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROOM. SUPER CREDITS AGAINST BUSINESS FRANCHISE TAXES, SUPER CREDITS AGAINST CORPORATE NET TAXES, EVEN A TAX CREDIT FOR REHABILITATING AN HISTORIC BUILDING. YES, TAXPAYERS GAVE A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR GENERIC BONER PILL COMPANY MONEY TO ARTIFICIALLY PROP UP AN AGING STRUCTURE LONG PAST THE POINT THAT NATURE MEANT FOR IT TO COLLAPSE TO RUBBLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, IF THAT BUILDING STANDS FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS, YOU MAY WANT TO, YOU MAY WANT TO CALL YOUR ARCHITECT. [LAUGHTER] BUT ALONG WITH TAX CREDITS, THE OPPRESSIVE AMERICAN REGIME ALSO FORCED MYLAN TO ACCEPT $3 BILLION IN SALES FROM JUST THE V.A. SINCE 2009, ALTHOUGH SINCE IT'S THE V.A., I ASSUME THOSE WERE FOR AILMENTS FROM THE '90s. NOW, WE KNOW HOW CONSERVATIVES FEEL ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THEY'RE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO.
REMEMBER THE SURFER DUDE, LIVES ON FOOD STAMPS, USES YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO EAT LOBSTER.
THIS GUY IS A PARASITE.
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A SYSTEM DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD. AND I WONDER WHERE HIS PARENTS ARE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I BELIEVE IT'S THE NETHERLANDS. [LAUGHTER] WELL, ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TAKE TOO MUCH ADVANTAGE OF ENTITLEMENTS, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT CORPORATIONS WHO ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE AND THROUGH MORALLY DUBIOUS YET ENTIRELY LEGAL MEANS [BLEEPED] OVER THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WHILE STILL ENJOYING ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY BENEFITS SAID GOVERNMENT PROVIDES?
THE COMPANY IS MORE COMPETITIVE WHEN IT PUTS ITS LEGAL HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS.
IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR THEM TO PAY A HIGHER TAX BILL IF THEY CAN AVOID IT.
THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.
ABBOTT LAB C.E.O. MILES WHITE SAYS ESSENTIALLY THIS IS LEGAL. KUDOS TO HIM FOR STANDING UP AS A C.E.O. AND TAKING A STAND. YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE THAT.
Jon: OH, KUDOS. YOU SO RARELY SEE FIDUCH-BAGS LIKE THAT DEFENDING THE POLICIES THAT MAKE THEIR COMPANIES PROFITABLE. IT'S LIKE SEEING A UNICORN, STUPID UNICORNS, ALWAYS EATING YOUR GARBAGE AT NIGHT, SCURRYING ALL OVER THE SUBWAY, SPREADING DISEASE AND PESTILENCE. I MEAN, THAT'S... I'M SORRY. I'M BEING TOLD I'M BEING TOLD I'M THINKING OF RATS. THAT'S RATS. I ALWAYS CONFUSE RATS WITH UNICORNS. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS SUCH A DISASTER. [LAUGHTER] WOW, WOW, LOOK AT MY LEAN BODY. DRESSED IN MY TRADEMARK JEANS. WHEN DOES THIS END? WHEN, I SAY, GETTING BACK TO THE BIT? WE ARE CONSTANTLY GIVING IN TO EVERY DEMAND AND WHIM OF CORPORATIONS. AND YET THEY'RE STILL NOT SATISFIED. THEY'LL NEVER BE SATISFIED. MYLAN WAS PAYING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE UNITED STATES OF 16.2% IN 2013. RATHER THAN THE 35% CORPORATE TAX RATE THAT THERE IS. THEY WERE ENJOYING ENORMOUS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, THE BENEFITS OF OUR NIH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH. THEY JUST WANT AND WANT AND WANT WITH NO CONCERN -- WAIT A MINUTE. WHEN WAS THE CITIZENS UNITED DECISION. THAT WAS 2010, RIGHT? THAT EXPLAINS IT. CORPORATIONS HAVE ONLY BEEN PEOPLE FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS. [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE TODDLERS. AND BY GIVING IN EVERY TIME THEY THROW A TANTRUM AND THREATEN TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME, WE'RE SPOILING THESE BASTARDS. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, THESE CORPORATIONS WILL GROW UP FERAL AND TURN INTO SOMETHING EVEN WORSE. YEAH. IF WE DON'T START TELLING CORPORATIONS NO, THEY'RE GOING TO JUST END UP PEEING IN BUCKETS AND TRYING TO SNEAK MONKEYS INTO GERMANY. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TELL CORPORATIONS, IF YOU WANT TO LIVE UNDER OUR ROOF, YOU PLAY BY OUR RULES, SO, NO, MYLAN, YOU CAN'T GO TO HOLLAND. YOU'RE GROUNDED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
