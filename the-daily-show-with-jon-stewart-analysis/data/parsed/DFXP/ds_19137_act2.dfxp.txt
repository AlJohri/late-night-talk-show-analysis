Jon: WELCOME BACK. FOLKS WE ALL KNOW VIDEO KILLED THE RADIOSTAR. ASK YOUR PARENTS. [LAUGHTER] BUT HAS THE INTERNET KILLED NEWSPAPERS? YES! OR HAS IT? JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
THE PEOPLE OF ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN, USED TO HAVE A LOT OF LOCAL NEWSPAPERS TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT NOW ALL OF THEM HAVE CLOSED UP SHOP OR MOVED ONLINE, ALL EXCEPT ONE, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN STUDENT-RUN DAILY. I WENT TO THEIR NEWS ROOM TO SEE IF THEY HAD WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK JOURNALISM IS?
IT MUST BE WELL RESEARCHED.
INFORMATIVE.
JOURNALISM IS THE ABILITY TO TELL A STORY IN A WAY THAT EMPOWERS PEOPLE.
IS THIS WHAT THEY'RE TEACHING YOU HERE?
UH-HUH.
OH, WE ARE SO [BLEEPED]. THEY WERE GOING TO GET CRUSHED. SEE, KIDS, THE MODERN WORLD OF JOURNALISM IS DOMINATED BY AGGREGATORS LIKE THESE, THE ONES THAT KILLED TRADITIONAL PAPERS. TODAY MEN LIKE FORMER GAWKER EDITOR NEETZAN ZIMMERMAN HAVE REDEFINED NEWS.
IF A PERSON IS NOT SHARING A NEWS STORY, IT IS, AT IT'S CORE, NOT NEWS.
WHAT ADVICE WOULD GIVE COLLEGE STUDENTS STUDYING TO BE JOURNALISTS.
I'D SAY DON'T BOTHER UNLESS YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO CRAFT THE PERFECT STORY FOR THE VIRAL WEB, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GETTING MUCH OUT OF THAT EDUCATION.
REALLY?
YES. NOWADAYS IT'S NOT IMPORTANT IF A STORY IS REAL. THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHETHER PEOPLE CLICK ON IT.
YOU GOT THAT, KIDS? OKAY, PROFESSOR NEETZAN, TIME FOR JOURNALISM 101.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS HAVING A GOOD HEADLINE. USUALLY YOU'LL START WITH A QUESTION WORD. YOUR WHAT'S, YOUR WHO'S, YOUR WHERE'S.
MAYBE A HOW?
YEAH. THEN WORDS THAT CAUSE A PERSON TO STOP AND PAY ATTENTION, SO YOU'LL USE A THIS OR A THAT.
WHAT THIS? WHO THAT?
EXACTLY.
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE DO YOU WRITE A GOOD HEADLINE.
MAYBE 15 MINUTES.
JUST SITTING THERE FOR 15 MINUTES COMING UP WITH THAT HEADLINE AND THEN MOVING ON.
WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE REST OF THE ARTICLE.
HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE?
MAYBE FIVE MINUTES.
TIME TO SEE IF THESE CUB REPORTERS HAVE THEIR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT.
HEAR THIS SOUND? THAT'S THE SOUND OF PEOPLE LIKING THE THINGS YOU PUT ONLINE. READ ME SOME OF YOUR HEADLINES.
ACCLAIMED INDY FILMMAKER DONATES WORK TO UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES.
NEXT.
NEW GROCERY STORE TO REPLACE KROGER ON SOUTH INDUSTRIAL.
MEET THE MAN WITH NO ASS CRACK. SNEAKY BEAGLE HITS UP CHICKEN NUGGETS WHILE OWNER IS AWAY.
LOVE IT.
SORORITY GIRL GETS BACK AT TWO-TIMING BOYFRIEND BY [BLEEPED] IN HIS BED.
IMPRESSIVE, BUT HE COULD HELP THIS NEWS ROOM OF FULL OF KIDS DETERMINED TO WRITE ARTICLES THAT MATTER. WELL, LISTEN TO THE ADVICE HE HAD FOR THIS KID ON HOW TO SPICE UP A BORING STORY ABOUT GROUND-BREAKING ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH.
ALWAYS LEAD WITH SEX IF YOU CAN.
ARE WE GOING TO TOUCH ON ALZHEIMER'S THING?
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS BRING PEOPLE IN WITH THE BOOBS AND THE SIDE-BOOB BUT THEN HAVE THEM STICK AROUND FOR THE MORE SERIOUSLY, HARDER STUFF.
GET UP WITH THE TITS AND THEN GIVE THEM THE ALZHEIMER'S FOR DESSERT.
EXACTLY.
OKAY. LET'S PUT THAT TO A LAB TEST. BY INTERVIEWING DR. EVA FELDMAN, ONE OF THE WORLD'S PREEMINENT NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCHERS.
AND IN A PHASE ONE DRUG TRIAL, WHAT YOU...
ASK HER ABOUT HER SEX LIFE.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.
DO IT.
I KNOW THERE'S CAMERAS AND EVERYTHING, BUT FEEL FREE TO TALK OPENLY ABOUT ANYTHING IN TERMS OF YOUR PERSONAL LIFE OR THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF SOME OF THE STAFF HERE. THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION YOU WANT TO SHARE.
I DON'T.
OKAY. DIDN'T THINK SO.
THESE NERDS DIDN'T GET IT. TODAY NEWS IS ONLY THE THINGS PEOPLE WANT TO CLICK ON. DO YOU FEEL THAT WHAT YOU DID AT GAWKER INFLUENCED NEWS?
I THINK IT DEFINITELY DID INFLUENCE NEWS. I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS WHICH STORY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT...
THIS ZOO ADOPTED A STRAY CAT THAT MADE FRIENDS WITH A LYNX.
IMAGINE THAT. I THINK IT DEFINITELY INFLUENCED A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HOW...
KATE UPTON ON A TRAMPOLINE.
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
SORRY.
I TELL YOU, IT PROBABLY HAS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON...
CAN I GET THAT IN THREE WORDS OR LESS?
YES, IT HAS.
GREAT. I'LL LEAD WITH THAT. IT WAS TIME TO GIVE THESE STUDENTS SOME JOURNALISTIC INSPIRATION.
ADORABLE BABY DRESSED AS A DOCTOR. WHO IS A CLICKABLE BABY?
FOR THE EXOTICS DESK, BABY LION.
WE'RE NOT INSURED. LET'S GET HIM AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE.
AND WHO WANTS SIDE-BOOB DESK? [CLICKING] ALL RIGHT. AND AFTER A FEW EARLY HURDLES --
WOAH, WHO DID THIS?
I DID.
THIS IS GREAT. TAKE A PICTURE OF IT AND PUT IT ONLINE.
THEY FINALLY STARTED FIGURING IT OUT. >>WHAT DO YOU GOT?
DRONIES.
A SELFIE WITH A DRONE?
REMEMBER, WHEN THIS THING GETS CLOSE WAVE. THERE WE GO. ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL...RUN, RUN. [BLEEPED] AND WHEN THE NEW PAPER FINALLY ARRIVED, THE STUDENTS COULDN'T DENY THE GENIUS OF NEETZAN'S WAYS.
THIS IS GREAT, RIGHT?
THIS IS [BLEEPED].
NO, KID, THIS IS NEWS.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
