FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, LAURA POITRAS, SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF "CITIZENFOUR," A TREMENDOUS DOCUMENTARY ABOUT EDWARD SNOWDEN AND THE NSA CASE. FIRST, FIRST, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. YEARS OF INCONSISTENT POLICY ENFORCEMENT. AND THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY WANT TO GET WITH US. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T THINK THEY'RE READY FOR THIS JELLY. THEY HAVE LEFT US WITH ROUGHLY 11 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS WITH ONLY ONE SHOWING ANY INTEREST IN GOING HOME. (LAUGHTER) AND, RED RUM. DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT FINGER, DIFFERENT FINGER. I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW ON FEBRUARY 14th, 2013, I LOGGED ON TO GOOGLE HANGOUT TO-- I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS. TO FIND OUT IF OUR PRESIDENT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITHOUT CONGRESS.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO NOW UNTIL THE TIME IMMIGRATION REFORM IS PASSED TO INSURE THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING DEPORTED.
MY JOB IS TO EXECUTE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED. AND CONGRESS RIGHT NOW HAS NOT CHANGED WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I'M NOT THE EMPEROR OF THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: AH! TRUE, THAT IS TRUE! I MEAN LET'S BE FRANK. DO YOU REALLY THINK THE EMPEROR OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE SPENDING TIME ON VALENTINE'S DAY ON GOOGLE HANGOUT? I DON'T THINK SO HE'S THE EMPEROR. WELL, GUESS WHAT, THOUGH, HE WASN'T THE EMPEROR THEN, BUT A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER-- IS THAT HE'S OFF TO THE RACES? WHAT? THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE IMPERIAL MARGARINE THE THING, YOU KNOW, WHERE THE HAT COMES ON. I'M REALLY [BLEEP] OLD. (LAUGHTER) NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT. ANYWAY, SOMEBODY IS ABOUT TO GO EMPEROR ON THAT.
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CAN DO THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTION.
Jon: HMMMM! HMMMM! (LAUGHTER) BASICALLY ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE BAD MIDTERM ELECTION TO MAKE OBAMA GO FROM THIS.
I'M NOT THE EMPEROR OF THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: TO THIS.
GOOD TO BE THE KING. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER THING IS HAPPENING. BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THIS IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER THING GOING TO BE EXACTLY?
ALLOWING THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE U.S. CITIZENS TO REMAIN IN THE U.S. AND RECEIVE WORK PERMITS.
AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WOULD HALT DEPORTATION FOR AN ESTIMATED 5 MILLION PEOPLE.
EXPANDING THE PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO CAME AS CHILDREN, THE SO-CALLED DREAMERS, AND EXTENDING IT TO THEIR PARENTS.
Jon: OOH, IS THAT REALLY WHAT THE DREAMERS WANTED? I DON'T RECALL ANY MY TEENAGE DREAMS INVOLVING MY PARENTS STAYING. THAT'S ALL. OH GOOD, LEGISLATION WAS PASSED SO I CAN SPEND MORE TIME WITH MOM. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT'S OBAMA'S PLAN. HOW IS CONGRESS TAKING IT? I'M GOING TO GO WITH UNBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM?
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THE PRESIDENT TOOTH AND NAIL. THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO GOVERN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU HAD TO GO BACK TO YOUR NOTE CARDS FOR THE WORD GOVERN? THIS IS NOT HOW WE--  (LAUGHTER) WHAT WERE WE ELECTED TO DO AGAIN? WHAT WAS-- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. GOVERN. YOU CAN'T SPACE OUT ON YOUR PRIMARY FUNCTION. IT WITH BE LIKE THE INCREDIBLE HULK GOING-- HULK! (LAUGHTER) SMASH. SORRY, SORRY. HULK SMASH, SORRY. HULK-- HULK BLANK, HULK BLANK, HULK SORRY. BUT ALL RIGHT, SO ANYWAY, THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO GOVERN. (LAUGHTER) WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY AS REPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE TO GOVERN?
SOME REPUBLICANS HAVE SUGGESTED THEY MAY BLOCK SPENDING PROPOSALS IN PROTEST SPARKING FEARS OF YET ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.
IMPEACHMENT WOULD BE A CONSIDERATION.
Jon: SEE, YOU DONE GOVERN THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER. YOU GOVERN THROUGH SHUTDOWNS AND IMPEACHMENT. BUT RIDDLE ME THIS, BATMAN, HOW DO YOU CONDUCT IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS WHEN YOU'VE SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. HA, HA, HA. NEWSPAPER SPIN, NEWSPAPER SPIN. DU-DA-LA DU-DA-LA DU-DA-LA DA. NO, DON'T-- LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING. THAT JUST WINDED ME. BUT OF COURSE SAYING YOU WOULD SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT IN PROTEST DOESN'T MEAN YOU WOULD BE THE ONE SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. WATCH BOBBY JINDAL (R.) GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA MAKE WEIRD MAGIC.
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO BREAK THE CONSTITUTION. THE REALITY IS THIS. I DO THINK --
YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE SHUTTING DOWN THE GOVERNMENT?
OH ABSOLUTELY.
SO YOU DO WANT REPUBLICANS TO FIGHT HIM ON THIS, TO THE POINT THAT IT COULD SHUT DONE THE GOVERNMENT.
ABSOLUTELY, LET'S STEP BACK. I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
Jon: YOU WOULD BE SHUTTING DOWN-- IT'S LIKE WATCHING A NON-JEDI TRY A JEDI MIND TRICK. THESE ARE NOT THE DRAWINGS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. YOU MEAN THESE DRAWINGS RIGHT HERE? ABSOLUTE-- NO, NO, NO, RIGHT, THESE DRAWINGS IN MY BACKSEAT ARE NOT THE ONES -- I'M JUST SAYING. BUT FOR REAL DISINGENUOUS OR LACK OF AWARENESS, YOU MUST ONLY LOOK TO MITTENTING JAY ROMNEY'S REASON AS TO WHY OBAMA SHOULD NOT FOLLOW REAGAN AND BUSH #1 AND NOT TAKE ACTION ON IMMIGRATION.
THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT TO LEARN THAT HE LOST THIS LAST ELECTION ROUND. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SPOKE LOUD AND CLEAR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ME THINKS THE PRESIDENT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A HEARING AND LEARNING PROBLEM. YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAYING QUITE LOUDLY AND CLEARLY A FEW YEARS BACK, IX NAY ON THE IT-MAY AND YET HERE ARE YOU ON THE ELEVISION-TAY. TALKING IT-SHAY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I APOLOGIZE. YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU HAVEN'T AGED AT ALL. WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? PROBABLY NOT BEING PRESIDENT. BUT THE THING THAT BOTHERS REPUBLICANS THE MOST -- THE THING THAT BOTHERS REPUBLICANS THE MOST ISN'T WHAT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTION WOULD MEAN FOR IMMIGRATION POLICY OR THE BALANCE OF POWER IN WASHINGTON, IT'S WHAT OBAMA IS DOING TO OUR CONSTITUTION.
A FLAGRANT ASSAULT ON THE CONSTITUTION.
MEANS RIP IT UP. MEANS NOTHINGING RIP IT UP.
IS IT TIME THE PRESIDENT JUST ALREADY DO THIS ALREADY, TORCH THE CONSTITUTION? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LOOK WHO'S INTO A LITTLE CONSTITUTION TORTURE PORN.
OF COURSE IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE SCREAMING ABOUT OBAMA DESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION THROUGH HIS EXECUTIVE ACTION.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS TRASHING THE CONSTITUTION.
HE SHREDDED THE CONSTITUTION WITH THE AUTO BAILOUTS.
SHREDDED THE CONSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY DURING THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE.
HIS NOMINATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT, IGNORING THE CONSTITUTION.
CASH FOR CLUNKERS, HE VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION.
HE WANTS TO DESTROY THE CONSTITUTION.
SHRED OUR CONSTITUTION.
JUST SHRED THE CONSTITUTION.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP] HAS BEEN SHREDDING THE CONSTITUTION SINCE FEBRUARY OF 2009. LIKE 20 DAYS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY. HE MUST BE DOING IT ARTICLE BY ARTICLE, SAW STYLE. HOW COULD OBAMA BE DESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION NOW IF THERE IS NO CONSTITUTION LEFT FOR HIM TO DESTROY? HOW MANY TIMES DOES HE HAVE TO KILL THIS THING! OR MAYBE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, THIS WHITE HOUSE TOUCHES, THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THAT RIGHT. PARCHMENT JAM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
