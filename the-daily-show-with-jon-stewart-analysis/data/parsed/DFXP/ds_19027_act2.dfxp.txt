[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS QUITE TASTY. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY. HERE IS HOW BADLY ROB FORD -- [LAUGHTER] -- HAS (bleep) CANADA.
THIS MIGHT COME AS WELCOME NEWS FOR TORONTO THIS MORNING WHEN IT COMES TO COCAINE AND POLITICS, CANADA HAS NO MONOPOLY.
Jon: TORONTO, CANADA IS NOW THE GO-TO SHORTHAND REFERENCE FOR COCAINE STORIES. ME AND MY FRIENDS TONIGHT ARE GOING TO CANADA, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WE'RE GOING TO CANADA TONIGHT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO CANADA AND GET SO ELECTED. SO ELECTED. TELL ME WHAT POLITICAL BODY HAS JOINED THE QUEEN CITY IN THE ELECTORAL NOSE CANDY CLUB.
ABOUT 30 MINUTES A U.S. CONGRESSMAN IS DUE IN COURT TO FACE A CHARGE OF COCAINE POSSESSION.
Jon: A U.S. WHAT -- SHOULDN'T BE TOO SURPRISED WE ALL REMEMBER THE SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK ON HOW A BILL BECOMES A STRAW. WHICH CONGRESSMAN GOT BUSTED THERE?
ELECTED WITH 62% OF THE VOTE IN NAPLES FLORIDA.
REPUBLICAN TREY RADEL.
Jon: TREY RADEL WAS PARTYING WITH CHUCK HAGEL AND ELENA KAGAN. WERE THERE ANY SIGNS?
THE CONGRESSMAN ADMITTED HIS FAVORITE VACATION SPOT WAS CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WERE THERE ANY SIGNS? ANYTHING? ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE TIPPED US OFF THAT HE WAS A COCAINE USER? ANYTHING YOU FOUND? ANYTHING?
RADEL WHO CALLS HIMSELF A HIP-HOP CONSERVATIVE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: A HIP-HOP CONSERVATIVE -- THAT CAN'T GO TOGETHER. THEY CAN'T -- I'M A HIP-HOP CONSERVATIVE -- YOU CAN'T BE. I'M A SMOOTH JAZZ ANARCHIST. I'M A DISCO NAZI. YOU CAN'T -- IT DOESN'T -- HOW ARE YOU A HIP-HOP CONSERVATIVE.
HE BREAKS DOWN WHAT HE SAYS IS THE CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE BEHIND PUBLIC ENEMIES FIGHT THE POWER.
IF YOU REALLY GET DOWN TO IT IN MANY WAYS REFLECTS THE CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE OF HAVING A HEAVY HANDED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
Jon: IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. I GUESS FLAVA FLAV IS WEARING A DEBT CLOCK. IS THAT WHAT THAT IS? AND 2 LIVE CREW IS AN ODE TO TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. I GUESS WE CAN GET HIS NEW BOOK I DO NOT UNDERSTAND RAP MUSIC."  WE'RE ALL HUMAN, WE MAKE MISTAKES THE PROBLEM COMES IF THERE'S A NUGGET OF HYPOCRISY IN HIS STORY.
HE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION FORCING FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS TO PASS A DRUG TEST BEFORE RECEIVING BENEFITS.
Jon: (bleep). IT'S NOT LIKE HE RECEIVES ANY TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR HIS SALARY. OH, RIGHT. HE HAS TWO CHOICES HE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE HIS MISBEHAVIOR OR DENY HE IS AT FAULT AND KNOCK OVER CAMERAMEN AND ELDERLY POLITICIANS. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE ROB FORD WAY.
HE RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING HE IS PROFOUNDLY STORE SORRY TO LET DOWN THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. HE SAYS HE KNOWS HE HAS A PROBLEM AND WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO OVERCOME IT.
Jon: GOOD FOR HIM. IF ONLY HE MADE THE DECISION BEFORE THE TATTOO.
