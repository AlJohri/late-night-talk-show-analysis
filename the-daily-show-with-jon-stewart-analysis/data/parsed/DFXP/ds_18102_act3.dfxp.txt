I'M GREAT. WELL, I FEEL MUCH BETTER  AFTER THAT, THAT WAS LOVELY. THANK YOU.
Jon: THEY'RE VERY NICE  PEOPLE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.
Jon: THERE ARE A FEW  GUESTS THAT COME OUT ON THE  SHOW THAT I FEEL LIKE I WISH I HAD A HOUSE BAND. YOU'RE ONE OF-- I FEEL LIKE  BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A  WONDERFUL, LIVE PERFORMER,  YOU'RE A STAGE ACTOR, MUSICAL STUFF. MOST PEOPLE TIMES ITS HE  AUTHORS AND THEY GOT A BOOK  THAT THEY WROTE ABOUT SOME COUNTRY NOBODY CARES ABOUT. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, YEAH, AND THE HOUSE  BAND WOULD GET IN THE WAY OF  THAT.
Jon: THANK YOU.
YEAH. SO IT'S-- YEAH, IT'S  DIFFICULT LINE YOU WALK.
Jon: DOES IT MAKE A  DIFFERENCE TO YOU THE  PERFORMER, DO YOU PREFER TO  WALK OUT TO A THING AND HAVE SOMEONE TO GO LIKE-- YOU  KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE WHEN  YOU COME OUT ON LETTERMAN  YOU GOT PAUL SHAFFER AND YOU CAN COME OUT AND BEFORE YOU  GET UP TO DAVE YOU CAN GO TO  PAUL LIKE-- YOU KNOW WHAT I  MEAN? (LAUGHTER)
WELL, THERE IS-- .
Jon: IT HELPS, RIGHT?
IT IS A KIND OF FAMILY  ATMOSPHERE, YES. IT IS-- THEY ALWAYS PLAY,  IT'S GOOD OLD RELIABLE  NATHAN WHEN I SHOW UP.
Jon: DO THEY REALLY.
SO I FEEL LIKE I NOW HAVE  A SLIGHT JACK BENNY, LOVE IN  BLOOM, I HAVE A THEME. IT'S GOOD OLD RELIABLE  NATHAN FROM GUISE AND DOLLS.
Jon: THAT'S GREAT. YOU STRIKE ME AS THAT TYPE  OF-- THAT IS WHAT IS SO  INTERESTING ABOUT THE NANCE.
ABOUT JIM NANS THE  SPORTSCASTER.
Jon: JIM NANCE THE  SUPPORT SUPPORTEDS CASTER.
AS OPPOSED TO TO JIM  NANCE THE EXNFL FULLBACK. THAN IS THE MOST I HAVE EVER  DISCUSSED SPORTS IN MY  ENTIRE LIFE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DO YOU KNOW JIM  NANCE, FROM THE SAINTS.
I BELIEVE SO. I HEAR YOU, BROTHER. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
Jon: WHERE ARE WE? I THOUGHT WE ORDERED WIDGS.
OKAY SO, I'M HERE, SO I  ALWAYS TRY TO BRING YOU ONE  LITTLE NEWS ITEM THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED JSES ALL  RIGHT, LET ME HEAR IT.
SO A WOMAN WHEN SHE WAS A  CHILD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A  DISEASE CALLED, WELL, NOT A DISEASE, LET'S CALL IT A  SYNDROME CALLED TOP  GRAPHICAL DISORIENTATION. WHICH MEANS SHE CONSTANTLY  FEELS LOST. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, NOT UNLIKE THE  FORMER BUSH ADMINISTRATION. AND--   (LAUGHTER)
AND SO.
Jon: WELL DONE.
SO SHE, AND FOR EXAMPLE,  SHE WAS DRIVING HOME SHE  MIGHT NOT RECOGNIZE HER  HOUSE. AND THEN IF SHE WAS LUCKY  ENOUGH TO FIND HER HOUSE,  SHE COULD GET LOST IN THE  HOUSE.
Jon: WOW.
AND WHICH IS TOUGH AFTER  A LARGE MEXICAN MEAL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I HADN'T THOUGHT OF  THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW, THE WORST  PART OF THIS STORY, THE  SADDEST PART IS THAT HER MOTHER TAKING A PAGE OUT OF  THE JOAN CRAWFORD HANDBOOK  NOLDER, SHE SHOULD NOT TELL ANYONE OR SHE WOULD BE  BURNED AS A WITCH. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH COINCIDENTALLY WHAT MY  MOTHER SAID TO ME WHEN I  TOLD HER I WAS GAY. I REALLY RELATE TO THIS  STORY.
Jon: HOW DID YOU BRING  THAT ALL THE WAY AROUND.
I DON'T KNOW BUT GAY AND  NOW THE PLAY. WE CAN-- NOW WE CAN TALK  ABOUT THE PLAY.
Jon: BUT THAT'S THE THING  ABOUT THE PLAY THAT IS SO  INTERESTING. THERE ARE VERY FEW  PERFORMERS THAT YOU WOULD  IMAGINE MULTITALENTED  PERFORMERS WOULD WOULD BE AS COMFORTABLE IN THE TYPE OF  PERFORMING THAT WAS NEEDED  IN THE 1920s, IN THE 1930s. THOSE GUYS WERE, THEY COULD  DO ANYTHING. PLAY AN INSTRUMENT, SING A  SONG, TELL A JOKE, DO A  SERIOUS THING AM ARE YOU ONE OF THE GUYS THAT COULD HAVE  DONE THAT.
WELL, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, IT'S-- A LOT OF  GREAT COMEDIANS DID COME OUT  OF BURR LESSING, PHIL  SILVERS AND ABBOTT AND COSTELLO AND THERE  WERE-- THE GREAT STARS OF  BURLESQUE, THE PLAY ITSELF  IS A BEAUTIFUL BRAVE PLAY BY DOUGLAS CARTER BEAN.
Jon: GREAT WRITER.
IT'S ABOUT MANY, MANY  THINGS. SORT OF THE END OF BURLESQUE  IN 1937 WHEN THEY WERE  TRYING TO SHUT THEM ALL  DOWN. AND IN PARTICULAR, THIS  CHARACTER THAT I PLAY WHO  PLAYS A SORT OF CARICATURE  OF AN HE FEM KNIT DAY MANN IN SKETCHES AND HE HIMSELF  IS A REPUBLICAN AND A  CONSERVATIVE AND VERY MUCH A  SUPPORTER OF LAGUARDIA WHO, AND THE PEOPLE WHO  EVENTUALLY SORT OF BRING HIM  DOWN AND SORT OF PUT AN END  TO HIS LIVELIHOOD. AND AT THE HEART OF IT, AT  THE CENTRE OF IT IS THIS  SORT OF SURPRISING AND SAD  LOVE STORY OF HIM AND A YOUNGER MAN. AND SORT OF ONE GENERATION  AND THE NEXT.
Jon: RIGHT. AS A MAN WHO PLAYS THE  NANCE.
YES.
Jon: HE ALMOST CAN'T GIVE  HIMSELF UP TO LOVE THIS  OTHER GUY BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE THAT CLEARLY WOULD-- HE  REALLY BELIEVES IT IN HIS  HEAD THAT THIS CAN'T BE  RIGHT.
WELL, YEAH, YES, HE IS  KIND OF A VICTIM OF HIS OWN  SELF-LOATHING. AND INABILITY TO ACCEPT THAT  KIND OF LOVE. AND WHAT WOULD BE A KIND OF  BY TODAY'S STANDARDS A VERY  HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP. AND I THINK ALSO BECAUSE OF  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT IS  HAPPENING IN HIS LIFE, HE MAKES A LOT OF WRONG  DECISIONS. >>.
Jon: HOW DO YOU-- YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS 8  SHOWS A WEEK. THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE  GOT TO PUT OUT A  GUT-WRENCHING, COMPLEX.
I WAS CALLED-- BETH  MIDLER CALLED ME BECAUSE SHE  IS DOING I'LL EAT YOU LAST. SHE SAID HOW MANY AND-- IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE  CONVERSATION SHE SAID AND  HOW MANY AGAIN DO YOU HAVE TO DO EACH WEEK. AND I SAID 8. AND SHE SAID WHAT IS THIS, A  SWEATSHOP IN HAITI? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT IS EXACTLY A  SWEATSHOP IN HAITI. THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE  WORKING IN A SWEATSHOP IN  HAITI?
WELL.
Jon: WEARING 1930s  VAUDEVILLIAN CLOTHES.
IT-- IT IS GREAT WHEN THE  MATERIAL IS THIS GOOD AND  WITH A CAST THIS TERRIFIC. AND IT'S BEEN-- THE WHOLE  THING HAS BEEN A VERY HAPPY  COLLABORATION.
Jon: HOW LONG IS IT GOING  TO RUN. ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP GOING  WITH IT.
NO, NO, WE'VE TO YOU BEEN  EXTENDED TO AUGUST 11th. SO FOR MOST OF THE SUMMER.
Jon: EVERYONE SHOULD GO  SEE IT, UNLESS YOU DON'T  LIKE GOOD ACTING AND  ENTERTAINING, WHICH YOU KNOW, YOU MAY NOT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR  PREFERENCES ARE. BUT THE NANCE, THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR COMING BY, THE  NANCE ON BROADWAY, THE  LYCEUM THEATRE. THE GREAT NATHAN LANE,  EVERYBODY.
