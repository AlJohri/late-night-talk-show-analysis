( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. IN A FEW MINUTES, BASSEM YOUSSEF WILL BE JOINING US. HE A VERY, VERY SHARP, FUNNY OBSERVER OF EGYPTIAN POLITICS BUT WE THOUGHT, BOY, BEFORE HE  COMES OUT, MAYBE WE SHOULD DO A QUICK REVIEW OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON-- NOT THAT AMERICANS  REPORT UP ON IT. WE'RE UP ON IT. WE'VE-- UP ON IT.   (  LAUGHTER  )  SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON. HOSNI MUBARAK, WAS EGYPT'S LEADER, U.S.-BACKED LEADER FOR 30 YEARS. HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR AMONGST HIS PEOPLE, TYPICALLY WINNING ELECTIONS BETWEEN 98% AND 127%  OF THE VOTES.   (  LAUGHTER  )  IN ANY GIVEN ELECTION. HE WAS SO BELOVED SO POPULAR, LAST WINTER HIS PEOPLE DEMANDED HE TAKE A WELL-DESERVED RETIREMENT.   ( LAUGHTER )  LEST THEY GROW TO LOVE HIM. THEY JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SMOTHER HIM. SO WHERE IS HE NOW?
THE BIG STORY HERE TODAY IS BREAKING, A REPORT THAT FORMER EGYPTIAN HOSNI MUBARAK IS  CLINICALLY DEAD.   (  LAUGHTER  )
Jon:  THE NEWS NOW OFFICIAL, 11:15 P.M., EASTERN STANDARD TIME, HOSNI MUBARAK--  SORRY, WE'RE GETTING AN UPDATE.
THE FORMER EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK IS NOW REPORTEDLY IN A COMA.
Jon:  OKAY, HE WAS DEAD, BUT NOW HE'S IN A COMA. WAIT, HOW CAN YOU TELL? WHENEVER YOU SEE HIM HE'S JUST ON A BED WEARING SUN GLASSES?   ( LAUGHTER )  MAYBE HE DIED WEEKS AGO AND THE  EGYPTIAN MILITARY IS PULLING A "WEEKEND AT HOSNI'S" THING. YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW. HAUGH LAUGH   ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WAIT. WHY WOULD THEY SAY MUBARAK WAS DEAD AND THEN SAY HE WAS IN A COMMA? WHY WOULD THEY LIE ABOUT IT?
MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED SO HE COULD BE PULLED OUT OF THAT PRISON AND SENT BACK TO THE  MILITARY HOSPITAL WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS UP UNTIL HIS TRIAL WHERE THE  CONDITIONS ARE MUCH BETTER.
Jon:  AAAH. SO THIS IS ALL JUST A BIG CON TO GET MUBARAK A NICER HOSPITAL ROOM. OH, WHAT'S WRONG, HOSNI? SEMIPRIVATE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? YOUR CAN ROOMMATE TOOY? I DON'T THINK SO!   ( LAUGHTER )  NO, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT EGYPT. MUMMIES ARE APPARENTLY EVERYWHERE. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THE TIME OF DICTATORSHIP AND EGYPT DONE. HERE'S THE NEW REALITY--
EGYPTIANS TURNED OUT IN HUGE NUMBERS TODAY TO VOTE IN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS STARTING  TODAY, THE FIRST SINCE HOSNI MUBARAK WAS TOPPLED LAST FEBRUARY.
I GOTTA TELL YOU, WATCHING PEOPLE GET THEIR FIRST TASTE OF FREEDOM NEVER GETS OLD.
ISLAMIST PARTIES HAVE WON A MAJORITY OF SEATS IN THE FIRST  ROUND OF EGYPT'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD PARTYARCHS PEERS TO  BE ONE OF THE MAJOR WINNERS.
THEY ARE VEHEMENTLY ANTI-ISRAELI, THEY'RE NOT PRO-AMERICAN.
Jon:  WHAT IS WITH THE ANTI--AMERICAN STUFF? WHAT DID WE DO TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD EXCEPT SUPPORT A DICTATOR WHO OPPRESSED THEM FOR  30 YEARS MAY OR MAY NOT BE A RAY-BAN WEARING CORPSE. EGYPT HELD ELECTIONS ANY THE COUNTRY CAN MOVE FORWARD.
THE MILITARY DISSOLVED THE FIRST FREELY ELECT THE PARLIAMENT.
Jon:  WE'RE BACKWARDS. BACKWARDS IS NICE, TOO. AT LEAST THE PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF ELECTION WENT OVER THE WEEKEND, RIGHT, FREE AND FAIR, CLEAR WINNER?
UNOFFICIAL RESULTS SHOW THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
THE EGYPT ELECTION COMMITTEE SAID IT WILL NOT ANNOUNCE THE RUNOFF WINNER TOMORROW AT ALL. IT HAS TO REVIEW HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VOTING.   ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION BECAUSE IN A COUNTRY OF  83 MILLION PEOPLE, YOU GOT... HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS.   ( LAUGHTER )  YOU'RE NEW TO THE DEMOCRACY THING. I GET THAT. HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS? YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S CALLED IN FLORIDA?   ( LAUGHTER )  THE BEST, MOST EFFICIENT  ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF FLORIDA.   ( APPLAUSE )  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?   ( CHEERING )  TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN! YOU GET MORE COMPLAINTS A NIGHT IN BOCA RATON AT AN OLIVE GARDEN.   (  LAUGHTER  )  "THE SALAD BAR PLATES ARE VERY SMALL. I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH."   ( LAUGHTER )   WAIT, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT THING THE MILITARY DID, THE DISSOLVING  DISSOLVING OF THE PARLIAMENT, WOULD IT?
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE GATHERED OPPOSING WHAT THEY SEE AS A MILITARY CUE.
THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT, THEY'RE AFRAID OF A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD PRESIDENT.
Jon:  JUST LIKE ITS AILING EX-LEADER EGYPTIAN DEMOCRACY IS EITHER DEAD, IN A  COMA OR TRYING TO GET A BETTER ROOM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
