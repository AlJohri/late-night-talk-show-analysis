FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." VERY EXCITED TO SEE YOU HERE TONIGHT. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS SHOW. WE'VE BEEN PLANNING IT ALMOST ALL DAY. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HELEN THORPE. SHE IS THE AUTHOR OF "SOLDIER GIRLS: THE BATTLES OF THREE WOMEN AT HOME AND AT WAR." BUT FIRST, BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THE SHOW, BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING, IT'S BEEN A LONG SUMMER. WE'VE GOT GOOD NEWS. GOOD NEWS. THEY DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE WAITING FOR IT. GOOD NEWS? I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. THE SUMMER STARTED OUT A LITTLE DOOMSDAY-Y. BUT THINGS ARE SETTLING DOWN. YOU GOT YOUR PUTIN THERE FINALLY BEING SANCTIONED. SO, HE'S CALMING DOWN, HE'S MAYBE PUTTING A SHIRT ON. [LAUGHTER] YOU GOT A CEASEFIRE FINALLY IN GAZA. OH, PLEASE LET IT HOLD. TIME FOR EVERYBODY TO TAKE A BREATH, CALM DOWN. IT'S ALL GOOD.
EBOLA ALERT.
FAST-GROWING EBOLA OUTBREAK.
ONE OF THE MOST FEARED AND DEADLY DISEASES ON EARTH.
SURGING OUT OF CONTROL.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED]! OH, MY GOD. WHAT THE [BLEEPED]. [APPLAUSE] [BLEEPED] THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A GOOD GIF. ALL RIGHT. WHAT THE [BLEEPED]. FIRST IT WAS WAR. THEN IT WAS PLAGUE. WE'RE EITHER IN THE END TIMES OR A SCI-FI ORIGINAL MOVIE. WE'RE ALL IN DANGER.
THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION REPORTS THERE ARE NOW 1,603 CASES IN WEST AFRICA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OH, I DIDN'T UH, WELL, THAT'S TERRIBLE FOR THOSE COUNTRIES. I DIDN'T REALIZE. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I WON'T BE NEEDING THIS. WHY DON'T I JUST CUT IT UP FOR PARTS BECAUSE ONCE YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT CUT THE HOOD UP BEFORE YOU THROW IT AWAY, OTHERWISE I THINK DOLPHINS GET STUCK IN IT OR SOMETHING. [LAUGHTER]
THERE ARE NEW FEARS TONIGHT ABOUT THE EBOLA OUTBREAK RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. DOCTORS AT MT. SINAI HOSPITAL ARE PERFORMING TESTS ON A PATIENT WHO IS SHOWING POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE VIRUS.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW DO WE KNOW THIS PATIENT EVEN HAS EBOLA?
THE MALE PATIENT ARRIVED HERE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM EARLY THIS MORNING WITH A HIGH FEVER AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS, WHICH COULD BE CAUSED BY MANY DIFFERENT ILLNESSES.
Jon: YEAH, NO KIDDING. HE'S GOT A FEVER AND DIARRHEA. THAT'S IT? I MEAN, YOU'RE SAYING HE COULD HAVE EBOLA, OR MAYBE HE JUST GOT HIS LUNCH HERE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S WHAT WE IN NEW YORK CALL OUR-BOLA. [LAUGHTER] DID YOU KNOW THAT ALL NEW YORK DOCTORS ARE ACTUALLY TRAINED TO ASK, HAVE YOU BEEN TO WEST AFRICA OR EATEN AT A SALAD BAR THAT ALSO SELLS CONDOMS AND CIGARETTES? WELL, WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE RESULTS OF THE EBOLA TEST, I'M SURE THE HOSPITAL IS TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION.
THE HOSPITAL SAID ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS, VISITORS AND STAFF. THE HOSPITAL SAYS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND CITY OFFICIALS.
Jon: I'M NOT AN EPIDEMOLOGIST OR IMMUNOLOGIST OR VERSED IN DISEASE CONTROL, BUT A GOOD START TO A SOLID QUARANTINE I THINK WOULD BE SHUTTING THAT [BLEEPED] DOOR. AM I, AM I WRONG HERE? WHAT? YOU GOT... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, RIGHT NOW YOU'RE TRYING PULL A QUARANTINE. EBOLA COULD JUST STROLL RIGHT OUTSIDE. IT WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO HURRY. DO-DO-DO. NOW LOOK PROBABLY THIS GUY DOESN'T EVEN HAVE EBOLA, BUT IF HE DOES, IS THE CITY SCREWED?
DR. ALEXANDER VAN TULLEKEN TELLS ME EVEN AN ACTUAL EBOLA CASE IN NEW YORK CITY WOULD NOT BE CAUSE FOR PANIC.
IT'S NOT LIKE FLU WHERE IT CAN BE CARRIED IN DROPLETS IN THE AIR. EBOLA NEEDS DIRECT CONTACT WITH BODILY FLUIDS CONTAINING THE VIRUS.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU PEOPLE, BUT I THINK DR. AFLAC HERE JUST GAVE ME SOME EBOLA. RIGHT HERE. DIRECT CONTACT WITH BODILY FLUIDS, HUH? WORTH IT. [LAUGHTER] SO MAYBE IT'S NOT TOO BAD, EVEN IF THIS PATIENT IS INFECTED, WE CAN HANDLE ONE CASE. THIS IS NEW YORK CITY, BABY. AS LONG AS ALL THE OTHER CASES STAY OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
THE SECOND AMERICAN DOCTOR INFECTED WITH THE EBOLA VIRUS HAS JUST LANDED IN ATLANTA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO WE'RE IMPORTING EBOLA NOW. THAT'S GOT TO BE THE WORST AIRPORT PICK-UP GIG EVER. NOW, DON'T THESE PEOPLE REALIZE EBOLA HAS NO TREATMENT, NO CURE, NO TREATMENT. SURE, YOU BRING 'EM HERE TO THE UNITED STATES. WHAT ARE THEY EVEN GOING DO FOR THESE PATIENTS?
DOCTORS ARE TRYING OUT A BRAND-NEW APPROACH TO FIGHTING THE DISEASE WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL SERUM.
TOP-SECRET SERUM.
MAGIC SERUM.
HIS BREATHING STRAIGHTENED OUT, THE RASH ON HIS BODY WENT AWAY AND HIS VITAL SIGNS ALL, EVERYTHING SORT OF RETURNED TO A MORE NORMAL STATE.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, THERE'S APPARENTLY A CURE FOR EBOLA FOR AMERICANS.  [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, I IMAGINE THERE'S A CONTINENT RIGHT ABOUT NOW GOING, UM, I HAVE AN IDEA, WHY DON'T YOU SAVE [BLEEPED] FOR MOSQUITO NETS AND GIVE US SOME OF THAT EBOLA JUICE. MEANWHILE, SENIOR HEALTH CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS MORE ON THE POTENTIAL OUTBREAK. JESS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
OH, MY GOODNESS, THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: JESS, JESS, IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
JON, EBOLA'S REAL AS [BLEEPED]. AND IT'S RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK.
Jon: ARE YOU, JESSICA, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YES, JON, I'M SO SERIOUS. EBOLA IS IN NEW YORK SPREADING FAST THROUGH CHELSEA, THE WEST VILLAGE AND TRIBECA AND ESPECIALLY LOCATIONS WITHIN A FEW BLOCKS OF THE 123 SUBWAY LINE. RESIDENTS IN THOSE AREAS MUST LEAVE THEIR APARTMENTS NOW, JON. NOW!
Jon: THAT IS, JESSICA, THAT IS INCREDIBLE. THIS IS THE FIRST THAT I HAVE HEARD OF THIS, THAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD OF THIS. YOU'VE BROKEN SOME NEWS. JUST THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS, JESS?
WELL, I MEAN, JON, IT COULD ALSO HIT A COUPLE OF NICE NEIGHBORHOODS IN BROOKLYN, TOO, BUT DEFINITELY NOTHING OFF THE G TRAIN, JON, DEFINITELY NOT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JESS, ARE THERE ANY MORE SPECIFICS?
OH, YEAH, JON, HOLD ON.
Jon: YES.
I'M BEING TOLD THE EBOLA COULD REALLY HIT HARDEST IN PREWAR BUILDINGS WITH GOOD STORAGE AND WASHER DRYERS. YEAH, JON, AND I REALLY MEAN IN-UNIT WASHER/DRYERS, NOT ANY OF THAT NEXT DOOR, AROUND THE CORNER BULL [BLEEPED].
Jon: WAIT, I...
REALLY.
Jon: I SEE. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING IN THE OUTER BOROUGHS, QUEENS AND THE BRONX.
OH YEAH, [BLEEPED] NO. EBOLA IS NOT GOING TO SPEND AN HOUR COMMUTING EVERY DAMN DAY. NO JON, EBOLA IS DEFINITELY NOT PRESENT IN QUEENS, BUT IF YOU LIVE IN AN UPPER WEST SIDE ONE BEDROOM WITH BIG SOUTH-FACING WINDOWS, ORIGINAL DETAILS, A STEAM SHOWER AND A DOORMAN, YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. DEFINITELY.
Jon: JESSICA, YOU KNOW, I HESITATE TO BRING THIS UP OBVIOUSLY.
Jon: SURE.
Jon: YOUR CREDENTIALS REPORTING IN THE HEALTH FIELD ARE IMPECCABLE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: BUT IT APPEARS YOU'RE USING THIS EBOLA SCARE TO CREATE A REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOURSELF.
WHAT?
Jon: NO, THAT'S JUST... THAT'S JUST GENERAL...
JON, HOW DARE YOU!
Jon: I'M JUST SUGGESTING...
I AM A PROFESSIONAL NEWS WOMAN OF AUTHORITY.
Jon: NO, I JUST...
I WOULD NEVER EVER... [COUGHING]
Jon: JESS? JESS, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? JESS?
OH [BLEEPED]. I GOT THE VIRUS, JON!
Jon: WHAT? WHAT?
I HAVE THE DANGEROUS EBOLA, JON.
Jon: WHAT?
I THINK I NEED TO BE QUARANTINED UP IN THAT PENTHOUSE FOR $1,100 A MONTH AND LIKE NO BROKERS FEE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, JESSICA, JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
