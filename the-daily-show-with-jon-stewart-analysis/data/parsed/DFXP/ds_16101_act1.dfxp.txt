FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," EVERYBODY. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S MY CRYPT KEEPER IMPRESSION. "GOOLSBEE." ALL RIGHT. TURNS OUT YOU WERE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. ALL RIGHT. WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT HOW DIVIDED OUR COUNTRY IS AND JUST HOW HOSTILE THE OPPOSING PARTIES IN  OUR POLITICAL DEBATE HAVE BECOME AND THE FEAR THESE DIVISIONS ARE SO ENTRENCHED AS TO BE PERMANENT. WELL, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.
SIX-YEAR-OLD LUCY MAGNUM IS THE BRAVE LITTLE GIRL WHO NEARLY LOST HER RIGHT LEG LAST WEEK  AFTER A FIVE-FOOT SHARK ATTACKED HER.
NOW THIS LITTLE GIRL, LITTLE LUCY MAGNUM, SAYS SHE FORGIVES THIS WILD BEAST. LOOK AT THIS.
DID YOU FORGIVE THAT NICE SHARK?
[INAUDIBLE].
SHE SAID, "HE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT."  [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: AND EVEN IF THAT LITTLE GIRL IS, QUITE FRANKLY, WRONG ABOUT THE SHARK... [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT SHARK MEANT TO DO THAT. [LAUGHTER] IF NATURAL ENEMIES LIKE A LITTLE GIRL AND SHARK, WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING, AS YOU KNOW, FOR  CENTURIES -- SOMETIMES THE SHARK WINNING, SOMETIMES THE LITTLE GIRLS WINNING -- IF THEY CAN  FIND FORGIVENESS IN THIS AGE-OLD BATTLE, ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT OUR POLITICAL LEADERS, WHETHER  THEY BE DEMOCRATS, WHETHER THEY BE REPUBLICANS, OH, YES. [LAUGHTER] THAT THEY CAN COME TOGETHER IN A SHARED FEELING OF... NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NO! NOOOOOO! [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHY THE TRUNK WOULD WAGGLE IN THAT KIND OF MANNER. THAT WAS MY FAULT. I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT THE TWO OF THEM IN THE SAME BOX LIKE THAT, BUT MY POINT IS THIS. THE NEWS THAT WASHINGTON HAD COME TO AN AGREEMENT OVER THE RAISING OF A DEBT CEILING HAS  NOT EASED PARTISAN TENSION. EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE LEGISLATION, A SIGNING DONE IN PRIVATE, OR AS SOME MIGHT SAY, "HIDING," I THINK WE STILL HAVE THE AUDIO, THOUGH. CAN WE...
MOTHER [BLEEPED], GOD "THE SLEEP EASY SOLUTION." CRAM IT UP THEIR ASS SIDEWAY, GODDAMN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:, I DON'T KNOW WHY THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED THAT. [LAUGHTER] BUT WHILE THE VICIOUS CHILDISH ALMOST COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY DEBT CEILING BATTLE HAS TAKEN  ITS TOLL ON ALL AMERICANS, THE PROTRACTED NATURE OF THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD ON OUR  SENIOR CITIZENS. WELL, ON ONE SENIOR CITIZEN IN PARTICULAR.
FOR ME PERSONALLY I'VE BEEN HERE FAR LONG TIME. I HAVE A HOME IN NEVADA. AND I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN MONTHS. MY MOM GRANITE TREES ARE, I'M TOLD, BLOSSOMING AND THE POMEGRANATES ON THEM. I HAVE FIG TREES AND ROSES AND STUFF I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOUR POMEGRANATE AND FIG TREES ARE... WHAT ARE YOU, THE SULTAN OF RENO? [LAUGHTER] SOMETIMES THE MYTH OF EUCALYPTUS WOULD SETTLE OVER MY PISTACHIOS AND MY HAREM WOULD PREPARE ME A  PLATE OF CANDIED DATES AND POLISH MY CUP OF SLOT MACHINE TOKENS. STILL, AFTER ALL THE SHOUTING WAS DONE, THE IMPORTANT THING IS WE GOT A DEAL. THE COUNTRY HAS FINALLY GOT ITS SPENDLING AND DEBT UNDER CONTROL.
THIS IS HOW MUCH OUR DEBT WAS GOING TO RISE BEFORE THE COMPROMISE DEAL, NEARLY $29  TRILLION IN TEN YEARS. THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS AFTERWARDS. THE BLACK SHOWS HOW MUCH OF THE OVERSPENDING WILL BE CUT, DOWN TO $26 TRILLION. [AUDIENCE REACTS] [BOOING]
Jon: THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE  [BLEEPED] THING WAS ABOUT? THIS WHOLE BROUHAHA ACCORDING TO DIANE SAWYER'S PARALLELOGRAM OF  DISAPPOINTMENT MANAGED TO REMOVE ONE CHOCOLATE SHAVING FROM OUR DAIRY QUEEN GUT-BUSTER SUNDAE OF DEBT.
THEY'RE CALLING IT THE SUPER COMMITTEE.
IT HAS SUPERPOWERS.
A DOZEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
EVENLY DIVIDE BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
CHARGED WITH FINDING $1.5 TRILLION IN DEFICIT SAVINGS.
A SUPER COMMITTEE.
A SUPER CONGRESS WITH SUPER POWERS.
THE SUPER COMMITTEE DEALS WITH EVERYTHING.
Jon: OUR PRAYERS ARE ANSWERRERED. AMERICA'S OWN LEGION OF DOOFS, BUT WHICH OF OUR LEADERS HAS POWERS FAR ABOVE THOSE OF MORTAL LEGISLATORS. IT MIGHT INCLUDE HARRY REID, AKA THE SENATOR DRONE. HE'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THINGS FOR A LONG TIME. SENATOR JON KYL, THE TRICKLER. HIS GOLDEN STREAM OF PROTECTION SHIELDS THE RICH. I'M SORRY, THE JOB CREATORS. OH, LOOK, IT'S PROFESSOR KVETCH, DROWNING OUT OPPONENTS WITH HIS SUPERSONIC WHINE. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE... SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, OR OLD MAN MAN. BITTEN BY A RADIOACTIVE EVEN OLDER MAN, OLD MAN MAN ALWAYS GETS HIS WAY AND ANY BALLS THAT  HAPPEN THE LAND IN HIS YARD. TOGETHER WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE, THEY ARE THE SUPER COMMITTEE. [LAUGHTER] BUT CAN EVEN THE SUPER COMMITTEE SAVE CONGRESS AT THIS POINT FROM CONGRESS'S ARCHENEMY, THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE?
NEW POLL NUMBERS JUST OUT, LOOKS LIKE THE COUNTRY FEELS LIKE WASHINGTON HAS ACTED LIKE A BUNCH OF SPOILED CHILDREN.
17% BELIEVE THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS ACTED LIKE RESPONSIBLE ADULTS. 77% SAY ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO DEALT WITH THE DEBT CEILING CRISIS HAVE ACTED LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN.
THE POLLSTERS TELL US AMERICANS ARE USING WORDS LIKE "RIDICULOUS," DISGUSTING, STUPID, CHILDISH, DISAPPOINTING AND A JOKE TO DESCRIBE THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES.
Jon: OTHERS MERELY BELCHED OR FARTED INTO THE PHONE. ONE OUTRAGED CITIZEN MAILED IN A DEAD RABBIT. [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE ON PUBLIC SUSPECTMENT TOWARDS WASHINGTON, WE'RE JOINED BY THE BEST [BLEEPED] PUBLIC  MOOD GAUGERS ON TELEVISION. JONES, BEE AND CENAK. LET'S DO THIS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO START WITH YOU. JASON JONES, IN EVERY POLL WE'RE HEARING AMERICANS DESCRIBE CONGRESS IN TERMS LIKE STUPID, CHILDISH, DISGUSTING. YOUR THOUGHTS?
WELL, AMERICANS ARE A FORGIVING BUNCH. I SEE CONGRESS MORE AS A BUNCH OF MONKEYS HIGH-FIVING EACH OTHER IN CELEBRATION, HAVING  FORGOTTEN THAT MERE MOMENTS AGO THEY WERE THROWING THEIR OWN FECES. NOW THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THEY'RE ALL COVERED IN EACH OTHER'S TURDZ.
Jon: SO TO BOIL CONGRESS DOWN TO A WORD?
[BLEEPED] COVERED MONKEYS. ONE WORD. NO SPACES.
I'M SORRY, JON. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK IN HERE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SAM BEE.
I THINK JASON GIVES THEM TOO MUCH CREDIT. EVEN A ROOM FILLED WITH  [BLEEPED] COVERED MONKEYS WOULD EVENTUALLY DESIGN A MORE THOUGHTFUL AND RATIONAL DEFICIT  REDUCTION PLAN THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING. NO, THE EVENTS OF RECENT WEEKS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE WORD. DEIS-SCHMERZEN-MUTTER-TOOBEN.
Jon: DEIS-SCHMERZEN...
IT IS A GERMAN WORD FOR THE SENSE OF DECEMBER SPARE ONE FEELS WATCHING A BELOVED  GRANDPARENT ACCIDENTALLY STRANGLE THEMSELVES WITH A GARDEN HOSE THAT YOU BOUGHT THEM  FOR THEIR 50th WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOW OFTEN DO GERMANS NEED THE USE THAT WORD?
WELL, YOU'D BE SURPRISED. AND THAT SURPRISE IS CALLED SHOCKEN-DOOBLE. OH, GOSH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE.
JON, IF I COULD PLEASE STEP IN.
Jon: WYATT CENAK.
TO CHARACTERIZE CONGRESS AS A BUNCH OF MONKEYS OR A GERMAN EMOTION FAILS TO CAPTURE THE  SENSE OF BETRAYAL AMERICANS FEEL TOWARDS THEIR POLITICIANS. SOME THINGS ARE SO HORRIBLE MERE WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS THEM. JON JON HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP?
WITH THE WONDERFUL LANGUAGE, JON. INTERPRETIVE DANCE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
IF THE MAJORITY WERE SERIOUS ABOUT DEFICIT REDUCTION, THEY WOULD ALLOW REVENUES.
PUT SOMETHING ON THE TABLE.
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE SPEND TOO MUCH.
THE RICH WILL FEEL NO PAIN.
MY POMEGRANATE TREES ARE I'M TOLD BLOSSOMING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'M GOING WITH [BLEEPED]
