Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A FOUNDING  MEMBER OF THE LEGENDARY BAND  PINK FLOYD. HE WILL CONTINUE HIS TOUR THIS  SUMMER IN EUROPE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  ROGER WATERS. I CAN'T HUG YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, ROGER WATERS. COME AND SIT DOWN. I WOULD HUG HIM. HE'S HERE ON A MEDICAL... YOU  GOT A LITTLE BIT OF THE FLU.
KIND OF BIT  Jon: I APPRECIATE YOU COMING  OUT HERE
TO PROJECT TILE VOMIT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU MOVE TO  ONE SIDE.
Jon: WHEN YOU SUGGEST IT, I  WILL MOVE BECAUSE WITH YOUR  ACCENT THAT SOUNDED LOVELY TO  ME.
THANK YOU SO MUCH  Jon: THE WAY THAT... PROCEED  VECTILE VOMIT. IT SOUNDS LIKE I'LL HAVE THAT  AND A SCONE PLEASE
I AM ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR  Jon: YOU DON'T NEED TO BE  I VERY RARELY WEAR A SHIRT AND TIE
Jon: EVERY TIME I SEE ROGER  WATERS, FIRST OF ALL, SEMINAL  ROCK'N'ROLL  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) I STILL AM IN TROUBLE FROM... DO  YOU KNOW IN THE OLD PINK FLOYD  ALBUM YOU HAD THE STICKERS THAT CAME WITH THE ALBUM. PUT THEM UP ALL OVER MY DOOR. STILL THERE.
WE USED TO HAVE VERY GOOD  ADHESIVES IN THOSE DAYS.
Jon: LUCKILY, I STILL LIVE AT  HOME SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU, YOU, THE  ARCHTYPAL REBELLIOUS  ROCK'N'ROLLER ARE JUST OUT THERE DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. YOU'RE OUT THERE AT THE 12-12  BENEFIT FOR SANDY FLOOD RELIEF. YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH  WOUNDED WARRIORS.   ( APPLAUSE )   I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED, THERE  WAS A WOUNDED WARRIOR BENEFIT  WHERE YOU PUT TOGETHER A BAND FROM WALTER REED. TELL ME HOW THAT CAME TO BE
WELL, A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,  BOB WOOD ROUGH ASKED ME TO GO  AND JUST HANG OUT AT THE DRINKS THING BEFORE STAND-UP, WHICH YOU  WERE DOING
Jon: STAND-UP FOR HEROES IN  NEW YORK AT THE BEACON THEATER.
AND BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SNOP  I'M FAMILIAR WITH HIM
I KNOW YOU ARE. I WAS SNOWING BACK STAGE AT YOUR  SHOW HOW VERY, VERY QUICKLY YOU  TALK
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. I DESPERATELY TRY TO KEEP UP  WITH YOU
Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE TO. CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE? ATEROL. DO YOU WANT SOME?
THANK YOU, NO. SO ANYWAY, THEY SAID WILL YOU  COME NEXT YEAR BECAUSE. THEN I HAD THIS WHACKY IDEA  WHICH WAS TO PUT TOGETHER A BAND  OF VETS BACK FROM EITHER AFGHANISTAN OR IRAQ OR WHATEVER  AND MAYBE PUT A BAND TOGETHER. THEY WENT WHAT? AND THEN THEY APPARENTLY SAID  YES. SO I MET THIS LOVELY MAN AT  WALTER REED WHO RUNS A PROGRAM  THERE CALLED MUSIC CALL WHERE THEY TEACH THEM TO PLAY MUSICAL  INSTRUMENTS OR HELP THEM TO  RECOVER THEIR ABILITY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LOST
Jon: RIGHT. TO PLAY AMUSEICAL INSTRUMENT. SO I WENT DOWN TO WALTER REED A  FEW TIMES WITH MY GOOD FRIEND. WE PUT TOGETHER A BAND OF 12  GUYS. THEY WERE AMAZING.
Jon: I MEAN, PEOPLE WERE  BONKERS. THEY WENT BONKERS.
THESE GUYS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.
Jon: YOU DID A GREAT JOB WITH  IT.   ( APPLAUSE )   NOW, YOU'RE GOING BACK ON THE  ROAD WITH THE REMAINING MEMBERS  OF PINK FLOYD, RIGHT? YOU GUYS ARE GOING.
THIS IS HOW HE MAKES HIS  LIVING. THAT IS FUNNY.
Jon: YOU GOT TO POINT CERTAIN  THINGS OUT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO START  WITH ON THE INTERNATIONAL TOUR?
WELL, WE'RE JUST DOING EUROPE  NOW. I THINK I MAY HAVE SQUEEZED BOTH  NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA DRY.
Jon: REALLY? I'VE BEEN HERE ALMOST WITHOUT  PEACE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. IT'S BEEN FABULOUS. WE HAVE A TERRIFIC TIME  PARTICULARLY HERE IN NEW YORK  CITY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELL, NEW YORK CITY IS,  YOU KNOW, WE ARE ENORMOUS FANS  OF WALLS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY. WHETHER IT'S YOUR WALL. WHAT KEEPS IT FRESH FOR YOU  STILL? DO YOU FIND NEW THINGS IN THE  SONGS THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN YEARS  AGO? DO YOU FIND... HOW DO YOU  RECONNECT TO THAT MATERIAL? I KNOW AT 12-12 YOU HAD SOMEONE  ON WHO WAS AMAZING. HOW DO YOU RECONNECT?
THE VERSION OF THE WALL THAT  I'M DOING NOW, IF IT'S FROM THE  ONE THAT I DID WITH PINK FLOYD IN 1979-80 AND THAT IS FAR MORE  UNIVERSAL IN ITS MESSAGE. IT'S NO LONGER ABOUT THAT  MISERABLE SELF-SERVING NASTY  LITTLE ROGER THAT WE ALL HATED THOSE YEARS AGO
Jon: NEVER CRAZY ABOUT HIM. IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU  ACCUSED ME OF WHICH IS THE  REBELLION THAT THE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND HELP  PEOPLE OCCASIONALLY.
Jon: AND THE COMPASSION THAT  YOU DISPLAY IN THOSE PURSUIT
ONCE DOES HAVE EMPATHY FOR  PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TROUBLE.
Jon: YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE MORE  GENEROUS EVEN WITH THE FLU THAN  MANY WILL EVER KNOW. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ROGER WATERS. WE'RE GOING TO LET HIM GO AND  REST UP AND HYDRATE. THE GREAT ROGER WATERS. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
