FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. HAPPY TO BE BACK. OH, I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK. THE TEXAS WAS BEAUTIFUL, WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL TIME IN AUSTIN BUT IT IS SO NICE THAT I REALLY BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE I HAD TO COME HOME. (LAUGHTER) TO POLUTION AND EBOLA. (LAUGHTER) WE HAVE TWO DOCTORS TONIGHT WHO HAVE BEEN, THEY'RE DOWN AT BELLEVUE, THEY'RE IN THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE GENTLEMAN WITH EBOLA IS. AND THEY CAME HERE TONIGHT TO SAY THAT HE'S DOING OKAY AND THAT THEY'RE WORKING HARD. AND THAT I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WASHED THEIR HANDS BEFORE. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S ONE THING YOU REALLY DON'T EXPECT IS TWO GUYS IN SCRUBS TO STAND UP IN YOUR SHOW AND GO OH YEAH, SO WE'RE OVER WITH THE EBOLA GUY. (LAUGHTER) YOU JUST SEE THE AUDIENCE GO--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ANYWAY, TONIGHT WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE, OH, THAT'S MY MIC. YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT? JAKE GYLLENHAAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ONE OF MY TWO FAVORITE GYLLENHAALS. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH TOMORROW! MIDTERM ELECTION DAY. OR AS PEOPLE UNDER 65 CALL IT, HEY, WHY ARE ALL THOSE OLD PEOPLE LINED UP AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014. COME ON REPUBLICANS, JUST GO AHEAD AND TAKE OVER ALREADY! RECENT POLLS INDICATE A BAD NIGHT AHEAD FOR THE DEMOCRATS. WELL, NOT BAD. NOT BAD NECESSARILY. WHAT IS THIS, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT WHEN A HARD RAIN FALLS AND WASHES AWAY ALL THAT THEY'VE EVER WORKED FOR? OH, BUT APPARENTLY IT'S THEIR OWN DAMN FAULT.
WHY WOULD ANYONE VOTE FOR A  DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE. THE ANSWER HE IS EMOTION.
THEY CAN'T ARGUE ON THE ECONOMY. THEY CAN'T ARGUE ON FOREIGN POLICY. THEY CAN'T ARGUE ON THE COMPETENCE OF GOVERNMENT. THEY CAN'T ARGUE REALLY ON ANYTHING.
IT'S REALLY TRUE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RATIONAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOW BEST TO GOVERN, YOU HAVE TO TURN TO THE REPUBLICANS. OUR NATION'S TRUE STATESMEN! (LAUGHTER) THE REPUBLICANS CLOSING ARGUMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THIS QUITE COGENT ILLUMINATING COMPENDIUM OF THEIR MORE ELOQUENT AND UNEMOTIONAL REPOSTS.
EVIL FORCES AROUND THE WORLD WANT TO HARM AMERICANS EVERYDAY.
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE THREATENING TO CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF OUR COUNTRY.
EVERY AMERICAN IS AT RISK. DISEASE, TERRORISM.
THREATS OF TERRORISM, EBOLA.
TERRORISM AND EBOLA.
EBOLA INSIDE THE U.S. VOTE TO KEEP TERRORISTS OFF U.S. SOIL. VOTE REPUBLICAN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WAS A POWERFUL AND COGENT ESSAYISTIC ARGUMENT. MOVE OVER HOPE AND CHANGE AND WELCOME VOTE FOR US OR GET BEHEADED WHILE POOPING BLOOD! (LAUGHTER) DOES THAT HAPPEN? (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SOME MIGHT SAY-- SOME MIGHT SAY IT TAKES A LOT OF BALLS TO SAY YOUR OPPONENT HAS NO GOOD RATIONAL ARGUMENTS WHEN YOUR BEST ARGUMENT APPEARS TO BE REACHING INTO OLDER VOTERS HEADS AND POKING THEIR AMYGDALAS. THE AMYGDALAS, IT'S THE FEAR CENTER. (LAUGHTER) I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID FEAR CENTER. (LAUGHTER) THEN YOU WOULD PROBABLY THINK TO YOURSELF AMYGDALA, BUT THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE THALAMUS'S ROLE. THE POINT IS COME ON, REPUBLICANS, YOU GOT SOMETHING BALSIER?
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK TO A MERCIFUL END.
YOU WANT TWO YEARS LIKE THE LAST FOUR YEARS WHERE WE JUST BUTT HEADS AND BUTT HEADS AND BUTT HEADS?
Jon: YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW I THINK NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WE'RE GOING TO GET BUTTHEADS. (LAUGHTER) BUT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT MITCH McCONNELL, SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL, COME ON, WHO BETTER TO BRING THE GRIDLOCK TO A MERCIFUL END THAN THE GUY WHO HAS BEEN BLOCKING THE BOX FOR SIX YEARS.
ARE YOU TRYING TO GET BY? (LAUGHTER) SO LET'S JUST SAY THE GOP'S MESSAGE OF CIVIC OPTIMISM DOESN'T RESONATE. LET'S SAY THE VOTERS DON'T TAKE TO IT. WHAT'S THE BACKUP PLAN. TO GET THE REPUBLICANS THE POWER THEY SO DESPERATELY WILL ONLY GOVERN WHEN THEY HAVE.
TEXAS'S TOUGH VOTER I.D. LAW WILL BE IN FULL FORCE FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.
THE LAW COULD PREVENT MORE THAN 600,000 REGISTERED VOTERS IN TEXAS FROM VOTING IN PERSON.
MORE THAN 400,000 ELIGIBLE VOTERS WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL THREE HOURS OR MORE TO THE NEAREST GOVERNMENT OFFICE ISSUING I.D.s.
AH YES, THE PARTY THAT NEVER MET A GUN PURCHASE RESTRICTION THEY THOUGHT WAS NOT ONEROUS WANTS TO MAKE SURE NO ONE EVER WALKS INTO A SCHOOL AND UNLAERBS A WANTON SPRAY OF BALLOTS. NOW BEAR IN MIND--  (LAUGHTER)  I GOT -- I GOT MY PEN BACK. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BEAR IN MIND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEXAS. THE DEREGULATION CAPITOL OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. THE STATE WHOSE OFFICIAL STATE SYMBOL IS THE UNINSPECTED EXPLODING CHEMICAL PLANT. I IMAGINE TO GET TEXAS ON THE VOTER REGULATION TRAIN, WELL THEY HAVE GOT TO HAVE A PRETTY SERIOUS PROBLEM DOWN THERE.
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN TWO PROVEN CASES OF VOTER FRAUD IN THE PAST DECADE IN TEXAS.
SINCE 2002, OF THE MILLIONS OF VOTES CAST IN TEXAS DURING THAT PERIOD,-- .
Jon: ACTUALLY 20 MILLION VOTES, I WAS JUST CALCULATING IT. 20 MILLION VOTES WERE CAST AND TWO OF THEM WERE PROVEN FRAUDULENT, SO THAT'S .1 PARTS PER MILLION. OR LESS THAN HOW MUCH COCKROACH WE ALLOW IN OUR YOGURT. AND -- NO THAT -- (APPLAUSE) THAT HAPPENS TO BE COCKROACH AND HONEY YOGURT. TEXAS IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL REPUBLICAN LED STATES THAT SET STRONGER VOTER RESTRICTION AFTER THE SUPREME COURT GUTTED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. MUST HAVE BEEN A COINCIDENCE. LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. WHICH IS RISKING ITS REPUTATION AS THE LESS [BLEEP] CAROLINA.
THE NEW VOTER LAW INCLUDES A PHOTO I.D. REQUIREMENT. A BAN ON SAME-DAY REGISTRATION. NO OUT OF PRECINCT VOTING, AND A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF EARLY VOTING DAYS. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THERE'S BEEN A FLURRY OF COURT APPEALS AND DECISIONS WHICH FIRST UPHELD THEN REVERSED, THEN UPHELD AGAIN THE NEW REQUIREMENTS.
THANKS FOR THAT REPORT, KELLY. OH, YES, THEY UPHELD, THEY UNHELD NORTH CAROLINA'S FAMOUSLY INDECISIVE COURTS, WE FIND THE DEFENDENT GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, OH [BLEEP] IT, KILL HIM. (APPLAUSE) LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS, FAR BE IT FROM ME TO QUESTION ANYONE'S MOTIVES. BUT COME ON A LOT OF THESE LAWS SMELL PRETTY VOTER SUPPRESSION-Y.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KINDS OF I.D. THAT CAN BE USED IN TEXAS, YOU CAN USE YOUR GUN REGISTRATION BUT YOU CANNOT USE YOUR COLLEGE VOTER I.D..
Jon: THAT ONE IS PRETTY EASY TO EXPLAIN. WITHOUT A GUN REGISTRATION, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO OPPERATE A TEXAS VOTING BOOTH? YEAH -- THAT'S UH -- YOU'VE GOT TO --
THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, NONPARTISAN RESEARCH, FOUND THAT A STUDY OF VOTER I.D. LAWS THAT IT ACTUALLY LOWERED THE TURNOUT IN TENNESSEE AND KANSAS TWO STATES STUDIED AMONG MINORITY VOTERS AND YOUNGER VOTERS.
Jon: THE YOUNG AND THE BROWN. IF ONLY THEY COULD FIND A WAY TO GET WOMEN ON THERE THEY WOULD NULLIFY THE DEMOCRATS TRIPLE CROWN.
WOMEN CHANGE THEIR NAMES MORE OFTEN THAN MEN WHEN THEY MARRY OR DIVORCE MAKING IT MORE OF A CHALLENGE TO CARRY I.D. OR PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP IN THEIR CURRENT LEGAL NAME.
THERE YOU HAVE IT. ONEROUS LAWS TO PREVENT NONEXISTENT FRAUD THAT HAPPENS TO TILT THE ELECTIONS IN FAVOR OF THE RATIONAL ARGUMENT FOR GOVERNANCE REPUBLICANS NEVER ACTUALLY MADE ALL PRESENTED WITH THE HIGHEST OF IDEALS.
ONE PERSON GETS ONE VOTE, NOT TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE.
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE ABUSING THE SACRED RIGHT OF VOTING.
I DON'T WANT DEAD PEOPLE VOTING IN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
Jon: WELL THEN MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T SCHEDULE ELECTIONS RIGHT AFTER HALLOWEEN. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
