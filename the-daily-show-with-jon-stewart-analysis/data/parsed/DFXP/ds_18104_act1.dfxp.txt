COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH  JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. OH, DO WE HAVE A SHOW FOR  YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST, MY GUEST TONIGHT  GEORGE PACKER, HE IS AUTHOR  OF "THE UNWINDING" THE  NONVISION FICTION BOOK ABOUT AMERICA ON THE VERGE OF  DYSTOPIAN COULD LAPTS. -- COLLAPSE. (LAUGHTER)  I HOPE THEY HAVE-- BUT FIRST  IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY  THAT BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA BEGAN HIS SECOND TERM AS  PRESIDENT WITH HIGH HOPES. BUT NOW JUST FOUR MONTHS  LATER HE FINDS HIMSELF MIRED  IN AN INDEX CASEABLE  DOWNWARD FALL WHERE THE ONLY CONGRESSIONAL ACTION CAN  COUNT ON IS PUNITIVE IN  NATURE. HE HAS ENTERED INTO A THREE  AND A HALF YEAR RACE OF [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)  HIS ONLY HOPE, THE MEDIA. (LAUGHTER)  WITH THE ATTENTION SPAN OF A  CONCUSSED GOLDFISH. MORE OF A PROBLEM THAN WOULD  YOU THINK FOR GOLDFISH. IT'S NOT THE BOWL AS MUCH AS  SOMETIMES THE THRESHURE  CHEST THEY CAN RUN INTO.
THE RACE FOR 2016 ALREADY  HEATING UP.
THE RACE FOR 2016.
12016.
2016.
2016.
FAST APPROACHING.
THERE'S STILL ALMOST A  THOUSAND DAYS BEFORE THE  FIRST VOTE IN THE 2016  CONTEST.
Jon: SQUIRREL! SQUIRREL! YES, A THOUSAND DAYS UNTIL  THE FIRST PRIMARY VOTES AND  WHILE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, THEY'RE PRETTY SURE THEY  KNOW WHAT WILL.
MARCO RUBIO'S MULTIMEDIA  APPEARANCES THIS WEEKEND  FUELING MORE SPECULATION HE'S CONSIDERING A RUN FOR  PRESIDENT IN 2016.
LOTS OF BUZZ ABOUT TED  CRUZ RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
HILLARY CURRENT TON IS  THE ODDS ON FAVORITE TO  BECOME THE DEMOCRATIC  NOMINEE.
Jon: WOW. SO 1,000 DAYS BEFORE THE  FIRST PRIMARY WITH ZERO  STATES REPORTING OR CARING. I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE  CALLING THE DEMOCRATIC  PRIMARY FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SHE'S THE WINNER, HILLARY  RODHAM CLINTON. IT IS CLINTON'S SECOND  VICTORY. IT'S HER SECOND VICTORY IN  THE RIDICULOUSLY PREMATURE  DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.
HILL ROE CLINTON WILL BE  THE NOMINEE OF THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SHE WILL CRUSH BARACK OBAMA. SHE-- BARACK JUST SIT IT  OUT. IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY, I  PROMISE YOU, YOU HEARD IT  HERE FIRST.
Jon: AND THE REST WAS  ALTERNATE HISTORY. I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING  ABOUT THIS OBAMA PRESIDENCY,  HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT, IT HAS FOREVER CHANGED THE  EXPECTATION OF WHAT AN  AMERICAN PRESIDENT CAN LOOK  LIKE.
FOR MY GENERATION BUT FOR  MY KIDS, BY THE TIME THEY  ARE ABLE TO VOTE THE IDEA OF A BLACK PRESIDENT WILL BE  ALMOST PASSE T WILL BE  SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY  OBVIOUSLY THAT CAN HAPPEN, A LATINO PRESIDENT, A WOMAN.
THERE WILL BE A FIRST  LATINO PRESIDENT OR LATINA  PRESIDENT. THERE WILL BE A FIRST GAY  PRESIDENT.
Jon: WELL, OPENLY GAY. (LAUGHTER)  GAY. I THINK WE JUST CHOSE LIKE  FIVE RANDOM PRESIDENTS. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, IT'S A NUMBERS  GAME, REALLY. NOW FOR FANS OF THE  TRADITIONAL AMERICAN  PRESIDENCY DON'T WORRY. THERE IS STILL ONE OR TWO  OLD WHITE FELLAS ON THE  MENU. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN  MAYBE CONSIDERING A  PRESIDENTIAL BID OF HIS OWN.
DON'T MISS THE INTERVIEWS  UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE IN KROTS  LIKE THIS ONE. QUOTE, I JUST HAD LUNCH WITH  THE PRESIDENT. I SPENT AN AVERAGE OF 4 TO 5  HOURS A DAY WITH HIM, EVERY  SINGLE DAY. WHEN I SPEAK NO ONE DOUBTS  THAT I SPEAK FOR THE  PRESIDENT. LIGHT RALLY EVERY MEETING HE  HAS I'M IN. (LAUGHTER)  DID JUST READ LITERALLY AS  WHITE RALLY? (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SAY  ON LIVE TV LIKE IF YOU DID  THAT'S AWESOME. I'M SORRY SAW-SO-ME. (LAUGHTER)  SORRY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO  TAKE THAT KIND OF-- FROM A  STUPID-- COMEDIAN. FOR MORE ON THE BATCH OF  2016 CANDIDATES WE'RE JOINED  BY LARRY WILMORE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE  HAVE BEEN SEE ON THE AIR. HAS THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY  OPENED THE DOOR TO THE OVAL  OFFICE TO OTHER TYPES WE  HAVEN'T SEEN AS PRESIDENT  BEFORE? WOMEN, OTHER MINORITIES?
JON, SURE, EVENTUALLY. BUT YOU KNOW, LET'S SLOW  DOWN A SECOND, EVERYBODY. LATINOS, WOMEN, GAYS, WE'RE  NOT QUITE DONE WITH IT YET.
Jon: RIGHT. YOU MEAN BLACK PEOPLE  BECAUSE THE TERM ENDS AFTER  2016 AND --
THAT'S RIGHT. BUT THE FIRST BLACK GUY'S  TURN. LET'S NOT BE HASTY, JON. LOOK, WHEN JACKIE ROBINSON  BROKE THE COLOURED BARRIER  IN BUSINESS BALL BLACK  PEOPLE DIDN'T JUST GET ONE AT-BAT AND WE'RE DONE. JACKIE PAVED THE WAY FOR  BILLIE-- WILLIE AND HANK AND  SKINNY, JELLY ROLL,  GENTLEMAN DAVE, PLUNK,  CHINO.
Jon: REALLY, PLUNK.
ACTUAL PLAYER, LOOK HIM  UP, BLACKIPEDIA.
Jon: BLACKIPEDIA? IS THERE A BLACKIPEDIA?
THERE IS.
Jon: OR THERE WILL BE  NOW. SO WAIT, SO YOU'RE SAY  NOTHING LATINO PRESIDENT OR  A WOMAN PRESIDENT.
NO, NO. A BLACK LATINO WOULD BE  FINE.
Jon: I IMAGINE ALSO A  BLACK WOMAN.
YEAH BUT A STRONG BLACK  WOMAN WITH A STRONG BLACK  WOMAN NAME, YOU KNOW, LIKE KOCHBD LEEZA ON QUVENZHANE,  SOMETHING THAT SAYS YEAH I'M  THE PRESIDENT BUT I COULD ALSO BE A PERFUME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO ANY ETHNICITY.
AS LONG AS THEY'RE BLACK.
Jon: FOR HOW LONG? LARRY, HOW LONG DOES THE RUN  OF BLACK PRESIDENTS HAVE TO  GO? I MEAN DO YOU THINK A  DEMOCRACY CAN SURVIVE WITH  THE SAME RACE DOMINATING THE  WHITE HOUSE FOR YEARS ON END OVER AND OVER AGAIN? I MEAN IS THAT-- THE-- NOW  THAT I HEAR THAT OUTLOUD I  REALIZE --
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: I SUPPOSE WHITE GUYS  DID HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RUN.
GOOD RUN? JON, YOU HAD 43 OUT OF 44.
Jon: WELL, 43 AND A HALF,  REALLY, I MEAN IF YOU ARE'S  ARE'S-- [BLEEP].
THAT'S RIGHT. NICE, JON.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M  SAYING.
EVEN BETTER. JON, YOU GUYS ROCKED IT,  MANMENT AND NOW IT'S OUR  TURN. LOOK, WE WANT TO RUN WITH  THE SAME DIVERSITY OF BLACK  PRESIDENTS THAT YOU HAD WITH WHITE PRESIDENTS.
Jon: THAT ALMOST MADE  SENSE.
JON, OBAMA BLACK, COOL,  INTLRL, WOODROW WILL  INTERNATIONAL BLACK  PRESIDENT. WE STILL NEED A WAR HERO  BLACK PRESIDENT, AN EX-MOVIE  STAR BLACK PRESIDENT, A  PEANUT FARMER BLACK  PRESIDENT.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU  SOMETHING, CARTER LOOKED  ACTUALLY KIND OF NICE WITH THE CORN ROWS.
JON, THOSE ARE PEANUT  ROWS RZ ARE THEY PEANUT  ROWS.
THEY ARE.
Stephen: HOW ABOUT A  BLACK SLAFT PRESIDENT.
LIKE TAFT, WE HAVE TO  HAVE A BLACK TAFT, A BLAFT.
Jon: YEAH!
THAT BLAFT WAS A BAD  MOTHA.
Jon: SHUT YO MOUTH.
I'M TALKING ABOUT BLAFT.
Jon: I CAN DIG IT.
BLAFT LAM-- .
Jon: THE BOTTOM LINE.
THAT'S MY LINE, JON.
Jon: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S OKAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M SORRY.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, THAT'S  OKAY, JON. WE'RE HAVING FUN. LET'S GO WITH IT.
Jon: I WAS THROWN BACK  INTO RICHARD ROUNDTREE MODE.
THREATS LET'S DO BLAFT  AGAIN.
BLAFT!
IT'S STILL OUR TURN, THE  PRESIDENCY IS LIKE THE RING. IT'S THE PRECIOUS. EXCUSE ME, SORRY, IT'S THE  PRECIOUS, BASED ON THE NOVEL  PUSH BY SAPPHIRE, WE'RE NOT READY TO GIVE UP THAT KIND  OF POWER. YOU KNOW, COME JUNE 10th  WHEN JOHN OLIVER IS SITTING  IN THAT CHAIR WILL KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: COME ON, HE'S JUST  HERE UNTIL I GET BACK, JUST  A FEW WEEKS IN THE  SUMMERTIME. (LAUGHTER)
INTERNET'S RIGHT. YOU ARE FUNNY, JON.
Jon: THANK YOU, LARRY,  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK IS THAT  TRUE?
