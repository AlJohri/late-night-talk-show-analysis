Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, I AM RANDY WEBER... [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, THE STRENGTH OF OUR MILITARY IS THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE IN IT. THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY, AND BLACK WOMEN HAVE HAIR. NOW, THOSE TWO THINGS MAY NOT SEEM CONNECTED TO YOU, BUT JESSICA WILLIAMS EXPLAINS.
THE U.S. ARMY RECENTLY RELEASED A NEW SET OF UNIFORM REGULATIONS, AR670-1, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT OPTIONS FOR BLACK WOMEN'S HAIRSTYLES, PROMPTING ONE BLACK SERVICE WOMAN TO RESPOND, OH, NO, THEY DIDN'T, IN THE FORM OF A WHITEHOUSE.GOV PETITION WHICH RECEIVED OVER 17,000 SIGNATURES. SERGEANT JASMINE JACOBS.
THE NEW REGULATIONS ARE BASICALLY STATING THAT THE CURRENT HAIRSTYLES FOR BLACK FEMALES ARE NOW UNAUTHORIZED, SUCH AS TWO-STRAND TWIST, NEATLY KEPT DREADLOCKS, FLAT TWIST AND BASICALLY ALMOST ANY NATURAL HAIRSTYLE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. OKAY. OKAY. WAIT. WE'RE THROWING AROUND A LOT OF WORDS HERE. LET'S TAKE A SECOND AND LET THE WHITE PEOPLE CATCH UP. [LAUGHTER] OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO CATCH UP. WHITE PEOPLE, THESE ARE THE HAIRSTYLES THE ARMY HAS BANNED.
TWO-STRAND TWIST.
TWISTS ARE JUST TWISTED HAIR.
NEATLY KEPT DREADLOCKS.
THAT'S WHEN BLACK HAIR LOCKS TOGETHER.
BASICALLY ALMOST ANY NATURAL HAIRSTYLE.
NATURAL MEANS HOW OUR HAIR NATURALLY GROWS, CRAZY, RIGHT? AND THESE ARE THE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT HAIRSTYLES THE ARMY ALLOWS, CHEMICALLY STRAIGHTENED HAIR THAT BURNS LIKE HELL, WEAVES THAT ARE SEWN ONTO YOUR HEAD, MICROBRAIDS THAT TAKE FOREVER, WIGS, YEAH, WIGS, AND CORN ROWS. PSHT, I'VE SEEN YOU GUYS AT MYRTLE BEACH. YOU KNOW WHAT CORN ROWS ARE. BASICALLY THE ONLY HAIRSTYLES THE ARMY ALLOWS COST A TON OF MONEY AND PUT YOUR ASS IN A SALON FOR HOURS. NOW THAT THE WHITE PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT UP, LET'S CONTINUE.
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE REGULATIONS, I DEFINITELY WAS IN A PANIC. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH MY HAIR.
RIGHT. YOU WERE PROBABLY STRESSED BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANT TO LOOK FLY, RIGHT?
WELL, NO. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH LOOKING FLY, ACTUALLY. YOU HAVE TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR MISSION. THE HAIRSTYLES THAT WE'RE LEFT WITH ARE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND, HONESTLY, GET IN THE WAY OF YOU DOING YOUR JOB PROPERLY.
BUT SOME PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY THINK SERGEANT JACOBS HAS STEPPED OUT OF LINE, LIKE FORMER LIEUTENANT COMMANDER THOMAS CHEEVER. AND HE'S GOT SOME MUCH-NEED ADVICE FOR BLACK SERVICE WOMEN.
SOLDIER, IT'S TIME TO SUCK IT UP. THEY'RE CALLED UNIFORM REGULATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING PEOPLE LOOK UNIFORM.
OF COURSE, EVERYONE IN THE ARMY SHOULD LOOK THE SAME, WHETHER YOU LOOK LIKE, TO TAKE TWO TOTALLY RANDOM EXAMPLES, WILFORD BRIMLEY OR BEYONCE'S PRETTIER SISTER.
BUT ALSO, THERE ARE SAFETY ISSUES IN THAT WHETHER IT BE KEVLAR HELMETS, WHETHER IT BE A GAS MASK, WHETHER IT BE AN OXYGEN MASK FOR AN AVIATOR AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE, MUST FIT PROPERLY.
SO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT ON A GAS MASK?
YES.
LIKE THIS?
YES.
AND YOU NEED TO HAVE AN APPROVED HAIRSTYLE?
CORRECT.
LIKE A WIG, LIKE THIS? WELL, LET'S TRY TO PUT THIS ON AND THIS ON RIGHT NOW AND SEE HOW IT FEELS. GO AHEAD.
PRESUMABLY THE WIG WOULD ALREADY BE ON. OKAY, WELL, THAT'S MINUS ONE DEMERIT. MEETING A WHITE STANDARD OF BEAUTY CAN GIVE YOU A THREE STOOGES STANDARD OF COMBAT READINESS. HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
IT FEELS TERRIBLE.
NOW, WAS THAT BATTLE READY HAIR?
NO.
SO WHY CHANGE THE REGULATIONS NOW? IT'S FUNNY, BACK WHEN THE ARMY WAS FIGHTING TWO WARS, THEY NEEDED BLACK WOMEN. BUT NOW THEY CAN SUDDENTLY AFFORD TO BE A LITTLE PICKIER.
THESE NEW REGULATIONS COULD DEFINITELY DETER BLACK FEMALES FROM JOINING THE MILITARY BECAUSE IT'S WAS LIKE, YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH TO GO TO IRAQ AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE RISK YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO WEAR YOUR HAIR THE WAY IT NATURALLY GROWS OUT OF YOUR HAIR.
WELL, WHAT IF THE ARMY RECOGNIZED HOW PAINFUL HAIR RELAXERS ARE AND THEN REWARDED YOU WITH A MEDAL? GREAT HAIR, SERGEANT JAMES. WE'RE AWARDING YOU WITH A PURPLE SCALP?
UM, I DON'T WANT A PURPLE SCALP. I THINK THEY REALLY NEED TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF BLACK HAIR. THEY'RE NOT AWARE AND PROBABLY DIDN'T FEEL A NEED TO GO FIND OUT ABOUT IT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED? SOMEONE TO EDUCATE AND INSPIRE NOT JUST THE MILITARY BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. SOMEONE WHO CAN RAISE AWARENESS.
RIGHT. THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING DO WITH MY PETITION.
NO, NOT YOU, SOMEBODY WITH MAGNETIC PERSONALITY, A TALENTED TV PERSON. LUCKILY I KNEW JUST THE PERSON. IT WAS GO TIME. COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. IN AN ARMY WITHOUT A LOT OF PISSED-OFF BLACK LADIES. LET'S GO. LET'S COMMENCE WITH OPERATION BLACK HAIR. OILS, SERUMS, POMADES, THESE ARE TOOLS OF THE TRADE, THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW. A RECON MISSION TO UNCOVER JUST WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE BLACK HAIR ARMY READY.
I NEED DO YOU TALK TO HIM ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS AND DON'T SAY IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NATIVE AMERICAN GRANDMA. HOT COMB. KNOW IT. RESPECT IT.
WHAT THIS IS, IT'S EXTENSION, HAIR EXTENSIONS.
DOES IT HURT?
DOES IT HURT?
YEAH, YEAH, IT HURTS.
THIS IS RELAXER. IT WILL LAY YOUR [BLEEPED] OUT. YOU'RE GOING TO SIT HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH HER GET HER BRAIDS DONE. IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOUR HOURS. OKAY. DON'T LOOK AT ME. EYES ON TARGET. THIS ISN'T A 20-MINUTE TACTICAL CREWCUT. THIS IS BOOTS ON THE GROUND, HANDS IN THE HAIR, ALL DAMN DAY. BUT WAS THIS WORKING? WHAT IS THIS?
RELAXER.
WHAT DOES IT DO?
LAY YOUR [BLEEPED] OUT.
YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME TODAY.
YES, MA'AM. I'M WEARING A BLIND FOLD, NOT EARPLUGS. PLEASE.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. ONE WHITE GUY IS PROBABLY CONVINCED. BUT I COULDN'T STOP THERE. I HAD TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE OF INSPIRATION TO THE ENTIRE NATION. I HAVE A WEAVE. I HAVE A WEAVE THAT WE BE JUDGE NOT BY WHAT GROWS OUT OF OUR HEAD BUT BY THE CONTENTS WITHIN IT. I HAVE BEEN TO THE BEAUTY SHOP. DAMN, YOU STILL NOT DONE WITH THEM BRAIDS? [BLEEPED]. [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. VERY NICE.
