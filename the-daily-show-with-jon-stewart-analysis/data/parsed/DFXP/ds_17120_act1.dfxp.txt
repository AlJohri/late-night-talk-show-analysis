Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, LORDY, LORDY, LORDY, WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST: SETH McFARLANE, THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND "FAMILY GUY."  LET ME JUST SAY THIS, IF YOU SEE ONE MOVIE THIS SUMMER WHERE A TEDDY BEAR USES A URINAL, MAKE  IT "TED." (LAUGHTER) WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH FAST AND FURIOUS, A SCANDAL WHICH AS  YOU'LL RECALL FAST AND FURIOUS WAS A PROGRAM WHERE WE ALLOWED UNTRACKABLE GUNS TO BE SENT TO  MEXICO IN AN EFFORT TO TRACK... (LAUGHTER). ... GUNS GOING TO... IT'S THE ZANIEST SOUTH OF THE BORDER  MIXUP SINCE "THE THREE AMIGOS." (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THIS SEGMENT BROUGHT  TO YOU BY "THE THREE AMIGOS. THE THREE AMIGOS." BECAUSE TWO AMIGOS WOULD HAVE BEEN A STUPID (BLEEP)ING MOVIE. (LAUGHTER) THERE WERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PUNCH LINES TO THAT ONE. LAST WEEK BROUGHT A TROUBLING NEW DEVELOPMENT TO THE FAST AND FURIOUS STORY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME ASSERTED EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO SHIELD JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS DEALING WITH WHAT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE FAST AND FURIOUS SCANDAL.
Jon: SO THERE IT IS! AN A.T.F. PROGRAM, DISASTROUS AND DEADLY RESULTS, STATEMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  THAT DON'T MATCH WITH PREVIOUS STATEMENTS. AND BARACK OBAMA'S FIRST INNOVATION OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. THE WHITE HOUSE ON ITS HEELS. IT LOOKS BAD. IT IS BAD. REPUBLICANS WERE QUICK TO POUNCE.
THE DEBATE OVER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE  PRIVILEGE IF FAST AND FURIOUS CARRIES ECHOES OF WATERGATE.
I THINK HE'S MADE THIS AS BIG AS WATERGATE.
BIGGER THAN WATERGATE.
WATERGATE-LIKE ENVIRONMENT.
RICHARD NIXON WALKING AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE WITH A DRINK IN  HIS HAND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THE WATERGATE TAPES AWAY FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WATERGATE LOOKS LIKE CHILD'S PLAY COMPARED TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: CHILD'S PLAY! IT'S CHILD'S PLAY. FAST AND FURIOUS WOULD BE LIKE IF MONICA LEWINSKY WENT DOWN ON IRAN-CONTRA DURING THE BAY OF  PIGS INVASION! DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS? (LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE, GET ME BRUCKHEIMER! THAT WILL MAKE A COOL MOVIE. ANYWAY, THERE'S ONLY TWO PROBLEMS WITH FAST AND FURIOUS BEING OBAMA'S WATERGATE. I'LL LET GOVERNOR RICK PERRY EXPLAIN PROBLEM NUMBER ONE.
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT: THIS IS ALMOST NIXONIAN IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NIXONIAN IN THE  COVERUP THAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS FAST AND FURIOUS.
KPA EXACTLY ARE YOU ACCUSING THE PRESIDENT OF HERE, GOVERNOR?
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, THAT'S THE ISSUE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHAT'S SO NIXONIAN ABOUT IT! I DON'T KNOW! YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER HOW A CAUTIOUS GOVERNOR LIKE THIS ENDS UP EXECUTING SO MANY PEOPLE. REALLY. (LAUGHTER) I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY'S MANSONNIAN. I'M SAYING IT. IT'S O.J. SIMPSONIAN. I DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW I JUST CAN TELL! (LAUGHTER) AND THE SECOND PROBLEM, WHILE THE REPUBLICANSst WOULD LIKE  OUR -R OUR OUTRAGE AT THE FAST AND FURIOUS SCANDAL TO REACH THE LEVELS IT REACHED DURING  WATERGATE, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE ASKED US TO GO THERE.
THIS PATTERN OF LEAKS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, OF GRAVE NATIONAL SECURITY LEAKS IS  VASTLY MORE SERIOUS THAN WHAT HAPPENED AT WATERGATE.
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THIS SOLYNDRA DEAL.
THIS MAKES WATERGATE LOOK LIKE CHILD'S PLAY MEGYN.
THE WHITE HOUSE IN A PERCEPTION BATTLE TRYING TO TAMP DOWN THE RHETORIC LINKING THE  GULF OIL SPILL TO HURRICANE KATRINA.
NOT ONLY COULD THIS BE OBAMA'S KATRINA AND IT'S NOT  KATRINA YET BUT IT COULD ALSO BE OBAMA'S WATERGATE. >>WATERGATE.
Jon: THAT'S FOUR WATERGATES! (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A RECORD NUMBER OF WATERGATES! PASSING THE PREVIOUS WATERGATE RECORD HOLDER, A RICHARD NIXON... (LAUGHTER). WITH ONE! THEY THROW AROUND THE TERM "WATERGATE" SO MUCH AT FOX YOU THINK THE GUY RUNNING FOX HAD  BEEN A NIXON OPERATIVE IN THE... OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD! IT'S WATERGATE-GATE. GATE-GATE. IT'S A LOT OF GATES! SEE, THE PROBLEM HERE IS YOU'VE BECOME THE FOX WHO CRIES WOLF. YOUR OUTRAGE REPERTOIRE HAS BEEN SO OVERUSED AS TO RENDER JUSTIFIED OUTRAGE MEANINGLESS. "THIS IS WATERGATE!" RIGHT. AND WHAT WAS IT WHEN SECOND GRADERS SANG A SONG ABOUT OBAMA IN THEIR CLASSROOM? â™ª BARACK HAOUS SANE OBAMA.
Jon: THEY SAY IT'S IN *R INDOCTRINE NATION.
I THOUGHT THIS IS INDOCTRINE NATION STRAIGHT UP.
DOESN'T IT REMIND YOU OF ANY DICTATOR WITH W THE INDOCTRINE NATION OF KIDS? THIS IS PURE KHMER ROUGE STUFF. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: KHMER ROUGE STUFF. YES, WHO CAN FORGET THE KHMER ROUGE AND THE DREADED SINGING FEEDS OF CAMBODIA. (LAUGHTER) THEY FORCED CHILDREN TO SING! (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, KHMER ROUGE IS WORSE THAN WATERGATE SO IF THOSE KIDS  SINGING IS THE KHMER ROUGE, FAST AND FURIOUS HAS GOT TO BE THE DEATH STAR TAKING OUT ALDERAAN  JUST TO MAINTAIN YOUR OUTRAGE EXCHANGE RATE. NOT TO MENTION THE BREATHLESSNESS. OH, THE BREATHLESSNESS OVER BARACK OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS ENGAGED IN CHRONIC CONSTITUTIONAL ABUSE.
INCREASING LAWLESSNESS I'LL CALL IT OF PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IT'S YET ANOTHER UNCONSTITUTIONAL POWER GRAB BY THIS ADMINISTRATION.
THIS PRESIDENT IS THUMBING HIS NOSE AT THE CONSTITUTION.
THIS IS OUT AND OUT LAWLESSNESS. THE DICTATOR'S WET DREAM. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, RUSH. IF YOU'RE A DICTATOR AND YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH SEMEN LEFT OVER AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR A  NOCTURNAL EMISSION, YOU'RE NOT A VERY GOOD DICTATOR. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) RUSH LIMBAUGH AND SEMEN IN THE SAME IMAGE IS JUST NOT... LAWLESS DICTATORSHIP. FAST AND FURIOUS I THINK IS BAD, BUT LAWLESS DICTATORSHIP. ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING? EXECUTIVE ACTION GIVING REPUBLICAN IT IS VAPORS. REMEMBER THIS GUY?
SO I GOT A LITTLE FRUSTRATED IN WASHINGTON BECAUSE I COULDN'T  GET THE BILL PASSED OUT OF THE CONGRESS. THEY WERE ARGUING PROCESS. CONGRESS WOULDN'T ACT SO I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT MEANS I DID IT ON MY OWN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. (LAUGHTER) BUT DID YOU HEAR THAT? DID YOU HEAR THAT SOUND? (CLAPS) WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT SOUND IS? IS THAT REPUBLICANS JUST TRYING TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION TO HAVE THAT GUY ARRESTED? I DON'T THINK SO. "OFFICER, THERE'S A LAWLESS WATERGATEER BEING LAWLESS WITH THE TYRANNY. HERE COMES THE WET DREAM!" THAT'S APPLAUSE, ACCEPTANCE, EXCITEMENT. I'M TROUBLED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF EXECUTIVE POWER, SO MAYBE I'M  NOT THE BEST GUY TO MAKE A DEFENSE OF THIS. I MEAN, WHO WOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO DEFEND THIS KIND OF EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE.
THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE HERE IN TERMS OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE  ABILITY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT HAVING ANYBODY, FOR EXAMPLE, TO BE ABLE  TO GO TO COURT AND GET A JUDGE TO DIRECT DISCOVERY SO THAT THEY CAN PORE THROUGH ALL OF THE  PAPERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND, IN EFFECT, INHIBIT THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
Jon: I FEEL COLD. (LAUGHTER) SO COLD. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW WITH OBAMA, Y'ALL GOTTA HAVE THE INFORMATION. AND YOU CAN'T EVEN KEEP YOUR JUSTIFYCATION FOR WANTING THE INFORMATION UNDER CONTROL. HERE'S THE GUY HEADING UP THE FAST AND FURIOUS INVESTIGATION, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE.
HE NEVER ANSWERED THE QUESTION. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING OF? COULD IT BE WHAT THEY WERE REALLY THINKING OF WAS, IN FACT, TO USE THIS WALKING OF GUNS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN? MANY THINK SO AND THEY HAVEN'T COME UP WITH AN EXPLANATION THAT WOULD CAUSE ANY OF US NOT TO AGREE.
Jon: SO THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR EXPLANATION FOR THIS UNBELIEVABLY STUPID GUN PROGRAM  THAT MIRRORED ONLY A SLIGHTLYLESS UNBELIEVELIBLY STUPID ONE THAT BEGAN DURING THE  BUSH YEARS IS EVIDENCE OF A LARGER CONSPIRACY TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS? ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT EVIDENCE THAT OBAMA IS JUST ARMING MEXICO SO THEY CAN LEAD HIM TO RETAKE  THE ALAMO? DO YOU THINK IT'S THAT? (LAUGHTER) MAYBE HE'S USING THE WEAPONS TO WEIGH MEXICO DOWN, SINKING IT. (LAUGHTER) THUS CREATING ACRES OF NEW BEACH FRONT PROPERTY TO SOIL WITH AN OIL SPILL! (LAUGHTER) OBAMA'S GIVEN NO EXPLANATION THAT WOULD MAKE ME BELIEVE  OTHERWISE SO I'M INCLINED TO GO WITH IT. IF THAT'S THE CASE, THOUGH, WHAT DID Y'ALL THINK OF THE BUSH YEARS SHENANIGANS? SECRET TORTURE PROGRAMS, WIRETAPPING CITIZENS WITHOUT A WARRANT, PUTTING SIGNED STATEMENTS ON TO LAWS THAT  NEGATED WHAT THE LAW SAYS, STONEWALLING CONGRESS, HOLDING AMERICANS WITHOUT TRIAL BY CALLING THEM ENEMY COMBATANTS. WHAT WAS YOUR WORKING THEORY ON THE TYRANNY AND LAWLESSNESS OF THOSE SECRET PROGRAMS?
DO YOU FEEL THAT IT IS IN THE PUBLIC'S BEST INTEREST TO KNOW  WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES SECRET STUFF? THAT REALLY PROTECTS YOU, YOU WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SECRET PROGRAMS.
TO A CERTAIN DEGREE YOU HAVE TO TRUST THE PEOPLE YOU ELECTED WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY! IF NOT, WHAT IS IT SAYING ABOUT OUR LEADERS THAT WE CAN'T EVEN TRUST THEM TO WATCH OUR BACKS.
YEAH.
Jon: IT SAYS YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR THEM! SEEMS LIKE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS FOX HAS LOST THE CAPACITY TO TRUST THEIR LEADERS. I THINK I CAN HELP. CLOSE YOUR EYES, GUYS, AND FALL BACKWARDS INTO MY ARMS. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL CATCH YOU. (WHISPERING) NOBODY CATCH THEM. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
