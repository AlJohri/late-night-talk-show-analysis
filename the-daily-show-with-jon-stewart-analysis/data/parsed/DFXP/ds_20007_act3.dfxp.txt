Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA FROM 2009 TO 2011, AND THEN BECAME SECRETARY OF  DEFENSE UNTIL 2013. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WORTHY  FIGHTS." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, SECRETARY LEON  PANETTA. SIR. HELLO! HOW ARE YOU SIR?
THANKS.
Jon: PLEASE HAVE A SEAT. [APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. YOU'VE WRITTEN A BOOK HERE, IT'S CALLED "WORTHY FIGHTS." WE'LL TALK ABOUT YOU. WE'LL TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK. YOU WERE WITH THE CIA, SO  OBVIOUSLY, YOU ALREADY KNOW  EVERYTHING ABOUT ME. WHY? SO, SO, WHEN YOU WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS, AND THEN YOU WANT TO PROMOTE IT, DOES THE PRESIDENT CALL YOU AND SAY, "SHUT UP." OR DOES HE -- WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT IS THE PUSH BACK?
NOT MUCH. NOT MUCH.
Jon: REALLY? THERE HAS NOT BEEN, THEY HAVEN'T CALLED TO  COMPLAIN AND SAY YOU'RE  SPEAKING ILL OF OUR  STRATEGIES AND THAT SORT OF THING?
NO. NO.
Jon: REALLY?
NO.
Jon: IS THAT WHY, SO WERE YOU WORRIED WHEN YOU WROTE --
I MEAN, AFTERALL, I WAS THE CIA DIRECTOR.
Jon: SO THEY'RE AFRAID OF  YOU? LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHAT ARE WE DOING?  [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A RELATIVELY INCOHERENT STRATEGY, AND WE'VE HAD IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. AND TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE  STRATEGIES LIKE THAT YOU  CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT COHERENT. SO WE HAVE THIS IDEA. WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT ISIL. IT'S THIS INCREDIBLY EVIL GROUP. MORE EVIL THAN ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN, AND WE'RE INCREDIBLY SCARED OF THEM. BUT WE'RE ONLY GOING TO FIGHT  THEM FROM THE AIR, AND ONLY IN  CERTAIN PLACES AT CERTAIN  TIMES. DOES THAT SOUND COHERENT?
WELL --
Jon: YES?
I GUESS IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH KOBANI. YOU KNOW, LOOK, WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS...
Jon: YEAH.
AND A TERRORISM THREAT LIKE THIS THAT FRANKLY, YOU KNOW, MOVED AS QUICKLY AS IT DID, I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IN WASHINGTON IS, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE MOVE ON THIS? HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS? HOW DO WE CONFRONT IT? AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT THE PRESIDENT DECIDED IS WE'RE GOING TO CONFRONT ISIS, WE'RE GOING TO PUT TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ TO TRY TO TRAIN THE IRAQI SECURITY FORCE TO DEAL WITH --
Jon: THEY'RE NOT TROOPS ON THE GROUND, THOUGH. HE'S CALLING -- WE'RE CALLING THEM ADVISERS.
YEAH, BUT THEY WEAR BOOTS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: ALRIGHT, SO WE HAVE TROOPS IN IRAQ NOW. CRAZY. SO WE HAVE TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ. BUT APPARENTLY SYRIA WHICH IS  GENERALLY THEIR SAFE HAVEN IS  A TOTALLY SEPARATE ENTITY.
IT IS. SYRIA IS CHAOS RIGHT NOW.
Jon: RIGHT.
NOBODY QUITE KNOWS, YOU KNOW, WHO'S IN THE OPPOSITION, HOW MANY MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION THERE ARE, HOW MANY GROUPS THERE ARE. I MEAN, THAT'S HOW ISIS PRETTY MUCH DEVELOPED. AND SO THAT STRATEGY IS, YOU KNOW,  WE HAVE DECIDED -- THE  PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED THAT  WE'RE GOING TO GO IN AND TRAIN  AND TRY TO ARM THOSE ELEMENTS  THAT HOPEFULLY WILL REPRESENT  A MORE MODERATE OPPOSITION  FORCE THAT CAN THEN HELP US IN  DEFINING THE TARGETS THERE AND  GOING AFTER ISIS IN SYRIA. IT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH  TOUGHER CHALLENGE. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
Jon: SO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  RHETORIC THAT WE HEAR AND THE  REALITY? BECAUSE THE RHETORIC IS, WE'RE  IN THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES. THIS IS AN EXTENTIAL THREAT, THAT WE MUST CONFRONT.
YEAH.
Jon: BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO, YOU KNOW, INVOLVE THE WHOLE COUNTRY. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING  TO GET THE GO AHEAD TO DO WHAT  THEY WANT TO DO WITHOUT MAKING  THE COMMITMENT AND GETTING THE  ENTIRE COUNTRY INVOLVED IN  WHATEVER THIS BATTLE IS.
YEAH, NO. JON, I THINK WHEN WE CONFRONT THIS KIND OF THREAT, AND BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE  LONG AND SUSTAINED, THIS IS  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN THIS OVERNIGHT. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE YEARS TO  BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
Jon: RIGHT.
I THINK WE -- I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS TO  PREPARE THE COUNTRY FOR A LONG  AND SUSTAINED BATTLE AGAINST  ISIS, AND I THINK THE BEST WAY  TO DO IT, FRANKLY, WOULD BE TO  HAVE CONGRESS, REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATS COME TOGETHER TO  GIVE HIM THE AUTHORIZATION.
Jon: WHO DID, NOW WHAT WAS THAT NAME  AGAIN? CONG - GESS? CONG - GESS?
THOSE GUYS THAT ARE UP ON  THE HILL THAT CAN'T DECIDE  WHAT TO DO.
Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THESE GUYS. WE'RE IN THIS EXISTENTIAL FIGHT FOR OUR  LIVES. THEY WON'T COME BACK FROM A  RECESS TO DEBATE THIS ON THE  FLOOR.
YEAH.
Jon: HOW IN GOD'S NAME CAN THAT BE  OKAY?
WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS GOING THROUGH THIS DANCE AS TO  WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD DO  IT. YOU KNOW, WE'D LIKE TO DO IT. WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING  TO DO.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE WOULD WELCOME IT HAPPENING. I THINK FRANKLY, THE PRESIDENT  SHOULD SAY TO THE CONGRESS,  COME BACK, LET'S MAKE A  DECISION HERE WITH REGARDS TO  THE AUTHORIZATION TO TAKE THIS ON. BECAUSE THIS IS WAR. THIS IS WAR.
Jon: BUT WAR POWERS IS CONGRESS' ACT. THEY'RE NOT BABIES. THEY CAN CALL THEMSELVES BACK.
THEY CAN DO THAT TOO.
Jon: THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE INVITED TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING TO DO THIS.
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS  CONGRESS HAS A HARD TIME  TRYING TO FIND THE BATHROOMS IN THE CAPITOL. [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: AND IT BRINGS UP TO THIS OTHER IDEA. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN FLOATED THAT IF ONLY WE HAD KEPT 5,000 TROOPS IN IRAQ AND TRAINED SOME SYRIAN REBELS, NONE OF  THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING? AND TO MY MIND, THAT SEEMS  UNBELIEVABLY UNREALISTIC. WE WERE IN IRAQ FOR 10 YEARS, WE SPENT A TRILLION DOLLARS, WE LOST MANY LIVES, WE TRAINED THIS WHOLE ARMY, THE IDEA THAT THIS ONE SMALL  SOLUTION WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY  AVOIDED THIS CRISIS SEEMS INCREDIBLY REDUCTIVE.
YEAH.
Jon: YET YOU HAVE SENATORS OUT THERE CHAMPIONING IT AS THOUGH IT'S DOGMA.
WELL, YOU KNOW, NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF THAT WOULD BE. I MEAN, I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED A PRESENCE THERE.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE FRANKLY, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THE IRAQIS SECURITY FORCE AND INTELLIGENCE  FORCES WOULD, IN FACT,  CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION TO HELP PROTECT THEIR  COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE BEEN THERE...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON.
Jon: BUT THEY WOULDN'T, APPRENTLY THEY WOULDN'T GIVE OUR TROOPS IMMUNITY, NO?
NO.
Jon: OR THEY, THEY WOULDN'T GIVE THEM PERMISSION.
PRIME MINISTER MALIKI  SAID WE NEED A SOFA AGREEMENT  WHICH IS A STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT.
Jon: RIGHT. SURE.
TO PROTECT THE TROOPS, AND  MALIKI CONTINUED TO RESIST IT,  SAID, YOU KNOW, YEAH, WE SHOULD HAVE YOU DO THIS, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE SOFA AGREEMENT. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEND IT TO THE PARLIAMENT, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE CONTINUEED TO OPPOSE IT. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, I THINK PROBABLY WE COULD HAVE -- WITH THE LEVERAGE WE HAD ON HIM, WITH MILITARY ASSISTANCE, WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE PUSHED HIM A LITTLE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF PROVIDING THAT KIND OF --
Jon: BUT DID HE HAVE THE  LEVERAGE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, IN HIS OWN PARLIAMENT? CLEARLY THE, HIS COALITION WITH THE SADRISTS WAS VERY WEAK TO BEGIN WITH. THE SUNNIS DIDN'T CARE FOR HIM IN ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION.
HE WAS PLAYING THE SHIA GAME WHICH IS BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO CONFRONT THE SUNNIS.
Jon: RIGHT.
I WOULD RATHER DO IT WITHOUT  THE UNITED STATES PRESENT.
Jon: RIGHT, THE SHIITE, SHIA GAME, ONE OF THE WORST CHILDREN GAMES EVER MADE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WILL YOU STICK AROUND? I KNOW YOU HAVE A BOOK PARTY  TO GO TO, BUT WE HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES.
ABSOLUTELY. STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL TALK  ABOUT THIS STUFF. "WORTHY FIGHTS" IT'S ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW. LEON PANETTA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ APPLAUSE ]
