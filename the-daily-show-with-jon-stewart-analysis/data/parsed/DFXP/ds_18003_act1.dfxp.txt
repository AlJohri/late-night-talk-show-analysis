FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."  CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY  COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE'VE GOT KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND  PAUL JOINING US, OBVIOUSLY NAME  FOR HIS FATHER'S FAVORITE  PHILOSOPHER, RAND McNALLLY. A SHORT TIME AGO PRESIDENT OBAMA  AND GOVERNOR ROMNEY WRAPPED UP  THEIR FIRST DEBATE. WHO KNOWS IF THEY EVEN HAD THE  DEBATE WITH YESTERDAY'S  BOMBSHELL. FULL DAY, DRUDGE-CON ONE, BLUE  SIREN ALERT, OBAMA RACE VIDEO. HANNITY HAD THE EXCLUSIVE.
TONIGHT YOU WILL HEAR FROM  BARACK OBAMA LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER  HEARD FROM HIM BEFORE. A VIDEO HAS BEEN UNCOVERED FROM  A CAMPAIGN EVENT IN 2007 OF  THEN-CANDIDATE OBAMA. IT CONTAINS SOME OF THE MOST  DIVISIVE CLASS WARFARE AND  RARLLY CHARGED RHETORIC EVER USE  BY BARACK OBAMA.
Jon: CASUALLY TOSSING OUT  WORDS LIKE HONKY, WHITE TRASH,  O-FAY, SPF-45 WEARING MOTHER... THE VIDEO HAD BEEN WIDELY  COVERED WHEN THE EVENT OCCURRED  IN 2007, BUT THAT DOESN'T  MATTER. I'LL LET HANNITY'S GUEST  EXPLAIN.
PEOPLE SAY, THIS HAS ALREADY  BEEN REPORTED. WELL, IT HASN'T BEEN, AND I KNOW  BECAUSE I REPORTED ON IT THE  FIRST TIME. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: SO LET'S SEE SOME OF  THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS,  EXPLOSIVE VIDEO.
CRACKER ASS, CRACKER ASS  CRACKER. I WISH THAT CRACKER WOULD HAVE  SAID SOME [BLEEPED] TO ME. SALTINE ASS MOTHER [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST  CHRIS ROCK, ONE OF HIS FINE  COMEDY SKITS ON RACE RELATIONS  IN AMERICA. I SHOW THAT IN LOU OF THE OBAMA  TAPES BECAUSE THE OBAMA TAPES  ARE FAR MORE EXPLOSIVE. IN IT, OBAMA EXPLAINS HOW  HURRICANE KATRINA HAS A RARELY  COMPONENT AND SAYS...
WE DON'T NEED TO BUILD MORE  HIGHWAYS OUT IN THE SUBURBS IF  WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE CITIES  RIGHT NOW WHO HAVE TO WORK BUT HAVE NO WAY TO GET TO THE JOBS. WE SHOULD BE INVESTING IN OUR  MINORITY OWNED NEIGHBORHOODS SO  PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL.
Jon: IT'S A BLACK VIEW  FIRST SPOKE IN 2005.
THERE'S DEEP, PERSISTENT  POVERTY IN THIS REGION, AS WELL. THAT POVERTY HAS ROOTS IN THE  HISTORY OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION  WHEN THE STREETS WERE REBUILT. THERE SHOULD BE MANY NEW  BUSINESSES, INCLUDING MINORITY  OWNED BUSINESSES, ALONG THOSE  STREETS.
Jon: [AS GEORGE W. BUSH]:  YOU SEE, WHAT I'M TRYING SAY IS  THIS: WE DIDN'T LAND ON PLYMOUTH ROCK, PLYMOUTH ROCK, YOU SEE,  WON'T GET LANDED ON AGAIN. HE HE HE. SO DESPITE THE FACT WHAT BARACK  OBAMA WAS SAYING ECHOED THE  SENTIMENTSES OF OTHER MAINSTREAM  POLITICIANS AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT ECHOED HIS OWN SPEECH IN  2007 THAT AIRED LIVE ON CNN,  OBAMA'S REAL CRIME WAS NOT THE  CONTENT AND THE MESSAGE, BUT THE RHYTHM, OH, THE RHYTHM. THE RHYTHM IS GOING TO GET YOU.
YOU NOTICE THE WAY IN THE WAY  HE DELIVERS THE SPEECH BEFORE A  PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN?
THE ACCENT, HE'S SPEAKING A  DIFFERENT LANGUAGE, DIFFERENT  CADENCE, DIFFERENT ACCENT,  DIFFERENT GESTURES. THE FALSENESS IS OVERWHELMING.
WE HAVE THE ACCENT. WE HAVE ANGER. THEY DON'T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT  YOU.
Jon: WE HAVE JIVE TALK. WE HAVE NO JUSTICE NO PEACE. WE'VE GOT BY ANY MEANS NESTLE  WE'VE GOT SAY IT LOUD, I'M BLACK  AND PROUD. ALL THIS AND MORE ON K-TEL'S  "NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL  RACE-BAITING."  IF YOU BELIEVE A CANDIDATE  SPEAKING BLACK BEFORE BLACK VOTERS DISQUALIFIES THEM FROM  BEING PRESIDENT, I HAVE  UNEARTHED A VIDEO THAT JUST  MIGHT TURN THIS ENTIRE PRESIDENTIAL RACE UPSIDE DOWN.
WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHO LET THE DOGS OUT, WHO, WHO? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHO LET THE DOGS OUT? DID YOU KNOW MITT ROMNEY WAS ONE  OF THE ORIGINAL BAJA MEN? NOT THE BAND. HE JUST KEEPS HIS MONEY IN BAJA. HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THIS,  IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, SEAN  HANNITY, YOU BELIEVE THE THIS  PRESIDENT TO BE WHAT?
HE'S THE WORST PRESIDENT  WE'VE HAD IN MY LIFETIME. A WORSE PRESIDENT THAN JIMMY  CARTER. THIS IS  THE  WORST PRESIDENT  AMERICA HAS EVER HAD.
Jon: THE WORST EVER IN YOUR  LIFETIME ON RECORD EVER, EVER,  EVER, EVER. AND ON THE EVE OF THE FIRST  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, THE BEST,  MOST EXPLOSIVE CRITIQUE THAT YOU  COULD DELIVER OF THE WORST PRESIDENT WE HAVE EVER HAD IN  THIS COUNTRY IS TREATING US TO  SOME REANIMATED [BLEEPED] VIDEO  ALREADY BEEN SEEN AS THOUGH IT WERE THE RODNEY KING TAPE IN  REVERSE. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY OUR  GREAT BLACK AMERICAN PANEL,  SENIOR BLACK MEN TRAITOR, AND  WYATT CENAK, LARRY WILMORE. WATCHING THAT HANNITY PIECE,  IT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE  SUCH NAKED RACE-BAITING ON  TELEVISION. WHAT IS THAT IN
IT'S SOME BULL BELIEF BELIEF.
YEAH, HANNITY, YOUR OCTOBER  SURPRISE IS THAT THE PRESIDENT  IS BLACK?
THEY ARE SOME DESPERATE  MOTHER [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT ABOUT THIS  ATTEMPT TO PORTRAY A RELATIVELY  MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, LEFT OF  CENTER, TECHNOCRAT AS SOME KIND OF ANGRY BLACK RADICAL?
IT'S SOME BULL BELIEF BELIEF.
YEAH, BLEEP BLEEP HANNITY.
THEY ARE SOME DESPERATE  MOTHER [BLEEPED]. JANUARY JON THAT IS THE SAM  THING YOU JUST SAID. DO YOU NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT  THIS?
NO, JON, WE LOVE BEING PART  OF YOUR GREAT BLACK AMERICAN  BLACK PANEL OF BLACKS. BLACK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WOULD IT BE BETTER TO  HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITHOUT THE  WHITE GUY MODERATING?
NO, JON, THIS IS YOUR SHOW. YOU SHOULD STAY HERE AND  MODERATE THIS BLACK DISCUSSION.
Jon: ALL RIGHT  I'LL BE OVER HERE. FINE. I'LL JUST... I'LL READ. YOU GUYS CAN JUST TALK AMONGST  YOURSELVES. IT'S FINE.
CAN HE HEAR US?
I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SEE. JON, I'VE BEEN SIPHONING GAS  FROM YOUR CAR. ♪♪   ♪♪
Jon: DID YOU CALL ME?
NOPE, NOPE, NOT AT ALL.
Jon: I CAN'T HEAR.
OKAY, SO HOW DO YOU FEEL? DOES IT MAKE YOU ANGRY MANY
IT'S NOT REALLY ANGRY AS MUCH  AS IT'S DEPRESSING. I MEAN, THIS IS THE SAME  DOG-WHISTLE STUFF THEY'VE BEEN  PULLING ALL THE TIME, LICE IT'S  ACORN AND SHIRLEY SHERROD AND COMMON AT THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S THE SAME STUFF.
WAS HE LISTENING TO "FIDDLER  ON THE ROOF"? [LAUGHTER]
SERIOUSLY, I CANNOT BELIEVE  THEY SAY [BLEEPED] OUT LOUD  SOMETIMES. IT'S JUST DESPERATE.
I CAN BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE  NO RATIONAL ARGUMENT, YOU HAVE  TO BYPASS THAT PART OF THE BRAIN THAT PROCESSES RATIONAL  ARGUMENTS, RIGHT? YOU JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE  REPTILE BRAIN, THE AMYGDALA, AND  YOU JUST DOPE IT WITH ENOUGH  COATED LANGUAGE AND RACIAL IMAGERY TO TRIGGER THE FEAR  RESPONSE.
BY THE WAY, IS THERE A REASON  JON CAN'T HEAR THIS CONVERSATION  IN
NO, PLEASE.
WE JUST WANT MORE AIR TIME. SPEAKING OF, SHOULD WE  PROBABLY...
YEAH, WAKE HIM UP.
ALREADY.
HEY, HEY, WHAT'S UP? ♪ NET   ♪♪
Jon: THANKS. YOU GUYS DONE RAPPING AND  JAMMING?
YES, JON. WE'RE DONE RAPPING AND JAMMING.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. HEY, I THINK IT'S INFORMATIVE  WHEN WE CAN DISCUSS THESE THINGS  WITH PANEL OF PEOPLE DIRECTLY  AFFECTED BY THEM. HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL BE  SEEN BY PEOPLE WHO READ THE  DRUDGE REPORT?
I DON'T KNOW, RUN IT THROUGH  THE OLD DRUDGEY CAM.
Jon: RIGHT, THE LENS WE  FILTER ALL THEIR INFORMATION  THROUGH. CAN YOU CUE THAT UP.
WE'RE IN YOUR FRONT YARD AND  WE'RE STILL MAD ABOUT SLAVERY.
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO BUY  CRACK WITH THE FOOD STAMPS  YOU'RE PAYING FOR.
AND THEN WE'RE GOING THE RAPE  YOUR WHITE BABIES.
HEY, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, THAT'S TOO MUCH.
SETTLE DOWN.
SORRY. THIS IS MY FIRST BLACK PANEL,  GUYS. I'M REALLY EXIED. REALLY NICE TO BE HERE.
Jon: THANK YOU, GUYS. LARRY, JESSICA AND
