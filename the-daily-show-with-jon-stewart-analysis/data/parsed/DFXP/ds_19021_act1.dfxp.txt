FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. AUTHOR, HONORARY RED SOX, DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN WILL BE JOINING US. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT-- ( LAUGHTER ) I AM THE WORST SEGUE PERSON IN THE WORLD. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT! ( LAUGHTER ) I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH AN EYE ON THE MEDIA IN OUR NEW SEGMENT MEH CULPA. ONE OF THE MOST HALLOWED NAMES IN ALL OF JOURNALISM IS "60 MINUTES," A SHOW THAT HAS FOR WEEK AFTER WEEK FOR OVER 45 MINUTES BROUGHT US 58 MINUTES OF HARD-HITTING GROUNDBREAKING INVESTIGATIONS INTO EVERYTHING FROM CORPORATE GREED AND CORRUPT GOVERNANCE, AND TWO MINUTES OF MUSINGS.
BOUGHT 1,000 HONEY DUE MELONS AND ONLY THREE OF THEM WERE RIPE OVER THE YEARS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I THINK HE'D WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS-- A GREAT WRITER-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE AUDIENCE WAS TRAINED BEHAVIORABLY TO REACT TO SOMETHING THAT WE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ANYWAY THE MAN CLEARLY COULD NOT PICK OUT GOOD PRODUCE. MY POINT IS THIS-- LAST MONTH, IT LOOKED LIKE "60 MINUTES" HAD DONE IT AGAIN, SCORING AN EXPLOSIVE INTERVIEW WITH AN EYEWITNESS TO THE TERRIBLE EVENTS IN BENGHAZI.
ONE GUY SAW ME. HE JUST SHOUTED. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE'D SEEN ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK. HE STARTED WALKING TOWARDS ME, JUST HIT WITH THE BUTT OF THE RIFLE IN THE FACE. I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GLASS, I KNEW WHO IT WAS IMMEDIATELY
WHO WAS IT?
IT WAS THE AMBASSADOR, DEAD.
Jon:  IT WAS A CHILLING DESCRIPTION OF LACK OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST VULNERABLE DIPLOMATIC OUTPOSTS. THERE'S ONE SMALL PROBLEM. IT'S TOTAL ( BLEEP ). HE MADE THE WHOLE THING UP! HAH! BURN! WHICH "60 MINUTES" SORT OF ACKNOWLEDGED SUNDAY NIGHT.
DYLAN DAVIES TOLD US HE WENT TO THE COMPOUND DURING THE ATTACK AND DETAILED HIS ROLE THAT NIGHT. AFTER OUR REPORT AIRED, QUESTIONS AROSE ABOUT WHETHER HIS ACCOUNT WAS TRUE.
Jon:  WE THOUGHT OF RAISING THE "IS THIS TRUE" QUESTION BEFORE AIRING. THESE EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS -- BUT IT'S SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS! ( LAUGHTER ) TO CHECK AND WHAT IF IT WAS ( BLEEP )? AND THEN WE'VE GOT THESE 10 MINUTES TO KILL. AH, I DON'T KNOW! THE BEST PART IS HOW "60 MINUTES" FOUND OUT THE GUY WAS LYING.
WE DISCOVERED THE ACCOUNT HE GAVE THE F.B.I. WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HE TOLD US.
Jon:  WHAT! ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU CANNOT TRUST AN INTERNATIONAL MERCENARY EXISTING IN THE NETHERWORLD TWIXT ASSASSIN AND BOUNTY HUNTER, WHOSE VERY LIVELIHOOD IS PREDICATED ON THE FLEXIBLE MORALITY NEEDED TO SURVIVE IN THE CHAOS AND LAWLESSNESS OF FAILED NATIONS-- WHO CAN YOU TRUST? ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT SANTA ISN'T REAL. ( LAUGHTER ) SPOILER ALERT! BUT YOU KNOW, "60 MINUTES" IS NOT THE ONLY VICTIM HERE. A CERTAIN LINFORTH BOREGARD GRAHAM WILL ALSO PAY A PRICE FOR THIS MAN'S INSOLENCE. YOU SEE, BLANCHE DE GRAHAM, HAS BEEN HOLDING UP PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENTS BASED ON THIS "60 MINUTES" REPORT EXPLAINING THAT THE F.B.I. REPORTS WILL VINDICATE HIM.
WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT DID NOT RELEASE IS THAT HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE F.B.I. ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS WHERE HE CLAIMS TO HAVE TOLD THE F.B.I. THAT HE WENT TO THE COMPOUND AND HE FOUND CHRIS STEVENS' BODY AT THE HOSPITAL. THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS A BAD HABIT OF TELLING STORIES THAT ARE NOT TRUE, THAT ARE POLITICALLY BENEFICIAL.
Jon:  AND I HAVE ALWAYS DEPENDED UPON THE TESTIMONY OF STRANGERS! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )   ( CHEERS ) I DON'T KNOW HOW HE-- I DON'T WHAT'S GOING ON ANYMORE. HE'S GONE FROM BEING BLANCH DUBOIS TO FOGHORN LEGHORN. HE SAYS THE F.B.I. TESTIMONY WAS GOING TO VINDICATE HIM. IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE OPPOSITE. I IMAGINE HE'LL BE WHISTLING A DIFFERENT DIXIE POST-"60 MINUTES" APOLOGY.
BUT WHAT SPURRED YOUR ACTION TO BLOCK THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES WAS THE "60 MINUTES" REPORT.
I RELEASED TWO AMBASSADORS THAT I HAD A HOLD ON BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT A BIPARTISAN WAY TO INTERVIEW THESE WITNESSES.
RIGHT NOW, YOUR THREAT TO HOLD UP NOMINEES STANDS?
I'VE RELEASED TWO. I'VE RELEASED TWO. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  AND YOU'RE ALL JUST GOING TO HAVE TO FIND THE REST.   ( APPLAUSE ) IF I-- IF I-- IF I BELIEVE YOU'RE UP TO THE CHALLENGE, DETECTIVE. ( LAUGHTER ) I'D HURRY UP IF I WAS YOU BECAUSE THE BASEMENT IS SLOWLY FILLING WITH PUDDING! ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) WHY PUT PUDDING IN THERE? LISTEN! I'LL SAY THIS FOR "60 MINUTES--" AS HALF-ASSED AS IT WAS, AT LEAST THEY ADMITTED THEY WERE WRONG AND APOLOGIZED. IT'S MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR ANOTHER JOURNALISTIC ICON.
"TIME" MAGAZINE RELEASES ITS LATEST ISSUE THAT HAS CHRIS CHRISTIE ON THE COVER. THE HEADLINE IS "THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM."
Jon:  OH, I GET IT! BECAUSE HE'S LARGE! HE'S A LARGE MAN! HA-HA! THAT MUST HAVE GIVEN YOUR READERS A GOOD LAUGH, WHETHER THEY ENCOUNTERED YOUR MAGAZINE WHILE WAITING TO SEE A GASTROENTEROLOGIST OR USING THEIR GRANDPARENTS' BATHROOM. I GUESS WE SHOULD GIVE "TIME" MAGAZINE CREDIT FOR TONING DOWN THE ORIGINAL COVER VERSION. THAT'S NOT EVEN A PLAY ON WORDS, NOTHING EVEN CLEVER ABOUT IT. WHY THE FAT JOKE TIME?
"THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM." DOES THIS MAKE FUN OF A SERIOUS ISSUE?
NOT IN OUR MINDS AT ALL. WE REALLY-- IT'S A-- IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH, AND THAT'S REALLY HOW WE MEAN IT TO BE INTERPRETED.
Jon:  I MEAN, IT'S JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH. ALL WE DID WAS BLOW UP A GIANT PICTURE OF CHRIS CHRISTIE'S HEAD IN PROFILE, LIPS AGAPE AS IF BEGGING TO BE HOT DOGGED... ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND WE JUXTAPOSED THAT WITH THE IDEA OF THE LARGEST LAND MAMMAL IN EXISTENCE. IF YOU INTERPRET THAT AS A FAT IF YOU INTERPRETED THAT AS A FAT JOKE, WELL THAT IS ON YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) SO THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CHRISTIE'S SIZE?
HE'S A BIG GUY, AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HIS PHYSICAL SIZE. IT'S ABOUT HIS WHOLE POLITICAL ACT.
HE'S, OBVIOUSLY, A BIG GUY. HE'S, OBVIOUSLY, A BIG REPUBLICAN, BUT HE'S ALSO DONE A REALLY HUGE THING HERE THIS WEEK. >>YOU'RE STILL ZINGING THE GUY! THAT'S NOT AN APOLOGY. YOU'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON HIM. HE'S A GIGANTIC FIGURE-- HIS INFLUENCE IS COMICALLY OVER-- HE IS-- HE IS MORBIDLY IMPORTANT. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING.
TWO CAN PLAY THAT GAME, "TIME" MAGAZINE. THE COVER OF "DAILY SHOW" MAGAZINE THIS WEEK IS A FIGURE OF SPEECH ABOUT HOW "TIME" PROCESSES INFORMATION, DIGESTS IT, AND THEN LEAVES ITS INSIGHTS TO ITS READERS TO PICK THROUGH. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
