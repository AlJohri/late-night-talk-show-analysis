Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS IS THE SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF ILLINOIS. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW SENATOR DICK DURBIN. SIR, NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU DOING? THAT WAS NICE. YOU SAW THE SHOW BACK IN THE GREEN ROOM.
YEAH, I DID.
Jon: I APOLOGIZE. NORMALLY THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF WE WOULD SHOW SOMEONE FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. YOU ARE MORE OBVIOUSLY ESTEEMINGED. HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP? YOU'VE BEEN AT THE SENATE HOW LONG?
15 YEARS.
Jon: 15 YEARS. IS THIS THE WORST IT'S BEEN? DO YOU SENSE PEOPLE'S UPSET WITH CONGRESS?
JON, THEY SAY THE APPROVAL RATING OF CONGRESS IS BETWEEN 6 AND 19. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT MANY RELATIVES, SO I GET...
Jon: IT'S UGLY OUT THERE.
THE NUMBERS ARE INFLATED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IS IT... DO YOU... DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE  THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE FRUSTRATED WITH, FOR INSTANCE, THIS DEBT CEILING ISSUE AND THE DEFICIT  REDUCTION PLANS AND THOSE THINGS? ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEING INCREDIBLY UNFAIR, OR CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR UPSET?
OH, I DO. I UNDERSTAND IT. HERE WE HAVE AN ECONOMY WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. WE'RE NOT GETTING WELL FAST ENOUGH. AND UP COMES THE IDEA OF DEFAULTING ON AMERICA'S DEBT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. LET'S SEE HOW THAT WORKS. AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY, WELL, THAT'S SELF-INFLICTED WOUND. IT IS A POLITICALLY MANUFACTURED CRISIS. IT'S JUST GOING THE MAKE THINGS WORSE.
Jon: YOU IN ESSENCE DON'T CARE FOR CONGRESS EITHER?
TRUST ME, THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I DON'T, AND I'M PRETTY  CLOSE TO IT, SO I SEE IT BEHIND THE SCENES.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT'S SO INTERESTING. THE DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN THAT WE GOT SEEMS VERY SIMILAR. YOU WERE ON THIS SIMPSON-BOWL COMMITTEE. NOW THAT WAS CREATED TO COME UP WITH A THOUGHTFUL, BIPARTISAN SOLUTION LONG TERM TO OUR CRISIS. HOW LONG DID YOU WORK ON THAT?
TEN MONTHS.
Jon: AND IT WAS... WHAT WAS IT INVOLVED IN?
WELL, THERE WERE 18 OF US APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT AND THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS, PRETTY  WELL EVENLY DIVIDED IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, BUSINESS SECTOR AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO WORK IN GOVERNMENT. AND WE SAT AND CONSIDERED ALL THE OPTIONS. AT THE END OF IT, AND I THAWING ERSKINE BOWLES DID A MASTERFUL JOB, THEY SAID, HERE IT IS. WHEN I LOOKED AT IT, I THOUGHT, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE AREIN' MANY OPTIONS. YOU HAVE BASICALLY THREE THINGS -- SPENDING, GENERAL SPENDING, THE ENTITLEMENT  PROGRAMS AND REVENUE OR TAXES. AND IF YOU DON'T PUT THEM ALL ON THE TABLE, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE  TOO MUCH OUT OF ONE OR THE OTHER. I VOTED FOR IT. 11 OUT OF 18 VOTED FOR IT.
Jon: THIS DID NOT MAKE IT TO CONGRESS.
NO.
Jon: THEY NEVER GOT CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING WITH IT BECAUSE THE GROUP THAT WAS FORMED TO  MAKE IT REJECTED IT.
11 OUT OF 18 DID. AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET 14, BUT THE CLOCK HAD RUN OUT ON US TO BE HONEST. THAT'S WHY THE GANG OF SIX CAME ABOUT.
Jon: THAT'S NEXT STEP.
SACKSBY CHAMBLISS OF GEORGIA, MARK WARNER OF VIRGINIA SAID, CAN WE TAKE THIS BOLD IDEA AND ACTUALLY TURN IT INTO LEGISLATION.
Jon: YOU WERE ON THE GANG OF SIX, AS WELL.
I WAS.
Jon: THE GANG OF SIX, SIMPSON BOWLES SOUNDS LIKE A BRITISH WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE. BUT GANG OF SIX, THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS. NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HURT. [LAUGHTER] WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
FIRST THE TATTOOS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: TERRIBLE. A FEW SECRET HANDSHAKES. THEN WE SAT DOWN FOR ABOUT FIVE, SIX MONTHS AND WORKED IT THROUGH. HOW DO WE TURN THIS IDEA INTO A LAW? IT WASN'T EASY. BUT WE DID IT. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DID IT TOO LATE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING, ANY FAULT THAT WE'D HAVE WITH OUR EFFORT, WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS WEEKS BEFORE SO WE WERE PLAYERS IN THIS LAST CONVERSATION. BUT HERE'S WHAT WAS INTERESTING. WE HELD A MEETING ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, INVITED 70 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO HAD EXPRESSED AN  INTEREST IN THIS TO COME AROUND AND LET US TELL YOU WHAT WE'VE DECIDED. 49 SHOWED UP. EQUALLY INVITED. THEN WE SAID, ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE THE NEXT STEP. ARE YOU READY TO SIGN ON THE LINE HERE, PUT YOUR NAME NEXT TO THIS THING. 36 SENATORS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, SAID, WE'LL SIGN IT. AND IT'S THE REAL THING. IT ISN'T A JOKE. I MEAN, IT REALLY DOES GET TO THE BOTTOM. THAT'S WHAT, DESPITE ALL THE NEGATIVE FEELINGS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT CONGRESS, THERE IS A FORCE  AT WORK HERE AMONG AT LEAST THE SENATORS THAT I SERVE WITH, A BIPARTISAN FORCE, THAT GETS IT RIGHT. AND I THINK IT, WITH THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY, CAN DEAL WITH THIS IN A GROWN-UP WAY. SO WHAT WE'VE JUST SEEN WAS EMBARRASSING.
Jon: SO 16 MONTHS YOU PUT IN ON THIS.
MAKE IT 16 TO 18 MONTHS.
Jon: SO YOU COULD HAVE HAD TWO KIDS IN THAT TIME.
THAT'S A RECURRING THEME ON THIS SHOW.
Jon: IT REALLY IS. BUT IN THAT TIME, YOU HONED THIS DOWN, AND YET ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT EVEN CONSIDERED. ALL THAT WORK. IS THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT WILL BE USED IN THE NEXT FIGHT? OR AT WHAT POINT ARE YOU JUST ON A STATIONARY BICYCLE AND WHAT... BECAUSE NOW THERE IS AN IDEA OF A SUPER COMMITTEE.
RIGHT.
Jon: THAT WILL BE THE GANG OF SIX BUT WITH FIVES OR WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO DO. AND WHAT WILL THAT ACCOMPLISH?
WELL, IN FAIRNESS, WE WEREN'T READY FOR PRIME TIME. WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS THING IN WRITING. WE WEREN'T THERE. BUT WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GET THERE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SO ALONG COMES THE IDEA OF A JOINT COMMITTEE. NOW, I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE. I SAW IT IN THE ORIGINAL ENGLISH WITH BOWLES-SIMPSON. AND THEN I SAW IT IN SUBTITLES IN GANG OF SIX. AND NOW THEY'RE GOING... WHATEVER IT IS. IT ALWAYS ENDS THE SAME WAY. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME THINGS ON THE TABLE. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO EACH OF THESE THAT'S GOOD TO THE ECONOMY AND FAIR TO EVERYBODY. SO I HOPE THAT AT SOME POINT THIS JOINT COMMITTEE TAKES WHAT WE'VE DONE AND PUTS IT ON THE  TABLE AND SAYS, LET'S SAVE SOME TIME. THIS JOINT COMMITTEE HAS TEN WEEKS, LITERALLY TEN WEEKS START TO FINISH TO COME UP WITH THE PRODUCT. THAT'S NOT A LOT OF TIME.
NOW IS THAT A PRODUCT THAT THEN NEEDS TO BE VOTED ON BY THE  FULL HOUSE AND THE FULL SENATE.
AND IF IT FAILS, IN COMES THE SO-CALLED TRIGGERS. THAT MEANS DEEP SPENDING CUTS ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE WHERE WE'VE ALREADYIEN A -- ALREADY TAKE AN  BIG CUT.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL ANY REGRETS THAT THE DEMOCRATS, WHEN THEY HAD CONTROL OF THE HOUSE  AND SENATE, DIDN'T JUST PASS A BUG WHEN THEY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO, DIDN'T PUNCH IT  OUT OF FEAR OF LOSING SEATS IN THE HOUSE, SO THAT THE REPUBLICANS COULD COME IN, CHANGE THAT SO-CALLED GEPHARDT RULE AND MAKE IT SO THAT THE DEBT CEILING DOESN'T  AUTOMATICALLY GET RAISED IN A BUDGET? IF THEY HAD DONE THAT, WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BASICALLY AVOIDED THIS ENTIRE DEBACLE?
WE COULD HAVE SPARED OURSELVES OF THIS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR, AND I'LL POINT THE FINGER ON MY  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES.
Jon: NOW THAT SEEMS SURPRISING.
IS THAT OKAY?
Jon: YEAH.
MANY OF THEM HAVE SAID THEY LIKE WAR, THEY LIKE WAGING WAR, THEY LIKE THE NOTION OF STAYING IN WAR. THEY THINK WE SHOULD SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN WAR, AND WHEN THE  PRESIDENT SAYS, UH, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BORROW A LITTLE MONEY TO DO THIS, NO WAY. I'M JUST FOR WAR WHEN I DON'T HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE DEBT CEILING.
Jon: TO BE FAIR, I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD SAY, I LIKE WAR. YOU MEAN THAT METAPHORICALLY.
METAPHORICALLY.
Jon: YOU MEAN THEY LIKE TO FIGHT?
THEY LIKE THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD ENGAGE OUR TROOPS IN  COMBAT TO ASSERT PERK'S POSITION IN THE WORLD. SOME OF US FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WERE 23 OF US WHO VOTED AGAINST THE WAR IN IRAQ.
Jon: THAT'S... THAT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH THAT COMPLETELY, BUT THAT'S LIKE... CAN YOU STICK AROUND FAR LITTLE BIT? I DO WANT TO EXPLORE THAT. WE'LL THROW THAT UP ON THE WEB. OKAY. DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] SENATOR DICK DURBIN. THE SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS. [APPLAUSE]
