John: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT REPRESENTING THE GREAT  STATE OF KENTUCKY, HIS LATEST BOOK OUT IN PAPER BACK IS CALLED  "GOVERNMENT BULLIES, HOW  EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE BEING HARASSED, ABUSED AND IMPRISONED  BY THE FEDS."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  SENATOR RAND PAUL! (APPLAUSE)  SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING  WITH US THIS EVENING. I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU IF YOU  ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT  BECAUSE IT'S THE YEAR 2013 SO I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE.
AND THE ALARM CLOCK HAS NOT  GONE OFF.
John: THAT'S RIGHT, EXACTLY.
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY EXCITED  TO BE ON THE JOHN OLIVER SHOW. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOUR OWN  SHOW.
John: YOU DON'T WANT TO BE  EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THAT'S YOUR FIRST LIE. SO INSTEAD --  (LAUGHTER)  -- INSTEAD, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. YOU ARE FOR IT OR AGAINST IT, I  FORGET? (LAUGHTER)
I'M AFRAID IT'S GOING TO BE  UNAFFORDABLE AND THIS'S THE REAL  PROBLEM. I'M AFRAID EVERYONE WILL PAY A  LOT MORE FOR INSURANCE AND I  THINK PRECISELY THE PEOPLE IT WAS INTENDED TO HELP IT MAY WELL  HURT BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE  ABLE TO AFFORD IT BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS MANDATED THAT THE  INSURANCE COVER SO MANY THINGS  THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY  EXPENSIVE.
John: THAT'S WHAT'S  INTERESTING TO ME. BECAUSE NO ONE -- 40 VOTES  AGAINST OBAMACARE NO ONE COULD  ACCUSE REPUBLICANS OF BEING IN FAVOR OF THIS. YOU'VE LEFT ALL YOUR CONTEMPT  OUT ON THE FIELD WITH THIS ONE. YET WHY DOES IT MATTER SO MUCH? IS IT THE MAN SKATE IN IS THAT  WHAT YOU HAVE THIS KIND OF  RELIGIOUS OBJECTION TO?
WELL, THE THING IS, I THINK  WE ALL WANT MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE  HEALTH CARE. WE ALL WANT MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE  INSURANCE. BUT WE THINK THE OPPOSITE WILL  HAPPEN. I TELL PEOPLE THAT THERE'S  ALWAYS THE -- IN WASHINGTON  PEOPLE HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS AND I DON'T REALLY BEGRUDGE THE  DEMOCRATS AND I DON'T SAY THEIR  MOTIVES ARE BAD, I JUST SAY THAT WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THE  OPPOSITE WILL HAPPEN. AND IT'S KIND OF BECAUSE WE HAVE  THIS -- IT'S -- I CALL IT THE  DINOSAUR SYNDROME. WE HAVE A LOT OF POLITICIANS  THAT HAVE REALLY SMALL BRAINS  AND REALLY BIG HEARTS AND THEY WANT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT BUT I  DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK.
John: RIGHT. AND I'M NOT SITTING ACROSS FROM  A DIPLODONKUS?
EXACTLY RIGHT. THERE'S ONLY CERTAIN  POLITICIANS.
John: BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS  INTELLECTUALLY CONSISTENTS WHEN  IT COMES TO THE BANKS. LET THE BANKS FAIL, LET THE  MARKET CORRECT ITSELF. WHAT IS TENS OF MILLIONS OF  AMERICANS BEING UNINSURED IF  IT'S NOT MARKET FAILURE?
WELL, THE MARKET HAS FAILED  IN HEALTH CARE BUT BECAUSE OF  TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT NOT TOO LITTLE GOVERNMENT. I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES. I'M AN EYE SURGEON. IN MY PRACTICE THERE WERE TWO  THINGS THAT INSURANCE DIDN'T  COVER THAT THE PRICE WENT DOWN EVERY YEAR: LASIK SURGERY TO GET  RID OF GLASSES WENT FROM  $2,000 AN EYE TO LESS THAN $500 AN EYE BECAUSE OF COMPETITION. COMPETITION BRINGS DOWN PRICES. CONTACT LENSES. I SOLD CONTACT LENSES AT PRICES  THAT WAL-MART DID NOT BECAUSE I  WANTED TO BUT BECAUSE I HAD TO  COMPETE. MY PATIENTS WENT TO WAL-MART. SO COMPETITION BRINGS DOWN  PRICES. WHAT HAPPENED IN HEALTH CARE IS  WE CONNECTED IT TO EMPLOYMENT  AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER TIME, DEDUCTIBLES GOT LOWER AND LOW  SORE GOULD TO THE HOSPITAL AND  HAVE HEART SURGERY, YOUR BILL WOULD BE  $100,000 AND YOUR MOUTHWASH  WOULD COST $55 AND YOU'D GO  "THAT'S RIDICULOUS." BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY IT SO  YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE PRICE  AND YOU DIDN'T BRING PRICES DOWN BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT  WHAT THE COST OF THINGS WERE.
John: AS YOU SAY IN YOUR BOOK  YOU'RE A DISSIGNABLE FOR SMALLER  GOVERNMENT BUT IS THERE A PART OF HEALTH CARE WHERE GOVERNMENT  SHOULD STEP IN WHERE BUSINESS IS  NOT DOING IT? THE BUSINESSES HAD DECADES OF  OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE PEOPLE AND  IT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO.
WELL,, NO 85% OF PEOPLE HAVE  INSURANCE. SO 15% DIDN'T. SO WHAT YOU NEED DO IS LOOK AT  WHO ARE THE 15% AND WHY DON'T  THEY HAVE INSURANCE? OF THE 15% WHO DIDN'T HAVE  INSURANCE, HALF OF THEM MADE  MORE THAN  $50,000. WHY DIDN'T THEY BUY INSURANCE? BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE. THEY WERE YOUNG, HEALTHY PEOPLE. SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM. YOU HAVE A YOUNG AUDIENCE AND  YOU TELL THEM "OH, YOU MUST BUY  INSURANCE" BUT THEY SAY "WELL, I MAKE $30,000 A YEAR BUT YOUR  INSURANCE COSTS  $15,000, HOW'S THE MANDATE GOING  TO WORK?" LET'S SAY THEY'RE ONE OF FIVE  EMPLOYEES FOR A SMALL BUSINESS,  THERE'S NO INSURANCE, HOW DO THEY BUY INSURANCE IF THEY MAKE  $30,000 AND THE INSURANCE COSTS  $15,000? THEY NEED THE OPPOSITE. THEY DON'T NEED LOW DEDUCTIBLES,  THEY NEED HIGH DEDUCTIBLES, THEY  NEED INSURANCE FOR CATASTROPHES BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE UNLIKELY TO  GET ILL, THEY NEED IT FOR THE  RARE OCCASION, NOT THE EVERYDAY  OCCASION.
John: HOW DO YOU BALANCE OUT  THE FREE MARKET'S GOAL-- TO MAKE  MONEY-- WITH THE SOCIETY GOAL TO STOP PEOPLE FROM DYING? BECAUSE THOSE TWO THINGS ARE  OFTEN AT ODDS.
WELL, THE THING IS, YOU HAVE  TO ASK YOURSELF WHAT DISTRIBUTES  THE MOST AMOUNT OF GOODS AT THE CHEAPEST PRICE? AND THAT'S VOLUNTARY EXCHANGE. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, EVERYBODY NEEDS  BREAD. YOU NEED BREAD AND WATER JUST AS  MUCH AS YOU NEED HEALTH CARE, IF  NOT MORE. SO IN THE SOVIET UNION THEY SAID  -- THEY'D GIVE BREAD TO EVERYONE  AND THEY WOULD SET THE PRICE OF  BREAD. BUT THEY WOULD SET IT AT 80  CENTS A LOAF AND THE MARKET  WOULD SAY IT'S A DOLLAR AND THERE'D BE NO BREAD. THE STORE SHELVES WOULD BE EMPTY  SO REALLY THE ALLOCATION, THE  CENTRAL ALLOCATION BY CENTRAL AUTHORITIES DECIDING HOW TO  DISTRIBUTE HEALTH CARE IS AN  INEFFICIENT WAY. GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE: YOU'VE BEEN  TO BRITAIN? (LAUGHTER)  YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
John: I'M NEVER GOING BACK,  I'LL TELL YOU THAT! I LIKE IT HERE!
YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU'LL WAIT IN LINE.
NO, THAT'S NOT WHY. (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS GENUINELY NOT WHY. IF I GET SICK, I'LL GET ON A  PLANE AND GO BACK BECAUSE  THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF ME.
THEY PROBABLY WILL AND I  THINK'S SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR  MENTAL ILLNESS AS WELL OVER  THERE. (LAUGHTER)
John: WELL PLAYED. WELL PLAYED. SO THAT SESSION WENT A LITTLE  BIT LONG. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE REST OF  IT
