MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE FOUNDER OF WIKIPEDIA, WHICH IS CELEBRATING ITS TENTH ANNIVERSARY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JIMMY WALES. HOW ARE YOU?
VERY GOOD. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU.
Jon: HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO WIKIPEDIA.
I KNOW. IT'S AMAZING.
Jon: DID YOU HAVE A SENSE WHEN YOU THOUGHT THIS UP THAT IT WOULD BE... THAT IT WOULD BE  SOMETHING WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE IDEAS THAT COMES TO YOU IN A DREAM AND YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY  THIS IS SOMETHING?
WELL, I WAS ALWAYS VERY OPTIMISTICMENT. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE LIST OF THE TOP 50 WEB SITES AND SAW A REFERENCE SITE IN THE TOP 50. WE'RE NOW THE FIFTH MOST POPULAR WEB SITE IN THE WORLD.
Jon: HOW DID YOU FIND THAT INFORMATION OUT?
I LOOKED IT UP ON WIKIPEDIA.
Jon: INTERESTING. AND YOU BELIEVE IT.
I WROTE IT, JON, SO...
Jon: YOU WROTE IT. IT IS STRANGE TO LOOK UP WIKIPEDIA ON WIKIPEDIA BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT IS NICE ABOUT  WIKIPEDIA, IT IS A STORY OF HISTORIES THAT INCLUDES THE GOOD AND THE BAD ALL IN THE SAME... EVERYBODY GETS TO TAKE THEIR SHOT.
ABSOLUTELY.  IF YOU REALLY WANT THE SEE THE WORST CRITICISM OF WIKIPEDIA, GO TO WIKIPEDIA AND LOOK UP THE  ARTICLE, CRITICISM OF WIKIPEDIA. WE DOCUMENT EVERYTHING BAD EVERYONE HAS EVER SAID ABOUT US IN EXCRUCIATING DETAIL.
Jon: IT'S KIND OF COOL. ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA, YOU HAD TO SCRIBBLE YOUR NOTES IN THE MARGINS AND DRAW LOTS OF PENISES.
AS ONE DOES.
Jon: HASN'T BEEN AROUND IN A WHILE. THE PROBLEM PEOPLE HAVE IS ACCURACY OR BIAS. PEOPLE CAN GAME IT OR GOOF IT. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT?
THE MAIN THING IS THERE IS A CORE COMMUNITY THAT ARE REALLY PARK MATT PEOPLE ABOUT GETTING  IT RIGHT. THEY'RE REALLY THE FIRST DEFENSE AGAINST ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WHEN WE SEE ACADEMIC STUDIES OF THE QUALITY OF WIKIPEDIA, WHICH  THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENOUGH OF, WE DO QUITE WELL. IT'S NOT PERFECT, BUT WE'RE ALL LOOKING TO IMPROVE IT.
FOR INSTANCE, ON WIKIPEDIA YOU ARED AS THE CO-FOUNDER, BUT ARE YOU THE FOUNDER OR THE CO-FOUNDER.
WELL, SOURCES MAY VARY.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WELL, I SAY I'M THE FOUNDER, BUT I THINK IT'S A SILLY DEBATE. I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL THAT INTERESTING OR IMPORTANT. I'M A CENTRAL TIER, LIKE THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS WHO WRITE WIKIPEDIA. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.
Jon: SO YOU'RE OKAY IF THEY CHANGE YOUR TIGHT FEDERAL FOUNDER TO VOLUNTEER.
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT. LET'S DO THAT.
Jon: HAVE AT IT.
THERE WE GO.
Jon: IS IMPRESSIVE THING IS TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S FIFTH  MOST VISITED WEB SITE AND NOT FEEL THE URGE TO COMPLETELY MONETIZE IT. HAS THAT... HAVE YOU FELT THAT URGE? DO YOU LOOK AT FACEBOOK? DO YOU SIT IN THE FACEBOOK MOVIE IN THE BACK WITH A BATTLE OF JACK GOING, I COULD BE THOSE PRICKS? HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
NO, I MEAN, FOR US, FOR ME WIKIPEDIA IS SOMETHING THAT I HOPE IS REALLY IMPORTANT CULTURALLY. WE'RE A SPACE THAT'S NOT COMMERCIAL. WE'RE SPACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN LEARN, REFLECT, SHARE KNOWLEDGE. WE'RE GLOBAL IN SCOPE, TRYING THE SHARE FREE INFORMATION WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE  PLANET IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE. I THINK IN 500 YEARS PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY, FACEBOOK? WHAT WAS THAT. BUT THEN THEY'LL SAY, OH, WIKIPEDIA.
Jon: REALLY, BECAUSE I THINK IN 500 YEARS THEY'LL SEE BEEP, BLARP, BLOP. HUMANS CATCH ME. IT'S INTERESTING YOU BROUGHT UP THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING  THINGS ABOUT WIKIPEDIA IS THAT IT ABIDES BY THE LAWS OF FLORIDA. I JUSTIFIED THAT TO BE SO INTERESTING THAT IT IS THIS OPEN SOURCE, NON-COMMERCIAL  INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON THAT ABIDES THE RULES OF FLORIDA. MAYBE OUR NATION'S SILLIEST STATE.
YEAH, YEAH. I REMEMBER VERY EARLY ON SOME VOLUNTEERS FROM EUROPE SAID, WELL, WHAT ARE THE LAWS IN FLORIDA RELATING TO NUDITY. AND I SAID, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT'S MANDATORY.
Jon: HOW IS IT THAT THEY HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THIS INTERNATIONAL PHENOMENON?
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
Jon: I ASSUME MOST THINGS ARE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THATMENT
OUR SERVES, THE PRIMARY SERVER FARM IS IN FLORIDA FOR HISTORICAL REASONS. WHEN WIKIPEDIA STARTED GETTING REALLY BIG, I WAS IN FLORIDA. I WENT AND PHYSICALLY INSTALLED SERVERS OVER RACKS AT THE DATA CENTER. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF SERVERS THERE IN FLORIDA.
Jon: THE MAJORITY OF THE PAID WIKIPEDIA EMPLOYEES, ARE THEY SERVER GUYS THAT TAKE CARE  OF YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE?
WELL, IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE PROGRAMMERS. WE HAVE SOME USUAL NON-PROFIT FUNCTIONS, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, FINANCE. SOMEBODY ANSWERS THE PHONES, THOSE KIND OF THINGS. HOW QUICKLY DO THOSE THINGS CHANGE?  IF I WERE GOING TO GO ON THERE TONIGHT AND WRITE THAT I AM, I DON'T KNOW, WATTMAN, HOW LONG  WOULD I LEGITIMATELY BE BATMAN?
WELL, LET'S SAY RIGHT NOW AN ADMINISTRATOR IS CLICKING  PROTECT ON YOUR ARTICLE TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. SO GENERALLY IF YOU GO AND CHANGE WIKIPEDIA, IT WILL BE CHANGED BACK. SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES.
Jon: BUT WHAT... DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT BATMAN?
DO YOU HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE IN
Jon: THAT I'M BATMAN?
THAT'S ALL I NEED.
Jon: WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU. I THINK I'VE JUST FOUND YOUR ACHILLES HEEL. MY SUPERHERO WORKS. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE NOW. IT'S NON-COMMERCIAL, OPEN SOURCE, AND YOU'LL KEEP IT THAT WAY, THE PURITY OF IT.
WE'RE A CHARITY. WE EXIST FROM DONATIONS FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
Jon: WOW. SO NICE TO MEET A VOLUNTEER SUCH AS YOURSELF WORKING ON IT. JIMMY WALES, THANK YOU SO MUCH
