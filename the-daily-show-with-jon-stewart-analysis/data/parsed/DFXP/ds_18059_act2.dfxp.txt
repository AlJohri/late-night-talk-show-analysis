Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY RECOVER  FROM THE SNOWSTORM THERE WITH,  WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, NEMO... START NAMING SNOWSTORMS. ANOTHER DISASTER SENT SHOCK  WAVES THROUGH THE NORTHEAST
DOZENS OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN  DISCIPLINED OVER A CHEATING  SCANDAL THAT HAS ROCKED HARVARD UNIVERSITY
OBVIOUSLY THIS SCHOOL, THE  MOST PRESTIGIOUS IN THE COUNTRY.
Jon: IT IS. JUST ASK ANY ELDERLY JEWISH  WOMAN WITH A GRANDSON THERE. IT'S THE BEST SCHOOL IN THE  COUNTRY. AND HE'S THE BEST BOY THERE. THE BRAIN JACKS AT HARVARD HAD  TO CHEAT. IT HAD TO BE ONE TOUGH EXAM. MAYBE THEY HAD TO SOLVE THE  EQUATION FROM GOOD WILL HUNTING  OR SOMETHING.
OPEN BOOK, OPEN NOTE. OPEN INTERNET.
Jon: DID YOU SAY THE TEST WAS  OPEN INTERNET? AS IN YOU CAN BE ON THE INTERNET  WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THE TEST? IS THIS HARVARD OR THE  UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX? SO THEY COULD USE THE INTERNET  AND THEY STILL CHEATED OFF EACH  OTHER. I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATORS  THROUGH THE BOOK AT THEM AND NOT  SOME E-BOOK THEY FOUND ON THE INTERNET
THE ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD TOOK  THE NECESSARY, THE TIME  NECESSARY DURING THE FALL TO GUARANTEE THAT EVERY STUDENT'S  CASE IS REVIEWED AND RESOLVED  INDIVIDUALLY UNDER THE RULES AND PROCEDURES APPROVED BY FACULTY. THIS IS A TIME FOR COMMUNAL  REFLECTION AND ACTION
Jon: [BLEEP] THAT. THIS IS THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT  WHY THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS  UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED STATES LETS YOU USE THE INTERNET DURING  A TAKE-HOME TEST. FOR GOD'S SAKE, FORGET ABOUT  COPYING OFF EACH OTHER. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT ON  PROJECTS. DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN KEITH  MICHAEL WAS CAUGHT HIDING  PATTERN MAKING BOOKS AND USING THE INTERNET AND THAT GUY WAS  GOOD-BYE. I MEAN HE WAS IN AND THEN HE WAS  OUT. NO NOTHING. I'M NOT SAYING MICHAEL DIDN'T  DESERVE IT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT. THEY WERE ALL VERY DESERVING. ALTHOUGH LAURA, SERIOUSLY, HOW  MANY LITTLE BLACK DRESSES CAN  YOU MAKE IN ONE SEASON? I SHOULD WATCH MORE THAN JUST  SEASON 3, SHOULDN'T I? OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BY THE WAY WHAT TYPE OF CLASS  WOULD TAKE A GROUP OF SMART  PEOPLE WITH POTENTIAL TO COMPETE, DANGLE A FORBIDDEN  FRUIT IN FRONT OF THEM ALMOST  ENCOURAGING THEM TO BE CORRUPT AND THEN FORCE THEM TO DEAL WITH  THE EMBARRASSMENT OF A NATIONAL  MEDIA SCANDAL BECAUSE OF IT ULTIMATELY THEN IMPOSING A  RELATIVELY TOOTHLESS PUNISHMENT?
THE CLASS IS REPORTEDLY  GOVERNMENT 1310 INTRODUCTION TO  CONGRESS. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I RESCIND THE QUESTION. I COMPLETELY GET WHY HARVARD IS  NUMBER ONE. THOSE KIDS ARE GOING TO DO  GREAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
