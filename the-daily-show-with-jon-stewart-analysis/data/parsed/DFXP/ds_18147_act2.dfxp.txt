Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE  PROBABLY GOING TO BE  CREATING SOME BRAND-NEW  VETERANS IN SYRIA, PERHAPS IT IS A GOOD TIME TO CHECK IN WITH  THE ONES WE'VE GOT BACK  HOME. A NEW EDITION OF RED TAPE  DIARIES, AS YOU KNOW THE VA  HAS HAD A PROBLEM WITH  BACKLOGS IN CLAIMS, KIND OF LIKE A HOARDER HAS A LITTLE  PROBLEM WITH PIZZA BOXES  FILLED WITH CAT SKELETONS. BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS!
FINALLY THE BACKLOG IS  SHRINKING. IN THE LAST FIVE MONTH ALONE  IT'S DOWN NEARLY 20%. WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.
Jon: OKAY. DOWN 20%, THAT'S NOT  NOTHING. THAT'S PROGRESS. BACKLOG USED TO BE LIKE THIS,  HERE, THERE, NOW IT'S LIKE  THIS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT MAYBE CUTTING INTO THE  BACKLOG ISN'T SUCH GREAT  NEWS.
IT TURNS OUT THE VA  BENEFITS AREN'T ALWAYS SO  BENEFICIAL.
BACK IN JANUARY WE TOLD  YOU THAT VETERANS IN A  HOSPITAL IN PITTSBURGH KNEW FOR MORE THAN A YEAR THAT IT  HAD AN OUTBREAK OF LEGIONAIRRE'S  DISEASE. THE HOSPITAL KNEW IT HAD AN  OUTBREAK OF LEGIONNAIRES  DISEASE BUT THE HOSPITAL  KEPT IT SECRET UNTIL FIVE PATIENTS DIED AND 21 OTHERS  BECAME ILL.
Jon: HENCE THE PITTSBURGH  VA HOSPITAL SLOGAN I PROMISE  YOU WON'T DIE FROM THE DISEASE YOU CAME IN WITH. (LAUGHTER)  YES, KILLING OFF SOLDIERS  WHO MANAGE TO SURVIVE HITLER  THEN COVERING IT UP, KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE A FIRING OFFENSE. [BLEEP].
RECORDS SHOW HOSPITAL  DIRECTOR TERRY GARRETT WOLF  GOT A 13,000 DOLLAR BONUS THE YEAR THAT PITTSBURGH VA  FAILED TO PREVENT THEN  MISMANAGED THE LEGIONNAIRES  OUTBREAK.
Jon: OKAY. NO, THEIR DEFENSE WE DON'T  KNOW HOW MUCH THEY WERE  GOING TO GIVE HER BEFORE  THEY FOUND OUT. HERE'S YOUR BONUS,  $15,000-- WAIT A MINUTE  THAT'S GOING TO COST YOU. SO I GUESS THE LESSON TO  DISABLED VETERANS IS STAY  OUT OF PITTSBURGH. MAYBE YOU CAN HITCHHIKE TO  ANY OTHER VA HOSPITAL LIKE  BUFFALO JUST A FEW HOURS  AWAY.
THE BUFFALO VA EXPOSED  MORE THAN 700 PATIENTS TO  HEPATITIS OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD BY REUSING INSULIN  PENS. DURING THAT TIME UPSTATE NEW  YORK REGIONAL DIRECTOR DAVID  WEST WAS AWARDED NEARLY $26,000 IN BONUSES.
Jon: THESE VETERANS  SHOULD JUST AVOID THE  NORTHEAST CORRIDOR.
FAILURE TO MONITOR MENTAL  HEALTH PATIENTS AT THE  ATLANTA VA LED TO THREE  DEATHS. WE FOUND ITS FORMER DIRECTOR  JAMES CLARK RECEIVED OVER  31,000 DOLLARS IN BONUSES THE YEARS TWO OF THOSE  PATIENTS DIED.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]. IS THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN  AFFAIRS RUN BY JESSE PINKMAN,  DRIVING AROUND TO RANDOM VA HOSPITALS  THROWING MONEY OUT THE  WINDOW. HEY YOU KILLED THREE VETS KEEP  UP THE GOOD WORK, BITCH! THAT IS MY JESSE PINKMAN  IMPRESSION. (LAUGHTER)  GOING TO AN AMERICAN  HOSPITAL FOR A VETERAN  SHOULDN'T REQUIRE MORE  COURAGE THAN STORMING THE BEACH AT NORMANDY. SO NOW WE KNOW ABOUT THE  PROBLEMS. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO  FIX IT.
LAST YEAR VETERANS  AFFAIRS GAVE OUT NEARLY $97  MILLION IN BONUSES. NOW CONGRESS PLANS TO REVIEW  THE BONUSES GIVEN TO VA  OFFICIALS WHO OVERSAW  HOSPITALS THAT HAD PROBLEMS WITH PATIENT CARE.
Jon: CONGRESS IS ON THE  CASE. WOO-HOO. CONGRESS IS FIXING THE VA  AND AMANDA BYNES IS DRIVING US  ALL HOME, AND JERRY SANDUSKY IS WATCHING THE KIDS  TONIGHT.
