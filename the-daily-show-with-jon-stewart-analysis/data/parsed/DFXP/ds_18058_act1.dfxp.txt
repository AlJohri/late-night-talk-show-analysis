FROM COMEDY CENTRAL EALZ  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW  YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. NICE SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE MAN WHO  HELPED OVERSEE THE NATION'S BANK  BAILOUT AND LIVED TO TELL THE TALE OF IT. NEIL BAROFSKY WILL BE JOINING US  ON THE PROGRAM. WE HAVE A PROGRAM NOTE. LAST NIGHT WE WENT ALL IN ON  PRESIDENT OBAMA, HIS  ADMINISTRATION AND THE SECRECY REGARDING THE SEEMINGLY  AMBIGUOUS AND POWER LOADED U.S. DRONE PROGRAM. YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT AT 11:00  ON THE WAY TO CHECKING OUT TOP  CHAMPIONS. IT'S A SHOW ON THE FOOD NETWORK  BUT IT'S DECEMBER APPOINTING  BECAUSE YOU ARE EXPECTING CHAMPIONS AND -- [LAUGHTER] AT LEAST SHOW THE DOCUMENTS TO  CONGRESS WE PLED TO THE  PRESIDENT. SHOW THEM TO CONGRESS SO THAT  THE TWO OF YOU CAN ABUSE  AMERICAN POWER TOGETHER AS THE FOUNDERS INTENDED. BEFORE WE RELEASE THAT NUGGET  INTO THE -- WHAT IS IT CALLED --  A TV. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS LITTLE PIECE OF NEWS CAME  OUT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DIRECTED  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO  PROVIDE CONGRESSIONAL INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES ACCESS  TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION  PROVIDING THE LEGAL RATIONAL FOR THE DRONE STRIKES.
Jon: THE GUY JUST RUINED  OUR WHOLE (bleep) SHOW. JUST OUT OF THE CLEAR BLUE BOOM! NO WARNING. WHOLE SHOW, BLEW IT UP. [ LAUGHTER ] WE TAPE AT 6:30 AND THERE'S A  FOUR AND A HALF HOUR LAG TIME  BEFORE THE SHOW AIRS. WE DID THAT WHOLE THING. THE REASON WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE  THAT'S HOW LONG IT TAKES  INDUSTRIALITE MAGIC TO DIGITALLY ALTER WHAT I LOOK LIKE IN  PERSON. IT'S CALLED ANDY ROONEY'S  DISEASE. [LAUGHTER] WILL CONGRESS BE ALLOWED TO COPY  AND TAKE NOTES ON THE HIGHLY  CLASSIFIED MEMOS? OF COURSE NOT. WILL CONGRESS BE ABLE TO REFER  TO THE CONTENT OF THE MEMOS IN  PUBLIC? NO. IT'S WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE  BUSINESS AS TECHNICALLY BETTER  THAN NOTHING. WE TAPED AT 6:30. LAST NIGHT WE MENTIONED THIS GUY  FROM THE BUDWEISER COMESH SHASM  WAS -- COMMERCIAL WAS BANGING HIS HORSE. BY THE TIME SHOW AIRED AT 1:00  WE WERE TOLD THE RELATIONSHIP  HAD RUN ITS COURSE AX POLL GIS TO THEM AS WELL. A RESCASMTION OF DRONE --  REEXAMATION OF DRONES IS NOT THE  ONLY THING. THE $85 MILLION ACROSS THE BOARD  SPENDING CUTS THAT CONGRESS PUT  INTO PLACE TO FORCE THEM TO AGREE ON A DEFICIT REDUCTION  PLAN. IT'S A STUPID PLAN. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW WILL THOSE CUTS HELP US?
THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET  OFFICE CAME OUT WITH A REPORT  TEN MINUTES AGO THAT SAID THE EFFECTS OF SEQUESTER WILL BE TO  RETARD GROWTH BY 1.25 PERCENTAGE  POINTS.
Jon: HOW MANY PEOPLE ONLY  TOOK AWAY FROM THAT SOUND BITE  THE WORD RETARD. AND HOW THAT WORD EVEN IF PROPER  CONTEXT SEEMS OFFENSIVE. YOU CAN'T EVEN CALL OUR ECONOMY  RETARDED. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? YOU CAN'T OFFEND OUR ECONOMY. IT WILL HIT THE DEFENSE  DEPARTMENT. HOW DO YOU THINK THE DEFENSE  DEPARTMENT FEELS ABOUT THAT?
IF THESE CUTS HAPPEN THERE LE  BAY DISRUPTION IN DEFENSE AND  SHARP DECLINE IN MILITARY  READINESS.
Jon: YOU CAN PULL TROOPS  FROM GERMANY AND CONSOLIDATE  MIDDLE EAST FORCES AND MOST ARMIES AND GO ALL IN ON THE  AUSTRALIAN CONTENT. THIS IS NOT A GAME. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO IT'S THE GAME THE  WORLD DOMINATION. RISK. THIS IS JON STEWART COMEDIAN AND  DRAWING ROOM EMPEROR. YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M LOOKING TO  KILL EIGHT HOURS, I LIKE TO PLAY  HALF A GAME OF RISK. [LAUGHTER] RISK:  BECAUSE MONOPOLY MOVES  TOO FAST AND ENDS TOO QUICKLY.
THIS IS REALITY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. SETTLE DOWN. DEFENSE BUDGET, WE'RE NOT GOING  TO BE READY TO PROTECT THE  COUNTRY AND DEFENSE SPENDING CUTS WILL HAVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS  AS WELL. FOR INSTANCE, IF THE SEQUESTER  KICKS IN NOT ONLY WILL THE  INTERNATIONAL READINESS BE DEGRADED THINGS LIKE THE BLUE  ANGELS AIR SHOW AND FLEET WEEK  WILL BE CANCELED. NO FLEET WEEK MEANS NO CHER  MUSIC VIDEOS. THAT MEANS SHARES OF MESH THONG  BODY STOCKINGS TAKES A BIG HIT. THAT FACTORY CLOSES THROWS  DOZENS OF LINGERIE WORKERS OFF  THE JOB AND WE'RE FORCED TO WEAR OUR UNDERWEAR ON THE INSIDE. DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES. IS THERE A WAY TO GO THROUGH THE  DEFENSE BUDGET WITH A FINE TOOTH  COMB AND FIND SOME CUTS THAT MAY NOT BE SO DRACONIAN. ADD MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
CONGRESS KNOWS THERE'S NO  EASY ANSWERS. >>S INCUMBENT TO HAVE THE  DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT  WE HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THIS.
BUT 173 CONGRESSPEOPLE FROM  BOTH PARTIES SAID WE DO HAVE THE  MONEY TO BUY 300 NEW AND -- ABRAMS MI1 TANKS AND URGED THE  EXPENDITURE OF $3 BILLION. WHY THE TANKS?
IT SHOWS WE'RE WEAKENING THE  RESOLVE.
ALAN KARUBA EXPLAINS.
WE NEED MORE TANKS FOR THE  SIMPLE REASON THAT WE MAY HAVE  TO USE THEM.
IT'S THE SAME REASON THAT  WHEN YOU ORDER PIZZA YOU ALSO  GET BREDSTICKS AND PASTA AND  WINGS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE LIBERALS WERE  OUTRAGED.
OUR TANK FLEET IS IN GOOD  SHAPE. IT'S FAR BEYOND NOT JUST OUR  FISCAL ABILITY, IT'S FAR BEYOND  OUR NEEDS.
THAT'S RIGHT THE ARMY DOESN'T  WANT ANY MORE TANKS. THE RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL PAUL  EDEN.
TANK WARFARE IS A LOW  PROBABILITY EVENT.
BUT IT'S A PROBABILITY?
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 2400  ACTIVE DUTY M-1 TANKS. NOT THOSE EXTRA 300 CONGRESS  WANTS US TO BUY.
CONGRESS REALLY MUST WANT TO  PROTECT AMERICA.
IT'S A JOBS PROGRAM IN THEIR  EYES.
NO, NOT A JOBS PROGRAM IT'S A  DEFENSE PROGRAM.
WE NEED ENOUGH TANKS TO FIGHT  WHATEVER THE NEXT CONFLICT IS.
IN ADDITION WE HAVE 3,000  TANKS SITTING IN A BONEYARD NEAR  RENO, NEVADA.
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO SEND  MORE?
WHY WOULD YOU SEND MORE TANKS  TO RENO, NEVADA?
HAS NEVADA BEEN ATTACKED?
TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NEVADA HAS  NEVER BEEN ATTACKED.
BOOM. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? WHY 300 MORE TANKS INCLUDING THE  ACTIVE DUTY TANKS ANT 3,000  SITTING IN THE DISEASEERT?
THE RISK OF HAVING LESS TANKS  IS HAVING LESS TANKS.
WELL THAT'S A (bleep).
WELL, I'M NOT A WEST POINT  GRADUATE AND I'M NOT  PARTICULARLY TRAINED IN SUCH  MATTERS. I HAVE A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF  MILITARY ISSUES AND AFFAIRS.
HE MAY NOT BE A WEST POINT  GRADUATE BUT HE DOES KNOW THIS:
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF  WAR YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT UNTIL  YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT.
WHO WILL WE BE FIGHTING IN  THE FUTURE? WE'LL TALK ABOUT HYPOTHETICAL  SITUATIONS.
THE ENTIRE CONTINENT OF  AFRICA BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE  COUNTRIES ARE HEAVILY MUSLIM. AND WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF  MUSLIMS YOU HAVE A LOT OF  PROBLEMS.
MORE MUSLIMS, MORE PROBLEMS.
YEAH, BECAUSE THEIR RELIGION  REQUIRES THEM TO WAGE JIHAD. IF YOU ARE A MUSLIM, UP BETTER  BE OUT THERE JIHADDING AWAY.
WHICH EXPLAINS ALL THE WARS  WE'VE HAD WITH MS. LUMS IN  INDONESIA, INDIA AND DEARBORN,  MICHIGAN. CLEARLY WE NEED NEW TANKS OR NEW  MONEY BUT DON'T WORRY THE ARMY  HAS A GREAT WAY OF RAISING SOME.
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE KEPT  EQUIPMENT COSTS DOWN IS WE SELL  IT TO OUR FRIENDS. THE SAUDIS, KUWAITIES,  EGYPTIANS.
WAITING WE'RE SELLING OUR BAD  ASS TANKS TO MUSLIMS? OUR GENERAL MILITARY ISSUES AND  AFFAIRS EXPERT IS GOING TO FLIP.
SELLING OUR TANKS TO SAUDI  ARABIA IS NOT A LIKELY SCENARIO.
JUST SO YOU WE ARE SELLING  OUR TANKS.
WE ARE?
THAT'S RIGHT.
I DON'T -- I HAVEN'T FOLLOWED  THAT ASPECT OF THE STORY. IF WE'RE SELLING TANKS TO SAUDI  ARABIAANS, GOOD. THEY ARE OUR ALLIES IN SOME  RESPECTS.
SOME RESPECTS, NOT GOOD  ENOUGH. I GOTTA GET RID OF THESE TANKS  BEFORE OUR JIHADI FRENIVE  ENEMIES GET AHOLD OF THEM.
WE HAVE TANKS. AT BIG AL'S TANK EM POREIUM. THEY ARE DO IT ALL. OF COURSE, GETTING TRAFFIC! [LAUGHTER] WE'LL NOT BE UNDERSOLD BECAUSE  I'M ADD MADRIGAL ABOUT TOWN. >>
