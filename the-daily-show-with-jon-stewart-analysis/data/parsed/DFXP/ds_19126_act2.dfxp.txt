Jon: HELLO! WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, SUMMER'S HERE. SCHOOL'S OUT. SOME KIDS ARE OFF TO CAMP. OTHERS MAY BE TAKING A SUMMER JOB. AND, THERE MIGHT BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE THAN YOU THINK. SAM BEE REPORTS.
FARMING, IT'S THE BACKBONE OF THIS COUNTRY, BUT DID YOU KNOW IT BENEFITS WORKERS OF ALL SIZES.
CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS SEVEN ARE LEGALLY WORKING IN U.S. TOBACCO FIELDS.
YES, ACCORDING TO A LOOPHOLE IN OUR AGRICULTURAL LABOR LAWS, OUR HARD-WORKING TYKES ARE FREE TO PICK AS MUCH TOBACCO AS THEY WANT. AND FOR KENTUCKY TOBACCO FARMER AND STATE SENATOR PAUL HORNBACK, IT'S THE BEST THING FOR 'EM.
IT'S LONG DAYS. IT'S IN THE HEAT. IT'S OUT THERE IN THE SUN. SOME DAYS IT MAY BE 100 DEGREES, BUT THAT'S NOT BAD. THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES TO GET SHADE, TO COOL OFF, TO REST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO SAY, "THIS WORK IS TOO DANGEROUS FOR 12-YEAR-OLDS?"
CHILDREN NEED TO EXPERIENCE THINGS.
BUT NOT TOBACCO FARMING, ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT BY HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. AND, THEY'RE PUSHING FOR A LAW TO BAN THE PRACTICE.
WE DON'T NEED MORE LAWS ON THE BOOKS TO TRY TO PROTECT EVERYBODY FROM EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS OUT THERE.
KIDS ARE TOUGHER THAN WE GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR?
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEN I WAS A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD, I WAS WANTING TO WORK. I WAS WANTING TO DO WHAT THE MEN WERE DOING.
HE WAS RIGHT. WORKING ON FAMILY FARM FILLED ME WITH PRIDE. AND NO ONE KNOWS BETTER THAN THESE THREE TOBACCO-PULLING SCAMPS WHO HAVE ENJOYED WORKING ON A DIFFERENT TOBACCO FARM IN NORTH CAROLINA SINCE THEY WERE 12. SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES WORKING ON THE TOBACCO FARMS. I'LL START YOU OFF. YOUR GRAND PAPPY WAKES YOU UP. YOU GET A NICE, NUTRITIOUS BREAKFAST OF FARM FRESH CHICKEN EGGS. MAYBE THE FARMER'S WIFE BRINGS YOU A COOL DRINK OF LEMONADE TO REFRESH YOU.
NO.
DEFINITELY NOT. IT'S TOTALLY THE OPPOSITE.
IT'S REALLY NOTHING LIKE THAT.
NO.
WE'RE NOT THE FARMER'S FAMILY. WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING FOR THE FARMER, AND THEY DON'T EVEN BRING US WATER SOMETIMES. THEY BARELY GIVE US BREAKS.
ALL KIDS COMPLAIN ABOUT WORK.
KIDS DO COMPLAIN A LOT.
WE'RE RAISING A SOCIETY THAT'S TOO SOFT.
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE PUSSIES.
THEY'RE SOFT.
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WON'T SAY IT, BUT JUST NOD IF YOU THINK AMERICA'S CHILDREN ARE PUSSIES.
IT'S SOME OF THE HARDEST WORK THAT YOU COULD EVER DO. BUT, WE TAKE THE SAFEGUARDS. YOU MAY SEE A TEN-YEAR-OLD OUT THERE PICKING TOBACCO, BUT YOU WON'T SEE HIM THERE ALL DAY.
I WORKED 12 HOURS DAY IN THE TOBACCO FARM.
OR SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT LONGER.
OH, AND IS THAT, IS THAT TYPICAL?
FROM THE SUN COMES OUT UNTIL THE SUN COMES DOWN.
HOW MANY SHADY NAPS DID YOU GET TO TAKE TO REFRESH YOURSELF?
I HAVE NOT TAKING ANY NAPS WORKING.
YOU'RE OUT THERE ALL DAY IN THE HOT SUN. IT'S LIKE 100 SOMETHING DEGREES OUTSIDE. >>IT'S LIKE 90 SOMETHING DEGRESS OUTSIDE AND AND WE'RE WORKING.
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING TO SOME TEENAGERS WHO TOOK PRIDE IN THEIR WORK. AND THE KILLJOYS AT HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH DON'T WANT AMERICA'S CHILDREN EXPERIENCING THE PLEASURE OF TOBACCO. WHICH THEY ARE NOT YET LEGALLY ALLOWED TO PURCHASE.
A TOBACCO FARM IS NO PLACE FOR CHILD.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MY SON IS 16 YEARS OLD. AND HE STILL WEARS VELCRO SNEAKERS. I WISH I COULD SEND HIM TO A TOBACCO FIELD TO LET HIM DO AN HONEST DAY'S WORK.
BUT MANY OF THE CHILDREN WE TALKED TO REPORTED SYMPTOM  CONSISTENT WITH ACCUTE NICOTINE POISONING FROM HANDLING TOBACCO PLANTS: NAUSEA, VOMITING, HEADACHES, DIZZINESS.
OH COME ON, HAVEN'T WE ALL FELT DIZZY AND NAUSEOUS WHILE AT WORK?
NO, I DON'T GET SICK AT WORK.
MAYBE YOU NEED TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER. I'M CONSTANTLY THROWING UP AT MY JOB.
I USED TO GET SICK AT LEAST LIKE THREE TIMES EVERY SUMMER.
LIKE SICK WITH EXCITEMENT?
THROW UP. HEADACHE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE WORLD WAS REVOLVING AROUND MY HEAD. I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO DIE.
ACUTE NICOTINE POISONING IS REALLY NOT THAT BIG A PROBLEM. IT'S NO DIFFERENT FROM HAVING A 24-HOUR VIRUS WHERE YOU HAVE A STOMACH VIRUS.
IT'S LIKE ONE COUGH OR FAINTING SPELL OR VOMIT ATTACK AND EVERYONE STARTS FREAKING OUT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW?
AND WE DO THINGS, LIKE WEAR THE PLASTIC GARBAGE BAGS. WE DO THOSE THINGS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH. AND I FURNISH ALL OF THAT.
SEE, OUR CHILDREN ARE ALREADY PAMPERED WITH THE HEFTIEST SAFETY TECHNOLOGY GLADLY PROVIDED WE THE FARMERS. KIRKLAND?
THE FARMER DOES NOT BRING US ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE OUR OWN STUFF.
YES. WE HAVE TO BUY IT OURSELVES GLOVES, BAGS.
OKAY. WOW. YOU'RE MAKING IT VERY HARD FOR ME TO IRONICALLY SUPPORT CHILD TOBACCO LABOR.
WHAT WILL BE NEXT? CAN THEY NOT WORK OUT IN THE HEAT THEN PICKING PUMPKINS? CAN THEY NOT WORKING PICKING GREEN BEANS.
FIRST THEY CAME FOR OUR CHILD TOBACCO FARMERS AND I SAID NOTHING BECAUSE I HAD ACUTE NICOTINE POISONING AND WAS DOUBLED OVER IN PAIN. BUT, LUCKILY FOR PAUL, TOBACCO WORK CAN STILL LEGALLY TEACH OUR CHILDREN ONE INVALUABLE LESSON.
YOU NEVER APPRECIATE A GOOD JOB UNTIL YOU'VE HAD BAD ONE.
YOU'RE SO RIGHT. THOSE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO APPRECIATE THE [BLEEPED] OUT OF THEIR NEXT JOB.
SAMANTHA BEE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
