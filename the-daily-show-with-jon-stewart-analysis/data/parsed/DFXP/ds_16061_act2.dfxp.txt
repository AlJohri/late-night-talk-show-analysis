Jon: WELCOME BACK. OUR CITIES ARE DYING. SADLY EVEN IF WE DO LEGALIZE HEROIN MANY OF THEM SIMPLY CAN'T BE SAVED. JASON JONES FILED THIS HEART- BREAKING REPORT ON A ONCE GREAT AMERICAN CITY RENDERED  UNUNUNWRECKS ON NICEABLE. SFROO SAN FRANCISCO HAS SCHOOLS THAT ARE FACING $100 MILLION IN CUTBACKS AND NOW THERE'S THIS.
SAN FRANCISCO DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT INTO THE TOP TEN ON A NEW SURVEY OF THE GAYEST  CITIES IN AMERICA.
YES, SAN FRANCISCO, THE CITY THAT FLEW THE NATION'S FIRST RAINBOW FLAG AND IS THE  BIRTH PLACE OF THE RUSTY TROMBONE, HAS FALLEN BEHIND ORLANDO, PITTSBURGH AND EVEN ST. LOUIS. THEIR CITY SYMBOL IS A GIANT VAGINA. THE RANKS HAVE LEFT GAY SAN FRANCISCANS LIKE TIM SELIG OUTRAGED.
SAN FRANCISCO IS "THE" INUNDISPUTED LEADER OF GAY CITIES.
YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE NUMBER 11.
NO, WE ARE THE GAYEST.
Reporter: JUST HOW GAY IS SAN FRANCISCO? ONE LOOK AROUND AND YOU SEE THAT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NUMBER ONE IN HACKY GAY PUNS AND  CARTOONISH GAY SEX SHOPS. IF I SQUINT, THAT'S KIND OF GAY.
MAYBE.
WELL, IF YOU TAKE THE GAG OUT AND PUT SOMEBODY'S (BLANK BEEP) IN YOUR MOUTH INSTEAD, IS THAT GAY ENOUGH FOR YOU.
SURE IT'S COLORFUL, FUN, AND FLAMBOYANT BUT THE WHOLE THING SEEMED LIKE A HISTORICAL CREATION OF A BY-GONE GAY CULTURE.
NICE TRY.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IF I'M GAY?
IT WAS LIKE THE COLONIAL WILLIAMS BURG OF GAY. SO WHAT IS THE NEW HOT BED OF GAYNESS? MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE STRAIGHT SENATORS GO THERE TO GET GAY (BEEP) JOBS. GEORGIA MINNEAPOLISIANS ADAM ROBBINS AND JESSE FIELD.
MINNEAPOLIS DESERVES THE RECOGNITION FOR... THAN PEOPLE MIGHT EXPECT.
TAKE ME THROUGH YOUR GAY DAY.
WE GET UP AT 6:00 A.M. AND WE HAD SOME BANANA BREAD THAT I BAKED WITH COFFEE.
OH, THAT'S SO GAY.
AND THEN WENT AND DID SOME ERRANDS.
LIKE WHAT?
WENT AND GOT SOME SHEETS AT BED, BATH AND BEYOND.
THAT'S THE GAYEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD.
Reporter: YES, THEY'RE QUEER AND THEY'RE HERE AND IT  LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S GOTTEN USED TO IT. I WENT OUT CRUISING WITH THESE TWO TO CHECK OUT THEIR SCENE. DO YOU GUYS DO THIS ALL THE TIME?
ALL THE TIME.
WHENEVER WE NEED THINGS.
Reporter: YOU GUYS ARE SERIOUSLY HARD CORE. ALL YOU'RE DOING IS GETTING IN YOUR LITTLE CAR AND GOING TO STAR BUCKS AND BED, BATH  BEYOND AND GOING BACK HOME. IT'S NOT HELPING OUR MOVEMENT. MAYBE THE MOVEMENT HAS ALREADY MOVED. REALLY?
Reporter: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES COULD NOT BE MORE STARK. OLD GAY.
YOU SEE LEATHER, YOU SEE BOAS. YOU SEE NAKED PEOPLE.
Reporter: NEW GAY.
LAST NIGHT WE HAVE OUR WEEKLY CLASSICAL CHINESE READING GROUP.
Reporter: OLD GAY.
IT IS EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL DAY, MORNING UNTIL TONIGHT. GAY, GAY, GAY. IT'S FABULOUS.
Reporter: NEW GAY.
WE'VE JUST BEEN NAMED BEST BIKING CITY IN AMERICA. THE WEEK BEFORE. THAT GOT ME A LITTLE MORE EXCITED.
Reporter: MINNEAPOLIS IS THE NEW GAY.
NO, NO, NO, NO. WE WILL BEAT MINNEAPOLIS.
Reporter: IF WE WERE IN MINNEAPOLIS RIGHT NOW, WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY HAD SEX.
THEN I'M THE LOSER ON THAT PART OF... YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.
Reporter: SAN FRANCISCO IS DETERMINED TO REGAIN ITS GAY THRONE. JUDGING FROM HOW THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THEMSELVES THEY JUST DON'T GET IT. ♪ IF YOU WERE GAY, SHOUT HURRAH ♪♪
Reporter: NOT MINNEAPOLIS GAY. THESE PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY LOST.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JUST (BEEP)?
Jon: JASON JONES.
