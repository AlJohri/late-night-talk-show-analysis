Jon: WELCOME BACK! AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE THE BREAK, DEMOCRATS GOT THEIR ASSES HANDED TO THEM LAST NIGHT. I BELIEVE WE REFERRED TO IT AS SKULL [BLEEP]. BUT EVEN WORSE, THAT IS TRADEMARKED BY THE WAY. EVEN WORSE FOR THE DEMOCRATS, WAS THE DEMOGRAPHIC BREAK DOWN OF THE ASS HANDERS. IOWA HAS ELECTED ITS FIRST STATEWIDE WOMAN, ITS A REPUBLICAN, JONI ERNST.
WEST VIRGINIA HAD ITS FIRST FEMALE U.S. SENATOR.
WE HAD TWO OPENLY GAY CANDIDATES RUNNING AS REPUBLICANS FOR CONGRESS.
TIM SCOTT OF SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE FIRST BLACK SENATOR ELECTED FROM THE SOUTH SINCE RECONSTRUCTION.
IN UTAH, MIA LOVE BECOMES THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN REPUBLICAN TO SERVE IN THE HOUSE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN UTAH REPUBLICAN. THOSE WORDS ARE SO ODD TOGETHER. TRY TYPING IT IN YOUR PHONE. IT AUTO CORRECTS THAT TO APHRODITE CAN WATCH YOU REBA MCENTIRE. IT WON'T EVEN DO IT. IF YOU TRY AND TYPE THAT IN SIRI JUST JUMPS IN WITHOUT BEING PROMPTED AND SAYS I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A HOSPITAL BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HALLUCINATING. AND NOT ONLY DID REPUBLICANS HAVE DIVERSITY THEY HAD YOUTH.
REPUBLICAN TOM COTTON DEFEATING DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT MARK PRYOR.
HE WILL BE THE YOUNGEST SENATOR AT THE AGE OF 37.
NEW YORK'S ELISE STEFANIK BECOMING THE YOUNGEST WOMAN EVER ELECTED TO CONGRESS.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S LEADERSHIP IS GOING TO LOOK OLD AND STALE IN COMPARISON WHERE THE REPUBLICANS ARE.
Jon:  OH PLEASE, OLD AND STALE. COME ON, THEY'RE NOT, OH MY GOD. [LAUGHTER] SOMEONE PUT THE BANDAGES BACK ON THOSE MUMMIES. OH MY GOD. THEY'RE RIGHT, IF THEY WANT TO COMPETE WITH THESE NEW YOUNG REPUBLICANS HARRY REID'S GOING TO HAVE TO GET A COUPLD OF SLEEVE TATTOOS AND A VEST FROM UNIQLO STAT. [LAUGHTER] LISTEN, THAT'S NOT A MOCKUP, THAT'S HARRY REID.  AND HIS BAND. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE REPUBLICANS WERE RUNNING IN ALL AGES AND COLORS AND DEMOCRATS JUST COULD NOT KEEP UP.
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS IS A LATINA. SHE WAS RUNNING AGAINST A DEMOCRAT WHO WAS JUST ANOTHER WHITE GUY.
Jon: AND BY THE WAY, THAT WAS DEFINITELY HER OPPONENT'S MISTAKE TO MAKE THAT HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE, WE'RE JOINED BY OUR SENIOR DEMOGRAPHER JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
Jon:  JESSICA YOU WOULD AGREE, LAST NIGHT REPUBLICANS GAINED AT LEAST SEVEN SENATE SEATS. THEY FIELDED SOME PRETTY DIVERSE CANDIDATES.
JON, REPUBLICANS DIDN'T JUST TAKE DEMOCRAT'S SEATS THEY STOLE THEIR ESSENCE. THE GOP WENT FROM A BROOKS BROTHER'S CATALOG TO UNITED COLORS OF BENETTON AD. IT'S NOT FAIR. I MEAN, HOW WOULD REPUBLICANS FEEL IF DEMOCRATS STARTED DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE OR DECIDED THAT LIFE BEGINS AT IMPURE THOUGHTS.
Jon: NO, I CAN UNDERSTAND. THAT'S -- THEY WOULD BE ANGRY.
YEAH.
Jon: THEY WOULD BE CONFUSED.
OH ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: THEY WOULD MAYBE BE HURT.
EXACTLY. BUT SORRY DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE UTAH JUST ELECTED A YOUNG BLACK CONGRESS WOMAN. CONSERVATIVE ARKANSAS PASSED A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. WHAT THE [BLEEP] KIND OF BIZARRO WORLD IS THIS, JON? I MEAN PRETTY SOON THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE ROCKING THOSE MSNBC NERD GOGGLES. JON, THEY ARE SINGLE WHITE FEMALING THE DEMOCRATS.
Jon:  SO WHAT DO THEY DO, WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THIS HAPPENS. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE IDENTITY POLITICS REALLY OF THE UNDER REPRESENTED. IF REPUBLICANS TAKE THAT, WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LEFT?
THEY NEED TO DIG DEEPER. GET THE MINORITIES WITHIN THE MINORITIES. PANSEXUAL WHOLE FOODS SHOPPERS WITH DREADLOCKS, YOUR KOREAN LESBIAN FLORIST, SO YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE POLITICS ISN'T THE DEMOCRAT'S THING ANYMORE. THEY'RE GREAT AT SOCIAL MEDIA AND RAISING MONEY, SO WHY NOT BECOME A TECH STARTUP AND DEVELOP AN APP,  LIKE AIRDNC IT LET'S YOU STAY IN A DEMOCRAT'S WASHINGTON HOME THAT'S NOW VACANT SINCE THEY LOST THEIR JOBS. BOOM!
Jon:  YOU KNOW THAT -- BOOM IT'S RIGHT. IT HURTS.
TRUTH HURTS.
Jon: THE TRUTH HURTS, JESSICA, AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU DELIVERED THAT AND DROPPED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A MIC FROM YOUR HAND.
ALWAYS.
Jon:  BOOM. LET ME SAY THIS. MAYBE DEMOCRATS NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF TO MOTIVATE THE BASE TO GET THE BLOOD PUMPING THERE.
OH YEAH I WOULD DO IT BUT I'M A REPUBLICAN NOW.
Jon:  WHAT? HEY WHAT?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: WAIT A MINUTE. YOU SUPPORT REPUBLICAN POLICY NOW.
WELL NO, BUT I DO SUPPORT ME WINNING AN OSCAR PLAYING THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN PRESIDENT IN "ROAD TO THE OVARY OFFICE: THE MIA LOVE STORY."
Jon:  THAT'S, THAT'S -- SO THIS IS IT. IT'S OVER. THE REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF MINORITIES NOW.
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT, NO. IT'S LIKE WHEN THERE'S LIKE THIS ACCOUNTANT GUY AT YOUR OFFICE WHO LIKE KEEPS ASKING YOU OUT EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON BUT THEN LIKE ONE NIGHT YOU SEE HIM AT AN EXCLUSIVE PARTY AT THE MOMA AND HE'S WITH SOME CUTE ALT GIRL WITH LIKE PINK HAIR AND YOU'RE LIKE HEY DO YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE I COULD DATE THIS GUY DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AND THEN YOU LIKE TALK TO HIM AGAIN ON MONDAY AND YOU'RE LIKE OH NO I WAS RIGHT THIS GUY [BLEEP] SUCKS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S JUST LIKE THAT.  [LAUGHTER] DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [APPLAUSE]
Jon:  SO THE 2016 DEMOCRATS HAVE A BETTER SHOT AT DATING.
YEAH. I MEAN, NO. WELL MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW JON I'M 25. LOVE IS COMPLICATED.
Jon:  ALRIGHT, THANK YOU. JESSICA WILLIAMS EVERYBODY.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
