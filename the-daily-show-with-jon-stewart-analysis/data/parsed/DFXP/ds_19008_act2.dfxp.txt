Jon: WELCOME BACK. REMEMBER WHEN, REMEMBER WHEN OUR COUNTRY USED TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT? WELL, THAT COULD COME BACK SOME DAY. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A LITTLE ISSUE KNOWN AS IMMIGRATION REFORM. AASIF MANDVI REPORTS.
SOME MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE THINK THAT IT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO FINALLY ENACT SWEEPING IMMIGRATION REFORM. GOING SO FAR AS TO GET ARRESTED FOR THE CAUSE BUT CALMER VOICES HAVE SOME REASONABLE CONCERNS. IMMIGRATION EXPERT DENNIS MICHAEL LYNCH.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING HERE WHO WANT TO COME TO CUT YOUR LAWN AND HAVE A BETTER LIFE. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CUT YOUR THROAT.
YES, NOT JUST ONE TYPE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, THERE ARE TWO.
AN THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL APART.
IN THE EVENT THAT AMNESTY IS OFFERED TO THESE ILLEGALS THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO AMERICA, WE COULD FIND OURSELVES WITH ANOTHER 9/11.
OKAY. LISTEN, STOP SOFT SELLING, GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT.
WE COULD SUFFER ANOTHER 9/11, SOME OF THEM HAVE MACHINE GUNS, OTHER ONES HAVE BIG HUGE PACKAGES IN THE WAY OF DRUGS, YOUR DAUGHTER OR MY DAUGHTER IS BEING RAPED BY A GANG OF THUGS.
I DON'T WANT BY KIDS GETTING HIT BY ANYBODY WHO IS DRIVING A CAR DRUNK, ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY WHO SHOULDN'T BE HERE, WHO DOESN'T HAVE A LICENCE.
RIGHT. IF YOUR KID WAS KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER IT WOULD BE WORSE FOR IF YOU THAT PERSON WAS ILLEGAL.
IT WOULD BE. THAT PERSON WAS HERE ILLEGALLY I WOULD FIND THAT TO BE A PROBLEM.
IT IS A PROBLEM. AND I APPRECIATE YOU NOT OVERSTATING IT.
THE DANGER IS REAL. BUT WHERE IS THE GREATEST THREAT?
EVERYWHERE, FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA.
SO I VISITED A TYPICAL AMERICAN COMMUNITY. SUFFERING UNDER A RECENT INCREASE IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. DAYTON OHIO CITY MANAGER TIM RIORDON.
THE INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS INTO DAYTON HAS BEEN A GOOD THING.
WHAT? DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE GET IN TAX MONEYS FROM THE IMMIGRANTS. THEY CREATE JOBS. THEY CREATE BUSINESSES.
FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THING. THEY'RE ILLEGAL.
I GUESS I'D SAY TO YOU FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THING. THEY'RE TAX PAYING MEMBERS WE DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION.
IDIOTS. DAYTON EVEN HAS A PROGRAM BASED ON NOTHING BUT THE CITY'S ECONOMIC EXPERIENCE THAT ENCOURAGES THE FOREIGN MENACE TO MOVE THERE. DON'T THEY REALIZE THE RISKS?
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ANOTHER 9/11 OR OUR DAUGHTERS TO BE RAPED IF WE LET UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS INTO THE COUNTRY.
WE CATCH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE BAD PEOPLE. WE WANT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND HAVE A BETTER COMMUNITY.
YOU'RE THE ONE CREATING PROBLEMS. I'M TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SIMPLE SOLUTION THAT IS BASED ON FEAR AND HATE.
TRUTH IS, STUDIES SHOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DO MAKE A FEW BILLION SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO STATE AND LOCAL ECONOMIES EACH YEAR. BUT OPPONENTS OF REFORM LIKE DENNIS LYNCH DON'T BUY IT.
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE REPORTS THAT SAY ILLEGALS BENEFIT THE ECONOMY.
I DON'T LIKE TO READ THE REPORTS. I'M NOT A REPORTS GUY.
THE REPORTS BE DAMNED. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION COSTS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
THAT SIMPLE.
YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE MORE COMPLICATED WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THE ECONOMY IN UNTRACKED WAYS. YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH A CALCULATOR, FIGURE THIS OUT.
YOU DON'T NEED A CALCULATOR.
REALLY?
NO. I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH. I GO DOWN TO THE BORDER. I HIDE IN PLACES SUCH AS BUSHES, TO SEE WHAT IS COMING OVER, HOW MANY OF THEM ARE COMING OVER. AND THE NUMBERS ARE BREATHTAKINGLY SCARY.
WITH HIS OWN EYES AND HIS OWN TINY BINOCULARS DENNIS LYNCH HAS SEEN THE TRUTH FIRSTHAND. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE BAD FOR AMERICA. JUST ASK AN EXPERT LIKE SOCIALIOLOGIST DAVE COURT.
I THINK YOU ARE MAKING AN INCORRECT CONCLUSION. IMMIGRANTS AREN'T BAD FOR AMERICA. BUT IN SOME WAYS AMERICA IS BAD FOR IMMIGRANTS.
IN WHAT WAYS?
THEY ARE PICKING UP BAD CULTURAL PRACTICES. AND THEY'RE GETTING FATTER, LIKE AMERICANS. THEY'RE GETTING HIGH RATES OF DIABETES LIKE AMERICANS AND THEY'RE GETTING HIGH RATES OF HEART DISEASE LIKE AMERICANS.
OH MY GOD! THIS TURNS THE WHOLE THING ON ITS HEAD.
TURNS OUT AMERICA IS TERRIBLE FOR THE HEALTH OF IMMIGRANTS. THIS IS THE SOLUTION LYNCH IS LOOKING FOR.
DID YOU KNOW THAT AMERICA IS MAKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FATTER AND LESS HEALTHIER? LISTEN, HEART DISEASE MIGHT DO WHAT A FENCE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD WORK WITH THAT.
OKAY. MY MESSAGE IS NOT ANTI-IMMIGRANT. IT'S PRO-AMERICAN.
COME ON! IT'S GENIUS! INSTEAD OF SCARING AMERICANS ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM, WE USE FEAR TACTICS ON THE IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES. I SET OUT TO SCARE AWAY A GROUP OF WANT A BE CITIZENS IN PLEDGE FORM.
ONE NATION.
ONE NATION.
UNDER MELTED CHEESE.
UNDER MELTED CHEESE.
INDIGESTIBLE.
INDIGESTIBLE.
WITH EXTRA LARGE SODA AND FRIES FOR ONLY 20 CENTS MORE.
AND WITH EXTRA LARGE SODA AND FRIES FOR ONLY 20 CENTS MORE.
YES, TO SAVE ALL THAT WE CHERISH, LYNCH AND HIS ALLIES KNOW THAT EXAGGERATED FEAR IS OUR ONLY HOPE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE HERE.
RIGHT.
WE HAVE FOUND KORANS AND PRAYER RUGS IN THE DESERT. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE FACING THE COUNTRY.
ARE YOU SURE THE PROBLEM IS REALLY ILLEGALS? BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE REACTIONARY FEAR BASED RHETORIC AND THE INABILITY TO COME UP WITH MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SOLUTIONS FOR COMPLEX PROBLEMS.
--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
