[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S THE JUNIOR U.S. SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM SENATOR KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ ♪ KUDOS --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon: THANKS FOR JOINING US. HOW LONG DID YOU HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE SENATE?
JUST TWO YEARS.
Jon: TWO YEARS. IF I MAY AND -- I DON'T MEAN TO EMBARRASS YOU. INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING THE REPEAL OF DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INSTRUMENT --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING THE 9/11 -S FIRST RESPONDERS BILL, INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING THE FOOD SAFETY BILL, INSTRUMENTAL IN THE BAN ON DROP-SIDE CRIBS THAT WERE  HURTING CHILDREN. INSTRUMENTAL IN ILLEGAL DRUGS FROM CROSSING THE CANADIAN BORDER. YOU'VE BEEN THERE TWO YEARS. GILLIBRAND WHAT IS YOUR GAME? YOUR GOAL IN THE SENATE IS TO ENTRENCH YOURSELF AND STAY THERE FOR 60 TO 70 YEARS MOVING AS  LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.
THAT'S TYPICALLY HOW IT'S DONE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO DOES ANYONE SIT WITH YOU IN THE CAFETERIA NOW OR NO? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL GILLIBRAND?
THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES. IF YOU LOOK AT DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL, HOW CAN YOU NOT FIGHT FOR THE INTEGRITY OF THE ARMS  SERVICES, FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING GIVEN THEIR LIVES.
Jon: SURE, IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE IDEA WAS KNEE JERK REACTIONARY MOTIONS TO KEEP POLITICAL POWER, NOT THE PASSING  OF THINGS TO IMPROVE PEOPLES' LIVES. YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN GILLIBRAND. YOU'VE DONE THIS VERY MUCH UNDER THE RADAR OUT OF SPOTLIGHT. IS THIS BECAUSE, AS THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEW YORK, CHUM SCHUMER -- CHUCK SCHUMER IS MADE  OF SPOTLIGHT EATING BACTERIA?
CHUCK IS A GREAT PARTNER. WE WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER.d8 WE WORKED HARD TOGETHER ON THE 9/11 HEALTH BILL. HE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AT THE CLOSING. HE WAS THE CLOSER IN THE DEAL. HE REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE. WE WORK WELL TOGETHER. WE'RE A GOOD PARTNERSHIP.
Jon: THIS LAME DUCK SESSION WAS SO PRODUCTIVE THIS LAST WEEK -- TWO WEEKS WHERE HE GOT  ALL THIS DONE -- WHERE YOU GOT ALL THIS DONE. ARE YOU TEMPTED AS DEMOCRATS TO THROW MORE ELECTIONS --  [LAUGHTER] -- BECAUSE YOU ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE AS -- AND AGAIN PROBABLY NOT FRAMING THIS THE RIGHT WAY. IT'S LOSERS. IS THAT HOW THIS IS? [LAUGHTER]
NO, NO. THESE WERE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR SO LONG. THEY HAPPENED TO COME TOGETHER AT THE END. THE 9/11 HEALTH BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR NINE YEARS.
Jon: BELIEVE ME, LISTEN, I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH IT. I WAS SO GLAD.
DID YOU DO A SHOW?
Jon: WE MAY HAVE DONE A FEW HERE BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE PEOPLE WORKING ON IT --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- AND HAD BEEN DOING IT TIRELESSLY FOR NINE YEARS. THAT'S THE AMAZING THING AND THOSE PEOPLE DESERVE ALL THE CREDIT IN THE WORLD. THANK GOODNESS THE RIGHT THING WAS DONE BY THEM. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WANT, HONESTLY. IF THEY WANT US TO CARRY THEM AROUND I'LL DO THAT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.
THESE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN COMING TO THE CAPITOL WEEK AFTER  WEEK, MONTH AFTER MONTH YEAR AFTER YEAR. THEY WERE THERE FIRST LOOKING FOR SURVIVORS AND REMAINS AND THEY DID THE HARD WORK. THE WORST THING IS THEY ARE LITERALLY DYING BECAUSE OF THE TOXICS THEY BREATHED IN WERE SO AWFUL. THESE ARE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN.
Jon: SUCH GOOD PEOPLE. WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR THIS TO COALESCE? WAS IT IN WASHINGTON WHERE THINGS ARE USED FOR POLITICAL SYMBOLISM BUT WHEN THE ACTUAL  REPRESENTATIVATION OF THAT, THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION SHOWS UP IN THE OFFICE YOU ARE LIKE I  DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE?
NO, IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS LONG. STARTED IN THE HOUSE. THEY WORKED SO HARD. WROTE A GOOD BILL. 21 HEARINGS. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO THE SENATE. SOMETHING SENATOR SCHUMER AND I WORKED ON SINCE LAST YEAR. IT TOOK TIME TO CREATE THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT YOU NEEDED TO PASS THIS KIND OF BILL. IT TAKES TIME.
Jon: TALK ABOUT THE BACKROOM STUFF LAST MINUTE. TOM COBURN PUT A RED FLAG ON IT. HE AND SENATOR ENZI. IT'S YOU AND CHUCK SCHUMER AND ENZI AND COBURN.
AND HARRY REID.
Jon: IS THIS IS AT HOGWARTS OR WHERE DOES THIS DUEL -- WHERE DID THIS TAKE PLACE?
A MEETING IN COBURN'S OFFICE. WE TALKED THROUGH -- THIS IS THE DAY WERE WERE GOING TO PASS THE BILL. WE TALKED THROUGH SOME OF THE CHANGES HE THIS WERE HOPING TO HAVE IN THE BILL. WE REACHED A CONSENSUS. IT BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER. WE WERE HOPING FOR THIS CHRISTMAS MIRACLE WHEN PEOPLE OF GOODWILL COULD COME TOGETHER, COMPROMISE AND GET SOMETHING TO STAND BEHIND THE FIRST RESPONDERS. THAT'S WHAT WE FINALLY DID. IT WAS YEARS OF EFFORT AND SO MANY PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING HAD TO HAPPEN TO MICK IT HAPPEN. I HAVE TO -- MAKE IT HAPPEN. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, JON, YOUR SHOW MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE.
Jon: YOUR VERY KIND TO SAY IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW YOU ARE SHY.
Jon: I --
I KNOW YOU ARE SHY. I KNOW YOU ARE MODEST BUT IT MADE A DIFFERENCE.
Jon: SURE.
LET ME TELL YOU IT PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE THISH ISSUE. IT AFTERNOONIFIED THE WORK -- AMPLIFIED THE WORK THE FIRST RESPONDERS.
Jon: THE IDEA THAT SOMETHINGS THAT BE ON TELEVISION TO MEAN ANYTHING. I'M PROUD OF THE STAFF HERE AND EVERYBODY'S PASSION FOR IT AND  ANYTHING THAT WE DID BUT I FEEL LIKE WE DROVE BY A BURNING CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AND WENT SOMEONE  SHOULD CALL THAT IN. THAT'S WHAThSSTANDING AROUND THE CAR SAY THAT BUT WE HAD A PHONE.
IT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE USING THEIR VOICE. WHETHER YOU HAVE A SHOW WORLDWIDE OR A ADVOCATE KNOCKING ON EVERY DOOR IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE RISING UP, DEMANDING ACTION. YOU DID IT. OUR GREAT NEWSPAPERS HERE IN NEW YORK DID IT. THE "DAILY NEWS" WAS COVERING IT. WE HAD ADVOCATES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THEY SAID THIS IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMAND. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE QhPROUD. THIS IS AN INSTANT WHERE THE PEOPLE STOOD BEHIND THE HEROS AND MADE THE DIFFERENCE TO GET  IT TO THE FINISH LINE.
Jon: YOU DESERVE --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS. IT HONESTLY MEANS THE WORLD TO US. YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH TO GIVE US ONE OF FLAGS. I CAN'T TELL TELL YOU HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO US. YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE FILIBUSTER NOW. YOU ARE GOING TO DO THAT YOU ARE THE WHO IN THE HOTEL. YOU ARE WRECKING THE JOINT. [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU GOING TO CHANGE THE SNB.
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE THE RULES. EVERYONE KNOWS WASHINGTON IS BROKEN. IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR A LONG TIME. THE RULES OF THE SENATE HAVE BEEN MISUSED. THEY'VE BEEN MISUSED SO WE CAN'T PROCEED TO DEBATE ON THE BILL TO  TALK ABOUT THE MERITS OF LEGISLATION. WE WANT TO REFORM THE BILLS.
Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CAN OCCUR?
WILL SOMEONE FILIBUSTER.
WE WANT THEM TO STAND UP UNTIL 4:00 IN THE MORNING AND SAY YOU ARE FOR IT AND AGAINST  IT AND WHY.
Jon: TRANSPARENCY, HOSTEST AT THIS AND ENTHUSIASM. AWR ADORABLE. CONTINUE THE WORK. I MEAN IT YOU'VE DONE A HELL
