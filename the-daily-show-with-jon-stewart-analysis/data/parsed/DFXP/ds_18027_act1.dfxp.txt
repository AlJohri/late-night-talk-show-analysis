Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER A  PROGRAM FOR THIS VERY  EVENING. OUR GUEST TONIGHT DAVID  NASSAW, AUTHOR OF THE NEW  BOOK, THE PATRIARCH, THE  REMARKABLE LIFE AND TURBULENT TIMES OF ONE  JOSEPH P KENNEDY. I THREW IN THE" OF ONE ". (LAUGHTER)  THOUGHT IT GAVE IT A LITTLE  MORE HISTORICAL AUTHORITY. BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ARE  THINKING, ARE YOU THINKING  WHERE THE HELL YOU HAVE BEEN, WHAT DOW GET TEN DAYS OFF  FOR THANKSGIVING? WHAT ARE YOU, A STUDENT AT A  BOARDING SCHOOL? (LAUGHTER)  YES, WE DO GET TEN DAYS FOR  THANKSGIVING. AND NO, STUDENT AT A  BOARDING SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH I DO SLEEP IN A  BUDGET BED AND I AM ON A  FIELD HOCKEY TEAM. (LAUGHTER)  ITS WITH A VERY FUN WEEK  OFF. I SPENT IT LIKE I ALWAYS DO. I TRACK DOWN THE TURKEY  PRESIDENT OBAMA PARDONED AND  I BROUGHT HIM TO JUSTICE! (LAUGHTER)  JUST BECAUSE--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I BROUGHT HIM TO JUSTICE. BECAUSE HIS POWERFUL FRIENDS  IN WASHINGTON PARDONED HIM  DOESN'T MEAN HE WON'T BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE  CRIMES, TURKEY! HERE WE ARE BACK AT THE  OFFICE. ALL FEELING PRETTY RELACKED. YOU KNOW, NOTHING IS REALLY  MORE RELAXING THAN EATING A  LONG AND DRAWN OUT MEAL WITH YOUR EXTENDED FAMILY. (LAUGHTER)  PEOPLE YOU SPEND ALL YEAR  AVOIDING, NOW THEY'RE IN  YOUR HOUSE HOVERING IN THE KITCHEN OPENING DRAWERS. (LAUGHTER)
PITCHING YOU IDEAS. (LAUGHTER)  FOR YOUR SHOW. JONATHAN, I WAS AT THE  BAKERY, AND THE MAN IN FRONT  OF ME SAID WHO'S NEXT? AND I SAID TAKE A NUMBER,  YOU'LL FIND OUT, THAT'S WHAT  WHAT-- YOU SHOULD USE THAT IN ONE OF YOUR SKITS. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S LIKE SEINFELD--   (LAUGHTER)  SO IT'S A LITTLE STRESSFUL. I LIKE BLACK FRIDAY. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE  BLACK FRIDAY, THE DAY AFTER  THANKS GIVING. I DON'T LIKE IT FOR THE  SHOPPING. I LIKE TO DO IT BECAUSE IT  IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO  TAKE OUT THE SUPPRESSED RAGE THAT MY RELATIVES HELP  GENERATE INSIDE ME. AND THEN UNLEASH THAT ON  COMPLETE STRANGERS. (LAUGHTER)  AT A BEST BUY, YOU KNOW WHAT  I MEAN. SO THEY KNOW, I DIDN'T PIN  THE GUY FROM THE GEEK SQUAD  AGAINST THE WALL BY HIS NECK BECAUSE I REALLY CARED THEY  WERE OUT OF 50 INCH PLASMA  TVs. I PINNED HIM THERE BECAUSE  FOR SOME REASON MY FAMILY  THOUGHT MY BROTHER-IN-LAW  COUSIN SHOULD CARVE THE TURKEY THAT I SPENT ALL DAY  COOKING BECAUSE HE'S BEEN  STRUGGLING. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME JUST SAY THIS-- YOU  COOK T YOU KFERB CARVE IT,  JEFF, THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT [BLEEP] IS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW ALL I NEED IS TO GET A  RELATIVE NAMED JACK. NO. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, ENOUGH ABOUT ENDLESS  INTRACTABLE STRUGGLES  AMONGST PEOPLE TO SHARE SIMILAR DNA. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE  EAST. TRANSITION, TRANSITION. ANYWAY, SO WHILE WE WERE  AWAY THE MIDDLE EAST  EXPLODED INTO VIOLENCE,  CENTERING ON THE GAZA STRIP. OKAY, THAT IS--   (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS THE GREAT GAZOO CAN  WE GET A LOCATER FOR THE GAZA STRIP, THAT IS GAGA'S  LIPS. THAT'S NOT-- THAT IS GOSLING  STRIPPED, THAT'S NOT--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  REALLY? ALL RIGHT, FINE, LEAVE THAT  UP. THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING NICE  TO LOOK AT FOR THE TOUGH  STORY. MUST BE WEIRD TO BE THAT  DUDE. (LAUGHTER)  WALKING INTO A ROOM AND  PEOPLE GO-- AAAHHHH! ANYWAY WHAT HAS BEEN  HAPPENING IN THE GOSLING  STRIP.
THE FIRST BUS BOMBING IN  TEL AVIV IN EIGHT YEARS.
ROUGHLY 850 ROCKETS HAVE  BEEN FIRED AT ISRAEL FROM  GAZA.
A SENIOR ISRAELI OFFICIAL  SAYS ISRAEL IS READY FOR A  GROUND INVASION.
WE KNOW TEN MEMBERS OF  ONE FAMILY, ALSO TWO MEDIA  CENTERS.
THAT WAS A RATHER LARGE  EXPLOSION. (LAUGHTER)  AND A RATHER NONPLUSED  REACTION I MIGHT ADD. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ANDERSON  COOPER, DO YOU HAVE TO RUN  TOWARDS EVERY SINGLE DANGER. SOMEBODY GET HIM OUT OF  THERE! TELL HIM THERE'S A TORNADO  HEADED TOWARDS A KNIFE STORE  OR SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I THINK I FOUND A WAY TO  SOLVE THIS CONFLICT. (LAUGHTER)  SOMEBODY NEEDS TO SURRENDER  SOME HOLY LAND. TAKE SOME SOJOURNERS TO THE  DOME OF THE [BLEEP]. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S GOOD. RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF THE  HEAD. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT. SO THE FIGHTING BEGAN LAST  WEEK WHEN HAMAS LAUNCHED  HUNDREDS OF ROCKETS AT  ISRAEL WHICH WERE, I GUESS, IN RETALIATION FOR ISRAEL  KILLING THE HEAD OF HAMAS'S  MILITARY WHICH SOME WAY WAS ACTUALLY A RETALIATION FOR  HAMAS HOLDING AN ISRAELI  SOLLIER HOSTAGE FOR FIVE  YEARS WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN, I DON'T KNOW RETALIATION FOR  ISRAELI SETTLEMENT EXPANSION  WHICH WAS IN RETALIATION FROM WHAT I HEARD-- YOU KNOW  ALSO'S GO BACK TO WHEN THIS  THING STARTED.
Jon: THIS THING HAS GOT  DEEP ROOTS. BUT THIS GO-ROUND ISRAEL HAD  A NEW TRICK UP ITS SLEEVE.
ISRAEL HAS A NEW TOOL IN  ITS MULTIPLAYER MISSILE  DEFENSE SYSTEMNESS WITH THE IRON DOME PROVED ITSELF TO  BE VERY EFFECTIVE.
Jon: IRON DOME THAT  SOUNDS AWESOME. WHAT IS THAT, DON'T TELL ME  WHAT THAT IS YET. JUST-- I'M GOING TO SEE IF I  CAN FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF. YOU SEE IF I'M RIGHT. JUST TELL ME.
THE IRON DOME, ISRAEL'S  HOME GROUP DEFENSE SHIELD.
THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO  PROTECT POPULATED AREAS,  ALLOWING NONTHREATENING SHORT RANGE MISSILES TO DROP  INTO OPEN FIELDS OR WATER  AND INTERCEPTING THOSE  HEADED FOR CITIES-- .
Jon: OH. THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A YAR  MULL CAN-- YARMULKE. (APPLAUSE)  BUT MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM  SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD TOO. HEY, LISTEN F ANYBODY IS  INTERESTED IN MY DESIGN YOU  KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME. HERE WE ARE AGAIN,  THANKFULLY THIS SKIRMISH  ENDED BEFORE IT COULD  FULFILL THE MYAN 2012  PROPHECY.
SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS HAVE  RESULTED IN A CEASE-FIRE IN  THE MIDDLE EAST BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
Jon: YOU KNOW ARE YOU IN  A DIFFICULT PART 69 WORLD  WHEN EVEN THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE FURIOUS. I'LL STOP SHOOTING.
NO, I'LL STOP SHOOTING! THERE IS SUCH A DEPRESSIONING  CYCLICAL STATUS QUO WHERE  THE UNTENABLE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS ARE NEVER  ADDRESSED. THERE ARE NO WINNERS HERE. OR TO PUT THAT A DIFFERENT  WAY.
WHO WAS THE BIG WINNER DO  YOU THINK HERE?
TWO CLEAR WIN ESCHES.
WHO ARE THE LOSERS AND  WHO ARE THE WINNERS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU REALLY MISS THE  ELECTION, DON'T YOU? EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WINNERS  AND LOSERS IN THE HORSE  RACE? EVEN INTRACTABLE BLOODSHED,  JUST ANOTHER CHANCE TO CHECK  THIS ON WHOSE INCREMENTALLY UPPER INCREMENTALLY DOWN. BY THE WAY WINNERS AND  LOSERS, THERE WHAT GAME,  SANDILAND? (LAUGHTER)  HUNGRY HUNGRY HEBREWS? OR MAYBE IT'S THE OLD FAMILY  FAVORITE MONOTONY. WHERE VIOLENCE IS A  DAY-TO-DAY NORM. A GAME WHERE ANGRILY  FLIPPING OVER THE BOARD IS  HOW YOU START. (LAUGHTER)  AND DON'T GET THEM STARTED  ON WHERE YOU CAN PUT UP  HOUSES.
YOU CAN'T PUT UP A HOUSE  ON BALTIC AVENUE, I OWN  BALTIC AVENUE, SPOT CALLING IT BALTIC AVENUE IT'S CALLED  THE DARK PURPLE TERRITORIES  AND IT WAS GIVEN TO MY PEOPLE BEFORE THIS GAME WAS  EVEN INVENTED. NOW GET YOUR THIMBLE OFF MY  SCHNAUZER. NO, NO WINNERS!
THERE IS A MILITARY SIDE  OF THIS WHICH IS ISRAEL  CLEARLY WON.
Jon: OH, YES, ISRAEL  CLEARLY WON, ISRAEL IS IN  GREAT SHAPE NOW. THERE IS NO WINS!
HAMAS EMERGES AS A BIG  WINNER FROM THIS CONFLICT.
HAMAS IS THE WINNER HERE.
Jon: SO ISRAEL WON. AND HAMAS WON. DID I SAY NO WINS. I MEANT TWO WINNERS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A  WINNER HERE, NETANYAHU IS A  WINNER HERE, HILLARY CLINTON IS A WINNER HERE.
EGYPT IS DEFINITELY  EMERGED AS THE WIN NEVER ALL  OF THIS.
Jon: DID ANYBODY LOSE  THIS [BLEEP] THING! DID ANYBODY LOUIS? DID ANYBODY ACTUALLY LOSE IN  THIS BLOODY CONFLICT THAT  KILLED OVER 150 PEOPLE?
THE LOSER IN ALL THIS IS  MAHMOUD ABBAS.
IRAN IS THE MAIN LOSER OF  THIS CONFLICT.
Jon: SO THE ONLY TWO  LOSERS IN THE WAR BETWEEN  ISRAEL AND GAZA ARE THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN  EITHER OF THOSE PLACES. (LAUGHTER)  SO THE LESSON HERE IS THE  NEXT TIME YOUR REGION  DESCENDS INTO A WAR YOU HAVE GOT TO BE IN IT TO WIN IT. WELT ANSWER RIGHT BAC
