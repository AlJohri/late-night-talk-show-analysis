FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS, THE STATE THAT KEEPS THE MEX OUT OF TEX-MEX. IT'S THE DAILY SHOW'S COVERAGE OF DEMOCALYPSE 2014: SOUTH BY SOUTH MESS, ALL YOU CAN VOTE MIDTERM BUFFET. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY EVERYBODY! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY EVERYBODY! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. I'M JON STEWART. DAY TWO AUSTIN, TEXAS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE HAVING A BALL. WE'RE HAVING A BALL. I AM, I AM, I'M GONNA SAY THIS. I AM FULL. I AM FULL. I MAY ACTUALLY SLEEP TONIGHT IN A FLOUR TORTILLA. I MAY JUST GO IN IT AND JUST ROLL UP. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY ASK YOU AT NIGHT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLEEP IN A FLOUR TORTILLA OR A CORN  TORTILLA. WHAT WOULD YOU PREFER? BUT WE HAVE A, WE'RE EXCITED. AUSTIN TEXAS. OUR GUEST TONIGHT'S GOING TO BE REPRESENTING TEXAS' 20th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT JOAQUIN CASTRO WILL BE JOINING US A LITTLE BIT LATER. BUT FIRST, BEFORE WE GET TO THAT. THE PRESIDENT. NOBODY LIKES HIM. EVERYONE HATES HIM. ACCORDING TO GET WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY JOSH EARNEST, THERE ARE REPORTS THAT THE PRESIDENT THINKS HE SHOULD EAT SOME WORMS. EVEN DEMOCRATS RUNNING FRANTICALLY FROM BARACK OBAMA LIKE HE WAS THE BAD GUY IN ONE OF THOSE CHAIN SAW MASSACRE MOVIES YOU HAVE HERE EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014: POTUS PARTEM DEPRESSION. HOW TOXIC IS THIS PRESIDENT? ENOUGH TO TURN EVEN THE MOST INNOCUOUS OF QUESTIONS INTO A GOTCHA. KENTUCKY SENATE CHALLENGER ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES.
DID YOU VOTE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA 2008, 2012?
YOU KNOW, THIS ELECTION ISN'T ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. IT'S ABOUT --
I KNOW. BUT DID YOU VOTE FOR HIM? DID YOU VOTE FOR HIM?
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE -- I WAS ACTUALLY AN '08 DELEGATE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ANSWER.
AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ON THE BALLOT.
Jon: THAT LOOKED LIKE A DEPOSITION FROM A MURDER TRIAL. PRESIDENT WHO? I LOVE HOW THE REPORTER JUST, WELL, WAS HE ON THE BALLOT? HOW ABOUT THIS? [BLEEP] MARRY OR VOTE FOR BRAD PITT, GEORGE CLOONEY, BARACK OBAMA. WHAT? GO. ALRIGHT, SO CLEARLY OBFUSCATION IS ONE WAY TO AVOID DESTROYING YOUR CAMPAIGN BY ASSOCIATING IT WITH THE LEADER OF YOUR PARTY. WHEREAS ARKANSAS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK PRYOR WENT FOR THE DELAY OF GAME PENALTY.
DO YOU THINK THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE AN APPROPRIATE JOB HANDLING THE EBOLA CRISIS?
I WOULD SAY THAT -- IT'S HARD TO KNOW BECAUSE. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: YOU ARE ACTING LIKE SHE FOUND YOUR PORN. IS THIS YOUR PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE? UHHH -- NOOOO. I WOULD SAY -- ARE YOU ASLEEP YET? [LAUGHING] EVEN THOSE WHO MANAGED TO ADMIT THAT YES, THEY DID VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT CAN'T EVEN SEEM TO SUMMON THE COURAGE TO STAND BEHIND THE DECISION.
SENATOR MARK BEGICH TELLING THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER I DID, MEANING VOTE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA. BUT THAT'S IRRELEVANT. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT RELEVANT. HE'S GONE IN TWO YEARS.
Jon: TWO YEARS. HE ONLY HAD A FOUR YEAR TERM! TWO YEARS IS HALF HIS TERM. THE REST OF THE SUPER BOWL ISN'T RELEVANT. IT WILL BE GONE IN TWO QUARTERS. I'M NOT -- HOW IRRELEVANT IS THE PRESIDENT? IRRELEVANT ENOUGH THAT EVEN HIS OWN PRESS SECRETARY WON'T MENTION HIM DURING A SPIRITED DEFENSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S RELEVANCE.
SENATOR BEGICH IS CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION, BUT I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD AGREE THAT WHOEVER THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAPPENS TO BE IS RELEVANT IN A LOT OF IMPORTANT WAYS.
Jon: WHETHER THAT SITTING PRESIDENT HAPPENS TO BE ABRAHAM LINCOLN OR AS IS THE CASE NOW PRESIDENT CURRENT OCCUPANT. NOW THE ENVIROMENT, THE ENVIROMENT FOR DEMOCRATS THE ENVIRONMENT FOR DEMOCRATS IS SO BAD RIGHT NOW THAT IN KENTUCKY THEIR SENATE CANDIDATE ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES IS LOSING TO A GUY WHO HAS TO RECRUIT ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTSERS THE SAME WAY YOU HAVE TO RECRUIT PEOPLE TO A TIME SHARE PRESENTATION.
ALL EXPENSES PAID TO CHEER ON SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL.
AN E-MAIL FROM MCCONNELL'S CAMPAIGN STAFF ASKS FOR VOLUNTEERS TO JOIN HIM ON A BUS TRIP THIS WEEK AND HELP CONTRIBUTE TO AN ENTHUSIASTIC ATMOSPHERE AT CAMPAIGN EVENTS. THE MEMO SAYS THE TRIP IS FREE. MEALS, TRANSPORTATION, HOTELS FOR TWO NIGHT TAKEN CARE OF.
Jon: HANDS OFF THE MINIBAR. [LAUGHING] THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. THIS GUY HAS BEEN IN THE SENATE FOR 30 YEARS. HE'S ABOUT TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE. HE'S GOT TO BUY FRIENDS AND MANIPULATE HIS LIKABILITY.
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE TRY TO TELL ME HOW TO DO MY COMMERCIALS. HEY MITCH, WHAT ABOUT USING A TALKING BABY. THAT'S BEEN DONE BEFORE.
WELL AND WITH YOU AND BLOODHOUNDS.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS ISN'T SUCH A BAD IDEA. I'M MITCH MCCONNELL AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. [LAUGHING]
IT TURNS -- IT TURNS OUT, EVEN THROUGH LINEN PANTS A BLOOD HOUND'S TONGUE FEELS PRETTY GOOD ON THE TESTICLES. PRETTY GOOD INDEED. LIKE A SAND PAPER BATH FOR YOUR BALL SACK. IT'S PRETTY, PRETTY --  BUT NOTHING BETTER ILLUSTRATES THE TURD HOLE THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN RIGHT NOW THAN NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATE RACE BETWEEN SCOTT BROWN AND JEANNE SHAHEEN. THIS BROWN-SHAHEEN RACE HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLE. AND BY THE WAY, IF THERE ISN'T ALREADY A BROWN SHAHEEN IN URBAN DICTIONARY, I'M SURE THERE IS NOW. HOW'S THAT RACE SHAPING UP?
A NEW CNN RESEARCH POLL SHOWS THAT THE RACE IS EXTREMELY TIGHT. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN LEADS REPUBLICAN SCOTT BROWN BY TWO POINTS. 49-47% AMONG LIKELY VOTERS. A STATISTICAL TIE AFTER THE MARGIN OF ERROR IS INCLUDED.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]? JEANNE SHAHEEN IS THE INCUMBENT. SHE'S GOT HIGH FAVORABLES. SHE'S POPULAR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. SHE'S A POPULAR FORMER NEW HAMPSHIRE FORMER GOVERNOR. HER NAME IS 10 TIMES FUNNER TO SAY THAN SCOTT BROWN. SHAHEEN MACHINE! SHE IS A WOMAN SO NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT EVEN A SNOW SHOE WEARING SLAB GRANITE COVERED IN BEAUTIFUL FALL FOLIAGE IS LIKE, WE GET IT YOU'RE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. AND SHE'S STATISTICALLY IS TIED WITH THIS GUY.
SCOTT BROWN WAS, OF COURSE, ASKED ABOUT BEING A CARPET BAGGER AND CROSSING THE BORDER IN MASSACHUSETTS. AND HIS COMMENT HAS DRAWN A LOT OF ATTENTION. HE SAID DO I HAVE THE BEST CREDENTIALS? PROBABLY NOT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WHATEVER. BUT I HAVE LONG AND STRONG TIES TO THE STATE.
Jon: PROBABLY NOT. WHAT? WHAT THE WHAT? PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHATEVER. [LAUGHING] ARE YOU RUNNING FOR SENATE OR ANSWERING WHETHER OR NOT MILEY IS GETTING BACK WITH LIAM. SEEMS PRETTY CAVALIER FOR SOMEONE SO CONCERNED WITH AMERICA'S SECURITY.
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS ARE THREATENING TO CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF OUR COUNTRY. THERE'S DEEP CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS OF ISIS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH THE BORDER RIGHT NOW.
I WANT TO SECURE THE BORDER AND KEEP OUT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO US HARM.
Jon: I MEAN, I KNOW HOW POROUS NEW HAMPSHIRE BORDER'S ARE. I'M NOT EVEN FROM HERE AND I'M ALMOST YOUR SENATOR. AND BY THE WAY, SCOTT BROWN HAS ALREADY BEEN A SENATOR. SO HOW WAS SCOTT BROWN'S BORDER VIGILANCE WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR? THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTS TODAY THAT BROWN MISSED ALL SIX HEARINGS ON BORDER SECURITY WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETS. SHAHEEN IS TIED WITH THAT GUY. THAT GUY. BUT THAT'S WHERE THE DEMOCRATS ARE AT. NECK AND NECK WITH A REPUBLICAN WHO ADMITS HE'S NOT THE BEST CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR THE SENATE IN A STATE HE'S NOT FROM, ON A ISSUE HE IGNORED WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR FROM THE A DIFFERENT STATE. MY ADVICE TO DEMOCRATS THIS ELECTION SEASON, GRAB SOME PEANUT BUTTER AND SOME OF THEM BLOOD HOUNDS. IT'S NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANY VOTES BUT SURE WILL FEEL NICE. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
