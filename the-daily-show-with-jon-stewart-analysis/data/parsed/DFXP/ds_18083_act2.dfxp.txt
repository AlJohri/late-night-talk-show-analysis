Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT HE WAS THE  39th PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED  STATES. HE IS HERE TO DISCUSS HOW HIS  NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THE  CARTER CENTER HAS NEARLY ERADICATED THE GUINEA WORTH  DISEASE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER. HOW ARE YOU, SIR? NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO BE BACK.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT I DIDN'T  REALIZE. OKAY, SO YOU HAVE THIS THING  THAT YOU START IN 1986.
RIGHT.
Jon: THE CARTER CENTER. THEY SAY THIS GUINEA WORM IS A  PROBLEM. I CAN'T DO IT JUSTICE.
IF YOU DRINK OUT A WATER HOSE  IT BUILDS UP DURING THE RAINY  SEASON AND STAYS DRY. YOU DRINK THE GUINEA WORM EGGS  AND IN A YEAR'S TIME IT GROWS  INTO A WORM 30 INCHES LONG AND STAYS INSIDE YOUR SKIN EP DERMIS  AND TAKES A SORE. IT EMERGES. TAKES 30 DAYS TO COWMENT AND  DESTROYS MUSCLE TISH GREW.
Jon: AND TERRIBLE PAIN.
ALMOST INDECEMBER SCRIBABLE  PAIN.
Jon: YOUR PEOPLE SENT ME A  DEAD GUINEA WORM.
I BET -- I'M GLAD IT'S DEAD,  YEAH.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS  LIKE. THAT IS THE THING THAT COMES OUT  OF PEOPLE -- OFTEN TIMES THEIR  FEET OR TOES.
FEET, TOES,, THE FIRST TIME I  SAW IT ONE WAS COMING OUT OF A  NIPPLE OF A WOMAN'S BREAST.
Jon: TERRIBLE THING N.1986  WHEN YOU BEGIN THIS PROGRAM, HOW  MANY CASES OF GUINEA WORM ARE OCCURRING THROUGHOUT WHERE IS IT  MOSTLY ASIA, AFRICA.
THREE COUNTRIES IN ASIA AND  17 IN AFRICA, SUBSAHARA. WE FOUND THEM IN VILLAINS AND  HAD THREE AND A HALF MILLION  CASES.
Jon: 3.5 MILLION CASES.
THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND.
Jon: 1986 TO NOW IS NOT --
LAST YEAR WE HAD 542 CASES.
Jon: 542 FROM 3.5 MILLION.
RIGHT. AND 521 OF THOSE CASES WITH IN  SOUTH SUEDAR. THIS YEAR SO FAR WE JUST HAVE  SEVEN CASES. ALL OF THEM --
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE CRAZY PART. HERE IS THE THING. WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THESE  TYPES OF SCOURGES THAT HIT THE  AREAS AND WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THE RIGHT MEDICINE AND THE DRUG. AND WE HAVE TO CREATE SOME SORT  OF -- HOW WAS THIS SOLVED?
NO MEDICINE TO PREVENT IT OR  CURE IT. FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THEY  WRAPPED THE GUINEA WORM ON A  STICK SO IT WOULD COME OUT IN 20 DAYS INSTEAD OF 30. YOU HAD TO SUFFER THREE WEEKS. WE FOUND IF YOU POUR THE WATER  THROUGH A FILTER IT GETS OUT THE  EGGS AND DRINK YOUR FILTERED WATER WITHOUT THE GUINEA WORM  EGGS AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
Jon: EDUCATION. YOU WON'T THERE AND THEY SHOWED. WERE THEY RESISTANT TO --
SOME OF THEM WERE BECAUSE THE  MEDICINE WERE MAKING A LOT OF  MONEY TREATING IT.
Jon: SURE.
AND THEY THOUGHT A POND WAS  SAFE. FIT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE POND  THAT THE VILLAGE WOULDN'T BE  THERE. WE WERE INSINUATING IT CAME FROM  THE SACRED POND. IF YOU HOLD UP THE GLASS YOU CAN  SEE THE THINGS SWIMMING AROUND. WE EVENTUALLY SHOWED THEM THE  THINGS IN THE POND AND THEY LET  US PROVIDE THE FILTER. WE HAD TO GO TO EVERY SINGLE  VILLAGE ON EARTH THAT HAD THE  DISEASE. WE FEEL WE HAVE PREVENTED ABOUT  80 MILLION CASES OF GUINEA WORM  SINCE WE FIRST STARTED.
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. DO THEY NOW CREATE --
DUPONT GIVE OF GAVE US A  SPECIAL FILTER THAT WOULDN'T ROT  IN THE TROPICS. IT HAD TO BE OFTEN WITH BY  PEOPLE THAT MAKE PARACHUTES.
Jon: YOU'VE ERADICATED IT.
WELL, ALMOST.
Jon: BILL GATES IS OUT  THERE WITH MALARIA. DO YOU RIB HIM A LITTLE BIT? HOW IS IT GOING? MALARIA?
WE WORK ON THAT, TOO. WE DON'T BRAG BECAUSE WE GET A  LOT OF MONEY FROM THE BILL GATES  FOUNDATION.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT  THEY ARE VERY GOOD PEOPLE.
REALLY ARE. ONE OF HIS GREATEST ADMIRERS.
Jon: WHEN YOU BUILD THEIR  TRUST ARE THEREOTHER THINGS YOU  WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE  VILLAGES?
WE GO OUT IN THE JUNGLE AND  IN THE DESERT AREAS THAT NOBODY  ELSE WANTS TO GO. THEY CALL THESE NEGLECTED  DISEASES BECAUSE NOBODY --
Jon: DISEASES OF SANITATION  AND SIMPLE -- ONE OF DISEASES  THAT COMES FROM FLIES AROUND YOUR EYES CAUSES BLINDNESS. WHEN YOU GO TO A VILLAGE AND YOU  SEE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE  DISTANCE YOU THINK THEY ARE WEARING EYE GLANCES AND YOU GET  CLOSE IT'S FLIES ON THEIR EYES  ALL THE TIME. THE EYE GETS INFECTED AND THE  UPPER EYELID TURNS INWARD AND  EVERY TIME YOU BLINK IT CUTS THE  CORNEA.
Jon: HOW DO YOU DO IT THAT?
WE TEACH THE KIDS TO WASH  THEIR FACES WHICH THEY NEVER  TRIED BEFORE. WE TEACH THEM. AND IN CERTAIN PARTS OF AFRICA A  WOMAN IS ABSOLUTELY PREVENTED BY  TABOOS FROM RELIEVING HERSELF IN THE DAY TIME. THEY HAVE TO HIDE AND DEFECATE. WE TAUGHT THEM HOW TO BUILD AN  OUTDOOR TOILET THAT ONLY COST $1  IF YOU DO THE WORK THEMSELVES. WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE 1,000. WE JUST FINNED 2 MILLION 300,000  LATRINES IN AFRICA.
Jon: INCREDIBLE.
I'VE BECOME FAMOUS AS THE  NUMBER ONE LATRINE BUILDER IN  THE WORLD. I'M NOT FAMOUS FOR PEACE BETWEEN  ISRAEL AND EGYPT BUT, YOU KNOW?
Jon: MAYBE THEY CHANGE THE  NAME TO THE JIMMY INSTEAD OF THE  JOHN. [LAUGHTER] WE'LL TALK ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS  RIGHT AFTER THIS. [CHEERS AND APPL
