Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY  NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, WARREN BUFFETT  AND FINANCIAL JOURNALIST CAROL  LOOMIS. THEY ARE ON THE SHOW TONIGHT AND  -- TONIGHT MEETING FOR THE FIRST  TIME ON THIS SHOW. (LAUGHTER)  THEY WROTE A BOOK TOGETHER,  ACTUALLY. AS YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S ONE  THING ALL AMERICANS CAN AGREE  ON, WE LOVE BLACK FRIDAY. WHETHER YOU'RE A FAN OF SHOPPING  OR TRAMPLING. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH IS WHY I WAS JUST -- I WAS  SO UPSET TO SEE ON THIS HOLIEST  OF DAYS A NEWS STORY ABOUT PEOPLE PROTESTING IN FRONT OF  THEIR LOCAL WAL-MART.
THOUSANDS OF WAL-MART  EMPLOYEES ARE STAGING WALKOUTS  AND PROTESTS OVER THIS HOLIDAY  WEEKEND. THE WORKERS ARE UPSET ABOUT  HAVING TO WORK ON THANKSGIVING  DAY AND THEY'RE ALSO SPEAKING OUT FOR BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS.
Jon: WHAT? (LAUGHTER)  YOU GET TO WORK AT WAL-MART ON  THANKSGIVING DAY! (LAUGHTER)  A RING SIDE SEAT TO THE GREATEST  SHOW ON EARTH.
I IT'S A BLACK FRIDAY  TRADITION.
(BLEEP). I'LL STAB ONE OF YOU MOTHER  (BLEEP)  (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH  PEOPLE PAY TO GO TO FIGHTS LIKE  THAT? (LAUGHTER)  YOU GET PAID -- SOME -- TO SEE  IT. (LAUGHTER)  ISN'T THAT BENEFIT ENOUGH? TRULY YOUR VEST RUNETH OVER. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU,  GREEDY HOURLY SLIGHTLY OVER THE  FEDERAL POVERTY LINE EMPLOYEES. (LAUGHTER)  NOW YOU WANT TO UNIONIZE! BESIDES, EVERYONE KNOWS  COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING IN THE  WAL-MART WORLD YOU'VE GOT IT PRETTY GOOD.
VIOLENT PROTESTS IN  BANGLADESH THIS MORNING AFTER A  DEADLY GARMENT FACTORY FIRE. SATURDAY'S FIRE KILLED AT LEAST  112 FACTORY WORKERS. THE FACTORY IS OWNED BY AN  EXPORTER WHOSE CLIENTS INCLUDE  WAL-MART.
Jon: SEE? (LAUGHTER)  WAH-WAH! "I WORK AT WAL-MART IN THE  UNITED STATES! I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE MY KIDS  TO THE DOCTOR!"  WELL, AT LEAST WHERE YOU WORK  THERE ARE EXITS! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  AND THE WORST PART OF THAT FIRE  --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE WORST PART OF THAT FIRE IS  THE DEVASTATING IMPACT THAT IT'S  GOING TO HAVE ON WAL-MART.
THIS IS A BIG GIANT PRIZE FOR  UNIONS. THIS IS A BIG GIANT PRIZE FOR  THOSE WHO ARE ANTI-CAPITALISM. IF IT'S NOT THIS, IT WILL BE  SOMETHING ELSE.
I THINK IT'S A STRETCH, AN  AMAZING STRETCH, TO TRY TO PIN  THIS ON WAL-MART. I CAN'T THINK OF A WORSE TARGET.
Jon: OH, I ACTUALLY -- I  BELIEVE THAT'S WAL-MART'S  SLOGAN: "THINK OF A WORSE TARGET."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YEAH, THAT WAS JOE. JOE CAME UP WITH THAT IN THE  MEETING AND WE'RE ALL LIKE  "WE'RE USING THAT."  (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY. YOU WERE BEING CALLUSLY  DISMISSIVE ABOUT THE WORKING  CONDITIONS IN BANGLADESH TO SCORE POINTS AGAINST AMERICAN  UNIONS. CONTINUE.
DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE  IN BANGLADESH WHO PERISHED  DIDN'T WANT OR NEED THOSE JOBS AS WELL. I KNOW WE LIKE TO VICTIMIZE  EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY,  PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE POOR PROFIT MOTIVATION WHICH  IS BEING ASSAULTED.
AGAIN, IT'S TRAGIC AND IT'S  ONE OF THE THINGS I DON'T THINK  SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL HAPPEN  AGAIN.
Jon: OKAY, THAT'S A RELIEF. (LAUGHTER)  YOUR FIRST ARGUMENT APPEARS TO  BE "YES, OKAY, THEY DIED IN A  FIRE BUT THEY HAD JOBS!" (LAUGHTER)  I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO  ASSUME YOUR JOB WON'T ENTAIL  SOME KIND OF INFERNO UNLESS IT'S MENTIONED IN THE AD WHICH IS --  OH, OKAY, WELL, THAT -- I DIDN'T  REALIZE. NOW YOUR SECOND ARGUMENT IS THIS  --  (APPLAUSE). YOUR SECOND ARGUMENT APPEARS TO  BE -- YOUR SECOND ARGUMENT IS,  "HEY, MAN, THIS IS JUST A ONE-OFF."  WHICH COULD BE A POWERFUL  HYPOTHETICAL ARGUMENT THAT I  MIGHT BUY INTO IF MOMENTS EARLIER THE GIANT GRAPHIC NEXT  TO YOUR HEAD HAD NOT MENTIONED  THE 500 PEOPLE OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES KILLED IN GARMENT FIRES. ALTHOUGH PERHAPS YOU'RE JUST  SAYING THIS TYPE OF FIRE WON'T  HAPPEN AGAIN IN THIS PARTICULAR NOW BURNED-DOWN FACTORY. (LAUGHTER)  TO WHICH I WOULD SAY TOUCHE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT I GUESS THE POINT IS UNIONS  WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO DESTROY  OUR WAY OF LIFE. AND WAL-MART IS NOT THE ONLY  AMERICAN TREASURE ON THEIR HIT  LIST.
IF YOU LOVE TWINKIES, SORRY,  BRACE YOURSELF FOR THIS ONE.
Jon: LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT  THERE. (LAUGHTER)  IF YOU LOVE TWINKIES YOU ARE  PROBABLY ALREADY USED TO BEING  TOLD TO BRACE YOURSELF FOR BAD  NEWS. (LAUGHTER)  ONLY USUALLY IT'S FROM A GUY WHO  LOOKS LIKE THIS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT, ALL RIGHT. CONTINUE.
IF YOU LOVE TWINKIES, SORRY,  BRACE YOURSELF FOR THIS ONE. TIME HAS RUN OUT FOR AMERICA'S  ICONIC BAKING COMPANY.
AFTER 82 YEARS, HOSTESS IS  SHUTTING DOWN FOLLOWING A  BANKRUPTCY FILING.
NO MORE TWINKIES, NO MORE  HO-HOES, NO MORE SNO BALLS.
Jon: NO MORE RING DINGS, NO  MORE DING-DONGS, NO MORE DONG  RINGS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  OH, MY GOD, THAT'S NOT CREAM. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  HOSTESS WILL -- IT'S JELLY. (LAUGHTER)  (SIGHS)  HOSTESS WILL BE NO MORE! OH, NO! WHERE WILL I GO NOW FOR MY  STOMACH ACHES AND  SELF-MEDICATION? WHERE WILL I GET THE CRAP TO  FILL THE BOTTOMLESS PIT IN ME  THAT WILL NEVER BE FILLED. BOXED WINE? ARBY'S? I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE! (LAUGHTER)  WHAT COULD HAVE DESTROYED THIS  BELOVED AMERICAN DIABETES  DISPENSARY.
IT'S THE UNIONS THAT REALLY  DID IT IN BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT  ALLOW HOSTESS TO OPERATE  EFFICIENTLY.
HOSTESS, WHICH WAS FORCED TO  CLOSE ITS DOORS DUE TO UNION  DEMANDS, THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO STAY IN BUSINESS DURING A LONG  WORKER STRIKE.
THE UNION PREFERRED KILLING  THE COMPANY TO ACCEPTING WHAT  THEY THOUGHT WAS A BAD DEAL.
Jon: UNIONS! YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE GINGRICH  IS TAKING THIS HARD. HE IS, AFTER ALL, HALF STPHO +  BALL ON HIS FATHER'S SIDE. (LAUGHTER)  JUST TO PLAY DEVIL DOG ADVOCATE  HERE, COULD THERE BE ANOTHER  REASON HOSTESS WENT BANKRUPT?
THIS COMPANY COULD NOT RUN  ITSELF EFFICIENTLY. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THEY'VE  HAD SEVEN C.E.O.s.
Jon: OH, UNCERTAINTY. I'M TOLD THE MARKET ABHORS IT.
AFTER THE 2004 BANKRUPTCY,  THE WORKERS TOOK WAGE AND  BENEFIT CUTS. IT WASN'T ENOUGH. THE C.E.O. GAVE HIMSELF A 300%  RAISE.
Jon: SO THE UNIONS HAD  ALREADY TAKEN A CUT IN SOMEWHAT  INVERSE VERSE PROPORTION TO THE SECECI OWE'S RISING COMPENSATION  WHICH HE DESERVES FOR CONVINCING  TO UNION TO TAKE THAT CUT. ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN UNIONS UNIONS  THAT COULD HAVE SABOTAGED THE  COUNTRY?
SALES DROPS AS MOM SWAPPED  OUT THE FAT-FILLED GOODIES AND  WHITE BREAD FOR HEALTHIER LUNCHBOX FOODS.
Jon: (BLEEP)ING MOMS. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW DARE YOU, MOMS? YOU KNOW, MAYBE I JUST LOVE  AMERICA THIS MUCH, BUT I SAY LET  MARS HAVE THEM! (LAUGHTER)  IT'S A "MARS NEEDS --" I SEE A  LOT OF CHILDREN'S MOVIES BECAUSE  I HAVE CHILDREN. YOU KNOW WHAT I ALSO THINK-- AND  THIS IS JUST A MARKETING TIP--  LET'S NOT FORGET THE HOSTESS MASCOT IS SOME KIND OF HIGH  SPIRITED COUNTRY WESTERN DILDO. (LAUGHTER)  BUT AS ALWAYS THE REAL VICTIMS  HERE BE THE CHILDREN.
IT'S SAD THEY'RE NOT GOING TO  KNOW WHAT TWINKIES ARE. THEY'RE GOING TO GROW UP NOT  KNOWING WHAT TWINKIES ARE. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, EACH GENERATION HAS  ITS BURDENS, MY KIDS MIGHT NEVER  KNOW THE PLEASURE OF DOING DOUGHNUTS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL  PARKING LOT IN AN A.M.C. GREMLIN. I GREW UP NOT KNOWING POLIO. YOU GET BY. (LAUGHTER)  IF WE'RE REALLY CRAVING A HIT OF  TWINGE, WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE OUR  OWN.
THERE ARE 37 INGREDIENTS IN  THIS LITTLE CAKE. MANY YOU'D EXPECT, SOME FLOUR,  LOTS OF SUGAR, CORN SYRUP. BUT HOW ABOUT CORN DEXTRIN? THAT'S THE STICKY GLUE FOUND ON  THE BACK OF ENVELOPES AND THAT  SMOOTH CREAMY CENTER? IT'S MADE FROM CELLULOSE GUM. THAT'S USED IN HAIR GEL,  SHAMPOO, EVEN ROCKET FUEL.
Jon: ROCKET FUEL! THAT EXPLAINS THE BLUE FLAME  THAT SHOOTS OUT OF MY ASS  WHATEVER I EAT A TWINKIE! RECTUM, WE HAVE A PROBLEM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH? WHEN I WAS MAKING MY TWINKIES I  FORGOT THE CELLULOSE GUM. OH, I'M AN IDIOT! I MADE MYSELF A TWINGE KEY USING  ONLY 36 INGREDIENTS. IT PROBABLY WON'T MAKE THAT BIG  A DIFFERENCE. IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE ABOUT  THE SAME. OH, THEY'RE READY. LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT. HMM.
KILL ME! PLEASE, KILL ME!
Jon: I'M SO SORRY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
