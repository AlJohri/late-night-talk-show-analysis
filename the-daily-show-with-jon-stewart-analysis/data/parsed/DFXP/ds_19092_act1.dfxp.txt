FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. [ CHEERING ]
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. I'M JON STEWART. NICE. TONIGHT WE GOT OUR SELVES A HUMDINGER ON THE PROGRAM. A SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, ELIZABETH WARREN, IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT RIGHT AWAY WITH BREAKING NEWS FROM THE INSIDE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
MARK AND I VERY EXCITED THAT WE HAVE OUR FIRST CHILD ARRIVING LATER THIS YEAR.
OH MY GOD, THEY'VE GOT A CHILD ARRIVING, HOW DID THEY PULL THAT OFF? REALLY, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS? I MEAN, IF THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS, I SHOULD HAVE SIX KIDS! OH REALLY, NOT EVERY TIME? OH, OKAY. [ Laughter ]
HERE'S THE ODD THING ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT: DARRELL ISSA HAS ALREADY SUBPOENAED THE BABY TO TESTIFY ABOUT BENGHAZI. TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW, BABY. [ Laughter ]
BUT CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CLINTON FAMILY. NEWS MEDIA? SET THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL SPECULATRON TO BABY.
EVERYBODY IS WONDERING WHAT IMPACT IT MIGHT HAVE ON HILARY CLINTON'S DECISION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016 DOES THE FACT THAT SHE'S GOING TO BECOME A GRANDMOTHER ON TOP OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FACTOR IN?
COULD IT PUT A BUMP IN HILLARY'S 2016 PLANS? AND IS IT SEXIST TO ASK?
NO SILLY BILLY, OF COURSE IT'S NOT SEXIST. EVEN THOUGH IT IS A QUESTION THAT HAS NEVER EVER BEEN POSED TO A MALE CANDIDATE EVER. FOR GOD SAKES, MITT ROMNEY HAS LIKE A LITTER OF GRANDCHILDREN. MITT ROMNEY HAS FOR GOD SAKES, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, MITT ROMNEY HAS LIKE A GRANDCHILD PETTING ZOO! [ Laughter ]
THE GUY ADDED THREE GRANDCHILDREN WHILE HE WAS CAMPAIGNING! HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN HISTORY WHOSE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TOTAL IS LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF CHAIRS HE HAS TO PUT OUT AT THANKSGIVING. MY POINT IS HE GOT CRUSHED IN THE ELECTION BY SOMEONE WITH NO GRANDCHILDREN. YET SOMEHOW THE GRANDCHILDREN FACTOR NEVER CAME UP IN THE RACE BETWEEN OBAMA AND ROMNEY. FOR GOD'S SAKE, WHEN WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT WAS RUNNING IN 1908, HE WAS ACTUALLY PREGNANT. HE WAS PREGNANT. NO ONE SAID ANYTHING.  IT'S AS THOUGH MEN AND WOMEN ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. LIKE THEY'RE FROM TWO DIFFERENT PLANETS. LET'S CALL ONE OF THOSE PLANETS MARS, AND THE OTHER PLANET, LET'S CALL IT UH, BLIGORP 7. FOR INSTANCE, SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 22 YEAR SENATE VETERAN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF BLIGORP 7. FEINSTEIN CHAIRS THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WHICH RECENTLY COMPLETED A NEW REPORT ABOUT THE CIA'S BUSH ERA'S TORTURE PROGRAM. THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO RELEASE THEIR FINDINGS THAT THE CIA'S PROGRAMS WERE FAR MORE BRUTAL AND WIDESPREAD THAN HAD BEEN REPORTED THAT THE CIA HAD BRUTAL AND WIDESPREAD THAN HAD BEEN REPORTED THAT THE CIA HAD OVERSTATED TORTURE'S EFFECTIVENESS. OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
FORMER CIA DIRECTOR MICHAEL HAYDEN CHARACTERIZED SENATOR DIANE FEINSTEIN'S MOTIVATION FOR RELEASING THE REPORT AS EMOTIONAL. >>THAT MOTIVATION FOR THE REPORT, CHRIS, MAY SHOW DEEP EMOTIONAL FEELING ON THE PART OF THE SENATOR BUT I DON'T THINK IT LEADS YOU TO AN OBJECTIVE REPORT.
Jon: SENATOR JUST NEEDS HER BEAUTY SLEEP. THAT'S ALL SHE NEEDS. [ Laughter ]
SO THE WAY THE FORMER HEAD OF THE CIA IS DEFENDING THAT AGENCY'S USE OF TORTURE IS TO ARGUE THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE SENATOR'S REPORT IT UNRELIABLE BECAUSE IT WAS IMPARTED UNDER EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. WELL -- I TELL YOU, THAT GUY IS GOING TO BE SAD TOMORROW TO SEE THAT ZINGER IN HIS INBOX. YOU KNOW, IT IS A THEME WE SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW? WHEN ALLIES OF CHRIS CHRISTIE RELEASED A REPORT EXONERATING CHRISTIE IN THE BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL, HIS FORMER AIDE BRIDGET ANNE KELLY PROVOKED SIMILAR CONCERNS.
SHE SEEMED EMOTIONAL. SHE WAS HABITUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS PERCEIVED BY THE GOVERNOR. A BOYFRIEND HAD ENDED A RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S IN REFERENCE TO ONE OF THE CHRISTIE OFFICIALS SHE WAS WITH, THE REPORT COMMISSIONED BY MR. CHRISTIE AND RELEASED THURSDAY DOUBLES DOWN ON A STRATEGY OF PORTRAYING MS. KELLY AS DUPLICITOUS, WEEPING FREQUENTLY AND DEPENDENT ON MEN FOR APPROVAL AND STABILITY.
NO? BUT THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT KELLY, QUOTE, WOULD LOOK MUCH PRETTIER IF SHE SMILED. AND CONCLUDED THAT THE COMMISSION HATED TO SEE HER RESIGN BUT LOVED TO WATCH HER GO. OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONCERN FOR EMOTIONALITY, WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN IN POLITICS. LIKE WHEN HILLARY CLINTON COMING OFF AN UPSET LOSS IN IOWA LET HER GUARD DOWN AT A NEW HAMPSHIRE CAMPAIGN EVENT.
HILLARY CLINTON GETTING ALL MISTY EYES WHEN TALKING TO VOTERS EARLIER TODAY.
IT WAS AS CLOSE TO A BREAKDOWN AS I'VE EVER SEEN HILLARY HAVE. I MEAN, SHE IS JUST LETTING HER EMOTIONS FALL OUT OF HER.
CAN'T HELP IT.
CAN'T HELP IT. BEWILDERED, FRUSTRATED.
WE CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO BREAK DOWN AND START CRYING AT THE MOST DIFFICULT MOMENTS.
OF COURSE WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. AND THAT CANDIDATE PUDDLE THAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON ISN'T FIT TO SERVE WITH OUR STRONGER MORE STABLE MALE POLITICIANS. YOU KNOW HOW THE LADIES ARE WITH THE -- (LAUGHING).
WHEN I THINK OF WHAT KYLE HAS MEANT TO ME OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.
IT'S MY SON. GOD ALMIGHTY!
MAKING SURE THAT THESE KIDS HAVE A SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY GOD,  IT'S IMPORTANT. [ Laughter ]
STOP IT, STOP IT, THAT MAN IS NOT CRYING. HE'S A MALE. HE'S NOT CRYING. HE'S WEARING HIS FAVORITE ONION SHIRT. THAT'S AN ONION SHIRT. IT'S DIFFERENT. AND BESIDES, IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN CRYING, IT'S THE MOOD SWINGS. THE OTHER STUFF.
HILLARY SEEMS TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF ANGER.
WHY IS SHE SO DARN ANGRY?
YEAH, WHAT IS (BLEEP) WRONG WITH HER? CALM THE (bleep) DOWN LADY? CAUSE THAT'S THE THING, IF YOU WANT TO BE IN POLITICS, YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN HOW TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.
IF YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF LIKE THAT IN THE COURTROOM YOUR REAR END IS GOING TO GET THROWN IN JAIL, IDIOT. DID I SAY ON TOPIC? ARE YOU STUPID?
DAMN MAN I'M GOVERNOR, CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP FOR A SECOND?
THANK YOU, EXACTLY. THAT'S HOW YOU HANDLE GOVERNMENT BUSINESS. CALM, COOL, COLLECTED. BUT THE LADIES, ONE MINUTE, YAH YAH YAH YAH AND THEN THE NEXT MINUTE THEY'RE GIVING YOU THE SILENT TREATMENT.
MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE A PROCEDURAL QUESTION. MR. CHAIRMAN, I HAVE A PROCEDURE QUESTION. MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU CANNOT RUN A COMMITTEE LIKE THIS.
REPUBLICAN ACCUSATION  IN THIS INVESTIGATION --
WE'RE ADJOURNED. CLOSE IT DOWN. THANK YOU.
DON'T THANK US, THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US ALL HOW CONFLICT RESOLUTION IS HANDLED MATURELY BY MALES. NOT LIKE THOSE CAT FIGHTING BROADS. MEOW.
I CALL IT GARBAGE, DR. RICE. IT COMES FROM THE MOUTH.
IT'S DR. BRINKLEY. RICE IS A UNIVERSTIY.
NO, YOU JUST BE QUIET. YOU BE QUIET.
YOU DON'T OWN ME. I PAY YOUR SALARY.
Jon: OKAY, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! [APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW,
THE BEST PART OF THE ENTIRE BIT IS THE WOMAN SITTING BEHIND REPRESENTATIVE YOUNG WHO SITS UP IN STUNNED DISBELIEVING ADMIRATION. THAT IS JUST PURE ADMIRATION. AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF MALE DISCOURSE IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. I'M SURPRISED SHE WAS ABLE TO KEEP QUIET. AS EXCITABLE AS THE LADIES GET SOMETIMES. (LAUGHING).
YOU KNOW THE LADIES WITH THE SCREAMING. AT LEAST THAT LADY HAD TIME TO PUT HERSELF TOGETHER, PUT HER FACE ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW VAIN THE LADIES CAN BE, YOU KNOW HOW THE LADIES ARE ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. NOW RIGHT ABOUT NOW, YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF, BUT JON IN YOUR ZEAL TO MAKE A CASE THAT WOMEN ARE TOO EMOTIONAL AND UNPREDICTABLE TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE, YOU SEEM ALMOST MADE AN OPPOSITE CASE. SHOWCASING, HIGHLIGHTING, INSTANCES WHERE RESPECTED MALES OFFICIALS APPEAR TO BE NOT IN TOTAL CONTROL OF THEIR EMOTIONAL, LET'S CALL IT SELVES -- MY FRIEND I SEE THE CRITICAL MISTAKE YOU HAVE MADE IN YOUR THINKING. FOR ALL THOSE EXAMPLES OF MALE EMOTION ARE IN FACT NOT NEGATIVE BUT POSITIVE.
TAKES A LOT MORE COURAGE FOR A POLITICIAN TO CRY ON TELEVISION. THAN IT DOES TO BE TOUGH.
LOOK AT THE PASSION BEHIND THIS GUY.
CONGRESSMAN WE LOVE IT WHEN YOU GET FIBERY LIKE THAT.
STRAIGHT SHOOTER. HE'S TOUGH. HE'LL TAKE ON HECKLERS.
YOU SEE AN HONEST OPEN GOVERNOR THAT DOES SHOW EMOTION.
HE WAS FORCEFUL. HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE.
HE WAS AGGRESSIVE,  HE WAS PRESIDENTIAL.
THAT'S A MAN'S MAN. WHO GETS CHOKED UP ABOUT ABOUT HIS COUNTRY AND ABOUT THE THINGS HE FEELS PASSIONATE ABOUT. ALL OF A SUDDEN FEELING PASSION FOR AMERICA AND THE HOPES FOR HIS FELLOW AMERICANS IS SOMETHING EVIL?
SO THAT'S REALLY THE LESSON WE HAVE LEARNED TODAY. IN POLITICS IT'S OKAY TO BE A PUSSY AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A DICK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
