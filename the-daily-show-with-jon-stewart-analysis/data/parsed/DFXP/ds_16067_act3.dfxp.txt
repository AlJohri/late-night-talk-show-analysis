[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT THE PROFESSIONOR OF HISTORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. HIS BOOK "PLAIN, HONEST MEN:  THE MAKING OF AMERICAN CONSTITUTION IS OUT IN PAPERBACK. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM RICHARD BEMAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- RICHARD BEEMAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AGAIN. WE'RE DELIGHTED. LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY YOU ARE HERE. YOU ARE AN ACCREDITED HISTORIAN, A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR. AM I CORRECT, SIR, IN SAYING THAT?
I HOPE SO.
Jon: YES. YOU'VE WRITTEN HOW MANY BOOKS, SEVEN?
SEVEN, YES.
Jon: SEVEN BOOKS. I HAD THIS FELLOW ON THE PROGRAM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. HIS NAME IS DAVID BARTON. HE CALLS HIMSELF A CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORIAN. HE HASmy AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE. I THOUGHT, GEEZ, I'M NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR AND HE TALKS REAL FUNNY. WHY NOT BRING ON A GUY WHO ALSO TALKS FAST BUT InCONSTITUTION TO EXPLAIN  HEAD FELT LIKE THE LIBERTY BELL AFTER THIS GUY LEFT. GIVE ME THE STATES RIGHTS SOUND BITE.
THE CONSTITUTION LIMITS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT THE  STATES THAT'S THE NINTH AND TENTH AMENDMENT. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF FOUNDING FATHERS RELIGION WAS TO BE DEALT WITH IN STATES. IT'S THE POWERS DOCTRINE. IF IT'S NOT THERE THE CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE PERMISSION TO DO IT. THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ONLY TO LIMIT THE FEDERAL CONGRESS, NOT THE STATES.
Jon: WHAT HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING IS IF THE STATES DO NOT WISH TO ABIDE BY THE BILL OF  RIGHTS, THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
THERE WAS A LOT GOING IN THIS THAT STATEMENT INCLUDING A GREAT  DENIGRATION REALLY OF THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS. BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT BETWEEN 1791 AND WHEN THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ADROPDROP THE --  ADOPTED AND 1868 THE STATES WERE NOT OWE BLIJED -- OBLIGED TO ABIDE BY THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS. THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS RELATED TO THOSE THINGS THAT CONGRESS COULD NOT DO TO ABRIDGE  FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
Jon: HE IS NOT A CRAZY PERSON.
HE IS NOT. HE'S RIGHT.
Jon: HE'S RIGHT!
ON THAT NARROW SUBJECT. ON THE POINT OF RELIGION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE NOTE THAT THE STATES N FACT, FOR NEARLY ALL OF  THAT PERIOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THREE, CONNECTICUT UP TO 1818, NEW HAMPSHIRE UP TO 1819, MASSACHUSETTS UP TO 1833, THOSE STATES ALSO ENACTED LAWS -- ALL OF THE OTHER STATES AND FINALLY  NEW HAMPSHIRE, CONNECTICUT AND MASSACHUSETTS EMBRACES THE IDEA NOT ONLY OF FREE EXERCISE OF  RELIGION BUT SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.
Jon: RIGHT SO.
THEY ULTIMATELY CAME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BILL OF RIGHTS. BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT AND REVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT CAME THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY  LATER WHEN THE STATES AND THE CONGRESS ADOPTED THE 14th AMENDMENT. JON, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FORGIVE ME I'M A SAP MANTICS CONSTITUTIONAL -- SEMANTICS  CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR HERE. I WANT TO GET THE RIGHT WORDS.
Jon: PLEASE.
THIS IS MY TRUSTY CONSTITUTION -- POCKET CONSTITUTION FROM THE NATIONAL  CONSTITUTION CENTER.
Jon: FOR MADISON THAT WAS FULL SIZE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. TINY LITTLE i.
Jon: I BET THAT KILLED AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS. GO AHEAD.
NO STATE SHALL MAKE OR ENFORCE ANY LAW WHICH SHALL ABRIDGE THE PRIVILEGES OR  IMMUNITIES OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES NOR SHOULD ANY STATE DEPRIVE ANY PERSON OF  LIFE, LIBERTY OR PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW NOR DENY TO ANY PERSON WITHIN ITS  JURISDICTION THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS. WHAT THAT 14th AMENDMENT HAS COME TO MEAN AND THIS HAS BEEN EMBRACES BY VIRTUALLY EVERY  CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR IN THE COUNTRY AND EVERY JUDGE IN THE COUNTRY INCLUDING, ON MOST OH,S, JUSTICE ANTONIC SCALIA -- ANTONIN SCALIA, WERE BOUND TO ABIDE BY THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS.u! ALTHOUGH IT INITIALLY APPLIED TO ONLY ACTIONS OF CONGRESS IN OUR 21ST CENTURY WORLD IT TRULY DOES  APPLY PARTICULAR ANY IN THE AREA OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO STATES AS WELL.
Jon: I ASSUME HIS ARGUMENT?%?R WOULD BE THAT IS WRONGLY DECIDED AND THAT IS NOT THE  INTERPRETATION OF THE 14th AMENDMENT THAT THE FOUNDERS WOULD HAVE WANTED OTHERWISE THEY  WOULD HAVE PLACED IT IN THERE. WHY DIDN'T THE FOUNDERS PUT IN THE TENTH AMENDMENT THAT NOT JUST AT CONGRESS SHALL NOT  ABRIDGE THESE LAWS BUT THAT THE STATES SHALL NOT?
IN FACT, JAMES MADISON WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DRAFTING THE  FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS WANTED AN ARTICLE PROHIBITING THE STATES FROM INFRINGING FREEDOM OF  RELIGION AND ESTABLISHING RELIGION BUT HE WAS DEFEATED. HE WAS DEFEATED BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT AND NEW HAMPSHIRE DIDN'T WANT THAT  TO HAPPEN. BUT, IN FACT, THE TIDE OF HISTORY WAS MOVING WITH MADISON. THOSE STATES DID ULTIMATELY DO THAT ON THEIR OWN.
Jon: IN SOME RESPECTS THERE'S A GOOD KERNEL OF HISTORY HERE THAT IS HOLDING ON IT TO. IT'S NOT COMPLETELY AL CAMI BUT IT'S IGNORING THE 200 YEARS AFTER IT. SORT OF LIKE MAKING THE ARGUMENT WE HAD SHR SLAVES. IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION WE HAD SLAVES SO THE FOUNDERS WOULD BE OKAY.
PRECISELY. LISTEN, AS I HOPE PEOPLE WHO READ MY BOOK WILL APPRECIATE.
Jon: NICELY DONE. NICELY DONE. DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES. HERE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. YOU SHOULD GET THE BOOKS BECAUSE THEY ARE GREAT AND WELL WRITTEN AND EVERYTHING. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL. WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK. WE'LL PUT UP ON THE WEB THE REST OF MY CONVERSATION WITH THIS  FINE HISTORIAN, "PLAN, HONEST
