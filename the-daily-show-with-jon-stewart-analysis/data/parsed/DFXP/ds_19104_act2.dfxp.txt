(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK. LAST NIGHT, WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE COMMENTS L.A. CLIPPERS' OWNER-TURNED-RACIST-OUTCAST DONALD STERLING MADE ABOUT MAGIC JOHNSON TO ANDERSON COOPER. IT TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST NIGHT ONE OF THE MINI SERIES OF KNUCKLEHEADEDNESS THAT IS ANDERSON COOPER'S DONALD STERLING INTERVIEW. LET'S LOOK AT NIGHT TWO IN OUR NEW SEGMENT, OKAY, YOU GO BYE NOW. (LAUGHTER) WHEN WE LAST LEFT HIM, DONALD STERLING WAS BLAMING HIS GIRLFRIEND AND MAGIC JOHNSON FOR SOMEHOW MAKING HIM SPOUT RACIST NONSENSE! POP IT.
MAGIC JOHNSON, YOU KNOW, HAS MADE A PUBLIC COMMENT. DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM?
HERE'S A MAN WHO -- I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD SAY THIS -- HE ACTS SO HOLY. I MEAN, HE MADE LOVE TO EVERY GIRL IN EVERY CITY IN AMERICA AND HE HAD AIDS, AND WHEN HE HAD THOSE AIDS, I WENT TO MY SYNAGOGUE AND I PRAYED FOR HIM. (LAUGHTER)
I PRAYED -- I PRAYED FOR HIS BAG OF AIDS! OH, I WANTED HIM TO NOT HAVE THE WHOLE AIDS... NOW TECHNICALLY, MAGIC JOHNSON HAS "THOSE HIV" AND NOT "THOSE AIDS". JESUS CHRIST, AM I SERIOUSLY FACT-CHECKING AN 80 YEAR-OLD BILLIONAIRE LUNATIC? MAYBE I'LL JUST LEAVE THAT UP TO THE FOLKS AT INSANI-FACT. YEAH. NOW, DONALD STERLING HAD GONE ON ANDERSON COOPER'S SHOW OSTENSIBLY TO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING RACIST. AND THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF THIS MAN DONALD STERLING. HE CLOSES HIS APOLOGY WITH REALLY TEXTBOOK, CATEGORICAL, OLD-FASHIONED RACISM.
I SPENT MILLIONS ON GIVING AWAY AND HELPING MINORITIES. DOES HE DO THAT? THAT'S ONE PROBLEM I HAVE. JEWS, WHEN THEY GET SUCCESSFUL, THEY WILL HELP THEIR PEOPLE, AND SOME OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS -- MAYBE I'LL GET IN TROUBLE AGAIN -- THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP ANYBODY.
MAYBE? MAYBE YOU WILL GET IN TROUBLE AGAIN? JEWS -- HELP -- BLACKS. (LAUGHTER) UNLESS, MAYBE WHAT HE'S DOING HERE IS WORKSHOPPING MATERIAL FOR HIS NEW H.B.O. SPECIAL DONALD STERLING'S LITERALLY DEAF COMEDY JAM. THE JEWS GIVE THE CHARITIES, BUT THE BLACKS GIVE TO CHARITIES... SORRY, I'M JUST, CAN I JUST SAY THIS? I SPENT A LOT OF THANKSGIVINGS WITH FOLKS LIKE THIS, SO -- ALL RIGHT, STERLING, YOU GO BYE, NOW. YOU GO BYE. WAIT, ALL RIGHT SO,   WHO WILL TAKE STERLING'S PLACE IN THE UNFORCED ERROR SPOTLIGHT?
AT A CONFERENCE IN LOS ANGELES LAST WEEK KARL ROVE SUGGESTED HILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE. HE CITED THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE'S HEALTH SCARE BACK IN 2012 WHEN SHE FELL AND SUFFERED BLOOD CLOT. HERE'S A QUOTE, "30 DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND WHEN SHE REAPPEARS SHE'S WEARING GLASSES THAT ARE ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY?  WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH THAT."
YES. YES, WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? KIND OF PETERED OUT AT THE END THERE, FOR ROVE, DIDN'T HE? IS HILLARY CLINTON TOO MENTALLY SCRAMBLED TO RUN THE COUNTRY? I MEAN, WHAT THE DEAL-IO? ONE PROBLEM, THOUGH, WITH AMBASSADOR ROVE'S STATEMENT, SECRETARY CLINTON WAS ACTUALLY IN THE HOSPITAL FOR FOUR DAYS, NOT 30. APPARENTLY, KARL ROVE UNSKEWED THAT NUMBER. CLEARLY, HE THOUGHT CRANIUM GATE WAS GOING TO BE A SLAM-DUNK TALKING POINT. TURNS OUT NOT REALLY.
HOW DID THIS COMMENT COME UP SUGGESTING THAT HILLARY CLINTON MAY SUFFER FROM BRAIN DAMAGE? WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE. NO, NO, I DIDN'T SAY SHE HAD BRAIN DAMAGE --
I NEVER SAID BRAIN DAMAGE! I MERELY NOTED, IN PASSING, THAT SHE WAS WEARING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY EYEWEAR -- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE -- LOBOTO-LENSES! WHATEVER. THE BOOP BOOP GLASSES. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM! REALLY KARL, YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO CONSPIRACY ROUTE ON THIS ONE?
SHE HAD APPARENTLY A SERIOUS VIRUS. THEY ANNOUNCED THEN ON THE 15TH OF DECEMBER THAT SHE HAD AT SOME PERIOD IN THE PAST WEEK FALLEN. THEY DIDN'T SAY WHEN, THEY DIDN'T SAY WHERE. SHE WAS RECOVERING AT HOME. ON THE 30th OF DECEMBER, SHE GOES IN AND TURNS OUT TO HAVE HAD A BLOOD CLOT. THEY WON'T SAY WHERE.
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS! AN ATTEMPTED COVERUP! MY GOD, IT'S BRAINGHAZI! (LAUGHTER) HOW MANY, HOW MANY SYNAPSES? WE NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH! (LAUGHTER) BRAINGHAZI! JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION BEFORE YOU GO THERE, HOUSE M.D. WHEN DID YOU START CARING SO MUCH ABOUT THE FITNESS OF THOSE WHO HAVE TO HOLD THE OVAL OFFICE? (APPLAUSE) PERHAPS, I ASSUME IT WAS RIGHT AFTER YOUR BOSS FELL AND BANGED HIS HEAD AFTER LOSING A BATTLE WITH A PRETZEL. (LAUGHTER) DUDE BLACKS OUT, NEXT THING YOU KNOW HE'S STARTING AN UNPROVOKED WAR IN IRAQ. NOW HE SPENDS HIS DAYS EATIN' APPLESAUCE AND PAINTING HIS FEET! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
