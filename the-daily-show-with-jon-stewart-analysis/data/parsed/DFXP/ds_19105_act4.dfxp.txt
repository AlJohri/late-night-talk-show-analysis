Jon: HELLO EVERYBODY. WE'RE BACK. SO, THIS IS VERY EXCITING. WE'RE TALKING TO DEBBIE HARRY, CHRIS STEIN OF BLONDIE. 40 YEARS. IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS, 40, RIGHT? RIGHT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
YEP.
Jon: HAS THE PROCESS CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE WAY YOU WRITE, THE WAY YOU COLLABORATE? HAS THAT CHANGED OVER TIME OR DOES IT WHEN YOU GET BACK TOGETHER IT FEELS LIKE MAGIC?
