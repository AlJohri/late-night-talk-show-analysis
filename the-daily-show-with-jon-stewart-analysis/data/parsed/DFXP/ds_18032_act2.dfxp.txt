Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK! I HOPE YOU KNOW THE 2012  ELECTION WAS IN LARGE PART A  FIGHT OVER DEMOGRAPHICS. THE REPUBLICANS TAKING PAINS  EVEN IF AT THEIR CONVENTION TO  HIGHLIGHT THE GENDER AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY THEIR PARTY HAS  TRADITIONALLY DONE SO WELL  DISGUISING. (LAUGHTER)  AND YET THEY LOST. FOR SOME REASON--  SELF-DEPORTATION-- PRESIDENT  OBAMA WON A CLEAR MAJORITY. -- THE COUNTRY HALF MOOCHERS--  (LAUGHTER)  OF OVER NON-WHITE GROUP. EVEN AMONGST WOMEN. VAGINAS REPEL RAPE SPERM. (LAUGHTER)  ROMNEY SOMEHOW LOST BY 11  POINTS. IT'S A FACT REPUBLICANS CAN'T  IGNORE IF THEY WANT TO WIN BACK  THE WHITE HOUSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EVER. (LAUGHTER)  NO BAND-AID SOLUTIONS. G.O.P. CAN'T JUST THROW IN A  FREE PEDICURE EVERY MANDATORY  ULTRASOUND AND CALL IT A DAY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING A  REAL PLACE FOR MINORITIES AND  WOMEN IN A MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY AND I THINK THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY GETS THAT. I ASSUME.
IN WASHINGTON TONIGHT, THE  G.O.P. IS DEALING WITH THE ISSUE  OF OPTICS AND DIVERSITY IN POLITICS, GETTING A LOT OF  COVERAGE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL  COMMITTEE CHAIRS SELECTED THUS FAR FOR THE NEXT CONGRESS. THEY ARE ALL WHITE MALES. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: OH, I GUESS THEY ALL  LOOK ALIKE TO YOU, WILLIAMS. (LAUGHTER)  I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, THERE IS A  GREAT DEAL OF DIVERSITY AND  VARIETY IN THAT GROUP. FOR INSTANCE, WITH THESE THREE  GENTLEMEN ALONE LOOK LIKE THE  KIND OF GUYS WHO WOULD SELL YOU THREE VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF  INSURANCE. (LAUGHTER)  AND LOOK AT THIS GUY! PAUL RYAN! THAT GUY'S GOD A WIDOW'S PEAK. THAT'S WEIRD. THAT'S DIFFERENT. AND THAT GUY, SURE, HE LOOKS  LIKE YOUR AVERAGE LOCAL NEWS  ANCHOR. BUT THAT OTHER GUY NEAR HIM  LOOKS LIKE YOUR AVERAGE SPORTS  ANNOUNCER. (LAUGHTER)  SO THE BLAND WHITE GUY WITH  GLASSES, THAT GUY'S NEARSIGHTED  BUT THIS OTHER GUY WITH GLASSES, THAT GUY'S GOT ASTIGMATISM. THERE'S NO -- WHAT'S THAT? REALLY, NEAR SIGHTED AS WELL? (BLEEP). ALL RIGHT. WELL AT LEAST WITH THAT MANY  DUDES IN THE GROUP STATISTICALLY  SPEAKING AT LEAST ONE OF THEM'S GOT TO BE GAY. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  WHERE IS WALDO? (LAUGHTER)  BUT INSTEAD, INSTEAD ALL THE  MEDIA'S ALL HYPERFOCUSED  "THERE'S NO LATINOS OR BLACKS OR WOMEN OR ASIANS."  THERE'S GOT TO BE A GOOD REASON.
THE LEADERSHIP POINTS OUT  THEY WERE SELECTED FOR A REASON,  INCLUDING SENIORITY.
THERE'S ABOUT 20 WOMEN IN THE  REPUBLICAN HOUSE CAUCUS AND NINE  OF THEM WERE ELECTED IN 2010 AND  2012.
Jon: SO IT'S SENIORITY? LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. THE PARTY THAT HATES THE  TEACHERS UNIONS GIVES  CHAIRMANSHIPS BASED ON TENURE? (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, IT'S A REPUBLICAN HOUSE. NO MEDIA MOB OF P.C. DIVERSITY  COPS IS GOING TELL HOW SPEAKER  JOHN BANER WHAT TO DO.
CONGRESSWOMAN CAN DAYS MILLER  OF MICHIGAN WILL CHAIR THE HOUSE  ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE.
Jon: WE GOT ONE! WHOO! A LADY WITH LADY PARTS! SHE WILL BE THE CHAIR OF THE  HOUSE ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE  WHOSE RESPONSIBILITIES APPARENTLY RANGE FROM MAKING  CONGRESS MORE OPEN AND  ACCESSIBLE TO ENSURING THE HOUSE RUNS EFFICIENTLY AND SMOOTHLY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  (LAUGHTER)  SO WE'VE GOT A WOMAN TO BE-- TO  COIN A PHRASE-- THE HOUSEWIFE. (LAUGHTER)  PROBLEM SOLVED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
