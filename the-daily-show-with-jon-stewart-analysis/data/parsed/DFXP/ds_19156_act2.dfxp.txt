>>THE WHITE HOUSE! THE WHITE HOUSE IS HOME TO THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. AND AS SUCH, THE ULTIMATE IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS OF SECURITY -- OR NOT.
A FRIGHTENING SECURITY BREACH AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 42-YEAR-OLD OMAR GONZALEZ OF TEXAS JUMPED THE FENCE LAST NIGHT AT 7:20 P.M. HE MADE IT ALL THE WAY UP THE NORTH LAWN. HE WASN'T STOPPED UNTL HE PASSED THROUGH THE THRESHOLD OF THE WHITE HOUSE DOORS.
WOW. WELL IT'S A GOOD THING WE DON'T TREAT WHITE HOUSE INTRUDERS THE WAY WE TREAT CUBAN REFUGEES. BECAUSE THEN, ONCE THAT GUY REACHED THE HOUSE, PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GROUND, HE WOULD THEN AUTOMATICALLY BECOME PRESIDENT. THIS GUY MUST BE SOME KIND OF GENIUS CAT BURGLAR NINJA TO GET THROUGH THE HOUSE'S MANY LAYERS OF DEFENSES.
GONZALES ENTERED THE UNLOCKED FRONT DOOR OF THE FIRST FAMILY'S RESIDENCE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OR HE COULD BE FAST. THEY LEAVE THE DOOR OF THE MOST SECURE HOME IN THE COUNTRY -- UNLOCKED. I GUESS PRESIDENT OBAMA THOUGHT IT WAS TOO DORKY TO CARRY THE KEY AROUND. IS THAT THE PROBLEM? (LAUGHTER) WHAT WAS THE SECRET SERVICE DOING?
THE INCIDENT HAPPENED JUST FOUR MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST FAMILY HAD LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS FOR THE WEEKEND. FORMER SECRET SERVICE SPECIAL AGENT SAYS IT'S POSSIBLE THE BREECH HAPPENED BECAUSE RESOURCES WERE FOCUSED ON THE PRESIDENT'S DEPARTURE.
Jon: WELL THAT MAKES SENSE. IF THEY ALL STAY AT THEIR POSTS, WHO'S GOING TO WAVE GOODBYE TO THE PRESIDENT AS HE FLIES OFF IN HIS HELICOPTER? AND WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT LOOKED BACK AND NOBODY WAS WAVING? WELL, HE WOULD BE HEART BROKEN! (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE, WE TURN TO WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF JASON JONES LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
JON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: JASON, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
JON, I AM HERE --
Jon: JASON, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO INTERRUPT. IS THAT THE PRESIDENT'S CLOSET? HOW DID YOU GET INTO THEIR PRIVATE RESIDENCE?
I WALKED IN. JON, WHEN POTUS ISN'T HERE THERE'S LIKE ZERO SECURITY IN THIS PLACE.
Jon: BUT HE'S BACK NOW. HE HAD MEETINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY.
THAT'S WHY I'M HIDING! I CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER PRESIDENT CATCH ME IN THEIR BEDROOM OKAY? AHHH! BETSY TRUMAN! OURS WAS A LOVE FORBIDDEN BY SOCIETY -- AND A LOSS OF TIME AND SPACE.
Jon: JASON, I APPRECIATE THE ACCESS, BUT COME ON OUT. THERE'S NO WAY TO REPORT ON THESE SECURITY BREACHES FROM BEHIND THE CLOSET. COME ON OUT AND TALK TO US.
FINE! FINE!
Jon: AND GIVE US THE SCOOP ON EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER) REALLY? (LAUGHTER) REALLY? ONE OF MICHELLE'S DRESSES. JASON.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE IN THERE IN HIS CLOSET. WHY NOT TAKE ONE OF HIS SUITS?
BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN OBAMA'S CLOSET BUT BOMBER JACKETS AND MOM JEANS, JON. BESIDES, YOU KNOW, MICHELLE'S JUST GOING TO DONATE THIS TO THE SMITHSONIAN. A DRESS LIKE THIS IS A THOROUGHBRED, OKAY -- YOU GOT TO LET IT OUT TO RUN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'M AFRAID TO ASK THIS, JASON, BUT WHERE ARE YOUR ACTUAL CLOTHES?
OH, NO IDEA, JON, OKAY? THESE NO POTUS PARTIES THE SECRET SERVICE THROWS ARE CRAZY!
Jon: NOW THAT THEY'RE BACK ON LOCKDOWN AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HOW ARE YOU PLANNING ON GETTING OUT IN THAT, YES, I AGREE, BEAUTIFUL GOWN?
THANK YOU. I'M NOT. KAY? I'M JUST GOING TO LAY LOW TILL I HEAR THE ALL-CLEAR SIGN. (LOUD MUSIC) OH [BLEEP]!  LOOKS LIKE POTUS JUST WENT TO THE CLIMATE SUMMIT. LET'S GET THIS WHITE HOUSE PARTY STARTED! THE ROOF, THE ROOF, THE ROOF CONTAINS SNIPERS.
Jon: THANK YOU, JASON. JASON JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
