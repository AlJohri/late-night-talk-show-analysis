FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! I'M JON STEWART! WE HAVE A FINE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU THIS EVENING WITH LOVE. WITH LOVE THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN PREPARED! FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WILL BE JOINING US THIS EVENING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GLOBAL INITIATIVE. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIS GLOBAL INITIATIVE. IT IS THAT ORGANIZATION'S TENTH ANNIVERSARY. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT FIRST, FORMER SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON -- NO RELATION -- (LAUGHTER) -- WORD ON THE STREET IS THAT THE FORMER SENATOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE IS THINKING OF DIVING BACK INTO POLITICS, PRESIDENT FIRST. (CHEERING) BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE SHE WOULD WIN THE NOMINATION EVEN FROM HER PARTY. IT'S MOSTLY GUARANTEED, BUT IT IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S IT'S MOSTLY GUARANTEED, BUT IT IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2016: IN YOUR DREAMS, JOE BIDEN. LISTEN, WE ALL LOVE JOE BIDEN. JUST LAST WEEK I BOUGHT A INSURANCE POLICY FROM HIM. (LAUGHTER) BUT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE WILL NOT BE PRESIDENT. NOT THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE RESUME. FOR INSTANCE, AS SENATOR HE SPONSORED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND STILL SPEAKS PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE ISSUE.
IT'S NEVER, NEVER, NEVER THE WOMAN'S FAULT. THIS WHOLE CULTURE, FOR SO LONG, HAS PUT THE ONUS ON THE WOMAN. WHAT WERE YOU WEARING? WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT DID YOU DO TO PROVOKE? THAT IS NEVER THE APPROPRIATE QUESTION.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU NEVER HEAR THAT ENOUGH. YOU CAN NEVER HEAR THAT ENOUGH. AND THAT NEVER IS THE APPROPRIATE QUESTION. SPEAKING OF "NEVER APPROPRIATE " -- (LAUGHTER) IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER, AS JOE BIDEN GIVETH, JOE BIDEN TAKETH AWAY.
MY SON IS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE YEAR IN IRAQ, PEOPLE WOULD COME TO HIM AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT HOME IN TERMS OF FORECLOSURES, IN TERMS OF BAD LOANS THAT WERE BEING -- I MEAN, THESE SHYLOCKS WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THESE WOMEN AND MEN WHILE OVERSEAS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW IT -- (LAUGHTER) -- THE SHYLOCKS ARE NOT AN OLD-SCHOOL R&B GROUP FROM THE SEVENTIES -- (LAUGHTER) BUT, IN FACT, ARE A REFERENCE TO THE STEREOTYPICALLY GROTESQUELY GREEDY JEWISH MONEY LENDER, IN "MERCHANT OF VENICE," WHICH REMINDS ME (BLEEP) YOU SHAKESPEARE! (BLEEP) YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) I'VE BEEN WAITING 400 YEARS TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST. (LAUGHTER) ANYWHO, PULLING OUT A 17th CENTURY GREEDY JEWISH STEREOTYPE IS A PRETTY DEEP CUT. NOBODY REALLY USES THAT WORD ANYMORE. THEY RETIRED IT TO THE RACIST HALL OF FAME RIGHT BETWEEN AL JOLSON'S TIN OF SHOE POLISH AND A SIGN READING PLACE REDSKINS JERSEY HERE. BUT ALL RIGHT, BIDEN HAD A SLIP OF THE TONGUE. HE APOLOGIZED. A SINGLE ISOLATED INSTANCE OF USING OUTDATED RACIST TERMINOLOGY HARDLY DISQUALIFIES HIM FROM -- ROLL THE TAPE.
I STOPPED IN SINGAPORE TO MEET WITH A GUY NAMED LEE KUAN YEW WHOM MOST FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS AROUND THE WORLD SAY IS THE WISEST MAN IN THE ORIENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JOE, UNLESS THAT'S WHAT THE GUY PUTS ON HIS BUSINESS CARDS, I WOULD JUST GO WITH ASIA. I MEAN, ORIENT? SHYLOCK? IT'S LIKE BIDEN HASN'T BEEN OUT OF THE HOUSE SINCE 1962! (LAUGHTER) HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT SPEEDY GONZALEZ CHARACTER, ANYWAY, HUH? I MEAN, THAT WAS ONE FAST MEXICAN MOUSE, AM I RIGHT? MICKEY ROONEY, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, WHERE'S HIS OSCAR? C'MON! WHO'S UP FOR LUNCH AT SAMBO'S IT'S ON ME! I'M NO SCOTSMAN! FOR MORE ON JOE BIDEN'S RECENT BLUNDERS, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR CASUAL RACISM CORRESPONDENT, MICHAEL CHE. MICHAEL, THANKS FOR JOINING US. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I GOTTA TELL YA, HILLARY CLINTON HAS TO BE OVERJOYED TO SEE A CHALLENGER FLAME OUT LIKE THIS.
ARE YOU KIDDING, JON? THIS IS THE FIRST REAL THREAT TO HER CAMPAIGN. I MEAN, SURE, IT'S NICE TO HAVE JEWS AND ASIANS ON BOARD BUT IF JOE BIDEN CAN SOW UP THAT OLD WHITE RACIST VOTE, HE'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE! YOU GOT A LINE, MAN.  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY THINK THIS WAS A BIT WE WERE DOING, JOE BIDEN THING? YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS A BIT? A SEGMENT.
UH WHAT?
Jon: ALL RIGHT. FOR THOSE -- A LOT OF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS. TODAY IS MICHAEL CHE'S LAST DAY ON THE "THE DAILY SHOW." (AUDIENCE REACTS) I KNOW. BUT HE'S GOING TO BE CO-ANCHORING WEEKEND UPDATE ON S.N.L. IT'S TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WE'RE VERY EXCITED FOR MICHAEL. SO WE SORT OF CONCOCTED THIS WHOLE BIT, WE CONCOCTED THIS WHOLE BIT SO HE WOULDN'T KNOW WE WERE PLANNING A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR HIM. TONIGHT MARKS KIND OF THE AN END OF AN ERA AND WE GET TO SAY FAREWELL. YOU KNOW, AND IT REMIND ME WHEN JOHN OLIVER LEFT IN THE SAME WAY, AND IT WAS, I GUESS IT WAS...
HE WAS HERE FOR SEVEN YEARS. I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR, LIKE, THREE MONTHS.
Jon: YOU WERE HERE FOR, ACTUALLY, 58 BUSINESS DAYS. YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, I WILL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME YOUNG MICHAEL CHE SHOWED UP HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW," FRESH-FACED KID, MUST HAVE BEEN, WHAT, 31?
YEAH, MAN, I'M STILL 31. IT'S, LIKE, IT WAS JUNE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW, MICHAEL, BEFORE YOU GO -- AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE IF SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES CAME OUT AND GAVE TRIBUTE, IF THEY COULD. SO THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND GIVE TRIBUTE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NO, NO, NO, LET THEM HAVE THEIR MOMENT. LET THEM, LET THEM HAVE THEIR EMOTIONAL MOMENT!
IT WAS GREAT TO WORK WITH YOU EXACTLY THREE TIMES. (LAUGHTER)
YEAH. WHAT'S UP? I'M JESSICA. I HEARD SOME PRETTY GREAT THINGS.
DON'T BE A STRANGER, WYATT! (LAUGHTER)
SO YOU MUST BE SAM?
I AM. YES.
Jon: THAT'S SAM.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
THAT'S TERRIFIC.
NICE TO MEET YOU. THIS IS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
Jon: IT'S VERY MOVING. IT'S VERY MOVING. DRY THE EYES, DRY THE EYES A LITTLE BIT. DRY THE EYES. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS GOING TO BE IT, DID YA? I DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOU ABOUT THIS. THIS IS THE BIG SURPRISE. COME HERE. COME HERE YOU. COME HERE YOU. COME HERE.
WELL, OKAY.
Jon: COME HERE. SIT. SIT. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER AND, WELL, I'VE DONE THROUGH KIND OF A BIT OF A HIGHLIGHT REEL OF YOUR TIME HERE. IT'S MEANT SO MUCH TO US. SO, IF I MAY RIGHT NOW, IF I MAY SAY A FOND FAREWELL.  ♪ ♪ I WILL REMEMBER YOU...  ♪ ♪ I WILL REMEMBER YOU... ♪ WILL YOU REME --
Jon: OKAY, THAT'S ALL THE TAPE WE HAD SO WE DIDN'T -- (APPLAUSE)
WELL, I MEAN... UM... ALL RIGHT. WELL, THIS HAS BEEN COOL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YEAH.
IT'S A FUN SUMMER.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? LOOP THE FOOTAGE. LOOP THE FOOTAGE. GET EVERYBODY OVER HERE!
NO, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY, JON. YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
COME OVER HERE AND SAY GOODBYE. ARE YOU READY? EVERYBODY! ♪ I WILL REMEMBER YOU! MICHAEL CHE, EVERYBODY! WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU, MAN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
