(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM PERVEZ MUSHARRAF. SIR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (APPLAUSE) HAVE A SEAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AGAIN. WE APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU. NICE SEEING YOU.
Jon: THE LAST TIME WE... I PREPARED SOME REFRESHMENTS FOR US. I PREPARED TEA AND A TWINKIE. (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS OUR... WE HAVE TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH BECAUSE OF THE DETERIORATION OF OUR TWO  COUNTRY'S RELATIONSHIP. (LAUGHTER) POWER AID AND BALANCE BARS. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD THIS. YOU CAN HAVE A... WOULD YOU CARE FOR S'MORES?
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
Jon: (LAUGHS) YOU'RE OKAY WITH JUST THIS? I DON'T BLAME YOU, SIR. THAT'S PROBABLY WISE. TO YOUR HEALTH.
CHEERS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: A TASTE SENSATION. LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE, I ASKED YOU WHERE OSAMA BIN LADEN WAS. (LAUGHTER) LAUGH NOW, AT THE TIME I BELIEVE YOU HELD A RELATIVELY HIGH-LEVEL POSITION IN PAKISTAN. (LAUGHTER) YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW. FUNNY STORY. (LAUGHTER) AS IT TURNS OUT, HE WAS THERE! IN A TOWN CALLED ABBOTTABAD.
YES.
Jon: SO... (LAUGHTER) ... THAT WAS WEIRD. (LAUGHTER) DON'T YOU THINK, OR... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD... WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD THINK? WHAT DO YOU THINK... I KNOW THAT YOU WERE UPSET THAT WE CAME ON TO PAKISTANI SOVEREIGN TERRITORY  TO DO IT. WE WERE UPSET THAT HE WAS THERE. HOW DO WE BRIDGE THIS CONFLICT?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LET ME CLARIFY. I KNOW THAT IN YOUR PROGRAM YOU SAID I LIED TO YOU...
Jon: I MENTIONED THAT.
BUT THE SILVER LINING WAS THAT YOU SAID YOU LIED TO ME. SO WE'RE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.
Jon: WELL, TO BE FAIR, I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN LYING ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND  I LIED ABOUT READING YOUR BOOK. (LAUGHTER) SO WE'RE NOT SO ON A LEVEL FIELD, BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS. HOW IS IT... EXPLAIN TO US. IT'S HARD FOR US TO IMAGINE A HIGH-LEVEL INDIVIDUAL LIKE THAT TO BE ABLE TO ENSCONCE HIMSELF  IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. ABBOTTABAD IS NICE, GOLF COURSES, PEOPLE RETIRE THERE. IT'S YOUR PALM SPRINGS, TO SOME EXTENT. HOW DID IT... IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE AND NO ONE KNEW?
YES, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF YOU EVEN SEE WHERE HE WAS LIVING AND HE WAS NOT GUARDED, THE  INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES KNEW OR THE ARMY KNEW, WOULD HE... WOULD THEY LEAVE HIM THERE UNGUARDED  SO THAT HE ESCAPES AND WHEN C.I.A. COMES AND OCCUPIES A SAFE HOUSE CLOSE BY, WOULD... IF I  I.S.I. KNEW OR OUR INTELLIGENCE KNEW WOULD RELET HIM ESCAPE BECAUSE...
Jon: BUT ISN'T THAT WHY WE DIDN'T... THE U.S. DIDN'T TELL  PAKISTAN BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T... THE TRUST HAD BECOME SO BROKEN AT THAT POINT THEY THOUGHT IF THEY DID TELL THAT THE  POSSIBILITY EXISTED THAT HE WOULD GET AWAY.
I THINK IF I.S.I. KNEW AND THERE WAS COMPLICITY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT C.I.A. HAS  OCCUPIED A SAFE HOUSE VERY CLOSE AND IF THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALLOWED HEM TO ESCAPE. AS IT IS HE WAS SITTING THERE UNGUARDED. WHY WOULD THE ARMY OR INTELLIGENCE ALLOW HIM TO BE IN A HOUSE WHERE HE COULD ESCAPE, COME AND GO. SUCH AN IMPORTANT INDIVIDUAL. WHY WOULDN'T THEY USE HIM FOR THAT MATTER IF HE WAS THERE FOR  FIVE YEARS WHY WOULDN'T I USE HIM FOR SOME LEVERAGE FOR MYSELF.
Jon: OKAY. WELL, I GUESS I'LL ASK YOU THEN. (LAUGHS)  IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME... HE WAS LIVING IN A MILLION-DOLLAR HOUSE. THEY SAY IT WAS THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOR THAT BURNED THEIR OWN TRASH. IF A YOUNGSTER KICKED A SOCCER BALL OVER THE WALL THEY JUST PAID THE YOUNGSTER. PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ARE LIKE "WEIRD FOLKS LIVING THERE." (LAUGHTER)  DIDN'T IT RAISE THE... THIS IS... ABBOTTABAD IS THE TOWN THAT BASICALLY HOUSES PAKISTAN'S  VERSION OF WEST POINT. YOUR... THE GENERAL THAT YOU HAD TO HEAD UP THE I.S.I. UNDER YOUR REGIME WAS THE HEAD OF THE  ABBOTTABAD MILITARY FACILITY, WAS HE NOT?
WELL DIFFERENT TRAINING INSTITUTION, YES, INDEED. SAME AS WEST POINT. THE PAKISTAN MILITARY ACADEMY. AND OTHER TRAINING INSTITUTIONS. THERE'S NO COMBAT TROOPS. HOWEVER THIS IS A HILL STATION THIS IS A TOURIST RESORT AND ALL PEOPLE GOING TO THE NORTHERN  AREAS INTO THE MOUNTAINS ARE FROM THIS. IT'S A TOWN OF ABOUT 800,000 PEOPLE, CIVILIANS AND MILITARY ALL INTERMINGLED. THERE ARE NO WALLED COMPOUNDS AS WE PRESUME THERE WAS A GARRISONED TOWN. NOT AT ALL. SO THEREFORE... AND THEN SINCE HE WAS NOT USING ANY TELEPHONES IT WAS ONLY HUMAN INTELLIGENCE  THAT YOU... ONE WAS BANKING ON. HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS IF THE PEOPLE AROUND KNOW...
Jon: .
THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE SUSPICIONS ABOUT ONE WEIRD HOUSE  WHERE THEY BURNED THEIR TRASH AND DON'T HAVE A PHONE. LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, WOULD YOU BE SUSPICIOUS OF US IF THIS IS REVERSED AND WE ARE HARBORING  JOHN... I DON'T KNOW WHAT... WHO THE CORRESPONDING FIGURE WOULD BE AND HE LIVED A HALF... YOU  KNOW, A HALF MILE AWAY FROM WEST POINT OR A HALF MILE AWAY FROM LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE AND WE  WENT TO YOU AND SAID LA NINA. WOULDN'T YOU THINK WE WERE BEING DISINGENUOUS? BECAUSE YOU TRUST US?
THERE ARE INTELLIGENCE FAILURES, THIS IS NOT A CASE OF COMPLICITY. IT'S CERTAINLY A CASE OF NEGLIGENCE. AFTER ALL, IF YOU GO BACK TO 9/11, WASN'T C.I.A. THE MOST POWERFUL ORGANIZATION? THIGH DIDN'T KNOW 18 PEOPLE WERE TRAINING TO ATTACK YOUR WORLD TRADE CENTER.
NO, THEY DID, THEY JUST DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ELSE.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW FOUR AIRCRAFT WERE HIJACKD FROM FOUR DIFFERENT AIRFIELDS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW TWO OF THEM LEFT...
Jon: BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THERE IS A HISTORY OF SUSPICION NOT JUST FROM THE  UNITED STATES BUT FROM ENGLAND AND INDIA THAT THE I.S.I. HAS TIES TO SOME MILITANT GROUPS  SOME ASSOCIATED WITH AL QAEDA, SOME ASSOCIATED WITH KASHMIRI ISLAMISTS, SOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE HA CABNY NETWORK IN AFGHANISTAN. YOU WOULD AT MID-THERE IS A LOT OF SUSPICION COALESCED AROUND THIS. HAQQANI. THIS IS NOT AN ENORMOUS LEFT TURN TO SUGGEST THERE MIGHT BE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE PAKISTANI  INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THAT HAVE SYMPATHIES. I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES, WE TIER ONES THAT WORKED WITH THEM TO MAKE HOLY WAR IN AFGHANISTAN  WHEN WE WERE FIGHTING THE RUSSIANS. SO WE KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE.
ROGUE ELEMENTS WITHIN A FEW OF THEM IS POSSIBLE. BUT IF YOU THINK I.S.I. AS AN ORGANIZATION HAD SOME OTHER PLANS THAN WHAT IT IS SHOWING, THAT IS WRONG. THAT IS WHAT IS OBJECTIONABLE. THAT IS AN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN DELIVERING SINCE 1979 WHEN WE  FOUGHT THE SOVIETS TOGETHER AND IT WAS I.S.I. IN THE FOREFRONT THEY'RE DELIVERING. THEN ONWARDS. NOW I.S.I. DOES WHATEVER THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT IS WHATEVER THEY ARE ORDERED TO DO. WHEN YOU'RE TALKED OF INDIA, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY ALL TOGETHER. I.S.I. AND INDIA HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CONFRONTATIONIST COURSE SINCE OUR INDEPENDENCE SO DON'T  TALK OF THAT. THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE ALL TOGETHER. HERE WE ARE TALKING OF I.S.I. ABETTING OR BEING COMPLICIT WITH AL QAEDA AND TALIBAN WHO HAVE KILLED 4,000 OF OUR SOLDIERS. WHO HAS KILLED 4,000 ARMY MEN OF PAKISTAN? WHO HAS KILLED ABOUT 300 I.S.I. PEOPLE? WHO HAS DONE THAT? SOME CANADIANS? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: CAN I SAY THIS? CAN I SAY THIS? CANADIANS ARE A RUTHLESS PEOPLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I WOULD NOT PUT IT PAST THEM. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK, MORE FROM PERVEZ
