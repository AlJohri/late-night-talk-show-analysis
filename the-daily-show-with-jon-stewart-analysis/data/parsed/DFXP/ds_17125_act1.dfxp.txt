Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE'VE GOT AN EXCELLENT... WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT EPISODE FOLLOWING, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT WAS A  WONDERFUL ENCOUNTER SESSION WITH THE AUDIENCE. (LAUGHTER) WHERE I THOUGHT WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT EACH OTHER. (LAUGHTER) MY GUEST TO WANT THE GREAT SIGOURNEY WEAVER, THE SHOW "POLITICAL ANIMALS."  SHE PLAYS A NEO-CON PAN SDA. (LAUGHTER) NO? THAT'S... THAT'S NOT THE SHOW. YOU HAVE TO ADVOCATE MITT THAT'D BE A PRETTY (BLEEP)ING SHOW. NEO-CON PANDAS. TONIGHT WE START WITH OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC WOES. WE ALL KNOW WHERE TO PLACE THE BLAME FOR OUR WOES.
MORE REGULATION WILL STRANGLE THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
STATES ARE GOING BUST AND CITIES ARE GOING BUST. THEY'RE IN DIRE FINANCIAL SHAPE BECAUSE OF PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS.
THE UNCERTAINTY FACING SMALL BUSINESSES ARE CRIPPLING JOB CREATION IN OUR COUNTRY.
Jon: GOT IT! (LAUGHTER) TOO MUCH REGULATION, GLEDY PUBLIC SECTOR UNION PENSIONS. UNCERTAINTY. (LAUGHTER) THE STALLION OF THE FREE MARKET CANNOT RUN WILD WHILE SADDLED  WITH THESE PROGRESSIVE SACRED COWS FEEDING AT THE TROUGH OF... I... (LAUGHTER) I WENT TO A FARM OVER THE BREAK. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS A PETTING ZOO. (LAUGHTER) IT WAS A KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, MY POINT IS THIS: WHY YOU GOTTA MESS WITH BUSINESS? YOU GOTS TO LETS BUSINESS BE BUSINESS IF YOU WANT THE ECONOMY TO PROSPER. ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT ALSO SEEMS TO BE CAUSING SOME ECONOMIC DISTRESS  I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT RECENTLY.
LIBOR.
LIBOR.
THE LIBOR RATE.
Jon: (AS JERRY LEWIS) THE LIBOR RATE WITH THE LIBOR. WHAT IS THAT? THE PERCENTAGE OF MONEY THAT MUST BE SET ASIDE FOR GOVERNMENT WORKERS' RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS  THAT HAVE SLOWED GROWTH? IS THAT LIBOR? I'LL WRITE DOWN WHAT I THINK LIBOR IS AND THEN YOU TELL ME.
IT'S THE INTEREST RATE THAT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BANKS CHARGE  EACH OTHER TO BORROW MONEY.
Jon: OKAY, I DO NOT THAT V THAT. (LAUGHTER) I WAS DRAWING THE MYTHICAL HALF WILD BOOR HALF LION. (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS RUMORED TO HAVE KILLED ACHILLES' BROTHER JIMMY. (LAUGHTER) THE GREEK. (LAUGHTER) LIBOR IS THE RATE THAT BANKS USE WHEN LENDING MONEY TO EACH OTHER. AND SO LIBOR BECOMES THE BENCHMARK FOR, REALLY, ALL MONEY LENDING ON, LET'S SAY, EARTH. CREDIT CARDS, STUDENT LOAN, ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES. IF YOU SEE A NUMBER OUTSIDE THE BANK'S PLACARD WITH BALLOONS TIED TO IT IT HAS BEEN SET IN  SOME WAY BY LIBOR. SORRY, I INTERRUPTED YOU.
THIS LIBOR RATE WAS MANIPULATE BADE NUMBER OF BANKS DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.
Jon: WHAT AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG... WAIT, WHAT DID SHE SAY IN (LAUGHTER)  VERY SWEET LADY JUST DELIVERED TERRIBLE NEWS! I'M GOING TO NEED TO SEE SOME VERY CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT BANKS KNOWINGLY AND DELIBERATELY  SUBMITTED FALSE LIBOR RATES.
BUT WHAT WE'RE NOW SEEING VERY CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF IS  THAT THE BANKS DELIBERATELY AND KNOWINGLY SUBMITTED FALSE DATA. (LAUGHTER) OKAY, THE BANKS SUBMITTED FALSE DATA. PROBABLY FOR THE GOOD OF THE ENTIRE ECONOMY, AS A LIQUIDITY ENHANCEMENT THAT SERVES ALL OF  MANKIND AND...
...TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BANKERS! NEVER TRUST ANYTHING THAT RIMES WITH WEST BANKERS. (LAUGHTER) YOU MAY BE THINKING, HOW DO YOU MANIPULATE THE WORLD'S MOST  CENTRAL KEY INTEREST RATE? PROBABLY GOT TO GO CRUISE "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE" DROP IN WITH A LASER SECURITY SYSTEM AND  HACK IN USING REMOTE CONTROL NANO TECH SPIDER DRONES. OR...
IT'S ARRANGED BY A TRADE GROUP OF BANKS IN LONDON EVERYDAY AROUND LUNCHTIME IN  LONDON ABOUT 16 BANKS SUBMIT TO THE BRITISH BANKERS' ASSOCIATION  DAY THAT THAT IS AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST THOSE BANKS TO BORROW FROM EACH OTHER.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT  THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM BEING CONTROLLED BY SIX ILLUMINATI MEMBERS IN THE  BASEMENT OF THE VATICAN. (LAUGHTER) IT'S ACTUALLY JUST 16 LONDON LUNCH BUDDIES. (LAUGHTER) JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHAT WOULD PUBLIC E-MAILS LOOK LIKE WITH A SCHEME SUCH AS THIS?
TRADERS E-MAILING EACH OTHER SAYING "HEY, I REALLY NEED YOU  TO... I REALLY NEED MY RATES TO COME IN AT A CERTAIN RATE. IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN I'M GOING TO GET KILLED." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO THESE E-MAILS, TRADERS FOR THESE BANKS WOULD CALL UP THE BANK OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH REPORTING THEIR  BANK'S LIBOR BORROWING RATE AND ASK THESE INDIVIDUALS TO LIE. JUST A LITTLE. ABOUT THE RATE. WHAT DO E-MAILS LOOK LIKE POST-LYE.
QUOTE, DUDE, I OWE YOU BIG TIME. COME OVER AFTER WORK AND I'M OPENING A BOTTLE OF BOLLINGER. >>"
WHEN I WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THIS YOUR NAME WILL BE IN GOLDEN LETTERS. THE REPLY FROM LONDON? "I WOULD PREFER THIS NOT BE IN ANY BOOK." (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT IT BEING IN AN INDICTMENT? (LAUGHTER) WHO WHO IS RUNNING THESE BANKS? HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?
RICH RICHIE, HE IS PROBABLY THE MOST SENIOR PERSON AT BARCLAYS. BOB DIMON FIRED AMID THE LIBOR SCANDAL.
Jon: ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING ME? NO. RICH RICHIE? AND MR. DIAMOND? (LAUGHTER) IS THIS REAL OR A DICKENS NOVEL? HERE'S HOW WEIRD THIS STORY IS. ONE OF THE FEW GOOD GUYS IN THE STORY IS A BANKER WHO DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE RIGGING OF RATES. HIS NAME? ALEXANDER HOARE. (LAUGHTER) HE'S A SCION OF LONDON'S ESTEEM HOARE AND COMPANY. THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS. EVEN THE HOARES ARE DISGUSTED. AN EIGHTH-GENERATION HOARE FROM A LONG LINE OF LONDON HOARES.
EARLIER WE TOLD YOU THE THREE THINGS WE'D ALL HEARD ABOUT THAT  WERE KILLING OUR ECONOMY WERE, NUMBER ONE OVERREGULATION.
THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THE BANKS SUBMIT THAT DATA.
Jon: OKAY, SO NOT OVERREGULATION IN THIS CASE. SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE LIKE UNDERREGULATION. SO IT MUST BE THE NUMBER-TWO REASON, THE UNCERTAINTY IN THINGS LIKE OBAMACARE AND  DODD-FRANK THAT'S KILLING US.
THEY'RE MONK KISS AROUND WITH LIBOR. I TALKED TO ONE FRIEND WHO WORKS ON WALL STREET HE SAID "THIS IS  LIKE FINDING OUT THE WHOLE WORLD IS BUILT ON QUICKSAND."
Jon: OKAY, SO AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT'S BUILT ON. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A TYPE OF CERTAINTY SO AN UNREGULATED FREE MARKET CAN ALSO  APPARENTLY CREATE UNCERTAINTY AND SOME BANKERS MADE A FEW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  BETWEEN EACH OTHER RIGGING THEIR BESTS ON INTEREST RATES AND KEPT INTEREST RATES ARTIFICIALLY LOW  DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. IT STILL DOESN'T EXCUSE ECONOMY-WRECKING REASON NUMBER THREE-- PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS AND  THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSE WITH THEIR MASSIVE PENSION DEMANDS.
THE VICTIMS IN THIS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT ARE THE MUNICIPALITIES AND THE CITIES  AND ANYBODY WHO GOT PAID LESS THAN A FAIR MARKET INTEREST RATE ON BONDS
OH, RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) THE PUBLIC SECTOR PENSIONS ARE UNDERFUNDED IN PART BECAUSE THE  BONDS THEY OWN ARE PAYING TOO LOW A YIELD THANKS TO 16 SUITED TURD MONKEYS IN LONDON. (LAUGHTER)
THE CITY OF BALTIMORE AND THE FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE UNION OF  NEW BRITAIN, CONNECTICUT, HAVE ALREADY FILED A LAWSUIT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE OR TWO MILLION  DOLLARS, THAT'S A FIRE COMPANY.
Jon: YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU TAKE OUT A MORTGAGE TO REBUILD YOUR  BURNED-DOWN HOUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A GREAT RATE. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE)
