FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VERY KIND OF YOU. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW MOVIE "PHILOMENA" STEVE COOGAN. THE GREAT STEVE COOGAN IS IN OUR STUDIO TONIGHT. WE'LL BE TALKING TO HIM. BUT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- TOP STORY TONIGHT, I'M ABOUT TO ROLL A CLIP. CHANCES ARE WHEN YOU HEAR THIS CLIP, WHEN YOU SEE THIS CLIP, YOU WILL APPLAUD. TWO REASONS:  ONE, IT WILL BE A FEEBLE ATTEMPT TO KEEP YOURSELVES WARM WHICH LET'S FACE FACTS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SERIOUSLY EVEN INSIDE HERE I SEE THE AUDIENCE LOOKING AROUND TO SEE WHICH ONE OF THEM TO EAT FIRST. [LAUGHTER] AND TWO, YOU WILL APPLAUD BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE ARE MORAL DEGENERATES. ROLL THE CLIP.
IN COLORADO TODAY, THE START A BRAND NEW INDUSTRY AS THAT STATE BECAME THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO MAKE IT LEGAL FOR MOST PEOPLE TO BUY MARIJUANA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'M SAYING SOMETHING RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW:  I KNOW MY AUDIENCE. [LAUGHTER] RECREATIONAL POT IS NOW LEGAL IN COLORADO WHICH WILL, ACCORDING TO LESTER HOLT, CREATE A BRAND NEW INDUSTRY IN THAT STATE. A POT-SELLING INDUSTRY. WOW, BRAND NEW. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUESS LUCKY FOR COLORADO ITS STORES SELLING WATER PIPES FOR TOBACCO AND BLACK LIGHT POSTERS INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE EASILY REPURPOSED FOR THIS NEW POT INDUSTRY. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE LIKE THE WILD WEST IN COLORADO THERE'S STRINGENT LIMITS ON THE LAW.
POT PURCHASERS MUST BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OLD.
Jon: CHECK. RULES OUT THE KIDDIES.
YOU CAN'T LIGHT UP IN PUBLIC AND POLICE WARN YOU STILL CAN'T DRIVE HIGH.
Jon: WHAT? WELL THEN RIDDLE ME THIS BATMAN, WHY DOES TACO BELL HAVE A DRIVE-THRU? THAT, MY FRIENDS -- THAT IS ENTRAPMENT. CAN'T DRIVE HIGH THAT IS ENTRAPMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] GETTING STRICTER HERE. ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF MARIJUANA?
POT SHOPS CANNOT OPEN UNTIL 8:00 A.M. AND MUST CLOSE BY MIDNIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU KNOW GIVEN YOUR CLIENTEL I'M SURE YOU COULD HAVE GONE WITH NOON TO MIDNIGHT. BUT IT'S FINE. 16 HOURS A DAY IS FINE FOR RECREATIONAL USERS TO HEAD TO THE LOCAL POTTERY BARN, IF YOU WILL, GET A SWEET BUZZ ON. ANY RESTRICTION ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN HAVE.
AN INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE ONE OUNCE OF MARIJUANA IN THEIR POSSESSION.
Jon: SO NO RESTRICTIONS. HOLY (bleep). AN OUNCE? THAT IS A LOT OF POT. THAT FOR RECREATIONAL USE OR INDUSTRIAL USE? AN OUNCE WAS A LOT OF THE LOW GRADE POT I USED TO SMOKE. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW FAR AN EDUCATED POT CONSUMER COULD STRETCH AN OUNCE OF TODAY'S HYDROPONIC NON 1980'S JERSEY SCHWAG POT. THE MOST INTERESTING TAKEPOT. CAME FROM  BILL O'REILLY'S THE OLD TIMEY AMERICANA RESTORATION HOUR.
IF YOU USE ANY INTOXICATING AGENT YOUR GOAL IS TO LEAVE REALITY. YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF MIND. YOU WANT TO GET HIGH, BLASTED, WHATEVER. SOME ADULTS CAN HANDLE THAT,  SOME CANNOT. IT'S LITERALLY RUSSIAN ROULETTE.
Jon: LITERALLY? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY? I THINK THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BONG HIT AND POINTING A LOADED GUN AT YOUR OWN SKULL IS THAT THE GUN CAN KILL YOU INSTANTLY AND MUST NEVER BE CRIMINALIZED OR RESTRICTED IN ANY WAY EVER -- EVER! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND THEN -- BY THE WAY, I WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE AUDIENCE AT HOME, THEY ARE APPLAUDING IRONICALLY. [LAUGHTER] THEN THE JUST SAY NO PART OF THE PROGRAM TOOK A BIT OF A HAIRPIN TURN.
NOW MORE BAD NEWS, COMBINE THE DRUG ASPECT WITH THE INTERNET. ACCORDING TO THE REPORT BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, 75% OF 12-17 YEAR OLDS IN THE U.S. HAVE CELL PHONES AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM TEXT. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED? HOW DO WE GO FROM JUST SAY NO AND WHAT IS WITH ALL THE BEEP BEEP, BOOM BOOM MACHINES AND WITH THE LOL AND THE TTYL AND THE MUSIC AND THE DANCING AND THE PELVIS AND WHOA! YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A SURPRISING EXAMPLE OF A SOCIETY AND CULTURE THAT IS GETTING IT RIGHT HERE THAT PERHAPS UNDERCUTS THE INHERENT MESSAGE IN EVERYTHING YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AT FOX HAVE SAID.
IN CHINA THEY TEACH KIDS TO COMPETE, TO BE DISCIPLINED, TO LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD, NOT HERE.
Jon: WHY CAN'T AMERICA BE MORE LIKE THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHILE THE TRUTH IS THE CHINESE USED TEXT MESSAGING MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD, I GUESS THE THOUGHT BEHIND THIS IS, YOU COULD KEEP KIDS FROM TEXTING SO MUCH BY RESTRICTING THE SIZE OF THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH CENTRAL PLANNING. MY FAVORITE PART, HOWEVER, WAS WATCHING A COLUMBIA PROFESSOR, AN EXPERT ON DRUG POLICY TAKE IN THIS NEW DRUG AND TESTINGTAKE IN PHENOMENON.
KIDS AND POT YOU DON'T RECOMMEND THAT, RIGHT?
OF COURSE NOT. I DON'T RECOMMEND KIDS TAKING ALCOHOL OR SMOKING.
I APPRECIATE THAT. TEXTING YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADDICTION. IT'S GOING CRAZY. ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?
I'M NOT AWARE IT'S AN ADDICTION. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WAIT, WAIT SMART BLACK GUY WITH DREADS DISAGREES WITH ME, I WILL DO THE OPPOSITE, GET ME A BALD WHITE IDIOT.
TEXTING, THE INCESSANT USE OF FACEBOOK, THE USE OF MARIJUANA NOW.
Jon: YOU'LL DO JUST FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU YOU WERE RAILING AGAINST THE MARIJUANA TEXTING INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. BY THE WAY FOR EXTRA BONUS PLEASURE WATCH THE GUESTS REACTION TO DR. ABLOW'S EXPERTISE.
EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO CAN IDENTIFY THIS AS A HUGE PROBLEM ARE USING TEXTING. IT DEPOSITS THEM IN A VIRTUAL WORLD WHERE THEIR FEELINGS DON'T NEED TO HAVE INTEGRITY. WHERE THEIR INTENTIONS CAN BE THE SAME AS A POT SMOKERS, NONMOTIVATIONAL, LOOKING FOR THE NEXT HIGH. YOU SAY TO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I GUESS I COULD SAY YOU ARE A (bleep) IDIOT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT, OF COURSE, MANY ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES ARE WRINGING THEIR HANDS EVEN FORMER POT SMOKERS LIKE DAVID BROOKS.
MOST OF US AGE OUT OF MARIJUANA USE BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT EXCITING WHEN YOU FIND MORE SERIOUS PLEASURES. I THINK THE STATE SHOULD DISCOURAGE THE USE OF MARIJUANA ON MORAL AND HEALTH GROUNDS.
Jon: NOW THAT I NO LONGER USE IT. YOU DON'T GET IT BROOKS. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE  EXUBERANCE OF THE FEAST. A GUY WROTE HAPPILY ABOUT HAVING A ORGY OF EXCESS. HIS HEAD FOGGED WITH WINE AND BOURBON. HE REALIZED HE HATED LIVING IN THE LILY LIVERED WHERE EVERYTHING IS A PALLID PARODY OF ITSELF. HE WROTE GONE IS THE GRAND AND POINTLESS GESTURE. I BELIEVE THAT STIRRING TRIBUTE TO HEDONISM WAS WRITTEN BY -- (bleep) DAVID BROOKS. HOW WEIRD IS THAT? I WONDER HOW HE FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
