FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS HERE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE GUESTS IS HERE TONIGHT. FROM "THE GOLDBERGS", TELEVISION'S "THE GOLDBERGS" JEFF GARWIN IS HERE TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, A CRISIS BREWING RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK. IT BEGAN LAST WEEK WITH REMARKS FROM GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.
IT'S THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THIS STATE A MODERATE PARTY OR AN EXTREME CONSERVATIVE PARTY? WHO ARE THEY? WHO ARE THESE THEY EXTREME CONSERVATIVES WHO ARE RIGHT TO LIFE, PRO-ASSAULT WEAPON, ANTI-GAY? IS THAT WHO THEY ARE? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE THAT MANY  SYLLABLES IN GAY. EITHER HE IS SPENDING WAY TOO MUCH TIME WITH SENATOR SCHUMER OR MY GRANDMOTHER IS THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK. WHO ARE THEEEEEYYYY?
IF THAT'S WHO THEY ARE, IF THEY ARE THE EXTREME CONSERVATIVES THEY HAVE NO PLACE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Jon: WHOA. THAT'S A LITTLE ROUGH. CUOMO WAS ADVISING NEW YORK'S REPUBLICAN PARTY TO CLARIFY ITS IDENTITY TO STAY VIABLE IN THIS LEFT LEANING STATE BUT IT ACCIDENTALLY CAME OUT AS (bleep) (bleep), (bleep) (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] NOT HIS BEST MOMENT. AS WE KNOW MINORITY GROUPS IN NEW YORK CAN BE VERY SENSITIVE. ONE TYPE OF NEW YORK  MINORITY IN PARTICULAR.
NO PLACE IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK? GOVERNOR, YOU DON'T WANT ME. TELL ME SPECIFICALLY WHY I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BE HERE. I'M LEAVING. AS SOON AS I CAN GET OUT OF HERE, I AM OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WOW. WHAT A WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RESPONSE TO THAT SEAN HANNITY SAYS AS SOON AS I CAN GET OUT I'M LEAVING BUT HE HAS TO KNOW IT'S NOT EAST GERMANY. YOU CAN REALLY GET OUT ANY TIME. LARGE METROPOLITAN AREA WE'VE GOT AIRPORTS, INTERSTATES, SEAPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU COULD WALK. [ LAUGHTER ] I WOULD CARRY YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP MR. HANNITY FROM TAKING THE GRIEVANCE TRAIN TO VICTIMTOWN WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION HE HAS BEEN ON.
WHY SHOULD I MOVE FORWARD WHEN MY GOVERNOR SAID THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME IN NEW YORK.
MAYBE HE DOESN'T GET IT.
WHAT IS THE STORY ARE YOU LEAVING NEW YORK?
WE HOPE FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE. THIS IS AN AWFUL THING WHAT HE SAID. TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE AMERICANS ARE NOT WELCOME IN THE STATE. PRO-TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE THERE'S NO PLACE FOR YOU IN NEW YORK.
Jon:. ♪ THERE'S NO PLACE FOR US, ANTI-GAY, PRO-GUN NO PLACE ♪ ♪ TAKE MY HAND IF YOU ARE NOT A DUDE ♪ [LAUGHTER] SO HANNITY WANTS TO RELOCATE. IT'S A PRETTY SWEET PRIZE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT.
SEAN, COME ON DOWN. LOOK AT OUR WEATHER. YOU PROBABLY HAVE A JACKET TODAY. WE'RE IN SHORT SLEEVES, THE FISHING CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
Jon: BETWEEN THE GATORS AND THE POSSUMS AND PALMETTO BUGS NO ONE HERE HAS EVEN NOTICED I'M A HAIRLESS SNAKE MAN! I'M A HAIRLESS SNAKE MAN. I RUN YOUR STATE AND I'M A HAIRLESS SNAKE -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE DID THAT WITHOUT ME EVEN PLAYING A NOTE. SCOTT'S REPTILIAN PAST LEAVES AN OPENING FOR RICK PERRY TO WOO HANNITY.
I'M A MAN NOT WANTED IN THE STATE I WAS BORN IN ANYMORE AND THERE ARE TWO STATES ON MY LIST, TEXAS AND FLORIDA.
THE OLD MOTTO ABOUT TEXAS BEING THE FRIENDSHIP STATE, IT SHOWS THROUGH IN HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE AND YOU ARE CERTAINLY -- YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOU ARE WELCOME AND YOU'LL BE TREATED LIKE A TRUE FRIEND.
Jon: THAT'S ALL HE IS LOOKING FOR. [ LAUGHTER ] FRIEND, JUST LOOKING FOR A PLACE WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL PEOPLE EVEN THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIM. A GOVERNOR WHO WOULD NEVER SUGGEST IF YOU DON'T FIT THE MAJORITY MOLD OR LIKE THEIR POLITICS YOU BEST MOVE ON. LIKE HOW IN TEXAS GAY MARRIAGE IS ILLEGAL.
TEXANS HAVE MADE A DECISION ABOUT MARRIAGE, AND THAT IF THERE'S SOME OTHER STATE THAT HAS A MORE LENIENT VIEW THAN TEXAS, MAYBE IT'S A BETTER PLACE FOR THEM TO LIVE.
Jon: WOW, SOUNDS KIND OF WHAT SEAN HATES ABOUT OUR GOVERNOR. I GUESS IT'S CALLED THE FRIENDSHIP STATE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO BE FRIENDS. SO SEAN HANNITY IS DISGUSTED! DISGUSTED! HE IS DISGUSTED AT THE NEW YORK GOVERNOR'S INTOLERANCE. HE IS THREATENING TO MOVE TO A PLACE WHOSE GOVERNOR SAID PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME THING. HE HAS A CASE OF SELECTIVE UNDERGARMENT BUNCHING OR SUB. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE?
I WOULDN'T PAY A 10% STATE TAX IN FLORIDA OR TEXAS. I WOULD SAVE A LOT OF MONEY.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH THE TAKERS IN THIS STATE HAVE BEEN EXPLOITING HIS SUCCESS. BECAUSE IF HE GOES THERE'S ONE LESS STATE-FUNDED COCAINE PARTY FOR OUR HOMELESS. WE MUST KEEP HIM. BUT HOW? [LAUGHTER]
WE KNOW YOU ARE MAD AT US AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE, OCCUPY WALL STREET, GOVERNOR CUOMO, THAT WEIRD SMELL, NEW YORKERS MADE A LOT OF BIG MISTAKES BUT WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE. JUST PLEASE STAY.
STAY.
STAY.
WE CAN'T LOSE YOU. STAY.
YO SEAN MAN, YOU CAN'T LEAVE WE NEED YOU DOG.
I WILL LOSE MY ACCENT IF YOU STAY. LET'S GRAB A BEER AND WATCH THE GAME. HOW IS THAT?
WE'LL MAKE SEX IN THE CITY TOURS SEAN AND THE CITY TOURS. IF YOU STAY, WE'LL CUT OFF OUR HOODIES.
WE'RE IN LOVE BUT WE'LL MARRY WOMEN INSTEAD. WE'LL STOP SELLING HALAL FOOD. WE'LL SELL APPLE PIE.
THAT KEYSTONE PIPELINE WE'LL RUN IT THROUGH CENTRAL PARK NO (bleep) PROBLEM.
WHAT IS A HOODIE WITHOUT A HOOD?
THE CITY DEPENDS UPON JOB CREATORS LIKE YOU, SEAN. WE'LL GIVE YOU THE PERKS YOU DESERVE.
WE'LL NAME A STREET AFTER REAGAN. HELL, WE'LL NAME THEM ALL AFTER REAGAN.
WORRIED ABOUT YOUR COMMUTE HOME, NO PROBLEM.
THIS A-TRAIN IS NOW RUNNING DIRECTLY TO SEAN'S HOUSE.
PLEASE. STAY.
STAY.
STAY. ♪ STAY MR. HANNITY STAY  ♪ WHAT WILL WE DO IF YOU HAVE GONE AWAY ♪ ♪ WHO WOULD WE TAX TILL HIS MONEY WAS GONE WHO WOULD WE IMPOSE SOCIALISM UPON ♪ ♪ STAY MR. HANNITY, STAY PRO-LIFE AND ANTI-GAY ♪ ♪ STAY IN YOUR SECOND HOME DON'T DISAPPEAR FOREVER LIKE ALAN COLMES ♪ ♪ PLEASE, MR. HANNITY, PLEASE  ♪ ♪ KEEP YOUR UNIQUE BRAND OF FAR RIGHT  INSANITY SAFELY AWAY FROM THE REST OF HUMANITY. ♪ STAY MR.
