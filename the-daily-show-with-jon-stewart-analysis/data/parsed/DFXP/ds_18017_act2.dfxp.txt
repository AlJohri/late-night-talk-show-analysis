(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW -- FEELS GOOD TO HAVE  POWER! (LAUGHTER)  MUST CHARGE PHONE. YOU KNOW, POLITICS IS A CYNICAL  BUSINESS. BUT THERE'S ONE PLACE WHERE THE  IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY ARE STILL  PURE. MIDDLE SCHOOL ELECTIONS. (LAUGHTER)  WE SET OUT TO RUIN THAT BY  SENDING JOHN OLIVER AND A  DOCUMENTARY CREW TO TAKE OVER AN  EIGHTH GRADE STUDENT COUNCIL  ELECTION. I PRESENT TO YOU PART ONE OF OUR  NEW THREE-PART SERIES "THE  STRATEGIST."
WOODCLIFF MIDDLE SCHOOL WAS  IN FULL CAMPAIGN MODE AS TWO  VERY DIFFERENT CANDIDATES RAN  FOR CLASS PRESIDENT.
MY NAME IS KYLE PEARLMAN.
I'M LOREN, I'M 13, I'M IN  EIGHTH GRADE.
I'M RUNNING FOR STUDENT  COUNCIL PRESIDENT.
STRATEGIST JOHN OLIVER'S  FIRST TASK WAS PICKING WHICH  CANDIDATE TO WORK WITH. FOR SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO MAKE  HIS CHOICE HE TURNED TO GRIZZLED  25-YEAR CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT MARK  O'HARA.
MOST CONSULTANTS ARE  CONCERNED ABOUT TWO THINGS AND  TWO THINGS ONLY: WINNING THE  CAMPAIGN AND MAKING SURE THEY GET PAID.
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S SIMPLE.
THAT MAKES MY JOB A WHOLE LOT  EASIER. LOREN, WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE  PRESIDENT?
WELL, I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS  ON ANTI-BULLYING SO IT JUST IS  COMPLETELY ELIMINATED FROM THE  SCHOOL.
UM -- JUST BRAGGING RIGHTS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WOULD YOU DESCRIBE  YOURSELF AS A POPULAR PERSON?
NOT EXACTLY.
YEAH, I WOULD.
IF YOU WERE AN ANIMAL, LOREN,  WHAT ANIMAL WOULD YOU BE?
A CAT.
I WOULD PROBABLY BE A SHARK.
GOOD ANSWER. WHAT KIND OF SHARK?
A GREAT WHITE.
GREAT ANSWER. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE GOT  YOURSELF A CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
GREAT.
HEY, LOREN, GET OUT. GET OUT!
IT WAS A PERFECT MATCH.
SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU. WE ARE GOING TO CRUSH HER.
CRUSH HER.
THE TEAM WENT STRAIGHT TO  WORK IN A PURPOSE-BUILT WAR  ROOM.
HEY, CARL, YOU KNOW WHY I  LIKE YOU?
WHY?
BECAUSE PART OF YOU FRIGHTENS  ME AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.
THANKS.
WITH A PROFESSIONAL  STRATEGIST PULLING THE STRINGS  FOR KYLE, SWEET IDEALISTIC YOUNG  LOREN DIDN'T SEEM TO STAND A  CHANCE. UNTIL -- A RIVAL CAMPAIGN  MANAGER SHOWED UP.
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WITH THESE NEW HARDENED  OPERATIVES SET AGAINST EACH  OTHER THINGS WERE ABOUT TO GET  NASTY. BUT WHERE SHOULD THEY BEGIN?
WE DO OPPOSITION RESEARCH ON  OURSELVES SO THAT AT LEAST WE  KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT'S LIKELY TO BE COMING FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
ALL RIGHT, PULL UP YOUR  FACEBOOK PAGE HERE. WHAT'S YOUR PASSWORD?
PUPPIES 123.
(LAUGHS)  OF COURSE IT IS.
WHOA, WHOA! WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT?
OH, NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO  THE NEXT "TWILIGHT" MOVIE. (LAUGHTER)
WHY WOULD YOU WRITE THAT?
WELL, I SAW PART ONE OF THE  MOVIE AND IT WAS AWFUL.
YOU CAN'T HAVE AN OPINION ON  THAT KIND OF STUFF.
WHO'S THAT?
MY AUNT.
GET RID OF HER. WHO'S THAT?
FAMILY FRIEND.
GET RID OF HER! WHO'S THAT?
THAT'S KYLE.
THE KID YOU'RE RUNNING  AGAINST? YOU CAN'T BE FRIENDS WITH HIM! OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.
SO LET ME IS YOU AGAIN, HEY,  KYLE, SEEN "TWILIGHT"?
YEAH, I HAVE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
IT IT'S GREAT! SPAOE.
SEE HOW EASY THAT WAS? ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SOMETHING  YOU FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE  PASSIONATELY IN. (LAUGHTER)
WITH VETTING COMPLETE, THE  CAMPAIGNS NEEDED TO DECIDE WHERE  TO PLACE THEIR FOCUS.
WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? IMAGE OR THE CONTENT OF YOUR  MESSAGE?
IMAGE, ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR A  CONSULTANT TO BUY A WHOLE NEW  WARDROBE FOR A CANDIDATE, TO GET  A DIFFERENT HAIR CUT.
OKAY, WE CAN DO THAT. ♪ YOU BETTER WORK -- ♪
CONSERVATIVE BUT NOT TOO  CONSERVATIVE. WEALTHY BUT NOT ELITIST. ♪ WORK, TURN TO THE LEFT  ♪ WORK, TURN TO THE RIGHT  ♪ WORK, SHANTE -- ♪
THIS FEELS WEIRD.
YOU LOOK GREAT.
THERE WERE JUST 12 DAYS UNTIL  THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE OF THEIR  12-YEAR-OLD LIVES. COMING UP TOMORROW ON "THE  STRATEGIST" THE CAMPAIGN  INTENSIFIES.
YOU LISTEN TO ME YOU (BLEEP). I WILL (BLEEP) YOUR (BLEEP). YOU UNDERSTAND ME? (LAUGHTER)
