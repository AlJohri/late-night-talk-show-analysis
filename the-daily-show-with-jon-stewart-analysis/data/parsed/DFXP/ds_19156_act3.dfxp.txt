(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A JOURNALIST.  HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE UNDERGROUND GIRLS OF KABUL: IN SEARCH OF A HIDDEN RESISTANCE IN AFGHANISTAN." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM JENNY NORDBERG! ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HELLO! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
THANK YOU.
Jon: THIS IS A FASCINATING STORY. AND A LOOK, THE UNDERGROUND GIRLS OF KABUL, LOOKING FOR RESISTANCE. ON LOOKING AT THE BOOK COVER, THE TITLE, I ASSUMED IT WAS THIS IDEA OF SORT OF TRAFFICKING OR YOU KNOW, WOMEN HAVING TO HIDE FROM THE TALIBAN. IT'S A MUCH SORT OF DIFFERENT, STRANGER AND AT TIMES EVEN SADDER STORY. WHAT IS IT?
IT'S THE STORY OF AFGHAN GIRLS WHO GROW UP AS BOYS. THEY ARE MADE INTO BOYS. THEY'RE DRESSED LIKE BOYS WITH A SHORT HAIRCUT AND A PAIR OF PANTS, BY THEIR PARENTS ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE BOYS ARE WHAT COUNT IN AFGHANISTAN. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SONS, THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR A FAMILY, AND PARENTS THEN WILL SOMETIMES CHOOSE TO BRING UP THE DAUGHTER AS A SON.
Jon: AND THEY BRING UP THE DAUGHTER AS A SON, ONE THE SUPERSTITION THAT GETS THEM SONS AT SOME POINT?
THAT'S ONE REASON.
Jon: YEAH.
EVERY FAMILY WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT REASON.
Jon: RIGHT. AND THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN AFGHANISTAN. MANY TIMES IT'S ALSO TO ADD PRESTIGE TO THE FAMILY. IT'S A DEEPLY PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY. SO A SON WILL CARRY ON THE FAMILY NAME, THE LEGACY, WILL INHERIT THE PROPERTY, SO YOU NEED A SON TO SHOW TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE STRENGTH WITHIN THE FAMILY AND THAT THE FAMILY ISN'T WEAK. IT'S INCUMBENT UPON EVERY WOMAN AND EVERY FAMILY IN AFGHANISTAN TO HAVE SONS, AND THEN IT WILL ALSO AFFORD MORE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, FOR INSTANCE, FOR LITTLE GIRLS. MANY TIMES IN DANGEROUS AREAS, FOR INSTANCE, IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR THEM TO GET TO SCHOOL.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEN DISGUISED AS A BOY, YOU WOULD HAVE RIGHT OF PASSAGE IN A WAY THAT A LITTLE GIRL WOULDN'T HAVE, NORMALLY. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE PRACTICAL ELEMENT. MAYBE YOU NEED A SON TO BRING AN INCOME IN TO THE FAMILY, AND YOU'LL DISGUISE THE GIRL TO GO OUT AND WORK IN A STORE, FOR INSTANCE, AND SUPPORT THE FAMILY BASICALLY.
Jon: AND THIS IS NOT JUS A PURELY RURAL OR OUTSIDE. THIS IS ENDEMIC?
IT CUTS ACROSS, SOCIAL CLASS, LEVEL OF EDUCATION, PROVINCES, ETHNICITY, IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME IN AFGHANISTAN AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A CREATIVE WAY TO BUCK THE SYSTEM IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SOCIETY...
Jon RIGHT.
WITH STRICT GENDER SEGREGATION. YOU KNOW, MEN DO CERTAIN THINGS, WOMEN DO OTHER THINGS. LITTLE GIRLS FROM THE TIME THEY'RE BORN HAVE ESSENTIALLY VERY FEW RIGHTS. SO IT'S A WAY TO PASS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.
Jon: AND THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY TRICKY. YOU KNOW, THIS COMES WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE.
IT DOES.
Jon: WHEN THE GIRLS REACH A LEVEL OF MATURITY OR PUBERTY, THEY MUST GIVE UP THIS IDENTITY AND LOSE ALL THOSE RIGHTS.
WELL, AS MUCH AS THEY CAN PLAY WITH GENDER...
Jon: YES.
IN LITTLE CHILDREN, AND IT'S KIND OF A DON'T ASK DON'T TELL. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THIS IS GOING ON. WHEN A GIRL ENTERS PUBERTY, SHE MUST TAKE THE TRAJECTORY OF A TRADITIONAL AFGHAN WOMAN, WHICH IS TO GET MARRIED, HAVE CHILDREN, IDEALLY SONS, OF HER OWN. SO THERE'S NO REAL, YOU KNOW, DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. THEN THERE ARE, OF COURSE, THOSE WHO RESIST VERY STRONGLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ON THE OTHER SIDE, SO TO SPEAK, WITH ALL THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THAT ARE USUALLY NOT AFFORDED GIRLS IN AFGHANISTAN.
Jon: SO THIS IS A PART THAT I THINK MUST BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE DIFFICULTIES OF BEING IN A WAR-TORN REGION, BEING POVERTY-STRICKEN, GOING THROUGH PUBERTY AND LOSING ALL OF THE FREEDOM THAT YOU EXPERIENCED AS A BOY AND WATCHING OTHER LITTLE BOYS GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS, ENJOYING MORE FREEDOMS, IT MUST BE DEVASTATING IN TERMS OF THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE.
IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT. IT'S A NATURE VERSUS NURTURE EXPERIMENT. LIKE YOU'RE SAYING, IN A CONSTANT HEIGHTENED, TENSE ATMOSPHERE OF WAR THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. SO, WHEN I'VE SPOKEN TO ALL OF THESE SUBJECTS IN MY BOOK, FOR INSTANCE, AND WHAT MY RESEARCH SHOWS IS THAT MANY TIMES THEY, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES AND PROBLEMS.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'VE GROWN UP AS A BOY AND A YOUNG MAN, MANY TIMES IT CAN BE PRACTICALLY VERY DIFFICULT, YOU KNOW, FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE HOW TO GREET WOMEN, HOW TO TALK TO WOMEN, HOW TO COOK, HOW TO WALK LIKE A WOMAN.
Jon: DO THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE PUT BACK FROM HAVING THEIR RIGHTS? IS THERE SOMETHING IN THEIR SOCIETY THAT HAS TAUGHT THEM, OKAY, AT THIS POINT, YOU GO BACK THERE AND YOU DESERVE THAT? AND THAT'S... IS IT A LEVELLING?
WELL IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A CHOICE BY THE PARENTS MANY TIMES. SOME LITTLE GIRLS ARE BORN AND INTRODUCED TO THE VILLAGE AND THE NEIGHBORS AS THE FAMILY'S SON.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU THINK OF AS FREE WILL AND THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE FOR THESE GIRLS. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU'VE GROWN UP FOR 10, YOU KNOW, 13, 12, 15 YEARS --
Jon: SURE.
ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S, YOU DO SEE THAT SOCIETY IS SEGREGATED. LIKE ONE OF THESE 15-YEAR-OLD GIRLS SAID TO ME, I SEE HOW WOMEN ARE TREATED HERE, WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM? I WILL REMAIN A BOY, I WANT TO REMAIN A BOY ALWAYS.
Jon: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A SECOND? I WANT TO FIND OUT, IN SOCIETIES THAT UNDERGO THIS TYPE OF TUMULT AND WAR, GENERALLY RIGHTS ADVANCE, BUT AND IT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN AFGHANISTAN AND SOME OF THESE OTHER PATRIARCHAL SOCIETIES. I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. WE'LL COME BACK, ON THE WEB. "THE UNDERGROUND GIRLS OF KABUL," IT'S ON THE SHELVES NOW, JENNY NORDBERG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
