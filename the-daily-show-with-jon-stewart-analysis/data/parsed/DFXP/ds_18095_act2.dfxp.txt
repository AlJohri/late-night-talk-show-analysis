( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HEY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. IF A FEW MINUTES WE'LL BE JOINED  BY KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON THE  GREAT SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS. HUTCHINSON'S SEAT OCCUPIED BY  ANOTHER REPUBLICAN. YOU MAY KNOW HIM AS TED CRUZ, AN  EMAIL HE FIRES OFF AS A CRUISE  MISSILE. THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO WE HAVE  FOR HIM. MONTHS INTO TED CRUZ'S FIRST  TERM, HOW IS HE GETTING ALONG?
HE'S ANGERING VETERAN  DEMOCRATS WITH CALIFORNIA'S  DIANNE FEINSTEIN CALLING HIM ARROGANT DURING THE DEBATE OVER  GUN CONTROL.
I'M NOT A SIXTH GRADER. Jon: OF COURSE NOT. NO, SIXTH GRADER WITH ANY  SENSE OF SELF-RESPECT WOULD  STILL BE IN THE SENATE. BUT THOSE ARE DEMOCRATS, OF  COURSE. THEY'RE GOING TO HATE SENATOR  TED CRUZ. AS LONG AS TED'S OWN PARTY HAS  HIS BACK.
HE'S ALSO RAISING HACKLES  AMONG THE OLD GUARD IN HIS OWN  PARTY. WHEN HE QUESTIONED DEFENSE  SECRETARY NOMINEE CHUCK HAGEL'S  FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES, JOHN McCAIN GAVE CRUZ A SCOLDING. McCAIN WENT ON TO CALL CREWS A  WACKO BIRD.
Jon: OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T. DID YOU NOT CALL SOMEONE A WACKO  BIRD BECAUSE THAT IS A WEIRD  INSULT. AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT  THAT MEANS. I MEAN YOU'RE NOT A SIXTH  GRADER. SO WHAT DID CRUZ SAY TO HAGEL? TO GET SLAPPED WITH THE WACKO  BIRD LABEL.
I DON'T KNOW IF MR. HAGEL HAS  RECEIVED FUNDS DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY FROM FOREIGN SOURCES. IT IS AT A MINIMUM RELEVANT TO  KNOW IF THAT $200,000 THAT HE  DEPOSITED IN HIS BANK ACCOUNT CAME DIRECTLY FROM SAUDI ARABIA,  CAME DIRECTLY FROM NORTH KOREA. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. IT MAY BE THAT HE SPOKE AT  RADICAL OR EXTREME GROUPS OR  ANTI-ISRAEL GROUPS AND ACCEPTED FINANCIAL COMPENSATION. WE DON'T KNOW.
Jon: HE MIGHT [BLEEP]. I DON'T KNOW. THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS ONE MUST  RAISE IN A CONFIRMATION HEARING  WITH A COLLEAGUE OF MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL WHO  THINK... I DON'T KNOW. DOES HE? DOES HE? HERE'S THE THING. DOES HE HAVE A PUPPY? SO CRUZ IS NOT A WACKO BIRD. HE'S JUST A "TAKE THINGS OUT OF  CONTEXT TO CREATE A FALSE  IMPRESSION OF GUILT" BIRD. SO IT SEEMS ACROSS THE BOARD THE  REVIEWS ON CRUZ HAVE COME IN.
HE'S BEEN CALLED THE MOST  HATED MAN IN THE SENATE.
Jon: WOW. THAT'S NO EASY FEAT. THAT'S BEING LIKE THE LOWEST  RATED SHOW ON NBC. SO YOU THINK YOU CAN BELCH? IT'S ALREADY BEEN RENEWED. FOR A SENATOR SO WIDELY DESPISED  BY HIS COLLEAGUES THERE'S ONLY  ONE PLACE TO GO.
TED CRUZ IS CONSIDERING A  PRESIDENTIAL RUN.
Jon: YES. WHY LIMIT YOURSELF TO BEING  HATED BY YOUR COLLEAGUES WHEN  YOU COULD BE HATED BY THE WHOLE  COUNTRY? OR MAYBE HE'S JUST A MODERN-DAY  MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON  STANDING UP TO HIS COLLEAGUES ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN VALUES.
PART OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THIS  ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO GET AS MANY AMERICANS AS POSSIBLE  DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SO THAT  THEY THE DEMOCRATS CAN STAY IN POWER IN PERPETUITY.
THERE IS AN ONGOING EFFORT TO  UNDERMINE UNITED STATES  SOVEREIGNTY. WE NEED TO AUDIT THE FED. EXTENDING BACKGROUND CHECKS TO  PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN  PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. I BELIEVE IT WOULD PUT US  INEXORABLY ON THE PATH TO A  NATIONAL GUN REGISTRY.
Jon: AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE  THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS LACED  WITH FLUORIDE TO DULL YOU INTO HANDING OVER YOUR GUNS. THE GUY IS JUST YOUR RUN OF THE  MILL CONSTITUTIONAL FRINGE RIGHT  TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK IN THE SOCIALIST KENYAN TEA-PARTY TYPE  GUY WHICH IS WHAT THAIKS THIS  LAST PART OF THE STORY SO...
ARE YOU ELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR  PRESIDENT? YOU WERE BORN IN CANADA.
Jon: OH, CANADA. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. OUR BELOVED TEXAS FREEDOM  FIGHTER IS NOTHING BUT A DIRTY  SYRUP GUZZLER. WHAT A TERRIBLE TWIST, EH? HE'S A FOREIGNER. HOW IS CRUZ GOING TO DEAL WITH  THAT ONE?
I'LL LEAVE THOSE QUESTIONS TO  OTHERS TO WORRY ABOUT.
Jon: REALLY? LEAVE IT TO OTHERS. I KNOW SOMEONE WHO COULD LOOK  INTO IT. HEY, DONALD. HEY, DONALD. CALL THE BIRTHER TEAM BACK FROM  HAWAII. BY THE WAY, DID YOU KNOW DONALD  TRUMP'S BIRTH NAME IS [BLEEP] CLOWNSTICK. WHAT'S HE HIDING? YES, THAT'S ALL OVER TWITTER. I HOPE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
