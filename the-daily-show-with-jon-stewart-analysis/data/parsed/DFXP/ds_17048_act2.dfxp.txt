(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MITT ROMNEY, PEOPLE JUST EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET EXCITED. IT'S HIS ROMNEYNESS OR HIS MITTNESS, SOMETHING IS KEEPING THEM FROM REALLY CONNECTING. WE FOUND SOMEONE, OH, YES, WE DID. AL MADRIGAL FILED THIS REPORT.
Reporter: GINGRICH WON HANDILY IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND PERHAPS THAT MIGHT BE  EXPLAINED LESS BY GINGRICH'S CAMPAIGN AND MORE BY HOW REPUBLICANS FEEL ABOUT MITT ROMNEY.
THEY CLEARLY DON'T LIKE MITT ROMNEY.
HE JUST COMES ACROSS AS PHONY.
THE ESTABLISHMENT VIEWS HIM AS OKAY, YEAH, I'D BE OKAY WITH HIM.
HE IS RIGHT.
Reporter: WAIT? WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?
HE IS RIGHT.
Reporter: WHAT THE (BEEP).
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND ANYBODY IN THE HISTORY OF PERK  THAT'S MORE FIRED UP ABOUT ANYBODY THAN I AM MITT ROMNEY.
Reporter: SO THIS MAN, JOE OF GEORGIA, IS FIRED UP ABOUT MITT ROMNEY?
I THINK MITT IS BY FAR THE BEST CANDIDATE.
Reporter: HOW?
HE'S A GREAT LEADER. HE IS A SUPER LEADER. I THINK HE IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST LEADER. HE'S A LEADER.
Reporter: REALLY?
I THINK HE'LL BE THE GREATEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY.
Reporter: YOU KNOW, HISTORY IS PRETTY WRONG.
IT IS. I KNOW THAT'S A BIG STATEMENT.
Reporter: THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE. WHO'S PUTTING YOU UP TO THIS?
NOBODY. ABSOLUTELY NOBODY.
Reporter: IS SOMEONE THREATENING TO HARM YOU IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT MITT ROMNEY SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY?
NO.
Reporter: ARE YOU SURE, JOE?
POSITIVE. I'M POSITIVE. NO. NO, GOSH, NO. I PROMISE THAT. NO. GOSH. NO.
Reporter: JOE WAS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT ROMNEY, YOU'D THINK ROMNEY WAS RON PAUL.
WHEN I HEAR HIM SPEAK, I GET SO FIRED UP, I CAN'T EVEN SLEEP THE NEXT NIGHT. WHEN I GO TO BED AT NIGHT I SAY GO, MITT, GO. WHEN I WAKE UP, I SAY GO, MITT, GO.
Reporter: DO YOU SAY GO, MITT, GO, ALL OVER THE PLACE.
I SAY LET'S NET MITT IN THERE. WE HAVE TO GO THE EXTRA MILE. HE'S GOING TO BE THE GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.
Jim:.
Reporter: HOW MANY TIMES A DAY.
I THINK PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.
Reporter: 8, 10 TIMES A DAY.
IF I'M IN CHURCH I DON'T SAY THAT.
Reporter: YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL I THINK ABOUT THE STOCK MARKET. I LOVE THE STOCK MARKET.
Reporter: I USE BASEBALL.
THAT'S WHATEVER DOES IT FOR YOU.
Reporter: AND HE'S SPREADING THE WORD.
WE LIKE TO MAKE THIS TOWN IS NUMBER ONE TOWN IN AMERICA.
Reporter: WHO ELSE?
WE HAVE ED SINGLETON WHO IS A GREAT BUSINESSMAN. HE'S A BIG SUPPORTER PLUS A LOT OF OTHERS. WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHERS THAT ARE REALLY FIRED UP.
Reporter: WE WENT TO A RALLY. THE MITT MANIA WAS EXPLOSIVE. THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH THESE FOUR GUYS. YOU REALLY ARE A ROMNEY FAN?
YEAH.
Reporter: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A ROMNEY SUPPORTER?
OH, AT LEAST FOR THIS ELECTION.
Reporter: ARE YOU PASSIONATE ABOUT HIM?
NO. BUT I SUPPORT HIM.
Reporter: THESE GUYS SOUNDED LIKE TYPICAL ROMNEY SUPPORTERS. SO WHAT EXPLAINS JOE'S "OFF THE CHARTS" ENTHUSIASM? WAS HIS PASSION MISPLACED?
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON FOREIGN POLICY BUT HE'S A GOOD MAN, I LIKE HIM. I DON'T AGREE WITH RON. I DON'T THINK HE'S AS QUALIFIED AS MITT ROMNEY IN MY OPINION BUT I LIKE HIM. I LIKE ALL THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. I THINK HE'S A GOOD MAN. I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH HIS POLICIES. GOOD MAN.
Reporter: WHAT WAS I DEALING WITH HERE? WHAT ABOUT THIS STYROFOAM CUP?
IT'S A GOOD CUP. IT HOLDS LIQUID. UNLESS IT'S GOT A HOLE IN IT WHICH I DON'T THINK IT DOES.
Reporter: WHO ARE YOU?
I'M JOE. A STRONG SUPPORTER OF MITT ROMNEY.
Reporter: YOU'RE VERY NICE.
WELL, THANK YOU. I TRY TO BE.
Reporter: NO ONE IS THAT POSITIVE. HAVE THEY BUGGED YOUR HOUSE?
NO. GOSH. NO. NO. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T THINK SO. NO.
