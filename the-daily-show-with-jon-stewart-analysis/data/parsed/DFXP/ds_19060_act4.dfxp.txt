[APPLAUSE] WE'RE BACK IN, SPEAKING WITH  ROBIN DOOLITTLE, A REPORTER FROM THE TORONTO STAR.   SHE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK, CRAZY  TOWN.   SHE HAS GOTTEN AN INCREDIBLE  AMOUNT OF ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS,  NOT EASY TO DO IN CANADA ABOUT  THIS REALLY AMAZING STORY THAT I THINK, AND MAYBE IT'S SORT OF  THE AMERICAN SENSE OF  PRUDISHNESS AND SHAME.   WE LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO  CREATE A TWO-DIMENSIONAL EFFIGY  OF A POLITICIAN OR PUBLIC FIGURE AND BURN IT AND USUALLY IN FRONT OF THEM.   THEN WE LIKE TO HAVE THEM ON AN  INTERVIEW SHOW SUCH AS THIS TO  SAY, LIKE WOW, THAT MUST HAVE  STUNG, LIKE THAT.   WHAT IS THE PROCESS?   WHAT IS CANADA'S DIGESTIVE  PROCESS FOR HOW THEY DESTROY  PEOPLE?   BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WE DO AS A  PART OF IT.
PART OF THE REASON BECAUSE  YOU ASKED ME EARLIER, HOW IS IT  THAT SOMETHING WASN'T DONE  EARLIER.   IN CANADA WE ARE MUCH LESS  COMFORTABLE WITH GETTING IN TO  PEOPLE'S PERSONAL LIVES.   SO WHEN I WAS WRITING THE BOOK I WAS REALLY TORN ABOUT INCLUDING  DETAILS ABOUT HIS SIBLINGS AND  HIS WIFE WHO ARE NOT ELECTED  OFFICIALS.   THAT IS THE PART OF THE STORY IS THAT TRULY CRAZY, THE SISTER,  SEVERAL OF, TWO SIBLINGS  STRUGGLED WITH HARD DRUG  ADDICTION.   HIS SISTER'S ESTRANGED HUSBAND,  MURDERED HER BOYFRIEND.
WHOA.
SHE WAS SHOT IN THE FACE BY  ANOTHER BOYFRIEND.
HIS SISTER WAS SHOT IN THE FACE.
WITH HER FATHER'S GUN.
SO THE FAMILY, THE BULLET.
THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER, THE  STORY OF THE FORD FAMILY IS  TOTALLY CRAZY.   I MEAN THE FATHER, FOR EXAMPLE,  THE DAD GREW UP IN THE GREAT  DEPRESSION, SELF-MADE  MILLIONAIRE, WORKED HIS BUTT OFF TO BUILD THIS LABEL COMPANY.   AND HE NEVER REALLY FELT  COMFORTABLE, THOUGH, WITHOUT A LOT  OF MONEY IN THE HOUSE STILL.   SO HE KEPT A COUPLE, 10,000  STUFFED IN A TIN CAN IN THE  BASEMENT.   WHEN IT WENT MISSING, HE HOOKED HIS KIDS UP TO A LIE DETECTOR  TEST TO SEE WHO STOLE IT. THESE ARE THE THINGS, WHILE ROB FORD IS AN INTERESTING  CHARACTER, THIS HELPS EXPLAIN  WHAT HAPPENED.   MAYBE I GOT SIDETRACKED THERE,  DIDN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.   IN GENERAL, ALL THESE DETAILS,  THEY'RE HARD TO PULL OUT IN  CANADIAN CULTURE BECAUSE THAT'S  THEIR PRIVATE BUSINESS.   I THINK, I HAVE TAKEN FLACK  ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK.
WHAT IS IT LIKE AS A PEOPLE,  AS A COUNTRY TO STILL HAVE A  CONSCIENCE?   WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE?   BECAUSE HERE WE, LIKE RIGHT NOW, IF ANTHONY WEINER GOD BLESS HIM  IS HOME WATCHING, I TOOK PICTURES OF MYSELF IN MY UNDERWEAR AND  I'M EXCORIATED.   WE HAVE ELLIOT SPITZER, BUT HE'S NOW LIKE THE TOXIC AVENGER.   HE DATED A WOMAN WHO WORKED FOR  THE MAYOR AND SHE HAD TO QUIT,  LIKE THAT'S HOW RIDICULOUS WE  ARE AS A COUNTRY AND A CULTURE.  BUT THAT BEING SAID, THIS MAN  APPEARS TO HAVE GONE BEYOND,  THERE'S A DARKNESS THERE THAT  THESE BOOKS, STORIES DON'T END  WELL.
IN CASE IT NEEDS SAYING, ROB  FORD IS UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT'S  EVER HAPPENED IN CANADA BEFORE.
WELL, BIEBER.
OKAY, POINT, MATCH.   I STILL HOLD OUT HOPE FOR JUSTIN BIEBER.   ANYWAY, BACK TO ROB FORD.
YOU KNOW, IF THEY STOOD  TOGETHER AT A REHAB CLINIC IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THE NUMBER 10.   TERRIBLE JOKE.
YEAH.
WHAT'S NICE, LOOK HOW  UNCOMFORTABLE YOU JUST GOT  BECAUSE --
A FAT JOKE.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID?   YOU HAD THE CORRECT RESPONSE.   YOU SEE WHAT THE AMERICANS DID?  THE AMERICANS ARE LIKE  THIS:AHHH, FAT GUY, SKINNY GUY,  EVEN AS I SAID IT, EVEN AS IT  WAS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH I  THOUGHT WOW, THAT WAS KIND OF A  DICKISH THING TO SAY, YOU WERE  LIKE THAT LITTLE TOUCH OF  HUMANITY THAT SHOULD STILL BE  LEFT IN ME.   ROBIN, STAY HERE AND HEAL US.   ALL THINGS ASIDE, WHY IS THERE NO  MECHANISM?   I KNOW THEY HAD A CITY COUNCIL  VOTE, WHY IS THERE NO MECHANISM  TO FORCE THIS PERSON TO, I JUST  FEEL LIKE IF YOU'RE A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND PEOPLE THINK YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ABUSE, THEY CAN  FORCE YOU.
I HAVE A NERDY ANSWER TO  THAT.
PLEASE.
SO THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO,  THE ONLY ENTITY THAT CAN REMOVE  ROB FORD.   THEY CAN GIVE OUR MUNICIPAL  GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY TO REMOVE HIM, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD REASONS WHY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT.   OUR PROVENCIAL GOVERNMENT IS A  LIBERAL GOVERNMENT.   BIG OPPONENTS OF ROB FORD BUT  LEFT AND RIGHT PEOPLE AREN'T  REALLY ON BOARD WITH THAT IDEA  AND THE REASON IS THAT IF YOU  CHANGE THE LAWS TO MAKE IT  EASIER FOR POLITICIANS TO OUST  OTHER POLITICIANS THIS EXTREME  CIRCUMSTANCE IS PROBABLY NOT  GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN, BUT YOU  MIGHT HAVE PEOPLE TRY TO REMOVE  PEOPLE FOR POLITICAL REASONS.   LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH BILL  CLINTON.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
OKAY.   SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY PEOPLE  ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM  WERE RELUCTANT TO CHANGE THE  MECHANISM SO CITY COUNCIL COULD  EASILY REMOVE ITS MAYOR IF IT  GOT IRRITATED WITH HIM.
WHAT IS YOUR MEDIA LIKE UP  THERE?   ARE THEY LIKE, ARE THEY CONFLICT BASED LIKE OURS?   I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NEWS  MEDIA.   OR DO THEY ALSO EXERCISE  RESTRAINT?
I TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE  BOOK.   VERY RECENTLY EVOLVING TO AN  AMERICAN-STYLE, THANK YOU,  AMERICA.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WHERE WE'RE SEEING LIKE TALK  RADIO, I TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK  HOW I THINK TALK RADIO  CONTRIBUTED TO THIS BECAUSE THE  FORDS, THERE'S TWO, A BROTHER AS WELL WHICH WE DIDN'T GET IN TO  BUT THAT'S IN THERE, WILL SAY  THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE AND LOOK IN THE CAMERAS AND YOU KIND OF  TALK ABOUT IT AS FACT.   THERE'S NOT THAT SORT OF PAUSE  OF FACT CHECKING.   AND WITH TALK RADIO THOSE ERRORS BECOME TRUE.
AMPLIFIED.
RIGHT.
THEN YOU CAN GET YOUR OWN  NEWS CHANNEL, DO THE WHOLE  THING, YEAH.
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN  ENTITY THAT THEY'RE CALLING FOX  NEWS NORTH, A RIGHT WING CHAIN  OF NEWSPAPERS STARTED A TV  STATION CALLED FOX NEWS, IT'S  GOING THAT WAY FOR BETTER OR  WORSE.
YOU'RE GOING TO START GOING  IN THE  [BLEEP] SOON. IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY CRIPPLING PHENOMENON THAT PARALYZES A COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO  ADDRESS ITS OWN PROBLEM WHICH IS THE STORY OF ROB FORD.
THEN WE WILL NEED A DAILY  SHOW TO POINT OUT THOSE  HYPOCRISIES.   [APPLAUSE]
CRAZY TOWN, ON BOOK SHELVES NOW, ROBIN DOOLITTLE! [APPLAUSE]
