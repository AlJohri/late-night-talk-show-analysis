Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE AS AMERICANS ARE OBVIOUSLY DOING OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN INHERIT A BANKRUPT AND  DYSFUNCTIONAL COUNTRY. BUT DID YOU KNOW THERE'S ONE THING EVEN MORE HARMFUL TO OUR CHILDREN THAN OUR  STEWARDSHIP OF THE WORLD? AASIF MANDVI FILED THIS EYE-OPENING REPORT.
ASBESTOS IN WILL SKOOS, LEAD PAINT IN TOYS, THESE HEALTH THREATS ARE WELL-KNOWN TO PARENTS. BUT NOW A HEALTH GROUP IS RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT SOMETHING EVEN MORE DANGEROUS.
HOT DOGS.
HOT DOGS.
HOT DOGS.
YOU MEAN LIKE THE HOT DOG WES BUY IN THE GROCERY STORE.
THEY ARE LINKED TO COLON CANCER.
REALLY?
YEAH.
DO YOU GIVE YOUR CHILD A HOT DOG EVERY DAY OR EVERY COUPLE DAYS YOU ARE  BASICALLY BUYING THEM A TICKET TO WIN A CANCER LOTTERY.
A HOT DOG IS A TICKET IN A CANCER LOTTERY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
THAT WAY NO ONE WINS THE LOTTERY.
I SHOULD MAKE A STRONGER ANALOGY.
BUT WHO NEEDS ANALOGIES WHEN YOU HAVE SCIENCE.
HERE ARE THE NUMBERS. IF A PERSON EATS A HOT DOG EVERY DAY ON AVERAGE THEIR RISK OF COLON CANCER IS  INCREASED BY MORE THAN 20%.
SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IF I EAT A HOT DOG EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR IT'S  BAD FOR ME?
YEAH.
AND EVEN THOUGH NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND ACTUALLY EATS A HOT DOG EVERY DAY T  DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE WARNED ABOUT IT SO HE TAKES THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP.
PICK UP THIS BILL BOARD, YOU SEE THAT HOT DOG STICKING OUT OF WHAT IS MEANT TO LOOK LIKE A CIGARETTE PACKAGE.
COMPARING HOT DOGS TO CIGARETTES WHICH ENRAGES MEAT LOBBYISTS LIKE THE  NATIONAL HOT DOG AND SAUSAGE COUNCIL.
EQUATING HOT DOGS TO CIGARETTES IS PROPOSE TRUSS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PACKAGE HOT DAG YOU HAVE A NUTRITION LABEL.
I AGREE HOT DOGS ARE NOT CIGARETTES BUT TO CALL THEM NUTRITIONAL IS PROBABLY  OVERSTATING THEM A LITTLE BIT.
ONE IS A FOOD, ONE IS AN ADDICTIVE DRUG.
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE ADDICTIVE.
HOT DOGS ARE ADDICTIVE?
YES.
SO AS WHAT, HEROIN?
OKAY, HOW I DO PUT THIS.
CRACK, CRACK COCAINE.
LESS THAN CRACK.
SO SOMEWHERE LIKE ON PAR WITH WATCHING THE WIRE.
PEOPLE SAY I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN GIVE UP MY-- THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
RIGHT, I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN GIVE UP WATCHING THE WIRE.
YEAH.
PEOPLE SAY THAT.
YEAH.
PEOPLE SAID THAT-- I SAY THAT.
AND NOT ONLY ARE HOT DOGS ADDICTIVE, THEY'RE AVAILABLE ON EVERY STREET CORNER, WHERE PUSHERS SELL THEM TO ADDICTS.
HERE IS YOU WHAT HAVE BEEN K5U8D.
OKAY.
DEATH MERCHANTS, WEANER SLINGER, THE BRAT WORST.
I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'M THE QUEEN OF WEAN.
THE WHAT.
THE QUEEN OF WEAN.
IT'S MY NICK NAME.
WHO GAVE YOU THAT NICK NAME.
I GAVE TO MYSELF.
YOU GAVE YOURSELF THE NICK NAME QUEEN OF WEAN.
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL HOT DOG AND SAUSAGE COUNCIL SO I GET TO DO  SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I KNEW SOMEBODY IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO HAD THE NICK NAME QUEEN OF WEAN.
I THOUGHT I WAS THE FIRST ONE.
AND THANKS TO LOBBY GROUPS LIKE THIS ONE, HOT DOGS ARE ACCEPTED. AND EVEN CELEBRATED ON TELEVISION.
THAT THROW POWER.
IT THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF USERS IS TO SCARE THEM STRAIGHT.
IF YOU EAT HOT DOGS YOU WILL BECOME AN ADDICT LIKE THIS GUY.
YEAH.
NO, NO NOT WHOA.
WHOA!
COOL.
OKAY, STOP, JUST STOP, STOP, STOP.
WE WERE LOSING THE BATTLE AGAINST HOT DOGS BUT TAKING A PAGE FROM ANTI-TOBACCO  CAMPAIGNS, VICTORY COULD BE ATTAINED THROUGH A GRATUITOUSLY SHOCKING STUNT.
HOT DOGS, HOT DOGS, HERE. HERE'S YOUR HOT DOGS. WHAT I CAN GET YOU.
YOU CAN GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE, PLEASE.
SURE.
YOU KNOW THAT HOT DOGS PROVIDE 0% OF YOUR DAILY INTAKE OF FRUIT. 100 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO EAT FOOD WILL DIE. YOU KNOW WHO PUTS WEANERS IN THEIR MOUTHS, DRUG ADDICTS. DO YOU KNOW IF YOU LINED UP ALL THE PEOPLE KILLED BY HOT DOGS, IT WOULD STRETCH  PROBABLY SOME DISTANCE TO THE SUN. WOULD YOU COME BACK. I'M NOT DONE SHOCKING YOU YET.
DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO GET A HOT DOG SMELL OUT OF A GRIM REAPER COSTUME?
