(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK.  MY GUEST TONIGHT, PULIZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "LIFE ANIMATED: A STORY OF SIDEKICKS, HEROES AND AUTISM." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM RON SUSKIND. RON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO, SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS CALLED "LIFE'S ANIMATED," IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY. YOU ARE MORE KNOWN, OBVIOUSLY, FOR IN-DEPTH JOURNALISM BOOKS. YOU WON A PULITZER, YOU WRITE ABOUT THE WASHINGTON CULTURE, THE THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL BOOK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.
YEAH. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO BRING THAT STORY OUT?
WELL YOU KNOW, OWEN, OUR SON, GOT TO KIND OF AN AGE OF AWARENESS ABOUT 19 AND HE SAID TO MY WIFE CORNELIA AND I, LOOK, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ME AND KNOW PEOPLE LIKE ME. AND HE'S LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE WRITERS, I SAID, "YEP," AND OFF WE WENT. AND YOU KNOW, AND PART OF IT IS WE SAID, WOULD THIS BOOK HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO US 15 YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE REALLY IN THE DARKNESS AND FEAR? I WE SAID, OF COURSE. SO.
NOW, WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT THAT IS SO OWEN IS YOUR SON.
YES. HE WAS DIAGNOSED AT 3 OR 3 1/2 WITH THE REGRESSIVE FORM OF AUTISM.
THAT'S RIGHT. RIGHT. SO BASICALLY, HE SEEMS LIKE A TYPICAL KID, I LOVE YOU, LET'S GET ICE CREAM, AND THEN THEY REGRESS. IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE REGULAR AUTISM.  IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE CASES ARE REGRESSIVE. SO, THE PROBLEM IS THEY FEEL LIKE, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE VANISHING IN FRONT OF YOU. THEY JUST DISAPPEAR.
RIGHT. OF COURSE, YOU SAY, WHAT HAPPENED? DID HE HURT HIMSELF? DID HE BANG HIS HEAD? AND THEN WE HEAR THE WORD "AUTISM."
AND HE HAS AT THIS POINT SOMEWHAT DISAPPEARED. YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH HIM, BUT SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT UNLOCKS THE MYSTERY OF IT.
YEAH, LIKE HE LOVED THE DISNEY ANIMATED MOVIES, EVERY KID DID. YOU KNOW, IN THAT PERIOD. LION KING, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, ALADDIN. SO, HE'S WATCHING AGAIN WITH A PECULIAR INTENSITY. HE'S NOT SPEAKING. HE'S SILENT AT THIS POINT, BUT YOU CAN SEE HIM REWINDING. AND AFTER A WHILE, WE HEAR JIBBERRISH. YOU KNOW, HE'S SAYING THINGS THAT EVENTUALLY WE REALIZE ARE LINES FROM THE MOVIE, AT WHICH POINT OUR LIFE BECOME INSANE. WE START SPEAKING IN DISNEY DIALOGUE, AND IF YOU THREW HIM A LINE, HE'D THROW YOU BACK THE NEXT LINE.
Jon: WOW.
IT WAS CRAZY.
THANK GOD IT WASN'T TARANTINO. I MEAN, I, JUST THE --  (LAUGHTER)
NONE OF IT WOULD HAVE WORKED, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IT.
THE PROFANITY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN YOUR HOUSE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AWFUL!
BUT WE WOULD HAVE GONE WITH TARANTINO IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
Jon: SO WHAT HE IS DOING, AND THIS IS I THINK THE KEY TO THIS THAT IS SO, IN MANY WAYS HEARTBREAKING BUT ALSO HOPEFUL ABOUT AUTISM, HE IS LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT.
THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S LOOKING TO CONNECT AND DOESN'T QUITE KNOW HOW.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, LOOK, WHAT WE FIND IS THAT THESE KIDS EMBRACE  WHAT WE CALL AFFINITIES. FOR HIM IT'S DISNEY,  SOME KIDS IT'S THOMAS THE TANK OR MAPS OR ANIME. THEY USE IT AS A TOOLKIT TO KINDA MAKE THEIR WAY OUT. NOW, FOR A LONG TIME WE SAID, CUT IT OFF. IT'S PERSEVERATIVE, IT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE, IT'S OBSESSIVE. NOW, WE'RE FINDING IT'S MORE PATHWAY, WE'RE FINDING OUT, THAN PRISON. GO IN THERE WITH THEM, DANCE IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN IF YOU HAVE TO. AND EVENTUALLY OWEN AND WE TOGETHER BUILD A KIND OF VEHICLE THAT HE NOW DRIVES OUT INTO THE WORLD.
Jon: AND THE INCREDIBLE THING IS, HE'S WATCHING THIS AND HE'S PICKING UP SOCIAL INTERACTION. HE'S STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THE INCREDIBLE STORY ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOUR SON WALTER, WHO IS THE OLDER BOY.
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, NOW, WALT'S A WILDLY INDEPENDENT KID, A LOT OF KIDS, BROTHER'S OF DISABLED FOLKS, VERY JUNIOR ADULTS. HE GETS A LITTLE EMOTIONAL ON ONE DAY A YEAR, HIS BIRTHDAY. WE DON'T REALLY NOTICE, MY WIFE AND I. OWEN WALKS IN AFTER WALT'S 9TH BIRTHDAY, OWEN'S 6 AND A HALF. HE'S SAYING VERY LITTLE AT THIS POINT AND HE SAYS, HEY, WALTER DOESN'T WANT TO GROW UP LIKE MOGLI OR PETER PAN. NOW, THAT WAS LIKE A THUNDERBOLT WENT THROUGH THE KITCHEN. AT WHICH POINT WE SAID, HE'S IN THERE! NOW HOW DO WE GET BACK IN. AND THAT WAS OUR STRUGGLE ACROSS A DECADE. HOW DO YOU GET BACK IN?
NOT ONLY IS HE IN THERE, HE'S MORE INSIGHTFUL THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S REALLY THE MESSAGE HERE. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN'T EXPRESS IT, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT THERE. YOU KNOW, THEY OFTEN LIVE VERY RICH LIVES INSIDE OF THERE. IF YOU CAN GET IN THERE WITH THEM, YOU CAN DISCOVER THAT.
RIGHT. THAT'S WHY, SO I WANTED TO SHOW, THIS IS A CLIP. SET THIS UP A LITTLE BIT.
YEAH, YEAH. SO, WHAT HE DOES IS HE DOES VOICES, AND THE WHOLE FAMILY DID VOICES AND HE USES THEM REALLY TO MAKE SENSE OF HIMSELF AND HIS PLACE IN THE WORLD AND HE FINDS THE SPECIAL SCENES FROM DISNEY. THERE'S 20, 30 OF THEM THAT HE REALLY USES ALMOST LIKE THERAPY BUT ALSO IDENTITY AND PERSONAL GROWTH.
RIGHT. OKAY. AND THIS IS,  SO THIS IS OWEN USING THAT.
YOU MUST TAKE YOUR PLACE IN THE SAGA OF LIFE.
HOW CAN I GO BACK? I'M NOT WHO I USED TO BE!
REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE! YOU ARE MY SON! AND THE ONE TRUE KING. REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE!
WHO ARE YOU, OWEN?
YOUR SON.
YOU BET. (APPLAUSE)
CRAZY. CRAZY. ALL RIGHT. SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO... (APPLAUSE) SO LET'S DO THIS. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT, THERE IS SOME REALLY INTERESTING AND EXCITING THINGS THAT YOU ARE STARTING TO DO AND THE SCIENTISTS ARE STARTING TO DO, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. STICK AROUND A LITTLE BIT. ON THE WEB WE'LL GO. "LIFE, ANIMATED." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. PHENOMENAL STORY. RON SUSKIND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
