WORLD NEWS H IN NEW YORK THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FRED GUTERL. HE'S THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ON WHETHER HUMANS MIGHT CAUSE THEIR OWN EXSTINGS. I VOTE YES. THERE'S BEEN A TON OF DEPRESSING DEVELOPMENT IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE AT CITIZENS UNITED WITH THE RISE OF SUPER-PAC. I DON'T THINK IMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH CAMPAIGN FINANCE IS QUITE AS SAD AS THIS ONE. IT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SITTING ALONE WITH HIS LAPTOP IN A ROOM WHERE PERHAPS TEDDY ROOSEVELT SAT WHEN DESIGNATING THE NATIONAL PARKS OR LINCOLN SAT EMANS PAIGHT THE SLAVES OR TAFT SAT EATING AN INCREDIBLY LARGE BOWL OF CHILI. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HISTORICALLY INACCURATE. WE ALL KNOW TAFT ATE WITH HIS HANDS. HE WAS AN ANIMAL. NO SPOON FOR HIM WHAT WAS OUR PRESIDENT DOING ALONE WITH HIS LAPTOP? DONATING TO HIS OWN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS KNOW THAT I'M NOT JUST TALKING THE TALK, I'M WALKING THE WALK. LAWYER, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND MY OCCUPATION IS PRESIDENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BIRTH PLACE -- [ LAUGHTER ] MR. PRESIDENT, DON'T DO IT. DON'T HIT THE DONATE BUTTON. DON'T GIVE YOU YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS. YOU'LL END UP SPAMMING THE LIVING (bleep) OUT OF YOU. HOW MUCH ACCESS ARE YOU BUYING, MR. PRESIDENT? ARE YOU GOING FOR THE $40,000 CLOONEY AND HANG? THE $30,000 DINNER AND FOO FIGHTERS CONCERT WITH YOU. YOU MIGHT MEET SJP.
THE PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN $5,000 TO HIS OWN REELECTION EFFORT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT WILL RUN YOU $10,000 JUST TO GET A PHOTO OP WITH YOURSELF. WHAT DO YOU GET FOR $5,000? YOU ONLY THING YOU GET FOR THAT? BIDEN SAYS YOUR FULL NAME IS A SINGLE BELCH. THAT'S IT. [BELCHING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S GOING TO COST HIM LATER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT? RAISING MONEY IS THE LEAST OF OWE BALM WHY'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE IS UP AGAINST AN OPPONENT NOT JUST WITH THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES BUT A COMPELLING PLAN.
THIS IS IT IM. IF YOU DON'T WANT AMERICA TO BE THE STRONGEST NATION ON EARTH, I'M NOT YOUR PRESIDENT.
Jon: SO, SO, WAIT F I DO WANT AMERICA TO BE THE STRONGEST COUNTRY ON EARTH THEN -- AH. IT'S VERY SIMPLE ACTUALLY. HERE IS HOW THE GOVERNOR WILL MAKE US THE STRONGEST. HERE IS HOW HE WILL ADDRESS IMMIGRATION REFORM.
BY VIRTUE OF MY PUTTING IN PLACE A LONG-TERM SOLUTION WHICH LEGISLATION THAT CREATES LAW THAT RELATES TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY. THAT'S NOT SOOCH AN IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN AS MUCH AS HOW THE STAR MAN WOULD DESCRIBE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HERE ON EARTH. WHAT WOULD BET SPECIFICS OF YOUR IMMIGRATION POLICY?
YOU WOULD LIKE TO -- I'M NOT GOING TO START DRAWING LINES HERE ABOUT WHO GETS TO STAY AND WHO GETS TO GO?
SURE, YOU DON'T WANT TO GET BOGGED DOWN NAMING NAMES. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW ABOUT TAXES?
WE CAN HAVE LOWER RATES AS I PROPOSED THAT CREATES MORE GROABLG AND LIMIT DEDUCTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
Jon: NOW THAT'S SPECIFIC WHICH DEDUCTIONS.
WHICH OF THE DEDUCTIONS ARE WILLING TO ELIMINATE? WHICH TAX CREDIT?
WE'LL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH CONGRESS.
Jon: OKAY, WELL THAT -- THAT'S NOT UNTIL AFTER YOU WOULD BE ELECTED S. DO YOU HAVE A TIME FRAME FOR YOUR ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS TO TAKE EFFECT?
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXACT TIME FRAME.
Jon: OH, UM, HOW ABOUT A RANGE? DO I HAVE TIME TO RUN TO THE BATHROOM OR WILL ANIMALS THAT ARE FISH NOW HAVE LEGS THEN? [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE YOUR PLATFORM SEEMS TO BE LISTEN, I HAVE A PLAN AND I CAN FIX THIS THING. DON'T WORRY YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEADS HEADS ABOUT IT. MITT ROMNEY, A TALENTED DETAIL ORIENTED C.E.O. HAS INTR SPARING WITH THE DETAILS OF AGENDA. WE KNOW MORE ABOUT BARACK. 'S SECRET AGENDA AND I KNOW WHY.
THE PRESIDENT LEAD ISING AND CONTINUES TO LEAD. 47% FOR THE PRESIDENT AND MITT ROMNEY 43%.
ONE RECENT POLL SHOWED THAT ANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WOULD BEAT PRESIDENT OBAMA BY 8 POINTS.
Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT HE IS DOING? MITT ROMNEY LOSING TO BARACK OBAMA BUT GENERIC REPUBLICAN CRUSHES BARACK OBAMA. CLEARLY HIS BEST OFFICE IS TO RUN AS A GENERIC REPUBLICAN. THE STORE BRAND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND AVOID PARTICULARS. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO. IT'S A SKILL.
DO YOU PERSONALLY THINK HOMOSEXUALITY IS SAY SIN?
NICE TRY.
IT'S A VALID QUESTION AND MY ANSWER IS NICE TRY.
Jon: NICE TRY (bleep). YOU THOUGHT I WOULD FALL FOR THE OLD ANSWER QUESTIONS ON AN INTERVIEW SHOW GRIFT. NOT ONLY DOES HE DODGE HOT BUTTON ISSUES HE DODGES NO BUTTON ISSUES. WHO IS THE LAST BOOK YOU READ OR ARE READ?
I'M READ AGE FUN ONE ON THAT SO I'LL SKIP THAT.
Jon: YOU ARE NOT GETTING ME ON THAT FUN BOOK I'M READING.   MUST BE 50 SHADES. -- OF GREY. NOT TO SELF. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T EXPRESS PREFERENCE FOR THINGS. I LOVE THE DECORATION OF INDEPENDENCE. I LOVE OUR CONSTITUTION. I LIKE ALL THE AMENDMENTS.
Jon: I KNOW A LOT OF YOU OUT THERE ARE LIKE REALLY EVEN THE 11TH? YOU BET! I LOVED PROHIBITION. I LOVED THE REPEAL OF IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
OF COURSE, THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER. I LOVE CARS. I LOVE AMERICAN CARS. I LOVE HUMOR. I LOVE OUR PEOPLE. I LOVE THE LAND. I LOVE THE LAKE. I DON'T LIKE VAM PIRES. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: REALLY? REALLY THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THAT LAST ONE. DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION I WAS FAVORING THE HUMANS OVER THE UNDEAD. THEY ARE PEOPLE TOO MY FRIENDS OR WERE. TAKING A FULLY FUNCTIONALLY 3-D HUMAN BEING AND REWORKING HIM TO A 2-DPABLUM FACTORY TAKES EFFORT.
I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO HAVE ASSAULT WEAPON AS THE PERSONAL ARS NELL.
Jon: TAKE THAT AND CONDENSITY.
I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS FOR WHATEVER LEGAL PURPOSE THEY HAVE IN MIND. SIMPLE ANSWER.
Jon: DONE AND DONE. I WILL COME OUT TODAY AND SAY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD DO ILLEGAL THINGS WITH WEAPONS. [ LAUGHTER ] NAILED IT. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKING THE GUY WAS PRETTY ROBOTIC AND COMBINED OF NONHUMAN TO BEING WIT. IT'S LIKE TAKING A KEN DOLL AND TURNING HIM INTO FLAT ROMNEY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I GUESS HAS ITS ADVANTAGES, I GUESS. IF YOU WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO IRAN, GET YOURSELF O NO NO, AH, HELP ME, HELP ME! FLIP OUT PRESIDENT ROMNEY INTO AN ENVELOPE PRETTY SOON AK DIN JAD -- AK AHMADINEJAD IS LIKE, OH, A LETTER FOR ME. PROBLEM SOLVED. WHAT KIND OF REPUBLICAN DO YOU GET TO ROUND OUT TICKET?
I WON'T CHARACTERIZE QUALIFICATIONS FOR VICE PRESIDENT.
Jon: OF COURSE YOU WON'T. I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT ONE TICKET. WE'LL
