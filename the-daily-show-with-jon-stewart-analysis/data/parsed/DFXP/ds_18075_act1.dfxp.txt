FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. THE FINE PROGRAM. MY GUEST MICHAEL MOSS HE IS THE  AUTHOR OF "SALT SUGAR FAT", THE  "EAT PRAY LOVE" OF DIABETES  ENTHUSIASTS. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY. WITH A DIFFICULT ELECTION LOSS  BEHIND THEM THERE'S A TIME OF  REFLECTION AND SOUL SEARCHING FOR THE G.O.P. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF THEY FIND  ONE! OH, OH, WHO WANTS A PIECE OF  THIS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHO WANTS A PIECE OF THIS? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] I KID, OF COURSE. REALLY? ALL RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] LAST WEEK THE REPUBLICAN  NATIONAL COMMITTEE RELEASED ITS  REPORT ON WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE 2012 ELECTION AND HOW THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY CAN REVERSE ITS  FORTUNES IN THE FUTURE.
OFFICIALS ARE CALLING IT AN  AUTOPSY.
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY ARE CALLING IT AN AUTOPSY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT IS A DOCUMENT OF  IDEALISTIC NAMED FOR BODIES IN  THE RIVER. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE RUB A LITTLE  CANCER UNDER OUR NOSES AND GET  TO THE BUSINESS OF CUTTING THIS BLOATED CORPSE OPEN. WE KNOW THE TIME OF DEATH. RNCRINCE PREEBOUS WHAT IS THE  CAUSE OF DEATH?
THE MESSAGE ISN'T RESONATING  ENOUGH. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT OUR MOMS  USED TO TELL US, IT'S NOT JUST  WHAT YOU SAY IT'S HOW WE SAY IT.
Jon: FOR INSTANCE,, THE WAY  I SAY IT IS LIKE A DRUNK MUPPET. OR AS DRUNK MUPPETS ARE KNOWN TO  THE POLICE DRUPPETS. A 100 PAGE REPORT TO REASSURE  REPUBLICANS THEY DON'T NEED TO  CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING BUT HOW THEY ARE SAYING IT. REMEMBER, WHEN YOU TELL A GAY  PERSON THAT THEIR LOVE IS TOO  UNNATURAL FOR SOCIETY TO RECOGNIZE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- SMILE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] A BIG ISSUE FOR 2012 WAS TO  CONNECT WITH MINORITIES. PLEASE WELCOME G.O.P. 2.0  RELATABLE STYLE.
WE'RE GOING TO OVERALL OUR  CAMPAIGN MECHANIC STRUCTURE TO  FULLY INTEGRATE THE DEMOGRAPHIC ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY. THIS NEW APPROACH WILL BE  DIVERSE, YEAR-ROUND,  COMMUNITY-BASED AND DEDICATED TO PERSON-TO-PERSON ENGAGEMENT. WE'LL CONDUCT A PILOT PROGRAM  AND TARGETED URBAN MARKETS TO  TESTED AND RE-- TO TEST AND REFINE THE ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THE LOCAL NATIVES SEEM  TO BE FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE  WITH MY PRESENCE. HOLY (bleep). LET ME BRAKE THIS STRATEGY DOWN,  IF I MAY. AFTER PRETENDING -- SETTLE DOWN. SETTLE DOWN IT'S A PUN. LET ME BREAK THIS STRATEGY DOWN. AFTER PRETENDING MINORITIES  DIDN'T EXIST THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY HAS DECIDED TO PHYSICALLY GO INTO THE AREAS AND ENGAGE  PERSON-TO-PERSON OR AS THAT IS  KNOWN ON THE STREETS, TALKING. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT OF COURSE AS THE SAYING  GOES, TALK IS NOT CHEAP.
WE'RE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING  A $10 MILLION INITIATIVE JUST  THIS YEAR IN WHICH IT WILL INCLUDE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE,  PAID, ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM  COAST TO COAST, IN HISPANIC, AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN  COMMUNITIES TALKING ABOUT OUR  PARTY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE WERE JUST GOING TO  PAY $5 MILLION BUT THESE ARE  MINORITY COMMUNITIES SO WE HAD TO SWEETEN THE POT. YOU UNDERSTAND. [LAUGHTER] THERE YOU GO YOU'LL GO TO  MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS, COULD  MARKET RESEARCH AND TAKE PEOPLE BACK TO THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES  WITH A RETARGETED MESSAGE. IT WORKS FOR COOL CIGARETTES. WHY NOT FOR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION  THAT HAS SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO  THE OVERALL HEALTH OF  MINORITIES. ALL RIGHT SO. NOW WE KNOW. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN APPLY THIS  NEW REMESSAGING STRATEGY TO LAST  WEEK'S OTHER MAJOR NEWS FROM THE RIGHT:  CPAC WHICH STANDS FOR  (bleep) PENIS AND (bleep). NO, SORRY THAT'S -- [LAUGHTER] THAT'S ON CRAIGSLIST THAT'S WHAT  IT STANDS FOR. I BELIEVE IN THIS CONTEXT IT  STANDS FOR CONSERVATIVE  POLITICAL ACTION CONFERENCE. IT'S NOT THE IDEAS BUT THE WAY  THEY ARE SAYING THEM.
WHY AREN'T WE LETTING PEOPLE  IN FROM EUROPE? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: TALKING ABOUT EUROPE. WHY NOT LET PEOPLE IN FROM  EUROPE? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUALITY  IMMIGRANTS NOT THESE SPANISH  SPEAKING PRICKS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? THE WHITE ONES FROM SPAIN. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN TAPAS AND TACOS. CLASS, YES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO ELSE NEEDS A MESSAGE  MASSAGE.
A NEW BOOK IS OUT TALKING  ABOUT THE PERKS IN EXCESS OF THE  $1.4 BILLION A YEAR PRESIDENCY WE'RE PAYING FOR. THERE ARE FIVE CHEFS ON AIR  FORCE ONE. THERE ARE TWO PROJECTISTS WHO  OPERATE THE WHITE HOUSE MOVIE  THEATER. WE'RE ALSO THE ONES WHO ARE  PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO WALK THE  PRESIDENT'S DOG.
Jon: THEY MAKES A GOOD  POINT THAT IS A SHARP INDICTMENT  OF THE PRESIDENT'S WASTEFUL  LIFESTYLE.
CONGRESSWOMAN BACHMANN GOT  HER INFORMATION FROM A BOOK FROM  A LONGTIME REPUBLICAN LOBBYIST. THE BOOK PROVIDES NO SPECIFIC  SOURCES FOR THE CLAIMS IT MAKES.
Jon: HERE IS THE  OPPORTUNITY. RATHER THAN SEEMING LIKE ON OUT TOUCH PA  INFORMATION FROM DUBIOUS SOURCES  GRACIOUSLY ADMIT YOUR WRONG ASSERTIONS AND GET SOME  CREDIBILITY BACK. OR R UUUN.
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DOG  WALKER WHICH IS NOT TRUE.
THE BIG POINT OF SPEECH WAS  ABOUT BENGHAZI.
BUT YOU ALSO MADE ACCUSATIONS  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT SPENDING  MONEY THAT OTHER PRESIDENTS ALSO  MADE.
Jon: MUST KEEP RUNNING. FACT CHECKING UP TO ME. MUST OUTRUN FACTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LISTEN -- SETTLE DOWN. WHAT IS NEXT?
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK AT  CPAC. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SURE Y NOT.
NO BACKGROUND CHECKS. I LIKE THE IDEA, MR. PRESIDENT,  SHOULD HAVE STARTED WITH YOURS.
Jon: I THINK I FINALLY  FIGURED OUT WHERE SARAH PALIN  CAME FROM, SOMEONE CAST A SPELL ON A YOUTUBE COMMENT AND IT CAME  TO LIFE. DOESN'T THE G.O.P. HAVE SOMEONE  WITH IDEAS WORTH MESSAGING? THEY NEED A FRESH VOICE, THAT  CAN BE THE FACE OF A DIVERSE  REPUBLICAN PARTY.
IS SPAIN'S NEUROSURGEON DR. BEN CARSON THE BLACK  CONSERVATIVE WHO CAN SAVE THE  G.O.P.
A REMARKABLE HUMAN BEING, A  GIFTED NEUROSURGEON, A WONDERFUL  LIFE STORY, TREMENDOUS VALUES, LOVES AMERICA.
Jon: ALL THAT AND HE'S A  DOCTOR? HERE WE GO. YOUR PARTY IS SO SCREWED UP IT'S  GOING TO TAKE A LITERAL BRAIN  SURGEON TO HELP FIGURE IT OUT PHYSICAL IT IS IN FACT THE WAY  YOUR MESSAGE IS FRAMED THAT THAT  IS THE PROBLEM, YOU CANNOT FIND A MORE APPEALING DELIVERY SYSTEM  THAN THIS MAN. LET'S DO THIS.
THAT HAS BEEN THE NATURE OF  AMERICANS. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN GENEROUS. NOBODY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOBODY IS STARVING ON THE  STREETS. WE'VE ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF THEM.
Jon: GOOD LUCK IN 2020. WE'LL BE RIGHT
