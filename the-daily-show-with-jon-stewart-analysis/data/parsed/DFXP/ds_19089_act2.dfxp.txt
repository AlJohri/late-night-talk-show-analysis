Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS WE SAW IN THE FIRST ACT THE WORLD AROUND US IS FALLING APART. [LAUGHTER] BUT LET'S BE HONEST, WE HAVE SOME OF OUR OWN PROBLEMS RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA.
EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS PACK THEIR BAGS. THEY HEAD TO THE BEACH AND BEACH DESTINATIONS FOR THE MOST COVETED WEEK OF THE YEAR. THAT'S SPRING BREAK.
WE CONTINUE TO EXPOSE WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON IN SPRING BREAK IN AMERICA.
Jon: YES, AMERICA'S OLDEST HALL MONITOR, SEAN HANNITY, DEDICATED NOT ONE, NOT TWO BUT FIVE DIFFERENT SHOWS ON THE HORRORS OF SPRING BREAK INCLUDING THE ENTIRE HOUR ON FRIDAY FEATURING A PANEL OF OUTRAGED EXPERTS THERE TO EXPOSE THIS ANNUAL EVENT. YOU WILL BELIEVE WHAT THEY FOUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
YES, PEOPLE HAVING SEX ON THE BEACH IN PUBLIC.
THE ABUNDANCE OF THE OVERDRINKING.
THESE YOUNG LADIES WHO ARE DISGRACING THEMSELVES BY RUNNING AROUND ACTING LIKE THAT.
WOMEN TAKE THEIR TOPS OFF.
THE YOUNG GIRL ON THE BOX WITH NO BOTTOM ON.
THESE SLOPPY DRUNKEN DUDES DOWN THERE.
GUYS WERE LITERALLY TAKING THEIR PANTS OFF.
YES. WAS HIGH AS A KITE.
LOTS OF DRINKING, DRUGS, RISKY BEHAVIOR SOMETIMES WITH TRAGIC RESULTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SHORTLY AFTER FILMING THAT PIECE THAT YOUNG WOMAN BLEW OUT HER LEFT BUTT CHEEK. [ LAUGHTER ] DOCTORS SAY SHE MAY NEVER TWERK AGAIN. PERHAPS SHE'LL HAVE TO FILE FOR TWERKMAN'S COMP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO YOU DID A WEEK OF SHOWS ON THIS. WHAT WISDOM DID THE PANEL IMPART?
MY DAUGHTER THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL SHE'S GOING THERE.
Jon: WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE. I ASSUME THE SAME GOES FOR YOUR SONS.
BUT WITH MY SONS I HOPE THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME.
MEN AND WOMEN ARE EQUAL BUT WE'RE DIFFERENT. IF I HAD A COLLEGE SON I WOULD SAY HERE IS $100, HAVE FUN.
Jon: LET'S JUST ALL AGREE THAT THAT IS SEXIST AND MOVE ON TO THE MORE PRESSING ISSUE HERE. $100? [LAUGHTER] HE'S GOING TO SPRING BREAK NOT DAVE AND BUSTERS. LOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE GOING TO GET A CALL THREE HOURS INTO SPRING BREAK "HEY, THANKS FOR $100. IT GOT ME TO DELAWARE." [LAUGHTER] NOW I'M JUST SITTING HERE BLOWING TRUCKERS TRYING TO GET DOWN TO TAMPA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO TO GET HOME. TELL MOM I LOVE HER. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW SOME OF THE MORE SKEPTICAL VIEWERS MIGHT THINK THIS IS LESS OF A NEWS STORY AND MORE OF A REASON TO SPEND A WEEK RUNNING WILDLY INAPPROPRIATELY T AND A FOOTAGE ALONGSIDE PUNDITS TSSKING SAID FOOTAGE. BUT YOU WOULD ONLY BE 99.9% RIGHT. YOU SEE, THIS IS AN IN-DEPTH CAUTIONARY TALE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN CHILDREN ARE NOT PROPERLY RAISED.
WHERE ARE THEIR PARENTS, IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW?
PARENTS TODAY REALLY NEED TO GET A GRIP ON WHAT GOING IS ON.
IT'S UP TO THE PARENTS PARENTS TO INSTRUCT THE KIDS.
IT'S TIME FOR PARENTS TO START PARENTING.
IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO PARENTS.
Jon: WHERE ARE THEIR PARENTS? [LAUGHTER] WHAT KIND OF ROTTEN NEGLECTFUL PARENTS WOULD ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO EVEN GO ON SPRING BREAK?
ONE TIME I WENT TO CANCUN IN COLLEGE.
I WENT TO ACAPULCO AND I WENT TO SOUTH BEACH.
I WENT TO AUBURN UNIVERSITY IN THE SOUTH AND SPRING BREAK WAS HUGE FOR ALL OF US.
I WENT TO SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY. IT WAS A PART SCHOOL. I HAD A GREAT TIME. I WENT ON SPRING BREAK.
I WENT TO PANAMA CITY IN 1992. I WAS AT SHARKIES. I MAY HAVE GOTTEN OVERSERVED ONE OR TWO NIGHTS.
I'VE BEEN DOWN THERE.
YOU KNOW ALL THOSE PLACES.
I KNOW ALL THOSE PLACES.
Jon: YOU DO. SO WHAT KIND OF (bleep) PARENTS LET THEIR KID GO TO SPRING BREAK? OH, RIGHT YOUR (bleep) PARENTS. SO YOU JUST DON'T WANT KIDS TODAY --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- YOU CLEARLY DON'T WANT KIDS TODAY DOING THE TERRIBLE THINGS YOU HAVE SUCH FOND MEMORIES OF DOING. I GUESS IF THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT, THERE'S ONE THING YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO KNOW, THEY ARE DOING IT WRONG.
WHAT WE USED TO DO WHEN WE WERE YOUNG PUT A BOOM HOLE, HOLD IT UP, OPEN IT UP AND THAT WAS CALLING SHOTGUN.
SHOOT THAT CUP.
THIS IS CALLED, GO AHEAD --
-- A FUNNEL.
THEY HAVE TO LEAN BACK. IT OPENS UP THEIR THROAT. AND THE BEER LITERLLY JUST GOES DOWN.
CHLOE!
THAT'S JUST WATER.
YOU HAVE TO BEND YOUR KNEES A LITTLE BIT. THAT'S THE WHOLE TRICK.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH BEND YOUR KNEES A LITTLE BIT. YEAH, YEAH. SHOW THEM HOW TERRIBLE IT IS. [ LAUGHTER ] HONESTLY IT'S THE (bleep) WEIRDEST WEEK OF TV I'VE EVER SEEN. PERHAPS AS ALWAYS THE BEST ADVICE ON STAYING SAFE CAME FROM FOX NEWS LIBERAL ROBERT BECKEL.
I USE A LOT OF COCAINE IN MY LIFE. I HAVE HAD GOOD COCAINE AND BAD COCAINE. I GUARANTEE YOU THE STUFF THEY'RE SELLING DOWN HERE IS BAD.
Jon: SO REMEMBER KIDS STAY IN SCHOOL, GET BETTER PARENTS, AND DON'T GO TO SPRING BREAK. BUT IF YOU DO, BRING YOUR COCAINE FROM HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH:  WHEN YOU GO ON SPRING BREAK, BRING THE COCAINE YOU USE AT HOME. [ LAUGHTER ] THE COCAINE YOU TRUST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT'S THE MORE YOU DO BLOW [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
