[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TODAY, OF COURSE, IN SOUTH AFRICA IT WAS THE MEMORIAL CEREMONY FOR NELSON MANDELA. IT WAS JOYFUL AT TIMES. THERE WAS SINGING. THERE WAS DANCING THERE WAS LESTER HOLT APPARENTLY REPORTING FROM THE 1940'S. [ LAUGHTER ] NO ONE HAD THE HEART TO TELL HIM HE WAS ACTUALLY JUST SPEAKING INTO A JUDGE'S GAVEL. ROOKIE MISTAKE. ONE THING IS FOR CERTAIN. THE PASSING OF NELSON MANDELA LEFT A MESSAGE FOR THE WORLD THAT NO ACT IS TOO PETTY FOR AMERICA'S NEWS MEDIA TO BLOW COMPLETELY OUT OF PROPORTION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOOK HANDS WITH THE CUBAN PRESIDENT RAUL CASTRO. IS THAT A BIG DEAL?
THE HANDSHAKE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD.
A HANDSHAKE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND RAUL CASTRO RAISING EYEBROWS, RAISES QUESTIONS AS WELL.
Jon: FROM ONLY YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] BARACK OBAMA AT A MEMORIAL CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF NELSON MANDELA, A MAN WHOSE LEGACY IS THAT HE FORGAVE AND EMBRACED HIS FOES AND TORMENTERS AND THUS INSPIRED HIS COUNTY TO A NATIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC REBIRTH. ATTENDING THAT OBAMA HAD THE AUDACITY TO GREET ANOTHER WORLD LEADER WITH A GESTURE SO MEANINGLESS YOU CAN TRAIN A BASSET HOUND TO DO IT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT THE (bleep) IS WRONG WITH US? [LAUGHTER] CAN SOMEONE BRING SOME PERSPECTIVE TO THIS AND BY BRING I MEAN LOSE?
WHY SHOULD YOU SHAKE HANDS WITHHY SHOULD YOU SHAKE HANDS SOMEBODY WHO IS KEEPING AMERICANS IN PRISON? I MEAN, WHAT IS THE POINT? NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN SHOOK HANDS WITH HITLER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DO I NEED ONCE AGAIN FROM THE HILLTOPS -- [TO THE SOUND OF MUSIC "THE HILLS ARE ALIVE"] ♪ RAUL CASTRO IS NOT ADOLF HITLER ♪ [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RAUL CASTRO ISN'T EVEN FIDEL CASTRO. HE'S LIKE CUBA'S JIM BELUSHI. HE'S GOOD BUT HE AIN'T JOHN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND BY THE WAY, CUBA IS NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH A SPOTTYT THE RECORD OF IMPRISONING PEOPLE IN CUBA. [ LAUGHTER ] AND SPEAKING OF HANDSHAKES WITH QUESTIONABLE LEADERS SENATOR McCAIN, LET HE WHO IS WITHOUT SIN CAST THE FIRST PURELL WIPE. OH IS THAT YOU SHAKING HANDS WITH QADDAFI? TURNS OUT THE FUNNY MACHINE MAKING THE CLICKING SOUND  WAS A CAMERA. WHAT MORE FITTING TRIBUTE COULD THERE BE TO NELSON MANDELA, A MAN SO DEDICATED TO FORGIVENESS HE INVITED HIS OWN CAPTOR TO HIS INAUGURATION THAN FOR OUR COUNTY TO LOSE OUR (bleep) OVER A HANDSHAKE. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO DO AT A FUNERAL OH, YEAH, HOW ARE YOU DOING? BOOP.? [LAUGHTER] I KNOW OBAMA IS NOT ALLOWED TO GO BOOM BECAUSE IT'S A TERRORIST FIST THE POINT IS, THE PRESIDENT BEHAVED HIMSELF JUST FINE.
LOOK AT THIS THE PRIME MINISTER, THE DANISH PRIME MINISTER AND PRESIDENT OBAMA LEANING IN TO TAKE A SELFIE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THAT'S KIND OF (bleep). WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
