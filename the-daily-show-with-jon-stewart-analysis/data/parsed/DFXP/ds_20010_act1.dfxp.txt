FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ZACH GALIFIANAKIS WILL BE JOINING US. BUT THE REAL EXCITING NEWS IS PRADEEP IS HERE. SHE MADE IT TO THE SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HAD A GENTLEMAN IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WAS WITH HIS WIFE OF 25 YEARS THAT CAME TO THE SHOW. WE ONLY HAD ONE TICKET WAS LEFT. AND I BELIEVE, HERE'S MY IMPRESSION OF HIM AT THE TIME. HA, I DON'T KNOW HER! NOW THEY'RE BOTH HERE TOGETHER. WE HAVE SAVED THEIR RELATIONSHIP. AND WELL, I'M JUST DAMNED HAPPY. BUT -- FIRST IT'S TIME FOR A DAILY SHOW EBOLA UPDATE. BROUGHT TO YOU BY ARBYS. ARBYS. SEE? A LOT OF THINGS CAUSE DIARRHEA. [LAUGHING] WE -- NO THAT'S, THERE'S REALLY NO REASON FOR THAT. ALL THEY DO IS SEND US PLATTERS OF FOOD. THEY ARE THE LOVELIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THERE'S JUST NO REASON FOR US DOING THIS. BUT LET'S BEGIN IN DALLAS WHERE A NURSE AT TEXAS HEALTH PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL HAS CONTACTED EBOLA FROM A WEST AFRICAN PATIENT.
THIS MORNING THIS QUAINT DALLAS COMMUNITY IS ON HIGH ALERT AFTER NEIGHBORS LEARNED THEY'RE NOW LIVING IN A POSSIBLE DANGER ZONE.
Jon: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. CLEANING GUYS? YOU'RE DECONTAMINATING A HIGH ALERT EBOLA DANGER ZONE AND YOU WENT WITH THE CLEANING GUYS. WHAT HAPPENED? WERE BROS WITH A HOSE NOT AVAILABLE? WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE? ALRIGHT, I SHOULDN'T WORRY. YOU KNOW, AFTER ALL, LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE A THOROUGHLY PROFESSIONAL OPERATION. AND THEN THERE'S, OH HOLY [BLEEP]. LOOK OUT, THERE WAS A HAIR PIN TURN, YOU TRIED TO SLOW DOWN! BUT I COULDN'T -- THERE GOES THE EBOLA ALL OVER -- [LAUGHING] NOW AS OF NOW THE NURSE WHO CONTACTED THIS RARE DISEASE AFTER VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE ONLY KNOWN WEST AFRICAN CARRIER OF THAT DISEASE IN OUR COUNTRY IS STABLE AND DOING "WELL." THAT'S FROM HER. OR TO PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY.
ANOTHER CASE OF EBOLA IN AMERICA.
A NEW CASE OF BOWLA.
A TEXAS HEALTHCARE WORKER DOES HAVE EBOLA.
SHOCKING HOSPITAL OFFICIALS.
FEARS THAT EBOLA COULD SPREAD.
WELL, NOW I'M SCARED AGAIN.
THE CDC STILL DOESN'T KNOW THE POINT OF CONTACT.
THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS HOW DID SHE GET IT?
HOW DID SHE GET IT?
HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLY CONTRACT EBOLA?
Jon: WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? [LAUGHING] SHE WAS A NURSE. IN THE EBOLA UNIT, SHE TOOK CARE OF THE EBOLA MAN. [LAUGHING] WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID SHE GET -- WAS IT A ZOLTAR WISH GONE AWRY? WAS SHE AT AN EBOLA KEY PARTY. DID SHE PEE IN A FOUNTAIN NEXT TO EBOLA? FOR GOD'S SAKE. AND THEN THEY CHANGE -- [LAUGHING] THAT'S A SIX FOOT TALL CASE OF EBOLA. ALRIGHT, SO, WE CAN'T COUNT ON THE NEWS MEDIA TO TAKE A REASONED APPROACH. SURELY, SURELY THEIR GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT WON'T LET US DOWN.
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 48 PEOPLE STILL UNDER CLOSE WATCH WHO WERE EXPOSED TO DUNCAN BEFORE HE WAS ISOLATED.
Jon: ALRIGHT. WELL, SIR, THE BAD NEWS YOU HAVE EBOLA, THE GOOD NEWS IS YOU HAVE A 30-FOOT PENIS. IT'S RED. ANYWAYS, OF COURSE, THE DISEASE MAY POSSIBLY SPREAD FROM THERE AS THE LATEST VICTIM HAS INTIMATE CONTACT WITH OTHERS. FOR GOD'S SAKES! OH MY GOD! IT'S WHAT RICK SANTORUM ALWAYS WARNED US ABOUT. ONCE WE SANCTIONED GAY MARRIAGE NOW MEN ARE GIVING DOGS EBOLA IN THEIR BUTTS. I REALLY FEEL LIKE ALL OF THESE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD JUST HIRE A NINE-YEAR-OLD TO SIT IN THE CONTROL ROOM AND GO THAT LOOKS LIKE A PENIS IN THE BUTT. CLEARLY THE NEWS ANCHOR IS HAVING TROUBLE DRAWING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A PERSON CONTRACTING THE DISEASE AFTER WORKING IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH AN EBOLA PATIENT AND THE INEVITABILITY ALL OF US GETTING IT NOW. RUN! I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, THERE HAVE BEEN EXPERTS ON YOUR OWN CHANNELS TELLING YOU THAT THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO BE QUITE CLOSE AND IN QUITE INTENSE CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY TO CATCH IT.
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO CATCH EBOLA. IT'S RELATIVELY HARD TO SPREAD.
IT CAN ONLY BE PASSED ON THROUGH BODILY FLUIDS LIKE BLOOD.
THE REALITY IS WE'RE JUST HEARING ABOUT ISOLATED CASES. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE ARE CLUSTERS OF PEOPLE COMING UP.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU KNOW? YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST. SCIENTISTS HAVE CRAZY HAIR AND MUSTACHES AND WEAR GLASSES AND LAB COATS. AND THEY'RE SO BUSY AND ABSENT-MINDED THEY'LL JUST PUT ANY OLD TIE ON.  COULD BE A BOW TIE FOR ALL I KNOW. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY'RE ALWAYS THINKING WITH THE -- THOSE GUYS, IF THOSE GUYS SAY IT'S OKAY -- FIND ME ONE OF THOSE GUYS!
IT'S REALLY NOT GREAT CAUSE FOR CONCERN. IT'S ALSO NOT VERY EASY TO TRANSMIT. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING]
Jon: TOUCHE. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE FLUBBER -- THESE - THESE EXPERTS ARE SO BORING. ISN'T THERE SOMEONE WHO IS TECHNICALLY A DOCTOR BUT WILL VALIDATE OUR HYSTERIA.
MY NEXT GUEST WROTE A PROPHETIC BOOK ON EBOLA WAY BACK IN 1987. ROBIN COOK'S BESTSELLING THRILLER "OUTBREAK" IS A FICTIONAL VERSION OF AN EBOLA OUTBREAK IN AMERICA.
Jon: THAT WAS FICTION. BUT FIRST THIS WEATHER REPORT FROM THE WRITER OF "SHARKNADO." SO WE'VE HEARD FROM EXPERTS WHO SAY THIS IS A DANGEROUS BUT MANAGEABLE SITUATION. NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITE OF AN EXPERT. A CONGRESSMAN.
WE ARE ONCE AGAIN ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO REESTABLISH A VIEW POINT ABOUT STOPPING THESE FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED STATES, DALLAS, TEXAS, IS REELING FROM THIS PROBLEM. THAT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED WHERE IT IS, IN AFRICA.
Jon: THAT'S CONGRESSMAN PETE SESSIONS, A REPUBLICAN FROM TEXAS SUGGESTING WE CLOSE AFRICA'S DOOR AND HOPE WHEN IT COMES OUT HOWEVER MANY WEEKS LATER IT FEELS BETTER. BUT HE MAKES A VALID IF HEARTLESS POINT. WHY NOT JUST STOP LETTING PEOPLE FROM AFRICA FLY TO HERE?
IF PEOPLE CAN'T LEAVE THE COUNTRY BY AIR AND PEOPLE ARE SICK. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? THEY'RE GOING TO START GOING INTO OTHER COUNTRIES BY LAND. THEY'RE GOING TO BE HARDER TO TRACE. CONTRACT TRACE. WHICH WE KNOW IS THE TRIED AND TRUE WAY OF STEMMING AN OUTBREAK.
Jon: OH RIGHT. QUARANTINING ALL OF WEST AFRICA WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE. WHICH TO BE FAIR TO CONGRESS IS WHAT THEY'RE ACCUSTOMED TO DOING.
I'M A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM DALLAS, TEXAS, AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND MY JOB IS TO SPEAK FOR AND TO HELP PROTECT AMERICANS.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS CALLOUS. BUT THE VOTERS OF DALLAS DID ELECT HIM ON THE SLOGAN, SESSIONS FOR CONGRESS, [BEEP] ALL Y'ALL. [LAUGHING] BUT AGAIN CONGRESSMAN, PERHAPS YOU WEREN'T LISTENING. SANJAY GUPTA SAID THAT THAT WOULD NOT PROTECT AMERICANS. IT WOULD INCREASE THE RAGING EPIDEMIC IN AFRICA AND MAKE IT HARDER TO TRACK THEM. IT WOULD MAKE IT WORSE. OH, MY GOD. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? CONGRESSMAN SESSIONS IS CARRYING A DANGEROUSLY MUTATED SANITY RESISTANT STRAIN OF FEAR THAT HAS GONE AIRBORNE. BUT PERHAPS HE'S RIGHT. ARE THERE OTHER REGIONS SUFFERING FROM DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND POOR MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT AMERICA SHOULD SHIELD ITSELF FROM?
TEXAS HAS THE MOST NUMBER OF UNINSURED AMERICANS IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
IN TEXAS MORE THAN 32,000 PARENTS OPTED OUT OF AT LEAST ONE VACCINE.
TEXAS REFUSED THE MEDICADE EXPANSION, TURNING AWAY $100 BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS.
THE FLU OUT BREAK IN TEXAS.
A MEASLES OUTBREAK IN TEXAS.
2,000 PEOPLE IN TEXAS HAD WHOOPING COUGH.
IT'S AN EPIDEMIC IN TEXAS. [LAUGHING]
Jon: ALRIGHT, TEXAS, HERE'S THE DEAL. WE CAN BUILD THAT BORDER FENCE YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED. WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO IT A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
