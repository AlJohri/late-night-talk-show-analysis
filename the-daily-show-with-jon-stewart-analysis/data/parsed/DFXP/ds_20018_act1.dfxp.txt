Jon: WELCOME TO A SPECIAL LIVE ELECTION NIGHT EDITION OF THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT, THE 2014 MIDTERM RESULTS  A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. AND BY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE, I MEAN THE SENATE. CHANCES ARE -- WELL LET'S FACE FACTS, DEMOCRATS ARE ABOUT TO LOSE THE GOOD SENATE RESTROOMS. (LAUGHTER) LATER ON, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REINCE PRIEBUS ON THE SHOW, HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE. HE WILL BE GIDDY. I PREDICT THIS INTERVIEW WILL BE THE WORST PART OF THE GREATEST NIGHT OF HIS LIFE. BUT MAN, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, (LAUGHTER) I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCH GAME OF THRONES, BUT IT IS A RED WEDDING OUT THERE. IT IS A BLOOD BATH BEYOND ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. BUT I WANTED TO ADDRESS SOMETHING FIRST. SOMETHING HAPPENED, I WAS OVER AT CNN TODAY. I SAID SOMETHING ON THE AIR AND IT CREATED A BIT OF A STIR. I WANTED TO GET TO IT. I WAS ON CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR'S SHOW ON CNN AND I SAID THIS --
DID YOU VOTE?
Jon: NO. NO. I JUST MOVED. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE MY THING IS NOW. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING... FIRST OF ALL. I'VE KNOWN WHERE MY THING IS SINCE I WAS 13. (LAUGHTER) BUT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. I DID VOTE TODAY. I DID KNOW WHERE MY BOOTH WAS. I WAS BEING FLIP AND IT KIND OF TOOK OFF AND, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FLIP ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK I WASN'T CLEAR ENOUGH I WAS KIDDING AND IT SENT A MESSAGE THAT I DIDN'T THINK VOTING WAS IMPORTANT OR THAT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS A BIG ISSUE, AND I DO, AND I DID VOTE AND I WAS BEING FLIP AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. THAT WAS STUPID. SO I APOLOGIZE. AND YEAH, THAT'S IT. (APPLAUSE) ANYWAY. NOW, I WANT TO GET TO SOME RESULTS. FIRST OF ALL, I'M GOING TO START A LITTLE BIT LOCAL HERE. AS YOU KNOW, IN NEW YORK, GOVERNOR CUOMO WAS RUNNING FOR REELECTION AND HE WON EIGHT WEEKS AGO, BUT I THOUGHT WE WOULD ANNOUNCE IT TONIGHT. IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE CLOSER THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE, 59% TO 39%. ALSO IN JERSEY, SOMETHING THAT WAS SORT OF A FAIT ACCOMPLI CENTER, CORY BOOKER DEFEATED JEFF BELL. AND HERE'S THE THING, (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED. BOOKER WASN'T AROUND TO MAKE A VICTORY SPEECH. HE WAS APPARENTLY BURNING SOMEBODY FROM A BURNING CAR WHILE TWEETING. (LAUGHTER) HE'S A VERY SPECIAL MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING AS A SENATOR. BUT AS A SUPERHERO, HE'S REALLY QUITE GOOD. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING. IN KENTUCKY, ALISON LUNDERGAN GRIMES WAS GOING UP AGAINST A SMALL, SMALL-MOVING REPTILIAN FIGURE. (LAUGHTER) HE'D BEEN IN THE SENATE. HE'S 220 YEARS OLD AS MANY TORTOISES ARE. AND HE WAS UP AGAINST HER. EVERYONE WAS SAYING IT'S NECK AND NECK. HERE ARE THE REAL RESULTS, GRIMES VS. MCCONNELL. HE ABSOLUTELY, HE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED HER. AND IF I MAY QUOTE MITCH McCONNELL TONIGHT -- SLOW AND STEADY... AAAA-YUP! (LAUGHTER) SO HE WILL BE THE NEW SENATE MAJORITY LEADER AND I PERSONALLY ASKED SOMEONE WHO TRULY ENJOYS DOING THE VOICE, I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED. AND ON THAT SAME NOTE, IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS THE CAROLINA EVEN NORTH CAROLINA DOESN'T LIKE TO ASSOCIATE WITH, BRAD HUTTO WAS RUNNING AGAINST SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. GRAHAM ABSOLUTELY FLATTENED THIS CAT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. OH, MY GOSH! HE WON BY SO MUCH HE FAINTED! LINDSEY GRAHAM GIVING HIMSELF THE VAPORS TONIGHT. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, I'M TRYING TO FIND ANY WAY TO ENTERTAIN PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY ON A LEDGE TONIGHT. THESE PEOPLE, EVERY QUESTION IN WARM UP, WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW? AS THOUGH THE SENATE WAS A FUNCTIONING BODY BEFORE TONIGHT. BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING HOW WILL I KNOW IF THE SENATE CHANGES CONTROL, YOU KNOW, I REALIZE THE NEWS NETWORKS WILL PROBABLY SAY THAT VERBATIM, BUT YOU MAY BE WONDERING, WELL, HOW WILL WE KNOW IF THE SENATE CHANGES CONTROL AND WE DON'T HAVE A TELEVISION AND WE LIVE OUTSIDE WITHIN A COUPLE OF BLOCKS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING?
YOU CAN KEEP TABS ON THE CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE IN A VERY, VERY COOL WAY AND ONLY HERE ON CNN, THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. CHECK THIS OUT. IF THE DEMOCRATS MAINTAIN THEIR MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THE BUILDING WILL FLASH IN BLUE. IF THE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL, IT WILL FLASH BRIGHT RED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT IS AMAZING. THAT IS SO COOL! THAT WOULD BE LIKE IF THE BRITISH WERE COMING AND PAUL REVERE HAD (BLEEP) OF MONEY TO WASTE. (LAUGHTER) WELL LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU DON'T OWN HALLOWED LANDMARKS IN NEW YORK, CNN.  TONIGHT, IF REPUBLICANS TAKE BACK THE SENATE, WE WILL REPLACE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY'S TORCH AND TABLET  WITH AN AK 47 AND A BIBLE. BOOM! BEAT THAT. AND IF DEMOCRATS BY SOME STRANGE STROKE OF LUCK KEEP THE SENATE, WHICH IS NOT HAPPENING, THE WORLD WILL FIND OUT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE KEPT IT BECAUSE THE DAILY SHOW WILL BLOW UP THE MOON. THE MOON! I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THE MOON BLOWING UP. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE RESULTS FOR YOU LATER, BUT FIRST, TEAM COVERAGE AT VARIOUS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. JASON JONES IS OUT WITH TONIGHT'S BIG WINNER. JASON, HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND?
I'M GREAT! JON, THANK YOU.
Jon: GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
JON, AS YOU CAN SEE THE CELEBRATION IS WELL UNDERWAY, INCREDIBLE NIGHT FOR MONEY IN POLITICS! OKAY? AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT LOOKS LIKE ALL $6.5 BILLION THAT PARTICIPATED IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION ARE HERE TONIGHT. BUNDLED MONEY. SUPER PAC MONEY. ECCENTRIC BILLIONAIRE MONEY! AND NOT TO TALK OUT OF SCHOOL, BUT I THINK I GOT A GLIMPSE OF UNTRACEABLE DARK MONEY IN THE VIP ROOM.
Jon: REALLY? WHAT, NOW WHAT, WHAT WAS THE DARK MONEY DOING?
WHATEVER THE (BLEEP) IT WANTS.
Jon: I GET THAT. WELL, QUITE A SUCCESS STORY TONIGHT FOR MONEY.
SERIOUSLY. AND SUCH A TURN AROUND FROM JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN MANY DENOMINATIONS FACED REAL DISCRIMINATION. I STILL REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN PEOPLE SPOKE OPENLY ABOUT BANNING MONEY FROM THE POLITICAL PROCESS. WELL, TONIGHT, $6.5 BILLION LATER, THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T TALKING! MONEY IS!
Jon: THANK YOU, JASON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH! SAM BEE IS AT MONEY'S OPPONENT IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION, IDEAS. IDEAS, IDEAS HEADQUARTERS.
YES, YES, JON. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, IT'S BEEN A TOUGH NIGHT FOR IDEAS. JUST MINUTES AGO, I CAN REPORT IDEAS CONCEDED TO MONEY. OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A COLLECT CALL. IDEAS, (LAUGHTER) IDEAS IS IN VERY ROUGH SHAPE.
Jon: SAM, YOU KNOW, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IDEAS WERE ON THE BALLOT THIS YEAR.
YEAH, YEAH, IDEAS DIDN'T PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT. APPEARED IN VERY FEW ADS. I MEAN, THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T SHOW UP TO ANY DEBATES.
Jon: RIGHT, NO I UNDERSTAND THAT.
WOO-HOO!
Jon: OH I'M SORRY, WE'RE HEARING A WOO! LET'S GO BACK OUT TO MONEY HEADQUARTERS. SOMETHING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT'S UP MOTHER (BLEEP)?
THAT'S RIGHT! JONNIE, LOOK WHO'S HERE!
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. MONEY.
THEY SAID WE COULDN'T DO IT! THEY SAID WE COULDN'T DO IT, BUT WE SHOWED THEM. WHO DOESN'T EQUAL FREE SPEECH NOW, BITCHES!? WOOO!
Jon: WELL, MONEY, MONEY, IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU FACE TO FACE.
OH, PLEASE, STEWART... I THINK WE'VE MET. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL, OBVIOUSLY, MONEY, YOU'VE HAD A GREAT NIGHT. ARE YOU PLEASED THAT REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TAKE THE SENATE, MONEY?
I DON'T GIVE A (BLEEP). IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, ALL GREEN IN THE DARK. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WELL, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW REPUBLICANS LOVE ME, BUT THE LITTLE SECRET IS IT'S ALMOST MORE EXCITING WITH THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY PLAY HARD TO GET. NO! I DON'T WANT IT! NO, PLEASE, DON'T GIVE IT TO ME! NO, DON'T! OH, IS THAT A 20! OH! IT FEELS SO GOOD! OH, MORE, MORE!
Jon: ALL RIGHT, I GET IT, BUT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING YOU'VE SET OUT TO DO, MONEY.
OH, WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED, BABY, 2016 IS GONNA MAKE 2014 LOOK LIKE A FAT CHEERLEADER'S CAR WASH! WOOO!
OH MY GOD!
Jon: OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER, SAM BEE?
IT'S JUST THAT MONEY IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE! GOD, I WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY JUST TO GET IT OUT OF POLITICS. I MEAN, C'MON, YOU GUYS! YOU GOT NOTHING?
Jon: BUT ARE THEY ALL OUT OF IDEAS THERE?
WELL THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO TURN ON THE LIGHT BULBS BECAUSE THEY SAID IT REMINDED THEM OF HAPPIER TIMES.
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S JUST THAT --
C'MON, YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT! YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.
TAKE A TAXI CAB LATER. JESUS CHRIST. OKAY, GIVE IT TO ME! FINE! NO, I NEED THAT.
WORKS EVERY TIME, BABY!
WAIT.
C'MON, JONESIE, LET'S YOU AND ME GET DOWN! LET'S YOU AND ME GET OUT OF HERE! (LAUGHTER) LET'S YOU AND ME GET THIS PARTY STARTED RIGHT, ALL RIGHT? LET'S ROLL ME UP! ALRIGHT? TOOT TOOT!
ALRIGHT, YEAH.
I'M TALKING ABOUT COCAINE.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. SAMANTHA BEE, JASON JONES AND MONEY, EVERYBODY! ALRIGHT, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
