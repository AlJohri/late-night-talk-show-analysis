FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD PROGRAM TONIGHT. WE'VE WORKED ON IT. WE'RE VERY  EXCITED. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, BEN STEELE. HE'S HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS DOCUMENTARY, "HUNTED: THE WAR AGAINST GAYS IN RUSSIA". IT'S GOT FOOTAGE IN IT -- IT'S, IT'S YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. YOU THINK ABOUT OUR FIELD PIECES SOMETIMES, YOU THINK HOW DID YOU GET PEOPLE TO COME ON AND SAY THAT? THIS THING?  HOLY (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  BUT FIRST, IF YOU'VE  BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE  NEWS LATELY, YOU MIGHT HAVE  HEARD, WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
EBOLA IN AMERICA.
THE VERY DEADLY AND CONTAGIOUS  VIRUS MAY HAVE SPREAD.
THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST  ISIS.
WARNING OF ATTACKS IN THE U.S.
THEY INTEND TO KILL US.
CRISIS ON THE BORDER.
WHO'S COMING TO AMERICA.
WE HAVE A BORDER THAT IS SO  POROUS EBOLA OR ISIS OR  EBOLA ON THE BACKS OF ISIS COULD  COME THROUGH OUR BORDER.
Jon: EBOLA ON THE BACKS -- I'VE GOT TO SAY EBOLA ON THE BACKS OF ISIS IT SHOULD SOUND TERRIFYING, BUT I HAVE -- HOW CUTE WOULD THAT BE, TO SEE ISIS GIVING EBOLA A PIGGYBACK RIDE? OH LOOK A LITTLE EBOLA. SO AMERICA IS UNDER ATTACK  FROM EBOLA AND MILITANTS AND  POROUS BORDERS. AND WHILE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS OF THOSE THINGS CAN BE COUNTED ON TWO SIMPSONS HANDS, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT!
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER  IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR  CITIZENS AND OUR HOMELAND IS  PROTECTED.
IF OUR MILITARY COMMANDERS TELL THAT WE NEED  GROUND FORCES TO DEFIGHT ISIL,  SO BE IT.
WHAT ABOUT A MERCENARY  ARMY?
VIRTUAL FENCE. VIRTUAL SURVEILLANCE.
A COMPLETE IMPENETRABLE  BORDER.
A DOUBLE FENCE, A TRIPLE FENCE.
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
WHATEVER IT TAKES. ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SAY, FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS  NOBODY FROM WEST AFRICA GETS INTO THE UNITED STATES. SORRY.
Jon: WOW. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. IN AFRICA U.S. TRAVEL POLICY  150 YEARS MAKES. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY, I WOULD IMAGINE THAT AFRICANS WOULD HAVE LOVED THAT PROPOSAL, THEY WOULD HAVE LOVED THAT PROPOSAL 200 YEARS AGO. BUT THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR,  WHATEVER IT TAKES! THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OBLIGATION  TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO  PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES.
HEART DISEASE. IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF  DEATH, KILLING 600,000  AMERICANS A YEAR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S LIKE MILWAUKEE  DISAPPEARING EVERY YEAR. THAT'S LIKE IF YOU TOOK ALL  THE AMERICANS KILLED BY ISIS  AND EBOLA, AND ADDED ALMOST 600,000 TO IT. SURELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, HAVING A SACRED OBLIGATION TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SAVE  AMERICAN LIVES, SHOULD TAKE SOME ACTION TO PREVENT THIS  HEART DISEASE.
GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T BE  TELLING US WHAT TO EAT.
THE FOOD POLICE.
HUNGRY HIGH SCHOOLERS ARE ALREADY FED UP.
THEY CLAIM THEY'RE BEING  STARVED BY GOVERNMENT  MANDATES.
SCHOOLS FORCING KIDS TO GO  MEATLESS ON MONDAYS.
DO YOU SAY THAT MEATLESS MONDAYS ARE BRAIN WASHING?
CLEARLY IT IS.
Jon: CLEARLY. WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES  TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. ALTHOUGH, IF WE CANNOT EAT  MEAT AT EVERY SCHOOL LUNCH, IS  THAT REALLY LIVING? (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, FINE. GOOD DIETARY HEALTH IS  TYRANNY. MAYBE WE CAN SAVE PEOPLE POST INEVITABLE HEART DISEASE. MAYBE WE COULD EXPAND MEDICAID. THAT WOULD PREVENT APPARENTLY BETWEEN 7,000 AND 17,000 AMERICAN DEATHS PER YEAR. WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?
TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM IS NOT UNLIKE ADDING A THOUSAND  PEOPLE TO THE TITANIC. YOU'RE GOING TO FURTHER DRIVE  THIS COUNTRY INTO DEBT.
THERE ARE 18 NEW TAXES  EMBEDDED IN OBAMACARE AND  MEDICAID EXPANSIONS.
STATES ALREADY STRUGGLE TO PAY THE COST OF IT.
Jon: THE GOVERNMENT HAS A  SACRED OBLIGATION TO SAVE  AMERICAN LIVES ABOVE THE  POVERTY LINE! (LAUGHTER) THIS DOESN'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT THERE'S THIS OTHER THING. AMERICA HAS A LOT OF GUN DEATHS.
GUN CONTROL LAWS DO NOT  MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER.
Jon: I KNOW. I KNOW, IT'S JUST THAT 32,000 PEOPLE IN AMERICA ANNUALLY, 88 A DAY -- THE
THE ISSUE IS NOT GUNS, IT'S  CRIMINALS.
CRIMINALS WILL NEVER GO THROUGH  A BACKGROUND CHECK.
CRIMINALS DO CRIME, THEY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO OUR  LAWS.
Jon: THE GOVERNMENT HAS A  SACRED OBLIGATION TO DO  WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SAVE  AMERICAN LIVES UNLESS IT'S  THROUGH A LAW THAT CRIMINALS  WOULD BREAK. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
I HESITATE TO BRING THIS UP. I HESITATE, I HESITATE TO BRING THIS UP. THEY SAY THAT FIGHTING CLIMATE  CHANGE WOULD SAVE A LOT OF  AMERICAN --
THE COST OF THESE CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS ON FAMILIES AND ON COMMUNITIES ARE VERY REAL.
IT IS A JOB KILLER. IT IS BASED ON QUESTIONABLE SCIENCE.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO SAY THE DANGER IS GREAT, THEREFORE WE ARE FREE TO DEMAND THE NATION SPEND WHATEVER IS NECESSARY.
Jon: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU (BLEEP) SUGGEST ALL THE TIME! DID YOU NOT SEE THE WHATEVER IT TAKES MONTAGE FROM EARLIER? IT'S EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. ALL WE KEEP HEARING IS WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES  TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES, UNLESS  IT'S STOPPING THE THINGS THAT  IS ARE ACTUALLY KILLING  AMERICANS. IT'S LIKE WHEN THE AIRLINE  SAYS WE'LL DO WHATEVER IT  TAKES TO ENSURE YOU HAVE A  COMFORTABLE FLIGHT, EXCEPT  FEED YOU OR CIRCULATE FRESH AIR, OR GIVE YOU ROOM TO MOVE OR KEEP THE PASSENGER IN FRONT OF YOU FROM A DRUNKEN (BLEEP) ON THE DRINK CART. ANYWAY, PLEASE ENJOY YOUR COMPLIMENTARY CRYING BABY. FOR SOME REASON, FOR SOME REASON  IN THIS COUNTRY WE'RE ONLY  AFRAID OF BAD THINGS ENTERING  OUR COUNTRY, CROSSING OUR  SACRED BORDERS. WHEN OUR SHELVES ARE ALREADY  SO STOCKED WITH BAD (BLEEP) IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE SAYING  WHEN I DIE, I WANT TO KNOW MY  PREVENTABLE DEATH HAS A LABEL  ON IT THAT SAYS MADE IN  AMERICA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE)
