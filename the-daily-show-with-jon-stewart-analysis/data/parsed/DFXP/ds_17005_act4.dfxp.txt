Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW. YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER THIS. YEARS AND YEARS AGO WE USED TO HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED BOOKS. THEY WERE LIKE PAPER. YOU WOULD HOLD THEM IN YOUR HAND AND MOVE THEM AROUND. WE WROTE ONE. AND WE MADE IT OUT OF A HARD COVER. NOW WE'VE MADE IT SOFTER. YOU CAN GET IT. EACH ONE OF THEM WAS GIVEN ONE UNDER THEIR CHAIRS. OH, THAT'S EXCITING. IT GOES ON SALE AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. ENJOY. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN. ♪ IMAGINE THERE'S NO PIZZA ♪♪  ♪ I COULDN'T IF I TRIED ♪♪
