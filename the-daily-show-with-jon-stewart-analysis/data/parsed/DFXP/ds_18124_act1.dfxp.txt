Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW ABOUT  JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER. WE HAVE A FANTASTIC SHOW FOR  YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST THIS EVENING IS TOM  GOLDSTEIN HERE TO TALK TO US  ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT. OF COURSE I'M STILL HERE FOR  JON STEWART WHO IS CURRENTLY  SEARCHING FOR TREASURE BASED ON A MAP HE FOUND ON THE  BACK OF THE CONSTITUTION. (LAUGHTER)  THERE YOU GO, THAT'S --
THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.
OH MY GOSH. [BLEEP].
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HOLY [BLEEP], IT'S JON  STEWART LIVE FROM THE MIDDLE  EAST VIA SKYPE, JON, JON, YOU HAVE A BEARD. THERE'S A BEARD ON YOUR  FACE.
KNOX, I DIDN'T GROW IT,  ITS-- WHEN YOU GET OFF THE  PLAIN IN THE MIDDLE EAST THEY GIVE IT TO YOU LIKE THE  HAWAIIAN GIVE YOU A LEI.
THAT MAKES SENSEMENT YOU  WEAR IT WITH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE  SEEN, WE HAVE BEEN DOING  LIVE FROM THE START OF THE  SLOW ABOUT WHERE YOU'VE  BEEN. AND WE'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT  THAT. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THOSE?
WELL, HAVE YOU SAID THAT  I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH  EDWARD SNOWDEN IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER BECAUSE  THAT'S --
BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING  THAT WOULD NOT BE TRUE, IS  THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
Jon: SURE. THAT'S WHAT MI SAYING, IT'S  NOT TRUE.
WE ALL MISS YOU. EVERYBODY MISSES YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE MISS YOU!
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS.
WHAT?
Jon: YOU'RE DOING A  PHENOMENAL JOB. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
STOP IT. I DON'T WATCH IT ALL THE  TIME BECAUSE IT'S TOO WEIRD,  IT'S LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE HAVE SEX WITH YOUR WIFE'S  WIFE'S-- DESK.
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL  DESK. YOUR des SOMETHING  BEAUTIFUL.
Jon: BUT I MISS YOU GUYS  LIKE CRAZY CAKES. I LOVE YOU GUYS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU. THIS HAS BEEN EXCITING AND  INVIGORATING BUT WEIRD AS  HELL. AND I JUST WANTED TO CHECK  IN AND TELL YOU I WAS  THINKING ABOUT YOU GUYS. AND YOU ARE DOING GREAT.
WE HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH,  YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT, HERE. NOTHING MUCH CHANGED HERE.
Jon: GOOD.
THE ONLY KEY THINGS IS WE  PLAY GOVERNMENT BALL AGAINST  THE METS EVERY MONDAY AND BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN COMES TO  PLAY EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT.
Jon: WHAT!
AND THEN-- .
Jon: THAT'S MY FAVORITE  MUSICIAN.
WE DIDN'T THINK THEY  WOULD BE THINGS THAT YOU  WOULD ENJOY. THAT'S ALL. THEY DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOUR  KIND OF THING.
Jon: I WANT TO COME HOME! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE MISS YOU! WE LOVE YOU, JON STEWART,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH  THE SUPREME COURT, LANDMARK  RULINGS YESTERDAY, STRIKING DOWN PART OF THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT AND PROP 8 IN  CALIFORNIA. A HUGE DAY! A HUGE DAY FOR CIVIL RIGHTS  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
AND ALL OF THIS IS THE  SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S SPECIAL  REPORT.
YES, YESTERDAY AMERICA  TOOK A GIANT BOLD LEAP INTO  THE PRESENT. AND IT WAS A 5-4 DECISION  WITH ONE JUDGE IN PARTICULAR  MAKING THE DIFFERENCE.
THE IMPORTANCE OF ANTHONY  KENNEDY CANNOT BE  OVERSTATED.
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN  THREE GAY RIGHTS, MAJOR GAY  RIGHTS DECISIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE SUPREME  COURT.
ALL THREE OF THOSE CASES  WERE WRITTEN BY ANTHONY  KENNEDY. HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY  AS IN ESSENCE THE FATHER OF  CONSTITUTIONAL GAY RIGHTS.
YEAH, AND THE GOOD KIND  OF FATHER OF SOMETHING GAY. NOT THE KIND OF FATHER WHO  INSISTS YOU THROW A FOOTBALL  WITH HIM AND IT WOULD NEVER COME TO A SINGLE ONE OF YOUR  SHOW CHOIR PERFORMANCES. YOU MIGHT NOT THINK IT'S  IMPORTANT, DAD, BUT IT'S  IMPORTANT TO ME! OF COURSE-- OF COURSE. NOT EVERY ONE WAS HAPPY WITH  THIS DECISION. BUT SOMEONE WAS EXACTLY AS  UNHAPPY WITH IT AS YOU WOULD  IMAGINE. SCALIA. THE JUSTICE WHOSE NAME MOST  RESEMBLES A G.I. JOE VILLEAN.
HE SAID THE COURT A  OPINION TALKING ABOUT THE  ONE STRIKING DOWN DOMA  SPRINGS FROM THE SAME DISEASED ROOT AND EXALTED  NOTION OF THE ROLE OF THIS  COURT IN AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC  SOCIETY.
HE CALLED IT LEGALLISTIC  ARGLE FARGEL?
WHOA, WHOA, ARGLE FARGEL  IS A LITTLE HAR BE, ISN'T  IT? OR IS IT? I DONE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. THESE SUPREME COURT SCHOLARS  ARE GOING TO HAVE A TOUGH  TIME INTERPRETING THAT IN THE FUTURE. IT COULD MEAN IT'S ANGRY T  COULD MEAN HE'S CHOKING ON A  PEN TOP. IT COULD MEAN HE WAS SCUBA  DIVING AT THE TIME AND  TRYING TO COMMUNICATE VIA  SONAR. ARGLE FARGEL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT LOOK, LOOK, JUSTICE  SCALIA IS FAR FROM ALONE IN  HIS DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE  RULING. YESTERDAY MORE THAN A DOZEN  MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN  STUDY COMMITTEE GOT TOGETHER IN FRONT OF LESS THAN A  DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PRESS  TO SHARE THEIR FEELINGS.
THE SUPREME COURT WANT TO  ITS DICTATE TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE WHAT ELECTED LEGISLATORS CAN DO REGARDING  FEDERAL LAW.
AND NOW WE HAVE AN  EFFECTIVE OLIGARCHEE OF FIVE  WITHOUT DECIDE WHAT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF OUR  DAY.
IT'S A SAD DAY WHEN  UNELECTED JUDGES CHANGE THE  DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE AND TURN THEIR BACKS ON THE WILL  OF VOTERS.
YEAH, BUT HERE'S THE  THING ABOUT THAT. IF WE DID EVERYTHING  AMERICAN VOTESERS WANTED, WE  WOULD LONG AGO HAVE REPLACED  OUR CLEAN WATER SUPPLY WITH MOUNTAIN DEW AND RED BULL. ED WHOLE-- THE WHOLE POINT  OF THE SUPREME COURT IS TO  KEEP US IN CHECK. SOMETIMES WE AS A NATION  MAKE BAD DECISIONS. AND THE COURT HAS TO COME IN  AND SAY SORRY, BUDDY, GIVE  US YOUR KEYS, YOU'RE REALLY GOING REGRET SEGREGATING  SCHOOLS TOMORROW MORNING. THERE IS A REASON THAT LADY  JUSTICE IS BLINDFOLDED  HOLDING SCALES AND NOT  GIVING A WINK AND A THUMBS  UP. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S THE POINT OF THE  SUPREME COURT. BUT LOOK, I FIND IT HARD TO  BELIEVE THAT THIS IS JUST  STRICTLY AN INTELLECTUAL  ARGUMENT. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS ANGER AT  THE SUPREME COURT MIGHT BE  COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
THE SUPREME COURT THOUGH  THEY MAY THINK SO, HAVE NOT  YET ARISEN TO THE LEVEL OF  GOD.
THEY WERE NOT AWARE THAT  THE MOST WISE MAN IN HISTORY  SOLOMAN SAID THERE'S NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN.
NOW, NOW, NOW, LET'S BE  FAIR, HOLD ON. SALOMON DID SAY THAT, IN  FACT, HE MIGHT HAVE SAID IT  TO ONE OF HIS 700 WIVES OR ONE OF HIS 300 CONCUBINES  BUT I'M SORRY YOU WERE  CLEARLY WARMING UP TO  SOMETHING.
WHAT WE NOW HAVE TODAY IS  A HOLY QUINTET WITHOUT GOES  AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE AND NATURE'S GUIDE.
REALLY? IF YOUR BRAIN CAN'T PROCESS  GOD'S CREATURES ENJOYING  DIFFERENT KINDS OF SEX, YOU DON'T WANT TO BRING NATURE  INTO THIS. BECAUSE NATURE IS WHERE DOGS  HUMP EACH OTHER IN THE FACE,  IN THE FACE, THAT'S NATURE THAT IS ALL NATURAL, MY  FRIEND. JUST AS GOD INTENDED. WHOA, WHOA! (APPLAUSE)
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. LET'S TRY AND ELEVATE THIS  DECADE-- DECADE-- DEBATE,  ENOUGH WITH YOU CANNOT UNSEE WHAT YOU JUST SAW. LET'S ELEVATE THIS DEBATE. ENOUGH FROM THE HOUSE MBS. LET'S HEAR FROM A UNITED  STATES SENATOR.
I THINK THIS IS A  CONUNDRUM.
IF WE HAVE NO LAWS ON  THIS PEOPLE TAKE IT TO ONE  EXTENSION FURTHER, DOES IT HAVE TO BE HUMANS.
WHAT IS IT-- WHAT IS IT  WITH THESE PEOPLE AND ANIMALS? EVERY TIME, THIS IS THE ONLY  ISSUE AS WELL WHERE YOU GO  THERE, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GO THERE WITH O BAM ARCARE, OH,  THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT,  WHAT IS NEXT, ARE WE GOING TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO  TURTLES? IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT SEX THAT YOU  ARE DEFINITELY NOT PERVERTED  BRAINS GO STRAIGHT TO  ANIMALS. LOOK, LOOK, SENATOR, IT  SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A  PERSONAL FIGHT FOR YOU. PERHAPS AND I'M JUST  GUESSING, YOU'RE IN A  RELATIONSHIP WITH ANIMAL AND  YOU FEAR THAT THIS COURT RULING IS PUSHING YOU IN A  DIRECTION WHERE YOU WILL BE  PRESSURED TO GET MARRIED. BUT RELAX. YOU DON'T NEED A PIECE OF  PAPER TO DEFINE YOUR LOVE. AS A WISEMAN ONCE SAID, KEEP--   (LAU
