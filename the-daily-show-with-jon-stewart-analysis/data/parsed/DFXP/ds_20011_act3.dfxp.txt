[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "KILLING PATTON, THE STRANGE DEATH OF WORLD WAR II'S MOST AUDACIOUS GENERAL." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO OUR PROGRAM MR. WILLIAM O'REILLY. WILLIAM! HELLO, WILLIAM. NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR. [APPLAUSE] HAVE A SEAT. I'M GLAD GIVEN THE EBOLA SCARE YOU STILL ARE SHAKING MY HAND. I THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE STEP. I KNOW YOU'RE VERY FRIGHTENED AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY. THERE YOU GO, BABY. [LAUGHTER] GET THAT GOING. SETTLE DOWN. THE BOOK IS CALLED BILL O'REILLY "KILLING PATTON." IT'S LIKE WHAT LIKE THE EIGHTH, WE'RE JUST GOING CALL THIS KILLING TREES. THEY SELL LIKE CRAZY, SOME OF THEM. [LAUGHTER]
YOU DIDN'T READ IT, THOUGH HUH?
Jon: NO, I DID NOT READ IT. LISTEN TO ME.
YEAH.
Jon: HERE'S ALL I WANT FROM YOU TODAY.
UH HUH.
Jon: THIS IS IT.
YEP.
Jon: THIS IS ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IN THIS CONVERSATION.
OKAY.
Jon: JUST ONE, I HAVE ONE SIMPLE GOAL.
YEAH.
Jon: I WANT YOU TO ADMIT THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS WHITE PRIVILEGE, THAT'S ALL I WANT.
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT.
Jon: THAT'S ALL I WANT. THAT'S IT. JUST A LITTLE,  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  I JUST WANT YOU TO SAY I AM, I'M TERRIBLY TERRIBLY WRONG ON THIS.
Jon:  OKAY, LOOK, IF THERE'S WHITE PRIVILEGE THEN THERE HAS TO BE ASIAN PRIVILEGE.
Jon: WHAT?
BECAUSE ASIANS MAKE MORE MONEY THAN WHITES.
Jon: WHAT?
OH YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS HUH?
Jon: WELL NOT, NOT, WHAT KIND OF ASIAN? YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY.
ASIAN AMERICANS. ASIAN AMERICANS.
WELL NO, BUT, IT DEPENDS WHERE THEY'RE FROM. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT --
THEY'RE FROM ASIA. THEY'RE ASIAN AMERICANS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT AS A --
GOOD. THEY MAKE MORE MONEY, HIGHER EDUCATION, MORE AFFLUENT. SO IT'S ASIAN PRIVILEGE, NOT WHITE PRIVILEGE.
Jon: YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.
OH. SORRY TO CONFUSE YOU WITH FACTS.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT, IT'S NOT, THAT'S, OKAY. HERE WE GO.
YEAH.
Jon: THE ASIAN EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA, THE ASIAN IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE...
YES.
Jon: IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE BLACK EXPERIENCE.
YES.
Jon: SO IT'S REALLY, THEY'RE NOT EQUIVALENT. AND EITHER WAY, WHITE PEOPLE, MALES SET THE SYSTEM. SO THAT'S WHAT PRIVILEGE IS, IS THAT WHITE PEOPLE SET THE SYSTEM THAT YES MAYBE ASIAN IMMIGRANTS ONCE IMMIGRATION POLICY WAS LIBERALIZED HAVE DONE BETTER OVER THESE PAST 30 OR 40 YEARS. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMIC, SYSTEMIC SYSTEMATIZED SUBJUGATION OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. WOULD YOU NOT AGREE WITH THAT?
SURE. THAT WAS THEN. THIS IS NOW.
OH IT'S, THERE WAS WHITE PRIVILEGE BUT IT NO LONGER EXISTS.
WAIT, WAIT, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT THERE IS NO MORE SLAVERY, NO MORE JIM CROW, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
AND THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. OH BOY, HERE WE GO.
IS A BLACK AMERICAN.
Jon: OH BOY.
AND THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD, OPRAH WINFREY IS BLACK, OKAY.
Jon: BEING ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE A FREE CAR DOES NOT MAKE YOU THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD. BUT LISTEN, BUT LISTEN CLOSE -- BECAUSE I SEE --
DON'T MESS WITH OPRAH.
Jon: I SEE THE ISSUE HERE. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE RESIDUAL EFFECT OF, I MEAN SLAVERY AND JIM CROW ARE DEAD. BUT THE RESIDUAL EFFECT OF THAT SYSTEMIC SUBJUGATION EXISTS TODAY.
SURE. IT ABSOLUTELY EXISTS TODAY, BUT --
Jon: LET'S GO A DIFFERENT WAY.
IT EXISTS FOR EVERY RACE, NOT AT THAT EXTENT, ALL RIGHT?
Jon: SO, THAT'S WHITE PRIVILEGE. OH BOY.
BUT YOU DON'T PUT FORTH, ALL RIGHT, THIS OH WHITE PRIVILEGE AND IF YOU FAIL THAT'S WHY YOU FAIL, ALL RIGHT. AMERICA'S NOW A PLACE WHERE IF YOU WORK HARD, GET EDUCATED AND AN HONEST PERSON, YOU CAN SUCCEED. THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE PUT OUT THERE. NOT ALL THIS OTHER STUFF.
YOU ARE CARRYING, YOU ARE CARRYING, YOU ARE CARRYING MORE OF A BURDEN AS A BLACK PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY THAN A WHITE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY FROM --
COLLECTIVELY YES BUT NOT --
Jon: NO, INDIVIDUALLY.
LISTEN, INDIVIDUALLY EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE IS DIFFERENT.
Jon: THEY DON'T STOP AND FRISK WALL STREET BANKERS EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE DONE FAR MORE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY.
THEY DON'T STOP AND FRISK WALL STREET BANKERS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHITE PEOPLE, LISTEN TO ME. WHITE PEOPLE, WHITE PEOPLE DO MORE DRUGS IN THIS COUNTRY THAN BLACK PEOPLE...
YES.
Jon: BUT BLACK PEOPLE MAKE UP A FAR HIGHER MAJORITY OF DRUG ARRESTS.
DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?
Jon: YES.
YOU DO KNOW WHY THAT IS? WHY IS THAT.
BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S ABOUT REAL ESTATE TO SOME EXTENT. THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEMIC SUBJUGATION THROUGH REAL ESTATE. BLACK PEOPLE ARE GHETTOIZED IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THOSE GHETTOS --
THEY'RE FORCED TO LIVE THERE. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.
Jon: OH, YOU'RE GETTING TO A BAD PLACE MY FRIEND. WHAT MADE YOUR CULTURALLY? DO YOU THINK YOUR UP BRINGING GAVE YOU VALUES, ETHICS?
YES, YES IT DID.
Jon: YOU DIDN'T GROW UP RICH, RIGHT?
NO. WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY AT ALL.
Jon: BUT YOU WORKED HARD.
I DID.
Jon: RIGHT. YOU WORKED HARD.
RIGHT.
Jon: YOU LIVED WHERE?
LEVITTOWN.
Jon: LEVITTOWN.
NEW YORK.
Jon: SO IT GAVE YOU A NICE STABLE, A CHEAP HOME. THERE'S WAS NO DOWN PAYMENTS, THERE WAS THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. NO, THOSE HOUSES WERE SUBSIDIZED.
OH, IT WAS LAVISH.
Jon: NO IT WASNT LAVISH. BUT IT WAS STABLE.
THEY WEREN'T SUBSIDIZED, IT WAS SOLD TO GI'S AND THE GI'S GOT A MORTGAGE THEY COULD AFFORD.
Jon: BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION.
LOOK YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.
Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. LET ME JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION.
YES.
Jon: DID THAT UPBRINGING LEAVE A MARK ON YOU EVEN TODAY?
OF COURSE. EVERY UPBRINGING LEAVES A MARK ON PEOPLE.
GREAT. GREAT. COULD BLACK PEOPLE LIFE IN LEVITTOWN?
NOT AT THAT TIME THEY COULD NOT.
SO THAT MY FRIEND IS WHAT WE CALL IN THE BUSINESS WHITE PRIVILEGE.
MY FRIEND? OKAY. THAT WAS IN -- [CROWD CHEERING]
Jon: NO.
THAT WAS IN 1950, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: 1950.
1950.
Jon: WERE THERE BLACK PEOPLE LIVING THERE IN 1960?
IN LEVITTOWN?
Jon: YES.
I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: THERE WEREN'T.
HOW DO YOU KNOW.
Jon: BECAUSE I READ UP ON IT.
OH, YOU READ UP. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
Jon: I DO KNOW THAT.
I COULD FIND SOMEBODY.
Jon: MY POINT IS EVEN  TODAY --
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LIVE THERE? IT'S A NICE PLACE BUT IT'S NOT A PLAKE LIKE YOU, IT'S NOT LIKE BEL AIR, COME ON.
Jon: BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE THAT BUILT VALUES. WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS, IMAGINE GROWING UP --
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS THAT BUILD VALUES. MILLIONS OF THEM.
Jon: BUT IMAGINE GROWING UP KNOWING THAT YOU AS AN AMERICAN.
YEAH.
Jon: AS A GI WHO FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II.
YEAH.
Jon: COULDN'T BUY INTO THAT BECAUSE YOU WERE LESS. YOU WERE NOT --
IT WAS UNFAIR. IT WAS UNFAIR.
Jon: AND THE RESIDUE OF THAT CONTINUES TODAY AND THAT IS WHITE PRIVILEGE.
THE RESIDUE OF THAT. IT'S, IT'S, ALL RIGHT, IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT'S WHITE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE WHITES DIDN'T HAVE IT AS BAD AS BLACKS.
Jon: I'M NOT SAYING IT'S AN EXCUSE. I'M SAYING IT EXISTS.
FINE.
Jon: THAT'S IT!
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY.
Jon: YES, IT IS.
NO, IT'S NOT. LET ME REPEAT THIS AND I'LL DO IT SLOWLY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SO EVEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU WORK HARD, IF YOU GET EDUCATED, IF YOU'RE AN HONEST PERSON, YOU CAN MAKE IT IN AMERICA.
Jon: IF YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE, POVERTY IS ENDEMIC IT'S HARDER TO WORK HARD.
YEAH.
Jon: IT'S HARDER TO GET AN EDUCATION.
HEY, IT WAS HARDER ON ME THAN IT WAS FOR THE WHITE GUY IN GARDEN CITY. IT'S ALL RELATIVE, YES. IT'S HARDER IF YOU'RE A GHETTO KID. YES, BUT CAN YOU DO IT? YES.
Jon: YES, YOU CAN. SO WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT? WHY IS IT THAT WHITE PEOPLE GET SO DEFENSIVE ABOUT THIS? I'M NOT SAYING THAT LIFE ISN'T HARD. MIDDLE CLASS WHITE GUYS THAT ARE WORKING HARD TO DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THEY LOOK AND THEY GO I'M NOT GETTING ANY PRIVILEGE. AT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING   ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE BROUGHT HERE. THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO IMMIGRATE HERE TO GET THAT BETTER LIFE. AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR COUNTRIES HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT, AND WE CAN MOVE --
PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHO ARE FAIR MINDED. BUT YOU DON'T THEN TAKE THAT AND THEN CONDEMN THE MODERN SOCIETY.
Jon: NOBODY'S -- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL CALL IT, I'LL CALL IT THIS AND IT'S A WORD I THINK YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. A FACTOR. IT'S A FACTOR.
IT'S A FACTOR.
Jon: IT'S A FACTOR.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE FACTOR.
Jon: YOUR HUMILITY HAS MOVED ME. YOU ARE LIKE POPE FRANCIS THAT HAS TAKEN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH INTO AN ERA OF ACCEPTANCE AND HUMILITY.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU, YOU BILL O'REILLY CAN LEAD THE FLOCK OF THE FOX FEARFUL TO A BETTER PLACE. I BELIEVE IN YOU.
