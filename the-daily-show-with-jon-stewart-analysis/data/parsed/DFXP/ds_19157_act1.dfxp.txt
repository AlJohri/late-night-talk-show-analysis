FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, INCREDIBLE TIMING -- WE DID NOT PLAN IT -- GENERAL AND FORMER COMMANDER OF CENTCOM, ANTHONY ZINNI IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HE HAS A NEW BOOK OUT, "BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS ARE FIRED." THAT'S HIS NEW BOOK. I ONLY CAN REALLY ONLY SAY TO HIM, TOO LATE!
THERE IS BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. THE PENTAGON SAYS THAT AIRSTRIKES AGAINST I.S.I.S. IN SYRIA HAS BEGUN.
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR WEEKS AND HERE IT IS TONIGHT.
Jon: OOH, IT'S SO ANTICIPATED! IT WAS THE  IPHONE 6 OF WARS! (LAUGHTER) IT'S EXPENSIVE, A LITTLE BIGGER... A LITTLE MORE UNWIELDY THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST A TWO-YEAR COMMITMENT. (APPLAUSE) KIND OF FEELS LIKE YOU JUST (BLEEP) GOT THE LAST ONE. (LAUGHTER) BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, AT LEAST IT'S NOT THE WATCH. SO HOW DID THE NEW PRODUCT LAUNCH GO?
THEY ATTACKED I.S.I.S. TARGETS AT FOUR LOCATIONS INSIDE SYRIA, INCLUDING HEADQUARTERS BUILDINGS, STORAGE FACILITIES, A FINANCE CENTER, SUPPLY TRUCKS, ARMED VEHICLES AND TRAINING COMPOUNDS.
Jon: CAN I BACK THAT UP FOR JUST A SECOND? I.S.I.S. HAS A FINANCE CENTER? I.S.I.S. HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR, LIKE, A MONTH... THEY'VE GOT A FINANCE INDUSTRY? NO, NO, THAT DESK IS FOR BOMBINGS AND MASS KILLINGS. YOU WANT SMALL BUSINESS LOANS, THAT'S DOWN THE HALL. SO WE HIT FOUR LOCATIONS, FOUR, FOR A VERY NARROWLY-FOCUSED, MINIMALIST APPROACH.
THEY DESCRIBED THE STRIKES AS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND ONLY THE BEGINNING. WE ALSO GOT A MENU OF THE WEAPONRY INVOLVED. GET A LIST OF THE DEVICES HERE. TOMAHAWK MISSILES. F-22 AIRCRAFT, F-15s, F-16s, F-18s.
Jon: ALL THE Fs WERE THERE! CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? F THOSE GUYS! THAT'S WHAT I SAY!  (LAUGHTER) NOW THE BIG WORRY AHEAD OF ALL THIS WAS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO THIS FIGHT ALONE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR! (WHISPERING)
WE'RE TOLD FOUR ARAB NATIONS ARE ALSO FLYING IN THE MISSIONS OVER SYRIA, SAUDI ARABIA, JORDAN, BAHRAIN AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAY A FIFTH NATION, QATAR, IS ALSO HELPING IN THE EFFORT BUT NOT BY AIR.
Jon: WHAT ARE THEY "CATERING?" WHAT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW IS QATAR HELPING? WE'RE DOING AIRSTRIKES. WHAT ARE THEY GIVING I.S.I.S. THE SILENT TREATMENT? AND THEN WHEN I.S.I.S. IS ALL, LIKE, QATAR, WHAT'S WRONG? ARE YOU MAD AT ME? QATAR'S LIKE -- NAH, IT'S COOL. AND IT WASN'T JUST QATAR WHOSE ROLE WAS LEFT ALARMINGLY VAGUE. THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY WAS ENOUGH TO BREAK 32-YEAR WAR CORRESPONDENT VETERAN JIM MIKLASZEWSKI.
SO FAR BAHRAIN HAS STEPPED FORWARD TO SAY, YES, THEY FLEW IN THAT MISSION BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THEY DID IN THAT MISSION. DID THEY, YOU KNOW, CUT DONUTS IN THE SKY OVER IRAQ FOR, YOU KNOW, TWO HOURS?
Jon: WHAT? DOING DONUTS IN THE SKY? JIM, I'M SURE THEY WEREN'T JUST DOING DONUTS IN THE SKY! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LISTEN TO THE COCKPIT RECORDINGS. LET'S JUST...I'M SORRY. I STAND CORRECTED. MAYBE THEY WERE DOING DONUTS. WELL, ALL RIGHT. THE COALITION HAS ATTACKED. WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE FROM I.S.I.S.?
ITS CHIEF SPOKESPERSON URGED SUPPORTERS AROUND THE WORLD, IF YOU CAN KILL A DISBELIEVING AMERICAN OR EUROPEAN, ESPECIALLY THE SPITEFUL FRENCH OR AN AUSTRALIAN OR A CANADIAN.
Jon: SPITEFUL AND FILTHY FRENCH, I'LL GIVE YOU. CAN'T NECESSARILY ARGUE THAT. BUT WHAT'S WITH TOSSING IN AUSTRALIAN OR CANADIAN, AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT, LIKE THEY'RE PROFESSOR AND MARY ANN OF INFIDELS. YOU KNOW WHAT, IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU'VE GOT SNAPS-WISE I.S.I.S., I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO PRETTY WELL IN THE MEDIA WAR.
THEY CALLED JOHN KERRY AN UNCIRCUMCISED OLD GEEZER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S SO SPECIFIC! I CAN'T BELIEVE I.S.I.S. HAS INFILTRATED JOHN KERRY'S PANTS! BUT YOU KNOW KERRY'S NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH THAT (BLEEP). KERRY'S GOING TO FIRE BACK, HE'S GOING TO BE, LIKE, WHILST YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF ME HAS SOME VALIDITY, I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT, ALTHOUGH MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD YOUR FORESKIN REMOVED, WHETHER IT BE FOR CULTURAL OR RELIGIOUS CUSTOM, I AM OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PERFORMED THAT PROCEDURE, IN THEIR CARELESSNESS, WHETHER THROUGH HASTE OR INTENT, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE LENGTH OF YOUR PENIS! BOOM! (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THERE WE GO. SO THE BOMBING HAS BEGUN. THE COALITION HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED. IT'S TIME TO FOCUS 100% ON ATTACKING I.S.I.S.
AT THE SAME TIME U.S. JETS WERE ATTACKING I.S.I.S. TARGETS, THEY ALSO FLEW A NUMBER OF MISSIONS AGAINST A DIFFERENT TERRORIST GROUP KNOWN AS KHORASAN.
Jon: WAIT. WHO THE WHAT NOW? WAIT? WHO? KHORASAN -- WE JUST DECIDED THAT SO LONG AS WE'RE ATTACKING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE'RE GOING TO SWING BY AND BOMB THESE OTHER CATS TOO SO WE COULD WHAT, USE THE BOMB-POOLING LANE? WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHO IS KHORASAN GROUP?
KHORASAN IS A SHADOWY GROUP OF ABOUT 50 VETERAN AL QAEDA FIGHTERS FROM AFGHANISTAN WHO THE U.S., AS ADMIRAL KIRBY SAYS, CONSIDERS FAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN I.S.I.S.
Jon: WHAT THE -- WHAT THE (BLEEP)? YOU JUST TOLD US I.S.I.S. WAS LIKE IF GODZILLA AND THE DEVIL (BLEEP) ON A BED OF EBOLA. WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN I.S.I.S.? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OH, I.S.I.S. IS THE WORST THING WE'VE EVER BUT THIS NEW MAKES I.S.I.S. SEEM NICEST. YOU WISH THIS GROUP WERE AS NICE AS I.S.I.S.!
OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF FABRICATING CUTTING EDGE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, INSIDE TOOTHPASTE TUBES OR WITH CLOTHING DIPPED IN LIQUID EXPLOSIVES THAT COULD EXPLODE ON AN AIRPLANE AND NOT BE DETECTED.
Jon: NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FLY NAKED AND FLUSHED WITH TARTAR. AND WITH AN AGING HEAD, AN ODDLY ANACHRONISTIC PUBESCENT BODY. KIND OF A WEIRD LOOK. ALL RIGHT WHITE HOUSE. CAN WE AT LEAST ADMIT THAT WE ARE AT WAR?
NOT JUST A COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATION, NOT JUST POLICE ACTION. IT'S A WAR.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY THAT WILL APPLY TO THIS SITUATION THAT WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IN OTHER PLACES.
Jon: SUCCESSFULLY? WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT. FOR MORE, WE GO TO OUR SENIOR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JESSICA! YOU HEARD THAT DESCRIPTION THERE. JESSICA, HOW IS THIS NOT A WAR?
HEY, WAIT, WAR? JON, YOU HEARD THE MAN! IT'S A COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY INVOLVING OPEN AND DECLARED ARMED CONFLICT. OKAY?
Jon: RIGHT!
RIGHT.
Jon: THAT IS THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF WAR!
WAIT, JON, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DICTIONARIES, OKAY? I'M JUST QUOTING A REFERENCE BOOK DETAILING THE MEANINGS OF WORDS LISTED IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.
Jon: NO, THAT'S A DICTIONARY.
SO BACK OFF.
Jon: THAT'S JUST, ALL RIGHT.
WHAT?
Jon: WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THIS KHORASAN GROUP?
KHORASAN GROUP? JON, THEY ARE LIKE SO THIS MORNING.
Jon: WHAT?
THE REAL THREAT NOW IS FROM A NEWER ORGANIZATION THAT AS OF LIKE FIVE HOURS AGO HAS BROKEN AWAY FROM KHORASAN. THEY CALL THEMSELVES AL-KILL YA ALL.
Jon: AL-KILL YA -- Y'ALL?
YA ALL, JON.
Jon: YA ALL?
IT'S ARABIC FOR YOU ALL.
Jon: OH.
AND JON, THEY'RE NOT PLAYING WITH TOOTHPASTE AND CLOTHING. THEY'RE HITTING AMERICA WHERE IT HURTS, EXPLODING STARBUCKS GIFT CARDS. AND JON, I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT IT'S PUMPKIN LATE SEASON!
Jon: THOSE MONSTERS. MONSTERS!
I KNOW, PURE EVIL! PURE EVIL. PLUS, JON, I'M HEARING THAT THEY CAN DETONATE (BLEEP) WITH THEIR MINDS, JON!
Jon: WITH THEIR MINDS? WELL, NOW I'M GROWING A LITTLE MORE SKEPTICAL.
WHAT WHY? IT'S TRUE, JON, THEY'RE HARD CORE AND THEY'RE NOT HALF AS SCARY AS AL-FA-AK-U-UP.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU --?
WHAT?
Jon: ARE YOU SAYING -- WHAT DID YOU?
WHAT, JON? I'M SAYING AL-FA-AK-U-UP.
Jon: WHAT? AL-FA-AK-U-UP?
YEAH.
Jon: IS THAT A NEW GROUP?
YEAH.
Jon: WHO ARE THEY?  >>THEY'RE A BREAK AWAY BROTHER SISTER DUO FROM AL-KILL-YA-ALL.
Jon: SO, SO AL-FA-AK-U-UP SPLIT OFF FROM AL-KILL-YA-ALL BUT NOW AL-FA-AK-U-UP IS THE ULTIMATE TERROR GROUP.
WAIT, WAIT, ACTUALLY, JON, THEY'RE THE PENULTIMATE.
Jon: WHAT?
BECAUSE JUST AS YOU WERE TALKING A NEW TERRORIST GROUP JUST FORMED WITH ONE MEMBER EACH FROM I.S.I.S., AL-NUSRA, AL QAEDA, HAMAS, ONE DIRECTION AND THE ZETAS DRUG CARTEL.
Jon: A SUPERGROUP UH?
YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: A SUPERGROUP?
UH-HUH! THE SUPERIST.
Jon: WHAT'S THEIR JAM.
THEY LIKE TO HIJACK PLANES, JON, AND TAKE THEM TO CUBA.
Jon: WHAT?
THEY'RE REAL KICKING IT OLD SCHOOL, JON.
Jon: THEY REALLY ARE.
VERY VINTAGE.
Jon: JESSICA, I THINK THE REAL TAKEAWAY FROM ALL OF THIS IS WE'RE GOING TO BE AT WAR FOREVER, AREN'T WE?
OH, NO, NO, NO, NOT FOREVER, JUST AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WILL CONTINUE INTO ETERNITY.
Jon: THANK YOU, JESSICA. JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
