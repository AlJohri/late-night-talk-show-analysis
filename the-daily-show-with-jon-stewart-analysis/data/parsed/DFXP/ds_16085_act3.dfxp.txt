Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTOR, HIS NEW FILM WHICH HE DIRECTED, WROTE  AND STARRED IN IS CALLED LARRY LARRY -- "LARRY CROWNE."
MY NAME IS MISS TAINOT, T-A-I-N-O-T, NOT TIE-NOT. EACH OF YOU WILL ADDRESS THE CLASS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND TELL US SOMETHING THAT YOU  ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO.
MS. TIE-NOT? TAY-NOT? TAEBO?
REALLY?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM TOM HANKS. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU, BUDDY. HOW YOU DOING?
THANK YOU.
SOAK IT IN. SOAK IT IN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: YOU LOOK VERY SHARP, VERY DAPPER.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. JON JON THIS MOVIE, THIS MOVIE, TELL ME ABOUT... YOU LOOK VERY GOOD.
ARE YOU EVER CUTTING TO CAMERA THREE? IF YOU'RE NOT, [BLEEPED] THE TIE. I DON'T CARE.
Jon: GIVE HIM THREE, CHUCK. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. OH, NO, THAT'S NOT WORKING. CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING, THOUGH? I LIKE IT, THOUGH. IT HAS A CERTAIN... THERE'S A DEBONAIR QUALITY TO IT. YOU DON'T LOOK DISHEVELED. NO MATTER WHAT I DO, I LOOK DISHEVELED. YOU LOOK VERY SHARP.
TOMMY CLEANS UP GOOD.
Jon: TOMMY DOES CLEAN UP GOOD. TELL ME ABOUT THIS "LARRY CROWNE." IT SEEMS LIKE A "STELLA GETS HER  GROOVE BACK" FOR MIDDLE-AGED WHITE GUYS. [LAUGHTER] CHEW ON THAT. CHEW ON THAT.
I'M GOING TO.
Jon: ENJOY THAT ONE.
IT STARTED OFF GOING FOR THAT TARGET AUDIENCE, AS A MATTER OF FACT. I FIND THE MIDDLE-AGED WHITE GUYS ARE NOT REPRESENTED ENOUGH IN TODAY'S AMERICAN MEDIA. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THEY ARE VICTIMS IN MANY RESPECTS.
THEY ARE INDEED UNDERLINGS.
Jon: THEY ARE UNDERLINGS. TELL ME ABOUT THIS JULIA ROBERTS. SHE SEEMS TO HAVE A FEW...
SHE'S A NUT. SHE'S AN ABSOLUTE COOK. SHE'S A DREAM BOAT, SHE SMELLS, MMM, FANTASTIC. I JUST DID A MARTY SHORT, THERE MMM.
Jon: WHO IS THE BEST SMELLING, IN YOUR EXPERIENCE.
YES.
Jon: AND I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, THE BEST-SMELLING ACTOR.
BEST-SMELLING ACTOR OR ACTRESS?
I GOT IT. I GOT IT. I AM GOING TO SAY KEVIN BACON. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE ON "APOLLO 13" WE WERE REALLY JAMMED IN, JAMMED IN.
Jon: IS THERE A SAVORY QUALITY TO THAT? IS THERE A BACONNESQUE, IF YOU WILL, BECAUSE THAT IS... IS THAT WHERE YOU WERE GOING?
NO, NO, I THINK HE SMELLS LIKE A LITTLE MIX OF BABY POWDER AND LISTERINE.
Jon: THAT'S A LOT OF HYGIENE.
THAT IS A LOT OF HYGIENE.
Jon: DO YOU GET TO CHOOSE, YOU'VE WORKED WITH JULIA ROBERTS BEFORE. DO YOU SAY TO YOURSELF, I'M GOING TO BE ON LOCATION FOR... HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DO A MOVIE?
THIS TOOK ABOUT NINE WEEKS, BUT WE SHOT IT IN THE FAMILY IN LOS ANGELES, SO NOT EXACTLY A LOCATION. SO EVERYONE WENT HOME EVERY NIGHT.
Jon: IT ALMOST DOESN'T EVEN MATTER THEN.
BUT STILL, THERE IS AN ASPECT OF WHO DO YOU WANT TO SEE EVERY DAY. YOU WANT TO SEE PEOPLE THAT MAKE YOU LAUGH. MAYBE YOU MEET THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE FIRST DAY OF SHOOTING OR MAYBE YOU'VE DONE  OTHER FILMS WITH THEM.
Jon: YOU WROTE THIS, YOU CO-WROTE THIS...
CO-WROTE THIS WITH NIA VARDALOS.
Jon: YOU WERE THE BOSS. YOU MADE THE COSTUMES.
I DID NOT MAKE THE COSTUMES.
Jon: YOU COOKED EVERYONE FETA CHEESE.
THERE WERE SOME DAYS I HAD THE CROCK POT ON THE BACK OF THE CAMPER. THIS IS TRUE. YOU START OFF IN A LONG TIME AGO AND YOU JUST PUT THAT DREAM TEAM TOGETHER, AND YOU EXAMINE THE  SCENE THAT IS STUCK INSIDE. YOU'LL HATE IT.
Jon: IS TOM HANKS CALLS SOMEBODY, AND I'M GOING TO TALK  ABOUT YOU IN THE THIRD PERSON, DO YOU EVER FEEL THE STING OF A REJECTED PHONE CALL? IF YOU CALL SOMEBODY UP AND GO, I WANT YOU TO DO THIS AND THEY'RE LIKE, NO?
NO, NO, NO. YOU START WITH A CAVEAT RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THE FIRST THING YOU DO... YOU CAN SAY, NO YOU CAN SAY, NO IT WILL NOT HURT MY FEELINGS. IT WILL HURT MY FEELINGS. WILL NOT, BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DON'T DO IT. IT'S JUST THE WAY IT WORKS.
Jon: AND YOU'LL GO WITH THE DIRECT PHONE CALL YOURSELF?
NO, THE LAST THING...
Jon: IS THAT THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.
THE WORST THING IS WHEN THEY SAY, I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO  DO IT UNLESS YOU GIVE HIM A CALL.
Jon: IT'S ALL ON YOU.
THAT'S LIKE DISASTER.
Jon: THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP GUEST STARRING ON "THE NANNY."
HERE'S THE WEIRD THING, IT DOES TOTALLY WORK.
Jon: IT REALLY DOES. ONE DAY I'M IN MY OFFICE AND I HEAR [AS FRAN DRESSER] "HELLO." NANNY FEIN?
YOU'RE LIKE, I'D LOVE TO DO THIS BUT IT BUMPS WITH THIS  MOVIE WE'RE DOING ALREADY. IN WHAT WAY? WELL, A GUY PUTS ON CLOTHES AND DRIVES TO A THING AND THIS DEAL HAPPENS, SO I WISH I COULD.
Jon: I WERE I COULD BUT I CAN'T.
YOU ESCAPE WITH YOUR LIFE.
Jon: FOR YOU NOW, THIS IS THIS THE PINNACLE, FROM NOW ON IT'S TOM HANKS... YOU JUST  BECOME NOT JUST "STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK" BUT THE TYLER PERRY  OF MIDDLE-AGED WHITE GUYS. TOM HANKS PRESENTS.
I'VE DONE MY TIME IN THE DRESS, SO MAYBE I CAN ACTUALLY... I DON'T KNOW IF THE  KIDS REMEMBER THAT BACK BEFORE HIGH-DEF IF YOU GO BACK ON THE YOUTUBE YOU'LL FIND ME IN THE  BOSOM BUDDY, WHICH STARTED IT ALL. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ACTUALLY, I LOOK AT THE ACTORS DURING THE MOVIE, THEY ARE HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME, SITTING  OVER THERE LAUGHING, NOT WORKING, NOT FIGURING OUT THE SHOTS, NOT FINDING OUT WHAT YOU  CAN'T, DO NOT HAVING TO ARGUE WITH SOMEONE ON THE PHONE AT THE END OF THE DAY. THEY'RE HAVING FUN AND I USED TO BE ONE OF THEM. I'M NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU WILL NEVER EVER NOT BE ADORABLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
GOD BLESS YOU, SIR.
Jon: "LARRY CROWNE" IN THEATERS ON FRIDAY.
THAT'S THE END OF THE THIRD SEGMENT?
Jon: YES.
