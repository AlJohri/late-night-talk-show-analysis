Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE FRONT MAN OF THE FOO FIGHTERS. HIS HBO SERIES WHICH HE CREATED AND DIRECTED IS CALLED "FOO FIGHTERS, SONIC HIGHWAYS."
I LOOKED AT MY INTERVIEW WITH STEVE LIKE THE MESSAGE OF THIS ENTIRE PROJECT. WE'RE ALL CONNECTED BY SOMETHING. MAYBE IT'S A RIVER THAT RUNS UNDERGROUND. MAYBE IT'S WOODY GUTHRIE. MAYBE IT'S CHUCK D. WHATEVER. THAT CONVERSATION BECAME MY GOAL. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MUSIC. BUT I WANT TO GET TO THIS.
Jon: NICE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, DAVE GROHL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU GOOD?
THANKS.
I KNOW IT'S HARD. I KNOW IT'S HARD.
IT'S HARD BEING THIS OLD.
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING.
HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: I'M GOOD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I LOVE THIS.
Jon: THIS SERIES IS, IT'S -- IT'S JUST WONDERFUL.
THANKS.
Jon: IT'S WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
Jon: IT'S, AND IT'S OLD SCHOOL BUT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY WITHOUT THAT PATINA OF KIND OF GOOFY NOSTALGIA BUT OF WHAT MADE THE MUSIC IN THE CITIES YOU WENT TO SO VITAL. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU AVOIDED THAT TRAP BUT YOU DID.
WELL, YOU KNOW PART OF THE -- PART OF THE IDEA OR THE INTENTION WAS TO INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION OF MUSICIANS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MUSIC JUST AS MUCH AS WE DID. SO AS MUCH AS -- AS MUCH AS I WAS DIGGING INTO THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN MUSIC. I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD INSPIRE KIDS TODAY TO WANT TO CONTINUE AND DO THE SAME THING BY SHOWING THESE STORIES THAT ARE TOTALLY HUMAN. YOU KNOW. LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT ANY OF WHAT -- ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. IT'S AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE THEY WERE INSPIRED TO FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS AND MAKE SOMETHING OF IT. WHETHER IT'S BUDDY GUY OR RICK NIELSEN OR CHUCK D OR IAN MACKAYE OR WHATEVER IT IS AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE THEY CAUGHT THAT SPARK. AND THEY WERE LIKE, OKAY THIS IS WHAT -- THIS IS ME AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
Jon: WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SO GOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU CAPTURED IS IN EACH OF THOSE INTERACTIONS, IN EACH OF THOSE CITIES THERE IS A MOMENT WHERE YOU ARE WITH THEM, WHERE YOU FEEL THAT SPARK. NOT ONLY IS IT ABOUT EXPLORING IT BUT YOU FEEL THAT ELECTRICITY. THERE IS A MOMENT. AND MAYBE IT IS FOR MUSICIANS. THAT FEELING OF WHEN YOU'RE CONNECTED ON THE ARTISTIC LEVEL AND SUDDENLY IT STARTS TO CRACKLE.
YEAH, WELL, A LOT OF THE -- ALSO, LIKE I INTERVIEWED ABOUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE.
Jon: YEAH.
AND WHEN I WOULD SIT DOWN TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE, I DIDN'T HAVE QUESTIONS.
Jon: WHAT.
I DIDN'T HOLD QUESTIONS IN MY HAND.
Jon: YOU THINK I DO THAT.
YEAH -- THINK -- [LAUGHING]
Jon: I'M LIKE YOU, MAN! I'M [BEEP] ROCK-N-ROLL.
YEAH, I KNOW YOU ARE. I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jon: YEAH.
BUT THEY BECAME, THEY WERE CONVERSATIONS THAT THEN TURNED INTO LESSONS BECAUSE THERE WERE THINGS THAT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW AND SO WHEN I WOULD TALKED TO SOMEONE ABOUT THE BLUES OR JAZZ OR COUNTRY, OR NASHVILLE.
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE WERE JUST THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW. AND I WOULD SORT OF IMAGINE MYSELF AS THE VIEWER. BECAUSE THEY WOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD TOTALLY BLOW ME AWAY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I WOULD JUST THINK, OKAY I HAVE TO USE THAT. BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, YOU KNOW.
Jon: TURNING THAT INTO THE CREATIVE PROCESS. WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL HERE AS WELL, SO IN TERMS OF SONG WRITING. SO, I'M SURE YOU HAVE IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD AND THEY'RE FRAGMENTS OF IDEAS AND MELODIES AND THINGS. BUT YOU'RE SAVING THE LYRICS IN THESE CITIES FOR WHEN YOU'RE, RIGHT BEFORE YOU'RE ABOUT TO RECORD.
YEAH. SO BASICALLY WHAT WE DID IS WE WENT TO EACH CITY FOR SIX DAYS.
Jon: RIGHT.
FIRST DAY WE'D LOAD IN ALL THE EQUIPMENT FIRST DAY. THE NEXT DAY WE'D GET ALL THE MICROPHONES UP,  WE'D START RECORDING. BY THE END OF THAT DAY WE'D HAVE A DRUM TRACK AND SOME GUITAR STUFF. AND THEN AT NIGHT I WOULD GO INTERVIEW SOMEONE. AND THEN THE NEXT DAY, DO SOME MORE GUITAR STUFF, PERCUSSION. THEN I'D GO INTERVIEW PEOPLE. I DID THAT FOR FOUR DAYS. AND THEN ON THE FIFTH DAY I TAKE ALL OF THOSE TRANSCRIPTS HOME. AND I'D SIT DOWN, AND I'D PICK OUT WORDS AND SENTENCES AND PHRASES AND I'D PUT THEM ON THIS SIDE OF MY JOURNAL. AND ON THIS SIDE OF THE JOURNAL I HAD AN OUTLINE OF THE SONG.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND I WOULD JUST CUT AND PASTE. BECAUSE THE IDEA IS THAT THE FINALE OF EACH EPISODE IS A PERFORMANCE OF THE SONG THAT YOU'VE SEEN US PUTTING TOGETHER.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND WE PERFORM THE SONG. YOU SEE THE LYRICS ON SCREEN. AND YOU RECOGNIZE ALL OF THESE LYRICS FROM REFERENCES THAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD IN THE EPISODE.
Jon: RIGHT. NO, NO, IT'S A REMARKABLE. I DIDN'T REALIZE THE PROCESS WAS SIX DAYS. I'M JUST GONNA, ON THE SEVEN DAY I'M GOING TO ASSUME YOU RESTED. [LAUGHING] [ APPLAUSE ] AND THE RESPECT AND LOVE. YOU KNOW, IT MADE ME YEARN FOR THAT TYPE OF CAMARADERIE. COMEDIANS HAVE A CAMARADERIE AND YOU GO IN. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY NECESSARILY HAVE THOSE TYPES OF REGIONAL FLAVORS OR THE TYPES OF WITHIN MUSIC THAT THE SHARING OF INFLUENCES. YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE LIKE YEAH, I SAT DOWN WITH THE PROP GUY. YOU KNOW, I'M A CARLIN GUY. AND I, AND WE CAME UP WITH SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. LIKE THAT ABILITY TO COLLABORATE SEEMS SO INVITING AND SO EXCITING.
WELL COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT'S DIFFERENT NOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO INTER CONNECTED. IT USED TO BE THAT THESE PLACES WERE ISOLATED SOMEWHAT. THAT YOU WOULD HAVE REGIONAL SOUNDS, YOU KNOW. THERE WERE REASONS WHY JAZZ COMES FROM NEW ORLEANS. AND WHY THE BLUES MADE IT'S WAY TO CHICAGO, AND WHY NASHVILLE BECAME A COUNTRY CAPITAL. AND WHY ALL OF THE MUSIC FROM SEATTLE IS SO DEPRESSING.
Jon: YEAH, YOUR MAP IS ALL [BEEP] UP, BY THE WAY.
YEAH, I DON'T.
Jon: IS THAT --
DID I DO THAT RIGHT?
Jon: I THINK THAT WAS NEW ZEALAND.
THAT'S ALASKA.
Jon: THAT WAS ALASKA.
BUT NOW EVERYTHING IS SO INTER CONNECTED THAT ALL OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BECOME SORT OF ONE BIG COMMUNITY. AND ONE THING THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING THINGS ABOUT PLAYING MUSIC IS DOING IT WITH OTHER PEOPLE. AND COMMUNITIES SUPPORT EACH OTHER, LIKE THE PUNK ROCK COMMUNITY WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
Jon: YEAH.
IT'S LIKE, IT WAS LIKE YOU AND YOUR BUDDY. AND YOU NEVER REALLY IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD LEAVE YOUR CITY OR YOUR LOCAL CLUB. IT WAS JUST LIKE YOUR PALS. AND YOU DID IT. AND YOU HAD YOUR BAND PLAY WITH YOU. AND YOU WOULD GO PLAY AT YOUR FRIEND'S CLUB. I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT, MIGHT IMAGINE THESE DAYS THAT YOU DON'T NEED THAT. THAT YOU CAN JUST DO IT ON YOUR OWN. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, I THINK, TO WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE. BECAUSE YOU GET INSPIRED BY THEM. THEY PUSH YOU TO DO OTHER THINGS.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THAT SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT.
Jon: AND I THINK THAT, BOY THAT COMES THROUGH ACES IN THE WHOLE PROGRAM. IT'S GREAT. AND THE NICE PART IS, IT'S EIGHT CITIES NOW.
YEAH.
Jon: AND THERE IS MORE THAN THAT, SO I ASSUME THERE'S A SEASON TWO THAT WILL GO --
THERE MIGHT BE A SEASON TWO.
Jon: I THINK I WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH. THE FINALE OF "SONIC HIGHWAYS" PREMIERES FRIDAY AT AT 11:00 P.M. ON HBO. THE ALBUM "SONIC HIGHWAYS" IS ON SALE NOW. DAVE, ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOU. DAVE GROHL.
