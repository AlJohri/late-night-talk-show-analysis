FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS, WE'RE VERY EXCITED FOR OUR GUEST TONIGHT MALALA YOUSAFZAI. YOU REMEMBER? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE IS THE GIRL WHO WAS ATTACKED BY THE TALIBAN, SHOT MERELY FOR SPEAKING OUT ABOUT A GIRLS RIGHT TO EDUCATION. SHE'S HERE TONIGHT AT 11:00 P.M. ON A SCHOOL NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE SHE IS IRRESPONSIBLE. [ LAUGHTER ] MALALA IS ON THE SHOW AND I'M TOTALLY FAN GIRLING! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE TAUGHT ME WHAT THAT IS. ME THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS FAN GIRLING ABOUT SOMETHING AND I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. THEY EXPLAINED IT TO ME. YOU FAN GIRL HARD OR YOU DON'T. AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO PUT YOUR HANDS LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE'S ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. NOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS ANOTHER REASON I'M EXCITED. I'M NOT LEADING OFF WITH THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. NOT DOING IT. TIRED OF IT. SWITCHING IT UP. EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE THING GETTING UNDER MY SKIN. THERE'S A REPUBLICAN LACK OF WHAT I LIKE TO CALL OWNERSHIP OVER THE CURRENT PREDICAMENT.
THIS IS HARRY REID'S SHUTDOWN. THIS IS NOT THE REPUBLICAN SHUTDOWN. THIS IS HARRY REID'S AND BARACK OBAMA'S SHUTDOWN.
DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO BUDGE.
NO WILLINGNESS AT ALL TO COMPROMISE.
THE PRESIDENT WON'T NEGOTIATE.
Jon: IT'S NOT THEIR SHURTDOWN. IS THEIR NAME ON THE SHUTDOWN? THEY DIDN'T DO IT. OJ DID IT. I THINK OJ DID IT. IF YOU GLOVE DOESN'T FIT YOU MUST -- REMEMBER THE CHASE WITH THE CAR? [LAUGHTER] PARTY OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AIN'T TAKING NONE.
SO LISTEN, HERE IS THE PROOF ONCE AND FOR ALL. SNIFFLES MAGILACUTY HERE, JOHN BOEHNER SAT DOWN WITH GEORGEHN STEPHANOPOLUS WHO ASKED HIM ABOUT A CLAIM HARRY REID IS MAKING.
HE SAID PUBLICLY THAT YOU CAME TO HIM IN JULY AND OFFERED TO PASS A CLEAN GOVERNMENT FUNDING RESOLUTION, NO OBAMACARE AMENDMENTS. IT WAS $70 BILLION BELOW WHAT THE SENATE WANTED, THEY ACCEPTED AND YOU'VE RENEGED ON THAT OFFER.
CLEARLY THERE WAS A CONVERSATION ABOUT DOING THIS.
SEVERAL.
SEVERAL.
AND YOU OFFERED A CLEAN RESOLUTION.
I AND MY MEMBERS DECIDED THAT THE THREAT OF OBAMACARE AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS SO IMPORTANT IT WAS TIME TO TAKE A STAND AND WE TOOK A STAND.
Jon: DID YOU -- DID YOU (bleep) HEAR THAT? CAN WE STOP HAVING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT IT? OH WHICH SIDE WILL BLINK? THEY HAD A DEAL BUT -- OBAMACARE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE DECIDED TO TAKE A STAND. DO YOU THINK OBAMACARE IS A BIG ENOUGH THREAT TO THE COUNTRY YOU NEED TO SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT OVER IT. FINE, OWN IT. DON'T FART AND POINT AT THE DOG! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DID YOU DO THAT? DID YOU --? GOOD BOY. I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M GOING TO MOVE ON. I'M GOING TO DO A DIFFERENT STORY. ANY STORY. I KNOW WHAT I'LL DO. I'LL USE MY WHEEL OF HAPPY STORIES. WE DON'T HARDLY EVER USE IT BUT IT'S ALWAYS -- [LAUGHTER] OH, MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S --  WE NEVER USE IT BUT IT'S ALWAYS UNDER HERE APPARENTLY. LOOK AT ALL THESE FUN STORIES. DONALD TRUMP HAS LARYNGITIS FULL FRONTAL CLOONEY. LET'S SPIN IT AND SEE WHAT WE GET. HOLD ON. MYSTERY STORY! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT FUN -- OH, MY GOD! [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ONE METATARSAL DOWN. FINE, WHAT IS THE HAPPY NEWS FROM SYRIA.
A TEAM OF INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS HIT THE ROAD IN DAMASCUS WEDNESDAY DEPLOYED TO DESTROY BASHAR AL ASSAD'SED TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS. AN ESTIMATED 7,000 TON CHEMICAL ARSENAL IS AT THE CENTER OF INTERNATIONAL CONTENTION. THE TEAM HAS NINE MONTHS TO ELIMINATE IT ALL.
Jon: BECAUSE THE WHOLE TEAM IS PREGNANT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY DO THEY HAVE NINE -- WHAT A WEIRD ARBITRARY NUMBER. HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO ELIMINATE SYRIA'S CHEMICAL ARSENAL. THEY HAVE A REASONABLY HIGH TECH REMOVAL WEAPON. THEY SPEND ALL THIS MONEY TO MAKE THEM I'M SURE WE'RE EQUALLY SOPHISTICATED UNMAKING THEM.
THEY ARE USING BLOW TORCHES TO DESTROY WARHEADS AND BOMBS.
Jon: WHAT IS IN THESE CRAZY THINGS? WOW, IF YOU ARE DOING IT ON THE CHEAP WHY NOT HAVE THE HUMAN WRECKING BALLS TAKE CARE IT.
WITH HIS HEAD AND MY SHOULDER RAM WE --
HELP THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA.
WE'RE GOING TO TEAR APART THIS.
CHEMICAL WEAPON.
WITH EVERY INCH OF OUR BODY.
WE'RE GOING TO USE SCIENCE.
TO PREVENT ASSAD FROM GASSING CIVILIANS.
WE ARE.
UNITED NATIONS.
WRECKING BALL.
Jon: ISN'T THAT NICE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY, THE BRAVE CHEMICAL WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF HITTING THEMSELVES WITH A HAMMER.
THEY FACE GRAVE RISKS WORKING IN SYRIA. JUST LAST MONTH A U.N. CONVOY CAME UNDER SNIPER FIRE. THERE'S NO CONFIRMATION OF WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER.
Jon: YES, BECAUSE WHAT IS A BETTER SYMBOL OF SAFETY THAN A TROJAN WITH A HOLE ON IT. FOR MORE ON SYRIA WE GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
HI, JON.
Jon: DO THEY HAVE YOU THERE? YOU ARE DESTROYING CHEMICAL WEAPONS THERE?
NO, NO THIS IS MY HALLOWEEN COSTUME I'M A SEXY JESSIE PINKMAN.
Jon: YOU THINK HE'S SEXY?
VERY.
Jon: WHY DID YOU GO TO SYRIA TO GET A BREAKING BAD COSTUME?
THEY WERE SOLD OUT EVERYWHERE ELSE.
Jon: HOW ARE THINGS GOING?
PRETTY ROUGH, JON. SOMEONE TOLD THE LOCALS I'M FROM AMERICA. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE (bleep) I'M GETTING AROUND HERE.
Jon: YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH THE FOREIGN POLICY.
NOT THE FOREIGN POLICY THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THE SYRIANS THINK WE'RE IDIOTS.
Jon: WE'RE IDIOTS?
YEAH.
Jon: THEY ARE HARDLY IN A POSITION TO JUDGE US. SYRIA IS NOT EXACTLY A MODEL SOCIETY THESE DAYS.
YEAH, BUT GUESS WHAT? EVEN WITH THE WHOLE COUNTRY TORN EVAPART WITH BRUTAL FACTIONALORN VIOLENCE, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT PAID ALL ITS BILLS AND WORKERS WAGES. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT (bleep)? THE MEMORIAL I'M SURE THEY ARE BUILDING TO THIS WAR IS OPEN RIGHT NOW. (bleep).
Jon: WOW. SO THEIR GOVERNMENT IS OPEN. BUT -- BUT -- BUT ASSAD IS STILL A MURDEROUS DICTATOR.
TRUE. BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME TODAY, JON?
Jon: WAIT, WHAT HE SAID TO YOU?
YEAH, THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA SAID TO ME TODAY WHILE WE WERE EATING HE SAID WHAT IS UP WITH THAT TED CRUZ GUY? SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A WHACK JOB.
Jon: REALLY. ASSAD SAID THAT TO YOU? TOTALLY.
Jon: DID YOU DID YOU SAY TO ASSAD?
WHAT (bleep) AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY YOU JUST NOD AND FINISH YOUR SUSHI. >>SO EVEN BASHAR AL ASSAD THINKS THE SHUTDOWN GOES TO FAR. YEAH,
