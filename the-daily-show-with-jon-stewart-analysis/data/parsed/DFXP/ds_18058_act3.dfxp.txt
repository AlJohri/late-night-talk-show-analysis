[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS THE SPECIAL  INSPECTOR GENERAL IN CHARGE OF  OVERSIGHT OF THE TARP PROGRAM. CURRENTLY A FELLOW AT THE NEW  YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL YOU LAUGH  HIS BOOK IS CALLED "BAILOUT." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  NEIL BAROFSKY. SIR, HOW ARE YOU? THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL I'M RANGE  RIX THE BOOK IS CALLED  "BAILOUT."  I'VE READ AT LEAST TEN OF THIS TYPE OF INSIDER FINANCIAL. I DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD DO IT  IN A WITTY AND ENTERTAINING  FASHION. I WISH I HAD KNOWN THIS NINE  BOOKS AGO. [LAUGHTER] IT'S REALLY GOOD AND REALLY  ENTERTAINING AND REALLY ALLOWS  TO YOU SEE THE HUMAN WORLD THAT YOU WERE TRAPPED IN WHEN YOU  WERE OVERSEEING TARP.
I WAS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR  FOR EIGHT YEARS. I GOT TAPPED TO DO THIS JOB. A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT GETTING  APOINTED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH WHICH WAS THE CRAZIEST  THING EVER. I WENT DOWN WITH MY GOOD FRIEND  WHO WAS ALSO A PROSECUTOR. WE WENT INTO THIS ALIEN WORLD OF  WASHINGTON WHERE EVERYTHING WAS  UPSIDE DOWN. WE CAME FROM A CULTURE WHERE  DOING THE RIGHT THING, PUTTING  BAD GUYS IN JAIL, WAS WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. WE WE WENT TO A CULTURE WHERE  EVERYBODY WAS CONCERNED ABOUT  LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES, THE NEXT NEWSPAPER REPORT RATHER  THAN THE FINANCIAL MELTDOWN WE  JUST WALKED INTO.
Jon: THE CRAZY PART -- WE  SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT  THEORIES OF WHAT MIGHT WORK AND WHAT MIGHT NOT. WHAT WE DON'T REALIZE BEHIND THE  SCENES ITS PLANS AND PROGRAMS  ARE EXECUTED BY HIGH SCHOOL KIDS AND I SAY THAT NOT TRYING TO  DENIGRATE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. [LAUGHTER] THE AMOUNT OF HEADY PARDON THE  YIDDISH (bleep) YOU HAVE TO  DEAL WITH. THE FIRST MEETING YOU HAD WITH  ALLISON.
HERB.
Jon: WHERE HE EXPLAINS HOW  YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.
THAT WASN'T HIM. THAT WAS THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT  SECRETARY GENERAL ERIC. THEY ALL GAVE ME THE SAME IDEA  THAT THE IDEA IS TO HAVE THAT  PERFECT GOLDIE LOCKS MINIMUM. DON'T BE TOO -- A LAPDOG WHICH  WAS TOO PLAYING GOLF ON THE  WEEKENDS WITH HANK PAULSON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE HANK HAS  SORT OF A DISTENDED PINKY SO  THAT WASN'T AN ISSUE.
Jon: THERE'S THE INSIDE  DIRT ON THE FORMER TREASURY  SECRETARY.
DON'T BE TOO AGGRESSIVE BEING  A JUNKYARD DOG. DON'T MAKE TOO MANY WAVES. DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH WAVES BUT  DON'T APPEAR TOO COMFORTABLE. BEHIND ALL THIS, I FIRST HEARD  IT I WAS LIKE WAS THIS SOUNDS  REASONABLE. THEY WERE SAYING THE BEST WAY TO  KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, KEEP YOUR  BUDGET COMING AND NOT ROCKING THE BOAT TOO MUCH WHICH IS THE  BEST PATH TO GETTING A HIGHER,  BETTER JOB IN WASHINGTON THAT'S SORT THE WAY THE TOWN WORKS  JORCHG IT'S GO ALONG OR GET  ALONG. IT TURNS INTO A WEIRD ALMOST  BRAZIL LIKE ENVIRONMENT WHERE  YOU ARE BASICALLY -- YOU CAN'T GIVE HOMEOWNERS MONEY FOR THEIR  MORTGAGE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THAT  WOULD CREATE MORAL HAZARD WHILE YOU ARE HANDING TRILLIONS TO  BANKS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BIG  TO GO AFTER. THIS IS THE ONE OF CORE  IDEOLOGICAL THINGS WE RAN INTO. WHEN IT CAME TO THE BANKS  ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WAS ON  THE TABLE. SAVING THE BANKS OF PRIORITY  ONE, TWO AND THREE. TARP WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP  HOMEOWNERS. IT WAS SUPPOSED SPO HELP ALMOST  4 MILLION PEOPLE STAY THEIR  HOMES. THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR NOT DOING  THE RIGHT THING, NOT REDUCING  PRINCIPLE, NOT FULFILLING THE  PROMISE. WE CAN'T HELP AN UNDESERVING  HOMEOWNER. THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE. THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT  RODE THIS COUNTRY INTO THE  DITCH, THE UNEMPLOYMENT -- THAT'S NOT WHAT GET THEMES  MONEY. LET'S MAKE SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO  PAY THEIR BILLIONS IN BONUSES  BECAUSE THAT MIGHT UPSET THE  SYSTEM. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE DOUBLE  STANDARD.
Jon: IT'S A BIZARRE WAY OF  TREATING -- THE PEOPLE CREATED  THE CRISIS HAVE TO BE CODDLED BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY  MIGHT GO OFF AGAIN. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY MIGHT  THROW THE ECONOMY OVER THE CLIFF  AGAIN. IT'S LIKE A SPOILED CHILD. WHAT IF WE CHARGE YOU NO  INTEREST. [ LAUGHTER ] AND YOU COULD SELL IT BACK TO US  FOR 5%. WE DON'T CARE. DON'T HURT US AGAIN.
A LOT OF BANKS DID AND STILL  DO HOLD A GUN TO THEIR HEAD. THEY HOLD US HOSTAGE. IF YOU BRING CRIMINAL CHARGES  AGAINST THEM YOU BRING THEM DOWN  AND THAT BRINGS DOWN THE SYSTEM. YOU CAN'T GET TOO TOUGH WITH  THEM. YOU CAN'T BREAK THEM UP BECAUSE  IT TEARS DOWN ITS SYSTEM. IT'S ALL JUST FIVES NOT THAT  THERL NECESSARILY TRUE BECAUSE  IT'S PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO AND KEEPING THEIR POLITICAL  POWER WHICH IS SO STRONG IN  WASHINGTON IN TACT.
Jon: CAN YOU STICK AROUND  FOR A LITTLE BIT? I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT  ASPECT OF IT AT LEAST BEHIND THE  SCENES THERE IS A RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS USELESS TO SOME  EXTENT? THERE'S A GREAT THING IN THERE  ABOUT HOW THEY CHANGED THE  WORLD. FOUR MILLION HOMEOWNERS HAD TO  BE HELPED. THEY CHANGED THE WORDING THAT  SAID WE HAD TO LOOK FOR FOUR  MILLION BECAUSE WE ONLY HELPED  700,000.
IT'S A CLASSIC WASHINGTON  MOVE. THE PROGRAM GOAL IS TO HELP FOUR  MILLION PEOPLE. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE CLOSE  BECAUSE IT WAS SO BROKEN. THEY WEREN'T REALLY CARING ABOUT  THOSE PEOPLE, THEY WERE TRYING  TO PROTECT THE BANK. CHANGE THE GOAL. WE DON'T WANT TO HELP FOUR  MILLION PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR  HOMES. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE FOUR  MILLION OFFER.
Jon: AS LONG AS THOSE POWER  TO MILLION DON'T TAKE US UP ON  IT. "BAILOUT" IS INCREDIBLE. YOU HAVE TO GET. THIS IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES
