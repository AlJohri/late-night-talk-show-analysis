WELCOME BACK. IN THE WAKE OF THE GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN VERDICT, THERE HAVE  BEEN A LOT OF REACTIONS. LAST WEEK ONE OF THEM GAINED  MORE TRACTION THAN THE OTHERS.
TRAYVON MARTIN COULD HAVE  BEEN ME. 35 YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN TALK  ABOUT SHOULD WE CONVENE A  CONVERSATION ON RACE? I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BE  PARTICULARLY PRODUCTIVE. WHEN POLITICIANS TRY TO ORGANIZE  CONVERSATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, FAMILIES AND  CHURCHES AND WORKPLACES, THERE'S  THE POSSIBILITY THAT PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE HONEST.
John: THERE'S ALSO THE  POSSIBILITY THAT BRITAIN WILL  SINK, EVERYONE WILL DIE AND I WILL BE THE NEXT BOY-KING. BUT, OKAY, IF IT'S A  CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE YOU  WANT, IT'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE YOU'LL HAVE. WE HAVE SENIOR BLACK  CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE WITH  IT. LARRY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT. LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT  RACE.
[BLEEP] YOU, OLIVER. John: LARRY, WHOA. I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU INVITED ME TO HAVE  A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE.
John: THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE A  CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE, IS IT?
THAT'S HOW EVERYONE HAS A  CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE. HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING SINCE  THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH?
AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK  PRESIDENT COMING OUT THIS PUBLIC  AND BASICALLY CALLING AMERICA  RACIST.
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FELT ON  9/11, THAT'S HOW WE FEEL WHEN IT  COMES TO RACE.
SO-CALLED BLACK LEADERS ARE  RUNNING UNDER A CLOAK OF  VICTIMHOOD.
THESE FOLKS WILL BE ANGRY  ABOUT ONE THUG GETTING KILLED.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A GLOBAL  GEORGE ZIMMERMAN.
WHITE PEOPLE DON'T FORCE  BLACK PEOPLE TO HAVE BABIES OUT  OF WEDLOCK.
John: TRUE. UST LIKE NO ONE IS FORCING  BILL O'REILLY TO BE SUCH AS [BLEEP]. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: THAT'S TECHNICALLY  TRUE.
MY POINT, JOHN, WE CAN HAVE A  CONVERSATION WHEN WE'RE NOT EVEN  ON THE SAME PAGE. OR EVEN IN THE SAME BOOK.
John: TRUE OR EVEN IN THE  SAME LIBRARY.
YOU'RE NOT IN THE LIBRARY. MAYBE THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT IN  THE WHITE LIBRARY.
John: REALLY, LARRY, YOU  THINK THE WHITE LIBRARIES WILL  BE NOISIER THAN THE BLACK  LIBRARIES?
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOHN. I STAND CORRECTED. YOU'RE RIGHT. WE TALK A LOT, YEAH. LOOK, THE POINT IS, WHITE AND  BLACK PEOPLE VIEW THE RACIAL  PROBLEM IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT  WAYS. SO LET'S HAVE THE CONVERSATION  BUT START WITH LOOKING AT SOME  NUMBERS.
John: THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. BECAUSE WORDS ARE DANGEROUS  WHEREAS NUMBERS, OF COURSE,  AREN'T RACIST.
WELL, POLL NUMBERS MIGHT NOT  BE RACIST. FRACTIONS ARE.
John: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?   ( APPLAUSE )
THREE-FIFTHS, JOHN. John: THAT IS A PRETTY [BLEEP] RACIST FRACTION RIGHT  THERE.
ACCORDING TO AN NBC WALL  STREET JOURNAL POLL, A MAJORITY  OF WHITES SEE AMERICA AS COLOR BLIND WHEREAS THE MAJORITY OF  BLACKS SEE WHITE PEOPLE AS  CRAZY.
John: HOW CAN THAT  DISCREPANCY BE THERE?
BECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE TEND TO  LOOK AT RACE RELATIONS THROUGH  ROSE-COLORED GLASSES AND BLACK PEOPLE RESENT THE USE OF THE  WORD "COLORED" IN THAT LAST  SENTENCE
John: NO WONDER WE SEE THE  ZIMMERMAN VERDICT DIFFERENTLY.
AGAIN IT COMES BACK TO  NUMBER. WHITE PEOPLE SEE THIS AS ONE  TRIAL. BLACK PEOPLE SEE IT AS YET  ANOTHER ONE.
John: RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY HALF THE COUNTRY  THINKS THIS VERDICT WAS ABOUT  RACE AND HALF THINKS IT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT  RACE.
John: WAIT. HOLD ON. WHICH HALF ARE YOU IN.
THE THIRD HALF. JOHN, THE REAL OUTRAGE OF THE  TRAYVON MARTIN CASE IS THAT AN  ADULT SHOT AND KILLED A CHILD AND THERE WERE NO CONSEQUENCES. LOOK WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT  MADE GEORGE ZIMMERMAN SHOOT AN  UNARMED TEENAGER, MAYBE IT WAS THE LAWS IN HIS STATE OR THE  RACISM IN HIS HEAD BUT IT WAS  DEFINITELY THE GUN IN HIS HAND
John: WE SHOULD BE HAVING A  CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS THEN.
[BLEEP] YOU, OLIVER. SORRY. THAT'S GENERALLY HOW THESE  CONVERSATIONS START
John: THANK YOU, LARRY. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYONE.
