( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. WITH THE ELECTION JUST OVER FOUR MONTHS AWAY, AMERICANSLET HAVE THE CHOICE BARACK OBAMA OR SIR  WILLIAM MITTERSCHMIDE ROMNOSCEROUS. IT'S EASY TO FORGET THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT MAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. PRESIDENT HERMAN CAIN.
IN OCTOBER OF 2011, HERMAN CAIN LED THE POLLS FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. TRAGICALLY, AMERICA WAS DENIED A HOME IN CAIN PRESIDENCY BUT I SAT DOWN WITH MR. CAIN FOR A  SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE TOUGH DECISION HE WOULD HAVE FACED IN OFFICE. TONIGHT, ENERGY POLICY. GAS PRICES ARE STRANGLING AMERICANS, SIR.
YES.
LET'S SELL SOME OF THE FEDERAL LANDS THAT CONTAIN NEWLY DISCOVERED OBTAINED... DO WE  REALLY NEED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF PARKS IN ORDER TO SAY THAT WE ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY?
Reporter: HOW MUCH CAN ONE FAMILY PICNIC?
EXACTLY.
Reporter: RIGHT.
AND IN TODAY'S WORLD WHERE WE ARE A 24/7/365 INFORMATION OVERLOAD SOCIETY, HOW MUCH  PICNICKING ARE THE KIDS DOING WHILE TEXTING WHILE PICNICKING. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE. WE DON'T NEED AS MANY PARKS.
Reporter: THAT'S AN ECOLOGICAL FACT. IF THE ENVIRONMENT DIDN'T WANT US TO DRILL FOR OIL, SIR, WHY DID IT MAKE IT SO USEFUL TO  POWER CARS WITH, RIGHT?
EXACTLY. AS YOU KNOW, I'M A MAN OF FAITH, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ALL MIGHTY PUT THOSE RESOURCES HERE TO BE USED THE RIGHT WAY.
AND NOW THE CRISIS. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE BUILT THE BIGGEST PIPELINE KNOWN TO MAN. IT CONNECTS ALL THE WELLS THAT YOU HAVE DRILLED ON EVERY SINGLE SOURCE OF OIL IN AMERICA. YOU HAVE REDUCED THE PRICE OF GAS DOWN TO 36 CENT PER GALLON. EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.
IT FEELS GREAT BECAUSE IT BENEFITTED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT ALSO BENEFITTED THE ECONOMY.
Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE AN INCOMING CABLE. THE PIPELINE HAS EXPLODED IN SEVERAL SPOTS. OIL IS SPILLING EVERYWHERE AND IT HAS DEVASTATED AMERICA'S PARKS. GATHER THOSE MOST AFFECTED AND EXPLAIN WHY THEIR SACRIFICE IS NOT IN VAIN. ( LAUGHTER ).  ♪ ♪ ♪
ASSEMBLE. WE HAVE A DISASTER ON OUR HANDS. WE MUST CONTAIN IT. WE WILL CONTAIN IT, BUT YOU MUST WORK WITH US IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE AND  ACCELERATE THE CONTAINMENT. 36 CENTS A GALLON. IS A MAJOR ACCOMPLISHIMENT. AND WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THAT ACCOMPLISHIMENT. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SACRIFICED MUCH BUT UNTIL WE GET THIS CONTAINED, RUN. ( LAUGHTER )  ♪ ♪ ♪
Jon:  THANK YOU.
