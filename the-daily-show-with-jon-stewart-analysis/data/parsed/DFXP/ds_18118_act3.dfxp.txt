(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A VERY FUNNY  COMEDIAN WHOSE BEST SELLING BOOK  IS CALLED "DAD IS FAT." PLEASE WELCOME THE BRILLIANT JIM  GAFFIGAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO NICE.
John: THANK YOU FOR BEING  HERE. WE ALL APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU. THE.
John: THE BOOK "DAD IS FAT."  THAT'S SUBJECTIVE, ISN'T IT?
YES.
John: WHERE DOES THE TITLE  COME FROM?
THE TITLE COMES FROM ANYMY  NOW SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SON WHEN HE  WAS FOUR OR FIVE THE FIRST SENTENCE HE WROTE ON A DRY-ERASE  BOARD WAS "DAD IS FAT."  (AUDIENCE REACTS)  THEN HE SHOWED IT TO ME AND I PUT HIM UP FOR ADOPTION.
John: (LAUGHS)  SO HE THOUGHT FOR FOUR TO FIVE  YEARS, WHAT DO I WANT THIS FIRST STATEMENT TO BE? DAD IS FAT. ALMOST LIKE A POEM IN A WAY. AND THEN --
HE KNEW THAT I WOULD LAUGH  AND HE -- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE  THE FIRST TIME HE HAD CALLED ME  FAT. IT WAS LIKE A DAILY OCCURRENCE.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE  FORMALIZED IN THE WRITING.
HE WORKED ON IT.
John: SO LET'S CRUNCH THE  NUMBERS. FIVE CHILDREN --
DO I HAVE FIVE? JOHN I DON'T KNOW YUP.
OH, MY GOD!
John: YET YOU LIVE IN A TWO  BEDROOM APARTMENT IN NEW YORK. THOSE NUMBERS DON'T SEEM TO  MATCH UP.
NO, THEY DON'T. BUT IT'S NOT AS IF WE'RE TRYING  TO PROVE SOMETHING. IT'S NOT LIKE "WE'RE GOING TO  RAISE OUR KIDS IN A BOX."  (LAUGHTER)  IT'S JUST CIRCUMSTANCES -- YOU KNOW, MY WIFE GETS PREGNANT  LOOKING AT BABIES SO SHE IS -- I  DON'T EVEN LET HER HOLD AVOCADOS  JOHN. (LAUGHTER)  BUT YOU CAN'T -- OVER THE PAST  COUPLE YEARS YOU CAN'T REALLY  TURN TO SOMEONE WHO'S SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT AND BE LIKE "HEY  LET'S PACK UP AND MOVE."  SO WE'VE BEEN WAITING AND EVENTUALLY WE'LL MOVE. OR WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER KID. I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
John: FIVE CHILDREN, YOU ARE  THE DEFINITION OF A COMMITTED  CATHOLIC.
I HAVE ONE MORE AND I COULD  BE A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
John: ONE MORE AND YOU GET AN  OFFICIAL MEDAL FROM THE VATICAN.
HEY, THE POPE GAVE ME THESE  SHOES.
John: THEY ARE PRETTY FLY FOR  A WHITE GUY.
I'M CATHOLIC BABY WIFE IS  VERY CATHOLIC, SHE'S A SHIITE  CATHOLIC. SO THERE IS NO GOALIE.
John: THE NUMBERS BACK THAT  UP. JIM, SOUR FUNNY.
THANK YOU.
John: YOU ARE MY WIFE'S  FAVORITE COMEDIAN, INCLUDING ME. (LAUGHTER)  SHE EMCEED -- REMEMBER WE DID  THAT CHARITY GIG WITH BOB SAGET? SHE'D NEVER SEEN YOU LIVE BEFORE  AND YOU WERE DOING THE SUBWAY  BIT AND I COULD HEAR LAUGHS COMING OUT OF HER I'D NEVER  HEARD BEFORE AND SHE WAS  LITERALLY CRYING AND SHE TURNED ME-TO-ME AND SAID "WHY CAN'T YOU  DO THAT?"  (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS VERY FLATTERING. WELL YOUR WIFE IS VERY  BEAUTIFUL. WE BOTH -- OH, WE'RE OUT OF OUR  LEAGUE SO --.
John: I THINK BIOLOGICALLY WE  CAN BOTH OBJECTIVELY SAY WE  TRADED WAY UP.
BECAUSE MY WIFE -- WHENEVER  I'M WITH MY WIFE AND PEOPLE FIND  OUT SHE'S MY WIFE THERE'S USUALLY AN AUDIBLE "WOW."  WHICH I SUPPOSE IS FLATTERING  BUT IT HURTS MY FEELINGS. (LAUGHTER)  I'M NOT A CAVEMAN. (LAUGHTER)  NOT ALL CAVEMAN.
John: THIS IS SO FUNNY. I LAUGHED OUTLOUD IN THIS BOOK. AND THERE'S A CANON OF COMEDIANS  WRITING BOOKS ABOUT CHILDREN AND  FATHER HOOD. ONE OF THE FIRST BOOKS I EVER  WROTE -- SFWLO READ WAS BILL  COSBY "FATHER HOOD" AND THIS IS PAGE FOR PAGE LAUGH OUT LOUD  POUND FOR POUND YOU GO TOE TO  TOE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE  COMPARISONS I CAN DO. TOE TO TOE WITH COSBY.
WELL, THAT'S VERY FLATTERING  BECAUSE COSBY IS THE MAN AND  THAT BOOK INSPIRED THIS I WROTE THIS WITH MY WIFE. I DIDN'T WANT TO BOOBLG DO A  BOOK THAT WAS "I HATE MY KIDS"  AND I DIDN'T WANT TO DO A BOOK THAT WAS LIKE "I WORSHIP MY KIDS  AND JESUS."  I WANTED IT TO BE FUNNY.
John: IT'S A PERFECT BOOK  ABOUT CHILDREN BECAUSE THERE'S A  LOT OF LOVE AND A LOT OF  CONTEMPT. IN THAT CONTEMPT IT'S ALMOST THE  GREATEST LOVE.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO --  THERE'S A GALLOWS HUMOR. WHEN YOU'RE HANDED A BABY IT'S  HARD. IF YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT  PARENTING, THAT MEANS YOU'RE  INVOLVED. JOHN, I WENT TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY  THREE WEEKS AGO FOR MY DAUGHTER,  HER FRIEND, AT 8:00 A.M. ON A  SATURDAY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
John: WHAT?
AND I WAS LIKE WHO'S RUNNING  THIS PARTY? THE TALIBAN? (LAUGHTER)  WHO HAS A BIRTHDAY PARTY AT 9:00  A.M.? BUT IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU'RE  COMPLAINING! I MEAN THERE'S A CERTAIN GALAXY  LIKE DON'T THROW THE BABY OUT  WITH THE BATH WATER. THAT PHRASE CAME FROM SOMEONE  WHO THOUGHT ABOUT THROWING OUT  THE BABY. IT'S A LOT OF WORK!
John: IT'S FANTASTIC. "DAD IS FAT."  IT'S BRILLIANT. JIM GAFFIGAN.
