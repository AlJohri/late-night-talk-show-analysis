Jon: WELCOME BACK. IN AMERICAN HISTORY THERE ARE  CERTAIN MAGICAL EVENTS. THEY OCCUR ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT  WHILE. HALEY'S COMET FLY BY, A METS  WORLD SERIES WIN, DICK MORRIS  ACCURATING CALLING AN ELECTION. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN THERE'S THE RAREST OF THE  RARE, THE CERTIFICATE OF THING  THEY ARE FORETOLD IN PROPHECY AND NEVER DREAM YOU YOURSELF  WOULD LIVE WITH.
JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS BROKE  A SEN YEAR SILENCE ON THE  SUPREME COURT.
Jon: WHY WOULD ONE OF THE  JUSTICES KEEP COMPLETELY QUIET  FOR SO LONG UNLESS -- URSULA THE SEA WITCH STOLE HIS VOICE WHEN  HE FELL IN LOVE WITH A HUMAN! I HAVE LITTLE KIDS. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THERE MUST BE A REASON  CLARENCE THOMAS DOESN'T LIKE TO  SPEAK PUBLICLY. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE MUST BE A REASON THAT HE  KEEPS SILENT THAT DOESN'T  INVOLVE HIM BEING A MERMAN. HE HAS DONE INTERVIEWS.
THE PERCEPTION IS THAT --  CRITICS WILL SAY YOU ARE NOT  SMART ENOUGH, YOU ARE INSECURE.
Jon: THEY MAKE FOOLS OUT OF  THEMSELVES WITH THOSE KINDS OF  COMMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT'S Y. THAT'S NOT  REALLY HIS VOICE. SORRY. WE CHANGED IT FOR HUMOROUS  EFFECT. HERE IS HIS REAL VOICE.
THEY MAKE FOOLS OUT OF  THEMSELVES WITH THOSE KIND OF  COMMENTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NOW, I KNOW WHY HE  NEVER SPEAKS. HE IS PRESERVING THAT BEAUTIFUL  BARITONE. PLEASE CLARENCE CAN I HAVE SOME  MORE OF THAT SULTRY --
JUSTICE MARSHALL RARELY ASKS  QUESTIONS, JUSTICE POWELL RARELY  ASKS QUESTIONS IT'S A PERSONAL  PREFERENCE.
Jon: OH, MR. THOMAS THAT IS  NIESMS NOW I KNOW WHY HE IS  HOLDING BACK. IF HE SPOKE HE WOULD BE BURIED  UNDER A PILE OF PANTIES AND  ROSES. HE IS AAFRAID IF HE SPEAKS TOO  LOUDLY SHIFTS DRAWN BY HIS SONG  WOULD BE LURED TO DEMISE CRASHING UPON THE STEPS OF  JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO AFTER SEVEN YEARS SILENCE  BROKEN. I BET HE LAID DOWN A HELL OF A  JUDICIAL STEMWINDING AFTER SEVEN  YEARS.
THE TRANSCRIPT PICKED UP ONLY  FOUR WORDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WELL I BEAT HE MADE  THEM COUNT. YOU KNOW? WHAT DID HE SAY.
JUSTICE SCALIA MADE A JOKE  ABOUT YALE LAW SCHOOL. JUSTICE THOMAS' ALMA MATER AND  ACCORDING TO THE COURT  TRANSCRIPT HE SAID, WELL, HE DID NOT -- AND THAT'S ALL HE SAID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WELL HE DID NOT? I WAS GOING TO AFTER SEVEN YEARS  YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM OUT. YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! LUKE, I'M YOUR FATHER. THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE -- THAT'S  FOUR (bleep). WELL, HE DID NOT. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN.
WHAT THOMAS APPEARED TO BE  SUGGESTING WAS THAT AN IVY  LEAGUE DEGREE DIDN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THE LAWYER WAS QUALIFIED  AND THE COURTROOM ERUPTED IN  LAUGHTER.
Jon: REALLY? [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD ROOM. SO THAT'S YOUR ONLY EQUIP YOU'VE  BEEN THERE SEVEN YEARS AND NO  OTHER EQUIPS. NOT A -- THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID? SOUNDS LIKE MY WEDDING NIGHT. NOTHING? ARISTOCRATS, NOTHING? PROBABLY THE LAST TIME WE'LL  HEAR FROM HIM. YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO PULL A  COSTANZA.
