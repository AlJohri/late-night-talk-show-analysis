( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK  OPINION MY GUEST TONIGHT A FINE  YOUNG MAN. HE STARS ON A.M.C.'S "MAD MEN."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, JON HAMM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU. CHEERS.
PENNY UNDER MY MUG.
Jon:  PENNY UNDER YOUR  MUG.
I WIN A KISS GLI THOUGHT THE�3  PENNY WAS WORTH MORE.�r  WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN? HOW YOU BE?
I BE VERY WELL, THANK YOU  VERY MUCH. BEEN IN NEW YORK FOR A COUPLE OF  WEEKS SINCE WE WRAPPED UP SEASON  SIX OF "MAD MEN." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  LOOK AT YOU,  THOUGH, MOVING FROM EYE REALLY  THOUGHT ONCE YOU WERE DONE WITH THE-- YOU MOVED ON TO THE WITH  MEGAN, I THOUGHT DRAPER, MAING.
SETTLE DOWN!
Jon:  DONE.
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
AND THE GIRL FROM FREAKS AND  GEEKS SHOWS UP--
WE'RE GOING TO WORK OUR WAY  THROUGH ICONIC TELEVISION SHOWS  BY THE TIME WE'RE DEBATE.
Jon:  THE REFNS POINT FOR  ME IS I REMEMBER HER AS A  JUNIOR-SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.
RIGHT.
Jon:  AND BECAUSE OF  D.VR, I REMEMBER THAT FROM--
SIX WEEKS AGO.
Jon:  RIGHT. AND THEN YOU TURN IT AND YOU'RE  LIKE, DID SHE TRAVEL TO SPACE? HOW DOES DSHE AGE 10 YEARS?"
FIRST OF ALL, LINDA IS A  FANTASTIC ACTRESS AND LOVELY GAL  AS WELL. SHE HAD JUST HAD HER BABY. SO NOT ONLY WAS SHE MANAGING  BEING ON THE SHOW, NOT TELLING  ANYBODY THAT SHE'S ON THE SHOW, INCLUDING FAMILY AND FRIENDS,  BUT ALSO DEALING WITH, LIKE, AN  INFANT.
Jon:  RIGHT, RIGHT,  RIGHT.
I MEAN, I WAS, LIKE, AMAZED  THAT SHE COULD SHOW UP TO WORK  IN THE MORNING MUCH LESS BE AS GOOD AS SHE IS.
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT YOU YOU CAN DO WITHY   OSE, BECAUSE I HAVE TWO OF THOSE, INFANTS. DOUBLE-PANNED GLASS OUTSIDE ON  THE PORCH. YOU CAN BARELY HEAR�i THEM.
YOU CAN BARELY HEAR THEM. ESPECIALLY IN THE SPRINGTIME. NOW IS PERFECT.
Jon:  AND THE BIRDS ARE  CHIRPING. IT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A  ROBIN.
A LIGHT RAIN WILL NURTURE  THEM.
AND BOTH ENJOY THE  REGURGITATED FOOD IN THE MOUTH.
VERY TRUE.
Jon:  THOSE ARE TIPS FROM  MY NEW--
"THE MORE YOU KNOW."  ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  HERE'S WHAT'S  INTERESTING TO ME. SO SHE IS NOT TIEBL TELL EVEN  HER FAMILY THAT SHE IS ON THE  SHOW.
YEAH. IT WAS-- AND SHE KEPT IT  INCREDIBLY SECRET. WE HAD THE PREMIERE, AND SHE WAS  NOT AT THE PREMIERE, EVEN  THOUGH-- SHE WOULD SHOW UP AT THE PREMIERE THEY'D SAY, WHAT,  ARE YOU DOING AT THE PREMIERE?"  AS SOON AS THE CAT GOT OUT OF THE BAG THEN --
SHE COULD SHOW UP.
THEN IT WAS AMAZING, AND  PEOPLE WERE FREAKED OUT AND DUAL   DUALLY SURPRISED.
Jon:  THE C.I.A. CANNOT  KEEP THEIR PEOPLE FROM BEING  OUTED. HOW DO YOU, IN A CAST AND A SET  AND WITH ALL THE PEOPLE--
WE FREQUENT AS A CAST, FAR  FEWER VENEZUELAN PROFT TIEWTS  THAN THE C.I.A., JUST AS THE  GROUP.
Jon:  IT'S MORALITY, GOOD  LIVING.
AS A GROUP. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S SOMETHING WE  DECIDED. IT'S NOT UNIQUE. I MEAN MOST SHOWS-- IT'S NOT  LIKE CLAIRE DANEZ COMES ON AND  SAYS LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S SHOW. WHO IS ON IT.
Jon:  IF THEY GET SPECIAL  GUEST STARS THAT'S BIGGEST PUSH,  THE ADVERTISING IS LIKE-- THEY WILL RELEASE A SPATE OF GUEST  STARS THAT'S COMING ON AS  PROMOTIONS. YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CONFIDENT  IN YOUR STORYLINES AND ACTORS TO  NOT WANT TO USE THAT AS A COMMERCIAL AS OPPOSED TO LETTING  IT PLAY OUT.
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF STUNT  CASTING IS ONE WAY TO THINK  ABOUT IT. WE LIKE KEEPING IT UNDER WRAPS.
Jon:  SMART MOVE, MY  FRIEND. AND YOU'RE HEADING OFF NOW,  YOU'RE GOING TO INDIA.
INDIA.
Jon:  WITH ASSIF MANDVI. ASSIF MANDVI AND JON HAMM ARE  GOING TO INDIA  ( CHEERING )  TO SHOOT-- YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IN AN ASHRAM.
WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING  MARRIED. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  IT WOULD BE NICE. THE COULDN'T HAPPEN TO TWO  BETTER PEOPLE.
I KNOW! IT'S AN EXCITING FILM BASED ON A  TRUE STORY ABOUT AN AGENT WHO  GOES TO INDIA TO TRY FIND TWO CRICKET PLAYERS WHO CAN PLAY  BASEBALL. IT'S A TRUE STORY. ONE OF THE GUYS IS STILL IN THE  MAJOR LESION AT A TRIPLE  A LEVEL. THEY FOUND TWO KID, EXPAEN 17,  TOOK THEM OUT OF INDIA. THEY DIDN'T SPEAK ANY EXWHRSH. THEY NEVER PLAYED BASEBALL BUT  THEY HAD THE RAW TOOLS --
THEY COULD BRING A  90-MILE-PER-HOUR FASTBALL.
YES, BUT IT'S A VERY  DIFFERENT-- YOU WERE A BIG  CRICKET GUY BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.
Jon:  OH, HUGE!
IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW  ABOUT JERSEY IT'S CRICKET CRAZY. ( LAUGHTER )  GLI COULD EAT 10 OF THEM AT ONE  SITTING.
ABSOLUTELY. WAIT A MINUTE!
Jon:  THAT'S THE JERSEY  THING. ARE YOU A BASEBALL GUY, A  BASEBALL FAN?
I AM, I'M AWE HUGE ST. LOUIS  CARDINALS FAN.
Jon:  I'M SORRY, I  COULDN'T HEAR THAT.
THAT WAS I OF A NICE RIVALRY  IN THE 80s OPINION YOU GUY WON  ONE WORLD SERIES AND THEWENT TO  LOU.
Jon:  AND THEYOU MEN MORE  IN THE 90s. I WAS REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT STARTING A  TEAM AGAIN.
YOU SHOULD GET ANOTHER NEW  STADIUM.
Jon:  AND MAYBE WE SHOULD  MODEL IT AFTER EBBET FIELD FOR  NOW REAL REASON. IT'S MODELED AFTER THE DODGER  STADIUM FOR NO REASON. THERE WAS A JACKIE ROBINSON  ROTUND RA, BUT WHEN YOU FIRST  WALK IN THERE, YOU'RE LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
THERE WAS NOT A GARY CARTER  MULLET STATION.
Jon:  JUST AN IMAGE OF  CLEON JONES LYING IN THE BACK OF  THE STATION WAGON.
LENNY DYKSTRA AS A TOBACCO  STATION.
Jon:  WE COULD DO THIS  FOR HOURS.
WE MIGHT.
Jon:
Jon:  THE GREAT JON HAMM,  LET HIM HAVE IT.
