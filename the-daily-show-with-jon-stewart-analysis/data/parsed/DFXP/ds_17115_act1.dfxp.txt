UNE 18, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BIG SHOW TONIGHT. BIG SHOW. MY GUEST, CYBER SECURITY EXPERT AND AUTHOR PARMY OLSEN. SHE'S GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BROADCAST YOUR PASSWORD TO FACEBOOK. LIKE MINE IS PINK LADY 61. ALL RIGHT. MICHIGAN LAST WEEK REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WERE INTRODUCING SEVERAL BILLS THAT WOULD CREATE  MORE STRINGENT BILLS ON ABORTIONS AND ABORTION PROVIDERS WHICH WOULD NOT BE NEWS BY  ITSELF BUT IT IS NEWS FOR THIS ONE GLORIOUS BIT OF FLOOR DEBATE
FINALLY, MR. SPEAKER, I'M FLATTERED THAT YOU'RE ALL SO INTERESTED IN MY VAGINA. BUT NO MEANS NO.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: ZING. THAT'S MICHIGAN DEMOCRAT LISA BROWN WITH A PRETTY DECENT VAGINA ZINGER. WHICH BY THE WAY IS MY FAVORITE CELESTIAL SEASONINGS TEA. MMMMM. OH, THAT'S GOOD TEA. NO HARM, NO FOUL.
MICHIGAN DEMOCRAT SAID THE WORD VAGINA IN AN ABORTION DEBATE. REPUBLICANS BARRED HER FROM SPEAKING AGAIN ON THE STATE HOUSE FLOOR
Jon: HEY, DO YOU BELIEVE THIS LADY BRINGING UP VAGINAS IN AN ABORTION DEBATE? YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF BALLS, LADY. WHAT? OH, NO, I'M OUT TOO. ALL RIGHT. FINE. WHAT ARE THEY WORRIED ABOUT? VAGINAS AREN'T LIKE VOLDEMORTS OR BEETLEJUICE. INVOKING THE NAME VAGINA DOESN'T MAKE THEM SUDDENLY APPEAR. BELIEVE ME, IF IT DID, HIGH SCHOOL WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT FOR ME. I LOST MY VIRGINITY AT 81. THE GIRL APPEALED. I GOT IT BACK IN '83. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MICHIGAN IS SO UPTIGHT ABOUT. IF THEY STATE... CLEAN UP YOUR OWN HOUSE. IF YOU INSIST THAT THE LADIES OF MICHIGAN USE MORE CONSERVATIVE FRIENDLY TERMINOLOGY WHEN ADDING  THEIR VOICES TO THE WOMEN'S HEALTH DEBATE, VAGINA IS OUT. CAN NO LONGER BE USED. THE NEW PREFERRED TERM I GIVE YOU IS THIS. MARGARET SNATCHER. ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT [BLEEP]. IT'S UP TO YOU. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO USE. THAT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK MORE LIKE AN ACTUAL MOUTH. NO... FORGET IT. ALL RIGHT. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT THOUGH. THE EUROPEAN UNION. IT'S A FEDERATION OF NATION-STATES WITH A SHARED CURRENCY MUCH LIKE OUR UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA. THE DIFFERENCE BEING OBVIOUSLY OUR AMBULANCES GO (MAKING AN AMBULANCE SOUND) WHEREAS THERE'S  GOES) MAKING SOUND) AND THEIR PHONES ARE LIKE (MAKING DIFFERENT SOUNDS. ANYWAY THE POINT IS IT'S THE UNITED STATES WITH [BLEEP] AMBULANCES AND PHONES. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING AWAY. EUROPEAN MEMBER-STATE GREECE RACKED BY CRIPPLING DEBT ON THE VERGE OF FINANCIAL COLLAPSE. LAST MONTH GREEK VOTERS REJECTED PRO AUSTERITY CENTRIST PARTIES AND INSTEAD VOTED FOR BOTH FAR  LEFT AND FAR RIGHT PARTIES IN THEIR PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. BUT, HEY, THIS IS WHERE CIVILIZATION STARTED MUCH IT'S GREECE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INVENTORS OF MATH, PHILOSOPHY, LESBIANS. THE OPEN-FACE TURKEY SANDWICH. IF ANYBODY CAN MAKE A COALITION GOVERNMENT OF NAZIS AND COMMUNISTS WORK, IT'S THE GREEKS. THE INVENTORS OF THICK, UNSWALLOWABLE YOGURT. THE INVENTORS OF BALDNESS. THE INVENTORS OF SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A PIE YET IS IS FILLED WITH SPINACH. THE GREEKS CAN MAKE THIS WORK.
Jon: SHE MUST HAVE SAID VAGINA. YOU KNOW WHAT? I EXPECT THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR FROM THE COMMUNISTS. BUT THE NAZIS? THIS REALLY HURTS YOUR REPUTATION. ALL RIGHT. SO THAT COALITION ATTEMPT FAILED. SO THE GREEKS WENT BACK TO THE POLLS YESTERDAY TO TAKE ANOTHER TRY AT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. BY THE WAY, I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THE WHOLE [BLEEP] COUNTRY IS ON FIRE. THAT'S THE STORY ABOUT THE ELECTION AND THE FIRE AND SMOKE IS THE B-ROLL THEY HAVE TO USE  BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS GREECE FAILING FINANCIALLY, THE WHOLE PLACE IS ON FIRE. I CAN ONLY PRESUME THAT ZEUS IN ANGER SAW MORTALS, THREW LIGHTNING AND THE WHOLE THING WENT UP. MY POINT IS THIS, HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION
VOTERS HAVE CHOSEN A NEW LEADER WHO WANTS TO STICK WITH EUROPE AND MOST OF THE ECONOMIC  SACRIFICES THAT REQUIRES
Jon: GREECE DID THE RESPONSIBLE THING. YOU DON'T NORMALLY EXPECT THAT FROM A COUNTRY WHOSE WHOLE BLANK IS WRITTEN IN FRAT SYMBOLS. THE EURO IS PRESERVED. FOR MORE ON THE GREEK ELECTION AND ITS MEANING FOR THE EURO AS A WHOLE, WE GO NOW TO GREECE'S  FORMER CURRENCY, THE DRACHMA.
THE DRACHMA IS BACK, BABY. PACK MY EXTRA SPEEDO. LET'S GET BACK TO WORK
Jon: DRACHMA, ACTUALLY, WOW, THEY VOTED ACTUALLY TO KEEP THE EURO.
WHAT? THE EURO? IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVE THE STRENGTH OF A THOUSAND EUROS
Jon: ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY I THINK YOU'RE WORTH LIKE 1/100th
DRACHMA Jon: LIRA? HEY, JOHNNY, HOW ARE YOU DOING? DRACHMA, YOU'RE GOING AWAY.
LIRA, I'M NOT GOING. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? Jon: GUYS, GUYS, GUYS. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER. YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY VOLATILE
WHAT  ARE YOU TALKING? Jon: ISN'T THAT WHY YOUR COUNTRY GOT RID OF YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY GOT RID OF YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR VOLATILITY
NO , NO, NO. WE'RE JUST PASSIONATE
Jon: ISN'T THAT WHY THE POUND IS REALLY THE ONLY EUROPEAN CURRENCY THAT HAS SURVIVED?
NO, NO, NO. THAT IS NOT TRUE. NO. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LIFE IS WORTHLESS PIECES OF COMIC PAPER. I ONLY ASK BECAUSE I'M STILL IN FULL CIRCULATION. LEGAL TENDER HERE. I WOULDN'T-SURPRISED IF ANY MINUTE NOW SOMEONE PLUCKD ME OFF UP THE BEACH TO PURCHASE A  CADBURY CHOCOLATE. JUBILEEEEE
Jon: BRITISH POUND, THIS IS MEAN
NEVER MIND. I MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. I'M VERY VALUABLE. JUBILEEEEE.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO PARTY. REALLY GOOD.
A PARTY? WILL THERE BE BOATS?
WATER BOATS, YES. Jon: ALL RIGHT. GUYS, ENJOY YOUR CURRENCY ORGY. THE DRACHMA, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
