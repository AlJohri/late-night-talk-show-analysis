FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY  SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE HOUSE  DEMOCRATIC MINORITY LEADER  NANCY PELOSI WILL BE JOINING  US TONIGHT. MAYBE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE  ELECTION! MAYBE WE'LL FWAUKT SELECTION,  WHICH YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IS  HAPPENING, 12 DAYS FROM NOW  IN THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. (LAUGHTER)  I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OTHER  STATES ARE VOTING THIS YEAR,  BUT CANDIDATES ARE BEGINNING  TO MAKE THEIR CLOSING  ARGUMENTS. AND IF I COULD FRAME THEM  THROUGH LYRICS AND MUSIC OF  THE GREAT BRITNEY SPEARS,  BARACK OBAMA IS SAYING TO THE ELECTORATE, HIT ME BABY,  ONE MORE TIME. (LAUGHTER)  WHEREAS MITT ROMNEY IS  PERHAPS SUGGESTING, I'M A  GENIE IN A BOTTLE. (LAUGHTER)  REALLY, THEY'RE NOT SUNG BY  THE SAME PERSON, ARE YOU  SURE? NO, THEY ARE SUNG BY THE  WONDERS THAT JUDGE ON THE  TALENT SHOW. THERE'S TWO MUSIC TALENT  SHOWS? I HAVE GOT TO GET MYSELF A  ZUNE. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? OH, YEAH, MITT ROMNEY'S  CLOSING ARGUMENTS.
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE  UNITED STATES IS NOT A GOOD  VENTURE CAPITALISTS, HE  LIKES TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS, ABOUT $90 BILLION IN  GREEN ENERGY COMPANIES LIKE  SOLYNDRA AND TESS LA A  FRIEND OF MINE SAYS HE DOESN'T MIND PICKING WINNERS  AND LOSERS, HE LIKES PICKING  LOSERS.
HALF OF THEM, THE ONES  INVESTED IN HAVE GONE OUT OF  BUSINESS.
Jon: HOLY CRAP! IS THAT TRUE, HALF? 63 ENERGY COMPANIES GOT  SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL STIMULUS  MONEY AND THREE AND A HALF  YEARS LATER FIVE HAVE GONE  BANKRUPT. SO THAT IS HALF, 50%, THAT'S  AMAZING. THAT'S-- WHAT? OH, THAT'S NOT THE SAME  NUMBER, HOLD ON-- OH, IT'S  ACTUALLY 8%, MAN. I REALLY HAVE TO GET A ZUNE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THEN SELL IT AND GET A  CALCULATOR. WOW, 8% BANKRUPTCY RATE,  STILL, MAYBE THAT DOESN'T  SOUND SO BAD. BUT COMPARE THAT TO MITT  ROMNEY, TOP-NOTCH BAIN  CAPITAL VENTURE CAPITALIST.
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"  DID SOME DIGGING FOR TODAY'S  PAPER IT LOOKED AS 77  BUSINESSES BAIN INVESTED IN WHILE ROMNEY LED THE FIRM. 22% OF THOSE COMPANIES  EITHER FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY  OR CLOSED 8 YEARS AFTER THE  BAIN INVESTMENT.
Jon: SEE, 22%! TO 8% FOR THE GOVERNMENT. SEE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T EVEN  GET MITT ROMNEY AT PICKING  FAILURES. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF  ROMNEY'S NONWINNERS, WAS A  COMPANY CALLED LIFE LIKE  WHICH RECEIVED $2 MILLION FROM BAIN, A PERSONAL LOAN  FROM MITT ROMNEY HIMSELF,  SHORTLY BEFORE IT WENT  BANKRUPT, BAIN SOLD IT, TAKING THE COMPANY FOR  $15,000. WOW, $15,000 DOWN FROM 2  MILLION, THAT'S A SOLID 99%  RETURN MINUS. WHY? WHAT DID LIFE LIKE MAKE?
NOW YOU CAN GET YOUR VERY  OWN MY TWIN AT MY TWIN.COM.
TWICE THE FUN, WE HAVE  MORE FUN.
ONE OF A KIND MY TWIN  DOLLS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IS IT LOOKING AT ME? WHY WOULD MITT ROMNEY THINK  ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO BUY A  PRODUCT SO EARLY CLOSE TO  YET SO CREEPLY FAR FROM  HUMAN? WHY WOULD MITT ROMNEY THINK  THAT A PERFECTLY  SCULPT-- SETTLE DOWN WHY  WOULD MITT ROMNEY THINK THAT  A PERFECTLY SCULPT YET DEAD EYE REFUGEE FROM THE ISLAND  OF BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED,  WHY WOULD HE THINK MILLIONS  OF AMERICANS WOULD WANT THAT? LISTEN, SAY YOU WHAT WANT  ABOUT SOLYNDRA. AT LEAST WITH SOLYNDRA  LITTLE GIRLS DIDN'T WORRY  THAT THEIR SOLAR PANELS  WOULD KILL THEM WHILE THEY  SLEEP. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SO EVEN  TEAM ROMNEY KNOWS NOT EVERY  INVESTMENT PAYS OFF. WHICH IS WHY THE  GOVERNMENT'S INVESTMENT  BATTING AVERAGE ISN'T THEIR  REAL CONCERN.
EVEN IF WASHINGTON COULD  BE GOOD AT PICKING WINNERS  AND LOSERS, WHICH THEY'RE  NOT, THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN THE BUSINESS OF PICKING  WINNERS AND LOSERS. THAT'S NOT THE ROLE OF  GOVERNMENT.
IT'S NOT THE ROLE OF  GOVERNMENT-- THIS IS THE  ISSUE. IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL ONE  ABOUT THE ROLE OF  GOVERNMENT. THE PITHY ESSENCE OF THE  CENTER OF THE CORE OF THE  LIFE LIKE DOLL. SO WHERE SHOULD WE BE  PUTTING GOVERNMENT MONEY?
THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD  BE DEVOTING OUR FEDERAL  DOLLARS, PUTTING MONEY INTO  TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE AND  RESEARCH.
AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR  PELL GRANT PROGRAM GROWING.
I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE TO  INVEST IN OUR BASIC  INFRASTRUCTURE.
HAVING GOOD ROADS AND  BRIDGES AND RAIL LINES AND  SO FORTH AND AIR TRAFFIC  LINES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A STRONG ECONOMY.
Jon: THAT'S PICKING  WINNERS AND LOSERS! INVESTING IN ROADS, RAIL AND  AIRCRAFT AND SAYING YES, TO  CARS, TRAINS AND PLANES BUT [BLEEP] BUY CYCLES. IT MIGHT BE A GOOD DECISION  BUT IT'S STILL PICKING  WINNERS AND LOSERS AND  GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS DONE THAT WANT TO BUILD A  HIGHWAY? WHICH WINNER CONSTRUCTION  COMPANY SHOULD BUILD IT? WHICH LOSER TOWN SHOULD IT  BYPASS. (LAUGHTER)  AGAIN, MAYBE A GOOD CHOICE,  BUT IT'S A CHOICE. EVERY DECISION GOVERNMENT  MAKES PICKS WINNERS AND  LOSERS. OR MAYBE MITT ROMNEY AND  PAUL RYAN DON'T THINK WE  SHOULD HAVE PICKED LOSERS  AND WINNERS IN WORLD WAR II. BUT UNLIKE THEM, I'M GLAD WE  BEAT HITLER. (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS THE WORST POSSIBLE  PLACE YOU COULD TAKE THAT. YOU'RE WELCOME. THIS IS SO OBVIOUS. I'M STARTING TO THINK THERE  IS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON  HERE. WHAT IS ROMNEY AND RYAN'S  REAL PROBLEM.
THE PRESIDENT WOULD SPEND  $90 BILLION ON SO-CALLED  GREEN ENERGY JOBS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS  PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS  BASED ON CONNECTIONS, BASED  ON FADS LIKE SOLYNDRA.
WE ALL LIKE WIND AND  SOLAR BUT YOU CAN'T DRIVE A  CAR WITH A WINDMILL ON IT.
THE PAST PROSPERITY IS  NOT THROUGH SOLAR SHINGLES  AND HIGH SPEED TRAIN. AND BY THE WAY, I LIKE COAL.
Jon: I LIKE IT A LOT! I GIVE IT TO MY GRANDKIDS  EVERY CHRISTMAS! (LAUGHTER)  SO THEY'RE PICKING WINNERS  AND LOSERS. SO HERE IS WHAT IT IS, THE  REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO HAVE A  PRINCIPLESED STANCE THAT  GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS WHEN THE  GOVERNMENT IS RUN BY  DEMOCRATS. BUT WHEN IT'S RUN BY THEM,  PICK AWAY! (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
