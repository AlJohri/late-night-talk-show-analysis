Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT: J.J. ABRAMS  IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HE'S THE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE  NEWEST "STAR TREK" MOVIE COMING  OUT. SOON HE'LL BE IN CHARGE OF THE  "STAR WARS" MOVIES AND YET FOR  SOME REASON ALL OF MY QUESTIONS: WHY DID FELICITY CUT HER SNARE  WHY? (LAUGHTER)  THURSDAY NIGHT I CAUGHT FLAK A  T.V. HUSBAND AND WEEKEND SQUASH  PARTNER BILL O'REILLY. (LAUGHTER)  I WAS TALKING ABOUT CONGRESS' ON  GOING BENGHAZI FREAKOUT AND I  HAPPENED TO CITE A UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STUDY THAT, IN THE BUSH  YEARS, U.S. DIPLOMATIC TARGETS  WERE ATTACKED 54 TIMES WITH 13 AMERICAN DEATHS. DID THOSE SITUATIONS SUFFER FROM  THE SAME POOR INTERAGENCY  MUNICIPALCATION, SUBSTANDARD SECURITY MEASURES OR GENERAL  LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS THE  BENGHAZI SITUATION? WHO THE HELL KNOWS? BECAUSE, FOR ALL 54 INSTANCES  THERE WERE ONLY THREE  CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. WELL -- BLAH. BUT YOUNG WILLIAM THOUGHT OUR  STUDY NEEDED MORE STUDY.
WHEN YOU STUDY THE STUDY YOU  FIND THAT MANY OF THE CITED  ATTACKS OCCURRED IN IRAQ DURING THE WAR.
Jon: BAH! (LAUGHTER)  WELL, THAT IS TRUE IF BY "MANY"  YOU MEAN EIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  EIGHT OUT OF 54. HOW IS THAT "MANY"? I MEAN, BY THAT MATH YOU, BILL  O'REILLY, HAVE MANY VIEWERS WHO  ARE NOT BEDRIDDEN AND  CATHETERIZED. (LAUGHTER)  AND BY THE WAY, I'M SURE  ATTACKING DIPLOMATIC TARGETS IN  IRAQ STILL COUNTS AS AN ATTACK BUT HERE'S WHERE MY FRIEND JUST  GOT MEAN.
JON STEWART APPARENTLY GOT  HIS INFORMATION FROM THE FAR  LEFT WEB SITES MEDIA MATTERS AND THE DAILY KOS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DO NOT! LOOK AT MY BROWSER HISTORY! JUST LOOK AT IT! (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU SEE DAILY KOS OR MEDIA  MATTERS IN THERE? (LAUGHTER)  MOSTLY SIDE-BOB RELATED SITES  AND A IT WILL -T ESPN. (LAUGHTER)  ACTUALLY, WE DID GET OUR INFO  STRAIGHT IF THE UNIVERSITY OF  MARYLAND'S NATIONAL CONSORTIUM FROM THE STUDY OF TERRORISM AND  RESPONSES TO TERRORISM, AN  OUTFIT SO RELIABLE IT WAS CITED BY A CERTAIN foxnews.com. SO, BOOM, BY THE WAY, THAT WEB  SITE COULD USE A SIDE BOB  SECTION. (LAUGHTER)  BUT HERE'S THE THING: WHY BOTHER  FIGHTING, O'REILLY? IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ARGUE  WITH HIM BECAUSE FACTS DON'T  MATTER TO THAT SIDE IN THEIR PARANOID FEVERED DREAM IT IS  STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE C.I.A. CHANGING TALKING POINTS IS  IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE OBAMA LEFT  PEOPLE TO DIE SO HE COULD SWING  OHIO. DESPITE THERE BEING NO SHRED OF  EVIDENCE TO VALIDATE THEIR  FULL-BLOWN RIGHT WING PERSECUTION VICTIMIZATION  COMPLEX.
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE  ADMITTED TODAY THAT SOME OF ITS  EMPLOYEES TARGETED CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL GROUPS FOR EXTRA  SCRUTINY IN VIOLATION OF ITS OWN  POLICY AND DESPITE ITS EARLIER  DENIALS.
Jon: MOTHER (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER)  SON OF A BITCH! NO! MOTHER (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER)  WHAT? WHAT DID YOU DO? (LAUGHTER)
IN THE SPRING OF 2010, JUST  AS THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT WAS  GAINING STEAM, A GROUP OF I.R.S. SPECIALISTS WERE TOLD TO FOCUS  ON ORGANIZATIONS WITH "POLITICAL  SOUNDING NAMES SEEKING TAX-EXEMPT STATUS."
Jon: POLITICAL SOUNDING  NAMES! THAT COULD BE ANYBODY! POLITICAL SOUNDING NAMES. THAT'S NOT RIGHT WING. IT COULD BE HIPPIES FOR CHANGE  OR OCCUPY RALPH NADER. (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN, NOT NECESSARILY JUST  RIGHT WING.
GROUPS WITH NAMES LIKE "WE  THE PEOPLE" OR "TAKE BACK THE  COUNTRY."
Jon: OKAY, THAT'S RIGHT  WING.
SPECIALISTS WERE TOLD TO BE  ON THE LOOKOUT FOR TEA PARTY  APPLICATIONS. ALONG WITH GROUPS WHOSE MISSION  WAS TO EDUCATE ABOUT THE  CONSTITUTION.
Jon: OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. IN THEIR DEFENSE, THERE IS A  GOOD REASON WHY PEOPLE USING THE  I.R.S. TO CRACK DOWN ON POLITICAL ENEMIES WOULD NOT WANT  AMERICANS EDUCATED ABOUT THE  CONSTITUTION. (LAUGHTER)  AND WHILE THE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS  THAT ALL POLITICAL GROUPS GET IS  KIND OF BULL (BLEEP), IT'S BULL (BLEEP) THAT SHOULD AT LEAST BE  GRANTED FAIRLY AND EQUITABLY,  SPREAD AROUND EVENLY, IF YOU  WILL. SO UNLIKE MUCH OF THE BENGHAZI  INQUIRY, THIS SEEMS LIKE A  GENUINE SCANDAL. SO EXPLANATION, PLEASE, LET'S  SAY FROM THE INDIVIDUAL WHO  OVERSEES TAX-EXEMPT  ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE I.R.S.
THEY USED NAMES LIKE "TEA  PARTY" OR "PATRIOTS," AND THEY  SELECTED CASES SIMPLY BECAUSE THE APPLICATION HAD THOSE NAMES  IN THE TITLE. THAT WAS WRONG. THE I.R.S. WOULD LIKE TO  APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
Jon: OH, OKAY, THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE -- WAIT A MINUTE! (LAUGHTER)  I DIDN'T REALIZE APOLOGIES WERE  SUFFICIENT IN I.R.S.-RELATED  ISSUES. (LAUGHTER)  HOLD ON ONE MINUTE. I -- I BET --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I BET IF I'M NOT MISTAKE THAN  RIGHT NOW WESLEY SNIPES FEELS LIKE A REAL AS (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  WAIT, ALL I HAD TO SAY WAS "I'M  SORRY"? INSTEAD OF "ALWAYS BET ON  BLACK"? AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  THIS. YOU KNOW HOW ON MY TAXES I PUT  DOWN I HAVE THAT A FARM? ACTUALLY, I HAD A SALAD. (LAUGHTER)  SO -- SORRY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT DON'T WORRY, IT GETS  FUNNIER.
I SAID THAT ABOUT A QUARTER  OF THE CASES THAT WERE SELECTED  FOR FULL DEVELOPMENT HAD EITHER "TEA PARTY" OR "PATRIOT" IN  THEIR NAME.
OKAY, SORRY, THANK YOU FOR  THE CLARIFICATION BUT THAT WOULD  BE A QUARTER OF THE 300, THEN. SO WE'RE TALKING 75 OR SO?
THAT'S CORRECT. IS THAT A QUARTER?
YES.
THANK YOU, I'M NOT GOOD AT  MATH. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S A GOOD ONE,  LADY WHO WORKS AT THE PLACE THAT  CALCULATE'S PEOPLE'S TAXES. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PRESIDENT  BARACK OBAMA. CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WHO  GENERALLY CAN SURVIVE? AN AEROBIC ENVIRONMENTS HAVE  JUST HAD AN ALGAE BLOOM DROPPED  ON THEIR (BLEEP)ING HEADS. THUS REMOVING THE LAST ARROW IN  YOUR PRO-GOVERNANCE QUIVER. SKEPTICISM ABOUT YOUR OPPONENTS,  GUN CONTROL, WHY CAN'T WE HAVE  BACKGROUND CHECKS?
I BELIEVE IT WOULD PUT US  INEXORABLY ON THE PATH TO A  NATIONAL GUN REGISTRY.
Jon: OH, RIGHT, A NATIONAL  GUN REGISTRY, THE GOVERNMENT IS  GOING TO OVERREACH AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A REGISTRY AND THE  GOVERNMENT'S EVEN CAPABLE OF  THAT KIND OF OVERREACH AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR GUNS  AWAY FROM YOU.
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE  ADMITTED TODAY THAT SOME OF ITS  EMPLOYEES TARGETED CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL GROUPS.
Jon: MOTHER (BLEEP)S! (LAUGHTER)  THIS THIS HAS IN ONE SEISMIC  MOMENT SHIFTED THE BURDEN OF  PROOF FROM THE TINFOIL BEHATTED TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE V.A. CLAIMS BACKLOG AND THE  BOUNCED CHECK FORECLOSURE  CLUSTER (BLEEP) HAD ALREADY GIVEN GOVERNMENT COMPETENCE  FETISHISTS FITS. (LAUGHTER)  GOVERNMENT COMPETENCE FETISHIST  FITS. (LAUGHTER)  AND NOW THIS. IN A FEW SHORT WEEKS, YOU'VE  MANAGED TO SHOW THAT WHEN THE  GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO GOOD THINGS, YOUR MANAGERIAL  COMPETENCE FALLS SOMEWHERE  BETWEEN DAVID BRENT AND A CAT CHASING A LASER POINTER. (LAUGHTER)  BUT WHEN GOVERNMENT WANTS TO  FLEX ITS MORE MALEVOLENT MUSCLES  YOU'RE (BLEEP)ING IRON MAN! YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M OVERREACTING. I STILL BELIEVE-- I REALLY DO--  THAT GOOD GOVERNMENT HAS THE  POWER TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE THE  POWER TO RESTRAIN ITS EXCESSES. I FORGET THAT SOMETIMES AND I'M  -- I'M SORRY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY AND -- OUR  FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS BIGGER  THAN JUST THESE ISSUES. THIS STORM WILL PASS. IT'S JUST -- REALLY? RIGHT NOW?
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE JUST GETTING  INTO THIS INTO THE SITUATION  ROOM CALLING IT A "MASSIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED INTRUSION" THE  ASSOCIATED PERES NOW SAYING THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SECRETLY OBTAINED TWO MONTHS OF PHONE  RECORDS OF ITS REPORTERS AND  EDITORS.
Jon: MOTHER (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
