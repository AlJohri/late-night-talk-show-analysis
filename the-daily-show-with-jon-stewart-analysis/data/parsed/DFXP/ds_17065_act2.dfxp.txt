Jon: WELCOME BECOME. NO MATTER -- REALLY, THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] NO MATTER COMP CANDIDATE WINS TO ANSWER TO THE VOTER AND THEAS VOAER HAS THE NAME. SAMANTHA BEE HAS MORE.
EACH OF FOUR REMAINING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HOPE TO ONE DAY BE CALLED THE MOST  POWERFUL MAN IN WASHINGTON. BUT RIGHT NOW THAT POSITION IS TAKEN. BY THIS GUY.
ONE PERSON IS CONTROLLING THE APRIL AGENDA OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW AND  HIS NAME IS GROVER NOR QUIST.
ASSIST I FEARED LOBBYIST AS HEAD OF AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM. HAS GOTTEN THE MAJORITY OF CONGRESS TO SIGN AN OATH SAYING THEY WILL NOT RAISE TAXES UNDER  ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER. JESUS CHRIST, THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. TO FIND OUT THE LIFETIME PLEDGE HIS SUBS SWORN TO HIM I SAT DOWN WITH HIS LORDSHIP IN THE BOOK  LINED POWER BUNKER.
THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PLEDGE IS IT'S A PUBLIC COMMITMENT NOT TO RAISE TAXES.
IS THERE A SCENARIO IN WHICH WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE WITH SOMEONE RAISING TAXES.
NO.
RIGHT NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SENDS 4% OF G.D.P. ON DEFENSE.
NATURAL DISASTER.
YOUR HOUSE IS KNOCKED DOWN AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RAISES YOUR TAXES AND THAT MAKES  YOU BETTER OFF.
BEARD FLU?
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT.
WHAT ABOUT THE RISE OF THE APES?
IF THE -- LOOK, THE LA DID YOU GET MATE.
IF THE CHIMPS TOOK OVER WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE?
WE WOULD PREFER THAT NOT TO HAPPEN BUT --
WELL --
I THINK RAISING TAXES WOULD NOT STOP THAT.
THE PLEDGE IS SO RIGID THAT EVEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VIOLATION OF THAT HIS  MANCRUSH WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VIOLATION OF IT, TOO, REPEATEDLY. THIS STEWARD OF PUBLIC POLICY HASN'T LOST SIEGHTD OF WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
MY TEAM IS WINNING. IF YOU TALK TO HARRY REID HE WANTED A $2.5 TRILLION TAX INCREASE.
YOUR TEAM IS WINNING IT'S LIKE YOU CAME UP WITH THIS WHOLE IDEA WHEN YOU WERE 12.
I DID WHEN I WAS 12 BECAUSED WE HAD A TEACHER.
YOU CAME UP THIS -- WHAT DID YOU SAY YOU CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA WHEN YOU WERE --
IN SEVENTH GRADE.s
THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS PARALYZED BECAUSE OF A DOCUMENT WRITTEN BY A  12-YEAR-OLD UNTIL 1968. WHAT OTHER GRIDLOCK INDUCING THE IDEAS DO YOU HAVE WHEN YOU WERE 12?
SOME THING THIPS WERE SIMPLE. IF ONE OF THE PARTIES WOULD BRAND ITSELF AS THE PARTY THAT WOULDN'T RAISE TAXES THAT WOULD  BE A WAY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO SUCCEED.
LET'S SAY I'M A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL AND YOU'RE A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY. EXPLAIN YOUR IDEA ABOUT BRANDING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO ME.
OKAY. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE.
OH, MY GOD, GUYS IRK THERE'S LIKE A NERD TALKING TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING.
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE VOTING FOR IT'S HELPFUL IF  THERE'S A BRAND IDENTIFICATION.
WHAT?
ONE PARTY WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES. ONE WON'T. MAKES IT EASIER TO CHOOSE.
I DON'T KNOW EVEN -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE IS SAYING. HE HAS A FRUIT ROLLUP IN THE BEARD. FINAL, I'LL MAKE OUT WITH YOU BUT NOTHING SOUTH OF EQUATOR. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE HIM IF THEIR CORNER SO IF DEMOCRATS ARE EVER TO WIN THIS FIGHT, THEY  NEED THEIR OWN THINK TANK FULL OF 12-YEAR-OLDS. I SHOWED THESE POLITICAL WONDER-KINS -- THIS IS THE ACTUAL THING.
THE PLEDGE, YEAH.
THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING THAT NORMAL PEOPLE WOULD SIGN.
I WOULD NEVER SIGN A PLEDGE WRIEN BY A 12-YEAR-OLD. IT'S LIKE STUPID.
MAYBE I NEEDED TO SPEND MORE TIME CONNECTING WITH THEM. SO, TEENS, VAM PIRES, HUH? -- VAMPIRES, HUH? JUSTIN BIEBER, iPODS, SLAP BRACELETS, RIGHT?
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?
LIKE 53. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU JUST MADE IT TO THE TOP OF MY (bleep) LIST. MAYBE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS REALLY NEEDED WERE FRESHER, YOUNGER VOICES. ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE SOME IDEAS TO SOLVE ALL OF AMERICA'S PROBLEMS FOREVER INTO THE FUTURE.
SELL APPLES.
EXTEND METRO NORTH TO VERMONT.
THAT'S SOMETHING. ANYTHING MORE GLOBAL?
ROBOTS INSTEAD OF ARMY.
STEP ASIDE NORQUIST. YOU'VE BEEN
