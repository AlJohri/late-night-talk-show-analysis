WELCOME BACK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LAST WEEK ONE BRAVE REPUBLICAN STOOD UP TO THE RADICAL WING OF HIS PARTY, TOOK THE COURAGEOUS, UNPRECEDENTED MOVE OF NOT VOTING TO ERADICATE THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE OBAMACARE. OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE SAT DOWN WITH RENEGADE REPRESENTATIVE, SCOTT RIGELL.
MEET REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT RIGELL, TRAITER.
WELL, I VOTED NO, TURNED OUT THAT I WAS THE ONLY REPUBLICAN. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT THE TIME. WHEN I LEARNED THAT, I CALLED MY CHIEF OF STAFF AND I SAID TO CHRIS, BRACE YOURSELF.
THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE HIS REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES HAD ALREADY FIGURED OUT THAT HE HATES AMERICA.
IT WASN'T AN EASY VOTE TO CAST BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE THE UNAFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND THAT IS HOW I SEE IT, IS REALLY NOT GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY, BUT I VOTED NO ON THAT BILL BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE SUPERSEDED IT AND TRUMPED IT, AND THAT IS MY DESIRE TO GET US BACK TO REGULAR ORDER AND TO NOT HURT OUR ECONOMY AND OUR TROOPS.
OKAY, ARE YOU JUST EXPERIMENTING WITH REASON TO SEE IF YOU LIKE IT? IS THIS LIKE A REASON  RUMSPRIGA FOR YOU?
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME TO REPRESENT SANE BUDGETING IN WASHINGTON.
WHAT ARE YOU? WHO WOULD BELIEVE SOMEONE IN CONGRESS WAS PUTTING THE BIGGER PICTURE AHEAD OF POLITICS. WHAT A FREAK SHOW. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE? YOU HAVE ESSENTIALLY VOTED WITH THE DEMOCRATS. THESE PEOPLE ARE YOUR SWORN ENEMIES.
NO, I LIKE TO THOUGHTFULLY ENGAGE MY DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS IN DEBATE.
MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE THE STOMACH FOR A FIGHT, ARE YOU AFRAID, ARE YOU AFRAID OF --
SURELY NOT. I AM A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR THE VALUES AND THE PLANS THAT I BELIEVE IN. I REJECT THAT. MY TRACK RECORD, THE WAY TO DO THIS, THE WAY TO DO THIS IS NOT WHAT A PERSON SAYS, IT'S WHAT HE OR SHE DOES, REFLECTED IN THEIR VOTE. YOU CAN LOOK AT MY VOTE AND SEE THAT I'M AMONG THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. SEE, YOU'RE DOING JUST WHAT IS WRONG WITH WASHINGTON.
THOSE WERE CHICKEN NOISES THAT YOU WERE HEARING.
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS UP HERE, PEOPLE CARICATURE PEOPLE.
IT ALL CALLED INTO QUESTION WHETHER HE WAS EVEN FIT TO SERVE WITH THE STEWARDS OF THIS HALLOWED INSTITUTION.
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY FUN FILIBUSTERS PLANNED? MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE FOUNDING FATHERS WANTED THIS PROCESS TO WORK?
WELL, I KNOW HOW THEY WANTED IT TO WORK. THE FOUNDING FATHER, I BELIEVE, WOULD CERTAINLY THINK ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY AND ADVANCE THAT PROPOSITION --
NO, NO, NO. DIDN'T GET IN A SINGLE TALKING POINT OR CRITICIZE THE DEMOCRATS AT ALL. I THINK WHAT YOU MEANT TO SAY WAS OBAMACARE IS LIKE SLAVERY AND OR RAPE AND FASCISM.
OH, THAT'S HORRIBLE, NO.
YOU ARE SO BAD AT THIS. WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO.
PERHAPS HE JUST NEEDED TO WITNESS THE AWESOME POWER OF THE TANTRUM. TRY THIS.
I'M GOING TO HOLD MY BREATH AND I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU DO WHAT I SAY.
SAM THIS IS-- SAM THIS IS NOT GOOD. SEE THIS IS NOT GOOD. THIS IS LIKE BOTH PARTIES IN THIS DEATH GRIP. I NEED TO YOU BREATH, SAM, NO, NOT GOOD. YOU NEED TO BREATHE. COME ON NOW. OKAY? COME ON NOW. LOOK, THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY. I'M IMPRESSED. WOW. SAM? SAM? SAM?
SEE, THAT TOTALLY WORKED. GOT YOUR ATTENTION.
WE NEED TO GET TO YOU A DOCTOR.
OH, BOY.
YOUR HEAD IS BLEEDING.
I NEED AN ORANGE JUICE. LESSON LEARNED, ALWAYS STICK TO YOUR POSITION NO MATTER HOW MANY BRAIN CELLS HAVE TO DI IN THE PROCESS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
