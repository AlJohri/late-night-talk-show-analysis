[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTRESS  STARS ON BOTH "MAD MEN" AND  NBC'S "COMMUNITY."
SAD NEWS THEY CLOSED THE SKI  SLOPES, A DOZEN SCOUTS GOT  BURIED IN AN AVALANCHE. SAD. I SAY WE CUT OUR LOSSES AND HEAD  HOME.
WHY? WE'RE HERE. WE COULD HANG OUT AT THE  CONVENTION. I WOULD HAVE MORE FUN HANGING  OUT WITH PARENTS THAT ARE  CIRCLING.
WHY ARE PEOPLE CHEERING AT  YOU.
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A  MAN WHO HAD SEX BEFORE.
HOW MANY OF THOSE DO YOU HAVE  IN THE CHAMBER?
ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE RIDE  HOME.
WHAT?
HE WANTED IT TO WE A  SURPRISE. YOU ARE A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE  TO THE SUPERVILLAGE.
NOW WE'RE DEFINITELY LEAVING.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME ALISON  BRIE. HELLO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO LOVELY.
Jon: ENJOY!
LOVELY.
Jon: SOAK IT IN.
EATING IT UP.
Jon: SOAK IT IN. HOW ARE YOU? COMMUNITY IS BACK NOW.
IT IS BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BEEN MANY RUMORS THAT -- TOOK US  A LITTLE WHILE TO GET BACK.
Jon: YOU BEGAN FILMING IN  THE LATE 90s WHEN THEY MOVED  SOME THINGS AROUND.
YEAH, YEAH. THE GOOD NEWS IS I'M AGING  BACKWARDS.
Jon: THAT'S GREAT. IT'S A GREAT SHOW, IT'S REALLY  FUNNY.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I KNOW THERE'S A LOT  OF TENSION ON THE SET SOMETIMES  WITH THE PERSONALITIES. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR JOHN OLIVER.
HE CAN BE TOUGH. HE WAS A TYRANT. WE DIDN'T HAVE HIM BACK IN THE  FOURTH SEASON. I SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO.
THEY LISTENED TO ME.
Jon: THE THING, THESE  PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE IN THE  MONARCHY AND THAT'S WHY THE BRITISH --
IT'S A PROBLEM.
Jon: ONCE YOU TAKE AWAY THE  GREEN CARD WE HAVE NO LEVERAGE  OVER THEM. IT'S TOUGH.
IT'S TRUE. HE CAME BY MY DRESSING ROOM  TODAY.
Jon: SO SORRY.
IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
Jon: IT IS. I PASS HIM IN THE HALLWAYS AND  IT GIVES ME THE CHILLS. [LAUGHTER]
I KNOW.
Jon: IT'S A --
IT'S BRITISH.
Jon: YOU ARE ALSO FILMING  "MADMEN."  YOU ARE DOING FILMS AND YOU HAVE  A BAND.
BAND. I LIKE TO DO THIS. IT'S A VENTURE FOR ME. IT'S A COVER BAND. WE'RE CALLED THE GIRLS. A LOT OF THOUGHT WENT INTO THAT  TITLE.
Jon: SURE, SURE.
REALLY THOUGHT THAT THROUGH. BUT YEAH, WE COVER SOME SONGS. WE DON'T PLAY ANY INSTRUMENTS. WE JUST SING. WE TAKE POP SONGS AND ROCK SONGS  AND BREAK THEM DOWN.
Jon: IS IT A CAPELLA?
NO. WE HAVE A BAND. BROTHER BAND LIKE JONES STREET  STATION THEY ARE OUT OF NEW  YORK. A COOL BLUEGRASS BAND.
Jon: JONES STREET STATION  AND THEY FLY OUT TO SING WITH  GIRLS.
YES, WITH THESE SPECIFIC  GIRLS.
Jon: YOU MUST BE VERY NICE  GIRLS.
I MEAN.
Jon: WHAT ARE THE COVERS. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE  MUSICALLY?
CLASSIC ROCK AND ALSO SOME  COUNTRY. WE'VE DONE A LITTLE HAL AND  OATES, SPRINGSTEEN, DOLLY PARTON  FOR GOOD MEASURE.
Jon: WHAT IS THE  SPRINGSTEEN. NOT THAT I'M A CRAZY FAN BUT  WHAT DO YOU?
WE DO I'M ON FIRE.
Jon: OH, GOD.
IT'S A CLASSIC.
Jon: IT'S A CLASSIC  SPRINGSTEEN SONG. IF COULD YOU BE JUST A MUSICIAN,  WOULD YOU DO THAT?
NO, NO. MY FIRST LOVE IS ACTING.
Jon: O STOP.
NO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE  ABILITY TO WRITE OUR OWN SONGS  WHICH I THINK IS A FLAW IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BE A REAL BAND.
Jon: ARE YOU TAKEN A STAB? HAVE YOU TRIED?
NEVER TO BE FAIR I THINK THAT  THE OTHER GIRLS COULD WRITE  MUSIC BUT I'M NOT INCLINED THAT  WAY. MY FATHER IS A GREAT MUSICIAN. HE WRITES SONGS. I'VE BEEN AROUND IT MY WHOLE  LIFE.
Jon: WHAT DOES HE PLAY?
GUITAR AND MANNED LYNN. TERRY CHARLES BAND.
Jon: A MURMUR OF  RECOGNITION THROUGH THE  AUDIENCE. I HAVE THEIR CDS RIGHT HERE, I  DON'T BELIEVE IT.
MY SISTER WHEN SHE WATCHES  WILL SAY I KNOW THAT BAND.
Jon: IT'S MY DAD! DID YOU PLAY AN INSTRUMENT  GROWING UP. DID THEY HAVE YOU DO MUSIC OR  WANT TO YOU GET AWAY FROM THAT?
I WAS ALWAYS SO INTERESTED IN  ACTING THAT MY PARENTS WERE LIKE  DO THAT, DO THAT. THERE WAS A BRIEF PERIOD WHERE I  LEARNED TO PLAY SOME SONGS ON  THE UKULELE. I'M NOT GOOD AT TUNING IT SO  IT'S A PROBLEM.
Jon: I ALWAYS ASSUMED IT'S  NOT AN INSTRUMENT JUST SOMETHING  PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BE FUNNY.
FAIR ENOUGH. FAIR ENOUGH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO THIS WILL IS  "COMMUNITY" IS NOW. WHEN IS "MADMEN" BACK.
YES IT'S BACK APRIL --
Jon: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED --  IS THAT A SECRET.
NO, THEY ANNOUNCED THE DATE  BUT I FORGOT TO LOOK AT IT.
Jon: IT'S APRIL --
APRIL SOMETHING. LOOK IT UP.
Jon: YOUR BAND'S NEXT  PERFORMANCE IS.
WE'LL WE'LL BE OUT HERE YOU
