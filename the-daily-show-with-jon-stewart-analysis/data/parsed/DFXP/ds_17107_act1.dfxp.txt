JUNE 4, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  .   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WEWELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD PROGRAM TONIGHT. AN AMAZING PROGRAM. GOING TO BE INTERVIEWING TWO GUESTS, COAUTHORS OF BOOK ENTITLED "IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN  IT LOOKS." IT'S A BOOK ABOUT THIS THING ON MY BACK. NO. BEFORE WE GET THE SHOW STARTED I DO WANT TO SAY SOMETHING. TELL ME YOU KNOW THIS. FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS OR SO, I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE NEW YORK METS ORGANIZATION. FOR THAT ENTIRE 50 YEARS THE METS AND I HAVE HAD ONE THING IN COMMON. NEITHER OF US HAD EVER THRONE A NO-HITTER. THAT ALL CHANGED ON FRIDAY NIGHT. I WAS THERE BECAUSE I AM A COTTON CANDY VENDOR. YOU MAY HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN IT ON SPORTS CENTER. YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE METS' FIRST NO-HITTER IN THEIR EXISTENCE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT. THIS IS MY EYE REPORT. I FILMED THIS. THIS IS THE LAST PITCH. EVERYBODY IS GOING CRAZY. THE PLAYERS START RUNNING ON THE FIELD. ALL THAT. INCREDIBLE TO BE THERE. FOR ME THE GREATEST PART WAS I WAS ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH MY FAMILY. MY CHILDREN WERE THERE. THEY I THINK REALLY APPRECIATED A NIGHT OF HOT DOGS, ICE CREAM, POPCORN, MORE ICE CREAM, AND THEN BEING ROBUSTLY SHAKEN. (LAUGHING ). BOTH OF MY KIDS JUST DID THIS. THEY HAD EATEN SO MUCH. ALL I WAS DOING WAS SHAKING THEM AROUND. THEY BOTH DID THIS. WHAT A GREAT... BUT I SUFFERED MUCH FOR THESE METS OVER MY LIFE WHICH IS WHY THESE MOMENTS OF  JOY THAT OCCUR SPORADICALLY ARE EVEN MORE APPRECIATED. THIS MET TEAM IS A FUN TEAM. THEY'RE A SCRAPPY TEAM. THEY PLAY THE GAME RIGHT. THESE 2012 METS. I GIVE YOU FOR ANYBODY WHO WONDERS AT HOME WHAT THE FACE OF A TRUE METS' FAN AT THE END OF  THE FIRST NO-HITTER OF THE NEW YORK METS' EXISTENCE LOOKED LIKE. (LAUGHING ). (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  . ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. ANYWAY, NOW IF ANYBODY WAS WONDERING IF I HAVE AN O-FACE, THAT IS IT. THE MAIN STORY COMES FROM A CELEBRATION ACROSS THE POND.
THE BOAT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A FLOTILLA HONORING QUEEN ELIZABETH, DRESSED IN WHITE AS  SHE CELEBRATED 60 YEARS ON THE THRONE.
Jon: 60 YEARS ON THE THRONE. GET THAT WOMAN SOME FIBER. IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE. YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THROUGH THE INSIDE OF A CAR WASH THAT IS ENGLAND IN JUNE.
WHEN THE ORCHESTRA STARTS UP, PRINCE PHILIP JOINS IN. CAMILLA TAKES THEIR LEAD AND THE FAMILY DANCED.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT DANCING. THEY'RE SHIVERING. PEOPLE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUN AND HYPOTHERMIA? OF COURSE, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA'S MEDIA STILL RECOVERING FROM LAST YEAR'S POMP AND  CIRCUMSTANCE OVER THE ROYAL WEDDING. ONLY CNN WENT FULL FLOTILLA WITH TWO SOLID HOURS OF COVERAGE THAT COULD BEST BE DESCRIBED AS...
AN ORGY OF EXCITEMENT. Jon: YES. AN ORGY. QUEEN ELIZABETH'S DIAMOND JUBILEE WAS A [BLEEP]FEST OF MARVELOUSNESS. IT WAS A GANG BANG OF AWESOME. SORT OF WHAT YOU AND I APPEARED TO BE TUG BOAT AND GARBAGE BARGES FESS TOONED IN  PAPIER-MACHE DRIFTING IN CELEBRATION OF A DURABLE OLD LADY'S CONTINUED NON-DEATH WAS  TO THE TRAINED JOURNALIST'S HIGH MUCH, MUCH MORE.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SPECTACLE QUITE LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE.
I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW ROYAL OCCASIONS OVER THE YEARS BUT NOTHING QUITE LIKE THIS.
EXTRAORDINARY. THIS IS FANTASTIC. AMAZING. BSOLUTELY AMAZING. THIS IS CRAZY STUFF. WHAT AN AMAZING THING. IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING? 'M PRACTICALLY SPEECHLESS. THIS IS BRITAIN AT ITS BEST. OH, MY GOODNESS. IT'S PULLING THE 360 WE HAD ONLY HEARD ABOUT.
A RAPID FIRE 360 TURN. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY BOAT THAT SIZE DO THIS. ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE.
Jon: I'M GETTING WORD THERE'S A SCHOONER DOING A K-TURN. A SCHOONER. IS THIS SOMEHOW THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF A MONSTER TRUCK SHOW? COME DOWN TO THE THAMES AND SEE A ROTATING BOAT. OUTSTANDING. IF YOU THINK THE FLOTILLA IS EXCITING, JUST WAIT UNTIL CNN GETS A LOW LOAD OF WHAT'S  HAPPENING COME.
THE GRAND FINALE WHERE THE QUEEN WILL BE WITNESSING FOR THE FLY-BY.
IT WILL BE SPECTACULAR. -PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. THE MOST SPECTACULAR PART OF THE WHOLE THING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE QUEEN FOR NOT SMILING AS MUCH. BUT YOU SAY WE WILL DEFINITELY BE SEEING A SMILE ONCE WE SEE THAT FLYOVER IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.
Jon: IT'S THE ONLY THING STILL KEEPING HER ALIVE. THE FLY-BY. IT'S LIKE BOATS IN THE SKY. IT WILL MAKE THE WHOLE MISERABLE DAY WORTH IT.
WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS. Jon: OH, NO. BREAKING NEWS. THAT'S RIGHT. CNN. THERE WAS THAT TRAGIC PLANE CRASH IN NIGERIA AT THE EXACT SAME TIME WITH THOSE TERRIBLE CASUALTIES. THIS IS WHERE REAL LIFE INTRUDES ON THE FAIRY TALE, PROBABLY WHERE CNN CUTS AWAY AND WE'LL  GET BITS AND PIECES OF TAPED RECAST. CNN GOES WALL TO WALL ON THE TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
SADLY THE FLY-BY HAS BEEN CANCELED. DUE TO THE AWFUL CONDITIONS, THE ROYAL NAVY HAS JUST CONFIRMED TO US THAT THERE WILL BE NOFULLY-BY  WHICH IS VERY, VERY SAD.
Jon: YES. IT WAS ONE OF THE TWO VERY SAD AIRPLANE STORIES OF THE DAY. YOU HATE TO BE THE GUY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CANCEL THEFULLY-BY THOUGH. DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS, YOUR MAJESTY, WE HAD TO CANCEL THE... SO NO BIG FLY-BY. YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE FIREWORKS.
Jon: I'M SORRY. FIREWORK. FOR MORE ON THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE CELEBRATION WE TURN TO OUR CORRESPONDENT IN LONDON. JOHN OLIVER, NICE TO SEE YOU. OH, MY GOSH. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS. WHAT'S THE MOOD LIKE OVER THERE?
(CRYING ) DID YOU SEE THE BOAT, JON?
Jon: I DID. CALM DOWN, JOHN.
DID YOU SEE THE ONE BOAT TURN AROUND? DID YOU SEE THAT?
Jon: JUST BREATHE, JOHN. JUST BREATHE.
I'M SO SORRY. I'M GOOD. JON, IT'S THE QUEEN AND THE BOATS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER AND THE BOATS AGAIN AND THE  QUEEN ON THE BOAT. AND THE BOAT AND THE QUEEN.
Jon: IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE IT'S RAINING, JOHN.
NO, IT'S NOT RAINING HERE, JON. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S A SUNNY DAY.
Jon: REALLY, BECAUSE YOU LOOK SOAKING WET?
NO, PROBABLY JUST EXCITEMENT SWEAT. FROM THE BOATS AND THE QUEEN ON THE BOAT AND THE TURN.
Jon: NO NEGATIVES. THERE'S NO NEGATIVES FROM THE EVENT AT ALL? EVEN IN A TIME OF AUSTERITY IN GREAT BRITAIN.
JON, OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND NOT THINK  ABOUT WHAT IT REPRESENTS. THE SAD LAST GASP OF A ONCE POWERFUL EMPIRE. ITS BEST DAYS LONG BEHIND IT DESPERATELY TRYING TO CONJURE UP A HAPPIER TIME WHEN IT WAS  SOMETHING MORE THAN A DECAYING RELIC.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY A PRETTY HARSH THING TO SAY ABOUT YOUR OWN HOMELAND.
NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT CNN. Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. THEY SAY THE SUN NEVER SETS ON CNN'S MIGHTY NEWS EMPIRE. REMEMBER, THIS IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT COVERED THE FIRST GULF WAR. NOW LOOK WHAT THEY'VE BEEN REDUCED TO. A BUTLER SPENDING TWO HOURS TALKING ABOUT BARGES. LOOK UPON YOUR WORK, TED TURNER, AND DESPAIR.
Jon: I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. IT APPEARS THE RAIN IS INCREASING, JOHN.
NO, NO, NO. IT REALLY ISN'T. YOU KNOW THE CAMERA ADDS TEN POUNDS. THIS IS JUST A LIGHT DRIZZLE, JON.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. JOHN, IT APPEARS TO BE RAINING BAKED BEANS. THAT'S TERRIBLE.
(MUMBLING ). Jon: I UNDERSTAND. WAIT, IS THAT...
(MUMBLING ) DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
Jon: SHOULDN'T THEY JUST CANCEL THE PARADE? IF THE WEATHER IS GOING TO BE THIS BAD AGAIN, JUST CANCEL IT?
NO, WE DO NOT CANCEL IT, JON. THIS IS ENGLAND. WE DON'T BACK DOWN, NOT FROM NAZIS, NOT FROM RAIN, NOT FROM TOAST AND ESPECIALLY NOT FROM  [BLEEP]. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN.
