OCTOBER 28, 2013, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. THE VERY FAMOUS -- THANK YOU!  MY GUEST TONIGHT -- OH, STOP!  MY GUEST TONIGHT, MR. NICK  OFFERMAN WILL BE JOINING US. VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. THE TOP STORY, OF COURSE, THE  WHITE HOUSE'S ONGOING STRUGGLE  TO FIX THEIR BELEAGUERED  HEALTH CARE WEBSITE. TONIGHT I'M HAPPY TO REPORT PROGRESS.
THE LATEST CHANGE IS  SIMPLY COSMETIC. THE SMILING WOMAN ON THE HOME  PAGE IS GONE.
Jon: GONE!  [LAUGHTER] GET OUT!  THEY GOT RID OF THAT SMILING  LADY!  ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE THE NEW  HOME PAGE IS AN IMPROVEMENT. [LAUGHTER] WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TODAY  [LAUGHTER] WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TODAY  TALKING ABOUT HOW THE LEG SWING  SHOULD GO. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE BORED. PLEASE TELL ME THAT IT'S NOT THE ONLY CHANGE THAT THEY'RE MAKING  TO THE SITE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S  PROMISING IT WILL BE LARGELY  PROBLEM-FREE BY THE END OF  NOVEMBER.
WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WORKING  OVERTIME 24/7. TO BOOST CAPACITY AND ADDRESS  THESE PROBLEMS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR. THESE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE GIVEN  BREAKS. [LAUGHTER] MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE  CHILDREN.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I DO THINK --  I DO THINK -- LIKE THAT? I DO THINK I MAY HAVE SPOTTED  ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AFFECTING  WHY THE HEALTHCARE.GOV SITE IS  SO SLOW. APPARENTLY THE SERVERS ARE BEING OVERLOADED BY NEWS CASTERS FROM  EVERY SINGLE NETWORK TRYING TO  LOG ON. NO NETWORK HAS BEEN LOGGIER THAN OUR PALS AT CNN THAT WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY HAVE A CLOCK.
WE'RE ALMOST 13 MINUTES IN  AND SHE'S BEEN LOCKED OUT TIME  AND TIME AGAIN.
ONE MAKING PROGRESS. THE OTHERS GOING SLOW AND NOW  SLOWER. ONE PERSON IS REACHING OUT TO  GET HELP ONLINE. WE'LL FIND OUT HALFWAY INTO THE  LIVE OBAMA CARE SIGNUP EFFORT. SO FAR WE'RE SEEING PROGRESS,  SERIOUS SET BACKS.
YOU MAY LIKE THE OPTIONS. YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE IN YET. YOU LOVE THE OPTIONS. HAPPY WITH IT?
ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S NOT VERY STREAMLINED. IT'S KIND OF A LOT -- IT'S A LOT TO SORT THROUGH.
Jon: PLUS, THERE'S CAMERAS  AND A CLOCK AND YOU [BLEEP] ARE  BREATHING DOWN MY NECK. [LAUGHTER] I LOVE HOW THE ONE LADY GOES, I  LOVE THE OPTIONS. YOU LOVE THEM? LET'S TALK TO GABE. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT  IS REALLY IN THE THING. LET'S TALK TO GABE.
THE ONLY THING MORE  DISTURBING THAN SIGNING UP FOR  HEALTHCARE.GOV IS APPARENTLY  WATCHING PEOPLE TRY AND SIGN UP FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV.
WE'RE WATCHING THESE PEOPLE  TRYING TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMA CARE HERE IN THE SITUATION ROOM.
Jon: WOW!  THAT WOMAN'S REACTION, YOU THINK PEOPLE WERE [BLEEP] IN A CUP OR  SOMETHING. THAT WAS WEIRD HOW SHE REACTED  TO PEOPLE TRYING TO SIGN UP FOR  A WEBSITE. ANYWAY, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS PROMISED THE SITE WILL BE  FIXED BY THE END OF  NOVEMBER. JUST IN CASE IT'S NOT, NO  WORRIES.
THERE WILL BE A HEARING THIS  MORNING ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S  NEW HEALTHCARE WEBSITE.
Jon: CONGRESS [LAUGHTER] IS ON THE CASE. WHO BETTER TO FIX THIS THAN  CONGRESS? [LAUGHTER] IN FACT, NOT JUST CONGRESS, THE  COMMITTEE WHO'S SECOND-RANKING  DEMOCRAT ENTERED CONGRESS FOUR  YEARS BEFORE THE 1959 INVENTION  OF MICRO CHIPS.
I REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THE  LAST PERFECT LAW CAME OFF THE TOP OF MOUNT SINAI WITH MOSES WRITTEN ON A STONE  TABLET BY THE HAND OF GOD. AND I WAS THERE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NICE GUY, MOSES. NEVER MADE GOOD ON THE MILK AND  HONEY THING. GOOD PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT FAIR. THIS COMMITTEE I'M SURE INCLUDES PEOPLE WITH THE PROPER  EXPERTISE.
A COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJOR FROM RICE UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER NAVAL AVIATOR.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT.
COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY  COMPUTER DROP OFF LINE AS I'M  ROLLING TO MY PLANE TO DROP A TORPEDO TO STOP A RUSSIAN SUBMARINE FROM LAUNCHING A NUCLEAR MISSILE AT OUR COUNTRY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I THINK THAT GUY JUST  USED THE PLOT FOR THE HUNT FOR  RED OCTOBER TO SLAG  HEALTHCARE.GOV. ANYWAY, LET'S MOVE ON TO SOMEONE ELSE. REPRESENTATIVE JOE BARTON FROM  TEXAS. WELL KNOWN FOR WANTING AMERICA, AND THIS IS TRUE, TO APOLOGIZE TO BP FOR  GETTING OUR BEACHES ON THEIR OIL, I GUESS. BARTON HAD CONCERNS BEYOND THE  HEALTHCARE'S EFFICACY.
HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THIS BE  HIPPA COMPLIANT WHEN HIPPA IS  DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE  PATIENT'S PRIVACY AND THIS  EXPLICITLY SAYS IN ORDER TO  CONTINUE, YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT  THIS CONDITION THAT YOU DON'T  HAVE PRIVACY.
Jon: THAT IS AN INTERESTING POINT. MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S HIPPA  COMPLIANT BECAUSE THE WEBSITE  DOESN'T ASK YOU FOR ACTUAL  HEALTH INFORMATION. SO YOU KNOW WHAT? I WONDER IF THERE'S ANOTHER  CONGRESS PERSON. PERHAPS A DEMOCRAT, THAT IS SO  SICK OF THIS [BLEEP] AND THIS  GUY THAT HE ANSWERS THE  QUESTION, BUT CANNOT HIDE HIS  UTTER CONTEMPT FOR JOE BARTON'S  WILLFUL IGNORANCE.
HIPPA ONLY APPLIES WHEN  THERE'S HEALTH INFORMATION BEING PROVIDED THAT'S NOT IN PLAY HERE TODAY. NO HEALTH INFORMATION IS  REQUIRED IN THE APPLICATION  PROCESS AND WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS  DON'T MATTER. SO ONCE AGAIN, HERE WE HAVE MY  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TRYING TO  SCARE EVERYBODY --
WILL YOU --
NO, I WILL NOT KNEEL TO THIS  MONKEY COURT.
THIS IS NOT A MONKEY COURT.
Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT CLIP, OTHER THAN  THE RHYTHMIC TRI-DELT JUST HAD  ENOUGH OF THESE [BLEEP]'S HEAD  ROLLING. WHATEVER. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE  REFRESHMENTS, DARLENE, YOU CAN'T BE ON THE REFRESHMENTS  COMMITTEE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU  HEARD IT BECAUSE YOU WERE  LAUGHING TOO HARD. THE OFF CAMERA CONGRESSMAN'S  DENIAL BACK AT THIS GUY THAT  THIS IS NOT A MONKEY COURT. IT'S JUST NOT!  [LAUGHTER] MONKEY COURT, OF COURSE, WAS MY  1990s MTV COURTROOM REALITY  SHOW. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, I STILL DON'T KNOW  WHY I WAS THE ONE THAT HAD TO  WEAR THE DIAPERS. ANYWAY, MONKEY COURT NOT  WITHSTANDING, THERE WAS ONE  ISSUE THAT CONGRESSMAN McKINLEY  WANTED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE OF YOU  APOLOGIZE TO THE AMERICAN  PUBLIC. ARE APOLOGIES NOT IN ORDER? I'VE NOT HEARD THE WORD "I'M  SORRY." I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S  NOT AN APOLOGY TO THE AMERICAN  PUBLIC. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW DID YOU --  [APPLAUSE] HOW DID YOU DO THAT? WHAT SORT OF WIZARDRY IS THIS? [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE MULTIPLYING! FOR THEIR PART, THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT SO MUCH OFFER WEB SITE DIFFICULTY REASONS, AS MUCH AS WEB SITE DIFFICULTY RHYMES.
LET THE GOAL BE TO FIX IT,  NOT NIX IT.
WE WANT TO FIX IT, NOT NIX  IT.
FIX IT, DON'T NIX IT.
Jon: FIX IT. DON'T NIX IT. CORRECT IT, DO NOT REJECT IT. DEBUG IT, PLEASE DO NOT UNPLUG  IT. IMPROVE IT, DON'T REMOVE IT. [LAUGHTER] REPAIR IT, NOT FORESWEAR IT.  ♪ WE'VE GOT TO SQUEEZE HER,  DON'T TEASE HER, NEVER LEAVE  HER ♪  ♪ TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS   ♪ OH, YEAH   ♪ ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO   ♪ NO, NO, NO   ♪ WE'VE GOT TO TRY   ♪ AHHHH   ♪ A LITTLE TENDERNESS  [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT WAS WEIRD. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, REPUBLICANS BIT OFF  ONE SOLUTION.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY MAY  HAVE FOUND THE ANSWER TO ALL OF  OUR TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. MR. JOHN MCAFEE. YOU MAY KNOW MR. MCAFEE AS THE  FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY THAT  BEARS HIS NAME AND SELLS  ANTI-VIRAL SOFTWARE.
JOHN MCAFEE WAS WANTED IN  CONNECTION TO THE MURDER OF AN  AMERICAN, GREG FAULK, IN BELIZE.
Jon: OKAY. WE CAN TRY THAT OR --  ♪♪  ♪ TRY A LITTLE TENDERNESS,  BABY ♪  ♪ OH, YEAH   ♪ WE'VE GOT TO PLEASE HER,  TEASE HER ♪  ♪ AHH   ♪ WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
