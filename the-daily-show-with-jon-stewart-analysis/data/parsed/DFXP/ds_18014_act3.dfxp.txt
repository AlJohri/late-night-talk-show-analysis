(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HIS NEW FAME  IS CALLED "CHASING MAVERICKS."
I WANT TO RIDE THAT WAVE. I WANT TO THAT I CAN THAT DROP.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE UNTRAINED BOYS DON'T  STEP IN THE RING WITH MIKE  TYSON, THAT'S WHY.
I CAN HANDLE IT!
YOU DON'T JUST DO IT. BUDDY, I'VE BEEN SURFING THAT  BREAK FOR 20 YEARS. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH  STRENGTH AND KNOW HOW YOU NEED  TO SURVIVE A BREAK LIKE THAT?
I'M GETTING STRONGER BY THE  DAY. I'LL HOLD MY OWN.
STRONGER BY THE DAY, HUH? OKAY, GAVE ME YOUR HAND. NOW RESIST ME. OKAY? NO, YOU'RE NOT --
Jon: OH, I'M SORRY. (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME GERARD BUTLER! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I GUESS MY FIRST THING I'M GOING  SAY TO YOU IS THIS "GRAB MY  HAND."  (LAUGHTER) RESIST ME, BUTLER! THOSE AREN'T HANDS THEY'RE LIKE  (BLEEP)ING MEAT HOOKS, JESUS! WHAT'S HAPPENING?
NOTHING, MAN, JUST -- I JUST  REALIZED HOW MUCH I MISSED MY  HAIR. I MEAN IT'S --
Jon: OH, IS THAT TRUE.
YEAH, IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK  LIKE IT WAS, MY HAIR.
Jon: YOU LIKE IT MORE  FLOWING, A LITTLE MORE  "BRAVEHEARTY."  AS MUCH -T AS IT LOOKED BLEACHED AS HELL BUT IT WAS A FUN CUT.
Jon:
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. DID YOU DO THE THINGS YOU WANTED  TO DO WITH YOUR HAIR WHEN IT WAS  THAT LONG OR NO? DID YOU GET A CONVERTIBLE AND  DRIVE LIKE THIS? (LAUGHTER)
I MOP IT HAD BATHROOM FLOOR  WITH IT.
Jon: SEE, I'M THE OPPOSITE. WHEN I GET A HAIR CUT NOW I FEEL  LIBERATED. I FEEL -- WHEN I MY HAIR GETS  TOO LONG AND I GET IT CUT I FEEL  LIKE OH, NOW, GOING ATTACK THE  DAY. MAYBE IT'S A -- I HAVE WHAT DO  YOU CALL IT OSTEOPOROSIS SO I  DON'T HAVE THE BONE DENSITY THAT  A LONG HAIR --  (LAUGHTER). YOU'RE A HALER FIGURE, PERHAPS.
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.
Jon: I CAN (BLEEP)ING TALK  ABOUT THIS THE WHOLE TIME. I'M NOT GOING TO IT WILL YOU OFF  THE HOOK AT THIS.
WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S  SOMETHING VERY FREEING ABOUT  GETTING IT SHAVED OFF. I WAS JUST WATCHING THAT THERE  GOING "OH, GOD, I HAD LONG HAIR  ONCE."
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A  QUESTION. WE'VE GOT A MONITOR THERE. GIVE ME A QUICK BUTLER SINGLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF "NICE"? (LAUGHTER)  DO YOU EVER THINK TO YOURSELF  "I'D HIT THAT. I'D HIT THAT."  (LAUGHTER)
I DO FREQUENTLY. (LAUGHTER)  LAUGH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: GIVE ME MY SINGLE. IS THAT SKIN CANCER? WHAT IS THAT? (LAUGHTER)
I'D HIT THAT, TOO.
Jon: THANK YOU, I  APPRECIATE IT, IT'S VERY  UNHITTABLE. I KNOW EVERYBODY'S ASKING YOU  ABOUT. THIS THEY'RE DOING THIS SURFING  FILM. DO WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF HIM IN  THIS CRAZY -- ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S  OUT --
THE RED BOARD THERE.
Jon: WATCH THIS. THIS IS INSANE. NOW WATCH HOW HIGH THE WATER  SUDDENLY COMES --  (AUDIENCE REACTS)  HOW HIGH IS THAT?
THAT'S OVER 30 FEET.
Jon: THAT'S A 30-FOOT WAVE  AND YOU'RE UNDERNEATH IT.
AND WHEN THE CAMERA COMES --  LOOK AT THAT. IT'S LIKE THREE MILES OF  COASTLINE AND IT'S JUST --  EVERYTHING'S WIPED OUT.
Jon: EVERYTHING'S WIPED  OUT. WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE? (LAUGHTER)
IT DOES SEEM LIKE A LOGICAL  QUESTION. I WAS ASKING THE SAME THING WHEN  I SAW THAT WAVE COMING AND I  KNEW THERE WAS NO ESCAPE I  THOUGHT HOW THE (BLEEP) DID I END UP OUT HERE?
Jon: WERE THEY FILMING? WAS THAT BEING --
WE WERE FILMING AT THE TIME. WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF  FILMING, WE'D GONE CLOSER INTO  THE ROCKS AND WE'RE JUST --  WE'RE GETTING READY FOR SOMETHING AND WE JUST SAW THIS  HUGE SET OF WAVES COMING IN AND  IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A TSUNAMI  AND THEY START GOING --
Jon: IT'S 30 FEET OF WATER. THAT'S A THREE STORY WAVE. AND WHEN YOU'RE UNDERNEATH IT,  HOW LONG ARE YOU UNDER THERE?
WELL, I WAS -- I HAD WHAT'S  CALLED A TWO-WAY HOLE BANK. SOME PEOPLE DON'T MAKE IT  THROUGH. THOSE WAVES THERE'S 18, 20  SECONDS BETWEEN THEM. PLUS THEY TAKE YOU WITH THEM. SO YOU'RE UNDERWATER GOING ALONG  WITH THE WAVES AND I DIDN'T MAKE  IT BACK UP FOR THE NEXT ONE AND  I HAD ALREADY BEEN PADDLING AND TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. SO I WAS EXHAUSTED BY THE TIME  THAT WAVE HIT.
Jon: WHO GOT -- DID YOU POP  UP? HOW DID YOU GET OUT? DID SOMEBODY REACH DOWN AND GRAB  YOU? LIKE WHAT -- DO YOU REMEMBER  GETTING OUT? WERE YOU --
YEAH, NO, I CAME UP AND I  WENT "OH, CHRIST."  THEN I SAW THE NEXT WAVE COMING  AND I WAS LIKE "OH, NOT AGAIN!" AND ONE T GUY WHO TAUGHT ME E TO  SURF WAS THERE ON A JETSKI AND  HE CAME OVER BUT THE LOOK ON  FEAR ON HIS FACE THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED HOW (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER)  AND I FEW HE WASN'T SCARED FOR  HIMSELF BUT IT WAS LIKE --
Jon: SURE, SHE HAD A  JETSKI!
EXACTLY. YEAH. OH, NICE ONE, YOU GET THE  JETSKI! SO HE HAD TO TURN AROUND BECAUSE  THE WAVE WAS COMING AND HE LEFT. (LAUGHTER)  AND I'M LIKE ALL RIGHT, HERE  COMES THE NEXT ONE. AND IT TOOK ME DOWN AGAIN. AND THEN I CAME UP AGAIN AND  THEN ONE OF THE SURRERS WHO WAS  MAYBE OVER 30 YARDS AWAY, IT WAS  ALL BLURRY NOW AND I THINK HE'S SAYING "CALM DOWN, YOU'LL BE ALL  RIGHT."  AND I'M THINKING "I'M NOT ALL  RIGHT."  SO NOW I'M AT THE ROCKS AND THE NEXT WAVE CAME AND TOOK ME DOWN  AGAIN. AND FINALLY I CAME UP AND GRANT  CAME IN AND HE GRABBED ME IN.
Jon: I THOUGHT YOU WERE  GOING TO SAY "AND THEN A GIANT  BOOT CAME DOWN AND STEPPED ON  ME."  (LAUGHTER) AT THAT POINT DID THEY SAY LIKE  "HEY, WHERE'S GERARD'S STUNT  DOUBLE?"  LIKE, DID THEY GET SOMEBODY? (LAUGHTER)
YEAH. THE INSURANCE COMPANY STEPPED IN  AND DID THAT. "GERARD, STAY ON THE SHORE."
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. WELL, IT DIDN'T HURT THE MONEY  MAKER, YOU'RE STILL ROCKING THE  -- GOOD STUFF, BABY. (APPLAUSE)  YOU'VE GOT TO SEE SOME OF THIS  STUFF. THE WAVE FOOTAGE IS RIDICULOUS. "CHASING MAVERICKS" IS IN THE  THEATERS ON FRIDAY. GERARD BUTLER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
