Jon: HELLO, WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE'S GOT A NEW FILM OUT IT'S CALLED DRAFT DAY.
I'M SORRY SONNY IS THIS A BAD TIME?
I GOTTA GO, MOM.
THIS IS THE DRAFT ANALYSIS WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS.
FIRE. ALLEY, FIRE!
WHY AM I HERE, SONNY?
BECAUSE MALIA THINKS YOU COACHED THE COWBOYS.
I DID COACH THE COWBOYS.
AND I THINK YOU WERE A BAD BABY-SITTER.
THIS CITY DESERVES A CHAMPIONSHIP AND I'M THE GUY THAT CAN DELIVER IT.
Jon: TO CLEVELAND? PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM DENIS LEARY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I HAVE TO SAY HI TO MY PEOPLE.
Jon: GO SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
MY PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SIT DOWN.
MY PEOPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAD TO STOP AND SAY HI TO MY PEOPLE, JON.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU THE PONTIFEX? WHAT WAS THAT?
IF I COULD POINT OUT IN THAT CLIP I HAVE VERY SHORT HAIR AND I'M PLAYING THE COACH OF THE CLEVELAND BROWNS.
Jon: THAT'S CORRECT.
AND NOW I HAVE VERY LONG ROCK 'N' ROLL HAIR BECAUSE I'M CURRENTLY PLAYING A ROCK STAR BECAUSE I HAVE GREAT ACTING RANGE, JON.
Jon: NO, YOU DO. IS THAT THE HAIR WAS. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING THE RON DUGUAY STORY. REMEMBER THE RANGERS?
WHY ARE THEY MAKING THAT? I BRING IT UP, JON BECAUSE YOU MADE A MOVIE THIS PAST YEAR THAT YOU DIRECTED THAT I'M NOT IN.
Jon: WELL, BECAUSE I WAS MAKING A FILM, NOT A MOVIE.
OH. [AUDIENCE REACTS]
Jon: I WAS TRYING TO CLASS IT UP A LITTLE BIT.
WITH SERIOUS ACTORS.
Jon: JUST ACTORS PEOPLE WHO COULD ACT.
YEAH, YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] CAN I GO BACK TO THE HAIR CLIP AGAIN. I DO A LOT OF MY ACTING WITH MY HAIR. IT'S ONE OF MY GIFTS.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET A PERM? WHAT DID THEY --
FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S LIKE DENIRO IN RAGING BULL. LET ME JUST POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS. YOU HAVE TO GROW IT OUT, OKAY?
Jon: SURE.
THEN FOR A WHILE, FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. YOU HAVE TO REALLY LET IT GROW.
Jon: OR WALK INTO LIKE A SAUNA, I GUESS COULD YOU DO.
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO A HAIR SALON. I WENT TO AN ACTUAL HAIR SALON AND HAD IT CUT BY A PROFESSIONAL HAIR STYLIST.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH. I REMEMBER BEING REALLY IMPRESSED WITH ROBERT DENIRO IN RAGING BULL BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID WITH HIS HAIR. I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY AWESOME.
THAT'S BEEN DONE. I'M DOINGG A HAIR THING. OKAY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE HAIR TO BEGIN WITH, FIRST OF ALL. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION.
Jon: PLEASE. ASK ME A QUESTION.
WHO IS IN THE MOVIE THAT YOU DIRECTED. WHAT KIND OF PARTS?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS CAST. GAEL GARCIA BERNAL IS IN IT.
WHO'S A FANTASTIC ACTOR. DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS? GREAT.
Jon: SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO, WE'VE GOT YOUR HALUK BILGINER, WE'VE GOT YOUR NASSER FARIS.
OKAY SO THERE'S -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THERE'S ONE GUY IN THE BACK. SO THERE'S IS NO AMERICAN CHARACTERS IN MOVIE AT ALL.
Jon: IT TAKES PLACE IN IRAN. SO I'M GOING TO GO WITH NO. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S IN IRAN IN 2009. MAZIAR, YOU KNOW MAZIAR. HE'S THE JOURNALIST THAT GOT ARRESTED IN IRAN IN 2009. HELD IN CAPTIVITY FOR FOUR MONTHS. IT'S ABOUT THAT. IT TAKES PLACE IN IRAN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: I WOULD HAVE USED YOU IN IT IF IN LIKE WHEN HE WAS IN IRAN HE WAS LIKE YEAH, AND THERE WAS THIS ONE (bleep) IRISH GUY.
BY THE WAY WAS IT SO HARD THAT THERE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ONE (bleep) IRISH GUY AT THE BAR?
Jon: I WILL SAY THIS I DID WRITE IN A PART FOR SHAQUILLE O'NEAL BUT I JUST NEEDED A GENIE TO GET US OUT OF A JAM AT THE END OF THE MOVIE. HE COMES IN AS HIS CHARACTER IN SHAZAM.
ARE YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW WHEN I SEE THE MOVIE, WHAT IS THE NAME OF MOVIE?
Jon: ROSEWATER.
WHEN I SEE ROSEWATER.
Jon: WHEN YOU PAY FULL PRICE TO SEE ROSEWATER.
WHEN I PAY FULL PRICE TO SEE ROSEWATER, THERE WILL NOT BE ONE ENGLISH SPEAKING CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE? NOT A BRITISH GUY, NO AMERICAN GUY.
Jon: THEY ALL SPEAK ENGLISH.
THERE'S NO BRITISH GUYS OR IRISH GUYS?
Jon: THERE ARE SOME BRITISH GUYS?
WHO ARE THEY PLAY SOMETHING IN.
Jon: THEY ARE PLAYED BY BRITISH GUYS. I CAN'T DO AN IRISH GUY AS A BRITISH GUY. DO YOU KNOW THE TENSION ON THE SET THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED? I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT. YOU SHOW UP IN GREEN AND SOMEONE ELSE IN ORANGE AND IT THE WHOLE (bleep) THING GOES UP IN FLAMES. I DON'T WANT THAT. I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. THIS IS ABOUT IRAN, A PEACEFUL COUNTRY.
DID YOU NOT WRITE THIS SCRIPT YOURSELF? IT WAS BASED ON A BOOK. TRUE STORY.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU WROTE THE SCRIPT AND IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU THAT MAYBE EVEN JUST BOX OFFICE-WISE IT WOULD HELP TO YOU HAVE ONE IRISH AMERICAN CHARACTER THAT THE AUDIENCE COULD RELATE TO. WHEN I CAME OUT PEOPLE WERE HIGH FIVING ME. YOU NAMED THE PEOPLE IN YOUR CAST AND ONE GUY WENT HUH!
Jon: YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET THIS THING FINANCED IT WAS NOT EASY. IT'S A TOUGH SELL. I REMEMBER SITTING WITH A FINANCIER AND THEY SAID TO ME, GET ME A GUY FROM DUMBO DROP AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. THEN I CAN SELL THIS THING. YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO GO DUMBO DROP, DID YOU? YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO GO DUMBO DROP?
I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HIM. I SAT HERE AND I DID NOT SEE DUMBO DROP COMING. I WAS SO FOOLED. I WAS LIKE I WONDER WHERE HE'S GOING AND OF COURSE, WE WENT TO DUMBO DROP. WE HAVE TO GO.
Jon: IS THIS MOVIE GOOD?
WHICH MOVIE?
Jon: DRAFT DAY THE  ONE YOU ARE IN.
WELL I HAVE A NUMBER OF MOVIES, JON. SHOW ME MY RANK. I HAVE DRAFT DAY. DRAFT DAY IS A FOOTBALL MOVIE THAT OPENS ON FRIDAY WITH ME,JENNIFER GARNER AND KEVIN COSTER. SPIDERMAN 2 COMES OUT IN MAY, MAY 2. AND I ALSO HAVE A TV SHOW CALLED SIRENS I'M WRITING AND PRODUCING THAT'S ON USA AND MORE PEOPLE KNOW THAT THAN KNOW THE MEMBERS OF THE CAST OF YOUR MOVIE.
Jon: OH SON OF A (bleep). DENIS LEARY, EVERYBODY.
