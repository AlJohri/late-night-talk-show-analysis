Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT ONE OF OUR FAVORITES COLIN FIRTH WILL BE HERE PROMOTING HIS WONDERFUL NEW FILM. IT'S CALLED "THE CONTINUING'S SPEECH." IF I MAY JUST DO A PIECE FROM IT. AGAIN, I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT A GREAT ACTOR. [LAUGHTER] BUT I SAW THE FILM AND I WAS SO MOVED BY IT. THE ONE SCENE WHERE HE ADDRESSES THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORLD WAR II BRINGING A  CERTAIN SOLACE HE STAYED WITH THEM IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE AS HE COULD HAVE GONE TO THE COUNTRY  WHERE THE GERMANS WERE BOMBING IT. WENT LIKE THIS. ARWOOOOO, THE BOMBS, OOOOH. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE WILL BE MISSED. FOLKS, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A CERTAIN SOMETHING ABOUT ME TONIGHT. A SPRING IN MY STEP, A CERTAIN TWINKLE IN LET'S GO WITH MY PANTS. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS WHY:  I HAVE NO PROBLEMS SAYING TO YOU WHAT I'VE BEEN SUFFERING WITH. FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS , THOSE OF US IN THE IPHONE COMMUNITY HAVE  SACRIFICED ONE THING FOR THE ABILITY TO CARRY AROUND EVERY PHOTOGRAPH WE'VE EVER TAKEN OR  SONG WE'VE LISTENED TO OR HOME VIDEO OR COMPASS. WE'VE SACRIFICED THE ABILITY TO MAKE PHONECALLS. [LAUGHTER] FOR YEARS -- FOR YEARS -- FOR YEARS STRUGGLING WITH THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR ALMOST PHONE. [LAUGHTER] WELL, OUR LONG NATIONAL MIGHT MAYOR -- NIGHTMARE MAY SOON BE OVER.
TODAY WE'RE EXTREMELY GREATIFIED, AND I CAN'T THINK OF  A BETTER WORD, TO ANNOUNCE THAT EARLY NEXT MONTH THE iPHONE 4 BE PART OF THE GRIT VERIZON  PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS.
Jon: FREEDOM! FREEDOM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] FREEDOM ACTUALLY TO SWITCH PROVIDERS. REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN THAT. HOW BAD HAS IT BEEN? FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO CARRY NOT ONLY MY iPHONE BUT A SECOND PHONE --  [LAUGHTER] -- THAT I WOULD USE AS A PHONE --  [LAUGHTER] -- OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE SOME DRAWBACKS TO THIS PHONE. FIRST OF ALL, MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WOULD LIKE IT BACK. [LAUGHTER] AND WHILE THE RECEPTION IS CRYSTAL CLEAR IT ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO CALL UNIFORMS AND CARRIES. [LAUGHTER] DOCTOR UNICORNS AND FAIRIES. [LAUGHTER] IT'S A LITTLE BULKY. THIS IS HOW BAD IT'S BEEN. THIS IS HOW I'VE HAD TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES. HERE IS WHAT I WOULD DO. TO LET'S SAY STEPHEN COLBERT. GREAT SHOW LAST NIGHT, URDA-MAN. THEN I PUT LIKE AN EMOTICON INDICATING AMUSEMENT AS WELL AS AFFECTION. XXOO. AND NOW I'M READY TO SEND MY TEXT MESSAGE. BOY! [LAUGHTER]
ANOTHER TEXT MESSAGE, MR. S.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. BRING THIS PHONE TO MR. STEPHEN COLBERT AS FAST AS YOUR LEGS WILL CARRY YOU. AS FAST AS YOUR LEGS WILL CARRY YOU, BOY!
BUT, SIR, MY POLIO. MR. COLBERT RESIDES AT THE TOP OF A TALL MOUNTAIN WITH FEW FOOTHOLES AND THERE'S A BLIZZARD COMING.
Jon: THEN YOU BEST HURRY BOY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHICH REMINDS ME, AND NOW TO TEXT MOTHER. YOU SEE? TEXTING IS COSTING ME A FOR THE FORTUNE. EACH TEXT COSTS ME $400 NOT TO AMONGST POURAGE FOR MY RUNNER. WE TURN NOW LIVE TO JOL JOHN OLIVER AT THE SITE OF TODAY'S VERIZON ANNOUNCEMENT. JOHN, TELL US -- WHAT -- WHAT IS --  [LAUGHTER] WHAT DOES THE SCENE LOOK LIKE DOWN THERE?
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, JON. IT'S [BREAKING UP] FANTASTIC OCCASION.
Jon: JOHN, WHY IS THERE A DELAY? YOU ARE IN COLUMBUS CIRCLE? IT'S FIVE BLOCKS AWAY.
I'M TRANSMITTING FROM MY IPHONE. I HAVEN'T SWITCHED OVER CONTRACTS YET.
Jon: YOU GOOD AND I'LL --
YOU GO. YOU SPEAK --
Jon: IN THE DELAY I'M -- I HEAR --
YOU DROPPED OUT. WHAT IS THAT?
Jon: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.
LET ME SPEAK.
Jon: OKAY. OKAY.
I'LL SPEAK. JON, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING --  [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST JOHN OLIVER. WE LOST JOHN OLIVER. OKAY. HE'S BACK. HE'S BACK.
SORRY, JON. SORRY I'M BACK. I THINK I MUST HAVE LOOKED AT A TUNNEL. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, TODAY, JON, I FILED THIS REPORT.
Jon: GRIT.
AMERICA --
Jon: GREAT.
AMERICA SUFFERED FOR FAR TOO LONG.
I GET NO SERVICE OVER HERE BUT SOME IN THE DINING ROOM.
YOU HAVE TO WALK -- HOW MANY PACES IS THAT?
ABOUT FIVE OR --
FIVE OR SIX WHOLE PACES.
YES.
AND THE VICTIMS WERE TOO MANY TO COUNT.
IT DOES NOT WORK AS A TELEPHONE.
CALLS DROPPED ALL THE TIME.
I HATE AT&T. THEY ARE (bleep).
WHAT DOES IT SEEM LIKE LIVING UNDER THE TYRANNY OF THIS REGIME.
THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY.
AT&T (bleep) SERVICE.
WE'RE TECHNOLOGY HOSTAGE.
THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT OVERSTATING IT.
IT'S LIKE BEING A SLAVE.
WHY NOT THROW THAT IN THERE AS WELL? THE PEOPLE WERE READY TO RISE UP AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSOR. RIGHT? CAN WE HEAR THAT AT&T OR DO WE NEED TO TURN IT UP LOUDER. THERE WAS NO TELLING WHEN OR IF THE LIBERATORS WOULD ARRIVE.
THERE ARE KNOWN KNOWNS AND THINGS WE KNOW. THERE WE KNOW THERE ARE THINGS WE DO NOT KNOW.
SUDDENLY BEFORE ANYONE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE MOMENT OF LIBERATION WAS A AT HAND AND I  WAS THERE AS VERIZON'S OWN DAVID PATREAUS TOOK THE STAGE.
EARLY NEXT MONTH THE iPHONE 4 WILL BE PART OF VERIZON WIRELESS PORT MANOLO OF --  PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS.
YEAH (bleep). THANK YOU. WOO.
WITH THAT THERE WAS AN OUTPOURING OF EMOTION IN THE STREETS.
I'M VERY HAPPY. I'M VERY HAPPY THAT VERIZON IS DOING THIS.
TAKING A CUE FROM HISTORY CROWDS EMBRACES THEIR NEW FREEDOM.
DOWN WITH TYRANNY.
1-11-11, A DAY THAT WILL BE FOREVER AS VZ DAY. -- FOREVER BE KNOWN AS VD DAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, JON, AS YOU CAN SEE A VERY EMOTIONAL DAY. JUBILATION, HOPE. NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL MOVE SLIGHTLY TO SCRATCH AN ITCH --
Jon: NO! SUN OF A -- -- SON OF
