(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT? JOHN OLIVER INVESTIGATES IN HIS  NEW INVESTIGATION, INVESTIGATING  INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM
Reporter: IN THE POST 9/11  WORLD I VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT  AMERICANS ARE EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING OVERSEAS. THAT'S WHAT MAKES REPORTERS LIKE  CNN'S INDISPENSABLE. A NAVY SEAL RESERVIST HAS  TRACKED PIRATES OFF THE COAST OF  INDONESIA, CRAWLED THROUGH DRUG TUNNELS IN MEXICO AND JOURNEYED  TO WHEREVER THE [BLEEP] THIS IS
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S  GOING ON IN THE WORLD, YOU  ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET OUT INTO THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T DO IT FROM BEHIND A  DESK.
Reporter: WHAT HAVE YOU GOT  COMING UP NEXT?
WEST AFRICA. YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE GOVERNMENT  THAT'S EFFECTIVELY BEING RUN BY  DRUG CARTELS FROM SOUTH AMERICA
Reporter: YOU CAN LOOK  FORWARD TO THAT STORY AIRING ON  CNN VERY SOON.
I'M NOT WORKING AT CNN  ANYMORE. CNN ELIMINATED ITS ENTIRE  INVESTIGATIVE UNIT
Reporter: WHAT? THEY'VE ELIMINATED THE  DEPARTMENT THAT I WAS WORKING  FOR WHERE I WAS DOING THOSE INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE  REPORTS
Reporter: CNN, THE WORLDWIDE  LEADER IN NEWS, HAS ELIMINATED  ITS INVESTIGATIVE NEWS  DEPARTMENT?
YES. Reporter: I'M JUST LETTING  THAT SINK IN A SECOND. IT'S TAKING A WHILE. IT'S JUST GOING IN. HOLY [BLEEP]. YET LAST SPRING CNN DISMISSED  ALMOST THEIR ENTIRE SPECIAL  INVESTIGATIVE DOCUMENTARY DOCUMENTARY UNIT. I SPOKE TO PROFESSIONAL MEDIA  ANALYST BRAD ATGATE WHO OFFERS  IN FAVOR OF TALKING HEADS OVER BOOTS ON THE GROUND REPORTING  CNN IS FINALLY RAISING ITSELF UP  TO MEET THE LOW STANDARDS OF ITS COMPETITORS
SAD TO SAY INVESTIGATIVE  JOURNALISM IS ON THE WAY OUT. IT'S USUALLY THE FIRST ONE TO GO  BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PROFIT CENTER
Reporter: LET'S SAY I KNEW AN  INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST DOING  AN INVESTIGATION ON A HAVEN FOR DRUG SMUGGLING. DOES THAT SOUND INTERESTING?
NO. Reporter: THAT DOESN'T SOUND  LIKE AN INTERESTING STORY
YOU COULD STAY IN THE UNITED  STATES AND DO THAT
Reporter: RIGHT. BUT IT'S A GOOD STORY, BRAD
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE  ARE A LOT OF GOOD STORIES OUT  THERE THAT WE'LL NEVER KNOW.
Reporter: WE'LL NEVER KNOW  BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU SAY  THEY'RE NOT PROFITABLE.
EXACTLY. Reporter: BECAUSE YOU'RE  SAYING EXACTLY LIKE THAT'S A  GOOD THING
YEAH. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO FLY TO SOME  REMOTE LOCATION, YOU KNOW, TO  INTERVIEW SOMEONE. YOU CAN JUST SIT AND YOU SKYPE  AND SAVE MONEY THAT WAY.
Reporter: BUT, BRAD, I DON'T  KNOW HOW MANY CHILD SOLDIERS IN  SIERRA LEONE YOU SKYPE
TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD  FOR INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM,  THOSE DAYS ARE GONE. IT'S JUST TOO COSTLY
Reporter: IT'S TRUE. SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON  AN INVESTIGATION IN AFRICA IS  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY  SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON  VITAL REPORTING TOOLS LIKE HOLOGRAM JOURNALISTS.
JESSICA YELLIN WORKS AT CNN. WHY DO THEY NEED A HOLOGRAM OF  HER?
Reporter: THAT WAS THE  STUPIDEST QUESTION I'VE EVER  HEARD. BECAUSE THE HOLOGRAM IS COOLER. LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU A HOLOGRAM?
OH, NO. Reporter: YOU'RE A REAL  REPORTER. THAT'S MUCH LESS GOOD. IT SEEMS THERE'S NO PLACE FOR  HIM IN THIS MODERN NEWS  LANDSCAPE. TODAY HE SUPPLEMENTS HIS INCOME  AS A TRAINER WAITING FOR THE  OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH ANOTHER NEWS ORGANIZATION.
I ACTUALLY HAVE AN  EXTRAORDINARY JOB
Reporter: THAT'S GREAT. WHERE IS THAT?
I WORK AT NEWS ROOM  Reporter: WHICH ONE? THE NEWS ROOM. THE HBO SHOW ABOUT THE NEWS  INDUSTRY. AND I PITCH THEM IDEAS ABOUT  INVESTIGATIVE STORIES. AND THEN THEY TAKE THOSE  REAL-WORLD IDEAS AND THEY INJECT  THEM INTO THE PLOT LINES OF THE  SHOW.
Reporter: NO, NO, NO. THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT. PLEASE TELL ME THAT THE ONLY  NEWS ROOM HIRING PEOPLE LIKE HIM  IS NOT A PRETEND ONE. EXCUSE ME.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? Reporter: SORRY TO INTERRUPT  BUT I HAVE TO CHECK SOMETHING. DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS IN
HE WORKS HERE  Reporter: REALLY? I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION  THEN. ARE YOU REAL? BECAUSE I REALLY NEED YOU TO BE  REAL.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? NOT REALLY  Reporter: EXECUTIVE PRODUCER  McKENZIE, RIGHT?
NO, I'M EMILY. THAT'S TRUE. SHE WAS IN SHUTTER ISLAND
Reporter: SHUT UP  THIS IS STAGE 7. IT'S THE SET. LOOK UP. THERE'S NO CEILING.
Reporter: THERE IS NO WAY I'M  LOOKING UP THERE. OUR NEWS IS FROM A YEAR AGO. LOOK AT THE MONITORS. ROMNEY LOSING GROUND TO  SANTORUM. HOLY [BLEEP]. THAT IS DEPRESSING. LOOK, BEFORE WE LEAVE, WOULD YOU  MIND DOING AN INSPIRATIONAL SORT  OF SPEECH OVER SOARING MUSIC JUST TO MAKE ME FEEL LIKE  THERE'S AT LEAST SOME HOPE.
SURE. JUST BECAUSE NEWS NIGHT ISN'T  REAL DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE. TELEVISION NEWS IS A STRUGGLE  BETWEEN REPORTERS WHO SEE  JOURNALISM AS A SACRED BLESSING AND A CORPORATE CULTURE THAT  EXPLOITS THE WORST IN HUMAN  NATURE, DUMBS DOWN THE NATIONAL  CONVERSATION. BUT IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT  YOU'RE DOING, IT WON'T MATTER IF  YOU'RE ON CNN, FOX OR YOU-TUBE, PEOPLE WILL FIND YOU.
Reporter: WOW. WOULD YOU MIND GIVING ME A HUG?
GET OUT. YOU CAN LEAVE THROUGH THE OPEN  SPACE WHERE THERE'S SUPPOSED TO  BE A WALL.
Reporter: MAKES SENSE. LET'S GO. DON'T WORRY, AMERICA. IN THE FICTIONAL WORLD  INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IS  ALIVE AND WELL. IT'S ONLY IN THE REAL WORLD  WHERE IT'S COMPLETELY [BLEEP].
