Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A COMEDIAN. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE TODD GLASS SITUATION: A BUNCH OF LIES ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE AND A BUNCH OF TRUE STORIES ABOUT MY 30-YEAR CAREER IN STAND-UP COMEDY." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM THE VERY FUNNY TODD GLASS. YOUNG MAN.
YOU LIKE THE WAY I WALK OUT?
Jon: WELL DONE, SIR.
THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU.
Jon: RESPECT.
LOOK AT THIS.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR, WELL DONE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE TODD GLASS SITUATION. NOW...
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DRINK WATER, IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE? I WANT YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.
I DO FEEL COMFORTABLE.
Jon: I WANT YOU TO BE A GOOD GUEST. WE HAVE, WE WORKED TOGETHER MANY YEARS AGO. YOU WERE ALWAYS ONE OF THE TOP COMICS, FUNNY AS HELL, WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE, WHAT YOU HAVE OUT IN THIS BOOK IS THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU. MOST COMEDIANS ARE HIDING HOW MUCH THEY DRINK. YOU ON THE OTHER HAND HAD A DIFFERENT SITUATION GOING ON.
YES.
Jon: WHAT WAS GOING ON?
WELL, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT, JON.
Jon: SURE.
AND I TOLD YOUR PRODUCER I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
Jon: OH SURE, LET ME TAKE, LET ME JUST PUT THIS HERE...
AND YOU [BLEEPED] DO THE SAME THING WITH ALL YOUR GUESTS.
Jon: I'M SO SORRY.
I'M HERE TO PROMOTE MY APPEARANCE AT THE D.C. IMPROV. THAT'S IT.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. TELL US ABOUT THE PAKISTAN-AFGHANISTAN CONFLICT. THAT'S ALL I WANT TO KNOW.
YEAH WELL, ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I... A LOT OF MY COMEDIAN FRIENDS KNEW THAT I WAS SORT OF IN THE CLOSET, WHICH IS A TERM I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT. I HAVE AFFECTIONATELY SAID THAT I WOULD RATHER IT BE SOMETHING TOUGHER LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE BUSTING OUT OF THE SHED OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW.
Jon: THERE YOU GO.
YEAH. STILL GOT A LITTLE OF...
Jon: BOOM, YEAH.
I'M STILL A GUY, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT SOUND SO FEMININE. SO, SO YEAH ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, AND YOU KNOW, I WAS, BEFORE THE SHOW WE WERE SAYING THAT IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE AS I'M PROMOTING THE BOOK, I'M TALKING ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, BUT BEFORE I DIDN'T WANT TO COME OUT BECAUSE I WAS REALLY AFRAID IT WOULD BECOME MY IDENTITY. YOU KNOW. AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY BECOME MY IDENTITY, WHICH IT HASN'T.
Jon: SO YOU WERE, YOU KNOW, SO NATURAL ON STAGE, SO CHARISMATIC, SO FUNNY, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE AS A PERFORMER, NOT BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS LIKE THE WHOLE OF YOURSELF ON STAGE. WAS THAT EXHAUSTING AS A PERFORMER, AS SOMEONE WHO EVEN WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE CONFUSION YOU FACED ABOUT IT OR NOT WANTING THAT TO BE YOUR IDENTITY. WAS THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT PART?
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WAS BECAUSE I COULD NEVER TALK ABOUT IT. I MEAN, I COULDN'T EVEN... LIKE IF I GOT IN AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEONE I WAS DATING, WHICH WAS CHRIS, WHO IS HERE TONIGHT, AND HE'S SO NERVOUS, HE SAYS, DON'T TALK ABOUT MY NAME ON THE SHOW, MY FRIENDS IN FLORIDA WILL FIND OUT.
Jon: WELL, HOW MANY CHRISES CAN THERE BE IN FLORIDA?
RIGHT, RIGHT. THERE'S ONE. IT'S HIM, EVERYBODY. [LAUGHTER] SO, I KNOW HE HATES THAT. BUT, YEAH, BECAUSE ON STAGE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD TELL STORIES ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND. I HAD MORE STORIES ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND FROM A GUY THAN GUYS THAT HAD GIRLFRIENDS, BUT THEY WERE TRUE STORIES. I JUST SWITCHED THE SEX. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
WHICH PROVES HOW THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE THE SAME.
Jon: IT'S UNIVERSAL.
BECAUSE NEVER ONCE DID I TELL A STORY WHICH WAS ABOUT A GUY BUT SAYING IT WAS A GIRL AND THE AUDIENCE WENT, THAT'S WEIRD. YOU KNOW. WE WOULD ALWAYS JOKE THAT THE ONLY TIME I WOULD GET CAUGHT IN THAT IS ON A SPECIFIC SITUATION LIKE IF I SAID, YOU KNOW, I'M AT THE AIRPORT AND I HAD THE USE THE BATHROOM AND I WAS TALKING TO MY GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS PEEING NEXT TO ME. WAIT A SECOND.
Jon: YEAH, I COULD SEE THAT BEING PROBLEMATIC.
YEAH, THEN I WOULD GET CAUGHT.
Jon: DID YOU, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT YOU, SO YOU'VE GOT THIS LIVING SITUATION. YOU'RE LIVING WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND CHRIS, AND THEN A WOMAN.
I LIKE TO SAY, WHAT I LIKE THE SAY IS PARTNER IN CRIME.
PARTNER IN CRIME.
AND OUR CRIME IS WE DISOBEY A FAKE GOD.
Jon: WELL, THAT WORKS OUT. THAT'S FINE.
HUH? THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL... WHAT IS THE FEELING? WHAT IS... IS THERE A SENSE OF UNBURDENING? IS THERE A SENSE OF... WHAT IS IT YOU'RE FEELING? ARE YOU STILL CONFLICTED? ARE YOU NOT CONFLICTED?
NO, NO, IT'S...
DO YOU FEEL FREE? WHAT'S THE FEELING?
IT'S, IT'S, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS HAPPY BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I REALLY WAS, YOU KNOW, BUT, JON, IT'S SO MUCH BETTER. IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING, EVEN CASUALLY TO A FRIEND, AND I HAVE A PODCAST. SOME OF THE KIDS THAT WORK ON IT ARE LIKE 20, 21 YEARS OLD.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT, NOT EVEN IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS, YOU KNOW, JUST HONEST CONVERSATIONS, YOU KNOW. AND IT'S SO MUCH BETTER.
Jon: YEAH.
IT REALLY IS A BETTER WAY. THE PLATE'S SPINNING. I THINK WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE, DON'T REALIZE THE PLATE SPINNING THAT GOES ON WITH HIDING IT. LIKE WHEN WE WOULD HAVE DINNER PARTIES, I TRIED TO TOUGHEN IT UP, TAKE OUT THE PARTY PART, IT SOUNDS GAY. DINNERS. WE HAD DINNERS! WE ATE STEAK.
Jon: HUNGRY MAN DINNERS.
WE DID COKE, WE COKED AND ATE A LOT OF [BLEEPED]. [LAUGHTER] WE'D BE LIKE, WHO KNOWS? WHO DOESN'T KNOW. LIKE, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU NOW...
Jon: YEAH. I LIKE TO... I DON'T LIKE TO COOK. BUT, I LIKE, I LIKE THE LOOK OF A SET TABLE. LIKE IF YOU'RE HAVING A BIG DINNER.
Jon: YEAH. MAKE IT LOOK NICE.
I LIKE THE LOOK OF IT. I LIKE TO DO IT. YOU KNOW, NO SODA CANS. BUT, I WOULD BE SO MORTIFIED THAT MY FRIENDS WOULD FIGURE ME OUT, THAT WE HAD A FRIEND ANDREA AND I WOULD SAY, BEFORE EVERYONE CAME OVER, IT WAS LIKE I WAS INTERROGATING HER. I WOULD GO, ANDREA, NOW PEOPLE ASK, WHO SET THE TABLE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
AND SHE'D BE LIKE, I SAY I SET IT. AND I'D GO, YEAH, AND DON'T DO IT LIKE YOU DID IT LAST TIME AND THEN LAUGH ABOUT IT AND SAY IT'S NO BIG DEAL. AND THEN REMEMBER ONE TIME, THIS IS SO TRUE AND IT'S SO EMBARRASSING NOW IN HINDSIGHT.
Jon: YEAH.
SHE TOLD SOMEONE, SHE GOES, OH, TODD SAID HE DOESN'T WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW. I'M NOT KIDDING YOU. THE NEXT DAY, I'M LIKE WHY THE [BLEEPED] DID YOU DO, THAT ANDREA? I TOLD YOU NOT TO SAY THAT. SO THERE YOU GO.
Jon: IT'S TOUGH, MAN. WELL, I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU, AND THE NICE THING IS YOU'RE THE SAME GUY AS YOU WERE BACK THEN, AND HILARIOUS AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF ALL YOUR PEERS. SO.
COOL.
Jon: WHAT THE HELL.
THANK YOU.
