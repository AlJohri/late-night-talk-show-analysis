(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, AS YOU REMEMBER, I THINK IT WAS LAST MONTH SETH ROGEN AND JAMES FRANCO'S FILM "THE INTERVIEW" OPENED TO WELL, ONE PARTICULARLY NASTY REVIEW.
"THE INTERVIEW" PORTRAYS A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE KIM JUNG-UN. SONY PICTURES THE STUDIO THAT MADE THE FILM HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF A LARGE SCALE HACK.
THE HACKER HAS THREATENED TO LAUNCH 9/11 STYLE ATTACK ON THEATRES THAT SCREENED THE MOVIE.
THE COMEDY ALLEGEDLY TARGETED BY NORTH KOREAN HACKERS, SONY INITIALLY CANCELED THE MOVIE'S RELEASE.
CANCELED! WELL, LISTEN NORTH KOREA, YOU CAN MESS WITH A LOT OF THINGS -- OUR POSTAL SYSTEM, OUR WATER SUPPLY. BUT WHEN YOU START (BLEEP) WITH OUR HOLIDAY RELEASES, THE PRECIOUS CINEMATIC DELIGHTS WE PARTAKE IN TO AVOID HAVING TO TALK TO OUR FAMILIES, YOU HAVE STEPPED ON A LANDMINE.
THE FIRST PENALTY ISSUED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER THE HACK ON SONY PICTURES.
A NEW SET OF SANCTIONS -- .
Jon: BOOM, MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOTHER [BLEEP], POW, SANCTION, POW! (APPLAUSE) THE QUESTION NOW IS WHAT SHAPE THESE NEW SANCTIONS WILL TAKE. PERHAPS WE COULD RESTRICT TRANSFERS OF CASH AND TRAVEL.
SANCTIONS INCLUDE TARGETING THE ELICIT ACTIVITIES OF NORTH KOREAN DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL, NORTH KOREAN BANKING RELATIONSHIPS, ELICIT TRANSERS OF BULK CASH AND NEW TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS.
Jon: I GUESS WE ALREADY DID THAT. MAYBE WE COULD STOP NORTH KOREA FROM SMUGGLING ARMS INTO --
STATES WILL NOW HAVE NEW AUTHORITIES TO INSPECT CARGO AND STOP NORTH KOREAN ARM SMUGGLING AND PROLIFERATION.
Jon: [BLEEP]. ALL RIGHT, WE DID THAT ONE. I GOT IT. WHY DON'T WE STOP NORTH KOREA FROM SMUGGLING FANCY TREATS IN LIKE OUR SPECIALTY LOBSTER NEWBURG OR OUR PALL MALLS?
SANCTION AIMED AT NORTH KOREAN'S ELITE WHO MAY SMUGGLE EXOTIC FOOD OR CIGARETTES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT SO, WE ALREADY HAVE SANCTIONS SO TOUGH NOBODY THERE CAN GET GOUT OR LUNG CANCER. WHAT NEW PUNISHMENTS ARE EVEN LEFT?
THE BIG SANCTION HERE IS BARRING THESE NORTH KOREAN ENTITIES FROM THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. ONE IS THE RGB, THIS IS NORTH KOREA'S KGB. ANOTHER ONE IS KOMID, A BIG ARMS DEALER FOR THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE THIRD ANOTHER TRADING CORPORATION TIED TO ITS DEFENSE INDUSTRY.
Jon: I JUST WANT TO INTERRUPT VERY QUICKLY. SO IN ALL THE SANCTIONS WE HAD ON NORTH KOREA, NORTH KOREA'S KGB AND THEIR ARMS DEALERS WERE STILL ALLOWED TO USE OUR BANKING SYSTEM? (LAUGHTER) NOT THAT ON AVERAGE THEY DIDN'T MAKE OUR BANKING SYSTEM LESS EVIL, BUT  STILL -- NORTH KOREA IS OUR WORST ENEMY ON EARTH AND THEY ARE STILL ALLOWED TO USE OUR ATMs? LOOK, NORTH KOREA WAS ALREADY THE WORLD CAPITAL OF HAVING NO CAPITAL. IF WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE ABOUT THIS SONY HACK, WE GOT TO MAKE KIM JUNG-UN'S QUAKE IN HIS VERY TINY YET EXPENSIVE BOOTS.
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS JUST THE FIRST ROUND OF PAYBACK FOR THE CYBERATTACKS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA STILL CONSIDERS WHETHER TO PLACE NORTH KOREA BACK ON ITS LIST OF STATES THAT SPONSORED TERRORISM.
Jon: YOU MADE THE LIST, BUDDY. THAT GOES ON YOUR PERMANENT RECORD. GOOD LUCK KIM JUNG-UN GETTING INTO OBERLIN'S PRE-MED PROGRAM NOW. (LAUGHTER) NOT SURE WHAT THE STATE SPONSORED TERROR LIST IS GOING TO ACCOMPLISH EITHER THERE, DOES THAT MEAN ISIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR UNIFORMS THAT SAY NORTH KOREA ON THEM? IS THAT -- I GUESS OUR ANGER IS NO SURPRISE. THESE HACKERS VIOLATED OUR PRIVACY. THEY READ OUR E-MAILS. WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY DOES THAT.
NEW DOCUMENTS FROM ED SNOWDEN AND THEY SHOW THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ILLEGALLY READING OUR E-MAILS.
THE GOVERNMENT IS SPYING ON OUR E-MAILS.
THE E-MAILS OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
WHY WAS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY READING THEIR E-MAILS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TOUCHE! WELL AT LEAST WHEN WE SPY ON US, WE HAVE THE DECENCY NOT TO LEAK MEAN [BLEEP] ABOUT ANGELINA JOLIE. MONSTERS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
