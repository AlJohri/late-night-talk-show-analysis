( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. EARLIER THIS WEEK, ONE OF  AMERICA'S MOST PROMINENT  POLITICIANS HAD SOME BIG NEWS.
SHE IS THE MOST TRAVELED  SECRETARY OF STATE IN U.S. HISTORY, BUT THERE WAS ONE PLACE  HILLARY CLINTON HAD YET TO GO  UNTIL NOW.
John: THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE  SHOOTING HER INTO ORBIT. ( LAUGHTER )  THIS SUMMER, HILLARY CLINTON IS  SECRETARY OF SPACE. ( LAUGHTER )  UNLESS, UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING  EVEN MORE UN-NEWSWORTHY.
HILLARY CLINTON HAS ARRIVED,  ON TWITTER.
CLINTON IS TAKING TWITTER BY  STORM. THE FORPER SECRETARY OF STATE,  SENATOR, AND FIRST LADY ALSO  DESCRIBED HERSELF AS WIFE, MOM, LAWYER, AND-- GET THIS-- HAIR  ICON AND PANTSUIT AFICIONADO. MOST TELLING OF ALL IN CLINTON'S  TWITTER BIO, T.B.D.
John: OH! T.B.D. YOU BIG TEASE. WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY BE  REFERRING TO? IS IT PRESIDENT OR IS IT-- THERE  IS LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR  SOCIAL MEDIA CORRESPONDENT  JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). CAN YOU PUT THE PHONE DOWN,  PLEASE?
OH, NO, NO. I CAN DO BOTH.
John: SERIOUSLY, PUT IT  DOWN.
JON STEWART LETS ME TEXT AND  DO CHATS.
John: IF HILLARY IS RUNNING  IN 2016, HOW CAN TWITTER HELP  HER?
WELL, JOHN, TWIT SER A  MICROBLOGGING INTERNET SERVICE. THINGS CALLED MOBILE DEVICES BY  YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF--
John: JESS, JESS, JESS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WHOLE  OLD MAN WITH ME. I'M ONLY IN MY 30s.
EW! THERE'S A 30s. TWITTER LEFT POLITICS AND BUILT  A BRAND WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. HILLARY HAS TO FOLLOW THESE FIVE  BASIC RULES. RULE NUMBER ONE, DON'T TWEET  YOUR JUNK.
John: OKAY, OKAY-- OKAY-- I  DON'T THINK THAT RIL HILLRY  WOULD DO THAT.
IT'S STILL WORTH SAYING. NOBODY THOUGHT A CONGRESSMAN WHO  WAS ALREADY A WALKING DICK JOKE  WOULD BE TWEETINGAISE PICTURE OF HIS JUNK.
John: NO TWEETING JUNK. THAT'S GOOD ADVICE. WHAT'S NEXT?
RULE NUMBER TWO. DON'T BE BORING. HAVE YOU SEEN NEWT GINGRICH'S  TWITTER FEET.
UH, NO.
CHECK IT OUT AND BELIEVE ME,  THESE ARE ALL REAL TWEETS. HE SPENDS HIS TIME TWEETING  ABOUT WELL-BEHAVED DOGS OR  RIDING THE ZOO'S HAIRY ARMADILLO ARE VERY ACTIVE TODAY. ( LAUGHTER )
John: WHO GOES TO ROME AND  VISIT THE ZOO?
WHO GOES TO ROME!
John: GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE.
RULE NUMBER 3-- SERIOUSLY,  THOUGH, DON'T SQUEEZE THE JUNK.
John: YOU ALREADY SAID THAT  ONE.
TRUST ME, IT'S WORTH  REPEATING. RULE NUMBER FOUR. DON'T BE WEIRD, AND I'M LOOK AT  YOU SENATOR GRASSLEY. HE'S TWEET CONFESSING TO KILLING  BAMBI SAYING, "FRED AND I HIT  DEER ON HIGHWAY. ASSUME BEER DEAD."  -- I-- REALLY HOPE THAT BEAR'S  FAMILY DIDN'T HAVE TO FIEND OUT ABOUT HIS DEATH THAT WAY.
YEEL NEVER KNOW. RULE NUMBER 5-- HIGHLIGHT YOUR  SUPER POWERS BUT MAKE SURE TO  SET LIMITS. LOOK AT CORY BOOKER. LIKE WHEN THEY'RE IN THE  SNOWSTORM EVERYBODY COMPLAINED  ABOUT BEING SNOWED INSPECT. YOU KNOW WHAT CORY BOOKER DID? HE SHOWED UP WITH HIS SNOW  SHOVEL.
John: THAT'S PRETTY GOOD  POLITICAL OPTICS FOR HIM.
EXACTLY, BUT REMEMBER PART  TWO OF THE RULE, SET LIMITS. THIS GUY ACTUALLY TWEETED TO  MAJOR BOOKER:
John: WOW! TWITTER IS ROUGH.
OH, NO, DEFINITELY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME PUT IT  IN TERMS HILLARY CLINTON WOULD  UNDERSTAND. HILLARY, GIRL, WITH BEING ON  TWITTER IS LIKE HAVING 100  BENGHAZI HEARINGS EVERY
