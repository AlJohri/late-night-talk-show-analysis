(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT THE CO-CREATORS OF AMERICA'S... THE CO-CREATORS OF VOICE OF  AMERICA'S "PARAZIT", A SATIRICAL NEWS SHOW THAT BROADCASTS IN IRAN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME "PARAZIT" HOSTS KAMBIZ HOSSEINI AND SAMAN ARBABI. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) COME AND SIT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!
Jon: I LIKE THAT YOU GUYS SHOOK HANDS. I LIKE THAT YOU GUYS... OH, WAIT! I WORK WITH YOU.
THIS IS CRAZY.
Jon: GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. I GOT AHOLD OF YOUR SHOW ON THE WEB AND I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THE HEART OF IT, HOW FUNNY IT WAS. HOW DOES YOUR SHOW GET OUT THERE? HOW IS IT SEEN IN IRAN?
YOU WANT TO ANSWER THIS?
WELL... (LAUGHTER)
THERE'S TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THOSE WHO LOVE US AND THOSE WHO REALLY HATE US.
Jon: UH-HUH.
WE CATER TO THE ONES THAT REALLY LOVE US.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND OBVIOUSLY THE ONES THAT HATE US ARE THE REASON WE ACTUALLY DO THE SHOW. (LAUGHTER) BUT TECHNICALLY WE WANT THEM TO LOVE US. TECHNICALLY WE HAVE SATELLITE AND INTERNET AND PEOPLE DOWNLOAD US VIA INTERNET. AND MOSTLY SATELLITE.
Jon: AND IT'S BECOME HUGELY POPULAR IN IRAN DESPITE ALL THE CENSORSHIP AND ALL THE  DIFFICULTIES OVER THERE.
YEAH. IT'S LIKE TRYING TO STOP CAR THEFT. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO I SEE YOU'VE LIVED IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR A WHILE. (LAUGHTER)
25 YEARS, YEAH.
Jon: HOW DID YOU... SO ARE YOU BOTH BORN IN IRAN.
YES.
Jon: OKAY. WHEN DID YOU...
I LEFT IN IRAN IN 1985.
2000.
Jon: I CAN SEE THE PASSION IN WHAT YOU DO AND IT'S VERY ENGAGING. WHEN YOU WATCH THE SHOW, YOU FEEL LIKE THE HEART AND THE ANGER AND THEN THEY CONSTANTLY  CUT AWAY TO, LIKE, FOR THE COMEDY BREAK.
I'M THE FUNNY DUDE.
NO! (LAUGHTER)
IT'S ALL YOU, JON. YOU EAR THE PROPHET. YOU'RE THE PROPHET. YOU ARE THE PROPHET! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE'S THE PROPHET! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) GIVE IT UP FOR JON STEWART, EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND HE'S GOT THE BOOK, TOO!
Jon: SO ARE YOU CALLING ME A PROPHET, THAT WILL IN NO WAY GET IN ME N TROUBLE, WILL IT? (LAUGHTER) THAT'S IN NO WAY A DANGEROUS THING. DO YOU... DO YOU FEEL... WHAT IS THE FEELING THAT YOU HAVEEDLY YOUR COMEDY? IS IT CATHARSIS? DOES IT FEEL LIKE REVENGE? WHAT WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE FOR YOU? BECAUSE YOU TRULY ARE ATTACKING REAL TYRANNY.
ALL OF IT, ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN A COUNTRY THAT OPPRESSED ME ALL MY LIFE. ALL MY LIFE. I WASN'T ABLE TO TALK FREELY. I WASN'T ABLE TO EXPRESS MYSELF FREELY. I HAD TO HAVE HAVE FREEDOM THAT I WANTED TO HAVE INSIDE MY HOME. I WANT AND WHEN I WENT OUT I HAD TO LIE ALL THE TIME. SO THIS KIND OF LIFE-STYLE THAT I HAD AND LOTS OF PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW  INSIDE IRAN CAUSED ALL THIS ANGER, REVENGE, AND EVERYTHING. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO TRANSFER ALL THIS INTO HUMOR AND SAY WHATEVER WE WANT TO SAY WITH THE DARK  ANGRY HUMOR BUT IN A CIVIL WAY.
AHMADINEJAD CAME TO COLUMBIA, ONE OF THE MOST WELL-RESPECTED SCHOOLS OF ALL TIME AND HE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD AND  HE SAID "THERE ARE NO GAYS IN IRAN." THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO HAVE. FROM THEN ON YOU HAVE A SHOW. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S THE SHOW! THAT'S THE SHOW! YOU BRING UP A REALLY INTERESTING POINT, THOUGH, ABOUT DOING IT IN A WAY THAT'S CIVIL  AND APPEALING. YOU HAVE A SEGMENT ON YOUR SHOW CALLED "THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY."  AND YOU KNOW, HERE WE HAVE THE WORST AMERICAN THE WORLD AND PIN HEADS AND PATRIOTS AND  INCREDIBLE HYPERBOLE AND PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING, YOUR BAD CHARACTER OF THE WEEK WAS THE  LEADER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THE UGLY CHARACTER OF THE WEEK WAS AHMADINEJAD. AND I WONDER IN THIS COUNTRY IF WE HAD PEOPLE AT THAT LEVEL OF DECEMBER POETISM AND TYRANNY, I  DON'T KNOW THAT WE'D HAVE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THEM BECAUSE WE'VE  USED THEM ON PEOPLE AND THINGS THAT IN NO WAY MATCH THAT. AND WHAT'S YOUR VIEW OF OUR DISCOURSE IN THAT WAY? HOW IT RELATES TO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY AND THE PROBLEMS IT FACES AND THEN YOU THINK  ABOUT IRAN IN THE WAY YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT THOSE ISSUES.
WELL, SPECIFICALLY TOP IRANIAN POLITICS, HONESTLY WE DON'T CARE SO MUCH.
Jon: (LAUGHS)
WE LIVE IN WASHINGTON.
Jon: I WORKED ON THAT QUESTION FOR 15 (BEEP)ING MINUTES! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SORRY MAN! I'M SORRY.
Jon: LET ME PUT HIT IN THE CONTEXT OF IRANIAN POLITICS. WHAT ALLOWS YOU TO NOT BE HIGH PER BOLL I CAN IN DESCRIBING REAL KIND OF EVIL? BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAT WAY. I THOUGHT WHEN I WATCH YOU GUYS MAN, IT JUST SLICES RIGHT THROUGH IT AND IT MAKES IT SO  MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. YOU KNOW, WHY NOT TITLE IT "THE CRAZIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD"?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THAT IT THESE  REACH PEOPLE CULTURALLY, TOO. WE DESIGNED A SHOW FOR SPECIFIC SPECIFIC PEOPLE IN IRAN AND THEIR YOUTH... MORE THAN 70% OF  IRAN ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 35 AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS SHOW APPEALING TO THEM.
I THINK JON WANTS TO MAKE US LIKE SALMAN RUSHDIE.
Jon: NO! GOD KNOW! THE IDEA IS YOU KNOW HOW AWARE ARE IRANIAN OFFICIALS OF YOU GUYS? ARE THEY AWARE?
VERY MUCH.
OH, YEAH. (LAUGHTER) THEY ACTUALLY WRITE ABOUT US MOST OF THE TIME IN THE STATE PAPERS.
Jon: "TV GUIDE"? (LAUGHTER)
YELLOW PAGES.
Jon: THAT KIND OF THING. ALL RIGHT.
COUPLE OF SHOWS THAT THEY TRY TO... THEY BASICALLY TALK LIKE  US, THEY PRODUCE THE STUFF LIKE US....
Jon: THEY PRODUCE A SATIRE SHOW IN IRAN.
IT'S CALLED ANTI-"PARAZIT." IT'S LIKE HAVING AN ANTI-DAILY SHOW. IMAGINE THAT. HOW FUNNY WOULD THAT BE? IT'S LIKE "THE DAILY SHOW" AND THERE'S THIS OTHER CHANNEL  THAT'S... AIRS THAT ANTI-"THE DAILY SHOW."
Jon: AND THEN YOU GO INTO LIKE A WORM HOLE AND THEY JUST THINK OKAY, WE'RE EVEN NOW. (LAUGHTER)
BASICALLY.
Jon: HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IT?
WE STARTED IN MAY OF 2008 AND THAT WAS TEN-MINUTE SEGMENT AND THEN THE ELECTIONS HAPPENED, OBVIOUSLY, AND THINGS GOT REALLY CRAZY AND WE LAUNCHED OFFICIALLY AS A 30-MINUTE WEEKLY SHOW IN  MARCH OF 2009.
AND WE WATCH A LOT OF "THE DAILY SHOW."
Jon: (LAUGHS) I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL AND THEN WE'RE GOING ON THE WEB  BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE. I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU'RE LIKE OUR SHOW BUT WITH REAL GUTS AND  I'M PROUD TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE FRATERNITY OF HUMORISTS THAT YOU GUYS ARE IN. AND I'M HONORED TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND HUMBLED BY YOU. KAMBIZ HOSSEINI AND SAMAN ARBABI AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS. (CHEERS AND
