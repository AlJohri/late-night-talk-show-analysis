FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. DENIS LEARY WILL BE ON THE  PROGRAM, AUTHOR OF THE NEW YORK,  MERRY [BLEEP] CHRISTMAS. AM I READING THAT TITLE  CORRECTLY? Iï¿½i CAN ONLY ASSUME IT'S A  DELIGHTFUL ROMP TO HOLIDAY  COOKING AND DECORATING. LEARY LOVES CRAFTING. SPEAKING OF CHRISTMAS, YOU  PROBABLY ARE AWARE BY NOW OUR  NATION HAS BEEN EMBROILED IN A LONG, BITTER WAR.
THE FIRST SALVO IN THE WAR ON  CHRISTMAS
THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS  Jon: WAR ON CHRISTMAS! NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH GWAR ON  CHRISTMAS. TREMENDOUS CHRISTMAS ALBUM. FOR YEARS NOW CHRISTMAS HAS BEEN  UNDER ATTACK DEFENDED BY THE  BRAVE SOULS AT FOX NEWS. ARE THEY STILL UP TO THE TASK? THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S  "WAR ON CHRISTMAS, FRIENDLY  FIRE" EDITION. LET'S FACE FACTS. THE ANNUAL FOX WAR ON CHRISTMAS  HAS BECOME A LITTLE PREDICTABLE. BASICALLY IMAGINE YOU CAN MAKE  ONE UP LIKE A MAKE FOX NEWS MAD  LIBS. LET'S SEE. SO LET'S SEE. LET'S TRY TO DO ONE OF THESE. LAST WEEK IN... I NEED THE NAME  OF SOME GODLESS LIBERAL BASTION
SANTA MONICA. Jon: THAT WILL DO. I MEAN FILL IN SANTA MONICA  THERE AND IN SANTA MONICA A  GROUP OF... GIVE ME THE NAME OF A SMALL GROUP OF ANNOYING PEOPLE  WITH INCREDIBLY LIMITED CONTROL  OVER OUR CULTURE
ATHEISTS  Jon: ATHEISTS WILL DO. THAT'S RIGHT. EVERYONE'S FAVORITE UNCLE THAT  LIVES IN OREGON THAT NO ONE EVER  SEES. A GROUP OF ATHEISTS HAVE RUINED  CHRISTMAS BY FORCING THE REMOVAL  OF... I NEED A CLASSIC CHRISTMAS  SYMBOL. (LAUGHING)  DAM IT, BRIAN, WE'RE TRYING TO  DO SOMETHING HERE. GO SIT IN THE CAR.
A NATIVITY SCENE  Jon: THANK YOU, NATIVITY  SCENE. SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL GROWN-UPS  OVER THERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE DONE. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PUT THAT  ALTOGETHER, SHALL WE
ATHEE I HAVES SEEMED TO HAVE  ENDED A 60-YEAR-OLD CHRISTMAS  TRADITION IN SANTA MONICA CALIFORNIA
A FEDERAL JUDGE BACKING SAPT  A MONICA'S DECISION TO NO LONGER  ALLOW NATIVITY SCENES AT A PUBLIC PARK
Jon: OH, MY GOD, THAT IS SUCH  AN OUT... (SNORING). CHRISTMAS HAS BECOME A ROTE  OBSERVANCE. DEVOID OF ALL ITS ORIGINAL  SPIRITUAL MEANING. EVEN IF IT'S MOST ARDENT  OPPONENTS HAVE SEEN DOUBT CREEP?
A LOT OF PEOPLE, FOR WHATEVER  REASON, WILL LOOK AT THIS  INTERVIEW TODAY AND THEY'LL SAY, GRETCHEN CARLSON AND DOREEN  COSTA ARE NUTS. OKAY. THEY'RE SO NUTS BECAUSE THEY  THINK THAT THERE'S THIS MADE-UP  WAR ON CHRISTMAS. WE'RE NOT NEWS. ARE WE? THERE IS A WAR ON CHRISTMAS. WE'RE NOT NUTS, ARE WE? THERE IS A WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
Jon: AS A GENERAL RULE, IF  YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL WHETHER  YOU AND ONE OTHER PERSON ARE NUTS, ASK A THIRD PERSON. PREFERABLY SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE  ASYLUM. BUT SINCE YOU ASKED THE  QUESTION, AM I NUTS TO THINK  THERE'S A WAR ON CHRISTMAS IT'S ONLY RIGHT FOR ME TO OFFER YOU A  RESOUNDING [BLEEP] BECAUSE FOR  WHATEVER ANNOYING LOCAL CHRISTMAS-ABOLISHING STORY YOU  AND YOUR MERRY BAND OF  RESEARCHERS CAN SCOUR THE WIRES TO TURN UP, THE REST OF US CAN'T  SWING A DEAD ELF WITHOUT  KNOCKING OVER A GIANT CANDY  CANE. FOR GOD'S SAKE FOX NEWS ITSELF  IS IS LOCATED IN MIDTOWN  MANHATTAN THE EPICENTER OF ALL THAT IS GODLESS, SECULAR, GAY,  JEWY AND HELL BOUND. YET EVEN HERE ALL AROUND YOUR  STUDIO IT LOOKS LIKE SANTA'S  BALLS EXPLODED. THAT IS A HYPOTHESIS. YOU KNOW, IN THE OLD DAYS BEFORE  THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS, THE  CELEBRATION AND THE BIRTH OF CHRIST LASTED A DAY. LIKE BIRTHDAYS DO. THEN IT SEEPED INTO THE NIGHT  BEFORE CHRISTMAS. THE EVE, IF YOU WILL. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WE WERE  RIDING THIS THING ALL THE WAY TO  EPIPHANY. FINE 12 DAYS GAVE TIME FOR LORDS  TO LEAP AND PARTRIDGES TO PAIR  AND GOLD TO RING AND JUST 12 DAYS OF SERVANTS AND [BLEEP] POURLTRY, WHATEVER. BUT IT STILL WASN'T ENOUGH. THERE'S A WAR ON CHRISTMAS? HAS ANYONE TOLD THANKSGIVING? BECAUSE THIS YEAR BLACK FRIDAY,  A.K.A. CHRISTMAS' OPENING BELL  GOT MOVED BACK A DAY TO BLACK THURSDAY OR AS WE USED TO CALL  IT THANKSGIVING. CHRISTMAS IS SO BIG NOW, IT'S  EATING OTHER HOLIDAYS. WATCH YOUR ASS, HALLOWEEN,  YOU'RE NEXT.   ( APPLAUSE )   I MEAN LET ME ASK YOU A  QUESTION. DO ATHEE I HAVES LAND AN  OCCASIONAL BLOW? I GUESS. EVEN THE WASHINGTON GENERALS GET  LUCKY ONCE IN A WHILE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL  RECORD BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS,  FOR GOD'S SAKES THERE ARE RADIO STATIONS THAT PLAY NOTHING BUT  CHRISTMAS CAROLS, STORES THAT  SELL NOTHING BUT CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS ALL YEARLONG. THERE IS A TV CHANNEL DEVOTED TO  A YULE LOG. AND IT'S KICKING CNN'S ASS IN  THE RATINGS. DON'T WORRY, NON- LOG-BURNING  CHANNEL, THERE'S CHRISTMAS  PROGRAMS FOR YOU AS WELL. THERE'S TINY TRADITIONAL  CHRISTMAS PROGRAMMING, REALLY  OLD-TIMEY. SPECIAL CHRISTMAS PROGRAMMING. URBAN CHRISTMAS SPECIALS. MORMON CHRISTMAS SPECIALS. COUNTRY WESTERN CHRISTMAS  SPECIALS. CHIPMUNKS' CHRISTMAS SPECIALS. OTTER CHRISTMAS SPECIALS. BEAR CHRISTMAS SPECIALS. CAT CHRISTMAS SPECIALS. LARGE-HEADED CHILD CHRISTMAS. GAY CHRISTMAS. JEWISH CHRISTMAS. WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THIS IS  CHRISTMAS. CHRISTMAS UNDERWATER. CHRISTMAS FROM THE FUTURE. PREHISTORIC CHRISTMAS. THAT'S RIGHT. THERE'S A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL  CELEBRATING JESUS' BIRTH  THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE BIRTH OF JESUS.   ( APPLAUSE )   THAT IS A HOLIDAY THAT IS NOT IN  DANGER. THERE IS SO MUCH CHRISTMAS ALL  OVER THE PLACE IT'S GETTING  HARDER FOR CHRISTMAS' DEFENDERS TO FIGHT FOR CHRISTMAS WITHOUT  ACCIDENTALLY DOING DAMAGE TO IT  WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR FRIENDLY FIRE ENGINE. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR GOOD  FRIEND BILL O'REILLY TAKES THE  ATHEISTS' BAIT
WHAT RELIGION IS INVOLVED  WITH CHRISTMAS
WHAT RELIGION  CHRISTIANITY  THAT'S NOT A RELIGION. THAT'S A PLOS FEAR
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME ON  LIVE TELEVISION THAT  CHRISTIANITY IS NOT A RELIGION?
CORRECT. IT IS A PLOS FEE. ... PHILOSOPHY.
Jon: NOOOOO! BILL, WHY? BILL, WHY? HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING FROM  OUR FRIENDSHIP? YOU JUST HANDED THAT ATHEIST  ANOTHER THING HE CAN'T [BLEEP] BELIEVE. CHRISTIANITY IS A RELIGION. CHRISTIANITY HAS A PHILOSOPHICAL  ELEMENT BUT THERE IS A  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PHILOSOPHY AND A RELIGION. FOR INSTANCE, LET'S LOOK AT  THIS. A LOT IN COMMON. LOOSE FITTING CLOTHING, BEARDS,  SANDALS, TEACHING THROUGH  PARABLES, MARTYRDOM. BUT HERE'S WHERE WE FIND THE  DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY  AND RELIGION. AFTER THEIR MARTYRDOM, ONE OF  THEM GOT BETTER. I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. IT'S THE ONE WHO ASCENDED INTO  HEAVEN AND IS SEATED AT THE  RIGHT HAND OF THE FATHER WHO WILL COME AGAIN TO JUDGE THE  LIVING AND THE DEAD. WHOSE KINGDOM WILL HAVE NO END. ANYONE? IT'S JESUS! WE BESTOW ONE OF THEM TAX-EXEMPT  STATUS. WHY ISN'T CHRISTIANITY A  RELIGION?
CHRISTIANITY IS NOT AN  ORGANIZED RELIGION. A CHURCH THAT CAN BE IMPOSED. CHRISTIANITY IS A PHILOSOPHY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE JESUS  IS GOD IN ORDER TO ADMIRE HIS  VIEW ON LIFE.
Jon: NO. BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE JESUS IS  GOD TO BE A CRISTIAN. FOR INSTANCE, I LIKE A LOT OF  JESUS' PHILOSOPHY. LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR. A LITTLE CHEEK TURNING. STONE NOT CASTING. IT'S VERY NICE. BUT WHILE I CAN GET AN "A" IN  HIS PHILOSOPHY CLASS, I DON'T  GET TO GO TO THE AFTER PARTY. YOU GET WHAT I'M SAYING HERE? SO YOU WANT TO DO THIS AT MY  PLACE OR YOUR PLACE BECAUSE [BLEEP] WE'LL BE RIGHT
