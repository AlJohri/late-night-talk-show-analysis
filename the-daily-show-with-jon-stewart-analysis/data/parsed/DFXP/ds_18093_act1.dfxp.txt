FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE  IS JON STEWART.MY NAME  WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. FROM "MAD MEN" JON HAMM WILL BE  JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM. HE'S KOSHER FOR PAPS OVER, THAT  MAN. LET ME SAY THIS-- LET'S BEGIN  TONIGHT WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS. WE ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK UP  "CONGRESS" IN THE DICTIONARY, IT  SAYS, "DO NOT ( BLEEP ) TARREDS WHO COULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM  IF IT WAS EATING THEM ALIVE ANUS  FIRST  ♪ ♪  ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  HOLD ON. I SHOULD MENTION I ONLY USE  URBAN DICTIONARIES. BUT IT IS WHY THE DETRIMENTAL  EFFECTS OF THE SEQUESTER, THE  PAINFUL ACROSS-THE-BOARD BUDGET CUTS THAT ARE WREAKING HAVOC ON  FEDERAL SERVICES, SEEM LIKE  THEY'RE HERE TO STAY. EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS  ARE RUNNING OUT IN WESTERN  MASSACHUSETTS. HEAD START PROGRAMS ARE CLOSING  EARLY IN RHODE ISLAND. JOBLESS CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE  FORGOING $1.2 BILLION EACH WEEK. SENIORS IN MAINE ARE GOING  WITHOUT MEALS ON WHEELS, WHICH,  BY THE WAY, SEEMS LIKE A COOL PROGRAM TO BEGIN WITH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  HE'S HUNGRY! HE'S SO-- THERE GOES MY-- MY  PIE. ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S YET NEWS FROM CONGRESS  LAST WEEK WAS SO SURPRISING AND  SO WELCOME.
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS  CAME TOGETHER LATE LAST NIGHT.
IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE IMPACT  OF THE SEQUESTER.
Jon:  PRAISE IT BE OUR  ESTEEMED LEADER! WHAT BOLD LEGISLATIVE ACTION  HAVE THEY UNDERTAKEN TO EASE  AMERICA'S BURDEN?
BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS MOVED  QUICKLY TO GIVE THE FEDERAL  AVIATION ADMINISTRATION MORE FLEXIBILITY IN CUTTING THEIR  BUDGET, ALLOWING THEM TO BRING  BACK AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER STAFFING TO 100%.
Jon:  OH, THAT'S VERY  INTERESTING. ( LAUGHTER )  CERTAINLY, VERY HELPFUL. WHY, PER CHANCE, THAT PART OF  THE SEQUESTER?
A FEW HOURS AFTER VOTING,  MEMBERS LEFT CAPITOL HILL AND  HEADED TO THE AIRPORT FOR A WEEK-LONG RECESS.
Jon:  OH, RIGHT! ( APPLAUSE )  OH, RIGHT! BECAUSE--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT'S THE PROBLEM FROM THE  SEQUESTER THAT AFFECTS THEM. ( LAUGHTER )  THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT MEALS ON  WHEELS UNLESS IT'S ROLLING DOWN  AN AISLE. HERE'S THE BEST PART-- HOW FAST  THEY CAN GET SOMETHING DONE ARE  WHEN IT AFFECTS THEM.
THEY PASSED THE BILL THAT WAS  CRAFTED SO QUICKLY, PARTS OF IT  WERE HANDWRITTEN. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  LEAKS, I TAKE YOU  TO LEGISLATION THEATER. ( LAUGHTER )  OPEN ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. WHAT TIME DOES YOUR PLANE TAKE  OFF? "8:00."  I TONIGHT KNOW WHY THEY HAVE THE  SAME VOICE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. HOLD ON. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  DOESN'T MATTER. "8:00? YOU BETTER LEAVE NOW. THE LINES ARE VERY LONG."  "WHY?"  "YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE  INDISCRIMINATELY CUT FEDERAL FUNDING ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE  WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD FORCE US  TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO OUR BUDGET IMPASSE."  "OH, YEAH, YEAH."  WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY LONG LINES  AT THE AIRPORT?" "YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG  TIME."  "( BLEEP ), GIVE ME A PEN."  DONE! "NOW LET'S GO HOME."  THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT. ( APPLAUSE )  THE PLAY SOMEWHAT FELL APART IN  THE SECOND ACT. ( LAUGHTER )  BY THE WAY, I'M NOT SURE WHY  HANDWRITING THE BILL GETS IT  DONE FASTER. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, IF YOU GIVE  CONGRESS COMPUTERS DO THEY JUST  SPEND ALL THEIR TIME ON PORN SITES PROCRASTURBATING, USING  MASTURBATION TO OCTER WISE  OCCUPY YOURSELF. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE FILLED WITH  PROCRASTURBATERS. I GUESS WE'RE LUCKY THEY'RE  HERE. ( LAUGHTER )  WELL, HOPEFULLY CONGRESS IS AT  LEAST SLIGHTLY EMBARRASSED BY  THIS EXERCISE IN SELF-INTEREST.
I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE SENATE  HAS JUST PASSED A BIPARTISAN  BILL TO RESOLVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM CONFRONTING THE AMERICAN  TRAVELING PUBLIC AND OUR  ECONOMY, AND IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER WE  REALLY CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS.
Jon:  YEAH, HOW NICE FOR  YOU. ( LAUGHTER )  I THINK I HAVE A NEW WORD FOR  THE URBAN DICTIONARY-- CONGRATS  BAITING. CREATING A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, AND PRAISING  ONES FOR FIXING THE SMALL PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS YOU,  AND THEN MASTURBATING. THE BEST PART OF THIS STORY, THE  HEARING CONGRESS HELD DEMANDING  ANSWERS ABOUT�r AIRLINE DELAYS FROM F.A.A. DIRECTOR MICHAEL  HUERTA.
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS  FOR YOU THIS MORNING. THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE HOW  COME YOU DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT  THIS BEFOREHAND, THE SEQUESTER IMPACT ON THE LAYOFFS,  FURLOUGHS? NOT A WORD. NOT A BREATH. YOU DIDN'T FORWARN US THAT THIS  WAS COMING.
Jon:  WE WON'T EVER GET  OLD AND WE WON'T EVER DIE. ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S CONGRESSMAN HAL ROGERS  THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE  APPROPRIATIONS WILL COMMITTEE, THE COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES ALL  FEDERAL EXPENDITURES, ASKING WHY  THEY WERE NEVER TOLD�� THAT THE SEQUESTER, THE CUTTING OF SAID  EXPENDITURES, WOULD IMPACT AIR  TRAVEL. AND HE'S GOT A POINT. WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT? ROLE MONTAGE OF EVERYONE  MENTIONING THAT.
NO SEQUESTER DEAL IN SIGHT. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS AIR TRAVEL  GUILTY HAYWIRE.
FEDERAL SPENDING CUTS  THREATEN DELAYS IN AIR TRAVEL.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE LINES AT  THE AIRPORTS. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FURLOUGHS.
FEWER FLIGHTS AND DELAYS OF  UP TO 90 MINUTES OR MORE.
SOME FLIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE  CANCELED. TOWERS SHUT DOWN FOR PERIOD OF  TIMES TO DEAL WITH THESE BUDGET  CUTS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WHAT DO THEY MEAN  BY THAT? ( LAUGHTER )  OKAY, FINE. BUT WE NEVER HEARD THAT FROM... THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. ROLL FOOTAGE OF THE SECRETARY OF  TRORS.
WELL, LOOK, WHEN IT COMES TO  TRANSPORTATION, WE HAVE TO CUT  $1 BILLION, $600 MILLION FROM F.A.A., AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE  ANNOUNCED THERE'S GOING TO BE A  SLOWDOWN AND DELAYS IN FLIGHTS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FURLOUGH  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  ADDING HOW LOUD DO  I HAVE TO ( BLEEP ) SAY IT? ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  LOOK, YOU KNOW,.   ( CHEERS )   -- WHAT-- THIS IS KIND OF FUN. WATCH CONGRESSMAN ROGERS  CONFRONT WITH THE FACT THAT HE  WAS FORWARNED. WATCH HIM ASIMULATE THIS NEW  INFORMATION AND STILL FIND A WAY  TOUE IT AGAINST HIS OPPONENT USING SOME KIND OF DICK-JITSUE  MOVE.
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT  REDUCTION IN AVAILABLE  CONTROLLER HOURS OF 10% FOR  MONTHS.
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM  WHICH AIRPORTS, WHICH AIRLINES.
WE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD  EXPECT SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS AT  MAJOR HUB FACILITIES.
WELL, LA-TI-DA. EVERYONE KNEW THAT.
Jon:  "LA-TI-DA."  "I MEAN, I MEAN, MAJOR AIRPORT  HUB COULD BE-- COULD BE  ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW."  ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  "I MEAN, ( BLEEP ) ME TWICE WITH  A BULLFROG." ( APPLAUSE )  THAT GUY THERE, THAT GUY THERE,  THAT'S THE REASON PEANUT BUTTER  JARS HAVE TO SAY, "MANUFACTURED IN A FACILITY THAT�i MAY PROCESS  PEANUTS."  ( LAUGHTER )  MEANWHILE, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE SEQUESTER WAS ALSO AFFECTING  NON-CONGRESSIONAL PEOPLE'S  LIVES? YEAH.
FLIGHT DELAYS ASIDE, PUNDITS  HAVE IT MADE IT CLEAR THE  SEQUESTER HAS BEEN A WHOLE LOT OF NOCT.
THE SEQUESTER TURNED OUT TIE  A NO-QUESTER.
IT'S WAY OVERBLOWN.
NOTHING REALLY BAD HAS  HAPPENED.
BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS GOTTEN  THE MEMO.
THERE WILL BE NO HAPPY  ENDING.
MR. FROWNY PANTS JOEL BERG OF  THE NEW YORK CITY COALITION  AGAINST HUNGER.
THE WHOLE REASON THE  SEQUESTRATION HASN'T GOTTEN MORE  MEDIA COVERAGE IS BECAUSE IT'S AFFECTING POOR PEOPLE MOST.
SO NOBODY'S REALLY BEEN  AFFECTED.
TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS  HAVE ALREADY BEEN AFFECTED. IT'S A SHAME ON THE NATION.
SO�r IT'S�i ALL OVERBLOWN THEN.
ALREADY, THERE'S BYE-BYE A  $5.1 MILLION CUT NATIONWIDE IN  SOUP AND MONEY GOING TO SOUP  KITCHENS.
SOUP CCHES, COME OEVERYBODY  KNOWS --
THE SEQUESTER SAY JOKE.
IT'S SO FUNNY, EVEN THE SOUP  KITCHENS ARE LAWFLG.
WE SERVE 1,000 PEOPLE A DAY  OR MORE, CUT ALMOST $200,000  EVERY YEAR FOR THE NEXT FOUR  YEARS. WE'VE HAD TO CUT BACK ON SOME  THINGS WE SERVE. ( LAUGHTER )  FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT'S THE ONLY  FOOD THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE  FOR 24 HOURS. ( LAUGHTER )
I GUESS ANOTHER WAY TO SAY  THAT IS-- >>IS.-
NO SOUP FOR YOU!
THIS IS A MANUFACTURING  CRISIS THAT-- THAT THE PRESIDENT  IS TRYING TO MAKE OUT.
JUST ASK DR. VERSAKA, OF  NORTH SHORE HEMATOLOGY, ONCOLOGY  ASSOCIATES.
THE SEQUESTER CUTS HAVE MADE  IT TOO COSTLY FOR US TO TREAT UP  TO 5,000 PATIENTS HERE IN THE  CLINIC.
SEE, THAT THAT'S FUNNY.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE BIG  PICTURE IS THIS WILL ACTUALLY  COST THE TAXPAYER AROUND $1.6 BILLION BY SHIFTING CARE.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE CURING  CANCER, RIGHT?
AS A MATTER OF FACT WE ARE.
RIGHT, SO THAT'S BAD THEN.
JUST WHEN THE SEQUESTER WAS  ABOUT TO GET ME DOWN, I FOUND AN  ACTUAL SUCCESS STORY IN THE SOUTHERN OHIO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S  OFFICE.
WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD TO FIRE  ANY EMPLOYEES.
THAT'S TERRIFIC. THAT'S A SUCCESS STORY.
JUST SELECTED MYSELF FOR  TERMINATION.
WHAT?
I FIRED MYSELF.
THAT'S STUPID!
IT'S THE ONLY OPTION I HAD  BECAUSE OF SEQUESTRATION.
AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH  THE FACT THAT THE GUY YOU FIRED  WAS ( BLEEP ) YOUR WIFE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  HE GETS IT. TO CELEBRATE, WE WENT TO REF��  REVEREND CHAWMER'S SOUP KITCHEN,  THE ONE PLACE STEVE COULD NOW AFFORD TO EAT, THANKS TO THE  SEQUE
