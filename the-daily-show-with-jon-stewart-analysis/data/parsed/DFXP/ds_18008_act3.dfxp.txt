JNCH WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A DIRECTOR AND  SCREEN WRITER PHONE FOR BOOGIE  NIGHTS, MAGNOLIA AND THERE WILL  BE BLOOD. HIS LATEST IS "THE MASTER. ".
THESE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE.
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD YOU  BUT IF YOU HAVE WORK FOR ME TO  DO, CAN I DO IT.
YOU SEEM SO FAMILIAR TO ME.
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU DO?
I DO MANY, MANY THINGS. I AM A WRITER, A DOCTOR, A  NUCLEAR PHYSICIST, A THEORETICAL  PHILOSOPHER BUT ABOVE ALL I AM A  MAN HOPELESSLY INQUISITIVE MAN JUST LIKE YOU.
Jon: I WILL FOLLOW YOU. PLEASE WELCOME PAUL THOMAS  ANDERSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO  START. I'M AN ENORMOUS FAN OF YOURS. I'M GOING TO START ON THE  PERFORMANCE END OF IT FOR THE  ACTORS. FORGET ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL  WRITING, THE SHOOTING, ALL THE  THINGS YOU DO. THE PERFORMANCES YOU GET FROM  THE ACTORS THAT YOU HAVE. OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GREAT ACTORS,  HOW DO YOU -- AS A DIRECTOR HOW  DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE ABLE TO  EMPOWER THE ACTORS TO GET THE KIND OF PERFORMANCES YOU GET?
UM, --
Jon: I'LL LEAVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I HIRE GOOD ONES.
Jon: THAT HELPS.
THAT HELPS AND I TRY TO DO AS  MUCH AS I CAN IN THE WRITING AND  THEN TRY TO LISTEN TO THEM AND SEE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THINGS  GIVE THEM ROOM TO DO IT.
Jon: IN A SCENE AFTER A  TAKE WILL YOU -- CUT, WALK OUT  AND BE LIKE -- YOU KNOW THAT  KIND OF THING? IS THERE ON SET DO YOU GET  MANIACAL. WHAT IS YOUR TEMPERAMENT?
PRETTY -- I DON'T KNOW --
Jon: YOU SEEM ANGRY, YOU  SEEM LIKE AN ANGRY GUY.
I TRY TO PLAY IT PRETTY COOL. WHEN YOU ARE A WRITER YOU CAN  GET MAD AT YOURSELF IN A ROOM  AND BANG YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE  WALL. WHEN YOU ARE A DIRECTOR YOU YOU  HAVE TO PRETEND YOU DIDN'T DO  THAT STUFF AND BE COOL AND BE   EVERYBODY'S BOSS. SO --
Joe: DO YOU COMPLETE THE  WRITING PROCESS IN YOUR MIND AND  THEN BECOME THE DIRECTOR OR AS  YOU ARE WRITING ARE YOU -- YOU KNOW, I FIND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT  TO -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  WRITING FOR THE PAGE AND WRITING  FOR THE PERFORMANCE IS A DIFFERENT ART FORM. DO YOU DO THAT AS YOU ARE  WRITING OR TRANSITION THAT?
WHEN I WRITE, WHEN IT'S AT  ITS BEST WHRVEG IT'S GOING  REALLY WELL YOU BLINK YOUR EYES  AND TEN PRETTY GOOD PAGES HAVE  HAPPENED. AT ITS WORST YOU ARE DESPERATE  TO TRY TO GET IT GOING WELL. WHEN YOU GET TO THE SET, I JUST  SORT OF THROW THE SCRIPT OUT THE  WINDOW AND HOPEFULLY THEY  REMEMBER IT AND THEY KNOW IT AND THEY'VE DONE IT WELL.
Jon: YOU THROW IT OUT THE  WINDOW? DO YOU EVER TELL YOURSELF THE  WRITER, HEY, MAN, DON'T SWEAT  THIS I'M GOING TO (bleep)  DITCH IT? [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I IMAGINE MYSELF WITH  WRITING THERE ARE TIMES WHERE  I -- IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO BE  PRECIOUS WITH THE WORD -- PRESCIENT WITH THE WORDS. TO REMEMBER TO CONVINCE YOURSELF  JUST PUT IT ON PAPER. SO MUCH WRITING IS REWRITING AND  YOU CAN HOLD YOURSELF BACK FROM  PUTTING IT OUT THERE.
I THINK THAT'S TRUE. I'VE WRITTEN 50 DRAFTS OF  THINGS. AND THANK GOD FOR SAVING  EVERYTHING YOU WRITE. YOU SORT OF LOOK BACK AT THE  FIRST THING AND REALIZE YOU HAD  IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE  IT VOMITED OUT OF YOU OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE OTHER THING I HAVE FOUND IS,  YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY  SOMETIMES YOU CAN WRITE  SOMETHING 50 TIMES AND YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER. IT CREATES THIS ENDLESS SORT OF  REACH FOR SOMETHING THAT KEEPS  YOU HUNGRY AND ALWAYS GUESSING  LIKE HOW DOES THIS STUFF WORK? HOW DOES WRITING SPHWHORK IT'S  SO CONFUSING.
Jon: RIGHT. WHAT MAKES YOU STOP. WHAT MAKES ME STOP HERE IS IT'S  6:00. WE'LL RIGHT TO THE POINT WHERE  WE'RE LIKE, MAY, MAN, THERE'S AN  AUDIENCE OUT THERE AND THEY LOOK  MAD. THEY'VE BEEN SITTING THERE FOR  FIVE HOURS BETTER DO A SHOW. BUT AS A WRITER OF FILM, HOW DO  YOU STOP, HOW DO YOU NOT  OVERWRITE? , DETROIT THE ON THE BACK END?
IT'S KIND OF SAME THING. THE CLOCK IS NOT TICKING THAT  BADLY BUT BASICALLY IT'S LIKE  WE'RE GOING TO GET TOGETHER IN  MARCH SO -- AND LET'S SAY THAT IS SIX MONTHS AWAY. YOU KIND OF, AS A WRITER YOU  HAVE TO GO SIX MONTHS AND THE  CLOCK IS TICKING AND YOU HAVE TO  GET IT TOGETHER. YOU HAVE TO PLAN THAT FAR AHEAD  IN ADVANCE.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT IT'S LIKE A SLOW TICKING  BOMB. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET'S TALK CATERING --  WE HAVE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM HERE. ONCE IT'S DONE, THEN YOU HAVE  ALL THE POST PRODUCTION AND ALL  THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU HAVE  TO DO. DOES THE SPELLING OF IT FEEL  LIKE YOU ARE MAKING SOMETHING  YOU DID A LONG TIME AGO? DOES IT FEEL VITAL IN YOUR MIND? HOW IS IT IF THAT PROCESS.
OH, GOD D -- GOD. I WAS WATCHING THAT CLIP AND I  DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE  GOING TO SAY.
Jon: I COMPLETELY  UNDERSTAND THAT.
THAT'S A NICE PLACE TO GET  TO, ACTUALLY WHERE YOU HAVE  ENOUGH DISTANCE FROM IT. YEAH, THERE'S A LOT THAT I DON'T  BREB THIS FILM ALREADY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I WOULD LOVE FOR M. NIGHT TOLL BE ONE OF HIS OWN  MOVIES AND SAY THAT GUY WAS DEAD  THE WHOLE TIME? I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT I BLIEK WHAT YOU DO --  EVERYTHING IS SO -- YOU FEEL THE  ART OF IT. IT'S SO VIVID. IT'S EVERY CHOICE YOU MAKE. IS THAT PRECONCEIVED? DO YOU YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF EACH  MOMENT AND HOW YOU WANT TO  CREATE IT?
NO. INHE HAVE HAVE ITIBLY YOU ARE  DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE USUALLY THE  THINGS YOU SEE IN YOUR HEAD WHEN  YOU STAND IN A PLACE WITH THREE DIMENSIONS THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THE LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE  WINDOW IN A DIFFERENT WAY OR  SOMEWHERE IS WEARING SOMETHING  DIFFERENT SO -- YOU TRY TO BE AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE TO SITUATIONS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I CAN'T  JUST BE THE ENDLESS SEARCH. THERE'S A LOT OF PLANNING YOU  HAVE TO DO. HOPEFULLY YOU KIND OF -- YOU CAN  CREATE SITUATION WHERE ACCIDENTS  CAN'T HAPPEN AND THINGS CAN GO  WRONG.
Jon: THE ENVIRONMENT. ASPIRATION BUT REALISTIC.
THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THE MASTER. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF FILM  MAKING. IT'S IN THEATERS NOW. THE GREAT PAUL THOMAS
