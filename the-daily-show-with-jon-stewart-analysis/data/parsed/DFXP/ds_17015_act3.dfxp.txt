( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AWARD-WINNING JOURNALIST, BESTSELLING AWGHTO AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED, "THE TIME OF OUR LIVES. A CONVERSATION WITH AMERICA." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, TOM BROKAW. ( APPLAUSE ) PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon:  THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE TIME OF OUR LIVES, A CONVERSATION ABOUT AMERICA."  I ASSUME IF I OPEN IT UP, IT WILL JUST START SHOUTING AT ME.
NO, WHAT IT WILL DO IS SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS AT ONCE. I MEAN, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO-- YOU JUST READ THIS BOOK AND AMERICA GETS BACK TO WHERE IT  WANTED TO BE. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.
Jon:  YOU WRITE IN THERE THAT THIS IS THE WORST ANYBODY HAS EVER SEEN IT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN WASHINGTON SINCE WATERGATE, THE INTERNET, AND BLOGS HAVE  HARDENED PEOPLE'S OPINIONS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO DEFEND THEIR OWN  IDEOLOGICAL TURF.
THERE'S MORE POLARIZATION THAN ANY TIME I HAVE SEEN IT. I CHECKED WITH FRIENDS IN WASHINGTON AND MANY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT OUR INSTITUTION. I HAD TWO BRIGHT MEN COME UP INTO ME IN WASHINGTON AND SAID,"  MR. BROKE AUGUST, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE OLD DAYS." I THINK THEY MEANT 1998. HE SAID, "I'M A DEMOCRAT. HE'S A REPUBLICAN. HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. WE ARGUE POLITICS ALL NIGHT LONG. THEY BOTH WORK FOR CONGRESSMEN. HE SAID MY BOSS WON'T TALK TO HIS BOSS, AND HIS BOSS WON'T TALK TO MY BOSS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WOULD GENERALLY FIND A WAY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WAS IN  THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY, EVEN IN THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME, JON.
Jon:  WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE COUNTRY, DO YOU GET A SENSE  THAT PEOPLE ARE AS POLARIZED OR THAT WASHINGTON HAS BECOME LIKE THE RESIN OF DISAGREEMENT. THEY'VE JUST BECOME THIS PURE FORM OF POLARIZATION THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXIST?
NO, WHAT I FIND WHEN I GO OUT IN THE COUNTRY THEY FEEL WASHINGTON IS WALLED OFF FROM THEM. SO IF YOU GO TO A MID-SIZED CITY IN MID-AMERICA, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU FIND A REPUBLICAN BANKER WORKING  WITH THE DEMOCRAT WHO IS A BACKHOE OPERATOR OR CONTRACTOR OF SOME KIND BECAUSE THEY HAVE  TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES AND THEY HAVE TO PRESERVE THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR BUSINESS AND  THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY'VE PRETTY MUCH GIVEN UP ON THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE GOING TO  GET MUCH HELP FROM WASHINGTON. 77% OF THE COUNTRY IN ALMOST ALL THE POLLS SAY WE WANT THESE PARTIES TO WORK TOGETHER AGAIN. BUT AS YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO FAR CORNERS OF THE ROOM AND THEY DON'T WANT TO  COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER.
Jon:  YOU MADE AN INTERESTING POINT IN THE BOOK. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CONNECTION AMERICANS HAVE WITH THE COUNTRY, THIS IDEA OF SERVICE. YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY SEEM MORE CHARITY-MINDED THAN THEY WERE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. BUT I WAS HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW. ( LAUGHTER ). I-- I-- I COULD HAVE-- I COULD HAVE MISSED A LOT OF-- A LOT OF EVENTS THAT WERE MORE SUPPORT BASED.
I'VE BEEN TO YOUR ALMA MATER, AND I'VE GOT THE RECORDS, JON. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
Jon:  NO, I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.
I'M HANGING ON TO THEM.
Jon:  I UNDERSTAND THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
Jon:  YOU GET THE SENSE THERE IS SORT OF THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE VERY MUCH LOOKING FOR A  DIRECTION TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN BUT ARE FINDING THEIR OWN WAY. THERE ISN'T ANY KIND OF TOP. DOWN LEADERSHIP.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY DON'T WE HAVE MANDATORY PUBLIC SERVICE? WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT AGAIN. WHAT I SUGGEST IN THE BOOK IS WE COULD HAVE PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMIES, KIND OF ON THE MODEL  OF THE MILITARY ACADEMIES, PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, THE JOHN DERERKS FELLOW IN AGRICULTURE. THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON FELLOW IN MEDICINE. THEY WORK IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY WORK ABROAD FOR THREE YEARS, THEY COME BACK, GET THREE YEARS TO PROVE THEMSELVES IN THE COMPANIES, WE HAVE A NEW  WORKFORCE WITH A NEW SKILL SET AND WE NEED BIG, BOLD IDEAS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVERYBODY  COULD GET EXCITED ABOUT.
Jon:  WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE SOME TYPE OF ENLISTMENT PROGRAM. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MILITARY. YOU MAKE THE POINT IN THE BOOK, THE MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES BEAR THIS SACRIFICE. AND YOU MENTION THE 1% OF THE COUNTRY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THAT. WHAT ABOUT ENLISTMENT SERVICE, NOT MILITARY-BASED, BUT MAYBE PEOPLE'S CHOICE, GIVING A YEAR  OF SERVICE OF SOMEBODY'S TIME. WHY CAN'T THAT TAKE PLACE?
I'D BE ALL FOR IT. WHAT I'M JUST TRYING TO DO IS KICK-START THE CONVERSATION WITH  THE PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY IDEA. LET'S START TALKING ABOUT IT. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN GET TO IT. WHEN I FIRST PROPOSED IT TO SOME FRIENDS OF MINE, ONE TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY CONSERVATIVE SOUTH  TEXAS BUSINESS MAN AND SAID MAKE IT PUBLIC-PRIVATE, GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVED. I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT IDEA. THAT'S WHY I PUT THAT IN THERE. I TALKED TO A LOT OF C.E.O.s AND OTHERS AND THEY SAID IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT. THE 1% VERSUS THE 99% IS A CONTINUING ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE 1% OF THE COUNTRY IS  DOING 100% OF THE FIGHTING, TAKING 100% OF THE BULLETS. NOTHING IS ASKED OF THE REST OF US. THAT 1% NOW WILL BEGIN TO COME THOAM A BROKEN ECONOMY. THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING THE BAD GUYS FOR 10 YEARS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING FOR THIS KIND OF AN ECONOMY AND WE  NEED TO NOT JUST SAY," HEY, WELCOME BACK, BUDDY," AND WALK AWAY. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO REINTDWRAIT THEM INTO SOCIETY AND FIND WORK FOR THEM AND MAKE  SURE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY RETURN TO THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.
Jon:  YOU'VE GOT THIS GROUP OF-- ( APPLAUSE ). BUT YOU DO-- YOU HAVE THIS GROUP OF INCREDIBLY TALENTED AND DETERMINED INDIVIDUALS WHO  CLEARLY KNOW HOW TO REBUILD COUNTRIES. WE COULD USE REBUILDING. IT SEEMS LIKE A NICE MATCH.
WELL, THE FACT IS THAT THEY ARE WELL TRAINED AT AN EARLY AGE. THEY KNOW ABOUT DISCIPLINE. THEY KNOW ABOUT RISK ASSESSMENT. THEY KNOW ABOUT MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES. AND THEY KNOW ABOUT GOING INTO HOSTILE SITUATIONS AND MAKING A QUICK SIZING UP ABOUT WHAT'S AT  RISK HERE.
Jon:  YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT NEW JERSEY WHEN YOU SAID HOSTILE. ( LAUGHTER ). "THE TIME OF OUR LIVES" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. A CONVERSATION STARTE
