WELCOME BACK WE'RE HERE WITH MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO. SO NOW LET'S TALK. SO ONE OF YOUR FIRST INITIATIVES WAS, YOU SAID YOU ARE GOING TO CLOSE THE OLD CARRIAGES -- HOUSES SO THAT THE HORSES CAN GO WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM BUT HOPEFULLY THEY GET BETTER LIVES SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU SAID DAY ONE -- IT HASN'T HAPPENED. WILL THIS BE YOUR GITMO? WILL THIS BE, WILL THE CARRIAGE HORSES BE TRAPPED IN THIS LIMBO. CAUSE WE'RE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND I HEAR THEIR PLAINTIVE CRIES.
THE WATERBOARDING OF THE HORSES HAS TO END. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.
Jon: THAT'S WISE. IS IT A DIFFICULT THING TO EXECUTE? DO YOU HAVE TO...
IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS: IN A HUMANE SOCIETY, I REALLY BELIEVE THIS, HORSES DO NOT BELONG IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC OF NEW YORK CITY, THEY DON'T BELONG IN AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THIS. IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THEM. IT'S NOT FAIR WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE AND WHAT OUR SOCIETY IS LIKE. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: THIS BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT. SHOULD WE EVEN BE LIVING HERE? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CAUSE IT IS A LITTLE -- SOMETIMES I LOOK AT THEIR STABLE AND I GO LIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD GO FOR $1600 A MONTH, WHAT DO YOU THINK? [LAUGHTER]
YOU USED TO LIVE IN A CARRIAGE I UNDERSTAND.
Jon: NO NO. UNDERNEATH THERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ONE, STOP AND FRISK. THERE WAS A CHALLENGE -- IT WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. NEW YORK CITY HAD PROFFERED A CHALLENGE TO THAT. YOU HAVE ENDED THAT.
I HAVE.
Jon: THERE WILL BE NO STOP AND FRISK.
WE'VE COME TO A SETTLEMENT.
Jon: WHAT IS THE SETTLEMENT?
LOOK, WHAT I SAID WAS YOU CANNOT -- IT'S A SIMPLE IDEA, OUR NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER BILL BRATTON, WHO'S FANTASTIC, SAYS YOU CAN'T BREAK THE LAW TO ENFORCE THE LAW. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WHAT WE HAD FOR YEARS WAS YOUNG MEN OF COLOR OVERWHELMINGLY THEY WERE THE ONES SINGLED OUT, TREATED AS SUSPECTS EVEN IF THEY HADN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. STOP AND FRISK, IN ITS HEYDAY, WE HAD ALMOST 700,000 STOPS IN A SINGLE YEAR AND ALMOST 90% OF THEM WERE INNOCENT PEOPLE,  IN EVERY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. NO SUMMONS, NO CHARGE, NO NOTHING. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PROCEED IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. I ARGUE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES HAVE TO MARCH HAND IN  HAND. YOU CANNOT SEPARATE OR OPPOSE THE TWO. AND IN THE STOP AND FRISK ERA WE HAD TWO DIFFERENT FORMS OF POLICING THAT'S THE REALITY. DEPENDING ON THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN. WHAT WE DID THE OTHER DAY WAS SETTLED WITH THE CIVIL LIBERTIES GROUPS AND I WAS STANDING THERE WITH THE POLICE COMMISSIONER AND LAWYERS FOR THE CITY AND SAID WE ACTUALLY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER TO REFORM THE SYSTEM SO POLICE AND COMMUNITY CAN COME BACK TOGETHER.
Jon: BUT WILL IT CHANGE ALSO THE DEEPER ISSUE WHICH IS WHEN SOME OF THESE WHITE KIDS GET CAUGHT WITH DOPE OR COCAINE OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE SCAMPS, THEY'RE GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GETTING WILD A BLACK KID GETS CAUGHT WITH THAT, HE GOES TO JAIL. OVERWHELMINGLY THAT IS DISPROPORTIONAL IN THAT WORLD. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT? NOT JUST AT ITS POINT OF ENTRY ON THE STREET BUT WITHIN THE COURT SYSTEM AS WELL?
A LOT HAS TO CHANGE IN OUR LAWS. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ON THE RIGHT TRACK TO SAY THAT THESE UNEQUAL LEGAL STANDARDS HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AND REFORMED. BUT EVEN HOW WE POLICE. UNTIL RECENTLY IN NEW YORK CITY IF YOU WERE STOPPED AND FRISKED AND YOU BROUGHT EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR POCKETS AND LET'S SAY THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF MARIJUANA THERE. RIGHT THERE, THE DISPLAY OF MARIJUANA WAS A DIFFERENT CHARGE THAN HAVING IT IN YOUR POCKET. ONCE IT'S DISPLAYED YOU WERE BREAKING THE LAW AND THEN THE KID IS SADDLED WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD. WE'VE ENDED THAT AS A MATTER OF POLICY. WE SAID, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE A CRIMINAL RECORD FOR DOING NOTHING. AND THAT DISPROPORTIONALLY HIT KIDS OF COLOR. SO THIS IS ABOUT RETOOLING OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM TOWARDS THE NOTION WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SEND PEOPLE TO JAIL WHO HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
Jon: HOW FRIGHTENED ARE PEOPLE WHEN YOU WALK IN BECAUSE THEY MUST THINK NOW YOU'RE COMING IN THERE AND TURNING EVERYTHING UPSIDE DOWN, THE UNCERTAINTY MUST BE PALPABLE AT CITY HALL.
I DON'T WEAR THE CHE GUEVARA T-SHIRT AT WORK. >>Jon: ALRIGHT, I THINK THAT'S WISE. I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. I'M BLESSED TO HAVE A MANDATE FROM THE PEOPLE TO MAKE SOME REAL PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR I TALKED ABOUT THE TALE OF  TWO CITIES WE WERE LIVING. THIS WAS ALL ABOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE INEQUALITIES THAT BECOME VERY FUNDAMENTAL AND UNFORTUNATELY GROWING IN OUR CITY AND GOING AT THEM WHETHER IT'S INEQUALITY OF HOW POLICING WAS DONE OR INEQUALITY IN TERMS OF INCOME OR INEQUALITY IN TERMS OF EDUCATION. THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY ARE READY TO ACTUALLY TAKE THAT ON HEAD ON. SO, YES, THERE ARE SOME BUREAUCRATS AND OTHERS WHO ARE HESITANT  BUT I KNOW THE POPULAR SUPPORT IS THERE.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENJOYED A MORE ABSOLUTE POSITION IN THE CITY SOMEWHAT UNASSAILABLE THAT THAT IS FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE AND NOT PERSECUTION? HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THEM THAT THE LOSS OF A MORE ABSOLUTE POWER IS NOT PERSECUTION?
THIS COMES UP FOR EXAMPLE WITH OUR PLAN TO TAX THE WEALTHY  FOR PRE-K AND AFTER SCHOOL. I'VE SAID, ANYONE WHO MAKES A HALF MILLION OR MORE PAYS  A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THEIR CITY TAXES. WHAT DOES IT ALLOW US TO DO? FULL DAY PRE-K FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE CITY, AFTERSCHOOL FOR EVERY MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT FOR FREE, GUARANTEED.  IT WOULD BE TRANSCENDENT IN TERMS OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. IT WOULD TOTALLY ALLOW US TO PREPARE OUR KIDS PROPERLY.
Jon: YOU AND CUOMO ARE FIGHTING ABOUT IT. HE SAYS I'LL PAY FOR IT FROM THE STATE AND YOU SAY I'LL PAY FROM THE CITY WHY CAN'T WE GO 50/50 ON THIS BAD BOY? >>YOU KNOW, I LIKE THE YOU THINK, BUT BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW THE MONEY'S GONNA BE THERE YEAR AFTER YEAR. AND THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET THAT IS IF WE HAVE A TAX HERE THAT WE CONTROL HERE IN THE CITY.  AND IF WE TAX THOSE WHO MAKE A HALF MILLION OR MORE, THEY CAN HANDLE IT. THE EQUIVALENT FOR SOMEONE WHO MAKES BETWEEN $500,000 AND A MILLION DOLLARS IS THE PRICE OF A SMALL SOY LATTE AT STARBUCKS  ONCE A DAY.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. CAN I, IF I, CAUSE I-- CAUSE I'M GONNA END UP PAYING A LITTLE BIT MORE. CAN I GO TO THE PRE-K AND BE LIKE YOU ARE MINE! [LAUGHTER] AND SO YOU BETTER GET THOSE GRADES UP BECAUSE I'M ON YOUR ASS.
WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A PROGRAM FOR YOU-- >>Jon: THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. >>THAT ALLOWS YOU TO DO THAT. I THINK YOU DESERVE THAT RIGHT.
Jon: SO THE 50/50 THING NO FLY THOUGH?
I THINK WE NEED MORE RELIABLE MONEY. >>Jon: THAN FROM THE STATE? >>WELL THE STATE HASN'T OFFERED A SPECIFIC DOLLAR FIGURE.  THEY CERTAINLY HAVEN'T OFFERED THE FIVE YEARS WE NEED. THIS IS A FIVE YEAR $2.6 BILLION PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHILD GETS A STRONG START IN SCHOOL.
Jon: COULDN'T BLOOMBERG CHUCKED THAT IN ON HIS WAY OUT? THREW IT INTO A POT.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GRATUITY. >>Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: HEY THANKS FOR HAVING ME AS MAYOR, NICE JOB HAVE SOME PRE-K.
Mayor: SOMETHING FOR YOU, PAL. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT HERE'S IS THE THING. WHEN I TALK TO WEALTHIER FOLKS AND SAY WE WANT YOU TO PAY A LITTLE MORE SO WE CAN DO THIS. SOME PEOPLE GET UPSET AND SAY ARE YOU TRYING TO PUNISH SUCCESS. I SAY WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUNISH SUCCESS WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE MORE SUCCESS STORIES. WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE KIDS A CHANCE TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE PEOPLE IS THAT HAVE DONE VERY WELL IN THIS CITY  HAVE DONE WELL IN THIS CITY BECAUSE OF THE OPPORTUNITY  THAT THIS CITY AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE OFFERED US. AND I THINK IT IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO TO, AS THEY SAY, PAY IT FORWARD. THIS IS NOT YOU HAVE TO GIVE US 95% OF YOUR MONEY. THIS IS, I THINK, A REASONABLE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT. THAT BEING SAID, THE FEAR IS WE RETURN TO A DIFFERENT TIME IN NEW YORK WHEN IT WAS LESS ORDERLY AND THINGS WERE MORE CHAOTIC AND HOW DO YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE CHANGE BUT DONE IN A MANNER THAT IS MUCH MORE REASONABLY PRESCRIBED?
WHENEVER YOU SEE A PROGRESSIVE MOMENT. WHENEVER YOU SEE PROGRESSIVE LEADERS COME INTO OFFICE THAT CHARGE IS THROWN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MORE COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY, SOMEHOW IT'S GOING TO CONNECT WITH THIS ORDER. IT'S SPECIOUS. IT'S NOT TRUE. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE KNOW THE GREAT THREAT TO THIS COUNTRY IS INEQUALITY. THE GREAT THREAT TO THIS CITY IS INEQUALITY. IF WE HAVE RAMPANT, GROWING INEQUALITY IT'S GOING TO BE UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THE LONG TERM. PEOPLE NEED A CORE HOPE IN OUR SOCIETY, A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET SOMEWHERE. THEY NEED A CORE AMOUNT OF VISIBILE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT'S BEEN SLIPPING AWAY. SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DESTABILIZING REALITIES IN OUR SOCIETY  TALK ABOUT INEQUALITY. BUT PROGRESSIVES CAN RUN GOVERNMENTS EFFECTIVELY.  PROGRESSIVES CAN BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. PROGRESSIVES CAN FOCUS ON PUBLIC SAFETY BUT WE'RE GONNA DO IT  IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS PEOPLES' RIGHTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I'LL HAVE YOU BACK IN THREE YEARS. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] MAYOR BILL DEBLASIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
