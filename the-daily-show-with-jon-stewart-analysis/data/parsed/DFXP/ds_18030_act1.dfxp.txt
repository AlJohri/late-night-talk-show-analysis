Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. WE HAVE A FINE ONE TONIGHT. OUR GOOD FRIEND CALVIN  TRILLIN FROM CALVIN TRILLIN  & HOBBS, THE GREAT CARTOON,  CALVIN TRILLIN, YOU REMEMBER HIM PEEING BY THE WALL, AND  THERE IS A TIGER. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, QUICK, OFF THE TOP, YOU  REMEMBER THAT CONTEST, THE  OBAMA CAMPAIGN HAD, YOU DONATE AND YOU MIGHT WIN  LUNCH WITH THE PRESIDENT? (LAUGHTER)  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE  WHO WON! (LAUGHTER)
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA,  MITT ROMNEY JUST WRACHED UP  LUNCH IN THE PRIVATE DINING ROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE  IT-- MITT ROMNEY, THE GUY IS  JUST LUCKY! HE PROBABLY BARELY DONATED  MUCH MONEY AT ALL BUT HE  STILL GOT--   (LAUGHTER)  THE EVENT WAS ACTUALLY CLOSED TO CAMERAS BUT WE DO  HAVE FOOTAGE OF GOVERNOR  ROMNEY ARRIVING AT THE WHITE  HOUSE. I BELIEVE THAT IS HIM THERE  AND THEN HE'S GETTING OUT  AND THEN--   (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S-- CAMPAIGN IS OVER. SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO  PRE-- PRETEND ANY MORE. CAN WEAR THAT SERENGETI LION  SASH HE HADN'T BEEN WEARING. BY THE WAY, OBAMA COULDN'T  HAVE MET THE GUY IN A  RESTAURANT? HAD TO MAKE HIM COME TO THE  WHITE HOUSE? THAT'S SOME COLD BREW. HEY, ROMNEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN,  HEY, SN IT FUNNY, YOU ALMOST  LIVED HERE. YEAH, THIS WAS ALMOST YOUR  PLACE, 3 MILLION BUS, YOU  KNOW WHAT I MEAN? OH YOU WORKED SO HARD FOR  SEVEN YEARS AND-- YOU WERE  JUST ABOUT TO KNOCK AND GO IN AND-- [BLEEP] ANYWAY,  CHECK OUT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN  MISSING. IF YOU LIVED HERE YOU COULD  BE DOING RIGHT NOW, WATCH  THIS, WATCH THIS GIVE ME A MONTE CHRIS O SAN WITCH, YOU  LIKE ADELE, GET ME ADELE ON  THE PHONE TOO. HAVE HER SING ROLLING IN THE  DEEP AND ALSO FIRE A MISSILE  AT KARACHI, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. BOOM, THAT'S A LITTLE PLAY I  DID. OBAMA IN THE WHITE HOUSE. ALL RIGHT. THINGS ARE PRETTY SWEET FOR  MR. OBAMA THESE DAYS. LIVING LARGE, HE'S IN  CHARGE. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
JUST 33 DAYS LEFT UNTIL  WE HIT THAT DISASTROUS  COMBINATION OF TAX RATE INCREASES AND SPENDING CUTS  NOW KNOWN AS THE FISCAL  CLIFF.
Jon: OH, YEAH, THAT, THAT  WAS--   (LAUGHTER)  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE  FISCAL-- CLIFF.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF  TONIGHT'S CLIFFPOCALYPSEMA  GET-- MAGEDDONOCAUST, OUR NATION'S SOLVABLE BUDGET  PROBLEM. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I ACTUALLY HURT MY  SHOULDER JUST THERE. IT'S LIKE I'M 50. SO WE'RE NOW JUST A LITTLE  MORE THAN A MONTH AWAY FROM  GOING OVER THE FISCAL CLIFF WHICH IS, OF COURSE, AS WE  ALL, WHAT IS THE FISCAL  CLIFF AGAIN?
A TOXIC COMBINATION OF  SPENDING CUTS AND TAX  INCREASES THAT KICKS IN AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR.
ON JANUARY 1s ITS BUSH  TAX CUTS WILL ECK PRIOR  WITHIN THE ALTERNATIVE  MINIMUM CONTINUATION WOULD QUICK IN, HIKING TAXES FOR  MORE THAN HALF MARRIED  COUPLES WITH TWO CHILDREN. THE PAYROLL TAX CUT WAS ALSO  EXPIRE.
EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS END, AND 984  BILLION DOLLARS IN THE  AUTOMATIC CUTS IN BOTH DEFENSE AND DOMESTIC BUDGETS  ARE TRIGGERED.
IT VERY LIKELY THAT WE'RE  ALL GOING DIE.
Jon: WHY DID THEY PUT  THAT LAST PROVISION IN. SEE, HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED. TWO SUMMERS AGO CONGRESS  REALIZED THAT IF THEY  COULDN'T COMPROMISE ON A  DEFICIT AND REVENUE PLAN OUR ECONOMY WOULD KRAFERNLT  TURNS OUT THEY COULDN'T  COMPROMISE. SO HERE'S WHAT THEY DID. IN ORDER TO FORCE THEMSELVES  TO WORK TOGETHER AND  COMPROMISE THEY CONCOCTED A  CATASTROPHIC PENALTY THAT WOULD ITSELF CRASH OUR  ECONOMY. BRILLIANT! PUT IT ANOTHER WAY. IF THERE IS AN ASTEROID HEADED  TOWARDS THE EARTH. WE MADE IT AND FIRED IT AT  OURSELVES. (LAUGHTER)  BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WOULD  NEVER HAVE DONE THE HARD  WORK REQUIRED TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THE ASTEROID. SO THE ASTEROID IS COMINGS. WHERE ARE WE AT.
IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT  REDUCING THE DEFICIT, WE  HAVE TO COMBINE SPENDING CUTS WITH REVENUE.
THAT'S KIND OF AN  EASY-- THAT SEEMS VERY  SOLVABLE. DEMS WANT REVENUE THROUGH  MARGINAL TAX INCREASES ON  THE WEALTHY. THE REPUBLICANS WANT  ENTITLEMENT CUTS.
RAISING TAX RATES IS  UNACCEPTABLE.
Jon: WELL, LET'S JUST  CHECK IN WITH THE DEMOCRATS  AND SEE WHERE THEY ARE AT ON ENTITLE AM REFORM.
MR. DURBIN, THE NUMBER  TWO MAN IN THE SENATE AND  OTHER DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING ENTITLEMENTS FOR THIS FISCAL  CLIFF DEAL ARE OFF THE TABLE.
Jon: OKAY SO, THE ONLY  WAY TO SOLVE THERE SEN  TITLEMENT REFORM AND TAX REVENUE AND THOSE ARE BOTH  OFF THE TABLE SO-- I DON'T  WANT TO CLOSE MY EYES ♪  ♪ I DON'T WANT TO FALL ASLEEP ♪  ♪ BECAUSE I MISS YOU GIRL ♪  ♪ DON'T WANT TO MISS A  THING ♪  ♪  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: REALLY? PEN MICROPHONE? I GUESS THIS MEANS THERE'S  NO WAY OF AVOIDING THE  FISCAL CLIFF, THE  SELF-IMPOSED FISCAL-FRIENDLY  FIRE. UNLESS, NO, NO, WAY. I COULD NEVER -- PERHAPS. WE CAN SOLVE THIS NUMBERS  PROBLEM WITH WORDS.
FRANKLY I CALL THE FISCAL  ABYSS.
MORE LIKE Y2 K.
MORE LIKE A BERMUDA TRY  AND EGG.
MORE LIKE A GRAND CANYON.
TAXMAGEDDON.
IT'S A HILL.
Jon: HILL, HILL, THAT  LAST ONE I LIKE THAT LAST  ONE. HILLS ARE MUCH LESS SCARY  THAN CLIFFS. OR CANYONS OR BOMBS, OR  MAGEDDONS. RATHER THAN FIXING THERE,  WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL THIS  BAD THING SOMETHING LESS  BAD.
IT'S MORE LIKE A FISCAL  SLOPE.
I THINK IT'S AN AUSTERITY  SLOPING CRISIS OF SOME KIND.
Jon: NOW WE'RE COOKING  WITH GAS, OR WHATEVER WE'RE  RENAMING THE COMPRESSED FUEL VAPORS IGNITED FOR FOOD  PREPARATION BUT HILL IT'S  AND SLOPES YOU CAN STILL  FALL. JACK AND JILL WE REMEMBER  PAID A TERRIBLE PRICE. TRAVERSING A HILL, BROKEN  CROWN, WATER EVERYWHERE. REALLY THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF  THEIR WALK UP THE HILL WENT  FOR NAUGHT.
IT'S MORE LIKE A GAERND. WHAT DO I MEAN BY GARDEN.
Jon: YES, YES, A FISCAL  GARDEN. (LAUGHTER)  THAT SOUNDS GOOD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GARDEN. BASE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING  OVER A CLIFF.
THERE'S NO SINGLE GROUP  AT THE TOP THAT CAN MANAGE  THAT GARDEN. IN A TOP DOWN FASHION. IT'S GOING TO BE ORGANIC,  IT'S GOING TO BE BOTTOM UP. AND THERE ARE THINGS THEY  CAN DO TO HARM THINGS, LIKE  YOU SAID RELEASING A FEDS WOULDN'T BE GOOD BUT THE  REAL PROBLEM IS-- .
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, I DON'T  KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT ANY MORE, BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE I LIKE  YOUR POINT. OUR COUNTRY FACES A FISCAL  DISASTER AND WE DON'T HAVE  TO COMPROMISE OR FIX IT. BECAUSE WE CAN JUST SIT BACK  IN OUR GARDEN AND ENJOY THE  FRUITS AND FLOWERY AROMAS OF WASHINGTON IN DECEMBER.
