WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE  PUBLISHER OF THE FANTASTIC  SCOTUS BLOTION, PLEASE  WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW TOM  GOLDSTEIN. (APPLAUSE)  WFERNING.
WOW.
THANK YOU SOOCH FOR  HAVING ME BACK ON WHAT IS  STILL THE BEST SHOW ON  TELEVISION.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. READING BETWEEN THE LINE  THERE, STILL DESPITE THE  FACT IT'S IN THE HANDS OF AN  IMPOSTOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE. YOU MUST BE TIRED. YOU'VE HAD QUITE A WEEK.
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN  STRIKING THINS DOWN AND  UPHOLDING THEM LIKE IT'S GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT --
AND IT IS VERY MUCH NOT  GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE LITTLE  DETAILS YESTERDAY WAS YOU  HAVE A SCOTUS BLOG HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT AS WELL. AND WE WERE WATCHING PEOPLE  TWEET AT YOU THINKING YOU  WERE ACTUALLY THE SUPREME  COURT. YOU'VE DESTROYED THE COUNTRY,  HASHTAG FAIL.
I HAD NO IDEA HOW SMART  PEOPLE ARE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. SUPERGENIUSES OUT THERE THAT  ARE CON FINS-- CONVINCED.
WE ALL SAW THOSE MOMENTS  WHERE THE INTERNS ARE  RUNNING OUT, PHYSICALLY, WITH PIECES OF PAPER IF YOUR  HANDS AND YOU THINK THAT'S  CRAZY, IT'S ON THE INTERNET. BUT IT'S NOT.
NO, THE SUPREME COURT IS  MAKING ITS WAY NOT 19th  CENTURY IT HAS A WEB SITE  NOW,.
TECHNICALLY AND MORALLY --
THEY HAVE DISCOVERED THE  INTERNET. THEIR SITES HAVE A WEB SITE,  IT'S ON A LITTLE BIT OF A  TAPE DELAY.
SO AS THEY'RE RUNNING OUT  WITH THOSE PHYSICAL PIECES  OF PAPER THEY'RE STILL  TALKING.
THE JUSTICES ARE UPSTAIRS  IN THE COURTROOM EXPLAINING  WHAT IT IS THEY'VE DONE. AND JUSTICE SCALIA IS ABOUT  TO GO OFF EXPLAINING WHY IT  IS THE END OF THE WORLD. AND THEY HAND OUT THE  OPINION DOWNSTAIRS AND IT  GETS RUN OUT TO THE TV  CAMERA.
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT JUSTICE SCALIA GOING  OFF AS YOU POLITELY PUT IT. HE DID GO OFF. AND HE DOES LIKE TO GO OFF. HE TALKED ABOUT THE DISEASED  ROOT OF THIS TERRIBLE  DECISION. AND HOW THE REST OF THE  JUSTICES BASICALLY DID NOT  UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUPREME  COURT WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK. HOW DID THAT GO DOWN WHEN  YOU ARE SITTING NEXT TO HIM  GOING, HEY! IT MUST BE WEIRD FOR THE  OTHER JUSTICESES.
ARE THEY USED TO HIM  BEING CANTANKEROUS.
EACH OF THEM HAS THEIR  OWN PERSONALITY AND CAN SAY  ANYTHING THEY WANT IT IS AN AMAZING THING, A GREAT OR  HORRIBLE THING ABOUT LIFE  TENURE. IT IS YOUR WORD AND YOU GET  TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS YOU  THINK THE LAW SHOULD BEMENT AND DOW SIT THERE, AND  JUSTICE SCALIA CAN LOOK  ACROSS THE BENCH AND SAY YOU  ARE A MORAL ABOMINATION OR YOUR DECISION IS PROBABLY  HOW HE WOULD EXPLAIN IT. AND YOU CAN SAY THE SAME  THING BACK, SO --
THAT IS TRUE. THAT IS TRUE. NOW THERE WAS SOME  INTERESTING ANALYSIS TODAY  OF THE PROP 8 DECISION WHICH  SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING COULD BE ARGUED JUST TO APPLY TO  THOSE TWO COUPLES IT  QUESTION AND HAVE NO BROADER  SIGNIFICANCE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT?
OKAY. SO PROPOSITION 8 SAYS THAT  CALIFORNIA WON'T RECOGNIZE  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. A COUPLE OF COUPLES SUED THE  TRIAL JUDGE AND SAID THERE  IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THEN 2 GOES UP TO THE COURT  OF APPEALS AND THE SUPREME  COURT. AND THE SUPREME COURT SAYS  ALL OF THAT WAS KIND OF A  MISTAKE. WE DIDN'T MEAN IT. NONE OF THE DEFENDERS OF  PROPOSITION 8 EVER HAD THE  RIGHT TO BE IN URT COULD. SO IT'S JUST LEFT WITH THOSE  TWO COUPLES. BUT THE GOVERNOR OF  CALIFORNIA, THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL OF CAT CALL HAVE  SAID WE NEVER THOUGHT PROPOSITION 8 WAS  CONSTITUTIONAL. AND SO THEY ARE DIRECTING  ALL THE CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS  TO ISSUE SAME-SEX MARRIAGES STARTING IN ABOUT A MONTH.
SO--   (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
BUT YOU'RE SAYING-- YOU'RE  SAYING THAT TECHNICALLY AT  THE MOMENT IT IS THAT NARROW THAT RULING.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AT THIS MOMENT, BECAUSE THE  COURT OF APPEALS PUT  EVERYTHING ON HOLD UNTIL THE  SUPREME COURT COULD DECIDE THE CASE, EVERYBODY IS  SITTING GOING, IF I DAY NOW. BUT THERE'S THIS LEGAL  PROCESS. IT KEEPS LAWYERS EMPLOYED  AND THAT MAKES IT A GOOD  THING. AND WE'RE JUST, YOU JUST  NEED TO WAIT FOR US AND  WE'LL GET AROUND TO IT.
SO IT COULD BE THAT WE DO  CIVIL RIGHTS ON A  CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT BROWN  VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION  POTENTIALLY ONLY APPLIED TO  BROWN?
I THINK I KNOW A CERTAIN  SOUTHERN LADY-- WHO WOULD BE  QUITE INTERESTED IN IT.
SHE IS WHAT SHE IS. SHE IS WHAT SHE IS. THE DOMO RULING IN  PARTICULAR THAT IS A MOMENTUS  RULING IN U.S. HISTORY.
THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF  LOOKING AT THE DOMO RULE,  WHICH ITS OWN TERMS IT SAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE  CONSTITUTION REQUIRES IT TO  RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX  MARRIAGES. NOW THE LEGAL THEORY IS THAT  THOSE MARRIAGES HAVE EQUAL  FOOTING. THEY DESERVE RESPECT. AND SO THERE'S A LEGAL  DECISION ITSELF IS  IMPORTANT. BUT THE MORAL MESSAGE IS  MUCH BIGGER. IT IS THE MAJORITY OF THE  SUPREME COURT WHICH 25 YEARS  AGO WROTE A HORRIBLE  DECISION DISPARAGING GAYS HAS TURNED AROUND AND SAID  WE THINK YOU'RE ACTUALLY  HUMAN BEINGS. (APPLAUSE)
BUT THEY HAD TO MAKE AN  ARGUMENT FOR THAT.
AND IT WAS CLOSE.
AND IT WAS CLOSE.
RIGHT.
IT WAS 5-4 YOU'RE HUMAN  BEINGS.
YEAH. (LAUGHTER)
RIGHT, AND SO WHAT THIS  PROBABLY DOES IS IT DOESN'T  CREATE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SAME-SOLICITOR-GENERAL  MARRIAGE IN ANY OF THE OTHER  STATESES THAT DON'T RECOGNIZE IT BUT FOR THE  MOMENTUM IN THE STATES, FOR  THE PEOPLE IN STATE  LEGISLATURE SAYING LOOK, WHAT WES WANT IS JUST  EQUALITY, NOT SPECIAL  TREATMENT THIS GIVES IT AN  ADDITIONAL PUSH. AND THE SUPREME COURT,  PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES  OBVIOUSLY CARE A LOT ABOUT  IT. SO IT IS A GREAT MORAL  MESSAGE.
AND JUSTICE SCALIA SAW  THIS COMING. BECAUSE IN THE 20023  DECISION WHERE ALL OF A  SUDDEN SODOMY WAS LEGAL, IN  2003, THIS 2003, THE ONE THAT JUST WANT PASSED, HE  SAID OH, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS  IN THE WIND, GAY MARRIAGE.
EVERYONE LAUGHED AND SAID  NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. BUT IT IS AMAZING HOW FAR  THIS COUNTRY HAS COME.
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING  LIKE IT.
ONE OF THE MOST  INCREDIBLE THINGS WAS ALSO  THAT THE NORMAL SEE OF THE  REACTION TO IT, AS WELL.
EXACTLY.
YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT  THAT OUT ON THE STEPS OF THE  SUPREME COURT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOCIAL  CONSERVATIVES GOING  ABSOLUTELY NUTS. INSTEAD WHAT THERE WAS WAS  CHOIRS SINGING, PEOPLE  HUGGING, PEOPLE TALKING  ABOUT WILL YOU MARRY ME. AND IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE HOW  ONE-SIDED AND HOW THE REST  OF THE COUNTRY DIDN'T REGARD THISES ALIKE AAAHHH.
BECAUSE IT'S JUST FINE.
IT TURNED OUT IT WORKED  OUT OKAY.
IT TURNS OUT IT IS OKAY. DO YOU HAVE TIME TO STICK  AROUND AND GO TO THE WEB.
YES.
SCOTUS BLOG IS FANTASTIC. FIND IT ON THE INTERNET. TOM GOLDSTEIN.
