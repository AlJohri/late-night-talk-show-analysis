Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT HE'S GOT A GREAT NEW FILM. IT'S CALLED X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST.
I WAS SENT HERE FOR YOU.
WELL TELL WHOEVER IT WAS THAT SENT YOU THAT I'M BUSY.
IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE TRICKY BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO SENT ME WAS YOU.
WHAT?
ABOUT 50 YEARS FROM NOW.
50 YEARS FROM NOW LIKE IN THE FUTURE. 50 YEARS FROM NOW?
YEAH.
I SENT YOU FROM THE FUTURE.
YEAH.
IF YOU HAD YOUR POWERS YOU WOULD KNOW I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.
HOW DO YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE MY-- ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE PIQUED MY INTEREST, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I NEED YOUR HELP.
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
Jon: PIQUED MY INTEREST AS WELL. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JAMES MCAVOY. (APPLAUSE) MARVELOUS! THIS IS THE ONE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. THIS IS FOR THE X-MEN AFFICIONADO THIS, THIS SEQUENCE IS, IS REALLY THE PINNACLE OF THE, OF THE X-MEN SERIES. YOU AS A YOUNG PROFESSOR X MEETING UP WITH -- WELL, IN THE COMIC STRIP IT'S NOT WOLVERINE. BUT,  KITTY PRYDE, I THINK IS THE --
YEAH, KITTY PRYDE IS THE WHO GET SENT BACK IN THE, YOU'RE, YOU'RE A FAN OF X-MEN?
NO. NO, WHAT? WHAT, YOU THIN, I'M A 51 YEAR OLD MAN. I MEAN, COME ON. WHAT DO YOU THINK I SIT AROUND READING COMIC BOOKS, YEAH, JUST WHY DIDN'T THEY USE KITTY PRYDE? I WAS JUST SURPRISED BY THAT. THAT'S ALL.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY SENT WOLVERINE BACK. PROBABLY BECAUSE IT IS PLAYED BY HUGH JACKMAN WHO'S THE SINGLE MOST CHARISMATIC MAN I THINK I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.
IT'S A LITTLE, IT'S CRAZY ISN'T IT?
YEAH. INCREDIBLE.
HE'S, HE'S QUITE CHARISMATIC THERE. THE IDEA, YOU AS PROFESSOR X AS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAS, IS SQUANDERING HIS POWERS ON THE DRINK, ON THE DRUGS.
NOT ON THE LADIES. WHAT IS HE THINKING?
NO, BUT STILL MOBILE. WHEN YOU AND PATRICK STEWART GOT, AM I GIVING-- SHOULD I --
NO, NO, NO. IT'S IN THE TRAILER. YOU CAN, YOU CAN. IT'S IN THE TRAILER. NO, DO. NO DO.
WHEN WOLVERINE COMES BACK AND YOU DIE, WHAT-- . I'M JUST KIDDING, I'M KIDDING.  THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
IN THE HEAD.  YEAH.
Jon: DID YOU-- DID YOU, HOW DID YOU GUYS PLAY THAT IDEA, OF YOU'RE SCOTTISH, HE'S BRITISH, HOW DID YOU PLAY THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE A YOUNG HIM, CLEARLY YOUR HAIR IS STILL THERE.
IT, IT IS. IT IS. WELL, YOU KNOW THERE IS NO POINT IN GOING BACK TO THE 60s AND 70s IF THEY WEREN'T DIFFERENT.
YEAH.
AND WE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING THAT PATRICK WAS AND EVERYTHING THAT PATRICK DID AND TRIED TO DO SOMETHING AS FAR AWAY FROM THAT AS POSSIBLE. NOT BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB. HE DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB,
RIGHT. BUT IS SO THAT WE CAN THEN MOVE TOWARDS IT OVER THE COURSE OF MOVIES. SO THE OBVIOUS ONE IS TO GO WITH THE VISUAL AND GO RIGHT, HE HAS NO HAIR, I'M GOING HAVE HAIR. HE WAS REALLY NICE TO EVERYBODY I'M GOING TO BE REALLY NASTY TO EVERYBODY. SO HONESTLY IT WAS THAT SIMPLE.
RIGHT. WAS IT, WAS THE BEST PART OF IT GOING AGAINST YOURSELF?
OH, IF THAT MEANS, IS THAT A EPHEMISM FOR SOMETHING?
YOU AND PATRICK.
OH, RIGHT. I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
YEAH, THAT WAS NOT A EPHEMISM, NO.
RIGHT, I WAS LIKE GOING AGAINST YOURSELF? IS THAT WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU READ X-MEN COMICS ON YOUR OWN? [LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW ME WELL.
IT HAS TO BE SAID THAT I'VE BEEN PUSHING THIS MOVIE FOR TWO WEEKS NOW AND I'VE REALIZE ABOUT MYSELF THAT I'M JUST A WALKING DICK JOKE. I JUST, I'VE MADE MORE DICK JOKES IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS THAN I THINK COMBINED FORCES OF NORTH AMERICA COULD MUSTER.
Jon: WELL, YOU REALLY SHOULD SEE SOME TAPES OF THIS SHOW. WE'RE RIGHT UP THERE WITH YOU, MY FRIEND.
OK. NICE. YOU'RE A BUSY, BUSY MAN. AND I DO APPRECIATE IT. YOU HAVE BEEN ON THREE CONTINENTS IN TWO DAYS OR FOUR CONTINENTS PROMOTING.
YEAH, OH, PROMOTING. OH, SELLING. I AM A PROFESSIONAL SALESMAN --
YOU ARE. WHERE WERE YOU?
-- I WORK FOR THE MAN.
WHERE WERE YOU?
I WAS IN LONDON FOR FIVE DAYS, THEN I WAS IN NORTH-- I WAS IN NEW YORK FOR SIX DAYS AND I WAS IN SAO, NO LONDON FOR TWO MORE DAYS AFTER THAT, THEN SAO PAULO FOR TWO DAYS, THEN KENT FOR 24 HOURS, THEN HERE AS OF YESTERDAY.
WHAT, OUT OF ALL OF THAT, AND I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS, WHAT'S BEEN YOUR FAVORITE? I MEAN, WHAT-- WHAT'S BEEN THE ONE WHERE YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF LIKE YEAH, THIS HAS BEEN WORTH THE WHOLE FLYING AROUND?
IT IS A CLOSE, YOU ARE A CLOSE SECOND.
Jon: TO, TO?
FLYING A HELICOPTER.
Jon: YOU FLEW A HELICOPTER?
YEAH WE WERE FLYING A HELICOPTER, WE LANDED IN SAO PAOLO AND THEY SAID THE TRAFFIC IS TOO BAD, HERE YOU NEED TO GET IN A HELICOPTER. AND I WAS LIKE DUDE I AIN'T GONNA ARGUE WITH THAT. SO I GOT IN THE HELICOPTER AND I SAID SHOTGUN AND I WENT UP THE FRONT AND WE GOT UP OVER THE AIRPORT AND AS WE WERE FLYING OUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE APPROACHING SAO PAULO HE GOES WOULD YOU LIKE TO FLY THE HELICOPTER AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND I THOUGHT HE WAS JOKING AND HE JUST TOOK HIS HANDS OFF THE JOYSTICK. THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS.
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
AND THE CONTROL STICK AND--
SO, HE PUT YOUR HAND ON THE JOYSTICK?
HE DID PUT MY HAND ON THE JOYSTICK BUT IT WAS CONSENSUAL AND I HADN'T HAD TOO MANY, I'D HAD A FEW, I HAD LIKE AN AMBIEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON THE PLANE, BUT  I WAS STILL, I WAS WITH IT, YOU KNOW.
NO, NO, NO. I GET IT. I GET IT.
I WAS WITH IT, I JUST WASN'T AWARE OF IT. SO YEAH I WAS HOLDING --
ARE THEY DIFFICULT TO FLY? DID IT SEEM LIKE AN EASY THING TO DO? DID YOU THINK TO YOURSELF OH, THIS PILOT IS INSANE?
I DID THINK THE PILOT WAS INSANE BUT I THOUGHT, I LIKE THAT KIND OF CRAZY. SO, I WAS HOLDING THE JOYSTICK AND I THOUGHT THIS IS DOABLE. THIS IS FINE AND THEN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT-- SO I TOOK MY HANDS OFF IT. HE [BLEEP] AND HE TOOK BACK-- BUT TWO DAYS LATER FLYING OUT OF SAO PAOLO WE GOT THE SAME HELICOPTER PILOT AND FOR WHATEVER REASON, HE'S A VERY BRAZE MAN, HE LET ME DO IT AGAIN.
Jon: HERE'S MY FAVORITE PART OF THE STORY, THAT WHEN YOU [BLEEP] IT UP, HE EXPRESSED SURPRISE. LIKE,  OH! I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ACTOR I HAVE NEVER MET DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FLY A HELICOPTER.
THIS PROFESSIONAL PRETENDER
THIS PROFESSIONAL PRETENDER.
A PROFESISONAL LIAR --
HE'S AN X-MEN AND I LET HIM FLY A HELICOPTER. APPARENTLY DOESN'T DO IT VERY WELL.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT, MAN. THIS IS THE ONE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, I LIKE THEM ALL, BUT THIS IS THE ONE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO.
THANK YOU.
X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST IT'S IN THE THEATRES ON FRIDAY, IT'S JAMES MCAVOY.
THANKS MAN.
