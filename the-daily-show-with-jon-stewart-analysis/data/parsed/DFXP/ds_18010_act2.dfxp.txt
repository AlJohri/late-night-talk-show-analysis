PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA BE ON ON  THIS VERY PROGRAM TO DEBATE ME. BUT AS EXCITING AS THAT WILL BE  TO INTERVIEW A SITTING PRESIDENT  IN THE STUDIO HERE IS RAY SHOW  WHERE WE COULDN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN  ROUGHER -- REFERRING, OF COURSE  TO THE HERMAN CAIN PRESIDENCY. IN OCTOBER OF 2011 HERMAN CAIN  LED THE POLLS FOR THE REPUBLICAN  NOMINATION. TRAGICALLY AMERICA WAS DENIED A  HERMAN CAIN PRESIDENCY BUT  RECENTLY I SAT DOWN WITH MR. CAIN FOR A SERIES OF  CONVERSATIONS TO EXPLORE SOME OF  THE TOUGH DECISIONS HE WOULD  HAVE FACED IN OFFICE. I PRESENT TO YOU HERMAN CAIN, AN  AMERICAN PRESIDENCY. TONIGHT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT AMERICA  IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO  CRITICS, SIR, WHO SAY THAT  AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE  GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD? CRITICS LIKE HISTORIAN AND  ECONOMISTS.
MY RESPONSE WOULD BE ON WHAT  BASIS DO THEY MAKE THAT  ASSERTION.
ON THE BASIS OF FACTS AND  FIGURES.
I WOULD HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  FACTS AND FIGURES BECAUSE  NUMBERS DON'T LIE. BUT SOMETIMES LIARS USE NUMBERS.
SIR, WHERE IN YOUR BODY DO  YOU FEEL THAT AMERICA IS THE  GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD?
RIGHT HERE. NOT IN THERE, NO. NO. BECAUSE WHAT IS IN YOUR HEAD CAN  BE MISLEADING.
THE CRISIS --
OKAY, MR. PRESIDENT, 48 HOURS  AGO A MAN IN INDIA BROKE THE  CHICKEN WING EATING WORLD RECORD AS WE SPEAK AN AMERICAN HERO  CALLED DWAYNE IS TRYING TO BREAK  THAT RECORD. HE HAS EATING 32 WINGS. -- 322 WINGS. HE HAS THREE MINUTES LEFT AND HE  IS THINKING ABOUT GIVING UP. YOU NEED TO INSPIRE HIM AND IN  DOING SO INSPIRE AMERICA. THREE, TWO, ONE --
DWAYNE, MAN UP! AND REMEMBER THESE WORDS. IF YOU THINK YOU CAN'T, YOU  WON'T. IF YOU THINK YOU DARE NOT, YOU  DON'T. IF YOU LIKE TO WIN THIS CHICKEN  WING EATING CONTEST BUT THINK  YOU CAN'T, THEN CHANCES ARE YOU  WON'T. LIFE'S BATTLES DON'T ALWAYS GO  TO THE FASTEST, THE BIGGEST, OR  THE STRONGEST CHICKEN WING  EATER. I BELIEVE IN YOU DWAYNE. LOANT LET AMERICA DOWN.
GOOD NEWS. HE IS FEROCIOUSLY EATING WINGS  AGAIN. THERE'S A DOCTOR ON SITE WHO  SAYS IF HE CONTINUES HIS STOMACH  MAY EXPLODE.
STAND DOWN, DOCTOR, AND  THAT'S AN ORDER FROM THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.
NEXT TIME ON HERMAN CAIN AN  AMERICAN PRESIDENCY. DIPLOMACY?
AMERICA WILL NOT
