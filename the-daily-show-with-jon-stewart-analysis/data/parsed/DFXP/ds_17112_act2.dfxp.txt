(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: OF ALL BARACK OBAMA'S 2008 CAMPAIGN PROMISES, ONE REMAINS CONSPICUOUSLY UNDO.pcN  HIS PLEDGE TO CLOSE THE INFAMOUS PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY. THAT'S ACTUALLY SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. THAT'S MAGNETO. THAT'S... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S... OH, WAIT, THAT'S A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE PRESIDENT... THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO. GITMO. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA FIRST TOOK OFFICE IT SEEMED LIKE CLOSING GITMO WOULD BE A PRIORITY. HE EVEN MADE IT A SUBJECT OF ONE OF HIS FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDERS. LONG STORY SHORT, CONGRESS PUSHED OUT AND WE'RE KEEPING PRISONERS IN CUBA TO KEEP  AMERICANS SAFE BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY ANYBODY COULD EVER GET TO AMERICA FROM CUBA. (LAUGHTER) WELL, ANYBODY SIX AND UNDER COULD NEVER GET HERE. IF ONLY SOMEONE WOULD GET DOWN THERE AND REPORT ON THIS STRANGE PRISON LIMBO.
REPORTS TONIGHT ON ALL THE THINGS WE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR.
Jon: HMM?
A CONTROVERSIAL HEAVILY GUARDED SOCCER FIELD, PRICE TAG $7 50,000. ALSO ENRICHING YOUR LIFE CLASSES WHERE DETAINEE CANS LEARN TO PAINT, WRITE A RESUME, EVEN  HANDLE PERSONAL FINANCES.
Jon: A RESUME? (LAUGHTER) THAT SEEMS OPTIMISTIC.
21 CABLE T.V. CHANNELS. D.V.D. MOVIES, NEWSPAPERS AND A LIBRARY. THEY'VE GOT 13,000 BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY HERE, ALL KINDS OF BOOKS  EVEN "HARRY POTTER" IN RUSSIAN AND ARABIC.
Jon: OOH, I WONDER IF THEY HAVE "HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN" WHERE  INMATES ARE KEPT IN A CREEPY OCEAN-BOUND PRISON IN A STATE OF LIMBO UNTIL THEY EVENTUALLY  GO... OH, OKAY. THEY'VE PROBABLY SEEN THAT ONE. (LAUGHTER) I GET IT, OBAMA CAN'T MAKE THE MORAL CASE FOR REPUBLICANS  CLOSING GUANTANAMO SO HE'S TRYING TO MAKE THE TEA PARTY FINANCIAL CASE.
HI, JON, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: WAIT, I KNOW THAT VOICE.
HEY, EVERYBODY!
Jon: HEY, IT'S GITMO! OUR FAVORITE GUANTANAMO DETAINEE.
HI, JON!
Jon: YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS. YOU LOOK LIKE A FABBRIo|ox JAY MUPPET.T-(LAUGHTER) OR AN OLD SCHOOL ISLAMIC RAPPER. IS THAT A MS. PAC-MANAMA SHEEN?
YEAH! COST U.S. TAXPAYER A LOT OF MONEY! GITMO LOVE PLAYING WITH PAC-MAN. GET CHASED BY WOMEN IN BURKAS! (LAUGHTER) THE REMIND GITMO OF GITMOS WIVES BACK HOME! (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: GITMO, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THOSE ARE GHOSTS, NOT...
HUH? GITMO'S WIVES DEAD? WAAAH! GITMO HATE AMERICA! GITMO GET REVENGE. (ULULATING) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NO, THEY'RE GHOSTS IN THE GAME GITMO. THOSE AREN'T BURKAS. I'M SURE YOUR WIFES ARE FINE.
OH. WELL GITMO STILL GET REVENGE.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO THAT?
GET AMERICA DRUNK IN PRISON, PAYING TO TAKE CARE OF GITMO AND FRIENDS.
Jon: GITMO! I HARDLY THINK YOU CAN...
ONE SECOND, JON, TIME FOR GITMO TO ORDER GITMO'S LUNCH. HOLD ON. (LAUGHTER) HOLD ON, LET ME SEE WHAT WE GOT. (LAUGHTER) GITMO HAVE LOBSTER... MAKE THAT TWO. BABY BACK RIBS AND A MOJITO.
Jon: WAIT, I THOUGHT PORK AND ALCOHOL WERE AGAINST YOUR RELIGION.
THEY ARE. BUT REVENGE ISN'T! (ULULATING)
Jon: THANK YOU, GITMO. GITMO, EV
