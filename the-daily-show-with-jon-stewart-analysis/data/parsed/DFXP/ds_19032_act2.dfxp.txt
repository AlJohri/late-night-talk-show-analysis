[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THOSE OF YOU OUTSIDE THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK ON JANUARY 1 BILL DEBLASIO BECOMES THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK WHICH MEANS MICHAEL BLOOMBERG GETS ONE MORE NEW YEAR'S EVE AS MAYOR AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND HE'S GOING ALL OUT THIS NEW YEAR'S EVE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHAT WILL -- [  APPLAUSE  ] SURPRISINGLY GOOD SHAPE. WHAT WILL LIFE BE LIKE IN NEW YORK WITHOUT A BILLIONAIRE IN CHARGE. FOR MORE WE GO TO THE RESIDENT DERANGED MILLIONAIRE MR. JOHN HODGMAN. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.
THANK YOU.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AND NOW GOODBYE.
Jon: WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHAT?
I'M LEAVING NEW YORK FOREVER, JOHN, WHEN I HEARD THAT THIS SIX JFOOT FIVE LIBERAL FAIR HOUSINGX SANDINISTA YETI WOULD SOON BE SET LOOSE IN MY CITY, I REALIZED A DERANGED MILLIONAIRE IS NOIZED LONGER WELCOME.
Jon: THIS IS GOODBYE THEN.
I'LL ALL RIGHT I'LL STAY.. ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM.  AFTER EVERYTHING THE WEALTHY HAVE DONE FOR YOU MAYOR BLOOMBERG UNDERSTANDS.
IF WE COULD GET EVERY BILLIONAIRE AROUND HERE IT WOULD BE A GODSEND. THEY WOULD PAY A LOT OF TAXES, SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN THE STORES AND RESTAURANTS AND CREATE A BIG CHUNK OF OUR ECONOMY AND WE TAKE TAX REVENUES FROM THOSE PEOPLE TO HELP PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REST OF SPECTRUM.
WE BILLIONAIRES ARE NEW YORK CITY. WHEREAS NEW YORK IS YANKEE STADIUM WITH THE BEST SEATS BOUGHT UP BY BANKERS WHO DON'T EVEN USE THEM. NEW YORK IS THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. CLOSED FOR A PRIVATE EVENT.
Jon: THAT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE OF HURRICANE SANDY.
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT INVITED.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE EVENT?
I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS A SECRET SEX PARTY WITH MASKS. I DON'T KNOW WHO I WAS HAVING SEX WITH A WOMAN WHO LOOKED LIKE SUMNER REDSTONE WITH A MASK ON THE POINT IS HE IS GOING TO TURN THIS CITY INTO A LIVING HELL.
Jon: HE'S NOT. ALL HE IS DOING IS ADDING A HALF PERCENT TAX INCREASE ON WEALTHIER RESIDENTS FOR PRE-K. W
PRECISELY. A LIVING HELL.. MARK MY WORDS, IN THE FUTURE THIS CITY WILL BE A DILAPIDATED WASTELAND WITH NEW YORKERS TRAVELING UNDERGROUND PACKED TOGETHER IN URINE SCENTED SUBTERRANEAN SEWAGE TROLLEYS AND LINE UP TO EAT WET TUBES OF MEAT DISPENSED FROM SOVIET ERA METAL CARTS. EW.
Jon: I THINK YOU ARE DESCRIBING HOW MOST PEOPLE IN NEW YORK LIVE RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT ABOUT CRIME, JON? ARE YOU READY TO GO BACK TO RUNNING IN FEAR OF GANGS WEARING RUNROLLER SKATES AND BASEBALLING UNIFORMS?
Jon: THAT'S FOOTAGE FROM THE WARRIORS. THE DOCUMENTARY THE WARRIORS BY KEN BURNS.
Jon: I'M SURPRISED YOU ARE NOT HAPPIER THAT NANNY STATE BLOOMBERG IS LEAVING WITH ALL HIS LAWS ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN SMOKE AND WHAT SODA YOU CAN BUY. JON I'M A MILLIONAIRE. THOSE LAWS ARE FOR YOU PEOPLE. I DRINK BIG SODA AND SMOKE WHERE I WANT. I'M A RICH PERSON. HERE I AM AT THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.
Jon: YOU ARE INSIDE --
I'M A DONOR I CAN PET THE TAXIDERMY.
Jon: THAT'S A MATERNITY WARD. I WAS HANDING OUT CIGARS TO BABIES. HERE I AM SEEING HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVE.
Jon: THAT'S MY HOUSE.
I COME AND GO AS I PLEASE. YOU ARE OUT OF WHOLE MILK, Q-TIPS, HALF A FROZEN TURKEY AND YOU HAVE TO REPLACE YOUR PILLOW CASES.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU DO?
A PRIVATE EVENT WITH MASKS. THE PARTY IS OVER. I'M LEAVING FOR BRIGHTER SHORES SINGAPORE IS LETTING US HUNT THE HOMELESS. UNLESS NEW YORK WOULD LIKE TO WOO US BACK. MAY A SUGGEST A COUNTER OFFER.
Jon: FROM YOUR QUILLED BIC PEN. THIS ALSO SAYS HUNT THE HOMELESS.
I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH WE WANT TO HUNT HOMELESS.
Jon: THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
FAREWELL OR SHALL I SAY DUBAI. THAT'S HOW BILLIONAIRES SAY DUBAI. DUBAI!
