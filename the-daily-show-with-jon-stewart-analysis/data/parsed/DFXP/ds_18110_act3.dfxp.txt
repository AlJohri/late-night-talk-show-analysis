Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY  GLES TONIGHT, THE ANCHOR AND  MANAGING EDITOR OF NBC NIGHTLY NEWS PLEASE WELCOME  BACK TO THIS PROGRAM, BRIAN  WILLIAMS! SIR! HOW ARE YOU?
FINE, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. JON, I COME HERE TONIGHT,  THE HOUR IS LATE, THE WEEK  GROWS LATE. I COME HERE TONIGHT IN  SOMETHING OF AN  INTERVENTION. I COME HERE TONIGHT ON  BEHALF OF THESE PEOPLE AND  THE PEOPLE WHO WATCH YOU  EVERY NIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, DON'T GO, JON.
OH.
NO.
YOU'RE GOING LEAVE US  WITH THIS OLVER TWIST GUY.
NO, NO, NO, NO. HE'S --
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HIM  WHEN HE TALKS.
NO.
EFLY COCKNEYED ACCENT.
HERE'S THE THING.
COTTON TOPS AND.
HE WRITES AND PRODUCES  THE SHOW, THEY JUST SPELL IT  OUT FOR ME FON ETICALLY ON THE MONITOR.
THERE IS NOTHING GOOD  ABOUT THIS.
HE'S GOING GIVE YOU A  SENSE OF SHAKESPEARIAN  ELEGANCE TO THIS PROGRAM. HE'S GOING TO LEND CLASS AND  STYLE. YOU KNOW, 20 MINUTES INTO  THE SHOW, HE'S GOING TO  SERVE TEA, 20 MINUTES INTO  THE SHOW. TEA AND CRUMPETS FOR THE  ENTIRE AUDIENCE.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,  THREE MONTHS. I MEANS THAT'S A LOT OF NICK  AT NIGHT.
HERE'S WHAT IS SO  INTERESTING. THIS HAS TURNED NEW SOME  RESPECTS, AND I DON'T SAY  THIS WITHOUT ANY AFFECTION,  IN SOME RESPECTS IT HAS TURNED YOU INTO AN OLD  JEWISH MAN.
WELL.
THE INFLECTION, DID YOU  ONE OF THESE, I MEAN WHY. IT'S A LOT OF NICK AT  KNIGHT. YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE JERSEY  SHORE YET THIS YEAR? I WAS THERE THIS WEEKEND. IT'S COMING BACK, BABY, THE  JERSEY SHORE. THEY'VE REBUILT IT AS FAST  AS, I MEAN IT WAS EVEN OVER  THE TWO WEEK THAT I WAS  THERE PREVIOUSLY THEY HAVE THROWN UP BUILDINGS THAT I  NEVER NEW EXISTED BEFORE.
SOMEPLACES ARE IN FOR A  ROUGH GO BETWEEN WHERE YOU  GUYS HAVE A PLACE AND WHERE WE HAVE A PLACE AND WHERE WE  MEET FOR ICE CREAM,  SOMEPLACES ARE GOING TO I  HAVE A ROUGH G THERE IS ONE TOWN, LOST 152 HOMES. AND THEN SOUTH OF THAT,  ORTLEY BEACH, NORMANDY BEACH,  THESE FOLKS.
THEY GOT CRUSHED.
BUT ALL THOSE AREAS.
WHERE I GREW UP, SEA  BRITE WAS OUR HOME.
MAX'S HOT DOGS.
MAXES OR THE WINDMILL,  GOT TO BE FAIR. BUT I AM A SORRY. BUT THERE ARE --
MAXES.
THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD  ORGANIZATIONS.
LET'S SETTLE IT.
IT'S MAXES.
NO, IT'S MAXES FOR ME BUT  THE WINDMILL AS A  FAMILY-OWNED INSTITUTION, I THINK WE HAVE TO BE PROPER  ABOUT IT. LIKE I'M A HUFFMAN'S ICE  CREAM GUY, YOU TOOK TO US A  DIFFERENT PLACE.
I'M JUST-- I JUST AM  LACTOSE INTOLERANT.
I KNEW WE WERE GOING  THERE.
HEY, SPEAKING OF THE  PRESIDENT, LET ME ASK YOU  THIS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF TALK,  THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE  CRACKING DOWN ON  PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION, DO YOU THINK THEY'RE READING  YOUR E-MAILS BECAUSE I HAVE  E-MAILED YOU AND SAID OH, PHILLY THINGS, DO YOU THINK  THERE IS SOMEONE AT DOJ WHO  IS DOING ONE OF THESE.
I HOPE SO.
OH, WOW, MY EYES ARE  BLEEDING.
I HOPE SO THERE WERE SOME  GUYS OUTSIDE WANTING TO TALK  TO YOU WHEN WE'RE OVER HERE. NO, I, THIS IS-- YOU KNOW,  LEAKS ARE ACTUALLY A BIG  PART OF AND LATELY HAVE BEEN OF OUR DEMOCRACY. LEAKS ARE HOW WE HAVE  LEARNED ABOUT-- A LOT OF  STORIES.
EXACTLY.
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST  TEN YEARS IN THE WAR ON  TERRORISM. SO I THINK WE WILL FIND OUR  WAY. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS IN A  ROUGH SPOT OVER THIS. AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE  PRESIDENT.
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT IT  WAS-- THERE'S ALL THESE  SCANDALS. THERE'S NOTHING LITERALLY TO  CONNECT THE WHITE HOUSE AS  THOUGH THERE IS COORDINATION  INVOLVED. BUT THESE ARE CERTAINLY WERE  REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE FOR  FIVE YEARS DESPERATELY  THROWN THEIR POOP AT THE WALL TO TRY AND GET  SOMETHING TO STICK TO THIS  GUY. THESE ARE TWO THINGS THAT  ARE WORTHY OF SCRUTINY, NO?
I THINK BETWEEN BENGHAZI,  THE IRS AND NOW THIS, THIS  IS IN PART WHAT HAPPENS TO SECOND TERMS. WE WATCHED THIS WITH BILL  CLINTON, REMEMBER. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN  HIS SECOND TERM BETWEEN  MONICA LEWINSKY AND  WHITEWATER. SEE THIS IS-- .
Jon: BUT SEE THIS S I  DON'T LIKE TO GROUP THESE  THINGS INTO DIFFERENT  THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, BENGHAZI, THAT  IS A SITUATION, THEY ISSUED  AN ARB ON THAT AND THINK SHOWED THAT THE STATE  DEPARTMENT WAS TRULY LACKING  THROUGHOUT ITS COMMUNICATION AND ALL THAT, THAT IS A  SEPARATE THING. THE IRS TARGETING SPECIFIC  GROUPS THAT NEEDS TO BE  ADDRESSED. IF THAT WAS DRIVEN BY THE  WHITE HOUSE WHICH IT DOESN'T  SEEM TO IN ANY WAY BE  CONNECTED TO THEM T IS STILL SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE  ADDRESSED. BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE, CRIMINALIZING  JOURNALISM, I THIS SI AN  ENORMOUS, THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT ALL LEAKS ARE CREATED  EQUAL. BUT HAVE THEY EVER LISTED A  REPORTER AS A COCONSPIRATOR  IN A CRIMINAL CASE.
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW ALL  I CAN SAY IS WE WILL KNOW  MORE. WE WILL HAVE HEARD FROM THE  ATTORNEY GENERAL. I THINK THIS IS THE WEEK. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET  A LITTLE MORE TRANSPARENT.
WERE YOU IN ON THE  MEETING WHERE IT WAS OFF THE  RECORD, WAS ANYBODY FROM  NBC.
OUR ORGANIZATION WAS,  YES.
WHAT DID THEY SAY? FIRST OF ALL WE BELIEVED IT  WAS --
THIS IS OFF THE RECORD.
WE BELIEVED IT WAS  BENEFICIAL AND NET-NET THAT  IT WAS BETTER TO GO THAN NOT TO GO.
Jon: WHAT DID THEY SERVE  WATCH. DOW SERVE FOR THAT KIND OF  THING, HAVE SOME CAKE.
I'M A LIAR! HOW DID IT GO?
I'LL ONLY SAY THIS. IT'S BEEN UNUSUAL TO BE IN A  WAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR  ON TERRORISM. I HAVE SEEN THE END EFFECT  OF A DRONE. I HAVE WATCHED IT CARRIED  OUT ON A LIVE TELEVISION. I HAVE SEEN THE FILE  BUILDING, THE TARGET  ACQUISITION.
I WATCH HOMELAND.
IT IS A RARE THING. AND THAT'S THE OTHER END OF  THIS.
BUT NO, BUT THEY LEAK  WHEN IT'S TO THEIR  ADVANTAGE.
OF COURSE THEY DO.
AND THEY ALLOW THAT TO GO  THROUGH. BUT WHEN IT IS TO THEIR  DISADVANTAGE THEY HAVE BEEN  VERY DRACONIAN.
WHEN THEY ARGUE NATIONAL  SECURITY THEY DO IT WITH THE  AUTHORITY OF, WELL, YOU'VE  SEEN.
SURE. >
YEAH.
WE'RE TO THE GOING TO END  THERE. WE JUST CAN'T. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT  SOMETHING HAPPY. THREE MONTHS, REALLY?
MAN! YEAH.
ARE YOU GOING TO COME,  YOU SHOULD COME OVER.
DON'T YOU WANT TO DIRECT.
I DON'T WANT TO DIRECT.
THREE MONTHS SAY LONG  TIME, I'M JUST SPEAKING ON  BEHALF OF THOSE OF US THAT LOVER YOU.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS, AND  I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. I WILL MISS THE PEOPLE MORE  THAN THE PEOPLE WILL MISS  ME. THAT SAUL MI GOING SAY.
NO, I DOUBT THAT VERY,  VERY HIGHLY.
LET ME SAY THIS. WHEN I AM THERE-- SKETS EL  DOWN. I SAW THAT. IN LIFE, IN GENERAL, PEOPLE  DO NOT APPLAUD FOR YOU. LIKE WHEN I'M IN THE MIDDLE  EAST AND GI INTO A  RESTAURANT, PEOPLE ARE GOING  TO GO HE GOT THE FALL AVEL SO THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE  GETTING ITS LOVE THAT I GET  FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK, 22  MINUTES A NIGHT HERE ON VIACOM'S COMEDY CENTRAL  PROPERTY, ALSO WITH  WORKAHOLICS IN-- AND "THE  COLBERT REPORT," I WILL BE OVER THERE --
YEAH.
I DON'T REGARD YOU AS  MIKEY THE MARKETER YOU BUT  THAT WAS REALLY A SUCK UP JOB OF MASSIVE PROPORTION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND THAT WAS WONDERFUL  ILLITERATION.
JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE  GIVING YOU THREE MONTHS OFF,  JUST SAYING GOOD-BYE, HERE'S OLVER TWIST WITH THE NEWS,  GREAT, FANTASTIC. GREAT, WE'RE GOING DO MARY  POPPINS FOR THREE MONTHS  WHILE YOU'RE OVER BEING KRES IL B DEMILL.
