ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE BACK, WE'RE TALKING WITH SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN. HERE IS WHERE I THINK IT GETS INTERESTING. SO THE IDEAL IS FAIRNESS. IDEOLOGICALLY, AT LEAST PRINCIPLED CONSISTENCY, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE CONSTITUENT PRESSURE THAT CAN'T BE IGNORED. YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE BATTLE YOU'RE FIGHTING, SO LET'S SAY IT'S THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX FOR OBAMACARE. THEY HAVE THIS IN PLACE, IT'S A 2 TO 3% TAX ON MEDICAL DEVICES TO HELP PAY FOR OBAMACARE. NOW, YOU ARE FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
I AM.
THEY ARE THE SECOND LARGEST SELLER OF THESE MEDICAL DEVICES.
UH-HUH.
SO YOU VOTED AGAINST TAKING THAT TAX OUT. THAT SEEMS ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD STAND FOR, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE THAT CONSTITUENCY.
SO LOOK, THE QUESTION ON THE MEDICAL DEVICE TAX FOR ME, I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO TAX MANUFACTURING EXTRA OF ANY KIND BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PRODUCE MORE MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT OUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO PAY FOR IT, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS TO KEEP THE BUDGET GOING. YOU'VE HIT ON A KEY PART ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON WORKS RIGHT NOW, WHEN WASHINGTON ACTUALLY WORKS AND WHEN IT DOESN'T. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE POINT IF WE CAN FOR JUST A SECOND ABOUT COLLEGE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THIS SO WELL.
YEAH YEAH YEAH.
BUT WE CAN DO IT AROUND ANY PART OF THIS. WHEN I GREW UP MY MOM WORKED A MINIMUM WAGE JOB AT SEARS. MY DAD SOLD CARPETS ENDED UP AS A MAINTENANCE MAN.
RIGHT.
I MADE IT TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT I WENT TO A COMMUTER COLLEGE THAT COST $50 A SEMESTER. AND I WENT TO A COLLEGE THAT COST $50 A SEMESTER AND GOT A GOOD EDUCATION BECAUSE I GREW UP IN AN AMERICA THAT SAID OUR JOB IS TO INVEST IN OUR KIDS. AND TO HELP THEM BUILD A FUTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED. IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE, IT REALLY IS A RIGGED GAME. AND IT'S SET UP NOW OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
AND IT'S PROBABLY ALWAYS BEEN.
WELL, NOT LIKE THIS.
RIGHT.
IT'S SET UP OVER AND OVER AND OVER THAT THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POWERFUL MORE POWERFUL. THEY'VE GOT ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF CONCENTRATED MONEY AND CONCENTRATED POWER. ALL WE GOT ON THE OTHER SIDE IS WE'VE GOT OUR VOICES AROUND WE GET OUR VOTES. IF WE GET OUT THERE AROUND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THEM. [APPLAUSE]
I TELL YOU, GOOD ON YOU FOR BELIEVING IT AND GETTING INTO THE FIGHT AND DOING WHAT YOU CAN WITHIN THAT AND DEALING WITH OBVIOUSLY ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPLICATIONS THAT OCCUR WITH IT. A FIGHTING CHANCE -- DID YOU DO THE AUDIO BOOK?
I DID IT ALL. IT'S ME.
REALLY YOU DID THE READING?
I DID. I WROTE THAT BOOK AND I READ THE AUDIO.
WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN GOOD TO HAVE WILLFORD BRIMLEY IN THERE? A LITTLE WILLFORD BRIMLEY IN THERE?
A LITTLE BIT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE.
YOU KNOW A FIGHTING CHANCE IS ALL YOU NEED.
I'M GOING TO GET IN AND LISTEN TO IT IN MY CAR THAT I KEEP INSIDE MY PRIVATE PLANE. "A FIGHTING CHANCE", IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. ELIZABETH WARREN.
