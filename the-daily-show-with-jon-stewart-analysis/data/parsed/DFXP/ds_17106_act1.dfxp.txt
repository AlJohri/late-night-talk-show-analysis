Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TON, JIM PARSONS, STAR OF THE BIG BANG THEORY AND THE  NEW BROADWAY SHOW HAR VEHICLE A SHOW ABOUT AN INVISIBLE RABBIT THAT KILLS  AND EATS HARVEY WEINSTEIN. (LAUGHTER) I GOT TO TELL YOU THOUGH, MANMENT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN NEW YORK CITY MAN, BUT IT HOT AND-- IN NEW YORK CITY. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, I'M GOING TO JUST TAKE A SIP OF A COMICALLY OVERSIZED MOVIE  THEATRE BEVERAGE, IT'S SO HOT.
IT COULD BE THE END OF THE BIG GULP, NEW YORK CITY MAYOR BLOOMBERG WANTS TO BAN  THE SALE OF ALL SUGARY DRINKS THAT ARE LARGER THAN 16 OUNCES. HE WANTS THE BAN AT ALL NEW YORK RESTAURANTS, MOVIE THEATRES, SPORTS ARENAS AND MORE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) SORRY, WHAT? YOU ARE GOING TO BAN-- NO!
THEY CAN STILL SELL 32 OUNCE OF SUGAR DRINK TO YOU BUT THEY HAVE TO PUT IT IN  TWO CONTAINERS. WE'RE NOT TAKING WAY ANYBODY'S RIGHT TO DO THINGS, WE'RE SIMPLY FORCING YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION  TO GO FROM ONE CUP TO ANOTHER CUP. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MR. MAYOR WORKS THESE GIANT CUPS WHERE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE GOING TO TO-- [BLEEP] (APPLAUSE)
Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO TELL THEM TO TAKE TWO SMALLER [BLEEP] BECAUSE I'M NOT. WOW. WOW. WOW, MAYOR BLOOMBERG. WOW. I LOVE THIS IDEA, YOU HAVE OF BANNING SODAS LARGER THAN 16 OUNCES. IT COMBINES THE DRACONIAN GOVERNMENT OVERREACH PEOPLE LOVE WITH THE PROBABLE LACK  OF RESULTS THEY EXPECT. (LAUGHTER) WHAT ARE YOU DOING! WE ALREADY LET YOU MAKE UP A THIRD TERM AS MAYOR. PUT CAMERAS ON EVERY INTERSECTION AND FOR SOME REASON PICNIC TABLES IN THE  MIDDLE OF 7th AVENUE, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT. THIS IS ALL WE HAVE LEFT. THIS IS ALL WE HAVE. YOU REALIZE THE POSITION YOU PERSONALLY PUT ME IN, MR. MAYOR. WATCH THIS!
NO ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU OUGHT TO DRINK NINE MOUNTAIN DEWS A DAY BUT YOU  OUGHT TO HAVE THE CHOICE AS AN ADULT TO MAKE THOSE DECISION FORCE YOURSELF.
RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I AGREE WITH HIM. (APPLAUSE) I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT, MICHAEL BLOCKBERG. STILL THE LARGER POINT REMAIN, THE SODA BAN SAY TERRIBLE IDEA. NOBODY IS GOING TO BE DOWN WITH IT.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. TO ANYONE THINKS YOUR KIDS SHOULD DRINK THIS ENTIRE THING.
NO.
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY.
NO, YOU SOLVE OBESITY, HEALTH CARE, IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
Jon: MORNING JOE? YOU'RE SPONSORED BY STARBUCKS. YOU REALIZE YOUR PERSONAL SPONSOR OF BEVERAGES ARE PRETTY MUCH INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE  BAEFERJS YOU WANT OUTLAWED. LADY, PLEASE, STEP AWAY FROM THE BEVERAGE, LADY, STEP AWAY MI ALL FOR PROMOTING  PUBLIC HEALTH BUT MR. MAYOR, THIS PLAN MAKES YOUR ASSININIE LOOK BIG. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHTMENT AS A KNOCKER I CAN GO ON MY LUNCH BREAK TO, I DON'T KNOW, CARNEGIE DELI AND ORDER 14 POUNDS OF PASTRAMI GARNISHED WITH 7 POUNDS OF BEEF TONGUE  AND NOT ON WON'T THE DELI GUY GO WHAT? THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE THING A PERSON COULD EVER ORDER. THE DELI GUY WILL GO OH, YOU WANT THE MANDY PATNEKI, S. AND IF I WANT TO SPLIT THE THIS THIS SAND WATCH WITH SOMEONE IT'S AN EXTRA THREE BUCKS. BY THE WAY, THE MEAT DOES COME WITH TWO PIECES OF RYE BREAD, BECAUSE KNOW, IT'S A SANDWICH. IT'S MORE LIKE EATING A COW WITH A RYE BREAD YALMAKLE. THEN GI TO RIGHT OVER TO HOOTERS FOR A QUICK BASKET OF CHICKEN WINGS BATTERED  DEEP FRIED AND TOSSED IN HOT SAUCE AND MELTED BUTTER SERVED WITH A BOWL OF CHEESE, TOP IT ALL OFF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE FROM SERENDIPITY, ALL OF  THIS IS LEGAL IN NEW YORK CITY! UNTIL GOD FORBID, I WANT A WASH IT DOWN WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING AS PURE AND  REFRESHING AS MOUNTAIN DEW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AH, OH NO, I'M ON THE RUN FROM JOHNNY LAW! (LAUGHTER)  [BLEEP] THIS IS LEGAL UNTIL IT MELTS. AND WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT SLURPEES? WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT SLURPEES, HUH? A DRINK THAT LIVES IN THE NETHER WORLD BETWIXT PHYSICAL STATES. IS IT A SOLID, A LIQUID, ULTIMATELY A GAS? OH, BUT THAT'S RIGHT THE SLURPEE IS FINE BECAUSE THEY'RE SOLD IN CONVENIENCE  STORES AND THAT'S NOT REGULATED BECAUSE-- IT'S MAGIC. LOOK, MR. MAYOR, I KNOW YOU CAN BE INTIMIDATED BY THESE LARGE SIZE DRINKSMENT YOU  AND RI BOTH, LET'S FACE IT, SMALL. WE MIGHT SEE A GENEROUSLY PROPORTIONED SUGARED BEVERAGE AND THINK OF IT AS A DROWNING HAZARD. (LAUGHTER) BUT IT'S NOT FAIR! IT'S NOT FAIR! MR. MOON BLOOMBERG, FOR PEOPLE LIKE US, WE, THE WEE PEOPLE WHOSE THIRST ASK BE  STATED BY A MERE THIMBLE CUP OF JUICE OR THE DEW FROM AN ELM LEAF--  (LAUGHTER)  BUT YOU AND I MUST COEXIST IN A CITY THAT ALSO INCLUDES PEOPLE LIKE 7 FOOT 1 INCH  KNICKS CENTER TYSON CHANDLER. A 16 OUNCE SODA FOR HIM IS LIKE AN EYE DROP NEVER A BABY BIRD'S MOUTH. SURE F WE WERE NURSING HIM BACK TO HEALTH IN A SHOE BOX THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH. AND BY THE WAY, YOU MAYORS ARE THE ONE WAS GOT US IN THIS OBESITY MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. REMEMBER NEW YORK IN THE 70s. TIMES SQUARE, STRIP CLUBS, PIMPS, HOOKER, SLASHERS, SMACK ADDICTSING DRUG DEALERS. YOU NAME IT, WE HAD THEM AND LOOK AT US, WE LOOKED GREAT! SO IS A VELT. AND THEN MAYOR GIULIANI HAD TO CLEAN THE PLACE UP. WELL, GUESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO IN AND REPLACE STRIP CLUBS AND PORN  THEATRES WITH THE BUBBA GUMP SHRIMP COMPANY, THE UNLIMITED BREAD STICK MECCA  KNOWN AS THE OLIVE GARDEN AND MY FAVORITE ONE, THE M & M STORE. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHY THE [BLEEP] IS THERE A STORE THAT SELLS NOTHING BUT M & Ms. THIS IS NEW YORK, YOU CAN BUY M & Ms IN ANY STORE. WHY DOW NEED A STORE THAT IS ALL JUST M AMP Ms. AND I WANT TO OPEN BE ALL TODAY WORLD ON 34s AND 88. MR. MAYOR, PICK YOUR POISON. OBESITY IS THE PROBLEM NOW? FINE, I THINK I KNOW HOW TO SOLVE IT. REINTRODUCE CRACK. IT MAY BE WHACK, BUT WHEN THAT WEIGHT COMES OFF, IT STAYS OFF. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
