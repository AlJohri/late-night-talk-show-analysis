Jon: MY GUST TONIGHT WAS THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS FROM 2006 TO 2013. PLEASE WELCOME HAMID AL-BAYATI. SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL, THANK YOU MUCH FOR JOINING US. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE BECAUSE ON AMERICAN TELEVISION, THERE ARE A LOT OF TALKING HEADS SAYING, "WHAT'S GOING ON IN IRAQ?" BUT WE DON'T... BOY, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS, KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] YOU PERHAPS MIGHT KNOW MORE. SO WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT'S GOING ON THERE RIGHT NOW?
JON, DEFINITELY I KNOW MORE THAN MOST OF THE AMERICANS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: KIND OF GOES WITHOUT SAYING. I FIGURED THAT. ALL RIGHT. SO HIT ME. HIT ME. WHAT HAPPENED?
THE IRAQ I WAS BORN IN AND GROWN UP IN IS AN IRAQ OF UNITY. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LOVE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND HARMONY. MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, JEWS, THEY LIVED FOR CENTURIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE MINORITIES, FAR EXTREMISTS, AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY MAKE HIGH NOISES, LOUDER NOISES, AND THE MEDIA PICK UP THESE NOISES AND MAKE IT BIGGER. NOW, THERE'S THE FACT THAT THERE IS SPILL OVER FROM INSTABILITY IN SYRIA. ISIS IS AL QAEDA IN IRAQ AND SYRIA IN THE BEGINNING. THEN AL QAEDA CONSIDERED THEM TOO EXTREME AND THEY --
Jon: AL QAEDA CONSIDERS THIS ISIS GROUP...
TOO EXTREME FOR THEM. IMAGINE, YOU KNOW?
JON: SO AL QAEDA, THE GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR 9/11, THEY SEE THESE GUYS AND THEY GO, NO, I CAN'T WORK WITH THEM. [LAUGHTER]
EXACTLY. THEY'RE TOO MUCH. SO NOW WE ARE FACING THIS GROUP WHO ARE BRUTAL. THE UNITED NATIONS REPORTS THAT THEY ARE COMMITTING WAR CRIMES. THEY EXECUTE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING CIVILIANS, IN MOSUL AND OTHER AREAS.
Jon: BUT LET ME ASK YOU, SO, THE REPORTS THAT WE GET IS, SO WE LEAVE IRAQ. EVERYBODY SAYS IRAQ IS READY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNANCE AND SECURITY OF THIS NATION. YOU WERE THERE DURING THAT TIME. YOU FELT GOOD ABOUT THAT ARRANGEMENT. EVERYBODY FELT GOOD. THESE GUYS ROLL IN, AND THE IRAQI ARMY SEEMS TO DISPERSE, AND THEY TAKE OVER THIS AREA IN MOSUL. AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'VE NOW JOINED UP WITH THE ORIGINAL BA'ATHISTS FROM SADDAM'S OLD GROUP, AND THEY SEEM TO BE ALLIED NOW. IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
YES, NOT ONLY ISIS. ISIS IS 5,000 TO 6,000 PERSONNEL.
Jon: 5,000 TO 6,000.
ONLY, ONLY.
Jon: SERIOUSLY, THAT'S IT?
YEAH. THE HIGHEST ESTIMATION IS 10,000, HOWEVER, THE BA'ATH PARTY IS HEADED OR LED BY IZZAT AL-DOURI WHO WAS VICE PRESIDENT FOR SADDAM. THE INSURGENCY GROUP LIKE NAQSHABANDI GROUP AND OTHER GROUPS ARE JOINING.
Jon: SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE ANBAR PROVINCE IN 2006?
YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE IRAQI ARMY WAS NOT WELL EQUIPPED. WE ASKED FOR, FOR EXAMPLE, JET FIGHTERS. WE DIDN'T RECEIVE THEM YET. THE CONGRESS APPROVED F-16s SINCE MANY YEARS. WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THEM. NOW WE ASKED, THIS IS WHY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT OFFICIALLY REQUESTED AN AIR STRIKE BY AMERICAN FORCES. NOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY COULD TAKE CERTAIN TARGETS, PRECISE ATTACKS WHENEVER THEY FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GATHER TOGETHER TO FIGHT THIS EXTREME GROUP.
Jon: SO YOU WOULD LIKE US TO JOIN THE FIGHT?
I WOULD SAY THIS IS THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT REQUEST.
Jon: THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE US TO JOIN THE FIGHT?
YES, THEY REQUEST AMERICAN AIR STRIKES, NOT JUST IN TROOPS, GROUND TROOPS, THAT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONLY AMERICANS AND DRONES AND YEMEN AND PAKISTAN AND OTHER AREAS.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT, YOU WOULD LIKE OUR DRONE PROGRAM. WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT PACKAGES. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?  [LAUGHTER] SO LET ME SEE, LET ME GET YOUR ORDER RIGHT.
OKAY. OKAY.
Jon: THE AMERICANS WOULD... I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN SORT OF A VERY STRANGE POSITION IN THAT WE DID DESTABILIZE YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME. [LAUGHTER] I THINK AMERICANS FEEL LIKE WE HAD SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY, A LOT OF BLOOD FOR REASONS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE CAN FIGHT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS RIGHT TO GO IN OR NOT, BUT THAT MAYBE WE DO HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE AFTER DOING THAT, BUT OUR ABILITY TO WITHSTAND SORT OF BEING THE FABRIC THAT HOLDS THE COUNTRY TOGETHER FROM THESE SECTARIAN VIOLENCE ISSUES AND THESE EXTREMIST VIOLENCE ISSUES, IS NOT A TENABLE POSITION FOR US TO BE IN.
WELL, THERE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI. AND BY THE WAY...
ZARQAWI WAS THE OLD LEADER OF THIS GROUP. THE JORDANIAN THAT WAS KILLED A WHILE AGO.
YES. ISIS WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF THE ZARQAWI GROUP WHO WAS SEPARATE FROM AL QAEDA. ZARQAWI WROTE A LETTER TO OSAMA BIN LADEN WHEN HE ANNOUNCED ALLEGIANCE TO HIM, SAYING THAT IF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT GETS STRONGER AND CONTROL THE SITUATION, THERE WILL BE NO OPTION BUT TO PACK AND LEAVE AS WE DID IN AFGHANISTAN. THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO BRING SECTARIAN WAR BETWEEN SUNNIS AND SHIA. THIS IS WHY...
Jon: SO THEY'RE FOMENTING THIS WAR. THEY WANT THIS LARGER SECTARIAN WAR.
YES. ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI WHOSE REAL NAME IS IBRAHIM AWWAD AL-BADRI, HE TRIED TO PLAY THAT SECTARIAN CARD.
Jon: HE WANTS TO FOMENT THIS WAR. WELL, LET'S DO THIS. LET'S TAKE BREAK. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FAR LITTLE BIT?
YES. BECAUSE WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE COME BACK IS, WOULD HE BE ABLE TO ENFLAME THAT SECTARIAN WAR IF THE AL-MALIKI GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN MORE OPEN TO POWER SHARING WITH THE SUNNI MINORITY AND HAS THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS. SO WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. WE'LL HAVE MORE WITH HAMID AL-BAYATI RIGHT AFTER THIS.
