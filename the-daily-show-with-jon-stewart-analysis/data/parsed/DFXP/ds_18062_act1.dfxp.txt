FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL ["THE COLBERT REPORT" THEME  MUSIC["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] DHAWZ. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY NICE PROGRAM FOR  YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST AMBASSADOR TO TO UNITED TO THE  UNITED NATIONS SUSAN RICE IS  HERE. WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT HER ON  THE PROGRAM BUT PERHAPS IT'S A  VALENTINE'S WISH. WANT TO GIVE A QUICK SHOUT OUT  TO THE LOVERS OUT THERE SOME OF  WHOM ARE CLEARLY LYING. ALL THE LOVERS THAT THOUGHT IT  MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE  THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER ON THE CRUISE FOR THE HOLIDAY AND ENDED  UP STRANDED AT SEA SPENDING SIX  DAYS CRAPPING INTO A PLASTIC BAG OR AS THE GERMANS CALL THAT, THE  LOVE BOAT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CNN HAS BEEN ON THE CASE FOR  SOME REASON GIVING THIS BOAT  CRISIS WALL TO (bleep) COVERED WALL COVERAGE TREATING A STALLED  CRUISE SHIP LIKE IT'S THE  SHACKLETON EXPEDITION.
IT'S A GREAT MOMENT TO  VISUALLY CONNECT YOU TO THE  DAUGHTER YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IN SEVEN DAYS.
Jon: YEAH, YOU ARE NOT  HEROS, GUYS. IT'S NOT A HOSTAGE SITUATION OR  A BABY IN A WELL. YOU RECONNECTED THEM. THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE  EACH OTHER. SHE'S ON A CRUISE FOR A FEW  DAYS. [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE, THE SHIP OF STOOL  ENJOYS 24/7 COVERAGE AND A SLOW  TUG JOB BACK TO MOBILE, ALABAMA, WHILE OTHER STORIES REMAIN  REMARKABLY UNDER THE RADAR.
HEADS OF STATE AND LEADERS  FROM 57 ISLAMIC COUNTRIES  EXCLUDING SYRIA ARE IN THE TWO DAY CAPITAL FOR THE MEETING.
Jon: INTERESTING BUT ARE  THEY (bleep) IN BAGS? IF THEY ARE NOT -- I SEE IT'S  THE OIC. NOT AS CATCHY AS ISLAMAPALOOZA  BUT IT WILL DO. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE YOU GETTING THAT? ALL RIGHT. THE OIC LED BY SECRETARY GENERAL  EKMELEDDIN IHSANOGLU OR AS HIS  FRIENDS CALL HIM -- YEAH. THEY SAY HOW WALKING OFF PRIVATE  PLAN PLANES IS FOR CHUMPS. CHECK THAT BAD BOY OUT. ESCALATORS OUT OF PLANES. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU  THINK THAT'S COOL? NOBODY OUTLAZIES AMERICA. THAT'S HOW YOU GET OFF A PLANE  IN THE MUSLIM WORLD. GUESS HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET OFF  PLANES FROM NOW ON? WHAT IS UP BITCHES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT IS UP, BITCHES. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FOR MIDDLE EAST WATCHERS,  THE BIGGEST NEWS WAS THE  PARTICIPATION OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD  THE FIRST TIME AN IRANIAN HEAD  OF STATE VISITED EGYPT IN MORE THAN 30 YEARS.
FOR MORP THAN THREE DECADES  THEY STAYED AWAY. MANY EXPECT A CORDIAL  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRAN AND  EGYPT BUT NOT ONE WHERE THEY ARE BEST FRIENDS.
Jon: THEY ARE NOT GOING TO  BE BESTIES. FRIEND OF A FRIEND LIKE A  FRIEND'S COLLEGE ROOMMATE. YOU ARE COOL WITH EACH OTHER  EXCEPT YOU LIKE THE EAGLE AND HE  LIKE THE GIANTS EXCEPT REPLACE THE EAGLES WITH YOU BELIEVE IN  THE HOLOCAUST -- BLESS YOU  WIKIPEDIA. NOT EVERYONE IN EGYPT FEELS THE  SAME WAY WITH THE IRANIAN  LEADER.
A PROTESTER THREW HIS SHOE AT  AHMADINEJAD.
THE SHOE DIDN'T CONNECT. IT HIT A SECURITY GUARD.
THAT SECURITY GUARD, IT HAS  BEEN REPORTED NOW HAS ATHLETE'S  FACE. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, I IMAGINE THAT  THROWING YOUR SHOE AT A LEADER  IS NOT AN EASY CRIME TO GET AWAY  WITH. WHO THREW THAT? AHHH -- [LAUGHTER] CLEARLY THIS CONFERENCE DESERVES  THE ATTENTION, IF NOT THE WORLD,  AT LEAST BASIC CABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO JOHN OLIVER SAT DOWN WITH IOC  GENERAL IHSANOGLU TO LEARN MOW.
YESTERDAY I HAD THE  OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE  SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OIC, THE MAN WHO HAS THE EAR OF EVERY  HEAD OF STATE IN THE ISLAMIC  WORLD AND BEYOND. WHAT PAY CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND  THE SUBTLE INTERCASEYS OF ENTIRE  MUSLIM WORLD. CONGRATULATIONS OF YOUR RECENT  SUMMIT.
THANK YOU. IT WENT VERY WELL.
YOU SERVE AS THE VOICE OF  ISLAMIC COUNTRIES.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S BY THE VIRTUE OF THE  CHARTER.
WHAT DOES THAT VOICE SOUND  LIKE? DOES IT SOUND LIKE AHH I'M GOING  TO (bleep) KILL YOU. AHHH. I'M GOING TO KILL YOUR FAMILY? ARRGH? BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY THAT IS HOW  IT REQUEST COME ACROSS TO US. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, THE VOICE WHICH YOU  KINDLY IMITATED IS A VOICE OF  MARGINAL GROUPS BUT THE VOICE OF MASSES, THE VOICE OF ONE AND A  HALF MILLION PEOPLE IS THE VOICE  OF MODERATION.
IT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME  OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR AMERICA'S  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MUSLIM WORLD AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO  START THAN WITH BRUTAL HONESTY. HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH AMERICA  AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. OKAY? WE TRIED EVERYTHING. WE TRIED SPECIAL ENVOYS. WE'VE TRIED INTERVENTIONS, WE'VE  TRIED WARS. WE'VE TRIED GIVING YOU MONEY,  NOT GIVING YOU MONEY. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND  WHAT THE ISLAMIC WORLD WANTS  FROM AMERICA. IT'S LITERALLY NEVER OCCURRED TO  US TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION  BEFORE.
TAKE THE PROBLEM OF  TERRORISM. IF YOU THINK THAT KILLING  TERRORISTS ARE THE SOLUTION TO  SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM, THEY  THEN WE ARE THE PROBLEM.
THAT MIGHT BE WHAT WE THINK.
WHEN YOU KILL ONE TERRORIST  YOU BREED TEN TERRORISTS.
RIGHT SOMETIMES IT FEELS A  BIT LIKE WHACK A MOLE. YOU WHACK ONE ANOTHER ONE TURNS  UP SOMEWHERE ELSE. THEY ARE IN IRAQ, WHACK, NOW  THEY ARE IN SYRIA, WHACK. NOW THEY ARE IN MALLEY. WHERE IS MALI?
THERE'S A NEED TO HAVE A  COMPREHENSIVE OUTLOOK AND TO  DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS AND THE SHORT HISTORY OF USING THE  WRONGS AGAINST TERRORISTS. THERE'S BEEN CERTAIN MEASURED  MISTAKES BY KILLING INNOCENT  CIVILIAN PEOPLE.
PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE DRONES  THEN?
YOU HAVE TO CARE FOR THE  LEGAL ETHICS, IT'S NOT ONLY THAT  YOUR PUSHING YOUR OWN NATIONAL  INTERESTS.
IT'S CLEAR HUMAN RIGHTS  INFRACTION AND IT HAS TO STOP.
SO NO DRONES. OF COURSE. EVERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP HAS TO  BE BASED ON AN ABILITY TO LISTEN  TO ONE ANOTHER.
THIS IS WHERE WE AS OIC ARE  TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE WHOLE  WORLD THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OPEN COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS TO  UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.
OKAY, SO THIS IS A PEACE  PILLOW. OKAY? NOW, WHENEVER SOMEBODY IS  HOLDING THIS IT'S A SAFE SPACE  AND THEY GET TO SAY WHAT THEY LIKE ABOUT THE OTHER CULTURE. OKAY. I'LL GO FIRST. WE SOMETIMES FIND YOU  FRUSTRATING BECAUSE SOMETIMES  YOU BLAME US FOR THINGS THAT HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND  YOU'VE GOT LONG MEMORIES AND YOU  REMEMBER TOO MANY THINGS. OKAY, SO NOW YOU GO.
WELL, I THINK THE MUSLIM  WORLD IS FRUSTRATED SOMETIMES  WITH THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE  PROBLEMS OF THE MUSLIM WORLD. THE IMAGE OF THE UNITED STATES  INVADING IRAQ, ININVITEDDING  AFGHANISTAN, ET CETERA.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
I WANT TO MAKE REFERENCE TO  TWO THINGS. IN THE FIRST WHEN PRESIDENT  OBAMA WAS FIRST INTEGRATED I  PROBABLY --
OKAY, OKAY.
I HAVE THE PILLOW, PLEASE  ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE BEST IDEAS AND  EXPECTATIONS AND WE HOPE THAT  THE PRESIDENT IS --
YOU CAN BE VERY ANNOYING  BECAUSE WE FIND IT HARD TO READ  YOU AND YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO US AS WELL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT  DOESN'T HAPPEN MUCH. AFTER HOURS OF INTENSE  DISCUSSION FINALLY A  BREAKTHROUGH. WE FOUND THE ONE AREA THAT WOULD  FIX IFERG INSTANTLY.
ONE IMPORTANT IDEA. THIS IS THE ISSUE OF MUSLIM  WORLD. THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE NEED IT'S  BE SOLVED. THIS IS REALLY THE MOST  SENSITIVE ISSUE THAT NEEDS THE  CARE OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
THAT IS GREAT. SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO BUILD A  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ISLAMIC  WORLD IS SOLVE THE ARAB ISRAELI  CONFLICT.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR  CONTRIBUTION.
WE HAD DONE IT AND NOW TOLL  SEAL OUR HISTORIC AGREEMENT IN  THE TRADITIONAL MANNER AND THEN  BANG. BANG, UP TOP. POUND IT OUT. AND BLOW IT UP.
THANK YOU.
MAYBE NOT THE UM, OTHERWISE  WE'RE GOOD. HASEL TOF.
MY PLEASURE.
Jon: JOHN
