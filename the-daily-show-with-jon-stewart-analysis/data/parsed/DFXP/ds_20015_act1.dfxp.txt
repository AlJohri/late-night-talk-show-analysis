FROM AUSTIN, TEXAS, THE ONLY STATE WHERE GUNS CAN RUN FOR OFFICE, IT'S THE "DAILY SHOW'S" COVERAGE OF DEMOCALYPSE 2014: SOUTH BY SOUTH MESS. OPEN-CARRYING TO THE MIDTERMS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  HEY! WHAT UP? WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW"! WE ARE IN TEXAS!   ( CHEERS ) WE'RE IN TEXAS AT AUSTIN'S OWN ZACH THEATER, THE THIRD OF THE FOUR SHOWS WE'RE DOING DOWN HERE, UNLESS YOU COUNT OF COURSE LAST NIGHT'S STAFF KARAOKE PERFORMANCE ON SOUTH CONGRESS, WHICH-- ( LAUGHTER ) I'VE NEVER BEEN SO MOVED BY THE SONG FROM "ALADDIN." OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE PHENOMENAL MOVIE "BOYHOOD," ELLAR COLTRANE, HOMETOWN BOY, IS GOING TO BE ON THE SHOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, ONE THING THAT'S FOR SURE HERE IS WE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL THIS WEEK ABOUT TEXAS, AND THE ISSUES THAT CONCERN THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS, PROMINENT, AMONGST THEM, OF COURSE, IMMIGRATION -- MORE SPECIFICALLY, STOPPING IT. WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE, STARTING WITH JASON JONES. HE'S AT THE MEXICAN BORDER. JASON, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
JON, I AM ACTUALLILY WHERE THE REAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS IS THE AUSTIN BORDER.   ( CHEERS )
Jon: I'M SORRY? AUSTIN'S BORDER WITH MEXICO? BECAUSE --
NO, NO, NO, AUSTIN'S BORDER WITH EVERYWHERE ELSE. THE HUMAN INFLUX INTO THIS CITY IS OUT OF CONTROL AND THE LOCALS ARE ( BLEEP ) PISSED!
Jon:  NO, LISTEN TO ME. THERE IS A LOT OF GROWTH, THOUGH, IN THIS AREA, THE PEOPLE COMING HERE HIGHLY SKILLED.
OH, RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, KNOWING HOW TO STEAM PUNK CARTOON CHARACTERS. REAL SKILLS. YEAH. JON, IT'S GETTING TOO DAMN CROWDED. THIS MORNING I GOT STUCK FOR 45 MINUTES IN THE NORTHBOUND JOGGING LANE.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, WELL LET'S GO OUT TO SAMANTHA BEE. SHE IS COVERING TEXAS' NOTORIOUS RIVER CROSSING. SHE'S AT THE RIO GRANDE. SHE'S AT THE RIO GRANDE RIGHT NOW. SAM BEE.
ACTUALLY I'M ON AUSTIN'S COLORADO RIVER. WELL "RIVER" IS ACTUALLY BEING GENEROUS. IT'S MORE LIKE AUSTIN'S ORGANIC BRAMBLE AND ALGAE PUDDLE FARM, WHERE THOUSANDS OF DREAMERS RISK BLISTERS AND A FARMER'S TAN AS THEY PADDLEBOARD THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM. IN THE HOPE THAT ONE DAY THEY CAN LIVE THE DREAM WORKING ON COMMISSION IN A VINTAGE TACO SHOP. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  SAM, IF I MAY, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO EAT VINTAGE TACOS?
OH, MY GOD, JON. YOU DON'T EAT THEM. THAT RUINS THE VALUE.
Jon:  OH, I'M SORRY.
JON, JON, THEY CAN DO THAT BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM. JON, THE LOCAL AUSTINITES ARE SO MAD. THEY'RE MAD AS HELL. ONE NATIVE TOTAL ME-- AND I QUOTE-- "THIS IS NOT THE AUSTIN I GREW UP IN... WHEN I MOVED HERE TWO YEARS AGO." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: ALRIGHT. YOU KNOW, I GOTTA TELL YOU, I KIND OF KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN. I GOT HERE SUNDAY, AND IT HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE THEN.
JON! YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE SATURDAY! MUCH BETTER TIMES.
Jon:  I UNDERSTAND. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT RIGHT NOW TO JESSICA WILLIAMS. SHE IS DOWNTOWN IN AUSTIN. JESSICA.
YES, HI, JON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HI, JON. I'M HERE AT THE AUSTIN BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, WHERE THEY'RE COORDINATING WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A TOP-SECRET STING OPERATION TO END THIS IMMIGRATION NIGHTMARE.
Jon: THAT'S, OKAY, ANOTHER TOP SECRET, I GOT THAT. LET'S HEAR THE DETAILS.
JON, I'M TOLD AUSTIN OFFICIALS WILL BE PLACING AN AD ON CRAIGSLIST, SEEKING A KEYTAR UKELELE PLAYER TO JOIN A JAPANESE LANGUAGE LANA DEL RAY COVER BAND.
Jon:  THAT SOUNDS KIND OF--
MAINSTREAM FOR AUSTIN? DUDE, I KNOW. THEY'RE TRYING TO CAST A REALLY WIDE NET, AND AS SOON AS THEY SHOW UP TO THE AUDITION, BOOM! THEY'RE DEPORTED BACK TO WHATEVER GODFORSAKEN SUBURB THEY CAME FROM. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JON-- IT'S THE FIRST PHASE OF THE CITY'S NEWEST POPULATION CONTROL INITIATIVE DUBBED SOUTH BY GET THE ( BLEEP ) OUT OF HERE. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS, SAMANTHA BEE, JASON JONES. BUT YOU KNOW, HONESTLY, THE CROWD REALLY DOES SEEM HOSTILE TO-- PEOPLE COMING HERE. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WRITE SOMETHING, YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO HIT A NERVE. BUT-- BOY, THAT'S A ( BLEEP ) ROOT CANAL WE HIT ON THAT ONE. THAT'S FOR REAL. BUT LISTEN-- ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AUSTIN'S POPULATION GROWTH ISN'T THE ONLY ONE CONCERNING TEXANS. AL MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS ON EVERYONE'S MINDS, AND THE INCREASING POPULATION OF LATINOS HAS PLENTY OF WHITE AMERICANS CONCERNED. I SAT DOWN WITH FOUR OF THOSE EXTREMELY PASSIONATE CITIZENS.
IF YOU LOOK AROUND, THERE'S A THE LOT OF HISPANIC PEOPLE. I MEAN, NOT THAT THERE'S-- I'M NOT RACIST OR ANYTHING, BUT  IMMIGRANTS KEEP POPULATING. WE MIGHT HAVE TWO KIDS. WHAT DO THEY HAVE, FOUR, FIVE KIDS?
I'M SAYING SEVEN, EIGHT.
YEAH, MAYBE.
NINE.
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED I WAS LATINO.
ALL CULTURES ARE NOT EQUAL.  I LIVE IN KOREA TOWN, DEAR.
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOUR PROBLEM IS KOREANS?
NO, KOREANS ARE FINE. BUT, SEE, KOREANS ARE DIFFERENT. KOREANS ARE LIKE CHINESE. YOU DON'T SEE PROBLEMS WITH THE CHINESE IMMIGRANTS, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ILLEGAL.
IS IT GETTING HOT IN HERE? I'M STARTING TO SWEAT THROUGH MY SHIRT. LATINOS ARE WORSETHAN BOTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE, THAT'S A FACT. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS LIKE RICHARD JONES KNOW HOW TO STOP THIS ILLEGAL MENACE.
AND I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THAT THE SOLUTION IS TO ROUND EVERYBODY UP.
NO, THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO ROUND THEM ALL UP. THE SOLUTION IS TO WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE STUFF THAT THEY'VE GOT HERE-- FREE STUFF.
WHAT FREE STUFF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE FREE STUFF. YOU GET-- YOU GET A COMPUTER WHEN YOU COME HERE.
WHAT KIND OF COMPUTER? ARE WE TALKING A NEW COMPUTER, LIKE A DELL, GATEWAY TYPE OF THING.
NEW COMPUTERS. THEY GET NEW COMPUTERS. THEY GET THEIR CAR PAYMENTS. THEY GET THEIR HOUSE PAYMENTS. THEY GET FREE MEDICAL CARE.
WHERE?
THEY GET IT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
NO, BUT SPECIFICALLY, WHERE. I WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME FREE COMPUTERS AND SOME FREE MEDICAL CARE.
YOU HAVE TO COME HERE ILLEGALLY TO GET THE FREE STUFF.
( BLEEP )
IT'S WELFARE AT ITS WORST.
I WANTED TO TALK TO THESE MEXICAN MOOCHERS, AND LUCKILY I WAS IN A PLACE WITH A LOT OF THEM -- TEXAS, A STATE WHERE LATINOS WILL OUTNUMBER EVERYONE BY 2020, WHICH MADE IT REALLY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER A PANEL OF LATINO IMMIGRANTS.
I MYSELF AM FROM EL PASO, TEXAS.
YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE A TEXAN.
YEAH.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. SHOW OF HANDS, HOW MANY OF YOU PEOPLE ARE FROM TEXAS? ♪ THE STARS AT NIGHT ARE BIG AND BRIGHT ♪♪
♪ DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS ♪
CLEARLY, YOU LOOK LATINO BUT YOU'RE REALLY CLAIMING THAT YOU'RE TEXANS.
I WAS BORN IN TEXAS BUT MY HERITAGE IS MEXICAN.
WHAT? DAMN IT, THESE WERE THE WRONG TYPES OF LATINOS. I NEED THE ILLEGALS WITH THE FREE COMPUTERS. SO I WENT DEEP UNDERCOVER, EDWARD JAMES OLMOS STYLE. HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING FREE BENEFITS FROM UNITED STATES?
NEVER. I WORK HERE VERY HARD. I NEVER RECEIVED NOTHING.
YOU GET FREE THINGS AND YOU KNOW IT.
NO.
WHEN DID YOU COME TO AMERICA? JESUS, ONE SECOND. HOW DO YOU TURN THIS THING DOWN? JESUS. JESUS, SERIOUSLY, HOW DO YOU TURN THIS THING DOWN?
HIT THE LEFT SWITCH, MAN.
WHAT'S UP FELLAS? YOU DRESS PRETTY NICE FOR LANDSCAPERS.
LANDSCAPERS? I MANAGE MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS.
I WORK IN A LAW FIRM BUT CAN YOU PLEASE NOT TALK LIKE THAT?
LIKE WHAT?
THE WAY YOU'RE TALKING.
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE SUCH A DICK?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BRO. THIS IS HOW THE LATINOS DRESS.
MAYBE IN 1992.
WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) BRO.  ( BLEEP ) OFF ESE. BUT DON'T LET THESE SEEMINGLY NICE PEOPLE FOOL YOU.
THE ILLEGALS THAT COME INTO THIS COUNTRY, THEIRS IS TO COME IN AND TAKE AND NOT PAY THE TAXES AND THAT'S NOT THE AMERICAN DREAM.
WHO EXACTLY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
THEY'RE NOT WEALTHY PEOPLE SNEAKING ACROSS THE BORDER.
NOT WEALTHY AT ALL.
NO, YOU CAN'T JUST COME ACROSS ON THEIR OWN. THEY CALL THEM, THEY'RE MULES AND IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO PAY, THEY'LL ABUSE YOU ALONG THE WAY.
THAT SOUNDS EXHAUSTING.
VERY EXHAUSTING.
SO THEY HAVE THEM ALL HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THESE GROUPS?
YES.
WHY? WHAT ARE THEY YEARNING FOR?
TO FEEL FREE. >>SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE ARE TIRED, POOR, HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING FOR FREEDOM. THAT'S NOT WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING AT ALL. JUST GET BEHIND THE LINE. THAT'S HOW WE KEEP IT THIS BEAUTIFUL AND A GREAT COUNTRY.
BUT FOR HOW LONG BECAUSE THE MENACE IS ALREADY HERE.
THEY'RE ALREADY IN YOUR STATE. YOUR TOWN. MAYBE EVEN YOUR STREET.
AAGGHHHH!
AND THEY'RE CALLED LATINOS.
YOU GOT DINNER.
BOSTON MARKET!
WATCH OUT. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL THEY GET WHAT THEY CAME FOR. ( LAUGHTER ).
NICE CATCH!
A LIFE AS BORING AS YOURS. AND THEY ARE PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING TO GET IT.
DON'T FORGET THE BOCA BURGERS FOR GRACIE.
YOU GOT IT, BABY.
AND WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN AND THEIR BACKS ARE AGAINST THE WALL, THEY'LL MAKE THE BEST ( BLEEP ) SALSA YOU'VE EVER HAD. SO WAKE UP, AMERICA. THE LATINOS AREN'T COMING. THEY'RE ALREADY HERE. LATINOS.
Jon:  AL MADRIGAL, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
