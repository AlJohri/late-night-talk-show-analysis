Jon: WELCOME BACK. BY NOW WE ALL KNOW THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS SPYING ON US. THEY'RE IN OUR PHONES, OUR E-MAILS, OUR TUMBLRS, THE GRINDERS, THE TWITTERS, THE WHITAKERS -- THAT'S AN APP THAT TELLS YOU WHERE FOREST WHITAKER IS AT ALL TIMES. YOU'RE NOT SAFE ANYMORE ANYWHERE, OR TO PARAPHRASE A CERTAIN SAGE PHILOSOPHER... ♪ I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME ♪♪ THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, "SOMEBODY IS WATCHING ME." BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT "BIG BROTHER" ANYMORE, BIG EMPLOYER IS GETTING IN ON THE GAME.
THE NEW SPYING SCANDAL THIS MORNING, THOUGH, NOT SOME GOVERNMENT AGENCY. NO, AT IKEA. THE FURNITURE COMPANY STANDS ACCUSED OF SPYING ON EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS IN FRANCE.
Jon: FRANCE! NOT JUST IKEA, FRENCH IKEA, A PLACE THAT COMBINES THE CHAOS AND FRUSTRATION OF IKEA AND COMBINES IT WITH FRANCE. [LAUGHTER] SO HERE'S THE DEAL: THERE'S NO WAY IKEA HAS BEEN SPYING ON THEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IF THEY DID, THEY WOULD KNOW THAT IKEA HAS A TERRIBLE FELINE INFESTATION. [LAUGHTER] I'M BEING TOLD THAT'S JUST AN AD FOR THEIR NEW LINE OF CAT URINE SCENTED FURNITURE. SO WHAT ARE THESE LINGONBERRY SLINGERS TRYING TO FIND OUT?
IKEA MAY HAVE USED INFORMATION TO QUELL WORKPLACE GRIEVANCES.
Jon: THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST HUMILIATING PLACES TO BE FIRED FROM. MONSIEUR BERNARD, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN STEALING FLA�RDFULLS, SO PACK UP YOUR THINGS AND GET OFF THE DAGSTORP AND DON'T LET THE BILLY-OLSBO HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT, ANY OF THE FINE BILLY PRODUCTS. WE LOOKED AT THE THING AND THE DOORS ARE CALLED BILLIES. IT'S FUNNY THAT THIS WAS GOING ON AT IKEA OF ALL PLACES BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SELL AN ITEM THAT SHIELDS YOU FROM BEING SPIED ON. IT'S CALLED THE INGEN SPY. I'M JUST GOING TO ORDER IT RIGHT NOW. I'M JUST GOING TO ORDER IT UP. WOW. THAT WAS FAST. THEY YOU SO MUCH, SIR. VERY KIND OF YOU, SIR. NO, YOU. THANK YOU, SIR. NO, REALLY. THANK YOU. WELL, I'LL JUST SEE WHAT YOU GOT HERE. WE'LL PUT THIS TOGETHER. VERY NICE. ALAN WRENCH.
IKKKKEEEAAAA!!!!
