FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MICHAEL LEWIS IS GONNA BE JOINING US WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HIGH FREQUENCY TRADINGING ON WALL STREET AND JUST HOW MISUNDERSTOOD AND INCREDIBLY FAIR IT REALLY IS AND HOW IT AND IT ALONE IS WORKING TO MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR YOU AND ME. [ LAUGHTER ] (bleep). BUT FIRST IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MALAYSIAN FLIGHT 370. THREE WEEKS FILLED WITH DISPAIR AND ANGER FOR THE FAMILIES. CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION FOR THE INVESTIGATORS AND RATINGS FOR CNN. YES, IN THESE THREE WEEKS CNN HAS BEEN MUCH LIKE OUR NATIVE ANCESTORS USING EVERY PART OF THE TRAGEDY. [LAUGHTER] WITH NON-STOP BREAKING NEWS REENACTMENT, EXPERT PANEL GRAPHIC SIMULATION, WITH JUST A SOUCIANT OF POP CULTURE RELEVANCE.
THERE'S ONE THEORY OUT THERE WITH A CHILLING SO-CALLED ZOMBIE PLANE THEORY.
Jon: BECAUSE ZOMBIES ARE HOT, YO! OR MAYBE THE PLANE WAS COOKING METH IN A NEW MEXICO TRAILER. [LAUGHTER] BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW DID THE PLANE MEET YOUR MOTHER? [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS WHILE OTHER NEWS NETWORKS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT WILLING TO MOVE ON TO OTHER NEWS CNN HAS STEADFASTLY REMAINED ON THE RAMPART OCCASIONALLY POINTING AT (bleep) AND WONDERING WHAT IT IS.
COULD THEY BE CLOSE TO FINALLY FIND A SCRAP, A SCRAP OF DEBRIS.
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE DEBRIS FIELD FROM AN AIRPLANE CRASH. IT MAY NOT BE BUT IT HAS THE SIGNATURE LOOK OF IT.
PERHAPS IT REALLY WASN'T THE DEBRIS WE THOUGHT IT WAS.
BREAKING NEWS, A THAI SATELLITE SPOTS 300 OBJECTS.
PIECES OF DEBRIS WHETHER THEY ARE FROM THE PLANE OR NOT WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW.
THE OCEAN IS ALSO FILLED WITH A LOT OF TRASH. SO IT'S HARD TO TELL ONE THING FROM ANOTHER.
POSSIBLE DEBRIS SPOTTED. THE SEARCH MOVES 700 MILES NORTHEAST.
COULD THAT BE A PIECE OF THE MISSING PLANE?
SOME OBJECTS FLOATING IN THE WATER. NO WORD YET ON WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE.
ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN RETRIEVED AND LOOKED AT IN ONE OF THESE SHIPS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE NOT CONNECTED TO 370.
ANOTHER DAY. NO CONFIRMED PLANE DEBRIS. [LAUGHTER]
BASICALLY CNN HAS BECOME THIS GUY. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH, I GOT SOMETHING. I GOT BREAKING NEWS. I GOT BREAKING NEWS. HOLD ON I THINK I FOUND BLACKBEARD'S TREASURE ALRIGHT IT'S JUST A POP TOP. SORRY. AFTER THREE WEEKS OF NON-STOP COVERAGE, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?
WE'RE GETTING A LESSON IN THE TRASH, ALL OF THE TRASH AND ALL OF THE OBJECTS FLOATING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.
WHO KNEW THE OCEAN WAS SUCH A BIG MESS? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YEAH, WHO KNEW THE PLACE WHERE WE DUMP A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUR TRASH -- [LAUGHTER] -- IS FILLED WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUR TRASH? [LAUGHTER] WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN YOU FLUSH THE TOILET? [LAUGHTER] WHERE DOES IT GO? POOP HEAVEN? SO THE OCEANS ARE SOMEWHAT POLLUTED. GIVE US ANOTHER SCOOP!
WEIGH IN ON HOW -- WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH GARBAGE AND HOW IT SETTLES.
TRADITIONAL FORMS OF MARINE DEBRIS LIKE BUOYANT PLASTICS MOST COMMON OUT IN THE OCEAN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE DO FLOAT. HEAVIER MATERIALS DENSER THAN SEA WATER WILL SINK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET'S RECAP CNN'S LAST WEEK OF MISSING MALAYSIAN AIRLINER COVERAGE. THERE'S A LOT OF NONMALAYSIAN AIRLINER GARBAGE IN THE OCEAN. THE HEAVIER OF WHICH SINKS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE LIGHTER OF WHICH FLOATS -- [LAUGHTER] -- LET US GO NOW TO WOLF BLITZER IN THE NEW DUH ROOM. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] (bleep) WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO SPOT SMALL DEBRIS FIELDS FLOATING ON TOP OF GIANT OCEANS. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD AT CNN DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFICULTY OF FINDING THINGS THAT SUNK USING ONLY TRADITIONAL EYESIGHT METHODS?
FLY DOWN UNDERNEATH THE WATER HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE INDIAN OCEAN, ANYWHERE OUT HERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO DEEP THERE'S REALLY NO LIGHT WHATSOEVER, IT'S FLAT OUT DARK DOWN THERE IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS YOU CANNOT LOOK THE WAY DO YOU FROM A SHIP OR A PLANE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN S WHAT IT'S LIKE UNDER THE SEA. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO BE UP WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE, UP WHERE THEY WALK, UP WHERE THEY RUN ON WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM? LEGS. ♪ UP WHERE THEY STAY PART OF THEIR WORLD ♪ [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE ON THAT WE GO OUT TO URSULA AT THE BOTTOM OF OCEAN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. CNN HAS SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND MONEY SCOURING OUR WORLD FOR ANY SIGN OF THIS PLANE. IT'S A NOBLE GOAL IF THEY HAD DONE IT IN A REASONABLE NON-DID ALIENS MAYBE TAKE IT FASHION. THE WITH ONE PLACE THEY HAVEN'T LOOKED FOR THE PLANE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS UP THEIR OWN (bleep).
ONE OF MOST DEDICATED MEMBERS OF CNN'S TEAM DURING THE SEARCH FOR FLIGHT 370 HAS BEEN MARTIN SAVIDGE. HE HAS SPENT ALMOST A MONTH SITTING IN FLIGHT SIMULATOR IN CANADA. IT HASN'T ALWYS BEEN THE EASIEST ASSIGNMENT. SO JEANNE MOOS WENT FOR THE STORY.
Jon: THERE IT IS. WITH A LACK OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS CNN IS ABOUT TO DO A STORY COVERING THEIR COVERAGE OF THE MALAYSIAN PLANE STORY.
SOMEONE STARTED #FREEMARTINSAVIDGE. THE PHARSE WAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE SHAPE OF AN AIRPLANE. SOMEONE TWEETED BLINK THREE TIMES IF YOU ARE BEING HELD AGAINST YOUR WILL. A PUBLIC FASCINATION WITH THE PLAID SHIRTS MITCH ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE WEARING. MITCH'S PLAID SHIRT EVEN STARTED ITS OWN TWITTER ACCOUNT.
Jon: IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR TWO HOUR SPECIAL REPORT CNN PRESENTS THE SEARCH FOR THE FAKE TWITTER FEED OF THE REAL GUY FAKE SEARCHING FOR THE REAL PLANE. A CNN EXCLUSIVE CNN REPORT. I HATE TO SAY IT, CNN NEEDS A REAL DISASTER TO SAVE IT FROM THIS MANMADE ONE.
DOZENS OF AFTERSHOCKS HIT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFTER A 5.1 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE.
Jon: THERE YOU GO. NOW THAT'S A REAL THING THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
WE'RE GETTING A BIT OF INFORMATION JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE USGS THAT THE CENTER OF THE QUAKE WAS IN WESTWOOD, CALIFORNIA, 4.7 ON THE RICHTER SCALE.
Jon: BEAUTIFUL, SHORT, FACTUAL NOT FILLED WITH BASELESS SPECULATION. DOESN'T THAT FEEL RIGHT?
IS A BIGGER EARTHQUAKE ON THE WAY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: GO ON.
COULD THIS BE A SEASON OF BIG EARTHQUAKES?
PLENTY OF CONCERN THAT THE BIG ONE COULD BE NEXT.
IS THIS A SIGN OF WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE FEARED.
AN 86% CHANCE OF A MAGNITUDE 7.0 OR GREATER EARTHQUAKE HITTING CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT 30 YEARS.
THE DAMAGE AND LOSS OF LIFE IN THE HEART OF LOS ANGELES COULD BE CATASTROPHIC.
SO IF THE BIG ONE HAPPENS IT'S GOING TO POP, LITERALLY POP LOS ANGELES UP LIKE A CORK.
Jon: I MEAN TALK ABOUT A BUNCH OF UNIDENTIFIEDABLE (bleep) FLOATING IN THE OCEAN, AM I RIGHT. THAT'S ALL FROM THE ARRRGH ROOM. BACK TO YOU IN THE DUH ROOM. CNN ACTUALLY SEEMS TO BE BORED WITH THE IDEA OF REPORTING REAL THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. THEY'VE DECIDED THEY NO  LONGER WANT TO BE PIGEON HOLED IN THE NONFICTION SECTION. CNN IS NOT THE FUTURE OF NEWS. CNN IS NEWS OF THE FUTURE! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
