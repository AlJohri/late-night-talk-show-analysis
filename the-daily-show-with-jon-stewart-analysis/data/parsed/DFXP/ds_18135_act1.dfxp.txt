FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON  STEWART WHO IS SPENDING THE  SUMMER WITH A LONELY  MILLIONAIRE. SIGH WHAT YOU WILL-- HE'S MAKING  $3,000 AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO  KISS ON THE MOUTH. SO DON'T JUDGE. OUR GUEST TONIGHT STARS IN  "LOVELACE," HANK AZARIA IS WITH  US. VERY, VERY GOOD. BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH  CONGRESS.
A NEW CNN POLL SHOWS JUST HOW  FED UP WE ARE WITH CONGRESS. 77% DISAPPROVE OF HOW CONGRESS  IS HANDLING ITS JOB.
John: CONGRATULATIONS,  CONGRESS. 77%. YOU MAY BE ABOUT TO BECOME THE  ENGLISH LANGUAGE'S MOST OFFENSE  OF THE "C" WORD. ( LAUGHTER )  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AFTER ( BLEEP ). BUT, LOOK, THERE'S STILL TWO  DAYS LEFT BEFORE THE AUGUST  RECESS. THE "C" WORD COULD STILL PULL  THIS AROUND. THEY COULD PASS IMMIGRATION  REFORM. IT'S ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THE  SENATE, SO COME O"C" WORD, LET'S  DO THIS.
IMMIGRATION REFORM. THAT'S STUCK AND IT HAS A VERY  DIFFICULT ROAD OF GETTING  ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE.
John: OKAY, LET'S JUST BE  HONEST NOW-- THE HOUSE IS  CLEARLY WHERE THINGS GO TO DIE. IT'S WHERE PARENTS ARE GOING TO  START TELLING THEIR KIDS THEIR  AGING PETS WENT. "OH, NOW, FLUFFY'S FINE,  DARLING. SHE JUST GOT STUCK IN COMMITTEE  COMMITTEE."  ( LAUGHTER )  ONE CHALLENGE FACING THIS IMMIGRATION BILL IS--  ( LAUGHTER )  ONE CHALLENGE FACING THIS  IMMIGRATION BILL IS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT  THE PEOPLE THAT IT IS INTENDED  TO HELP.
THEY WILL SAY TO ME AND  OTHERS WHO WOULD DEFEND THE RULE  OF LAW, "WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE 11 MILLION. SOME OF THEM ARE  VALEDICTORIANS."  WELL, MY ANSWER TO THAT IS FOR  EVERY ONE WHO IS A VALEDICTORIAN THERE ARE ANOTHER 100 OUT THERE  THEY WAY 130 POUNDS AND HAVE  CALVES THE SIZE OF CANTALOUPES BECAUSE THEY'RE HAULING 75  POUNDS OF MARIJUANA ACROSS THE  DESERT. ( LAUGHTER ).
John: WHAT? IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN  TO UNPACK A STATEMENT LIKE THAT. FIRST, I THINK THAT IS HARD  PROOF THAT STEVE KING DOES NOT  USE DRUGS. BECAUSE-- DOES HE HAVE ANY IDEA  WHAT 75 POUNDS OF MARIJUANA  WOULD LOOK LIKE? ( LAUGHTER )  THAT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD TO  HAUL ACROSS A DESERT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IN FACT, COULD WE SEE A LITTLE  BIT MORE OF THAT PICTURE? OKAY, SO HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE  THING. BUT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BLAME  STEVE KING. THIS IS PROBABLY JUST WHAT HIS  CONSTITUENTS WANT, RIGHT?
69% OF STEVE KING'S  CONSTITUENTS IN IOWA'S FOURTH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WANT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM. 59% SUPPORT A PATHWAY TO  PERMANENT RESIDENTS FOR  UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS UNDER  THE AGE OF 15.
John: WOW! TO GO THIS HARD AGAINST YOUR OWN  CONSTITUENCY AND BASIC REASON,  YOU REALLY MUST HAVE BALLS THE SIZE OF CANTALOUPES. ( LAUGHTER )  AND UNREPRESENTATIVE KING IS NOT  ALONE IN HIS DISTRUST OF THESE  IMMIGRANTS.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY  OF THEM WHO COME HERE ILLEGALLY  COME SO ILL PREPARED FOR SUCCESS   SUCCESS. THEY COME WITH LACK OF  EDUCATION. THEY COME WITH LACK OF SKILL. THEY COME WITH LACK OF ABILITY  OR UNWILLINGNESS TO ASIMULATE  INTO THE CULTURE.
John: EXACTLY. DO WE REALLY WANT THESE TIRED,  POOR, HUDDLE MASSES IN THIS  COUNTRY? SHOW ME THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS  THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. SHOW ME THE PLACE! SHOW IT TO ME! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  OF COURSE, IN THE END, IT MAY  NOT EVEN MATTER WHAT CONGRESS DOES WITH THIS OR ANY LAW.
PILL POLITITIONS AT THE STATE  LEVEL ARE INCREASINGLY  FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT THEY SAY IS AN OVER-REACH BY THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION.
WE KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR US  HERE IN KENTUCKY, AND WE DON'T  WANT TO BE DICTATED TO BY WASHINGTON, D.C.
FOR KENTUCKY STATE SENATOR  DAMEN THAYER, THE FEDS HAVE GONE  TOO FAR.
THE LEFT WING LIBERALS IN  WASHINGTON, D.C. THINK THEY KNOW  WHAT'S BEST. THEY HUT GUNS. THEY HADE HAIGHT LAW-ABIDING  CITIZENS WHO WANT TO BUY GUNS,  AND WE FEAR THAT THERE WILL BE FEDERAL GUN LAWS THAT ACTUALLY  TAKE AWAY WHAT WE BELIEVE IS OUR  SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.
OTHER THAN THAT PREMISE BEING  COMPLETELY FALSE, WHAT MESSAGE  DID YOU SEND TO D.C.? THE SENATE PASSED A BILL THAT  WOULD HAVE NULLIFIED ANY NEW  FEDERAL GUN LAW PASSED AFTER JANUARY 1.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT  NULLIFICATION. AN AGE-OLD LEGISLATIVE TACTIC  WHERE STATES PASS SPECIFIC LAWS  EXEMPTING THEMSELVES FROM FEDERAL LAWS. IT'S A FLAWLESS POLITICAL  TECHNIQUE THAT DOZENS OF  EMBRACING, DESPITE FACT THE  SUPREME COURT MADE NULLIFICATION LAWS ILLEGAL ON SEVERAL  OCCASIONS, BUT THAT IS NOT THE  POINT.
BARACK OBAMA LOST KENTUCKY IN  A LANDSLIDE IN 2008 AND 2012. SO IF WE DISAGREE WITH THOSE  POLICIES THAT WE STATED TWICE,  WHY SHOULD OUR GOVERNOR HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND, BY  UNILATERAL FIAT, IMPLEMENT THE  MOST UNPOPULAR LAW THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS PASSED.
IF YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE  PRESIDENT, WHY SHOULD HIS  ADMINISTRATION'S LAWS APPLY IN YOUR STATE?
CORRECT.
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT'S  THE LAW.
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT  IS THE LAW. ( LAUGHTER )
BUT, APPARENTLY, SOME, LIKE  COUNTY-LEVEL KENTUCKY JUDGE  TOMMY TURNER DON'T THINK THAYER HAS THE RIGHT TO NULLIFY ANY  FEDERAL LAW.
NULLIFICATION LAW NMY  OPINION, IS NOT LEGAL. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO  IGNORE FEDERAL LAW. I MEAN, BASICALLY THEY'D BE  IGNORING THE UNITED STATES  CONSTITUTION.
SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO  DID BIT?
WE INTRODUCE AID BILL TO FULL  NIGH STATE LAWS. ( LAUGHTER )
SO, OKAY, I'M JUST-- I'M JUST  CONFUSED. YOU'RE NULLIFYING THE STATE'S  NULLIFICATION LAW.
IN SIMPLE TERMS, YES, THAT'S  CORRECT.
BUT THAT'S NOT LEGAL.
YES. WE FEEL NULLIFICATION IS  SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE DONE,  BUT IF IT CAN BE DONE, WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. LAUGH.
ALL THIS LEGAL SPEAK IS VERY  CONFUSING. EXPLAIN DID WITH SOME CUN TECHIE  FOLKSINESS.
WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS  GOOD FOR THE GANDER?
WHAT THE HELL IS A GANDER?
THE MEAN IS IF ONE CAN DO IT  THE OTHER CAN DO IT.
LIKE I SAED, WHAT'S A GANDER?
UM... ( LAUGHTER )  I CAN GUESS. AND I MAY BE CORRECT. BUT I MAY NOT, EITHER, SO.
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING IT SINCE  YOU WERE A KID.
YEAH.
LOOK IT UP. BUT THAYER ISN'T CONCERNED WITH  JUDGE TURNER'S NULLIFICATION  PROPOSAL.
IT PROO-- IT PROBABLY-- I  THINK HE-- I THINK IT PROBABLY  LACKS LEGAL STANDING.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR NULLIFICATION  THAT ALSO LACKS LEGAL STANDING?
THAT'S PART OF THE DEBATE. ( LAUGHTER )  I'M NOT SURE THAT, THAT JUDGE  TURNER'S NULLIFICATION OF  NULLIFICATION ISN'T MORE THAN A PUBLICITY STUNT ON HIS BEHALF.
WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS  NOT GOOD FOR THE.
GANDER?
AND THE GAND SER A.
MALE GOOSE?
EXACTLY. IS THAT SO WHROOEP ( BLEEP )  HARD? IF THE FEDS CAN GET NULLIFIED BY  THE STATES, WHICH THEY CAN'T,  AND THE STATE CAN GET NULLIFIED BY THE COUNTY, WHICH THEY CAN'T  YDID IS END?
IT IS A VICIOUS CIRC EXPELLED  MAY BE ONE THAT TURNS AROUND AND  BITES US. I THINK IF OUR CITIZENS ROSE UP  AND DECIDE THEY WANTED TO  INDIVIDUALLY NULLIFY LAWS HANDED TO THEM, THEN, YES, WE WOULD  HAVE THAT COS. WE WOULD HAVE ANARCHY.
NO, I DON'T EYE DON'T SEE  THAT HAPPENING.
JUDGE TURNER THINKS IT WILL  HAPPEN.
WE IN KENTUCKY ARE A  LAW-ABIDING SOCIETY.
HE'S RIGHT, KENTUCKY IS A  LAW-ABIDING SOCIETY EXCEPT FOR  THE LAWS THEY DON'T FEEL THEY NEED TO ABIDE BY. SO ARE THERE ANY LAWS THAT  AFFECT YOUR LIFE THAT YOU WOULD  LIKE TO SEE NULLIFIED?
I DON'T THINK IT'S A RIGHT TO  PULL SOMEONE OVER BECAUSE THEY  DIDN'T WEAR A SEAT BELT. MOTORCYCLES DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A  SEAT BELT.
I PERSONALLY THINK I CAN  HANDLE MY DRINKS, AND I THINK  THE D.U.I. LAWS IN THIS STATE, FOR INSTANCE, ARE A LITTLE BIT  LOW.
SMOKING, I DON'T SMOKE, BUT I  THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO  SMOKE WHEREVER YOU WANT.
YOU CAN HANDLE MORE. >>UN, ONE TIME I BLEW A .22, AND  I WAS STILL PRETTY DARN LUCID.
WHO ARE THE COUNTY OR STATE  OR LEFT-WING LIBERALS IN D.C. TO  TELL US WHAT TO DO? AMERICANS KNOW BEST AT THE LOCAL  LEVEL.
YOU LIKE FRESH AIR, RIGHT? THERE GU.
AND LAWS SHOULDN'T APPLY TO  US IF WE DIDN'T VOTE FOR THE  PEOPLE WHO MADE THEM. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, IS IT REALLY  GOING TO KILL SOMEONE?
( BLEEP ). WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR  OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN.
John: THANK YOU, JASON. WE'LL BE R
