Jon: WELCOME BACK. THIS IS A SEGMENT WE CALL "BACK  IN BLACK." IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO ITALY,  YOU'D HAVE GOOD REASON TO  BELIEVE IT'S THE MOST  GAY-FRIENDLY COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD. IT'S BASICALLY NOTHING BUT  BEAUTIFUL MEN AND NECKERCHIEFS  AND FITTED SUITS RIDING AROUND  IN VESPAS AND KISSING ON THE  CHEEKS. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON MICHAEL  ANGELO, A STRAIGHT GUY THROWS PANTS ON THAT. BUT THERE'S ONE GUIDO THAT IS  NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE GAY  LIFE-STYLE. WHEN I SAY "GUIDO" I'M NOT BEING RACIST.
CHAIRMAN GUIDO BARILLA.
Jon: THE GUY'S NAME IS GUIDO. HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE  BARILLA PASTA COMPANY THAT LAST  WEEK WENT ON AN ITALIAN RADIO  SHOW AND STUCK A WHOLE  BOOT-SHAPED COUNTRY INTO HIS  MOUTH.
THE ITALIAN COMPANY THAT  MAKES BARILLA PASTA IS FACING A  BOYCOTT AFTER ITS PRESIDENT SAID SAME-SEX COUPLES WILL NOT BE  FEATURED IN ITS COMMERCIALS.
I WOULD NEVER DO A COMMERCIAL WITH THEM. NOT FOR LACK OF RESPECT FOR  HOMOSEXUAL FAMILY, BUT BECAUSE  WE DON'T THINK LIKE THEM. WE THINK OURS IS A CLASSIC  FAMILY.
YOU KNOW, THE CLASSIC ITALIAN FAMILY. SITTING DOWN TO A CLASSIC  ITALIAN DINNER.
SHUT UP, WILL YOU?
HEY!
HEY, WATCH THE SHIRT, PLEASE.
I TOLD YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS  OUT OF THE PLATE.
OKAY. [APPLAUSE] OKAY. THAT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S FUNNY. IT'S NOT FAIR. THOSE ARE FICTIONAL CHARACTERS. REAL ITALIANS DON'T ACT LIKE  THAT.
PROSTITUTION, WHORE.
THAT'S THE KIND OF FAMILY WE  NEED TO PROTECT FROM GAYS. BUT I'M NOT BUYING YOUR WHOLE  FAMILY VALUES THINGS, GUIDO. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOUR PASTA  ADS. THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL  FAMILIES. THESE ARE HORNY WOMEN READY TO  BANG THE FIRST HANDSOME STRANGER THAT KNOWS HOW TO THROW A  HANDFUL OF TWIGS INTO A POT FULL OF BOILING WATER. IT'S 50 SHADES OF TORTELLINI. THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO BE  PISSED OFF AT GUIDO BARILLA. BUT THE REASON IS HE OPENED THE  DOOR FOR THIS.
BARILLA IS IN HOT WATER.
THE PASTA MAKER BARILLA IS IN BOILING WATER.
THE WORLD'S LARGEST PASTA  MAKER IN DECIDEDLY HOT WATER.
ALL OF WHICH MEANS WITHOUT AN APOLOGY, THOSE COMMENTS COULD  NOW COST BARILLA A PRETTY PENNE.
STOP IT!  OR I SWEAR I WILL PUNCH YOU IN  THE MOUTH-A-TONI. WE GET IT. GUIDO IS IN TROUBLE. I'M SURE AS SOON AS HE HEARD  WHAT CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH, HE  TRIED TO SUCK IT BACK IN.
HE WENT ON TO SAY IF GAYS  DIDN'T LIKE THE POLICY, THEY  COULD EAT ANOTHER BRAND OF  PASTA.
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE BRAND  OF DRIED BEIGE NOODLES IN A BOX? WHO KNEW? AND NOW ALL OF THEM ARE BATTLING IT OUT TO BE THE WORLD'S GAYEST  PASTA, INCLUDING SAN REMO THAT  PROUDLY PRO CLAIMED THAT WE'RE  ALL FAMILY HERE. AND I FOR ONE WILL BE BUYING SAN REMO PASTA NEXT TIME I GET A  CRAVING FOR SKITTLES FLAVORED  VAGINA SHELLS
