Jon: OUR GUEST TONIGHT  SINGER, DANCER, ACTRESS, NEW  MOVIE IS CALLED "PARKER."
PEOPLE TELL ME I'M SHARP,  VERY SHARM. PEOPLE COME DOWN HERE FOR ONE  REASON:  MONEY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE INTO,  KIDNAPPING, EXTORTION, ROBBERY  BUT WHATEVER IT IS, YOU'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT.
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES.
WHAT?
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M BETTER  OFF WITH YOU ALIVE OR DEAD  EITHER WAY I HAVE TO KNOW IF YOU ARE WEARING A WIRE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME  JENNIFER LOPEZ. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
HELLO!
Jon: WELCOME.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
Jon: IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
SO DO WE -- THIS WAY, THIS  WAY? DOES IT MATTER.
Jon: WHERE YOU WANT TO  LOOK?
NO, I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE THIS BUT YOU'RE  THERE.
Jon: LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT  WE DO. [ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL  IGNORE.
Jon: I WILL NOT FEEL  IGNORED IN ANYWAY. I EXPECT TO BE IGNORED BY A  WOMAN LIKE YOURSELF.
NEVER THAT. NEVER THAT.
Jon: I'M USED TO THIS SINCE  I WAS 14. HAVE YOU EVER PERFORMED FOR THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  IN YOUR LIFE?
NO, I HAVE NOT.
Jon: WHAT IS THE MOST NERVE  WRACKING PERFORMANCE YOU HAVE  HAD TO DO IN YOUR LIFETIME, WOULD YOU SAY?
I WAS ASKED TO PERFORM FOR  THE PRESIDENT AT HIS HOUSE.
Jon: WHAT?
NO, NO, NOT THAT AT THE WHITE  HOUSE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY WARNED ME ABOUT YOU. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THIS MUST HAVE BEEN  DURING THE CLINTON  ADMINISTRATION. [ LAUGHTER ]
NO, NO NEW YORK CITY. -- NO, NO, NO. IT WAS NERVE WRACKING TO EVEN  THINK ABOUT IT. I COULDN'T DO IT ACTUALLY  BECAUSE I WAS DOING SOMETHING  ELSE. I THINK I WAS ON A FILM OR  SOMETHING SO I COULDN'T DO IT  BUT THE IDEA OF IT IT WAS LIKE OH, MY GOD WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN  YOU GO THERE.
Jon: THERE'S A CONTROVERSY  NOW. BEYONCE SANG THAT BEAUTIFUL  RENDITION AT THE INAUGURATION. IT'S HER VOICE SHE JUST  PRERECORDED IT.
SURE.
Jon: AS A PERFORMER IS THAT  CONSIDERED AN ACCEPTABLE THING  FOR YOU?
SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS IN  CERTAIN STADIUMS OR VENUES THEY  PRERECORD THINGS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE TERRIBLE FLAT BACK  AND -- YOU KNOW?
Jon: SURE THE FLAT BACK.
PEOPLE DO IT. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. I COULD BE WRONG SO --
Jon: YOU ARE GOING TO  WHITNEY HOUSTON 1991.
SHE WAS ALSO RECORD. EVERYBODY LOVED IT. IT WAS A HUGE HIT, BUT I THINK  IT WAS, TOO.
Jon: I WOULD ALSO THINK AS  SOMEBODY WHO DANCES AS WELL YOU  HAVE TO DO THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE YOU ARE RUNNING AROUND  AND YOU ARE OUT OF BREATHE  UNLESS RIGHT NOW ASKING THAT QUESTION:  I'M WINDED. [ LAUGHTER ]
RIGHT. SOMETIMES. YOU DO. ALL PERFORMERS HAVE TO DO IT AT  SOME POINT. YEAH.
Jon: ME AS WELL.
YOU RECORD THE JOKES JUST IN  CASE.
Jon: NO, NOBODY CARES. WE PRERECORD THE HECKLES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ABOUT THIS? BACK TO THE ACTION. WHEN DO YOU -- OR MAYBE YOU  DON'T SLEEP. YOU ARE COMING OFF THE WORLD  TOUR. YOU ARE DOING THE MOVIES YOU  HAVE -- WHAT IS IT TWINS?
YES, I HAVE TWINS.
Jon: HOW OLD ARE THE TWINS?
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FIVE  NEXT MONTH. THEY ARE GETTING SO BIG.
Jon: HOW DO YOU GO ON A  WORLD TOUR WITH TWO KIDS? DO THEY GO WITH YOU?
YES. I HAD NEVER BEEN ON A WORLD  TOUR. I TOWARD BUT NEVER THE WHOLE  ENTIRE WORLD. HIS TO SIGN ON FOR LIKE SEVEN  MONTHS. AND THE THOUGHT OF JUST DOING  THE TOUR FOR ME WAS LIKE OH, MY  GOD THIS IS DAUNTING. I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD DO THIS  AND THINKING ABOUT IT WITH THE  BABIES HOW ARE THEY GOING TO HOLD UP BUT WE HAD A GREAT TIME.
Jon: ARE THEY DECENT  TRAVELER?
THEY ARE GREAT TRAVELERS. THEY ARE BETTER TRAVELERS. SOMETIMES WE WOULD FORGET. THEY TAKE IT SO GOOD AND THE  BAGS AND WE'RE TIRED ANT SHOWS  AND THE WHOLE THING AND THE ASKED JEWEL VERY, VERY DEMANDING  AND THEY'D WOULD BE LIKE --  SOMETIMES THEY GET CRANKY AND AH, HE'S ACT UP. YOU FEEL LIKE CRAP HOW DO YOU  THINK HE FEELS. FOUR YEARS OLD.
Jon: I LOVE TRAVELING WITH  KIDS BECAUSE NO MATTER WRL YOU  GO YOU CAN SEW WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BRING HOME INTO THE INSIDE OF  THEIR CLOTHES.
DIDN'T OCCUR TO AMERICA VILE  TOLL REMEMBER THAT.
Jon: THEY ARE RARELY CHECK  CHILDREN.
IT'S ALL OF.
Jon: IT IS ALL OF. THE ENERGY YOU TAKE FROM THAT,  IS IT TOO JARRING TO GO BACK TO  FILM? IS FILM TOO SLOW FOR YOU NOW? HAS YOUR PERSPECTIVE CHANGED  DOING ONE FORM VERSUS ANOTHER?
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S A  TYPE OF THING WHERE YOU ARE  DOING THE TOUR ALL ADRENALIN ALL THE TIME. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PACE. BUT WHEN YOU GO BACK TO A FILM  YOU ENJOY THAT PACE AS WELL. IT'S MUCH SLOWER IS. THERE'S A LOT OF DOWNTIME IN  BETWEEN SETUP AND TAKES. I GET TO BACK AND FORTH. IT'S REALLY NICE.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU. YOU ON AMERICAN IDOL YOU WERE  REALLY GOOD WITH THAT. YOU GAVE THEM NICE AND YOU WERE  NICELY -- WHERE STEVEN TYLER  WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE YOU REALLY -- [ LAUGHTER ] I THOUGHT YOU REALLY MADE SENSE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SO THAT WAS NICE. YOU MADE A SENSE AND HE WAS LIKE  DEE. EXACTLY. PARKER GOOD FLICK?
IT'S A GOOD FLICK. GOOD ACTION FLICK. GOOD DRAWMA. IT'S LIKE OUT OF THE SIGHT AND  TRANSPORTER HAD A BABY AND IT'S  PARKER. YOU WOULD LOVE IT.
