FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY! YES! YES! WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART, MY GUEST TONIGHT, MATT BAI. MATT BAI IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF "ALL THE TRUTH IS OUT." IT'S AN INCREDIBLE BOOK ABOUT WHEN OUR MEDIA DECIDED TO GET TERRIBLE. BUT FIRST, MIDTERM FEVER, BABY. SWEEPING THE NATION. IT'S JUST LIKE EBOLA. EXCEPT WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. (LAUGHTER) WITH THREE WEEKS TO GO, IT IS ESTIMATED 5.5 TO 6.5 BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE SPENT ON THE CAMPAIGNS. OR TO PUT THAT IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, ENOUGH MONEY TO HAZMAT, SUIT UP, EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA AND SILKWOOD SHOWER THOSE MOTHER [BLEEP] TILL ELECTION DAY. LET'S DO IT. LET'S DO IT. IS THAT A SILKWOOD SHOWER? (APPLAUSE) ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR, VERY UPSET ABOUT THE INFLUENCE THAT MONEY HAS ON OUR POLITICS.
WE MUST REDUCE THE ROLE OF MONEY IN POLITICS.
STEM THE CORROSIVE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS.
THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF MONEY.
THE UNENDING CHASE FOR MONEY THREATENS TO STEAL OUR DEMOCRACY ITSELF.
Jon: MY ADVICE TO DEMOCRACY, IS THAT WE COULD END THIS CHASE FOR MONEY, BY HAVING DEMOCRACY MARRY A CONDIMENT HEIRESS. HERE, IT, WORKED FOR ME, BUT MOVE ALONG, KETCHUP IS TAKEN. (LAUGHTER) PERHAPS I COULD SET DEMOCRACY UP WITH BETTE POUPON. (LAUGHTER) WHO'S THE HEIR TO THE-- I JUST LIKE DOING HIS VOICE. BUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE OUTRAGED. AND THEIR OUTRAGE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY, MONEY. (LAUGHTER) THE PILLOW SMOTHERING OUR DEMOCRACY IN ITS HOSPITAL BED. (LAUGHTER) THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.
IN THE TEN SENATE RACES WHERE THE MOST OUTSIDE MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT, LIBERAL GROUPS HAVE OUTSPENT CONSERVATIVES -- 97 MILLION TO 79 MILLION.
THERE ARE STATES WHERE THE DEMOCRATS ARE OUTSPENDING FIVE OR TEN TO ONE.
DEMOCRATS HAVE REALIZED THESE ARE THE RULES OF THE GAME. AS MUCH AS THEY PROFESS NOT TO LIKE THEM.
HERE A TIP. IT MAY UNDERCUT YOUR YOUR MESSAGE WHEN ARE YOU CONDEMNING A THING THAT YOU HAVE CLEARLY MASTERED. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THOU SHALLT NOT KILL, BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO, SINGLE SHOT, BACK OF THE HEAD, YOU WANT A CARBON STEEL HACK SAW, THEN PUT THE PARTS IN SEVERAL TRASH BAGS, SPREAD THEM OUT OVER A FOREST -- PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T APPLAUD THAT ONE. THAT'S NOT-- THAT'S REALLY, WHEN YOU CAN EXPLAIN HOW TO KILL SOMEBODY, AND THE CROWD IS LIKE YES. (LAUGHTER) ME LIKEY. (LAUGHTER) AND RECENTLY THE DEMOCRATS RETICENCE FOR FUND-RAISING WAS TRULY ON DISPLAY.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HEADED TO HIS 53rd FUND-RAISER OF THE YEAR AT GWYNETH PALTROW'S HOUSE.
TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT WILL ATTEND A FUND-RAISER FOR THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE OR THE DSCC AT THE HOME OF REAL ESTATE MOGUL RICH RICHMAN.
Jon: WHAT?  (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT YOUR CONTEMPT FOR MONEY IN POLITICS WITH BACK-TO-BACK FUND-RAISERS FROM THE HOMES OF LADY GOOP, AND LITERALLY A MAN NAMED RICHIE RICH. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN THERE ARE-- NO, CHANCES ARE, THE REAL RICHIE RICH, MY GUESS IS HE'S SLIGHTLY TALLER. AND THEN OF COURSE, THERE ARE THE E-MAILS. OH DEAR GOD, THE E-MAILS FROM THE DEMOCRATS. WITH THE FREQUENCY AND DESPERATION MATCHED ONLY BY A NIGERIAN PRINCE SELLING A GROUP-ON DEAL FOR BONER PILLS, THE DEMOCRATS AND THE E-MAILS WILL NOT STOP TRYING TO MAKE YOU GIVE THEM MONEY. THESE ARE SOME REAL FUND-RAISING E-MAILS.
HOTEL AND BROADWAY SHOW, ALL ON US. YOU AND POTUS IN L.A. WOW, THOSE SOUND LIKES LIKE EXCITING OFFERS, BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU WEREN'T IMPRESSED BY PALM TREE EMOJIS AND YOUR PRETEND CASUAL FRIENDSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT. THESE ARE REAL. WE KEEP E-MAILING. JOE BIDEN HAS E-MAILED YOU. MICHELLE E-MAILED YOU, AND NOW I'VE E-MAILED YOU. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN LATER THAT DAY THE PARTY FOWARDS THE SAME E-MAIL BACK TO YOU, HEY, JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU SAW THIS E-MAIL FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE WHAT KIND OF A [BLEEP] FOR [BLEEP] WOULD IGNORE A PERSONAL E-MAIL FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA? HE'S BEEN WAITING ALL DAY FOR YOUR RESPONSE. (LAUGHTER) APPARENTLY ISIS IS SMUGGLING EBOLA ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER VIA VLADIMIR PUTIN'S RECTUM BUT THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE JUST SITS THERE ALL DAY REFRESHING HIS E-MAIL BOX, WHY ISN'T HE GETTING BACK TO ME? WHY ISN'T HE GETTING BACK TO ME? CAN'T GET ANY WEIRDER, RIGHT? YEAH, YOU'RE WRONG. WE'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT. (LAUGHTER) WE'RE DONE, GO HOME, GIVE UP. ALL HOPE IS LOST. THESE ARE REAL E-MAILS. ALL HOPE IS LOST? NOT AN E-MAIL FROM YOUR FRIEND SYLVIA PLATH, NOT FROM MINERS TRAPPED FOR THREE WEEKS IN A MINE SHAFT WHO SOMEHOW HAVE ACCESS TO WIFI, BUT FROM A NATIONAL POLITICAL PARTY TRYING TO WIN YOUR VOTE. MY GOD. DOES THE BODY OF THE E-MAIL SAY WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO RESTORE HOPE?
TO GET THE DEMOCRATS OFF THE LEDGE? WHAT DOES IT TAKE A MILLION DOLLARS, A KIDNEY? NO, FIVE [BLEEP] DOLLARS. $5. THIS IS THE END, GOOD-BYE, CRUEL WORLD! UNLESS OF COURSE YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY ME 12 INCHES OF SANDWICH. HMMMM? HMMMM? HMMMM? (APPLAUSE) NONE OF THESE E-MAILS, NONE OF THESE E-MAILED FREAKED US OUT AT THIS SHOW MORE THAN THIS ONE WHICH HAPPENED TO MENTION, JUST BY THE BY, THAT QUOTE, ACCORDING TO THEIR RECORDS, I HADN'T PITCHED IN YET. THEIR RECORDS. I GUESS NOW WE KNOW WHAT THE NSA DATA CENTER IS FOR. (LAUGHTER) WE CROSS REFERENCED YOUR E-MAIL ACCOUNT, VISA BILLS AND MEDICAL RECORDS AND YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN US JACK. YOU DIDN'T MENTION PLANS TO DONATE TO YOUR ACCOUNTANT WHO YOU CALLED AT 10:02 A.M. THIS MORNING. THE DEMOCRATS, THESE E-MAILS ARE JUST EMBARRASSING AT THIS POINT. AT WHAT POINT --
OH JON?
WHAT WAS THAT?
BEHIND YOU, BIG GUY.
WHAT THE? OH, GOD. MORE FUND-RAISING E-MAILS.
HEY, FUNNYMAN, LONG TIME NO DONATE.
Jon: IT'S THE MIDDLE OF MY SHOW, I CAN'T --
WELL, YOU IGNORED ALL OUR OTHER E-MAILS SO WE FIGURED WE WOULD TAKE IT PUBLIC. SHAME YOU INTO, YOU KNOW-- .
Jon: YOU WANT ME TO PROJECTILE VOMIT MONEY? IS THAT, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. I'M NOT GONNA -- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
OH, OKAY. LISTEN, GIVE ME YOUR MONEY, OR I WILL SEE YOU IN HELL.
Jon: IS $5 OKAY, I WILL GET YOU THE --
OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT! GIDDYAP. GET THAT GREEN. LOVING THAT MONEY. LOVING THAT MONEY, WHOOO!
Jon: OKAY SO, WE'RE GOOD THEN, I GUESS WE'RE GOOD.
OH, WE'RE GOOD, BUDDY.
FOR NOW.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
