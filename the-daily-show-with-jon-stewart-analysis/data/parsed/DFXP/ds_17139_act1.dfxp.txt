HUGE SUCCESS THREE WAYS. ONE, THE GAMES WERE EXCITING, EMOTIONAL, COMPELLING AND VERY WELL EXECUTED BY THE HOST CITY. NUMBER TWO, BRITAIN GOT TO DO WHAT EVERYONE HAS WANTED TO DO: DRIVE THE SPICE GIRLS OFF A  CLIFF THELMA AND LOUISE STYLE. SLOW DOWN. SHE'S JUST A BABY. ROBERT PATTINSON IS OUR GUEST TONIGHT (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN WHAT HE WILL SAY ABOUT THE OLYMPICS. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING THIS SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO, LET ME ASSURE YOU, MR. PATTINSON WILL COME OUT. BUT YOU DO HAVE ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF VICE PRESIDENT SHALL JOKES TO PLOW THROUGH. WE HAVE TO CATCH UP ON THE WEEKEND'S POLITICAL EVENTS. THIS IS A COMEDY SHOW DEALING MOSTLY WITH POLITICS. IN POLITICS, THERE WAS ONLY ONE STORY TO COVER THIS WEEKEND.
BREAKING NEWS. MITT ROMNEY CHOOSES WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
Jon: WAIT. WHAT? THAT GUY NEXT TO ROMNEY IS NOT ALREADY A ROMNEY? ARE YOU SURE THAT'S NOT LIKE RICK ROMNEY OR CHAD OR BUZZ ROMNEY? APPARENTLY ROMNEY UNVEILED HIS VICE PRESIDENT SHALL CHOICE AT A RALLY ON SATURDAY MORNING ON ON  THE DECK OF THE BATTLESHIP U.S.S. WISCONSIN A SHIP ON WHICH BOTH MEN SERVED I'M SORRY A SHIP  WHERE THEY WERE SERVED REFRESHMENT.
PLEASE WELCOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, GOVERNOR MITT LOMB KNEE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: OKAY. HERE I COME. OH, BOY, GOLLY, THAT'S A LOT OF STAIRS. OH, YES, OH, IS THAT ANOTHER ESCALATOR. OKAY. CAN I GET A ZIP LINE TO THIS  [BLEEP]. THE MAIN EVENT
JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PAUL RYAN.
Jon: THAT'S FUNNY. THAT'S FUNNY. A LITTLE BIT OF A SMALL GAFFE. OBAMA ACTUALLY DID THE SAME THING IN 200. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL UNLESS THE CROWD HAS A REALLY LONG TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW AWKWARD THE  MISTAKE IS WHILE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MAKES HIS WAY DOWN THE STAIRS  AND OVER THE MONKEY BARS, DOWN THE ROPE SWING. DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE... WOW. LET ME SAY THIS. A GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T PICK CHRIS CHRISTIE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. I'LL RUN IN 2016. THE MEDIA'S REACTION TO ROMNEY'S SELECTION WAS SWIFT AND UNIVERSAL.
WHAT MITT ROMNEY DID IS CREATED ENTHUSIASM, ENERGY, AUTHENTICITY AND SUBSTANCE.
IT WILL MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE AND SOLUTIONS.
WE CAN HAVE A RACE WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES OF OUR COUNTRY
MANY PEOPLE HAVE SPENT THE PAST SIX MONTHS SAYING, GUYS, WHEN IS THIS ELECTION GOING TO GET SERIOUS? IT JUST GOT SERIOUS.
Jon: BECAUSE OF PAUL RYAN? AS THE MEDIA, WOULDN'T YOU HAVE MADE IT A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE REAL ISSUES FROM THE START? OR DID A GYPSY PUT ON CURSE ON YOU? HELLO, MEDIA, YOU WILL BABBLE BULL [BLEEP] UNTIL A MAN FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY IS CHOSEN BY  THE MORMON. GOOD LUCK. HE WILL NEVER MAKE IT. (MANIACAL LAUGHING) AND AS PART OF [BLEEP] YOU'LL BE FORCED TO TWEET. IF THIS WHAT IT TAKES SO BE IT. TO THE SUBSTANTIVE NEW DISCOURSE
HE WAS PROM KING. SLEEPS IN HIS OFFICE LIKES TO HUNT ELK EVEN DROVE THE FAMOUS WEANER MOBILE
HE GETS A CHARGE OUT OF THE CATCHING GIANT CATFISH WITH HIS BARE HANDS
HE WOULD BE THE FIRST FROM WISCONSIN AND THE FIRST NAMED PAUL.
ALREADY TEACHING THE RYANS THE BEAUTY PEANUT BUTTER AND HONEY SANDWICH
HE'S A FITNESS BUFF WHO GOT SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES HOOKED ON  A GRUELING EXERCISE ROUTINE CALLED P90X.
Jon: HOW INTERESTING. PAUL RYAN... A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT SOMEONE WITH THAT MUCH POWER IS SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO LATE  NIGHT INFOMERCIALS ALTHOUGH WE KNOW BIDEN'S CHALLENGES WITH THE  IMPULSE CONTROL STARTED WITH THE SNUGG
E AND BOUGHT A SWILT, A SWEATER-QUILT. HE ALSO OWNS TWO PAIRS OF SOCKS AND OBVIOUSLY FOR STATE OCCASIONS THE SNUG-KITO. PLEASE, MR. AMBASSADOR, MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. I HAVE. ALL RIGHT. WE GET IT. THE GUY IS A WORKOUT MACHINE. HE CAN CATCH CATFISH WITH HIS BARE HANDS EVEN THOUGH HE COULD USE A REEL EASILY. IS IS THERE ANY SUBSTANCE THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT HERE?
PAUL RYAN WAS A TERRIFIC DECISION HAS BROUGHT ENORMOUS ENERGY TO THIS TICKET
HE'S EXCITING. HE'S YOUNG. HE'S ATTRACTIVE. HE'S ENERGIZING THE BASE
THERE ARE A LOT OF PARALLELS TO SARAH PALIN
FEELS LIKE IT COULD BE SARAH PALIN WITH SUBSTANCE AND A PAPER TRAIL.
Jon: SO NOT SARAH PALIN. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY A THING IS JUST LIKE ANOTHER THING BUT WITHOUT THE THING THAT DEFINES  THAT THING. THEN YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT THING. THIS THING IS AMAZING. IT'S LIKE BICYCLE WITHOUT WHEELS OR HANDLE BARS. YEAH, IT'S A [BLEEP] CHAIR. IT'S A CHAIR. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE MAN AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR. THROW RYAN UP THERE
LOOK, WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT REAL THINGS. THIS GI HAS A RECORD. HE'S A SIX-TERM CONGRESSMAN WITH A REPUTATION AS A FISCAL CONSERVATIVE. HE WANTS TO CHANGE MEDICARE. CHANGE IT INTO A VOUCHER SYSTEM. THAT IS GOING TO DESTROY THE PROGRAM... HIS EYES ARE SO BLUE. IT'S LIKE LOOKING INTO A SMURF'S ANUS. ♪ THE DREAM WEAVER ♪♪ ♪ I BELIEVE HE CAN GET ME  THROUGH THE NIGHT ♪♪ ♪ DREAM WEAVER ♪♪
Jon: ARE THEY REALLY THAT BLUE? WE'LL BE RIGHT
