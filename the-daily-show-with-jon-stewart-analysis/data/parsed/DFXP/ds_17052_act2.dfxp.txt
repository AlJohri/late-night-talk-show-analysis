(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO FLORIDA VOTERS, WE CAN ASSUME THAT NEWT GINGRICH HAS  THE KEY LARGE HEADED WHITE MALE LOCKED UP. CAN HE WIN THE SUPPORT OF A DEMOGRAPHIC EVEN GREATER IN NUMBER IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. WE SENT JASON JONES TO MIAMI TO FIND OUT.
Reporter: IF NEWT GINGRICH IS GOING TO WIN THE FLORIDA PRIMARY TOMORROW HE'LL HAVE TO  WIN OVER ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VOTING BLOCKS: THE LADIES. SO I ASSEMBLED A PANEL OF FLORIDA WOMEN TO GAUGE GINGRICH'S CHANCES. OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING NEWT GINGRICH CAN SAY OR DO TO WIN YOUR VOTE?
NOTHING.
Reporter: NOTHING.
NOTHING.
Reporter: NOTHING WHATSOEVER.
NOTHING.
BOTTOM LINE HE'S NOT TRUST WORTHY.
I THINK IT'S FOOLISH OF OTHER POOM TO TRUST SOMEBODY WITH HIS HISTORY.
I THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. AS YOU GET OLDER, I THINK YOU GET WISER.
I THINK HE'S A CREEP.
AS LONG AS HE CAN DO HIS JOB AS HE PROMISED AS A POLITICIAN, THAT'S THE MOST  IMPORTANT THING.
I THINK HE'S GARBAGE.
Reporter: I WAS BEGINNING TO SENSE A PATTERN EMERGING HERE BUT WHAT WAS IT?
I WAS A FIRST WIFE.
I WAS A FIRST.
Reporter: AND THEN THERE WERE THE UNDIVORCED TROPHY WIVES. THIS GROUP OF FIRST WIVES WE'LL CALL THE JACKIES AND THIS SECOND GROUP OF MARY ANNs  OPPOSED NEWT ON VIRTUALLY EVERY ISSUE WHILE THIS THIRD GROUP, OUR CALLISTAs AGREED  WITH HIM AT EVERY TURN.
IT'S REALLY A SMART MAN AND A POLITICIAN THAT CAN ACTUALLY COMBINE FAMILY AND WORK.
WAIT A SECOND.
HE CLAIMS TO HAVE CHRISTIAN VALUES. HE CLAIMS TO BE A MORAL PERSON.
HE'S A CATHOLIC NOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF HYPOCRITES IN THIS WORLD.
WHEN HE LEFT THE SECOND WIFE WITH M.S., IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME BECAUSE HE HAD  DONE IT BEFORE.
Reporter: IS THERE AN APPROPRIATE DISEASE YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR WIFE FOR?
NO. ONCE YOU'RE A CHEATER, YOU'RE ALWAYS A CHEATER.
DID HE PROMISE SOMETHING HE DIDN'T KEEP? I'M JUST ASKING.
ETHICS COMMITTEE VIOLATION. HE GOT KICKED OUT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WAS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON BEHIND IT THAT WE DON'T KNOW.
Reporter: EXACTLY. DID YOU EVER THINK THAT MAYBE HIS KNEES AS SPEAKER WERE NOT BEING MET?
NO.
Reporter: SO ALWAYS HIS FAULT. WITH VOTING FOR THE FLORIDA PRIMARY JUST HOURS AWAY, GINGRICH HOPES TO HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH FLORIDA'S FOURTH AND LARGEST DIVORCEE DEMO. THE EX-WIFE CLEARLY GUNNING FOR HER OWN REALITY SHOW DEMO.
I'M GOING TO THROW UP. REALLY? DO I WANT TO MEET YOU AND YOUR BITCH AT (BEEP)? ARE YOU KIDDING? I'M GOING TO PUKE.
Jon: JASON JONES. WE'LL
