JULY 12, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THE GREAT KID ROCK WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT, AND I'M GOING TO GO WITH SHARK. ALL RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOLKS, I'M GOING TO START WITH A PROBLEM. WE GOT A PROBLEM. APPARENTLY AMERICA SPENDS MORE THAN IT TAKES IN. SO AMERICA NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BECOME MORE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE AMERICA FIGURES IT OUT, THERE IS A REPO  MAN, LET'S CALL HIM "CHINA," THAT ON AUGUST 2nd COULD POSSIBLY REPOSSESS US. [LAUGHTER] THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD DEBT REDUCTION OPTIONS AT OUR DISPOSAL. WORSE COMES TO WORSE, WE COULD FOR SOME WEIRD REASON ARBITRARILY CHANGE THE MONEY  WE'RE ALLOWED TO BE IN DATE, WHICH MAKES NO [BLEEPED] SENSE WHATSOEVER, BUT THE BAD NEWS IS THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF PUTTING  TOGETHER THIS COUNTRY-SAVING PLANS ARE THE SAME ONES WHO AS OF TODAY ARE CURRENTLY ON THE  FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DOING THIS.
THE NEW INCANDESCENT BULB LOOKS AND WORKS JUST LIKE THE OLD INCANDESCENT BULB.
SO IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL, WE MIGHT AS WELL TURN OUT THE LIGHTS. THE PARTY IS OVER FOR THE TRADITIONAL INCANDESCENT LIGHTBULB. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR, THEY AREN'T FIGHTING ABOUT LIGHTBULB STANDARDS. THEY ARE REFIGHTING A LIGHTBULB STANDARDS FIGHT THAT WE SET NEW ZEALAND 2007. WE'RE THREE WEEKS A I WAY FROM HAVING TO PARK OUR COUNTRY DOWN  THE STREET SO CHINA CAN'T FIND IT. [LAUGHTER] AND THESE YUTSES ARE RELIT GAITING INCANDESCENT V. FLORESCENT. WE ARE LIKE CHILDREN. THAT IS WHY YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN DAD, MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN, HAD TO COME HOME EARLY FROM WORK AND  GIVE US A TALKING TO ABOUT NOT CLEANING OUR BUDGET.
WE'RE GOING TO MEET EVERY SINGLE DAY UNTIL WE GET THIS THING RESOLVED. WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DONE BY AUGUST 2nd. WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT NOW. PULL OFF THE BANDAID. EAT OUR PEAS. [LAUGHTER]
WHO KEEPS PEAS UNDER THEIR BANDAIDS? [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, YOU GET THE SENSE THAT OBAMA IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY THAT BEGINS EVERY PRESS  CONFERENCE WITH A HEAVY SIGH. [LAUGHTER] HE JUST COMES OUT AND GOES... [LONG SIGH] I GUESS HE HAD NO IDEA HAVING CHILDREN WOULD BE THIS HARD. WAIT, I'M BEING TOLD THAT HIS PEAS MENTION WAS NOT A METAPHOR. DURING BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS, APPARENTLY SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN BOEHNER WAS LITERALLY NOT EATING HIS PEAS. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS THE CASE. SO ANYWAY, HERE'S WHAT OBAMA PROPOSED TO GET US OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. DEMOCRATS GET $1 TRILLION IN UPPER-CLASS TAX INCREASES AND CORPORATE LOOPHOLE CLOSURES, AND REPUBLICANS GET $3 THRIL IN ENTITLEMENT AND SPENDING CUTS BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER  THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PARAMETERS OF THE NEGOTIATION ARE THAT DEMOCRATS WANT TAX  INCREASES AND REPUBLICANS WANT SPENDING CUTS, AND HE WANTS TO DO A PEAS AND BANDAID COMBINATION. [BLEEPED] I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THEY'RE IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NEGOTIATION.
MOST AMERICANS WOULD SAY A BALANCED APPROACH IS A SIMPLE ONE. THE ADMINISTRATION GETS ITS DEBT LIMIT INCREASE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET THEIR SPENDING CUTS. AND THEIR REFORMS.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? YOU SEE THE PROBLEM? THE ADMINISTRATION GETS ITS DEBT LIMIT INCREASE. THE ARBITRARY SPENDING LIMIT, WHICH CONGRESS HAS RELEASED TEN TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. NOW THAT'S THE BIG GIVE IN THE NEGOTIATION. IT'S NOT, ALL RIGHT, LET'S ALL CHIP IN AND BUY A GETTING FOR THE PARTY. IT'S BUY ME A KEG AND I WON'T BURN YOUR [BLEEPED] HOUSE DOWN. NOW, WHY WOULD OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATS GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY A GIVE?
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT NOT RAISING THE DEBT CEILING. I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT DISCUSSED BY ANYBODY, NOT IN THE CONGRESS. YEAH, NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT DOING THAT.
Jon: [WHISPERING] THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SEE, THE LEADER OF THE SENATE REPUBLICANS STATED ON SUNDAY THAT OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO  RAISE THE DEBT CEILING. NOW, WHY WOULD THE REPUBLICANS GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY CAN PLAY SILLY POLITICS WITH  SOMETHING LIKE OUR CREDIT RATING? BECAUSE IN 2006 THE PRESIDENT AND FRESHMAN SENATOR VOTED AGAINST RAISING THE DEBT CEILING. AND WHY DID HE DO THAT?
THAT WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A NEW SENATOR, YOU KNOW, MAKING WHAT IS A POLITICAL VOTE AS  OPPOSED TO DOING WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY, AND I'M THE FIRST ONE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.
Jon: HEY, MAN, THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO, MAN. [LAUGHTER] I WAS A KID. YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE [BLEEPED] AROUND IN THEIR EARLY 40s. [LAUGHTER] BUT NOW I'M IN MY MID-40s. TIME TO GROW UP. BUT HERE'S THE WORST PART. THE REPUBLICAN INSISTENCE ON MAKING THE DEBT CEILING THEIR GIVE AS OPPOSED TO INCREASED TAX  REVENUES, DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A CYNICAL POLITICAL PLOY. I THINK THEY REALLY BELIEVE THIS  [BLEEPED].
THE PRESIDENT AND I DO NOT AGREE ON HIS VIEW THAT GOVERNMENT NEEDS MORE REVENUE  THROUGH HIGHER TAXES ON JOB CREATORS.
Jon: HIGHER TAXES ON JOB CREATORS? WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT? IT'S LIKE A DOCTOR CONSULTING WITH A PATIENT WHO BELIEVES STRICTLY IN MAGIC. [LAUGHTER] BROKEN LEG? THAT'S NOTHING A FROG WING AND FIRE DANCE AND SOME RHINOCEROS  TUSK BONER POWDER CAN'T CURE. FOR MORE WE GO OUT TO OUR SENIOR CORRESPONDENT WYATT CENAK. WYATT, JOHN BOEHNER AND THE REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO BE SAYING THE WAY TO SHRINK THE DEFICIT IS  TO CUT SPENDING AND THE ONLY WAY TO RAISE REVENUE IS TO CUT TAXES. THAT SEEMS CRAZY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, CAREFUL THROWING AROUND THE WORD "CRAZY"  WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MATTERS OF FAITH. I DON'T SAY YOU'RE CRAZY JUST BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE BATHING IN  THE BLOOD OF CHRISTIAN BABIES WILL BRING ABOUT YOUR MESSIAH.
Jon: WYATT, IF LOWERING TAXES -- WAIT, JEWS DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE BELIEVE.
YES, YOU DO. YOU DO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT YOU'RE MISSING MY POINT. MY POINT IS, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RELIGION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ECONOMIC POLICY.
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT. TO REPUBLICANS, TAX CUTS ARE THEIR RELIGION. REPUBLICANS ARE JOB CREATIONISTS. I SUPPOSE YOU LIBERAL ELITES BELIEVE JOBS JUST EVOLVE FROM MILLIONS OF YEARS OF STIMULUS SPENDING. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WYATT, SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO RAISE TAXES. LOOK, EVEN RONALD REAGAN --
PEACE BE UPON HIM. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HE RAISED TAXES IN 1982 BY NEARLY $100 BILLION IN A RECESSION. IF YOU CAN NEVER RAISE TAXES AND RONALD REAGAN --
PEACE BE UPON HIM. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: REALLY?
I DON'T MAKE THE RULES, JON. JON
Jon: LOOK. IF EVEN THAT GUY RAISED TAXES, DOESN'T THAT AT LEAST CHALLENGE THE CURRENT REPUBLICAN BELIEF SYSTEM?
CYNICS LIKE YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR DOCTRINAL CONTRADICTIONS.
Jon: THE RICH NOW HAVE WAY MORE WEALTH AND INCOME EVEN SINCE THE 80s. REPUBLICANS THINK TAX CUTS RAISE REVENUE, WHY NOT CUT TAXES TO ZERO.
JON, LET ME TELL YOU PARABLE. A HOLY MAN WAS IN THE DESERT AND THE MULTITUDES CAME AND SAID, WE HAVE NO FOOD. HE SAID, HERE ARE FIVE LOAVES AND TWO FISHES AND SO IT WAS THAT THE HOLY MAN AND ONE OF HIS  FRIENDS SAT DOWN AND ATE A  [BLEEPED] LOAD OF FISH SANDWICHES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT ABOUT... [APPLAUSE] WHAT ABOUT THE MULTITUDES?
WHAT ABOUT 'EM? ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT SOCIALIST REDISTRIBUTION OF FISH AND BREAD? WHY PUNISH THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FISHERMAN?
Jon: LOOK, I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND THIS PARABLE'S MESSAGE. HOW DO THE MULTITUDES EAT?
THAT'S NOT THE HOLY MAN'S PROBLEM. AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER?
Jon: THAT'S A BIBLICAL SAYING. CAIN SAID THAT WHEN HE'S TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH MURDERING HIS BROTHER.
YOU CALL IT MURDER. I CALL IT THE MARKET REGULATING THE BROTHER SUPPLY. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: WYATT CENAK, EVE
