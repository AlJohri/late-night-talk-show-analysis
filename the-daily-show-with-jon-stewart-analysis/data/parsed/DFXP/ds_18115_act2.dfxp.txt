(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! WHEN NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH  THE CRACKS, LEWIS BLACK CATCHES  IT FOR A SEGMENT THAT WE CALL "BACK IN BLACK."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THE N.S.A. SCANDAL HAS MADE  US ALL A LITTLE SKEPTICAL OF OUR  TECHNOLOGY. AND WITH THE NEXT WAVE OF FACE  TOYS COMING OUT, YOU MIGHT BE  WONDERING "ARE THE TRADEOFFS WORTH IT?"  WELL, IF ANYONE KNOWS ANYTHING  ABOUT THE LATEST IN TECHNOLOGY  IT'S ROTH! LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
GOOGLE'S FIRST BID IN THAT  MARKET IS GLASS-- WHICH GOES ON  YOUR FACE.
OKAY, GLASS.
GOOGLE, GENESIS.
WELL, THANKS, GLASSES, I  NEVER WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT I  WAS AT THE AQUARIUM LOOKING AT  JELLYFISH! (LAUGHTER)  AT LEAST I KNOW ONE THING I  COULD USE BEFORE.
THIS IS INTERESTING. PEOPLE WHO OWN GOOGLE GLASSES  NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WATCH  PORN ON THEM.
NOT SO FAST, GOOGLE! I THINK YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING  MY ABILITY TO MASTURBATE TO  JELLYFISH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
John: WOW, THAT IS VERY WELL  SAID, LEWIS. (LAUGHTER)
WHO THE (BLEEP) ARE YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
John: THAT'S A FAIR POINT. I APOLOGIZE. CARRY ON. (LAUGHTER)
COME ON, TECH WORLD! IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE US INTO  THE FUTURE, DON'T GIVE US NEW  WAYS TO BE ON THE GO! BEST PART OF NEW TECHNOLOGY IS  THAT IT LETS US SIT ON OUR PASS! THAT'S WHY I WAS SO EXCITED  ABOUT THE NEW XBOX-- UNTIL I SAW  THIS.
SO THE XBOX THAT HASN'T COME  OUT YET BUT IS COMING HAS THIS  MOTION SENSOR THAT DETECTS NOT ONLY YOUR EVERY MOVE AND WHAT  YOU SAY, IT DETECTS FACIAL  EXPRESSIONS. GERMANY'S FEDERAL DATA  PROTECTION COMMISSIONER CALLED  THE KINECT "A TWISTED NIGHTMARE
WHEN THE GERMANS --  (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  ARE CALLING YOUR PRODUCT A TWISTED NIGHTMARE YOU MIGHT WANT  TO CONSIDER TAKING ANOTHER PASS  AT IT. (LAUGHTER)  BUT FINE. THE XBOX IS TRACKING MY EVERY  MOVE. AS LONG AS THAT'S THE ONLY THING  IT DOES!
YOU'RE SEEING YOURSELF  REPRESENTED HERE IN THREE  DIMENSIONS. WE CAN LOOK FOR PATCHES OF YOUR  SKIN AND LOOK AT  MICROFLUCTUATIONS IN THE BLOOD UNDERNEATH YOUR SKIN. HERE YOU CAN SEE WE'VE ZOOMED IN  YOUR FACE AND WE CAN SHOW IF  YOU'RE NEUTRAL OR SMILING.
TELL YOU WHAT, MICROSOFT,  INSTEAD OF READING MY FACE, WHY  DON'T YOU JUST READ MY HAND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FWLO NO NEED TO ZOOM IN! I'M TELLING YOU TO (BLEEP) OFF! WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I EVER  ALLOW A MACHINE THAT CAN MONITOR  MY EVERY THOUGHT AND MOVEMENT INTO MY HOME?
RESEARCHERS AT CORNELL  UNIVERSITY-- GO BIG RED-- SAY  THEY'VE CREATED A ROBOT THAT CAN TELL WHEN YOU WANT A BEER AND  THEN POUR SAID BEER FOR YOU.
THAT ROBOT IS EQUIPPED WITH  THE KINECT DEVICE, THE SAME  THING ON THE XBOX 360.
WELL, LET ME BEGIN BY  APOLOGIZING TO MICROSOFT ABOUT  THE MIDDLE FINGER THING. BECAUSE THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF  PRIVATE INFORMATION I WON'T GET  TO TO BE SERVED A BEER BY A  ROBOT! BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. ARE ARE BEER BUTLER IT IS BEST  TECHNOLOGY HAS TO OFFER?
SOME 30 YEARS FROM NOW WE  MIGHT BE LIVING THE LIVES OF  JAMES CAMERON'S "AVENUE CAR." THAT'S THE DREAM OF RUSSIAN  MULTIMILLIONAIRE DIMITRI ITS OF. HE'S STRIVING TO PROLONG LIFE BY  UPLOADING THE HUMAN BRAIN INTO  HOLOGRAMS OR ANDROIDS.
WELL, THAT'S REALLY COOL  UNTIL YOU THINK ABOUT IT. NOW, WHO DECIDED THIS CRAPPY  GENERATION IS THE ONE THAT  DESERVES TO LIVE FOREVER? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IF THIS AVATAR TECHNOLOGY  EXISTED 80 YEARS AGO IT WOULD BE A BUNCH OF GIANT BLUE RACISTS  RUNNING AROUND AND I'M PRETTY  SURE AVATAR STROM THUR MONDAY WOULDN'T BE OKAY WITH PRESIDENT  OBAMA! TO ME THE FACT WE ALL EVENTUALLY  DROP DEAD IS NOT A BUG, IT'S A  FEATURE! IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE RID OUR  SOCIETY OF OLD AS (BLEEP)S! NEW GUY?
John: THANK YOU, LEWIS. LEWIS BLACK, LADIES AND  GENTLEME
