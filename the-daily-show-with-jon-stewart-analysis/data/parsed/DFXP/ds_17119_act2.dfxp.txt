Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO, YOU KNOW, SUMMER IS HERE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE TO DO. GET A FEW FRIENDS OVER. A COUPLE OF BEERL. HAVE A LITTLE BARBECUE AND MAKE THEM GIVE ME MONEY.
MITT ROMNEY IS IN PARK CITY, UTAH TONIGHT HOSTING A RETREAT FOR A SELECT GROUP OF WEALTHY REPUBLICAN DONORS.
INCLUDED ON THE LIST ROMNEY'S BUNDLERS, INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE  RAISED ABOUT $250,000 EACH.
Jon: WHOA! THAT IS THE JAUNTY EXUBERANCE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAS FOLKS GIVING HIM $250,000. I MEAN, $250,000. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. HE'S INVITING THEM ALL TO LIKE A PARTY. THERE HAVE TO BE AT LEAST 15 OR 20 PEOPLE ON THAT LIST.
700 REPUBLICAN HEAVY HITTERS HAVE JOINED MITT ROMNEY IN PARK CITY UTAH THIS WEEKEND.
Jon: 700. I HOPE THEY'RE JET POOLING. WOW. HOW DO YOU ENTERTAIN THAT MANY HIGH ROLLERS? WELL, THE ANSWER IS WITH A PRIVATE SHOW OF OLYMPIC SKI JUMPERS HURDLING OFF RAMPS AND  DOING FLIPS INTO A GIANT SWIMMING POOL. ARE WE SURE THEY WERE OLYMPIC SKI JUMPERS AND NOT JUST POOR PEOPLE BEING THROWN OFF A MOUNTAIN? BECAUSE A RETREAT LIKE THIS, IT COULD GET REAL HUNGER GAMESY REAL FAST. YOU KNOW, THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS UTAH HO-DOWN: SCHEDULING. BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND NOT ONLY DID THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION HOLD ITS BEVERLY HILLS  SUMMER BASH -- OH, IT'S DRAFTY IN HERE -- THERE'S A GROUP WHOSE  BOARD INCLUDED SHELDON WHO SAID HE COULD GIVE $120 MILLION TO ROMNEY.
THERE'S ANOTHER CLOSED-DOOR MEETING IN SAN DIEGO HELD BY TO CONSERVATIVE SUPER DONORS  BILLIONAIRES CHARLES AND DAVID COKE. THEY RUN THE POLITICAL ACTION GROUP AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY AND HAVE PLEDGED TO RAISE $400  MILLION TO HELP PUT ROMNEY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
Jon: A SAN DIEGO CONVENTION FOR BILLIONAIRE CONSERVATIVES, A CON-CON. THAT'S JUST ONE WEEKEND OF REPUBLICAN FUND RAISING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, LOOKING PRETTY ROUGH FOR THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN. I HOPE HE'S GOT A SECRET WEAPON
ON THE OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN WEBSITE BARACK OBAMA DOT-COM THEY SUGGEST, HEY, IF YOU'RE  GETTING MARRIED, WE HAVE AN IDEA. IN LIEU OF PRESENTS, JUST ASK YOUR GUESTS TO GIVE A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.
Jon: YOU'RE [BLEEP]. I THINK I SEE WHY THE PRESIDENT CHANGED HIS VIEW ON GAY MARRIAGE. HE NEEDS THE WEDDING PRESENTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT
