Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELL  COMPANY TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. LAST SHOW OF 2012 AND  OBVIOUSLY IF THE MAYANS ARE  CORRECT--   (LAUGHTER)  LAST SHOW. OUR GUEST TONIGHT MY NIECE  KRISTEN LEIBOWITZ WILL BE  JOINING US-- I'M SORRY,  STEWART. SHE MUST HAVE CHANGED IT. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY,  BOY, THAT 12-12-12 CONCERT  LAST NIGHT, EVERYBODY THAT MUCH WAD, EVERYBODY THAT  PARTICIPATED, EVERYBODY THAT  SAYS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT BOYD THE SPIRITS OF  EVERYBODY THERE. IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH  THE DISCUSSION OF MARRIAGE. AS YOU KNOW MARRIAGE IS  UNDER ATTACK. SO MUCH SO THAT OUR CONGRESS  PASSED A DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE  ACT. AND PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED  IT INTO LAW BECAUSE IT WAS  THE '90s AND EVERYTHING WAS  IRONIC. (LAUGHTER)  THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT  PROTECTED MARRIAGE FROM THE  SCOURGE OF NO FAULT DIVORCE AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITY AND  FAMILY CARE ISSUES THAT PUT  SO MUCH STRAIN ON  MARRIAGE-- I'M KIDDING. IT WAS ABOUT GAY PEOPLE. IT PROTECTED MARRIAGE FROM  GAY PEOPLE. IN FACT, GAY PEOPLE ARE  CONSIDERED SUCH A THREAT TO  MARRIAGE THAT IN ADDITION TO A FEDERAL DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT MANY STATES  HAVE ENACTED CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENTS BANNING THE PRACTICE, INCLUDING OUR MOST  POPULOUS STATE, CALIFORNIA. AND OUR MOST RELUCTANT TO  FINALLY REPEAL INTERRACIAL  MARRIAGE BANS, ALABAMA. THEY DID IT IN THE YEAR 2000,  ROLL TIDE OF HISTORY. BEFORE YOU GET TOO SMUG ON  ALABAMA REMEMBER THE SUPREME  COURT DIDN'T EVEN TURN IT OVER UNTIL 1967 SO [BLEEP] US. BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. I MEAN THE SUPREME COURT IS  TO THE GOING TO GET INVOLVED  IF GAY MARRIAGE.
SAME-SEX COUPLES ARE  FINALLY GETTING THEIR DAY IN  COURT. THIS TIME THE U.S. SUPREME  COURT JUSTICES HAVE DECIDED  TO HEAR TWO CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO FEDERAL AND  STATE LAWSMENT ONE CASE  INVOLVES THE FEDERAL DEFENSE  OF MARRIAGE AGO OR DOMO. THE OTHER IS A CHALLENGE  TOICAL CALL'S PROP 8.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, I  CANNOT BELIEVE HE MANAGED TO  SQUEEZE A REPORT IN BEFORE  PROM. SECOND OF ALL--   (LAUGHTER)  SECRETARY OF ALL, SECRETARY  OF ALL AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE SUPREME  COURT IS GOING TO RULE ON  GAY MARRIAGE WHICH BRINGS TO US THE LATEST INSTALLMENT IN  OUR LONG RUNNING SERIES,  LGBTQ WATCH [BLEEP] JUST GOT REAL HE --. IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW  BIG A DEAL THIS COULD BE FOR  GAY MARRIAGE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE  ULTIMATE DEFINITIVE  DETERMINATION.
AND THAT COULD RESULT IN  WHAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE 9  ROE V. WADE OF GAY RIGHTS.
Jon: SO IT WILL BE  SETTLED. I MEAN WHO ARGUES ABOUT  ABORTION ANY MORE. (LAUGHTER)  REMEMBER THOSE DAYS? TODAY? THIS AFTERNOON? (LAUGHTER)  I'M SURE THE OPPONENTS WILL  FIGURE OUT SOMETHING LIKE  SURE, YOU CAN GET GAY MARRIED BUT FIRST ONE OF YOU  HAS TO HAVE A TRANSVAGINAL  ULTRASOUND. ONE OF YOU DOES HAVE A  VAGINAL WE CAN TRANS, DON'T  YOU? (LAUGHTER)  NOW THIS IS VERY CRAFTY CASE  FOR GAY MARRIAGE PROPONENTS  TO BRING TO THE SUPREME  COURT. AS THE CASE SETS IT IS A BIT  OF A TRAP FOR CONSERVATIVES.
THE DOMO CASE CONSIDERS  WHETHER SOMEONE LIVED WITH A  DOMESTIC PARTY FOR 35 YEARS SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ESTATE  TAXES WHEREAS HAD THEY BEEN  PARRIED AS HUSBAND AND WIFE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY  ESTATE TAXES.
Jon: THERE'S THE QUESTION,  CONSERVATIVES, YOU CAN  ELIMINATE THE ESTATE TAX FOR A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE BUT  ONLY IF YOU LET THEM GET GAY  MARRIED. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S A VERITABLE REAGAN'S  CHOICE. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? (APPLAUSE)  GAY MARRIAGE OR DOUBLE  TAXATION. GAY MARRIAGE OR DOUBLE  TAXATION. OBVIOUSLY THE POSITIONS ON  THIS ISSUE HAVE BEEN WELL  STAKED OUT. PROPONENTS OF GAY PAERJ SAY  THEIR UNIONS ARE DESERVING  OF THE SAME DIGNITY, RESPECT AND RIGHTS AS THOSE OF  STRAIGHT COUPLES AND ARE  ASKING FOR NOTHING MORE THAN  EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE  LAW. TO WHICH THEIR OPPONENTS  SMARTLY ARGUE --
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO ASK  YOU THIS QUESTION.
GO ON.
IF THE SPACE DON'T LOVE,  CAN THREE PEOPLE LOVE EACH  OTHER. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THREE  PEOPLE TO GENUINE LOVELY  OPEN AND WANT TO SHARE THEIR  LIVES TOGETHER.
Jon: OH MY GOD, OH--   (LAUGHTER)  OH MY GOD! NO! NO WAY! NO WAY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IS LINDSAY GRAHAM  ABOUT TO PROPOSE TO McCAIN  AND LIEBERMAN? (LAUGHTER)  IMAGINE LIEBERMAN'S  RESPONSE.
I'M THE HAPPIEST MAN. I'M IN A THREEWAY TIE FOR  BRIDE. (LAUGHTER)  ACTUALLY, LINDSAY GRAHAM IS  PAGE THE AGE-OLD SLIPPERY  SLOPE ARGUMENT.
I MEAN IF GAY PEOPLE CAN  GET MARRIED WHY CAN'T THREE  PEOPLE GET MARRIED OR TEN PEOPLE, OR ANYBODY TO  ANYTHING. AGAIN, PLACING GAYNESS INTO  THE CATEGORY OF WHIMSICAL  DESIRE FOR SOMETHING  UNCONVENTIONAL AS OPPOSED TO A STATE OF BEING WHO YOU ARE. GOING UP AGAINST THE SUPREME  COURT, THESE GUYS ARE GOING  BUY SOME [BLEEP] SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT.
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA  WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS  ABOUT HIS LEGAL WRITING.
A STUDENT ON MONDAY ASKED  WHY SCALIA IN PAST WRITINGS  HAS COMPARED SODOMY LAWS TO LAWS ON BEASTIALITY AND  MURDER.
Jon: SCALIA! GOOD OLD SLIPPERY SODOMY  SLOPE SCALIA. RUFF LAUGH AKA ANTONIN, AKA  LIPS MANLIS FROM THE DICK  TRACY MOVIE. TOTALLY A PAIRING, YOU SEE  ON ONE OF THOSE WEB SITES  WHERE THE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE OTHER PEOPLE. AND THEN YOU CLICK ON IT. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, ANOTHER STANDARD  BULL [BLEEP] SLIPPERY SLOPE  ARGUMENT. DON'T WORRY I'M SURE ANTONIN  SCALIA HAS A MUCH MORE-- OF  EXPLAINING IT.
IT IS A FORM OF ARGUMENT  WHICH IS CALLED A REDUCTION  TO THE ABSURD.
IF WE CAN TO THE HAVE  MORAL FEELINGS AGAINST OR  OBJECTIONS TO HOMOSEXUALITY, CAN WE HAVE IT AGAINST  ANYTHING?
I'M SURPRISED YOU WEREN'T  PERSUADED.
Jon: YEAH. I AM SURPRISED YOU AREN'T  PERSUADED, GAY STUDENT WHO  ASKED WHY I CATE IS HIS LOVE LIFE WITH MURDER. NO WONDER SCALIA NEVER LETS  HIMSELF BE RECORDED. NOW THE COURT WON'T HEAR  ARGUMENTS ON THE MATTER  UNTIL THE SPRING. AND PROBABLY WON'T DECIDE  UNTIL NEXT SUMMER. YOU GUYS BETTER HURRY IT UP. BECAUSE I HEAR NEW YORK IS  THINKING OFLYIZING THIS ♪ I  NOW PRONOUNCE YOU--  ♪  ♪ (APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? IF WE AS A CULTURE HAVE NO  OBJECTION TO PRIESTS SINGING--   (LAUGHTER)  WHAT IS TO STOP THEM FROM  MURDER? (LAUGHTER)
