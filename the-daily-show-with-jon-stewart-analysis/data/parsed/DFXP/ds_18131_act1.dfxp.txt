Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON  STEWART WHO IS ON TOUR WITH HIS  JAZZ QUARTET. THOSE GUYS CAN BLOW. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW  MOVIE THE SPECTACULAR NOW  ACTRESS SHAILENE WOODLEY IS WITH  US. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BUT WE BEGIN WITH AN EVENT AS  SHOCKING AS IT WAS DEPRESSINGLY  PREDICTABLE. YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT LAST WEEK  WE COVERED FORMER CONGRESSMAN  ANTHONY WEANER AND THE FACT THAT HE WASN'T JUST RUNNING FOR MAYOR  OF NEW YORK CITY BUT LEADING IN  THE POLLS. WELL, SINCE THEN, THERE HAS BEEN  A BIT OF A KOCH-UP IN HIS  CAMPAIGN.
TWO YEARS AFTER A TAWDRY SEX  STING SCANDAL CHASED HIM FROM  CONGRESS, ANTHONY WEINER IS BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS AGAIN. TURNS OUT HE CONTINUED SENDING  LEWD MESSAGES AND PHOTOS TO AT  LEAST ONE WOMAN EVEN AFTER HE WAS FORCEDDED TO RESIGN FROM  CONGRESS.
John: HE DID IT AGAIN? WHY DID HE EVEN NEED TO DO THAT? WHO DID HE THINK HAD POSSIBLY  NOT SEEN HIS PHOTO FROM LAST  TIME? DID HE THINK THAT A WOMAN MIGHT  HAVE BEEN IN A COMA DURING THE  FIRST GO-ROUND? AND NEEDED TO BE DROPPED IN. SO TWO YEARS AGO THIS PHOTO  CAUSED A SCANDAL THAT COST HIM  HIS POLITICAL CAREER. AND JUST AS HIS POLITICAL CAREER  WAS BEING RESURRECTD, THIS NEW  PHOTO... DEAL WITH IT. YOU JUST SAW THAT. YOU CANNOT UNSEE WHAT YOU JUST  SAW. NOW, AMERICA IS COLLECTIVELY  EXPERIENCING DEJA-EWWWWWW. ALTHOUGH THIS TIME THERE ARE  SOME AWESOME DEVELOPMENTS. AND HERE IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE  ONE.
NEW ALLEGATIONS THAT HE KEPT  ON SEXT-ING UNDER THE ALIAS  CARLOS DANGER. (LAUGHING).
John: YES. YOU HEARD RIGHT. HE CALLS HIMSELF CARLOS DANGER. ANTHONY WEINER ALTER EGO IS A  BOLIVIAN ACTION HERO SLASH PORN  STAR. DANGER IS MY USER NAME. ♪ DANGER, DANGER ♪♪
John: YOU MIGHT THINK THAT  ANYONE CAUGHT IN A SITUATION  THIS MORTIFYING WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO JUST WITHDRAW FROM  THE MAYORAL RACE IMMEDIATELY,  BUT YOU DON'T KNOW CARLOS.
FORMER CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY  WEINER SAYS A NEW SCANDAL WILL  NOT STOP HIS CAMPAIGN TO BECOME NEW YORK CITY MAYOR. HE WILL BE OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN  TRAIL LATER TODAY.
John: WOW. THAT MAN HAS GOT BALLS. AND A PENIS. THAT HE CLEARLY CAN'T CONTROL. BY THE WAY, A FUN FACT THERE. AS THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IS WHAT  ANTHONY WEINER CALLS THAT LINE  OF HAIR FROM HIS BELLY BUTTON TO HIS... (LAUGHING). [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE BROUGHT ALL OF THIS ON YOU. IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT OF THE  DEGREE TO WHICH HE HAS LEARNED  NOTHING FROM HIS PREVIOUS SCANDAL, HE'S MANAGING TO HANDLE  THIS ONE WITH EVEN LESS CLASS. AT LEAST IN 2011 HE EXPRESSED  SHAME AND REGRET. AT YESTERDAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE,  THERE WAS A DIFFERENT TONE.
ARE YOU READY TO GO? GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS IS ANTHONY WEINER  DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR  OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK. I HAVE SAID THAT OTHER TEXTS AND  PHOTOS WERE LIKELY TO COME OUT. TODAY THEY HAVE.
John: HOLD ON. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'RE SPINNING THIS BY SAYING,  SEE, I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG. I MADE A PROMISE THAT THERE WAS  MORE SLEAZE OUT THERE AND I'M  MAN OF MY WORD. WEINER, 2013. BY THE WAY JUST A QUICK SHOUTOUT  TO THE GUY BEHIND THE CUBICLE  FOR GIVING THE WHOLLY VENT THE GRAVITAS OF A GAME OF... THERE  ARE TWO MEN IN THAT PHOTO WHO  HAD THEIR HEADS POP OUT AT INAPPROPRIATE MOMENTS. I CAN DO THIS ALL NIGHT. AND I'M GOING TO. LOOK, THIS IS OLD. THIS IS ALL A LOT OF FUN. THE PROBLEM IS, NEW YORKERS HAVE  TO VOTE FOR A MAYOR IN 48 DAYS. SO WE NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG AGO  CANDIDATE WEINER FELL OFF THE  DICK WAGON AND WHETHER WE CAN TRUST HIM AT ALL TO GET BACK ON  IT.
SOME HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION,  WHERE DOES THIS FIT IN, A TIME  LINE OF THE CONTINUUM OF THE  RESIGNATION. SOME OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED  BEFORE MY RESIGNATION. SOME OF THEM HAPPENED AFTER THE  RESIGNATION. THE RESIGNATION WAS NOT A POINT  IN TIME THAT WAS NEARLY AS  IMPORTANT TO MY WIFE AND ME AS THE CHALLENGES IN OUR MARRIAGE.
John: IT'S A TIME LINE ISSUE. IT'S A TIME LINE ISSUE. IF YOU HADN'T CHOSEN --  CHOSEN -- TO RUN FOR MAYOR, IT  WOULD ONLY BE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE. BUT FOR THE REST OF US, THE TIME  LINE MEANS EVERYTHING. SO LET'S REVIEW. IN JUNE OF 2011, AFTER WE WERE  ALL INTRODUCED TO YOUR PENIS --  WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE. WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE INTRODUCED. YES, TECHNICALLY IT WAS STILL IN  ITS WRAPPER, BUT NONETHELESS WE  MET HIM. FINALLY, AFTER A BUNCH OF  NONSENSE ABOUT YOUR TWITTER  ACCOUNT BEING HACKED, YOU ADMITTED THAT IT WAS YOU AND  THEN YOU TELL US THIS.
THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DO  IS MAKE SURE THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS  NEVER EVER HAPPENS AGAIN.
John: RIGHT. AND THAT IS WHERE YOU DREW THE  PENIS IN THE SAND. NEVER EVER HAPPEN AGAIN. AFTER THAT, YOU RESIGNED. YOUR TIME MOVES ON. YOUR BULGING JUNK THANKFULLY  SLIPPING INTO EVERYONE'S PAST. AND THEN IN JULY 2012, YOU AND  YOUR FAMILY EMERGE IN PEOPLE  MAGAZINE WHERE YOU CLAIM TO BE A CHANGED MAN. TIME MOVES ON TO THIS PAST  APRIL.
BACK IN APRIL WHEN WEINER  ANNOUNCED CANDIDACY FOR NEW YORK  MAYOR HE SAID MORE ALLEGATIONS COULD EMERGE.
IF ROTTERS WANT TO GO TRY TO  FIND MORE, I CAN'T SAY THAT  THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER PICTURE.
John: AND THAT'S OKAY. AS LONG AS ANY PICTURES THAT  EMERGE DATE FROM BEFORE HIS  PLEDGE TO STOP SEXT-ING. IN JUNE, 2011B.C. WHICH MEANS  BEFORE CONFESSION OR BEFORE [BLEEP], WHICHEVER YOU PREFER,  WHICHEVER YOU PREFER. SO WHEN YESTERDAY THIS  EMERGED... (LAUGHING)... IT WAS  A PROBLEM. BECAUSE LOOK. LOOK AT THE DATE. LOOK AT WHEN HE SENDS THESE  PHOTOS.
WEINER SAID HE CONTINUED  SENDING INAPPROPRIATE MESSAGES  TO YOUNG WOMEN LONG AFTER RESIGNING IN THE SCANDAL TWO  YEARS AGO.
ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE THE  RELATIONSHIP STARTED JUST ONE  WEEK BEFORE THIS PEOPLE MAGAZINE PROFILE OF HIM AND HIS FAMILY  RAN WITH THE HEADLINE, "I FEEL  LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON."
John: AND THAT IS WHY YOU  HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] UNLESS, UNLESS, UNLESS IN HIS  DEFENSE, UNLESS WHAT YOU SAID "I  FEEL LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON" YOU MEANT FROM MY WIFE. I FEEL LIKE HAVING A DIFFERENT  PERSON FROM THE ONE YOU SEE  FORCING A SMILE NEXT TO ME IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH. SO THE DISGUSTING DETAILS OF  THIS STORY ARE A PROBLEM FOR  WEINER, BUT THEY'RE ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE NEWSIES TRYING  TO COVER THEM.
MOST OF THE EXCHANGE IS TOO  GRAPHIC FOR NETWORK TELEVISION.
John: YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT HERE'S THE THING. WE'RE NOT ON NETWORK TELEVISION. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS BASIC CABLE, MY FRIENDS. AND SURE WE MAY BE BLEEPD BUT WE  WILL NOT BE EMBARRASSED OR  SILENCED. WHAT I'M ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO  READ THESE EXCHANGES I'M NOT  PHYSICALLY ABLE TO DO IT. THEY'RE JUST TOO REVOLTING WHICH  IS WHY WE HAVE A SPECIAL  COMPUTER TEXT-TO-VOICE MACHINE. THE PERVERT-TRON5000. READ THE FIRST UPSETTING TEXT  MESSAGE.
I START TO [BLEEP] SO HARD. YOUR [BLEEP] ALMOST HIT YOU IN  THE FACE.
John: HOW IS IS THAT EVEN  SEXY? THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF  UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT BREASTS  CAN DO. THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE OF  YOUR BOOBS AND SPANK YOU WITH  IT, YEAH. THEN WE GO TO SLEEP SO I LAY ONE  OF YOUR BOOBS ON THE WINDOW SILL  TO KEEP OUT THE COLD AIR. SEXY. AND BY THE WAY, THE MAINSTREAM  NEWS CAN SAY... THEY CAN  ACTUALLY SAY THE WORDS THAT WEINER TEXTED. THEY'VE ALREADY SAID ALL OF THEM  JUST NOT IN THE RIGHT HORRIBLE  ORDER.
ARE YOU. PUT ON. SOME SHOES. I WOULDN'T SPREAD YOUR. ASS. SO MY. [BLEEP]. BLEEP. John: YOU DID IT. YOU REPORTED THE NEWS. YOU SAY THE WORDS MORE THAN YOU  EVER KNOW. WHAT IS CLEAR AT THIS POINT IS  THIS IS BEYOND JUST A SERIES OF  JOKES. NO, IT IS IS DEFINITELY ALSO  THAT. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING MORE  SERIOUS.
HE NEEDS TO BE IN CONTINUAL  TREATMENT.
SOME SORT OF COMPULSIVE  BEHAVIOR.
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS  ADDICTIVE ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY.
John: I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT. ANTHONY WEINER DOES SUFFER FROM  A DEBILITATING ADDICTION BUT  IT'S NOT THE ONE THEY'RE THINKING OF. HE'S ADDICTED TO RUNNING FOR  OFFICE. AND IF HE COULD JUST GIVE THAT  UP, HE COULD LIVE A FULL,  PRODUCTIVE LIFE AS AN INTERNET SEX FREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT
