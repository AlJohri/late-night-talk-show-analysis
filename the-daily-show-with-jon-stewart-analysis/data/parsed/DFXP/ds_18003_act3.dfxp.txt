TONIGHT, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE PROGRAM SENATOR RAND PAUL. SIR. [APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. I'M JUST GLAD YOU WEREN'T  BROUGHT OUT HERE BY SHIRTLESS  MEN.
WE SAW THAT. WE CAN'T KNOW THAT WAS  AVAILABLE.
Jon: WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT  METHODS OF BRINGING PEOPLE OUT.
IF I HAD COME OUT THAT WAY, I  THINK IT MIGHT HAVE COME BACK IN  A TV COMMERCIAL.
Jon: IT MAY. THAT'S THE WAY POLITICS WORK. OBVIOUSLY THE BIG DEBATE WAS  TONIGHT. WE TAPED EARLIER. I IMAGINE YOU'RE RUSHING OUT OF  HERE TO SEE THE DEBATE.
I CAN LOOK INTO THE FUTURE  AND I CAN TELL YOU WHO WON THE  DEBATE. AND I'M VERY OBJECTIVE.
Jon: REALLY? TELL ME WHO?
ROMNEY WON. IT WAS AN OVERWHELMING  JUGGERNAUT.
Jon: DID HE UNHINGE HIS JAW  AND SWALLOW ROMNEY WHOLE?
SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE  FUZZY.
Jon: FAIR ENOUGH. THE BOOK IS CALLED "GOVERNMENT  BULLIES" YOU HAVE A FORWARD BY A  CONGRESSMAN NAMED RON PAUL. HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT?
IT WAS TOUGH TO GET. YOU KNOW, BENDING ARMS AT  THANKSGIVING, WORKING ON HIM AND  WE FINALLY GOT HIM.
Jon: FOR YOU, WHAT IS THE  MESSAGE HERE? THE MESSAGE IS GOVERNMENT HAS  BEEN PUSHING PEOPLE AROUND, THAT  NEEDS TO STOP?
KIND OF. THE MESSAGE IS THAT THERE ARE  UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF  WELL-MEANING PEOPLE. THE CLEAN WATERAGE OF 1974 SAYS  YOU CAN'T DISCHARGE POLLUTANTS  INTO THE NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE  U.S. I'M ALL FOR THAT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO DUMP  CHEMICALS IN THE HO RIVER. THERE SHOULD BE A LAW AGAINST  THAT. IT SHOULD STOP. HOWEVER, OVER TIME, WE CAME TO  DEFINE DIRT AS A POLLUTANT AND  WE CAME TO DEFINE NAVIGABLE  WATERS AS YOUR BACK YARD. WE TELL THE STORY OF ROBBIE  WRIGLEY, WHO WAS GIVEN 84 MONTHS  IN PRISON, HAD IN PRIOR CRIMINAL  HISTORY, 84 MONTHS, NO PAROLE, HER DAD GOT TEN YEARS AND HER  DAD'S PARTNER GOT TEN YEARS. THEIR CRIME IS PUTTING CLEAN  DIRT ON DRY LAND IN A  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT THE  GOVERNMENT SAYS IT'S A WETLAND, AND THAT'S INSANE.
THAT WAS THE CASE. THAT WASN'T AN E.P.A. WASN'T THAT A JURY?
IT'S E.P.A. RULES. IT'S E.P.A. RULES AND COURTS  THAT COME UP WITH IT. YOU'RE RIGHT, IT WENT THROUGH A  JURY. SOMETIMES JURORS HAVE MADE  MISTAKES. WE HAVE HAD JURIES PUT PEOPLE ON  DEATH ROW AND IT WAS A MISTAKE.
Jon: I'M NOT SO FAMILIAR  WITH THE CASE, BUT WASN'T THE  COMPLAINT HE WAS FLOODING OTHER  PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS AND WOULDN'T LIKE... THERE WAS A... HE  WOULDN'T STOP AND HE ACTUALLY  WAS CAUSING DAMAGE?
IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING. HE'S CONVICTED UNDER SOMETHING  CALLED THE RICO STATUTE,  ANTI-RACKETEERING THINGS.
Jon: HE WAS RUNNING A DIRT  SYNDICATE.
EXACTLY. THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT'S OUT  OF CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RICO STATUTE  SAYS YOU OWN A PIZZA HUT AND A  15-YEAR-OLD KID IS SELLING  MARIJUANA OUT OF IT, THEY TAKE YOUR HOUSE. AN URBAN KID IN THE MIDDLE OF  THE CITY WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER,  THEY TAKE HIS GRANDMOTHER'S  HOUSE.
Jon: THESE TYPES OF  STORIES, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT  THERE ARE UNINTENDED  CONSEQUENCES OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION, BUT COULDN'T YOU  JUST AS EASILY PUT TOGETHER A  BOOK CALLED "GOVERNMENT HEROES,"  AND...
PEOPLE WOULD BUY THAT?
Jon: IT'S NOT AS GOOD A  STORY, BUT ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF  PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN  IMPROVED OR AN ANECDOTE ABOUT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY  PRIVATE BUSINESS.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WRITING  A BOOK OF FICTION.
Jon: DON'T YOU IMAGINE...
THE THING IS RULES HAVE GONE  TOO FAR. THE ECONOMY IS SUFFERING UNDER  REGULATIONS, A TRILLION DOLLARS  WORTH OF REGULATIONS IS  HAMPERING ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE'RE GROWING AT 1%. ECONOMISTS SAY THAT A MILLION  PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK BECAUSE  OF REGULATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY. WE'VE GONE TOO FAR.
Jon: WE'VE GONE TOO FAR  SOUNDS LIKE AN ARGUMENT. I WOULD AGREE THAT REGULATIONS  NEED TO BE LOOKED AT IN A MORE  COMMON SENSE WAY, BUT THE  ARGUMENT IS ALWAYS FRAMED AS FREEDOM VERSUS TYRANNY WHICH IS  WE NEED TO MANAGE THIS BETTER.
HOW ABOUT RAW MILK? SHOULD WE PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR  SELLING RAW MILK?
Jon: YOU'RE TALKING TO A  JEWISH GUY WHO IS ALLERGIC TO... I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE HOMOGENIZED  MILK.
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DEBATING  O'REILLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN  YOUR GLASS.
Jon: STICK AROUND. "GOVERNMENT BULLIES"
