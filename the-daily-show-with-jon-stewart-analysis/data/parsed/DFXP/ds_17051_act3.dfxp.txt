NICE TO MEET YOU (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HOW ARE YOU.
I'M VERY WELL, THANK YOU.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS, ANOTHER UNBELIEVABLY TERRIFIC PERFORMANCE.
UNBELIEVABLE, IT'S ALWAYS A REALLY SCARY THING TO SAY ABOUT FILM. YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SAY SHE WAS INCREDIBLE.
Jon: YES, WELL, I DON'T, I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT.
I SAW A POSTER SOMEBODY SAID THEY WERE INCREDIBLE IN THE FILM WHICH I THOUGHT WAS  KIND OF SCARY, UNBELIEVABLE IS ALL RIGHT.
Jon: DO YOU TAKE-- DO YOU KNOW YOUR HEART WHEN YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. IS IT DIFFICULT TO KNOW, ARE THERE TIMES YOU COME OUT AND PEOPLE PRAISE YOU AND I  THINK ACTUALLY NO I PHONED IT IN ON THAT ONE, OR IS THERE --
YEAH, YEAH, NO, I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF IT.
I TRY AND KIND OF, YOU KNOW, STEAR CLEAR OF ANYBODY WHO HAS GOT AN OPINION, REALLY.
Jon: NOW HOW DO YOU-- BECAUSE IT'S HARD. THE THING IT IS STUFF I-- TOUGH I THINK OF BEING AN ACKER IS YOU DO THE BEST  AND YOU BUT YOU DON'T CONTROL THE EDIT. YOU HAVE TO REALLY TRUST THE DIRECTORY PUT YOUR BEST WORK OUT THERE YES.
YEAH, ALTHOUGH I HAVE A HABIT OF PRODUCING AND I HAVE PRODUCED THIS ONE TOO, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN BE AROUND TO KIND OF GET THE GNARLLY BITS OUT.
Jon: THAT'S VERY SMART.
YEAH.
Jon: WHAT IF, AND THIS IS JUST FROM MY EXPERIENCE AS AN ACTOR, WHAT IF EVERYTHING  YOU'VE DONE IS A GNARLY BIT.
IS NATURALLY.
YOU JUST GO BANKRUPT AND YOU NEVER RELEASE THE FILM.
Jon: THAT IS THE MISTAKE I'VE MADE IN MY ACTING CAREER.
YEAH.
Jon: I'VE HAD MY FILMS RES RELEASED. HAVE YOU DIRECTED SOME AS WELL.
NO.
Stephen: .
Jon: IS THAT SOMETHING WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY.
NO, NO, NO SKRZ WHAT IS --
NO, NO,.
Jon: SO YET.
NO.
Jon: SO THAT'S A MAYBE.
NO.
Jon: SO YOU ARE SAYING WOULD YOU LIKE TO DIRECT.
POSSIBLY, PROBE POSSIBLY, NO, NO, REALLY NOT IN ANY SENSE. I'M TOO LADY-- LAZY BY FAR, NO REALLY.
Jon: SO YOU PRODUCE THE MOVIE, YOU ACT IN THE MOVIE BUT DIRECTING, THAT IS WHERE  YOU DRAW THE LINE.
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.
Jon: WHAT IS IT ABOUT DIRECTING THAT IS SOP MUCH MORE STRENUOUS.
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT KIDS, I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE DIRECT MOVIES WITHOUT KIDS.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT I DO, I WORK VERY HARD, YOU JUST DON'T SEE THEM.
OKAY.
Jon: BUT THEN WHEN THEY GET OLDER, YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF. THAT'S HOW MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR GENERATIONS.
HOW OLD ARE YOU YOUR KIDS.
Jon: MY KIDS ARE --
YOU CAN REMEMBER?
Jon: NO, THEY'RE 7 AND ALMOST 6.
OH, WOW.
Jon: HOW OLD ARE YOU YOURS.
I'VE GOT TWO THE SAME AGE, 14.
Jon: I WOULD THINK WOULD YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE AT THAT POINT.
NO, THEY'RE GREAT. THEY'RE REALLY-- .
Jon: I FEEL LIKE 14 IS THE ABLE WHERE EVERYONE SAYS THEY TURN ON YOU.
IT'S NONSENSE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS ABOUT. THAT IS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SELLING DRUGS TO PARENTS.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
YES OR TO THE KIDS EITHER.
Jon: MY CHILDREN ARE LITTLE AND I'M ALREADY TAKING THEM.
YOU HAVE A HANDY HABIT BY THE TIME ARE YOU 14.
Jon: I CAN'T IMAGINE AN AGE, 7 AND 6 THEY TILL HAVE THAT INCREDIBLY INNOCENT ENTHUSIASM.
YEAH.
Jon: BUT THE SARCASM HAS NOT --
HASN'T COME IN.
Jon: THEY WOULD NEVER SAY TO ME LIKE YEAH, THE ZOOK, NICE IDEA, [BLEEP] LIKE THERE'S THAT PURITY STILL OF SPIRIT.
YEAH.
Jon: THAT I FEAR IS GOING TO GO AWAY. AT 14 DO THEY STILL HAVE SOME OF THAT.
NO, YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SCOTTLAND AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN A  TREE AND THEN THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM.
Jon: ALL RIGHT HERE IS MY PROBLEM. IS APARTMENT IN JERSEY. SEE THAT WAS-- WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT --
SARCASM AROUND EVERY CORNER.
Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE. HAVE YOU DONE SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR, ARE YOU A DISCIPLINARY, MORE FRIENDLY  WITH THEM, HOW DO YOU GET IT SO THAT THEY DON'T GO GET OUT OF MY ROOM.
NO, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I I DON'T KNOW.
Jon: DOW SMOKE POT WITH THEM?
THEY SMI I AM-- THINK I'M REALLY DIM WHICH IS A GOOD LOOK FOR A PARENT. THEY COME PAT YOU ON THE HEAD AND THEY SAY, AND THEN YOU CAN KIND OF CONTROL THEM REMOTE CONTROL.
Jon: I HAVE THE SECRET NOW. ACT DUMB, PRETEND ARE YOU THEIR FRENCH BULL DOG.
YOU HAVE ALMOST GOT TWINS WHICH SAY GOOD THING BECAUSE THEY WILL VERY SOON, DO THEY  ALREADY THINK THEY RULE YOU?
Jon: THEY DO ACTUALLY.
IT'S REALLY GOOD, KEEP THAT GOING BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN, YOU KNOW, MANAGE THEM.
Jon: I FEEL LIKE IT WILL BE ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE I'M PRETENDING THEY  RULE ME AND ONE DAY MY WIFE AND I GO YOU KNOW, THEY ACTUALLY RULE US. IT'S A LITTLE FRIGHTENING. BUT NOW WE KNOW. I'M SORRY WE DON'T HAVE MORE TIME TO TALK BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN S IN THE  THEATRES NOW. SEE IT. AND THEN MOVE YOUR FAMILY TO A TREE IN SCOTLAND. WHICH I THINK IS THE ANSWER. TILDA SWINTON, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
