Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR WHOSE LATEST BOOK, "HOW WE GOT TO NOW: SIX INNOVATIONS THAT MADE THE MODERN WORLD." IT WILL ALSO BE A SIX-PART SERIES ON PBS IN OCTOBER. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, STEPHEN JOHNSON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
AH, MY PLEASURE.
Jon: HERE'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS, IT'S AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO TALK ABOUT HISTORY IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T DO.
RIGHT.
Jon: THAT IT'S NOT LINEAR. IT LOOKS AT IT FROM A MACRO PERSPECTIVE.
YEAH, WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WITH BOTH THE SHOW AND THE BOOK IS TO START WITH THESE BASIC OBJECTS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED IN THE MODERN WORLD, LIKE A GLASS OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER.
Jon: YES.
RIGHT? WE ASSUME WE CAN JUST GO OVER TO THE SPOUT AND GET WATER AND IT WON'T KILL US WITH CHOLERA OR TYPHOID 48 HOURS LATER, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
MOST OF US DO.
AND YET, BEHIND THAT ORDINARY OBJECT, THERE'S A 500-YEAR OF HISTORY OF INNOVATIONS AND IDEAS AND CREATIVITY THAT CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND ALL THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE INNOVATIONS. AND IT'S JUST A , NORMALLY WE TELL HISTORY IN TERMS OF GREAT MILITARY LEADERS OR PRESIDENTS OR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE HISTORY OF ALL THESE OBJECTS IS IN A WAY JUST AS INTERESTING, I THINK.
Jon: AND ALSO NORMALLY, YOU WOULD SEE IT AS A CHRONOLOGY AND YOU MAKE THE CONNECTIONS AS IT GOES ON. BUT WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT IS IT'S LAID OUT SORT OF ELEMENTALLY, COLD, LIGHT, YOU KNOW, WATER.
YEAH.
Jon: AND YOU ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT A SCIENTIST BUILDS EXACTLY ON THE LINEAR DISCOVERY RIGHT BEFORE HIS, BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THAT WAY.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. AND THERE ARE ALL THINGS WE DON'T THINK ABOUT AS PROBLEMS. SO, WE'VE GOT A CHAPTER AND AN EPISODE ON TIME AND CLOCKS.
Jon: YES.
SO UNTIL THE LATE 1870s, EVERY TOWN IN AMERICA WAS ON ITS OWN TIME. SO YOU WOULD BE ONE TOWN IT WOULD BE 8:55, YOU'D GO TWO TOWNS OVER IT'D BE 8:57, THREE TOWNS OVER THE OTHER WAY IT'D BE 9:03.
Jon: NO ONE SYNCHRONIZED THE WATCHES.
NO ONE WOULD SYNCHRONIZE, AND THE THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT IT IS NO ONE EVEN NOTICED THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY NEED TO KIND OF BE THAT COORDINATED IN TERMS OF TIME. AND THEN THE RAILROADS CAME ALONG. AND SUDDENLY PEOPLE WERE LEAVING ONE TOWN AT THIS TIME, SHOWING UP AT ANOTHER TOWN THIRTY MINUTES LATER AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIME EXCEPT THE RAILROAD THEY WERE ON WAS ACTUALLY ON BALTIMORE TIME. AND SO THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT TIME IT WAS ANYMORE. IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY CONFUSING. AND SO SOMEONE HAD TO INVENT STANDARDIZED TIME ZONES AND COORDINATE ALL THE CLOCKS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. AND WE DON'T, I MEAN, WE NEVER THINK OF STANDARDIZED TIME AS SOMETHING THAT WAS EVEN AN INVENTION.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT ACTUALLY THERE WAS A PERSON WILLIAM  ALLEN THAT CAME UP WITH IT. AND WHAT IT MADE POSSIBLE IN THE NEXT CENTURY IS THIS, RIGHT? YOU CAN'T SAY TUNE IN --
YOUR TiV0, YOUR D.V.R.
YOU CAN'T SAY TUNE IN AT 11:00 P.M....
Jon: RIGHT.
EASTERN TIME FOR A SHOW OR A RADIO PROGRAM WITHOUT STANDARDIZED TIME.
Jon: RIGHT. EVEN NOW WITHIN, AS YOU SEE THE DISPARITY BETWEEN CULTURES, THERE ARE CULTURES STILL THAT CANNOT TAKE FOR GRANTED A GLASS OF COOL, CLEAN WATER.
YEP. ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK WE REALLY, IT'S IMPORTANT IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WE CELEBRATE THE INNOVATORS THAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE. RIGHT? WE CELEBRATE INNOVATION ALL THE TIME IN OUR SOCIETY BUT IT'S ALL FOCUSED ON THE 25-YEAR-OLD BILLIONAIRE OR THE NEW APPLE GADGET AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE GREAT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD AT LEAST SOLVED THIS KIND OF PROBLEM ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE. WE TELL THIS STORY ABOUT THIS GUY ELLIS CHESBROUGH WHO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 19th CENTURY LIFTED THE CITY OF CHICAGO. IT WAS BASICALLY CHICAGO WAS SO FLAT THAT IT WOULDN'T DRAIN PROPERLY AND SO ALL THIS WASTE WAS JUST KIND OF ACCUMULATING, AND SO HE HAD THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD JUST USE JACK SCREWS --
Jon: WOULDN'T THEY JUST PUT IT, DIDN'T THEY USED TO JUST PUT IT IN THE RIVER, RIGHT?
THEY PUT IT IN THE RIVER.
Jon: THEY PUT IT IN THE RIVER.
BUT THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET IT TO THE RIVER.
RIGHT.
AND YOU HAD LIKE PIGS GOING AROUND AND SCAVENGING. THAT WAS THE LIKE WASTE REMOVAL SYSTEM.
Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
LIKE THESE KIND OF RANDOM PIGS. SO HE FIGURED OUT IF WE COULD JUST LIFT ALL THE BUILDINGS AND ALL THE STREETS TEN FEET WE'LL ACTUALLY GET A NICE LITTLE SLOPE THAT WILL ALLOW THE WASTE AND EVERYTHING TO FLOW INTO THE LAKE WHICH WAS ITSELF A KIND OF PROBLEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO HE DID THIS WITH JACK SCREWS.  HE LIFTED UP AN ENTIRE HOTEL AT ONE POINT WITH PEOPLE STAYING IN THE HOTEL AND THEY WOULD MOVE THE BUILDINGS AROUND AND IT WAS JUST THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING. AND WHEN YOU WALK AROUND CHICAGO TO THIS DAY YOU'RE TEN FEET ABOVE THE NATURAL LEVEL OF THIS CITY BECAUSE OF THIS BRILLIANT GUY FROM 160 YEARS AGO.
Jon: WHAT IF I WERE, LET'S SAY I'M A DIFFERENT BRILLIANT GUY THERE AND I GO LIKE, LET'S MOVE... (LAUGHTER)
RIGHT, RIGHT RIGHT. YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: BUT EVEN WHEN THEY DID THAT, SO ALL THE WASTE WENT INTO THE LAKE AND THAT WAS APPARENTLY UPSTREAM AND SO THEY HAD TO REVERSE, DIDN'T THEY HAVE TO REVERSE THE RIVER?
YEAH. THAT WAS THE NEXT GREAT ENGINEERING PROJECT THAT THEY DID.
Jon: AND THEY REVERSED THE RIVER?
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS PART OF THE POINT IS THAT WE HAVE, WE HAVE A WHOLE SET OF PROBLEMS NOW THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE WITH COMPARABLE INGENUITY, BUT WE NEED TO BE KIND OF REMINDING OURSELVES OF THIS HISTORY AND CELEBRATING THIS. I MEAN, PEOPLE WHO FIRST CHLORINATED THE WATER.
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE WAS A GUY NAMED JOHN LEAL WHO INTRODUCED CHLORINE INTO THE WATER IN NEW JERSEY, ACTUALLY, AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS INSANE.
Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME.
RIGHT. I MEAN, CHLORINE IS POISON IF YOU DRINK IT, YOU KNOW, KIND OF --
Jon: NOT IN NEW JERSEY.
EXACTLY. IT'S REFRESHING!  (LAUGHTER) BUT HE ENDED UP CONVINCING EVERYBODY THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO KILL BACTERIA IN THE WATER AND IT CUT INFANT MORTALITY AND CHILD MORTALITY HALF IN 30 YEARS.
Jon: RIGHT. YEAH IT'S INCREDIBLE. AND WHEN YOU THINGS SEEM DAUNTING AND YOU REALIZE THEY'VE BEEN DIGESTED, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND  I THINK IT DOES GIVE YOU OPTIMISM.
YEAH.
THAT INGENUITY HAS A THING THERE. IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLE BOOK. AND IT'S SOMETHING, LIKE WATCH THE SHOW TOO WITH YOUR KIDS. BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO TOGETHER AND THE WAY THAT IT'S LAID OUT IS REALLY FASCINATING AND ITS A WONDERFUL THING TO DO TOGETHER AND VERY ENTERTAINING THING AS WELL. HOW WE GOT TO BE NOW, IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES SEPTEMBER 30th. PBS SERIES PREMIERES OCTOBER 15th AT 9:00 P.M. EXCELLENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, STEVEN!
THANK YOU.
