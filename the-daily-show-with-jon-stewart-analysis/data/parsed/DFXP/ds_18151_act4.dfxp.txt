Jon: HE THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW HOW HE CHANGED HIS ACT, SO I OPENED FOR LENNY, IN THE CATSKILLS AT KUSHERS, THIS WAS GOT TO BE 20, 25 YEARS AGO, SEE EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO WENT THERE ARE EMBARRASSED. I OPENED FOR LENNY IN THE  CATSKILLS AT KUSHER'S AND YOU HEAR-- I SAW THAT, IT WAS TERRIBLE. HE DID THE SAME ACT BUT INSTEAD OF YELLING PLAY MAESTRO PLAY, HE HAD THEM YELL GO CRAZY, LENNY, GO CRAZY. IT WAS THE ONLY CHANGE BECAUSE ITS WITH A CLASSIC BIT.
YEAH, AND IF YOU CAME TO CATCH A RISING STAR EARLY, BEFORE THE SHOW WOULD START, BELZER WAS ALWAYS THE EMCEE. AND IF THE STAGE WAS COVERED WITH PLASTIC, YOU WENT OH, LENNY GOING ON? AND HE HAD THIS ROUTINE, IT WAS A DIET THAT YOU DON'T EAT THE FOOD, YOU APPLY IT TO THE PART OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT. SO HE STRIPPED DOWN, I'M TELLING IT YOU, HE WAS 6'3" 230 AND VERY HAIRY. TAKES OFF, HE'S IN A SPEEDO. AND IF ARE YOU IN THE FRONT ROW WITH A COCKTAIL IT'S LIKE-- COULD YOU BACK UP, BUDDY, BACK THEM ALL UP, JUST BACK-- SO THEN HIS WIFE AGAIN WOULD PLAY SOME SORT OF MUS-- OH, IT WAS MORE-- AND THEN HE WOULD SAY SO IF YOU HAVE A FAT ASS CAKE IS GOOD FOR THAT. AND HE WOULD TAKE A PIECE OF CAKE AND HIT IT THERE. AND THEN SO AT THE END OF THIS THING HE'S COVERED WITH FOOD AND SHE PRESSES A THING AND YOU HEAR SINATRA SINGING "MY WAY" AND HE'D STAND UP COVERED WITH CREAM AND GET A STANDING OVATION.
Jon: ALWAYS, KILLED, ALWAYS KILLED.
FOR THOSE OF US IN THE BAR LABORING, DO YOU THINK THIS IS-- THE APPLAUSE THERE, THE ROSH HASHANAH JOKE-- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT, HE'S STANDING UP WITH CAKE ON TOP OF HIS HEAD. HE USED TO GO ON THE ROAD WITH BLACK SABBATH. HE WAS VERY-- VERY BIG. AND THEN HE HAD THE CHICKEN, THE CRAZY CHICKEN THING. THOSE WERE GREAT DAYS.
Jon: I DO FIND THAT YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T EVER, AND YOU EVEN WRITE ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOK THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY BECOME A COMEDIAN UNTIL YOU ALLOWED YOURSELF TO BOMB. UNTIL YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH THE SILENCE. AND I KNOW THAT THAT SOUNDS COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT IT CHALLENGES YOU TO MOVE PAST THE INSECURITY THAT PROBABLY DROVE US TO THIS BUSINESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
YES.
Jon: TO GET TO SOMETHING INTERESTING.
YES.
IT'S VERY TRUE. AND WE WERE TALKING BEFORE THE SHOW. ONE OF MY, THE DEANS OF COMEDY MANAGERS WAS, AND STILL HE'S 96 NOW, GREAT MAN NAMED JACK ROLLINS, AMAZING GUY. JACK DISCOVERED WOODY ALLEN, ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER, GOT WOODY FROM BEING A JOKE WRITER TO A PERFORMER THEN TO THE GREAT DIRECTOR AND AUTEUR THAT HE IS TODAY STILL AT 77 YEARS OLD, MAKING A MOVIE EVERY YEAR.
EVERY FOUR MONTHS.
EVERY-- UNBELIEVABLE. SO JACK HAD DUKE ELLINGTON'S EYES, THESE BIG SAD EYES AND HE REALLY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE WAS A COMIC'S MANAGER. HE LOOKED MORE LIKE HE WAS SOME SORT OF ECCENTRIC ENGLISH PROFESSOR AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE OR SOMETHING.
Jon: THERE WAS A SOPHISTICATION.
HE REALLY DID. BUT HIS SHOULDERS, BUT HE HAD TERRIBLE DANDRUFF SO HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS AN ADMIRAL OR SOMETHING. HE HAD LIKE EPAULETTES OF DRY SKIN. BUT ANYWAY HE CAME TO SEE ME. THAT NIGHT AT CATCH, JON, I DESTROYED THE 20 MINUTES THAT I HAD, JUST KILLED. BUT WHAT I HAD WAS A CONVERSATION WITH HOWARD COSELL AND MOHAMMAD ALI, I'M THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME. I'M ANNOUNCING TODAY, I GOT NEW RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, FROM NOW I WANT TO BE KNOWN AS IZZY IZKOWITZ, IT'S JEWISH BOXING. YOU DON'T HIT THE MAN, YOU JUST MAKE HIM FEEL GUILTY, JEWISH BOXING.
Jon: IT WORKED. AND I AM HE WOULD SAY THEN HEIM THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME. SO --
AN I HAD ALL THESE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. REMEMBER WHAT'S THE STORY, JERRY, REMEMBER THAT, THOSE COMMERCIALS. SO I DID THAT GUY ABOUT NIXON AND THE PHLEBITIS THAT HE HAD IN HIS LEG, SAY YOU WANT THE CLOT TO MOVE.
THE TOM CARVEL, ALL THAT.
SUNDAYS, WEDNESDAYS.
FROM YOUR LOCAL CARVEL DEALER, BUY ONE GET ONE FREE. I HAVE THE MOST DISGUSTING VOICE ON TELEVISION. AS I'M TALKING TO YOU, I'M DROOLING IN THE VANILLA. FATHER'S DAY IS COMING BUY DAD THE TIE CAKE, IT'S THE SAME MOLD AS THE WHALE CAKE. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT FROM ME, WE HAVE ONE MOLD. ACTUALLY IT'S STILL WORKING WELL. SO I AM JON, I JUST, AND I WAS A BRAND-NEW GUY, I WAS BRAND-NEW, LIKE A COUPLE MONTHS INTO IT AND I GOT A TIGHT 20. HE TAKES ME OUT AFTERWARD. I FORGET, THE GREEN KITCHEN. SITS ME DOWN AND I'M WAITING TO HEAR HIM SAY TO ME, I'M GOING GIVE UP WOODY. I'M SIGNING YOU, KID. HE SAID TO ME I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT YOU DID TONIGHT AND I'M READY TO JUST STAB HIM, YOU KNOW, WHY? WHY? AND I'M TRYING TO SMILE BUT INSIDE I'M --
HE SAID BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO SAFE, ALL THOSE THINGS WERE GOOD, BUT THEY'RE TOYS AND GAMES, YOU NEVER ONCE SAID I. YOU NEVER ONCE TOLD ME HOW YOU FEEL. YOU'RE A MARRIED MAN. YOU HAVE AN 18 MONTH OLD BABY, TELL ME WHAT THAT'S LIKE, TELL ME WHAT THIS IS LIKE. DON'T BE AFRAID TO BOMB. AND YOU GOT TO LEAVE A TIP. YOU DIDN'T LEAVE A TIP. AND I AM LOOKING AT THE TABLE GOING WHAT DO YOU MEAN. NO I A TIP, IT'S A LITTLE EXTRA THING ABOUT YOU THAT THE AUDIENCE REMEMBERS WHEN YOU LEAVE. THEY LOVED YOU BUT THAT WAS CHINESE FOOD. YOU DON'T REMEMBER YOU WHAT ATE AFTER YOU ATE IT, IT WAS DELICIOUS BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER. LEAVE A TIP. COME IN TOMORROW, DON'T DO ANY OF THIS STUFF. BE PREPARED TO BOMB. AND I DID. BUT I GOT BETTER. AND THAT'S STILL THE BEST ADVICE, ANY COMEDIAN EVER TALKS TO ME AND COMES UP TO ME AND SAYS LORD CRYSTAL--YOU WRITE A BOOK, YOU GET TO LORDSHIP, CAN YOU-- ANY ADVICE, I'M SURE IT HAPPENS TO YOU ALL THE TIME.
I DON'T TALK TO PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER)
IS THAT, DON'T WORK SAFE, DON'T WORK SAFE.
THAT'S THE TITLE OF THE NEXT BOOK.
DON'T BE SAFE.
IT'S TRUE.
YOU WALK A TIGHTROPE EVERY NIGHT.
THIS IS BASIC CABLE.
NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE BEST AND FUNNIEST SHOW ON TELEVISION BECAUSE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
YOU KNOW I SAY THAT.
BUT IT'S INTERESTING, PEOPLE WILL SAY LIKE YOU KNOW, LIKE GOING OFF TO DO THE MOVIE THEY SAY WHY ARE YOU GOING OFF TO DO MOVIES. AREN'T YOU WORRIED IT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD. AND I'M LIKE, YEAH, I'M WORRIED EVERY DAY THAT THIS LUMP IS SOMETHING WEIRD. THAT'S MY LIFE IS WORRY. BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS GET INTO THE BUSINESS IS THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE YOU THAT YOU NEED TO GET OUT. AND EXPRESS. BUT YOU CAN'T, YOU CAN'T STOP. YOU CAN'T BE SAFE EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL SECURE IN SOMETHING.
VERY TRUE.
YOU HAVE TO KEEP GOING WITH THAT FEELING OF LEAVING SOMETHING ELSE, AND JUST KEEP, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP MOVING, I FEEL LIKE.
AND LISTEN. I WROTE THIS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS APPROACHING MY 65th BIRTHDAY.
YOU DON'T LOOK A DAY OVER 65.
4 (LAUGHTER)
AND TALK ABOUT DANGEROUS TERRITORY.
YEAH.
BUT THAT REALLY OPENED ME UP TO WRITE ABOUT DEATH IN A VERY FUNNY WAY AND IN A MOVING WAY. BUT IT EMBRACES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE GO THROUGH. SO FOR ME IN WRITING A BOOK I WASN'T JUST FUNNY APPROACH, IT'S I THINK WHAT PEOPLE RESPOND TO IS THE HONESTY.
AND YOU PUT YOUR HEART OUT THERE, YOUR SHOW, THE 700 SUNDAYS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S YOUR HEART. AND YOU'RE UP THERE PERFORMING THAT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS FOR I THINK ESPECIALLY A COMEDIAN WHERE WE DON'T TRAFFIC IN EARNEST EMOTION VERY EASILY. I KNOW THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO WITHOUT FEELING LIKE YOU GOT TO STOP AND  GO-- YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME. YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU JUST, IT'S AN INSTINCT SO, IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU BE ABLE TO STRADDLE BOTH WORLDS LIKE THAT.
MY FAVORITE MOMENTS ON STAGE EVER HAVE BEEN WITH 700 SUNDAYS. YOU SAW THE SHOW. AND WE'RE COMING BACK TO BROADWAY IN NOVEMBER FOR PROBABLY THE LAST RUN OF THIS.
RIGHT.
BECAUSE I WANT TO DO ANOTHER ONE THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT. BUT WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT WHEN I DO THE SHOW IS NOT THE LAUGHS. THOSE SORT OF I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET. IT'S WHEN THEY'RE QUIET THAT YOU GO OH, I GOT THEM. AND THAT'S THE-- WHEN YOU CAN MOVE THEM THAT WAY AND DON'T LOSE THE LAUGHS WITH IT THEN THAT'S-- THEN TO ME, THEN I'VE DONE SOMETHING I'M REALLY PROUD OF EVERY NIGHT.
THAT'S AWESOME. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU. STILL FOOLIN' EM. ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, BILLY CRYSTAL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
