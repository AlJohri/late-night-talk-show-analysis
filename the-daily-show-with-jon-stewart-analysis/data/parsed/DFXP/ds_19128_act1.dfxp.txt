FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE'VE GOT A GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING TONIGHT. THIS IS INTERESTING. THE GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERY EXCITED, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE ON OUR PROGRAM TONIGHT. SHE'S HERE. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING, THOUGH, SHE IS HERE SOLELY FOR ONE REASON: TO PUBLICLY AND DEFINITIVELY DECLARE HER CANDIDACY FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SHE... TONIGHT... NO. I THINK. [LAUGHTER] IF NOT, THIS IS AN ABJECT FAILURE. IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN -- MY CAREER AS A JOURNALIST MAY BE OVER. BUT, LET'S GET TO OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT, AMERICA'S IMMIGRATION CRISIS KID EDITION.
SINCE OCTOBER, 52,000 UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PICKED UP TRYING TO CROSS INTO THE U.S.
WHAT'S DRIVING THESE PEOPLE NORTH IS CRIPPLING POVERTY AND OUT-OF-CONTROL VIOLENCE IN PLACES LIKE HONDURAS, GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR.
Jon: WOW, THERE ARE KIDS IN TROUBLE. YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT BY MY PARENTS TO FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE. WHENEVER YOU SEE KID IN TROUBLE, YELL AT THEM IN A LANGUAGE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
GO HOME!
NOT OUR KIDS. NOT OUR PROBLEM.
IF OBAMA LIKES THEM SO MUCH, LET THEM STAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT IS AN INTERESTING SUGGESTION. ALTHOUGH A GROWN MAN INVITING THOUSANDS OF KIDS TO HIS HOUSE GIVES OFF A LITTLE BIT OF A NEVERLAND RANCH VIBE. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. SO LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE THESE COUNTRIES DEVELOPED PROBLEMS OVERNIGHT. WHY THE SUDDEN KID-SPLOSION?
REPUBLICANS POINT TO THE PRESIDENT'S 2012 ORDER THAT PROTECTS SOME CHILDREN FROM DEPORTATION, BUT THAT APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE WHO ENTER THE UNITED STATES BEFORE 2007.
Jon: [BLEEPED]. IF I HAVE TOLD KIDS FLEEING VIOLENCE AND POVERTY ONCE, I'VE TOLD THEM A THOUSAND TIMES. IMMIGRANT MINORS SEEKING ASYLUM POST-2007 MUST APPLY AT THEIR CONSULATE WITH FORM N-400 AND A BIOMETRICS FEE. THEN APPEAR FOR A SERIES OF PROCESSING INTERVIEWS TO ASCERTAIN PRIORITY DETERMINATION UNLESS THEY HAVE FAMILY LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES, IN WHICH CASE THEY FILE FORM I-130. AND THEN YOU FILE FORM DS-260 UNDER YOUR NVC CASE NUMBER UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE SKILLS ATTRACTIVE TO AN EMPLOYER. WELL, DO YOU? DO YOU! CHILD-FLEEING VIOLENCE AND POVERTY, BECAUSE IF YOU DO, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO GO WITH FORM I-140. I MEAN, IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT. CHILD. NOW, YOU MAY BE WONDERING, IF THEY DIDN'T FILL OUT THE FORMS, CAN'T WE JUST DEPORT THESE KIDS? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS WRONG WITH YOU? THESE ARE CHILDREN. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ASK THAT? AND SECOND OF ALL, GOOD QUESTION. [LAUGHTER] WHY CAN'T WE JUST DEPORT THEM.
A 2008 LAW SIGNED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAYS CHILDREN FROM COUNTRIES NOT BORDERING THE U.S. CANNOT BE IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED.
Jon: STUPID LIBERALS. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHY WE NEED A REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND...OH. WELL, SINCE WE APPARENTLY HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE, WHY ALL THE HULLABALOO?
THEY CAN APPEAR IN COURT AND MAKE THE CASE FOR STAYING.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF UNDOCUMENTED AND OFTEN UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN ARE OVERWHELMING FEDERAL FACILITIES.
Jon: WELL, OF COURSE, THE AGENTS AT THE BORDER PATROL ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO HELP THESE KIDS.
I'VE WATCHED THEM DO EVERYTHING FROM CHANGE DIAPERS TO HEAT FORMULA. MANY OF THESE ARE SINGLE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD AT THAT, BUT THEY'RE REALLY GETTING BETTER.
Jon: IT'S ALL GOING TO BE DOCUMENTED IN THE NEW HIT MOVIE "THREE MEN AND 50,000 BABIES." [LAUGHTER] STEVE... ONE OF THEM, IS THAT... GUTTENBERG'S BACK, BABY. SO WE GOT OURSELVES A GENUINE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, UNLESS SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO LABEL IT DIFFERENTLY?
THE OLD ENGLISH DICTIONARY DEFINES INVASION AS ANY ENCROACHMENT OR INTRUSION OR ADVENT OF SOMETHING HARMFUL AS IN A DISEASE.
Jon: AH, REPRESENTATIVE LOUIE GOHMERT. HE'S LIKE OLD FAITHFUL, IF INSTEAD OF HOT WATER, IT REGULARLY SHOT OUT STUPID.
IN THE CONSTITUTION UNDER ARTICLE 1 SECTION 8, IT SAYS THAT CONGRESS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CALL FOR THE MILITARY DURING TIMES OF INVASION. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU WANT THE MARINES ON THIS ONE? TIP OF THE SPEAR. ALL RIGHT. NOW, I'M NOT A MILITARY EXPERT OBVIOUSLY, BUT GENERALLY AN ENEMY INVASION FORCE IS NOT PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS UNTIL IT CAN REACH AND OPEN ITS OWN CEREAL. [LAUGHTER] NOW, FROM WHAT I KNOW... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] EVEN HITLER WASN'T ALWAYS AN IMMINENT THREAT. [LAUGHTER] ACTUALLY, THAT'S SOMEONE WHO [LAUGHTER] ACTUALLY, THAT'S SOMEONE WHO WORKS HERE'S CHILD. NO, I KNOW. I'M JUST,  I'M WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN THAT KID, 20 YEARS FROM NOW, JUST HUNTS ME DOWN, COMES TO MY DOOR AND GOES, YEAH, IT'S REAL [BLEEPED] FUNNY. YEAH, THAT WAS REAL, REAL FUNNY. ANYWAY, SO HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, RESPONSE SYSTEM OVERWHELMED. WHERE HAVE WE SEEN THIS BEFORE? THIS UH...ANYBODY, ANYBODY? OH, YOU, FELLOW LONE STAR REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN BLAKE FARENTHOLD?
THIS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S KATRINA.
WELL, I BELIEVE IN THIS CASE IT'S PRONOUNCED KATARINA. ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, WHEN IT COMES TO GLARING GAPS IN WHAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SECURE BARRIERS, I THINK FARENTHOLD KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. IN FACT, OH, MY GOD, HANG ON. THE CRISIS IS SO BAD THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. NOOOOOO! DONDE ESTA? YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BE SO QUICK TO BLAME OBAMA FOR THIS FLOOD OF IMMIGRANTS. MAYBE THEY GOT THE IDEA THAT AMERICA WAS A GREAT PLACE TO COME FROM SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
WE LIVE IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
THE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.
THE STRONGEST, FREEST, GREATEST COUNTRY.
THE GREATEST HEALTH CARE.
THE GREATEST UNIVERSITIES. THE GREATEST SCHOOLS.
THE GREATEST RISE OF FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY.
GREATER THAN SOLOMON'S ISRAEL.
THE SINGLE GREATEST NATION IN THE HISTORY OF ALL MANKIND.
THE GREATEST COUNTRY EVER.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE [BLEEPED] AN APPLE PIE RIGHT NOW. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHY WOULD YOU NOT... WHY WOULD YOU NOT COME TO A PLACE THAT GREAT? IN FACT, IT'S WHY ALL OF OUR ANCESTORS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND WERE THEMSELVES ORIGINALLY UNWELCOME. BECAUSE THAT'S THE STORY OF AMERICA, FROM BEN FRANKLIN'S WORRIES THAT GERMANS WERE RUINING PENNSYLVANIA, TO OUR 19th CENTURY 60-YEAR BAN ON THE CHINESE IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD JUST FINISHED BUILDING OUR RAIL SYSTEM, TO OUR VERY REAL AND JUSTIFIABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE IRISH AND THEIR INSATIABLE APPLYING FOR JOBS. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS WHO HATE THE NEWER IMMIGRANTS. BECAUSE LADY LIBERTY MAY APPEAR TO BE A BEACON TO THOSE YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE, BUT THE TRUTH IS SHE'S ACTUALLY A BOUNCER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
