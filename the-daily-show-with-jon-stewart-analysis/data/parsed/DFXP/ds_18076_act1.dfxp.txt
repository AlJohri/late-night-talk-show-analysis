Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HI, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BIG SHOW TONIGHT. EVA MENDES IS JOINING US. A FINE ACTRESS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AMERICA,  LAND THAT I LOVE. STANDING BESIDE HER I CAN'T HELP  BUT NOTICE SHE HAS ISSUES THAT  NEED ADDRESSES VEESA SEE VIS A VIS ECONOMICS AND PEOPLE IN  GROCERY STORES THROWING MILK SO  THEY CAN SLIP. TAKE THAT MINIMUM WAGE MOP  PERSON THAT HAS TO CLEAN THAT  UP. A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT NEED  FIXING. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STANDING  IN OUR WAY.
THE REPUBLICANS DON'T SEEM TO  GET IT. INSTEAD OF WORKING POUR THE  PEOPLE THEY WOULD RATHER WORK TO  OBSTRUCT.
OBSTRUCTION IS THE ORTHODOX. THEY THINK COMPROMISE SAY DIRTY  WORD.
THE POLICY SEEMS TO BE JUST  SAY NO.
REPUBLICANS HAVE CLOG ORDER  BLOCKED EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED  TO DO.
Jon: YES! BECAUSE OF REPUBLICANS NOTHING  CAN PASS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE  BODY KEEPING AMERICA BACKED UP. [ LAUGHTER ] UNABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT THE  SIMPLEST LEGISLATION SO  BLOATED -- I'M SORRY JUST A  COUPLE DAYS INTO THIS PASSOVER THING AND MY GOD WHAT IS IT  ABOUT MATZAH WHEN IT HITS  STOMACH ACID IT TURNS TO CEMENT. SURE WHEN YOU ARE WANDERING IN  THE DESERT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT  THE NEXT BATHROOM IS GOING TO BE THIS IS MODERN SOCIETY. POINT IS CAN A BROTHER GET A  PRUNE AL MONDAY. SOME BELIEVE GOVERNMENT CAN  HELP.
I REJECT THE VIEW THAT SAYS  OUR PROBLEMS WILL TAKE CARE OF  THEMSELVES, THAT SAYS GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE. THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE  GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE A FORCE FOR  GOOD SHOULD WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE TO REFORM IT SO IT'S  LEANER, MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE  RESPONSIVE FOR THE PEOPLE.
Jon: THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO  A LOT FOR US. WE HAVE TO WHIP IT INTO SHAISM  GET IT BIKINI READY. WAIT A MINUTE,. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I SAID BIKINI READY. THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO FIXING PROBLEMS WHERE DO WE  START?
ANYONE OF US HAVE HEARD WHAT  IT'S LIKE TO KNAVE GATE THE  BROKEN BUREAUCRACY OF VA, THE IMPOSSIBLY LONG LINES OR THE  REPEATED CALLS FOR HELP THAT GET  YOU NOTHING MORE THAN AN ANSWERING MACHINE.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS LIKE 2008. SORRY.
IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS  WAY. NOT IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE'S MANY ASPECTSES OF THE  WAR IN IRAQ THAT HAVE GONE WRONG  BUT CARING FOR THE VETERANS IS ONE THING WE CAN STILL GET  RIGHT.
Jon: BRAVO IT'S THE LEAST  WE CAN DO. FOR THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES  FOR THOSE WHO DEFEND THE  COUNTRY. I FOR ONE AM EXCITED TO HEAR  ABOUT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON  THAT FRONT OVER THE PAST FIVE  YEARS. I'M IN NO WAY EXPECTING TO BE  DISAPPOINTED THAT WE'VE NOT  SOLVED THIS BUT IT'S WORSENED. LET ME REMIND YOU, THIS IS MY  FIRST TIME WATCHING THIS SHOW  AND -- [LAUGHTER] -- SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THE SOUND  BITES WORK.
SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK  OFFICE THE NUMBER OF VETERANS  WAITING MORE THEN A YEAR FOR BENEFITS JUMPED FROM 11,000 IN  2009 TO 24 5,000 THIS PAST  DECEMBER. THAT'S A MORE THAN 2000%  INCREASE.
TODAY NEARLY 900,000 VETERANS  ARE WAITING FOR DISABILITY CLAIM  IT'S BE PROS SESD. THE AVERAGE WAIT, 273 DAYS.
Jon: THAT'S (bleep)  SHAMEFUL. THE V.A. HAS A BACKLOVING  900,000 PEOPLE. McDONALDS HANDLES TEN TIMES  THAT MANY CUSTOMERS IN AN HOUR  AND MAY I REMIND YOU, THEY ARE RUN BY A CLOWN. [ LAUGHTER ] A CLOWN WHO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- I WILL SAY THIS -- IN THEIR  DEFENSE -- A CLOWN WHO ENTIRE  ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN THREATENED BY A VICIOUS CRIMINAL  MASTERMIND. IF ANYONE HAS SPOTTED THIS SO  CALLED HAMBURGLAR OR HIS  HENCHMEN DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE HIM YOURSELF. CALL OUR CRIME TIP LINE AT  8008-BRIAN WILLIAMS HOUSE. [LAUGHTER] I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO  MODERNIZE THE V.A. SYSTEM.
THEY ARE GOING TO COMPUTERIZE  CLAIMS.
97% OF V.A. DISABILITY CLAIMS  ARE ON PAPER IN. IN THE YEAR 201397% ARE STILL ON  PAPER.
Jon: THE V.A. STILL USES  PAPER. I'M A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO STILL  ORDERS HIS CASSETTE TAPES FROM  COLUMBIA HOUSE AND I DON'T EVEN USE PAPER. TODAY I READ A MAGAZINE, PAID MY  BILLS, SENT A LETTER AND FOUND A  RECIPE AND WIPED MY ASS ALL WITHOUT USING PAPER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHICH REMINDS ME -- DOES REMIND  ME, CAN YOU WASH A KINDLE? [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WHAT HAPPENED? WHY HAVEN'T THEY MODERNIZED THE  SYSTEM?
THE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE  ELECTRONIC RECORD CAPABILITY  HAVE BEEN LIMITED BY LONG-STANDING PROJECT  MANAGEMENT, WEAKNESSES,  INADEQUATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND  POOR OVERSIGHT.
Jon: BUREAUCRATIC  INCOMPETENCE, I GET IT, PROBABLY  CAUSED BY THE REPUBLICANS AND THE OBSTRUCTION AND  UNDERFUNDING. COME ON SOUND BITE SUPPORT MY  NOTION. COME ON.
YOU NEED MORE PEOPLE,  PROCESSORS, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS IF YOU  LOOK AT OUR BUDGETS FOR V.A. A  40% INCREASE 20 OUR BUDGET AT A TIME WHEN OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE  GONE THROUGH BELT TIGHTENING.
Jon: REPUBLICANS, THEY MADE  IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE V.A. TO  FIND THE RECORDS UNDER ALL THE MONEY THEY DUMPED ON THE AGENCY. [LAUGHTER] FUNNY STORY. AS IT TURNED OUT THE DEFENSE  DEPARTMENT USES A MEDICAL  TRACKING PROGRAM CALLED AHLTA WHILE THE V.A. USED A SUPERIOR  PROGRAM CALLED VISITA. THOSE TWO -- VISTA. THOSE TWO PROGRAMS -- I SWEAR  IT'S TRUE -- THOSE TWO PROGRAMS  ARE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW INSANE IS THIS COMPLICATION  EVEN THE ANALOGY EXPLAINING WHY  THE TWO COMPUTER SYSTEMS CAN'T WORK TOGETHER IS FUNDAMENTALLY  FLAWED.
LET ME USE THIS ANALOGY, AN  XBOX AND PLAYSTATION CAN PLAY  THE SAME GAME ON THE SAME TV SCREEN BUT THEY DON'T TALKING TO  THE.
Jon: THAT MAKES SENSE BUT  THEY DON'T TALK BECAUSE THEY ARE  COMPETITORS. THEIR MISSION IS TO DESTROY EACH  OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH IS NOT THE RELATIONSHIP WE  EXPECT FROM THE PART OF  GOVERNMENT THAT TAKES CARE OF OUR DISABLED VETERANS AND THE  PART OF GOVERNMENT THAT CREATES  THEM. SO WHILE I GUESS YOU COULD -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- SO I GUESS YOU COULD SPEND A  BILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEARS  TRYING TO GET ONE KID'S XBOX GAMES TO WORK WITH OTHER KIDS  PLAYSTATION GAMES AS OR AS THE  FAMILY PARENT OR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, YOU COULD JUST COMMAND  WE'RE GOING TO USE THE XBOX. THE POINT IS IF YOU ARE MAKING  THE CASE THAT GOVERNMENT HAS A  MEANINGFUL ROLE TO PLAY IN IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVES, THEN  WHEN YOU ARE NOT OBSTRUCTED FROM  DOING WHAT YOU WANT, YOU BETTER (bleep) BRING IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF WE'RE SMART -- AND IF WE'RE  SMART AND TECH LOGICALLY SAVVY  ENOUGH TO CREATE FLYING UNMANNED ROBOTS WITH 1.8GIGAPIXEL CAMERAS  THAT CAN SPOT ENEMIES FROM MILES  AWAY, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COOK UP A NETWORK SPREAD SHEET  PROGRAM WHICH KNOWS WHICH LEG A  SOLDIER HAS LOST WITHOUT HAVING HIM FILL OUT FORM AFTER FORM AND  COMING IN FOR A PERSONAL  OBSERVANCE. OTHERWISE BEFORE LONG THESE GUYS  WON'T
