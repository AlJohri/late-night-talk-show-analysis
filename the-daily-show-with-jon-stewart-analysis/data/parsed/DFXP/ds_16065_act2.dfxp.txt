(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK. JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND, MY SON AND I ARE PLAYING OUR NEW FAVORITE GAME THERE. WE PRETEND TO BE THE HEROIC NAVY SEALS WHO TOOK DOWN AMERICA'S WORST ENEMY, A.K.A., OUR NEIGHBOR'S LABRADOR. THE NEXT THING I KNOW THERE'S A LAWYER AT MY DOOR SERVING ME WITH PAPERS.
WALT DISNEY COMPANY IS IS LOOKING TO CASH IN ON THE OSAMA BIN LADEN TAKEDOWN.
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE THE U.S. MILITARY RAID ON  OSAMA BIN LADEN'S COMPOUND BUT IT TOOK DISNEY LESS THAN TWO DAYS TO REFLECT THE TRADEMARK  FOR THE NAME.
Jon: YOU CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE AMERICA'S REAL-LIFE HEROES AND TURN THEM INTO THIS. ALTHOUGH... BUT THAT IS IS AWESOME. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE HAPPY MEAL. PUTTING A TRADEMARK IS LIKE TRYING TO COPYRIGHT THE GUYS WHO STORMED THE BEACHES OF  NORMANDY OR PUTTING A PATENT PATENT ON PATTON. IT BELONGS TO ALL OF US. NOT TO MENTION DISNEY FILED ITS CLAIM ONLY TWO DAY AFTER THE STORY WAS RELEASED. PART OF OUR NEW ONGOING SEGMENT, THAT WAS FAST. YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE AN IDEA. I'M GOING TO TRADEMARK THE LION KING. OH, IT'S TRADEMARK. THEN I'LL JUST TRADEMARK THE TRADEMARK. YOU USE THAT THING ALL THE TIME? I'M GOING TO MAKE A BOAT LOAD. ALTHOUGH DISNEY ISN'T THE ONLY BIG MEDIA COMPANY MAKING THE MOVES.
FEDERAL REGULATORS TODAY APPROVED THE PURCHASE BY COMCAST OF A MAJORITY STAKE IN  NBC UNIVERSAL FROM GENERAL ELECTRIC. THIS MERGER WILL CREATE A $30 BILLION MEDIA COMPANY WITH CABLE, BROADCAST, INTERNET, MOTION PICTURE AND THEME PARK COMPONENTS.
Jon: THANKED GOD. NOW IF I HAVE MY CABLE GO OUT AND I GO TO A THEME PARK AND CHOKE ON A GIANT FRIED TURKEY  LEG RIGHT BEFORE I FIND OUT MY FAVORITE SHOW GOT CANCELED I ONLY HAVE TO CALL ONE NUMBER  TO COMPLAIN. THIS MONOPOLY IS AWESOME. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN MORE OFTEN. RIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S ILLEGAL. WHICH IS WHY IT HAD TO BE APPROVED BY THE FCC. THE SAME PEOPLE WHO FREAK OUT WHEN BOOBS POP OUT OF A SUPER BOWL OR KEEP ME FROM SAYING  THINGS LIKE (BEEP) OR (BEEP BEEP (. IN FACT, IF I COVER MY MOUTH EVEN JUST SAY LIKE (BEEP) NO ONE KNOWS BUT THEY WILL GET IT  AND THEY WILL BLEEP IT. PART OF THE FCC'S JOB IS MAKING SURE THAT THE MEDIA COMPANIES DON'T GET TOO  POWERFUL OR THEY MIGHT START DOING STUFF LIKE TRADEMARKING THE NAMES OF HEROIC MILITARY  UNITS FOR THEIR OWN FINANCIAL GAMES. THOSE (BEEP). YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE THIS.
THE MERGER WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE COMCAST'S INCENTIVE AND  ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES, BLOCK COMPETITIVE ENTRY, FORCE BUNDLES ON OUR CABLE SYSTEMS  AND DISCRIMINATE COMPETING PROGRAMMING. FOR CONSUMERS THIS WOULD SPELL EVEN HIGHER PRICES.
Jon: EVEN HIGHER PRICES. SO WHAT? I ONLY PAY $150 A MONTH BUT I GET 80 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE STYLE CHANNEL EVEN THOUGH  THAT'S ALL THERE IS ON EVER. EXCEPT OF COURSE MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AT 11:003 ON COMEDY CENTRAL WHERE TV  FUNNY MAN JOHN STEWART PUTS HIS OUTRAGEOUS TONIGHT ON TONIGHT'S NEWS. TONIGHT'S EPISODE JERK-OFF JOKES ABOUT BIN LADEN. HOW HOW DID THIS DEAL HAPPEN? WELL, THE FCC'S FIVE-MEMBER REGULATORY BOARD WORKS KIND OF LIKE THE SUPREME COURT WITHOUT  THE ROBES OR THE LITTLE HAMMERS AND NOT AS MANY PEOPLE DIE WHILE IN OFFICE. THEY VOTED 4-TO-1 TO APPROVE THE MERGER THANKS IN PART TO THE SUPPORT OF FCC  COMMISSIONER MEREDITH BAKER.
SHE VOTED FOR THE DEAL AND HAS SINCE BEEN OUTSPOKEN COMPLAINING THAT THE FCC'S  MERGER REVIEW PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND TAKES TOO LONG.
Jon: GOOD FOR YOU, MADAM COMMISSIONER. CUT TO THE RED TAPE TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY FOR THE AMERICAN TAX PAYOR. FINALLY SOMEONE IN GOVERNMENT WHO IS NOT JUST LOOKING OUT FOR NUMBER ONE.
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSIONER MEREDITH BAKER ANNOUNCED SHE'S RESIGNING NEXT  MONTH TO BECOME COMCAST NBC UNIVERSAL'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS.
