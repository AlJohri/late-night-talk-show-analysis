[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT DOCUMENTARY  FILMMAKER. HIS LATEST FILM IS CALLED "THE  CENTRAL PARK FIVE."
THE LAWYER SAID WE'RE GOING  TO LOSE THIS CASE. WE PLAN TO GET YOU A PLEA DEAL.
I REMEMBER TELLING THEM, YOU  KNOW, YOU GUYS CAN COP OUT, BUT  IF I DID SOMETHING, I WOULD COP  OUT. I WOULD WANT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF  TIME FOR WHAT I DID. IF I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING YOU CAN  GIVE ME THE REST OF MY LIFE IN  PRISON. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT  BACK THEN BUT I KNEW THERE WOULD  BE NO WAY I WOULD COP OUT TO SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE PROGRAM KEN BURNS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO, THIS IS THE STORY OF FAMOUS  CENTRAL PARK JOGGER. FIVE YOUNG MEN IN THE PARK THAT  NIGHT CONVICTED OF THIS REALLY  HORRIBLE CRIME. AND THEY SPENT A TREMENDOUS  AMOUNT OF TIME IN JAIL. AND IT TURNS OUT THEY HAD  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH  IT.
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND A  JUDGE VACATED THEIR CONVICTIONS  AND THE REAL RAPIST CAME FORWARD AND CONFESSED AND HIS DNA  MATCHED THE DNA SAMPLE THAT WAS  AT THE INCREDIBLY BLOODY CRIME SCENE AND NONE OF FIVE BOYS  HADN'T HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH  IT BUT THEY SPENT UPWARDS OF 13 YEARS IN JAIL. THE JUDGE VACATED CONVICTIONS IN  2002 AND THEY NISHITIED A CIVIL  SUIT AGAINST THE CITY OF NEW YORK AS WE WOULD ALL DO AND IT'S  TEN YEARS AND NOTHING HAS  HAPPENED. YOU CAN SEE THE -- IN 1989 BEING  A MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL PARK  FIVE WAS AMONG THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS ON EARTH.
NO QUESTION.
YOU CAN SEE THE HEROISM, THE  ESSENTIAL GOODNESS. IT'S LIKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST. YOU LOOK IN THEIR EYES AND I  DEFY YOU TO LOOK AND SAY -- YOU  CAN GO IN SAYING THEY ARE  GUILTY.
THEY DON'T EVEN NEED US TO GO  IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID  THEY DIDN'T DO IT. HERE SAY SINGULAR PIECE OF DNA  EVIDENCE. IT'S THIS OTHER GUY, WHO BY THE  WAY, SINCE THEY DIDN'T CATCH HIM  FOR THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD HIM WENT ON TO COMMIT OTHER  HORRIFIC CRIMES.
THEY COULD HAVE HAD HIM TWO  DAYS BEFORE AND SOMEBODY FORGOT  TO FOLLOW UP. HE RAPED SEVERAL WOMEN AND  MURDERED A PREGNANT WOMEN. I THINK ALL OF THIS SAY WAY OF  SAYING WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES IN  LIFE. THE JOURNALIST SAYS IT REALLY  DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DO WITH IT. EVERYBODY HAS MED A MISTAKE. THESE GUYS ARE INVESTED IN THIS  MISTAKE AND IT'S 24 YEARS.
IT'S THE PART I AM HAVING  TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH. I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE  INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT MALEVOLENT  INSTITUTIONS THEY DO TRY TO DO THEIR BEST BUT THIS IS SAY CASE  OF MASS DELUSION AND STUB BORN  IN A WAY THAT IS SOCK.
IT'S SHAMEFUL. WE NEED TO PUT A PERIOD ON THIS  INJUSTICE. IT'S NOT JUST THE FIVE. IT'S THE PROSECUTORS AND POLICE  THAT LIVED WITH THIS FOR SO  LONG.
IF YOU ARE NEW YORK CITY WHAT  IS THEIR COMMENT ABOUT THIS? DO THEY SAY, OH, YEAH, NO, IT  WASN'T THEM BUT WE'RE NOT GOING  TO GIVE THEM MONEY BECAUSE WE --
THEY TRY OUT -- THEY HAVE  ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVES DUJOUR. THEY FINISHED OFF WHAT THIS GUY  STARTED OR THEY STARTED WHAT HE  FINISHED OFF. OR WE'VE INFORMATION THAT YOU  DON'T KNOW.
YOU WILL FOLLOW THE DIRECTIVE  THAT THEY WERE GUILTY AND THEY  HAVE TO GO TO JAIL DON'T YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE COURT'S  DIRECTIVE THAT THEY ARE NOT  GUILTY AND THEY WERE WRONGLY  HELD? IF YOU WANT TO BRING CHARGES  AGAINST THEM THAT THEY WERE --
THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT.
THEY WILL NOT DEAL WITH THE  CASE? IT'S A PIPELINE SNMPLEG THEY ARE  SAYING IT'S A NO SETTLEMENT  CASE. THEY'VE DRAWN IT OUT. NORMALLY CASES GET --
PEOPLE TRIP IN NEW YORK CITY  THAT GET A MILLION DOLLARS,  BREAK THEIR NOSE ON A SIDEWALK.
EXACTLY. THIS IS TEN YEARS. THEY SUBPOENAED ALL OF THE  OUTTAKES AND RECORDS.
Jon: OUR OUTTAKES DID THEY  THINK THERE WAS LIKE A BLOOPER  REEL LIKE, ACTUALLY WE DID IT. ACTION. DON'T USE THAT. DON'T USE THAT.
THEY WERE FISHING FOR  INCONSISTENCE SIZ. JOHN YOU SAID YOU ENTERED AT  9:01. YOU TOLD KEN AND ARREST SARAH  AND DAVE.
Jon: THE INCONSISTENCIES  ARE STUNNING. NONE OF GUYS HAD THE SAME STORY. THEY WERE TRYING TO FOLLOW IT  BUT IT WAS CONVOLUME LAWSUITED  FOR THEM.
YOU ARE 14 YEARS OLD YOU ARE  40 HOURS OF INTERROGATION  WITHOUT FOOD AND WATER YOUR PARENTS ARE IN AND OUT AND THE  GUYS ARE SAYING WE KNOW YOU  DIDN'T DO IT. HE IS SAYING HE DID IT AND IT  WAS A CIRCULAR FIRING SQUAD.
Jon: NEW YORK WAS AN UTTER  MESS BACK THEN AND THIS CASE  WAS -- THE MEDIA WAS ON THIS THING LIKE FIRE ON GASO LINE.
THAT'S THE WILDING. THE KIDS WEREN'T WILDING THE  MEDIA WAS WILDING. THIS WAS WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE THAT THE  COPS THOUGHT THESE KIDS MIGHT  HAVE DONE IT ONCE THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEY  CAN'T DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED OR  WHERE IT HAPPENED. THEY ONLY KNOW BECAUSE IT DID  HAPPEN. SUDDENLY THEY SAY WHAT ABOUT  THAT GUY YOU DIDN'T PICK UP. THEY WENT TO SAY IT WAS A SLAM  DUNK.
Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW  THE CITY CAN'T SAY LOOK HOW FAR  WE'VE COME. WE'VE CORRECTED SOME OF THE  SYSTEMIC AND CLASS ORIENTED AND  RACE-ORIENTED DISCRIMINATORY  POLICIES. WE CHANGED IT. TRIED TO DO OUR BEST. LET'S MAKE GOOD WITH THESE GIS  TO SHOW THE DISTANCE WE'VE COME.
JON STEWART FOR MAYOR! THIS IS IT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHY:  LET ME JUST SAY  THIS, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO TAKE  PICTURES OF MY JUNK AND SEND IT TO  EVERYBODY. I DON'T HAVE TO TIME FOR THAT  CAMPAIGNING.
MAYOR BLOOMBERG COULD SAY  REMIND ME AGAIN WHY WE'RE  SPENDING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DEFENDING PEOPLE WHO MADE A  MISTAKE. SAY LOOK, CAN I END THIS. IT RELEASES EVERYBODY. ALL OF US WHO BOUGHT THE STORY. DIDN'T YOU WRING YOUR HANDS?
Jon: YEAH. IT'S A RECONCILIATION WITH WHAT  HAPPENED.
NOBODY HAS TO GO TO JAIL. IT COULD JUST BE WE MADE A  MISTAKE. HOW CAN WE MAKE YOU WHOLE. GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE. THEY ARE IN THE 40s AND LATE  30s AND THEY WERE 14, 15, 16  YEARS OLD. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.
Jon: IT'S ON PBS APRIL 15  AT 9:00 P.M. IF THEY WIN THE LAWSUIT CBS WILL  THROW IN
