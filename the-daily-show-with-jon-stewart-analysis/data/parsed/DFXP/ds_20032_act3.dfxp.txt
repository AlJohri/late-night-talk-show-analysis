(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A LITTLE KNOWN ACTRESS WHO IS DIRECTING AN INDEPENDENT FILM APPARENTLY, HER NEW FILM IS CALLED "UNBROKEN."
WE BEAT THEM BY MAKING IT TO THE END OF THE WAR ALIVE. THAT'S HOW WE DO IT. THAT'S OUR REVENGE.
IF I CAN TAKE IT, I CAN MAKE IT.
PRECISELY.
MY BROTHER PETE USED TO SAY THAT. HE USED TO THINK THAT I COULD DO ANYTHING. HE USED TO THINK THAT I WAS BETTER THAN I AM.
WHO SAYS YOU'RE NOT?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, ANGELINA JOLIE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪ HELLO! HELLO!
HELLO! HELLO, EVERYONE!
Jon: MISS JOLIE, IF I MAY CALL YOU THAT.
MR. STEWART.
Jon: WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE WITH THIS FILM IS WONDERFUL. BUT THIS IS -- THIS IS, I WAS IMPRESSED NOT JUST WITH THE STORYTELLING NOT JUST WITH THE VISUALS,  WITH THE SCOPE. I MEAN, FROM THE WAR SCENES TO THESE INCREDIBLE SCENES IN THE OCEAN, TO THESE PRISON CAMPS. I MEAN, MAN, THIS IS, IT'S EPIC. IT'S A SAGA. I SAY TO YOU.
THANK YOU.
Jon: RESPECTFULLY. RESPECTFULLY.
I'M GLAD. IT WAS -- HIS LIFE IS BIGGER THAN ANY MOVIE WE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE. HE'S AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN, AND IT WAS REALLY AN HONOR.
Jon: LOUIS ZAMPERINI.
YES.
Jon: AND JUST, JUST RUN US A QUICK BLUEPRINT OF HIS LIFE. A QUICK OUTLINE.
OH IT'S SO HARD TO SUM UP HIS LIFE.
Jon: IT'S CRAZY.
HE WAS A TROUBLED IMMIGRANT YOUTH WHO WAS SMOKING AND DRINKING AND STEALING BY THE TIME HE WAS 9, DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. HE HAD A BROTHER PETE WHO SAID YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT, THE KIND OF BROTHER WE ALL WISH WE HAD. HE ENDED UP RUNNING IN THE 19 IN HITLER'S OLYMPICS. HITLER ASKED TO SHAKE HIS HAND EVEN, BECAUSE HE HAD THE FASTEST LAST LAP. ENDED UP AS A BOMBARDIER WHEN HE WAS DRAFTED.
Jon: RIGHT.
END UP CRASHING TWICE, SECOND IN THE OCEAN, 47 DAYS AT SEA. MANY PRISON CAMPS LATER, FACED MUCH ADVERSITY AND AT THE END OF THE DAY HIS STORY IS ABOUT OVERCOMING ADVERSITY AND FINDING YOURSELF AND THE STRENGTH INSIDE YOURSELF. IS THAT GOOD?
Jon: SO, THAT'S THE FIRST ACT. THE FIRST ACT. THE SECOND ACT --
HOW DID I DO? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: OKAY. SO THEN IT REALLY STARTS TO HEAT UP WHEN HE MEETS SANDRA BULLOCK. (LAUGHTER) SO HE LEAVES. WAS IT FOR YOU A CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE CERTAINLY ACTED IN YOUR SHARE OF THESE TYPES OF LARGER, YOU KNOW, MORE EPIC TYPE OF FILMS, BUT TO BE AT THE HELM OF IT, WAS THAT THE BIG CHALLENGE? HAD YOU BEEN AROUND IT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF FOR THAT? OR DID IT TAKE YOU OFF GUARD?
IT TOOK ME OFF GUARD.
Jon: YEAH.
DIDN'T IT TAKE YOU OFF GUARD?
Jon: STILL IS.
IT DID. I REMEMBER WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BEFORE A SHARK ATTACK AND THINKING, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FILM A SHARK ATTACK. EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ME TOMORROW TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS SHARK ATTACK --
Jon: NOW ARE THERE ACTUAL SHARKS IN THERE?
HOW DO YOU, HOW DO YOU EVEN -- NO, I CAN'T SAY.
Jon: YOU CAN'T SAY IF THEY WERE ACTUAL SHARKS?
NO, WE HAD A COMBINATION OF SHARKS, ANIMATRONIC SHARKS, CG SHARKS. BUT THESE THINGS, YOU REALIZE YOU CAN YOU CONVINCE THE STUDIO, YOU SAY, YOU SHOULD GIVE ME THIS JOB, YOU KNOW. GIVE ME THIS JOB. I'LL BE THE BEST PERSON AT THIS JOB. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.
Jon: YEAH.
I'M SO SURE OF IT. AND THEN YOU GET THE JOB AND THEN YOU THINK, OH, MY! I'M NOT SURE I DO. SO EVERY DAY WAS A CHALLENGE. BUT WE HAD A GREAT TEAM AND I THINK WE PULLED IT OFF.
Jon: IS IT MORE FULFILLING? WHICH OF YOU FOUND THAT TOUCHES YOU A LITTLE BIT DEEPER?
I LOVE DIRECTING. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THERE FROM BEGINNING TO END. YOU'RE THERE FOR YEARS OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU'RE SHEPHERDING FROM THE MUSIC TO THE FINAL LITTLE TINY DETAIL OF THE SHARK IN THE WATER AND HOW IT SWIMS AND EVERYTHING, SO IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT YOU GET TO HAVE THAT CONTROL --
Jon: RIGHT. DID THAT EVER STEM FROM -- SO, SO WHEN YOU'VE, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ON THE SET AND YOU HAVE BEEN ACTING AND YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING, BUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT CONTROL AND YOU MIGHT SEE THE FINAL PRODUCT AND THINK, MAN, THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD HAVE GONE, IS THAT WHERE THE DESIRE STEMS FROM IS TO HAVE MORE OF THAT?
I DIDN'T -- WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T PLAN ON BECOMING A DIRECTOR. I WROTE SOMETHING AND THEN I WANTED TO PROTECT IT, SO IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT, I ENDED UP SAYING -- I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO DIRECT IT BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT WAS THE FIRST FILM. AND THIS, I JUST LOVE THE STORY SO MUCH AND I WANTED TO TELL IT.
Jon: SUCH AN AMAZING STORY.
BUT, BUT YES. I OFTEN WITH FILMS, THERE ARE STILL A FEW FILMS OF MINE I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN BECAUSE I COULDN'T --
Jon: THERE ARE FILMS OF YOURS YOU HAVEN'T SEEN?
I COULDN'T, I COULDN'T SIT THROUGH IT.
Jon: DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT THEM BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THEM ALL. FLAP, FLAP, FLAP. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW,  IF YOU HAD ENDED UP WITH ME INSTEAD OF BRAD PITT, OUR PORTMANTEAU STEWART JOLIE WOULD HAVE BEEN STOLIE. WE COULD HAVE BEEN A VODKA BRAND. I'M JUST SAYING, THAT'S MY LAST PITCH. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU, AND CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I HAVE TO TELL YOU, FROM THE MOMENT I MET YOU, I DON'T KNOW, IT HAS TO BE 20 YEARS AGO ON THE SET.
YEAH. AMAZING.
Jon: I ALWAYS THOUGHT, THIS PERSON HAS TALENT COMING OUT OF ALL DIFFERENT AREAS. AND IT'S JUST -- (LAUGHTER) I DON'T MEAN IT THAT WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? (LAUGHTER) YOU JUST YOU MEET CERTAIN PEOPLE AND YOU GO, THIS PERSON EMBODIES SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SPECIAL. LIKE IT'S, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT.
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT ABOUT YOU. IT'S FUN TO BE HERE. BECAUSE WE WATCH THE SHOW, WE WATCH THE SHOW  AT HOME. FOR EVERYBODY AT HOME, IT IS FUNNY TO SIT HERE.
Jon: WHAT IS BRAD USUALLY WEARING WHEN YOU WATCH? I MEAN, IS IT, IF I MAY, DOES HE WATCH,  GENERALLY JUST PAJAMA PANTS, NO TOP?
SOMETIMES.
Jon: YEAH, THAT FEELS RIGHT! "UNBROKEN" IS IN THEATERS ON CHRISTMAS DAY. ANGELINA JOLIE, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
