FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR SHOW IS AMAZING. WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE DOCUMENTARIAN JEHANE NOUJAIM IS ON THE SHOW. SHE'S DONE THIS AMAZING DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY MOVEMENTS IN EGYPT. IT'S INCREDIBLE. YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT. BUT BEFORE WE GO INTO FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OBVIOUSLY THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION PLAGUING THIS COUNTRY. CORPORATIONS:  ARE THEY PEOPLE?
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU DAPPER STRANGER. [LAUGHTER] IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME WAY TO PROVE THAT CORPORATIONS WERE NOT PEOPLE. SHOW THEIR INABILITY TO LOVE. TO SHOW THAT THEY LACK AWARENESS OF THEIR OWN MORTALITY. TO SEE WHAT THEY DO WHEN YOU WALK IN ON THEM MASTURBATING. [ LAUGHTER ] ARE THEY EMBARRASSED? OR LIKE OUR NONHUMAN APE COUSINS DO THEY JUST KEEP PLUGGING AWAY? [LAUGHTER] WHILE EERILY MAINTAINING EYE CONTACT. SERIOUSLY DUDE I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO THE REPTILE HOUSE. THEY ARE ODDLY HUMAN, I HAVE TO SAY. ONE WAY TO DISTINGUISH CORPORATIONS FROM PEOPLE WOULD BE TO SHOW THAT THEY DON'T SUFFER THE SAME CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR ACTIONS THAT WE MERE MORTALS MAY. FOR INSTANCE, LET'S SAY YOU OR I KNOWINGLY SOLD SAY 700,000 BAD MORTGAGES. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S SAY WE KNEW IT BUT WE STILL DUMPED THAT (bleep) ON OTHERS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US? PROBABLY NOT THIS.
BANK OF AMERICA SAYS IT WILL PAY $404 MILLION.
SETTLING CLAIMS RELATED TO A DECADES WORTH OF BAD MORTGAGE LOANS IT SOLD TO FREDDIE MAC.
Jon: I'M SORRY I COMMITTED SYSTEMIC FRAUD FOR TEN YEARS. HOW ABOUT I GIVE YOU A CUT OF IT? IN CORPORATE AMERICA THERE'S A WAY TO COVER UP ANY WRONG DOING.
THAT'S WHAT THE MONEY IS FOR.
Jon: IT'S THAT OLD SAYING DON'T DO THE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T PAY THE NOMINAL FINE.
UBS WILL SETTLE CHARGES IT MISLEAD INVESTORS.
THEY'VE SETTLED A CASE FOR $550 MILLION. IT'S THE LARGEST SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND A CORPORATION. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND JP MORGAN CHASE ARE EXPECTED TO SIGN A $13 BILLION DEAL.
Jon: I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THINKING $13 BILLION THAT'S LIKE MAKING JOHN CARTER 52 TIMES. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW IS JP MORGAN GOING TO COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF SCRATCH.
THEY EARNED OVER $20 BILLION LAST YEAR SO THE $13 BILLION IS AFFORDABLE FOR THEM. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WAS THAT DUDE STARING AT YOU GUYS, TOO? [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. SO LET ME SEE IF I GET. THIS LET ME DO THE MATH. IT'S COSTING THEM 52 JOHN CARTERS BUT THEY EARNED ENOUGH TO MAKE 80 JOHN CARTERS. MONEY WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO COMPREHEND BEFORE WE MOVED TO A JOB CARTER BASED FINANCIAL SYSTEM. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS ANOTHER MARKER THAT DISTINGUISHES PEOPLE FROM CORPORATIONS.
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT UBS DID NOT ADMIT ANY WRONGDOING.
GOLDMAN ADMITTED NO WRONGDOING IN THE PROCESS.
JP MORGAN WILL NOT ADMIT WRONGDOING PER SE.
Jon: SO IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG PER SE IS THE $13 BILLION A GIFT? A DOWN PAYMENT, A TIP, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG BUT YOU ARE A HELL OF A GOVERNMENT THERE HERE IS A LITTLE SOMETHING. HEY, HEY, NICE FRAUD CASE. NOW GO HOME AND GET YOUR (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] JUST IN CASE YOU THINK IT ONLY WORKS FOR FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS IT DOESN'T.
HEALTH CARE MANUFACTURER JOHNSON & JOHNSON WILL PAY MORE THAN $2 BILLION TO SETTLE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS.
Jon: I EXPECT THIS FROM YOU JOHNSON BUT NOT YOU JOHNSON. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, ACI'VE NOT TRUSTED JOHNSON AND, JOHNSON SINCE I TRIED TO STOP MY CHILD'S CRYING BY POURING A BOTTLE OF THEIR PATENTED NO MORE TEARS SHAMPOO IN HIS EYE. DID NOT WORK AT ALL. THERE WERE STILL TEARS AFTER I POURED IT IN THERE. IN FACT, THIS MAY HAVE EXACERBATED THE SITUATION. [LAUGHTER] WHAT COMPLEX CORPORATE SCHEME DID THEY PULL THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ESCAPE FULL PROSECUTION?
THEY BRIBED DOCTORS AND PHARMACIES. THEY GOT THEM TO PRESCRIBE DRUGS PARTICULARLY TO THE ELDERLY, CHILDREN AND THE DISABLED DESPITE HEALTH RISKS OR A LACK OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SHOWING ANY HEALTH BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS.
Jon: HOLY (bleep). THEY KNOWINGLY BRIBED DOCTORS TO GIVE USELESS DRUGS TO OLD PEOPLE, THE DISABLED, AND BABIES. YOU ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO DO THAT IN GRAND THEFT AUTO. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, I HAVE A QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS:
IS ANYBODY GOING TO JAIL?
Jon: THAT WAS THE QUESTION. WE HAVE MORE PRISONERS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. NOT EVEN PER CAPITA, JUST MORE. SO WILL ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP THESE CORPORATIONS BE JOINING THEM?
SOME ECONOMISTS SAY BANK EXECUTIVES SHOULD BE IN HANDCUFFS.
WHY ISN'T SOMEBODY GOING TO JAIL?
ALL I CAN SAY IT'S IN THE HANDS OF FEDERAL PROSECUTORS.
IS IT POSSIBLE SOMEBODY COULD GO TO JAIL.
YES.
Jon: IT'S POSSIBLE. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE I'LL RESIGN TOMORROW TO PURSUE MY REAL PASSION RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS. AM I GOING TO? NO. CORPORATIONS CAN COMMIT FRAUD, MONEY LAUNDERING, BRIBE ENABLED PLACEBO BABY DRUGGING AND MERELY PAY BACK A PORTION OF THE ILL GOTTEN GAINS AS THE PRICE OF DOING BUSINESS. HOW DO PEOPLE FAIR?
THREE STUDENTS PUT IN HANDCUFFS BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR SCHOOL BUS STOP.
WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE BUS AND THEY START ARRESTING US. BU
Jon: YEAH, (bleep) THOSEUS. KIDS.
