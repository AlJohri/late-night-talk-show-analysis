[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO, YOU GOT YOUR RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA, IT'S NOW LEGAL IN COLORADO. WE'VE HEARD HOW POT USE HAS RECENTLY COMBINED WITH TEXTING TO DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES. THERE'S ANOTHER REASON WHY AMERICA SHOULD RECONSIDER THIS LIBERALIZATION OF POT LAW.
POT JUST MAKES YOU DUMB.
Jon: IT JUST MAKES YOU DUMB! IT JUST DOES. IN THE SAME WAY THAT SANTA CLAUS JUST IS WHITE. UNASSAILABLE TRUTHS AND THAT'S NOT ALL THAT POT DOES.
MOST PEOPLE THAT DO SMOKE POT, I WATCH THEIR AMBITION CURTAILED STEADILY AND THEY NEVER REACH THEIR POTENTIAL.
I'M NO ON POT BECAUSE IT'S ADDICTIVE AND LEADS TO SERIOUS DRUGS. WHAT IS TO KEEP SOMEBODY FROM GETTING POTTED UP ON WEED AND GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL?
NOTHING.
Jon: NO, NO THAT IS JUST TOO TASTY. HIT ME AGAIN.
WHAT IS TO KEEP SOMEBODY FROM GETTING ALL POTTED UP ON WEEDROM AND GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL.
NOTHING.
Jon: SAMPLE THAT AUDIO BEYONCE THAT IS -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT POT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE CAN HAVE ITS DOWNSIDE. A RECENT UC SAN DIEGO STUDY FOUND THAT ALCOHOL APPEARS TO HARM THE TEENAGE BRAIN EVEN MORE THAN, AND I'M USING CLINICAL TERMINOLOGY HERE, GETTING POTTED ON WEED. [ LAUGHTER ] SO YOUR ARGUMENT AGAINST MARIJUANA IT WOULD CARRY A LOT MORE WEIGHT IF THE SAME INDIVIDUALS HAD A SIMILAR PERSPECTIVE ON AMERICA'S ALCOHOL USAGE AND GO.
IT'S WINES-DAY, WEDNESDAY, BEST DAY OF THE WEEK.
GREAT JOB GETTING US DRUNK.
IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DRINK IT, PASS IT AROUND.
HAVEN'T HAD A BEER IN EVER.
WOULD YOU LIKE A BEER? > WHERE ARE YOU SPENDING NEW NEW YEAR'S EVE?
I'M GOING GET REAL DRUNK!
Jon: YEAH, I'M GOING TO GET REAL DRUNK! I JUST HOPE I DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM LOSER POTHEADS WHILE I'M GETTING ALL (bleep)ED UP BECAUSE THAT WOULD KILL MY TOTALLY SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE ALCOHOL BUZZ. WE CLEARLY KNOW THAT MARIJUANA IS A DEADLY GATEWAY DRUG FROMNA WHICH NO SANE PERSON CAN HOPE TO ESCAPE. BUT OUR VIEW OF ALCOHOL IS NOT EVEN BENIGN INDIFFERENCE. WHERE MARIJUANA LEADS YOU ALWAYS TO A DARK PATH. HOW DO WE VIEW THE EFFECT OF BEER? ♪  ♪
COORS LIGHT.
Jon: (bleep). BEER IS MAGIC! IT TURNS AN OVERCROWDED SWELTERING CITYSCAPE INTO A BEACH PARTY WHERE SKATEBOARDS BECOME SURFBOARDS AND BUSINESS SUITS BECOME BIKINIS. REST ASSURED THE KIDS WILL NEVER ASSURED THE KIDS WILL BE EXPOSED TO THIS WORLD THAT GLORIFIES ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION UNLESS -- UNLESS THEY WATCH TV. [ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S MILLER TIME. FROST BREWED COORS LIGHT.
MICHELOB ULTRA.
BUD LIGHT.
Jon: THAT IS ONE AFTERNOON OF WATCHING FOOTBALL. IT  GIVES ME CIRRHOSIS OF THE EYEBALLS. I CAN'T SIT DOWN WATCHING FOOTBALL WITHOUT BEING BOMBARDED BY THE HARRY POTTER-ESQUE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF FERMENTED HOPS. NOT THAT THEY AREN'T LOOKING OUT FOR THE KIDS.
PLEASE DRINK RESPONSIBLY.
Jon: SORRY, I COULDN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SNOWING BIKINI PARTY. MAYBE IF POT HAD AS MANY COMMERCIALS AS BEER WE WOULDN'T LET IT WORRY US SO MUCH. IT WOULDN'T BE THAT HARD. YOU COULD YOU USE THE SAME COMMERCIALS. MOST OF THEM BARELY NEED TO BE CHANGED. YOU KNOW THE DOS EQUIS GUY?
HE IS THE MOST INTERESTING MAN IN THE WORLD.
Jon: HE IS JUST AN ACTOR BUT IF YOU GET HIGH, HE WILL BECOME THE MOST INTERESTING MAN IN THE WORLD. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF MARIJUANA. AND, IF I MAY SAY SO, AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR COUCH WILL BECOME THE MOST INTERESTING COUCH. MOST BEER COMMERCIALS COULD EASILY BE RETROFITTED.
BUD.
SMOKE.
BUD.
Jon: THAT ACTUALLY EVEN MAKES MORE SENSE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BUY BEER IF A FROG TELLS YOU TO BUT ONLY WEED REALLY MAKES YOU BELIEVE THE FROG.
