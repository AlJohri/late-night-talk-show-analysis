Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, WHAT A PROGRAM OUR GUEST  DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKERS LORI  SILVERBUSH AND KRISTI JACOBSON. THEY'VE DONE A DOCUMENTARY ON  HUNGER IN AMERICA THAT WILL  ABSOLUTELY ANGER YOU BUT STILL WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING IT HAVE  SOME JUNIOR MINTS OR SOMETHING. JUST TO -- YOU KNOW. YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW  YORK ASSEMBLYMAN, HE TOOK THE  NEW YORK TELEPHONE COMPANY TO TASK FOR SEEMING TO WEED OUT  EMPLOYEES AND TOOK HILLARY  CLINTON TO TASK FOR EMBRACING YASSER ARAFAT'S WIFE. AND YASSER ARAFAT TOOK MEL  GIBSON TO TASK AND ALSO TOOK  RENEE ZELLWEGER TO TASK. TOOK THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER AT AT  HIGH SCHOOL TO TASK. REALLY, REALLY HAITZ  ANTI-SEMITISM. SOME OF THOSE SEEM LIKE AN  OVERREYAK BUT HE FEELS LIKE HE  IS STANDING UP FOR A GROUP WHENEVER HE FEELS THEY ARE  UNFAIRLY MA LINED.
ASSEMBLYMAN DOVE DRESSED UP  FOR A PARTY DRESSED UP IN  BLACKFACE MAKEUP, AN AFRO WIG AND AN ORANGE JERSEY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT?
NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS  BUT THAT IS POORLY DONE  BLACKFACE. HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A  BASKETBALL PLAYER BUT A JEW THAT  WENT ON A CRUISE WITHOUT A HAIR  PRODUCT. WHAT POSSIBLE EXCUSE DO YOU HAVE  FOR DO THIS?
IT WAS PURIM. IT'S WHEN PEOPLE GET DRESSED UP  AND TRY TO LOOK DIFFERENT AND  TRY TO BE DIFFERENT.
Jon: REALLY, PURIM. WHAT IT'S PURIM. EVERYONE KNOWS ON PURIM YOU GET  TO BE RACIST. [ LAUGHTER ] BLACK HISTORY WHAT NOW? I'M SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU. YOU WERE DIGGING A DEEPER HOLE.
ON PURIM PEOPLE DRESS UP AS  ARABS. EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE.
Jon: THAT'S NOT HELPING. IT'S PURIM. YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE BLACK  GUYS, ARABS THE WHOLE (bleep)  THING IS NUTS. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE HE DID ISSUE AN  APOLOGY IN CASE YOU ARE  WONDERING HOW A GUY WHO LOUDLY DEMANDS APOLOGIES EVERY TIME HIS  GROUPS GETS SLIGHTED.
ANYONE THAT WAS OFFENDED I'M  SORRY THEY WERE OFFENDED. IT WAS NOT THE INTENTION. THAT'S REALLY ALL CAN I SAY.
Jon: I'M SORRY TO DISCOVER  SOME PEOPLE ARE CRY BABIES BUT  I'M AN ARE DULT MAN IN NEW YORK CITY AND DIDN'T REALIZE  BLACKFACE WAS OFFENSIVE. WE'RE JERND BY JESSICA WILLIAMS WILLIAMS  ON FLATBUSH AVENUE IN NEW YORK  RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. JESSICA. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
OUTRAGE. JON, IT'S ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF  THE POLITCALLY CORRECT WAR ON  PURIM.
Jon: DID YOU SAY THERE'S A  WAR ON PURIM?
HELL YEAH THERE IS. THIS IS A LOW-DOWN DIRTY STUNT.
Jon: HOW IS THIS A SAME FOR  PURIM.
THE WAY THIS MAN DENIGRATES  PURIM IT'S THE FOURTH OR FIF.
Jon: KEEP GOING.
IT'S THE SEVENth, TENTH  MOST IMPORTANT JEWISH HOLIDAY  THERE IS.
Jon: AROUND THERE.
IT'S TO BE CELEBRATED WITH  COSTUMES AND HEROS IN THE  ANCIENT BADEL.
Jon: RESPECT.
AND HE TRIVIALIZES IT BY  DRESSING UP LIKE A BASKETBALL  PLAYER. AT WHAT POINT DO THE BOOK  OFESTER DO THE HARLEM GLOBE  TROTTERS SHOW UP.

Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE'RE  LOSING THE REASON FOR THE PURIM  SEASON?
YOUR DAMN RIGHT. PURIM IS ABOUT GETTING SO  (bleep) UP THAT YOU COULDN'T  REMEMBER THAT THEY TRIED TO EXTERMINATE THE JEWS. NOW IT'S NOTHING BUT A HALLOWEEN  PARTY FOR THE KIDS. YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY IT ANYMORE. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW IT'S HEY, NICE SUPERMAN  COSTUME. WHAT IS NEXT A. HELL NO, NOT ON MY WATCH  STEWART, NOT IN MY HOUSE.
Jon: SOMEWHERE THERE'S A  RABINNICAL COLLEGE LAUGHING  THEIR ASS AT THINK. WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE OF LUTHERANS  SAYING I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T REALIZE. JESSICA, ALL THIS IS BESIDES THE  POINT. I ASSUME THAT FOR YOU, FOR MANY  BLACKFACE WAS A BIT OF A  PROBLEM.
