[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GEORGE WELCOME BACK. WE ERNLD --
Jon: WE LEARNED ABOUT -- HIS REFUSAL HAS BEEN A DELICIOUS ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET FOR DEMOCRATS. SADLY AS WITH ONE BUFFET THERE'S ONE GUY THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO STOP EATING.
SENATOR REID SAID HE SPOKE WITH A BANE INSIDER WHO TOLD HIM, QUOTE, HARRY HE DIDN'T PAY ANY TAXES FOR TEN YEARS. REID RECOUNTED THE PERSON SAYING, HE DIDN'T PAY TAXES FOR TEN YEARS. NOW DO I KNOW THAT THAT IS TRUE? WELL, I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID REID. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HERE SAY RULE OF THUMB IF YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR CLAIM WITH THE WORDS, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE TRUTH, THEN SHUT UP BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUT A DEAD COCKER SPANIEL ON YOUR HEAD AND YELL ABOUT BIRTH SERTZ WHICH BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S SEGMENT, YOU HARRY, REID ARE -- SHOULD MITT ROMNEY RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? OF COURSE. BUT HIM NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING DOESN'T GIVE YOU LICENSE TO DO THE WRONG THING. YOU ARE THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER YOU CONDITIONED RUN TO THE SIDE BOOB GAZETTE WITH RIDICULOUS SPECULATIONS ABOUT WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN MITT ROMNEY'S TAXES. THAT'S IS THIS SHOW'S JOB. WHEN MITT ROMNEY NEEDS MONEY QUICKLY HE BEATS A SWISS PERSON UNTIL THEY BREAK OPEN. THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DISPROVEN. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. IN A CAMPAIGN SEASON PEOPLE THROW AROUND BASELESS ACCUSATIONS ALL THE TIME. NOT THE WORST THING ANYONE EVER DID. WHAT IS THE WORST THING IS HARRY REID GOING ON TO SPECULATE THAT MITT QUOTE "POOR FATHER MUST BE SO EMBARRASSED ABOUT HIS SON. " CAN WE CHANGE THAT, PLEASE? YES. [ LAUGHTER ] I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU JUST WENT DEAD DAD SHAME ON MITT ROMNEY. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS TRULY AND THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED HIS STILL LIVING FATHER ON MANY OCCASIONS LET ME SAY IT'S A (bleep) SHOT. YOU KNOW WHAT HARRY REID IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO FACT CHECK ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,LY. LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO THIS QUICKLY I HAVE A OUIJA BOARD. CAN I GET IN TOUCH WITH MITT ROMNEY'S FATHER. SPIRITS, NEED TO SPEAK TO ONE KNOWN AS GEORGE ROMNEY, GOVERNOR ROMNEY ARE YOU PROUD OF YOUR -- YES, YES. THERE YOU GO. YES. THANK YOU GOVERNOR. THAT'S ALL THE TIME. WAITING THERE IS MORE. WHY WOULDN'T I BE HE'S A LOVING SON GAVE ME BEAUTIFUL GRANDCHILDREN AND WHO ARE YOU (bleep) HARRY REID TO SUGGEST I'M NOT PROUD OF MY SON. LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT WHEN YOU GO POLTERGEIST ON YOUR SORRY ASS YOU TWO BIT SON OF A -- I HAD NO IDEA HOW PRECISE THEY WERE. REID'S COMMENTS FROM DRAWN OUTRAGE FROM THE LIVING AS WELL.
HOW IRRESPONSIBLE IS IT FOR THE MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT MITT ROMNEY DOESN'T PAY TAXES. IT'S SPECULATION.
NOBODY DOUBLE GETS AND GETS TWO SOURCES ANYMORE. PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT ABOUT PEOPLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES OR NOT AND IT'S NEWS. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: THEY ARE RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] VERONICA AND THE TWO JUG HEADS ARE RIGHT ALTHOUGH GRETCHEN I'M NOT SURE IS THE BEST PERSON TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT CHECKING SOURCES BEFORE SPREADING RUMORS BUT STILL I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE POINT.
IT'S MY POINT THAT YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE SOURCE. PEOPLE SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT IT'S MAINSTREAM NEWS.
Jon: IRONY TOO GREAT. SPIRIT, SHOULD I PLAY THE MONTAGE -- YES! YES!
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S AN OUTREACH TO THE MUSLIM WORLD.
SOME ARE SPECULATING HIS HANDLERS DID WANT HIM TO BOW.
HE WAS OFF THE TELEPROMPTER SO SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S TELLING. SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S A WAY OF CONTROLLING THE MEDIA.
I READ A COUPLE OF BLOGS THIS MORNING THAT WONDER WHETHER OR NOT ERIC HOLDER WOULD LEAVE.
END IT TO US SHOW US THE BIRTH SEMPLET THANK YOU VERY MUCH, STEVE. I APPRECIATE THAT.
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS SAY HEALTH CARE REFORM. OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING, MAYBE ME, THAT THIS IS A SUBTLE FORM OF EUTHANIZEA.
HE MAY HAVE DIES TO THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
THAT'S WHY OUR SHOW IS SO SUCCESSFUL. A LOT OF IT WE SORT OF MAKE UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: TO BE CLEAR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NONE OF THAT MEANS HARRY REID ISN'T TERRIBLE IT MEANS THERE'S LOTS OF TERRIBLE TO GO AROUND. WE'LL BE RIGHT
