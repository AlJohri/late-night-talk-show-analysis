APRIL 11, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, YOUNG RICKY GERVAIS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) SO, WE CAN ALL START TAKING BETS NOW ON WHAT ANIMAL HE'S GOING TO  MIME HAVING SEX WITH. ( LAUGHTER ). MARSUPIAL. ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ). SO, LISTEN, FOLKS, IT'S OVER. RICK SANTORUM, RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVE, THE PENNSYLVANIA PRUDE SWEATER VEST JOHNSON, THE  KEYSTONE ( BLEEP ), ENDED HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN A  HEARTFELT CONCESSION SPEECH YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE WERE TOLD, "FORGET IT, YOU CAN'T WIN."  WE WERE WINNING. WE WERE WINNING IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  IN FACT, YOU MAY KNOW IT AS LOSING. ( LAUGHTER ). LIKE WIN, BUT IN REVERSE. ( LAUGHTER ) HANGING UPSIDE DOWN. BUT EVEN IN DEFEAT, SANTORUM WAS CLEAR ON JUST HOW IMPRESSED WE SHOULD ALL BE THAT A WELL-KNOWN  FORMER TWO-TERM SENATOR LOBBYIST AND TELEVISION ANALYST EVEN GOT THIS FAR.
MIRACLE AFTER MIRACLE, THIS RACE WAS AS IMPROBABLE AS ANY RACE THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE FOR PRESIDENT.
Jon:  REALLY! ANY RACE? EVER, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, WERE YOU ALIVE IN 2008? ( LAUGHTER ) WHEN A BLACK GUY NAMED BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA BEAT A 48-TERM WAR  HERO SENATOR AND HIS FLAG PIN OF A RUNNING MATE? WERE YOU ALIVE THEN? BECAUSE THAT WAS PRETTY ( BLEEP ) WEIRD. ( LAUGHTER ). SENATOR, YOU WEREN'T EVEN THE MOST IMPROBABLE THING IN THIS G.O.P. PRIMARY. THAT TITLE I BELIEVE STILL GOES TO A POKE MAN-SINGING PITA MAGNATE, WHOSE BIG IDEA IN THIS  RACE WAS A NUMBER.
9-9-9.
Jon:  9-9-9, BECAUSE TWO 9s WOULD BE STUPID. ( LAUGHTER ). AND FOUR WOULD BE CHAOS. YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL A MORE IMPROBABLE CANDIDATE STAYING IN THE RACE.
THE "SALT LAKE TRIBUNE" REPORTS NEWT GINGRICH'S $500  CHECK TO PAY THE FILING FEE FOR UTAH'S PRIMARY HAS BOUNCED. IF HE DOESN'T PAY UP BY APRIL 20, THE STORY SAYS, HIS NAME WILL NOT APPEAR ON THE BALLOT.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, IT'S EMBARRASSING THAT HE BOUNCED A CHECK. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S MORE EMBARRASSING? SPENDING YOUR LAST $500 TO GO UP AGAINST MORMON MITT ROMNEY IN UTAH. ( LAUGHTER ). IT SEEMS THE WRITING IS OAT WALL RIGHT NEXT TO A PHOTO OF NEWT GINGRICH WHICH SAYS, "DO NOT  ACCEPT CHECKS FROM THIS MAN."
GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR AFTER RICK SANTORUM DROPS OUT.
FASCINATING DAY. WELCOME TO THE FALL CAMPAIGN.
THE GLOVES ARE OFF. IT'S GAME ON.
TODAY, IT'S GAME ON.
IT'S GOING TO BE A HEAD-TO-HEAD FIGHT.
MANO A MANO, ROMNEY AND OBAMA, HERE WE GO.
Jon:  YEAH, MAN, MITT ROMNEY AND BARACK OBAMA ARE FREE NOW TO BEAT THE ( BLEEP ) OUT OF  EACH OTHER. IN FRONT OF US FOR MONTHS. THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO--
EXCUSE ME, JON. NOT SO FAST.
Jon:  WHO IS THAT? IS THAT SAMANTHA BEE?
JON HERE AT NEWT GINGRICH HEADQUARTERS, THE FEELING IS THAT THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  THAT'S THE GINGRICH HEADQUARTERS? IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN THE BACK OF A VAN.
GINGRICH TEMPORARY HEADQUARTERS UNTIL THE CAMPAIGN FINDS ITS FOOTING, YOU KNOW, GETS ITS MOMENTUM BACK. AND FOR THE RECORD, THIS IS NOT A VAN. IT IS A FORD EXPLORER. '95, I BELIEVE, POWER LOCKS, POWER STEERING. IT HAS AN AIM-F.M. STEREO --
YES, SAM, I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE STANDARD EQUIPMENT IN MOST AMERICAN-MADE CARS.
THE POINT IS GINGRICH IS NO QUITTER. HE IS IN IT TO WIN IT.
Jon:  SAM, THE IT'S OVER.  THE GUY IS BOUNCING $500 CHECKS. WHY STAY IN?
BECAUSE-- AND I AM GOING TO SAY THIS QUIETLY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WAKE HIM--  ( LAUGHTER ) THE MAN IS DELUSIONAL! THIS IS HIM FROM ONLY 10 HOURS AGO.
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, WHETHER IT'S GOVERNOR ROMNEY OR NEWT GINGRICH, IS GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE CONSERVATIVE  THAN IS BARACK OBAMA.
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE GINGRICH, ROMNEY? HE'S STILL GOT A 50-50 CHANCE, RIGHT? OH, OKAY, LET'S LOOK CATS IN KRISPY KREME IS COMING OUT OF HIS DONUT COMA. OH, GOD.
Jon:  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SAM, FOR THAT UPDATE. WHILE THE GINGRICH CAMPAIGN GOES ON, FOR MORE ON THE FIRST REAL DAY OF THE GENERAL ELECTION  WE'RE JOINED BY ASSIF MANDVI AT OBAMA HEADQUARTERS, AND WYATT CENAC WITH THE ROMNEY CAM  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GUYS, NOW THAT IT'S SORT OF SETTLED, GOT TO BE A LOT OF  EXCITEMENT OUT THERE WHERE YOU'RE AT.
YOU BET.
IT IS ON!
THE MAIN EVENT!
FINALLY, WE'VE GOT ALL THOSE CRAZY FRINGE CANDIDATES OUT OF THE WAY!
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, HOW DOES THE STRATEGY CHANGE, THEN, AS ROMNEY BEGINS TO FOCUS MORE ON  THE PRESIDENT?
JON, ROMNEY'S GOING STRAIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT'S KKILL EASE HEEL, OBAMACARE.
THIS PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN A FAILURE, AND AT THE CENTERPIECE OF THIS FAILURE IS THIS-- THIS  PIECE OF LEGISLATION BACK HERE, OBAMACARE.
Jon:  HOW CONVENIENT. HE HAD IT RIGHT BEHIND HIM. ASSIF, HOW DOES THE OBAMA CAMP COUNTER THAT.
HE'S GOING STRAIGHT FOR ROMNEY'S ACHILLES' HEEL.
ROMNEY IS THE GODFAWGTHS OF OUR HEALTH CARE PLAN.
YOU'VE GOT A GOVERNOR RUNNING FUR PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW WHO  INSTITUTED THE EXACT SAME THING IN MASSACHUSETTS.
SO-- ( LAUGHTER ) OBAMA IS SAYING MY HEALTH PLAN SUCKS? THAT'S RICH COMING FROM THE HIGH CHANCELLOR OF MASSA-CHU-SUCKS.
WELL, THAT IS NOT THE OBAMA TEAM'S WHOLE STRATEGY.
THE FOCUS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ON TURNING BACK THE CLOCK FOR WOMEN REALLY IS SOMETHING  THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND SHOWS HOW CALLOUS AND INSENSITIVE THEY  ARE TOWARDS WOMEN'S PRIORITIES.
A WAR, ON, LIKE, 20, 25% OF THE COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY. GUNS ARE NOT GOING TO GET YOU ELECTED.
Jon:  I THINK WOMEN ARE 50% OF THE COUNTRY.
REALLY? THEN WHY AM I STILL SINGLE!
Jon:  I DON'T KNOW. WYATT, HOWL WILL ROMNEY COMBAT THE WAR ON WOMEN ACCUSATIONS?
OH, I DON'T KNOW, PERHAPS WITH A WAR ON WOMEN ACCUSATION.
92.3% OF THE JOB LOSSES DURING THE OBAMA YEARS HAVE BEEN WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THOSE JOBS. THE REAL WAR ON WOMEN HAS BEEN THE JOB LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE OBAMA ECONOMY. Q. THAT'S IT?THIS IS WHAT THE CAMPAIGN-- THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BORROW  EACH OTHER'S ATTACKS? YOU ARE. I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY. IT'S LIKE TO ARMIES SHARING ONE CANNONBALL JUST BACK AND FORTH.
NO, NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHO WILL HANDLE THE WAR ON WOMEN, WOMEN CHARGED WITH SOME PIZAZZ.
RICK PERRY.
OH, YEAH, PERRY WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL, WAR ON WOMEN! WHERE DO I SIGN UP! IT'S MAN'S WORK.
OH, BUT WHAT ABOUT LIKE HERMAN CAIN HE WOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING COMPLETELY CRAZY LIKE  GRAB THE MIC, AND START SINGING "LADIES NIGHT."
Jon:  GUYS, IT'S OVER, THE WHOLE ENDLESS STREAM OF PRIMARY CANDIDATES IS DONE. AND REMEMBER, RIGHT BEFORE, THANK GOODNESS, RIGHT.
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH...
Jon:  YOU DON'T SEEM HAPPY.
DUDE, I'M NOT SURE I CAN TAKE 200 DAYS OF THIS. IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN BRING BACK THE CRAZY FRINGE CANDIDATES FOR JUST A LITTLE LONGER, PLEASE?
HELLO! ASLEEP BESIDE ME, THE MAYOR OF THE MOON? HE WANTS SCHOOL CHILDREN TO BE JANITORS. HE CALLS SPANISH THE LANGUAGE OF THE GHETTO.
YEAH!
GINGRICH!
HEY, HEY! YOU CAN'T TOW THIS CAR WITH ME IN IT IT!
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON IT
