(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK! BOOKS. BOOKS. YOU MAY KNOW THEM AS THE THING AMAZON TELLS YOU YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN WHEN YOU'RE BUYING D.V.D.s. (LAUGHTER) BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT BOOKS USED TO BE AVAILABLE IN WHAT WERE  CALLED POST OFFICE BOOKSTORES? WELL, THEY WERE.
BORDERS IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.
BORDERS COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH 21st CENTURY TECHNOLOGY AND TRENDS.
THE LATEST BREAK AND MORTAR VICTIM OF A DIGITAL AGE.
NOW WHERE AM I GOING TO RETURN ALL MY BOOKS FOR STORE CREDIT? FOR MORE WE TURN TO RESIDENT EXPERT JOHN HODGMAN. JOHN HODGMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LET ME ASK YOU, HOW CAN THE BELOVED BOOKSTORE, AN  INSTITUTION, COMPETE WITH THE DOWNLOADING AND MAIL ORDER OF THE BOOK?
WELL, JON, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. SUPREME GOTTEN USED TO THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING BOOKS DELIVERED RIGHT TO THEM. IF BOOKSTORES WANT TO COMPETE THEY HAVE TO GIVE THE CUSTOMERS A BETTER HOME EXPERIENCE SO THEY  CAN GET IN THEIR OWN HOMES.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING RECREATE...
EXACTLY, JON.
Jon: I DIDN'T FINISH WHAT I WAS SAYING.
I WASN'T LISTENING. I'M TALKING ABOUT GETTING RID OF THOSE OLD-FASHIONED BOOKSHELVES  AND REPLACE THEM WITH BEAUTIFUL WELL-APPOINTED DOWNLOADING PODS. BOOK LOVERS SIMPLY FEEL THEMSELVES INSIDE, STRIP DOWN TO THEIR UNDERWEAR, PICK UP A COLD  SLICE OF PIZZA AND START DOWNLOADING THE GREAT WORKS OF LITERATURE IN BETWEENS BOUTS OF  MASTURBATION AND YOUTUBE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S ALL THE FUN AND ISOLATION OF HOME WITH THE INCONVENIENCE  OF 20-MINUTE CAR RIDE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THERE'S STUFF BOOKSTORE CANS DO THAT THE INTERNET CAN'T.
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE SHELTER THE HOMELESS? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M TALKING ABOUT HAVING AUTHORS VISIT STORES.
OH, WELL, NOW WE'RE JUST SPLITTING HAIRS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: (LAUGHS)
THE REALITY IS, THERE'S NOTHING MORE DEPRESSING THAN SEEING SOME PASTY SHUT-IN AUTHOR  BARE HIS SOUL IN FRONT OF A HALF-FILLED ROW OF FOLDING CHAIRS. (LAUGHTER) BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. (LAUGHTER)
SO WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE TO THIS?
WELL, INSTEAD OF HOSTING READINGS, WHY NOT HOST EXCITING LIVE WRITINGS. BRING THE AUTHOR IN, TIE HIM TO A DESK AND MAKE HIM WRITE A NOVEL TO ORDER. (APPLAUSE) CUSTOMERS CAN SHOUT OUT THEIR OWN IDEAS WHILE PELTING THE WRITER WITH $4 SCONES. IT WILL BE FUN. GEORGE R.R. MARTIN NOT FINISHING THAT NEW "GAME OF THRONES" BOOK FAST ENOUGH FOR YOU? WELL, MAYBE HOT CHAI LATTE DOWN HIS NECK WILL SPEED HIM UP.
Jon: I'M NOT SURE A LOT AUTHORS WOULD AGREE TO THAT.
I THINK YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING AUTHORS' DESIRE FOR FREE CHAI AND THE OCCASIONAL  HUMAN TOUCH. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT. WHAT ABOUT THE HUMAN ELEMENT? BOOKSTORES GO TO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS YOU SIMPLY CANNOT GET FROM A COMPUTER. THERE ARE EMPLOYEE INTERACTIONS, EMPLOYEE RECOMMENDATIONS.
OH, YES, YES, THANK YOU. EMPLOYEE PICKS, THANK YOU PUDGY NECK BEARD COUNTER GUY FOR CLUING ME INTO PHILIP K. DICK-- AGAIN. WHAT'S THE MATTER? ARE YOU SOLD OUT OF "CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES" THIS WEEK? HA HA! UP HIGH, JON, LITERATURE SLAM! I GOT 'EM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I THINK I HURT MY READING ELBOW.
Jon: YOU SHOULD GET THAT LOOKED AT.
YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT, JOHN. BOOKSTORES EMPLOY A SPECIAL CLASS OF CONDESCENDING NERD. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT USED TO WORK AT VIDEO STORES BEFORE THEY WENT UNDER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHERE WERE THEY BEFORE THAT?
RECORD STORES, OBVIOUSLY. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE YEARS FOR CONDESCENDING NERDS. (LAUGHTER) AND AS BOOKSTORES FALL, JON, AMERICAN WILL BE INUNDATED WITH A WANDERING SNARKY UNDERCLASS OF UNEMPLOYABLE PURVEYORS OF  USELESS AND ARCANE ESOTERICA.
Jon: I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND.
NO, WELL, YOU WOULDN'T. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU SEEM TO HATE BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEES.
OH, I LOATHE THEM, JON. THEY SHOVE MY BOOKS UNDER HUMOR, NOT WITTICISM AS I ASKED! DO I LOOK LIKE "MARPL DUKE" TO YOU? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MARMADUKE IS A VERY BIG DOG." (LAUGHS)
PATHETIC. WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS, JON, THE BIG BOX BOOKSTORE HAS PASSED INTO HISTORY. NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD EMBRACE AND BE PROUD OF BY PRESERVING BORDERS AS A POPULAR HISTORICAL ATTRACTION.
Jon: LIKE COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG.
EXACTLY. BRING THE KIDS DOWN TO YE OLDE BORDERSTOWN. LET THEM SEE WHAT IT FELT LIKE TO PAW THROUGH A CLEARANCE BIN OF CALENDAR OR SNEAK A PEEK AT  PORNOGRAPHY PRINTED ON ACTUAL PAPER ON THE GIANT RACK OF WEIRD  MAGAZINES YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF. INCLUDING MY PERSONAL FAVORITE "BOOKSTORE MAGAZINE RACK AFICIONADO MAGAZINE."
Jon: I THINK A BOOKSTORE PRESERVE MIGHT APPEAL TO A SMALL MARKET.
CAN'T BE SMALLER THAN THE MARKET OF PEOPLE WHO BRI BOOKS ANYWAY. SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE? GATHER ROUND, YOUNG' UNS AND SEE HOW WE USED TO HAVE BOOK LIGHTS. IN THE 1980s AN ICE CREAM WAS A SIGN OF WEALTH AND BOOKS DIDN'T GLOW.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY
