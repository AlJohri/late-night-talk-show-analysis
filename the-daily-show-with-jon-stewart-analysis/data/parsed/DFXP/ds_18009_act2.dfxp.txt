(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LAST WEEK'S  VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL  ABOUT THAT DEBATE. HAD TO DO WITH THE MODERATOR  MARTHA RADDATZ
WASN'T THIS A MASSIVE  INTELLIGENCE FAILURE, VICE  PRESIDENT BIDEN? YOU HAVE REFUSED AGAIN TO OFFER  SPECIFICS ON HOW YOU PAY FOR  THAT 20% ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAX  CUT
NOT A SINGLE THING HE SAID IS  ACCURATE. FIRST OF ALL...
BE SPECIFIC. THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? MILITARY FOLLOWS ORDERS. I MEAN, TRUST ME, THERE ARE  PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT  PULLING OUT. DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE  SPECIFICS OR ARE YOU STILL  WORKING ON IT AND THAT'S WHY YOU  WON'T TELL VOTERS?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS  BUT IT WAS THE LANGUAGE OF  JOURNALISM BEING SPOKEN ON  MODERN TELEVISION. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. MARTHA RADDATZ! WATCHING HER MODERATE THAT  DEBATE WITH... OH, MY GOD,  EDITORIAL... LIKE GOING TO AMISH  COUNTRY AND SEEING THEM MAKING BEAUTIFUL CHAIRS BY HAND. YOU'RE LIKE I THOUGHT THIS CRAFT  HAD BEEN COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. WHY CAN'T EVERY CHAIR BE MADE  LIKE THIS? ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PREVIOUS  DEBATE WHEN JIM LEHRER  APPARENTLY FELT HIS JOB WAS TO  SIMPLY ESTABLISH THAT THE STAGE HAD MORE THAN ONE PERSON ON IT
DO YOU SEE A MAJOR DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU ON SOCIAL  SECURITY? DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S A  FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  THE TWO OF YOU AS TO HOW YOU  VIEW THE MISSION OF THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT? WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN  THE TWO OF YOU?
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS. DO YOU EVEN SEE TWO PEOPLE? BECAUSE I SEE TWO PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE, BUT  OBVIOUSLY THERE LOOKS LIKE, I  DON'T KNOW, TWO. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. HOW GOOD A JOB DID MARTHA  RADDATZ DO? BOTH PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS HAVE  ALREADY LAUNCHED PRE-EMPTIVE  STRIKES ON THE NEXT DEBATE  MODERATOR
THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE ASKED THE  COMMISSION TO CHECK WITH CANDY  CROWLEY TO SAY DO YOU GET THE  FACTS? WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE A VERY  LIMITED ROLE, VERY FEW  FOLLOW-UPS, TRAFFIC COPS
Jon: OR TRAFFIC CONE OR THE  PAINT ON THE ROAD. I GUESS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS YOU  DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE, CANDY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST DON'T POINT [BLEEP] IT OUT  TO EITHER ONE OF US. I WASN'T THE ONLY HEARING DREAM  WEAVER WHENEVER MARTHA RADDATZ  SPOKE
MARTHA RADDATZ DID SUPERBLY  AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT JOB  TODAY KEEPING BOTH OF THESE  CANDIDATES IN PLACE, ASKING FIRST-RATE QUESTIONS
SHE WAS COMMANDING. SHE FOLLOWED UP WHEN SHE NEEDED  TO.
Jon: I MEAN, WE ALL REALLY  CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT SHE DID. I MEAN REALLY MADE US LOOK LIKE [BLEEP]. REALLY [BLEEP]. WITH THAT WHOLE JOURNALISM  THING. ANY-WHO, WE NOW TURN BACK TO OUR  REGULARLY SCHEDULED SHOW, ROGUE  PARTISANS KILLING TIME WITH  TWEETS AND OTHER GIMMICKY  CRAFTS.
JOE BIDEN WAS HAVING AN  ABSOLUTE MELTDOWN IN TERMS OF  HIS FACE MOVEMENTS
RYAN WAS COMING ACROSS AS  ROBOTIC
I'M SEEING SPIKES NOW ON  THING LIKE RUDE
TWITTER WAS AFIRE AFTER THE  DEBATE LAST NIGHT.
WE SAW THE CONGRESSMAN  DRINKING A LOT OF WATER. BIDEN ON THE OTHER HAND WAS NOT  SO THIRSTY.
WHAT IS THIS ON PAUL RYAN'S  FACE?
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ARE 491  DIFFERENT POINTS ON HIS FACE  THAT ARE MEASURING DIFFERENT  MUSCLE MOVEMENT.
Jon: JUST QUIT. CNN DIDN'T JUST TALK TO A GUY  WITH A 3-D MODEL OF PAUL RYAN'S  FACE. THEY TALKED FOR FIVE MINUTES  WITH A GUY WITH A 3-D MODEL OF  PAUL RYAN'S FACE. THE FIRST STEP IN UNDERSTANDING  SOMEONE'S FACE IS OBSCURING IT  ENTIRELY WITH COMPUTER GRAPHICS. REALLY SUMS UP CNN'S APPROACH TO  ALMOST EVERY STORY. SURE, PAUL RYAN LOOKS ANNOYED. BUT HOW CAN YOU TELL? YOU'RE PROBABLY ONLY PROCESSING  410 OF HIS FACIAL DATA POINTS. NOW I GET WHAT HE'S FEELING. BUT OF COURSE AS WE LEARNED FROM  THE PUNDITS, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO  GO ON? OTHER THAN THE FACE?
IF YOU READ THE TRANSCRIPT,  YOU MIGHT WELL CONCLUDE THAT THE  VICE PRESIDENT HAD A VERY STRONG  DEBATE.
IF YOU HEARD IT ON RADIO,  BIDEN WON. IF YOU WATCHED IT ON TELEVISION,  HE LOST.
IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHO WINS A  DEBATE AND WHO DOESN'T, TURN OFF  THE SOUND AND AND WATCH THEM
Jon: REALLY? TURN OFF THE SOUND. DO YOU MEAN A DEBATE OR THE  PRICE IS RIGHT SHOW CASE  SHOWDOWN? ACTUALLY, HOWARD DEAN IS RIGHT. SOME THINGS ARE BETTER WHEN YOU  WATCH THEM WITH THE SOUND OFF. WE'LL BE RIGHT
