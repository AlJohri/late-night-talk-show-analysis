JUNE 14th, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A REAL GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. ACTRESS CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IS GOING TO BE JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT ON THE PROGRAM. I'M EXCITED TONIGHT. I'M EXCITED TONIGHT. I JUST RECEIVED TERRIFIC NEWS. I'M APPARENTLY THE NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF VAGINISTAN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S JUST RECEIVED THE VOTES TONIGHT FROM--  (LAUGHTER) I GUESS THE EMMISSARY. ANYWAY, AS YOU REMEMBER, I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK A LITTLE BIT. SOMEWHERE AROUND FOUR YEARS AGO OUR ECONOMY EXPERIENCED A CYCLICAL FISCAL PHENOMENON  KNOWN AS A CATASTROPHE  [BLEEP] WHEN OUR LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BEGAN TO COLLAPSE AFTER MAKING  INCREDIBLY RISKY BETS BASICALLY USING OUR PENSION MONEY TO GAMBLE ON THE VALUE OF OUR HOUSES. BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE BUSINESS IS JUST TAKING YOUR MONEY AND THEN LOANING IT  OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE AT SLIGHTLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES IS JUST TOO --
BANK AFTER BANK SWALLOWED IN THE AFTERMATH, LEHMAN AND BEAR STERN, DONE, MERRILL, DEAD, SOLD FOR PARTS, WHAT MU AND GOLDMAN, YOU GET THE IDEA. NOBODY DID WELL. JPMORGAN CHASE--  (LAUGHTER)
AND THEIR FEARLESS LEADER JAMENY DIAMON.
JAME ME DIE UPON SEEMS TO BE THE ONE GUY YOU TRUST AND BELIEVE IN.
JAY ME DIAMON THE NEAR COLLAPSE OF THE BANKING INDUSTRY GOOD FOR THE  JPMORGAN CHIEF BURNISHING HIS REPUTATION AS A SUPERHERO C.E.O..
WE DIDN'T MAKE HUGE BETS.
Jon: IN THE FINANCIAL WORLD, YOU DON'T NORMALLY HEAR PRAISE LIKE THAT UNLESS  IT'S DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT-- YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER) PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT SO SOMEONE THIS HANDSOME TO BE THIS SMART AND RICH. (LAUGHTER) WELL, ANYWAY, GUESS WHAT HAPPENED LAST MONTH.
LAWMAKERS ARE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT JPMORGAN'S STAGGERING LOSSES AND THE  SHUDDER IT SENT THROUGH WALL STREET. THE LARGEST BANK FIRST ESTIMATED IT LOST ABOUT $2 BILLION ON RISKY INVESTMENTS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: $2 BILLION ON RISKY INVESTMENTS. WE DON'T MAKES TO BETS THAX IS AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF MONEY. THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY THAT MAKES THAT LOOK GOOD.
EXEXPERTS NOW SAY THE LOSSES COULD BE CLOSER TO $7 BILLION.
Jon: OKAY, THE $2 BILLION ISING LAING PRETTY GOOD NOW. APOLOGIZE. I WAS INCORRECT ABOUT THE 2. WHAT GIVES, JAY ME DIAMON, YOU WERE THE BANKER.
YOU WERE THE ONE. WHO DIDN'T MAKE THESE BIG, RISKY BETS.
THE PORTFOLIO HAS PROVEN TO BE RISKIER, MORE VOLATILE AND LESS EFFECTIVE THAN  ECONOMIC HEDGE THAN WE THOUGHT.
Jon: THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE [BLEEP] I HAVE EVER HEARD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DIDN'T MAKE A BET, IT'S A HEDGE. I DIDN'T GET WIPED OUT AND LOSE ALL MY MONEY, IT'S JUST THAT HARD WAY IS PROVEN A  MORE RISKY VOLATILE-- VOLATILE ECONOMIC HEDGE THAN I THOUGHT. WELL, NO SURPRISE THAT DIAMON WAS CALLED DOWN TO CAPITOL HILL TO FACE THE MIGHTY SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY RENOWNED, LIKELY SO, I THINK, AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE BEST C.E.O.s IN THE COUNTRY.
YOU'VE GOT VERY BIG PROFITS. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FIREPOWER. YOU'RE JUST HUGE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DON'T MEAN TO EMBARRASS YOU BUT IT'S STAGGERING. (LAUGHTER) IS THERE A MRS. DIAMON OR--  (LAUGHTER) BUT THEY DIDN'T JUST HAUL  JAMIE DIAMON IN TO TELL HIM HOW NICE AND GOOD HE IS AND HUGE HE IS, THEY ALSO  BROUGHT HIM IN THERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THEY, THE SENATE, ARE.
WE CAN HARDLY SIT IN JUDGEMENT OF YOUR LOSING $2 BILLION. WE LAWS TWICE THAT EVERY DAY HERE IN WASHINGTON.
Jon: DOES SENATOR DEMINT THINK THAT SPENDING MONEY IS THE SAME AS LOSING MONEY? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW, HI $10 MILLION HERE YESTERDAY BUT NOW ALL I SEE IS THIS  [BLEEP] HIGHWAY. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T UNDERSTAND. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE IT'S GOING. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHERE'S MY MONEY. WE'RE GOING HAVE TO DIG THIS UP AND FIND MY MONEY. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS PANEL OF SENATORS? SUCKING UP TO JAME ME DIAMON LIKE THEY WERE ON THE PAYROLL.
THE BIGGEST CAMPAIGN DONOR TO MANY OF THE BANKING COMMITTEE IS JPMORGAN CHASE.
Jon: WELL, LOOK, WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT DOES MONEY LIKE THAT GET YOU.
WHAT SHOULD THE FUNCTION OF THE REGULATORS BE.
WHAT OTHER AREAS OF OVERSIGHT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR US.
I WOULD LIKE TO COME AWAY FROM THE HEARING TODAY WITH SOME IDEAS ON WHAT YOU THINK  WE NEED TO DO.
WE'RE HERE QUIZZING YOU. IF YOU WERE SITTING ON THIS SIDE OF THE DIAS, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM  SAFER THAN IT IS.
Jon: WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT JAYME-- JAMIE DIAMON IN A CHAIR LIKE CELO'S FROM THE  VOICE AND IF HE HEARS SOMETHING HE LIKES, BOOM, YOU JUST EARNED YOURSELF ANOTHER TERM IN CONGRESS.
THE TRUTH IS THE PERSON HARDEST ON JAMIE DIAMON WAS JAMIE-- JAMIE DIE UPON.
WE LOST SOME OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS MONEY, FOR THAT WE FEEL TERRIBLE.
WHEN I MADE THAT STATEMENT I WAS DEAD WRONG.
WE LET A LOT OF PEOPLE DOWN AND WE ARE VERY SORRY FOR DID.
UNDER ANY NAME, WHATEVER YOU CALL IT I WILL NOT DEFEND IT, IT VIOLATED COMMON SENSE.
I'M NOT ASKING, I'M TELLING WITH THIS, KICK MY ASS. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SEE, AS BAD AS THE BANKS AND THE BANKERS MAY HAVE BEEN, THE ONE THING  THAT THE SENATORS WANTED TO REMIND EVERYONE IS, GOVERNMENT IS WORSE.
IF DODD FRANK MORE THAN MARGINALLY MADE OUR BANKING SYSTEM SAFER.
I-- YOU KNOW, WE SUPPORTED SOME ELEMENT --
I KNOW WHAT YOU SUPPORTED. HAS IT MADE OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM SAFER. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE REGULATORY REGIME THAT CONGRESS PUT IN PLACE, HAS  IT MADE OUR SYSTEM SAFER?
I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY. ONE OF YOUR PEERS, NOT QUITE AS WELL-KNOWN AS YOU BUT VERY-- BELIEVES NOT.
Jon: SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME, LOOK AT ME AS I ASK YOU, DID THE  SDOD FRANK LEGISLATION MAKE US SAFER? ARE YOU OPPOSED TO THE DODD FRANK LEGISLATION.
ACTUALLY, BOB CORKER DOES RAISE A PRETTY GOOD POINT. THE DODD FRANK LEGISLATION HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO MAKE OUR BANKING SYSTEM SAFER. OF COURSE T MIGHT HAVE DONE BET FERR IT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE STRINGENT BUT APPARENTLY  ONE SENATOR BOB CORKER VOTED AGAINST PROVISIONS LIKE BANNING NAKED CREDIT DEFAULT  SWAPS KEEPING BANKS FROM GETTING TOO BIG TO FAIL AND OPPOSED REINSTATING THE  GLASS STEGALL RULES FROM KEPT BANKS FROM GAMBLING WITH THE MONEY DEPOSITORS  HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEN THERE IS THERE IS THIS.
SENATOR CORKER SAYS HE PLANS O TO POSE THE PLAN.
Jon: IT MUST BE NICE TO BE A REPUBLICAN SENATOR BECAUSE YOU GET THE FUN  OFBREAK BRACK SHALL BREAKING  [BLEEP] AND THE JOY OF COMPLAINING THAT THE [BLEEP] YOU JUST BROKE DOESN'T WORK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
