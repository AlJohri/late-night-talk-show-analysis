[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. TIME NOW TO CHECK IN WITH  EVERYONE'S FAVORITE FREQUENT  NON-FLYER, EDWARD SNOWDEN WHO WAS LAST SEEN AT THE MOSCOW  AIRPORT SUBSISTING ENTIRELY ON  DUTY FREE FOOD. BUT SNOWDEN'S AIRPORT VACATION  MIGHT BE COMING TO AN END.
SNOWDEN'S LAWYERS SAY HE  COULD LEAVE THE AIRPORT IN THE  NEXT FEW DAYS AFTER SOME PAPERWORK HAS BEEN CLEARED UP. JUST A FUN FACT. THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE AN  EXTRADITION AGREEMENT WITH  RUSSIA.
John: FUN FACT? THAT'S NOT A FUN FACT. THAT IS PERTINENT INFORMATION. A FUN FACT WOULD BE MORE LIKE  COWS CAN'T WALK DOWNSTAIRS OR... THAT'S A FUN FACT. IF IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE CARE  ABOUT IT, YOU CAN JUST CALL IT  NEWS. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE EMBARRASSED  ABOUT REPORTING IT. ANYWAY, PAPERWORK FOR THE  RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, I MEAN I'M  GOING TO GUESS THAT THAT IS A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. PAGES AND PAGES OF OFFICIAL  DOCUMENTS NOTARIZED AND FILLED  OUT IN TRIPLICATE.
SNOWDEN HAS IN FACT APPLIED  FOR TEMPORARY ASYLUM IN RUSSIA. HE DID SO ON A VERY BRIEF  REQUEST, INFORMAL TO SAY THE  LEAST, HANDWRITTEN BECAUSE HIS LAWYER SAID THIS WOULD LOOK MORE  CONVINCING.
John: MORE CONVINCING? IS HIS LAURA TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL? ... IS HIS LAWYER A TEN-YEAR-OLD  GIRL? CAN I HAVE ASYLUM PLEASE? CHECK YES. IT SEEMS THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN  MIGHT BE ON HIS WAY SOMEWHERE  SOON. THE QUESTION IS, WHERE?
SNOWDEN HAS BEEN OFFERED  REFUGE IN VENEZUELA, NICARAGUA  AND BOLIVIA.
John: BY COINCIDENCE THOSE  ARE THE EXACT THREE COUNTRIES I  WOULD NAME IF ASKED WHAT COUNTRY WOULD YOU NOT LEAVE A RUSSIAN  AIRPORT BATHROOM FOR? LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF  OURSELVES. FIRST HE HAS TO GET OUT OF  RUSSIA. WHAT DOES PRESIDENT PUTIN PLAN  TO DO WITH SNOWDEN?
John: HOW SHOULD I KNOW? BRING ME HIS BALLS ON A PLATTER  SO THAT I MAY PLAY WITH THEM. OH, SNOW DEP, WHY DID YOU SEEK  ASYLUM IN A COUNTRY RUN BY AN  ACTUAL VILLAIN? BECAUSE BETWEEN THE EVIL LAUGH  AND THE UNDERWATER ESCAPE POD,  ALL HE'S MISSING IS A... AND THAT IS AN ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPH. YOU ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE,  SNOWDEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT
