[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT'S OUR PROGRAM. BEFORE WE GO, WE HAVE GREAT NEWS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FANS OF THIS SHOW BUT DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE LOOKING AT ME. WE'VE LAUNCHED OUR VERY OWN PODCAST ENTITLED... [LAUGHTER] THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO... THERE WE GO. "THE DAILY SHOW" PODCAST WITHOUT JON STEWART. IT'S FULL OF GREAT INTERVIEWS WITH DAILY SHOW WRITERS, PRODUCERS, CORRESPONDENTS ABOUT HOW THIS WHOLE PROGRAM COMES TOGETHER. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT ALL AWAY. IT'S BURBON AND XANEX. ANYWAY, DOWNLOAD IT THERE ON THE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, iTUNES OR OUR WEBSITE. AS ALWAYS, PLEASE ENJOY THE PODCAST RESPONSIBLY. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
OUR UNDERWEAR IS ACTUALLY FUNCTIONAL. IT'S FANTASTIC FOR MOMS AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT'S ACTUALLY GREAT FOR THAT TIME OF THE MONTH.
WOW.
I BET YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.
THAT WAS A LOT TO TAKE FOR US.
YOU KNOW, MODERN MEN HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THESE SUBJECTS. WE TALKED ABOUT OVULATION THE OTHER DAY.
