Jon:  WELCOME BACK. IN THE CURRENT VERSION, [CROWD CHEERING] IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF OUR WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT WE KNOW. ONE, ISIS REPRESENTS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR NATION. TWO, THIS MASSIVE THREAT REQUIRES NO SACRIFICES ON ANYBODY'S PART BECAUSE THREE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM WITH AIR STRIKES AND TRUSTED ALLIES. TURNS OUT, THERE'S ONE LITTLE SNAG.
THE IRAQI ARMY HAS COLLAPSED. THAT THERE IS NO REAL  IRAQI ARMY.
Jon: THAT'S WEIRD. JUST WHOO! BECAUSE I DO REMEMBER THE UNITED STATES SPENDING EIGHT YEARS AND $25 BILLION TRAINING SOMEBODY'S ARMY OVER THERE. DOES IRAQ HAVE A TWIN BROTHER, PERHAPS? ALRIGHT, BUT FINE, THE IRAQI ARMY WON'T BE THERE TO REAP THE STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE OF OUR HIGH TECH BOOM-BOOM JUICE. WHO NEEDS AN ARMY WHEN YOU HAVE AN ARMY OF COALITION FRIENDS.
CRACKS IN THE COALITION. [LAUGHTER]
CRACKS IN THE WHAT NOW?
CRASHED IN THE COALITION. THE PRESIDENT TALKS TODAY TO KEY ALLIES AFTER MEETING WITH NEARLY TWO DOZEN MILITARY LEADERS FROM THE COUNTRIES HE'S COUNTING ON TO HELP FIGHT ISIS. BUT ARE THEY ALL WILLING TO PULL THEIR WEIGHT?
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THERE. TO GIVE A FEW ATTA BOYS, SLAPS ON THE BACK. THANKS FOR JOINING THE COALITION. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
Jon: THE ALLIES DON'T WANT TO FULLY COMMIT TO DEFEATING ISIS UNLESS THEY GET A MEET AND GREET WITH THE PRESIDENT. WHAT ARE THEY 14 YEAR OLDS AT A JUSTIN BIEBER CONCERT? ALRIGHT MAYBE THE COALITION ISN'T AS STRONG AS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. ANYBODY, ANYBODY GOING TO STEP UP?
WE'RE LEARNING THAT TURKEY IS NOW GOING TO LET THE U.S. USE ITS AIR BASES AS A BASE FOR THE LAUNCHING OF THOSE AIR STRIKES BOTH IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.
Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. TURKEY, I ALWAYS KNEW, IT'S THE ONE COUNTRY YOU CAN COUNT ON. TURKEY. GOOD OLD OTTO, MAN. ATTA TURK. I KNEW YOU GUYS WOULD COME THROUGH WITH THE, WHAT'S THAT? REALLY, ONE DAY LATER.
TURKEY IS DENYING REPORTS THAT THE U.S. CAN USE ITS BASES FOR AIR STRIKES.
Jon:  CAN'T USE THE BASES. WHAT THE HELL TURKEY? YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL ABOUT THE BASE, ABOUT THE BASE. WE'RE ALL ABOUT THE BASE. NO REBELS, WE'RE ALL ABOUT THE BASE. [LAUGHTER] WHY WOULDN'T -- I REALLY, I REALLY LACK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RHYTHM, DON'T I? IT'S WAS HARD FOR ME EVEN TO PERFORM LET ALONE HOW HARD IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR YOU TO WATCH. [LAUGHTER] I HOPE YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALREADY ASLEEP. WHY WOULDN'T TURKEY, OUR NATO ALLY LET US USE ITS AIR BASES UNLESS IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE USING THE BASES THEMSELVES.
WELL TURKISH WAR PLANES WENT ON THE ATTACK MONDAY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. I GET IT. THEY WANT THE CREDIT, IT'S ALL STARTING TO MAKE SENSE NOW.
BUT INSTEAD OF POUNDING ISIL POSITIONS IN SYRIA, THE TURKS ATTACKED KURDISH FIGHTERS IN TURKEY FROM THE PKK. A GROUP WITH STRONG TIES TO THE KURDS FIGHTING ISIL IN KOBANI.
WHAT THE [BLEEP]? SO WHILE OVER IN KOBANI, WE'VE BEEN BOMBING ISIS TO HELP THE KURDS, OUR GOOD FRIEND TURKEY HAS AT THE SAME TIME A FEW MILES AWAY BEEN BOMBING KURDS THEREBY HELPING ISIS. THAT WAS NEVER IN RISK. WHAT, WHY.
BECAUSE THE PKK WERE SHELLING MILITARY OUTPOSTS IN THAT AREA, THE KURDS EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT TURKEY NOT ALLOWING KURDS INTO KOBANI TO HELP THE GROUP THERE FIGHT ISIL BACK.
THERE WAS A VERY BRUTAL, YOU KNOW, 30-YEAR INSURGENCY WHERE KURDS WERE TRYING TO FIGHT AND FIND THE TURKISH ARMY TO CREATE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT STATE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I'M  STARTING TO THINK THAT THE BRITISH JUST GOING IN THERE AND DRAWING A BUNCH OF LINES AND SAYING [BLEEP] IT GOOD LUCK EVERYBODY WASN'T SUCH A GREAT IDEA. ISN'T THERE ANYONE OUT THERE WHO JUST WANTS TO GO IN AND FIGHT SOME ISIS.
MEMBERS OF A MOTORCYCLE GANG FROM THE NETHERLANDS HAVE TRAVELED TO IRAQ TO HELP KURDS THERE FIGHT ISIS. THE BIKERS WENT TO IRAQ TO QUOTE EXTERMINATE THE RODENTS OF ISIS.
WE ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME BOOTS ON THE GROUND. I GUESS WE CAN'T BE PICKY ABOUT WHAT KIND OF BOOTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
