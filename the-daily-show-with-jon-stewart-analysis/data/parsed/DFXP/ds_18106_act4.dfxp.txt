Jon: WELCOME BACK, LOOK,  OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY HAS SEEN  THE IMAGES OF DEVASTATION IN OKLAHOMA AND AS MUCH AS THEY  ALREADY APPEAR LIKE THEY'RE  GETTING OFF THE MATT AND STARTING TO REBUILD,  INCREDIBLE RESILIENCE AND  TENACITY. FOR ANYBODY WISHING TO SEND  DONATION AND HELP THERE ARE  GREAT ORGANIZATION TEXT RED CROSS TO 90999, $10  DONATION. AND OTHER GREAT  ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE  OKLAHOMA.GOV WEB SITE,  ANYBODY IN THAT SITUATION, THEY SURE COULD USE SOME  EXTRA HELP. THAT'S OUR SHOW, JOIN US  TOMORROW, HERE IT IS, YOUR  MOMENT OF ZEN.
