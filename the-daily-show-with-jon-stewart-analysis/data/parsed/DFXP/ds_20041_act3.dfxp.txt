Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, A WRITER JOURNALISM PROFESSOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED, "AMERICA'S BITTER PILL: MONEY, POLITICS, BACKROOM DEALS AND THE FIGHT TO FIX OUR BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM," PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, STEVEN BRILL. SIR! NICE TO SEE YOU. WELCOME. (APPLAUSE) ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
GLAD TO BE HERE.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED "AMERICA'S BITTER PILL." SO LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE YOU HAD WRITTEN THIS SORT OF INCREDIBLE ARTICLE FOR "TIME" MAGAZINE, WHICH WAS AN OLD -- BACK IN THE OLD DAYS WAS MAGAZINE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IN THE NEWSSTANDS.
RIGHT. WEEKLY. WEEKLY --
Jon: EXACTLY. BUT IT DETAILED AN AWFUL LOT OF THE INHERENT COST FLUCTIATIONS IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WERE NOT BEING ADDRESSED. IS THIS THE -- THE FLESHED OUT VERSION OF THAT?
WELL, I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
Jon: YES, SIR.
IT USES THE SAGA OF THE FIGHT OVER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OBAMACARE, TO TELL THE STORY OF DYSFUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT TRYING TO FIX A DYSFUNCTIONAL HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS.
Jon: BLIND LEADING THE BLIND.
YEAH.
Jon: WHAT IS SO INTERESTING TO ME. SO YOU COME ON, YOU WRITE THIS REALLY REVEALING EXPOSE ABOUT THE MEDICAL SYSTEM, COME ON THE PROGRAM. HOW MUCH LATER, A LITTLE BIT LATER, YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE HOSPITAL.
RIGHT. AS I WAS FINISHING THE REPORTING FOR THE BOOK, LITERALLY ON THE LAST DAY OF ENROLLMENT ON THE EXCHANGES FOR OBAMACARE WHICH WAS WHAT A LOT OF MY REPORTING WAS ABOUT, I WAS TOLD BY A DOCTOR DURING ROUTINE CHECKUP THAT I NEEDED AN EMERGENCY OPEN HEART SURGERY. SO OBVIOUSLY I FIGURED THIS GUY WAS TRYING TO EXPLOIT THE CHARGE AND EVERYTHING I WAS DOING. THIS WAS JUST HIS REVENGE. BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. I HAD THIS THING CALLED AN ANEURYSM, YOU HAVE NO SYMPTOMS. I FELT FINE. I WORKED OUT THE DAY I HAD THE CHECKUP.
Jon: IN YOUR HEART. AN ANEURYSM IN YOUR HEART.
YEAH, IT'S LIKE A BUBBLE RIGHT ON YOUR HEART, ON YOUR CHEST. AND IF IT BURSTS, YOU DON'T GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, YOU'RE JUST DEAD.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS TRYING TO KILL YOU?
I THOUGHT -- I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THAT. AND I THINK HE WAS JUST UPSET WITH, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE BOOK, BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO WRITE ABOUT -- HOW THE WEB SITE DIDN'T LAUNCH AND WHY IT DIDN'T LAUNCH. HOW HE WAS TOLD IT WASN'T GOING TO LAUNCH WELL BUT HE WENT AHEAD ANYWAY. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY MOST OF IT.
Jon: SO THE NSA AT NIGHT MINIATURIZED, CRAWLED THROUGH YOUR NASAL SYSTEM, BLEW A BUBBLE IN YOUR HEART.
I HOPE IT WAS MY NASAL SYSTEM.
Jon: EXACTLY THERE ARE TOO MANY WAYS TO GET IN THERE.
THAT'S RIGHT. SO HAS -- SETTLE DOWN. (LAUGHTER)
YOU GOT THAT.
Jon: FANTASTIC VOYAGE. FANTASTIC VOYAGE. HAS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DONE -- SO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE IN THERE IS WE AS A NATION COULD NOT COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN FOR DRUG PRICES.
RIGHT. RIGHT.
SO OUR DRUG PRICES WERE UNREASONABLY HIGH AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. OUR STANDING ON HEALTH CARE WAS ENORMOUS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND YET THE HEALTH RESULTS WERE NOT THE SAME.
RIGHT.
Jon: HAVE WE ADDRESSED ANY OF THESE?
WELL, THE WHOLE REFORM WAS SUPPOSED TO DO TWO THINGS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GET MORE PEOPLE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE ONE OF THE SCANDALS IS THAT WE ARE THE ONLY DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CAN'T GET HEALTH CARE.
Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. IT SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THAT.
AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CUT COST.
Jon: YES.
THE GOOD NEWS IS IT GOT MORE PEOPLE HEALTH CARE.
Jon: YES.
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT HEALTH CARE BY PAYING THE SAME EXORBITANT PRICES AND ALLOWING THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE SO-CALLED NONPROFIT HOSPITALS --
Jon: RIGHT.
AND MEDICAL-DEVICE MAKERS TO MAKE THE SAME EXORBITANT PROFITS THAT ARE UNSEEN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. SO WE'RE ALL ON THE LINE FOR THAT.
Jon: IT HAS NOT CONTROLLED THE PRICES. BUT YET --
IT JUST CREATED A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW CUSTOMERS FOR THIS RIDICULOUS NONFUNCTIONAL MARKETPLACE.
Jon: RIGHT. BUT DOESN'T THE FACT THAT IT CREATES ALL THESE NEW CUSTOMERS DRIVE DOWN THE PRICES OF THE HEALTH PLANS.
NO, WHY WOULD IT? THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DRIVEN DOWN. THEY HAVE NO MARKET CONTROLS. IT IS NOT A FREE MARKET.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO ONE IN THIS AUDIENCE, YOU OR I, WHO CAN BE ANY KIND OF A SAVVY CUSTOMER WHEN WE'RE GETTING HEALTH CARE.
Jon: BUT YET HASN'T HEALTH CARE SPENDING GONE DOWN IN 2014? DIDN'T -- IN THE --
NO. THE RATE OF INCREASE HAS SLOWED --
Jon: SLOWED --
SLIGHTLY.
Jon: THAT'S SOMETHING.
THAT'S SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IF YOU READ --
Jon: THE RATE OF INCREASE.
THE 965 PAGES OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT --
Jon: I'M ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY THROUGH.
I'M THE ONLY NERD -- YEAH, WELL, I'M ACTUALLY AHEAD OF YOU. I'M A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF YOU. THERE IS ISN'T ANYTHING IN THAT BILL THAT DOES ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE HIGH COST OF DRUGS, THE PROFITS MADE BY NONPROFIT HOSPITALS.
Jon: RIGHT. WELL, THOSE WERE THE DEALS THEY MADE TO GET IT PASSED.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
Jon: BUT HAVEN'T THEY, WHAT I'VE READ IS THAT THE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES FOR THESE POLICIES--
RIGHT.
Jon: THE FACT THAT PEOPLE NOW WILL HAVE TO GO MORE OUT OF POCKET FOR THE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES HAS CAUSED PEOPLE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT THE TYPES OF CARE THAT WERE MORE ROUTINE, THAT THEY HAVE SLOWED THEIR SPENDING IN THAT REGARD.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. THAT IS A NICE THOUGHT. AND, YOU KNOW, THE SECOND PART OF THAT NICE THOUGHT IS IT MAY CAUSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE MEANS, NOT TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. BUT THE, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WITH HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES IS VERY SIMPLE.
Jon: YES.
THE PRICES ARE TOO DAMN HIGH. IT'S LIKE THAT GUY WHO RAN FOR MAYOR OR SOMETHING WHO SAID THE RENT IS TOO HIGH.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
THE PRICES ARE ALL TOO HIGH. AND-- .
Jon: YOU JUST WROTE THAT GUY'S NEXT MAYORAL CAMPAIGN.
THAT'S RIGHT. I HOPE. THIS LAW DOES NOTHING TO DEAL WITH THAT. BUT IT DOES DO A VERY GOOD THING WHICH IS IT GIVES PEOPLE FROM THE TREASURY THE MONEY --
Jon: RIGHT.
TO GO BUY HEALTH CARE AT THOSE SAME RIDICULOUS PRICES.
Jon: RIGHT. AND DOES IT NOT ALLEVIATE THE SPENDING ON EMERGENCY ROOM CARE THOUGH WHERE PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE WOULD JUST FLOOD WHEN THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET INSURANCE?
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE INSURANCE, THE HOSPITALS CAN COLLECT MORE MONEY FROM THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN COLLECT IT FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY.
Jon: SO THEY ARE DOING BETTER.
ALL THE HOSPITALS ARE MAKING MUCH MORE MONEY BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
Jon: SON OF A BITCH! ALRIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US.  YOU HAVE A NICE FIX FOR THIS.
GREAT.
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE COME BACK. WE'LL COME BACK. "AMERICA'S BITTER PILL," IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
