WFERN WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN AUTHOR,  HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE  PAT REE ARK, THE TIMES OF JOSEPH P KENNEDY. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DAVID  NASSAW. HELLO, SIR. HOW ARE YOU?
DOING WELL,.
SIR THIS BOOK, THIS  SOMETHING RIGHT HERE. THE PATRIARCH. I'M GOING TO START RIGHT IN  WITH JOSEPH KENNEDY. SO THE BIGGEST PERHAPS I  GUESS MISCONCEPTION THAT I  HAVE IS JOSEPH KENNEDY'S A  BOOTLEGGER. JOSEPH KENNEDY IS ONE OF THE  DUKES OF HAZARD. HE MADE HIS MONEY SLINGING  LIQUOR DURING PROHIBITION,  ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. THE BOOK VERY METICULOUSLY  SAYS --
I WOULD HAVE BEEN  DELIGHTED HAD HE BEEN A  BOOTLEGGER BECAUSE I COULD  HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT MOMOJI AND CANNES BUT HE WASN'T. HE WASN'T. WELL, I CAN'T SAY THAT YOU  CAN NEVER PROVE A NEGATIVE  BUT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO  EVIDENCE. I MEAN THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED  TO MAKE HIM OUT AS A  BOOTLEGGER RELIED ON THE  EVIDENCE GIVEN THEM BY TINA SINATRA WHO HEARD THIRD HAND  FROM HER FATHER THAT HE HAD  DONE THIS DEAL. AL CAPONE'S PIANO TUNER WHO-- .
Jon: YOU HOW DO YOU TRUST  AL CAPONE'S PIANO TUNER,  REALLY, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD AL CAPONE'S PIANO, YOU CALL  THAT A C FLAT, PLEASE,  YOU'RE INSULTING. BUT WHAT YOU DID SHOW THAT  WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS A  BOOTLEGGER THIS MAN DID LIVE ON THE EDGE OF WHAT WE WOULD  CONSIDER TODAY THE ETHICAL  BOUNDARIES OF FINANCE AND  BUSINESS.
I THINK ONE COULD SAY  THAT.
YES, ONE COULD SAY THAT.
YOU DID IN MANY PAGES. BUT NOT ONE TOO MANY. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT  ABOUT HIM WAS THAT WHEN HE  HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO  REFORM THE SAME STOCK MARKET THAT HE HAD MADE MILLIONS  AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS ON  BY SHORT-SELLING, BY POOLING, BY THIS AND THAT AND THIS  AND THAT, EVERY INSIDER  TRICK, ROOSEVELT SAID I WANT  YOU TO BE SECRETARY, I WANT YOU TO BE THE COMMISSIONER  OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE  COMMISSION, HE SAID FINE. HE WAS THERE FOR 15 MONTHS. WHEN HE LEFT HE HAD CLEANED  UP SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NO  LONGER TRADE STOCKS.
YES.
HE WENT INTO REAL ESTATE.
Jon: HE PUT HIMSELF OUT  OF BUSINESS.
HE PUT HIMSELF OUT OF  BUSINESS. EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD DONE  TO MAKE MONEY WAS NOW  OUTLAWED.
Jon: IT REMINDED ME OF  THOSE SHOWS I USED TO GET,  ROBERT WAGNER IS A THIEF AND NOW THE FBI WILL USE HIM TO  LEARN THE TRICKS OF THE  THIEVING. ROOSEVELT REALLY SAID TO  KENNEDY YOU KNOW HOW TO DO  THIS, DOW THIS. IT DID INTERESTING TO ME  THAT THE MAN WHO CREATED  WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY IS THE  MOST BELOVED LIBERAL DYNASTY THAT HAS EVER BEEN CREATED  IN THIS COUNTRY WAS HIMSELF  AN AVATAR OF ALL THAT THAT ESTABLISHMENT SEEKS TO  ABOLISH.
HE BELIEVED IN  CAPITALISM. BUT HE ALSO BELIEVED THAT  UNRESTRAINED, UNRESTRICTED  CAPITALISM WAS GOING TO LEAD TO DISASTER. HE LIVED THROUGH THE RUNNUP  TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION. HE KNEW THE STOCK MARKET WAS  OUT OF CONTROL. HE PULLED HIS MONEY OUT. AND THEN HE BELIEVED THAT  UNLESS SOMETHING WAS DONE TO  REIGN IN PEOPLE LIKE HIM, TO REIGN IN--   (LAUGHTER)  I JUST WOULD HAVE LOVED TO  HAVE BEEN IN THAT MEETING.
YOU DON'T GET T I'M A BAD  GUY. I'VE GOT TO STOP ME. HIM IN FRONT OF A MIRROR.
HE DID STOP HIM AND HE  DID STOP HIM BECAUSE HE NOW  THAT IF THE COUNTRY CONTINUED IN THAT WAY, IF  THE DEPRESSION GOT WORSE  THAN CAPITALISM WOULD BE  THREATENED, DEMOCRACY WOULD BE THREATENED. HIS FORTUNE WOULD BE  THREATENED.
Jon: ULTIMATELY IT WAS  SELF-PRESERVATION. ULTIMATELY HE UNDERSTOOD  THAT THE REASON WHY THE  BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION, THE  COMMUNIST REVOLUTION, THOSE THINGS HAD NOT TAKEN HOLD IN  AMERICA IS THAT WE  AMELIORATED THEM WITH  CERTAIN MOVES THAT COULD HELP WORKERS AND THINGS LIKE  THAT. AND I ALMOST THINK HE SAW IT  AS A HEDGE BET AGAINST HIS  OWN DEMISE.
I THINK SO AND I THINK HE  WAS ALSO SQUARED TO DECHLT I  DON'T THINK WE UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH HARD  TIMES NOW. BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN  FATHOM HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS  AND HOW FRIGHTENING IT WAS TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE  GREAT DEPRESSION WHEN ITALY  AND GERMANY AND THE SOVIET UNION HAD ABANDONED  CAPITALISM AND DEMOCRACY.
Jon: THE OTHER INCREDIBLE  STORY IS IN SOME RESPECTS  HOW KENNEDY TO PUT IT IN STOCK PARLANCE TRIED TO  SHORT THE ALLIES AND GO LONG  WITH HITLER. LIKE THERE IS A CERTAIN  SENSE THAT HE WAS BETTING ON  HITLER WINNING.
HE WAS CONVINCED THAT IF  THE UNITED STATES GOT INTO  THE WAR, IF WE EVEN GOT INTO THE WAR BY SENDING RESOURCES,  MONEY, SUPPLIES TO GREAT  BRITAIN, THE DEPRESSION WAS COMING BACK.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND MISTAKE NUMBER ONE. MISTAKE NUMBER TWO, HE  BELIEVED, MAYBE THIS IS WHY  BUSINESSMEN SHOULDN'T BE IN  POLITICS--  (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S OVER! ROMNEY DIDN'T WIN IT, IT'S  OKAY. YOU CAN STOP.
BUT HE WAS CONVINCED THAT  AS A BUSINESSMAN HE COULD  NEGOTIATE ANYTHING. AND IF HE COULD SIT DOWN  ACROSS THE TABLE FROM ADOLF  HITLER AND SAY ADOLF, WHAT DOES GERMANY NEED, I'LL GET  IT FOR YOU, JUST LET THE  JEWS GO. AND STOP THIS NONSENSE. TAKE WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND  LET'S GO HOME.
Jon: HE WANTED THE JEWS  TO BE LET GO AND WAS GOING  TO SET THEM NEWSPAPER AFRICA SO HE WASN'T THAT FAR OFF. YOU CAN STICK AROUND FOR A  LITTLE BIT. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT THE FAMILY. PATRIARCH IS ON THE BOOK  SHELVES NOW, A LITTLE BIT  MORE FOR THE WEB, DAVID  NASSAW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
