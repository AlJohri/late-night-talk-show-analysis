Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT. ONE OF OUR FAVORITE  MRS. DAVID SEDARIS IS GOING  TO BE JOINING US LATER ON  TONIGHT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: BUT FIRST IF YOU GET  YOUR NEWS FROM THE PRINT  MEDIA YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF THE BIGGEST STORY OF THE  CENTURY.
JODI ARIAS.
JODI ARIAS.
A VERDICT IS REACHED IN  THE TRIAL OF JODI ARIAS.
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT AS  TO COUNT 1 FIRST-DEGREE  MURDER GUILTY.
Jon: AN END TO THE SAGA  THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO  WOULD ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING THEY COULD TO GET OFF JURY  DUTY WERE FIXATED ON FOR 18  WEEKS. IT IS A SAD STORY ALL  AROUND. A YOUNG WOMAN POSSIBLY  FACING THE DEATH PENALTY. THE VICTIM'S FAMILY GETS  JUSTICE BUT IT DOESN'T BRING  BACK THEIR LOVED ONE. NO ONE SHELLISHES --  --  RELISHES A MOMENT LIKE THIS. NOBODY DELIGHTS IN THE  GRUESOME SPECTACLE. NOBODY SLURPS EACH LURID  DETAIL LIKE IT WAS A  PERVERSE JOY, LIKE THEY WERE  AN ENGORGED TRAGEDY TICK. NOBODY WOULD-- WAIT A MINUTE  S THAT NANCY GRACE?
HE WENT TO HIS OWN  BATHROOM MIRROR AND SAW  HIMSELF DYING, AS THE BLOOD WAS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH  AND HIS NOSE.
Jon: YES, ALL HAIL NANCY  FULL OF GRACE. WHEREVER YOU HEAR GAVELS AND  SONING, COURT ELVIRA WILL BE  THERE. THAT'S NOT ROUGE ON HER  CHEEK, SHE DRAWS YOUTH AND  VITALITY FROM HUMAN TRAGEDY. HOW DO I KNOW? HERE SHE IS BEFORE THE ARIAS  TRIAL. YES. (LAUGHTER)  I HADN'T SEEN THAT, ACTUALLY,  PUT UP AGAINST EACH OTHER. THAT IS [BLEEP] UP. BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK  NANCY GRACE'S DESCRIPTION OF  THE MURDER WAS GRUESOME, YOU SHOULD HEAR HER EXPLAIN MASS  TO HER KIDS. IN THIS HE CASE FOUR IS  BRUTALLY RIPPED AWAY FROM 12  LEAVING WHAT? A BLOODY STUMP OF 8. (LAUGHTER)  NANCY GRACE PULLED OUT ALL  THE STOPS FOR THE ARIAS  VERDICT. AND WHO HAS SHE APPARENTLY  HIRED. THIS IS A HELL OF A BOOKING,  PUNDIT NUMBER FOUR, THE  MURDER LADY. THE MURDER LADY IN YOUR BOX. BUT NOW THE VERDICT IS IN,  THE TRIAL IS OVER. WHAT WILL OUR DARK MISTRESS  DO NOW WITH NO  YOUTH-SUSTAINING SHOW TRIAL  TO FEAST ON. PERHAPS SHE'LL JUST RETURN  TO THE CRYPT.
ARIEL CASTRO MAKING HIS  FIRST COURT APPEARANCE. IN ABOUT AN HOUR WE WILL  COVER IT LIVE. DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO SPEAK.
HE MAKES ME SICK. HE MAKES ME SICK.
Jon: HE DOESN'T MAKE YOU  SICK. SO ALIVE. SUCK HIM DRY. BY THE TIME THIS TRIAL IS  OVER YOU ARE GOING LOOK LIKE  THIS. (LAUGHTER)  ANYHEW, AS WE TALKED ABOUT  ON THIS PROGRAM PREVIOUSLY,  REPUBLICANS HAVE FINALLY RELIZED IF THEY WISH TO EVER  GO AGAIN GO TO THE WHITE  HOUSE ON A NONVISITOR PASS BASIS, THEY NEED TO DO I  ABETTER JOB OF APPEALING TO  WOMEN AND MINORITIES. AND BY BETTER JOB, I MEAN  JOB. REALLY, ANY APPEAL TO THEM  WHAT SOPH EVER WOULD HELP. THAT BEING SAID, THAT  DOESN'T MEAN DEMOCRATS CAN  TAKE THEIR LONG-STANDING  RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE GROUPS FOR GRANTED. FOR INSTANCE YOUR SOUTH  CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN  DICK HARPOOTLIAN, LAST WEEK INTRODUCING THE MAN HE HOPES  WILL DEFEAT SOUTH CAROLINA  GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY THROUGH THE PURPOSES OF WHAT ARE YOU  ABOUT TO LEAR IS AN INDIAN  AMERICAN WOMAN.
NOW AT THIS TIME I WOULD  LIKE TO INTRODUCE, NOW DO I  CALL HIM SENATOR OR WOULD I CALL HIM GOVERNOR SHEHEEN W  WHAT I DO CALL HIM? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. AND ABOUT 18 MONTHS FROM NOW  HOPEFULLY HE WILL HAVE SENT  NIKKI HALEY BACK TO WHEREVER THE HELL SHE CAME FROM. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SO LET'S GIVE A WARM  WELCOME TO VINCENT SHE  HAN-- SHEHEEN WHO MUST NOW TACITLY ENDORSE WAY JUST  SAID BY TAKING ITS STAGE. IF HE DID MEAN GO BACK TO  WREFER THE HELL SHE CAME  FROM MEANING INDIA, THAT IS  SURPRISING COMING FROM DICK HARPOOTLIAN A SECRETARY  IMMIGRATION IMMIGRANT FROM  THE COUNTRY OF HAR POOTEL. -- A COUNTRY NAMED OF COURSE  FOR ITS CHIEF EXPORT HARP  POODLES. THAT'S-- OKAY, THAT'S  STUPID. EVERYONE KNOWS A HARP POODLE  IS A CROSS BETWEEN A POODLE  AND A HARP SEAL. YES. (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS WHAT THEY LOOK--   (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW WE'VE COME TO  THE AGE OLD POST  INFLAMMATORY COMMENT RIDDLE. WILL HARPOOTLIAN SEEK HIM  OUT OR BURY HIM FURTHER.
I APOLOGIZE, YESTERDAY IF  ANYONE INFERRED, I MEAN I'M  THE GRANDSON OF IMMIGRANTS. I CERTAINLY WASN'T-- SHE'S  NOT FROM INDIA. SHE'S FROM BAMBURG, SOUTH  CAROLINA WHERE SHE WAS AN  ACCOUNTANT IN HER PARENT'S  CLOTHING STORE CALLED  EXOTICA. AND ALL I'M SUGGESTING IS  SHE NEEDS TO GO BACK TO  BEING AN ACCOUNTANT IN A  DRESS STORE.
Jon: HE WASN'T DOING THE  NATIVIST GO BACK TO WHERE  YOU CAME FROM, FOREIGNER. HE WAS DOING THE CHAUVINIST  LADIES BELONG KEEPING THE  BOOKS IN DRESS STORES. (LAUGHTER)  APOLOGY ACCEPTED. SOUTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC  PARTY CHAIRMAN HARPOOTLIAN,  YOU'RE LOSING WOMEN. NORTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATIC  CHAIRMAN PARTY CHAIRMAN,  SHOW HIM HOW IT IS DONE.
HE WAS SPEAKING TO THE  DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF GUILFORD  COUNTY LAST NIGHT. WELL, IT THIS TWEET CAUSED  QUITE A STIR. THE GOP THAT IS LEADING US,  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE  TAKING US BUT THEY'RE RAPING US ALONG THE WAY, HE  REPORTEDLY SAID.
Jon: AM I RIGHT, LADIES,  RAPING US, RIGHT, RIGHT! SHE KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT. THEY'RE RAPING US! OF COURSE HE LATER  APOLOGIZED WITH THE FAMED  NOT INTENDING TO OFFEND AND  EXPLAINED WHY IT WAS AN APT AND APPROPRIATE METAPHOR FOR  HIM TO USE IN FRONT OF A  WOMEN'S GROUP BY SAYING  WOMEN AND MEN WITH BATT VICTIMS OF ABUSE AND-- I  PERSONALLY COULD HAVE BEEN  RAPED. SO I GUESS WE'RE ALL GOOD,  HOW, LADIES? HERE'S HOW WE KNOW YOU  PROBABLY HAVEN'T BEEN RAPED. YOU USED THE TERM TO  DESCRIBE POLITICAL POLICIES  YOU DISAGREE WITH. WHICH BRINGS TO US OUR FINAL  DEMOCRATIC ENT RAN.
NEIGHBORS HERE ARE  CALLING FOR THE RESIGNATION  OF TOWNSHIP CLERK DOLLARIA PLAQUEO, PLAQUEO WAS  REPORTED CALLING SUPERVISOR  DWAYNE PARKER THE "N" WORD. FLATCO IS APOLOGIZING FOR  WHAT SHE CALLS A SLIP OF THE  TONGUE.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT I FOUND  ABOUT THE N WORD, PRETTY  HARD TO SAY. DOESN'T JUST SLIP OUT UNLESS  YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF  PRACTICE. BUT LET'S HEAR THE TAPE.
HE'S JUST RUBBING ME THE  WRONG WAY. HE IS JUST DOING WHATEVER HE  CAN. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF  MR. -- RIGHT NOW, I KNOW ARE  YOU NOT EVEN GOING LIKE THIS HE'S JUST AN ARROGANT  NIGGER.
Jon: IF THAT WAS THE SLIP  OF THE TONGUE WHAT WERE YOU  TRYING TO SAY? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE  THIS, HE'S AN EXTRAVAGANT  GOLD DIGGER. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE  HEARING THIS, HE'S A HARROWING  TIGGER, SHE'S AN ASTRONAUT  NINJA. SCREENPLAY IDEA, ASTRONAUT  NINJAS. ZERO GRAVITY. ZERO RULES. (LAUGHTER)  BUT OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A SLIP  OF THE TONGUE BECAUSE YOU  KNOW, THIS LADY SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT, RIGHT.
I HAVE EATEN THANKSGIVING  DINNER WITH BLACK FRIENDS AT  THEIR HOUSE, SO NO, I'M FAR FROM BECOME PREJUDICED.
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO SAY  ANYTHING BUT PRETTY MUCH AT  EVERY THANKSGIVING I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE IS ALWAYS  AT LEAST ONE RACIST AT THE  TABLE SO IF YOU ARE AT  THANKSGIVING AND DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE THERE IS RACIST,  YOU'RE THE RACIST. BY THE WAY, HERE'S MY  IMPRESSION--   (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HERE'S MY IMPRESSION  AT THANKSGIVING AT THE HOME  OF GLORIA PLATKO'S BLACK  FRIEND.
GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF MY  HOUSE! (LAUGHTER)  JUST A LITTLE ADVICE TO  DEMOCRATS, ON YOUR WAY HOME  TONIGHT MAYBE PICK UP A BOUQUET OF ROSES OR TWO  BECAUSE I DONE THINK WOMEN  AND MINORITIES ARE GOING TO  LEAVE YOU JUST YET BUT I WOULDN'T GET
