Jon:  WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT A PROFESSOR AT THE HARVARD LAW SCHOOL THERE, ALSO A LEGAL SCHOLAR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WISER:  GETTING BEYOND GROUP THINK TO MAKE GROUPS SMARTER." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, CASS SUNSTEIN. SIR! YOUNG MAN.
THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR.
Jon: PLEASE. COME. SIT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: MY FIRST QUESTION IS THIS -- THIS IS BLURRY, RIGHT? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BLURRY?
YEAH, THAT'S INTENTIONAL. SO YOU FOCUS.
Jon: OH, THANK GOD. ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT, OKAY, I AM OLD, BUT I AM NOT THAT OLD. GROUP THINK, NOW, YOU'VE WORKED A LOT ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION, ON SMARTER GOVERNMENT. GROUP THINK IS A SEPARATE ENTITY, A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM THAT. BUT YOU HAVE THIS FASCINATING STUDY IN HERE ABOUT THESE GROUPS IN COLORADO, ONE IN BOULDER, ONE IN COLORADO SPRINGS.
RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED IS WE GOT A BUNCH OF LIBERALS IN BOULDER TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, SAME-SEX RELATIONS AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.
Jon: YES.
JUST THE LIBERALS TOGETHER AND HAD THEM TALK TO EACH OTHER. AND AS THEY TALKED, THEY GOT MORE AND MORE TO THE LEFT. WE DID THE SAME THING IN COLORADO SPRINGS. WE GOT CONSERVATIVES, PEOPLE WHO TEND TO LIKE VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY --
Jon: YES.
TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUES, AND AS THEY TALKED, THEY GOT MORE AND MORE TO THE RIGHT. SO WHAT HAPPENED IS BEFORE THE LIKEMINDED --
Jon: HOW DO YOU GET MORE TO THE RIGHT OF DICK CHENEY? ( LAUGHTER ).
WELL WE DIDN'T ASK THEM "ARE YOU TO THE RIGHT OF DICK CHENEY?" WE ASKED THEM, "WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?"
Jon: I SEE. I SEE.
AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS BEFORE THEY STARTED TO TALK IN GROUPS OF LIKE-MINDED TYPES, THEY COULD DEAL. THEY COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER. BUT WHEN THE COLORADO SPRINGS PEOPLE TALKED ONLY TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS PEOPLE, AND WHEN THE BOULDER PEOPLE TALKED TO ONLY THE BOULDER PEOPLE, IT WAS IT AS IF THEY WERE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
Jon: AND HOW -- SO, WHEN YOU PUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL GROUPS, WHEN THEY FIRST GOT TOGETHER, THEY WERE NOT STRIDENTLY IDEOLOGICAL? THEY WERE NOT DOGMATIC? BUT THEY BECAME THAT WAY?
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY WERE DIVERSE. SO JUST LIKE IN ANY TOWN THAT TENDS CONSERVATIVE OR THAT TENDS LIBERAL, YOU'LL HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE FAR RIGHT, SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE FAR LEFT. THEY WON'T ALL BE EXTREME. WHAT HAPPENED WAS A SHORT DISCUSSION OF THESE THREE ISSUES --
Jon: WITH EACH OTHER.
WITH EACH OTHER MADE THE CONSERVATIVES MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE, MADE THE LIBERALS MUCH MORE LIBERAL.
Jon:  SO IS THE LESSON HERE TO NOT HAVE CONGRESS CAUCUS WITH EACH OTHER?
I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A LITTLE TOO STRONG, BUT I THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING JUST TO LIKE-MINDED ARE OTHERS TO THINK TO THEMSELVES THE INFORMATION WE'RE GETTING FOR EACH OTHER MAYBE ISN'T THE FULL UNIVERSE OF INFORMATION THERE IS. SO IF YOU GET STIRRED UP THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX OR SOME GROUP OF PEOPLE IS TERRIBLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT RELIGION OR SOMETHING.
Jon: RIGHT.
IT MAY WELL BE THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THERE'S A LITTLE ECHO CHAMBER.
Jon:  IS IT THAT THEY ALL GO TO THE RIGHT OF THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL INDIVIDUAL OF THE GROUP? IS IT-- DOES IT ONLY WORK THAT WAY IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE GROUP THAT IS A TENT POST DOGMATIC INDIVIDUAL THAT DRIVES PEOPLE OVER THERE? OR NO MATTER WHAT, IT GOES IN THAT DIRECTION?
THERE IS SOME VARIETY, AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS GO TO THE MOST EXTREME. IT'S JUST THAT THE MEDIAN AFTER THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER IS MORE EXTREME THAN THE MEDIAN BEFORE THEY TALKED TO EACH OTHER.
Jon: DOES THIS WORK WITH ANYTHING? DOES THIS WORK WITH RELIGION? IF YOU PUT FIVE REFORMED JEWS IN A ROOM, DO THEY COME OUT WITH PEYOS? LIKE HOW, HOW DOES THAT, YOU KNOW, HOW DOES THAT, HOW DOES THAT WORK? AND HOW DO YOU MITIGATE THAT? I GUESS THEY WOULD CALL THAT EPISTEMIC CLOSURE.
YEAH. WELL, WE HAVEN'T DONE IT WITH THE IN THE CASE YOU'RE DESCRIBING SO I DON'T KNOW THE RESULT OF THAT ONE --
Jon: YOU, YOU CAN SAY THE WORD "JEW." IT'S NOT A -- YOU KNOW. YEAH. ( LAUGHTER )
BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT THIS IS A REGULARITY. IT'S BEEN FOUND IN A DOZEN COUNTRIES OR MORE. IT HAPPENS AMONG PEOPLE IN FRANCE WHO ARE SUSPICIOUS OF THE UNITED STATES AFTER THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER, THEY GET A LOT MORE SUSPICIOUS. PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED ABOUT BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKFORCE. IF THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER, THEY GET MORE OUTRAGED. THE BEST WAY TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING BY THE WAY --
Jon: YEAH.
IS EITHER TO USE DATA AND EVIDENCE AND TO KIND OF INSERT THAT IN OR TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T JUST TALKING TO LIKE-MINDED TYPES.
Jon: NOW I HAVE SEEN, THOUGH, THAT PEOPLE HAVE STUDIED WHEN YOU INTRODUCE DATA AND EVIDENCE IT ALMOST HARDENS THE IDEOLOGICAL OR THE DOGMATIC INDIVIDUAL. ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE, YOU CAN BRING IN PEOPLE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF IT. THE MINUTE YOU INTRODUCE DATA, OR VACCINES, THEY HARDEN IN THEIR POSITION AND REFUSE TO ADDRESS IT.
YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT. SO IF WE HAVE AN ISSUE THAT IS IDEOLOGICALLY VERY INFLAMED, ONCE PEOPLE HEAR DATA THAT CONFLICTS WITH WHAT THEY ALREADY THOUGHT, THEY EITHER GET THEY'RE BACK UP AND START REACTING, "THAT HAS TO BE WRONG BECAUSE IT'S DISTURBING MY DEEPEST BELIEF." OR THEY THINK, "WHY WOULD THEY DENY MY BELIEF IF I WEREN'T RIGHT?"
Jon:  SO PEOPLE ARE THE WORST. ( LAUGHTER ) WE'RE THE WORST.
WELL --
Jon: SO HOW DO YOU-- THIS SEEMS LIKE -- SO BASICALLY, ALMOST WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS IT IS HUMAN NATURE TO HARDEN YOUR POSITION WHEN YOU SURROUND YOURSELF BY LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS. SO THIS SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF PERPETUAL EMOTION MACHINE.
OKAY, HERE'S A STORY FROM THE FOUNDING OF THE CONSTITUTION.
Jon: WELL, I LOVE A NICE STORY.
THIS IS, WHEN THE CONSTITUTION WAS STARTED THERE WAS A PROPOSAL TO HAVE AS OUR FIRST AMENDMENT, SOMETHING WHICH WOULD GIVE CONSTITUENTS THE RIGHT TO INSTRUCT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, AND THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WAS DEFEATED ON THE GROUND ARTICULATED BY THE EARLY GENERATION THAT WE WANT DIVERSE PEOPLE IN OUR CONGRESS WHO ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LEARNING FROM ONE ANOTHER, AND THE RIGHT TO INSTRUCT WOULD DEFEAT THE POINT OF THE MEETING. SO I THINK THAT'S A PROFOUND LESSON ABOUT HOW IF YOU ARE THINKING THAT YOUR JOB IS TO LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELF --
Jon: YEAH.
THEN YOU CAN BREAK THIS LITTLE AMPLIFICATION MACHINE WE'RE DESCRIBING. AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IN THE MOVEMENT FOR SEX EQUALITY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, WHERE PRESIDENT NIXON WAS ACTUALLY A HERO. AND PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS THE ARCHITECT REALLY OF THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL, WHICH PRESERVED THE OZONE LAYER. THAT WAS DATA DRIVEN AND GETTING DIVERSE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.
Jon:  YOU NEED ONE REBEL IN THE GROUP. YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO HAS DOGMATIC CREDIBILITY, IDEOLOGICAL CREDIBILITY, BUT WHO WILL STAND ON A PRINCIPLE BEYOND THEM. IS THAT THE WAY TO BREAK THE SPELL? THE HEX?
THAT'S ONE WAY. DATA CAN WORK IF PEOPLE AREN'T IDEOLOGICALLY REALLY INVESTED. BUT IF THERE'S AN ISOLATED DISSENTER, SOMETIMES THAT CAN REDUCE CONFORMITY PRESSURES AND GET GROUP THINK DEFEATED.
Jon: OR WE JUST KEEP PEOPLE APART. THAT'S THE OTHER THING. YOU KEEP PEOPLE APART. YOU DON'T LET PEOPLE GATHER. THEY LIVE IN PODS. PEOPLE LIVE IN PODS AND ARE FED THROUGH A TUBE. YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA THINK, CASS. SOLUTIONS, MY FRIEND. "WISER" IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. READ IT ALONE. CASS SUNSTEIN. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
