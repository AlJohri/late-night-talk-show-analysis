JULY 13, 2011 FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR MATTHEW RICHARDSON. HE IS AUTHOR OF A BOOK ABOUT FANNIE MAE AND FREDDY IMAGINE AND -- FREDDIE MAC AND WHY THE  TWO SHU NEVER HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED. REPUBLICAN MICHEL BACHMANN HAS SURGED ABOVE PRESIDENT OBAMA. THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS PROGROWTH AGENDA, ADHERENCE TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS PRINCIPLES AND  SOMETHING SPECIAL.
ANALYSTS SAY HER UNCOMPROMISING VIEWS ON HOMOSEXUALITY ARE ONE OF BIG  REASONS SHE'S GAINING TRACTION IN IOWA.
Jon: WHAT? WHY WOULD IOWANS BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS THREE INCHES BELOW THE CORN BELT? [LAUGHTER] SINCE THE IOWA SUPREME COURT LEGALIZED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN 2009 THEY'VE NOTICED REAL  CHANGES IN THE STATE'S CASH CROP! [LAUGHTER] YES, THEIR WORST FEARS CORN DESTROYED BY A (bleep) PLAYING. [LAUGHTER] A -- (bleep) PLAGUE. MOVIE ABOUT IOWA FIELD OF -- IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL -- YOU KNOW. [LAUGHTER] IT'S NO SURPRISING THE MESSAGE IS RESONATING TO CONSERVATIVES THERE. UNLESS YOU THINK SHE'S PANDERING REST APRIL SURED SHE'S BE ON THIS MESSAGE FOR YEARS.
IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THE GAY AND LESBIAN LIFESTYLE IT'S BONDAGE. IT'S PERSONAL BONDAGE, PERSONAL DESPAIR AND ENSLAVEMENT. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO DANGEROUS. IT'S A SAD LIFE. IT'S PART OF SATAN TO SAY THIS IS GAY. IT'S ANYTHING BUT GAY.
Jon: IF I WERE TO USE A WORD FOR THEIR LIFESTYLE I'D SAY IT WAS QUEER. WHAT THEY TOOK THAT WORD, TOO? OH, GOD. THOSE (bleep). THEY'VE GOT THAT ONE, TOO? [LAUGHTER] REPRESENTATIVE BACHMANN DOESN'T JUST TALK THE TALK. SHE AND HER HUSBAND WALK THE WALK. DR. BACHMANN RUNS A CHRISTIAN COUNSELING TERM THAT PRACTICES REPAIRA ACTIVE THERAPY OR PRAY  THE GAY AWAY. WHY HE DENIES IT SOME FOCIALER PATIENTS REMEMBER THINGS DIFFERENTLY.
HIS PATH FOR MY THERAPY WOULD BE TO READ THE BIBLE AND PRAY THAT -- TO GOD THAT I WOULD NO  LONGER BE GAY.
IF NONE AFTER THIS WORKED, RAMIREZ SAYS THE COUNSELOR HAD ANOTHER IDEA.
HE SUGGESTED TO YOU, WHAT?
NOT ACTING OUT ON MY SAME-SEX ATTRACTIONS AND LIVING A LIFE OF SELL BASIS. -- SELL SEL DE LA TERRE -- CELIxD CELIBACY.
Jon: HE ALWAYS PRESCRIBED A MEDICAL COCKTAIL WITH A SIDE EFKS OF A FOUR HOUR ERECTION AND  I WASN'T GOING TO LET THAT GO AWAY. WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE MAN HIMSELF DR. BACHMANN SEEN HERE DANCING WITH HIS WIFE. WAIT A MINUTE, CAN WE COME BACK HERE? THAT IS MICHELE BACHMANN'S HUSBAND? [LAUGHTER] THAT IS -- THAT IS THE GUY TEACHING PEOPLE NOT TO BE GAY? SERIOUSLY? IS HE -- IS THAT THE GUY --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IS HE -- IS HE TEACHING PEOPLE NOT TO BE GAY OR IS LIKE THE GREEN MILE GUY AND JUST  ABSORBING IT ALL? NO, NO, I'M NOT GOING THERE. DON'T -- DON'T GO THERE, JON. JUST REPRESS IT. EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE FEELING A DEEP DESIRE TO COMICALLY EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT THIS MAN IS AN  IZOD SHIRT AWAY FROM BEING THE GAY CHARACTER ON "MODERN FAMILY."  OF COURSE ONE OF THEM IS JUST A STRAIGHT MAN PRETENDING TO BE GAY. DON'T DO THAT, JON! JUST BECAUSE DR. BACHMANN'S THERAPY TO CURE GAYNESS DOES REAL DAMAGE TO REAL PEOPLE AND  HE IS SEEMINGLY CURING THEM SO YOU CAN HOARD ALL THE GAYNESS FOR HIMSELF --  [LAUGHTER] -- THAT IS NO REASON TO LET YOUR PRIMAL URGE TO RIDICULE THIS SEEMING HYPOCRISY OUT. LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH, TURN IT OFF! THE FEELING WILL PASS. THE FEELING -- ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? EVERYONE LOOKS GAYER WHEN THEY ARE DANCING ANYWAY. LET'S JUST HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN YOUR TEENAGER SAYS SHE'S GAY?
THERE'S THAT CURIOSITY BUT AGAIN WE LIKE -- YOU KNOW, IT IS  AS IF WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND BARBARIANS NEED TO BE EDUCATED. THEY NEED BE DISCIPLINED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: REALLY? FIRST OF ALL GAY TEENAGERS ARE BARBARIANS WHO NEED BE EDUCATED YOU MM -- SUPPRESS IT. DISCIPLINE. EVEN THOUGH I THINK THIS MAN'S VIEWS ARE TERRIBLE AND HE DANCES AND SOUNDS NOT ONLY GAY BUT  CENTERSQUARE GAY, I'M -- YOU KNOW WHAT, I REALIZE THIS IS BIGGER THAN I AM. I CAN'T FIGHT THIS ON MY OWN. I NEED A HIGHER POWER SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS, WHO UNDERSTANDS MY STRUGGLES. I WISH THAT SOMEONE COULD --
