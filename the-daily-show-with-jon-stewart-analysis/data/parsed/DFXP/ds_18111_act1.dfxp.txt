Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: WELCOME TO DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GUEST TONIGHT, WE HAVE A GOOD  ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT JON FAVREAU WHO  IS EITHER ACCLAIMED DIRECTOR OF  IRONMAN OR THE FORMER CHIEF'S SPEECH WRITER OF PRESIDENT  OBAMA. I DO NOT KNOW AND I HAVE NOT  ASKED. WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHT  ACROSS THE HUDSON RIVER WHERE  LONG-TIME NEW JERSEY SENATOR FRANK LAUDENBERG SADLY HAS  PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF 89  LEAVING MY HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY TEMPORARILY  UNREPRESENTED. YES, MY HOME STATE, NEW JERSEY. YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS. BUY BOURGEOIS PRONUNCIATION, MY  TASTE FOR EXOTIC SEX BOYS THAT I  MAY SEEM LIKE A SOME PHYSICIAN TICKED AND URBANE NEW YORKER BUT  AT HEART I'M JUST A JERSEY BOY  NOSTALGIC FOR THE GARDEN STATE'S WINDING COUNTRY ROADS. HISTORIC CART-A-COMBS. AND AMBER WAVES OF PIZZA. YOU KNOW, MY GRANDFATHER... [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] BEAUTIFUL IT IS. MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO THIS  COUNTRY, WORKED NIGHT AND DAY IN  THE PIZZA FIELDS JUST SO HE COULD FEED HIS FAMILY. IRONICALLY. ANYWAY, MY BELOVED STATE FINDS  ITSELF ONE SENATOR DOWN. NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE HAS THREE OPTIONS.
GOVERNOR DECIDES TO SET A  SPECIAL ELECTION SOMETIME THIS  FALL. IT COULD BE HELD ON NOVEMBER 5.
AND THE THIRD WAS TO DO IT IN  NOVEMBER 2014, HAVE A  PLACE-HOLDER UNTIL THEN.
Jon: OR NUMBER FOUR, DRIVE  FIVE GUYS IN A VAN DOWN TO THE  PINE BARRENS AT MIDNIGHT. BY THE TIME MORNING COMES, YOU  GOT ONE SENATOR IN THE CAR. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? PLENTY OF LEG ROOM. IT'S A VAN. SO, APPOINT SOMEONE... APPOINT  SOMEONE. WHAT? IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT HE HAD  TAKEN AT SEARS. WE CAN APPOINT SOMEONE UNTIL  LAUTENBERG'S TERM WOULD BE UP  WHICH IS NOVEMBER 2014 OR YOU FILL THE SEAT SOONER DURING THE  ALREADY SCHEDULED NOVEMBER 2013  GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION. I'LL TELL YOU THE ONE OPTION  HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE, THAT  WEIRD OCTOBER SPECIAL ELECTION. YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT IS GOING  TO HAPPEN THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE  GENERAL? I KNOW HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT  BECAUSE IN 2009 GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE COMMENTED SPOAFL ON WHAT HE WOULD DO WHEN HE WAS  ASKED -- AND THIS IS TRUE IF  FRANK LAUTENBERG DIED.
I THINK ANY RESPONSIBLE WOULD  CALL FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION THAT  WOULD COST $10 MILLION.
Jon: OF COURSE THEY WOULDN'T. A RESPONSIBLE GOVERNOR WOULDN'T  DO THAT. THE ONLY KIND OF GOVERNOR WHO  WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE THAT  WOULD BE ONE OF THE LEAST RESPONSIBLE ONES. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, THE  HONORABLE [BLEEP]. THAT'S RIGHT. ARE YOU ALLOWED TO DO THAT? SO, WHY DO WE BOTHER PUTTING  ASTERISKS AND THINGS IN THE  NAME. HE IS THE FINGER. ANYWAY, WHAT DID GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE CHOOSE.
HE SAID A SPECIAL ELECTION  FOR OCTOBER 16.
Jon: WHAT THE DEVIL? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE CHOSE THE IRRESPONSIBLE THREE  WEEKS BEFORE THE GENERAL  ELECTION $10 MILLION SPECIAL  ELECTION?
THE SPECIAL ELECTION  ESTIMATED TO COST NEARLY $24  MILLION. (CROWD GROANING).
Jon: $24 MILLION. ACTUALLY IT'S PROBABLY ONLY  ABOUT $12 MILLION BECAUSE YOU DO  HAVE TO HAVE A PRIMARY NO MATTER  WHAT. STILL, $12 MILLION.
THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH  HAVING A SPECIAL PRIMARY AND  GENERAL ELECTION IN MY MIND CANNOT BE MEASURED AGAINST THE  VALUE OF HAVING AN ELECTED  REPRESENTATIVE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WITH SO MANY  CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES ARE BEING  DEBATED.
Jon: 2009? AND THEN. AND YOU'RE ONLY GAINING THREE  WEEKS OF CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE  ELECTEDDED REPRESENTATION. THE KEY PHRASE THERE IS "IN THE  SENATE."  THREE WEEKS OF WORK IN THE  SENATE IS BASICALLY 28 LOBBYISTS MEET-AND-GREET H.14 DAYS OF OLD  MAN SMELL ACCLAMATION AND SIX  FILIBUSTERS. YOU'RE PAYING $4 MILLION A WEEK. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, CHRIS  CHRISTIE?
CRITICS SAY THE DECISION IS  ALL ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE  INSISTING THE GOVERNOR JUST WANTS TO KEEP NEWARK MAYOR CORY  BOOKER NOW THE DEMOCRATIC  FAVORITE TO WIN THE SENATE RACE OFF THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. THE BIG DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT FOR  BOOKER COULD HELP CHRIS  CHRISTIE'S OPPONENT.
Jon: THAT IS SUCH A CORRUPT  ABUSE OF POWER. I MISS NEW JERSEY SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IT'S JUST HARD TO SEE CORRUPT  ABUSE OF POWER AND NOT THINK  ABOUT IT AT ALL. THE MAN I GUESS GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE MUST REALLY BE NERVOUS  ABOUT HIS GUBERNATORIAL  OPPONENT. WHO IS THAT AGAIN?
LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS GUY IS BONO. I'M BARBARA BUONO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: YOU'RE SPENDING $12  MILLION. OF TAX PAYER MONEY TO BEAT THAT  LADY. BARBARA BUONO.
I'M BARBARA BUONO. Jon: I'M TALKING TO CHRIST-Y  OVER HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, GOVERNOR. YOU'RE ALREADY UP 32 POINTS IN  THE POLLS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO WIN. YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND $12  MILLION EXTRA TAX PAYER DOLLARS  TO MAKE SURE YOU BEAT THE  SPREAD. YOUR WHOLE REPUTATION IS  SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT PROTECTING  NEW JERSEY TAX PAYERS.
ARE YOU STUPID? I'M SORRY FOR THE IDIOTS OVER  THERE.
Jon: I'M WITH THAT GUY. WE'LL BE RIGHT
