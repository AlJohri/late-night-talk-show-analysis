[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE HOST OF CNN'S "FAREED ZAKARIA GPS." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO OUR PROGRAM FAREED ZAKARIA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
I'M WELL. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, BECAUSE I REALIZE I MIGHT BE SPEAKING TO MY FUTURE BOSS.
Jon: YES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? OUR FAKE KICK STARTER TO BUY CNN IS UP TO $150 BILLION NOW. PEOPLE ARE PLEDGING $10 BILLION, $15 BILLION, $20 BILLION. I MEAN, WHEN WE CHARGE THEIR CREDIT CARDS, I HAVE A FEELING WE'LL BE DISAPPOINTED.
BUT I THINK, I, I HOPE THAT YOU, THAT YOU END UP GETTING CNN. I THINK IT WOULD BE A FASCINATING CHALLENGE FOR YOU. NO, IT'S TRUE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.
I THINK YOU'D LOVE IT. I MEAN, BECAUSE YOU DO AN AMAZING JOB. YOU PROGRAM HALF AN HOUR.
Jon: 22 MINUTES.
22 MINUTES.
Jon: 22 MINUTES, BUT I DO IT FOUR DAYS A WEEK.
I'LL GIVE YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU THE OTHER EIGHT MINUTES.
Jon: AND IT'S KILLING ME.
SO THAT'S TWO HOURS OF PROGRAMMING A WEEK.
Jon: RIGHT.
RIGHT? CNN HAS 24 HOURS TIMES SEVEN...
Jon: SURE.
168 HOURS.
Jon: YEAH, BUT I'LL DO WHAT CNN DOES. I'LL JUST LET WOLF BLITZER FILL IN THE REST OF THE 18 HOURS. [LAUGHTER] I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT... YOU HAVE WRITTEN RECENTLY, THIS IS NOT THE WORST TIME IN HISTORY. EXPLAIN YOURSELF. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, YOU KNOW, JON, IT WAS RIFFING OFF A SPEECH JOHN McCAIN MADE, ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES.
Jon: WHO? [LAUGHTER]
AND HE SAID THAT THIS IS THE MOST TERRIBLE, YOU KNOW, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SITUATION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFETIME, AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND I JUST THOUGHT WE NEEDED SOME PERSPECTIVE THAT, YOU KNOW, DURING THE COLD WAR, THE SUPERPOWERS HAD 45,000 NUCLEAR MISSILES POINTED AT EACH OTHER.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE WENT, WE WENT TO WAR IN VIETNAM WHERE WE LOST 50, WHATEVER IT WAS, ALMOST 60,000 AMERICANS, BUT THE VIETNAMESE LOST THREE MILLION BY SOME COUNTS, AT LEAST ONE MILLION. THERE WAS THE 1973 WAR BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL. WE WENT UP TO DEFCON THREE, WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, THE HIGHEST STATE OF ALERT OTHER THAN THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME PRETTY TOUGH STUFF. YES...
Jon: WE FOUGHT A CIVIL WAR, WE, WE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
YOU MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN, THAT WASN'T DURING McCAIN'S LIFETIME. IT DOES SEEM, IT DOES SEEM THAT WAY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND THE MISTAKE.
Jon: HE'S GOING TO LOVE THAT.
SO, SO THE POINT I WAS MAKING WAS WE'RE FACING SERIOUS, COMPLICATED ISSUES. THE RUSSIA DOING WHAT IT'S DOING IN CRI --
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE RUSSIANS INVADED CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN '68, AND HUNGARY IN '56. THERE WERE TWO RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO SQUASH, YOU KNOW, THEIR SATELLITES. WE'RE GOING THROUGH TOUGH STUFF, BUT LET'S NOT START TALKING ABOUT HOW, OH MY GOD, YOU KNOW, THE WORLD IS COLLAPSING, WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AND THAT DID SEEM VERY PARTISAN RATHER THAN SOME KIND OF AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION.
Jon: FROM McCAIN.
WELL...
Jon: UNUSUAL FOR HIM.
WELL, AS YOU KNOW, HE USED TO BE... THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MCCAIN WAS, WAS DIFFERENT.
Jon: YEAH, NO. HE GOT BIT BY A MOSQUITO OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THAT GUY, BUT WOULDN'T YOU SAY... IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF THE ISSUE IS INSTABILITY IS MUCH EASIER. TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT SO THAT INSTABILITY IS EASIER TO CREATE. IT TAKES LESS MONEY AND LESS PEOPLE TO CREATE INSTABILITY IN REGIONS THAN IT USED TO BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON RELATIVELY SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS.
YEAH, THIS IS THE BIG CHANGE IN A SENSE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF VIOLENCE, YOU KNOW.
Jon: YES.
TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT SO THAT YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS PLANE. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE EVEN TEN YEARS AGO I THINK FOR SMALL GROUP OF THUGS TO FIRE A MISSILE THAT COULD GO 33,000 FEET UP IN THE AIR AND TAKE OUT A CIVILIAN AIRLINER.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU COULD GET TO LOWER-FLYING AIRCRAFT. YOU COULD GET TO HELICOPTERS.
Jon: AND THEY HAVE THOSE SHOULDER MISSILES.
RIGHT. AND THERE WAS SHOULDER AND...
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IS IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE BACK OF A TRUCK. YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHICH HAS A RADAR THAT IS PRETTY SOPHISTICATED. NOW, HERE'S THE CATCH, IT'S SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO TELL YOU THAT THERE'S AN AIRLINER AND YOU CAN HIT IT. IT CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER IT'S CIVILIAN OR MILITARY. FOR THAT YOU NEED TO BE PLUGGED INTO A MUCH WIDER RADAR SYSTEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, IT SHOWS YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO BE REALLY RESPONSIBLE AND NIHILISTIC. AND THAT'S...
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S THE DANGER.
Jon: AND, THAT'S THE DANGER. AND THEN INSTAGRAM IT AS SOON AS YOU DID IT. LIKE THAT'S...
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DOING THIS THING NOW WHERE THEY WEAVE CHAOS AND THEN POST IT.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THAT SEEMS TO BE THEIR METHODOLOGY. AND THEN THAT CATCHES FIRE AMONGST OTHER DISAFFECTED GROUPS. SO DOESN'T THAT THROW INTO... THIS ENTIRE PARADIGM OF AMERICAN POWER THAT SUPPRESSES THESE POCKETS OF INSTABILITY IS ENTIRELY BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER, THIS IDEA THAT, OH, IF WE JUST CHANGE REGIMES WE WILL STABILIZE COUNTRIES. WHAT WE SEE NOW IS, WE SOW CHAOS.
WELL, IT SHOWS YOU THAT ANYONE TRYING TO DO IT, IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. LOOK...
Jon: RIGHT. BUT NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO TRY TO DO IT.
NO, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING IN THEIR OWN WAY...
Jon: RIGHT.
TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS INSTABILITY, AND EVEN WITH THE BRUTAL MECHANISM THEY'RE USING, IT'S NOT WORKING. THE RUSSIANS TRIED IT IN CHECHNYA, THEY MANAGED TO DO IT, KILLED 250,000 CIVILIANS IN DOING IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT YOU, FUNDAMENTALLY...
Jon: WELL, ISRAEL FACES THE SAME THING.
IT DOES. EXACTLY.
Jon: THEY THINK THAT OVERWHELMING FORCE WILL BE THE ONLY THING...
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THEN THE PEOPLE IN THAT AREA WHO ARE TRAPPED WHO ARE NOT PART OF HAMAS...
RIGHT.
Jon: OR NOT A PART OF THIS INSURRECTION ARE DEVASTATED.
RIGHT. THE COST OF DISRUPTION HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE COST OF ESTABLISHING ORDER OF SOME KIND IS INCREDIBLY HIGH. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IRAQ, YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, WELL, IF WE HAD STAYED THERE, WOULD THAT REALLY, WOULD 5,000 AMERICAN TROOPS MANAGED TO TURN THIS AROUND, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY.
Jon: RIGHT. 100,000 DIDN'T GET IT TO THE LEVEL OF STABILITY THAT'S REQUIRED BY SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: IN YOUR MIND, IS THIS NOW THEN THE NEW NORMAL THAT WE LIVE WITH IS POCKETS OF INSTABILITY THAT CREATE THESE CONFLAGRATIONS RATHER THAN SORT OF WORLD CONFLICTS?
WELL, I THINK THE CRUCIAL ISSUE IS WHERE THE STATE HAS LOST LEGITIMACY. AND YOU SEE THAT IN THE BROADER MIDDLE EAST. YOU KNOW,  IF YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST, 20 YEARS AGO FROM LIBYA, TUNISIA, EGYPT, IRAQ, SYRIA, YOU HAD A STABLE ORDER, BUT IT WAS BASED ON REPRESSION.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THE LEGITIMACY OF ALL THOSE REGIMES IS GONE. AND WHAT IT TURNS OUT IS THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING THOSE COUNTRIES TOGETHER. SO PEOPLE ARE PULLING BACK TO THEIR DEEPER ROOTS, SHIA, SUNNI, KURD.
Jon: DIFFERENT IDENTITIES, TRIBAL AND RELIGIOUS.
AND IN THAT SITUATION, I THINK IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP THE STATE TOGETHER. I DON'T THINK IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S A PROBLEM IN PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE A COHERENT NATIONAL IDENTITY AND THE STATE IS SEEN AS LEGITIMATE.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THERE WILL BE THOSE POCKETS, AND THOSE I THINK YOU'LL JUST HAVE A WORLD OF THOSE BADLANDS.
Jon: SO, THE NEW STATUS QUO IS WARLORDS AND A MORE FEUDAL SYSTEM AND A BALKANIZATION...
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THE REST OF US JUST HAVE TO HOPE THAT NOBODY THERE GETS A NUKE.
AND... RIGHT. AND, DON'T GO THERE. YOU KNOW,  TRAVEL ADVISORIES ARE GOOD FOREIGN POLICY FOR A WHILE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALWAYS I THINK A RAY OF SUNSHINE AND OPTIMISTIC VOICE IN A WORLD OF DARKNESS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK, THANK YOU, BOSS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I CAN'T WAIT. "FAREED ZAKARIA GPS." IT AIRS SUNDAYS AT 10:00 A.M. AND 1:00 P.M. ON JON STEWART'S CNN. FAREED ZAKARIA.
