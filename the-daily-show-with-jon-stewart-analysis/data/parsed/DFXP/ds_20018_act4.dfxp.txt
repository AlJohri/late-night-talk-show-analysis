Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW! THE REPUBLICANS NEEDED, THEY NEEDED SIX SEATS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THEY NOW HAVE THE SIX SEATS. NORTH CAROLINA, BIT OF AN UPSET, JUST TURNED, THAT'S WITHOUT ALASKA, IOWA, AND SOME OTHER ONES THAT MAY COME TO FOLLOW. BUT NOW, AS ALWAYS, LET'S CHECK IN WITH OUR GOOD FRIEND STEPHEN COLBERT AT "THE COLBERT REPORT." STEPHEN, WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR US TONIGHT?
Stephen: WELL, JON, I'M COVERING THE BIGGEST NEWS IN SPORTS. LEBRON MAKES HIS CAVALIERS DEBUT: PART 2! AND I INVESTIGATE THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF BASEBALL FROM T.V. WAS IT MURDER?
Jon: STEPHEN, AREN'T YOU COVERING THE MIDTERMS?
Stephen: WHY JON, DIDN'T YOU ALREADY JUST COVER THEM?
Jon: I DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING.
Stephen: REALLY? WHAT'S LEFT?
Jon: WELL, ALASKA HASN'T COME IN YET?
Stephen: OK, ALRIGHT.
Jon: MARK BEGICH.
Stephen: OK, ALRIGHT. I GOT IT. WHAT ELSE? GO ON? YEAH?
Jon: LOUISIANA. MARY LANDRIEU FIGHTING OFF A FIELD OF SEVEN CHALLENGERS?
Stephen: LOUISIANA. THAT'S A STATE, SHAPED LIKE A BOOT, RIGHT?
Jon: SURE.
Stephen: ANY BIG HOUSE RACES YOU CAN KEEP TALKING ABOUT FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR?
Jon: STEPHEN, I'M NOT GOING TO DO YOUR SHOW FOR YOU.
Stephen: IT'S SO MUCH FUN, JON! I'M PAINTING A FENCE TONIGHT!
Jon: I'M NOT PAINTING A FENCE AGAIN!
Stephen: DAMN YOU, STEWART!
Jon: DAMN YOU, COLBERT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW! JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00 FULL ELECTION RESULTS. AND NOW IF YOU WOULD, I WOULD URGE YOU TO STAY TUNED FOR OUR GOOD FRIEND, AND A VERY TALENTED MAN, A VERY LOVELY PERSON, MR. STEPHEN COLBERT! I'M SORRY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
