(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WELL, AS WE'VE JUST SEEN IT  SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING THE  GOVERNMENT DOES TURNS OUT, AS THE ITALIAN'S MIGHT SAY NO GOOD. GET OFF THE BRIDGE, PEOPLE,  SOMETIMES IT CAN WORK THE WAY  IT'S SUPPOSED TO WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR HOPEFULLY RECURRING  SEGMENT "THE DAILY SHOW'S  BIANNUAL COMPETENCY ROUNDUP." IT ONLY HAS ONE STORY IN IT, BUT  STILL. (LAUGHTER)  REMEMBER THIS? THE "TIME" MAGAZINE COVER STORY  FROM BACK IN MARCH IN WHICH  JOURNALIST STEVEN BRILL EXPLAINED WHY SOME PROCEDURES  COST EXPONENTIALLY MORE AT  CERTAIN HOSPITALS COMPARED TO THE COST FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. I'LL LET THE "TIME" MAGAZINE  EDITOR GIVE THE BULLET POINT.
HOSPITALS, WHEN THEY DECIDE  WHAT TO CHARGE OUTSIDE OF THE  MEDICARE STRUCTURE, RELY ON A DOUBLE SECRET PRICING MENU  CALLED THE CHARGE MASTER AND  BASICALLY THE PRICES THEY CHARGE ARE JUST WHIMSICAL.
Jon: WHIMSICAL! OOH! (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S THE WORD THAT POPS INTO  THE MIND OF A FAMILY BANKRUPTED  BY HOSPITAL BILLS. IT'S LIKE OZ. (LAUGHTER)  UNTIL BRILL'S INVESTIGATION, THE  SO-CALLED CHARGE MASTER WAS  CLOAKED IN MYSTERY. NOW WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW  HOSPITALS SET THEIR PRICES. (LAUGHTER)  THEY GATHER ON THE FIRST FULL  MOON OF THE YEAR TO BURY THE  CARCASS OF A SUCKLING PIG. (LAUGHTER)  PREFERABLY AT A CROSS ROADS AND  THEN, AFTER A FORTNIGHT, THEY  EXHUME THE BONES WHICH ARE THEN CAST INTO A CLEROMANTIC RITUAL  AND READ BY THE TOWN ELDERS. THEN AND ONLY THEN DO THEY  IGNORE THAT NUMBER AND CHARGE  WHATEVER SEEMS MOST PLAUSIBLE. (LAUGHTER)  THESE REVELATIONS CAUSED A BIT  OF A STIR IN THE MEDICAL  COMMUNITY, WHICH MAKES SENSE CONSIDERING THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO  READ "TIME" MAGAZINE, ANYMORE,  ARE MEDICAL PATIENTS. (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, HERE IS WHERE THE MIRACLE  OF COMPETENCE HAPPENS. THANKS TO THE "TIME" PIECE, THE  GOVERNMENT TOOK STEPS TO FIX THE  PROBLEM.
AN EYE-OPENING EVEN SHOCKING  FIRST OF ITS KIND GOVERNMENT  REPORT IS OUT ON THE COST OF HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND  HUMAN SERVICES BASICALLY TOOK A  LOOK AT 3,000 HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY EXAMINED THE  TOP 100 PROCEDURES, TREATING A  HEART ATTACK WITH NO COMPLICATIONS AT A HOSPITAL IN  DANVILLE, ARKANSAS, THAT WILL  COST YOU. $3,000. IN MODESTO, CALIFORNIA, IT WILL  ACTUALLY COST YOU $92,000.
Jon: NO OOH, NO AH, TO BE  FAIR, THE $90,000 EXTRA IS  BECAUSE THEY REPLACE YOUR HEART WITH THE HEART OF THE OCEAN FROM  "TITANIC."  (LAUGHTER)  IT'S WORTH IT FOR THE  RELIABILITY. (LAUGHTER)  ♪ THE HEART WILL GO ON ♪  (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT, OKAY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IN TERMS OF BEHAVIOR  MODIFICATION, THAT IS THE WRONG  RESPONSE TO MY SINGING. (LAUGHTER)  REALLY? THEY LIKE IT! ALL RIGHT, THOSE FIGURES WERE IN  TOTALLY DIFFERENT STATES,  ARKANSAS AND CALIFORNIA. CHARGE MASTER'S GOT TO BE MORE  CONSISTENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT HOSPITALS IN THE SAME  STATE.
IN NEW JERSEY, IF YOU'RE  GETTING A PACEMAKER YOU CAN PAY. $0,000 FOR IT OR YOU CAN PAY  $101,000.
Jon: SO, LISTEN, YOU WANT  THE PACE MAKER THAT KEEPS YOUR  HEART WORKING OR YOU WANT TO $70,000 ONE? WHAT DO YOU WANT? (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS  ESSENTIALLY A RARE TOTAL ECLIPSE  OF CONFIDENCE. A JOURNALIST FLAG ADD SERIOUS  PROBLEM AND THE GOVERNMENT MADE  IT EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO NAVIGATE THE PROBLEM. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW IS GET  HURT NEAR CHEAPER HOSPITALS. (LAUGHTER)  AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES ALL THAT  I.R.S. AND BENGHAZI AND V.A. STUFF SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE  CAN DO BETTER. AND IF THIS TYPE OF THING  HAPPENED MORE THAN THAT TYPE OF  THING WE WOULD BE DOING BETTER. SO BIG UPS TO H.H.S. AND TO  "TIME", OUR NEW HOME FOR SERIOUS  JOURNALISM. WHAT'S THE NEXT COVER STORY.
THE "ME, ME, ME GENERATION."  (LAUGHTER)  REALLY, SO PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN INTO DIFFERENT GENERATIONS ARE  DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER? THAT REMINDS ME OF THE COVER YOU  HAD IN 1990 AND THAT SAID GEN-X  WAS SELFISH AND I'M GUESSING YOU TOOK THAT BACK BECAUSE THOSE  PEOPLE ENDED UP RUNNING "TIME"  MAGAZINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
