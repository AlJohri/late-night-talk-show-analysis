JANUARY 14, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS THE GREAT  ONE, ROGER WATERS OF PINK FLOYD  WILL BE GOING UP HERE. OBVIOUSLY THE INTERVIEW WILL BE  ACCOMPANIED BY A LASER SHOW. LET ME JUST GET RIGHT TO IT. IF YOU ARE HERE AND YOU DID  RECENTLY GET MARRIED (LAUGHING),  YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR SISTER  ALONG? I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO IT NOW. BEFORE WE BEGIN, ONE QUICK BIT  OF HOUSEKEEPING. LAST THURSDAY WE TOOK A BIT OF A  IS A TEARIAL LOOK AT AN IDEA  THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD SOLVE SOME OF OUR FISCAL ISSUES BY  EXPLOITING A LEGAL LOOPHOLE AND  MINTING A TRILLION DOLLAR COIN. I'M NOT AN ECONOMIST BUT IF  WE'RE JUST GOING TO MAKE [BLEEP] UP, I SAID GO HOME. HOW ABOUT A $20 TRILLION COIN OR  FORGET ABOUT IT. I WAS DIGGING THROUGH THE WHITE  HOUSE COUCH CUSHIONS AND  EISENHOWER MUST HAVE LEFT THIS $100 QUILLION BILL. I KNOW IT'S REAL BECAUSE IT HAS  OUR NATION'S PREVIOUS SEAL, A  UNICORN FERCHING ASON TAWR. SAUCY. WE DID RECEIVE A BIT OF PUSHBACK  ON THAT FROM THE ONLY CREATURE  PERHAPS MORE NOBLE THAN A FRESHLY FELCHED UNICORN. AND THE POINT IS THIS. WE HEARD FROM THE RARE  GRAY-BEARDED URBAN LAUREATE  ECONOMIST PAUL KRUGMAN. ANYWAY, HE WROTE ON HIS BLOG  THERE HE CALLED ME LAZY. SAID THERE WAS A LACK OF  PROFESSIONALISM ON THE PART OF  OF ME AND MY STAFF. FOR FINDING PRIVILEGE OLITY IN  THE IDEA OF A TEMPORARY TRILLION  DOLLAR COIN. FIRST OF ALL, LAZY? I'M BANGING IT OUT 22 MINUTES A  DAY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   DON'T TELL ME I DON'T WORK HARD. AND SECOND OF ALL, DON'T BLAME  MY IGNORANCE ON MY STAFF. IT'S ALL ME. YOU KNOW, THEY GOT ENOUGH TO DO  WHAT WITH CARRYING ME FROM  CUBICLE TO CUBICLE. AS WE LEARNED EARLIER, I'M LAZY. SO WHAT IS YOUR BEEF? AND IF YOU COULD PUT IT IN WEB  CAST FORM, SATURATE THE COLOR  AND TILT THAT [BLEEP]
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ISSUES  ARE. THE REASON WE'VE GOTTEN TO THIS  PLACE HE DID IT AS A SORT OF YUK  YUK YUK STUPID. WHEN HE JUST TURNS IT INTO DUMB,  OH, I DON'T KNOW NOTHING BUT  THOSE PEOPLE LOOK STUPID TO ME, HE'S ACTUALLY, HE'S RUINING HIS  OWN BRAND.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, I'M PRETTY  SURE THAT IS MY BRAND. AND SECOND OF ALL,... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ... WHAT? IF ANYBODY IS RUINING THEIR  BRAND, WITH A TRILLION DOLLAR  COIN IDEA, I DON'T THINK IT'S THE NONECONOMIST. LOOK. AS WE MOST BITS WE DO, WHETHER  OF THE FULLY FLESHED-OUT OR MORE  DRIVE-BY VARIETY, THERE ARE ALWAYS VARIOUS COUNTERARGUMENTS  AND NUANCES OF LANGUAGE AND  THOUGHT WHICH CAN BE CITED AS EVIDENCE OF THIS SHOW'S INHERENT  UNFAIRNESS OR IGNORANCE. TYPICALLY A BLUNTNESS PEOPLE  FORGIVE WHEN IN AGREEMENT WITH  OUR POINT OF VIEW. SO I STANDBY OUR RESEARCH ON  THIS TOPIC. WITH DUE DILIGENCE AND MY  IGNORANCE INCLUSION THAT A  TRILLION DOLLAR COIN IS A STUPID [BLEEP] IDEA. AND I'M A FAN OF PAUL KRUGMAN. ALL RIGHT. OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY  ISSUE FACING OBAMA.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PICKS FOR  HIS NEW CABINET MEMBERS RAISING  SOME QUESTIONS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FOUR  NEWEST CHOICES. ONE THING YOU MIGHT NOTICE ABOUT  ALL OF THEM, ANYBODY WANT TO  JUMP IN. WHAT DO YOU THINK
Jon: THAT'S KISS WITHOUT THE  MAKE-UP. I KNOW THESE GUYS. YES! PLAY "LICK IT UP."
WHERE ARE THE WOMEN, FOR  EXAMPLE? WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE OF COLOR? THE FOURTH WHITE MALE MR. OBAMA  HAS CHOSEN IN THE LAST MONTH
WHERE ARE THE WOMEN? WHERE ARE THE MINORS
Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME THE  PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES COULDN'T HAVE FOUND ONE WOMAN OR MINORITY TO  FILL AN IMPORTANT JOB? WHAT ABOUT INSTEAD OF JOHN KERRY  SUSAN RICE FOR SECRETARY OF  STATE. LADY AND MINORITY. TRIPLE WORD SCORE
I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY  POWER TO BLOCK HER. SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. McCAIN. DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT  BARACK OBAMA HIMSELF IS SOMEWHAT  DIVERSE IS BEING DISCRIMINATORY IN HIS HIRING PRACTICES
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" RAN THIS  PHOTO THE OTHER DAY SHOWING THE  PRESIDENT WITH A GROUP OF ALL WHITE MEN ADVISING HIM IN THE  OVAL OFFICE.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL COMPUTER  ENHANCED. THERE'S A BLACK GUY RIGHT THERE. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT BALANCES  EVERYTHING OUT BUT THAT IS A  BLACK GUY. AND THERE IS ANOTHER BLACK GUY  WHO APPEARS TO BE RUNNING THE  MEETING. STILL, FAIR POINT. THERE AREN'T ANY WOMEN IN THE  PHOTO.
THIS PHOTO SHOWS THE  PRESIDENT SURROUNDED BY ALL MALE  ADVISORS ALTHOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS TOP AIDE VALERIE  JARRETT IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE  MEN.
Jon: THAT'S JUST VALERIE  JARRETT'S STYLE. HERE SHE IS AT THE '08  INAUGURATION. HERE SHE IS AT TIANAMEN SQUARE. HERE SHE IS WITH BUZZ ALDRIN ON  THE MOON. SHE'S LIKE A LIVING WHERE'S  WALDO. HERE SHE IS BEHIND WALDO. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT'S  EXCUSE FOR THIS. ACTUALLY, I CAN HEAR THE  PRESIDENT'S EXCUSE FOR THIS
I'M VERY PROUD THAT IN THE  FIRST FOUR YEARS THAT WE HAD AS  DIVERSE IF NOT MORE DIVERSE A WHITE HOUSE AND A CABINET THAN  ANY IN HISTORY. WHAT? I'VE MADE FOUR APPOINTMENTS SO  FAR. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT EVERYBODY  KIND OF WAIT UNTIL THEY'VE SEEN  ALL MY APPOINTMENTS, WHO IS IN THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF AND WHO IS  IN MY CABINET BEFORE THEY RUSH  TO JUDGMENT.
Jon: FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY  SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT  JESSICA WILLIAMS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   JESSICA, ALL LAST YEAR THE  CONCERN ABOUT OBAMA IN HIS SECOND TERM WAS GOING TO BE THAT  HE'S GOING TO GO FULL ON LIKE  SOCIALIST BLACK PANTHER ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT. NOW HE APPEARS TO HAVE GONE MORE  SEASON ONE OF MAD MEN. WHAT'S HAPPENING?
JOHN, PEOPLE FORGET,  PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ALSO HALF  WHITE. EVERYBODY WAS WAS SO FOCUSED ON  BLACK OBAMA AND ALL THE BLACK  STUFF HE DID IN HIS FIRST TERM. OBAMA CARE, FOOD STAMP. THEY COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT  WHITE OBAMA WHO HAS BEEN IN  THERE BIDING HIS TIME. JUST WAITING TO TAKE THIS  COUNTRY BACK AND RESTORE THE  TRADITIONAL AMERICA THIS BLACK OBAMA HAS WORKED SO HARD TO  DESTROY.
Jon: WOW. EXACTLY  Jon: I GOT SO SAY, WHITE  OBAMA HAS BEEN PLAYING A LONG  GAME
JON, YOU KNOW, WHITE OBAMA  HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE MAKING THE  OCCASIONAL APPEARANCE. ON VACATION. ON WEEKENDS. I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  CATCH A BROTHER WEARING THOSE  JEANS AND A BIKE HELMET ON A TEN SPEED WITH CROSS TRAINERS ON.
Jon: THAT WHITE OBAMA IS  PRETTY WHITE.
THE WHITEST. Jon: SO IF WHITE OBAMA IS 50%  AND BLACK OBAMA IS 50%...
WELL HE'S NOT QUITE LIKE  THAT, OKAY. ACCORDING TO THE WHITE OBAMA,  BLACK OBAMA IS ONLY 47% OF TOTAL  OBAMA.
Jon: WHAT? YEAH. HE SAYS THAT 47% FEELS IT'S  ENTITLED TO SOMETHING FROM THE  GOVERNMENT.
Jon: WHAT'S THE OTHER 3%? WHITE OBAMA IS PRETTY SURE  IT'S LATINO.
Jon: WHAT? HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
WHITE OBAMA DOESN'T KNOW. IF WE DON'T PUT A STOP TO IT,  THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ALMOST ALL  LATINO BY 2020.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. SO WHITE OBAMA IS IN CHARGE NOW?
YEP. HE'S GOING TO RETURN THIS  COUNTRY TO THE GREATNESS OF THE  FOUNDERS. WITH A CABINET OF WHITE GUYS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT. I KNOW. I HEAR YOU.
GET IT OUT. Jon: KNOCK IT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY, AT
