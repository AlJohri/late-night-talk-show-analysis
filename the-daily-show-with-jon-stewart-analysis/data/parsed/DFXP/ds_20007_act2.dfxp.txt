Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS --  THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, AND I  KNOW YOU'RE ALL REALLY  EXCITED -- ARE ONLY A MONTH  AWAY. AND THEIR OUTCOME WILL BE IN THE HANDS  OF ONE CONSTITUENCY.
WOMEN ARE GONNA DECIDE THE  ELECTION.
THE IMPORTANCE OF WINNING OVER WOMEN.
WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES WHO DECIDE WHO CONTROLS THE SENATE. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: SEEMED AWFULLY, SEEMED AWFULLY HIGH PITCHED. WOMEN ARE THE TOP INTEREST GROUP  IN 2014, AND IN LAST PLACE  ONCE AGAIN -- MERMAN LAWYERS. OH, I'M SO SORRY. NOW USUALLY WOMEN ARE A SURE THING FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT THIS YEAR THE GOP IS LAUNCHING A BIG REBRANDING EFFORT TO CHANGE THAT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO  LEVERAGE THE WOMEN'S VOTE.
THIS BIG REBRANDING EFFORT.
THE NATIONAL COLLEGE REPUBLICANS, THEY RAN AN AD --
WITH THE IDEA OF ATTRACTING YOUNGER WOMEN INTO VOTING REPUBLICAN.
THE BARRAGE OF TV ADVERTISEMENTS SPONSORED BY A WELL FUNDED CONSERVATIVE GROUP FEATURING WOMEN.
A NEARLY $1 MILLION  CAMPAIGN AD TO DRAW YOUNG  FEMALE VOTERS TO THE GOP.
I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION TO  SPEND JUST FIVE MINUTES IN THE  VOTERS BOOTH WITH YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC. FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR WOMENS ISSUES CORRESPONDENT, KRISTEN SCHAAL. KRISTEN.
HELLO! I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD. HELLO.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.
I AM TOO -- WELL, I'M ALWAYS -- [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: THIS  REPUBLICAN AD CAMPAIGN  OUTREACH TO WOMEN GOING?
IT'S SO GREAT, JON. REPUBLICANS HAVE FINALLY  FIGURED OUT WHAT'S MOST  IMPORTANT TO WOMEN. MEN FOLK. WOMEN DON'T SEE CANDIDATES AS POTENTIAL LEADERS. WE SEE THEM AS POSSIBLE SOUL MATES.  REPUBLICANS ARE FINALLY RUNNING ADS TO REFLECT THAT.
WELCOME TO THE CANDIDATE. BACHELORETTE ASHLEY NOW MUST MAKE HER FINAL DECISION. MARK'S ALWAYS INVADING MY SPACE, SPYING ON MY MESSAGES, READING MY EMAILS.
WE'LL ASHLEY SEND MARK, THE DEMOCRATS PACKING? WILL SHE FINALLY CHOOSE RICK, THE REPUBLICAN WHO WILL WORK FOR HER FUTURE.
OH MY GOD, RICK'S SO DREAMY. I HOPE SHE DOESN'T CHOOSE MARK. HE'S A MESS.
Jon: SO FAR THE GOP GOES, WOMEN THINK ELECTIONS ARE JUST ABOUT GETTING INTO  RELATIONSHIPS?
NO, NO. THAT'S INSULTING AND REDUCTIVE. WOMEN DON'T JUST THINK ABOUT  GETTING INTO RELATIONSHIPS, WE  ALSO THINK ABOUT GETTING OUT  OF THEM. LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN WITH  OBAMA.
IN 2008 I FELL IN LOVE. HIS ONLINE PROFILE MADE HIM SEEM SO PERFECT. BUT BY 2012, OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS [ LAUGHTER ]
LET IT OUT, GIRL. LET IT OUT. WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.
HE'S IN MY EMAILS AND TEXT MESSAGES, SPYING ON ME BUT IGNORING REAL THREATS. HE THINKS THE THING I CARE  ABOUT IS FREE BIRTH CONTROL,  BUT HE WON'T EVEN LET ME KEEP MY OWN  DOCTOR.
SHE'S RIGHT. WE GAVE OBAMA OUR HEART AND ALL WE GOT IN RETURN WAS THIS FREE BIRTH CONTROL? [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: KRISTEN, ISN'T THAT, ISN'T THAT REALLY TOO MANY?
NOT FOR DEMOCRATS. [APPLAUSE] SO RECKLESS! [APPLAUSE ]
Jon: YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE  CAMPAIGN -- [ LAUGHTER ] I'M REALLY HOPING THOSE FELL OFF YOUR LAP.
INSTEAD OF WHAT?
Jon: I JUST SAW SOMETHING  UNDER THE TABLE MOVE, AND THEN  I HEARD THEM HIT THE FLOOR. I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. THIS WHOLE ANGLE THAT THE REPUBLICANS CAME UP WITH, IT FEELS LIKE, YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY WANTED MORE GIRLS TO PLAY  PACMAN SO THEN THEY JUST SLAPPED LIP STICK AND A BOW ON PACMAN AND THEN CALLED IT MS. PACMAN?
YEAH. JON, MS. PACMAN IS A FEMINIST  HERO. SHE DOESN'T SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR PATRIARCHAL IDEA OF WHAT A WOMAN'S BODY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. SHE ATE WHATEVER SHE WANTED. PINEAPPLES, PRETZELS, GHOSTS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW HER  COURAGE.
I DON'T FORGIVE YOU, JON. FACE IT, REPUBLICANS FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW WOMEN'S BRAINS WORK. SCIENCE SHOWS THAT THIS PART RIGHT HERE IS DEVOTED TO THINKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE SMALL PART HERE IS BITCHINESS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WERE THOSE SCIENTISTS  MEN, BY ANY CHANCE?
YEAH. THEY WERE SCIENTISTS. WOMEN SCIENTISTS? WHOO HOO. PEW PEW! THEY'VE EVEN DESIGNED AN AD FOR  WHEN YOU MEET THE PERFECT  CANDIDATE, AND YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY HE'S THE ONE, AND THEN IT'S TIME FOR EVERY LITTLE GIRL'S WET DREAM, FINDING A WEDDING DRESS.
THE TOM CORBETT IS PERFECT.
I LIKE THE TOM WOLF. IT'S OVERPRICED AND A  LITTLE OUTDATED, BUT I KNOW  BEST. AND DON'T FORGET THE TOM WOLF COMES WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS.  THERE'S INCREASED TAXES.
MOM, THIS IS MY DECISION. I SEE A BETTER FUTURE WITH TOM  CORBETT.
IT ALL WORKED OUT IN THE END BECAUSE BRITTNEY SAID YES TO TOM CORBETT.
OH, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU BRITNEY. I MEAN, I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS BECAUSE THAT DRESS WOULD HAVE LOOKED SO MUCH BETTER ON ME, BUT YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL. CONGRATULATIONS.
Jon: KRISTEN, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. AND WHY DON'T MEN GET THESE KINDS  OF ADS?
OH DON'T WORRY, REPUBLICANS ALSO HAVE ADS TARGETING MEN IN THE EXACT SAME INSULTING WAY.
YOU KNOW THE SAYING, (BLEEP) HER RIGHT IN THE (BLEEP) I'M THE GUY WHO CAME UP WITH THAT. AND I VOTE REPUBLICAN. YOU WANT TO GET YOU (BLEEP) WET? THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GET KICK MARY LEONARD TO THE CURB. A CENTRIST DEMOCRAT? WHAT IS THAT EVEN? IT'S SO CONFUSING, JUST LIKE CHICKS RIGHT? VOTE REPUBLICAN, IF YOU WANT TO  ROCK! VOTE REPUBLICAN, IF YOU'VE GOT THE NADS. [ LAUGHTER ]
WHO WAS THAT, WHO WAS THAT GUY? BECAUSE I WANT TO VOTE FOR THAT GUY.
I WANNA (BLEEP) THAT GUY RIGHT IN THE (BLEEP).
Jon: KRISTEN SCHALL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
