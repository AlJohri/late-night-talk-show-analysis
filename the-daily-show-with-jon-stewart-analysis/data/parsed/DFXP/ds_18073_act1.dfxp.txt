Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BAM! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I AM PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT  THIS, THE HEAD COACH OF THE NEW  YORK FOOTBALL GIANTS, TOM COUGHLIN IS JOINING US LATER. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE IS A GOOD AND DECENT MAN WHO  SHOULD IN NO WAY LOWER HIMSELF  TO APPEAR ON A PROGRAM LIKE THIS BUT WE'RE EXCITED HE HAS. FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW YESTERDAY  SENATOR RAND PAUL EMBARKED ON A  FILIBUSTER TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S  SEEMINGLY UNCHECKED POWER TO USE  DRONES ON AMERICAN SOIL. THE LIBERTARIAN SENATOR SPOKE  FOR 12 HOURS FOR THEIFIED ONLY  BY THE OCCASIONAL NOUGAT FILLED GOVERNMENT HANDOUT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND BRIEF RESPIT THANKS TO  LIKE-MINDED SENATORS WHO SHARE  HIS COMMITMENT TO CHECKING EXECUTIVE POWER. WAIT A MINUTE, IS THAT MITCH  McCONNELL?
FIRST LET ME THANK HIM FOR  HIS COURAGE AND CONVICTION, THE  ADMINISTRATION SHOULD ANSWER A QUESTION DOES THE ADMINISTRATION  TAKE THE VIEW THAT A DRONE  STROKE AGAINST A U.S. ZEN ON U.S. SOIL WOULD BE AN  APPROPRIATE USE OF THAT WEAPON.
Jon: SIMMER DOWN TURTLE  MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T THINK DRONE STRIKES -- [LAUGHTER] ER? [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT  THE OTHER SENATORS. THE OTHER SENATORS ARE  REETIONENT ADDITIONS TO THE  SENATE SO I DON'T MIND THEM  JUMPING INTO PAUL'S FILIBUSTER BUT YOU DON'T GET TO JUMP IN ON  THE CONCERN THAT THE EXECUTIVE  BRANCH MIGHT BE TRAMPLING THE CRIEWTION TRAIN. AS I REMEMBER THE HABEAS CORPUS  SEE IF YOU CAN GET THE PRESIDENT  TO SIGN OFF ON WIRETAPPING I BELIEVE YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT  WAS -- YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] BACK TO SENATOR PAUL, IT WAS A  THOROUGHLY ENTERTAINING DISPLAY  OF MORAL FORTITUDE WHICH SADLY COME TO AN END THAT ALL  FILIBUSTERS MUST.
I WOULD GO FOR ANOTHER 12  HOURS TO BROKE STORM'S RECORD  BUT THERE ARE LIMITS TO FILIBUSTERING AND I'M GOING HAVE  TO TAKE CARE OF ONE OF THOSE IN  A FEW MINUTES HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS  GUY CAN'T GO 12 HOURS WITHOUT  MASTURBATING. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE -- WHAT IS  THAT? WHAT? OH, HE'S TALKING ABOUT  URINATION. ME TOO. ON TO THE MAIN STORY POPE  BENEDICT 16th BAKE AN EXPOPE  AFTER RELUCTANTLY GIVING UP CUSTODY OF HIS BABY -- NOT MY  BABY. THUS BEGINNING THE RACE TO  BECOME THE NEXT PONTIFF.
ANY MALE CATHOLIC CAN BE  ELECTED POPE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ANY MALE CATHOLIC,  HUH? I KNOW A MALE CATHOLIC WHO HAS  AN INSIDE TRACK ON  INFALLIBILITY, THE QUESTION IS WOULD O'REILLY ACCEPT THE  DEMOTION? [LAUGHTER] WHO ARE WE KIDDING? THEY ARE GOING TO PICK ONE OF  THE CARDINALS WHO WHO DO YOU  HAVE?
CARDINAL SCOLA OF MILAN AN  ITALIAN FRONT RUNNER AND  CARDINAL TAGLY OF THE  PHILIPPINES. AT 55 HE IS ONE OF YOUNGEST ON  THE LIST. HE LOOKED A BIT LIKE A BOY SCOUT  AS HE HELPED AN ELDERLY CARDINAL  GO IN.
Jon:.
Jon: WHAT COULD BE MORE  WHOLESOME THAN THAT? ANY OTHER CANDIDATE?
CARDINAL FROM ARGENTINA  SAYING THE CHURCH NEEDS NEEDS TO DO A  BETTER JOB REACHING OUT TO  WOMEN.
Jon: WANT TO REACH OUT TO  WOMEN? MAYBE CONSIDER ONE OF THEM FOR  POPE? OH, TOO MUCH? HOW ABOUT FOR CARDINAL? NO BISHOP? [LAUGHTER] PRIEST? [LAUGHTER] GOOD LUCK WITH THAT OUTREACH.

LEONARDO SAID HE IS  INFALLIBLE BUT LAST WEEK HE  PICKED BRADLEY COOPER IN THE OSCAR POOL. BRADLEY COOPER, LEONARDO WRONG  ABOUT BRADLEY COOPER WRONG FOR  THE VATICAN. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

SORRY, YOU WANT SUBSTANCE,  BAGEL WITH YOUR SCHMERAR?
MARK CLAIMS HE SUPPORTS THE  FIRST COUNCIL, CAN HE PREVIOUS  HE IS FREE OF HEARSEY? BEWARE OF HIM? HE'S A THREAT TO THE  MONOPHOCITE.

Jon: AASIF MANDVI,  EVERYBODY. WHO GETS TO VOTE FOR THE NEW  POPE AND WHERE DO THEY DO IT? IT'S BEEN SET IN STONE FOR  CENTURIES BUT THE PROCESS IS  STILL A MYSTERY.
THE CARDINALS OF CHURCH WILL  MEET BEHIND THE LOCKED DOORS OF  SISTINE CHAP TOLL ELECT A POPE. IN THAT PROCESS KNOWN AS A  CONCLAVE.
