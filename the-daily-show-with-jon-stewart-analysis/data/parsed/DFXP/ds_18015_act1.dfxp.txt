NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, WE'VE GOT SO MUCH TO GET THROUGH TONIGHT, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. WE GOT SO MUCH TO GET THROUGH TONIGHT, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. WE TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION. DONALD TRUMP TODAY AT NOON MADE THAT HUGE, CAMPAIGN-SHAKING ANNOUNCEMENT HE HAD BEEN PROMISING. HE OFFERED THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A CHARITY GIFT OF $5 MILLION IF THE PRESIDENT WOULD RELEASE HIS COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF TRUMP MAKING IT... [LAUGHTER] YEAH, OH, WAIT A SECOND. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. THAT WASN'T DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO PUBLICLY EXTORT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT WAS A GORILLA EATING ITS OWN [BLEEPED]. MY APOLOGIES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT... THAT WAS WEIRD. ANYWAY, SARAH PALIN CHIMED IN, ACCUSED THE PRESIDENT OF "SHUCKING AND JIVING." YEAH, HER WORDS, "SHUCKING AND JIVING" ABOUT LIBYA. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HER STATEMENT. OH, WAIT. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. THAT'S... HUH. HUH. I APOLOGIZE. THAT WAS A HIPPO SPRAYING ITS OWN [BLEEPED] THROUGH ITS TAIL. AGAIN, I... I DON'T KNOW HOW I ENDED UP CONFUSING THESE IMAGES. LOOK, LET'S FACE FACTS, WE'RE TIRED AS HELL OF COVERING ALL OF THESE IMPORTANT ELECTORAL DEVELOPMENTS ANYWAY. SO TONIGHT WE THOUGHT WE'D FOCUS ON A DIFFERENT, PERHAPS MORE INTERESTING TOPIC. TO THAT END, WE WILL HAVE ON AS OUR GUEST AUTHOR AND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT DAKOTA MEYER, AND WE'LL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WHAT WE THINK... TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF WHAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT VETERANS ISSUES, BECAUSE AS DIVIDED AS AMERICA, IS, THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE THINGS WE AGREE ON. ONE, POPCORN IS CORN, SO FOR DIETARY PURPOSE, IT DOES COUNT AS A VEGETABLE. AND NUMBER TWO...
THE PUBLIC'S VOICE IS CLEAR. 85% OF AMERICANS POLLED BY CNN IN JANUARY SAID PREVENTING CUTS IN VETERANS' BENEFITS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN REDUCING THE DEFICIT.
Jon: WAIT, WHO ARE THE [BLEEPED], THE 14% THAT SAY REDUCING THE DEFICIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR OBLIGATION TO OUR VETERANS? WHO ARE THOSE [BLEEPED]? ROLL TAPE.
SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCKED A BILL YESTERDAY THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIFE YEARS TO HELP OVER 20,000 VETERANS FIND WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITY. REPUBLICANS ARGUED THE BILL WAS UNPAID FOR.
Jon: SHAME WE'RE OUT OF ANIMAL [BLEEPED] FOOTAGE. LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED HERE. 40 REPUBLICAN SENATORS... [LAUGHTER] YOU LIKE THAT? 40 REPUBLICAN SENATORS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS ON A BILL TO HELP REINTEGRATE VETERANS INTO THE DOMESTIC WORKFORCE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAD ALREADY GLADLY SPENT ON WARS THAT MADE THEM VETERANS IN THE FIRST PLACE. BESIDES, WHY DO VETERANS NEED EXTRA HELP FINDING WORK? DON'T THEY COME BACK WITH ALL SORTS OF VALUABLE SKILLS?
AS VETERANS RETURN HOME TODAY WITH MILITARY TRAINING THEY RECEIVED, THAT TRAINING IS NOT RECOGNIZED BY CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES AND STATES AND THEREFORE THEY'RE FORCED TO GO THROUGH REDUNDANT TRAINING TO DO THE JOB THEY WERE DOING IN THE MILITARY. IF SOMEBODY CAN DO A JOB WHILE SERVING IN A WAR ZONE, THEY CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT SAME JOB AT HOME IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.
Jon: CAN THEY? SURE YOU CAN DRIVE A VEHICLE WHILE BEING SHOT AT, BUT CAN YOU DO IT WHILE NOT BEING SHOT AT? [LAUGHTER] LUCKILY, ALL IS MOTT LOST. A PIECE OF THE LARGER FILIBUSTERED BILL, WHICH WAS THE VETERANS JOB CORPS ACT OF 2012, DOES STILL REMAIN IN PLAY. THIS PIECE IS CALLED THE "HIRE AT HOME" ACT. IT'S PASSED THE HOUSE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND IS SITTING IN SENATE COMMITTEE WAITING FOR OLD, SLOW PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT. HOW DO WE FIX THIS MASSIVE VETERAN EMPLOYMENT OVERSIGHT? THE "HIRE AT HOME ACT," A TWO-PAGE BILL THAT ASKS, NAY DEMANDS, THAT STATES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A VETERAN'S TRAINING. YES, FROM NOW ON WITH GOD AS MY WITNESS, IF YOUR STATE WANTS FEDERAL JOB TRAINING MONEY, WHEN YOU INTERVIEW VETERANS, THEIR TRAINING MUST NOT, SHALL NOT, WILL NOT GO UNCONSIDERED. [LAUGHTER] FOR A MOMENT. TWO PROBLEMS. ONE, A BILL THAT SEEKS TO CORRECT THE VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM TO CIVILIAN SKILL AND SHORT EASY SAYINGS IS SUBSTANTIALLY SHORTER THAN THE iTUNES CONTRACT YOU HAVE TO SIGN TO DOWNLOAD A SEASON OF "BAND OF BROTHERS." NUMBER TWO, THE PROBLEM IS ONLY PARTIALLY ON THE STATE. A MAJOR PIECE WHY SKILLS DON'T TRANSFERRES BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE IS THE MILITARY CERTIFICATION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN THE CIVILIAN CERTIFICATION PROCESS. APPARENTLY THE TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT YET EXIST TO CONVERT THAT INFORMATION. OR PERHAPS THE TECHNOLOGY IS SO ADVANCED THAT IT EXISTS BUT HUMAN EYES CANNOT SEE IT. STEALTH PAPER! [LAUGHTER] WELL PLAYED, PENTAGON, WELL PLAYED. ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR TO THE PENTAGON AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THIS IS ONLY OUR 240th YEAR OF FIGHTING WARS. SO NEW ISSUES ARE ALWAYS GOING TO ARISE, LIKE WHAT TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT FOR YOU AFTERWARDS. LOOK, ALL ARMIES FACE THIS, EXCEPT ODDLY ENOUGH THE KISS ARMY, WERE FOR JUST $110, KISS ARMY MEMBERS RECEIVE FULL CERTIFICATION, ATTESTING THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF NOT ONLY KNOCK TERNAL ROCKING, BUT EVERYDAY PARTYING, SKILLS RECOGNIZED BY ALL 50 STATES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LOOK, HERE'S THE OTHER THING. MAYBE IT'S TIME WE POINT THE FINGER AT VETERANS THEMSELVES. WHAT GAVE THESE VETERANS THE IDEA THAT THEIR MILITARY SKILLS WOULD BE TRANSFERABLE TO THE REAL WORLD IN THE FIRST PLACE?
THE STRENGTH TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE CAN BE FOUND IN THE ARMY, WITH LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND TRAINING IN OVER 150 CAREERS, 150 CAREERS IN THE STRENGTHS AMERICA'S TOP EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING FOR.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] [BLEEPED] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
