(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A FULL PANEL DISCUSSION TO ILLUMINATE AND ANALYZE.
I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH LAST NIGHT WAS ON POINT.
IT WAS A CAMPAIGN SPEECH.
IT WAS A STRONG AND CONFIDENT SPEECH.
IT WAS ENTIRELY SAFE.
VERY BIPARTISAN. VERY ACCEPTABLE.
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING TOO INSPIRING.
I THINK THIS SPEECH IN THE END WAS A BIT BORING.
AND I THOUGHT HE REALLY HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK.
IT WAS GREAT BAD DULL EXCITING. THAT WAS USELESS. (LAUGHTER) SO PANEL DISCUSSIONS AT THIS POINT ARE ALMOST AS ROTE AS THE  PRESIDENT'S SPEECH ITSELF. THAT'S WHY OUR OWN (BLEEP)ING TEAM DOESN'T GET BOGGED DOWN IN PEDANTIC PARTISAN ARGUMENTS  ABOUT THE WORDS USED OR CONTENT. (LAUGHTER) (BLEEP)ING TABLE ON TELEVISION ANALYZES THIS YEAR'S STATE OF THE UNION FROM THE ONE  PERSPECTIVE WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT-- WITHOUT AUDIO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME. SAMANTHA BEE, WYATT CENAC, AL MADRIGAL. THEY HAVE ALL WATCHED THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS LAST NIGHT.
YES, WE DID. >>.
Jon: AND YOU WATCHED IT WITH THE SOUND OFF.
JIM.
AIRPORT.
THROUGH A BEST BUY WINDOW ON THE STREET.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET YOUR TAKES ON THE SPEECH. AL MADRIGAL?
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS "WHAT THE HELL WAS IN JOE BIDEN'S MOUTH?"  LOOK AT HIM WORKING IT. IS HE TRYING TO GET PEANUT BUTTER OUT OF HIS GUMS?
THAT'S HOW THEY GET HORSES TO TALK.
I THINK IT WAS A PUBIC HAIR. I HATE THAT SO MUCH.
WELL, PUBIC HAIRS THEY STICK TO PEANUT BUTTER, RIGHT?
OH, YEAH, THEY DO. BELIEVE ME. I KNOW. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY JUST LIKE A LOZENGE OF SOME SORT.
SOMETHING HE CAN CHEW ON SO HE DOESN'T SHOUT OUT "MOTHER  (BLEEP)ER" FOR NO REASON. (LAUGHTER)
NOT THAT YOU COULD BLAME HIM BECAUSE THAT ROOM IS FULL OF MOTHER (BLEEP)ERS.
Jon: WHY? DID ANYTHING STRIKE YOU?
YEAH, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT MONSTER PLANT ON THAT LADY'S JACKET? I THINK IT'S THE TOP OF HER HEAD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THING DIDN'T SHOUT "FEED ME SEYMOUR."
IT'S LIKE A PLANT THAT CAN BITE YOUR HEAD OFF.
YES!
JON, I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE A MOMENT OF TRUE TRANSCENDENCE CAPTURED BY THE CAMERAS.
Jon: SURE.
GOD HIMSELF GAVE PRESIDENT OBAMA HIS HEAVENLY BLESSINGS. THAT IS QUITE THE ENDORSEMENT IN AN ELECTION YEAR.
Jon: SURE.
AND A BIG (BLEEP) YOU TO MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: BIG. (LAUGHTER)
I'M SORRY, WHO?
Jon: ALL RIGHT, DID ANY OF YOU CATCH THE REPUBLICAN REBUTTAL BY MITCH DANIELS OF INDIANA?
OH, MY GOD! IS THAT WHO THAT WAS?
Jon: UH-HUH.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST OF CALVIN COOLIDGE. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THE REPUBLICAN REBUTTAL WAS CLEARLY A SURREALIST HOMAGE TO "EGG BALANCE ON TOP OF A HAT."
Jon: I GOT MORE OF A "BENJAMIN BUTTON" VIBE. JUST A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE HE GETS SUPER HANDSOME. ANYBODY?
SORRY, JON, PLEASE, IF WE'RE GOING WITH MOVIES THIS IS  OBVIOUSLY "ALBERT NOBBS." IT'S GLENN CLOSE DRESSED LIKE A VICTORIAN GENTLEMEN.
I DON'T SEE IT.
WAIT FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT. OKAY.
OH, YEAH, ALL RIGHT. SNOO.
I THOUGHT THAT GUY LOOKED LIKE ONE OF THOSE SPOOKY PORTRAITS IN A SCOOBY DO HAUNTED  HOUSE WITH THE EYES THAT FOLLOW YOU. RUH-ROH.
Jon: I GET THAT. WELL, LISTEN GUYS THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANALYSIS. THIS MET ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. I THINK FROM NOW ON PANELS SHOULDN'T WATCH THESE SPEECHES.
I AGREE.
WELL DONE.
