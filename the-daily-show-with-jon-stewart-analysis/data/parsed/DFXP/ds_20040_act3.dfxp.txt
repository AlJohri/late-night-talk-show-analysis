I GOT ALL OF THAT. AND A LOT MORE.
Jon:  REALLY?
HOW'S IT GOING, MISTER FELLOW BIG-TIME DIRECTOR?
Jon: IT'S WELL, MR. FELLOW BIG-TIME DIRECTOR, IT'S GOING QUITE WELL. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, SIR.
Jon: IT'S -- I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S-- IT FEELS LIKE-- WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW IS GREAT AND HAS WORKED FOR MANY YEARS AND PUT TOGETHER DIFFERENT THINGS -- IT'S, IT'S LIKE, AND I FELT THIS WAY ABOUT THE SOUTH PARK MUSICAL, "THE BOOK OF MORMON" LIKE A DOCTORAL THESIS. LIKE THIS MOVIE FEELS LIKE YOU'RE DOCTORAL THESIS AND EVERYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED. IT'S JUST ( BLEEP ) GREAT. IT'S GREAT.
AW, THANKS, MAN.
Jon:  AND SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH. AND I -- I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING. AND I DON'T MEAN IN THIS IN A -- I FELL IN LOVE WITH CHRIS ROCK ALL OVER AGAIN WHEN I WATCHED THAT. ( LAUGHTER ).
THANK YOU. I HOPE WE CAN USE THAT QUOTE, LIKE THEY USED ON "BOOK OF MORMON."
Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO. I COULDN'T EVEN GET DISCOUNT TICKETS. EVERY CAB I WENT IN, THERE WAS A QUOTE --
"JON STEWART SAYS IT'S THE BEST PLAY EVER." I'M LIKE, WHEN DID JON STEWART BECOME THE PLAY GUY? ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT DOES JON STEWART THINK OF "OKLAHOMA?" I'M LIKE --
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT'S SAD? SO MY KIDS SEE THAT ON THE TOP OF THE CAB.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THEY GO, "OH, CAN WE GO SEE THAT?" AND I'M LIKE, NO. "YOU SAID IT WAS GREAT." IT'S, IT'S -- NO.
I LIED.
Jon: I LIED. IT'S NO GOOD. THERE'S THIS SONG ABOUT -- NO,  YOU CAN'T GO. YOU CAN'T GO. WHAT IS IT FOR YOU? WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR YOU? YOU KNOW, AS A STAND-UP YOU'RE ALWAYS IN FRONT OF THE AUDIENCE.
YES.
Jon:  SO YOU NEVER ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE YOUR OWN WORK.
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A CHRIS ROCK SHOW.
Jon:  EXACTLY!
I HEAR THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? THEY'RE GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jon:  A LITTLE OVERPRICED, BUT GREAT. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT AS A DIRECTOR, SO YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE WITH THE AUDIENCE YOUR WORK. AND AS THAT -- WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE IS THERE IS IT SUBVERSIVE? IS IT WEIRD. WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?
IT'S SUBVERSIVE. IT'S WEIRD. IT'S THIS -- I MEAN, YOU KNOW THE THING. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE A COMEDIAN. YOU COME UP WITH A JOKE IN THE AFTERNOON. YOU TELL THE JOKE AT 8:30, 9:00 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT, AND YOU GET IT, IMMEDIATE.
Jon: YEAH. AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A MOVIE, YOU COME UP WITH A JOKE, AND THEN A YEAR AND A HALF LATER YOU FIND OUT IF IT WORKED OR NOT.
Jon:  YUP.
YOU KNOW, AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK YOU'RE LIKE OH-MY-GOD, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO.
Jon: BUT THERE AREN'T MANY THAT DON'T WORK IN THERE. AND ESPECIALLY THE SCENES LIKE THAT ONE, THAT WHERE PEOPLE AND THE CAMEOS IN IT. EVERYBODY SCORES IN THIS MOVIE WHICH IS I THINK IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PULL OFF IN A BIG ENSEMBLE.
SANDLER GETS OFF.
Jon: SEINFELD GETS OFF.
SEINFELD, REALLY --
Jon: REALLY GETS OFF.
SEINFELD GETS SOME BIG -- YEAH.
BUT THEY ALL DO. ALL THE PERFORMANCES. AND IT'S DRAMATIC. LIKE, YOU'VE GOT GEARS, MAN. YOU'VE GOT GEARS.
I'M TRYING, MAN! I'M TRYING!
Jon:  NO, IT'S, IT'S GOOD. I LIKE IT.
ROSARIO DAWSON IS IN THERE LOOKING FINE.
Jon:  IT'S AWESOME. AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE? SHE'S LOOKING REAL FINE. BUT WHAT'S NICA, AND BY THE WAY, HE WROTE IN A COUPLE OF SCENES WHERE YOU GET TO--
WE MAKE OUT.
Jon:  PUT YOUR HEAD INSIDE OF HER HEAD WITH THE MOUTH -- BOOM.
YEAH. ( LAUGHTER ) I GOTTA USE MY SUPER POWERS FOR GOOD, RIGHT? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW. I HAD MORE IN THERE BUT SHE TOOK THEM OUT. SHE'S LIKE, "WE DON'T NEED THIS." I'M READING THE PAPER. WHY AM I IN MY PANTIES? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  IS IT NICE FOR YOU? YOU KNOW, I KNOW THERE'S A REAL -- IT'S CHRISTMASTIME.
YUP.
Jon:  THERE'S A REAL HOLE IN THE MOVIE THEATER SCHEDULE NOW THAT THEY'VE TAKEN AWAY-- APPARENTLY THERE'S A MOVIE THAT'S NOT GOING TO RUN AS PLANNED.
REALLY!
Jon:  DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF MORE CHEESE FOR ME OR WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I-- I-- YOU KNOW, I'LL SAY THIS -- MY MOVIE IS VERY KOREAN FRIENDLY. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) I-- I-- WE ALMOST DON'T KILL ANY KOREANS IN IT.
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING --  ( LAUGHTER )
OF ALL OF THE MOVIES OUT, WE KILL THE LEAST AMOUNT OF KOREANS IN OUR MOVIE.
Jon: IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ANY MOVIE THIS YEAR THAT YOU THINK COULD HEAL THE DIVIDE BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH.
I'M JUST SAYING.
Jon:  IT COULD BE "TOP FIVE."
YEAH, YEAH, I MEAN, COME ON. I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT, YOU KNOW, THE EGYPTIANS ARE WHITE IN "EXODUS."
Jon: YEP.
ANNIE'S BLACK. IT'S JUST A WEIRD WORLD RIGHT NOW.
Jon:  IT'S A WEIRD WORLD RIGHT NOW. SO "TAKE FIVE"IS REALLY THE SAFEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE.
YEAH, IT'S THE SAFEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE THERE IS. IT'S FUN FOR KOREANS.
Jon:  I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT.
YEAH. YEAH.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I'M UPSET ABOUT?
WHAT ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT?
Jon: I WRITE A MOVIE ( BLEEP ) ALL OVER THE IRANIAN REGIME, NOTHING. THEY DON'T EVEN CARE. THESE GUYS ARE GETTING ALL THIS PUBLICITY. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'VE GOT A WHOLE THING ABOUT-- AND IT'S NOT EVEN A COMEDY, IT'S REAL-- ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING. THEY HELD THIS GUY IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, YOU TREATED HIM LIKE HELL, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "YEAH..."
THEY'RE LIKE, "YEAH, WE DID THAT."
Jon:  "YEAH, WE DID THAT." NO HACKING. NO THREATS. NO NOTHING. A COUPLE OF THINGS LIKE -- OH YEAH, ZIONIST. LIKE EVEN HALF-HEARTED. LIKE EH, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE "THE INTERVIEW."
Jon: WHEN ARE WE -- DO YOU THINK IT WILL COME OUT? DO YOU THINK IT WILL?
OH IT WILL COME OUT.
Jon:  IT HAS TO, RIGHT?
YES, OF COURSE, IT WILL COME OUT.
Jon: WHY DON'T THEY JUST RELEASE IT?
YOU CAN BUY IT ON 125th STREET RIGHT NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  HOW DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IF KIM JONG UN SHOWED UP ON 125th STREET AND WAS JUST LIKE, "PUT THAT DOWN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" THAT'S AWESOME. I'M SO GLAD FOR YOU. IT'S A GREAT MOVIE. AND CONGRATULATIONS. YOU GOT THE NEXT ONE COOKED UP?
I'M WORKING ON IT. I'M TRYING TO WRITE SOME STAND-UP MAN. I GOTTA GET OUT THERE.
Jon:  YEAH, YOU REALLY NEED TO WORK ON THAT.
YEAH.
Jon: IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME. "TOP FIVE" IT'S IN THE THEATERS NOW, CHRIS ROCK.
