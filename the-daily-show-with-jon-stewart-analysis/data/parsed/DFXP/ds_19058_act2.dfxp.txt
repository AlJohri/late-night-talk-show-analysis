[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELL FOLKS BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY OF CHINA HAS TAKEN ANOTHER GREAT LEAP FORWARD. THIS TIME INTO SPACE. [ LAUGHTER ]
CHINA HAS BECOME JUST THE THIRD COUNTRY TO TAKE A SOFT LANDING ON THE MOON, BEIJING'S NEWEST SPACECRAFT LANDED THERE TODAY. IT CARRIED A SIX WHEELED LUNAR ROVER EQUIPPED WITH FOUR CAMERAS AND TWO MECHANICAL LEGS TO DIG SOIL SAMPLES. IT'S CALLED THE JADE RABBIT.
Jon: EH, YOU KNOW WHAT CHINA, GOOD FA YOU, CHINA. GOOD FA YOU. YEAH THAT'S NICE CHINA, GOOD FA YOU. YEAH YOU KNOW, AMERICA'S APOLLO LUNAR ROVER DATES BACK TO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO THEY CALL IT, 1971 THERE. BUT GOOD FOR YOU. 43 YEARS AGO MEANING NORMALLY THIS IS WHERE I WOULD SAY DURING THE SHOW, SOMETHING LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW -- SUCK IT CHINA! [LAUGHTER]  BUT I SHALL REFRAIN. MAINLY BECAUSE WE WROTE IT IN MOON DUST 43 YEARS AGO. [LAUGHTER] BOOM! I DROPPED A BOMB ON YOU! I'LL EVEN RESTRAIN MYSELF FROM POINTING OUT THAT THE JADE RABBIT, CHINA'S SOURCE OF NATIONAL PRIDE, SHARES THE NAME OF THE POPULAR EROTIC MASSAGER THAT DELIVERS AMAZING DUAL SENSATIONS  AND IS RIBBED FOR EXTRA PLEASURE.  BY THE WAY THAT JADE RABBIT CAN ALSO SEND YOU TO THE MOON. [LAUGHTER] AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT MAKE A VERY DELIGHTFUL AND FLUFFY SO SOUFFLE. [LAUGHTER] BUT WE WISH CHINA'S JADE RABBIT ALL THE BEST, LONG MAY IT ROVE.
THERE IS TROUBLE FOR CHINA'S MOON ROVER. THE LUNAR EXPLORER KNOWN AS JADE RABBIT BROKE DOWN WHILE STUDYING THE MOON'S CRUST. STATE MEDIA REPORTING THE ROVER COULD NOT DEAL WITH THE LUNAR ENVIRONMENT.
Jon: I KNEW THEY SHOULD HAVE SENT THE DILDO. THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD'VE DONE. I SCREWED THAT ALL UP BECAUSE I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET TO THE WORD "DILDO." [ LAUGHTER ] ALL THE OTHER S AND SH SOUNDS ON THE WAY WERE JUST LIKE BANANA PEELS. I'M COMING DILDO, HERE I COME. WOO! YOU KNOW I'M NO MOON EXPERT -- [LAUGHTER] -- BUT I'M PRETTY SURE BEING ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE LUNAR ENVIRONMENT IS WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER A CORE COMPETENCY FOR A LUNAR ROVER. DID THE JADE RABBIT JUST BULL(bleep) ITS WAY THROUGH THAT JOB INTERVIEW? MR. RABBIT I SEE A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HERE ON YOUR RESUME. YOU GOT THE WHEELS THERE, AND YOU GOT THOSE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THAT GRABS THE ROCKS? WE'RE GONNA NEED ONE OF  THOSE, THAT'S EXCELLENT. MY ONLY LAST QUESTIONS IS, HOW COMFORTABLE ARE YOU WITH THE LUNAR ENVIRONMENT? [LAUGHTER] LUNAR ENVIRONMENT, I MEAN, I'M NOT A LUNATIC BUT  I'M WILLING TO LEARN. [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUSLY IT'S A SETBACK FOR CHINA'S GOVERNMENT AND ITS PEOPLE. HOW ARE THEY COPING?
PEOPLE IN CHINA ARE USING THE HASHTAG OF #HANGINTHEREJADERABBIT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HANG IN THERE JADE RABBIT. YOU KNOW IT'S A GO KART, RIGHT? YOU WANT TO GIVE SOMEBODY A PEP TALK THERE'S AN APPLE FACTORY LIKE, TWO BLOCKS DOWN. HOW IS THE JADE RABBIT SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO THIS?
JADE RABBIT POST READ "OOPS, I MIGHT HAVE BROKEN DOWN MY MASTERS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO SAVE ME BUT I MIGHT NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THIS MOON NIGHT." [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HANG IN THERE, JADE RABBIT. I GOT A LITTLE MOON DUST IN THE EYES. CHINA MAY NOT HAVE WON THE RACE FOR SPACE BUT THEY WON THE RACE FOR MOST LYRICAL AND POETIC ROBOT I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. YOU KNOW, ALL WE GET WHEN AMERICAN COMPUTERS FAIL IS LIKE A PUBLIC DOMAIN SONG FROM THE 1800'S. [DEEP ROBOT VOICE] ♪  DAISY, DAISY, GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER DO   YOU CALL THAT MOVING? YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST BREAK OUT  ALEXANDER'S  RAGTIME BAND. LOOK, I REALLY AM (bleep) OLD, AREN'T I? [LAUGHTER]  I JUST FELT THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE GO,  IS THAT GRAVITY, WHAT MOVIE IS THAT? I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, THESE ARE THE ACTUAL WORDS FROM CHINA'S MEDIA ON BEHALF OF THE JADE RABBIT. AND THEY ARE THE NOTEBOOK LEVEL HEART-RENDING. IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S GO OUT TO THE MOON RIGHT NOW. PERHAPS WE CAN JUST HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE OF HIS REAL ACTUAL BEAUTIFUL LAST WORDS.
HELLO, EVERYONE. MY MASTERS FOUND I HAVE A MECHANICAL CONTROL ABNORMALITY, SOME OF MY BODY PARTS WILL NOT OBEY THEIR COMMANDS.
Jon: GODDAMN IT JADE, DON'T YOU QUIT ON ME. DON'T YOU QUIT ON ME JADE RABBIT. DON'T YOU DO IT JADE RABBIT.
THE SUN HAS FALLEN AND THE TEMPERATURE IS DROPPING SO QUICKLY. [ LAUGHTER ] TO TELL YOU ALL A SECRET, I DON'T FEEL THAT SAD. I WAS JUST IN MY OWN ADVENTURE STORY AND LIKE EVERY HERO, I  ENCOUNTERED A SMALL PROBLEM. GOOD NIGHT, EARTH. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, HUMANITY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: GOOD NIGHT, MOON. ♪ DAISY, DAISY GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER DO ♪
Jon: WHY DO THEY ALWAYS SING THAT (bleep) SONG? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
