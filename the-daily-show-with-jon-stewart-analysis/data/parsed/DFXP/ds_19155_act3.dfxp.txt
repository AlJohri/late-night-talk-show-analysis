Jon: THERE WE GO! WELCOME BACK! PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO, I WILL OCCASIONALLY WATCH THE NEWS -- (LAUGHTER) IT APPEARS, BY WATCHING IT, THAT THERE'S BEEN A DISINTEGRATION OF THE WORLD ORDER, OF WHATEVER SORT OF STRUCTURES HAD BEEN BUILT UP OVER THE LAST 20 OR 30 YEARS. IS THAT YOUR SENSE OF IT AS WELL OR IS IT AN EXAGGERATED SENSE OF SOMETHING SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL?
WELL, THERE IS A DISINTEGRATION, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, BUT IT'S EXAGGERATED IN THE SENSE THAT ALL THE NEWS IS BAD, BUT THAT'S THE HEADLINES. THE TRENDLINES ARE MORE GOOD THAN BAD. AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN. THE EXPLOSION IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER FACTORS HAVE MADE POWER MORE DIFFUSE. THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE CAN GIVE CELL PHONES TO FISHERMEN IN INDONESIA IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE TSUNAMI, AND THEIR INCOME GOES UP 30% BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY KNOW WHAT THE REAL PRICE OF FISH IS. THE BAD NEWS IS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY CAN GO TO I.S.I.S. AND THEY CAN BECOME A DROID ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE TWO AUSTRIAN TEENAGE GIRLS PICKED UP AT THE AIRPORT TRYING TO GO THERE AND BLOW PEOPLE UP FOR THEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO POWER IS MORE DIFFUSE, AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE, THEREFORE, MORE INCLUSIVE TO EXERCISE IT. SO THE REASON I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO COMBAT I.S.I.S. HAS A CHANCE TO SUCCEED IS THAT THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT FINALLY INCLUDES SUNNIS WHO WERE REPRESENTING THOSE TRIBAL LEADERS WHO ARE MODERATE AND WITHOUT WHOM I.S.I.S. CANNOT BE DEFEATED. I MEAN, WE CAN GIVE THEM INTELLIGENCE AND WE CAN DO BOMBING AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THEM THAT THERE'S A PRICE FOR DECAPITATING THOSE TWO PEOPLE.
Jon: MM-HMM.
YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH THAT, THAT'S A TERRIBLE SIGNAL TO THE WORLD. BUT WE CAN'T WIN A LAND WAR IN IRAQ. WE PROVED THAT. BUT THEY CAN AND WE CAN HELP THEM WIN IT. AND THAT'S GOT TO BE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. SO, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS THAT'S EFFECTIVE, IT HAS TO BE INCLUSIVE, OTHERWISE, OR IT CAN BE AUTHORITARIAN AND JUST GET RID OF EVERYBODY THEY DISAGREE WITH.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO, THERE'S BASICALLY THREE MODELS GRIPPING THE WORLD. THERE'S THE ENTREPRENEURIAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL MODEL WHICH IS GREAT IF IT'S THE GATES FOUNDATION.
Jon: RIGHT. NOT SO GREAT IF IT'S I.S.I.S.
OR WHAT WE TRY TO DO. AND TERRIBLE IF IT'S I.S.I.S.
Jon: RIGHT.
THERE'S THE AUTHORITARIANISM CAPITALISM MODEL WHICH IS RUSSIA AND IN A DIFFERENT WAY CHINA AND HAS SOME APPEAL LIKE THE HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER, THEY OWE A LOT TO AMERICA, HE JUST SAYS HE LIKED AUTHORITARIAN CAPITALISM, BUT HE'S JUST SAYING I DON'T WANT TO EVER LEAVE POWER.
Jon: RIGHT.
USUALLY THOSE GUYS JUST WANT TO STAY FOREVER AND MAKE MONEY. BUT, AND THEN THERE'S THE DEMOCRACY MODEL. IF THE DEMOCRACY MODEL IS GOING TO WORK, IT HAS TO BE INCLUSIVE. THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY WORKS IN THE MODERN WORLD IS COOPERATION AND GETTING DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER, BRINGING THEIR SKILLS TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE HELPED 400 MILLION PEOPLE IN 180 COUNTRIES BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE NETWORKS OF COOPERATION AND THEY JUST GROW AND GROW. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: DOES THE UNITED STATES THOUGH, DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE TO READJUST IT'S MODEL THEN FOR PROJECTING POWER IN THIS NEW MORE INCLUSIVE WORLD? DO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT A LESS STRENUOUS VERSION OF A PROJECTION OF AMERICAN POWER AND ALSO ACCEPT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT? YOU CAN'T ERADICATE IDEOLOGIES BECAUSE THINGS LIKE 9/11 WERE PLANNED IN A THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN MUNICH. YOU CAN'T...
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT WIN EVERY BATTLE. WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE BASICALLY ARE IN WHAT IS PROBABLY -- WE'RE PROBABLY ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR. A 50-YEAR STRUGGLE TO DEFINE THE TERMS OF OUR INTER-DEPENDENCE. BUT WE KNOW WE ARE INTER- DEPENDENT.
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT IS, ALL THE BORDERS OF THE WORLD LOOK MORE LIKE NETS THAN WALLS. PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS BORDER PROBLEM WE HAD RECENTLY WITH THE CENTRAL AMERICAN KIDS SHOWING UP. THEY MOSTLY WERE RUNNING AWAY FROM GANG VIOLENCE AND NARCOTRAFFICKERS.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE FAR FEWER ILLEGALS CROSSING THIS BORDER NOW THAN WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT AND THE ECONOMY WAS BOOMING AND WE HAD TO BUILD UP THE DEFENSES THERE. WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT DOING NEARLY AS BAD AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE WE CONFUSE THE HEADLINES WITH THE TRENDLINES. EXTREME POVERTY IS DOWN. MATERNAL MORTALITY IS DOWN. KIDS ARE LIVING LONGER.
Jon: MIDDLE CLASS IS RISING AROUND THE WORLD, JUST NOT HERE.
YES. WELL, THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT STRATEGY IN AMERICA. BUT THE EXTREME POVERTY HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY AROUND THE WORLD.
Jon: RIGHT.
IN TINY RWANDA, THE GOVERNMENT CREATED ALL THESE NEW VILLAGES SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DECENT HOUSING AND CREATED STALLS FOR MILK COWS AND PLACES TO STORE THE MILK TO KEEP IT FROM BEING DESTROYED. THAT ONE THING, GIVING A MILK COW TO EVERY RURAL FAMILY TOOK 670,000 PEOPLE OUT OF EXTREME POVERTY...
Jon: WOW.
INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS, THE GLOBAL MIDDLE CLASS. SO WE CAN DO THESE THINGS, BUT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE PATIENCE AND WE CAN'T BE ARROGANT AND WE'VE GOT TO REALIZE INCLUSION WORKS AND UNILATERALISM DOESN'T.
Jon: RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT -- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME FIVE OR TEN MORE MINUTES, AREN'T YOU?
YEAH.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE A NICE MAN. WE'LL BE BACK ON THE WEB. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
