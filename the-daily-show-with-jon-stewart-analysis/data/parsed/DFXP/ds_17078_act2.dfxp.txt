Jon:  WELCOME BACK! WE TURN NOW TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO SPENT MONDAY ON A SOOOUL TRIP! I'M SORRY, I'M BEING TOLD IT'S A TRIP TO SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. MY BAD. THERE, APPARENTLY, THE PRESIDENT MET WITH OTHER WORLD LEADERS TO TALK ABOUT ARMS CONTROL AND TO  PERFORM WITH THE WORLD LEADER TABERNACLE CHOIR. BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW TOUGH IT IS TO BE PRESIDENT. EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A HIGH STEAKS NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT, CAN BE FRAUGHT WITH DOMESTIC POLITICAL PERIL
Jon:  HOT MIC! MR. PRESIDENT, WE CAN HEAR YOU CAPITULATING TO THE RUSSIANS. ALTHOUGH, ON THE PLUS SIDE, MEDVEDEV NO LONGER THAT'S TRANSMIT THAT'S INFORMATION TO VLADIMIR. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S ON THE TV. CAN WE HEAR HIM SAY THAT AGAIN?
Jon:  I TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO VLADIMIR. THAT IS A SENTENCE THAT SHOULD ONLY BE SPOKEN INTO A SHOE PHONE. ( LAUGHTER ). I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SINISTER, BUT IT REALLY DOES SOUND PRETTY  ( BLEEP ) SINISTER, DOESN'T IS IT? "I TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO VLADIMIR." GIVE ME THAT AGAIN. ALL HE'S REALLY SAYING IS, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL HIM. BUT WHEN IT COMES OUT WITH A LITTLE RUSSIAN SAUCE ON IT "I WILL TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION  TO VLADIMIR." I WONDER IF RUSSIA HAS BEEN OUR ENEMY FOR SO MANY YEARS BECAUSE  EVERYTHING THEY SAY SOUNDS EVIL. WE WOULD GO, "HEY, MAN, IS DINNER READY?" AND IN RUSSIAN IT WOULD BE, "HAS  THE BORSCHHT BEEN PREPAREDDED FOR DINNER? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER. THE AUTHORITIES INSIST IT IS NOT BUTTER, BUT, MY LIFE EXPERIENCE TELLS ME OTHERWISE. NOW, I'M SURE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT'S GAFFE WAS SINISTER. BUT I REALLY FEEL IT'S MORE SAD AND VAGUELY PATHETIC. HERE'S THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINING WHAT HE MEANT IN THIS "CAUGHT ON LIVE MIC" MOMENT.
I WANT TO REDUCE OUR NUCLEAR STOCKPILES. FRANKLY, THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO THOSE KINDS OF THOUGHTFUL CLTATIONS. I THINK WE'LL DO BETTER IN 2013.
Jon:  I'D LIKE TO REDUCE THE NUCLEAR STOCKPILES BUT MY  HANDS ARE TIED UNTIL I'M DONE WITH THE, YOU KNOW,... I GOT TO ACT LIKE AN IDIOT UNTIL I GET MY  SECOND TERM AND THEN I CAN DO THE GOOD THINGS. BETWEEN THE LENGTH OF OUR NOMINATING PROCESS AND THE RUN-UP TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND  POSTELECTIONS AND LAME DUCK SESSIONS, WHICH PROBABLY ONLY A QUADRENNIAL THREE-WEEK WINDOW  WHERE THE CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT TO GET SOMETHING ( BLEEP ) DONE ANYWAY. I HOPE IT DOESN'T SNOW DURING THOSE WEEKS. THE WHOLE TIPTOEING AROUND THE ELECTION SEASON MUST SOUND RIDICULOUS TO MEDVEDEV AND PUTIN. I WONDER WHAT THAT WILL SOUND LIKE IN RUSSIAN
