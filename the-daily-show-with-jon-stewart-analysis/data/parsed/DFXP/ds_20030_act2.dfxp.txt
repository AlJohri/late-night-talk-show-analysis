[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW. CHINA, CHINA IS A LAND OF GREAT COMPLEXITY FROM CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES TO WILDLIFE THAT  APPARENTLY CAN'T WORK UP THE ENERGY TO [BLEEP] EACH OTHER. BUT NOW THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC IS TACKLING WHAT MAY BE ITS MOST PRESSING PROBLEM.
THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIA WATCHDOG AGENCY IN CHINA HAS LAUNCHED A CRACKDOWN ON PUNS.
Jon: THE GREAT CHAIRMAN SAYS FROM NOW ON ALL MEANINGS MUST BE LITERAL AND ALL ENTENDRE MUST BE SINGLE. SINGLE I SAY! THERE WILL BE NO PUNS. OH NO, THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S A PUN. YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT. THAT'S ACTUALLY A PUN. YOU HEAR ME? WE DON'T WANT TO OFFEND OUR CHINESE OVERLORDS. SO CAN WE JUST -- NO, THAT'S STILL A PUN. THAT'S NOT ANY BETTER. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HE WAS TURKIC. HE NEVER GOT CLOSER THAN A HUNDRED MILES FROM CHINA. SO I DON'T -- THAT -- YES, THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE. YES. NOW, CHINA'S WORD PLAY POLICY MAY SEEM FRIVOLOUS TO THOSE OF US IN THE WEST. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FOR THE PUBLIC'S OWN GOOD.
THE CRACK DOWN COMES OVER CONCERNS THAT PUNS MIGHT CREATE "MISUNDERSTANDING FOR THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY FOR MINORS."
Jon: NOW SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WOULD PUNS BE ESPECIALLY CONFUSING TO MINERS? NOW, ADMITTEDLY THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD -- OH MY GOD I'M DOING AGAIN. I'M DOING IT AGAIN. I'M SO SORRY, SON OF A BITCH! I APOLOGIZE. NO, THAT'S STILL A PUN. YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN. THAT'S NOT -- PUT IT BACK TO THE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU. [LAUGHING] THIS IS SO HARD. [LAUGHING] WHY DOES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HATE PUNS SO MUCH? WHY DO THEY WORRY IS GONNA HAPPEN?
IT WARNS WORD JOKES CONFUSE AND MISLEAD THE PUBLIC AND COULD LEAD TO "CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC CHAOS."
Jon: IT'S TRUE. IT'S LIKE THAT TIME AMELIA BEDELIA WAS TOLD TO MAKE SPRING ROLLS FOR THE VISITING POLISH AMBASSADOR AND SHE STUFFED HIM WITH ACTUAL SPRINGS. OH, AMELIA BEDELIA, I'M AFRAID YOUR USUALLY DELIGHTFUL MISUNDERSTANDINGS CAUSED A INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT AND UNFORTUNATELY TO EASE THE TENSIONS -- IT'S OKAY. WHEN THEY TOLD HER SHE WAS FACING A FIRING SQUAD SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE MAKING POTTERY. SO SHE'S -- LOOK, I'M NO CHINA EXPERT. PEOPLE. PERHAPS THEIR GOVERNMENT TRULY FEARS THAT THEIR COUNTRY RISKS BEING OVERRUN BY A SCOURGE OF PEKING DUCKS, OR KOI PONDS, OR GREEN TEA. BUT CHINA, CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE LOSING. THE PUN IS A RICH LITERARY TRADITION. ONE BRACED, HONED AND PERFECTED BY THE LIKES OF SHAKESPEARE. JOHN DONNE. JAMES JOYCE. THE PUN IS A LINGUISTIC DANCE. WIT PIROUETTING IN THE SPACE WHERE SOUND MEETS MEANING. ESPECIALLY ELEGANT IN A LANGUAGE AS SUBTLE AND COMPLEX AS CHINESE. WHERE A SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT IN TONE CAN UP END THE ENTIRE ESSENCE OF A PHRASE. A WORLD WITHOUT THE PUN THAT, GOOD SIR, IS NO WORLD AT ALL.
JOKERS IN CHINA CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED. YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO PUN.
Jon: YOU KNOW, I STAND CORRECTED. BAN THAT [BLEEP]. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [ APPLAUSE ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
