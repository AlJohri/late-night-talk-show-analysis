FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT ANJAN SUNDARAM. ANJAN SUNDARAM HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT HIS TIME IN THE  CONGO. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT OVERSEAS IN A LAND SO CENTRAL TO WORLD FUNCTION THAT THE MOST MAJOR ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL DECISIONS MUST BE MADE THERE. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT SWITZERLAND. I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT SWITZERLAND. [ LAUGHTER ] YES. [SFX: THUNDER, CUCKOO CLOCK] YES THOSE CHOCOLATE MAKING CLOCK SUCKERS HAVE MADE THEMSELVES THE DESTINATION FOR THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS. IMPRESSING WITH THEIR RESOURCEFULNESS AND LET'S CALL THEIR AMORAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS NAZI GOLD NEUTRALITY. SO WHO'S IN SWITZERLAND?
THE RICH AND POWERFUL ARE AT THE ANNUAL WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN SWITZERLAND NOW.
Jon: RICH AND POWERFUL. I WONDER WHERE THE RICH AND POWERLESS GATHER? ANYWAY. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
A WAR OF WORDS IN GENEVA.
Jon: NOW WE'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.
FIREWORKS FLY AT THE START OF THE SYRIAN PEACE CONFERENCE.
FIGHTING WORDS.
TEMPERS ARE FLARING.
Jon: A WORD WAR. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S THE WORST KIND OF WAR. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW MY GRANDPA SERVED THREE TOURS IN WORD WAR II. [ LAUGHTER ] I REMEMBER HE CAME HOME. SOMEBODY CALLED HIM A (bleep) AND -- [LAUGHTER] -- HE GOT THAT FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS EYES... LIKE HE WAS THINKING ABOUT GRAMMAR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT APPARENTLY NOT ONLY ARE THE RICH AND POWERFUL GATHERING IN DAVOS BUT DIPLOMATS  SIMULTANEOUSLY CONVERGING IN MONTREUX SWITZERLAND TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO SYRIA'S BRUTAL 3-YEAR CIVIL WAR AND THEY ARE THE ONES ENGAGING IN A WORD WAR. THE SITUATION HAS DETERIORATED TO THE POINT THAT EVEN THE DELEGATES HANDSHAKES HAVE TO PASS THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY. [ LAUGHTER ] TO THE WORD WAR.
YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK, I LIVE IN SYRIA. I HAVE THE RIGHT TO GIVE THE SYRIAN VERSION HERE IN THIS FORUM.
YES, OF COURSE.
AFTER THREE YEARS OF SUFFERING THIS IS MY RIGHT AS A SYRIAN.
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE AND HARMONIOUS DIALOGUE. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM ANY INFLAMMATORY--
YOU SPOKE 25 MINUTES. AT LEAST I NEED TO SPEAK 30 MINUTES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S YOUR WORD WAR? THAT LITTLE EXCHANGE WOULD QUALIFY AS THE NICEST SEDER I'VE EVER BEEN TO. [LAUGHTER] SERIOUSLY, I'VE SEEN GAMES  OF SCRABBLE THAT HAVE GOTTEN UGLIER THAN THAT. SINBAD IS A PROPER NOUN (bleep). SO WHAT'S THE STICKING POINT HERE?
ASSAD HAS ANNOUNCED, AS OF A FEW DAYS AGO, HE'S RUNNING FOR REELECTION.
Jon: REELECTION. WHAT?  [LAUGHTER] OH, NO, REELECTION! WELL I HOPE HIM GASSING HIS OWN PEOPLE DOESN'T HURT HIM IN THE PRIMARIES. [LAUGHTER] SO NOTHING'S GETTING DONE IN  MONTREUX. HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE MORE SUCCESS UP THE STRASSE IN DAVOS.
HE'S IN DAVOS TO BREAK DOWN ALL OF THIS. WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING.
HERE AT DAVOS THE VIEW IS THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH  INEQUALITY. IT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THE SALONS, IN THE BARS, IN THE RESTAURANTS.
Jon: YES, INEQUALITY. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THE CIGAR LOUNGES AND THE CHAMPAGNE PAVILIONS AND IN THE COCAINE-ATORIUMS. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IT INSIDE THE SAME SHARED ESCORTS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE PRIORITY IS HELPING THE LESS FORTUNATE. ALRIGHT SO A GROUP OF THE WORLD'S WEALTHIEST PEOPLE GET TOGETHER IN AN ENCLOSED MOUNTAIN ENCLAVE TO DISCUSS CONCERNS OVER INCOME INEQUALITY. HMMM.
MY COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING AN ARGUMENT. SHE BELIEVES, TO SOME EXTENT, IT'S HYPOCRISY HERE AT DAVOS. THEY COME HERE AND TALK ABOUT THE HAVENOTS BUT IT'S THE HAVES THAT HAVE THEIR NOSES IN THE TROUGH.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T AGREE WITH IT. I BELIEVE THE REAL HYPOCRISY ARE THE POOR PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY BUT COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO COME TO DAVOS. [ LAUGHTER ] SHOWS LACK OF COMMITMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] HEY BUT AT LEAST THEY ARE TALKING  ABOUT THE ISSUE. HOW BAD IS THE INCOME INEQUALITY ISSUE NOW ANYWAY?
THE POORER HALF OF THE  WORLD'S PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AS THE RICHEST 85 PEOPLE ON EARTH.
Jon: JESUS CHRIST  WOULD NOT BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT STATISTIC. [LAUGHTER] 85 PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WEALTH AS THE POPULATION OF CHINA, INDIA AND ALL OF AFRICA AND AUSTRALIA. 85 PEOPLE. THERE'S MORE PEOPLE IN ARCADE FIRE THAN THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL TELL WHAT YOU WHAT. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. THIS THING THIS LITTLE ENCLAVE, THIS MEETING. IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN SECRET. THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING WATCHED. I BET THERE'S FINANCIAL JOURNALISTS ALL OVER THIS CONFERENCE TO COMFORT THE THE AFFLICTED AND AFFLICT THE COMFORTABLE. THROUGH, I'M ASSUMING, HARD HITTING, TAKE NO PRISONERS, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM.  LET'S GO TO THEM NOW. WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT BILLIONAIRES. THIS PLACE HERE, TE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM, IS A MAGNET  FOR THEM.
I'VE BEEN EATING THE CHEESY SWISS FONDUE.
LAST NIGHT THE PROPRIETOR OF OUR HOTEL GAVE US A PRIVATE RIDE IN HIS CAR BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET A TAXI. AND I THINK THAT IS VIP TREATMENT.
THERE'S A HIERARCHY HERE, SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN ALL ACCESS BADGE--  YES, WE WERE ABLE TO GET THIS, FOX BUSINESS ROCKS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT IS WITH THE GIDDINESS? ARE YOU FINANCIAL JOURNALISTS OR JUST EXCITED TO BE INVITED TO THE MONEY OSCARS? [LAUGHTER] HEY HEY! I LOVED YOU IN THE REAL LIFE EVENTS THEY LATER BASED THE WOLF OF WALL STREET ON. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. FOR MORE ON THE PEACE TALKS IN MONTREUX WE GO TO SENIOR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES.
JON, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ACTUALLY HERE. AND I HAVE SCORED AN ALL ACCESS PASS TO SOME OF THE MOST HORRIFIC CHRONICLING OF HUMAN MISERY WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES. YEAH, "THE DAILY SHOW" ROCKS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU THERE, JASON. WHAT'S THE LATEST FROM THE SYRIAN PEACE TALKS?
HERE AT THE MONTREUX PALACE HOTEL IT'S AAALL ABOUT RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH THE MOVERS AND SHAKERS OF DIPLOMACY. CHECK OUT MY INSTAGRAM FEED. [LAUGHTER, CHEERS] YEAH, THAT'S ME WITH SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WALID MUALLEM. THAT GUY IS A MADMAN. NO, SERIOUSLY HE'S A MADMAN.
Jon: YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE THE SUMMIT IN MONTREUX IS EVERY BIT AS FRIVOLOUS AND STAR-[bleep]ING AS THE ONE IN DAVOS.
Samantha: WOAH WOAH WOAH, I'M SORRY, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE JON.
Jon: I'M SORRY, SAMANTHA BEE IS THAT YOU? [APPLAUSE]
YES, JON I'M HERE IN DAVOS, OKAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE'S NOTHING FRIVOLOUS GOING ON HERE. THE LEADERS AT THE  WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM ARE LASER FOCUSED ON MAKING THIS A FAIRER AND MORE EQUAL PLANET.
Jon: I'M SORRY, REALLY? BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE AT A PARTY. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE AT A PARTY AT GATSBY'S HOUSE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT JOHN, BUT I HOPE YOU ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT DAVOS IS JUST SOME KIND OF ORGY OF SELF CONGRATULATORY EXCESS.
Jon: I NEVER SAID, ORGY, SAM.
Samantha: OK, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE INSULTING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU ARE LITERALLY AT AN ORGY RIGHT NOW AREN'T YOU SAM?
IT IS A PANEL ON EMERGING ECONOMIES AND IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I HAVE SOME SERIOUS REPORTING TO DO.
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, JASON JONES WITH US TONIGHT FROM SWITZERLAND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
