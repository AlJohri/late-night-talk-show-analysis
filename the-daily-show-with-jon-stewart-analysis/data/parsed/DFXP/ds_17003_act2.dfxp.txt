Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, AS YOU KNOW, AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU LIVE AND BREATH, MY  FRIENDS, OUR POLITICAL PARTIES SELECT THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES THROUGH THE PRIMARY SYSTEM. A MULTI-YEAR PROCESS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT WHEN WE DECIDE THE PERSON WHO WILL HAVE CONTROL  OVER OUR NATION'S DESTINY, WE HAVE A BUNCH OF PICTURES OF THEM EATING A CORN DOG. [LAUGHTER] LAST WEEKEND ONE OF OUR MORE REBELLIOUS STATES DECIDED IT'S NOT HAPPY WITH HOW THINGS ARE.
FLORIDA IS TALKING ABOUT MOVING UP ITS PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. I MEAN, WAY UP THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT MOVING IT UP. THAT COULD MEAN CHAOS ON THE CALENDAR THIS WINTER. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN OUR POLITICAL TICKER. THAT'S COMING UP. IT'S 12 MINUTES PAST THE HOUR. ♪ THE PEOPLE THAT YOU FIND WHATEVER YOU MAY NEED ♪♪
Jon: REALLY? "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE" OVER OLD PEOPLE VOTING, "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE"? ♪ WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE WE WEAR LONG BLACK SOCKS WITH SHORTEDS AND EAT OUR LUNCH AT  3:00 ♪♪ GUNS AND ROSES HAS MORE APPROPRIATE MUSIC FOR THIS SCENE.
OF COURSE, THAT'S SEVERAL WEEKS EARLIER THAN IS USUAL. WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN OUR POLITICAL TICKER. ♪ KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCKING ON HEAVEN'S DOOR ♪ HEY, HEY, HEY ♪♪
Jon: ALL RIGHT. ANYWAY, I'M SORRY. I GOT DISTRACTED BY THE MUSIC. YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT FLORIDA.
THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE OF FLORIDA JUST VOTED AN HOUR AGO  TO MOVE ITS PRIMARY UP AN ENTIRE MONTH TO JANUARY 31st.
THIS MOVE WILL LIKELY THROW THE CAREFULLY ARRANGED REPUBLICAN NOMINATING CALENDAR  INTO DISARRAY AND JUMPSTART THE NOMINATING PROCESS A MONTH EARLIER THAN PARTY LEADERS HAD HOPED.
Jon: I GUESS WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. IF THERE'S ONE STATE THAT'S GOING TO START A [BLEEPED] CONTEST, IT'S HARDLY SURPRISING IT'S THE ONE SHAPED LIKE A  [BLEEPED]. COME ON, FLORIDA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YES, WE'RE QUITE SOPHISTICATED. AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE YOU'VE CAUSED US, FLORIDA, PREVIOUS ELECTION, YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO  DEMAND TO VOTE EARLIER. YOU'RE LUCKY WE EVEN LET YOU VOTE AT ALL. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY WE LET IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTE FIRST? BECAUSE THEY'VE EARNED OUR TRUST. WHEN WE LET THEM USE OUR VOTES, THEY DON'T WRING IT BACK WITH SWAMP WATER IN THE ENGINE AND ALLIGATOR MEAT IN THE GRILL AND  HANGING CHADS ALL OVER THE WINDSHIELD AND PAT BUCHANAN'S NAME SPRAY PAINTED ON THE APULL INDUSTRY. WHY ARE YOU EVEN DOING THIS?
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE EARLY PRIMARY DATES THAT ARE REALLY IN  SMALL STATES AND STATES THAT ARE NOT DIVERSE IN POPULATION, AND IT'S TIME FOR A BIG STATE, POPULATED STATE AND A MINORITY REPRESENTED STATE TO BE REPRESENTED.
Jon: OH, SNAP. DID YOU SEE THAT, NEW HAMPSHIRE. OH, [BLEEPED], YOU'RE SO HOMOGENIZED YOU MAKE MILK JEALOUS. OH, BOO. OH, YOU'RE SO WHITE YOU CALL SNOW CAMOUFLAGE. BOO. OH, [BLEEPED], YOU'RE SO WHITE YOU GOT NERVOUS WHEN VERMONT MOVED INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW WHAT SONG I SHOULD PLAY. SLAM. BUT THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER MORE INSIDIOUS REASON WHY FLORIDA IS SO ANXIOUS TO BE FIRST.
YOU GET ATTENTION TO YOUR ISSUES. LET'S REMEMBER, THIS WE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE THE NATIONAL SUBSIDY FOR ETHANOL THAT WE HAVE  IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY IF IOWA, IF BOTH PARTIES DIDN'T HAVE TO START THEIR PRESIDENTIAL  PROCESS IN IOWA. THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT GET SPECIAL ATTENTION IF YOU ARE IN THIS CHOSEN CLASS OF EARLY  PRIMARY STATE.
Jon: GREAT. NOW THE PARTIES WILL PANDER TO FLORIDA VOTEDDERS. NOW THERE WILL BE A FEDERAL LAW REQUIRING US TO VISIT OUR GRANDPARENTS. AND WHAT'S NEXT? THIS BECOMES A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
WE'LL NEVER BE SICK. WE WON'T GET ANY OLDER AND WE WON'T EVER DIE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: TO BE FAIR, THAT IS QUITE APPEALING. REFERENDUM. BUT IF YOU THINK THE OTHER STATES WILL JUST LET FLORIDA STEAL THEIR THUNDER, THINK AGAIN, BUDDY.
THE OTHER EARLY PRIMARY AND CAUCUS STATES ARE ALL BUT CERTAIN TO MOVE THEIR CONTESTS  UP, AS WELL. THE IOWA CAUCUSES COULD NOW COME AS EARLY AS JANUARY 9th FOLLOWED BY NEW HAMPSHIRE, NEVADA AND SOUTH CAROLINA.
AT WHICH POINT FLORIDA WILL MOVE ITS DATE BACK TO NOVEMBER 15th AND NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL  MOVE IT UP TO NOVEMBER 30th. LONG STORY SHORT THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES ALREADY HAPPENED AND DONALD TRUMP IS THE PARTY'S NOMINEE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
