John: WELCOME BACK. FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS WE'VE  BEEN FOLLOWING THE SAGA OF  N.S.A. CONTRACTOR SLASH VILLAIN EDWARD SNOW DISEN. WHEN WE LAST CHECKED IN HE WAS  IN HONG KONG WITH WHOM WE HAVE  AN EXTRADITION TREATY SO ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE COMES  FLYING HOME, RIGHT?
EDWARD SNOWDEN HOPPED A  FLIGHT OUT OF HONG KONG EARLY  THIS MORNING OUR TIME HEADED FOR  MOSCOW.
John: TO GET A CONNECTING  FLIGHT TO JUSTICE TOWN, RIGHT? NOW, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, HOW  DID THAT HAPPEN? WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS IN CONSTANT  CONTACT WITH HONG KONG  AUTHORITIES.
THEY'RE BACK AND FORTH ON THE  PHONE TALKING LIKE, DO YOU STILL  KNOW WHERE HE IS? YES, WE STILL KNOW WHERE HE IS. ALL THAT IS GOING VERY SMOOTHLY  UP UNTIL FRIDAY. THEN FIRST OF ALL THEY STOPPED  CALLING BACK.
John: YES, YOU HEARD RIGHT. HONG KONG SIMPLY STOPPED  RETURNING OUR CALLS. BASICALLY THE UNITED STATES, THE  MOST POWERFUL GOVERNMENT ON  EARTH, WAS TURNED INTO A SAD  EX-BOYFRIEND. HEY, CHINA, IT'S AMERICA. COULD YOU CALL ME AGAIN? MAKE SURE YOU GOT OUR EARLIER  MESSAGES AND TKSES AND EMAILS. NOT SURE WHERE YOU ARE. IN THE SHOWER SO I THOUGHT MAYBE  I MISSED YOUR CALL. JUST CHECKING ON THAT WHOLE  EXTRADITION THING WE TALKED  ABOUT. MAYBE GIVE US A CALL OR DON'T. IT'S COOL. IT'S NOT COOL. PLEASE DO CALL. IT'S AMERICA. IT'S AMERICA CALLING. I LOVE YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO THE GUYS GOT ON A PLANE TO  MOSCOW. THAT'S LIKE A CUP-AND-BALL TRICK  WITH ONE CUP. ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS KEEP OUR  EYES ON THAT PLANE.
THIS IS A LIVE LOOK INSIDE  THE MOSCOW AIRPORT IN RUSSIA.
HERE IS THE CAMERA ON THAT  AIRPLANE.
WE'RE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF  THE TERMINAL. WE BELIEVE THIS IS WHERE EDWARD  SNOWDEN WOULD COME.
HE HAD A SEAT ON A FLIGHT  FROM MOSCOW TO CUBA. HE'S NOT ON THAT PLANE.
SEVERAL JOURNALISTS ARE ON  BOARD WHO HAD HOPED TO INTERVIEW  HIM.
A REPORTER WHO DID GET ON  BOARD, EVEN TWEETED THE EMPTY  SEAT WHERE SNOWDEN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SITTING.
John: THAT'S RIGHT. SOMEHOW EDWARD SNOWDEN'S FLIGHT  IN MOSCOW ENDED WITH A DOZEN  JOURNALISTS ON A RUSSIAN AIRLINER 12-HOUR FLIGHT TO CUBA  THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN WASN'T EVEN  ON ALL SO THEY COULD GET COLLECTIVELY 12 EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS  OF AN EMPTY CHAIR. THEY WERE LITERALLY REPORTING ON  NOTHING. UNLESS, UNLESS EDWARD SNOWDEN'S  TECHNOLOGY IS SO ADVANCED THAT  HE IS WEARING AN INVISIBLE SUIT. SORRY. SO SNOWDEN HAS DISAPPEARED. THE MEDIA NOW HAS A CLEAR  CHOICE. EITHER YOU ACCEPT THAT, WAIT FOR  DEVELOPMENTS, OR...
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS EDWARD  SNOWDEN?
WE WERE TOLD OR WE THOUGHT  ANYWAY IT WAS ROARED ANYWAY THAT  HE WAS FLYING TO HAVANA CUBA.
AND ON CONVENIENCE WAIL A. HE DID APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN  ICELAND.
FOR ALL WE KNOW HE'S HAVING  LUNCH AT THE ECUADOR AND  EMBASSY.
WHATEVER THE TRUTH WE BELIEVE  IT'S IN MOSCOW RIGHT NOW.
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING FOR  SURE.
THIS IS ALL SPECULATION AT  THIS POINT.
John: THEN STOP GUESSING. STOP IT! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] STOP GUESSING. NEWS IS NOT A GAME SHOW. YOU DON'T WIN A CAR IF YOU  HAPPEN TO BE RIGHT. ALTHOUGH IF IT WAS LIKE A GAME  SHOW AT LEAST WHEN YOU GOT  EVERYTHING WRONG, YOU WOULD NOT BE INVITED BACK THE NEXT DAY. BUT, LOOK. LET'S BE FAIR. IT'S NOT THE NEWS ORGANIZATION'S  JOB TO FIND SNOWDEN. THE GOVERNMENT IS ON THE CASE.
WE DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY  WHERE HE MAY HEAD OR WHAT HIS  INTENDED DESTINATION MAY BE.
John: WOW. SO, THIS IS EITHER INCREDIBLY  EMBARRASSING FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR THE MOST BRILLIANT  THING THEY COULD POSSIBLY DO. BECAUSE FOR A WHILE THERE EDWARD  SNOWDEN HAD ME BELIEVING THAT  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WAS ALL SEE, ALL KNOWING AND ALL POWERFUL. BUT AFTER THIS WEEKEND, THEY'VE  GOT ME EVEN MORE CONVINCED THAT  THEY COULDN'T FIND THE FRONT OF A HUMAN SENT PEED IF THEIR MOUTH  WAS STRUNG TO ITS ARSE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
