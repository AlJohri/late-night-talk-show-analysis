FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HEY, EVERYBODY. YOU ARE HERE ON A FINE NIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE GUEST TONIGHT MR. GEORGE CLOONEY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M GOING TO LET YOU ENJOY THAT FOR A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE FIRST WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SYRIA. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS KIND OF THE SPINACH OF  WORLD NEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU GOTTA EAT IT BEFORE YOU GET YOUR CLOONEY SUNDAE. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW BAD HAVE THINGS GOTTEN IN  SYRIA? MORE THAN TWO MILLION REFUGEES HAVE FLED THE COUNTRY. HOMS STILL UNDER AERIAL BOMBARDMENT AFTER MORE THAN A YEAR. CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING. HISTORICAL SITES POUNDED INTO RUBBLE BUT NOT TO WORRY PEOPLE, THE WORLD IS FINALLY GETTING TOGETHER TO -- NO, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT THAT EXAMPLE. THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] COMING UP ON ROUND TWO OF THE SYRIAN PEACE TALKS IN GENEVA. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A RECAP FROM THE ALGERIAN U.N. SPECIAL ENVOY TO SYRIA. LET'S START WITH HOMS. WHAT IS THE WORD ABOUT HOMS?
IN HOMS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY, OKAY. HEY, MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE THAT'S JUST ONE CITY, MAN. THIS IS THE U.N., THIS IS THE UNITED STATES THIS IS THE WEST AND THE EAST GETTING TOGETHER. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PRISONERS. THE KIDNAPPED PEOPLE, THE DISAPPEARED PEOPLE?
AND ABOUT PRISONERS, KIDNAPPED PEOPLE, DISAPPEARED PEOPLE, AGAIN HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SYRIA IS SO BROKEN EVEN ALGERIAN HENRY KISSINGER  IS LIKE (bleep) IT I'M OUT OF IDEAS. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS THE CLEAREST SIGN YET OF JUST HOW BAD THINGS HAVE GOTTEN IN SYRIA.
AL QAEDA IS CUTTING TIES WITH ONE GROUP FOR BEING TOO EXTREME.
AL QAEDA'S GENERAL COMMAND ISSUED A STATEMENT DISTANCING ITSELF FROM ISIL SAYING AL QAEDA DOESN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH IT AND ISN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.
Jon: DID YOU GET THAT? AN AL QAEDA AFFILIATE IN SYRIA IS SO EXTREME, AL QAEDA IS LIKE -- [LAUGHTER] -- HOW BIG OF AN (bleep) DO YOU HAVE TO BE BEFORE AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI, THE COMMANDER OF AL QAEDA, BIN LADEN'S FORMER RIGHT HAND MAN, GOES   I CAN'T WORK WITH THESE GUYS. [LAUGHTER] THESE GUYS ARE MANIACS. SO WHAT HAPPENED?
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE DISAVOWAL MAY BE THAT AL-BAGHDADI'S DEFIANCE WAS BEGINNING TO THREATEN  AL-ZAWAHIRI'S AUTHORITY.
Jon: REALLY. THE VIOLENT INSURGENTS AL QUEDA CHOSE TO WORK WITH IN SYRIA  WENT ALL, VIOLENT INSURGENT. [LAUGHTER] WHO SAW THAT COMING? THAT'S THE BIGGEST PLOT TWIST SINCE THE END OF GRIZZLY MAN. REALLY, SO THE GUY WHO JUST WANDERED INTO THE WILDERNESS TO LIVE WITH BEARS GOT EATEN BY A BEAR. [LAUGHTER] WHO SAW THAT COMING. SO WHAT DID THIS PARTICULAR GROUP DO?
IT'S KILLED CIVILIANS, BEHEADED INDIVIDUALS,  ALIENATED A LOCAL POPULATION.
Jon: YOU KNOW IT'S A RELATIVELY REDUNDANT STATEMENT. IT'S BEHEADED INDIVIDUALS AND ALIENATED THE LOCAL POPULATION. YEAH, THEY BEHEADED INDIVIDUALS BUT IN THE BAD WAY, YEAH, I CAN SEE HOW THAT'S SOMEWHAT ALIENATING. BY THE WAY, HOW FORGIVING IS THE LOCAL POPULATION THAT BEHEADINGS IS WHAT PUT THEM OVER THE TOP? [LAUGHTER] I MEAN IN NEW YORK CITY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TRY TO BUILD A WAL-MART AND EVERYBODY FREAKS THE (bleep) OUT. ALL IN ALL A CHALLENGE FOR AL QAEDA'S TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM.
WHEN IT GETS TO THE POINT WHEN AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI HAS TO COME OUT IN PUBLIC AND PLEAD WITH THE TWO AL QAEDA AFFILIATES NOT TO KILL EACH OTHER THAT'S NOT A SIGN OF GOOD COMMAND AND CONTROL THAT  BIN LADEN WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO PLEAD.
Jon: WOW THAT'S GOTTA STING. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW ZAWAHIRI IS SICK OF HEARING THAT. OH, YOU WANT TO KILL THEM LIKE THAT? NO, NO, IT'S GOOD... IT'S NOT HOW BIN LADEN WOULD KILL THEM. I MEAN, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT EVIL IT'S EVIL IT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW. I GET IT WE ALL MISS OSAMA. ZAWAHIRI, HE CAN'T BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS. HE CAN'T BE. THIS IS A VERY, VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY AND A VERY SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO THE FUTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION HE HAS SPENT SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO BUILD. THIS MUST KEEP AYMAN AL-ZAWAHIRI AWAKE IN HIS BED AT NIGHT IN  PAKISTAN.
Jon: AWWW. BOO BOO BOO BOO BOO. WELL, I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT BEFORE THAT HE WAS SLEEPING LIKE A BABY. YEAH, I KILLED ALL THOSE PEOPLE BUT IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME BUT THESE ORGANIZATIONAL BUREAUCRACY ARRGH. BUT LISTEN. WHEN ZAWAHIRI TRIES TO CHALLENGE THIS HE WILL DO THE BEST HE CAN. FOR MORE WE GO OUT TO SENIOR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE SHE'S IN BEIRUT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SAM, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANKS FOR JOINING US FROM BEIRUT.
YES, BEIRUT.
Jon: ZAWAHIRI'S AUTHORITY IN AL QAEDA IS BEING THREATENED BY THESE NEW RENEGADE AL QAEDA GROUPS AND LEADERS.
YES.
Jon: HOW DOES HE REGAIN CONTROL OF AL QAEDA?
JON, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, MO-MULLAH, MO PROBLEMS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NOBODY SAYS, THAT SAM.
I KNOW. JUST TRYING TO MAKE THAT PHRASE HAPPEN THOUGH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHAT HAS ZAWAHIRI DONE SO FAR?
WELL, THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A STERNLY WORDED MEMO RE:  BEHEADINGS TO ALL STAFF BASICALLY STATING THAT ANY UNAUTHORIZED BEHEADINGS WOULD BE GROUNDS FOR BEHEADINGS.
Jon: UH HUH, I SEE.
AND ALSO THAT MANAGEMENT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNLABELED HUMMUS IN THE FRIDGE.
Jon: SURE, SURE. [ LAUGHTER ] SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR.
THE ISIL GUYS ARE NOT HAVING IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL AL QAEDA MANAGEMENT? TINO'S:  TERRORISTS IN NAME ONLY.
Jon: WOW. [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT DOES AL QAEDA DO NOW?
WELL, YOU REBOOT THE FRANCHISE, OK? YOU TRY TO ATTRACT A DIFFERENT CALIBER OF MANIAC. I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THE ADS.
HERE'S TO THE CRAZY ONES. THE RELENTLESS, MURDEROUS, IDEOLOGICAL TERRORISTS OFFERING VERY LITTLE TO SOCIETY OTHER THAN CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION. BUT NOT SO CRAZY THEY FORGET THERE'S A WELL ESTABLISHED CHAIN OF COMMAND. HERE IS TO THOSE WILLING TO BEHEAD ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH THEM, BUT WON'T JUST WANDER OFF BEHEADING WILLY-NILLY; JUST THE ONES WE HAD AGREED IN ADVANCE WERE BEHEADABLE. HERE IS TO EXTREMISM IN MODERATION.
Jon: THINK THAT'S GOING TO WORK? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IF IT DOESN'T WORK THEIR AD AGENCY IS IN BIG TROUBLE.
Jon: THANK YOU, SAM. SAMANTHA BEE FROM BEIRUT, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
