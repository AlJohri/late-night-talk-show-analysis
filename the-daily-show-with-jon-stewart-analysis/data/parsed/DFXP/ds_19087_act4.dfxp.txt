[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY. JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00. BUT BEFORE WE GO. NOT THAT ANYONE WAS WATCHING BECAUSE OF THE NCAA TOURNAMENT FINAL GAME BUT SERIOUSLY UNDERTAKER LOSING TO BROCK LESNAR. NO THAT IS NOT HOW THIS STREAK IS SUPPOSED TO END! THAT IS NOT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN. YOU MUST RISE UNDER -- NO? JUST ME? FAIR ENOUGH. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
I THINK I TOLD TONY I WAS PAINTING HIM AND HE KIND OF BRUSHED IT OFF, SO TO SPEAK.
NO ART PUN INTENDED THERE.
IT WAS AN ART PUN.
OKAY.
