Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A VERY FUNNY ACTOR AND COMEDIAN. HE STARS ON ABC'S "THE GOLDBERGS."
HEY YOU GOT A SEC? I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A TALK, MAN TO MAN.
REALLY? OKAY.
I'VE NEVER BEEN A GREAT COMMUNICATOR, SO I THINK I SHOULD KEEP THINGS AS DIRECT AND EXACT AS POSSIBLE.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO HAVE THE TALK WE'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE TALK. WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME ROLE PLAYING. I'M GOING TO BE THE GIRL. YOU'LL BE THE BOY AND WE'RE GOING TO LEARN WHERE BABIES COME FROM WITH OUR HANDS.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW JEFF GARLIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ♪ -- ♪  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] JEFF GARLIN IS HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL CAMERA. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY MADE THOSE ANYMORE.
IT'S A RANGE FINDER. IT'S A LEICA M MONOCHROME. IT'S A LEICA M MONOCHROME. YOU MENTIONED MY NAME AND NOT MUCH OF A REACTION AND YOU SAID LET'S PUT HIS PICTURE UP AND LET THEM KNOW HE IS COMING OUT SOON.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU WHY I'VE BROUGHT YOU ON. NOT THAT WE'VE WITHIN FRIENDS MANY, MANY YEARS AND THAT WE'RE CLOSE AND I LOVE YOU.
YES.
Jon: HERE IS WHY I BROUGHT YOU ON.
TELL ME.
Jon: AS A MEMBER OF CAST OF THE GOLDBERGS YOU ARE AT THE FOREFRONT PUTTING A POSITIVE FACE ON A JEWISH FAMILY ON TELEVISION. [LAUGHTER] FOR MAYBE THE FIRST TIME TO ME MY MISBOOKAH COSBY.
I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY.
Jon: TO SEE A JEWISH FATHER NONTHREATENING WITH A CAREER IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
I'M VERY THREATENING ON THE SHOW.
Jon: I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SHOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
I'M GRUMPY. I'M IN TIGHTY WHITEYS ALL THE TIME. IT'S NOT THE IMAGE MOST JEWS WOULD LIKE.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YEAH.
Jon: WOULD JEWS EVER AGREE ON WHAT IMAGE?
NO, NO. OH, MY GOD, NO.
Jon: IN MY FAMILY WE CAN'T AGREE ON WHAT CHANNEL TO WATCH THE FOOTBALL GAME ON. EITHER HD OR SD THAT'S A FIGHT. THAT'S HOW (bleep) UP WE ARE. DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT? YOU LOOK GREAT.
I'M LOSING WEIGHT AT ALL TIMES. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM. LET ME JUST SAY THIS, I'LL KNOW WHEN I'VE LOST ENOUGH WEIGHT WHEN PEOPLE STOP ASKING ME TO PLAY CHRIS CHRISTIE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S WHEN I'LL KNOW.
Jon: YOU GUYS ULTIMATELY WILL END UP PLAYING HIM ANYWAY AS YOU LOSE WEIGHT HE IS LOSING WEIGHT AND IT'S YOU AND HIM IN A MOVIE ABOUT GOING TO THE GYM. YOU ARE BOTH GOING TO BE IN SUCH GOOD SHAPE.
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PLAY HIM POST WHAT HE HAS DONE.
Jon: IT'S ABOUT HEALTH. IF YOU ARE FEELING HEALTHY AND HE IS FEELING HEALTHY. I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE LOOK LIKE. ARE YOU FEELING HEALTHY?
I AM RATHER HANDSOME AS I LOSE WEIGHT.
Jon: YOU ARE HANDSOME -- FROM THE DAY I MET YOU. WE USED TO SIT IN -- WHAT IS IT? [LAUGHTER]
WHY DO YOU DO THIS EVERY TIME?  I KNOW I SHOULD'VE PREPARED. TELL ME ABOUT THE SHOW.
DON'T DO THAT. TELL ME ABOUT THE SHOW IS ALWAYS A  BAD QUESTION.
Jon: HERE IS WHAT WE USED TO. THERE WAS A PLACE 72ND STREET.
BJ'S BAGELS A-GO-GO.
Jon: A BAGEL PLACE WITH GO-GO GIRLS YOU WOULD THINK.
NO, YOU WOULD HOPE.
Jon: BUT THE TUNA THERE.
FANTASTIC.
Jon: WHAT WAS SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT.
IT WAS DELICIOUS. I DON'T KNOW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: NO (bleep). NO ONIONS AND CELERY AND CAPERS, NONE OF IT.
IT WAS JUST TUNA SALAD.
Jon: STRAIGHT UP, BABY. OLD SCHOOL. NO HIGH DEFINITION.
NO, IT WAS YOUR STANDARD DEFINITION TUNA AND I LIKED IT.
Jon: IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND WE WOULD SIT THERE FOR HOURS AND TALK ABOUT HOW JEFF ONE DAY WOULD BREAK THE BARRIER FOR JEWS ON TELEVISION.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IN ALL SINCERITY MY DREAM WAS TO BE ON A NETWORK SITCOM IN ORDER TO SOME DAY MAKE INDEPENDENT MOVIES. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. I MADE A MOVIE CALLED LAGGIES THAT I'M IN. I GOT PAID $8. I PLAYED KIERA KNIGHTLEY'S FATHER. I WAS DISTURBED BY THAT AND I ALSO DID A DOCUMENTARY CALLED FINDING VIVIENNE MEYER, A LADY WHO WAS A NANNY. I COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I MAKE NOTHING. BUT NOW I DO "THE GOLDBERGS" I MAKE A LOT!
Jon: THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS MAN BECAUSE FROM THE MOMENT I MET HIM NOT JUST A COMIC, AN ARTIST.
LET ME SAY THIS --
Jon: NO. I WILL SAY THIS THE GOLDBERGS -- [LAUGHTER] AIRS TUESDAY NIGHT IN BLACK AND WHITE AT 9:00 ON ABC JEFF GARLIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
