(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR AND ANCHOR OF PBS NEWSHOUR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED  "TENSION CITY: INSIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES FROM KENNEDY, NIXON TO OBAMA/  OBAMA/McCAIN." WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JIM LEHRER. SIR. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU? THE BOOK IS CALLED "TENSION CITY" AND HOW MUCH OF A DONATION  DO I HAVE TO MAKE TO GET THIS NCLUDED IN TOTE BAG FROM PBS?I
$25 IN PENNIES.
Jon: NICE. MAKE THEM COUNT IT. YOU HAVE MODERATED HOW MANY PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES?
11.
Jon: INCREDIBLE. WILL YOU... HAVE YOU SEEN IT SINCE WHEN YOU STARTED WHAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST CHANGE THAT  YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE EVOLUTION OF THESE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES?
WELL, THERE'S SOME FORMAT CHANGES. WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED YOU'D HAVE A MODERATOR AND YOU'D HAVE  THREE JOURNALIST PANELS AND NOW IT'S DOWN... WE'VE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL TRANSFORMATIONS. NOW WE'RE DOWN TO BASICALLY A SOLE MODERATOR FORMAT. ONE PERSON WITH ALL THE DINE MATE IN ONE PERSON'S HANDS.
Jon: RIGHT. AND NOW THEY DO THESE YOUTUBE DEBATES. PRETTY SOON THEY'LL JUST TAKE TWITTER QUESTIONS, NOBODY WILL EVEN BE THERE. (LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. THE OTHER BIG CHANGE WAS THE COMING OF THE "TOWN HALL" PUTTING PEOPLE IN AN AUDIENCE  AND A LOT OF... CHOSEN PEOPLE AND SOME OF THEM ARE NOT...
Jon: JUST JEWS? (LAUGHTER) THE CHOSEN PEOPLE.
A DIFFERENT CHOOSER. AND A DIFFERENT CHOOSER FOR EVERY DEBATE. LIKE THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT, THAT WAS... THOSE... THAT AUDIENCE WAS DRAWN FROM THE TEA PARTY MEMBERSHIP.
Jon: RIGHT.
LIKE THE ONE BEFORE THAT NBC DID AT SIMI VALLEY, IT WAS THE  REAGAN LIBRARY AND WAS CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT PART OF THE WORD AND WHO IN THAT PART  OF THE WORLD POLITICALLY.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THE NATIONALLY TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE RUN BY THE  COMMISSION AND THEY ARE... THERE'S STRICT RULES. THERE'S NO HOLLERING, NO SHOUTING, NONE OF THIS STUFF.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE IT'S ALL DONE FOR THE AUDIENCE, IT'S NOT DONE... I  MEAN FOR THE TELEVISION AUDIENCE, NOT FOR THE FOLKS THERE. THEY'RE NOT RALLIES.
Jon: WHAT ARE THE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE AMONGST THE CANDIDATES CAMPS? BECAUSE OFF STORY ABOUT HOW YOU GUYS... YOU WERE HAVING A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE, YOU DECIDED  ON THE FORMAT AND PETER JENNINGS SAID "I'VE GOTTEN A IDEA, LET'S  THROW CAUTION TO THE WIND AND MAKE THESE GUYS TALK TO EACH OTHER" AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE  "WE CAN'T DO THAT!"
WELL, MY... I HAD A VERY SELF-RIGHTEOUS VIEW OF THAT AND I TALKED PETER JENNINGS OUT OF  THAT ON THE GROUNDS THAT, LOOK, WE AGREED TO MODERATE UNDER THESE RULES AND I'VE GOTTEN A OBLIGATION. AND IF FOR SOME REASON THE CANDIDATES AND DEBATE COMMISSION AGREE LET'S HAVE A DEBATE WHERE  THERE ARE NO RULES, THAT'S FINE. AND WE'D DONE THAT A COUPLE TIMES. I DID ONE IN '92 WITH GEORGE H.W. BUSH, BILL CLINTON AND ROSS PEROT FOR 45 MINUTES, ONE HALF  OF A 90-MINUTE DEBATE WHERE IT WAS JUST ME AND THOSE THREE CANDIDATES WITH VERY FEW RULES, NO ONE MINUTE, TWO MINUTE, WHATEVER. THAT WAS SCARY. REALLY SCARY AND TU BUT EXHILARATING AND IT DID WORK. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WORKED WELL BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN TRIED AGAIN BECAUSE THE CANDIDATES AND THEIR  HANDLERS ARE AFRAID...
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE A RISK.
Jon: IN RETROSPECT, A LOT OF THE PARTICIPANTS TALK ABOUT  THE DEBATES, WHILE THEY DIDN'T LIKE THEM AND WHILE THEY HAD TO  MANAGE THEM, THEY FELT MADE THEM EITHER STRONGER CANDIDATES OR IN PRESIDENT CLINTON'S CASE A  STRONGER PRESIDENT. THEY FELT IT WAS AN EXERCISE IN THINKING ABOUT SCENARIOS YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY THINK ABOUT.
EXACTLY RIGHT. CLINTON FELT THAT VERY STRONGLY BECAUSE IT FORCED HIM... HE SAYS IT FORCES ALL THE CANDIDATES, OKAY, WHAT IS MY POSITION ON SOCIAL SECURITY OR ON WHETHER OR NOT... WHAT...
Jon: I LOVE THAT. I LOVE THAT. THEY'VE GOT A HANDLER AND THEY'RE LIKE "YES, TELL ME, WHAT IS MY POSITION ONS IS? BECAUSE WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT IN MY HEAD I SOUND INCOHERENT." (LAUGHTER)
WELL, BUT SEE WHAT HAPPENS, THEY SAY, OKAY, WELL, NOW WE'VE HEARD YOU SAY WHAT YOUR POSITION IS. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE THIRD RAIL POSITION  AND THEY'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S ALL THEY'LL TALK ABOUT. SO ROUND IT A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: THAT'S CHANGED A LOT. THE FIRST ONE YOU DEAL WITH NIXON/KENNEDY. AND THE REAL TAKEAWAY FROM NIXON/KENNEDY IS TELEVISION IS THE GAME CHANGER BECAUSE YOU  WRITE IN THERE NIXON HAD COME FROM THE HOSPITAL, DIDN'T WANT ANY MAKEUP KENNEDY HAD A  DISEASE, ADDISON'S DISEASE BUT THAT MADE HIM LOOK MORE TAN. SO HE GOES OUT THERE AND IF YOU WATCH IT ON TELEVISION THEY'RE  LIKE "OH, I LIKE THE CUT OF HIS JIB." IF YOU LISTEN TO IT ON RADIO  YOU'RE LIKE "THAT GUY GOT CREAMED."
EXACTLY. IT CHANGED EVERYTHING AND, IN FACT, NIXON HIMSELF SAID IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY I SPENT TOO MUCH  TIME WORRYING ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY AND NOT WHAT I LOOKED LIKE. AND I SAID IN THE BOOK AND I REALLY BELIEVE THIS THAT CANDIDATES WHO DON'T PAY  ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE OR WHAT THEY... THEIR BODY LANGUAGE AS WELL AS THEIR SPOKEN  LANGUAGE ARE MAKING A TERRIBLE MISTAKE BECAUSE PEOPLE WATCH THESE DEBATES. REMEMBER THESE NATIONALLY TELEVISED DEBATES AT THE END ARE USUALLY IN LATE SEPTEMBER, EARLY OCTOBER. 90% OR MORE OF THE FOLKS HAVE PRETTY MUCH MADE UP THEIR MIND FOR WHOM THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE  OR ARE LEANING AND SO WHAT EVERYBODY'S DOING IS TAKING THE MEASURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS  TO... CAN I SEE THIS PERSON SITTING BEHIND THE DESK IN THE OVAL OFFICE? HOW WOULD HE OR SHE REACT IF THERE WAS ANOTHER KATRINA AND ALL OF THAT? DO I LIKE THIS PERSON? AND YOU SEE THEM RIGHTING TO AND IT'S MORE ABOUT THAT...
Jon: IT'S JUST SUCH A... TELEVISION MAKES IT SUCH A FRIGHTENING PROPOSITION BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO IMAGINE THROUGHOUT  HISTORY LOSING GREAT LEADERS. PEOPLE ON TELEVISION GOING "YEAH, LINCOLN, NICE BEARD, NOT VOTING FOR HIM." (LAUGHTER)
THOMAS JEFFERSON SPOKE (VOICE UP HIGH) LIKE THIS.
Jon: JAMES MADISON YOU COULD HAVEN'T SEEN ABOVE THE PODIUM. THE GUY WAS LIKE 4 '10. HISTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT. "TENSION CITY." A FASCINATING LOOK BEHIND THE DEBATES FROM NIXON TO OBAMA. JIM LEHRER. THANK YOU SO MUCH. (CHEERS AND
