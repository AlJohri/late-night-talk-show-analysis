OCTOBER 4, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE GOT THE AUTHOR MICHAEL LEWIS WHO'S GOING TO BE ON THE PROGRAM. HE'S GOING TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK CALLED  "BOOMERANG" SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AND... OH, WOW! (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S NOT LIKE WE WORKED ON THAT FOR THREE HOURS. (LAUGHTER) LIKE "PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANNY." COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON  THIS, I DON'T KNOW WHY. REALLY? ALL RIGHT. GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, REPUBLICAN OF NEW JERSEY IN TRENTON, NEW JERSEY, TODAY AT 1:00 P.M. EASTERN (BLEEP) HOLE  TIME MAKING A STUNNING ANNOUNCEMENT.
.
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS FELT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION REMAINS THE RIGHT DECISION TODAY. NOW IS NOT MY TIME. THE ANSWER WAS NEVER ANYTHING BUT NO.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, CHRIS CHRISTIE 2012! CHRIS... WAIT. WHAT? (LAUGHTER) NO? OH. WELL, HAVING SAID HE WASN'T GOING TO RUN IN PRIVATE, HAVING SAID IT ON THE TELEVISION, HAVING SAID IT TO PRINT REPORTERS, HAVING TAGGED IT ON WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A  CONDEMNED TRENTON BUILDING... (LAUGHTER). HAVING DEMONSTRATED HIS POSITION WHILE ATTENDING A DEVILS GAME. (LAUGHTER) WHO PAYS FOR PRESEASON GAMES? IT'S OVER. FINALLY CHRISTIE COULD PROCEED WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE DEDICATED TO MORE PRESSING ISSUES.
WHAT I SAID WAS I'D RECONSIDER MY NO AND I DID. BUT THE NO NEVER CHANGED. I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE, IT'S NOT THERE. IT'S A NO. NO. BECAUSE I SAID NO. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS JOB. I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS MORNING AND TOLD THEM THE ANSWER IS NO. THAT'S NOT EVEN A RELEVANT QUESTION ANYMORE BECAUSE I'VE MADE THE DECISION NOT TO RUN. I KNOW IT'S YOUR GUYS JOB TO ASK ME THIS QUESTION A DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS AND I'LL ANSWER  IT ALMOST A DOZEN DIFFERENT WAYS. IN THE END, THE ANSWER REMAINS THE SAME AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
Jon: GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, OVER HERE, ONE QUESTION OVER HERE. I'M FROM THE "TRENTON WASN'T LISTENING TIMES" AND THE  SECAUCUS "CAN'T GET IT THROUGH MY (BLEEP)ING HEAD" MONTHLY. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2012? (LAUGHTER) WE'RE ONLY PIECING TOGETHER THAT AFTER CHRISTIE STATED HE WOULD NOT RUN. THE REPORTERS CONTINUED TO REPEATEDLY ASK HIM IF HE MIGHT RUN BECAUSE WE COULDN'T ACTUALLY  HEAR THEIR QUESTIONS. WE COULD ONLY GAUGE THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF THEIR QUESTIONS BY CHRISTIE'S ANSWERS. LET'S TRY ANOTHER ANSWER.
IT'S NOT A NEWS FLASH TO ME THAT I'M OVERWEIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I GUESS THE QUESTION THERE WAS "IS IT A NEWS FLASH TO  YOU THAT YOU'RE OVERWEIGHT?" (LAUGHTER) ACTUALLY THAT, QUESTION WAS  ABOUT WHETHER GOVERNOR CHRISTIE APPRECIATES THE MULTITUDE OF WEIGHT-BASE HUED MORTAR ON  TELEVISION PROGRAMS.
FOR ME THEIR JOB IS TO BE FUNNY AND IF ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO MAKE FUN OF IS MY  WEIGHT IT'S FAIR GAME. I'M A PUBLIC FIGURE. THEY CAN MAKE FUN OF IT. ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE FUNNY. SO THAT I CAN AT LEAST LAUGH ABOUT IT WHILE THEY'RE MOCKING ME, YOU KNOW? SOME OF THE STUFF I DIDN'T SEE INITIALLY AND MY SON WOULD GO  "DAD, DID YOU SEE THIS ONE?" SO HE'D BEEN GROUNDED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BOOM! NOW THAT'S A JERSEY GUY. I GOT TO SAY, I LIKE THIS GUY, HE'S A STRAIGHT TALKER, DOESN'T SPEAK IN TALKING POINTS. HE'S AUTHENTIC. HE SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD HE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN JUST A LITTLE BIT. SO AS REPUBLICANS ABSORB THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CHRISTIE IS REALLY, TRULY, UNEQUIVOCALLY  PROBABLY NOT RUNNING AND REPUBLICANS CONTINUE CHECKING UNDERNEATH EVERY AVAILABLE FLAG  PIN AND BIBLE FOR VIABLE CANDIDATES, PRESUME DEFACTO FRONT-RUNNER CANDIDATE MITT  ROMNEY'S GOT TO BE THINKING WHAT THE FUDGE? (LAUGHTER) THIS IS STARTING TO HURT WHERE MY FEELINGS SHOULD BE. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, ROMNEY HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ... SINCE 2007! ROMNEY'S THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE THE ACTUAL TEA PARTY HAPPENED. HE'S THE SON OF A POPULAR MIDWESTERN GOVERNOR. HE'S RICH. HE LOOKS LIKE A GUY YOU'D CAST AS THE PRESIDENT IN A MOVIE. AND NOT A MOVIE WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS CORRUPT OR AN ASTEROID IS ABOUT TO HIT THE  EARTH BUT MORE OF A LIGHT HEARTED PRESIDENT DAD TYPE MOVIE. (LAUGHTER) WHERE HE COMMANDS AN ARMY BUT CAN'T CONNECT WITH HIS KIDS. I MEAN, THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO MITT ROMNEY WINNING NEXT YEAR'S REPUBLICAN NOMINATION IS THAT UP  UNTIL VERY, VERY RECENTLY THEY WAS ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING REPUBLICANS SAND FOR.
LOOK, I WAS AN INDEPENDENT DURING THE TIME OF REAGAN/BUSH. I'M NOT TRYING TO RETURN TO REAGAN/BUSH. I DO NOT TAKE THE POSITION OF A PRO-LIFE CANDIDATE. I'M IN FAVOR OF PRESERVING AND PROTECTING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE.
Jon: TO BE FAIR TO ROMNEY, AT THAT TIME HE DID BELIEVE VERY DEEPLY IN HIS HEART THAT HE WANTED TO BE ELECTED GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS. (LAUGHTER) BUT NOW IT'S 2011. HE'S NOT AN IRRESPONSIBLE KID IN HIS MID-50s ANYMORE. HE'S MATURED AND LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON ABOUT WANTING TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT. YES, MITT ROMNEY HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM, AND THAT'S THE WIN TO REPUBLICAN NOMINATION HE  HAS TO CONVINCE REPUBLICAN VOTERS HE'S NOT ACTUALLY MITT ROMNEY.
MY VIEW IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD REVERSE "ROE V. WADE."
WOULD YOU HAVE SUPPORTED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED THE  DEFINITION OF LIFE AT CONCEPTION?
ABSOLUTELY. I AM PRO-LIFE. > Jon: I'M IF PRO LIFE AS IN.> "HEY, I LIED BEFORE. THAT'S LIFE." (LAUGHTER) HOW HARD WILL HIS PAST BE? HERE'S ROMNEY'S 2003 STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS IN WHICH HE  PROMISED "WE'LL PLUG CORPORATE TAX LOON HOLES TO COMPANIES WILL  PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE." UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T HAVE THAT QUOTE ON VIDEO. BUT WE FOUND A NEARLY IDENTICAL SENTIMENT.
LET'S CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES, LET'S ELIMINATE THOSE TAX BREAKS AND LET'S MAKE SURE THAT  EVERYBODY'S PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I CAN'T BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY'S A SOCIALIST MUSLIM KENYAN! (LAUGHTER)
IN MINUTE, A LOOPHOLE IS WHEN SOMEONE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A TAX  LAW IN A WAY THAT WASN'T INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATION. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO USE THE WORD LOOPHOLE TO SAY "LET'S JUST RAISE TAXES ON  PEOPLE" AND THAT I WILL NOT DO. I WILL NOT RAISE TAXES.
Jon: HOLY BLOOP, I THINK HE FOUND A LOOPHOLE TO GET AROUND THE WORD LOOPHOLE. AND NOT ONLY DOES ROMNEY HAVE TO DISAVOW HIS POSITION, AS FORMER GOVERNOR AND VETERAN OF TWO  OTHER UNSUCCESSFUL POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR SENATE AND PRESIDENT ALSO HAS TO DISAVOW  HIS CHOSEN VOCATION.
I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU WOULD TELL MY CLASS THAT WOULD MAKE US WANT TO BE POLITICIANS.
SHE WOULD ASK ME WHAT I WOULD TELL HER CLASSMATES TO ENCOURAGE  THEM TO BECOME A POLITICIAN. AND THE ANSWER IS NOTHING. DON'T DO IT. RUN. RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN.
Jon: RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN. YOU SEE, I'M NO GOOD, KID. (LAUGHTER) I'M A BAD MAN. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE ME. (LAUGHTER) POLITICS IS DIRTY. ACTUALLY, ROMNEY'S JUST TELLING THOSE KIDS NOT TO GO INTO POLITICS BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF  THEY DID THEY WOULD BE THE NEW REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNERS. (LAUGHTER) SEE, ROMNEY'S NOT A MODERATE, ROMNEY'S NOT A MODERATE PRO-CHOICE WEALTH REDISTRIBUTING CORPORATE LOOPHOLE CLOSING  CAREER POLITICIAN. HE'S A TEA PARTY PRO-LIFE OUTSIDER. AND THERE'S ONE OTHER THING THIS QUARTER OF A BILLIONAIRE WANTS  YOU TO KNOW BEFORE YOU VOTE FOR HIM.
WE OUGHT TO PROVIDE HOPE THE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT MOST BY THE OBAMA ECONOMY AND  THAT'S THE MIDDLE-CLASS. IT'S FOR THE GREAT MIDDLE-CLASS. THE 80% TO 90% OF US IN THIS COUNTRY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: WHO YOU CALLING "US"? I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO... THE TRANSFORMATION IS COMPLETE. WHERE IN THE WORLD, MITT ROMNEY, ARE YOU MIDDLE-CLASS? YOU'RE NOT MIDDLE-CLASS AT A REUNION OF YOUR HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL COLLEAGUES. YOU WOULDN'T BE MIDDLE-CLASS AT AN OPEC MEETING. (LAUGHTER) BUT I GUESS IT'S NICE TO KNOW EVEN IF REPUBLICAN VOTERS KNOW  WHO THE REAL MITT ROMNEY IS, MITT ROMNEY DOESN'T. (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
