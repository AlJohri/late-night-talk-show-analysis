MY GUEST, THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK, KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND IS GOING TO BE JOINING US RIGHT HERE ON THE PROGRAM TALKING ABOUT HER NEW BOOK. WE...OH, LOOK HOW TIRED LITTLE JONNY IS! LITTLE JONNY IS SO TIRED! YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED WE DIDN'T DO A SHOW LAST NIGHT THERE. I WAS AT THE TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL WITH OUR FILM ROSEWATER. AND THE WEEK BEFORE THAT WE WERE IN THE TELLURIDE FILM FESTIVAL. AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK BOTH OF THOSE FESTIVALS FOR GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY AND SUCH A WARM RECEPTION AND IT WAS REALLY LOVELY AND GREATLY APPRECIATED AND EXCITING AND THANK YOU AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SLEPT. ANYWAY, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GET BACK TO THE OLD U.S. OF A. WHAT DID I MISS?
GOOD MORNING, ARE WE BACK AT WAR? (LAUGHTER)

THE U.S. WILL INCREASE ITS OFFENSIVE TO DESTROY ISIS.
ISIS, OF COURSE, THE ISLAMIST GROUP THAT HAS TAKEN OVER CHUNKS OF IRAQ AND SYRIA.
ITS END GOAL IS TO CREATE A MUSLIM CALIPHATE.
THE CONTINUOUS, ONE PERSON LED GOVERNMENT THAT EXPANDS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OVER THE WORLD.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS WRONG WITH THESE GUYS? STORM INTO A COUNTRY LIKE IRAQ, UNINVITED AND DESTROY THE PLACE IN THE NAME OF IMPLEMENTING YOUR FAVORITE SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE? THESE PEOPLE AREN'T JUST TERRORISTS. THEY'RE PLAGIARISTS!  (LAUGHTER) WELL, IF WE'RE GOING TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ AGAIN, IF WE'RE GOING TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ AGAIN, IF WE ARE GOING TO GO TO WAR IN IRAQ AGAIN, WE'RE GOT TO GET US ONE OF THEM, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, WHAT DID WE HAVE LAST TIME, ONE OF THEM COALITIONS OF THE WILLING. WHO'S GONNA STAND WITH THEIR OLD PAL AMERICA THIS TIME?
THE UK, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, DENMARK, TURKEY, POLAND,CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA.
Jon: WE GOT THE BAND BACK TOGETHER! BOOM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S LIKE WHEN WUTANG REUNITED! I MEAN, THAT'S EVERYBODY! ANY NEWCOMERS?
IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER HAS SIGNED OFF ON A PLAN TO COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED STATES TO CONFRONT THE THREAT OF ISIS.
Jon: THAT'S A WEIRD ONE. (LAUGHTER) WOW. ISIS IS SO BAD THAT MORTAL ENEMIES ARE NOW JOINING TOGETHER. IT'S LIKE THAT TIME WHEN EDWARD SCISSORHAND TEAMED UP WITH FLAT STANLEY -- (LAUGHTER) -- TO -- TO DEFEAT -- LET'S SAY SMALLPOX. THEY DEFEATED SMALL BOX. THERE YOU GO. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. FLAT STANLEY, OF COURSE, MADE OF PAPER. ALL RIGHT. SO WE KNOW OUR COALITION -- WHO ARE WE FIGHTING? WHO'S ON THE ISIS SIDE?
ALL OF THE KURDS HATE ISIS, ALL OF THE SHIA ARABS HATE ISIS, THE SUNNI ARABS WOULD LOVETO BE RID OF THESE GUYS. ISRAEL AND ARABS, CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND JEWS, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE SYRIAN REBELS ARE ALL GOING AFTER THEM.
Jon: BUT, YOU KNOW, DEEP DOWN, WHO HATES ISIS THE MOST? ISIS. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S WHY THEY ACT OUT. YOU KNOW, IT'S GOTTEN SO BAD THERE'S ACTUALLY NOW AN ANTI-ISIS VIRAL VIDEO CAMPAIGN.
LEBANESE TEENAGERS IGNITING ANTI-TERROR INTERNET SENSATION. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS? WE'LL THEY'RE URGING PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD TO BURN ISIS FLAGS.
TWITTER USERS IN LEBANON QUICKLY MODELED THE FLAG BURNING CAMPAIGN TO THE ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE.
Jon: FIRST YOU GOT THESE ICE WATER CAMPAIGNS.  NOW ARSON. THESE FACEBOOK MEMES ARE GETTING VERY DANGEROUS. YOU KNOW, WHEN'S IT GOING TO... AND NOW TO END WORLD HUNGER THE PUT-FIREWORKS-IN-YOUR-ASS-AND- JUMP-IN-A-LIVE-VOLCANO CHALLENGE! YOU KNOW. IT'S GETTING DANGEROUS! (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THAT IS NOT PHOTOSHOPED. THAT IS A NAKED MAN WITH A ROMAN CANDLE IN HIS ASS PROPELLING HIMSELF TOWARDS WHAT APPEARS TO BE MOLTEN LAVA. (LAUGHTER) AND WE TOOK A PICTURE OF IT. (LAUGHTER) AND SHOWED IT TO YOU. YOU MAY LAUGH. BUT IT'S NO JOKE TO THAT MAN'S PUBIC HAIR. THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET SINGED. WITH ALL THIS ISIS TALK, ISN'T THERE, ISN'T THERE SOMEONE WE'RE FORGETTING?
AL QAEDA HAS RECENTLY BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE.
ISIS HAS BEEN DOMINATING THE NEWS.
THESE KIND OF HOLLYWOOD ALMOST STYLE PRODUCTIONS SEPARATES THEM FROM A GROUP LIKE AL QAEDA.
SOCIAL MEDIA, THIS IS WHERE ISIS FAR SURPASSES EVERY OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
AL QAEDA IS LIKE GUNS AND A FEW BOMBS. THESE GUYS HAVE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, THEY HAVE SHOULDER LAUNCH MISSILES, THEY HAVE TANKS.
AND NOW THEY'VE SORT OF TAKEN THE WORLD STAGE AND EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THEM, AND NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT AL QAEDA.
Jon: AL QAEDA, SO, THEY'RE SO OVER, THEY'RE SO DONE! THEY'RE SO, WHATEVER, I DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT, IT'S LIKE, JUSTIN BIEBER AND ISIS HAVE LIKE WHATEVER, I DON'T CARE. AL QAEDA USED TO BE LIKE I HAVE THEIR PICTURES UP, BUT NOW I THINK THEY'RE JUST LIKE SO STUPID. I GOTTA TELL YOU, THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL TO AL QAEDA. WITH THESE REPORTS, THESE ISIS VIDEOS, WHERE DO YOU THINK THE AMBITIOUS YOUNG TERROR TALENT IS GOING TO GO? IT'S TIME TO STEP UP AL QAEDA, AND SHOW EVERYONE YOU'RE STILL RELEVANT IN TODAY'S FEAR MARKET.
AL QAEDA IS ALSO ON THE MOVE. THE GROUP HAS ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A WING IN INDIA.
Jon: WHAT THE -- WHAT IS THAT? ISIS IS CUTTING A VAST SWATH THROUGH THE MIDDLE EAST, SETTING UP A NEW FUNDAMENTALIST BRUTAL CALIPHATE AND YOUR RESPONSE AL QAEDA IS, HEY, EVERYBODY, GUESS WHO HAS TWO THUMBS AND JUST LEASED SOME OFFICE SPACE IN BANGALORE? (LAUGHTER) WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A CLASSIC COKE V. PEPSI SITUATION. TWO GLOBALLY-RECOGNIZED BRANDS COMPETING FOR THE SAME KEY DEMOGRAPHIC: MEN, 18 TO 24 WHO DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT MAKING IT TO THAT NEXT DEMOGRAPHIC. (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT CAN AL QAEDA DO? YOU'VE STILL GOT HUGE BRAND RECOGNITION, AL QAEDA. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOUR NAME  OUT THERE IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. YEAH -- THAT'S WHAT I'M -- NO -- (LAUGHTER) YEAH, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT SURE YOU WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHING AS DISREPUTABLE AS PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER) BUT I TELL YOU WHAT -- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT COULD WORK. OH, WHAT? OH, NO, HE DID NOT SAY THAT ABOUT PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL! (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS THIS, ISIS IS OUT AL QAEDA-ING AL QAEDA. THEY'RE FASTER, THEY'RE MEANER, THEY'VE GOT BETTER PRODUCTION VALUES. I THINK IT'S TIME AL QAEDA JUST EMBRACED THEIR FLAWS, SPIN THEM AS STRENGTHS. AL QAEDA, YOU'RE NOT OLD FASHIONED WITH THE CAVES AND THE VHS TAPES! YOU'RE AN ARTISNAL, SLOW TERROR, BOMB-TO TABLE ORGANIZATION! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
