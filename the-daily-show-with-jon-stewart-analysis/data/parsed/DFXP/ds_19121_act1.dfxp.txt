FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. FROM THE MOVIE "THINK LIKE A MAN TOO," "THINK LIKE A MAN TOO," THE GREAT, THE HILARIOUS KEVIN HART IS GONNA BE JOINING US A LITTLE BIT LATER. BUT OUR TOP STORY, WE HAVE A BIG STORY, THERE IS BIG NEWS OUT OF LIBYA.
THE U.S. HAS CAPTURED THE SUSPECTED RINGLEADER OF THE ATTACK IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA.
DELTA FORCE COMMANDOS WITH DRONES OVERHEAD GRABBED ABU KHATTALA, WHISKING HIM OFF TO A NAVY WARSHIP.
U.S. INTELLIGENCE TRACKED HIM TO SMALL SEASIDE VILLA SOUTH OF BENGHAZI AND QUICKLY CAPTURED KHATTALA WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT. NO ONE WAS HURT.
Jon: NO SHOTS, NO WOUNDS, NO ERRORS. THE COMMANDOS EVEN SPRUCED UP THE VILLA A LITTLE BIT FOR THE NEXT AIR B&B GUESTS, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS VERY NICE. GREAT NEWS ALL AROUND, WELL-PLANNED OPERATION, EXECUTED FLAWLESSLY, TERRORISTS CAPTURED WITH NO CASUALTIES. CANNOT FIND A SINGLE THING WRONG, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY I DON'T WORK AT FOX.
WHAT TOOK THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SO LONG TO CAPTURE ABU KHATTALA?
641 DAYS AFTER THE PRESIDENT VOWED TO BRING THE KILLERS TO JUSTICE.
Jon: OH FOR GOD'S SAKE, OBAMA GOT THE GUY THAT YOU HAD BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT HE HADN'T GOTTEN YET. IT'S YOUR WHITE WHALE. WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH MOBY DICKS ABOUT THIS. OH, MELVILLE, WHY DID YOU NAME YOUR SYMBOL OF EVIL IN A MODERN WORLD AFTER A SYNONYM FOR A PENIS? HOW EASY DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR US TO GET HIM?
KHATTALA HAD BEEN LIVING IN PLAIN SIGHT.
HE ALWAYS MET WITH JOURNALISTS IN PUBLIC AND FAVORED SIPPING LATTES AT A LOCAL HOTEL IN BENGHAZI.
SITTING OUTSIDE OF A LUXURY HOTEL, SIPPING A STRAWBERRY FRAPPE.
HE WAS SIPPING MANGO JUICE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOW DOES THIS GUY HAVE TIME TO PLAN ATTACKS WITH ALL THE URINATING HE MUST BE DOING? "MY FRIENDS, WE WILL COME IN FROM THE NORTH. OUR GLORIOUS FORCES WILL -- CAN YOU EXCUSE ME FOR JUST ONE MOMENT? I HAVE TO USE THE LITTLE TERRORIST'S ROOM." I GUESS WE COULD HAVE CAPTURED HIM SOONER. ALL RIGHT, FOX, DO YOU HAVE ANY STUPIDER COMPLAINTS? MAYBE DELIVERED WITH A WEIRD SENSE OF SUPERIORITY AND SECRET KNOWLEDGE?
NOW, ISN'T THAT CURIOUS TIMING, THE SAME DAY THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS SHOWING UP ON FOX NEWS, THEY ARE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE WE GOT THE BAD GUY.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, NO, THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND FOX. NORMALLY TO FIND THAT LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATED UNDERSTANDING OF CAUSALITY, YOU WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO A TWO-YEAR-OLD.
I PICKED UP A BALL AND IT STARTED TO RAIN. [LAUGHTER] I CONTROL THE SKY. [LAUGHTER] BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME FOX FOR HAVING HILLARY ON THE BRAIN. THEY PLANNED THEIR ENTIRE DAY AROUND HER.
A MUST-SEE INTERVIEW LATER TONIGHT HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL WITH HILLARY CLINTON.
DO NOT FORGET, TOMORROW HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE HERE.
HARD-HITTING, STRAIGHTFORWARD INTERVIEW WITH HILLARY CLINTON.
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW.
A FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE.
Jon: A FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE YOU WILL NOT SEE HILLARY CLINTON ANYWHERE ELSE.
THE CNN TOWN HALL EXCLUSIVE. HILLARY CLINTON'S HARD CHOICES.
BIG QUESTIONS ASKED IN TONIGHT'S CNN TOWN HALL.
WE ARE LESS THAN THREE HOURS AWAY...
FROM AN EXCLUSIVE TOWN HALL.
AN EXCLUSIVE TOWN HALL.
THE ONLY NETWORK TELEVISED TOWN HALL MEETING.
Jon: WOW, IMAGINE THAT, TWO NEWS NETWORKS EXPRESSLY PROMOTING EXCLUSIVES WITH HILLARY CLINTON ON THE SAME DAY. IT'S LIKE WORDS HAVE NO MEANING ANYMORE. [LAUGHTER] BUT GOOD GET. THEY SHOULD PROUD OF THEMSELVES FOR SECURING AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW FROM THE SALLINGER-LIKE RECLUSE HILLARY CLINTON, A WOMAN WHOSE SECRETIVE NATION-WIDE BOOK TOUR HAD RESTRICTED HER ACCESS TO NBC, CBS, ABC TWICE AND THE ARLINGTON VIRGINIA COSTCO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, FOR $12, AS YOU CAN SEE THERE AT THE COSTCO, FOR JUST $12, YOU GET 400 COPIES OF HER BOOK AND HER. BUT ALL RIGHT. FOX'S EXCLUSIVE SHOWS THE MENAGE A TROI FORMAT KNOWN ON CERTAIN WEB SITES AS TWO ANCHORS, ONE CLINTON. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THIS WAS GOING TO BE HARDER TO WATCH.
WE'RE PLEASED TO WELCOME TO OUR SET, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE, MADAM SECRETARY.
THANK YOU BOTH.
SECRETARY CLINTON, THANK YOU. I READ THE BOOK. OF COURSE, I TRAVELED ON MANY OF THESE TRIPS, SO A FUN READ. THANK YOU.
I WANT TO BE FAIR AND BALANCED TO GRETA HERE.
THAT IS VERY FAIR. I LIKE THAT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WHAT'S WITH ALL THE HA, HA, HA AND FUN READ. GUYS, THIS IS THE WOMAN WHO SNUCK INTO THE EMBASSY IN BENGHAZI TO PERSONALLY STRANGLE FOUR AMERICANS AND A BALD EAGLE. BIG LETDOWN, FOX. BIG! WELL, LET'S HOPE CNN DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE BY OVER-HYPING THEIR EXCLUSIVE.
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES AS WE GET READY FOR THIS EVENT.
WE'RE PUTTING FINISHING TOUCHES HERE ON THE SET. CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR WILL BE SITTING RIGHT HERE. HILLARY CLINTON, SHE WILL BE SITTING RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE HOT SEAT.
Jon: HONEY, GET IN HERE. HONEY! HONEY, GET IN HERE, THEY'RE INTRODUCING THE CHAIRS. HONEY! YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT. HURRY UP. THEY'RE INTRODUCING... YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO TAPE IT? WELL, I'M SURE THE INTERVIEW LIVED UP TO THE HYPE AND WAS NOT IN ANY WAY A ONE-HOUR INFOMERCIAL FOR WHATEVER IT IS HER BOOK IS CALLED.
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES DO MILITARY GO IN WITH IRAN, THAT'S A HARD CHOICE, BUT SHOULD THEY DO THAT?
IT'S A VERY HARD CHOICE. I WRITE A WHOLE CHAPTER ABOUT SYRIA IN MY BOOK "HARD CHOICES." THESE ARE DIFFICULT, HARD CHOICES. WE MAKE HARD CHOICES. HARD CHOICES, HARD CHOICES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL I CAN SAY IS IT'S A GOOD THING SHE DIDN'T NAME HER BOOK "ULTIMATE [BLEEPED] STORM." [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, CHRISTIANE, THIS IS HOW WE FOUND OURSELVES IN AN ULTIMATE [BLEEPED] STORM. SO FOX AND CNN BOTH HAD EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH HILLARY CLINTON ON THE SAME NIGHT, YET JUST AN HOUR APART FROM EACH OTHER. I WONDER HOW THE INTERVIEWS WENT.
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR DID AN EXCELLENT JOB MODERATING THE TOWN HALL MEETING.
BRET BAIER ASKED HER A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SHOULD HAVE ASKED HER. IT WAS A FANTASTIC INTERVIEW.
A VERY SUCCESSFUL, VERY INTERESTING.
CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR IS ONE OF THE BEST.
BRET BAIER DID REALLY GOOD JOB.
REALY A FASCINATING HOUR-LONG TOWN MEETING.
GREAT TO WATCH.
EXCELLENT TOWN HALL MEETING.
TERRIFIC WORK.
GREAT JOB.
OUTSTANDING JOB.
Jon: YOU KNOW, BOTH INTERVIEWS REALLY WERE THE ULTIMATE [BLEEPED]. BACK TO YOU, BRET. OF COURSE, CNN WASN'T SATISFIED WITH THEIR EXCLUSIVE HILLARY CLINTON TOWN HALL. THEY HELD AN EXCLUSIVE AFTER TOWN HALL, RETROSPECTIVE TRIBUTE TO THEIR PREVIOUS TOWN HALL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? DID SHE DO A GOOD JOB OR DIDN'T SHE DO A GOOD JOB. WHAT DO YOU THINK? GOOD JOB? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I THINK THEY THINK SHE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB. THE ANCHOR OF "THE LEAD" JAKE TAPPER'S GOT SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE JUST HEARD. NICE ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR JAKE.
CHRISTIANE DID A FANTASTIC JOB. WE SHOULD GIVE APPLAUSE TO CHRISTIANE.
LET'S GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR MODERATOR CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR. SHE'S HERE WITH US AS WELL. YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB, CHRISTIANE. GIVE ME A KISS. BEAUTIFUL JOB. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SORRY, I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT, CNN, FROM NOW ON I'M JUST GOING TO CALL YOUR NETWORK RON JEREMY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY NEWS NETWORK THAT CAN BLOW ITSELF. BUT NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU DID A GOOD JOB. YOU DID A GOOD JOB. IN FACT, WE HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW," YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB, WE ALL CHIPPED IN AND GOT YOU SOMETHING AS A REWARD. IT'S, OH HATE TO EVEN DO IT, IT'S THE MISSING PLANE FROM MALAYSIA. HERE IT IS. IT'S FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU GUYS REALLY WANTED ONE. YOU'VE BEEN DROPPING HINTS. HAPPY EXCLUSIVE. OH, NO, I BROKE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S HEAR IT FOR THAT JOKE, EVERYBODY? AM I RIGHT? GREAT WORK FOR THAT JOKE. HOW ABOUT A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE PROP GUYS. DON'T FORGET ME, A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE BEST JOKE. HEY, WHO [BLEEPED]. SON OF A BITCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
