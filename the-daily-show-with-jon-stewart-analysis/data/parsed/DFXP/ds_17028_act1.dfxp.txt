DECEMBER 1st, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TWOUR TONIGHT. JOINING ME TONIGHT GREAT BOB COSTAS TALKING A LITTLE BIT OF SMACK ABOUT BRIAN WILLIAM, MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. KIDDING CAN OF COURSE. LET'S BEGIN WITH A NEW SEGMENT. WE BASE IT ON THE FACT THAT NO ONE HAS YET BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE 2008  FINANCIAL CRISIS, IT'S A NEW SEGMENT WE CALL HOW THE  [BLEEP] IS IT THAT MARTHA STEWART WENT TO JAIL? (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET INTO IT. WE ALL REMEMBER THE INFAMOUS BANK BAILOUT, TARP, TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM AND BY  ASSETS I MEAN LIABILITIES AND BY TROUBLED I MEAN WORTHLESS. IT WAS AN ENORMOUS WALL STREET BAILOUT THAT EVERYBODY AGREED WE HAD TO DO AND SHOULDN'T DO IT.
REMEMBER TARP, REMEMBER THE BAILOUTS, MAIN STREET DIDN'T GET BAILED OUT BUT  THE RICH GUYS ON WALL STREET DID.
$700 BILLION THROWN TOGETHER OVER A WEEKEND.
$780 WORTH OF TARP.
TARPS WITH A BAILOUT FUND THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
TARP IS THE MOST HATED PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN RECENT AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: OH! ALL, ALL OF AMERICA, EVEN MORE HATED THAN THE MANDATORY SASPARILLA ENEMA ACT OF 1908. (LAUGHTER) THE SECRET INGREDIENT, SASPARILLA. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, $700 BILLION WAS HOW MUCH THE SYSTEM NEEDED TO AVOID COLLAPSE. AND HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT $700 BILLION, THE PUBLIC KNEW ABOUT T BUT YOU  KNOW THERE WAS THIS OTHER SLIGHT MORE SECRETIVE PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH THE FEDERAL RESERVE FUNNELED  MONEY NOT BANKS. I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY WAY WE COULD GET A DOLLAR AMOUNT ON THAT PROGRAM. AND WHILE WE RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION, I'M JUST GOING TO SIT HERE, CALMLY HOLDING  THIS PENCIL TWIX MY FINGERS LIKE SO.
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE DATA NOW ON HOW MUCH MONEY THE U.S. FEDERAL  RESERVE, THE CENTRAL BANK, DOLLED OUT TO U.S. BANKS AND THE NUMBER, TOTAL SUPPORT $7.7 TRILLION U.S. DOLLARS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I KNOW THIS DIDN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH BUT I AM AN OLDER MAN. (LAUGHTER) AND THIS IS, THAT CRACK YOU HEARD WAS ACTUALLY MY THUMBS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR BONE DENSITY IS LESS THAN A PENCIL. ALL RIGHT, $7.7 TRILLION DOLLARS, THAT'S TARP, THE WORST PROGRAM IN U.S. HISTORY TIMES 11. IT'S HARD TO VISUALIZE SO WITH MOST THINGS I TURN TO STAR WARS. THAT'S TARP, THAT'S TARP, THAT IS TARP. HERE'S THIS OTHER [BLEEP] PROGRAM. (LAUGHTER) 1 TRILLION, 2 TRILLION, 4 TRILLION, THERE'S THE CAFETERIA, 6 TRILLION-- 7.7 TRILLION. (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, THE NUMBERS I WAS SAYING WAS JUST HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO PAY LUCAS FOR  THAT CLIP. SO THANK YOU TO BLOOMBERG NEWS FOR FINDING THAT OUT. NOW WE KNOW WE ULTIMATELY SENT THE BANKS $7.7 TRILLION. THAT'S MORE THAN HALF OF THE COUNTRY'S ENTIRE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. IT'S MORE THAN TWICE THE ANNUAL BUDGET OF THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, OBVIOUSLY NOT COUNTING THAT 7.7 TRILLION EXPENDITURE. WHERE DID THEY COME UP WITH THE MONEY?
THE FEDERAL RESERVE CREATED OUT OF THIN AIR AND LOANED AT BELOW MARKET RATES  7.7 TRILLION DOLLARS.
Jon: HUH? WHAT? BELOW-- HOW FAR BELOW MARKET ARE WE TALKING HERE AND WHILE YOU ANSWER, I WILL-- EVER  SO GENTLY HOLD THIS LUMP OF COAL.
THEY LENT OUT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT AN INTEREST RATE OF 0.01%.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP]! 0.01%! CHIRBS PLAUS (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU, 0.01%, THAT'S NOT BELOW MARKET, THAT'S FREE. WHERE DOES ONE GO TO GET ONE OF THESE FREE LOANS YOU SPEAK OF.
THEY PUMPED $7 TRILLION IN INTO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED A  DISCOUNT WINDOW.
Jon: OH, A DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHERE THEY JUST HAND OUT INTEREST FREE MONEY. QUICK QUESTION WHERE IS THIS WINDOW? BECAUSE WHEN GI TO THE BANK FOR SOME REASON I HAVE TO USE THE INEXPLICABLE FEE WINDOW. (LAUGHTER) WHAT WAS WALL STREET DOING WITH THIS 7.7 GAJILLION IN 0 INTEREST THIN AIR TAXPAYER MONEY. AND TO ENSURE THAT I DON'T GET UP SET ABOUT THE INFORMATION I'M ABOUT TO  HEAR, I'M GOING TO TAKE MY BIGGEST THERAPEUTIC STEP YET AND SEE HOW-- I'M JUST GOING  TO, WHILE I HEAR THIS INFORMATION, I'M JUST GOING HOLD PROFESSOR BUTTERSCOTCH  HERE AND-- YEAH, YEAH. PROFESSOR BUTTERSCOTCH, HE CALMS ME SO I WILL HOLD HIM WHILE I HEAR IT.
IF YOU ARE A BANK YOU CAN BORROW MONEY FOR FREE FROM THE FED AT 0 AND REINVEST IT  IN TREASURY AND PAY 3%.
THE BANKS PROBABLY PROFITED ABOUT $13 BILLION.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP]! NO! OH, OH, OH. PROFESSOR BUTTERSCOTCH, WHAT I HAVE DONE? PROFESSOR BUTTERSCOTCH, AND HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET TENURE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AN ACTUAL PROFESSOR. SO LET'S REITERATE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE. BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT WAS LENDING BANKS MONEY AT NO INTEREST, AND THEN BORROWING  IT BACK FROM THE BANKS AT INTEREST. OUR GOVERNMENT IS THE WORLD'S DUMBEST LOAN SHARK. (LAUGHTER) THE GOVERNMENT WAS SELLING DOLLAR BILLS TO THE BANKS FOR 97 CENTS. AND THE BANKS HAD THE BALLS TO BONUS THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR BEING SMART ENOUGH TO GO, OKAY. SO BANKS, A PERPETUAL MONEY MACHINE. TO BE FAIR, ACCORDING TO FURTHER BLOOMBERG RESEARCH, THE INTEREST BANKS EARNED DURING THAT TREASURY DEAL WHILE THEY WERE GETTING FREE  LOANS FROM THE FED ONLY ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 10 OF THE 13 BILLION IN BAILOUT RELATED PROFITS. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, THANK GOD AT LEAST THE FED TOLD CONGRESS ABOUT THE SIZE OF  THIS SCHEME, THE 7.7 TRILLION SO, IT COULD ADDRESS THE REAL SCOPE OF OUR SYSTEMIC FINANCIAL  PROBLEMS WITH THE DODD FRANK FINANCIAL REFORM LAW.
IT ALSO KEPT THIS INFORMATION SECRET FROM TREASURY DURING THE TIME  THAT THEY WERE CREATING TARP, AND THEY KEPT IT SECRET FROM CONGRESS WHEN CONGRESS WAS DOING THE DODD FRANK FINANCIAL REFORM LAW.
Jon: AND THAT CONCLUDES THIS INSTALLMENT OF, HOW THE  [BLEEP] IS IT THAT MARTHA STEWART WENT TO JAIL? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
