Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS "GANDHI BEFORE INDIA," PLEASE WELCOME RAMACHANDRA GUHA. HELLO, SIR. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NICE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS -- HERE IS WHAT I LOVE. THIS IS THE BOOK, GANDHI BEFORE INDIA. WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH AN ICONIC FIGURE, A FIGURE THAT BELONGS TO THE AGES, TO BRING A PERSPECTIVE TO IT THAT IS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN TO MANY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THEY KNOW HIM WELL. I BELIEVE I KNOW GANDHI, YOU SAY GANDHI I HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS I THINK I KNOW.
YES.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.  THIS IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO READ ABOUT HIM IN HIS YOUNGER LIFE.
YES. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT, JON, NEVER TO TRUST YOUR SUBJECT'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY. YOU KNOW, EVEN A GUY AS FAMOUS AS GANDHI, I MEAN YOU WRITE YOUR MEMOIRS?
Jon: WHAT?
YOUR BIOGRAPHER WOULD SAY, THIS IS A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE AGAINST ME. YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP IT.
Jon: I SEE.
NOW, GANDHI HAS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS LIFE, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT GANDHI'S LIFE BASED ON GANDHI'S WRITINGS. BUT WHAT I TRIED TO DO WAS TO LOOK AT PERSPECTIVES THAT GO BEYOND HIM, WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT HIM, IN SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE THE WHITE NEWSPAPERS, NOT -- IN A NOT DISSIMILAR MANNER TO THE NEVADA NEWSPAPERS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, WROTE VERY VICIOUS THINGS ABOUT HIM. YOU KNOW, SATIRICAL FUNNY POEMS. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE HIS FRIENDS, HIS RIVALS. SO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING AMOUNT GANDHI, LETTERS, DOCUMENTS CAN ILLUMINATE HIS LIFE, HIS EARLY FORMATION, HIS VIEWS, MUCH BETTER THAN HE IS REMEMBERED OR DARE I SAY IT MISREMEMBERED MEMORIES OF HIS EARLY LIFE.
Jon: BUT THAT IS WHAT IS SO FASCINATING. WHAT I LOVE ABOUT WHAT YOU BROUGHT TO THIS IS CONTEXT BECAUSE AS YOU LIONIZE AN INDIVIDUAL THEY BEGIN TO NARROW.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: IN OUR MEMORY. AND YOU FORGET, YOU KNOW, IT IS LIKE WHEN I LOOK AT A BLACK AND WHITE PICTURE. I FORGET, OH THAT JACKET COULD BE BRIGHT GREEN, THAT HAT COULD BE YELLOW. YOU FORGET THAT PEOPLE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN COLOR.
INDEED.
AND THEY LIVE THIER LIVES IN RELATIONSHIPS. YOU TALKED ABOUT LIONIZE, YOU KNOW, I'VE TRIED TO HUMANIZE GHANDI.
Jon: YES.
GANDHI WAS ORTHODOX HINDU PATRIARCH. AND HE WAS MADE MORE SENSITIVE TO GENDER RIGHTS BY A REMARKABLE WOMAN SECRETARY HE HAD, A JEWISH WOMAN CALLED SONJA SCHLESIN. YOU KNOW,  HE WAS AN UPPER CASTE HINDU BUT IN SOUTH AFRICA BECAUSE HE WAS FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN THE DIASPORA WITH WORKING CLASS TAMILS FROM SOUTH INDIA. HE UNDERSTOOD THE ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF HIS COUNTRY.
Jon: RIGHT.
HAD GANDHI SUCCEEDED AT THE BAR IN BOMBAY, YOU KNOW, GANDHI AS A YOUNG MAN GOES TO LONDON, QUALIFIES AS A BARRISTER AND COMES BACK WITH HIS SUIT TO BOMBAY AND FAILS THE BAR NOT JUST ONCE BUT TWICE. AND HAD HE SUCCEEDED AS A LAWYER IN BOMBAY YOU AND I WOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. HE FAILED AND RECEIVED PROFESSIONAL OBLIVION BY AN INVITATION IN SOUTH AFRICA WHERE HE MADE HIS NAME AS AN ACTIVIST AND WHERE HE MET AND BEFRIENDED AN EXTRAORDINARY DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE WHO EXPANDED HIS HORIZON. AND FINALLY, OF COURSE, AGAINST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY LAW IN SOUTH AFRICA HE LAUNCHED THE WORLD'S FIRST NONVIOLENT PROTEST MOVEMENT, LATER FOLLOWED SUCCESSFULLY BY DR. KING AND OTHERS BUT IF THIS MAN HAD SUCCEEDED AS A LAWYER HE WOULD NOT HAVE TRANSFORMED INDIA OR THE WORLD. SO THERE IS A LESSON IN THIS.
Jon: THERE IS A LESSON. AND LET THIS LESSON GO OUT TO JEWISH MOTHERS EVERYWHERE. IF YOUR SON DOES NOT BECOME A LAWYER OR A DOCTOR, IT IS NOT TRAGEDY, BUT, IN FACT, A PRECURSOR TO GREATNESS!  THANK YOU! HERE'S WHAT'S SO FASCINATING, TOO. SO, [ APPLAUSE ] WHEN YOU SAY --
NOT JUST JEWISH MOTHERS, BUT INDIAN MOTHERS.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS A UNIVERSAL TRAIT AMONGST THE MOTHER CLASS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GANDHI BEFORE, IT IS HARD TO THINK OF HIM EXISTING OUT OF INDIA AND THE IDEA THAT EVEN HIS FIRST RISE TO CONSCIOUSNESS OF OPPRESSION WAS NOT EVEN WITHIN INDIA BUT SOUTH AFRICA AND ALMOST NOT FOR THE APARTHEID STATE AND SUBJUGATION OF THE BLACK POPULATION BUT THE INDIAN POPULATION THAT IS LIVING IN THE DIASPORA THERE.
YES. YOU KNOW, THE INDIANS, THEY WERE SEEN AS A SECT BY THE EUROPEANS, BECAUSE OF COURSE THE AFRICANS ARE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS AND OF COURSE THEY WOULD SOMETIMES RISE IN INSURRECTIONS BUT THEY WERE DISPERSED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THEY WERE NOT EDUCATED. THE INDIANS WERE RUNNING SHOPS ON THE EUROPEN MAIN STREET, DISPLACING DUTCH AND BRITISH SHOPKEEPERS. YOU HAD ERNEST LAWYERS LIKE GANDHI WHO MIGHT TAKE OVER YOUR BUSINESS, INDIANS ARE BECOMING DOCTORS SO THERE WAS A KIND OF PARANOIA ABOUT INDIANS AND WHO MIGHT MIGRATE IN THEIR LARGE HOARDS FROM THE EAST AND CLAIM THE CONTINENT YOU HAD COME IN, YOU KNOW, COLONIZING FROM THE WEST. SO, THE FIRST RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY LAWS SOME OF THEM WERE APPLIED AGAINST INDIANS AND THE INDIAN RESISTANCE LED BY GANDHI, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, THEN BECAME MUCH GREATER AND MORE WIDESPREAD, THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS WAS FOUNDED IN 1912 TOWARD THE END OF GANDHI'S STAY IN SOUTH AFRICA AND ITS PARTLY INFLUENCED BY GANDHI'S EXAMPLE. OF COURSE GANDHI WAS LIMITED AND HE WASN'T A UNIVERSAL FIGURE AND DIDN'T REACH OUT TO THE AFRICANS. HE HAD AFRICAN FRIENDS BUT HE DID TAKE UP THEIR CAUSE, BUT BY SLOWLY AND PERSISTENTLY UNDERMINING THE RACIAL EDIFICE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN STATE IN A MODEST WAY HE PREPARED THE WAY FOR NELSON MANDELA AND ALL THE GREAT FIGURES WHO FOLLOWED IN SOUTH AFRICA ITSELF AND OF COURSE HE TRAINED HIMSELF TO UNDERTAKE THE KIND OF MASSIVE FREEDOM STRUGGLE HE WAS TO DO IN INDIA. SO, SOUTH AFRICA WAS FORMATIVE TO GANDHI. AND IT WAS IGNORED IN EARLIER BOOKS, SO I
Jon: AND FORMATIVE IN OTHER WAYS ALSO BECAUSE HIS INFLUENCES ARE COMING FROM TOLSTOY, FROM ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT. IT IS FASCINATING.
YES. AGAIN, IT IS CURIOUS, JON, GANDHI SO FAR AS I KNOW, NEVER READ WAR AND PEACE OR ANNA KARENINA, HE HAD NO INTEREST IN TOLSTOY THE NOVELIST BUT TOLSTOY THE PHILOSOPHER. TOLSTOY WRITES IN QUOTING A LINE FROM THE BIBLE, THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU. THAT IS YOUR PATH TO TRUTH AND SPIRITUALITY IS NOT WHAT THE BISHOP SAYS OR WHAT THE HOLY IMMAN SAYS NOT WHAT THE HINDU HOLY MAN SAYS BUT YOU FIND IT YOURSELF. SO IT'S IN THE DIASPORA THAT HE READS TOLSTOY. IF HE WAS IN INDIA, HE PROBABLY WOULD NEVER HAVE ENCOUNTERED IT.
Jon: RIGHT. IT IS A FASCINATING LOOK FROM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE AND I LOVE IT, AND YOUR ENTHUSIASM IS MAKING ME VERY HAPPY RIGHT NOW. I REALLY DO. THIS IS AN EXCITING BOOK AND AN EXCITING PROJECT, GANDHI BEFORE INDIA. IT IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. GET IT. RAMACHANDRA GUHA, THANK YOU, SIR.
