Jon: BOOM! BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! WE ARE BACK! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WELCOME BACK. MY GOODNESS. WHAT -- WOW! DID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE  DAYS WHERE EVERYTHING YOU EVER  LOVED AS A CHILD WAS UNDERWATER? (LAUGHTER)  OBVIOUSLY ABSOLUTELY INSANE  SITUATION UNFOLDED HERE IN THE  NEW JERSEY NEW YORK TRISTATE  EASTERN SEA BOARD -- FOR THOSE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT  THROUGH STEEL DEALING WITH THE  AFTEREFFECTS, MILLIONS WITHOUT  POWER AND WATER, THOUSANDS DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES. HERE IN MANHATTAN THE POWER IS  STILL OUT DOWNTOWN OR, AS WE  REFER TO IT NOW, LITTLE NORTH  CAROLINA. (LAUGHTER)  FOR MORE ON THE CITY AND THE  AFTEREFFECTS OF HURRICANE SANDY  WE GO TO AL MADRIGAL. AL, WHAT'S THE SCENE LIKE  DOWNTOWN, AL? (LAUGHTER)
JOHN, DOWNTOWN'S STILL  DEVASTATED. MANY TUNNELS FILLED WITH SEA  WATER, GROCERY STORES EMPTIED  AND THERE'S BEEN NO ELECTRICITY  SINCE THE SUBSTATION EXPLODED JUST AROUND THERE UP 14th  STREET. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: AL, WHAT IS THAT  STRAPPED TO YOUR BACK, AL?
OH, YEAH, IT'S A MACHETE,  JOHN. SEE, THERE'S TWO TYPES OF FOLKS  STILL DOWN HERE IN NO-JUICE  TOWN. (LAUGHTER)  PEOPLE WITH MACHETES AND DEAD  PEOPLE WITHOUT MACHETES. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: AL, WE'RE GOING TO GO  UP TOWN TO JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, WHAT'S IT LIKE UP THERE? (LAUGHTER)
IT'S A TOTAL HELL SCAPE UP  HERE. FOR STARTERS-- AND I DON'T WANT  TO CAUSE A PANIC-- SERENDIPITY  HAS RUN OUT OF MOCHA SPRINKLES. (LAUGHTER)  WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION, JOHN,  WHERE THE (BLEEP) IS FEMA WHEN  YOU NEED THEM? (LAUGHTER)  I WILL SAY, THOUGH, I DON'T KNOW  IF YOU'RE TRIED SERENDIPITY'S HE  CAN OF A JOB BROWNIE BUT IT IS TO DIE FOR.
Jon: JESSICA, IS THAT YOU?
YEAH!
Jon: ARE THOSE RATS ON YOUR  JACKET?
YEAH, YOU BUYING? FREE RANGE. FRESH. (LAUGHTER)  VERY FRESH.
Jon: JESSICA, IS EVERYTHING  OKAY?
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE MOVED TO  THE UPPER WEST SIDE BUT, NO,  LOWER EAST SIDE IS WHERE IT'S  AT. LOWER EAST SIDE IS COOL. THEY HAVE INDIAN FOOD!
JESS, JESSICA, PLEASE  UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE UP HERE IS  NO PICNIC. WE'RE BARELY MAKING DO. (LAUGHTER)  MY BOOK OF MORMON SEATS TONIGHT? OBSTRUCTED VIEW. (LAUGHTER)
ALL I'VE HAD TO DRINK TODAY  IS URINE. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOUR OWN URINE, I  HOPE, AL, IS THAT --
NO! EVERYONE'S. BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMUNITY! OKAY? THERE IS NO "I" IN "URINE."  (LAUGHTER).
Jon: ACTUALLY, AL, THERE IS  AN "I" IN "URINE."
WELL, THERE'S ALSO A "U."
Jon: THANK YOU, EVERYBODY,  WE'LL CHECK IF WITH YOU GUYS  LATER. ANYWAY, IT'S BEEN A HARROWING  COUPLE OF DAYS FOR ALL OF US. ONCE AGAIN A HUGE DEBT OF  GRATITUDE NOT ONLY TO FIRST  RESPONDERS WHO HAVE RISKED THEIR  LIVES TO SAVE OTHERS OR-- AS THEY CALL IT-- GOING TO WORK. (LAUGHTER)  BUT ALSO THE M.T.A., POWER  COMPANIES, PHONE COMPANIES,  PUBLIC OFFICIALS, WE THANK YOU  ALL TONIGHT IN OUR BRAND NEW SEGMENT "A DAILY SHOW TRIBUTE TO  INSTITUTIONAL COMPETENCE."  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S AMAZING! AMAZING! ONCE YOU REMOVE POLITICAL AND  PARTISAN GAMESMANSHIP FROM A  SITUATION PERFORMANCE IMPROVES  DRAMATICALLY. DOWN THE LINE GOVERNMENT'S BEEN  ON TOP OF ITS STUFF, WE'LL START  WITH N.Y.C. MAYOR MICHAEL  BLOOMBERG. BUT, LISTEN, I THINK WE ALL  AGREE IF THESE CUPS WERE STILL  LEGAL --  (LAUGHTER). -- MAYBE THE CITY WOULD HAVEN'T  FLOODED AT ALL. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT, THAT'S  NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE POINT IS MAYOR BLOOMBERG  KICKED ASS AT HIS JOB AND DID IN THE TWO LANGUAGES. (.
(SPEAKING BROKEN SPANISH)  (LAUGHTER).
Jon: ALL RIGHT. THAT MAY SOUND LIKE WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN YOU WALK IN ON YOUR RABBI  RACTICING WITH W ROSETTA STONE.P  (LAUGHTER) BUT WHEN YOUR CITY IS FLOODING,  THAT IS AS FLUENT AS ANTONIO  (BLEEP)ING BANDERAS. (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, BLOOMBERG WAS  TALKING THREE LANGUAGES IF YOU  COUNT THE CITY'S NEWEST STAR  LYDIA CALLIS WHOSE EXPRESSIVE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETING  TURNED DISASTER PRESS BRIEFINGS  INTO AN ALVIN AILEY SIGN  LANGUAGE RECITAL. (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ALL ACROSS THE REGION SANDY  WREAKED HAVOC ON TREES,  COMMUNITIES, AND POLITICAL TALKING POINTS.
THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF  EXTREME WEATHER INCIDENTS. ANYONE THAT'S NOT A -- THAT'S  NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT,  THAT'S A FACTUAL STATEMENT. ANYONE WHO SAYS THERE'S NOT A  DRAMATIC CHANGE IN WEATHER  PATTERNS I THINK IS DENYING  REALITY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHICH YOU CAN DO UNTIL  REALITY IS UP TO YOUR (BLEEP)ING  CHEST, YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU PEOPLE? (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. DID YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE NEED  GOVERNMENT SERVICES? AND THEY COST MONEY! ASK MY JOB CREATING BILLION FAIR  CAPITALIST WHO'S BEEN IN A  NATURAL DISASTER.
NEW YORK CITY TAXES ITSELF  AND SPENDS THE MONEY TO PROTECT  US AND TO HAVE THE SERVICES THAT WILL KEEP US GOING AND I KNOW OF  NO OTHER CITY THAT DOES THAT. WHICH ALWAYS ANNOYS ME WHEN THEY  SAY "OH, YOU'RE A HIGH-TAXED  PLACE."  YEAH, AND WE GET SOMETHING FOR  IT.
Jon: YOU THINK IT'S CHEAP  TO KEEP THE STATUE OF LIBERTY'S  LEGS SHAVED? IT'S NOT? (LAUGHTER)  SHE'S 200 FEET TALL AND SHE'S  FRENCH. IT'S A BIG JOB! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  MY FAVORITE CAME STRAIGHT OUT OF  NEW JERSEY WHOSE GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE KICKED CRAZY ASS DURING THE STORM. HE'S BEEN ONE OF MITT ROMNEY'S  MOST OUTSPOKEN ALLIES THROUGHOUT  THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN. THIS IS HIM 12 DAYS AGO.
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW  HOW TO LEAD. HE'S LIKE A MAN WANDERING AROUND  IN A DARK ROOM HANDS UP AGAINST  THE WALL CLUTCHING FOR THE LIGHT  SWITCH OF LEADERSHIP AND HE JUST CAN'T FIND IT AND HE WON'T FIND  IT UNTIL THE NEXT 18 DAYS!
Jon: OBAMA COULDN'T FIND A  STACK OF OLD NEWSPAPERS IN AN  EPISODE OF "HOARDERS" I'M  TELLING YOU. THIS GUY COULDN'T FIND A  CONTAINER AT THE CONTAINER  STORE, I'M TELLING YOU. OBAMA COULDN'T LEAD A BUNCH OF  EELS TO THE SARGASSO SEA-- THEIR  NATURAL SPAWNING GROUNDS. (LAUGHTER)  SO, YOU KNOW, LOOK IT UP. BUT THAT WAS, OF COURSE, WHEN  AMERICA WAS STILL LIVING IN A  PRE9 '11 STORM SURGE MENTALITY.
I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT  PERSONALLY FOR HIS PERSONAL  ATTENTION TO THIS HE ACCELERATED THE MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION  FOR NEW JERSEY WITHOUT THE USUAL  RED TAPE. THE COOPERATION FROM THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ALL OVER  THIS AND HE DESERVES GREAT  CREDIT.
Jon: YEAH, I GUESS HE FOUND  THAT (BLEEP)ING LIGHT SWITCH,  HUH? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  GREAT CREDIT -- TO HIS GREAT  CREDIT TKORB HIS GREAT CREDIT,  CHRIS CHRISTIE REALIZED THE STORM WAS REAL AND THAT HE HAD A  JOB TO DO AS GOVERNOR SO IT WAS  TIME TO SLALOM DOWN BULL (BLEEP)  MOUNTAIN AND DEAL WITH THIS OBAMA, NOT THIS OBAMA. (LAUGHTER)  NOT EVERYBODY GOT THE MEMO.
OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS,  YOU HAVE APPEARED THROUGHOUT THE  COUNTRY ON BEHALF OF MITT  ROMNEY, WE HEAR THAT PERHAPS HE'S GOING TO -- MR. ROMNEY MAY  DO SOME STORM-RELATED EVENTS. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT  GOVERNOR ROMNEY MAY GO TO NEW  JERSEY TO TOUR THE DAMAGE WITH  YOU? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ARE YOU KIDDING ME,  DOOCY? (LAUGHTER)  LOOK AT CHRISTIE.
I HAVE NO IDEA NOR AM I THE  LEAST BIT CONCERNED OR  INTERESTED. I HAVE A JOB TO DO. I'VE GOT 2.4 MILLION PEOPLE OUT  OF POWER. I'VE GOT DEVASTATION ON THE  SHORE. I'VE GOT FLOODS IN THE NORTHERN  PART OF MY STATE. IF YOU THINK RIGHT NOW I GIVE A  DAMN ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS  THEN YOU DON'T KNOW ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: IF I KNOW MY STATE AND  MY GOVERNOR, I BELIEVE THAT IS  THE POINT OF THE CONVERSATION  WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FLIP OVER A TABLE AND YELL "PRO *S  "PROSTITUTION WHORE!"  (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, ON A PERSONAL NOTE I  LIVE IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN --  (LAUGHTER). -- AND AS THE WATER BEGOON RISE  I KNEW THAT MY FAMILY COUNTED ON  ME IN THIS TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED  TROUBLE AND.LAUGH (LAUGHTER)  LAUGH SAM! SAM! I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO DO  SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO  TRANSLATE --
JON, I THINK I GOT THE GIST  OF IT.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
