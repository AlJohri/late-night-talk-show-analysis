[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE BACK. YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING EARLIER I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING, THE BANK'S ABILITIES TO REGULATE THEMSELVES. THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY THE RISKS THEY ARE TAKING. IT WAS CLEAR FOR THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT THEY WORKED VERY, VERY HARD TO HIDE THAT FROM ALL OF US. HOW DO WE MAKE THE REGULATORY REGIME MORE AGILE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS WHERE THINGS CAN MOVE SO MUCH MORE QUICKLY.
IF YOU ACQUIRE MORE CAPITAL, CAPITAL IS EASY TO JUDGE. IN OTHER WORDS, A REGULATOR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FORECAST WHAT A PARTICULAR SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVE IS GOING TO DO BUT HE CAN MAKE A JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT YOUR CAPITAL IS. IF THEY REGULATE THE CAPITAL, YOU CARE FAR LESS ABOUT THE OTHER THINGS THEY ARE GOING TO DO. YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE NEW THINGS THAT WILL OCCUR. BUT ENOUGH ENOUGH CAPITAL IN THERE YOU DON'T CARE.
Jon: WHO IS FIGHTING A NEW RULE ON CAPITAL? WHAT IS THEIR REASON FOR FIGHTING IT? BANKS DON'T WANT TO RAISE CAPITAL BECAUSE IT'S COSTLY IN THE SHORT TERM. WITHOUT GETTING TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS.
Jon: GET IN THERE BABY! YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE TONIGHT? ALL MASTER'S STUDENTS. CAN I TELL YOU WHO IS HERE TONIGHT IN HYMEN -- MINSKI AND HIS FAMILY.
REALLY.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.
HE PASSED AWAY A LONG TIME AGO.
Jon: YES.
THERE MUST BE A REASON WHY THEY'RE ABLE TO FIGHT THAT AND WHY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT.
THIS IS A POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE VIEW YOU ARE HEARING NOW IS A MINORITY VIEW.
Jon: ABOUT CAPITAL.
ABOUT CAPITAL. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU ARE GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE RATE OF RETURN BY RAISING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WILL ADJUST. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD 30% CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN THE LATE PART OF THE 19th CENTURY. AND BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR IT WAS 50%.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE SYSTEM WORKED, BANKING WAS PROFITABLE AND LOTS OF --
Jon: WHEN GLASS STEAGAL WAS IN EFFECT THE SYSTEM WORKED. IT WAS ONE OF CLEAREST EXAMPLES AS WHAT ALLOWED THEM TO CAUSE THE DEVASTATION WHEN THIS THING FAILED.
I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THAT.
Jon: WHO. WHO IS THE EX-FED CHAIRMAN HERE?
I DISAGREE WITH YOU.
Jon: MUCH BETTER. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT LAW THAT YOU THINK WAS --
FIRST OF ALL, THE LAW -- IT HASN'T EXISTED FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. EVEN BEFORE IT WAS REPEALED THERE WAS A SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH CREATED A VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOPHOLE IN GLASS-STEIGEL AND PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL REPEAL IN 2000 IT ESSENTIALLY WAS SHOT FULL OF HOLES.
Jon: IT WAS OBLITERATED.
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IT NO LONGER EXISTED AFTER SO CALLED SECTION 20 AFFILIATES WERE ENGAGED BY THE --
Jon: THE SECTION 20 AFFILIATES I KNEW WHEN IT WAS DONE IT WAS TERRIBLE -- I KNEW WHEN THE SECTION 19 WAS -- AND THEN TO HAVE SECTION 20 AS WELL. [ LAUGHTER ]
ASK ME WHAT SECTION 19 IS.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SECTION 19?
HAVEN'T A CLUE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: FAIR ENOUGH. THESE GUYS THAT CREATED. THIS THE ONE THING I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS THIS WAS -- I DON'T TO WANT TO SAY PURPOSEFUL BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY PREMEDITATED. THESE GUYS WERE ATTEMPTING TO SUCK AS MUCH AS THEY COULD OUT OF A SYSTEM UNTIL IT COLLAPSED AROUND THEM AND THEY COULD GET OUT. THERE MUST BE SOME WAY THAT THERE'S A FORCE LARGE ENOUGH TO AT LEAST TEMPER THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE. AND IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO PROTECT OUR PENSIONS AND SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FROM THIS TYPE OF SPECULATION.
I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO DO THAT IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL. PEOPLE SPECULATE BECAUSE THEY GET EUPHORIC, GREEDY, WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO USE. YOU CAN'T PREVENT IT IT'S HUMAN NATURE. SO THE POINT TO FOCUS ON IS HOW DO YOU PROTECT THE SYSTEM, SOCIETY FROM THE STUFF THAT GOES ON. THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE ACTIONS THAT CAUSE PROBLEMS SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
Jon: WHEN IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN?
IT HAPPENS WHEN CAPITAL GETS UP WHERE IT'S ENOUGH LIKE IT WAS IN THE LATTER PART OF THE 19th CENTURY.
Jon: LAST POINT. IN THIS REGARD WHEN WE SEE THE DAMAGE THE SPECULATION CAN DO WHY DO WE STILLULATION CAN DO INSIST INVESTMENT INCOME BE TAXED AT A DIFFERENT RATE THAN WORK INCOME. DOESN'T THAT INDICATE INCENTIVIZING WORK AT LESS OF A RATE THAN INVESTMENT AND DOESN'T THAT JUST FAVOR THE CLASS THAT HAS GAINED A GREAT DEAL OF THE WEALTH OVER THE CLASS THAT HAS HELPED THEM BUILD IT?
ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE -- THE ONLY TIME WE'VE HAD REAL SUBSTANTIAL TAX REFORM WAS 1986. AND AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT THEY MADE THEM EQUAL-- THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD BE. THIS GOES BACK A LONG WAY, ALMOST VERY SHORTLY AFTER THE -- THE AMENDMENT IN 1913 WHICH CREATED THE INCOME TAX. BUT THIS IS A DEBATABLE ISSUE AND I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCES MYSELF.
Jon: RIGHT. BECAUSE THERE'S NO -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GET TO A CERTAIN POINT. THESE GUYS AGAIN IT INCENTIVIZED RISK TO SOME EXTENT. IN A WAY IF YOU SAY THIS HUBRIS AND GREED IS A PART OF OUR PERSONALITY.
YOU WON'T ELIMINATE THAT.
Jon: IT SEEMS FROM GOING TO 25% ON CAPITAL GAINS WOULDN'T ELIMINATE RISK BUT GIVES A FAIR SHOT TO INCOME WHICH SEEMS LIKE SHOULD BE --
IT'S A VALID ARGUMENT.
Jon: REALLY? I'M GOING TO END ON THAT THEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] "THE MAP AND THE TERRITORY" ON BOOKSHELVES NOW. YOUNG MAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ALAN GREENSPAN.
