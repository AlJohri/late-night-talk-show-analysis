[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WE WILL IMOOK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE THE  FILMMAKERS BEHIND THE NEW  DOCUMENTARY HUNGER IN AMERICA A PLACE AT THE TABLE.
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE THEM  OFF?
GOOD JOB ON THE BASKETBALL  GAME.
IT'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT, THE  CHURCHES AND COMMUNITY GROUPS  THAT HANDOUT OUT ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO THOSE  EXPERIENCING HUNGER BUT IT'S A  QUICK FIX FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW AND MAYBE NEXT WEEK.
WE CALL IT EMERGENCY FOOD. IT'S NO LONGER EMERGENCY FOOD. IT'S CALLED CHRONIC USE OF A  BROKEN SYSTEM FOR WHICH PEOPLE  CAN IN THE BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME TO THE  PROGRAM LORI SILVERBUSH AND  KRISTI JACOBSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU? PLEASE SIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING US.
Jon: I'M GOING TO SAY THIS  RIGHT OFF THE BAT, YOU'VE DONE  AN INCREDIBLY DONE FILM. I WANT THIS SEEN IN THE BROADEST  WAY POSSIBLE. WHO IS GOING TO SEE THIS? WHAT IS GOING HAPPEN?
ON MARCH 1 IT'S GOING TO BE  RELEASED IN THEATERS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, ONDEMAND AND ON ITUNES AND ACCOMPANIED BY A  HUGE SOCIAL ACTION CAMPAIGN THAT  WILL LIVE IN THE ATMOSPHERE.
Jon: ABOUT ENDING THIS  HUNGER PROBLEM IN THE UNITED  STATES.
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THIS IS  REALLY SOLVABLE. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES OUR  TIME WE CAN FIX WELL. HE KNOW HOW. WE KNOW WHAT CAUSES HUNGER. WE NOW TO FIX IT. WE WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THE FILM  AND ENGAGE AND SET UP MANY YEARS  IN THE MAKING CAMPAIGN. IT'S GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE TOOLS  THEY CAN ENGAGE. WE CAN FIX THIS ONE. IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN GET RIGHT.
Jon: 15 MILLION PEOPLE IN  AMERICA. ONE IN SIX.
AND 17 MILLION KIDS.
Jon: CRAZY. ONE OUT OF EVERY TWO CHILDREN  HAS AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES  WILL HAVE SOME FORM OF HUNGER INSECURITY WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW  WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS.
AND THEIR PARENTS ARE  SPENDING TIME AND ENERGY AND  RESOURCES SCROUNGING FOR FOOD INSTEAD OF WORKING, LOOKING FOR  WORK, CONTRIBUTING TO CHURCHES  OR SYNAGOGUES. YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT IT SAYS  ABOUT US AS A NATION THAT WE ARE  CONTENT TO LET 50 MILLION SPEND THEIR DAY DOING THAT.
Jon: THIS IS INTERESTING TO  SEE. I THINK THERE'S A SENSE IN THE  COUNTRY THAT THERE'S A MOOCHER  CLASS LIVING THE LIFE OF RILEY, KICKING THEIR HEELS BACK, DINING  ON THE HAM AND MASHED POTATOES  EVERY NIGHT ON THE TAXPAYER  DOLE. THESE ARE WORKING PEOPLE. 80% ARE WORKING, YES?
80% OF PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS  ARE WORKING FAMILIES.
Jon: THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF  PROBLEMS. ONE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT WE DON'T  HAVE ENOUGH FOOD.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT. WE HAVE ENOUGH CALORIES TO FEED  ENOUGH PEOPLE DOUBLE WHAT THINK  NEED TO LIVE WELL. IS SCARCEITY IS NOT THE ISSUE AT  ALL.
Jon: SCARCEITY IT'S NOT THE  ISSUE BUT FINANCIALLY IT'S  EASIER AND CHEAPER TO BUY CRAPPY FOOD THAN DECENT FOOD.
YES, YOU TALKED BEFORE ABOUT  THE MOOCHER MENTALITY. WE FILMED PEOPLE STRUGGLING  EVERY DAY TO TRYING TO PUT  HEALTHY FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS  TOLL HEALTHY FOOD LET ALONE ARE  THEY ABLE TO AFFORD IT.
Jon: THIS WAS A PROBLEM  THAT AMERICANS KISS COVERED. I'M SURE IT'S BEEN HERE WITHIN  THE COUNTRY IN THE 170'S.
-- 1970'S.
IT'S A BIG INSPIRATION TO US. IN 1968 CBS DID A SHOW ON HUNGER  IN AMERICA. WHEN PEOPLE SAW THIS, THEY  REALLY FOUND IT UNACCEPTABLE,  PICKED UP THE PHONE AND CALLED THE LEGISLATORS AND WITHIN TWO  WEEKS CONGRESS CREATED  BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION THAT CREATED THE MODERN FOOD SAFETY. IT ENDED HUNGER BY THE 1970'S. ENDED IT. THEY RADICALLY MODERNIZED IT.
THEY WENT BACK TO THE AREAS  THEY STUDIED AND REPORTED ON TEN  YEARS LATER AND FOUND THAT THE HUNGER HAD BEEN -- WAS GONE.
Jon: NOW THAT WE FOUND THE  SOLUTION TO THE HUNGER PROBLEM,  WHAT CAN WE DO AS A GOVERNMENT, AS A NATION AT THAT POINT?
IN A WORD:  REAGAN. HE FLIPPED A SWITCH. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW -- INSTEAD  OF SEEING HOW IT WAS IN OUR  COLLECTIVE BEST INTEREST TO FEED  EVERYBODY. WE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO  GET A FREE RIDE.
THEY CUT THE FUNDING AND AS A  RESULT IT SHIFTED THE  RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEALING WITH THE HUNGRY IN THIS COUNTRY TO  CHARITIES, FAITH-BASED GROUPS  AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
Jon: THE THEORY IS ALWAYS  HEY, MAN, GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO  SCREW THINGS UP. CHARITIES ARE GOING TO DO IT. SO WE WENT FROM HAVING 2000 FOOD  BANKS TO -- 40,000 WAS IT?
40,000.
Jon: HOW MANY NOW?
40,000 BUT IT'S TOO BIG FOR  THOSE GROUPS TO HANDLE. THEY HAVE TOLD US. ALL OF THE TIME THAT THE NEED IS  TOO GREAT AND WE NEED REAL  GOVERNMENT ACTION ON THIS ISSUE.
Jon: THESE GROUPS ARE  DOING. YOU ARE WATCHING THE WORK THEY  ARE DOING. IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THE  CHARITIES ARE DOING ARE PUTTING  INTO THIS. THE GUY, LOVELY GUY PASTER BOB. I WENT THE FIRST TIME AND I GOT  TWO BAGS OF GROSS RIZ NOW IT'S  DRIVING TRACTORS BACK AND FORTH TWICE A DAY TRYING TO KEEP UP  WITH THE NEED.
IN HIS VERY SMALL TOWN OF  WORKING FAMILIES. IF CHARITY COULD HAVE FIXED IT  IT WOULD HAVE BECAUSE WE'VE  NEVER HAD A CHARITY RESPONSE FROM THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS  NATION LIKE WE DO RIGHT NOW.
Jon: THERE'S A SEEN WHEN  YOU GO DOWN TO CONGRESS TO DO A  HEARING AND BOY IF A CONGRESS HAD A LOW APPROVAL RATING BEFORE  THAT, THE DISCONNECT -- EVEN ON  AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL, THE CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE YOU GOT  WAS SHOCKING.
IT WAS DISHEARTENING TO SAY  THE LEAST.
Jon: THAT'S A KIND WAY TO  DESCRIBE IT.
YEAH, TO WITNESS THAT BUT AT  THE SAME TIME WE ALSO PAST  TOURED THE WITNESSES TO HUNGER, THESE INCREDIBLE WOMEN FROM  NORTH PHILLY WHO TRAVELED TO  HAVE THEIR VOICED BE HEARD. THERE WERE INSPIRING THINGS  TAKING PLACE IN THAT PLACE  CALLED D.C. ALSO.
Jon: THE WOMEN WERE GREAT  BUT EVEN IN THAT, ONE WOMAN,  WONDERFUL WOMAN WHO ENDS UP GETTING A JOB WAY HUNGER GROUP. BY GETTING THAT JOB WHICH DOES  NOT PAY HER TREMENDOUS AMOUNT  SHE'S DISQUALIFIED FOR ASSISTANCE AND FINDS HERSELF IN  A SITUATION WHERE SHE'S  STRUGGLING.
IT'S SHOCK. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN BE  MAD AT OUR GOVERNMENT BUT WE'VE  BEEN TALKING TO LEGISLATORS ABOUT THIS. THEY SAY THE PHONES AREN'T  RINGING. WE'RE NOT GETTING TISMS OR  TWEETS ON THIS AND WE'LL CHANGE  HOW WE VOTE. WE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER  AGAIN. I BUY IT. SOMEONE TOLD US IF HE GOT SIX  PHONE CALLS ON THE ISSUE BECAUSE  HE ASSUMES A COUPLE,000 PEOPLE ARE NOT CALLING. GET INVOLVED. WE MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO DO  THAT.
Jon: POOR PEOPLE NEED A  BETTER LOBBY I THINK. THIS IS GOING TO BE IN THEY'RE  ADVERTISE, ONDEMAND, iTUNES ON  MARCH 1. YOU'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB. JUST A BEAUTIFUL JOB. ALL AROUND LORI SILVERBUSH,  KRISTI JACOBSON WE'LL BE RIGHT  BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
