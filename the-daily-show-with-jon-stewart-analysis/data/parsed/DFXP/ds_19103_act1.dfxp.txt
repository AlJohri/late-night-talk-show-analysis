FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD ONE TONIGHT, MY GUEST DR. MARTIN BLASER HERE TO TELL US WHY WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE OF FORMERLY TREATABLE DISEASES. (LAUGHTER) SPEAKING OF MEDIEVAL SCOURGES THAT SHOULD BE ERADICATED, HORRIBLE GOINGS-ON IN NIGERIA.
NEARLY THREE WEEKS AGO IN NORTHERN NIGERIA HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, POSSIBLY MORE THAN 200 OF THEM, WERE KIDNAPPED FROM THEIR SCHOOL IN A REMOTE VILLAGE.
Jon: AH! WHAT KIND OF EVIL SATANIC INDIVIDUAL WOULD STOOP TO SUCH INHUMAN DEPTHS.
THE ATTACKERS ARE BELIEVED TO BE MEMBERS OF BOKO HARAM, A MILITANT AL QAEDA INSPIRED GROUP THAT WANTS ITS OWN ISLAMIC STATE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.
Jon: OH RIGHT. SUPER RELIGIOUS SATANIC PEOPLE. FOR, DOES IT NOT SAY IN THE QURAN, KIDNAP THE INNOCENT GIRLS FOR THEY ARE STUDYING-- OH IT DOESN'T SAY THAT, RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, [BLEEP] AL QAEDA.
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" TODAY READ ABDUCTION OF GIRLS AN ACT NOT EVEN AL QAEDA CAN CONDONE.
Jon: WOW. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO GET A JEWISH GUY TO GO I AGREE WITH AL QAEDA. BUT WOW. SO THE NIGERIAN GROUP BOKO HARAM JUST OVERTON WINDOW-ED AL QAEDA, THE GROUP THAT NEVER SAW SOMETHING FULL OF CIVILIANS IT DIDN'T WANT TO BLOW UP IS SAYING, TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH. WHO IS THE NIGERIAN MANIAC WHO HAS CAUSED AL QAEDA TO COMPLAIN THAT HE IS BESMIRCHING THEIR GOOD NAME?
NIGERIA--  (LAUGHTER)
NIGERIA--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I THINK I'VE JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT I WANT IRONMAN 4 TO BE ABOUT. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) HOLY CRAP. BY THE WAY, THAT THING THAT SHEKAU IS WAVING IS NOT AS YOU WOULD ASSUME DRUG PARAPHERNALIA, IT IS CALLED A MISWAK, A TOOTH-CLEANING TWIG FAVORED BY THE PROPHET MOHAMMED AND STILL POPULAR IN MANY PARTS OF THE MUSLIM WORLD. SHEKAU IS USING ONE BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU ARE A SOULLESS, FOREST DWELLING LUNATIC, YOU SHOULDN'T NEGLECT YOUR GUMS. (LAUGHTER) HIS PARENTS TAUGHT HIM GOOD ORAL HYGIENE AND THEN STOPPED TEACHING HIM THINGS. (LAUGHTER) NIGERIA, THE MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY IN AFRICA, ONE OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIES IN AFRICA MUST BE BLOWING OUT ALL THE STOPS TO GET THESE GUYS.
THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO SWEEP THIS WHOLE THING UNDER THE RUG FOR THE LONGEST TIME.
Jon: REALLY? HOW BIG ARE NIGERIAN RUGS? (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE I CAN SEE SWEEPING MINERAL RIGHTS CORRUPTION UNDER THE RUG, BUT HUNDREDS OF MISSING GIRLS, WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BIGGER RUG.
MANY NIGERIANS HAVE SHARPLY CRITICIZED THEIR PRESIDENT GOODLUCK JONATHAN FOR HIS SLOW RESPONSE.
NIGERIA'S PRESIDENT REJECTED INTERNATIONAL HELP FOR WEEKS.
IT WAS THREE WEEKS BEFORE PRESIDENT GOODLUCK JONATHAN SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING PUBLICLY.
Jon: JUST TO BE CLEAR. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. GOODLUCK JONATHAN IS IS THE NIGERIAN PRESIDENT'S ACTUAL NAME. (LAUGHTER) THEY ARE NOT JUST SAYING YOU'RE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF A CORRUPT DIVIDED COUNTRY OVERRUN WITH NUT BAG TERRORISTS WHO HAVE ALSO INFILTRATED YOUR MILITARY GOOD LUCK, JONATHAN, THAT'S NOT IT, IT'S HIS ACTUAL NAME. IT'S NOT A MODIFIER. SO THE PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA TOOK THREE WEEKS TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ABOUT ONE OF THE MOST HORRIFYING ATROCITIES ANY PEOPLE OR COUNTRY COULD SUFFER. WHY IS HE TALKING NOW?
THE ABDUCTIONS IN NIGERIA WERE ON APRIL 15th,  BUT THE STORY DID NOT GAIN TRACTION ON-LINE UNTIL APRIL 23rd. WHEN TWO NIGERIANS TWEETED #BRING BACK OUR DAUGHTERS. WITHIN DAYS A NEW SLOGAN #BRING BACK OUR GIRLS WAS BEING SHARED AROUND THE WORLD.
Jon: I OWE TWITTER AN APOLOGY. YOU'RE NOT JUST FOR CASUAL RACISM AND DICK PICS. I'M SORRY. AND FOR WEEKS,  NIGERIA TURNED DOWN ANY INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE BUT NOW --
INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS FROM A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE U.S. ARE NOW ASSISTING IN THE SEARCH FOR THESE GIRLS.
BRITISH AND FRENCH TROOPS.
ISRAEL IS SENDING TROOPS THERE.
THE CHINESE ARE ALSO LENDING A HAND THERE, SO THERE IS A HUGE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT.
Jon: SEE, THAT'S THE THING ABOUT HASHTAG ACTIVISM. IT CANNOT FORCE A CRAZY PERSON TO DO SOMETHING. BUT IT CAN SHAME A LESS CRAZY PERSON INTO NOT DOING NOTHING WHILST APPARENTLY DRIVING A MEDIUM CRAZY PERSON CRAZIER.
APPARENTLY THERE IS A TWITTER, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, HANDLE, IS MRS. OBAMA LOOKING SAD. IS THAT NOT PATHETIC? WHAT THE-- WHAT THE HELL MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND-- IT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. THE SAD THING HERE IS THAT THE LOW INFORMATION CROWD THAT'S PUDDLING AROUND OUT THERE ON TWITTER IS GOING TO THINK WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING.
AT LEAST SHE IS TRYING, MR. LIMBAUGH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, AT LEAST MRS. OBAMA CARES, AT LEAST THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEM BACK.
Jon: HE SEEMS NICE. YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH, RUSH, YOU'RE RIGHT. SOMETIMES THE WORLD HAS TO CHOOSE SIDES. LET'S HEAR OUR CHOICES. UH-HUH, SO THAT'S MALALA YOUSAFZAI EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH THE VICTIMS OF THIS OUTRAGE. WHAT IS OUR OTHER CHOICE, OH RIGHT, THAT (bleep) GUY. SO, THAT'S OUR CHOICE, MALALA OR RUSH, THE QUIVERING RAGE HEAP WHO IS APPARENTLY DESPERATELY TRYING TO  EXTINGUISH ANY REMAINING MOLECULE OF HUMANITY THAT MIGHT STILL RESIDE IN THE CHERNOBYL-ESQUE SUPERFUND CLEANUP SITE THAT WAS HIS SOUL. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHO SHOULD WE GO WITH? WHO SHOULD WE CHOOSE? WELL, I DON'T KNOW, WHY DON'T WE TWEET OUR VOTES TO  #[BLEEP]YOURUSH. BUT NOW-- BUT NOW THAT BOKO HARAM --  BUT LET'S GO TO THE REAL VILLAIN HERE, BOKO HARAM. NOW THAT BOKO HARAM HAS THE WORLD'S ATTENTION, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE?
Jon: SO MORE PROSE THAN POETRY, REALLY. (LAUGHTER) SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE FORMING A PUNK BAND. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO SO HARD TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT YOU ARE SUCH BAD ASSES BUT ALL YOU'VE DONE WITH THIS KIDNAPPING IS HIGHLIGHT WHO THE REAL BAD ASSES ARE, THE KIDS YOU KIDNAPPED. COMPARED TO A TEENAGER WHO KNOWS THAT HER DESIRE FOR AN EDUCATION COULD GET HER DRAGGED INTO A SNAKE INFESTED JUNGLE, TO BE SOLD AS A BRIBE BY SOME DEMENTED STICK CHEWING CARTOON VILLAIN BUT STILL GETS UP AND GOES TO CLASS EVERY DAY, FULLY AWARE OF THAT DANGER, COMPARED TO THEIR COURAGE, I'D SAY BOKO HARAM IS A BUNCH OF LITTLE GIRLS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT COMPLIMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
