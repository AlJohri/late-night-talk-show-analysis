John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! I AM JOHN OLIVER STILL -- STILL  SITTING IN FOR JON STEWART. JON STEWART WAS OUT HIKING AND  NOW HAS HIS ARM CAUGHT UNDER A  BOULDER. (LAUGHTER)  DON'T WORRY, WE HAVE SENT A  RESCUE TEAM TO BRING HIM A SWISS  ARMY KNIFE SO HE CAN CUT HIS ARM  OFF. (LAUGHTER)  OUR GUEST TONIGHT, COMEDIAN AND  AUTHOR JIM GAFFIGAN IS HERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HE HAS A BOOK CALLED DAD IS FAT. BUT FIRST TONIGHT CONGRESS IN  THE A THREE WAY TIE FOR LEAST  POPULAR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. (LAUGHTER)  HOWEVER THEY MAY BE ABOUT TO  ACCOMPLISH-- AND I KNOW IT  SOUNDS IMPROBABLE-- SOMETHING. (LAUGHTER)  SPECIFICALLY IMMIGRATION REFORM  WHICH SUDDENLY HAS SUPPORT EVEN  FROM REPUBLICANS AND FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.
WE'RE IN A DEMOGRAPHIC DEATH  SPIRAL AS A PARTY AND THE ONLY  WAY WE CAN GET BACK IN THE GOOD GRACES WITH THE HISPANIC  COMMUNITY IN MY VIEW IS  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM.
John: AND I, LINDSEY GRAHAM,  SAY TO YOU THE HISPANIC  COMMUNITY, WE CHOOSE TO HELP YOU NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO BUT  BECAUSE MATHEMATICALLY WE FEEL  WE HAVE TO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S HOW ALL HISTORIC SEISMIC  CHANGES HAVE HAPPENED IN  AMERICA-- WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE. SO HOW HAVE THEY MANAGED TO MAKE  THIS BILL BIPARTISAN? WELL, BECAUSE IT'S A WIN-WIN--  GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE  THEY THINK IT WILL WIN THEM HISPANIC VOTES AND GOOD FOR  DEMOCRATS BECAUSE IT WILL  ACTUALLY WIN THEM HISPANIC VOTES (LAUGHTER)  SOT WHAT IS IN THIS INCREDIBLE  PIECE OF LEGISLATION?
THE MEASURE CREATES A 13-YEAR  PATH TO CITIZENSHIP, RAISES THE  CAP ON VISAS FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND STRENGTHENS BORDER  SECURITY.
Jon: OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GREAT! (LAUGHTER)  I'VE GOT TO SAY, AS AN IMMIGRANT  MYSELF, THIS IS ALSO VERY  EXCITING. ALSO SLIGHTLY ANNOYING BECAUSE  IF THIS LAW HAD BEEN PASSED  YEARS AGO I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO SMUGGLE MYSELF INTO AMERICA  DRESSED AS AN ORDER OF FISH AND  CHIPS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THAT MADE FOR A PERILOUS  VINEGARY JOURNEY. TO GET 60 VOTES YOU'RE GOING TO  NEED PRETTY DEEP SUPPORT. JUST HOW MUCH DO DO THE  DEMOCRATS WANT THIS?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Jon: OOH, POR DIOS! (LAUGHTER)  (IN SPANISH ACCENT)  YOU ARE TOO MUCHO. PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO WASH  DOWN YOUR LATINO PANDERING WITH  A MARGARITA. (LAUGHTER)  BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT  POLITICAL POSITIONING, THIS IS  ABOUT ASPIRING TO OUR NATION'S HIGHEST IDEALS, THE PRINCIPLES  THAT DREW OUR ANCESTORS ACROSS  THE SEAS.
IN MY CITY, MR. PRESIDENT,  THE CITY IN WHICH I WAS RAISED  AND IN WHICH I LIVE IS THAT BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE HARBOR  WITH THAT BRIGHT TORCH.
Jon: WE CALL HERON DA THE  DOCK WHORE. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SHE GIVES $5 BLOW JOBS TO  LONGSHOREMEN WHILE HOLDING A  FLASHLIGHT. A REAL NEW YORK INSTITUTION. NOW, WHAT WERE YOU TALKING  ABOUT? (LAUGHTER)  CAN YOU GET DEPORTED FOR TELLING  A JOKE LIKE THAT? SO DEMOCRATS ARE ON BOARD BUT  REPUBLICANS MAY TAKE A LITTLE  MORE CONVINCING, SURE. DR. GRAHAM MAY HAVE A  PRESCRIPTION FOR ELECTORAL  SUCCESS BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY  KNOW THIS IS GOOD FOR THEM THEY'RE GOING RESIST IT-- LIKE A  CHILD WITH VEGETABLES. (LAUGHTER)  OR A FRAT BOY WITH A CONDOM. EVEN THE PRO IMMIGRATION  REPUBLICANS' TONE CAN BE A  LITTLE CLUMSY.
IMMIGRANTS ARE MORE FERTILE  AND THEY LOVE FAMILIES AND THEY  HAVE MORE INTACT FAMILIES AND THEY BRING A YOUNGER POPULATION. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE  TRYING TO HELP BUT I DON'T THINK  YOUR STRONGEST ARGUMENT IS THAT BABY MACHINES WHO LOVE TO  (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  AND HE'S SUPPORTIVE OF THEM. EVEN LATINO REPUBLICANS  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRITING OF  THIS BILL ARE NOW TRYING TO WATER IT DOWN.
I FILED AN AMENDMENT TO  IMPROVE IT EVEN FURTHER. I'M SAYING WHEN YOU APPLY FOR  THAT GREEN CARD AFTER THE  TEN-YEAR PERIOD AND MORE HAS EXPIRED YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO  PROVE THAT YOU'RE PROFICIENT IN  ENGLISH.
John: OKAY, SO I THINK IT'S  ABOUT TO BECOME OFFICIAL. THE RULES TO BECOME AN AMERICAN  CITIZEN ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN  THE RULES TO BECOME MISS UTAH.
FRANKLY MEAN ARE -- SEEN AS  -- THE LEADERS OF THIS SO WE  NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO -- CREATE EDUCATION BETTER SO THAT  WE CAN -- SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NO, NO. THANK YOU. WE THANK YOU, MISS UTAH, FOR  GIVING AMERICA A NEW RING TONE. (LAUGHTER)  AND FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS,  PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH STILL  ISN'T EVEN FAR ENOUGH.
THE BILL DOES VERY LITTLE TO  ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO COME OUT  OF THE SHADOWS WHETHER CHERISH OR USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
John: IT'S NOT YOU HAVE NO  "COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS" AND  SPEAK IT, YOU HAVE TO CHERISH  IT. (LAUGHTER)  CHERISH IT LIKE A MAN WHO TWEETS  OUT SINGLE LETTERS OF THE  ALPHABET TO SO YOU CAN CHERISH EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE  EVERY CHARACTER IS PRECIOUS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMEONE  ELSE HAS AN AMENDMENT TO  PROPOSE.
THAT AMENDMENT BY REPUBLICAN  JOHN CORNYN WOULD FORCE THE  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO REACH SPECIFIC METRICS SUCH  AS APPREHENSION OF AT LEAST 90%  OF ALL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS FOR THE OVERALL LAW TO STAND.
John: 90% BORDER SECURITY. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? BRING NINE FRIENDS WITH YOU AND  YOU GET IN FREE! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  YES, THAT'S THE AUTHOR YOU WILL  BE UP ONE NEW COUNTRY AND DOWN NINE OLD FRIENDS. AND IT ISN'T JUST THE CONTENT OF  THE BILL THAT REPUBLICANS HATE.
THIS IS NOT AN EASY BILL TO  READ.
SUBPARAGRAPH CAPITAL "C"  INDEX -- THE INDEX CALCULATED  UNDER THIS SUBPARAGRAPH FOR A CURRENT YEAR EQUALS THE SUM OF  SUBPARAGRAPH ROMAN NUMERAL I.
I'M SURE YOU KNOW EXACTLY  WHAT THAT MEANS.
Jon: WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT  IT MEANS, BUT TO BE FAIR I'M NOT  A SENATOR. YOU ARE. AND LEGAL JARGON IS KIND OF THE  OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE SENATE. SO IF I MAY FOLLOW A PAGE FROM  YOUR PARTY'S PLAY BOOK, LEARN TO  SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OR GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  TO TO SUM UP, STILL A LOT OF  CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR THIS  IMMIGRATION BILL TO ACHIEVE ITS DREAM OF LEGAL STATUS WITHIN THE  UNITED STATES. NOW CURRENTLY IT'S LIVING IN THE  LAND OF BILLS, BUT IT'S YEARNING  FOR A BETTER LIFE AS A LAW IT PAYS ITS HARD EARNED POLITICAL  CAPITAL TO A GANG OF NOT  ENTIRELY RELIABLE TOYOTAS TO CROSS THE LEGISLATIVE DESERT  ONLY TO GAV GAIT THE PERILOUS  WATERS OF DEBATE HOPING IT CAN EVADE THE DREADED FILIBUSTER  PATROL. (LAUGHTER)  BUT AFTER ALL THAT IT'S SAFE AND  THERE WILL BE NOTHING STOPPING  IMMIGRATION REFORM FROM STARTING ITS BRAND NEW LIFE IN AMERICA.
I'VE GOT REAL CONCERNS ABOUT  THE SENATE BILL.
John: OH, YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. A THOUSAND FOOT HIGH BORDER  FENCE BUILT OUT OF IGNORANCE AND  SPITE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SORRY. SORRY IMMIGRATION REFORM. YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING MADE  INTO LAW SEEM TO BE NO BUENO. WE'LL BE
