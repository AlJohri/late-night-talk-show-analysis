[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS AN INSTRUCTOR AT THE M.I.T. MEDIA LAB AND IS THE CEO OF DITTO LABS. HIS NEW BOOK "ENCHANTED OBJECTS. DESIGN, HUMAN DESIRE, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS ." PLEASE WELCOME DAVID ROSE TO THE SHOW. SIR! NICE TO SEE YOU. COME AND SIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
PLEASE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. THE BOOK IS CALLED "ENCHANTED OBJECTS." NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BOOK, YOU SAY ENCHANTED OBJECTS, YOU SEE THE UMBRELLA. YOU THINK, ALRIGHT, WE'RE IN FOR SOME MARY POPPINS TYPE SITUATION HERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "ENCHANTED OBJECTS?"
WELL, I THINK ABOUT THE CELLPHONE. AND THERE'S BEEN SO MANY AMAZING THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH A CELLPHONE AND WITH APPS. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IT TOTALLY MONOPOLIZES YOUR ATTENTION. LIKE, MOST OF US ARE STARING INTO THIS MOST OF THE DAY.
Jon: YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE?
WELL, I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE, TO BECOME UNGLUED FROM THIS SCREEN AND SPREAD THE APPS INTO EVERY DAY OBJECTS, INTO DESKS, INTO CLOTHING, INTO ROOMS, INTO JEWELRY, JUST LIKE, EVERYWHERE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH NICER WAY TO INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY.
Jon: IT'S ALSO, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WILL THEN BE EASIER FOR COMPUTERS TO BECOME SENTIENT AND TURN ON US AND KILL US. [LAUGHING]
Jon: ARE YOU, ARE YOU ANXIOUS, DO YOU NEED -- WHAT IS THAT?
I HAVE JUST SUCH A DEVICE.
Jon: REALLY?
YEAH.
Jon: HOW CONVENIENT.
I JUST, I WANTED TO SHOW YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AN ENCHANTED OBJECT FOR YOUR HEALTH. NOW THIS IS A GLOW CAP. AND IT ACTUALLY NOTIFIES YOU THROUGH SUBTLE LIGHTS AND SOUND TO TAKE AN IMPORTANT MEDICATION AND IT WILL ALSO TEXT YOU SO YOU DON'T FORGET. SO THIS IS ANOTHER...
Jon: SO, THIS IS IN ESSENCE MY MOTHER IN A CAP FORM.
WELL -- Jon: DOES IT EVER CRITICIZE YOU IN ANY WAY?
I SHARE THE DATA OF MY MEDICATION TAKING WITH MY DAD. AND HE DOES THE SAME WITH ME. SO WE CAN BOTH SORT OF GIVE EACH OTHER [BEEP] EVERY WEEK.
Jon: IS THAT, NOW, BUT WHAT, WHAT HAPPENS NOW,  SO, THIS THING WILL BEEP WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO TAKE IT?
WELL, IT TRIES TO BE AS SUBTLE AS POSSIBLE.
Jon: I SEE.
SO, IT CLEARS ITS THROAT FIRST. AND THEN... [LAUGHING]
Jon: LET ME JUST SAY LIKE, HEY, HEY. HEY, YOUR HEART'S GONNA STOP.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THAT IT WILL BRING, NOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT, I GUESS, WOULD NORMALLY COME UP ON YOUR PHONE.
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU'D REALLY USE A MEDICATION TAKING APP. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOG YOUR MEDS SCHEDULE IN YOUR PHONE.
Jon: SO, THIS IS SLIGHTLY EASIER BECAUSE...
WELL, IT'S SORT OF, IT'S EMBEDDED IN AN EVERY DAY GESTURE. LIKE, YOU HAVE TO OPEN THE CAP TO GET THE MED OUT ANYWAY, SO IF...
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO...
Jon: SO TO JUST BE THERE...
RIGHT. SO, THAT'S THE PROMISE OF A ENCHANTED OBJECT IS TO...
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING.
...TAKE THE EVERY DAY OBJECTS, THE EVERY DAY GESTURES AND EMBED FUNCTIONALITY IN THOSE THINGS.
Jon: IS THERE A CONCERN THAT THEN WE THEN LOSE OUR ABILITY TO BE FUNCTIONAL. IF EVERYTHING -- IF AS SOON AS YOU WALK DOWN STAIRS THE MILK GOES "HEY, WHAT ARE WE HAVING CEREAL?" YOU KNOW, DO YOU, DO YOU LOSE THEN -- HOW DO WE KEEP IT SO THAT IT ENHANCES OUR LIVES WITHOUT US BEING SUBSERVIENT TO THAT TECHNOLOGY.
WELL, I THINK WE ALL NEED HELP IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, THESE DAILY ACTIVITIES. YOU KNOW, I HAVE A FIT BIT ON AND SO DOES THE REST OF MY FAMILY SO WE CAN SORT OF SHARE HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU'RE GETTING, HOW MUCH YOU'RE WALKING. SO, IT'S SORT OF A WAY TO KEEP EVERY BODY HEALTHY.
Jon: RIGHT.
THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF SENSING.
Jon: NOW CAN'T YOU SAY THOUGH, BECAUSE I HAVE A FAMILY. CAN'T YOU SAY TO THEM, I ONLY SLEPT SIX HOURS LAST NIGHT OR JUST COME DOWN AND GO MMMMM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: DOES IT, WHERE DOES THE DATA GO?
WELL, THIS, THIS IS OPT IN. SO, IT GOES TO WHOEVER I CHOOSE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY ALL, ALL...
Jon: TO THEIR WATCH AS WELL...
ALL OF FACEBOOK.
Jon: IT GOES TO FACEBOOK?
WELL, YOU CAN SHARE. IF, YOU KNOW, IT'S YOUR CHOICE AS TO HOW BROADLY YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE INFORMATION.
Jon: WHAT WILL THEY DO? LIKE ONCE -- CAUSE ONCE YOU PUT THIS OUT THERE AND FACEBOOK FINDS OUT YOU TAKE PILLS AND HAD SIX HOURS OF SLEEP THEY WILL [BLEEP] HAUNT YOU. YOU WILL SEE, THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE LISTED ONLY FOR YOU. HOW DO YOU STOP ALL THIS DATA FROM BEING CO-OPTED?
WELL, I GOT A SCALE THAT TWEETS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. [LAUGHING]
AND, UH, THIS WAS SORT OF A -- THIS WAS SORT OF A PROBLEM. I MEAN, I THOUGHT, YOU KNO, I THOUGHT I WAS OPTIMISTIC AND THOUGHT MY WEIGHT COULD SORT OF GO IN THE DOWNWARD DIRECTION. BUT, BUT MY SCALE WOULD TWEET EVERY SATURDAY AUTOMATICALLY. AND, THIS WAS ABOUT THE SAME TIME FOUR SQUARE WAS HAVING YOU CHECK IN, YOU KNOW, TO RESTAURANTS. AND IN MY CASE IT WAS JUST THE SAME BAKERY EVERY SINGLE SATURDAY. [LAUGHING]
AND SO, LIKE I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS THAT REACHED OUT AND THEY WERE LIKE MAYBE THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN YOUR WEIGHT GOING UP AND THE BAKERY.
Jon: I LOVE IT. SO IT'S JUST, IN, IN ESSENCE IT'S LIKE A FOCUS GROUP ON YOUR LIFE TO BE ABLE TO SAY TO YOU, WELL I THINK I KNOW WHY YOU'RE GETTING HEAVIER. BECAUSE YOU'RE... I'M WORRIED THAT YOU'RE PULLING SOMETHING OUT OF YOUR POCKET NOW. WE'VE GOT TO GO.
NO WAIT, WAIT, I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. I HAVE... OH... Jon: I'LL GO, WE'LL THROW. WILL YOU STAY AND TALK ABOUT THAT?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: BECAUSE THIS IS BLOWING MY MIND. OKAY. "ENCHANTED OBJECTS" IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. DAVID ROSE, TAKE YOUR PILLS. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S IN YOUR POCKET.
