WE HAD ON HUSAIN HAQQANI WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH  PAKISTAN. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE PLAYING TO THEIR BASE. SOME MAY BE BELIEVERS. FOR ALL I KNOW THEY TRULY ARE OF THE MIND-SET THAT THIS REGIME IS EVIL AND ANY ENGAGEMENT WITH THEM IS AKIN TO NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN AND HITLER. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S HOW THEY ALWAYS --
OH, THE HITLER ANALOGY, HOW WE LOVE THE HITLER ANALOGY.
Jon: THEY LOVE IT. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IRAN HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. THE LEADERSHIP OF IRAN IN PLAYING THE DEATH TO AMERICA.
OH, YEAH.
Jon: ZIONIST CONSPIRACY CARD EVEN WHEN ROUHANI TWEETED OUT A MESSAGE THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS BACKLASH AGAINST HIM WITHIN IRAN. SO SAYING THAT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION DOES NOT OCCUR, SAYING THAT WE ALLOW THIS TYPE OF DETENTE TO OCCUR, WHOSE TO SAY IT WILL FLOURISH IN IRAN? THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT EASY GO-TO BASE ROUSING ISSUE EITHER.
ABSOLUTELY. LOOK, THERE'S THIS ENTIRE GROUP OF HARDLINE IRANIANS ABSOLUTELY AGAINST THIS DEAL. AND WOULD DO ANYTHING TO MAKE IT FAIL. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT IT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT BY ISOLATING IRAN FOR 30 YEARS, WE'VE DONE THE TYRANT'S WORK FOR THEM. THAT'S HOW A TYRANT STAYS IN POWER BY ISOLATING HIS PEOPLE. WE'VE JUST SORT OF INITIATED AND COMPELLED THAT TYRANNY TO TAKE ROOT IN IRAN. WHAT THIS DEAL DOES IS FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ENGAGEMENT BY IRANIANS FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH WILL HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES TO THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. WHAT IS REMARKABLE HERE IS -- I THINK OF IT AS THIS JENGA GAME THAT HAS BEEN FORMED.
Jon: DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING THERE?
JENGA? THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON A WHILE. THERE'S BEEN SECRET NEGOTIATIONS. THERE'S BEEN PROMISES AND OBAMA HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S A DELICATE SORT OF PUZZLE AND CONGRESS IS THAT DOUCHEY KID WHO POKES AT THE BOTTOM WHO --
Jon: OH, IN JENGA? I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE WERE GOING THERE? I HAD LOST THE METAPHOR THREAD AND I THOUGHT WAIT, WHO DID THEY POKE?
I NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL, EXACTLY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SCUTTLE IT THOUGH, YOU SAY THAT THIS REGIME -- ULTIMATELY IS THIS ABOUT SYRIA OR IS THIS REALLY ABOUT THE MUCH LARGER SHIA DOMINANCE IN A REGION WHERE THE SUNNIS HAVE  DOMINATED FOR SO LONG AND THE SHIA REEMERGENCE IS THAT REALLY AT PLAY? FORGET UNITED STATES GEOPOLITICAL ACTIONS, IRANIAN GEOPOLITICAL ACTIONS? HOW ARE THE SAUDIS ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS AND WILL THIS BE ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE OF THAT?
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY THE JENGA PUZZLE. SO MANY GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES AT STAKE. THE SUNNI SHIA DIVIDE. THE PROBLEM IS AND MANY WOULD AGREE WITH THIS IS WHAT KEEPS US FROM ACTUALLY ENGAGING WITH IRAN ON ISSUES WE SHARE IN COMMON WHETHER IT'S WORKING AGAINST AL QAEDA OR STABILIZING IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND FIGURING OUT A WAY TO END THE SITUATION IN SYRIA, WE NEED IRAN'S HELP IN THOSE SITUATIONS BUT WE CAN'T GET THE HELP BECAUSE THE NUCLEAR THING IS JUST THERE. IT'S THIS OBSTACLE THAT KEEPS US FROM DOING ANYTHING ELSE WE WANT TO DO. THE GREAT PROMISE OF THIS DEAL IS THAT IT WILL FINALLY TAKE THAT THING OFF THE TABLE AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL WITH IRAN ON ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN.
Jon: DEFINE SOME OTHER THING THAT SCUTTLES THE ENTIRE THING.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE BEST FRIENDS.
Jon: WHAT YOU KNOW IS SO STRANGE? THE IRANI IT'S A LAND OF SUCH CULTURE AND ARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENT.
AND HANDSOME PEOPLE? [LAUGHTER] NO?
Jon: THEY ARE OKAY. [LAUGHTER] BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL IN COMMON WITH THEM AND --
IT'S SO AMAZING.
Jon: THE CULTURES ARE SIMILAR.
ANYBODY WHO VISITS IRAN ALWAYS SAYS THIS IT'S CREEPY HOW MUCH IRANIANS AND AMERICANS HAVE IN COMMON. DEEPLY PATRIOTIC, DEEPLY RELIGIOUS.
Jon: LOVE PISTACHIOS.
EVEN OBAMA AND ROUHANI HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER. BOTH ELECTED TO CLEAN UP THE MESS MADE BY THE OTHER GUY. BOTH HAVE TESTY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BOTH OF THEM HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROMISES TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YES.
THERE'S JUST THIS SORT OF AFFINITY WE HAVE BUT WE HAVE TO GET PAST 30 YEARS OF, YOU KNOW, BAD BLOOD.
Jon: CAN WE CALL THEM UP AND JUST SAY OKAY, WE OVERTHREW YOUR GOVERNMENT IN 1953, COME ON.
SORRY WE TOOK YOUR PEOPLE HOSTAGE.
Jon: THEY SAY THAT, WE SAY WE'RE SORRY. THEN WE HUG AND WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIGHT A PROXY WAR WITH EACH OTHER.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL MY WIFE ALL THE TIME IS THAT FOREIGN POLICY IS NOT ABOUT SOLVING PROBLEMS. IT'S ABOUT PRESERVING INTERESTS.
Jon: YES.
AND SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE A SET OF INTERESTS WE HAVE TO PRESERVE. WETHEY HAVE A SET OF INTERESTS THAT WE HAVE TO PRESERVE AND THERE'S WAYS TO WORK WITH EACH OTHER TO MOVE THIS THING A LITTLE BIT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY BUT THE MOST LOGICAL THING WHICH IS LET'S JUST PUT THINGS ON THE TABLE AND SOLVE THEM IS NEVER IN THE CARDS BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE POINT. THAT'S NOT THE GOAL.
Jon: BECAUSE WE WON'T DEAL WITH INTERESTS OR REALITY, WE DEAL ONLY WITH EMOTION AND THE SCAPEGOAT AND THAT'S THE SHAME OF THE WHOLE THING.
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HELP?
Jon: WHAT.
A MOVIE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I'VE SEEN IT AND -- [LAUGHTER]
A LOT OF BUZZ. I TOLD YOU A LOT OF BUZZ. I LIVE IN HOLLYWOOD. A LOT OF BUZZ.
Jon: IT'S A VERY NICE MOVIE. IT AIN'T YALTA. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. ZEALOT SON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. REZA ASLAN THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
