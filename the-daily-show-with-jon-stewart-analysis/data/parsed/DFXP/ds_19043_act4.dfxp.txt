Jon: WHAT'S UP EVERYBODY, WE'RE BACK. WE'RE TALKING TO RICHARD CORDRaY WHO IS THE HEAD OF A BUREAU WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALREADY. [LAUGHTER] I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IN BUSINESS REGULATION CAN BECOME ONEROUS. RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY CAN BE A REAL DRAG ESPECIALLY ON A SMALL BUSINESS. ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING TO ALSO IMPLEMENT LEAN REGULATIONS? SMART REGULATIONS? IN THAT REGARD?
SO FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK OUR REGULATIONS SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A DRAG BY ANYBODY IN TERMS OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? YOU MAKE A LOAN TO SOMEBODY AND YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO  WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPAY THAT LOAN. NOT SET THEM UP TO FAIL. THAT'S BASIC BANKING 101.
Jon: BUT THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE MONEY THAT IT COSTS TO BRING EVERYTHING UP TO SNUFF.
YES. IT SHOULD COST SOME MONEY TO BRING THINGS UP TO SNUFF. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING THAT MONEY TO BRING THEM UP TO SNUFF  BEFOREHAND, BUT IF WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM.
Jon: DOES IT PUT SMALLER BUSINESS AT A DISADVANTAGE TO THE LARGER CORPORATIONS WHO CAN HAVE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS AND SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH ALL THIS, OR ARE THERE TWO TIERS WHERE A SMALLER BUSINESS CAN PERHAPS BE MORE FLUID? BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT CAN  BE A BURDEN, I DO.
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FAIR. IN FACT, SENATOR WARREN AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES WHEN I WORKED WITH HER  AT THIS BUREAU IN THE EARLY DAYS. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TIER OUR REGULATION TO TREAT SMALLER COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS.
NICE. AND THEY DON'T NEED TO BE SUBJECT TO ALL THE SAME  BURDENS   BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T CAUSE THE SAME PROBLEMS. BUT THE BIGGER BANKS CAUSED TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. THEY BLEW UP THE ECONOMY, CAUSED UNTOLD HARM TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LOST JOBS, LOST HOMES, MANY PEOPLE LOST WEALTH.THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN  AND OUR MORTGAGE RULES WILL HELP SEE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
Jon: WHAT IS THE RESISTANCE TO A TYPE OF ACCREDITATION PROCESS LIKE THEY HAVE WITH A MEDICAL LICENSE, LIKE THEY HAVE WITH A DISBARMENT OF A LAWYER FOR FINANCIAL PRACTICES THAT ARE FRAUDULENT OR MISLEADING?
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY TALK ABOUT THAT AT THIS POINT.
Jon: REALLY, I JUST HEARD A GUY. [ LAUGHTER ]
I NOW HAVE HEARD -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY FEASIBLE BECAUSE I ALWAYS HEAR, "OH BANKING IS JUST TOO -- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND FINANCE AND BANKING, IT'S SO COMPLEX. BECAUSE MEDICAL SCIENCE, THAT'S SIMPLE." [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SOMEHOW IT'S ALWAYS PORTRAYED THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY HAD TO COMMIT THESE MASSIVE FRAUDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
I ACTUALLY THINK PEOPLE DO UNDERSTAND THE BASICS OF LENDING. THE TROUBLE IS IT BECAME SO COMPLICATED FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER, LOTS OF FINE PRINT, LOTS OF SURPRISES IN THERE. YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A DEAL TODAY, THIS IS HOW IT WAS EXPLAINED TO YOU, SIX MONTHS LATER IT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT, IT FEELS LIKE, AND THEN YOU'RE FAILING. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SIMPLIFY BANKING,  GET IT BACK TO BASICS ON THIS LENDING. BUT IN OTHER AREAS WE SEE ALL KINDS OF ABUSE OF CONSUMERS THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP. CREDIT REPORTING COMPANIES. MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH EFFECT THAT HAS ON YOUR LIFE,  WHAT'S IN YOUR FILE, WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE. WE HAD A FIELD HEARING IN DETROIT, AN ELDERLY WOMAN STANDS UP AND SAYS, I HAVE A  PROBLEM. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM MAM? THE CREDIT RECORDING COMPANIES THINK I'M DEAD. THEY HAVE ME DOWN AS DECEASED AND I CAN'T CONVINCE THEM OTHERWISE. HOW DO I GET THAT FIXED?
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:  WAS SHE? [LAUGHTER]
SHE SEEMED LIVELY TO ME. SHE CLEARLY FELT THEY VIEWED HER AS NOBODY AND THAT'S WHY  THEY WOULDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM AND THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT. THEY NEED TO FIX THESE ERRORS AND BE MORE RESPONSIVE.
Jon: ISN'T THERE A CERTAIN PURPOSEFUL OBTUSENESS TO THEIR DOCUMENTATION? THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT RED TAPE BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT IF YOU GET THESE PROSPECTUSES ON CREDIT CARDS AND THINGS, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY-- IT'S LIKE THE iTUNES AGREEMENT. THANK GOD THEY HAVE THE BUTTON WHERE YOU CAN JUST GO, I AGREE. CAUSE NOBODY IS GOING TO SCROLL THROUGH THAT. ISN'T THAT IN MANY WAYS PURPOSEFUL
THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ECONOMIC TERM FOR  THIS THAT YOU'L LOVE. IT'S CALLED CONFUSE OPOLY.
Jon: WHAT? IF THEY CAN CONFUSE THE CONSUMER ENOUGH, THEN THE CONSUMER WON'T   NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT CHOICE THEY'RE MAKING AND THEY CAN BE TALKED INTO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. THAT IS ACTUALLY A TERM THAT'S COME TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE GOBBLDYGOOK YOU GET IN THE FINE PRINT THAT LEADS CONSUMERS ASTRAY.
Jon: SHOULDN'T THERE HAVE TO BE, LIKE THERE WERE ON TAXES,  A SHORT FORM, OR SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY SPELLS OUT, AND WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO THAT?
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING TOWARD RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A NEW RULE IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET CALLED "KNOW BEFORE YOU OWE" THAT WILL SIMPLIFY THE TERMS OF THE MORTGAGE, POINT OUT THE PROMINENT THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW. YOU CAN IGNORE MOST OF THE REST OF IT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE KEY TERMS AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMPARE MORTGAGES ONE TO ANOTHER. WE THINK IF THE CONSUMER IS PUT IN THE POSITION OF KNOWING WHAT THE CHOICES ARE, AND IT'S TRANSPARENT, AND THEY CAN COMPARE,   THEN THEY CAN MAKE GOOD CHOICES. IT HAS TO BE THEIR CHOICE. I CAN'T MAKE IT FOR THEM, I HAVE CONFIDENCE THEY'LL MAKE IT RIGHT IF WE CAN MAKE THE MARKET WORK FAIRLY FOR THEM.
Jon: BECAUSE THE THING PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND ABOUT THOSE WHO VALUE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REGULATION IN THE MARKET, IS NOT ANTIFREE MARKET AND IT'S NOT ANTICAPITALISM, IT'S FAIRNESS. IT'S WANTING A CERTAIN SIMPLICITY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ABILITY. YOU ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE A LIFE. YOU HAVE KIDS AND A HOUSE AND THINGS YOU NEED TO DO.
WE KNOW HOW MUCH THAT CAN BE.
Jon: IT'S INCREDIBLY DISTRACTING. THAT'S WHY I WON'T TALK TO THEM. I GET HOME AND I HAVE A SMALL -- I GUESS WOULD YOU CALL IT A CHAMBER ROOM, AND I PUT ON A SUIT THAT MANY WOULD SAY LOOKS LIKE A DEEP SEA DIVING BELL PLAYS A VIRTUAL SCREEN OF ESPN AND -- WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU FEELING COMFORTABLE? ARE YOU FEELING LIKE YOU ARE MAKING HEADWAY?
I DO FEEL THAT, YES.
Jon: AND YOU'RE NOT GOBBLING IT UP WITH BUREAOCRACY AND RED TAPE,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CUTTING THROUGH IT,  WE HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH IT ALL THE TIME BUT IT'S GOOD WORK FOR US TO DO.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU SIR. RICHARD CORDRAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
