FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY  GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS WILL BE  JOINING US. MR. STEPHANAPOLOUS WILL BE OUT  HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. WE'LL TALK TO HIM VERY BRIEFLY  BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO BE UP IN  LIKE TWO HOURS. BIG NEWS FROM VATICAN CITY  TONIGHT.
POPE BENEDICT XVI ANNOUNCING  HE IS STEPPING DOWN AS LEADER OF  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
Jon: POPES CAN DO THAT? I ASSUMED THE PAPACY WAS LIKE A  LIFETIME COMMITMENT LIKE BEING  IN THE MOB OR BEING A CORRESPONDENT ON "60 MINUTES."  IN ANY CASE WE'LL BRING YOU FULL  TEAM COVERAGE OF THE POPE'S RESIGNATION IN "HOLY QUIT."  HOW IS IT GOING WITH THAT POPEY  CHANGEY THING? NOW, THE POPE HAS ISSUED A  STATEMENT CITING THE GROWING  TOLL OF HIS ADVANCED AGE LEAVING HIM ILL SUITED FOR HIS MINISTRY. BUT POPES USUALLY DON'T RETIRE  UNTIL THEY ARE CALLED BACK TO  THE HOME OFFICE. THIS HASN'T HAPPENED IN 600  YEARS. THE OBVIOUS QUESTION WOULD BE...
WHAT DOES A RETIRED POPE DO? 'S A RETIRED POPE TO DO?  DO RETIRED POPES DO? Jon: I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS  SCHOLAR BUT IF I KNOW ANYTHING  ABOUT RETIRED PEOPLE PROBABLY THE SAME AS WHAT THEY ALL DO. â™ª  WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DOES HE  DO? HE'S AN 85-YEAR-OLD. WHAT DOES HE DO? HE SITS ON HIS PORCH IN A TRACK  SUIT AND WRAP-AROUND SUNGLASSES  AND HE YELLS AT THE NEIGHBOR'S  KIDS. MAYBE HE PUTTERS AROUND IN  GARDEN WATCHING A LITTLE DAYTIME  TV AND SOMEONE NOTICES THAT THE MAIL HAS PILED UP FOR A COUPLE  OF WEEKS AND THE HOUSE IS ON THE  MARKET. THE CYCLE... YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO 85 YEAR  OLDS. WAIT FOR THE WHITE SMOKE TO COME  OUT OF THE CHIMNEY. BUT SINCE YOU BRING IT UP, WHAT  IS THE POPE'S PLAN
HE'LL DO WHAT HE'S BEEN  WANTING TO DO FOR A LONG TIME  WHICH IS TO READ BOOKS AND TO  PRAY.
Jon: ISN'T THAT WHAT THE POPE  WAS DOING? SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE ONLY THING  HE'S LOSING IN RETIREMENT IS THE  WAVING. LET'S GO LIVE TO SENIOR VATICAN  CORRESPONDENT IS A MAPT A BEE  WHO IS IN ROME RIGHT NOW. SAM, THANKS FOR JOINING US. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NICE TO SEE YOU IN ROME.
THANK YOU, JON. I AM IN ROME. I AM AT THE VATICAN
Jon: I CAN SEE THAT, SAM,  TERRIFIC. WE HAVEN'T SEEN A PAPAL  RESIGNATION IN 600 YEARS. WHAT HAPPENED HERE, SAM?
LET'S JUST SAY HE'S HAD A  CRISIS OF FAITH.
Jon: OH, WOW. SINCE WHEN?
WELL, HONESTLY, SINCE THE  WHOLE MANTI TE'O THING. THE POPE HAS JUST STARTED TO  QUESTION A LONG-TERM  RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE HE  TALKS TO ALL THE TIME BUT HAS NEVER ACTUALLY MET. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT MANTI TE'O THING  WAS ABSURD. THE GUY'S GIRLFRIEND DIES AND  THEN SUDDENLY COMES BACK TO LIFE  AND... OH!
THEY CHAT LIKE 100 TIMES A  DAY RIGHT BEFORE BED BUT NEVER  ON SKYPE OR FAITH TIME
Jon: FACE TIME  FAITH TIME. IT'S A VATICAN THING. IT'S LIKE CHAT ROULETTE BUT WITH  FEWER DONGS.
Jon: SHOULDN'T THAT BE NO  DONGS?
YES, JON. YES, IT SHOULD.
Jon: SO THE POPE IS RESIGNING  BECAUSE HE THINKS FOR THE PAST  SEVEN YEARS HE'S BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP NOT WITH JESUS BUT  WITH HAWAIIAN UBE PRANKSTER  RONAIAH TUIASOSOPO
YES, JON. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING. THE POPE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN  AGAIN. BESIDES, JON, THE CLUES WERE  ALWAYS THERE. ALL BENEDICT HAD TO DO WAS LOOK  UP.
Jon: LOOK UP WHAT? NO, LOOK UP. Jon: OH! IT CAN'T BE. SAM BEE AT THE VATICAN,  EVERYBODY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NOW, NEWS OF BENEDICT'S  DEPARTURE DID COME AS A BIT OF A  SURPRISE. FOR THE MOST PART THE POPE  PLAYED HIS RESIGNATION PRETTY  CLOSE TO THE VESTMENTS
THIS IS A DECISION, THIS HAS  ALWAYS BEEN A LOW-KEY POPE
Jon: YES, YES. A LOW-KEY POPE. AS TO THE PAST WILD MAN POPES  LIKE POPE AWESOME III. CAN A BROTHER GET AN AVA MARIA  UP IN THE BASILICA. PARTY POPE IS IN GOD'S HOUSE. ACTUALLY, THIS DOES RAISE AN  INTERESTING QUESTION. WHO MIGHT THE NEXT POPE BE? ONE ANALYST SUGGESTS HISTORY  COULD BE OUR GUIDE.
THE CHURCH, WHENNITY LECTS  POPES, HAS A HISTORY OF GOING  LONG POPE SHORT POPE LONG POPE SHORT POPE.
Jon: YOU ARE TALKING LENGTH  OF SERVICE, YES? FOR MORE, JOHN OLIVER IS GOING  TO BE THERE. OUR SENIOR CATHOLIC  CORRESPONDENT. HE IS ALSO IN ROME. JOHN, THANKS FOR JOINING US  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HI, JON. JON, HERE I AM ALSO DEFINITELY  IN ROME. EVEN THOUGH NEWS OF BENEDICT'S  RESIGNATION BROKE JUST THIS  MORNING I GOT ON A PLANE AND FLEW HERE TO ROME WHERE I  DEFINITELY AM.
Jon: THANKS FOR DOING THAT,  JOHN. I HEAR THAT THE VATICAN CULTURE  MINISTER IS UP THERE
HE'S 71, JON. HE HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF GOING  TO CHRIS TO HAVE SHOWNBERG.
Jon: THEY'RE GOING TO GO DUE  TONIC AGAIN
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [BLEEP] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
Jon: I FOLLOW MIGHTER  METRICS, MY FRIEND. IT'S MATH, OLIVER.
YOU DON'T FOLLOW [BLEEP], [BLEEP]
Jon: JUST BEFORE YOU WERE A [BLEEP]. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I HAD POSTERS ON MY WALL WHEN I  WAS A KID. LEO WAS THE CUTE ONE. CONSTANTINE WAS THE BAD BOY
I MUST HAVE MISSED THAT WHILE  I WAS PLAYING SPORTS AND GETTING  LAID. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jon: I PLAYED SPORTS. YOU'RE HALFWAY THERE  Jon: YOU'RE IN ROME. ANY INSIDE INFORMATION?
HONESTLY, I'M HEARING THE  NAME MITT ROMNEY FLOATED AROUND  A LOT.
Jon: ROMNEY? HE'S A MORMON
NO, HE WAS A MORMON. EASY INVOLVED ON THAT ISSUE.
Jon: INTERESTING. WHY DOES THE COLLEGE OF  CARDINALS LIKE SANTORUM AS WELL  AS GINGRICH, BACHMAN AND RICK  PERRY. THE ONLY PROBLEM THERE, OF  COURSE, IS THAT PERRY APPARENTLY  HAS TROUBLE REMEMBERING THE HOLY  TRINITY.
FATHER, SON, AND THE... WHAT'S THE THIRD ONE THERE? LET'S SEE.
YOU CAN'T NAME THE THIRD ONE? THE THIRD ONE, I CAN'T,  SORRY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: THAT'S JUST LAST YEAR'S  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HARDLY  IN THE RUNNING FOR POPE
I'M SORRY, JON. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WOULD WOULD THEY KNOW ABOUT  APPEALING TO A FLOUNDERING  ORGANIZATION DOMINATED BY OLD WHITE MEN CLINGING TO AN ARCANE  MORAL CODE WHO MUST RELUCTANTLY  EMBRACE CHANGE TO STAY RELEVANT? YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S NO CROSSOVER THERE AT  ALL, JON. NOT AT ALL. I'M JUST GOING TO GO, JON,  UNLESS I'M BEING SARCASTIC IN  WHICH CASE I THINK I'LL ACTUALLY STAY
Jon: IF THAT'S THE CASE,  JOHN, THE CHURCH NEEDS TO  REBRAND AS MUCH AS THE G.O.P. DOES. THEY HAVE TO GO LATINO. YOU'RE SAYING IT'S GOT TO BE  POPE RUBIO
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, JON. ALMOST HALF OF CURRENT CATHOLICS  LIVE IN LATIN AMERICA. THEY'RE BREEDING LIKE RABBITS. THEY CAN'T HELP IT. THEY'RE LITERALLY NOT ALLOWED TO  HELP IT. AND WHEN YOU COMBINE A RELIGIOUS  BAN ON BIRTH CONTROL, JON, WITH  THE FIERY PASSION OF THE LATINO CULTURE, AYE CARUMBA, JON, IT'S  MUY CALIENE
Jon: THE POPE WILL BE OKAY  WITH THIS?
MAYBE NOT, JON. LETS NOT RULE OUT WHAT VATICAN  WATCHERS ARE CALLING THE FULL  LENOSON AERO. BENEDICT STEPS DOWN PROMISING  HIS JOB TO A YOUNGER GUY. AFTER LOOKING AT A LOWLY FUTURE  WITH NO CHILDREN AND JUST HIS  HUGE COLLECTION OF POPE MOBILES FOR COMPANY HE COMES BACK A FEW  MONTHS LATER DEMANDING HIS OLD  JOB.
Jon: OR BENEDICT SAYS THE NEW  JOB CAN HAVE HIS JOB BUT HE  KEEPS ON BLESSING PEOPLE AN HOUR BEFORE HIS SUCCESSOR
EXACTLY, JON. IF THAT HAPPENS I'M GOING FULL  TEAM POPO OVER THIS.
Jon: POPO, PO
