FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, DO WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU  TONIGHT. MY GUEST   TONIGHT NEW YORK CITY  POLICE COMMISSIONER RAY KELLY IS  GOING TO JOIN US. AND AFTER THE SHOW, DIRECTLY  AFTER THE SHOW, HE AND I ARE  GOING TO GO ON THE ROOF OF THIS BUILDING AND WE'RE GOING TO  SUMMON BATMAN. ONLY THE POLICE COMMISSIONER  KNOWS HOW TO DO. THAT YOU SHINE A LIGHT AND  THEN -- [LAUGHTER] AS YOU KNOW, KIND OF A FUNNY  THING HAPPENED IN THIS YEAR'S  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AMIDST THE WORST ECONOMY IN DECADES, HIGH  UNEMPLOYMENT AND A STEEP  SPIRITUAL DECLINE, THE COUNTRY CHOSE NOT A SELF MADE AND  VIRTUOUS PATRIOT TO HEAL OUR  WOES -- [LAUGHTER] -- BUT THE SAME FOREIGN-BORN  SOCIALIST TYRANT WHO CREATED ALL  OF OUR WOES. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DID REPUBLICANS LOSE THIS  EMINENTLY WINNABLE PRESIDENTIAL  RACE? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS A  SERIOUS MESSAGING PROBLEM.
I THINK OUR MESSAGING HAS NOT  BEEN VERY STRONG.
THE MESSAGING WAS BAD.
Jon: MESSAGING. [ LAUGHTER ] IF ONLY PEOPLE KNEW WHAT THE  REPUBLICANS WERE ABOUT, WHAT THE  REPUBLICANS NEED IS SOME KIND OF 24-HOUR A DAY SEVEN DAY A WEEK  PERPETUAL MESSAGING REFINEMENT  AND DISTRIBUTION RESOURCE, PREFERLY ONE CLOSE TO THE  TRAPPINGS OF JOURNALISTIC  AUTHORITY BUT WITHOUT ANY  ETHICAL CONSTRAINT. WHAT WOULD WE CALL SUCH A PLACE? ELEPHANT NEWS IS TOO OBVIOUS? INSANE  CLONE POSSE IS  ALREADY -- INSANE CLOWN POSSE IS  ALREADY TAKEN. FERRET, FERRET NEWS! I'LL WORK ON IT. I'LL WORK ON IT. SO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE REPUBLICANS LOST NOT BECAUSE  OF POOR QUALITY OF THE IDEAS OR  THE JEB RELUCTANCE TO HELP GOVERN WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN  TOTAL COMMAND OR THE RAPIDLY  APPROACHING DEATH OF A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR VOTING BASE, NO. A MESSAGING PROBLEM. WHICH MEANS THERE'S BUT ONE MAN  WHO CAN SAME THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY NOW.
FRANK LUNDSTROM.
Jon: THE FAMED REPUBLICAN  SPIN DOCTOR CREDITED WITH  MASTERFUL MESSAGING AS CALLING THE ESTATE TAX THE DEATH TAX AND  MAKING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE  COVERAGE SOUND LIKE A (bleep)  SANDWICH. [LAUGHTER]
THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU USED  BEFORE, YOU ARE CALLING IT A  PUBLIC OPTION WHICH IS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE CALLS IT, ARE YOU  SURE IT ISN'T A GOVERNMENT  OPTION? IF YOU CALL THE THE GOVERNMENT  OPTION THE PUBLIC AGAINST IT.
GREAT POINT I'LL CALL IT THE  GOVERNMENT OPTION.
Jon: THANKS, FRANK. I'M GOING TO CALL HEALTH CARE  THE GOVERNMENT OPTION BECAUSE I  DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE IT. I APPRECIATE YOU TELLING ME HOW  TO (bleep) EVERYBODY OVER. THANK. WHILE THAT'S BEEN PERFORMED,EL  GOOD PEOPLE AT FERRELL NEWS  BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY. WE'LL START WITH REBRANDING THE  OR WE WILLAN PROCESS ITSELF.
YOU KNOW ABOUT WORDS AND  MESSAGING AND HOW TO DO IT,  FRANK. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THE NUMBER  ONE THING THE LANGUAGE ERRORS  YOU HAVE POINTED OUT VERSUS  ADJUSTMENT.
Jon: YOU SEE IT'S LANGUAGE  ERRORS. YOU NEED TO ADJUST YOUR LANGUAGE  ERRORS. I THINK THE CHURCH OF  SCIENTOLOGY CALLED, THEY WANT  THEIR DELIBERATELY OBFUSCATING WORDS BACK. THEY ARE NOT (bleep) YOU. THEY ARE ADJUSTING LANGUAGE  ERRORS. ELMERS GLUE USED TO BE THEIR  HORSE BOILING EM PORUM. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. SO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AT  STAKE. ERROR ME, AND ADJUST IT.
DO YOU BELIEVE THE ERROR IS  SMALLER GOVERNMENT. THE ADJUSTMENT SHOULD BE MORE  EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT  GOVERNMENT. WHY ARE THOSE WORDS SO MUCH MORE  IMPORTANT?
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  DON'T CARE WHAT THE SIZE OF  GOVERNMENT IS.
Jon: SEE, GRETCHEN IF YOU  SAY YOU WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT,  THE ELECTORATE REJECTS IT BUT IF YOU WANT IT TO FUNCTION MORE  EFFICIENTLY THE ELECTORATE LIKES  IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S CLEARLY NOT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. IT'S A POWER OF THE LANGUAGE. THAT IS WHY THIS IS CALLED A  BEARD AND NOT A CHIN-FAKING FACE  PUBE. I LIKE THIS GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] TO ME FAIR, IT WOULD BE CURLIER  IF THAT WERE THE CASE. LET'S PLAY ERROR AND ADJUSTMENT.
THE ERROR IS MEDICARE AND  SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE  ADJUSTMENT IS SAVE AND STRENGTHEN ENTITLEMENTS. I GUESS THAT SOUNDS BETTER.
Jon: IT DOES (bleep)  SOUND BETTER. IT DOES SOUND BETTER FOR THE  ACTUAL PLAN FOR ENTITLEMENTS  WHICH WOULD CUT THEM WHICH SOUNDS (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE KIND OF MESSAGING  STRATEGY THAT THE REPUBLICANS  HAVE HAD IN PLACE FOR YEARS. MAYBE THIS STRATEGY IS STARTING  TO HAVE DIMINISHING RETURNS. MAYBE THEY'VE HIT PEAK LUMPS. THERE'S ENDLESS RESERVE OF  WORD-IPULAITIONS HAS RUN ITS  COURSE. IS THERE A WAY TO GAIN  ADVANTAGE.
IT'S TIME FOR A NEW  REPUBLICAN THAT TALK LIKE  ADULTS.
Jon: LIKE WITH CURSE WORDS. LET'S GET THIS COUNTRY BACK ON  THE (bleep) TRACK! OH, YEAH I'M (bleep) BOBBY  JINDAL BITCHES. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WAIT, HOLD ON. I DON'T THINK I DID THAT RIGHT,  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE'VE GOT TO STOP BEING THE  STUPID PARTY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE  WAY YOU ARE JUST THE DESCRIPTION  OF THE WAY YOU ARE. INSTEAD OF COMING UP WITH  MESSAGING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE  THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE WOMEN'S HAVE BEGINAS HAVE BUILT IN  DEFENSE SYSTEMS THAT REPEL  ILLINOIS-GOTTEN SPERM WHAT COULD YOU TRY IS NOT BELIEVING THAT  WOMEN'S VAGINAS HAVE THAT  CAPABILITY. [ LAUGHTER ] MAKES ME WANT TO STROKE MY CHIN  PIEWBS. [ LAUGHTER ] A FUNDAMENTAL RETHINKING OF THE  MORE EXTREME AND INTERKUWAITED  THINKING THAT FORM THE BACKBONE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY PLATSFORM. ALL RIGHT. YOU COULD DO. THAT ANYBODY WITH A DIFFERENT  IDEA?
REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS IN KEY  STATES TO CHANGE THE WAY WE  ELECT THE PRESIDENT ARE APPROVED, THIS WEEK'S INAUGURAL.
REPEAT AFTER ME.
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND.
WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS: [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THE  ELECTRIC  ELECTORAL MATH IS SLIGHTLY  DIFFERENT BUT WHY DOES HE STILL GET MICHELLE OBAMA? THAT SEEMS -- [LAUGHTER] -- HEARD OF WINNER TALK ALL BUT  PLEASE S. SOME WOULD CALL A  PROPOSAL LIKE THAT CHEATING. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS, BUT  WHY NOT TAKE A PAGE FROM THE  PLAYBOOK HERE. THE LANGUAGE ERROR IS CHEATING. LET'S ADJUST THAT TO WINNING TO  PROCESS INNOVATION. ETHICS MODULATED DEMOCRACY  IMPROVEMENT. TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK AND  INTELLIGENCE, REALLY, TO REMAIN  STUPID. WE'LL BY RIGHT
