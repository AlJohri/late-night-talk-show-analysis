Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE HOST AND MANAGING EDITOR OF "TRAVIS SMILEY" ON PBS. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "DEATH OF A KING: THE REAL STORY OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S FINAL YEAR." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, TAVIS SMILEY! SIR! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?
I AM WELL, SIR. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: I AM DOING SO WELL. AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE.
Jon: "DEATH OF A KING." YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS BOOK. NOW, IT'S COMING OUT NOW IN SEPTEMBER. NOW I WOULD THINK GENERALLY THEY WOULD SAY, LET'S GET THIS OUT FOR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S BIRTHDAY, LET'S GET THIS OUT MAYBE ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH. WHY SEPTEMBER?
I THINK, WHAT I SAID IN THE INTRODUCTION IS, I SAY HIS MARTYRDOM HAS SOMEHOW MUFFLED HIS MESSAGE. SO IF YOU PUT THE BOOK OUT IN JANUARY, IT GETS CONNECTED AND CAUGHT UP WITH THE HOLIDAY. YOU PUT IT OUT IN FEBRUARY HE GETS BLACKENIZED. IF YOU PUT HIM IN FEBRUARY, AND HE'S MORE THAN JUST A BLACK FIGURE IN THIS COUNTRY. HE'S AN AMERICAN ICON AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND MAYBE EVEN AMERICA'S GREATEST DEMOCRATIC, SMALL D, PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL.  I DIDN'T WANT TO GET HIM BLACKENNIZED IN FEBRUARY. PUT HIM IN APRIL, PUT THE BOOK OUT IN APRIL WHEN HE'S ASSASSINATED THEN YOU GET CAUGHT UP AGAIN IN THE MARTYRDOM...
Jon: MARTYRDOM, RIGHT.
YOU PUT IT OUT IN SEPTEMBER, HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE AND THE SACRIFICE THAT HE MADE.
Jon: SO YOU'RE LOOKING TO TAKE AN AMERICAN ICON AND HUMANIZE HIM SO THAT THIS COUNTRY CAN HAVE A SERIOUS AND REAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ISSUES OF RACE AND MARTIN LUTHER KING. WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT WRONG. THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT WRONG. NOW I SEE THE PROBLEM. (LAUGHTER)
IMAGINE THAT...
Jon: IMAGINE THAT.
A SERIOUS CONVERSATION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT IS, I THINK IT'S FASCINATING TO ME, YOU KNOW, AS SOMEONE WHO ALWAYS ADMIRED DR. KING, WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT HE FOUGHT IT, THAT LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE, HE REALLY FELL UPON DIFFICULT TIMES FOR HIMSELF.
MM-HMM.
Jon: HE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST THAT DRIVE, IN A WAY. WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, I DON'T THINK HE LOST THE DRIVE.
Jon: RIGHT.
I THINK THE COUNTRY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH HE WAS TELLING BECAUSE THAT TRUTH, JON, MAY HAVE JUST BEEN TOO SUBVERSIVE FOR THE NATION TO HANDLE. I THINK IT'S TRUE WHETHER YOU'RE JON STEWART, TAVIS SMILEY OR ANYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE OR WATCHING TONIGHT, WE COME TO KNOW WHO WE REALLY ARE IN THE DARKEST AND MOST DIFFICULT DAYS OF OUR LIVES. SO IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW DR. KING AND YOU DON'T KNOW THE JOURNEY OF THE LAST YEAR, HIS SORT OF LAST MILE OF THE WAY, THEN YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW HIM BECAUSE WHEN KING COMES OUT AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM AND CALLS AMERICA THE GREATEST PURVEYOR OF VIOLENCE IN THE WORLD TODAY. THIS IS A BLACK MAN, EVEN WITH A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, IN '67 TELLING AMERICA YOU ARE THE GREATEST PURVEYOR OF VIOLENCE IN THE WORLD. AND THEN HE TALKED ABOUT THAT TRIPLE THREAT AS HE CALLED IT OF RACISM, POVERTY AND MILITARISM. AND THEN HE STARTS ORGANIZING A POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. AND SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY SAY TO HIM, NEGRO, WE TOLD YOU YOU COULD TALK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS BUT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. YOU DON'T TELL AMERICA HOW TO SPEND ITS FEDERAL BUDGET DOLLARS. BECAUSE KING WAS SAYING THAT WAR IS THE ENEMY OF THE POOR. THOSE BOMBS THAT YOU'RE DROPPING OVER THERE ARE LANDING IN THE GHETTOS AND BARIOS OF AMERICA, SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE TELLS THAT TRUTH? THE WHITE HOUSE, JOHNSON TURNS ON HIM THEY'D WORKED TOGETHER ON VOTING AND CIVIL RIGHTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT NOW HE'S AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR, AND JOHNSON DOESN'T LIKE THAT. SO THE JOHNSON WHITE HOUSE TURNS ON HIM, THE MEDIA TURNS ON HIM. WHEN YOU READ YEARS LATER, YOU READ NOW IN THIS BOOK WHAT THE "NEW YORK TIMES," THE LIBERAL "NEW YORK TIMES," THE LIBERAL "WASHINGTON POST," "TIME MAGAZINE" SAID ABOUT HIM IT'S EMBARRASSING. AND THE BLACK MEDIA TURNED ON HIM. SO, THE WHITE HOUSE TURNS ON HIM, THE MEDIA TURNS ON HIM, AND THEN WHITE AMERICA TURNS ON HIM. SO THE LAST POLL TAKEN IN HIS LIFE FINDS...
Jon: RIGHT.
THE HARRIS POLL, 75% OF AMERICANS THOUGHT HE WAS IRRELEVANT IN THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE. BUT HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT. ALMOST 60% OF BLACK FOLK THOUGHT DR. KING WAS PERSONA NON GRATA. HE COULDN'T GET HIS OWN ORGANIZATION SUPPORTING ON THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN. SO THIS IS A STORY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING WE DON'T KNOW. WHY? BECAUSE WE DEIFIED HIM IN DEATH, BUT WE DEMONIZED HIM IN LIFE. AND THIS STORY ABOUT KING, WE AIN'T COMES TO TERMS WITH YET. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WOW. I'M SORRY. I'M JUST GONNA, IF I MAY... SORRY, I'M JUST GONNA  END THE INTERVIEW NOW AND GO READ THIS. (APPLAUSE) THERE IS NO END TO THIS TYPE OF TRUTH BEING TOLD TO AMERICA THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR AND, SO, THE CYCLE CONTINUES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: THAT AT SOME LEVEL, TO ASK US TO FACE THE REALITY OF OUR PAST AND OUR HISTORY, WHILE STILL MAINTAINING ALL THAT YOU BELIEVE IS GOOD AND ENDURING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY, YOU WILL BE VILIFIED.
INDEED.
Jon: AND THE SAME GOES FOR TODAY AND ALL THAT HE HAD DONE WAS WASHED AWAY IN THOSE STATEMENTS.
WE SANG A SONG IN MY CHURCH, AND I DON'T MEAN TO PROSELYTIZE, BUT KING BEFORE HE WAS ANYTHING WAS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. HE WAS THE REVEREND DR. KING.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THERE'S A SONG WE SANG IN MY CHURCH GROWING UP IN A LITTLE SMALL TOWN IN INDIANA. "MUST JESUS BEAR THE CROSS ALONE AND ALL THE WORLD GO FREE? NO, THERE'S A CROSS FOR EVERYONE AND THERE'S A CROSS FOR ME." EVEN IF YOU'RE ATHEIST OR AGNOSTIC YOU UNDERSTAND THE POINT. WE ALL HAVE OUR CROSS TO BEAR IN LIFE...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE POINT IS THE MORE TRUTH YOU TELL THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO GETTING UP ON THE CROSS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO TELL US THE TRUTH. SO THIS BOOK, I THINK, AND I HOPE AT LEAST IS A CAUTIONARY TALE TO YOUR BRINGING UP A POINT, JON. A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR AMERICA RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, I SEE THEM ON YOUR SHOW EVERY NIGHT, WHO ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT AMERICA TODAY, AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND WE'RE TURNING A DEAF EAR.
Jon: RIGHT.
THE ISSUE OF POVERTY, WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THE DRONE PROGRAM ON STEROIDS, WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AGAINST ALL THE ODDS ARE TRYING TO GET US TO DEAL WITH INCONVENIENT, UNSETTLING, UNHOUSING TRUTHS EVEN RIGHT NOW THAT WE DON'T WANT THE HEAR. BUT KING'S LIFE POINTS OUT THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY FOR IGNORING SOCIETY'S TRUTH TELLERS.
Jon: WHY IS NOSTALGIA SUCH A POWERFUL ERASER OF THESE REALITIES?
BECAUSE IT'S SO...
Jon: WHY IS IT SO EASY TO ERASE THE REAL HISTORY OF THIS?
GREAT QUESTION. BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO CELEBRATE DEAD MARTYRS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HERE TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE. THEY'RE NOT HERE TO PUT THE TRUTH IN YOUR FACE.
Jon: WOULD HE HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE WAY THAT WE'VE DEIFIED HIM?
ABSOLUTELY, HE WOULD. IF HE WERE HERE RIGHT NOW,  HE WOULD CERTAINLY CELEBRATE BARACK OBAMA, THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT, BUT ON THIS DAY, SEPTEMBER 11, WHEN THE HEADLINE IN EVERY PAPER IN THIS COUNTRY IS WE'RE GOING TO START THIS ALL OVER AGAIN --
Jon: RIGHT.
START BOMBING AGAIN...
Jon: RIGHT. MY FRIEND, WILL YOU PLEASE STICK AROUND?
HAPPY TO DO IT.
Jon: WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE. THERE ARE THINGS GOING ON NOW IN THE COUNTRY THAT I'D ALSO LIKE TO GET TO BEYOND THAT.
HAPPY TO DO IT.
Jon: "DEATH OF A KING" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. CHEF RECOMMEND. TAVIS SMILEY, EVERYBODY. (APPLAUSE)
