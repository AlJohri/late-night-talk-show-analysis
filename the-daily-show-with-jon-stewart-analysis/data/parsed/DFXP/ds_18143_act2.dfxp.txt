John: WELCOME BACK. WELCOME BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE IS EXCITING NEWS COMING IN  FROM THE FUTURE.
IMAGINE TRAVELING FROM L.A. TO SAN FRANCISCO, 400 MILES, IN  JUST HALF AN HOUR.
John: OKAY, OKAY, DONE. I'M GOING TO IMAGINE IT RIGHT  NOW. OKAY. I'M IN LOS ANGELES. I'VE GOT AN AVOCADO WRAP AND A  JAMBA JUICE. I'M TALKING TO A PRODUCER WHO IS  BOTH A BIG FAN OF ME AND ALSO  DOES NOT KNOW MY NAME. NOW IT'S HALF AN HOUR LATER. I'M IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M  WISHING I HAD BROUGHT A JACKET  BECAUSE IT'S AUGUST AND IT'S ALWAYS [BLEEP] COLD THERE. I KNOW WHY YOU LEFT YOUR HEART  IN SAN FRANCISCO, TONY BENNETT. IT'S FREEZING AND IT WILL KEEP  IT ALIVE. BUT, LOOK. THIS SOUNDS LIKE EXCITING  TECHNOLOGY. SO WHAT IS THIS THING?
A REVOLUTIONARY  TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM CALLED THE  HYPER LOOP.
A PNEUMATIC TUBE THAT WOULD  CARRY PASSENGERS AS FAST AS 800  MILES AN HOUR IN ALUMINUM  CAPSULES.
John: AN 800-MILE-AN-HOUR  HYPER LOOP. YOU KNOW THOSE OLD OFFICE TUBES  THEY USED TO FIRE DOCUMENTS  AROUND IN, IN THE 1950s? WELL, NOW IMAGINE A MOUSE  CRAWLED INTO ONE OF THOSE TUBES. NOW IMAGINE THAT IT WASN'T A  MOUSE. IT WAS YOU. AND NOW JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX  IN THAT ALUMINUM CAPSULE AND  ENJOY A HALF AN HOUR OF THIS.
OH, MY GOD! John: LOOK, THE MORE  IMPORTANT POINT IS ASK  YOURSELVES THIS. IS THAT EXPERIENCE REALLY  SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN A  FLIGHT ON DELTA?
WHOA, DELTA! John: SO, WHO IS BEHIND ALL  THIS?
ELON MUSK THE TECHNICAL  GENIUS WHO INVENTED THE SPACE-X  PROGRAM, THE GUY BEHIND PAY PAL.
John: OH, YES, PAY PAL. IT'S THAT STERLING EXAMPLE IS  ANY INDICATION I'M SURE THAT  PASSENGERS CAN LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THEIR TRANSIT CAPSULES  FROZEN WITHOUT WARNING AND THEN  WAITING SEVERAL WEEKS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO EVEN  ACKNOWLEDGE IT.
PAY PAL! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: THAT IS LITERALLY TOO  KIND. THIS HYPER LOOP THING IS A HUGE  IDEA. BUT IS IT EVEN GOING TO WORK?
IT MAY SOUND CRAZY BUT  CONSIDER ELON MUSK'S TRACK  RECORD. THE 42-YEAR-OLD BILLIONAIRE WHO  FOUNDED PAY PAL INVENTEDDED THE  BREAKTHROUGH TESLA BATTERY CAR AND WAS THE FIRST TO DOCK A  COMMERCIAL ROCKET WITH A SPACE  STATION. THIS IS ELON MUSK THE  INSPIRATION FOR THE IRON MAN'S  TONY STAR CHARACTER.
John: WRONG AGAIN THERE IS NO  POSSIBLE WAY THAT ELON MUSK  COULD HAVE INSPIRED THAT CHARACTER BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN  1971 AND TONY STARK FIRST  APPEARED IN 1963. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THIS IS BASIC FACT-CHECKING. THESE KINDS OF MISTAKES HAVE TO  STOP. THIS IS A CATASTROPHIC ERROR. YOU'VE PUSHED ME TOO FAR. OKAY. I WASN'T EXPECTING QUITE SO MANY  PEOPLE TO EMPATHIZE. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME  HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY WORKS.
NOW LOOK THIS THING WILL  TRAVEL AT ABOUT 500 MILES AN  HOUR.
OKAY. THIS THING WILL TRAVEL AT  ABOUT... THAT'S A BULLET TRAIN,  150 MILES AN HOUR.
VERY FAST. THIS THING WILL TRAVEL AT  12,000 MILES AN HOUR.
AIRPLANES AND TRAINS AND  SHUTTLES. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
John: THIS IS HOW IT WORKS. THIS IS HOW IT WORKS. I AM A ROBOT. I AM A ROBOT. I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU TO SAN  FRANCISCO. EVERYONE IS DEAD. EVERYONE IS DEAD. SHOCK NATO. NOW IT'S A DANCE PARTY. OKAY. CLEARLY NO ONE IN THE MEDIA IS  ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS STORY. SO LET'S GO TO THE HORSE'S  MOUTH. LET'S HEAR IT STRAIGHT FROM THE  MUSK. WHAT IS THIS THING?
THIS IS A CONCORDE, A RAIL  GUN AND AN AIR HOCKEY TABLE.
John: OKAY. IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN A CONCORDE,  A RAIL GUN AND AN AIR HOCKEY  TABLE. THAT IS NOT AN EXPLANATION. THAT'S NAMING THREE THINGS THAT  SOUND FAST. IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN A  SPEEDBOAT, A CHEETAH AND GET YOU  TO DOHAR IN 15 MINUTES. ACCORDING TO MY CAL CUE LAYINGS  AN ACTUAL CROSS BETWEEN A  CONCORDE, AN AIR GUN AND AN AIR HOCKEY TABLE WOULD LOOK LIKE  THIS. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE AN  AMAZING WAY TO GET TO SAN  FRANCISCO. THE TRUTH IS, STORIES LIKE THIS  ARE ACTUALLY SOME OF MY  FAVORITES. THEY'RE INSPIRING BECAUSE THEY  REMIND US THAT THE FUTURE IS  GOING TO HOLD YOU AND EXCITING INNOVATIONS AND THE GREAT MINDS  IN OUR SOCIETY WILL ALWAYS BE  THERE TO PUSH US FORWARD. AND ACHIEVE THE UNIMAGINABLE.
MUSK SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE  TIME TO ACTUALLY BUILD HYPER  LOOP. HE'S HOPING OTHERS WILL MAKE HIS  DREAM BECOME REALITY.
John: WHAT THE [BLEEP]? THAT'S LIKE SAYING, HEY, YOU  KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO? FIND A VACCINE FOR CANCER. SOMEONE GET ON THAT. JUST THE IDEA IS MINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
