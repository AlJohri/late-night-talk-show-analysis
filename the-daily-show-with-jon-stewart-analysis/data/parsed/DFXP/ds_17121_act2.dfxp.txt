( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, TOMORROW THE BIG DAY WHEN THE SUPREME COURT WILL DECIDE WHETHER OBAMA'S HEALTH  CARE REFORM IS CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT. WHETHER--
WHOOO!
Jon:  WHOO, INDEED. WHETHER THE COURT RULES FOR OR AGAINST THE LAW, ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE--
THURSDAY IS SHAPING UP TO BE A BIG NEWS DAY.
WE'RE GETTING IT, THURSDAY IS THE DAY.
ALL EYES ARE ON THIS ONE.
THIS MASSIVE COURT RULING.
EXPECTED MONUMENTAL RULING.
IS IT OKAY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS?
SHOULD WE JUST SKIP WEDNESDAY AND GO STRAIGHT FOR THURSDAY?
WEDNESDAY IS TOTALLY WIPED OUT. THURSDAY IS THE ONLY IMPORTANT DAY OF THE WEEK. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  FIRST THINGS, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU BOTH LOOK EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE ON THOSE STOOLS. ( LAUGHTER ). AND, SECOND, YOU'RE GOING TO SKIP STRAIGHT TO THURSDAY. GEE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT USE FOR THE TIME MACHINE YOU APPARENTLY HAVE. I'M SORRY, KILLING HITLER WILL HAVE TO WAIT. ( LAUGHTER ) THERE'S A SUPREME COURT OPINION 24 HOURS AWAY. I CAN'T WAIT. SO WHO COOKED BLAME THE MEDIA FOR BEING PUMPED. JUST THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES.
THIS COULD BE A WIN-WIN FOR THE PRESIDENT.
WHATEVER HAPPENS IT'S A WIN-WIN FOR ROMNEY.
A WIN IS A WIN AND A LOSS IS A LOSS.
A LOSS COULD BE A GAIN.
IT'S PRETTY UNLIKELY THE COURT WILL STRIKE DOWN THE ENTIRE LAW.
THE COURT COULD DECIDE TO UPHOLD OR STRIKE THE ENTIRE LAW.
IT WILL BE A 6-3 DECISION--
IT IS KNOCKED DOWN 7-2.
I SAID 7-2, IT COULD BE 6-3, 8-1.
WILL HE JOIN TO MAKE IT SIX SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ONE OF  THOSE 5-4 RULINGS IN I DON'T KNOW.
Jon:  I DON'T KNOW EITHER. MAYBE THE CHIEF JUSTICE WILL KILL THE OTHER FOUR, OR A JUST WILL BE REANIMATED FROM THE DEAD  DEAD. OR ONE OF THE JUSTICES WILL BE IN A CAR CRASH AND THE OTHERS WILL SAY I CAN'T RULE ON THIS  JUSTICE, HE'S MY SON, BECAUSE THE JUSTICE IS A WOMAN. HA-HA! ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) IT'S ALL SO EXCITING! HOW WILL THE COURT DECIDE? FOR ANSWERS WE GO TO SENIOR JUDICIAL CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT. JESSICA! WOW! THIS IS SO EXCITING. IT'S LIKE WHOO! IS THERE ANY INDICATION HOW THE JUSTICES ARE LEANING TONIGHT?
LEANING? I'M PRETTY SURE THEY'RE HORIZONTAL, AS IN SLEEPING, BECAUSE IT'S NIGHT TIME AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT STUCK OUTSIDE OF AN  EMPTY-ASIS S BUILDING. DON'T WORRY, JON, WE'LL ALL KNOW TOMORROW MORNING.
Jon:  EXACTLY. IS THAT DEFINITIVE? WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCE SAYING? ARE THEY ON THE RECORD?
JON?" YEAH.
YOU NEED TO CALM THE ( BLEEP ) DOWN. WE'LL KNOW IN LESS THAN 12 HOURS.
Jon:  THERE HAS TO BE ADVANCE WORK, WHAT DO THE CLERK SAYS. OR THE WHITE HOUSE? THE PLACE SAY SIEVE. ARE ANY OF THE JUSTICES ON THE KILL LIST--
HOLD OJON, I AM GETTING BREAKING NEWS. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS IS ANNOUNCING A 7-2 DECISION THAT YOU NEED TO CALM THE ( BLEEP ) DOWN.
Jon:  SO TWO OF THE JUSTICES AGREE WITH ME, THEN. ( LAUGHTER ). JUST TELL ME THIS-- IF THEY DO OVERTURN OBAMACARE, WHO BENEFITS THE MOST, ROMNEY OR OBAMA?
I DON'T KNOW, JON! NOBODY KNOWS. THERE'S NO WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WITHOUT MAKE UP A BUMP OF ( BLEEP ) UP.
Jon:  THE RULING, THE EFFECTS ON THE CAMPAIGN WILL BE MEANINGLESS, TIME-KILLING ( BLEEP )?
YEAH, DUUH.
Jon:  DOUGH THAT, THEN.
OKAY, FINE. TOMORROW OBAMACARE WILL BE OVERTURNED HANDING THE ELECTION TO MITT ROMNEY.
Jon:  YES! THAT IS TOTALLY SPECULATIVE! I LOVE THIS!
AND THIS USHERING THE THOUSAND-YEARLING.
Jon:  YOU ARE OUT ON A LIMB.
WHAT WILL JESUS SAY ABOUT THE RULING?
HE WILL SAY AS HE SAID ORIGINALLY IN THE FIRST SERMON ON THE MOUNTAIN, MATTHEW 5:7. JON, CALM THE ( BLEEP ) DOWN! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DUDE!
Jon:  THANK YOU, JESSICA.
YOU WILL KNOW BY TOMORROW.
Jon:  THANK YOU,
