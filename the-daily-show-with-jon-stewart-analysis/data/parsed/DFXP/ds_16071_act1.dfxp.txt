-- RETURN TO, WITHOUTING ON THE THINGS I CARE ABOUT. I HAVE BEEN IN THE STORY A COUPLE OF DAYS NOW, HAVE GIVEN COMMENTS ON IT, THIS  IS A DISTRACK AND I'M TO THE GOING TO LET IT DISTRACT ME.
Jon: DISTRACTION? NO DISRESPECT, A DISTRACTION IS A CELL PHONE GOING OFF IN A MEETING. THIS IS LIKE HAVING AN INFLATABLE NOODLE MAN AT A BRIS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, YOU KNOW? (LAUGHTER) JUST SAYING. BY THE WAY, AUNT DORIS, AGAIN, I CAN'T APOLOGISE ENOUGH. SO-- THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE THE WHOLE AFFAIR FESTIVE. ANYWAY, THE CONGRESSMAN'S VOW OF ABSTINENCE FROM TALKING ABOUT THE SCANDAL--  (LAUGHTER)  WELL, HIS ABSTINENCE TALKING ABOUT IT LASTED LESS THAN 24 HOURS.
NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER SITS DOWN WITH NBC'S LUKE RUSSERT.
HERE NOW FOR THE INTERVIEW CONGRESSMAN WEINER.
I TALKED WITH CONGRESSMAN LATE THIS AFTERNOON.
DID YOU SEND THAT PICTURE TO THAT COLLEGE STUDENT IN WASHINGTON STATE.
I DID NOT.
Jon: BOOM! DONE! THANK YOU. A DIRECT ANSWER.
BUT YOU'RE NOT 100% SURE WHETHER THE PHOTO IS ACTUALLY YOU.
WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IS WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT WE'RE DOING AN INVESTIGATION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OKAY THAT LAST PART DIDN'T HELP. AN INVESTIGATION. YOU KNOW, I'M NO BIG CITY DETECTIVE BUT WHY DON'T YOU JUST CHECK INSIDE YOUR PANTS. (LAUGHTER) WHERE I BELIEVE YOU KEEP THE ITEM IN QUESTION. SERIOUSLY, AN INVESTIGATION? YOUR PENIS DIDN'T ROB THE BELLAGIO. (LAUGHTER) THAT WOULD MAKE SUCH A GREAT CLOONEY MOVIE. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU ARE SAYING A COUNTERFEIT PENIS BECAUSE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN  THAT SITUATION WAS ADD A WATERMARK.
WE WANT TO RESOLVE IT ONCE AND FOR ALL. WOULD YOU KNOW IF THIS IS YOUR UNDERPANTS.
THE QUESTION IS SHALL DID -- I APPRECIATE YOU CONTINUING TO FLASH THAT AT ME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE ONLY THING MORE AWKWARD THAN THAT INCIDENT WAS THE SCENE IN HOUR  EARLIER AT THE WASHINGTON D.C. KINKO HES, JAY, I GOT A BLOWN UP PHOTO OF A MAN'S  [BLEEP] READY FOR WOLF BLITZER. WOLF BLITZER, RUSH ORDER, 9 X 12 GIANT GLOSSY OF A  [BLEEP]. CUSTOMER NAME BLITZER, FIRST INITIAL W, WOLF BLITZER. I WON'T HAVE THE POSTERS UNTIL THE WEEKEND. (LAUGHTER) I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING, MAN, THIS WHOLE STORY IS A DRAG. I REALLY, I LIKE THIS GUY, I RESPECT THIS GUY. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS THE FULL DAILY SHOW TREATMENT.
THEN DON'T DO IT, JON.
Jon: WHO'S THAT?
