( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACTRESS--
ACCORDING TO YOUR DIAGNOSIS, IT'ST SEEMS TO COVER EVERYTHING FROM INSOMNIA TO TOOTH ACHE. IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A CATCH-ALL FOR DISSATISFIED WOMEN, WOMEN FORCED TO SPEND  THEIR LIVES DOING DOMESTIC CHORES AND THEIR SELFISH HUSBANDS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO  MAKE LOVE TO THEM.
YOU SEEM TO HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ON HUSBANDS FOR A WOMAN WHO DISTRIBUTE HAVE ONE.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, ASK YOUR PATIENTS.
Jon:  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) UH, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
Jon:  FIRST OF ALL, ARE YOU, AS ALWAYS, WONDERFUL IN THIS FILM. IT'S A WITTY FILM, BEAUTIFULLY DIRECTED. IT IS HILARIOUS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN FUN TO MAKE, EXCEPT FOR THE CORSETS.
YOU CAN'T TELL FROM THIS CLIP WHAT THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY ABOUT, THOUGH.
Jon:  OH, SHOULD I EXPLAIN VERY QUICKLY WHAT IT IS ABOUT OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO?
DID YOU SEE THIS ONE?
Jon:  "HYSTERIA?" I'VE SEEN IT TWICE.
I'VE BEEN ON THE SHOW SO MANY TIMES AND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THE MOVIES.
Jon:  IT'S THE ANIMATED PRINCESS WITH THE LONG HAIR WHO  LIVES IN A CASTLE AND SHE SINGS SOMETHING ABOUT--
I THINK I WOULD HAVE MADE A LOT MORE MONEY IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT THE INVENTION OF THE VIBRATOR ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WHICH FROM THAT CLIP IT LOOK  LIKEES --
Jon:  WOW. NO, NO, NO. HOLD ON. THAT HURTS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IN VICTORIAN--
IN IS VICTORIAN ENGLAND. THE INADVERTENT INVENTION OF THE VIBRATOR.
Jon:  THAT WAS A TIME WHEN MEN MADE THE DECISIONS ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE  WITHOUT HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE OR THE EMOTIONAL ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE-- IT'S A PERIOD PIECE.
THE ONLY PERK 100 YEARS AGO IS THEY WERE MAKING THEM ( BLEEP ).
Jon:  THEY WERE MAKING THEM DO THAT THING. ( LAUGHTER ). SO, SO, THE FEMALE-- WHAT HAPPENS-- ( LAUGHTER ) OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS A FICTIONAL  DEPICTION OF SOMETHING PEOPLE ACTUALLY--
IT ISN'T, ACTUALLY. IT'S BASED ON TRUE EVENTS THAT IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND, WOMEN WOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR  COMPLAINING OF SYMPTOMS THAT THEY WOULD CALL HYSTERIA, AND THEIR DOCTORS WOULD GIVE THEM  ORGASMS, SOMETIMES WITH A VIBRATOR.
Jon:  NOW THE VIBRATOR CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF NOT HAVING A POWER--  ( LAUGHTER ) OF THE, UH--
DISAPPOINTING DOCTORS I GUESS. DOCTORS WHO NEEDED A LITTLE HELP.
Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. IN A PRACTICE, LET'S SAY YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL, SEEING 12, 15 WOMEN  A DAY, BY THE END OF THE DAY--
WHAT COULD YOU BE AND I RECOLLECTED TO DO. THAT'S RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT THE INCREDIBLE HULK.
RIGHT.
Jon:  I THINK WE WOULD BOTH AGREE.
A LITTLE ELECTRICITY.
Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IN TERMS OF, OBVIOUSLY, AN ACTRESS' RESEARCH FOR THE ROLE-- ( LAUGHTER )  HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT-- YOU KNOW WHAT-- HOW IS YOUR BROTHER? FAMILY A GOOD. EVERYBODY'S GOOD? MAN.
I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE VIBRATORS IN THE MOVIE. UNFORTUNATELY. I'M THE-- I'M THE SUFFRAGETTE ON A BICYCLE.
Jon:  YOU WERELET MORE LIBERATED WOMEN.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN HYSTERIA. I UNBELIEVABLE ORGASMS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN GETTING THEM IN YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE.
Jon:  IF YOU ALL BELIEVE IN ORGASMS AND CLAP HARD ENOUGH-- WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF  THAT'S HOW IT WORKED? ACTUALLY, FOR ME, THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T BELIEVE-- THIS IS HOW MUCH YOU BELIEVE IN  THIS FILM-- YOU JUST HAD A BABY, LIKE, SEVEN WEEKS AGO, EIGHT WEEKS AGO. AND LOOK AT YOU. IT'S AMAZING. IT'S A WONDERFUL THING. CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.
WELL, THIS IS A FICTION. SOMEONE CAME OVER, PUT MAKEUP ON ME, DID MY HAIR AND PUT ON A DRESS AND I WALKED HERE. AND ACTUALLY --
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING, THIS IS THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH OTHER WHEN I'M DOING A SHOW I'M AN EIGHTH HERE. YOU SAW THE FIRST TWO ACTS. CLEARLY, THAT IS A MAN NOT PAYING ATTENTION. ( LAUGHTER ). NO, I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU COMING. I KNOW THAT IS A HUGE-- SO MUCH GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW  AND IT'S WONDERFUL THAT YOU'RE OUT.
I'M USUALLY IN SWEAT PANTS AND COVERED IN MILK. BUT... ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING. YOU JUST CREATED SO MANY NEW FAN SITES. "HYSTERIA" IS PLAYING IN SELECT THEATERS. YOU MAY SEE IT. IT'S WONDERFUL. SHE'S WONDERFUL IT. MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
