Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO AS PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PUSHING  FOR NEW GUN REGULATIONS, HE IS  STRUGGLING TO GAIN CREDIBILITY TO SKEPTICAL GUN OWNERS. IN A RECENT INTERVIEW WITH THE  NEW REPUBLIC MAGAZINE HE MOUNT A  FRONTAL ATTACK.
HE WAS ASKED IF HE SHOT A  GUN. HE SAID, YES WITH HIS GUESTS AT  CAMP DAVID HE GOES SKEET  SHOOTING ALL THE TIME.
Jon: YES, ALL THE TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CAN BARELY HEAR YOURSELF  THINK OVER ALL THE SHOOTING OF  SKEET. THIS SEEMS WRONG ON MANY LEVELS. FOR STARTERS HE APPEARS TO THINK  THE BEST PLACE TO REACH OUT TO  GUN OWNERS IS THE PAGES OF THE NEW REPUBLIC. A BIT OF A TELL I WAS TELLING MS  MAGAZINE THAT I LOVE NASCAR AND  I MYSELF DRIVEN MULTIPLE DODGE  CHARGERS. NOTHING WILL WORK. YOU'LL GET THIS EVERY TIME.
WE DO SKEET SHOOTING ALL THE  TIME. REALLY? ALL THE TIME?
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD  PRESIDENT OBAMA OWNS A GUN,  LIKES TO SHOOT AND SHOOTS ALL THE TIME.
DON'T YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT?
THERE ARE NO PHOTOS TO PROVE  IT.
WHY ARE V- WE NOT HEARD OF  THIS.
WHERE SAY PICTURE. THEY RELEASE A PHOTOGRAPH OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA DOING EVERYTHING  EXCEPT FOR FLOSSING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WHY WON'T THE BLACK  HAVE THE COUNTRY LIVES IN FEAR  OF RELEASE A PICTURE OF HIMSELF HOLDING A GUN? I DON'T UNDERSTAND, IT WOULD BE  EVERYONE AT EASE. WHY WON'T HE DO IT? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO BE CLEAR, THIS WILL IS  SKEET-GATE. CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT.
HOW OFTEN DOES THE PRESIDENT  GO SKEET SHOOTING AND ARE THERE  PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM DOING SO?
I WOULD REFER YOU TO HIS  COMMENTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN. HE DOES GO TO CAMP DAVID WITH  REGULAR LATER BUT I'M NOT SURE  HOW OFTEN.
Jon: IS THERE A PHOTOGRAPH  OF HIM DOING IT?
THERE MAY BE BUT I HAVEN'T  SEEN IT.
WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD ABOUT IT  BEFORE?
Jon: IT'S FUNNY YOU HAVEN'T  HEARD ABOUT IT BILLION BECAUSE I  IT FALSELY SHOWS HIM AS A GUN RIGHTS SYMPATHIZER SO WE CAN  ABOLISH LIBERTY AND I ASSUME --  BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CHECK ON THAT LAX LAUGH I DON'T GET  IT. BY THE WAY, WITH THE WHOLE DOES  HE SHOOT GUNS, DOES HE NOT  SHOOT? SINCE WHEN DID THE ABILITY TO  FIRE A WEAPON BECOME A BADGE OF  HONOR? A PATRIOTIC ACHIEVEMENT? ALL YOU NEED IS A FINGER. MERIT WISE IT RANKS RIGHT UP  THERE WITH THIS. THE POINT IS, MR. PRESIDENT,  WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY TRY. AS FAR AS MOST OF YOUR OPPONENTS  NOTHING WILL INGRATIATE YOU TO  THEM. AS SUMMED UP IN THE DR. SEUSS  CLASSIC OH, THE PEOPLE WHO HATE  YOU. MAY I? LET ME TURN OVER HERE. I GOT THIS:  THEY DO NOT LIKE  YOU BARACK OBAMA WHETHER ON A  TRAIN, A PLANE OR LLAMA. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY DO NOT LIKE YOU SHOOTING  SKEET, THEY DO NOT LIKE YOU  EATING MEAT. THEY DO NOT LIKE YOU DRINKING  BEER OR EVEN IF I ROPE A STEER. THEY WON'T LIKE YOU WITH THE  MONSTER TRUCKS BECAUSE, YOUNG  MAN, THEY DO NOT GIVE A  (bleep). THEY DO NOT LIKE YOU WHEN YOU  PRAY. THEY DID NOT LIKE YOU ANTI-GAY. THEY DO NOT LIKE YOU CUTTING  TAX. YOU COULD NOT STAND WHEN YOU WE  ARE YOUR MOMMY'S SLACKS. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU CANNOT REACH ACROSS THE  AISLE BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU DO  IS VILE. THEY COMPLAINED WHEN YOU KILLED  OWE PSALMA SO ON A TRAIN OR  PLANE OR LAMBA, ROLLING A 44 AT BOWL-A-RAHMA DESPITE YOUR NICE  WHITE KANSAS MAMA, COMMA, THEY  DO NOT LIKE YOU, BARACK OBAMA. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
