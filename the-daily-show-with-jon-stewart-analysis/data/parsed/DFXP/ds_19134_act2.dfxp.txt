Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW, IT TURNS OUT NEW YORK IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE DEALING WITH THE REGIONAL CULTURE SPECIFIC CRIME. JAPAN, WHERE ARTIST MEGUMI IGARASHI WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK FOR DISTRIBUTING PLANS TO 3-D PRINT MODELS OF HER OWN VAGINA, THUS BREAKING JAPANESE OBSCENITY LAWS. HUH? FIRST OF ALL, JAPAN HAS OBSCENITY LAWS? YOU ARRESTED HER FOR THAT? I MEAN, COME ON. YOU GOT HAVE A BACK-UP VAGINA IN CASE THE FIRST ONE CRASHES. IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE. IGARASHI'S CASE IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEW SEGMENT, "WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS BUT AT LEAST WE'RE NOT JAILING ARTISTS FOR 3-D PRINTING THEIR VAGINAS," BROUGHT TO YOU BY DECADES OF DEEP SEXUAL REPRESSION AND FISHCAKES. MMM. FISHCAKES. NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING, WHY WOULD SOMEONE SELL 3-D MODELS OF THEIR VAGINA? WELL, DUH.  [LAUGHTER] TO RAISE MONEY TO 3-D PRINT AN EVEN BIGGER MODEL OF HER VAGINA, SPECIFICALLY A VAGINA-SHAPED BOAT, WHICH IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IS ALSO THE PLOT OF "FIELD OF DREAMS." I NEVER SAW IT. AH MAYBE... NOW, IGARASHI HAS SINCE BEEN RELEASED FROM JAIL. BUT THAT'S NOT THE REAL STORY HERE. THE REAL STORY IS THAT THIS HAPPENED IN JAPAN, A COUNTRY WHOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING INCLUDES SUCH CLASSICS AS "GUYS IN THEIR UNDERWEAR SPINNING A GIANT WHEEL THAT SLOWLY UNDRESSES A WOMAN, AND WOMEN COMPETEING TO SEE HOW MUCH CHANGE THEY CAN HOLD IN THEIR CLEAVAGE." APPARENTLY THAT'S TOTALLY COOL. [LAUGHTER] INCIDENTALLY, JAPAN, CONGRATULATIONS ON INVENTING SOMETHING SOMEHOW MORE DEMEANING THAN ACTUAL PORNOGRAPHY. PLEASE TAKE THAT PICTURE DOWN BEFORE SOMEONE BUYS THE AMERICAN RIGHTS TO THAT SHOW. I DON'T GET HOW A COUNTRY CHEIFLY FAMOUS FOR SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGY, AND LET'S CALL IT CREATIVE SEXUALITY, HAS SEEN THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO TALENTS AND DECIDED, NO, THAT'S TOO FAR. ON THE JAPANESE PERVOMETER, THE VAGINA BOAT IS PRACTICALLY A DISNEY WORLD RIDE. BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULD SEE THE LINE AT THAT RIDE. [LAUGHTER] HERE'S WHAT REALLY GETS ME, JAPAN, IT'S NOT THAT I LOVE VAGINA-THEMED BOATS, ALTHOUGH, YES, I DO KEEP ONE DOWN THE SHORE. NO, WHAT GETS ME IS YOUR PUBLIC DISPLAY OF GENITAL DOUBLE STANDARD.
EVERY SPRING IN JAPAN, PEOPLE TRAVEL TO KAWASAKI FOR A FESTIVAL THAT IS LIKE NO OTHER. CALLED THE FESTIVAL OF THE STEEL PHALLUS. AS IN ERECT PENIS. THE FESTIVAL FEATURES PEOPLE MARCHING AND DANCING THROUGH THE STREETS, PARADING AROUND GIGANTIC PENIS SHAPED MIKOSHI.
Jon: LOOK, HEY, I UNDERSTAND THESE PENISES ARE PROUD OF THEIR CULTURE, BUT DO THEY HAVE TO BE SO LOUD AND HAVE A PARADE? COME ON. THAT'S MY NEW CHARACTER, GUY WHO IS PREJUDICE AGAINST PENIS CULTURE. JAPAN, YOU ARRESTED A WOMAN FOR 3-D PRINTING HER VAGINA, BUT YOU GAVE DICKS THEIR OWN HOLIDAY. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS IF YOU COMMUTE TO THE DONG PARADE IN YOUR VAGINA BOAT, YOU GO TO JAIL. WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST VAGINAS?
THE LEGEND GOES AS SUCH: A WOMAN HAD A DEMONIC PENIS-EATING VAGINA THAT REMAINED UNDEFEATED UNTIL A BLACKSMITH INVENTED AN INDESTRUCTIBLE IRON PHALLUS THAT SHATTERED THE DEMON'S TEETH. [LAUGHTER]
I COULD SEE HOW THAT WOULD LEAVE SOME ILL FEELINGS. ALL RIGHT. LOOK, JAPAN, I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU HOW THE RUN YOUR COUNTRY, BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY: AMERICA HAS A LONG TRADITION OF ALLOWING ITS FEMALE ARTISTS TO EXPRESS THEIR INNERMOST THOUGHTS. AND AS A RESULT, WE DON'T SPEND 51 WEEKS A YEAR STORING A GIANT STEEL DICK IN OUR GARAGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
