[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S TREMENDOUS ACTRESS IS. HER NEW NILSOME CALLED "GAME CHANGE."
ARE YOU 100% COMMITTED TO GOING FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT.
ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE OR SERVANT'S HEART AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I CAN HELP THIS TICKET AND THIS COUNTRY THEN  ABSOLUTELY I'LL DO THIS WITH YOU.
YOUR PRIVATE LIFE BE SUBJECTED TO HARSH OFTEN UNFAIR ATTACKS. NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU FOR HOW UGLY THIS CAN BE.
I DO UNDERSTAND HERE. HERE IS THE DEAL. I WENT THROUGH A TOUGH PRIMARY IN ALASKA AND I KNOW HOW UGLY IT ACCOUNT GET.
GOVERNOR THINGS CAN GET QUITE A BIT ROUGHER ON THE NATIONAL STAGE.
I DON'T KNOW ALASKA IS PRETTY ROUGH.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM JULIANNE MOORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER -- THIS IS A PERSON THAT IS STILL ALIVE.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: IS THAT A LOT HARDER TO PORTRAY -- WHEN YOU ARE IN LIKE A JOHN ADAMS MINI SERIES.
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT NO ONE REMEMBERS HIM.
Jon: SURE. BUT THIS IS FRESH IN PEOPLE'S MINDS.
A LIVING FIGURE IS ONE THING AND THEN A LIVING HISTORICAL FIGURE IS ANOTHER AND A LIVING  HISTORICAL CULTURAL IMPORTANT FIGURE. SHE'S SO PRESENT IN PEOPLES MINDS.
Jon: AND DIVISIVE. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN GO D'OH TO WIN ON THAT ONE.
SO POLARIZING.
Jon: IT BRINGS UP THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO REALLY KNOWS HOW TO ACT, LIKE AN  ACTRESS AND, YOU KNOW, ME --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- IS IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE THAT A CHARACTER TOUR. CAN I DO MY JOE LIEBERMAN FOR YOU.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
Jon: CLOSE YOUR EYES. EVERYBODY VOTE FOR ME. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THAT --
THAT WAS DEAD ON.
Jon: RIGHT? HOW DO YOU CRAFT IT TO AVOID CARICATURE BUT STILL CAPTURE THE TICKS, THE ESSENCE?
THANK YOU FOR THINKING THAT I DID. FIRST OF ALL.
Jon: I SAY THAT FROM SOMEBODY WHO WATCHED IT.
OKAY IT'S -- IT WAS A REALLY CHALLENGE. IT WAS A HUGE CHALLENGE. I'M NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO BECOME THAT PERSON THAT PERSON EXISTS. I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH. I LISTENED TO HER VOICE. EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED. IT'S OUT ON YOUTUBE.
Jon: HOW DID YOU GET THAT? LOGGED ON TO YOUTUBE, HUNG OUT.
I WENT YOUTUBE-ING THIS AFTERNOON FOUND OUT A FEW THINGS.
Jon: CATS CAN PLAY PIANO.
I READY HER BOOK. RED BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT HER. I JUST KIND OF GATHERED UP ALL THIS RESEARCH WORK WITH A VOCAL COACH.
Jon: THE ACCENT IS WEIRD ONE FOR ME. I'VE BEEN TO LK ALASKA THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE THANK THEY DO NOT. I WATCHED HER REALITY SHOWS, TOO. SHE SPEAKS MOST LIKE HER FATHER. SEEMS BASED ON THE IDAHO ACCENT BUT SHE TAKES IT FURTHER THAN HE DOES. IT'S HER OWN PARTICULAR WAY OF SPEAKING.
Jon: I LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN BREAK IT DOWN IT'S THE IDAHO ACTION. I NEVER WOULD HAVE --
THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM AND SHE HAS A PARTICULAR RHYTHM. SOMETIMES SHE ADD A PREPOSITION. INSTEAD OF GO OUT SHE SAYS TO GO OUT. YOU HEAR THAT RHYTHM AGAIN AND AGAIN.
Jon: LET ME TRY, LET ME TRY. VOTE FOR ME --  [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF AN EAR.
YOU HAVE AN EAR.
Jon: I HEARD IT A LITTLE BIT UNTIL THERE. THAT WAS A LITTLE WYE WIE, I THINK.
TREMENDOUS MUSICALITY.
Jon: KINDEST THING I HEARD ALL WEEK. HOW TEMPTING WAS IT -- SHE'S GOING TO HATE THIS. HOW TEMPTING WAS IT TO PICK UP THE PHONE THOUGH. SHE'S GOING TO HATE IT AND THINK TO HERSELF KUDOS TO JULIANNE MOORE FOR A STUNNINGLY AUTHENTIC  AK -- ACCENT. WERE YOU TEMPTED TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND WRITE A LETTER OR SAY NOTHING PERSON OR IS THERE  ANYTHING YOU WANT TO AD.
MY WONDERFUL DIRECTOR -- HE'S HERE IN THE AUDIENCE. WHERE IS HE? NOT HERE? THERE HE IS. THERE HE IS, OKAY.
Jon: HI, JAY.
HE REACHED OUT TO SARAH PALIN BEFORE WE COMMENCED AND THEY SAID NO INVOLVEMENT.
Jon: DID THEY EMPHASIZE THE PREPOSITION? HOW DID THEY -- WAS THAT (bleep) IN THERE? (bleep) NO.
OR WAS IT THE YOU? THAT'S RIGHT. THE OTHER ACTORS ARE OFF PLAYING. IT'S HARD NOT TO CONCEIVE THIS AS LOOK AT US WE'RE ALL PART OF  THE LIBERAL ELITE CONSPIRACY.
NO WAY.
Jon: WHEN YOU WERE ON THE SET HOW DID THAT PLAY ITSELF OUT?
MAYBE THE PART WHERE SHE KILLS THE BEAR WITH HER HANDS --
WE WERE VERY, VERY CAREFUL TO PORTRAY BE AS BALANCED AS POSSIBLE. DANNY STRONG WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT BEAUTIFULLY I MIGHT ADD SOURCED EVERYTHING. HE SPOKE TO EVERYBODY. WE TRIED TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE TO PRESENT THE REAL HUMAN CONNONE DRUM. THIS IS LESS OF A STORY ABOUT SARAH PALIN ABOUT THOSE 60 DAYS BETWEEN HER PICK AND THE LOSS. WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TELL THAT STORY. IT IS HOW DO WE CHOOSE OUR LEADERS. WHY IS IT WE'RE SO DRAWN TO MAGNETISM, CHARISMA, GOOD LOOKS THAT MOVIE STARS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. DO OUR LEADER NEED TO HAVE THOSE, TOO.
Jon: I LIKE THE WAY YOU ARE LOOKING AT ME WHEN YOU ARE SAYING THAT. IF I CLOSE MY EYES FOR A SECOND, CAN I PRETEND YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ME. DO IT IN THE SARAH PALIN VOICE, IF YOU WOULD. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I HAVE TOLL TELL YOU, THOUGH I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH YOU. EVERYTHING I SEE YOU IN. IT'S IMPRESSIVE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND THAT LINE.
THANK YOU. IT'S A TRULY INTERESTING STORY. IT REALLY IS. LIKE I SAID IT'S UNBELIEVABLY TRUE.
Jon: AND IT'S ON HBO WHICH IS NOT TV BUT HBO. GAME CHANGE IS SATURDAY
