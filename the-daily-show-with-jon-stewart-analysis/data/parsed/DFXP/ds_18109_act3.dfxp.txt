( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT PRODUCED AND  DIRECTED THE NEW HBO DOCUMENTARY  FILM, "PUSSY RIOT, A PUNK PRAYER."
Jon:  I BELIEVE THAT'S  FROM TAYLOR SWIFT'S NEW ALBUM. ( LAUGHTER )  THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. EXPLAIN JUST VERY QUICKLY THE  PARAMETERS OF WHAT PUSSY RIDE IS  IN & HOW THEY GOT IF TROUBLE IN PUTIN'S RUSSIA.
THEY'RE FEMINISTS,  PERFORMANCE ARTISTS WHO TAKE ON  THE GUISE OF A PUNK ROCK BAND AND STAGE GORILLA PERFORMANCES  IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS. WE SAW THEM IN RED SQUARE AND  THE ONE THAT GOT HEM IN TROUBLE  WAS THE RAUCH'S BIGGEST ORTHODOX  CATHEDRAL.
THE HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN  CHURCH DECIDED THEY COMMITTED  THIS MASSIVE OFFENSE AGAINST THE RELIGION ITSELF AND PUSHED FOR  THIS CASE TO BECOME A CRIMINAL  CASE. IT ENDED UP BEING ONE OF THE  REALLY MAJOR CAESES OF THE  DECADE. AND IT RESULTED IN PRISON  SENTENCES FOR THREE OF THE  WOMEN. ONE OF THEM HAS SUBSEQUENTLY  BEEN RELEASED ON APPEAL BUT TWO  OF THEM ARE SERVING TWO YEARS IN PENAL COLONIES IN RUSSIA. BOTH HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN. AND THE THE STORY HAS MUST HAVE  BEEN ROOMED BEYOND ANYONE'S  BELIEFS.
Jon:  AMERICANIZED,  WESTERNIZED WORK SEE THEIR  DEMONSTRATION AS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ACCEPTED AND  ALMOST, FOR OUR AUDIENCES,  SOMEWHAT ROUTINE TO SEE THAT TYPE OF PROTEST. THE IDEA THAT-- AND THEY ONLY  PLAYED FOR ABOUT 40 SECONDS, YOU  SAY, IN THE CHURCH? THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE TWO  YEARS OF HARD LABOR IS REALLY  HARD TO FATHOM.
WELL, IT'S PART OF A NEW SORT  OF RETURN TO THE OLD BAD DAYS OF  ANTI-DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA. THE LAST SIX MONTHS SINCE  PUTIN'S RETURN TO POWER THEY'VE  INTRODUCED A NUMBER OF CLEARLY DRAMATICALLY-- THE PUSSY RIGHTS  CASE REPRESENTS THIS RETURN NOT  QUITE TO STALINISM BUT THE RETREAT FROM PROGRESS THAT HAD  BEEN MADE TOWARDS DEMOCRACY GLI  NEVER THINK OF RUSSIA IN THOSE TYPES OF-- IT'S SOMETHING YOU  MIGHT IMAGINE FROM MORE OF A  THEOCRATIC STATE, THAT TIECH PUNISHMENT FOR THAT TIECH  BEHAVIOR. AND THEY SEEM, IF I MAY,  INCREDIBLY APPEALING. THERE'S A PLAYFUL QUALITY TO IT  THAT I WOULD IMAGINE IF THAT'S  IMPEDED IN RUSSIA WOULD GET THE PEOPLE UP IN ARMS BUT THAT  HASN'T BEEN THE CASE.
NO, I THINK THAT HASN'T BEEN  THE CASE, AND THERE HAS BEEN A  LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR  PUNISHMENT. PART OF IT IS THE LEGACY OF JUST  PUNISHING HOOLIGANISM WITH JAIL  SENTENCE AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS TAKE A WHILE TO ADAPT. I THINK THE OTHER THING WAS  THERE WAS THIS MASSIVE MOVE BY  THE CHURCH TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF THESE WOMEN, AND SO I  THINK THAT GOT THE  FUNDAMENTALISTS UP IN ARMS WHO  HAD BEEN REPRESSED FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT THIS SEEMED LIKE AN  OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. AND EVEN TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY  JUST PASSED A BLASPHEMY LAW  WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE "PUSSY RIOT LAW" MAKING WHAT  THEY DAY CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
Jon:  WHAT I DON'T  UNDERSTAND, THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX  CHURCH'S HISTORY OF BEING REPRESSED IS VERY RECENT. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING 300 YEARS  AGO WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TALK  ABOUT OUR RELIGION. UNDER STALINISM THEY SUFFERED  GREATLY. HAVE THEY FORGOTTEN THE LESSONS  OF THAT OR HAVE THEY THOUGHT,  YEAH, IT WAS WRONG TO OPPRESS US BUT WHEN WE DO IT, IT ACTUALLY  FEELS KIND OF NICE.
I THINK THEY WERE THREATEN  BIDE THE FEMINISM AS WELL. THE FEMINIST MESSAGE THE WOMEN  HAVE. ESPECIALLY THE CHURCH BECAUSE  IT'S A PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION.
Jon:  RUSSIAN WOMEN ARE  TRADITIONALLY A STRONG GROUP. THEY'RE NOT WALLFLOWERS.
THAT'S TRUE. ( LAUGHTER )
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO  UNDERSTAND THIS RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND STATE AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE PUSSY  RIOT PROTEST WAS ABOUT. IT WASN'T AN ATTACK ON RELIGION  ITSELF BUT THE RELIGION IN MANY  WAYS HAS BECOME A SIM BOFL EXTREME NATIONALISM IN RUSSIA  AND SOMETHING PUTIN HAS PROMOTED  AND FINDS VERY USEFUL. THE RUSSIAN POPE SAID PUTIN'S  RETURN TO POWER OF A MIRACLE  FROM GOD AND URGED ALL SUPPORTERS-- ALL BELIEVERS TO  VOTE FOR HIM.
Jon:  NOW, DOES HE KNOW  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MIRACLE  AND JUST SLIGHT VOTING  IRREGULARITY? HAS HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN ANY  WAY? NOW, IS THERE ANY WAYUE KNOW,  IT'S VERY DILL-- THERE ARE SOME  POLITICAL REGIMES THAT ARE OPPRESSIVE BUT RESPONSIVE TO  OUTSIDE PRESSURE, STILL CARE  ABOUT-- IS THERE ANY WAY TO SHAME PUTIN. THIS IS A GUY WHO HUNTS SEALS IN  A CROSSBOY WITH NO SHIRT ON. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD SHAME  THAT GUY INTO EASING WHAT IS AN  UTTERLY RIDICULOUS DRACONIAN  PUNISHMENT?
OF COURSE A LOT OF MAJOR  MUSIC ARTISTS HAVE COME IN  SUPPORT OF THE PUSSY RIOT, MADONNA AND YOKO ONO--
I'M SORRY, YOU SAID MAJOR?
I UNDERSTAND HE'S A VERY --
MADONNA SLAM! ( LAUGHTER )
BUT HE'S A BIG DIRE STRAIGHTS  FAN. IF HE CAME OUT --
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
AND A BIG DEEP PURPLE FAN.
THAT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WE DON'T KNOW.
Jon:  WHAT IS WITH THE  ECCENTRICITY OF THESE DICTATORS. KIM JUNG UNHAS A REAL WEAKNESS  FOR THE "POLICE ACADEMY" MOVIE. THERE IS ALWAYS SOME CRAZY  OFFSHOOT OF SOMETHING-- I MEAN,  WE SENT DENNIS RODMAN TO NORTH KOREA, FOR GOD'S SAKES. I'M SURE WE COULD GET NOFLER TO  DO SOMETHING.
MAKE IT HAPPEN.
Jon:  FOR REAR FOR REAL? ( LAUGHTER )
I THINK A LOT OF TIME THE  JUDICIARY IS ANNOYED BY THE  MORALIZING OF TELL US WHAT TO  DO. WE GET THIS QUESTION A LOT, AND  IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WHETHER  EYE THINK IT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO HAVE THE  SUPPORT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD  AND FOR THEIR CAUSE BUT HOW IT IMPACTS THE JUDICIAL PROCESS --
SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR TO US  SAY, BOY, WE'D LOVE TO SUPPORT  THESE WOMEN BUT IT'S TENUOUS BECAUSE THAT COULD ALSO BE SEEN  AS ARROGANCE FROM THE WEST AND  THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT GET US IN TROUBLE AS WELL.
INITIALLY, THIS WAS  CHARACTERIZED AS WESTERN  FOUNDED, WHICH IT WASN'T. IT WAS VERY EASY TO LABEL IT AS  SUCH. AND I THINK THE MORE YOU PUSH  AND THE MORE-- YOU KNOW, THERE'S  A GREAT RESISTANCE TO BEING LECTURED BY THE WEST.
Jon:  TRUTH BE TOLD, WE  CAN BE DICKS. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT IT'S GREAT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE  DOING AND I REALLY HOPE THEIR  STORY GETS OUT AND I HOPE THEY'RE OUT SOON. "PUSSY RIDE" PREMIERES ON HBO,  JUNE 10.
