EVERYBODY. WE'RE HERE WITH PINK. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU VERY  MUCH, BOTH YOU AND THE WHOLE  BAND THAT. WAS INCREDIBLE.
IT'S OUR PLEASURE. THANKS FOR HAVING US. WE LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE  FOR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS SAID IF I  COULD JUSTIFIED SOME PEOPLE TO  LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF ME, I'D BE  A HAPPY, HAPPY MAN. NOW, THIS THING, SO THE NEW  ALBUM CAME OUT YESTERDAY. I SHOULD SAY DROPPED YESTERDAY. THAT'S A MUSIC TERM. I DON'T WANT THE BLOW YOUR MIND,  BUT DROPPED YESTERDAY. SO KIDS CAN PICK UP THE L.P., IS  THAT THE WRONG WORD?
YEP, THAT'S NOT IT.
THE WAX DISC, IS CYLINDER? I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE NUMBER  ONE, A SMASH HIT. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS  THING, SMASH HIT. JUST THE CONSISTENCY. HOW MANY ALBUMS IS THIS NOW?
THIS IS THE SIXTH STUDIO  ALBUM.
Jon: INCREDIBLE.
I'M LIKE A RASH. YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ME.
Jon: STOP IT. CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT THE [BLEEPED] KICKED OUT OF ME BY A  RASH. HOW DID THIS DEGENERATE? THIS IS A CLASSY PROGRAM. THE C.D., THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE,  ON SALE NOW. YOU GOT TO GET THIS.
