Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT BEST SELLING AUTHOR HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE PRICE OF SILENCE. THE DUKE LACROSSE SCANDAL, THE POWER OF THE ELITE AND THE CORRUPTION OF OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM WILLIAM COHAN, COME ON OUT HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
Jon: WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME SO WE'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT TO IT. WHAT DO YOU WANT DEAL WITH FIRST IN THE PRICE OF SILENCE? THE DUKE LACROSSE SCANDAL, THE POWER OF THE ELITE OR THE CORRUPTION OF OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES?
WELL, I MEAN THEY ALL GO TOGETHER. THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BOOK IS THAT THEY DO ALL GO TOGETHER IN WAYS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE MAY NOT HAVE ANTICIPATED WHEN WE SEND OUR KIDS OFF TO COLLEGE THINKING THEY ARE GOING TO GET A GREAT EDUCATION.
Jon: IS THAT THOUGH JUST REFLECTIVE OF THAT DIVIDE IN SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. THIS IDEA DUKE IS, YOU KNOW, SORT OF AN ENCLAVE OF MORE WEALTH AND MORE PRIVILEGE THAN IT'S SURROUNDINGING TOWN. IS IT A MICROCOSM THOUGH OF A LARGER ISSUE IN THE COUNTRY?
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT NCAA DIVISION I ATHLETES ARE PUT ON A PEDESTAL IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'RE DEALING IN REALTIME. WE HAVE THE NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM THAT IS THINKING ABOUT UNIONIZING AND INCREDIBLY SOME OF THE ALUMNI ARE SAYING MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO DO. YOU'VE GOT THE JAMEIS WINSTON STORY AT FLORIDA STATE. YOU KNOW, WHETHER OR NOT THAT INVESTIGATION WAS BOTCHED OR NOT. THERE'S INCIDENTS AT VANDERBILT AND THE NAVAL ACADEMY. THESE ARE HAPPENING ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY.
Jon: AREN'T THEY ALSO HAPPENING OUTSIDE -- WE CERTAINLY JUST CAN'T ASSUME THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT OR IN THIS CASE THEY WERE EXONERATED BUT THAT THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES ARE SOMEHOW RELEGATED TO THE UNIVERSITIES. IT'S A PROBLEM IN SOCIETY.
AS MOST PROBLEMS ARE. I MEAN, UNIVERSITIES ARE MERELY A MICROCOSM, IF I MAY USE THAT WORD.
Jon: YEAH.
OF LARGER  ISSUES IN SOCIETY. WHY THIS BECAME SUCH AN AMAZING STORY. I MEAN REALLY IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN ITS SCALE AND THE MEDIA ATTENTION IT FOCUSED. THESE KIDS JUST THOUGHT WE'LL HAVE A PARTY WHERE WE'LL JUST DRINK ALL DAY. THERE MIGHT BE UNDERAGE DRINKING GOING ON AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A GREAT IDEA OF INVITING STRIPPERS TO COME TO OUR HOUSE INSTEAD OF GOING TO A STRIP CLUB WHICH WE USUALLY DO AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEIR WHOLE LIVES ARE UPSET FOR CERTAINLY THE NEXT 15 MONTHS OF THIS SITUATION BEFORE THEY WERE DECLARED INNOCENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA BUT THEIR LIVES ARE AFFECTED FOR THE REST OF LIVES.
Jon: IT'S SO TAILOR MADE FOR WHAT OUR MEDIA ENJOYS MORE THAN ANYTHING WHICH IS SENSATIONALIZED CONFLICT. WHITE KIDS RICHER KIDS AT A PRIVILEGED UNIVERSITY, A WOMAN OF LESSER PRIVILEGE. THIS IS THE PERFECT STORM FOR THEM IN TERMS OF GENERATING SOMETHING. UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR THEM IN THAT SHE WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD EXEMPLAR OF DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.
NOBODY COVERED THEMSELVES WITH ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE GLORY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THERE WERE NO HEROES HERE. BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY OF THE WAY JUSTICE CAN BE SUBVERTED. BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER A TRIAL HERE. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, ELIZABETH WARREN WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS THE OTHER NIGHT ON YOUR SHOW, ABOUT HOW MONEY AND POWER CONTROL WASHINGTON. WE KNOW BECAUSE I WROTE THE BOOK ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS THAT MONEY AND POWER CONTROL WALL STREET. NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, OR MAYBE NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF HOW MONEY AND POWER CAN OFTEN SUBVERT JUSTICE. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TRIAL HERE.
Jon: BUT IS THIS A GOOD CASE OF THAT? I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT CERTAINLY MONEY AND POWER CAN SUBVERT JUSTICE. AND WE HAVE ATWO TIER SYSTEM. AND YOUNG MINORITIES GOES TO JAIL FAR MORE FREQUENTLY AND FOR FAR LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD. BUT IS THIS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT PARTICULAR CORROSION IN OUR SOCIETY?
IT MAY BE ONE OF FEW EXAMPLES OF THAT PARTICULAR CORROSION IN OUR SOCIETY. BECAUSE DON'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THREE KIDS WERE INDICTED. THE WOMAN WHO ACCUSED THEM OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT SHE PROVED TO BE A LESS THAN RELIABLE WITNESS. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, HOWEVER, BELIEVED HER, BELIEVED THE NURSE THAT EXAMINED HER AND BELIEVED THE POLICE THAT INVESTIGATED. THERE WAS NEVER A TRIAL. HE WAS BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES BEFORE THE STATE BAR. HE WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO BRING THIS CASE TO TRIAL BECAUSE THE DEFENSE WHO DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB, THEY WERE ABLE TO EXPLOIT EVERY ONE OF HIS MISTAKES OF WHICH THERE WERE MANY. THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK.
Jon: BUT, THAT'S MY POINT. IF HE WERE,  IF HE HAD NOT MADE SO MANY MISTAKES. IF SHE WAS A MORE CREDIBLE WITNESS. IF THERE WAS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT MATCHED HER STORY AND THEN THEY GOT OFF BASED ON A SUBVERSION OF JUSTICE BY A POWERFUL DEFENSE TEAM, I THINK YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ONE OF THOSE MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY AT THE END LIKE NOW IMAGINE SHE'S BLACK. YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF ENDING. THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT CASE. I DON'T WANT TO RELITIGATE IT.
NO, AND I DON'T WANT TO EITHER. BUT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU SAY.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S GENERALLY MY POINT.
I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY 600 PAGES, I MEAN.
Jon: EXACTLY.
THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT BATHROOM. I MEAN CLEARLY THERE WAS NOT A RAPE BECAUSE THAT RAPE CHARGED WAS DROPPED BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THAT BATHROOM TO MAKE CRYSTAL MANGUM THE VICTIM SLASH AS SHE'S KNOWN NOW AS THE ACCUSER HAVE THIS POST TRAUMATIC STRESS INCIDENT WHERE SHE THOUGHT THAT THIS HAPPENED TO HER. AND, THERE WAS DNA EVIDENCE ON FINGER NAILS THAT DEFENSE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.
Jon: RIGHT, WELL, I GUESS THE POINT IS GIVEN THE STORY THAT SHE TOLD, THE EVIDENCE DIDN'T MATCH THAT. IT MATCHED MAYBE SOMETHING BUT NOT THAT.
IT DEFINITELY DID NOT MATCH WHAT SHE FIRST SAID THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
Jon: WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT BECAUSE WHAT I THINK IS MORE INTERESTING IS PERHAPS THE LARGER POINT OF THESE CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS TRYING TO BALANCE EDUCATION AND THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF SPORT AND ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT?
IF YOU'RE NICE.
Jon: SURE, WHY NOT. STICK AROUND. PRICE OF SILENCE IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. WILLIAM COHAN, EVERYBODY.
