Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT CHILDHOOD FRIEND OF MAX BROWNING, JONAH HILL IS HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. ALL IN ALL I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THIS HAS BEEN AN UP AND DOWN YEAR BUT CERTAINLY NOT A GOOD YEAR FOR PRIVACY. BETWEEN EDWARD SNOWDEN'S REVELATIONS ABOUT THE NSA AND THE REVELATIONS THAT IKEA IS SPYING ON ITS EMPLOYEES. THERE'S THAT NEW ABC SHOW HOWIE MANDEL WATCHES YOU POOP. THAT IS AN INVASION. I DIDN'T SIGN UP TO BE A CONTESTANT YET THERE I WAS. [LAUGHTER] THIS WEEK BRINGS THE MOST DEVASTATING PRIVACY NEWS YET.
A BOMBSHELL REVEALED. PROSECUTORS SAY THE NOW SHUT DOWN NEWS OF THE WORLD NEWSPAPER HACKED THE ROYALS' PHONE.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? QUEEN SELFIES. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT SUP, GIRL? [LAUGHTER] I GOTTA SAY THOUGH I DON'T CARE FOR THEM HACKING THE ROYALS PHONES BUT THAT HAS TO BE JUICY MATERIAL.
A PHONE HACKING TRIAL THAT WILLIAM CALLED KATE BABYKINS.
THE QUEEN WAS FURIOUS.
SOME OF THE GUARDS WERE SCOFFING SOME OF THE NUTS LEFT OUT FOR HER TO EAT WITHIN THE PALACE.
Jon: THEY HAVE TO LEAVE NUTS AROUND THE PALACE FOR THE QUEEN AS THOUGH SHE'S A COMMON SQUIRREL? SHE'S A QUEEN CAN'T SHE STORE THEM IN HER ROYAL CHEEKS? FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY THE SENIOR ROYAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: THIS IS AN AMAZING SITUATION BUT IS THERE REALLY A STORY HERE?
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY ASKING ME THAT.
Jon: I'M ASKING THAT QUESTION.
THAT'S NOT JUST A STORY THERE'S A TRAVESTY HERE. WHERE'S THE MAGIC? WHERE'S THE INTRIGUE? THE SEX? ALL WE'REHE GETTING IS A BABY TALKING PRINCE AND A NUT OBSESSED PENSIONER. GOOD LUCK SELLING A COLLECTIBLE PLATE WITH THOSE THINGS ON THERE.
Jon: I THOUGHT THAT WENT WELL. YOU THINK THAT WENT WELL?
THAT BIT, WHY?
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY. DID YOU THINK US DISCUSSING THIS WAS THAT WE GOT LAUGHS.
YEAH, A FEW, NOT BAD.
Jon: DO YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT WE WORKED ON THIS ALL DAY -- [LAUGHTER] -- THIS BIT WE DID HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS LIKE JOHN OLIVER HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?
SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS.
Jon: SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS BUT JOHN, WE KNOW THIS, YOU ARE A TREMENDOUSLY TALENTED INDIVIDUAL. YOU KNOW WE KNOW YOU ARE TALENTED. JOHN -- JOHN GOT HIS OWN SHOW ON HBO WHICH IS LONG OVERDUE AND WE'RE EXCITED FOR HIM BUT THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY HIS LAST NIGHT WITH US. [AUDIENCE AWWWWS] I WENT THROUGH A CHARADE OF WRITING THIS ROYAL NUT BIT.
WE'RE TO THE DOING THE (bleep) BIT.
Jon: OF COURSE NOT. WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE DOING HERE.
I THOUGHT YOU CARED ABOUT THE QUEEN.
Jon: I DON'T CARE. THERE'S ONLY ONE BRITISH ROYAL I CARE ABOUT TONIGHT AND HIS NAME IS PRINCE JOHN OLIVER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT. YOU CAME TO US FROM -- I THINK YOU CAME FROM ELLSBURY ON RIGHTLY. MUFFIN ON PUFFIN STUFF.
THAT'S OFFENSIVE BUT FINE.
Jon: IT SHOULD BE. BUT WHAT JOHN BROUGHT TO US WAS A BROAD RANGE OF CHARACTERS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. I'M JOINED FROM LONDON BY THE DAILY SHOW'S CORRESPONDENT.
HELLO JON, HOW ARE YOU? HELLO MR. STEWART FINE AND DANDY IF I MAY SAY. HAVE NO FEAR ENGLAND IS HERE TO MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BETTER. CAN WE HAVE SOME MORE. IT BE CHRISTMAS DAY, SIR. INDIA THERE'S A LAND WORTH SUBJUGATING. I CAN'T MEET THE ROYAL BABY WITH PEACH FUZ. WHAT IF HE WANTS TO TOUCH ME FACE. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE EVEN LESS RANGE THAN YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT IS NICE WHEN YOU WATCH THE CLIPS, YOU AND I HAVEN'T AGED A DAY. [ LAUGHTER ] HERE IS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS EVEN BETTER. THIS IS AN AMERICAN SHOW. YOU STEPPED INTO IT. IT WAS AN UNUSUAL SITUATION. BUT THE BRITS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR SOPHISTICATED WIT. JOHN OLIVER BROUGHT THAT.
WALKING DOWN THE BLOCK AN OLD MAN PAYS TO YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
SODOMY, WHACKING OFF.
Jon: THANK YOU JOHN OLIVER.
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A PROFESSIONAL NEWS MAN ENJOY A PHENOMENAL STORY BEFORE. SCRATCH MY BEG. MY ASS WAS (bleep) MY BALLS THROUGH A CIRCULAR SAW. OW! OW! [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS --
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE TO DO. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: EVEN DOING LIKE WHATEVER LIKE BROOKLYN YOU STILL GO INTO THE --
I HAVE ONE MOVE.
Jon: BE SERIOUS FOR JUST A MINUTE. YOU KNOW, THE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED ABOUT WHAT YOU DO IS IN THE FIELD YOU BROUGHT OUT SUCH INCREDIBLE PIECES AND SUCH INCREDIBLE WORK. WE HAVE NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH TIME TO SHOW SOME OF THE AMAZING PIECES THAT JOHN DID IN THE FIELD. HERE SAY LITTLE TOUCH OF SOME OF THE WORK THAT JOHN WAS ABLE TO DO IN THE FIELD. TAKE A LOOK.
WHAT MAKES A POLITICIAN SUCCESSFUL?
GETTING REELECTED BY HIS OR HER CONSTITUENTS.
RIGHT, YEAH. THAT IS HOW YOU JUDGE SUCCESS:  OKAY.
WELL, GETTING LEGISLATION DONE.
IS SECOND?
IS SECOND, YES.
THAT IS SECOND. HOLY (bleep) THAT IS SECOND? >>AHH?
DO BLACK PEOPLE EVER SAY THANK YOU TO WHITE PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE HERE.
NO.
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.
NO.
THEY NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM US.
REMIND ME WHY CUTTING OFF UNESCO'S FUNDING IS A GOOD THING.
WE DIDN'T CREATE THIS PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE HEADLINE WE DIDN'T CREATE THIS PROGRAM.
ALTHOUGH WE DID CREATE THE LAW.
CONFUSED AGAIN.
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS HERE.
FOR SURE.
FOR SURE.
YES.
AND WHEN THE PROGRAMS ARE GETTING SHUTDOWN WE FEEL LIKE THE GOOD GUYS BECAUSE?
WE ARE.
BECAUSE WE ARE. WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS. DON'T LAUGH THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS THE BACKBONE OF U.S. POLICY. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD COME TO THIS BEACHFRONT RESORT TO SEND A SERIOUS MESSAGE.
THE BUDGETARY PROBLEMS HAVE TO START WITH THE SPENDING. YOU HAVE TO STOP SPENDING.
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T BE GOING TO HAWAII.
APPEARANCES ARE IMPORTANT. WORDS MEAN THINGS BUT PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE THINGS YOU DO. YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SPEND YOUR MONEY OR DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO AND THEN WITH THAT FREEDOM ALSO COMES THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS.
YEAH, YEAH.
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WASHINGTON IS NOT SEEING.
WOW. WOW.
IS THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
THEY ARE NOT SEEING IT?
NO THEY ARE NOT.
WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF UZBEKISTAN?
THE PRESIDENT OF UZBEKISTAN? [LAUGHTER]
