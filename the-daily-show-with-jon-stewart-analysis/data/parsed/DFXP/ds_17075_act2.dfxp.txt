WELCOME BACK. COMING UP, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS. A FIELD PIECE SO EPIC IT CANNOT BE CONTAINED MERELY IN ONE SEGMENT. SO THERE WILL BE NO GUESTS TONIGHT, SORRY AUTHOR OF THE BOOK DEAR GRAVES COOLIDGE, THE TERSE AND FORMAL LOVE LETTERS OF CALVIN COOLIDGE BUT YOU TOO WILL UNDERSTAND  OUR CHOICE ONCE YOU WITNESS THIS STARTLING REPORT FILED BY OUR OWN JOHN OLIVER.
UNESCO IS AN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION STATEMENT INCLUDES THE  BUILDING OF PEACE, THE IMPROVEMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE ALLEVIATION OF POVERTY WORLDWIDE. SO NATURALLY, AMERICA DID THIS.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED THE U.S. WILL STOP PAYMENT TO UNESCO AND  SUSPEND ALL FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS.
WHY WOULD WE CUT OFF SUPPORT TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS PEOPLE IN NEED  ALL OVER THE WORLD? BECAUSE THEY RECENTLY VOTED TO ADMIT PALESTINIAN AS A MEMBER. CONGRESSMAN ROBERT WECHSLER EXPLAINS.
THE ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE AND IF THE PALESTINIANS SEEK TO GO  DIRECTLY TO THE U.N. OR ANY OF ITS AGENCIES, WE'RE NOT GOING TO FUND THOSE AGENCIES. (LAUGHTER)
END OF MESSAGE.
WELL, WE DID SEND A MESSAGE.
YEAH, WE DID. BOOM, SUCK IT, UNESCO, SUCK IT. WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS, THOUGH. UNESCO DOES EXTRAORDINARY WORK. MANY OF THE THINGS THEY DO ARE LIFESAVING.
SURE THAT'S ALL VERY SAD BUT THE MAIN MESSAGE IS HOMIE DON'T PLAY THAT  [BLEEP].
WELL, THAT'S RIGHT AND OUR HANDS ARE TIED. THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S HANDS ARE TIED. THIS IS THE LAW.
YES, IT'S THE LAW. A 20-YEAR-OLD LAW WHICH PROHIBITS ANY U.N. ORGANIZATION THAT RECOGNIZED PALESTINE. BUT THIS SITUATION ISN'T OUR FAULT.
YOU OUGHT TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE AT UNESCO FOR ACTING FOOLISHLY AND CREATING THIS, THIS UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE.
EXACTLY. UNESCO DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY HAVE PUT AMERICA IN. ALL THEY CARED ABOUT WAS SOME POOR STARVING PEOPLE.
SO WE CUT YOUR FUNDING. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, SON.
I BELIEVE THERE WERE 100 COUNTRIES IN FAVOR OF PALESTINIAN MEMBERSHIP AS A  FULL MEMBER STATE.
THE PROBLEM IS UNESCO HAS ITS OWN LAWS THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW. WHICH REQUIRES DECISIONS TO BE MADE DEMOCRATICALLY. SO YOU BROUGHT IT ON YOURSELF.
ONE MIGHT SAY THAT WE BROUGHT IT ON OURSELVES.
YEAH, I JUST DID SAY THAT I SAID EXACTLY THOSE WORDS.
BUT WE'RE LOSING A PROGRAM THAT WOULD HELP US FIND WATER FOR 950,000 REFUGEES. WE'RE WORKING ON ANTI-FAMINE PROGRAMS. WE'RE HELPING TO PROMOTE EDUCATION IN SOUTH SUDAN. WE HAVE THE TSUNAMI EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO BE CUT.
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CHOICE BUT TO CUT OFF  FUNDING FOR TSUNAMI VICTIMS AND STARVING DROUGHT-RIDEN AFRICAN CHILDREN. REALLY, YOU OWE THEM AN APOLOGY. IN FACT, I ACTUALLY HAVE A CARD HERE FOR AFRICA. IT SAYS SORRY YOU ARE DYING OFS THIRST AND FAMINE, WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING IT, PUTTING  GEORGE IN THERE AND OBVIOUSLY WRITING NOT IN FRONT OF SORRY.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN THIS CARD IS, WE'RE GOING TO STAY INVOLVED. WE'RE GOING TO BE PART OF WHAT IS GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER.
WHAT A SAME THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO READ THAT BECAUSE YOU CUT 9 I LITERACY PROGRAM.
BUT LUCKILY THIS ISN'T GOING TO AFFECT AMERICA.
SO WHO GIVES A [BLEEP].
BUT IT DOESN'T COME WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE UNITED STATES AS WELL.
YOU KNOW, IN IRAQ WE WERE ABOUT TO LAUNCH A PROGRAM TO STRENGTHEN THE IRAQIS. IN AFGHANISTAN, 70% OF THE AFGHAN POLICE FORCE IS ILLITERATE. AND WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO TRAIN 3,000 AFGHAN POLICE OFFICERS.
REALLY?
THAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA.
IS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE. WE'RE CUTTING OFF UNESCO'S PROJECT, THAT ARE CERTAINLY COMPLIMENTARY TO OUR  INTERESTS, YES, BUT WE'RE SENDING A POINT. THE POINT IS WE HELD INTERESTS, WE HAVE SET UP A LAW. WE WARNED YOU.
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW USEFUL IT WOULD BE TO U.S. TROOPS IF THE AFGHAN  POLICE FORCE COULD READ.
IT WOULD. BUT WE'RE ALSO SENDING THE POINT TO OTHER U.N. AGENCIES.
RIGHT.
AND WHEN YOU PHYSICALLY CUT OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE, THAT FACE IS  SENDING A MESSAGE. AND THAT MESSAGE IS DON'T  [BLEEP] WITH ME. BECAUSE IF I'M WILLING TO DO THIS TO MYSELF, WHAT AM I WILLING TO DO TO YOU.
AND THE PROOF IS NO OTHER UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION HAS DONE WHAT UNESCO'S DONE, AT LEAST NOT YET.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. NOW UNLESS UNESCO DOES BA WE WANT, THEY'RE GOING TO FOLD LIKE A BADLY NEEDED  IRRIGATION PROJECT.
YOU NEED US AND WE'VE GOT YOU BY THE BALLS. WHERE ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE MONEY.
THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SEE VALUE IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING.
WHAT BIG SPENDER IS GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS HOLE.
GABON.
THEY WERE THE FIRST COUNTRY TO STEP UP AND PLEDGE $2 MILLION.
GABON GAVE YOU $2 MILLION.
THAT'S CORRECT.
[BLEEP] GABON. THAT WAS IT I WAS GOING TO GO AND CONFRONT GABON FACE-TO-FACE, AFTER ONE MORE KEY QUESTION. SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE ASKED BEFORE. WHERE IS GABON?
WEST COAST OF AFRICAN.
RIGHT, I'M OFF. COMING UP IN PART TWO, I ACTUALLY GO TO GABON. [BLEEP] GABON.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIG
