SEPTEMBER 12, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY KIND. WE HAVE A GREAT MONDAY NIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, ONE OF MY FAVORITES, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEF OF STAFFS ADMIRAL  MIKE MULLEN WILL BE JOINING US LATER. IT'S OUR THIRD TIME TALKING TO HIM WHICH I BELIEVE MAKES ME A SERGEANT. (LAUGHING) WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE OBVIOUSLY THE BIG STORY FROM THIS WEEKEND. OBVIOUSLY WHAT EVERYONE WAS TALKING AND THINKING ABOUT: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S JOBS BILL. A BILL SO IMPORTANT THAT ITS UNVEILING LAST THURSDAY NIGHT PREEMPTED THE PACKERS'-SAINTS  GAME PRE-GAME THROUGH. TWO TEAMS WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE COMING SEASON. I'M SORRY. WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT? JOBS BILL. WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS THAT IT PREEMPTED MY PRE-GAME SHOW?
IT WILL CREATE MORE JOBS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, MORE JOBS FOR TEACHERS, MORE JOBS  FOR VETERANS AND MORE JOBS FOR LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. REPAIR AND MODERNIZE AT LEAST 35,000 SCHOOLS. IT WILL PROVIDE A TAX BREAK FOR COMPANIES WHO HIRE NEW WORKERS AND CUT PAYROLL TAXES  IN HALF FOR EVERY WORKING AMERICAN AND EVERY SMALL BUSINESS.
Jon: IT WILL TRIPLE GUARANTEE THAT ALL CHILDREN GET TO BE THE THING THEY  WANTED TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP, INCLUDING ASTRONAUTS, BALLERINA, LION-TAMER, AND MOST OF ALL BATMAN. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THEY  CAN BECOME MR. PRESIDENT. WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS PLAN? THAT DOES SO MUCH FOR SO MANY?
IT'S CALLED THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT.
Jon: THAT'S ALL YOU GOT? THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT? WAS EMPLOYMENT IDEAS T.B.D.ALREADY TAKEN? COME ON, EVEN YOUR CRAPPY BILLS HAVE ASPIRATIONAL QUALITIES TO THEM. THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT. WE DIDN'T AND IT WASN'T. BUT IT WAS TRYING. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE BUSH ERA ORWELLIAN OPPOSITE DAY NOMENCLATURE. ALLOWING COMPANIES TO INCINERATE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND CALL IT THE CLEAR SKIES ACT. GIVE US SOME SPIN. A LITTLE HUMOR. A LITTLE ZING. THE AMERICANS TAKE THIS JOB AND LOVE IT ACT. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THE MAKE IT RAIN ACT. THE REMEMBER ME, I (BEEP) BIN LADEN EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 2001. GIVE US SOMETHING. BRANDING ISSUES ASIDE, OBAMA WAS ON A TEAR THURSDAY NIGHT.
WHAT I WILL NOT DO IS LET THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS BE USED AS AN EXCUSE TO WIPE OUT THE  BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT AMERICANS HAVE COUNTED ON FOR DECADES. THIS ISN'T CLASS WARFARE. THIS IS SIMPLE MATH. THIS LARGER NOTION THAT THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO TO RESTORE PROSPERITY IS JUST  DISMANTLE GOVERNMENT, REFUND EVERYBODY'S MONEY AND LET EVERYONE WRITE THEIR OWN RULES  AND TELL EVERYONE THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN, THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.
Jon: FELT PRETTY GOOD. DIDN'T IT? WAS THAT SO HARD, MR. PRESIDENT? MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS WHOLE "HIT 'EM WHERE IT HURTS"  THING BEFORE THE COUNTRY SLID INTO AN UNSTOPPABLE (BEEP) SPIRAL. YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE MOST? (LAUGHING) YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT THAT SPEECH TO THE CONGRESSIONAL JOINT  SESSION, THE AWESOME CUT-AWAYS TO UNCOMFORTABLE REPUBLICANS. LOOK AT THOSE FACES. IT IS A VERITABLE SPECTRUM OF POORLY CONCEALED DISCOMFORT. EVERY SHADE OF DISCOMFORT REPRESENTED. ERIC CANTOR LOOKS LIKE HE'S THINKING, "MAYBE I DON'T MOVE, THE T-REX WON'T SEE ME." RAND PAUL TRYING NOT TO LOOK DISGUSTED LIKE IF HIS  MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS SHOWING OFF BELLY DANCE LESSONS AS A FRIEND'S CONFIRMATION. MITCH McCONNELL LOOKS STUNNED AND FAT LIKE A GUY WHO JUST SAW A DOG WITH WHEELS INSTEAD  OF BACK LEGS ROLL BY. AND JOHN McCAIN HAS THE LOOK OF A MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA THE PLAY HE WAS WATCHING WOULD  FEATURE SO MUCH FULL FRONTAL MALE NUDITY. PUPPETRY OF THE PENIS. I THOUGHT THE FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE PUPPETRY. SO THE PRESIDENT WAS ON A ROLL. OF COURSE WE'VE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO OBAMA ACQUIESCING TO REPUBLICAN LEGISLATIVE INTRANSYENTS. WHAT'S HIS STRATEGY.
YOU SHOULD PASS THIS JOBS PLAN RIGHT AWAY. PASS THIS JOBS BILL AND WE CAN PUT PEOPLE TO WORK REBUILDING AMERICA. PASS THIS BILL. PASS THIS JOBS BILL. PASS THIS BILL RIGHT AWAY. PASS THIS JOBS BILL. PASS THIS BILL. PASS THIS BILL RIGHT AWAY.
Jon: YOU CAN REPEAT IT ALL YOU WANT. IT'S NOT REALLY....
PASS THIS JOBS BILL.
Jon: IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE....
PASS THIS JOBS BILL.
Jon: TOUCHE. THAT WAS THURSDAY NIGHT. THE NEXT DAY, OBAMA HEADS OUT TO SELL THE BILL WITH A HUGE RALLY-- AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS  A NICE TOUCH-- ERIC CANTOR'S HOME DISTRICT. THIS MORNING HE DOES THE WHOLE ROSE GARDEN CEREMONY WITH A HUNDRED OF HIS CLOSEST PROPS.
STAND ING WITH ME THIS MORNING ARE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL BE HELPED BY THE AMERICAN  JOBS ACT. I'M STANDING WITH TEACHERS. I'M STANDING HERE WITH VETERANS, WITH COPS AND FIREFIGHTERS, SMALL BUSINESS  OWNERS, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.
Jon: WOW. IT'S LIKE HE'S WITH THE VILLAGE PEOPLE. IT'S LIKE HE IS WITH THE VILLAGE PEOPLE OF A DOUBLE-DIP RECESSION. WE HAVE TO LIVE AT THE Y-M-C-A. LOOK, I'VE GOT TO SAY... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LOOK AT THE FIRE. LOOK AT THE FIRE IN OBAMA'S BELLY. LOOK AT IT.
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON TO BE WORRYING ABOUT THEIR JOBS. IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO BE WORRYING ABOUT YOUR JOBS. NOW IS THE TIME TO PUT AMERICANS BACK TO WORK. NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT.
Jon: I REMEMBER THAT GUY. IT'S SO REFRESHING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. CAMPAIGN OBAMA IS BACK. SO MUCH COOLER THAN GOVERNING OBAMA. I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN CAMPAIGN OBAMA EXISTED AFTER TWO-AND-A-HALF YEARS OF  WATCHING THIS OTHER GUY.
WHAT YOU SAW... AND AGAIN, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL SEE THIS FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF... OF... OF THE DEAL. ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY HAD AGREED TO GIVE ON IS... IS TO... TO GET BACK TO... UH, A BASELINE. THIS STARTS GETTING TECHNICAL. BUT THERE WERE ABOUT 800 BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. WHAT WE SAID WAS WHEN YOU HAVE A RATIO OF $4 IN CUTS FOR EVERYONE DOLLAR OF REVENUE  THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO STOMACH.
Jon: THAT'S WHY I FOLDED ON THE DEFICIT REDUCTION DEAL. ANYWAY, SEE THE OTHER GUY WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE THAT. BECOMING CAMPAIGN OBAMA HAS REINVIGORATED OBAMA. RAISING MONEY. ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES. YOUR OPPONENTS ARE RAISING MONEY ON THEIR OWN AND ROLLING UP THEIR SLEEVES? WAIT. I THINK I MAY HAVE AN IDEA THAT MAY SOLVE ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS. FOREVER. NO, IT'S NOT HELP FOR PANDAS. LET US AS A NATION GIVE UP THE PIPE DREAM ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT AN INSPIRATIONAL LEADER  CAN CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, REMAKE WASHINGTON AND GOVERN SUCCESSFULLY. BUT WE CAN PLAY TO OUR STRENGTHS AND EMBRACE AN AMERICA WHOSE GREATEST RESOURCE IS CAMPAIGN-DRIVEN DRIBBLE. WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN ASPIRING POLITICAL LEADERS TELLING US HOW GREAT WE ARE. LET'S USE THAT AND CONVERT AMERICA TO A CAMPAIGN-BASED ECONOMY. THE COMMERCIALS, THE BUS TOURS, THE FUND RAISING. THINK OF HOW MANY TEACHERS, FIRST RESPONDERS AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WE COULD HIRE IF WE NEED THEM TO STAND  BEHIND POLITICIANS EIGHT HOURS A DAY, 365 DAYS A YEAR. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  AND PUMP MORE MONEY IN A LOCAL  ECONOMY THAN A POLITICAL CONVENTION. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS COULD HOLD ONE MONTHLY IN EVERY STATE INJECTING BILLIONS  INTO THE BALLOON DROP STRAW HAT ESCORT AND DEAD ESCORT REMOVAL INDUSTRIES. CAN WE SAVE THIS COUNTRY BY RELYING ON OUR GREATEST NATURAL RESOURCE: HAND-CRANKED  CORPORATELY FINANCED BULL (BEEP) MACHINES? I SAY YES, WE CAN! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
