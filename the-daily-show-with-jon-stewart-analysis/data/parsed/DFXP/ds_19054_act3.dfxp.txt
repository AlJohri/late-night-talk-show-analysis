Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT ONE OF BEST. HE DIRECTED A FILM OVER 15 YEARS AGO AND IS RELEASING IT ON HIS WEB SITE TOMORROW IT'S CALLED "TOMORROW NIGHT."
HELLO, HELLO, MOM?

MOM, IT'S ME WILLIE, YOUR SON WILLIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING, MA?
OH, FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M A VERY OLD WOMAN. [ LAUGHTER ]
MOM, YOU SOUND WEIRD. ARE YOU OKAY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM LOUIS CK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOUIS CK! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOUIS CK! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU ENGLEBERT HUMPERDINK? WHAT IS THIS?
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE COUPLE IN THE CORNER GOT A LITTLE LOVE.
Jon: A LITTLE LOVE FROM LOUIE, OVER THERE. DOUBLE GUNS, BABY.
I FORGOT STEVE CARELL WAS --
Jon: WOULD THAT BE WEIRD ON A LATE NIGHT SHOW? COULD YOU DO THAT, YOU THINK? IS THERE ANY OTHER HOST THAT YOU -- CAN'T TOUCH HIS FACE.
I WOULD BE ON "THE NEW YORK POST".
Jon: I'VE BEEN ON LETTERMAN A BUNCH OF TIMES. I DON'T THINK I TOUCHED HIS FACE.
I HAVE NEVER TOUCHED HIS FACE. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS. MOST PEOPLE'S FACES I HAVEN'T TOUCHED.
Jon: IN THE WORLD?
MAYBE 15 FACES MY ENTIRE LIFE. 16 NOW BECAUSE I TOUCHED YOURS. MY FIRST TIME I TOUCHED MY OWN. IT'S GETTING STUPID.
Jon: IT IS GETTING A LITTLE STUPID. YOU HAVE STEVE CARELL IN THIS FILM SMIGEL, ALL THESE GREAT PEOPLE IN THE FILM.
I KNOW THEY ARE IN IT, YES.
Jon: YOU BROKE THEM IN THEIR CAREERS. YOU WERE THE ONE. THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: AND NOW YOU ARE RELEASING IT.
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY WERE ALL BROKEN BY THIS FILM THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BEGINNINGS OF STEVE CARELL. IT WAS DELAYED.
Jon: WHEN DID YOU FINISH IT, FINISH IT? I REMEMBER YOU WERE EDITING IT AND IT WAS 1996.
YOU GAVE ME $5,000 TO HELP ME MAKE THE MOVIE. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
Jon: I DO REMEMBER THAT.
YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU WANT MONEY FOR YOUR PROJECT --
Jon: NO. LOUIE CAME TO ME.
HE DOESN'T SAY NO.
Jon: WE MADE A DEAL. I GAVE YOU THE MONEY AND YOU GAVE ME -- REMEMBER THAT TRUMPET YOU USED TO HAVE? I BOUGHT YOUR TRUMPET.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: YOU USED THAT MONEY TO MAKE THE MOVIE.
I WASN'T ALL THAT -- YES, IT HELPED. A BUNCH OF FRIENDS GAVE ME MONEY.
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS SMART TO GIVE YOU MONEY FOR THIS FILM AND NOT YOUR SHOW. I'M SMART THAT WAY. I SAID LET ME CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO. LET ME PICK THE ONE THAT IS NEVER COMING OUT.
THAT'S RIGHT. I LOVED IT AND WANTED IT. MADE IT JUST THE WAY I WANTED TO. ALL THE MONEY I HAD I PUT INTO IT. AND SOME I DIDN'T. AND I DID A FEW ILLEGAL THINGS TO GET IT DONE AND THEN I TOOK IT TO SUNDANCE AND NOBODY WANTED IT. I STUCK IT ON A SHELF AND I THOUGHT SOME DAY I'LL SHOW IT TO EVERYBODY ONE PERSON AT A TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS NO INTERNET WHEN I MADE THIS MOVIE.
Jon: WHEN YOU SHOW IT TO THEM, TOUCH THEIR FACES.
IT'S A GOOD PERSONAL -- THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: GO, DO YOU LIKE IT? THAT WILL BE NICE. HERE IS WHAT -- LOUIE AND I WORKED TOGETHER ON  CAROLINE'S COMEDY HOUR. HE HAD THE BEST IDEAS BUT WE COULD NEVER AFFORD THEM. DAVID ATTELL AND I WERE THE OTHER TWO WRITERS. WE WOULD BE LIKE WHAT IF WE HAD FIVE SECOND SCENERIOS AND SOMETHING FUNNY HAPPENS. AND LOUIE WOULD BE LIKE AND WHAT IF WE GOT AN ARMY OF HESSIAN FIGHTERS. WE WOULD BE LIKE IT'S HILARIOUS BUT WE CAN'T DO IT.
NEVER, NO.
Jon: WHEN YOU WATCH IT NOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I WANTED IT TO COME OUT?
WELL, I DID THEN. I FELT LIKE I WAS SO HAPPY AND PROUD OF IT. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO WATCH NOW BECAUSE IT'S CRAZY. THE WHOLE MOVIE IS LIKE THAT IT'S JUST NOTHING MAKES MUCH SENSE BUT THE PERFORMANCES ARE GREAT. I WROTE EACH PART FOR EVERY PERSON. STEVE CARELL I HAD WORKED WITH ON THE DANA CARVEY SHOW. I WROTE IT FOR HIM AND SMIGEL. JB SMOOVE WAS A YOUNG COMIC. STEVE CARELL I HAD WORKED WITH ON THE DANA CARVEY SHOW. I WROTE IT FOR HIM AND SMIGEL. JB SMOOVE WAS A YOUNG COMIC.
Jon: CHUCK SKLAR.
NOBODY KNOWS HIM BUT THIS WAS HIS ONE STARRING ROLE.
Jon: DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU SOLD THE MOVIE TO ME WHEN I CAME?
NO, WHAT DID I SAY?
Jon: YOU CAME TO ME AND SAID I HAVE AN IDEA FOR A MOVIE ABOUT A GUY THAT GETS SEXUAL GRATIFICATION SITTING IN A BOWL OF ICE CREAM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: SO I NEED $5,000. I ASKED YOU, WHAT FLAVOR?
THAT'S RIGHT. I MADE IT AND NOBODY EVER SAW IT. IT'S BEEN SITTING ON A SHELF AND NO ONE HAS SEEN ANY OF IT UNTIL TOMORROW.
Jon: YOU MADE IT WITH FILM.
SUPER 16MM BLOWN UP TO 35MM AND IT SAT THERE. I MADE A BIG DIGITAL TRANSFER OF IT. WE'RE PUTTING IT ON MY SITE AND SELLING IT FOR $5.
Jon: WE WERE SO IMPRESSED BY YOU THAT YOU EVEN HAD THE  WHEREWITHAL -- WE NEVER EXPRESSED THAT BECAUSE WE'RE LOSERS WHO CANNOT EXPRESS ANYTHING BUT WHEN LOUIE DID THAT -- WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF SCHMUCKS THAT USED TO SIT IN DINERS LATE AT NIGHT. HE WAS CREATING THIS FILM AND PUT IT TOGETHER AND SHOWED INITIATIVE IN A ROOM FULL OF POT HEADS WHICH WAS LIKE WOW.
COMEDIANS ONLY HAVE TO WORK AN HOUR A NIGHT SOMETIMES. AND THERE'S A LOT OF -- YEAH, YOU JUST SIT AROUND. I WANTED TO MAKE A MOVIE. I WAS DYING TO MAKE A MOVIE. I KNEW I COULDN'T GET A JOB  MAKING A MOVIE BUT I THOUGHT IF I CALLED TOGETHER A FEW DOLLARS I COULD MAKE TECHNICALLY A MOVIE. SO THIS IS A MOVIE. IT'S A MOVIE. IT'S LONG ENOUGH TO BE A MOVIE. IT'S ON FILM, PEOPLE TALK IN THE CAMERA.
Jon: YOU JUST WROTE YOUR OWN AD IN VARIETY. THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE -- LOUIS CK SAYS THIS IS A MOVIE.
YES. EVERYBODY IS VERY FUNNY. IT'S A WEIRD RELIC. THE HARDEST THING TO WATCH IS THAT PEOPLE DIAL ON ROTARY PHONES AND YOU HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WATCH THEM DIAL. I TOLD MYSELF YOU HAVE TO REALLY DIAL ALL SEVEN NUMBERS ON THE STUPID PHONE. I'M LIKE PLEASE GO BACK IN TIME AND CUT THE (bleep) THING IT'S A NIGHTMARE.
Jon: WHERE ARE YOU HOLDING THE WRAP PARTY?
OH THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. HALF THE PEOPLE ARE DEAD. THERE ARE A COUPLE DEAD GUYS IN THE MOVIE. THEY WEREN'T DEAD.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE A WEIRD CAST.
IT WOULD BE CHEAPER.
Jon: WHAT ARE THE UNION RULES?
I'M GOING MAKE A WHOLE MOVIE WITH CORPSES. IT'S MY NEXT THING. YOU PUT PEANUT BUTTER IN THE MOUTH BECAUSE DEAD PEOPLE LOVE PEANUT BUTTER.
Jon: THAT WOULD BE THE MOST INSTANTLY CLASSIC MOVIE IN THE WORLD. TOMORROW NIGHT WITH DEAD PEOPLE WILL BE AVAILABLE ON LOUIE'S WEB SITE LOUISCK.NET?
OR .COM DOESN'T MATTER. I LOST LOUIS CK.COM FOR A LITTLE BIT. SO I HAD .NET SO I HAD TO GET IT. ANOTHER LOUIS C.K.? IF YOU HAVE A WEB SITE THAT HAS ANY TRAFFIC AND YOU LET THE OWNERSHIP LAPSE IT'S PORN NEXT SECOND. IT WAS PORN FOR LIKE A WEEK. I HAD TO GET IT BACK. [ LAUGHTER ] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I SAY THIS AND I SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY, COULDN'T YOU SHARE?
SURE, SURE. THIS IS THE NEXT THING ON THE WEB SITE. I'M RELEASING TOD BERRY TODD BERRY IS A GREAT COMEDIAN. GREAT COMEDIAN. PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY TIME WITH HIS APPLAUSE THOUGH. HE DID A CROWD WORK TOUR WHERE HE ONLY TALKS TO THE AUDIENCE. HE DID A WHOLE TOUR OF HOUR LONG SHOWS WITH NO JOKES JUST CHATTING WITH THE AUDIENCE. SO WE -- I SENT A CREW OUT. THE FIRST THING I FUNDED THROUGH MY WEB SITE. I FINANCED IT, WE PRODUCED FOR TODD CALLED TODD BERRY CROWD WORK. IT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED ON THE WEB SITE. YOU ARE THE DON KERSHNER OF COMEDY.
