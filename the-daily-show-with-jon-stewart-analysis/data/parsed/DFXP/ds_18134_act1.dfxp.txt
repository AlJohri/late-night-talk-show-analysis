FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I'M STILL SITTING IN FOR JON  STEWART. HE IS WAITING AT HOME FOR TIME  WARNER TO COME FIX HIS CABLE. THEY SAID THEY'D BE THERE  BETWEEN NOON AND 2:00 ON JUNE  10. FRANKLY HE'S STILL WAITING  THERE. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM PROJECT  RUNWAY, MR. TIM GUNN IS WITH US. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] A GLORIOUS HUMAN BEING. BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH  JUSTICE. NOW EARLIER THIS SUMMER WE HEARD  A LOT ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT  WHICH LIKEDDED GAY MARRIAGE BUT NOT SOUTHERN MINORITIES' ABILITY  TO VOTE FOR IT. BUT THERE ARE OTHER MUCH LESS  SUPREME COURTS. DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE  SITTING IN ONE RIGHT NOW? THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT'S  INSTALLMENT OF JUDGE JOHNNY. BAIL LIVE, SHOOT THAT MAN.
YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE  COURTROOM OF JUDGE JOHNNY  OLIVER.
MELISSA, PLEASE PASS YOUR  KNIVES AND GO.
HE'S NOT LEGALLY TRAINED. HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE  JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS BASED  ENTIRELY ON RERUNS OF NIGHT  COURT.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS, HIT THE  SHOWERS.
HIS DECISIONS ARE GENERALLY  BAD. THIS IS JUDGE JOHNNY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
COURT IS IN SESSION. JASON JONES, PLEASE CALL  TONIGHT'S FIRST DEFENDANT.
JUDGE JOHNNY, THE PEOPLE CALL  THE HALLIBURTON CORPORATION. YOU MAY KNOW THEM AS DICK  CHENEYs FORMER COMPANY THAT  WAS AWARDED SWEETHEART DEALS IN IRAQ, BRIBED NIGERIAN OFFICIALS,  PLED GUILTY TO VIOLATING THE  LIBYAN EMBARGO IN THE '90s AND WAS STILL DOING BUSINESS WITH  IRAN AS LATE AS 2007. THEY'VE DODGED JUSTICE SO FAR,  BUT WE'LL SEE IF THOSE  SHENANIGANS HOLD UP IN FRONT OF JUDGE JOHNNY.
THANKS, JASON. SO, I SEE THAT THIS CASE  CONCERNS THE AFTER MATH OF THE  B.P. DEEP WATER HORIZON OIL  SPILL. WHAT'S THE CHARGE?
CEMENT USED BY HALLIBURTON  CONTRACTORS TO SEAL THE B.P. WELL AGAINST EXPLOSIVE GASES WAS  UNSTABLE. BOTH COMPANIES KNEW THIS TWO  MONTHS BEFORE THE DISASTER.
THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS  DESTROYED WAS PART OF SEVERAL  SIMULATIONS CONDUCTED IN THIS POST INCIDENT EXAMINATION. SNOP POOR PLANNING LEADING TO  MAJOR DESTRUCTION FOLLOWED BY  LYING AND COVER-UPS? IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS  MAN EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH  HALLIBURTON. WELL, STRAP IN, EVERYONE. WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT A LONG  COURT BATTLE IF HALLIBURTON  TRIES TO SNAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF  THIS.
HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES  HAS AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO  DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE  COMPANY HAS AGREED TO PAY THE  MAXIMUM AVAILABLE FINE.
John: WOW, THE MAXIMUM  AVAILABLE FINE. WHAT IS THAT? A BAJILLION DOLLARS PLUS  INFINITY HOURS OF COMMUNITY  SERVICE, WRITING A HANDWRITTEN APOLOGY NOTE TO EVERY LIVING  CREATURE AFFECTED BY THE SPILL? JUDGE JOHNNY APPROVES OF THIS. BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHAT  ACTUALLY IS THE MAXIMUM FINE?
THE MAXIMUM STATUTORY FINE IN  THIS CASE, THAT IS $200,000.
John: $200,000? SO YOU CAN RUIN THE GULF COAST  AND DESTROY THE EVIDENCE ALL FOR  THE PRICE OF FOUR TOYOTA AVALONS AND HALF A SEMESTER AT N.Y.U.? ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? HOLD ON. MAYBE THIS IS GOOD NEWS. LET ME JUST DO THE MATH HERE. 200 MILLION GAL ONS SPILLED. THAT COMES OUT OF ONE TENTH OF A  CENT PER GALLON SO WE DID IT. WE BROUGHT DOWN OIL PRICES. HERE IS THE AMAZING THING. THAT PUNISHMENT WAS SO LIGHT,  EVEN HALLIBURTON WAS  UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT.
HALLIBURTON MADE A VOLUNTARY  CONTRIBUTION OF $55 MILLION TO  THE NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE FOUNDATION THAT WAS NOT  CONDITIONED ON THE COURT'S  ACCEPTANCE OF ITS PLEA  AGREEMENT.
John: MONEY THAT PRESUMABLY  WENT TOWARD ALL THOSE FISH  WIDOWS FINALLY GIVING THEIR HUSBANDS THE FUNERALS THEY  DESERVE. THAT'S RIGHT. FISH CONDUCT FUNERALS LIKE  FLUSHING THEIR LOVED ONES DOWN A  SOLID GOLD TOILET. THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO FORGET  THEM SEVEN SECONDS LATER. BUT HALLIBURTON ESCAPES JUSTICE  ONCE AGAIN. HOPEFULLY AT LEAST THEY'LL PAY  THE PRICE IN THE STOCK MARKET.
WITH THIS DEAL, CAROL, THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS AGREEING  TO NOT PURSUE ANY MORE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST HALLIBURTON. ON THIS NEWS, HALLIBURTON SHARES  ARE UP 2% IN FREE MARKET  TRADING.
John: THE SHARES WENT UP? OKAY. I'M READY TO RULE ON THIS. IN THE CASE OF HALLIBURTON  VERSUS ANY SENSE OF HUMANITY, I  FIND THAT HALLIBURTON CAN GO EAT A BAG OF THIS. ORDER. ORDER IN THE COURT. ORDER IN THE COURT. JASON, WHO IS OUR NEXT  DEFENDANT?
JUDGE JOHNNY, OUR NEXT  DEFENDANT IS THE ONLY CYCLIST  ANYONE HASSOR HEARD OF. HAVING WON THE TOUR DE FRANCE IN  UNPRECEDENTED SEVEN TIMES AFTER  TAKING AN UNPRECEDENT AMOUNT OF  STEROIDS. HE'S PERHAPS BEST KNOWN FOR  HAVING ONE TOMATO UNDER HIS  CARROT. HE IS, OF COURSE, NOTED [BLEEP] LANCE ARMSTRONG. GOOD LUCK RIDING AWAY FROM THE  JUSTICE THAT JUDGE JOHNNY IS  PEDDLING.
John: THANK YOU, JASON. LANCE ARMSTRONG IS BEING SUED BY  THE D.O.J. FOR $120 MILLION FOR  CHEATING WHEN HE WAS SPONSORED BY THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE. THAT'S A TOUGH CHARGE. WHAT'S ARMSTRONG'S DEFENSE?
LANCE ARMSTRONG NOW SAYS THE  POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN  HE WAS DOPING.
HE'S SAYING, "I LIED. YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT I  LIED."
John: WOW. THAT'S HIS DEFENSE? THIS GUY HAS GOT A LOT OF BALL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HE'S PLEADING SO GUILTY IT'S  YOUR FAULT FOR NOT KNOWING HOW  GUILTY HE IS. IS HE ARGUING ANY MITIGATING  CIRCUMSTANCES?
I KNOW IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE  PERIOD IN OUR SPORT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME, I CAME,  YOU KNOW, RIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE  MIDDLE OF THAT PERIOD.
John: YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S RIGHT. THAT IS THE REAL TRAGEDY HERE. I THINK WE ALL OWE LANCE  ARMSTRONG AN APOLOGY FOR MAKING  HIM WIN SEVEN TOUR DE FRANCES EARNING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN  THE PROCESS DURING SUCH AN  UNFORTUNATE PERIOD IN THE SPORT HE CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN. ALL RIGHT. ON THE BASIS OF THIS WORLD  RECORD NARCISSISM I FIND THE  DEFENDANT A GIANT DOUCHE. JASON. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] JASON, PLEASE CALL OUR FINAL  DEFENDANT.
SURE WILL, JUDGE JOHNNY. THE COURT CALLS JOSEPH R. BIDEN,, Jr., THE DELAWARE  DESTROYER, HE'S GOT A LION'S  HEART, A SAILOR'S MOUTH AND SOME OTHER DUDE'S HAIR. HE LOVES TRAINS BUT HE JUST GOT  ON AN EXPRESS TO JUSTICE TOWN  WHERE THE MAYOR IS JUDGE JOHNNY. LOOKS LIKE VICE PRESIDENT  BIDEN'S ABOUT TO EAT A JUSTICE  SALAD.
OKAY. THANKS VERY MUCH, JASON. LET'S HEAR THE CHARGES.
IN WASHINGTON STATE ACCUSED  OF ILLEGALLY DISCHARGING HIS  SHOTGUN HE'S USING A NEW LEGAL TECHNIQUE HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS  THE BIDEN DEFENSE.
John: THE BIDEN DEFENSE? THAT'S ACTUALLY A CHESS MOVE  WHERE IF YOU'RE LOSING YOU JUST  EAT YOUR OPPONENT'S QUEEN. HOW HAS A GUY WHO FIRED A  SHOTGUN GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH  THE VICE PRESIDENT?
HE CLAIMS HE WAS TRYING TO  SCARE OFF WOULD-BE CAR PROWLERS  BUT DEPUTIES SAY HE WENT ABOVE THE LAW.
I DID WHAT JOE BIDEN TOLD ME  TO DO. I WENT OUTSIDE AND FIRED MY  SHOTGUN IN THE AIR.
John: COME ON. HE DID NOT TELL YOU TO DO THAT. THERE IS NO WAY THAT BIDEN  LITERALLY TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD GO  AND GET A SHOTGUN AND FIRE TWO BLASTS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE.
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT  YOURSELF, GET A DOUBLE-BARREL  SHOTGUN. IF THERE'S EVER A PROBLEM JUST  WALK OUT ON THE BALCONY HERE,  WALK OUT, PUT THAT DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN AND FIRE TWO BLASTS  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. SNOB A LITTLE ADVICE FOR TRICK  OR TREATERSALITY JOE BIDEN'S  HOUSE, IF HE'S NOT OFFERING YOU A TREAT, RUN. LOOK, THIS MAN DIDN'T ACTUALLY  SHOOT ANYONE SO WHAT IS THE  PROBLEM.
PROSECUTORS AND SHERIFF  DEPUTIES SAY THE WAY THE LAW IS  WRITTEN DOESN'T AFFORD PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO JUST FIRE OFF THEIR  GUNS. THERE MUST BE A SELF-DEFENSE  COMPONENT.
John: THERE MUST BE A  SELF-DEFENSE COMPONENT. FOR EXAMPLE, SAY THE PERSON HAD  BEEN WEARING A HOODIE, THEN YOU  WOULD BE FINE. THIS IS A TOUGH CASE. ON ONE HAND PEOPLE PROBABLY  SHOULDN'T JUST FIRE SHOTGUN  BLASTS INTO THE AIR. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE VICE  PRESIDENT LITERALLY TOLD ME TO. THAT'S A PRETTY SOLID DEFENSE. YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM GOING TO RULE ON THIS. IF THERE'S ONE LEGAL PRECEDENT  SET BY THIS CASE, IT SHOULD BE  FOR GOD'S SAKE IGNORE JOE BIDEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
