[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- A BIPARTISAN DEAL HAS BEEN REACHED. A CEASE FIRE DECLARED IN THE PARTISAN BATTLES THAT HAVE RAVAGED WASHINGTON. ARE WE REALLY READY TO GIVE UP THIS FIGHT. BEFORE YOU SCREAM YES, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YES YOU MIGHT WANT TO WATCH THIS FROM JASON JONES.
YOU'VE SEEN THE SMASH HITS BUDGET BATTLE ONE, TWO, THREE AND FOUR. THEY HAD IT ALL, COUNTDOWN CLOCKS, COUNT-UP CLOCKS. COUNTING DOWN AND UP CLOCKS BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE CONGRESSIONAL SHUTDOWN GRAVY TRAIN IS PULLING INTO STATION.
CONGRESS MAY BE READY TO CALL A TRUCE IN THE ONGOING BUDGET WARS.
A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, A BUDGET DEAL.
BUT A BUDGET DEAL DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TIME TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.
THANK GOD IT'S OVER.
I WAS SO SICK OF COVERING THAT.
I NEVER WANT TO DO ANOTHER --
I'LL DO YOUR BUDGET STORY FOR YOU.
WHY? THERE'S NO STORY.
I'LL BRING YOU THE ANTAGONISTIC SOUND BITES, SILLY GRAPHICS AND A REAL SENSE OF IMMINENT FISCAL DOOM.
JONES, IT'S OVER.
IT'S OVER WHEN I SAY IT'S OVER.
BUDGET BATTLE 5. THE SEQUEL THAT THE 24 HOUR NEWS NETWORKS DEMAND. IT'S A FIGHT FOR RATINGS AGAINST IMPOSSIBLE ODDS. THIS JUST GOT REAL.
ACTUALLY NOT REALLY THEY'VE BEEN AT A STALEMATE FOR SOME TIME AND THEY ARE HOPING NOT TO SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT THIS TIME.
WELL, IT'S NOT HARD TO BELIEVE. DEMOCRATS WON'T DEAL WITH ENTITLEMENTS, REPUBLICANS NOT PUTTING TAX INCREASES ON THE TABLE.
KILLING THE MOMENTUM HERE TODD, SORRY.
SEARCHING FOR AN ANCIENT ENEMY.
COMING FROM WITHIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE DEBATES ON THE MONDAY-FRIDAY CONGRESS. WE ALL KNOW THAT ONE-HALF OF ONE-THIRD OF OUR GOVERNMENT COULD STILL (bleep) THIS UP.
SOME CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS ARE OPPOSED TO THE DEAL.  MARCO RUBIO SAYING HE OPPOSES THIS.
YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF THE BUDGET SAGA CONTINUES WITH A SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY REGINALD VELJOHNSON AS THE GUY HE ALWAYS PLAYS IN THINGS LIKE THIS.
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE, PAL.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GETTING A DEAL DONE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN USE.
DIDN'T TOUCH ENTITLEMENTS AND IGNORED TAX REVENUES.
TELL IT TO ME STRAIGHT.
THEY ARE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD.
ONE QUESTION:  DO WE GET TO WIN THIS TIME? >>, I THINK THAT'S FOR RAMBO.
DON'T CALL ME ON MY ACTION MOVIE REFERENCES. BUDGET BATTLE FIVE IT'S OVER WHEN I SAY IT'S OVER.
YIPPEE-KIAYE MOTHER (bleep).
