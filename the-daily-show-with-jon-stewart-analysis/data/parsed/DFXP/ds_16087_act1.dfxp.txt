IT WILL BE, THE LARGEST CHARACTER GAP WE HAVE EVER HAD. (LAUGHTER)
BETWEEN GUESTS. DENIS WAS WONDERING HOW I WAS GOING TO GET HIM TODAY. ANYWAY, TOOK LAST WEEK OFF. AND HAD A GREAT VACATION. WENT AWAY COMPLETELY UNPLUGGED. NO NEWS, NO TV, THREW MY CELL PHONE IN THE OCEAN WHICH CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS  LATER BUT AT THE TIME FELT PRETTY GREAT. SO LET'S PLUG BACK IN, WHAT I DID MISS?
THE PRESIDENT IS WORRYING THAT WE HAVE JUST NINE DAYS TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING OR  RISK DEFAULT.
THE NUMBERS OF JOBS CREATED LAST MONTH, JUST 18,000, THAT'S 100,000 FEWER  THAN EXPECTED.
INVESTIGATORS SAY 80% OF ATLANTA SCHOOLS CHEATED ON STATE STANDARDIZED TESTS.
Jon: WELCOME BACK. 80%, OR I GUESS AS IT IS KNOWN IN ATLANTA, AN A! PERHAPS NO SOUND BITE BETTER SUMMED UP, THOUGH, THE MORE AS THAT WE NOW FIND  OURSELVES IN MORE THAN THIS ONE.
HOLLYWOOD HOLDING NOTHING BACK. ASHTON KUTCHER TWEETING OJ SIMPSON FINDS THIS VERDICT OUTRAGE US.  -- OUTRAGEOUS.
HOLLYWOOD NOT HOLDING BACK. I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BUT ISN'T LIMITING YOURSELF TO 140 CHARACTERS THE  DEFINITION OF HOLDING BACK? OR IS THAT THE EXTENT OF THE FEELING. ASHTON REALLY WASN'T HOLDING BACK WOULDN'T WE HAVE A LINK TO HIS TOMB BELLER THIS IS  THE WEEK WE CELEBRATED AMERICA'S 235th BIRTHDAY. BROKE, UNEMPLOYED SHALL, ENDLESSLY DEPLOYED.
JON, JON, JON, YOU'RE HURTING. I KNOW THAT.
Jon: WOW!, JOHN OLIVER, HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
JON, I GOT HERE THE WAY THE BRITISH PEOPLE WHO BRING COMFORT HAVE TRAVELED FOR  HUNDREDS OF YEARS. A MAGIC CLOAK AND UMBRELLA. THAT IS HOW I GOT HERE. (APPLAUSE)
HOW DO I GET HERE EVERY DAY.
Jon: YEAH. I GUESS YOU SAW, I WAS AWAY FOR A WEEK, I COME BACK. THE NEWS IS JUST BLEAK AND I'M IN A BAD WAY.
I SAW THAT. CORRUPTION OF YOUR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE GOT ENYOU DON'T, HAVEN'T THEY, CHAPPY?
Jon: ONLY A TRUSTED FRIEND COULD THROUGH PERHAPS A COMPARATIVE BACK AND FORTH  PUT MY TROUBLES IN PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE --
HAVE NO FEAR ♪ ♪ ENGLAND'S HERE ♪  ♪ TO MAKE YOU FEEL ♪ ♪ A ITTLE ETTER ♪ ♪.
Jon: WHAT, WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO YOUR CON SON ANTS.
WE TOOK THEM HEM WHEN WE'RE ELPING EOPLE.
Jon: THAT'S CHARMING. I THINK ARE YOU IN OWN YOUR HEAD, QUITE FRANKLY. WE HAVE REAL TROUBLE IN THIS COUNTRY.
RIGHT, JON, WHAT WOULD ENGLAND KNOW ABOUT A DYING EMPIRE WITH ROTTING INSTITUTIONS. WELL, LET ME PRESENT YOU WITH EXHIBIT A, JON, THIS IS THE BRITISH TABLOID NEWS OF THE WORLD. 168 YEARS OLD AND AT THEIR PEAK THEY SOLD 8 MILLION COPIES A WEEK. AND REMEMBER, THAT'S IN A NATION WHOSE POPULATION IS ONLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE.
Jon: ACTUALLY ENGLAND I DON'T THINK THAT --
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, JON. THE POINT IS AS OF YESTERDAY IT'S OWNER RUPERT MURDOCH HIMSELF 166 YEARS OLD, SHUT  IT DOWN IN DISGRACE.
Jon: I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK MURDOCH IS --
AGAIN, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT (LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS, DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO DISGRACE A BRITISH TABLOID, JON? THE NEWS OF THE WORLD ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HIRED A PRIVATE DECT TOUGH LEARN IF  FREDDIE MERCURY HAD HIV, IT'S TRUE. ALSO THE PEOPLE WHOSE CRUSADE AGAINST PETA FILES LED TO A LYNCH MOB ATTACK. AND ATTACKS ON THE HOME OF A PEDIATRICIAN.
Jon: WELL, I COULD SEE HOW YOU COULD MAKE THAT MISTAKE, PETA FILE, PEDIATRICIAN. SO WONDERFUL, YOUR TABLOID REPORTERS ARE SCUM BAGS. OUR REAL PRESS, OUR LEGITIMATE PRESS IS TALLING DOWN ON THE JOB. POLITICAL COVERAGE IS ATROCIOUS. THEY WEREN'T JUST COVERING THE CASEY ANTHONY TRIAL. THEY FUNDED IT, LOOK AT THIS.
THE ANTHONY FAMILY IS PAYING FOR CASEY'S DEFENSE. IN PART, HER LAWYER SAYS, WITH MONEY FROM LICENSING HOME VIDEOS AND FAMILY PHOTOS TO ABC NEWS AND OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS.
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A $200,000 PAYMENT THAT WAS MADE TO HER AND HER ATTORNEY  BY ABC NEWS WHEN THIS FIRST BROKE.
Jon: ABC NEWS, $200,000. AND THAT WAS APPARENTLY ONLY AFTER SHE TURNED DOWN ABC'S OFFER TO BE THEIR NEXT BACHELORETTE. SO THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT. WHAT DID NEWS OF THE WORLD DO?
WELL, COMPARED TO THAT, I GUESS, I GUESS NOT MUCH, JON.
Jon: RIGHT.
JON, THIS.
THE PAPER HACKED VOICE-MAIL OF THE FAMILIES OF BRITAIN'S SOLDIERS KILLED  IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.
Jon: WOW!, WHY WOULD THEY EVEN --
I DON'T KNOW, JON, PERHAPS THE SAME REASON THEY ALSO DID THIS.
STAFFERS WITH THE NOW-DEFUNCT NUPTIALLY TRIED TO HACK INTO THE PHONE OF 9/11 VICTIMS.
Jon: SUDDENLY WE'RE ON A GAME SHOW. PRETTY [BLEEP] DEPRESSING.
IT'S VERY DEPRESSING.
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY NEED THE DETAILS OF VICTIMS OF 9/11.
WELL, NEIGHBOR MIGHT SELL ONE OR TWO EXTRA PAPERS, JON. BUT THE REAL CHERRY ON THIS  [BLEEP] SUNDAY WAS THE CASE OF POOR MILLY DOWLER, A MISSING 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL  THAT HAD BRITAIN RIVETED.
DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN SHE WAS MISSING THE NEWS OF THE WORLD WERE USING  A PRIVATE INVESTIGATER TO LISTEN HER VOICE-MAIL.
Jon: TO HELP IN THE SEARCH FOR THE --
MAYBE, MAYBE, JON, BUT JUST TO BE SURE, LET'S CHECK.
THE VOICE-MAIL BOX OF MILLY'S PHONE FILLED UP. THE NEWS OF THE WORLD WERE HUNGRY FOR MORE INFORMATION FOR MORE STORIES SO THEY  INTERVENED AND DELETED THE MESSAGES.
Jon: I THINK I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT.
BUT LET'S BE FAIR TO THEM, JON, NO HARM, NO FOUL, RIGHT?
THEY INTERVENED AND DELETED THE MESSAGES.
THAT GAVE HER FAMILY AND POLICE HOPE THAT SHE WAS ALIVE. MILLY WAS LATER FOUND MURDERED.
Jon: WHY DIDN'T THE POLICE --
THE POLICE THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. WHY DIDN'T SCOTLAND YARD STOP THEM. MAYBE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS.
ROUTINELY, THE NEWS OF THE WORLD WAS PAYING AT LEAST SOME POLICE OFFICERS  AT SCOTLAND YARD. [BLEEP], [BLEEP].
YEAH.
Jon: OH JESUS.
JON, DO YOU WANT A SNACK TAVER DOODLE. THEY'RE VERY BLAND.
Jon: CAN'T YOUR PRIME MINISTER OR ANYBODY --
THE PRIME MINISTER, THE PRIME MINISTER, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, DAVID  CAMERON, THE PRIME MINISTER.
Jon: YES.
LEADER OF NEW ENGLAND.
Jon: RIGHT.
A FUNNY STORY ABOUT HIM, JON. THE FORMER EDITOR OF THE NEWS OF THE WORLD, ANDY COULSON, THE ONE WHO PRESIDE  AT THE PAPER, SOME OF ITS MOST EGREGIOUS HACKING SCAN WILL DAS AND RESIGNED IN  DISGRACE WAS HIRED BY NONE OTHER THAN THAN, WAIT FOR IT, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT.
Jon: NO, NO, NO DOT.
YES, DAVID CAM'RON.
Jon: NO, [BLEEP] OH MY GOD, MY BALLS JUST CRAWLED BACK UP INTO MY BODY.
OH, GOD!
Jon: WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? OH, YOU PEOPLE ARE GAR BADGE.
YES, YES! YES, WE ARE.
Jon: ARE YOU TERRIBLE PEOPLE.
YES! AN JON, THE TRUTH IS, IT ONLY ENDED NOW FOR THE BRAVE REE OF ONE PERSON.
Jon: WHO? WHO IS THIS MOST BRAVE AND VALIANT BRIT WHO?
WELL, THIS INDIVIDUAL, JON, WENT UNDERCOVER WEARING A WIRE.
Jon: INCREDIBLE. WHO IS THE MOST VIRTUOUS PERSON IN ALL OF ENGLAND.
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU A SHOUTING FRAUDERGASM. JON, MAY I, JON, MAY I PRESENT TO YOU THE HERO OF THE STORY.
HUGH GRANT WAS THE CELEBRITY VICTIM OF THE PHONE HACKING AND HE EVEN  WEARS A WIRE TO SECRETLY TAPE A CONVERSATION -- WEAR A WIRE WITH A CONVERSATION  WITH A FORMER NEWS OF THE WORLD JOURNALIST WHO ADMITTED TO HACKING'S PEOPLE'S PHONES.
THAT'S RIGHT, THE GUY WHO GOT CAR HEAD FROM AN L.A. ROSE PROSTITUTE IS NOW THE MORAL COMPASS OF MY NATION. (LAUGHTER) SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS. LET ME JUST ASK YOU THIS, JON. DO YOU FEEL ANY BETTER ABOUT AMERICA YET? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT IS WEIRD.
WHAT.
Jon: I ACTUALLY DO.
THAT'S GOOD.
Jon: I FEEL KIND OF GOOD NOW.
AND THAT MEANS THAT MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT BUYING, YOU'RE JUST WALKING ON MY DESK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. YOU'RE NOT CRYING.
