Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. SIR. [APPLAUSE] LOOK AT YOU. SO WHAT IS IT NOW? YOUR TITLE WAS... TELL ME YOUR TITLE.
STILL IS CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR TWO MORE DAYS.
Jon: AND IN TWO DAY, WHAT DO?
I PACK THE STUFF UP IN THE MOVING VAN AND...
Jon: NEW YORK I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT ARE YOU GOING TO ANOTHER JOB?
WELL, YEAH, I'M GOING TO CREATE A PRIVATE SECTOR JOB BACK  AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO BUSINESS SCHOOL WHERE I TEACH. SO I'M GOING BACK.
Jon: WILL THAT COUNT TOWARDS YOUR JOB CREATION RECORD OR...
I HOPE SO. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LOOK AT YOU. CAN WE GET A SHOT OF HIS FACE.
NO.
Jon: YOU ARE GIDDY. >>LY ADMIT THAT THERE'S SOME ENJOYMENT THAT I'M GETTING OUT.
Jon: YOU'RE GIDDY. IS THE PRESSURE OF WORKING WITHIN GOVERNMENT SO PALPABLE? IS IT...
I'VE MOAN THE PRESIDENT A LONG TIME. HE WAS A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND THEN THAT'S WHERE WE KNEW EACH  OTHERMENT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR PROBABLY FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. ONCE YOU GET TO WASHINGTON, THERE'S ONLY SO LONG YOU CAN GO. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE WHOSE TRAY TABLES ARE NOT IN THE FULL UPRIGHT AND LOCKED POSITION. EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GET ON WITH IT. SO LOOK, I JUST FEEL BAD. THE PRESIDENT'S GOT TO SAY THAT.
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T HAVE. TO IF HE WANTS TO, YOU KNOW, LET'S MAYBE TRY AND DECONSTRUCT WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE PLACE THAT MAY SUCK YOUR SOUL OUT. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING. YOU HAD SAID SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING WHICH IS YOU STUDIED ECONOMICS. YOU STUDIED JOB CREATION, AND THEN YOU GO TO WASHINGTON AND THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT ALL  THOSE THINGS THAT... IT WOULD BE LIKE BEING A DOCTOR AND THEN YOU GO TO A PLACE TO PRACTICE  MEDICINE AND THEY GO, ACTUALLY NEW YORK, WE JUST DO A DANCE AND  DRINK COCOA, THAT'S HOW WE SOLVE THAT.
THAT'S NOT THE HEALTHIEST. LOOK, WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WHATEVER WERE THE WORDS THAT THE POLL, RIDICULOUS, DISGUSTING, WHAT HAVE YOU ABOUT THE DEBT CEILING DEBATE, THE LAST THING WE NEEDED, WE'VE TAKEN SOME  HEAVY BLOWS SO FAR THIS YEAR, OIL PRICES, THE STUFF FROM EUROPE, THE DISASTER IN JAPAN IN ADDITION TO BEING THE HUMAN COST  HAD THIS IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY. WE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE GROWTH AGENDA AND THE PRESIDENT FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, IT WAS WITH THE  ENTIRE FOCUS ABOUT U.S. MANUFACTURING, HE DID HALF DOZEN EVENTS AT DIFFERENT FACTORIES, ALL OF US MEMBERS OF THE CABINET WENT OUT TO DIFFERENT EVENTS. WE FOCUSED ON POLICY, FOREIGN, DIRECT INVESTMENT. NO ONE PAID ATTENTION. IT WAS ALL WHO POUNDED THEIR FISTS THE LOUDEST AND WHAT COLOR WAS THEIR TIE. THAT'S PART OF WASHINGTON... THAT PART OF WASHINGTON IS...
Jon: TO BE FAIR, GOING OUT TO COMPANIES IS ANOTHER FORM  OF... IT'S STILL JUST PROPAGANDA TO SOME EXTENT. IT'S NOT POLICY. IT'S LOOK AT ME, I'M IN A FACTORY. I'M GOING TO SHAVE PEOPLE'S HAND, CONGRATULATING THEM ON STILL HAVING JOBS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE EITHER.
LOOK, IT'S FAIR THAT A WAY TO DEMONSTRATE... WE'RE GOING TO  HAVE POLICIES, SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE CAN DO IN A BIPARTISAN BASIS. WHICH I STILL... THE NAIVE PART OF ME, WHY DON'T WE JUST DO THOSE. BOTH PARTIES AGREED ON FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT WE COULD DO AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT  TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY.
WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE... WE'LL DECONSTRUCT  IT A LITTLE BIT, TALK ABOUT THE EXACT THINGS WE COULD DO. THAT'S THE WAY TO DO THIS. LOOK AT YOU. I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE A BABY PACIFIER AND SOME GLOW STICKS. IT'S LIKE YOU'VE TAKEN ECSTASY. I'M GOING HOME,
