( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IF YOU  FOLLOW THE WORLD OF SPORTS  AND/OR HOMOSEXUALITY, YESTERDAY BROUGHT MAJOR NEWS IN BOTH.
JASON COLLINS BECOMES THE  FIRST PLAYER IN A MAJOR AMERICAN  TEAM SPORT TO COME OUT.
Jon: JASON COLLINS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). CENTER FOR THE WASHINGTON  WIZARDS. WHAT A SHOCK. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US EXPECTED  WE'D LIVE TO SEE THE DAY WHEN  THREE OPENLY GAY WIZARDS -- BECAUSE LET ME EXPLAIN. YOU SEE, OBVIOUSLY THE WIZARD  FROM HARRY POTTER BOOKS WAS GAY  ACCORDING TO J.K., WHICH IS (WHISPERING) SO NBA PLAYER COMES  OUT. CUE THE HATERS.
KOBE BRYANT TWEETED APPROVAL  TODAY OF COLLINS' COMING OUT.
COLLINS' DECISION IS BEING  PRAISED BY FORMER PRESIDENT BILL  CLINTON ON.
NBA COMMISSIONER DAVID STERN  SALUTED HIS LEADERSHIP MANTEOL  ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS  EXCELLED AT ONE OF THE HIGHEST  LEVELS IN SPORTS TO SAY THIS IS WHO I AM, I'M PROUD OF IT, I'M  STILL A GREAT COMPETITOR, I'M  STILL SEVEN FOOT TALL AND CAN BANG WITH SHAQ. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM  WITH COMING OUT. SUDDENLY EVERYONE WANTS TO PLAY  MATCH MAKER. HE'S SEVEN FEET TALL. YOU'RE SEVEN FEET TALL. YOU PLAY FOR THE WIZARDS. HE PLAYED A WIZARD. STILL, ALL IN ALL IT'S A PRETTY  GREAT DAY FOR MAJOR LEAGUE  SPORTS. AT LONG LAST THEY'VE DECIDED  THAT GAY PEOPLE ARE FIT TO BE  INCLUDED IN THEIR ELITE CLUB. ONE THAT'S ALREADY ALLOWED IN  ADULTERERS, WIFE SWAPPERS,  GAMBLERS, CHEATERS, RAPISTS, RACISTS, AND SLAUGHTERERS OF  MAN. THOSE WHO HAVE ABUSED SPOUSES,  DRUGS, ALCOHOL, FAMILY MEMBERS  AND ANIMALS. YES, AT LONG LAST HOMOSEXUALITY  IS NO LONGER A BAR TO A  PROFESSION WHERE YOU CAN ALREADY GET AWAY WITH CHOKING YOUR BOSS,  TEXTING YOUR DICK TO A COWORKER,  AND THROWING LIT FIRE CRACKERS INTO CROWDS OF CHILDREN. CONGRATULATIONS, GAY ATHLETES. YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HANG AROUND  WITH THESE [BLEEP] PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). FOR ME WE TURN TO SENIOR GAY  SPORTS CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES  LIVE AT THE VERIZON CENTER. JASON JONES. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OBVIOUSLY A PRETTY REMARKABLE  DAY DOWN THERE.
BIG DAY, JON. BIG DAY. FIRST ACTIVE NBA PLAYER COMES  OUT. IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE.
Jon: YOU DON'T SOUND LIKE THE  DYNAMITE WENT BOOM.
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I THOUGHT WHEN THIS DAY  CAME, IT WOULDN'T BE SO BORING. THE GUY IS A MODEL PLAYER. HE'S AT THE END OF HIS CAREER. HE COMES OUT IN A "SPORTS  ILLUSTRATED" STORY.
Jon: THAT WAS AN INDECREED  EBL MOVING AND POETIC ESSAY.
DID YOU READ IT. Jon: I READ A TWEET ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. NO ONE WANTS ESSAYS IN THEIR  NBA. THIS IS THE GAME OF GOLD CHAINS,  TATTOOS, DENNIS RODMAN. LOOK AT WHAT I'M WEARING, JON,  AND I'M JUST COVERING THE SPORT. I GUESS FROM A PRO BASKETBALL  PLAYER, I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE  FLAIR, YOU KNOW. WHOSE HOUSE? COLLINS' HOUSE.
Jon: HOW DO YOU THINK HE  COULD HAVE COME OUT WITH MORE  FLAIR?
HE COULD HAVE DONE IT DURING  THE SEASON WHEN HE WAS PLAYING  FOR THE TEAM AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIKED IT. WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE COME OUT  WHILE BEING THE MIAMI HEAT'S TOP  SCORER?
Jon: THAT'S LeBRON JAMES. YES. WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE COME OUT  WHILE BEING LeBRON JAMES? DURING HIS DECISION SPECIAL HE  COULD HAVE SAID, "I'VE MADE MY  DECISION. I'M TAKING MY TALENTS TO  MMMMMMMMEN."
Jon: NO. ACTUALLY, WHAT IF HE HAD BEEN  JEREMY LIN AND HE CAME OUT  DURING LIN-SANITY, IT COULD BE LIKE MAN-SANITY OR LIN-MANTY. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING IN THERE.
THOSE KINDS OF PUNS WOULD  HAVE WON ME THE GESPY.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT? THE GAY ESPY. Jon: IS THAT A REAL THING? IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF JEREMY  LIN HAD COME OUT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, ISN'T IT KIND  OF PROGRESS THAT HIM COMING OUT  ISN'T ALL THAT BIG OF A DEAL?
ABSOLUTELY, JON. IT'S JUST... IT'S NEVER GOING TO  LIVE UP TO MY FANTASY, YOU KNOW. THE 98 FINALS, BULLS VERSUS  JAZZ. GAME 6. 11 SECONDS LEFT. MICHAEL JORDAN, COVER BY  RUSSELL. JORDAN PUSHES OFF, FACE BACK AND  IN THE AIR SHOUTS, "I'M GAY."  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). AND THEN SWISH. BACK BOARD SOMEHOW SHATTERS  GLASS FALLS TO THE FLOOR SPELLS  OUT YOU GO GIRL, CHEERS, HUGE VICTORY FOR CIVIL RIGHTS.
Jon: YOU'RE RIGHT, JASON  JONES. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR FOOTBALL. WE'LL WAIT FOR FOOTBALL.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. DON'T BLOW IT FOR ME TE
