Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WELL, IN THIS YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE RICK SANTORUM HAS BEEN SURGING ALL OVER-- LEV LAUGH--   (LAUGHTER)
Jon: RICK SANTORUM IS DOING VERY WELL, FOR MORE ON SANTORUM'S NEW FOUND SUCCESS  WE TURN TO CERTIFICATERIER POLITICAL ANALYST JOHN OLIVER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON, RICK SANTORUM MIGHT BE FEELING GOOD ABOUT HIS RISE IN THE POLLS BUT HE'S  ABOUT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN WHO IS.
SANTORUM IS NOT AN IDEAL CANDIDATE. HE SEEMS TO ENJOY THOSE DEBATES, A LITTLE TOO MUCH T SCARES PEOPLE.
THE POINTS HE IS BRING UP ARE HURTING THE PARTY. HE SHOULD NOT AND WILL NOT BE OUR NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT.
Jon: WOW. NOW WHY, WHAT IS IT ABOUT SANTORUM THAT HAS REPUBLICANS SO ALARMED.
BECAUSE, JON, AS YOU SAW IN THE DEBATE HE'S A LITTLE TOO OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT  HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS.
Jon: BUT THEY ARE CONSERVATIVE THOUGHTS AND CONSERVATIVE FEELINGS. WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?
BECAUSE, REPUBLICANS AREN'T IDIOTS, JON. THEY KNOW THAT AMERICA LOVES ITS CONSERVATISM CUT WITH PLENTY OF BAKING POWDER. BECAUSE ONE HIT OF THE PURE STUFF AND YOU'LL WAKE UP WITH ERIC STOLTZ STRANGLING  YOU AND PLUNGING AN ADRENALINE NEEDLE-- NEED IL-- NEEDLE INTO YOUR HEART  AND SANTORUM DOESN'T GET THAT LOOK HOW HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF DON'T ASK  DON'T TELL.
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS PLAYING SOCIAL EXPERIMENTATION WITH OUR MILITARY RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S TRAGIC. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT GOING FORWARD, WE WOULD REINSTITUTE THAT POLICY OF  RICK SANTORUM WAS PRESIDENT, PERIOD. NICE GOING, [BLEEP]. YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT! DONLT PEOPLE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. HERE'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID.
WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND JOBS. BUT GIVEN THE FACT YOU ARE INSISTENT, THE ANSWER IS I BELIEVE THAT DON'T ASK DON'T  TELL SHOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT IN PLACE UNTIL CONFLICT WAS OVER.
Jon: SO HE IS SAYING IT'S OKAY THEN FOR GAYS TO BE IN THE MILITARY AS LONG AS WE  ARE NOT FIGHTING. IS THAT --
IS HE SAYING THAT, JON? IS THAT WHAT IS SAYING? OR DO YOU THINK HE'S SAYING SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD AGREE WITH EVEN MORE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO YOU ARE SAYING SO HE'S SAYING EVERY NOTHING.
PRECISELY. PRECISELY, JON.
Jon: I GET THAT.
JUST LIKE THE CONTRACEPTION DEBATE WHICH SANTORUM WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO MAKE ABOUT CON  EXTRA-- CONTRACEPTION.
MANY CHRISTIAN IN THE 235I9 SAID WELL, THAT'S OKAY, YOU KNOW, CONTRACEPTION IS OKAY. IT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S A LIFE SENTENCE TO DO THINGS IN A SEXUAL REALM THAT IS COUNTER TO WHAT  CATHOLICS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.
IS THIS YOUR FIRST DAY IN POLITICS, RICK? YOU JUST MADE THIS ABOUT CONTROLLING A WOMAN'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BASED ON  IMPOSING YOUR CODE OF MORALITY UPON OTHERS.
Jon: BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
RIGHT, BUT YOU DON'T TELL THEM THAT! JON, THIS IS WHAT YOU TELL THEM.
IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT CONTRACEPTION, IT'S ABOUT VIOLATING OUR FIRST  AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND CONSCIOUS.
I'M A RELIGIOUS MAN. SI HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR LADY PARTS. (LAUGHTER)
I JUST WISH TO PRAY IN PEACE.
Jon: SO I GUESS IT'S LIKE THE STATE'S RIGHTS ARGUMENTS  DURING THE EARLY 60 ITSEE. IT WAS REALLY ABOUT HE IS GROWGATION BUT YOU NEED SOME KIND OF AGREED UPON CODE TO --
EXACTLY. AND RICK, THE [BLEEP] JUST GAVE EVERYONE THE ENIGMA MACHINE. JON, LOOK AT THE WEALTH GAP. NOW THAT SAY TOUCHY SUBJECT. A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS THINK THERE IS SOMETHING UNFAIR IN OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM. BUT YOUR PLATFORM IS DARWINNIAN FREE MARKET. SELL IT.
THERE IS INCOME INEQUALITY IN AMERICA. THERE ALWAYS HAS BEEN. AND HOPEFULLY, AND I DO SAY THAT, THERE ALWAYS WILL BE.
WE DO NOT ACCEPT THAT OURS WILL EVER BE A NATION OF HAVEs AND HAVE NOTS. WE MUST ALWAYS BE A NATION OF HAVEs AND SOON TO HAVEs.
YOU SEE?
Jon: OKAY.
MITCH DANIELS IS USING A DOG WHISTLE WHERE SANTORUM IS USING ONE OF THESE. OUT, JESUS.
DOW HEAR THAT, JON.
Jon: YES.
YOU CAN HEAR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THIS. DOW HEAR THAT.
Jon: OKAY, YES, STOP IT! >>S SO HE'S NOT AFRAID TO STATE EXPLICITLY REPUBLICAN DOGMA. IT'S KIND OF REFRESHING THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IN DEBATES. PUT IDEAS OUT THERE IN THE MARKETPLACE IN THEIR BARE FORM, AND LET THE VOTERS DECIDE, FREE MARKET.
NO, NO, NO. WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT, JON. AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHY. BECAUSE THEN VOTERS HAVE TO TAKE YOUR PLATFORM TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS. FOR INSTANCE, RICK SANTORUM IS PRO-LIFE. CONSISTENTLY IN A PRINCIPLESED WAY IN ALL SITUATIONS. SO LET'S PLAY THAT OUT, WE.
I BELIEVE AND I THINK THE RIGHT APPROACH IS TO ACCEPT THIS HORRIBLY CREATED, IN  THE SENSE OF RAPE, BUT NEVERTHELESS GIFT IN A VERY BROKEN WAY, THE GIFT OF  HUMAN LIFE AND ACCEPT WHAT GOD IS GIVING TO YOU, AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO, LOTS OF  DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE HAVE HORRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE HORRIBLE, BUT NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE TO  MAKE THE BEST OUT OF A BAD SITUATION.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING HE JUST NEEDS TO HAVE LIKE A SOON TO HAVE MITCH DANIELS  TYPE EUPHEMISM FOR YOU HAVE TO CARRY YOUR RAPE BABY.
EXACTLY.
Jon: SO THAT'S WHY ROMNEY GETS THE NOMINATION.
PRECISELY, JON. NOT THAT THE REPUBLICANS WANT ROMNEY, THEY JUST ACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO THEM. (LAUGHTER)
THIS HORRIBLY CREATED GIFT, AND OUT OF SOMETHING BAD, TO MAKE THE BEST.
Jon: OF A BAD SITUATION.
OF A BAD SITUATION.
Jon: THANK YOU, JON OLVER, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
