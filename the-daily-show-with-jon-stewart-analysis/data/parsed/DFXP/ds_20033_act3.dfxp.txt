>>Jon: WELCOME BACK, TONIGHT MY GUEST,  THE LEGENDARY TV PRODUCER. HIS NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "EVEN THIS I GET TO EXPERIENCE." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM NORMAN LEAR! NORMAN! COME ON. VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. NORMAN LEAR!
YES!  WHAT A NIGHT, WHAT A NIGHT TO BE HERE.
Jon: WHAT A NIGHT. SO LOOK AT THIS BOOK HERE, "EVEN THIS I GET TO EXPERIENCE." I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RAISING ME.
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS -- THIS LAST PIECE WAS -- NO WONDER MY WIFE AND GO TO BED WITH YOU EVERY NIGHT.
Jon: OH, REALLY, THAT'S--  (LAUGHTER)
EVERY NIGHT.
Jon: MY EARS ARE BURNING. HOW -- FIRST OF ALL, YOU -- KIDS TODAY, THEY HAVE EVERYTHING AT THEIR FINGERTIPS. THEY CAN DOWNLOAD THINGS, THEY HAVE IT. THEY CAN WATCH THINGS WHEN THEY WANT. ALL IN THE FAMILY, MAUDE, THE JEFFERSONS, THIS WAS APPOINTMENT TELEVISION. I CAN REMEMBER AS A KID, THE ANTICIPATION AND EXCITEMENT WHEN YOUR SHOWS WERE GOING TO BE COMING ON. YOU OWNED TELEVISION BACK THEN.
I WAS WORKING AS HARD AS YOU WORK TODAY.
Jon: NO.
NO TRULY, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING. WE WERE ALL WORKING OUR ASSES OFF.
Jon: YEAH.
TO MAKE THE BEST TELEVISION WE THOUGHT WE COULD. THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT WE WERE ALL SERIOUS PEOPLE. COMEDY WAS OUR BUSINESS. YOU'RE A VERY SERIOUS MAN. THAT WAS A VERY SERIOUS, HILARIOUS PIECE.
Jon: WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, SIR. I APPRECIATE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT THAT'S WHERE, WHERE I THINK I LEARNED HOW TO PROCESS COMPLEX THOUGHTS, THINGS THAT I REALLY CARED ABOUT, THROUGH THE LENS OF COMEDY WAS WATCHING NORMAN LEAR SHOWS. BECAUSE THAT'S-- AND AT THAT TIME IT WAS ASTONISHING. I MEAN AT THAT TIME IT WAS THE BANANA SPLITS AND THE HUDSON BROTHERS. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ARCHIE BUNKER COMES ON THE SCENE AND ALL IN THE FAMILY, AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES UNDERLYING THE AMERICAN CULTURE CAME RIGHT OUT.
WHAT COULD MAKE ME PROUDER THAN TO HAVE SAT THROUGH THOSE LAST FEW-- I HAVE TO REPEAT IT AGAIN. THAT WAS SO BRILLIANT.
Jon: OH, THANK YOU. WHEN YOU, BUT YOU STRUGGLED, THOUGH, FOR A WHILE, RIGHT? LIKE YOU -- >>I HAD  A LOT OF YEARS OF STRUGGLING.
Jon: RIGHT. TELL ME ABOUT THAT. WHAT WAS IN YOUR MIND, DID YOU THINK I'M GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION HERE. DID YOU THINK PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR THESE TYPES OF ISSUES THROUGH A NARRATIVE?
YOU KNOW, I DID, THE FIRST BIG BREAK, ED SIMMONS AND I HAD WAS THE DEAN MARTIN AND JERRY LEWIS COLGATE COMEDY HOUR.
Jon: WOW.
ON THE COLGATE COMEDY HOUR IT DEBUTED. AFTER THE SHOW I WAS HAVING DINNER WITH MY AGENT AND HIS WIFE. AND I WAS CRYING BECAUSE JERRY LEWIS HAD DESTROYED THE SCENE, I THOUGHT, THAT WE HAD WRITTEN FOR HIM.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION-- OR HE DID PAY ATTENTION TO THE SCRIPT BUT HE LEFT THE SCRIPT OFTEN. NOW WE WE WROTE A SCENE THAT HAD SOME MEANING FOR US, AND THAT'S WHY I WAS CRYING. BUT HE DELIVERED THE SCENE SO WELL, THAT THEY HAD TO APOLOGIZE TO THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY, BECAUSE THIS WAS A SCENE ABOUT TELEVISION DESTROYING THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY. AND THEY MADE A PUBLIC APOLOGY.
Jon: REALLY?
YES, AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY. AND OUR SCENE HAD SCORED. SO THERE WAS SOMETHING ON OUR MINDS AT THE VERY FIRST BEGINNING.
Jon: RIGHT.
AT THE VERY FIRST, MY CAREER.
Jon: IS THAT SOMETHING-- SO YOU WENT INTO THIS VERY CONSCIOUSLY DECIDING THAT YOU WEREN'T JUST GOING TO WRITE ANY KIND OF COMEDY, YOU WERE GOING TO WRITE SOCIAL COMEDY.
I DIDN'T GO INTO IT WITH THAT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE ASSUMED I HAD SOME CONSCIOUS OF FORETHOUGHT.
Jon: I GET IT, ALL RIGHT. FAIR ENOUGH. FAIR ENOUGH. FIRST NIGHT "ALL IN THE FAMILY" COMES ON, THIS IS GROUND BREAKING TELEVISION.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHAT WAS YOUR EXPECTATION OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THIS ARCHIE BUNKER CHARACTER, THIS PLAIN-SPOKEN, LOVABLE BIGOT GETS INTO AMERICAN TELEVISION LIVING ROOMS. WHAT WAS THE NETWORK WORRIED ABOUT? WHAT WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?
WELL, THE NETWORK WAS WORRIED ABOUT-- IT WAS 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE SHOW WENT ON THE AIR.
Jon: UH-HUH.
IN NEW YORK WHEN I GOT A CALL THAT THEY WERE PUTTING THE SHOW ON AIR. BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE LINE THAT THEY WISHED OUT. THE BUNKERS ARE RETURNING FROM CHURCH BECAUSE HE HATED THE SERMON AND HE HATED THE  PASTOR. AND THE KIDS HAVE THE HOUSE ALONE, MIKE AND GLORIA AND THEY'RE GOING UPSTAIRS. THEY COME IN AND INTERRUPT THAT. AND ARCHIE SAYS, HE GETS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THE MEANING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND HE SAYS 11:10 ON A SUNDAY MORNING. THAT WAS IT.
Jon: OH MAN.
THAT HAD TO COME OUT. NOW WHEN I SAID WHY? THEY SAID IT MAKES IT VERY EXPLICIT. THE "IT" MAKES IT-- 11:10 ON A SUNDAY MORNING, THAT NAILS WHAT THEY'RE HAVING-- WELL, LET THAT BE. HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MARRIED? THEY'RE GOING UPSTAIRS, THEY'RE MARRIED.
Jon: YES.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
Jon: MARRIED PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE SEX IN THE MORNING.
I THINK SO. SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD FOR THEM. ANYWAY, THEY INSISTED THAT THAT COME OUT. NOW IT SOUNDS, I DON'T MEAN IT AS A TRIBUTE TO BRAVERY AT ALL. I HAD THE COMMON SENSE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT LITTLE THING, IF I GIVE UP ON THAT LITTLE THING, I WAS DEAD FROM THERE ON. THEN NO MATTER WHAT CRAZY, SILLY THING. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST PLAIN SILLY. I ALSO HAD A THREE PICTURE DEAL OFFERED TO ME BY UNITED ARTISTS.
Jon: SO YOU HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING-- YOU HAD A LITTLE FALLBACK.
YEAH.
Jon: WELL, IT'S A VERY EXCITING. CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT?
I WOULD LOVE TO.
Jon: ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING HAVE NORMAN LEAR STICK AROUND. THE BOOK IS CALLED "EVEN THIS, I GET TO EXPERIENCE," IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. THE GREAT NORMAN LEAR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
