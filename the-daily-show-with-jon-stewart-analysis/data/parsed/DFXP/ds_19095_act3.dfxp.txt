Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A NEW YORK METS LEGEND. IS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "MOOKIE:   LIFE, BASEBALL AND THE 86 METS." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MOOKIE WILSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MOOKIE WILSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AN HONOR TO SEE YOU HERE.
GREAT.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: REALLY THE LAST TIME IN MANY YEARS THAT I CAN ACTUALLY SAY THAT TO A NEW YORK MET.
ROUGH TIMES HUH?
Jon: IT'S BEEN SOME ROUGH TIMES. THIS REALLY WAS. YOU KNOW, YOU WRITE ABOUT 1986. THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY INDELIBLE ABOUT A CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON THAT MAKES IT WORTHY OF REMEMBRANCE. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE 86 TEAM WHEN YOU GUYS WON THE WORLD SERIES? BESIDES THE DRAMATIC FASHION?
I THINK IT'S THE CHARACTERS. I THINK WE WERE A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WASN'T AFRAID TO BE THEMSELVES. I THINK YOU NEED MORE OF THAT IN SPORTS.
Jon: MORE OF THAT?
YES.
Jon: BUT YOU WERE, YOU KNOW, THE 86 TEAM HAD DOC GOODEN, DARYL STRAWBERRY. KEITH HERNANDEZ.
YES.
Jon: BUT, YOU WERE A BEACON OF MATURITY IN THAT.
OOOH, THAT'S GOOD.
Jon: DON'T YOU THINK? YOU WERE THE ONE GUY EVERYBODY LOVED AND NOBODY EVER WORRIED ABOUT. YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT KEITH HERNANDEZ AT SOME POINT, 6:00 IN THE MORNING SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE LIKE WHERE IS KEITH? MOOKIE WILSON NEVER HAD THAT ISSUE.
I THINK THE TEAM -- WE HAD THIS GROUP OVER HERE THAT WAS REALLY OUTGOING. A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLED THEM THE SCUM BUNCH. YOU KNOW. [LAUGHTER] THEN YOU HAD THIS OTHER GROUP OVER HERE THAT WAS REALLY, YOU KNOW, GARY CARTERS, RON DARLING AND THEN YOU HAD THOSE GUYS IN THE MIDDLE LIKE MYSELF AND RAFAEL SANTANA THAT KINDA KEPT IT ALL TOGETHER.
Jon: AND THAT CHEMISTRY?
YES.
Jon: AND IT BRINGS UP THIS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS DONALD STERLING, THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A RACIST OWNER, SPORTS REALLY IS AN UNUSUALLY ALMOST PATERNAL SITUATION WITH THE OWNER. THEY CAN SHIP YOU OUT TO ANOTHER CITY. DO THE PLAYERS FEEL THAT RELATIONSHIP?
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THAT WEIRD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLAYERS, YOU KNOW, AND MANAGEMENT KNOWING THAT MANAGEMENT DOES HAVE THE LAST WORD. IT SOMETIMES DOESN'T MATTER HOW WELL YOU PLAY. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PLAYER AND OWNERSHIP. NOW, THIS BASKETBALL SITUATION IS A REALLY, REALLY DIFFERENT WHEEL. A LOT OF RACIST REMARKS AND HERE HE OWNS A TEAM THAT IS WHAT 80% BLACK?
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.
Jon: THAT IS WEIRD. BUT, YOU FIND IN THESE LEAGUES THE OWNER IS TYPICALLY WHITE. THE ATHLETES, TYPICALLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN. THE ATHLETES WHO ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAD TO FIGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO PLAY AND EVEN NOW STILL HAVE TO FIGHT FOR RIGHTS. THIS IDEA THAT, OK, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE AT SEVEN YEARS BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THIS AMOUNT OF TIME. DO YOU THINK IS COULD BE A TURNING POINT IN THAT RELATIONSHIP?
I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK SPORTS HAS SURVIVED. I MEAN,  OVER THE YEARS AS MUCH AS WE'VE TRIED TO MESS BASEBALL UP, WE HAVEN'T WITH STRIKES AND ALL THAT. THE GAME WILL SURVIVE. I THINK, YOU CAN MAKE ALL THE RULES YOU WANT TO BUT UNTIL YOU CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF IDIOCY NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IT'S JUST GOING TO HAPPEN. >>Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. AS A PLAYER, HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT KIND OF, I MEAN, THESE GUY GUYS ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PLAYOFF RUN. NOW, YOU PLAYED IN NEW YORK. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DISTRACTION. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MEDIA. THEY ARE THIS THE SAME IN LOS ANGELES. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR AN ATHLETE AT THAT HIGH LEVEL TO STILL COMPETE WITH THIS TYPE OF EMOTION UNDER THE SURFACE?
WELL, FIRST AND FOREMOST IS ATHLETES DEAL WITH PRESSURE. EVERY DAY THEY GO ON THE FIELD IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT DO YOU THAT DAY. THIS IS NO DIFFERENT. THEY ARE NOT PLAYING FOR THE OWNER. THEY ARE PLAYING FOR THEIR OWN SELF RESPECT. AND YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD THINGS ABOUT OH SHOULD THE TEAM BOYCOTT AND NOT PLAY. THAT SERVES NO REAL PURPOSE. I MEAN, IT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF YOU BEING THERE, PLAYING BASKETBALL AT THE NBA LEVEL THAT'S A GREAT, GREAT HONOR AND TO LET SOME IDIOT NOT LET YOU FULFILL THE POTENTIAL THAT YOUR TEAM HAS I THINK YOU WOULD BE DOING YOURSELF A DISSERVICE AND THE LEAGUE ITSELF.
Jon: SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT YOU HAVING THE MATURITY? LOOK AT ME.  I'M READY TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE, JUST WALK AWAY FROM THE GAME AND YOU BROUGHT ME BACK. HERE IS WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAPPEN.
YES. OKAY.
Jon: THE CLIPPERS RALLY AROUND THIS, THEY PLAY UNBELIEVABLE BASKETBALL FOR THE NEXT MONTH. THEY WIN THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP.
YEAH.
Jon: AND IN THE LOCKER ROOM IN THE JUBILATION THE TROPHY IS HANDED TO THEM. DONALD STERLING IS RIGHT THERE AND THEY GET THE TALLEST GUY. LET'S GO WITH BLAKE GRIFFIN, HE'S ABOUT 6'11''. AND HE JUST HOLDS THE TROPHY UP LIKE THIS AND DONALD STERLING IS -- HE HAS THIS -- CAN'T GET IT. AND DONE. THEY DON'T LET HIM HAVE IT. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU STILL, ARE YOU STILL ABLE TO GET TOGETHER WITH SOME OF FELLAS AND REMINISCE ABOUT IT? YOU KNOW, TRAGICALLY GARY CARTER OF COURSE PASSED AWAY. GREAT CHARACTER GUY. ARE YOU ABLE TO GET TOGETHER AND SORT OF REVERT BACK TO FORM FROM THE 80s AND HAVE A GREAT TIME TOGETHER?
WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. WE DO GET TOGETHER AND WHEN WE DO IT'S ONE BIG REUNION. WE TALK A LOT AND WE LIE A LITTLE BIT, TOO.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT REMINISCING IS ALL ABOUT.
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
Jon: AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE LAST CHAMPIONSHIP THE METS EVER WON. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO SEE YOU AND TO HAVE YOU HERE ON THE SHOW. GET YOURSELF "MOOKIE." ONE OF THE GREATS. MOOKIE WILSON, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
