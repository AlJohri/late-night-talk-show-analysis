[  APPLAUSE  ] WE'RE BACK AND TALKING  TO STEVEN BRILL. HE HAS WRITTEN A SERIES CALLED "BITTER PILL" OF ARTICLES IN TIME MAGAZINE. YOU WERE MENTIONING HOW THESE INSURANCE SUBSIDIES WILL BE THE TAXPAYERS BASICALLY PAYING TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE INSURANCE SCHEME THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE. BASICALLY WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR THEIR PRODUCT THAT WE DON'T FEEL PARTICULARLY GREAT ABOUT.
FOR WHICH THEY THEN PAY DRUG COMPANIES, HOSPITALS, DOCTORS, MRI PROVIDERS, VERY HIGH PRICES. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES --
Jon: CAN'T THEY BARGAIN? ISN'T THAT A BETTER SYSTEM THAN PEOPLE GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY INSURANCE, SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR THAT, ISN'T THAT THE TAXPAYERS ALSO?
SUPPOSE YOU HAVE ONE HOSPITAL UP IN THE NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT AREA. AND SUPPOSE YOU WANT TO SELL HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE NEW HAVEN, CT AREA. HOW WOULD YOU BARGAIN WITH THAT HOSPITAL?
Jon: WELL I'D COME IN AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND SAY HOW IS YOUR FAMILY?
THAT IS A WAY.
Jon: I WOULD TRY TO INGRATIATE MYSELF TO THEM.
MAYBE GOVERNOR CHRISTIE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BARGAIN... [ LAUGHTER ] THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO.
Jon: SO THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY CAN'T GO IN THERE. DO THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THAT OR IS THIS SOMEWHAT OF A SYMBIOTIC, COLUSIONAL RELATIONSHIP WHERE, HEY WE'RE ALL MAKING OUR MONEY-- I MEAN I GUESS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T MAKE THE KIND OF MONEY THAT THE HOSPITALS AND DRUG COMPANIES MAKE. >>THEY DON'T MAKE THE KIND OF MARGINS, AND ALSO
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES PRETTY MUCH DON'T INSURE ANYTHING. THEY ARE CLAIMS PROCESSERS. A LARGE EMPLOYER IS ON THE HOOK. THEY HIRE AETNA, CIGNA, WHOEVER IT IS, JUST TO PROCESS THE CLAIMS. SO THAT'S NOT REALLY THE ISSUE IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE ISSUE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS EVERYTHING ELSE. DO WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, ANY KIND OF MALPRACTICE REFORM THAT WOULD STOP HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS FROM HAVING THE REASON OR THE EXCUSE TO OVERTEST PEOPLE? DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF CONTROLS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THE WAY EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD DOES? DO WE DO ANYTHING IN TERMS OF ANTI-TRUST ENFORCEMENT TO DEAL WITH HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION? AND DO WE JUST CLAMP DOWN ON PRICES?
Jon: ULTIMATELY WHAT DOES THIS DO THEN? BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SYSTEM-- LET'S SAY THIS IS THE CASE. NOW THE INSURANCE COMPANY KNOWS I HAVE AN UNFETTERED SUPPLY OF NEW CUSTOMERS THAT ARE MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BUY MY PRODUCT.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHY CAN'T, IN THE WAY A DISCOUNT AUTO INSURANCE COMPANY COMES IN, LIKE A GEICO, WHY CAN'T THAT OCCUR WITHIN THE INSURANCE WORLD? LET'S SAY A SMALL LIZARD WITH AN ACCENT COMES IN WITH A --
THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD DO IT IS IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLIERS TO DO WHAT IS CALLED A NARROW NETWORK. YOU SAY, ALL RIGHT I'M GOING TO BARGAIN WITH ONE OF SIX HOSPITALS IN THIS AREA AND I'M GOING TO SAY TO THAT HOSPITAL I'M SENDING ALL OF MY PEOPLE TO YOU IF YOU GIVE ME THIS DISCOUNT. THAT IS HAPPENING IN SOME PLACES LIKE IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER, WHEN THAT HAPPENS, THEN YOU HAVE THE OPPOSITION TO OBAMACARE SAYING, LOOK WHAT IT'S DONE. NOW YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR OWN DOCTOR. YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR OWN HOSPITAL.
Jon: EVEN IN THE CASE OF THE FAMILY WITH THE CANCER PATIENT. THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT NETWORK NOW THAT THEY'VE --
THEY HAVE GOOD DECENT COVERAGE BUT THE SIMPLE FACT OF LIFE IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO SQUEEZE THOSE PRICES DOWN YOU MAY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE NARROW NETWORKS BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT IF THERE'S ONLY ONE HOSPITAL IN TOWN.
Jon: BUT THEN WHAT IS THERE TO PREVENT THESE INSURERS  FROM CONTINUING TO RAISE THE RATES? WHERE ARE THE PRICE CONTROLS ON EVEN THE INSURANCE RATES?
IF THE PREMIUMS GO UP FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE EXCHANGES, GUESS WHO PAYS?
Jon: I'M GOING TO GO WITH US? I'M LOOKING AT HIM. YOU PAY. >>Jon: RIGHT. YOUR TAX BRACKET IS PROBABLY HIGHER THAN MINE.
Jon: SEE HERE'S THE CRAZY THING. I DON'T MIND PAYING FOR THE CARE. I JUST WANT A SYSTEM  THAT MAKES SENSE. IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE WELL IN THIS COUNTRY SUBSIDIZE AT A HIGHER LEVEL A SMART SYSTEM, BUT WHAT I OBJECT TO IS A CORRUPT SYSTEM THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY BEING REFORMED IT'S MERELY BEING EXPANDED.
WE SPEND TWICE PER CAPITA ON HEALTH CARE THAN JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY AND OUR HEALTH CARE RESULTS ARE WORSE OR ALMOST AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRY,  SO THAT'S IT IN A NUTSHELL. WE SPEND MORE ON EVERYTHING  WHETHER IT'S AN X-RAY OR CAT SCAN OR PRESCRIPTION DRUG BECAUSE WE LIVE IN IN THE ILLUSION HERE THAT THIS IS SOME KIND OF FREE MARKET AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE MORE SKIN IN THE GAME AS GEORGE WILL SAYS. THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.
Jon: HERE IS WHERE IT GETS DICKENSIAN: SO NOW YOU HAVE THESE STATES THAT, TO BE POLITICALLY OBSTRUCTIONIST OR TO STAND  UP AND FLY THE FLAG OF FREEDOM, THEY'VE DECIDED NOT TO EXPAND THEIR MEDICAID COVERAGE. SO NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE MAKING BELOW THE LEVEL OF WHERE THEY COULD BE SUBSIDIZED BUT THEY CAN'T GET SUBSIDIES. NOW THEY HAVE TO PAY WHAT? FULL PRICE TO GET COVERED?
IF YOU MAKE $5,000 OR $20,000 A YEAR IN TEXAS, YOU WILL BE -- YOU'LL PAY $800 OR $900 OR $1500 A MONTH FOR COVERAGE, WHICH OF COURSE YOU WON'T BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. IF YOU MAKE $80,000 YOU'LL GET A SUBSIDY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU, RICK PERRY. IT'S THIS RIDICULOUS CATCH 22. NOW THE CORE OF IT IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED WHEN THEY OK'D OBAMACARE THAT THE ONE THING THEY DIDN'T OKAY WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FORCING THE STATES TO TAKE THE 100% AID TO EXPAND IT BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A BIG DEAL AFTER ALL WHAT STATE WOULD TURN DOWN 100% TO COVER ITS POOR PEOPLE. ANSWER:  LOTS OF REPUBLICAN STATES.
Jon: SURE. REAL AMERICA. YEAH.
YOU SAID THAT NOT ME I'M A JOURNALIST.
Jon: EXACTLY. AND I'M ANGRY. THE PIECE "BITTER PILL" IT APPEARS IN THE NEW ISSUE OF TIME MAGAZINE AND IT'S A MONTHLY COLUMN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.  PLEASE COME BACK AND KEEP US INFORMED.  STEVEN BRILL. [  APPLAUSE  ] STEVEN BRILL. [  APPLAUSE  ]
