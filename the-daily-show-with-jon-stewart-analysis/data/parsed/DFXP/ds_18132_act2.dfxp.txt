( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WELCOME BACK. CONGRESS BECOMES THE LEAST  PRODUCTIVE IN HISTORY, HAVING  PASSED JUST 15 BILDZ. WHAT WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT,  KIND OF PERSON ASPIERS TO BE A  MEMBER OF THIS ILLUSTRIOUS CLUB.
AMIDST RECORD LOW APPROVAL  RATINGS, BOTH PARTIES ARE ON THE  HUNT FOR PROMISING CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES TO HEAD TO D.C. SO WHEN LETTIESIA PEREZ, AN  UP-AND-COMING DEMOCRAT, CAPTURED  THE SUPERVISOR SEAT IN A STRONGLY REPUBLICAN CALIFORNIA  COUNTY, THE D.N.C. KNEW JUST  WHAT TO DO.
I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM THE  CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY  WHICH SAID, "WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU. WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE A RISING  STAR IN CALIFORNIA, AND WE'D  LIKE TO YOU CONSIDER POTENTIALLY A RUN FOR CONGRESS."
IT'S SUCH A GREAT JOB. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY  EXCITED.
ACTUALLY, I HAD TO SAY NO.
YOU DECIDED TO SAY NO TO D.C.
THAT'S RIGHT. I DID. RESOUNDINGLY.
Reporter: AND HER  RESOUNDING NO EFF'ING WAY HAS  BECOME A WORRYINGLY COMMON  REFRAIN. ACROSS THE NATION, THE PARTIES  ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND ANYONE  WILLING TO RUN FOR CONGRESS. BUT WHY?
IT'S NO SECRET, THERE IS  REMARKABLE GRIDLOCK IN D.C. I DON'T WANT TO BE AT A PLACE  WHERE I HAVE A GOOD, FANCY TITLE  BUT I'M NOT ACTUALLY ABLE TO DELIVER FOR PEOPLE.
WAIT A MINUTE. SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT. OKAY, I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON  HERE. THIS HESITATION OF YOURSELF TO  GO TO D.C., IS IT SCANDAL BASED?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
DRUG USE?
NO.
YOU'RE NOT A CITIZEN.
I'M ABSOLUTELY A CITIZEN, AND  PROUD.
YOU HAVE SENT PICTURES OF  YOUR PENIS OVER THE INTERNET.
NEVER, WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER  IT.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU CONSIDER  THAT?
ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A HIGH  DUTY OF MORALITY, OF ETHICS, OF  PERSONAL, PROFESSIONAL CONDUCTS.
DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO  WITH THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE A  PENIS?
THE QUESTION WAS WOULD I  CONSIDER SENDING PICTURES AND I  WOULD NOT.
DO YOU HAVE A PEENS OR NOT?
I DON'T.
NO SCANDAL, NO PEENS, SHE'S  AN AMAZING CANDIDATE. CLEARLY PEREZ DOESN'T UNDERSTAND  THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF  SERVING IN THE U.S. CONGRESS. LUCKILY, STEPHEN LATOURETTE, AN  18-YEAR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE AND  SUBCOMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN KNOWS FIRSTHAND THE PROFOUND  SATISFACTIONAVE REWARDING CAREER  GIVING VOICE TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. GIVE ME THREE WORDS THAT SUM OF  YOUR EXPERIENCE.
FRUSTRATING, MADDENING,  GRIDLOCK.
OKAY. THREE WORDS THAT AREN'T THOSE  WORDS.
UHM, SAD  DISAPPOINTING, DIFFICULT.
OKAY, FORGET ABOUT WORDS. I'M LOOKING TO INSPIRE SOMEBODY  TO RUN FOR CONGRESS.
YOU'D HAVE TO BE CRAZY TO RUN  FOR CONGRESS.
WHY?
THE LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE  IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT GAMING  THE OTHER PARTY SO THAT THEY CAN BE IN CHARGE THAN THEY ARE IN  ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING  SOMETHING. POTENTIAL CANDIDATES SHOULDN'T  BE MOTIVATED BY ACCOMPLISHING  ANYTHING.
OKAY, THIS SOUND LIKE AN  OBJECTIVELY TERRIBLE JOB. IF WE WANT TO GET SOMEONE LIKE  PEREZ TO RUN FOR CONGRESS, WE  ARE GOING TO HAVE TO RECALBRIGHT HER EXPECTATIONS SO SHE  LIBRARIES TO LOVE D.C., DESPITE  THE 535 OBVIOUS FLAWS.
WELL, I DON'T SEE MUCH  COMPROMISE TAKING PLACE IN D.C. I WANT TO TALK. I WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU  WANT. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THE BROKEN  MACHINE OF THE U.S. CONGRESS  NEEDS TO KEEP LIMPING ALONG.
IT'S NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR  ME.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MANAGE  TO KILL THE THING INSIDE OF YOU  THAT THINKS AND CARES AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.
I COULD NEVER KILL ANYTHING  INSIDE OF MY THAT'S CARES ABOUT  PEOPLE. IT'S WHAT FUNDAMENTALLY DRIVES  ME.
WOW, WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. WASHINGTON IS TOO GRIDLOCKED TO  ATTRACT THE KIND OF  RESULTS-ORIENTED POLITICIANS WE NEED TO BREAK THE GRIDLOCK. SO THE QUESTION REMAINS-- WHO  WILL RUN FOR CONGRESS?
I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE SO  BLATANTLY PARTISAN THAT THIS IS  FUN FOR THEM. THEY'RE RUN.  I THINK THE GOAL IS  TO FIND PEOPLE THAT AREN'T... BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING ME WHO I  THINK WOULD BE MOST INTERESTED  IN THE JOB, IT'S PROBABLY THE.
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE U.S. CONGRESS 2014. ... WANTED. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: THANK YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT B
