WELCOME BACK. OBVIOUSLY THE BERGDAHL SWAP HAS BEEN AN ISSUE OF CONTROVERSY. BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING EVERYONE CAN AGREE ON, IT'S THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER.
I THINK IT'S A BAD DEAL.
A BIG MISTAKE.
I WAS NOT SATISFIED.
I WOULD HAVE DONE EVERYTHING SHORT OF ENDANGER THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.
WELL, I WOULDN'T RELEASE THESE MEN.
EVER?
NOT THESE MEN.
WE CAN GO IN AND USE MILITARY FORCE.
Jon: TURNS OUT WE COULD HAVE DONE EVERYTHING, BUT THE THING WE DID. THAT WAS ONE THING WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE. WE'RE SO STUPID. OBAMA IS TOTALLY THAT GUY WHO'S LIKE, "WHAT'S THIS BUTTON DO?" NO! DON'T PRESS THAT BUTTON. THAT'S THE BAD BUTTON. AND IT'S NOT JUST OBAMA WHO SCREWED THIS WHOLE POOCH. BERGDAHL'S DAD AGAIN.
I'VE GOT A 26-YEAR-OLD SON, AND IF MY SON IS OUT ON THE WIRE AND HE IS OUT THERE WITH FELLOW TROOPS AND HE WRITES ME UP AND SAYS HE HATES AMERICA AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT DESERTING AND HE'S THINKING ABOUT LEAVING HIS POST, I CAN TELL YOU AS FATHER OF THAT 26-YEAR-OLD OR 23-YEAR-OLD SON, I'D SAY, JOEY, YOU STAY THE HELL RIGHT THERE. I WOULD CALL HIS COMMANDER. I WOULD SAY, GET MY SON, HE'S NOT WELL, GET HIM TO A MILITARY BASE IN GERMANY.
Jon: AND THEY WOULD DO IT. BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING THIS MILITARY DOES IS TAKE ORDER FROM FATHERS WHO CALL THEM UP. [LAUGHTER] DUDE, YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T EVEN GET LITTLE LEAGUE COACHES TO DO WHAT YOU WANT. JUST PLAY HIM. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE FROM JESSICA WILLIAMS AND JASON JONES IN WASHINGTON, D.C. HEY GUYS, NICE SEE YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LISTEN. SO,  ALL THIS OBVIOUSLY MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING, IS THIS THE RIGHT DEAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO?
NO.
JON, I'M GOING TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH JASON BECAUSE THE ANSWER IS HELL NO. OBAMA GAVE UP FIVE PIECES OF TOP TALIBAN TALENT. HUGE MISTAKE. IF I HAD BEEN PRESIDENT, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BERGDAHL BACK FOR SOME SECOND STRINGER LIKE ABD AL-RAHIM AL-NASHIRI AND WHATEVER'S IN MY POCKET. LOOKS LIKE $1.75.
Jon: $1.75?
THAT IS STILL WAY TOO MUCH. IF I WERE PRESIDENT, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BERGDAHL BACK FOR AN 8 GIG iPHONE 3 AND PACK OF GUM, AND NOT EVEN GOOD GUM, THE GUM THAT SQUIRTS THAT TOOTHPASTEY JIZZ IN YOUR MOUTH, THAT GUM.
Jon: IT'S CALLED FRESHEN UP, AND SOME OF US HAPPEN TO THINK THAT WAS AN ADVANCE IN GUM TECHNOLOGY.
EW, JON, EW.
Jon: BUT LISTEN. I KNOW THIS HYPOTHETICAL. WHAT IF THE TALIBAN HADN'T BEEN WILLING TO EXCHANGE THEIR HIGH-VALUED PRISONER FOR POCKET CHANGE AND GUM THAT SQUIRTS?
[BLEEP] THAT.  MAKE 'EM DO IT.
BOOM. NICE ONE, JAY.
Jon: BERGDAHL'S FATHER?
OH, YOU MEAN BEARDIE McTALIBAN? THAT'S GUY'S A TOOL, JON.
HE'S NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN OF GUYS WHO WILL DO ANYTHING TO RESCUE THEIR P.O.W. SON.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, IF MY SON UP AND WALKED OFF HIS POST AND GOT CAUGHT BY THE TALIBAN, I'D MAKE THAT KID SIT DOWN AND SMOKE A WHOLE CARTON OF CIGARETTES.
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD HELP.
OH, OKAY, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY KIDS, JON?
Jon: NO, I JUST, I MEAN BERGDAHL HIMSELF, THE GUY'S A P.O.W. WHAT WAS HE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHAT ELSE IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO?
THERE'S PLENTY, JON. IT'S TALIBAN PRISON. SECURITY'S PROBABLY PRETTY LOOSE. LET'S SAY IT'S DUSK.
EXACTLY, AND THERE HE IS, THE HOSTAGE, HIS LEAN BODY BRONZED FROM THE HARSH AFGHAN SUN. HE'S WRAPPED IN CHAINS.
A CLOSE ANGLE ON HIS SURPRISINGLY MUSCULAR ARM.
HE FLEXS, SHATTERING THE BONDS THAT HOLD HIM AGAINST HIS WILL.
OH, NO, HE DIDN'T.
UH-HUH.
SUDDENLY 20 GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF THE MIST.
I SUMMON MY YEARS OF KARATE TRAINING.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT? YOU'RE THERE NOW? WHAT ARE YOU, JASON STATHAM?  IS IT BERGDAHL OR YOU THAT'S STUCK IN PRISON?
IT DOESN'T MATTER, JON. MY MANLY FISTS FLY INTO ACTION. GIVE 'EM SOME OF THAT. THEN I GIVE THEM A BIG [BLEEPED] KICK. THEN I'D RIP MY [BLEEPED] PANTS. I REALLY RIPPED MY PANTS.
Jon: NO. THAT'S WHY YOU ARE NOT GOING OVER THERE. YOU WOULD BE IN A TUNIC. YOU'D BE WEARING A TUNIC.
I'D GRAB A GUN AND DO A BACKFLIP OFF THE ROOF AND SLOWLY ROTATE THROUGH THE AIR AS I MOW DOWN MY REMAINING CAPTORS.
CUE THE SMOKE AND THE SMOKE CLEARING AND THERE SHE STANDS.
A TOTALLY HOT TALIBAN LADY PLAYED BY SOPHIA VERGARA. AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. [HUMMING PORN MUSIC].
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
THAT MEANS WE BANG.
BUT RESPECTFULLY, THROUGH A SHEET.
Jon: THAT'S HASIDIC. THAT'S A DIFFERENT -- THEN I GRAB MY HORSE AND RIDE TO FREEDOM.
AND THAT $120 MILLION OPENING WEEKEND.
AND THAT'S HOW YOU BRING A HOSTAGE HOME, JOHNNY.
ALL RIGHT. JESSICA WILLIAMS AND JASON JONES, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
