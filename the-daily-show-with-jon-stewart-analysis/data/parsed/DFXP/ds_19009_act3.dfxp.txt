[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE MAP AND THE TERRITORY." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM ALAN GREENSPAN. SIR -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU? PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT HERE MY FRIEND.
YES, SIR.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED THE MAP AND THE TERRITORY.
CAN WE WAIT UNTIL I STOP LAUGHING.
Jon: YOU LIKE IT BACK THERE? CHOCOLATE BACK THERE. IT'S A GOOD TIME. I'M VERY TALENTED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO IN 2008 YOU ARE THE FED CHAIRMAN, IN 2008 YOU TESTIFY THAT THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS FINANCIAL COLLAPSE THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE COMING WAS THAT YOU THOUGHT THE BANKS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER STEWARDS OF THEIR OWN CAPITAL, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SELF REGULATORS.
YEP.
Jon: AND THAT THIS BOOK WAS YOUR JOURNEY INTO FINDING OUT WHY THEY WERE TERRIBLE. PLEASE -- HAVE AT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT WHY WERE THEY TERRIBLE AT REGULATING THEIR OWN RISKS?
I DON'T THINK THEY FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE TYPES OF RISKS THAT WERE OUT THERE. IT'S INTERESTING IN THE FINANCIAL BUSINESS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHY MARKETS BEHAVE AS THEY DO. IT'S TOUGH. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO IT VERY EASILY, BUT WE REALLY CAN'T FORECAST ALL THAT WELL. WE PRETEND THAT WE CAN BUT WE REALLY CAN'T. AND MARKETS DO VERY WEIRD THINGS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN -- IT REACTS TO THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE SCREWY. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU JUST LEARNED THIS? [LAUGHTER] PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SCREWY. IT'S GREED, ISN'T IT, IT'S GREED AND HUBRIS, NO?
YEAH, BUT IT'S ALSO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. LOOK, I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE CANYONS OF WALL STREET AND I KNOW WHAT SCREWINESS IS. I WATCHED IT ALL OF MY LIFE. WHAT IS VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE -- THAT IS THOSE OF US WHO DID ANALYSIS -- ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SCREWINESS WOULD WASH OUT AND THAT ALL YOU HAD TO LOOK AT WAS THE REAL NUMBERS IN THE REAL WORLD. THAT WAS WRONG. AND I'LL TELL YOU IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO CONVEY BUT THE SIMPLE PREMISE WHICH WE ALL MADE WAS THAT PEOPLE WOULD ACT RATIONALLY IN THEIR LONG-TERM SELF INTEREST MADE A HUGE IMPACT IN HOW YOU VIEWED HOW THE ECONOMY WOULD FUNCTION.
Jon: EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIMPLE NUMBERS, THESE GUYS ARE, YOU KNOW, TAKING 30 TO 1 RISKS ON STUFF THAT THEY ARE NOT CAPITALIZED ON. THAT'S NOT EVEN STUDYING HUMAN BEHAVIOR. THAT'S LOOKING AT A BASIC BALANCE SHEET AND GOING WHAT IS THIS?
PRECISELY. >WE BEGAN TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE THAT DISREGARDING OF THEIR OWN COMPANIES. HOW CAN YOU RUN, AS YOU SAY 30 TIMES --
Jon: ON THE LEVERAGE. ISN'T IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY THE PENALTY. THE REWARDS THEY WERE GETTING, THE SYSTEM WAS INCENTIVIZED FOR THE CRAZY SHORT-TERM BURSTS OF REWARDS.
BACK IN 1970, THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE SAID THAT BROKER DEALERS WHICH IS WHAT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE COULD INCORPORATE. PRIOR TO THEN THEY WERE ALL PARTNERSHIPS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP. YOUR PARTNERS DON'T LET YOU TAKE ANY RISK THAT CAN AFFECT THEM. I REMEMBER THEY WOULDN'T LEND YOU A NICKLE OVERNIGHT AND THE SYSTEM WORKED. IT DID NOT GET ANYBODY FAILING BECAUSE THE EQUITY WAS PROTECTED. AS SOON AS THEY STARTED TO GO TO CORPORATIONS, THEY TOOK RISKS FOR EXACTLY THE REASON YOU SUGGESTED.
Jon: DIDN'T WE THEN DEREGULATE THE CORPORATIONS AND ALLOW THEM TO TAKE THE RISKS. BECAUSE A LOT OF SAFEGUARDS IN THERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BUSTS AND BOOMS BUT THEY ARE NOT AS LARGE BECAUSE THERE WERE CLEAR CUT REGULATIONS IN PLACE THAT CONTROLLED HOW MUCH THEY COULD LEND OVERNIGHT OR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY COULD SPECULATE FROM THEIR SAVINGS HOLDINGS TO THEIR MORE SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE BUSINESSES.
THE EASIEST THING TO DO IS TO INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IF THEY WANT TO DO THINGS WHICH MAKE NO SENSE, WHATEVER, LET THEM DO IT AND LET THEM SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES BUT DON'T PUT THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN DEFAULT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM IN ALL OF THESE AREAS ARE, THE FACT THAT WHEN A BANK FAILS, IT TENDS TO CREATE A CONTAGIOUS EFFECT AND RUMBLES THROUGH THE SYSTEM.
Jon: SURE.
THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2008.
Jon: RIGHT.
THOSE OF US WHO LOOKED AT THAT SORT OF STUFF RECOGNIZE THAT YOU JUST CAN'T TELL WHICH ARE GOING TO BE THE TOXIC ASSETS. SO I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS TO GET ENOUGH REGULATORY CAPITAL IN PLACE AND THEN THEY CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE -- SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING 12-1, WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE? 10:1, 20:1.
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE AT 11%. I THINK IT SHOULD BE TWICE THAT.
Jon: ARE THEY GOING TO DO IT?
NO.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR -- [LAUGHTER] CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A SECOND. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT WAYS THE SYSTEM CAN BECOME MORE AGILE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING THE PREVIOUS WARS AND THEY ARE ALREADY FAR BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO CATCH UP WITH THEM.
