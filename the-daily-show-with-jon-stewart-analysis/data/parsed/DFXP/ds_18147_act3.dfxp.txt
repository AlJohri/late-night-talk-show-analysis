WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE STARS  IN SHOW TIME'S DEXTER  CURRENTLY IN ITS FINAL  SEASON.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU  SOMETHING.
WHAT?
HARRISON AND I ARE LEAVING  SOON.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ARE YOU  LEAVING, YOU ARE LEAVING  WHERE.
LEAVING MIAMI, WITH  HANNA.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING  ABOUT?
WE'RE MOVING TO ARGENTINA.
ARE YOU KIDDING? DO YOU KNOW HOW STUPID THAT  SOUNDS. YOU ARE A GOING TO TAKE YOUR [BLEEP] SON AND MOVE TO A  COUNTRY WITH A WANTED  FUGITIVE. HAVE YOU THOUGHT  THIS THROUGH.
I HAVE.
Jon: WHAT'S WITH THE  CURSING. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM MICHAEL C. HALL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HELLO, BROTHER! MY FRIEND, NICE TO SEE YOU  AGAIN.
YOU TOO.
THIS, I GOT TO TELL YOU  THIS DEXTER HOW MANY YEAR, 8  YEARS.
YEAH, 7 YEARS, THAT'S  LIKE COLLEGE TWICE.
IS THERE-- I KNOW YOU  LOVE DOING IT IT IS A  WONDERFUL SHOW. IS THERE ANY PART OF YOU  THAT THINKS I'M GOING TO BE  SOMEWHAT RELIEVED NOT TO  HAVE TO KILL SO MANY PEOPLE ANY MORE?
YES, ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. I MEAN I TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE  IN WHAT WE'VE DONE  COLLECTIVELY. BUT YEAH THERE'S A SENSE OF  RELIEF THAT I'M NOT-- I  THINK IT DOES SOMETHING TO  YOU, EVEN IF IT'S JUST A  SIMULATION. LIKE IN FACT WE FINISHED AND  MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS WHAT  HAVE I DONE. (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, LIKE I MEAN, I  KNOW AGAIN SIMULATION BUT I FEEL  LIKE THERE IS SOME PART OF ME THAT RECORDED THIS AS IF  IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
Jon: THERE IS SOMETHING  LIKE THAT. I KNOW FOR ME IT HAS BEEN A  LOT OF YEARS AND I TAKE OFF  MAKEUP EVERY NIGHT BUT I IMAGINE IF THAT WERE LET'S  SAY, I DON'T KNOW, BLOOD,  THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT.
THERE'S ALSO THE WORRY  THAT I WAS EXORCISING SOME  DEMONS DOING THE SHOW THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIND  ANOTHER WAY TO EXORCISE  WITHOUT ACTUALLY KILLING  PEOPLE.
Jon: YEAH, THAT WOULD BE  BETTER.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU KNOW, LIKE I DON'T KNOW,  RACQUETBALL.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH,  SOMETHING. BUT ALSO THE CHARACTER, THE  MORTICIAN.
YEAH.
Stephen: THE SERIAL KILLER,  I WANT TO SEE MICHAEL HALL'S  GOOD TIME FUN HOUR.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU IN A BUNNY SUIT  JUST HOPPING. NOBODY DIES.
NOBODY DIES.
Jon: IT'S JUST UNICORNS  AND RAINBOWS.
I HAVE A MOVIE COMING OUT,  FIRST FRAME OF THE FILM, MY  CHARACTER, DEAD.
Jon: WHAT IS HAPPENING  HERE?
I TURNED THE TABLES ON  MYSELF BUT I STILL CAN'T GET  AWAY FROM THE DEAD BODIES.
Jon: I HAVE TO SAY THIS  THOUGH, I'VE NOTICED WITH  DEXTER THAT  WHEN YOU WERE EARLY LIKE THE YOUNGER SERIAL KILLER GUY,  BODY COUNT YOU WERE KNOCKING  THEM OFF WEEK-TO-WEEK, NOW IT TAKES FIVE EPISODES.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
Jon: IT'S NOT THE SAME.
GET OUT THE SARAN WRAP  AND DO THIS.
TRUE.
Jon: YOU SLOWED DOWN A  LITTLE BIT.
I KNOW. HE'S TRYING TO HAVE HIS CAKE  AND KILL IT TOO. IT'S LIKE HE'S TRYING TO  HAVE REAL FRIENDSHIPS AND  REAL RELATIONSHIPS. AND IT'S A MESS.
Jon: DO YOU FIND, YOU  KNOW, THAT AS YOU BEGIN TO  WIND DOWN WITH THIS, THAT THE FAMILY THAT YOU GUYS  HAVE ASSEMBLED, LIKE THERE'S  A MELANCHOLY, A FEELING OF EXCITEMENT BUT ALSO THERE IS  A STRANGE MELANCHOLY.
A VAGUE SENSE OF SADNESS.
Jon: IT'S LIKE A FAMILY.
IT'S VERY MUCH SO I'M  SURE YOU CAN RELATE TO THAT,  HAVING SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS YOU HAVE HERE.
Jon: I DON'T --
KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING  ABOUT?
Jon: I TRY NOT TO MAKE  EYE CONTACT WITH ANYBODY. I TREAT THIS LIKE NAM, YOU  KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO IS  GOING TO GET FRAGGED NEXT SO I'M NOT LOOKING.
YOU DON'T DECORATE YOUR  OFFICE.
Jon: I DON'T DECORATE THE  OFFICE.
LIKE A PRISON CELL.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY, YEAH,
TRULY. AND IT'S JUST A SERIES OF  GOOD-BYES. THE WHOLE LAST SEASON, THE  FIRST EPISODE WAS THE FIRST  LAST EPISODE, THE LAST FIRST EPISODE, WHAT-- AND AS  PEOPLE HAD THEIR LAST SCENES,  YOU KNOW, IT IS A CUMULATIVE SENSE OF, WELL, SADNESS AND  AN END.
Jon: DO THEY KEEP IN  TOUCH I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH  EXPERIENCE IN THIS BUT ON THE FILM WE DID OVER THE  SUMMER, WE ALL CAME TOGETHER,  VERY INTENSE EXPERIENCE, WE WERE ALL, AND THEN AS YOU  WENT THROUGH IT, THEY WOULD  BE LIKE THAT'S A PICTURE  WRAP AND THAT PERSON  DISAPPEARED FROM THE EARTH.
YEAH.
Jon: LIKE IT WAS KIND OF  WEIRD AND IT TOOK AWHILE TO  ADJUST TO IT EMOTIONALLY.
IT'S AN AWKWARD THING. YOU CAN'T REALLY ASSIMILATE  THE ENTIRETY OF EIGHT YEARS  WHEN YOU ARE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO SOMEONE ONE AFTERNOON  WHEN IT'S THEIR LAST SCENE,  HARD TO WRAP YOUR HEAD  AROUND.
Jon: YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THIS  IN ANOTHER SERIES. THERE SOMETHING THAT STAYS  WITH YOU, I FIND LIKE WITH  MY HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS IF WE GET TOGETHER AGAIN, BOY,  YEARS JUST FALL-- IN FIVE  MINUTES.
ARE YOU RIGHT BACK THERE.
Jon: SO IS THERE THE  FEELING OF SECURITY THAT  WHEN YOU RECONNECT WITH THEM YOU KNOW THE EASE IN WHICH  YOU GET ALONG WILL BE THERE.
YEAH, I HAVE THAT. I SAW LAURYN AMBROSE WHO  PLAYED MY SISTER ON SIX FEET  UNDER RECENTLY AND THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE, SORT OF BACK  AND FORTH THAT WE HAD. AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN  YEARS AND I HAVE THAT WITH  MEMBERS OF THAT FAMILY. AND I HOPE THAT WILL HAVE  THE SAME WITH DEXTER PEOPLE.
Jon: THAT WILL BE LOVELY. YOU KNOW WHAT MI GOING TO DO  IN THE FILM THAT I WAS  FILMING, I'M GOING TO FRIEND THEM ON-- ON SOME TYPE OF  SOCIAL MEDIA.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THEN WE'LL  UPDATE EACH OTHER.
MAYBE YOU COULD SEND  PHOTOS WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING  DIRECTLY INTO THEIR EYES AND THEY CAN HAVE AN EXPERIENCE  THEY'VE HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE.
Jon: ARE YOU TOTALLY A  SERIAL KILLER. YOU'RE [BLEEP] CRAZY! NO, IT'S GREAT. CONGRATULATIONS SO MUCH ON  THE SHOW. IT'S SO WELL DONE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: SUCH A GOOD SHOW. APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. DEXTER AIRS ON SHOWTIME  SUNDAY NIGHTS AT 9, HOW MANY  MORE EPISODES THREE, TWO.
THERE ARE THREE LEFT  STARTING SUNDAY.
Jon: THREE LEFT, MAN, SO  CHECK THEM OUT. I WANTED THOSE OTHER PEOPLE  DEAD. IS IT REALLY CALLED KILL  YOUR DARLINGS.
YEAH.
Jon: SON OF A BITCH.
I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT.
Jon: MICHAEL C. HALL,  NICE TO SEE YOU.
PLEASURE.
