FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: JON STEWART IS STILL  NOT HERE. HE'S ACTUALLY UPSTATE IN THE KIT  SKILLS. THE OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS FROM  THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN  RELATIONS. RICHARD HAASS WILL BE WITH US. BEFORE WE GET STARTED LAST NIGHT  JUST BEFORE WE WENT ON AIR, THE  ROYAL BABY WAS BORN. SO WE TURN OUR COVERAGE TONIGHT  JUST BEFORE SHOW TIME THERE WAS  BREAKING NEWS ABOUT ANTHONY WEAN SER... WEINER. SO WE WILL COVER ANTHONY  WEINER'S TOMORROW WHICH SPOILER  ALERT IS DOING A LOT MORE THAN ANTHONY WEINER HAS BEEN DOING. FOR NOW, ROLL IT. (TRUMPET FANFARE). [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS A BOY. AND FINALLY WE HAVE A MEMBER OF  THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH AN ACTUAL  EXCUSE FOR BEING A TOOTHLESS, PET LUNT, USELESS HUMAN BEING. THAT WILL GET ME IN TROUBLE BACK  HOME. THIS BOY CAME INTO THE WORLD  WITH SO MUCH POMP AND  CIRCUMSTANCE IT'S HARD TO...
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOW  BEING PUT ON THE EASEL. IN FACT, IT IS THERE. IT IS NOW BEING CHAINED IN TO  THE FAMOUS GOLDEN EASEL AT  BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
THE GOLDEN EASEL. DON'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT. YOU'LL MAKE IT DIRTY WITH YOUR  PEASANT EYES. INCIDENTALLY THAT EASEL IS  TRADITIONALLY USED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SOME FOUND OUT BY EASEL AND  OTHERS IN THIS WAY. (INAUDIBLE) GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!
John: OKAY. I'M ENGLISH AND I HAVE NO IDEA  WHAT THAT MAN JUST YELLED. IS THAT HOW THE QUEEN FOUND OUT? PRESSING HER FACE UP AGAINST THE  WINDOW AND HEARING (YELLING) A  BABY!
WILLIAM IS HOLDING HIS NEW  CHILD IN HIS ARMS. HE WILL PHONE THE QUEEN AND SAY,  HELLO, GRANNY, IT'S A BABY.
John: IT'S A BABY. THAT GENUINELY IS WORTH  MENTIONING. JUST HOW INBRED IS THIS FAMILY? REALLY? YOU KNOW, YOUR GREAT AUNT GAVE  BIRTH TO SOMETHING ELSE. OF COURSE, HOW COULD ANYTHING  INVOLVING THE QUEEN...
THE QUEEN LIKES TO GO TO BED  AROUND 9:00 P.M. U.K. TIME.
WE'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS AS  NIGHT WAS APPROACHING BECAUSE  YOU CAN'T ROUSE THE QUEEN AFTER 10:30 OR SO AT NIGHT.
John: THAT'S RIGHT. OH, THAT IS TRUE. IF THAT BABY HADN'T COME OUT  BEFORE 9:00 HE WAS GOING TO BE  PUSHED BACK IN. YOU DID NOT DISTURB HER MAJESTY. NOW, THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE  QUEEN WASN'T INTIMATELY INVOLVED  IN BIRTHING PROCESS.
THE QUEEN'S GYNECOLOGIST HAS  BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THIS  PREGNANCY AND LABOR.
John: AS A SOCIETY WE WILL  NEVER SPEAK ALLOWED OR EVEN  THINK THE PHRASE "THE QUEEN'S GYNECOLOGIST" EVER AGAIN. ONCE THE WORD AND THE BABY WERE  OUT, IT WAS SHOW TIME. THERE WERE CANNONS. THERE WAS THE TRADITIONAL DAVID  BECKHAM WELCOME. AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL THE  ROYAL OCCASIONS THE SONG WITH  ELTON JOHN THIS TIME DRESSED AS A BABY AND SINGING "I JUST CAN'T  WAIT TO BE KING."  BRITAIN CELEBRATED IN ITS  TRADITIONAL WAY: BY DRINKING.
BUCKLEBERRY WHERE KATE'S  PARENTS LIVE.
KATE AND WILLIAM,... John: I'M SORRY. CAN WE STOP IT RIGHT THERE. GO BACK A BIT. WAS THERE A HORSE IN THAT BAR? YES! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE'S AN ACTUAL HORSE. NOT ONLY WAS THERE A HORSE. BUT IT WAS WATCHING TELEVISION  WITH EVERYONE ELSE. THAT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST  THING ON THE PLANET. NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THERE'S A  HORSE IN THERE BUT BECAUSE THAT  HORSE IS CLEARLY THERE SO OFTEN. IT'S NOT THE LEAST BIT  SURPRISING. YOU GET THE SENSE THAT IF THIS  HORSE WALKED IN AND THE  BARTENDER SAID, "WHY THE LONG FACE," THE HORSE WOULD SAY," I  HAD A ROUGH DAY AT WORK. NOW GIVE ME A BOTTLE OF LAGER  AND EMPTY SOMETHING INTO MY FEED  BAG."  YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE MEDIA WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE THIS BABY  ARRIVE SO THEY COULD TURN THEIR  ATTENTION TO OTHER PRESSING  ISSUES.
I HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTION. WHEN DO WE GET TO FIND OUT THE  NAME OF THE BABY?
WHAT IS HIS NAME? GEORGE IS THE NAME. EVERYONE SAYS IT'S GEORGE.
SOME OF THE HEAVY BETTING IS  ON JAMES.
ARTHUR. PHILIP. LOUIS ARE ALL TOP CONTENDERS. IT MIGHT BE PRINCE CHARLES'  UNCLE LOUIS PRINCE MOUNT BATTON.
PRINCE CHARLES' NAME WASN'T  ANNOUNCED FOR ALMOST A MONTH. THEY DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT IN  ENGLAND.
WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. I WOULDN'T DISAGREE WITH YOU  RIGHT UP UNTIL I SAW THAT HORSE  IN A BAR. BUT SOMETHING WAS SAID YESTERDAY  WHICH WAS JUST FALSE.
THE QUEEN HAS TO BE  DELIGHTED.
John: NO. JUST NO. THE QUEEN IS IS NOT NECESSARILY  DELIGHTED BY THIS BECAUSE SHE IS  NO LONGER DELIGHTED BY ANYTHING. HER FACE WILL ALWAYS LOOK  EXACTLY HOW IT ALWAYS LOOKS. A MIXTURE OF BOREDOM. WHETHER IT'S WATCHING THE  SPECTACULAR OPENING CEREMONIES  OF THE OLYMPICS IN HER HOMETOWN OR ATTENDING THE WEDDING OF HER  ELDEST GRANDSON OR BEHOLDING A  MASSIVE FLOTILLA JUST TO CELEBRATE HER. WHATEVER THE OCCASION, SHE HAS A  FACE WHICH DEMONSTRABLY SAYS I  DON'T GIVE A ROYAL [BLEEP]. WHICH BRINGS US TO A MUCH LARGER  QUESTION HERE. WHY DO WE... WHY HAS COVERAGE OF  THE ROYAL BABY BEEN LIKE A NEW  SCREEN SAVER FOR THE WHOLE LAST  WEEK? CNN WAS JUST BOTHERING BRITISH  LADIES.
I'M HERE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM  WITH A WOMAN ABOUT TO HAVE A  BABY. SHE'S TAKING LAUGHING GAS FOR  PAIN.
IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU LAUGH. NOTHING IS FUNNY RIGHT NOW. , NOTHING IS FUNNY. John: REALLY? NOTHING IS FUNNY. NOT EVEN A SPECTACLE OF A NEWS  ORGANIZATION SHOVING MICROPHONES  IN THE FACE OF WOMEN IN LABOR? ONLY TODAY CNN AND MS-NBC  LITERALLY AIRED THE CANNON  SALUTE IN ITS ENTIRE TEE. NOW, THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT  ACTUALLY MEANS. FOR THREE SOLID MINUTES OF THIS.
FIRE! FNG.
John: I THINK IT WAS AROUND  THE TIME OF THE 48th CANNON  BLAST THAT YOU REALIZED, OH, NOW I GET IT. THE ROYAL BIRTH. WE'LL BE RIGHT
