FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEAD QUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. I'M HAPPY THAT YOU HAVE JOINED US.  I'M HAPPY YOU'VE JOINED US THIS EVENING. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A YOUNG FELLOW NAMED BEN AFFLECK. HE'S GOING TO BE JOINING US A LITTLE LATER. HE'S GOT THIS FILM OUT CALLED "GONE GIRL." PEOPLE LIKE HIM. (CHEERING) VERY TALENTED. YOU KNOW, BUT FIRST, OBVIOUSLY YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE STUDIO, APPARENTLY, EBOLA IS IN AMERICA. GUESS WE'LL GET TO THAT TOMORROW. (LAUGHTER) DONE AND DONE. BUT FIRST, AS AMERICA CONFRONTS THE SEEMINGLY UNSTOPPABLE DUAL THREATS OF ISIS AND REALLY FAST WHITE HOUSE LAWN-RUNNERS, WE FIND OURSELVES SELECTING A NEW CROP OF MIDTERM LEGISLATORS. LET'S GO TO IOWA! WHERE SUNDAY'S SENATE DEBATE SAW DEMOCRAT BRUCE BRALEY AND REPUBLICAN JONI ERNST PRESENT A REAL CHOICE.
SENATOR ERNST WOULD HAVE VOTED TO SHUT DOWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH TED CRUZ, SHE'S CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA A DICTATOR AND THINKS IMPEACHMENT SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE.
OKAY, THAT'S, BRALEY, BRALEY JUMPS IN PAINTING ERNST AS AN EXTREMIST, A REACTIONARY. HOW DOES ERNST RESPOND? PERHAPS A MOVE TO THE CENTER.
YOU THREATENED TO SUE A NEIGHBOR OVER CHICKENS THAT CAME ONTO YOUR PROPERTY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TOUCHE. BRALEY JUMPS IN, YOU'RE AN ULTRA-PARTISAN IDEOLOGUE. ERNST ANSWERS, YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING CHICKEN (BLEEP) ON YOUR LAWN! AND STAY DOWN! SO ERNST HAS THE "TRESPASSING CHICKEN" VOTE SEWN UP. SO THE WINNER WILL BE DECIDED BY AN OLD-FASHIONED HAWK-EYE STATE FOLKSY-OFF.
I GREW UP IN A WORKING-CLASS HOME IN A SMALL FARM TOWN.
I GREW UP DRINKING WELL WATER ON A SOUTHWEST IOWA FARM.
MY DAD RAN A GRAIN ELEVATOR.
MY FATHER IS A FARMER, A VERY PROUD FARMER.
I GOT MY FIRST JOB IN THIRD GRADE.
I WAS THE MORNING BISCUIT-MAKER AT HARDEES IN RED OAK.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. LET ME JUST TALLY THIS UP. WE'VE GOT EIGHT POINTS FOR WELL WATER DYSENTERY. WE'VE GOT FOUR POINTS, GRAIN ELEVATOR BLINDNESS. WE'VE GOT TEN POINTS FOR CHILD LABOR... CARRY THE BISCUIT-MAKING.... OH, MY GOD, IT'S A TIE! THEY HAVE BOTH ACHIEVED, THIS IS EXCITING, A "WILFORD BRIMLEY OATMEAL" LEVEL OF FOLKSINESS! THIS NEVER HAPPENS.  ALMOST HAPPENS. BRILLIANTLY DONE PEOPLE. ONE OF YOU WILL TAKE THAT DOWN-HOME, JUST-FOLKS, REAL-AMERICAN-NESS TO WASHINGTON TO WRITE THE KIND OF COMMON-SENSE, AW-SHUCKS LAWS THAT SOMEHOW PROTECT THIS NATION FROM TRESSPASSING CHICKENS OR WHATEVER. OR YOU WOULD DO THAT, IF MAKING LAWS WAS STILL WHAT CONGRESS DID. ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN. ALL AMERICANS KNOW HOW A BILL BECOME A LAW.
♪ I'M JUST A BILL  ♪ YES, I'M ONLY A BILL  ♪ AND I'M SITTING HERE ON CAPITOL HILL ♪♪
Jon: RECENTLY THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, THOUGH, HAS GROWN MORE COMPLICATED. TAKE THE 2010 DODD FRANK ACT. IN THE WAKE OF THE 2008 CATASTROPHIC BANK COLLAPSE THAT DESTROYED THE WORLD'S ECONOMY, IT WAS MEANT TO URGENTLY REFORM A CRIPPLED AND FAILING FINANCIAL SYSTEM. BUT AFTER SIXTEEN MONTHS OF HEARINGS, LOBBYING AND HORSE TRADING CONGRESS FINALLY PRODUCED AN 848-PAGE WATERED DOWN TOOTHLESS PIECE OF (BLEEP) THAT LEAVES OUR ECONOMY ALMOST AS VULNERABLE AS IT WAS PRE-CRISIS OR AS CONGRESS NOW CALLS THAT, THEIR FINEST HOUR.
THE CURRENT CONGRESS IS BAD AT PASSING LEGISLATION.
THEIR RECORD IS JUST DISMAL.
IT'S ON TRACK TO BE THE LEAST PRODUCTIVE IN HISTORY.
Jon: IN OTHER WORDS, CONGRESS HAS NOW GREATLY SIMPLIFIED THE PROCESS FOR PASSING LAWS, IN THAT IT DOES NOT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS USELESS WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, HOW A BILL BECOMES AN AD. HERE'S HOW THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS NOW.
WE HAVE A WHOLE AGENDA NOW CALLED THE FAIR SHOT AGENDA -- EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN, EQUAL WORK.
RIGHT.
MINIMUM WAGE, HELPING PAY FOR COLLEGE.
Jon: NOBLE GOALS! BUT DEMOCRATS LIKE CHUCK SCHUMER ARE OR COURSE AWARE THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THOSE TO BE PASSED! WHY DO AT A CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEM?
NOW, WE DEMOCRATS WOULD PREFER THESE ITEMS PASS AND BECOME LAW. BUT IF REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THESE ISSUES, THEY'LL DO SO AT THEIR OWN POLITICAL RISK. THAT'S THE DISTINCTION WE WILL DRAW IN NOVEMBER.
Jon: FOR ONCE A YEAR -- -- IT IS WRITTEN THAT IN OUR 11th MONTH, WE GATHER AS A CONGREGATION TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN, AS MAIMONIDES PUT IT, FECKLESSNESS AND OBSTRUCTIONISM. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING -- THAT -- (LAUGHTER) LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING -- NO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (BLEEP) KILLED AT MY BAR MITZVAH. KILLED! SCHUMER JUST LAUNCHED THE FAIR SHOT AGENDA LIKE A CLAY PIGEON FOR REPUBLICANS TO SHOOT DOWN, SO THAT DEMOCRATS COULD THEN RUN MIDTERM CAMPAIGN ADS LIKE THESE.
HEY, MITCH, WHY DO YOU REFUSE TO GIVE STUDENTS THE SAME LOAN RATES AS THOSE BIG BANKS
WHILE VOTING 17 TIMES AGAINST RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.
WILL YOU FINALLY GIVE WOMEN EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH... HATERS, GONNA HATE, HATE -- WELL, I'M JUST GONNA SHAKE IT OFF... A'YUP. GOOD WORK, SENATE DEMOCRATS! YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO TURN PERPETUAL GRIDLOCK INTO PERPETUAL GRIDLOCK-ADE. OF COURSE, REPUBLICANS DO THE SAME THING IN THE CHAMBER THEY CONTROL. YOU EVER WONDER WHY THE HOUSE WASTED EVERYONE'S TIME ON 54 FAILED VOTES TO REPEAL ALL OR PART OF OBAMACARE? HERE'S WHY.
BARBER HAS FALLEN IN LINE WITH OBAMA AND PELOSI, EVEN VOTING TO DEFEND OBAMACARE.
CONGRESSMAN AMI BERA VOTED TO KEEP IT.
SCHNEIDER VOTED TO KEEP OBAMACARE.
BARROW VOTED TO KEEP OBAMACARE NOT ONCE BUT THREE TIMES!
OF COURSE, HE WANTS OBAMACARE! LOOK AT HIS FREAKISHLY DISFIGURED BODY! CREEPY GIANT HEAD AND HIS FREAKISH FINGERS! BEFORE OBAMACARE THAT'D BE A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY SAYING TO YOURSELF, I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW CHILDISH AND CYNICAL OUR CONGRESS HAS BECOME. WELL DON'T THROW UP YET.
SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE HELPING DEMOCRATS MOVE LEGISLATION ON EQUAL PAY AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.
Jon: WHAT! OH, MY GOSH, I WOULD SAY HOORAY FOR THAT IF I DIDN'T KNOW IN MY HEART THAT THERE MUST BE SOME CRAVEN RUSE THAT WOULD BONERIZE MACHIAVELLI AT PLAY HERE.
AWAY FROM THE MICROPHONE SENATE REPUBLICANS ACKNOWLEDGE THEY ARE CHEWING UP TIME ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO AVOID TOUGH VOTES. BY EXTENDING DEBATE ON THESE TWO ISSUES THEY ARE OCCUPYING THE REMAINING FEW DAYS ON THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR. AND THAT'S PREVENTING DEMOCRATS LED BY SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID TO SCHEDULE A POLITICALLY VOLATILE VOTES BEFORE THE FALL RECESS.
Jon: WELL COME TO YOUR NEW CONGRESS, PEOPLE. YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING? SO THEY SAY, I SEE YOUR ATTACK AD BAIT AND I RAISE YOU TIME-KILLING, FALSE COOPERATION. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE ON A BAD DATE. DEMOCRATS KNOW THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO BE THERE, AND REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO BE THERE. (LAUGHTER) SO IN THEIR CYNICISM, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ASKED -- WANNA SEE THE DESSERT MENU? AND OUT OF SPITE, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID, BRING OVER THE WHOLE (BLEEP) CART. (LAUGHTER) AND THE ESPRESSO MACHINE, BECAUSE I CAN DO THIS ALL NIGHT LONG! YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SEX, BUT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET TO (BLEEP) ANYBODY ELSE EITHER. SO PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO UPDATE THE CLASSIC HOW A BILL BECOMES A LAW. ♪ I'M JUST A BILL  ♪ AND IT'S MAKING ME ILL  ♪ NOW I WON'T EVEN BE A CAMPAIGN ♪  SO I'M JUST HOLDING MY DICK ♪  AS I SIT HERE AND WAIT ♪ ♪ WHILE THE BAD MOTHER (BLEEP) HOLD A PHONY DEBATE ♪ ♪ I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE  ♪ I'M DONE  ♪ I'LL BUY A GUN  ♪ AND MY BRAINS I WILL SPILL ON STEPS OF THE CAPITOL HILL ♪♪
Jon: OH MY GOD, SOMEBODY GET A BROOM! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
