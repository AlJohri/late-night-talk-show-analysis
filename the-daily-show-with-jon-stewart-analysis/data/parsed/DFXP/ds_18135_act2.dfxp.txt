WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN AGAIN  WITH NOBODY'S FAVORITE NEW YORK  CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATE, ANTHONY WEINER, WHO CONTINUES TO REFUSE  TO DO ANYTHING RESEMBLING THE  RIGHT THING.
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE  NEWSPAPER EDITORS AND OTHER  POLITICIANS THAT SAY, BOY, I WISH THAT GUY WEINER WOULD QUIT. THEY DON'T KNOW NEW YORK. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ME. QUIT ISN'T THE WAY WE ROLL  THROUGH NEW YORK CITY. WE FIGHT THROUGH TOUGH THINGS. WE ARE A TOUGH CITY.
John: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ARE YOU NOT DOING THIS. YOU ARE NOT 9/11'ING YOUR DICK  PICKS. NO! THIS IS A LINE AND YOU JUST WENT  OVER THAT LINE. IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST STOP  TALKING ALTOGETHER AND HIRE A  PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR TO SPEAK FOR YOU.
YESTERDAY, WEINER'S  COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, BARBARA  MORGAN, CALLED A FORMER INTERN A "BLEEPING SHUT BAG" AND OTHER  CHOICE WORDS DISPLAWN THAT'S  WEINER'S COMMUNICATIONS  DIRECTOR. AND WHILE SHE AT LEAST  COMMUNICATES WITH WORDS RATHER  THAN WITH HER GENITALS, IT'S STILL NOT IDEAL. NOWRNTION, NORMALLY, THAT KIND  OF THING WOULD COST YOU YOUR  JOB, BUT WHAT IS ANTHONY WEINER GOING TO DO, FIRE HER FOR  INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR? HE CAN'T DO THAT, AND THAT IS  WHY HE WONT BE ABLE TO RUN THIS  CITY. HE HAS NO STANDING TO PUNISH  ANYONE FOR ANYTHING ANYMORE. THOUSAND OF PEOPLE COULD BE  URINATING ON POLICE CARS AND  SAY, "I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT URINATING, MR. MAYOR, BECAUSE AS  YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT HOW WE ROLL  HERE IN NEW YORK CITY." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LET'S LET THE VOTERS DECIDE. NOW, WE'VE BEEN COVER AGO  ( LAUGHTER )  WE'VE BEEN COVERING THIS STORY A  LOT BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE IN NEW YORK, BUT PLEASE, PLEASE KNOW  IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T CARE  ABOUT OTHER CITIES' ELECTED PERVERTS, TOO.
IS IT THE MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO  ACCUSED OF BEHAVIOR SO  INAPPROPRIATE IT MIGHT MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL?
NOW, HE'LL PROBABLY-- YOU'RE  PROBABLY THINKING THAT'S QUITE A  CLAIM. POST-WEINER IT'S GOING TO TAKE A  THROT MAKE MY SKIN CRAWL. WELL, GET READY TO POLICY FOR  YOUR SKIP FOR WHAT IT'S ABOUT TO  HEAR. IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO CURL. IT'S GOING TO SPIDER WALK ACROSS  THE CEILING LIKE LINDA BLAIR IN  THE "EXORCIST.
AN EIGHTH WOMAN HAS COME  FORWARD TO ACCUSE SAN DIEGO'S  MAYOR WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMING HE KISSED HER AFTER A  BUSINESS MEETING.
ON THE SIDEWALK, THE MAYOR,  SUDDENLY, IN CLEAR VIEW OF  ANYONE WHO MIGHT PASS BY, GRABBED AND KISSED HER, JAMMING  HIS TONGUE DOWN HER THROAT.
John: EWWWW! THAT IS GROSS AND SEXUAL  ASSAULT. BUT IT GETS A LOT WORSE, SO MUCH  SO, IN FACT, LET'S PUT UP THE  "EWWWWWHELP OMTER."
HE SAID I SHOULD BE  APPRECIATE FORWARD WORKING MY  BEHIND OFF. HE TOLD ME TO TURN AND AROUND HE  PATTED ME ON THE VEER AND  LAUGHED AND SAID, NO, IT'S STILL  THERE.
John: EWWWW! LOOK AT THE NEEDLE. LOOK AT THE NEEDLE! IT'S REACHING 4.2. THAT IS DISGUSTING, AND, AGAIN,  SEXUAL ASSAULT. BUT, PLEASE, TELL ME IT DOESN'T  GET WORSE THAN THAT.
THE MAYOR QUICKLY HAD HIS  HAND ON THE INSIDE OF HER BRA.
AND I TURNED AND-- AND HE  JUST SLOBBERED DOWN MY CHIN.
John: EWWW! EWWW! EWWW! EWWWW! SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT ANTHONY  WEINER, AT LEAST HIS PICS DON'T  LEAVE A PHYSICAL RESIDUE ON YOUR  FACE.
THE MAYOR CHALLENGED ME TO  GIVE HIM ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW HIS  BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ME WAS  IMPROPER. I POINT OUT THAT HE HAD ASKED ME  TO WORK WITHOUT MY UNDERWEAR ON.
John: EWWW! I'VE GOT-- OH! OH! OH! HE BROKE THE EWWW-OMTER. THAT'S THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE  AGAINST HIM. DOES HE HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY IN  HIS DEFENSE?
I'M A VERY DEMONSTRATIVE  PERSON. I-- I EXPRESS MYSELF  DEMONSTRABLY. I'M A-- I'M A HUGGER.
John: NEVER SMILE AGAIN! NEVER SMILE EVER AGAIN! IS IT POSSIBLE, THROUGH A SINGLE  IMAGE, TO SMELL SOMEONE'S TEETH. THIS MAN IS REVOLTING. HE SHOULD-- HE SHOULD PROBABLY  BE ARRESTED. HE IS AT THE VERY LEAST UNFIT  FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. PLEASE TELL ME THAT UNLIKE  ANTHONY WEINER FILLENER KNOWS  WHEN TO QUIT.
BEGINNING ON AUGUST 5, I WILL  BE ENTERING A BEHAVIOR  COUNSELING CLINIC TO UNDERGO TWO WEEKS OF INTENSIVE THERAPY TO  BEGIN THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING  MY BEHAVIOR. SO WHEN I RETURN ON AUGUST 19--
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,  WHOA, WHOA! WAIT, WAIT! YOU'RE COMING BACK! AFTER TWO WEEKS? YOUR FITNESS FOR OFFICE PROBLEM  IS NOT THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE  FIVE POUNDS. IT'S THAT YOU NEED TO LOSE YOUR  ENTIRE PERSONALITY. ( LAUGHTER ). AND BY THE WAY, NOT EVERY  NAUSEATING THING FILLENER DOES  IS SEXUAL.
HE SHOCKED HIS CONSTITUENTS  WITH THIS, ASKING SAN DIEGO  TAXPAYERS TO COVER HIS LEGAL FEES FOR A SEXUAL HARASSMENT  LAWSUIT.
OOOOH!
John: COVER HIS LEGAL FEES. DON'T WORRY. THERE IS NO WAY THE PEOPLE OF  SAND YIEG ARE GOING TO GRANT HIM  THAT REQUEST. IN FACT, I THINK HE'S BETTER  NGTO RAISE THE MONEY ONOFF TRYI
