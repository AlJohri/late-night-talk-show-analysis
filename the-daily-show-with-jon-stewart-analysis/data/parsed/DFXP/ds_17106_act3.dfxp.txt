YES.
Jon: OR MORE FRUSTRATESING.
I FIND VERY ENERGIZING. I ALWAYS SAID IT IS NEVER FUN TO BE UNEMPLOYED ANYWHERE BECAUSE IT SUCKS FINANCIALLY BUT I ALWAYS  FOUND IT MUCH EASIER TO BE UNEMPLOYED HERE THAN LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE. AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT ISOLATING HERE. IT IS THE SAME OLD TALE BUT IT IS LIKE IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, THERE IS LIKE A  PACK OF GUM YOU HAVE TO RUN INTO 20 PEOPLE ON THE WAY TO GET IT HERE. AND IN L.A., YOU KNOW, YOU JUST WON'T GO GET THE GUM BECAUSE I WON'T WANT TO  FIGHT FOR PARKING, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU JUST STAY HOME WITH BAD BREATH.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT FOR PARKING AND THEN EXPLAIN TO THE CLERK AT 7-11  WHAT YOU ARE WORKING ON.
THAT'S TRUE. EVERYTHING IS VERY INDUSTRY DRIVEN OUT THERE I LOVE IT THERE, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT.
Jon: I USED TO LOVE, WHEN I STARTED I WAS WAITING TABLES UP IN ROCKEFELLER  CENTER, A LITTLE RESTAURANT THERE BECAUSE I THINK BEAN STALK, I USED TO HAVE TO  WEAR THOSE FRILLY LIKE FAKE TUX SHIRTS WITH THE SUSPENDERS.
I BET YOU LOOKED PRETTY.
Jon: NO, SIR. PRETTY UNTIL I WAS COVERED IN QUACK MOLLY AND SALSA BUT I USED TO LOVE RIDING THE  SUBWAY HOME AT NIGHT IN YOUR LITTLE RED BOW TIE AND ALL THE THUGS ON ITS SUBWAY ARE  LIKE OH THAT POOR GUY.
WELL, THAT IS IT, THOUGH. I OFTEN SAID WHEN I'M IN NEW YORK, I FEEL LIKE I'M ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS. YOU RUN INTO SO MANY PEOPLE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MAJOR IS OR WHAT YOU ARE DOING, BUT I SEE YOU ON THE L TRAIN AND I SEE YOU ON THE 1, AND YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF ALL IN  THIS ONE MILE CAMPUS TOGETHER. AND I LEAK IT.
Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID IT ENERGIZES, BECAUSE THESE SHOWS, 8 A WEEK.
8 A WEEK.
Jon: .
IT'S HEAVEN T REALLY IS AND I THINK WOULD YOU LIKE IT I REALLY DO.
Jon: I THINK WOULD YOU LIKE IT TOO. JIM PARSONS WHO IS GREAT, AND AN INVISIBLE 6 FOOT 3 AND A HALF INCH BUNNY.
AND HE'S GREAT, THE RABBIT IS THE BEST THING GOING ON BROADWAY.
