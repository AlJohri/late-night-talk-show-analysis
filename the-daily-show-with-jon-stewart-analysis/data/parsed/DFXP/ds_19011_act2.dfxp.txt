Jon: WELCOME BACK. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE SUPREME COURT EFFECTIVELY STRUCK DOWN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT SAYING IT HAD BEEN IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL AT REDRESSING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION SO BASICALLY SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I MEAN, WHY RUIN A GOOD THING BY CONTINUING IT? [LAUGHTER] ASSIF MANDVI REPORTS.
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 PROTECTED VOTERS FROM RACIAL DISCRIMINATION UNTIL JUNE WHEN THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN A KEY PROVISION SAYING IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY WHICH RED STATES CELEBRATED BY INTRODUCING CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIVE VOTING LAWS.
THESE LAWS ARE JUST AS RACIST AS THEY CAN BE.
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS APPARENTLY DOESN'T LIKE PROGRESS.
IN ANOTHER TIME AND ANOTHER PERIOD, THESE DEVICES WAS USED TO MAKE IT HARDER, MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON DOF COLOR TO PARTICIPATE IN THEN PROCESS.
I DON'T THINK ANY PART OF LAW IS RACIST.
NORTH CAROLINA PRECINCT CHAIRMAN AND GOP COMMITTEE MEMBER DON YELTIN THINKS HIS STATE'S VOTING RESTRICTIONS ARE JUST FINE.
THE PROCESS WILL HAVE MORE INTEGRITY. RIGHT HERE IN BUNKHAM COUNTY THERE'S ONE OR TWO THAT VOTED TWICE A YEAR.
ONE OR TWO MILLION PEOPLE?
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE.
ONE OR TWO OUT OF HOW MANY?
THAT'S JUST ONE OR TWO OUT OF 60,000.
SO  STATISTICALLY THERE'S ENOUGH VOTER FRAUD TO SWAY ZERO ELECTIONS.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE POINT IS VOTER FRAUD DOES JUST BARELY EXIST WHILE RACISM, ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT IS A THING OF THE PAST.
THE SCARS AND STAINS OF RACISM ARE STILL DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN EVERY CORNER OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.
BUT YOU ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT RACISM, RACISM, RACISM AS IF IT'S THE 1960'S. IT'S NOT THE 1960'S ANYMORE. I THINK THE MEN IN THIS PICTURE WOULD BE ASHAMED YOU ARE THROWING AROUND THE WORD RACISM SO CAVALIERLY.
I AM IN THAT PICTURE.
WHAT?
I'M THERE.
SEE, THIS IS WHY YOU PEOPLE NEED I.D.'S BECAUSE WE CAN'T TELL YOU APART. I MEAN, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS.
WE ALL DON'T LOOK ALIKE.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ALL HAVE? THE SAME AURA OF HOPE.
WE NEVER GAVE UP OR BECAME BITTER. IS THAT DENZEL WASHINGTON?
NO THERE WAS THE HEAD OF NAACP.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE LAW IS NOT RACIST.
OF COURSE THE LAW IS NOT RACIST AND YOU ARE NOT RACIST.
WELL, I'VE BEEN CALLED A BIGOT BEFORE. YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ME BUT I'VE TREATED YOU LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IS BLACK.
ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS IS BLACK?
YES.
AND THERE'S MORE.
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN, YOU DIDN'T CALL A BLACK A BLACK. YOU CALLED HIM A NEGRO. I HAD A PICTURE OF OBAMA SITTING ON A STUMP AS A WITCH DR. FOR YOUR INFORMATION I WAS MAKING FUN OF MY WHITE HALF OF OBAMA, NOT THE BLACK HALF. AND NOW YOU HAVE A BLACK PERSON USING THE TERM [BLEEP] THIS, [BLEEP] THAT. ANT IT'S OKAY FOR THEM TO DO IT.
YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU, RIGHT?
YES.
YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN HEAR YOU?
YES.
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEN I FOUND OUT FOR THE REAL REASON FOR THE LAW.
THE LAW IS GOING TO KICK DEMOCRATS IN THE BUTT.
WOW AN EXECUTIVE G.O.P. COMMITTEE MEMBER ADMITTED THAT THIS LAW ISN'T DESIGNED TO HURT BLACK PEOPLE, IT'S DESIGNED TO HURT DEMOCRATS.
IF IT HURTS A BUNCH OF COLLEGE KIDS TOO LAZY TO GET UP OFF HER BOHUNKUS AND GET A PHOTO I.D., SO BE IT.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
IF IT HURTS THE WHITES SO BE IT. IF IT HURTS A BUNCH OF LAZY BLACKS THAT WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, SO BE IT.
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE VOTE DEMOCRAT.
GEE! THAT'S RIGHT TO SUPPOSEDLY PREVENT ONE OR TWO CASES OF FRAUD THIS LAW COULD SUPPRESS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACTUAL VOTERS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT MANY STUPID PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS THAT GO DOWN THERE AND GET A PHOTO I.D. FOR FREE AT THE DMV. DO YOU WANT THOSE PEOPLE PICKING YOUR PRESIDENT?
NO, WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT STUPID PEOPLE PICKING OUR PRESIDENT OR DEMOCRATS APPARENTLY. RACISM IS OVER, YES.
IT'S NOT THERE YET.
OH, OKAY.
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.
SO THE PLAYING FIELD SHOULD BE LEVEL?
MUST BE LEVEL. THE PLAYING FIELD MUST BE LEVEL.
SINCE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO SUPPRESS DEMOCRATIC VOTES PERHAPS THE ONLY FAIR WAY TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IS TO TRY TO SUPPRESS REPUBLICAN VOTES. DO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS COME IN HERE?
NO.
WHEEL IT IN. MOVE VOTING BOOTHS TO BLACK HAIR SALONS AND HERE. ADD MANDATORY FRIEND REQUIREMENTS. TELL REPUBLICANS TO DO WHAT JESUS WOULD DO AND REMEMBER MOST IMPORTANTLY --
VOTE, VOTE.
BECAUSE I VOTED AND NOW I'M GAY.
THAT'S RIGHT REPUBLICANS, VOTING MAKES YOU GAY. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ASSIF MANDVI.
