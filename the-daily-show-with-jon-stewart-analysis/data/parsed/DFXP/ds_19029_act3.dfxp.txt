THAT BEARD AND MUSTACHE, AND EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER KNOWS IN THE HOBBIT THEY WEAR A WIG.
Jon: IS THAT THE CASE?

Jon: IT IS AN ALL -- WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?  THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DISCOVER MORE TOLKIEN WHEN THIS IS OVER OR NEW ZEALAND WILL IMPLODE.
THERE IS PLENTY MORE AS STEPHEN COLBERT WILL TELL YOU, THERE IS MORE.
Jon: DID THEY TAKE FROM THAT BECAUSE THE HOBBIT, TO GET THREE MOVIES FROM THE HOBBIT DO THEY BORROW MATERIAL FROM OTHER PLACES?
THEY DO A BIT BUT THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS THE ADVANTAGE OF LITERATURE OVER FILM. TOLL CAN I ENWRITES.
TOLKIEN WRITES TENS OF THOUSANDS ARRIVE GONE PLAIN.
THAT ISN'T ENOUGH, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE 10,000 ARRIVING, IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR 10,000 ARRIVING.
Jon: YOU CAN MEET EACH GUY.
IT CAN GO ON AND ON, IT IS BASICALLY THE SAME STORY BUT A BIT MORE OF GANDALF AND WHAT HE IS UP TO. HE IS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH --
Jon: OH!  REALLY?
NO, NO.
Jon: OH!  I THOUGHT WOW, THEY ARE TAKING LINTS HERE. DID YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER DID YOU KNOW HELEN MIRREN WHEN YOU WERE STARTING OUT WITH HER?
I KNEW OF HER.
Jon: YOU NEVER MET HER?
SHE WAS NOT QUITE TO MY TASTE, I'M AFRAID.
Jon: NO, NO, NO. I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AS A KNOW HER IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE M THE BIBLICAL SENSE.
Jon: SO I.
SO I HAD THIS ACTRESS ON JENNIFER LAWRENCE, TERRIFIC ACTRESS.
YES. WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO HELP HER.
Jon: SO I POINT OUT, VERY, I THINK, SHREWDLY, AND WITH GREAT ANALYSIS SHE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG HELEN MIRREN. DO WE HAVE A PICTURE. PUT IT UP THERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
NOT PARTICULARLY.

I KNOW JENNIFER LAWRENCE, I HAVE WORKED WITH HER.
Jon: SHE IS LOVELY.
SHE AND THE "X-MEN".
Jon: EXACTLY. SHE PLAYED MYSTIQUE.
YES.
Jon: SEE NOW.
SHE IS THE BLUE ONE.
Jon: NOW YOU KNOW THAT WAS MY JAM. NOW HOW ABOUT FOR YOU WHEN YOU WERE SORT OF A YOUNG GUY, DID YOU READ THE COMIC BOOKS?  WERE YOU INTERESTED THIS THAT SORT OF THING IS WAS IT A LITERATURE THING?
WELL, THEY WERE AMERICAN, AND DURING THE WAR, WE DIDN'T GET MUCH OF ANYTHING FROM ANYWHERE SO THE LOCAL COMICS WERE VERY PALTRY AND NOTHING LIKE THE COMICS THAT YOU HAVE, SO NO, I DIDN'T READ THEM.
Jon: DURING THE -- DO YOU RECALL THE ISOLATION OF THAT?  WHAT WAS THAT FEELING LIKE?  I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE THERE DURING THAT TIME.
WELL, I WAS BORN IN 1939 AND I LIVED IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND, WE WERE SAFE FROM BOMBS AND WE HAD EVACUEES WHO CAME FROM LONDON TO LIVE WITH US, AND WE HAD FAMILIES TO ESCAPE THE BLITZ. BUT I SLEPT UNDER A METAL TABLE UNTIL I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD, IN CASE THERE WAS A BOMB IN THE HOUSE. WE PUT TAPE OVER THE WINDOWS SO THE GERMANS COULDN'T SEE WHERE WE LIVED, IT WAS A FACTOR OF LIFE.
Jon: OF DOING THAT?
YES.
Jon: I SLEPT ON A METAL, UNDER A METAL TABLE TOO BECAUSE MY PARENTS DIDN'T LIKE ME.
BUT NOW YOU HAVE GOT THE TV PROGRAM.
Jon: YOU ARE THE MOST EMPATHETIC MAN. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT THE TIME. I EVEN TOLD THEM -- WERE THEY OKAY WITH YOU BECOMING AN ACTOR?
WELL, MY MOTHER WAS -- BY THE TIME I BECAME AN ACTOR SHE HAD SAID AND IT IS A CONSTANT COMFORT TO ME, MY AUNT, IF HE DECIDES TO BECOME AN ACTOR, I WAS 11 AT THE TIME, HE WOULD BRING A LOT OF TREASURE TO PEOPLE.

Jon: WHAT A LOVELY SENTIMENT.
SO I LIVED MY LIFE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO ENJOY THEMSELVES.
Jon: ISN'T IT INTERESTING SHE SAID SUCH AN ODD THING OF THATER HE ARE A --
SHE LOVED TO GO TO THE THEATRE AND SHE HAD A LOT OF PLEASURE IN THE AUDIENCE AND SHE DOCK ME TO THE THEATRE SO I THOUGHT BEING AN ACTOR WAS A GOOD THING.
Jon: I ALWAYS WONDERED IN TIMES OF REAL STRIFE AND TROUBLE THAT THEATRE PROVIDES SUCH RELIEF, YOU KNOW, YOU IN ENGLAND AND IN THAT TIME, EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING, THE THEATRE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL ESCAPE FOR PEOPLE. THAT MAGIC.
HELEN AND, HELEN MIRREN AND I WERE DOING A PLAY IN 2001, THE DANCE OF DEATH, IT IS BY STENBERG, A LOT OF POPULAR SHOWS IN THE MAINSTREAM AUDIENCE, YOU COULDN'T GET ON AND OFF THE ISLAND, ALL OF THE LONG RUNNING SHOWS, THE PRODUCERS HAD RUN OUT OF AUDIENCE BECAUSE THE OUT OF TOWNERS WEREN'T GETTING TICKETS. AND WE WERE THE LATEST SHOW IN TOWN AND YOU COULDN'T GET TICKETS THAT NEW YORKERS ABSOLUTELY HAD TO GO TO THE THEATRE. YOU HAD A SENSE THERE WAS A FUTURE, THERE WAS A LIFE.
