Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW TOMORROW NIGHT, TOMORROW NIGHT PRESIDENT WILL ADDRESS THE STATE OF OUR UNION. LET'S GET A JUMP ON WITH IT WITH OUR OWN CHECK ON SOME OF SOCIETY'S INSTITUTIONS IN OUR NEW SEGMENT WHERE ARE WE NOW? MAYBE THE PRESIDENT HAS TIME TO COVER THE WHOLE UNION, BUT I HAVE A HALF HOUR, AND A THIRD OF THAT IS TAKEN UP WITH JEFF GARLIN. STAY TUNED TONIGHT FOR JEFF GARLIN FROM THE HIT SHOW "THE GOLDBERGS." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW I'VE SEEN HIM IN OTHER THINGS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S ONLY "THE GOLDBERGS." THE NEWS MEDIA IS LOOKING STRONG. LAST WEEK, FOR INSTANCE, MSNBC RAN A SURPRISINGLY SUBSTANTIVE DEBATE ABOUT GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE. WANTS RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER NOT --
LET ME INTERRUPT YOU. CONGRESSWOMAN LET ME INTERRUPT YOU FOR A MOMENT. WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF MIAMI.
Jon: BREAKING NEWS THAT IS MORE URGENT THAN THE GOVERNMENT SPYING ON AMERICANS AND FROM MIAMI? DID MIAMI'S SOUND MACHINE SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST KILLING MILLIONS? IT WOULD BE THE GREATEST TRAGEDY SINCE THE GREAT C AND C MUSIC FACTORY FIRE OF 1911. TELL ME IT'S NOT THAT.
STAND BY IF YOU WILL, IN MIAMI JUSTIN BIEBER HAS BEEN ARRESTED ON A NUMBER OF CHARGES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Jon: THEY ARE NOT BOOING THEY ARE SAYING BOO-BER. YOU INTERRUPTED A FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN AND NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERT FOR SOMETHING JUSTIN BIEBER DID? UNLESS HE CAUSED AN EARTHQUAKE IN JAPAN I DOUBT IT WAS WORTH IT. STILL THE MEDIA FLOODED THE ZONE FOR BIEBER'S DRAG RACING ARREST WITH CNN IN PARTICULAR PULLING OUT THE STOPS WITH A SPECIAL REPORT WITH FOOTAGE LIFTED FROM TMZ TESTIMONY FROM THREE FORMER CHILD STARS AND STATE OF THE ART CGI SIMULATION.
WHEN HE RACED AGAINST A FERRARI ON A QUIET STRETCH OF BEACH BOTH VEHICLES NEARLY TWICE THE SPEED LIMIT. TWO BLACK S.U.V.S BLOCKING THE ROADWAY.
Jon: AND THEN YOSHI HIT A KOOPA SHELL AND PAC MAN AND WHO SHOWS UP, JUST IN TIME TO BEAT UP HOOKERS OH, THE HUMANITY. [ LAUGHTER ] POINT IS. WHAT A TERRIBLE IDEA OF COVERAGE. WHAT ABOUT OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE. SENATOR TED CRUZ OF TEXAS. POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, LEADING LIGHT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. A FEW MONTHS AGO HE PUSHED THE G.O.P. TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT ANY REGRETS?
I SAID WE SHOULDN'T SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN.
IF YOU DIDN'T THREATEN TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT WHO DID?
HARRY REID AND PRESIDENT OBAMA.
Jon: I DON'T REMEMBER IT THAT WAY. THERE IS JUST ONE THING ABOUT THAT.
SENATOR JOHN CORNYN SAID IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO PARTIALLY SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SECURE THE LONG-TERM FISCAL WELL BEING OF THE COUNTRY.
WE SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN.
WE WILL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT IF WE HAVE.
Tom: THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO SHUT DOWN.
I SAY SHUT IT DOWN.
Jon: LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OURSELVES ONE OF THOSE HE SAID, ACTUAL VIDEOTAPE RECORDINGS OF THE EVENTS AT THE TIME SAID DISAGREEMENTS. I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH. YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT TED CRUZ'S REIMAGINING IN CRUZ YOUR OWN ADVENTURE FROM THE NORTHERN STATES' SECESSION FROM THE CONFEDERACY TO MOON MAN NEIL ARMSTRONG'S HISTORIC LANDING ON EARTH. IF TED CRUZ REMEMBERS IT THAT WAY, THEN IT'S TRUE. SO THAT'S WHERE OUR REPRESENTATIVES ARE AT WHAT ABOUT THE CIVIL SERVANTS  DOING THE REAL WORK OF GOVERNMENT AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE GEORGE TSUNIS THE NOMINEE FOR THE AMBASSADOR TO NORWAY. HE IS A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR AMBASSADOR.
Jon: GOOD FOR HIM. I SURE PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HIM WHEN HE MAJORED IN NORWEGIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MINORED IN FJORDS. WHO IS LAUGHING NOW?
HAVE YOU BEEN TO NORWAY?
NO.
Jon: BEEN TO NORWAY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME THAT PLACE IS A FROZEN (bleep). I WOULDN'T (bleep) WITH SWEDEN (bleep) YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SO DID I GET THE JOB OR WHAT? COME ON. WHY ON EARTH DID PRESIDENT OBAMA NOMINATE A GUY WHO HAS NEVER BEEN TO NORWAY TO BE THE AMBASSADOR OF NORWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE.
HE RAISED NEARLY $850,000 FOR THE PRESIDENT'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN.
Jon: CAN WE PULL UP THE LIVE FEED FROM NORWAY RIGHT ABOUT NOW? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY BAD FOR EVERYTHING BUT LET'S NOT FORGET, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION WE HAVE A NEW INSPIRATIONAL POPE. NO MATTER HOW TOUGH THINGS SEEM WE CAN FIND SOLACE AT LEAST IN HIS PROFOUND MESSAGE OF PEACE. HE DEMONSTRATED THAT AGAIN WITH A MOVING PRAYER FOLLOWED BY THE SYMBOLIC RELEASE OF TWO WHITE DOVES.
ONE OF THE DOVES WAS ACTUALLY ATTACKED BY A SEAGULL THE OTHER BY A BLACK CROW. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY. YOU MAY SEE THAT AS A CHILLING OMEN OF PEACE, TORN ASUNDER BY THE FORCES OF VIOLENT CHAOS. I SEE A BLACK CROW AND A WHITE SEAGULL PUTTING ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES TO WORK TOGETHER. WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE FINE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
