Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FREE LANCE  JOURNALIST. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "POUND  FOOLISH" DISCUSSING THE PERSONAL  FINANCE INDUSTRY. HELAINE OLEN, HELLO.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US. THE BOOK IS CALLED -- THE MUSIC  OF PARTICULARLY LONG -- CALLED  "POUND FOOLISH." EXPOSING THE DARK SIDE OF  PERSONAL FINANCE INDUSTRY. THAT INTIMATES THAT THERE'S A  LIGHT SIDE TO THE PERSONAL  FINANCE INDUSTRY. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON --  AFTER LOOKING AT THIS SORT OF  PERSONAL FINANCE GURUS ON CNBC WAS IS YOUR CONLIEWTION? WE WERE SOLD. IF THE 30 YEARS THE INCOMES HAVE  FALLEN, NET WORTH PLUNGED 40%  BETWEEN 2007 AND 2010 AND THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY OF EVERYTHING  FROM SUZE ORMAN SAYING HEY WE  HAVE THE ANSWER WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU. ALSO FORGETTING TO MENTION THIS  THEY WERE SELLING THE PRODUCTS  THAT WERE GOING TO HELP YOU.
Jon: IN MANY WAYS THEY HAVE  A SIM BEOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH  THE CORPORATIONS THEY COVER.
SUZE ORMAN IS SELLING  PRODUCTS. SHE HAS HER OWN PREAPPROVED  DEBIT CARD AND BOOKS AND TAPES.
Jon: A PERSONAL THING LIKE  THAT CNBC IS THE ONE THAT  STRIKES ME. HERE IS THIS STATION OS  STENSIBLY FINANCIAL JOURNALISTS  AND IF THEY MENTION A STOCK IT GOES UP.
WHETHER THEY MENTION IT IN A  POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WAY. IT'S LIKE CHILDREN IF YOU GIVE  THEM NEGATIVE ATTENTION IT STILL  WORKS.
Jon: IT DOES? SO LONG PRAISE, CHILDREN. [ LAUGHTER ] RIGHT, EXACTLY. AND BUT YOU WRITE ABOUT AN  INTERESTING EFFECT THAT HAPPENS  WEEKS LATER.
IT GOES BACK DOWN. JIM KRAMER SOMEBODY DID A STUDY  OF HIS TICKS. BEST THING YOU COULD DO IF YOU  WANTED TO MAKE MONEY WOULD BE TO  IMMEDIATELY SHORT OR BET AGAINST ANYTHING HE MENTIONED AS A BUY. BECAUSE HEAR WHAT HE IS SAYING  AND THE PRICE GOES UP AND A  COUPLE WEEKS LATER IT COMES BACK  DOWN.
Jon: I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH  HIS WORK BUT SOME OF THE OTHER  PEOPLE. I THINK WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT  HERE IS THAT THERE IS THIS IDEA  NOW THAT WORK IS NOT ENOUGH.
RIGHT. WELL, IT ISN'T FOR MANY PEOPLE.
Jon: THAT IS THE POINT. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM  WITH THE SYSTEM. HUCKSTERS HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED.
RIGHT.
Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE THE  SYSTEM HAS SHIFTED.
WE HAVE 50% OF THE POPULATION  SAYING THEY ARE LIVING PAYCHECK  TO PAYCHECK. THERE'S AN INDUSTRY OF PEOPLE  SAYING YOU CAN'T MANAGE YOUR  MONEY FOLLOW ME. INSTEAD OF SAYING GOSH 50% OF  THE POPULATION CAN'T GET BY WHAT  IS WRONG WITH SOCIETY.
Jon: WHAT IS SO INFURIATING  TO ME IS THAT THIS IDEA ALONG  YOU ARE W- YOUR LIFE AND WORK AND ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED, YOU  NEED TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF  WITH THIS COMPLEX AND OBSCURE INDUSTRY OF EXPERTS TO AVOID  BEING HOMELESS AND POVERTY  STRICKEN WHEN YOU ARE OLDER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE DON'T  VALUE WORK MORE AND WHY  INVESTMENT HAS BECOME SO VALUED. THIS IS AN INDUSTRY EARNS  HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS A YEAR ON  YOU AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF REASONS TO CONVINCE YOU WHY YOU  NEED THEM. YOU CAN INVEST YOUR WAY OUT OF  THEM. THE EMPIRES OF PERSONAL FINANCE  BUILT UP IN PART AS A RESPONSE  TO CHANGES IN THE RETIREMENT  SYSTEM. IT USED TO BE WE GOT PENSIONS  AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE  PENSIONS.
Jon: YES.
WE NOW HAVE 401 (K)S. THEY DON'T DO AS WELL FOR  PEOPLE. BUT THEY DO REALLY WELL FOR ONE  SEGMENT AND THAT IS THE  FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY WHICH MAKES MONEY WIN OR LOSE.
Jon: AND THE 401 (K) IS A  SLUSH FUND IN MANY RESPECTS FOR  THE OTHER ADVENTURES, IS IT NOT? DON'T THEY TAKE THAT MONEY AND  BET ON THE DERIVE ACTIVES AND  ALL THE OTHER SHENANIGANS THAT ARE PLAYED.
IT COMES FROM ALL OVER THE  PLACE, THE HEDGE FUNDS, LORD  ALONE KNOWS WHERE A LOT OF THE  TIME.
Jon: CAN WE GET AHOLD OF  HIM --
IT WOULD HELP, RIGHT.
Jon: I BELIEVE HE IS AT  GOLDMAN SAVES. [ LAUGHTER ]
PROBABLY.
Jon: STEREOTYPE ALERT. STEREOTYPE ALERT. [ LAUGHTER ] IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS NOT ANY  KIND OF INFROM STRUCTURE IN  PLACE TO GET BACK TO THIS IDEA OF WORK BEING AS VALUED AS  INVESTMENT.
WELL, RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE  EARNING LESS AND LESS MONEY. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO  EARN MORE MONEY. RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE MIGHT  BE A GOOD PLACE TO START.
Jon: THEY DON'T -- THEY  ALWAYS CLAIM THAT THAT IS -- WE  HAVE TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL. I DON'T WANT TO RUN LATE. STAY BECAUSE REALLY WHAT ARE WE  GOING TO -- GET AN INTERNET  ACCOUNT AND YOU CAN WATCH IT. POUND FOOLISH IS ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW. IT IS A TREMENDOUS BOOK AND  BREAKS DOWN THIS FINANCIAL  INDUSTRY GAME THAT IS BEING  PLAYED. HELAINE OLEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
