Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS WE AND THE ROYAL WE, AS WE MOVE INTO THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON SOME RETAIL OUTLETS ARE ALREADY GEARING UP FOR BLACK FRIDAY. OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS ARE NOT.
TWO BARNEYS CUSTOMERS BOTH AFRICAN-AMERICAN CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN STOPPED AND DETAINED AFTER MAKING LUXURY PURCHASES. THEY SAID EARLIER THIS YEAR AFTER PAYING FOR THEIR ITEMS, BARNEYS SENT UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICERS TO STOP THEM ON THE STREET AND CHECK THE VALIDITY OF THEIR DEBIT CARDS.
Jon: SHOCKING! (LAUGHTER) I HAVE GOT TO SAY THAT A STORE OWNED BY SUCH A LOVABLE, TOLERANT DINOSAUR OF COLOR--  (LAUGHTER)  THE FACT THAT HE WOULD SUBMIT ANYBODY TO THIS HUMILIATION AND  HARASSMENT-- WHAT'S THAT? REALLY? DIFFERENT BARNEY, OKAY. (LAUGHTER) NOT PURPLE. OKAY, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE. (LAUGHTER) MAYBE THIS IS JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING.
KAYLA PHILIPS A 21-YEAR-OLD NURSING STUDENT WAS STOPPED BY POLICE AFTER SHE USED HER TAX REBATE TO BUY A $2300 BAG FROM BARNEYS. TRAYON CHRISTIAN A 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT WHO BOUGHT A $350 FERRAGAMO BELT SAID HE WAS STOPPED AND HANDCUFFED BY UNDERCOVER COPS.
Jon: OKAY, WELL, MAYBE IT WAS THE FASHION POLICE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I MEAN HONESTLY BLACK FERRAGAMO BELT WITH BROWN LOAFERS? (LAUGHTER) SO YOU THINK BARNEYS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PREPARED FOR BLACK CUSTOMERS GIVEN THAT THEY'RE A MONTH AWAY FROM LAUNCHING A HOLIDAY PRODUCT LINE WITH HIP-HOP LEGEND JAY-Z. I GUESS THEY FORGOT TO HAVE THE STAFF MEETING WHERE THEY SAID GUESS WHO'S COMING TO BARNEYS. LOOK-- WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW.
JAY-Z IS FACING PRESSURE TO BOW OUT OF HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HIGH-END RETAILER.
MORE THAN 16,000 PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED AN ON-LINE PETITION DEMANDING JAY-Z END HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH BARNEYS. THIS PUTS JAY-Z IN A RATHER AWKWARD POSITION.
Jon: WELL, YEAH, NOT AS AWKWARD A POSITION AS SITTING HANDCUFFED IN THE BACK OF A SQUAD CAR WEARING THE $300 BELT YOU JUST PAID FOR. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE AWKWARD, BUT JAY-Z-- LISTEN, IN HIS DEFENSE, JAY-Z IS DOWN, THE GUY WHO PROTESTED THE ZIMMERMAN VERDICT FOR BEING RACIST, HE BOYCOTTED THE GRAMMYS FOR BEING RACIST. EVEN BOYCOTTED CHAMPAGNE FOR BEING RACIST. SORRY BARNEYS, THIS IS GOING TO GET UGLY, TELL HIM HOVA.
FOR NOW HE'S STANDING BY BARNEYS. IF I MAKE SNAP JUDGEMENTS NO MATTER WHO IT'S TOWARDS AREN'T I COMMITTING THE SAME SIN AS SOMEONE WHO PROFILES?
Jon: WOW. IS THAT JAY-Z QUOTING JAY--SUS? FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT MR. LARRY WILMORE, LARRY? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JAY-Z DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. (LAUGHTER) [BLEEP] I'M MIKE MYERS IN THIS CONVERSATION, AREN'T I? OH GOD.
LET ME FINISH. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE WHO WANT HIM TO BOYCOTT BARNEYS. AND I DON'T BLAME HIM, JON.
Jon: ISN'T THIS AN OUTRAGE? IF BLACK PEOPLE ARE BEING STOPPED AND FRISKED WHILE SHOPPING.
SHOP AND FRISK IS WHAT THE MEDIA CALLS IT. BROTHERS JUST CALL IT SHOPPING. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, AND BY THE WAY, MAKE UP YOUR MIND, AMERICA, YOU CAN'T TELL BROTHERS TO PULL UP OUR PANTS AND ARREST US WHEN WE TRY TO BUY A BELT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ENTRAPMENT.
Jon: BUT BECAUSE OF THAT WOULDN'T IT BE HELPFUL FOR JAY-Z TO TAKE A STAND.
WHY, JON, WHAT DO YOU THINK JAY-Z IS, AL SHARPTON WITH BETTER RHYMES? NO, HE'S GOT A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BRAND TO PROTECT.
Jon: BUT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME IF I MAY, IF I MAY, HE'S NOT A BUSINESSMAN, HE'S A BUSINESS, MAN.
YES, WELL RAPPED, JON. LOOK, THESE DAYS JAY-Z'S TOO BIG A COMMERCIAL FORCE TO RAIL AGAINST THE DANGER OF THE MAN. HE IS THE DANGER. HE IS THE ONE WHO FRISKS. HE'S NOT JAY-Z, HE'S JAY-Z PENNEY.
Jon: OR JAY-Z MORGAN CHASE.
OR JAY-Z PENNEY LIKE I SAID.
Jon: RIGHT.
ANYWAY I KNOW JAY-Z USED TO BE A GROUND BREAKING RAPPER, THEN HE TURNED 40, NOW HE IS A RAPPER THAT SHOWS UP AT GROUND BREAKINGS.
Jon: HOLY CRAP, CAN I SEE THAT AGAIN. OH MY GOD. WHAT'S HE DOING THERE WITH MAYOR BLOOMBERG AND A  SHOVEL?
HE'S BURYING THE REMAINS OF HIS STREET CRED, JON. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT.
YEAH.
Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT.
IT'S TOUGH BUT JON THIS IS A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE.
Jon: IN WHAT WAY.
WELL, JOHN, BECAUSE IT MEANS WE'RE CATCHING UP. WHITE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THEIR MUSICAL ICONS SELL OUT TO CORPORATIONS FOR DECADES. IT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND WE'RE FINALLY ACHIEVING IT. YOU GO JAY-Z PENNEY. YEAH, MAN. AND JON, JON, IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S THE ONLY HIP-HOP STAR WHO IS SWAPPING HIS GLOCK FOR STOCK. 50 CENT MADE 100 MILLION OFF HIS SUGAR WATER, DR. DRE A QUARTER BILLION FOR HIS HEAD PHONE BUSINESS AND YOU HAVE SEEN ICE CUBE'S BEER COMMERCIALS? HE'S SELLING COORS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS. IT USED TO BE [BLEEP] WITH ATTITUDE, NOW IT IS [BLEEP] WITH ALTITUDE.
Jon: I THOUGHT OF THAT BUT I FIGURED IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FUNNIER IF YOU SAID IT.
CORRECT.
Jon: SO YOU ARE SAYING WE'RE JUST WITNESSING THE MATURATION OF RAP AS AN ART FORM.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. OUR MUSIC REBELS CAN'T BE RABBLE ROUSERS FOREVER. BUT HE'S STILL JAY-Z, IT'S JUST THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HIM DOING THIS, IT MAY BE FOR HIS NEW DANDRUFF AD. HE'S GOT 99 PROBLEMS BUT HIS SCALP ITCH AIN'T ONE.
Jon: LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
