FROM COMEDY CENTRAL WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR SHOW TONIGHT IS A FINE ONE. MY GUEST TO THE IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES, MR. DAVE GROHL WILL BE JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION. BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS HERE ON THE PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT FROM THE GRAND JURY DECISION IN MISSOURI FAILING TO INDICT THE OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING DEATH OF MICHAEL BROWN. WE DID OUR BEST HERE TO PROCESS THOSE EVENTS. EVEN ENJOYED ACTUALLY A BIT OF FUN ACTUALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE ST. LOUIS RAMS AND THE ST. LOUIS POLICE ASSOCIATION, TWITTER WAR. AND I KNOW, I KNOW DOING THOSE BITS HELPS NO ONE OTHER THEN MAYBE US HERE AT THE SHOW INDIVIDUALLY AS A CREATIVE OUTLET, A CATHARSIS A WAY OF PROCESSING EMOTION THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE UNDIGESTED. BY THE WAY, THAT PROCESS BROUGHT TO YOU BY ARBY'S. ARBY'S, YOU THINK PAIN AND GRIEF ARE HARD TO DIGEST. [LAUGHING] BUT ANYWAYS. AT LEAST THAT PROCESS HAS BEGUN. AND WE WERE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD EVER SO SLOWLY HOPING THAT WE MIGHT AS A COUNTRY HAVE A RESPITE OF THESE TYPES OF INJUSTICES. AND WE DID HAVE A RESPITE FOR MAYBE [BEEP] WHAT TIME IS IT? > NO INDICTMENT IN THE DEATH OF ERIC GARDNER. A GRAND JURY IN NEW YORK CITY HAS DECIDED NOT TO CHARGE THE WHITE POLICE OFFICER IN THE DEATH OF AN UNARMED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IF COMEDY IS TRAGEDY PLUS TIME I NEED MORE [BEEP] TIME. BUT I WOULD REALLY SETTLE FOR LESS [BEEP] TRAGEDY TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.  YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT IS SO UTTERLY DEPRESSING IS NONE OF THE AMBIGUITIES THAT EXISTED IN THE FERGUSON CASE EXIST IN THE STATEN ISLAND CASE. AND YET THE OUTCOME IS EXACTLY THE SAME. NO CRIME, NO TRIAL, ALL HARM NO FOUL. IN FERGUSON, AT LEAST YOU HAD CONFLICTING WITNESS TESTIMONY, YOU HAD CONFLICTING FORENSICS. YOU HAD THE SPECTER AT LEAST OF POLICE SELF DEFENSE. BUT HERE THERE IS NONE OF THAT. THE CORONER CALLED IT HOMICIDE. THE GUY IS NOT ACTING THREATENING. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT THROUGH WITNESS TESTIMONY UNRELIABLE BYSTANDERS BUT BECAUSE WE ARE [BEEP] WATCHING IT. SOMEONE TAPED IT. A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THE WHITE HOUSE PROPOSED MORE CAMERAS ON COP VESTS AS A SOLUTION TO THIS TYPE OF VIOLENCE. I ASSUME THAT THE SOLUTION THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING IF IMPLEMENTED WOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THE ERIC GARDNER CASE. I MEAN, MAYBE, TO LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE WE'RE ABOUT TO SAVE OURSELVES A [BLEEP] LOAD OF MONEY ON COP CAMERA VESTS. BUT DAMN. WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT LIVING IN A POST-RACIAL SOCIETY. AND I CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WONDERING HOW MUCH OF A SOCIETY WE'RE LIVING IN AT ALL. AND THAT'S OUR SHOW. SO CHA-CHA-CHA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT JUST HAPPENED. SO I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY DIGEST IT. I'M GONNA NEED A SEGUE, I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE PIECE OF VIDEO FOOTAGE TO CHANGE THE MOOD HERE. [LAUGHING] OKAY. IT'S NICE. I LIKE IT. ALTHOUGH, IN MY CURRENT FRAME OF MIND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER, OH OF COURSE THE WHITE CAT IS GETTING A MASSAGE. AHHH! [BEEP] WELL NOW I'M AT LEAST READY FOR SOME GOOD NEWS, SOME POSITIVE NEWS. MAYBE SOMETHING FROM THE UNITED STATES SENATE.
THE SENATE CONFIRMED NEW AMBASSADORS TO ARGENTINA AND HUNGARY TODAY.
Jon: THERE YOU GO. NORMALLY AFTER THE PHRASE "THE SENATE HAS CONFIRMED" YOU GET THIS.
NOTHING, YOU LOSE. GOOD DAY, SIR.
Jon: BUT THEY DID IT. THEY DID SOMETHING. AND ARGENTINA AND HUNGARY, MAN, THAT AIN'T NOTHING. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT COUNTRIES. ARGENTINA IS ONE OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE'S LARGEST ECONOMIES, GOING THROUGH A DEBT CRISIS. HUNGARY IS BEING GOVERNED BY LIKE A PUTIN DEMAGOGUE TYPE FELLA. THESE ARE CRITICAL POSTS! AND I'M GLAD THAT OUR SENTATE WAS ABLE TO PUT ASIDE ITS CULTURE OF PARTISAN DIVISIVENESS AND DO SOMETHING NOBLE AND GOOD FOR THIS COUNTRY. LET'S MEET OUR NEW AMERICAN EMISSARIES TO THE WORLD.
NOAH MAMET IS NOW THE AMBASSADOR TO ARGENTINA.
HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR NEVER STEPPING FOOT IN ARGENTINA.
HE DOESN'T  SPEAK SPANISH.
Jon: QUE? DONDA ESTA HIS QUALIFICATIONS. ALTHOUGH, I CAN SEE GETTING SOMEONE TO REPRESENT US IN ARGENTINA WHO IS FLUENT IN SPANISH WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. I MEAN, BARELY TWO-THIRDS OF OUR POPULATION SPEAKS IT. WELL, MAYBE THE AMBASSADOR TO HUNGARY WILL REDEEM OUR SELECTION PROCESS.
HUNGARIAN AMBASSADOR COLLEEN BELL USED TO BE A SOAP OPERA PRODUCER. SHE ADMITTED IN HER HEARING, SHE COULD NOT NAME THE U.S. INTERESTS IN THAT REGION.
Jon: OKAY, OKAY, MAYBE SHE CAN'T NAME THE INTERESTS IN THAT REGION. SHE'S A SOAP OPERA PRODUCER. SHE CAN HELP US WHEN HUNGARY'S PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN'S WIFE WAKES UP FROM A SEVEN-YEAR COMA  JUST IN TIME TO TO CALL OFF HER DAUGHTER'S WEDDING TO A MAN WITH AMNESIA WHO TURNS OUT TO BE A WOMAN WHO'S PREGNANT WITH THE ILLEGITIMATE SON OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S EVIL TWIN, FERNANDO. ALL THIS ON TOMORROW'S ALL MY HUNGARIANS. HOLD ON A SECOND, I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT EARLIER IN THE YEAR WE COVERED THESE PEOPLES' CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AND THEY SEEMED TERRIBLE TOO. BUT THERE WAS SOME SPECIAL QUALIFICATION THAT THEY DID HAVE. WHAT WAS THAT?
BELL DID RAISE 1.4 BILLION DOLLARS FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN.
MAMET GENERATED MORE THAN $500,000 FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RE-ELECTION.
Jon: WELL, THEN THEY ARE FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OUR NATION'S FIRST DIPLOMAT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. NO, NOT THAT ONE. THERE YOU GO. OF COURSE ULTIMATELY THE SENATE WAS MERELY CONFIRMING AMBASSADORS HAND PICKED BY THE PRESIDENT. THE WHITE HOUSE'S RESPONSIBILITY. MEANING YESTERDAY IT WAS TIME FOR THE PERSON HOLDING WASHINGTON'S WORST JOB TO HAVE A LOUSIER DAY THAN USUAL.
AMBASSADOR BELL HAS THE PRESIDENT'S CONFIDENCE THAT SHE WILL DO AN EXCELLENT JOB.
WHERE DOES THE PRESIDENT GET THAT CONFIDENCE?
SHE CERTAINLY IS SOMEBODY THAT, AGAIN, HAS HER OWN DISTINGUISHED PRIVATE SECTOR CAREER.
AS A SOAP OPERA PRODUCER, RIGHT.
WELL, AND SOMEONE WHO HAS OBVIOUSLY SUCCEEDED IN, YOU KNOW, IN THE BUSINESS WORLD. [LAUGHING]
Jon: HOW MUCH DOES THAT GUY WANT TO JUST REACH OVER AND TAG OUT? JUST GIVE A QUICK ONE TO JAY CARNEY OR MAYBE ROMAN REIGNS OR MAYBE ONE OF THE USOS OR MAYBE BRAY WYATT OR PERHAPS BRUNO SAMMARTINO COULD -- I HAVE BEEN WATCHING WRESTLING FOR A VERY LONG TIME. ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, EARNEST.
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT THE FACT THAT SHE HELPED RAISE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER APPOINTMENT. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT CAN YOU?
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT THE REASON THAT SHE WAS CHOSEN. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE REASON SHE WAS CHOSEN -- I, FRANKLY, I WAS NOT A PART OF THIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS.
Jon: WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT IS THE GREATEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN THE PRESIDENT'S PRESS SECRETARY DO. HIS ENTIRE JOB, HIS ONLY JOB IS BUILT AROUND TRYING NOT TO GO HEY LOOK, I JUST [BEEP] WORK HERE. BUT THAT'S WHAT HE DID. TAKE IT UP WITH MY SUPERVISOR. EARNEST OUT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
