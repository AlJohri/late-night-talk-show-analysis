Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT HAS A NEW FILM OUT CALLED "TOTAL RECALL"
I HAVE BEEN LOOK FOR YOU EVERY WRMENT. SUDDENLY YOU SHOW UP.
YOU'RE MARRIED?
SAFE TO SAY WE'RE SEPARATED.
HERE, YOU DRIVE.
THAT'S TOTALLY HOW I DRIVE. PLEASE WELCOME JESSICA BIEHL.
Stephen: .
Jon: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANKS ARE FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: VERY COOL.
SUPERCOOL HOVER CARS, HERE IS WHAT DISTURBED ME WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE CLIP AND HALFWAY THROUGH I  CHANGED MY MIND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IN THE FUTURE THE WHEEL WAS ON THE BRITISH SIDE. WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT AMERICA IN A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE --
GONE.
Jon: GONE.
OUT.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT IS THE MARK OF AN EMPIRE. IS YOUR ABILITY TO DICTATE WHAT SIDE OF THE ROAD PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE DRIVING ON.
THAT'S TRUE BUT IF YOU NOTICE.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY. YOU SWITCHED THE [BLEEP] WHEEL.
WE SWAPPED IT, IT CAN SLIDE.
Jon: IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN DRIVE WHEREVER YOU WANT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT  NOW HERE'S MY GUESS. I'M NOT A MAN OF VISION OF THE FUTURE, THEY DID NOT INVENT HOVER COVERS SO, WHAT  ARE YOU IN, LIKE NOTHING. ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE WHERE ARE YOU IN A GREEN FOAM THING LIKE --
RIGHT, NO, ACTUALLY, USUALLY YOU PROBABLY WOULD BE. THEY ACTUALLY WHETHER THE THESE INCREDIBLE CARS THAT THEY THEN YOU DON'T KNOW HOW  THEY STUCK IT ON A RACE CAR, BUT THEY HAD TWO RACE CAR DRIVERS DRIVING OUR HOVER CAR THAT WAS ON TOP OF A RACE CAR. ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME HERE.
Jon: MI SEEMS SOMEWHAT INEFFICIENT. THEY PUT A CAR ON TOP-- HOW DO THE GUYS IN THE OTHER RACE CAR SEE.
WE'RE NOT COVERING THEIR WE'RE JUST SORT OF PERCHING ON TOP.
BUT THERE IS LIKE 40 OF THOSE THINGS OUT THERE.
SO A LOT OF THE ONES AROUND US THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE THAT WERE PRACTICAL. WE'RE GOING 60 MILES AN HOUR DOWN AN OLD UNUSED AIRSTRIP.
Jon: WHERE IS THIS AIRSTRIP.
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW.
Jon: I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. AND ARE THERE ALIEN CORPSES THERE. SO YOU ARE ACTUALLY MOVING YOU'RE DRIVING AROUND.
WHICH IS WHY WE CAN HIT EACH OTHER. THE RACE CARS ARE WERE COMPLETELY FINE. IT WAS TER FIING. I EXPECTED TO GO FLYING OFF. SOMETIMES THE DOOR WOULDN'T CLOSE, THE SEAT BELT WOULD BREAK. JUST CROSSING YOUR FINGERS.
Jon: THEY THROUGH THESE CARS TOGETHER OUT OF CARDBOARD AND DUCT TAPE.
YEAH.
Jon: AND GLUED TO THE TOP OF ANOTHER CAR.
SCREW WAS FALL OUT AS WE WERE DRIVING.
Jon: DID THE RACE CAR GUYS EVER LET YOU DRIVE YOUR RACE CARS.
NO, WE DIDN'T GET TO DRIVE THEIR RACE CARS.
Jon: THEN YOU HAVE FAILED US.
I'M SORRY, SHOULD I GO. I SHOULD JUST LEAVEMENT I'M REALLY SORRY.
Jon: YOU'RE STEPPING INTO SOMETHING HERE THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT. BECAUSE IT'S A-- THESE TYPES OF PHILIP K DICK, THE SCI-FI MADNESS, I HAPPEN TO BE A  BIG FAN OF HIS. THE ORIGINAL WITH SCHWARZENEGGER UP SET ME TERRIBLY, BUT I LOVED IT.
IT'S GREATMENT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, IT'S FUN.
Jon: A WOMAN'S HEAD COMES OFF AND IT'S A BOMB. FOR GOD'S SAKE.
EYEBALLS COME OUT, AMAZING.
Jon: THREE BREASTED, PROBABLY, AMAZING.
IT'S GOOD.
Jon: DO THEY TAKE YOU THROUGH S THERE SOMETHING, DO YOU GUYS GO BACK AND REREAD THE NOVELS AND COME-- BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL  DOESN'T TAKE PLACE ON MARS. THIS ONE DOESN'T TAKE PLACE ON MARS, IT TAKES PLACE LIKE THE WAY IT WAS IN THE BOOK.
SO WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT THE SHORT STORY AND THAT'S WHAT GLEN, OUR  DIRECTOR, THAT'S THE IMPETUS FOR THIS PARTICULAR REIMAGINATION, REBOOT, WHAT  YOU WANT TO CALL IT. IT IS A DIFFERENT MOVIE. IT IS NOT A REMARK OF THE ORIGINAL. IT IS TAKEN FROM THE SOURCE MATERIAL MORE THAN ANYTHING.
Jon: AN COLIN FARRELL IS SHORTER.
YEAH SHORTER.
Jon: AND YOU'RE NOT RIPPLE-- TIKITIN.
Jon: IS IT-- IT IS A GOOD NAME TIKITIN.
TIKITIN.
Jon: DOW MIND IF I JUST CALL THAT YOU FOR NO REASON.
WOULD YOU PLEASE.
Jon: I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO. SO THIS THING COMES OUT T GOES THROUGH THE THING AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO JESSICA  BIEL, WHAT IS THE NEXT THING FOR YOU?
WHAT AM I DOING NEXT?
Jon: YEAH.
I'M ACTUALLY UNEMPLOYED.
Jon: IS THAT REALLY TRUE.
THANK YOU. I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.
Jon: SO WHAT, ARE YOU-- DO YOU HAVE, HOW DO YOU FILL TIME, LIKE MY  CHILDREN ARE AWAY A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW SO I FIND THAT I AM-- DON'T DO ANYTHING. I HAVE NO, BECAUSE I'M OLDER AND MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN I DON'T HAVE ANY  PREFERENCES OF MY OWN.
OF COURSE.
Jon: SO WHEN THEY'RE GONE, I REALIZE I NO LONGER KNOW HOW TO FILL MY TIME. SO I JUST SIT QUIETLY.
THAT SOUNDS KIND OF WONDERFUL, I GUESS.
Jon: UNTIL MORNING.
RIGHT.
Jon: OKAY. DO YOU HAVE THINGS THAT ARE MORE FULFILLING THAN THAT OR --
I SIT QUIETLY BUT I SIT WITH MY DOGS. WE SIT QUIETLY TOGETHER.
Jon: I AM GOING TO GET DOG.
WHEN THE KIDS ARE OUT OF THE HOUSE GET THE DOGS.
Jon: YOU HAVE JUST INSPIRED ME.
ANY TIME.
Jon: I AM EITHER GOING TO GET A DOG OR STEAL TWO KIDS AND MAKE THEM WEAR FUR. TOTAL RECALL, IN THE THEATRES ON FRIDAY. JESSICA BIEL.
