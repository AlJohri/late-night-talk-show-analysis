FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS ON STEWART! MY GUEST TONIGHT, WE' HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU, DREW BARRYMORE IS GONNA BE JOINING US. BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN HONOR OF FLEET WEEK, WE BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND THE SEEMINGLY UNENDING PROBLEMS IT IS PROVIDING TIMELY MEDICAL CARE WITH SOME HOSPITALS GOING SO FAR AS TO ACTIVELY COVER UP THIS PROBLEM. A SITUATION I THINK BEST SUMMED UP THUSLY --
(BLEEP)!
Jon: THAT SOUNDS RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, BY THE WAY, NO ONE IS MORE UPSET ABOUT THIS THAN THE LIONS OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATE.
THE V.A. ISSUE IS A NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT AND THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO IT IS AN EMAPARTMENT.
"TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CAUSES OF MY PRESIDENCY." WELL THEN YOU FAILED. HE NEEDS TO TREAT THESE STORIES AT LEAST AS SERIOUSLY AS HE DID THE OBAMACARE  WEB SITE FIASCO.
Jon: OH, HE TAKES THE V.A., HE TURNS IT INTO OBAMACARE, IF HE GRABS BENGHAZI, THE TRIFECTA! YES, THESE REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR OUR VETERANS! WHEN THEY THINK IT CAN HELP THEM SLAM THE PRESIDENT. IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WHEN THEY THINK NO ONE IS WATCHING.
A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE EXTENDED HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION FOR VETERANS GETTING REJECTED IN THE SENATE, A LACK OF SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS DOOMED THIS BILL.
Jon: WHAT? YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY THE LACK OF SUPPORT OF THIS BILL FROM REPUBLICANS IS A NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT. THAT GETS EMBARRASSMENT-IER.
SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL TRIED TO ADD AN UNRELATED POISON PILL AMENDMENT TO THAT VETERANS BILL THAT WOULD IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN.
Jon: I'LL JUST SLIP THIS -- THIS POISON PILL IN THERE... (LAUGHTER) IF ANYONE SAW IT, SURE WOULD SEEM HYPOCRITICAL... (LAUGHTER) THEN I'LL REWARD MYSELF WITH A -- A CABBAGE LEAF. (LAUGHTER) BUT, OF COURSE! AS THE PRESIDENT'S CRITICS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT, PRESIDENT OBAMA KNEW ABOUT THE V.A. BACKLOG PROBLEMS BEFORE HE WAS EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THIS MEMO PREPARED FOR PRESIDENT ELECT OBAMA'S TRANSITION TEAM BY THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION OUTLINED THE DIFFICULTIES VETERANS FACED IN OBTAINING TIMELY HEALTHCARE.
Jon: PROVES TWO THINGS -- ONE THIS, PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE ENOUGH TO END THIS BACKLOG AND, TWO, THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT HADN'T DONE ENOUGH TO END THE BACKLOG! >>SO THE PROBLEMS EXISTED ON THE DAY PRESIDENT BUSH LEFT OFFICE.
NO, NO, NO. NO. NO. NO IT DIDN'T. NO, NO, NO. BY IMPROVING SYSTEMS, IT GOT DOWN TO AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 161 DAYS BY THE TIME THAT BUSH LEFT OFFICE. BY 2012, IT WAS BACK UP ABOVE THE 230 THAT WE INHERITED WHEN WE CAME INTO OFFICE TO 260.
Jon: YEAH YOU GET THAT? EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE AND HE'S  BRAGGING BECAUSE HE GOT THE VETERANS AVERAGE WAIT DOWN TO FIVE OR SIX MONTHS, WHILE SOMEWHAT FORGETTING THAT A GOOD REASON IT JUMPED BACK UP TO SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS WAS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S DOING AS WELL. SO, I GUESS ROVE IS SAYING THE BUSH ERA V.A. WARNED THE OBAMA TEAM NOT TO UNSOLVE THE PROBLEM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HADN'T SOLVED EITHER. THAT'S SO DISINGENUOUS EVEN BILL "BEYONCE-HUNTER" O'REILLY  CALLS BULL (BLEEP).
THE V.A. ITSELF MADE A REPORT TO THE INCOMING OBAMA PEOPLE.
NO, NO, NO. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS NOT A V.A. REPORT. IT IS A REPORT FROM PEOPLE ASSIGNED BY THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN TO THEIR TRANSITION PLANNING. THESE WERE PROBABLY DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON.
YOU'RE WRONG. THIS COMES FROM --
NO, NO HERE LET ME DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS. NO, NO, NO, LET ME DESCRIBE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, BILL. YOU ARE CONFLATING AGAIN.
I HAVE TO GO ON THE RECORD, MR. ROVE. MR. ROVE, I HAVE TO GO ON THE RECORD.
I KNOW, BUT LET ME FINISH, BILL.
NOPE.
SEE, THIS IS WHY I LIKE O'REILLY. HE'S LIKE FOX NEWS' INCREDIBLE HULK. SURE, HE'S USUALLY JUST A MINDLESSLY AGGRESSIVE FORCE OF DESTRUCTION. BUT POINTED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, HE BECOMES A HERO. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR -- AS TRADITIONS GO, MISTREATING OUR VETERANS IS A FULLY BIPARTISAN ENDEAVOR. AS WE'LL SOON FIND OUT AS WE TAKE A JAUNT DOWN "TERRIBLE MEMORY LANE." WHAT'S UP, MAN! WHAT'S UP? THE 1980s! GIRLS JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN! AND REAGAN JUST WANTED TO HAVE GORBACHEV TEAR DOWN THAT WALL! WHILE MEANWHILE THE V.A. WAS TELLING THEIR RESEARCHERS TO UNDERREPORT THE NUMBER OF V.A. HOSPITALS WITH AN INORDINATELY HIGH MORTALITY RATE. AND AMERICA FELL IN LOVE WITH A FAMILY CALLED THE SIMPSONS. NOT FAR ENOUGH BACK? ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S UP, MAN? IN THE 1960'S,  THE BEATLES EXPERIMENTED WITH "THE WHITE ALBUM," WHILE IN VIETNAM THE MILITARY WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH A "DIFFERENT" COLOR. AGENT "ORANGE." DON'T WORRY, TROOPS, THIS GROOVY HERBICIDE WON'T CAUSE YOU ANY HARM. UNLESS YOU CONSIDER CANCER AND NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE HARM. WHOAH, I JUST HAD A VISION, THAT 20 YEARS FROM NOW THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IS GONNA DENY FEDERAL LIABILITY IN AGENT ORANGE CONTAMINATION, AND SUPPRESS EVIDENCE OF HARM TO VIETNAM VETERANS. A SITUATION THAT WON'T BE RECTIFIED FOR ANOTHER 20 YEARS AFTER THAT -- MAN! NOT FAR ENOUGH? ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT THIS? THE YEAR WAS 1932! AND WHILE MOST OF AMERICA WAS BEING SERVED DELICIOUS SOUP, 10,000 WORLD WAR I VETERANS MARCHED ON WASHINGTON TO GET THE WAR BONUSES THEY'D BEEN PROMISED 15 YEARS AGO SAID THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, "WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT BONUS IN THE FORM OF TEAR GAS AND AN ESCORT OF TANKS?"
CONGRESSMEN LEFT THROUGH BACK DOORS AND UNDERGROUND TUNNELS TO AVOID CONFRONTATIONS.
I KNOW WHO'S MADE THIS COUNTRY WORTH LIVING IN. IT'S JUST YOU FELLAS. LOOK, IT MAKES ME SO DAMN MAD, A WHOLE LOTTA PEOPLE SPEAK OF YOU AS TRAMPS, BY  GOD THEY DIDN'T SPEAK OF YOU AS TRAMPS IN 1917 AND 18, NO!" (CHEERS)]
I'M WITH YOU, RETIRED GENERAL BUTLER IT MAKES ME SO STEAMED, WHY I'VE GOT A SWEAR JAR RIGHT HERE THAT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON THERE! HOLD ON. DON'T DO IT YET! HERE WE GO. (BLEEP) (BLEEP) (BLEEP). (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) BY THE WAY, OH, BY THE WAY, LET'S LOSE ALL THIS. I WISH BREAKING PROMISES TO VETERANS WAS A 20th CENTURY INNOVATION, BUT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WALK THROUGH ALL THE WAYS THEY GOT SCREWED IN THE 19th CENTURY, LET'S JUST JUMP BACK TO THE FIRST WAR. THE NUMBER ONE, THE NUMBER ONE SONG WAS -- THAT ONE WITH THE FLUTE, AND EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY WAS WATCHING THAT HIT SHOW -- GOING TO SLEEP BECAUSE THE SUN WENT DOWN. BUT A LACK OF A CONSTITUTION DIDN'T MEAN WE THE PEOPLE COULDN'T STILL SCREW THE THE VETERANS. WHICH IS WHY IN 1783, A FEW DISGRUNTLED FORMER REVOLUTIONARY FIGHTERS TOOK CONGRESS HOSTAGE TO TRY TO GET THE MONEY THEY WERE PROMISED. THEY WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH. WORRY NOT, THE SENTENCES WERE COMMUTED! BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR VETERANS. SO, LET'S PRETEND THAT THIS CURRENT V.A. CRISIS IS AN ANOMALY CREATED BY ONE UNUSUALLY CALLOUS AND INEFFECTIVE PRESIDENT. BUT THAT WOULD BE JUST PRETEND. OR ON THIS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND EVE WE CAN FINALLY ADMIT THAT AMERICA HAS HAD FOR OVER 200 YEARS A GREAT BIPARTISAN TRADITION OF HONORING THOSE WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM BY (BLEEP) THEM OVER ONCE THEY GIVE THEIR GUNS BACK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
