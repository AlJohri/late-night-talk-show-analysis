(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. LAST WEEK HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, PRESIDENT OBAMA ATTENDED A $40,000-A-PLATE FUND-RAISER HOSTED BY SARAH JESSICA PARKER. REALLY NICE PLATES. OUR CELEBRITY STUDDED FUND RAISING EVENTS, ARE THEY APPROPRIATE IN THESE TROUBLED TIMES? IS A MAPT A BEE HAS MORE
Reporter: AS A FAMOUS PERSON IN NEW YORK I SCIEP WITH A LOT OF MY FAMOUS FRIENDS. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND MICHELLE ARE COMING TO MY HOUSE FOR DINNER ON JUNE 14. I WANT YOU TO BE THERE TOO.
ME? OH, MY GOD. LET ME GET THIS DOWN. YOU'RE TALKING TOO FAST
GO TO JOIN OBAMA DOT-COM FOR YOUR CHANCE TO WIN AND THE CONTEST ENDS TOMORROW NIGHT  BECAUSE WE NEED HIM AND HE NEEDS US
HE NEEDS ME. BUT WHY NOW? IT'S BEEN FOUR YEARS. I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS? SHOULD I GO TO THE PARTY OR NOT?
WHY ARE YOU NOT MOVING? HELLO. ARE YOU OKAY? I FELT LIKE I NEEDED THE ADVICE OF ONE OF MY BEST PALS. DID IT FEEL LIKE FOUR YEARS AGO HE WAS SO... NOW ALL HE EVER DOES IS ASK ME FOR MONEY.
BUT WHAT THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS MORE THAN ANYTHING IS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY'RE GOING TO GET THAT AND LOOK FOR THAT WHEREVER THEY CAN
WHAT ABOUT MY NEEDS? I HAVE NEEDS TOO.
BARACK WOULD TELL YOU, LOOK, HE'S BEEN TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS IN THE ECONOMY WHERE THEY'VE ADDED OR SAVED AT LEAST  FOUR MILLION JOBS, IN HEALTH CARE WHERE THEY PASSED A BIG HEALTH CARE BILL
I HAVE SOME OPINIONS ABOUT THIS
HE FOLLOWS ME EVERYWHERE AVE YOU TRIED TO CALL HIM? WHAT? MAYBE PLAN A FUN WEEKEND AND GIVE HIM A SELECTION OF TEAS.
I'M SORRY. WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.
SORRY. I WAS EVEN MORE CONFUSED. HE SEEMED TO THINK THESE FUND-RAISERS WERE JUST BUSINESS AS USUAL. IT JUST FELT SO DIRTY TO ME. AND SPEAKING OF DIRTY... THAT WAS AMAZING. WHAT WAS THAT THING YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE? WOW.
WELL, THE SUPREME COURT HAS DESTROYED THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY. I MEAN, THEY'VE OPENED THE DOORS, UNLEASHED UNLIMITED CONTRIBUTIONS, SECRET MONEY
IN THE FIVE MINUTES THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU, ALL YOU TALK ABOUT IS MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.
ALL OF THIS MONEY IS CORRUPTING OUR POLITICS. BY THE WAY, SARAH JESSICA PARKER, THAT WAS YEARS AND YEARS AGO. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS SCENE?
YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE REALLY BEING A DOWNER. OH, MY GOSH. YOU'VE BEEN SITTING THERE THIS WHOLE TIME? OKAY. CAN YOU NOT TAKE THE TEMPERATURE OF A ROOM? THINGS ARE TENSE HERE.
Reporter: I WAS GETTING A LOT OF MIXED MESSAGES. I NEEDED HELP SO I RACED OVER TO SEE JESS. I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW HER MY KILLER NEW SHOES. SOMEBODY, HELP ME. MY SHOES ARE SO COMFORTABLE. I NEEDED TO BE QUOTED BY SOMEONE NEW.
OH, NO, I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS. THERE IS THIS ONE OTHER GUY FROM MASSACHUSETTS. HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. IT'S JUST SO WEIRD, YOU KNOW
YEAH. I'M SORRY. WHO ARE YOU IN THIS?
I'M THE BLACK FRIEND THERE WEREN'T ANY BLACK FRIENDS THOUGH. GET ME OUT OF THIS AWKWARD SOCIAL SITUATION. MY FRIEND ESSY WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO. SHE ALWAYS GRIFFS ME SUCH GOOD ADVICE
IT LOOKS BACK. IT'S BAD FOR OBAMA TO THROW THIS FUND-RAISER AND HOBNOB WITH HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES WHEN WE  STILL HAVE 82.2% UNEMPLOYMENT
SOMETIMES SHE GIVES TOO MUCH ADVICE
A LOT PEOPLE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR...
YOU'RE HAVING A MONO LOG MOMENT. SHE NEVER HAD A GOOD THING TO SAY ABOUT HIM ANYWAY. YOU KNOW, HE MAY HAVE BROKEN PROMISES TO ME. BUT I WAS GOING TO BE THERE FOR HIM. BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, I WASN'T QUITE ACTUALLY DIRECTLY INVITED. WOULD YOU MIND? AND IT COST $40,000 CASH TO GET IN. DO YOU ACCEPT AM-EX?
NO, MA'AM I GUESS I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE WHAT HE NEEDED RIGHT NOW, POWERFUL FRIENDS AND AN ENORMOUS AND AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT.
