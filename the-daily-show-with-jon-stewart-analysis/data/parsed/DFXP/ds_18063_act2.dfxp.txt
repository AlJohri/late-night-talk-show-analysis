[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. TEA PARTY. THE TEA PARTY. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT THE TEE  PARTY BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO  FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS THEY HOLD MOST DEAR BOTH ON LAND AND AT  SEA. AL MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
THE TEA PARTY MADE A SPLASH  IN THE 2010 ELECTION AND DESPITE  THE DEBATE AUTHOR MICHAEL COULD COUGHLIN THINKS THEY'VE NEVER  BEEN MORE RELEVANT.
WE DIDN'T MAKE AS BIG AN  IMPACT IN THE 2012 ELECTION AS  WE DID IN 2010 BUT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY ARE DOING GOOD WORK  AND ARE RELEVANT.
GOOD WORK.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT LOSE THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET INTO  STATE RIGHT ISSUE LIKE RIDING THE MANATEE.
I'M CONFUSE THE WHAT DOES  THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE TEA  PARTY?
THAT STANDS FOR LIBERTY AND  FREEING AND DO WHAT WE WANT TO  DO WITHOUT HARMING ANYONE ELSE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE A  MANATEE.
THE FLORIDA TEA PARTY PUT  THEIR PATRIOTS ON DOUBLE RED  ALERT AFTER SEEING THIS.
ANYA GLORIA GARCIA GUTIERREZ  WAS ARRESTED AFTER BEING  PHOTOGRAPHED RIDING A MANATEE.
THE TEA PARTY DECIDED TO  DEFEND THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF  OUR FREEDOMS, MANATEE RIDING.
OUR GOALS ARE TO SAVE  MANATEES AND GO TO WORK WHEREVER  THEY ARE THREATENED BY BOATS OR BY COLD OR JUST PEOPLE NOT  UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPORTANT IT  IS TO SAVE THEM.
BUT THE TEA PARTY KNOWS THE  SLIPPERY SLOPE TO TYRANNY BEGINS  ON A MANATEE'S BACK.
WE'RE LOSING OUR FREEDOMS  PIECE BY PIECE. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT THE  PIECE YOU LOSE IS NOT OF  INTEREST TO ME SO I DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE  MANATEE RIDERS.
YES.
AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE I  DID NOT RIDE A MANATEE.
ABSOLUTELY.
TODAY WE CAN'T RIDE A  MANATEE, TOMORROW WE WON'T BE  ABLE TO OPEN A BUSINESS.
JUST WANT TO SAVEMAN TEASE.
BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE  ENDANGERS SPECIES ACT ISN'T TO  PROTECT SPECIES IT'S TO DENY PEOPLE PRIVATE PROPERTY.
NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT  EITHER.
IF THE ANIMALS RIGHTS PEOPLE  GET THEIR WAY, THEY ARE TALKING  ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN WHOLE COMMUNITIES, RIPPING THEM OUT OF  GROUND, TAKING OUT HIGHWAYS. THE UNITED NATIONS IS GOING TO  TURN THE CIVILIZED WORLD, THE  WESTERN WORLD INTO A THIRD WORLD  NATION. NO.
DESPITE THE NAYSAYERS THEY  SEE THE RIGHT TO LIBEL BER AT  THIS.
WHY SHOULD AMERICA SUFFER TO  PLEASE THIS NONTHINKING --  NONSENSE CALL, SLOW THINKING  MINORITY.
BEAF THEY ARE POWER. THEY ARE IN THE POLITICAL  SYSTEM, EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND  IT'S REALLY DESTRUCTIVE.
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE  MANATEE PEOPLE OR THE TEA PARTY?
THE TEA PARTY --
I'M TALKING ABOUT MANATEE  PEOPLE.
ALL RIGHT. THAT MAKES SENSE.
IN THE END THE TEA PARTY  SIMPLY YEARNS FOR A MORE  TRADITIONAL AMERICA.
PEOPLE USE USED TO RIDE  MANATEES ALL THE TIME. THEY ARE A LOT OF FUN.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS FUN,  THE MONKEY THAT RIDES THE DOG AT  RODEOS. THEY CAN SAY MONKEY, YOU CAN'T  RIDE THAT DOG.
OR YOU CAN'T MAKE THAT MONKEY  RIDE THAT DOG.
YOU THINK THEY ARE MAKE THE  MONKEY RIDE THE DOG? I THOUGHT THE MONKEY WANTED TO  RIDE THE DOG.
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD  INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY TO HAVE MONKEYS TRAINED TO RIDE  DOGS.
IF THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE  TRYING TO STOP, I'M IN.
SURELY THE TEA PARTY PATRIOTS  KNOW WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. LIKE PAUL REVERE BEFORE ME, I  WOULD RIDE TO WARN AMERICA NO  MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES. IT WAS TIME TO EXERCISE MY  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS AN  AMERICAN.
RIDE THEMAN TEASE.
FIRST I HAD TO ENDURE THE  JACK BOOTED ECHO PROP AND GOOD  YANCH YOU CAN REACH OUT AND TOUCH THEM WITH AN OPEN HAND BE  VERY GENTLE.
SORT OF LIKE STRIP CLUB  RULES. GIVE THEM EXTRA MONEY AND YOU  GET TO GO IN THE BACK. I KNOW THE DRILL. MY MOMENT HAD ARRIVED. AS I LOOKED UPON THE MAJESTIC  BEASTS, ONE QUESTION CAME TO  MIND:  WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO RIDE A MANATEE? WHY NOT HOSE DOWN A COUCH AND  RIDE THAT? IF THAT IS WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP  THE U.N. FROM SEIZING EVERYONE'S  PRIVATE PROPERTY THEN
