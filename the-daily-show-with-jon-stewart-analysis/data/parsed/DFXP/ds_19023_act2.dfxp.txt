Jon: I HAVE VERY GOOD NEWS. AS OF TODAY NEW YORK'S NEW MAYOR ISN'T THE ONLY THING ABOUT NEW YORK CITY THAT IS FREAKISHLY TALL.
IT'S OFFICIAL NOW. THE NEW WORLD TRADE CENTER BUILDING IN NEW YORK CITY IS NOW THE TALLEST SKYSCRAPER IN THE COUNTRY. NOW THE TALLEST SKYSCRAPER IN THE COUNTRY.
Jon: WHOOO! WHEN WE DO IT, WE DO IT BIG IN CELEBRATION. OF COURSE, WITH THE-- BUT STILL TALLEST BUILDING IN AMERICA. AND WE WEREN'T ALWAYS SURE IT WOULD HAPPEN.
AN INTERNATIONAL PANEL OF ARCHITECTS RULED THAT THE NEEDLE ATOP ONE WORLD TRADE CENTER IS A SPIRE, NOT JUST AN ANTENNA AND IS THUS A PERMANENT PART OF THE BUILDING.
IT'S THE SPIRE ON TOP THAT MAKES IT THE TALLEST BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES.
Jon: OH YEAH! (LAUGHTER) SPIRE ON TOP. OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY THE ONLY CONCERN WITH HAVING A SPIRE LIKE THAT ON TOP OF A NEW YORK SKYSCRAPER IS KEEPING STRIPPER KING KONG OFF OF IT. (LAUGHTER) PUTTING HIMSELF THROUGH GIANT APE COLLEGE. NOW I SUPPOSE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOW NUMBER ONE, UNFORTUNATELY, SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO BE NUMBER TWO.
IT TOPPED CHICAGO'S WILLIS TOWER WHICH HELD THE TITLE FOR FOUR DECADES.
I THINK THIS IS LESS ABOUT THE COMPETITION OF THE CITIES THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS BUILDING.
Jon: YOU KNOW, POPI, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BRINGS ALL AMERICANS TOGETHER. WHAT KIND OF AN [BLEEP] WOULD SEE THIS AS A COMPETITION.
TO ALL THE EXPERTS ARE GATHERED IN ONE ROOM. IF IT LOOKS LIKE AN ANTENNA, ACTS LIKE AN ANTENNA, THEN GUESS WHAT IT IS AN ANTENNA.
TODAY ON THIS WONDERFUL SUNNY DAY IN CHICAGO YOU ARE STANDING IN THE TALLEST OCCUPIED SPOT IN A BUILDING THAT YOU CAN STAND IN NORTH AMERICA. AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE REGARDLESS OF THE DECISION MADE BY THE COUNCIL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT-- WILLIS TOWER. WHAT YOU--  (APPLAUSE) FINE, FINE! WE'LL TAKE TALLEST BUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES AND YOU CAN HAVE TALLEST OCCUPIED SPOT IN A BUILDING YOU CAN STAND IN NORTH AMERICA. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW WHAT, CHICAGO, WHAT ARE YOU SO MAD ABOUT. WE ALREADY GAVE YOU GUYS MURDER CAPITOL OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU  REALLY THINK WE CAN'T KILL MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU? (LAUGHTER) PLEASE. WE LET YOU WIN. COME ON. LET'S NOT DO THIS. THEY'RE BOTH GREAT BUILDINGS, BOTH GREAT CITIES, I LOVE CHICAGO,  YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S HAVE A TOAST. A LITTLE TOAST TO NEW YORK AND CHICAGO. WE'LL HAVE-- OH, A LITTLE GER TRUDE BERTRAM-- DID WE REALLY-- IS THIS REAL? OH. I THINK IT WOULD BE GINGER ALE BUT IT'S NOT. A TOAST TO PEACE BETWEEN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO.
WHILE NEW YORK CITY WON TODAY, IT'S NO CONTEST WHICH CITY TAKES THE CAKE WHEN IT COMES TO, WELL, JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.
DEEP DISH PIZZA IS QUITE GOOD (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: OKAY. I WAS GONNA BE NICE. BUT NOW YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING. DEEP DISH PIZZA IS NOT ONLY NOT BETTER THAN NEW YORK PIZZA, IT'S NOT PIZZA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT'S A [BLEEP] CASSEROLE. (LAUGHTER) I'M SURPRISED YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT TO COMPLETE YOUR DEEP DISH PIZZA BY PUTTING SOME CANNED ONION RINGS ON TOP OF IT. IT'S A CORN BREAD BISQUIT WHICH YOU MELTED CHEESE ON AND THEN IN DEFIANCE OF GOD AND MAN AND ALL THINGS HOLY YOU POURED UNCOOKED MARINARA SAUCE ATOP THE CHEESE, ATOP, THE CHEESE, ON TOP, THE SAUCE, NAKED, ON DISPLAY LIKE SOME SORT OF SAUCE WHORE. YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BAD SEX OR BAD PIZZA. YOUR PIZZA IS LIKE SEX WITH A CORPSE MADE OF SAND PAPER. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THIS IS NOT PIZZA! THIS IS TOMATO SOUP IN A BREAD BOWL. THIS IS AN ABOVEGROUND MARINARA SWIMMING POOL FOR A RAT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR [BLEEP] NOT PIZZA! I WANT TO KNOW WHEN I GET DRUNK AND PASS OUT ON MY PIZZA THAT I AM NOT GOING TO DROWN. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING-- I LOOK AT THIS -- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I LOOK AT THIS, YOU SON OF A BITCH, I LOOK AT THIS -- -- ALL RIGHT, WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR DEEP DISH PIZZA, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO EAT IT OR THROW A COIN IN IT AND MAKE A WISH. AND IF I MADE A WISH IT WOULD BE THAT I WISH FOR SOME REAL [BLEEP] PIZZA! NOW, NOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I REALIZE IT'S VERY COLD IN CHICAGO, VERY COLD. IT'S WINDY, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO I DON'T KNOW, HAVE A PIZZA AND MAYBE CUT IT OPEN AND CLIMB INSIDE IT TO KEEP WARM. SERIOUSLY, WHO ARE YOU KIDDING? WHO USES AN IRON SKILLET TO MAKE A PIZZA? YOU DON'T USE AN IRON SKILLET TO MAKE A PIZZA. YOU USE IT TO FEND OFF SOMEONE WHO TRIES TO SERVE YOU A [BLEEP] PIZZA MADE WITH AN IRON SKILLET. HERE'S HOW I KNOW I'M RIGHT. YOU CALL IT CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA. YOU CALL IT DEEP DISH PIZZA, STUFFED PIZZA. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL IT, UH? YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL THIS? YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL THIS? PIZZA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) OH, THAT'S NICE. AND BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T PUT TOMATO AND CELERY ON HOT DOGS EITHER. EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE ARE THREE ACCEPTABLE CONDIMENTS, ONIONS, MUSTARD AND STAGNANT CART WATER.
