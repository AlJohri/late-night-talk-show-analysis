Jon: THE TAG LINE OF THE FILM IS DON'T TALK TO ANYONE, DON'T TOUCH ANYONE. I'M SURE YOU DON'T KNOW THIS, THAT IS ACTUALLY THE MOTTO OF NEW|ï¿½ YORK SUBWAY SYSTEM. [ LAUGHTER ] WE HAVE IT IN LATIN RIGHT OVER --
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING EITHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN TOUCHED BY ANYONE.
Jon: HAS THIS EFFECTED -- HAVE YOU IN ANYWAY GERMO PHOBIC OR A BIT OF A HYPOCHONDRIAC?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: I AM AS WELL.
WE SHARE THAT. THAT'S WHY WE DON'T TOUCH EACH OTHER.
Jon: WHEN THEY BROUGHT YOU A SCRIPT ABOUT DISEASE DID YOU THINK TO YOURSELF AT ANY POINT  THIS IS GOING TO SCARE JON STEWART? [ LAUGHTER ]
WELL, HONESTLY, NO. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NEXT TIME I READ ANY SCRIPT I WILL THINK ABOUT YOU OR WHAT MIGHT SCARE OR WHAT YOU MIGHT  LOVE --
Jon: IT'S ALMOST EVERYTHING. [ LAUGHTER ]
WOW.
Jon: IT'S NOT EASY BEING ME.

IN THAT CASE TALKING TO THOSE PEOPLE AND NOT TALKING TO THEM AND KNOWING WHAT THEY DO WILL  NOT COMFORT ME BECAUSE IT DOESN'T -- EVEN THOUGH THEY TRY TO HANDLE THE THING TO FIND THE  ORIGIN AND TO CONTAIN THE DISEASE, IT'S THERE.
THE DISEASE IS THERE?
