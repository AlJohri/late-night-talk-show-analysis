[APPLAUSE] [CHEERS]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT -- YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR FROM THEIR CO-CREATION OF HBO'S MR. SHOW, OR YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THEM ON "THE DAILY SHOW" JUST MINUTES AGO. THEY'VE CO-WRITTEN A NEW BOOK CALLED "HOLLYWOOD SAYS NO: ORPHANED FILM SCRIPTS, BASTARD SCENES AND ABANDONED DARLINGS FROM THE CREATORS OF MR. SHOW." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, BOB ODENKIRK AND DAVID CROSS. [APPLAUSE] [CHEERS] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: SORRY. IT'S JUST TO SEE YOU TWO TOGETHER -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: -- JUST BEFORE DOING A SKETCH, IT JUST BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES.
IT GIVES YOU ASTHMA?
Jon: IT GIVES ME ASTHMA. THE BOOK IS CALLED "HOLLYWOOD SAID NO." THESE ARE REAL MOVIE SCRIPTS?
THESE ARE REAL MOVIE SCRIPTS THAT WE WROTE, AND HOLLYWOOD REALLY SAID NO VERY LOUDLY, MANY, MANY TIMES. IT TOOK US FOREVER TO HEAR IT.
Jon: I READ THESE, AND THEY'RE TRULY AMAZING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY COULD READ THESE AND SAY, NO, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
YOU WORK IN HOLLYWOOD.
Jon: I WORK ON 11th AVENUE. NOBODY SAYS NO HERE.
WE WROTE THESE SCRIPTS AFTER "MR. SHOW," THE SHOW WE DID ON HBO, WHICH JON WAS A PART OF.
JON WAS IN MR. SHOW.
Jon: MY FAVORITE SKETCH WAS THE ROCK BAND WHO INSPIRED A KID TO COMMIT SUICIDE, AND WENT TO VISIT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL. THE SHOW WAS JUST GREAT. YOU'RE DOING A TOUR OF IT NOW, YES?
WELL, WE'RE DOING SOME NEW SKETCHES AND STAND-UP COMEDY TO PROMOTE THIS BOOK AND SEE OUR FANS, WHO WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN SO LONG.
Jon: HOW DO THEY LOOK?
A LITTLE IN THE MIDDLE -- THEY COULD WORK OUT.
THEY COULD SKIP A HAMBURGER ONCE IN A WHILE.
Jon: IT IS PRETTY MUCH TWO FULL FILM SCRIPTS?
YES. ONE IS A SKETCH MOVIE, AND ONE IS A SATIRE THAT IS AS TRENCHANT TODAY -- I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.
Jon: IT'S IN A WHO?
IT'S LIKE UNDERGROUND, A TRENCH.
IT IS THE CHUNNEL OF --
Jon: BUT BOB AND DAVID MAKE A MOVIE --
THAT'S A SKETCH MOVIE.
FROM THE MOMENT YOU DO IT, I ENVISION THAT BIG BOOM SHOT FROM THE BEGINNING OF MR. SHOW, AS IT CAME TOGETHER.
YES. WE HAVE LITTLE SKETCHES IN THERE, LIKE A GREAT '50s SCI-FI FILM CALLED "ONE-EYED ALIENS FROM PLANET MARS," IN WHICH THEY SCARE THE HECK OUT OF AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE A CERTAIN PART OF THE ANATOMY. AND EUROPEAN PEOPLE ARE FINE WITH THEM. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DON'T MAKE THE AUDIENCE WORK SO HARD.
THE OTHER SCREENPLAY IN THERE IS CALLED "HURRAY FOR AMERICA." IT IS A SATIRICAL LOOK AT AMERICA.
AND THE ELECTION PROCESS, AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
Jon: WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE ELECTION PROCESS IN AMERICA?
NOTHING, SIR.
Jon: OKAY. I WAS GETTING A LITTLE, WHOA! LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT, BABY. DO YOU PUT IT OUT TO SAY, HEY, MAN, LET'S STILL DO THIS?
NO. NO, NOT AT ALL. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THESE ARE IN BOOK FORM BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'LL NEVER MAKE THEM. THEY WERE WRITTEN FOR YOUNG, BRASH COMEDY.
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT POWDER UP HERE. THE POWDER BUDGET WOULD JUST -- FORGET IT.
YOU COULD NEVER DO IT.
Jon: DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU? BECAUSE I DO THE POWDER THING, BUT THE MORNING ON THE PILLOW --
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT ME FOR THIS CONVERSATION.
Jon: NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE POLITE.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ALTHOUGH I GREW THE BEARD OUT AND I MISS IT SO MUCH. IT'S LIKE HAVING A FRIEND WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES. HAVE YOU EVER GONE --
I HAD A BEARD FOR "RUN, RONNIE, RUN." I GREW A REAL BEARD, AND IT SCARED THE HECK OUT OF MY KIDS. I CAME BACK FROM FILMING AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS. SO, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION TO THAT IS? YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD YOUR WIFE GROW A BEARD IN YOUR ABSENCE. THAT WAY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRANSITION.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [LAUGHTER]
BUT MY WIFE IS A BEARD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE'VE BROKEN NEWS. NEWS HAS BROKEN. HOW DOES THAT -- DO YOU WATCH -- YOU BOTH GO AND DID ALL OF THESE WONDERFUL SHOWS, "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT," AND DO YOU WATCH EACH OTHER?
OF COURSE.
Jon: DO YOU TEXT EACH OTHER AND SAY --
I'M ON TV! I WAS LATE TO "BREAKING BAD," BUT I STARTED BINGE WATCHING IT, AND I FREAKED OUT OVER HOW GOOD IT IS. IT IS ARGUABLY THE BEST SHOW EVER ON TELEVISION.
Jon: PRETTY GREAT.
AND BOB TOLD ME HOW IT ENDS, AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT.
Jon: OKAY.
AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT.
Jon: LET'S HEAR IT.
A TIME MACHINE -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DID YOU REALLY TELL HIM? I DON'T KNOW HOW IT ENDS.
I DIDN'T READ THE LAST PART BECAUSE I'M A FAN OF THE SHOW, TOO. THEY SEND ME THE SCRIPT AND I'M, LIKE, I'M NOT READING THIS. I DON'T WANT TO CARRY THAT AROUND WITH ME, THE BURDEN OF LOOKING INTO ALL OF THE HUNGRY EYES AND GOING, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.
Jon: ZOMBIES REACHING OUT TO YOU. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. "HOLLYWOOD SAID NO," ON BOOKSHELVES NOW.
AND "THE BIRTHDAY BOYS," OCTOBER. IFC.
Jon: BOB ODENKIRK AND DAVID CROSS.
