FEBRUARY 21, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW" MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THIS IS... THIS TONIGHT WILL BE A GOOD EPISODE OF OUR PROGRAM. HOW GOOD? FORMER THREE-TERM WISCONSIN SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD GOOD. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FEINGOLD, JERRY, FEINGOLD. WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN NEW JERSEY WHERE I WAS VERY PROUD LAST FRIDAY TO SAY THAT THE STATE  LEGISLATURE, THE STATE WHERE I GREW UP VOTED TO LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE MOST EVENTS IN NEW JERSEY, IT WAS  IMMEDIATELY THROWN OFF COURSE BY A LOUD ITALIAN GUY.
A BILL LEGALIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE APPROVED BY THE NEW JERSEY LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN  VETOED BY CHRISTIE.
I BELIEVE THAT THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE AS IT'S TRADITIONALLY KNOWN IS BETWEEN  ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN AND THAT IT SHOULD STAY THAT WAY IN NEW JERSEY. (BOOS).
Jon: IN N NEW JERSEY... HEY, PIPE IT DOWN! (LAUGHTER) IN NEW JERSEY WE BELIEVE MARRIAGE SHOULD BE AS IT ALWAYS WAS INTENDED BETWEEN ONE  INDICTED ORANGE-FACED MAN AND A WOMAN WITH HIGH BANGS AND DEAD EYES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) CHRIS CHRISTIE... HOW YOU DOING? HOW YOU DOING? NICE TO SEE YOU? HOW YOU DOING? CHRIS CHRISTIE SEEMS TO HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY. SPECIFICALLY, THE EQUALITY PART. IT'S SURPRISING SINCE HE, TOO, IS A MEMBER OF A GROUP SOCIETY DOES NOT ALWAYS GRANT A FULL MEASURE OF RESPECT. I'M REFERRING, OF COURSE, TO CHRISTIE'S CHOICE TO LIVE OPENLY AS AN OBESE AMERICAN. (LAUGHTER) I WONDER WHAT HIS POSITION WOULD BE ON THIS MARRIAGE QUESTION IF  THE NATIONAL DISCUSSION WENT THUSLY.
I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF FAT MARRIAGE. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN REDEFINE MARRIAGE. FAT MARRIAGE IS WRONG. WE FOUGHT HARD AND PREVENTED MASSACHUSETTS FROM BECOMING THE LAS VEGAS OF FAT MARRIAGE.
NEW YORK IS A PLACE WITH LOTS OF FATS BUT I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF FAT MARRIAGE. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I MEAN HONESTLY, IT MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS STOPPING GAY MARRIAGE. SO GET OVER IT, CHRISTIE. BUT, HEY, VETOING BILLS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PREROGATIVE. IN VIRGINIA, THEIR GOVERNOR BOB McDONALD IS SIGNING A BILL COMING OUT OF HIS LEGISLATURE. I WONDER IF IT'S TO LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE.
THE LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE ANY WOMAN GETTING AN ABORTION TO FIRST HAVE A TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND.
OH, MAN! TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND! THE 15-MEMBER JAZZ FUSION CHORUS BAND? THOSE GUYS ARE AWESOME! I SAW THEM AT THE BEACON IN '94! THEY WERE AMAZING! TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND! ♪ TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND... ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WAIT A MINUTE. OH, NOT THE BAND, THE OTHER WITH THE WAND AND THE HOO HOO. (LAUGHTER) YES, THAT VIRGINIA LAW IS THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT  OF THE PEW FANNY STATE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF ABORTIONS HAVE PERFORMED IN THE  FIRST TRIMESTER, IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET AN ULTRASOUND IMAGE AS THE LAW REQUIRES THE LAW STATES  ANY WOMAN SEEKING TO HAVE THE LEGAL PROCEDURE KNOWN AS AN ABORTION MUST, WHETHER SHE WANTS  TO OR NOT, FIRST LAY BACK IN A CHAIR HER SPREAD LEGGED FEET IN STIRRUPS AND HAVE AN EIGHT TO  TEN INCH WAND PUT INSIDE HER. EVEN IF THE WOMAN IN QUESTION IS PREGNANT AS A RESULT OF A RAPE. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A JOKE HERE. I JUST THOUGHT I'D TELL YOU. ON THE PLUS SIDE, THE WOMEN WOULD NOT BE FORCED TO LOOK AT THAT IMAGE. SEE? SO IT'S ALL GOOD. DURING THE ENTIRE WAND FORCIBLY INSERTED IN YOUR MOST PRIVATE AREA EXPERIENCE YOU STILL HAVE  COMPLETE AND TOTAL CONTROL OVER WHAT DIRECTION YOUR HEAD IS TURNED. SO JUST SET YOUR IPOD TO SHUFFLE, FLIP THROUGH A COPY OF "VANITY FAIR" AND IGNORE THE  FACT YOU'RE BEING HANDLED LIKE A HUMAN POPSICLE. OKAY. FEEL LUCKY? VIRGINIA COULD HAVE FORCED YOU TO WATCH THE IMAGE LIKE IN THE DISTOPIAN CLASSIC "CLOCKWORK  ORANGE." BUT INSTEAD, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE COMING AT YOU WITH A GIANT  PHALLIC OBJECT LIKE IN "CLOCKWORK ORANGE." (LAUGHTER)  AT THIS POINT I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK. WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD INTRODUCE A BILL THAT INFRINGES ON WOMAN'S RIGHT TO SUCH A DEGREE?
THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED BY LYNCHBURG DELEGATE KATHY BYRON.
A LADY? (BOOS).
Jon: AND BY THE WAY, LYNCHBURG? ENOUGH WITH THE LIN-SANITY, OKAY? (LAUGHTER) DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO HAVE A "LIN" IN FRONT OF IT. SAY THE NAME OF THE TOWN, INCHBURG. NO TOWN IN 2012 IN THE SOUTH WOULD BE NAMED AFTER A HEINOUS ACT AGAINST ITS MOST... WHAT'S THAT? (LAUGHTER) REALLY? ALL OVER THE SOUTH? WELL, THAT IS LIN-SENSITIVE. (LAUGHTER) LOOK, I GUESS KATHY BYRON ADVOCATES SUBSTITUTING GOVERNMENT INTRUSION FOR  PATIENTS' PERSONAL MEDICAL DECISIONS.
STATE EFFORTS TO MANDATE THE H.P.V. VACCINE TO MINORS HAVE RAISED A VARIETY OF CONCERNS. THE SUBSTITUTION OF OUR JUDGMENT FOR THE JUDGMENT OF PARENTS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT  INTRUSION INTO HEALTH CARE THAT AMERICA REJECTED AT THE POLLS LAST NOVEMBER.
Jon: I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. ALL I HEARD WAS YOU SUPPORT AMERICANS REJECTING INTRUSIVE POLES AND... (LAUGHTER). THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LOOK AT THAT (BLEEP)ING THING. SERIOUSLY. I KNOW MOST DOCTORS BRAG ABOUT THE SIZE OF THESE BUT, SERIOUSLY. (LAUGHTER) AND GOVERNOR BOB McDONALD, HE'S FOR THE MANDATORY ULTRASOUNDS. IS THERE ANYTHING HE CONSIDERS TOO INTRUSIVE?
FULL-BODY PATDOWNS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT GOING THROUGH THE T.S.A. LINES. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY OVER THE LINE WITH REGARD TO PEOPLE'S  CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AND THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES.
OKAY, OKAY. (BOOS).
Jon: THEY'RE NOT BOOING, THEY'RE SAYING "BRUCE." (LAUGHTER) WE DID EARLIER A SPRINGSTEEN STRONG. LET ME EXPLAIN THE CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AND LIBERTY IN THE BILL YOU'RE ABOUT TO SIGN. WOMEN MIGHT CONSIDER THIS BILL A T.S.A. PATDOWN INSIDE THEIR VAGINA. (LAUGHTER) AND BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT THAT VIRGINIA LEGISLATORS DON'T  UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF FORCED VIOLATION. THE SPORTERS OF THIS MANDATORY ULTRASOUND BILL BELIEVE MANY THINGS RISE TO THAT LEVEL. FOR INSTANCE, VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN DELEGATE BOB MARSHALL BELIEVES THAT THE HEALTH CARE  REFORM BILL PUT FORTH BY OBAMA IS NOT REGULATION OF VOLUNTARY COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE, MORE  ADOWN FORCIBLE ECONOMIC RAPE. SEE IN BOB MARSHALL FEELS LIKE HAVING TO BUY SOMETHING YOU DON'T WANT IS LIKE BEING RAPED. OH, THE CABLE PACKAGE I WANT HAS TO HAVE THE LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK? NO! STOP RAPING ME! (LAUGHTER) WHEREAS HAVING SOMETHING SHOVED INSIDE YOUR GENITALS AGAINST YOUR WILL IS NOT RAPE. HE THINKS THAT'S NOT RAPED. IT'S LIKE A REGIONAL SKWEURBG. LIKE SOME PLACES IN THE COUNTRY CALLED SODA POP. I GUESS WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE REPUBLICANS BEING THE PARTY OF  PERSONAL LIBBER ANY DON'T THEY REMEMBER THIS GUY?
THE NINE MOST TERRIFYING WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE  ARE "I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP."
Jon: I GOT NINE SCARIER WORDS FOR YOU. (AS RONALD REAGAN) "I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THIS WAND'S A LITTLE COLD."
