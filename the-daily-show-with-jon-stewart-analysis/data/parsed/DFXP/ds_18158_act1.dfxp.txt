Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW MY NAME IS JON STEWART, BIG SHOW, ROBIN WILLIAMS GOING TO BE JOINING US, BUT FIRST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE BE ON THE CUSP OF A SEA CHANGE IN U.S. IRANIAN RELATION.
IRAN'S NEW PRESIDENT HASAN ROUHANI TOUCHED DOWN IN NEW YORK.
ROUHANI WAS ELECTED IN JUNE AS A MODERATE CANDIDATE WHO ADVOCATED IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
Jon: ROUHANI IS A MODERATE AS WELL AS AN ACCOMPLISHED MANDY PATINKIN IMPERSONATOR. GONE ARE THE DAYS OF AHMADINEJAD AND THE HARMFUL STEREOTYPE OF THE CRAZY AMERICA-HATING ANTI-SEMITIC MEMBERS ONLY JACKET WEARING IRANIAN PRESIDENT. BUT HOW DIFFERENT CAN THIS ROUHANI GUY BE.
THOUGH IRAN USUALLY BLOCKS IRANIANS FROM TWITTER, NOW ROUHANI IS TWEETING.
THE SURPRISING AND UNPRECEDENTED OUTREACH THAT BEGAN WITH ANOTHER TWEET TWO WEEKS AGO WISHING THE WORLD'S JEWS A HAPPY ROSH HASHANAH HOLIDAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. WELL THAT IS DIFFERENT, FINALLY IRAN HAS REACHED THE SAME LEVEL OF TOLERANCE AS YOUR LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP. NOT THAT ROUHANI'S WIPED THE WHOLE SLATE CLEAN.
LET ME ASK YOU, PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD SAID THE HOLOCAUST IS A MYTH. DO YOU AGREE?
I'M NOT A HISTORIAN, I'M A POLITICIAN.
Jon: MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH. HERE'S A TIP ON THE PLAYING OF THE I'M NOT A HISTORIAN CARD. IF SOMEONE ASKS YOU, PRESIDENT ROUHANI, DO YOU THINK THE SMOOT HAWLEY TARIFF CONTRIBUTED TO THE LENGTH OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION. YOU CAN BRING OUT I'M NOT A HISTORIAN. BUT WHEN THE QUESTION IS WAS THE HOLOCAUST REAL, I BELIEVE THE PROPER RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE [BLEEP] YEAH, YEAH, IT WAS REAL. YOU KNOW WHAT, FORGET THE HOLOCAUST, THAT CAME OUT WRONG. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS PERHAPS WITH ROUHANI AND OBAMA BOTH IN TOWN FOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY OUR NATIONS CAN REACH SOME SORT OF DETANTE, A PERSIASTROIKA, IF YOU--  (LAUGHTER) PRESIDENT OBAMA, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE OUR GUEST FEEL WELCOME.
IRANIANS HAVE LONG COMPLAINED OF A HISTORY OF U.S. INTERFERENCE IN THEIR AFFAIRS. AND OF AMERICA'S ROLE IN OVERTHROWING AN IRANIAN GOVERNMENT DURING THE COLD WAR.
Jon: WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY CALL IRANIANS COMPLAINERS FOR BEING MAD ABOUT US OVERTHROWING THEIR GOVERNMENT. I MEAN ARE YOU GUYS STILL WHINING ABOUT-- THAT WAS ONE COUP, ONE COUP! IT'S LIKE 60 YEARS AGO. MOVE ON DOT WHATEVS. MAYBE ROUHANI WILL DO BETTER WITH THE CHARM OFFENSIVE.
THE SO-CALLED IRANIAN THREAT WHICH HAS BEEN EMPLOYED AS AN EXCUSE TO JUSTIFY A LONG CATALOG OF CRIMES AND CATASTROPHIC PRACTICES OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES. THE ARMING OF THE SADDAM HUSSEIN REGIME WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS, SUPPORTING THE TALIBAN AND AL QAEDA ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF SUCH CATASTROPHES.
Jon: WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ALL DAY ABOUT WHO SUPPLIED ARMS TO SADDAM HUSSEIN AND THE TALIBAN. MAYBE IT WAS US -- I'M NOT A HISTORIAN. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION IN THE ROOM. MAYBE WE'RE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOU GUYS. AFTER ALL YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED. LET'S START WITH A SIMPLE GREETING.
WILL WE SEE A HISTORIC HANDSHAKE BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND IRAN'S NEW PRESIDENT.
THIS IS PERFECT. A HANDSHAKE, THE BEST WAY TO MEET SOMEONE AND SHOW THEM YOU'RE NOT HOLDING A SWORD.
THE HANDSHAKE, IT COULD HAPPEN. COULD TODAY BE THE FIRST TIME IN 34 YEARS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF BOTH COUNTRIES ACTUALLY SHAKE HANDS?
YOU KNOW, IT'S A TANTALIZING PROSPECT.
TANTALIZING. FELLA, IT'S A HANDSHAKE, NOT A HAND JOB. (LAUGHTER) SO THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY QUITE TANTALIZING. DID THEY SHAKE THINGS OUT. SHOULD I SEND THEM CONGRATULATORY PUREL OR WHAT.
THAT HANDSHAKE THAT MANY WERE ANTICIPATING BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT, WELL, FORGET IT. IN THE END THEY SAY IT WAS ALL QUOTE TOO COMPLICATED FOR ROUHANI BACK HOME.
OH, TOO COMPLICATED BACK HOME. HIS HANDS HAVE A FIANCEE IN IRAN, I GET IT. COME ON, MAN, HAVEN'T YOU HEARD, IF IT'S IN A DIFFERENT TIME ZONE HANDSHAKES DON'T COUNT. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY  SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, JESSICA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN THAT WE CAN'T EVEN SHAKE HANDS?
IT MEANS WE'RE RUN BY BABIES, JON. JUST [BLEEP] SHAKE HANDS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
HAVE YOU CHECKED IN ON THE WORLD LATELY? NEWS FLASH, IT'S FALLING APART. SYRIA, IRAN, JESSE PINKMAN THEY'RE ALL [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT DOES BREAKING BAD HAVE TO DO WITH THIS.
IT HOLDS UP A MIRROR TO OUR SOCIETY. BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AREN'T WE ALL JUST BREAKING BAD?
Jon: I SEE MYSELF AS MORE OF A NEW GIRL.
HEY IT DOESN'T MATTER. JON, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS IF THESE GUYS CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON THE MOST BASIC GESTURE, IT'S JUST SO PETTY. I MEAN, JON, IF CHRIS BROWN AND DRAKE COULD MAKE UP.
Jon: WHAT, NO, NO.
YEAH.
Jon: THEY MADE UP.
YES.
Jon: NO, WHEN.
IN VEGAS THIS WEEKEND. AND THEY WENT WAY FURTHER THAN HANDSHAKES, JON, THEY HUGGED IT OUT. AND IF THEY CAN GO FROM NO-MANCE TO BROMANCE IN ONE NIGHT WHY CAN'T OBAMA AND ROUHANI STAND A LITTLE HAND ON HAND CONTACT.
Jon: BY THE WAY WE'RE DRAKE IN THIS RIGHT.
HELL YEAH, IRAN IS CHRIS BROWN, YEAH. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: DOES THAT MAKE  RHIANA ISRAEL.
YES, EXACTLY. EXACTLY. I MEAN SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO EXIST AND ALL BUT SHE DOES SOME WACKY [BLEEP].
THE POINT IS, JON, IF THOSE TWO CAN SETTLE THEIR HIP-HOP BEEF SO SHOULD WE. OBAMA AND ROUHANI DIDN'T EVEN SHAKE HANDS. JUST TO EXTEND A GESTURE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SMALL, LIKE A HIGH FIVE, MAYBE POUND IT OUT.
Jon: FIST BUMP, COUPLE GUNS, BA BOOM.
TOTALLY. EVEN A SUP WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY.
Jon: WHY IS SHAKING HANDS SO HARD.
I DON'T KNOW. THEY COULD CONSIDER IT A CHANCE TO GAIN STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE WITH BIOLOGICAL WARFARE, LICK YOUR HAND, GIVE THE ENEMY A COLD, OR SOME HEPATITIS. THAT'S WHAT DRAKE DID.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT DRAKE DID?
YEAH.
Jon: REALLY?
I HOPE SO. I HOPE HE DIDN'T JUST HUG CHRIS BROWN FOR NO REASON.
Jon: THANK YOU, JESSICA
