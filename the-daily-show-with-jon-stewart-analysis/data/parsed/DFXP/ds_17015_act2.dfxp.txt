( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN COULD GO QUITE A BIT OF CAIN-BASED HUMOR OVER THESE PAST FEW DAYS.
YOU EVER HAD TO SETTLE A CLAIM, GIVEN MONEY, OR PAID SOMEONE BECAUSE OF A CLAIM OF  SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT?
AT THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION-- NOW, OUTSIDE OF THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION, ABSOLUTELY NOT. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THAT'S THE WHOLE-- "HAVE YOU EVER KIDNAPPED A BABY? OTHER THAN THE LINDBERG BOY, NO." ( LAUGHTER ) WAIT! SOMEBODY KIDNAPPED THE LINDBERG BABY! I'M SORRY, I GET ALL MY NEWS FROM THE "O "DAILY SHOW."  THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF HUMOR RIGHT THERE, THAT PARTICULAR PIECES OF HUMOR, WELL, IT UPSET  SOMEONE THEY CARE ABOUT VERY DEEPLY.
HOW COME JON STEWART GETS AWAY WITH A VERY, VERY RACIST RANT ABOUT HERMAIN CAIN? HE HORRIBLY STATED IN HIS IMITATION," HAVE YOU EVER KIDNAPPED A BABY OTHER THAN THE  LINDBERG BABY?" ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  OKAY, THIS HURTS ME ON TWO LEVELS. ONE, DONALD TRUMP REALLY THINKS THAT WAS MY HERMAN CAIN IMPRESSION? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) AND, TWO, DOESN'T DONALD TRUMP REALIZE THAT WASN'T EVEN THE  MOST OFFENSIVE ACCENT I USED IN THAT PARTICULAR BIT? YOU WANT SAUSAGE ON YOUR PIE? I JUST WANT TO GET IN THERE AND ( BLEEP )-- I JUST WANT TO ERRGQH! SO OFFENSIVE? AND THE CURSING. MYRON COHEN NEVER CURSED. ALWAYS WITH THE ( BLEEP ) THIS AND THE ( BLEEP ) THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'VE TAKEN CRITICISM BEFORE, BEEN CALLED A  RACIST, STUPID, AN ( BLEEP ). IT GOES WITH BEING A DICK FOR A LIVING. ( LAUGHTER ). IT'S AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD. BUT THIS ONE HURTS. BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH I RESPECT DONALD TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) HE IS THE SOPHISTICATED MAN. DID YOU KNOW HE EATS PIZZA WITH A FORK? ( LAUGHTER ) AND-- ( APPLAUSE ) AS TO THE CHARGES OF WHETHER I WAS BEING RACIST, IT TURNS OUT  DONALD TRUMP IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO JUDGE HE.
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BLACKS. I HAVE-- I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE BLACKS.
Jon:  THIS IS A MAN WHO HAS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH "THE BLACKS."  CLEARLY ONE OF THE BLACKS, UTILIZING THIS GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP, CALLED TO COMPLAIN. "MR. TRUMP, ONE OF THE BLACKS IS ON THE LINE." "PUT HIM THROUGH. TELL DONNIE I'LL TALK TO HIM LATER. I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE PEOPLE, THE BLACKS, PUT HIM THROUGH."  AND TO TRUMP'S CREDIT, TO TRUMP'S CREDIT, UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE, HE DOESN'T DISTINGUISH  WHAT TIME OF "THE BLACKS" HE HAS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH.
TO BECOME A BLACK REPUBLICAN, YOU DON'T JUST ROLL INTO IT. YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH THE FLOW. YOU HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST PROBABLY YR FAMILY MEMBERS, PROBABLY YOUR NEIGHBORS. YOU HAVE THOUGHT EVERYTHING OUT, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A VERY IMPRESSIVE BLACKS IN OUR PARTY. THAT'S WHY OUR BLACKS ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR BLACKS.
Jon:  OUR BLACKS. EVEN I'M OFFENDED BY THAT AND I'M A RACIST. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) BUT ANN COULTER RAISES A VERY VALID QUESTION-- ARE  CONSERVATIVE BLACKS BETTER THAN OTHER BLACKS? TO DISCUSS WE GO TO THE ( BLEEP ) ROUNDTABLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME. LET'S BEGIN-- TO START IT OFF, WYATT SENAC, YOU'RE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. ARE YOU OFFENDED BY WHAT COLSAID?
I AM, BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE TRUTH HURT. THE LEFT HAS THE QUANTITY, BUT THE RIGHT'S GOT THE QUALITY.
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE CREAM OF THE BLACK.
Jon:  UH-HUH, UH-HUH. IN WHAT REGARD?
IN EVERY REGARD, JON. THEY'RE STRONGER. THEY'RE BETTER DRESSERS. BETTER SINGERS. AND ONE OTHER THING.
THEY CAN'T STAND THAT A BLACK MAN, MUCH BLACKER THAN OBAMA, AND A REAL AMERICAN BLACK, IS THIS RIGHT WINGER.
THEIR BLACKS ARE JUST BLACKER. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S A SMOOTHER, DARKER TONE. IT'S CREAMIER, LIKE SUEDE.
YEAH, RIGHT, WHERE THE LEFT BRACK, THEY'RE, LIKE, PLETHER. ( LAUGHTER ).
IT'S ALSO ACTUALLY WHAT'S INSIDE IN A PARTY THAT REPRESENTS THEIR INTEREST. REPUBLICAN BLACKS, THEY DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO FLY CONFEDERATE DISPLAGZ RESTRICT  VOTING RIGHTS. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH CHARACTER THAT BUILDS?
I'M SORRY, ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT TO BUTT IN HERE.
Jon:  YES, SAM BEE.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NUMBERS. CONSERVATIVES HAVE SO FEW BLACKS. THEY CAN SPEND MORE TIME GROOMING THEM, POLISHING THEM LIKE CHUNKS OF RAW ONYX.
Jon:  I SEE.
IF DEMOCRATS WERE MORE DISCRIMINATING THEY'D HAVE TOP-QUALITY BLACKS, TOO.
Jon:  UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
LOOK, WE ALL AGREES THAT CONSERVATIVES JUST HAVE THE BETTER BLACKS ABSOLUTELY GLUE I  DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT.
WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE BLACK?
FOR ME, DEFINITELY HERMAIN CAIN.
OH, HE'S A GREAT BLACK!
COME ON, A BLACK PIZZA MOGUL. IT'S LIKE BITING DOWN ON A SLICE OF JAZZ. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  YOU BE KNOW YOU'RE MAKING SWEEPING GENERALIZATIONS  ABOUT WHOSE BLACKS ARE BETTER--
YOU'RE SO RIGHT, JON. WE HAVE TO COMPARE ALL THE MINORITIES.
OH, LIGHTNING ROUND! SO, JIM, GO.
WE HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THE REPUBLICANS. ERIC CANTOR, THE CHOSEN OF THE CHOSEN PEOPLE.
I AGREE. I DO AGREE WITH THAT. BUT ONLY UNTIL LIEBERMAN PICKS A SIDE. ( LAUGHTER ) HISPANIC.
OOH, DO FICTIONAL PRESIDENTS COUNT?
NO, AFRAID NOT.
OH, THERE GOES MARTIN SHEEN AND JIMMY SMITS FOR THE DEMS.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO MARCO RUBIO. DISW THE JOB-- DOES THE JOB OTHER LATINOS DO NOT WANT TO DO.
Jon:  I HOPE MR. TRUMP IS NOT WATCHING.
HOW ABOUT WOMEN. WOMEN HAD THE FIRST FEMALE V.P. CANDIDATE, THE FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE--
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? CONSERVATIVE WOMEN ARE SO MUCH BETTER, SHARP TONGUED, MEAN SPIRITED, STRINGING BLOND HAIR  AND THEIR BONE ARMS AND LEGS. THEY'RE LIKE SUPER-SEXY POLITICAL TARANTULAS.
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS WRITING THOSE BOOKS. THAT'S A GREAT USE OF TIME THEY DON'T SPEND IN LOVING RELATIONSHIPS.
THAT'S TRUE.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, SAM
