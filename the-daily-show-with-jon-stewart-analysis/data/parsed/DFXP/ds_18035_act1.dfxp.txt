FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. BISHOP GENE ROBINSON IS GOING TO  BE HERE A ALL I KNOW ABOUT  RELIGION IS THIS: APPARENTLY HE CAN ONLY MOVE DIAGONALLY. THAT'S A CHESS MOVE, BABY. A BISHOP CHESS JOKE. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU MY LUNCH  MONEY NOW. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE WORLD  OF SPORT. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HERE  KNOWS THIS. I HAPPEN TO ENJOY SPORT. I LIKE WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE  TALK ABOUT THEM. I LIKE LISTENING TO PEOPLE ON  THE RADIO CALL IN TO TALK ABOUT  SPORTS. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH THAT  KNOWLEDGE? I MAKE CAN'T-MISS BETS. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH MY  WINNINGS? YOU THINK I DO NICE THINGS WITH  THEM FOR SOCIETY? NO. I SPEND ALL MY GAMBLING WINNINGS  ON THE FIRST COMMERCIAL I SEE  AFTER A GAME ENDS. HELLO, BROOKLYN LANTERN. LOOKS LIKE SOME PEOPLE WON'T  HAVE TO EAT PASTA AGAIN WITH A  FLASHLIGHT. NO! BY THE WAY I DO WANT TO TELL  THAT WOMAN YOU COULD HAVE JUST  SOMEBODY HOLD THE FLASHLIGHT. THEN YOU COULD HOLD IT FOR  SOMEBODY. BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU'RE REALLY  FRUSTRATED. THE SPORTS WORLD HAS SUFFERED  TRAGIC OFF THE FIELD INCIDENTS. THE DALLAS COW BUOYS LOST A  PLAYER IN A DRUNK DRIVING  ACCIDENT AND THE MURDER-SUICIDE A WEEK BEFORE. THAT LED TO SPORTS COMMENTATOR  BOB COSTAS COMMENTATING ON THIS  AT HALF TIME
YOU WANT ACTUAL PERSPECTIVE  ON THIS? A BIT OF IT COMES FROM THE  KANSAS CITY BASED WRITER JASON  WHITTLOCK FROM THE END OF HIS  ARTICLE. "OUR CURRENT GUN CONTROL ENSURES  THAT MORE AND MORE DOMESTIC  DISPUTES WILL END IN THE ULTIMATE TRAGEDY. IN THE COMING DAYS JAVAN  BELCHER'S ACTIONS AND THEIR  POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO FOOTBALL WILL BE ANALYZED. WHO KNOWS? BUT HERE IS WHAT I BELIEVE. IF JAVAN BELCHER DIDN'T POSSESS  A GUN, HE AND CASSANDRA PERKINS  WOULD BOTH BE ALIVE TODAY SNIEM AND NOW THE MARCHING BAND. ALL RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TRAGEDY. IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO START  ADDRESSING ISSUES YOU HAVE TO  TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC ABUSE, MENTAL ILLNESS, THE HEAD TRAUMA,  THE FOOTBALL AND THE DRUGS THEY  GIVE THE GUYS FOR PAIN. I'M ASSUMING THAT COSTAS IS  LEAVING TO THAT CLEATUS, THE FOX  ROBOT. STILL HE WAS TRYING TO START A  CONVERSATION. HE SUCCEEDED.
THAT BELONGED ON NBC CABLE  CHANNEL. THEN YOU EXPECT THAT OVER THERE. YOU DON'T EXPECT THAT DURING A  FOOTBALL GAME
IT'S NFL SUNDAY. IT'S HALF TIME. GOD BLESS AMERICA IS PLAYING IN  THE BACKGROUND. DO I REALLY WANT BOB COSTAS  GIVING ME A DISSERTATION ON THE  SECOND AMENDMENT? I WANT TO WATCH FOOTBALL
Jon: REALLY? THAT'S WHEN I GO TAKE A PISS. BUT OKAY. YES AN NFL HALF TIME SHOW IS NO  TIME TO TALK ABOUT VIOLENCE IN  THE NFL. IT'S A TIME TO WATCH ENDLESS  SLOW-MOTION REPLAYS OF THAT  TODAY'S HARDEST HITS. THAT WAS A GREAT HIT. YEAH, I THINK THE GUY'S BRAIN  CAME OUT OF HIS EAR HOLE ON THAT  ONE. SUCKING IT UP LIKE A MAN. OF COURSE HE'LL NEVER BE THE  SAME AGAIN. HALF TIME ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME. WHAT ABOUT AT A PRESS  CONFERENCE? WHAT ABOUT AT A PRESS CONFERENCE  LIKE AFTER THE AURORA SHOOTING S  WHEN THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CALLED FOR AN EXAMINATION OF GUN  LAWS?
THE BODY IS NOT EVEN OUT OF  THE THEATER BEFORE HE STARTED TO  JUMP INTO THIS DEBATE. I THINK THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF  POLITICAL PROTOCOL THAT YOU NEED  TO HAVE IN A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS WHERE YOU WAIT. BE QUIET FOR 24 HOURS AT LEAST.
Jon: THAT'S CLEARLY IN THAT  SITUATION IT'S NOT WHERE IT IS  BEING DISCUSSED BUT WHEN. I'M ASSUMING THAT THE VENUE WAS  GOOD. IT'S JUST THAT THE MAYOR DID NOT  OBEY THE COMMON SENSE WAITING  PERIOD WE PLACE ON GUN... AMMMM... CONVERSATIONS. YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY IN AN  EMOTIONAL STATE JUST SHOOTING  OFF THEIR MOUTHS ABOUT GUNS. IT'S NOT JUST THE WHERE AND THE  WHEN OF THE CONVERSATION ABOUT  GUNS. IT'S THE WHO
IS THIS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT  TO HEAR AT HALF TIME? SPORTSCASTER BOB COSTAS  LECTURING FOOTBALL FANS -- THAT  MEANS YOU -- ABOUT GUN CONTROL?
MR. COSTAS, YOU DON'T KNOW  THAT MUCH ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT. STICK TO THE AREA THAT YOU'RE  REALLY SMART ABOUT WHICH IS  SPORTS. I WROTE A BOOK CALLED SHUT UP  AND SING. THIS WOULD BE SHUT UP AND  COMMENT ON SPORTS. WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT BOB  COSTAS THINKS ABOUT GUNS
Jon: BUT WHY DO YOU GET TO  TALK? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NO DISRESPECT, I DON'T MUCH CARE  WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT  ANYTHING. YET WHENEVER I TURN ON THE TV,  YOU'RE THERE TALKING ABOUT  EVERYTHING. THAT'S A SUBJECT OF MY BOOK:  SHUT UP AND SHUT UP. SO CLEARLY... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THAT ONE WAS EASY. CLEARLY SPORTS COMMENTATORS THEY  DON'T GET TO COMMENT ABOUT GUN  VIOLENCE AND SINGERS DON'T GET TO COMMENT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE  EITHER. RIGHT, BOB?
TED NUGENT ISSUED A QUOTE  SAYING WE THOUGHT BOB COSTAS WAS  SMARTER THAN THAT. ONLY FOOLS BLAME TOOLS INSTEAD  OF HUMAN FAILINGS.
Jon: HOW COME THAT GUY  DOESN'T HAVE TO SHUT UP AND  SING? OR SHUT UP AND WHATEVER IT IS  THAT HE DOES. I'M BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT THE  RULES THOUGH. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GHOUL  VIOLENCE, GUN CULTURE, GUN  CONTROL YOU HAVE TO BE A GUN EXPERT NOT JUST A SPORTS CAST OR  AMUSE I CANNIAN. EVEN THE RIGHT PERSON CAN'T TALK  ABOUT IT TOO SOON AFTER A  TRAGEDY. DISRESPECTFUL. HOW LONG DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO  SAY THERE SHOULD BE MORE GUNS  AFTER A TRAGEDY? LIKE THE SHOOTING IN OSLO.
YOU HAVE 600 PEOPLE THERE ON  THAT ISLAND, AND THE SECURITY  PROCEDURES THAT WERE THERE WERE NOT NONEFFECTIVE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GUN, YOU  DON'T HAVE SECURITY. I HAVE A BIG LAUGH WHEN THEY ASK  ME FOR SECURITY GUARDS BUT WE  DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE A GUN. IF YOU DON'T HAVE SECURITY WITH  A GUN THEN YOU'RE NOT HAVING  SECURITY.
Jon: THAT'S THE THING ABOUT  THESE NORWEGIANS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH  YOU NEED GUNS. IT'S A HARPOON CULTURE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M  SAYING? THEY SHOOT WHALES. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT [BLEEP]. THAT WAS ABOUT THE MASS KILLING  IN NORWAY. BUT AT LEAST THEY RESPECTFULLY  WAITED UNTIL 48 HOURS  AFTERWARDS. IN FACT, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A  CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR GUN  CULTURE, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE YOU'RE BEING TASTEFUL IN  RESPECTING THE VICTIMS AND THEIR  FAMILIES. OF COURSE IF YOU'RE TRYING NOT  TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION...
THIS GUY IS SIX-FOUR, 320, HE  COULD HAVE KILLED HER WITH HIS  BARE HANDS
BELCHER KILLED HER  I GUESS COSTAS DOES NOT THINK  BELCHER IS STRONG ENOUGH TO ASPHYXIATE HIS GIRLFRIEND OR  SMART ENOUGH TO HOOK UP A HOSE  INTO HIS GARAGE AND KILL HER THROUGH ASPHYXIATION
LOOK AT O.J. SIMPSON. HE WENT OVER THERE WITH A KNIFE. MURDERED HIS EX-WIFE AND HER  FRIEND.
WAS SHE KILLED WITH A GUN OR  WITH A KNIFE?
Jon: YEAH. KNIFE, KNIFE, KNIFE, KNIFE! NICOLE SIMPSON WAS MURDERED WITH  A KNIFE. DOES COSTAS WANT TO BAN KNIVES  BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE TO CUT  STEAK WITH OUR GUN AND THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE. STI, I THINK I GET THE RULES  NOW. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE  RULES. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT GUNS JUST NOT  IN THE IMMEDIATE WAKE OF ANY  EVENT INVOLVING GUNS. WITH APPROXIMATELY 30  GUN-RELATED MURDERS DAILY IN THE  UNITED STATES WHEN WILL IT EVER BE THE RIGHT TIME TO TALK ABOUT  THE ISSUES?
A RARE MOMENT IN NEW YORK  CITY. POLICE SAY THERE WERE NO  REPORTED SLAYINGS, STABBINGS,  SHOOTINGORS OR KNIFINGS DURING A 36-HOUR PERIOD FROM SUNDAY NIGHT  UNTIL TUESDAY MORNING. SNIEM THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. WE MISSED OUR [BLEEP] WINDOW. WHY RUIN THE CELEBRATION? WE'LL BE RIGHT
