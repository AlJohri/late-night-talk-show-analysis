WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT A STAFF WRITER FOR  "THE NEW YORKER". HE IS ALSO A BEST SELLING  AUTHOR WHOSE NEW BOOK IS  CALLED THE UNWINDING, THE  INNER HISTORY OF THE NEW AMERICA, PLEASE WELCOME BACK  TO THE PROGRAM GEORGE PACKER. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH  FOR JOINING US AGAIN. I SAY THIS BY GEORGE, YOU'VE  DONE IT AGAIN. THE UNWINDING, WHAT'S SO  CENTRING, I THINK, ABOUT THE  BOOK NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE GREAT STORIES BUT THE WAY  THAT YOU TELL THEM, YOU SORT  OF FOLLOW OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS, A CAST OF CHARACTERS  THAT WE GET TO KNOW. IT'S A NONFICTION BOOK THAT  READS LIKE A DOCUMENTARY  FILM IN SOME REGARD. YOU FOLLOW IT WITH AN ALMOST  DOCUMENTARY DRAMATIC  STRUCTURE.
I WANTED TO CREATE A  PORTRAIT OF AMERICA WHICH  WAS A KIND OF AMBITIOUS THING TO DO.
OVER THE COURSE OF 30  YEARS, A GENERATION. OUR ADULT LIFETIME, YOURS  AND MINE. AND TO DO THAT I FELT I HAD  TO HAVE BOTH A RANGE OF  PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, FROM CENTERS  OF POWER LIKE WASHINGTON,  WALL STREET, SILICON VALLEY BUT ALSO PEOPLE FROM THE  FORGOTTEN PLACES LIKE  THERE'S A WOMAN FROM  YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO, IN THIS BOOK, FROM RURAL NORTH  CAROLINA, THE-- AREAS OF  TAMPA ARE IN THE BOOK. AND THE STORY FOLLOWS THEM  ALL OVER THE COURSE OF THE  DECADE AS INSTITUTIONS START TO FAIL. AND GOVERNMENT FAIL, THE  BANK FAIL, ITS MEDIA FAILS  THEM. UNTIL THEY ARE SORT OF LEFT  ON THEIR OWN TO FIGURE OUT  THEIR OWN WAY THROUGH LIFE. AND EACH CHARACTER IN THE  BOOK HAS TO SORT OF REINVENT  HIM OR HERSELF IN ORDER TO KEEP GOING, TO SURVIVE.
Jon: I WOULD SAY THE  HUMAN SPIRIT COMES THROUGH  RELATIVELY WELL. HUMAN INSTITUTIONS DO LESS  WELL IN THE BOOK. THE QUO ROAD-- COROADING OF  THOSE, AND THE IMPACT THAT  HAS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES.
YEAH THERE IS A REAL  CONTRAST BETWEEN THE  INSTITUTIONS THAT WHILE I  WAS GROWING UP, COUNTED ON WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT. LIKE POLITICAL PARTIES WERE  THESE BORING THINGS THAT  WERE THERE AND PROVIDED SOME  STUFF. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, BANKS,  IT WASN'T THIS THING THAT  CREATED HEART ATTACKS AND CALAMITIES EVERY FIVE OR TEN  YEARS. AND OVER THE COURSE OF THIS  GENERATION ALL THAT BEGAN TO  CHANGE. THESE INSTITUTIONS STARTED  TO FALL APART. AND IT MEANT THAT THE  INDIVIDUAL SORT OF LEFT TO  FIGURE OUT THEIR OWN SUCCESS  AND SURVIVAL ON THEIR OWN. AND THAT'S WHAT THE  CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK HAVE  TO DO.
Jon: IF YOU WROTE THIS  BOOK ABOUT THE GENERATION  PREVIOUS TO OURS, COULD IT HAVE A SIMILAR, YOU KNOW T  DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A NOSTALGIC  BOOK. IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A, THIS  COUNTRY USED TO BE GREAT. IT TOOK CARE OF ITS PEOPLE. I IMAGINE IF YOU FOLLOWED A  SIMILAR GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER  A SIMILAR STRETCH OF TIME FROM 1930 TOSS 1960 YOU  MIGHT FIND A VERY SIMILAR  STORY.
I THINK THE INSTITUTIONS  WERE HEALTHIER IN THAT  PERIOD. BUT I THINK FOR-- .
Jon: FOR CERTAIN  POPULATIONS. BUT IN OTHER WORDS, THE  INSTITUTIONS WERE  RESTRICTIVE.
I WAS GOING SAY FOR  EXAMPLE TAMMY THOMAS A BLACK  PERSON FROM YOUNGSTOWN, ONE OF THE TWO MANY CHARACTERS  IN THE BOOK FROM 19230 TO  1970 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NONPERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. SO IN SOME WAYS THE COUNTRY  OPENED UP AND GRANTED MORE  FREEDOM TO MORE PEOPLE THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE. AND FREEDOM IS THE UPSIDE TO  THIS PAST GENERATION. WE NOW HAVE MILLIONS OF  CHOICES OF WHAT WE WATCH AND  WHAT WE EAT AND WHAT WE DO. SECURITY IS WHAT HAS BEEN  LOST. SO THE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS  THAT WERE THE MAINSTAY OF  YOUNGS TOWN, STEEL MILLS,  HAS COLLAPSED IN THE LATE  70s. AND TAMMY'S STORY IS ABOUT A  WOMAN TRYING TO SUR VOIF AND  KEEP HER KIDS GOING AND FIND A JOB THAT WILL LAST, GETS A  JOB IN AN AUTO PARTS  FACTORY. THINK SHE WILL RETIRE THERE  AT THE LAST MINUTE RIGHT  BEFORE HER RETIREMENT, THE COMPANY DECLARES A KIND OF  STRATEGIC BANKRUPTCY IN  ORDER TO GET OUT OF ITS  CONTRACTS AND SEND THE JOBS OVERSEAS WHICH IS A VERY  COMMON STORY. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE UP  AGAINST. SHE THEN BECOMES A COMMUNITY  ORGANIZER IN TIME FOR BARACK  OBAMA'S FIRST RUN FOR  PRESIDENT. AND IT IS KIND OF AN  INSPIRING STORY.
Jon: THE INSTITUTION OF  WASHINGTON IN FINANCE I  THINK COME OFF FOR THE MOST MOST-- NOT ABUSE BECAUSE  IT'S NOT A-- IN ANY WAY,  IT'S JUST AS THE STORY IS  TOLD, IT'S KIND OF, YOU SEE ITS ROUGH AS IT BEGINS TO  FORM IN GOVERNMENT AND IN  FINANCE.
AND TO TELL THE STORY OF  THOSE INSTITUTIONS, I HAVE  ALSO CREATED THESE PORTRAITS OF CELEBRITY, FAMOUS PEOPLE  WHICH ARE KIND OF SPREAD  THROUGHOUT THE BOOK AS YOU FOLLOW THE LESS FAMOUS  CHARACTERS. WASHINGTON IS REPRESENTED BY  NEWT GINGRICH WHO I THINK  HISTORY WILL SAY DID MORE THAN MAYBE ANY OTHER PERSON  TO CREATE THE PRETTY MESSED  UP POLITICS.
THAT WE KNOW TODAY.
Jon: YOU HAVE A GENTLEMAN  JOE CO-- KONOTON WHO WORKS  WITH JOE BIDEN.
YES.
Jon: AND IS VERY  IDEALISTIC BECAUSE HE HEARS  HIM SPEAK IN 1979 IN  DELAWARE. THAT DOESN'T END WELL FOR  HIM AND IT CERTAINLY PUTS  VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN IN A  VERY DIFFICULT LIGHT.
WELL, IT'S A PORTRAIT OF  A WASHINGTON RELATIONSHIP  WHICH IS TO SAY A  TRANSACTION AM YOU DO THIS FOR ME, I'LL DO THIS FOR  YOU. AND AS SOON AS SOMEONE  CEASES TO BE USEFUL, THE  RELATIONSHIP KIND OF ENDS. SO JEFF KONOTON HAS ATTACHED  HIS DREAMS TO JOE BIDEN. HE THINKS OF HIM LIKE THE  KENNEDIES. BIDEN IS A LITTLE BIT MORE  INSTRUMENTAL ABOUT THE  RELATIONSHIP. AND IT ENDS UP BEING SORT OF  AN UNREQUIETED AMBITION OF  KONOTON. HE THEN BECOMES A LOBBYIST  BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT NOT  ONLY CAN YOU MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY WILL BEEEING THAN  WORKING GOVERNMENT BUT YOU  CAN ALSO ACTUALLY DO BETTER. YOU CAN SUCCEED IN A WAY AS  A JUNIOR-- .
Jon: YOU COULD AFFECT  MORE CHANGE BUT I THINK THAT  WAS FOR ME-- THERE ARE MANY HEARTBREAKING ASPECTS TO  THIS AND MANY THAT ARE  INSPIRING. THAT IS A PRETTY  HEARTBREAKING EPISODE.
BECAUSE HE BECOMES A  LOBBYIST, MAKES A TON OF  MONEY IN A VERY SUCCESSFUL FIRM AND THEN THE FINANCIAL  CRISIS HITS AND ALL THE  CHARACTERS LIVES ARE SORT OF CONVERGING ON 2008. AND THAT'S THE BIG UPHEAVAL  AND DRAMA THAT CHANGES  EVERYBODY'S COURSE. JEFF KONOTON GOES BACK INTO  GOVERNMENT BECAUSE HIS OLD  FRIEND TED KAUFMAN TAKES BIDEN'S SEAT. AND THEIR WHOLE AMBITION IS  TO MAKE WALL STREET PAY. AND THEY TRY.
Jon: DONE TELL ME HOW IT  TURNS OUT. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I BET AT THE DON'T GET AWAY  WITH IT. STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE  BIT THOUGH, OKAY.
SURE.
Jon: IT IS BEAUTIFUL  STORYTELLING. IT IS LIKE STUD TURKLEY BUT  WITH A KEN BURNS. THE UNWINDING, ON THE BOOK  SHELVES MAY 21st. GEORGE PACKER, EVERYBODY.
