Jon: HERE WE GO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S A FORMER  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, WAS THE  FIRST WOMAN TO SERVE ON OUR SUPREME COURT. THE NEW BOOK IS CALLED OUT OF  ORDER, STORIES FROM THE HISTORY  OF THE SUPREME COURT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM JUSTICE SANDRA DAY  O'CONNOR. NICE TO SEE YOU.
GLAD TO BE HERE.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED  "OUT OF ORDER."  WHAT WAS YOUR PURPOSE IN THIS  BOOK, IN PUTTING THIS PARTICULAR BOOK TOGETHER?
TELLING THE STORIES ABOUT HOW  THE COURT WORKS AND GIVING  PEOPLE A GLIMPSE INTO SOME OF THE THINGS.
Jon: IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE  THE PRESSURE THAT A JUSTICE  MIGHT FEEL WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER  SOME OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES OF  OUR DAY.
YES.
Jon: OF RACISM AND  DISCRIMINATION AND THE  FRANCHISE.
RIGHT.
Jon: DOES THAT WEIGHT -- DO  YOU FEEL THAT WHEN YOU ARE  DECIDING THOSE CASES?
YOU CERTAINLY DO BECAUSE YOU  REALLY WANT TO MAKE THE CORRECT  DECISION AND BRING SOME ORDER OUT OF OUR VARIOUS STATUTES AND  CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND  THE PRIS PRECEDENCE OF THE COURT  ITSELF. IT'S HARD SOMETIMES.
Jon: YOU WROTE BROWN VERSUS  BOARD OF EDUCATION MAY BE THE  MOST IMPORTANT DECISION.
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US  AS A NATION.
Jon: WHEN THEY MADE THAT  DECISION WAS IT A DIFFICULT  SPHWHUN DO PEOPLE FEEL THEY OVERREACHED AT THAT TIME? DO YOU KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW THE FEELING OF  THE JUSTICES BUT IT WAS A MAJOR  DECISION. AND MANY THEM ARE -- THEY EFFECT  US FOR YEARS TO COME AND YOU  REALLY WANT TO GET IT PROPERLY  DECIDED.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE ONE YOU  WANTED BACK THAT YOU PUT OUT  THERE AND YOU WERE LIKE, THAT WAS A ROUGH ONE?
IF I DID, I WOULDN'T SAY.
Jon: COME ON, JUSTICE! GET IN THERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DO YOU EVER FEEL AS SOME OF  THESE CASES ARE COMING UP TO  THIS COURT OH, I'D LIKE TO JUMP IN THERE AND -- GET YOU LIKE AN  OLD BALL PLAYER.
I'VE NOT HAD THAT FEELING. WHEN THEY HAVE A TERRIBLY  DIFFICULT DECISION I USUALLY SAY  TO MYSELF THANK GOODNESS I DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE DECIDING IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HAVE YOU MET ALL THE  NEW JUSTICES.
YES, OF COURSE.
Jon: ARE THERE BUFFETS? I DON'T KNOW HOW THE -- IS THERE  A JUSTICES BRUNCH?
YES. IT'S COMMON FOR ALL OF THE  JUSTICES TO GET TOGETHER AND EAT  LUNCH TOGETHER. PHYSICAL THEY ARE THERE WE GO  HAVE -- IF THEY ARE THERE WE GO  HAVE LUNCH IN THE JUSTICES DINING ROOM. SEND UP FROM THE CAFETERIA WHAT  WE WANT TO EAT.
Jon: THE CAFETERIA?
YES WE ORDER FROM THE  CAFETERIA.
Jon: I FEEL LIKE CHINESE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU COULD  HAVE IT SENT IN FROM THE COURT  BUT YOU WOULDN'T GET IT FROM THE  CAFETERIA.
Jon: HOW HARD IS IT TO GET  CONSENSUS ON THE ORDER FOR  LUNCH?
NO BECAUSE YOU JUST -- [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE JUST ORDERING FOR  YOURSELF SO IT'S PRETTY EASY.
Jon: THERE WAS NEVER ANY  POWER IN BEING THE SWING JUSTICE  FOR --
LUNCH, NO.
Jon: LET'S SAY IF A  HEAVES -- FAJITAS.
NO.
Jon: VERY INTERESTING. DO YOU FEEL THAT THESE -- THIS  VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS HARD FOR ME  TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, THAT IT WOULD EVEN BE CHALLENGED. IT SEEMS TO HAVE DONE SO MUCH  GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, SO MUCH  GOOD FOR VOTERS THAT HAVE BEEN  DISENFRANCHISED. I'M HAVING TROUBLE WRAPPING MY  HEAD AROUND WHY IT WOULD BE  CHALLENGED IN THAT REGARD.
I DON'T THINK THE WHOLE  CONCEPT WAS CHALLENGED. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS CHALLENGED  FROM TIME TO TIME.
Jon: ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT  THAT ONE THAT SAYS THE STATES  HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION TO CHANGE ANY OF OUR VOTING RULES?
WELL, THAT COULD BE ONE. I DON'T HAPPEN TO REMEMBER  TODAY.
Jon: DO YOU FOLLOW THE  COURT AT ALL?
I DO A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: A LITTLE BIT.
I READ ALL THE DECISIONS WHEN  THEY ARE HANDED DOWN THESE DAYS.
Jon: REALLY? WHO DO YOU FIND TO BE THE BEST  WRITER ON THE COURT.
OH, MY. I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THAT  OPINION.
Jon: AH! WHY ARE THE JUSTICES SO TIGHT  LIPPED. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR WAS ON. SHE WOULDN'T SAY BECAUSE SHE HAS  TO FACE THESE GUYS. BUT YOU -- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S  SOMETHING VERY DEEP THAT PEOPLE  WHO SERVE ON THE COURT ARE  PROTECTING.
I THINK WE --
Jon: THERE'S A VEIL.
I THINK WE RESPECT THENCE  TUITION. WE SERVED ON IT, WE ADMIRE IT  AND WE DON'T WANT TO SO SOME  DAMAGE.
Jon: REALLY.
WE DON'T.
Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE  HE-OF-WE KNEW MORE ABOUT IT  WOULD WE RESPECT IT LESS OR  MORE?
I THINK MORE. YOU DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT  BECAUSE WE EXPLAIN IN DETAIL  EVERY DECISION.
Jon: YEAH, BUT THAT'S  READING.
YEAH, THAT'S READING.
Jon: AND IT'S VERY  COMPLICATED.
IT IS COMPLICATED.
Jon: IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY  COMPLICATED. HERE IS WHAT WE'LL DO. WE'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL AND YOU  CAN TELL ME THE GOOD THINGS --  THE THINGS THINGS ABOUT THOUGHT YOU FEEL ARE SO VITAL TO PROTECT. THAT WILL HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY  PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT FROM THE  COURT TO SPEAK.
OKAY.
Jon: VERY GOOD. WE'LL BE BACK WITH SUPREME COURT  JUSTICE SANDRA DAY
