(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A WRITER AND ACTRESS  ON NBC'S "THE OFFICE." HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "IS  EVERYONE HANGING OUT WITHOUT ME AND OTHER CONCERNS" PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, MINDY KALING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) NICE TO SEE YOU, MINDY KALING, LET ME SAY, WE'RE ALL HUGE FANS OF YOURS.
THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU YOU WERE GOING TO TAKE A PICTURE. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD, HAPPY HALLOWEEN.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW DO YOU PARTAKE IN HALLOWEEN FESTIVITIES?
WELL... BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO COME ON HALLOWEEN, OUT  OF A THEATRICAL PERSONALITY SO I WAS GOING TO COME IN COSTUME. AND THEN MY FRIENDS WERE LIKE "THEN YOU'D BE IN COSTUME AND  IT'S BE FUNNY FOR A SECOND AND YOU'D BE SITTING IN YOUR BAT MAN COSTUME. "BUT I WANTED TO COME AS YOU. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FUNNY COSTUME.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING I'M BAT MAN!
(LAUGHS) I WAS GOING TO WEAR A SUIT AND EVERYTHING BUT I THOUGHT IF YOU  WERE JUST FLIPPING THROUGH THE CHANNELS YOU'D BE LIKE "OH, SANJAY GUPTA IS ON "THE DAILY SHOW"! I LOVE HIM!" THEN I WOULD BE LIKE "MY BOOK!"  AND YOU'D BE LIKE "SAN JA GUPTA WON'T STOP. WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? HE WENT TO HAITI." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU THIS: DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING SOMETIMES AND I FOLLOW IT. DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.
I DON'T SEE IT COMING. IT'S JUST INSPIRATION. >>.
Jon: EXACTLY. IT JUST HAPPENS. GUPTA WOULD BE LUCKY FOR ANYONE TO HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK LIKE THIS.
DOES ANYONE CALL YOU BY HIS LAST NAME EXCEPT FOR YOU? YOU'RE THAT FAMILIAR WITH HIM?
I LIKE TO INTIMIDATE HIM. "WHAT'S UP, GUPTA?" (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE THEN I FEEL LIKE NOW... AND HE PROBABLY CALLS ME... SOMETHING. HE WAS ON THIS PROGRAM NOT... WOULDN'T YOU SAY WHEN YOU WATCH HIM ON TELEVISION HE'S LIKE 6'.
YES.
Jon: NO. (LAUGHTER)
HE ISN'T?
NO. YOU WANT KNOW TELL YOU?
HOW TALL?
Jon: NINE INCHES TALL. I HAVE HIM RIGHT HERE. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S SO KNOWLEDGEABLE.
Jon: HE'S LIKE A BRAIN SURGEON.
HE IS.
Jon: DOING, LIKE, FIVE-MINUTE SPOTS ON NEW BAGS OR SOMETHING. HE SHOULD BE OPERATING ON BRAINS.
I THINK MAYBE BECAUSE I'M INDIAN, BUT INDIAN PARENTS... MY  PARENTS LOVE SANJAY GUPTA AND THEY ALWAYS SAY "AND HE'S HANDSOME."  AS THOUGH THAT WAS SOMETHING HE WORKED ON OR SOMETHING. THEY LOVE THAT.
Jon: ARE THEY TRYING TO EGG YOU ON? ARE THEY TRYING TO SAY TO YOU "HE'S VERY BRIGHT AND HANDSOME. MINDY..." (LAUGHTER) LIKE, IS THAT A... AN ATTEMPT TO MATCH MAKE IN SOME RESPECTS?
I THINK THAT IN... OUR WORLDS ARE SO DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF WHAT I DO BUT, YES, I THINK IN  SOME... YEARS AGO I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL THING. WHO WOULDN'T? YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE INDIAN TO WANT YOUR KID TO MARRY SANJAY GUPTA, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HE OPERATES ON BRAINS! AND OVERCAME BEING NINE INCHES TALL. (LAUGHTER) TO CLIMB UP AND OPERATE ON BRAINS.
SPEAKING OF MY PARENTS, THEY WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ME COMING ON THE SHOW.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YES, MY PARENTS LOVE FOX NEWS OKAY? HUGE FOX NEWS FANS. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: HER PARENTS ARE LOVELY PEOPLE! A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCH THAT.
THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE. THEIR FRAME OF REFERENCE ABOUT WHO YOU ARE IS VERY DIFFERENT. BECAUSE FOR THEM YOU'RE THE TROUBLE MAKER WHO APPEARS ON THEIR FAVORITE PROGRAMS. (LAUGHTER) I'M GOING ON JON STEWART AND THEY GO "OH, THE ONE WHO GOES ON BILL O RILELY. " SO THEY THINK YOU'RE SMART BUT... YOU'VE OUTCLASSED THEIR  FAVORITE PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN SHOWS.
Jon: DO THEY EVER SAY LIKE AFTER THAT "AND HANDSOME, TOO?" (LAUGHTER)  DO THEY GO WITH THAT OR NO? THEY DON'T... THEY DON'T IN ANY... IT'S OKAY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE THEY DID. BUT IF I SAID IT NOW YOU WOULD THINK I WAS MAKING IT UP.
Jon: NO, YOU CAN SAY IT NOW.
MY MOTHER HAS SAID THAT.
Jon: ARE THEY OKAY WITH... MY PARENTS TOOK A LONG TIME FOR  THEM... I DIDN'T HAVE TO MARRY A JEWISH GIRL. AT A CERTAIN POINT ONCE I HIT 35 THEY WERE LIKE "JUST MARRY."  WHERE'S YOUR... ARE THEY AT THAT WITH YOU? DO THEY CARE? DOES IT MATTER?
MY PARENTS ARE... MY MOM IS PRETTY EMANCIPATED. SHE'S MODERN. SHE DOESN'T EVEN THINK I NEED TO GET MARRIED.
Jon: WHICH YOU DON'T.
I HEARD AN EXCITED SASSY WHAT
Jon: VAGINA!
THAT ILL LIS TED THE BIGGEST ROUND OF APPLAUSE EVER.
Jon: IT'S AN INTERESTING CROWD.
BUT YOU KNOW THEY WOULD LOVE A GIANT WEDDING. BUT IT'S NOT... IT'S NOT A HUGE BIG DEAL. AS LONG AS THE PERSON'S NOT LIKE CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AND.
Jon: THAT'S THEIR ONE STEP ADMINISTRATION?
OR A GAMBLER. FOR SOME REASON MY MOM HAS SAID "STAY AWAY FROM A GAMBLER."  I DON'T KNOW ANY GAMBLERS. I KNOW THEY'RE DRAMATIZED ON TELEVISION AND FILM BUT SHE HAS  A FEELING I'M GOING TO RUN INTO GAMBLERS.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT A PRANK YOU PULL ON HER. HAVE A GUY SHOW UP WITH A HAT AND A GOLD RING AND BE LIKE WHERE DID YOU HEAT HIM? VEGAS. YOU HAVE TO GET THE BOOK, IT'S HILARIOUS. YOUR MUSINGS, YOUR LIFE. EXCELLENT BOOK. REALLY ENJOYED IT AND I LOVE SEEING YOU ON THE SHOW. IS EVERYONE HANGING OUT WITHOUT SHE ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MINUTE DAY KALING, EVERYBODY.
