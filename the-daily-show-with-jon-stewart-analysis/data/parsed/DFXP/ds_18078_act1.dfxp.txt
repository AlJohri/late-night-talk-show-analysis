CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME  TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. VERY FUNNY AUTHOR MARY ROACH  WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. FIRST I WANT TO TALK TO YOU  ABOUT SPRING. IT'S FINALLY HERE. THE FIRST ROBIN. THE EASTER BUNNY DELIVERING TO  CHILDREN THE UNHOLY TINTED SPAWN  OF A CHICKEN AND ITS CHOCOLATE BAR LOVER. THE METS UNDEFEATED IN FIRST  PLACE BUT ENOUGH ABOUT OUR  SPRING. HOW ABOUT THE ARAB SPRING. THE FLOURISHING OF DEMOCRACY IN  THE MIDDLE EAST. COUNTRIES FORMERLY RUN BY  DICTATORSHIPS, U.S. MOSTLY  SUPPORTED, HEY, JUST OUT OF  CURIOSITY. HOW ARE THINGS GOING TODAY IN, I  DON'T KNOW, EGYPT
UNEMPLOYMENT AT 13%. INFLATION IS ALMOST DOUBLED  SINCE NOVEMBER.
CAIRO'S AGING INFRASTRUCTURE  GOES UNTENDED
THANKS TO THE REVOLUTION,  WE'VE TEEN TOURISM DROP ANNUALLY  ABOUT $4 BILLION
THE HUGE SPIKE IN SEXUAL  ASSAULTS AGAINST WOMEN
Jon: OKAY. I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR A WORK IN  PROGRESS. WOW. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT SOUNDS  LIKE THIS NEW EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT  MOHAMMED MORSI HAS GOT HIS HANDS  FULL. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW HE TACKLES  THESE COMPLEX AND URGENT ISSUE
THE PROSECUTORS HAVE ORDERED  THE ARREST OF POPULAR TELEVISION  PRODUCER BASSEM YOUSEF
Jon: WHO IS THAT GUY? HAS HE BEEN SABOTAGING  INFRASTRUCTURE OR HARASSING  EGYPTIAN WOMEN ON THE STREET OR UNEMPLOYING EGYPTIAN. WHAT DOES HE DO
HE USES A TV SHOW KNOWN FOR  POKING FUN AT THE PRESIDENT. BASSEM HOSTS A TV SHOW KNOWN FOR  POKING FUN AT THE PRESIDENT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WAIT A MINUTE. BASSEM YOUSEF? THE COMEDIAN? WHO HOSTS THE INCREDIBLY POPULAR  WEEKLY POLITICAL SATIRE SHOW? NOW I KNOW BASSEM PRETTY WELL. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT I WAS  SHOCKED THAT THIS WHOLE TIME I  HAVE BEEN CONSORTING WITH A  CRIMINAL. WHAT DID HE DO? I'M READY, I'M READY
THE COUNTRY'S TOP PROSECUTOR  ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT  CHARGING THE COMEDIAN WITH INSULTING BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND  ISLAM.
Jon: THAT'S ILLEGAL? SERIOUSLY, THAT'S ILLEGAL IN  EGYPT BECAUSE IF INSULTING THE  PRESIDENT AND ISLAM WERE A JAILABLE OFFENSE HERE, FOX NEWS  GO BYE-BYE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   YEAH. BUT THEY DON'T GO BYE-BYE. YOU KNOW, I GUESS THE RULES ON  FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ARE A  LITTLE DIFFERENT IN EGYPT. OVER THERE, YOU CANNOT INSULT  RELIGION. I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT WOULD  SOMETHING LIKE INSULTING  RELIGION SOUND LIKE ANYWAY?
Jon: THAT'S INSULTING ALL  RIGHT. WOW. I'M SURE THAT WHEN PRESIDENT  MORSI HEARS ABOUT THAT, HE IS  GOING TO BE SO... I'M SORRY. THAT IS PRESIDENT MORSI? REALLY. HE DIDN'T BY ANY CHANCE PRECEDE  THOSE REMARKS WITH "HERE'S THE  SORT OF THING YOU SHOULDN'T SAY IN EGYPT" DID HE? NO. BY THE WAY IF YOU ARE GOING TO  NURSE YOUR CHILDREN ON ZIONIST  AND JEW HATRED, YOU REALLY GOT TO BREASTFEED. I MEAN IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO  ENSURE THAT YOUR KID GETS ALL  THE ANTI-SEMETIC NUTRIENTS THAT HE NEEDS. I GUESS IN A PINCH YOU COULD  ABOUT GERBER'S ELDERS OF ZION  FORMULA BUT IT'S A LESSER  PRODUCT. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT WAS PROBABLY A ONE-TIME  THING FOR MORSI. WE ALL LOSE OUR HEADS  OCCASIONALLY AND INSULT  RELIGION. EVEN IN EGYPT JUST ONCE, RIGHT? ONCE?
Jon: OKAY. TWO THINGS. ON THE DEFENDED FROM APES FRONT,  I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YOU. IT TURNS OUT THAT'S MORE COMMON  THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. AND AS FOR THE PIG THING, COME  ON! IF YOU'RE GOING TO INSULT THE  JEWS YOU CAN'T GO WITH A KOSHER  ANIMAL. YOUR GOAT? CLEARLY PRESIDENT MORSI KNOWS  HIS WAY AROUND THE GOOD  RELIGIOUS INSULT. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE BASSEM  MAY HAVE DONE HERE PERHAPS  CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
HE MOCKED HIM WHEN HE WAS  AWARDED AN HONORARY DEGREE IN  PAKISTAN AND TOOK AIM AT THE PRESIDENT'S LESS THAN FLUENT  ENGLISH.
Jon: MAKING FUN OF THE  PRESIDENT'S HAT AND LESS THAN  FLUENT ENGLISH -- THAT WAS MY ENTIRE CAREER FOR EIGHT YEARS. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THAT'S ALL I DID. I'M SORRY. YOU SHOULD HEAR WHAT WE SAY  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WE  SUPPOSEDLY LIKE. BARACK, YOU SMOKE SO MUCH YOUR  LUNGS ARE THE ONLY AUTHENTICALLY  BLACK THINGS ABOUT YOU. KIND OF REMINDS ME OF HIS  CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. YES, WE CAN. BUT SHOULD WE? WHAT HAPPENED TO BARRY FROM THE  BLOCK? HAVE WE BEEN FOOLED BY THE  BARACK THAT YOU GOT? ALL THAT POWER THAT YOU DIDN'T  LIKE WHEN SOMEONE ELSE HAD IT,  YOU DECIDED TO KEEP IT. OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE FRODO. ARREST ME. I DON'T GET THIS, MAN. YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT. THE INHERITOR OF ONE OF THE  GREATEST LANDS AND PEOPLE IN  RECORDED HISTORY. YOUR PEOPLE INVENTED  CIVILIZATION. THE ANCIENT GREEKS WENT TO EGYPT  AND WERE LIKE, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT  THERE GEOMETRY AND MYTHOLOGY? ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THOSE? COULD WE USE THOSE? THE EGYPTIANS INVENTED WRITTEN  LANGUAGE. AND PAPER. TOOTHPASTE. PEOPLE BEING BURIED WITH THEIR  CATS. THAT WAS YOU. A STYLE OF WALKING PEOPLE SING  ABOUT EVEN TODAY. EGYPT BUILT THE GREAT PYRAMIDS. MAYBE YOU COULD GET SOME OF THE  FOLKS WHO BUILT THOSE WHO WORK  ON GETTING YOU A THICKER SKIN. WELL NOT THE SAME PEOPLE. I OBVIOUSLY... I CAN'T HANDLE  TWO PASSOVERS. I CAN'T HANDLE IT. SO BASSEMOUS RECEIVE POKED FUN  OF YOUR HAT AND YOUR LACK OF  PROMISED DEMOCRATIC REFORMS. WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT? YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT. YOU HAVE AN ARMY. HE'S GOT PUNS IN A SHOW. YOU HAVE TANKS AND PLANES. WE SHOULD KNOW. WE STILL HAVE THE RECEIPTS. LOOK, SILENCING A COMEDIAN  DOESN'T QUALIFY YOU TO BE  PRESIDENT OF EGYPT. JUST PRESIDENT OF NBC. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. TALK ABOUT A ONCE PROUD EMPIRE. WHATEVER PROBLEMS YOU HAVE IN  EGYPT, AT LEAST YOU CAN'T DREAM  LIKE SMASH. LOOK, (LAUGHING) I'M SORRY. A COUPLE OF BLOGGERS JUST WENT  NUTS. WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY POWERFUL  YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PETTY. I KNOW. I'M PETTY ALL THE TIME. AND THE TRUTH IS... COME HERE. LET ME TALK TO YOU. COME HERE. WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT,  MR. PRESIDENT? THE POWER OF SATIRE TO OVER  THROW THE SADDEST CO. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS CRAP FOR 15  YEARS. GRANTED I'M NOT AS POPULAR AS  BASSEM BUT WE'VE HAD OUR NIGHTS. THERE'S BEEN A GRAND TOTAL OF  ZERO TOPPLED GOVERNMENTS WE'VE  BROUGHT ABOUT DURING THAT TIME. WE COULDN'T STOP THE IRAQ WAR. WE TRIED. I COULDN'T EVEN GET JIM KRAMER  OFF THE AIR. THE MONEY SHOW WHERE SOUND  EFFECTS GIVE YOU STOCK  INVESTMENT ADVICE. COME ON! CHARGING BASSEM WITH INSULTING  ISLAM AND EGYPT. THERE ARE TWO THINGS HE LOVED IN  THIS WORLD WITH ALL HIS HEART:  EGYPT AND ISLAM. AND HIS FAMILY. THREE THINGS. THERE'S THREE THINGS. AND WHAT IS THAT FLAT BREAD WITH  THE CHEESE THAT'S TART? IT'S LIKE A... IT'S NOT... THERE'S FOUR THINGS THAT HE  LIKES. MY POINT IS BASSEM LOVES EGYPT  SO MUCH HE CHOOSES TO LIVE THERE  EVEN THOUGH SOME CRAZY GUY IS THREATENING TO ARREST HIM. OH, RIGHT. BY THE WAY WITHOUT BASSEM AND  ALL THOSE JOURNALISTS AND  BLOGGERS AND BRAVE PROTESTORS WHO WOOK TO THE SQUARE TO VOICE  DISSENT YOU PRESIDENT MORSI  WOULD NOT BE IN A POSITION TO REPRESS THEM. FOR SOMEONE WHO SPENT TIME IN  JAIL YOURSELF...   ( APPLAUSE )   FOR SOMEONE WHO SPENT TIME IN  JAIL YOURSELF UNDER MUBARAK YOU  SEEM AWFULLY EAGER TO SEND OTHER PEOPLE THERE FOR THE SAME  NONCRIMES. JUST LIKE YOU THEY WILL ONLY  EMERGE FROM PRISON STRONGER AND  MORE DETERMINED. SO SENDING COMEDIANS AND  BLOGGERS TO PRISON ACCOMPLISHES  IS LOWERING THE QUALITY OF PRISON YARD ATHLETICS. OBVIOUSLY, LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE  TO TAKE DEMOCRACY ADVICE FROM AN  APE-PIG MAN LIKE MYSELF. BUT PERHAPS YOU'LL LISTEN TO  THIS BRAVE EGYPTIAN  REVOLUTIONARY.
WHOEVER CRITICIZES ME HAS THE  FULL RIGHT TO DO SO. I WELCOME ANY CRITICISM. I WELCOME EVERY OPINION. I WELCOME EVERY VIEW.
ELBARADEI THEY DON'T HAVE TO  WORRY ABOUT GOING TO JAIL?
THEY ARE EGYPTIANS. THEY ARE PART OF MY FAMILY FROM  EGYPT. THERE IS NO WAY THAT ANY HARM  CAN BEFALL THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR  OPINIONS OR THEIR PERSONAL  OPPOSITION.
Jon: NOW THAT'S THE KIND OF  OPEN DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT THAT A  GREAT NATION LIKE EGYPT  DESERVES. I'M GOING TO LET YOU KNOW A  LITTLE SECRET. THE WORLD IS WATCHING. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE EGYPT PLUNGE  INTO DARKNESS. DEMOCRACY ISN'T A DEMOCRACY IF  IT ONLY LASTS UP UNTIL SOMEONE  MAKES FUN OF YOUR HAT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
