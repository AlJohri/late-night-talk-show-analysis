WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A PHYSICS PROFESSOR AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, ALSO A BESTSELLING AUTHOR. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "KNOCKING ON HEAVEN'S DOOR: HOW PHYSICS AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING  ILLUMINATE THE UNIVERSE AND THE MODERN WORLD." PLEASE WELCOME LISA RANDALL. HELLO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE.
Jon: IT'S CALLED "KNOCKING ON HEAVEN'S DOOR: HOW PHYSIC AND  SCIENTIFIC THINKING ILLUMINATE THE UNIVERSE AND THE MODERN WORLD. PHYSICS AND SCIENCE ILLUMINATE THE UNIVERSE AND THE MODERN WORLD. WHY DO WE FIGHT SO HARD NOT TO BE ILLUMINATED BY IT?
THAT IS A REALLY GOOD YES, AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. I FIND IT SO FASCINATING AND EXCITING, BUT I GUESS PART OF THE REASON MIGHT BE THAT SOME OF  THE IDEAS ARE REMOVED FROM WHAT WE SEE IN OUR DAILY LIVES. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST INTUITIVE. SO WE HAVE TO GET OUTSIDE THE FRAME OF HUMAN SCALES OR HUMAN SIZES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT'S  REALLY GOING ON AT PLACES WHERE YOU ACTUALLY NEED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE MEASUREMENTS. BUT MY HOPE IS THAT IF PEOPLE LEARN MORE ABOUT IT OR ARE AWARE OF IT THEN THEY WON'T BE SO  AFRAID AND THEY WILL BE MORE INTERESTED.
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH IN THE FIRST PART, THERE'S A SENSE THAT  THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED, AND IT SOUNDS MADE UP. [LAUGHTER] SO YOU MUST BE MAKING IT UP AND THEN IT'S A VERY EASY THING TO SAY, AND THE REASON YOU'RE  MAKING IT UP IS BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING FOR THE DEMOCRATS. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW... I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT BECOMES A POLITICAL ISSUE. IT'S A VERY STRANGE LITTLE TURN THAT HAPPENS THERE.
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM I THINK IS THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T  ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE. WE'RE A LITTLE BIT AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE ITSELF. WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE. WHEN WE REPORT, THIS PERSON SAID THIS, THIS PERSON SAID THAT. AND THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AT THE ROOT OF IT. AND IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT SCIENCE ISN'T ALWAYS ENTIRELY PREDICTIVE AT 100% LEVEL. THAT'S PART OF THE NATURE OF SCIENCE. THAT'S WHY WE STILL HAVE RESEARCH. AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. AND BECAUSE WE SO MUCH WANT SCIENCE TO JUST SAY, THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS, WE SOMETIMES LOSE  THAT AND WE LOSE THE FACT THAT THIS UNCERTAINTY IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING. IT'S PLACE PEOPLE CAN THINK AND YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ASSUMPTION, UNDERSTAND THE  QUESTIONS PEOPLE ARE ASKING, SO YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD.
Jon: I ALWAYS FELT THAT THE MORE YOU LEARN FROM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, THE MORE MYSTERIOUS  AND INCREDIBLE THE UNIVERSE BECOMES. YOU KNOW, EVEN IF YOU LEARN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BIG BANG, WHAT A PARTICLE IS OR  WHATEVER OTHER THINGS YOU CLEARLY ARE MAKING UP, THAT DOESN'T DISCOUNT, THAT DOESN'T  EVER GET... I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE  KNOW EVERYTHING AND THEREFORE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR GOD OR FAITH OR ANYTHING. IS THAT... WHY ARE THEY INCOMPATIBLE?
WELL, OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, I ANOTHER SAY THE FACT THERE ARE ALL THESE QUESTIONS IS FANTASTIC. FIRST OF ALL, IT WOULD BE WEIRD IF WE LIVED AT THE ONE TIME WHERE WE SUDDENLY KNEW ALL THE ANSWERS. THAT'S WHAT GIVES US ROOM TO DO STUFF. BUT IN TERMS OF ROOM FOR GOD, PEOPLE CAN THINK WHATEVER THEY WANT. THERE'S ROOM FOR SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OR PSYCHOLOGICAL, BUT SCIENCE ACTUALLY TELLS US A VERY DEFINITE WAY OF MOVING FORWARD. IT DOESN'T SAY WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. IT SAYS THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW. THIS IS THE DEGREE OF PRECISION WITH WHICH WE KNOW IT, AND THIS IS HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD, AN  WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BY STUDYING THINGS THAT WE CAN TEST. WE CAN HAVE IDEAS. WE DON'T YET KNOW THE ANSWER. THAT WAS THE TITLE OF MY BOOK, "KNOCKING ON HEAVEN'S DOOR" WAS SUPPOSED TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT  WE DO KNOW A LOT, BUT THERE IS AN EDGE BEYOND IT THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO PRY OPEN. AND SO THIS IS WHAT SIGNS DOES. AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
DO YOU THINK THE CONFLUENCE OF SCIENCE AND THE INDIVIDUAL... HAS SCIENCE GOTTEN SO COMPLEX AND OUR KNOWLEDGE GOTTEN SO GREAT THAT WE STILL HAVE ROOM  FOR THINGS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE HAD WALTER ISAACSON STEVE JOBS, THIS GUY IN HIS GARAGE TOOK WHAT WAS THE FOREFRONT OF SEMICONDUCTOR SCIENCE AND COULD  STILL IN HIS GARAGE FASHION NEW AND INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT WOULD HELP YOU PLAY PONG. [LAUGHTER] ARE WE AT A POINT WHERE THAT STILL WILL BE ABLE TO... IS THERE A VANGUARD OF THAT CAN  STILL OCCUR WITH THE INDIVIDUAL?
LOOK, YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE WERE WORKING OUT IN THE EARLY 1300s HOW IT IS THIS AT TOM  COULD MAKE SENSE WITH NUCLEUS AND ELECTRONS, THEY WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT PONG. MANY YEARS LATER PEOPLE FOUND THAT, WOW, THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS. THERE'S SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. WE CAN DO ELECTRONICS. AND IT CHANGES THE WORLD. I DON'T THINK WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE AT THE TIME WE'RE DOING IT. BUT SOMEHOW IT SEEMS THAT THESE ADVANCES COME MAYBE NOT EXACTLY IN TANDEM BUT CERTAINLY WHEN WE  HAVE MORE KNOWLEDGE TO THINK THROUGH THEM.
Jon: IS THERE ANY... WHY DO YOU THINK THE FURTHER WE GET  INTO IT, WE'RE STILL STUCK IN THAT FOSSIL FUEL, YOU KNOW, ENGINE, AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE FOR 100-SOME YEARS WITH ALL THE ADVANCES WE MADE IN SO MANY  AREAS, WHY ENERGY IS STILL SOMEWHAT IN ITS 1880s, 180 R 90s FORM STILL.
THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. BECAUSE I'M THE SCIENTIST DOESN'T MEAN I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
HERE'S THE THING. HERE'S PART OF THE ANSWER. YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING AND I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS ENTIRELY SCIENCE. I THINK PART OF IT IS SCIENCE. THERE ISN'T A MAGIC BULLET YET. THEY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THE NEW BATTERY THAT'S GOING TO REPLACE EVERYTHING AT THIS POINT. AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT SCIENCE. AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THE WAY THE WEB HAPPENS OR THINGS EXPO INNOCENT ESTIMATE. YOU HAVE TO DO SOME HARD RESEARCH TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING. I THINK OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF ENTRENCHED BUSINESS INTERESTS. THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS INVOLVED THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE. AND I THINK THAT GETS CONFUSED, HOW SCIENCE INTERFACES WITH THE WORLD. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW A SCIENTIFIC THING AND HOW IT'S BEING USED.
IT'S SO NICE TO FINALLY HAVE SOMEONE COME ON AND TELL US TO  OUR FACES IT'S ALL A BIG SCAM. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. KNOCKING ON HEAVEN'S DOOR. YOU GOT TO GET THIS. LISA RANDALL.
