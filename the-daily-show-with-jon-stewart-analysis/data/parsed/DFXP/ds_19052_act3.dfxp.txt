Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A JOURNALIST WHO HAS REPORTED EXTENSIVELY FROM AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "STRINGER:  A REPORTER'S JOURNEY IN THE CONGO." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ANJAN SUNDARAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS -- THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY WELL WRITTEN NARRATIVE  ABOUT YOUR TIME IN THE CONGO AS A YOUNG MAN. BUT IT -- YOU WERE 22 YEARS OLD AND YOU WERE GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE.
UH-HUH.
Jon: WHERE WERE YOU IN SCHOOL?
I WENT TO YALE.
Jon: YALE. SO, A SAFETY SCHOOL AND YOU HAD A DEGREE  IN WHAT?
MATHEMATICS.
Jon: SO YOU HAD A JOB OFFER AT WHAT WAS THE NAME OF COMPANY?
GOLDMAN SACHS.
Jon: GOLDMAN SACHS, I BELIEVE IT WAS. YOU WENT TO YALE YOU HAD A DEGREE IN MATHEMATICS AND A JOB OFFER AT GOLDMAN SACHS AND YOU CALLED YOUR MOTHER AND SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I'M ACTUALLY JUST GOING TO MOVE TO THE CONGO. [LAUGHTER]
AND SHE CRIED.
Jon: SHE CRIED. SHE WEPT WITH HAPPINESS.
WITH HAPPINESS.
Jon: DID YOU HAVE A JOB LINED UP IN THE CONGO?
NO, I BOUGHT A ONE-WAY TICKET AND SHOWED UP THERE. NO ONE PAID FOR ME. NO ONE SENT ME THERE. I JUST SHOWED UP.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS -- LET ME SEE IF I CAN FRAME THIS CORRECTLY:  WHY? [LAUGHTER]
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, THE REAL REASON I HAD READ THAT THREE MILLION PEOPLE, NOW IT'S FIVE MILLION PEOPLE HAD DIED. NO ONE WAS REPORTING ABOUT IT.
Jon: YOU WERE 22.
YES.
Jon: AND YOU HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND, THE PERCEPTION AND THE EMPATHY TO THINK THIS IS WHERE I NEED TO GO TO BRING THIS SITUATION TO LIGHT. IT'S REMARKABLE. [  APPLAUSE  ]
I FELT THE INSTINCT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: IT'S WONDERFUL. SO YOU GET THERE AND YOU CALL -- YOU WANT TO BECOME A STRINGER I GUESS THEY CALL THEM. SOMEBODY  WHO'S FREELANCING.
I  DIDN'T WANT TO BECOME A STRINGER. I BECAME A STRINGER, I WANTED A JOB. I WANTED SOMEONE TO PAY FOR ME TO REPORT ON WHAT  WAS HAPPENING IN CONGO. INSTEAD I GOT THIS GIG AS A STRINGER WHERE I WAS PAID 15 CENTS FOR EVERY WORD THAT THEY PUBLISHED. NOT EVERY WORD THAT I WROTE. NO SUPPORT, NO EXPENSES PAID NOTHING AT ALL IN WAY OF INSURANCE.
Jon: WOULD YOU WRITE THINGS LIKE "IT IS VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY HOT HERE."
I WOULD TRY TO WRITE LONG STORIES.
Jon: THE CONGO IS TO ME ONE OF MOST INTERESTING AND TRAGIC COUNTRIES IN AFRICA BECAUSE OF ITS VAST MINERAL WEALTH. IT'S AN INCREDIBLY RESOURCE-FILLED LAND THAT SOMEHOW THE POPULATION CANNOT REAP THE BENEFITS OF THIS MINERAL WEALTH.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOOK I DESCRIBE THIS JOURNEY I MAKE UP THE RIVER TO AN INDIAN BUSINESSMAN'S MINE. AND IT WAS STUNNING TO SEE TO WHAT EXTENT THE CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL OR DID NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THOSE AREAS. EVEN MORE SURPRISINGLY WHAT YOU FOUND WAS NOT PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN ABANDONED. I FOUND A PIGMY TRIBE THAT HAD GIVEN AWAY HUGE SWATHS OF FOREST FOR A FEW SACKS OF SALT TO INTERNATIONAL LOGGING COMPANIES. I SAW MASS GRAVES LEFT BY FOREIGN ARMIES. PEOPLE ASKED ME NOT FOR FOOD OR MONEY BUT METAL DETECTORS. THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE -- A SENSE THAT EVEN IN BACK COUNTRY CONGO YOU HAVE GLOBAL FORCES AT PLAY AND PEOPLES' LIVES ARE CAUGHT UP IN THIS AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN SOME REMOTE ABANDONED FORGOTTEN PLACE.
Jon: BUT IT IS FORGOTTEN BECAUSE IT'S THE TYPE OF COLONIALISM AND EXPLOITATION THAT YOU FEEL LIKE THESE POWERS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH ANYMORE. IT'S OLD SCHOOL EXPLOITATION, IN A WAY.
INDEED. AND THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT THERE ARE AFRICAN PLAYERS  INVOLVED. THERE ARE OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES WHO HAVE STEPPED IN WHERE ONCE IT WAS THE WEST. IT WAS THE COLONIAL POWERS THAT USED TO EXPLOIT CONGO. NOW THAT NO LONGER IS KOSHER SO NOW YOU HAVE TO -- YOU WORK THROUGH AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THAT IS MUCH HARDER TO BROACH AND TO CRITICIZE BECAUSE IT'S INTERNAL POLITICS AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN HISTORIES OF PLANS AND INTERNAL WARS THAT GO BACK CENTURIES. AND THEY ARE STILL SORTING ALL OF THAT OUT.
Jon: THE CHINESE AS WELL ARE NOW ENORMOUS PLAYERS.
YES. YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT INTERVENTION NOW WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT INDIANS THAT WORK AT A LEVEL OF SOCIETY AND THE CHINESE WHO WORK THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND COME IN WITH THESE ENORMOUS PROJECTS, HUGE ROADS RUNNING RIGHT ACROSS KINSHASA, MASSIVE BUILDINGS AND THE CONGOLESE FOR THEM THIS IS A SHOCK. THEY ARE USED TO NO GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE USED TO WORKING, WORKING, WORKING AND THEIR IDEAS NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING, NEVER ADD UP BECAUSE THERE ARE NO INSTITUTIONS OR ORGANIZATIONS TO TAKE THEIR IDEAS TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
Jon: WHY CAN'T THEIR GOVERNMENT GAIN A MORE CENTRALIZED CONTROL OVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE. THERE ARE VERY SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE IN GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE VERY WELL EDUCATED. THEY KNOW VERY WELL THE PROBLEMS OF THE AREA. WHY CAN'T THEY TURN THAT AROUND?
IT'S A PROBLEM OF LEADERSHIP. IT WILL TAKE SOME-- ...CONGO'S INDEPENDENCE HERO IS PATRICE LUMUMBA, WHO WAS A FREEDOM FIGHTER BACK IN 1960. HE WAS  ASSASSINATED WITH WESTERN ASSISTANCE.
Jon: WHAT? [LAUGHTER] THAT IS CRAZY, WESTERN ASSISTANCE. [LAUGHTER]
SINCE THEN THEY STRUGGLED TO FIND A NEW LEADER. AND VISION MEANS A LEADER WHO WILL BUILD INSTITUTIONS INSTEAD OF DESTROYING THEM, A LEADER WHO REALIZES THAT BUILDING INSTITUTIONS WILL BE BETTER NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR CHILDREN. INSTEAD YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO SUCCUMBED BECAUSE CONGO IS SO INCREDIBLY WEALTHY THEY SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION OF CUTTING DEALS WITH THE MYRIAD FORCES.
Jon: IT'S INCREDIBLE REPORTING. AND SO, WHAT IS YOUR NEXT BOOK GOING TO BE?
IT'S ABOUT RWANDA, ABOUT JOURNALISTS I TAUGHT IN RWANDA.
Jon: IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DID YOU SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS AT DISNEY LAND OR ANYTHING? YOU COULD USE A LITTLE DECOMPRESSION. IT'S REALLY A REMARKABLE INSIDE  LOOK INTO THE DAILY LIVES OF PEOPLE IN CONGO.  "STRINGER." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. ANJAN SUNDARAM.
