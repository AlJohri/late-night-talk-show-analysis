Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S THE COO  OF FACEBOOK. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "LEAN IN:   WOMEN, WORK AND THE WILL TO  LEAD."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM SHERYL SANDBERG. HELLO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GREAT, THANK YOU FOR  HAVING ME. GREAT TO BE HERE.
Stephen: I'M DELIGHTED YOU  ARE HERE. THE BOOK IS CALLED "LEAN IN."  YOU ARE THE COO OF FACEBOOK.
CORRECT.
Jon: CURIOSITY FOR MY SAKE,  WHAT DO YOU DO WITH PEOPLE AT  WORK MESSING AROUND ON FACEBOOK?
WE ENCOURAGE IT.
Jon: IT IS -- IT'S NOT LIKE  GET TO WORK. YOU ARE LIKE OH, YEAH! YOU CAN DO THAT ALL DAY.
ALL DAY. ALL DAY. WE USE IT. YEAH, IF YOU WANT TO APPLY --
Jon: I DON'T HAVE A THING. I DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT BECAUSE  I DON'T -- I'M NOT -- I DON'T  LIKE THE POKING PEOPLE. BELIEVE ME I HAVE AN AOL DISK I  PUT IN. MY MODEM MAKES NOISE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE BOOK -- LISTEN, YOU'VE  WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT WOMEN'S  ROLE IN THE WORKPLACE. YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN WHEN YOU  OPEN UP THAT DISCUSSION IT OPENS  YOU UP TO A GREAT DEAL OF SHALL WE SAY SPIRITED COMMENTARY BACK.
I KNEW THAT.
Jon: HAS THAT SURPRISED  YOU?
NO. THIS IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS  INDIVIDUALS, WHO WE ARE AS  PARENTS, WORKERS AS COLLEAGUES. IT'S PERSONAL FOR ME, TOO. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT DEBATE  BECAUSE I WROTE "LEAN IN"  BECAUSE I'M WORRIED THAT THE BLUNT TRUTH IS MEN STILL RUN THE  WORLD AND I'M NOT SURE THAT'S  GOING THAT WELL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I DON'T -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HONESTLY, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO  WITH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU WOULD -- SINCE THE 70s  WOMEN HAVE -- I MEAN WOMEN  GRADUATE HIGHER EDUCATION MORE THAN MEN. THEY'VE CERTAINLY ACHIEVED A  GREAT DEAL MORE IN THE WORKING  WORLD THAN THEY HAVE. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE BARRIERS  ARE STILL THERE OR THAT THERE'S  A DISCUSSION GOING ON EVENING AMONGST WOMEN THAT THERE'S AN  AMBIVALENCE THERE AS WELL?
SINCE THE 1970'S WOMEN HAVE  MADE MORE AND MORE PROGRESS AT  EVERY LEVEL EXCEPT AT THE TOP. WOMEN HAVE HAD 14% OF THE TOP  JOBS IN AMERICA FOR TEN YEARS. THERE'S A PLATEAU. THERE'S A STAGNATION. WE'RE HELD BACK BY LOTS OF  THINGS, SEXISM, DISCRIMINATION  AND TERRIBLE PUBLIC POLICY. WE'RE ALSO HELD BACK BY THE  STEREOTYPE. GO TO A PLAYGROUND THIS WEEKEND  AND YOU'LL HEAR LITTLE GIRLS  CALLED BOSSY. YOU WON'T HEAR LITTLE BOYS  CALLED BOSSY BECAUSE WE EXPECT  THEM. RATHER THAN CALL LITTLE GIRLS  BOSSY WE SHOULD SAY MY DAUGHTER  HAS EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP SKILLS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: MAY I ASK YOU:  IS  THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT  WHAT THEY CALL US?
YES, THERE IS ACTUALLY. BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS THAT MEN  NEED TO LEAN IN, TOO.
Jon: I MEANT OUR KIDS.
WHAT YOUR KIDS CALL YOU?
Jon: YES.
NO, THAT'S OUT OF MY REALM.
Jon: IF A GUY WROTE THIS  BOOK ABOUT MEN. IT WOULDN'T GET HEATED. WOMEN GET JUDGED ON A MUCH  STRICTER BASIS FOR EVERYTHING  THEY DO. WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT? I FEEL LIKE NO MATTER WHAT WOMEN  PUT OUT THERE IT BECOMES DRKT  WOMAN WHO PUT OUT HER BOOK ON RAISING KIDS SHE BECAME KNOWN AS  THE TIGER MOM. SOMETHING ELSE. SHE TOOK WAY MORE FLACK THAN IF  A MAN PUT OUT A SIMILAR BOOK. WHY DO YOU THINK WOMEN ARE JUDGE  JUDGED MORE HASHY?
THE STEREOTYPES RUN DEEP AND  SMART IN CHILDHOOD. MEN SHOULD LEAD, SPEAK UP AND  HAVE OPINION. WOMEN SHOULD NURTURE, HELP  OTHERS AND SIT BACK. NATIONAL RETAILER PRINTED UP  T-SHIRTS THE BOYS, SMART LIKE  DADDY, THE GIRLS, PRETTY LIKE  MOMMY. NOT IN THE 1950'S, TWO YEARS  AGO. WHEN MEN SPEAK OUT AND GET MORE  SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE BETTER LIKED  BUT WOMEN ARE LESS LIKED. I THINK WE CAN CHANGE THAT. NOW IS OUR MOMENT TO CHANGE  THAT. IF WE UNDERSTAND THE STEREOTYPES  AND HOW THEY ARE HOLDING US  BACK, THEY CAN CHANGE.
Jon: HOW MUCH IS ACCESS TO  THE HALLS OF POWER AND HOW MUCH  IS THE AMBIVALENCE FOR WOMEN EVENING AMONGST THEMSELVES  BECAUSE IT SEEMED EASIER TO  CHANGE THE ACCESS TO POWER THAN TO CHANGE THE CULTURAL PRESSURES  THAT WOMEN FACE. I THINK WOMEN FACE VERY, VERY  STRONG CULTURAL PRESSURE.
HUGE. I THINK YOU HAVE TO CHANGE BOTH. WE HAVEN'T CHANGED BOTH. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE  ARE. THIS HOLDS WOMEN BACK. MY FRIEND RACHAEL WAS TALKING  ABOUT THE BOOK SHE'S FIVE. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU IF DADDY DID  BETTER AT WORK EVERYONE LIKES  HIM MORE AND IF MOMMY DOES BETTER AT WORK PEOPLE LIKED ME  LESS WELL. SHE SAID MOMMY, I WOULD DO LESS  WELL AT WORK SO PEOPLE WILL LIKE  ME. IF WE ALL LEAN IN AND START  APPLAUDING GIRLS FOR LEADING ARC  PLAYING WOMEN FOR REACHING FOR AMBITIOUS POSTS WE CAN CHANGE  THIS.
Jon: HERE IS THE OTHER  THING -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH! STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT. THE OTHER THING THAT THAT WOMAN  COULD DO IS BUY THEM CHILDREN'S  BOOKS FROM NOW ON.
THAT WOULD WORK, TOO. THIS IS HEAVY DUTY FOR A  FIVE-YEAR-OLD. [LAUGHTER] I JUST RECENTLY GOT OUT OF HARRY  POTTER SERIES. [LAUGHTER] "LEAN IN" IT'S ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW. MORE
