FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HELLO, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". ANY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT MR. JOSH  BROLIN IS GOING TO BE HERE. HE WILL TALK ABOUT HIS  EXPERIENCE WITH ZEN BUDDAHISM  LIKE JEFF BRIDGES LAST NIGHT THAT HIS TO REWATCH TO  UNDERSTAND. OUR CREDIT GOT DOWNGRADED LAST  YEAR. I THINK WE CAN AGREE IT'S TIME  TO GET SERIOUS TO FIGURE OUT TO  RESTORE THE WORLD'S RESPECT FOR THE SOUNDNESS OF CURN CINCH A $1  TRILLION PLATINUM DOWN BE MINTED  AND THE GOVERNMENT COULD USE THAT TO PAY THE DEBT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: UM, I'M -- [ LAUGHTER ] AH NOT AN ECONOMIST -- [ LAUGHTER ] -- BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE  (bleep) UP, I SAY GOOD BIG OR  GO HOME. HOW BY DOOL 20 TRILLION COIN. FORGET ABOUT IT SAY I WAS  DIGGING THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE  CURBS AND EISENHOWER HAD THE $100QUILLION COIN AROUND. I KNOW IT'S REAL BECAUSE IT HAS  OUR NATION'S SYMBOL A UNIFORM  WITH A CENTURE. THAT TRADITIONAL AMERICA IS GONE  NOW, PLEASE DON'T LOOK THAT UP. HOW WOULD IT WORK?
IN THEORY THE TREASURY WOULD  MINT THE COIN AND WALK IT OVER  THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR DEPOSIT SO THE GOVERNMENT COULD PAY IT  BILLS.
Jon: REALLY? REALLY MR. TIBBL SNERKS. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T WANT TO BUST YOUR  BIBBLES HERE, BUT YOU KNOW YOU  ARE ONLY HOLDING A QUARTER, SNRIET SURE THEY COULD MINT A  TRILLION DOLLAR COIN AND WALK IT  OVER THE TREASURY EVEN THOUGH IT COULD BE THE MOST TEMPTING WALK  IN HISTORY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE  STORE ACROSS THE STREET IS CHOCOLATE, BLOWJOBS AND BEYOND. YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO -- [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED SOME  TRILLION DOLLAR COIN GIMMICK. WE NEED TO TAKE THE U.S. DOLLAR  SERIOUS AGAIN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL NOMINATE  HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE WHITE  HOUSE JACK LEW TOLL BET NEXT -- TO BE THE NEXT TREASURY  SECRETARY.
IT WILL BE HIS SIGNATURE AT  THE BOTTOM OF OUR CURRENCY. IT WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE  THIS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT INJURE SIGNATURE? OR JUT -- THAT IS YOUR  SIGNIFICANT IN SIGNATURE  OR ARE YOU TESTING TO SEE IF THE PEN WORKS? [ LAUGHTER ] HEY, LEW, SHIRE -- HERE IS A  TIP, STOP SIGNING YOUR CHECKS ON  THE TEACUP RIDE AT DISNEY WORLD. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE ALLOWED TO  HAVE THAT AS YOUR SIGNATURE IS  IF YOUR NAME IS BOOOOING, BOOOING, PLEASE COME FIRM JACK  LEW. PLEASE CONFIRM JACK LEW. I HAVE TO HAVE THIS MAN AS  TREASURY SECRETARY. SERIOUSLY IF THIS GUY GETS  CONFIRMED IT WOULD BE THE SECOND  MOST RIDICULOUS SIGNATURE ONLY TO APPEAR ON OUR MONEY THANKS TO  BUCHANAN'S SECRETARY OLIVER  LEWIS OTTINGHAM. I SEE THE AUDIENCE WENT TO  SEVENTH GRADE LIKE I DID. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M 50. CAN CAN TELL YOU WHY GUY WHO  WILL FIND HIM ROLLING IN JACK  LEW DOODLE STACKS AS MONEY WILL SOON BE CALLED, AL GORE.
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE  SAY RICHER MAN TONIGHT ABOUT  $100 MILLION RICHER AFTER SELLING HIS LITTLE WATCHED CABLE  CHANNEL CURRENT TV TO THE ARAB  NEWS CHANNEL AL JAZEERA.
Jon: OH, MAN! FORMER DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENT  TURNED CLIMATE-CHANGE CRUSADER  SELLS OPENLY LIBERAL CABLE CHANNEL TO A MUSLIM. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I THINK WE  HAVE OUR FIRST FOX BONER ALERT  OF 2013. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AL JAZEERA OWNED BY THE OIL  SHEIK DOM OF QATAR, RIGHT. BIG GORE WHO HATES BIG OIL IS  MAKING A TON OF MONEY BY SELLING  IT TO BIG OIL.
Jon: IT'S A LEGITIMATE  POINT, ACTUALLY. YOU WOULD THINK IF WOE SELL TO  TOMS OF MAINE OR PEDAL AIR, THE  WORLD'S ONLY BICYCLE BASED  AIRLINE. WELL PLAYED, FOX. YOU GOT HIM.
AS IT TURNS OUT THE LIBERAL  MULTIMILLIONAIRE MOGUL TRIED TO  PUSH TO COMPLETE A DEAL TO SELL HIS CURRENT TV CHANNEL TO AL  JAZEERA BEFORE ANY OF NEW TAX  HIKES WOULD AFFECT THE PAYDAY.
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SCRAMBLING  IT DIDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL  JANUARY 2.
Jon: SO IT'S LESS OF A  BURN. YOU KNOW, AL GORE ALMOST  RECEIVED SOMETHING HE REALLY  WANTED BUT MISSED IT BY A HAIR DUE TO A MATH MAT CALL TECH  TECHNICALITY ALSO KNOWN AS THE  AL GORE STORY. [ LAUGHTER ] FOX DOESN'T HAVE TO THE CALL  DOESN'T LOOK LIKES IF A FOUR  HOUR OWE -- ERECTION. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS  PICTURE. AL GORE SOLD HIS CABLE NETWORK  TO -- WAIT FOR IT -- AL  GENTLEMAN ZEER THE ANTI-AMERICAN  NETWORK.
HE SELLS HIS NEWS NETWORK TO  A CLEARLY ANTI-AMERICAN NEWS  CHANNEL CALLED AL JAZEERA.
NOW YOU HIT ON IT.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT IS JUST CRAZY.
Jon: THAT MEANS MUSLIMS  WILL BE ABLE TO SEE INTO OUR  HOMES. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? PEOPLE ON TV CAN SEE INTO YOUR  HOMES. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, LOOK, AL JAZEERA'S ARABIC  CHANNEL HAS BROADCAST SOME VERY  HATEFUL STUFF. WORST HANUKKAH SPECIAL EVER. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS HATEFUL. ALTHOUGH THE NETWORK THAT WOULD  AIR IN CURRENT'S PLACE ISN'T THE  AL JAZEERA THAT RUNS IN THE ARAB WORLD IT'S AL JAZEERA ENGLISH. BUT IT'S A SUB SUBSIDIARY OF WHO  THEY SOLD TO. LET'S LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS. [SPEAKING ARABIC] [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE  TRUE WOULD YOU THINK MATZOH  WOULD BE FOR FLAVORFUL. IT'S ALL OF. THAT DIDN'T AIR ON AL JAZEERA. IT AIR ON ANOTHER TELEVISION  STATION OWNED BY A SAUDI PRINCE  AND 20% AFTER THIS IS OWNED BY A GUY NAMED RUPERT MURDOCH. THAT LAST NAME IS FAMILIAR BUT I  CAN'T PLACE WHAT HIS OTHER  HOLDINGS ARE. BUT THAT IS THE SAME NETWORK  THAT AIR VALLEY OF THE WOVLES  WHERE AMERICAN SOLDIERS THE BAD GUYS MASSACRING CIVILIANS AND  STEALING ARAB ORGANS TO SELL  THEM TO JEWS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. RUPERT MURDOCH PROFITING FROM  THE ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA. WORDS FAIL ME.
LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT IT'S  KNOWN FOR. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE  ANTI-AMERICAN NETWORK.
A CLEARLY ANTI-AMERICAN  NETWORK CALLED ROTANA.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THANK IS CRAZY.
Jon: A DEGREE WITH YOU  GUYS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
