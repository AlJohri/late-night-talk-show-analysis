Jon: WE WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. THIS WEEK THE SUPREME COURT IS  HEARING TWO LANDMARK CASES ABOUT  GAY MARRIAGE. WE'LL HAVE BIG COVERAGE TOMORROW  BUT THE DISCUSSION IS TAKING  PLACE, THE LEVEL OF DISCOURSE WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM THE  NATION'S HIGHEST COURT.
DO YOU WANT US TO STEP IN AND  RENDER A DECISION BASED ON AN  ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF THIS INSTITUTION WHICH IS NEWER  THAN CELL PHONES OR THE  INTERNET?
Jon: YES. EVERYONE KNOWS LOVE IS A NEW  INVENTION. I THINK IT GOES MICROWAVES, CELL  PHONES, THEN LOVE THEN GOGURT. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE THE DECISION WILL COME  AT A TIME WHEN PUBLIC OPINION IS  RAPIDLY SWINGING IN FAVOR OF GAY  MARRIAGE. THERE'S BEEN AN AVALANCHE OF  GOOD NEWS FOR SUPPORTS.
SENATOR CLAIRE McCASS KILL  OF MISSOURI ANNOUNCED HER  SUPPORT.
SENATOR JOHN TESTER. THREE MORE SENATORS HAVE VOICED  THEIR PORN, MARK WARNER, JAY  ROCKEFELLER AND SENATOR MARK  BEGICH.
Jon: IT HAS ALL THE MAKINGS  OF THE HISTORIC SHIFT IN PUBLIC  OPINION AND THE MOST BORING GAY PRIDE PARADE FLOAT EVER. WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE TRIGGERED  THIS WAVE OF MIND CHANGING WAS  ONE BRAVE SENATOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT LAST WEEK.
GAY MARRIAGE HAS PICKED UP A  PROMINENT NEW SUPPORTER, SENATOR  ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO. THE ONLY REPUBLICAN IN THE U.S. SENATE TO TAKE THAT POSITION.
Jon: BRAVO ROB PORTMAN. I ASSUME SENATOR PORTMAN THOUGHT  LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS AND  REALIZED IT'S PURELY ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE ISSUE HE NEEDS  TO STAND UP FOR FAIRNESS AND  EQUAL QUIT.
HE CHANGED HIS CHANGE OF  HEART. HE SAID IT BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO  AGO WHEN HIS COLLEGE AGED SON  TOLD HIS FAMILY THAT HE IS GAY.
Jon: THAT WOULD DO IT, TOO. I NEVER REALIZED A HUMAN BEING  COULD ACTUALLY BE GAY UNTIL MY  WIFE AND I ACCIDENTALLY MADE  ONE. NOT ALL HIS REPUBLICANS ARE SO  EASILY SWAYED.
SENATOR SAX BY CHAMBLISS IS  REAFFIRMING HIS OPPOSITION TO  GAY MARRIAGE HE SAID "I'M NOT  GAY. I'M NOT GOING TO MARRY ONE."
Jon: I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU  COULD SOANL SUPPORT IT IF YOU  WERE GOING TO MARRY WHO YOU ARE  LIKE. I WISH HIM LUCK FINDING A  (bleep) TO MARRY.
ANOTHER BIG VOICE ENDORSED  GAY MARRIAGE. FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE  HILLARY CLINTON.
Jon: HILLARY CLINTON. DIDN'T SHE DO THAT 20 YEARS AGO? IS THERE ANY ELSE YOU ARE IN  FAVOR OF YOU ARE STUL MULLING  OVER. HILLARY CLINTON AS CHANGED HER  MIND. ALBANIANS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO  DRIVE. [LAUGHTER] SAX BY CHAMBLISS MAY NOT GET  WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE EXCLUDE BUT  I'M GUESSING HILLARY CLINTON HAS FACED HER SHARE OF  DISCRIMINATION. HOW DID IT TAKE TO LONG AND HOW  IS THIS GUY NOT THERE?
JUST BECAUSE I BELIEVE STATES  SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFINE  MARRIAGE IN A TRADITIONAL WAY DOES NOT MAKE ME A BIGOT.
Jon: OKAY. FIRST OF ALL. UM, IS THERE A TIME WHEN THIS  GUY DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE  DESPERATELY THIRSTY? I FEEL LIKE HE MUST HAVE A  PRESPEECH RITUAL WHERE HE LICK  PRISCUTTO. HE HAS A MADE. BELIEVING IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO  THE STATE DOESN'T MAKE YOU A  BIGOT BUT BELIEVING THE STATES SHOULD DEFINE IT AS TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE THAT DOES. LET'S TURN TO THE NEW RISING  STAR DR. BEN CARSON.
MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND  A WOMAN. NO GROUP BE THEY GAYS, BE THEY  NAMBLA, BE THEY PEOPLE WHO  BELIEVE IN BESTIALITY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY ARE.
Jon: LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT  THERE IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU ARE  HAVING SEX WITH A CONSENTING ADULT OR A HORSE OR A DOUGHNUT. IT'S ALL THE SAME. THAT'S NOT FAIR. HE'S FINE. HIS PROBLEM ISN'T WITH GAY  PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING AGAINST  GAYS, IT'S AGAINST ANYBODY WHO  WANTS TO COME ALONG AND CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITIONS OF  PILLARS EVER SOCIETY.
Jon: YOU THINK WE SHOULDN'T  MESS WITH ANYTHING THAT IS A  FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF SOCIETY. BLACK NEUROSURGEON WHO DOES  PROUDLY STAND IN FRONT OF A  MEDICAL SCHOOL, THE ROAD TO THAT SCHOOL IS BROKEN PILLAR PARTS  LABORED SLAVERY, SEGREGATION AND  JIM-CROW AND THERE'S A GAY SAD LOOKING NEARBY AND IN TACT  PILLAR THAT SAYS TRADITIONAL  MARRIAGE AND A THOUGHT BUBBLE THAT SAYS LITTLE HELP? LET ME SHOW YOU. THAT'S JUST UM, I DREW THIS  IS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYWAY THAT IS MY IDEA FOR THE  EDITORIAL CARTOON. THIS IS JUST A PENIS CANNON  SHOOTING AN AIRPLANE BECAUSE  IT'S ALL I REALLY KNOW HOW TO  DRAW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
