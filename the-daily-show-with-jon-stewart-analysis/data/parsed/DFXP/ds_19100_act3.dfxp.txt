Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE SIMEON E. BALDWIN PROFESSOR OF LAW EMERITUS AT YALE UNIVERSITY. ALSO AN AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WHY GOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN AND HOW IT CAN DO BETTER." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM PETER SCHUCK. SIR, HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS, THIS, THIS, THIS, WHY GOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN AND HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. WHY IS THIS NOT MORE A PART OF THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION? WHY DO YOU THINK THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION IS SO TIED UP IN CONFLICT AND PARTISAN RHETORIC AND NOT THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNANCE?
WELL, A FEW REASONS. ONE REASON IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY WISH WOULD HAPPEN, HOW THE WORLD SHOULD BE, RATHER THAN THE WAY IT ACTUALLY IS, THE WAY IT WORKS OUT IN REALITY. MOST OF US ARE LIKE THAT. SECONDLY, THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW IN MANY CASES WHY IT'S PROGRAMS DO SO POORLY.
Jon: DO THEY HAVE -- WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS OF GOVERNMENT TO ASSESS THAT? WHAT ARE THE METRICS THEY USE AND WHAT DO THEY EVEN DO TO ASSESS IT?
THERE'S A FEW AGENCIES LIKE THE GAO AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE AND INSPECTORS GENERAL OF VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS, THEY DO PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS OF PROGRAMS BUT ONLY WHEN CONGRESS ASKS THEM TO DO THAT OR DIRECTS THEM TO DO THAT. THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES, COST EFFECTIVENESS IS USUALLY THE MAJOR CRITERION.
Jon: AND, ARE THOSE FINDINGS USUALLY UTILIZED? ARE THEY IMPLEMENTED? WHAT'S THE RESULT OF THAT?
THEY'RE PUBLISHED. WHETHER THEY'RE UTILIZED OR NOT.
Jon: THEY'RE JUST PUBLISHED. [LAUGHTER] WELL THAT'S VERY LOVELY.
LIKE MY BOOK.
Jon: EXACTLY YOUR BOOK IS PUBLISHED. IT'S PERFECT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT YOU DID WHICH IS LONG OVERDUE IS YOU TRY TO FIND A WAY TO ATTACH VALUE TO THESE PROGRAMS. YOU HEAR FROM -- I THINK FOR PEOPLE WHO STILL BELIEVE GOVERNMENT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN IMPROVING PEOPLES LIVES AND THEN WE WATCH THEM NOT BE ABLE TO DO THE SIMPLEST OF TASKS LIKE PROCESS VETERAN HEALTH CLAIMS IN AN EFFICIENT WAY IS DISHEARTENING. AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE PEOPLE JUST SAY, WELL IT'S TOO BIG AND YOU HAVE TO CUT MONEY WITHOUT ATTACHING BIGNESS OR MONEY TO ANY VALUE THAT IT MAY BE PROVIDED.
RIGHT, WELL YOU HAD A SEGMENT I THINK LAST WEEK ABOUT THE V.A. AND THE COVERUP THAT OCCURRED AFTER IT WAS REVEALED. ALTHOUGH, PEOPLE WHO WATCH THESE THINGS HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THE V.A. BACKLOGS ARE TERRIBLE. REALLY TERRIBLE. THEY ARE REDUCED AND ONCE THEY ARE REDUCED IT'S LIKE A HIGHWAY. YOU REDUCE CONGESTION AND MORE PEOPLE COME ON.
Jon: WHY DO THEY HAVE SUCH TROUBLE REFORMING CLEARLY FAILING OR INEFFICIENT SYSTEMS? IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS CAN FIND LOTS OF REASONS TO THINK THAT THEY ARE SUCCEEDING AND THERE ARE ALWAYS LOTS OF INTERESTS WHO WANT THEM TO DO MORE OF THE SAME. SO IT REQUIRES PEOPLE, LIKE ME, AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO WILL ACTUALLY GO AND LOOK AT THE DATA REALLY CAREFULLY AND MAKE SOME JUDGMENTS ABOUT WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT.
Jon: YOU MENTIONED THE HOMESTEAD ACT AS A PROGRAM THAT WAS COST EFFICIENT, YOU KNOW, A RESOURCE WAS GIVEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND THAT HELPED US SETTLE THE WEST. SO, THAT IS CONSIDERED A SUCCESS.
WELL, THAT WAS A RELATIVELY EASY CASE BECAUSE THE LAND WAS BASICALLY FREE EXCEPT FOR THE INDIANS WHO HAPPENED TO LIVE THERE AND WERE MASSACRED ALONG THE WAY.
Jon: SURE.
Jon: I'M SURE ON THEIR "THE DAILY SHOW" THEY ARE HAVING A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.  [LAUGHTER]
THAT WAS RELATIVELY EASY. IT DIDN'T COST ANYBODY ANYTHING REALLY EXCEPT FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS.
Jon: YOU COULD REALLY JUST END EVERY CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS COUNTRY WITH THAT PHRASE, BY THE WAY. SO IT WORKED OUT, EXCEPT FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING A LITTLE WONKIER SOCIAL SECURITY?
SOCIAL SECURITY HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BUT IT'S GOING INSOLVENT. FORTUNATELY WITH SOCIAL SECURITY THERE ARE A LOT OF RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD FIXES THAT COULD BE DONE. YOU CAN EXTEND THE RETIREMENT AGE, YOU CAN TAX UPPER INCOME RECIPIENTS. PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
Jon: YES, EXACTLY. KICK IT IN, BABY I'M READY.
BUT, YOU ARE NOT 65 YET. SO, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
Jon: YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE MY BODY. I'M ABOUT 93. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU CAN INCREASE THE WAGES THAT ARE TAXABLE. THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO DO IT.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS A MORE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS OR THERE HAS TO BE A MORE FUNDMENTAL CHANGE IN THE WAY WE VIEW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY?
I THINK IT'S BOTH. IT'S NOT JUST ACTIVE MANAGEMENT. THE MANAGEMENT IS OFTEN VERY INTERIOR. OUR BUREAUCRACY HAS BEEN DEBASED AND DEGRADED OVER TIME. IT HAS A TERRIBLE MORALE PROBLEM. MUCH MORE SO THAN IT USED TO.
Jon: BUT, THAT'S A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM MORE THAN IT IS, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE I TALK TO IN THE BUREAUCRACY ARE GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD HEARTED, PRETTY MUCH WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT DON'T HAVE THE MARCHING ORDERS.
BUT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. THERE'S BEEN MUCH MORE LAYERING OF POLITICAL APPOINTEES ON TOP OF THEM TO A MUCH GREATER EXTENT THAN IN THE PAST. SO, THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF AUTONOMY, THE SAME SORT OF SENSE OF MISSION THEY USED TO. IN THE BOOK I DISCUSS A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE INTERVIEWED THEM AND HAVE DONE A VARIETY OF TESTS TO SEE HOW THIS BUREAUCRACY IS FUNCTIONING. IT'S IN DEEP CRISIS.
Jon: WE'RE IN THE DEEP CRISIS. WE'RE ON THE PRECIPICE OF COLLAPSE. WE'RE GOING TO COMMERCIAL, YOU'LL BE ON THE WEB AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US HOW TO FIX IT AND YOU'LL HAVE THREE MINUTES. WHY GOVERNMENT FAILS SO OFTEN. THIS IS THE BOOK. THESE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT THE NEWS NETWORKS I THINK SHOULD BE HAVING.
THEY DON'T.
Jon: YEAH, NO. I KNOW. PETER SCHUCK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
