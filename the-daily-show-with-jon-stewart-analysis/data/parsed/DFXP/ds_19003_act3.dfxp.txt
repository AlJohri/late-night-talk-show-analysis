[APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FROM HER NEW  FILM CALLED "GRAVITY." MY GUEST TONIGHT, FROM HER NEW  FILM CALLED "GRAVITY."
LISTEN TO MY VOICE. YOU NEED TO FOCUS. A FEW SECONDS I WON'T BE ABLE TO TRACK YOU. I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE. DO IT NOW!
HOUSTON, I'VE LOST VISUAL.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW, SANDRA BULLOCK. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING? [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S UP?
Jon: MAN, IT'S A GOOD MOVIE.
GLAD YOU LIKE IT. WHY DO YOU MAKE THAT FACE  THOUGH?
Jon: BECAUSE IT'S UPSETTING  TO ME. TO SEE SUCH GOOD MOVIES WHEN I'M TRYING TO MAKE ONE.
I KNOW THAT FEELING. I'VE BEEN IN THAT POSITION MUCH  OF MY CAREER.
Jon: I'M BACK THERE SCRAPING  AWAY AND LIKE -- I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU MADE IT BECAUSE I  FEEL LIKE THAT WILL -- IT IS  TRULY TECHNOLOGICALLY  SPECTACULAR.
YEAH. THEY DID AN AMAZING JOB.
Jon: AMAZING.
EACH FRAME HAD AT LEAST 250  PEOPLE WORKING ON EACH  PARTICULAR FRAME AT ONE POINT. THAT'S HOW MUCH LOVE WENT INTO  EACH FRAME.
Jon: SO THEY -- BUT THAT'S  NORMALLY LIKE WHAT YOU DO WITH  AN ANIMATED FILM. THIS IS NOT ANIMATION.
I MEAN, IT'S -- THERE'S A  PART OF IT IS THAT IS SIMILAR.
Jon: REALLY? YOU WERE IN SPACE.
WE WERE IN SPACE. RIGHT.
Jon: SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING  THAT, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE. HOW MUCH TRUST DO YOU HAVE TO  HAVE IN THIS DIRECTOR, WHO IS A  FABULOUS DIRECTOR?
YOU KNOW, 1000%.
Jon: YOU HAVE TO TRUST.
AS ALL YOUR ACTORS HAVE TO  TRUST YOU.
Jon: YEAH.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DO AN AMAZING JOB. YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOOD AT THIS.
Jon: WE'RE GETTING THERE. THE AMAZING THING IS, NORMALLY A MOVIE OF THIS KIND OF  TECHNOLOGICAL PRECISION AND  ACUITY DOESN'T HAVE EMOTION IN  IT. THEY FIND A WAY TO BLEED THAT  OUT.
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SO  CONCENTRATED ON THE AMAZING  ASPECTS OF THE EFFECTS, WHICH  THEY ARE AMAZING. I CAN SEE YOU GETTING LOST IN  THAT. THE WAY THAT ALFONSO THE  DIRECTOR USED IT WAS ALL TO ACCENTUATE FEAR AND JOY. IT WAS ALL TO MAKE THE EMOTION  STRONGER AND TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE THIS WORLD IN A WAY THAT YOU NEVER COULD HAVE HAD THAT TECHNOLOGY NOT EXISTED. IT DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL WEEKS  BEFORE WE STARTED SHOOTING IN  MANY CASES.
Jon: YOU GO BACK NOW AND YOU  WATCH OTHER SPACE MOVIES,  THEY'RE STILL ENJOYABLE. LIKE 2001, I WATCH THAT SCENE  WHERE THEY'RE BURSTING THROUGH  THE WHATEVER HYDRO ZONE WITH  EVERYTHING FLYING OUT AND I'M  LIKE -- YOU KNOW? [LAUGHTER]
KUBRICK IS GOING TO STRIKE YOU DOWN.
Jon: YOU THINK SO?
YEAH.
Jon: WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN  THE THEATER AND YOU'RE WATCHING  IT, YOU DO -- LIKE I FEEL LIKE  I'M -- I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE NOW TO -- NOT TO GIVE AWAY THE  MOVIE, BUT TO FIGHT ALIENS IN SPACE.
OH!  [LAUGHTER] YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE -- YOU GAVE  EVERYTHING AWAY.
Jon: CLOONEY PLAYS A  CHARISMATIC LADIES MAN. IT'S NOT BELIEVABLE. I DIDN'T --
THE THING YOU HAVE TO DO --  WE ASK YOU TO SUSPEND BELIEF. LOOK, I'M FLYING. DID YOU BELIEVE THAT?
Jon: BUT I THOUGHT YOUR  ACTING WAS UNBELIEVABLE. I WAS LIKE OH, NO, SANDRA!
BUT --
Jon: I KNOW HER. SHE'S REALLY NICE.
SO YOU BUY ME FLYING BUT YOU  DON'T BUY CLOONEY BEING A LADIES MAN, CHARMING?
Jon: COME ON.
I SEE YOUR POINT.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT IS -- THE  SIMPLICITY WHAT IS CRAZY ABOUT  IT IS, IT'S TWO PEOPLE IN JUST  LIKE -- I IMAGINE WHEN YOU'RE  DOING IT, JUST IN CHAIRS. IT IS INCREDIBLY GRIPPING, THE  TWO OF YOU TOGETHER, HAVE THIS  INTERPLAY LIKE -- IT'S REALLY  BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
WHEN YOU SEE TWO PEOPLE IN  CHAIRS, IT JUST HAPPENS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU EITHER HAVE A  BEAUTIFUL INTERPLAY OR GET  NAUSEOUS FROM THE G-FORCE.
HERE I FEEL INTERPLAY.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER BEEN UP -- HAVE YOU EVER DONE AN ANTI  GRAVITY FLIGHT?
THEY WERE GOING TO DO THAT. THAT IS WHAT I WAS SOLD ON. NOW THAT I WANTED TO DO THAT,  BUT THEY SAID THIS IS THE ONLY  WAY WE CAN GET THESE CERTAIN  SCENES, BY DROPPING YOU OUT OF  THE AIR IN A PERFECTLY FINE  WORKING PLANE. I SAID ALL RIGHT, IF THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TO DO. THEY DIDN'T TELL ME WE WEREN'T  DOING IT UNTIL A WEEK BEFORE I  WAS TO GET THERE. GEORGE LET ME KNOW THEY  ABANDONED THAT BECAUSE THEY  FOUND THESE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT  THAT WERE LIKE SMALL TORTURE  CHAMBERS.
Jon: IT'S HARD FOR ME TO  BELIEVE YOU WEREN'T ON A  DIFFERENT PLANET. THE GRAVITY STUFF IS SO -- THE  SCENE WHERE YOU PROJECTILE  VOMIT. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING  ELSE.
BUT TO HIS CREDIT, WHEN YOU  PROJECTILE VOMIT, YOU HAVE NO  CONTROL OVER THE VELOCITY OVER  WHICH IT COMES OUT OF YOUR BODY  BECAUSE THE STOMACH DOING THE  WORK. IN ZERO G, YOU HAVE TO SLOW IT  DOWN TO 30%. BUT TO CONTROL IT AND SHOOT IT  OUT SLOWLY AND YET  MAINTAINING -- THAT'S NOT --  IT'S NOT EASY.
Jon: THE WORK THAT SHE DID,  JUST THE ESOPHAGUS WORK. YOU MAY WIN --  [APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, A QUICK DISCLAIMER. I GAVE AWAY NOTHING FROM THE  MOVIE. EVERYTHING I SAID ABOUT IT WAS A LIE. JUST TO POINT THAT OUT. PLEASE GO SEE IT. IT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.
Jon: YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. "GRAVITY" IS IN THEATERS FRIDAY. THANKS FOR COMING BY, SANDRA BULLOCK
