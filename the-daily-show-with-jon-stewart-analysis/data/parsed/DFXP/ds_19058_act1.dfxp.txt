FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAGGIE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. MY GUEST TONIGHT ELIZABETH BANKS "THE LEGO MOVIE." WHICH I'VE ALREADY SEEN FOUR TIMES. [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW IT ON FOX ON SUNDAY THERE BUT BEFORE THE SEAHAWKS SCRIMMAGED WITH THE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- TEAM OF STONED COLORADO TEENAGERS -- [LAUGHTER] -- FOX AIRED ANOTHER WORLD-CLASS MATCHUP AS THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE FREE WORLD SAT DOWN WITH OBAMA TO COVER TOPICS LIKE LOOSE NUKES, MIDDLE EAST PEACE, TRADE REGULATIONS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. I'M JUST (bleep) WITH YOU.
LIBYA. YOUR DETRACTORS BELIEVE YOU DID NOT TELL THE WORLD IT WAS A TERROR ATTACK BECAUSE YOUR CAMPAIGN DIDN'T WANT THAT OUT. I HAVE TO GET TO THE IRS. YOU ARE SAYING NO CORRUPTION. NONE.   HEALTH CARE. WHEN DID YOU KNOW THERE WERE GOING TO BE PROBLEMS WITH THOSE COMPUTERS?
Jon: LOOK AT THAT O'REILLY DIPPING WHOLESCALE INTO THE FULL FOX SCANDAL GRAB BAG. AND WHILE MANY OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS  IT'S A BIG SHOW, IT'S A SUPER BOWL PRESHOW YOU GOTTA PLAY THE HITS.  YOU THINK THE CHILI PEPPERS ARE GOING TO COME OUT AT HALFTIME IN THE SUPER BOWL AND NOT GO FULL NIPPLE? NO, THEY'RE GONNA GO FULL NIPPLE. [LAUGHTER] IT'S THE SUPERBOWL.
DO YOU THINK I'M UNFAIR TO YOU.
ABSOLUTELY, OF COURSE,  YOU ARE, BILL.
Jon: PASS THE NACHOS, MAMA.
WE JUST WENT THROUGH AN INTERVIEW IN WHICH YOU ASKED ABOUT HEALTH CARE NOT WORKING, IRS, WERE WE WHOLLY CORRUPT, BENGHAZI, THESE KINDS OF THINGS KEEP ON SURFACING IN PART BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR TV STATION WILL PROMOTE THEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HOLY MOLY. THAT IS QUITE AN ACCUSATION. THAT FOX NEWS UNFAIRLY PROMOTES AND IN SOME CASES CREATES SCANDALS -- [LAUGHTER] -- FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF UNDERMINING THIS PRESIDENT ALTHOUGH IN OBAMA'S DEFENSE, IT IS TRUE. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT FOX DOES EVERY DAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONE HOUR EVERY TWO WEEKS WHERE JOHN STOSSEL EXPOSES HOW HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE SCAMMING THE SYSTEM. [LAUGHTER] SO HOW DOES FOX NEWS RESPOND TO TO OUTRAGEOUS YET COMPLETELY ACCURATE CHARGE.
OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF, WELL HE DID WHAT HE DOES BEST AND HE TRIED TO, WELL. CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
PICKING A FIGHT WITH FOX NEWS IS A GREAT WAY TO DISTRACT THEM.
HE TRIED TO TURN IT AROUND INTO AN ATTACK ON FOX.
Jon: BRILLIANT MOVE. [LAUGHTER] DEFLECT THE SPOTLIGHT FROM YOUR MANY SCANDALS BY DOING AN INTERVIEW WITH FOX ABOUT THEM RIGHT BEFORE THE MOST WATCHED EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION. THAT OBAMA KEEPING IT ON THE DL. [LAUGHTER] [  APPLAUSE  ] THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT FOX HAS CAUGHT OBAMA HIDING HIS SCANDALS BY DOING THE OLD, SQUIRREL! LOOK OVER THERE. TAKE THE OBAMACARE ROLLOUT.
HE'S TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AWAY FROM OBAMACARE TO IMMIGRATION.
QUOTE, INCOME INEQUALITY. LET'S DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HAVE YOU CHASE RABBITS, DON'T FOCUS ON OBAMACARE.
NEWS OF THE NUKE DEAL DOMINATED POLITICAL TALK  WHICH MEANS FOCUS HAS SHIFTED AWAY FROM OBAMACARE. IT'S YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM THE DISASTROUS ROLLOUT.
HE IS TALKING ABOUT EQUAL RIGHTS FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS IN THE WORKPLACE. IS THIS DISTRACTION, DAVID?
Jon: YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WORK FOR FOX, RIGHT?  [LAUGHTER] HE CAN DEVIATE FROM YOUR SCRIPT. IT'S LIKE EQUAL RIGHTS FOR GAY  PEOPLE, THAT'S NOT YOUR LINE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOUR LINE IS, YES, OBAMACARE IS A REAR GUARD ASSAULT ON THE AMERICAN VALUES THAT WE HOLD  DEAR. SOON I AND MY MUSLIM OVERLORDS WILL CONTROL THE ENTIRE CALIPHATE. THAT'S YOUR LINE. SAY IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE -- FOX -- FOX HAS BEEN ALL OVER OBAMA'S MISDIRECTION JUJU FROM THE GETGO.
THE PRESIDENT FOUND TIME TO MAKE A SPEECH HIGHLIGHTING HIS STANCES ON DRONE STRIKES, AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.  THAT BEING BENGHAZI COVERUP.
PRESIDENT OBAMA USED TODAY'S SPEECH TO REASSERT A VERY DANGEROUS FOREIGN POLICY. HE'S DOING THIS TO DISTRACT US FROM THE IRS.
ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S A PUSH FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF GUN REGISTRATION. THIS IS JUST TO DIVERT ATTENTION AWAY FROM--
ABSOLUTELY IT'S A COMPLETE DISTRACTION.
THESE THINGS ARE PLANTED BY BARACK OBAMA ON PURPOSE, LAURA, TO DISTRACT US FROM WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON. IRS, DOJ, NSA, BENGHAZI.
Jon: I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THE MAY BE THE FOX NEWS BUDDHIST MANTRA. FIRST WE LIGHT THE CANDLES AND THEN OF COURSE, WE BEGIN TO PRAY.  OMM, IRS, DOJ, NSA, BENGHAZI, IRS, DOJ, NSA, BENGHAZI.  IRS, DOJ, NSA, BENGHAZI. OMM. [LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE] BUT IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT OBAMA HAS BEEN TRYING TO SQUIRREL US FOR HIS ENTIRE TERM IT'S GOT TO BE THE ECONOMY. THIS IS A DESPERATE POLITICAL PLOY BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO DISTRACT ATTENTION FROM THE FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM THE ECONOMY.
TODAY WE'RE ADDRESSING THE NSA. WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY. NOW WE HAVE DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT IT WAS OSAMA BIN LADEN. WHEN DO WE START, DO YOU THINK, TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY AGAIN?
Jon: REALLY, EVEN KILLING BIN LADEN WAS A PART OF OBAMA'S MASTER DISTRACTION PLAN. [LAUGHTER] REALLY? WHAT DO YOU THINK, HE WENT DOWN THERE, HEY, LOOK, OSAMA, WE BOYS, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN MY JOBS NUMBERS. [LAUGHTER] I'M SORRY, BRO I GOTTA TAKE YOU OUT. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY PORTUGUESE WATER DOGS CAN I ADOPT. [LAUGHTER] AT LONG LAST, PRESIDENT OBAMA, IS THERE NOTHING YOU WON'T DO TO DISTRACT US FROM THE ECONOMY?
ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER SO-CALLED MAJOR ADDRESS FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA. THIS WAS AT KNOX COLLEGE IN GAINESVILLE, ILLINOIS ON THE ECONOMY.  HOPING TO DISTRACT ATTENTION AWAY FROM HIS SCANDALS.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep). [LAUGHTER] I THOUGHT YOU SAID HE WAS USING THE SCANDALS TO DISTRACT US FROM THE ECONOMY AND NOW HE'S USING THE ECONOMY TO DISTRACT US FROM THE SCANDALS OH, GODDAMN IT. [CHEERS] HOLD ON. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? I'M JUST GOING TO GET OUT MY BOOK OF MATHEMATICS -- [LAUGHTER] -- HOLY (bleep) BY THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTIES OF DISTRACTION WE FIND  OURSELVES DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BEING CAUGHT IN A HAWKING-OPPENHEIMER DISTRACTION LOOP. CREATING A BLACK HOLE OF INFINITE DISTRACTION FROM WHICH WE CAN NEVER DIVERT OUR ATTENTION LONG ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT -- SQUIRREL -- WHAT IS HAPPENING. WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT IS FOX TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE? [LAUGHTER]
THEY'VE ALLOWED AN ENDLESS PARADE OF POLITICAL POSTURING AND PHONY SCANDALS TO DISTRACT FROM GROWING OUR ECONOMY AND STRENGTHENING THE MIDDLE CLASS.
Jon: OH, NO IT'S BEGUN! THE DISTRACTION LOOP. BUT I HAD AN IRS HEARING SCHEDULED FOR -- NOOOOOO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WAIT, HOLD ON. [  APPLAUSE  ] UNLESS, OF COURSE, FOX NEWS IS ATTEMPTING TO DISTRACT US FROM NOTICING THAT RATHER THAN BEING A NEWS ORGANIZATION  THEY ARE A SPITE-DRIVEN ANGER MACHINE ROOTED IN A FEAR  THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE STATUS QUO WILL INEVITABLY ERODE OUR NATION'S TRADITIONAL POWER STRUCTURE LEADING TO INTERNMENT CAMPS FOR REAL AMERICANS POWERED BY SOLAR ENERGY AND TACOS -- WAIT -- HARD SHELL GAY TACOS. [LAUGHTER] EH-- IT'S PROBABLY THE BLACK HOLE THING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
