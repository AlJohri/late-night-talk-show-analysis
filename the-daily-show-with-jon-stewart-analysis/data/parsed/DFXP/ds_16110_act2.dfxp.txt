(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELCOME BACK. REMEMBER, REMEMBER A FEW WEEKS AGO STANDARD & POOR'S DOWNGRADED PARKER'S CREDIT RATING. GUESS WHAT, S&P, PAYBACK'S A BITCH.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS REPORTEDLY LAUNCHED A PROBE INTO WHETHER STANDARD &  POOR'S CREDIT RATINGS AGENCY IMPROPERLY RATED MORTGAGE SECURITIES GIVING THEM  INTENTIONALLY HIGHER RATINGS WHILE KNOWING THEY WERE TROUBLED IN THE LEADUP TO  THE WORLD FINANCIAL CRISIS.
WHAT? WHAT'S UP, S&P, TELL ME HOW OUR ASS TASTES. YOU MESS WITH YOU, YOU MESS WITH YOU. YOU'RE MEAT. AND BY MEAT I MEAN WE LAUNCHED A PROBE AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO SEVERAL DEPOSITIONS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. PLUS INTERVIEWS BY INVESTIGATORS THAT IN SOME CASES COULD LEAD TO FINES. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A NEGOTIATION IN MANY RESPECTS. THE POINT IS THERE IS A STRONG CHANCE YOUR NAME WILL END UP IN A SCATHING EDITORIAL ON PAGE A 17 IN  "THE NEW YORK TIMES". SORRY S&P, BUT REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED SLOW AND WITH A GREAT DEAL OF  BUREAUCRATIC PAPERWORK. (LAUGHTER) YOU REALLY THOUGHT YOU COULD DOWNGRADE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND WALK AWAY. WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? IN FACT, I CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE THING A CREDIT RATING AGENCY COULD DO THAT WOULD BE A WORSE IDEA.
IN NEW JERSEY'S BOND RATING HAS TAKEN A HIT, FITCH DOWNGRADED THE STATE'S CREDIT RATING FROM AA TO AA MINE IS-- MINUS SAYING THE  STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER WORKER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS.
YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOU ARE YOUR MIND. THE CREDIT RATING AGENCY FITCH DOWNGRADED NEW JERSEY? THAT BRINGS ME TO MY NEW SEGMENT WHAT ARE YOU FRIGIN NUTS OVER THERE? DOWNGRADING AMERICA'S ONE THING BUT YOU DARE DOWNGRADE NEW JERSEY? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT STATE IS CAPABLE OF? (LAUGHTER) I KNOW, I LIVE THERE. REMEMBER BORN TO RUN WITH BRUCE SPRINGSTEIN SAYS THIS TOWN RUNS THE BONE FROM YOUR  BACK, A DEATH TRAP.
THE NEW JERSEY STATE SENATE WANTED TO MAKE IT THE STATE SONG. (LAUGHTER) RIP THE BONES FROM YOUR BACK. WHEN HE DECIDED TO CALL NEW JERSEY THE GARDEN STATE, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY Z THEY PAVED  THE WHOLE [BLEEP] THING OVER. TAKE THE CITY OF CAMDEN, CITY SOME OF THE WORST CRIME RATES WHAT DID THEY DO THEY CUT THEIR POLICE FORCE IN  HALF AND BUILT AN AQUARIUM SO THE CRIMINALS WILL HAVE A SHARK TANK TO DUMP BODIES IN, I DON'T KNOW. HOW DO YOU KNOW NOT THIS, FITCH. HAVEN'T YOU SEE NEW JERSEY'S TOURISM ADS.
IN NEW JERSEY 44 PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED IN A FEDERAL STING TODAY INCLUDING THREE  MAYORS, AND FIVE RABBIES. EVERYTHING FROM BRIBERY TO SELLING ORGANS.
NEW JERSEY AND YOU. PERFECT TOGETHER. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
