WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A SENIOR EDITOR FROM MOTHER JONES MAGAZINE. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "SONS OF WICHITA: HOW THE KOCH BROTHERS BECAME AMERICA'S MOST POWERFUL AND PRIVATE DYNASTY." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DANIEL SCHULMAN. SIR!... SIT, SIT. ENJOY, ENJOY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "SONS OF WICHITA." AND I AM, I AM VERY ANGRY WITH YOU. YOU'VE PRESENTED A BOOK HERE THAT'S VERY COMPLEX, THAT'S VERY WELL RESEARCHED. IT'S QUITE FAIR, AND THESE KOCH BROTHERS ALMOST SEEM HUMAN IN YOUR DEPICTION.
I APOLOGIZE.
Jon: HOW COULD YOU, SIR?
IT REALLY, IT'S A FASCINATING STORY OF THESE... I MEAN, THE TWO BROTHERS ARE SORT OF THE FAMOUS ONES. BUT, THERE'S FOUR OF THEM.
RIGHT. RIGHT. SO, I MEAN, THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS FAMILY IS YOU REALLY HEAR JUST ABOUT CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH. OF COURSE THERE ARE FOUR KOCH BROTHERS. AND WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THIS BOOK, I WAS YOU KNOW, THE POLITICAL PART OF THEIR STORY IS ALMOST THE LEAST INTERESTING PART OF IT.
Jon: RIGHT.
THESE BROTHERS DUKED IT OUT OVER CONTROL OF THE FAMILY COMPANY. IN ONE OF THEM, WHAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BARE-KNUCKLED BRAWLS, LEGAL BRAWLS IN HISTORY, AND THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT IT IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEIR DAD DIED IN 1967...
Jon: RIGHT.
BEQUEATHING THE FAMILY FORTUNE TO HIS SONS, YOU KNOW, CHARLES KOCH FINDS A LETTER AFTER HIS DEATH AND IT SAYS, YOU KNOW, BE KIND AND GENEROUS TO EACH OTHER, AND YOU KNOW, THIS MONEY CAN BE A BLESSING OR A CURSE. IT ENDS UP BEING BOTH BECAUSE THEIR INHERITANCE ENDS UP FUELING THIS NASTY, NASTY LEGAL WAR BETWEEN THE BROTHERS.
Jon: BUT IT'S ALMOST... YOU KNOW I, YOU READ ABOUT THEIR CHILDHOOD AND THE WAY THE FATHER... YOU KNOW, IT'S A DIFFERENT ERA, BUT THERE WAS ALMOST LIKE A DARWINIAN ETHOS IN THE FAMILY, LIKE THE DAD WAS SORT OF LIKE, WHO AMONGST YOU WILL BE STRONGEST? FOLLOW ME. LIKE IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY DUKE IT OUT AFTER HIS DEATH BECAUSE WHILE HE WAS ALIVE, THEY DUKED IT OUT, AS WELL.
THEY DID. I MEAN, FRED KOCH, THE PATRIARCH, WAS A JOHN WAYNE-ESQUE CHARACTER, VERY GRUFF, STAND-YOUR-GROUND GUY. HE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPETITIVE. AND, HE FOSTERED THAT SENSE OF COMPETITIVENESS IN HIS SONS. AN INTERESTING STORY THAT I HEARD WHEN I WAS REPORTING ON THE BOOK WAS THAT, YOU KNOW, THE CARETAKER FOR DAVID AND BILL, THE FRATERNAL TWINS, WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP, ACTUALLY  CARRIED BOXING GLOVES AROUND WITH HIM, BECAUSE THESE GUYS WOULD GET INTO SUCH BRUTAL FIGHTS THAT THEY WERE AFRAID THEY WERE GOING TO LITERALLY KILL EACH OTHER. SO...
Jon: OH, MY GOD. SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CARETAKER. THEY HAD MORE OF A CORNERMAN. IT WAS A CORNERMAN.
A CORNERMAN.
Jon: COMES OUT WITH A BUCKET. COMES OUT WITH A CHAIR. OBVIOUSLY NOW THEY ARE... HOW ARE THESE GUYS DIFFERENT FROM THE BIG-MONEY INDIVIDUALS WE'VE COME TO KNOW IN POLITICS, THE RICHARD MELON SCAIFE, SOROS, YOU KNOW, THE GUYS THAT WE'VE ALL BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO, SHELDON ADELSON, THROWING MONEY INTO POLITICS. WHAT MAKES THESE GUYS DIFFERENT AND MORE INTERESTING AND MAYBE EVEN MORE FORMIDABLE?
YOU KNOW IN SOME WAYS THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN PLAYING A VERY LONG POLITICAL GAME. FOR CHARLES KOCH, THIS GOES BACK TO THE '60s. IT'S BEEN A CAMPAIGN OF INSTITUTION BUILDING, METHODICALLY FUNDING ADVOCACY GROUPS, THINK TANKS, THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND AT THIS POINT THEY NOW REALLY HAVE WHAT YOU COULD CALL A SHADOW POLITICAL PARTY WITHIN TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. I MEAN, THEY WERE ABLE TO RAISE $400 MILLION IN THE LAST ELECTION...
Jon: RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW MUCH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE...
Jon: AND IT'S NOT, IT'S INTERESTING. IT'S NOT THEIR, IT'S NOT ALL THEIR MONEY.
IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW, THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER A LOT OF DONORS. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PROBABLY CONTRIBUTING THE MINORITY OF THE MONEY TO THESE POLITICAL EFFORTS. THEY'VE 300 OR MORE HIGH-NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS...
Jon: RIGHT.
WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THESE CAUSES.
Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK THEY WANT SO DESPERATELY TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS?
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO THEIR DAD, FRED KOCH, VERY, VERY PRIVATE GUY. AND ESPECIALLY AFTER HE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS A LEADER OF THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY, CONTROVERSIAL GUY IN HIS TIME. AND HE CAME UNDER SCRUTINY DURING HIS ERA. I THINK THAT CAUSED HIM TO BECOME QUITE PRIVATE. AND THAT RETICENCE HAS REALLY CARRIED OVER TO HIS FOUR SONS IN A MAJOR WAY.
Jon: BUT THESE GUYS DON'T REALLY FIT INTO ANY, YOU KNOW, AT FIRST THERE WAS THIS SENSE THAT THEY'RE KINDA WITH THE MORE PURE LIBERTARIAN STRAIN AND THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD THAT. BUT THERE'S A SCHISM WITH THAT AND THEY MOVE MORE TO THE REPUBLICANS NOW. WHAT, WHERE DO YOU SEE THEM SHAKING OUT?
YOU KNOW, WHAT, THEY WERE REALLY PART OF BUILDING THE LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENT OF THE 1970s, BUT HONESTLY, IT GOT A LITTLE BIT KOOKY. YOU HAD THE DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, YOU KNOW, NERDS IN THERE. YOU HAD ALL THESE KIND OF STRAINS. AND THE ANARCHISTS, THE DISAFFECTED SDS MEMBERS. AND WHAT THEY REALLY WANTED WAS TO LEGITIMIZE LIBERTARIAN IDEOLOGY. NOW, AS YOU REFERRED TO, THERE WAS A BIG CRACK UP IN THE LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENT IN THE 1980s. AND, THEY GRAVITATE MORE TOWARDS REPUBLICAN POLITICS. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE INTERESTING THING IS THEY'RE THOUGHT OF AS THESE REPUBLICAN POWER BROKERS, BUT ON A LOT OF KEY ISSUES THEY DON'T ALIGN WITH THE REPUBLICANS AT ALL. DAVID KOCH HAS COME OUT AND SAID HE'S PRO GAY MARRIAGE. THEY'RE PRO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. BUT YOU DO NOT...
Jon: BUT, THEY DON'T SPEND THEIR MONEY THERE, THOUGH.
THEY ARE NOT SPENDING THEIR MONEY THERE.
Jon: SO IS THIS REALLY ALL JUST ECONOMIC INTERESTS? IS IT PURELY... BECAUSE IN THE REALLY MORE PURE LIBERTARIAN, THEY'RE STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN, YOU KNOW, FOR PRO FREEDOM AGENDA, BUT THESE GUYS ONLY SPEND THEIR MONEY ON ECONOMIC ISSUES.
I THINK THESE GUYS ARE GENUINE IN THEIR BELIEFS, BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS.
Jon: I WONDER BECAUSE THEIR ECONOMIC AGENDA SEEMS TO HAVE SUPPLANTED WHATEVER THE REPUBLICAN ECONOMIC AGENDA WAS ANYWAY. THEY'RE REALLY ALIGNED ON THAT REGARD.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND, I'M NOT EVEN SURE THE REPUBLICANS ARE QUITE... I MEAN, YOU KNOW, CHARLES KOCH'S IDEAL GOVERNMENT IS REALLY NO GOVERNMENT. VERY LITTLE. YOU KNOW.
Jon: SOMALIA.
IF YOU TALK TO HIS LIBERTARIAN ALLIES FROM THE '70s, THEY'LL SAY HE WAS WHAT THEY CALLED AN ANARCHO- CAPITALIST, AND THAT MEANS HE BELIEVES THAT PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN HANDLE ALMOST EVERY FUNCTION OF SOCIETY, BASICALLYELIMINATING THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT. NOW, THAT IS NOT WHERE WE LIVE RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, THERE IS SO MUCH PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE, THAT SORT OF STUFF. I MEAN, THAT'S, THAT'S NOT THE U.S.
Jon: I LOVE THAT BECAUSE IT IS ALMOST AT ITS CORE, IT'S SUCH AN AN ELITIST VIEW BUT PORTRAYED AS A FREEDOM AGENDA BECUASE IT REALLY IS LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE MOST MONEY CONTROL THE ENTIRE AGENDA. IT'S ALMOST ANTI-DEMOCRATIC IN A WAY.
IN SOME WAYS THESE GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE WORST POSTER BOYS FOR, YOU KNOW, CHARLES KOCH IS AGAINST THE MINIMUM WAGE
Jon: RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE WELFARE STATE, BUT OBVIOUSLY THESE GUYS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A SINGLE SOLITARY MOMENT OF FINANCIAL INSECURITY IN THEIR LIVES.
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE ON $2 DAY WHEN THEY'RE MAKING $2 MILLION, YOU KNOW, AN HOUR.
Jon: THAT'S A GOOD GIG.
IF YOU CAN GET IT, IT IS A GOOD GIG.
IT IS A GOOD GIG. VERY WELL DONE.  EXCELLENT BOOK. "SONS OF WICHITA," IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. DANIEL SCHULMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
