(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. THE ACTRESS OLIVIA WILDE, STAR  OF THE NEW MOVIE "BUTTER" WILL  BE HERE. SHE'S GOING TO CHURN UP. . . SOME. . . EXCITEMENT. (LAUGHTER)  I HATE MYSELF. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A  CRISIS ROCKING THIS NATION.
A HUGE OUTCRY, MILLIONS  TALKING ABOUT IT, TWEETING,  FACEBOOKING ABOUT IT, IT'S GONE  VIRAL.
THE TWO SIDES ARE LOCKED  BASICALLY IN THIS LABOR DISPUTE.
Jon: A LABOR DISPUTE! YES, AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF  THE TRIANGLE SHIRTWAIST FACTORY  AND THE PINKERTON BOYS. A LABOR DISPUTE HAS ONCE AGAIN  TAUGHT AMERICANS ABOUT THE  IRREPLACEABLE VALUE OF WORKING  MEN AND WOMEN.
CHICAGO STANDOFF. TEACHERS NOW SAY THEY WILL NOT  BE BACK TODAY AS THEIR STRIKE  ENTERS ITS SECOND WEEK.
Jon: NOT THAT LABOR  DISPUTE. (LAUGHTER)  IRREPLACEABLE WORKING MEN! NOT LAZY PUBLIC SECTOR--  FATTENED ON GIFT APPLES AND  LOUNGING IN THEIR FACULTY  LOUNGES WITH THEIR CHALKY FINGERS AND MUGS! (LAUGHTER)  ALL OF WHICH PROCLAIM THEY TO BE  THE WORLD'S GREATEST TEACHER! THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE! (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I THINK I PULLED AN ABOUT MALL  MULL. (LAUGHTER)  I'M TALKING ABOUT REAL WORKERS!
2,000 WORKERS IN CHINA TOOK  TO THE STREETS. FOXCONN HAS FACED CHARGES OF  POOR WORKING CONDITIONS, LOW PAY  AND MANDATORY OVERTIME IN THE  PAST. THE FACTORY THAT WAS THE SITE OF  RIOTS REPORTEDLY MAKES CASES FOR  THE IPHONE 5.
Jon: OH, FRUIT, YOU CAN'T  ESCAPE MY BLADES OF NINJA. (LAUGHTER)  OH, FRUIT YOU ARE NO--  (LAUGHTER). SORRY, YOU WAS JUST PLAYING  FRUIT NINJA WHO-- WHOEVER MAKES  THESE DOES AN AWESOME JOB. I HOPE THEY'RE WELL PAID. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? YES, A LABOR DISPUTE THAT  AFFECTS AMERICANS.
THE N.F.L.'S REPLACEMENT  REFEREES LITERALLY DECIDE THE  OUTCOME OF AT LEAST ONE GAME.
THIS IS A CAR CRASH IN MOTION  HERE.
AWFUL! DISGUSTING! DISAPPOINTING!
I WAS HEARTBROKEN.
HEARTBROKEN.
IT IS TIME TO BRING THE REFS  BACK TO THE N.F.L.
Jon: YES! THE MEDIA HAS FINALLY TAKEN A  STAND ON AN ISSUE OF THIS DAY  AND SAID LET'S BRING OUR BOYS  HOME! (LAUGHTER)  BRING THEM HOME TO THE N.F.L. BECAUSE-- MR. GOODELL, TEAR DOWN  THAT WALL! (SPEAKING GERMAN)  LOOK, AMERICA FINALLY LEARNED  WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO QUICKLY  SET AL LABOR DISPUTE, A BLOWN OFF INTERFERENCE CALL AND AN  INTERCEPTION THAT NOT ONLY COST  THE GREEN BAY PACKERS A VICTORY  IT COST ONE UNNAMED AMERICAN WHO HAD TAKEN THE PACKERS WHILE  GIVING THE POINT $200 IN ONE  WEEK FOR ONE WEEK WEARING ONLY A  SEATTLE SEAHAWKS JERSEY AND A  THONG. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BY THE WAY, THAT IS CLEARLY  SOMEONE ELSE'S BODY. (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT--  (LAUGHTER)  IF THAT WAS-- HONESTLY, IF THAT  WAS A PICTURE OF ME IT WAS LOOK LIKE A GIBBON WEARING A JERSEY. (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T KNOW WHAT-- I DON'T KNOW  WHO HE GOT AS A STAND-IN BUT--  (LAUGHTER). I HAVE-- DO YOU KNOW-- I HAVE SO  MUCH HAIR ON MY ASS THAT BLUR  NEVER WOULD HAVE IN ANY WAY--  (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  ONLY ONE SIDE. THE OTHER SIDE IS RELATIVELY  LOSING HAIR. WHAT I DO IS I COMB IT OVER. (LAUGHTER)  BUT WHILE MOST AMERICANS  RIGHTFULLY TIE THIS MISSED CALL  AND GREEN BAY LOSS DIRECTLY TO  THE N.F.L. LABOR DISPUTE, SOME HAVE FOUND A DEEPER RESONANCE.
THAT WAS AN INTERCEPTION. THIS WAS NOT A TOUCHDOWN. AND, LIKE I SAID THIS MORNING,  WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE  TEMPORARY REFS JUST LIKE WE NEED  TO REPLACE THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  AND HAVE REAL REFS AND REAL  LEADERS FIX THIS--
Jon: WHAT THE HELL? HOW DID YOU COMBINE THE-- YOU  CAN TIE ANY SITUATION, I GUESS,  INTO THAT. "YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD JERRY  SANDUSKY IS GOING TO PRISON. BUT YOU KNOW THE PERSON REALLY  RAPING AMERICA'S CHILDREN IS  PRESIDENT OBAMA WITH HIS  UNFUNDED MANDATES." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOR MORE ON THE N.F.L. LABOR  DISPUTE WE GO NOW TO SENIOR  CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER OUTSIDE N.F.L. HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK. JOHN, WHAT IS THE STATUS RIGHT  NOW OF THE N.F.L. DISPUTE?
WELL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHO FAMILIES BOTH ALIKE IN  DIGNITY, ONE THE REFEREE, THE  OTHER THE LEAGUE OF NATIONAL  FOOTBALL IS LOCKED IN DISPUTE AGES OLD. OH FAIR REFEREES! (LAUGHTER)  SHIRTS BESTRIPES ARMS AKIMBO  WITH ONLY A FLAG AND WHEUS TOLL  EXAMINE DESPERATION AND FAIR N.F.L. BATTERED BUT UNBOWED LIKE  HENRI AT AGINCOURT FROM THIS DAY  TO THE ENDING OF THE WORLD! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT WE SHALL BE REMEMBERED. WE FEW, WE HAPPY FEW, WE BAND OF  BROTHERS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GOD. MY GOD. THAT'S--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I'M JUST-- I'M SORRY. IT JUST-- HOLY (BLEEP)! I WAS JUST--  (LAUGHTER). JOHN OLIVER, YOU HAVE ALMOST  OVERNIGHT IMPROVED  EXPONENTIALLY. (LAUGHTER)  JOHN OLIVER, JOHN OLIVER, YOU  MOVED ME.
YES, 'TIS I, JOHN OLIVER IN  THE FLESH. (LAUGHTER)  THE CLOWN PRINCE OF  CORRESPONDENTS, BOB YOUR ANKLE,  UP YOUR BUM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I HAVE TO SAY THOUGH,  IF I MAY, IT CERTAINLY-- IT  CERTAINLY LOOKS AND SOUNDS LIKE  YOU BUT SOMETHING'S OFF. YOUR FACE. SO SYMMETRICAL. YOUR COMPLEXION HAS LOST ITS  DEATHLY PALLOR. YOUR VOICE TODAY RICH AND  MUSICAL LIKE THE SONOROUS NOTES  OF AN OBOE.
AH! PRAISE FROM CAESAR IS PRAISE,  INDEED. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SEE, EVEN THAT. THERE IS JUST SOMETHING SO MUCH  MORE APPEALING ABOUT YOU! EVERY FACET IT'S-- I DON'T KNOW  HOW TO DESCRIBE IT, REALLY. IT'S--
OKAY. HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
Jon: OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD, IT'S PATRICK  STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AMAZING!
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. YOUR CORRESPONDENTS, EMBOLDENED  BY THE N.F.L. LABOR DISPUTE,  HAVE ALSO GONE ON STRIKE! UNTIL THEN, WE REPLACEMENT  CORRESPONDENTS-- MYSELF, PACINO,  GLENN CLOSE AND, AS ALWAYS, THE  INCOMPARABLE MANDY PA TIN KIN AS AASIF MANDVI-- WILL ATTEMPT TO  HOLD DOWN THE FORT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: IF I MAY, IF I MAY, I  BELIEVE I'VE DETECTED A BIT OF A  RUB IN THE STRIKE STRATEGY. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEM. (LAUGHTER)  YOU ARE AN INFINITELY SUPERIOR  SUBSTITUTE. YOU LOOK BETTER; YOU SOUND  BETTER. I KNOW THIS IS REMOTE. I'M PRETTY SURE YOU SMELL BETTER  AS WELL. (LAUGHTER)
YES, I SMELL PRETTY GREAT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MAY I? IS IT A HINT OF LAVENDER WITH A  GRACE NOTE OF CEDAR AND PERHAPS  A A BIT OF OCEAN SAND? IS THAT WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE?
IT'S AXE BODY SPRAY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WELL, THIS  CORRESPONDENT STRIKE MAY GO DOWN  AS THE LEAST EFFECTIVE ACTION IN  HISTORY. IF YOU ARE AN OPTION, I'M FIRING  ALL THESE GUYS RIGHT AWAY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  STRIKE OVER. STRIKE OVER. GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE, WE'VE  REACHED A SETTLEMENT.
Jon: NO SETTLEMENT. YOU DON'T WORK HERE ANYMORE,  OLIVER, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED  I TRADED UP MY '83 TOYOTA FOR A  MASERATI.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,  JOHN? WE WEREN'T ON STRIKE. THIS WAS JUST A JOKE! IT WAS A METAPHOR. I WAS JUST EMBODYING THE IRONY  OF THIS CURRENT N.F.L. LABOR  DISPUTE IN A BIT YOUR KNOW, LIKE  WE DO ALL THE TIME. I CAN DO SHAKESPEARE IF THAT'S  WHAT YOU WANT. HERE'S SOME HENRY THE LION  HEARTED. "NOW IS THE WINTER OF MY  DISCONTENT!"
Jon: NO, FORGET IT, FORGET  IT.
JOHN, LOOK, THE POINT IS,  YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK, YOU'RE NEVER  GOING TO GET SOMEONE LIKE SIR  PATRICK STEWART TO WORK HERE  PERMANENTLY.
ACTUALLY, I'D LOVE THIS JOB. (LAUGHTER)  IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE INCREDIBLY  EASY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: YES! THERE WE GO. THAT'S GREAT. BEAUTIFUL. WE'LL TAKE HIM!
OH, THAT'S GREAT. SO HOW MUCH DOES IT PAY.
OH, IT'S-- (WHIT PERKING)
PER DAY?
NO, PER YEAR.
NO (BLEEP)ING WAY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  I AM ON STRIKE!
YES! STRIKE! STRIKE! STRIKE!
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. JOHN OLIVER AND PATRICK STEWART.
