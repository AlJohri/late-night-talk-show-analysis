JANUARY 17, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST, LIAM NEESON. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT LIAM NEESON, HE'S THE STAR OF THE NEW FILM "THE GREY."  THE GRIPPING STORY ABOUT A COLOR TRAPPED BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT, AS YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY WAS THE MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. CELEBRATION AND THE 16th REPUBLICAN DEBATE. TWO EVENTS WITH WHAT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HAS A VERY SMALL CROSSOVER AUDIENCE. (LAUGHTER) NOW, FOX NEWS SUMMED UP THE STRANGE CONFLUENCE PERFECTLY, CUTTING AWAY TO THE DEBATE TO BOTH AN ENDURING MONUMENT TO DR. KING'S GREATNESS AND A  MYRTLE BEACH REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE SAND SCULPTURE WHOSE MORTAL ENEMY APPEARS TO BE HIGH TIDE. (LAUGHTER) IT'S LIKE MOUNT RUSHMORE FOR HERMIT CRABS! (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. NOW I KNOW A LOT OF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO WATCH THE WHOLE DEBATE AND MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO  WATCH OUR NINE MINUTES OF TALKING ABOUT IT SO FOR VIEWERS IN A HURRY HERE'S A SYNOPSIS OF  THE DEBATE. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. THAT IS PRETTY MUCH IN THE A NUTSHELL. THEY WERE ALL OVER EACH OTHER. IN FACT, THE GENERAL THEME OF THE EVENING WAS "EVERYBODY ON THIS STAGE TONIGHT IS AN (BLEEP)  HOLE EXCEPT FOR ME."
SENATOR SANTORUM, TODAY YOU SAID GOVERNOR ROMNEY IS GUILTY OF DISTORTING YOUR RECORD.
MITT, WE NEED FOR YOU TO RELEASE YOUR INCOME TAX.
THE ANALOGY THAT CONGRESSMAN PAUL USED WAS UTTERLY IRRATIONAL.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY TO CHANGE THAT WHEN YOU WERE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS?
YOU VOTED AGAINST RIGHT TO WORK!
CONGRESSMAN PAUL VOTED AGAINST THAT BILL.
GOVERNOR HUNTSMAN CALLED YOU A "PERFECTLY LUBRICATED WEATHERVANE ON THE IMPORTANT  ISSUES OF THE DAY." (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AT LEAST HE WAS PERFECTLY LUBRICATED. PERFECTLY LUBRICATED WEATHERVANE? EVEN THEIR INSULTS TO EACH OTHER SMELL OF RICH GUYS. AND YOU, SANTORUM, YOU'RE LIKE A GAZEBO MADE OF CEDAR WOOD. GOOD LUCK ON YOUR THIRD WINTER! (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. ALLOF COURSE, SOUTH CAROLINA IS A TAD MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN NEW HAMPSHIRE OR EVEN IOWA AND THE  QUESTION WAS WHO COULD DO THE BEST JOB OF APPEALING TO THE SOUTHERN CONSERVATIVE VOTER. MITT ROMNEY, YOU'RE THE FRONT-RUNNER. WOULD YOU TAKE A SHOT AT IT.
I WENT MOOSE HUNTING... NOT MOOSE HUNTING, ELK HUNT WITH FRIENDS IN MONTANA.
Jon: ACTUALLY IT WASN'T AN ELK, IT WAS A FAWN. WE WERE... (LAUGHTER). WE WERE AT A PETTING ZOO. (LAUGHTER) I DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT THE DAMN THING, I JUST WANT TO BE  PRESIDENT, THAT'S ALL I WANT. AND I KNEW I WAS GOING TO NEED ONE KILL ON MY RECORD BUT THOSE BIG BROWN EYES. I KILLED BAMBI IS WHAT I'M SAYING! I KILLED BAMBI BECAUSE MY FRIENDS WERE SHOUTING "NO PUSSIES IN THE WHITE HOUSE!"  I JUST... (LAUGHTER). I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME. BUT THE REAL STAR OF THE DEBATE WAS THE SOUTH CAROLINA AUDIENCE WHO MADE SOME REVEALING  APPLAUDTORY CHOICES.
SOUTH CAROLINA IS AT WAR WITH THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WHOO! WHOO! WAR AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT LED BY SOUTH CAROLINA! (LAUGHTER) THAT ALWAYS HAS A GOOD ENDING, RIGHT? I THINK I REMEMBER US CLAPPING FOR THIS IN A PREVIOUS INCARNATION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WOW. SO A FAINT HINT OF CIVIL WAR. (LAUGHTER) HOARY! WHAT DIDN'T THE AUDIENCE LIKE?
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER A GOLDEN RULE IN FOREIGN POLICY. DON'T DO TO OTHER NATIONS... (BOOS) ... WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN TO US. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: LET THE RECORD SHOW ON JANUARY 16, 2012, THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA BOOED  THE GOLDEN RULE. (LAUGHTER) BUT ONE MAN MANAGED TO BOTH WIN THE DEBATE AND PROVIDE A FITTING  TRIBUTE TO THE LATE MARTIN LUTHER KING.
SPEAKER GINGRICH, YOU RECENTLY SAID BLACK AMERICANS SHOULD DEMAND JOBS NOT FOOD STAMPS. CAN'T YOU SEE THAT THIS IS VIEWED AT A MINIMUM AS INSULTING TO ALL AMERICANS BUT  PARTICULARLY TO BLACK AMERICANS? (APPLAUSE)
NO. I DON'T SEE THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: HOORAY! YES, HOORAY FOR YOUR INABILITY TO COMPREHEND WHEN YOU'VE INSULTED BLACK PEOPLE! WE, TOO, FIND IT DIFFICULT! ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ALMOST THERE, NEWT, ALL YOU NEED IS A BIG FINISH THAT ENCASES YOUR CONFLATION OF BLACK PEOPLE AND  POVERTY IN A COVERING OF MELTED SANCTIMONY.
SO HERE'S MY POINT. I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN OF EVERY BACKGROUND HAS BEEN ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH  THE RIGHT TO PURSUE HAPPINESS AND IF THAT MAKES LIBERALS UNHAPPY I'M GOING TO FIND WAYS  TO HELP POOR PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO GET A JOB, LEARN HOW TO GET A BETTER JOB AND LEARN SOMEDAY TO  OWN THE JOB. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHEN WE COME BACK... THEY CAN'T HEAR ME BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU.
Jon: AND SO IT WAS THAT ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY NEWT GINGRICH SHARED HIS VISION OF AN  AMERICA WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE JUDGED NOT BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT BY HIM, NEWT GINGRICH. (LAUGHTER) AND HE FINDS THEM LAZY. (LAUGHTER) AND, BY THE WAY, SINCE WE'RE ASCRIBING MOTIVATIONS TO PEOPLE  WE DON'T KNOW, I WONDER HOW STATUE MARTIN LUTHER KING IS FEELING ABOUT ALL OF... WAIT, OH, HE'S ANGRY. OH, THIS IS NOT... (LAUGHTER) WOW. MARTIN LUTHER KING PREACHED NONVIOLENCE BUT STATUE MARTIN LUTHER KING KICKS MOTHER (BLEEP)ING ASS! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHE
