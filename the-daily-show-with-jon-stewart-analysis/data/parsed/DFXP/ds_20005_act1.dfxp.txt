FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. VERY GOOD SHOW TONIGHT THAT WE HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU. MY GUEST TONIGHT, ATUL GAWANDE, HE IS THE AUTHOR OF "BEING MORTAL: MEDICINE AND WHAT MATTERS IN THE END." MY GUESS IS THAT WOULD BE MEDICINE. BUT FIRST, THE WORLD BEEN A LITTLE UPHEAVALLY OF LATE SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD START THE WEEK SOMEWHERE THAT'S EXPERIENCING A BIT OF A DOWNHEAVAL. HONG KONG. WHERE LAST WEEK'S PROTESTS HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED FROM MASSIVE, ANTI-GOVERNMENT RALLY TO LISTLESS TEEN HANG SESSION. (LAUGHTER) WHICH IS SURPRISING AFTER DAYS LIKE THESE.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PACKED THE STREETS OF DOWNTOWN HONG KONG AS POLICE FIRED AS MANY AS 87 CANS OF TEAR GAS. DETERMINED DEMONSTRATORS SHIELDING THEMSELVES WITH UMBRELLAS AND SPAWNING THE SO-CALLED UMBRELLA REVOLUTION.
Jon: OH GREAT. THANKS, CHINA! (LAUGHTER) I'M HAVE TO CHANGE THE NAME OF MY NEW ELECTRO-HOUSE ALBUM. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME DESIGNING THAT COVER. VARIOUS COLORS AND THINGS. SO WHAT WAS THE UMBRELLA REVOLUTION PROTESTING, ANYWAY?
THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY CALL A FULL DEMOCRACY. THEY WANT THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO ELECT THEIR OWN LEADERS. THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING SAYS SURE, THEY CAN HAVE ELECTIONS BUT THEY CAN ONLY VOTE FOR CANDIDATES THAT HAVE BEEN PREAPPROVED BY BEIJING.
Jon: OH ALRIGHT WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE, I MEAN WHAT GOOD IS AN ELECTION IF ALL THE CANDIDATES ARE THE SAME? IT'S LIKE CHOOSING WHATEVER YOU WANT FOR BREAKFAST WHEN YOU'RE AT DENNY'S. WHAT, DO YOU GOT? THE ALL AMERICAN SLAM, THE LUMBER JACK SLAM, THE GRAND SLAM-WICH -- IT'S JUST, IT'S ALL EGGS, TOAST, AND MEAT SOAKED IN HUMAN MISSERY. THAT'S ALL IT IS. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER) PROBABLY GONNA GET A GIFT BASKET FROM ARBY'S AFTER THAT. HONG KONGERS WERE ALSO PROTESTING INCOME INEQUALITY, HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND UNION ISSUES. AND I THINK WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE HOW ROWDY THAT KIND OF THING CAN GET.
HONG KONG PROTESTS NOW REALLY PUT THE CIVIL BACK IN THE CIVIL OBEDIENCE.
THERE IS A VERY, VERY SORT OF COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE.
HOT DRINKS AND SNACKS.
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING AROUND COLLECTING GARBAGE AND RECYCLING WHEN THEY CAN.
CHINA-- CHINA, YOU'VE SURPASSED US ONCE MORE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. FIRST THE CHINESE BEAT US AT BUSINESS WITH ALIBABA. NOW THEY ARE DOING PROTESTS BETTER THAN US. THEY ARE BEATING US AT BOTH THE OCCUPY AND THE WALL STREET. IT'S NOT FAIR! EVEN THE POLICE HAVE BEEN MINDING THEIR MANNERS. HERE THEY ARE OFFERING HELPFUL SIGNAGE TO ALERT PASSERBIES THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE TEAR GASSED. VERY THOUGHTFUL, RIGHT? AND HERE IS AN OFFICER POLITELY GETTING THE ATTENTION OF AN OLDER GENTLEMAN. I DON'T IMAGINE THAT WAS SILLY STRING. EXCUSE ME, SIR. PARDON ME. THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE DO BETTER THAN CHINA. RICH, ENTITLED CELEBUTANTES TWEETING STUPID OUT OF TOUCH OPINIONS. THEY WILL NEVER TOP US THERE.
THE 22-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER OF HONG KONG'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE WAS ONLINE BRAGGING ABOUT HER TAX-PAYER FUNDED PURCHASES.
Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP]! GO ON.
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE BOUGHT AT LANE CRAWFORD FUNDED BY ALL YOU HK TAXPAYERS, HONG KONG. ACTUALLY, MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SAY ALL OF YOU SINCE MOST OF YOU HERE ARE PROBABLY UNEMPLOYED. WHAT KIND OF COMMUNISTS ARE THESE PEOPLE? EVEN PARIS HILTON IS LIKE TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH. BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW ARE THESE PROTESTS PLAYING IN THE MAINLAND OF CHINA?
THIS IS WHAT CHINESE VIEWERS OF CNBC SAW DURING ITS RECENT COVERAGE OF THE HONG KONG PROTESTS. ON BBC 2 THE SCREEN WENT TO BLACK. CHINESE AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING TO KEEP IMAGES OF THE PROTESTS IN HONG KONG OFF TV ON THE MAINLAND.
Jon: SO YOU JUST GO TO BLACK. YOU JUST-- PEOPLE WATCHING AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE OH. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN IF IT'S JUST A BLACK SCREEN, EVERY SHOW ON CHINESE TELEVISION IS A POTENTIAL LAST EPISODE OF THE SOPRANOS, IT JUST GOES TO BLACK. I BET WHEN THE SOPRANOS FINALE AIRED IN CHINA THEY WERE ALL LIKE OH, I GUESS TONY WAS SITTING DOWN WITH HIS FAMILY TO DISCUSS ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS. THAT'S A WEIRD ENDING. OF COURSE, WHEN IT COMES TO OFFICIAL OBFUSCATION CHINA'S GOT NOTHING ON THE MASTER. N TO THE ORTH, TO THE KOREA.
IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH SINCE KIM JONG UN HAS BEEN SPOTTED IN THE PUBLIC.
IT IS ASSUMED THAT HE IS IN POOR HEALTH OR IS HAVING HEALTH ISSUES. THE STATE RUN MEDIA HAS SAID THAT HE HAS QUOTE DISCOMFORT.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. DISCOMFORT. HERE'S MY TAKE, OL' KIM JONG UN WENT TO THE HOSPITAL, WITH A CANISTER OF AXE BODY SPRAY STUCK UP HIS ASS. (LAUGHTER) AND THE DOCTOR WAS LIKE WHAT'S THIS. AND KIM JONG UN'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW, I WAS FRESHENING UP AND I FELL. AND I CERTAINLY WASN'T TRYING TO PUT AN AXE BODY SPRAY UP MY ASS. AND THE DOCTOR IS LIKE WELL WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT ON THE FORM? AND THEN KIM JONG UN IS LIKE WELL DON'T FILL IT OUT. JUST PUT IT'S JUST DISCOMFORT. I'LL PAY CASH. IT'S FINE. ANY MORE SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS?
EXPERTS ARE SUGGESTING HE MAY HAVE GOUT.
SUFFERING FROM GOUT, DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION.
A REPORT NOW CLAIMING THE YOUNG RULER HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED RECOVERING FROM SURGERY ON TWO BROKEN ANKLES.
Jon: WOW. HOW BAD IS YOUR MEDICAL SYSTEM HAVE TO BE WHEN IT'S UP IN THE AIR WHETHER YOU HAVE GOUT, OR TWO BROKEN ANKLES. (LAUGHTER) YEAH, HE'S GOT A-- I DON'T KNOW, HE'S GOT [BLEEP] GOING ON WITH HIS FEET, I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER) GOUT, BROKEN ANKLES, MAYBE HE'S PREGNANT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL. SO THE SUPREME LEADER IS LAID UP DUE TO GOUTY, DISCOMFORTING, BROKEN ANKLES, PROBABLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
THE MAN WHO IS CONSIDERED TO BE SECOND IN COMMAND IN NORTH KOREA AFTER THE LEADER KIM JONG UN POPPED DOWN TO SOUTH KOREA FOR A LAST MINUTE VISIT. THIS VISIT WAS BOTH SURPRISING AND SIGNIFICANT. THE NORTH KOREANS AGREED TO ANOTHER RANK OF HIGH LEVEL TALKS FOR THE END OF THE MONTH OR THE START OF THE NEXT MONTH.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP]! NORTH KOREA, SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. KIM JONG UN DISAPPEARS WITH DISCOMFORT, AND NORTH KOREA GOES TO SOUTH KOREA TO START TALKING? I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THIS DISCOMFORT IS LESS MY TUMMY HURTS AND MORE OF A QUIETLY TOPPLED IN A COUP-ACHE. (LAUGHTER) SOMEWHERE KIM JONG UN IS YELLING THROUGH A BARRED DOORWAY AT ARMED GUARDS, COME ON. I BROUGHT YOU RODMAN -- WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FROM A CHILD KING? AS MENTIONED BEFORE, NORTH KOREA WROTE THE BOOK ON NONREPORTING THE NEWS. HOW IS THEIR MEDIA HANDLING IT?
SUPREME LEADER KIM JONG UN HAS BEEN SENT TO A FARM UPSTATE WHERE THE CLOUDS ARE MADE OF COOL WHIP AND HE CAN SPEND ALL DAY SHOOTING MISSILES AT THINGS AND MAKING LOVE TO DALLAS COWBOY CHEERLEADERS, ALL HAIL THE IMMORTAL KIM JONG UN.
Jon: SO I GUESS HE'S OKAY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
