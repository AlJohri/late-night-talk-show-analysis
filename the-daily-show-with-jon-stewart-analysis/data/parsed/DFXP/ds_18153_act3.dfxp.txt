Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A FINE ACTOR. HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED PRISONERS. >>WHY'D YOU RUN AWAY FROM ME THE OTHER NIGHT, MAN.
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE. YOU SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT HOUSE.
DOING SOME SHOPPING IN THE VALUE MALL LATELY.
YES. WHY, IS IT A CRIME TO SHOP THERE. CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY SUITS FROM BROOKS BROTHERS.
YEAH, NO. MAN, YOU BOUGHT CHILDREN'S CLOTHES.
Jon:  GUILTY. WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, JAKE GYLLENHAAL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS SO GOOD, I LIKE IT. LOVE IT. IT'S LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME.
THIS DOESN'T HELP. I THOUGHT THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. JUST TOO LOUD AND WARM. IT'S ALL OF US AGAINST YOU. WE'LL GET INTO THIS LATER. SO THIS FILM IS INCREDIBLE. THE PERFORMANCES, I LIE A LOT --
PEOPLE COME ON AND I'LL GO YOU'RE GREAT IN THIS MOVIE, IT'S ALL GREAT. IT'S ALL [BLEEP] BUT THIS IS TOTAL [BLEEP]
Jon:  NO.
BUT IT'S A TOUGH PLACE AS AN ACTOR. THERE MUST BE SOME RESIDUAL OF THIS THAT STAYS WITH YOU, NO, WHEN YOU DO A ROLE LIKE THIS, A FILM LIKE THIS.
THERE IS BUT I THINK THERE'S A PERVERSITY TO BEING AN ACTOR THAT PARTICULARLY IN MY CASE, DOESN'T ENJOY IT, I WOULDN'T SAY ENJOYS IT BUT IS DEFINITELY FASCINATED WITH THESE WORLDS. IN A WORLD LIKE THIS EVEN THOUGH IT IS FILLED WITH A LOT OF DARKNESS.
Jon:  DARK STORY, KIDNAP, TORTURE.
I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN AN IDEA OF SOMEONE THAT WAS A HERO THAT WASN'T IN THE LIKELY PLACE YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE. THERE'S A LOT SAID ABOUT THE KIDNAPPING AND THE STORY BUT WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT IS WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A FATHER, WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE A MAN, WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO DO YOUR JOB THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.
Jon:  TRAVEL IN THAT WORLD AND TRY AND CLEAN IT UP TO SOME EXTENT, TRY TO BE THE PERSON THAT YOU KNOW, HELPS ESTABLISH THAT.
YES.
Jon:  IT WAS ROUGH. THE MUSICAL NUMBER HELPS. [LAUGHTER]
THE THING ABOUT WORKING WITH HUGH JACKMAN --
Jon:  HA HA HA HA. HE JUST BREAKS INTO SONG.
I HAD A BEARD.
HERE WE GO.
BUT THERE'S JUST A SPOT. UNDER THE CHIN JUST LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE BIT OF GRAY. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THAT. [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT --
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY A THING. YOU'RE SAYING IT ON THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. [LAUGHTER]
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. [APPLAUSE]
I AM DORIAN GREY. I AM THE EMBODIMENT. YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN YOUR ATTIC JUST LIKE ME RIGHT NOW. COME ON GYLLENHAAL.
OH IT'S COMING, MY FRIEND. IT'S ON ITS WAY. WHEN YOU GET OLDER IT'S LIKE I HAVE DESSICANTS IN MY PANTS, I SUCKING ALL THE MOISTURE.
WE GOT FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM.
TO THE BOTTOM, MY FRIEND.
BUT THINGS ARE GOOD OTHERWISE.
EVERYTHING IS GREAT, YES.
SOMEONE WAS ASKING ME EARLIER IN THE AUDIENCE ABOUT BATMAN. WOULD YOU DO, BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BEN AFFLECK. I THINK HE WILL DO GREAT AS BATMAN. I'M NOT BOTHERED BY CASTING CHOICES.
THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH. [LAUGHTER] WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S SUCH A HULLABALOO. BECAUSE IT'S A MYTHIC CHARACTER. DO YOU REALLY WANT ME TO GO INTO THIS?
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR IDEAS AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY TO EXPRESS IT AND WE LIVE IN AMERICA WHERE THAT SHOULD BE AMERIDONE AND IT'S A GREATBE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ACTOR AND WHEN YOU GET TO PLAY THAT ROLE IT'S SUPER BAD [BLEEP] AND I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE SUPER BAD [BLEEP] IN IT.
Jon:  AS LONG AS BATMAN STILL EXISTS IN THE COMIC BOOKS.
YES.
AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT LIKE OH AND NOW BEN AFFLECK IS BATMAN IN ALL OF YOUR COMIC BOOKS. [LAUGHTER] WHY DOES ANYONE GIVE A [BLEEP] IT'S A MOVIE. IT BOGGLES MY MIND. HOW CAN DANNY DEVITO BE THE PENGUIN. WHO [BLEEP] KNOWS. THE PENGUIN'S NOT A PERSON.
I'M SPEECHLESS. I MEAN CASTING IS FOREVER A PART OF MY LIFE, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF MY CAREER. WHEN I'M CAST IN A ROLE I'M JUST PLAIN EXCITED. MOST OF THE TIME IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT, YOU KNOW, YOU GET YOUR JOB AND YOU TRY AND YGET ANOTHER ONE AND I THINK ASD AN ACTOR REGARDLESS HOW MUCH SUCCESS SOMEBODY'S HAD EVEN SOMEBODY LIKE MR. AFFLECK. CAN'T YOU CALL HIM BEN? THERE'S A HOLLYWOOD HIERARCHY.
Jon:  OH REALLY. >>LORD AFFLECK, I SALUTE YOU, SIR. IS IT WEIRD FOR AN ACTOR, I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THIS WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WERE KIND ENOUGH TO BE IN THE FILM THAT I WAS DOING SO THEY JUST LEAVE AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN THAT LITTLE DARK ROOM WHERE I COULD BE JUST RUINING EVERYTHING. IS THAT, DOES THAT RUN THROUGH EVERYBODY'S HEAD?
YES. THERE'S THIS STRANGE MOMENT AS AN ACTOR WHERE YOU THINK LIKE OH I'M CONTROLLING ALL OF THIS AND THIS ONE TAKE. AND IT'S LIKE IN THE BACK, BEHIND THE CAMERA EVERYBODY'S GOING LIKE OH HE THINKS HE'S CONTROLLING IT. AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY, IT'S A GREAT THING BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE MOVIE I DID, THIS IS WHERE I WORKED WITH THE DIRECTOR TWICE IN A ROW. WHAT I COULD SEE IS WHEN YOU MAKE A RELATIONSHIP IT'S ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU HAVE TO TRUST YOUR DIRECTOR. YOU GIVE THEM EVERYTHING, YOU THROW IT ALL OUT THERE AND THEY CUT IT TOGETHER AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRUST SOMEONE LIKE YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  HA HA. HERE'S THE NICE THING ABOUT ME. I'M ONLY DOING ONE MOVIE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.
I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOUR MOVIE.
Jon:  THE GUY BACK THERE DOING IT IS A MAESTRO. HE'S DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. PRISONERS, IT'S IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY. JAKE GYLLENHAAL.
