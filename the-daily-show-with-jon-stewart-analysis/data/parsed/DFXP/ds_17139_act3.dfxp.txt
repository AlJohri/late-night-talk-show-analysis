(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A FINE ACTOR. HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED COSMOPOLIS
HOW MANY BILLIONS DO YOU TWO REPRESENT?
SHE'S A POET. (LAUGHING) IS THAT WHAT SHE IS? I THOUGHT SHE WAS A SHIFFRON
A LITTLE I OF BOTH. DOES SHE LET YOU TOUCH HER PERSONAL PARTS?
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS TODAY. Jon: ARE THEY IN DARTH VADER'S PLANE? PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM ROBERT PATTINSON. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
NICE TO SEE YOU. Jon: OBVIOUSLY, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?
I HAD A JOKE. GOD DAM IT. I WAS ALL SET UP AND READY TO GO. NOW IT'S MEANINGLESS. I WAS GOING TO SAY... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WE'RE JUST A COUPLE OF GALS TALKING, ALL RIGHT?
THIS IS HOW YOU GOT ME ON THIS SHOW
Jon: EXACTLY. TELL ME EVERYTHING. THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE I CAN FEEL AWKWARD IN EVERY SITUATION.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE? HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH MY SHOW WE DON'T HAVE [BLEEP] FREEZER. (SCREAMING)
THAT COULD BE REALLY GROSS. Jon: DO YOU LIKE... WHICH IS YOUR PREFERENCE?
I'M TRYING TO AVOID EATING BECAUSE I'M GOING TO...
Jon: YOU HAVE GOTTEN TO BE A FAT [BLEEP]. YOU HAVE TO TIGHTEN IN THERE. YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW UP TO 138. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? IS EVERYTHING OKAY? I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPROACH THIS
Jon: THE ICE CREAM THIS IS A WEIRD THING ABOUT THESE INTERVIEWS. NOW I'M GOING TO SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT
Jon: NOT AT ALL MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IN MY LIFE IS I DIDN'T HIRE A PUBLICIST. IN EVERY AWKWARD INTERVIEW NORMALLY ACTORS GET EVERYTHING SCRIPTED
Jon: YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT WITH AN ANECDOTE. SO, I HEAR YOUR SUMMER IN FRANCE HAS BEEN LOVELY.
I'M GOING TO HIRE A PUBLICIST Jon: I THINK YOU SHOULD. I THINK YOU SHOULD. ALTHOUGH UNLESS YOU HAVE A TIME MACHINE...
EITHER WAY Jon: IS IT AWKWARD FOR YOU? DO WE HAVE THE FOOTAGE? WE HAD ON THIS SHOW THE PRESIDENT OF PAKISTAN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'VE HAD ON ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL AND HISTORICKING FIGURES. THIS IS WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE OUR SHOW TODAY. AND HALF OF THEM ARE LIKE OLD FAT GUYS WITH CAMERAS TRYING TO GET PICTURES OF YOU. IS THIS INSANITY FOR YOU?
NO, I MEAN I LOOKED AT THE LITTLE NOTE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, AND I WAS LIKE, JON, I  THINK YOU'RE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THIS SHOW IS ACTUALLY ABOUT AND  WHAT THE REAL ISSUES IN AMERICA ARE.
Jon: WHAT ARE THEY? I MEAN, I THINK IT'S LIKE... I MEAN TONIGHT MAYBE AT OTHER TIMES BUT TONIGHT IT REALLY IS A TWILIGHT SHOW NIGHT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: IT IS. THIS MAY BE... HOLD ON. AM I ON TWITTER RIGHT NOW? HASH TAG JACK ASS. HASH TAG OLD LOSER.
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA THOUGH. Jon: DON'T YOU THINK? LISTEN, THE LAST TIME I HAD A BAD BREAK-UP, BEN AND JERRY GOT ME THROUGH SOME OF THE TOUGHER  TIMES SO I THOUGHT YOU AND I COULD BOND OVER THIS AND TALK ABOUT IT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WAS THAT AN IMPRESSION OF YOURSELF?
Jon: THAT WAS ME AT 17 UNTIL ABOUT 38. THEN MY VOICE CHANGED AND I GOT MY VIRGINITY BACK. WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG AND YOU BREAK UP, IT'S POWERFUL AND IT FEELS LIKE THE WORLD IS ENDING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN THE WORLD ACTUALLY REACT THAT WAY, WHERE... IT'S INSANITY. HERE'S MY WISH FOR YOU. THAT YOU GET TO HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS IN PRIVATE, IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST. I REALLY ENJOY TALKING TO YOU. YOU'RE A NICE KID. THAT'S ALL. NOW WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT... I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I AM INTERESTD IN. CRONENBERG, AN AMAZING FILM MAKER, BUT I'VE NEVER MET THIS GUY. THIS GUY HAS GOT TO BE AN ODD DUCK
HE'S THE SWEETEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
Jon: I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES NOT TO GIVE AWAY THE PLOT, YOU GET A PROSTATE EXAM IN A  LIMOSINE
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GIVE AWAY THE PLOT. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE MOVIE ABOUT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. BUT IT'S A VERY KIND OF ECCENTRIC... IT'S ONE OF THE  ONLY THINGS I THINK I'LL EVER DO WHERE I CAN SAY I DON'T THINK  IT'S GOING TO BE MADE AGAIN AND IT HASN'T BEEN MADE BEFORE. REGARDLESS OF HOW PEOPLE SEE IT AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING NEW.
Jon: I THINK WHEN YOU ARE PART OF A POP CULTURE PHENOMENON, THE ABILITY TO DO  SOMETHING MORE ECCENTRIC MUST BE SOMEWHAT FREEING, I WOULD THINK
I THINK IT KIND OF MAKES IT MORE INTERESTING AS WELL. YOU SEE THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS. PEOPLE ARE COMING TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS, MOST OF THE TIME THEY HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS. IN SOME WAYS IT MAKES IT MORE INTERESTING I HOPE, I THINK.
Jon: I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, CRONENBERG, HE'S A MAN. IF I'VE NEVER TAKEN L.S.D. AND AREN'T PLANNING ON IT, JUST GO  SEE A CRONENBERG MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S A SIMILAR VIBE. IS THERE ANYTHING BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO GO, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY NOW THAT  EVERYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY TURNED OFF THE TV? AS SOON AS WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE MOVIE THEY JUST, "I'M  GOING TO GO MAKE A SANDWICH."
THERE IS ONE THING. IF ANY TWILIGHT FANS TUNED IN, I GENUINELY WANT TO MAKE COSMOPOLIS HAVE A HIGHER OPENING  WEEKEND THAN THE DARK KNIGHT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S ONLY RELEASED IN SIX CINEMAS. IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE.
Jon: TWILIGHT FANS YOU NEED TO START NOW.
BUY LIKE EIGHT TICKETS Jon: AND JUST SIT ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND MAKE SOME TYPE OF  TWILIGHT FAN JENGA. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST, MAN. I KNOW YOU'RE GOING THROUGH SORT OF A WEIRD THING RIGHT NOW. COSMOPOLIS OPENS IN NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES ON FRIDAY NATIONWIDE ON AUGUST 24. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
