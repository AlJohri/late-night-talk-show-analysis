WE'RE TALKING TO HUSAIN HAQQANI. SO YOU KNOW, WHY IS IT, THEN, THAT PAKISTAN -- IF ALL THEY ARE DOING IS -- THIS IS NOT -- TYPICALLY FOR AMERICA WE INVOLVE OURSELVES IN OIL-RICH LAND BECAUSE IT'S A FLUID WE ENJOY. [ LAUGHTER ] PAKISTAN IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION. WHY CAN'T PAKISTAN THEN JUST ALLY WITH RUSSIA OR CHINA OR THE SAUDIS OR SOME OTHER COUNTRY THAT WILL GIVE THEM FUNDING WITHOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF HAVING A LOT OF THEIR POPULATION HATING US? BECAUSE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT WITHIN PAKISTAN?
PAKISTAN HAS TRIED. THEY ARE CLOSE TO THE  SAUDIS, THEY ARE CLOSE TO CHINA. THE SOVIET UNION WAS NOT A POTENTIAL ALLY WITH PAKISTAN BECAUSE IT HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA BUT I THINK THAT THE PAKISTANI U.S. RELATIONSHIP HAS ENDURED BECAUSE GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN AMERICA FREQUENTLY. YOU HAVE A CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION EVERY TWO YEARS. YOU ELECT A NEW PRESIDENT, AND THEREFORE, ANYBODY WHO DOES NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY OF DOING BUSINESS, ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FIND SOMEONE IN YOUR POLITICAL FISYSTEM WHO SAYS THIS TIME WE NEED TO WORK WITH THESE GUYS FOR THIS ADVANTAGE. AND YOU DO NOT MAKE FOREIGN POLICY BASED ON LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS. IT'S BEEN MORE OF A MILITARY TO MILITARY RELATIONSHIP MORE THAN A PEOPLE TO PEOPLE RELATIONSHIP. I'D LIKE YOU TO BE WELCOME IN PAKISTAN BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN WELCOME YOU THERE AND I DON'T THINK YOU ARE COMING ANY TIME SOON BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING ANY TIME SOON, EITHER. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: AS MY PEOPLE SAY, THIS IS SOMETHING WE SAY AT HOLIDAYS NEXT YEAR IN PAKISTAN. MANY DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS. [LAUGHTER] THAT WHAT IS SO FRUSTRATING ABOUT A LOT OF THESE GEOPOLITICAL SITUATIONS. WE SEE IT IN IRAN, PAKISTAN, IN AMERICA, IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHERE THE REGIMES HAVE EMBARKED ON A COURSE THAT IS INCREDIBLY CORROSIVE OVER THE LONG-TERM THAT IS AGAINST THE WILL OF A GOOD MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD HEARTED AND WISH NOT TO CREATE THESE KINDS OF ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT ARE RELATIVELY POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
ABSOLUTELY. OF COURSE, YOU REMEMBER THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE AMERICAN ATTITUDE WAS FINDING STRONG MEN IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR PEOPLE ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. AGAINST COMMUNIST INFLUENCE. THERE WAS A FAMOUS SAYING AT THAT TIME THAT HE MAY BE AN SOB BUT HE IS MY SOB. I SAY THE PROBLEM IN HAVING YOUR SOB, IS AT THE END OF DAY HE'S STILL AN SOB. I THINK AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY NEEDS TO BE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED. THE WORLD IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR AMERICA TO SOLVE. IT'S A SITUATION FOR AMERICA TO UNDERSTAND. IF AMERICANS CAN UNDERSTAND OTHER COUNTRIES THEY MAY BE ABLE TO BUILD BETTER RELATIONSHIPS. I DON'T THINK PAKISTAN IS AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES AND I DON'T THINK OUGHT TO BE BUT THEY NEED A REALITY-BASED RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY BOTH UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WANT. PAKISTANIS HAVE A LEGITIMATE COMPLAINT THAT AMERICANS CHANGE WHAT THEY WANT.
Jon: AND WE'RE ALSO RAINING MISSILES FROM THE SKY.
AND RAINING MISSILES BECAUSE YOU THINK THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IS ELIMINATING THE TERRORISTS YOU ALREADY KNOW. I THINK THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS TERRORISTS STILL BEING CREATED WHICH WOULD BE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO STUDY, HAVE NO FUTURE AND HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS. THERE ARE SO MANY PAKISTANIS WHO HAVE HIGH EDUCATION BUT THEY WOULD RATHER COME TO NEW YORK AND DRIVE A  CAB THAN STAY BACK HOME. WHEREAS THE POLICY OF THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE BEEN, COULD BE, TO TRY TO CREATE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE EMPLOYED BACK HOME PRODUCTIVELY AND MAKE THEIR OWN COUNTRY SUCCESSFUL.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ELSE AT PLAY HERE ALSO RECOGNIZING THE LIMITS OF AMERICAN POWER. THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN CREATE THE CONDITIONS IN OTHER COUNTRIES FOR DESIRED RESULTS IS A FOOL'S ERRAND IN MANY REGARDS, AND WHETHER IT BE THROUGH MILITARY POWER OR SANCTIONS OR ECONOMIC -- THE WORLD IS. EELIER THAN WE CAN GET OUR HANDS AROUND IT AND WE IN SOME WAYS MAKE IT WORSE BY INSINUATING OURSELVES INTO POLICIES AND SITUATIONS THAT WE HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN AND NOT TO OUR ADVANTAGE.
YOU CANNOT REENGINEER THE WORLD. YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. AND IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALLIES THOSE ALLIES SHOULD BE PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH YOUR VALUES AND WITH WHOM YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. EVEN IF IT'S AN INTEREST-BASED RELATIONSHIP IT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR FOR BOTH SIDES. MY SECOND PLUG FOR THE BOOK. THERE ARE MANY EPISODES WHERE PAKISTANI LEADERS COME TO AMERICAN LEADERS SAYING MY PEOPLE HATE AMERICA BUT I LOVE YOU. I WANT YOUR ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO STAY -- THAT ONLY CREATES SOME SORT OF SEMBLANCE OF A RELATIONSHIP, SOME COOPERATION BUT DOWN BELOW THE HATRED FESTERS. THE WAY TO CHANGE IT WOULD BE TO HAVE A LONGER TERM VIEW OF THE WORLD. THERE'S 193 MEMBERS OF UNITED NATIONS. YOU CAN'T HAVE A POLICY OF HOW TO REENGINEER EACH ONE OF THEM. WHEN I WAS AMBASSADOR, JON, WHEN I USED TO --
Jon: DID YOU JUST THROW THAT AT ME? I THINK YOU SAID WHEN I WAS AN AMBASSADOR AND STEPPED BACK FOR A SECOND AND SAID, JON.
I'M LEARNING THINGS FROM YOU. I WATCH YOUR SHOW.
Jon: I LIKE THIS. IT'S GOOD.
I SAW GENERAL ALADIN ON  YOUR SHOW SO AT LEAST I'M DOING BETTER THAN HE IS.
Jon: YOU ARE. >>WHENEVER I MET AMERICANS, THE FIRST QUESTION THEY WOULD ASK ME: WHAT CAN WE DO FOR PAKISTAN. I FELT LIKE SAYING TO THEM, YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU ASK ME WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR MY COUNTRY WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MY COUNTRY? A LITTLE BIT OF MORE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOING ON? AND THEN FIGURE OUT WHAT MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A PATRONIZING ATTITUDE YOU ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE ANGER AND YOU MAKE PEOPLE FEEL THAT YOU ARE CONDESCENDING TOWARDS THEM.
Jon: IT'S A NICE POINT. I'M OF THE  MINDSET YOU CANNOT CONTROL HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW YOU. YOU CAN ONLY CONTROL YOUR INTENTION AND ACTIONS. IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD POLICY FOR A LONG TIME IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD TO USE AMERICA TO STIR UP SENTIMENT AGAINST TO HELP CONSOLIDATE POWER. IN THE SAME WAY THAT OBAMA HAS DRONE STRIKES AND ALL THAT AND THEY DECRY IT IN THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT AND THEY ARE THE ONES AT TIMES CALLING ON THE PHONE AND SAYING CAN YOU HELP US GET THIS ONE GUY OR THIS OTHER GUY OR BEING BRIEFED ABOUT IT? IT GOES BOTH WAYS. THE OTHER SIDE IS THAT THE AMERICANS CAN ALWAYS TURN AROUND AND SAY WE WOULDN'T BE USING THE DRONES. I HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS THEY USE THE DRONES. I DO UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT. THEY WOULD SAY WE WOULDN'T BE USING THEM IF YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN BACKYARD, YOU IF YOU DO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP FOR YOU. BUT WHILE MAKING THAT ARGUMENT THE AMERICANS DON'T TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY.
Jon: WOW DID THAT SUM US UP. [ LAUGHTER ] [ L
JON IN AFGHANISTAN FOR EXAMPLE A SCHOOL BEFORE AMERICANS ARRIVED A BLACKBOARD, CHALK A TEACHER AND A FEW BOOKS. THE TALIBAN THREW THAT OUT BUT WHEN THE AMERICANS ARRIVED THEY SAID THE IDEA OF A SCHOOL IS IT SHOULD BE A BIT LIKE A GOOD SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY, A BASKETBALL COURT, THANK GOD THEY DIDN'T INSIST ON HAVING A PROM. YOU SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS, AMERICANS AFTER A LITTLE WHILE SAY WHY ARE WE WASTING OUR MONEY THERE? THE LOCAL PEOPLE START WONDERING DO WE REALLY NEED TO SPEND ALL THIS ON THIS? WHY NOT POCKET SOME? THERE'S A LOT OF CORRUPTION ENCOURAGED AND THE RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU WANTED. AFTER A FEW YEARS, THE AMERICANS DON'T LOSE WARS BUT THEY LOSE INTEREST. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LOOK AT YOU. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
THANK YOU.
Jon: HUSAIN HAQQANI. "MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
