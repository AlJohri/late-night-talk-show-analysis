[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM HADI AL BAHRA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION. WHAT, WHAT IS THAT? AND IS THAT -- BECAUSE IT IS, WE'RE AWFULLY CONFUSED. AND BY THE WAY, SORRY FOR DESTABILIZING THE WHOLE REGION. BUT WHAT IS THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION? WHAT IS IT MADE UP OF?
THE SYRIAN NATIONAL COALITION IS SIMPLY PROUD SYRIANS WHO  SEEK THEIR JUSTICE TO REGAIN THEIR RIGHTS, THEIR FREEDOM, AND TO HAVE THEIR COUNTRY WITH DEMOCRATIC RULERSHIP.
Jon: YOUR GOAL IS NOT JUST THE DEFEAT OF THIS NEW TERRORIST GROUP, THIS ISIL, THIS ISIS. WHATEVER THEY CALL THEMSELVES. YOUR GOAL IS ALSO TO GAIN JUSTICE FROM ASSAD.
IT IS TRUE.
Jon: YES.
ASSAD IS THE SOLE CAUSE OF  TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IN THE AREA. THIS HAS BEEN SINCE THE 80S SINCE THE INVASION OF LEBANON BY THE SYRIAN ARMY. SINCE THE PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN FORCES IN IRAQ. THE ORIGIN OF ISIS ORGANIZATION, IT WAS THE STATE, THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND IT WAS CARRYING TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICAN FORCES IN IRAQ AT THAT TIME. AGAIN HE INVESTED AND REBUILT THIS SAME ORGANIZATION TO TERRORIZE THE SYRIAN PEOPLE NOW IN ORDER TO BLOCK THEIR FREE MOVEMENT FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.
Jon: ASSAD DID THAT. BECAUSE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ISIS IS THAT THEY WERE FIGHTING ASSAD. THAT THEY WERE, ALONG WITH THE AL-NUSRA FRONT AND THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY WERE ALL FIGHTING TOGETHER, OR NOT NECESSARILY TOGETHER BUT TO TRY TO DEFEAT ASSAD.
OPPOSITE.
Jon: OPPOSITE.
ASSAD NEVER FOUGHT ISIS. ISIS NEVER FOUGHT ASSAD. SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR AND THE START OF THE PRESENCE OF ISIS INSIDE SYRIA. ACTUALLY, ISIS FOUGHT ONLY THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY. AND ASSAD HAS BOMBED, CARRIED THE AIR STRIKES  AGAINST THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY WHILE LEAVING TOTALLY ISIS FORCES OUT. GO GOOGLE IT OUT. SEE HOW MANY AIR RAIDS AGAINST ISIS CARRIED BY ASSAD'S REGIME SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR. YOU'LL FIND NOTHING. ALL THE STRIKES ARE AGAINST CIVILIANS, AGAINST PEOPLE INSIDE ALEPPO, USING TNT BOMBS, AND USING EXTREME VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE.
Jon: I'M A LITTLE SAD WE DON'T KNOW THAT HERE AND THAT WE COULD GOOGLE IT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW IT. THAT'S A LITTLE SAD. SO IF, WHY WOULD ASSAD WHO IS ESSENTIALLY, THIS IS THE ALAWITE KINGDOM, AND HE IS SUPPORTED BY IRAN. WHY WOULD HE UNLEASH A SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. WOULDN'T THEY BE HIS MORTAL ENEMY?
NO. HE WANTED FROM THE START OF THE SYRIAN REVOLUTION. HE HAD A STRTEGY AND PLAN. HE WANTED THE FREE WORLD TO  SEE THAT IT'S ONLY A CHOICE BETWEEN AN EVIL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AND AN EVIL DICTATORSHIP. AND HE ASSUMED THE WORLD WOULD CHOOSE THE LESSER OF THE TWO EVILS, AND THEY WOULD CHOOSE ASSAD TO COOPERATE WITH. LUCKILY THE FREE WORLD REFUSED TO DO THIS, AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE GAME AND THEY STOOD BY THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
Jon: ARE YOU CONCERNED. WHAT CHANCE, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE SYMPATHIES OF THE WORLD ARE WITH THIS COALITION OF PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT FREEDOM, THEY JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE, THEY JUST WANT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES. HOW DO YOU COMBAT, ASSAD IS BACKED BY IRAN. AND IN SOME WAYS BACKED BY RUSSIA. ISIS, ISIL IS BACKED BY MAYBE ASSAD. MAYBE THEY'RE GETTING MONEY FROM SOME OF THE OTHER MORE FUNDAMENTALIST REGIMES IN THE AREA. HOW IS A GROUP LIKE THIS GOING TO DEFEAT THEM AND CREATE SOMETHING STABLE?
MAINLY BY OUR WILL AND OUR PATIENCE. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF OUR KIDS, OF OUR GRAND DAUGHTERS AND SONS. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THEM SINCE 40 YEARS. AND THE WORLD HAS KEPT SILENT. NOBODY MOVED. THEY MOVED ONLY AGAINST ISIS WHILE THEY DIDN'T MOVE AND DO ANYTHING FOR ASSAD. BUT WE THE PEOPLE OF SYRIA WILL CARRY ON OUR FIGHT AND WILL FIGHT UNTIL WE WIN BACK OUR FREEDOM AND WILL ACHIEVE OUR QUEST INTO A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: HOW WOULD YOU -- AND I WISH YOU VERY WELL WITH THAT. WHAT DO YOU SAY, SO NOW A COLLISION HAS FORMED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO STRATEGIC AIR STRIKES THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL WEAKEN ISIS. WILL THEY WEAKEN THEM TO THE EXTENT THAT -- IS THIS SOME SORT OF ROUND ROBIN? DOES THE FREE SYRIANS HAVE TO FIGHT AND DEFEAT ISIS AND THEN TAKE ON ASSAD? BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THE COALITION IS UNWILLING TO UTILIZE THEIR POWER AGAINST ASSAD.
WELL IT'S UH, OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS, THEY HAVE TO KNOW WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TWO FRONTS. WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ISIS AND THE REGIME, ASSAD REGIME AT THE SAME TIME WITH VERY LITTLE HELP OF THE WORLD.  WE CAN NOT CARRY ON THE FIGHT OF TWO FRONTS AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER FREE WORLD.
Jon: YOU ARE HERE FOR THE U.N. MISSION. ARE YOU GETTING THE HELP THAT YOU THINK YOU NEED AND THAT YOUR PEOPLE DESERVE?
I THINK THAT THE WORLD HAS STARTED TO MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT'S NOT TO OUR EXPECTATION AS OF YET. BUT I THINK SLOWLY IT WILL BUILD UP TOWARDS THAT DIRECTION. THEY NEED TO NOTICE THAT THEY CANNOT ELIMINATE TERRORISM BY ONLY MILITARY OPERATIONS. IT HAS TO BE MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN MILITARY OPERATIONS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SOCIAL, POLITICAL PROGRAM.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU NEED TO PROVIDE A VISION FOR POLITICAL LIFE FOR ALL OF THE REGION IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S THE FASCINATING PART. SO LET'S, CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT?
SURE.
Jon: WE WILL COME BACK AND THEN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT COULD WORK THERE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK AMERICA THOUGHT THEY TRIED IN IRAQ, WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL WITH IT. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING IN AFGHANISTAN, WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL WITH. SO WHAT A WORLD LIKE THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE, I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT, TO DELINEATE. ALRIGHT, SO WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. HADI AL-BAHRA. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
