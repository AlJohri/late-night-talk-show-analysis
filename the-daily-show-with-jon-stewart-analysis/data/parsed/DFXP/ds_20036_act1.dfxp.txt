FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GREAT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, WRESTLING STAR AND ALL-AROUND GREATEST GUY IN THE WORLD, MICK FOLEY IS GOING TO BE JOINING US TONIGHT. HE'S GOT A MOVIE, "I AM SANTA CLAUS". LITTLE DOCUMENTARY THERE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT WE'LL BE EXCITED TO TALK TO MICK AGAIN. BUT FIRST! AHHH! (BLEEP) FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS, AMERICA HAS BEEN FORCED TO ASK ITSELF SOME VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAY WE FORCED OTHER PEOPLE TO ANSWER SOME DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. (LAUGHTER) FOR A COUNTRY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS MORAL IDENTITY, IT HAS BEEN A TIME OF GREAT INTROSPECTION, ONE THAT I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE ENDS NOW, MOTHER (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER) BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? THE ROYAL FAMILY WAS IN TOWN, AND I FINALLY UNDERSTAND WHY ENGLAND CLINGS TO THIS ANTIQUATED RELIC OF A MORE PRIMITIVE TIME. BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY, THEY ARE SHINY, AND THEY ARE MORE FUN TO LOOK AT THAN THE SHAME THAT LIVES INSIDE OF US ALL! (LAUGHTER) JOIN ME, WON'T YOU? AS WE EMBARK ON A WONDEROUS JOURNEY WE CALL... WILL AND KATE'S FORCED RECTAL-FEEDING FREE AMERICAN ADVENTURE! (LAUGHTER) JUST LOOK AT THE EXCITEMENT THEY'VE BROUGHT TO OUR CITY.
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WAS AGLOW IN UNION JACK COLORS.
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING CHANGED THEIR COLORS FOR THEM.
I KNOW. YES.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THESE TWO?
Jon: THEY LIT UP THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING FOR THE ROYAL COUPLE! THEY ONLY DO THAT FOR THE SPECIAL-EST OF OCCASIONS! LIKE CANADA DAY. AND ALICIA KEYS RECORD RELEASE AND THE GRAND OPENING OF THE GRILL INSIDE OF THE BUILDING. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THOSE TWO? I ASSUME THE ROYAL COUPLE SPENT THEIR TIME IN NEW YORK LIKE ANY OTHER TOURISTS. HIT UP THE M&M STORE, THEN SPEND THE REST OF THE TRIP WATCHING RERUNS OF "FRIENDS" IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM BECAUSE A HOMELESS GUY CALLED YOU A WHITE DEVIL. (LAUGHTER) OR, OR DID THEY KICK THINGS OFF ANOTHER WAY?
PRINCE WILLIAM MEETING WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
KATE AS YOU CAN SEE, STAYED IN NEW YORK WHERE SHE VISITED WITH A CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT CENTER IN HARLEM.
DID SOME ARTS AND CRAFTS, APPARENTLY WRAPPED SOME CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
Jon: YES! BECAUSE WHAT TRIP TO AMERICA IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A... REINFORCEMENT OF OUR TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES. COME ON, MAN! WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY PRESIDING OVER AN INSTITUTION THAT SEEMS SEVERAL CENTURIES OUT OF TOUCH, MAYBE LET THE WOMEN TALK POLITICS AND THE GUYS CAN DO ARTS AND CRAFTS WITH THE CHILDREN. COULD THAT BE SOMETHING? BUT STILL, SEEING A REAL LIVE PRINCESS MUST HAVE BEEN THRILLING FOR THOSE LUCKY KIDS. THEY SAW HER AND THEY SHOUTED "PRINCESS!" AND THEY WERE SO EXCITED. AND THEN ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATORS SAID THEY THEY ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE THE PRINCESS FROM "FROZEN." (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S ADORABLE! AND RIDICULOUS. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, IF SHE WERE ELSA, SHE'D BE FOLLOWED AROUND BY SOME PALE, HAIRLESS LIVING SNOW -- (APPLAUSE) ♪ LET IT GO...♪ NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. ARE WE GOING TO GET TO SEE THE DUCHESS WRAP SOME PRESENTS? WELL, I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS! NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. OF COURSE, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE DUCHESS WRAP PRESENTS RELUCTANTLY.
KATE SHOWED OFF HER GIFT WRAPPING SKILLS WHILE GETTING A LITTLE TASTE OF NEW YORK'S CHARM.
KEEP WRAPPING!
Jon: WHAT! THAT IS THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE THROWING SHADE AT HER SUPERVISOR! THAT'S ONE OF THESE -- SURE, I'LL KEEP (BLEEP)! WE'VE GOT TO GIF THAT OR GIF THAT OR WHATEVER YOU GUYS CALL ON THERE. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, FOR GET ABOUT THAT.  MEME IT. LET'S MEME IT! YEAH, THERE YOU GO! WHEN ANOTHER GIRL TEXTS MY BAE ON DATE NIGHT -- I'M LIKE -- WHATEVER. WHATEVER THIS EXPRESSION IS SHE'S MAKING IN THE PICTURE. OF COURSE, EVEN WITH ALL THAT HARD WORK, THE ROYALS MADE TIME FOR SOME FUN AND GAMES.
THE NBA AND THE BROOKLYN NETS WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE TO BARCLAYS CENTER FOR THEIR FIRST NBA GAME. LET'S PLEASE GIVE THEM A WARM BROOKLYN WELCOME!
Jon: SIT DOWN YOU BIG-HEADED (BLEEP)! (LAUGHTER) YEAH. THAT IS OUR TRADITIONAL GREETING. NOW, KATE AND WILLIAM MAY NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT BASKETBALL BUT THEY DO KNOW ROYALTY.
KING JAMES SCORING BIG FOR THE CAVALIERS. BEFORE MEETING WITH THE ROYAL COUPLE POST-GAME LEBRON PUTTING HIS ARM AROUND KATE FOR PHOTOS. AND, YES, THE MUCH-ANTICIPATED MEETING BETWEEN BRITISH AND BROOKLYN ROYALTY TOOK PLACE -- BEYONCE AND JAY-Z GREETING WILL AND KATE, COURT SIDE.
OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! THEY'RE GOING TO TOUCH! THEY'RE GOING TO TOUCH. THEY'RE GOING TO TOUCH! LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY TOUCH. CONTACT IS IMMINENT! OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THEIR HANDS ARE TOUCHING! THEIR HANDS ARE -- (LAUGHTER) THAT -- THAT'S IT? ANYBODY ELSE EXPECT A BEAM OF LIGHT BRIGHTER THAN A THOUSAND SUNS? MAYBE A GENIE RIDING A UNICORN INTO A SEA DIAMONDS? OR MAYBE WHEN THEY ALL HOLD HANDS TOGETHER THEY FORM SOME SORT OF SEXY VOLTRON. MAYBE? DON'T ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME! DON'T ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME! BUT PERHAPS THE MOST GENUINELY TOUCHING MOMENT OF THE ROYALS' VISIT CAME WHEN THEY MET SOME "REAL" NEW YORKERS.
THEY WERE TREATED TO LIVE MUSICAL, DANCE, AND STORY-TELLING PERFORMANCES.
SO I TOLD MY FATHER WHAT HAPPENED.
THE COUPLE, SO MOVED BY 22-YEAR-OLD STEVEN PRESCOD'S STORY, THAT PRINCE WILLIAM GAVE HIM HIS PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER.
Jon: PLEASE, JUST CALL. ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS CALL. IT'S JUST -- IT'S ZERO, AND THEN THE COUNTRY CODE, AND THEN JUST PRESS THE NUMBER 3. FOR MORE ON WILL AND KATE'S EAST COAST VISIT, WE GO TO OUR SENIOR ROYAL WATCHER JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA! THANKS FOR JOINING US! JESSICA, WHAT AN EXCITING TIME.
YEAH, SO EXCITING.
Jon: WHAT AN EXCITING TIME. WHAT'S THE BIG TAKE WAY FROM THE ROYAL COUPLE'S TIME HERE?
SERIOUSLY, JON? LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW?
Jon: WHAT NO, I DON'T. I'M ASKING YOU. JESSICA, WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR ARMS FOLDED, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
BECAUSE, JON. LOOK AT THEIR ITINERARY. N.B.A. GAME, HARLEM, THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: OKAY. UH-HUH. UH-HUH.
JON, THE ROYALS CAME HERE LOOKING FOR A BLACK FRIEND.
WHAT? JESSICA, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. WHY --
WHAT? JON, IT'S THE ULTIMATE GET WHEN YOU'RE IN THE UPPER CLASS. THE RAT PACK HAD SAMMY DAVIS JR. "THE LOVE BOAT" HAD ISAAC. SERIOUSLY, YOU THINK KIM JUNG UN LIKES DENNIS RODMAN FOR HIS PERSONALITY? (LAUGHTER) ALSO, JON, WHAT'S AN OREO WITHOUT THE CHOCOLATE COOKIES? JUST A GROSS WHITE JIZZ QUARTER. JUST --
Jon: NOT EATING THOSE ANYMORE.
HMM MMM!
Jon: BUT, JESSICA, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THEY HAVE BLACK PEOPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
YEAH, JON, THEY HAVE FOOD THERE, TOO, BUT NO ONE'S EXACTLY RAVING ABOUT IT. JON, THEY WENT TO A ONE-MAN SHOW. EVEN MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULDN'T SIT THROUGH SOME DUDE'S ONE-MAN SHOW. THEY WERE IN TOWN FOR THREE DAYS, THEY SAW MORE BLACK PEOPLE THAN I DO, AND I LIVE IN THE APOLLO THEATER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU LIVE IN THE APOLLO THEATER?
YEAH, JON, IT'S RENT-CONTROLLED.
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
BUT, LOOK, THE TIMING OF THEIR TRIP IS PERFECT. THEY SAW JUST HOW PISSED OFF BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND KNEW THAT IT WAS JUST TIME TO POUNCE. I MEAN, LOOK AT THE SHIRT WILLIAM WORE IN BROOKLYN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JESSICA, I DON'T UNDERSTAND, THOUGH, WHY YOU SEEM BOTHERED BY ALL THIS. DID YOU, LET'S BE HONEST, DID YOU WANT THEM TO PICK YOU?
NO, OKAY, LOOK, I JUST WANTED THEM TO WATCH MY ONE-WOMAN SHOW JESSICA WILLIAMS IN WILL AND KATE PLUS MATE.
Jon: I'M SORRY THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT.
I KNOW, ME, TOO.
Jon: JESSICA, IF YOU WANT I'LL HANG OUT WITH YOU.
WHAT? EW NO, YOU'RE, LIKE, 60 AND YOU LIVE IN NEW JERSEY.
Jon: WHAT?
SORRY MR. DRUMMOND, KEEP FISHIN'.
Jon: THANK YOU, JESSICA. JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY. BUT YOU LIKE ME!
NO.
Jon: NO, YOU LIKE ME! YOU LIKE ME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
