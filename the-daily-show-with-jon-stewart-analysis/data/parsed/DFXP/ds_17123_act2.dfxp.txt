THE KIND OF TELEVISION BLACKOUT FOR 20 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Jon: SO IF YOU ARE A DIRECTV CUSTOMER NOT WATCHING TONIGHT, IT'S NOT  BECAUSE OF RAIN CLOUDS PASSED IN FRONT OF THE SATELLITE. [BLEEP] IT IS DARK. VIACOM, DIRECTV WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU GOT AD CAMPAIGNS BLAMING EACH OTHER FOR TAKING THE SHOWS AWAY. TELLING PEOPLE TO RISE UP AND DEMAND IT LIKE IT'S SOME KIND OF BASIC CABLE ARAB SPRING. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. IT'S NOT. NONE OF THIS MATTERS. NONE OF THIS IS INDISPENSABLE, DO YOU UNDER-- DO YOU REMEMBER OPRAH? EXACTLY. SHE WENT OFF THE AIR AND THREE DAYS MILLIONS OF VIEWERS ARE LIKE OH NO WHAT ARE WE GOING DO. AFTER DAY FOUR PEOPLE ARE LIKE WHO IS THIS-- I LIKE THE CUT OF HER SHOE. AND THEN THERE'S THIS.
