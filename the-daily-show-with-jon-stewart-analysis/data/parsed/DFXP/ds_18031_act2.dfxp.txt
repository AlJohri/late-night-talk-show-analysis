(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. AS WE ALL KNOW, OF OUR CONGRESS'  TWO HOUSES THE LOWER HOUSE THE  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS A DUMPING GROUND FOR MORONS AT  WHICH ANY [BLEEP] CAN GET  ELECTED. TO GET ELECTEDDED TO THE UPPER  HOUSE YOU HAVE TO BE AMONG THIS  NATION'S MOST REASONED AND REVERED [BLEEP]. WHO KEEP VOTING YEAR AFTER YEAR  TO CONTINUE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS  THE RULES OF THE SENATE.
YOU KNOW THAT ONE FRIEND WHO  JUST WON'T LET YOU GET A WORD IN  EDGEWISE? WELL, THE U.S. SENATE HAS A  FRIEND LIKE THAT. HIS NAME IS FILIBUSTER.
Jon: YOU KNOW THAT ONE FRIEND  WHO COMES TO WHERE YOU LIVE AND  REARRANGES YOUR STUFF? GERRYMANDER. ALL RIGHT. SO THE PROBLEM IS THE FILIBUSTER  WHERE AS FEW AS 41 SENATORS CAN  STOP ANY BILL DEAD IN ITS TRACK.
ACCEPT AT MAJORITY LEADER  HARRY REID IS PROPOSING CHANGES  TO THE FILIBUSTER THAT MIGHT MAKE THE SENATE LESS  DYSFUNCTIONAL
Jon: THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY  EASY. YOU COULD THE THAT WITH ALMOST  ANYTHING. MAKE IT SO THAT ONLY HUNGRY  KINDERGARTENERS AND OVULATING  CATS COULD BE SENATORS. THAT WOULD MAKE IT LESS  DYSFUNCTIONAL. I'M SORRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  THE FILIBUSTER
ONE OF REED'S IDEAS IS TO  REINSTATE THE TALKING FILIBUSTER  THE OLD PRINCIPLE IF YOU WANT TO FILIBUSTER YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO  STAND ON THE FLOOR FOR HOURS TO  MAKE YOUR CASE.
Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO  THAT NOW? YOU GET TO FILIBUSTER NOW  WITHOUT FILIBUSTERING? THAT'S LIKE SAYING WE'RE GOING  TO GO ON A HUNGER STRIKE WITH A  MOUTHFUL OF CHEESE BURGERS. THEY USED TO READ SONG LYRICS  FOR 13 HOURS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE  BUSINESS FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY  YOU BETTER BE WILLING TO MAKE AN [BLEEP] OUT OF YOURSELF DOING  IT. HARRY REID IS TRYING TO FIX THIS  MESS
WHAT THESE DEMOCRATS HAVE IN  MIND IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE TO  THE WAY THE SENATE OPERATES FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSOLIDATING  THEIR OWN POWER. I IMPLORE MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES  TO OPPOSE THIS NAKED POWER GRAB
Jon: WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT  WAY. NOBODY WANTS TO SEE HARRY REID'S  NAKED POWER GRAB. THAT'S FOR SURE. CHANGE IT. CHANGE IT! WHAT? OH, HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO MITCH  McCONNELL TO BLOCK THIS RULE  CHANGE? IT EMANATES FROM THE VERY CORE  OF HIS PRINCIPLES
UNTIL NOW YOU COULD SAY THAT  PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF A  POLITICAL MINORITY HAVE BEEN THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE  SENATE. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS MANY  OF US ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE  HAVE RAISED LOUD OBJECTIONS TO THE DIMINISHED RIGHTS OF THE  MINORITY.
Jon: YES, YES, YOU MIGHT HAVE  HEARD THAT WRONG. HE WAS SAYING THE DIMINISHED  RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY. HE'S FIGHTING FOR THE MINORITY. AS IN SENATE REPUBLICANS. NOT ACTUAL MINORITIES BECAUSE [BLEEP] THOSE PEOPLE. NOW OF COURSE WE COULD SHOW YOU  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TAKING  OPPOSITE POSITIONS ON FILIBUSTER REFORM WHEN THEIR ROLES WERE  REVERSED SEVEN YEARS AGO. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I  ACTUALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND. IF THE REPUBLICANS CAN  FILIBUSTER ANYTHING THE  DEMOCRATS PROPOSE, THEN HOW CAN  THE DEMOCRATS REFORM THE FILIBUSTER WITHOUT BEING  FILIBUSTERED?
DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID THEY  WON'T MOVE FORWARD ON ANY  CHANGES BEFORE JANUARY. WHEN THE 113th CONGRESS  BEGINS. AT THAT POINT, UNDER CONDITIONS  THAT ONLY APPLY ON THE FIRST DAY  OF A NEW SESSION, THEY COULD ALTER THE SENATE RULES BY A  SIMPLE MAJORITY.
Jon: JUST MAKE [BLEEP] UP. WHAT KIND OF RULE IS THAT? WE CAN'T DO IT EXCEPT ON THE  FIRST DAY OF A NEW SESSION WHEN  JUPITER ALIGN WITH MARS AND THE GIRL SENATORS GET TO ASK THE BOY  SENATORS TO THE DANCE. CRAZY RULES LIKE THESE GET IN  THE WAY, HOW DO YOU EXPECT  ANYTHING TO GET DONE?
THE SENATE WAS NOT  ESTABLISHED TO BE EFFICIENT
Jon: MISSION [BLEEP] ACCOMPLISHED. WE'LL BE RIGHT
