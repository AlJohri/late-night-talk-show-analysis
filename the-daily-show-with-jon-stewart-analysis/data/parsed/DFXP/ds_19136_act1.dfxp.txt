FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER RUSSIA TODAY REPORTER SARA FIRTH. BUT FIRST... [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] JUST CHECKING, I WAS JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF I HAVE RASFERMAGEN SYNDROME. A PROFESSOR OF ANATOMY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO IS JUST POINTING AT PEOPLE AND TELLING THEM, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM. BUT GETTING TO THE REGULAR SHOW, THE MIDDLE EAST, THIS IS TERRIBLY UPSETTING. IT REMAINS IN TURMOIL. THIS IS A DANGEROUS REGION, EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE THERE AND, SAY, MERELY EXPRESS THE MILDEST OF CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN TRAGEDY OF CIVILIANS WHO HAVE NOTHING DO WITH THE WARRING FACTIONS, ONLY TO TAKE A RASH OF [BLEEPED] FROM EVERYONE WHO WENT TO YOUR BAR MITZVAH. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. LOOK, A $50 SAVINGS BOND DOES NOT BUY YOU A LIFETIME OF CRITICISM. [LAUGHTER] BUT HELP IS ON THE WAY TO THIS TROUBLED REGION.
THE WORLD'S A SCARY DANGEROUS PLACE, BUT IT'S A LESS SCARY, LESS DANGEROUS PLACE WHEN AMERICA LEADS.
THE UNITED STATES HAS TRIED TO FOSTER PEACE, DEMOCRACY AND STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
BRING PEACE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
DOUBLE DOWN ON OUR EFFORTS TO BRING PEACE TO THIS REGION.
WE ALL WANT TO SEE PEACE.
Jon: IT'S WHAT WE DO. [LAUGHTER] NOW, ORIGINALLY WE JUST WENT TO THE REGION TO RID IT OF A MAD MAN WITH WMDs, BUT IT TURNED OUT HE DIDN'T HAVE THOSE, BUT AT THAT POINT WE REALIZED, ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST BRINGING THE REGION DEMOCRACY ANYWAY. BUT THEN THE REGION USED THEIR DEMOCRACY WRONG, TOTALLY USED IT WRONG, AND VOTED FOR NON-USDA APPROVED CANDIDATES. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, MIDDLE EAST, WHEN YOU'RE VOTING FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, YOU GOT TO READ THE LABELS. SO CLEARLY THE REGION IS STUBBORNLY RESISTING THE UNITED STATES' CHOICES FOR THEIR DEMOCRACIES. LOOKS LIKE THE U.S. IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO BRING ABOUT PEACE.
THE UNITED STATES GIVES ABOUT $1.3 BILLION A YEAR IN MILITARY AID TO EGYPT.
EGYPT USES F-16 JET FIGHTERS. THEY PROVIDE THE ABRAMS TANK. THEY PROVIDE THE APACHE HELICOPTER.
Jon: BUT, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE WANT A LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION, WE DIDN'T STOP THERE. JORDAN, WHY DON'T YOU TRY SOME JAVELIN MISSILES THERE. AND, HEY, HEY, SAUDI ARABIA, TURN THAT FROWN UPSIDE DOWN. HOW'S $6.8 BILLION WORTH OF PEACE, INCLUDING BUNKER-BUSTING BOMB, SLAMMER MISSILES, HAVE A HELICOPTER, AND DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA FORGET ABOUT YOU, IRAQ. YOU'RE THE O.G., THE ORIGINAL GEOPOLITICAL CATASTROPHE [BLEEPED].
THE PENTAGON, OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE IRAQ WITH BILLIONS IN MILITARY AID, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF APACHE HELICOPTERS FROM BOEING, HELL FIRE MISSILES ALSO MADE BY LOCKHEED.
Jon: WE'RE THE UNITED STATES. WE'RE LIKE THE OPRAH OF MIDDLE EAST WEAPONS SYSTEMS. YOU GET SOME BOMBS. YOU GET SOME BOMBS. EVERYBODY GETS SOME BOMBS. YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH, AS I LOOK AT THE MAP... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU'RE WELCOME. AS I LOOK AT THE MAP, I REALIZE THERE'S A LOT OF THE REGION THAT WE HAVEN'T PEACED TO THE HILT YET, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME THROW $4 BILLION OF MISSILES AND MUNITIONS TO THE U.A.E., AND OMAN, OH MAN, YOU GOT $2.1 BILLION RAYTHEON MISSILE SYSTEM COMING. KUWAIT NO LONGER. YOU SEEM LIKE A $4.2 BILLION IN PATRIOT MISSILES TYPE OF COUNTRY, AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT, BUT I GUESS IT'S TIME TO MAKE IT BAHRAIN. MISSILES. AND BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS. [LAUGHTER] GO SHOOT DOWN SOMETHING NICE. NO, NO, NO, GO SHOOT DOWN SOMETHING NICE, BUT DO NOT USE THOSE HELICOPTERS, BAHRAIN, TO CRACK DOWN ON POLITICAL DISSIDENTS IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY. DON'T USE THEM FOR THAT. AGAIN, DON'T DO IT AGAIN. AND DON'T THINK I'M FORGETTING ABOUT YOU, QATAR. I DON'T NORMALLY, I DON'T NORMALLY TRUST A COUNTRY THAT STARTS WITH A "Q" AND DOESN'T FOLLOW IT UP WITH A "U," BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HERE'S A LITTLE TASTE.
QATAR REPORTEDLY JUST SPENT $11 BILLION TO BUY AMERICAN PATRIOT MISSILE BATTERIES AND APACHE ATTACK HELICOPTERS.
Jon: DID I SAY TASTE? I MEANT A MOUTHFUL. NOW YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF, GEEZ, ALL THIS BUILDUP OF PEACE ON EARTH MIGHT SET OFF ALARMS ON VENUS. IT'S OKAY. WE'LL SEND THEM MISSILE, TOO. [BLEEPED] IT. I DON'T CARE. JUST NOT TO MARS, BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, THEY DON'T NEED MISSILES. THEY NEED MOMS. [APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY. IT JUST REALLY UPSETS ME. I JUST FEEL SO BADLY FOR MARS. SO NOW THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE THEMSELVES THE JOHNNY MISSILE SEEDS OF THE REGION, WE CAN FOCUS IN ON THE MAIN CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL HAS BEEN VERY STRONG, $3 BILLION A YEAR.
Jon: NOT MENTION ALL THE TREES WE'VE PLANTED THERE OVER THE YEARS. THAT'S GOT TO PROVIDE SOME COVER. AND EVEN WHEN WE'RE NOT SELLING ISRAEL WEAPONS, WE'RE HELPING THEM WITH A LITTLE R&D.
WHILE THE IRON DOME IS LARGELY ISRAELI TECHNOLOGY, MUCH OF THE FUNDING COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES. ISRAEL ASKED FOR $225 MILLION IN EMERGENCY FUNDING.
Jon: THE IRON DOME IS WHAT'S PROTECTED THEM FROM THOSE ROCKETS AND IS SO POPULAR WITH OUR LEGISLATORS. WE CAN JAM ITS FUNDING INTO ALMOST ANYTHING.
SENATE DEMOCRATS TIED THE FUNDING TO A PROBLEM MORE THAN 7,000 MILES AWAY. THE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL SENATE BORDER BILL.
Jon: EVERYONE KNOWS YOU MASH UP THE THING PEOPLE WANT WITH THE THING PEOPLE DON'T LIKE. BUT REALLY NEED. IT'S LIKE WHEN BO WON'T TAKE HIS ANTIBIOTICS AND THE PRESIDENT WRAPS IT IN A LITTLE SLICE OF AMERICAN CHEESE AND FEEDS IT TO HIM. LOOKS LIKE THERE AIN'T NOTHING THAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG WITH OUR PLAN TO SEND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WEAPONS TO AN INCREDIBLY VOLATILE REGION OF THE WORLD IN ORDER TO BRING IT PEACE.
ISIS MILITANTS WHO HAVE PICKED UP AMERICAN-MADE WEAPONS ON THEIR WAY FROM SYRIA.
NEARLY HALF A MILLION WEAPONS SUPPLIED BY THE U.S. TO AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES MAY END UP IN THE HANDS OF TALIBAN INSURGENTS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING WE FLOODED OUR ALLIES WITH SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEM TO FEND OFF ALL OUR OTHER SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS. BUT MY POINT IS BY FLOODING THE AREA WITH WEAPONRY, WE CAN KEEP THINGS PEACEFUL AND HAMAS ISOLATED.
THE BULK OF THE FINANCING THAT GOES TO HAMAS COMES FROM QATAR.
THEY GIVE $400 MILLION TO HAMAS.
Jon: WHAT? WHAT? WHAT THE [BLEEPED]? QATAR? WE JUST SOLD YOU $11 BILLION IN ARMS. YOU BETTER NOT BE REGIFTING. ARE YOU REGIFTING? [LAUGHTER] IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING? MAN! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW SOMETHING, SPREADING DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS SO HARD, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT SECOND AMENDMENT FIRST. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
