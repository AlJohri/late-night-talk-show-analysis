[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW IN 2022, THE FIFA WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT WILL BE HELD IN QATAR. GO FIGHTING MONARCH. IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THAT LOCATION WAS ANNOUNCED THE SELECTION HAS BEEN HIT WITH CRITICISM AFTER CRITICISM.
CONCERNS ABOUT HARSH WORKING CONDITIONS SURROUNDING PREPARATIONS FOR THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR.
ALLEGATIONS OF SLAVERY AND CORRUPTION.
QUESTIONS WERE ASKED ABOUT HOW A COUNTRY WHERE TEMPERATURES CAN EXCEED 40 GROWS CELSIUS CAN HANDLE A FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IN THE SUMMER.
Jon: OH, MY GOD HOW COULD YOU HAVE A FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT'S 40 DEGREES CELSIUS. THAT'S NEARLY -- [LAUGHTER] 9,000 DEGREES. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS WEEK THE COUNTRY OF QATAR TRIES TO PUT THAT CRITICISM BEHIND THEM AND UNVEIL THE PLANNED WORLD CUP STADIUMS. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT CAN WE COME BACK. I'M NOT -- I'M NOT USUALLY ONE TO SHOUT OUT OH, MY GOD THAT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT STEEL  VAGINA BUT THAT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT STEEL VAGINA OR EITHER THAT OR SOMETHING DONALD TRUMP PUTS HIS HAIR ON AT NIGHT A PUSENSUOUS BOWL CARVED FROM A PERFECT PEARL IN WHICH THE WORLD'S FINEST RESTAURANT PRESENTS A PLATE WITH A HUCKELBERRY GASTRIQUE AND THEN SERVED TO SOMEONE WHO IS PRETTY SURE THEY'RE EATING A TINY DONUT OUT OF A GIANT VAGINA. THERE'S MORE FOOTAGE OF STADIUM WHICH SENSUOUSLY GLIDES UP THE STADIUM'S OPENING AND DIVES IN FROM A VIEW WITHIN. I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THOSE THINGS. IF I MAY, WELL ATTENDED SOCCER MATCH WAS LOW ON THE LIST. I DIDN'T REALIZE. TO BE FAIR THE DESIGN IS NOT SHOCKING. IT'S A VARIATION ON THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE THE 70s. [ LAUGHTER ] OF COURSE THAT WAS -- [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS BEFORE THAT BEFORE BUILDING SUCCUMBED TO THE SHAME THAT IS A -- NOBODY SHOULD BE ALL THAT SURPRISED BY THIS STADIUM GIVEN IT DESIGNED BY A FAMED ARCHITECT WHOSE SIGNATURE STYLE APPEARS TO BE MAKING SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST INCREDIBLY (bleep) BUILDINGS. IT'S LIKE THE GEORGIA O'KEEFE OF THINGS YOU CAN WALK INSIDE. WHY DO SO MANY OF THE BUILDINGS LOOK SO FEMININE. IT'S NOT OTHER BUILDINGS ARE REMINISCENT OF -- OKAY ALL RIGHT. THAT. I GUESS IT'S TIME THINGS EVENED OUT A LITTLE BIT. FOR MORE WE TURN TO AL MADRIGAL IN QATAR. YOU WERE JUST INSIDE THIS STADIUM. YOU WENT DOWN TO THE PRESS BOX. WHAT DID YOU FIND? HOW WAS IT?
ACTUALLY JON, IF I'M GOING HONEST I COULDN'T FIND THE PRESS BOX.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU  MEAN YOU COULDN'T FIND THE PRESS BOX.
JON, I'VE BEEN IN PLENTY OF STADIUMS, ALL RIGHT. QUITE FRANKLY I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT. I'M STARTING TO THINK IT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST.
Jon: THE PRESS BOX IS THERE. BELIEVE ME. MY GUESS IS YOU DIDN'T REALLY TRY TO FIND IT.
HOW DARE YOU. I TRIED TO FIND IT. LOOK AT THE MAP. THEY SAID THAT -- THEY -- [LAUGHTER] -- THEY SAID THE PRESS BOX WAS HERE, MAN. I WAS THERE, JON. I WENT BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH FOR AN HOUR. AFTER A WHILE MY NECK STARTED TO HURT SO I LEFT.
Jon: HOW DID YOU HURT YOUR NECK LOOKING FOR PRESS BOX?
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT THING.
Jon: SO YOU ARE NOT GOING BACK IN?
I'M GOING TRY AGAIN. I MEAN, STILL A STADIUM, YOU KNOW. MAYBE THIS TIME I'LL LOOK AROUND THE BACK, I GUESS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THANK YOU AL.
