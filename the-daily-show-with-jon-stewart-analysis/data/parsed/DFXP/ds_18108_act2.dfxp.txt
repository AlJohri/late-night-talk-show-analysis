Jon: WELCOME BACK! NOW LISTEN, THE I.R.S. HAS BEEN  ACCUSED OF TARGETING RIGHT WING  GROUPS FOR SCRUTINY, WHICH IS VERY UNFAIR. IN FACT, IT'S THE ONLY UNFAIR  THING-- EVER. (LAUGHTER)  JASON JONES HAS MORE. I I LAST WEEK WE LEARNED THE  I.R.S. TARGETED TEA PARTY  MEMBERS AND CONSERVATIVES LIKE WAYNE ALLEN ROOT WERE FURIOUS.
I THINK THE I.R.S. SCANDAL IS  ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN  MODERN AMERICAN POLITICAL  HISTORY. MAYBE IN ALL OF POLITICAL  HISTORY. IF YOU SPEAK OUT AGAINST OBAMA  YOU ARE ORDERED TO BE  PERSECUTED.
SEE, NORMALLY, I WOULD LOVE  TO SAY YEAH, YOU'RE SUCH A  STUPID IDIOT! BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE THEY  TARGETED CONSERVATIVE GROUPS.
THEY DID.
SADLY, WAYNE ALLEN ROOT,  AUTHOR OF "THE ULTIMATE OBAMA  SURVIVAL GUIDE" KNOW THIS IS KIND OF PERSECUTION FIRSTHAND.
I WAS AUDITED, IT WAS THE  MOST TARGETED AUDIT YOU'VE EVER  SEEN. I THINK SOMEONE JUST PICKED UP  THE PHONE AND SAYS "DO ME A  FAVOR, THIS GUY IS BOTHERING US" AND SOME FROM THE WHITE HOUSE  PICKS UP A PHONE AND SAYS "RUIN  HIS LIFE."
AND FACTS ARE FACTS. EVEN THOUGH HE HAS NO  INFORMATION TO BACK THIS UP.
I WAS TARGETED FOR WHAT I  BELIEVE IN.
PROFILING IS WRONG.
RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO  PROPONENTS OF PROFILING WHO SAY  THINGS LIKE "THE SIMPLE SOLUTION IS TO END POLITICAL CORRECTNESS  BY ADOPTING THE ISRAELI MODEL OF  PROFILING?"  WHO SAID THAT? THAT WAS -- THAT WAS -- I'VE GOT  IT SOMEWHERE HERE. OH, THAT WAS SAID BY WAYNE ALLEN  ROOT.
WAYNE ALLEN ROOT SAID THAT?
YEAH.
Jon: .
REALLY? WHEN DID WAYNE ALLEN ROOT SAY  THAT.
OKAY, SO LET'S ANSWER THAT. HERE WE GO, THREE, TWO, ONE. PROFILING IS USEFUL IN POLICE  INSTANCES WHEN YOU'RE TALKING  ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING ON AN  AIRPLANE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ISSUE THAN  PROFILING SOMEONE FOR THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.
THOUGH IT APPEARS TO BE OKAY  TO TARGET SOMEONE FOR THEIR  RELIGIOUS BELIEFS -- ANYBODY NAMED ON DUAL OR MOHAMMED OR  ACHMED, LET'S PUT THEM IN A ROOM  AND MAKE SURE THEY DON'T HAVE  EXPLOSIVES.
OR SKIN COLOR.
WHY IS STOP-AND-FRISK  DIRECTED AT LATINO AND BLACK  KIDS? BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES DOING  THE SHOOTINGS.
IT'S JUST NOT OKAY TO TARGET  SOMEONE FOR THEIR PRESIDENT CAL  BELIEFS.
I JUST -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW  WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. IT'S SO ABSURB SURD. I -- THREE, TWO, ONE. YOU TALK ABOUT A COMPLETELY 100%  DIFFERENT SITUATION. (LAUGHTER)
SO WE SHOULDN'T PROFILE EVER  UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY?
CORRECT. LAST I CHECKED, THE PROFILING  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAS NEVER  RUINED A HUMAN BEING'S LIFE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.
HE WAS RIGHT-- OTHER THAN THE  FEW HUNDRED INSTANCES OF  PROFILING RUINING PEOPLE'S LIVES AND IN SOME CASES ENDING THEM. NOW WE JUST NEED TO GET THESE  PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR  INSTANCES OF PROFILING ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
THIS IS DAMONT, A YOUNG  AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. THIS IS LINDA, A MUSLIM  AMERICAN, AND THIS IS FRANK  LOPEZ WHO IS MEXICAN.
DOMINICAN.
WHATEVER, IT'S ALL BASICALLY  THE SAME. (LAUGHTER)  YOU'VE EACH BEEN PROFILED.
YES.
TELL ME ABOUT THE WORST TIME  THAT YOU'VE BEEN PROFILED.
I WAS WALKING TO GO PLAN OUT  SOME WORKSHOPS THAT I DO IN THE  COMMUNITY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN TWO DETECTIVES HOP UP OUT OF AN  UNMARKED CAR, GET US UP AGAINST  THE WALL AND HE STARTS GOING INTO MY BAG AND IN MY POCKET AND  INTO THE LINING OF MY UNDERWEAR. HE SAYS "I DON'T GIVE A (BLEEP)  IF YOU CONSENT OR NOT, THIS IS  THE BRONX."
I CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT AN INCONVENIENCE  AND AN UNFORTUNATE ONE BUT AT INCONVENIENCE NOT A DISASTER. TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.
HOW IS IT NOT A DISASTER? I'VE BEEN STOPPED AND I'VE BEEN  SENT TO CENTRAL BOOKINGS, I'VE  BEEN SENT TO --
FOR WHAT? FOR WHAT?
FOR DOING NOTHING WHATSOEVER. THAT'S DESTROYING MY LIFE.
WHEN THE DAY COMES WHERE YOU  HAVE BUILT AND BUSINESS AND IT'S  WORTH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THE I.R.S. COMES AND TRIES TO  DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU BUILT AND  TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU YOU'LL THINK BACK AT THE FEW TIMES YOU  WERE AT AN AIRPORT WHERE SOMEONE  ASKED YOU QUESTIONS OR PULLED YOU ASIDE AND YOU SAY WOW,  THAT'S A NEW LEVEL OF  INCONVENIENCE. THE OTHER WAS INCONVENIENT, THIS  IS THE DESTRUCTION OF MY  BUSINESS AND MY LIFE.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL WHEN IT  HAPPENS ONCE BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS  EVERY SINGLE TIME, THAT'S A  PROBLEM. THAT'S CRAZY AND CALLOUS.
CALLOUS. FUNNY WORD, CALLOUS. THEY'RE NOT LAUGHING. (LAUGHTER)  SADLY, THESE PEOPLE WILL JUST  NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT'S LIKE  TO BE PROFILED BY THE GOVERNMENT JUST BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE AND  WHAT YOU REPRESENT.
WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT NO ONE'S  COMPLAINING ABOUT BEING PROFILED  THEY'RE NOT LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE BEING PROFILED ON A DAILY  BASIS.
IF SOMEHOW THOSE PEOPLE WERE  IN THE SAME POSITION, THEY'D BE  OUTRAGED WITHOUT SEEING THE INHERENT IRONY. (LAUGHTER)  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THREE, TWO, ONE, BUSTED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: JASON JONES, WE'LL BE  RIGHT BACK
