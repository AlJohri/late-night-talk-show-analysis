WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, AND I'M SURE THAT YOU ARE --  [LAUGHTER] -- EVERY YEAR YOU MAKE A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION TO MAKE YOU YOUR CHILDREN LOSE WEIGHT. [LAUGHTER] AND IF yOt LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO STICKING TO THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT TO GET A LOT EASIER. AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
CHILDHOOD OBESITY. IT'S A DEVASTATING PROBLEM EFFECTING THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US, HEADLESS CHILDREN. FORTUNATELY THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS FOUND A WAY TO SOLVE THE VEXING OBESITY CRISIS.
SAN FRANCISCO IS BASICALLY BANNING HAPPY MEALS THENCH VOTED TO BAN TOYS FROM HAPPY MEALS  THAT DON'T MEET NUTRITIONAL STANDARDS.
THAT'S RIGHT. UNDER THE GNAW WILL YOU ALL FAST FOOD MEALS NEED TO HAVE LESS THAN 600 CALORIES AND CONTAIN  FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO GET A TOY. THE COUNCILMAN PUSHED THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION SHOWING THE TOY IS THE HEALTHIEST THING IN THE MEAL.
McDONALDS AND BURGER KING USED TOYS TO LURE KIDS, TOYS ATTACHED TO MEALS FOR FOODS THAT  IS VERY BAD FOR THEM.
WE KNOW THAT. WHAT YOU ARE BASICALLY TELLING US IS:  GUESS WHAT? McDONALDS FOOD IS (bleep).
YES.
DUH.
IF THERE'S NO TOY THE KIDS WOULDN'T EAT THE MEALS. NO, OF COURSE THEY WOULDN'T. AS OUR HIDDEN CAMERA SHOT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SIX-YEAR-OLD SHOWS THERE'S  NOTHING APPEALING AT McDONALDS EXCEPT THE MILKSHAKE, THE FRIES AND THE McNUGGETï¿½MS. YOU SAID TO GET YOUR TOY YOU HAVE TO EAT YOUR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES. WE WANT HEALTHIER OPTIONS IF THEY WANT TO ATTACH A TOY TO IT.
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID. YOU JUST SAID THE SAME THING I JUST SAID. OF COURSE, IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU GET YOUR COUNTER CULTURE RADICAL COMPLAINING LIKE MYER GAVIN NEWSOME.
IT'S A BAD IDEA. WE'RE GETTING INTO PRIVATE BUSINESS DECISIONS. IT'S NOT THE ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF KIDS. IT'S THE ROLE OF PARENTS TO DECIDE.
YOU ARE REALLY GOOD LOOKING. [LAUGHTER]
WHAT THE MAYOR SEEMS TO HAVE LOST SIGHT OF IS IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE CHILDREN.
I THINK IT IS THE WORST THING THAT THEY HAVE EVER DONE AND  THEY DON'T START GIVING OUT THE TOYS, GOODBYE. YOU GUYS JUST DON'T GET IT. THESE TOYS ARE MAKING YOU FAT. HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?
52 POUNDS.
YOU COULD BE 50. [LAUGHTER] WITH SO MUCH AT RISK, THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS TO STEP IN OR IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR  CHILDREN TO KNOW WHAT IS BAD FOR THEM.
MY TEN-YEAR-OLD HAS HAD A NUMBER OF HAPPY MEALS GROWING UP  BUT SHE'S WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE FOOD IS UNHEALTHY FOR HER.
HOW DOES SHE FIGURE THAT OUT?
I THINK SHE WATCHES SUPERSIZED WITH ME.
SO SHE LEARNED FROM HER PARENTS.
THAT'S A LARGE PART OF IT.
WOULD IT BE HARD TO PASS A LAW TO FORCE NETFELIX -- NETFLIX TO SEND SUPERSIZE ME TO EVERY HOME.
YOU CAN'T FORCE A PRIVATE COMPANY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW STPH-FPLG WE HAVE NO POWER TO FORCE A PRIVATE COMPANY LIKE  THAT TO CHANGE A BUSINESS PRACTICE. [LAUGHTER]
SO ON ONE HAND YOU ARE LIKE WE CAN'T DO THAT BUT ON THE  OTHER HAND, YOU ARE DOING THAT.
WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF POWER.
YOU JUST SAID YOU DID.
WE'RE LOOKING AT FOOD FROM A FOOD ENVIRONMENT ISSUES FROM AN EQUITYABILITY --  [LAUGHTER]
THE LAW TAKES EFFECT LATER THIS YEAR. WITH NO MORE HAPPY MEALS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE CAN ONLY HOPE THEY'LL LOVE THE BRAND NEW  CRAPPY MEAL. IT HAS A PERIODIcï¿½ TABLE OF ELEMENTS, DVR INSTRUCTIONS AND AN ACTION FIGURE. IT'S SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES KATHLEEN IS A BEALOUS. LOOK --
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MORE CHILDREN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT AND  OBESE THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE IN THIS NATION.
IN ALL THIS THERE'S ONE THING HURTING CHILDREN THE MOST.
TAKE THIS OFF YOUR FACE NOW. IT WON'T HURT. REALLY FAST. ONE, TWO THREE --
