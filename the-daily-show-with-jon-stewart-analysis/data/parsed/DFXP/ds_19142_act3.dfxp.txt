Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A FILMMAKER. HER DOCUMENTARY IS CALLED "RICH HILL."
DEAR MOM. I'VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL A MONTH. I BROKE MY NECK. JUST KIDDING. THE PRINCIPAL SAID THAT I AIN'T GETTING ANY CREDITS FOR THIS SEMESTER, SO THEY UNENROLLED ME. NO I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND YET. BIG CAPITAL LETTERS. LOVE YOU, FROM HARLEY.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME TRACY DROZ TRAGOS. HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO SEE YOU. COME.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: PLEASE, THIS FILM "RICH HILL" IS BEAUTIFUL AND HEARTBREAKING AND HARD TO WATCH, BUT IMPORTANT TO WATCH. WHAT... TELL US THE PROJECT.
WELL, IT'S A FILM ABOUT THREE KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN SOUTHWEST RURAL MISSOURI, A TOWN NAMED RICH HILL, WHICH IS MY FAMILY HOMETOWN.
Jon: OH, YOU'RE FROM THERE?
IT'S WHERE MY FATHER GREW UP AND IT'S WHERE I SPENT EVERY SUMMER AND WINTER BREAK AS A KID. MY FATHER WAS KILLED IN VIETNAM WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG, AND MY GRANDPARENTS, WHO LIVED THERE, WERE LIKE SURROGATE PARENTS TO ME.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO WE WANTED TO GO BACK. I DIRECTED THIS WITH MY COUSIN.
Jon: RIGHT.
WHO IS A CINEMATOGRAPHER. AND WE WANTED TO GO BACK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR THE FAMILIES THAT WERE STRUGGLING THERE IN THE HOUSES WITH THE TARPS FOR ROOFS AND, YOU KNOW, THE BROKEN WINDOWS AND...
Jon: AND THIS IS A TOWN THAT'S BEEN STRUGGLING SINCE REALLY WORLD WAR II, SINCE THE COLD WAR.
YEAH IT WAS RICH HILL FOR COAL.
Jon: YEAH.
AND THEN THE COAL WENT DRY. AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE INDUSTRY.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO...
Jon: TOUGH. BUT IT GIVES A LOOK INTO A POVERTY THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT AS MUCH.
YEAH, YEAH, OR DON'T THINK ABOUT IN A CERTAIN KIND OF WAY. I MEAN, WE REALLY WANTED TO TELL AN INTIMATE, EMOTIONAL, UP-CLOSE STORY. WE DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, WE WANTED TO TELL THE HUMAN STORY BEHIND THE STATISTICS, AND SOMETIMES THESE FAMILIES GET, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT SEE THEM IN LIKE "HONEY BOO BOO" OR "DUCK DYNASTY."
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT, IT'S KIND OF MORE OF A REALITY TV IN AND OUT.
Jon: YES. THIS IS NO CARICATURE OF ANYTHING.
NO. WE REALLY GAVE THESE KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES KIND OF AUTHORSHIP...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND KIND OF GOT OUT OF THE WAY AND LET THEM TELL THEIR STORY.
Jon: THEY'RE WILDLY OPEN, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS ESPECIALLY FOR THREE TEENAGE BOYS, ONES WHO ALSO HAVE... I MEAN, THERE ARE SOME VERY DIFFICULT THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.
YEAH.
Jon: AND THEY ARE WILDLY AVAILABLE FOR THAT.
YEAH, I MEAN, THE TRUST WAS KIND OF AMAZING. AND THEY TRUSTED US. I HOPE WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO VIOLATE THAT TRUST IN THE END, BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE MY GRANDPARENTS WERE WELL-KNOWN IN TOWN...
Jon: RIGHT.
MY GRANDMOTHER WAS A THIRD GRADE SCHOOL TEACH THAT EVERYBODY LOVED, SO THAT WAS KIND OF A GOOD CREDENTIAL FOR US.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I DON'T, I THINK ULTIMATELY THERE WAS A FEELING OF THEM WANTING TO TELL THEIR STORY AND WANTING TO BE HEARD...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEY WERE INTERESTED THAT ANYBODY CARED AT ALL, YOU KNOW, THAT ANYBODY WAS KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR.
Jon: RIGHT. YEAH, I THOUGHT, I MEAN, FOR YOU TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON THIS WAS REALLY VERY UPSETTING TO ME. I REALLY PREFER NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] SO, DAMN YOU DROZ TRAGOS. IT'S, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME, SO WE HAVE THIS IMAGE. YOU KNOW, THERE IS A CERTAIN POPULATION IN THIS COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES THAT POVERTY IS LACK OF VIRTUE.
YEAH.
Jon: AND HERE YOU HAVE JUST LAID OUT THE HUMANITY OF THESE KIDS GOING THROUGH THEIR STRUGGLES, THE DIFFICULTY THEY HAVE IN CLAIMING THEIR VIRTUE AND IN JUST TRYING TO GET BY, AND YOU CANNOT HELP BUT THINK WE ARE SADDLING A GENERATION WITH JUST BAGGAGE THAT IS, YOU KNOW, YOU'D HAVE TO BE SISYPHUS TO GET OUT OF THAT.
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE RESILIENCE OF THESE KIDS.
Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ANDREW, ONE OF THE BOYS, HE'S SO FRICKEN OPTIMISTIC.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND YET HE HAS SO MANY CHALLENGES. AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO REALIZE HIS DREAMS. I REALLY HOPE SO, I REALLY BELIEVE IN THIS KID.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, HIS HARD WORK IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. HE HAS SO MANY CHALLENGES IN HIS LIFE.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THAT'S THE THING I HOPE IN SOME WAYS THIS FILM WILL KIND OF SHIFT THE CONVERSATION AROUND, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, THAT IT'S JUST FOLKS ARE LAZY OR IT'S THEIR CHOICE...
Jon: RIGHT.
IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES...
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW...
Jon: I WOULD LIKE ANYBODY TO WALK A MILE IN THESE KIDS' SHOES...
YEAH.
Jon: AND SEE HOW WELL YOU CAN DO. AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING IS SO THE CONGRESSWOMAN IN THOSE KIDS' DISTRICT VOTED TO CUT SNAP FUNDING, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS STUNNING.
YEAH.
Jon: AND I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO SLEEP WITH THAT DECISION. IT'S, IT'S MIND BLOWING.
NO WHEN YOU'RE IN THESE HOMES AND YOU SEE HOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY, I MEAN, THEY'RE RATIONING FOOD AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT...
Jon: AND WATER AND HEATING IT UP TO BATHE, I MEAN IT'S...
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: IT'S INTENSE.
YEAH. YEAH. IT IS, IT IS INTENSE. AND IT'S ALSO NOT WITHOUT HOPE. I MEAN, I THINK SOME OF THESE THINGS...
Jon: RIGHT.
THE PROBLEM IS COMPLEX, BUT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO LIFT UP FAMILIES WHO HAVE HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD.
Jon: I THOUGHT THE HOPE IS IN THOSE KIDS' RESILIENCE. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SEE THE CHALLENGES AHEAD, BUT YOU ALSO SEE LIKE, SOMEBODY BUYS INTO THIS KID, SOMEBODY GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION, LIKE THAT'S GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE.
YEAH, YEAH, BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT ALL THE KIDS THAT DON'T HAVE FILMS MADE ABOUT THEM AND WE HOPE THAT THERE IS SOME AWARENESS...
Jon: WAIT IS THAT YOUR PROPOSAL NOW? WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND MAKE FILMS ABOUT EVERY ONE OF THESE KIDS?
YEAH.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT IS INTERESTING TOO IS THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO THERE'S URBAN POVERTY AND RURAL POVERTY AND SOMEHOW THEY ARE THIS DISTINCT FUNCTION. BUT THEY'RE NOT. BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF SERVICES FOR THE MORE RURAL KIDS STRUCK ME, THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO GAIN SERVICES.
YEAH, I MEAN, THERE'S A DISTINCT STING TO RURAL POVERTY, WHICH IS YOUR ISOLATION.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND YOU KNOW, YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR GAS, YOU'RE REALLY STUCK.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND YOU KNOW, IN RICH HILL THEY'RE JUST NOW GETTING, YOU KNOW, 911. I MEAN, THERE'S NOT EVEN THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES. IT WOULD BE A VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD RESPOND TO CALLING THEM DIRECTLY.
Jon: RIGHT. IT'S AMAZING. IT'S AN AMAZING PROJECT. AND I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO BRING IT TO EVERYBODY. AND I RECOMMEND IT. "RICH HILL" IT'S AVAILABLE ON ITUNES, AMAZON, VIDEO ON DEMAND. IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE IN THEATERS, YES?
IT'S IN THEATERS RIGHT NOW.
Jon: IT'S IN THEATERS RIGHT NOW AND IT'S GOING TO OPEN IN MORE CITIES THROUGHOUT AUGUST IF PEOPLE GO SEE IT. SO, I RECOMMEND YOU DO IT. TRACY DROZ TRAGOS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
