OCTOBER 2, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, SANDRA  BULLOCK. STAR OF THE NEW MOVIE "GRAVITY." AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE. [APPLAUSE] SHE HAS TO KEEP HER SPACESHIP  GOING AT 55 MILES AN HOUR. [LAUGHTER] OR THE MOON BLOWS UP. [LAUGHTER] LET'S BEGIN WITH THE ONLY STORY  ANYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN OR AS  WE'RE CALLING IT --  [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] OH, WHY DIDN'T I TUCK!  OH!  [LAUGHTER] LOOK, I MAY HAVE OVER THE PAST  FEW DAYS LEADING UP TO AND  THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN  THROWN AROUND SOME RATHER  DERISIVE TERMS TO TALK ABOUT  THOSE IN CONGRESS THAT HAVE NOT  FUNDED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF A PAST LAW THEY DON'T LIKE  GOING INTO EFFECT. I MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED THE WORD   IDIOT, DUNDERHEADS,  MORONS. LET ME CHECK SOME OF THE NAMES. MAY HAVE REFERRED TO THEM AS  FART-KNOCKERS. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA  FART-KNOCKERS. BABIES THAT EAT THEIR OWN POOP. BABIES THAT EAT THEIR OWN POOP AND THEN POOP OUT THAT POOP AND THEN HOLD THAT POOP IN THE AIR AND YELL, YOU AGAIN!  AND EAT THAT POOP. I MAY HAVE CALLED THEM ON THIS  VERY VERY PROGRAM, TAINT SNIFF  McGILLICUDIES. MY POINT IS, I WOULD LIKE TO  APOLOGIZE. I MAY HAVE BEEN WAY TOO EASY ON THEM. [APPLAUSE] TWO DAYS INTO THE SHUTDOWN THAT THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS, THEY THEMSELVES CAUSED. THEY HAD THE BALLS TO TAKE TO  THE PEOPLE'S CHAMBER AND  COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN'S  EFFECTS. AND LEST YOU THINK THEIR COMPLAINTS ECHOED CONCERNS ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN HURTING OUR NATION'S MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS, REST  ASSURED THESE BALD EAGLE FELLATORS HAD OTHERS.  [LAUGHTER] HAD OTHER THINGS ON THEIR MIND.
FAMILIES THAT LONG AGO MADE PLANS TO VISIT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY  OR  YOSEMITE FOUND THESE SITES  SHUTTERED TODAY. I WENT TO E-VERIFY, THIS IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM, E-VERIFY IS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, IT'S A COMPUTER, THE PANDA CAM AT THE ZOO WAS SHUT DOWN. THAT'S A CAMERA. IT'S NOT A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE.
I MEAN, THERE I AM IN MY  PANDA COSTUME. ALL SET TO MASTURBATE. I TURN ON THE PANDA CAM AND  NOTHING!  [LAUGHTER] THEN I FEEL LIKE A JACK ASS. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? MASTURBATE TO KOALAS? COME ON. CAN'T DO THAT. THEIR EYES ARE TOO SAD AND  JUDGMENTAL. DON'T JUDGE ME. YOU EAT EUCALYPTUS. [BLEEP] YOU. SORRY. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] I WASN'T INSINUATING A  CONGRESSMAN MASTURBATES TO  PICTURES OF PANDAS. MORE GALLING THAN THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS MISPLACED ILL PRIORITIZED OUTRAGE IS THEIR INSISTENCE THAT THE PARTY THAT HAS RUN FOR THE LAST  40 YEARS OR SO ON THE IDEA THAT  GOVERNMENT IS THE ENEMY IS  SADDENED TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT  CRIPPLED LIKE THIS.
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO SHUT  DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
IT'S CLEAR THAT PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND HARRY REID WOULD  RATHER SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN. >>FOR THEM TO SAY THAT THIS IS A REPUBLICAN SHUTDOWN IS UNBELIEVABLE.
WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT OPEN.
WE DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT  TO SHUT DOWN. THAT NARRATIVE IS FALSE.
IT'S ONLY THE DEMOCRATS THAT  TALK ABOUT WANTING TO SHUT DOWN  THE GOVERNMENT.
[BLEEP]!  I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. [APPLAUSE] I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. I MEANT TO SAY BULL [BLEEP]. [LAUGHTER] WHEN, WHEN DID THE BIG  GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATS BECOME THE  NO-GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATS? YOU --  [LAUGHTER] SELF-RIGHTEOUS ZEBRA QUEEFS. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF SCORE THAT WOULD GET ME IN SCRABBLE? ZEBRA QUEEFS. SIX WEEKS AGO, THERE WAS A  LETTER THAT FLOATED THE IDEA OF  USING TO PARAPHRASE JAMES  MADISON, THE POWER OF THE PURSE  AS A WEAPON TO REDRESS  GRIEVANCES. LAYING OUT A PLAN TO DEFUND THE  IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT  OF OBAMA CARE IN ANY CONTINUING  APPROPRIATIONS BILL. ESSENTIALLY SAYING, IF YOU EVER  WANT TO SEE YOUR BELOVED PANDA  CAM AGAIN, YOU WILL LOSE IT. THAT WAS SIGNED BY 80 HOUSE  REPUBLICANS. IT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS GIVE AWAY  OF WHAT THEY WERE PLANNING SINCE THE GUY ON PRISON BREAK SHOWED  UP IN JAIL WITH A MAP OF THE  JAIL TATTOOED ON HIM. WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING? [LAUGHTER] SO ENOUGH. [APPLAUSE] ENOUGH PRETENDING. STOP TRYING TO PHOTO-OP YOUR WAY OUT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS  [BLEEP].
ALL OF US HERE SITTING AT A  TABLE WAITING FOR THE SENATE  DEMOCRATS TO JOIN US SO WE CAN  BEGIN TO RESOLVE OUR  DIFFERENCES.
Jon: I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE  GUYS. THEY LOOK LIKE A FOCUS GROUP FOR A HIGH FIBER BREAKFAST CEREAL. [LAUGHTER] I'M KIDDING. ACTUALLY THAT GROUP LOOKS LIKE  THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL  COMMITTEE FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH  ISSUES. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY --  [APPLAUSE] WHAT WAS THIS MEETING THREE  YEARS AGO? WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH THE  PRESIDENT TO HASH OUT YOUR  DIFFERENCES. I CAN'T TELL IF YOU -- IN  FLEXIBLE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA  THAT NEVER EXISTED FETISHIZING  ZEBRA QUEEFS -- I'M GOING TO  REUSE ZEBRA QUEEFS -- I CAN'T  TELL IF THEY'RE DUMB OR THINK WE ARE. SO TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WE  HAVE JOHN OLIVER JOINING US. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
THESE GUYS WERE CLAMORING  MONTHS AND MONTHS WE'RE GOING TO DEFUND OBAMA CARE OR NOT FUND  THE BUDGET. NOW THEY'RE SAYING WHAT? WE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO  WITH THIS. THEY THINK WE'RE STUPID. ARE THEY STUPID? WHAT'S GOING ON?
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE. THEY THINK YOU'RE STUPID.
ALL RIGHT.
AND NOT YOU, EVERYBODY.
Jon: BUT THESE GUYS ARE  RISKING A TREMENDOUS BACKLASH.
LET ME CORRECT YOU THERE. ACTUALLY RISKING ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING. LOOK, CONGRESS ALREADY HAS A 90% INCUMBENCY RATE THAT GOES ALONG  WITH A 10% APPROVAL RATING. THE ONLY PREVIOUS INSTANCE OF  THAT LEVEL OF DISAPPROVAL  COMBINED WITH THAT LEVEL OF  MARKET RETENTION IS TIME-WARNER  CABLE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WOW.
THAT'S THE ONLY ON-RECORD  INSTANCE.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING, IF I'M  HEARING YOU CORRECTLY, YOU'RE  SAYING CONGRESS IS THE  TIME-WARNER CABLE OF DEMOCRACY?
I KNOW THAT'S INCREDIBLY  HARSH.
Jon: YES.
BUT IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY  FAIR. BUT THROUGH THE TIME-HONORED  TRADITION OF ELECTORAL CORRUPTION AND GERRYMANDERING THESE GUYS ARE INVINCIBLE. LET ME PROVE IT TO YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?
Jon: WOW.
GO AHEAD.
Jon: I'M GOING TO SAY A WITCH BEING ELECTROCUTED INSIDE A  BAT'S VAGINA.
YOU'RE CLOSE. IT'S LOUISIANA'S SIXTH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. OBVIOUSLY IT MAKES NO PHYSICAL  SENSE. WHEN IT WAS REDRAWN IN 2010, THE WHITE MAJORITY INCREASED FROM 60 TO 74% TAKING IT FROM REPUBLICAN TO TURBO REPUBLICAN. AND IS REPRESENTED BY BILL  CASSIDY, ONE OF THE 80 REPS THAT SIGNED THAT LETTER AND WHO WON  IN 2012 WITH A SADDAM  HUSSEIN-LIKE NEARLY 70% MARGIN  OF VICTORY. HE'S JUST ONE OF CONGRESS' NEW  DANGEROUS BREED OF SUPER  INCUMBENTS.
Jon: EVEN IF HIS ACTIONS ARE  UNPOPULAR AT A NATIONAL LEVEL,  HE PAYS NO PRICE ELECTORALLY?
NO. HE'S AN ELECTORAL X MAN. HE CAN SHOOT DOWN THE  GOVERNMENT, REFUSE TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, POISON A BASKET OF  KITTENS IN FRONT OF ANOTHER  BASKET OF KITTENS SO LONG AS  OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT AND HE WOULD  BE FINE.
Jon: THIS IS -- I THINK --
WHAT?
Jon: OUR ONLY HOPE -- AND I  SAY THIS --
I WANT TO HEAR IT.
Jon: ENOUGH OF THE REMAINING  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN. SACK UP AND COMBINE WITH ENOUGH  DEMOCRATS TO GO AGAINST THESE  MUTANTS AND ELECTORALLY WIPE  THEM OUT FOR GOOD FOR THE GOOD  OF OUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. THAT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
UH-HUH. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY
