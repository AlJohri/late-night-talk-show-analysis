NOVEMBER 30, 2011, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. LATER -- WE'RE SO EXCITED TONIGHT. LATER ON THE PROGRAM WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO A YOUNG IRISH MUSICIAN NAMED BONO. WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- TO HAVE THIS GENTLEMAN ON THE SHOW. FINALLY --  [ LAUGHTER ] -- FINALLY WHAT PUT US OVER THE TOP, AND I SAY THIS TO ANY SHOW LOOKING TO BOOK HIM, BASKET OF HAGGAS. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WATCH OUR SHOW REGULARLY AND I'M SURE THERE'S ONE OF YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] , WE DEVOTED AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME ON THE PROGRAM TO THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO SOMETIMES CHOOSE NEW LEADERS? [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME BACK UP. DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER COUNTRIES? [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S TRUE. THERE'S AREAS ON THE MAP THAT WE SOMETIMES LEARN ABOUT WHAT WE ARE BOMBING THEM. ONE OF THOSE SUCH COUNTRIES, EGYPT, JUST HAD AN HISTORICAL ELECTION. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S INDECISION COVERAGE. ♪ ♪  [ LAUGHTER ] WOW. [ LAUGHTER ] A PHARAOH REFERENCE AND A MUMMY REFERENCE. THAT IS THE EXTENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF EGYPT SADLY. ANYWAY, SO JUST EIGHT SHORT MONTHS AFTER THE HISTORIC UPRISING THAT OUSTED HOSNI MIEW  BACKAR, THE DICTATOR, THE EGYPTIANS BEGAN FREE OPEN ELECTIONS ON MONDAY. BESIDES THE LOGISTICAL AND SAFETY CHALLENGES OF THE VOTE, THE EGYPTIAN ELECTION PRESENTED OTHER LESSER KNOWN ISSUES.
A LOT OF EGYPTIANS CAN'T READ OR WRITE. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO VOTE IN A SYMBOL INSTEAD.
IT'S LIKE A SOCCER BALL OR VIKING SHIP.
THESE PARTIES, YOU CAN VOTE FOR A TANK. UP HERE THERE'S A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES. THERE'S A PYRAMID, A ROCKET OVER HERE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I DON'T WANT TO LOOK DOWN MY NOSE AT THIS BUT IN WHAT UNIVERSE DOES TANK LOSE TO SUNGLASSES? [ LAUGHTER ] SERIOUSLY, IF I'M TANK I'M LIKE I WILL (bleep) CRUSH YOU. YOU'RE SUNGLASSES. WHO IS CHOOSING? LOOK, EGYPT, I KNOW YOU ARE KNEW TO THIS, YOU WANT A SOPHISTICATED DEMOCRACY YOU  CAN'T HAVE YOUR PARTIES REPRESENTED BY A MYRIAD OF SYMBOLS WITH EVERYTHING FROM  GUITARS TO ASSAULT WEAPONS NOBODY WILL TAKE YOUR DEMOCRACY SERIOUSLY UNTIL YOU HAVE JUST TWO. [ LAUGHTER ] [  APPLAUSE  ] NOW THAT MAKES SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] STILL IF NOTHING ELSE THE SYMBOL BASED ELECTION APPROACH HAS LED TO INNOVATIVE ATTACK ADS.
HE SAYS HE KNOWS WHAT IS BEST FOR EGYPT BUT ARE BLENDER'S PRIORITIES ARE MIXED UP? EVEN VIKING SHIP AGREES BLENDER WILL SINK OUR ECONOMY FASTER THAN A TOOTH BRUSH ADMINISTRATION. BUT SOCCER BALLS LEADERSHIP WILL GET THINGS ROLLING AGAIN RIGHT TOWARDS THE OBJECTIVE. I'M SOCCER BALL AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YEAH, YEAH. I'M NOT IMPRESSED BY ANY. I'M WAITING FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE TO GET INTO THE RACE. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [ LAUGHTER ] GOOD LOOKING SANDWICH. [ LAUGHTER ] DESPITE THE ITEM YULT IN EGYPT MONDAY'S ELECTION WAS PEACEFUL AND INSPIRING. STARTING TODAY EGYPT IS NOW A FUNCTIONING REPRESENTATIVE DEM CINCH THE PARLIAMENT ELECTED  THROUGH THIS PROCESS WILL BE ONE WITHOUT POWER. EVEN AFTER THE POLITICIANS TAKE THEIR SEATS THE COUNTRY WILL STILL BE RUN BY AN UNELECTED  MILITARY COUNCIL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OKAY THEN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE WINNER IS NOT SYMBOL TANK BUT TANK TANK. FOR MORE WE TERN TO THE MIDDLE EAST POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AASIF MANDVI. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT APPEARS THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS OVER HOW MEANINGFUL THE EGYPTIAN  ELECTIONS REALLY ARE.
SURE, JON, THERE ARE ISSUES TO BE SORTED OUT BUT THIS JUST THE BEGINNING. A DEMOCRACY IS A DELICATE FLOWER. WITH THIS ELECTION, EGYPT HAS PLANTED THE SEED AND IF ITS PEOPLE DEND TO IT WITH ENOUGH  DEVOTION AND PATIENCE THIS FORMER DESERT OF DICTATORSHIP WILL BLOSSOM TO A BEAUTIFUL  GARDEN OF FREEDOM.
Jon: OKAY. [ LAUGHTER ] UM --  [ LAUGHTER ] WELL --  [ LAUGHTER ] I HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
YOU DON'T SEEM ALL THAT EXCITED ABOUT IT.
Jon: NO, NO,, NO I'M EXCITED FOR THEM.
YOU DON'T SOUND EXCITED.
Jon: I'M EXCITED. I HOPE IT WORKS OUT I'M EXCITED.
I DON'T GET IT AMERICANS ARE ALL FOR SPREADING DEMOCRACY IN  THE MIDDLE EAST WHEN YOU ARE DOING THE SPREADING. WHEN EGYPTIANS ACHIEVE IT ON THEIR OWN, YOU HATE IT IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT.
Jon: THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE DON'T WANT TO CONTROL IT. IT'S NOT TRUE. WE WANT TO INFLUENCE. WE WOULD LIKE TO INFLUENCE IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
CONTROL.
Jon: YES, CONTROL. WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL.
AWR AFRAID OF -- YOU ARE AFRAID OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.
Jon: NO, NO -- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS.
HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE THAT THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WILL GAIN  CONTROL OVER THE GOVERNMENT AND USE IT AS A BASE OF RADICALISM.
Jon: DID YOU HEAR THAT? THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
YOU CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. LOTS COUNTRIES HAVE POLICIES NOT IN OUR INTEREST. FRANCE WANTS TO BUY OIL FROM IRAQ. CHINA WANTS TO SELL US TOYS MADE OF LEAD. RUSSIA WANTS TO EXTINGUISH THE SUN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY SHOULD EGYPT BE DIFFERENT?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW. JUST THE NAME MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS IN A BROTHERHOOD. IT JUST DOESN'T. [ LAUGHTER ] IF THOSE TRAVELING PANTS WERE IN A BROTHERHOOD, THE MOVIE HAVE NOT BEEN NEARLY AS WHIMSICAL.
EVEN THE YMCA, YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION SOUNDS HOSTILE.
Jon: THAT IS RIDICULOUS. IT'S FUN TO STAY AT THE YM --
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.
Jon: YOU KNOW IT'S JUST DEMOCRACY, MIDDLE EAST -- AASIF, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT IS THE MOST INSULTING WAY I COULD PUT THIS, UM -- FOX?
IS THERE ANY SUCH THING AS MODERATE ISLAM?
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT BECAUSE WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN POWER.
SO, JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU GUYS THINK THAT THIS FIRST ROUND ELECTION TO ELECT A LOWER HOUSE  OF PARLIAMENT WILL DETERMINE ONCE IN FOR ALL IF THERE'S SUCH A THING AS MODERATE ISLAM.
Jon: YES. [ LAUGHTER ]
AND THIS ELECTION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER I AS A MUSLIM AM ABLE TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY OR  IF I HAVE INHERENTLY DRAWN TO SLAUGHTER THE JEWS AROUND ME LIKE FLIES. RIGHT?
Jon: YEAH.
I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR NOT THINKING THAT EGYPTIAN LEADERS ARE DETERMINED BY WHO CAN ANSWER  THE SPHINX'S RIDDLE.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT WALKS OUR FOUR LEGS IN THE MORNING, THREE AS A BABY AND --
OH, MY GOD YOU ANSWERED IT.
Jon: IT'S A MAN.
YOU ARE NOW THE NEW PRESIDENT OF EGYPT. SUN OF A -- NO, NO, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS IS NOT A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK FOR THIS MAN.
Jon: AASIF MANDVI,
