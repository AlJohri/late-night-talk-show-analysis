[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT RECEIVED A  GOLDEN GLOBE WARD AND IS UP FOR  AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR HER ROLE IN "ZERO DARK THIRTY".
THERE ARE TWO NARRATIVES OF  THE LOCATION OF OSAMA BIN LADEN. THE ONE YOU ARE MOST FAMILIAR  WITH IS THAT YOU ARE HIDING IN A  CAVE SURROUNDED BY FIGHTERS. THAT NARRATIVE IS PRE9/11  UNDERSTANDING. THE SECOND NARRATIVE HE IS  LIVING IN THE CITY WITH MULTIPLE  POINTS OF ENTRIES AND ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS SO THAT HE CAN  KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE  ORGANIZATION. YOU CAN'T RUN A GLOBAL NETWORK  OF INTERCONNECTED CELLS FROM A  CAVE.
Jon: THEY ARE NOT  CONNECTED. PLEASE WELCOME JESSICA CHASTAIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PLEASE, SIT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US.
OF COURSE. I'M -- A HUGE FAN OF THIS SHOW.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DON'T CARE FOR IT. I DON'T WATCH IT. [ LAUGHTER ] CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I'M CONFUSED SOMEWHAT  YOU ARE DOING THIS FILM. ARE YOU NOT ON BROADWAY RIGHT  NOW?
YEAH, MAN, I HAVE TWO SHOWS  TODAY. I DID A MATINEE. I'M IN THE HEIRESS ON BROADWAY.
Jon: YOU ARE DOING THIS AND  YOU WERE AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES  AND I SAW YOU.
YES, I'M A CRAZY PERSON.
Jon: I SAY THIS BECAUSE IT  WAS EARLIER DO YOU TRAVEL BY  PNEUMATIC, TUBE?
I MIGHT END UP IN THE TUBE  LIKE THE BIRD.
Jon: TERRIBLE SITUATION. YOUR PERFORMANCE IS SO  INCREDIBLY GOOD BUT IT'S AN  UNCOMFORTABLE WATCH BECAUSE IT CHALLENGES SO MANY OF MY  PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF HOW I  FEEL ABOUT OBVIOUSLY TORTURE AND TERRORISM AND WHAT THIS COUNTRY  IS ABOUT. AND I DON'T LIKE TO BE  CHALLENGED.
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.
Jon: TELL ME IT'S GOING TO  BE OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS  THAT WHAT ATTRACTED TO YOU THIS  TYPE OF PROJECT?
I'M INTERESTED IN FILMS THAT  CREATE A CONVERSATION. THE FILM ANSWERS AN UNANSWERED  QUESTION. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY.
Jon: NO, NO, GIVE IT.
GIVE. IT ASKS WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? BY ASKING THEM THAT QUESTION YOU  ARE FORCING THEM TO PARTICIPATE? IF ART DOES THAT, IT'S DONE ITS  JOB. IT'S A GREAT FILM FOR ME TO BE  INVOLVED IN.
Jon: THERE'S MOMENTS IN  WHERE IT'S LIKE SHOULDN'T BE  WATCHING THIS 30 YEARS FROM NOW? IT'S SO IMMEDIATE TO THE CRISIS  AND CONTROVERSY. IT'S A CHIE RON THAT COMES AND  C.I.A. BLACK SITE. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW. LIKE SOMEONE IS GOING TO KICK IN  A DOOR.
IT WASN'T THE REAL BLACK  SITE. WE FILMED THAT IN --
Jon: DON'T DO THIS,  JESSICA. WERE THE OTHER GOVERNMENT AS  WEAR OF WHAT THE FILM WAS? DID YOU TELL THEM LIKE IT'S A  SEQUEL TO MEATBALLS? WHAT DID YOU TELL? YOU ARE FILMING IT OVER SEA IT'S  A VERY CONTROVERSIAL -- AMERICA  DOING SOME TRUEY --
NOT GREAT THINGS.
Jon: NOT GREAT THINGS AND  OTHER PEOPLE KILLING LOTS OF  OTHER PEOPLE.
I THINK KATHRYN BIGELOW, THE  DIRECTOR AND THE WRITER DECIDED  NOT TO WORK IN COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT. WHICH MEANT IF THEY HAD THEY  WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF  HELICOPTERS AND AIRPLANES AND EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED BUT THEY  WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE TO THE  SCRIPT TO PROVE WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT --
Jon: OUR GOVERNMENT?
IF YOU WORK WITH THE  GOVERNMENT YOU CAN USE THE PLANE  AND HELICOPTERS BUT THEY GET THE  SCRIPTS.
Jon: THE DEAL IS IF YOU LET  AWS PROVE YOUR SCRIPT YOU CAN  HAVE A HELICOPTER.
YOU CAN WORK ALONGSIDE EACH  OTHER. YES.
Jon: I'M GOING WRITE A  SCRIPT. [ LAUGHTER ] I SO BADLY WOULD LIKE A  HELICOPTER. [ LAUGHTER ]
THEY DON'T GIVE IT TO YOU  THEY LET YOU BORROW IT FOR YOUR  FILM.
Jon: THAT'S NOT THAT GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ] THE WOMAN THAT YOU PLAY IN THE  FILM. I'M USED TO THESE FILMS BEING A  DOCUDRAWMA. THIS IS A REAL CHARACTER.
THIS SAY REAL WOMAN IN THE  C.I.A. IT'S WORKING UNDERCOVER IT'S  VERY IMPORTANT WE KEEP HER  IDENTITY A SECRET. THERE'S ARTICLES WRITTEN ABOUT  HER. THE "WASHINGTON POST" DID AN  ARTICLE SAYING SHE WASN'T THE  MOST POPULAR PERSON IN THE C.I.A. AND PASSED OVER FOR  PROMOTION.
Jon: BECAUSE OF HER --
IF SOMEONE IS WRONG SHE'LL  TELL THEM. SHE DOESN'T PLAY POLITICS. SOMEONE SAID IF YOU DON'T GET A  PRE MOTION FOR FINDING OSAMA BIN  LADEN WHAT GETS YOU A PROMOTION IN THE C.I.A.?
Jon: AT LEAST GET YOU A  PLANE. DID YOU TALK TO THIS WOMAN?
NO, NO SHE'S UNDER COVER. IT'S A DANGEROUS THING.
Jon: WOULD SHE GET IN  TROUBLE?
HUGE TROUBLE. THE COVER OF NORKTS WAS ABOUT  THE C.I.A. AGENT GOING TO PRISON  FOR TALKING TO A JOURNALIST ABOUT WATERBOARDING.
Jon: YOU CAN WATERBOARD  WE'RE CALL BUT THE FIRST RULE OF  WATERBOARD CLUB.
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
Jon: INCREDIBLE. YOU SHOULD SEE IT. "ZERO DARK THIRTY". IT'S IN THE THEATERS NOW. AND SHE'S ON BROADWAY. IN THE HEIRESS
