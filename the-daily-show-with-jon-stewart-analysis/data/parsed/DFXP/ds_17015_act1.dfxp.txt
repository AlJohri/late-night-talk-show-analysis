FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLDNEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, LEGENDARY JOURNALIST TOM BROKAW AND HIS FABULOUS ELF. LAUGH WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH HERMAIN CAIN. AND THE BIGGEST STORY TO COME OUT OF THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SINCE THAT GROUP WAS  FORCED BY THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION TO GIVEUP THEIR ACRONYM. ( LAUGHTER ). YOU FEEL LUCKY, NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION? EVERY DAY WE LEARN MORE ABOUT WHETHER THE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I SEE WE HAVE ART AFICIONADOS IN THE CROWD TONIGHT. EVERY DAY, WE LEARN MORE ABOUT WHETHER THE ASSOCIATION SETTLED THE 1990 SEXUAL HARASSMENT  CHARGE LEVELED AGAINST ITS THEN-LEADER HERMAIN CAIN. AND WHEN I SAY "WE LEARN MORE," I AM INCLUDING IN THAT HERMAIN CAIN.
I AM UNAWARE OF ANY SORT OF SETTLEMENT. I HOPE IF IT WASN'T FOR MUCH BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
Jon:  THAT WAS MONDAY MORNING. ( LAUGHTER ). CLEARLY, BY MONDAY NIGHT, MR. CAIN HAD ATTENDED SOME TYPE OF AWARENESS-RAISING SEMINAR.
I WAS AWARE THAT AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED. THE WORD "SETTLEMENT" VERSUS THE WORD "AGREEMENT" YOU KNOW, I'M  NOT SURE WHAT THEY CALLED IT. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  THAT COULD THROW ANYONE OFF, I MEAN, THAT-- DID I SETTLE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE? OH, YOU MEAN THE AGREEMENT! ( LAUGHTER ) TO SETTLE THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE. I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST THE TERMINOLOGY. IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS WE CALL IT MONEY TO GO. ( LAUGHTER ) CARRY-OUT CASH. WE WRAP IT IN FOIL, SHAPE IT LIKE A SWAN. IT'S QUITE LOVELY, ACTUALLY. HOW MUCH WAS THE AGREEMENT FOR?
MAYBE THREE MONTHS' SALARY. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO MONTHS. I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT NUMBER. SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY OF THREE TO SIX MONTHS' SEVERANCE PAY.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS REPORTING THE FIRST WOMAN TO  ACCUSE MR. CAIN OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WAS PAID A ONE-YEARS' SEVERANCE PACKAGE TO LEAVE, $35,000.
Jon:  $10 MILLION IN A MASERATI! THAT IS MY FINAL OFFER. ALL I SAID TO HER WAS," WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LADIES'  NIGHT JUDGE MY PANTS?" "IN MY PANTS, THE LADIES GET IN FREE EVERY NIGHT."  ( APPLAUSE ) THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE BUSINESS MODEL. ( LAUGHTER ). PANTS WOULD NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH-- NOW, YOU MIGHT WELL ASK WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN HERMAIN  CAIN WAS REMEMBERING THINGS ABOUT THIS CASE.
YOU KNOW, WHY IS IT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REMEMBERED THINGS ABOUT IT YESTERDAY PURCHASE WERE  YOU INFORMED OR WERE YOU TOLD MORE ABOUT THE CASE YESTERDAY.
NO, NO, I I JUST REK-- I JUST STARTED TO REMEMBER MORE. LAUGH LAUGH ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  YOU KNOW, EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT HOW TRAUMATIC BEING SEXUALLY HARASSED IS, BUT NOBODY  TALKS ABOUT HOW TRAUMATIC IT IS TO BE THE HARASSER, AND YOU REPRESS A LOT OF THOSE MEMORIES. I WOULD BET HIS THERAPIST IS DELIGHTED BOOT BREAKTHROUGH THAT'S HAPPENING. ( LAUGHTER ). ( LAUGHTER ) BUT OF COURSE FOR HERMAIN CAIN, THE HARDEST PART OF THIS MORE-THAN-A-DECADE-OLD-SETTLEMENT IS DEALING WITH THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
YOU ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN GET HIT WAY SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGE.
Jon:  HE DIDN'T ALL OF A SUDDEN GET HIT WITH A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGE. THE 1990 RED SOX NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN. SECOND, WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS NOT A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHARGE. IT'S PURELY THE DISCLOSURE OF FAXUAL INFORMATION ABOUT A LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE  EMPLOYMENT HISTORY. THAT'S ALL THIS IS. THE STATEMENT HERMAIN CAIN'S TRADE ORGANIZATION REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH WOMEN WHO  ACCUSED CAIN OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, IS A FACT, NOT AN ALLEGATION. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT AN ALLEGATION LOOKS LIKE.
DO YOU THINK THAT RACE, BEING A STRONG BLACK CONSERVATIVE, HAS  ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SO CHARGED? AND IF SO, DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT?
I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  SEE, RIGHT THERE! THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FACT AND AN ALLEGATION. THE GIVEAWAY THERE IS THE REALLY THE PHRASE," WE DO NOT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT."  ( LAUGHTER ) THE THING THAT IS BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE NEWS IS A FACT. ERRGGH! ( LAUGHTER ) BUT TO BE FAIR TO HERMAIN CAIN, WHO NEEDS EVIDENCE IF THIS IS ALL A RACIST PLOT? IT'S COMMON SENSE. YOU NEVER SEE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BEING THROWN AT WHITE POLITICIANS-- WHOA. ( LAUGHTER ) IS THAT A-- IS THAT A-- IS THAT A-- ( APPLAUSE ) I'M SORRY? I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE A PICTURE OF A DACHSHUND UNDER A BLANKET. WHAT HERMAIN CAIN IS GOING THROUGH IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE'S BRACK. IT'S BECAUSE HE'S HAS BECOME THE FRONT-RUNNER. PACK WHEN RICK PERRY WAS THE FRONT-RUNNER WE FOUND OUT WHERE HE HUNTED. WHEN MICHELE BAUCHMANN WAS THE FRONT-RUNNER, WE... FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS. ( LAUGHTER ) IF YOU THINK THIS SORT OF SCRUTINY IS SOMETHING NEW BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK AND  CONSERVATIVE, BILL AYERS, JEREMIAH WRIGHT, AND YOUNG OBAMA IN MUSLIM GARB, WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FEW WORDS WITH YOU. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT I WILL AGREE WITH THOSE CONSERVATIVES ON ONE THING-- WE  SHOULDN'T LET THIS CAIN SCANDAL FROM THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION DISTRACT US FROM OTHER, MORE  TROUBLING ISSUES.
YOU VIEW CHINA AS A POTENTIAL MILITARY THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES.
YES, THEY'RE A MILITARY THREAT. THEY'VE INDICATED THEY'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR CAPABILITY  AND THEY WANT TO DEVELOP MORE AIRCRAFT CARRIERS LIKE WE HAVE. SO, YES, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM A MILITARY THREAT.
Jon:  YES. CHINA HAS INDICATED IT WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. PERHAPS AS SOON AS THE 1960s. ( LAUGHTER ) WORSE YET, I UNDERSTAND-- ( APPLAUSE ) THAT THE CHINESE AT THIS VERY  MOMENT ARE ON THE VERGE OF DEVELOPING A COOKIE THAT CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE. ( LAUGHTER ). HOW DO YOU DEFEAT AN ENEMY WHOSE PASTRIES KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT! THAT'S THE SCANDAL! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
