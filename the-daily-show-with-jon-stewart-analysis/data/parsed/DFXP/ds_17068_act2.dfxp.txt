(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU PROBABLY HEARD PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD A HIGH PROFILE MEETING WITH NETANYAHU TODAY. YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE HEARD THIS THOUGH. JON OLIVER HAS MORE.
Reporter: FOR 70 YEARS THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT HAS BEEN UTTERLY INTRACTABLE. PRESIDENT AFTER PRESIDENT HAS TRIED AND FAILED TO PROPOSE A LASTING SOLUTION. BUT RECENTLY THE PALESTINIANS ATTEMPTED A NEW TACTIC.
PALESTINE WANTS FULL MEMBERSHIP FOR THE U.N..
PALESTINIANS WANT THE U.N. TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE STATE OF PALESTINE.
Reporter: THE PROBLEM IS THAT RECOGNITION WOULD FORCE PALESTINE'S NEIGHBORS TO  ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE PALESTINE FOR A NEIGHBOR. THE PALESTINIAN AMBASSADOR SAT DOWN WITH ME TO DISCUSS THIS TRICKY SITUATION. WE BEGAN A FREE AND OPEN DIALOGUE IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY. I THINK FIRSTs IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AGREE TO PRE-CONDITIONS FOR THIS INTERVIEW.
I WILL BE WILLING TO HEAR IT, YES.
FIRST, THIS ENTIRE INTERVIEW MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH A 1967 VOCABULARY. IS THAT GROOVEY WITH YOU?
GROOVEY? IT IS AGREEABLE TO ME, YES.
Reporter: MIDDLE EAST PEACE, HERE WE COME. MOVING ON WITH THE INTERVIEW. BEFORE WE DO, IS IT HOT IN HERE?
IT'S FINE.
Reporter: YOU'RE NOT HOT. BECAUSE I'M DEFINITELY HOT.
I AM NOT.
Reporter: LOOK, AMBASSADOR I THINK BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME  TO A PROVISIONAL AGREEMENT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THIS ROOM.
IF YOU WANT TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE IT'S FINE WITH ME.
Reporter: BUT WHO IS GOING TO CONTROL THE THERMOSTAT?
THE THERMOSTAT DIRECTLY SHOULD BE SHARED BY ALL OF US.
Reporter: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT DEVOIDING THE THERMOSTAT.
WE WILL NOT DIVIDE THE THERMOSTAT BUT IT SHOULD BE ACCESSED BY ALL THOSE WHO  CHERISH IT AND THINK THAT IT IS THE ONLY PLACE.
Reporter: AFTER THREE-AND-A-HALF HOURS OF LABOR USE NEGOTIATIONS WE  FINALLY CAME TO AN AGREEMENT. WE AGREE THAT AT AN UNSPECIFIED TIME IN THE FUTURE WE WILL ANNOUNCE A SUMMIT TO  DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSING A NEGOTIATION TOWARDS AN AGREEMENT ON TEMPERATURE. YES?
YES.
Reporter: SHAKE HANDS FOR THE CAMERA. THANK YOU, AMBASSADOR. THIS IS AN HISTORIC DAY.
YES INDEED.
Reporter: YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING THAT THERMOSTAT. SO PROGRESS IS POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY THE PALESTINIAN- U.N. APPLICATION HAS WON LITTLE STAR SPANGLED OBSTACLE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS PLEDGED TO VETO ANY MOVE TOWARDS STATEHOOD.
Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE VETOING AN APPLICATION TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT EVEN HAS LIBYA, SYRIA AND NORTH  KOREA AS MEMBERS. BUT THE AMBASSADOR JUST DOESN'T GET IT.
WE HAVE 131 COUNTRIES RECOGNIZING US AS THE STATE OF PALESTINE.
Reporter: BUT HOW MANY THAT MATTER?
ALL OF THE COUNTRIES ARE IMPORTANT. WE ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS IN DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SMALL COUNTRIES AND BIG COUNTRIES. ONE COUNTRY....
Reporter: HELLO, HELLO.
WE UNDERSTAND. EVEN THE ONE COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN PRINCIPLE THEY SUPPORT THE  RECOGNITION OF THE STATE OF PALESTINE. THEY'RE JUST SAYING IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME.
Reporter: AND THAT TIME IS EMPHATICALLY NOT NOW BUT PERHAPS THERE WAS ONE OTHER  WAY WE COULD GET THEM IN. SO YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE U.N..
YES. WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE. WE ARE LIKE THE REST.
Reporter: THAT BRINGS US ON TO THE PORTION OF THIS INTERVIEW. WHO WANTS TO BE A MEMBER OF THE U.N.? WELCOME TO WHO WANTS TO BE A MEMBER OF THE U.N., THE GAME SHOW WHERE FULL MEMBERSHIP OF  THE UNITED NATIONS IS ON OFFER. I'M JOINED HERE BY ONE OF OUR CONTESTANTS. HI, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
FROM AL DESIGN.
Reporter: I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT. QUESTION NUMBER ONE. WHAT DOES U.N. STAND FOR? TAKE YOUR TIME. WHAT COULD IT BE?
UNITED NATIONS.
Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT, CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S CORRECT. HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING SO FAR?
DOING GOOD.
Reporter: OKAY. QUESTION NUMBER TWO. THAT EAGLE MEANS IT'S THE BONUS ROUND. YOU COME ALL THIS WAY. NOW DO YOU TAKE WHAT YOU'VE WON SO FAR OR DO YOU TAKE WHAT'S INSIDE THE MYSTERY BOX?
I TAKE WHAT'S INSIDE THE MYSTERY BOX.
Reporter: HE'S GOING TO GO FOR THE MYSTERY BOX. OKAY. GOOD LUCK. WHAT HAVE WE GOT? OH, I'M SORRY. IT'S A VETO FROM THE U.S.
IF WE ARE VETOED ONCE, WE WILL COME BACK AGAIN UNTIL WE PREVAIL.
Reporter: THAT'S THE SPIRIT. HE'LL COME BACK AGAIN NEXT TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING.
WE ARE DETERMINED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
Reporter: OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
