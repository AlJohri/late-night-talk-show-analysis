( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A COLUMNIST FOR THE ECONOMIC BLOG OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES."  HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED, "THE BENEFIT AND THE BURDEN, TAX REFORM WHY WE NEED IT AND WHAT  IT WILL TAKE." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, BRUCE BARTLETT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WELCOME BACK.
HAPPY TO BE HERE. GLOAN NOW, THE BENEFIT AND THE BURDEN TAX REFORM. DWRIEWR HERE ON A RED-LETTER DAY. THE PRESIDENT OAT VERY DAY YOU'RE CALLING FOR TAX REFORM HAS ANNOUNCED HE WOULD LIKE TO  CUT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE IN THIS COUNTRY FROM 35% TO 28%, CLOSE SOME LOOPHOLES AND DO A FEE FOR ANY COMPANY IN AMERICA THAT DOES THEIR BUSINESS OVERSEAS. WHAT'S YOUR FEELING ABOUT THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS?
WELL, IT SOUNDS, YOU KNOW, LIKE A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT I NOTICED, ALSO, ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO IS HAVE AN EXTRA-SPECIAL LOW RATE OF 25%  JUST FOR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. AND I THINK THAT THAT MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF TRYING TO TREAT ALL BUSINESSES EQUALLY, AND MOVES US IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF REFORM.
Jon:  NOW YOU WORKED WITH RONALD REAGAN DURING THE DAYS OF HIS HEYDAY, AND YOU SAY-- WHAT  DO YOU, REAGAN WOULD DO THISN THIS SITUATION? IN YOUR MIND WHAT, DOES HE DO IN THIS SITUATION?
WELL, WE KNOW WHAT RONALD REAGAN DID BECAUSE HE DID IT IN 1986. HE HAD A BIG STUDY DONE BY THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THEY MADE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS  AND SENT THEM TO CAPITOL HILL AND THEY DISCUSSED IT AND THEY ENDED UP LOWERING THE TOP TAX  RATE FROM 50% TO 28% BUT AMONG OTHER THINGS HE RAISED THE CAPITAL GAINS RATE FROM 20% TO  28% BECAUSE RONALD REAGAN SAID HE OUGHT TO TREAT CAPITAL GAINS, INCOME FROM CAPITAL, THE SAME AS LABOR, AND I THINK THAT'S AN IDEA THAT IS REALLY PRETTY OFF  THE TABLE TODAY.
Jon:  SO WOULD RONALD REAGAN BE TOO LIBERAL FOR TODAY'S REPUBLICAN PARTY IN  TERMS OF FINANCIAL POLICY?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS QE. EVERYBODY FORGETS ALTHOUGH HE CUT TAXES HIS FIRST YEAR HE RAISE THE THEM ALMOST EVERY  OTHER YEAR OF HIS PRESIDENCY, 11 DIFFERENT TIMES.
Jon:  BECAUSE HE WAS-- AND I THINK WE BOAST ADMIT NOW-- A COMMUNIST ( LAUGHTER )  I MEAN, WE WOULD BOTH AGREE-- HOW IS IT THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO TAX REFORM  IN THIS COUNTRY IS A GROUP CALLED AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM?
THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION. GLOAN I KNOW!
IT'S RUN BY A FRIEND OF MINE NAMED GROVER NORQUIST, AND THE  THING IS IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH TAX REFORM. THEY SUPPORT EVERY SINGLE SPECIAL TAX DEAL THAT ANYBODY EVER PROPOSES, ESPECIALLY IF  YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN, SLOPGZ IT LOWERS TAXES. THEY SAY THAT'S OKAY. LOOPHOLES, ANYTHING THAT'S A LOOPHOLE IS FINE WITH THEM, AS LONG AS IT LOWERS TAXES. BUT ONCE THE LOOPHOLE GETS PUT IN, YOU CANNOT EVER TAKE IT OUT AGAIN BECAUSE THAT'S A TAX INCREASE. I THINK THIS IS JUST LUDICROUS.
Jon:  AND THE RHETORIC IS SO COMPETING, THERE'S THIS RHETORIC OF WE HAVE A TERRIBLE  DEBT AND DEFICIT PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS UNMESSENGERRABLE. UNMANAGEABLE. IT HAS PUT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN'S CHILDREN INTO SLAVERY. THEY WILL BE STARRING IN THE INDIANA JONES MOVIE. AND, YET, THE TAX BITE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN, ESPECIALLY FOR THE UPPER INCOME GROUPS, SINCE THE 1950s.
THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. TAXES AS AWE SHARE OF THE G.D.P., HAVE NOT BEEN-- ARE AT THE LOEFT THEY'VE BEEN IN MY  LIFT, AND, OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT SUCH A YOUNG GUY.
Jon:  STOP IT! STOP IT! ( LAUGHTER ) YOU SAY THAT TO GET ANYTHING DONE, THE DEMOCRATS WILL NEED TO  GAIN COURAGE AND THE REPUBLICANS WILL NEED TO GAIN THE ABILITY TO COMPROMISE. BESIDES FROM BEING THE WORST PLOT OF A "WIZARD OF OZ" SPIN-OFF THAT I'VE EVER HEARD, WHAT IS THE LIKE HOOD-- LIKELIHOOD THAT DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN COURAGE AND REPUBLICANS  WILL GAIN COMPROMISE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( SIGHS ) ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE SPEECHLESS! YOU'RE SPEECHLESS! BECAUSE THIS IS-- ( APPLAUSE ) YOU CANNOT READ THIS BOOK WITHOUT THINK AGO ALMOST AT  EVERY PAGE, "OH, YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE. OH, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT." AND IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT PLYMOUTH COUNTIED.
IT'S NOT. THE PROBLEM IS PURELY POLITICAL. YOU HAVE, FRANKLY, ONE OF OUR POLITICAL PARTIES IS INSANE. AND WE ALL KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  AND THIS BY THE WAY COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WORKED WITH  RONALD REAGAN. THE IDEA THEN, THEY HAVE ALL GIVEN THE PRESCRIPTION 999, FLAT TAX, THE PRESIDENT-- MITT ROMNEY  CAME OUT TODAY IN FACT AND SIDE HE WANTS TO DROP THE-- NOT THE CORPORATE RATE BUT THE MARGINAL  TAX RATE ON HIGH-EARNING INDIVIDUAL DOWN TO 28%. SO HE'S SAYING OH, I SEE THE PROBLEM HERE. RICH PEOPLE PAYING TOO MUCH. LET ME TAKE CARE OF THAT. WHO DOES THAT APPEAL TO? WHAT IS THAT EVEN POLITICALLY AIMED AT?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY LOGICAL SENSE. YOU CAN ONLY INTERPRET IT WITHIN THE DYNAMICS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHERE THEY JUST-- IT'S  ESSENTIAL A PLUTOCRACY. THEY JUST WORSHIP THE RICH. THEY BELIEVE-- THEY DON'T EVEN CALL THEM THE RICH. THEY CALL THEM THE JOB CREATORS AND ENTREPRENEURS. ANY EUPHEMISM-- IT'S LIKE WITH SEX-- THERE ARE 10 ZILLION DIFFERENT WORDS FOR THESE THINGS--
Jon:  I GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, NOT SURE HOW YOU SEGUED THAT. ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WHEN-- WHEN YOU'RE AN ECONOMIST, YOU CAN DO THAT BECAUSE FOR ME, TAX REFORM  REQUEST THE IT'S LIKE SEX." NO, REALLY-- BUT YOU'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB THERE. WILL THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THE ABILITY TO, BECAUSE THEY ALSO REPRESENT SO MANY VARIED  INTERESTS, STREAMLINE THE TAX CODE IN THAT MANNER, TOO? CAN THEY PUT FORWARD SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE THIS?
NO, BECAUSE WE-- THEY NEED TO COMPROMISE. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS WILL FILIBUSTER ANYTHING THEY DON'T  LIKE, AND IT'S VERY LIKELY THEY MAY GET CONTROL OF THE SENATE THIS YEAR, TOO. >>TOO.
Jon:  WITHOUT REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION WOULD THE DEMOCRATS DO THAT? DO YOU HAVE FAITH IN THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THAT WITHOUT EVEN OPPOSITION?
NO, I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM-- ( LAUGHTER ) THE BIG PROBLEM I HAVE THE  DEMOCRATS IS THEY DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE OF THEIR OWN CONVICTIONS. THE REPUBLICANS TREAT THEM LIKE DIRT, AND THEY NEVER FIGHT BACK. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING.   ( APPLAUSE )
Jon:  THERE'S GOING TO BE A RECKONING. IT'S GOING TO GET TO SUCH A RIDICULOUS PLACE THAT THOSE TWO PARTIES ARE GOING TO FRACTURE  AND SOMETHING NEW WILL COME IN, A COLD RAIN IS-- NO? ( LAUGHTER ) YOU'RE THINKING WITH SEX AGAIN, AREN'T YOU! SON OF A GUN! ( APPLAUSE ) YOU'VE GOT TO GET THIS. YOU'LL READ IT AND GET MAD, WHICH IS GOOD. "THE BENEFIT AND THE BURDEN" ON THE BOOKSHELVES
