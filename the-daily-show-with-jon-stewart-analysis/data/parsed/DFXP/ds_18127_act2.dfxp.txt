John: WELCOME BACK. WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH  THE CRACK, LEWIS BLACK CATCHES  IT FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL "BACK IN BLACK."
WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICIANS,  YOU MIGHT SAY I'M NOT A HUGE  FAN, BUT AS A COMEDIAN, THERE'S ONE GUY I'VE COME TO LOVE.
THE THIRD AGENCY OF  GOVERNMENT I WOULD DO AWAY WITH  EDUCATION, THE... COMMERCE AND, LET'S SEE... I CAN'T. THE THIRD ONE I CAN'T. SORRY.
GOVERNOR RICK PERRY OF TEXAS,  HE'S THE GIFT WHO HAS NO IDEA HE  KEEPS GIVING. LAFTD LAUGHTER AND HE HAS GIVEN  ONCE AGAIN.
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY  TOURS THE NATION. HE'S TRYING TO LURE BUSINESSES  TO MOVE TO HIS STATE.
RICK PERRY'S TEXAS THROWDOWN  BEGAN WITH A 30-SECOND RADIO AD.
BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS WE'RE ON  THE CUTTING EDGE OF 21st  CENTURY BUSINESS LIKE AN AD ON THE RADIO. [LAUGHTER] LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.
THIS IS TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK  PERRY, AND I HAVE A WORD OF  ADVICE FOR EMPLOYERS FRUSTRATED BY ILLINOIS'S SHORT-SIGHTED  APPROACH TO BUSINESS: YOU NEED  TO GET OUT WHILE THERE'S STILL  TIME. THE ESCAPE ROUTE LEADS STRAIGHT  TO TEXAS.
THAT'S RIGHT. GOVERNOR PERRY IS TAKING OUT ADS  IN OTHER STATES TO TELL THOSE  STATES HOW MUCH THEY SUCK. [LAUGHTER] AND WHO DESERVES IT MORE THAN  ILLINOIS, A STATE THAT CAN'T  EVEN PRONOUNCE THE LETTER "S." BUT RICK PERRY'S JOB-STEALING  TOUR DIDN'T STOP THERE.
BUILDING A BUSINESS IS TOUGH,  BUT I HEAR BUILDING A BUSINESS  IN CALIFORNIA IS NEXT TO  IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK  PERRY, AND I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR  CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES: COME CHECK OUT TEXAS. [LAUGHTER]
SO NOW HE'S TAKING CALIFORNIA  JOBS. RICK PERRY DOESN'T KNOW IT, BUT  HE JUST DOUBLED TEXAS' PORN  INDUSTRY AND TRIPLED ITS NUMBER OF SKATE-BOARDING PANHANDLERS. [LAUGHTER] UNSURPRISINGLY, CALIFORNIA'S  GOVERNOR WAS NOT VERY HAPPY  ABOUT THIS.
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR JERRY  BROWN IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED THE  SPOT AND THE MEDIA.
TAKE A LITTLE RADIO AD AND  ALL YOU GUYS RUN LIKE LAP DOGS  TO REPORT IT. IT'S NOWHERE. IT'S NOT A BURP. IT'S BARELY A FART. [LAUGHTER]
AND TRUST ME, IF THERE'S  ANYTHING A MAN JERRY BROWN'S AGE  KNOWS, IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BURDEN OF PROOF --  BURP AND A FART. BUT THIS IS GREAT. AND THE BEST PART IS RICK PERRY  HAS SO MANY CRAPPY STATES TO  CHOOSE FROM -- ARIZONA, ALASKA, ARKANSAS, AND THAT'S JUST THE  "As."
FIRST IT WAS CALIFORNIA AND  ILLINOIS. THIS WEEK TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK  PERRY TOOK HIS LONE STAR SWAGGER  TO NEW YORK.
WAIT. WHAT? YOU TALKING TO US? WELL, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER NEW  YORK HERE. GO AHEAD, PERRY, TAKE YOUR BEST  SHOT.
IF YOU JUST TOOK THE BOOK OF  RULES AND REGULATIONS IN NEW  YORK STATE, IT'S 49,000 PAGES, AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS  SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TELL US  NEW YORK IS SUCH HARD PLACE TO DO BUSINESS.
MAIN STREET IS NOT LOOKING  GOOD.
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF THE SAME  OLD RECIPE OF OVERTAXATION,  OVERREGULATION AND FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION, GET OUT BEFORE YOU  GO BROKE. TEXAS IS CALLING.
TEXAS IS CALLING? WELL, GOOD THING I'VE GOT CALLER  I.D. [LAUGHTER] LISTEN, TEXAS, TRYING TO STEAL  JOBS FROM ILLINOIS AND  CALIFORNIA IS ONE THING, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO TRASH  TALK ABOUT NEW YORK? NOT ON MY WATCH. IT'S TIME TO FIGHT FIRE WITH  FIRE.
THIS IS NEW YORK, THE CITY  THAT NEVER SLEEPS. PEOPLE COME HERE FROM ALL OVER  THE WORLD FOR THE FREEDOM TO  LIVE AS THEY CHOOSE, FOR THE VARIETY OF CULTURES, BUT MOST OF  ALL FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT  TEXAS. YOU SAY EVERYTHING IS BIGGER IN  TEXAS? WE HAVE A 300-FOOT GREEN BEE CON  OF LIBERTY AND YOU HAVE A  WHATEVER THE [BLEEPED] THIS THING IS. AND WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD? WE CAN GET WHATEVER WHENEVER,  3:00 A.M., THEN HOW ABOUT AN  OMLETTE WITH A SIDE OF MEAT  LOAF? IT'S 8:00 A.M., WELL THEN I'LL  TAKE A SLICE OF PIZZA WITH SUSHI  ON IT. WHAT'S FOR LUNCH, VIETNAMESE,  CHINESE, ITALIAN? TEXAS, CAN YOU EVEN SPELL THAT? WE HAVE TWO BASEBALL TEAMS. ONE IS THE BEST IN HISTORY, AND  THE OTHER WE KEEP JUST OUT OF  PITY. YOU SAY WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH  REGULATION, WE'VE GOT WALL  STREET. THEY BREAK THE LAW FOR A LIVING  AND NEVER GET PUNISHED. NEW YORKERS GO TO THE BATHROOM  ANYWHERE THEY WANT. WE LOVE THE SMELL OF URINE. IT SMELLS LIKE FREEDOM. I'M LEWIS BLACK. NEW YORK IS MY CITY. I SHARE IT WITH 8 MILLION PROUD,  AMAZING PEOPLE.
THIS IS MY CITY.
THIS IS OUR CITY.
THIS IS OUR CITY.
NEW YORK, OUR CITY.
THIS IS MY [BLEEPED] CITY.
WE MAY ALL COME FROM  DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT WE ALL  AGREE ON ONE THING. [BLEEPED], TEXAS. [BLEEPED], TEXAS.
[BLEEPED], TEXAS.
NO, NO, NO, NO TEXAS.
RICK PERRY, YOU ARE A  SCHMUCK.
REMEMBER THE ALAMO? NEITHER DO WE. [BLEEPED] TEXAS.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGES]
DON'T MESS WITH TEXAS? NO, DON'T [BLEEPED] WITH NEW  YORK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M LEWIS BLACK. AND I APPROVED THIS MESSAGE. JOHN?
John: THANK YOU, LEWIS. LEWIS BLACK, EVERYBODY. WE'L
