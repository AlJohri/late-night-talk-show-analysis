[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SIMPLE  RULE IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN ONE  REGION GETS HIT A NATURAL DISASTER EVERYBODY PITCHES IN. PRIVATE SECTOR, INDIVIDUAL  ZENDZ, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  STEPS IN. AFTER HURRICANE SANDY HIT THE  NORTHEAST SOME REPUBLICANS IN  CONGRESS THOUGHT IT WAS TIME FOR THE RULES TO CHANGE.
CONGRESSMAN FROM SOUTH  CAROLINA SAYING HE'S NOT GOING  TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE.
MY DIFFICULTY WITH IT IS IT'S  NOT PAID FOR. WE'RE BORROWING THIS ADDITIONAL  MONEY TO DO THIS. IT'S WRONG.
IT'S DPUL OF PORK AND IT'S  NOT PAID FOR.
Jon: THAT'S CRAZY. YOU YOU ARE A MAN FROM SOUTH  CAROLINA YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM  PUTTING ANYTHING IN PORK. FOR GOD'S SAKES. SOUTH CAROLINA HAS A PORK-BASED  ECONOMY. YOUR STATE HAD NO PROBLEM  ACCEPTING AID AFTER HUGO AND  GAFTON. TURNS OUT THERE'S REPUBLICAN  OFFICIALS IN THE NORTHEAST AND  THEY WOULD LIKE A WORD WITH YOU  FOLKS.
TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE FROM  STATES WITH DISASTERS RECENTLY  WHO DECIDED WE NEED CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME, SHAME ON YOU.
NEW JERSEY DOES NOT EXPECT  ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT WAS DONE  FOR LOUISIANA, ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI IN KATRINA. IF THEY WANT TO MAKE NEW RULES  ABOUT DISASTER, WELL, THEY  PICKED THE WRONG STATE TO MAKE THE NEW RULES WITH.
Jon: MY STATE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE STATE YOU REPRESENTING. BE A REAL SHAME FIT ENDED UPPING  LIKE NEW DELAWARE. YOU NEVER HEARD OF NEW DELAWARE? THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT IS THE HOLD UP? WHAT IS THE PORK?
THERE'S STUFF FOR ALASKA  FISHERIES. THERE'S THINGS FOR THE KENNEDY  SPACE CENTER. THERE'S THE ROOF ON THE  SMITHSONIAN. JOB TRAINING.
Jon: BACK UP. THERE'S NO ROOF ON THE  SMITHSONIAN. IT'S GOING TO RAIN ON ARCHIE  BUNKER'S CHAIR. CONGRESS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO  THROUGH THIS TO GET MEASURES  PASSED. CAN'T YOU TAKE THE PORK STUFF  OUT OF THERE AND PASS A TRIMMED  DOWN VERSION OF THE BILL.
THE REPUBLICANS PASSED A  TRIMMED DOWN VERSION OF THE BILL  YESTERDAY. IT INCLUDED NOT JUST RELIEF FOR  SANDY BUT DAMAGED FISHERIES IN  ALASKA AND THE GULF COAST.
Jon: YOU WORKED ON A  REASONABLE COMPROMISE TO GET  HELP TO PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT. I'M SO IMPRESSED I WANT TO MAKE  THIS THE FIRST OF THE NEW  SEGMENT "THANK| YOU FOR NOT TRIPPING OVER YOUR OWN  (bleep)."  IT'S NOT THAT HARD. THAT WAS THE HOUSE WHERE THE  CRAZY REPRESENTATIVES LIVE. I'M SURE NOW THE SENATE WILL  HAVE NO PROBLEM APPROVING THIS  PAIRED DOWN DISASTER RELIEF EVEN WITHOUT THE FISHERY MONEY.
I SAY POINT BLANK THIS  LEGISLATION IS NOT GOING TO PASS  WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF THIS FISHERY MONEY POINT BLANK AND  PERIOD.
Jon: GREAT IT'S BACK TO T
