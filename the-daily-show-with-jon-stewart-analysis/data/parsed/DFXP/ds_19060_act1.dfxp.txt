FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY  SHOW WITH JON STEWART!   [APPLAUSE] JON:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, [APPLAUSE] JON:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART.   WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.   OUR GUEST TONIGHT, TORONTO STAR  REPORTER ROBYN DOOLITTLE, HAS  WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT --  [LAUGHTER] A GENTLEMAN NAMED ROB FORD,  APPARENTLY HE'S THE MAYOR OF  TORONTO AND A CRACK AFICIONADO. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT FIRST:
A STUNNING REPORT JUST RELEASED BY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE.
A POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE  CONGRESSIONAL REPORT.
A BIG NEW REPORT.
OH, MY GOD!   COULD IT BE TRUE?   HAVE THEY ACTUALLY RELEASED THE  BIANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET  OFFICE'S OUTLOOK ON THE BUDGET  AND ECONOMY ENTITLED THE BUDGET  AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 2014 TO  2024, APPENDIX -- [SNORING]   LABOR MARKET EFFECTS OF THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, A JACK REACHER MYSTERY.   I CAN'T BELIEVE I FELL ASLEEP  DURING THAT.   I WAS NEARLY A THIRD OF THE WAY  THROUGH THE TITLE.   I WONDER WHY THERE'S SO MUCH  EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE CBO REPORT.
CBO'S PROJECTING THAT THIS THE DEBACLE  WILL COST NEARLY  2 1/2 MILLION JOBS.
IS OBAMACARE KILLING THE  AMERICAN DREAM.
HIGHER DEFICITS
AN EXTRA 1 TRILLION DOLLARS  ADDED TO THE DEFICIT.
10 TRILLION DOLLARS TO THE  DEFICIT.
THEY WILL EMPLOY FAR FEWER  FULL-TIME PEOPLE, MORE PART-TIME PEOPLE.
IS THIS IS THE AMERICAN WAY?   I'M NOT SURE.
YOU SEEMED PRETTY SURE THAT  IT'S NOT.   BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE SMALL PROBLEM  WITH THE APOCALYPTIC PREDICTIONS FROM THE CBO IN THAT THE REPORT  DID NOT IN ANY WAY SAY ANY OF  THOSE THINGS. [LAUGHTER]
THE NET EFFECTS OF THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS TO REDUCE OUR NATIONAL DEFICITS, ISN'T  THAT RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN.
YOU POINT OUT THERE'S NO  COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT  PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT HAS  INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, IS THAT  RIGHT?
YES, THAT'S RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN.
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS ISN'T  EMPLOYERS CUTTING JOBS, NEWLY  EMPOWERED WORKERS CHOOSING TO GO A DIFFERENT PATH.
YES.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GUY WHO IS READY TO GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF  THERE. [LAUGHTER]
SO THE THREE MAIN TALKING POINTS AGAINST OBAMACARE, ARE, ACCORDING TO  THE CBO, NOT TRUE.   I THINK WE KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. ♪ ♪ AY! THE STORM CLOUDS GATHERED  QUICKLY THAT DAY ON THE BULLS#%T MOUNTAIN.   AS WORD SPREAD THAT THIS NEW  OBAMACARE ACT WOULD HELP END  JOB LOCK, A SCOURGE AFFECTING MANY  FAMILIES WHO DON'T TAKE  ENTREPRENEURIAL CHANCES OR STAY  IN DEAD END JOBS SO THE TUMOR ON THEIR ARSE DOESN'T LEAVE THEM  HOMELESS.   IN FACT, JOB LOCK IS SOMETHING  THE RESIDENTS OF BULL[BLEEP] MOUNTAIN USED TO OPPOSE.
THE KEY QUESTION THAT OUGHT  TO BE ADDRESSED IN ANY HEALTH  CARE REFORM LEGISLATION IS ARE  WE GOING TO CONTINUE JOB LOCK OR ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW  INDIVIDUALS MORE CHOICE AND  PORTABILITY TO FIT THE 21st  CENTURY WORK FORCE?
JEEZ, MORE CHOICE, SEEMS  PRETTY GOOD.   AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF THAT  STATEMENT?   NOW THAT WE FIND OUT THE NEW  HEALTH CARE LAW DOES JUST THAT.
BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT  POLICIES, AS THE WELFARE STATE  EXPANDS, THE INCENTIVE TO WORK  DECLINES.
IT ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZES INDIFFERENCE.
NOW IT'S FREE MEDICAL CARE  THROWN AT EXTRA MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO GO  ON THAT AND NOT WORK.
THE GOVERNMENT IS EFFECTIVELY INCENTIVIZING AMERICANS TO STOP  WORKING.
YOU KNOW, LIKE SOCIAL  SECURITY INCENTIVIZES AMERICANS  TO NOT DIE AT THEIR JOBS. WELL HEY-- IT'S NICE TO WITNESS THE BIRTH OF A NEW TALKING POINT. IF GIVING SOMEONE HEALTH CARE IS ALL IT TAKES TO GET PEOPLE TO STOP  SHOWING UP TO WORK, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T CHIP IN AND GET LOU DOBBS SOME HEALTH CARE.   AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE-- [APPLAUSE] AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT THESE LAZY POORS, WHO HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND BIDING TIME AT THEIR TWO JOBS, JUST WAITING FOR THE DAY THEY CAN RIDE THE UNCLE SUGAR TRAIN TO MEDICAID TOWN ARE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR NEW FOUND  WINDFALL.
OBAMACARE IS A DISINCENTIVE  TO WORK. THE CBO ADMITTED IT THIS  AFTERNOON.   WHY DON'T YOU JUST SPEND MORE  TIME WITH THE FAMILY, LET  SOMEBODY ELSE WORK, YOU GO ON  OBAMACARE? STAY HOME, SPEND MORE TIME  WITH THE FAMILY, LET SOMEBODY ELSE PAY FOR YOUR  HEALTH CARE. >>Jon: YEAH, SPEND TIME  WITH YOUR FAMILY, HELP RAISE  YOUR CHILDREN IN A MORE HANDS ON FASHION, CREATE STABILITY.   WHAT THE HELL.   YOU'RE CONSERVATIVES, I THOUGHT  YOU GUYS LOVED FAMILY.
FAMILY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT  INSTITUTION IN SOCIETY.
A GOOD CORE FAMILY UNIT.
PROTECTING THE FAMILY IS THE  SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF  OUR AGENDA. THE MOST IMPORTANT-- FAMILY MUST  BE PROTECTED FROM ASTEROIDS, NUCLEAR WEAPONS, DUDES IN LOVE. THEY HAVE TO BE PROTECTED.   NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, WHEN  FAMILY CLASHES WITH CAPITALISM  AROUND THE HOLIDAYS,  CONSERVATIVES THROW FAMILY  OVERBOARD, YO, CAPITALISM, GOT  YOUR BACK, BRO.
MANY RETAILERS ARE OPENING DOORS THIS THANKSGIVING NOT EVEN WAITING  FOR BLACK FRIDAY.
FOR A LONG TIME INTO MY CAREER I WORKED ALL THE HOLIDAYS CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
IF YOU'RE A RETAILER YOU OPEN DOORS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE GO OUT, SPEND AND GUESS WHAT?   IT'S NOT SO MUCH LIKE DITCHING  YOUR FAMILY.  ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS IS TO GO WITH THE FAMILY, CREATE CAPITALISM, KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING.
HE'S RIGHT.   SOME OF MY FONDEST MEMORIES AS A CHILD WERE CREATING CAPITALISM  WITH MY FATHER.   YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING, I  REMEMBER, HE USED TO COME IN TO  MY ROOM AND GO HEY, SON, WANT TO GO OUT AND CREATE CONSUMER  CONFIDENCE AND BRICKS AND MORTAR RETAIL SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY?   YOU MEAN IT, POPS, YOU MEAN IT?  I SURE DO, SON, GRAB SOME  LIQUIDITY AND MEET ME  DOWNSTAIRS.   BY THE WAY, I'M NOT BANGING YOUR NANNY.   I'M EXPLORING BURGEONING  MARKETS.   AND THE CASH IN THE CRADLE AND  THE SILVER SPOON.   IN FACT, WATCH THIS LEGO NEWS ANCHOR TRY AND TEACH HIS CO-HOST THE TRUE  MEANING OF THE HOLIDAYS.
I'M DOWN WITH THE CLOSING THE STORES ON THANKSGIVING.   IT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.   I'M SERIOUS.
REALLY?   SERIOUSLY?
WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED?
FREE ENTERPRISE.
YOU KNOW, LOOK, PEOPLE SHOULD BE AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES.  THAT'S MY LITTLE OPINION.   I'M NOT THE LAW ON THIS.
OKAY, I WAS JUST THINKING OF  CAPITALISM AND FREE MARKETS AND  LETTING PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
SOMEHOW I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD SPEND THANKSGIVING WITH THEIR  FAMILIES TURNS IN TO I GUESS, IF YOU'RE A COMMUNIST.   [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE APPARENTLY ON [BLEEP]  MOUNTAIN CORPORATIONS AREN'T  JUST PEOPLE, THEY'RE BETTER  PEOPLE THAN YOU.   CORPORATIONS ARE THE GOOD  PEOPLE, NOT THE JACK ASS  TWO-LEGGED KIND WHO DON'T WANT  TO MAN THE PERFUME COUNTER AT  MACY'S BECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS  EVE.   IT'S JUST LIKE THAT INSPIRING  SCENE IN BRAVEHEART.
THEY CAN TAKE OUR LIVES BUT  THEY CAN NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM  TO WORK AT BEST BUY OVER THE  HOLIDAYS!   OVERTIME!    WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
