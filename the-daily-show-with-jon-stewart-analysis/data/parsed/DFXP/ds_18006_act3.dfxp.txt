(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT IS AN ACTOR AN FINE  DIRECTOR. HIS NEW FILM WHICH HE DIRECTED  AND STARS IN IS CALLED "ARGO."
THEY CAN'T RIDE BICYCLES OR  WE'RE PREPARED TO SEND IN  SOMEBODY TO TEACH THEM.
OR YOU COULD JUST SEND IN  TRAINING WHEELS AND MEET THEM AT  THE BORDER WITH GATORADE.
IT'S 300 MILES.
TURKISH BORDER. THEY'D NEED A SUPPORT TEAM  FOLLOWING THEM.
WE WERE JUST ASKED TO SHARP  SHOOT THIS.
I'M SORRY, WHO IS THIS?
HE'S GOT A LOT OF THE SHAWS  PEOPLE OUT. IT'S WINTER.
CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT AROUND  TILL SPRING. THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE CITY IS  THE AIRPORT. THEY BUILD NEW COVER IDENTITIES  FOR THEM, TAKE THEM OUT ON A  COMMERCIAL FLIGHT.
Jon: I REMEMBER SMOKING IN  MEETINGS. (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW  BEN AFFLECK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOUNG MAN, DESPITE THE  WIZ BANG NATURE OF THAT CLIP,  THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT IN  THE MOVIE.
IT'S VERY SUSPENSEABLE. IT'S A -- NOT A BUREAUCRACY  MOVIE.
Jon: NOT A BUREAUCRACY MOVIE  AT ALL. I HAVE A LOT OF ACTORS ON THE  MOVIE. NOT A TON, BUT A FEW. ENOUGH.
SURE.
Jon: AND I OFTEN TIMES WILL  LIE TO THEIR FACES. WILL SAY TO THEM --  (LAUGHTER)  "WELL, THIS IS A TREMENDOUS WORK  YOU'VE DONE" AND THE ACTOR HUGH  GRANT COMES TO MIND. (LAUGHTER)  (AUDIENCE REACTS)  I WATCHED THE FILM TODAY. PHENOMENAL. PHENOMENAL. SUSPENSEFUL. INTERESTING. WELL RESEARCHED, WELL ACTED,  WELL DIRECTED. THE ENERGY OF IT. DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE  MIDDLE OF THIS --
I'M DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NO, NO, I WAS INCREDIBLY  IMPRESSED WITH THE FILM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. I THINK THE ACTORS ONLY RARELY  LIE TO YOUR FACE.
Jon: WHAT?
HAD A GREAT TIME, THANKS,  GOOD TO SEE YOU. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE.
YES?
Jon: TO DO A FILM ABOUT IRAN  IN 1979, WHERE DID THIS STORY  EVEN COME FROM? I'VE LIVED IN THIS COUNTRY A  LONG TIME, I NEVER HEARD OF IT.
IT'S A TRUE STORY. IT HAPPENED OBVIOUSLY AROUND THE  HOSTAGE ERA, DURING THE LARGER  HOSTAGE CRISIS. SIX PEOPLE GOT OUT. THEY ESCAPED, THEY HID OUT WITH  THE CANADIANS, THEY WERE RESCUED  BY A C.I.A. OFFICER WHO TEAMED  UP WITH FOLKS IN HOLLYWOOD. THEY PRETENDED TO BE A -- LIKE A  SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE CREW TO GO  BACK AND GET THEM OUT OF TEHRAN. IT'S LIKE A HORRIBLE MOVIE IF IT  WASN'T TRUE, YOU KNOW WHAT I  MEAN? BUT IT'S TENSE AND FUNNY AND  EXCITING AND I JUST GOT THIS --  A GUY READ THIS -- JOSH BIERMAN  FOUND THE DECLASSIFIED MATERIALS, A BRILLIANT WRITER  THEN WROTE A SCRIPT FROM IT,  THEY SENT IT TO ME, IT SEEMED  CLEAR THAT EVEN JUST WITH THE MOST FEEBLE EXECUTION I COULD DO  SOMETHING SPECIAL. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BUT THIS IS NOT -- THIS  IS NOT FEEBLE, YOU CLEARLY HAVE  WORKED OUT. THERE WAS A SCENE IN THE MOVIE  WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT'S KIND OF A TRADEMARK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, AT  THE TIME I WAS SAYING "AH, IT'S  A LITTLE GRATUITOUS."
I SHOWED THAT TO SOME OF THE  PRODUCERS AND IT WAS ME GETTING  OUT OF THE SHOWER AND TOWELING  OFF.
Jon: THE WHOLE THING, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE ANY  NOTES EXCEPT DO YOU WANT TO TELL  HIM OR SHOULD I? YOU KNOW, THIS SHOWER SCENE MAY  BE --.
Jon: CLOSE IT DOWN A LITTLE  BIT THERE.
JUST A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
Jon: DID YOU MEET THE FOREIGN  SERVICE WORKERS THAT WERE IN THE  EMBASSY IN IRAN? ARE THEY ALIVE?
I DID. THERE ARE FIVE OF THE SIX  HOUSEGUESTS WHO WERE THERE, THE  DIPLOMATS WHO DID THE FAMILY  MEMBERS OF CHAMBERS, THE GUY WHO ALAN ARKIN PLAYED. MY CHARACTER I WORKED WITH VERY  CLOSELY. SO WE HAD THIS NUCLEUS OF PEOPLE  ON HOW TO KEEP IT REAL AND ALSO  TO TOLD ME THAT THIS IS IN FACT  IN MART A TRIBUTE TO THE DANGERS OUR DIPLOMATS FACE, OUR FOREIGN  SERVICE PEOPLE FACE WITHOUT ANY  HOPE FOR RECOGNITION. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IN BENGHAZI WE  SAW THE TRAGIC RESULT THERE. AND THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING  THAT -- YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO  YOUR FAMILY, BEING AWAY FROM  YOUR WIFE AND KIDS, ALL THIS TOUGH STUFF. SO WHEN I SAW THAT STUFF  HAPPENING I SAID SILVER LINING  FOR ME ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS WE  WERE HONORED TO MAKE IT.
Jon: WHAT'S AMAZING TO ME--  AND IT'S ALWAYS STRUCK ME-- IS  NO MATTER HOW THE SITUATION IS  IN ANY COUNTRY, HOW CHAOTIC, HOW VOLATILE CANADIAN CANS TRAVEL  FREELY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THERE'S GUYS IN THE STREETS WITH  MACHINE GUNS BLOWING EACH OTHER  AWAY, CHAOS IN THE STREET AND SUDDENLY A CAR PULLS IN WITH TWO  CANADIAN FLAGS AND THEY JUST  DRIVE IN.
GO ON, GO ON. (LAUGHTER)  I DIDN'T REALIZE. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIOLENT  REVOLUTION BUT YOU'RE CANADIAN,  YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE, GO ON. REMARKABLE.
THEY'RE A PEACEFUL PEOPLE. THEY'RE A KNOWN PEACEFUL PEOPLE. THIS IS A BIG -- YOU KNOW, WE  WORKED TOGETHER WITH THEM. THEY HOUSED OUR FOLKS, SAVED OUR  LIVES. IT WAS INTERNATIONAL  COOPERATION. ALL OF THE GOOD THINGS WE LIKE  TO SEE. AND HIDING UNDER THE SHELTER OF  CANADIANS WHICH IS -- THAT'S US,  THAT'S AMERICA, HIDE BEG THIBD  CANADIANS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK  THEY WILL ENJOY THAT  INTERPRETATION. VERY MUCH SO FROM WHAT I CAN  UNDERSTOOD. THIS DIRECTING THING, THOUGH, I  WOULD CONTINUE TO DO THIS.
KAPUT?
Jon:, BEAUTIFUL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT.
Jon: "ARGO" IS IN THE  THEATERS FRIDAY. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS THING.
