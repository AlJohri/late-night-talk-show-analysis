FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME JON STEWART. GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. ANITA HILL IS JOINING US. SHE'S THE SUBJECT OF THE NEW DOCUMENTARY "ANITA." SHE'LL BE JOINING US. LAST WEEK WE MENTIONED ON THE SHOW THAT WHATEVER THIS FOX NEWS THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON HOW POOR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM AND ABUSING THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR SURPRISINGLY RAVENOUS SEAFOOD ADDICTIONS.
PEOPLE USING FOOD STAMPS TO BUY GOURMET CRAB LEGS.
YOU CAN USE EBT CARDS AT THE ORGANIC MARKET IN THE EAST VILLAGE. YOU CAN GET ORGANIC WILD SALMON. IT'S INSANITY.
Jon: THEY CAN GET WILD SALMON IN THE EAST VILLAGE. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID POOR PEOPLE'S SALMON SHOULD COME IN A CAN FROM AN OUTER BOROUGH. I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW YOUNG I LOOKED. BEEN A TOUGH WEEK. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY APPARENTLY THIS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE OBSERVATION DREW THE IRE OF ONE ERICLES BOLLINGSWORTH.
TAKE A LISTEN TO JON STEWART MOCKING ALL OF US AT FOX NEWS FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON FOOD STAMP ABUSE. LET ME SCHOOL YOU, MR. STEWART.
Jon: OH, SCHOOL. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I'M READY FOR CLASS PROFESSOR. WAIT. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR YOU. SCHOOL ON PROFESSOR.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE IN A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS.
Jon: OH I'M SORRY. I SEE THE DISCONNECT. YOU THOUGHT WE WERE RIDICULING YOU FOR EXPOSING GOVERNMENT WASTE. NO, THAT'S A REASONABLE THING TO EXPOSE. WE WERE RIDICULING THE WAY YOU EXAGGERATE THE SCOPE OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE ABUSE THROUGH RANDOM OFTEN UNPROVABLE ANECDOTES, HOUR LONG SPECIALS AND FOR SOME REASON THIS HAND BURSTING THROUGH THE HEART OF AMERICAN BEFORE APPRENTLY REACHING INTO AMERICA'S POCKETS FOR TAX PAYER LOBSTER AND TITTY BAR MONEY. GET A JOB YOU TITTY BAR LOBSTER EATING HAND. [LAUGHTER] YOU SEE YOUR FAIR NETWORK HAS CREATED THE VERY BALANCED NARRATIVE THAT TIES PEOPLE'S POVERTY TO THEIR OWN LACK OF VIRTUE AND SAYS THAT PROGRAMS CREATED TO SERVE THE IMPOVERISHED ARE IN FACT THE REASON THAT THOSE ARE STILL IMPOVERISHED. SORT OF IDEA IF THEY WEREN'T SUCH (bleep) PEOPLE THEY WOULDN'T BE POOR AND THOSE FOOD STAMPS ARE JUST MAKING THEM (bleep). OF COURSE, YOU  DIDN'T SAY IT SO ELEGANTLY.
FOOD STAMP ABUSERS, FEEDING ON TAXPAYERS.
AMERICA'S POOR ARE ACTUALLY LIVING THE GOOD LIFE.
AMERICA'S CULTURE OF DEPENDENCY.
OUR LIBERAL GOVERNMENT IS TEACHING OUR KIDS TO BE TAKERS INSTEAD OF MAKERS.
MOOCHERS.
PARASITES SUCKING OFF THE NIPPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT.
FREELOADING.
DRAINING THIS SOCIETY.
99% OF THEM HAVE A REFRIGERATOR.
Jon: WHAT? ( LAUGHTER ). YES, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO FINISH THIS MILK TODAY. I'M GOING TO PUT IT BACK IN HERE UNTIL TOMORROW. IT'S GOOD TO BE THE KING. [LAUGHTER] NOT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR EXAMPLES OF FOOD STAMP WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE LIKE THIS GUY, SURFER GUY HE'S IN SOME BAND AND HIS FOOD STAMP CRIMES WERE SO EGREGIOUS HE WAS FEATURED ON SIX DIFFERENT FOX SHOWS.
HE USED HIS EBT CARD, HE WALKED INTO THE SUPERMARKET AND BOUGHT LOBSTER.
THIS GUY SAY PARASITE. HE IS A RAT.
Jon: WELL, TECHNICALLY YOU ARE EITHER A RAT OR A PARASITE YOU CAN'T BE BOTH. A RAT IS A SCAVENGER WHO COULD CARRY PARASITES. IN FACT,  IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW SKIPPY AND THE TICK IT'S ABOUT A FASTIDIOUS MOUSE WHO LIVES WITH A VERY SLOPPY TICK. HE GETS INTO  NICKELODEAN NEVER PICKED IT UP. IT WAS A KIDS SHOW. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOLD. I STILL HAVE THE STORY BOARDS. MY POINT IS THIS. CONGRATULATIONS ON FINDING YOUR FOOD STAMP ABUSE BIGFOOT. THAT ONE GUY YOU FOUND IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMEONE THAT THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM ITSELF WOULD PROBABLY POINT TO AS ITS GREATEST SUCCESS STORY BUT WE MAKE FUN OF YOU NOT FOR FINDING HIM BUT FOR PRETENDING THAT HE SOMEHOW REPRESENTS LITERALLY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. I KNOW I'M BEING PURPOSEFULLY HYPERBOLIC.
HE IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF LITERALLY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.
Jon: SORRY I MEANT HYPER BOLLING. LET'S TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD. PERHAPS YOU ARE MERELY A WATCHDOG FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND LIKE WATCH DOGS YOU DO OCCASIONALLY BARK AT BURGLARS BUT MOSTLY JUST THE DISHWASHER AND SHADOWS. FOR INSTANCE,, WHAT IS THE WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE IN THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM?
MORE THAN $3 BILLION HAS BEEN LOST TO TRAFFICKING. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS EACH YEAR.
Jon: THAT AIN'T NOTHING. THAT IS A LOT AND I IMAGINE WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT $3 BILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU AND I KNOW NUMBERS. I KNOW YOU KNOW NUMBERS. I ASSUME YOU KNOW I KNOW NUMBERS.
Jon: OKAY, FINE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO KNOWING NUMBERS AND HATING WASTE AND FRAUD AS YOU DO. WHEN DEMOCRATS WERE LOOKING TO RAISE $1 TRILLION IN REVENUE IN PART BY ENDING THE WASTEFUL $4 BILLION IN TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES THAT GO TO ALREADY PROFITABLE OIL COMPANIES YOU SAID WHAT?
THE TAX BREAKS OR LOOPHOLES OR TAX CREDITS YOU GIVE TO OIL COMPANIES AMOUNT TO $4 BILLION A YEAR. THEIR A PITTANCE COMPARED TO WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, $4 BILLION IS A PITTANCE, A PITTANCE FOR THE REFRIGERATOR SET. [ LAUGHTER ] SO WHAT I HAVE LEARNED TODAY FROM MY TEACHER IS THAT $3 BILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY IS GREATER THAN $4 BILLION IN TAXPAYER MONEY. I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE. I THINK WE'RE DONE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU ARE THE WORST MATH TEACHER I EVER HAD SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DO THE BIT ANYMORE. BUT (bleep) IT WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING THE BIT. LET'S KEEP GOING. IS $3 BILLION GREATER THAN THIS?
THE UNITED STATES LOSES AN ESTIMATED $150 BILLION ANNUALLY TO TAX AVOIDANCE SCHEMES INVOLVING TAX HAVENS.
A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE ONLY PAYING HALF THE CURRENT TAX RATE FOR CORPORATIONS AND SOME AREN'T PAYING ANY INCOME TAXES AT ALL.
SOME COMPANIES HAD SO MANY TAX BREAKS THEIR TAX BURDEN WENT NEGATIVE MEANING THEY GOT MONEY BACK.
Jon: WHICH THEY USED TO HIRE LOBBYISTS TO CREATE MORE TAX LOOPHOLES AND IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF SURFER GUY IS A PARASITE AND A RAT AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT CORPORATIONS THAT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF OUR TAX LAWS AND AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. I GOT MY MONEY ON LEECH VULTURES.
WHETHER THEY NEED IT OR NOT IT WAS AVAILABLE SO THEY WENT AND GOT IT. WHY DO WE VILIFY? WHY DO WE LOOK FOR THESE COMPANIES? THEY TOOK CHEAP MONEY.
I PAY ALL THE TAXES THAT ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED NOT A DOLLAR MORE. I DON'T THINK YOU WANT SOMEONE AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO PAYS MORE TAXES THAN HE OWES.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEMONIZE SUCCESS. EVERY ONE OF US WALKS INTO H AND R BLOCK IN APRIL AND TAKES EVERY DEDUCTION AVAILABLE US TO. IF THEY ARE DOING IT LEGALLY WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT? THAT IS WRONG WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT SET UP THE TAX CODE THAT IS SO CONVOLUTED AND THEY WROTE IN THOSE LOOPHOLES.
IT'S COMPLETELY LEGAL, AND GOOD FOR THEM.
Jon: JUST TO BE CLEAR SO ON (bleep) MOUNTAIN THIS (bleep)'S NARCISSISM REPRESENTS ALL THE AMERICANS WHO ARE IMPOVERISHED AND NEED FOOD ASSISTANCE BUT THESE (bleep)'S NARCISSISM REPRESENTS ALL THAT IS GOOD AND DECENT ABOUT AMERICA. WHY THE DISTINCTION?
AS THE RICH GET RICHER, IT FLOATS ALL BOATS.
LET OUR JOB CREATORS KEEP MORE OF WHAT WE EARN AND PRODUCE SO WE CAN HIRE MORE PEOPLE AND THAT WILL GET THE ECONOMY ROLLING ALONG.
WE SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHING THE JOB CREATORS.
EMPLOY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. WHY GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JOB CREATORS.
Jon: JUST BECAUSE THEY OCCASIONALLY ALSO DESTROY THE ECONOMY. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT AT LEAST HALF THE TIME THEY ARE CREATING JOBS. IF ONLY THERE WAS ONE STORY THAT COULD EXEMPLIFY THE CORPORATE GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE JOB CREATION NEXUS.
JP MORGAN CHASE PROVIDES FOOD STAMP DEBIT CARDS IN 26 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THE FIRM IS PAID PER CUSTOMER AND IN THE STATE OF INDIANA JP MORGAN MAKES ROUGHLY $186,000 PER MONTH.
Jon: WHOA IN FACT IT'S KIND OF GENIUS. SINCE 2004 18 OF THE 24 STATES JP MORGAN HANDLES HAVE BEEN CONTRACTED TO PAY THE COMPANY OVER $560 MILLION. IT'S A BRILLIANT BUSINESS MODEL. YOU MAKE A TON OF MONEY SELLING SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND DERIVATIVES AND THEN WHEN THAT BUSINESS CRASHES THE ECONOMY AND MILLIONS OF HOMEOWNERS FIND THEMSELVES UNDERWATER AND FORECLOSED UPON AND HAVE TO GO ON FOOD STAMPS YOU GET A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT TOO. BUT DON'T THINK OF IT AS JP MORGAN SHORTING HOMEOWNERS THINK OF THEM AS GOING LONG ON HUNGER. [LAUGHTER] BUT I ASSUME THEY THEN PUT SOME OF THAT MONEY THAT THEY GOT INTO CREATING JOBS FOR THE FEW NONLAZY AMERICANS LEFT.
TO SAVE MONEY, JP MORGAN HAS BEEN ROUTING BENEFIT CARD CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL TO INDIA WHERE EMPLOYEES REPORTEDLY EARN NO MORE THAN $3.50 AN HOUR.
Jon: WELL THAT MAKES SENSE. YOU DON'T WANT TO HIRE AMERICANS THAT WOULD CUT INTO YOUR LUCRATIVE FOOD STAMP BUSINESS. YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN YOUR BASE. SO WHAT I'M GETTING FROM FOX IS THIS, EXPLOITING GOVERNMENT LARGESSE WHILE REPREHENSIVE AND MORALLY CORRUPTING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IS OKAY FOR CORPORATIONS. MAYBE THIS WILL HELP. DON'T THINK ABOUT FOODSTAMPS AND HEADSTART AND PROGRAMS LIKE THAT AS FEEDING AND HELPING A SMALL CHILD. THINK ABOUT IT AS INVESTING IN A PROMISING START-UP WITH A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
