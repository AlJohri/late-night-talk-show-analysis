FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE GREAT BILL MAHER. BILL MAHER WILL BE JOINING US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BUT FIRST, WE TURN TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE A GROUP OF SUNNI ISLAMIST MILITANTS HAVE FORMED A NATION START-UP LOOKING TO GAIN MARKET SHARE IN IRAQ. THE GROUP IS CALLED ISIS, NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THEIR EARLY '90s INCARNATION, VANILLA ISIS. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT HAS NOW HAD A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO RESPOND TO THE REBELS' INCURSION. WE SHOULD BE GETTING NEWS OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S TRIUMPH RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
ISIS MILITANTS CONTROL THE BORDER AREA WITH SYRIA, THE BORDER AREA WITH JORDAN AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.
Jon: RIGHT ABOUT NOW. [LAUGHTER] WAIT! DID YOU JUST BLOW PAST EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN? DID YOU JUST YADDA, YADDA THE INVASION? YEAH, ISIS CAME IN FROM SYRIA, STARTED SWEEPING EAST, YADDA, YADDA, YADDA, THE U.N. NOW RECOGNIZES THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF ISIS. LOOK, ISIS RUNNING AN ENTIRE COUNTRY, IT SEEMS LIKE FUN, GUYS, BUT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN, RUNNING A COUNTRY IS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.
ISIS MILITANTS TRYING TO TAKE OVER A HYDRO-ELECTRIC DAM.
PROVIDING SOCIAL SERVICES LIKE FIXING POT HOLES AND INVESTING IN ELECTRICITY.
ON THE STREETS OF MOSUL, ISIS MILITANTS NOW DIRECT TRAFFIC. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. FIRST OF ALL, MY GUESS IS THAT DUDE IS NOT THE TOP JIHADI. I'M SURE THE LEADER'S LIKE, YOU, GRAB YOUR GROUP, YOU'RE GONNA MOVE DOWN TOWARDS BAGHDAD. YOU, SEIZE THE REFINERIES. JIMMY, MAKE SURE NO ONE BLOCKS THE BOX. AS YOU KNOW, FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS THE FLOW OF IRAQI TRAFFIC WAS OUR JOB. AND IF YOU THINK WE'RE JUST GOING TO SIT HERE AND LET ISLAMIST RADICALS RECALIBRATE THE "WALK", "DON'T WALK" SIGNS, WELL, LISTEN UP, MISTER, YOU GOT ANOTHER THING COMING.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS SENDING A SMALL GROUP OF AMERICAN FORCES INTO IRAQ, UP TO 275 TROOPS.
Jon: 275 TROOPS... [LAUGHTER] NOW, THERE IS AN EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF TROOPS TO FIGHT AN INVADING FORCE IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, BUT IT AIN'T 275. [LAUGHTER]
PRESIDENT OBAMA PLANS TO SEND 300 U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS TO IRAQ.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. 300 IS THE EXACT NUMBER OF TROOPS. NOT ONE LESS. NOT ONE MORE. 299 YOU LEAVE A GAP. 301 THEY'RE TRIPPING OVER EACH OTHER'S ABS. 300! WE HAVE ARRIVED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO AMERICA ONCE AGAIN BEING DRAWN INTO THE INSTABILITY OF THAT REGION, WHICH MEANS IT'S ONLY MATTER OF TIME BEFORE -- [DARTH VADER THEME MUSIC PLAYING] THERE HE IS, AMERICA'S TRAGEDY HERPE, DICK CHENEY. ALL RIGHT. DICK CHENEY, TELL US HOW WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WRONG SINCE YOU LEFT OFFICE, AND IF YOU WOULD, DO IT FROM IN FRONT OF A SEARS PORTRAIT STUDIO BACK DROP WHILST YOUR SITH APPRENTICE STANDS IN AN EERIE SILENT VIGIL. GO.
THE POLICIES OF THE LAST SIX YEARS HAVE LEFT AMERICA DIMINISHED AND WEAKENED. IRAN IS MARCHING TOWARD A NUCLEAR WEAPON. AL QAEDA IS RESURGENT, ESTABLISHING NEW SAFE HAVENS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST, INCLUDING IN IRAQ, WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA WITHDREW ALL AMERICAN FORCES WITH NO STAY-BEHIND AGREEMENT.
Jon: MY POINT IS, IF YOU SEND FEDERAL REVENUERS UP HERE, WE WILL DEFEND OUR LAND. [LAUGHTER] ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SILENT JOE? [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT, HERE'S WHAT'S UPSETTING ABOUT THIS GUY. [BLEEP] GUY ACTS LIKE WE WERE 20 SECONDS AWAY FROM TOTAL VICTORY IN IRAQ WHEN OBAMA JUST GIVES IT AWAY AT MID-FIELD AND THEN OSAMA BIN LADEN CROSSES IT AND ISIS HEADS IT HOME. GOD, HOW DID WE BLOW THAT GAME? [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, MR. CHENEY THERE, WHO WAS IT THAT NEGOTIATED WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICAN FORCES WITH NO STAY-BEHIND AGREEMENT AND, IN FACT, BRAGGED ABOUT IT IN 2009.
WE'VE NOW ENTERED INTO A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT WITH THE IRAQIS THAT CALLS FOR ULTIMATELY THE U.S. COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT AND WITHDRAWAL OF OUR FORCES FROM IRAQ, ALL OF THOSE THINGS I THINK BY ANYBODY'S STANDARD WOULD BE -- EXCUSE ME. EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS.
Jon: "SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS UNLESS SOME OTHER GUY... [CLEARING THROAT] UNLESS SOME OTHER GUY COMES IN, ABIDES BY THE AGREEMENT THAT BUSH AND I [CLEARING THROAT] NEGOTIATED. IF SOMEONE DID THAT IT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO AMERICA ROLLING OVER ON ITS BACK, SHOWING ITS BELLY AND THEN ARE YOU URINATING ON ITSELF. [CLEARING THROAT] HAS AMERICA FINALLY TIRED OF DICK CHENEY'S DISINGENUOUS BLAME GAME? PERHAPS THIS VISIT TO AMERICA'S NEWS CHANNEL WOULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER.
TIME AND TIME AGAIN HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT YOU GOT IT WRONG AS WELL, IN IRAQ, SIR. YOU SAID THERE WAS NO DOUBT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. YOU SAID WE WOULD BE GREETED AS LIBERATORS. YOU SAID THE IRAQ INSURGENCY WAS IN THE LAST THROES BACK IN 2005. WITH ALMOST A TRILLION DOLLARS SPENT THERE, WITH 4,500 AMERICAN LIVES LOST THERE, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE WHO SAY YOU WERE SO WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH AT THE EXPENSE OF SO MANY? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NO, I GUESS, WAIT... PRETTY GOOD. I GUESS NOW DICK CHENEY KNOWS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN HE SOMEONE HE THOUGHT WAS A FRIEND SHOOTS YOU IN THE FACE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] FOR MORE WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR DICK CHENEY CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL CHE. MICHAEL CHE, WHAT IS THE LATEST?
JON, THIS WEEKEND I MET WITH CHENEY TO TALK WITH HIM ABOUT HIS ROLE IN THE IRAQ WAR, THE PAST DECADE OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. AND AS I SAT ACROSS FROM HIM, BRACING FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF BLAME SHIFTING. CHENEY PAUSED. IT WAS AS IF A DECADE OF TENSION LIFTED FROM HIS FACE, LEAVING ONLY SORROW.
Jon: SORROW? WHAT?
THE DAM WAS BREAKING, JON. HE LOOKED AT ME NOT AS A POLITICIAN BUT AS ONE MAN TO ANOTHER AND SAID, "MICHAEL, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE PAIN THAT I'VE CAUSED."
Jon: DICK CHENEY SAID THAT?
YEP.
Jon: WHAT?
AND AS HE NERVOUSLY FIDDLED WITH A BUTTON ON HIS HALIBURTON PAJAMAS, HE WENT ON TO SAY, "A PLAN THAT RELIES ON UNLIMITED TROOPS AND MONEY TO STABILIZE COUNTRIES WE HAVE INVADED UNTIL THOSE COUNTRIES DEVELOP SELF-SUSTAINING PRO-WESTERN DEMOCRACY IS REALLY, REALLY STUPID."
Jon: HE SAID "STUPID"?
I'M STUPID.
Jon: HE SAID HE WAS STUPID.
END QUOTE.
Jon: SO NOT ONLY IS DICK CHENEY SO DISTRAUGHT THAT HE'S WEARING PAJAMAS IN THE DAYTIME, BUT HE IS ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS SITUATION IN IRAQ AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN INTO.
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS THAT AS RAINWATER DRIPPED DOWN THE WINDOW, DICK CHENEY PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE PANE AS HE WHISPERED, "WHAT HAVE I DONE?" [LAUGHTER] "WHAT HAVE I DONE?"
Jon: [BLEEPED]. MICHAEL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID. AND HE SAID, "I IGNORED THE REGION'S DELICATE INTERNAL POLITICS AND HID BEHIND EMPTY PROMISES THAT WE'D BE GREETED AS LIBERATORS."
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.
AND THEN CHENEY'S EMOTIONS BECAME TOO MUCH FOR MERE WORDS.
Jon: REALLY?
HE BEGAN TO SING SOFTLY IN A MELANCHOLY TONE.
Jon: WHAT?
♪ MY COUNTRY'S PISSED AT ME I LIED ABOUT WMDs ♪♪
Jon: WHAT?
IT WAS A LITTLE CLUNKY, BUT MAN, HE WAS SPITTING IT OFF THE TOP, JON. YOU GOT GIVE HIM CREDIT.
Jon: THAT IS AMAZING. MICHAEL, MICHAEL. K, CAN HE SING?
LIKE A [BLEEPED] ANGEL.
Jon: YOU GOTTA TELL ME YOU GOT THIS ON TAPE. I GOT SEE IT.
I GOT IT ON TAPE. WHAT, GET THE [BLEEPED] OUT OF HERE. MR. CHENEY,  THIS IS GOING TO MAKE GREAT TELEVISION WHEN I REPORT ALL THE WORDS YOU'RE TELLING ME RIGHT NOW. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SO IT'S ON YOU THE WHOLE TIME. LOOK, I KNOW YOU JUST STARTED WORKING HERE AND EVERYTHING, BUT THE CAMERA WAS ON YOU THE WHOLE TIME, IS THAT WHAT THAT...  YEAH...
OH, YEAH, YOU DIRECT ONE MOVIE AND NOW YOU SUPPOSED TO BE SPIELBERG?
Jon: LISTEN, IF THESE ARE CHENEY'S TRUE FEELINGS, WHY IS HE ALL OVER THE NEWS BLAMING OBAMA?
CAUSE HE'S AN ASSHOLE, JON, A TRAGIC ASSHOLE, BUT AN ASSHOLE NONETHELESS.
THANK YOU, MICHAEL. MICHAEL CHE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
