FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE ARE VERY,  VERY, VERY EXCITED. PINK IS GOING TO BE JOINING US  HERE TONIGHT TO PERFORM HER NEW  SONG. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE  PRESIDENCY. I THINK IF THERE'S ONE THING  EVERYONE CAN AGREE ON IN THE  ENTIRE COUNTRY, IT'S THAT BARACK  OBAMA IS...
THE WORST PRESIDENT WE'VE HAD  IN MY LIFETIME.
HE'S THE WORST PRESIDENT.
THE ABSOLUTE WORST PRESIDENT.
THE WORST PRESIDENT IN  HISTORY.
Jon: EXACTLY. ONYANGO OBAMA IS OBJECTIVELY THE  WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. AND THAT INCLUDES OUR 30th  PRESIDENT, CALVIN COOLIO. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHEN AMERICA HAS  DESCENDED INTO A BIT OF A  GANGSTA'S PARADISE. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, OBAMA'S PLACE AS THE  WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY  EXPLAINS WHY HE IS GETTING SO  CRUSHED.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS LEADING  MITT ROMNEY NATIONALLY BY FIVE  POINTS AMONG LIKELY VOTERS.
Jon: WITH SUPPORT. CRUSHED WITH SUPPORT. [LAUGHTER] WELL, ROMNEY'S INABILITY TO  TROUNCE HISTORY'S WORST  PRESIDENT WAS ALL SCHEDULED TO  CHANGE THIS WEEK WITH A VERY ANNOUNCED CAMPAIGN REBOOT, WHICH  AS YOU KNOW INVOLVES MR. ROMNEY  TAKING A PAPERCLIP AND PUTTING  IT INTO A HOLE. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER] BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF WHEN I  USED TO HAVE TO REBOOT REF MEN  AT THE GENIUS BAR. [LAUGHTER] UNFORTUNATELY ROMNEY'S REBOOT  WAS THROWN OFF JUST A TAD.
47% OF THE PEOPLE WILL VOTE  FOR THE PRESIDENT NO MATTER  WHAT, WHO ARE DEPENDENT UPON  GOVERNMENT, WHO BELIEVE THEY'RE VICTIMS, WHO BELIEVE THEY'RE  ENTITLED TO HEALTH CARE, TO  FOOD, TO HOUSING TO, YOU NAME  IT.
Jon: ENTITLED TO FOOD. [LAUGHTER] MEDICINE. ROOFS. THE REPUBLICAN CANDID FOR THE  PRESIDENCY SEEMINGLY  CHARACTERIZING A BROAD SWATH OF  AMERICANS THAT INCLUDE VETERAN, THE ELDERLY, THE WORKING POOR  AND MUCH OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AS  A BUNCH OF LAZY FREELOADERS. IT TOUCHED OFF A FIRESTONE  EVERYWHERE, BUT NOWHERE MORE  ACUTELY AT ROMNEY CAMPAIGN  HEADQUARTERS. [LAUGHTER] WHERE IT TRIGGERED SOMETHING I  LIKE TO CALL "CHAOS ON BULLSHIT  MOUNTAIN." [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S AN EXPLODING BULLSHIT  DUST YOU'VE ALL HEARD SO MUCH  ABOUT. IN THE 48 HOURS SINCE THE ROMNEY  VIDEO FIRST GAINED WIDE  EXPOSURE, TURD CONTAINMENT CREWS  HAVE BEEN WORKING OVERTIME ON BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN.
KEEP IN MIND IT WAS POST-ED  BY A LEFT WING WEB SITE.
"MOTHER JONES" PUT THIS TAME  OUT.
"MOTHER JONES," THE MAGAZINE  NO ONE READS.
EVEN WORD THAT JIMMY CARTER'S  GRANDSON MIGHT HAVE PLAYED AN  INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN GETTING  THIS VIDEO...
Jon: OH, MY GOD, YOUR  CAMPAIGN GOT BLOWN UP BY JIMMY  CARTER'S GRANDSON? OH, THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. [LAUGHTER] SO WORD ONE FROM BULLSHIT  MOUNTAIN IS, WELL, YEAH, HE SAID  IT, BUT YOU ONLY FOUND OUT ABOUT  IT BECAUSE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE... WE DON'T LIKE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S WORD TWO?
THE WAY HE SAID IT, IT WAS  NOT THE BEST WAY OF SAYING  SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
HE CONFUSED A LOT OF THINGS. HE MESSED UP IN THAT.
IT'S NOT THE MOST IDEAL  LANGUAGE TO BE EAVESDROPPED ON.
HE WASN'T CRITICIZING THEM. HE SAID THE AMERICAN DREAM  SHOULD BE OPEN TO EVERYBODY.
Jon: YOU'RE LOOKING AND  HEARING THE CON DESCENDING WORDS  HE WAS SAYING, NOT THE  ASPIRATIONAL, OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE HE IN RETROSPECT SHOULD HAVE  BEEN MEANING. IT'S LIKE ROMNEY JAZZ, IT'S THE  WORD YOU DON'T HEAR THAT'S  THE... SO IN INARTFUL WORDS FROM  A DUBIOUS SOURCE. [APPLAUSE] THIS IS REALLY JUST INARTFUL  WORDS FROM A DUBIOUS SOURCE. OH, AND ONE OTHER THING.
THIS IS FACTUALLY ACCURATE,  WHAT ROMNEY IS SAYING.
IF I'VE GOVERNOR ROMNEY, I  RUN WITH THIS ALL DAY LONG.
IT WAS THE TRUTH.
HE'S A BOSS THAT SAYS THE  TRUTH, BUT THE TRUTH OFTEN  HURTS. I THINK THIS WILL BE SEEN AS A  WIN FOR ROMNEY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LET ME SUM UP THE  MESSAGE FROM BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN,  IF I MAY. THIS INARTFULLY STATED DIRTY  LIBERAL SMEAR IS A TRUTHFUL  EXPRESSION OF MITT ROMNEY'S  POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND IT IS A  WINNER. [LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU  DON'T SUMMIT BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN  UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR WAY AROUND  A TURD OR TWO. THIS VERY POPULAR, DEFINITELY  EFFECTIVE WINNING POLITICAL  ARGUMENT THAT ROMNEY'S MAKING...
IT'S ANOTHERRERFECT  DISTRACTION FROM THE 14%  UNEMPLOYMENT, INSTEAD OF TALKING  ABOUT THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY, LIKE $6 TRILLION IN DEBT  AND THE MIDDLE EAST IS BURNING. INSTEAD WE'RE SITTING AROUND  GOING, DID ROMNEY INSULT THE  COUNTRY OR NOT.
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY DISCUSS  SERIOUS ISSUES TODAY ON THE  CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE THE MOVE ON THE  SECRETLY RECORDED VIDEOS.
Jon: YOU JUST WANT THE TALK  ABOUT REAL ISSUES, SO HAVE AT  IT.
A NEW RECORDING SURFACES,  THIS TIME IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA  WHO GETS CAUGHT.
IT'S PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TURN  TO BE HAUNTED BY SOMETHING HE  SAID ONCE UPON A TIME.
Jon: ARE THERE NO RULES ON  BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN? [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, I EXPECT THIS KIND OF  BEHAVIOR FROM PEOPLE LIVING AT  ASSHOLE COVE, BUT NOT... SO  RECORDED VIDEOS ARE A  DISTRACTION. HERE'S ONE FROM OBAMA. THE OBAMA VIDEO IS PERTINENT,  BUT THE ROMNEY VIDEO IS A  DISTRACTION. WHY?
IT FEATURES GOVERNOR ROMNEY  SPEAKING TO SUPPORTERS AT A  FUND-RAISER WAY BACK IN MAY.
Jon: OH, THIS VIDEO IS FROM  WAY BACK IN MAY, MAY, OH, MY  GOD, THAT WAS LIKE BEFORE JUNE. [LAUGHTER] WHO EVEN REMEMBERS MAY. GRANDFATHER, MAY I SIT ON YOUR  KNEE AND HERE YOU TELLTALE OF  WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE WAY BACK IN  MAY? [LAUGHTER] WELL, KIDDY, HOLD ON NOW. I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS  YESTERDAY. THE iPHONE 5 WAS BUT A GLIMMER  IN THE iPHONE 4S'S EYE. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TIME. NOW IN HANNITY'S DEFENSE, FOUR  MONTHS IS TYPICALLY ENOUGH TIME  FOR ROMNEY TO RADICALLY CHANGE  HIS POSITION. BY THE WAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS NEW  VERY PERTINENT VIDEO OF OBAMA  THAT FOX HAS MADE HAY OF ALL  DAY, WHEN WAS THAT VIDEO  RECORDED?
1998.
Jon: MY GOD! THAT'S MORE THAN 14 MAYS AGO. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, OBVIOUSLY BULLSHIT  MOUNTAIN HAS MANY, I GUESS YOU  WOULD SAY PEAKS AND VALLEY,  NOOKS AND CRANNIES. YOU ALL KNOW WHAT BULLSHIT LOOKS  LIKE. LOOK, WHY AM I TELLING YOU  PEOPLE. LET'S DRILL DOWN TO THE CORE OF  THIS THING.
TONIGHT IT IS ROMNEY  UNPLUGGED AS THE G.O.P. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE DELIVERS  HIS SHARPEST CRITIQUE OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THE  ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY THAT HE ENABLES ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS  BUREAU. IN 2011, 49% OF AMERICANS LIVED  IN A HOUSEHOLDS WHERE AT LEAST  ONE PERSON RECEIVED A GOVERNMENT  HANDOUT.
THIS IS THE CONSIDER OF  BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN. THE 49% ENTITLEMENT SOCIETY  OBAMA ENABLES. THAT IS THE CORE OF THE BULLSHIT  NATION FICTION THAT SOMEHOW ONLY  SINCE OBAMA, THE HALF OF  AMERICANS WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND WORK HARD AND ARE GOOD, HAVE  HAD THE FRUITS OF THEIR LABOR  SEIZED AND HANDED OVER TO THE  HALF OF THIS NATION THAT IS LAZY AND DEPENDENT AND THE OPPOSITE  OF GOOD. I'M SURE THERE'S A BETTER TERM  FOR THAT. IN THAT 49%, HANNITY IS  INCLUDING THOSE ON SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICARE, OR AS I  LIKE THE CALL THEM, HIS  AUDIENCE. DEMOGRAPHIC TV AUDIENCE SLAM. BUT PERHAPS MR. HANNITY IS  UNDERSTATING THE PROBLEM, FOR  THERE ARE MANY MORE OF THOSE TO  BE GOVERNMENT DOLE THAN EVEN HIS 49% ACCOUNTS FOR. LIKE THOSE WELFARE QUEENS AT  EXXONMOBIL, AT&T, GE, 250  CORPORATION THAT FROM 2008 TO  2010 GOT NEARLY A QUARTER TRILLION IN FEDERAL TAX  SUBSIDIES, ALTHOUGH TO BE FAIR,  AT LEAST EXXONMOBIL AND AT&T  GIVE US BACK CHEAP GAS AND RELIABLE CELL PHONE SERVICE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OR HOW ABOUT THIS, HERE'S ONE,  THE WALL STREET FIRMS WHO WERE  GIVEN ACCESS TO THE DISCOUNT  BORROWING WINDOW AT THE NERVE. OR THE $5 BILLION IN DIRECT  FEDERAL PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS  MOOCHER FARMERS, OR THE  INCREDIBLE TAX BREAKS THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THE INVESTOR  CLASS, WHOSE MONEY IS TAXED AT A  CAPITAL GAINS RATE OF 15%. AS OPPOSED TO ORDINARY HAVING A  JOB INCOME, WHICH CAN BE TAXED  UP TO 35%. BOY, I WISH WE HAD A POSTER BOY  FOR THAT ELEMENT OF THE  MOOCH-OCRACY. OH, RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] IN 2010... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IN 2010, GOVERNOR ROMNEY HAD AN  ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF $21.6  MILLION YET PAID ONLY $3 MILLION  IN FEDERAL INCOME TAX OR 13.9%. WITHOUT THE PREFERENTIAL  INVESTOR TAX CODE, ROMNEY WOUND  HAVE PAID $ 7.56 MILLION, A  GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY OF $4.5 MILLION, OR THE PUT THAT  ABSOLUTELY FAIR TAX BREAK GIVEN  TO A JOB CREATOR IN MOOCHER  CLASS DEPENDENCY TERMS, ENOUGH FOOD STAMPS TO FEED MR. ROM  THROUGH THE YEAR 4870. BY THE WAY, THAT'S NO BULLSHIT,  THAT'S THE MATH. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE  DENIZENS... [APPLAUSE] THE BIGGEST PROBLEM... THE  BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE  DENIZENS OF BULLSHIT MOUNTAIN IS  THEY ACT LIKE THEIR SHIT DON'T  STINK. IF THEY HAVE SUCCESS, THEY BUILT  IT. IF THEY FAILED, THE GOVERNMENT  RUINED IT FOR THEM. IF THEY GET A BREAK, THEY  DESERVE IT. IF YOU GET A BREAK, IT'S A  HANDOUT AND AN ENTITLEMENT. IT'S A BAFFLING, WILLFULLY  BLIND, COGNITIVE DISSIDENTS BEST  SUMMED UP BY THEIR HEAD COACH.
IN WHAT IS PERHAPS MY  FAVORITE SOUND BITE OF ALL  TIME...
I'VE BEEN ON FOOD STAMPS AND  WELFARE. ANYBODY HELP ME OUT? NO.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
