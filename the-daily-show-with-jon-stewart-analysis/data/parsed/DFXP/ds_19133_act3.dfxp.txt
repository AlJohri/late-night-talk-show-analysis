Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACTOR AND AN ACTIVIST. THE NEW DOCUMENTARY FILM ABOUT HIS LIFE IS CALLED "TO BE TAKEI."
GEORGE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. I'M PROUD OF HIM.
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.
HE'S, HE'S WONDERFUL.
WELL, IF YOU SEE HIM TALKING TO ME SOMETIMES, YOU WOULDN'T THINK SO.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT ANSWER.
HE'S ARGUMENTATIVE AND I'M DEFENSIVE.
NOTICE EVERY TIME GEORGE SAYS SOMETHING SERIOUS ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP HE ALWAYS LAUGHS IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. [LAUGHTER]
PLEASE WELCOME GEORGE TAKEI. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WELCOME.
GOOD TO BE HERE.
Jon: SO NICE TO SEE YOU. THIS, THIS DOCUMENTARY ABOUT YOUR LIFE, "TO BE TAKEI," THERE IS AN AWFUL LOT IN IT THAT IS INTERESTING AND FASCINATING. WE CAN TALK ABOUT YOUR TIME ON "STAR TREK," YOUR RELATIONSHIPS, YOUR FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS IN MARRIAGE, ALL THOSE THINGS. IF YOU DON'T MIND, THERE IS SOMETHING IN THERE THAT I THOUGHT WAS SO INTERESTING, AND THAT WAS YOUR FAMILY'S TIME IN INTERNMENT CAMPS DURING WORLD WAR II.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: I WAS STUNNED TO SEE THAT. I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT'S... YOU'RE NOT THAT UNUSUAL. THERE ARE SO MANY... [LAUGHTER] WELL, YOU ARE UNUSUAL IN ONE RESPECT.
Jon: YES. NO. I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND. I'M NOT BRAD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT UP TO ME. I DON'T CARE.
OH, I HAVE TO DO A LOT OF MAKING UP WITH HIM AFTER I DO "THE HOWARD STERN SHOW."
Jon: OH NO, I CAN IMAGINE.
BUT ON THIS SHOW... TOO FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THAT DARK CHAPTER OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: RIGHT.
WHEN AMERICAN CITIZENS OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY WERE SUMMARILY ROUNDED UP WITH NO CHARGES, NO TRIAL, NO DUE PROCESS, YOU KNOW, THE CORE PILLAR OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND PUT IN BARBWIRE PRISON CAMPS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAPPENED TO LOOK LIKE THE THE PEOPLE WHO BOMBED PEARL HARBOR. NOW, I WAS, I HAD JUST TURNED FIVE YEARS OLD. BUT I STILL REMEMBER THAT DAY WHEN MY PARENTS DRESSED MY BROTHER AND MY BABY SISTER AND ME. THEY GOT US UP VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND DRESSED US HURRIEDLY. WE WERE IN THE LIVING ROOM, MY BROTHER AND I, LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW, AND WE SAW TWO AMERICAN SOLDIERS MARCHING UP THE DRIVEWAY WITH BAYONETS ON THEIR RIFLES. THEY STOMPED UP THE FRONT PORCH, BANGED ON THE DOOR, AND MY FATHER ANSWERED IT AND WE WERE LITERALLY ORDERED OUT OF OUR HOMES AT GUNPOINT. MY PARENTS HAD LITTLE LUGGAGES FOR US TO CARRY. AND WE WENT OUT AND WE WERE STANDING IN THE DRIVEWAY WAITING FOR MY MOTHER TO COME OUT. AND WHEN SHE DID COME OUT, SHE WAS CARRYING THE BABY IN ONE ARM, A HUGE DUFFEL BAG IN THE OTHER AND TEARS WERE STREAMING DOWN HER FACE. IT'S A PICTURE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FORGET. AND WE WERE BEHIND THOSE BARBWIRE FENCES FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR. WE WERE SENT... THERE WERE TEN CAMPS ALL TOGETHER, ALL IN THE MOST DESOLATE PLACES, HELLISH PLACES. THERE WERE TWO ON THE BLISTERING HOT DESERT OF ARIZONA, IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE WERE SENT TO THE SWAMPS OF ARKANSAS. AND THERE WERE OTHERS IN THE WASTELANDS OF WYOMING, IDAHO, UTAH, COLORADO. IT WAS A DARK CHAPTER OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
Jon: COULD YOU UNDERSTAND AS A CHILD WHAT HAD HAPPENED? DID YOUR, DID YOUR FATHER, DID YOUR MOTHER, WERE THEY ABLE TO IMPART TO YOU WHAT THIS WAS? I MEAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD MAKE ANY SENSE. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOW, BUT WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS HAPPENING?
WELL, MY PARENTS TOLD US THAT WE WERE GOING FOR A LONG VACATION TO A PLACE CALLED ARKANSAS, AND THAT SOUNDED EXOTIC, ARKANSAS. [LAUGHTER] WE'D NEVER HEARD OF THAT PLACE. AND A VACATION. AND SO, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE PUT ON THESE TRAINS WITH ARMED GUARDS AT BOTH ENDS OF EACH CAR, BEING TREATED LIKE CRIMINALS, YOU KNOW.
Jon: AMERICAN CITIZENS.
INNOCENT AMERICAN CITIZENS.
Jon: RIGHT.
NO CHARGES. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT EVERYONE TOOK THEIR VACATIONS WITH GUARDS LIKE THAT. I WAS AN INNOCENT CHILD. AND, ANOTHER SCENE I REMEMBER NOW AS AN ADULT IS EVERY MORNING AT SCHOOL, AND THEY HAD SCHOOLS IN THOSE BARRACKS, WE STARTED AT SCHOOL, AND THEY HAD SCHOOLS IN THOSE BARRACKS, WE STARTED THE DAY WITH THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG. I COULD SEE THE BARBWIRE FENCE...
Jon: IN THIS CAMP.
IN THIS CAMP.
Jon: THAT THEY HAD TAKEN YOU TO. TAKEN YOU FROM YOUR HOME AND PUT YOU IN THIS CAMP.
AND THERE WAS THE AMERICAN FLAG FLYING OVER THE CAMP, BUT I COULD ALSO SEE THE BARBWIRE FENCE AND THE SENTRY TOWERS WITH THE MACHINE GUNS POINTED AT US FROM MY SCHOOLHOUSE WINDOW AS I RECITED THE WORDS "WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL," AN NNOCENT KID, RECITING WORDS THAT --
Jon: IT'S STUNNING. DID, DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR PARENTS CARRYING ANYTHING WITH THEM, LIKE ANGER OR BITTERNESS? IT'S THE TYPE OF THING I CAN'T IMAGINE EVER GETTING OVER EMOTIONALLY OR FORGIVING?
WHEN I BECAME A TEENAGER, I REALLY BECAME CURIOUS ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD INCARCERATION. AND WE HAD, MY FATHER AND I HAD LONG AFTER-DINNER CONVERSATIONS. AND WHAT I REMEMBER FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS IS THAT HE SAID, "OUR DEMOCRACY IS A PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY, AND IT CAN BE AS GREAT AS THE PEOPLE CAN BE, BUT IT'S ALSO AS FALLIBLE AS PEOPLE ARE." AND HE USED THIS EXAMPLE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD AN ATTORNEY GENERAL, A LAWYER WHO KNOWS THE CONSTITUTION, BUT HE WAS AMBITIOUS. HE WANTED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR. AND HE FOUND THAT THE SINGLE MOST POPULAR ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA WAS THE GET RID OF THE JAPS ISSUE, AND HE RAN ON IT, WON, BECAME THE GOVERNOR, WAS REELECTED AND THEN WAS REELECTED AGAIN, ONE OF THE FEW GOVERNORS TO SERVE THREE TERMS IN CALIFORNIA, AND THEN HE WAS APPOINTED TO BE THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. HIS NAME IS EARL WARREN.
Jon: WOW.
GREAT MAN BUT A FALLIBLE HUMAN BEING.
Jon:  IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY. AND I HESITATE, YOU KNOW... I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT... THERE'S TONS OF JOY AND FUN AND LAUGHTER IN THE DOCUMENTARY. IT'S GREAT.
IT'S ENTERTAINING.
Jon: I JUST PERSONALLY WAS FASCINATED BY THAT ONE ASPECT OF IT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING THAT. HE SOUNDS LIKE A REMARKABLE GUY, YOUR DAD. YOU CAN SEE "TO BE TAKEI," IT'S ON DIRECTV THROUGH AUGUST 5TH, SELECT THEATERS AND ITUNES AUGUST 22ND. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: GEORGE TAKEI, EVERYBODY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
