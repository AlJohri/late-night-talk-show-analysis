( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. THE ELECTION IS OVER! THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN, AND THE  BALANCE OF POWER IS EXACTLY THE  SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE.   ( LAUGHTER )   IS GRIDLOCK INEVITABLE OR IS  THERE A SOLUTION? AL MADRIGAL HAS MORE.
BY RE-ELECTING BARACK OBAMA  AND LEAVING CONGRESS INTACT,  VOTERS CHANGED BASICALLY  NOTHING.  IT APPEARS WE'RE FACING YEARS  OF INACTION. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT  WAY. ACCORDING TO JONATHAN MILLER OF  THE REFORM GROUP NO LABELS.
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN  WASHINGTON IS GRIDLOCK. WE HAVE DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS EACH BEHIND THEIR  OWN BUNKERS AND WE DON'T GET THE WORK DONE THAT THE CONSTITUTION  REQUIRES.
WHAT WOULD DO YOU TO BREAK  GRIDLOCK?
NO LABELS HAS A 12-POINT PLAN  CALLED MAKE CONGRESS WORK.
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME  LISTEN TO ALL 12 STEPS, RIGHT?
I WOULD LIKE FOR TO YOU  LISTEN TO ALL 12.
OKAY.
STEP ONE, IF CONGRESS DOESN'T  PASS A BUDGET, THEN THEY DON'T  GET PAID. SECOND, BE WILLING TO COMPROMISE  WITH THE OTHER SIDE. STEP THREE, WE WANT TO FIX THE  FILIBUSTER, STEP FOUR--
IS $119 A MONTH TOO MUCH FOR  A GYM MEMBERSHIP. MEMBERS TO MEMBERS TO   COME TO WORK FIVE DAYS A WEEK. STEP SIX, QUESTION TIME--
I'M SORRY. WHAT STEP WERE YOU ON?
STEP 6. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE  PRESIDENT COME DOWN TO THE WELOF  CONGRESS--
WHAT IF I WERE TO TELL BUT  THE MAGICAL LAND OF NO  GRIDLOCK.
THE LAND OF NO GRIDLOCK?
YEAH.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT HERE  IN THE UNITED STATES.
WELL, IT IS HERE IN THE  UNITED STATES. TIME FOR A CLOSER LOOK. ARIZONA. YES, AMERICA'S LARGEST GATED  COMMUNITY HAS HAD NO GRIDLOCK  FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, NONE. AND IN 2011, THEY PASSED FOUR  TIMES AS MANY LAWS AS CONGRESS. THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH  AICISM LEGISLATIVE TOOL,  ACCORDING TO STATE  REPRESENTATIVE DAVID SHAPEERA.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE ABLE TO  PASS THE BILLS THROUGH PRETTY  QUICKLY AND EASILY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SUPER MAJORITY IN BOTH  CHAMBERS.
YES, A SUPER MAJORITY. IT'S LIKE A REGULAR MAJORITY,  BUT WITH A RARE SUPER POWER IT'S  ABILITY TO TREAT OTHERS AS  INVISIBLE.  WITH TWO-THIRD OF THE STATE  HOUSE IN THEIR CONTROL,  REPUBLICANS CAN PASS PRETTY MUCH  ANYTHING.
THEY PASSED A BILL THAT SAID  THAT THE COLT 45 WOULD BE THE  STATE GUN.
EVERY STATE HAS A STATE GUN.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S 2. THERE IS A BILL THAT DEFENDS US  AGAINST SOME SORT OF LIKE U.N. INVASION.
THAT'S AWESOME.
NO, NOT REALLY.
SV1359 WOULD SAY MEDICAL  PROFESSIONAL DOESN'T HAVE TO  INFORM A WOMAN DURING HER PREGNANCY IF THE CHILD HAS A  BIRTH DEFECT.
WOW. IT'S JUST SHOWBOATING AT THIS  POINT. REALLY RUBBING IT IN YOUR  FACES.
COULD BE.
IT'S LIKE ARIZONA REPUBLICANS  HAVE ALREADY PUT THE NO LABELS  12-STEP PLAN INTO PLACE. AND THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA  COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.  THEY'RE CELEBRATING NONETHELESS  STREETS, LIKE THIS PARADE FOR  ANTI-IMMIGRATION LAW SV1070.
THE SUPER MAJORITY IS PAZZING  ALL THESE LAWS. IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED  ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
NOW, MY SPAN SIR A LITTLE BIT  RUSTY BUT WHAT HE SAID THERE IS  HE APPRECIATES THE STREAMLINED LACK OF GRIDLOCK HERE IN  ARIZONA. HE ALSO GAVE A SHOUT-OUT TO HIS  GIRLFRIEND TINA. HE'S SORRY HE HURT HER. THE OTHER GIRL MEANT NOTHING. AIRFARE TALKED TO 600 PEOPLE--
I THINK IT'S BASICALLY  ( BLEEP ).
I REALIZED, MAYBE THEY DON'T  LIKE IT. HOLD. WHAT IS THIS LAW?
IT WAS A BILL PASSED THAT  ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY  HAVE "REASONABLE SUSPICION" TO ASK SOMEONE FOR DOCUMENTATION TO  PROVE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS.
SO IF YOU'RE BROWN, THEY CAN  JUST PULL YOU OVER AND DEMAND  PAPERS?
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ( BLEEP )  ME. EXCUSE ME. HOLY ( BLEEP ). I DIDN'T REALIZE THESE LAWS  COULD AFFECT ACTUAL PEOPLE, LIKE  ME.  IF EITHER PARTY GETS A SUPER  MAJORITY IN D.C., WHO KNOWS WHAT  HELL IT COULD UNLEASH? CHICK-FIL-AS EVERYWHERE! DRUM CIRCLES! NO! ARE YOU ( BLEEP ) KIDDING ME! AAHHH! ( BLEEP ) YOU, 12 LABELS. GRIDLOCK! WE NEED YOU!
Jon:  AL MADRIGAL, WE'L
