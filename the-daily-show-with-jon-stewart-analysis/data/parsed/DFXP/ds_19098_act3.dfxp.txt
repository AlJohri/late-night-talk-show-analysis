Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT. FUNNY MAN. NEW STANDUP SPECIAL FOR COMEDY CENTRAL IS CALLED "DAVID SPADE: MY FAKE PROBLEMS."
I SAW THE 99 CENTS STORE ON THE WAY IN HERE. I ALMOST WENT IN BECAUSE MY SHOW IS NOT ON RIGHT NOW, I WAS GOING TO CHECK IT OUT. AND THEN, I HELD OUT. A MILE LATER 98 CENTS STORE,. YEAH! BRING IT HOME. BY THE WAY, NOT TO BE A SNOB, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN THOSE STORES. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT COSTS THAT MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WHAT IS THERE? THUMB TACKS AND YARN. FULL STORE, FULL. EVERYTHING. AND THE ONLY THING I THOUGHT WAS WEIRD WAS THE HOME PREGNANCY TEST.  [ LAUGHTER ] IS THIS FOR THE GIRL IN THE REGULAR PHARMACY GOING, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO FIND OUT IF I'M PREGNANT BUT I'M NOT SPENDING MORE THAN A BUCK TO FIND OUT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM DAVID SPADE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHAT IS UP?
I'VE HAD SO MUCH WORK DONE.
Jon: HOW HAVE BEEN BEEN? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GOT SOME OVER HERE.
Jon: THE PICTURE OF HEALTH. THE PICTURE OF HEALTH. WHAT IS HAPPENING?
I KNOW. YOU GOT PEOPLE ON THE SIDE, I LIKE IT. GOT IT ALL COVERED.
Jon: WHAT IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT?
I JUST PUSH THROUGH. I LIKE IT. I SAW YOUR DOG. YOU'VE GOT A NICE DOG BACK STAGE.
Jon: WHAT IS SHE? DIP?
DIP.  AND IT REMINDED ME BECAUSE MY MOM, QUICK STORY, BORING. [LAUGHTER] MY MOM HAS TWO DOGS AND SHE'S LIKE OBSESSED NOW. SHE TAKES THEM EVERYWHERE. SO, WHEN I GO BACK HOME I GO HEY MOM, WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIE? OH DAVEY, I CAN'T LEAVE THOSE DOG FOR TWO HOURS. AND I GO OH, THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID YOU USED TO LEAVE US FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY AND WENT TO WORK. NO ONE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND I'M PEOPLE. WHATEVER. IT'S A NEW AGE. THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE, JON.
Jon: NO, I UNDERSTAND. AND, AT THAT TIME YOU PROBABLY KNEW HOW TO LET YOURSELF OUT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. THE DOGS ARE A DIFFERENT STORY.
YOU STILL DO STANDUP OR YOU DO NOT?
Jon: I DO DO STAND UP. NOT AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO. I WOULD VERY MUCH -- I MISS IT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUN. IT'S LIKE A PLAY. BUT I WAS SAYING TODAY TO SOMEONE THAT IF YOU DON'T DO IT
Jon: YEAH. LIKE, I STILL DO IT. AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW I STILL DO IT. AND THAT'S WHY I WAS DOING THAT SPECIAL.
Jon: TO LET PEOPLE KNOW?
WELL, JUST BECAUSE I DO IT. AND IT'S FUN. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I JUST WANT TO LIKE HAVE IT MARKED DOWN LIKE EVEN FOR MYSELF. LIKE, THERE'S AN HOUR OF STUFF IF I NEED IT.
Jon: BUT, YOU'VE DONE THESE SPECIALS BEFORE?
I DID BUT THE HBO ONE WAS TEN YEARS AGO.
Jon: HOLY (bleep). IS THAT TRUE? IT'S WEIRD TO ME BECAUSE IT'S FRESHER IN MY MIND THAN THAT.
(bleep) MAYBE MORE.
Jon: BECAUSE I WATCH IT STILL EVERY WEEK.
I'M SURE.
Jon: SPUDLEY.
YEAH, WE DID SOME GIGS.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH WE WORKED, WE OPENED -- DAVID AND I OPENED FOR DENNIS IN ATLANTA.
DENNIS SO, FUNNY DENNIS. HE WAS GREAT. I STILL TALK TO HIM. I DID RIVIERA, DID YOU EVER DO THE RIVIERA WHEN YOU STARTED?
Jon: NO DID YOU DO THAT WITH DENNIS?
I DID, NO, DENNIS WAS TOO BIG. I DID THREE SHOWS A NIGHT. SO IT WAS 21 SHOWS A WEEK FOR $500. OH, IT WAS ROUGH. I LOVED IT. I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET THAT 500. BUT, YOU HAD TO WALK THROUGH THE CASINO ALL THE WAY IN AND IT WAS LIKE CHING CHING CHING. AND, YOU WANTED TO SPEND THE MONEY. AND, I WAS LIKE I CAN'T. I CAN'T. AND THE LAST DAY THEY GO, HERE IS YOUR MONEY OR DO YOU WANT TO BE PAID IN THESE CHIPS? FIVE DINKY LITTLE HUNDRED DOLLAR CHIPS. BECAUSE I WOULD BLOW IT ON THE WAY OUT, AND THEY KNEW IT.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I DID WHEN I WORKED AT BALLY'S. I DID A TWO WEEK GIG AT BALLY'S. BUT, THEY GAVE YOU A CHECK BEFORE HAND AND THEY ALSO GAVE YOU, WHAT THEY GAVE YOU WAS A CARD THAT LET YOU EAT IN THE CAFETERIA IN THE HOTEL. BECUASE THEY THOUGHT LIKE HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS ON THE WAY BACK UP TO HIS ROOM. TRUE TO FORM, THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, I JUST SAT DOWN THERE EATING.
OH YEAH. I ATE THERE SO MUCH THE DATES HATED IT.
Jon: YOU WOULD BRING DATES TO THE CASINO CAFETERIA?  I'D BE LIKE, YOU KNOW JIMMY THE BELLMAN. YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL DONE THERE. YEAH, YEAH. I WAS THE HELP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DO YOU REMEMBER -- SO WE WERE WORKING WITH DENNIS IN ATLANTA. YOU AND I WERE YOUNG, WE WERE VERILE AT THE TIME. HARD TO BELIEVE. SO WE WERE HEADING OUT, AND BEFORE WE WENT, YOU SAID HEY LET'S GO AND CHECK AND SEE IF DENNY WANTS TO GO. AND DENNIS WAS A HUGE HEADLINER. WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE HIM WHEN WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER. AND DO YOU REMEMBER? WE CAME DOWN INTO HIS AREA, THIS REGAL WHATEVER IT WAS, A LUXURIOUS AREA WHERE MISTING WAS OCCURRING.
YEAH.
Jon: AND, YOU SAID DENNIS, JOHNNY AND I ARE GOING TO THE CHEETAH CLUB. DO YOU WANT TO GO? AND HERE'S DENNIS MILLER JUST DID THIS, HE'S LOOKING DOWN, AND HE GOES SPUDLEY, HE LOOKS INTO THE TEA LEAFS ALL HE COMES UP WITH IS TITTY BAR.
OH, I USED TO BE INTO ALL THAT, JON.
Jon: NO, NO, NOW I KNOW OBVIOUSLY  YOU WORK WITH THE CHURCH. HOW IS THAT GOING?
I'M SORT OF EXACT SAME PERSON. IT'S SO HORRIBLE.
Jon: OH, IS THAT TRUE? NO.
PEOPLE SAY YOU SEEM LIKE YOU ARE ON TV, AND I GO I KNOW, IT'S 2% DIFFERENT. NO, I'VE REALLY GOT IT TOGETHER. LOOK AT MY TIMBER-LIZZLE HAIRCUT I GOT GOING ON.
Jon: THAT IS, THAT IS SOMEWHAT HIP.
HEY SIDE VIEW. YEAH, I'M GETTING SOME NEW HEAD SHOTS RIGHT AFTER THIS.  [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I GO, THEY COMBED IT. LET'S DO IT.
Jon: NO, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. YOU STILL HAVE, THOUGH, THAT LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM THAT I REMEMBER YOU HAVING.
DO I OR ARE YOU KIDDING?
Jon: I'M KIDDING.
I THINK I'M REALLY DOING CART WHEELS. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THIS JONBENET RAMSEY ATTITUDE. LIKE, I'M A YANKEE DOODLE DANDY. I'M NOT. I THINK IT'S MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT.
IT IS MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT. AND I LOVE IT. SO, IS THIS NOW GOING TO KICK OFF A BIG TOUR? ARE YOU GOING ON A BIG TOUR?
I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK I'M JUST GOING TO LIMP ALONG AND JUST DO IT. I DO, I MEAN, I'VE GOT THOSE 21 SHOWS NEXT WEEK AT THE RIV. I DO THE VENETIAN STILL IN VEGAS. THAT'S FUN. BUT, I LOVE STILL -- I KNOW YOU DO IT. IF YOU DO IT SOMETIMES IT'S A LOT HARDER.
Jon: OH IT'S THE WORST.
IF YOU JUST POP UP, YOU HAVE THE NOTES OUT.
Jon: OH, I KNOW. AND THEN YOU FORGET AND THE PEOPLE ARE LIKE, BUT WE PAID ACTUALLY. LIKE, OH YEAH.
YOU'RE LIKE THIS, EH. I KNOW. SPACE SHUTTLE EXPLODING.
Jon: SORRY ABOUT THAT. NO, BUT I LIKE THE IDEA THOUGH. YOU ARE DOING THE SPECIAL. YOU WANT TO GET IT OUT THERE THAT YOU ARE STILL DOING STANDUP AND THEN NOT DO STAND UP. I THINK THAT'S SMART. SMART STRATEGY. DAVID SPADE! MY FAKE PROBLEMS. COMEDY CENTRAL SUNDAY MAY 4.
