Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THE SUPREME COURT CORRESPONDENT FOR SLATE. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM DAHLIA LITHWICK. HELLO. THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. DAHLIA, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO BE... THE SUPREME COURT, THEY ALWAYS DO THIS. THEY SIT. YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING FROM THEM FOR SIX MONTHS, SEVEN MONTHS, AND THEN IN A TWO-WEEK PERIOD IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER, BLAH. [LAUGHTER] IS THAT, IS THAT PURPOSEFUL? IS THAT FOR A... WHAT IS THAT?
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT IT'S BECAUSE THESE LAST TWO WEEKS OF BLAH, DECISIONS ARE THE HARD ONES, YOU KNOW, THE ONES THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING AND THEY'RE BICKERING AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE WRITING DISSENTS OR CONCURRENCES. AND THEY'VE GOT TO SHARE AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT GO DOWN TO THE WIRE, BUT I ALWAYS SAY ANY INSTITUTION WHERE THE NINE JUSTICES POP OUT FROM BEHIND A RED CURTAIN BEFORE EACH SESSION HAS A LITTLE THEATER GOING ON.
JON: I KNOW. THEY'RE DOING, IT'S A LITTLE KABUKI. THE BLACK ROBES AND THEY WALK OUT, AND THEY DO A WHOLE THING.
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE.
Jon: THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT. I JUST WANT TO DIVE RIGHT IN. A LOT OF RELATIVELY CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS ALMOST ENTIRELY RESTRICTIVE FOR WOMEN.
RIGHT.
Jon: MEN, I THINK WE GOT THROUGH THIS SUPREME COURT TERM, I THINK QUITE WELL. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, YEAH, UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH A WOMAN. I THINK IF, YOU KNOW... [LAUGHTER] IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, YOU KNOW... SORRY... BUT... [APPLAUSE]
Jon: [CLEARS THROAT] WELL, AS A REFORMED JEW, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S NOT IN THE CARDS.
BUT, YES, TERRIBLE FOR WOMEN.
Jon: TERRIBLE. THE FIRST ONE WAS VERY SURPRISING TO ME, WHICH WAS THE BUFFER ZONE AROUND WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICS.
RIGHT.
Jon: WHERE PEOPLE MIGHT BE COMING IN FOR ABORTION SERVICES. THERE USED TO BE A WHAT WAS IT A 35-FOOT BUFFER ZONE. THEY STRUCK THIS DOWN, THE BASIS BEING, OH, IT'S AN INFRINGEMENT ON FREE SPEECH TO HAVE TO YELL.
SO THIS WAS A CASE WHERE YOU HAVE THE PERFECT PLAINTIFFS, JON, BECAUSE IT'S THESE SWEET OLD WOMEN, THEY'RE NOT EVEN PROTESTERS IN THE COURT'S VIEW, THEY'RE SIDEWALK COUNSELORS. AND THEY REALLY, AND THE COURT REALLY KIND OF STIPULATES THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT CASE IF THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO PROTESTED AS PEOPLE WENT IN.
Jon: OR YELLED THINGS.
OR YELLED THINGS. BUT THIS ISN'T THAT CASE. THIS IS PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE A CALLING TO CONVINCE WOMEN WALKING INTO CLINICS THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS WRONG. MASSACHUSETTS, IN THE WAKE OF SOME HORRIFIC SHOOTINGS IN CLINICS IN THE 1990S, SAID WE NEED A 35-FOOT BUFFER SO THAT WOMEN CAN ENTER AND EXIT SAFELY.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY, BY THE WAY, 9-0, STRIKES IT DOWN AND SAYS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY THAT THE SPEECH RIGHTS OF THESE SIDEWALK COUNSELORS REALLY TRUMP THE RIGHTS OF THESE WOMEN WHO JUST WANT TO SEEK HEALTH.
Jon: WHAT IS THE BUFFER ZONE AT THE SUPREME COURT? WHAT IS THEIR... HOW MUCH OF A... WHAT DO THEY GOT THERE? WHAT DO THEY GOT? I GUESS NOTHING?
I'VE HEARD...
Jon: THEY'VE GOT ONE?
OH, THERE'S A BUFFER.
Jon: SO WHEN THE SUPREME COURT WALKS IN BEFORE THEY OBVIOUSLY GET IN THEIR SHOW CLOTHES... [LAUGHTER] HOW CLOSE CAN THE COURT COUNSELORS BE TO THEM?
THE GENTLE SIDEWALK COURT COUNSELORS?
Jon: THE GENTLE SIDEWALK COURT COUNSELORS.
WITH THEIR POKEY SIGNS?
Jon: RIGHT.
YEAH, NO THERE'S, I'VE HEARD VARIOUSLY 100 FEET, 150 FEET, BUT THE PLAZA OUTSIDE THE COURT IS AN ABSOLUTE NO-PROTEST ZONE.
Jon: RIGHT. WHY IS THAT AND HOW DO THEY JUSTIFY THE DIFFERENCE?
WELL, SADLY FOR US, THEY DON'T MENTION IN THE OPINION...
Jon: OH REALLY?
WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTS OF ACCESS TO FOLKS THEY DISAGREE WITH AND OTHER PEOPLE DON'T. BUT I THINK IF YOU READ IT REALLY CAREFULLY UNDERNEATH IT ALL, THERE IS, BECAUSE THAT'S ME LOGIC THAT SORT OF SAYS, WHEN THE JUSTICES WANT TO ENTER AND EXIT THE BUILDING, THAT'S DIFFERENT, AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY EVEN EXPRESS AN OPINION ABOUT A WHOLE BUNCH OTHER BUFFER ZONES. WE HAVE THEM AROUND POLLING PLACES.
Jon: RIGHT.
IF YOU GO TO THE G.O.P. CONVENTION WITH A POKEY SIGN, YOU HAVE TO SIT IN A PEN, RIGHT? THE "FREE SPEECH PEN."
Jon: I REMEMBER WHEN THEY HAD THE CONVENTION HERE IN NEW YORK. WE WERE NOT ALLOWED ACCESS EVEN TO I THINK NORMAL LIKE RAY'S PIZZA PLACES THAT. LIKE, YOU HAD TO BE,  THAT ENTIRE AREA WAS "ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK." LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING YOU COULD DO THERE.
RIGHT. NO, IT'S AN AMAZING THING THAT THE COURT DOES WHERE...
Jon: BUT HOW IS THAT 9-0? AND HOW DID THAT, DID THAT COME UP IN ARGUMENT, DID ANYONE SAY WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE THAT? YOU HAVE A BUFFER.
WELL, TWO INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE ARGUMENT. ONE WAS THAT SOME OF THE JUSTICES LITERALLY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT 35 FEET LOOKED LIKE. THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THIS GOING ON. AND SO, THEY NEED TO GET OUT A LITTLE MORE. [LAUGHTER] AND THE OTHER THING WAS THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT EVEN SOME OF THE LIBERAL JUSTICES REALLY TOOK THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AS AN INFRINGEMENT ON FREE SPEECH. SO THE FACT THAT IT WAS 9-0, AND BY THE WAY, THE MAJORITY OPINION WRITTEN BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JOHN ROBERTS, TWO CONCURRENCES THAT ARE VERY ANGRY THAT WANTED TO GO FURTHER, ONE BY SAM ALITO, ONE BY ANTONIN...
JON: GO FURTHER, MEANING WHAT, YOU HAVE TO CARRY A PROTESTER ON YOUR BACK INTO THE CLINIC? LIKE WHAT? HOW? HOW? YOU HAVE TO GO OUT TO DINNER WITH THEM BEFOREHAND? LIKE WHAT? HOW DO YOU GO FURTHER?
IT'S NOT FREE SPEECH UNTIL THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND? NO, I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, "THIS TARGETS ABORTION SPEECH." NO BUBBLE, SO THERE STILL SURVIVES THIS BUBBLE, THIS FLOATING EIGHT-FOOT BUBBLE THAT THE COURT UPHELD IN A 2000 CASE. SO YOU STILL HAVE YOUR BUBBLE THAT'S EIGHT FEET, AND THEY CAN'T APPROACH THAT. AND I THINK THAT THE REASON THE LIBERALS SIGN OFF ON THIS CASE IS THEY WANT TO PRESERVE THE BUBBLE. THEY'RE AFRAID TO DO MORE. AND THE REASON THAT THE CONSERVATIVES ARE REALLY ANGRY IS THEY WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE BUBBLE. SO NO EIGHT-FOOT BUBBLE GOING FORWARD. AND I THINK WHETHER OR NOT THE EIGHT-FOOT BUBBLE, IT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT SURVIVES GOING FORWARD.
Jon: I'M JUST CONFUSED HOW COME THE BUBBLE PEOPLE GET TO SAY, YOU DON'T GET A BUBBLE. WE GET A BUBBLE, WE'RE THE BUBBLE BOYS, BUT YOU, BUBBLELESS. WILL YOU STICK AROUND, PLEASE? BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE,  WE HAVE SO MANY MORE CASES TO TALK ABOUT. WE'LL THROW A LITTLE BIT UP ON THE WEB, WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE CONTRACEPTIVE CASES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU CAN READ DAHLIA'S ARTICLES. THEY'RE WONDERFUL, VERY INSIGHTFUL. SLATE.COM. DAHLIA LITHWICK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
