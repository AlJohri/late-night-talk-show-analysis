[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO, UH, LAST WEEK ON THE SHOW, WE WERE DISCUSSING RUPERT MURDOCH'S INCREASINGLY WORRISOME ADDICTION, ADDICTION, TO PURCHASING MORE MEDIA COMPANIES. MOST RECENTLY HIS BID TO BUY TIME WARNER, IT'S SAD TO WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. AT THIS RATE HE NEEDS MEDIA SO BAD IT WON'T BE LONG UNTIL WE FIND HIM IN AN ALLEY SUCKING [BLEEPED] FOR CRACKED. THE WEBSITE, THE WEBSITE, HE WANTS TO ADD IT TO HIS MEDIA EMPIRE. [LAUGHTER] SO HE'S [BLEEPED] IN AN ALLEY FOR SOME REASON. I DON'T... HE'S ACTUALLY RICH ENOUGH, HE COULD PROBABLY BUY THAT, BUT WE ALSO MENTIONED HOW SINCE MURDOCH ALREADY CONTROLS THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL, WHICH IS SO GOOD, IF HE DID BUY TIME WARNER, HE WOULD HAVE TO PUT CNN ON THE AUCTION BLOCK, LEADING US TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP WITH OUR $10 BILLION KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN TO BUY CNN. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS: BOY THERE WAS SOME REAL ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS IDEA. WE HAVE RAISED, AND THIS IS JUST RECENTLY AS OF TONIGHT, $4.3 TRILLION. I ASSUME ALL OF IT LEGITIMATE. APPARENTLY EVERY ADULT PERSON IN AMERICA WANTS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. SO WE WANT IT TO HAPPEN, AS WELL, BUT LAST WEEK ONE OF OUR FUTURE EMPLOYEES EXPRESSED SOME DOUBT.
YOU PROGRAM HALF AN HOUR --.
Jon: 22 MINUTES.
22 MINUTES.
Jon: 22 MINUTES. BUT I DO IT FOUR DAYS A WEEK.
I'LL GIVE, I'LL GIVE YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU THE OTHER EIGHT MINUTES.
Jon: OH IT'S KILLING ME.
SO THAT'S TWO HOURS OF PROGRAMMING A WEEK, RIGHT?
Jon: RIGHT.
CNN HAS 24 HOURS TIME 7...
Jon: SURE.
168 HOURS.
Jon: 168 HOURS. THAT'S LONGER THAN JAMES FRANCO'S ARM WAS TRAPPED UNDER A BOLDER. AND HE ONLY HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT ONCE. I'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS EVERY WEEK AND I'VE ONLY GOT TWO ARMS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE CONFIDENT WE CAN DO BETTER THAN WHOEVER IS CURRENTLY RUNNING THAT NETWORK, WHICH I ASSUME IS JUST A ROOMFUL OF ANGRY CHIMPS. [LAUGHTER] LOOK, WE... THEY REALLY DON'T EVEN LOOK THAT ANGRY IN THAT PICTURE. THEY LOOK LIKE JUST SOME BEMUSED CHIMPS. TRYING TO ORDER PIZZA OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW, LOOK AT THEM. LOOK, I KNOW WE'VE GIVEN CNN A HARD TIME IN THE PAST. WE MAY HAVE LIGHTLY RIBBED THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY, THEIR MAGIC GIANT TOUCH SCREENS AND TALL, GRANDE AND OF COURSE VENTI, A NEWSROOM FLOOR YOU CAN PLAY TETRIS ON HOLOGRAM, A GIANT [BLEEPED] FOR NO REASON. FLYING PIE CHARTS, VIRTUAL IOWA CAUCUS DILDO PEOPLE. DEEP-SEA AIRPLANE SEARCH POD SIMULATORS. AND, OF COURSE, THIS.
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON TELEVISION.
HI, WOLF.
ALL RIGHT. BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. WE DID IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WE DID IT. WE MADE A REPORTER SHORTER AND BLURRIER. YOU KNOW, BUT MY POINT IS THIS: WE'VE TRIED TO BE HELPFUL, TOO. WE HAVE THE CREDENTIALS TO RUN THIS NETWORK. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE GIVEN CNN DOZENS OF NEW SHOW IDEAS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN A MINUTE WITH MORE FROM THE INCREDIBLY AWKWARD SOCIAL SITUATION ROOM.
IT'S THAT NEW SHOW, YO CNN SNAPS.
BY THE WAY, CNN'S CLOCK HAS JUST BEEN GIVE A NEW SHOW "TIME OF DAY."

HOW ABOUT A SEGMENT CALLED, HOLY [BLEEPED], THEY'RE TRYING KILL THE LADY IN THE WHEELCHAIR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NO, NO, NO, NO. DON'T. REALLY. CAN I SAY SOMETHING? WHEN YOU GO BACK IN THE ARCHIVES, IT REALLY IS OVERKILL. [LAUGHTER] LIKE WE REALLY... WHEN YOU WATCH IT BACK TO BACK TO BACK, YOU REALLY SAY TO YOURSELF, BOY, WE ARE DICKS. WE ARE. WE'VE EVEN STUFFED THE CNN SUGGESTION BOX WITH OUR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF BRILLIANT REBRANDING IDEAS WE'VE THROWN THEIR WAY. I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS THEIR NEW SLOGAN: CNN, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE [BLEEPED] WE'RE DOING. IT'S THE SOPHIE'S CHOICE OF NEWS. CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN OVER-CAFFEINATED CONTROL FREAKS. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE OF NEWS. WHICH EXPLAINS CNN'S NEW SLOGAN.
CNN, WE'RE ALL LIKE, I KNOW.
Jon: WE'RE LIKE A GHOST NETWORK. DOOMED TO ROAM THE AIRWAVES WITH NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR ALL ETERNITY. THEY'RE NOT EVEN NEWS ANCHORS ANYMORE. YOU'RE JUST NEWS V.J.s. BASICALLY CNN HAS BECOME THIS GUY. [LAUGHTER] I LOVE BRUNCH. WHO DOESN'T LOVE BRUNCH? THAT'S NEWS. IT'S GREAT BRANDING, WAY BETTER THAN CNN'S, IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS YOUR FLIGHT HAS BEEN CANCELED. PLEASE GOD, SOMEONE HELP ME FIND THE REMOTE. THE TV IS STUCK ON CNN AND I CAN'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL. C'MON MAN, SERIOUSLY, YOU CAN TELL ME. IT'S CNN. NO ONE'S WATCHING.
THIS IS CNN. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] SO HERE'S MY POINT, MOVE ON. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN STUDYING CNN? HERE'S HOW LONG:
I WENT TO THE PARTY. THEY SAID LIQUOR IN THE FRONT, BLITZER IN THE REAR. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LOOK WHAT WATCHING CNN FOR 15 YEARS DOES TO A PERSON. [LAUGHTER] THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING LABEL ON THAT NETWORK. MY POINT IS THIS: WE FEEL QUALIFIED TO TAKE THIS ON. BUT WE'RE DOING IT WITH YOUR MONEY. AND WHEN OUR PLAN SUCCEEDS, YOU WILL BE THE TRUE OWNERS OF CNN. AND SO WE'D LIKE YOUR IDEAS, AS WELL. GO TO LET'S BUY CNN.COM. GIVE US YOUR NEW CNN SLOGANS. YOUR NEW IDEAS. GIVE THEM A FULL GRAPHIC TREATMENT. PHOTOSHOP THE AMAZING TECHNOLOGY YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE NEW CNN USELESSLY INCORPORATE. LET'S BUY CNN DOT COM, YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THE EASY PART BY PLEDGING US YOUR MONEY. NOW DO THE HARD PART, PROGRAM THIS [BLEEPED] THING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
