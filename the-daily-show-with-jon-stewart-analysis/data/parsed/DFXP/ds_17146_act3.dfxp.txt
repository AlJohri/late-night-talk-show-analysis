Jon: WELCOME BACK, EVERYBODY, THE GOP IS PROMOTING THEIR BIG TENT APPROACH BECAUSE WE SAT THE  BEST [BLEEP] NEWS TEAM TO FIND OUT HOW BIG THIS TENT IS.
THIS YEAR THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TOUTED THEIR BROADER APPEAL WITH YOUTH OUTREACH  GROUPS, A WARMUP PAVILION AND EVEN COURTED MINORITIES BY LETING THE PUERTO RICANS SIT UP FRONT. SO WE WENT TO CHECK OUT THE NEW GOP. BUT THERE WAS JUST ONE PROBLEM.
HAVE WE SEEN ANY LATINOS.
NO.
EXCUSE ME, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY BLACK PEOPLE?
THAT WAY.
ARE YOU LATINO.
NO.
DAMMIT.
[BLEEP] ASIAN.
EXCUSE ME, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY BLACK PEOPLE.
OKAY, SO THIS IS PART OF-- BUT THIS JUST WHEN WE WERE ABOUT TO GIVE UP THERE  WAS FINALLY A SIGN.
ARE YOU A-- WHAT IS YOUR NAME AND ARE YOU.
LOUIS ALL VAR ADDO, I'M LATINO.
YES, FINALLY THEY APPEARED. NOW LET'S JUST TAKE TEN SECONDS, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AROUND AND COUNT HOW MANY  BLACK PEOPLE THAT WE SEE AROUND US. THEY CANNOT WORK HERE. ARE YOU READY, GO. (LAUGHTER)
I GO ZERO, HOW MANY DID YOU GET.
I GOT TWO, RIGHT BEHIND ME.
OH, THEY MAY-- ONE OF THEM HAS FRECKLES.
THIS FEELS GOOD.
AND JUST HOW WERE THEY MAKING INROADS WITH SUCH DIVERSE GROUPS, LOOK NO  FURTHER THAN THEIR YOUTH OUTREACH CAMPAIGN HEAD UP BY THEIR SUPERRAD LEADER.
WHAT'S UP, IT IS MS. J WILY HERE, PRESIDENT OF GENERATION OPPORTUNITY. HEY.
COMPLETELY.
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU ARE THE GENERATION, HOW OLD ARE YOU EXACTLY.
48 YEARS OLD.
48.
BUT I HAD A BAND WHEN I FWHAS HIGH SCHOOL.
WHAT YEAR WAS THAT, 1975.
1984 [BLEEP].
I WAS-- MINORITY-- YOUR REAL PRIZE WAS-- SO THE REPUBLICANS THE ISSUES MOST  IMPORTANT TO THEM.
I'M SORRY.
.
THERE WAS ONE PLACE RIGHT NEXT DOOR WHERE EVERYONE IS ALWAYS WELCOME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING US WITH A PLACE.
YOU'RE WELCOME HERE ANY TIME.
