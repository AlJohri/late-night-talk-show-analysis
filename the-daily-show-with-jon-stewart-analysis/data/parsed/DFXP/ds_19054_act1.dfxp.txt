FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT THE GREAT LOUIE CK WILL BE JOINING US THIS EVENING. LET'S GO. THE BIG NEWS TODAY THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS WHICH JUST FINISHED. [ LAUGHTER ] AN HOUR AGO. [ LAUGHTER ] TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW, OF COURSE, SINCE WE ALL JUST SAW IT. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ARE EAGER TO DISCUSS WHAT HAPPENED ESPECIALLY JOE BIDEN. [LAUGHTER] WHEN HE FARTED WHICH WAS SURPRISING IN NUMBER AND VOLUME. [ LAUGHTER ] APPARENTLY I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHEN THE PRESIDENT DID A WHOLE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS BECAUSE HE RELEASED THIS VINE ABOUT IT YESTERDAY.
TOMORROW NIGHT IT'S TIME RESTORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. TOMORROW NIGHT IT'S TIME TO RESTORE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL.
Jon: SO WHY EVEN GO ON WITH THE SPEECH. THAT'S ALL YOU NEED. THE REST OF THE SPEECH IS JUST JIBBITIY, JABBITY. THE STATE OF THE UNION IS BLAA. THE REST IS JUST BLAA. THE REPUBLICANS COULD GIVE THEIR AWKWARD RESPONSE SPEECH VIA VINE.
GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT'S SUCH A MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF INTRODUCING US TO ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT. THE TEA PARTY COULD HAVE THEIR TURN.
SOCIALISTS, COMMUNISTS.
TYRANNICAL.
THEY ARE COMING TO GET YOU, BARBARA.
SOCIALIST.
COMMUNIST.
TYRANNICAL.
THEY ARE COMING TO GET YOU, BARBARA.
Jon: BOOM DONE AND NOW THE MEDIA WON'T HAVE TO SPEND ALL NIGHT TRYING TO FILL AIR TIME WITH ANALYSIS.
GOOD SPEECH.
BAD SPEECH.
GREAT SPEECH.
HILLARY.
CHRISTIE.
2016.
Jon: DONE THREE HOURS OF CABLE ANALYSIS IN SIX SECONDS. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND JUST AS INSIGHTFUL. IT'S NOT LIKE THE STATE OF THE UNION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE OF LATE ANYWAY. THERE'S A STAGGERING STATISTIC FOR THE PRESIDENT GOING INTO TONIGHT'S SPEECH FROM LAST YEAR'S STATE OF THE UNION OUT OF 41 ASKS HE MADE OF CONGRESS HE GOT TWO. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE? RAISING THE DEBT CEILING AND A REAUTHORIZATION OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT.
Jon: THAT'S IT. SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT THIS CONGRESS BUT THEY WILL WHEN PUSHED RELUCTANTLY CONTINUE TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS AGAINST WOMEN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT OF COURSE THIS IS THE CONGRESS THAT WOULDN'T EVEN BAN CRAZY PEOPLE FROM GETTING ASSAULT RIFLES AFTER NEWTOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OBAMA THINKS HE'D ACCOMPLISH TALKING TO THOSE IDIOTS.
THE PRESIDENT LOOKING TO FORCE POLICY CHANGES ON HIS OWN WITHOUT CONGRESS.
Jon: I'M INTRIGUED. [ LAUGHTER ] AND INCREASINGLY WILLING TO GO AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION AND ENTERTAIN THE NOTION OF A TWO-BRANCH GOVERNMENT.
HE'S GOING TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE HIMSELF, AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE.
Jon: OF COURSE. HE WILL DO IT HIMSELF. HE DOESN'T NEED  ANYBODY. AN EXECUTIVE ORDER JUST HIM ALONE IN A ROOM. IT'S THE MOST AUTO EROTIC FORM OF GOVERNANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO NEEDS A PARTNER WHEN I HAVE MY HAND HERE. WITH A PEN IN IT. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS APPARENTLY NOW IN THE (bleep) STAGE OF HIS PRESIDENCY. [ LAUGHTER ] YEP. HE'S DONE TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE. [  APPLAUSE  ] AND NOW HE'S JUST STARTING STARTING TO TICK THINGS OFF HIS (bleep) LIST. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT BEFORE ALL THAT CAN HAPPEN -- [LAUGHTER] -- AND I'M NOT SO COMFORTABLE WITH THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER THING, WE SHOULD PROBABLY LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS MINIMUM WAGE THING. SAMANTHA BEE INVESTIGATES.
THERE'S A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION UNDERWAY IN AMERICA ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE. SOME PEOPLE LIKE FINANCIAL COMMENTATOR PETER SCHIFF THINK INCREASING IT COULD HAVE DEVASTATING EFFECTS. THERE'S A LAW IN ECONOMICS, SUPPLY AND DEMAND. IT'S SOMETHING YOU LEARN IN ECON101. AS YOU INCREASE THE PRICE OF SOMETHING YOU DECREASE THE DEMAND. WAGES THAT'S THE  PRICE OF LABOR. THE HIGHER YOU MAKE THE MINIMUM WAGE THE MORE JOBS ARE GONNA BE DESTROYED.
YOU CARE ABOUT THE POOR. OF COURSE, I DO.
I JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE TRAPPING THEM IN POVERTY.
WHY HAVE ONE JOB FOR 15 DOLLARS AN HOUR WHEN YOU COULD HAVE TWO JOBS FOR $7.50 ON HOUR.
WOULD YOU RATHER DO THAT OR PAY TWICE AS MUCH FOR YOUR BURGER?
I DO LIKE TO TASTE THE TEARS OF POVERTY IN MY MILKSHAKES. I COULDN'T WAIT TO DISCUSS THESE WITH REAL WORLD FAST FOOD WORKERS PROTESTING FOR HIGHER WAGES. IF WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE EVENTUALLY THE MARKET WILL ADJUST AND EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LOSE PURCHASING POWER.
WE CANNOT SURVIVE THE BARE MINIMUM.
IF WE COULD KEEP THIS OUT OF PERSONAL REALM. THESE FAST FOOD WORKERS LOOKING AT THINGS THROUGH THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE GOGGLES. I FOUND IT SO HARD TO EXPLAIN THE COMPLEX ECONOMIC THEORIES TO THOSE DESPERATE PEOPLE.
DID YOU EVER GO TO McDONALDS AND BURGER KING? I DON'T EAT THERE BUT THEY DON'T SEEM DESPERATE AND HUNGRY TO ME. THEY'RE YOUNG KIDS. THEY SEEM TO BE ENJOYING THEMSELVES. THE IRREPRESSIBLE TEENS WITH TEEN HIJINX.
THEY ARE JUST TEENS HAVING A GOOF. WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT? THIS IS FUN FOR YOU. YOU ARE A TEENAGER JUST MAKING SOME FUNNY MONEY TO THROW AROUND AND PARTY WITH.
I ACTUALLY HAVE FIVE SIBLINGS THAT I HAVE TO SUPPORT.
THIS IS GETTING HARDER THAN I THOUGHT. HYPOTHETICALLY, HOW WOULD YOU TELL A 48-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHO WORKS FULL-TIME IN FAST FOOD THAT HE IS NOT ENTITLED TO A LIVING WAGE.
YOU ARE CREATING A  HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
I'M 48 YEARS OLD. I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. I ONLY WORK THERE BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A JOB DUE TO THE ECONOMY.
PUTTING A FACE TO PEOPLE ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND GRAPHS IS REALLY CONFUSING. THANK GOODNESS THE ECONOMIC THEORIES ON HOW THE MINIMUM WAGE DESTROYS JOBS ARE IRON CLAD. AUTHOR AND EQUITIES ANALYST BARRY RITHOLZ.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE ECONOMY.
SHUT THE (bleep) UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
WE RAISE PEOPLE UP JUST $11 SO THEY ARE AT THE POVERTY LEVEL THEY'LL GO OUT AND SPEND THAT MONEY ON FOOD AND MEDICINE.
SURE THAT SOUNDS GOOD EXCEPT FOR ONE SIMPLE THING.
PEOPLE DON'T GO HUNGRY IN A CAPITALIST ECONOMY. IT'S SOCIALISM THAT CREATES SCARCITY. IN A FREE MARKET THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY THE POOR.
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE IN THE ECONOMY ARE NOT HUNGRY IS ALL THE PROOF YOU NEED THAT FREE MARKET CAPITALISM IS THE ANSWER.
LOTS OF PEOPLE WORKING FULL TIME FOR PROFITABLE COMPANIES LIKE WAL-MART AND McDONALDS NEED FOOD STAMPS AND WELFARE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO FEED THEIR KIDS. McDONALDS AND WAL-MART ARE THE BIGGEST WELFARE QUEENS OUT THERE.
WHAT?
THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SAFETY NET IN ORDER TO CAPTURE MORE PROFITS AND LOWER THEIR COSTS.
AS IT TURNS OUT THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY ALONE COSTS TAXPAYERS ROUGHLY $7 BILLION A YEAR IN PUBLIC ASSISTANCE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. IT'S PRACTICALLY MC WAL-MARXIST. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY IT'S OUR COUNTRY'S FOUNDING PRINCIPLES THAT MATTER. IF WE ELIMINATE THE MINIMUM WAGE LAW INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE FREE TO ACCEPT JOBS AT WHATEVER PAY THEY COULD GET.
PAINT ME A PICTURE OF A PERSON WHOSE WORK IS WORTH $2 AN HOUR.
MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO IS -- WHAT IS THE POLITCALLY CORRECT WORD FOR, YOU KNOW, MENTALLY RETARDED? WHAT IS THE NEW --
OKAY.
I BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLES THAT THE COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON.
BUT.
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT WE'RE ALL CREATED EQUAL. YOU ARE WORTH WHAT YOU ARE WORTH.
JUST LIKE OUR FOUNDING FATHERS SAID, YOU ARE WORTH WHAT YOU'RE WORTH AND WE'RE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL.
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
