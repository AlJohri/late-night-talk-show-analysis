[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM RICH CORDRAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. YOU ARE THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER BUREAU OF COMMERCE AND ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS. WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR ORGANIZATION?
IT'S THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. OUR JOB IS TO SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE TREATED FAIRLY IN THE MARKETPLACE. AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB, I THINK.
Jon: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY NOMINATED YOU. YOU WERE CREATED THROUGH THE DODD FRANK REFORM. >>RIGHT. WHEN DID THEY NOMINATE YOU?
JULY OF 2011.
Jon: WHEN DID YOU BECOME THE HEAD OF BOARD? WELL I GOT APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT AS A RECESS APPOINTMENT
IN JANUARY BUT I WAS FINALLY CONFIRMED TWO YEARS AFTER I WAS NOMINATED IN JULY OF 2013.
Jon: AND DID THAT SEND YOU THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER TO THINK THAT WAS FAST OR SLOW.
Jon: I CAN ASSURE YOU IT'S NEVER HAPPENED THAT QUICKLY BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO NOW YOU ARE DEALING WITH THESE IDIOTS. [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT HAVE YOU -- SO, YOU GET IN TO THE OFFICE. THE FIRST THING YOU DO IS WORK ON FAIR LENDING. IT'S THE IDEA THAT MORTGAGE COMPANIES, CHARTERED AND NONCHARTERED HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMER CAN AFFORD THE MORTGAGE THAT THEY ARE GIVEN, IS THAT CORRECT?
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BACK TO BASICS STUFF. THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE DEBT TRAPS PEDDLED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE LEAD UP TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. THAT THEY SHOULDN'T RUN INTO SURPRISES AND GET THE RUN AROUND WHEN THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT WE SAW A LOT OF THAT STUFF HAPPENING AND IT'S TIME FOR IT TO STOP.
Jon: WHAT HAS BEEN THE PUSHBACK ON THE REGULATIONS? HAS THERE BEEN PUSHBACK FROM THE INDUSTRY? WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESISTANCE? THERE HAS BEEN. LOOK THIS IS A BIG CHANGE IN THE STATUS QUO. SO THERE'S ALWAYS RESISTANCE. BUT THESE ARE SENSIBLE CHANGES. THIS IS REALLY TAKING MORTGAGE LENDING BACK TO WHAT CREDIT UNIONS HAVE DONE FOR DECADES. CHECKING OUT THE NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SUCCEED IN THE LOAN, NOT JUST GIVING IT TO THEM AND NOT CARING IF THEY FAIL. IF THEY GET UNDERWRITTEN OVER A TEASER RATE FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS  PRETENDING THAT'S THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE LOAN WHEN IN FACT THAT'S GOING TO FAIL
Jon: RIGHT, THAT AFTER TWO YEARS THE RATE DOUBLE AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT ANYMORE.
Jon: THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE TO THIS AND THAT IS MORE PUNITIVE. YOU ARE GOING AFTER MORTGAGE LENDERS FOR POOR BEHAVIOR. WHAT'S THAT PART OF IT?
WELL WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND WE'VE BEEN USING IT IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MARKETS. LET ME TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE CREDIT CARD MARKET. CREDIT CARDS YOU SIGN UP FOR CREDIT CARD YOU CALL TO ACTIVATE IT. OFTEN THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL YOU OTHER PRODUCTS. SOME SOUND LIKE THE KIND OF PRODUCTS YOU REALLY SHOULD GET, RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTS.  IDENTITY PROTECTION. SO YOU AGREE YOU ARE GOING TO PAY TEN DOLLARS  A MONTH. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS, MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER STEP OR TWO TO ACTUALLY GET THE PRODUCT. THEY'RE CHARGING YOU $10 A MONTH. MONTHS LATER WHEN YOU GO TO SEEK THE PROTECTION THEY SAY, OH  YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT. YOU KNOW THAT'S WRONG. THAT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK FOR CONSUMERS BACK IN THEIR POCKETS BECAUSE THEY WERE MISTREATED IN THIS WAY.
Jon: THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY IS IT ALWAYS OPERATES UNDER THE PRINCIPLE OF, ALRIGHT WELL JUST GIVE US A CUT OF IT. JUST GIVE US SOME MONEY BACK. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NO-- DOCTORS CAN LOSE THEIR MEDICAL LICENSE. LAWYERS CAN BE DISBARRED. WHEN YOU COMMIT FRAUD AS AN INDIVIDUAL, YOU GENERALLY HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU CAN'T LEAVE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY IS IT THAT WITHIN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY THOUGH ANY ENFORCEMENT IS, ALRIGHT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADMIT YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG BUT CAN WE AT LEAST HAVE -- I DON'T KNOW -- 10% OF IT? WHY CAN'T WE DO MORE?
I AGREE WITH YOU. THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR APPROACH. PART OF IT IS ABOUT GETTING MONEY BACK TO CONSUMERS WHEN  THEY WERE WRONGED. THEY SHOULD GET THEIR MONEY BACK. PART OF IT IS ABOUT IMPOSING PENALTIES WHEN THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO DETER THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR  PART OF IT IS ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM GOING FORWARD SO THEY CAN'T DO THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN BUT I ALSO THINK, COMPANIES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO ACT. THERE'S ALWAYS OFFICIALS AND PEOPLE IN THE COMPANY THAT MAKE THE DECISIONS. SO GOING AFTER THEM FOR MONEY, MAKING THEM FEEL AT RISK. SOMETIMES GOING AFTER THEM TO TAKE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS FOR A PERIOD OR REFERRING THEM CRIMINALLY IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE. THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING.
Jon: IF YOU WERE TO BEHAVE
IN A FRAUDULENT MANNER IN ANOTHER BUSINESS, YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR LICENSE TO PERFORM THAT BUSINESS. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO OCCUR. WHAT'S EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS THEY GET BAILED OUT. CONSUMERS DON'T BECAUSE OF MORAL HAZARD. CAN'T BAIL OUT A CONSUMER WHO MADE A BAD DECISION ON A LOAN BECAUSE THAT TEACHES THEM THE WRONG LESSON.
AND YET WE DON'T APPLY THE SAME THING.  YEP, MHM. THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE CRISIS AND THE WHOLE ECONOMIC SYSTEM WAS AT STAKE. I WASN'T IN WASHINGTON AT THAT TIME. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AND MY JOB -- THIS IS THE IDEA ELIZABETH WARREN HAD A FEW YEARS AGO. IT'S A GREAT IDEA. LONG OVERDUE. MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THIS AGENCY LIVES UP TO THAT PRINCIPLE.
Jon: I LIKE THAT. AND YOU'RE LIKE ELLIOT NESS, I SEE IT IN YA. I SEE THE FIRE.   I SEE YOU WITH A BASEBALL BAT WALKING AROUND THE HALLS. WILL YOU STICK AROUND? I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS. >>SURE. RICHARD CORDRAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN A LITTLE BIT.
