Jon: WELCOME BACK. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S FINALLY -- I'M SO EXCITED -- FINALLY OCTOBER. MY FAVORITE MONTH. TO BE CHARLES NELSON REILLY. IT'S HALLOWEEN SEASON, MAN! IT'S JUST LIKE -- HOLD ON. 31 DAYS OF GHOULS AND SPOOKY  STORIES. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE WHAT THE WITCH'S MONTH HAS IN STORE.
THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL SAYS IT HAS CONFIRMED THE FIRST CASE OF EBOLA HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PATIENT IS IN ISOLATION IN A HOSPITAL IN THE DALLAS, TEXAS AREA.
Jon: WE'RE GONNA GO WITH ACTUAL SCARY, HUH? ALRIGHT, GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT. HOW BIG OF A BED DO I NEED TO  HIDE UNDER?
THIS IS NOT TRANSMITTED BY  THE AIR. THERE'S NO RISK TO A PERSON IN  THIS HOSPITAL WHO'S WALKING OR  IS A PATIENT.
THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS  ONE CASE WILL LEAD TO AN  EPIDEMIC IN DALLAS OR IN TEXAS IS VERY REMOTE, CLOSE TO ZERO.
Jon: WE'RE BACK, BABY! CAN YOU HEAR THAT? THAT'S THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF DOOMSDAY BUNKERS BEING HASTILY REBRANDED AS WINE CELLARS. LOOK, THE PROBLEM IS UNDER CONTROL. COULD SOMEONE TELL THAT, THOUGH, TO THE NEWS -- CAUSE HERE'S HOW THEY STARTED THE DAY TODAY.
GOOD MORNING, AMERICA. BREAKING NEWS. EBOLA IN AMERICA. THE FIRST CASE OF THE DEADLY  DISEASE DIAGNOSEED ON U.S.  SOIL. A MAJOR AMERICAN CITY ON HIGH  ALERT.
Jon: OH YEAH! WE'RE ALL GOING TO  DIE. KISS YOUR ASS GOOD-BYE, MOTHER (BLEEP). YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLEED OUT OF YOUR (BLEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER) THEY'VE DRUNKEN SO MUCH DOOMSDAY JUICE, THEY'RE EVEN PROJECTING PANIC ONTO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PANICKING.
THIS MORNING A FRANTIC COMMUNITY SEARCHING FOR ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE COME IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE EBOLA PATIENT.
Jon: THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE  A FRANTIC CRISIS CENTER. IT'S LIKE A LOCAL ZONING BOARD  MEETING. OR THE METS PRESS ROOM ON THE  LAST DAY OF THE SEASON. THERE'S, IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE CROSSING THEIR FINGERS FOR AN OUTBREAK.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE  WILL CONTROL THIS IMPORTATION,  OR THIS CASE OF EBOLA.
Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP)? YOU DON'T GET TO JUST PUT  DRONING OMINOUS SUSPENSEFUL  MUSIC UNDER OBJECTIVELY GOOD  NEWS. THE GUY WAS SAYING, WE'VE GOT  THIS. THIS IS THE MUSIC YOU SHOULD  BE USING.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE  WILL CONTROL THIS IMPORTATION,  OR THIS CASE OF EBOLA. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: THE PROBLEM IS, THE  MEDIA WAS INFECTED BY EBOLA FEAR A LONG TIME AGO, AND NOW THAT IT'S HAD ITS TIME TO INCUBATE, THEY'RE SHOWING EXTREME SYMPTOMS. KEEP IN MIND THEY ALREADY HAVE A WEAKENED IMMUNITY TO ANY SORT OF PANIC.
A TERRIFYING WARNING ABOUT A TOY YOUR CHILD MIGHT BE WEARING RIGHT NOW, THESE BRACELETS COULD CAUSE CANCER?
A NEW TERROR THREAT COMING THAT COULD KILL MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THROUGH OUR POWER GRID.
ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND  OUT ABOUT THE PUMPKIN SPICE  LATTES, THESE INGREDIENTS ARE  LINKED TO CANCER.
Jon: EBOLA AIN'T (BLEEP) WHEN IT COMES TO PUMPKIN SPICE LATTES!  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [ APPLAUSE ]
