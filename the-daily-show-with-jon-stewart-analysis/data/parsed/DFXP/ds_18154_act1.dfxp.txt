SEPTEMBER 18, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH, WE GOT A GOOD ONE. WE GOT A GOOD ONE. WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MY MAN CRUSH... [LAUGHTER] MR. HUGH JACKMAN WILL BE JOINING US. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT, THOUGH, WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM EXCITEMENT TO NOT AS MUCH. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR SADLY RECURRING SEGMENT, DEPRESSINGLY FAMILIAR POST-TRAGEDY ANALYSIS. SO, THE GUY WHO KILLED ALL THOSE PEOPLE MONDAY WITH A SHOTGUN HE LEGALLY PURCHASED TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT, WARNING SIGNS?
ALEXIS' FAMILY HAS TOLD INVESTIGATORS HE SUFFERED FROM MENTAL ILLNESS FOR A DECADE.
Jon: A DECADE OF MENTAL ILLNESS. THAT'S PECULIAR. WOULDN'T THERE BE A PAPER TRAIL FOR TEN YEARS OF PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES.
HE SOUGHT AND RECEIVED TREATMENT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' AFFAIRS.
Jon: OH. [LAUGHTER] SO THE V.A. LOTS OF PAPER, NOT A LOT OF TRAIL. WELL, AT LEAST THE SHOOTER HAD NO LEGAL ISSUES THAT MIGHT PRECLUDE HIM FROM GUN OWNERSHIP.
TWICE HE WAS ARRESTED IN MINOR SHOOTING INCIDENTS, IN SEATTLE UNTIL 2004 AND IN TEXAS IN 2010.
Jon: YOU KNOW, IF I WANTED TO PICK OUT ONE THING THAT BEST EXEMPLIFIES OUR COUNTRY'S PECULIAR RELATIONSHIP WITH GUNS, IT MIGHT BE THAT THE PHRASE "MINOR SHOOTING INCIDENT" EXISTS. IT WAS JUST A COUPLE BULLETS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I HAD TO TURN THE TV OFF AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET UP AND GET THE REMOTE SO... WHAT EXACTLY CONSTITUTES A MINOR SHOOTING INCIDENT?
SHOOTING IN AN APARTMENT, HARASSING A COWORKER BY SHOOTING OUT HIS TIRES.
Jon: SHOOTING SOMEONE'S TIRES OUT IS NOT HARASSMENT. HARASSMENT OF A CONSTRUCTION WORKER, IS HEY, THAT'S A NICE HARD HAT, DOES IT COME IN MEN'S COLORS. THAT'S HARASSMENT.
THE TEXAS SHOOTING CASE LED TO ALEXIS' DISCHARGE FROM THE NAVY RESERVES.
.
Jon: OH, WELL THEN I GUESS THE NAVY AS PER STANDARD PROCEDURE HAD THOSE RECORDS MULCHED AND FED TO HUNGRY DOLPHINS WHERE THE RECORDS WERE POOPED ON TO THE OCEAN FLOOR. YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S ALL IN THE PAST. THAT'S THE PAST. THERE'S PROBABLY NOTHING WITHIN THE PAST MONTH THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN PAUSE TO THE SHOT GUN BACKGROUND CHECKERS.
JUST LAST MONTH THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND. ALEXIS CALLED POLICE THERE ON AUGUST 7th TO SAY HE WAS HEARING VOICES AND THAT PEOPLE WERE STALKING HIM AND USING A MICROWAVE TO SEND VIBRATIONS INTO HIS BODY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THIS IS WHY I USE A HIBACHI. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE WHEN IT TELLS ME TO KILL PEOPLE, IT SPEAKS IN A LANGUAGE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. SO IF ONLY ALL OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS HAD BEEN ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SHARE ALL THIS VERY PERTINENT INFORMATION, A REASONABLE PERSON MIGHT CONCLUDE THE SHOOTER NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HIS HANDS ON THAT SHOTGUN. UNLESS THAT REASONABLE PERSON IS FAMILIAR WITH OUR NATION'S BACKGROUND GUN CHECK LAWS.
UNDER THE GUN CONTROL ACT, THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING FIREARMS. HE WASN'T A CONVICTED FELON. HE WAS NOT AN ILLEGAL ALIEN. HE WAS NOT DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY, NOR WAS HE FOUND MENTALLY DEFECTIVE BY A COURT, SO THEREFORE HE WAS ABLE TO GO INTO A GUN STORE AND BUY A GUN.
Jon: GET IT. EVEN IF THE GUN STORE OWNER WAS AWARE THAT THIS GUY HEARD VOICES AND HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON GUN CHARGES THAT HAD GOTTEN HIM DISCHARGED FROM THE NAVY RESERVES, THAT MAN STILL WOULD HAVE PASSED A BACKGROUND CHECK WITH FLYING CRAZY. [LAUGHTER] BUT ALL OF THIS RAISES A LARGER QUESTION: WHY IS IT THAT GUNS ARE THE ONE DANGER WE SEEM UTTERLY UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IN ANY WAY?
THIS IS ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT THE FOUNDING FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION FELT SO PASSIONATELY ABOUT THAT THEY MADE SURE WAS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSTITUTION AS PART OF THE FIRST TEN AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.
Jon: CONSTITUTION. DAMMIT. WELL, I GUESS WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE OF AN ARMED-TO-THE-TEETH NATION PER OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, LIKE TERRORISM, AND EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A ROLE IN PREVENTING TERRORISM, BUT THEIR HANDS ARE TIED BY THE CONSTITUTION, LIKE WE FOUND OUT THE NSA WAS COLLECTING OUR PHONE RECORDS, AND THAT SEEMED TO US TO BE A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. WHAT DO YOU SAY, JON CORNYN?
THIS IS NOT SOMEWHERE WHERE THE PRESIDENT OR THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS RUNNING LIKE A ROGUE ELEPHANT, TRAMPLING OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES. I THINK WE OUGHT TO LOWER OUR LANGUAGE AND OUR RHETORIC A LITTLE BIT AND BE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT'S AT STAKE, AND WHAT'S AT STAKE IS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon: SO WITH GUNS THE CONSTITUTION IS IRONCLAD, BUT WITH TERRORISM IT'S A LIST OF SUGGESTIONS. [LAUGHTER] HOW ABOUT WHILE PROTECTING PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, WE BEEF UP ENFORCEMENT.
YOUR RIGHT THE BEAR ARMS SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED UPON.
Jon: WHAT ABOUT YOUR RIGHT TO WORSHIP FREELY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE?
SHOULD THE F.B.I. NOW BE ALLOWED TO GO INTO MOSQUES AND WIRETAP AND SURVEIL?
NO.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE...
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT CASE FOR OPENING UP THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING. JON: SO IF YOU BELIEVE MOHAMED IS GOD'S MESSENGER ON EARTH, AND YOU WANT TO GO TO A MOSQUE, THAT'S PROBABLE CAUSE, BUT IF YOU BELIEVE A MICROWAVE IS GOD'S MESSENGER ON EARTH AND YOU WANT TO BUY A GUN... WHEN IT COMES TO GUNS, THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WE DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
WHY SHOULD MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT BE LIMITED BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WANT EIGHT GUN?
Jon: MAYBE I'M AN OCTOPUS. [APPLAUSE] MAYBE I'M AN OCTOPUS AND I'M BEING ATTACKED BY A SQUID. YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE. DON'T JUDGE ME. [LAUGHTER] AND WHY SHOULD MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BE LIMITED BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER?
THE WAY YOU PROTECT THE HOMELAND IS YOU TRY THE FIND OUT WHAT THE ENEMY IS UP TO. I'M A VERIZON CUSTOMER. IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME ONE BIT FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT'S STOPPING TERRORISM. YOU KNOW,  IF YOU DEFINE MASS SHOOTINGS AS FOUR OR MORE PEOPLE GETTING SHOT, WE'VE HAD NEARLY 250 SO FAR THIS YEAR. WE'VE ONLY HAD 260 DAYS. OUR MASS SHOOTING AVERAGE IS 96%. OUR MASS SHOOTING SCORES SHOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH HIGHER THAN OUR PATH AND SCIENCE SCORES. THERE HAVE BEEN MORE MASS SHOOTING DAYS THAN JEWISH HOLIDAYS AND THERE ARE A [BLEEPED] LOAD OF JEWISH HOLIDAYS. I'M JUST TELLING YOU. [APPLAUSE] I THINK... MY GUESS IS IT'S PROBABLY A JEWISH HOLIDAY ABOUT HOW MANY MASS SHOOTINGS. I DON'T KNOW. WHEN IT COMES TO TERRORISM, A TERRIBLE CRIME THAT DOESN'T KILL A WHOLE LOT OF AMERICANS EVERY YEAR, WE'RE WILLING TO BARGAIN AWAY THE ENTIRE BILL OF RIGHTS. WHY IS THAT?
WE ARE IN A WAR. FIGHT THE DAMN WAR. WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH TRADITIONAL SOLDIERS WHO WEAR THE UNIFORMS OF A COUNTRY. WE'RE DEALING WITH ENEMY COMBATANTS. THE CONSTITUTION IS NOT A SUICIDE PACT.
Jon: WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT A HOMICIDE PACT EITHER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
