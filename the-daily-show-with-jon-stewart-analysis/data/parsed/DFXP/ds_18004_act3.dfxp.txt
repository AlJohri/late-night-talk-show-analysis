YEAH.
THEY ARE MORE CORY  FELDMAN BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT. DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
YOU KNEW WHO HE WAS.
I KNEW WHO HE WAS.
WHEN I SAY SOMETHING THAT  REQUIRES A FRAME OF  REFERENCE IN THE DEBATE.
Jon: WE WILL BE, I WILL  BE ON THE SAME PAGE AS YOU,  WE ARE FROM SIMILAR  GENERATIONS, I MAY BE ONE SLIGHTLY REMOVED FROM YOURS  BUT I THINK WE WILL BE IN  THE SAME FRAME OF REFERENCE. I WAS REFERRING TO YOUR  AUDIENCE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY  THE ONE THAT WON THE WAR OF  1812.
DO YOU SEE ME-- THAT-- DO  YOU SEE ME AS MITT ROMNEY IS  THAT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO  FRAME THIS NOW?
NO.
Jon: I SEE YOUS ALIKE A  WAMPA FROM STAR WARS, I SEE  YOUS ALIKE AN A BOMB ANYBODY  SNOWMAN, ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET OUT OF YOUR PERIPHERAL  VISION AND I SHOULD BE FINE.
YOU'RE GOING TO BOB AND  WEAVE.
Jon: I'M GOING SAY A  BUNCH OF STUFF AND ARE YOU  JUST GOING TO GO AAAAHH. O'REILLY ANGRY! AND THAT'S GOING TO BE IT. YOU'RE GOING DOWN. LOOK, I THINK IT'S GOING TO  BE FUN. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A  SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION. WHAT ARE THE-- DO YOU HAVE  TOPICS THAT ARE PREPARED  ALREADY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT --
YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO TALK  ABOUT MY BOOK.
Jon: NO WE'RE NOT.
RIGHT. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TALK  ABOUT YOUR INTERVIEW ON GOOD  MORNING AMERICA WHERE THEY  CALLED YOU TINY.
Jon: WHAT DID YOU THINK  OF, WHEN YOU WATCHED THE  DEBATE, AT WHAT POINT IN IT  DID YOU KNOW OH T THIS AIN'T HIS NIGHT THIS AIN'T-- THIS  AIN'T HAPPENING FOR THE  PRESIDENT. DID IT CLICK IN IMMEDIATELY.
THE ONLY THING, LOOK, I'M  JADED. I'VE SEEN THESE THINGS SINCE  1812. I HAVE SEEN, YOU KNOW,  MARTIN VAN BURREN REALLY LIT  IT UP. HE DID NOT GET THE CREDIT HE  DESERVED. THE GUY KICKED BUTT, NUMBER  8. SO WHAT I COULDN'T  UNDERSTAND, THIS IS A  SERIOUS POINT, REMEMBER THE  47% REMARK, MITT ROMNEY SAID  THAT 47% OF THE COUNTRY, SLACKERS, RIGHT.
Jon: SLACKERS.
THEY WANT STEWART'S MONEY  O RILEY'S MONEY.
Jon: CAN'T CONVINCE THEM  TO TAKE PERSONAL  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR  LIVES.
WOULD YOU THINK THAT  BARACK OBAMA WOULD BRING  THAT UP.
Jon: WITH YOU WOULD  THINK.
RIGHT, TO ENGAGE THE 47%  WHO DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED  SLACKERS BUT WHO ARE.
Jon: NOT TONE RAGE THEM,  BUT TO MOBILIZE THEM.
-- OH, I DIDN'T SEE --
SOME OF THEM ARE HERE  TONIGHT.
Jon: NO BUT HE DIDN'T --
HIS STRONGEST SUIT, WE  KEPT WAITING, OKAY, WHAT HE  IS GOING HIT HIM WITH.
Jon: DO YOU THINK WAS  STRATEGY OR DO YOU THINK, IT  WAS A KIND OF A PREVENT  DEFENSE KIND OF A THING THAT YOU THOUGHT HE WAS DOING OR  HE REALLY FELT LIKE HE JUST  DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH  THAT GUY. WILL JUST MAKE HIS CASE.
I THINK MR. OBAMA IS SO  FAR AHEAD THAT HE WANTED TO  TIGHTEN UP JUST TO BE  EXCITING. JUST TO CREATE A LITTLE BIT.
Jon: THAT'S A VERY  GENEROUS INTERPRETATION OF  THAT.
HE IS SO FAR OUT, IT'S  LIKE YOU KNOW, YOU'RE IN THE  THIRD QUARTER, UP BY FIVE  TOUCHDOWNS, JUST LET THEM CATCH UP AND THEN WE'LL BANG  THEM. YOU.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO  APPEAR IN ANY WAY GREEDY  WITH YOUR LEAD. YOU WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE  BACK. SO BASICALLY HE'S  REDISTRIBUTING HIS LEAD.
UH-HUH, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT HE DID.
Jon: VERY GOOD. I FIND THIS WHOLE THING  TOGETHER, AND GOT YOU OUT ON  TIME. KILLING KENNEDY IS ON THE  BOOK SHELVES NOW. PLEASE BUY IT BECAUSE LORD  KNOWS THIS MAN NEEDS MONEY. BILL O'REILLY.
I HAVE TO GET IT TO GIVE
