Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. AS WE'VE SEEN SEEING, A LOT OF  UNREST AND ANGER IN THE MIDDLE  EAST THIS PAST WEEK. THE CONDEMNATION OF OBAMA HAS  BEEN SWIFT AND FURIOUS
THIS LEADING FROM BEHIND  OBAMA DOCTRINE IS UP IN FLAMES
TERRORISTS BELIEVE THEY CAN  ATTACK OUR EMBASSY WITH  IMPUNITY, THEY BELIEVE KILL OUR  AMBASSADOR AND THERE WILL BE NO RESPONSE
HOW MUCH LONGER CAN WE AFFORD  TO SPILL OUR BLOOD AND TREASURE  TRYING TO, QUOTE UNQUOTE,  PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN PLACES THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY VALUES FOR  CIVILIZED SOCIETY.
Jon: YES. DEMOCRACY PROMOTION IS WRONG. THAT'S A SOMEWHAT ISOLATIONIST  POSITION, EX-GOVERNOR PALIN. DOES ANYONE SEE OUR ROLE IN THE  WORLD DIFFERENTLY? YES, YOU 2008 STILL GOVERNOR  PALIN
I SEE OUR ROLE IN THE WORLD  AS ONE OF BEING A FORCE FOR  GOOD, TO HELP THESE RISING  SMALLER DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES THAT ARE JUST, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE  PUTTING THEMSELVES ON THE MAP  RIGHT NOW
Jon: WHAT A BOLD FREEDOM  AGENDA. IT'S A LITTLE BIT NAIVE. I MEAN, THINK OF THE BLOW-BACK
EGYPTIANS ELECTED A MUSLIM  BROTHEREDHOOD MEMBER TO HEAD  THEIR COUNTRY. LET'S NOT FORGET. THIS IS VERY FIRST PLACE IN THE  MIDDLE EAST THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA  PROMISED TO BRING, QUOTE  DEMOCRACY TOO
Jon: YOU BELIEVE THROUGH THE  PRISM OF HISTORY PEOPLE WILL  LOOK BACK AT OBAMA AND THIS  SHIFT OF FREEDOM, EFFORTY AND DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND  HE'LL BE VIEWED AS MYOPIC
THROUGH THE PRISM OF HISTORY  WE'LL LOOK BACK AT GEORGE W. BUSH AND SEE THIS SHIFT TOWARD  FREEDOM, LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY  IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ELSEWHERE  IN THE WORLD AND HE WILL BE VIEWED AS A GREAT VISIONARY
Jon: FULL THROATED DEFENSE OF  THE VALUE OF DEMOCRACY
THE MEADE CORA AND OUR  GOVERNMENT, DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A GOOD THING. AND I'M SITTING HERE SAYING, ALL  RIGHT. WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE OVER? IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE MUSLIM  BROTHERHOOD WAS THE ONLY GROUP  THAT HAD ANY POLITICAL CLOUT.
Jon: YOUNG NOT AS FAT YOU. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS YOU CAN'T JUST LET  PEOPLE DEPOTS THEIR OWN  DICTATORS IN THE NAME OF  DEMOCRACY.
WE HAVE AT LEAST SOME HOPE  FOR PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND  DEMOCRACY. CERTAINLY BETTER THAN WHAT THEY  HAVE.
Jon: I GOT TO TELL YOU  SOMETHING. I LOVE IT WHEN THAT CONSERVATIVE  PATRIOT GUY PULLS ON THAT NAIVE  LEFTIST DEUTCH BAG. WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT SHOW IN  HANNITY AND TAKES THE OPPOSITE  POSITION THE YOUNGER HANNITY. IT'S A GREAT SHOW. THAT'S GREAT TELEVISION. NOW LISTEN TO ME, WE COULD GO  ALL NIGHT. WE COULD GO ALL NIGHT BRINGING  UP EXAMPLES OF PUNDITS ON THE  RIGHT WHO COULDN'T DO ENOUGH TO  PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS LONG AS IT WAS DONE AT  THE END OF GEORGE BUSH'S JAUNT. AS MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES  CHOOSE LEADERS FOR THEMSELVES  LORDY LORDY, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. WHY DON'T WE TALK THROUGH AN  ACTUAL MIDDLE EAST POLICY
AMERICANS TODAY ARE SEEING A  MESS ON THEIR TELEVISION  SCREENS. THERE'S UNLEAVING THROUGHOUT THE  MIDDLE EAST.
GOT A REAL MESS ON OUR HANDS. IN PART BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES  OF PRESIDENT OBAMA OVER THE LAST  SEVERAL YEARS IN THE REGION
Jon: THAT'S FOREIGN POLICY  ADVISOR TO MITT ROMNEY AND  MR. RYAN DAN SENOR, DECRYING THE  MIDDLE EAST MESSINESS. WHY DON'T YOU REBUT HIM, CHIEF  SPOKESMAN FOR THE COALITION  PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY IN IRAQ, A  MORE JUNIOR DAN SENOR
DEMOCRACY WE OFTEN SAID WHEN  WE WERE THERE THAT DEMOCRACY IS  MESSY. IF YOU WANT CLEAN AND TIDY  THERE'S DICTATORSHIP BUT RIGHT  NOW THESE IRAQIS POLITICAL  LEADERS ARE IMMERSED IN THEIR FIRST SORT OF DEMOCRATIC  EXPERIMENT
Jon: I GET YOU, MAN. IT WAS THE EARLY TO MID, MAN. EVERYBODY WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH  DEMOCRACY THEN. WHAT'S UP? YOU KNOW WHAT [BLEEP] I'M OUT OF  HERE. JUST GO AT IT, YOU TWO.
JUST A REMINDER OF THE CHAOS  THAT A LOT OF THE POLICIES OF  THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE SOWED. CHAOS IN THE ARAB SPRING. CHAOS FOR ALLIES IN ISRAEL. THERE ARE CERTAINLY AREAS THAT  ARE PROBLEMATIC. WE ARE HAVING SOME TOUGH DAYS. WE'LL HAVE TOUGH DAYS AHEAD. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST  THREE DAYS IS A PRODUCT OF  POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN BUILDING  OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING  SOME MODICUM DEMOCRACY, IT WILL  BE AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS. YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY  IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN A  SUCCESS. LOOKS LIKE A DISASTER TO MOST  AMERICANS. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANCE  VIOLENCE IN RECENT WEEKS. CERTAINLY TODAY'S TRAGIC DEATH  OF OVER 30 PEOPLE BUT IT ALSO  CORRELATES WITH PROGRESS ON THE  POLITICAL TRACK. DISASTER. PROGRESS. CHAOS. DISASTER. PROGRESS. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WOW. ONE MAN'S CHAOS IS ANOTHER MAN'S  PROGRESS. HERE'S THE THING THAT I REALLY  FIND THE MOST TROUBLING. HOW CAN ONE MAN'S OPINION SHIFT  SO DRASTICALLY AND YET HIS  HAIRLINE STAYS EXACTLY THE SAME? I CAN'T TELL IF THESE GUYS ARE  CYNICAL, CLUELESS OR IN DENIAL. WE WILL BE RIGHT
