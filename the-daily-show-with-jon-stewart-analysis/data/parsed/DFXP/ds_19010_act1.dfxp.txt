FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE AUTHOR MR. MALCOLM GLADWELL WILL BE JOINING US TONIGHT. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE FALLOUT OF GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND A LOOK AT THE TRUE VICTIMS. NO, NOT THE FAMILIES THAT RELY ON HEADSTART. NO, NOT CANCER PATIENTS WHOSE TREATMENT WAS DELAYED THAT'S SO -- NO! NOT THOSE FAME-WHORE PANDA CAM PANDAS. LOOK AT ME I'M NIBBLING ON BAMBOO. [ LAUGHTER ] (bleep) BUT THE REAL VICTIMS OF THE SHUTDOWN THERE WE GO.
28%. THAT'S HOW MANY VOTERS NOW SAY THEY HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT IS THE IT IS THE LOWEST SCORE EVER RECORDED FOR EITHER PARTY BY GALLUP. POLITICS IS LIKE GOLF RIGHT. THE LOWER THE SCORE THE BETTER.
WHEN YOU SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT FOR TWO WEEKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN NOTHING PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT. IT HURTS THE REPUBLICAN BRAND. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT SOME ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM SAYING THE TEA PARTY GROUPS TACTICS ARE A TAD EXTREME.
YOU CANNOT GOVERN FROM ONE PART OF ONE-HALF OF CONGRESS. THE ONLY OUT IS FOR THESE PEOPLE TO REALIZE THEY ARE IN A SUICIDE CAUCUS.
Jon: THEY ARE NOT IN A SUICIDE CAUCUS. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I FOUNDED SUICIDE CAUCUS IN 1983. THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS MY SPEED PUNK SKA JAZZ. FUSION BAND. [ LAUGHTER ]
SUICIDE CAUCUS. AND I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW THE MAGAZINE ROLLING STONE CALLED US ALSO PERFORMING. [ LAUGHTER ] I APPARENTLY HAD TO URINATE DURING THAT SET. [LAUGHTER] THAT GETS US TO THE DILEMMA THAT THE REPUBLICAN ELITE ARE FACING. THEY WANT TO LET THE TEA PARTY KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CALL THE SHOTS. THEY SURE WERE EXCITED A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN THE TEA PARTY SHOWED UP.
THE BIG SPLIT BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE NEW PEOPLE, THE TEA PARTY FOLKS IS VASTLY EXAGGERATED. I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY HARMONIOUS. I THINK OVERALL IT'S A TREMENDOUS ASSET FOR THE REPUBLICANS. IT'S THE PARTY THAT HAS A STRUCTURE ABSORBING THE ENERGY OF THESE SPONTANEOUS DEMONSTRATORS.
THEY WANTED THE ENERGY. [ LAUGHTER ]
THE REPUBLICAN -- THE PARTY WANTED TO ABSORB THE TEA PARTY ENERGY TO SWALLOW AND DIGEST THE TEA PARTY'S ENTHUSIASM AND PASSION SO LONG AS THE TEA PARTY PROMISED NOT TO BURST THROUGH THEIR CHEST AND REPLICATE -- BURST THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT'S CHEST THEY -- [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S OFBRAIN, IT'S ARCHITECT -- ELY'S BLOSSOM DEL TURDO HAS A PLAN TO FIX ALL THIS. AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW HIS PLAN INVOLVES SENDING MONEY CARE OF EL BLOSSOM DEL TURDO.
KARL HAS HELPED LAUNCH CONSERVATIVE VICTORY PROJECT THAT MADE THE TEA PARTY AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT THAT PART OF THE PARTY VERY UPSET.
OUR OBJECT IS TO AVOID HAVING STUPID CANDIDATES WHO CAN'T WIN GENERAL ELECTIONS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: OH, AND TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE FOR THE CITIZENS. NO IT'S ACTUALLY THE ELECTIONS THING. THE GOAL OF MR. ROVE'S CONSERVATIVE VICTORY PROJECT IS TO IDENTIFY CANDIDATES WITH BONA TFIDE CONSERVATIVE CREDENTIALSNA WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING FROM THE CONSERVATIVE BASE SO THEY ARE CONTROLLABLE. BECAUSE ROVE KNOWS THE CRAZY TALK IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SAID OUT LOUD.
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEEMS TO HAVE HURT ITSELF. THAT'S WHAT THE POLLS SAY. AND YOU SAY?
THAT'S ACCURATE. LOOK, WE -- REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES ANGRY OVER THE VICTORY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTED SOMEBODY TO STAND UP AND FIGHT. THE DEFUND STRATEGY WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK.
Jon: THANK YOU COMMANDER HINDSIGHT. LISTEN, BILL, I TOLD THEM IT WASN'T GOING TO WORK. I CALLED A GUY AND SAID A LONE RANGER MOVIE IN 2013. AND THEN I SAID TO STEVE JOBS, NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE PICTURES WITH THEIR PHONES, I MEAN. CANCEL THAT WHAT I SAID TO STEVE JOBS WAS SURE WISH I COULD FIT ALL MY PHONES IN MY POCKET. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE SHUTDOWN, IT'S TOO UNCOMPROMISING, FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON STOKING THE ANGER OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE OVER OBAMACARE WITHOUT AN EXIT STRATEGY. IT'S AS THOUGH THE ENTIRE MISGUIDED SHUTDOWN AFFAIR WAS A CULMINATION OF A DECADE LONG STRATEGY TO ENGAGE THE MOST RIGID AND IDEOLOGICAL POCKETS OF REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH IS WHY KARL ROVE HAS NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RADICALS RUINING HIS PARTY BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO INVITED THEM. I GIVE YOU BUILDING RED AMERICA BY TOMMY EDSALL. DURING THE 2004 ELECTION OLD CAPTAIN RETROSPECTIVELY OBVIOUS SET OUT THE G.O.P. STRATEGY OF -- QUOTE -- "ACTIVATING CONSERVATIVES ANGER POINTS RATHER THAN REACHING OUT TO MODERATES."  ANGER POINTS LIKE FREE HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. LEADING TO SCENES LIKE THIS A SENATOR FROM ROVE'S HOME STATE SHARING A STAGE AT A RALLY WITH THIS GENTLEMAN.
WE'RE RULED, QUOTE UNQUOTE, BY A PRESIDENT.
IMPERIALIST PRESIDENT.
WHO BOWS DOWN TO ALLAH. I CALL UPON ALL OF TO YOU WAGE A I SECOND AMERICAN NON VIOLENTE A REVOLUTION, TO USE DISOBEDIENCE AND DEMAND THAT THIS PRESIDENT LEAVE TOWN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TO PUT THE -- TO PUT THE KORAN DOWN, TO GET UP OFF HIS KNEES AND TO FIGURATIVELY COME UP WITH HIS HANDS OUT.
Jon: THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THAT, FACTUALLY, IDEOLOGICALLY, GRAMMATICALLY -- [LAUGHTER] -- MEANWHILE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY BEHIND HIM IS LIKE SHUT THE (bleep) UP SO WE CAN BID ON THOSE STORAGE CONTAINERS. OLD TURD BLOSSOM HERE HAS TO CREATE A SUPER PAC TO ATTEMPT TO BATTLE THE STUPID HE HIMSELF UNLEASHED SO NO SIMPATICO FOR A GUY WHO STARTED A FIRE THAT NOW RAGES OUT OF CONTROL. [  APPLAUSE  ] PERHAPS THE SINGLE LEAST SELF EXAMINING CRAZY ENABLER IS THE INCREASINGLY SENIOR SENATOR FROM ARIZONA WHO HAS THIS TO SAY ABOUT HIS COLLEAGUE'S UNCOMPROMISING SHUTDOWN STRATEGY.
WE'RE SEEING THE END OF THIS AGONIZING ODYSSEY. IT'S ONE OF THE MORE SHAMEFUL CHAPTERS I'VE SEEN IN THE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE.
SENATOR McCAIN CALLING SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES WACKO BIRDS.
Jon: YOU DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN AT ALL BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY NO MATTER HOW COOKOO FOR COCOA PUFFS YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE THEY DON'T COME CLOSE TO YOUR HATCHLING.
GOVERNOR PALIN FROM THE GREAT STATE OF ALASKA.
Jon: YOU OPENED PANDORA'S BOX. BYOU WERE THE GUY THAT GAVE THE MOGWAI A POST MIDNIGHT ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET. YOU DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN THAT THE PARTY IS OVERRUN WITH GREMLINS. WHAT'S HAPPENING? I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?
