FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART.
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. MY GUEST MIKE HUCKABEE OF THE  FOX NEWS PROGRAM HUCKABEE WILL  BE ON THE PROGRAM. HE'S CLEARLY LANDED IN THE RIGHT  PLACE FOR HIMSELF IN TERMS OF  HOSTING. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU VERY  QUICKLY, HURRICANE SANDY RELIEF  EFFORTS STILL SLOWLY BUT SURELY  ADVANCING. THE RED CROSS, FEMA COMPANIES  DOING A NICE JOB EXCEPT  OBVIOUSLY THE POWER COMPANY IN LONG ISLAND. [BLEEP]. IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF YOU LOST  POWER. BUT HERE IS THE THING ABOUT THE  CONDITIONS. IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN YOU  PROBABLY UNDERSTAND EVEN FROM  THE VIVID AND HORRIFIC NATURE OF THE IMAGES YOU'VE SEEN. THE DESTRUCTION AND DEVASTATION. THE CRAZY PART SOME OF THE  HARDEST HIT AREA ARE PLACES  HEAVILY POPULATED WITH OUR FIRST  RESPONDERS. FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE,  SANITATION, E.M.T.s, ALL LIVE  VERY HEAVILY IN THESE AREAS. PEOPLE WE RELY ON WHEN WE ARE IN  TROUBLE. THE DEDICATION OF RESCUE  WORKERS, VOLUNTEERS HAS BEEN  PHENOMENAL BUT THERE'S STILL HUGE NEEDS FOR HANDS-ON HELP OUT  THERE. WE WORK WITH A PARTICULARLY  GREAT GROUP. STATTEN ISLAND STRONG. THEY'RE BEING FUNDED BY THE  FOUNDATION THAT IS OUT IN  STATTEN ISLAND. YOU CAN DONATE. NEEDS ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING. SO THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO  HONESTLY IS SHOW UP IN PERSON  WITH A CROWBAR. OR HELP OUT AND SEND MONEY. ALTHOUGH IF YOU DO FIND YOURSELF  WITH EXTRA CROWBARS OR HEAVY  GARBAGE BAGS OR GLOVES OR MASKS OR UNDERWEAR OR SHELTER, LET  PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE, BOY, THIS  IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME. IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY TO  GET HANDS-ON WITH THIS DAMNED  THING. LET'S GET TO THE NEWS. THERE COMES A TIME IN  EVERYBODY'S LIFE WHEN YOU'RE  FACED WITH A CHOICE, WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEX AT YOUR  DESK AT WORK OR REMAIN EMPLOYED. IT CAN GO EITHER WAY.
THE DRAMATIC FALL FROM GRACE  OF ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED  MILITARY MEN OF THIS GENERATION
Jon: DON'T BE AMERICA  ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED  MILITARY MEN OF THIS GENERATION. C.I.A. DIRECTOR AND RETIRED  FOUR-STAR GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS  STEPPED DOWN FRIDAY AFTER ADMIT TO GO AN EXTRA MARITAL AFFAIR.
Jon: IT WAS CAPTAIN AMERICA. THE FOUR-STAR GENERAL AND  CURRENT C.I.A. DIRECTOR CAUGHT  IN A WEB OF SEXUAL INTRIGUE. C.I.A. DIRECTOR, PERHAPS, THIS  ISN'T A SEXY SOVIET AGENT WITH  ONE OF THEM NAUGHTY INNUENDO NAMES LIKE SONNIA VAGINOV OR  NATALIE FELLATIOVICH. AND HIS CON VAIVEING PARAMORU  TOLD ON HIM. IS THAT HOW THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT  THIS?
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MULTIPLE  U.S. OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS  THAT EMAILS BETWEEN HIM AND PAULA BROADWELL, HIS BIOGRAPHY  WERE INDICATIVE OF AN EXTRA  MARITAL AFFAIR.
Jon: REALLY? EMAIL? ALL THEY HAD TO DO TO NAB  AMERICA'S SPY-MASTER GENERAL IS  LOG TO HIS EMAIL? WE CAN INTRIGUE THAT LITTLE  SOUND BITE UP A LITTLE BIT?
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MULTIPLE  U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS  THAT EMAILS BETWEEN HIM AND PAULA BROADWELL HIS BIOGRAPHER  WERE INDICATIVE OF AN EXTRA  MARITAL AFFAIR.
Jon: HOW EXCITING. WAIT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THE WOMAN INVOLVED IS PETRAEUS'  BIOGRAPHER PAULA BROADWELL. WHY DOES THAT NAME SEEM SO  FAMILIAR TO ME? PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  PAULA BROADWELL. NO, NO, THAT'S NOT IT. OH, WAIT. THAT IS IT. BY THE WAY, IN CASE ANYONE OUT  THERE THOUGHT I MAY HAVE ACTUAL  JOURNALIST INSTINCTS, I GIVE YOU A QUICK SNIPPET OF MY INTERVIEW.
HE'S A VERY HIGH-ENERGY  PERSON. HE LOVES SERVING. HE LOVES TO BE IN THE ARENA
I THOUGHT I WOULD TEST HIM  BUT HE WOULD TEST ME.
CRUSHED HIS PELVIS. IT WAS BACK IN THE SWIMMING  POOL. FROM A MENTORING POINT OF VIEW  WANTED TO HELP ME WITH THIS  PROJECT. HE CAN TURN WATER INTO BOTTLED  WATER
Jon: THE WHOLE THING WAS  INNUENDO AFTER INNUENDO. THE WHOLE TIME I'M LIKE DUH. I HAD HER RIGHT THERE TALKING  ABOUT PETRAEUS AND IT NEVER  CROSSED MY MIND. THE WHOLE TIME. I WAS JUST STARING AT HOW  DEFINED HER ARMS WERE AND TRYING  TO THINK OF ANOTHER VERSION OF MY CLASSIC I'M AN ASTHMATIC  JOKE. I'M THE WORST JOURNALIST IN THE  WORLD. FOR GOD'S SAKES, THE TITLE OF  HER BOOK WAS "ALL IN."  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CALLED THE BOOK WHAT'S GOT TWO THUMBS AND  IS BANGING HIS BIOGRAPHY? OR AT LEAST I SHOULD HAVE  NOTICED HOW SHE WAS FOOTNOTING  HER INFORMATION. POWERFUL MAN AT THE HIGHEST  LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SUCCUMBING  TO DESIRE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO FIND  CREDIBLE PEOPLE TO SPEAK TO THIS  TYPE OF SITUATION
NEWT GINGRICH IS A FORMER  REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE AND SPEAKER OF THE  HOUSE.
Jon: WE GOT THE HIGHEST LEVEL  OF GOVERNMENT BANGING A  MISTRESS. GET ME GINGRICH. WELL BOOKED, TODAY'S SHOW. WELL BOOKED. AGE-OLD STORY. BOY MEETS GIRL. BOY MARRIES HER. BOY GETS PROMOTED. BOY BANGS UNDERLING. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS OR IS  THERE IN
THIS WAS ANNOUNCED THREE DAYS  AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WAS IT HELD?
WHEN WAS THE WHITE HOUSE  TOLD? YOU JUST HAVE TO WONDER WHAT THE  HECK IS THIS?
TO BE TOLD ON TUESDAY AT 5:00  P.M. OF ELECTION DAY WHICH IS  THE STORY NOW. FRANK HE LOO IT DOESN'T PASS THE  SMELL TEST.
Jon: IT HAS A YUCKY SMELL. CONSPIRACY NUMBER ONE. THE F.B.I. HELD BACK THE  PETRAEUS AFFAIR STORY TO PREVENT  OBAMA FROM LOSING THE ELECTION. WHY WE TRAY US' AFFAIR WOULD  HAVE HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE  ELECTION I'M NOT SURE. THE POINT IS IF ONLY A  REPUBLICAN HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS  PRIOR TO ELECTION DAY.
HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC  CANTOR SAID AN F.B.I. EMPLOYEE  TOLD HIM IN OCTOBER ABOUT THE PETRAEUS AFFAIR.
Jon: OH. THE REAL QUESTION IS, WHY IS  ERIC CANTOR PROTECTING THE  PRESIDENT? WHY? CONSPIRACY ONE DOWN. WHY WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION  WANT TO TAKE OUT PETRAEUS NOW?
THIS IS HIGHLY SUS SPUSH US  IN ITS TIMING
A FEW DAYS BEFORE PETRAEUS IS  SET TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT HE  KNEW ABOUT BENGHAZI AND WHAT THE C.I.A. DID IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING  THAT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS
THIS IS VERY SUSPICIOUS  E FACT THAT HE NO LONGER  WILL HAVE TO TESTIFY
NOW HE WON'T TESTIFY, FOLKS. Jon: RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS  ABOUT TO TESTIFY ON BENGHAZI,  CONSPIRACY NUMBER TWO, NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT PETRAEUS KNEW  UNLESS QUITTING IS DIFFERENT  FROM DYING. AND HAS NO BEARING ON WHETHER  PETRAEUS WILL HAVE TO TESTIFY.
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT NONSENSE  BECAUSE HE WILL BE SUMMONED UP  TO THE HILL. HE WILL TESTIFY.
Jon: OR WILL HE? OH, HE WILL. OF COURSE PETRAEUS HAS ALREADY  SPOKEN ONCE TO THE CONGRESS  ABOUT BENGHAZI. WE KNOW WHAT THAT IS WORTH
WHAT DID DAVID PETRAEUS DO  RIGHT AFTER WE STARTED FINDING  OUT ABOUT BENGHAZI. HE SEEMED TO SIDE WITH THE WHITE  HOUSE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT IT  WAS THE VIDEOTAPE. WHY DID DAVID PETRAEUS SIDE WITH  THE WHITE HOUSE IN THAT  TESTIMONY? HE KNEW HE WAS UNDER  INVESTIGATION FOR HIS PERSONAL  LIFE. BUT IS THERE MORE TO THIS STORY  ABOUT WHY HE SAID THAT?
Jon: CONSPIRACY NUMBER 3. EITHER THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES BLACKMAILED THE  HEAD OF THE C.I.A., FORCING HIM TO AGREE WITH THE  ADMINISTRATION'S LIE, OR THAT  THEORY IS STUPID. CAN'T BE BOTH. STILL THOUGH... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ... WHILE WE DON'T HAVE FACTS,  WHILE WE DON'T HAVE FACTS, WE DO HAVE FEELINGS
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE "WHAT  THE HECK IS GOING ON" KIND OF  MOMENTS. THIS FEELS A LITTLE HOMELAND.
Jon: REALLY LIKE THE SHOW  HOMELAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT  HOMELAND. IT'S MELROSE PLACE. HERE'S THE CONSPIRACY. A POWERFUL MAN HAD AN AFFAIR  WITH A PHONY ADMIRER. ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE SAW ANOTHER  GIRL FLIRTING WITH HIM AND SHE  WAS LIKE EMAIL WHY ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH MY MAN? BECAUSE I SAW HIM FIRST. THE OTHER GIRL IS IS I'M GOING  TO CALL MY FRIEND WHO WORKS AT  THE F.B.I. BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARING THE [BLEEP] OUT OF ME. MY GOD, THIS GOES ALL THE WAY TO  THE TOP. WELL NOT NECESSARILY THE TOP. TO THAT AREA BETWEEN THE PELVIS  AND THE UPPER THIGHS. WE'LL BE RIGHT
