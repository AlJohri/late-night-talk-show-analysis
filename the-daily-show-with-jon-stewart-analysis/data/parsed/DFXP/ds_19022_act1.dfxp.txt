FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, HE OF THE MSNBC SHOW MORNING JOE. EXCITING NEWS IN THE WORLD OF FOREIGN DIPLOMACY. THERE ARE SIGNALS THAT THE U.S. COULD BE CLOSE TO AN  AGREEMENT WITH IRAN ABOUT  ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME -- THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS BECAUSE IRAN IS JUST A WEEK AWAY FROM DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR WEAPON. THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. [LAUGHTER] SAYS PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BOMB IRAN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IF IRAN IS WILLING TO MAKE A DEAL, LET'S DO THIS --
FOREIGN MINISTERS OF BIG WESTERN POWERS LED BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY DIVERTED PLANES AND CANCELED MEETINGS TO FLY TO GENEVA.
Jon: LET THE CALL GO OUT TO THE LEAGUE OF UNKNOWN GENTLEMEN. DIPLOMATS ASSEMBLE! [LAUGHTER] THEY WERE ALL THERE, ALL THE BIG DIPLOMATS. THERE WAS HANS THE GERMAN EMISSARY JEAN CLAUDE FROM FRANCE, LORD BARRINGTON J. POWDER OF THE UK AND THE MAN FROM TEHRAN, JIMMY DEATH TO AMERICA ZARIF. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD FOREIGN MINISTERS CAME TO GENEVA BY JET, BY BOAT AND TRAIN. JOHN KERRY HIMSELF TURNED AROUND HIS TRUSTY SAILBOARD AND SAID, ATREYU -- OBVIOUSLY IT TOOK KERRY THE LONGEST TIME TO GET THERE BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE WATER. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT BECAUSE BEAR IN MIND THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THESE TALKS WE NOW TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULD TALK TO IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER BUT THAT HADN'T HAPPENED IN 34 YEARS UNTIL LAST SEPTEMBER AND THEY SPENT MORE TIME IN THE LAST 24 HOURS THAN THEY HAVE IN 34 YEARS.
Jon: 34 YEARS. 34 YEARS. I'M GUESSING AMERICA WAS LIKE, MAN, WHAT WERE WE EVEN FIGHTING ABOUT? AND IRAN WAS ALL LIKE, WELL IN 1953 YOU ORGANIZED A COUP AND OVERTHREW OUR GOVERNMENT AND INSTALLED AN AUTOCRATICT AND LEADER TO ENSURE PRO WESTERN OIL CONTRACTS WHICH  LED TO THE 1979 REVOLUTION AT WHICH POINT WE TOOK YOUR PEOPLE HOSTAGE AND AMERICA LIKE WAS RIGHT, I CAN'T REMEMBER EITHER. IF YOU REMEMBER IN THE 50s, YOU WEREN'T THERE MAN! [LAUGHTER] THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE EXCITEMENT, THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY LEANING ON THIS MOMENT THE TRIUMPHANT CLIMAX OF A THEDECADES LONG DRAMA FINALLY COMING TO FRUITION, WHAT THE (bleep). YOU'LL END DECADES OF HOSTILITY IN A CONFERENCE ROOM IN A BEST WESTERN? WHAT IS THIS? [LAUGHTER] DID THE TIME SHARE SALES GROUP GET THE ROOSEVELT SUITE OR DO YOU BLOW THE WHOLE BUDGET ON THAT JON STEWART IMPERSONATOR. [ LAUGHTER ] [LAUGHTER] STOP STEALING MY LIFE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU HANDSOME DOG. OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE THE AUDIO OF WHAT KERRY SAID TO ZARIF. I'M A PRETTY GOOD LIP READER. JUST GOING TO -- THAT IS JOHN KERRY AND HE IS GOING, YOU, I'LL POINT AT YOU AND THEN THEY GO TO HIM AND HE'S LIKE AHHHHH. I'M LAUGHING BECAUSE HE POINTED. [LAUGHTER] WE REALLY GOTTA GET THE AUDIO FOR THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY IS IN A GOOD MOOD. THIS LOOKS LIKE THE REAL DEAL, MAN, A DONE DEAL.
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE DEAL COULD NOT BE STRUCK. SECRETARY KERRY LEFT GENEVA EMPTY HANDED.
Jon: I GUESS ZARIF DON'T LIKE IT. ROCK THE TREATY. ROCK THE TREATY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M SURE KERRY DIDN'T LEAVE EMPTY HANDED IF HIS INSTAGRAM IS ANY INDICATION. YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] MOTHER (bleep) LOVES SOME MINI BAR! [LAUGHTER] WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DEAL? WHAT HAPPENED?
SECRETARY KERRY SAYS AN INTERIM DEAL ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE BUT IN THE END THE IRANIANS WALKED AWAY.
Jon: IRANIANS WALKED AWAY. SON OF A BITCH.
THAT DIDN'T SET WELL WITH THE IRANIAN COUNTERPART WHO FIRED BACK A DIFFERENT VERSION OF EVENTS.
Jon: RUTHROH?
HE POINTED THE FINGER FIRMLY AT THE WEST. MR. SECRETARY WAS IT IRAN THAT GUTTED OVER HALF OF U.S. DRAFT AND PUBLICLY COMMENTED AGAINST IT FRIDAY MORNING.
Jon: HE TWEETED? [LAUGHTER] WE HAVEN'T TALKED FOR 34 YEARS, WE GET TOGETHER AND YOU TWEET A BREAK UP. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO? TAKES A LOT OF BALLS. THAT TAKES A LOT OF BALLS. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T THE TWEETING TAKE THE GRAVITAS OUT OF IT, BY THE WAY? YOU KNOW, THE LAMPS ARE GOING OUT ALL OVER EUROPE, WE SHALL NOT SEE THEM LIT AGAIN IN OUR LIFETIMES, HE TWEETED. [LAUGHTER] HASHTAG PERSERVERE. FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO SAMANTHA BEE. SAM, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SAM, HOW IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TAKING THIS DIPLOMATIC SETBACK?
