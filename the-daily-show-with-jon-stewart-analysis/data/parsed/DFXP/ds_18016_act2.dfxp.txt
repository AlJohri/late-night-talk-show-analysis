-- CHEERS PLEWES. WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF  CONGRESSIONAL RACES GOING ON  ALSO AROUND THE COUNTRY, IN  FACT ONE SENATE CANDIDATE FROM INDIANA JUST GOT SOME  REALLY GOOD NEWS.
I'M SUPPORTING RICHARD  MOURDOCK FOR SENATE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE  PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS  LIKE THAT MOURDOCK JUST  SNALINGED THIS PLUMB ENDORSEMENT LAST WEEK. LET'S CHECK IN AND SEE WHAT  THIS BRASH YOUNG REPUBLICAN  IS ALL ABOUT.
I BELIEVE THAT LIFE  BEGINS AT CONCEPTION. THE ONLY EXCEPTION I HAVE  FOR, TO HAVE AN A DORTION IS  IN THAT CASE FOR THE LIFE OF  THE MOTHER. I STRUGGLED WITH IT MYSELF  FOR A LONG TIME, BUT I CAME  TO REALIZE LIFE IS THAT GIFT  FROM GOD AND I THINK EVEN WHEN LIFE BEGINS IN THAT  HORRIBLE SITUATION OF RAPE  THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT  GOD INTENDED TO HAPPEN.
Jon: WELL THAT BRINGS US  TO YET ANOTHER INSTALL AM OF  OUR SURPRISINGLY RECURRING  SERIES REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES SAID WHAT ABOUT RAPE NOW? (LAUGHTER)  NOW I AM NOT-- I AM NOT A  POLLSTER, OR A PUNDIT. BUT HERE'S HOW YOU KNOW YOUR  CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE VEERED  SLIGHTLY INTO THE WEEDS. WHEN 1 WEEK AFTER YOUR  PARTY'S LEADER ENDORSES YOUR  CANDIDACY YOU HAVE TO CALL A  PRESS CONFERENCE TO SAY  THIS.
I ABSOLUTELY ABHOR  VIOLENCE. I ABHOR ANY KIND OF SEXUAL  VIOLENCE. I ABHOR RAPE. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY  CONFIDENT AS I STAND HERE  THAT THE GOD THAT I WORSHIP  ABHORS VIOLENCE, ABHORS  SEXUAL VIOLENCE, AND ON HOUR SHALL -- ABHORS RAPE.
Jon: SO NOW THAT I'VE  CLEARED UP THAT I DO NOT  WORSHIP A RAPE LOVING  DIETY--   (LAUGHTER)  LET ME JUST REITERATE MOURDOCK 2012. WHOOO! WOW! WELL, I HOPE YOU ENJOYED  THAT ROMNEY ENDORSEMENT  WHILE IT LASTED, MOURDOCK,  BECAUSE YOU CAN BLOW THE KISS GOOD-BYE.
MR. MOURDOCK'S COMMENTS  DO NOT REFLECT GOVERNOR  ROMNEY'S VIEWS. WE DISAGREE ON THE POLICY  REGARDING EXCEPTIONS FOR  RAPE AND INCEST-- INCREST  BUT STILL SUPPORT HIM.
Jon: NOT OFTEN DO YOU  HEAR SOMEONE SAY I DISAGREE  WITH YOUR VIEWS ON RAPE AND  INCREST BUT -- -- INCEST.
I DISAGREE WITH YOUR  VIEWS ON RAPE AND INCEST BUT  NOT A DEAL BREAKER. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, IF ROMNEY WASN'T  WILLING TO THROW MOURDOCK  UNDER THE BUS THE SAME  COULDN'T BE SAID FOR YOUR FRIENDS AT MORNING JOE.
IT IS REMARKABLE WHAT  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HAVE  SAID THIS YEAR.
I KNOW.
REGARDING ABORTION,  REGARDING RAPE.
Jon: FINALLY, REPUBLICAN  ADMITS FELLOW REPUBLICANS IS  RENUG-- REPUGNANT. PLEASE, CONTINUE WITH THE  MORAL STAND YOU TAKE.
I'M A PRO-LIFE GUY. BUT THEY ARE DRIVING AWAY SO  MANY SWING VOTERS.
Jon: NO, THAT'S NOT THE  PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. NO, NO, NO. THE PROBLEM IS THE BELIEFING  OF THE THINGS, NOT THAT  HE-- THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT  HE VIOLATED THE FIRST LAW OF THE FETUS CLUB WHICH IS  DON'T TALK ABOUT FETUS CLUB,  LIKE THAT'S NOT-- BECAUSE  IT'S THE IDEA. I MEAN WHERE DOES MOURDOCK  GET HIS CRAZY FRINGE IDEAS  ABOUT RAPE AND ABORTION  ANYWAY? I DONE KNOW, MAYBE FROM MITT  ROMNEY'S RUNNING MATE, PAUL  RYAN WHO COSPONSORED A  SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE ACT SO SEVERE IT NOT ONLY COULD  OUTLAW ALL ABORTIONS BUT  ALSO COULD EFFECTIVELY BAN  IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION OR THE PLATFORM OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY-- CALLS FOR  A HUMAN LIFE AMENDMENT TO  THE CONSTITUTION. NOTHING IN THERE ABOUT  EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST,  LIFE OF THE MOTHER OR  FEELINGS OF SWING VOTERS. IN OTHER WORDS, ACCORD  TOGETHER REPUBLICAN PARTY  PLATFORM, AND THE MAN WHO  WANTS TO BE A HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM A PRESIDENCY, IF A  WOMAN WANTS TO HAVE A BABY,  IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION, SHE  CANNOT. RAPE, SHE HAS TO. NO WONDER THEY BURIED IT ON  PAGE 14, RATHER THAN THAN  SPLASHING IT ACROSS THE  COVER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
