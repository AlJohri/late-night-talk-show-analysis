[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW -- WE ALL KNOW THAT TWO GAY MEN IN A LOVING COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP POSES A THREAT TO OUR AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. WE ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT TWO GAY LADIES WERE OKAY WITH US. BUT WE FIND OUT OTHERWISE IN TONIGHT'S SPECIAL EDITION OF GAY WATCH, LESBIAN LIFECYCLE. â™ª  FIRST -- [LAUGHTER] -- WE BEGIN -- [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A STOCK PHOTO OR NOT BUT -- [LAUGHTER] FIRST, WE BEGIN WITH ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT MILESTONES IN A WOMAN'S LIFE. YOU MEET SOMEONE, IN THIS CASE ANOTHER WOMAN, YOU FALL IN LOVE AND YOU GET MARRIED AND THEN AND ONLY THEN IF YOU ARE BOTH READY?
THE JUDGE RULED THAT TWO SAN ANTONIO WOMEN MARRIED IN ANOTHER STATE CAN LEGALLY GET A DIVORCE HERE IN TEXAS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THEY DID IT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] TRUE DISDAIN REALLY DOES CONQUER ALL. CONGRATULATIONS. THE CASE COULD HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS BECAUSE THE STATE OF TEXAS DOES NOT RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND IN THIS CASE IS RECOGNIZING SAME-SEX DIVORCE.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THERE COULD BE A SLIPPERY SLOPE THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO SAME SEX TRIAL SEPARATIONS, SAME SEX LABOR DAY BARBEQUES, SAME SEX QUINCEANERAS. SAME SEX BAR MITZVAHS. IT'S A SLOPERY SLOPE. I'M JUST WONDERING THOUGH, WHY DO THEY NEED A DIVORCE IF THE STATE DOESN'T CONSIDER THEM MARRIED?
ALLISON FLOOD LESH HASN'T SEEN 14 MONTH OLD KATELYN SINCE NOVEMBER SHORTLY AFTER SHE AND HER WIFE OF THREE YEARS DECIDED TO SEPARATE.
Jon: OH RIGHT, LEGAL PROTECTION. SHE NEEDS TO GET A DIVORCE IN ORDER TO GET THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SEE HER KID. RIGHT, WELL THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.
LESH'S WIFE ASKED THE JUDGE TO TOSS THE CASE SINCE GAY MARRIAGE ISN'T LEGAL IN TEXAS BUT LATE TUESDAY THE JUDGE DENIED THAT REQUEST.
Jon: WOW, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STATE'S HOMOPHOBIC MARRIAGE LAWS JUST TO GET BACK AT YOUR EX. THAT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE A LESBIAN PULLING SUCH A DICK MOVE. THAT IS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE. NICE. ON TO THE NEXT STAGE IN THE CYCLE OF A LESBIANS LIFE. RETIREMENT, A JOYFUL REFLECTIVE TIME THOUGH LESS SO WHEN SAID RETIREMENT WAS NOT VOLUNTARY. SUCH WAS THE CASE FOR LATTA SOUTH CAROLINA POLICE CHIEF CRYSTAL MOORE WHO CLAIMS SHE WAS FIRED AFTER 23 YEARS ON THE FORCE BECAUSE OF HER SEXUAL ORIENTATION. BUT WAS SHE? WAS SHE?
SOME RESIDENTS BELIEVE THE MAYOR FIRING CRYSTAL WAS PAYBACK. CHIEF MOORE INVESTIGATED MAYOR BULLARD'S MOST RECENT HIRE. CHIEF MOORE FOUND THE MAYOR NEGLECTED TO CONDUCT A BACKGROUND CHECK ON SELLERS.
Jon: AND, IF HE HAD RUN A BECOMEGROUND CHECK THE MAYOR WOULD HAVE FUND OUT THAT VONTRAY SELLERS HAD CRASHED HIS CAR IN A DITCH WHILE DRUNK DRIVING. SO, IT IS POSSIBLE THIS ISN'T A CASE OF HOMOPHOBIA AND JUST SOME GOOD OLD FASHIONED SMALL TOWN CRONYISM.
THE CITY'S NEW MAYOR EARL BULLARD WHO WAS SECRETLY RECORDED BY A COUNCIL MEMBER.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE SOMEBODY WHO DRANK AND DRANK TOO MUCH TAKING CARE OF MY CHILD THAN I HAVE SOMEBODY WHOSE LIFESTYLE IS QUESTION ABLE AROUND CHILDREN.
Jon: OKAY HOMOPHOBIA IT WAS. ALRIGHT, I'M SORRY. NO, HE'S JUST SAYING HIS CHILD CARE HIERARCHY IS THIS.  HIS FIRST CHOICE, HIS EXWIFE, SECOND CHOICE 15-YEAR-OLD DOWN THE STREET WITH ADD. THEN DRUNK GUY, THEN ESCAPED MENTAL PATIENT, THEN TORONTO CRACK SMOKING MAYOR ROB FORD AND THEN FIGMENT OF HIS IMAGINATION AND THEN AND ONLY THEN A RESPONSIBLE LESBIAN WHO RUNS AN ACCREDITED AND LICENSED CHILD CARE FACILITY. SIR, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHY CAN'T A LESBIAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILD?
BECAUSE THAT AIN'T THE DAMN WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
Jon: SAYS IT RIGHT THERE IN THE BIBLE. GOD SAYth UNTO MOSES, THOU SHALT LEAVE THY SON TO BE WATCHED BY YE WHO DRUNKENLY ABANDONED HIS CAR IN A DITCH. SO SAYETH THE LORD. SO, LESBIANS DON'T GET TO TAKE PART IN EVERY DAY LIFE EVEN THE BAD PARTS LIKE DIVORCE AND WORK. AT LEAST TELL ME THEY ARE TREATED EQUALLY AT THE END OF THE LIFE CYCLE.
IN IDAHO, A NAVY VET IS MOURNING THE DEATH OF HER LATE WIFE BUT MADELEINE TAYLOR IS ALSO MOURNING SOMETHING ELSE. THE STATE RUN VETERANS CEMETERY WHERE TAYLOR HOPES TO BE BURIED ONE DAY IS REFUSING TO BURY HER WITH HER WIFE'S REMAINS.
Jon: YE YOU (bleep). CONGRATULATIONS IDAHO YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO SCREW GAY PEOPLE FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. AND A VETERAN NO LESS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,  THIS WOMAN BETTER NOT BE ADORABLE OR YOU ARE IN TROUBLE.
TAYLOR  WAS HOPING THEY WOULD APPROVE IT SINCE THEIR ASHES WOULD FIT IN ONE SPOT ON THE WALL.
IT'S NOT TAKING UP ANY MORE SPACE TO HAVE BOTH OF US IN THERE. I DON'T SEE WHERE THE ASHES OF OF A COUPLE OF OLD LESBIANS IS GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.
Jon: IDAHO. YOU ARE TELLING ME YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT SWEET OLD LADY, BURNED TO ASHES AND PLACED IN --  [LAUGHTER] -- POINT IS JUST LET HER DO WHAT SHE WANTS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
