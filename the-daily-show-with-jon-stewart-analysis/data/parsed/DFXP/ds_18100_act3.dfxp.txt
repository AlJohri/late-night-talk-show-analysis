Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY  GUEST ONE OF OUR FAVORITE  ITS, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED LET'S EXPLORE DIABETES WITH  OWLS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM DAVID SEDARIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: AN ABSOLUTE  PLEASURE. FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY YOU  LOOK TERRIFIC. VERY NICE SUIT, I ENJOY IT  VERY MUCH. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR BOOK. YOU ARE ALL OVER THE-- HOW  FAR YOUR BOOK TOUR IS, HOW  MANY CITIES, HOW MANY-- DO YOU EVEN KNOW ANY MORE?
I THINK IT'S LIKE 60 OR  57. BUT I STARTED, I THINK I'VE  BEEN TO LIKE 36 CITIES SO  FAR.
36 CITIES. WHICH ONE DID YOU HATE THE  MOST? ANY OF THEM?
I JUST NOTICED HOW PEOPLE  DRESS DIFFERENTLY IN -- LIKE  IN RENO, NEVADA, THE ICE BREAKING QUESTION WHEN I WAS  SIGNING BOOKS IS WHY DID YOU  CHOOSE THAT T-SHIRT. I MEAN YOU THINK THIS WAS  LIKE A LECTURE TOUR SO  PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS AND  THEY'RE GOING TO THE  THEATRE. SO YOU WOULD JUST THINK  MAYBE YOU WOULD PUT ON A  LONG PAIR OF PANTS OR A  SHORTS THAT WEREN'T CUTTOFF, MAYBE, IF YOU WERE GOING  TO-- BUYING A TICKET.
Jon: WHAT WAS THE CLIMATE  LIKE, WAS IT PARTICULARLY  HOT AND HUMID ENVIRONMENT THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WELL, I  DON'T WANT TO PERSPIRE.
I ASKED A WOMAN WEARING A  COUNT CHOCKULA T-SHIRT. AND SHE WAS IN HER 60s. AND I SAID IS THAT YOUR GOOD  COUNT CHOCKULAT-SHIRT. AND SHE SAID I DIDN'T ANYONE  WAS GOING TO NOTICE. YOU KNOW, I THINK IS THE  SAME-- YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE  GO TO THE GROCERY STORE  WEARING ANYTHING. I THINK IT'S THE SAME, YOU  KNOW, ACCEPT THEY BOUGHT A  TICKET AND THEY SPENT $50 OR $60 BUCKS. SAME THINKING. BUT THE PEOPLE ARE ALL-- I  MEAN I LIKE THEM. I MEAN I LIKE THEM ALL  PERFECTLY FINE. YOU JUST NOTICE FROM CITY TO  CITY.
Jon: WERE THERE OTHER  CITIES, ARE THERE SOME  PEOPLE THAT COME IN A TOP HAT AND TAILS, LIKE IS THERE  A MORE FORMAL.
SAN FRANCISCO I FIND  PEOPLE-- .
Jon: ARE THEY TRYING TO  HARD IN SAN FRANCISCO, DO  YOU THINK?
NO, NO, THEY-- BUT THEY  PUT A LITTLE EFFORT INTO IT. THAT'S JUST, I NOTICED.
Jon: DID YOU FIND ANYONE  CAME UP TO THE TABLE AND YOU  DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AND THEY WERE LIKE HUH. I WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS  OUTFIT, LIKE DID ANYONE COME  OUT WITH APPELLETTES OR MICHAEL JACKSON OUTFIT OR  ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
NOTHING THAT SEVERE.
Jon: I LOVE THE COUNT  CHOCULA THING BECAUSE I  DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THAT T-SHIRT, LIKE SHE MUST HAVE  GOTTEN IT WHEN SHE WAS 20.
SHE WAS IN HER MID 60s  AND HAD A COUNT CHOCULA  T-SHIRT ON IT. AND I THINK SHE HAD PANTS ON  WITH IT BUT IT WAS A WHOLE  OUTFIT. SHE WAS WORKING THE WHOLE  OUTFIT.
Jon: WE CAN SETTLE THIS  NOW, YOU HAVE 30 MINUTES TO  GO. I THINK YOU SHOULD ASK  PEOPLE TO WEAR THE SAME  THING. EVERYONE SHOULD COME IN LIKE  THE YELLOW JUMP SUIT.
WELL, I LIKE-- I NOTICE  THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE BOOK  TOUR AND THEY ARE LIKE THAT. BUT I TALK TO PEOPLE SO MUCH  THAT THEY ARE LIKE LET ME  LET YOU GO. LET ME LET YOU GO. BECAUSE--   (LAUGHTER)  I AM EITHER IN A ROOM BY  MYSELF, I'M EITHER IN A ROOM  BY MYSELF WRITING OR I'M OUT IN THE WORLD. SO I-- AND SO IT'S GOOD  OPPORTUNITY IN THERE IS THAT  THEORY THAT I'M WORKING OR A POLL THAT I WANT TO TAKE. AND-- .
Jon: A POLL --
YEAH.
Jon: YOU'RE ASKING-- SO  AT A BOOK SIGNING SOMEONE  WILL COME UP TO YOU AND YOU ARE ASKING THEM POLLING  QUESTIONS.
YEAH. LIKE I HAVE A THEORY WHEN I  STARTED THIS TOUR THAT MEN  WITH BEARDS HAD GUNS.
Jon: UH-HUH.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE  DISCOVERED--   (LAUGHTER)
WHAT I HAVE DISCOVERED  MEN WITH BEARDS HAVE FATHERS  WHO HAVE GUNS. I'M 80% RIGHT ON THIS, 80%  RIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MEN WITH BEARDS-- HAVE  FATHERS WHO HAVE GUNS. WHERE IS THE BEARD GROWN AT  GUNPOINT? WAS THIS--   (LAUGHTER)  IS THIS A SITUATION WHERE  THEY WOULDN'T NORMALLY GROW  IT BUT THE FATHER IS LIKE, I  INSIST.
I MET A GUY AND HE WAS  FROM-- HIS FAMILY FROM  SOUTHEAST, HE HAD LIKE 17 HAIRS ON HIS CHIN. HIS DAD HAD BULLETS, NOT A  GUN. NOT A GUN. I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS GOING  TO THROW THEM AT PEOPLE OR  WHAT BUT HIS SDAD JUST HAD A BOX OF BULLETS BUT NO GUN.
Jon: DO YOU FIND THAT  DIFFERENT-- LIKE IF SOMEONE  HAD A FULL BEARD WOULD YOU BE LIKE WE HAVE TO  INVESTIGATE THIS MAN'S  FATHER. LIKE HE WOULD HAVE AN  ARSENAL, LIKE WERE SMALLER  FACIAL HAIR CONFIGURATIONS  CORRELATED WITH SMALLER  WEAPONRY?
NO, I MET PEOPLE WITH  LIKE VAN DYKES WHOSE DAD HAD  ARSENALS.
Jon: REALLY?
UH-HUH.
Jon: AND WOULD THEY EVER  BE TAKEN ABACK LIKE WHY DOW  WANT TO KNOW? LIKE THAT?
YEAH. BUT THEN ALSO ON THIS SCORE,  I WAS OUT WITH A FRIEND AND  I HAVE KNOWN HIM SINCE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL. AND WE WENT TO A RESTAURANT  FOR LUNCH AND THE WAITRESS  ASKED IF WE WANTED DESSERT. WE HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT,  WE THOUGHT OKAY, LET'S SHARE  GET A PIECE OF BANANA CREAM PIPE PIE. AND I LOOKED ACROSS THE ROOM  AND THERE WERE TWO OTHER MEN  SPLITTING A PIECE OF PIE. THEY WERE AROUND OUR AGE AND  THEY WERE GAY. I AM ASSUMING THEY WERE  WERE-- BECAUSE STRAIGHT MEN  WOULD NOT SHARE DESSERT. SO I STARTED ASKING MEN AT  THE BOOK SIGNING, WOULD  SHARE A DESSERT WITH ANOTHER  GUY. AND THEY SAID, LIKE ONE GUY  SAID YOU KNOW, WOULD SHARE A  PLATE OF BUFFALO WINGS. (LAUGHTER)  HE SAID-- BUT LIKE A PIECE  OF PIE, THAT'S JUST CROSSING  THE LINE. (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'M PRETTY SECURE IN  MY SEXUALITY BUT FOR THE  FIRST TIME BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU SAID THAT SURE I  SHARE PIE ALL THE TIME SO  NOW I HAVE TO FEEL LIKE OH,  GOD S THIS THE RIGHT LIFESTYLE I'M LEADING RIGHT  NOW. I'M GOING GO HOME TO MY WIFE  AND BE LIKE HONEY, I THINK  WE HAVE TO TALK.
I MET THESE OTHER GUYS  AND THEY HAD JUST RECENTLY  SHARED A PIECE OF CAKE BUT THEY TOLD THE WAITRESS,  WE'RE NOT GAY. LIKE THEY WANTED TO  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY  WEREN'T GAY. (LAUGHTER)
BUT THEN I MET A WHOLE  OTHER KIND OF GUY WHOSE'S  JUST ALL ABOUT THE DESSERT. AND HE WOULD EAT FROSTING  OFF ANOTHER MAN'S [BLEEP] IF  IT WAS-- IF--   (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.
IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS  BEING SERVED ON, YOU KNOW.
Jon: SEE, HERE'S HOW I  KNOW I'M NOT GAY. IN THAT SITUATION, I WOULD  DO THIS. ALL RIGHT-- ON THE BOOK  SHELVES NOW, DAVID SEDARIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
