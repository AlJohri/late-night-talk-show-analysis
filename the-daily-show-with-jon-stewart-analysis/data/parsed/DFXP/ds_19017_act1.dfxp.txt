FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS THE JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. THAT'S GOING IN THE ARCHIVES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- WOW, WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST BOB WOODRUFF. WE'LL TALK ABOUT HIS VETERANS FOUNDATION AND THE BIG BENEFIT THAT'S COMING UP. YOU REMEMBER A FEW MONTHS BACK THERE WAS TALK THE MAYOR OF TORONTO  ROB FORD WAS A CRACK HEAD. THAT THERE WAS MAYBE A PIECE OF VIDEO OF MAYOR ROB FORD OF TORONTO SMOKING -- CRACK. [ LAUGHTER ] AND ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE VIDEOTAPED, EXHIBITING THE TYPE OF POOR JUDGMENT YOU OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH SMOKING CRACK.
I CANNOT COMMENT ON A VIDEO THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN OR DOES NOT EXIST.
HE CAN'T COMMENT ON -- GOOD NEWS, EVERYBODY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD CAN COMMENT ON A VIDEO OF HIM SMOKING CRACK.
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE VIDEO OF MAYOR FORD SMOKING A CRACK PIPE AND MAKING RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS.
SMOKING CRACK AND MAKING RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS, I BELIEVE IN CANADA THAT'S REFERRED TO AS A HAT TRICK, AM I RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOCKEY BUT -- [LAUGHTER] FROM THE PICTURE OF MAYOR HERE WITH HIS CRACK-STITUENTS THE RACIST THING SEEMS TO BE ACCEPTING OF ANYBODY THAT SMOKES CRACK WITH HIM AND A HOMOPHOBE THAT ATTITUDE WON'T LAST. AT SOME POINT WHILE PURSUING THIS CRACKHEAD LIFESTYLE HE WILL END UP SUCKING SOME (bleep). [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] AND THEN HE WILL FEEL BAD FOR THE PREVIOUS REMARKS. [LAUGHTER] BUT MR. MAYOR WHILE YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO SPEAK -- [LAUGHTER] CAN YOU TELL US WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
I MADE MISTAKES. WHAT AM I THINKING?
Jon: I FIND IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IT'S BEST TO BEGIN WITH CRACK SMOKING BUT OF COURSE HE DID NOT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE GOT HAMMERED DOWN AT THE DANFORTH. IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS YOU STAY AT HOME. AND THAT'S IT YOU DON'T MAKE A PUBLIC SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ONE, I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED DOWN AT THE DANFORTH,  AND TWO, YOU REALIZE, FROM NOW ON I'M JUST GOING TO (bleep) AT HOME. MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER TO EITHER YOUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS OR YOUR JOB AS THE GUY WHO RUNS TORONTO. [ LAUGHTER ] IF YOU GUYS NEED ME I'LL BE IN THE BASEMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] GETTING ALL DRUNK AND (bleep) AND SMOKING CRACK AND SUCKING (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] MUST BE NICE TO LIVE IN A CITY SO PROBLEM FREE IT CAN BE RUN FOR YEARS BY A HARD DRINKING CRACK MAYOR. NEW YORK DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, THE CITY NEVER SLEEPS. THE BIG APPLE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BOOM! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE CITY SO NICE THEY NAMED IT TWICE LIKE SIRHAN SIRHAN. BAD EXAMPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] AS YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST DOZEN YEARS WE HERE IN NEW YORK HAVE BEEN UNDER THE CONTROL OF A SODA HATING LEPRECHAUN. [ LAUGHTER ] WHO AS YOU KNOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- PURCHASED THE CITY WITH HIS POT OF GOLD. [LAUGHTER] BUT TOMORROW NEW YORKERS WILL GO TO THE POLLS TO DECIDE WHO WILL FILL HIS SHOES, HIS TINY, TINY SHOES. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PICTURE OF THOSE SHOES. HEY! HEY, YOU -- STUART LITTLE. GET OUT OF THOSE. THOSE ARE THE MAYOR'S SHOES. GET OUT OF THERE. PS, THE MAYOR AND I ARE THE EXACT SAME SIZE. RIGHT NOW THE MAYOR'S RACE IS BETWEEN DEMOCRAT BILL DE BLASIO AND REPUBLICAN JOE LHOTA.BLASIO ALTHOUGH CALLING IT A RACE MAY BEA WEE BIT OF AN OVERSTATEMENT.
DE BLASIO HAS A 45% LEAD IN THE RACE TO BE THE BIG APPLE'S NEXT MAYOR.
Jon: 45% -- THAT'S THE SAME AMOUNT THAT HOT DOG IS BEATING RAT ON A STICK AS NEW YORK'SNG FAVORITE STREET FOOD. JOE LHOTA MAY COME IN THIRD TO DRUNK ANTISEMITIC TIMES SQUARE ELMO. BUT TO HEAR JOE LHOTA TELL IT HIS SECOND PLACE STATUS IS AN ASSET.
HE SAID HE IS THE UNDERDOG BUT ADDED NEW YORKERS LOVE AN UNDERDOG.
Jon: IF YOU WERE TEN POINTS DOWN YOU WOULD BE AN UNDERDOG. AT 50 POINTS YOU ARE A SAD DOG. YOU ARE LIKE THE KIND OF DOG THAT SARAH McLACHLAN SINGS SONGS OVER THE TOP OF. â™ª THROUGH THE ARMS OF AN ANGEL  [LAUGHTER] WOW. RIGHT NOW THERE'S A MAYOR IN TORONTO GOING I'M SMOKING WAY TOO MUCH CRACK. [LAUGHTER] I ALMOST FEEL BAD FOR JOE LHOTA. HIS OPPONENT HAS A TON OF CHARISMA RIGHT DOWN TO HIS FAMILY WITH THEIR OWN SIGNATURE DANCE MOVES. CHECK THAT OUT. HOW DO YOU FIGHT THAT?
HE TALKS A GOOD GAME BUT BOY HE CAN'T EVEN GET INTO THE FIRST INNING BECAUSE ONCE YOU ASK A DETAILED QUESTION IT'S BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT'S YOUR BEST SHOT WHEN YOU ASK HIM A QUESTION HE ANSWERS IT WITH WORDS. YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR JON CORZINE (bleep) THE GRUMPY CAT. [ LAUGHTER ] FOR MORE WE GO TO SENIOR MAYORAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, WHERE ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON I'M AT DE BLASIO HEADQUARTERS WHERE THE VICTORY PARTY IS WELL UNDER WAY.
Jon: THE ELECTION ISN'T UNTIL TOMORROW.
DOESN'T MATTER. WITH AN IMBALANCE THIS BIG, THE OLD RULE OF POLITICS DOESN'T APPLY. HE CAN DO ANYTHING. HAVE YOU SEEN HIS FINAL CAMPAIGN POSTER IT'S A DICK PIC JON
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. I DIDN'T REALIZE.
DISPLAYING YOUR PENIS IN PUBLIC IS USUALLY THE END OF A NEW YORK POLITICAL CAREER BUT WHEN DE BLASIO RELEASED THOSE PHOTOS HIS POLL NUMBERS WENT UP BY FIVE POINTS. YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE COMMERCIALS.
THIS TUESDAY VOTE FOR BILL DE BLASIO OR DON'T. EITHER WAY HE HAS GOT THIS. BILL DE BLASIO: ALREADY THE MAYOR.E BLASIO: ALREADY THE
ALREADY MAYOR, JON.
Jon: WOW.
MAYOR DE BLASIO. HE IS COMING NOW.
Jon: WHOA HE IS SO TALL. CRAZY HOW TALL HE IS. I HAVE TO SAY WHEN YOU SEE IT LIKE THIS HE IS ENORMOUS.
HE IS ALMOST IMPLAUSIBLY TALL.
Jon: ALMOST COMICALLY TALL.
SO BIG. SUCH A BIG MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WE GO.
Jon: DID HE JUST ASK YOU FOR MONEY?
OF COURSE HE DID, JON. WE NO LONGER HAVE MAYOR MONEY BAGS TRICKLING DOWN A GOLDENY SHOWER OF MONEY ON THE CITY. SO WHEN MAYOR DE BLASIO ASKS YOU FOR MONEY, YOU'D BETTER GIVE IT TO HIM. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE HIM SCOOP UP A WOMAN IN HIS ENORMOUS PAW AND TOSS HER FROM THE TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
Jon: YOU ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIM WHILE HE'S STANDING NEXT TO YOU.
HE CAN'T HEAR ME UP THERE. YOUR LACK OF MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE WILL BE WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT IN THE FACE OF WALL STREET LOBBYING. NOTHING, JON. ONLY HEARS THE BIRDS AND THE OCCASIONAL JET. HE'S VERY TALL.
Jon: HE REALLY IS. THANK YOU JOHN OLIVER AND MAYOR DE BLASIO.
