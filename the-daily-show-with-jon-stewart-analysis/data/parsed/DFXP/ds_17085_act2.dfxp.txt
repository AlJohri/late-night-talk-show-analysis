Jon: GOOGLE. GOOGLE MOST OF US USE IT EVERY DAY. HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THE REAL PROBLEM WITH GOOGLE IS IT'S TOO FAR AWAY FROM MY FACE?
GOOGLE AS UNVEILED FUTURISTIC EYEGLASSES THAT ARE LIKE SMART PHONES FOR YOUR EYES, KIND OF  LIKE IN THE TERMINATOR MOVIES. IT'S USING TECHNOLOGY CALLED AUGMENTED REALITY. THAT MEANS IT CAN TAKE DATA, INFORMATION AND LAYER IT ON TOP OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD, ON TOP OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS.
Jon: HOLY -- IT'S LIKE A NOSE-MOUNTED VERSION OF THE GOOGLE WE LOVE. SHOWING WHAT IT IS LIKE TO CRASH INTO ANY POINT ON EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE OR THE WORLD'S  LARGEST DATABASE OF PEOPLE WHIZZING IN PUBLIC. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT NOW IT WILL BE LIKE THEY ARE THERAPYING -- THEY ARE PEEING RIGHT IN YOUR EYE. LUCKILY THEY PRODUCED A VIDEO TO GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE WEARING THE GLASSES.

TECHNOLOGY STORIES THEY MAKE NO SENSE TO AMERICA I'M JOINED BY THE SENIOR YOUTH CORRESPONDENT  JESSICA WILLIAMS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO, JON.
Jon: INS INSTAGRAM. HOW IN GOD'S NAME IS THAT WORTH $1 BILLION?
WHAT? BECAUSE IT'S AWESOME BEFORE INSTAGRAM IF I WANTED MY PICTURES TO LOOK LIKE THEY WERE  TAKE INNOCENT 60s, I WOULD HAVE TO INVENT A TIME MACHINE AND TRAVEL BACK 50 YEARS. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A TIME MACHINE WOULD COST TO BUILD?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.
PROBABLY LIKE $1 BILLION. NOT TO MENTION THE RISKS ABOUT CHANGING THE PAST, SCROOGE THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM. WHAT IF I WENT BACK AND ENDED UP (bleep) MY OWN DAD? WITH INSTAGRAM I GET THE SAME PICTURES WITHOUT THE RISK OF NEVER BEING BORN.
Jon: JESS CARKS I CAN SEE THE NOVELTY OF USING THIS AGING FILTERS, MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE.
ONCE OR TWICE, JOHN I LITERALLY USE IT LIKE A BILLION TIMES A DAY.
Jon: LITERALLY?
LITERALLY.
Jon: BUT IT'S STUPID.
THEY PROBABLY SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT YOUR YOUTHFUL PAST TIMES LIKE HOPSCOTCH OR PANNING  FOR GOLD.
Jon: HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM?
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I THINK YOU ARE?
Jon: LIKE A BILLION.

Jon: LOOK, I DON'T LIKE THIS.
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT. OLD PEOPLE NEVER LIKE NEW OR FUN THINGS BUT TRUST ME A FEW YEARS FROM NOW, YOU'LL BE USING  INSTAGRAM ALL THE TIME AND WAITING FOR THE NEW GOOGLE 3 GLASSES TO COME OUT. IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE TO GET USED TO NEW THINGS.
Jon: LIKE THE BLUE TOOTH EARPIECES?

Jon: IT'S $33 FOR EVERY REGISTERED USER INS THE DWRAM HAS.
$33?
Jon: YES.
DAMN, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
Jon: YES, AND A BILLION DOLLARS IS EVEN MORE THAN THAT.
