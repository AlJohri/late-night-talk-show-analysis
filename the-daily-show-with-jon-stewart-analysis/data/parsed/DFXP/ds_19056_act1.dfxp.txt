FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR PROGRAM TONIGHT WE PREPARED IT. MY GUEST HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI WILL BE JOINING US OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S HONESTLY THE ONLY APPLAUSE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS GOTTEN IN -- [LAUGHTER] -- GOD KNOWS HOW LONG. FIRST WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF REACTION TO TUESDAY'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. PERHAPS THE MOST ALARMING REACTION CAME FROM SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO TOLD "ROLL CALL" THAT THE WORLD IS LITERALLY ABOUT TO BLOW UP. I WISH IT HAD BEEN ON CAMERA. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHAT IT MUST HAVE SOUNDED LIKE WHEN LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID THAT. HOW WOULD THAT SOUND IF LINDSEY GRAHAM WOULD SAY HELLO GOVERNOR -- NO THAT WON'T BE IT. THE WORLD IS LITERALLY ABOUT TO BLOW UP. NO, NO THAT WOULDN'T BE IT. HEY WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO THE WORLD -- NO, NO, NOT IT. I, SENATOR GRAHAM DO BELIEVE -- I DO DECLARE THAT THIS TERRESTRIAL VESSEL WHICH WE INHABIT IS ABOUT TO JUST EXPLODE AND ME JUST HERE ALL ALONE IN MY SITTING ROOM SURROUNDED BY SWEET TEA AND JUST MY FIGURINES. [ LAUGHTER ] I DIDN'T TAKE GRAHAM SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, THAT THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO BLOW UP. YOU KNOW HOW EXCITABLE SOUTHERNERS CAN GET -- [LAUGHTER] -- UNTIL I SAW THIS.
THE METROPOLITAN ATLANTA AREA LARGELY PARALYZED.
PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN TRAPPED ON THE ROADS.
CHILDREN LEFT TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THEIR SCHOOLS.
AN ABANDONED CAR PURGATORY.
LIKE THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.
THE WALKING DEAD.
Jon: LORD HAVE MERCY, LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS RIGHT. HE WAS RIGHT. I HAVE ALWAYS DEPENDED ON THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS TO GIVE ME A RIDE. [ LAUGHTER ] THE ICE AGE ZOMBIE DOOMSDAY APOCALYPSE HAS COME TO ATLANTA. DAMN YOU, GAY MARRIAGE! WHY DIDN'T WE LISTEN? I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE -- [LAUGHTER] -- I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW MUCH SNOW IT MUST TAKE TO BRING ABOUT THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, THREE FEET, TEN FEET.
TWO INCHES OF SNOW HIT THE AREA. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: REALLY, TWO INCHES OF SNOW? I MEAN IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SOUTH IS CONFRONTED BY SOMETHING NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED IN REVELATIONS? IS THAT -- [LAUGHTER] -- WE'RE READY FOR THE HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE AND RIVERS OF BLOOD BUT JESUS DIDN'T SAY NOTHING HERE ABOUT SNOW TIRES. [LAUGHTER] AND THAT IS NOT TO DIMINISH THE REAL TROUBLE THE STORM HAS CAUSED. I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE IN ATLANTA'S SNOWSHOES RIGHT NOW.
JENNIFER WILKIN HAS BEEN IN HER CAR MORE THAN 20 HOURS.
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW SPENT THE NIGHT IN A HOME DEPOT.
A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN SITTING IN A WALGREENS FOR 19 HOURS.
SHE HAD TO SLEEP IN THE CAR. THEY HAD A FRIEND COME AND DELIVER FOOD TO THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: FRIEND DIDN'T HAVE ANY EXTRA SPACE IN THEIR CAR? MAYBE GIVEN THEM A RIDE HOME SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO SLEEP -- HEY, MAN, HEARD ABOUT YOUR TROUBLE. HERE IS COCA-COLA AND SLIM JIMS. GOTTA GO. THEY COULD HAVE SHARED -- IT'S OKAY FOR TWO PEOPLE TO SHARE A CAR RIGHT. I KNOW THE LAST TIME ANYONE IN ATLANTA CAR POOLED WAS THIS BUT STILL THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW IS GEORGIA SO ILL-PREPARED, GOVERNOR?
WE HAVE BEEN CONFRONTED WITH AN UNEXPECTED STORM. THERE'S NOT ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THAT COULD HAVE PREDICTED THE DEGREE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM THAT DEVELOPED.
Jon: SURE, I GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE UNLESS ANYONE IN THAT ROOM HAD BEEN WATCHING WHAT I GUESS YOU CALL THE WEATHER.
THE WEATHER CHANNEL HAS THE LATEST.
WE HAVE WINTER STORM WATCHES AND WARNINGS TO ATLANTA. THERE WILL BE SNOW, SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN.
TWO INCHES OF SNOW THAT WILL SHUT DOWN THE CITY.
ACCUMULATION OF 1-2 INCHES.
Jon: FOR GOD SAKES GOVERNOR YOU WERE GIVEN A MEMO THAT SAID STORM ABOUT TO STRIKE ATLANTA. YOU WERE WARNED AND THE CALL WAS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.
THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS ACTUALLY LOCATED IN ATLANTA.
Jon: THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS LOCATED IN ATLANTA. IT'S RIGHT THERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALSO LOCATED IN ATLANTA -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- ALSO LOCATED IN ATLANTA THE SOCIETY OF FOR PREVENTION OF HIGHWAY STUCKAGE -- AND THE NATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF SEEING (bleep) COMING. I'M GOING TO ASK WHERE WERE THE MAYOR AND GOVERNOR WHEN THE CITIZENS OF ATLANTA WERE STUCK IN THEIR CARS EATING THEIR OWN PEE-SICLES?
THE MAYOR TWEETED ATLANTA WE'RE READY FOR THE SNOW. HERE HE IS A SHORT TIME LATER NOT IN A SITUATION ROOM OR EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER BUT WITH GEORGIA GOVERNOR ACCEPTING AN AWARD FOR GEORGIAN OF THE YEAR.
Jon: WHO DID HE BEAT OUT? PAULA DEEN AND THE GUY WHO RAPED NED BEATTY IN DELIVERANCE? HOW DID LOCAL MEDIA HANDLE IT? THIS IS THE CONTINUING COVERAGE OF WINTER STORM AND STATE OF EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE A TEAM OF 25 REPORTERS SPREAD OUT ALL OVER METRO ATLANTA IN NORTH GEORGIA.
Jon: IT'S A 25 NEWSBOX PILEUP. [ LAUGHTER ] WE GO NOW TO AASIF MANDVI LIVE THERE IN ATLANTA. HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON, THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS CHAOS.
Jon: SORRY, AASIF I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
THIRD ROW DOWN, JON, FOUR COLUMNS IN.
Jon: THAT'S ONE, TWO, THREE --
I'M ONE OF ONLY TWO BROWN DUDES, JON.
Jon: I SEE THE ONE GUY. I SEE YOU. I SEE YOU AASIF THERE YOU ARE.
FINALLY, YEAH.
Jon: AASIF, ONE THING I'M UNCLEAR THOUGH HOW COULD ATLANTA BE SO STRONGLY EFFECTED BY THE SNOW FALL WHEN IT'S JUST TWO INCHES?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN JON, JUST TWO INCHES? I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT TWO INCHES IS A LOT MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN IT SOUNDS. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT OTHER CITIES HAVING 12, 13 INCHES, YEAH RIGHT. MAYBE IN THE MOVIES. THERE'S PLENTY OF CITIES OUT THERE WHO FIND TWO INCHES WAY TOO MUCH TO HANDLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I GUESS I SUPPOSE IN SOME SITUATIONS I COULD SEE -- AASIF WHERE DID YOU GO? YOU MOVED TO A DIFFERENT -- WHERE ARE YOU?
(bleep). I THINK THEY MOVED ME, JON. IT'S CHAOS.
Jon: WHERE ARE YOU NOW? I HAVE NO IDEA.
I I'M TOLD I'M IN BOX 18 B. IT'S IN --
Jon: I GOTCHA. OKAY. TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON.
THE POINT IS IT'S NOT THE SIZE OF SNOW FALL THAT MATTERS. IT'S THE DURATION OF THE CONDENSATION IF YOU GET MY SNOW DRIFT.
Jon: ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL US YOU HAVE A TWO INCH PENIS? [LAUGHTER]
WHAT? I WISH! IN THIS (bleep) COLD IT'S HALF THAT, OKAY. OH, NO IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
Jon: WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW? NO AASIF WHAT IS HAPPENING?
THANK YOU AASIF, TAKE CARE. AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
