[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. NOW THIS WEEK WE CELEBRATED MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.'S BIRTHDAY, AS ALWAYS AN OCCASION TO PAUSE AND ASSESS HOW FAR THAT WE'VE COME IN TERMS OF RACE RELATIONS. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE, LARRY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ON THIS AUSPICIOUS OCCASION, LARRY, HOW FAR HAVE WE COME IN RACE RELATIONS?
WELL, JON, I THINK I CAN MOST ELOQUENTLY EXPRESS MY ANSWER IN THE FORM OF AN AWARDS SHOW.
Jon: SORRY?
ROLL IT, CHUCK.
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND TELL EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE.
NASTY THINGS TO AFRODONE. AMERICANS.
GEORGE BUSH DIDN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE.
DON'T YOU EVER TALK ABOUT ME.
WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU?
COMEDY CENTRAL PRESENTS THE FIRST ANNUAL WILMORE AWARDS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT.  THE WILMORES?
HERE WE GO, JON.
Jon: WHAT? OK. WHAT IS THAT A WRECKING BALL THERE?
YEAH, YEAH. WE'RE HONORING THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AS BLACK PEOPLE.
Jon: THAT'S NICE. ISN'T THAT ACTUALLY WHAT THE NAACP IMAGE AWARDS ARE FOR?
PLEASE, JON HAVE YOU SEEN HOW MANY WHITE PEOPLE ARE NOMINATED FOR BLACK IMAGE AWARDS THIS YEAR? JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, DALLAS BUYER'S CLUB, MODERN FAMILY, ROBIN THICKE. THOUGH, I WILL ADMIT, BLURRED LINES IS A PRETTY INCLUSIVE VIDEO AND DR. KING IS ON RECORD FOR SAYING,  I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY BLACK GIRLS WILL DANCE NAKED WITH WHITE GIRLS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YEAH I DON'T THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID THAT.
DOESN'T MEAN HE DIDN'T DREAM IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO THE -- THIS IS A WRECKING BALL, YES?
YES, THIS IS THE WRECKING BALL. RIGHT THERE, VERY NICE.
Jon: VERY NICE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DESIGNED IT MYSELF.
Jon: VERY NICE.
NOW THE WILMORES HONOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS THAT NOBODY ASKED YOU TO BREAK. OKAY? THE FIRST EVER WILMORE AWARD GOES TO THE NAACP IMAGE AWARDS. [  APPLAUSE  ]
Jon: VERY NICE.
FOR GIVING BLACK ARTISTS YET ANOTHER CHANCE TO LOSE TO WHITE NOMINEES AT THE VERY CEREMONY INVENTED TO HONOR BLACK ARTISTS.
Jon: I GET THE SENSE THE WILMORE WILL NOT BE A COVETED AWARD.
OF COURSE IT IS, JON. I KNOW YOU WANT IT.
Jon: NO, I DON'T WANT IT.
THE NEXT WILMORE IS THE I'M SO COLOR BLIND I DON'T SEE BLACK PEOPLE AWARD. IT GOES TO GIANT GROCERY STORE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR WELCOMING STUDENTS BACK TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY, AN HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE, WITH THIS AD. SO THE MESSAGE IS, HEY BROTHERS ORDER A PIZZA, YOU GET A FREE WHITE WOMAN?.
Jon: BUT ISN'T BEING COLOR BLIND A GOOD THING?
WHEN THERE'S NOBODY AROUND BUT BLACK PEOPLE THAT'S NOT COLOR BLIND, THAT'S JUST BLIND. [LAUGHTER] THE NEXT AWARD CATEGORY IS OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT IN VICTIM OPPRESSOR ROLE REVERSAL.
SARAH PALIN HAS A MESSAGE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. PALIN WROTE, "MR. PRESDENT, IN HONOR OF MARTIN LUTHER KING AND ALL WHO COMMIT TO ENDING ANY RACIAL DIVIDE, NO MORE PLAYING THE RACE CARD.
JON, WHAT AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE! OH, MY GOSH! THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT SHE DID, JON, TO PULL THE RACIAL VICTIMHOOD SWITCH-AROO ON MLK'S BIRTHDAY.
Jon: I HAVE A FEELING SARAH PALIN WILL WIN A LOT OF THESE BAD BOYS. SHE'LL BE LIKE THE MERYL STREEP OF THE WILMORE AWARDS.
I DON'T GET IT.
Jon: LIKE A TALENTED PERSON WHO WINS A -- I MEAN THE ANGELA BASSETT.
THAT'S FUNNY, I GET IT. [ LAUGHTER ] -- FUNNY JOKE. THAT'S GOOD. OK. NOW ON TO THE MAJOR BOUNDARY BREAKERS. NEXT IS THE AWARD FOR WHITE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT'S OKAY NOW FOR THEM TO USE THE N WORD. AND THE WINNER IS MADONNA.
MADONNA POSTED A PICTURE OF HER SON ROCCO BOXING AND THE CAPTION WAS MAMA SAID KNOCK YOU OUT #DIS-N WORD.
ADOPTING A BLACK KID ISN'T LIKE GETTING A FLU SHOT. IT DOESN'T INNOCULATE YOU FROM USING THE PHRASE DIS [N-WORD].
Jon: IF THAT'S WHAT SHE CALLS THE WHITE KID WHAT DOES SHE CALL THE ADOPTED CHILDREN FROM AFRICA.
I DON'T KNOW DOSE [N-WORD].
Jon: DID I INTERRUPT?
NO IT'S JUST TIME FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE RACISTS WE LOST THIS YEAR. ♪  FOR THE RACISTS WE LOST THIS YEAR. ♪  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE ON THE WEEK OF MLK'S BIRTHDAY?
YES, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE, JON. NOW LOOK, WE'VE MADE SOME GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS RACIAL HARMONY BUT IT'S STILL DISCOURAGING THAT A BLACK MAN CAN'T GET PASSIONATE ABOUT SOMETHING HE HAS WORKED HARD FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE WITHOUT A BUNCH OF ANONYMOUS RACISTS ON TWITTER UNLEASHING A [N-WORD]-LANCHE OF INSULTS. UNTIL THAT CHANGES, I'LL KEEP GIVING THESE OUT.
Jon: WELL, LET'S HOPE OUR SOCIETY UNDERGOES A KIND OF [N-WORD]ALUTION, IF YOU WILL. HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CHANGE THINGS. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
Jon: LARRY WILMORE,  EVERYBODY WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
