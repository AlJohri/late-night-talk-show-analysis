I WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU PERSONY DEL YORANDA ONE OF MY TOP HOMICIDE  PROSECUTORS AND JOHN GUIDE, MY OTHER TOP HOMICIDE PROSECUTOR. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HELLON -- HELLO BERNIE, JOHN, JOHN, AUDIENCE, AUDIENCE, BERNIE, JOHN CAN. WE JUST GET TO THE [BLEEP] CHARGES?
DESPITE ALL THAT IS ON THEIR PLATE ALREADY, HANDLING ALL OF THE HOMICIDES IN THE FOURTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, SUPERVISING THE OTHER YOUNG LAWYERS WHO ALSO HANDLE HOMICIDES, THEY WILLINGLY TOOK THIS CASE ON.
Jon: YES, YES, YES, FLORIDA IS A LAWLESS NETHERLAND, YOU'RE ASS-DEEP IN MURDER VICTIMS. ARE YOU GO TOING CHARGE THIS GUY OR WHAT?
UNLESS YOU HAVE EVER BEEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR A PROSECUTOR HANDLING A  DIFFICULT HOMICIDE CASE, YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LAUNCH THIS TYPE OF  INVESTIGATION AND COME TO THE RIGHT CONCLUSION J&J.
Jon: WE CANNOT KNOW. YOU DON'T THINK WE CAN KNOW? WE'RE AMERICAN. ALL WE WATCH IS [BLEEP] LAW SHOWS, SIX TO 10 HOURS A DAY, LAW & ORDER, CSI, NCI, ORDER, SUV, THERE'S LIKE FOUR SHOWS WHERE PSYCHIC SOLVE CRIMES. WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA HOW THIS WORKS. GET TO THE CHARGES.
TODAY WE FILED AN INFORMATION CHARGING GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WITH MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE. WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAR IN FRONT OF A MAGISTRATE IN SEMINOLE COUNTY WITHIN 24  HOURS OF HIS ARREST.
Jon: WHERE HE CAN PLEAD GUILTY, NOT GUILTY OR ACCORDING TO FLORIDA LAW, SHOOT THE MAGISTRATE. (LAUGHTER) OKAY. SO FINALLY AFTER HOPEFULLY DOING HIS DUE DILIGENCE THE STATE HAS FOUND IT HAS IT IS  IN ITS INTEREST TO CHARGE MR. ZIMMERMAN WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER, REACTIONS.
WE JUST WANTED AN ARREST. AND WE GOT IT. AND I SAY THANK YOU.
WE TO YOU HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE. IT'S A VERY GOOD PROCESS. BEST NFT WORLD. AND IT WORKS PRETTY WELL. WE HAVE TO LET IT WORK. WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND HAVE FAITH IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.
Jon: I'M SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SPECIFIC, NOT THE CALM, RATIONAL HEARTFELT  REACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CASE LIKE THE MARTIN FAMILY, WHEN THEY TIMELY GAIN A MEASURE OF PEACE OR GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S LAWYER, I MEAN  THE REACTIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY MATTER, THE MEDIA.
THE STATE OF FLORIDA VERSUS GEORGE ZIMMERMAN. COUNT ONE.
WELL, THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF ANTICIPATION ESPECIALLY BY THE MEDIA.
MANY LEGAL EXPERTS ARE SAYING THAT THEY OVERCHARGED HIM.
THIS STORY BECAME WITHOUT A DOUBT INARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED TO  BE UP ON IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
HE VINCING A DEPRAVED MIND.
COULD THIS BE THE TRIAL OF THE DECADE?
I DO THINK THERE WILL BE A NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN DON'T KNOW. AFTER TOT MOM, FRANKLY, THE PLACE IS UP FOR GRABS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS, I KNOW IN MY HEART THAT THE 2006 DUKE LACROSSE  TEAM IS INVOLVED IN THIS SOMEHOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW. BUT I'M GOING TO FIND OUT. SO MEDIA HUNGRY. WHICH MEAL WILL THEY BE SERVED. WILL THIS TRIAL BE THE CLASSIC CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM COVERAGE LIKE OJ WHERE THE GRIZZLY DEATH OF  TWO PEOPLE SOMEHOW ENDS UP AS THE DANCING-- ON JAY LENO OR THE NO CAMERAS IN THE  COURTROOM 340D EL WHERE JOURNALISTS DESPERATE TO REPORT THE OUTCOME MILLI SECRETARIES BEFORE THEIR  ARRIVAL USE THE ANCIENT YET REMARKABLY ACCURATE ART OF SELLA PHORE USE THE-- TO DELAY --
COUNT ONE, COUNT TWO-- ON COUNT FOUR, SHE IS-- THAT IS-- GUILTY, MICHAEL.
I'M SORRY, GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY.
NOT GUILTY ON THE COUNT OF MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS. NOT GUILTY ON MAKING AND USING FALSE DOCUMENTS.
FALSE STATEMENTS --
ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WILL GET YOU TO HOLD ON. BECAUSE VICTORIA --.
RON, RON, RON, RON.
YES.
I APOLOGISE BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, IT IS ABSOLUTELY T IS CHAOTIC OUT HERE.
Jon: I MEAN WE COULD HAVE JUST WAITED FOR SOMEONE TO WALK OVER WITH THE LIST BUT, NO. THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A SECOND. WE SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH MY ORIGINAL SUGGESTION, VERDICT BEARS. (LAUGHTER) SO WHAT KIND OF SPECTACLE WILL WE BE DEALING WITH HERE?
FLORIDA HAS WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE SUNSHINE LAW. CAMERAS ARE VIRTUALLY ALWAYS IN THE COURTROOM SO THIS TRIAL WILL BE A TRIAL ON TELEVISION.
Jon: SO DANCING EOTS IT IS. WE'RE JOINED BY JOHN OLIVER FOR MORE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO BASICALLY HERE WE GO AGAIN.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. TWO MONTHS FROM NOW, THREE MONTHS FROM NOW WHEN THIS TRIAL REALLY GETS GOING IT WILL BE A CIRCUS. THE MEDIA WILL DESCEND LIKE LOCUST, A LIGHT ON ALL THAT PASSES OVER.
Jon: THEY ARRAIGNED ZIMMAN TODAY, THERE IS ALL KINDS OF DFERB --.
WAIT, WHOA, WHOA, IS THAT TRUE.
Jon: YEAH, THEY ARRAIGNED HIM --
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS HAPPENING ON CAMERA DOWN THERE NOW.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY, NO THE CAMERAS IN FLORIDA, JUST TODAY THERE WAS THE  ARRAIGNMENT THAT THEY DID. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE IS GOING-- JOHN?  JOHN? JOHN OLIVER. I --
GOOD EVENING, JON, THIS IS JOHN OLIVER. REPORTING. (APPLAUSE) JOHN, I'M REPORTING LIVE OUTSIDE THE SEMINOLE COUNTY COURTHOUSE IN FLORIDA.
Jon: HOW-- YOU'RE THERE ALREADY.

Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAKE THE COURTHOUSE OUT.
RIGHT, RIGHT, SHOULD I COME BACK TO NEW YORK AND CEDE MY COURT FRONT PROPERTY  TO TUBING OR EVEN WIRED FOR THAT MATTER, NO WAY-- WYATT, WHEN DID YOU GET DOWN THERE.
I LEFT AS SOON AS I SAW OLIVER FLY OUTDOOR. WHEN THE STAMPEDE STARTS YOU'RE EITHER PART OF THE HERD OR YOU GET TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT. THIS GOING TO BE THE TRIAL OF THE MILLENNIUM.
HE'S RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY CALLING IT THE TRIAL OF THE MILL ENYUM.
Jon: WHO'S CALLING IT THAT WAY.
WYATT CINAC JUST DID.
YUP, I DID.
GOOD JOB.
Jon: WE NEED NOT BE VUL TURS. ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WAS RUSH TO JUDGEMENT. LET'S LET THE STORY PLAY OUT. LET'S LET THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
EXACTLY.
Jon: WHAT IS?
TONIGHT IS THE MEDIA RUSHING TO JUDGEMENT ON WHAT MANY ARE CALLING 9 TRIAL OF  THE MILLENNIUM. OR SHOULD THEY AS SOME SAY JUST LET THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
