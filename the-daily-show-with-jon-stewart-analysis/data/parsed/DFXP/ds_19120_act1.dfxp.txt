FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. THANKS FOR JOINING US. MY GUEST TONIGHT, I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY THIS, HIS NAME IS DANIEL SCHULMAN. HE IS THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK CALLED "SONS OF WICHITA," WHICH IS THE SOMEWHAT LESS-EXCITING SEQUEL TO "SONS OF ANARCHY." ACTUALLY, IT'S ABOUT THE RISE OF THE BILLIONAIRE LIBERTARIAN KOCH BROTHERS, WHO IF YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY, YOU KNOW THEY ARE RUINING THE COUNTRY AND FUNDING THE BALLET. SO WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THESE CATS, BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, THERE WAS REAL MILESTONE IN THE FIGHT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY.
THIS AFTERNOON THE LAST STATE WITHOUT A LEGAL CHALLENGE TO ITS AS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN GOT ONE. SEVEN COUPLES FILED A FEDERAL LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN FARGO.
Jon: OH, YEAH. YEAH. NO, NO. NO, THEY DID. YEAH, EQUALITY DESCENDING ON NORTH DAKOTA, DON'T YOU KNOW. YEAH. OH, IT'S LIKE A BIG GAY POLAR VORTEX, YEAH. IT'S COMING. SURE. SURE. MARRIAGE INEQUALITY, IT'S NOT THE ONLY WRONG BEING RIGHTED IN THE COUNTRY.
AN ALABAMA APPEALS COURT STRIKING DOWN THAT STATE'S BAN ON GAY SEX. ON MONDAY THE COURT OVERTURNED ALABAMA'S ANTI-SODOMY LAW, DECLARING IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
Jon: THAT'S GREAT. IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HOMOPHOBES FIND OUT THAT SODOMY, EVEN INCLUDES [BLEEPED] JOBS THEY MIGHT GET. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. A CHEERLEADER SUCKING MY [BLEEPED] IS SODOMY? I GUESS I AM A LIBERTARIAN. YOU KNOW... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OH, THANK YOU. THANKS. OUR AUDIENCE TONIGHT VERY FOND OF ORAL SEX. AY AY AY IS RIGHT. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAYING, THOUGH, CIVIL RIGHTS TRIUMPHS ALWAYS COME IN THREES. WILL IT BE BRIGHAM YOUNG CELEBRATES FIRST GAY QUARTERBACK, CARDINAL DOLAN MARCHES IN NEW YORK PRIDE PARADE, MISSISSIPPI MARRIES LOUISIANA? WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?
AT ITS ANNUAL CONVENTION OVER THE WEEKEND, THE TEXAS REPUBLICAN PARTY ENDORSED A CONTROVERSIAL THERAPY THAT REPORTS TO FIX GAY PEOPLE. IT'S KNOWN AS REPARATIVE OR GAY CONVERSION THERAPY.
Jon: WHAT? WHAT? TEXAS? WHAT? THE STATE THAT CAN'T EVEN GO A WEEK WITHOUT AN OIL PIPELINE SPEWING THINKS IT'S THE GAYS THAT NEED REPAIRING? [LAUGHTER] WHILE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY INCHES FORWARD ON GAY RIGHTS, TEXAS APPARENTLY HOPPING INTO DOC BROWN'S DeLOREAN AND SETTING THE DIAL TO THE 1950s. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S GAYWATCH TEXAS EDITION: REMEMBER THE NO-HOMO. REPARATIVE THERAPY -- REPARATIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN DERIDED AS PRAYING THE GAY WAY. IS THERE ANYBODY THAT PUTS A MORE POSITIVE SPIN ON IT?
WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF, OTHERS ARE TRYING TO GET THE GAY OUT OF PEOPLE.
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WAY OF PHRASING IT. I WOULD RATHER SAY WE ARE TRYING TO BRING OUT THE HETEROSEXUALITY IN YOU. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT THAT'S THE THING THEY DON'T HAVE IN THEM. [LAUGHTER] IT'S LIKE GIVING A WOMAN A C-SECTION WHO'S NOT PREGNANT. YOU, YOU WON'T FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. BUT YOU WILL LEAVE A SCAR. SEEING AS YOU WANT TO FRAME THE DEBATE IN A MORE PLEASING WAY, PERHAPS WE SHOULD MENTION THAT SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES REPARATIVE THERAPISTS USE TO BRING OUT A PERSON'S HETEROSEXUALITY INVOLVES THREATENING TO HOOK THEIR GENITALS UP TO ELECTRODES OR ORDERING SOMEONE TO BOTTLE THEIR FECES AND SNIFF IT WHENEVER THEY ARE ATTRACTED TO A MAN. BY THE WAY, NOT ONLY IS [BLEEPED] IN A BOTTLE AN INEFFECTIVE AND HARMFUL THERAPY, IT IS BY FAR THE WORST NEW JERSEY SHORE SOUVENIR EVER. ALTHOUGH, YOU GOT WONDER, HOW DID THE GET THE [BLEEPED] IN THERE? [LAUGHTER] NO, IF YOU'RE ON THE BOARDWALK AND YOU KNOCK DOWN THE THREE PENGUINS, YOU GET ONE OF THOSE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE [BLEEPED] BOTTLE SNIFFING AND REPARATIVE THERAPY IN GENERAL THAT IS BEING EMBRACED BY THE TEXAS REPUBLICANS HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DISCREDITED. IS THERE SOMEONE DOWN THERE WHO CAN EXPLAIN THE GOP'S POSITION?
WHETHER OR NOT YOU FEEL COMPELLED TO FOLLOW A PARTICULAR LIFESTYLE OR NOT, YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECIDE NOT TO DO THAT.
Jon: OH, BOY. RICK PERRY'S USING WORDS AGAIN. [LAUGHTER] THIS AIN'T GOING TO END WELL.
I MADE THE POINT OF TALKING ABOUT ALCOHOLISM. I MAY HAVE THE GENETIC CODING THAT I'M INCLINED TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC, BUT I HAVE THE DESIRE NOT TO DO THAT. AND I LOOK AT THE HOMOSEXUAL ISSUE AS THE SAME WAY.
WHAT, A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE? [LAUGHTER] WORRIED A GAY PERSON, THEY'LL BE OUT, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP AT ONE [BLEEPED] AND THEN AFTER HAVING TOO MANY [BLEEPED] GET INTO THEIR GAY MOBILE AND REAR END SOMEBODY? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT? A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED? LIKE ALCOHOLISM, GAY PEOPLE JUST NEED A BAR TENDER TO SEE THEM AND JUST GO, NO YOU HAD ENOUGH [BLEEPED]. LET ME CALL YOU A CAB. BUT IF YOU'RE INTO BLANK STARES, WATCH THE FAMOUSLY BUSINESS FRIENDLY TEXAS GOVERNOR GET CALLED OUT ON THE FAMOUSLY BUSINESS FRIENDLY NEWS NETWORK.
I HAVE A REALLY HIGH BAR FOR, FOR WHAT I WOULD TAKE OFFENSE TO, BUT THAT WOULD EXCEED THE BAR FOR ME. I DON'T THINK GAY MARRIAGE LEADS TO CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR D.U.I.s. I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S SIMILAR.
I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THAT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JUST CAUSE YOUR OPINIONS ARE BASED IN FACT DOESN'T MEAN THAT... LOOK, JOE, TO BE HONEST, I THOUGHT PUTTING THESE GLASSES ON WOULD BE REPARATIVE TO MY DUMBNESS, BUT THE DUMB'S COMING BACK. SOMEBODY BRING ME MY SMELLING TURDS. GIVEN THAT ALL REPUTABLE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND DOCTORS HAVE REPUDIATED REPARATIVE THERAPY AND THAT THE LARGEST REPARATIVE THERAPY PURVEYOR EVEN APOLOGIZED FOR THE DAMAGE THEY CAUSED, WHY WOULD TEXAS TEACH THE CONTROVERSY, SO TO SPEAK? >>THE LANGUAGE IS IN THE PLATORM BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTS. THIS IS ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE CHOICES.
Jon: OH, THIS IS ABOUT TEXAS G.O.P. BEING PRO-CHOICE. THEY WANT TO PRESERVE CHOICE FOR THEIR CITIZENS, CHOICE IN THEIR LIVES, IN THEIR HEALTH CARE OPTIONS. WELL, SOME OF THEIR HEALTH CARE OPTIONS.
MORE THAN SIX MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS STATE DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. IT'S ABOUT 24% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY EXCHANGES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO EXPAND MEDICAID.
Jon: SO GAY REPARATIVE THERAPY, YES! HUMAN BODY REPARATIVE THERAPY, EH. IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE SIX MILLION TEXANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TELL THEM YOU THINK YOUR ARTHRITIS IS MAKING YOU GAY. WHAT'S THAT, SON? WHAT'S THAT, SON? WHAT? YOU FEEL LIKE WHEN IT'S ABOUT TO RAIN YOU WANT TO SUCK [BLEEPED]? WELL, PUT AWAY YOUR WALLET. YOU DON'T NEED TO CO-PAY THE GAY AWAY. COME ON IN! YOU KNOW WHAT'S SAD? BEING GAY IS NOT A CHOICE, BUT BEING A TEXAS REPUBLICAN IS. SO MY ADVICE IS THE NEXT TIME YOU FEEL THE URGE TO BE A TEXAS REPUBLICAN, TO REPLACE SCIENCE, TEXTBOOKS WITH PICTURES OF HUMANS RIDING DINOSAURS OR BAN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE OR PUT ON THIS HAT, [BLEEPED] IN A JAR AND SNIFF IT. IT WON'T CURE YOU. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NO WAIT. IT WON'T CURE YOU. IT WON'T CURE YOU. THE SCIENCE PROVES THAT. BUT DO IT ANYWAY. HOPEFULLY IT WILL REMIND YOU OF WHAT ASSHOLES YOU'RE BEING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
