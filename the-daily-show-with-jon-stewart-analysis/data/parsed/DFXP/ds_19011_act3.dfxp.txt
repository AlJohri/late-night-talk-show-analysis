[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THINGS THAT MATTER:  THREE DECADES OF PASSIONS, PAST TIMES AND POLITICS." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THIS IS THE BOOK. HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THAT THERE IN HERE. THERE YOU GO. "THINGS THAT MATTER" 30 YEARS DO YOU EVER LOOK BACK AND THINK WHAT WAS I THINKING?
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: GO AHEAD.
THE WORST PART OF WRITING THE BOOK IS GOING ALL THE WAY BACK AND READING THE MILLION WORDS I'D WRITTEN. BY THE END OF THIS PROCESS I WAS NEAR SUICIDAL. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'D WRITTEN SOME OF THAT STUFF.
Jon: WHAT HAS THE GROWTH PROCESS BEEN LIKE?
THE GROWTH PROCESS? WELL, I WAS ONCE A LIBERAL. --
Jon: SO THE EARLY WRITINGS SHOWED HOPE?
AND THEN CAME CHANGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. YOUR POLITICS HAVE SHIFTED FROM LIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE. HERE IS MY ISSUE WITH CONSERVATIVE POLITICS AS THEY STAND RIGHT NOW. IT'S TOO EASY. IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNANCE. IF YOUR MANTRA IS GOVERNMENT CANNOT HELP, THEN ANY CHAOS OR LETHARGY THAT YOU SOW INTO THE GOVERNMENT HELPS TO PROVE YOUR POINT. YOU HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE. THAT WOULD BE TRUE BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE ASSUMPTION IS A CARICATURE. THESSUMPTION CONSERVATIVE IDEA IS NOT THAT GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE. YOU MIGHT HAVE ARGUED THAT IN THE 30S WHEN THE CONSERVATIVES ARGUED AGAINST THE NEW DEAL. THERE'S NO QUESTION OF ACCEPTING THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS OF LIBERALISM, THE NEW DEAL, SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID, MEDICARE. THE IDEA THAT YOU DON'T ALLOW THE ELDERLY TO ENTER INTO DESTITUTION IS A CONSENSUAL IDEA THAT AT LEAST THE MAINSTREAM OF CONSERVATIVES.
Jon: I WOULD SAY THAT THE RHETORIC IS THE SAME. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RHETORIC WHEN CONSERVATIVES OPPOSED THE NEW DEAL, OPPOSED SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE IT'S IDENTICAL. TED CRUZ QUOTES RONALD REAGAN'S MEDICARE SPEECH IN 1960 AS HE OPPOSED OBAMACARE.
TED CRUZ IS NOT THE SPOKESMAN
TFOR CONSERVATIVES. AS ANSMAN ALTERNATIVE,  PAUL RYAN. LET ME START WITH HIS ASSUMPTION. IT'S NOT THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE. HIS ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE WELFARE STATE AS ESTABLISHED WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY LIBERALS HAS NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT NO LONGER FITS. WITH THE NEW DEMOGRAPHICS AND HIGHER TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE, WE'LL SIMPLY BECOME INSOLVENT UNLESS WE RADICALLY REFORM. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE FACT. WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY WAS INSTITUTED, THE AGE OF LONGEVITY WAS 62. TODAY LIFE EXPECTANCY IS 80. SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A HUGE CHANGE IN THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND WHEN YOU LOOK TO EUROPE WHICH IS THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC STATE WHERE WE'RE HEADED WHICH HAS ALL THE ENTITLEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES WHICH A LIBERAL WOULD WANT AND -- TO WHICH AMERICAN LIBERALISM IS HEADED IT BECAME INSOLVENT BECAUSE IT NEVER ADAPTED TO THE CHANGE IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND TECHNOLOGY.
Jon: IF IT WAS EVER PRESENTED IN THAT FASHION, THE WAY YOU JUST PRESENTED IT, I THINK THE CONVERSATION WE WOULD BE HAVING IN THIS COUNTRY IS VERY DIFFERENT.
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS BOOK. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO THIS BOOK IS THE ONE THAT PRESENTS IT.
ONE BOOK IS ALL YOU NEED. THIS IS IT. YOU DON'T NEED MORE.
Jon: EVEN PAUL RYAN DOES NOT PRESENT IT IN THE MANNER OF THE GREAT VICTORIES OF LIBERALISM MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY, THE GREAT SOCIAL SAFETY NET THAT LIBERALS HAVE HELPED BUILD AND FOUGHT FOR. IT'S PRESENTED AS PROGRESSIVISM IS DESTROYING OUR NATION, OBAMACARE IS GOING TO CHANGE US FROM NOT BEING AMERICA ANYMORE AND I THINK GERMANY WOULD ARGUE WITH YOUR ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THAT A SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC STATE CANNOT PROSPER AND CREATE WEALTH.
LOOK, YOU DON'T EXPECT A POLITICIAN TO SPEND HALF HIS SPEECH PRAISING THE OTHER SIDE. SO IT'S A MATTER OF TIME CONSTRAINTS. I HAVE A LOT OF TIME. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE THE BOOK DONE, I HAD 30 YEARS. IT'S IN ONE BOOK. EASY TO CARRY ON.
Jon: I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE AUDIENCE THAT NEEDS TO READ IT. GIVE IT TO PAUL RYAN AND TED CRUZ. CRDON'T GIVE IT TO THEM, THEY KNOW. CAN YOU STICK AROUND. CANWE'LL BE BACK WITH CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.
