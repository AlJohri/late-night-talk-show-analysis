[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUST TONIGHT, A DIRECTOR, HIS LATEST FILM IS CALLED "BOYHOOD."
GOOD-BYE, YARD. GOOD-BYE, MAILBOX. GOOD-BYE, BOX OF STUFF MOMMY WON'T LET US TAKE WITH US BUT WE DON'T WANT TO THROW AWAY. GOOD-BYE, HOUSE. I'LL NEVER LIKE MOMMY AS MUCH FOR MAKING US MOVE.
SAMANTHA, WHY DON'T YOU SAY GOOD-BYE TO THAT LITTLE WHORE [BLEEPED] ATTITUDE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TAKING THAT IN THE CAR.
GOOD-BYE, OLD LADY WHO LISTENS TO ROCK MUSIC AND RIDES A MOTORCYCLE.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME RICHARD LINKLATER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HEY.
Jon: HERE'S ALL I'M GOING TO SAY. HERE'S ALL I'M GONG TO SAY: HOLY [BLEEPED]. THIS MOVIE IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
Jon: AND SO JUST BEAUTIFULLY MADE, 12 YEARS.
YEAH, IT'S LONG TIME SHOOT A MOVIE, YEAH.
Jon: IT'S, IT'S... HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE CAST THIS? HOW DID YOUR STAR... EXPLAIN JUST VERY BRIEFLY HOW YOU DID THIS.
I GOT SO LUCKY. YEAH, WELL, I WANTED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT GROWING UP...
Jon: YEAH.
YOU KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, MOST STORIES ABOUT KIDS, THEY JUST HAVE OH THAT SUMMER OR THAT ONE MOMENT, BUT I WANTED TO SAY THE WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW, HOW WE, HOW RELATIONSHIPS CHANGE...
Jon: RIGHT.
HOW THE SELF EMERGES, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT, SO I NEEDED A BIGGER CANVAS, YOU KNOW. I COULDN'T, YOU KNOW, SO THIS IDEA HIT ME, OH, IF WE FILMED A LITTLE BIT EVERY YEAR, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD JUST SEE EVERYONE IN ONE MOVIE JUST KIND OF GROW UP, THE ADULTS WOULD AGE, THE KIDS WOULD GROW UP, IT WOULD BE KIND OF A COOL WAY TO TELL A STORY SO HERE WE ARE.
Jon: YEAH, IT WAS. IT WAS A REALLY COOL WAY TO TELL A STORY.
SO HERE WE ARE 12 YEARS LATER.
IT'S, IT'S, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE WAY TO TELL A STORY.
AND WE GOT VERY LUCKY, LIKE YOU SAID. THE KIDS, YEAH.
Jon: DUDE, IF THIS WORKED FOR TWO YEARS STRAIGHT, THAT'S LUCK. TO HAVE THAT CONTINUITY OVER 12 YEARS, THAT, MY FRIEND, THAT'S JEDI [BLEEPED]. THAT'S, THAT'S, THAT'S THIS. AND IT'S SO INTERESTING, THE YOUNG BOY THAT YOU CAST, HOW OLD WAS HE WHEN YOU CAST HIM?
HE WAS SIX WHEN I FIRST MET HIM, SEVEN WHEN WE STARTED SHOOTING. HE'S 19 NOW. YEAH.
Jon: THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS OVER 12 YEARS.
YEAH, YEAH, IF YOU DO THE MATH, THA'S...
Jon: SO, THEY JUST FOUND OUT, WAIT, HOLD ON, MAN. YOU JUST BLEW MY MIND. [LAUGHTER] BUT HE AND THE GIRL IN THE MOVIE, WHO WAS WHAT AGE?
LORELEI WAS NINE WHEN WE STARTED.
Jon: AND YOU KNEW HER PREVIOUSLY?
YEAH, I WAS FAMILIAR WITH HER.
Jon: YES.
SHE'S MY OWN DAUGHTER.
Jon: YES, OK.
WHO I DIDN'T REALLY CAST, BY THE WAY. SHE SORT OF CAST HERSELF.
Jon: THAT IS HOW THEY WORK.
YES, SHE REALIZED THERE WAS PART FOR HER. OH, AND WELL, I'M PLAYING THAT PART, SO... THE GOOD PART ABOUT THAT IS I KNEW WHERE SHE WOULD BE EVERY YEAR. SO, SHE WOULDN'T, YOU KNOW, I COULD FIND HER, SO...
Jon: WHAT A LEAP OF FAITH, THOUGH.
YEAH.
Jon: THIS THING COULD HAVE DERAILED AT ANY MOMENT. WERE THERE CERTAIN YEARS WHERE YOU THOUGHT, MAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ONE THIS YEAR, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS JOURNEY.
NO, NO IT WAS SO PROCESS ORIENTED. IT WAS JUST SUCH A, IT WAS ACTUALLY A LUXURY TO SHOOT, EDIT AND THEN THINK FOR A YEAR. YOU KNOW, MOST MOVIES YOU'RE JUST SHOOTING AND IT'S GOING.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THIS WAS KIND OF... I WAS USING ALL THAT TIME. SO IT WAS KIND OF A LUXURY, BUT YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, THINGS COULD HAVE HAPPENED, BUT YOU HAD TO... IT WAS SORT OF A LIFE PROJECT. YOU HAD TO THINK OF IT LIKE THAT... Jon: RIGHT.
NOT WHAT WOULD GO WRONG, BUT, OH, IT WILL BE COOL TO SEE THE KIDS GROW UP AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE GOING ON IN THE CULTURE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS KIND OF FUN TO JUST COLLABORATE WITH THE UNKNOWN, YOU KNOW.
Jon: AND IT'S ALL HANDLED WITH SUCH A BEAUTIFULLY LIGHT TOUCH BECAUSE THE CULTURE SURROUNDS THE DIFFERENT MOMENTS...
YEAH.
Jon: BUT NEVER BRINGS ATTENTION TO ITSELF, SO THE... IT'S SO ORGANIC AS IT UNFOLDS THAT IT'S JOYOUS BUT HEARTBREAKING.
OH, YEAH, A LITTLE BIT, A LITTLE BIT. BUT IT WAS FUN TO BE SHOOTING LIKE A PERIOD PIECE FILM.
Jon: RIGHT.
IN THE PRESENT. YOU KNOW, SO IT'S 2002 OR 2003, BUT YOU HAD TO THINK, WHAT'S THIS GOING TO LOOK LIKE 11-12, YEARS FROM NOW, SO EVERYTHING JUST AGES, BUT, I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE EVER DONE OR WILL DO AGAIN I GUESS.
Jon: PHILOSOPHICALLY, DID THE, YOU KNOW, THE ACT OF BEING OBSERVED, FOR THE YOUNGERS ACTORS, CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR? DID IT... WERE THEY CONSCIOUS? OR?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, THIS DIDN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE A MOVIE. YOU KNOW, MOST MOVIES THERE'S A RELEASE DATE. THERE'S PRESSURE. THIS WAS JUST LIKE SUMMER CAMP MEETS A FAMILY REUNION EVERY YEAR. WE JUST GOT TOGETHER AND...
SO, EVERYONE WAS HAMMERED ON THE SET?
YEAH. YEAH. AS THEY GOT OLDER, THEY GOT HAMMERED, TOO. SO, IT WAS FUN. IT WAS FUN. BUT NO, IT WAS JUST THERE WAS NO END IN SIGHT FOR SO LONG. AND THEN IT WAS JUST, OH, YEAH, WE'RE COMING TO AN END. SO IT WAS PRETTY CASUAL.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THEY NEVER, SO I GUESS IT WAS PRETTY MIND BLOWING TO THEM WHEN THEY FINALLY SAW IT.
Jon: WHAT DID THEY, WHAT WAS THEIR REACTION?
I GAVE A DVD TO ELLER. AND I SAID, I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THIS ALONE, YOU KNOW, BUILD UP SOME KIND OF RELATION WITH THIS CRAZY THING. AND I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM FOR A WHILE, SO I WAS WORRIED, BUT, YEAH, I THINK THEY'RE STILL PROCESSING.
Jon: RIGHT. IT'S AN AWFUL LOT TO TAKE IN.
BUT... YEAH, YEAH.
Jon: AND IT'S WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING IS IT'S HARD NOT TO WATCH IT AND PROCESS YOUR OWN LIFE WITHIN IT.
YEAH. YOU HAVE TO.
Jon: WHICH, YOU KNOW, IS HOW ART WORKS THAT WAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT FAN OF YOUR FILMS, BUT IN WATCHING, THIS IT FELT LIKE WATCHING AN ARTIST AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD LEARNED OVER THE YEARS DEPLOY THAT FOR THE EFFECT OF THIS ONE BEAUTIFUL, YOU KNOW, YOU HATE TO MASTER WORK...
AW, THANKS. THANKS.
Jon: BUT, MAN, COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS 25 YEARS AGO?
NO, I WOULDN'T HAVE, I WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED. NO.
Jon: RIGHT.
I WAS INTO THE... YOU KNOW, I HAD MADE A NUMBER OF MOVIES WHEN I STARTED THIS, BUT I MADE A LOT MORE DURING IT...
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW,  BUT THIS WAS JUST ITS OWN, ITS OWN THING, YOU KNOW. SO...
Jon: WELL, I WOULD, I WOULD URGE PEOPLE TO GO SEE IT, AND OBVIOUSLY THE SEQUEL IS IN THE WORKS. [LAUGHTER]
YEAH, YEAH, WE'RE STARTING THAT. THE COLLEGE YEARS...
Jon: SURE.
AND UP TO THE FIRST DIVORCE MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW. YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S A NICE PLOT POINT TO JUST DROP IT RIGHT THERE.
YEAH, YEAH. YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT HERE.
Jon: I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU DO GET CHANCE, "BOYHOOD," IT'S PLAYING IN SELECT CITIES AND THEN IT'S GOING TO GO MUCH WIDER THIS FRIDAY AND THEN PROBABLY AROUND THE WORLD AND THEN PROBABLY THE UNIVERSE I WOULD THINK.
YEAH, I WOULD THINK SO. YEAH.
Jon: AND GO AROUND THE THING. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. CONGRATULATIONS. REALLY, REALLY AMAZING.
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. RICHARD LINKLATER.
