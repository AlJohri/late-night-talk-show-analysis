FEBRUARY 2nd, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT ONE TONIGHT, OUR GUEST TONIGHT DR. DAVID AGUS, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK, THE END OF ILLNESS. ME, BEING ABLE TO TALK TO A DOCTOR FOR FREE. (LAUGHTER) I WAS GOING KEEP HIM HERE AND HE'LL BE LIKE ARE WE STILL ON TV, YEAH, SURE  WE'RE STILL ON TV. ANYWAY, I AM GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A LITTLE CONFESSION. 1978 I KILLED A MAN DONE DR -- NO, I'M SORRY. A LITTLE CONFESSION. THE RACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING. SOME FINE DEBATE, DRAMATIC STORY LINES. BUT FOR ME, THERE'S BEEN AN EMPTINESS, SOMETHING MISSING FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW FROM  THE RACE, A MOGUL-SHAPED HOLE IN MY HEART. AND THEN THIS MORNING.
DONALD TRUMP EXPECTED TO MAKE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, JUST HOURS FROM NOW IN LAS VEGAS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THANK GOD! I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS HAPPY TO SEE AN ORANGE FACE AGAIN SINCE THE END OF FINDING THEMO. I MEAN OH! WHAT'S THE DONALD GOING TO ANNOUNCE? WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. A BACK IN THE RACE? WHAT IS HE IS A NOUNCING NOW, THAT ES RELEASING THE BIRTH BY GRADE, THAT HE IS SECEDING AND WILL RULE OVER  HIS OWN COUNTRY, AN EXACT TO SCALE REPLICA OF THIS COUNTRY MADE OF GOLD LEAF AND CONFIDENCE?
IT'S MY HONOR, REAL HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO ENDORSE MITT ROMNEY. I'VE GOT--  (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OH. THAT'S IT? (LAUGHTER) NO, LIKE, I AM-- IS GOING TO BE THE SECRETARY OF STATE, LIKE NOTHING? JUST AN ENDORSEMENT OF THE CURRENT FRONT-RUNNER AND PRESUMED NOMINEE. NEVER SAW TRUMP AS A ROMNEY GUY. AWE TRUMP AS THE GUY USE LIFESTYLE WAS DRIVEN BY A SLIGHT, A GUY LIKE ROMNEY  GAVE HIM YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, LIKE THAT PRICK THINKS CAN KEEP ME OUT OF  THE COUNTRY CLUB, I'LL BUILD MY OWN AND IT WILL HAVE A STATUE OF PERRIER COMING OUT  OF A THET-- A THENA'S NIPPLES IN IT I MEAN SERIOUSLY, WHAT WOULD TRUMP  AND ROMNEY HAVE IN COMMON. WHAT DOES TRUMP SEE WHEN HE LOOKS AT ROMNEY? ♪ DREAM WEAVER ♪ ♪.
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.
I LIKE BEING ABLE TO FAIR PEOPLE.
I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY POOR-- .
Jon: OH, THIS GUY, HE LIKES FIRING PEOPLE, HE LOVES CORPORATION, THE ONLY  THING I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT IS THE WHOLE SAME WIFE FOR 42 YEARS THING, BUT YOU KNOW, I  CAN OVERLOOK IT. SO DONE ALL TRUMP AND MITT ROMNEY JOIN FORCES SHOWING AMERICANS THAT IF TWO IVY  LEAGUE EDUCATED SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS TYCOONS FROM WEALTHY FAMILIES CAN FIND  COMMON GROUND, EVEN WHEN ONE IS A BILLIONAIRE AND THE OTHER ONLY A MULTI, MULTI, MULTIMILLIONAIRE, MAYBE THERE'S HOPE THIS COUNTRY ISN'T SO DIVIDED AFTER ALL. FOR MORE ON THE GREAT DIVIDE WE TURN TO RESIDENT DERANGED MILLIONAIRE JOHN HODGMAN, JOHN?
MONEY TALKS.
Jon: JOHN, YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME. IS THERE A SOCIOECONOMIC DIVIDE IN THIS COUNTRY?
HOW DARE YOU?
Jon: AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO BRIDGE IT.
I EXPECT THIS KIND OF CLASS WARFARE SOAK THE RICH TALK FROM HIPPIES LIKE  WARREN BUFFETT, BUT YOU ARE DIVIDING AMERICA NOW. AND NEITHER I NOR THE POLITICIANS I DONATE MONEY TO WILL STAND FOR THAT.
Jon: WE DO NOT --
WE DO NOT ACCEPT THAT OURS WILL EVER BE A NATION OF HAVEs AND HAVE NOTS. WE MUST ALWAYS BE A NATION OF AND SOON TO HAVEs.
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A NATION OF HAVEs AND SOON TO HAVE.
AMERICAS HAVE NEVER BEEN A PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THROUGH A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SAY I  HATE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THROUGH THE NICE HOUSE, THEY DRIVE THROUGH AND SAY  CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NICE HOUSE. GUESS WHAT, WE WILL BE JOINING YOU SOON.
BRAVO. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YES, WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING RICH PEOPLE LIKE MORE THAN POOR  PEOPLE CIRCLING THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AT NIGHT, SAYING WE WILL BE JOINING YOU SOON.
I SEE SARCASM, YOU SEE, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE IS THAT OUR PROSPERITY IS BLAZING A TRAIL FOR THEIR PROSPERITY. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL THAT TRAIL, JON?
Jon: THE PROSPERITY TRAIL?
WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE. WE ARE CALLING IT THE RESIDENCES AT WINDCHIME CLIFFS. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS WE HAVE NOW ARE CREATING THE EXCLUSIVE WORLD OF LUX REAL ESTATE AND  PRIVILEGE FOR THE SOON TO HAVEs TO HAVE. SOON.
Jon: BUT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. THIS SOON TO HAVEs IDEA THAT SOMEBODY 100% OF THE PEOPLE WILL GET TO BE IN THE 1% IS  MATSUZAKA KLEE IMPOSSIBLE.
NO-- IS MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
NO, JON, IT'S MATHEMATICALLY AND POSSIBLE. THINK OF CAPITALISM-- AS AN EXCITING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY WHERE THE 1% ARE  MERELY AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER FOR NOW BUT SOON YOU WILL ALL BE ASCENDING, IMAGINE THE FUN WE'LL ALL HAVE IF THE TOP OF THE LADDER WAS NOTHING BENEATH US.
Jon: IT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A PYRAMID SCHEME.
NO, IT'S NOT A PYRAMID SCHEME. A PYRAMID WAS A MONUMENT TO THE WEALTHIEST EGYPTIANS BUILT BY SLAVES WHO WORKED UNTIL THEY DIED. THAT WAB A INTERNAL METAPHOR FOR ME TO USE. FOR OUR COUNTRY TO PUT ON THE BACK OF OUR MONEY.
Jon: AGAIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE TO PUSH SO HARD THAT OH, WELL  YOU'RE GOING TO BE US TOO. IT'S THIS MYTH OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.
JON, STOP, STOP. I CAN TALK TO YOU PRIVATELY, PLEASE.
Jon: WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOW. THERE'S AN AUDIENCE, THERE'S AN AUDIENCE.
JUST HAVE THEM KILLED.
Jon: NO!, NO.
OKAY, FINE, WE'LL CONVENE UNDER MY DOME OF SILENCE. LOWER MY DOME OF SILENCE. YES. (LAUGHTER) THERE NOW, JON. NO ONE CAN HEAR US. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S TRUE, ACTUALLY.
OF COURSE THEY CAN'T HEAR US. NOW JON, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO MEAN. I KNOW YOU ARE WEALTHY Y ARE YOU ASKING.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE FAIR. IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF NOT WANTING PEOPLE TO --
I GOT IT. YOU ARE AFRAID OF A POPULAR UPRISING.
Jon: NO.
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, WHY DO YOU THINK WE CAME UP WITH ALL  THIS SOON TO AND JOB CREATOR NONSENSE. IT'S TO MAKE THESE PEOPLE THINK THAT WE ARE THEIR HEROES THEN THEY WILL BLAME  THEMSELVES FOR NOT BEING RICH. AND WE KEEP THEM IN A STATE OF CONSUMERS TORPID DEPRESSION UNTIL THEY DIE OF  TYPE II DIABETES ON A PILE OF SCRATCH OUT LOTTERY TICKETS. IT'S PERFECT. HA, HA, HA! HA, HA, HA,!, HA, HA, HA.
Jon: I THINK THE AUDIENCE CAN ACTUALLY STILL HEAR US.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING, THEY CAN'T HEAR US AT ALL. WHAT? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT PROVES NOTHING, IT'S JUST A RANDOM BOTTLE THROWING IT HAPPENS EVERY  TIME I LAUGH THAT WAY.
Jon: LOOK AT THEM NOW.
NOT TO WORRY, JON. BECAUSE I BROUGHT MY ESCAPE DOME. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS ONLY ROOM IN IT FOR ONE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ARE YOU STILL IN THE REGULAR DOME, JOHN HODGMAN, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
