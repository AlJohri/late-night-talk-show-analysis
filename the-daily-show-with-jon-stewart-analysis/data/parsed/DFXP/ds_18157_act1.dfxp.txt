SEPTEMBER 25, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY!  WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. GUESTS TONIGHT, ATOMS FOR PEACE. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] AS YOU KNOW, THAT IS A BAND AND  ALSO THE SLOGAN OF THE IRANIAN  NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THOM YORKE FROM RADIOHEAD, FLEA  FROM THE CHILI PEPPERS. VERY TALENTED GROUP. WE'VE WASTED TOO MUCH TIME. WE HAVE TO GET TO THE SENATE  FLOOR. TEXAS REPUBLICAN TED CRUZ HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THAT AUGUST BODY.
I RISE TODAY IN AN EFFORT TO  SPEAK FOR 26 MILLION TEXANS. AND FOR 300 MILLION AMERICANS. AS AMERICANS, WE VALUE LIBERTY  AND OPPORTUNITY ABOVE ALL ELSE. WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE  INTERESTED IN IS WHAT WE'VE  ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN.
Jon: STUFF-CRUSTED PIZZA. NO, WAIT!  TACOS MADE FROM DORITOS. NO. FRAPPACINO. BRANGELINA. FRAPALINA.
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN  INTERESTED IN, WHICH IS FREEDOM.
Jon: DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. DOES FREEDOM HAVE CHEESE STUFFED IN ITS CRUST? [LAUGHTER] CLEARLY SENATOR CRUZ BELIEVES  OUR FREEDOM IS UNDER ASSAULT. SENATOR CRUZ, WOULD YOU CARE TO  OFFER A HISTORICAL PRECEDENT  THAT YOU FEEL IS APPROPRIATE TO  THE THREAT THAT WE NOW FACE?
IF YOU GO TO THE 1940s, NAZI  GERMANY.
Jon: NAZI GERMANY? [LAUGHTER] WHY, THAT'S MY LEAST FAVORITE  KIND OF GERMANY. [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE YOUR REGULAR GERMANY, YOUR WEIMAR GERMANY. YOUR VISIGOTHS. YOUR HASSELHOFFS. BUT OH, MY GOD, TED CRUZ SAYS  WE'RE AT DEFCON NAZI.
WHAT WE SAW IN BRITIAN,  NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN THAT TOLD  THE BRITISH PEOPLE, ACCEPT THE  NAZIS, YES, THEY'LL DOMINATE THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE. THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. LET'S APPEASE. IN AMERICA, THERE WERE VOICES  THAT LISTENED TO THAT. I SUSPECT THOSE SAME PUNDITS THAT SAID IT COULD NOT BE DONE IF IT WAS THE 40s, WE WOULD BE  LISTENING TO THEM.
Jon: LET'S NOT LISTEN TO THE  NAZI APPEASERS. WHAT IS THIS IT THAT THESE  HITLER LOVERS BELIEVE WE CAN'T  DO BUT THAT YOU SAY WE SHOULD BE DOING? TO SAVE OUR STUFFED CRUST  FREEDOM?
I RISE TODAY IN OPPOSITION.
Jon: I RISE WITH YOU!  [LAUGHTER] TO DEFEAT WHAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME IS THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, WHICH  IS CLEARLY THE ONLY THING YOU COULD BE TALKING ABOUT GIVEN THE LEVEL OF RHETORIC YOU'VE USED THUS FAR.
IN OPPOSITION TO OBAMA CARE. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: OKAY, OKAY. POSSIBLY A VERY TROUBLED  BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM. CAN WE FOCUS ON THE NAZI ZOMBIES FOR A SECOND?
I INTEND TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT  OF DEFUNDING OBAMA CARE UNTIL I  AM NO LONGER ABLE TO STAND.
Jon: WHAT? [LAUGHTER] IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TAKE THAT  KIND OF PHYSICAL RISK. YOU HAVE GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE. [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] WOULD BE UNABLE TO STAND UNTIL  THE NAZIS STEAL MY  KNEES. YES, THAT'S TED CRUZ THE SENATOR THAT STARTED AT 2:21 EASTERN  WASTING TIME. TOOK TO THE SENATE FLOOR FOR 21 HOURS. NOT TO DELAY, BUT TO CAST  HIMSELF AS CHURCHILL TO OBAMA'S  CHAMBERLAIN IN THE GREAT FIGHT  AGAINST HITLER'S HEALTHCARE  EXCHANGES. I -- I LOST THE THREAD OF THE  METAPHOR. MY POINT IS THIS: SENATOR  CRUZ --  [LAUGHTER] TAKES AWHILE TO SINK IN. TAKES AWHILE TO SINK IN. SENATOR CRUZ CLEARLY BELIEVES  OUR VERY FREEDOM IS AT STAKE  HERE AND SENATOR CRUZ AS A  BRILLIANT HARVARD LAWYER AND  PRINCETON DEBATE CHAMPION, I  IMAGINE THAT HE IS PREPARED TO  MAKE A STUNNING ARGUMENT AS TO WHY OBAMA CARE PLACES THIS NATION IN SUCH PERIL.
SOME TIME AGO I TWEETED A  SPEECH THAT ASHTON KUTCHER GAVE. IT'S A TERRIFIC SPEECH. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU'RE [BLEEP] WITH US,  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU'RE [BLEEP] WITH US,  RIGHT? I TWEETED A SPEECH BY ASHTON  KUTCHER. IT WAS SO GOOD, I ONLY NEEDED  140 CHARACTERS OF IT. HOW WOULD THAT LOOK IN THE  SENATOR'S ORIGINAL ANALOGY? TED CRUZ!  SENATOR!  YOU'RE ONE OF THE GREAT MINDS OF OUR TIME, SAYS YOU. WHO SAYS? WE ARE FACING ONE OF THE GREAT  PERILS OF OUR AGE. AND YET YOU OUTSOURCED YOUR  ARGUMENT AND WISDOM TO A DUDE  WHO CANNOT FIND HIS CAR? [LAUGHTER] PERHAPS THERE WAS EVEN MORE  ELOQUENT AND SOARING SPEECH  MAKING TO COME.
I WANT TO POINT OUT JUST A  FEW WORDS OF WISDOM FROM "DUCK  DYNASTY." THERE WAS A MOVIE "JASON VERSUS  FREDDY." I FORGOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT  MOVIE. EIGHT WHITE CASTLE RESTAURANTS  HERE. I LIKE THEIR LITTLE BURGERS. IT'S A BIT LIKE THE WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION. IN MY MIND, I HEARD THE MUSIC  FROM THE SHINING. NOT SHINING. PSYCHO. AND JUST LIKE IN THE "STAR WARS" MOVIES, MIKE LEE, I AM YOUR FATHER!
Jon: YOU'RE LOSING THEM!  COME ON, SENATOR TED CRUZ. THIS ISN'T EVEN A FILIBUSTER. YOU HAD 20 HOURS TO MAKE YOUR  CASE. YOU'RE DOUBLE IVY LEAGUE. SURELY YOU CAN DO BETTER. MAYBE CITE A STUDY OR A BOOK.
DR. SUESS' GREEN EGGS AND  HAM. I DO NOT LIKE THEM, SAM I AM. I DO NOT LIKE GREEN EGGS AND  HAM.
Jon: SO TO EXPRESS YOUR  OPPOSITION TO OBAMA CARE, YOU GO WITH A BOOK ABOUT A STUBBORN  JERK WHO DECIDES HE HATES  SOMETHING BEFORE HE'S TRIED IT? AND WHEN HE FINALLY DOES GET A  TASTE --  [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] -- HE HAS TO ADMIT AFTER TASTING IT --
THIS IS PRETTY [BLEEP] GOOD.
Jon: SENATOR CRUZ, YOU'RE  TRYING TO SAVE AMERICA. GET TO THE DIRE FOUNDATIONAL  ISSUE AT HAND.
DO YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR? DO YOU WANT TO KEEP SEEING YOUR  DOCTOR? I'LL TELL YOU, AMERICANS ALL  OVER THIS COUNTRY ARE LOSING  THEIR HEALTHCARE BECAUSE OF  OBAMA CARE. THEY'RE LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO  SEE THEIR DOCTORS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IF THE  SENATE DOESN'T ACT TO DEFUND OBAMA CARE.
Jon: OKAY, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN OBAMACARE, AS OPPOSED TO OUR CURRENT HEALTHCARE UTOPIA WHERE DOCTOR AND PATIENT MATE FOR LIFE.
ONE HALF OF SMALL BUSINESSES  SAY THEY WILL EITHER CUT HOURS  TO REDUCE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES OR REPLACE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES WITH PART-TIME WORKERS TO AVOID THE  MANDATE. OBAMA CARE IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE  INCREASED INDIVIDUAL HEALTH  INSURANCE PREMIUMS BY ANYWHERE  FROM 64% TO 146%.
Jon: I'M NOT SAYING OBAMA  CARE IS PERFECT. IT'S NOT. IT WAS DESIGNED BY CONGRESS. NOTHING DESIGNED BY CONGRESS IS  PERFECT. YOU ASK THEM TO DESIGN A PUPPY,  YOU'D GET SOMETHING WITH NO  FACE, TWO [BLEEP] AND A  SEMIAUTOMATIC MACHINE GUN FOR A TAIL. THAT'S FINE. [LAUGHTER] TAKE THAT DOWN. THAT IS REALLY DISTURBING. DO YOU HAVE A MORE FOUNDATIONAL  CRITIQUE?
OBAMA CARE IS THE BIGGEST JOB KILLER IN THE COUNTRY. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN  HAMMERED UNDER OBAMA CARE UNLIKE EVER BEFORE. IT'S SHATTERING THE ECONOMY ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
Jon: AS OF NOW, I'M UNAWARE  OF THE SPECIFIC IMPACT ON GROWTH AND JOBS OBAMACARE HAS HAD GIVEN THAT THE SIGN UP DOESN'T START UNTIL NEXT WEEK. CLEARLY ECONOMIC GROWTH IS AN  IMPORTANT ISSUE AND SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU THAT JUST THE POSSIBILITY THAT OBAMA  CARE MAY BE HURTING THE ECONOMY  IS ENOUGH TO GET YOU ON YOUR  FEET FOR 21 HOURS. I CONGRATULATE YOU ON THAT, SIR. BUT I CAN THINK OF ANOTHER  THING THAT CAME OUT OF  WASHINGTON RECENTLY THAT IS  HURTING ECONOMIC GROWTH RIGHT  NOW. ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL  BUDGET OFFICE, THE SPENDING CUTS FROM THE SEQUESTER ARE COSTING  THE COUNTRY 3 QUARTERS OF A MILLION JOBS THIS YEAR ALONE. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THOSE  CUTS?
WE STOOD OUR GROUND AND  FINALLY GOT AT LEAST THE FIRST  SMALL STEP, AND I UNDERSCORE  IT'S A SMALL STEP, TO REIGNING  IN OUR UNCONTROLLABLE SPENDING  AND DEBT.
Jon: OH!  SO THAT SLOWDOWN FOR ECONOMIC  GROWTH IS GOOD? YOU KNOW WHO ELSE THOUGHT REINING IN UNCONTROLLABLE DEBT AND SPENDING WAS A GOOD IDEA? HITLER. [LAUGHTER] SO YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE  SEQUESTER IS THAT IT DIDN'T COST US ENOUGH JOBS. FOR ALL ITS FLAWS, OBAMA CARE  APPEARS TO BE AT LEAST  ATTEMPTING TO FIX SOME HOLES IN  OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. LIKE INSURANCE COMPANIES DENYING COVERAGE BASED ON PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO REPEAL IT, HAVE SOME IDEA OF YOUR OWN HOW  TO DO THAT. PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT?
MY VIEW ON PRE-EXISTING  CONDITIONS IS WE OUGHT TO REFORM THE MARKET TO DEAL WITH THAT  PROBLEM. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO YOU GOT NOTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT, TED CRUZ? THE LEVEL OF THREAT YOU SAY WE  FACE FROM OBAMA CARE ISN'T MET  BY THE QUALITY OF SOLUTION AND  THE RHETORIC THAT YOU OFFER. REMINDS ME OF A CHARACTER I  ONCE READ ABOUT BY I BELIEVE ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE AUTHORS,  DR. SUESS, HIS BELOVED  CHILDREN'S BOOK, THE BORE-AX. JOIN ME NOW AS I READ A FAVORITE SECTION. [LAUGHTER] IN THE LAND OF D.C. AND THE  SENATE OF SNOOZE, LIVE THE SHOW  BODIUS BLAB WHOSE NAME WAS TED  CRUZ. TED TALKED ABOUT HEALTHCARE,  COMPARED IT TO NAZIS. AS COMPARISONS GO, HE WAS OFF BY A LOTSY. [LAUGHTER] HEALTHCARE, HE SAID, WOULD END  THIS GREAT NATION. A POINT MADE AFTER HOURS OF  MOUTH MASTURBATION. [APPLAUSE] REPEAL IT, DEFUND IT, ERASE IT,  DENY IT, MURDER IT, [BLEEP] IT  AND BREAD AND DEEP FRY IT!  [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS WEIRD. FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK AUTHOR. CRUZ CLAIMS FREEDOM AND LIBERTY, BUT IT WAS ALL A BIG SHOW  BECAUSE HE COULD HAVE SPEND ALL  THAT TIME MAKING SURE THE LAW  DIDN'T BLOW. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
