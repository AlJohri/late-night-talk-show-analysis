SEPTEMBER 6, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS  "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART! MAN, HAVE WE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE'RE BACK, BABY! OUR GUEST TONIGHT, BUDDY ROEMER. BUDDY ROEMER, FORMER CONGRESSMAN, ARGUABLY AMERICA'S FOURTH MOST FAMOUS BUDDY, I BELIEVE. EBSEN, HACKETT, HOLLY, ROEMER, WHO THE HELL KNOWS? WE ARE BACK, BABY. NICE BREAK. IN JERSEY WE HAD A LITTLE EARTHQUAKE, LITTLE HURRICANE. YESTERDAY YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT WE WERE ATTACKED BY FERAL LEPRECHAUNS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, EVERY AUGUST? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I SPENT THE WHOLE VACATION JUST KIND OF HUDDLED IN A CELT WE ARE CONDENSED MILK AND A BOWL OF  FRUITY PEBBLES AND JUST... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THE FRUITY PEBBLES YOU CAN JUST  USE THEM... (LAUGHTER). ... TO FILL SANDBAGS. BECAUSE THAT (BLEEP), TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. IMPERVIOUS TO MOISTURE. (LAUGHTER) MADE OF REAL COLORED STYROFOAM. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE ARE BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHERE DID WE... LET ME E ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHERE DID WE LEAVE OFF? WHERE DID WE...
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ASKING THE QUESTION WHEREBY THE JOBS?
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON JOBS.
WHERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE WE FACE, EXPANDING THE ECONOMY AND CREATING JOBS.
WHERE ISJOBS.
Jon: I AM SO CONCERNED ABOUT JOBS THAT I LEFT MY JOB TO RUN FOR OFFICE TO CREATE JOBS  FOR OTHER... (LAUGHTER). I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID THAT! NOW, SOMEONE ELSE CAN TAKE MY OLD JOB, I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME  OTHER GUY'S JOB AND THAT GUY CAN GO (BLEEP) HIMSELF. (LAUGHTER) GOOD NEWS, THOUGH. PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED THAT ON THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS BACK IN SESSION  HE WOULD GIVE A SPEECH TO BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS ON THE VERY PRESSING TOPIC OF JOBS.
THERE'S A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AT THE SAME TIME HE WANTED TO SPEAK.
Jon: DAMN! (LAUGHTER) A REPUBLICAN DEBATE THE VERY SAME NIGHT THE PRESIDENT WISHES TO SPEAK ABOUT JOBS. I KNOW WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO. LOGGERHEADS, BATTLES, CONFLICT, GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, ESCALATION OF RHETORIC, RACE WAR, FERRELL LEPRECHAUNS ROAMING THE STREETS. WE'RE DOOMED!
WEDNESDAY SEEMED TO BE THE BEST OPTION, WHEN THAT WASN'T  AVAILABLE... WHEN THAT SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM, THURSDAY WAS FINE WITH US. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE PRESIDENT OFFERED A DATE, THE REPUBLICANS SAID "COULD YOU MOVE THAT A DAY?" AND THE PRESIDENT SAID "ALL  RIGHT." (LAUGHTER) NONCRISIS AVERTED. IT'S THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF WHAT I HOPE WILL BE MANY IN OUR  NEW SEGMENT "TALES OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION." I TELL YOU, IT'S NICE TO SEE  THAT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN. PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE A MINOR...
THE ONE DAY CONTROVERSY KNOWN AS SPEECH-GATE.
WHERE IS SPEECH-GATE.
WHERE IS DEBATE-GATE.
WHERE IS HOW CAN OUR POLITICAL LEADERS DO BIG THINGS LIKE REDUCE THE DEBT OR FIX THE  ECONOMY IF THEY BUTT HEADS OVER A SCHEDULING SPEECH.
Jon: ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING INSANE? (LAUGHTER) "HOW CAN AMERICANS TRUST THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS NOT TO SNEAK  INTO THEIR HOUSES AND KILL THEM IN THEIR SLEEP WHEN IT TOOK THEM 24 WHOLE HOURS TO DO A SCHEDULE  RETHINGY." SEE, THIS IS WHY I HATE THE 24-HOUR NEWS NETWORKS. WELL, AMONG THE REASONS I HATE THEM. THEY'VE TURNED OUR TALE OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION INTO TALE OF MANUFACTURED CONTROVERSY. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT THE CONFLICT, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT  THE RESOLUTION.
WHERE IS DID HE LOSE THIS ROUND?
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS CAVED.
HE ALSO APPEARS PARTISAN BECAUSE DID HE SCHEDULE THE BIG SPEECH ON PURPOSE TO TAKE PLACE  ON THE VERY SAME DAY A REPUBLICAN DEBATE WAS BROADCAST?
IT SYMBOLICALLY BECAME A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.
WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT HAS CAVED.
Jon: THE PRESIDENT PUT ON HIS FOOTY PAJAMAS. (LAUGHTER) DIPPED HIS PACIFIER IN BRANDY AND CURLED UP SMALLER AND SMALLER UNTIL HE FOUND HIMSELF  NESTLED INSIDE HIS OWN BALLS. (LAUGHTER) LIKE A SET OF RUSSIAN TESTICLE DOLLS. BUT, ALL RIGHT, FINE. YOU CAN EXPECT THE CABLE NEWS BLOW HARDS TO FOCUS ON THE SIDESHOW. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS, TO GET TO THE REAL SUBSTANCE.
WHERE IS HOW HAS THE PRESIDENT REACTED TO THE WHOLE DEBATE YESTERDAY OVER THE ISSUES  OVER THE SCHEDULING OF THE SPEECH?
THERE'S A PERCEPTION EVEN AMONG DEMOCRATS THAT HE DOESN'T  HAVE ENOUGH CLOUT WITH THE HILL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DAY IT IS. HOW IS HE GOING TO PASS A PLAN TO HELP THE AMERICAN THEM?
IS THERE ANYTHING THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.
HOW CAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT HE CAN DO SOMETHING MUCH MORE DIFFICULT?
DID THE PRESIDENT GIVE IN OR CAPITULATE.
WHERE IS DOES THIS HAVE TO BE FIXED.
WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT CAN'T GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS CONGRESS.
WHERE IS THIS COMMUNICATED...
IS THIS THE PLAN ALL ALONG.
WHERE IS HE SAID, ALL RIGHT, FINE, WE'LL DO IT ON THURSDAY. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: THERE WERE 23 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHEDULING OF THE SPEECH. NINE ABOUT ITS CONTENT. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 P.M. EASTERN  STANDARD TIME WE'RE READY TO CALL IT THE INCUMBENT STYLE THUMPS SUBSTANCE 72% TO 28%. WALTER MONDALE LAUGHED AT HOW POORLY SUBSTANCE DID. I'M SURE SUBSTANCE WILL CONCEDE AT SOME POINT, BUT WHO GIVES A (BLEEP)? FOR MORE ON "HOW DOES WEDNESDAY WORK? NOT GREAT? OKAY, HOW ABOUT THURSDAY-GATE" I'M JOINED BY SENIOR WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER. JOHN, I DON'T SEE WHAT THIS IS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IN ANY WAY.
WHAT?
I DON'T ZEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS ABOUT ANY OF THIS.
OH, REALLY? REALLY, YOU DON'T SEE IT, JON? A PRESIDENTIAL SPEECH AND A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ON THE SAME NIGHT? YOU ARE FORCING AMERICA INTO A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. ON ONE CHANNEL IS THE PRESIDENT USING A JOINT SESSION TO UNVEIL A PLAN WHICH REALISTICALLY CAN  DO LITTLE TO DIMINISH AMERICA'S SOARING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES WHILE  AT THE VERY SAME TIME A HANDFUL OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ABOUT  WHOM THEIR OWN PARTY CAN'T EVEN GET EXCITED WILL COMPETITIVELY PANDER TO A SMALL BUT VOCAL  COLLECTION OF ELDERLY LUNATICS. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU CAN ONLY WATCH ONE OF THOSE, JON. (LAUGHTER) JUST ONE.
Jon: IT'S NOT EXACT I "SOPHIE'S CHOICE."
OF COURSE IT'S NOT, SOPHIE HAD IT EASY. (LAUGHTER) YOU OBVIOUSLY GO WITH BOY. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WHO CHOOSES TO SAVE THE GIRL FROM THE NAZIS? SHE'S WEAK, SHE'LL NEVER SURVIVE THE POLISH WINTER. (LAUGHTER) IT'S EASY. IT'S A NO BRAINER FOR SOPHIE.
Jon: WHO WOULD CHOICE THAT?
WHO WOULD CHOICE IT?
Jon: WHO WOULD CHOICE IT? WHO CAN CHOICE?
WHO CAN CHOICE BUT SOPHIE.
Jon: PECK STOP TAKING AND CUT OUT THAT BECAUSE YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.
NO, WRONG, JON, I STAND BY IT. IN FACT, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN IN CASE YOU EDIT IT OUT. SOPHIE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE BOY. THE BOY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, PLEASE. PLEASE. LET'S GET BACK TO... YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIG PROBLEM IF BOTH THINGS  HAPPENED THE SAME NIGHT?
HUGE, JON. AND THE PUBLIC CONUNDRUM WOULD HAVEN'T ENDED THERE. THEY STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF MISSING BOTH POLITICAL EVENTS AND WATCHING "GHOSTS CAUGHT ON  CAPE" ON THE BIOGRAPHY CHANNEL. THEY'RE GHOSTS, JON! AND THEY'RE CAUGHT ON TAPE! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BUT EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT HADN'T SWITCHED THE  DATES COULDN'T PEACH WATCH ONE THING AND RECORD THE OTHER?
SURE, THEN YOU CAN PULL A RABBIT OUT OF YOUR MAGIC TELEVISION BEFORE DRIVING YOUR  FLYING CAR TO YOUR HOTEL ON THE MOON. DON'T FORGET TO BREAK FOR UNICORNS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SCIENCE FICTION/FANTASY. (LAUGHTER) RIGHT? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I'M... LIKE TIVO, D.V.R., YOU CAN... EVERYONE HAS ONE.
THAT IS TRUE. BUT WHO'S GOING TO WATCH THE SPEECH OR THE DEBATE WHEN THEY'VE GOT ALL THE SHOWS THEY  ACTUALLY LIKE RIGHT AT THEIR FINGERTIPS? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHAT'S WITH ALL THE GHOST SHOWS? WHY IS...
I LOVE GHOSTS, JON! YOU THINK POLITICS IS THE ONLY THING I'M INTERESTED IN? I'M A GHOST GUY! THEY'RE MY THING.
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EVERYBODY.
WHERE IS HEY, WHOA, WHOA, DID YOU JUST FEEL A COLD WIND? I THINK THERE'S A GHOST IN HERE! QUICK, CATCH IT ON TAPE! HOLD MY HAND!
Jon: JOHN OLIVER, EV
