FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLA    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY  SHOW."  I'M JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART, JON STEWART, I'M  AFRAID, IS STILL NOT HERE. WORD IS THAT HE HAS BEEN  KIDNAPPED AND TRAPPED IN A CAVE  IN THE MIDDLE EAST CONSTRUCTING HIS OWN IRON MAN SUIT. ( LAUGHTER )  OUR GUEST TONIGHT, CURRENTLY  HEAD COACH OF THE EGYPTIAN  NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM, BOB BRADLEY WILL BE WITH US AND  AMAZING STORIES, AMAZING STORIES  TO TELL. LET'S START TONIGHT, THOUGH  WNEWS FROM THE GAME MONOPOLY,  WHERE BIG CHANGES ARE AFOOT.
THEY'RE TAKING THE JAIL OUT  OF THE MONOPOLY GAME.
BOOO!
John: YOU HEARD RIGHT. THE GAME DESIGNED TO TEACH  CHILDREN HOW CAPITALISM WORK HAS  REMOVED THE "GO TO JAIL" OPTION TO REFLECT THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM  THEY'RE GOING TO GROW UP IN,  PRESUMABLY REPLACING IT WITH A "GET IDEAL AT BY CONGRESS AND  THEN GO DIRECTLY TO THE CAYMEN  ISLANDS" OPTION. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  ALSO, ALSO THIS WEEK, WE  ACTUALLY HAVE NEWS FROM THE REAL FINANCIAL SECTOR.
THE BIG STORY THIS QUARTER  HAS BEEN FINANCIAL STOCKS, THE  BANK STOCKS ALL HAD SPECTACULAR  NUMBERS. HERE'S GOLDMAN SACHS, BY THE  WAY, WHICH HAD AN ABSOLUTELY  TERRIFIC EARNINGS REPORT.
PROFITS DOUBLE AT GOLDMAN  SACHS IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO  $1.93 BILLION.
John: YES, GOLDMAN SACHS  HAVE BEEN COVERING THEIR  INVESTORS IN GOLDMAN SHOWERS. AS AN INTERESTING SIDENOTE HERE,  ONE OF THE REASONSES THAT  GOLDMAN IS DOING SO WELL IS ITS TRADE IN ALUMINUM. AS OF I WILL INCORRECTLY  PRONOUNCE IT FOR YOUR COMFORT,  ALUMINUM. FOR YEARS, ALUMINUM HAS HELPED  BUILD OUR AIRPLANES. IT'S KEPT US FROM SIPPING BEER  OUT OF OUR HANDS. AND PROVIDED MUCH-NEEDED  HEADGEAR FOR OUR CRAZY PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT WALL STREET'S DARLING HAS  WORKED OUT THAT THERE IS GOLD IN  THAT THERE ALUMINUM.
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TIMES  A DAY, THIRSTY AMERICANS OPEN A  CAN OF SODA, BEER, OR JEES EXPEMP TIME THEY DO IT, THEY PAY  A FRACTION OF A PENNY MORE  BECAUSEAVE SHREWD MANEUVER BY GOLDMAN SACHS.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES"  REPORTING OVER THE WEEKEND THAT  GOLDMAN SACHS IS RUNNING A SCHEME TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE  ALUMINUM PRICES.
John: THAT SCHEME-- TO  MARRY AN ELDERLY ALUMINUM  HEIRESS AND MURDER HER FOR HER  MONEY. SO GOLDMAN SACHS IS RUNNING THE  CLASSIC REYNOLD WRAP GRIST ON  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER  INSTALLMENT OF JOHN OLIVER'S  DETAILS OF FOREIGN METAL PRICING  UPDATE. WAIT, WAIT! DON'T CHANGE THE CHANNEL! I PROMISE THIS STORY IS WORTH  LISTENING TO. MAYBE WE CAN JUST JUICE UP THE  OPENING A BIT.  ♪ ♪ ♪
JOHN OLIVER'S ARCANE DETAILS  OF BORON GROUP METAL PRICING  UPDATE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: HEAVY METAL WHAT, IS  TECHNICALLY CLASSED AS LIGHT  METAL. AHHH! NO, SAX HAS TWO-- GOLDMAN SACHS  HAS TWO SEPARATE VENTURES IN  ALUMINUM. HAD OANS WAREHOUSE WHERE  ALUMINUM IS STORED AND ALSO  TRADES ALUMINUM. SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT  HAPPENS NEXT.
THE REPORT CLAIMS GOLDMAN'S  WAREHOUSE CREATES BOTTLENECKS,  LENGTHENING DELIVERY TIMES. THE BANK PROFIT FROM EXTENDED  RENT AND BETS MADE ON THE FUTURE  OF THOSE METALS BY THEIR TRADING  ARM.
John: SO LET'S GET THIS  CLEAR-- IF THESE REPORTS ARE  RIGHT, GOLDMAN CAN BET ON THE FUTURE PRICE OF ALUMINUM WHILE  SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVING THE  ABILITY TO GOOSE THE FUTURE PRICE OF ALUMINUM IF THAT'S  SOMETHING THEY FIND INTERESTING  AND/OR PROFITABLE. ( LAUGHTER )  IN THE STOCK MARKET, THAT'S  WHAT'S KNOWN AS INSIDER TRADING. IN THE COMMODITIES MARKET,  THAT'S KNOWN AS SIMPLY THURSDAY. OR MONDAY OR TUESDAY, FRIDAY, OR  WEDNESDAY. ( LAUGHTER )  SO HOW MUCH IS THIS SCHEME  COSTING THE AMERICAN CITIZEN?
THE BEER INSTITUTE ESTIMATING  THE HIGHER PREMIUMS CAUSED BY  THE BOTTLENECKS COST THEM AN ADDITIONAL $3.6 BILLION EACH  YEAR.
John: WAIT, FIRST THINGS  FIRST-- THERE'S A BEER  INSTITUTE? ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
John: THAT'S A PARTY STORE  RIGHT THERE. I ASSUME THEIR MASCOT IS THE  FIGHTING BLAAH. SO GOLDMAN SACHS IS MAKING US  PAY BILLIONS MORE FOR ALUMINUM  CANS AND PROFITING OFF THE BACK OF THAT, THAT MAKES HE SO MAD. I THINK I NEED A COLD DRINK. OH, I'M PLAYING INTO THEIR TRAP! EVERY TIME I USE A CAN, I MAKE  THEM MONEY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE GOT TO CALL MY ACCOUNTANT. HELLO, BEAR? OH, NO! DIIT AGAIN! GET A PHONE, BARRY! NOW, YOU MIGHT BE THINKING  SURELY THERE IS A RULE IN PLACE  TO PREVENT ALUMINUM HORDING. WELL, RELAX, THERE ACTUALLY IS. THE RULES STATE 3,000 TONS MUST  LEAVE THE WAREHOUSE EACH DAY. HOWEVER, THAT LEAVES A LOOPHOLE  BIG ENOUGH TO DRIVE SEVERAL  LIEWM-LADEN TRUCK THROUGHS.
ON A DAILY BASIS A FLEET OF  TRUCKS MOVE THE ALUMINUM AROUND  AND AROUND FROM ONE WAREHOUSE TO  ANOTHER. A FORKLIFT DRIVER CALLS IT "A  MERRY-GO-ROUND OF METAL."
"A MERRY-GO-ROUND OF METAL. COINCIDENTALLY, THE MOST POPULAR  RIDE AT HURTSY PARK AND FAMILY  FUN ZONE. AND THE TRUCK DRIVERS AT THOSE  WAREHOUSES SEEMS TO REALIZE HOW  RIDICULOUS THIS SCHEME IS WITH ONE WORKER SAYING HE WOULD JOKE  WITH HIS NEPHEW AT ANOTHER  WAREHOUSE ASKING, "DID YOU GET ALL THAT METAL WE SENT YOU?"  TO WHICH HIS NEPHEW REPLIED,  "YUP. DID YOU GET ALL THE STUFF WE  SENT YOU."  IT ALL SOUNDS LIKE FUN AND GAMES  BUT I BET YOU THERE'S A DISILLUSIONED ALUMINUM  DELIVERYMAN SAYING I GOT INTO  THIS BUSINESS TO BRING ALUMINUM TO THE PEOPLE, MAN. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE  DOING ANYMORE. ( LAUGHTER )  THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THERE  USED TO BE RULES PREVENT, BANKS  FROM CONTROLLING PHYSICAL GOODS SO THAT THEY COULDN'T MANIPULATE  PRICES FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT. BUT, LIKE MARILU HENNER, THOSE  RULES PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEARED  SOME TIME IN THE 1990s. BUT THIS IS STILL ENOUGH OF AN  ISSUE THAT ON TUESDAY, AS MANY  AS FOUR, MAYBE EVEN FIVE MEMBERS OF THE 50-MEMBER SENATE BANKING  SUBCOMMITTEE GATHERED TO HEAR  TESTIMONY ON THE MATTER.
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN  BANKING AND COMMODITIES IS NOT A  NEW DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS VERY ANCIENT ROOTS. PHYSICAL COMMODITIES SUCH AS  GRAND AND SALT WERE AMONG THE  FIRST FORMS OF MONEY IN ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA, EGYPT, CHINA. ( LAUGHTER ).
John: YES, BUT THEN, THEY  INVENTED MONEY. ( LAUGHTER )  BY THE WAY, IF YOUR EXCUSE FOR  SERVING, "WELL, HAMARABI DID  IT," THEN I THINK YOU'RE ON SHAKY GROUND. DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? ( APPLAUSE )  NOW THE COUNTER-POINT OF THE  ARGUMENT IS THIS--
JUST BECAUSE SOME BANKS  SOMEWHERE IN THE PAST DID  SOMETHING AND IT WAS OKAY, DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT  IT'S OKAY TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE, I AM SURE THAT  SOMESOMETIMES SOME BANK HAS  AMPHIBIOUSED SLAVE TRADE, RIGHT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN J.P. MORGAN  TODAY SHOULD BE FINANCING HUMAN  TRAFFICKING.
John: THAT'S A FAIR POINT. IT'S A FAIR POINT. I GET IT. THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW THAT  SOMEONE AT J.P. MORGAN JUST SAW  THAT AND WENT, "WAIT. WE WERE NOT FINANCING HUMAN  RAFFICKING? ?"T  HAVE YOU SEEN THE PROFIT MARGINS  ON ROMANIAN SEX SLAVES? THEY'RE RIGHT. I HAVE TO GET INTO THIS MYSELF. BARRY, BARRY! BUY! HOW IS THIS LINE BUSY, BARRY! HOLD OI'LL USE MY CELL. BARRY! BARRY! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  GOOD LUCK. GOOD LUCK FINDING A STUPIDER  ALUMINUM CAN-BASED JOKE ANYWHERE  ON TELEVISION THIS EVENING. ( LAUGHTER )  IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE,  THIS SEEMS PRETTY OBJECTIVELY  OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR. OR IF YOU WORK FOR A MAJOR  FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK--
I WANT TO TELL THAT YOU I DID  NOT UNDERSTAND THAT STORY. OKAY, I READ IT THREE TIMES. I HAD MY PRODUCER, WHO IS VERY  FINANCIALLY LITERATE, READ IT  THREE TIMES. I DON'T QUITE GET THE SCAM. I READ THAT STORY HOW MANY  TIMESES? I READ IT FIVE TIMES. SOMEHOW THEY MANIPULATED THE  PRICE OF ALUMINUM. I DON'T KNOW HOW.
John: HOW DO YOU NOT GET  IT! YOU'RE A FINANCIAL EXPERT  SEEMINGLY FLUMMOXED BY THE  EASIEST FINANCIAL STORY IN A  DECADE. THIS IS SOMETHING A CHILD COULD  UNDERSTAND. IN FACT, I'LL SHOW YOU. ELLIOT, ELLIOT. COME IN HERE, ELLIOT. ELLIOT.
YES? ( APPLAUSE )
John: ELLIOT.
YES?
John: DID YOU READ THAT  STORY ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS?
YES. THEY'RE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING  PRICES THROUGH STORAGE.
John: JUST TO BE CLEAR,  ELLIOT, YOU UNDERSTOOD IT.
OBVIOUSLY, I'M EIGHT AND A  HALF.
John: RIGHT, RIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ANYTHING ELSE?
WHAT GOLDMAN SACHS IS DOING  IS WORSE THAN COOTIES.
John: IT IS WORSE THAN  COOTIES, ELLIOT. THANK YOU, ELLIOT.
BY THE WAY, WHEN IS JOHN  COMING BACK.
John: JON STEWART IS COMING  BACK IN A FEW WEEKS.
OH, THANK GOD. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
John: I'VE GOT--  ( LAUGHTER )  SHE'S JUST SAYING WHAT AMERICA  IS THINKING. RELAX. I'VE GOT TO SAY, NOW THAT YOU  THINK ABOUT IT, THE NEW VERSION  OF MONOPOLY IS ACTUALLY PERFECT. YOU JUST MOVE PIECES OF METAL  AROUND AND AROUND IN A CIRCLE,  COLLECTING MONEY WHENEVER YOU WANT, AND IT'S GUARANTEED THAT  NOBODY IS GOING TO JAIL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
