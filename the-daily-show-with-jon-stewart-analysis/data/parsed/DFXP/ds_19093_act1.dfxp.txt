FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST ROBIN ROBERTS. AS ALWAYS BEFORE THE SHOW I'M JUST SCRIBBLING THE PHRASE "NI HAO" FOR NO APPARENT REASON. BUT FIRST, THERE'S NOT MUCH IN THE WORLD I TRULY LOVE IN THIS WORLD, MY FAMILY, MY COUNTRY, MY PRICELESS COLLECTION OF ANTIQUE CERAMIC CATS. HELLO MORRIS AND MORRIS. BUT ABOVE ALL MY HEART BELONGS TO MY BELOVED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WHEN I TUNED INTO HIS PROGRAM LAST NIGHT, AS I DO EVERY NIGHT -- [LAUGHTER] -- IT WAS KIND OF A GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS SITUATION.
TONIGHT I'M TAKING ON THE EVER SO FUNNY JON STEWART OF THE "THE DAILY SHOW". STEWART AND HIS FRIENDS AT COMEDY CENTRAL, THEY ARE THE CHIEF APOLOGISTS FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. HE DOES SUCK UP A LOT. YOU KNOW THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, I GUESS, I CAN'T EXPECT A COMEDIC HACK AND HIS ARMY OF WRITERS, I CAN'T TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY.
Jon: OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD. WAIT! WAIT. WAIT WAIT. JUST WAIT. SEAN HANNITY KNOWS MY NAME. [ LAUGHTER ] I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, THE HACK THING HURTS A LITTLE, BUT THE WOUND IS HEALED BY THE OINTMENT OF YOUR ATTENTION. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED WAS, [LAUGHTER] SEAN THERE, WELL, HE WAS UPSET THAT ON MONDAY I MAY HAVE MENTIONED THAT HE WAS BEING HYPOCRITICAL IN DEFENDING THE NEVADA RANCHER AND MILITANT FEDERAL GRAZING FEE NOT PAYER CLIVEN BUNDY. I AM SYMPATHETIC TO CRITICS OF EMINENT DOMAIN AND THOSE WHO FEEL THAT OBAMA'S JACK BOOTED THUGS SHOULD NEVER HAVE SIGNED THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER EXTENDING THOSE FEDERAL GRAZING FEES INDEFINITELY. I'M SORRY, DID I SAY OBAMA? I MEANT RONALD REAGAN. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S BESIDES THE THE POINT. OF COURSE, ACCORDING TO HANNITY HIS SUPPORT OF CLIVEN ISN'T EVEN ABOUT RULE OF LAW.
CAN I MAKE MY POSITION MORE CLEAR TO MR. STEWART?  I STAND FOR PROPORTIONALITY. I THOUGHT THERE WAS A LACK OF PROPORTIONALITY HERE BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND SNIPERS IN SURROUNDING YOUR RANCH AND TAKING YOUR CATTLE.
Jon: IT'S PROPORTIONALITY HE IS UPSET ABOUT. PORTION CONTROL. THE GOVERNMENT IS OVERREACTING WHICH THEY TEND TO DO WHEN 20 YEARS OF ATTEMPTS TO COLLECT MONEY INCLUDING FOUR SEPARATE COURT JUDGMENTS ARE IGNORED AND THE OWER MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED HE HAS WEAPONS AND IS VOWING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES WITH HIS WIFE ADDING THAT SHE HAS A LOADED SHOTGUN AND IS READY TO DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. I'M SURE THE GOVERNMENT IF THEY TRIED ONE MORE TIME SENT A COUPLE MORE GUYS UP THERE WITH A SWISS ARMY KNIFE AND ONE OF THOSE CREDIT CARD SWIPERS, I'M SURE WE COULD SETTLE THIS REASONABLY. BECAUSE SEAN HANNITY IS FOR PROPORTIONALITY WHEN DEALING WITH DISSENT. LIKE WHEN A POLICE OFFICER GENERALLY SEASONED NONVIOLENT PROTESTERS AT UC DAVIS.
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, THAT'S A LOT OF PEPPER SPRAY.
IT WAS A LOT OF PEPPER SPRAY.
DID THEY CROSS THE LINE? I DON'T THINK SO. [AUDIENCE BOOS]
Jon: NO, THAT WAS PROPORTIONAL. IN FACT, THEY COULDN'T HAVE CROSSED THE LINE BECAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN SEE A LINE BECAUSE MY (bleep) EYES WERE BURNING BECAUSE I HAD JUST HAD A PEPPER SPRAY SHOWER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO THAT -- THAT IS A RESPONSIBLE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY. I MEAN THOSE PEOPLE WERE CLEARLY THERE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH I BELIEVE IS PROVOCATION ENOUGH. THE PROTESTERS WERE IN POSSESSION OF BUTTS WITH INTENT TO SIT. SO THAT SRIRACHA BOUCHACHI WAS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. SRIRACHA, BY THE WAY, TRADEMARK PHRASE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT WHAT ABOUT STOP AND FRISK? THE RANDOM SEARCH AND SEIZURE BASED PURELY ON APPEARANCE? IS THAT PROPORTIONAL OR AUTHORITY OVERREACH?
OFFICIALS HAVE CITED THE POLICE TACTIC AS BEING INSTRUMENTAL IN REDUCING MAJOR CRIME IN THE BIG APPLE. AS SOON AS THEY STARTED IT, MURDER RATES, CRIME WENT DOWN.
BUT JUST TO SAY SOMEONE IS SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK AND BROWN. THAT'S NOT FAIR.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TIE THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
Jon: AH! CAN'T TIE THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SEAN HANNITY WILL NOT ALLOW THIS NATION'S LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED WHEN THEY NEED THEM TO FRISK THE BROWN PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] BROWN COWS, ON THE OTHER HAND -- [LAUGHTER] HAVE CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. BUT ANYWAY THAT'S WHEN (bleep) GOT WEIRD.
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT JON STEWART HAD A QUOTE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY. HE INVITED ALL OF HIS FRIENDS TO ATTEND INCLUDING THIS SINGER. REMEMBER CAT STEVENS. HE HAS SINCE CHANGED HIS NAME TO YUSUF ISLAM. THERE'S ONE PROBLEM WITH INVITING MR. ISLAM TO A RALLY AIMED AT RESTORING SANITY, OH THAT'S THE SAME ISLAM WHO INFAMOUSLY IS UNAPOLOGETIC FOR ENDORSING A FATWA MEANING "TO KILL" A NOVELIST BY THE NAME OF SALMAN RUSHDIE.
Jon: AH, POINT TAKEN ON THAT ONE. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT ONE. SEE, I WANTED HIM TO PLAY PEACE TRAIN SO THAT OZZY OSBOURNE COULD CUT HIM OFF WITH CRAZY TRAIN AND THEN THE O'JAYS COME IN AND THEY END IT WITH LOVE TRAIN. IT WAS A GOOD BIT. [ LAUGHTER ] HAD ONE SMALL FLAW -- THE FATWA GUY, BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW FEW NON-FATWA MUSICIANS HAVE DONE TRAIN BASED SONGS AND WERE AVAILABLE THAT WEEKEND. BUT CORRECT, CORRECT MR. HANNITY, MISTAKE. I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED INTO IT MORE. IT SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, I'M JUST NOT SURE YOU ARE THE BEST GUY TO MAKE THE GUILT BY MUSICIAN ASSOCIATION POINT.
OBAMA, HE'S A PIECE OF (bleep). AND I TOLD HIM TO SUCK ON MY MACHINE GUN. I SAID HEY HILLARY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO RIDE ONE OF THESE INTO THE SUNSET, YOU WORTHLESS (bleep).
THAT WAS FRIEND AND FREQUENT GUEST ON THE PROGRAM TED NUGENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: NOW BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE CAT STEVENS FATWA THING WHEN WE BOOKED HIM BUT YOU LITERALLY WENT FROM A TAPE OF TED NUGENT SAYING THAT (bleep) TO THAT WAS FRIEND OF SHOW TED NUGENT. I WILL SAY THIS, THOUGH, FOR ALL THE DISINGENUOUS, HYPOCRITICAL, NONFACTUAL CORROSIVE, HACKEY WORD TERDS THAT YOU SPEAK -- [LAUGHTER] -- YOU DID GET ONE THING RIGHT.
STEWART WENT INTO HIS TAPE ARSENAL WHICH BY THE WAY SERVE AS AS MORE PROOF. REMEMBER HE WAS BEGGING ME TO STAY IN NEW YORK, HE IS KIND OF OBSESSED WITH THIS PROGRAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM OBSESSED. I AM OBSESSED WITH YOUR PROGRAM. YOU CAN SAY TRUE THINGS. I AM  OBSESSED WITH YOUR PROGRAM IN THE SAME WAY I AM OBSESSED WITH ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT SUPERBUGS OR THE PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH OR THE KFC DOUBLE DOWN BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IN THIS DAY IN AGE WITH ALL THAT WE KNOW THIS (bleep) IS OUT THERE. THAT HUMANITY -- HUMANITY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- THAT OUR SOCIETY IS STILL WEIGHED DOWN BY THESE BURDENS OF A SEEMINGLY MORE MEDIEVAL TIME, LIKE YOUR SHOW. TO SEE IT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT SERVING UP THE SAME (bleep). MY GOD, YOU ARE THE ARBY'S OF NEWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW CAN I NOT BE OBSESSED WITH THE ARBY'S OF NEWS. ARBY'S THE HANNITY OF ROAST BEEF SANDWICHES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS THE PARADOX AT THE HEART OF YOUR SHOW, THAT YOUR PURELY BLIND PARTISAN IMPULSES ARE COUCHED IN SUCH LOFTY PRINCIPLE. EVERYTHING FRAMED IN TERMS OF THE POWER OF YOUR PATRIOTISM. YOU'VE GOT THE FLAG PINS, YOU GOT THE BACKDROPS. YOU GOT THE GRAPHICS. THE PATRIOTIC BALL COZIES YOU SELL ON YOUR  WEB SITE AND YET, YOU, THE --  WHAT? THEY ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE. THEY ARE MADE IN MALAYSIA. YET, YOU, THE UBER-AMERICAN, THIS MAN IS YOUR CAUSE.
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AS EVEN EXISTING.
Jon: HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE AMERICA'S EXISTENCE. HE IS U.S.-ATHEIST BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES EXIST. IN FACT, IT WAS CREATED BY THOSE GUYS AND THAT DOCUMENT YOU LOVE SO, SO MUCH.
THE BEAUTY OF, I THINK, OUR FRAMERS AND THE FOUNDERS IS THEY PUT IN PLACE THIS DOCUMENT WHERE THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO RIGHT WRONGS AND CORRECT INJUSTICES.
RIGHT.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLY WANT A RETURN TO FIRST PRINCIPLES AND CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.
I LOVE WASHINGTON BECAUSE HE GAVE UP POWER. AMAZING TO ME WHEN HE COULD HAVE HELD ON TO IT.
WASHINGTON. NOW THERE'S A FOUNDING FATHER WHO COULD FOUND THE (bleep) OUT OF EVERYONE.
HOW DO YOU THINK HE WOULD HANDLE AN ARMED GROUP OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REJECTIONISTS WHO WOULDN'T PAY THEIR TAXES? WELL, WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO SPECULATE BECAUSE IT WAS CALLED THE WHISKEY REBELLION, AND WASHINGTON WITH HIS FEDERAL ARMY CRUSHED IT IN 1794, I GUESS WOULD YOU SAY DISPROPORTIONALLY. AND THE REASON THAT HE WAS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT WAS BECAUSE A MAN NAMED DANIEL SHAYS PULLED THE SAME (bleep) IN 1786 AND 1787. THAT'S HIM APPARENTLY ROLLING DOWN A HILL. SO THE FOUNDING FATHERS CALLED THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION TO FORM A MUCH STRONGER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT COULD COLLECT  TAXES BY FORCE IF NECESSARY WHICH I GUESS MAKES YOU, SEAN HANNITY, NOT AN AMERICAN PATRIOT BUT AN ANTI-FEDERALIST OR TO BE KIND LET'S JUST SAY YOU LOVE THE FOUNDING FATHERS BUT ONLY THEIR EARLY WORK BEFORE THEY SOLD OUT AND BECAME THE MAN OR MEN OR WHITE PROPERTY OWNING MEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
