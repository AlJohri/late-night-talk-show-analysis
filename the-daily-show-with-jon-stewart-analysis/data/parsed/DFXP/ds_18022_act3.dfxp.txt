(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  J&J WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  THE DIRECTOR, HE IS ONE OF  THE SUBJECT OF A NEW DOCUMENTARY FILM CALLED  BROOKLYN CASTLE.
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
SOME PEOPLE COMPARE TO US  THE YANKEES IN CHESS BECAUSE  WE'VE WON SOME OF, SO IT MAKES DISAPPOINTMENT  HARSHER.
HOW DID YOU DO?
YOU DON'T WHAT TO HAVE TO  FACE THAT.
IT WOULD BE A SHAME  BECAUSE OF SOME CORRUPT  BANKER RUINING THE ECONOMY THAT OUR KIDS COULDN'T GO ON  THE TRIP.
AS YOUR SCHOOL PRESIDENT  MY PRIMARY GOAL IS TO  RESTORE MONEY LOST FROM THE BUDGET CUT.
PLEASE WELCOME KATIE AND  POBO. NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU.
GOOD.
Jon: AN INCREDIBLE STORY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING  HERE THIS IS IS 318.
UH-HUH.
Jon: AND IT HAS MORE  CHESS CHAMPIONSHIPS THAN ANY  INTERPEDIAT SCHOOL EVER.
EVER.
Jon: EVER, EVER, EVER AND  DECIDE TO MAKE A FILM THERE,  AND WHILE YOU ARE FILMING THE BUDGET GETS CUT.
YEAH SO, WE STARTED  SHOOTING AND THE SCHOOL WAS  IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE. THEY HAD ALL THEIR MONEY TO  GO TO TALL THEIR TOURNAMENTS  AND THEN I GOT A CALL FROM THE PRINCIPAL TELLING ME OUR  BUDGET GOT SLASHED BY A  MILLION DOLLARS AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE WILL GET TO GO TO  ALL THE TOURNAMENTS QZ  PUBLIC SCHOOL.
IN BROOKLYN.
Jon: ONE OF THE BEST  THINGS AT THIS PUBLIC  SCHOOL.
UH-HUH.
YEAH.
Jon: LET ME JUST QUICKLY  BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL KEEP TALKING WHILE YOU  MAKE A MOVE.
ALL RIGHT.
Jon: SO HOW DID YOU GET  INVOLVED. DID YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT  CHESS WHEN YOU WENT TO THAT  SCHOOL, DID YOU GO TO THAT  SCHOOL FOR THE CHESS  PROGRAM.
I WENT THERE A LOT, WHEN  I WAS YOUNG I BEGAN PLAYING  CHESS WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD AND IN THE FOURTH GRADE. AND SO I HAD AN IDEA ABOUT  THE GAME AND I KNEW A LOT  ABOUT THE GAME WHEN I CAME INTO 318. WHEN I WAS YOUNG COMPETED  AGAINST 318 WAS KIND LIKE  YOU ALWAYS USED TO CALL THEM THE EVIL SCHOOL. THEY ALWAYS USED TO BEAT US.
Jon: THE EVIL EMPIRE,  LIKE THE YANKEES, DIFFICULT  TO BEAT.
THE YANKEES ARE NOT EVIL  EMPIRE TO ME.
Jon: ON THE MET'S FAN,  I'M GOING TO GO WITH EVIL  EMPIRE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, AND WHEN  I GOT TO 318 I THOUGHT IT  WAS A MAGNIFICENT SCHOOL WITH A GREAT PROGRAM. AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE  TEACHERS. AND IT WAS JUST GREAT.
Jon: YEAH, MAKE YOUR  MOVE. SO LET ME ASK YOU THIS,  THOUGH. SO YOU GO THERE, AND YOU'RE  DOING THAT, YOU'RE THE  PRESIDENT OF THE CLASS.
YES.
Jon: YOU REFER TO  YOURSELF AS POBAMA. POBO. SO YOU FIND YOURSELF JUST  AFTER TAKING OFFICE IN A  HUGE FISCAL DISASTER.
YES. (APPLAUSE)
YES.
Jon: IN MANY WAYS THE  SAME BEQUEATHED TO YOU BY  YOUR PREDECESSOR WHO  WAS-- WHAT BUSH PRESIDENT 318 OR NO HE WASN'T.
THE YEAR BEFORE HE WAS.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M  SAYING. SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS,  DOW SUDDENLY HAVE TO SWITCH  FOCUS IN YOUR FILM.
YEAH, WE DIDN'T EXPECT IT  AT ALL. BUT WE JUST ROLLED WITH IT. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY NOW IT WAS  LIKE THIS BIG THING THAT WAS  HAPPENING AND IT WAS  HAPPENING AT SCHOOLS  EVERYWHERE. WHETHER THEY WENT TO  TOURNAMENTS OR NOT ANY MORE  WASN'T AS QUITE AS IMPORTANT  AS JUST FIGURING OUT WHY THE TEAM WAS GOOD. AND WHAT IT WAS DOING FOR  THE KIDS. AND IT WAS DOING A LOT FOR  THEM. IT WAS REALLY UP SETTING TO  FIND OUT THEY MIGHT NOT BE  ABLE TO GO TO ALL THEIR  TOURNAMENTS.
Jon: WHAT IS SO  FASCINATING. THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, YOU  KNOW WE TALK SOME OF ABOUT  WELL NOW IT'S NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND WE TEACH TO THE  TEXT. AS A STUDENT THERE IS A  PROGRAM IN THIS SCHOOL THAT  IS CLEARLY LIGHTING UP THESE CHILDREN'S HEARTS AND MINDS. AND BRINGING OUT THE  ABSOLUTE BEST IN THEM.
UH-HUH.
Jon: AND THE FIRST THING  WE DO IN THAT SITUATION IS  SAY WELL, THAT'S THE THING THAT HAS TO GO. YOU'RE CUTTING THE VITAL  APPENDAGE NOT THE THINGS AND  SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY FOR  TESTS. HOW DID THAT FEEL AS A  STUDENT.
WOW, FIRST I WAS ANNOYED  BY THE EXAMS. (LAUGHTER)  I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE  WASTE OF TIME. AND I SAID-- .
Jon: TEACHING TO THE TEST  AND ALL THOSE SORTS OF  THINGS.
MY 8th GRADE TEACHER WAS  NOT A TEACHER WHO TAUGHT TO  THE TEST AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT HE WAS  ACTUALLY THE BEST TEACHER I  HAVE EVER HAD.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. BECAUSE TEACHING IS AN ART  FORM.
IT, IT IS. AND I-- IF THERE IS ANY  TEACHER I REALLY RESPECT  TEACHERS. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HE DOESN'T KNOW,  HE'S ONLY A STUDENT.
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
THE TEACHERS WORK VERY  HARD AND THEY WORK SO HARD  AND FOR THEM TO GET TARGETED AS BEING DEMONIZED AS THE  PROBLEM FOR WHY OUR  EDUCATION IS BAD IS ABSURD. THE TEACHERS ARE FABULOUS. AND A LOT OF MY TEACHERS  THAT I HAD, ACCORDING TO THE  CITY THEY ARE BAD. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER  IS I LOVE THEM.
Jon: BECAUSE THEY'RE  BEING NOW KRADED ON A  CRITERIA THAT IS MUCH MORE  SORT OF ARITHMETIC.
VERY BLACK AND WHITE. UNTIL I GOT INTO-- I NEVER  PLAYED CHESS AND SO TO WALK  INTO A CLASSROOM -- --  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: HE'S KILLING ME OVER  HERE, I THOUGHT I WOULD GO  TO YOU, SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS DOING.
I LEARNED SOMETHING. I DIDN'T KNOW, TO WALK INTO  I A CLASSROOM AND SEE THE  CHESS TEACHER TEACHING CHESS AND FOR ME TO BE YOU KNOW,  TO FIND IT SO INTERESTING  WHEN HI NO IDEA WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS ANOTHER  EXAMPLE OF WHAT A WONDERFUL  TEACHER SHE WAS AND HOW,  LIKE, SHE WAS ENGAGING KIDS IN A WAY TAU DON'T NORMALLY  SEE.
Jon: WHAT IS SO  INTERESTING ABOUT THE FILMS  IS YOU ALMOST FEEL THE LIFE GOING ON FOR THESE KIDS. YOU FEEL THEIR PASSION. AND YOU FEEL-- AND YOU SEE  THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES. AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING WHEN  YOU THINK THAT'S IN  JEOPARDY.
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. LIKE WHEN ARE YOU LOOKING AT  A PIECE OF PAPER WITH BUDGET  LINES. CUT THAT, CUT THAT. YOU DON'T KNOW POBO, ROCHEEL  OR JUSTICE OR PATRICK OR  LEXUS AND YOU DON'T REALIZE.
Jon: PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE. YOU MOVED ON TO HIGH SCHOOL  WRCHL ARE YOU AT IN HIGH  SCHOOL.
I'M AT HIGH SCHOOL IN  QUEENS.
Jon: THAT GOT A HUGE  ROUND OF APPLAUSE, RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE-- WHAT IS THAT  NOW, HOW MANY KID GOES  THERE.
3900.
Jon: 3900.
YEAH RZ AND.
Jon: AND HOW MANY SHOULD  GO THERE.
2300.
Jon: AND THAT'S WHAT IS  GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS NOW. YOU HAVE THESE INCREDIBLY  INTELLIGENT PASSIONATE YOUNG  PEOPLE. IT JUST, WHAT YOU GUYS ARE  DOING IS INCREDIBLE. I GIVE YOU ALL THE RESPECT  IN THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
Jon: IT'S TREMENDOUS. THE FILL SOME GREAT. I URGE PEOPLE TO SEE. IF YOU AND I WILL CONTINUE  THIS GAME AS WE GO TO  COMMERCIAL. BROOKLYN CASTLE PLAYING IN  SELECT CITIES, OPENING IN  MORE ON FRIDAY, THROUGHOUT THE MONTH, KATIE AND POBO,  PLEASE GO SEE THIS FILM. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
