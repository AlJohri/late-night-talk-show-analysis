SEPTEMBER 9th, 2013, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART, GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT MY GUEST SHERI FINK THE AUTHOR OF THE FEEL GOOD BOOK FIVE DAYS AT MEMORIAL, THE STORY OF FIVE DAYS POST KATRINA AT A HOSPITAL-- VERY DISTURBING. OF COURSE OUR TOP STORY THE ONGOING DEBATE ON WHAT TO DO ABOUT SYRIA. THAT IS ACTUALLY THE LOGO FOR SIRI. (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL CERA. PRETTY SURE THAT'S THE DUCK FROM WONDER PETS THIS IS SEWIOUS ♪ ♪.
I AM AWARE OF MING MING'S CATCH-PHRASE. THANK YOU. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A DIFFICULT AND COMPLICATED TOPIC AND REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN REACH DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS FOR COMPLETELY DEFENSIBLE REASONS, OR YOU CAN WATCH CABLE TELEVISION WHERE UNREASONABLE PEOPLE REACH DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS FOR INSANE REASONS. HERE IS A TERRIBLE ARGUMENT AGAINST WAR.
LISTEN THIS VIDEO SENATOR McCAIN OF A SYRIAN, LOOKS LIKE A FIGHTER JET BEING SHOT OUT OF THE SKY. LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAY AFTERWARDS. ALLAH AKBAR, ALLAH AKBAR!
I HAVE A PROBLEM HELPING THOSE PEOPLE OUT SCREAMING THAT AFTER A HIT.
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
Jon: THEY WOULD JUST SCREAM YIPPIE KI YAY MOTHER [BLEEP] LIKE A NORMAL PERSON, I WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. HERE'S MY FAVORITE PART OF THE CLIP THOUGH, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MY FAVORITE PART IS THE EXPRESSION ON DUCE MEADE'S FACE WHEN SENATOR McCAIN EXPLAINS WHAT THAT MEANS.
I HAVE A PROBLEM HELPING THOSE PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS?
SCREAMING THAT AFTER A HIT.
WOULD YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AN AMERICAN CHRISTIAN SAYING THANK GOD, THANK GOD? THAT'S WHAT-- THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. COME ON. (LAUGHTER) LOOK AT THEIR EXPRESSIONS. THEY LOOK LIKE McCAIN JUST CAUGHT THEM MASTURBATTING. IT'S JUST LIKE--  (LAUGHTER) HERE'S MY IMPRESSION OF THE FOX AND FRIENDS DIRECTOR. JUST SEND OUT THE HOOTERS GIRL, I KNOW IT'S NOT TIME YET. GET SOME WINGS OUT THERE! (LAUGHTER) LET'S HEAR A BAD PRO WAR ARGUMENT.
THIS IS A CHOICE AMONG BAD OPTIONS. THIS IS THE LEAST BAD OPTION.
WE'RE GOING KILL CIVILIANS.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE KILLED ANYWAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LOOK, THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE, LET'S FACE FACTS. AT LEAST LET IT BE FROM AN AMERICAN BOMB SO THEY CAN GO TO HEAVEN, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? PERHAPS THE LEAST COMPELLING ARGUMENT FOR WAR CAME FROM HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI.
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON, AS I WAS LEAVING SAN FRANCISCO YESTERDAY, HE SAID TO ME, ARE YOU YES WAR WITH SYRIA, NO WAR WITH SYRIA. I SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HE SAID I THINK NO WAR. I SAID-- .
Jon: SO I SAID TO HIM WHAT THE [BLEEP] DO YOU KNOW. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE FIVE. YOU THINK PURPLE IS A FLAVOR. (LAUGHTER) YOU SLEEP IN A FAKE RACE CAR. (LAUGHTER) YOU'RE SO IRRESPONSIBLE THAT HAVING A TEENAGER WATCH YOU IS SAFER THAN LEAVING YOU ALONE. BY THE WAY, IF YOU LIKE ANY OF THOSE YOU WILL ENJOY MY NEW DOUBLE ALBUM I'M THE TOOTH FAIRY, 80 MINUTES OF THINGS GUARANTEED TO UPSET YOUR CHILD. YOU'LL GET, WE ALL DIE ALONE. AND OF COURSE I'M SANTA CLAUS. AND YES, WE HAVE A FAVORITE CHILD. IT'S NOT YOU. (LAUGHTER) KIDDING, OF COURSE. SURE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI HANDLED THE INNOCENT CHILD'S QUERY WITH GRACE AND COMPASSION. PLEASE, MISS PELOSI, RESPOND TO YOUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WAR.
BUT YOU KNOW THEY'VE KILLED HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN THERE.
HOLY [BLEEP] YOU SAID THAT TO A FIVE-YEAR-OLD? ANYWAY, GOOD NIGHT, SWEETIE. WELL, THERE'S STILL ONE PERSON WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM IN THE SYRIA BOMBING DEBATE. THE PERSPECTIVE BOMBEE, THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE IN OUR NEW SEGMENT, WHAT IS THE GUY WE'RE THINKING OF BOMBING THINK ABOUT US BOMBING HIM? YES, SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD SAT DOWN WITH CHARLIE ROSE FOR AN INTERVIEW ABOUT THE VERY SUBJECT. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I WILL WRITE DOWN WHAT I THINK HE IS GOING TO SAY ABOUT US BOMBING HIM.
WE'VE BEEN LIVING IN THIS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND A HALF, IT IS GOING TO GET WORSE WITH ANY STRIKE OF STUPID WAR.
OH, HE'S AGAINST IT. I HAD DOWN PLEASE BOMB ME. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S SO WEIRD. FOR SOME REASON IT DIDN'T COME OUT WRITTEN WITH THE INK OF THE PEN I'M HOLDING. (LAUGHTER) I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT. BUT I-- DIDN'T. ALL RIGHT, LET'S HEAR ASSAD'S ARGUMENTS AGAINST BOMBING.
THIS IS THE WAR HAS COME TO SUPPORT AL QAEDA AND THE SAME PEOPLE THAT KILL AMERICANS IN THE 11th OF SEPTEMBER.
Jon: OH, DON'T BOMB ME THAT WOULD HELP AL QAEDA, SO. MAYBE WE WANT TO HELP [BLEEP]. ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT A PRETTY GOOD POINT THERE. WHAT ABOUT ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU?
SECRETARY KERRY HAS SAID THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED FROM A REGION CONTROLLED BY YOUR FORCES.
THAT REMINDS ME ABOUT WHAT KERRY SAID ABOUT THE BIG LIE THAT COLIN POWELL SAID IN FRONT OF THE WORLD ON SATELLITE ABOUT THE WMD IN IRAQ BEFORE GOING WAR, WHEN HE SAID THIS IS OUR EVIDENCE. ACTUALLY, HE GETS FALSE EVIDENCE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU NEEDLESSLY INVADE ONE COUNTRY BASED ON FALSE EVIDENCE. SUDDENLY YOU'RE BAD AT WAR. WE'VE HAD A VERY SOLID WAR CAREER, VERY SOLID, BETWEEN 40 TO 60%  JUSTIFIED. BUT ALL ANYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IS THE MOST RECENT ONE OF THE WRONG ONES. IT'S LIKE WE'RE THE BILL BUCKNER OF SUPERPOWERS NOW. ANYWHERE WE GO IN THE WORLD, EVERYBODY'S LIKE ANN-THRAX. ANN-THRAX. AND THAT WASN'T THE WORST PART. ASSAD EVEN USED OUR OWN SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY AGAINST US.
I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS NOW IS LET'S SAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE POLLS SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY NOW DON'T WANT A WAR ANYWHERE, NOT ONLY AGAINST SYRIA.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF BALLS DOES A RUTHLESS DICTATOR HAVE TO CITE PUBLIC OPINION POLLS. (LAUGHTER) YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO SLOW DOWN THERE, MR. GALLUP, PRETTY SURE GASSING YOUR OWN PEOPLE AIN'T HITTING DOUBLE DIGITS EITHER. BUT OF COURSE ASSAD'S ORAL ARGUMENT FAILS TO PERSUADE THERE ARE ALWAYS THREATS.
WILL THERE BE ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICAN BASES IN THE MIDDLE EAST IF THERE IS AN AIR STRIKE.
YOU SHOULD EXPECT EVERYTHING. YOU SHOULD EXPECT EVERYTHING.
Jon: EXPECT EVERYTHING. (LAUGHTER) IT'S ASSAD, IS HE THREATENING US OR PITCHING A NEW TOURISM SLOGAN. (LAUGHTER) DREAMS ARE ATTAINABLE. SYRIA, EXPECT EVERYTHING. FOR MORE ON THE ASSAD INTERVIEW--  (APPLAUSE)
WE ARE JOINED BY SENIOR MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT AASIF MANDVI. THANKS FOR JOINING US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS VERY LITTLE REVEALED IN THIS INTERVIEW. ASSAD SEEMS TO BE STONEWALLING.
WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO SAY, JON. YES, CHARLIE, I GASSED MY OWN THITIZENS.
Jon: ARE YOU GOING AFTER HIS SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. HE HAS BEEN MURDERING HIS OWN PEOPLE FOR TWO YEARS AND ALL YOU HAVE IS THE LISP.
THAT'S ALL I GOT. PRETTY GRIM STORY. PLUS YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT HOW HE REALLY TALKS, RIGHT.
Jon: REALLY, HE FAKED A LISP? WHY WOULD HE FAKE A LISP.
HE'S ON A CHARM OFFENSIVE, JON. HOW ELSE DO YOU WIN HEARTS AND MINDS WHEN YOU ARE A LIPLESS BEADY EYED TYRANT WHO THE ONLY FRIENDS ARE PUTIN AND THE AYATOLLAH.
Jon: VERY HARD. HE COULD SLAP ON ONE OF THEM AMERICAN FLAG PINS THAT WORKS FOR OUR GUYS.
HE DIDN'T SAY CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, HE GASSED A VILLAGE! OKAY, WE'RE WAY PAST FLAG PINS HERE.
Jon: HOW DOES GOING ON NETWORK TV AND SPITTING ALL OVER CHARLIE ROSE HELP HIS IMAGE.
WELL, INSTANT SYMPATHY, JON, COME ON. UNITED STATES, YOU DON'T WANT TO SHOOT A MISSILE AT SOMEONE WHO CAN CAN'T SAY THE LETTER S, ALL RIGHT.
Jon: YOU SOUND LIKE THAT FRENCH CARTOON SKUNK. JUST STOP DOING THAT, ALL RIGHT.
WHY, BECAUSE I'M WORKING MY WAY INTO YOUR HEART.
Jon: NO, YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE NOT. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT THE ALL. OKAY, WELL LOOK, LISP WASN'T THE FIRST WORST THING THEY TRIED. YOU TRIED THIS BEFORE WITH THE COLIN POWELL-- AND YELLOW PUDDIN POP, BAH.
Jon: THEY CONSIDERED GOING WITH THE COSBY VOICE.
OF COURSE. ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED CHARACTERS OF ALL TIME. NOBODY WANTS TO BOMB DR.  HUXTABLE.
Jon: TRUE.
BUT HE HAD COPYRIGHT ISSUES.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. HE COMMITTED ATROCITIES. ONE LISPY OR COSBYESQUE INTERVIEW WON'T ERASE WHAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS GUY.
NOT ON ITS OWN. IT'S ONLY ONE PIECE IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO REHABILITATE HIS MURDEROUS IMAGE. MEDIA 101, CHARLIE ROSE IN THE MORNING, COUNTS TO 10 WITH MUPPETS ON "SESAME STREET", THEN HE WRAPS IT UP WITH THIS.
Jon: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES, AASIF, THAT IS NEVER-- WOW, HE'S GOT SOME MOVES.
HE IS VERY LIKABLE.
Jon: HE REALLY IS THANK YOU, AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
