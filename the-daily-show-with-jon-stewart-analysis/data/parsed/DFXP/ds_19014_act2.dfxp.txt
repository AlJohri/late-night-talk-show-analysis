[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. LISTEN TO THIS:  GAY MARRIAGE IS NOW LEGAL IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK, MASSACHUSETTS, CALIFORNIA, YOU KNOW, THE GAY STATES. [LAUGHTER] BUT HOW LONG UNTIL THE REST OF THE NATION SEES THE LIGHT? AL MADRIGAL FILED THIS REPORT.
STATE AFTER STATE IS RACING TO LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS NOT WHO WILL BE NEXT IT'S WHO WILL BE LAST? STATISTICIAN NATE SILVER. STATES PROBABLY THE SLOWEST TO MOVE TOWARDS LEGALIZATION ARE MOSTLY IN THE SOUTH, WHAT WE CALL THE DEEP SOUTH, IN PARTICULAR ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI ARE MAYBE THE LAST TWO.
WHEN YOU WENT TO MISSISSIPPI, WHAT DO YOU FIND?
I DIDN'T GO TO MISSISSIPPI.
WHAT ABOUT ALABAMA? YOU WENT TO ALABAMA?
I'M NOT BEEN TO ALABAMA.
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A  STATISTICIAN. I THINK ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE IS INTERESTING AND ADDS COLOR TO A STORY.
OF COURSE, ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI. SO WHO IS IT GOING TO BE? CLETUS OR BETUS. IT WAS TIME TO SEE WHICH ONE OF THESE BACKWOODS INBRED, HOMOPHOBIC STATES WILL SWIM AGAINST THE TIDE OF HISTORY LONGEST. WE'LL SEE WHO HAS THE INTOLERANCE EDGE. IN THIS CORNER FROM THE STATE THAT STILL HAS SEGREGATED SORORITIES, ALABAMA LAWYER DOUG JONES.
WITH REGARD TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, ALABAMA WILL BE THE LAST STATE IF WE EVER RATIFY.
AND IN THE OTHER CORNER FROM A STATE WITH THE CONFEDERATE FLAG INSIDE THEIR OWN STATE FLAG FLMISSISSIPPI  COLUMNIST SLIMLAG SMITH.
MISSISSIPPI WILL BE LAST  GET THERE KICKING AND SCREAMING ALL THE WAY. I WISH IT WEREN'T TRUE BUT IT IS.
TIME FOR A GOOD OLD FASHIONED INTOLERANCE-OFF.
WE PASSED AN AMENDMENT SAYING NOT ONLY CAN YOU NOT HAVE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY FORM OF CIVIL UNION THAT LOOKS LIKE A MARRIAGE.
MISSISSIPPI WAS THE LAST TO RATIFY THE 13TH AMENDMENT THAT OUTLAWED SLAVERY.
ALABAMA'S CONSTITUTION MANDATES SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR WHITE AND COLORED STUDENTS.
YOU SAID COLORED?
OH, YEAH.
IS THIS TOUGH?
IT'S TOUGH.
WHERE DOES ALABAMA STAND ON SODOMY?
IT'S A CLASS A MISDEMEANOR IN THIS STATE.
IN MISSISSIPPI IT'S A FELONY.
SERIOUS?
I'M SURPRISED A GAY COUPLE CAN GET A FISHING LICENSE IN MISSISSIPPI LET ALONE A MARRIAGE LICENSE.
DID YOU SAY FISTING?
FISHING LICENSE.
THAT MAKES SENSE. PICKING A WINNER IS TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT. I HIRED TWO STUNT PERFORMERS PLAYING REAL LIVE GAYS. WE WOULD CAPTURE THE INTOLERANCE OF REDNECKS TO ACTS OF SIMULATED GAYNESS. THE STATE WITH THE LEAST TOLERANCE WINS. ROUND ONE THE GAY PDA TEST. OKAY. NO ONE SEEMED TO NOTICE. MAYBE WE WERE BEING TOO SUBTLE BUT THEN IN ALABAMA IT HAPPENED.
PUNK ROCK GAY COUPLE. THAT'S COOL.
Y'ALL REALLY DIG EACH OTHER. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, MAN.
(bleep) (bleep).
WHAT THE (bleep) WAS THAT. MISSISSIPPI YOU HAVE A HUGE OPENING HERE. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU  GOT AT THIS STATE FAIR PHOTO BOOTH.
ONE, TWO, THREE. OKAY.
LOOK AT THAT.
THAT WILL BE MIGHTY NICE ON THE WALL.
YEA.
COME ON, REALLY EVEN THE SALTY OLD CARNEY WAS PRO-GAY. SURELY TWO GAYS AT A LIVESTOCK SHOW WILL DO THE TRICK. NOTHING? THAT'S IT. WE'LL SETTLE THIS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY IN A WAFFLE HOUSE. Y'ALL WANT  EVERYBODY TO KNOW WE MET TWO YEARS AGO AT A  WAFFLE HOUSE AND I WANT TO SAY, MICHAEL, WOULD YOU MARRY ME.
NO YOU ARE NOT.
IF YOU WOULD DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS SPECIAL TO ME.
YES! [  APPLAUSE  ]
THAT'S CLAPPING? OKAY MISSISSIPPI LAST CHANCE TO BRING SOME AUTHENTIC ANT-GAY REDNECK VENOM.
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?
YES, YES! [  APPLAUSE  ]
SERIOUSLY, THESE ARE THE TWO GAYEST STATES IN THE UNION. I WAS OWED AN EXPLANATION. [LAUGHTER] HOW WAS YOUR TRIP, SIR?
UM, SUPER GAY.
EVEN IF THESE STATES 30% OF PEOPLE MIGHT SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE.
I WATCHED TWO MEN PROPOSE TO EACH OTHER IN A WAFFLE HOUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED?
THERE WAS AN APPLAUSE BREAK.
ALABAMA MIGHT AS WELL BE BLOWING MISSISSIPPI RIGHT NOW. HAVE YOU SEEN THEM ON THE MAP?
THEY ARE KIND OF BUTT TO BUTT THERE ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI THAT IS TRUE. GLAD YOU SAID IT.
FOR ALL OF OUR ATTEMPTS TO STEREOTYPE SOUTHERNERS FOR STEREOTYPING GAY PEOPLE THEY SHOWED US THEY WON'T BE BE PUT INTO A BOX UNLESS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE INTO
