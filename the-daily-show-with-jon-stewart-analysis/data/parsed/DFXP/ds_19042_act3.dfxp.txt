[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR, A COMEDIAN. HIS NEW FILM WHICH HE PRODUCED, COWROTE AND STARS IN IS CALLED "PHILOMENA."
I HAD A HIP REPLACED SINCE LAST YEAR, MARTIN.
RIGHT.
IT'S MUCH BETTER. AND IT'S TITANIUM SO IT WON'T RUST.
GOOD JOB OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE TO OIL YOU LIKE THE TIN MAN.
IS THAT RIGHT?
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE WIZARD OF OZ.
HE'S JOKING, MUM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME STEVE COOGAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
NICE TO BE HERE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, FOR EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS YOU AND YOUR GREAT COMEDY, THIS IS A SURPRISING PROJECT FOR YOU TO TAKE ON. BRIEFLY WHAT IS THE STORY OF THIS AND HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN IT?
I READ AN ARTICLE IN THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER HERE IN NEW YORK DOING THE MOVIE CALLED THE OTHER GUYS WITH WILL FERRELL.
Jon: YES, VERY FUNNY.
THE DOWNTIME IN THE SCENES PLAYING A BRITISH (bleep) WHICH I'M QUITE GOOD AT, I SAW THIS ARTICLE IN THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT THIS OLD LADY WITH THE TITLE "THE CATHOLIC CHURCH STOLE MY CHILD." IT WAS ABOUT HIM BEING ADOPTED FALSELY AND TAKEN TO AMERICA AND HER STORY OF HER SEARCH FOR HER SON. IT SOUNDED FULL OF LAUGHS TO ME.
Jon: A GOOD SEQUEL TO THE OTHER GUYS. [ LAUGHTER ]
THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF PHILOMENA AND THEY WERE LAUGHING. I THOUGHT IF I COULD GET A LAUGH IN THE TRAGIC STORY MAYBE I COULD GET SOMETHING WORTH WATCHING.
Jon: THAT IS THE INCREDIBLE -- IT'S, MAN, IT'S A MOVING STORY. IT'S A DARK STORY AT TIMES. IT'S POWERFUL. THERE ARE A TON OF LAUGHS IN IT. YOU KNOW THIS, IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SERIOUS TOPICS AND YOU WANT TO WIN OVER AN ARGUMENT OR MAKE YOUR POINT, IF YOU GET PEOPLE LAUGHING THEY LET THEIR GUARD DOWN AND THEY ARE MORE OPEN TO THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE PUTTING. SO PUTTING LAUGHS INTO SERIOUS STUFF A GOOD THING.
Jon: HOW HARD WAS IT FOR YOU. THERE'S MOMENTS IN THE FILM WHERE I'M WATCHING YOU BE SERIOUS AND EARNEST, THE COMEDIAN IN ME, MY HEART WANTS TO REACH OUT AND GO, "DO A DICK JOKE." [LAUGHTER] WHY DON'T YOU FART?
I WAS TEMPTED. [LAUGHTER] THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOKES IN THERE. BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE BALLS TO SAY NO JOKES NOW. YOU SHOULD PRACTICE THAT SOMETIME.
Jon: I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO. I'M UNCOMFORTABLE. I'M A TYPICAL REPRESSED BRIT. IT'S HOW I AM. [LAUGHTER] YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS -- IT'S THIS WOMAN'S STORY. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THERE'S CONTROVERSY NOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING THAT IT'S ANTI-CATHOLIC. YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU FELT LIKE THE POPE WOULD LIKE IT.
I THINK AS POPES GO, YOU KNOW -- [LAUGHTER] -- HE SEEMS PRETTY GOOD.
Jon: SEEMS REALLY GOOD.
AS POPES GO.
Jon: HE DOES. HE'S AT THE TOP OF THE POPE LIST.
WE HOPE HE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. IT'S NOT ANTI-RELIGIOUS. IT'S ALSO ABOUT FORGIVENESS. I PLAY THE SMUG CONCEITED LIBERAL. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANY OF THEM.
Jon: NOT HERE IN NEW YORK. MAYBE OUT IN THE MIDWEST.
HE GETS HIS IN THE END OF MOVIE. THERE'S BALANCE THERE.
Jon: SHE RETAINS FAITH. IT'S NOT A STORY NECESSARILY OF CHURCH BUT OF THE TIME. OF AN ERA WHEN THIS WAS VIEWED DIFFERENTLY THAN IT IS NOW.
IT IS ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ABOUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED, BUT ALSO THE NATURE OF FAITH. IT WAS ONCE SAID NO ONE HAS A MONOPOLY ON WISDOM. MARTIN IS SECULAR IN THE MOVIE. HE IS NONRELIGIOUS AND PHILOMENA IS RELIGIOUS TO THE END. HE DOESN'T FIND GOD AND SHE CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN GOD BUT THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AND RESPECT EACH OTHER.
Jon: HAS SHE SEEN IT? WAS SHE ABLE TO SEE IT?
YEAH, SHE'S BEEN ON THE PUBLICITY TRAIL WITH US. SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T SHUT HER UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HAVE YOU TRIED LEANING IN AND GOING SHUT THE (bleep).
I HAVE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
Jon: WHAT?
YEAH, I KNOW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU MUST FEEL INCREDIBLE BURDEN WHEN YOU ARE TELLING SOMEONE'S STORY LIKE THAT TO BE THE CARETAKER OF THAT STORY. DID YOU WATCH IT WITH HER. WERE YOU IN THE ROOM?
NO, NO I WOULDN'T DO THAT. NO, NO. SHE WAS -- AT FIRST SHE WAS NERVOUS ABOUT IT. WE POKE FUN AT HER, HER LITTLE OLD CONSERVATIVE BLUE COLLAR WAYS. BUT IN THE END SHE EMERGES HEROICALLY. SHE GETS A FREE PASS. YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE CRITICISM, SOME OF IT CAME FROM THE NEW YORK POST.
Jon: NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT.
IT'S A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT NEWSPAPER.
Jon: OWNED BY A BRILLIANT MEDIA MAGNATE.
A LOVELY GUY NAMED RUPERT MURDOCH. HE'S SO KIND ABOUT PEOPLE AND GOOD VALUES.
Jon: SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CHRISTIAN FELLA.
YEAH, YEAH. IF YOU GET CRITICIZED BY "THE NEW YORK POST" THEN YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
Jon: OR YOU ARE IN A HOT TUB SUCKING ON SOMEONE'S TOES. THAT'S THE MOST RECENT.
THAT'S NEXT ON MY LIST.
Jon: WELCOME TO THE CITY THEN. PHILOMENA IS IN THEATERS NOW. IT'S DOING GANGBUSTERS AND IT'S GREAT AND YOU ARE GREAT IN IT. STEVE COOGAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
