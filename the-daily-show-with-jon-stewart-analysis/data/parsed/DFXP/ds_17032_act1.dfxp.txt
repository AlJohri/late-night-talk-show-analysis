DECEMBER 8th, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW  WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD GUEST, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST ED GILLESPIE WILL BE JOINING US, I WILL ASK HIM ABOUT THE  GOP REPUBLICAN FIELD AND I WILL SIT BACK AND WATCH HIM WEEP, WEEP, LIKE A CHILD, WILL WEEP. (LAUGHTER) OH, WHERE ARE YOU, JEB BUSH?   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (LAUGHTER) QUICK OFF THE TOP. A COUPLE NIGHTS AGO I RESPONDED TO THE WAY CHRISTMAS SELL BRANTS FEEL WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO  CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS AT ALL TIMES AND ALL PLACES. AND I ADDRESSED OUR NATION THUSLY.
MY FELLOW AMERICAN, TONIGHT I HUM BELOW COME BEFORE YOU TO DECLARE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
THAT WAS TWO DAYS AGO. NOW LOOK AT ME. (LAUGHTER) LOOK HOW WAR AGES A MAN. THAT IS WEIRD, HOW CAN I AGE IN TWO DAYS. IS THAT-- WELL, LAST NIGHT ONE OF SANTA'S UNUSUALLY LARGE ELVES FIRED BACK.
OUR PAL JON STEWART IS FOLLOWING THE VARIOUS CHRISTMAS CONTROVERSIES VERY CLOSELY.
NO, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT MR. STEWART IS GOING TO HELL. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I KNOW. (LAUGHTER) BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU AND YOUR MIGNONS DON'T UNDERSTAND, O'REILLY. YOUR HELL DOESN'T SCARE ME. I MAKE MY LIVING WATCHING FOX NEWS EIGHT HOURS A DAY. (LAUGHTER) I'M ALREADY IN HELL. (LAUGHTER) BOOM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BOOM! YOUR MOVE, O'REILLY! ACTUALLY, TALK OF THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS BRINGS ME TO A FUN FACT. DID YOU KNOW THAT NOT ALL AMERICANS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS? (LAUGHTER) IT'S TRUE. MANY AMERICAN JEWS CELEBRATE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HOLIDAY CALLED-- HOW COME WE  DON'T GET TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. I SEE. IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION FORUM. IT IS CELEBRATED EVERY FOUR YEARS. FOR THIS HOLIDAY JEWS COMMEMORATE THE MIRACLE OF INCREDIBLY RELIGIOUS CHRISTIAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATES FIGHTING OVER WHO LOVES JEWS MORE. AND LO, GOD PROVIDED THE HEBREWS TWO GOOD LOOK MORMONS, THOUGH THEY HAD PRAYED FOR BUT ONE. WELL, TO BE HONEST, NONE, THEY WANTED GIULIANI BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO WHO WILL WIN THE TUCHUS TUCHUS-KISSOFF.
KAREN AND I HAVE BEEN TO ISRAEL.
WE BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE, YOU KNOW, TILES THAT SAID "PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM" AND WE HAVE THAT  ON OUR KITCHEN RIGHT ABOVE OUR SINK.
Jon: AH! (LAUGHTER) SO SANTORUM OPENS WITH-- I HAVE ONE OF YOUR TCHOTCHKES. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND I WAS ALSO THINKING ABOUT BUYING ONE OF THEM GLASS BIRDS THAT LOOKS  LIKE THEY'RE DRINKING, MAYBE HAS A LITTLE TINY TOP HAT THAT SAYS ISRAEL BUT  WOULDN'T FIT IN THE LUGGAGE. CAN ANYONE TOP SANTORUM.
I FEEL AS SHERYL SHARED WITH YOU A VERY SPECIAL CONNECTION TO ISRAEL. WHEN I FIRST VISITED THE HOLY LAND. REPEATEDLY BEEN TO THE WESTERN WALL. THAT MOST SACRED SYMBOL OF WHERE JEWISH PILGRIMS GATHER TO PRAY TODAY.
Jon: NICE. ANYBODY CAN GRAB A SOUVENIR TILE AT THE DUTY-FREE AT THE AIRPORT. YOU WENT TO A RUIN. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT.
THE DAY AFTER I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, I LEFT AND I TOOK A PLANE AND I WENT TO  WORK ON A KIBBUTZ.
Jon: HOLY-- WE HAVE A WINNER! OH MY GOSH! (APPLAUSE)
Jon: SHE WORKED ON A KIBBUTZ. MICHELE BACHMANN LOVES ISRAEL SO MUCH SHE WAS WILLING TO JOIN A SOCIALIST COLLECTIVE. WOW! BUT WHAT WOULD YOU AS PRESIDENT DO FOR ISRAEL.
STRATEGIC AID IN ALL FORMS UNDER A PERRY ADMINISTRATION WILL INCREASE TO ISRAEL.
THE UNITED STATES WILL STOP IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, PERIOD.
IRAN'S AYATOLLAHS WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONSES.
THE UNITED STATES WILL MOVE OUR EMBASSY FROM TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM.
Jon: I WILL GET ON A PLANE ON MY FIRST DAY AS PRESIDENT TO JERUSALEM AND  PUT A PALESTINIAN IN A HEAD LOCK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I WILL GIVE THEM A WEDGEY. -- BACHMANN IS KILLING IT. LET'S CHECK IN ON HOW SHE IS DOING ON THE YARMULKOMETER, OH, SHE'S -- OWE, SUPERSTAR OF DAVID! WOW ALL SHE REALLY NEEDS TO DO NOW IS STICK THE LANDING AT THE END OF HER SPEECH, HIT IT.
SHALOM ALECHEIM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT SO, GOOD FOR YOU, NICE TO THROW DOWN A LITTLE OF THE HEBREW TO  JEWISH FORUM, THAT WAS NICE. THAT TAKES A LOT OF --
HE HAS A LOT OF HUTZPAH.
Jon: I WAS GOING TO SAY HUTS PARK I WAS GOING TO SAY CAJONES, BUT OKAY. IN THE END THE BIG WIN NEVER THE FORUM WAS ONE NEWT GINGRICH WHO RECEIVED STATE  OF THE UNIONESQUE APPLAUSE, STANDING OVATIONS AND THE KIND OF LAUGHTER THAT JACKIE MASON WOULD KILL FOR AND HAS.
I WILL IN THE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH CHALLENGE THE PRESIDENT TO SEVEN THREE-HOUR DEBATES. I WILL CONCEDE IN ADVANCE THAT HE CAN USE A TELEPROMPTER.
Jon: DID YOU HEAR THAT? WE DO NOT ADD THE LADY GOING GOING-- NAAAAH! THAT'S HOW FUNNY JEWS THINK TELEPROMPTER JOKES ARE. COULD MITT ROMNEY NEWT'S MAIN RIVAL MATCH HIM? HE GOT APPLAUSE. HE ACTUALLY TOO GOT A STANDING OVATION AT THE END OF HIS SPEECH. THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD FOR MITT.
REMEMBER THE GEORGE COSTANZA LINE WHEN THEY ARE LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING, YOU SIT DOWN.
Jon: OH, MISQUOTING SEINFELD IN FRONT OF A JEWISH AUDIENCE, THAT'S GOING TO COST YA! SEE FIRST OF ALL IT IS NOT A GEORGE KOTION TANZA LINE, IT'S JERRY'S LINE.
GEORGE, WHEN YOU HIT THAT HIGH NOTE, SAY GOOD NIGHT AND WALK OFF.
Jon: AND YOU GOT THE LINE WRONG, THAT WOULD BE LIKE STANDING UP THERE AND GOING  LIKE THE FASCIST SOUP VENDOR USED TO SAY, I AM AFRAID THAT I AM OUT OF DELICIOUS SOUP. HA, HA, HA. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW DOES THAT AFFECT ROMNEY'S RANK ON THE YARMULKOMETER. OH, HE IS DOWN TO ABOUT-- OH, I HAVE NO CANDIDATE. I HAVE NO CANDIDATE! INTERESTINGLY, THE ONE CANDIDATE ABSENT FROM THE DEBATE WAS RON PAUL. HE IS DOING VERY WELL IN THE POLLS BUT ACCORDING TO RJC EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MATT  BROOKS HE WAS LEFT OUT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COUNCIL REJECTS HIS  MISGUIDED AND EXTREME VIEWS ON ISRAEL. WOW, MISGUIDED AND EXTREME, OH MY GOD, HAS HE SUGGESTED ISRAEL HAS NO RIGHT TO EXIST OR THAT IT IS TO BE  EXCHANGED FOR RHODE ISLAND.
WOULD YOU CUT AID TO ISRAEL.
I WOULD CUT ALL FOREIGN AID. I WOULD TREAT EVERYBODY EQUALLY AND FAIRLY.
Jon: GOOD CALL, NOT INVITING ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO YOUR FORUM WHO  MIGHT DISAGREE WITH YOU. WOULDN'T WANT TO TURN IT INTO A DEBATE. YOU KNOW F THERE IS ONE THING JEWS CAN'T STAND-- ARGUING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
