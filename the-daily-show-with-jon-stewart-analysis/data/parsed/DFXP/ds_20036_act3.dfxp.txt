(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT A FORMER PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER, BEST SELLING AUTHOR, HIS LATEST PROJECT THE DOCUMENTARY FILM, "I AM SANTA CLAUS."
I'M ON STAFF OF WHAT IS POPULARLY CALLED THE SEX CLUB AND YOU WILL NOTICE IT SAYS RIGHT HERE, NO NUDITY AT THE BUFFET. OH, AHHH!
A LITTLE BIT OF SANTA'S COOKIES. I LIE TO PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THIS IS WHAT I SMELL LIKE WHEN I SWEAT. (LAUGHTER)
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MICK FOLEY AS SANTA CLAUS. NOBODY'S EVER BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY MEETING SANTA CLAUS. SO, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES. SO I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICK FOLEY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪♪
Jon: HOW ARE YOU, BROTHER? HOW YOU BEEN?
I'M GOOD, BRO!
Jon: BRO! NO! NO! HOW YOU BEEN? THIS IS VERY FESTIVE.
THIS IS FESTIVE. I DECIDED EARLY ON WHEN YOU'RE DOING A BARE BONES DOCUMENTARY, I WAS GOING TO TRY TO BUILD A LITTLE GRASSROOTS INTEREST SO I DECIDED TO DRESS IT WITH SANTA'S THEMED ATTIRE FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. AND THIS IS, I STARTED, DAY 350.
Jon: YOU'RE KIDDING ME?
350 STRAIGHT DAYS WEARING SANTA-THEMED ATTIRE (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT SOUNDS LIKE A C.I.A. TECHNIQUE. (LAUGHTER)  SO YOU HAVE 15 MORE DAYS.
EXACTLY.
Jon: HAVE YOU PLANNED OUT YOUR FIRST POST SANTA OUTFIT?
IT WILL BE -- IT WILL BE SOMETHING --  IT WILL BE SOMETHING WITH WRESTLING.
Jon: IT WILL BE OVERWHELMING.
YEAH, IT WILL  PROBABLY BE A "THE DAILY SHOW" THING.
Jon: THIS IS PERFECT  -- THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE.
YEAH.
Jon: THIS IS PERFECT FOR YOU. IF THERE'S ANYONE I KNOW THAT I FEEL LIKE IS THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS EMBODIED, IS THE SANTA SPIRIT, IT'S YOU! YOU HAVE THAT WARMTH, THAT GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT. HOW DID YOU COME TO THIS IDEA TO DOCUMENT THOSE THAT ARE SANTAS?
THE DIRECTOR, TOMMY AVALLONE, HE CAME TO ME --
Jon: DON'T MAKE UP NAMES. (LAUGHTER)
HE'S IN THE GREEN ROOM. HE HAD CAST A WRESTLER IN EVERY PROJECT HE HAD DONE. AND HE WAS WONDERING HOW DO I CAST A WRESTLER IN THIS FILM AND SOMEONE TOLD HIM I HAD A YEAR-ROUND CHRISTMAS ROOM FOR 15 YEARS, SOMETHING OF A CHRISTMAS FANATIC, AND THAT I OFTEN DRESSED AS SANTA BUT I'D NEVER BECOME THAT GUY.
Jon RIGHT.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, ONCE WE GOT INTO IT, AND ONCE WE DID THE TRANSFORMATION, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL, THIS IS THE WORST TEMPORARY DARK HAIR DYE JOB YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THE BEARD IS ACTUALLY WHITE UNDER HERE.
Jon: YOUR ACTUAL BEARD IS WHITE?
MY ACTUAL BEARD HAS BEEN BLEACHED WHITE. AND SO --
Jon: OH.
AND SO I WILL MOVE, ONCE I LEAVE -- I ACTUALLY HAVE THE BOOTS ALREADY ON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND WHEN I LEAVE THE STUDIO, I'LL GO TO BROOKLYN AND I'M GONNA SING "MUST BE SANTA" WITH NORAH JONES, CATHERINE POPPER AND SASHA DOBSON --
Jon: REALLY? YOU'RE LIVING THE SANTA LIFE.
I LOVE IT!
Jon: I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU NOW. AFTER CHRISTMAS, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS? THESE SANTAS THAT YOU MET, HOW DID YOU SELECT THE SANTAS? ARE THERE SANTAS THAT WERE LEFT OUT THAT ARE ANNOYED ABOUT THERE, OR ARE THERE -- I HATE TO EVEN SAY THAT.
THERE ARE SOME ANGRY SANTAS. (LAUGHTER) THIS PAST WEEKEND, I SWEAR I'M NOT MAKING ANY OF THIS UP, I TOOK PLACE IN WHAT IS CALLED THE INTERNATIONAL FRUITCAKE EATING CHAMPIONSHIP IN SANTA CLAUS, INDIANA.
Jon: SURE. TERRIFIC COMPETITION.
AND AFTER PLACING SECOND BEFORE BEING DISQUALIFIED FOR HIDING HUGE SOFTBALL SIZE CHUNKS OF FRUITCAKE UNDERNEATH MY TABLE, I FOUND OUT THERE WAS A PLAN TO BOYCOTT AND PICKET AND PROTEST MY APPEARANCE BY OTHER SANTAS. AND AFTER THE INITIAL STING WORE OFF, I MEAN, I IMAGINE HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD THE CRITICISMS OF BRIAN KILLMEAD -- AFTER THEY WORE OFF, I WAS, LIKE, PLEASE PROTEST, THIS WOULD HAVE BE TREMENDOUS.
Jon: YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE HEARD FOR YEARS ABOUT DIVISIONS WITHIN THE SANTA COMMUNITY -- (LAUGHTER) -- AND I JUST HOPE THAT THIS WILL HOPEFULLY GET US TO A BETTER PLACE. WHO ARE THE OTHER SANTAS? IS THERE AN OFFICIAL SANTA ORGANIZATION OR ARE THESE YOUR LONE WOLF SANTAS?
NO, NO, THESE ARE TOPNOTCH GUYS.
Jon: TOPNOTCH SANTAS?
FOUR INDIVIDUAL GUYS. I MEAN, IT'S A, I THINK TOMMY DID A GREAT JOB SELECTING THE GUYS.
Jon: NOW BECAUSE YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THIS NOW, HAS THE SANTA PROTESTS, ARE THEY DONE NOW? LIKE WHY WERE THEY PROTESTING? WERE THEY PROTESTING BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO BE IN IT OR --
I THINK THERE'S A CONFLUENCE OF REASONS. I THINK THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD MAKE THE SANTA WORLD LOOK BAD. I THINK THERE WAS A FEAR.
Jon: YES.
I THINK THERE WAS A FEAR OF, I THINK THERE WAS  A PHOBIA OVER THE POTENTIAL.
Jon: HOW DO YOU MAKE THE SANTA WORLD LOOK BAD? I MEAN, HE'S THE ONE WHOSE ALWAYS JUDGMENTAL ANYWAY. HE'S ALWAYS THE ONE, OH, ARE YOU NAUGHTY OR NICE? YOU KNOW WHAT? IF HE WOULD STOP JUDGING US, WE WOULD STOP JUDGING HIM!
IN THE END, PEOPLE WALK AWAY WITH A DEEPER APPRECIATION OF THE DEDICATION OF THOSE WHO WEAR THE RED SUIT, AND GROWN MEN CRY! JON, I WAS AT THE LAST SCREENING --
Jon: NO, NO DON'T PUSH PAST THIS. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE PHRASE "A DEEPER APPRECIATION FOR THE MEN WHO WEAR THE RED SUIT."
YEAH. I CAN TELL BY YOUR TONE THAT RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT APPRECIATION.
Jon: NO, I DO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M JEWISH. I GREW UP JEWISH. ALL I WANTED ALL MY LIFE WAS FOR THE JEWS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT COULD EVEN MATCH THAT DUDE. WE HAD HANUKKAH HARRY, AND LIKE HANUKKAH HARRY WOULD SHOW UP AND BE LIKE, YEAH, THEY HAVE A MENORAH, AND THEN HE WOULD LEAVE. LIKE, SANTA FOR ME, I THINK SANTA LOOMS LARGER ALMOST FOR NON-CHRISTIANS BECAUSE IT'S THIS AMAZING SEASON WHERE EVERYBODY LOVES THIS GUY AND YOU'RE JUST, LIKE, YEAH, THAT'S NICE...
WE HAD OUR LAST SCREENING WAS IN LONG ISLAND, THE CINEMA ARTS CENTER, WHICH SHOWS MAINLY ART FILMS AND DOCUMENTARIES.
Jon: YEAH.
AND THE WOMAN IN CHARGE CAME UP AND SHE GOES THIS IS MY FAVORITE DOCUMENTARY OF THE YEAR AND I'M JEWISH.
OH THAT'S NICE. RIGHT.
I MEAN, IT MAKES PEOPLE LOVE, I MEAN, WE SHOW THE HARDSHIPS OF THESE GUYS. I JUST REALIZED HOW RIDICULOUS THIS FRILLY SHIRT IS.
NO, NO, NO, NO! DUDE, YOU'RE WEARING SANTA BOOTS. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
WE DOCUMENT THE HARDSHIPS THEY GO THROUGH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. BECAUSE THESE ARE GUYS WHO WANT TO BE THAT GUY.
Jon: OH THIS IS ALL -- THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY JUST DURING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON, IT'S ALL YEAR AROUND?
WELL, THEY WANT, I MEAN, THESE ARE BEARDED SANTAS WHO LOOK LIKE SANTA ALL A YEAR AROUND BUT THEY JUST LIVE FOR SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS WHERE THEY GET TO BE THAT GUY.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I MEAN, THE SANTA, MY SANTA WHO VISITED OUR HOUSE LEGALLY CHANGED HIS NAME TO SANTA CLAUS. THAT'S A LEVEL OF DEDICATION YOU DON'T SEE TOO MUCH.
Jon: WAIT, WHAT?
YEAH.
Jon: HE CHANGED HIS NAME TO SANTA CLAUS?
HE CHANGED HIS NAME TO SANTA CLAUS.
Jon: DO YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH MAIL DOES THAT DUDE GET? (APPLAUSE) THAT'S GOT TO BE, THAT'S AMAZING! WELL, NOBODY BETTER TO TELL THE SANTA STORY THAN THE MAN WITH THE BIGGEST HEART.
THANK YOU.
