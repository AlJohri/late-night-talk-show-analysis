Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW," MY  NAME IS JON STEWART! WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU  TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREAT  MORGAN FREEMAN IS GOING TO BE  JOINING US! BUT FIRST --  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT FIRST, NONFICTIONAL  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA GAVE A MAJOR ADDRESS ON  COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY THIS  AFTERNOON AT WASHINGTON'S  NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY. ACTUAL SAFETY SCHOOL. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT. IN THE SPEECH PRESIDENT OBAMA  QUESTIONED HOW OUR OVERZEALOUS  PROSECUTION OF THE WAR ON TERROR AND THE PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY  MAY BE AFFECTING OUR SOULS.
LOOK AT THE CURRENT SITUATION  WHERE WE ARE FORCE FEEDING  DETAINEES WHO ARE BEING HELD ON A HUNGER STRIKE. IS THIS WHO WE ARE? IS THAT SOMETHING OUR FOUNDERS  FORESAW?
Jon: OH, I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  I ACTUALLY THINK ON A SCALE OF  "FOUNDERS FORESAW" PRISONER  MISTREATMENT WOULD TAKE A BACKSEAT TO "BLACK PRESIDENT."  (LAUGHTER)  I THINK THE FIRST THING THEY  WOULD SAY IS "WHO'S THAT GUY?" AND "WILL HE GET ME A SANDWICH?"  (LAUGHTER)  BUT IT IS A GOOD POINT, HOW A  NATION AND ITS LEADERS REACT TO THREATS BOTH EXTERNAL AND  INTERNAL SAYS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT  THAT ADMINISTRATION'S VALUES AND  IDEALS. AND WHILE IT'S HARD TO JUDGE AN  ADMINISTRATION BY THE ACTIONS IT  SAYS IT WANTS TO TAKE BUT CAN'T, PERHAPS WE CAN LEARN SOMETHING  ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION FROM  THE ACTIONS IT SAYS IT WON'T TAKE BUT DOES AS WE SEE IN OUR  NEW SEGMENT "PRIORITIES U.S.A."  (LAUGHTER)  IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S SEARCH FOR LAW AND ORDER --  (LAUGHTER). -- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE  SHOW, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT --  THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT ITS VALUES.
A FREE PRESS IS ALSO  ESSENTIAL FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. JOURNALISTS SHOULD NOT BE AT  LEGAL RISK FOR DOING THEIR JOBS.
THE WAY TO MAKE GOVERNMENT  RESPONSIBLE IS TO HOLD IT  ACCOUNTABLE.
I WANT EVERYBODY TREATED  FAIRFULLY THIS COUNTRY. TRANSPARENCY AND THE RULE OF LAW  WILL BE THE TOUCHSTONES OF THIS  PRESIDENCY.
Jon: WHAT THE -- HE DIDN'T  EVEN SAY IT! ALL RIGHT, WELL, THOSE ARE  EXCELLENT VALUES. LET'S SEE HOW THOSE VALUES HAVE  BEEN EXPRESSED.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS  PROSECUTED MORE GOVERNMENT  OFFICIALS FOR ALLEGED LEAKS THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION BEFORE  IT.
Jon: HE DID BELIEVE IN  FREEDOM OF THE PERES. JUST NOT FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR  PEOPLE WHO MIGHT TALK TO THE  PRESS. AND ABOUT THAT FREEDOM OF THE  PRESS --
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS  SNOOPING ON JOURNALISTS.
THE FEDS HAVE TRACKED MORE  THAN 20 PHONE LINES USED BY THE  ASSOCIATED PRESS.
FOX NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON  CORRESPONDENT JAMES ROSEN, THE  F.B.I. NAMING HIM A CRIMINAL COCONSPIRATOR IN THE LEAK.
AGENTS MONITORED ROSEN'S  MOVEMENT MOVEMENTS IN AND OUT OF  THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THEY SEARCHED HIS PERSONAL E-MAILS  AND COMBED THROUGH HIS CELL  PHONE RECORDS.
Jon: BUT THAT'S JUST THEM  EXHIBITING THE VALUE OF  FAIRNESS! (LAUGHTER)  IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO AFTER  WHISTLE-BLOWERS, YOU ALSO GOT TO  GO AFTER THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR WHISTLES BLOWN! (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS NOT HOW I WANTED TO SAY  THAT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY, NATIONAL SECURITY IS  IMPORTANT AND I'M SURE THE FULL  COURT PERES ON THIS ROSEN CHARACTER, THIS ROSEN REPORTER  WAS IN THE SERVICE OF PROTECTING  SOME PRETTY PRETTY SENSITIVE  INFORMATION.
FOX NEWS REPORTERS JAMES  ROSEN VOWED WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO  PROTECT HIS SOURCE FOR A SCOOP HE GOT BACK IN 2009 REPORTING  THEN NORTH KOREA WOULD RESPOND  TO SANCTIONS WITH MORE NUCLEAR  TESTS. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S IT? THAT'S THE LEAK THEY NEEDED TO  QUASH? NORTH KOREA TO ANSWER SANCTIONS  WITH MORE NUCLEAR TESTS? NORTH KOREA ANSWERS EVERYTHING  WITH MORE NUCLEAR TESTS! THAT'S -- THEY HAVE A NUCLEAR  TEST-BASED ECONOMY! (LAUGHTER)  WHAT OTHER BIG JAMES ROSEN  SCOOPS ARE THREATENING NATIONAL  SECURITY? TURKEY THE COUNTRY DIFFERENT  FROM TURKEY THE BIRD! (LAUGHTER)  BABIES MAKE TERRIBLE SOUS CHEFS! JON STEWART IS JEWISH! (LAUGHTER)  NATIONAL SECURITY OVERREACH? WHAT OTHER GROUPS HAVE THE FEDS  PRIORITIZED FOR SCRUTINY?
COMPUTER HACKER WHO BROKE  INTO ONLINE ACCOUNTS OF  CHRISTINA AGUILERA SENTENCE MONDAY TO TEN YEARS IN PRISON.
MEDICAL MARIJUANA. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ARE RIGHT  NOW CRACKING DOWN ON LEGAL  DISPENSARIES.
A SECOND MAN ACCUSED OF  HACKING AT&T SERVERS AND  STEALING DATA NOW FACING CONSPIRACY AND IDENTITY THEFT  CHARGES.
THE F.B.I. GOING AFTER  HACKERS. MORE THAN 40 SEARCH WARRANTS ON  USPECTS WHO MAY HAVE HACKEDS  INTO MASTERCARD, VISA, AND  PAYPAL.
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND  PROSECUTORS SAY A HACKER USED  THE INFO SABOTAGE A STORY ON THE "L.A. TIMES" WEB SITE. HE COULD GET UP TO 25 YEARS IN  PRISON.
Jon: WHAT THE (BLEEP)? (LAUGHTER)  SO THAT'S WHAT THE D.O.J. IS UP  TO. THEY'RE GOING AFTER POT HEADS  AND HACKERS. BASICALLY IF YOU COULD BE PLAYED  IN THE MOVIE BY KEVIN SMITH --  (LAUGHTER). -- THE FEDS WOULD LIKE A WORD  WITH YOU. (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT. SO AT THIS POINT --  (APPLAUSE). AT THIS POINT ADMINISTRATION  PRIORITIES SEEM TO BE TILTED  TOWARDS UNUSUALLY HARSH PUNISHMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS  WHOSE CRIMES DON'T REALLY SEEM  TO MERIT THEM. HAVE THEY HAD ANYTHING TO OFFER  ON SLIGHTLY LARGER FISH?
LET ME MAKE IT VERY CLEAR  THAT THERE IS NO BANK, THERE'S  NO INSTITUTION, THERE'S NO INDIVIDUAL WHO CANNOT BE  INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED BY  THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE.
Jon: YES! THE INSTITUTIONS THAT NEARLY  BROKE THE WORLD. HOW'S THAT BANK PROSECUTION  GOING, BY THE WAY?
MORE THAN FOUR YEARS SINCE  THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008,  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS OF THINK SENIOR WALL STREET  EXECUTIVES.
Jon: NO ARRESTS. YOU SEE HOW SAD THAT MADE THE  VOICEOVER GUY? (LAUGHTER)  (AS VOICEOVER GUY)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS AS  ANYBODY! WHY NOT? WHY HAVEN'T YOU ARRESTED THOSE  GUYS? NONE OF THEM BOUGHT POT? AND IF THEY DIDN'T BUY POT  THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY BLEW  ALL THEIR MONEY ON COCAINE! (LAUGHTER)  WHY HAVEN'T YOU GONE AFTER THEM? WHAT ARE THEY TOO BIG TO JAIL?
LET ME BE VERY, VERY, VERY  CLEAR: BANKS ARE NOT TOO BIG TO  JAIL IF WE FIND A BANK OR A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT HAS  DONE SOMETHING WRONG, IF WE CAN  PROVE IT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, THOSE CASES WILL BE  BROUGHT.
Jon: BEAUTIFUL. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN HOLDER'S  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRODUCED A  30-PAGE DOCUMENT SAYING EXPLICITLY THAT IT COULD PROVE  BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT  H.S.B.C. VIOLATED FEDERAL MONEY LAWS BY FAILING TO MONITOR OVER  $220 TRILLION IN WIRE TRANSFERS  IT MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO -- STRIKE A DEAL ALLOWING THEM PAY  A FINE EQUAL TO ONE MONTH'S  PROFITS. SCARED STRAIGHT! (LAUGHTER)  SO THAT'S WHAT WE FIGURED OUT TO  DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE, TAX FRAUD. HAY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHAT  OUTSIDE EXPERTS TOLD YOU ABOUT  HOW MUCH DAMAGE PROSECUTING THESE BIG BANKS WOULD DO.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS  NOT RECEIVED ANY MATERIAL  INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE EXPERTS WHEN MAKING PROSECUTORIAL  DECISIONS IN CASES INVOLVING  LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
FIRST OF ALL --  (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  -- I AM SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO  LEAVE YOUR PROM TO COME TO DO  THIS. (LAUGHTER)  BUT SECOND OF ALL, SO THEY  DIDN'T EVEN GET INFORMATION  ABOUT WHAT TWO BIG TO JAIL EVEN  MEANS? TOO BIG TO JAIL WAS REALLY TOO  HARD TO KNOW? I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT  NOT ONE PERSON WENT TO PRISON  FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE WHOLE FINANCIAL CRISIS. ISN'T THERE ANYBODY? JUST ONE GUY?
CHARLIE ENGEL WENT TO PRISON  FOR HIS ROLE IN THE FINANCIAL  CRISIS.
Jon: WHAT IS WITH THE  (BLEEP)ING BOW TIE? (LAUGHTER)  I MEAN, THANK YOU. WHO IS CHARLIE ENGEL? WHAT IS HE SOME WALL STREET  WHEELER DEALER BIG-TIME BANKER?
HE DIDN'T WORK HERE ON WALL  STREET. HE WAS NOT A BIG-TIME BANKER. HE WAS CONVICTED OF DOING  SOMETHING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  OF OTHER AMERICANS LIKELY DID DURING THE HOUSING BOOM: HE  EXAGGERATED HIS INCOME ON HIS  MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS.
Jon: PRIORITIES U.S.A. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
