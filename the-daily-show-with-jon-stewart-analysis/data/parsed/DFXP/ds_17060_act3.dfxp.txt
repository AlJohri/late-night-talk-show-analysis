(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTS TONIGHT ARE FORMER NEWSPAPER REPORTERS. THEY CURRENTLY WORK AS POLITICAL OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS. THEIR NEW BOOK IS CALLED TWO INSIDERS WHO SEE THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICAN POLITICS. PLEASE WELCOME THEM TO THE SHOW. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HELLO, ALAN AND MICHAEL. COME AND SIT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. MY FIRST QUESTION IS, WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR? NOW, EVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'VE PUT IT OUT IN A PAPERBACK GIVES IT A SENSE OF INTRIGUE  AND C.I.A.-TYPE FREE. LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO PUT THIS IN A BAG AND THEN DELIVER IT TO SOMEBODY IN A PARK AND THEN  THEY READ IT. IT'S ALL VERY NERVE WRACKING. YOU'RE THE GUYS KNOW SHOW UP AT A LOCAL COURTHOUSE AND SAY, WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON SO-AND-SO?
EXACTLY.
Jon: DO YOU TELL THEM WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR?
THAT'S WHY WE CALL THE BOOK NOBODY. BECAUSE WHEN WE GO IN THERE AND START ASKING QUESTIONS USUALLY IT'S ABOUT A  POLITICIAN THEY KNOW. THEY ALREADY KNOW WHO IT IS. THEY'RE CURIOUS WHO WE'RE WITH. THEY ALWAYS SAY WHO ARE YOU WITH TO GET INFORMATION. WE ALWAYS SAY WE'RE WITH NOBODY. SOMETIMES I'LL SAY I'M WITH HIM. THAT SORT OF THROWS THEM.
Jon: IT GOES INTO ABBOTT AND COSTELLO TERRITORY PRETTY FAST.
NOSE DIVE.
Jon: NOW, DO THEY EVER IN THE MOVIES I IMAGINE YOU'D BE  WORKING AND YOU WOULD FIND THE FILE AND THEN THE MUSIC. THE JAWS MUSIC OR WHATEVER. THEY WOULD RUN TO THE PHONE AND THEN THE LOCAL SHERIFF WHO IS ON THE TAKE WOULD COME AND  YOU WOULD BE RUNNING FOR YOUR LIVES? WHAT IS IT IN REALITY?
WE USUALLY HAVE A COUPLE OF THUGS THAT FOLLOW US IN A PICK- UP TRUCK FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
Jon: IS THAT REALLY TRUE?
YEAH.
Jon: THUGS IN A PICK-UP TRUCK.
A RUSTY PICK-UP TRUCK.
Jon: THUGS IN A RUSTY PICK-UP TRUCK.
CORRECT.
Jon: WHY CAN'T THUGS BEAT UP ENOUGH PEOPLE TO BUY A BETTER TRUCK? REALLY SAD. DO YOU ONLY WORK FOR ONE... IN OPPOSITION RESEARCH, DO RESEARCHERS GENERALLY WORK FOR  ONE PARTY OR BOTH PARTIES?
ONE PARTY.
WE WORK FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
Jon: YOU DO. BUT YOUR COUNTERPART THEN WOULD WORK FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. DO YOU KNOW THEM?
NO. WE NEVER SEE THEM.
WE'LL WALK INTO A COURTHOUSE AND THE CLERK WILL SAY SOMEBODY WAS JUST HERE  ASKING FOR THAT SAME INFORMATION, KIND OF LIKE AN ALFRED HITCHCOCK THING.
Jon: THEY'RE LOOKING FOR DIRT ON THEIR OWN GUY?
YEAH BECAUSE WE LOOK FOR OUR GUY TOO BECAUSE IF YOU WERE RUNNING FOR OFFICE-- SGOD  FORBID-- (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I'M GOING TO MAKE YOUR LIVES MUCH EASIER. THERE'S A PICTURE OF ME AT A PARTY IN COLLEGE WITH MY BALLS  IN A TUB OF "I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER."  LET'S JUST END IT RIGHT THERE. SO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR GUY. WHAT IF YOU FIND SOMETHING DAMAGING ON YOUR GUY?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WIN ANY POPULARITY CONTEST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO IN AND  THEM THEM. YOU HOPE YOU DON'T. THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY US TO DO. WE LOOK AT OUR GUY JUST AS VIGOROUSLY AS WE DO OUR OPPONENT. SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO GO IN AND GIVE THEM THE NEWS THAT THERE'S SOME STUFF THERE  THAT'S NOT GOOD.
Jon: DO THEY EVER SAY TO YOU, BURY THIS? MAKE THIS GO AWAY? DO THEY EVER SAY IT IN THIS TONE OF VOICE? BURY THIS. MAKE THIS GO AWAY.
UNFORTUNATELY ONCE WE DIG IT UP WE CAN'T REALLY BURY IT AGAIN. IT'S ALREADY OUT THERE. SO, NO.
Jon: BUT DO THEY SAY SNIT.
YEAH, A COUPLE OF TIMES.
Jon: DO YOU GET>n-" TO DECIDE? YOUR GOAL IS BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY LIKE WE'RE JUST FINDING OUT THE TRUTH.
RIGHT.
Jon: BUT AS YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE LARGE THINGS ARE MANY SHADES OF GRAY. TO USE SOMETHING IN A POLITICAL AD, PEOPLE BEND THAT ALL THE TIME. DO YOU HAVE ANY SAY IN HOW THIS STUFF IS USED?
NOT GENERALLY. WE GET TO SEE WHEN IT GOES TO THE POLLSTER WE LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACCURATE. WHEN THE MEDIA GUYS RIGHT A SCRIPT WE MAKE SURE IT'S ACCURATE. FOR THE MOST PART OUR PART OF THE JOB IS DONE.
Jon: HAVE YOU DONE RESEARCH ON A CANDIDATE, 200 PAGES ON HIM. YOU THOUGHT TO YOURSELF PRETTY DECENT GUY BUT HERE'S THE ONE THING WE FOUND. I CAN'T SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO CRUSH HIM. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH... ANDSFU&lt;ï¿½ YOU WATCH THAT BEING DONE? HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT? LET'S JUST SAY SOUL WATCH.
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS. WE HAD A GUY THAT HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR THROWING A PIPE BOMB AT A HOME COMING FLOAT.
Jon: THAT WOULD NOT BE A SHADE OF GRAY. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT HAS DONE THE RIGHT THING, SEEMS LIKE AN UPSTANDING GUY. HAD SOMETHING IN HIS PAST THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ILLEGAL BUT CLEARLY IN THIS ELECTION WOULD  BE DAMAGING. WHAT DO YOU DO?
WE'RE STILL GOING TO TURN IT INTO THE CAMPAIGN BUT WE'RE  GOING TO BASICALLY TELL THEM THIS GUY LOOKS CLEAN OVERALL. IF YOU GO OUT THERE WITH THIS, THE ODDS ARE IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU LOOK BAD. THEY USUALLY DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS AFRAID OF THE BLOW-BACK  FROM GOING NEGATIVE. YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT TO WATCH TV.
Jon: IS THERE A LAIR UNDERNEATH YOU GUYS OF THE GUYS THAT WEAR THE GLOVES? AND CARRY 1920s WEAPONS AND DO THINGS LIKE THAT? LIKE IS THERE A LAIR LIKE BEYOND THE OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS THAT REALLY, WHERE YOU GET INTO THE....
I THINK WE'RE THE LAIR.
Jon: YOU'RE THE GUYS.
WE'RE THE BOTTOM LAIR.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS FOR BEING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL.
THANK YOU.
Jon: WE APPRECIATE IT. VERY WELL WRITTEN AND VERY ENTERTAINING. IF YOU WANT TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THIS STUFF OPERATES, A GREAT WAY TO DO IT. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. THANK YOU BOTH.
