Jon:  WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, NOBODY LIKES HOMELESSNESS. I'M VERY CONTROVERSIAL. LEAST OF ALL THE HOMELESS. BUT WHAT CAN BE DO DONE? SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH HAS A PLAN THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. HASAN MINHAJ REPORTS.
ACROSS AMERICA, NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ALLEVIATE HOMELESSNESS ARE BEING INTRODUCED, LIKE BANNING THE HOMELESS BECAUSE OF BODY ODOR. FINING THEM FOR SLEEPING OUTDOORS. AND ARRESTING THEM FOR SITTING DOWN. BUT SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH HAS TAKEN THE NEXT STEP BY REMOVING THE HOMELESS FROM THEIR STREETS ALL TOGETHER. SIR, HAVE YOU SEEN ANY HOMELESS PEOPLE?
NOPE.
HAVE YOU SEEN A SINGLE PERSON LIVING IN CARDBOARD BOX?
NO, SORRY.
WHERE THE HELL DID THEY PUT EVERYBODY? TO FIND OUT I SAT DOWN WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THIS INITIATIVE LLOYD PENDLETON.
WE HAVE REDUCED OUR CHRONIC HOMELESS COUNT BY 72% SINCE 2005.
DID YOU HIDE THEM UNDERGROUND?
WE DID NOT HIDE THE HOMELESS PEOPLE UNDERGROUND.
DID YOU CONVERT FROM MORMON TO GAY?
WE DID NOT CONVERT THEM FROM MORMON TO GAY OR GAY TO MORMON.
SO HOW DID THEY DO IT?
WE DID IT BY GIVING HOMES TO HOMELESS PEOPLE.
WHOSE -- YOU DID WHAT?
GAVE HOMES TO THE HOMELESS. YES, IT'S SIMPLE. YOU GIVE THEM HOUSING. AND YOU END HOMELESSNESS.
THAT'S RIGHT. AS PART OF PROGRAM CALLED HOUSING FIRST, SALT LAKE CITY IS JUST GIVING APARTMENTS TO THE HOMELESS. YOU GAVE A HOMELESS PERSON --
A HOME.
OKAY, SO YOU GAVE A HOME TO THE HOMELESS PERSON, BUT THAT STILL MAKES THEM HOMELESS.
NO. THEY'RE HOUSED. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE HOMELESS YOU DO NOT HAVE A HOME. THAT'S WHAT THE WORD MEANS.
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I SAW THE MOVIE "INTERSTELLAR" AND THAT MAKES MORE SENSE THAN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
WELL YOU MAY THINK IT MAY NOT BE ADDING UP, BUT IT ADDS UP TO US.
SURE. GIVING HOMELESS PEOPLE HOMES SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA, JUST LIKE FEEDING PEOPLE AND PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. BUT EVERYONE KNOWS WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT.
22% OF AMERICANS ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING SOME KIND OF GOVERNMENT ENTITLEMENT, THAT IS 67 MILLION PEOPLE. AND THE TRUTH IS, WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.
WHAT DO ALL OF THESE HANDOUTS COST THE GOOD HARD WORKING PEOPLE OF UTAH?
THESE HANDOUTS COSTS PROBABLY $12,000, $10,000-$12,000 PER PERSON HOUSED.
THERE YOU GO.
COMPARED WITH $20,000 A YEAR ON THE STREETS.
WAIT, WHAT?
WHAT WE GIVE THEM IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT THAN THE EMERGENCY SYSTEM, EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, EMT RUNS AND JAIL TIME.
BUT, I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST GIVING THEM A HOME.
YES.
OKAY, OKAY, SO IT MAKES FINANCIAL SENSE. BUT THE FACT IS IT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM LAZY.
THEY DISINCENTIVIZE YOU TO GET OFF WELFARE.
RIGHT.
ACTUALLY GO AND WORK.
I'LL GET MY RENT PAID, I'LL GET FOOD, WHY WOULD I WORK?
WHY WOULD I WORK WHEN THE GOVERNMENT PAYS ME NOT TO WORK?  WHY INDEED?
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING IS INCENTIVIZING MOOCHING.
WE DON'T SEE THEM AS MOOCHERS. WE SEE THEM AS PEOPLE IN GREAT NEED OF SOME SUPPORT TO FULFILL THEIR LIVES.
IT'S ALMOST ALMOST AS IF PENDLETON SEES THE POOR AND HOMELESS AS ACTUAL PEOPLE. THIS WAS GETTING COMPLICATED, SO I WENT TO VISIT ONE OF THESE MOOCHERS AND THEIR MOOCHATORIUM.
THIS APARTMENT HAS GIVEN ME A JOB. WITH THAT JOB I CAN MOVE BACK TO CHICAGO AND BE WITH MY SON, MY DAUGHTER, AND MY FAMILY.
DO YOU SEE HOW THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE? DOESN'T IT SEEM THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY DEPENDENT NOW ON FOUR WALLS AND HAVING A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD?
YES.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO WANT TO SLEEP ON CONCRETE EVER AGAIN.
WHY WOULD I WANT TO SLEEP ON CONCRETE? I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT WHEN I WAS OUT THERE.
BUT IF YOU JUST GIVE PEOPLE THESE APARTMENTS THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW EVERYONE IS GOING TO WANT TO BE POOR.
NO ONE WANTS TO BE POOR. EVERYBODY NEEDS A HAND SOMETIME.
THIS WAS GETTING A BIT CONFUSING. IF YOU'RE A POOR PERSON YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THIS. BUT THIS GUY HAS A JOB, AN APARTMENT, AND GENERAL SELF-ESTEEM.
THE IMAGE WE HAVE OF POOR PEOPLE AS STARVING AND LIVING IN SQUALOR REALLY IS NOT ACCURATE. MANY HAVE THINGS, 99% OF THEM HAVE A REFRIGERATOR. 81% HAVE A MICROWAVE. 78% HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.
WHAT? SO THEY'RE EATING FOOD THAT'S BEEN CHILLED? AND THEN HEATED? THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE US. RUSSELL, THEY GAVE YOU A PANINI PRESS?
I THINK I BOUGHT THAT.
NOW I'M TOTALLY LOST. WE HAVE GIVEN THEM A HOME. HE'S GOTTEN HIS LIFE BACK TOGETHER, HE'S BECOME A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY. AND IT'S COSTING US LESS?
SO, WHAT'S THE CATCH?
WHAT IS THE CATCH>
YES, THERE HAS TO BE A CATCH. IS THIS LIKE A HOMELESS TIME SHARES.
THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A TIME SHARE FEE EVERY YEAR, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. IT WORKS.
SO IF YOU SEE A HOMELESS PERSON DON'T FEEL BAD. KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET A SECOND SHOT AT LIFE. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS LIVE IN UTAH. [ Applause ]
Jon: HASAN MINHAJ. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
