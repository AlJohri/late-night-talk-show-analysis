Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, LIVING IN THE NEW YORK CITY WE'RE CONTINUALLY REMINDED OF WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM. WHETHER IT BE SHAKE SHACK OR SECOND AVENUE DELI. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT THE FOOD THAT YOU EAT COMES FROM SOMEPLACE BEFORE THAT? (LAUGHTER) AASIF MANDVI FILED THIS REPORT.
AMERICA'S HEARTLAND GROWS CROPS TO FEED THE WORLD. BUT WE OFTEN FORGET TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE WHO BRING US THIS BOUNTIFUL HARVEST YEAR AFTER YEAR. BIOTECH COMPANIES.
BIOTECH COMPANIES ARE REVOLUTIONIZING FARMING.
REALLY?
YES, THEY ARE HELPING TO PUT MORE FOOD ON TABLES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
FOR INSTANCE BIOTECH GIANT MONSANTO MAKES PATENTED GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS THAT RESIST HIGHLY TOXIC WEED KILLERS. WHICH THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO MAKE. BUT NOW THEIR TIME-HONORED WAY OF LIFE IS UNDER ATTACK.
SOMETIMES FARMERS ACT IN A MANNER THAT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE BIOTECHNOLOGY SEED COMPANY.
YES, BIG FARMER HAS FORCED MONSANTO TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THEM OVER 500 TIMES A YEAR.
MONSANTO LAWYERS ARE ACCUSING FARMERS OF VIOLATING THEIR PATENTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE DOING IT OR NOT.
MAYBE THEY DESERVE IT.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
BUT COME ON, THESE SEEDS ARE PATENTED.
ONE CASE I AM AWARE, TRUCKS DRIVING BY HIS FARM ON THE WAY TO THE ELEVATORS, THE SEEDS BLEW OFF HIS TRUCK INTO THE FIELD, HE WAS SUED BY MONSANTO.
MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BUILT HIS FARM DOWNWIND.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. IT COSTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO DEFEND AGAINST A PATENT-INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT. THEY BASICALLY FORCE TO US FALL INTO LINE WITH THEIR RULES.
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO DEVELOP SEEDS. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY GROW ON TREES.
ALL MONSANTO ASKS IS THAT GREEDY FARMERS PAY A YEARLY LICENSING FEE FOR NEW SEEDS RATHER THAN REUSE SEEDS FROM A PREVIOUS HARVEST, THE WAY THEY'VE DONE SINCE FARMING BEGAN.
MONSANTO PATENTING OUR PLANTS IS A THEFT OF OUR GENETIC HERITAGE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD PATENT YOUR GENETIC HERITAGE AND THEN THEY CAN'T PATENT THE PATENT OF GENETIC HERITAGE.
SEE THAT'S WHY PATENT LAWYERS ARE SO VITAL. THEY'VE DONE WHAT FARMERS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO. COLLECT ROYALTIES ON NATURE.
YOU CAN PATENT ANYTHING?
NO.
I MEAN YOU CAN PATENT SEEDS.
THAT'S TRUE.
CAN YOU PATENT AIR?
NOT AWARE OF ANY PATENTS ON AIR.
NO, CAN YOU PATENT THIS --
THAT IS NOT PATENT ELIGIBLE IT HAS TO BE NOVEL AND NONOBVIOUS.
CAN I GET A PATENT ON THAT?
HIGHLY UNLIKELY.
IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD THING. LOOK, SEE THAT, LADIES?
EVEN IF YOU DID, IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE.
BUT NOT DIFFICULT FOR OUR HEROIC PATENT ATTORNEYS, CONSIDERING WHAT THEY'VE HELPED MONSANTO ACHIEVE.
MONSANTO'S LAWYERS ARE PROFESSIONALS. THIS IS ALL THEY DO IS SUE FARMERS. THAT'S HOW THEY'VE GAINED A 93% MARKET SHARE.
THEY HAVE A 93% MARKET SHARE?
93%.
YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF SUING TO GET THAT KIND OF MARKET SHARE. I MEAN THIS IS BACKBREAKING WORK THEY'RE DOING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GROWING FOOD.
BIG DEAL. AND ANY HIPSTER CAN GROW FOOD. YOU CAN GROW TOMATOES ON A ROOFTOP IN WILLIAMSBURG. DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF SKILL.
IT TOOK FIVE GENERATIONS TO GET TO THIS POINT, TO ACCUMULATE WHAT WE HAVE.
AND YOU KNOW, BIOTECH PATENT LAW HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 1985.
IT'S TIME TO HONOR THESE UNSUNG HEROES.
IT'S MORNING AGAIN IN AMERICA'S FIRMS. SOMEWHERE TODAY A LAW FIRMER IS TOSSING ON HIS BROOKS BROTHERALS AND WORKING HARD IN THE FIELD TO UNCOVER CASES OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT, DOING THE FAXING, PROOFREADING, REDACTING AND LITIGATING THAT NO ONE ELSE IN AMERICA SEEMS TO HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO ANY MORE. IT'S A TOUGH JOB. BUT IT HAS ITS REWARDS. A LOT OF REWARDS. IN FACT, IT'S MOSTLY REWARDS. IT'S THE KIND OF WORK THAT MAKES A BOY LOOK INTO HIS FATHER'S SMILING EYES AND SAY DAD, SOME DAY I WANT TO [BLEEP] OVER A FARMER. JUST LIKE YOU DO.
THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN NO WAY REFLECT THOSE OF THE DAILY SHOW. MONSANTO, PLEASE DON'T SUE US
