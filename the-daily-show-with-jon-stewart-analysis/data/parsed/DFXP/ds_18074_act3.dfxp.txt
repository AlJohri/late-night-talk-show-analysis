MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  GOOD ONE. EMMY WINNER, THE GAME OF THRONES  NOW ABOUT TO PREMIERE ITS THIRD  SEASON.
IT'S NOT SLANDER IF IT'S  TRUE.
WHAT IS THE TRUTH YOU PLAN ON  TELLING HIM TODAY?
WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS ABOUT  WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY TO FATHER
BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU TELL LIES ABOUT ME.
ANY LIES IN PARTICULAR? YOU'RE A CLEVER MAN. NOT HALF AS CLEVER AS YOU THINK  YOU ARE
STILL MAKES ME MORE CLEVER  THAN YOU.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW. PETER DINKLAGE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND? I AM GOOD. Jon: PEOPLE... FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO  MIDDLE EARTH
Jon: EXACTLY. FANTASY TO FANTASY. BAM! PEOPLE ARE SO OBSESSED WITH THIS  PROGRAM. I HAVE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE IN  THIS OFFICE WHO DISAPPEAR FOR  DAYS ON "GAME OF THRONE" JAGS, AND THEY JUST COME BACK WITH  THAT SORT OF CAN'T-WAIT. YOU JUST COINED SOMETHING, SIR. IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE NERD  GLAZE DOT-COM RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO REGISTER THAT.
MIDDLE EAST TO MIDDLE EARTH. NERD GLAZE. LET'S KEEP GOING
Jon: I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE. THIS IS LIKE THE BEST EVER. THIS IS NICE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHERE DO THEY FILM THIS TO GET  THESE BEAUTIFUL...
JERSEY. (LAUGHING)  THE MOUNTAINS OF JERSEY.
Jon: (LAUGHING)  OCCASIONALLY WE GO TO A LAND  CALLED CONNECTICUT. WE SHOOT IN NORTHERN IRELAND,  MOROCCO, ICELAND, CROATIA, THE  MOON. YEAH.
Jon: WOW. WHAT'S BEEN THE FAVORITE SO FAR  FOR YOU, IN TERMS OF...
WE'RE BASED IN NORTHERN  IRELAND FOR THE MOST PART. THAT'S WHERE OUR STUDIO IS. BEAUTIFUL. IT'S GORGEOUS.
Jon: I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE. I'VE NOT BEEN TO ANY PLACE THAT  YOU MENTIONED YET IT SOUNDS  EXCITING.
WE'RE SORT OF RUNNING OUT OF  PLACES TO SHOOT.
Jon: ARE YOU FOLLOWED BY  THE... DOES THE TOWN KNOW WHEN  GAME OF THRONES IS IN TOWN AND THEY ALL...
THEY DON'T CARE. I THINK ONLY IN AMERICA DO WE  HAVE LIKE THE "US WEEKLY,"
Jon: THERE'S NO NERD GLAZE  OVERSEAS. THERE HAS TO BE A EUROPEAN NERD  GLAZE. EGG-BASED FRENCH. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT  THEY DO WITH THAT. I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT WHEN  YOU'RE FILMING THIS, THEY KEEP  YOU IN CASTLES JUST TO KEEP... OR IS THERE LIKE YOU COME FROM A  RESIDENCE INN AND THEY PUT THE  WHOLE THING TOGETHER AND BOOM.
WE ARE CALLED BY A RAIN. BY A RAVEN.
Jon: IT'S ALL JUST A BIG... ARE THERE REAL WIZARDS ON SET? IT'S THE WHOLE THING. DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS.
BRING ME MY LATTE. THAT'S THE NAME OF MY RAVEN.
Jon: DID YOU THINK I DIDN'T  KNOW THAT? COME ON. I'M A FAN. THE WHOLE THING NOW THOUGH IS  NOW TO COME BACK INTO THE WORLD  OF MORTALS AND NONBEHEADINGS AND ALL THAT, HAVE YOU FELT LIKE  YOU'VE GONE NATIVE IN THIS  MEDIEVAL WORLD? ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE IN THIS  WORLD WITHOUT MEAD? AND SOMEBODY BRINGS YOU OATMEAL  AND YOU'RE LIKE REALLY OATMEAL,  WHERE'S MY POUR RIDGE?
THE MEAL OF THE OAT. IT'S HARD TO BE BACK
Jon: BACK IN THE WORLD  IN NEW YORK CITY, YES. NO. WHAT IS THE QUESTION? MY LIFE IS VERY DIFFICULT
Jon: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO  DO. I HATE TO BRING THIS UP. MY KIDS ARE GOING TO MAYBE COME  AND SEE YOU. YOU'RE DOING THIS KIDS THINGS  OVER AT 52nd STREET PROJECT.
RIGHT THERE. Jon: 52nd STREET. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YES, IT'S THIS GREAT THAT A  GENTLEMAN GUS ROGERS IS ARTISTIC  DIRECTOR OF. THEY GET A BUNCH OF REALLY GOOD  ACTORS AND THEN MYSELF TO APPEAR  IN SHOWS THAT THESE 10-YEAR-OLDS  WRITE. THEY'RE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
Jon: IT'S AWESOME. I'VE BEEN A PART OF THAT A  COUPLE TIMES UNTIL THE  10-YEAR-OLDS DECIDED THAT I  COULDN'T ACT.
APPARENTLY LEWIS BLACK  TEACHES COMEDY.
Jon: LEWIS BLACK TEACHES  COMEDY TO CHILDREN
I REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT  Jon: 10-YEAR-OLDS LOOK AT HIM  LIKE THIS. THE THIRD SEASON OF GAME OF  THRONES, NOT ON GIVE ANYTHING  AWAY BUT YOUR FAMILY DOES WIN AND YOU BECOME KING. AND THE DRAGONS RETURN.
OH, I KNOW SO MUCH. Jon: DO YOU REALLY? JUST GIVE ME ONE LITTLE GIBLET.
WE GET A DRIVE-THROUGH... Jon: OH, HE'S LYING TO YOU. THE THIRD SEASON GAME OF THRONES  PREMIERES ON HBO SUNDAY
