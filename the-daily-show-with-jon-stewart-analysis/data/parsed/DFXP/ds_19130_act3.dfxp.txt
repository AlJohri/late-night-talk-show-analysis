[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK. MY GUST TONIGHT, A NEW FILM IS CALLED "MAGIC IN THE MOONLIGHT."
AND WHEN, WHEN YOU CONTACT THE SPIRITS, WILL WE BE ABLE TO SEE THE SOULS, AND HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM GHOSTS? OR ARE THEY GHOSTS?
I SHOULD THINK SOULS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT?
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF ECTOPLASM?
ECTOPLASM. NOW ISN'T THAT A MILKY SUBSTANCE RATHER LIKE YOGURT?
YOU ARE A JOKER, AREN'T YOU?
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE YOGURT, BUT IT WILL BE HER FORMER HUSBAND?
PLEASE WELCOME EMMA STONE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S HAPPENING.
Jon: NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL.
COOL.
Jon: EVERYBODY'S VERY EXCITED TO HAVE EMMA STONE IN THE HOUSE.
REALLY?
Jon: EMMA STONE'S KIND OF... YOU HAVE CREATED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Jon: I'M TALKING ABOUT EVEN AMONGST THE STAFF. LIKE SOMETIMES THERE'S, WE'LL HAVE A GUEST ON AND THEY'LL BE LIKE DO YOU KNOW WHO IS ON TONIGHT. I'LL SAY THE NAME OF THE GUEST, AND THEY'LL BE LIKE, YEAH, THAT'S NICE.
DO YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF MADE ME A SCARF?
Jon: MADE YOU A SCARF?
YEAH. LIKE KNITTED...
Jon: WAIT. OUT OF WHAT?
KNITTED ME A SCARF OUT OF BABY ALPACA WOOL.
Jon: WOW.
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND I TEARED UP AFTER SHE LEFT.
Jon: WOW.
SO I'M GOING TO GO BACKSTAGE AND SAY THANKS. HAS SHE EVER MADE YOU A SCARF?
Jon: NO. I'VE BEEN HERE 16 YEARS.
OK.
Jon: BABY ALPACKA. WELL, OK. I ONCE HAD A GUY, IT LOOKED LIKE I GUESS LIZARD SKIN, MADE LIKE A, IT WAS LIKE, IT WAS LIKE A BALL, FOUND IT UNDER HIS DESK. THAT'S REALLY NICE. I ACTUALLY KNOW WHO THAT IS.
YEAH.
Jon: THAT'S... THAT'S BETH.
THAT'S BETH.
Jon: SHE MAKES BEAUTIFUL SCARVES. SOMETIMES SHE MAKES HATS.
IT'S A GORGEOUS INFINITY SCARF THAT YOU CAN WRAP AROUND YOUR NECK AND KEEP YOU WARM FOREVER.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH. THAT'S NOT EASY, THE SCARF IS A VERY DELICATE THING TO PULL OFF.
KNITTING IN GENERAL IS A VERY DELICATE THING TO PULL OFF.
Jon: OH, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING IT. I WAS EVEN TALKING ABOUT WEARING IT.
NO, FOR A MAN, IT'S COMPLICATED.
Jon: YES. IT'S COMPLICATED.
IT'S COMPLICATED. YOU COULD THROW A SCARF ON WITH PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING, I THINK, AS A, AS A... YOU KNOW, I COULD BE WEARING A SCARF RIGHT NOW. IF YOU WORE A SCARF RIGHT NOW...
Jon: I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF, IT'S THE ONE THING MISSING FROM YOUR OUTFIT.  [LAUGHTER] DO YOU LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A SCARF, BECAUSE A GENTLEMAN IN A SCARF, UNLESS HE IS, IF I MAY, A BON VIVANT...
RIGHT.
Jon: HE MAY NOT BE LIKE A, LIKE A, WHAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF A BON VIVANT, A SHORT JEW. LET'S SAY HE'S A SHORT JEW, YOU DON'T PULL IT OFF AS DASHINGLY. IT'S A DASHING ACCESSORY.
IT GIVES THE SUGGESTION OF BON VIVANT.
Jon: YEAH. RIGHT.
IF YOU CHOOSE TO WEAR A SCARF, YOU MUST SOMEWHERE IN YOU BE SLIGHTLY A OR KNOW A BON VIVANT. IS IT JUST YOU ARE BON VIVANT OR A BON VIVANT?
Jon: A BON VIVANT.
A BON VIVANT.
HERE'S WHY I WOULD WEAR IT. I WORRY ABOUT TONSILLITIS. SO OTHER, THERE ARE OTHER... THERE IS A FUNCTION IT TO, AS WELL.
JUST KEEPING EVERYTHING WARM.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I USED TO WEAR... THIS WILL REALLY BE... I USED TO WEAR THE TURTLENECK. [LAUGHTER] I JUST WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN CATCH THAT ON THE CLOSE-UP. THE FACE SHE MADE, LIKE THAT MADE HER NAUSEOUS. THAT. RIGHT THERE. BOOM! WHAT IS, LET ME ASK YOU THIS ON A PURELY... THIS IS ANTHROPOLOGICAL OR SOCIOLOGICAL, ON A DATE, LIKE A FIRST DATE, THE WORST THING THAT A GUY HAS EVER WORN OR THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED, THE WORST THING TO WEAR WHEN JOINING A YOUNG LADY ON DATE, WOULD SCARF BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WOULD BIT SOMETHING LIKE THAT, LIKE A PORK PIE HAT? WHAT WOULD BE THE WORST THING, THE PORK PIE...
OH, THE PORK PIE HAT. PROBABLY NOT, NOT A SHIRT.
Jon: SO IF YOU'RE SAYING, IF SOMEBODY GOES BIG YOU, DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THAT?
I THINK MAYBE A NOT SHIRT.
Jon: HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS OR YOU?
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S EVER SHOWN BE UP WITH A NOT SHIRT ON.
Jon: YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST WRITE IN MAGIC MARKER, I'M A BRO. JUST ON YOUR THING.
FULL BRO, DUDE.
Jon: ON ALL THIS STUFF. WHICH, BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT MOVIE.
OK. THE MOVIE IS... YOU'VE FILMED IT.
YES. WITH CAMERAS AND...
Jon: THEY DID THE WHOLE THING. THEY EDITED IT. AND NOW IT'S OUT. IT'S ALWAYS, LISTEN, WOODY ALLEN'S FILMS, I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T EVEN DISCUSS IT ANYMORE BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH IT, BUT ALWAYS ENTERTAINING FILMS, ALWAYS PROLIFIC AND VERY GOOD.
YES. YES.
Jon: WAS IT ENJOYABLE TO PERFORM IT?
IT WAS.
Jon: THE GENTLEMAN YOU'RE PERFORMING WITH, COLIN FIRTH...
COLIN FIRTH.
Jon: HAS BEEN ON THE PROGRAM MANY TIMES. THERE'S A GUY WHO CAN WEAR A SCARF.
HE LOVES YOU AND THIS SHOW SO MUCH. HE CAN PULL OFF PRETTY MUCH, HE COULD WEAR A NOT SHIRT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THAT HURTS. THAT HURTS A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT ME, I'M GONNA SAY THIS, I'M NOT TRYING TO TOOT MY OWN HORN, I'M NOT TRYING TO COME ON, I'M JUST SAYING THIS, I COULD GET AWAY WITH NOT WEARING A SHIRT, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY, MY BODY IS SO HAIRY, THAT I WOULD COME IN AND YOU WOULD JUST THINK LIKE, OH, MINK, THAT'S AN INTERESTING CHOICE. SO THAT...
IT'S PERPETUAL BODY SCARF.
Jon: LET'S SEE THE NAUSEOUS FACE AGAIN. IF I CAN GET THE NAUSEOUS FACE AGAIN. YEAH, THAT'S NOT GOOD. NOW, YOU'RE LIVING IN THE CITY NOW?
I'M LIVING IN THE CITY. I'M LIVING IN THE CITY AND I'M AROUND.
Jon: YOU'RE AROUND.
I'LL RUN INTO YOU.
Jon: PROBABLY RUN IN. AND THEN WE CAN PRETEND WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER.
YEAH. [LAUGHTER]
I THINK THAT'S HAPPENED TO US ONCE BEFORE.
Jon: THAT DID HAPPEN ONCE.
THAT DID HAPPEN.
Jon: I RAN INTO HER AND A GENTLEMAN WITH A DOG AND I WAS LIKE, HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON. I REMEMBER THAT, AND THEN I THOUGHT, OH, I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY DOG AND THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE LOOKED LIKE A CRAZY PERSON YELLING. SO DID I EVER APOLOGIZE FOR THAT?
APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT, FOR RUNNING IN.
Jon: FOR ACCOSTING YOU ON THE STREET WHEN YOU HAD A DOG WITH YOU.
I DON'T THINK YOU ACCOSTED US ON THE STREET.
Jon: YOU DON'T THINK? WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY.
I WOULD NEVER THINK THAT YOU SAYING HI WOULD BE ACCOSTING.
Jon: I'M SORRY.
YOU...
Jon: NO, DON'T EVEN... I'M GOING TO KNIT YOU A WHOLE OUTFIT.
YOU... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: "MAGIC IN THE MOONLIGHT" IT'S IN THE SELECT CITIES JULY 25th. OPENS EVERYWHERE IN AUGUST 15th. AS ALWAYS, SO PLEASING. EMMA STONE, THANK YOU.
