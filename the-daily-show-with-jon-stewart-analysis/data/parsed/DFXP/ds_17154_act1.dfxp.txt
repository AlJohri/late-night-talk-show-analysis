Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW, MY NAME IS JON  STEWART. WE HAVE A FINE ONE TONIGHT,  OUR GUEST TONIGHT, PRESIDENT  BILL CLINTON WILL BE JOINING  US  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HE IS FROM WHAT I AM BEING  TOLD RIGHT NOW JUST WRAPPING  UP HIS PIECE AT THE  DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. HE'LL BE HERE, I MAKE JOKES  FOR A LIVING.
FIRST, BIG, BIG, BIG  NEWS.
NEW EVIDENCE FROM AN  ANCIENT TEXT THAT SUGGESTS  JESUS MAY HAVE BEEN MARRIED. JESUS WAS MARRIED, THAT IS  SOME PURE, UNCUT SITCOM  BAIT. HE CAN RAISE THE DEAD BUT  HEAVEN HELP HIM WHEN HE  FORGETS TO PUT DOWN THE  TOILET SEAT. KEVIN JAMES IS JESUS IN THE  KING OF KINGS. (APPLAUSE)  HANG ON HERE, THAT WOULD BE  A GOOD SHOW. UNLESS HE'S GOING TO TAKE IT  ON STAGE. WATER WALKING, RESURRECTED  SON OF GOD WAS MARRIED. WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE?
THIS MATTERED PIECE OF  PAPYRUS MAY LOOK LIKE A  DISCARDED BUSINESS CARD.
Jon: LET ME INTERRUPT YOU  RIGHT THERE. (LAUGHTER)  IN WHAT WORLD DOES THAT LOOK  LIKE A DISCARDED BUSINESS  CARD? PHYSICALS IT'S A BUSINESS  CARD FOR AN ARC BUILDER,  MAYBE. BUT IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE  A TATTERED PIECE OF PAPYRUS. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY SOMETHING  IN THE VOICE OVER AND EXPECT  TO US GO ALONG WITH IT IN  THE OFF CHANCE THAT OUR EYES ARE CLOSED. IT'S REALLY... SORRY W WHAT  IS THE EVIDENCE.
A HARVARD SCHOLAR HAS  JUST REVEALED THAT A FADED  PIECE OF PAPYRUS WRITTEN IN  THE COPTIC LANGUAGE 400 YEARS AFTER JESUS DIED  CONTAINED THE PHRASE, JESUS  SAID TO THEM, MY WIFE.
THAT WORD, THAT PHRASE,  JESUS SAID, MY WIFE, IS CUT  OFF. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WAIT, THAT'S IT? A PIECE OF PAPYRUS 400 YEARS  AFTER THE LIFE OF JESUS THAT  HAS THE TWO WORDS "MY WIFE"  AND THEN JUST ENDS. THAT'S YOUR PROOF. WELL, LET ME SEE IF I CAN  FILL THAT SENTENCE OUT FOR  YOU. JESUS SAID MY WIFE, IF I  EVER FIND ONE, WILL REALLY  HAVE TO LIKE THAI FOOD. OR HOW ABOUT THIS. MY WIFE, QUESTION MARK, NO,  I'M NOT MARRIED. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT WOULD REAL LIFE BRICK  TAMMBLIN SAY ABOUT THIS  NEWS.
DID YOU KNOW THIS  STUNNING CLAIM, JESUS HAD A  WIFE? HUH? THE STUNNING NEW ARTIFACT  JUST UNCOVERED WILL BRING  YOU THAT INFORMATION.
LUCKY LADY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT'S WITH THE  VEGAS WAYNE NEWTON CABARET  MATTER ABOUT THE MARRIAGE OF  JESUS. HEY, FOLKS, HOW ABOUT A HAND  FOR THESE TWO NEWLY-WED  NAZARENES, HUH, JESUS YOOIS  AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SWEETHEART, YOU'RE A LUCKY  LADY, ALL RIGHT. MOVING ON NOW. (LAUGHTER)  HEY, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN  SOME HONEYMOON, HUH,  GRETCHEN, HUH? HEY. MOVING ON TO OUR MAIN STORY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR  VETERANS, 11%. 3% HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL  POPULATION. LUCKILY THE SENATE TODAY HAS  TAKEN UP A BILL THAT WOULD  HELP GET JOBS FOR THE OVER  700,000 VETERANS CURRENTLY OUT OF WORK.
ON CAPITOL HILL  LEGISLATION AIMED AT PUTTING  THE NATION'S VETERANS BACK  TO WORK HAS BEEN BLOCKED IN THE SENATE.
Jon: OH, RIGHT, I FORGOT. IT'S TIME FOR OUR RECURRING  SEGMENT, OH, RIGHT, BECAUSE  DOING SOMETHING WOULD HAVE  THE... YES, THE SENATE VOTED ON A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE  A BILLION DOLLARS TO VETERANS,  A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE A  BILLION DOLLARS TO VETERANS TO HELP THEM GET JOBS IN LAW  ENFORCEMENT, FIRE  DEPARTMENTS AND OR FEDERAL  LAND. THE BILL WAS AFFIRMED BY 58  SENATORS, REJECTED BY ONLY  40, THUS FAILING TO PASS  BECAUSE APPARENTLY IN SENATE WORLD 58 TO 40 IS A LOSING  SCORE AND YOU EAT OUT OF  YOUR ANUS AND [BLEEP] OUT OF  YOUR EARS. (LAUGHTER)  LEADING THE CHARGE AGAINST  AMERICA'S FIGHTING MEN,  OKLAHOMA SENATOR TOM COBURN  WHO OPPOSES ON GROUNDS OF FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.
IF, IN FACT, WE'RE GOING  TO START ADDRESSING THE  BIGGER ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF  THIS COUNTRY, YOU GOT TO QUIT PLAYING FELONIOUS  ACCOUNTING WITH WHAT YOU ARE  DOING, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT  THAT BILL DID. IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME KIND  OF, PARDON MY WORD, CRAP  THAT CONGRESS HAS DONE FOR  YEARS.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THIS BILL IS FELONIOUS CRAP! (LAUGHTER)  BY THE WAY, ALSO THE NAME OF  MY JAZZ FUSION BAND BACK IN  HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS... THE SENATOR... YEAH. HERE IS THE SAD PART. THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN LAST  YEAR. THE SENATOR AND SOME OF HIS  COLLEAGUES FELT THAT THE  PROPOSED METHODS OF PAYING  FOR THIS BILL IMPOSING PENALTIES ON MEDICARE  PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN  DELINQUENT ON TAXES WAS A  LESS THAN SOLID FISCAL  FOUNDATION. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, I'M  JUST SPIT BALLING HERE, HOW  DID WE PAY FOR THE ACTUAL  WARS THAT MADE THESE INDIVIDUALS VETERANS WHO NOW  NEED JOBS?
ENGAGING IN ACCOUNTING  GIMMICKS OVER THE YEARS  LEAVING BIG TICKET ITEMS  LIKE WAR SPENDING OUT OF OFFICIAL BUDGETS.
Jon: OH, RIGHT! BY NOT PAYING FOR THEM! (LAUGHTER)  AT ALL! WE DIDN'T EVEN PUT THE WARS  ON LAY AWAY AND PAY THEM  DOWN A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME. ONLY TAKING THE WARS HOME  WHEN WE WERE DONE WITH THEM. OF COURSE! WE COULD HAVE FUNDED IT,  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG  FOR AMERICA. OBVIOUSLY SENATOR COBURN WAS  NOT IN THE SENATE WHEN THE  WAR BEGAN BUT I'M SURE THE  MINUTE HE GOT THERE HE BROUGHT THE FISCAL INTEGRITY  HE IS FAMOUS FOR TO EVEN THE  SUPPLEMENT WAR FUNDING  BILLS.
THE CONGRESS HAS TAKEN A  VACATION WHILE WE HAVEN'T  PASSED THE SUPPLEMENT FOR  OUR TROOPS. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUGHT TO  BE OUTRAGED THAT WE WOULD  LEAVE HERE BEFORE WE'VE  TAKEN CARE OF OUR TROOPS. I THINK IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE.
Jon: WHAT KIND OF  FELONIOUS CRAP...   (LAUGHTER)  SO ONCE AGAIN, $800 BILLION  UNFUNDED FOR WAR, A BILLION DOLLARS, BUT PAID FOR IN A  WAY YOU AREN'T CRAZY ABOUT  TO HELP THE GUYS WHO FOUGHT  THE WAR GET JOBS AFTERWARDS, WE'RE NOT MADE OUT OF MONEY,  PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY... OH, RIGHT,  BECAUSE DOING SOMETHING  WOULD HELP THE... WE'LL BE
