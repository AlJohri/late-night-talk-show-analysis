FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. THIS IS JON STEWART FOR NEWS 12. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ROBERT REICH. LET'S TURN OVERSEAS. A WEEK AGO JUST ONE WEEK-- SEVEN-- SEVEN DAYS IT SEEMED THE ONLY WAY THAT THESE UNITED STATES MIGHT AVOID WAR WITH SYRIA WAS THROUGH OUR USUAL SEMANTIC SHENANIGANS. WE WOULD BOMB THEM BUT WE WOULD CALL IT A FREEDOM PLAY DATE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. BUT OVER THE WEEKEND THE WINDS OF WAR SHIFTED DRAMATICALLY.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY AND RUSSIA'S TOP DIPLOMAT COULD END SYRIA WEAPONS PROGRAM. THEY SEALED A DEAL IN GENEVA ONE THAT COULD LEAVE SYRIA WITH NO CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR.
WE-- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! WE PULLED IT-- WE MANAGED NOT TO HAVE A WAR WITH SOMEBODY? I DONE-- YOU DON'T GET A WAR. AND YOU DON'T GET A WAR! YOU DON'T GET A WAR! EVERYBODY DOESN'T GET A WAR! YOU DON'T GET A WAR. WAIT, YOU SEEM UPSET ABOUT NOT GETTING A WAR.
-- I'LL GET ONE. I'LL GET A WAR--  (LAUGHTER) SO WE GET TO TAKE ASSAD'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS. WE DON'T HAVE TO KILL ANYONE. AND WE DID IT ALL JUST BY THE TALKY TALK. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE THAT.
IT MEANS NOTHING SO THIS IS A DEBACLE. (LAUGHTER)
JON: THIS IS A DEBACLE. I HAVE NOT SEEN A DISASTER SUCH AS THIS SINCE I ARRIVED AT THE BEAUREGARD COTILLION WITH A MAGNOLIA IN MY HAIR WHEN EVERYONE ELSE WAS WEARING ORCHIDS. I MEAN-- TALK ABOUT A DEBACLE! (LAUGHTER) GRAHAM! WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE NO WAR FOR AN ANSWER?
THE REASON I WANTED TO STRIKE ASSAD IS TO PUNISH HIM-- .
Jon: I WANTED TO SEE HIM SQUIRM. (LAUGHTER) I WANTED TO TIE ASSAD UP AND SPANK HIS TAUT--  HIS TAUT SYRIAN-- I'M GETTING THE VAPORS. I MUST BE-- OH LORD! (APPLAUSE) ANYWAY--  (LAUGHTER)
YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT IT IN MY NEW BOOK 50 SHADES OF GRAHAM! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY GOODNESS. (LAUGHTER) I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT ONE MAN SHOW ON THE ROAD. (LAUGHTER) LINDSEY GRAHAM ISN'T ALONE IN FEELING THAT THIS SUCCESSFUL USE OF DIPLOMACY TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL IS THE WORST DEFEAT IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS A GOOD OUTCOME FOR ANYBODY.
I THINK IT'S A LOSER.
IT ENDS UP BEING A HANDOFF TO VLADIMIR PUTIN. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A FIASCO LIKE THIS FROM A U.S. PRESIDENT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT AM I MISSING?
WE MIGHT CONTAIN A DICTATOR'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCKPILE WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN THE PROCESS OR INVADING A COUNTRY AND CREATING-- THERE'S ONLY TWO EXPLANATIONS FOR HOW THIS FELLA THERE  HAS NEVER SEEN A FIASCO LIKE THIS FROM A U.S. PRESIDENT, A, HE'S ONLY SIX MONTHS OLD. HE'S ONE OF THOSE BENJAMIN BUTTON TYPE DUDES. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE I'M A BABY. OR B, YOU WORKED FOR REAGAN. NEVER SEEN A FIASCO LIKE THIS.
IRAN CONTRA. OR B HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORD FIASCO MEANS, WHAT? A THREE SOME WITH HOT GIRLS RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M SUPPOSED TO GO COLLECT MY LOTTERY WINNINGS. WHAT A FIASCO. (LAUGHTER) ARE THOSE GIRLS STOCK FOOTAGE, LISTEN TO ME. THE ONLY THING-- ONLY HAD TO CHANGE ONE LETTER. THE ONLY THING THAT THEY LIKE LESS THAN THAT WE'RE NOT BOMBING NOW IS THAT WE MIGHT NOT BOMB.
IT APPEARS THAT THE THREAT OF FORCE HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF THE TABLE.
I THINK THAT IT DOES TAKE THE USE OF AMERICAN FORCE PRETTY MUCH OFF THE TABLE.
I THINK THE ARMED RESPONSE REALLY IS OFF THE TABLE.
IT'S NOT OFF THE TABLE. THE ARMED RESPONSE IS NEVER OFF THE TABLE.
Jon: WHO BELIEVES THE ARMED RESPONSE IS OFF THE TABLE. THIS IS AMERICA. HAVE YOU SEEN THE TABLE? (LAUGHTER) BUT LOOK, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANTED TO BOMB SYRIA AND WERE SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO BOMB SYRIA ARE NOW ALSO UPSET WE'RE  NOT BOMBING SYRIA.
RIGHT NOW OBAMA IS FORTUNATELY NOT FIGHTING IN SYRIA BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, BUT OBAMA IS GIVING UP A VERY BIG LEADERSHIP ROLE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE TALKING TO THE RUSSIANS INSTEAD OF BOMBING THE SYRIANS. BUT SOME OF THE RHETORIC HAS BEEN ALMOST LAUGHABLE.
I WOULD VOTE AGAINST AN AUTHORIZATION TO USE FORCE HERE.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PRESIDENT PUTS HIMSELF IN A SITUATION HE HAS NOT THOUGHT THROUGH WHEN HE FLIP-FLOPS,  HE DITHERS. HE MOVES BACK AND FORTH, HE SHOWS WEAKNESS AND INDECISIVENESS.
YOU WOULD NEVER CATCH GEORGE W. BUSH DITHERING. (LAUGHTER) YOU NEVER CATCH GEORGE W. BUSH DITHERING INTO A NON CONFRONTATION. (APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW? THESE GUYS PREFER BUSH, INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY IS LIKE A GLORY HOLE. YOU JUST STICK IT IN AND WORRY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES LATER. (LAUGHTER) SORRY, I WAS RAISED AT A NEW JERSEY REST AREA. DO THE HAWKS HAVE ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT OUR POSSIBLE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION ON THE ISSUE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS?
THE MIXED MESSAGE AND THE DEBACLE CALLED SYRIA CAN'T BE REPEATED WHEN IT COME TO IRAN.
Jon: DON'T YOU DARE TRY TO NOT BOMB IRAN. OBAMA! GOT TO GIVE LINDSEY GRAHAM CREDIT FOR THAT ONE THERE. AT LEAST HE SAID HIS POINT WITHOUT RAISING THE SOUNDS OF LIKE A 19th CENTURY SOUTHERN BELLE.
I REALLY WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN IRAN. NOW THE AYATOLLAHS IN IRAN WOULD BE DANCING AND THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE NOT DANCING IS BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN DANCING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND I SAY TO YOU, GOOD SIR, YOU CAN'T TRUST A GENTLEMAN WHO DOESN'T ENJOY TAKING TO THE FLOOR. (LAUGHTER) FOR A STATELY QUADRIL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
