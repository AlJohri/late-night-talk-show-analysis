WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, BEST SELLING AUTHOR, HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED DECEMBER 1941, 231  DAYS THAT CHANGED AMERICA AND SAVERED THE WORLD. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM CRAIG SHIRLEY. SIR. NICE TO SEE YOU, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
YOU BET, THANK YOU.
DECEMBER 1941, 31 DAYS, HERE IS WHAT I LIKE. I LOVE HISTORICAL NONFICTION. I READ IT IN THE BATH-- WHERE I AM. -- I AM. BUT TYPICALLY IT'S WRITTEN FROM SORT OF A DISTANT PERSPECTIVE. YOU WENT THROUGH NEWSPAPERS.
UH-HUH.
MAGAZINES.
AND MAGAZINES AND THINGS AND IT GIVES IT AN IMMEDIATESY THAT I THINK IS  DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THESE TYPES OF THINGS WHERE. DID THAT COME FROM?
WELL, I GREW UP IN A FAMILY, THE POINT OF REFERENCE GROWING UP AS A  CHILD WAS THE WAR, BEFORE THE WAR, DURING THE WAR, AFTER THE WAR AND I HAVE AN UNG WOHL WAS KILLED IN WORLD WAR II AND MY GRANDFATHER  WAS A CIVIL DEFENSE CAPTAIN IN WORLD WAR II AND MY PARENTS DID SCRAP DRIVES AND  BOTH MY GRANDMOTHERS WERE ROSSIE THE RIVETERS. ONE INSPECTED BOMBS, ANOTHER TESTED MACHINE GUNS. SO GROWING UP IN THIS HOUSEHOLD I HEARD ABOUT ALL THE EXPLOITS AT THEIR LEVEL  FROM THE CITIZEN LEVEL SOICHLT WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE, NOT FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT OR CHURCH HILL'S PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF  OUR PARENTS.
AND GRANDPARENTS.
THE INTERESTING THING THAT IS THE SENSE TRULY THE SENSE OF SURPRISE, YOU KNOW  THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A SURPRISE ATTACK.
RIGHT.
BUT AT GOVERNMENT LEVEL, OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WAS IN THE WIND.
RIGHT.
FDR WE FOUND, MY SON FOUND A MEMO IN THE LIBRARY, THE PRESIDENT HAD GOTTEN ON DECEMBER 4th, 1941, 26 PAGE MEMO WHICH OUTLINED IN GREAT  DETAIL JAPANESE ES MEANAGE ACTIVITIES IN AMERICA AND IN THE HAWAIIAN TERRITORY. AND ON PAGE FOUR IT SAID VERY EXPLICITLY THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY FOR JAPANESE MILITARY ACTION  AGAINST EITHER THE WEST COAST, PAN AMA CANAL OR HAWAII ISLANDS SOCKS WE KNEW IT WAS IN THE WIND. THE JAPANESE HAD BECOME MILL TARRISTIC, QUIT THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS, INVADE  MANCHURIAN, PUT TROOPS INTO INDOCHINA AND THEY EXPANDED THEIR MILITARY. SO THAT IS WHY WE WERE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM TO GET THEM OUT OF CHINA.
Jon: THE FASCINATING PART IS THAT YOU MADE YOUR SON DO ALL THAT RESEARCH. (LAUGHTER)
FOR THREE REASONS. FIRSTLY, HE IS A NAVY BRAT AND HE LOVES HISTORY AND HE CAME VERY CHEAP.
Jon: SO IT WASN'T LIKE ARE YOU BEING PUNISHED, YOUNG MAN.
YEAH, REALLY INTERESTING, I DID NOT REALIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS COUNTRY PUT THE JAPANESE CITIZENS  THROUGH THE HELL THAT THEY PUT THEM THROUGH THAT YOU COULD BE ARRESTED, NOT JUST  WEST COAST DEPUTIES, IF YOU HAD A CAMERA.
RIGHT.
YES.
YOU HAD TO TURN IN, AFTER DECEMBER 7th THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE  FRANCIS-- ORDERED ALL JAPANESE AMERICANS TO SURRENDER THEIR CAMERAS AND ANY RECORDING DEVICES THEY  TO THE LOCAL POLICE. STARTING THE AFTERNOON ON DECEMBER 7th THERE WERE JAPANESE NATIONALS IN WASHINGTON WHO WERE PICKED  UP BY THE FBI. FRANCIS BIDDLE IS REALLY AN UNSUNG HERO OF WORLD WAR II BECAUSE J. EDGAR HOOVER AND  THE ARMY WANTED TO INCARCERATE EVERY JAPANESE.
Jon: AND GERMANS AND ITALIANS.
RIGHT. AND BITTLE WENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND SAID THIS IS EXCESSIVE, MR. PRESIDENT. LET'S JUST INCARCERATE THE ONES THAT ARE ON OUR WATCH LIST.
Jon: THIS IS EXCESSIVE, LET'S JUST GET LIKE 20,000 OF THEM.
IT IS MORE ABOUT 140,000, RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: YOU KNOW, THE INCREDIBLE THING IS ALSO YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY  GO AFTER JAPAN IN THE MANNER THAT YOU MIGHT THINK.
NO.
Jon: OF THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ATTACKED US.
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW-- I DON'T WANT TO SAY SLOW BUT HOW OUR RESPONSE WAS MORE  DIRECTED TOWARDS GERMANY AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE. FDR WAS UNDER, OF COURSE, THE JAPANESE ATTACKED US ON THE 7th. WE DECLARE A WAR ON THE 8th.
Jon: ONLY TO JAPAN.
ONLY JAPAN. SO WE'RE COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON WAR WITH JAPAN IN THE PAS CIVIC. BUT THERE IS NO CALL IN THIS COUNTRY WHATSOEVER TO GO TO WAR WITH GERMANY AND ITALY. ONLY AFTER ON DECEMBER 11th WHEN THEY DECLARE A WAR ON US DO WE RELUCTANTLY SAY  OKAY, WE HAVE TO RESPOND IN KIND SO FDR ASKED THE CONGRESS FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST JAPAN, GERMANY AND ITALY. BUT WE WERE SO MILITARILY WEAK IN THE PAS CIVIC, AND THERE WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE  THAT CHURCHILL WAS PUTTING ON ROOSEVELT TO CONCENTRATE OUR RESOURCES IN EUROPE, SO  REALLY IT WAS A GREAT DEBATE IN THIS COUNTRY. WHAT GOES FIRST, THE PAS CIVIC OR ATLANTIC. IN MANY WAYS THE ATLANTIC CAME FIRST.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I LOVE, WITH THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS SO INTERESTING TO SEE THE LAYERS OF THE DEBATE.
RIGHT.
Jon: AND THE COLOR OF IT BECAUSE YOU FORGET THAT IT'S NOT AS MONOCHROME ATTIC OF  WHAT YOU IMAGINE IN RETROSPECT IN MOST HISTORY BOOKS. REALLY INTERESTING. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR SON DO NEXT. (LAUGHTER)
TAKE OUT THE TRASH.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY, REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU, IT'S CALLED DECEMBER 1941, ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. CRAIG SHIRLEY.
