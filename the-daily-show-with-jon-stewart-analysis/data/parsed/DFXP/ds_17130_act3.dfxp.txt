WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. THERE WERE A LOT PRANKS WE PULLED ON EACH OTHER. THIS ONE PRANK THEY PULLED ON ZACH-- ZACH HAS A NUT ALLERGY.
AND I'M NOT EVEN GAY. > Jon:  RIGHT, RIGHT..>
SO I HAD THE, YOU KNOW, KRAFT SERVICE GUY PUT SOME WALNUTS IN HIS BREAKFAST BURRITO. AND HIS THROAT CLOSED UP. TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE, LIKE, "SOMEONE CALLFA DOCTOR." AND THERE WAS HAGUE. IT WAS SO FUNNY. "NO, SERIOUSLY, SOMEONE CALL A DOCTOR." AND THE E.M.T.s CAME. AND THEY SAID-- THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID, "IF IT HAD BEEN FIVE MINUTES LATER, HE WOULD HAVE  DIED."   ( LAUGHTER )
UHM, I ONCE PRANKED WILL. I GOT HIS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND TAX I.D. NUMBER, AND, LIKE, GOT INTO HIS CORPORATE ACCOUNT, AND I OPENED THREE FILENE'S BASEMENTS WITH HIS MONEY.
Jon:  IS THAT THE FIRST YOU'RE HEARING OF THIS? OR IS THAT--
YEAH.   ( LAUGHTER )
PRANKS ARE KIND OF LIKE--
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE LAME QUESTIONS FOR US?   ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  WHAT-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I JUST--
NO, COME ON, HERE'S-- "WAS IT FUN ON THE SET?"  "OH, YOU GUYS SEEM LIKE YOU GET ALONG." CAN YOU ASK SOME MORE LAME-ASS QUESTIONS.
Jon:  MUST BE PRETTY NICE FOR THE TWO OF YOU TO GANG UP ON ONE GUY. PROBABLY FEEL LIKE BIG MEN.
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST PREPARE MORE NEXT TIME.
YEAH. HAT'S BEING A PROFESSIONAL..T
YEAH, THIS IS A JOB. WE WORK. WE DON'T SIT AROUND PRANKING-- Q. OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WASGOING TO BE  I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS GOING TO BE TWO ON ONE. I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE. ( BLEEP )! YOU WANT ME TO HAM YOU? YOU WANT ME TO GO HAM ON YOUR ASS?   ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
OH, GREAT, GREAT.
WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY NOW, MY BROTHER?   ( LAUGHTER ).
THIS GUY AGAIN.
Jon:  HOLD ON LET ME JUST-- CAN YOU EVEN TELL US APART? BOTH CHISELED OUT OF GRANITE, EXCEPT FOR ME.
IT'S UNCANNY.
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK AN APOLOGY IS WARRANTED.
THANK YOU, JON. WE'RE SORRY. WE DIDN'T MEAN TO--   ( LAUGHTER ).
Stephen:  OH, I GUESS NOW WHEN IT'S A FAIR FIGHT, EVERYBODY BACKS DOWN. IS THAT HOW IT GOES?
WE DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARD FEELING.
YEAH.
IT'S OKAY. WE'RE SORRY.
GOOD, GOOD. WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TO BE ON THE SHOW.
Jon:  A BUNCH OF BABY PUNCHING ( BLEEP ).   ( LAUGHTER )    ( APPLAUSE )   ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HANDLE THIS. YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM A QUESTION?
WELL, THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH YOUR QUESTION WHICH WERE ADMITTEDLY TERRIBLE.   ( LAUGHTER )  TERRIBLE QUESTIONS.
YOU DON'T THINK THAT?
I MEAN, HONESTLY, JON WE--   ( LAUGHTER )   WE REALLY-- WE REALLY HAVE TO ELEVATE THE QUALITY OF QUESTIONS. HERE'S A GOOD QUESTION-- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WOKE UP BLEEDING?
Jon:  OUT OF-- OUT OF WHERE?
ANSWER THE QUESTION.
Jon:  SHOULD I ASK THAT-- OR IS THAT SOMETHING I SHOULD ANSWER MYSELF. IS THAT SOMETHING I SHOULD PUT IN-- HAVE YOU GUYS EVER WOKEN UP BLEEDING?
ABOUT 30 DAYS AGO.
NOW WE KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT ZACH.
I-- I CAN'T RECALL A TIME THAT I WAS EVER ASKED THAT QUESTION DOING PRESS FOR A MOVIE.
Jon:  GUYS, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SHOW NOW FOR A LONG TIME, AND I JUST NEVER THOUGHT  ABOUT IT LIKE THAT AND I THANK YOU BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WASTING PEOPLE'S TIME FOR-- FOR ALMOST  15 YEARS.
I THINK IT'S--
DO YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE AUDIENCE?
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT, I-- I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU PEOPLE THAT I FIGURED BECAUSE THIS IS  BASIC CABLE THAT-- THAT I COULD BRING ON-- THAT I COULD BRING ON TWO TO THREE STARS AND NOT-- AND  BASICALLY JUST-- AND FILM A CIRCLE JERK, AND I APOLOGIZE. I APOLOGIZE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). TO YOU, AND TO THE PEOPLE AT HOME. NOT-- AND NOT JUST FOR THE INTERVIEW I DID HERE, BUT ALL THE INTERVIEWS, AND THE SHOW IN GENERAL. AND I'M SORRY. AND I--
HOW LONG HAS THIS SHOW BEEN ON THE AIR?
Jon:  I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T WATCH IT. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR--
LET THIS BE A NEW BEGINNING, OKAY?
Jon:  I THINK IT WILL. I'VE LEARNED A LOT HERE TODAY AND I-- WAS THIS PLANNED AS AN INTERVENTION OR DID IT JUST HAPPEN?   ( LAUGHTER )
WHEN YOU-- WHEN YOU BRING JOHN HAM INTO A SITUATION THINGS HAPPEN.
Jon:  I APPRECIATE IT. OH! BEFORE-- BEFORE WE GO, THOUGH, I DO WANT TO ASK YOU GUYS...   ( LAUGHTER )  WHAT--    ( LAUGHTER )  WHAT--
SHOULD WE DO THE BOB DOLE?
SURE. WE CAN DO THAT. YOU WANT TO GO THERE?
Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO IS IF WE DO THIS AND ONE OF YOU COULD SIT ON THIS. THIS IS HOW WE DO IT AT A JEWISH WEDDING WHEN WE DON'T HAVE CHAIRS. IF YOU WANT TO DO IT LIKE THAT. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS BEING HERE AND ASKING ME TO COME CORRECT. AND I APOLOGIZE. "THE CAMPAIGN," IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE THEATERS AUGUST 10. AND THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE YOU COULD TELL THEY HAD A LOT OF-- YOU'RE RIGHT. I WAS DOING IT AGAIN. I APOLOGIZE. ALSO GO TO THE WEB. THE KEEP ADS THEY RAN AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE UP THERE.
