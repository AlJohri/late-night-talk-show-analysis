JANUARY 30, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS LOU DOBBS FROM FOX BUSINESS NEWS NETWORK WILL BE JOINING US. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY. VERY UNUSUAL FOR US TO DO THIS. THERE'S A GENTLEMAN IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT. HE HAS A MESSAGE FOR HIS PARENTS THAT I THINK HE WAS AFRAID TO DELIVER TO THEM IN PERSON. HE WANTED ME TO DELIVER IT. TO SEAN'S PARENTS-- AND I'M NOT GOING TO USE HIS LAST NAME-- HE WANTS YOU, MOM AND  DAD, TO KNOW SOMETHING. HE'S... SEAN IS A CANADIAN. ( APPLAUSE ) DO NOT RIDICULE. HE'S BECOME FRIENDLY WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE FOUR OTHER CANADIANS. TOGETHER, I BELIEVE, THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO FORM A PROVINCE. I DON'T KNOW. APPARENTLY THE GUY WROTE A MASTER'S DISSERTATION ON THE DAILY SHOW. HE JUST WANTED HIS PARENTS TO KNOW HE'S NOT A LOSER. BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  SERIOUSLY HE WROTE HIS  DISSERTATION ON THE DAILY SHOW. MY GUESS IS THEY'RE NOT LETTING HIM BACK INTO CANADA. HE'S STUCK HERE. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH TOMORROW. THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL FLORIDA PRIMARY TWO WEEKS AGO THE WINNER SEEMED CLEAR.
LATEST POLL IN FLORIDA SHOWS MITT ROMNEY LEADING WITH 36% FOLLOWED BY NEWT GINGRICH  WITH 24.
Jon: ROMNEY IN A LANDSLIDE. A ROM-SLIDE. THE REPUBLICANS ARE BUILDING A BRIDGE TO HANDSOME TOWN. BUT THEN UNEXPECTEDLY, A TROLL LIVING UNDER THAT BRIDGE... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... UNLEASHED HIS PATENTED  DICK-FU IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
GOVERNOR ROMNEY, AS GOVERNOR RAISED TAX. MASSACHUSETTS WAS 47th IN JOB CREATION. ROMNEY-CARE DOES PAY FOR TAX- PAID ABORTIONS. GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S SUPER PAC, OVER WHICH HE APPARENTLY HAS NO INFLUENCE WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH INFLUENCE HE  WOULD HAVE IF HE WERE PRESIDENT.
Jon: WHENEVER NEWT GINGRICH SAYS SOMETHING NASTY LIKE THAT, I ALWAYS IMAGINE HE PUNCTUATES IT DOING THIS. MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH INFLUENCE HE WOULD HAVE AS PRESIDENT.
THERE'S A POINT IN THIS PROCESS WHERE IT GETS UNNECESSARILY PERSONAL AND NASTY. THAT'S SAD.
Jon: BUT GINGRICH'S LIZARD ATTACKS PAID DIVIDENDS. HE WON IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND BEGAN TO TURN THE TIDE IN FLORIDA.
GINGRICH GETTING A BIG BOUNCE OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA ON THAT SUNDAY AFTER SOUTH  CAROLINA LEADING ROMNEY IN FLORIDA BY SIX POINTS.
Jon: GINGRICH IN A LANDSLIDE. A GING-GLIDE. AMERICA, BRACE YOURSELF FOR A GINGRICH WHITE HOUSE AND A NEW HAIR STYLE CRAZE. NO! I MEANT HIS WIFE'S HAIR. THERE. WITH HIS NEW LEAD IN FLORIDA, GINGRICH FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO START SPECULATING ABOUT THE FUTURE.
BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM, WE WILL HAVE THE FIRST PERMANENT BASE ON THE MOON. (LAUGHING).
Jon: BY THE END OF MY THIRD TERM, I WILL HAVE SHAVED THE SIDES OFF MICHIGAN SO IT LOOKS  LIKE IT'S FLIPPING OFF ALIENS. BY MY FIFTH TERM, I WILL HAVE FED THE NATION'S POOR WITH THE CHEAP FOOD STUFF MADE FROM  THEIR OWN CHILDREN. BY MY SEVENTH TERM I WILL HAVE TRAINED CATS TO DO JOBS THAT IMMIGRANTS DO. SO HOW DID MITT MANAGE TO CLAW HIS WAY BACK? WELL, GINGRICH WON HIS ADVANTAGE BY BEING KIND OF A HUGE DICK TO ROMNEY IN THE  SOUTH CAROLINA DEBATES SO WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE FLORIDA DEBATES....
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF PEOPLE DIDN'T MAKE ACCUSATIONS SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT THEY  WEREN'T WILLING TO DEFEND HERE? HAVING DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS ON ISSUES DOES NOT JUSTIFY LABELING PEOPLE WITH HIGHLY  CHARGED EPITHETS. YOU ALSO HAVE INVESTMENT FOR MUTUAL FUNDS THAT INVESTED IN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. IF I HAD A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE COME TO ME AND SAY THEY WANTED TO SPEND A FEW HUNDRED BILLION  DOLLARS TO PUT A COLONY ON THE MOON I'D SAY, "YOU'RE FIRED."  (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MY BALLS STILL HURT. WOW! YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT ROMNEY THOUGH WHEN HE SAYS SOMETHING DICKISH, HE DOESN'T  LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF GUY LIKE THIS. HE WOULD BE THE KIND OF GUY THAT WOULD GO LIKE THIS. SO NO MORE MR. NICE MORMON. HERE'S THE MOST AMAZING PART. WATCH GINGRICH RESPOND DURING THE DEBATE TO THE CAVALCADE OF INSULTS.
IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU HAD THE SAME STANDARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE  APPLIED TO YOU AND DIDN'T ENTER PERSONAL ATTACK ABOUT PERSONAL ACTIVITIES ABOUT  WHICH ARE FACTUALLY WRONG. I WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE A TRUCE WITH YOU. BUT IT'S A TWO-WAY TRUCE.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GINGRICH? YOU'VE GOT BELLY-UP. YOU'RE SHOWING HIM HE'S VULNERABLE. WATCH ROMNEY EXPLOIT THE ADVANTAGE. BY USING NEWT GINGRICH'S VERY OWN MOVE ON GINGRICH HIMSELF.
UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHEN THE PRESSURE OF A CAMPAIGN HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE  HIGHER, THE WRONG SIDE OF NEWT GINGRICH IS BEING REVEALED. THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SAD AND PAINFUL. (LAUGHING)
Jon: TIME FOR PERHAPS ONE MORE MOVE.
FINISH HIM!
Jon: YES. FINISH HIM. IF ONLY YOU KNEW GINGRICH'S MOST VULNERABLE SPOT.
MY RECORD, MY INTEGRITY, MY HONESTY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER MY LIFE. BEEN MARRIED TO THE SAME WOMAN OVER 42 YEARS. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
