HEY, WELCOME BACK. WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF OUR NATION'S HALLOWED INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING.
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS LOOKING INTO WHETHER SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES AT JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY HAVE BEEN MISHANDLED. THE INVESTIGATION STEMS FROM A COMPLAINT FILED BY A FORMER JMU STUDENT. SHE CLAIMS THREE FRATERNITY BROTHERS PULLED OFF HER BATHING SUIT TOP DURING A SPRING BREAK TRIP TO FLORIDA LAST YEAR, RECORDED THE INCIDENT AND THEN PASSED THE TAPE AROUND TO OTHERS.
Jon: WHOA. EVEN THE CLASSIC VIRGINIA SAFETY SCHOOL IS NO LONGER SAFE. [LAUGHTER] THIS CASE, YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN TO JMU, HUH? THIS CASE IS HORRIFYING, BUT AT LEAST, AT LEAST THE WOMAN HAS EVIDENCE, YOU KNOW, VIDEO. MOST SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO PROVE. OFTEN VICTIMS DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN COME FORWARD. AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE DENIALS AND APPEALS. AT LEAST THIS TIME THE SCHOOL CANNOT SWEEP THIS UNDER THE RUG. SO, SO WHAT'S THE PUNISHMENT?
ALL THREE STUDENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT EXPELLED UPON GRADUATION.
Jon: YES! JUSTICE! WAIT A MINUTE. EXPELLED UPON GRADUATION? ISN'T THAT GRADUATION? [LAUGHTER]
THEY MAY NOT BE ON JMU'S CAMPUS FOR ANY REASON AFTER GRADUATION.
Jon: SO NO ALUMNI TAILGATING OR REUNIONS OR BRINGING YOUR KIDS BACK TO SHOW THEM WHERE YOU ABUSED GIRLS? MY GUESS IS THOSE IDIOTS WENT THROUGH WORSE PUNISHMENT AT THEIR FRATERNITY INITIATION. JAMES MADISON UNIVERSITY WILL BE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE COUNTRY.
55 COLLEGES UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR THE WAY THEY HANDLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE.
THESE ASSAULTERS ARE GETTING 30 DAYS OR A SEMESTER OFF.
EVEN IF THE SCHOOL FOUND THEIR ATTACKER GUILTY, THEY WOULD GET NOTHING HARSHER THAN WRITING A BOOK REPORT.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEPED]? ARE COLLEGES TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE SEXUAL ASSAULT? YOU KNOW WHAT THE REST OF US CALL IT WHEN WE GET 30 DAYS OFF AND GET TO READ A BOOK? VACATION. CLEARLY UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT MAKING IT SAFE FOR WOMEN. JORDAN KLEPPER AND JESSICA WILLIAMS HAVE COME UP WITH SOME CAMPUS SAFETY DO'S AND DON'TS. GUYS, TAKE IT AWAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
OKAY, BROS. PARTY COMMANDMENT NUMBER ONE: BEER BEFORE LIQUOR, NEVER BEEN SICKER.
AND LADIES, NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF YOUR DRINK EVER. DON'T BE A DOOFIE. WATCH OUT FOR A ROOFIE.
THIS IS A BIG ONE, GUYS: DON'T PASS OUT ON THE COUCH. SOMEONE MIGHT DRAW LIKE A DICK ON YOUR FACE.
YES, DO NOT PASS OUT ON THE COUCH, LADIES. SOMEONE WILL PUT THEIR DICK ON YOUR FACE AT A MINIMUM.
I MEANT... YOU KNOW WHAT, NEVER MIND. NOW, IF YOU AND YOUR BROS DO GET HAMMERED, WHICH YOU WILL -- NICE -- FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK. TAKE A CAB. YOU CAN JUST PASS OUT IN THE BACK.
OH, AND ALSO FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS STAY AT PARTY DRUNK. GIRL, GET HER OUT OF THERE. CALL A CAB FROM AN ACTUAL CAB COMPANY THAT HAS A WEB SITE, NOT SOME CREEPY GUY WITH A YELLOW CAR.
BREATH MINTS, BREATH MINTS ARE SUPES IMPORTANT.
OK, WAIT. I'M NOT DONE. DON'T GET IN A CAR WITH DOORS THAT LOCK AUTOMATICALLY. YOU WANT TO RIDE WITH ONE HAND ON THE DOOR HANDLE AND ONE ON YOUR FRIEND SO YOU CAN BREAK HER FALL IF YOU NEED TO JUMP AND ROLL.
CHAPSTICK.
SHUT UP.
OK.
SHUT UP. WHILE YOU'RE IN THE CAB, FOLLOW YOUR ROUTE ON GOOGLE MAPS. IF THE DRIVER MAKES A WEIRD LEFT TURN, DROP A PIN ON THE MAP, CALL 991 AND GET READY TO JUMP, GIRL. YOU IN DANGER.
YIKES, IF IT'S SUCH HASSLE, WHY DON'T YOU JUST WALK HOME.
REALLY? OKAY, LADIES IF YOU'RE GONNA WALK HOME, MAKE SURE YOU BROUGHT AN OVERCOAT TO HIDE THOSE GAMS. YOU CAN JUST THROW A BLANKET OVER YOUR DRUNK FRIEND. DITCH THE HEELS AND CHANGE INTO SOME SHOES THAT YOU CAN RUN IN. AND ADOPT A MASCULINE GAIT. IF YOU HAVE A HOODIE, KEEP IT UP. AND NO EARBUDS. OK? YOU MIGHT AS WELL WEAR A SIGN THAT SAYS, "I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING. TACKLE ME FROM BEHIND, PLEASE." MAKE SURE, MAKE SURE YOU GET YOUR KEYS OUT BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR APARTMENT. AND THEN TO MAKE SURE ANYONE WITHIN EARSHOT DOESN'T FIND OUT YOU LIVE ALONE, OPEN THE DOOR AND SHOUT "HONEY, I'M HOME."
[BLEEPED]. BROS BEFORE HOES. DON'T TEXT YOUR JUNK CAUSE NOWADAYS POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS WILL CHECK SOCIAL MEDIA --
OH, MY GOD, THAT REMINDS ME. OH MY GOODNESS, LADIES IF YOUR CRAZY EX-WON'T STOP TEXTING YOU, PICTURES OF HIS JUNK, SAVE ALL OF THEM, ALSO ANY ANGRY VOICE MAILS, WEEPY VOICE MAILS, THREATENING TWEETS AND TUMBLR POSTS. AND SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE OF HIM OUTSIDE OF YOUR WINDOW WATCHING YOU SLEEP. JUST SAVE IT ALL. OKAY? THE COLLEGE AND THE COPS WON'T DO ANYTHING, BUT MAYBE IT WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR CIVIL SUIT.
ALL RIGHT. OKAY. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OKAY. LET'S BE REAL. LET'S BE REAL HERE, JESSICA.
OK. PLEASE.
YOU'RE TELLING ME WOMEN JUST SPEND THEIR WHOLE DAY NAVIGATING AN OBSTACLE COURSE OF SEXUAL MENACE?
YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.
SERIOUSLY?
SERIOUSLY.
[BLEEPED]. SORRY. BUT NOT ALL MEN ARE BAD. I MEAN, SOME ARE STILL GENTLEMEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, OKAY. YEAH, THANKS. YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND NEXT TIME A GUY SAYS HE WANTS TO LICK MY BACK WHILE I'M WALKING TO WORK AT 8:00 IN THE [BLEEPED] MORNING.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER AND JESSICA WILLIAMS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
