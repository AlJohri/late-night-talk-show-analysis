FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. VERY EXCITED.
[AUDIENCE CHEERING] STEWART, STEWART, STEWART!
Jon: IT'S VERY KIND TO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU WERE DOING THERE. TONIGHT'S GUEST, HASSAN ABBAS, HERE TO TALK ABOUT HIS NEW BOOK "THE TALIBAN REVIVAL," WHICH IS REALLY ONE OF THE WORST BROADWAY REVIVALS THAT'S COME OUT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING THERE, TALIBAN? WHAT THE WHO? THEY WENT OUT OF STYLE. THAT'S TEN YEARS OLD. ISN'T THERE A HIPPER, MORE-WITH-IT MILITANT FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC TERRIBLE THREAT FOR TODAY'S GENERATION?
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS KNOWN AS ISIS.
Jon: OH. [LAUGHTER] FIRST RULE OF EVIL, TRY NOT TO HAVE YOUR ACRONYM REMIND PEOPLE OF '70s LIVE ACTION CHILDREN'S TELEVISION SHOWS. [APPLAUSE] YES, WE ARE TAKING OVER YOUR TOWN. FROM NOW ON EVERYONE REPORTS TO ME! CAPTAIN KANGAROO. DOESN'T WORK. LISTEN, OBVIOUSLY ALL WE SEEM TO KNOW ABOUT THIS GROUP RIGHT NOW IS THEY DO INCREDIBLY EVIL [BLEEPED]. THEY ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE. BUT WHO ARE THEY?
EMERGING FROM THE CHAOS NEXT DOOR IN SYRIA, THE EXTREMISTS CALL THEMSELVES ISIS FOR THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA.
Jon: PRETENTIOUS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW?
ISIS CAPTURED MILITARY DEPOTS, EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS.
THEY LEARNED HOW TO SELF-FINANCE.
THEY USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WEAPON.
Jon: I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, EVERYBODY USES SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WEAPON. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR. WHAT ELSE?
MOST-FEARED TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD.
THIS TERRORIST ARMY.
SEIZING CONTROL OF CITY AFTER CITY.
WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
THIS IS AL QAEDA TIMES TWO.
EVEN AL QAEDA SAYS ISIS IS TOO VIOLENT.
THEY'RE BLOODTHIRSTY RADICAL ISLAMIC JIHADISTS.
ISIS IS PURE EVIL.
ISIS IS LIKE A CANCER.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE UNSTOPPABLE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: SO THAT'S IT. I GUESS WE'RE DONE THEN. UNSTOPPABLE, HUH? WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY, RUSSIA, CHINA, U.S., GET THE AVENGERS TOGETHER? THAT'S IT? IT'S JUST, ARE WE GOING TO DO ANYTHING?
U.S. AIR STRIKES HAVE ALREADY HIT ISIS HARD IN IRAQ.
THE U.S. CONDUCTED TWO MORE AIR STRIKES IN IRAQ AGAINST ISIS TARGETS TUESDAY, PUTTING THE NUMBER AT 98 STRIKES THIS MONTH.
Jon: OH, AIR STRIKES. [LAUGHTER] AMERICA'S ANSWER TO REALLY ANY PROBLEM IT SEEMS. AIR STRIKES ARE LIKE FOR AMERICA CLUB SODA. OH, YOU GOT A LITTLE STAIN ON YOUR SHIRT THERE? TRY A LITTLE AIR STRIKES. YOUR STOMACH UNSETTLED? YOU KNOW, AIR STRIKES WILL FIX YOU RIGHT UP THERE. AN EVIL, UNSTOPPABLE GROUP? REMEMBER, THESE GUYS ARE UNSTOPPABLE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] UNSTOPPABLE. AIR STRIKES AREN'T REALLY GOING TO CUT IT, ARE THEY?
GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY INDICATED LAST WEEK ISIS COULD NOT BE DEFEATED OR CONTAINED SIMPLY USING AIR STRIKES IN IRAQ.
MOST OF THE MILITARY EXPERTS SAY YOU HAVE TO GO INSIDE SYRIA.
COULD YOU SEE AS CRAZY AS IT MIGHT SOUND, SOME SORT OF COVERT COOPERATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE SYRIAN REGIME OF PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD IN DAMASCUS?
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT IS [BLEEPED] LIKE THIS THAT MAKES YOU ALMOST REGRET US DESTABILIZING THE REGION IN THE FIRST PLACE. [LAUGHTER] I GUESS NOW IN SOME RESPECTS... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I GUESS NOW... I GUESS NOW WE FIND OURSELVES TRAPPED BETWEEN IRAQ AND ASSAD PLACE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. I WROTE THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER... NO? WE'RE NOT. ALL RIGHT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF AN ENDER. NO? ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] SO WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
33-YEAR-OLD DOUGLAS McARTHUR McCAIN HAD GONE TO SYRIA TO JOIN THE ISIS JIHAD.
Jon: McCAIN! [LAUGHTER] SO WAIT A MINUTE. THEY'RE RECRUITING AMERICANS?
HE GREW UP IN MINNESOTA, AND NOTHING ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE HINTS WHY HE DECIDED TO SACRIFICE HIS LIFE FOR JIHAD. McCAIN'S LIKES INCLUDED PIZZA HUT, THE CHICAGO BULLS AND THE QURAN.
Jon: SO ISIS IS AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF EVIL THAT'S BEEN USING THINGS LIKE YOUTUBE TO RECRUIT HUNGRY CHICAGO BULLS FANS TO FIGHT FOR THEM. BUT FOR WHAT PURPOSE?
A MUSLIM CALIPHATE, A SINGLE ISLAMIC STATE.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CALIPH'S OUTFIT IS MEANT TO EVOKE THE EARLY ISLAMIC EMPIRE.
Jon: SO, THEY WANT A CALIPHATE, MUCH LIKE THE EMPIRE RULED BY THE UMAYYADS'S IN THE SEVENTH AND EIGHTH CENTURIES. I HOPE YOU NOTIFIED YOUR RECRUITS THAT LIFE IN THE CALIPHATE WILL BE LESS PIZZA HUT AND MORE HUT. [LAUGHTER] BUT SETTING ASIDE THE HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY OF ISIS METHODS, WHY EXACTLY DO YOU EVEN WANT YOUR OWN COUNTRY? BECAUSE WHILE YOU SEEM QUITE ADEPT AT THE DEPRAVED KILLING PART, ARE YOU REALLY PREPARED TO DO THE LITTLE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO TO RUN A FUNCTIONING STATE.
THEY PROVIDE SOME MODICUM OF LAW AND ORDER.
FOOD KITCHENS AND FIXING POT HOLES.
THEY'RE CHARGING CUSTOMS.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN COURTS.
THEY'RE ISSUING LICENSE PLATES.
ISIS MILITANTS NOW DIRECT TRAFFIC.
Jon: OH, YOU'RE DIRECTING TRAFFIC. THAT MUST BE SO HARD IN A CITY WITH EIGHT CARS LEFT. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T BE SO PROUD OF ACCOMPLISHING A JOB WHERE YOU COULD BE REPLACED BY A COLORED LIGHT, ALL RIGHT? HERE'S A QUESTION FOR YOU, GUYS WHO WANT TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN STATE, WHO IS GOING TO PAY THAT GUY'S PENSION? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE MONEY TO MAINTAIN THOSE ROADS? OH, YOU CAPTURED SOME OIL WELLS. GREAT. NOW YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD UP A BUREAUCRACY TO PUMP THAT OIL, REFINE IT. AND WHAT IF THERE IS A SPILL? YOU THINK YOU'RE RADICAL AND DETERMINED. HAVE YOU MET ENVIRONMENTALISTS? AND THAT'S NOT TO MENTION ALL THE RESOURCES YOU GOT TO SPEND KEEPING YOUR PEOPLE HAPPY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BUILD PARKS, A ZOO, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY TO HOST THE OLYMPICS, WHICH EVEN IF YOU GET, YOU'RE GOING TO JUST SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO END UP WITH A BUNCH OF SKATING RINKS YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO USE AGAIN, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU OUTLAW SKATING BECAUSE YOU'RE [BLEEPED] CRAZY. AND REMEMBER ALL YOUR FIGHTERS IN THOSE PICK-UP TRUCKS? WELL, IN 20 YEARS, GUESS WHAT, THEY'LL BE FILLING THE WAITING ROOMS IN YOUR DYSFUNCTIONAL V.A. LET'S SEE HOW MUCH FUN YOU GONNA WHEN YOU HAVE TO TERRORIZE A NINE-MONTH BACKLOG BY HAND BECAUSE ONE COMPUTER'S DEPARTMENT DOESN'T TALK TO ANOTHER COMPUTER'S DEPARTMENT. THAT'S RIGHT, ISIS, LOOK AT US, TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT US. WE'RE LIVING YOUR DREAM. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE THE MOST POWERFUL STATE IN HISTORY. WE INFLUENCE THE WHOLE WORLD, AND ALL WE TALK ABOUT IS HOW EVERYTHING SUCKS NOW. HOW MUCH HAPPIER WE WERE IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE WERE TOOLING AROUND ON HORSES, TAKING POT SHOT AT REDCOATS. NO RESPONSIBILITIES. WE COULD SPEND ALL NIGHT JUST THROWING TEA INTO A HARBOR. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT CAME AFTER THAT? TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF [BLEEPED] PAPERWORK. THAT'S RIGHT. AND BY THE WAY... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] BY THE WAY, OF ALL THE PLACES TO BUILD A NEW GOVERNMENT, GREAT JOB PICKING THE ONE REGION WHERE THEY GO THROUGH REGIMES LIKE PRINGLES. BECAUSE PRETTY SOON YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO PISS PEOPLE OFF ENOUGH THAT THEY'LL TAKE ARMS UP AGAINST YOU. AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU HAVE YOUR OWN INSURGENCY TO DEAL WITH. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT WORKING WITH PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE. AND GUESS WHAT? IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE US. SO IF THAT SEEMS GREAT, GO FOR IT. AND IN 20 YEARS WHEN YOU COME CRYING NO US, OH, NO, MY POLARIZED GOVERNMENT CAN'T AGREE ON A LONG-TERM SOLUTION FOR OUR FISCAL POLICIES, THEN ALL WE'LL HAVE TO SAY TO YOU IS THIS: WELCOME TO THE [BLEEPED] CLUB. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
