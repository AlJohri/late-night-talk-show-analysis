["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. BIG SHOW TONIGHT! OH, THE ACTOR PAUL HAVE YOU HAD  HERE. LET ME GUESS YOU MADE ANOTHER  (bleep) MOVIE AND IT'S REALLY  (bleep) GOOD. GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A CHANCE. ANYWAY -- WAIT A MINUTE -- WHERE  IS MY PEN? [LAUGHTER] I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER APPLYING  FOR A FEDERAL GRANT FOR A PEN -- [LAUGHTER] -- WHERE IS MY PEN? IT'S OFFICIAL.
THE SEQUESTRATION HAS  ARRIVED.
$85 BILLION IN AUTOMATIC  GOVERNMENT SPENDING CUTS.
Jon: DAMMIT! [LAUGHTER] THE FIRST PENALTY OF THE  SEQUESTER, MY FEDERAL PEN  PROGRAM. FAKE THING. [ LAUGHTER ] THE SEQUESTER IS HERE. THE ARBITRARY BUDGET CUTS THAT  WERE SO ONUS CONGRESS WOULD  NEVER ALLOW THE SEQUESTER TO TAKE EFFECT. REMEMBER?
IT WAS UGLY. IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE UGLY.
ONEROUS AND UNDESIRABLE AND  IT REMAINS OUR VIEW IT'S NO WAY  TO GO.
NO WAY IT CAN HAPPEN.
AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS ARE SET UP  TO BE SO PAINFUL WE DON'T HAVE  TO GET TO THAT POINT.
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.
Jon: OF COURSE IT WILL N  .T. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WOULD  HAVE TO BE NOT TO GOAT TO THIS  BALL PUNCH IT'S LIKE DENNIS RODMAN IN NORTH KOREA. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YEAH, OR THE HOTTEST SHOW IN THE  COUNTRY BEING ABOUT DUCK CALL  MANUFACTURING. BY THE WAY, EVEN THOUGH COMING  UP WITH THE MOST BASIC OF  SPENDING CUT AND TAX REVENUE FRAMEWORKS WAS BEYOND THE SKILL  LEVEL OF THIS CONGRESS THERE WAS  ANOTHER WAY TO COMPLETELY AVOID THE ARBITRARY CUTS.
WE WILL BE AMONGST THE FIRST  ON THE FLOOR TO NULLIFY THAT  PROVISION. SCONG NOT BOUND BY THIS. IT'S SOMETHING WE PASSED. WE CAN REVERSE IT.
I THINK WE'LL BYPASS THE  TRIGGER MECHANISM. WE'LL SAY TIME OUT IT DOESN'T  APPLY.
Jon: ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS  GO -- I GET I. PASSING A BUDGET  CAN BE HARD BUT TIME OUT (bleep) IS EASY. THAT'S WHY THE FOUNDERS IN THEIR  INFINITE WISDOM GAVE CONGRESS  THREE TIMEOUTS PER LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND ONE NOT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT STILL HAPPENED. BECAUSE CONGRESS AS ALWAYS ITS  INFINITE WISDOMMING FORGOT HOW  (bleep) INCOMPETENT THEY ARE. IT WAS LIKE THEY TIED A BELT  AROUND THE NECK AND LOOPED IT  OVER THE SHOWER CURTAIN IN THE HOPES THAT THIS PRESSURE WOULD  SOMEHOW HEIGHTEN THE SENSATION  OF GETTING SOMETHING DONE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HERE IS THE THING. HERE IS THE THING THAT COULDN'T  DIDN'T REALIZE. HERE IS THE THING ABOUT  AUTOEROTIC ASPHYXIATION. EVERYBODY THINKS THEY CAN PULL  IT OFF UNTIL THEY CAN'T. NOW IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS AND THE  MAIL IS STARTING TO PILEUP  OUTSIDE CONGRESS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A VERY AWKWARD  MEMORIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. THIS IS GET TOGETHER MAIN  PLAYERS IN THIS DRAMA AS EACH OF  THEM SLIPPED UP IN THE PUBLIC REMARKS LAST WEEK.
I'M PRESENTING A FAIR DEAL. THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T TAKE IT  MEANS THAT I SHOULD SOMEHOW, YOU  KNOW, DO IT A JEDI MIND MELD WITH THESE FOLKS AND CONVINCE  THEM TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO WE  WANT TOLL STEAL FROM THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FUND MORE  GOVERNMENT?
Jon: DID YOU SEE WHAT  HAPPENED THERE? OBAMA'S MESSUP WAS HE CONFUSED  THE STAR WEEKS JEDI MIND TRICK  WITH THE STAR TREK VULCAN MIND MELD TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  THINGS. JOHN BOEHNER REFERRED TO  TAXATION AS THEFT WHICH SHOWS  THAT THE LACKS UNDERSTAND OF CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS IS HE IN  CHARGE. I WONDER WHICH GETS MORE  ATTENTION.
PRESIDENT OBAMA GETTING THE  WRATH OF SCI-FI FANS.
SAYING THERE WAS NO JEDI MIND  MELD.
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO  CONFUSE THE MIND MELD WITH STAR  WARS JEDI MIND TRICK. THIS IS JEDI SAJ RELIDGE.
DID HE MESS UP, DIDN'T HE?
Jon: SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE  SAID TAXING PEOPLE STEALING. IF THERE'S EVER A FACT YOU DON'T  NEED TO CHECK IT'S ANYTHING TO  DO WITH STAR WARS OR STAR TREK IFLT WILL BE CHECK. HERE IS A SHOT OF TWITTER'S  SERVER ONE SECOND AFTER OBAMA  SAID IT.
DO A JEDI MIND MELD. [EXPLOSION] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BUT -- THEY REALLY  HAVE TO FIX THAT FLAW IN THE  DESIGN OF DEATH STAR. THE PRESIDENT IN SPEAKER  BOEHNER'S STATEMENTS WE GET A  HIBT OF WHY THE SEQUESTER IS  HAPPENING. THE PENALTY FOR NOT FINDING A  WAY TO BALANCE REVENUE AND  SPENDING CONSISTS OF CUTS IN  SPENDING. HOW DO REPUBLICANS FEEL ABOUT  CUTS IN SPENDING. WE WANT TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF  GOVERNMENT.
REDUCE THE DEBT. SHRINK THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT.
WE NEED TO CUT SPENDING.
MORE LIMITED GOVERNMENT. PUT IT ON A STRICT ATKINS STYLE  DIET.
Jon: I WISH I WAS THERE  WHEN DEMOCRATS SAID THERE'S  GOING TO BE MASSIVE ACROSS THE BOARD SPENDING CUTS. I'M SURE THE REPUBLICANS WERE  LIKE, OKAY! [LAUGHTER] IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. BASICALLY THE SEQUESTER AMOUNTS  TO CATCHING YOUR KID SMOKING AND  FORCING HIM TO SMOKE A WHOLE CARTON OF CIGARETTES ONLY YOUR  KID IS DENIS LEARY. IN CASE YOU ARE WONDER BEING  THIS INCOMPETENCE THAT WILL  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NEEDIESTEST DOES IT HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR  CONGRESS? NOT SO MUCH.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THE VERY  PEOPLE WHO VOTED TO PUT THIS IN  PLACE WON'T SEE ANY CHANGE TO THEIR OWN $174,000 PAYCHECKS.
Jon: WHAT AN ONEROUS  PENALTY FOR. THERE ARE WORST PENALTIES FOR  (bleep) ON TOP CHEF THAN  CONGRESS. AT LEAST THERE YOU HAVE TO PACK  YOUR KNIVES AND GO. WITH LAST CHANCE KITCHEN  NOWADAYS YOU GET TO WORK BACK  IN. AND THERE'S THE ALL STAR SEASON  AND PARACHUTING CONTESTANTS IN  FOR NO GOOD REASON. YOU BROUGHT JOSI IMRERKS BACK? CJ IS COOL AT LEAST HE CAN COOL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT  AUTOEROTIC ASPHYXIATION ISN'T  RIGHT METAPHOR FOR THIS  SEQUESTER. BECAUSE CONGRESS DID RIG IT UP  AND IF THEY PULLED OFF THE  COMPROMISE IT WOULD HAVE FELT AMAZING FOR THEM BUT AS USUAL  THEY DID IT WRONG AND WE'RE  BLACKING OUT WHILE THEY ARE ALL STAR JERKING
