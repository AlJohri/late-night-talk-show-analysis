FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER. STILL HERE. I AM STILL HERE. IN FOR JON STEWART WHO IS TAKING  THE SUMMER OFF TO FOLLOW HIS  DREAM AND WORK AS A NEWS MODEL FOR THE PROGRAM AT RUTGERS. VERY SEXY. LOVELY LIGHT IN THAT ROOM. OUR GUEST TONIGHT DOCUMENTARY  FILM MAKER JOSH FOX IS HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] VERY GOOD. BUT LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO IT  WITH THIS MORNING'S HISTORIC  NEWS.
BREAKING NEWS FROM THE  SUPREME COURT. DOMA, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE  ACT, RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
PROP-THE JUSTICES RULED 5-4  THAT OPPONENTS OF SAME-SEX  MARRIAGE IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT HAVE THE GROUNDS TO SUE WHICH  CLEARS THE WAY FOR GAY MARRIAGE  IN THAT STATE.
John: YES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪ MEN AND MEN AND WOMEN AND  WOMEN ♪♪  WE DID IT! WE DID IT. WELL, TECHNICALLY THE SUPREME  COURT DID IT. BUT WE WATCHED. WE WATCHED. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE WATCHED THEM DO IT. THIS MORNING THE SUPREME COURT  STRUCK DOWN BOTH THE DEFENSE OF  MARRIAGE ACT AND CALIFORNIA'S PROP-8 AMENDMENT. A HUGELY EXCITING DAY AND NOT  JUST ON THE STEPS OF THE COURT.
THE CAPITOL DISTRICT  HISTORICALLY GAY NEIGHBORHOOD  HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS PREPARING FOR A HUGE CELEBRATION  BRINGING IN MUSIC AND DJs AND  CLOSING THE STREETS DOWN.
John: AS IT'S KNOWN IN THE  CASTRO DISTRICT, WEDNESDAY. I GUARANTEE YOU, THERE WILL BE  PEOPLE THERE TONIGHT WHO AREN'T  SURE IF THEY'RE CELEBRATING PROP-8 BEING REPEALED OR ENRIQUE  AGETTING BACK FROM HIS TRIP. TODAY'S RULING WASN'T JUST A  SYMBOLIC AFFIRMATION OF GAY  PEOPLE'S DIGNITY. IT ALSO BRINGS CONCRETE RESULTS.
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FILE  JOINT TAX, FEDERAL TAX RETURNS. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO SOCIAL  SECURITY SURVIVORS BENEFITS. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO BE INFORMED  WHEN THEIR SPOUSES ARE KILLED IN  ACTION.
John: FOR TOO LONG ONLY  STRAIGHT DUMBALS HAVE BEEN ABLE  TOEN I DO PAYING THEIR TAXES AND LEARNING THAT THEIR SPOUSE HAS  BEEN KILLED. NO MORE. YOU'RE WELCOME, GAY COUPLES. YOU ARE WELCOME. WE HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE  TONIGHT. FIRST IS A MAPT A BEE LIVE  OUTSIDE THE SUPREME COURT. SAM, THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT  WAS STRUCK DOWN IN A 5-4  DECISION. WITH JUSTICE SCALIA WRITING A  BLISTERING DEFENSE.
YES. BIG SURPRISE. SCALIA WASN'T HAPPY. HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT IT IS  INAPPROPRIATE AND ARROGANT FOR  THE COURT TO STRIKE DOWN A DECADES-OLD CONGRESSIONAL LAW.
John: DIDN'T HE JUST HELP  OVERTURN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT  OF 1965 LITERALLY YESTERDAY?
Reporter: WELL, LIKE I SAID,  THIS IS A FIRMLY HELD BELIEF OF  SCALIA THAT HE HAS HELD FOR APPROXIMATELY 36 HOURS NOW.
John: TO BE FAIR. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF  MINUTES.
Reporter: IN HIS DEFENSE,  THERE IS A SUBSTANTIVE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO  CASES. IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME LEGALESE,  JOHN. HE DID NOT LIKE THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT SO HE RULED AGAINST  IT. BUT HE DID LIKE DOMA SO HE RULED  FOR IT. IT'S WHAT LAWYERS CALL THE  PRINCIPLE OF (WHINING).
John: THANK YOU. FOR A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE WE GO  LIVE TO AL MAD GAL. AL, THIS RULING IS NOW JUST 12  YEARS OLD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I'M SORRY. WHERE ARE YOU?
WHERE AM I? WHERE ARE YOU? YOU HEARD THE SUPREME COURT,  JOHN. EVERYONE HAS TO GET GAY MARRIED.
John: THAT IS NOT WHAT THE  SUPREME COURT RULED.
YES, IT IS. HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING TO  CONSERVATIVES? TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS DEAD. EVERYONE HAS TO GET GAY MARRIED  EFFECTIVELY IMMEDIATELY OR  OBAMA'S THUGS TAKE YOU TO JAIL.
John: NONE OF THAT IS GOING  TO HAPPEN.
Reporter: JOHN, I CAN'T TAKE  THAT RISK. I HAVE A WIFE AND KIDS. SO CONFUSED. WHERE IS MY FINANCEE?
John: AL, AL. THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IS  WAITING. LET'S GO. AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? THAT SHORTS ARE WAY TOO LONG. I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE OUR ROLER  SKATES ON YET.
John: ARE YOU GUYS GETTING  MARRIED IN A 1980 STEREOTYPE?
SHUT UP. WE'RE NEW TO THIS. COME ON. LET'S GO, SUGAR TITS.
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT IN  FRONT OF PEOPLE.
HERE WE GO AGAIN WITH THE  ATTITUDE. THIS IS A [BLEEP] NIGHTMARE.
John: CONGRATULATIONS YOU  TWO. YOU SHOULD REALLY READ THE COURT  DECISION IN FULL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH, MUCH  MORE COVERAGE TOMORROW ON THESE  LANDMARK GAY MARRIAGE DECISIONS BUT ONE MORE THING WE HAVE TO  GET THROUGH TONIGHT BECAUSE I  DON'T KNOW IF YOU WATCHED OUR SHOW LAST NIGHT. IF YOU DID, BE MISTAKE. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. WHY? BECAUSE YOU MISSED SOMETHING  INCREDIBLE HAPPENING IN THE  TEXAS STATE SENATE.
IT WAS A LATE AND WILD NIGHT  AT THE TEXAS STATE HOUSE. A DAY LONG FILIBUSTER ENDING  WITH A CONTROVERSIAL VOTE ON  ABORTION RESTRICTIONS.
DEMOCRAT WENDY DAVIS TOOK THE  SENATE FLOOR AT 11:18 IN THE  MORNING. THE GOAL: FILIBUSTER FOR SOME 13  HOURS UNTIL MIDNIGHT WHEN THE  SPECIAL SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD EXPIRE.
John: IT'S JUST LIKE THE PLOT  OF FRANK CAPRA'S CLASSIC MOVIE  "MRS. SMITH WANTS AN ABORTION." WHAT EXACTLY IS AT STAKE?
AT STAKE, A BAN ON ABORTIONS  AFTER 20 WEEKS AND A REQUIREMENT  THAT ALL PROCEDURES BE DONE AT SURGICAL CENTERS. THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF  AVAILABLE ABORTION CLINICS IN  THE STATE FROM 47 TO 5.
John: HOLD ON. IS FIVE ABORTION CLINICS IN  269,000 SQUARE MILES REALLY SO  BAD? THINK ABOUT IT. TEXAS WILL STILL HAVE THREE MORE  ABORTION CLINKS THAN IT HAS SIX  FLAGS AMUSEMENT PARKS. LET'S BE FAIR. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MATH. IF SENATOR DAVIS CAN TALK 13  HOURS, TEXAS WOMEN WON'T HAVE TO  DRIVE 13 HOURS TO GET AN  ABORTION. OKAY. HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?
YOU CAN'T TRADE OFF WITH A  COLLEAGUE TO GET ANY RELIEF. YOU CANNOT SIT DOWN. YOU CANNOT EAT. YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE PODIUM OR  THE DESK. YOU CANNOT LEAVE EVEN FOR A  SECOND FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING  HAVING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. YOU HAVE TO STAY ON THE TOPIC OF  THE BILL YOU ARE FILIBUSTERING.
John: OF COURSE -- AND THIS  IS IMPORTANT -- THERE IS NO SEX  IN THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM. THIS IS THE SENATE WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT. AT LEAST THOUGH TEXAS ACTUALLY  MAKES YOU FILIBUSTER DURING A  FILIBUSTER, UNLIKE WASHINGTON WHERE THE RULE IS BASICALLY, I'M  GOING TO FILIBUSTER AND THEN  I'LL GET A PEDESTRIAN CURE AND IT STILL COUNTS. PHILADELPHIA BUSTERRERS MAKE ME  TIRED. ... FILIBUSTERS MAKE ME TIRED. OKAY. SENATOR DAVIS, COUNTDOWN CLOCK  IS SET TO 13 HOURS. TALK THE TALK.
AT TIMES SHE WAS PASSIONATE. ND WHAT IS SO DISTURBING IS  THAT WE DON'T SEEM TO CARE.
OTHER TIMES DEFIANT. I'M NOT YIELDING FOR ANY  QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT.
SENATOR DOES NOT YIELD. HE REMAINS STANDING IN HER  PINK SNEAKERS FOR NEARLY 11  HOURS STRAIGHT.
John: BRAVO. BRAVO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE KIND OF  ATHLETIC FEET THAT WILL  DEFINITELY GET YOU A PRODUCT ENDORSEMENT DEAL AT THE VERY  LEAST. FILIBUSTERS. FOR WHEN YOU JUST HAVE TO STAND  THERE. STAND THERE. AND DO NOTHING ELSE. THE OPPONENTS WERE EQUALLY  DETERMINED TO ABORT HER  FILIBUSTER BEFORE IT REACHED ITS FULL 13-HOUR TERM.
STRIKE ONE WAS DAVIS' MENTION  OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHICH  REPUBLICANS SAID WAS OFF TOPIC. STRIKE 2 CAME WHEN A COLLEAGUE  OFFERED DAVIS A BACK BRACE. AND THE FINAL STRIKE CAME WHEN  DAVIS MENTIONED THE STATE'S 2011  SONOGRAM LAW. AGAIN OFF TOPIC.
John: WHAT? THIS IS A DEBATE ABOUT ABORTION  RESTRICTIONS. HOW ARE PLANNED PRNTHOOD AND  FORCED SONOGRAMS OFF TOPIC? THAT'S LIKE SAYING TALK TO ME  ABOUT WHITE CASTLE BUT DON'T  MENTION DIARRHEA. THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. ULTIMATELY THAT JOKE LANDED HARD  WITH PEOPLE HERE. ULTIMATELY DAVIS AND HER ALLIES  PUSHED THE DEBATE PAST THE  MIDNIGHT DEADLINE AND THE ABORTION BILL DIED. BUT THEN REPUBLICANS TRIED ONE  OF THE SHADIEST MOVES OF ALL  TIME.
FOR A WHILE THIS MORNING, IT  APPEARED AS THE STATE SENATORS  HAD INDEED VOTED TO PASS THE  BILL. BUT JUST A FEW HOURS ALLEGE THE  LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF TEXAS  ACKNOWLEDGED COMPUTER RECORDS HAD BEEN CHANGED TO MAKE IT LOOK  LIKE REPUBLICANS VOTED THE BILL  THROUGH IN TIME WHEN, IN FACT, THEY HAD NOT.
John: LOOK, LOOK, TEXAS. YOU TRIEDED EVERYTHING YOU  COULD. NOT EVEN AN ILLEGAL POST  MORTGAGE EM VOTE COULD REVIVE  THIS DEAD BILL. BUT LOOK, LET'S NOT CONDEMN THE  TEXAS SENATE MAJORITY. THEY'RE JUST BEING CONSISTENT. THEY SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT IF LATE  ONE NIGHT WHEN YOU'RE SWEPT AWAY  BY YOUR EMOTIONS YOU MAKE A STUPID MISTAKE, YOU SHOULD  ALWAYS HAVE A CHANCE TO FIX IT  LATER AND NOT HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.
