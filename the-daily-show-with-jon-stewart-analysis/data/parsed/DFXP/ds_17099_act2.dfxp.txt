Jon: HEY WELCOME BACK. DID YOU KNOW THAT MISSOURI GUN OWNERS FACE RAMPANT DISCRIMINATION EVERY SINGLE DAY? NO? BECAUSE THEY DON'T. BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED ONE MISSOURI LAW MAKE FRERE FIGHT ON THEIR BEHALF, ASIF  MAN VEY HAS MORE.
Reporter: THE HISTORY OF CIVIL RIGHTS IS ONE OF LONG STRUGGLE AND LONG FOUGHT  VICTORIESMENT MEET WANDA BROWN OF THE MISSOURI HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SHE'S LEADING A NEW MARCH OF PROGRESS WITH HER LANDMARK BILL HB-1621.
THIS BILL CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT THAT AN EMPLOYER CAN'T FIRE AN EMPLOYEE IF  THEY OWN FIREARMS, IF THEY USE FIREARMS. IF YOU TARGET-- IF YOU TARGET PRACTICE, IF YOU HUNT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE YOU FOR THAT REASON.
RIGHT, BUT AREN'T GUN OWNERS ALREADY PROTECTED?
WE HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION THAT SHOULD BE ABIDED BY AT ALL TIMES.
WANDA'S BILL LIKE A SECOND CONDOM ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF PROTECTION AGAINST  EMPLOYERS WHO WOULD DISREGARD THE CONSTITUTION.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT SEES DISCRIMINATION SOMEWHERE, AND WANTS TO FIGHT IT.
YES.
THANKS TO WANDA BROWN'S CRUSADE AGAINST INJUSTICE, HB-1621 SALED THROUGH THE HOUSE BY 115-36, RELEASING GUN OWNERS FROM THE SHACKLES OF PERSECUTION.
NOW A GUN OWNER CAN OWN A GUN, AND NO LONGER BE FIRED FOR IT.
TRUE. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYBODY HAVING THAT PROBLEM.
SINCE WHEN COULD YOU BE FIRED FOR HAVING A GUN.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE LAW, THE NEW LAW, THE NEW BILL.
I NEVER HEARD OF THAT.
HAVE YOU PERSONALLY EVER BEEN FIRED FOR OWNING A GUN.
NO, NO I HAVE NOT.
OH.
MAYBE WE DIDN'T TALK TO ENOUGH PEOPLE. SURELY WANDA KNOWS OF COUNTLESS OPPRESSED MISSOURI GUN OWNERS. HOW MANY EXAMPLES OF GUN OWNER DISCRIMINATION DOW CURRENTLY KNOW OF?
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WOULD RATHER NOT GET INTO EXAMPLES.
YEAH, BUT YOU MUST HAVE THOUSANDS OF THEM, YOU CAN GIVE ME A FEW?
THIS IS PREVENTIVE, TO PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT OF EVERYONE IN THE FUTURE.
WELL, WHAT-- OKAY. SO THIS IS A PREVENTIVE BILL.
YES.
GOOD PLAN, YOU SKIP ALL THE OPPRESSION AND DISCRIMINATION AND JUST JUMP  TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS.
YES.
SADLY OTHERS STILL AWAIT THEIR WANDA BROWN. I TALKED TO MIKE COLOGNEA THE ONLY GAY MAN IN THE MISSOURI HOUSE.
I CAN BE FIRED BASED UPON MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION, IS THAT RIGHT, NO IT'S NOT RIGHT. SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS NOT PROTECTED IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
NO. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ADD SEXUAL ORIENTATION TO THE MISSOURI HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS FOR YEARS.
YOU NEEDED AN ALLY, AND I KNOW JUST THE PERSON. SHE'S ALL ABOUT PROTECTION. SHE'S ALL ABOUT PRIV SEE, HER NAME IS WANDA BROWN. I WILL TALK TO HER. HOLD ON A SECRETARY.
WITH WANDA'S HELP, WE SHALL OVERCOME.
WOULD YOU SUPPORT SOMETHING BEYOND THE SECOND AMENDMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I WOULDN'T-- I HAVE NO IDEA --
OH.
BUT YOU ARE A VERY CORE PERSON WHO DISAGREES WITH DISCRIMINATION.
WELL, ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW I AM ALL FOR ANY LEGISLATOR THAT WANTS TO FILE THE BILL.
GREAT, I'M TALKING TO WANDO, LOOKING GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME WANDA BROWN.
WANDA BROWN, SHE'S GERMAN MARK -- GOT THE HAIR.
IS THIS A STATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO VOTED AGAINST PROTECTING LGBC INDIVIDUALS IN OUR  EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW.
WAIT, WHAT? WANDA HAVE YOU EVER VOTED AGAINST GAY WORKPLACE RIGHTS.
HAS THAT BEEN ON THE BALLOT HERE.
I DON'T KNOW, I'M ASKING YOU.
IT'S AN INSULT AND A SLAM UP SIDE THE HEAD. IT GOT VOTED DOWN AND WANDA WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED AGAINST IT.
THAT I KNOW OF, IT HAS NEVER IT HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I HAVE HAD TO  VOTE ON ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
ACTUALLY, ONLY A YEAR AGO SHE DID VOTE ON IT, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SHE VOTED NO. MAYBE SHE'S BEEN SO BUSY BATTLING OPPRESSION THAT DOESN'T EXIST YET, SHE  DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO FIGHT OPPRESSION THAT DOES. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SOMEONE BEING FIRED FOR THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
I-- HAS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE?
YES.
GIVE YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE.
AN EXAMPLE, DIDN'T SHE JUST --
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WOULD RATHER NOT GET INTO EXAMPLES.
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
AL FISHER, GAY SCHOOLTEACHER WAS FIRED FEBRUARY, SETH WILLIAMS, A TRANSGENDER EMPLOYEE WAS  FIRED DUE TO TRANSGENDER.
STATE TROOPER CORPORAL DENNIS ENGELHARD, HIS MALE PARTNER WAS DENIED DEATH  BENEFITS, ON MARCH 15th HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL WAS ET GO AFTER HAVING GAY RELATIONSHIP IN THE PAST.
SOMEONE ASSUMED THEY WERE FIRED FOR BEING GAY. MAYBE THEY WERE FIRED BECAUSE THEY WERE A BAD WORKER. HAVE THEY WENT TO COURT.
HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE CLAIMS THAT GO TO COURT BASED ON SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ILLEGAL.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M GETTING ZERO PERCENT.
0% OF WHAT.
0% OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL WIN A CASE IF IT IS NOT ILLEGAL.
OKAY, SAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO BACK THAT UP.
YES, COMMON SENSE.
OH WELL, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LOSE A BATTLE TO WIN THE WAR. THE IMPORTANT THING IS WANDA BROWN'S HB 1521 WILL STAND AS A MONUMENT DEFENDING THE  MOST DEFENSELESS. GUN OWNERS.
1621 SAYS YEAH.
