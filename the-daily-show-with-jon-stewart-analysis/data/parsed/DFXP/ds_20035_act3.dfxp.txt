Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR, HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WITHOUT YOU, THERE IS NO US: MY TIME WITH THE SONS OF NORTH KOREA'S ELITE" PLEASE WELCOME SUKI KIM. HELLO! THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. YOU HAVE WRITTEN A MEMOIR ABOUT YOUR TIME "WITHOUT YOU THERE IS NO US," TEACHING IN A NORTH KOREAN PRIVATE SCHOOL.
YES.
Jon:  HUH? ( LAUGHTER ) HOW DID YOU GET THAT-- IS THAT A CRAIGSLIST SITUATION? HOW -- HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE JOB AND-- HOW DID YOU END UP THERE?
WELL, I WENT UNDER COVER BECAUSE I'M NOT A TEACHER. ( LAUGHTER ) SO, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A LONG-- I PURSUED A TOPIC SINCE 2002, WHEN I FIRST WENT INTO NORTH KOREA, AND THEN I FOUND OUT THERE IS THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL THAT IS BUILT, AND I APPLIED FOR A JOB AND THAT WAS IT.
Jon:  WHAT STRUCK ME IN READING IT IS I THINK I HAVE IN MY HEAD A VERSION OF A MECHANIZED, SOULLESS PLACE OF GRAY. THE JOY, THE UPS AND DOWNS, THEY ARE KIDS. THEY'RE 19-YEAR-OLD KIDS.
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY, THE BOOK -- I ALWAYS WANT TO HUMANIZE NORTH KOREA BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY GET ANY REAL PICTURE.
Jon: RIGHT.
WE ONLY GET THE STORIES OF DEFECTORS, ONCE THEY'VE FLED NORTH KOREA, OR WE WOULD GET THE WHOLE KIM JONG IL JOKES, AND KIM JONG UN JOKES NOW.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEN NUCLEAR THREATS. THESE ARE THE ONLY THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA. AND NOW I GUESS DENNIS RODMAN.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT, I MEAN, WHO ARE --
Jon: IS HE THE ONLY THING THEY KNOW ABOUT US?
I THINK POSSIBLY, YES.
Jon:  SO WE'RE REALLY MISSING EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW? ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH, IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD MEETING.
Jon: BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS -- WHAT WAS FASCINATING TO ME IS, SO THIS IS THE ELITE OF THE ELITE AS FAR AS YOUNG PEOPLE. THESE ARE COMPUTER WIZARDS. THESE ARE ENGINEERS. THESE ARE PEOPLE STUDYING-- BUT THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNET.
IT WAS PYONGYANG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
Jon: RIGHT.
A LOT OF THEIR MAJORS -- SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE M.I.T. OF NORTH KOREA, AND THEIR MAJORS WERE COMPUTERS, A LOT OF THEM. IN 2011, WHEN I WAS THERE, THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE EXISTENCE OF THE INTERNET.
Jon:  SO WHAT ARE THEY STUDYING? ( LAUGHTER ) IF IT'S COMPUTERS, IS IT, LIKE, "AND LOOK, YOU HAVE A CALCULATOR ON IT, YOU CAN DO LIKE--" WHAT DOES A COMPUTER DO? WHAT CAN THEY TEACH THEM WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT?
I MEAN, THAT YEAR WHEN I WAS THERE, THEY WEREN'T TEACHING COMPUTER AT ALL.
Jon:  OH, THEY WEREN'T.
THEY WERE ONLY TEACHING THEM ENGLISH. BECAUSE 2011 WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL YEAR, IT WAS THE YEAR JUCHE 100. NORTH KOREA DOESN'T FOLLOW OUR CALENDAR SYSTEM. THEY FOLLOW IT FROM THE BIRTH OF THEIR ORIGINAL GREAT LEADER. SO, JUCHE, HE'S FOUNDING PHILOSOPHY, MEANING SELF RELIANCE.
Jon: OKAY.
TO CELEBRATE JUCHE 100, TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY, ALTHOUGH HE DIED IN 1994, THEY PUT ALL -- THEY CLOSED DOWN ALL THE UNIVERSITIES AND PUT ALL THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN CONSTRUCTION FIELDS.
Jon:  TO CELEBRATE.
TO CELEBRATE. TO BUILD A NATION. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS DURING CHRISTMAS BREAK. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE!
Jon:  WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM NOW? YOU KNOW, IS IT JUST-- YOU KNOW, IT IS SO ALL-ENCOMPASSING. DO THEY JUST GO THROUGH THE PRODUCTION LINE INTO A MILITARIZED ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S IT?
I THINK THAT I JUST WANT THEM TO, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE THE FUTURE LEADERS OF NORTH KOREA. THEY WERE,  WHEN ALL THE UNIVERSITIES WERE SHUT, THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO WERE ALLOWED TO BE HIDING IN THIS PRIVATE UNIVERSITY PLAYING BASKETBALL-- I PLAYED BASKETBALL WITH THEM. THEY LOVE BASKETBALL. AND I ATE THREE MEALS A DAY WITH THEM. AND SO THEY WERE CREME DA LA CREME OF NORTH KOREA. AND THEY WERE JUST SO LOVELY, BECAUSE I THINK THEY WERE ALSO SO SHELTERED FROM THE WORLD, BUT THEIR SYSTEM WAS NOT LOVELY. THEIR SYSTEM WAS MOST INHUMAN SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. SO THEY WERE PERPETUALLY SCARED. THEY WERE ALWAYS WATCHING EACH OTHER, REPORTING ON EACH OTHER.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THIS WAS A VERY, IT'S A SYSTEM BUILT ON FEAR. IT WAS -- THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE MINUTE ALONE. AND ALL THEIR LIVES WERE ABOUT THE GREAT LEADER. THEY TOOK GREAT LEADER CLASSES EVERY DAY. THEY DID GREAT LEADER DUTIES. SO I THINK THEY ARE BASICALLY REARED TO BE THE FUTURE LEADERS, AND I THINK THAT WAS MY DILEMMA BEING THERE, BECAUSE I WANTED SO MUCH TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE WORLD BUT IF I DID, THEN IT COULD BE DANGEROUS FOR THEM.
Jon:  AND FOR YOU.
FOR ME AT THE TIME, YEAH, BECAUSE I WAS UNDER COVER. I WAS --
RIGHT.
I MEAN I GUESS IF I GOT CAUGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SPY.
Jon:  RIGHT, RIGHT.
WHICH I GUESS I WAS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon: RIGHT. WELL THAT, WELL, THAT WAS A TWIST. ( LAUGHTER ) I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. ( LAUGHTER ) THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. IT'S A PHENOMENAL-- IT'S A BOOK LIKE NO OTHER BOOK I THINK I'VE EVER READ. LIKE IT'S A LOOK INTO A SOCIETY, INTO A CULTURE, BUT OBJECTIVELY AND HUMANIZING AND TERRIFYING AND REALLY AMAZING BOOK. "WITHOUT YOU, THERE IS NO US." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. SUKI KIM, THANK YOU. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
