FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER. I AM STILL SITTING IN HERE FOR  JON STEWART. WE ARE ALL MISSING JON TERRIBLY  HERE WHICH IS WHY WE WERE SO  GLAD THIS WEEKEND TO SEE HIM TWEET A PICTURE OF HIMSELF. OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH! AND IF YOU DON'T GET THE  REFERENCE FOR THAT PHOTOGRAPH,  THEN CONGRATULATIONS. YOU LIVE IN A FAR HAPPIER WORLD  THAN THE REST OF US. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW  MOVIE BLUE JASMINE WILL BE HERE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A LOT TO  TALK ABOUT. WHO AM I KIDDING. THERE WAS EXACTLY ONE THING TO  TALK ABOUT.
HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE  DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE WAS SAFELY  DELIVERED OF A SON AT 4:24 P.M. LOCAL TIME.
John: OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,  OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD, OH, MY  GOD, YES, YES, YES! A SON, A SON, YOU MEAN A KING. ALL NEAL TO THE ONE TRUE KING. NEAL FOR GOD'S SAKE. (TRUMPET FANFARE). THIS BLESSED NEWS. IT CAME AFTER A LONG DAY OF  AWAITING WORD FROM ST. MARY'S  HOSPITAL AS THE ROYAL LAD SEEMINGLY PROLONGING LABOR,  PERHAPS SENSING THAT THIS WAS  THE ONLY KIND OF LABOR THAT HE WOULD EVER BE INVOLVED IN. WE WILL HAVE FULL TEAM COVERAGE  ON THIS TOMORROW NIGHT. BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A  LITTLE TASTE OF WHAT CURRENTLY  IS OUT THERE.
THIS IS HOW BRILLIANT A ROYAL  KATE IS. THERE ARE WOMEN THROUGHOUT  BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY HISTORY  THAT HAVE PANICKED OVER NOT BEING ABLE TO DELIVER A BOY. HERE WE ARE. KATE DID IT FIRST TIME.
John: WHAT? WHAT? YOU ARE AWARE THAT SHE IS  MARRIED TO PRINCE WILLIAM AND  NOT CARL DROGO, AREN'T YOU? WHAT WOULD YOUR RESPONSE HAVE  BEEN IF IT HAD BEEN A GIRL? DAM NATION UPON YOUR CURSED  WOMAN. SHE PRODUCED A BABY OF THE  WEAKER SEX. ALL THAT TOMORROW. ALL THAT TOMORROW. BUT FIRST, FROM NEWS OF BIRTH  OVERSEAS TO NEWS OF DEATH BACK  HERE IN THE U.S.
IT HAS BEEN LONG FEARED. THIS MORNING IT IS REALITY IN  DETROIT. THE MOTOR CITY FILED FOR CHAPTER  9 PROTECTION YESTERDAY.
MO TOWN IS SINGING THE BLUES. TOWN TONIGHT IS NO TOWN. AMERICA'S MOTOR CITY RUNS OUT  OF GAS.
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, DOES  THAT TONE SEEM APPROPRIATE TO  ANYONE? A MAJOR AMERICAN CITY HAS  DECLARED BANKRUPTCY WITH  DEVASTATING HUMAN COSTS. MAYBE PUMP THE BRAKES ON THE CAR  A LITTLE BIT. IF CHICAGO WENT BANKRUPT, WOULD  YOU SAY THE WINDY CITY JUST LEFT  OUT ITS FINAL FART? NO, YOU WOULDN'T. IF HOUSTON HAD A DEVASTATING  EARTHQUAKE WOULD YOU START BY  SAYING, "HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM."  THE PROBLEM IS YOUR BUILDINGS  ARE COLLAPSING AND THERE ARE  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TRAPPED UNDER THE RUBBLE. NO, THIS IS NO PLACE FOR JOKES  AND PUNS APART FROM THIS ONE. THAT'S TOP NOTCH. THIS IS OUR JOB. JUST THE ONE BRIGHT SIDE IS THAT  DETROIT MIGHT GET A LITTLE  ECONOMIC BOOST FROM ALL THOSE REPORTERS FLOCKING TO IT TO  COVER THE STORY, RIGHT?
MIKE TOBIN LIVE IN CHICAGO  WITH THE NEWS. MIKE, A DRAMATIC AFTERNOON IN  DETROIT.
WHETHER THAT'S CHAP TERM 9  HOW THEY GO TO THE MOTIONS I  DON'T KNOW BUT JEFF LOCK DOES. HE'S RIGHT NEAR DETROIT IN  CHICAGO.
John: REALLY? CHICAGO. SO YOU HAVE REPORTERS TAKE GUN  FIRE IN WAR ZONES ALL OVER THE  WORLD. YOU'VE HAD THEM GEAR GASSED  DURING PROTESTS. YOU'VE FORCED THEM TO TAKE 200  MILES AN HOUR WINDS TO THE FACE  DURING STORMS BUT APPARENTLY HAVING THEM STAND ON A CORNER IN  DOWNTOWN DETROIT, OH, THAT IS  JUST TOO DANGEROUS AN  ASSIGNMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TELL THAT EXACTLY... EXACTLY HOW  ARE THINGS IN DETROIT?
THE DETROIT HAS LOST MORE  THAN 237,000 RESIDENTS IN THE  PAST DECADE.
78,000 CITY STRUCTURES HAVE  BEEN AABANDONNED.
50% OF THE PARKS CLOSED IN  2008. 40% OF THE STREET LIGHTS DON'T  WORK.
THIS IS A CITY THAT IS CLOSED  100 SCHOOLS SINCE 2004.
FOLKS IN DETROIT WAIT AN  AVERAGE OF 58 MINUTES FOR POLICE  TO RESPOND. THAT'S COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL  AVERAGE OF 11 MINUTES.
John: IT TAKES 58 MINUTES FOR  THE POLICE TO COME. SO WAIT. HOLD ON. IF YOU GET SHOT IN DETROIT, YOU  CAN GET A PIZZA FASTER THAN YOU  CAN GET A COP. IN FACT MAYBE THAT'S THE ONLY  WAY TO SURVIVE THERE. HEY, DOMINOES I WOULD LIKE ONE  LARGE PIZZA WITH TWO POLICEMEN  AND A SIDE OF PARAMEDICS,  PLEASE. AND CAN YOU STUFF THE CRUST WITH  GAUZE BECAUSE I'M BLEEDING  TERRIBLY. THANK YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW LOOK. DETROIT HAS NOT BEEN IN A GOOD  WAY FOR DECADES. BUT THIS BANKRUPTCY STILL CAME  AT A SURPRISE ESPECIALLY SINCE  THE CITY RECENTLY HIRED KEVYN ORR AS EMERGENCY MANAGER TO  AVOID THIS SITUATION.
WHEN HE CAME INTO THE CITY  BACK IN LATE MARCH THE GOAL WAS  TO TRY TO FIX THE CITY WITHOUT GOING THROUGH BANKRUPTCY. BUT THE MERE FACT THAT HIS  BACKGROUND IS ONE. TOP BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS IN THE  COUNTRY, IT WAS OBVIOUS IF WE  COULDN'T FIX THE CITY THROUGH NEGOTIATION, BANKRUPTCY WOULD BE  THE NEXT ROUTE TO GO.
John: THAT DOES SEEM A LITTLE  SUSPECT. I MEAN BANKRUPTCY LAWYER THAT  YOU HIRED SUGGESTED DECLARING  BANKRUPTCY. IT'S LIKE PICKING A DEMOLITION  EXPERT TO RESHINGLE YOUR ROOF. I TOOK A LOOK UP THERE AND I  THINK DYNAMITE IS IS DEFINITELY  THE WAY TO GO. THIS IS SUCH A SAD FALL FROM  GRACE. FOR ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT  CITIES. IT USED TO BE AN ECONOMIC  POWERHOUSE. PEOPLE SANG SONGS ABOUT IT. ♪ DETROIT, DETROIT ♪♪  ♪ IT'S A LAND WHERE GOLD IS MADE  OF DREAMS ♪♪  ♪ IT'S DETROIT ♪♪ ♪ DETROIT ♪♪
John: BACK BEFORE CARS HAD  RADIOS PEOPLE HAD TO HIRE MEN TO  SIT ON THEIR CARS AND SING AT  THEM. THERE WERE A LOT MORE ACCIDENTS  BACK THEN. HOW DID DETROIT GET INTO THIS  MESS? MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHO IS  RESPONSIBLE?
SNYDER'S EMERGENCY CITY  MANAGER IS TO BLAME.
CORRUPTION RUN RAMPANT UNDER  THE MAYOR.
LEFTIST DEMOCRATS. THE DOWNFALL OF THE AUTO  INDUSTRY. VERY POOR TAX COLLECTION.
GLOBALIZATION AND  TECHNOLOGICALLED ADVANCES, LOSS  OF JOBS.
John: SO IT APPEARS THAT  WE'VE NARROWED DOWN THE BLAME TO  EVERYBODY. YOU KILLED DETROIT. YOU KILLED DETROIT. YOU KILLED DETROIT. EVERYBODY KILLED DETROIT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW NOBODY GETS A CAR. WELL, ACTUALLY YOU DO BUT IT'S A  MORE AFFORDABLE CAR IMPORTED  FROM COUNTRIES LIKE. ♪ JAPAN ♪♪  AND. ♪ KOREA ♪♪  WHERE THE CARS ARE CHEAPER  BECAUSE THE PRICES AREN'T PUSHED  UP BY THINGS LIKE. ♪ HIGHER LABOR COSTS ♪♪  LOOK, THESE MUSICALS ARE CATCHY. THAT'S A FACT. I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT IT. FOLKS, IF EVERYONE CREATED THIS  MESS, WHO ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO  PAY THE PRICE FOR IT? WILL IT BE, A, VULNERABLE  WORKING CLASS RETIREES. OR WILL IT BE, B, IT'S A.
WORKERS ARE BRACING FOR WHAT  COULD HAPPEN TO THEIR PENSIONS  AND HEALTH CARE.
THE REAL VICTIMS ARE GOING TO  BE PEOPLE WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY  GOING TO SEE THEIR CONTRACTS WITH DETROIT BROKEN. PENSIONERS, PUBLIC SECTOR  WORKERS. FOLKS IN UNIONS.
I GET IT. SO DETROIT'S AUTO INDUSTRY WAS  TOO BIG TO FAIL BUT DETROIT'S  PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS ARE JUST SMALL ENOUGH NOT TO GIVE A [BLEEP] ABOUT IT. HERE IS HOW CRAZY THIS STORY IS  IS. WE ALL DETROIT TO EMERGE FROM  BANKRUPTCY OKAY, BUT WE MIGHT  NOT WANT IT TO EMERGE TOO OKAY. AND HERE IS WHY.
THEY ARE REALLY IN DIRE  STRAITS. THEY CANNOT PAY THEIR BILLS. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER  CITIES AND UP TOES AND  COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE UNFUNDED PENSIONS  AND LIABILITIES AND HEALTH CARE  COSTS. AND THEY ARE WATCHING VERY  CLOSELY TO SEE HOW THIS IS  TREATED IN COURT SO IT'S REALLY A TEST CASE. YES, WE COULD SEE MORE OF THIS.
John: OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT. SO IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, DETROIT  WILL DIE AND IF IT DOES WORK,  OTHER CITIES MAY TRY GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY TO SCREW OVER THEIR  RETIREES. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU. GLOAT BALTIMORE AND LOS  ANGELES ♪♪  DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR LIKING THAT  SONG. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND HOW  BANKRUPTCY WORKS. EVEN IF DETROIT DOES COME BACK,  IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE  ITS CREDITORS GO FULL HARD-CORE PORN ON THE PLACE.
YOU TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY  HAVING TO SELL CITY ASSETS  INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN DETROIT, INCLUDING A  PARK, INCLUDING THE VERY  VALUABLE TREASURES AT THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF ART. IS THAT ALL THAT ON THE TABLE.
I SAID AT THE BEGINNING  EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.
John: EVERYTHING'S ON THE  TABLE. EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE. YOU WANT A HOCKEY TEAM, THE RED  WINGS ARE YOURS. ARE YOU HUNGRY? CONSIDER THE DETROIT ZOO. YOUR PERSONAL MEAT LOCKER. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A HAND JOB? BECAUSE FOR $10 WE'LL GIVE YOU  THE GREATEST HAND JOB OF YOUR  LIFE. THAT'S A HUGE HAND JOB. THAT IS INSULT TO SIGNIFICANT  ECONOMIC INJURY. NOW ONE PARTICULAR DETROIT  TREASURE MAY GET THE MOST  ATTENTION.
HOWDY DOODY COULD BE THE  MOTOR CITY'S SAVIOR. THE ORIGINAL MARIONETTE USED IN  THE 1950'S TV SHOW IS PART OF AN  ART COLLECTION THAT'S ESTIMATED TO BE WORTH A BILLION DOLLARS OR  EVEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
John: NOT HOWDY DOODY. ALTHOUGH PERHAPS WE SHOULD HAVE  ALL SEEN THIS COMING. THERE WAS THAT ONE EPISODE YEARS  AGO THAT DOES NOW SEEM ODDLY  PRESCIENT.
HI, KIDS. ENJOY THE CITY WHILE YOU CAN  BECAUSE IN 50 YEARS, THANKS TO  POOR URBAN PLANNING, CORRUPT MANAGEMENT AND THE NATURAL  FORCES OF CAPITALISM, THIS CITY  WILL BE REDUCED TO A BANKRUPT  CITY.
John: INTERESTING SIDE NOTE  THERE. THOSE CHILDREN ARE NOW 75, AND  THE CITY IS WAVING HOWDY DOODY  TO THEIR PENSION. WE'LL BE RIGHT
