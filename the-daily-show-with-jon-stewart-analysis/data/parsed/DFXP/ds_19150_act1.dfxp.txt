FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHOA, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: MY NAME IS JON STEWART AND WE HAVE A GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS BAN KI-MOON IS GOING TO BE JOINING US HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S GOING TO BE HERE. (LAUGHTER) I'M EXCITED, I'M EXCITED, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT FIRST, YOU MAY REMEMBER EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE BALTIMORE RAVENS RAY RICE FOUND HIMSELF IN A BIT OF HOT WATER WHEN AN ATLANTIC CITY CASINO SECURITY CAMERA CAUGHT HIM DRAGGING HIS FIANCEE'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY OUT OF AN ELEVATOR AFTER HE HAD ASSAULTED HER BECAUSE A GENTLEMAN WOULD NEVER LEAVE HIS FIANCEE'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY UNATTENDED IN AN ELEVATOR, I MEAN -- IT WAS THE SORT OF DISPECTABLE ACT OUR SOCIETY WOULD NOT TOLERATE. AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO THROW THE BOOK AT RICE. SPECIFICALLY A BOOK TITLED SO YOU'RE SENTENCED TO COUNSELLING, A VIOLENT OFFENDER'S GUIDE TO LENIENT PUNISHMENT. BUT NOT TO WORRY, THE NFL JUMPED IN TO FILL THE JUSTICE VOID.
NFL COMMISSIONER ROGER GOODELL SLAPPED RAY RICE WITH A TWO GAME SUSPENSION.
Jon: TWO! NOT ONE. (LAUGHTER) BUT TWO! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) TWO! A TWO-GAME SLAP. TWO GAME SLAP, ONE FOR EACH WRIST. DON'T. NO. THEN AFTER A RATHER VOCIFEROUS AND NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO THE PERCEIVED CODDLING OF THE ALL-PRO ELEVATOR PUNCHER, THE NFL RECOGNIZED THE ERRORS OF ITS WAYS.
THE NFL ANNOUNCING PLAYERS WILL GET A SIX GAME SUSPENSION FOR THEIR FIRST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  OFFENSE.
Jon: AH! LET THAT BE A LESSON. TO NFL PLAYERS EVERYWHERE. IF YOU HIT A WOMAN, THEY WILL NOT LET YOU HIT A MAN FOR SIX MORE WEEKS. (LAUGHTER) THE POINT IS--  (APPLAUSE) I WOULD SAY AT THAT POINT CASE CLOSED. UNTIL THIS WEEK.
IT'S THE SECOND SHOCKING VIDEO TO SURFACE. TMZ RELEASING THIS TAPE OF BALTIMORE RAVENS PLAYER RAY RICE BRUTALLY KNOCKING OUT HIS THEN FIANCEE JANAY PALMER.
THE NFL AMMENDED HIS TWO-GAME SENTENCE AND KICKED HIM OUT OF THE LEAGUE INDEFINITELY.
NIKE CUT TIES WITH RAY RICE, SCRUBBED ALL RICE ITEMS FROM THEIR WEB STORE. IN BALTIMORE LOCAL MERCHANTS HAVE LAUNCHED A KIND OF BUYBACK PROGRAM TO GET RICE JERSEYS OFF THE STREET.
Jon: RICEARONI IS CHANGING ITS NAME. IT WILL NOW BE REFERRED TO AS SIMMERED GRAIN-A-RONI. RICE UNIVERSITY WILL NOW BE REFERRED TO AS THE UNIVERSITY WHERE WE DO NOT PUNCH LADIES IN ELEVATORS. WHERE TO TURN. WHERE TO TURN. THAT IS AN UNWIELDY NAME FOR A UNIVERSITY. WHERE TO TURN FOR PERSPECTIVE ON A CASE LIKE THIS. WELL, THIS BEING THE NFL, IT TURNS OUT YOU COULD TURN TO ANOTHER MAN NAMED RAY WHO PLAYED FOR THE BALTIMORE RAVENS AND WAS ALSO PUNISHED FOR HIS PART IN A VIOLENT CRIME.
PEOPLE WILL TRY TO DRAW THIS COMPARISON, HOW DO YOU SEE THAT.
THERE IS NO COMPARISON, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO COMPARISON OF ME AND RAY RICE. IT'S NIGHT AND DAY. IT'S NIGHT AND DAY OF ANYTHING WE'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY BOTH SITUATIONS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
Jon: HOW DARE YOU SAY WE'RE THE SAME? I WOULD NEVER HIT A WOMAN! I WOULD OBSTRUCT JUSTICE IN A MURDER CASE BUT THAT-- BUT THAT IS WHERE I DRAW THE LINE. (LAUGHTER) MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT VIDEO IS-- IS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
STEVE, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION?
OOF. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: OOF INDEED. BUT HERE'S MY MAIN QUESTION. BACK IN JULY THE NFL FELT THIS CRIME WAS ONLY WORTHY OF A TWO GAME SUSPENSION. BUT NOW SUDDENLY IT'S A LIFETIME OF EXILE. SO WHAT CHANGED?
DID YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE A VIDEOTAPE OF RAY RICE PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE TO MAKE THIS DECISION?
NO, WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T. AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT WHAT WE SAW IN THE FIRST VIDEOTAPE WAS TROUBLING TO US IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR, IS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC, AND IT WAS SICKENING. AND THAT'S WHY WE TOOK THE ACTION WE TOOK YESTERDAY.
Jon: SO YOU DID NEED TO SEE RAY RICE PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE TO MAKE THIS DECISION WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY HADN'T YOU SEEN THAT VIDEO.
WE ASKED FOR VIDEO, BUT WE WERE NEVER GRANTED THAT OPPORTUNITY.
Jon: GRANTED THAT OPPORTUNITY. YOU WERE NEVER GRANTED THAT OPPORTUNITY. REALLY? THE KING OF VIDEO NEVER BESTOWED UPON YOU THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU ARE JUST A SIMPLE PEASANT BOY COMMISSIONER ARMED WITH ONLY YOUR WIT, THE CLOTHES UPON YOUR BACK AND BILLIONS IN DOLLARS WORTH OF THE MOST HIGH-POWERED TEAM OF LAWYERS IN THE HISTORY OF MAN. OH, LITTLE OLIVER. PLEASE, SIR, PLEASE, SIR. (APPLAUSE) MAY I? PLEASE, SIR, MAY I SEE THE TAPE? THE TAPE, NO! HERE'S THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT STORY.
THE AP IS NOW REPORTING THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL DID, INDEED, SEND A COPY OF THE RAY RICE VIDEO TO AN NFL EXECUTIVE BACK IN APRIL.
Jon: YOU DONE [BLEEP] UP. WELL IT ONLY MAKES SENSING APRIL, THAT'S THE OFF SEASON. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU HAD THE TAPE, AND YOU WANT US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU DID NOT LOOK AT IT? WELL, I THINK WE'RE ALL PRETTY AWARE OF THE NFL'S OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE TAPE WATCHING ADDICTIONS. FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOU GET 24 ANGLES AND HIGH RES SLOW MOTION JUST TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT A MAN'S KNEE GOES OVER AN IMAGINARY LINE BEFORE HIS HAND CROSSES A DIFFERENT IMAGINARY LINE. AND THAT IN STADIUM SYSTEM HAS A BUILT-IN REMOTE BACKUP.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CALL IS CHALLENGED THE NFL OFFICIATING COMMAND CENTER IN NEW YORK WILL BEGIN REVIEWING REPLAYS.
Jon: THE NFL OFFICIATING COMMAND CENTER. YOU'D THINK THEY WERE LAUNCHING NUKES RATHER THAN CONFIRMING IF THE BALL HAD, INDEED, TOUCHED THE GROUND FIRST. (LAUGHTER) SO NFL, PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU ATTEMPT TO BURY THE DAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LEAGUE'S CONDUCT, I GUESS WE'LL KNOW TO THROW THE RED CHALLENGE FLAG. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
