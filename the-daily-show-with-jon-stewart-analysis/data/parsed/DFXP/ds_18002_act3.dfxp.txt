Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, HIS NEW MOVIE  IS CALLED "TAKEN 2."
WHERE'S MOM?
SHE'S FINE. SHE'S NOT FAR. >>S WHERE SHE?
COME ON, KIM, MOVE!
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
WE HAVE TO GO TO THE EMBASSY.
I'M NOT SURE I CAN.
YOU KNOW HOW TO SHOOT?
NO.
THEN DRIVE. >>
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE  THE SUBWAY. (LAUGHTER)  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM LIAM NEESON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HOW YOU BEEN?
THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS.
Jon: THANK YOU. OH, THE EMMY THING? VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY. A GENTLEMAN IN THE AUDIENCE  TONIGHT WANTED TO KNOW WHY I  DIDN'T RECEIVE AN EMMY FOR MY  WORK ON "THE FACULTY." (LAUGHTER)  WHICH IS THE WRONG QUESTION ON  SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS. (LAUGHTER)  THAT -- THAT WAS THE KIND OF  THING "TAKEN 2" WHAT TYPE OF  AWARDS DO YOU THINK -- ARE THERE AWARDS FOR KICKING SO MUCH ASS  IN A MOVIE? (LAUGHTER)  THE ASSIES, MAYBE?
THERE'S AN IDEA.
Jon: WHAT DID THEY TAKE  THIS TIME? THE LAST TIME THEY TOOK YOUR  DAUGHTER.
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL  IT TOO MUCH WITH THE AUDIENCE  BUT --
Jon: FAMILY? WHOLE FAMILY?
FAMILY. ALL OF US.
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS:  SO THE FIRST MOVIE THEY TAKE  YOUR DAUGHTER. OKAY THAT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY. (LAUGHTER)  BUT BY THE SECOND TIME ONCE THEY  TAKE YOUR FAMILY, I'M STARTING  TO THINK YOU GUYS ARE  IRRESPONSIBLE. (LAUGHTER)  I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT THIS  IS AN ISSUE OF LACK OF PERSONAL  CONTROL.
IT'S BAD PARENTING. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, WHAT'S WRONG  WITH THE SUBWAY SYSTEM? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BY THE WAY, WHERE WAS  THAT TAXI -- WHERE WAS THAT --
ISTANBUL IN TURKEY.
Jon: SO IN ISTANBUL. SO IF YOUR DAUGHTER, AN AMERICAN  WOMAN, IS DRIVING A TAXI IN  ISTANBUL DO THEY GO "THESE  FOREIGN DRIVERS"?
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THAT,  YEAH.
Jon: DU HOWE DID YOU LIKE  ISTANBUL.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
Jon: I WOULD LOVE TO GO  THERE.
IT'S A REALLY AMAZING CITY.
Jon: HAD YOU BEEN THERE  PREVIOUSLY?
I'D NEVER BEEN BUT I READ UP  ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW; IT USED TO BE  CONSTANTINOPLE, THE GATEWAY FROM  THE WEST TO THE EAST. IT'S INCREDIBLE CULTURE AND  HISTORY.
Jon: DO THEY HAVE  CHICK-FIL-A? (LAUGHTER)  WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF -- DO YOU  IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE LOCAL  CULTURE? WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE FOOD THAT  YOU HAD?
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT MY  FAVORITE FOOD WAS? IT WAS A CHICKEN WRAP EVERY  NIGHT.
Jon: CHICKEN WRAP EVERY  NIGHT.
YES.
Jon: YOU'RE A MAN OF SIMPLE  PLEASURES.
VERY SIMPLE.
Jon: WAS IT TURKISH? WAS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT IT --
IT WAS KIND OF A LITTLE SPICE  TO IT.
Jon: CUMIN. IT'S CUMIN.
IT WASN'T CUMIN.
Jon: NO, IT'S CUMIN. IT'S CUMIN. (LAUGHTER)  BELIEVE ME, I READ AN AWFUL LOT  ABOUT -- IT'S CUMIN. (LAUGHTER)
I'M NOT SURE.
Jon: LEAVES A LITTLE BIT OF  THAT --
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. (LAUGHTER)  LEAVES YOUR TEETH A LITTLE BIT  YELLOW, TOO, ACTUALLY.
Jon: DID YOU EVER SEE  "MIDNIGHT EXPRESS"?
I DID, YEAH.
Jon: I AM ALWAYS AFRAID  THAT I'LL GO TO TURKEY AND AS  I'M LEAVING, LIKE, THEY'LL PULL  MY SHIRT UP AND I'LL HAVE LIKE FOR NO REASON HASH BRICKS. (LAUGHTER)  STRAPPED TO MY STOMACH. I JUST -- BECAUSE THAT MOVIE TO  THIS DAY --
IT'S SCARY.
Jon: -- FREAKS ME OUT.
I WATCHED IT QUITE RECENTLY,  TOO.
Jon: DID YOU REALLY.
IT PACKS A PUNCH.
Jon: WHAT WERE YOU UP LATE?
EXACTLY, 3:00 IN THE MORNING,  YOU CAN'T SLEEP AND IT COMES ON  YOU'RE LIKE, OH, YEAH. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT MOVIE  THAT IS FOR ME? I HAVE SEEN "SHAW SHAWSHANK  REDEMPTION LIKE" MAYBE -- HAVE  YOU SEEN IT? I'VE SEEN "SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION  700 TIMES."
3:00 IN THE MORNING.
Jon: RIGHT, WHEN I CAN'T  SLEEP.
IT'S A GOOD MOVIE, ISN'T IT? AND I WATCHED THAT WITH MY  ELDEST SON MAYBE FIVE WEEKS AGO. IT CAME ON AND WE BOTH LOOKED AT  EACH OTHER AND WENT "YEAH, LET'S  WATCH THIS."  IT HAS THAT EFFECT.
Jon: YOU AND THE BOY SIT UP  AND WATCH T.V. LATE AT NIGHT? DO YOU HANG OUT LIKE FRIENDS?
YEAH, SOMETIMES. THE WEEKENDS, OF COURSE.
Jon: YOU GET ALONG.
YEAH.
Jon: HOW OLD? WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH?
16 AND 17.
Jon: AND THEY STILL LIKE  YOU? BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT THAT'S  WHEN THE TURN HAPPENS. LIKE 14, 15, 16 IS WHEN THE TURN  HAPPENS AND THEY KIND OF GET A  LITTLE LIKE "DAD, I'M NOT  WATCHING THAT MOVIE, THAT'S A STUPID MOVIE."  LIKE THAT KIND OF -- THEY DON'T  GIVE THE ATTITUDE?
I DON'T GET THAT FROM THEM.
Jon: IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE  6' 5? (LAUGHTER)
6' 4. DOESN'T MATTER.
Jon: YEAH, IT MATTERS. (LAUGHTER)  NO, IT'S GOOD, IT'S GOOD.
THEY WEAR MY SHOES.
Jon: HOW BIG ARE THESE  KIDS?
I'M WEARING A 12 SO THEY'RE  -- THEY'RE GETTING UP TO SIX  FEET.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU THIS. I WOULD NOT PEG YOU AS A 12,  QUITE FRANKLY. THAT -- FOR A MAN OF 6' 4 AND A  BROAD-BASED MAN, THAT'S LIKE  HAVING LITTLE BABY FEET. THAT'S NOT --  (LAUGHTER). I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T FALL  OVER WALKING OUT HERE. I DIDN'T REALIZE. YOU'VE GOT NO CENTER OF GRAVITY. (LAUGHTER)  WHEN WE GO TO COMMERCIAL, I MAY  HAVE A GO AT YOU. (LAUGHTER)  I MAY GET IN LOW --  (LAUGHTER). YOU STILL WRESTLE THE BOYS?
OH, YEAH.
Jon: YOU STILL ROUGH HOUSE?
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.
Jon: I LOVE DOING THAT  BECAUSE THEY'RE EIGHT AND SIX SO  I'M --
OH, PERFECT.
Jon: I'M TOTALLY KICKING  THEIR ASS. (LAUGHTER)
IT'S WHEN YOU HEAR "DAD,  CHASE ME" AND THEY'RE 16 YEARS  OF AGE.
Jon: (LAUGHS)  "CHASE ME, I'VE GOT WINGS!"  (LAUGHTER)  "TAKEN 2" IS IN THE THEATERS ON  FRIDAY. "TAKEN 3 --"  (LAUGHTER)  ALL RIGHT. LIAM NEESON, EVERYBODY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
