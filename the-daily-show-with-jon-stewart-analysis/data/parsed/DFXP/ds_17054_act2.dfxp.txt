( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Stephen:  WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. NOW, AS YOU JUST SAW EARLIER, LAST NIGHT MITT ROMNEY WON BIG IN FLORIDA, CEMENTING HIS FRONT-RUNNER STATUS AND TODAY IT  WAS ON TO THE MORNING SHOWS FOR A QUICK VICTORY LAP.
BY THE WAY, I'M IN THIS RACE BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT AMERICANS. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY POOR. WE HAVE A SAFETY NET THERE. IF IT NEEDS REPAIR, I'LL FIX IT. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY RICH, THEY'RE DOING JUST FINE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  DID YOU JUST SUGGEST YOU DON'T NEED TO CARE ABOUT THE VERY RICH BECAUSE  THEY'RE FINE BUT ALSO EQUIVALENTLY THE VERY POOR BECAUSE THEY'RE OKAY, TOO? BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE REASON THE NET IS THERE IS THEY'RE NOT OKAY. ( LAUGHTER ) IT'S LIKE A DOCTOR GOING,UN," I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY  HEALTHY BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING FINE, OR THE VERY SICK BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MORPHINE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING." BUT MAYBE I HEARD IT WRONG. I COULD HAVE HEARD IT WRONG. DOES DTHAT SOUND WEIRD TO ANYBODY ELSE.
YOU JUST SAID, "I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY POOR  BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SAFETY NET." AND I THINK THERE ARE LOT OF VERY POOR AMERICANS WHO ARE  STRUGGLING WHO WOULD SAY THAT SOUNDS ODD. YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  TV NEWS PERSON JUST HEARD WHAT CANDIDATE SAID AND THEN STOPPED HIM AND MADE HIM  EXPLAIN HIMSELF. LIKE A FLOWER BLOOMING IN THE DESERT. QUICK! SOMEONE DIG THAT UP AND GET IT AWAY FROM CNN BEFORE ONE OF THEIR GIANT HOLOGRAPHIC MONITORS  FALLS AND CRUSHES IT.
WELL, YOU HAD TO FINISH THE SENTENCE, SOLEDAD. I SAID I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERY POOR THAT HAVE A SAFETY  NET, BUT IF IT HAS HOLES IN IT, I WILL REPAIR THEM.
Jon:  RIGHT, BUT IT'S STILL A ( BLEEP ) NET! AND HERE'S THE THING ABOUT BEING IN A NET. BEING IN A NET IS BAD, WHETHER YOU'RE A BUTTERFLY OR A FISH OR A TRATEASE ARTIST OR A POOR PERSON. IF YOU'RE IN A NET, SOMETHING HAS GONE TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY WRONG. YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SURE IF ROMNEY GETS A CHANCE TO CLARIFY HIS STATEMENT HE'LL  IN NO AWAY WREN REIN FORCE HIS ARISTOCRATIC PARTITION MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE-ISH-NESS.
WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEMOCRAT PARTY THE PLIGHT OF THE POOR. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION, IT'S NOT GOOD BEING POOR.
Stephen:
Jon:  THEY'VE GOT TO PLAY TENNIS ON PUBLIC COURTS. RIDE RENTAL PONIES WHEN THEIR BUTLERS TUCK THEM IN AT NIGHT, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE THREAD  COUNT ON THEIR LINENS. MY POINT IS WE DON'T NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. FOR MORE ON MITT ROMNEY'S APPARENT CONFLATION OF THE VERY RICH AND VERY POOR AS  CONSTITUENCIES UNNEEDED OF ATTENTION WE'RE JOINED BY JASON JONES AND JHN OLIVER. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) WE'RE GOING TO START HERE. TEAM VERY POOR, WE'RE GOING TO START WITH YOU.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! NICE TRY, STEWART. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO PLAY YOUR LITTLE CLASS WARFARE EXPERIMENT.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU DIVIDE US.
Jon:  I'M NOT TRYING TO DIVIDE YOU BUT YOU BOTH REPRESENT THE TWO MOST EXTREME  SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS IN THIS COUNTRY.
DON'T TRY TO PIT THE 1% AGAINST THE EQUIVALENT 1%.
Jon:  ACTUALLY, I THINK YOUR NUMBERS MIGHT BE OFF. YOU'RE 1%, BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY LARGER. VERY POOR IS, LIKE 7%, POVERTY IS LIKE 15%.
NO, NO, WE'RE EXACTLY THE SAME. WE'RE TWO PEAS IN A POD.
BUGS IN MY BED.
I SAY POTATO.
AND I SAY DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SAY POTATO BECAUSE I COULD EAT THE HELL OUTAVE POTATO RIGHT NOW. I AM MASSIVELY HUNGRY.
Jon:  SO BOTH OF YOU ARE OKAY WITH GOVERNOR ROMNEY SAYING EACH OF THESE CONSTITUENCIES CAN  BE IGNORED BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING OKAY.
ABSOLUTELY, YES. I MEAN, I CAN TAKE ALL MY MASSIVE REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS AND DEFER THE TAXES THROUGH 1031  EXCHANGES AND MINIMIZE MY I.R.S. EXPOSURE THROUGH MY CAYMEN ISLAND SUBSIDIARIES AND AN ALMOST SARCASTIC AMOUNT OF TRUSTS. SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'M FINE. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  JOHN?
WELL, I RECEIVE $12 PER DAY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. SO NO WORRIES ABOUT ME. PRETTY COMFORTABLE SAFETY NET. TWINSIES!
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY IS I HAVE A NET, TOO. IT'S MORE LIKE A GOLDEN PARACHUTE. BUT SAME IDEA. OUR LIKE EXPERIENCES ARE INCREDIBLY SIMILAR.
YEAH, WE BOTH LOVE TO FISH.
THAT'S RIGHT. LAST WEEK, I WENT FISHING FOR MARLIN DOWN IN KEY WEST.
AND JUST YESTERDAY I WAS UNDER A BRIDGE IN THE EAST RIVER TRYING TO AUGMENT MY PROTEIN INTAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) I CAUGHT A BOOT AND A USED CONDOM. ( LAUGHTER ). DELICIOUS.
UHHH, WELL, WE BOTH LIKE BASEBALL.
YES, WE BOTH LOVE "MODERN FAMILY."
WHO DOESN'T.
AND WE'RE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.
YUP-- WAIT, WHAT? HOW THE ( BLEEP ) IS THAT POSSIBLE? ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY IT COSTS TO GET THAT KIND OF STUFF THROUGH.
HE'S RIGHT THERE, TO BE FAIR. RIGHT.
Jon:  BUT YOU SEE NO DIFFERENCE THAN IN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE?
NO, YOU CAN'T DIVIDE US WITH YOUR CLASS WARFARE. ( CLEARS THROAT )  ♪ I AM RICH  ♪ AND I AM POOR   ♪ WHEN WE GO HOME WE BOTH WALK THROUGH FRONT DOORS  ♪ MINE IS SOLID MAHOGANY  I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DOOR ( LAUGHTER ).
IT'S TRUE. IT'S A BEADED CURTAIN  ♪ I AM PAUL.
AND I AM RICH.
I LIKE FOIS GRAS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.  ♪ SO PLEASE DON'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT US 'CAUSE WE'RE BOTH OKAY. ♪ EXCEPT FOR ME I'M NOT OKAY. I'M NOT OKAY AT ALL. IT IS NOT OKAY. IT IS NOT OKAY  ♪ ♪.
