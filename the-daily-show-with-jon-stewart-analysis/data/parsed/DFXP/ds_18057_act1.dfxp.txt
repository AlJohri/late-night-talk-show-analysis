Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL    FROM COMEDY  CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST ED WHITACRE HE'S  ON AS FORMER CHAIRMAN AND C.E.O. OF GM AND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF  BOARD AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT  AT&T. I'M GOING TO SPEND THE ENTIRE  INTERVIEW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  WHY I CAN'T GET CELL SERVICE ON THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY. YOU KNOW EVERY NOW AND THEN A  REPORT COMES OUT THAT WE KILLED  AL QAEDA'S NUMBER THREE GUY FROM THE FIFTH TIME FROM ABOVE A  MISSILED ROBOT PLANE OR WE  MISSED HIM AND MISTAKENLY HIT A FACTORY THAT MAKES CIVILIANS? [LAUGHTER] WELL, YOU MIGHT WONDER:  IS THAT  OKAY?
NBC NEWS HAS OBTAINED A  GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT THAT LAYS  OUT THE LEGAL ARGUEMENT TO JUSTIFY THE PRESIDENT'S USE OF  DRONES TO KILL AL QAEDA SUSPECTS  INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, U.S. CITIZENS.
Jon: U.S. WHAT NOW? U.S. WHO? I NEVER THOUGHT SOME OF THE  TERRORISTS COULD BE PEOPLE ON  AMERICA'S GOT TALENT. YOU HAVE TO BE AMERICAN TO BE ON  AMERICA'S GOT TALENT, DON'T YOU?   OTHERWISE IT'S CUBA'S GOT  TALENT. I BET IT'S SPECIFIC ABOUT WHEN  THEY CAN ORDER THE KILLING.
THE KILLING IS ALLOWED IF  THEY ARE LEADERS OF AL QAEDA AND  AN -- OR AN ASSOCIATED TERROR  GROUP.
Jon: NO WORRIES THEY WON'T  KILL YOU UNLESS YOU ARE PART OF  THE AL QAEDA PARENT COMPANY. AL QAEDA IN IRAQ, AL QAEDA IN  LIBYA, EURO AL QAEDA, CHIPOTLE. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, REALLY THEY ARE NOT PART  OF -- I THOUGHT AL QAEDA BOUGHT  THAT FROM McDONALDS? EITHER WAY IT'S DELICIOUS. [ LAUGHTER ] LEST YOU WORRY THAT WE'RE BEING  TOO GENERAL ABOUT WHO WE CAN  TARGET AND IT'S TOO LATE TO CANCEL YOUR INCREDIBLY  ILL-ADVISED SPRING BREAK TRIP TO  THE YEMEN SANDALS. [LAUGHTER] THE LEAKED DOCUMENT LAYS OUT  CLEAR LIMITATIONS OF WHEN  TERRORISTS CAN BE TARGETED. WE ONLY TAKE THESE KINDS OF  ACTIONS WHEN THERE'S AN IMMINENT  THREAT.
Jon: IMMINENT THREAT. BY DEFINITION THAT REQUIRES  CLEAR EVIDENCE TO A SPECIFIC  ATTACK ON U.S. PERSONS AND INTERESTS WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE  IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
AN IMMINENT THREAT DOES NOT  REQUIRE THE UNITED STATES TO  HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT A SPECIFIC ATTACK ON U.S. PERSONS  AND INTERESTS WILL TAKE PLACE IN  THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: REALLY BECAUSE THAT  SEEMS LIKE IF YOU DID THAT YOU  WOULD HAVE TO CREATE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION FOR THE WORD  IMMINENT, A BROADER CONCEPT, IF  YOU WILL.
THEY USE THE PHRASE BROADER  CONCEPT OF IMMINENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SO IMMINENT THREAT, IN  OTHER WORDS IMMINENT OR NOT  IMMINENT, BROADLY SPEAKING. IMMINENT IN THE GEE LOGICAL  SENSE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE CAN KILL AN AMERICAN WHO IS  AL QAEDA OR AL QAEDA ADJACENT IF  THEY POSE AN IMMINENT DANGER MEANING EVENTUALLY, I IMAGINE  THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS TO  DETERMINE WHO WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO OUR, FOR LACK OF A BETTER  TERM SKY MILES PROGRAM, IS  SOMEWHAT STRING GENT INCLUDING DUE PROCESS AND OVERSIGHT.
WITHOUT DUE PROCESS, NO  COURT, NO TRIALING AND  RELATIVELY LITTLE OVERSIGHT.
Jon: IT'S AN OPEN  ADMISSIONS PROCESS. DO WE AT LEAST YELL FORE! HEADS UP! THIS IS FREAKING ME OUT A LITTLE  BIT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF  THE MEMOS AND I KNOW THE  ADMINISTRATION WILL SHOW THE PRESENT DOCUMENTS TO US BECAUSE  WE HAVE THEIR RECORDS ON SUCH  TOUCHY WAR ON TERROR GLOBAL DISCLOSURES TO GO BY.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS  RELEASED THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION  MEMOS THAT AUTHORIZED THE C.I.A. TO USE HARSH INTERROGATION  METHODS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA PERSONAL LAY  PROVED RELEASING THE MEMOS IN  SUCH DETAIL.
Jon: PERSONALLY. HE INVITED EVERYONE TO THE MEMO  RELEASE PARTISM IT'S AN  INVITATION. ALTHOUGH, IRONICALLY, GUEST LIST  WAS CLASSIFIED. [LAUGHTER] NOW LISTEN:  WE KNOW HOW THIS  ADMINISTRATION FEELS ABOUT THE  EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITHHOLDING MEMOS FROM CONGRESS BECAUSE OF  THE 2004 ON THE TORTUREOS.
WILL BE PROVIDE -- TORTURE  MEMOS.
WILL YOU PROVIDE THESE TO THE  COMMITTEE?
NO I WILL NOT.
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED UNDER OUR  CONSTITUTION NOT TO ANSWER OUR  QUESTIONS AND THAT AIN'T  CONSTITUTIONAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BY THE WAY THAT'S THE  NAME OF HIS ONE-MAN OFF BROADWAY  SHOW. AIN'T CONSTITUTIONAL. YOU SHOULD HAVE TAGGED IT WITH  THAT AIN'T CONSTITUTIONAL MOTHER  (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] I THINK THAT ANSWERS THE  QUESTION OF WHETHER THE OBAMA  BIDEN WHITE HOUSE WILL RELEASE THE MEMOS DETAILING IN SPECIFICS  OUR DRONE STRIKES POLICY.
WILL PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASE  THE MEMOS?
I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU ON  ALLEGED MEMOS REGARDING POE TEN  SALLY CLASSIFIED MATTERS. WITHOUT GOING INTO THE ALLEGED  EXISTENCE OF ANY PARTICULAR MEMO  OR ACTION I CAN SAY THAT WHAT WE CAN NOT DO IS DISCUSS CLASSIFIED  OPERATIONS.
Jon: ALLEGED MEMOS DID YOU  JUST GO JEDI MIND TRICK ON US? THESE ARE NOT THE DRONES YOU ARE  LOOK FOR. TELL YOU SOMETHING CARNEY, YOU  ARE GOOD BUT YOU ARE NO SITH  LORD. YES, MASTER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WORSE, THE  ALARMINGLY AMBIGUOUS GUIDELINES  FOR THE STRIKE PROGRAM OR THE FACT THAWR SAYING WE MIGHT NOT  HAVE WRITTEN THESE DOWN IN MEMO  FORM. SURELY THERE ARE MEMOS ON THIS.
THERE ARE LEGAL MEMOS WRITTEN  BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON  THIS KILLING JUST AS THERE WERE LEGAL MEMOS UNDER THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE USE OF  TORTURE.
Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT. THOUGH OBVIOUSLY THIS IS  DIFFERENT FROM THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION SECRET WAR POLICY IN THAT I ASSUME THE DEMOCRATS  HAVE WRITTEN THEM ON RECYCLED  PAPER. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW THEY ARE VERY  RESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT WERE THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION'S REASONS FOR  LETTING THE BUSH TORTURE MEMOS  OUT?
THE TRUTH IS THAT BECAUSE  THESE WERE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
Jon: OKAY TO MAKE MATERIAL  PUBLIC WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS  ABOUT IT AND WE'RE COVERED THERE BECAUSE THE NORKTS RELEASED THIS  MEMO ON DRONE STRIKES. WE'RE GOOD. RELEASE THEM. WHAT SNELS.
EVEN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION  HAS REVEALED THE MOST SERIOUS  ASPECTS OF THIS.
Jon: PRECEDENT NUMBER TWO  THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FESSED UP  TO DOING IT AND OBAMA HAS DONE EVERYTHING SHORT OF TAKING OUT A  BILLBOARD ABOUT THE DRONE  PROGRAMS. I THINK WE ARE OKAY THERE, TOO. I THINK WE'RE DOING PRETTY G. AND WHAT IS THE LAST REASON?
THERE WAS NO LEGAL RATIONAL  FOR KEEPING THEM CLASSIFIED.
Jon: OH. SO WE DON'T HE MIND YOU KNOWING  ABOUT (bleep) WE DON'T DO ONCE  WE DON'T DO IT NIX WE TOLD YOU WE WOULD BE TRANSPARENT WE JUST  DIDN'T TELL
