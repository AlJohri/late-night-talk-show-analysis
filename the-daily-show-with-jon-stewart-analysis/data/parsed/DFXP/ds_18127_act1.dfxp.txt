Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART."  CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY  COMEDY CENTRAL [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW."  I AM JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART, I'M AFRAID, STILL  NOT HERE. HE IS CURRENTLY WAITING TO  EMERGE FROM KATE MIDDLETON'S  VAGINA. PUSH, PRINCESS, PUSH! OUR GUEST TONIGHT, AUTHOR OF THE  NEW LOOK "ZEALOT" ABOUT THE LIFE  OF JESUS, THE FANTASTIC REZA ALSAN IS WITH US. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
John: YES, INDEED, YES,  INDEED. FRIEND OF THE SHOW. BUT WE START TONIGHT IN NEW YORK  CITY, WHERE IT IS SO HOT AND  THIS IS A TRUE STORY, THAT ON MY WAY TO WORK THIS MORNING, I SAW  A SQUIRREL STAB A PIGEON OVER A  PIECE OF ICE. [LAUGHTER] IT IS SO HOT HERE, YOU CAN COOK  AN EGG ON THE SIDEWALK, ASSUMING  THAT YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS OVER  HEPATITIS. [LAUGHTER] SERIOUSLY, IT IS UNBELIEVABLY [BLEEPED] HOT HERE. NOW, TO TAKE OUR MINDS OFF THE  HEAT, WE HAVE A VERY EXCITING  ELECTION LOOMING IN THE CITY, AND THIS IS WHY TONIGHT WE'RE  GOING TO START OFF OUR SPECIAL  CAMPAIGN COVERAGE. ♪♪   ♪♪  YES, OH YES. [APPLAUSE] THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION. WHO WILL BE THE NEXT NEW YORK  CITY COMPTROLLER? I'M ACTUALLY BEING TOLD THAT  IT'S PRONOUNCED "CONTROLLER."  I'M NOW BEING TOLD THAT THAT'S MATTER OF SOME LINGUISTIC  DISPUTE. [LAUGHTER] I'M NOW BEING TOLD THAT  ABSOLUTELY NOBODY CARES HOW IT'S  PRONOUNCED BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST BORING JOB ON THE PLANET. NOW, A WEEK AGO IT WAS ALL BUT  CERTAIN THAT THE POSITION WOULD  BE FILLED BY MANHATTAN BOROUGH PRESIDENT SCOTT SOMEBODY OR  OTHER. NOBODY KNOWS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. AND A WEEK AGO IT WAS ALSO ALL  BUT CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS NO  WAY THAT WE WOULD BE COVERING THIS RACE ON THIS SHOW, BUT THEN  THIS HAPPENED.
THE FORMER NEW YORK  DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ELIOT  SPITZER IS TRYING FOR A  COMEBACK. HE LAUNCHED A PETITION CAMPAIGN  TODAY IN A BID TO BECOME NEW  YORK CITY'S COMPTROLLER.
John: THAT'S RIGHT, ELIOT  SPITZER IS RUNNING FOR OFFICE  AGAIN, AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, THAT IS A BOLD MOVE FOR MAN STILL  LIVING DOWN THE HIDEOUS,  EMBARRASSING, CAREER-KILLING INCIDENT WHERE HE AND A... I  DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS. YOU MUST REMEMBER, HE CO-HOSTED  A CNN SHOW WITH KATHLEEN PARKER. [LAUGHTER] THE SHAME HE PUT HIS FAMILY  THROUGH. OH, AND OF COURSE THERE WAS ALSO  THAT THING WHEN HE BANGED A  BUNCH OF PROSTITUTES WITH HIS SOCKS ON. IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT LAST LITTLE  SEXUAL SNAFU THAT SPITZER KICKED  OFF HIS CAMPAIGN BY GOING ON JAY LENO FOR HIS OFFICIAL HUGH GRANT  MEMORIAL PROSTITUTE APOLOGY  TOUR.
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS BIG A  BLUNDER?
BIG A BLUNDZER? THAT'S A VERY NICE WAY OF  PUTTING IT. BUT I DON'T THINK BLUPSDER IS  THE RIGHT WORD. THERE IT'S NOT LIKE SPITZER  ACCIDENTALLY TRIPPED AND FELL  DONG FIRST INTO A PROSTITUTE ON AT LEAST EIGHT SEPARATE  OCCASIONS, BUT SPITZER MADE IT  CLEAR THAT HE WOULD RATHER FOCUS ON WHAT HE DID RIGHT.
MY NAME CAME UP IN A FEDERAL  INVESTIGATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO  HAD BEEN SEEING CLIENTS OF A PROSTITUTION RING, AND WHEN THIS  BECAME EVIDENT, I IMMEDIATELY  RESIGNED. I SAID, LOOK, MY CAREER AS  ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS PREDICATED  ON THE NOTION OF THE THINGS I'D DONE WITH WALL STREET AND  ELSEWHERE, ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I SAID, THAT IS A STANDARD  AND SOMETHING I BELIEVE IN.
John: YES, TRUE, THAT  REALLY DOES ILLUSTRATE PERFECTLY  HOW IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO ELIOT SPITZER, BECAUSE HE  RESIGNED THE MOMENT HE GOT  CAUGHT. [LAUGHTER] AS SOON AS HE REALIZED THAT  OTHER PEOPLE HAD REALIZED HE WAS  DOING SOMETHING WRONG, HE ACCEPTED THE CONSEQUENCES. AND HE FELL ON HIS SWORD, EIGHT  TIMES INTO PROSTITUTES. [LAUGHTER] NOW, SPITZER'S... LOOK, CLEARLY  SPITZER HAS GOT HIS WORK CUT OUT  FOR HIM HERE. BUT MAYBE HE'LL BE OKAY AS LONG  AS HIS OPPONENTS ARE WILLING TO  FOCUS ON THE ISSUES RATHER THAN ON HIS PAST MISTAKES.
AND GET THIS, SPITZER IS  CHALLENGED FOR THE POST BY  LIBERTARIAN KRISTIN DAVIS, WHO SAYS SHE WAS THE MADAM WHO  SUPPLIED HIM WITH ESCORTS.
OH, BOY. REALLY? HE'S RUNNING? I WILL SAY, SHE REALLY IS THE  CLASSIC ARCHETYPAL SEXY  LIBERTARIAN. TAKES OFF HER GLASSES, SHAKES  OUT HER HAIR AND WON'T PAY HER  TAXES, OH, YEAH! INCIDENTALLY, IT SHOWS JUST HOW  STRANGE THIS CAMPAIGN IS THAT IN  THE RACE TO DECIDE WHO WOULD BE BEST SUITED TO MAKE FINANCIAL  DECISIONS FOR NEW YORK CITY, THE  SERIOUS CANDIDATE IS THE GUY WHO SPENT $4,000 FOR ONE SESSION  WITH A HOOKER RATHER THAN THE  WOMAN WHO FIGURED OUT THAT HE WOULD PAY IT. WAIT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, WAIT A  SECOND. SERIOUS CANDIDATE? NEW YORK CITY? WHY IS THIS REMINDING ME OF  SOMETHING?
IF SPITZER MAKES SEPTEMBER'S  PRIMARY, HE'LL BE ON THE BALLOT  WITH FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ANTHONY WEINER, WHO  IS ALSO TRYING TO MAKE A  COMEBACK FROM A SEX SCANDAL. HE'S RUNNING FOR THE MAYOR OF  NEW YORK.
John: THAT'S IT! ANTHONY WEINER. I REMEMBER HIM. WASN'T HE THE HUMAN BEING  ATTACHED TO THAT PENIS THAT WE  ALL SAW PICTURES OF? YEAH, I REMEMBER HIM NOW. THE MAN WHOSE NAME IS SO PERFECT  FOR THE SCANDAL HE WAS CAUGHT UP  IN, IT RECINSDLED MY FAITH IN  GOD. [LAUGHTER] THIS WAS MAN WHO LITERALLY [BLEEPED] BLOCKED HIS OWN  CAREER, AND HE'S RUNNING FOR  MAYOR, AND UNLIKE ELIOT SPITZER,  HE'S... [LAUGHTER] YES. UNLIKE... YES. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M GUESSING, KNOWING THE  INTERNET, THOSE WILL BE  AVAILABLE FOR SALE TOMORROW. [LAUGHTER] UNLIKE ELIOT SPITZER, HE'S DOING  IT THE MORE TRADITIONAL BIG  APPLE WAY: GREETING NEW YORKERS AT THE ISRAEL DAY PARADE AND  ALSO AT THE GAY PRIDE PARADE  WHERE HE RECEIVED AN  ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION.
WEINER, WEINER, WEINER! [LAUGHTER]
John: WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW  WAS THAT NONE OF THOSE MEN  CHANTING "WEINER" WERE ACTUALLY AWARE THAT HE WAS MARCHING. AND BY THE WAY, CONGRESSMAN,  MAYBE TONE DOWN THE PANDERING  JUST A LITTLE BIT. THAT FLAG IS SO BIG IT LOOKS  LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO PLANT IT ON  THE GAY MOON. [LAUGHTER] THE POINT IS, IT WILL UNDENIABLY  BE ENTERTAINING TO HAVE WEINER  AND SPITZER RUNNING FOR OFFICE AGAIN GIVING THEIR PAST, THOUGH,  IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE EITHER OF  THEM ACTUALLY WINNING.
ANTHONY WEINER IS STEADILY  INCREASING HIS LEAD, PULLING  AHEAD OF CHRISTINE QUINN 25% TO  22%. ELIOT SPITZER BARELY HAS BEEN IN  THE RACE FOR A WEEK AND ALREADY  HE'S LEADING MANHATTAN BOROUGH PRESIDENT SCOTT STRINGER 48% TO  33%.
John: WOW. ANTHONY WEINER AND ELIOT SPITZER  SURPRISING EVERYONE WITH THEIR  SOLID POLLING. [LAUGHTER] WHICH, TO BE FAIR, IS KIND OF  THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES. FOR MORE ON THIS WE'RE JOINED BY  SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT  SAMANTHA BEE.
YEAH.
John: SAM, IT LOOK LIKE  WEINER AND SPITZER COULD  ACTUALLY WIN THEIR RACES. THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE, ISN'T IT?
I KNOW, JOHN, IT TRULY IS A  GREAT DAY FOR CHILDREN ACROSS  THIS NATION.
John: SORRY. HOW ON EARTH IS THIS A GREAT DAY  FOR CHILDREN?
OH, NO, JOHN, THINK ABOUT IT. MOST OF TODAY'S YOUNG PEOPLE  FEEL LIKE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE  A FUTURE IN POLITICS AND IT'S HARD TO ARGUE WITH THEM. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ON FACEBOOK  24/7. THEY'RE SEXTING AND TWITPICKING  AND OVERSHARING EVERYTHING  THEY'VE GOT AND DESTROYING ANY CHANCE OF A POLITICAL CAREER  BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW THEY WANT  ONE. EVERY PARENT DREADS THAT MOMENT  WHEN THEY HAVE TO SIT THEIR  COLLEGE-AGED KID DOWN AND SAY, HONEY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE  PRESIDENT OR EVEN CITY  COMPTROLLER BECAUSE YOU LIKE INSTAGRAM AND TEQUILA MAKES YOUR  CLOTHES FALL OFF.
John: I SEE. I SEE. SO IN A SENSE, PROSTITUTE  JOHNSON AND DICK PIC MCGEE ARE  TRAILBLAZERS?
YES. WEINER AND SPITZER ARE DOING IT  FOR GENERATION JUNK SHOT. REMEMBER THAT ICONIC PHOTO OF  THE LITTLE BOY TOUCHING OBAMA'S  HAIR BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE HIS  OWN. JON JON I ACTUALLY REMEMBER  THAT. THAT WAS A MOVING PHOTO.
WELL, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS  A THAT LONG-WAVING FRAT BOY  WAITING FOR HIS IDOL TO TELL HIM, YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME. YOU CAN BE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO  BE AND AMERICANS WILL JUDGE YOU  BY THE COLORFULNESS OF YOUR CHARACTER, NOT BY THE CONTENT OF  YOUR CAMERA PHONE.
John: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,  SAM. THANK YOU. SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYONE. IS A
