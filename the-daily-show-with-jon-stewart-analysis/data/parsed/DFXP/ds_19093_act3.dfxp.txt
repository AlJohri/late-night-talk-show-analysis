Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SHE'S THE COANCHOR OF ABC'S "GOOD MORNING AMERICA". HER NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM ROBIN ROBERTS. COME ON, HELLO. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HELLO!
Jon: WELL, HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
I'M SORRY OUT OF HABIT I SAID GOOD MORNING. I AM SORRY.
Jon: THEY DID JUST GET UP. I KNOW THESE PEOPLE. IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH TO 4:20 THAT THEY JUST GOT UP.
OH!
Jon: EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING, BUT MAN, NOT EVERYBODY'S GOT EVERYTHING. I MEAN, YOU REALLY GOT HIT WITH THE WHAMMIES OF WHAMMIES. A BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS THE FIRST WHAMMIE, YES?
IN 2007, YES. AND, I COMPLETED TREATMENT IN 2008. BUT THE REASON I SAID EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING. AND IT'S TRUE. YEAH, I GOT SLAPPED UPSIDE THE HEAD AND EVERYTHING. BUT THE POINT MY MOM SAID, IT DOESN'T MATTER. EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING. AND MY SOMETHING IS NO MORE IMPORTANT OR GREATER THAN ANY OTHER CHALLENGE THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS FACING. BUT, THERE WAS A POINT, I WILL AGREE, WHERE I WAS LOOKING UP TO THE HEAVENS AND SAYING, IF YOU WANT TO SPREAD IT AROUND A LITTLE BIT MORE, THAT WOULD BE FINE WITH ME.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT IS, IT'S, YOU KNOW, PARENTS CAN DELIVER THIS KIND OF SAGE ADVICE AND THEY CAN DO IT IN A BIT OF A VACUUM. BUT, I THINK THEY NEVER KNOW IF THEIR KIDS, YOU SEEMED TO HAVE ABSORBED YOUR PARENTS' LESSONS OF IT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU BUT THE WAY YOU DEAL WITH IT IN A WAY THAT MUST MAKE THEM INCREDIBLY PROUD.
WELL, BECAUSE MY PARENTS -- MY DAD GREW UP IN JERSEY. AND UH, YES.
Jon: I'M FAMILIAR.
AS A SMALL CHILD HE HAD THE NERVE TO CUT OFF A BROOM STICK HANDLE AND GO DOWN THE BASEMENT AND DREAM OF FLYING AND BECAME A TUSKEEGEE AIRMAN. MY MOTHER WAS THE FIRST IN HER FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND WAS ON THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. SO, I COME FROM GOOD STOCK, AND I KIND OF LISTENED TO THEM. NOT ALL THE TIME, I'LL ADMIT, AS A CHILD NOT SO MUCH, BUT I'M GRATEFUL THAT SOME OF THE LIFE LESSONS STAYED WITH ME. EVERY MORNING WHEN I ENTER THE STUDIO FOR "GOOD MORNING AMERICA" I BLOW A KISS TO BOTH OF THEM UP THERE AND SAY GOOD MORNING TO THEM BEFORE I SAY "GOOD MORNING AMERICA".
Jon: AND THEN WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH THAT DO YOU DOWN TO GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. I KNOW HE IS ONLY -- [LAUGHTER] HE'S LIKE -- HE'S --
I WAS WAITING FOR THAT. IT TOOK YOU A LITTLE LONGER THAN I THOUGHT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING. HE'S ACTUALLY A GOOD FRIEND. I HAVE TO GET HIM. LET ME GIVE HIM A CALL. [LAUGHTER] HE AND I ARE THE SAME SIZE, BY THE WAY.
THE FIRST CHRISTMAS GIFT HE GAVE ME SIX INCH HEELS. THAT'S THE KIND OF GOOD SPORT THAT HE IS.
Jon: THAT'S VERY NICE. DURING THAT TIME, WERE YOU THINKING TO YOURSELF, MAN, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK UP AT 3:00 A.M. AND GET TO WORK. [ LAUGHTER ]
NOT SO MUCH. IT WAS NICE TO HAVE THAT SIX MONTH BREAK. BUT THE POINT OF IT IS WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THAT, ESPECIALLY, AND I WAS OFF THE AIR FOR SIX MONTHS. CAN YOU IMAGINE NOT SITTING IN THAT CHAIR FOR SIX MONTHS? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YES. HOLD ON. [LAUGHTER]
COME BACK TO US, JON. COME BACK TO US.
Jon: I'M STANDING ON A COOL MOUNTAIN AND A BREEZE WAS GOING THROUGH MY HAIR. [LAUGHTER]
ALL I WANTED WAS TO BE NORMAL AGAIN. NORMAL FOR ME IS GETTING UP AT 3:45 AND GETTING IN THE STUDIO AND DOING WHAT I DO.
Jon: RIGHT. DID YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU LOST YOURSELF?
OH --
Jon: OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONAL YOU SORT OF BECAME OUTSIDE OF YOURSELF OR SOMETHING ELSE?
THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE DURING THE -- YOU KNOW, BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT WHAT THEY DO IS THEY COMPLETELY TAKE AWAY YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S DYSFUNCTIONAL AND IT'S GOING TO KILL YOU. THEY HAVE TO WIPE IT OUT. I WAS SO THANKFUL THAT MY SISTER WAS A PERFECT MATCH. SO THEY INSERTED HER STEM CELLS. AND IT'S LIKE A REBIRTH. SO I REALLY FELT LIKE I WAS COMING BACK TO LIFE, AND THERE WERE TIMES THAT I WAS JUST OUTSIDE OF MYSELF. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS ONE POINT I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND HALLUCINATING. I NURSE CAME IN AND SHE SAID I WAS INTERVIEWING WALTER CRONKITE AT THE FOOT OF MY BED. TRUE STORY. [LAUGHTER] YES, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I WAS OUTSIDE OF MY BODY FOR A WHILE.
Jon: AS YOU FELT IT COME BACK, IT'S SO NICE SEE YOU. MAN, YOUR SPIRIT AND ENERGY SHINES THROUGH EVERYTHING. IT'S LOVELY TO SEE YOU DOING SO WELL.
THANK YOU, JON.
Jon: GOOD TO SEE YOU. ROBIN ROBERTS "EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING." IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
