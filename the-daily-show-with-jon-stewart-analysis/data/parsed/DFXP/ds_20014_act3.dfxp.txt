THANK YOU. WELCOME TO TEXAS.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME. THE HOSPITALITY. THE MEAT, A VARIETY OF SMOKED MEATS WE HAVE ENJOYED.
DID YOU TRY THE BARBECUE AND THE TACOS AND EVERYTHING? Jon: I'M HOPING THAT'S WHAT WE WERE EATING. YES, I DON'T -- WE GOT IT FROM A TRUCK. SO I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S SAFE. YOU WILL BE FINE.
Jon: I'M SURE WE WILL BE FINE. AND IF NOT WE LEAVE FOR NEW YORK ANYWAYS. AND THEY WILL QUARANTINE US THERE. NOW, YOU HAVE A TWIN BROTHER WHO IS IN -- THE CABINET RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S RIGHT. MY BROTHER WAS MAYOR OF SAN ANTONIO.
Jon: YES.
NOW IN THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET OVER AT HUD. [ APPLAUSE ]
Jon: AND YOU GUYS, DO YOU EVER -- AND I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THIS. LIKE WITH TWINS. LIKE DO YOU EVER PLAY THE TWIN GAMES WHERE YOU LIKE FAKE PEOPLE OUT. AND THEN FOR LIKE A DAY HE LEGISLATES AND YOU MAKE HOUSING POLICY? BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'D BE FUN.
I WISH I COULD SEND HIM OVER TO CONGRESS AND I COULD GO TO HUD.
Jon: YES.
BUT NO, WE HAVEN'T.
Jon: YOU HATE, YOU HATE CONGRESS.
YOU KNOW, IT COULD OF BEEN A BETTER YEAR.
Jon: IT'S TERRIBLE.
IT'S BEEN TOUGH, YEAH.
Jon: IT'S A TERRIBLE -- WHAT, SO THE TEXAS DELEGATION. DO YOU HAVE TO RIDE TO WASHINGTON? IS GOHMERT IN THE BACK JUST LIKE ANCHOR BABY, ANCHOR BABY? LIKE, LIKE WHAT IS IT LIKE?
I THINK LOUIE IS ON A DIFFERENT FLIGHT THAN I AM.
Jon: I DON'T IMAGINE HE NEEDS A PLANE. NOW YOU GUYS HAD YOUR -- DIDN'T NANCY PELOSI HAVE THE CALL WITH THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC DELEGATION TODAY.
SHE DID.
Jon: SHE DID DO THAT.
SHE DID.
Jon: NOW WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO SAY FOR HERSELF?
WELL, I MISSED IT. I WAS GETTING READY FOR THIS.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
YES.
Jon: SO SHE, YOU WEREN'T -- DID SHE TAKE ATTENDANCE?
NOT THAT I KNOW OF, NO. BUT I JUST SENT MORE MONEY TO THE DCCC, SO THEY SHOULD BE OK. Jon: DID YOU REALLY SEND -- YOU HAD TO SEND MORE?
I DID. I DID. Jon: WHAT ARE THEY LIKE LOAN SHARKS THERE?
WELL,  YOU KNOW, WE HAVE, ESPECIALLY AS IT GETS CLOSER TO THE ELECTION THEY START ASKING MEMBERS FOR MORE AND MORE MONEY, AND SO I THINK I HAVE GIVEN OVER $200,000 TO THE DCCC.
Jon: WHAT?
YEAH. AND THEN A BUNCH OF MONEY TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATS IN TEXAS, TO BATTLEGROUND TEXAS, TO WENDY DAVIS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE'RE TRYING TO TURN TEXAS AROUND.
Jon: SURE, SURE. NOW, I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION DEMOCRATS DIDN'T -- [LAUGHING] I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT I AM PRETTY SURE A BULL JUST DIED. SO, HOW DO THEY RECONCILE, I KNOW THE DEMOCRATS THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT WE WANT TO GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. WE WANT TO GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS. BUT THEY SEEM TO BE SO FOCUSED ON GETTING MONEY THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET IT OUT OF POLITICS.
YEAH, YOU KNOW, AFTER CITIZENS UNITED AND THE SUPREME COURT DECISION, I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. MONEY HAS BECOME A MUCH BIGGER PART OF POLITICS.
RIGHT.
AND THERE IS A BIG DEBATE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH DO YOU RELY ON SUPER PACS. DO YOU TAKE UNLIMITED CONTRIBUTIONS OR NOT. BUT NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. I MEAN, IT'S A COMPETITION NOW IN LARGE MEASURE, OF BIG SUPER PACS.
Jon: HOW MUCH OF YOUR DAY WOULD YOU SAY, OR MAYBE EVEN YOUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES OR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IS SPENT ON THE PURSUIT OF CASH ON A TYPICAL DAY WOULD YOU SAY? >>RIGHT. IT DEPENDS IF SOMEBODY'S IN A COMPETITIVE DISTRICT OR NOT. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS NOVEMBER I ONLY HAVE A LIBERTARIAN OPPONENT. MY DISTRICT IS DEMOCRATIC SO -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SO I, YOU KNOW, BUT IF THEY'RE IN COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS. SOME FRIENDS WHO ARE IN COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS THEY'RE ON THE PHONE, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE ALL DAY. IF WE'RE NOT ON THE FLOOR VOTING.
Jon: RIGHT.
IF THEY'RE NOT IN COMMITTEE THEY'RE ON THE PHONE CALLING.
Jon: BUT DOESN'T THAT, SO, SO HAS CAMPAIGNING OVERTAKEN GOVERNANCE AS OUR CONGRESSIONAL BAILWICK? IS THE GENERAL EXPERTISE OF CONGRESS NOW OR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OR ANY BRANCH MOVED AWAY FROM GOVERNANCE AND MORE TOWARDS LIKE A REELECTION MACHINE.
WELL, IT SEEMS THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW, JON, WE'RE ONLY IN SESSION ABOUT 98 DAYS THIS IS YEAR. NOW THIS WILL BE, IF NOT THE LEAST --
Jon: 98 DAYS.
98 DAYS OUT OF THE 365, YEAH. [ AUDIENCE REACTS ] IT'S VERY SMALL.
Jon: WELL, I CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE WANT THAT JOB. [ LAUGHTER ]
YEAH WELL, WE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE CONGRESS IS ON A 7 WEEK RECESS.
Jon: RIGHT. NO -- I --  LISTEN THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT, AND HE SAID -- ARE WE RUNNING OUT OF TIME? OH FOR GOD'S SAKES! WILL YOU STICK AROUND? BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT AND SAID WE ARE IN AN EXISTENTIAL FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES WITH ISIS IN SYRIA. WE NEED TO FIGHT THESE GUYS WITHIN AN INCH OF OUR LIVES, AND BUT NOBODY CAME BACK TO WASHINGTON TO LIKE VOTE ON IT OR TALK ABOUT IT. AND THE PRESIDENT WAS LIKE, I WILL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. LIKE THEN IT WAS -- IT SEEMS THINGS HAVE GOTTEN REALLY CRAZY.
YEAH.
Jon: TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S BEEN TOUGH. THE EBOLA SITUATION CAME UP. THE ISIS SITUATION. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN WASHINGTON WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.
Jon: OH MY GOD. ALL RIGHT. SO WE WILL COME BACK. CONGRESSMAN JOAQUIN CASTRO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BCK AFTER THIS.
