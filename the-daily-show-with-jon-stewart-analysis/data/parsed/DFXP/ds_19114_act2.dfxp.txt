WELCOME BACK! NOW, AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM, THE N.R.A. BRIEFLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE CONCEPT OF BRING YOUR OWN GUN TO SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK DAY, NOT BECAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS BUT BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS BAD MANNERS, A BREACH OF OPEN CARRY DECORUM, IF YOU WILL. IMPOLITE. WELL, WE WANT TO HELP HERE. SO, HERE ARE MICHAEL CHE AND JORDAN KLEPPER WITH SECOND AMENDMENT DOS AND DON'TS.
HI THERE, NOW WHEN YOU BRING YOUR GUN TO A RESTAURANT, DO CALMLY INFORM THE OTHER PATRONS THAT YOU ARE THERE JUST TO EAT AND NOT TO SHOOT ANYONE.
AND WHEN YOU BRING YOUR GUN TO A RESTAURANT, DON'T BE BLACK! BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SHOOT, THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BELIEVE YOU. (LAUGHTER)
WHEN TRYING TO GET YOUR WAITRESS' ATTENTION, REMEMBER, DON'T SHOOT INTO THE CEILING, JUST POINT AT THE CEILING, GENTLY WAVE IT IN A CIRCULAR MOTION AND, REMEMBER, TURN ON YOUR LASER SIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW SHE'LL SEE YOU.
DON'T CARRY A GUN IF YOU'RE BLACK, OKAY? OR ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A GUN. DON'T EVEN CARRY GUM! IT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE GUN!
DO BE A GENTLEMAN, HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOR A LADY WITH THE MUZZLE OF YOUR AR-15. NOT THE BUTT, OK? JUST REMEMBER THE RHYME, DON'T BE A NUT, IT'S MUZZLE NOT BUTT.
AND REMEMBER THIS RHYME, IF YOU'RE BLACK, DON'T TRY ANY OF THIS (BLEEP). ALRIGHT? THIS IS FOR WHITE PEOPLE.
DO KEEP SEVERAL COPIES OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS IN YOUR POCKET TO PASS AROUND TO ANGRY MOTHERS AND TERRIFIED BUS BOYS.
WOAH, WOAH, WOAH. DON'T REACH IN YOUR POCKETS FOR ANYTHING! ALRIGHT? KEEP YOUR HANDS VISIBLE AT ALL TIMES, GET ONE TO HAVE THE WRIST WALLETS IF YOU HAVE TO.
IF THE MANAGER ASKS YOU TO LEAVE, DO SO POLITELY AND LEAVE AT LEAST A 10% TIP ON THE TABLE ALONG WITH YOUR MENACING NOTE.
BLACK PEOPLE, DON'T EVEN GO OUT, MAKE IT A DIGIORNO NIGHT!
IF APPROACHED BY A POLICE OFFICER, DO SHOW HIM YOUR PERMIT AND INVITE HIM TO YOUR PLACE FOR BEERS AND TARGET PRACTICE.
DON'T SAY (BLEEP) TO THE POLICE! ALRIGHT? THEY WILL USE THAT (BLEEP) AGAINST YOU! JUST GET ON THE GROUND AND CUFF YOURSELF! DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT DRAWS ATTENTION! I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'VE GOT ME IN THIS HOODY! I'LL TAKE THIS OFF.
IT'S A HOODIE, IT'S A HOODIE!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE TED TALK TALKING ABOUT MACKLEMORE?
YOU KNOW, I LOVED THAT. THE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT RYAN LEWIS?
WASN'T THAT GOOD? HEY, DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE PARANOID WHITE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE, ALL RIGHT? WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS THIS MATTER OVER BRUNCH?
OH! I LOVE BRUNCH! IT'S MY FAVORITE MEAL PORTMANTEAU!
"DON'T" ACTUALLY GO TO THAT BRUNCH. 17 THE FOR TWO POACHED EGGS? NOW THAT'S A CRIME!
Jon: ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MICHAEL AND JORDAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
