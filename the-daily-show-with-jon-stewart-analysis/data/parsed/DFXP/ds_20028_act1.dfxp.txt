FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME'S JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING" INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE EDDIE REDMAYNE IS GONNA BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, AS YOU MAY REMEMBER DEMOCRATS TOOK A BIT OF A BALL SMASHING. [LAUGHTER] IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION BUT ONE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR STILL HAS A CHANCE.
IN LOUISIANA DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU IS FACING A DECEMBER RUNOFF ELECTION AGAINST REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER BILL CASSIDY.
HER OPPONENTS POLL SHOW HIM UP BY 16 POINTS AND ANOTHER POLL SHOWED HIM UP BY ABOUT 20.
Jon:  SO, HE'S UP BY 20 POINTS. SENATOR LANDRIEU FACES A RUNOFF ELECTION WITH BILL CASSIDY IN MUCH THE SAME WAY A SKIER MIGHT FACE A RUNOFF ELECTION WITH AN AVALANCHE. BUT THE RACE ISN'T OVER YET! THERE'S STILL TIME FOR ONE LAST HAIL MARY LANDRIEU.
THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN SIX YEARS IN THE MAKING BUT THE TIMING OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE VOTES WERE POLITICS PURE AND SIMPLE. THE HOUSE WILL BASS INTRODUCED BY LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN BILL CASSIDY. THE SENATE BILL BY LOUISIANA DEMOCRAT MARY LANDRIEU.
Jon:  OH MY GOD, THAT'S SO EMBARRASSING. THEY BOTH WORE THE SAME TRANSPARENT PLOY TO CONGRESS. THAT'S JUST A SHAME. BUT YOU KNOW THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE'S LONG BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL BUGABOO. YOU CAN NEVER PASS THE DEMOCRATICALLY HELD SENATE, UNLESS THEY WERE WILLING TO SELL OUT A CORE CONSTITUENCY AND VOTE FOR THIS KEYSTONE PIPELINE BILL JUST TO SAVE ONE SENATE SEAT THAT DOESN'T EVEN CHANGE THE BALANCE OF POWER.
TO BOOST LANDRIEU'S CHANCES AT THE POLLS SOME OF HER FELLOW DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  BUT I JUST SAID THAT WOULD BE A STUPID THING TO DO. [LAUGHTER] SO THE PARTY THAT LOST THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS BECAUSE IT DIDN'T STAND FOR ANYTHING, HAS DECIDED OH I'VE GOT AN IDEA! WHAT IF WE STOOD FOR LESS? [LAUGHTER] OR MAYBE THE RIGHT TO DROP THEIR OBJECTIONS. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE?
THE PIPELINE WOULD SEND TAR SANDS OIL FROM ALBERTA, CANADA TO NEBRASKA WHERE IT WOULD HOOK UP WITH EXISTING PIPELINE TO GO TO REFINERIES ON THE GULF COAST. IT WOULD CARRY MORE THAN 800,000 BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL A DAY.
Jon:  BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE OLD METHOD OF SIMPLY OVERNIGHTING OIL WASN'T WORKING OUT VERY WELL. [LAUGHTER] ANY PROJECT THIS LARGE AND CONTROVERSIAL IS BOUND TO BE COMPLICATED. SO I THINK BEFORE WE ALL MAKE UP OUR MINDS, I THINK WE SHOULD HEAR THE PROS AND CONS. HOW MANY JOBS WOULD THIS PROJECT CREATE?
WE CAN BILL THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE CREATING THOUSANDS OF TEMPORARY AND MILLIONS OF PERMANENT JOBS,
THE CEO WHO RUNS THE PIPELINE SAYS THERE WILL BE 35 PERMANENT JOBS.
Jon:  OKAY. [LAUGHTER] SOMEWHERE BETWEEN... [LAUGHTER] ... MILLIONS OF JOBS AND 35. [LAUGHTER] SO, LET'S JUST SAY THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE WILL CREATE SOME JOBS WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF ... [LAUGHTER] ... ALMOST ALL NUMBERS.  [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING COULD CREATE JOBS DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU COULD HIRE AT LEAST A HUNDRED PEOPLE TO CHISEL DICKS ON MOUNT RUSHMORE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD DO IT. OF COURSE -- [APPLAUSE] HAVE YOU BEEN THERE? HAVE YOU BEEN TO MOUNT RUSHMORE? HAVE YOU SEEN THAT? IT'S A BIG TOURIST ATTRACTION. AND BY THE WAY, BY SAYING THIS I MEAN NO DISRESPECT TO THE BOLD MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK LONG HOURS AT HIGH ALTITUDES IN DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT OF ENGINEERING. MAY HISTORY NEVER FORGET THOSE THAT IT KNOWS ONLY AS THE CHISEL DICKS. THEIR FASCINATING STORY IS ALL IN MY NEW BOOK "CHISEL DICKS: THE STORY OF DRAWING DICKS ON MOUNT RUSHMORE." SOON TO BE A DOCUMENTARY FILM BY KEITH BURNS. NO RELATIONSHIP. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS PIPELINE.
KEYSTONE TAR SANDS PIPELINE WILL BE HARMFUL TO OUR FAMILY'S HEALTH. IT WILL HURT THE ENVIRONMENT.
PRESIDENT'S OWN STATE DEPARTMENT HAD FOUND THE PIPELINE POSES NO MEANINGFUL RISK TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
THIS GIVES US A CHANCE TO BE MORE SECURE AS A NATION AND MORE INDEPENDENT FROM FOREIGN OIL.
IT DOES NOTHING FOR AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY.
Jon: GREAT! SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS EITHER A 1200 MILE LONG JOB CREATING SLIP AND SLIDE MADE ON OF OUT OF RAINBOWS AND CHILDREN'S DREAMS. OR THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER-SIZED POISON LADEN URETHRA OF SATAN HIMSELF. THE TWO ARGUMENTS COULD NOT BE FURTHER APART, YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE TRUTH IS PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. I MEAN, ODDS ARE THIS WILL CREATE JOBS AND HAVE SOME SPILLS. WHAT'S ONE SPILL HERE AND THERE?
ONE SPILL INTO OUR AQUIFERS, YOU KNOW, IT CAN SPREAD MILES. IF OUR WATER IS CONTAMINATED WE HAVE NO WATER FOR THE CATTLE.
Jon: WELL THAT'S THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE STILL USING THEM WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE THOSE WATER BASE COWS. YOUR PROBLEM THERE IS YOU GOT TO UPGRADE TO WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, THE OIL BURNING COWS. GOT THEM OIL BURNING COWS. THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. PROBLEM SOLVED. YOU JUST GOT TO GET THOSE COWS WITH THE TWO SMOKE -- DID YOU EVER SEE THOSE WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING? SO SENATORS FROM BOTH PARTIES BATTLED FOR HOURS TO SWAY THE PIPELINE VOTES AND APARENTLY ALSO TO SEE IF THEY COULD MAKE THE SENATE'S GIANT PRINTER RUN OUT OF TONER AND INK. YOU KNOW, THE SADDEST THING ABOUT THAT RIGHT THERE ISN'T THE PICTURE OF POLLUTED SKIES, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT PICTURE, IT'S THAT SENATOR BOXER MADE THAT AIDE HOLD THAT GIANT PHOTO AS THOUGH HE WERE A HUMAN EASEL. WHEN THERE IS VERY CLEARLY A REGULAR NON-HUMAN EASEL JUST TWO ROWS BACK. IT IS UPSETTING. BUT I GUESS THAT'S A WIN FOR THE REPUBLICANS. PIPELINE NOT EVEN BUILT YET, ALREADY CREATED A JOB. BUT HERE WE GO. IT'S MARY LANDRIEU THAT'S GOT THE MOST AT STAKE HERE, SO ASIDE FROM THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO LIVE ON ENORMOUS PIPELINE AVENUE, I'M SURE SHE'S GOT THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT. LET'S LISTEN.
WE'VE BEEN BUILDING PIPELINES IN THIS COUNTRY BEFORE MOST OF US WERE BORN. ALL OF US WERE BORN. THAT'S WHAT'S SO OUTRAGEOUS ABOUT THIS DEBATE.
AND I SAY TO YOU TONIGHT MY FELLOW AMERICANS WE NEED TO RETURN TO DOING THINGS THE WAY THAT THEY WERE BEFORE WE WERE ALL BORN. LIKE SLAVERY. BRING THAT BACK. WHAT AM I EVEN DOING  STANDING HERE VOTING LIKE I WAS A MAN OR SOMETHING. WE HAVE LAWS. OUR WAY. RETURN TO HOW THINGS WERE WHEN WE WERE NOT BORN. [LAUGHTER] SO WE'VE ALWAYS BUILT PIPELINES, WHY STOP NOW IS THE MOST CONVINCING LINE OF REASONING. WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT?
WHAT PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA WANT, WHAT PEOPLE IN TEXAS WANT, WHAT PEOPLE IN MISSISSIPPI WANT, WHAT PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY WANT, WHAT PEOPLE IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND ILLINOIS AND KANSAS AND VERMONT, ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS.
Jon:  ARE YOU GOING TO NAME THEM ALL? ARE YOU GOING TO NAME ALL THE STATES? BECAUSE ARE THERE STATES THAT DON'T WANT GOOD PAYING JOBS? [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE VALID  IN OREGON. THEY JUST BAG GROCERIES AND ENTER DATA FOR THE RUSH. ALRIGHT SO LANDRIEU'S LEGISLATIVE LIFE IS ON THE LINE. BASES LOADED. BOTTOM OF THE NINTH. AND THE PITCH.
THE BILL FAILED BY ONE VOTE.
Jon: SO CLOSE! IT'S LIKE MY DAD ALWAYS SAID YOU'RE JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH. [LAUGHTER]  YEAH. SO THAT'S IT. LANDRIEU'S ALMOST CERTAINLY GONE. THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE'S BEEN VOTED DOWN NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.
REPUBLICANS TAKE OVER THE CONGRESS, THE SENATE IN JANUARY. THEY WILL BRING THIS UP FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS AND IT WILL PASS.
Jon: AND WHEN IT DOES SOMEWHERE, EX-SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU WILL BE THANKFUL THAT EVEN THOUGH THE PIPELINE DIDN'T SAVE HER JOB, SHE CAN NOW APPLY FOR ONE OF ITS 35 TO MILLIONS OF NEW ONES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [APPLAUSE]  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
