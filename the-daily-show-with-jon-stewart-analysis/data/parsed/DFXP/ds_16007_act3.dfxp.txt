Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT. ♪ ♪  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: THE SNOW STORM MAKE YOU FEEL AT HOME?
FEEL RIGHT AT HOME. I GOT THAT SNOW SHOVELING JOKE EARLIER. IT WAS GOOD.
Jon: I'M QUITE CLEVER. THE BOOK IS CALLED COURAGE TO STAND, AN AMERICAN STORY. I WANT TO OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW THE TRAGIC EVENTS IN ARIZONA WEIGH HEAVILY ON EVERYBODY'S MIND. BEFORE OUR CONVERSATION I WANT TO MOVE PAST THE IDEA THAT OUR POLITICAL RHETORIC AND THE  CONTEXT OF NEWS SOMEHOW IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. BUT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR POLITICAL RHETORIC AND THE CONTENT OF NEWS. REMOVING THAT FROM IT.
WITHOUT THE CONTEXT OF THAT IF WE COULD. BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE, TO ME,, YOU KNOW, BRAC -- BARACK OBAMA'S CRITICS ARE||| REACTING TO AS THOUGH HE IS SOMETHING THIS  COUNTRY HASN'T SEEN BEFORE. A PROMINENT REPUBLICAN TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN OUR SOCIETY. A MARCH TO TYRANNY. YOU KNOW, THE LANGUAGE IS AS THOUGH WE'RE SLIPPING INTO SOMETHING. I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU AGREE THAT THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. IF THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. DOES THE RHETORIC MATCH THE REALITY AND HOW MUCH OF IT -- FORGETTING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES  TO ALL THAT STUFF -- I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I'M ASKING YOU, DOES THAT MATCH WHAT YOU THINK IS HAPPENING?
I APPRECIATE YOU FRAMED IT UP THAT WAY. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE.
Jon: NO, NO NEW YORK CITY. >>ING -- NO NO NO.
IF YOU SAY YOU CAN SAY THIS OR NOT THAT AND YOU CAN USE THIS TONE OR THAT TONE. PRETTY SOON YOU DISCOURAGE, CHILL, INTIMIDATE. I CAUGHT MYSELF TODAY TALKING ABOUT HOCKEY FIGHT AND PUBLIC POLICY AND MAYBE I SHOULDN'T  BRING THAT UP NOW BECAUSE OF THIS CONCERN. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL FROM A --
Jon: I DON'T MEAN IT FROM A FREE SPEECH STANDPOINT. I MEAN IT FROM A REALITY STANDPOINT. [LAUGHTER] HONESTLY --
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE THEY CONNECTED.
Jon: ARE THEY? MY QUESTION IS THE REALITY OF WHAT IS DISCUSSED ON THOSE THINGS IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF  YOU NEED TO TONE THAT DOWN BECAUSE YOU WILL UNHINGE PEOPLE, MY QUESTION IS MORE:  IS THAT REALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING? IS THE RHETORIC OF THE PARTY MATCHING? HERE IS WHY:  THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT  THAN EIGHT YEARS UNDER GEORGE BUSH. BUT THE PANIC AND THE REACTION THAT IT HAS SET OFF DOES SEEM FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT TO SOME EXTENT.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE BUSH ERA THERE WAS A LOT OF HAVE IT -- VITROL AND ANGER TOWARDS  PRESIDENT BUSH. IS IT WORSE? A DIFFERENT LEVEL?
Jon: YES, YES. I WOULD SAY THERE'S A POLITICAL MOVEMENT BASED UPON THAT THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS BASED ON A  REVOLUTION FETISH, TO SOME EXTENT.
LET ME PUT IT IS THIS WAY JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN AND DO AND SAY  SOMETHING, DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD. WE'VE GOT RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. EXERCISE THEM RESPONSIBLY. BE FAIR AND ACCURATE. I SAID THINGS AND I GO HOME AT NIGHT AND SAY I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT THAT WAY. WE HAVE TO DO IT RESPONSIBLY. INFORMED CITIZENRY IS THE KEY TO DEMOCRACY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACCURATE GOOD INFORMATION. WE HAVE RIGHT AND LEFT, A LOT OF VITRIOL BOTH WAYS. ALL OF US COULD BENEFIT FROM A MORE INFORMED DEBATE.
Jon: THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
WHEN YOU WERE THROWING THE F- EN HIRAMER AROUND HERE I THOUGHT THAT -- FINHEIMER LRN.
Jon: THE F-INHKS EIMER. IT'S NOT WHETHER WE SHOULD BE DIVIDE IN THOSE CAMPS MY POINT IS THIS. WHY IS THE RIGHT SO FEARFUL TYRANNY NOW WHEN GEORGE BUSH EXPANDED EXECUTIVE POWER TO GREATLY. NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND HONESTLY PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCES NO CHILD  LEFT BEHIND. AN ENORMOUS FEDERAL MANDATE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. YOU SUPPORTED IT UNDER BUSH. WOULD YOU DISAGREE WITH ME THAT IF BARACK OBAMA SUGGESTED THAT THERE WOULD BE GLENN BECK WOULD  HAVE PICTURES OF STALIN BEHIND HIM, GIANT. HE WOULD BE LEANING IN AND SAYING WE HAVE BROUGHT UPON US A TRAGEDY -- THEY WANT OUR CHILDREN! [LAUGHTER] I GUESS MY POINT IS --  [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. ISN'T IT A CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO WHIP UP A VOTING BLOCK OR DO PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S  BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN OUR GOVERNMENT TOWARDS TYRANNY AND SOCIALISM?
I'LL ANSWER THAT. LET ME STEP BACK. I'M THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHERE THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION WAS IN 2008. YOU ALMOST HAD TO PUT --
Jon: I WAS THERE.
WE HAD TO PUT A MILITARY ZONE BECAUSE PROTESTERS, MOSTLY ON  THE LEFT WERE YELLING, SCREAMING EXCRETING A SECURITY AND PHYSICAL THREAT TO THE CONVENTION. THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.
Jon: IF THE DEFENSE IS THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO DO IT TOO  THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A DEFENSE. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN CONFLATE 18-YEAR-OLDS WHO HAVE WRITTEN A NAME ON THEIR ARM WITH NEWT  GINGRICH WORK RUSH LIMBAUGH AND LEADERS OF REPUBLICAN PARTY. THAT'S A COP OUT. WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS FUNDAMENTALLY DOES THE REMEMBER PARTY BELIEVE -- REPUBLICAN  PARTY BELIEVE WE ARE AS CLOSE TO TYRANNY AND SOCIALISM AS THE TONE OF THEIR RHETORIC WOULD  INSIN YIEWATE?
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF US IN THE MOVEMENT THAT VIEW GOVERNMENT AS CROWDS INTO MORE  SPACE THAT USED TO BE INDIVIDUALS, THAT USED TO BE FOR PRIVATE MARKETS, THAT USED TO BE  CHARITY AND ENTREPRENEUR ACTIVITIES, THAT USED TO BE FOR FAITH ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY  PUSH IN AND SAY WE'LL DO THAT NOW. THEY TAKE OVER ONE MORE PIECE OF WHAT USED TO BE RESERVED FOR INDIVIDUALS. THERE'S A LOT OF US WHO SAY THAT FEELS KIND OF LIKE GOVERNMENT STEPPING ON US, PUSHING US TO  THE SIDE. THERE'S A CONTINUUM BETWEEN LIBERTY AND TYRANNY. IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS SLOWLY. IS IT ABOUT THROWING STONES AND TAKEN OVER BY FORCE? MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE GETS NUDGED OUT OF THE WAY. YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A CONTINUUM. IN MY VIEW --
Jon: I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A CONTINUUM I BELIEVE IT'S A PENDULUM. IT TENDS TO MOVE BACK AND FORTH AT TIMES. I PROBABLY FEEL THE COUNTRY IS MORE STABLE THAN WHAT I'M SEEING FROM THE RHETORIC. THE POINT THAT IS YET TO BE ADDRESSED IS WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION TRIGGERED THIS  IMMUNE RESPONSE AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T WHEN THEY WERE DOING VERY SIMILAR THINGS. THE MEDICARE ACT, NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND, NATIONAL I.D. THERE WAS A HUGE INCREASE IN FEDERAL PRECEDENCE THAT DIDN'T CAUSE THIS EVEN THEY ARE CREEING IN.
I GUESS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WHETHER IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT. YOU PLAY THE TAPES IN THE PEAK OR THE LOW POINT DEPENDING ON YOUR PER INSPECTY OF BUSH YEARS. SEE THE ANGER AND GO ON OTHER TV STATIONS AND SEE THEY ARE DIFFERENT. BEYOND ALL AFTER THIS -- WHAT DRIVES ANGER? WHAT DRIVES ANGER FROM THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT? I THINK PART OF IS FEAR. YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF? YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF MOSTLY IN THIS COUNTRY? THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR JOBS. THEY CAN'T GET THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE. THEY CAN'T PAY FOR HEALTH CARE AND THEY ARE TICKED OFF. THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS YOU ACT ON IT.
Jon: ARE WE PLAYING TO REAL FEAR OR ARE WE INVENTING FEARS  TO CREATE THAT DON'T ACTUALLY ADDRESS WHAT PEOPLE ARE LEGITIMATELY AFRAID OF? THERE'S A DISTINCTION. ARE WE DEALING WITH WHAT IS REAL OR WHAT IS EXPEDIENT?
FOR THOSE PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED, UNDEREMPLOYED, CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS, GETTING FORECLOSUREED  ON -- FORECLOSED ON, CAN'T PAY HEALTH CARE IT'S REAL.
Jon: THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TYRANNY AND MORE TO DO WITH  WE SHOULD USE EVERY TOOL IN OUR TOOL BOX SHOULD WE NOT. IF RAISING TAXES COULD DO ONE THING, CUTTING ONE PROGRAM COULD DO SOMETHING BUT ADDING ANOTHER. IT FEELS LIKE AN IDEA LOGICAL VACUUM. WE'RE OVER. I DON'T WANT TO CREW -- SCREW UP THE GUYS HERE. I'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL. "COURAGE TO STAND" SON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
