JULY 28th, 2011,FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART, MAN! DO WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST PETER TOMSEN, AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK "THE WARS OF AFGHANISTAN" THAT'S RIGHT, PLURAL, WARS. AS YOU KNOW, DEBT CEILING DISCUSSIONS, COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE. POLITICAL LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS. ALL THE STOPS. LIKE THE KIND OF STOPS THAT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACHES USE BEFORE HOMECOMING GAMES  IN PARTICULAR AT THISCIOUS SMALL TOWNS.
KEVIN McCARTHY A THIRD RANKING REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE URGED REPUBLICANS TO  UNITE BEHIND BOEHNER'S PLAN BY SHOWING THIS CLIP FROM THE MOVIE "THE TOWN"
THE TOWN? (LAUGHTER) "THE TOWN", NO RUDY-- "RUDY"  "BRIAN SONG" OR "300" OR "ROCKY" OR "ROCKY 2" OR  "ROCKY 3" OR REALLY ANY OF THE "ROCKIES" YOU WENT WITH  THE BOSTON BANK RUBBERS IN NUN COSTUMES CLIP.
WELL, THERE IS GOING TO BE GOOD. (LAUGHTER) LET'S SEE THE CLIP--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT THE REPUBLICANS USED, LET'S SEE THE CLIP THAT THE REPUBLICANS USED TO URGE THEIR HARD LINE TEA PARTY  FRESHMAN COALITION TO DROP THEIR OBJECTIONS TO JOHN BOEHNER'S DEBT CEILING PLAN  AND VOTE WITH THEIR MORE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN BRETHREN.
I NEED YOUR HELP. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. YOU CAN NEVER ASK ME ABOUT IT LATER. AND WE'RE GOING TO HURT SOME PEOPLE.
WHICH CAR ARE WE GOING TO TAKE? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND THIS METAPHOR. THE ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING TO THE TEA PARTY UPSTARTS HEY, YOU KNOW THE VIOLENT, UNSTABLE BORDERLINE SOCIO PATH FROM "THE TOWN" WHO'S USEFUL IN A PINCH BUT  WHOSE SUICIDAL SINGLE MINDED MANIA WILL ULTIMATELY BE HIS DOWNFALL? THAT'S YOU GUYS. (LAUGHTER) AND THE GUY WHO IS STUCK IN AN UNEASY ALLIANCE WITH YOU BUT DOESN'T REALLY LIKE YOU  AND ULTIMATELY SAVES HIMSELF BY WALKING AWAY FROM YOU AS YOU ARE DYING, THAT'S US. (LAUGHTER) SO DO WE HAVE YOUR VOTE? (LAUGHTER) I'M GOING TO ASSUME MOST OF THE TEA PARTY COALITION HAS NOT SEEN THE WHOLE MOVIE.
ALLEN WEST LIKED WHAT HE HEARD.
SO I GOT UP AND TOLD THE SPEAKER I WILL DRIVE THE CAR. (LAUGHTER) QUICK, ROBIN, TO THE BAT  [BLEEP] MOBILE. STILL, IF NOTHING ELSE, THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TO THE REPUBLICAN'S USE OF THAT  CLIP FROM THE MOVIE "THE TOWN" DID LEAD TO ONE OF MY FAVORITE RECENT MOMENTS IN  CABLE NEWS. I GIVE YOU CHUCK SCHUMER MASCHUGANA MOVIE BREAKDOWN.
IN THE SCENE THEY INSPIRE THEIR HOUSE FRESHMAN, ONE OF THE CROOKS GIVES A PEP TALK  TO THE OTHER, RIGHT BEFORE THEY BOTH PUT ON HOCKEY MASKS, BLUDGEON TWO MEN WITH  STICKS, AND SHOOT A MAN IN THE LEG. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL TALKING IN A RIDICULOUS BOSTON ACCENT. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JOIN US NEXT WEEK WHEN I, CHUCK SCHUMER, REVIEW THE SCI-FI CLASSIC "THE STAR WARS"
AN ASTHMATIC MAN DRESSED IN BLACK PLASTIC CUTS THE ARM OFF OF THE BOY WEARING  PAJAMAS WITH SOME TYPE OF A GLOW STICK. (LAUGHTER) AND HERE'S THE PART YOU WON'T BELIEVE. THE MAN IN THE SUIT IS THE BOY'S FATHER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT MUST BE THE WORST DVD FEATURE EXTRA EVER. NOW WITH THE STANDOFF IN OUR NATION'S CAPITOL OVER THE DEBT CEILING SHOWING US  NOTHING BUT BITTER STALEMATE, IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT IT WAS JUST ONE YEAR AGO THAT WASHINGTON ACTUALLY GOT  SOMETHING DONE, THE DODD FRANK ACT, A COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING OUR FINANCIAL  SYSTEM INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT WE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SUFFER ANOTHER 2008-STYLE MELTDOWN.
THESE REFORMS REPRESENT THE STRONGEST CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTIONS IN HISTORY. AND THESE PROTECTIONS WILL BE ENFORCED BY A NEW CONSUMER WATCHDOG WITH JUST  ONE JOB, LOOKING OUT FOR PEOPLE, NOT BIG BANKS, NOT LENDERS, NOT INVESTMENT HOUSES, LOOKING OUT FOR  PEOPLE-- .
Jon: WHAT, WAIT, WHO? WHO ARE WE LOOKING OUT FOR BEFORE? (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, THE DODD FRANK ACT IS NOW ONE YEAR OLD. AND HERE TO DISCUSS THE EFFECT IT'S HAVING IN REFORMING A DAMAGED  FINANCIAL SYSTEM, WE'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE WITH US TONIGHT, HR 4127-- 4173. THE DODD FRANK ACT, EVERYBODY.

AND YOU KNOW WHAT, EXACTLY, BOO, EXACTLY.
BOO!
THANK YOU, BOYS AND GIRLS, THANK YOU. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT, IF ANY ACTUAL TOUGH RULE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE THROUGH, CONGRESS  PEOPLE CUT THE BUDGET OF THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING IT.
