(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME BACK! NOW, AS THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE SHOWN, THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IS A LONG AND DIFFICULT JOURNEY. HAPPILY, THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES WILL BE MUCH EASIER THAN THAT AS JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
THE AMERICAN SOUTH HAS COME A LONG WAY SINCE THE '60s BUT NOW IN WINSTON-SALEM, ONE BUSINESS HAS FOUND A NEW MINORITY TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST. ATHEISTS.
A RESTAURANT IN NORTH CAROLINA IS GIVING CUSTOMERS A NICE DISCOUNT IF THEY DO ONE THING: PRAY BEFORE YOU EAT. >>THAT'S RIGHT. MARY'S GOURMET DINER WAS GIVING A 15% DISCOUNT FOR BELIEVERS WHICH ACCORDING TO OUTSPOKEN ATHEIST DAN BARKER IS A VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS.
MARY'S GOURMET DINER IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. UNDER THE LAW SELMA AND A 15% DISCOUNT ARE THE SAME THING.
SELMA, BIRMINGHAM, MARY'S GOURMET DINER?
YEAH, IN ONE CASE IT WAS RACE OR SKIN COLOR AND ANOTHER CASE IT'S RELIGION.
EXACTLY. SO, I WENT TO STARE STRAIGHT INTO THE FACE OF HATE, ALSO KNOWN AS DINER OWNER MARY HAGLUND.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SET OUT TO DO WAS TO MAKE EVERYONE FEEL WELCOME. WE JUST FELT THAT IT WAS AN ACT OF REWARDING PEOPLE FOR BEING GRATEFUL. WE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS DISCRIMINATORY AT ALL.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A BIGOT?
I'M NOT A BIGOT. >>BUT YOU WOULDN'T SERVE THE PEOPLE FROM THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION ORGANIZATION?
I'VE NEVER MET THEM.
CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T EVEN TALK TO THEM WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE DINER?
OH, I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE TALKED TO THEM. BUT THEY NEVER SHOWED UP.
BULL (BLEEP). MARTIN LUTHER KING WENT TO SELMA AND DAN BARKER DEFINITELY WENT TO MARY'S.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE FROM FREEDOM OF RELIGION WENT TO MARY'S.
YOU DIDN'T GO DOWN THERE? ACTUALLY, IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.
ON THE INTERNET.
ON THE INTERNET, YES.
YOU'RE TROLLING THE INTERNET.
SOME PEOPLE ARE TROLLING THE INTERNET, WE ARE NOT.
Jon: OKAY, BUT THERE WERE ACTUAL ATHEISTS WHO ATE AT MARY'S AND THEY WERE DEHUMANIZED.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'VE GOTTEN THE DISCOUNT.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO DO THAT? YOU BROKE YOUR CORE BELIEFS AND YOU BELIEVED IN GOD?
NO, I JUST SAID THANK YOU TO THE CHEF.
I GET OTHER DISCOUNTS. I GET ONE TO THE SYMPHONY FOR BEING A SUBSCRIBER.
WHY ALL THE HULLABALOO?
I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST BEING DICKS.
YOU'RE NOT JUST BEING A DICK, ARE YOU?
THAT'S LIKE WHEN DID YOU STOP BEATING YOUR WIFE.
WHAT? DID YOU -- DID YOU -- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME RIGHT NOW?
YOUR QUESTION WAS YOU'RE NOT JUST BEING A DICK. AND BY ANSWERING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME I WAS AT LEAST BEING A DICK, SO I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION UNTIL IT'S PROPERLY FORMULATED.
BUT ARE YOU BEING A DICK?
IF YOU WANT TO LABEL SOMEONE WHO FIGHTS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT, A DICK, YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO THAT. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GETTING THE DISCOUNT FOR PRAYING, THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I MEAN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A PRAYER, IT CAN JUST BE A MOMENT OF QUIET INTERSPECTION.
Jon: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
IT'S A MOMENT. A BREATH.
IF I WANTED A DISCOUNT, I COULD DO THIS? (DEEP BREATH)
YES.
YOU'RE (BLEEP) ME.
NOT ANYBODY CAN GET IT. NO.
WATCH, THIS RIGHT HERE GETS YOU 15%. THIS RIGHT HERE. THAT'S ME JUST STIFLING A FART.
WELL, WE DON'T DO IT. WHAT ATHEIST WOULD PRAY TO A NON-ENTITY. NO ONE DOES THAT?
ONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PRAY FULL PRICE FOR A B.L.T.
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE A HYPOCRITE ATHEIST FOR A DISCOUNT, THAT'S FINE.
WELL, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE ATHEIST? YOU'RE GOING GO TO NOT HELL?
I HAVE TOO MUCH INTEGRITY AS A RATIONAL PERSON TO PRETEND THAT I'M TALKING TO A GHOST IN THE SKY.
YOU HAVE THAT MUCH INTEGRITY, BUT YOU WILL BITCH ABOUT 25 CENTS EXTRA FOR EGGS?
YES, BECAUSE IT'S THE PRINCIPLE OF IT.
AND DAN STUCK TO HIS PRINCIPLES BY HAVING ONE OF HIS LAWYERS ACTUALLY SEND A THREATENING LETTER TO MARY'S GOURMET DINER TELLING HER SHE WAS IN VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
LOOK, I'M AN ATHEIST. ALRIGHT, I GET IT.  WE NEED SOMEONE FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. IS THIS A GOOD FIGHT?
YOU CAN SAY THIS IS MORE UNFAIR OR LESS UNFAIR BUT IT'S STILL UNFAIR. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE GENOCIDE, SUPPOSE YOU EXTERMINATED A WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE, 20,000. THEY'RE ALL KILLED OUT. BUT SUPPOSE SOMEONE ELSE EXTERMINATED 20 MILLION PEOPLE, ONE IS SMALL BY COMPARISON BUT THE SAME CRIME.
WHY DID YOU BRING UP GENOCIDE?
IF I SAY THE WORD GENOCIDE, ARE YOU THINKING A NUMBER?
NO, I'M THINKING WEREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT MARY'S GOURMET DINER?
YEAH AND ON THE BIG PICTURE, GENOCIDE IS A BIG PICTURE. MARY'S GOURMET DINER IS A SMALL PICTURE.
BUT THAT'S MY POINT.
EXACTLY, SO WOULD YOU THINK A GREATER GENOCIDE IS WORSE THAN A SMALLER GENOCIDE?
NO, GENOCIDE IS GENOCIDE. MARY'S GOURMET DINER IS BRUNCH.
WE'RE NOT COMPARING THEM.
YET THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUST DOING.
NO WE WEREN'T. WE WERE MAKING AN ANALOGY.
WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW IS A COMPARISON. OKAY, I THINK I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.
I THINK THESE GUYS ARE JUST BEING PETTY ASSHOLES, RIGHT?
I REALLY DONT WANT TO SAY THAT.
YEAH, YOU WON'T SAY IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A NICE PERSON. BUT LET'S JUST TAKE A MOMENT OF SILENCE IF WE AGREE THAT THESE GUYS ARE PETTY ASSHOLES.
ABSOLUTELY.
AMEN. IN THE END, MAYBE WE WOULD ALL BE BETTER OFF IF DAN WOULD JUST LIGHTEN THE (BLEEP) UP.
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. NO.
EVER HEAR ABOUT THE ATHEIST, RABBI AND THE PRIEST WALK INTO A BAR?
WHICH ONE?
THE ONE WHERE THE RABBI AND PRIEST SHUT THE DOOR BEFORE THE ATHEIST CAN GET IN THE BAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH HIM BECAUSE HE'S SUCH A DICK.
THAT'S A JOKE?
NO, IT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
