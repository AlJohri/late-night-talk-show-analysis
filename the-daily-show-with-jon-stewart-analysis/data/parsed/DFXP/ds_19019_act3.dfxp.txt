Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHOR NEW BOOK CALLED FINDING THE DRAGON LADY, THE MYSTERY OF VIETNAM'S MADAM NHU. PLEASE WELCOME MONIQUE BRINSON DEMERY. HELLO! THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: I HAVE TO SAY, FINDING THE DRAGON LADY, HAS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOK COVER PICTURES OF ALL TIME. THIS IS, I'M ASSUMING, HER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION PHOTO, I DON'T-- WHAT IS THIS PHOTO THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT?
THIS IS A GREAT PHOTO. MADAME NHU HAD A WOMEN'S MILITIA IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND SHE WAS OUT INSPECTING THE TROOPS MAKING SURE THEIR JACKETS WERE FITTING RIGHT AND THEIR PANTS, BECAUSE ACTUALLY THEY WERE VERY STYLISH, THE WOMEN'S MILITIA. SO SHE WAS OUT THERE AND SORT OF SHOWING OFF HER AIM.
Jon: HER AIM FOR THE MILITIA. NOW HOW DID YOU-- SHE GOES INTO EXILE. AND HOW DID YOU THINK OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO, I SHOULD CALL HER. HOW DID THAT OCCUR TO YOU?
WELL, THE FIRST THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME WAS I NEVER SAW AN OBITUARY FOR HER, SO SHE FADED FROM VIEW BUT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE. SO JUST BECAUSE SHE WASN'T TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE, I THOUGHT WELL, I COULD TRY.
Jon: RIGHT. AND YOU STRUCK UP A CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER.
I DID. AND WE HAD PHONE CONVERSATIONS AND AT THE END SHE EVEN E-MAILED WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SORT OF COOL FOR THE DRAGON LADY.
Jon: YEAH. DID SHE, WAS THAT HER HANDLE, WAS THAT HER-- IS THERE AN EMOTICON THAT HAS A LADY WITH A GUN ON IT?
IT WAS HER KIDS INTERNET ACCOUNT THAT THEN SHE USED. BUT SHE WOULD HAVE A GREAT TWITTER NAME I'M SURE.
Jon: NOW SHE WAS NOT THE FIRST LADY OF SOUTH VIETNAM. SHE WAS MARRIED TO, I GUESS, THE PRESIDENT'S BROTHER.
RIGHT. SO WE CALL HER THE FIRST LADY BECAUSE SHE WAS THE HOSTESS, SHE WAS THE DIPLOMATIC.
Jon: HE WAS NOT MARRIED, THE PRESIDENT.
CORRECT. HE WAS NOT MARRIED. SO HE CHOSE FOR HIS FIRST LADY HIS YOUNGER BROTHER'S WIFE. AND WHO WOULDN'T CHOOSE HER. I MEAN SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL. SHE WAS VERY ELEGANT. AND SHE ACTUALLY WAS PRETTY ASTUTE.
Jon: AS A POLITICAL --
AS A POLITICIAN.
Jon: THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, SHE'S REALLY THE REASON THAT KENNEDY KIND OF BACKED THE COUP, YEAH?
YEAH. KENNEDY HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH MADAM NHU BECAUSE HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE MEN IN HER FAMILY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE BEING LED AROUND BY HER APRON STRINGS. AND SO HE JUST REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE AMERICA WAS DOING THE SAME. SO MEANWHILE HIS OWN WIFE JACKIE WAS THE PERFECT IMAGE OF A FIRST LADY. SHE WAS REFINED. SHE WAS QUIET, FOR THE MOST PART. AND MADAME NHU WAS EVERYTHING-- ACCORDING TO JACKIE, SHE WAS EVERYTHING THAT JACK FOUND UNATTRACTIVE.
Jon: RIGHT. WELL-- A LADY WITH A GUN. FOR JACK KENNEDY THAT'S A PROBLEM. BUT IN MANY RESPECTS, YOU KNOW, THAT DECISION IS WHAT SORT OF LED TO THE COMMUNISTS COMING INTO VIETNAM WHICH THEN LED TO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY ULTIMATELY THE MOVIE "FORREST GUMP" BEATING "PULP FICTION" AT THE OSCARS WHICH I THINK WE ALL AGREE WAS THE REAL TRAGEDY OF THIS ENTIRE DEBACLE. WAS SHE IN ANY WAY STILL FRIGHTENED? WAS SHE PARANOID THAT FORCES WERE GOING TO BE OUT TO GET HER?
SURE. SO BY THE TIME I FOUND HER, I HAD TO SWEAR UP AND DOWN THAT I WAS NOT A GOVERNMENT AGENT. I WAS NOT MARRIED TO A GOVERNMENT AGENT. NO ONE IN MY FAMILY BELONGED TO THE CIA. AND SHE REALLY DIDN'T TRUST ME AT FIRST. AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY. SHE HAD BEEN BURNED BEFORE. SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO EARN HER TRUST.
Jon: AND YOU HAD SET UP MANY DIFFERENT MEETINGS WITH HER. YOU WENT TO PARIS THIS YEAR. BUT SHE NEVER ACTUALLY SHOWS UP.
NO. SHE DOESN'T. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK SHE LIKES TO THINK OF HERSELF AS THIS POWERFUL, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. AND SO FOR HER TO SHOW HERSELF AS SORT OF AN OLDER WOMAN, DIMINISHED, FORGOTTEN BY EVERYBODY BUT ME, I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN A HARD EGO THING.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY. AND WAS THERE EVER A POINT IN YOUR MIND WHERE YOU THOUGHT OH, I'M BEING CATFISHED HERE. THIS IS PROBABLY THAT-- THIS IS PROBABLY THAT TOUIASOSOPO GUY THAT GOT MANTI T'EO.  I MEAN HOW DID YOU IN YOUR MIND GET THIS SO THAT YOU VERIFIED THAT IT WAS REALLY HER?
I HAD TO LISTEN A LOT OF HER CONVERSATIONS. AND THEY WOULD MEANDER. AND I WOULD GO ALONG. SOMETIMES WONDERING WHERE WE WOULD END UP. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WENT THROUGH THE ARCHIVES IN D.C. AND IN FRANCE AND I SPOKE TO A LOT OF HER COLLEAGUES, PEOPLE WHO HATED HER AT THE TIME AND WERE WRITING AGAINST HER. AND THE STORIES MATCH UP. IT WAS DEFINITELY HER THAT I WAS TALKING TO.
Jon: AND SHE ALSO HAD HER MEMOIRS THAT SHE WANTED TO GET OUT THERE.
SHE DID. SHE HAD TWO VOLUMES OF SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES, WHICH WERE REALLY PIECES OF THEM WERE REALLY ENLIGHTENING. AND THE OTHER PARTS WERE BIBLICAL, SORT OF SCRIPTURE, TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF THE UNIVERSE TYPE OF WRITING.
Jon: REALLY?
REALLY.
Jon: LIKE KIND OF DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS TEENAGER TYPE STUFF OR WHAT IF WE'RE ALL JUST MARBLES FLOATING AND AND-- THAT SORT OF PHILOSOPHY.
MORE LIKE PREDESTINED, THIS LIFE WAS CHOSEN FOR ME.
Jon: OH, REALLY.
YEAH.
Jon: SO SHE WAS FATALLISTIC ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.
MARTYRED, YEAH.
Jon: DID SHE HAVE ANY SELF-AWARENESS OF, YOU KNOW SHE WAS NOT A NICE PERSON. THE BUDDHIST MONKS WOULD IMMOLATE IN VIETNAM IN PROTEST AND SHE WOULD SAY LET THEM BURN, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS KIND OF A TERRIBLE PERSON.
THE BARBECUE COMMENT.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
SHE DID EXPRESS ONE REGRET AND THE REGRET WAS THAT SHE HADN'T BEEN MORE HUMBLE. IN OTHER WORDS, NOT THAT SHE WAS WRONG, BUT THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE ACTED A LITTLE BIT LESS LOUDLY ABOUT HER ACHIEVEMENTS.
Jon: OH MY GOD. I HAVE ONE REGRET. I DIDN'T TRY TO HIDE MY AWESOMENESS. LOVE IT A FASCINATING STORY. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, BOY, IT TAKES ONE PERSON'S CURIOSITY TO BRING TO LIFE A STORY THAT OTHERWISE I THINK WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY. AND ONE THAT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SAD IF THIS HAD NEVER COME TO LIGHT SO I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL SO THANK YOU FOR DOING IT. THE BOOK IS FINDING THE DRAGON LADY. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW.
