Jon: ACE BANDAGE THAT. SUIT UP, BOY. I WANT TO SHOW THIS BOOK. I WANT TO SHOW MAYBE MY FAVORITE AWJER PICTURE IN THE HISTORY OF AUTHOR PICTURES. CAN YOU GET IN ON THAT?
YEAH. [LAUGHTER] BOLDLY FACING THE FUTURE. [LAUGHTER] I'M LITERALLY -- THAT'S IN A CLUB IN NASHVILLE. I'M LITERALLY HIDING BEHIND THE SOFT DRINK CONTAINERS IN THE BACK IN A HALLWAY IN THE BACK  CLUTCHING A NOTEBOOK TO MY CHEST.
Jon: IT'S SO RECOMMEND NECESSARY -- REMINISCENT. WE CAME UP WORKING THE COMEDY CLUBS AND I LOOK AT THAT PICTURE AND THINK WOW, THEY HAD A NICE GREENROOM. NORMALLY IT'S LIKE YOU CAN SIT HERE DURING THE SHOW BY THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
YOU ARE SITTING WHERE THEY ARE PILING THE EMPTY MOZZARELLA STICKS BASKETS. DON'T KNOCK THESE OVER. DON'T DO THIS WITH YOUR ARMS. HEAD DUN. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE ON.
Jon: AT THE END OF THE NIGHT THEY ARE LOOK WE DON'T PAY  IN CASH BUT WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MOZZARELLA STICKS.
MOZZARELLA STICKS FOR THE ROAD, PLEASE.
Jon: WHY WRITE -- THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK FROM PATTON OSWALT. I EXPECT MANY MORE. A FERTILE MIND YOU HAVE I SOMEHOW SAY AS YODA. FERTILE MIND YOU HAVE.
HMMMM. YEAH, THIS WAS THE FIRST. WRITING A BOOK WAS -- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE THAT MUCH FUN. YOU GO TO -- YOU PITCH TO PUBLISHERS AND I WENT WITH SCRIPTNER. GREAT.
Jon: YOU CAN'T --
THE MUFFIN BASKET ALONE. THAT'S HOW THEY KEEP STEPHEN KING.
Jon: IT'S PAPER AND WORDS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OURS SMELL LIKE STRAWBERRIES. ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.
THEY LOVED THE PITCH. WE MET AROUND AND WE WENT TO CORK RAN AND PELICAN BAY WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR GUYS. I MET WITH A YOUNG ARSONIST NAME DBAFTON AND I LIKED HIMEL. I DECIDED THAT'S THE GUY I WANT TO DO THIS. I PITCHED THE OUTLINE TO HIM YOU KNOW MOST OF THE MAJOR PUBLISHERS IT'S PRISON LABOR
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
THEY DO ALL PRISON LABOR. [LAUGHTER] HERE IS HOW NAIVE I WAS. THIS IS EMBARRASSING BUT I WENT IN GOING LET'S JUST GET TED. THEY LOOKED AT ME LIKE, THIS GUY IS SUCH A NEWBIE. I WAS LIKE TED KACZYNSKI. EVER SINCE HE WROTE EAT PRAY LOVE NECESSARY DEMAND NOW.
Jon: YOU WANTED TO USE A PRISONER GHOST WRITER.
THEY MAKE YOU. YOU KNOW THAT EARTH, THE BOOK, WAS WRITTEN BY A WHITE SUPREMIST GANG. THEY DO -- ALL THE WHITE POWER GANGS DO THE HUMOR BOOKS AND THE COOK BOOKS. THAT'S ALL THEY DO. THEY HAVE THAT MARKET CORNERS. I WENT WITH DBAFTON AND HIS WAS THE GREAT THING, TOO. NORMALLY THE DUE DATE WAS A YEAR. HE STABBED A GUARD, WENT INTO SOLITARY, FINISHED IT IN TWO MONTHS. I WAS SO EXCITED, YEAH.
Jon: SO INTERESTING. TO GET A BOOK DONE ON DEADLINE YOU HAVE TO PRODUCT YOUR CON-- PROD YOUR CONVICT INTO VIOLENCE.
ACTUALLY I HEARD THAT JOHN HODGMAN, WHO HAS BEEN ON THE SHOW.
Jon: HE HAS, A FREQUENT GUEST, CONTRIBUTOR, A FINE MAN.
BOTH HIS BOOKS HE PICKED OUT GUYS AND STARTED SPRAOEDING RUMORS ON THE TEAR ABOUT THEM  AND THEY WOULD GO -- HE WOULD ALSO -- I'VE HEARD -- THIS I CAN'T CONFIRM THIS -- I HEARD  THAT HODGMAN FOR HIS SECOND BOOK SMUGGLED A TOOTH BRUSH HANDLED SHIV IN FOR A TKPWURD TO GIVE TO  A GUY. THAT'S A LEVEL OF WRITING I'M NOT AT YET SO --
Jon: THERE ARE -- I WAS WITH YOU FOR A LONG TIME. THERE RAY FEW PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD LESS SUITED TO ENGAGE WITH PRISONERS THAN JOHN HODGMAN.
OH, YEAH HE IS -- THAT GUY --
Jon: HE'S TRANSLUCENT.
IF YOU COULD WRAP MARSHMALLOWS IN A PILLOW THAT IS JOHN HODGMAN.
IF A HUG COULD WEAR A SUIT JNCH AND JUST AS SWEET.
SWEET AND EASY TO HIDE SHIVS IN APPARENTLY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I SAW THAT ON HIS RESUME UNDER TALENT.
ARCHIE -- ARCHERY, SHIV HIDING.
