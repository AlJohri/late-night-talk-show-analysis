FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE THE  "DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT,  MY FRIENDS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE,  MY GUEST TONIGHT, MY BEST FRIEND  IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. ( LAUGHTER )  BILL O'REILLY. EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE FROM THE  NETHERLANDS DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR  LOVE, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I'M FROM SWITZERLAND. HOW CAN YOU BE NEUTRAL ABOUT  HIM? ( LAUGHTER )  YESTERDAY, BUSY DAY ON CAPITOL  HILL. STARTING WITH THE SENATE FINANCE  COMMITTEE GRILLING OF FORMER  I.R.S. COMMISSIONER SCHULMAN AND MILLER ABOUT ALLEGED TARGETING  OF GROUPS APPLYING FOR 501(c)4  STATUS.
I REGRET THAT HAPPENED ON MY  WATCH.
Jon:  THAT WAS IN STARK  CONTRAST TO THAT MAN'S PREVIOUS  APPEARANCE BEFORE CONGRESS.
YES, I CAN GIVE YOU  ASSURANCES THERE'S ABSOLUTE NO  TARGETING. >>TARGETING.
Jon:  AND OF COURSE BY  "NO" I MEAN LOTS. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WHEN KIDS  SAY SOMETHING'S BAD BUT THEY  REALLY MEAN IT'S GOOD. AND WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING'S  PHAT-- WHICH I REALLY DON'T KNOW  ACTUALLY WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT  ANYWAY. AT THIS HEARING, WE WOULD  FINALLY GET THE DETAILS OF HOW  THESE GROUPS WERE TARGETED AND WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE. I WANT A FULL ACCOUNTING.
I WAS UNAWARE, I BELIEVE, AT  THE TIME, THAT IT HAD HAPPENED.
WHEN SOMEONE SPOTTED IT, THEY  SHOULD HAVE RUN UP THE CHAIN,  AND THEY DIDN'T.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT  THAT.
I DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT TIME.
I AM NOT AWARE OF THAT.
DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF ANYONE  DOING THAT. I DID NOT KNOW THAT. I'M NOT PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.
Jon:  I-- I SHOW UP TO  WORK DRUNK. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ. I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE I WON A  RADIO CONTEST. ( LAUGHTER )  DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW WHAT THE  HELL HAPPENED?
MY NAME IS LOIS LERNER, AND  I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE EXEMPT  ORGANIZATIONS AT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.
Jon:  BOOYAH. ( LAUGHTER )  BEAUTIFUL YOU, WERE IN CHARGE OF  THE DIVISION OVERCEASE THESE  501(c)4 APPLICATIONS SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY? WHAT HAPPENED?
I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING  WRONG. I HAVE NOT BROKEN ANY LAWS.
Jon:  WHO SAID ANYTHING  ABOUT BREAKING LAWS. ( LAUGHTER )  WE WERE JUST-- NO ONE'S ACCUSING  YOU. WE JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT  HAPPENED.
I'VE DECIDED TO FOLLOW MY  COUNSEL'S ADVICE AND NOT TESTIFY  OR ANSWER ANY OF THE QUESTIONS  TODAY.
HER NAME IS LOIS LERNER. SHE ANNOUNCES THAT SHE'S  INVOKING HER FIFTH AMENDMENT  RIGHT.
Jon:  HER FIFTH AMENDMENT  RIGHT! OH, MY GOD. SHE'S GOING TO START QUARTERING  SOLDIERS IN HER HOME WITHOUT  PERMISSION. HOLD ON A SECOND... SHE'S GOING  TO-- OH, SHE'S GIVING HER SLAVES  BACK. THAT'S NOT RIGHT! SHE'S REPEALING PROHIBITION? SHE'S-- NO, WAIT. SHE'S INVOKING THE RIGHT TO NOT  INCRIMINATE HERSELF. SO NOTHING FROM HER. FINE. WE DON'T NEED YOU. THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS  COMMITTEE SENT THE I.R.S. A  LETTER DEMANDING ALL ITS  SCANDAL-RELATED PAPERWORK BY MAY 21, AND TODAY IS MAY 20-- MORE  THAN THAT. SO RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE PROBABLY  GOING THROUGH THOSE PAPERS AND  THEN-- I'M SORRY WHAT'S THAT? THEY DIDN'T SEND IT? THE I.R.S. DIDN'T SEND IT IN? SO THE I.R.S. MISSED THEIR  FILING DEADLINE. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  BUT OF COURSE, THAT WASN'T THE  ONLY I.R.S.-RELATED HEARING ON THE HILL.
APPLES CHIEF TIM COOK FACING  SOME OUTRAGED SENATORS.
Jon:  FINALLY, SOME  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR APPLE MAPS. I MEAN, COME ON! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  MAYBE SOME PRISON TIME-- MAYBE  SOME PRISON TIME WILL MAKE THOSE GUYS THINK TWICE ABOUT DIRECTING  ME TO A CHIPOTLE IN THE MIDDLE  OF THE HUDSON RIVER. ( LAUGHTER )  ACTUALLY, APPLE C.E.O. TIM COOK  WAS CALLED IN TO FACE THE WRATH  OF SENATORS WONDERING HOW APPLE HAD AVOIDED PAYING TAXES ON $44  BILLION IN INCOME IN THE LAST  FOUR YEARS, IN PART BY STASHING OVER $100 BILLION IN NEARLY  TAX-FREE OFFSHORE SUBSIDIARIES.
I'M VERY PROUD OF APPLE.
WE LOVE THE iPHONE AND THE  iPADS. I GOT ONE RIGHT HERE.
YOU'VE McED TO CHANGE THE  WORLD, WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE  LEGEND.
I HARASSED MY HUSBAND UNTIL  HE CONVERTED TO A MAC BOOK.
YOUR PRODUCTS ARE GREAT.
MY GRANDDAUGHTER EVEN KNOWS  HOW TO USE IT.
I LOVE APPLE. I LOVE APPLE.
Jon:  I-- I WANT TO  I-( BLEEP ) YOU. WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? WHAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF A GENIUS  BAR? ( LAUGHTER )  APPARENTLY, THERE IS NOTHING  APPLE CAN DO TO GET AS MAD AT  THEM. THEY'RE DODGING TAXES WE CAN  FIND OUT THEY'RE USING KITTEN  HEARTS TO POWER iPHONES. AND WE'D BE LIKE, "WELL, IF IT  DOUBLES BATTERY LIFE, I'LL TAKE  TWO."  IN FACT, THE HEARING WAS LESS "WE'RE ANGRY AT YOU FOR BREAKING  CURFEW" AND MORE LIKE, "WHAT  TIME DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD GET HOME?"
IF YOU WERE IN OUR POSITION,  HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS  THAT WE CHANGE THE TAX CODE?
WHAT KEEPS ANOTHER COUNTRY IN  ONE OF THESE EMERGING MARKETS  FROM UNDERCUTTING US?
WHAT RATE DO YOU THINK WE  HAVE TO BE AT IF YOU WANT TO BE  COMPETITIVE?
DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD BE  ABLE TO DEDUCT THE INTEREST.
Jon:  HOW ABOUT? HOW ABOUT WE PAY YOU FOR THE  INCONVENIENCE OF KEEPING YOUR  MONEY OVERSEAS. THE UPKEEP MUST BE UNBELIEVABLE,  LIKE HAVING A PONY. ( LAUGHTER )  NOT THAT APPLE C.E.O. TIM COOK  WASN'T HAPPY TO OFFER  SUGGESTIONS.
APPLE HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IN  THE SIMPLE, NOT THE COMPLEX. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT WE  RECOMMEND A DRAMATIC  SIMPLIFICATION OF THE CORPORATE TAX CODE.
Jon:  I GIVE YOU THE TAX  CODE NANO. ( LAUGHTER )  SO, WHAT WOULD THE NANOENTAIL?
ELIMINATE ALL CORPORATE TAX  EXPENDITURES, LOWER CORPORATE  INCOME TAX RATES. AND IMPLEMENT A REASONABLE TAX  ON FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT ALLOWS  THE FREE FLOW OF CAPITAL BACK TO THE UNITED STATES.
Jon:  WOW. ALL THAT SIMPLIFICATION IN  CLOSING OF LOOPHOLES WOULD BE  GREAT. UNTIL, OF COURSE, OIL COMPANIES  LOBBY TO MAKE SURE THE R & D  EXPLORATION TAX CREDITS STAY IN  PLACE. AND AGRAMAKES SURE EQUIPMENT  DEPRECIATION STAYS IN THERE  BECAUSE THAT'S THE RUB OF THIS ENTIRE EXERCISE. CORPORATIONS ARE THE ONLY REASON  THE TAX CODE IS SO COMPLICATED  IN THE FIRST PLACE. THOSE OFFSHORE LOOPHOLES DIDN'T  GET CARVED OUT BY POOR PEOPLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). OUR TAX CODE IS PURPOSEFULLY--  OUR TAX CODE IS PURPOSEFULLY  COMPLEX SO THAT CORPORATIONS WITH RESOURCES ARE THE ONLY ONES  WHO CAN FIND THE BURIED GOODIES  THEIR OWN LOBBYISTS HAVE HIDDEN IN THE LABYRINTH. AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE  THINKING-- BUT THIS IS APPLE. THEY BELIEVE INICISM PLIFT. ( LAUGHTER )  THEY WOULDN'T USE COMPLEXITY,  JUST WHEN IT SUITS THEIR OWN  BUSINESS NEEDS. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  YOU'D AGREE WITH THAT, RIGHT? DO YOU AGREE? JUST ( BLEEP ) HIT AGREE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
