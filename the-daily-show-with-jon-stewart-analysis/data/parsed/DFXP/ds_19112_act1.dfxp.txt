JUNE 3RD, 2014. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: WELCOME TO THE SHOW. MY  NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN, DO WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT ON THIS VERY NIGHT WE HAVE -- YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS RICHARD GERVAIS. HE IS A COMEDIAN OF NOTE FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM. VERY EXCITING. BUT FIRST, VERY BIG STORY BROKE CONCERNING OUR NOW TEENAGE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN. OBVIOUSLY, THE TEENAGE YEARS ARE TOUGH FOR EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY WARS. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENED.
BREAKING NEWS A GOOD NEWS STORY U.S. ARMY SERGEANT BOWE BERGDAHL WHO HAS BEEN IN CAPTIVITY IN AFGHANSTAN FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS WAS RELEASED BY THE TALIBAN.
ACROSS THE BOARD THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL STORY.
JON: YES, THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT TIME FOR A BRAND NEW SEGMENT "A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL STORY." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JON: YOU KNOW IT'S SO RARE. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO AMAZING. IT'S SO RARE AMERICA GETS A STORY LIKE THIS, MAGNIFICENT AND WONDERFUL. SO IF IT'S OKAY WITH EVERYONE HERE I THINK WE SHOULD RIDE THIS PATRIOT TRAIN TO [BEEP] YEAH JUNCTION.
EVERYONE IS REJOICING THAT HE'S SAFE AND HE WILL GET TO GO BACK TO HIS LOVING PARENTS IN IDAHO. BUT, IT'S A COMPLICATED CASE.
JON: IT'S A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL STORY. WHAT'S COMPLICATED ABOUT AMERICA RULES? WE GOT OUR LAST P.O.W. BACK. DID YOU NOT SEE THE BLUE BIRD? I GOT THIS, PHIL. COMPLICATED HOW?
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS STANDING BY IT'S DECISION TO RELEASE FIVE SENIOR MEMBERS FROM GUANTANAMO BAY IN A PRISONER EXCHANGE FOR BERGDAHL.
THEY HAVE, IN FACT, NEGOTIATED WITH TERRORISTS. AND, I DON'T THINK THEY GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL.
JON:  WOW, I DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THOSE PICTURES WAS SCARIER. WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE ALWAYS NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS. SAYING WE DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS IS OUR OPENING NEGOTIATION PIT. WE ARE NOT NEGOTIATING WITH YOU, TERRORISTS. AND YOUR RESPONSE IS. THAT'S PATHETIC. THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THIS SWAP IS A CLICHE. YOU WOULDN'T CATCH THE ADMINISTRATION COUNTERING WITH A CLICHE.
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT LEAVE OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM BEHIND.
JON: TOUCHE, CLICHE. ALRIGHT. Y'ALL WANT TO HAVE A CLICHE OFF. LET'S DO THIS, BRO.
WE DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS.
WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND.
YOU DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS.
WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND.
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS. >>YOU NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND.
WE DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS. >>A GOOD SOLDIER NEVER LEAVES A MAN BEHIND.
JON: YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY -- THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY
JON: YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY -- THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY WAY -- THE ONLY WAY TO END A CLICHE-OFF IS TO AGREE TO DISAGREE. ALRIGHT A MAGNIFICENT COMPLICATED WONDERFUL STORY. HAPPY? CAN WE GET BACK TO IT AND ENJOY THE SHINING MOMENT FOR OUR NATION.
ALL OF THE EARLY JOY AND CELEBRATION OF BERGDAHL'S RELEASE HAS BEEN CLOUDED OVER SEVERAL GROWING CONTROVERSE
JON: SEVERAL. WE NEGOTIATED WITH TERRORISTS. IT'S ONE CONTROVERSY.
DID THE PRESIDENT BREAK THE LAW?
DO YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS ENDANGERED THE COUNTRY.
DOES THIS BECOME AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE?
JON: ALRIGHT. FINE. A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL COMPLICATED CLOUDED CONTROVERSIAL STORY. FINE. BUT, THAT'S IT. IT'S ONLY BEEN LIKE A DAY AND A HALF. AREN'T WE FORGETTING THE REAL HERO HERE? THE AMERICAN HERO WHO PERSEVERED FOR FIVE YEARS IN A TALIBAN PRISON CAMP OR TALIBAMP, TRADEMARK JON STEWART.
IT'S THE QUESTION MANY WANT THE ANSWER TO. EXACTLY WHO IS SERGEANT BOWE BERGDAHL.
JON: OH, BERGDAHL. IS THAT HOW WE'RE PRONOUNCING IT NOW? THE PURPOSEFUL MISPRONUNCIATION OF THE SOLDIER'S LAST NAME TO MAKE IT SOUND ARABIC IS NOT PURPOSEFUL. I MEAN, SEAN HANNITY IS NOT AN ASS-HOLE RIGHT. I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? ALTHOUGH MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PERSON WE DON'T KNOW.
HE WANDERED OFF THE POST ON HIS OWN. HE LEFT A NOTE BEHIND SAYING HE HAD BECOME DISILLUSIONED WITH THE WAR.
SOME ARE CALLING HIM A DESERTER.
SOME OF HIS FELLOW COMRADES IN AFGHANISTAN ARE CALLING HIM A COWARD AND EVEN A TRAITOR.
JON: THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE OUR MOMENT. TURNS OUT IT'S OUR MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL STORY, MAY BE COMPLICATED, CLOUDY, CONTROVERSIAL AND POSSIBLY TREASONIST. BUT WE DID IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE IT'S A DIFFICULT STORY. IT'S COMPLICATED. WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS. IT'S NOT LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO MAKE A BIG ROSE GARDEN ANNOUNCEMENT, BRING OUT THE GUY'S PARENTS, WITH ONE OF THEM I KILLED BIN LADEN AGAIN MOMENTS. PRESIDENT: BOB, JANNY TODAY FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA SHARE IN THE JOY THAT I KNOW YOU FEEL.
JON: OH [BEEP]. I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON PRESS CONFERENCES OR AMERICAN REACTIONS TO THINGS. BUT, MY GUESS IS THAT PRISONER'S DAD WILL NOT GO UNREMARKED ON.
ROBERT BERGDAHL, THE FATHER HAS LEARNED TO SPEAK PASHTO THE LANGUAGE OF THE TALIBAN AND LOOKS LIKE A MUSLIM.
HE SAYS HE WAS GROWING HIS BEARD BECAUSE HIS SON WAS IN CAPTIVITY. WELL, HIS SON IS OUT NOW. SO, IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE A MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN. ARE YOU OUT OF RAZORS?
JON: WELL, THAT GOT UGLY PRETTY FAST. FIRST OF ALL, WHO THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU TO JUDGE WHAT A GUY DOES IF HE THINKS IT MIGHT HELP HIM GET HIS SON BACK. I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE YOUR HATRED OF FACIAL HAIR THERE, FRIEND, BUT MY GUESS IS IF YOU GAVE BOB BERGDAHL A BANDANNA AND A DUCK YOU WOULD LIKE HIM JUST [BLEEP] FINE. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? [ APPLAUSE ]
JON: HOW DID A SIMPLE CLEAR CUT STORY OF AMERICAN HEROISM IN A WAR GET COMPLICATED. OH RIGHT. IT'S A WAR. THAT'S WEIRD. THREE DAYS AGO THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GREAT [BEEP] MOVIE. NOW I COULDN'T SELL THIS TO LIFETIME WITH ALYSSA MALANO. IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS, REMEMBER.
BREAKING NEWS. A GOOD NEWS STORY.
IT'S A MAGNIFICENT WONDERFUL STORY.
WE NEGOTIATED WITH TERRORISTS.
THE TALIBAN DREAM TEAM.
ODDS ARE, ONE OR TWO OUT OF THESE FIVE ARE GOING TO GET BACK IN THE FIGHT.
DID PRESIDENT OBAMA BREAK THE LAW?
YES.
HEADLINES LIKE "BOWE BERGDAHL ISN'T A HERO ."
HE SAID I'M ASHAMED TO EVEN BE AMERICAN.
BRAND NEW EVIDENCE HE MAY OF BEEN HELPING THE ENEMY.
JON: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. [ APPLAUSE ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
