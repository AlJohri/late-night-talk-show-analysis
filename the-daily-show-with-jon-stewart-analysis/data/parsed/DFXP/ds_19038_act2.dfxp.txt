[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. 47 MILLION, BELIEVE THIS FIGURE IS RIGHT. 47 MILLION AMERICANS ON FOOD STAMPS TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS. IT'S WHY CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS GOT TOGETHER TO PUT THEM ON A DIET. LOOKING TO CUT $40 BILLION FROM THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM. LUCKILY THE DEMOCRATS WERE THERE TO KEEP THE CUTS TO $4 BILLION ON TOP OF $5 BILLION THAT WENT IN EFFECT. GOOD TIMES. JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS MORE.
SINCE THE SEQUESTER $5 BILLION CUT FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR SNAP LEAVING THE AMERICANS WHO RELY ON FOOD STAMPS IN JEOPARDY. DESPITE MORE CUTS ON THE HORIZON, NOT EVERYONE IS CONVINCED IT WILL BE BAD FOR AMERICA'S POOR. FORBES COLUMNIST JOHN TAMNY.
I WOULD ABOLISH SNAP ALTOGETHER. I THINK FOOD STAMPS ARE CRUEL.
I'M SORRY, DID YOU SAY THAT FOOD STAMPS ARE CRUEL?
YES, I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS HAPPY IF THEY ARE RELIANT ON SOMEONE ELSE. IF THEY ARE TAKING A HANDOUT.
WHAT ABOUT KIDS BEING HUNGRY? NOBODY GETTING FOOD THEY DESERVE OR NEED?
IF PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY STARVING YOU WOULD SEE A MASSIVE OUTPOURING OF CHARITY TO MAKE UP FOR THAT FACT.
WHAT DOES LITERALLY STARVING LOOK LIKE?
IT'S GOING TO COME OFF THE WRONG WAY BUT I GUESS PEOPLE HAVE DISTENDED BELLIES WHERE THEY ARE GETTING NOTHING. WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE POOR STARVING ON THE STREETS.
I WONDER IF THERE'S PROGRAMS IN PLACE STOPPING PEOPLE FROM STARVING IN THE STREETS?
I WONDER, TOO. I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANY OF THEM. SOMETHING TELLS ME THEY DON'T EXIST BUT I'VE NOT HEARD OF ANY SUCH PROGRAMS.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE HEARD OF ONE.
I WOULD ABOLISH SNAP ALL TOGETHER.
NEVER HEARD OF IT. DON'T WORRY POOR PEOPLE THIS IS THE UNITED (bleep) STATES OF AMERICA I HAVE GREAT NEWS FOR YOU.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE POOR THIS, IS THE COUNTRY YOU WANT TO BE POOR IN.
IT'S AMAZING.
MOST OF THE EVEN THE POOR THAT ARE ABLE TO EAT, THEY HAVE PLUMBING.
REALLY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T STEP IN TO HELP PEOPLE UNTIL THEY GET TO (bleep) POOR.
IF PEOPLE ARE STARVING PRIVATE CHARITIES WILL FILL THE BREECH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT FILLING. PRIVATE CHARITY WOULD STEP UP WHERE IT'S NEEDED.
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS REPLACE THE $80 BILLION IN FUNDS THAT SNAP PROVIDES WITH $5 BILLION CHARITIES CURRENTLY SUPPLY. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL COVER IF YOU SPIN IT ENOUGH. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE OUR KIDS TO LEARN HUNTING AND FORGING TECHNIQUES TO EAT.
THEY WON'T NEED TO THE MEDIA WOULD DO A GOOD JOB OF EXPOSING PEOPLE WHO NEED TO EAT.
THE MEDIA WOULD HELP BY FILMING POOR PEOPLE STARVING AND BROADCAST THAT ON NATIONAL TV.
THEY WOULD.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH THE WAY I HEARD IT. THAT SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR, A DYSTOPIAN WORLD WHERE POOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING ON TV IT'S THE HUNGER GAMES! JOHN JUST SOLVED EVERYTHING.
LET'S REMEMBER ALSO THAT HUNGER GAMES IS A STORY. IT DOESN'T DESCRIBE THE UNITED STATES. HUNGER GAMES IS ONLY LIKE THE UNITED STATES IN THE SENSE THAT --
THAT IT TAKES PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES AND --
I LIVE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND WASHINGTON, D.C. IS BOOMING AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING.
YOU MEAN THE CAPITOL.
THE CAPTAL CITY IS BOOMING --
HOW IS THAT NOT THE HUNGER -- GAMES? HUNGER GAMES DESCRIBES A POOR COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE SCROUNGING.
HAVE YOU BEEN TO DETROIT?
WE DON'T SEND THE POOR TO THE UNITED STATES INTO BATTLE KILLING EACH OTHER.
NO, BUT THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD START.
THERE'S A NEW PLAN IN TENNESSEE THAT AFFECTS FAMILY WELFARE PAYMENT AND TIES THEM TO WELFATHE CHILDREN OF THOSEHEM TO RECIPIENTS' PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOL. YOU GET LOWER GRADES YOU GET LOWER PAYMENTS.
WHILE IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED ANOTHER ONE. I GATHER POTENTIAL TRIBUTES FROM MANHATTAN'S PS32 TO SEE IF THEY WERE READY FOR BATTLE.
WHO HAD BREAKFAST IN THIS MORNING? THEY WERE CLEARLY OVERFED. IT'S LIKE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO INFLICT HARM ON ONE OTHER. SO CUTE. I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU. CUTE IS NOT (bleep) WHEN THE HUNGER GAMES GOES DOWN. MAYBE IF I KEPT THEM OUT THERE LONG ENOUGH THEY WOULD GET SCRAPPY. EVERYBODY SEE THAT SHE'S HUNGRY. ALL RIGHT, KIDS, JUICE BOX TIME. HOW DESPERATE WILL THEY GET? THE KIDS JUST MIGHT BE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO BE HUNGRY. TRY THIS. YEP. NOW AIM FOR THE HUNGRIEST ONE. [  APPLAUSE  ]
