( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST OF  CNN INTERNATIONAL'S AMMAN PORAND  THE GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANCHOR FOR ABC NEWS. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM, CHRISTINE AMANPOUR. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I WANT TO TALK TO YOU,  OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE IN THE FIELD AND I  WANT TO TALK, I GUESS, ABOUT THE  HUMANITARIAN CRISIS UNFOLDING BEFORE EVERYBODY'S EYES. HOW ARE THINGS AT CNN? ( LAUGHTER )
YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO KNOW  THAT THEY ARE METRIC TONS LOADS  OF GOOD WILL AT CNN, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE BUILT BY BIGGER AND  BETTER --
YOU'RE COMING BACK STROK.
STRONG.
Jon:  OH, THIS IS  CHINATOWNING.
STRONG UP AND KNOW WHAT? I WANT TO BET, AND I WILL BE  WETTING ON CNN WINNING. AND I THINK EVERYBODY WILL.
Jon:  HERE'S THE THING  THAT EVERYONE ELSE--
YOU NEED --
THE ONLY REASON IS BECAUSE WE  CARE SO MUCH.
EXACTLY.
Jon:  BECAUSE CNN IS--  IT'S GOT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S GOT ALL THOSE GOOD PEOPLE  AND EVERY TIME I TURN IT ON I  SEE SOMEBODY STANDING ON A HOLODECK WITH A  THREE-DIMENSIONAL THING--
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR A  WHILE.
Jon:  NO, I HAVEN'T.
IT WAS FUN AND IT WAS DICHED. BUT NOW NEW LEADERSHIP.
Jon:  HERE'S WHAT I SAY,  EMPOWER AMANPOR. HAVE YOU BEEN TO SYRIA RECENTLY?
NOT RECENTLY, NO, I HAVEN'T  BUT I'M COVERING IT DAILY ON MY  PROGRAM WHICH IS ON CNN INTERNATIONAL, AND IT'S BECOME  ALMOST FRONT AND CENTER HERE IN  THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S WONDERING  WILL THE U.S. DO ANYTHING? THERE'S A BIG DEBATE GOING ON. AS YOU SAID, THE HUMANITARIAN  SITUATION, NOT AT CNN BUT IN  JORDAN AND AROUND THE --
RIGHT.
THE NEIGHBORHOODS THERE.
Jon:  COMING FROM SYRIA,  YOU'VE GOT 500,000 REFUGEES  POURING INTO JORDAN. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY HAVE THE  INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH  THAT?
THEY DON'T. THERE ARE MORE THAN A MILLIONING  REFUGEES. TURKEY, JORDAN, LEBANON, AND  THEY'RE REALLY STRETCHING THE  RESOURCES, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A VERY UNSTABLE PROBLEM.
Jon:  JUDGEY IS THAT NOT  MORE OF THE CONVERSATION? THE CONVERSATION ALWAYS SEEMS TO  BE DO YOU WANT TO PUT BOOTS ON  THE GROUND? DO WE WANT TO FIRE TBROMS HERE? WHAT'S THE RED LINE? IF THEY CROSS THAT LINE, WE'LL  HAVE TO SHOOT THAT GUY. WHY ALSO ARE THE GOVERNMENTS NOT  MOBILIZING SUMMIT FOR THESE  REFUGEES? THERE ARE ONE MILLION PEOPLE --
THE U.N. TRIES AND THE THING  IS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF  REFUGEE FATIGUE. THERE'S A LOT OF CRISIS FATIGUE  AROUND THE WORLD. AND THE TRUTH IS THOSE COUNTRIES  WHO ARE ABSORBING THESE REFUGEES  ARE DOING THE WEST A HUGE FAVOR. BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T, THEN  WHAT WOULD BE HAPPENING? MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED  AND MORE PRESSURE WOULD COME --
THEY'RE DOING THE ENTIRE  REGION A FAVOR. BUT DON'T MOST OF THOSE  COUNTRIES CLOSE THEIR BORDERS?
NO, THEY'RE NOT CLOSING THEIR  BORDERS RIGHT NOW.
Jon:  HASN'T JORDAN TAKEN  REACTING REFUGEES AND THEN  SYRIAN REFUGEES?
IT'S ONE THING AFTER THE NEXT  AND JORDAN IS NOT THE RICHEST  COUNTRY IN THE AREA. A VERY, VERY STRONG U.S. ALLY,  AND IN FACT U.S. SPECIAL FORCES  ARE THERE RIGHT NOW, ALL SORTS OF PLANS ARE BEING DRAWN UP IF  IN FACT THEY DO HAVE TO GO IN  AND SECURE CHEMICAL WEAPON  SITES. JORDAN IS A KEY INTELLIGENCE AND  MILITARY PARTNER WITH THE UNITED  STATES, AND IS TAKING, YOU KNOW, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE  POOR MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN  FLEEING THE BRUTALITY. AND --
ARE THEY GET MONEY?
NOT ENOUGH.
Jon:  WE ARE SENDING ALL  KIND OF 99 MANN--
NOT ENOUGH TO JORDAN. NOT ENOUGH TO JORDAN. AND THEY'RE WORRIED THEY WILL  BREAK UNDER THE STRAIN. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD  ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT.
Jon:  THE SERIN GAS WAS  THE RED LINE. EVERYBODY SAID THEY CROSS THAT  LINE, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon:  THEY HAVE  APPARENTLY CROSSED THAT RED  LINE, AND OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN... I SEE A MAGENTA,  AIBILITY OF A MAROON LINE. I SEE THEY'VE COME ACROSS A  CERTAIN AREA-- BUT ISN'T THAT  BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO? EVEN IF WE WANT TO.
I THINK IT'S MORE DON'T WANT  TO DO. PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ABOUT ENDING  WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. HE DOES NOT WANT TO GO OFF INTO  ANOTHER WAR. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF  JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY,  CERTAINLY, THE MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND AMERICAN  POLITICAL LEADERS DON'T WANT TO  DO THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT I THINK A CASE CAN BE BUILT  AND PERHAPS SHOULD BE BUILT TO  STOP THE SLAUGHTER. IT'S A MORAL IMPERATIVE. AND IT'S ALSO A STRATEGIC  IMPERATIVE. BOUGHT BAUZ IF IT DOESN'T AND IT  DOESN'T STOP, IT'S GOING TO  REALLY AFFECT AMERICA'S INTERESTS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I  DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU OR  ANYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WHAT HAPPENS OVERSEAS EVENTUALLY  BLOWS BACK HERE.
Jon:  NO, YOU DO NEED TO  TELL US. WE'VE ALL BEEN WATCHING LIKE,  THE VOICE."  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS  GOING ON. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU, YOU DO  NEED TO TELL US, AND YOU'RE LIKE  I'M ON CNN INTERNATIONAL. AND THEY'RE ALL JUST RUNNING  AROUND BOSTON LIKE THIS. I JUST HEARD A DOG! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCHEDULE  GOING ON! WE DO NEED IT. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO CRUCIAL. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A  BREAK AND WE'LL COME BACK WITH  MORE OF THE WISDOM FROM CHRISTINE AMANPOUR. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
