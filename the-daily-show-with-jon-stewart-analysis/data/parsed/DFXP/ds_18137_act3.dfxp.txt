MY GUEST TONIGHT CURIOUS MAN,  PLEASE WELCOME NEIL THOMPSON. NEIL, WE WERE TALKING A  LITTLE BACKSTAGE, HOW IS IT  POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS THE  FIRST AND ONLY BIOGRAPHY WRITTEN ABOUT SUCH A WEIRD  AMERICAN MAN.
SUCH A WEIRD AMERICAN  MAN. A BRILLIANT WEIRD AMERICAN  MAN. I THINK IT JUST SORT OF IS  FORGOTTEN GUY, THIS OVERLOOK  LIFD. I'M NOT SURE HOW IT HAPPENED  BUT I'M GLAD I STUMBLED UPON  IT.
LET'S PUT IT IN CONTEXT  THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST  POPULAR MEN IN AMERICA OVER  DECADES.
YUP, YUP.
HUGELY INFLUENTIAL DURING  HIS DAY, HUGELY WEALTHY,  FAMOUS, POPULAR. HE WAS SORT OF THE PT BARNUM  CHARACTER CROSSED WITH HUGH  HEFNER, TRAVELED THE WORLD.
THAT IS A HELL OF A  CROSS.
I KNOW.
PT BARNUM CROSSED WITH  HUGH HEFNER THAT IS AN  UNGODLY.
OKAY.
ELMER FUDD.
OH MY GOD.
I CAN SEE IT, YES.
RIPLY WAS INSPIRATION FOR  THE ORIGINAL ELMER FUDD.
THAT'S HOW POPULAR HE WAS,  HOW WELL-KNOWN HE WAS.
HE WAS HUGELY, WE NOW  KNOW HIM MAINLY AS THOSE ODD  LIKE AT TK CITY BELIEVE IT OR NOT MUSEUMS BUT HE WAS A  CARTOONIST AT A TIME WHEN  CARTOONISTS KIND OF RAN  AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS.
YEAH, YACHLT IT'S  INTERESTING TO TRACK HIS  STORY. AND THIS IS WHAT I LOVE  ABOUT IT, THIS RAGS TO  RICHES STORY, SOW STARTS OUT  AS THIS POOR BUCK TOOTHED, STUTTERING, AWKWARD MISFIT  OF A KID BUT FINDING  SOMETHING HE IS GOOD AT  WHICH IS CAR TOOK. HE TRANSFERS THAT INTO  BELIEVE IT OR NOT CONCEPT  AND LITTLE BY LITTLE THAT  GROWS. THEN BECOMES MORE POPULAR. BUT HE TOILED IN OBSCURITY  FOR A LONG TIME UNTIL HE HIT  THE BIG TIME IN THE 1930s. AND THAT'S WHEN HE TOOK OFF  AND TOOK THIS BELIEVE IT OR  NOT IDEA TO RADIO, TO FILM, TO MUSEUMS. BEST SELLING BOOKS, IN  ADDITION TO HIS CARTOONS. IT WAS ALSO BUILT AROUND  INITIALLY THE CARTOON WHICH  IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HIS DAY THAT IS HOW PEOPLE GOT THEIR  VISUAL, YOU KNOW. HE WOULD DRAW PICTURES FROM  SOME FOREIGN PLACE OR OF  SOME RELIGIOUS FANATIC IN  INDIA DOING SOMETHING HORRIBLE TO HIS BODY AND  THAT'S HOW PEOPLE LEARNED  ABOUT OTHER CULTURES.
WHICH HE HAD OFTEN SEEN. IT WAS THOUGHT THAT AT ONE  POINT HE IS WAS PO  SSIBLY THE  MOST TRAVELED HUMAN BEING ON  EARTH. HE WAS LIKE A ONE-MAN  WALKING INTERNET FOR A  WHILE.
HE WAS. LIKE THE WICK PEDESTRIAN YAF  HIS ERA IN A SENSE. WHAT WAS GREAT ABOUT  RESEARCHING HIS LIFE IS THAT  HE ACTUALLY WENT TO ALL  THESE PLACES THAT HE BROUGHT TO PEOPLE IN THEIR DAILY  NEWSPAPER OR ON THEIR RADIO  PROGRAMS. HE TRAVELED OBSESSIVELY. AND TO REALLY REMOTE CORNERS  OF THE WORLD AT A TIME WHEN  IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THE PEAK OF HIS FAME WAS  DURING THE DEPRESSION. SO HE WAS REALLY OUT THERE.
YEAH, HE SPANNED AN  AMAZING TIME FROM THE FIRST  WORLD WAR THROUGH THE WALL STREET CRASH NOT SECOND  WORLD WAR, SOMEHOW MANAGED  TO BE WELL IN THAT WHOLE  TIME. DID YOU LIKE HIM AS A MAN?
I ABSOLUTELY DID. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION THOCHLT  YOU START RESEARCHING  SOMEBODY, SOMETHING, YOU  THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THEM AND WANT TO SPEND TIME  WITH THEM. I NEVER GOT BOARD OF THIS  GUY.
I SWUNG BACK AND FORTH  FROM KIND OF ROOTING FOR HIM  THINKING THIS IS AN UNDERDOG, HE HAS A CHILDLIKE  CURIOSITY. HE SEEMS TO SWAY FROM  CHILDLIKE CURIOSITY TO  ADULT-LIKE IGNORANCE.
WELL, YOU KNOW.
WHEN HE TRAVEL ADD BROAD  HE COULD BE OFFENSIVE. WHEN I SAY COULD BE, HE  COULD BE AND WAS.
HE COULD -- YES. HE COULD BE A TOTAL BOTHER. HE WAS THE GUY, THE UGLY  AMERICAN TRAVELER. HE WOULD GO SOMEPLACE AND  FLAT OUT REFUSE TO LEARN  THEIR LANGUAGE.
OR TALK LOUDER.
TO SPEAK ENGLISH LOUDER  THAT IS HOW HE DEALT WITH  FOREIGN LANGUAGES.
AND HE SEEMED TO SEE AS A  KIND OF CURIOSITY BUT NOT A  PROBLEM THAT NEEDED TO BE  SOLVED. LIKE HE SAW TERRIBLE PROBLEM  WITH-- STARVATION IN INDIA  AND CHINA AND WAS AFFECTED BY IT BUT NEVER TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT, HE SAID  WHATEVER HE WITNESSED HE  WANT READY TO REFORM THE  WORLD. AND HE TALKS ABOUT PEOPLE  LIKE THE ZOO ANIMALS, LOOK,  CHECK, I GOT THEM, GOT A  LOVELY CARTOON OF THAT BOY JUST STARVING IN THE CORNER,  LOVELY.
HE WAS THIS  ANTHROPOLOGIST. I THINK HE HAD SOME SYMPATHY  FOR THE PEOPLE HE SAW BUT  WHAT CODO ABOUT IT, HE WAS A  CARTOONIST. I THINK HE VIEWED HIS JOB AS  SEEING WEIRD STUFF FROM  AROUND THE WORLD AND  BRINGING IT BACK TO AMERICA AND TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT  THESE OTHER PLACES.
AND THEN FROM THE  CARTOONS HE THEN BECOMES A  PIONEER OF RADIO TECHNOLOGY.
PEOPLE CAST IN THE BOTTOM  OF THE GRAND CANYON IS  THOUGHT HE IS THE FIRST PERSON TO BROADCAST TO THE  WHOLE WORLD AND THEN A  TAFERPING ITS MICROPHONE TO  A PARACHUTE JUMPER SO PEOPLE CAN HEAR WHAT IT WILL BE  LIKE JUMPING FROM A PLANE  AND WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IS  THIS.
E OH MY GOD.
BUT DID IS THAT KIND OF  CURIOSITY THAT DOES S SO  APPEALING.
YEAH. AND HE'S AN APPEALING GUY  ULTIMATELY BECAUSE HE'S SUCH  A GOOF BAUCHLT HE FIND ITS EVERYTHING CURIOUS AND  FASCINATING AND INTERESTING  AND WEEFERMENTD HE'S LIKE A  CHILD.
GOT IT.
IT'S A FASCINATING STORY,  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING  HERE.
CURIOUS MANSON THE BOOK  SHELVES NOW, NEIL THOMPSON.
