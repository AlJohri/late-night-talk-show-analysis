Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. VERY EXCITED TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, WE'RE VERY  EXCITED, KING ABDULLAH OF JORDAN  IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE  PROGRAM TONIGHT, VERY EXCITED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BUT FIRST-- BUT FIRST I HAVE A  QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU. (LAUGHTER)  A FELLOW IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT  BEFORE THE SHOW, A FELLOW IN THE  AUDIENCE ASKED A NICE LADY TO MARRY HIM. HERE'S THE CRAZY PART: MET HER  IN LINE. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  NO. EIGHT YEARS. THEY'VE BEEN GOING OUT FOR EIGHT  YEARS. IT WAS--  (APPLAUSE). IT WAS A VERY MOVING AND HEART  FELT MOMENT. I THOUGHT PUNCTUATED BY THE  PHRASE-- WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE  A HALLMARK CARD--  (LAUGHTER)  "(BLEEP) YEAH I'LL MARRY YOU." (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  BEAUTIFUL. GOT YOU RIGHT HERE. GOT YOU RIGHT HERE. VERY EXCITING. AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE CANADIAN  SO THEIR BABIES, I'M SURE, WILL  BE GAY SOCIALISTS. (LAUGHTER)  WHATEVER IT IS CANADIANS MAKE UP  THERE. I DON'T KNOW. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, KING ABDULLAH, OF  COURSE, HE IS IN NEW YORK CITY  FOR THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY,  OR, AS WE LIKE TO THINK OF IT, THE REASON I CAN'T GET TO WORK  BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC! (LAUGHTER)  THE EVENT HAS S A GATHERING IN  THE INTERNATIONAL JUGGALOS. WITH LIBYA IN TURMOIL, SYRIA IN  FLAMES, IRAN ON THE VERGE OF A  NUCLEAR WEAPON, AN INCREDIBLE  OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR PRESIDENT NOT JUST TO ADDRESS THE WORLD  COMMUNITY BUT FOR SOME  HIGH-LEVEL PRES-ON-PRES ACTION.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS HE HAS  NO PLANS TO HAVE ANY PRIVATE  LEADINGS WITH WORLD LEADERS.
Jon: OH. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, THAT'S-- PROBABLY  PROTOCOL. IT'S NOT THE TIME FOR ONE-ON-ONE  MEETINGS WITH OTHER WORLD  LEADERS!
OUR RESEARCH SHOWS IT'S BEEN  20 YEARS SINCE A PRESIDENT HAS  BEEN TO THAT MEETING AND NOT MET ONE ON ONE WITH A FOREIGN  LEADER. (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: OH. (LAUGHTER)  WELL, I GUESS IF THE WORLD  LEADERS WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH  HIM PERSONALLY THEY CAN JUST  DONATE $5 TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND TAKE THEIR CHANCES LIKE THE REST  OF US. (LAUGHTER)  SERIOUSLY. I'M SURE THERE'S A GOOD REASON  WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOT GOING  TO BE FACE TO FACE WITH WORLD  LEADERS IN THESE DIFFICULT AND HISTORIC TIMES.
THE PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY HAS A  BUSY SCHEDULE. HE HAS A BUSY SCHEDULE ALL TIME.
Jon: YEAH, HE'S GOT A BUSY  SCHEDULE! (LAUGHTER)  HE CAN'T JUST BE MEETING EVERY  WORLD LEADER WILLY-NILLY! (LAUGHTER)  JUST BECAUSE HE'S NOT MEETING  THEM FACE TO FACE DOESN'T MEAN  HE'S NOT FILLED WITH HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC ROOM DEFCON ECONOMIC  SIMULATIONS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL APPEAR  ON "THE VIEW" THIS MORNING. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: MOMENTS LIKE THESE IN  AN ELECTION SEASON THAT YOU  WOULD THINK WOULD BE CRUSHING  OBAMA'S REELECTION CHANCES. AND YET THEY ARE NOT. WHY, YOU ASK? (LAUGHTER)  IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S  NEWS SEGMENT "BARACK OBAMA'S THE  LUCKIEST DUDE ON THE PLANET." (LAUGHTER)  IN AN ORDINARY ELECTION  INVOLVING A STAGNANT ECONOMY,  GLOBAL UNREST, AND THE TYPICAL  INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WOULD BE AT AN ENORMOUS DISADVANTAGE. UNLESS--
DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE A  RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE HEALTH  CARE TO THE 50 MILLION AMERICANS WHO DON'T HAVE IT TODAY?
WELL, WE DO PROVIDE CARE FOR  PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE. WE PICK THEM UP IN AN AMBULANCE  AND TAKE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL  AND GIVE THEM CARE AND DIFFERENT  STATES HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF PROVIDING FOR THAT CARE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: UNLESS-- NORMALLY HE  WOULD BE IN TROUBLE UNLESS THAT  INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IS RUNNING  AGAINST THE GUY WHO JUST APPEARED TO SUGGEST THAT WE  DON'T NEED TO DO A HEALTH CARE  PLAN FOR UNINSURED AMERICANS  BECAUSE WE HAVE EMERGENCY ROOMS! (LAUGHTER)  AND, LIKE, THEY'RE OPEN ALL  NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  THEY'RE, LIKE, 7-ELEVENS BUT--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOW THAT-- WHAT HE JUST SAID IS  AN AMAZING AND UNAPPEALING TO -LSY STATEMENT WHICH ON ITS OWN  WOULD PERHAPS LEVEL THE FIELD  FOR THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT BUT  APPARENTLY LEVELING THE FIELD ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR  MASSACHUSETTS MITT "UP UNTIL I  WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN THE  REPUBLICAN PRIMARY I BELIEVED FERVENTLY IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE  OF WHAT I TOLD CBS' SKOEPT"  ROMNEY, WHICH IS ALSO A TERRIBLE  NICKNAME.
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE  FOR US TO HAVE MILLIONS AND  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE NO  HEALTH INSURANCE AND YET WHO CAN GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND GET  ENTIRELY FREE CARE FOR WHICH  THEY HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN THEY SHOW UP AT THE  HOSPITAL, THEY GET CARE, THEY  GET FREE CARE PAID FOR BY YOU  AND ME. IF THAT'S NOT A FORM OF  SOCIALISM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THE UNINSURED BEING  CARED FOR IN EMERGENCY ROOMS IS  IRRESPONSIBLE AND SOCIALIST AND  I AM TOTALLY COOL THAT. (LAUGHTER)  THAT'S HOW YOUR STATE WANTS TO  DEAL WITH IT. YOU SEE, WHATEVER HIS MISSTEPS  ARE AS A CANDIDATE BARACK OBAMA  IS SURGING IN THE POLLS BECAUSE  THE CLOSER WE GET TO THE ELECTION IT IS DUMBER MITT  ROMNEY APPEARS TO BE GETTING. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  HERE HE IS TOUTING HIS ECONOMIC  PLAN-- SETTLE DOWN. REALLY? IS THAT HOW YOU WANT TO WIN THIS  THING? (LAUGHTER)  THE OTHER GUY JUST TEARS HIS  A.C.L., IS THAT HOW YOU WANT TO  WIN? (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S ROMNEY TOUTING HIS  ECONOMIC PLAN AT THE START OF  THIS CAMPAIGN LAST YEAR.
MY ECONOMIC PLAN LAYS OUT HOW  I WILL ULTIMATELY GET GOVERNMENT  TO SHRINK, GROW OUR ECONOMY, BALANCE OUR BUDGET SO THAT  INVESTORS IN NEW JOBS AND  ENTERPRISES WILL HAVE CONFIDENCE  IN AMERICA. IT'S ABOUT 150 PAGES WITH 59  DIFFERENT POLICY IDEAS.
Jon: 59 POLICY IDEAS! 150 PAGES! 11 HERBS AND SPICES! 99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL! NOW HERE HE IS TOUTING HIS  ECONOMIC PLAN JUST EIGHT MONTHS  LATER.
IF WE WIN ON NOVEMBER 6, IT  WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM  ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS  COUNTRY. WE'LL SEE CAPITAL COME BACK AND  WE'LL SEE-- WITHOUT ACTUALLY  DOING ANYTHING, WE'LL ACTUALLY  GET A BOOST TO THE ECONOMY. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  THIS IS THE BUSINESSMAN  CANDIDATE! HE'S GONE FROM HAVING A 59 POINT  ECONOMIC PLAN TO MAGIC. (LAUGHTER)  DON'T WORRY, ALL THIS COUNTRY  NEEDS IS A LITTLE SHOT OF  VITAMIN MITT. (APPLAUSE)  IT'S LIKE HE READ "THE SECRET."  (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T NEED A PLAN, LET'S JUST  PUT POSITIVE VIBES DOWN THE  UNIVERSE. (LAUGHTER)  I SWEAR TO GOD, WHAT IS  HAPPENING TO ROMNEY? IT'S LIKE HE'S CHARLIE FROM  "FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON."  (LAUGHTER)  AND THE SERUM IS WEARING OFF. YES, READ A (BLEEP)ING BOOK! (LAUGHTER)  (APPLAUSE)  REALLY. YOU ALMOST-- YOU ALMOST HEARD  THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE  AUDIENCE THERE. THEY JUST GO "OH, I'M GOING TO  HAVE TO LOOK THAT UP. OH!"  (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S ROMNEY MAKING A DEFENSE  OF HIS LOW PERSONAL TAX RATE TWO  MONTHS AGO.
MY VIEW IS I HAVE PAID ALL  THE TAXES REQUIRED BY LAW. I DON'T PAY MORE THAN ARE  LEGALLY DUE. AND, FRANKLY, IF I HAD PAID MORE  THAN ARE LEGALLY DUE I DON'T  THINK I'D BE QUALIFIED TO BECOME  PRESIDENT.
Jon: I MEAN, HECK, IF I  OVERPAID MY TAXES WHO KNOWS WHAT  ELSE I'D OVERDO. INSTEAD OF PARDONING ONE TURKEY,  I MAY PARDON ALL THE TURKEYS. (LAUGHTER)  SO ANYHOW, PAYING MORE THAN THE  LEGALLY REQUIRED AMOUNT OF TAXES  WOULD DISQUALIFY ONE FROM THE  PRESIDENCY. THAT WAS TWO MONTHS AGO. FLASH TO THIS WEEKEND.
ACCORDING TO THAT 2011  RETURN, ROMNEY DONATED $4  MILLION TO CHARITY BUT ONLY  CLAIMED A DEDUCTION OF $2.25  MILLION. HE REDUCED HIS DEDUCTION AND IN  ESSENCE PAID MORE IN TAXES, THE  CAMPAIGN SAID, TO CONFORM TO HIS  EARLIER ESTIMATE THAT HE PAID A 13% RATE IN 2011.
Jon: OH, CHARLIE--  (LAUGHTER). OH, CHARLIE. OH, CHARLIE, YOU'RE FADING ON  US, CHARLIE! FIRST WE LOST ALGERNON AND NOW  YOU, CHARLIE? (LAUGHTER)  THE ELECTION'S AROUND THE CORNER  AND YOU CAN NO LONGER COMPLETE A  MAZE THAT JUST MONTHS EARLIER YOU DESIGNED YOURSELF. (LAUGHTER)  AND WHATEVER'S HAPPENING TO MITT  ROMNEY, IT IS HAPPENING FAST!
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME  PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU  SIMPLY TAKE FROM SOME AND GIVE  TO OTHERS WE'LL BE BETTER OFF. IT'S KNOWN AS REDISTRIBUTION. IT'S NEVER BEEN THE  CHARACTERISTIC OF AMERICA. A TAPE CAME OUT A COUPLE DAYS  AGO WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYING  YES, HE BELIEVES IN  REDISTRIBUTION. I DON'T!
Jon: OH, COME ON, CHARLIE. (LAUGHTER)  YOU CAN DO THIS, CHARLIE! REMEMBER? REDISTRIBUTION IS SOCIALISM,  CHARLIE! YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER! IT'S ONLY BEEN FOUR DAYS,  CHARLIE!
SO WHAT I DO IN MY MEDICARE  PLAN FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE COMING  ALONG IS SAY THIS "WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE HIGHER BENEFITS FOR LOW-INCOME PEOPLE AND LOWER  BENEFITS FOR HIGH-INCOME  PEOPLE."
Jon: THAT'S (BLEEP)ING  REDISTRIBUTION! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID! IT'S WHAT YOU JUST-- DON'T YOU  UNDERSTAND THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  DON'T YOU GET THAT? OH, RIGHT, YOU DON'T GET THAT. (LAUGHTER)  NOT ANYMORE. (LAUGHTER)  WE AIN'T TEACHING MITT ROMNEY,  MITT ROMNEY'S TEACHING US. (LAUGHTER)  SO THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA IS  THE LUCKIEST DUDE ON THE PLANET. ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE TO WONDER  WATCHING ROMNEY HOW THE HELL DID  THIS GUY EVEN GET THE  NOMINATION?
IT'S THREE AGENCIES OF  GOVERNMENT WHEN I GET THERE THAT  ARE GONE.
WE WILL HAVE THE FIRST  PERMANENT BASE ON THE MOON.
COMMERCE, EDUCATION, AND  THE-- UM, WHAT'S THE THIRD ONE  THERE?
HER LITTLE DAUGHTER TOOK  THAT-- TOOK THAT VACCINE, THAT  INJECTION, AND SHE SUFFERED FROM  MENTAL RETARDATION.
COMMERCE, EDUCATION AND--  UM-- THE UM-- UM--
OKAY, LIBYA. PRESIDENT OBAMA SUPPORTED-- THE  UPRISING, CORRECT?
PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTS TO--  ONCE SAID HE WANTS EVERYBODY IN  AMERICA TO GO TO COLLEGE. WHAT A SNOB!
OOPS.
Jon: OH, RIGHT. THAT CONCLUDES OUR SEGMENT "MITT  ROMNEY IS THE S.E.C.-LUCKIEST  DUDE ON THE PLANET."
