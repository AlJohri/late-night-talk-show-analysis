FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
WTHANK YOU FOR JOINING USW". TONIGHT. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. FROM THE FILM "DALLAS BUYERS CLUB" THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT. JARED LETO IS HERE. UNBELIEVABLE. LISTEN TO THIS, WE'RE CURRENTLY IN WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR. [LAUGHTER] WHY NOT? [LAUGHTER] FESTIVE TREES GO UP, CAROLERS BREAK OUT IN SONG. STARBUCKS SWITCHES OUT THE VAT OF PUMPKIN SPICE ADDITIVES FOR THE VAT OF PEPPERMINT ADDITIVES. IT'S A TIME TO CHERISH WHAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE COULD LOSE IT.
HOW MINORITIES ARE BECOMING THE MAJORITY AT THE COMMUNITYG POOL. HOW SHARIA LAW IS CHANGING EVERYTHING.
Jon: IT'S CHANGING EVERYTHING AND PROBABLY NOT FOR THE BETTER. WHILE I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHARIA LAW IS I KNOW IT'S MUSLIM-Y. AND IF FOX IS TALKING ABOUT IT IT'S THE KIND OF MUSLIM-Y THAT IS GOING TO DESTROY THE NATION.
A YMCA IN ST. PAUL IS STARTING A SWIM GROUP FOR MUSLIM GIRLS BUT SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS HAVE TO BE MADE TO KEEP WITH RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.
Jon: OH, MY GOD! SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS. EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. [ LAUGHTER ] WAIT, WHAT HAS CHANGED?
DURING THE ONE HOUR CLASS THE POOL IS SHUT DOWN, MEN'S LOCKER ROOM IS LOCKED AND FEMALE LIFEGUARDS ARE BROUGHT IN.
Jon: OH, MY GOD EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. DOGS WALK BABIES, DANCING MAKES YOU SAD. TEARS COME OUT OF YOUR EARS AND SNOT COMES OUT OF YOUR BUTT WHICH IS NOT HOW IT IS NOW, I CAN TELL YOU THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] ACTUALLY THOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING THAT HAS CHANGED BECAUSE OF SHARIA LAW IS ONE YMCA POOL'S SCHEDULE WHITE BOARD. IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING. I COULD SEE HOW THAT COULD BE TRAUMATIC. FIRST THEY CAME FOR OUR TUESDAY SYNCHRONIZED AQUA DANCE AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] BECAUSE I PREFER WATER EXERCISE WITH A POOL NOODLE. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO LIVE IN THAT WORLD OF PURE FEAR AND DESPAIR WHERE EVERY INCONSEQUENTIAL CHANGE IN WHAT WAS BECOMES A CHHARBINGER OF DYSTOPIAN POST AMERICA APOCALYPSE WHERE ONLY MUSLIMS CAN SWIM AND THE SIDEWALK GAME WHERE DECENT LAW ABIDING WHITE FOLK ARE RANDOMLY KNOCKED OUT HAS REPLACED BASEBALL AS OUR NATIONAL PASTTIME.
A NEW BATTLE IN THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
THE WAR ON CHRISTMAS.
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT IS SAYING FAITH BASED TUNES HAVE NO PLACE IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS SO EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENJOY THE SEASON WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF A FEW BAH HUMBUG BULLIES.
Jon: HOW CAN I ENJOY MY CHRISTMAS WHEN I KNOW SOMEWHERE A LITTLE JEWISH BOY ISN'T FORCED TO SING OH, LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM.
SARAH PALIN HAS A NEW BOOK OUT ABOUT THE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: I WAS HOPING FOR BLITZEN BUT SHE'LL DO.
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT A CHRISTIAN WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH AULD DEMONSTRATION OF SOMETHING FROM THE BIBLE FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT. COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE TO THEM IT MIGHT FEEL LIKE THE GOVERNMENT IS PICKING A RELIGION AND IT'S NOT THEIRS.
WELL, THERE'S THINGS WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT TO I GUESS LESSEN THAT OFFENSE. WE CAN DO THAT IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES. IN MY FAMILY WE HAVE THE MENORAH OUT THROUGH DECEMBER ON OUR KITCHEN TABLE. I WANT TO TEACH MY CHILDREN ABOUT THE JEWISH FAITH.
Jon: QUICK WORD TO THE PALIN KIDS, WHILE I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE, JEWS DON'T ACTUALLY JUST LEAVE A MENORAH OUT FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LIKE A KNICKKNACK IN A CURIO CASE. GOES IN THE WINDOW AND ONLY PUT IT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS. PALIN KIDS THIS IS NOT A MENORAH. NOW, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE WHO CAN DEFEND CHRISTMAS WITH A LITTLE MORE AUTHORITY. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE TAKEN ON THE ROLE OF PROTECTING THE FEDERAL HOLIDAY OF CHRISTMAS.
Jon: EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT IN ANY WAY THREATENED. I'LL BITE. TELL ME WHY THIS YEAR IT'S ESPECIALLY EGREGIOUS TO USE THE PHRASE HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
WHAT IS INTERESTING THIS YEAR IS HANUKKAH IS OVER ON THURSDAY SO THERE ARE NO MORE HOLIDAYS BETWEEN THEN AND CHRISTMAS DAY.
Jon: DAMN YOU, O'REILLY. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE BEEN CHECKMATED. WITHOUT HANUKKAH WE HAVE NO EXCUSE TO SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS PLURAL BECAUSE APPARENTLY YOU  CAN'T INCLUDE ANYTHING PAST CHRISTMAS LIKE KWANZAA AND NEW YEARS. BUT THAT MEANS UP UNTIL HANUKKAH YOU CAN ONLY SAY HAPPY HANUKKAH BUT WHAT THE (bleep) CARES BABOUT THAT. WHO ELSE IS PEEING ON YOUR YULE LOG THIS YEAR?
MACY'S A COMPANY I GENERALLY LIKE.
Jon: MACY'S ISN'T CHRISTMASSY ENOUGH FOR YOU? THIS MACY'S? THE ONE EMBLAZONED WITH A BEJEWELED BELIEVE SIGN THAT COULD BE SEEN FROM SPACE? [LAUGHTER] THE ONE THAT LOOKS AS THOUGH SOMEONE EJACULATED TINSEL ALL OVER IT? THAT MACY'S? [LAUGHTER] [  APPLAUSE  ] WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?
THIS YEAR THEY ARE TOUTING SANTA CLAUS WHO WILL HELP YOU QUOTE "WITH YOUR HOLIDAY WISH LIST." SO HERE IS MY QUESTION TO MACY'S WHAT HOLIDAY IS SANTA CELEBRATING?
Jon: THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. HE IS CELEBRATING THE FEAST OF ST. NICHOLAS WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND OCCURS EVERY DECEMBER 6. YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE EVERY OTHER HOLIDAY IS SUCKED INTO THE BLACK HOLE THAT IS CHRISTMAS. BY THE WAY, YOU ARE UPSET WITH A DEPARTMENT STORE BECAUSE IN THEIR EFFORT TO GET TO YOU BUY THE HELLO KITTY FIGURINE THEY ARE NOT INVOKING CHRIST'S NAME ENOUGH. I THOUGHT CHRISTIANS USED TO  COMPLAIN THAT THEIR HOLIDAY WAS GETTING TOO COMMERCIALIZED.
I LOVE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF CHRISTMAS BECAUSE IT SPREADS THE CHEER. IT'S THE MOST JOLLY HOLIDAY ON THE CALENDAR.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY. COMMERCIALIZATION IS SPREADING CHRISTMAS CHEER. I HAVE BEEN CONFUSED ABOUT THE HOLIDAY. I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT OPENING ONES HOME TO FRIENDS NOT OPENING A PRESENT AND RETURNING IT FOR CREDIT. IF THE TRUE SPIRIT OFR CHRISTMAS IS BEST SPREAD AND EXPRESSED THROUGH COMMERCIALISM AND MATERIALISM, THEN ANYONE WHO DENOUNCES THOSE THINGS IS WAGING WAR ON CHRISTMAS, SARAH PALIN, BILL O'REILLY MEET YOUR NEWEST NEMESIS.
TODAY POPE FRANCIS DENOUNCES  TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS AS UNFAIR TO THE POOR.
CALLING FOR CATHOLICS TO RESIST EXCESSIVE CAPITALISM AND MATERIALISM.
Jon: WHEN WILL THE POPE STOP HIS WAR ON CHRISTMAS? [LAUGHTER] [  APPLAUSE  ] WELL, I HOPE HIS MESSAGE IS HEARD AND SOME DAY MACY'S WILL TRULY HONOR THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
