Jon: WELCOME BACK. I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO YOU. WE'RE IN A RECESSION. I'M NOT GOING THE LIE TO YOU. BUT THERE'S ONE GROUP OF AMERICANS DOING QUITE WELL, CORPORATION, AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU CAN'T BE MORE LIKE THEM. SAMANTHA BEE HAS MORE.
THESE ARE THE SARNACOLAS. STACY IS A SCHOOLTEACHER. RODNEY WAS LAID OFF FROM WORK. LIKE SO MANY AMERICANS, THIS ECONOMY HAS LEFT THEM STRUGGLING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SEE  CORPORATIONS DOING THIS.
EXXON IS EXPECTED TO RING UP $114 BILLION IN REVENUE.
AND THIS.
G.E. PAID NO FEDERAL CORPORATE TAXES LAST YEAR.
AND THIS.
CITIGROUP GOT THE LARGEST BANK BAILOUT, $45 BILLION.
IT WOULD BE EASY FOR THE SARNACOLAS TO BE BITTER, BUT REMEMBER...
CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, MY FRIEND.
SO IF CORPORATIONS CAN BE PEOPLE, WHY CAN'T PEOPLE LIKE  THE SARNACOLAS BE CORPORATIONS? I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HIT SO HARD, BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET HIT EVEN HARDER WITH A HUGE CAN OF YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU'RE NO LONGER THE SARNACOLAS. NOW YOU'RE AMERIFAM. WE ASKED CORPORATE EXPERT ROBERT WISEMAN TO HELP US GIVE THIS FAMILY THE ADVANTAGES OF CORPORATEHOOD.
WELL, ONE OF THE FIRST THING THAT CORPORATIONS LIKE TO DO IS LAY OFF SOME OF THEIR WORKERS  AND SQUEEZE THE ONES LEFT BEHIND.
CISCO JUST RAISED PROFITS BY GETTING RID OF 7,000 WORKERS. LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME FOR US TO TRIM THE AMERIFAM. SO, CHILDREN, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELVES? DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?
RIDING MY BIKE.
ANDREW, DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?
PLAYING.
OKAY. I'M SORRY, ANDREW.
ALL RIGHT. ANDREW. YOU'RE FIRED.
YOU'RE FIRED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE. SO WE'VE STREAMLINED THE FAMILY, BUT WE'VE STILL GOT ALL THIS PESKY DEBT. NO PROBLEM.
ONE THING CORPORATIONS LIKE TO DO IS PUSH UP ALL THEIR DEBT ON OFF-THE-BOOK SUBSIDIARIES.
HAND NARCOTICS DO YOU DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOUR FAMILY?
YEAH.
GOOD, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW $83,000 IN DEBT AND I DON'T KNOW YOU. GOOD-BYE. OKAY.
HELLO? MOM? DAD?
ALL RIGHT.
HELLO?
IGNORE THAT. AS WE KNOW, THE AMERICAN WORKER HAS GOTTEN USED TO LIVING HIGH ON THE HOG. EATING AGAIN, RODNEY? THESE SNACKS HERE ISN'T DOING YOU ANY FAVORS.
PERHAPS AMERIFAM SHOULD OUTSOURCE TO FIND LABOR TO DO MORE FOR LESS.
ARE YOU WILLING TO DO TWICE THE VACUUMING FOR HALF THE SEX?
SI.
WHAT ABOUT NO SEX? NO SEXO CON STACY?
NO.
NEXT. NOW IT'S TIME TO START MAKING SOME MONEY. OH, MY GOSH, GET OUT OF MY WAY. CORPORATE LOBBYISTS GET BILLIONS OF GOVERNMENT DOLLARS FOR CORPORATIONS AND NO ONE IS  BETTER AT IT THAN WASHINGTON SUPER LOBBYIST TONY PODESTA WHOSE ALL-STAR CLIENT ROSTER INCLUDES B.P. IT SAYS HERE YOU REPRESENT B.P.
B.P. HAS BEEN A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY WORK HARD TO  PRODUCE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE... THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLY VALUE?
OH, MY GOD, THAT IS GREAT. YOU'RE HIRED.
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND.
OH, HOLD ON, WAIT. I WAS JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF A BOLT OF LIGHTNING WAS GOING TO COME DOWN FROM THE SKY AND  STRIKE US BOTH. BUT IT ISN'T. YAY.
YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR PRODUCT IS.
WE'RE A PEOPLE COMPANY.
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU?
WE HAVE A STAFF OF FOUR. TWO OF WHICH ARE CHILDREN.
IS IT A FAMILY?
OKAY. IT'S FAMILY, OKAY. CAN YOU HELP US?
NO.
I GUESS AMERIFAM'S NOT TOO BIG TO FAIL, SO UNLESS THEY'RE  GOING TO EXPAND LIKE THE DUGGERS, THEY NEED TO EMPLOY ONE LAST CORPORATE STRATEGY, RELOCATE TO AN OFF-SHORE TAX HAVEN. NOW THAT YOU'RE FLUSH WITH CASH, IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. YOU SPEAK MALDIVIAN, RIGHT? DOESN'T MATTER.
THIS DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.
YEAH, FAIR IS FOR SUCKERS. YOU'RE A CORPORATION NOW. BYE, STACY, BYE, RODNEY. SEE YOU AT THE AIRPORT. ANOTHER FAMILY SAVED. IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER THAT CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE, BUT NEVER FORGET THAT PEOPLE CAN BE  CORPORATIONS TOO.
HELLO? I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM.
Jon: SAMANTHA
