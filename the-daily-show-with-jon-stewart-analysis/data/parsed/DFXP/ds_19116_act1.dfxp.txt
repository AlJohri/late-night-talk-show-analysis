FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART."
Jon: HI. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SEBASTIAN JUNGER. HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE NEW DOCUMENTARY "KORENGAL," AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. IT'S THE FOLLOW UP TO "RESTREPO," WHICH YOU ALL REMEMBER. BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW ABOUT THE V.A. BACKLOG AND HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISED TO FIX IT BACK THERE IN, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, OT 8. AND HOW BEFORE THAT, GEORGE BUSH HAD PROMISED TO FIX IT. AND BEFORE THAT, WELL I GUESS IT COULD BE SUMMED UP BY HARRY S. TRUMAN, HARRY S. TRUMAN WHO SAID IN 1945, THIS IS TRUE, FIVE WEEKS AFTER HE TOOK OVER FOR FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, WHO HAD DIED OF A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE AFTER HE TRIED TO WRAP HIS MIND AROUND THE V.A. F.D.R., POLIO, NO PROBLEM. DEPRESSION, NO PROBLEM. HITLER, TOJO, NO PROBLEM. THE V.A.? ANYWAY, AS HARRY TRUMAN SAID, "THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION WILL BE MODERNIZED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BUT I CAN'T DO IT IMMEDIATELY." [LAUGHTER] TRUMAN! THE GUY WHO WAS ABLE TO HARNESS THE POWER OF THE ATOM. THE GUY WITH WHOM THE BUCK STOPS COULDN'T MAKE A DENT IN THE V.A. WELL, THE V.A.'S GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME. GUESS WHAT, FACELESS BUREAUCRACY? YOU JUST STEPPED IN [BLEEPED] CREEK WITHOUT A CAN OF WHOOP ASS. [LAUGHTER] GOT TO GET BETTER AT METAPHORS. BECAUSE ALL YOUR SHENANIGANS ATTRACTED SOME WHAT I THINK YOU'LL FIND IS UNWANTED ATTENTION.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE HOLDING A RARE NIGHTTIME HEARING TO TACKLE ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS TO EVER HIT THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.
Jon: OH [BLEEPED], YOU'RE IN TROUBLE NOW, MOTHER [BLEEPED]. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] CONGRESS IS HOLDING A HEARING ON YOUR ASS. AND NOT JUST HEARING, A NIGHT HEARING. CONGRESS AFTER DARK. [LAUGHTER] WHEN YOUR TYPICAL DO-NOTHING, BUMBLING CONGRESS TRANSFORMS INTO BAT-CONGRESS. I'M BAT-CONGRESS. TO THE LOW APPROVAL RATING MOBILE.
A LOT OF THE EQUIPMENT, THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE VETERANS HAVE IS OUTDATED. COULD THAT AFFECT PART OF THE SCHEDULING PROBLEMS?
Jon: HMM. WHAT AN APT NON-GRANDSTANDY QUESTION, DELIVERED IN A SUBDUED MANNER. INTERESTING. OBVIOUSLY TECHNOLOGY CHANGES RAPIDLY. THE SYSTEMS ARE PROBABLY SLIGHTLY OUT OF DATE THERE. THAT COULD HAVE AN EFFECT. PERHAPS THE V.A.'S LAPTOPS AND iPAD ARE STILL RUNNING ON PANTHER WHEN THEY SHOULD BE RUNNING ON O.S. MAVERICK. ANSWER THE QUESTION.
OUR SCHEDULING SYSTEM SCHEDULED ITS FIRST APPOINTMENT IN APRIL OF 1985. IT HAS NOT CHANGED IN ANY APPRECIABLE MANNER SINCE THAT DATE. [AUDIENCE REACTS] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, IS THE V.A. REPRESENTED BY ONE OF THE UNDEAD? SECOND OF ALL... [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING IN A ROBOTIC VOICE]: IT HAS NOT CHANGED. IT STILL WANTS BRAINS. BUT SERIOUSLY THOUGH, 1985? YOU'RE RUNNING O.S. TANDY1000. YOUR SYSTEM CAN'T PROCESS CLAIMS, BUT IT CAN PRINT AN ALL-TEXT PICTURE OF SNOOPY. 1985? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HAVE YOU EVER SAW THE MOVIE "THE NET" ON LATE-NIGHT CABLE AND LAUGHED OUT LOUD ALONE ABOUT HOW OUTDATED THE TECHNOLOGY SEEMS?
THIS WAS FALSE ALARM. O.
YES. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S TEN YEARS MORE ADVANCED THAN WHAT THE V.A. IS CURRENTLY USING. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I MEAN, THAT'S POW. WHAT? LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION: WHERE'S THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ON THIS? DOES THE V.A. HAVE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL, OR IS IT JUST A PUMPKIN IN HAT? COME ON! ISSUE A REPORT.
SINCE 2005, THE O.I.G. HAS ISSUED 18 REPORTS THAT IDENTIFIED AT BOTH THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL DEFICIENCIES IN SCHEDULING RESULTING IN LENGTHY WAIT TIMES AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PATIENT CARE.
Jon: OH. THAT'S TWO REPORTS A YEAR ON THE PROBLEM. CONGRESS, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ON THAT?
MR. GRIFFIN? SIR, IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU STATED THAT THE O.I.G. HAS ISSUED 18 REPORTS THAT IDENTIFY DEFICIENCIES IN SCHEDULING WITHIN THE V.A. SINCE 2005. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED WITHIN YOUR REPORTS?
Jon: OH, ELABORATE ON THEM. WELL, THERE'S 18 OF THEM. IT SOUNDS PRETTY [BLEEPED] ELABORATE. I UMM, SIR, I KNOW YOU'VE SENT THE REPORTS TO CONGRESS, AND I'M IN CONGRESS, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU. [WHISPERING]: I CAN'T READ. I'M SO ASHAMED. WHENEVER I GO OUT THE EAT, I HAVE TO GO TO DENNY'S BECAUSE I HAVE TO POINT TO THE PICTURES. [LAUGHTER] IT'S JUST GRAND SLAM AFTER GRAND SLAM.
DID THOSE I.G. REPORTS NEVER MAKE IT TO YOU?
IN RESPONSE TO THAT G.A.O. REPORT, WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT HOW WE COMPUTED THE WAIT TIMES FOR VETERANS WHO ARE NEW TO A CLINIC.
CAN YOU SAY THAT TODAY THAT'S FAILURE? WHAT YOU GUYS DID AT AN INTERMEDIARY LEVEL WAS FAILURE.
I WOULD SAY WE DID NOT KNOW AT THAT POINT IN TIME, CONGRESSWOMAN, THE NATURE AND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.
Jon: [WHISPERING]: I'M GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY. IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MESS IS BATTED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE V.A. PERHAPS USING TECHNOLOGY THE V.A. WOULD BE COMFORTABLE OPERATING. OH, HERE GO. I READ THE REPORT. AND DIDN'T. PERHAPS YOU CAN READ THE REPORT. AND OH, MAYBE IF WE ALL READ THE REPORTS AND THEN WE CAN GO THROUGH. BUT CONGRESS IS REALLY THE ISSUE. [LAUGHTER] [BEEP] I USED TO PLAY THAT FOR HOURS. [BEEP] CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT SOME -- [LAUGHTER] CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO USE THAT DEATH DRONE N.S.A. TECHNOLOGY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES AT THE V.A.? WHAT'S CAPTAIN AMERICA DOING WHEN HE'S NOT FIGHTING? CAN HE HELP? THIS GUY, RIGHT HERE, BOOM. JUST GIVE HIM AN AMERICAN-THEMED CLIPBOARD OR AN iPAD AND LET HIM AT THE BACKLOG.
MEN, YOUR WAIT TIMES ARE OVER. I'M TAKING YOU ALL TO SEE DOCTORS.
THEY SAID THERE WERE NO AVAILABLE APPOINTMENTS FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
WELL, THERE'S A NEW UNDER SECRETARY OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT IN TOWN.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET MEDICINE. REGULAR HEALTH CHECK-UPS HERE I COME. GO TO HELL, BACKLOG!
Jon: REFORM! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
