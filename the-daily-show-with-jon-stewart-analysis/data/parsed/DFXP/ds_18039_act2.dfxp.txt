Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW. LISTEN. AS YOU MAY RECALL, A COUPLE  MONTHS AGO AMERICA WAS HIT BY  TWO MAJOR DISASTERS. ONE OF THEM NATURAL, HURRICANE  SANDY AND ONE OF THEM SOMEWHAT  MAN MADE THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THE SECOND OF THOSE DISASTERS  HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN  UP THE FIRST ONE
THE $60 BILLION HURRICANE  SANDY AID PACKAGE. THE HOUSE ADJOURNED LAST NIGHT  WITHOUT VOTING ON IT
Jon: I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S BEEN A LONG SESSION. HOUSE REPUBLICANS PROBABLY  WANTED TO GET HOME. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WANTED TO GET  BACK TO THEIR HOMES? THE PEOPLE WHOSE HOMES GOT SWEPT  AWAY BY HURRICANE SANDY. YES, THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS... (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ... SOMEHOW NEGLECTED TO VOTE  FOR $60 BILLION IN HURRICANE  AID. A MOVE SO RIDICULOUS, EVEN THEIR  OWN MEMBERS WERE GOING AFTER  THEM
THERE'S ONLY ONE GROUP TO  BLAME FOR THE CONTINUED  SUFFERING OF THESE INNOCENT VICTIMS: THE HOUSE MAJORITY AND  THEIR SPEAKER, JOHN BOEHNER
I'M SAYING RIGHT NOW ANYONE  FROM NEW YORK TO NEW JERSEY WHO  CONTRIBUTES ONE PENNY TO CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS IS OUT  OF THEIR MINDS BECAUSE WHAT THEY  DID WAS TO STAB IN THE BACK NEW YORKERS AND NEW JERSEYIANS WITH  ABSOLUTE DISGRACE
Jon: WOW, WHEN PETER KING IS  CALLING YOU A DISGRACE. I'LL SAY THIS. TO KRISTIE AND KING, BY THE END  OF THE WEEK...
THE HOUSE VOTED TO APPROVE  MORE THAN $9 BILLION FOR FLOOD  INSURANCE CLAIMS FROM HURRICANE SANDY
Jon: SEE... WAIT A MINUTE. YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. $9 BILLION WHICH IS, AS YOU MAY  HAVE NOTICED, NOT THE $60  BILLION THAT THE SENATE PASSED. THE HOUSE DECIDED TO SEPARATE  THE $9.7 BILLION IN FLOOD  INSURANCE FROM THE $61 BILLION WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE ON  NEXT WEEK. BECAUSE WHAT'S ANOTHER WEEK? ONE MORE THING
67 REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST  $9.7 BILLION IN AID FOR VICTIMS  OF SUPER STORM SANDY
Jon: THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE DOWN THE  MIDDLE BLACK-AND-WHITE  CUT-AND-DRIED WARM CUP OF WHAT WOULD JESUS OR ANY OTHER HUMAN  BEING THAT ISN'T AN [BLEEP] DO? AND YOU BLEW IT. YOU BLEW IT. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   WHAT POSSIBLE REASON... WHAT  POSSIBLE REASON COULD YOU HAVE FOR VOTING AGAINST AID TO  HURRICANE VICTIMS BY WAY OF A  FLOOD REIMBURSEMENT FUND? WHAT DID THE EASTERN SEABOARD  EVER DO TO ANY OF YOU?
PAUL RYAN JOINS 66 OTHER  REPUBLICANS IN VOTING AGAINST  IT.
Jon: I KNOW WHAT THE EASTERN  SEABOARD DID TO HIM. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   BUT WHAT IS HIS STATED REASON?
IN A STATEMENT HE SAID QUOTE  UNFORTUNATELY WASHINGTON'S  LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE FAILS ON BOTH COUNTS. IT ROVES TO DISTINGUISH OR EVEN  PRIORITIZE DISASTER RELIEF OVER  PORK BARREL SPENDING.
Jon: YES, PORK BARREL  SPENDING. I KNOW IT SEEMS ANATHEMA TO PAUL  RYAN WHO FAVORS LEAN PROTEIN AND  FISH. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS  BILL AND SEE WHAT KIND OF PORK  CONGRESS SNUCK INTO THIS. LET ME GET IT FOR YOU. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. LET ME SEE IF I CAN JUST GET  THIS GIANT PORK... IT'S ONE [BLEEP] PAGE. IT'S TWO PARAGRAPHS THAT ADD  $9.7 BILLION TO THE NATIONAL  FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM AND NOTHING ELSE. THERE'S AS MUCH PORK IN HERE AS  IN THE MINI-FRIDGE OF THE BREAK  ROOM AT PETA. THERE'S NO PORK IN THIS THING. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE NICE,  MODERATE PAUL RYAN? YOU KNOW, THIS GUY.
THE TRUTH IS THERE HAS TO BE  A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO. GOVERNMENT MUST ACT FOR THE  COMMON GOOD WHILE LEAVING  PRIVATE GROUPS FREE TO DO THE WORK THAT ONLY THEY CAN DO
Jon: PRIVATE GROUPS THEY KEPT  UP THEIR HALF OF THE DEAL. THEY RAISED LIKE $400 MILLION. REMEMBER THIS? THE WHO? THE STONES, BON JOVI HALF THE  SURVIVING VIEW. IT WAS SO SPRINGSTEEN WAS THE  OPENING UP. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALLED KANYE  AT THIS CONCERT? INTERMISSION. BY THE WAY, YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE  RULES OF THE GAME IN THE MIDDLE  OF A DISASTER. IF YOU'RE PART OF A COUNTRY THAT  GETS SHELLACKED BY A COUNTRY, WE  KICK IN A COUPLE OF SHE CANALS. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THIS  WHOLE PRINCIPLED IDEOLOGY THING  THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT THERE IS BULL [BLEEP] ANYWAY. EXHIBIT-A. MISSISSIPPI'S HONORABLE  MR. PALAZZO
HE VOTED NO TO HELP THE  VICTIMS OF HURRICANE SANDY.
Jon: I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE  THINKING. THE INVENTOR OF PALAZZO PANTS? A.K.A. JOHN STEWART'S FAT DAY  PANTS? BUT NO. HE IS THE GUY WHO JUST LAST YEAR  WAS STILL ASKING FOR, YOU  GUESSED IT, FUNDING OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM  FOR A STORM THAT TOOK PLACE IN  HIS AREA OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO.
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN  MISSISSIPPI ARE STILL DEALING  WITH THE EFFECTS OF HURRICANE  KATRINA. THEY DEPEND ON THE NATIONAL  FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.
Jon: OH, THE FLOOD INSURANCE  PROGRAM YOU VETOED SPENDING  MONEY TO REIMBURSE. HERE'S A THOUGHT. LET'S PRETEND INSTEAD OF YOUR  CONSTITUENTS IN MISSISSIPPI,  IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S CONSTITUENTS IN NEW YORK. INSTEAD OF SEVEN YEARS LATER  IT'S TWO MONTHS LATER. INSTEAD OF BEING AN [BLEEP],  YOU. LOOK, REPUBLICANS, I GUESS THAT  YOU'RE THE PARTY OF LIMITED  GOVERNMENT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OBAMA  CARE HERE. THIS WAS TWO PARAGRAPHS GIVING  AID TO PEOPLE IN NEED. YOU GUYS COULDN'T BRING YOURSELF  TO VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE OF SOME  STUPID PRINCIPLE YOU YOURSELVES ONLY OCCASIONALLY LIVE BY. HERE'S THE THING. IF YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR THEM, I'M  NOT SAYING YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE  FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS FACING OUR COUNTRY BUT YOU SURE ARE MAKING  THEM
