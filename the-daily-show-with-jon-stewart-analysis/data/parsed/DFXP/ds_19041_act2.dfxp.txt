[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT GETTING A LONG BREAK IS YOU GET A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE NEWS CYCLE BECAUSE IT THAT LETS THAT RAGE TUMOR IN MY BRAIN SHRINK SLIGHTLY. I JUST HOPE I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING BIG WHILE WE WERE GONE.
THERE'S A DEVELOPMENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE BATTLE AGAINST NUNS.
Jon: WHAT? WHOA! WAIT, WHAT THE -- WHO? WHAT? THE WHITE HOUSE IS FIGHTING NUNS? BASTARDOS. UNLESS THESE MUST BE TERRIBLE NUNS FOR OUR EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO RAISE THE FLAG OF WAR.
THE HOSPICE FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL.
Jon: THOSE ARE THE MOST ADORABLE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. THE NUNS STRUMMING GUITARS AND FEEDING PEOPLE AND TEACHING THAT MAN TO PLAY THE ACCORDIAN. WHY ARE WE FIGHTING THOSE NUNS? WE SHOULD BE FIGHTING THOSE NUNS. I DON'T LIKE THAT NUN. STOP HITTING HER. OH, THE NUNS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY IS OBAMA GOING AFTER THE SWEET NICE MUSICAL NUNS.
A KEY PROVISION OF THE OBAMACARE LAW. IT'S THE LAW SO CALLED CONTRACEPTION MANDATE.
Jon: WHY ARE WE MAKING THE NUNS USE CONTRACEPTION? I'M TAKING A BOLD STANCE. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE FORCING THE NUNS TO HAVE SEX IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S -- CONTRACEPTION IS FOR THE PEOPLE THE NUNS EMPLOY AND THE NUNS DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THAT CONTRACEPTION INSURANCE SO WE DON'T MAKE THEM HAVE SEX. [ LAUGHTER ] STAY CLASSY SAN DIEGO. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION POINTS TO A COMPROMISE IN THE LAW THAT WOULD ALLOW THE NUNS TO SIGN A CERTIFICATION OPTING OUT OF THE CONTRACEPTION REQUIREMENT.
Jon: THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT >A FORM AND THEY DON'T PAY FOR THE CONTRACEPTION INSURANCE. THAT IS PAID FOR BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HELL ANYWAY.
THE NUNS SAY IT VIOLATES THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS TO SIGN AND ADMIT TO THIS PERMISSION SLIP THAT WOULD GIVE A THIRD PARTY THE ABILITY TO HANDOUT CONTRACEPTION ON THEIR BEHALF.
Jon: YOU DON'T WANT TO SIGN THE FORM BECAUSE THAT ENABLES EMPLOYEES TO GET CONTRACEPTION. YOU DO REALIZE YOU GIVE THEM PAPER ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET CONTRACEPTION, RIGHT? IT'S CALLED MONEY. AND TO THE NUNS, AWR ADORABLE, YOU ARE DOING NICE WORK BUT IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN OUR MUGGLE WORLD -- [LAUGHTER] -- YOU'LL SOON REALIZE WE CANNOT CONTROL OUR URGES. [ LAUGHTER ] I GUARANTEE YOUR WORKERS ARE ALREADY USING THIS MONEY TO BUY ALL KINDS OF OBJECTIONABLE ITEMS, BOOZE, CIGARETTES, MULTICOLORED CLOTHING. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE WORKS FOR YOU DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T GET TO CONTROL THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. YOU DON'T WANT MY ADVICE. THAT'S MAYBE WHY WE SHOULD CALL SOMEONE IN WITH THE WISDOM OF A FORMER PASTOR AND GRAVITAS OF A FAILED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
I THINK OUR FOUNDERS WOULD BE STUNNED IF THEY EVER THOUGHT THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PUSH THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR INTO PROVIDING SOME TYPE OF CONTRACEPTION COVERAGE.
Jon: THE FOUNDERS WOULD BE STUNNED EXCEPT MAYBE BEN FRANKLIN THAT WOULD SAY (bleep) ELECTRICITY THIS CONTRACEPTION IS THE GREATEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD OF. WHAT DO YOU THINK TJ? AND JEFFERSON WOULD SAY THIS COULD UNCOMPLICATE MY LEGACY QUITE NICELY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
