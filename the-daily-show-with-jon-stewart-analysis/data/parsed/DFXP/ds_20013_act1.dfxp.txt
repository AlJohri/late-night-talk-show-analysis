Jon: THANK YOU! WELCOME TO THE SHOW! THANK YOU! THANK YOU SO MUCH! WELCOME!  WELCOME TO THE SHOW! THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOW, WHAT AN HONOR TO BE HERE! IN AUSTIN, TEXAS! THE ONLY OPEN CARRY EBOLA STATE IN THE UNION. WE ARE THRILLED TO BE HERE IN AUSTIN'S OWN ZACH THEATRE. AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US. WE HAVE A NICE WEEK PLANNED. WE'RE HEADING INTO NEXT WEEK'S MID-TERM ELECTIONS, OUR GUEST TONIGHT, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE WENDY DAVIS, SHE WILL BE JOINING US. [ Cheering and Applause ] BUT REALLY, BUT REALLY THE BIG STORY. THE COUNTRY CONTINUES ITS PERVERSE OBSESSION WITH A VIRUS THAT NONE OF US WHO HAS NOT HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH AN EBOLA PATIENT HAS GOTTEN. OUR FULL TEAM COVERAGE STARTS WITH SAMANTHA BEE. SAMANTHA BEE IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED IN DALLAS, TEXAS. [ Cheering and Applause ]
THANK YOU. YES.
Jon: SAM, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SAM, I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU, CURRENTLY THERE'S NO ACTIVE EBOLA CASES, HOW DID DALLAS FINALLY GET ON TOP OF THINGS?
WELL, JON, DALLAS OFFICIALS TRIED EVERY TEXAS SOLUTION THEY COULD THINK OF. THEY SHOT AT EBOLA. THEY GAVE IT THE DEATH PENALTY. THEY PRAYED FOR THE VIRUS. BUT IN A WAY THAT THE VIRUS FOUND PATRONIZING, AND THAT MADE IT FEEL BAD ABOUT ITSELF. TURNS OUT, ALL THEY REALLY NEEDED TO DO WAS JUST GET THEIR [BLEEP] TOGETHER.
Jon: SO RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS YOU'VE HEARD DALLAS IS OKAY.
WELL, RELATIVELY OKAY. BECAUSE, WELL, THERE'S NO MORE EBOLA DALLAS IS STILL A STEAMING CONCRETE WASTELAND OF TRAFFIC JAMS, BIG HAIR AND STUPID BELT BUCKLES, AM I RIGHT? PEOPLE WHO CAN HEAR ME IN AUSTIN?
Jon: OF COURSE RIGHT NOW NEW YORK CITY IS DEALING WITH ITS FIRST CASE OF EBOLA. FOR MORE WE'RE GOING OUT TO AASIF MANDVI IN NEW YORK. AASIF MANDVI. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WHAT'S, WHAT'S -- IN NEW YORK -- WHAT'S THE STORY, AASIF?
THE STORY, JON? Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
THE STORY IS WHEN I SAID I WOULD STAY HERE IN NEW YORK EBOLA WAS IN TEXAS. [ Applause ] BUT NOW THAT EVERYONE BUT ME IS IN TEXAS, EBOLA IS IN NEW YORK!
Jon: SO YOU ARE SAYING --
WHAT I'M SAYING IS (BLEEP) (BLEEP) (BLEEP) --
Jon: THANK YOU, AASIF. VERY NICE. NOW OBVIOUSLY, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE AASIF BACK. WE ALSO, WE WANTED TO CHECK IN ON AUSTIN'S OWN EBOLA PREPARATIONS. JESSICA WILLIAMS IS AT THE CAPITOL CITY'S TOP INFECTIOUS DISEASE FACILITY. AT LEAST -- I'M SORRY, JESSICA, AT LEAST I THINK YOU'RE THERE.
OH YEAH, THAT'S WHERE I AM. BUT LIKE EVERY OTHER PLACE IN AUSTIN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE WARD IS ALSO AN ESPRESSO BAR AND A BIKE CO-OP.
Jon: JESSICA, BASED ON YOUR -- BECAUSE [ Cheering and Applause ] I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND REPORTING COULD EBOLA SPREAD TO AUSTIN?
FROM DALLAS? OH, YEAH, JON. AUSTIN IS GOING TO PICK UP SOMETHING AFTER DALLAS. NO, JON, NO. AUSTIN SETS THE TRENDS, AND DALLAS FINDS OUT ABOUT THEM FIVE YEARS LATER. [ Cheering and Applause ]
Jon: ALL RIGHT. IN YOUR MIND THERE'S NO WAY EBOLA MAKES IT TO AUSTIN?
DOESN'T NEED TO. JON, AUSTIN IS ALREADY BREWING ITS OWN LOCALLY SOURCED, SMALL BATCH, FAIR TRADE, ORGANIC, CAGE FREE, FARM TO TABLE EBOLA. KEEP EBOLA WEIRD!
OH, JON! JON!
Jon: OH MY GOD, WHAT'S THAT?
JON! HELP ME, JON!
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER, WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG, JORDAN?
WHAT DO YOU THINK WRONG? I GOT THE EBOLA!
Jon: WHAT? ARE YOU SURE?
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE? EVER SINCE I GOT TO AUSTIN I'VE HAD NAUSEA, FEVER, SWEATING PROFUSELY, MY INTESTINES, THEY FEEL LIKE THE INSIDE VOLCANO.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN, JORDAN. CALM DOWN. RETRACE YOUR STEPS. SINCE YOU GOT TO AUSTIN WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WE NEED THIS --
WELL, RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW, I WAS EATING BRISKET AT A FOOD TRUCK.
Jon: OKAY. OKAY.
BEFORE THAT I HAD THIS AMAZING PULLED PORK ALSO FROM A TRUCK. THIS MORNING WAS BREAKFAST RIBS FROM THE TRUNK OF A TESLA. AND LAST NIGHT AT THE AIRPORT WHEN I STEPPED OFF THE PLANE THEY ADORNED ME WITH THIS TRADITIONAL BARBECUE LEI.
Jon: JORDAN, JORDAN, I THINK I KNOW WHAT IS WRONG. JORDAN, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE EBOLA I THINK YOU HAVE THE MEAT SWEATS. I THINK YOU'VE BEEN EATING --
MAYBE OR MAYBE I'M JUST, MAYBE I'M NOT EATING ENOUGH MEAT.
Jon: NO, JORDAN, DON'T DO THAT. THAT'S NOT.
OH MAN, DUDE. THAT LOOKS SO GOOD.
Jon: JESSICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN JORDAN'S QUARANTINE, YOU'RE IN HIS QUARANTINE ZONE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M CHOWING BARBECUE, JON. DUH.
OH MY GOD, WHAT IS GOING ON. I CAN SMELL THOSE LITTLE BASTARDS ALL THE WAY FROM DALLAS.
Jon: NO, YOU'RE IN DALLAS. HOW DID YOU GET THERE FROM -- NO! ALL RIGHT. JORDAN, JESSICA, SAMANTHA, AASIF, EVERYONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
