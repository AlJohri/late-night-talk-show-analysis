Jon: WELCOME BACK. SHE'S THE YOUNGEST PERSON EVER TO BE NOMINATED FOR A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. HER BOOK IS CALLED I AM MALALA. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MALALA YOUSAFZAI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NICE TO SEE YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME.
Jon: IT'S AN HONOR FOR US. I KNOW ME. THIS IS -- BY THE WAY, WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT BEFORE THE SHOW. NOTHING FEELS BETTER THAN MAKING YOU LAUGH. I WILL SAY THAT. I ENJOYED THAT VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I AM MALALA. IT'S HONESTLY HUMBLING TO MEET YOU. YOU ARE 16. WHERE DID YOUR LOVE FOR EDUCATION COME FROM?
WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AND THIS IS THE PART OF OUR HUMAN NATURE THAT WE DON'T LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S SNATCHED FROM OUR HANDS. AND WHEN -- IN PAKISTAN WHEN WE WERE STOPPED FROM GOING TO SCHOOL AT THAT TIME I REALIZED THAT EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND EDUCATION IS A POWER FOR WOMEN. AND THAT'S WHY THE TERRORISTS ARE AFRAID OF EDUCATION. THEY DON'T WANT WOMEN TO GET EDUCATION BECAUSE WOMEN WILL BECOME MORE POWERFUL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: EXACTLY RIGHT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHEN DID THE -- WHEN DID THE TALIBAN COME TO SWAT VALLEY? BECAUSE BEFORE THEN YOU DESCRIBE IT AS A PARADISE OF SORTS.
A TALIBAN CAME IN 2004 BUT AT THAT TIME THEY WERE QUITE GOOD. THEY DID NOT SHOW THE TERRORISM AND THEY DID NOT BLAST ANY SCHOOL AT THAT TIME. THEY STARTED WITH THE REAL TERRORISM IN 2007 THEY BLASTED MORE THAN 400 SCHOOLS IN SWAT. THEY SLAUGHTERED PEOPLE AND IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY 2009, THEY USED TO SLAUGHTER EVEN TWO THREE PEOPLE EVERY NIGHT AND THEY FLOGGED THEM AND WE HAVE SEEN THE BARBARIC SITUATION OF THE 21ST CENTURY. AND WE'VE SEEN LIKE THE CRUELTY AND WE'VE SEEN HARSH DAYS IN OUR LIFE. AND THOSE ARE REGARDED AS THE DARKEST DAYS OF OUR LIFE. IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR US AT THAT TIME.
Jon: YOU DESCRIBE IN THE BOOK STILL, NO MATTER WHAT, THEY TOOK THE SIGNS OFF THE SCHOOLS. THEY  WENT UNDERGROUND BUT THEY CONTINUED IN THE FACE OF -- YOU SPOKE OUT PUBLICLY AGAINST THE TALIBAN. WHAT GAVE YOU THE COURAGE TO CONTINUE THIS?
YOU KNOW, MY FATHER WAS A GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ME BECAUSE HE SPOKE OUT FOR WOMENS' RIGHTS, FOR GIRLS' EDUCATION. AT THAT TIME I SAID WHY SHOULD I WAIT FOR SOMEONE ELSE? WHY SHOULD I BE LOOKING TO THE GOVERNMENT, TO THE ARMY, THAT THEY WOULD HELP US? WHY DON'T I RAISE MY VOICE? WHY DON'T WE SPEAK FOR OUR RIGHTS? I STARTED WRITING DIARY. I SPOKE ON EVERY MEDIA CHANNEL I COULD. I RAISE MY VOICE IN EVERY PLATFORM I COULD. I SAID I NEED TO TELL THE WORLD WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SWAT AND I NEED TO TELL THE WORLD THAT SWAT IS SUFFERING FROM TERRORISM AND WE NEED TO FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.
Jon: WHEN DID YOU REALIZE THAT THE TALIBAN HAD MADE YOU A TARGET?
WHEN IN 2012 I WAS WITH MY FATHER AND SOMEONE CAME AND TOLD US HAVE YOU SEEN ON GOOGLE IF YOU SEARCH YOUR NAME THAT THE TALIBAN HAS THREATENED YOU. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. I SAID IT'S NOT TRUE. EVEN AFTER WHEN WE SAW IT I WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT MYSELF THAT MUCH I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY FATHER. WE THOUGHT THAT THE TALIBAN ARE NOT THAT MUCH CRUEL THAT THEY WOULD KILL A CHILD. I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THAT AND THINKING THE TALIB WOULD COME AND HE WOULD KILL ME. I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD YOU DO MALALA, I THOUGHT TAKE A SHOE AND HIT HIM. BUT I THOUGHT IF YOU HIT A TALIB WITH YOUR SHOE THEN THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE TALIB. YOU MUST NOT TREAT OTHERS WITH CRUELTY AND HARSHLY. YOU MUST FIGHT OTHERS BUT THROUGH PEACE, DIALOGUE AND EDUCATION. THEN I TELL HIM HOW IMPORTANT EDUCATION IS AND I EVEN WANT EDUCATION FOR YOUR CHILDREN AS WELL AND I WILL TELL HIM THAT'S I WANT TO TELL YOU NOW DO WHAT YOU WANT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW YOUR FATHER IS BACK STAGE [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I KNOW YOUR FATHER IS BACK STAGE AND HE'S VERY PROUD OF YOU. BUT WOULD HE BE MAD IF  I ADOPTED YOU? BECAUSE YOU SURE ARE SWELL. COULD YOU STICK AROUND? I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SWAT VALLEY AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE GROWING UP THERE AND HOW PEOPLE CAN GET INVOLVED THROUGH THE MALALA FUND AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS? DO YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME?
YES, YEAH, SURE.
Jon: I AM MALALA IS ON SHELVES NOW. VISIT TO THE MALALA FUND. MALALA YOUSAFZAI.
