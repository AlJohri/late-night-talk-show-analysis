[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS SAY  FILMMAKER HIS LATEST FILM IS  CALLED "THE HOUSE I LIVE IN."
WATCHING ARREST AFTER ARREST  I BEGAN TO SEAT DESTRUCTIVE  IMPACT ON DRUG LAWS NOT ONLY ON  THOSE THEY TARGET BUT ON THOSE WHO ENFORCE THEM AS WELL.
THE COP THAT MADE THAT CHEAP  DRUG ARREST HE IS GOING TO GET  PAID. HE GETS THE HOURS OF OVERTIME  FOR TAKING THE DRUGS DOWN TO  ECU. HE GETS PAID FOR PROCESSING THE  PRESIDENTER IN AT CENTRAL  BOOKING. HE'S PAID FOR SITTING BACK AT  HIS DESK FOR WRITING THE  PAPERWORK. HE DOES THAT 40, 50, 60 TIMES A  MONTH SO HIS BASE PAY IS MAYBE  ONLY HALF OF WHAT HE IS PAID AS  A POLICE OFFICER.
Jon: WOW. PLEASE WE PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW EUGENE JARECKI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CONGRATULATIONS, AGAIN, ON THE  FILM. IT'S INCREDIBLE. THE DRUG WAR HAS COST AMERICA  GREATLY.
YES.
Jon: BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE  WE HAVE BREAKING BAD. SO WOULD YOU SAY IN SOME WAYS  IT'S EVEN.
IT'S A WASH.
Jon: IT'S A WASH. DID YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE  EFFECTS OF THE DRUG WAR BEFORE  YOU EMBARKED ON THIS FILM?
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A DRUG  WAR. WHAT I SAW WAS THAT BLACK  AMERICANS DURING MY LIFETIME,  BLACK FRIENDS AND FAMILIES I  KNEW WERE SUFFERING. THEY WEREN'T KIND OF GETTING THE  RESULTS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS  MOVEMENT I THINK A LOT OF US  EXPECTED. SOMETHING WAS BLOCKING BLACK  PROGRESS. I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS ONLY OVER TIME THAT IT  HAS TO DO WITH HOW MANY BLACK  PEOPLE ARE IN JAIL. THEN WHY. I STARTED TO LEARN IT WAS THE  DRUG WAR WITH US FOR 40 YEARS  NOW. IT WAS PUTTING BLACK PEOPLE AWAY  BY CONTROLS AND HAVING A HUGE  IMPACT ON THAT COMMUNITY.
THE EASIEST ONE THAT SEEMS  LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO DIGEST IS THE  DIFFERENCE IN SENTENCING BETWEEN CRACK AND COCAINE.
IT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S THE ONE THAT I THINK  IS MAYBE THE MOST EASILY  DIGESTED.
SURE, WELL, PEOPLE MAY NOT  KNOW THIS HISTORICALLY CRACK HAS  BEEN PUNISHED 100 TIMES MORE  SEVERELY THAN POWDER COCAINE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE SAME  DRUG. OVER TIME EXPERTS CAME TO  CONGRESS AND SAID I'M A JUDGE  I'M TELLING YOU IT MAKES NO  SENSE IN THE LAW, MAKES NO SENSE IN SCIENCE AND IT'S A HUGE  IMPACT ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY  AFFECTED BY CRACK. IT'S A RACIST LAW. CONGRESS WOULDN'T HEAR IT. ONLY THIS PAST YEAR THEY SAID  BEAL DROP IT FROM 100-1 TO 18-1.
Jon: SO THEY ADMITTED IT  WAS ABSOLUTELY AN INJUSTICE AND  THEY WANT TO LEAVE IT AT KIND OF  AN INJUSTICE.
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE  MESSAGE WAS.
Jon: SURE THAT MAKES A LOT  OF SENSE.
OUR DRUG LAWS DON'T MAKE  SENSE A LOT OF TIME. THE WOMAN WHO IN FLORIDA, FOR  EXAMPLE, RECENTLY THOUGHT THAT  HER SERIALLY ABUSIVE HUSBAND WAS  GOING TO ABUSE HER AND FIRED A WARNING SHOT IN THE AIR. IN FLORIDA YOU GET 20 YEAR  MINIMUM FOR DISCHARGING A  FIREARM  ARM. IF SHE POINTED THE GUN AT HIM  AND KILLED HIM SHE GOT 15 YEARS.
Jon: UNLESS SHE SAID HE WAS  STANDING HER GROUND.
THE LAWS ARE LIKE LESS MONEY  RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER PEOPLE.
Jon: THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL  COMPLEX OR DRUG INDUSTRIAL  COMPLEX WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?
WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF  INDUSTRIALIZED MASS  INCARCERATION. WE'RE THE LARGEST JAILER IN THE  WORLD. 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE BEHIND BARS.
Jon: MORE THAN CHINA?
INDEED.
Jon: IN YOUR FACE CHINA! YOU MAY OWN OUR DEBT BUT NOBODY  INCARS -- OH, WAY. INCREDIBLE.
HOW DID WE GET THERE? A BEACON OF DEMOCRACY AND YET  WE'VE A GULAG NATION. THIS IS BECAUSE OF DRUG WAR. THE NONTRY LENT IN THIS COUNTRY  ARE PUT IN JAIL FOR LONGER  SENTENCES THAN THE VIOLENT. WHY?
Jon: IF YOU WATCH THE  DEBATE SAVE FOR RON PAUL OR  LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE, NOBODY  MENTIONS THE DRUG CAR, NOBODY MENTIONS THE TYPES OF SENTENCES  AND THE DISPARITY IN THEM. THERE WAS A DEBATE TONIGHT.
WE COULD TAKE A BET.
Jon: MAYBE FOR-A GRAM --
AFTERWARDS.
Jon: WE'RE WHITE GUYS. WE CAN GET AWAY WIT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, IT'S ASTONISHING.
IT HAS TO DO WITH AGAIN,  BUSINESS. THIS COUNTRY IS FINDING  EVERYWHERE WE LOOK WE'RE SEEING  PLACES WHERE THE EXTRAORDINARY  POWER OF CORPORATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE UNHOLY ALLIANCE  THEY HAVE WITH THOSE IN CONGRESS  IS DESTROYING --
Jon: WHAT WOULD BE THE  CORPORATE INTEREST IN ININCOURSE  RATING PEOPLE.
THERE ARE PRIVATE PRISON THAT  RELY FOR THEIR OWN VIEFERRAL ON  FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEM IT'S THE  PUBLIC SYSTEM WITH EMPLOYEES,  THE FOOD SERVICE, THE LAUNDRY  SYSTEM I WENT TO TRADE SHOWS WHERE I SAW PEOPLE WHO MAKE  THEIR ENTIRE LIFE'S WORK THAT  SELL YOU THE BETTER STUN GUN  THAT -- THAN THAT GUY'S STUN  GUN. THERE'S A COMMONALITY WHERE WE  RELY ON. THIS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE IN  THE POCKET OF IT.
Jon: YOU HAVE THIS  INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS TO BE  DISASSEMBLED. IT'S AN ACTIVE PROCESS AND WE'RE  NOT PRAY GOOD THAT. HOW DOES THAT ZMUR.
WE'VE HAD SYSTEMS BEFORE WE  HAD TO STOP. WE HAD TO STOP SLAVERY. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN EVERY  REVOLUTION BRITT HAPPENED YOU  SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. AND THEN IT DOES HAPPEN AND  PEOPLE SAY IT WAS INHE HAVE HAVE  ITABLE. YOU SEE PEOPLE ACROSS THE  SPECTRUM WEIGHING. IN PAT ROBERTSON SPOKE OUT  AGAINST THE DRUG WAR. CHRIS CHRISTIE. PEOPLE ONL THE LEFT SIDE OF THE  AISLE AL SHARPTON, RUSSELL  SIMMONS THEY THOUGHT THAT FOR A  LONG TIME. HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE GROVER  NORQUIST AND RUSSELL SIMMONS ON  THE SAME SIDE OF ANY ISSUE? IT'S VULNERABLE BECAUSE IT'S  FAILED ON THE NUMBER AND IMMORAL  AND HURTING PEOPLE SO VASTLY.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE  MINUTES  MINUTES TO STICK AROUND?
YES.
Jon: "THE HOUSE I LIVE IN."  EUGENE JARECKI. IT'S IN
