SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MONEY IN POLITICS, THERE'S BEEN  A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ITS TERRIBLE  CORE ROSIVE DEMOCRACY-DESTROYING  EFFECTS BUT IS THERE AN UPSIDE. JOHN OLIVER HAS MORE.
MEGA DONOR AND SUPER PACS ARE  SPENDING BIG FLOODING THE  AIRWAVES WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED  QUANTITY OF POLITICAL IDEAS. IT'S NO PRIZE PEOPLE ARE UPSET.
THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE  ELECTION EVER.
OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS  REALLY GOING DOWN THE TUBES. WE'VE GOT TO GET MONEY OUT OF  POLITICS.
POLITICAL ACTIVIST DAVID  DONNELLLY EXPLAINS THE PROBLEM.
WITH A LOT MORE MONEY IN  ELECTIONS YOU SEE POTENTIAL FOR  CORRUPTION. THE SOURCE OF A MONEY IS A SMALL  NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THIS MAN FOR EXAMPLE.
HOW MUCH IS HE WORTH?
$25 BILLION.
THERE'S SOME MILK LEFT IN  THAT COW.
THERE'S A LOT OF MILK LEFT.
WE HAVE TO MILK THAT MAN.
THAT'S WHAT KARL ROVE IS  DOING RIGHT NOW.
MILLING HIM FOR AMERICA. COME ON.
NOT FOR AMERICA --
AHHH.
THE POINT IS THAT SOME PEOPLE  SEE CRISIS WHERE OTHERS SEE  OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS A PRIVATE STIMULUS  PACKAGE FOR THE AMERICAN  ECONOMY.
YOU ARE SUGGESTING A JOBS  PROGRAM THROUGH ELECTION  SPENDING.
EXACTLY. WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?
IT DOESN'T BENEFIT AMERICA. MOST AMERICANS ARE SINGED BY IT.
REALLY? WHAT ABOUT THESE AMERICANS THEY  ARE BUSY MAKING HATS AND TOTE  BAGS NORMALLY MANUFACTURED BY  ANYMOREIBLE FINGERED MALAYSIAN  CHILDREN. IT'S THANKS TO ELECTION  SPENDING. WE LEARN WHY.
HALF WORK IS DIRECTLY  ELECTION BASED.
THEY COULD GET THE BASEBALL  HATS CHEAPER FROM FOREIGN  SWEATSHOPS BUT THEY CAN'T  BECAUSE --
IF THEY GET CAUGHT WHICH THEY  WILL IT WILL COST SO MUCH MORE  MONEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BACK  PEDAL. APOLOGIZE, CHANGE THEIR MESSAGE.
THESE JOBS ARE ALL IN PART  BUILT ON THE KIND OF ELECTORAL  JINGLISM PART OF MODERN CAMPAIGN  CULTURE.
OUR BUSINESS IS BUILT ON  THANK YOU HAVE THE EAGLE BY THE  BALLS, MITCH.
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE  BUT IT MAKES SENSE.
ALL DAY, MITCH. ALL DAY. THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT THERE'S  TOO MUCH MONEY IN ELECTIONS IT'S  THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH  ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. LUCKILY THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO  FIX THAT.
OUR NATION IS IN TROUBLE. DEBT, FORECLOSURES, A SLUGGISH  ECONOMY. BUT THIS IS AMERICA AND WE'VE  GOT A SIM WAY TO FIX OUR  PROBLEMS. SPEND MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY  TO TELL AMERICA HOW TO FIX OUR  PROBLEMS. IT'S CALLED ELECTION SPENDING.
CUT.
HI, REMEMBER ME WITH THE PIE? I'M AN ACTRESS. I'M GETTING PAID $313 FOR DOING  THIS. SO IS MY SON. AND MY BACK-UP SON.
I'M JUST HERE IN CASE THIS  KID HAS A MELTDOWN.
THERE ARE MOTHERS, OUR  FATHERS, OUR COWORKERS BUT MOST  IMPORTANTLY THEY ARE ALL PAID  ACTORS. AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE.
I WORK IN POST PRODUCTION  ADDING TO GRAPHICS.
I MAKE $1.75 AN HOUR AND I  DON'T WORK FAST.
AMERICAN MONEY, AMERICAN JOBS  LIKE SPEAKING INTO A MICROPHONE  FOR CASH AND IT COULD BE SO MUCH  BIGGER. IN 2000 ELECTION SPENDING WAS $3  BILLION N.2052 IT COULD BE 100%  OF THE G.D.P.
EVERYONE WHO MATTERS BENEFITS  OPPOSITION RESEARCHERS, PAID  CONSULTANTS, C.E.O.S OF MAJOR  MEDIA CONGLOMERATES AND  EMPLOYEES. THIS ELECTION SHOULD BE ABOUT  ONE ISSUE, ELECTIONS THEMSELVES. LET'S HAVE MORE ELECTIONS,  CONSTANT ELECTIONS, NEVER-ENDING  ELECTIONS. IT'S NOT A TERRIBLE SICKENING  IDEA, IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT  SICKENING IDEA.
YOU THINK THIS WAS CHEAP?
THANK YOU, AMERICA! YOU'RE WELCOME, AMERICA.
PAID FOR BY AMERICANS CUTE  ENOUGH TO BE IN
