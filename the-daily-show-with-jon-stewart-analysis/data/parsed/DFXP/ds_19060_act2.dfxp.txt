WELCOME BACK! EVEN LONG AFTER THE SEATTLE  SEAHAWKS CELEBRATED SUNDAY'S  BRING THE BRONCOS TO WORK DAY,  ONE SUPER BOWL CONTROVERSY RAGES ON.
COCA-COLA, THEY'RE GETTING A  LOT OF CRITICISM.
COKE COMMERCIAL ALSO SPARKED  CONTROVERSY.
POSSIBLY THE MOST  CONTROVERSIAL SUPER BOWL AD.   THERE WAS A BOYCOTT COKE HASH  TAG TRENDING LAST NIGHT ON  TWITTER.
ON THE INTERNET, THERE'S A  LOT OF BACKLASH.
WHAT HAPPENED?   DID JANET JACKSON OPEN A COKE  CAN WITH HER TEET?   IF SHE COULD, I WOULD LIKE TO  SEE THAT.   WHAT TOXIC SMUT DID COCA-COLA  AIR TO SO BUNCH AMERICA'S  UNDERGARMENTS?   ♪ FOR SPACIOUS SKIES ♪POR TUS OLAS DE GRANOS AMBER ♪ [AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES] ♪♪  [LAUGHTER] THAT UPSET PEOPLE?   WERE THEY BOTHERED BY THE  DANGEROUS LEVELS OF SHMALTZ?   I WILL GRANT YOU IF THERE WERE A PRECIOUS MOMENTS FIGURINE WHERE  AN ORPHAN HANDED A PUPPY TO A  KINDLY SOLDIER TITLED I WUV  AMERICA, IT WOULD BE LESS SAPPY  THAN THAT AD.   BUT I'M GUESSING THAT WASN'T THE ISSUE.
THE AD FEATURED PEOPLE FROM  MANY ETHNICITIES SINGING THE SONG ONE PERSON TWEETED, NEVER BUYING COKE AGAIN. AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH IS JUST WRONG.
ANOTHER GUY WRITES, "COCA-COLA HAS LOST ITS MIND, OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IN OTHER  LANGUAGES, THAT IS UN-AMERICAN  AS POSSIBLE." [LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY THING MORE DELICIOUS THAN A TALL COOL GLASS OF COCA-COLA IS THE IRONY THAT THE  SELF APPOINTED PATRIOTIC  AMERICAN WATCH DOGS SEEM UNAWARE THAT OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM IS IN FACT NOT AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL.  REALLY, PEOPLE?   THIS IS THE SUPER BOWL AD YOU'RE GOING TO GET UPSET ABOUT WHEN  YOU HAD SOME SORT OF GREEK  YOGURT SEX GAME GOING ON OR A  SPOT CELEBRATING THE UNNATURAL  LOVE BETWEEN A DOG AND A HORSE?  THERE WAS AN AD WHERE A MAN'S  HEAD WAS CRACKED OPEN.   OH, MY GOD!   OH, MY GOD!   IT REVEALED HIS SMALLER OTHER  GREEN HEAD APPARENTLY FOR THE  PURPOSE OF SELLING SOME KIND OF  NUT.   I CAN'T RECALL THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF NUT.   I RECALL ENJOYING THE AD  THINKING IT WAS VERY AMUSING.   I CAN'T RECALL THE TYPE OF NUT HE  WAS SELLING.   OF COURSE, THE NOW INFAMOUS HALF TIME AD FOR TURBOTAX.   WHAT IS THAT?   WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH  TAX RETURNS?   I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THOSE  PEOPLE ARE EVEN ACCOUNTANTS.   SO CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN  WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM WITH A GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE IMMIGRANTS SINGING A BELOVED AMERICAN SONG  IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGES?
I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE  IS, THERE ARE A LOT OF  PEOPLE  UNFORTUNATELY ARE COMING TO  AMERICA NOW, NOT ASSIMILATING.
ASSIMILATING?   THEY'RE SINGING AMERICA THE  BEAUTIFUL WHILE DRINKING  COCA-COLA.   HOW MUCH MORE AMERICAN  ASSIMILATION CAN THEY HAVE?   MAYBE IF THEY WERE OPEN CARRYING A GUN SHAPED LIKE JESUS WHILE  USING A BALD EAGLE STRAP ON TO  [BLEEP] AN APPLE PIE.   BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE, WHAT ELSE?   YOU KNOW, ALL THESE SELF  APPOINTED PATRIOTS WHO ARE  COMPLAINING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT  NATIONALITIES IN THAT AD HAD  ANCESTORS WHO CAME FROM DIFFERENT NATIONS THEMSELVES,  EUROPE MOSTLY, AND MANY OF THOSE EARLY EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS CLUNG TO THE NATIVE TONGUES LONGER THAN WAS COMFORTABLE FOR THE XENOPHOBES OF THEIR TIME.   I THINK THIS WILL REFRESH YOUR MEMORY  ♪-OH BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES  ♪  ♪ [VARIOUS EUROPEAN LANGUAGES] ♪ AMERICA  ♪ AMERICA  ♪ AND CROWN THY GOOD  ♪ WITH BROTHERHOOD  ♪ ♪[FOREIGN LANGUAGE] L'CHAIM!
