Stewart: SO WE ARE TALKING  A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FOREIGN  POLICIES AND THE PROXY WARS. PRESIDENT OBAMA MET WITH  RUSSIAN'S PRESIDENT PUTIN, HEAD  OF THE G-20 THIS WEEK AND AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION HE DECIDED  AH, I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT,  SO INSTEAD OUR, WE DECIDED TO GIVE DIPLOMACY A BIT OF A TRY.
SINCE 1989 THE UNITED STATES  AND RUSSIA HAVE BEEN ALLIES BUT  RECENTLY THE NATIONS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH ONE CRISIS  NESTLED INSIDE OTT CRISIS INSIDE  ANOTHER. TO SEE HOW TO KEEP THESE TWO  NATIONS FROM ANOTHER COLD WAR I  SAT DOWN WHO HEADS THE KREMLIN APPROVED POLICY GROUP. LET'S START WITH AN EASY ISSUE. EDWARD SNOWDEN.
YOU DON'T WANT HIM AND WE DO  WANT HIM. WHY CAN'T WE FIGURE THIS (BLEEP)  OUT LIKE RIGHT NOW?
THIS WAS YOUR FAULT. WHY THE HELL YOU CANCELED HIS  PASSPORT IN MOSCOW AIRPORT?  YOU  CREATED ALL OF THIS MESS.
AH!  DON'T TURN THIS AROUND  AND BLAME ME FOR THIS.
THIS IS AMERICAN PROBLEM. YOU CREATED THIS PROBLEM. WE ARE THE VICTIMS OF THIS  SITUATION.
RUSSIA IS THE VICTIM?
YES.
RUSSIA IS THE VICTIM.
OH, RUSSIA IS THE VICTIM. 158 POUNDS OF PASTY NERD WALKS  INTO YOUR COUNTRY AND YOU ARE  POWERLESS TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT  IT.
HE IS AN UNWELCOMED GUEST.
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH GUEST  WHOSE DON'T LEAVE I SHAVE MY  LEGS WHILE I AM WATCHING TV.
WE ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS.
MAYBE WE SHOULD DISCUSS  SOMETHING THAT NEVER SEEMS TO  ELICIT STRONG OPINION, RUSSIA'S TREATMENT OF GAYS.
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT GAY  PEOPLE ARE SO OBSESSED WITH  THEIR WELL-BEING?  LIKE NOT GETTING A CAB OR GETTING PUT IN  JAIL.
GAY PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME  RIGHTS AS THE OTHER PEOPLE, JUST  DON'T MANIFEST THIS IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR PUBLIC WITH ALL  OF THIS KIND OF PARADES, YOU  KNOW, MASS DEMONSTRATION.
SO BETTER TO NOT BE GAY AT  ALL?
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THIS  IS A KIND OF INFERIORITY  COMPLEX. WHY THE HELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE  PARADES?
YES, THESE GAY PRIDE PARADES  CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE AN  INFERIORITY COMPLEX WITH ALL OF THEIR PHALLIC IMAGERY, WE GET IT  GUYS, YOU ARE GAY, GET YOUR  (BLEEP) OUT OF MY FACE. ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS LOOK TO  THEIR PRESIDENT TO SEE WHAT IS  AN APPROPRIATE PUBLIC DISPLAY.
QUITE NATURAL PICTURE.
OKAY. HAT ABOUT THIS PICTURE, THOUGH?   COME ON.
IT IS QUITE NORMAL. WHEN, YOU KNOW, WHEN MAN, MACHO,  IS, YOU KNOW, RIDING THE HORSE  --
THE GUY LOOKS LIKE A GAY  CENTAUR.
HE IS ONE GLITTER CANNON AWAY  FROM LEADING A GAY PARADE.
IT IS YOUR FANTASY.
OKAY, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO  AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THE GAY  STUFF. I JUST -- I -- I -- AH -- NO. NO. I --
NO. I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO OPEN UP  THE ONE ISSUE AT THE  GEOPOLITICAL HEART OF OUR  DIFFERENCES.
EVER SINCE I GOT THIS RIGHT  HERE.
OH. SYRIA. LET'S TALK ABOUT DISARMING  ASSAD.
HERE IS HOW WE SEE IT. RUSSIA IS PROPPING UP ASSAD WITH  MONEY AND WEAPONS AND WE THINK  YOU SHOULD STOP.
NO, NO. RUSSIA IS AGAINST REGIME CHANGE  FROM OUTSIDE. THIS IS PRINCIPAL RUSSIAN  POSITION.
ISN'T IT AMAZING WHEN  INNOCENT CIVILIANS GET KILLED  SOMETIMES EMOTIONS GET IN THE WAY, BUT RUSSIA SEEMS IMMUNE TO  THAT.
LISTEN, LOOK AT THE MIRROR,  DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE  KILLED IN IRAQ AFTER AMERICAN  INVASION?
OH, HERE WE GO.
200,000 --
HOW MANY MILLIONS WERE  DISPLACED?
WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS  CONVERSATION.
NO, NO, NO. BUT YOU ARE ENDLESSLY TRYING TO  BLAME RUSSIA FOR DOING SOME BAD  THING.
OKAY, YOU WANT TO HAVE A --
YES, WE NEED TO HAVE A --
OKAY. AFGHANISTAN. GO.
YES. AFGHANISTAN. IT WAS A TRAGIC EVENT IN SOVIET  HISTORY, AND NOW YOU ARE  REPEATING SOVIET EXPERIENCE.
AH!  I DON'T WANT TO HEAR  THIS!  RRRR.
AND SUDDENLY IT HIT ME. MAYBE WE WEREN'T SO DIFFERENT  AFTER ALL.
I HAVE GOT AN IDEA. YOU PROPPED UP DICTATORS AND WE  HAVE PROPPED UP DICTATORS, WHY  CAN'T WE PROP UP THE SAME RUTHLESS DICTATORS?
OH, WE CAN DO THAT.
AT LEAST WE AGREE ON  SOMETHING. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: WE WILL BE RIGHT
