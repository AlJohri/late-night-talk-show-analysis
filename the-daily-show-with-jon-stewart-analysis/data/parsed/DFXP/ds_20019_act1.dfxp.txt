[LAUGHTER] SO I DON'T, YOU KNOW, HOW DID IT GO?
A HUGE NIGHT FOR THE GOP. START LOOKING UP SYNONYMS FOR THE TERM SHELLACKING.  >>THE BLOOD BATH >>A SEISMIC SHIFT ITS A LANDSIDE A POLITICAL TYPHOON A TIDAL WAVE >>JON: A TECTONIC SKULL(BLEEP) BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE NEW CONGRESSION SEAL [LAUGHTER] FEEL FREE TO PRINT IT OUT. PUT IT ON YOUR BACKPACK TO SHOW PEOPLE YOUR GRADE SCHOOL, YOU'RE INTERESTED IN POLITICS. [LAUGHTER] I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH BETTER THAT LOOKS THAN THE ORIGINAL  VERSION OF THE ELEPHANT SKULL(BLEEP) A DONKEY. IT REALLY THE ORIGINAL VERSION LOOKED A LITTLE TOO CONCENSUAL ANYWAY HOUSE SENATE, GOVERNORS, YOU NAME IT, REPUBLICANS WON IT. T WAS A NECK AND NECK BATTLE BUT IT TURNED OUT AN EASY WIN FOR THE GOP.
REPUBLICAN THOM TILLIS UN SEATED DEMOCRATIC SENATOR  KAY HAGEN DAVID PERDUE WON  GOVERNER EXPANSIONS IN RELIABLY BLUE STATES LIKE ILLINOIS AND MARYLAND NINE BATTLE GROUND RACES REPUBLICANS WON SIX OF THEM.
Jon:  DUMA AND CHINA'S PEOPLES CONGRESS NOW SOLIDLY REPUBLICAN. THE BLUE MAN GROUP NOW THE RED MAN GROUP HAVING LOST OF TWO OF THREE MEN CHILDREN WILL NOW LEARN VALUABLE LESSONS FROM RED'S CLUES THE ONLY TERRITORY DEMOCRATS RETAINED IS THAT PAINFUL SEXUAL FRUSTRATION WILL STILL BE KNOWN AS BLUE BALLS. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE ONLY AREA DEMOCRATS. WE DON'T HAVE A GRAPHIC OF BLUE BALLS, HUH? [LAUGHTER] NOTHING?Ã­ ELEPHANT SKULL[BLEEP] A DONKEY THAT CAME UP  BLUE BALLS. NO, NO. YOU GOT TO BE A PHOTO OF A KID SOMEWHERE GOING ... [LAUGHTER] AND YES, FOX NEWS WAS AFIRE CELEBRATING WITH THEY HAD FIREWORKS. THEY HAD A HOE DOWN. THEY HAD GRINS CAPABLE OF EATING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF [BLEEP] MIDTERM TSUNAMI STRIPPED EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES. WE POSTED THIS TO FACEBOOK AND YOUR COMMENTS ARE ROLLING IN.
Jon:  AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO PLAY FARMVILLE. ON THE OTHER NETWORK, THE ONLY SUSPENSE WAS WHETHER OR NOT JOHN KING AS HE WAS WORKING HIS MAGIC WALL WOULD YES, I'M GOING TO CALL IT AT 9:21 EASTERN STANDARD TIME JOHN KING HAS GONE FULL [BLEEP] DOODLE. HE WENT FULL [BLEEP] DOODLE AND BY THE WAY, INTERNET, DON'T BOTHER MAKING AN ANIMATED GIF OUT OF THAT INTERNET BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE [LAUGHTER] WE'RE 12 YEARS OLD. LOOK THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE SENATE AND GOVERNORSHIPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I IMAGINE THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS RIGHTWARD HO
I THINK YOU'LL SEE AN END TO GRID LOCK.
I KNOW THE VALUE OF BIPARTISANSHIP I KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER.
WORKING TOGETHER CAN ACTUALLY HAVE RESULTS.
LET'S SEE IF WE COULD PUT TO AGREEMENTS.
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A TWO PARTY SYSTEM DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO BE IN PERPETUAL CONFLICT.
Jon:  WHO THE [BLEEP] ARE YOU PEOPLE? WOW THAT WAS -- I GOT TO TELL YOU. [APPLAUSE] THAT SOUNDS BITE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NOT COMING FROM THE GUY WHO FOR SIX YEARS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE SOLE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF THIS COUNTRY'S PERPETUAL CONFLICTONATORS. FOR MORE ON THE REPUBLICAN'S MIDTERM VICTORY WE TURN TO SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST JORDAN  KLEPPER. JORDAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THIS NEW UNGRID LOCKED GOP. CAN THE GOP FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR PLEDGE TO GET SOMETHING DONE FOR AMERICA?
CAN THEY?
Jon: YES.
LOOK, LAST NIGHT AT APPROXIMATELY 11:27 EASTERN TIME, THE REPUBLICAN GAINED CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE AND RESULTS WERE ALMOST IMMEDIATE. THE ECONOMY NOW GOING AT A ROBUST 3.5%. GAS THIS MORNING, UNDER 3 BUCKS. A GALLON. LOOK, STOCK MARKET AT RECORD LEVELS. DEFICITS CUT IN HALF. 10 MILLION MORE AMERICANS HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND UNEMPLOYMENT SUB-SIX PERCENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE ELECTED CHAIRMAN OBAMA.
Jon: WELL WAIT, HANG ON A SECOND JORDAN BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING --
LIKE EVEN EBOLA, JON THINK ABOUT THIS, WHICH WAS ON THE VERGE OF DESTROYING THE COUNTRY UNDER OBAMA'S FECKLESS LEADERSHIP HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A PROBLEM FOR LIKE ONE GUY. [LAUGHTER] IT'S MORNING IN AMERICA JON.
Jon: JORDAN, THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE LIST THAT YOU TICKED OFF OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED UNDER OBAMA AND THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE.
OH PLEASE. JON, IF THE DEMOCRATS HAD ACCOMPLISHED ALL OF THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT THERE BRAGGING ABOUT IT FOR MONTHS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CENTRAL MESSAGE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN INSTEAD OF THEIR ACTUAL MESSAGE WHICH IS LIKE I'M QUOTING THIS HERE. WE'RE SORRY, DON'T BE MAD. [LAUGHTER] WE DON'T LIKE OBAMA EITHER, WE LIKE GUNS TOO. AMEN.
Jon:  JORDAN, EVERYTHING YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS EXACTLY HOW THINGS WERE BEFORE LAST NIGHT.
NO, NO, NOT FROM WHERE I'M STANDING. IT'S LIKE SUDDENLY THIS COUNTRY, IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE FILLED WITH LIKE IN ANTICIPATION, AN OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATION. IT'S LIKE A SENSE OF --
Jon: HOPE. IT'S HOPE.
RIGHT, BUT MORE THAN THAT IT'S AS THOUGH ... [LAUGHTER] THINGS ARE GOING TO BE, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY ONCE WERE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE GOING --
Jon: THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE. IT'S HOPE AND CHANGE.
YES.
Jon: HOPE AND CHANGE.
YES.
Jon:  YOU FEEL IT TOO, JON. HOPE AND CHANGE. THAT'S THE REPUBLICAN MESSAGE.
THE REPUBLICANS CANNOT, THE REPUBLICANS CANNOT CLAIM THAT AS THEIR MESSAGE.
Jon:  YES THEY CAN, YES THEY CAN. JON, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY CAN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEY'RE GRATEFUL. THEY'VE ALREADY SET ASIDE THE LAST THURSDAY IN NOVEMBER AS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY TO GIVE REPUBLICANS THANKS FOR ALL THESE BLESSINGS.
THAT'S NOT THE REPUBLICANS THAT'S THANKSGIVING. YOU CAN'T CREDIT THAT TO THE REPUBLICANS. IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR 150 YEARS.
DISAGREE. RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.
Jon: SO THINGS ARE INSTANTLY MUCH BETTER NOW BUT WE STILL HAVE PROBLEMS. IMMIGRATION CRISES. INCOME INEQUITY.
YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT. [BLEEP] OBAMA.
Jon: THANK YOU JORDAN. JORDAN KLEPPER EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
