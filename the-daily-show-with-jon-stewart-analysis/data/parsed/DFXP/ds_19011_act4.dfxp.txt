WE'RE BACK DISCUSSING CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER'S BOOK "THINGS THAT MATTER." THE THING THAT HAPPENS ON THIS PROGRAM ALL THE TIME IS PEOPLE COME ON AND TALK ABOUT THE REASONABLE NATURE OF THEIR POSITIONS, BUT THE TACTICS NEVER MATCH IT. WE HAD A REPUBLICAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OSTENSIBLY UNDER THE GUISE OF PROTECTING THE ECONOMY SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT COSTING US $24 BILLION AND IN ESSENCE DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. WHEN YOU SPEAK LIKE THIS AND YOU SAY, WELL, THEY -- THE REAL THOUGHT BEHIND ALL THIS IS QUITE REASONABLE, WE DON'T GET TO SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED THE BOOK. [ LAUGHTER ] LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU.
Jon: YEAH.
THERE ARE DIVISIONS WITHIN CONSERVATIVES AND I THINK THERE'S A LARGE ELEMENT OF IT WHICH YOU ARE MISSING. I DON'T THINK IT'S DELIBERATE THAT THE OTHER SIDE THE MORE RADICAL ELEMENTS ARE THE LOUDER RAONES. IF YOU'D WATCH ME, ANDR AGAIN YOU DON'T WATCH ENOUGH FOX. IF YOU WATCHED OVER THE LAST MONTH I'M OPPOSED TO THE TACTICS OF THOSE WHO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. THAT IT WOULD NOT WORK, IT WAS UNNECESSARY AND THERE WAS NO WAY THAT UNDER OUR CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE THAT YOU CAN UNDO OBAMACARE THE LAW OF THE LAND FROM A HOUSE OF CONGRESS. THE THING THAT DEFINES THE TEA THE THIPARTY IS A KIND OFE TEA CONSTITUTIONAL SPIRIT AT ITS BEST. IT AROSE AS A REACTION TO WHAT IT SAW AS THE EXCESSES OF OBAMA, THE TRILLION DOLLAR STIMULUS AND TTHE TAKEOVER OF A SIXTH OF THED AMERICAN ECONOMY, AND IT GROWS WITHOUT LEADERS OR WITHOUT ANY KIND OF ALTERIOR MOTIVE. I THINK IT SAW -- IT DIDN'T -- THE ONE THING IT DIDN'T DO -- AND THIS IS WHERE I CRITICIZED IT -- IT WANTED TO SEE A RETURN TO LIMITED GOVERNMENT. I WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THEM AS I DID ON THE AIR BUT ALSO A CHAPTER IN THE BOOK ON THIS. IF YOU ARE TRULY CONSTITUTIONAL IN THAT SENSE THEN YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE MADISONIAN STRUCTURE WHICH HAS A DIVISION OF POWER, THE ESSENCE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE REASON WE'VE SUCCEED FOR TWO  CENTURIES. YOU DIVIDE POWER AND YOU CANNOT GOVERN AS A MINORITY PARTY. YOU CAN BE A BLOCKER. YOU CAN CAUSE GRIDLOCK IN THE MADISONIAN STRUCTURE. IT'S INTENDED TO PREVENT TYRANNY. YOU CAN'T GOVERN IF YOU ARE A MINORITY AND THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WAS DONE WRONG HERE.
LET ME PAINT A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE OF THAT. SURPRISE ME. [LAUGHTER] RATHER THAN A SPONTANEOUS GRASSROOTS REVOLUTION BASED ON THE EXCESSES OF OBAMA AND HIS TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT, I SEE IT AS THE NATURAL PROGRESSION OF REPUBLICAN RHETORIC IN POLITICS OVER 40 YEARS WHICH IS PLAY UPON CONSERVATIVE ANGER, ENRAGE THEM, RIDE THAT ENERGY BUT DON'T ALLOW THEM TO BE IN THE GOVERNING POSITION. STILL MAINTAIN A CERTAIN CONSERVATIVE ELITE POWER STRUCTURE THAT HARNESSES THEIR ANGER. KARL ROVE WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN THE 2004 ELECTORAL PLAN, WE'RE GOING TO FIND THEIR ANGER POINTS  WE WE'RE GOING TO SQUEEZE THEM. I DON'T THINK THEY WERE RESPONDING TO OBAMA. HE WASN'T THERE LONG ENOUGH FOR IT TO HAPPEN. IT WAS DAY ONE. THEY WERE RESPONDING TO MEDICARE PLAN D, COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM, AND WHAT THEY WERE RESPONDING TO WAS THE SEEDS OFANGER THAT KARL ROVE AND MANY OF THOSE, ATWATER AND ALL  THOSE GUYS HAVE SEWN AND RIDDEN THE SOUTHERN STRATEGY FOR YEARS  AND YEARS. AND NOW THE BEAST THEY MADE IN THE LAB WANTS TO  CONTROL AND HAVE POWER AND THAT IS WHERE THIS BATTLE IS.
IT'S AN EXCELLENT ELABORATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S WRONG.
Jon: WHAT? WHAT? [LAUGHTER] I THINK THERE'S A COMMON GROUND BETWEEN BOTH NARRATIVES THAT CAN BE SHOWN HERE.
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE POLITICS OF IT. ON YOUR SIDE ALAN GRAYSON'S WHO PUT OUT AN AD WITH AN EMAIL WITH TEA PARTY WITH A T AS A FLAMINGH CROSS.
Jon: HE'S ONE DUDE.
YOU ARE SWEPT UP. THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF POLITICAL CULTURE. IT'S RAPID. WE HAVE THE SOCIAL MEDIA. A LOT OF STUFF EMERGES IN THE BLOGO SPHERE THAT WON'T HAVE EMERGED LONG AGO. I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING TOO MUCH AT THE EXTREMES THAT EXPRESS THEM SELF- THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS SIMPLE. GIVE ME 30 SECONDS.
Jon: OKAY.
CAN YOU HANG ON?
Jon: I CAN.
IN THAT CASE GIVE ME A MINUTE.
Jon: I CAN'T HANG ON THAT LONG. I HAVE TO TALK BEFORE THEN.
WE'RE NEGOTIATING.
Jon: 45 SECONDS GO.
HERE IT IS. WE HAVE THE WELFARE STATE WHICH HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. IT'S A CRISIS POINT WHERE IT HAS TO DECIDE WHICH WAY IT'S GOING TO GO. THERE'S A REASONABLE ARGUMENT ON YOUR SIDE WITH ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE WANT IS ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. THE FUNDAMENTAL ARGUMENT IS NOT ANGER OR RESENTMENT IT'S THAT WE'RE AT THE LIMITS. WE HAVE $17 TRILLION IN DEBT. WE'RE NOT AT THE POINT TO ADD A NEW ENTITLEMENT, THE COUNTRY CANNOT SUSTAIN IT AND IT WILL RUIN ALL THE ADVANCES THAT WE HAVE MADE IF YOU DESTROY AN ECONOMY, YOU ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING. AND THEY ARE SAYING -- AND THIS IS AGAIN THE BEST ARGUMENT, THE MOST HONORABLE ONE. I GRANT YOUR SIDE THE MOST HONORABLE EXPOSITION. YOU OUGHT TO GRANT THE OTHER SIDE. I THINK IT'S A GREAT ARGUMENT. I WELCOME IT AND I THINK IT'S WHAT THE COUNTRY OUGHT TO BE DISCUSSING. DO YOU WANT TO DISCUSS A GRAYSON ON YOUR SIDE OR LOONEY ON MY SIDE, OKAY BUT THAT'S A DISTRACTION. THE QUESTION IS WHICH WAY DOES THE WELFARE STATE GO.
Jon: UNDERSTANDABLE. LET ME ADDRESS THAT IF YOU'VE GOT -- GIVE ME TWO AND A HALF MINUTES.
I'VE ALREADY LOST.
Jon: YOU ARE PAINTING A SITUATION THAT I AM CHERRY PICKING SOME LUNATIC FRINGE OF THE RIGHT. ALAN GRAYSON DIDN'T TRY TO SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A MOVEMENT AMONGST THE RIGHT THAT IS NOT ON THE FRINGE THAT LACKS POWER. THIS IS THE CONTROLLING ETHOS. THERE ARE MODERATE REPUBLICANS AS YOU SPEAK OF THAT HAVE A MORE CONSERVATIVE  ETHOS, DO ACCEPT A CERTAIN STATUS QUO OF THE LIBERAL SOCIAL SAFETY NET BUT THEY ARE NOT THE ONES CONTROLLING THE ETHOS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO FEAR BEING PRIMARIED ON THE RIGHT BY ALL THE MONEY COMING IN. THEY'VE ORGANIZED THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THIS IDEA THAT THE DEBT CEILING A POLITICAL FOOTBALL AND BEYOND THAT, THIS IDEA THAT THE WELFARE STATE IS AT A CRISIS POINT. WE HAVE TO DECIDE, THE TAX BITE IS THE LOWEST ON INCOME SINCE 1961 BUT THERE'S A REFUSAL TO BUDGE ON ANY LOOPHOLES OF ANY NEW TAXES AND ANY NEW REVENUE. IT'S FOOLHARDY TO SAY IT'S AN EQUIVALENT ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE FRINGE ON THE LEFT AND THE FRINGE ON THE RIGHT. THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACCEPTED THE STATUS QUO CONSENSUS THAN THERE IS A LARGE GROUP OF NIHILISTS SLOWLY CONSUMING AND CONTROLLING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOT ALLOWING THE CONVERSATION TO OCCUR AND USING THEIR CHAOS DELEGITIMIZE ALL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.
CONTROLLING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I THINK PERHAPS THAT IS A LIBERAL WISH.
DID JOHN BOEHNER NOT SAY I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS BUT I HAD TO FOLLOW MY CAUCUS?
WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND MAKING IT INTO A COSMIC IDEA LOGICAL STRUCTURE.
Jon: I SMOKE A LOT OF DOPE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN TALKE. THIS COSMICALLY. WERE YOU IN COLORADO?
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ARGUMENT OVER TACTICS AS IF IT'S THE ESSENCE OF THIS. THIS IS A MATTER OF TACTICS TO SHUTGOWN THE GOVERNMENT. WHERE DO YOU APPLY THE PRESSURE? THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT  OBAMACARE, THIS BRAND NEW ENTITLEMENT IS THE ISSUE. IT'S NOT HOW YOU GET THERE, HOW YOU REPEAL IT. IF YOU ARE GOING TO ADD A TRILLION DOLLAR ENTITLEMENT ONTO AN ECONOMY WITH 17 TRILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT, YOU'RE HEADED OVER A CLIFF. THAT SEEMS TO BE REASONABLE -- I DISAGREE WITH THE RADICALS, IF YOU LIKE, WITHIN THE PARTY ON WHAT TACTIC YOU USE WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY A MINORITY IN THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ISN'T A CONSENSUS ON THE MAJOR OBJECTIVES.
WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE AND WHY ARE TAXES OFF THE TABLE? WHY IS THE IDEA THAT IF THE TAX BITE ON INCOME IS THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN SINCE 1961. TO HEAR THEM TALK, YOU KNOW, WE ARE AT LEVELS WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE THE 50'S OR 60'S. IT'S NOT TRUE.
IT'S SIMPLY NOT RIGHT. THE CBO ISSUED A REPORT LAST WEEK. AS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A PARTISAN.
Jon: I BUY IT.
THAT SAID THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW WE HAD THE TAX HIKE ON JANUARY 1. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE TAX RECEIPTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE 18.5% OF G.D.P. WHICH IS HISTORICALLY ABOVE THE LEVEL FROM WORLD WAR II UNTIL TODAY.
Jon: IT'S NOT A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME. IT'S A DIFFERENT NUMBER.
IT'S A PERCENTAGE OF G.D.P.
Jon: BUT IT'S NOT A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME.
EXPENDITURES IS WAY OVER THE LIMIT. YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO RETURN TO THE TAXATION RATES OF WHAT REAGAN WAS YOUNG.
Jon: I DON'T BELIEVE IT. BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS A WAY TO GO BACK TO SOME CLINTONIAN RATES TO BRING CAPITAL GAINS MORE IN LINE WITH INCOME TAX. THE RATE TODAY IS THE CLINTONIAN RATE.
Jon: WHICH JUST STARTED AND IT WAS A HUGE FIGHT. I'M OF THE BELIEF THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DYSFUNCTIONAL IN PROCESS BECAUSE OF THIS. AND SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE'S BLOAT AND INCOMPETENCE IN THE WAY WE DO THINGS. MY GREATEST FRUSTRATION WITH THIS GOVERNMENT IS THAT THEY RAN ON THE IDEA THAT THE FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT, THE BUREAUCRACY WAS CORRUPTED AND NEEDED TO BE CHANGED. AND YET HAS GONE WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT I THINK NEEDED TO BE EXPLOITED. JUST THIS WEB SITE. NOW THEY ARE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO FLY AND GET THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST FROM SILICON VALLEY TO TROUBLESHOOT IT AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT THREE YEARS AGO. THE WEB SITE'S FAILURE IS TRAGIC TO ME BECAUSE I FEEL TERRIBLE THAT PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS AND WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE NOT GETTING IT BUT IT'S NOT A REASON TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE OF A RETHE GOVERNMENT'S LACK OFE OF EFFICIENCY.
THE POINT THAT A CONSERVATIVE OUGHT TO MAKE, IT'S IN THE BOOK. A SINGLE BOOK. IT'S NOT ONLY AN ECONOMIC ARGUMENT AGAINST ALL OF THESE ENTITLEMENTS THE GOVERNMENT REACHES THE LIMITS OF WHAT YOU CAN DO. I CARE AS MUCH AS YOU DO ABOUT INSURING THE UNINSURED. A DECENT SOCIETY OUGHT TO DO THAT. BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU AND YOUR SIDE IS THEN WHY WOULD YOU THEN COMPLETELY REMAKE 16% OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. OVER 80% OF THE AMERICANS HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THE VAST MAJORITY ALREADY LIKE IT. BUT INSTEAD WHAT OBAMA AND COMPANY HAVE DECIDED TO DO IS REMAKE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TODAY ARE RECEIVING IN THE MAIL A NOTICE OF THE  CANCELLATION OF THEIR INSURANCE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARDS ARBITRARILY SET UP UNDER YOUR REGULATIONS. WHY WOULD YOU REMAKE A 6th OF THE ECONOMY WHEN YOU COULD OF ADDRESS THE UNINSURED. IT'S WHAT A CONSERVATIVE WOULD DO.
I THINK ONE THING YOU COULD HAVE DONE WAS EXPANDED MEDICARE AND --
WHY DIDN'T DO YOU THAT?
ONE THING YOU COULD HAVE DONE.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT WE DIDN'T REMAKE THAT.
YOU AND I WOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE ON THIS STUFF. WHAT YOUR SIDE DID INSTEAD IS REMAKE THE ENTIRE MEDICAL SYSTEM.
Jon: WHAT THEY DID. THEY THINK SINGLE PAYER WAS REMAKING THE SYSTEM. WHAT THEY TRIED TO DO IS CREATE A MARKET BASED INSURANCE IDEA, ONE THAT WAS HATCHED BY THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, BY THE WAY, ONE THAT WAS A REPUBLICAN IDEA TEN YEARS AGO, ONLY TO BE DISAVOWED NOW BECAUSE OBAMA EMBRACED IT. HE TRIED TO LATCH ON TO THAT IDEA THINKING IT WAS A COMPROMISE RATHER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PREFERABLE TO THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHANGEOVER TO SINGLE PAYER. WHAT HE IS SAYING 80% OF THE COUNTRY HAS INSURANCE LET'S CREATE A MARKETPLACE FOR 20% AND NOT TOUCH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE  OBAMACARE IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS AND 80% OF THE PEOPLE ALREADY DO.
THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT LIBERALS. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING --
Jon: SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT ME. DON'T MAKE THIS A LARGER ARGUMENT. THIS IS ME. THIS IS WHAT I THINK.
YOU ARE THE OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN FOR THE LIBERALS.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I AM? A CONTRARIAN ASS THAT'S ALL I AM.
YOU ARE BEING OVERLY MODEST AND TO SOME EXTENT PROPERLY MODEST.
Jon: THANK YOU.
IF TED CRUZ IS THE LEADER OF CONSERVATISIM, YOU ARE THE LEADER OF LIBERALS. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THEORY OF WHAT OBAMA WANTED TO DO. WHE WANTED TO GET A COMPROMISE BETWEEN A CANADIAN SYSTEM ON THE ONE HAND AND THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY BUT INSTEAD WHAT HE DID WAS CREATED A HUGE REFORM OF EVERYTHING. I USED TO BE A DOCTOR. I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WORK INSIDE. I KNOW HOW COMPLICATED IS THE ECOSYSTEM OF MEDICINE. TRILLIONS OF DECISIONS EVERY DAY. EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THAT IS UNDER NEW REGULATIONS. AS ONE SIDE EFFECT OF THIS REFORM WHICH YOU SAY IS ONLY AIMED AT THE UNINSURED. IT'S NOT. IF IT IS ONLY AIMED AT THE UNINSURED, WHY IS IT THAT RESTAURANTS ARE REDUCING THE HOURS OF WORKERS TO GET UNDER THE 30 HOUR LIMIT WHICH IS ARBITRARY CREATED BY OBAMACARE WHICH IS HURTING PEOPLE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS, LOSING INCOME AND LOSING HEALTH INSURANCE. THERE WAS NO REASON TO INVADE THE WHOLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND TO REMAKE IT IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS AND JUSTICE.
Jon: I THINK IT'S EASY IN HINDSIGHT TO SAY HE COULD HAVE JUST DONE THIS OR THAT BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT HAVE THEY PRESENTED? THEY SAY THE FREE MARKET WILL TAKE CARE OF ALL HAVE A LITTLE TORT REFORM WHICH IS 1% OF MEDICAL SYSTEM, LET PEOPLE SHOP ACROSS STATE LINES FOR A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND STATES LIKE NEW YORK WILL BE STUCK WITH GIANT POOLS OF PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. THEY ASKED TED CRUZ ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE THEN, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS? YOU MEAN PRESIDENT TED CRUZ?
HE'S ALREADY PRESIDENT.
Jon: IF YOU HAD A PRIMARY TOMORROW FOR THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, I REALLY BELIEVE TED CRUZ WOULD BE THE RUN AWAY WINNER SO TO PAINT HIM AS THOUGH HE IS ALAN GRAYSON AND OFF ON THE SIDE LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.
I RESPECT HIM. I RESPECT THE PASSION WITH WHICH HE BELIEVES AND WHAT HE BELIEVES. I DISAGREE OVER HIS TACTICS BUT I THINK IT'S EASY TO PORTRAY HIM AS A SPOKESMAN FOR A MOVEMENT THAT PREDATES HIM. YOU SAY IN RETROSPECT I'M ATTACKING OBAMACARE. EVERYTHING I SAID TO YOU ABOUT ALL THIS WAS AT THE TIME.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE ALTERNATIVE WAS NOT -- WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST INCREASE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID? ALL THE REPUBLICANS SAID IS THE FREE MARKET. WE BELIEVE IN FREE PEOPLES AND FREE MARKETS. WELL THESE SYSTEMS WERE CREATED BECAUSE FREE PEOPLES AND FREE MARKETS SOMETIMES IN SYSTEMS LIKE HEALTH CARE CREATE EXTERNALITIES THAT DON'T HELP PEOPLE AND SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE.
LOOK.
THE RYAN PLAN WHICH WOULD HAVE REFORMED MEDICARE IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION WHEN GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO DO EVERYTHING IT SCREWS UP. YOU KNOW. THAT YOU WERE HERE IN SEBELIUS EARLIER IN THE WEEK. THEY SCREWED UP A WEB SITE FOR GOD SAKE. YOU CAN'T MAKE A WEB SITE. I'LL GET YOU A 12-YEAR-OLD WHO WILL DO A WEB SITE. THEY SAID $600 MILLION TO DO THE WEB SITE. I'LL GIVE THE 12-YEAR-OLD $100 AND HE WILL DO IT IN THREE HOURS. THIS IS ABSURD. THE ARGUMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE RYANS IS YOU GIVE IT ALL OVER TO GOVERNMENT AND IT'S SCREWED UP.
IT'S NOT GIVEN TO GOVERNMENT. THEY JUST CREATED A NEW STANDARD OF INSURANCE AND OPENED IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL. WHY DID INSURANCE COMPANIES SUPPORT THIS IF IT'S GIVING IT TO GOVERNMENT? THEY STAND TO MAKE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY.
THE INSURERS HAVE LOST ALL THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY WITH THE POWER OF WHAT THE UTILITY COMPANIES ARE. THE GOVERNMENT WRITES THE RULES AND THEY IMPLEMENT AND GET A CUT. THAT'S IT. THIS ISN'T A CONSPIRACY OF INSURERS. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT BY PEOPLE WHO THINK IF YOU GET ENOUGH EXPERTS IN THE ROOM, THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST AND YOU SAY YOU OUGHT TO GET THEM AT THE BEGINNING AND NOT THREE WEEKS IN, THREE YEARS IN, YOU COULD WRITE REGULATIONS FOR A SYSTEM COMPLICATED LIKE HEALTH CARE AND IT WILL WORK. WE'RE SEEING IT DOESN'T WORK AND THE IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE WORSE. EVEN YOU GET PAST THIS.
Jon: EVEN YOU SAID MEDICARE IS A GREAT PROGRAM IT'S MORE ONEROUS THAN THIS IS.
YOU CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND EXPENSE. YOU HAVE TO REINTRODUCE INTO IT THE COMPETITION THAT IS IN THE RYAN PLAN AND IS NOT IN ANY OF THE OBAMA PLANS. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU STATED SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU SAY HOW CAN THEY THINK THAT GOVERNMENT HAS AN ANSWER TO THESE SOCIAL ILLS. YOU JUST QUOTED TWO OF THEM THAT ARE THE BEDROCK OF OUR SOCIETY.
THEY ARE DISCREET ISSUES.
Jon: MEDICARE IS THE SAME.
THEY ARE NOT REMAKING 1/6 OF THE ECONOMY.
Jon: WHAT PERCENT IS OKAY?
100% IS WRONG. AND THAT'S? WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH HEALTH CARE.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE WE DISAGREE ON THIS ULTIMATELY. YOU HAVE TO GET MY BOOK BECAUSE IT HAS ALL -- [LAUGHTER] I HAVE TO WRITE A BOOK NOW. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY AND HAVING A CONVERSATION. I TRULY ENJOYED IT. THINGS THAT MATTER. IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. BUY IT.
