Jon: THANK YOU MUCH!   TRANSPARENCY, OPENNESS, OPEN  LINES OF COMMUNICATION, THEY ARE  NOT JUST PHRASES YOU VAGUELY HEAR YOUR WIFE SAY WHILE YOU ARE  TRYING TO WATCH THE GIANTS GAME. ALSO IMPORTANT HALLMARKS OF  PROFESSIONAL ADMINISTRATION AND  THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR  INSTALLMENT OF OUR NEW SERIES, DO YOU GUYS EVER TALK TO EACH  OTHER?
TONIGHT'S TOPIC, THE  TERRORIST ATTACK, ON THE U.S. EMBASSY IN LIBYA THAT KILLED  FOUR AMERICANS, INCLUDING OUR  AMBASSADOR TO LIBYA.
WHITE HOUSE WAS STILL IN FACT  FINDING MODE.
I AM TELLING YOU THIS IS  UNDER INVESTIGATION, AN ONGOING  INVESTIGATION.
Jon: THAT IS GOOD THINKING. ALTHOUGH IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE  WE DID ESTABLISH A HUNCH.
WE HAVE NO INFORMATION TO  SUGGEST THAT IT WAS A PREPLANNED  ATTACK. THE UNREST WE HAVE SEEN AROUND  THE REGION HAS BEEN IN REACTION  TO A VIDEO.
Jon: YEAH. CRAPPY MOHAMMED MOVIE. THINGS LIKE THE RING. THREE DAYS AFTER YOU WATCH IT,  EMBASSIES JUST BURST INTO  FLAMES. SO YOUR ADMINISTRATION STORY IS  ONE ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO ON YOUTUBE  TOUCHED OFF THE MASSIVE PROTEST  ES ON SEPTEMBER 11TH AND SPREAD QUICK THROW 27 OTHER PLACES.
SEEMS IMPLAUSIBLE BUT AFTER  CARNEY'S PRESS CONFERENCE HE HAD  AN EXPLANATION FOR THAT.
OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT  ASSESSMENT IS WHAT HAPPENED IN  BENGHAZI WAS IN FACT INITIALLY A  SPONTANEOUS REACTION TO WHAT HAD JUST TRANSPIRED HOURS BEFORE IN  CAIRO, ALMOST A COPY CAT OF THE  DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST OUR  FACILITY IN CAIRO, WHICH WERE PROMPTED, OF COURSE, BY THE  VIDEO.
Jon: COPYCAT!  SO LIBYA  WASN'T THE RING, IT WAS THE RING  2. SO FIVE DAYS AFTER THE ATTACKS  THE WHITE HOUSE WAS STILL  THINKING ON THE VIDEO STORE.
THE NATIONAL TERRORIST CENTER  WENT IN FRONG OF CONTINUE, IN  FRONT OF CONGRESS WITH A  SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT.
I WOULD SAY, YES, THEY WERE  KILLED IN THE COURSE OF A  TERRORIST ATTACK ON OUR EMBASSY.
Jon: OF COURSE, HE WOULD  SAY IT IS A TERRORIST ATTACK, HE  RUNS THE COUNTER-TERRORISM  CENTER, HE THINKS EVERYTHING IS TERROR, IF YOU ASKS GHOST  BUSTERS THEY WOULD BLAME GHOSTS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?  IF YOU  ASKED THE FOO FIGHTERS THEY  WOULD PROBABLY BLAME IT ON FOO.
ANYWAY, THE GENTLEMAN HAD  COMPANY IN MAKING THAT  ASSESSMENT.
I THINK IT IS SELF EVIDENCE  WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI WAS A  TERRORIST ATTACK.
Jon: OH. HOW BAD DOES IT SUCK TO BE THE  WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. HEY TELL THEM AMOUNT THE VIDEO.
OKAY. GET OUT THERE AND TELL THEM IT  WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK.
OKAY.
Jon: NOT TO MENTION JUDGING  BY THE SOUND OF THAT VIDEO,  APPARENTLY THEY MAKE HIM STAND  AT A VERY SPECIAL PLACE WHILE ANSWERING QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT?  IT IS NOT SO  WEIRD. IT STARTED OUT THE  ADMINISTRATION WASN'T QUITE SURE  WHAT HAPPENED. THEY MADE A COUPLE OF STATEMENTS  WHICH LATER THEY WANTED TO TAKE  BACK AND BY DAY EIGHT, THEY WERE  VERY CLEAR THAT THIS WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK, SO THE  PRESIDENT SPOKESMAN SAID IT IS A  TERRORIST ATTACK. CUT TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE  UNITED STATES JUST THREE HOURS  LATER.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO  SOMETHING UNTIL WE HAVE ALL OF  THE INFORMATION. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE  NATURAL PROTESTS THAT AROSE  BECAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE OVER THE  VIDEO WERE USED AS AN EXCUSE BY EXTREMISTS TO SEE IF THEY CAN  ALSO DIRECTLY HARM U.S. INTERESTS.
Jon: SO DO YOU GUYS TALK TO  EACH OTHER OR -- I MEAN, FOR  GOD'S SAKE HILLARY CLINTON GOT  THE MEMO.
WHAT HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI WAS  A TERRORIST ATTACK.
Jon: SO LET'S TRY AGAIN IN  A SAFER SPACE.
I HEARD HILLARY CLINTON SAY  THAT IT WAS AN ACT OF TERRORISM. IS IT?  WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WELL, WE ARE STILL DOING AN  INVESTIGATION. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE KIND  OF WEAPONS THAT WERE USED, THE  ONGOING ASSAULT THAT IT WASN'T  JUST A MOB ACTION.
Jon: AND?  AND IF IT WASN'T  JUST A MOB ACTION BUT NOT AN ACT  OF TERRORISM EITHER, WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE?  WHAT, LIBYAN ST. PATRICK'S DAY?  WHAT IS GOING  ON?  A QUINCEANERA THAT GOT OUT  OF HAND?  NOW A CYNIC WOULD  ARGUE HE IS UNWILLING TO ADMIT THE EMBASSY WAS HIT BY  TERRORISTS BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE  HIM LOOK BACK. BUT MAYBE IT IS HONEST  CONFUSION, MAYBE IT IS HONEST  CONFUSION AND IT TOOK A WEEK TO  FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN  LIBYA.
OUR SOURCES TELL US THEY KNEW  WITHIN 24 HOURS THIS WAS A  TERROR ATTACK.
Jon: (BLEEP)!  WELL, TWO  THINGS APPARENTLY HAVE BECOME  CLEAR, THE ATTACK ON OUR EMBASSY  WAS PLANNED AND COORDINATED, THE RESPONSE TO IT, NOT SO MUCH. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
