Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST  TONIGHT ACADEMY AWARD WINNING  ACTOR, HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED "STAND-UP GUYS."
YOU DID YOUR TIME LIKE A MAN,  PAL. YOU WERE STAND-UP ALL THE WAY.
YOU AND DOC WOULD HAVE DONE  THE SAME.
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO IT'S  POSSIBLE. EITHER WAY IS POSSIBLE BUT YOU  DID THIS. TRUE. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS DIDN'T  WORK TOGETHER ALL THIS TIME.
NO, NO. THAT WAS THAT.
AND IT WAS.
HE CAN'T FORGIVE HIMSELF SO  EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GOT TO PAY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WHILE  YOU ARE OUT, PAL?
I ALWAYS WANTED TO FINISH  HIGH SCHOOL.
Jon: HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO  BET THE BLINKER WAS ON THE WHOLE  TIME THEY WERE DRIVING? PLEASE WE WILL -- WELCOME BACK  TO THE SHOW CHRISTOPHER WALKEN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.
Jon: JUST THAT ONE SCENE,  THE SIMPLEST OF SCENES, THE  SIMPLEST OF THE TASKS, DRIVING IN A CAR DOWN A STREET, YOU,  PACINO, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW  MANY PEOPLE WANT TO BE IN THAT  CAR?
IT'S TRUE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW, THESE SCENES TAKE A  LONG TIME AND WE WERE IN -- WHEN  YOU ARE DOING A SHOT IN A CAR, YOU ARE ON A FLATBED AND YOU ARE  GOING AND YOU SPEND A LOT OF  TIME JUST SITTING IN THE TRUCK. THAT WAS REALLY THE BEST PART.
Jon: GETTING TO HANG OUT  WITH THOSE GUYS. WHO IS THE CHATTIEST AMONGST  YOU? WOULD YOU IT BE ARKI IN THE  CHATTIEST?
ARKIN IS CHATTY. YOU MIGHT NOT SUSPECT THAT AL  WAS CHATTY BUT HE IS.
Jon: I WITH NOT SUSPECT  THAT.
YES. AND I'M PRETTY CHATTY SO --
Jon: YOU COULD SEE THAT. I COULD SEE THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] WOULD IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN  YOU WERE SITTING IN DIFFERENT  POSITIONS IN THE CAR BECAUSE I ALWAYS FIND A BACKSEAT. YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IBT  RUPTED. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE BACKSEAT OF  A CAR AND THEY CAN HAVE A NICE  CONVERSATION AND YOU ARE LIKE, SHOULD WE GET SOME FOOD. IT'S HARD.
IN THE MOVIES THE BACKSEAT IS  A GOOD THING.
Jon: IT IS A GOOD THING. IN MOST CAR SCENES THAT CUT THEY  DO THAT. THEY ALWAYS DO THIS, THEY LOOK  AHEAD AND GO -- VERY RARELY DO  THEY LOOK BACK. IN CAR SCENES A LOT OF THE TIMES  THEY ARE DOING THIS AND THEN -- [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY DO THAT WAY TOO LONG.
Jon: AND NOBODY WOULD EVER  DO THAT IN A CAR.
WOULD YOU BE IN BIG TROUBLE.
Jon: HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO  DO THIS IN A MANY OFY. WHEN I WATCH MOVIES IT'S A SMALL  PET PEEVE AND SOMEONE SAYS GIVE  ME YOUR NUMBER AND THEY SAY, SURE, 555 -- AND THEY GIVE YOU A  MOVIE NUMBER THAT IS NOT REAL.
THEY SHOULD GIVE YOU A NUMBER  THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY CALLED IT  WOULD BE SOMETHING.
Jon: AS SOON AS YOU SAY  555-EVERYBODY SAYS I'M LEAVING.
WHAT IF YOU CALLED IT AND  THEY WERE THERE.
Jon: GAVE YOUR REAL NUMBER.
DO THAT IN THE AD.
Jon: YOU ARE A TOUGH GUY TO  GET AHOLD OF? ARE YOU A TECHNO-FILE? ARE YOU ONLINE?
NO, I MISSED ALL THAT.
Jon: IT'S STILL HERE, YOU  CAN JUMP ON THAT.
I REMEMBER WHEN TRANSISTER  RADIOS HAPPENED.
Jon: DID YOU JUMP ON THAT  YET? ARE YOU WAITING?
IT'S LIKE THAT. I REMEMBER --
Jon: YOU REALLY --
WHEN I WAS A KID YOU HAD TO  BE ABLE TO ADD AND SUBTRACT.
Jon: WHAT? WHY?
EXACTLY.
Jon: ARE YOU SAYING YOU  DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER?
NO.
Jon: FOR REAL?
NO, I DON'T. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I QUESTION -- A  QUESTION POPPED IN MY HEAD THAT  I CAN'T BECAUSE OF HOW INAPPROPRIATE IT IS.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER  YOU DON'T HAVE A CERTAIN KIND OF  IDENTITY. YOU DON'T HAVE A FOOTPRINT IN  THE CLOUDS OR --
Jon: RIGHT. DO YOU FEEL AMISH? LIKE DO YOU FEEL -- DO YOU FEEL  THAT YOU DON'T -- LIKE  INFORMATION HOW DO YOU GET IT? PURELY STILL PAPER?
MY WIFE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DOES SHE HAVE A  COMPUTER?
IF I NEED SOMETHING I'LL ASK  HER. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S INTERESTING I DON'T HAVE A  CELL PHONE EITHER.
Jon: NO!
BUT WHEN I MAKE A MOVIE THEY  HAND ME ONE. AND I ALWAYS THINK THAT'S NICE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT FOR ME. IT'S SO THEY CAN GET ME.
Jon: FIND YOU. WHY NOT LIKE A CAT GIVE YOU A  LITTLE BELL. THAT IS WILD. THEY HAND YOU A CELL PHONE. AT THE END OF THE FILM DO THEY  GO --
TAKE IT BACK.
Jon: WHEN YOU HAVE ONE, IS  IT FUN TO HAVE?
IT IS. I CALL PEOPLE BACK. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WELL, I KNOW WHAT I'M  GETTING YOU FOR CHRISTMAS.
I CALL PEOPLE THAT I NEVER  TALK TO. I JUST CALL THEM.
Jon: THAT MAY BE THE  FAVORITE THING I'VE HEARD IN THE  LONGEST TIME. "STAND-UP GUYS" IS IN THE  THEATERS ON FEBRUARY 1.
