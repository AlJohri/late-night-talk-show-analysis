>>FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART! >
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. RON SUSKIND. MY GUEST TONIGHT: RON SUSKIND, AUTHOR OF "LIFE ANIMATED." HE'S THE AUTHOR OF "LIFE ANIMATED: A STORY OF SIDEKICKS, HEROES AND AUTISM." RON SUSKIND. HE'LL BE OUR GUEST. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING. BUT I HAVE TO  TURN TO THE TROUBLING STATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY WHICH, HAVING HIT SOME TOUGH TIMES, OUR DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO SELL ITS BODY TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
THE KOCH BROTHERS, THE INDUSTRIAL MAGNATES CURRENTLY TIED FOR FOURTH ON FORBES LIST OF RICHEST AMERICANS WITH $36 BILLION A PIECE. IN 2012, THE KOCH BROTHERS POLITICAL NETWORK RAISED $400 MILLION TO SUPPORT CONSERVATIVE CAUSES.
RAISED -- RAISED -- FOUND -- FOUND IN THE KOCH BROTHERS CONSERVATIVE CLUB HOUSE COUCH CUSHIONS IS PROBABLY -- BY THE WAY -- THAT CLUB, EACH WORD SPELLED WITH A KAY. FOR $400 MILLION COULDN'T YOU BUY YOUR OWN DAMN COUNTRY? YOU COULD RULE IT ANY WAY YOU WANT. NO PANTS TUESDAYS? YOU COULD BE DONE! THANKFULLY, ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS PUTTING HIS FOOT DOWN AND HIS DUKES UP.
THE TOP DEMOCRAT IN THE U.S. SENATE, MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID, HAS NOW MENTIONED THE BILLIONAIRE KOCH BROTHERS THIS YEAR MORE THAN 140 TIMES.
THEY ARE IN IT TO MAKE MONEY. AN ATTEMPT TO BUY OUR DEMOCRACY IS DISHONEST, DECEPTIVE FALSE AND UNFAIR.
IT IS WRONG, INCORRECT, ERRONEOUS, WORTHY OF CORRECTION. THAT'S WHERE EVEN THE THESAURUS RUNS OUT OF WAYS TO SAY (BLEEP). LISTEN, BECAUSE THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE IN THE FOSSIL FUEL BUSINESS THEIR MONEY CAN'T HELP BUT POLLUTE THE DEBATE.
EVEN THE KEYSTONE DEBATE, MR. PRESIDENT. THEY'RE ONE OF THE MAIN OWNERS OF ALL THAT 'STUFF' UP THERE. THAT UGLY TAR STUFF. IN CANADA. THEY ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST IF NOT THE SECOND LARGEST OWNER OF THAT STUFF UP THERE. (LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, IN THE HISTORY OF THE SENATE, THERE HAVE BEEN MANY GREAT AND NOTABLE ORATORS, AND I TRULY BELIEVE HARRY REID'S VOTE AGAINST THE "STUFF UP THERE," KEYSTONE TUBE DEALEY, WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY OF THE PAPER READY THINGIES THAT ARE ORDERED ON THE -- THE -- I'M GONNA SAY SHELVE-A-MA-JIGS. BRING IT HOME, DANIEL WEBSTER!
SENATE REPUBLICANS, MADAM PRESIDENT, ARE ADDICTED TO KOCH.
YOU MIGHT SAY -- YOU MIGHT SAY, YOU MIGHT SAY MADAM PRESIDENT, THAT THEIR ADDICTION TO KOCH IS MATCHED ONLY BY THEIR INSATIABLE LOVE OF DICK. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT A REPUBLICAN UTOPIA WOULD CONSIST OF NOTHING BUT KOCH AND DICK, KOCH AND DICK, DICK AND KOCH. THAT IS HARRY REID, SENATOR HARRY REID, CRUSADER FOR GOOD MONEY FREE POLITICS.
MANY PEOPLE NOTED HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPENT ON THE SENATE FLOOR TALKING ABOUT THE KOCH BROTHERS, BUT WHAT MAKES THEM WORSE THAN SAY SHELDON ADLESON.
OH SNAP, HARRY REID IS GONNA DROP THAT QUESTION LIKE A 50-POUND SACK OF -- DIRT, ROOT STARCHY THINGIES. SHELDON ADELSON, ARCH CONSERVATIVE IN REID'S HOME STATE. THE OWNER OF LAS VEGAS SANDS CORPORATION, THE COUNTRY'S SINGLE BIGGEST CASINO COMPANY, INCLUDING THE VEGAS STRIP'S ONLY NON-UNION CASINO. THIS GUY'S SPENT MILLIONS FIGHTING TO OUTLAW ONLINE GAMBLING. TENS OF MILLIONS FIGHTING ORGANIZED LABOR, IN THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HE GAVE $90 MILLION TO REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. PERHAPS BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THEY'D HELP HIM TAKE ON, QUOTE THE TWO MOST FUNDAMENTAL THREATS TO SOCIETY, NAMELY "RADICAL ISLAM," AND "UNIONS. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. UNIONIZING WITHOUT SECRET VOTING IS SHELDON ADLESON'S PERSONAL 9/11. HARRY REID IS GOING TO CRUSH THIS GUY.
SHELDON ADELSON, DON'T PICK ON HIM.
WAIT, WHAT? SORRY THERE, WHAT DID YOU SAY THERE? DON'T PICK ON THE BILLIONAIRE WHO PUTS MONEY IN POLITICS, WHY?
I KNOW SHELDON ADELSON. HE'S NOT IN THIS FOR MONEY. HE'S IN IT BECAUSE HE HAS CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS. (LAUGHTER) WHAT THE (BLEEP) DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? HE'S GOT IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS. IF THOSE HAPPEN TO LINE UP WITH THE MONEY, MAZEL TOV. ALL I'M SAYING IS, LOOK, WELL WHAT ARE HIS IDEOLOGICAL OBJECTIONS TO ONLINE GAMBLING THAT THE LARGEST OWNER OF IN HOUSE CASINO GAMBLING HAS?
I CAN'T TELL OVER THE INTERNET WHO IS UNDER AGE. I CAN'T TELL WHO'S GOT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. I CAN'T TELL WHO IS -- WHO IS NOT GAMING RESPONSIBLY.
BUT IF YOU COME TO MY CASINO -- (LAUGHTER) -- IF YOU COME TO MY CASINO, YOU DON'T ENTER WITHOUT ANSWERING A VERY DETAILED FINANCIAL SOLVENCY QUESTIONNAIRE, OF COURSE ASSUMING YOU EVEN DECIDE TO COME IN AFTER SEEING MY CASINO SLOGAN. FOR MORE WE GO TO SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES. JASON! JASON, ISN'T IT -- LET ME SAY THIS -- ISN'T IT HYPOCRITICAL FOR HARRY REID TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHELDON ADELSON'S MONEY AND THE KOCH BROTHERS?
NO.  (LAUGHTER)
DO YOU WANT TO EXPAND ON THAT?
NOT REALLY. IT'S SELF-EVIDENT.
WHY?
BECAUSE SHELDON ADELSON'S MONEY AND POWER HELP HARRY REID. THE KOCH BROTHERS' MONEY AND POWER DON'T. SO THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE CORRUPT. PRETTY SIMPLE CONCEPT TO GRASP THERE, JON.
BUT, YOU'RE SAYING THE EFFECT THE MONEY HAS ON HARRY REID DETERMINES WHETHER THE MONEY IS CORRUPT OR NOT?
YES. LOOK, MAYBE SOME VISUAL AIDS WILL HELP YOUR DUMB BRAIN PROCESS.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, HERE IS THE POLLUTED PILES OF INFLUENCED GREENBACKS THAT THE KOCH BROTHERS SMEAR ACROSS OUR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, OKAY?
OKAY. NOW, HERE IS THE MAJESTIC TOWERS OF LIBERTY BUCKS THAT SHELDON ADELSON SPRAYS LIKE THE SWEET PERFUME OF FREEDOM ON THE TAUT, SLENDER NAPE OF OUR NATION'S NECK. (LAUGHTER)
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH AMERICA.
WHAT RIGHT-THINKING CITIZEN DOESN'T?
LISTEN THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SACKS!
YES, YES THERE IS. THIS SACK IS OWNED BY A GUY WHO'S THE BIGGEST POWER BROKER IN HARRY REID'S STATE! GOD, YOU ARE ALMOST COMICALLY DIM-WITTED!
SO, SO WHAT IS CORRUPTION?
CORRUPTION IS A BILLIONAIRE WHO SPENDS THEIR MONEY ON (BLEEP) YOU DON'T LIKE!
WHAT IS FREE SPEECH?
A BILLIONAIRE WHO SPENDS MONEY ON (BLEEP) YOU DO LIKE!
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A DEMOCRACY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE LIVING IN AN OLIGARCHY.
NO, RUSSIA IS AN OLIGARCHY.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
AN OLIGARCHY IS RUN BY BILLIONAIRES WHO AREN'T AMERICANS!
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. JASON. JASON JONES, EVERYBODY! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
