[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS WE LEARNED IN THE LAST SEGMENT, NO ONE WHO COMMITS THESE FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL DEALS AND CORPORATION THINGS GOES TO JAIL WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING ILLEGAL. DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY ALSO DO NOT GO TO JAIL FOR DOING THINGS THAT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL BUT FOR SOME REASON ARE NOT AT ALL ILLEGAL. IT'S TRUE. CASE IN POINT. A FEW WEEKS AGO BLOOMBERG NEWS BROKE AN UNBELIEVABLE STORY. IT'S A TALE OF TWO COMPANIES FIRST BLACKSTONE THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT SHOULD BE AN EVIL WIZARDS CASTLE BUT ACTUALLY A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM. SO SAME DEAL. THE SECOND COMPANY CODERE THAT RUNS BETTING PARLORS AND RACE TRACKS ALL OVER EUROPE. CLASSY. EARLY THIS YEAR BLACKSTONE BOUGHT SOMETHING CALLED A CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP ON DEBT THAT CODERE OWED TO A THIRD PARTY WHICH MEANS BLACKSTONE WOULD MAKE MONEY IF CODERE BLEW A LOAN PAYMENT TO THE OTHER GUYS. THEN A SHORT TIME LATER BLACKSTONE OFFERED CODERE A $100 MILLION WITH THE CONDITION THAT THEY PAY THE OTHER LOAN TO THE OTHER COMPANY LATE. THE LOAN BLACKSTONE HAD ALREADY BET THEY WOULD PAY LATE. BLACKSTONE BACKS THEM AND THEY PAY LATE. THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP IS TRIGGERED AND BLACKSTONE COLLECTS $15 MILLION IN INSURANCE MONEY. I'M SURE YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELF HEY I THINK I SAW THAT IN GOODFELLAS WHEN THEY GET INSURANCE ON A RESTAURANT AND DELIBERATELY BLOW THE RESTAURANT UP. IN GOODFELLAS IT'S ILLEGAL. IN THE FINANCIAL WORLD IT'S ABOVE BOARD. FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE. SAM, THIS IS INSANE. SO WHEN A DEAL LIKE THIS GOES DOWN. HOW MUCH COVERAGE HAS THIS INCREDIBLY EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR GOTTEN ON THE 24 HOUR NEWS NETWORKS?
ZERO.
Jon: NOTHING?
WAIT THERE WAS UM, NOTHING.
Jon: REALLY? 600 TELEVISION CHANNELS THREE 24 HOUR NEWS NETWORKS.
AND NO STORIES BUT IT'S (bleep) CRAZY. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT. WHAT BLACKSTONE DID WAS CLEARLY A HUGE STORY BUT THE BUSINESS NETWORKS EAGER YOUNG REPORTERS HAVE BETTER THINGS TO EXPLAIN. I WENT TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES" THE PAPER OF RECORD TO FIND OUT WHY ALL THOSE TV (bleep) WOULDN'T COVER IT. THIS IS A COMPLEX STORY AND IT TAKES A LOT TO UNPACK IT. TATHERE'S SORT OF A RULE THAT IF YOU  CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IN TEN SECONDS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY WANT TO COVER.
I TAKE IT AS A CHALLENGE AND --
CAN I JUST LAY OUT THE FACTS.
TEN SECONDS. GO.
BLACKSTONE LOANED MONEY TO A SPANISH GAMBLING PARLOR COMPANY. THEY BOUGHT INSURANCE.
TIME IS UP. THAT WAS TERRIBLE LET ME TRY. RICH (bleep) WANT ALL THE MONEY FOR THEMSELVES. I HAVE SEVEN SECONDS LEFT. BABA BOOEY. BABA BOY. DONE. LIUCKILY THEY WERE WILLING TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON BLACKSTONE'S MALFEASANCE. THIS IS A HUGE STORY HOW DOES THE "NEW YORK TIMES" COVER IT?
"NEW YORK TIMES" DIDN'T COVER IT. WHY, WHY DIDN'T YOU COVER THE STORY?
WE'RE BUSIER THAN ONE ARMED PAPER HANGERS COVERING THE MISCREANTS THAT WE IDENTIFY. THIS IS ANOTHER DAY ON WALL STREET.
A FRONT PAGE STORY WOULD BE HEDGE FUND WITH EVIL SOUNDING NAME DIDN'T DO ANYTHINGUNDING TERRIBLE TODAY.
I'M DROWNING IN MATERIAL.
WOULD YOU COVER IT IF WE SNUCK IT INTO A GAY WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT.
NOT MY DEPARTMENT.
I GUESS THEY ARE TOO BUSY RUNNING STORIES ON POOP FACIALS. IF TV AND PAPERS DIDN'T HAVE THE STONES FOR IT MAYBE THE WEBE THE WOULD. SOMEBODY TELL CHRIS BROWN TO PUNCH BLACKSTONE OR I'LL GO TO THE PROS. PITCH ME YOUR BEST IDEAS. I NEED THEM TO BE TWERK AND MOSTLY I NEED THEM TO BE AMAZEBALLS. YOU NERD GO.
I FEEL LIKE ANY TIME WE GET THE CHANCE TO USE A CRAZY NICHOLAS CAGE PHOTO IN A POST.
I LOVE THAT ALREADY.
WHAT THEY DID WAS LIKE THE PLOT OF SAW.
I LIKE IT IT'S DARK.
LIKE DISNEY PRINCESSES DISNEY PRINCESSES EXPLAIN THE BLACKSTONE STORY.
FULL OF GREAT IDEAS. HOW ABOUT THE BLACKSTONE CREDIT DEFAULT DEAL IS JUST LIKE ROSS AND RACHEL FROM FRIENDS.
OH, MY GOD I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE. WHY NOT DO A POST ABOUT JOANIE AND CACHIE. THEY WEREN'T GETTING IT. WHAT I NEEDED WAS A LOCAL NEWSMAN, CATASTROPHIC WEATHER AND THIS STORY WOULD BE EVERY WHERE. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME OVER THE STORM. BLACKSTONE LOANED A $100 MILLION TO A STRUGGLING SPANISH COMPANY CODERE. WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING IS THAT THEY WANTED CODERE TO DEFAULT ON THE LOAN... THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
YOU ARE SELLING IT. GET BACK HERE. YOU KNOW YOU WANT THIS.
ALL RIGHT TIME TO GO VIRAL. COMMENCING YOUTUBE DEF-CON1. GET IN HERE AND DO SOMETHING ADORABLE NOW. GO. OKAY THE KITTENS ARE NOT LISTENING TO ME. I HAD TRIED ALMOST EVERYTHING. HEY, HOW DO YOU LOSE PAGE VIEWS? THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN KITTENS. ♪ I CAME IN WRECKING BALL
EXCEPT FOR THIS. I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO [. ♪  BLACKSTONE LOANED MONEY TO THIS OTHER COMPANY CALLED CODERE AND GOT THEM TO PURPOSELY MISS A DEBT PAYMENT TRIGGERING A CREDIT EVENT SO BLACKSTONE COULD CASH IN ON A CREDIT DEFAULT LOAN THEY MADE BETTING THEY WOULD DEFAULT. BLACKSTONE NETTED $15 MILLION OUCH. AND IT WAS TOTALLY LEGAL AND THESE ARE THE KIND OF SHADY DEALS THAT GOT US INTO THE RECESSION INTO THE FIRST PLACE. ARE YOU LISTENING NOW? IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED? DRINK IT IN (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE.
