( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. FLEISS TO SEE YOU. TONIGHT, THIS IS OUR FINAL SHOW. WE HAVE NEXT WEEK OFF. AS YOU KNOW, NEXT WEEK IS THANKSGIVING. HERE ARE SOME THOUGHT ON THE HOLIDAY. WE HAVE AN AUTHOR OF NOTSZ, WOMAN OF LETTERS. PLEASE WELCOME OUR NEW SENIOR HISTORICAL CONTEXT CORRESPONDENT, SARAH VOWELL. SARAH VOWELL, NICE TO SEE YOU ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT  TH-- HAPPY THINGS.
TAKE THAT BACK, STEWART.
Jon:  WHAT? TAKE IT BACK! WHY?
THANKSGIVING IS SUCH AN INTERIOR HOLIDAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A MUCH BETTER ONE  THE DAY AFTER-- MORE STIRRING, MORE INSPIRATIONAL. IT IS CALLED EVACUATION DAY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  THAT'S A LITTLE CRASS, DON'T YOU THINK? I MEAN, YOU'RE ON NPR. I KNOW PEOPLE EAT TURKEY AND RICH FOODS, BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT--
EVACUATION DAY COMMEMORATES THE LAST BRITISH TROOPS FLEEING MANHATTAN AT THE END OF THE  REVOLUTIONARY WAR IN 1783.
Jon:  SEE, I THOUGHT THAT WAS IN-- IN '97.
NO, WE SIGNED THE TREATY OF PARIS IN SEPTEMBER OF '83.
Jon:  WAS THAT 18 OR 17?
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH JULY 4, 1776?
Jon:  YES, I AM (  LAUGHTER  ) THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE!
THAT'S RIGHT, TIMMY. ( LAUGHTER ) BUT YOU KNOW THE WAR DIDN'T ALL TAKE PLACE ON THAT ONE DAY. IT STARTED BEFORE THAT, AND WE FOUGHT THE REDCOATS FOR SEVEN MORE YEARS.
Jon:  YES, YES, YES. SO WHY WAS EVACUATION DAY SUCH A BIG DEAL?
WELL, AS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WAS BEING SIGNED, 400 SHIPS FULL OF BIG, BAD LIMEY BASTARDS STARTED SHOWING UP IN NEW YORK HARBOR TO CRUSH THE  PIDDLY LITTLE ARMY LED BY GEORGE WASHINGTON. WASHINGTON'S TROOPS WERE WHOOPED, EMBARRASSED, AND HUMILIATED UNTIL THEY RETREATED  TO NEW JERSEY IN SHAME. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE NEW JERSEY STATE MOTTO FOR A WHILE (  LAUGHTER  ).
WHAT WAS?
Jon:  RETREAT HERE IN SHAME. ( LAUGHTER ).
THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT YOU. INSTEAD OF THE FACT THAT THIS DEFEAT MEANT THAT THE BRITISH OCCUPIED OUR BELOVED NEW YORK  FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS.
Jon:  I'M SURE THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, PLEASANT ENOUGH OCCUPIERS, FAMOUS FOR THEIR HOSPITALITY. THEY HAD PUDDINGS, PIES.
THEY INCARCERATED THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN POWs IN THESE HEINOUS ROTTING PRISON SHIPS  ANCHORED THIS THE EAST RIVER. MORE AMERICAN SOLDIERS DIED IN THESE NEW YORK PRISONS THAN IN ALL BATTLES OF THE REVOLUTIONARY  WAR COMBINED. COMBINED.
Jon:  WELL, IT SOUND LIKE A LOVELY HOLIDAY. UHM-- SO INSTEAD OF THANKSGIVING YOU WANT AMERICANS TO CELEBRATE THE 18th CENTURY ABU GHRAIB.
NO! I WANT US TO CELEBRATE VICTORY WASHINGTON'S TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO THE CITY HE LOST. AMERICANS ARE ALWAYS SO EXCITED ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF A WAR. WHAT IF WE CELEBRATED HOW WE USED TO BE GOOD AT ENDING THEM ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, I'LL BITE. I'LL BITE. SO HOW-- HOW DO WE-- HOW DO WE CELEBRATE EVACUATION DAY?
WELL, THEY USED TO REENACT THE EVACUATION'S MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT-- WHEN A BRISON SHIP  SURVIVOR, JOHN VAN ARSDALE, CLIMBED A FLAG POLE, RIPPED DOWN THE DESPICABLE UNION JACK AND  PUT UP THE STARS STARS AND STRIPES TO THE CHEERS WILL OF THE CROWD! ( CHEERS ) THUS, LATER EVACUATION DAY SHINDIGS OFTEN INCLUDED POLE CLIMBING CONTESTS (  LAUGHTER  )
Jon:  WOW. I WONDER WHY THAT HOLIDAY EVER DIED OUT?
WELL YOU KNOW WHO I BLAME?
Jon:  I CAN ONLY ASSUME HITLER (  LAUGHTER  ).
NO, ABRAHAM ( BLEEP ) LINCOLN (  LAUGHTER  ).
Jon:  WHAT! LINCOLN! WHAT!
WHEN LINCOLN MADE THANKSGIVING A NATIONAL HOLIDAY, EVACUATION DAY ENDED UP LIKE ONE OF THOSE SHOWS SCHEDULED OPPOSITE "AMERICAN IDOL."  WE  STOPPED HONORING THE 11,000 LOYAL PATRIOTS WHO PERISHED ON THOSE BRITISH PRISON SHIPS. THEY WERE OFFERED FREEDOM IF THEY JUST SWORE ALIEGENCE TO THE CROWN, AND THEY REFUSED. YOU REMEMBER WHAT PATRICK HENRY SAID?
Jon:  YES. ( LAUGHTER ) MISSION ACCOMPLISHED? ( LAUGHTER ).
NO. "GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH." BUT YOU KNOW HOW HE DIED? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  HE'S DEAD? ( LAUGHTER ).
YEAH, YEAH, BUT HE DIED A QUARTER OF A CONCHRY LATER ON HIS FARM OF STOMACH CANCER. THESE PRISONERS, THEY LITERALLY CHOSE DEATH. SHOULDN'T WE THANK THEM INSTEAD OF SOME "MAYFLOWER" CRUISING  JESUS FREAK CORN RUSTLERS? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) DISPL YOU KNOW, SARAH, THANKSGIVING HAS A PARADE.
OH, YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE MACY'S EVACUATION DAY PARADE? ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  WHAT ARE THOSE BALLOONS BLOONS?
THOSE ARE INFLATABLE LICE. PRISONERS WERE SO HUNGRY, THEY WERE KNOWN TO SNACK ON THE LICE OFF THEIR SHIRTS.
Jon:  I'LL MAKE SURE TO GET MY KIDS DOWN THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE SO WE CAN WATCH THEM  IPFLAT THE LICE.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. JUST MAKE SURE THEY'RE HOME IN TIME TO WATCH THE PEANUT'S EVACUATION DAY SPECIAL.
CAN'T ANYONE TELL ME WHY EVACUATION DAY IS SO MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL THAN THANKSGIVING?
YOU BET, CHARLIE BROWN. EVACUATION DAY WAS A JOYFUL RELIEF FROM SEVEN LONG YEARS OF HELL. THOUSANDS OF PATRIOT CORPSES WERE BURIED IN MASS GRAVES SO SHALLOW, BODY PARTS CONTINUESED  TO WASH ASHORE THE NEXT 20 YEARS. IT CELEBRATES THE WEASLEY BRITS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HAPPY EVACUATION DAY, JON!
Jon:  HAPPY EVACUATION DAY, EVERYBODY. SARAH VOWELL. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
