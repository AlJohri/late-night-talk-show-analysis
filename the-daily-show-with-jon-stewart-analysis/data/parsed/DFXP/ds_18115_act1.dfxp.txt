John: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW" I AM JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART IS GONE FOR THE  SUMMER. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS BUT  SOMEONE GOT HIM PREGNANT. (LAUGHTER)  HE'S GONE TO A COMMUNITY FOR  OLDER THEN A SIMILAR SITUATION. (LAUGHTER)  OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE  MAGNIFICENT SINGER AND HUMAN  BEING MAVIS STAPLES IS HERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  MWAH! BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE  THE EVER-GROWING LIST OF  SCANDALS THAT HAS BEFALLEN THIS GREAT NATION. THERE WAS THE I.R.S. TARGETING  CONSERVATIVE GROUPS, THE D.O.J. SPYING ON JOURNALISTS, THE  N.S.A. CREEPING ON EVERYONE, AND  I ARE CENTLY G-O-D'S DECISION TO RUIN THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS. (LAUGHTER)  AND ON THE FOURTH DAY HE DID  ATTEMPT TO RUN UP THE MIDDLE AND  LO, HE WAS CRUSHED. (LAUGHTER)  AND THE LORD WAS SORE AMUSED. LET'S ALL AGREE. LET'S JUST ALL AGREE, WE ARE AT  PRECIPICE OF SCANDAL OVERLOAD  RIGHT NOW SO LET'S PLEASE JUST TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
AT THE RISK OF GIVING YOU  SCANDAL OVERLOAD, TONIGHT WE  HAVE A NEW ONE.
John: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! YOU'RE PUTTING ME IN A DIFFICULT  POSITION HERE! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EXPLAIN  THIS TO JON STEWART? "HEY, BOSS, YEAH, THE SHOW'S  GOING OKAY. ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK THE  COUNTRY MIGHT BE COMPLETELY  FALLING APART."  (LAUGHTER) AND, BY THE WAY, GOOD LUCK  TRACING A FINGER PHONE, N.S.A.! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  SO WHAT IS THIS NEW SCANDAL?
SOME OF THE STATE  DEPARTMENT'S OWN AGENTS ARE  CHARGING THAT INVESTIGATIONS WERE MANIPULATED TO PROTECT  CAREERS OR TO AVOID SCANDAL. AT LEAST ONE IS CHARGING WHEN  THEY INVESTIGATED A SERIES OF  COVERUPS IT WAS COVERED UP. (LAUGHTER)
John: WOW. SO A COVERUP OF A COVERUP OF A  SCANDAL! IT'S LIKE A TURDUCKEN OF LIES. (LAUGHTER)  THINK NEW SCANDAL SOUNDS  GRIEGING BUT IF THIS WAS ALREADY  TRIPLE COVERED UP, AGAIN, HOW DID WE FIND OUT ABOUT IT?
HE WAS AN INVESTIGATOR FOR  THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNAL  WATCHDOG AGENCY AND IS NOW A  WHISTLE-BLOWER.
YOU ARE KIDDING ME. ANOTHER WHISTLE-BLOWER. IT'S THE SECOND ONE IN A WEEK. IF YOU'RE A WHISTLE, THIS IS THE  WEEK THAT YOU ARE GETTING BLOWN! (LAUGHTER)  I'M NOT SURE THAT QUITE CAME OUT  RIGHT. IN FACT, I'M GOING TO GO OUT ON  A LIMB AND JUST CALL IT FOR ALL  OF US. WE ARE IN THE SUMMER OF THE  WHISTLE-BLOWER. (LAUGHTER)  SO WHAT IS THIS STATE DEPARTMENT  WHISTLE-BLOWER BLOWING THE  WHISTLE ON-- HE ASKS KNOWING THAT IT WOULD INVOLVE  PROSTITUTES.
ACCUSATIONS OF PROSTITUTES,  DRUG DEALS AND SEXUAL ABUSE NEAR  U.S. EMBASSIES. A U.S. AMBASSADOR SOLICITED  SEXUAL FAVORS FROM PROSTITUTES. A MEMBER OF HILLARY CLINTON'S  SECURITY ENGAGED PROSTITUTES  WHILE ON OFFICIAL TRIMS IN COLOMBIA AND RUSSIA.
CLINTON'S SECURITY DETAIL HAD  A "PROSTITUTION PROBLEM" THAT  WAS "ENDEMIC."
John: ENDEMIC? HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT, BABY, MY  NEED TO PAY FOR SEX WAS ENDEMIC! IT WAS JUST PART OF THE CULTURE  AT WORK! LIKE HOW YOU AND THE GIRLS AT  THE OFFICE ALL DID THAT CLEANS  TOGETHER. (LAUGHTER)  THINK OF PROSTITUTE AS OUR  GINGER APPLE KALE JUICE. (LAUGHTER)  NOW AT THIS POINT THE STATE  DEPARTMENT SCANDAL IS JUST  ALLEGATIONS SO AS WHISTLES GO IT'S THE KIND OF WHIS THAT WILL  AN ASTHMATIC KITTEN MAKES WHEN  IT TRIES TO BREATHE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  RELAX! THIS FICTITIOUS CAT IS GOING TO  LIVE A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE. (LAUGHTER)  OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M BEING TOLD IT DIED. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  IT WAS HIT BY A MAKE BELIEVE  CAR. YOU HAVE TO BE LEFT EASILY  EMOTIONALLY MA N MANIPULATED  THAN THIS. WHAT I'M SAYING IS IT'S CLEARLY  NOT YET ON THE LEVEL OF, SAY,  EDWARD SNOWDEN'S REVELATIONS. SNOWDEN, OF COURSE, THE N.S.A. CONTRACTOR WHO REVEALED THE  DETAILS OF THEIR CLASSIFIED  PRISM PROGRAM. NOW, THAT IS A WHISTLE THAT HAS  CAUSED TROUBLE. NOT JUST TO THE N.S.A. BUT FOR  THE MEDIA. THEY FACE A VERY DIFFICULT  QUESTION: DO THEY PRIORITIZE THE  LEGAL AND ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF AN UNPRECEDENTED GOVERNMENT  SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM OR DO THEY  GO U.S. WEEKLY ON THE MESSENGER? I'M JUST GOING TO WRITE DOWN  WHICH ONE I THINK AND PUT MY  ANSWER INTO THIS ENVELOPE.
WHO IS EDWARD SNOWEDEN?
THE CIVILIAN CONTRACTOR  WORKING WITH COMPUTERS AT THE  N.S.A..
A 29-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL  DROPOUT. HE WENT TO ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE  SCHOOL IN COF ON THE, MARYLAND.
I THINK HE GOT HIS G.E.D..
HE GAVE TO THE LIBERTARIAN  CANDIDATE RON PAUL.
HE WAS LIVING IN HAWAII WITH  HIS GIRLFRIEND WHO TURNS OUT IS  SOME SORT OF -- LIKE AN ACROBAT OR GYMNAST.
John: OH, LOOK AT THAT! MAYBE I'M GETTING THE HANG OF  THIS JOB. MAYBE I WAS RIGHT. HONESTLY I CAN'T THINK OF  ANYTHING LESS RELEVANT TO BE  TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW THAN WHERE EDWARD SNOWDEN WENT TO  MIDDLE SCHOOL.
THE MAN AT THE CENTER OF THE  U.S. INTELLIGENCE LEAKS IS STILL  IN HIDING BUT HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HER POLE-DANCING YOUTUBE CHANNEL  ARE FRONT AND CENTER.
John: OH FOR (BLEEP)'S SAKE! (LAUGHTER)  I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HEAR MYSELF  SAY THIS BUT I AM NOT INTERESTED  IN ANY POLE DANCING YOUTUBE CHANNELS RIGHT NOW. (LAUGHTER)  STILL I GUESS WE NEED ALL THAT  INFORMATION ON SNOWDEN OTHERWISE  WE WON'T KNOW WHICH INCREDIBLY REDUCTIVE LABEL TO PIN ON HIM.
EDWARD SNOWED SEASON A HERO  TO MANY PEOPLE. HE'S A PUJ. HE'S A LOSER.
THIS MAN IS AN AMERICAN HERO.
HELL KNOW HE'S NOT A HERO.
HE'S DONE A GREAT SERVICE.
INCREDIBLY BRAVE.
HE'S A TRAITOR.
A DEFECTOR OR TRAITOR.
LOOK AT THAT GUY. HE'S A WEASEL. CAN WE PUT HIS FACE ON THE  SCREEN.
WITH WE ALLOWED TO SAY THAT?
HE LOOKS LIKE A WEASEL.
OKAY.
John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D BE SO  QUICK TO JUMP TO THE ARGUMENT  THAT HE MUST BE WHAT HE LOOKS  LIKE. ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN WHAT YOU  LOOK LIKE IS THE GUY IN THE FRAT  HOUSE WHO CAN GET YOU ROOFIES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  IT'S MEAN TO MAKE FUN OF  PEOPLE'S APPEARANCE. STILL, I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THE  IMPULSE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON  EDWARD SNOWDEN. IT'S EASIER TO HAVE AN OPINION  ON A PERSON RATHER THAN ON AN  EXTREMELY COMPLICATED ISSUE. WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR  INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT  SAMANTHA BEE AT INTELLIGENCE  HEADQUARTERS.
HELLO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YES, JOHN?
John: WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE  ON EDWARD SNOWEDEN? HEROIC TRUTH TELLER OR WEASELY  TRAITOR?
WELL, DID SNOWDEN SNITCH ON  YOU?
John: NO.
THEN HE'S A WHISTLE-BLOWER.
John: WHAT IF HE HAD BLOWN  THE WHISTLE ON ME.
OH, WELL, THEN HE'D BE A  SNITCH.
John: SO IT'S REALLY JUST A  QUESTION OF SEMANTICS.
NO, NO, JOHN. WHISTLE-BLOWERS ENJOY A  PRIVILEGED STATUS. THEY GET LEGAL TRIALS,  HIGH-PROFILE MEDIA COVERAGE,  ADORING FANS.
John: AND WHAT DO SNITCHES  GET.
DON'T YOU KNOW? (LAUGHS)  SNITCHES GET STITCHES. (APPLAUSE)
John: I'VE NOT SEEN THAT SIDE  OF YOUR PERSONALITY BEFORE, SAM.
IT'S THERE. THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE EVER  THINKS THEY'RE A SNITCH. EVERYONE WITH A CAMERA PHONE  THINKS THEY'RE A HERO SHEDDING  LIGHT ON INJUSTICE EVEN IF THAT INJUSTICE IS HAVING TO PAY FOR A  COOLATTA.
I WAS HERE LAST NIGHT AND  NITI FORGOT TO GIVE ME A  RECEIPT. THIS IS BEING ROHR RECORDED ON  FACEBOOK. I'M GOING TO GET A MILLION  (BLEEP)ING HITS. YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME MY WATER OR  MY COOLATTA. THIS IS ABOUT TO GO LIVE BITCH,  RIGHT ON FACEBOOK. SO I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR  LITTLE SAND (BLEEP) SELF. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
John: HOLY (BLEEP)
OH, YEAH.
John: SHE JUST WENT FROM  SPOILED CONSUMER TO RACIST  MONSTER IN LESS THAN 20 SECONDS. WOULD THIS WOMAN BE CONSIDERED A  WHISTLE-BLOWER OR A SNITCH?
NO, SHE'S WHAT'S KNOWN IN  INTELLIGENCE CIRCLES AS A  (BLEEP). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
John: IS THAT AN ACRONYM? (LAUGHTER)
UM -- YEAH, SURE IT IS.
John: THANK YOU, SAM. SAMANTHA B
