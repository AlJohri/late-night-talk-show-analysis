[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. IT'S SEPTEMBER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. IT'S SEPTEMBER, THE WHIFF OF FALL IS IN THE AIR. FOOTBALL IS BACK. YOU'RE PROBABLY WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW. AND THIS:
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, SCHOOLS ARE REOPENING TO FIND THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, THERE'S THOUSANDS! HOW ARE THEY GOING TO FIT ALL IN ONE CLASSROOM? I HOPE THEY'RE AT LEAST USING SOME TYPE OF BUNK DESK. THAT WOULD...
THE COSTS ARE MOUNTING, AND NOW SO ARE THE HEALTH CONCERNS. SOME OF THESE MINORS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO CHICKENPOX, TUBERCULOSIS.
STREP THROAT.
MEASLES.
LICE.
SWINE FLU.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SCABIES.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SCABIES WAS THE WORST SALT-N-PEPA SONG EVER. ♪ LET'S TALK ABOUT SCABIES LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU AND ME ♪ LET'S TALK -- [LAUGHTER] SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE TODDLER PANDEMIC. LET'S SAY ONE OF THESE KIDS DID MANAGE TO SMUGGLE A GERM ACROSS THE BORDER, WHAT THEN?
THEY'RE NOT BEING RELEASED INTO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE BEFORE THEY GO THROUGH A VERY THOROUGH SCREENING AND THEY'RE VACCINATED.
LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THE FACTS. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ARE SCARY, AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHY. IN FACT, IMMIGRANTS IN GENERAL. WE SENT OUR OWN MICHAEL CHE TO INVESTIGATE EL GRANDE PELIGRO ON OUR BORDER. HERE'S HIS REPORT.
SINCE LATE LAST YEAR OVER 50,000 IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM WAR-TORN CENTRAL AMERICA ARRIVED ON OUR SOUTHERN BORDER, REIGNITING A NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR IMMIGRATION POLICIES, OR TO PUT IT MORE SIMPLY --
WE'RE UNDER INVASION.
INVASION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED INVASION OF OUR COUNTRY.
JIM GILCHRIST, FOUNDER OF THE MINUTEMAN PROJECT.
IT'S A COVERT, ESSENTIALLY A TROJAN HORSE TYPE OF INVASION INTO THE UNITED STATES.
THESE ARE CHILDREN, RIGHT?
YES, THEY ARE THE VANGUARD OF A MUCH, MUCH LARGER INVASION WHICH WILL LEAD TO THE DEMISE OF OUR NATION AS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC POWER.
CHILDREN?
YES. BUT THEY ARE NOT COMING HERE TO KILL.
THEY'RE COMING HERE TO COLOR.
SURE, IF THEY WANT TO FINGER PAINT, SURE, BUT THEY CAN ALSO DO THAT IN THEIR HOMELAND.
THAT'S RIGHT, THEY'RE AFTER AMERICAN FINGER PAINT, SO HE'S ORGANIZING A NEW BORDER OFFENSIVE STARTING NEXT MAY HE'S CALLING OPERATION NORMANDY.
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS MAN EVERY POROUS AREA ALONG THE BORDER FROM SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA TO, BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS.
IF THIS IS OPERATION NORMANDY AND THE CHILDREN ARE INVADING US, WOULDN'T THAT MAKE US THE NAZIS?
THE REASON I NAMED IT OPERATION NORMANDY WAS TO SHOW HOW LARGE THIS EVENT WILL BE.
I JUST THINK THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD WARS OUT THERE THAT YOU COULD HAVE MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. I MEAN, WHY NOT THE ALAMO? IT'S RIGHT THERE. I MEAN, LITERALLY. IS THAT TOO ON THE NOSE?
BUT AMAZINGLY, AMELIA MARADONOVICH OF THE U.S. COMMITTEE FOR REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY WELCOMES THESE INVADERS.
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS OFFER PROTECTION TO THESE CHILDREN WHO ARE FLEEING. HONDURAS IS THE NUMBER-ONE MURDER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD.
YOU'RE TEACHING THEM TO RUN EVERY TIME SOMEBODY'S TRYING TO MURDER THEM.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. THEY ARE FLEEING WAR AND VIOLENCE AND PERSECUTION.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE WAR ZONES. AND I THINK MOST OF THESE CHILDREN COMING HERE USING THOSE EXECUTIONS ARE LYING. THEY'VE BEEN VERSED ON HOW TO DO IT. TELL THEM YOU'RE A POLITICAL REFUGEE. TELL THEM THAT GANGBANGERS ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU OR SAVE ME AMERICA.
IT'S EITHER THAT OR THEY'RE REALLY JUST REFUGEES.
YES. THEY COULD BE REFUGEES OR THEY COULD BE PART OF THE...
GIANT, ELABORATE PLAN?
RIGHT.
BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE LEGIT REFUGEES, JIM UNDERSTANDS THESE CENTRAL AMERICAN CHILDREN POSE A UNIQUE THREAT TO OUR NATION.
AS THE LATINIZATION OF AMERICA CONTINUES ON, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SPANISH EQUAL TO ENGLISH. THEY WILL HAVE THE INFLUENCE OVER WHO IS GOING TO BECOME YOUR DOGCATCHER, WHO IS GOING TO BECOME YOUR -- AND MAKING US ESSENTIALLY JUST LIKE CHINA. YOU'LL SEE HISTORY BOOKS PROBABLY REWRITTEN...
YEAH.
WHERE THE ALAMO NEVER EXISTED. WELL, THAT'S A BUNCH OF BALDERDASH. HISPANIC GANGS, BLACK GANGS AND NOW WHITE GANGS, TOO.
NO?
YES.
NOT WHITE GANGS? SO WHO WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH TO WELCOME IN PEOPLE LIKE THAT?
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING VERMONT TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF HOUSING SOME OF THOSE KIDS.
BUT IT MAY BE TOO LATE. IT TURNS OUT VERMONT HAS BEEN TAKING IN THESE ALAMO-DENYING, DOG-CATCHER ELECTING REFUGEES FOR 25 YEARS. AND WHEN I VISITED THIS GOAT FARM RUN BY REFUGEES WHO CAME HERE DECADES AGO, I WAS MET BY A TERRIFYING GANG THAT DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH. DEAR GOD, THE PEOPLE OF VERMONT NEEDED OPERATION NORMANDY MORE THAN EVER.
OPERATION NORMANDY? SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE INVADING. THEY'RE NOT INVADING. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE.
WELL THIS IS ABOUT REFUGEES SNEAKING INTO THE COUNTRY AND LYING THAT THEY'RE COMING FROM WAR-TORN COUNTRIES WHEN OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT?
YOU CAN JUST TELL. I CAN JUST TELL. THEY JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.
I'M A REFUGEE HERE.
YOU'RE A REFUGEE?
YES.
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO BUY ANY DRUGS.
OKAY.
JUST SAYING. WHILE THIS PERSON CAN'T COME IN BECAUSE OF THEIR COLOR OR THEIR RACE.
NO, NOT BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OR THE RACE BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY'RE FROM AND THEIR COLOR AND THEIR RACE.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO STOP SOMEBODY FROM HAVING A BETTER LIFE?
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO HAVE IT HERE.
IF YOU CAN GET GOD TO SIGN THAT, THEN EVERYBODY ELSE WILL.
IF I COULD GET GOD TO SIGN IT, I WOULDN'T BE HERE. I'D BE ON "AMERICA'S GOT TALENT." I NOW UNDERSTOOD HOW HARD IT MUST BE FOR JIM TO GET PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT CONFRONTING HELPLESS CHILDREN.
WE'RE NOT THE SAME COUNTRY TODAY THAT WE WERE 40 YEARS AGO.
I AGREE WITH YOU. WE USED TO HATE IMMIGRANTS. NOW SOME AMERICANS ARE ACTUALLY HELPING THEM.
IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE HAVE BEEN CHILDREN IN ONE COUNTRY WHO COULD NOT GET TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE SOME DAY. WE CAN'T STOP THAT. I'M NOT GIVING A DEATH WISH ON THESE CHILDREN COMING HERE
OK.
OR THE ILLEGAL ALIENS. I'M SAYING THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS REALISTICALLY YOU CANNOT STOP.
I'M JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO NOT SAY ANYTHING AND WATCH YOU BE UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT MIGHT SOUND TOUGH, BUT I CALL IT TOUGH LOVE.
SO I GUESS WE'RE JUST WAITING ON THE LOVE PART TO KICK IN.
MICHAEL CHE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
