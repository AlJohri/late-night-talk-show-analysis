[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HAD TO COME BACK FROM THE COMMERCIAL.
IT HAPPENS.
Jon: WELCOME BACK THE SQUARE AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX AND SELECT CITIES. YOU WERE SAYING AHMED WHO IS ONE OF CHARACTERS, YOU SAID YOU CANNOT SHOW IT YET IN EGYPT, THIS FILM THIS IS INSPIRING PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. WHY IS THAT?
WE'RE WAITING FOR PERMISSION. IT'S CURRENTLY IN CENSORSHIP. HE SAID SOMETHING INCREDIBLE, HE SAID I'M GETTING THE TWEETS. I'M HEARING -- I'M READING ALL OF THE ARTICLES, THE ACCOLADES COMING OUT ABOUT THE FILM, THE FACT THAT WE WERE SHORT LISTED, ALL OF THIS STUFF IS GOING TO MAKE THE FILM ABSOLUTELY UNSTOPPABLE. IT'S THE SAME KIND OF THING YOU WERE DOING BY PUTTING BASSEM ON THIS INTERNATIONAL STAGE SAYING COMEDY IS IMPORTANT. THE FILM IS DOING THE SAME THING. THE SUPPORT FROM YOU GUYS NOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- IN TERMS OF THE -- HAS IT BEEN SURPRISING? SO YOU SEE THE HOPES OF THE PEOPLE UNDER AN AUTOCRATIC RULE FOR 30 YEARS. THEY BREAK THROUGH THIS WITH THIS INCREDIBLE DEMONSTRATION IN THE STREETS. DEMOCRACY LEADS THEM TO A BROTHERHOOD LED GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY FEEL BECOMES AUTOCRATIC IN ITS OWN RIGHT, STARTS TO PUT ISLAMISTS INTO POSITIONS. THEY TAKE TO THE STREETS AGAIN. BY THE MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE THAN IN THE HISTORY OF HISTORIES.
MORE THAN AGAINST MUBARAK.
Jon: AND DRIVE HIM OUT.
RIGHT.
Jon: THERE'S THIS EUPHORIA AGAIN AND THEN THE MILITARY COMES IN AND IT FEELS NOW FROM AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER CLOSER TO THE MUBARAK ERA THAN IT HAD AT ANY TIME SINCE THE REVOLUTIONT STARTED. THAT THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THERE AS WELL?
IT'S A REALLY DARK TIME NOW. PEOPLE ARE BEING ARRESTED. WE'VE HAD A WHOLE REVOLUTION. OUR FILM HAS NOT PASSED CENSORSHIP. PEOPLE ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR HOMES AND ARRESTED, YOU KNOW, IN WAYS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE. THE HOPE IS AND THE THE POSITIVITY I FEEL OR THE HOPE THAT I FEEL IS WATCHING THE STAYING POWER OF THE PEOPLE CONTINUING TO FIGHT, THAT ARE CONTINUING TO BE IN THE STREETS. JUST THE OTHER DAY THIS PROTEST LAW WAS PASSED. 80 PEOPLE WENT DOWN TO THE STREETS, MANY OF WHOM WERE ARRESTED. THEY DECIDED TO RELOOK AT THE PROTEST LAW. IT DOESN'T TAKE 80 MILLION PEOPLE TO CHANGE A COUNTRY. IT TAKES A DEDICATED FEW TO CONTINUE PUSHING, TO CONTINUE PUSHING AND THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING.
Jon: WHEN DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A CHANGE -- THAT PERSON IS VERY INSPIRED. [ LAUGHTER ] WHEN DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A CHANGE OF MENTALITY IN TERMS OF THE RULING PARTIES THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT ALLOWING DISSENT IS STRENGTH NOT WEAKNESS? THAT'S THE DISCONNECT FOR ME? WHEN I SEE THEM ARREST BASIM OR TAKE THE BLOGGERS AND ACTIVISTS AND THEY ARREST THEM FOR JUST EXPRESSING THEIR OPINION AS A SHOW OF STRENGTH.
IT'S A WEAK MOVE.
Jon: RIGHT. WHEN IS THAT GOING TO BE UNDERSTOOD?
THEY DON'T GET IT. IT'S AN OLD WAY OF DOING THINGS. BUT I THINK IT'S JUST THINGS -- PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING AND KEEP PUSHING AND KEEP PUSHING. THAT'S WHAT STARTS TO CHANGE THINGS. LOOK AT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, RIGHT? WE -- IT WAS MESSY AND IT WAS LONG. ALL CHANGE, ALL MOVEMENTS ARE MESSY AND BREAK THINGS APART, RIGHT. WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THE CHANGE WE FOUGHT FOR BACK THEN. SO THE KEY IS NOT GIVING UP. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THESE -- I DON'T THINK WE'LL KNOW THE RESULTS OF THIS REVOLUTION FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT A CONSCIOUSNESS HAS CHANGED. PEOPLE IN THE STREET WILL NO LONGER SAY OH, IT'S OKAY TO JUST ARREST THAT PERSON AND TORTURE THEM. THERE'S A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HAS CHANGED. IF YOU ASK ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN IN THE STREETS HAS THIS ALL BEEN FOR NOTHING? PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO. PEOPLE HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. A CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG HAS CHANGED. THAT'S HUGE.
Jon: IS THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CULTURE OR MORE OF A GENERATIONAL ISSUE. AND AS THAT GENERATION COMES TO PROMINENCE THAT IS WHEN IT WILL MOVE TO THE FORE?
MY PERSONAL OPINION IS IT'S A GENERATIONAL ISSUE. WE NEED A WHOLE NEW GENERATION TO COME IN -- FOR THINGS TO REALLY CHANGE. IT'S A LONG FIGHT. THERE'S A LONG FIGHT AHEAD OF US.
Jon: I WISH EVERYBODY THE BEST. I WAS THERE A WEEK OR SO BEFORE THE LATEST JUNE UPRISING. THE ENERGY ON THE STREETS AND BOY IS IT AN INSPIRATIONALAND PLACE.
I WAS THERE WHEN YOU WERE THERE. AFTER I WAS ARRESTED.
Jon: YOU WERE THAT LADY THAT HAD JUST BEEN ARRESTED.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
Jon: THERE I WAS SITTING THERE EATING THE HUMMUS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND CONGRATULATIONS. BOY, WHAT A WONDERFUL PIECE OF ART THIS IS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jon: THE SQUARE IS AVAILABLE ON NETFLIX. SELECT CITIES JANUARY 17. JEHANE NOUJAIM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
