WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A COUNTRY MUSIC LEGEND AND ACTRESS, HER NEW MOVIE IS CALLED JOYFUL NOISE.
WELL, I AM WHO I AM.
MAYBE YOU WERE FIVE PROCEDURES AGO. NOW YOU ARE WHOEVER YOU NEED TO BE TO MAKE EVERYBODY LOVE YOU. LARGER-THAN-LIFE.
WELL, IT PISSES ME OFF. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT PISSES ME OFF?
NOT PARTICULARLY.
ARE YOU GONEA HEAR IT. IT IS YOUR WHOLLIER THAN THOU, BYOUS, RACIST, SENT OF RIGHTUSNESS. IF I HAD A FEW LITTLE NIPS AND TUCK, GOD DIDN'T MAKE PLASTIC SURGEONS SO THEY COULD STARVE. BUT YOU COULD USE A COMPLETE FACELIFT.
I FEEL FINE ABOUT MYSELF.
WELL, I DON'T SEE HOW YOU COULD, YOU OLD-- HEFER.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, DOLLY PARTON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU.
GOOD. WE FACE THAT WAY OR THIS WAY.
Jon: YOU CAN TALK TO ME. LET ME SAY THIS I DON'T SAY THIS TO EVERYBODY. I'VE MISSED YOU.
WELL THANK YOU.
Jon: I HAVEN'T SEEN IN AWE A LITTLE WHILE. YOUR PERSONALITY IS JUST, VERY, I GUESS THE WORD WOULD BE VIVACIOUS S THAT WHAT THEY WOULD SAY.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THANK YOU. EVERYBODY SAID THEY LOVED US TOGETHER. AND I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THAT. SO I'M HAPPY THAT YOU ARE BRINGING ME BACK SO I CAN TALK ABOUT MY STUFF.
Jon: I MAKE THE CALLS OR SEND THE LETTERS IT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL OR SAY HARASSMENT. TELL ME ABOUT THIS JOYFUL NOISE, IS THIS A MOVIE ABOUT GOSPEL.
WELL, IT'S GOT ALL THIS GREAT GOSPEL MUSIC IN IT AND  IT'S THE STORY ABOUT A SMALL TOWN IN GEORGIA THAT HAS FALLEN ON HARD TIMES. AND THE ECONOMY IS BAD.
Jon: SO PURE FICTION.
EXACTLY. SO IT'S ABOUT THIS CHURCH THAT IS ALWAYS COMPETED IN COMPETITIONS THAT THEY CAN'T  AFFORD TO DO IT. SO ANYWAY CHRISTOPHERSON WHO PLAYS MY HUSBAND, HE DIES EARLY ON, HE IS THE CHOIR  DIRECTOR SO I THINK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE CHOIR, AND OF COURSE LA  FIV-- LATIFAH IS A GREAT SINGER AND THE COMMITTEE SAYS SHE SHOULD DO IT. SO OF COURSE THE RUB STARTS THERE. SO WE KIND OF FIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH BUT IT'S ABOUT, AND IT IS A LOT OF FUN IN IT, A LOT OF LAUGHS T IS A COMEDY AS WELL, HEART AND SOUL.
Jon: HOW MUCH, HOW MANY ROLLS DID YOU THROW AT QUEEN LATIFAH.
ACTUALLY T TOOK A DAY AND A HALF TO DO THAT SCENE BECAUSE IT WAS A LONG SCENE, OF COURSE, A LOT OF FOOD, THROWING FOOD. BUT I PUT 24 ROLLS. BUT HI A PRETTY GOOD AIM.
Jon: I DOT TO TELL YOU, YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS ARM. I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCELLENT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS, SHE BLOCKED A COUPLE OF THEM WITH THE TRAY. HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU POP HER.
I POPPED HER A FEW TIMES T WAS KIND OF FUNNY, IT WOULD MISS, I'M USED TO  PLAYING GUITAR I HAVE PRETTY GOOD HAND TO EYE COORDINATION. I USED TO PLAY WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO PLAY SOFTBALL AND I CAN HIT A GOLF BALL  PRETTY GOOD SO ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE HANDS. SO I WAS BANG HER PRETTY GOOD BUT SHE DESERVE IT. SHE DESERVED EVERY ROLL I PUT ON HER.
Jon: I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD THINK SHE DIDN'T DESERVE YOUR THROWING. BUT SHE DOESN'T REALIZE-- NOW, YOU ARE IN STATURE OBVIOUSLY A LEGEND IN THE BUSINESS BUT  PHYSICALLY, A SMALLER INDIVIDUAL. LATIFAH IS, IF I MAY, ALSO A LEGEND IN THE INDUSTRY BUT A LARGER. WAS THERE EVER-- WAS THERE PHYSICAL FIGHTING.
YES. SHE GETS ME IN A CHOKE HOLD AND I'M THIS TINY LITTLE THING DOWN HERE. I CALL IT BIGGIE SMALL FROM THAT WORD.
Jon: NICE REFERENCE.
BUT ANYWAY WE DO AT THE END WHEN THEY SUM UP THIS WHOLE THING, SHE REALLY HAS  ME IN A CHOKE HOLD. SHE'S GOT ME, SHE COULD HAVE HURT ME BAD IF SHE HAD WANTED TO. BUT SHE DIDN'T. SHE'S GREAT. SHE IS BIG, 5, 9, 5, 10. AND I'M-- 5, 1, 5, 2.
Jon: TO ME THAT IS BIG. I LOOK AT THAT AND THINK OH GOD F ONLY.
BUT SHE'S GREAT, I LOVE HER, HER HEART IS FUN.
Jon: YOU HAD FUN.
WE HAD A GREAT TIME AND THE MUSIC IS SPECTACULAR T IS A WARNER BROTHERS FILM.
Jon: YOU WROTE IT.
I WROTE THREE OF THE MAIN SONGS IN IT. AND I HAD A CHANCE TO, YOU KNOW, SINGE ALL THE GREAT STUFF THAT I HADN'T HAD A CHANCE TO.
Jon: GOSPEL.
WELL, I WAS BROUGHT NEWSPAPER THE CHURCH, PENT COSTAL HOLLER ROLLER. WE DIDN'T HAVE-- A CHOIR BUT WE, EVERYBODY WAS SING AND SHOUTING AND PRAYING TO THE  LORD AND ALL THAT.
Jon: WE JEWS ARE LIKE THAT EXCEPT WITH COMPLAINING. WE ALL GET TOGETHER AND OH MY BACK, OH --
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING IS VERY CHRISTIAN, IT'S ALL ABOUT  JESUS AND ALL THESE WONDERFUL GOSPEL CHOIRS. BUT IT WAS WRITTEN BY A JEW, TODD GRASS WHO-- .
Jon: IT'S WHAT WE DO.
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT HE DID A GREAT JOB. DE A WONDERFUL. HE REALLY GOT-- .
Jon: WERE YOU ABLE TO HARKEN BACK TO YOUR DAYS IN GOSPEL, WAS THAT JUST, YOU  KNOW, WHERE YOU GOT THE LOVING THE MUSIC WHERE IT ALL CAMING TO FOR YOU.
YES, MY GRANDPA WAS A PREACHER AND A GREAT SINGER, GREAT MUSICIAN. MY MOTHER'S PEOPLE WERE ALL VERY MUSICAL MOSTLY IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT I WANTED TO MAKE A BUSINESS OUT OF IT. BUT I STILL TO THIS DAY BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE I LEARNED TO SING IN CHURCH, WE ALWAYS WENT TO CHURCH. AND I STILL HAVE A FEELING SINGING GOSPEL MUSIC THAT I DON'T GET IN ANYTHING ELSE.
Jon: I LOVE, AND THIS MAY BE AN ABSOLUTE SORT OF STEREOTYPICAL PICTURE THAT I  HAD MY HEAD, OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND THESE FAMILIES GATHERED TOGETHER AND EVERYBODY HAS GOT THE  MUSIC AND THEY'RE ALL SITTING AROUND ON A SATURDAY NIGHT AND JUST GOING AROUND  SAYING, I USED TO LOOK AT THAT AND MAYBE ROMANT SIZE IT, THAT FEELING OF I DON'T  KNOW, JUST THAT TALENT BUT ALSO WITH FAMILY AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER. IS THAT MADE NEWSPAPER MY HEAD OR THAT IS A REAL --
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE USED TO DO. ESPECIALLY MY FAMILY AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. WE ALL USED TO SING AND WE USE ODD GO AROUND AND SING AT ALL THE FUNERALS, WEDDINGS, SQUARE DANCES, ANYWHERE THERE WAS MUSIC IN THE COMMUNITY. AND CERTAINLY AROUND OUR HOUSE AND ON SUNDAYS. WE WOULD GET NEWSPAPER CHURCH TOO AND DO ALL THAT SPECIAL SING, PLAY OUR GUITARS AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS. IT WAS GREAT SO EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR MIND IS HOW I DID GROW UP WITH A FAMILY  OF 12 CHILDREN. THIS COUNTRY PEOPLE AND THE CHURCH AND THE MUSIC WAS WHAT KEPT US GOING.
Jon: YEAH, AFTER SCHOOL WHAT I WOULD DO IS COME HOME THERE WAS A KEY PUT UNDER A  CARPET AND I-- I WOULD GO IN AND HEAT MYSELF UP SOME SPAGHETTI-O. >>.
WELL, WE WOULD HAVE PRAYED FOR YOU. WE WILL KEEP IN OUR PRAYERS.
Jon: YOU ARE A LOVELY WOMAN IT IS SO GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ARE YOU GOING TO DIE BIG MUSICAL AND COME BACK AND SEE US.
ANY TIME I GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU I WILL COME BACKMENT GO SEE THE MUSIC, IT IS GREAT. CALLED JOYFUL NOISE AND IT'S FUN.
Jon: OPENS FRIDAY, DOLLY PARTON, EVERYBODY.
