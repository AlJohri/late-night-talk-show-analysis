WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CREATOR  AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF HBO'S  PROGRAM.
WE HOPE WHEN YOU COME TO OUR  COUNTRY, YOU WILL GO FISHING  BECAUSE NO ONE WILL FEED ME. BECAUSE YOU LOVE FISHING.
I DON'T. BUT THIS IS STILL A BEAUTIFUL  GIFT. I ALSO HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU OF  FAMOUS FURS.
OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, MY. THANK YOU. WHAT A LOVELY CLOCK WITH AN  UNUSUAL BIRD.
ANGRY BIRDS. D WHY IS IT SO ANGRY? PLEASE WELCOME TO THE GREAT  ARMANDO IMNNUCHI.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ALL THE  PRESSURE ON ME THIS NEXT SEGMENT  AND TOTALLY OFF YOU.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE REASONS  THAT I'M DOING THIS AS A CAREER  ANYWAY. ARMANDO IS IS ONE OF THE MOST  SIGNIFICANT FIGURES. THIS SHOULD MAKE YOU AS  UNCOMFORTABLE TO HEAR AS IT IS  TO SAY. AS BRITISH PEOPLE, NEITHER OF US  CAN HANDLE THIS KIND OF  COMPLIMENTS.
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
ARMANDO IS ONE OF THE  GREATEST COMIC WRITERS IN  ENGLAND. HE WAS... DON'T LAUGH. I'M BEING GENUINE. THIS IS NOT HOW THE 13-YEAR-OLD  THINKS THIS CONVERSATION WOULD  GO.
I LOVE MY SARCASM. ONCE DID A TALK ON COMEDY  TO MI5, THE INTELLIGENCE  GATHERING...
HOLD ON. HOW THE [BLEEP] DID THAT COME  ABOUT?
BECAUSE MI5 BECAUSE OF WHAT  THEY DO, THEY SOCIALIZE TOGETHER  IN GROUPS. SO THEY GO ON MUSEUM TRIPS  TOGETHER. THEY GO ON STAGE TOGETHER.
WHAT? BUT JAMES BOND AND 00 AND 005  GO AND SEE TOMMY OR...
WHY NOT? MUSICAL FANS.
BIG MUSICAL FANS. HIS A FINAL DAY SO YOU WANT TO  RELAX WITH A CATCHY TUNE. ONCE A MONTH THEY HAVE SPEAKER  EVENINGS WHERE THEY INVITE  PEOPLE IN TO THE MI5 BUILDING AND ASK THEM TO TALK ABOUT THEIR  PARTICULAR INTERESTS. I GROT A CALL SAYING, COULD YOU  TALK ABOUT COMEDY. FASCINATED BY WHAT YOU DO ON THE  TELLY. CAN YOU TALK TO THEM.
THIS IS ALL TRUE BY THE WAY. I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THIS. I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE  SAYING. THAT'S LIKE THE C.I.A. GETTING  DENIS LEARY AND SAYING EXPLAIN  THE CONCEPT OF LAUGHTER TO US.
THEY DID CALL THEMSELVES MI5  TO START WITH. THEY DIDN'T CALL THEMSELVES  ANOTHER NAME. ABOUT A YEAR BACKGROUND CHECKING  IT WAS FINE. AND WE KNEW THEY WERE MI5. AND I STOOD UP IN AN  INTELLIGENCE CHAMBER. I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT  COMEDY. I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO  KILL YOU. AT THE END OF IT THEY READ  NOTICES LIKE LAST YEAR THEY  RAISED 100 POUNDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING. WE ARE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO KILL  YOU.
IT'S LESS FUNNY COMING FROM  THEM.
AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A CHEESE  AND WINE DRINK UPSTAIRS AT MI5.
YOU MAKE THIS LOOK LIKE THE  PARODIES WE ARE.
THIS FINGER HAS A BULLET IN  IT THAT CAN... SOMEONE CAME  UPSTAIRS AND SAID SHE ACTUALLY WENT, WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN  YOU FOUND OUT WHO WE REALLY ARE? CON CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE COMING BACK FOR SERIES  3.
YES, WE START WRITING IT  TODAY.
HOW ARE PEOPLE RESPONDING TO  THE CHARACTER OF AN OAFISH VICE  PRESIDENT WHO CAN'T GET ANYTHING  RIGHT? IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN  BELIEVE.
THE CURRENT PICTURE IS ALL  ABOUT SPIES AND WHO KNEW WHAT  AND WHO KNEW WHAT AND HOW FAR DID IT GO AND DID THE PRESIDENT  KNOW? IT'S ALL BASED ON FICTION.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S JUST A BIT OF HARMLESS FUN.
STRANGE. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF... I MEAN IT  IS VERY EFFECTIVE. THERE ARE CERTAIN CHARACTERRERS  IN IT. SHE WENT TO LUNCH WITH JOE BIDEN  AND HE SAID I'M THE DAN. WE HAVE VERY AFFECTED BY  HOLLYWOOD. I WAS SHOWN AROUND THE WEST WING  BY OBAMA'S AIDES. HE SHOWED US INTO THE ROOSEVELT  ROOM. HE SAID THIS WOULD BE WHAT C.J. AND JOSH WOULD MEET...
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT GOOD. YOU'RE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME. JOSH IS AN ACTOR.
IT'S NOT AS IMPRESSIVE. IT'S FANTASTIC. HAVE YOU GOT TIME TO STICK  AROUND? CAN WE GO TO THE WEB? WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE WEB.
THOSE WATCHING THE WEB. THE GOVERNMENT AND ALMOST NO ONE  ELSE.
SUNDAY NIGHTS AT 10:00 ON  HBO. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
