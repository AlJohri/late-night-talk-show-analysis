FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
John: WELCOME TO THE "DAILY  SHOW."  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW."  I'M JOHN OLIVER. JON STEWART IS OFF FOR THE  SUMMER PERFORMING A DAVID  BLAINE-LIKE STUNT WHERE HE SPENDS 90 STRAIGHT DAYS NOT  HOSTING A TALK SHOW. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS FAREED  ZAKARIA. THIS IS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YES. THIS IS ACTUALLY HIS 17th  TIME ON THE SHOW, SO HE  LITERALLY HAS MORE EXPERIENCE WITH INTERVIEW SEGMENTS ON THIS  SHOW THAN I DO. ( LAUGHTER )  BUT FIRST, IT SEEMS LIKE A  SUPREME COURT DECISION ON GAY  MARRIAGE WILL COME DOWN SOME TIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOME  SEISMIC CHANGES RECENTLY IN OUR  NATION'S SOLE LANDSCAPE.
AFTER MONTHS OF CONSIDERATION  ABOUT INITIATIVES AS DIVIDED ITS  RANKS, DURING A PASSIONATE DEBATE, TONIGHT THE BOY SCOUTS  OF AMERICA HAS VOTED TO ALLOW  OPENLY GAY MEMBERS.
John: YES! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YES! YES! YES! NOW, THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS FOR  GAY BOY SCOUTS, BUT--  ( LAUGHTER )  A TRAGIC END FOR THE MERIT BADGE FOR CLOSET STAINING. EASY TO EARN THAT BADGE. DIFFICULT TO KEEP. BUT THIS PROGRESS IS ACTUALLY  NOT QUITE WHAT IT SEEMS.
THIS MEANS THE LONG-STANDING  POLICY WILL BE LIFTED THAT HAD  BANNED GAY SCOUTS, BUT IT REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR BANNING  GAY SCOUT LEADERS.
John: OH, SO, THEY'RE HAPPY  TO WELCOME ANYONE WITH  HOMOSEXUAL THOUGHTS, UP UNTIL THE AGE WHEN THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH  TO ACT ON THEM. ( LAUGHTER )  THAT MUST CREATE AN AWKWARD  SITUATION AT BOY SCOUT  GRADUATIONS. ( LAUGHTER )  CONGRATULATIONS, SCOUT. GAY SCOUTS LIKE YOU MAKE US ALL  PROUD. OH, I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. I'D LIKE TO COME BACK AS A  LEADER ONE DAY. YOU BURN IN HELL, PERVERT! YOU BURN IN HELL! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  I GUESS THIS IS PROGRESS OF A  SORT HOWEVER FRACTIONAL OR LONG  OVERDUE. AND YET IT'S STILL ENOUGH TO  UPSET SOME PEOPLE.
TO RIP APART AN ORGANIZATION  THAT HAS DONE SO MUCH GOOD FOR  YOUNG PEOPLE, THE BOY SCOUTS, TO SEE THAT TORN UP IN ORDER TO  ACCOMMODATE A FEW KIDS THAT, YOU  KNOW, WANT TO DO SEX WITH EACH  OTHER. ( LAUGHTER )
John: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,  WAIT, WAIT. DO SEX? THAT PHRASE IS JUST THE LATEST  REASON THEY FEEL INCREDIBLY  SORRY FOR MRS.  PAT ROBERTSON. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )    ( CHEERS )   WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO SEX  TONIGHT, DARLING? WELL, NO, SWEETHEART, BUT IT  WOULD BE NICE IF YOU WOULD TEAR  OFF MY EARS AND FINTERTIPS. SO WE HAVE CLEARLY STILL GOT A  WAYS TO GO AT HOME. WHAT ABOUT OVERSEAS? WHERE PEOPLE ARE FAMOUSLY MORE  ENLIGHTENED ABOUT THESE ISSUES. LET'S CHECK IN WITH TONIGHT'S  INSTALLMENT OF "GAYWATCH:  INTERNATIONAL EDITION." ( LAUGHTER )  BROUGHT TO YOU BY INTERNATIONAL  MALE. INTERNATIONAL MALE, SELL MESH  UNDERPANTS FOR PRETEND PIRATES  SINCE 1974. OUR FIRST STOP, OUR FIRST STOP  ON THIS TRIP, FRANCE, WHICH  RECENTLY LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE, A MOVE THAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME  WAS MET WITH THE TRADITIONAL  NATIONWIDE TBALLIC SHRUG.
VIOLENCE ERUPTED ACROSS PARIS  AS DEMONSTRATORS SWARMED TO THE  STREET OVER FRANCE'S LAW ALLOWING GAY MARRIAGE. THERE WERE 150,000  DEMONSTRATORS.
John: REALLY.
BOOOO!
John: I DID NOT EXPECT  THAT. I GUESS THEY JUST FEEL VERY  STRONGLY ABOUT PRESERVING  TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IN FRANCE, WHICH SOF COURSE, ONE MAN, ONE  WOMAN, AND HER SISTER, AND THEIR  MAID, AND THE COLLEGE-AGE DAUGHTER FRIEND WHO STAYED WITH  THEM DURING THE SUMMER-- YOU  KNOW, TRADITIONAL FRENCH MARRIAGE, LIKE GOD INTENDED. ACTUALLY, CAN WE SEE SOME OF THE  THAT PROTEST FOOTAGE AGAIN? QUICK QUESTION--  ( LAUGHTER )  HOW IS IT THAT FRANCE'S ANTIGAY  PROTESTS LOOK SO MUCH GAYER THAN OUR PRO-GAY PROTESTS? THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  YOU CAN'T BE A GAY-- WHAT-- AND  THAT WASN'T EVEN FRANCE'S GAYEST ANTIGAY PROTEST.
FIREWORKS AT THE FRENCH OPEN  THIS WEEKEND. HAD NOTHING TO DO, THOUGH, WITH  TENNIS. A MASKED, BARE CHESTED PROTESTER  LEAPED ON TO THE COURT AND LIT A  FLARE OVER FRANCE'S DECISION TO LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE.
John: LISTEN, I DON'T WANT  TO BE IN THE POSITION OF GIVING  TIPS TO BIGOTED ANTIGAY FORCES, BUT JUST IN TERMS OF PURE  MESSAGE DISCIPLINE YOU MIGHT  WANT TO GO WITH SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SO MUCH SCREAM AUDITION  PIECE FOR CIRQUE DU SOLEIL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). NOW, LIKE, PEOPLE CAN PROTEST  ALL THEY WANT, BUT WITH VOTES  HAPPENING ACROSS EUROPE, MARRIAGE EQUALITY SEEMS TO BE  TAKING ROOT. WHAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD  TODAY HAVE THE BALLS TO SAY THAT  GAYS ARE NOT EQUAL CITIZENS WITH EQUAL RIGHTS?
THE LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT  IN RUSSIA VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY  TODAY FOR A BILL THAT TARGETS  GAYS.
John: OKAY, RUSSIA, YEAH,  RUSSIA. ( LAUGHTER )  ACTUALLY QUITE A FEW, BUT RUSSIA  WOULD DEFINITELY BE AMONG THEM. SO SPECIFICALLY, WHAT'S IN THIS  BILL? THE RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT HAS VOTED  ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY TO PASS A LAW  TO PUNISH THE PROMOTION OF HOMOSEXUALITY WITH FINES AND  JAIL TERMS GLAIN THAT IS TUG  ACTUALLY SMART BECAUSE NOTHING REDUCES INCIDENTSES OF  HOMOSEXUALITY LIKE A LENGTHY  JAIL TERM. ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S SOME VISIONARY THINKING. SO FAR, THIS BILL WAS ACTUALLY  ONLY PASSED BY THE LOWER HOUSE  OF PARLIAMENT, SO WHAT HAPPENS  NOW?
THE BILL NOW GOES TO THE  SENATE BEFORE BEING SIGNED INTO  LAW BY PRESIDENT PUTIN. THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE A  FORMALITY.
John: I WOULDN'T ACTUALLY  BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT. REMEMBER, THIS IS THE MAN THAT  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.  ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  SERIOUSLY, AT THIS POINT, I  FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS THREE MONTHS SHY OF  HAVING HIS OWN CALENDAR. COME ON, COME ON. WE CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER  TITLE THAN THAT. BETTER. YES. THERE IT IS. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THAT IS THE PERFECT ONE. SO GAYS ARE COMING UNDER ATTACK  IN BOTH FRANCE AND RUSSIA, BUT  THERE IS ONE PLACE WHERE, APPARENTLY, THEY HAVE FOUND A  HOME.
A STUNNING REVELATION COMING  FROM THE HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC  CHURCH. POPE FRANCIS SAYS THERE IS A GAY  LOBBY AT THE VATICAN.
John: I DON'T KNOW IF I  CALL A VATICAN GAY LOBBY A  STUNNING REVELATION, REALLY. THE WHOLE BUILDING IS BASICALLY  A LIBERACE FEVER DREAM, UNLESS  YOU DON'T MEAN AN ARCHITECTUAL  LOBBY.
"GAY LOBBY" I THINK IS KIND  OF A CONFUSING TERM. WE USE LOBBY TO MEAN SOMEBODY  PUTTING FORTH A CERTAIN AGENDA.
I'M SORRY, I WASN'T LISTENING  TO A WORD THAT MAN WAS SAYING  BECAUSE I WAS LOST IN HIS EYES. LOOK AT THEM, SO PIERCING BLUE. IT'S AS IF ANDERSON COOPER AND A  SIBERIAN HUSKY MADE LOVE AND HAD  A BABY. I WANT ONE OF THOSE. I WANT ONE OF THOSE. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, FATHER McDREAMY,  YOU WERE SAYING THAT LOBBY IS  NOT A GOOD WORD FOR IT.
PROBABLY A BETTER WORD WOULD  BE "GAY CABAL," "GAY CLIQUE."
John: RIGHT AND OTHER NOUNS  INCLUDE A GAY BRUNCH AIR, MAN  PILE. A CABIN CREW. AND OSCAR PARTY OR A PALM  SPRINGS TRAFFIC JAM. ( LAUGHTER )  IF THERE IS A GAY LOBBY, WHAT IS  IT THAT THEY WANT? HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD THEY DO?
SO THERE HAVE BEEN LONG RUMOR  HERE'S THAT THE GAY LOBBY DROVE  POPE BENEDICT FROM THE CHURCH.
John: THAT IS JUST  RIDICULOUS. A GAY LOBBY DID NOT DRIVE POPE  BENEDICT FROM THE CHURCH BECAUSE  IF THEY HAD, IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE THIS.  ♪ ♪ ♪  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT,  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE HELL OF  AN EXIT. THE BOTTOM LINE TO ALL OF THIS  IS NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY YOU  LIVE IN, WHAT RELIGION YOU BELONG TO, IT SEEMS CRAZY THAT  IN THIS DAY AND AGE, ANYONE HAS  A PROBLEM WITH WHICH GENDER YOU WANT TO, UHM-- WHAT'S THE  PHRASE?
WHAT TO DO SEX WITH EACH  OTHER. ( CHEERS AND APPLA
