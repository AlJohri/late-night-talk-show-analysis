SEPTEMBER 20, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! OH, MY NAME IS JON STEWART! THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. OUR GUEST TONIGHT RON SUSKIND. HE IS THE... (APPLAUSE) WHOO! AUTHOR FAN! HE'S THE AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK ON HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT ON AN ALL-CITRUS DIET. (LAUGHTER) I'M SORRY, THE AUTHOR OF A BOOK ABOUT THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE AND  THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND HOW THAT GUY (BLEEP)ED EVERYTHING UP. ALL RIGHT. (LAUGHTER) WELL, THEY WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE STAFF OF THE SHOW ON WINNING THE EMMY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THEY WORKED SO HARD AND WERE HONORED AND WE'RE DELIGHTED... (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND I THINK IT'S... IF YOU JUST WIN ONE MORE, JUST ONE. (LAUGHTER) WE MIGHT BEGIN TO BELIEVE. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, LET'S BEGIN THE NIGHT WITH NEWS FROM THE MILITARY. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS SHOW FROM A MILITARY BASE AND YOU'VE NOTICED THAT YOUR FELLOW  SOLDIERS SEEM SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2% TO 10% HAPPIER TODAY-- (LAUGHTER)  -- THE FIGURES ARE VERY HARD TO GET. THERE'S A REASON.
THE POLICY THAT BANNED GAYS FROM SERVING OPENLY IN THE MILITARY IS NOW HISTORY.
FROM NOW ON, GAYS CAN SERVE OPENLY IN THE MILITARY.
AND THE 13,000 WHO WERE DISCHARGED UNDER "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" CAN REENLIST.
Jon: THAT'S HOW RIDICULOUS THIS POLICY WAS. THE APOLOGY FOR THE AFFRONT IS "ALL RIGHT, SORRY, YOU CAN GO TO AFGHANISTAN AND FIGHT FOR YOUR  COUNTRY." (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY... I KNOW. THEY'RE LUCKY IT WAS GAY PEOPLE THAT THEY DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY. ONLY GAY PEOPLE WOULD REMAIN IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE TO BE ABLE TO REENLIST. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) FOR MORE ON THE END OF "DON'T  ASK, DON'T TELL," WE GO TO JASON JONES INSIDE CAMP D.W.I.ER IN  HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN. JASON, WHAT'S THE SITUATION OVER THERE? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JON, THE NIGHTMARE IS REAL! THE REPEAL OF "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" HAS TURNED OUR ONCE-PROUD  ARMED FORCES INTO A CAMOUFLAGED THONG PAN-SEXUAL BACCHANAL. THIS ISN'T AN ARMY OF ONE, IT'S AN ARMY OF FUN! WHOO! (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WOW, THAT'S QUITE A GET WILL HAVE UP. WOW. THANK GOD YOU'RE ON SATELLITE. THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED A HUGE STIR IF PEOPLE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THAT OUTFIT. BUT WAIT A SECOND, JASON, SOMETHING IS NOT... WHERE ARE ALL THE SOLDIERS?
THEY... UM... UM... THEY'RE AT TRADER JOE'S! (LAUGHTER) GETTING VODKA AND CLEMENTINES. WE'RE MAKING TANGERINIS! WHOO! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JASON, THERE AREN'T ANY TRADER JOE NIECE AFGHANISTAN.
NO. I KNOW. CUT THE MUSIC, THIS IS... I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST TRYING TO LIVEN UP THE REPORT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO SOLDIERS AREN'T, BECAUSE OF THE REPEAL OF "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" WANDERING  AROUND IN CUT OFF SHORT-SHORTS.
NO, THESE ARE MINE. (LAUGHTER) ARMY REGULATIONS STILL REQUIRE ALL SHORT-SHORTS TO BE ANKLE LENGTH. AND THEY'RE TO BE CALLED PANTS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WHAT ABOUT ALL THE HAND WRINGING OVER THE CHANGES THAT  REPEALING "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" WOULD BRING? THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL WARNED THE REPEAL WOULD LEAD TO SEXUAL ASSAULTS IN THE SHOWERS.
NO. TURNS OUT REPEALING "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" DOESN'T ALL OF A SUDDEN MAKE SHOWER RAPE LEGAL. (LAUGHTER) IN FACT, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND ALL RAPES-- HOMOSEXUAL AND HETEROSEXUAL-- STILL ILLEGAL.
Jon: HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY CHANGES AT ALL?
NOT REALLY, JON. IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN CLOSE QUARTERS AND COUNT ON PROTECTING EACH OTHER LIKE  FAMILY DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW THE DEAL. IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THE REPEAL OF DON'T CAN ASK DON'T TELL AROUND HERE? "NO D'UH TUESDAY." AND GUESS WHO THE COMMANDING OFFICER WAS WHO BROKE THE NEWS  TO THEM?
Jon: WHO?
CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.
I MEAN, JON, IT WAS THE ARMY WHO INVENTED GAYDAR IN THE '06s.
Jon: SO THE BIG STORY ABOUT REPEALING "DON'T ASK, DON'T  TELL" IS THAT THERE IS NO STORY?
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. IT HASN'T MADE ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FIGHTING FORCES. TURNS OUT HONORABLE MILITARY 6-SERVICE IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY CAN SHARE.

Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVE... ♪
Jon: NO, NOT CHER! GOOD LUCK OUT THERE, JASON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) YOU KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT HE IS A LOT OF MAN. (LAUGHTER) THE END OF THE POLICY OF "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL," OF COURSE, DID  PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK BACK AT EXACTLY HOW FAR THE MILITARY HAD COME ON THE ISSUE  OF GAY SOLDIERS.
IT BEGINS IN 1950 WHEN PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN SIGNS INTO LAW THE UNIFORM CODE OF  MILITARY JUSTICE MAKING SODOMY ITSELF A CRIME.
Jon: OH, YES! HARRY TRUMAN'S FAMOUS POLICY OF THE (BLEEP) STOPPED HERE. (LAUGHTER)
YEARS LATER UNDER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN THE PENTAGON ISSUES A DIRECTIVE STATING THAT  HOMOSEXUALITY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MILITARY SERVICE.
Jon: SO THE MILITARY NEEDS DISCIPLINED WELL-GROOMED INDIVIDUALS COMFORTABLE IN  CRISPLY PRESSED COLORFUL UNIFORMS. NO PLACE FOR GAYS! (LAUGHTER) TELL 'EM, BOYS. ♪ THE PEOPLE RIDE IN A HOLE IN THE GROUND, NEW YORK, NEW YORK... ♪
Jon: GO OUT THERE AND ENJOY SOME VAGINA. (LAUGHTER) AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE WAS "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL."
IN 1993, A COMPROMISE EMERGES.
THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF HAVE AGREED TO REMOVE THE QUESTION REGARDING ONE'S SEXUAL  ORIENTATION FROM FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE ENLISTMENT APPLICATION. AND IT WILL NOT BE ASKED IN THE INTERIM.
Jon: (AS BILL CLINTON) I MEAN, IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS  WHERE YOU'RE STICKING IT, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE, YOU KNOW?
JON.
Jon: (AS B.C.) JON?
EMMY?
Jon: DID SUNDAY NIGHT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A WONDERFUL EVENING, IT MEANT A LOT TO ME.
HERE WE ARE NOT 48 HOURS LATE WE ARE A REHEATED CLINTON JOKE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STALE  LEFTOVER IN 2000. (LAUGHTER) (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU ONLY HAVE TO SUBMIT ONE EPISODE SO IT'S NOT LIKE...
I SHOULD HAVE SLEPT WITH COLBERT WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I BEAT YOU TO THAT, TOO, HUH?
YOU MONSTER!
Jon: OF COURSE THE REAL CONCERN WITH REPEALING "DON'T  ASK, DON'T TELL" WAS HOW IT WOULD ENCOURAGE IMMORALITY AND INDECENCY AND NOT A DAY AFTER  ITS REPEAL WE ALREADY SEE THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT NOW FEEL FREE TO FLAUNT THEIR LIFE-STYLE.
ONE SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN POST-ING ANONYMOUS VIDEOS ABOUT  HIS EXPERIENCE UNDER "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" CALLED HIS FATHER JUST HOURS AFTER THE REPEAL.
HELLO?
HEY, DADDY.
HEY, BUD!
CAN I TELL YOUING?
YEAH.
WILL YOU LOVE ME REGARDLESS?
YES.
YOU'LL ALWAYS LOVE ME? AS LONG AS I'M...
OF COURSE.
DAD, I'M GAY.
I STILL LOVE YOU AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. I WILL ALWAYS BE PROUD OF YOU.
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, DAD. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT KIND OF MONSTERS-- (LAUGHTER) -- HAVE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE? AND HOW DO I GET MY DAD TO HAVE SOME OF THAT? (LAUGHTER) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS
