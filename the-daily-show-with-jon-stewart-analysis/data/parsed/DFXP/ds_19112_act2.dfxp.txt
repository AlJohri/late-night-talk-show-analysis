JON: WELCOME BACK. THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION A MERE 888 DAYS AWAY. THERE IS ONE QUESTION MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING?
MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME THIS SAME QUESTION. THAT IS ARE YOU GOING TO RUN AGAIN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? [LAUGHING]
JON: I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE PEOPLE WOULD ASK. BECAUSE,  YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, IF YOU DO RUN HAVE A LOT OF PLANS TO MAKE LIKE MOVING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES OUT OF THE COUNTRY. SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKING?
MY ANSWER IS HONESTLY THIS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, BUT I KNOW WHO HOLDS THE FUTURE. THAT'S GOD ALMIGHTY. [LAUGHING]
JON: SO YOU WILL RUN? [LAUGHING]
JON: SO YOU WILL RUN? BUT ONLY IF GOD SAYS TO. GOING FOR THE OLD JEHOVAH BUMP. WELL, IF I MAY SAY, I REALLY HOPE THAT GOD TELLS YOU TO. BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.
HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF --
JON: THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I WOULD LIKE THAT.
9-9-9.
JON: YA 9-9-9. THAT'S ANOTHER SOLID REASON.
THESE WORDS CAME FROM THE POKEMON MOVIE.
OK, LIBYA.
CALL ME HAAGEN DAZ BLACK WALNUT.
OH, SHUCKY DUCKY.
JON: I LOVE IT. LET ME SAY THIS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS MAN RUN FOR PRESIDENT. BUT, LIKE HE SAID ONLY GOD CAN TELL HIM TO DO THAT. SO, UHHH. CALLS FOR DESPERATE MEASURES. GOD, MEET ME AT CAMERA THREE, PLEASE. ARE YOU THERE, GOD? HELLO, IT'S ME. JON STEWART. YOU MAY HAVE IT IN YOUR ROLODEX AS LEIBOWITZ. I DON'T KNOW THE FORM YOU WERE GOING TO GO WITH, IF YOU WANTED THAT NAME OR THE OTHER NAME. I MEAN, NEW TESTAMENT, OLD TESTAMENT IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATION. IT'S BEEN A WHILE, YOU KNOW, SINCE YOU AND I TALKED. AFTER THE BAR MITZVAH CHECKS CLEARED I KIND OF GOT OUT OF THE BUSINESS. I HEAR YOU'RE BIG ON FORGIVENESS. HERE GOES NOTHING. OUR LORD WHO AREN'T IN HEAVEN -- I HAVE TO HAVE THIS. AMEN. SO, DOES THAT DO IT? DO I HAVE TO THROW IN A OFFERING, LAMB SHANK? BUILD AN ARCH OUT OF LAMB SHANKS? HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN "BOOK OF MORMON"? I CAN GET YOU TICKETS FOR "BOOK OF MORMON." I CAN GET YOU TICKETS FOR "BOOK OF MORMON" FOR 2017. IT'S A VERY POPULAR SHOW. THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK. I'M A JUST A LAPSED JEW ON BASIC CABLE. I'M SURE HE PROBABLY KNOWS I CELEBRATE PASSOVER WITH A BACON, EGG AND CHEESE SANDWICH EVERY YEAR. GOD IS NEVER GOING TO WORK HIS MAGIC TO CONVINCE HERMAIN CAIN TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. BUT YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT. HERMAN, I HOPE YOU'RE WATCHING. GOD HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO SAY TO YOU.
HELLO, HERMAN CAIN. THIS IS GOD. LISTEN UP. RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CRAWL THROUGH A RIVER OF [BLEEP] AND COME OUT CLEAN ON THE OTHER SIDE.
JON: YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT LAST PART, BUT RUN FOR PRESIDENT. PLEASE. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
