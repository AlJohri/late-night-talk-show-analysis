Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A NICE ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. BILL DEDMAN, AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK, EMPTY MANSIONS. BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND WATCHING THE SHOW. I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION AT THE TOP: ARE WE AT WAR YET?  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DOES ANYONE KNOW. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES GAVE AN ADDRESS, ADDRESSED THE NATION ON SYRIA JUST NOT TWO HOURS AGO. [LAUGHTER]
I DIDN'T WATCH IT. I WAS AT MY TWERKING CLASS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. BUT THE PRESIDENT GAVE HIS SPEECH. AND IT'S ABOUT THE WAR IN SYRIA. IF YOU REMEMBER CORRECTLY, ABOUT A YEAR AGO, IN THE HEAT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, A HYPOTHETICAL WAS POSITED ABOUT WHAT IT MAY TAKE TO GET THE UNITED STATES INVOLVED IN A SYRIAN CIVIL WAR. THIS IS DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
President Obama: A RED LINE FOR US IS WE START SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS MOVING AROUND OR BEING UTILIZED.
Jon: SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IT LOOKS LIKE ASSAD HAS USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS, AND THAT -- THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE CAMPAIGN PROMISE OBAMA HAS DECIDED TO KEEP. SO... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WITH THAT OFF-HAND HYPOTHETICAL STATEMENT, SO BEGAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S MARCH TO ACTION. ODDLY ENOUGH, ONCE AGAIN UTILIZING DRONES TO MAKE HIS CASE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OBAMA HIMSELF APPEARED YESTERDAY IN BACK-TO-BACK TO BACK-TO-BACK INTERVIEWS, WITH SIX SEPARATE NETWORKS MAKING HIS CASE FOR INTERVENTION, MOVIE-JUNKET-STYLE. NO. COME ON. YEAH, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF AIR STRIKES. NO. WE CAN DO BETTER -- STOP OR OBAMA WILL SHOOT. THANK YOU. REALLY, YOU LIKED THE CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF AIR STRIKES? OBVIOUSLY, THE JOURNALISTS CHOSEN TO INTERVIEW THE PRESIDENT WERE SELECTED FOR THEIR GRAVITAS AND PROFESSIONALISM. EXCEPT ONE WHO APPARENTLY WON A RADIO CONTEST.
YOU'RE BEING SEEN RIGHT NOW ON CNN AND CNN INTERNATIONAL AROUND THE WORLD.
OOH, YOU'RE ON CNN. AAHHH! YOU KNOW, OBAMA IS, LIKE, I'M ON TV! HI, MOM! [LAUGHTER]
Jon: BUT THAT'S NOT THE STUPID PART.
AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN DAMASCUS. WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO, MR. PRESIDENT, LOOK INTO THE CAMERA, TALK DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT BASHAR al-ASSAD --
Jon: AND THAT'S THE STUPID PART.
-- TELL HIM SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU THINK HE MUST DO TO AVERT A U.S. MILITARY STRIKE.
Jon: AND WHY YOU THINK HE DESERVES THE FINAL ROSE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: [BLEEP] MAN, IT'S AN INTERVIEW. STOP TRYING TO MAKE MOMENTS. YOU'RE TELLING THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD HOW WE MIGHT AVOID A POSSIBLE WORLD WAR III. YOU DON'T NEED TO AMP UP THE DRAMA WITH THEATRICS. SERIOUSLY, LOOK INTO THE CAMERA AND HAVE FUN WITH IT. TRY IT WITH THIS LINCOLN BEARD ON. GO AHEAD. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OBAMA, MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE POLITELY DISMISS THIS REQUEST WHILE MAKING IT CLEAR HOW INCREDIBLY (bleep) STUPID YOU THINK IT IS.
President Obama: I DON'T NEED TO TALK IN THE CAMERA. I SUSPECT HE HAS PEOPLE WHO WILL BE WATCHING THIS.
Jon: I CANNOT BELIEVE ASSAD USES CNN ON HIS OWN PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HE IS A MONSTER! [APPLAUSE] [CHEERING]
Jon: BUT YOU KNOW, WE GOT INTO THIS PICKLE FROM AN ILL-THOUGHT OUT HYPOTHETICAL STATEMENT, A RED LINE, SO PERHAPS THE ONLY WAY OUT IS WITH AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE ILL-THOUGHT OUT HYPOTHETICAL STATEMENT, ACCORDING TO NEWTON'S THEORY OF RELATIVE STUPIDITY. BUT WHAT KIND OFA MAGOO-ESQUE ACCIDENTAL GENIUS COULD BUMBLE [BLEEP] THEIR WAY INTO DIPLOMATIC SUCCESS -- HELLO, IT'S JOHN KERRY TO THE RESCUE. SECRETARY KERRY. [APPLAUSE]
Jon: IN THE MIDDLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF PRESENTING KERRY'S SLAM-DUNK CASE AS TO WHY WE ABSOLUTELY MUST ATTACK SYRIA, HE INADVERTENTLY MAY HAVE FOUND AN INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTABLE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION.
IS THERE ANYTHING AT THIS POINTS THAT HIS GOVERNMENT COULD DO OR OFFER THAT WOULD STOP AN ATTACK?
SURE. HE COULD TURN OVER EVERY SINGLE BIT OF HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE NEXT WEEK. TURN IT OVER, ALL OF IT. WITHOUT DELAY. AND ALLOW A FULL AND TOTAL ACCOUNTING FOR THAT. BUT HE ISN'T ABOUT TO DO IT, IT CAN'T BE DONE, OBVIOUSLY.
Jon: CAN'T BE DONE! CAN'T! IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN! NO WAY. CAN'T BE DONE! AND JUST TO DRIVE THE POINT HOME AS TO HOW RIDICULOUS THIS POSSIBILITY WAS, THE STATE DEPARTMENT QUICKLY CALLED THAT A RHETORICAL ARGUMENT, AND NOT A REAL PROPOSAL FROM KERRY. THEY HAD TO MAKE A SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT TO SAY, HEY, BY THE WAY, HE WAS JUST BEING CONDESCENDING AND SARCASTIC. GUESS WHICH MIDDLE EASTERN DESPOT DOESN'T APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND RHETORICAL ANSWERS.
SYRIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS THE COUNTRY, QUOTE,"WELCOMES A PROPOSAL TO PUT ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONTROL."
Jon: MAGOO, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
EXCUSE ME, YOUNG MAN.
Jon: OH, (bleep). SYRIA IS TAKING HIM UP ON HIS DICKISH OFFER. SYRIA, THROUGH THE AUSPICES OF VLADIMIR PUTIN'S RUSSIA, WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S AND SECRETARY KERRY'S OFFER TO TAKE THEIR WEAPONS FOR THEM. NO WAR, NO COST, NO BLOWBACK. HOW COULD ANY PATRIOT VIEW THIS BUT ANYTHING BUT A FANTASTIC DEVELOPMENT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS JUST LED US INTO A HUMILIATING DEFEAT.
Jon: WHO DO WE LOSE TO? SANITY? YOU BEAT US THIS TIME, RATIONAL FORETHOUGHT, BUT WE'LL GET YOU. WHO CARES HOW WE AVOIDED A WAR AND GOT A DICTATOR TO GIVE UP HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS, IF WE AVOIDED A WAR AND GOT A DICTATOR TO GIVE UP HIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
THIS STRENGTHENS RUSSIA AND HUMILIATES THE UNITED STATES.
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS FILLED THE LEADERSHIP GAP.
I THINK LINDSAY GRAHAM IS ON THE TAPE SAYING THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE PLAYED US LIKE A FIDDLE.
THEY'RE THE NEW TOP OF THE WORLD AND WE'RE NOT. IT IS DESPICABLE.
NOW, HAVE WE HANDED THE POWER BACK OVER TO THE SHIRTLESS, PUTIN.
Jon: TWO THINGS, ONE, WAS THAT GUY IN A COW SUIT? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL NEWS. AND NUMBER TWO, OH, PUTIN GETS THE CREDIT. IF WE CAUGHT CHARLIE MANSON WHO GIVES A (bleep) WHO GETS THE CREDIT. AND I GET THAT FOX OPPOSES THE SYRIA PEACE PLAN BECAUSE ITS MODUS OPERANDI IS TO FOMENT DISSENT IN THE FORM OF A RELENTLESS AND IRRATIONAL CONTRARIANISM TO BARACK OBAMA AND ALL THINGS DEMOCRATIC TO ADVANCE ITS ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF CREATING DELIBERATELY MISINFORMED BODY POLITIC WHOSE ANGER, FEAR MISTRUST AND DISCONTENT IS THE MANNA ON WHICH IT SUSTAINS ITS PARASITIC SUCCUBUS-LIKE EXISTENCE. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE]
Jon: I BLACKED OUT FOR A SECOND. WAS I SAYING SOMETHING? BUT FOR SOME REASON, EVEN CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TURN OF EVENTS.
A RUSSIAN PROPOSAL TO HAVE SYRIA HAND OVER ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS COULD CHANGE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS. IT COULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE DEBATE, BUT SHOULD IT?
Jon: SHOULD IT? ON ONE HAND, GEOPOLITICAL REALITY JUST SHIFTED 100%. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE BUILT THIS GRAPHIC. ♪♪♪ [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LOOK, ISN'T THAT THE PROBLEM NOW? NEWS NETWORKS AREN'T INVESTED IN RIGHT OR WRONG. THEY'RE INVESTED IN MOMENTUM. YOU CAN TAKE US TO WAR ON FALSE INTELLIGENCE AND PRETENSE, BUT GOD FORBID YOU REV US UP FOR WAR AND YOU DON'T DELIVER. THE ONE THING IN THIS COUNTRY WE WON'T TOLERATE IS A LITTLE WAR FOREPLAY WITHOUT THE PAYOFF. YOU CAN MAKE DISASTROUS FOREIGN POLICY DECISIONS, BUT YOU WILL NOT GIVE THIS COUNTRY A CASE OF BLUE BOMBS. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
