(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW, AMERICA IS PRETTY HARD ON ITS YOUTH THESE DAYS AND RIGHTFULLY SO.
MILLENNIALS, YOU MIGHT CALL THEM LAZY.
ALWAYS TEXTING AND TWEETING.
LAZY. FECKLESS.
THEY LIVE IN THEIR PARENTS' BASEMENT.
THEY WOULD RATHER BE UNEMPLOYED THAN TAKE A JOB THAT THEY THINK IS BENEATH THEM.
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THEM.
Jon: THEY SUCK! ALL OF THEM! EVERY YOUNG PERSON -- WELL, EXCEPT FOR ONE. BUT SHE'S THE ONLY ONE. EVERYONE ELSE SUCKS. BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR REPUTATION AS LAZY, SUPERFICIAL, BASEMENT-DEALING PARASITES WHO HAVE BEEN TOLD THEIR PERFECT SPECIAL LITTLE SNOWFLAKES WHO DESERVE THEIR OWN REALITY SHOWS. THIS GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE COULD BE OUR GREATEST WEAPON IN THE WAR ON TERROR.
IN RECENT MONTHS, I.S.I.S. HAS RECRUITED THOUSANDS OF BRAND-NEW MEMBERS AND MANY FROM WESTERN COUNTRIES, SOME OF THEM ARE TEENS!
Jon: MILLENNIALS. THAT'S RIGHT. MILLENNIALS HAVE BEEN TROJAN HORSED INTO THE WAR ON TERROR. WAIT UNTIL THESE BRUTAL FUNDAMENTALISTS OF I.S.I.S. GET A TASTE OF THE ENTITLEMENT GENERATION.
THERE ARE A LOT OF DISILLUSIONED RECRUITS.
LEAKED EMAILS SHOW SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE JOINING ARE COMPLAINING. THIS IS MAJEED. HE WENT TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE I.S.I.S., BUT INSTEAD ENDED UP CLEANING TOILETS.
OTHER SAY THAT THEY'RE SICK OF HAVING TO SERVE FOOD AND FIGHT EVEN IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW.
SURPRISED TO FIND TERRORISTS  DON'T PROVIDE PROPER HEALTHCARE.
Jon: FIRST, I.S.I.S. SAID IF I LIKED MY DOCTOR I COULD KEEP MY DOCTOR. THEN HE SAID HE WAS AN INFIDEL AND I HAD TO KILL HIM! I MEAN, WHICH IS IT? SORRY, I.S.I.S., KIDS DON'T CLEAN, THEY DON'T FIGHT, AND THEY DON'T STAY ON THEIR PARENTS HEALTHCARE PLAN UNTIL THEY'RE 26. WE JUST BEAT I.S.I.S. AND WE DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT. HERE'S WHAT CONVINCE MED.
ANOTHER QUOTE, I'M FED UP, MY iPod DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE HERE. I HAVE TO COME BACK.
Jon: BOOM! THE PEOPLE I.S.I.S. IS RECRUITING WILL DO ANYTHING TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF ESTABLISHING AN ETERNAL ISLAMIST CALIPHATE UNLESS THEIR IPODS BREAK! THIS IS WHEN THE VALUES COME INTO CONFLICT. IT'S NOT WITNESSING BRUTALITY FIRST HAND THAT'S PUTTING A WEDGE BETWEEN THEM AND JIHAD, IT'S THEY CAN'T LISTEN TO TAYLOR SWIFT'S NEW ALBUM! I FEEL BAD FOR THEM. IT'S GENRE SMASHING. ALL I CAN SAY IS, I.S.I.S, IF YOU'RE UPSET WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE YOU'RE GETTING, YOU BROUGHT THIS ON YOURSELF.
I.S.I.S. EFFECTIVELY RECRUITS WITH VIDEOS THAT HAVE ALL THE PRODUCTION VALUE OF A HOLLYWOOD ACTION MOVIE.
TWEETS TELLING READERS TO PUT DOWN THE CHICKEN WINGS AND COME TO JIHAD, BRO.
Jon: JUST REINFORCES THE BELIEF THAT YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE THAT USES THE TERM "BRO." (LAUGHTER) BUT, HEY, ONCE I.S.I.S. REALIZES WHO THEY'RE DEALING WITH THEY'LL SEND THEM BACK.
ONE FRENCHMAN WAS RUMORED TO HAVE BEEN BEHEADED WHEN HE EXPLAINED TO HIS EMIR THAT HE WANTED TO FOLLOW HIS FRIEND WHO HAD ALREADY LEFT.
Jon: OH RIGHT, I FORGOT. NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT HAVE HEALTHCARE, THEY HAVE A REALLY TOUGH SEVERANCE PACKAGE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
