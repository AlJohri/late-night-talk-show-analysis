FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: BOOM. WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT THE FINE ACTRESS IS ELIZABETH OLSEN. MANY OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS MASHE'S THE YOUNGER SISTER OF FAMED CUB REPORTER JIMMY OLSEN. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT FIRST MAN IT'S BEEN A ROUGH BCOUPLE OF WEEKS FOR PRESIDENTH BARACK OBAMA. MONTHS REALLY. HIS FOREIGN ALLIES ARE ANGRY WITH HIM BECAUSE WE ARE SPYING ON THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] HIS DOMESTIC ALLIES ARE ANGRY AT HIM BECAUSE OF INCOMPETENT HEALTH CARE ROLLOUT. HE TAPED OVER HIS WEDDING VIDEO RECENTLY. HE WAS TRYING TO RECORD A VERY SPECIAL "TWO BROKE GIRLS." HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT, THEY ARE ALL SPECIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THIS WEEKEND WAS BOOED AT A BASKETBALL GAME. [AUDIENCE REACTS] AND NOW HERE IN MY STUDIO OR WAS THAT SOMETHING ELSE. [LAUGHTER] TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHERE THINGS ARE FOR THE PRESIDENT, THIS IS HOW A CROWD GREETED THE CRACK SMOKING TRAIN WRECK OF A MAYOR IN TORONTO ON SATURDAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: YOU ARE AN IDIOT! [LAUGHTER] AND THAT WAS BEFORE MAYOR FORD'S MONDAY ADVENTURE.
WE HAVE GOT SOME ANGRY EXCHANGES WHILE THE MEETING WAS GOING ON THE MAYOR -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DO NOT GET IN BETWEEN ME AND MY CRACK! [LAUGHTER] I WILL KNOCK YOU OVER. [ LAUGHTER ] [ LAUGHTER ] IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE WHAT A LOW POINT THIS IS IN BARACK OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY. HARD TO OVERSTATE BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA NOW FINDS HIMSELF COMPARED TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH AS IN THE PROBLEMS WITH THE HEALTH CARE PLAN HAVE BECOME PRESIDENT OBAMA'S KATRINA.
IS THIS OBAMA'S KATRINA MOMENT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S KATRINA MOMENT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: HURRICANE KATRINA? I BELIEVE WE'VE ALL SEEN THE DAMNING PHOTOS OF PRESIDENTIAL FLYOVER SURVEYING THE HUMAN SUFFERING OF THE HEALTHCARE.GOV WEB SITE FROM A SAFE DISTANCE. I'M NOT TRYING TO POLISH THE DOT TURD THAT IS HEALTHCARE.GOV BUT COMPARING THE GOVERNMENT ABDICATION OF RESPONSIBILITY DURING HURRICANE KATRINA, DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, THE DISPLACEMENT OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO A  (bleep) WEB SITE IS OFFENSIVE APPARENTLY TO THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE DURING HURRICANE KATRINA. C
KATRINA WAS A REAL DISASTER. BUT WE ALSO HAD JURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGES BECAUSE WE HAD A MAYOR. WE HAD A GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA THAT WAS A CHALLENGE TO WORK WITH.
THAT IS ANDY CARD SAYING IT'S NOT FAIR TO PRESIDENT BUSH TO COMPARE THE HEALTHCARE.GOV ROLLOUT TO KATRINA BECAUSE DURING KATRINA BUSH DIDN'T GET THE COOPERATION OF LOUISIANA GOVERNOR THE WAY OBAMA GETS IT NOW.
NOBODY IS GOING TO BULLY LOUISIANA INTO JOINING PART OF OBAMACARE.
Jon: BULLYING? THE FEDS WERE GOING TO PAY FOR IT? HOW WAS THAT BULLYING? HEY FOUREYES YOU NEED TO SEE AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST SO WE CAN COVER THAT THAT'S NOT ONLY REASON THE COMPARISON IS UNFAIR TO GEORGE W. BUSH.
GEORGE BUSH DIDN'T INVENT A HURRICANE.
KATRINA WAS ONE REGION.
LORD KNOWS YOU SAW HOW BADLY OUR GOVERNMENT RESPONDED. IT BEGAN AND ENDED WITHIN A WEEK. IT COULD EFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR YEARS TO COME.
Jon: SEE HOW YOU DISAPPOINTED OUR AUDIENCE. THEY THINK YOU MIGHT BE OUT OF YOUR (bleep) MIND. I MEAN -- HURRICANE KATRINA LASTED A WEEK AND EFFECTS OF OBAMACARE. SPIKE LEE'S DOCUMENTARY ABOUT KATRINA LASTED LONGER THAN A WEEK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR MORE INSIGHT WE GO TO THE BEST (bleep) NEWS PANEL JASON JONES, SAM BEE AND AL MADRIGAL. LET'S TALK QUICKLY. I KNOW THE WEB SITE LAUNCH HAS BEEN ROCKY BUT IS IT FAIR TO COMPARE HEALTHCARE.GOV TO KATRINA?
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO, JON. I MEAN YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL (bleep) WITHOUT SOMEHOW BRINGING UP GEORGE W. BUSH. HE JUST HAD SO MANY. IT'S LIKE TALKING ABOUT ROCK 'N' ROLL WITHOUT BRINGING UP ELVIS, GOTTA RESPECT THE KING.
Jon: CAN'T WE FIND A BUSH FIASCO THAT ISN'T QUITE SO CALLOUS OR HYPERBOLIC?
OF COURSE THERE'S GUANTANAMO, MY PET GOAT, THE VALERIE PLAME LEAK. BUSH LEFT US WITH A WHITMAN'S SAMPLER OF PRESIDENTIAL TURDS TO CHOOSE FROM.
I SEE IT AS THE WATERBOARDING. HEALTH CARE.GOV IS THE TOWEL WRAPPING AROUND OUR FACES AND THE BOARD IS THE FAILED PROMISE OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE.
Jon: AH -- WELL WHAT IS THE WATER?
I DON'T KNOW, WATER IS WATER, JON. WHAT AM I ROBERT FROST.
OBAMACARE IS OBAMA'S 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS. IT'S THE PERFECT 1 TO 1. THAT WAS BAD. THIS IS BAD BOOM DONE.
I HAVE TO GO WITH THE CLASSICS I SAT THE WEB SITE IS OBAMA'S IRAQ WAR BECAUSE WHEN I THINK GLITCHY WEB SITE THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS DECADE LONG WARS STARTED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE ALL REMEMBER THAT PRESS CONFERENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ACTUALLY THAT -- IF I MAY, AL, THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
YEAH, BUT IT COULD HAVE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR A COMPARISON ISN'T OBAMACARE MOST LIKE BUSH'S MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. IT WAS A ROLLOUT, FLAWED A LARGE CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM BUT ULTIMATELY WOUND UP BEING REPAIRED AND WORKING WELL.
THAT IS A STUPID COMPARISON, JON. MEDICARE PART D DIDN'T MURDER ANYBODY.
Jon: BUT OBAMACARE DIDN'T MURDER ANYBODY EITHER.
YET. NO ONE REMEMBERS THAT PROGRAM. SO MANY TASTY TURDS AND YOU PICK THE ONE THE RASPBERRY FILLING THAT COMPARISON IS YOUR STUPID FACE DOING THE STUPID FACE DANCE, RIGHT?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT --
REMEMBER, NO? THAT STUPID DANCE YOU DID WITH THE STUPID FACE THAT WAS SO STUPID.
Jon: OH, YEAH. I DO REMEMBER THAT ACTUALLY.
I FEEL BAD FOR YOUR MIRROR.
GOD YOUR FACE IS SO STUPID.
STUPID FACE. YOU KNOW METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING. LOOK AT IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: IT IS PRETTY (bleep) STUPID. SAMANTHA BEE, JASON JONES, AL MADRIGAL.
