[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO AS WE'VE SEEN LAST NIGHT WAS LESS ABOUT THE STATE OF  OUR UNION AND MORE ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR PRESIDENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CONGRESS, THE SUBTEXT OF THE PRESIDENT'S FRUSTRATION, HIS IRRITATION, HIS DISLIKE HIS MURDEROUS HATRED. IT ACTUALLY NOW APPEARS TO BE BLEEDING INTO ACTUAL TEXT.
I'M EAGER TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU BUT AMERICA DOES NOT STAND STILL AND NEITHER WILL I. SO WHEREVER AND WHENEVER I CAN TAKE STEPS WITHOUT LEGISLATION TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
Jon: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT (bleep) ALL Y'ALL. [LAUGHTER] OF COURSE, THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE.
WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT. WE'RE HOPEFUL MAYBE HE WILL SIT DOWN AND WORK WITH US.
WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT WORK WITH US.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT, UNFORTUNATELY, CONTINUES TO DIVIDE THE COUNTRY.
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TWO PARTIES TO COME TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT. INSTEAD IT WAS THE SAME TIRED BOILER PLATE WE HEAR YEAR AFTER YEAR.
Jon: UH, YEP. WE SURE DO. [ LAUGHTER ] UH, YEP.
Jon: THEY ARE REALLY HURT. THEY ARE HURT. THEIR FEELINGS ARE HURT. THE PRESIDENT HAS HURT THEIR FEELINGS. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THEIR -- WE JUST WANT TO WORK WITH THEM IS THAT IT'S TOTAL (bleep). IT'S (bleep). PREMIUM GRADE A GRASS FED FREE RANGE (bleep) COLLECTED AND PACKAGED BY HAND. NO HEAR ME OUT! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT IS (bleep) COLLECTED AND PACKAGED BY HAND FROM THE POLISHED ANUSES OF AWARD WINNING TEXAS LONGHORNS THAT HAVE BEEN BRED FOR PERFECTION SO THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL DOOKIE MEETS THE EXACTING STANDARDS OF THE AMERICAN (bleep) ASSOCIATION. IT IS (bleep). LISTEN TO RAND PAUL.
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY. THAT'S NOT THE TONE OF SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO WORK WITH CONGRESS.
Jon: TONE. EVERYTHING WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF HE USED A DIFFERENT TONE? TONE -- NO, FORGET THAT. DURING THIS YEAR'S STATE OF THE UNION CONGRESSMEN FROM THE OPPOSITION WERE TWEETING THINGS LIKE COMMANDANT AND CHIEF OR CHEF AS HE PUT IT. AND A SOCIALISTIC DICTATOR.  FORGET THAT CONGRESSMAN STEVE STOCKMAN GOT UP AND WALKED OUT. EVEN THE GUY WHO SHOUTED YOU LIE SAT THROUGH THE (bleep) THING. FORGET THAT THESE REPUBLICANS HAVE FILIBUSTERED MORE THAN ANY CONGRESS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR REPUBLIC, THAT THIS CONGRESS ACCOMPLISHED LESS THAN THAN ANY IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC, DEFUNDING INITIATIVES FORGET ALL THAT HERE IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SENSITIVE REPUBLICAN SOULS SO HURT BY THE PRESIDENT'S NEWFOUND LACK OF INTEREST IN BIPARTISANSHIP BEFORE OBAMA WAS INAUGURATED SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL SAID MAKE A PUBLIC SHOW OF WANTING TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT BLOCK HIM AT ANY TURN IN ORDER TO DENY HIM VICTORIES FOR WHICH OBAMA WILL BE BLAMED BECAUSE HE IS THE GUY THAT RAN ON BIPARTISANSHIP. UH, YEP AND AS SENATOR VOINOVICH WROTE IF OBAMA WAS FOR IT, WE HAD TO BE AGAINST IT SO.
IF HE GIVES IT THE MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY AND I'M GOING TO GO AROUND THE CONGRESS WE'LL HAVE A BIG PROBLEM.
Jon: NO, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAD A BIG (bleep) PROBLEM BECAUSE ON HIS FIRST INAUGURAL NIGHT WERE AT A STEAKHOUSE DINNER AND SWORE ALLEGIANCE TO OBSTRUCTION AND POSSIBLY THE ATKINS DIET. IT WAS A STEAKHOUSE. SERIOUSLY PAUL NO BODY FAT. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? THIS NOTION THAT REPUBLICANS ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT IS A GAME THAT THEY PLAY. IT'S A PLAY THEY PUT ON FOR THE CAMERAS BUT WHO ARE THEY REALLY WHEN THEY THINK THE CAMERAS ARE NOT ON. PERHAPS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMM OF STATEN ISLAND CAN CLUE US IN.
FINALLY BEFORE WE LET YOU GO SINCE WE HAVE YOU HERE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT.
I'M NOT DISCUSSING ANYTHING OFF TOPIC I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE SPEECH.
CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL GRIMM DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS CONCERNING HIS CAMPAIGN FINANCES. HE WANTED TO GET HIM ON CAMERA BUT YOU HE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT THAT. BACK TO YOU.
LET ME BE CLEAR TO YOU, (bleep). (INAUDIBLE).
Jon: TO BE FAIR, I WILL THROW YOU OFF THIS (bleep) BALCONY IS A RELATIVELY STANDARD STATEN ISLAND GOODBYE. IT IS CONSIDERED -- IF I MAY, I'VE BEEN THERE FREQUENTLY IT'S CONSIDERED THEIR CIAO. TAKE CARE GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'LL THROW YOU OFF A [BLEEP] BALCONY. HOW ARE YOU PARENTS DOING? I CAN'T WAIT TO THROW THEM OFF A (bleep) BALCONY. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW WHAT IS ALMOST MORE UPSETTING THAN KNOWING THAT REPUBLICANS PLANNED TO  SABOTAGE THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE GUY THREATENING TO HURL A REPORTER OFF A BALCONY IS NOT A THUG IN A BATMAN FILM BUT A MAN WE ELECTED TO CONGRESS. IT'S THAT HE WENT AFTER A NY1 REPORTER. NY1. [ LAUGHTER ] NY1 IS THE PULSE OF OUR CITY. FROM THE LATEST THEATER OPENINGS TO THE LATEST SUBWAY CLOSINGS, TO THEM JUST LITERALLY SITTING THERE READING YOU THE PAPER. THEY READ IT TO YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE YOU ARE A LITTLE BABY. [ LAUGHTER ] NY1 IS ALWAYS THERE FOR US. IT'S THE CHANNEL MY CABLE BOX REBOOTS TO. SO THAT NO MATTER WHAT I WAS WATCHING, IT SAYS HEY, GUESS WHO WAS JUST MURDERED IN BROOKLYN? IT GIVES US WEATHER ON THE 1S, THE 1S, NOT THE 2S BECAUSE THE 2S IS FOR SUCKERS, FOR LOSERS, FOR (bleep) PHILADELPHIA. THAT'S WHO IT'S FOR! IT'S THE 1S. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO BEFORE YOU THROW THAT REPORTER OFF A BALCONY, CONGRESSMAN, JUST KNOW THAT ONCE WE HEAR ABOUT IT FROM NY1'S THE BALCONY MURDER REPORT. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'RE COMING AFTER YOU BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T FOR THE GREATNESS OF NY1, WE COULD HAVE CANCELED OUR TIME WARNER SUBSCRIPTIONS A LONG TIME AGO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
