[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK! YOU KNOW, WE AMERICANS -- WE AMERICANS GIVE TO CHARITY FOR MANY REASONS. TO HELP THE NEEDY. FURTHER A GOOD CAUSE. SOME CORPORATIONS HAVE FOUND OTHER REASONS TO DO THIS ACT OF GIVING. SAMANTHA BEE REPORTS.
EVERY FALL AN AVALANCHE OF PINK RIBBON PRODUCTS HIT THE SHELVES. AMERICANS CAN EAT, DRINK, FRESHEN THEIR BREATH, PEPPER SPRAY EACH OTHER AND SHOOT STUFF ALL TO RAISE MONEY IN AWARENESS FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST BREAST CANCER. BUT KARUNA JAGGAR OF BREAST CANCER ACTION ISN'T BUYING IT.
THE PUBLIC CARES ABOUT BREAST CANCER, AND THEY SHOULD. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS COMPANIES ARE REALLY EXPLOITING PEOPLES GOOD INTENTIONS. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE. THIS IS ABOUT THEIR BOTTOM LINE.
I NEED SOME PINK YOGURT FOR THIS CHICKEN.
DESPITE THE BILLION THAT'S HAVE BEEN SPENT ON PINK RIBBON PRODUCTS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SHOP OUR WAY OUT OF THE BREAST CANCER EPIDEMIC.
OH, MY GOD. YOU MEAN THIS ISN'T HELPING? WHY DID YOU MAKE ME EAT THIS?
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO DO THAT.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? THESE PINK PRODUCTS ARE NOT HURTING ANYBODY, GENERALLY SPEAKING.
BAKER HUGHES, ONE OF AMERICA'S LEADING ENERGY SERVICE COMPANIES IS DOING OUR BIT FOR THE CURE. SUPPORTING SUZANNE G. KOMEN TO END BREAST CANCER FOREVER.
THAT'S RIGHT. PINK FRACKING.
WE CALLED IT THE MOST LUDICROUS PIECE OF PINK [BEEP] WE HAVE SEEN ALL YEAR.
WHY AREN'T YOU HAPPY? WE'VE NEVER BEEN MORE AWARE.
UNFORTUNATELY, THESE PINK DRILL BITS ARE DOING MORE TO CAUSE CANCER THAN TO CURE IT.
750 DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IN FRACKING FLUIDS.
KNOWN CARCINOGENS.
FROM BENZENE TO FERMALDEHYDE.
TOXIC CHEMICALS.
LINKED TO CANCER AND OTHER SERIOUS ILLNESSES.
OKAY, HERE IS MY AWARENESS BONER.
YEAH.
COME ON IF FRACKING CHEMICALS WERE REALLY THAT BAD. KOMEN WOULD BE SO PISSED WHEN THEY FOUND OUT.
EVEN ON KOMEN'S OWN WEBSITE SOME OF THE CHEMICALS USED IN FRACKING ARE LISTED AND IDENTIFIED FOR THEIR LINKS TO BREAST CANCER.
OKAY. THAT'S NOT REAL. NO, THAT'S TOO STUPID.
THERE IS NO WAY KOMEN'S WEBSITE WARNS OF, OH EXCUSE ME, THERE IT IS. OH, OKAY. GAS INDUSTRY EXPERT JAZZ SHAW THINKS IT'S ALL GOOD.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A CURE FOR CANCER AND YOU TURN AROUND AND SAY WHY ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO CURE CANCER DOING BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE WHO CAUSE CANCER. I THINK THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
ISN'T IT JUST A TINY, INTSY BIT WEIRD.
THE MONEY ISN'T CAUSING CANCER. THE MONEY IS STILL MONEY.
FAIR POINT. BAKER HUGHES DID DIG DEEP INTO THEIR COMICALLY LARGE CHECKBOOK FOR THEIR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR DONATION.
WOMEN WITH METASTATIC DISEASE THAT ARE GONNA BE IN TREATMENT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES CAN SPEND $130,000 AND MORE EACH YEAR FOR TREATMENT.
WHAT I'M HEARING IS, THIS DONATION COULD LITERALLY BE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THREE QUARTERS OF A HUMAN LIFE.
BAKER HUGHES IS SPENDING MORE MONEY TO PAINT THESE DRILL BITS PINK AND PROMOTE THEMSELVES THAN THEY ARE ACTUALLY MAKING A BREAST CANCER DONATION.
BUT JAZZ SHAW THINK SHE'S LOOKING AT IT ALL WRONG.
ISN'T IT A LITTLE BIT JUSTICE IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING AROUND CAUSING CANCER THAT YOU TAKE SOME MONEY AWAY FROM THEM TO HELP CURE IT.
OH. WE DON'T NEED TO STOP THIS. WHAT HAVE I BEEN THINKING? I FEEL LIKE SUCH A DING DONG.
THESE PINK DRILL BITS HAVE CHANGED THE GAME. I'M ABOUT TO TURN YOUR RINKY DINK OPERATION INTO A MAGIC MONEY MAKING MACHINE. OH. BETTER. I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT OPTIMIZING THE HEALTH RISK-OTUNITIES. HOW MANY CARCINOGENS DOES A FRACKING COMPANY USE?
HUNDREDS.
YOU COULD BE MAKING MONEY OFF OF EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL CARCINOGEN. PINK BENZENE. OPEN IT. >>NO, THANK YOU.
PINK RIBBON ZERO SPF SUN SCREEN. I CALL IT MELANOMA MIST. RADIOACTIVE WASTE. I SWITCHED IT OUT. IT'S PINK NOW.
TIME TO SHOW HER HOW TO TURN PINK INTO COLD HARD GREEN. EVERY RADIOACTIVE DUMP SITE, SMOKE STACK AND POLLUTED CANAL COULD POISONING THE PLANET FOR THE CURE.
LOOK AT ALL OF THE POSSIBILITIES.
I COULD NEVER TAKE MONEY FROM THESE TOXIC INDUSTRIES.
ALRIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? [BLEEP] IT. [BLEEP] IT. I HAVE HAD IT. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LET HER CYNICISM KEEP ME FROM DOING MY PART. WOO! AWARENESS MOTHER [BLEEP]!
Jon: WOW, SAMANTHA BEE. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
