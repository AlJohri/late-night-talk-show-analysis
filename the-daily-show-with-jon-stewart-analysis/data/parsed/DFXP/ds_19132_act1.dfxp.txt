FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY NICE SHOW. TONIGHT'S GUEST, LISTEN TO ME, MEN, RICHARD LINKLATER. HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THIS MOVIE "BOYHOOD," WHICH IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET, TURN OFF THE TV. [LAUGHTER] LEAVE THE HOUSE AND GO SEE IT. IT IS WONDERFUL. BUT FIRST, AS YOU KNOW, THIS WORLD IS A PERILOUS PLACE. RECENT EVENTS BEG REAL ANSWERS FROM OUR NATION'S LEADERS FOR A CONCERNED PUBLIC. YES, FROM IMMIGRATION TO ROGUE NATIONS TO CONFLAGRATIONS, THIS PAST SUNDAY OUR NATION'S LEADING JOURNALISTIC LIGHTS SAW ANSWERS TO THE DAY'S MOST PRESSING QUESTIONS.
YOU'VE BEEN ON "THE DAILY SHOW." IS JON STEWART FAIR TO REPUBLICANS? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I BELIEVE I CAN FIELD THIS ONE. JON STEWART OF THE "JON STEWART "TIMES-PICAYUNE", IS JON STEWART FAIR TO REPUBLICANS? DOES THE POPE [BLEEPED] IN THE WOODS? [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE IF NOT, NOT ONLY AM I NOT FAIR TO REPUBLICANS, I THINK A BEAR WEARING A HAT GAVE ME COMMUNION. BUT OBVIOUSLY IT IS -- WOW. THAT'S INTERESTING. [LAUGHTER] I'M NOT, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT OTHER JOKE THAT I WAS JUST ABOUT TO MAKE. [LAUGHTER] BUT, IT WAS ABOUT ONE OF US NOT USING THEIR TEETH. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A QUESTION WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR, SENATOR.
NO, BUT HE, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER REALLY. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: SON OF A BITCH. YOU LIED TO ME, BOOK! YOU LIED TO ME. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] LIED TO ME. NEXT THING McCAIN WILL TELL ME IS I DON'T EVEN POOP. [LAUGHTER] WHY, SENATOR, WHY? WHY DON'T I MATTER?
WHEN HE SAYS THINGS, WHICH HE'S ENTITLED TO, AFTER ALL, HE'S A LATE-NIGHT COMIC, THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY WRONG, HE GETS AWAY WITH WITH IT. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: NO, HE'S RIGHT, THOSE LATE-NIGHT COMICS DO GET AWAY WITH MISTAKE AFTER MISTAKE. SOME WITH CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCE. AND YET SOMEHOW THE VIEWERS CONTINUE TO ELECT, TO WATCH. LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS, McCAIN, I'VE BEEN WRONG, I'VE DONE SOME BAD THINGS, PROUNOUNCED SANGUINE "SANG-GUINE", HELPED HUGH GRANT PROMOTE "DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?" BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET, McCAIN, THAT IF WE WENT WRONGO Y WRONGO, YOU'D COME OUT ON BOTTOM. MY 16 YEARS ON THIS SHOW UP AGAINST YOUR 132 YEARS OF SENATE SERVICE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S THAT? OH, REALLY, I'M WRONG. OKAY. POINT McCAIN. [LAUGHTER] SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, SENATOR? CARE TO PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR FORCED SMILE THROUGH JAW-CLENCHING ANGER IS? MY RECORD OF ABSOLUTE WRONGNESS AGAINST YOUR RECORD OF ABSOLUTE WRONGNESS FOR A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED WRONG OFF. [COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] COME ON! I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU COME ON THE PROGRAM LOADED DOWN WITH YOUR JON STEWART WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG FILE, AND I'LL SEE IF I CAN PERHAPS DIG UP ONE OR TWO THINGS YOU'VE BEEN MISTAKEN ABOUT. [TRUCK BACKING UP BEEPING] NO, NO DON'T UNLOAD THE TRUCK YET, BOYS, WAIT TIL HE GETS HERE. SO HOW ABOUT IT, McCAIN, YOU AND ME, WRONG TO WRONG, NO-HOLDS-BARRED, AND THE LOSER HAS TO SIT THROUGH 24 STRAIGHT HOURS WATCHING THE PERSON HE'S BEST KNOWN FOR UNLEASHING ON THE WORLD. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I'M ALMOST WISHING I WOULD LOSE. TURNING FROM AN ANGRY OLD MAN WHOSE ABSOLUTE WRONGNESS HAS WROUGHT GREAT DAMAGE ON THIS WORLD TO AN ANGRY OLD MAN WHOSE BRILLIANT ACUMEN HAS WROUGHT GREAT DAMAGE ON THIS WORLD.
THE BILLIONAIRE WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.
Jon: RUPERT MURDOCH IS IN THE NEWS. WHAT DID HE DO NOW? PUBLISH ROYAL UPSKIRTS? PHONE HACK ORPHANS? EAT A DINGO WHO HAD JUST RECENTLY EATEN A BABY?
RUPERT MURDOCH PUT TIME WARNER ON HIS WISH LIST. THE MEDIA MOGUL OFFERED $80 BILLION FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS GIANT.
HOW MUCH MORE MEDIA CAN ONE DUDE ACTUALLY OWN? THE GUY OWNS OVER 120 NEWSPAPERS AND MEDIA OUTLETS. IF HE BUYS TIME WARNER, NEWS WILL JUST BE [BLEEP] RUPERT MURDOCH THINKS. EVEN CNN, SUBSIDIARY OF TIME WARNER IS IMPRESSED BY THE AUDACIOUSNESS OF THIS PLAY, ALBEIT SLIGHTLY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVELY.
WHY IS HE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW?
HE IS OLD, BUT HE'S SHARP AS A TACK, HIS PHYSICAL APPEARANCE DOES NOT MATCH HIS MENTAL ACUITY. HE'S WORTH $13.9 BILLION. HE'S 83 YEARS OLD.
Jon: I MEAN, HE'S A GREAT BUSINESSMAN, BUT HE FARTS DUST. I MEAN, HE'S GOT FACE LIKE A ROTTING PUMPKIN, BUT HE'S CHARMING. I MEAN, [LAUGHTER] THE GUY'S LIKE "SPONGEBATH NEWSPANTS." WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THE TAKEOVER TO GO THROUGH?
TIME WARNER SAID NO TO RUPERT MURDOCH'S $80 BILLION PROPOSAL.
Jon: OH, SNAP. OF COURSE, THIS BEING TIME WARNER, I BET THEY TOLD HIM TO WAIT AT HOME FOR THEIR ANSWER BETWEEN NOON AND 6:00 P.M. SO I GUESS IT'S ALL OVER.
RUPERT MURDOCH IS NOT GOING TO GIVE UP.
ONCE HE WANTS SOMETHING, HE DOES HIS DAMNEDEST TO REALLY TRY AND GET IT.
REMEMBER, HE BID FOR DOW JONES, THE OWNER OF THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL." AND HE BID AND THEY SAID NO...
GOT TURNDED DOWN.
AND HE CAME BACK AND HE CAME BACK AND HE GOT IT.
Jon: HE'S LIKE THE DATE RAPIST OF MEDIA BARONS, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. AND WHAT OF FAIR CNN?
FOX WOULD HAVE TO SELL CNN FROM TIME WARNER'S ROSTER BECAUSE IT COMPETES WITH THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
CNN WOULD BE DIVESTED, SOLD TO SOME OTHER COMPANY, SOME OTHER BIDDER.
Jon: YES. [LAUGHTER] NOW, OF COURSE, IT WOULDN'T COME CHEAP, THOUGH, WITH ANALYSTS SAYING THE NETWORK WOULD BE WORTH ABOUT $10 BILLION ON THE OPEN MARKET. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR ANYONE, BUT NOT A LOT OF MONEY FOR EVERYONE, WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT WE'RE STARTING OUR KICK STARTER CAMPAIGN TO BUY CNN. YOU CAN BUY IT AT LET'SBUYCNN.COM. YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN, YOU MAKE A PLEDGE FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH $5, $10. JUST KEEP IN MIND, WE NEED $10 BILLION. WE'VE GOT SOME VERY ATTRACTIVE REWARDS AT EVERY LEVEL. FOR INSTANCE, $10,000 LANDS YOU IN A SIGNATURE CNN MASS SHOOTING COVERAGE 6 BOX. FOR $25,000, YOU GET TO TAKE MOLLY WITH FAREED ZAKARIA. FOR $5 MILLION, CNN WILL AIR A 24-HOUR, TWO-WEEK HUNT FOR YOUR LOST CAR KEYS. INCLUDING MARTIN SAVIDGE IN A FULL YOUR COUCH SIMULATOR. BUT KEEP IN MIND, WE NEED $10 BILLION. NOW, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING, SUPPOSE YOU ACTUALLY RAISE ENOUGH MONEY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WITH CNN? WELL, FOR STARTERS, WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO ITS ROOTS, START SHOWING MUSIC VIDEOS AGAIN LIKE IN THE '80s. THAT'S -- OKAY. I'M BEING TOLD THAT WAS MTV. [LAUGHTER] ANOTHER POINT FOR McCAIN. ANYWAY, HOPEFULLY THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN MY WOLF BLITZER KICKSTOPPER. AS FAR AS I KNOW HE HAS NOT YET BEEN STOPPED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
