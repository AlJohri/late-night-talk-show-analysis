[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, AMERICA IS LIKE A  BOY BAND, YES. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT IS THE PREMISES WE ARE  ASSERTING. EACH OF OUR 50 STATE HAS A  DISTINCT PERSONALITY. WE'VE GOT THE CUTE ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT THE REBEL, RIDES A  HARLEY WITH NO HELMET. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'VE GOT THE ONE THAT PRETTY  SURE HAS A DRUG PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE THING ABOUT THE STATES  REPUTATIONS IS THEY ARE HARD TO  CHANGE. MAKES YOU FEEL BAD FOR SOME  PLACE LIKE MISSISSIPPI. EVERY TIME IT OPENS ITS MOUTH  BECAUSE OF ITS REPUTATION YOU  ARE LIKE PLEASE DON'T SAY THE N WORD, PLEASE DON'T SAY THE N  WORD. WHY HAVE THEY HAD SUCH A BAD  REMEMBER. WE'LL LOOK BACK AT A CLASSIC  EPISODE OF "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH  TONIGHT'S SEGMENT 19th CENTURY  NEWS. ♪ ♪  HELLO. GREETINGS AND SALUTATIONS. MY NAME IS JON STEWART AND GIVEN  THE TIMES I'M OBVIOUSLY NEITHER  JEWISH NOR ON TELEVISION. [LAUGHTER] OUR TOP STORY THIS DAY IN THE  1865 IS THAT THE STATE OF  GEORGIA HAS VOTED TO RATIFIED -- WE HAD OVER THE SHOULDERS IN  1965 IN? THE -- 1865? THE STATE OF GEORGIA HAS VOTED  TO RATIFY THE 13th AMENDMENT. DELIGHTFUL. BEING THE 27th STATE TO SO  VOTE THE AMENDMENT IS NATIONAL  ADOPTED AND SLAVERY IS ABOLISHED IN THESE UNITED STATES. OH, BULLY. OF COURSE, THERE STILL REMAIN A  FEW STRAGGLERS WHO HAVE YET TO  RAT FIGHT THE AMENDMENT, -- RATIFY THE AMENDMENT I'M LOOKING  AT MAGNOLIA STATE. HOW MUCH LONGER WILL YOU WAIT? 148 YEARS WOULD BE RIDICULOUS,  WOULDN'T IT?
AFTER 148 YEARS THE STATE OF  MISSISSIPPI HAS FINALLY RATIFIED  THE 13th AMENDMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: AND THAT'S WHY -- [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS UNPLEASANT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHY MISSISSIPPI CAN'T  SHAKE ITS REP FOR BAD RACE  RELATIONS. TWO THINGS, FIRST BETTER LATE  THAN NEVER, AND SECOND, THIS IS  PRETTY (bleep) LATE. [ LAUGHTER ] WHY THE SUDDEN RATIFICATION?
IT'S ALL THANKS TO STEVEN  SPIELBERG'S FILM "LINCOLN."
TWO MEN DISCOVERED  MISSISSIPPI WAS THE LAST STATE  THAT HAS NOT RATIFIED IT.
Jon: AND THEN THEY WENT TO  SEE DJANGO UNCHAINED AND TRIED  TO TAKE THE RATIFICATION BACK. LINKER OR NO LINCOLN HOW ARE YOU  GETTING TO THIS NOW? DIDN'T THE RELEASE OF  MISSISSIPPI BURNING PUSH TO  REVISIT THE ISSUE? TO BE FAIR THEY HAD TAKEN STEPS  TOWARDS BANNING THE  CONTROVERSIAL PRACTICE OF PEOPLE OWNING OTHER PEOPLE.
THE LEGISLATURE DID SIGN ON  IN 1995 BUT CANNOT FILE THE  PROPER PAPERWORK.
Jon: OH, RED TAPE! THEY TRIED TO RATIFY THE 13th  AMENDMENT ALL THE WAY BACK IN  1995. [ LAUGHTER ] INSPIRED NO DOUBT BY THAT YEAR'S  BLOCKBUSTER I KNOW WHAT DID YOU  130 SUMMERS AGO. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN THERE WAS THE 18-YEAR  PAPERWORK MALFUNCTION. WHAT DID HAPPEN WITH THE  PAPERWORK.
THEIR FORMER SECRETARY OF  DICK MULFIS FAILED TO SEND A  COPY OF RESOLUTION TO THE FEDERAL REGISTRAR.
Jon: CLASSIC DICK MULFIS. I'M SURE HE MEANT TO FILE IT  PROPERLY. HERE IS MY IMPRESSION OF HIM  MAILING IT TO THE FEDERAL  REGISTRAR. OH, I'M SO GLAD WE DID THIS. THAT'S REALLY NICE. LET ME PUT THIS IN THE MAILBOX. [LAUGHTER] I IMAGINE THAT WILL GET THERE  TOUT SUITE. WHO CLEANED UP THE MESS?
THE CURRENT MISSISSIPPI  SECRETARY OF STATE DILB RERKS  RERKSDILBERT HOSEMAN.
Jon: HE CLEANED UP FOR  DICK, HUH? I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT
