FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MY GUEST TONIGHT, GEORGE TAKEI IS GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OH, WHAT A DAY IN NEW YORK CITY. NOW I KNOW THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH TESTICLES MELT. [LAUGHTER] IT IS NOT PLEASANT OUT, BUT KUDOS TO THE AUDIENCE FOR EVEN SHOWING UP HERE TONIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] ALTHOUGH, SAVE YOUR ENERGY CAUSE YOU CAN'T STAY IN HERE ALL NIGHT. [LAUGHTER] WE HAVE AIR CONDITIONING. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OBAMACARE, WHICH... [LAUGHTER] AFTER A NUMBER OF SETBACKS, APPEARS TO BE OPERATING AS IT WAS INTENDED. IT'S SMOOTH SAILING FOR OBAMACARE.
BREAKING NEWS, THIS TIME IT CONCERNS OBAMACARE, AND A DRAMATIC BLOW BY FEDERAL APPEALS COURT.
THIS IS A BIG BLOW TO OBAMACARE.
A HUGE BLOW.
HUGE BLOW TO THE ADMINISTRATION.
BAD BLOW.
A MAJOR BLOW.
TOUGH BLOW.
SERIOUS BLOW.
A DEVASTATING BLOW.
AN ENORMOUS BLOW.
Jon: A LOT OF BLOWING! [LAUGHTER] THERE IS SO MUCH BLOWING. EVERYBODY IS BLOWING OBAMACARE. [LAUGHTER] WHAT? WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THAT WOULD SO DRAMATICALLY... ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, GET READY TO BE BLOWN. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDED FEDERAL TAX CREDIT SUBSIDIES TO QUALIFIED LOWER-INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO SIGNED UP IN EXCHANGES ESTABLISHED BY THE STATES. BUT AS YOU KNOW, 36 STATES -- THE REDDER ONES -- OPTED TO NOT SET UP THOSE EXCHANGES, FORCING THEIR RESIDENTS ONTO FEDERAL EXCHANGES, WHICH CAUSED A LAWSUIT AND THUS...
THE LAW DOESN'T EXPRESSLY SAY PEOPLE WHO GET THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH FEDERAL EXCHANGES ALSO GET THOSE TAX CREDITS.
Jon: OH, MY GOD, I'M BEING BLOWN. YES, THEY... THEY FINALLY GOT OBAMACARE. SEE, THE LAW SAYS YOU MUST BE ENROLLED IN THROUGH AN EXCHANGE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE. NOW, A NORMAL PERSON MIGHT SAY, DO YOU REALLY THINK THE LAW INTENDED SUBSIDIES ONLY FOR LOWER-INCOME CITIZENS OF STATES THAT WEREN'T BEING DICKS ABOUT THE EXCHANGES? WELL, TWO OF THE THREE JUDGES IN THIS INSTANCE SAID, UH, YEAH. WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT SENTENCE LITERALLY. I'M JUST HAPPY BOTH JUDGES GOT TO WORK THAT MORNING ASSUMING THAT ONCE THEY HIT STOP SIGNS THEIR DAY ENDS. [LAUGHTER] NO, I HAVE TO... UNTIL THE LAW EXPRESSLY PROVIDES A GO SIGN, WE CAN IN NO WAY ASCERTAIN THE INTENT OF THE FRAMERS OF THE SIGN. SURELY THE PEOPLE HONKING BEHIND ME APPRECIATE THE RIGOR OF MY JUDICIAL  ACUMEN. [BLEEPED] YOU TOO! SO, NOW THAT THE TWO JUDGES MORE LITERAL THAN AMELIA BEDELIA HAVE RULED, WHAT NOW?
THIS RULING CREATES MORE PROBLEMS.
IT'S CHAOS, ISN'T IT?
THIS IS A MESS.
THIS IS A BLOODY MESS.
DEFINITELY SCRAMBLED THINGS UP.
CHAOS FOR THE INSURERS.
CHAOS AND CONFUSION.
CHAOS IN OBAMACARE.
ALL HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE.
Jon: [SCREAMING] NOOO! THERE IS NO LAW. EVERYONE FOR THEMSELVES. IT IS THE END OF THE WORLD. YOU BLEW IT UP. OBAMACARE IS MADE OF PEOPLE. [SCREAMING]
BREAKING NEWS NOW, A SECOND FEDERAL APPEALS COURT HAS REACHED A CONFLICTING OPINION, ANOTHER DECISION.
THEY DECIDED THAT THE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES ARE LEGAL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: [LAUGHING] I HOPE YOU HAVE INSURANCE. SO I GUESS AMERICA HASN'T DEVOLVED INTO A STATE OF APOCALYPTIC CHAOS, BUT THE STATE EXCHANGE CLAUSE, OTHER APPEALS COURT, PLEASE, WHAT ABOUT THE STATE EXCHANGE CLAUSE?
WHAT THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT SAYS IS WHEN YOU READ THE STATUTE AS A WHOLE, AND THIS WAS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENT, IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT'S CONGRESS, THAT'S WHAT CONGRESS WANTED.
Jon: RIGHT, BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CONGRESS WANTED. THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT OUR OBAMACARE FOREFATHERS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. I MEAN, THAT WAS WRITTEN BACK IN 20 OT 9. YOU'D NEED SOME SORT OF TIME MACHINE TO FIND OUT WHAT CONGRESS INTENDED OR A TIVO OR A WORKING TELEPHONE OR LEGS TO WALK OVER AND ASK THEM. SO WHAT EXPLAINS HOW TWO DIFFERENT COURTS OFFER TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EXACT SAME CLAUSE ON THE SAME EXACT DAY?
IN THE FIRST RULING TODAY, A THREE-JUDGE PANEL, TWO REPUBLICAN APPOINTED MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL D.C. CIRCUIT COURT, IN THE OTHER FEDERAL DECISION TODAY, THIS ONE FROM THE FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, A THREE-JUDGE PANEL, ALL APOINTED BY DEMOCRATS.
Jon: RIGHT. SO HOW DID THE REPUBLICAN JUDGES NOT UPHOLD OBAMACARE YET THE DEMOCRATIC JUDGES DID? I MEAN, I JUST WONDER WHAT -- OH. [LAUGHTER] OH, I GET IT NOW. THE COURTS ARE JUST AN EXTENSION OF OUR OWN BROKEN -- [CRYING] IT'S LIKE LOOKING AT ONE OF THOSE MAGIC EYE POSTERS. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND THEN FINALLY THE DOLPHIN JUMPS OUT AT YOU, BUT INSTEAD OF A DOLPHIN, IT'S AN EVIL CLOWN THAT SKULL [BLEEPED] OUR FUNCTIONING OUR 200 AND SOME ODD YEAR DEMOCRACY. THE LAW IS ROTTEN.  OUR JUDICIARY IS ROTTEN. IS THERE ANYTHING, I SAY TO THEE, THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY, OUR WAY OF LIFE?
CONGRESS COULD CHANGE THE WORDING OF THE LAW ITSELF.
Jon: GO ON.
THE SECTION OF THE LAW THAT APPLIED TO CREATING A STATE-BASED EXCHANGE IF THEY HAD JUST ADDED ONE MORE SENTENCE, YOU KNOW, OR ONE MORE CITATION TO APPLY TO THOSE THAT ARE EITHER IN PARTNERSHIP OR CREATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM.
Jon: SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN 36 STATES CAN BE SAVED FROM POSSIBLE BANKRUPTCY OR DEBILITATING LACK OF MEDICAL COVERAGE WITH THE ADDITION OF ONE SENTENCE THAT SAYS, "YOU CAN GET SUBSIDIES THROUGH EXCHANGE SET UP BY THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES." YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A FULL SENTENCE. JUST ADD "OR HHS" ON THE END... JUST TWO WORDS. YOU COULD SALVAGE THIS ENTIRE [BLEEPED] THING WITH A MEDIOCRE SCRABBLE HAND. WELL, LET'S DO IT! THAT'S...COME ON! WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT... I TELL YOU THIS, AS I STAND HERE TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT, EVERYBODY.
THE HOUSE SPEAKER SAID TODAY'S RULING IS ALSO FURTHER PROOF THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HEALTH CARE LAW IS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE. IT CANNOT BE FIXED.
Jon: WELL, I GUESS IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, OLD FRIEND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
