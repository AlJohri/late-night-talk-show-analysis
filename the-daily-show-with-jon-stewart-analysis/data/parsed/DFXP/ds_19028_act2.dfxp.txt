[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, THANKSGIVING IS A TIME, A BLESSED TIME OF YEAR AND WE ALL GIVE THANKS FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR HEALTH AND PREPARE TO BEAT THE (bleep) OUT OF PEOPLE TO GO SHOPPING. [ LAUGHTER ] JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS MORE.
BLACK FRIDAY IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE ON TELEVISION HAS TIPS FOR SHOPPERS.
DEALS ARE IN THE BACK.
PRIORITIZED BY PRICE.
DON'T BUY TOYS.
DON'T TURN RIGHT.
AND DON'T BE BLACK.
TWO BLACK SHOPPERS IN ONE WEEK ARE ACCUSING THE DEPARTMENT STORE OF WRONGFUL DETAINMENT.
HE WAS RACIALLY PROFILED.
SHE USED HER TAX REBATE MONEY TO BUY THIS BAG AT BARNEYS AND STOPPED BY THE COPS.
IT IS HARD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE BLACK FRIDAY STEALS WHEN YOU ARE BEING ACCUSED OF STEALING.
WHEN I LEFT THE STORE THREE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE STORE FOUR UNDERCOVER COPS TOLD ME THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT I PURCHASED.
WHAT DID YOUR WHITE FRIEND SAY?
MY WHITE FRIEND?
EVERYONE KNOWS BRING A WHITE FRIEND WHEN YOU SHOP AT A PLACE LIKE THANK I SHOULD HAVE. NEXT TIME I KNOW.
SO THE PROBLEM ISN'T RACIALLY PROFILING IN STORES IT'S THAT BLACK PEOPLE HAD FORGOTTEN HOW TO SHOP.
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD HELP ME AND THEY DIDN'T. THEY ASKED ME TO LEAVE.
JUST BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE A GAP MODEL, DOESN'T MEAN YOU WON'T BE PROFILED.
I WENT TO A STORE AND I ASKED TO SEE JEANS AND SHE SAID THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE.
YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE YOU WERE WELL PUT TOGETHER YOU COULD SHOP WELANYWHERE YOU WANT WITHOUTSHOP GETTING RACIALLY PROFILED. YOU DO KNOW YOU ARE BLACK, RIGHT?
I KNOW.
WATCH OUT COPS. COPS.
CLEARLY IT'S TIME TO GIVE BLACK AMERICANS MY OWN BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPING TIPS. START SIMPLE, WHEN ENTERING A STORE ALERT EVERYONE TO YOUR PRESENCE. HEY, EVERYBODY, MY NAME IS JESSICA WILLIAMS I INTEND TO BUY A PACK OF GUM. I AM REACHING INTO MY POCKET TO PULL OUT MONEY, NOT A GUN. PERMISSION TO APPROACH. MAKE FRIENDS WITH SECURITY. I BAKED COOKIES, CAN I SHOP NOW? IF THAT DOESN'T WORK ASK A WHITE PERSON TO SHOP FOR YOU. CAN YOU BUY ME THAT WATCH. YOU CAN USE MY CREDIT CARD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIGN MY NAME.
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING THAT.
CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR? YOU LOOK WHITE. IF I GIVE YOU $140 CAN YOU BUY ME THE SUNGLASSES IN THE WINDOW RIGHT THERE?
YEAH, SURE.
THANK YOU. FINALLY FOR A MORE TANGIBLE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE HIRE A MIDDLE AGED WHITE LADY AS A PERSONAL SHOPPER AND EQUIP HER WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA INSIDE THE NECK BRACE. WE'RE IN. GO LEFT. LET'S TRY ON SOME HATS.
LOOK AT THIS.
PUT THAT BACK I'M NOT FEELING IT. LET'S MOVE ON PEGGY. LOOK, YOU  FOUND MY CAT.
JESS THIS, IS PERFECT.
THAT'S MY STYLE BECAUSE MY STYLE IS NOT UGLY.
GOOD CALL I'M DIGGING THOSE KNEE HIGHS.
THESE WOULD LOOK GOOD IN DA CLUB.
DID YOU JUST SAY DA CLUB.
MY FRIEND HAS MORE OF A DARKER COMPLEXION.
LIKE A DEEP TAN.
I'M (bleep) BLACK PEGGY, YOU CAN SAY BLACK. THAT WAS A BUST BUT WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS THERE'S ONE OTHER WAY TO AVOID GETTING RACIALLY PROFILED. COVER YOUR SKIN.
Jon: JESSICA WILLIAMS.
