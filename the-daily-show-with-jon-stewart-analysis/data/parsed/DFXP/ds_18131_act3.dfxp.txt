John: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTRESS WHO  STARRED IN THE UPCOMING FILM  DIVERGENCE. HER NEW MOVIE IS CALLED THE  SPECTACULAR NOW.
DOESN'T YOUR BOYFRIEND PISS  YOU OFF?
I DON'T HAVE AN EX-BOYFRIEND. YOU DON'T HAVE A SINGLE... YOU'RE 17 YEARS OLD AND DON'T  HAVE AN EX-BOYFRIEND.
NO. GUYS DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
I JUST SAW TWO GUYS LOOK AT  YOU LIKE THAT. ERIC WOLF AND CODY, 100% HITTING  ON YOU.
THEY WERE NOT HITTING ON ME. NO, NO, THERE'S NO WAY.
WHY DON'T YOU THINK THEY WERE  HITTING ON YOU?
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T. AMY, YOU'RE SLITLY BEAUTIFUL. OH, MID GOD, NO. Reporter: PLEASE WELCOME THE  WONDERFUL SHAILENE WOODLEY.
ARE WE STANDING? WHAT'S HAPPENING?
John: SHEALY. ... YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GOOD I  WAS WITH GIRLS AS A TEENAGER. THIS IS A COMING OF AGE STORY  ABOUT TEENAGERS COMING OF AGE. YET THERE WERE NO VAMPIRES,  WIZARDS OR SEX. WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE.
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S THE  MOST AUTHENTIC TAKE ON A COMING  OF AGE FILM THAT I'VE SEEN IN 20 YEARS BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ALIVE  MUCH LONGER THAN 20 YEARS. THAT STATEMENT IS INCORRECT
John: IT IS ACCURATE IN THAT  COMING OF AGE IS AWFUL.
WELL, ON TELEVISION IT IS  AWFUL. THERE ARE NO ACCURATE PORTRAYALS  OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN  ADOLESCENT. THIS ONE I THINK WE HOPEFULLY  DID JUSTICE
John: AS A BRITISH PERSON  WATCHING AMERICAN TV PROGRAMS.   ..
TALKING ABOUT THIS  John: ... COMING OF AGE SEEMS  LIKE A VERY TRENDY FORM OF  FASCISM. AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS SEEM JUST  AWFUL.
YES. YOU KNOW, I WENT TO AN AMERICAN  HIGH SCHOOL, A PUBLIC AMERICAN  HIGH SCHOOL. AND I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN  AWFUL IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY LITTLE  CHOIR BUDDIES. I GOT VERY LUCKY. THERE WERE SOME COOL CHOIR  BUDDIES
John: YOU SING YOUR WAY  THROUGH IT.
I SANG MY WAY THROUGH LIFE  John: GLEE IS ACCURATE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?
I THINK GLEE IS A SLIGHTLY  EXAGGERATED VERSION OF SOMETHING  THAT COULD MAYBE EXIST IN AN ARTIST'S MIND
John: YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM  AS WELL. WHICH STAR WARS CHARACTER GAVE  YOU THE CREEPIEST HUG?
I GOT GYPPED. FIRST OFF, I AM A STAR WARS  FANATIC. AS A KINDERGARTENER I THOUGHT I  WAS PRINCESS LEIA STRAIGHT UP. WHEN R2D2 CAME OUT OF THE  ELEVATOR I GOT RIDICULOUSLY  SOAKED. R2D2 IS IN THAT ELEVATOR. I WAS LIKE WHERE? WHERE? IT WAS R2D2 JUST CHILLING
John: THAT'S KIND OF R2D2'S  THING.
HE JUST SORT OF CHILLS  John: HE JUST ROLLS AROUND  NIGHT AND CHILLED.
SMOOTH  John: AND SO ENTHUSIASTIC. YET IT BLURS THE LINE BETWEEN  ENTHUSIASM AND INTIMIDATION.
OH, YEAH. I MEAN, I THINK WAS DEFINITELY  INTIMIDATED. IT WAS SLIGHTLY INTIMIDATING. I WAS ONLY THERE FOR A DAY SO I  THOUGHT A LOT OF INTERIOR HOTEL  ROOMS DOING INTERVIEWS AND SUCH. FROM WHERE WE WERE WE COULD SEE  A RIVER OF HUMANS. IT WAS DOMESTICS AT ITS GREATEST
John: THAT IS A PERFECT NOUN. A ROLLING RIVER OF  DOMESTICATION. ECCENTRIC ENTHUSIASTIC HUMANITY  THAT YOU WANT NOT GET TOO WET  IN.
EXACTLY. MAYBE LIKE DIP YOUR TOES IN IT. SLIGHTLY WET.
John: VERY WEIRD POINT OF  YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO THIS MOVIE  DIVERGENCE.
WE JUST FINISHED THIS MOVIE  John: THAT'S RUMORED TO BE  THE NEXT HUNGER GAMES.
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY  John: WHICH IS GOING TO PUT  YOU IN AN ODD POSITION.
WHY? John: YOU'RE A COMFORTABLE  LEVEL OF BEING IN MOVIES NOW. AND HUNGER GAMES LEVEL SEEM LIKE  YOU THEN HAVE TO PROCESS HOW DO  I NOT GO MAD OR BECOME AN [BLEEP]?
YEAH, LUCKY FOR ME I HAVE  ENOUGH FRIENDS WHO WOULD MAKE ME  BLACK AND BLUE BEFORE I BECAME AN [BLEEP]
John: THAT IS KEY. YOU NEED FRIENDS.
YOU NEED BAD-ASS FRIENDS. John: WHO HAVE THAT TRIGGER  IN THEM. YOU ARE A [BLEEP] AND WE ARE  TAKING YOU DOWN.
AND THEY HAVE FULL PERMISSION  TO. ANYONE HAS FULL PERMISSION TO. IF I BECOME AN [BLEEP], THEY CAN
John: THAT'S A GREAT THING  FOR YOU TO SAY ON TAPE. LIKE ANTHONY WEINER, YOU WILL BE  HELD TO IT SAYING YOU HAVE FULL  PERMISSION, IF SHAILENE WOODLEY BECOMES AN [BLEEP].
I TOTALLY AGREE  John: THE MOVIE IS GREAT. IT'S NOT WHAT IT SEEMS. COMING OF AGE. IT'S DARK. IT'S FUN EVE. IT'S COMPLICATED. IT'S WEIRD. IT'S EVERYTHING ABOUT BEING A  TEENAGER THAT I WANTED TO GET  OUT OF AS QUICKLY AS I COULD WHEN I WAS THERE.
SLIGHTLY AWKWARD, ISN'T IT? John: SLIGHTLY AWKWARD IS  PUTTING IT MILDLY. TRY BEING BRITISH IN BRITAIN. IT'S...
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN BEING AN  AMERICAN IN AMERICA.
John: IT IS DIFFERENT BY  ABOUT 3,000 MILES. SPECTACULAR WILL OPEN IN CITIES  ON AUGUST 7 AND WILL GO  NATIONWIDE ON AUGUST 3. THE WONDERFUL SHAILENE WOODLEY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
