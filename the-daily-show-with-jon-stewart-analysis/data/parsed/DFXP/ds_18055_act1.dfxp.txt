FEBRUARY 4, 2013. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. FORMER CHANCELLOR OF WASHINGTON  D.C. PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM  MICHELLE RHEE IS GOING TO BE JOINING US HERE. STAY IN SCHOOL. DON'T DROP OUT AND GET HIGH AND  COME TO A TAPING OF THE SHOW. AND ASK THE HOST, WHAT'S IS YOUR  SCRIPT, MAN? WHAT'S ON THERE? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   IS IT THE LETTER G? WE HAVE FUN HERE. LISTEN. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST  NIGHT. A SPORTING EVENT KNOW  ENCAPSULATES THE ENTIRE TEE OF  WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. AN EVENT KNOW BEGINS WITH AN  EMOTIONAL SALUTE TO THE VICTIMS  OF GUN VIOLENCE QUICKLY GIVES WAY WITH A PROMOTIONAL SALUTE TO  THE GLORIFYING OF SAID GUN  VIOLENCE.
BANG-BANG TIME. Jon: YES, IT IS. BANG-BANG TIME. DIDN'T REALIZE IT HAD TAKEN SUCH  A DARK TURN. WE CHEERED AS MEN COMMITTED  BRUTAL VIOLENCE ONE ANOTHER AND  THEN COMPLAINED BITTERLY AT THE SIGHT OF TWO PEOPLE KISSING. AND A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR SOUND  AND LIGHT SHOW WAS IMMEDIATELY  FOLLOWED BY YET ANOTHER SIGN THAT OUR BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS  ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE. COULDN'T FIND A FOOTBALL MOVIE  WHERE THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. LAST NIGHT WAS A BIG BOWL OF  SUPER. ANYBODY OUT THERE WITH RED BLOOD  COURSING THROUGH THEIR VEINS  WATCHED THE RAVENS SQUEEZE BY THE SAN FRANCISCO 49'ers  ALL WHILE EATING FOOD DESIGNED  TO STOP RED BLOOD FROM COURSING THROUGH THEIR VEINS. DON'T MIND IF I DO. ANYBODY CAN PRETEND TO BE A REAL  AMERICAN AND WATCH IT. I TAKE IT UP A NOTCH. I SKEET SHOOT WHILE I WATCH. SKEET SHOOT ALL THE TIME, MAN. WHEN I'M WATCHING TV, I SKEET  SHOOT. INSIDE. OUTSIDE. THAT'S NOT PHOTO SHOPPED. THERE'S NO WAY TO PHOTO SHOP A  SKEET SHOOT PICTURE. AS WITH ANY GREAT AMERICAN  CONFLICT, THIS GAME PIT BROTHER  AGAINST BROTHER. EACH WONDERING WHO WOULD FINALLY  WIN THE GAME AND WITH IT THE  LONG LOST LOVE OF THEIR PARENTS. BY HALF TIME WITH THE SCORE 21-6  IT APPEARED THE GAME WAS ALL BUT  OVER. THAT'S WHEN SHE WALKED IN. AMAZING VOCALS, BREATH TAKING  CHOREOGRAPHY AND OF COURSE  WHATEVER THIS WAS. SHE EVEN LET TWO LUCKY CONTEST  WINNERS JOIN HER ON STAGE. YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT ONE, HUH? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   ACTUALLY IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE  DESTINY'S CHILD BACK TOGETHER AGAIN OR AS GEORGE  STEPHANAPOLOUS CALLS THEM THE  POINTER SISTERS
THAT'S MORGAN FREEMAN, I  THINK.
Jon: NEVER GETS OLD. YOU KNOW, AFTER BEYONCE'S  PERFORMANCE, IF YOU LIKED IT,  YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT A FUSE ON  IT. JUST AS BALTIMORE'S JACOBY JONES  SEEMINGLY PUT THE GAME OUT OF  REACH...
THIS IS ABOUT A PIECE OF  ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT THAT  MONITORS THE FEEDING INTO THE  STADIUM. OFFICIALS ARE CALLING IT, QUOTE,  AN ABNORMALITY
Jon: OH, RIGHT. AN ABNORMALITY. (YELLING)  WHY DID YOU (MUMBLING)? HOW MANY FOOTBALL PLAYERS SAW  THAT? THE WINS AND LOSSES BLACK OUT  THE PERFORMANCE ASIDE, THE REAL  CONTEST TOOK PLACE AMONGST AMERICA'S FOREMOST PRODUCTS WHO  COMPETED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO  BE BUZZED ABOUT. WITH AN ESTIMATED GLOBAL  AUDIENCE OF EVERYBODY. THE SUPER BOWL IS THE COMPANY'S  BEST CHANCE TO GET ITS MESSAGE  ACROSS TO AMERICA. MESSAGES LIKE OUR CANDY FEELS  PAIN WHEN YOU EAT IT. AND OUR CHIPS ARE SO GOOD, EVEN  A GOAT WILL EAT THEM. INTERESTINGLY THOUGH, THAT AD  WASN'T THE ONE THAT WOUND UP  BEING THE MOST TALKED ABOUT.
IT MIGHT BE THE MOST  CONTROVERSIAL AD OF THE SUPER  BOWL, THIS AD FROM GODADDY CALLED PERFECT MATCH WHERE SUPER  MODEL BAR RAFAELI LOCKS LIPS  WITH A GEEKY-LOOKING ENGINEER
Jon: BECAUSE SHE WAS KISSING  A JEW? IS THAT WHY? OH, IT'S SO DISGUSTING TO KISS A  JEW. IS THAT IT? WHAT'S THAT? I'M BEING TOLD THAT THAT'S NOT  WHY PEOPLE WERE UPSET. THE SOURCE WAS APPARENTLY  AMERICA'S BELIEF THAT AFFECTION  SHOULD ONLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN  LOOKS-EQUALS. HE'S NOT A... (SCREAMING). BY THE WAY HOW WAS THIS  OBJECTIONABLE? BUT EVERYBODY WAS PERFECTLY FINE  ABOUT THE AD WHERE THE GUY WAS  CLEARLY [BLEEP] HIS HORSE.   ( APPLAUSE )   I'M NOT SAYING I BLAME HIM. IT WAS A FINE LACKING HORSE. IN THE END THE RAVENS PREVAILED. THE GAME WAS A SWAN SONG FOR  17-YEAR VETERAN LINEBACKER RAY  LOOM IT. RAY LEWIS, I'M SORRY. SEEN HER PORTRAYED AS A VERY  ANGRY BADGER. THE INSPIRATIONAL FIGURE TO HIS  TEAMMATES LEWIS' STORY IS  COMPLICATED BY SOME PERSONAL  TROUBLES. A LITTLE MATTER OF... I'LL LET  BOOMER EXPLAIN
HE WAS INVOLVED IN A DOUBLE  MURDER
Jon: INVOLVED IN A DOUBLE  MURDER. A LITTLE DOUBLE MURDER. AS KNUTE ROCKNE USED TO CALL  THEM, THE OLD DOUBLE MURDER-OO. IN THE PREGAME INTERVIEW, RAY  LEWIS OFFERED UP A NOVEL DEFENSE  FOR HIS ACTIONS
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO  THE FAMILIES
TO THE FAMILY, IF YOU KNEW,  IF YOU REALLY KNEW THE WAY GOD  WORKS, HE DON'T USE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT ANYTHING LIKE THAT. FOR HIS GLORY. NO WAY. IT'S THE TOTAL OPPOSITE.
Jon: WOW. MUST BE QUITE THE COMFORT TO  FAMILIES OF THOSE MURDER  VICTIMS. THE NEWS THAT GOD MAKES SURE  EVERYBODY GETS WHAT THEY  DESERVE. STILL THAT'S THE CASE. THEN CRIMINAL TRIALS WOULD GO A  LOT FASTER. YOUR HONOR, WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU  BELIEVE IN THE VICTIM'S BLOOD  FOUND IN MY CLIENT'S LIMOUSINE? WOULD GOD ALLOW A MURDERER TO GO  TO 13? I REST MY FAITH. BY THE END OF THIS LONG AND  COMPLICATED DAY OUR SENSES HAD  BEEN BEATEN INTO SUBMISSION AND NUMBED BY EXCESS. JUST AS I BEGAN TO QUESTION THIS  ANNUAL RITUAL OF VIOLENCE AND  CONSUMERISM, I SAW THIS ONE FINAL COMMERCIAL.
IN THE ETERNAL DEBATE FOR  ANSWERS, THE ONE THING THAT IS  TRUE IS WHAT'S TRUE FOR YOU.
Jon: AND I REALIZED AFTER  SEEING THAT THAT I ACTUALLY [BLEEP] THE SUPER BOWL. GUYS GETTING HIT REALLY HARD. BEER TRUCKS, CHIPS. I FOUND MY ANSWER SIGHEN TO GO  AND IT WAS INSIDE MY  REFRIGERATOR THE WHOLE TIME. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
