FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY! WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A VERY NICE SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST TONIGHT, AUBREY PLAZA FROM THE MOVIE "LIFE AFTER BETH," BUT FIRST, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU, FOLKS, WHERE TO BEGIN TONIGHT. THE MIDDLE EAST, YOU DON'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT IT THESE DAYS. [LAUGHTER] BUT RIGHT BEFORE WE STARTED THE TAPING, ISRAEL AND HAMAS HAVE APPARENTLY AGREED TO A 72-HOUR CEASEFIRE, A 72-HOUR CEASEFIRE. IT'S VERY NICE. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] IT'S THREE DAYS. LET ME TELL YOU, HERE'S WHAT I'M HOPING FOR, A THREE-DAY CEASEFIRE SOMEHOW MIRACULOUSLY TURNS INTO AN EIGHT-DAY CEASEFIRE AND SUDDENLY WE GOT OURSELVES ANOTHER HANUKKAH WORKING, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? A WHOLE OTHER MIRACLE. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOMETHING A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN HOPING FOR.
WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO END THE VIOLENCE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT HIS PRESIDENCY BEHIND THE EFFORTS TO TRY FIND PEACE IN THE REGION.
Jon: AND NOW WE GOT THREE DAYS OF IT. [LAUGHTER] A LONG WEEKEND OF PEACE. IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO REALLY KNOW WHAT BROUGHT THIS ABOUT, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE BREAK CAME AFTER THIS:
ISRAEL HAS MADE A REQUEST FOR RESUPPLY OF SEVERAL TYPES OF AMMUNITION. AS ONE DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAID TO ME, THEY HAVE BEEN USING UP AN AWFUL LOT.
Jon: THAT IS, OF COURSE, THE CORRESPONDENT FROM THE UNDERSTATEMENT TIMES PICAYUNE. SO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THEY'RE JUST RUNNING OUT OF [BLEEPED] TO BLOW UP. MAYBE WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THE DIPLOMATS TACKLED ISRAEL WHILE THEY WERE RELOADING. IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AS WE HEARD EARLIER HAS BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY TOWARDS. NOW IS OUR CHANCE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS AGREED TO RESUPPLY ISRAEL'S MILITARY WITH MULTIPLE TYPES OF AMMUNITION.
120 MILLIMETER MORTARS AND GRENADES, FOUR GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
Jon: WE HAD THIS. WHY ARE WE GIVING THEM MORE WITH THE BLOWING...? LET'S END THE FIGHTING, BUT FIRST, HAVE SOME MORE FIGHTING STUFF. NO! GUYS, WE CANNOT BE ISRAEL'S REHAB SPONSOR AND ITS DRUG DEALER. IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. JUST SAY NO. BUT FIRST, SMOKY SMOKE? BUT, NOW LET'S TURN TO CONGRESS. OBVIOUSLY GREAT NEWS ON THE CEASEFIRE. CONGRESS, THOUGH, HAS A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE THEIR SUMMER RECESS, WHICH IS GOING TO START, OH, NOW. IT IS NOW.
THE BORDER BILL.
A HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL.
EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.
STUDENT LOAN RELIEF.
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO FIX THAT, THEN BY THE TIME WE LEAVE HERE FOR THE AUGUST RECESS, WE WILL HAVE FAILED.
Jon: STOP. STOP IT. DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF. [LAUGHTER] WHEN YOU GUYS SUCK, IT IS NOT FAILURE. IT IS JUST YOU LIVING UP TO OUR EXTREMELY LOW EXPECTATIONS OF YOU. [LAUGHTER] CONGRESS IS THE "SHARKNADO 2"  OF GOVERNMENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, OF COURSE IT SUCKED. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SUCK. [LAUGHTER] BUT I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS LIKE THE HEAR THAT KIND OF URGENCY FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO FIRST THERE? BORDER CRISIS? STUDENT LOANS? HOW ABOUT A NICE LITTLE BUDGET RESOLUTION? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
WE HAVE CHOSEN TO BRING THIS LEGISLATION FORTH TODAY TO SUE THE PRESIDENT OVER HIS SELECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
Jon: OKAY. OKAY. OR YOU COULD TO THAT. THAT COULD... LOOK, CONGRESS, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. YOU HAVE TO PASS THE LAWS ON YOUR PLATE, ALL OF THEM, BEFORE YOU GET DESSERT, WHICH IN THIS CASE IS YOU SUING THE PRESIDENT. LOOK, THAT'S YOUR PRIORITY? SURE, THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANT KIDS ARE SLEEPING UNDER OUR BRIDGES, WHICH, BY THE WAY, ARE COLLAPSING BECAUSE OF THE HIGHWAY STRUCTURES FUNDING BILLS, BUT IF WE GO ON BREAK WITHOUT SUING THE PRESIDENT, WE'LL NEVER REACH CHARLIE RANGEL LEVELS OF RELAXATION ON OUR BREAK. [APPLAUSE] LOOK, WHY ARE YOU SUING THE PRESIDENT?
OUR FOUNDERS, THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT TOO MUCH POWER IN THE HANDS OF ANY ONE PERSON OR ANY ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD INEVITABLY LEAD TO TYRANNY.
Jon: OH, FOR [BLEEPED] SAKE. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE A WHILE. CARRY ON.
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS UNDERSTOOD THE DANGER OF HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLY ENFORCED THE LAWS BUT MADE THEM.
ARE YOU WILLING TO LET ANYONE TEAR APART WHAT OUR FOUNDERS HAVE BUILT?
WE CANNOT STAND BY AND WATCH THE PRESIDENT SHRED OUR CONSTITUTION.
THAT TYPE OF ACTION AMOUNTS TO TYRANNY, MR. SPEAKER, TYRANNY.
Jon: WHAT? HUH? THE BRITISH ARE COMING, THE BRITISH ARE COMING! YES, IT'S TYRANNY. OBAMA'S A TYRANT. WE ALL KNOW THROUGHOUT HISTORY THE ONLY WAY TO DEPOSE A TYRANT IS VIA A CIVIL LAWSUIT. [LAUGHTER] I THINK I REMEMBER CAESAR'S FAMOUS LAST WORDS, "ET SUE, BRUTE?" LOOK, LOOK, MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS ENTIRELY NECESSARY AND EFFECTIVE LAWSUIT WASN'T A MATTER OF PARTNERSHIP BUT OF PRINCIPLE.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS. IF THERE WERE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT DOING THE SAME THING, I WOULD FEEL JUST AS STRONGLY.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S BULL [BLEEP.] [LAUGHTER] IT'S JUST, I MEAN, IT'S JUST, IT JUST IS [BLEEPED]. IT JUST IS [BLEEPED]. LOOK, THIS LADY WAS IN CONGRESS WHEN THEN-PRESIDENT BUSH IN 2006 TOOK EXECUTIVE ACTION TO WAIVE OR EXTEND DEADLINES ON FINANCIAL PENALTIES CLEARLY WRITTEN INTO THE MEDICARE PART D HEALTH CARE LAW. NOW, SINCE THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY IDENTICAL EXECUTIVE ACTION TO THE ONE YOU'RE NOW SUING PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR, LET'S FLASH BACK TO THEN AND CHECK OUT THE REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESSWOMAN FOX'S JUST-AS-STRONG REACTION TO THAT TYRANNY.
HEY! HEY! WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
Jon: TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIR TO THE REPUBLICANS, BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO SUE THE PRESIDENT, THEY TRIED OFFICIAL CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION TO MAKE THEIR VOICE HEARD.
REWRITING OBAMA CARE ISN'T ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS THIS PRESIDENT HAS ABUSED HIS POWER. LAST WEEK I SENT THE PRESIDENT 21 TWEETS, WHICH LAID OUT THE THINGS THAT HE COULD DO TO STOP THIS MESS AT THE BORDER.
Jon: 21 TWEETS! A RALLYING CRY FOR VICTORY. 21 TWEETS, WHY THAT'S ALMOST 3,000 CHARACTERS. OF COURSE, SPLIT OVER THE TIMELINE BETWEEN RETWEETS AND @ REPLIES, HASHTAG GAMES, IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER BILLIONS OF PAGES OF TWEETING COMPLAINTS THAT THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES EVERY [BLEEPED] SECOND OF THE DAY, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO AT LEAST FAVE ONE OF THOSE. [LAUGHTER] ALTHOUGH I GUESS IT IS SHOCKING, CONGRESSMAN, THAT THE MEDIUM CHRIS BROWN USES [BLEEPED] TO TALK DRAKE IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE TOOL. SO HOUSE REPUBLICANS DECIDED TO SPEND THEIR LAST HOURS IN SESSION INDULGING IN EMPTY, TIME-WASTING POLITICAL THEATER. HOUSE DEMOCRATS WERE LEFT ONLY ONE OPTION. IMPOTENT ANGER.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE RELENTLESS PARTNERSHIP THAT HAS LED THE CONGRESS TO HAVING A LOWER APPROVAL RATING THAN HEAD LICE.
Jon: OH, HO, LOWER THAN HEAD LICE. WAIT. DO YOU HEAR THAT? I HEAR A CELEBRATION. CHUCK, CAN WE GET A CLOSE-UP OF THE CELEBRATION?
WE DID IT. WE'RE NOT THE MOST HATED THING.
Jon: GOOD FOR YOU, HEAD LICE. GOOD FOR YOU. AND AS FOR YOU, PUBIC LICE, HANG IN THERE. CONGRESS KEEPS GOING THE WAY IT'S GOING, YOU'LL GET YOUR SHOT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
