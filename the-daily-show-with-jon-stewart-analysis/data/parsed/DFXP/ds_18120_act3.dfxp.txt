WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A LEGENDARY  NEWSMAN WHO IS CURRENTLY A  SPECIAL COHR COHR FOR NBC NEWS, HE'S ALSO THE HOST OF  THE MILITARY CHANNEL THE  BROKAW FILES.
THE COURIER IS RETURNING  HOME AFTER 7 MONTHS AT SEA  HAVING PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE ONGOING SUPPORT OF  OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM  IN AFGHANISTAN. OUR SAILORS ARE SAFELY HOME. IN EVERY DIRECTION SMILES  AND KISSES, HUGS AND TEARS,  THEY'RE ALL RETURNING HOME WITH ONE THING IN COMMON.
THANK YOU SO --
THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO BE  BACK.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO  THE SHOW THE GREAT TOM  BROKAW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. LISTEN, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW  WELL YOU'RE DOING AND HERE'S  HOW I KNOW. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO DOESN'T  WATCH A LOT OF TELEVISION. I SAID I WOULD BE ON THE  DAILY SHOW TOMORROW NIGHT. AND HE SAID OH MY GOD, I  WATCHED THE OTHER NIGHT, JON  STEWART NOT WEARING GLASSES, HE'S MAJOR RECONSTRUCTIONIVE  SURGERY, AND HE SAID HE  LOOKED A LOT BETTER AFTER  THE SURGERY. AND SO I.
I WAS GOING GO A  DIFFERENT WAY. I DON'T KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE  SURGERY CAN MAKE YOURSELF --
NOT AT ALL, JOHN, YOU HAD  THAT ONE COMING. SO MR. BROKAW, SIR.
LET'S NOT START THAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE, THE SHOW, THE  BROKAW FILES, IT'S LIKE "THE X-FILES" EXCEPT IT'S TO THE  ABOUT THE PARANORMAL, IT'S  ABOUT A 40 YEAR DECORATED CAREER IN JOURNALISM.
WELL, IT'S-- THAT'S VERY  NICE TO HEAR. AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  ME TO SEE MY HAIR HISTORY  AMONG OTHER THINGS FROM THE KIND OF PETER PAN LOOK UNTIL  THE AGING GRAYING AARP  MEMBER.
COME ON, STOP IT. IT IS AMAZING, IT'S AN  AMAZING ARCHIVE OF WORK TO  LOOK BACK ON. THE INCREDIBLE MOMENT DURING  THE COMMAND NEVER CHIEF  EPISODE WHERE YOU'RE WITH  PRESIDENT CLINTON DURING THE FIRST 100 DAYS. AND THERE IS A SMALL MOMENT  WHERE GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS  HAS GIVEN A BRIEFING A AN AS A JOURNALIST WHO LOOKS  BRIGHT INTOED CAMERA SAID  THIS BRIEFING IS GOING TO BE  AROUND THE WORLD REASON 48  HOURS. YOU THINK 48 HOURS.
RIGHT.
THAT WAS 48 SECONDS DELAY,  THERE WOULD BE A RIOT IN THE  PRESS CORPS NOW. CLEARLY JOURNALISM HAS GOT  FASTER. HAS IT GOT BETTER BEARING IN  MIND THAT THE ANSWER IS NO. (LAUGHTER)
HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. AND IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. ALL OF YOU CAN NO LONGER  JUST BE COUCH POTATOES, YOU  CAN NO LONGER JUST GO OFF  WITH A PAPER IN THE MORNING AND TUNE INTO ONE OF THE  THREE MAINSTREAM OR AS SARA  PALIN LIKES TO SAY  LAMESTREAM MEDIA.
SHE DOES LIKE TO SAY.
YOU HAVE TO WORK HARDER  AT IT NOW. IF YOU WORK HARDER AT IT,  FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE A FRIEND  WHO IS THE EDITOR OF A PAPER IN YOUR COUNTRY, ONE OF THE  GREAT PAPERS IN THE WORLD,  THE FINANCIAL TIMES. I CAN GO UP ON A KEYSTROKE  NOW IN THE MORNING AND SEE  WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE  EURO ZONE, WITH THE MIDDLE  EAST. SO IF YOU WORK HARDER AT IT  YOU CAN PULL OUT A LOT OF  REMARKABLY RELIABLE AND  HIGHLY CREDIBLE INFORMATION. THE PROBLEM IS EVERYTHING  MOVES AT WARP SPEED NOW AND  THE SCREEN IS SO CLUTTERED WITH CHAT AND PEOPLE WHO  JUST WANT TO MAKE AS MUCH  MISCHIEF OR VICIOUS ATTACKS  AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.
HAS THE SPEED COST US  THOUGHT, HAS IT COST US JUST  BASIC PAUSE FOR THOUGHT. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE, IT'S  JUST A RACE TO BE FIRST NOW.
WHEN I WAS THE WHITE  HOUSE CORRESPONDENT DURING  WATERGATE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WAS THE GREATEST CRISIS IN  THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND  IT WAS A TERRIBLY DEMANDING JOURNALISTIC ASSIGNMENT. SO I SPENT ALL DAY TRYING TO  FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON  BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HOW CONGRESS  AND THE COUNTRY WAS REACTINGMENT  I GO ON NIGHTLY NEWS LAST NIGHT AND AT 7:00 I START  WORKING THE PHONES AGAIN,  FOR THE NEXT MORNING'S  APPEARANCE ON THE "TODAY  SHOW". NOW IF I WERE THERE, THEY  WOULD HIT A SWITCH AND AT  7:00 CHRIS MATTHEW WAS BE  SAYING TO ME DON'T YOU THINK HE'S GUILTY. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WE  OUGHT TO JUST HAING UP FROM  ITS GALLOWS NOW. THERE ISN'T THAT OPPORTUNITY  FOR THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO  BE DONE. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A  LOT OF VERY GOOD WORK THAT  IS BEING DONE. IT JUST DOESN'T GET THE A  FINANCIAL AND CLATTER THAT  PASSES FOR A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING.
NO QUESTION. YOU TAKE THE BOSTON BOMBING  AND JUST THE VISUAL MESS  THAT WAS VOMITED IN FRONT OF PEOPLE ON TELEVISION. IT WAS-- YOU ARE WATCHING  CNN. IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE  LITERALLY TALKING FASTER  THAN THEY WERE THINKING.
YES.
THEY HAD REMOVED THEIR  INTERNAL MONOLOGUE AND WERE  JUST THROWING WORDS AT THE  CAMERA.
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE  BEEN SAYING AND I WAS  TALKING TO A GROUP JUST  TODAY, WE'VE GOT TO GET IN FRONT OF TECHNOLOGY AND NOT  ALWAYS BE BEHIND. AND WE'RE CHASING IT  CONSTANTLY NOW. AS I WATCH THE BOSTON  BOMBING I KEPT SAYING WHERE  IS THE NARRATIVE. WHAT IS IT THAT WE ARE NOT  SEEING THAT WE NEED TO KNOW. THERE-- THE TEMPTATION IS  ALWAYS JUST TO TELL WITH YOU  WHAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO  HAVE THAT DIALOGUE WITHIN  JOURNALISM ITSELF. AND FOR THAT MATTER I THINK  WE HAVE TO HAVE IT IN THE  COUNTRY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH  ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THE  POWER AND THE REACH THAT IT HAS TO USE IT MORE WISELY. I DON'T THINK THAT WE OUGHT  TO SUPPRESS SPEECH BUT I DO  THINK THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW --
NOW SCOTT PELLEY  DELIVERED A VERY BLISTERING  SPEECH WHEN HE WAS PICKING UP THE-- AWARD WHEN HE WAS  TALKING TO THIS, SAYING  JOURNALISM HAS BECOME GOSSIP. DUE TO THINGS LIKE TWITTER  AND READ-IT, WHICH HE DOES  NOT COUNT AS JOURNALISM. I GUESS THEY ARE NOT  JOURNALISM, THAT IS JUST  PEOPLE VIEW THINGS.
THEY ARE TOOLS. AND THERE IS SOMETHING KIND  OF USEFUL AN THERE'S AN  ADAPTATION GOING ON THAT  YOUNGER AUDIENCES AND YOUNGER USERS OF THIS  TECHNOLOGY ARE ABLE TO SORT  OUT BETTER THAN PEOPLE MY  AGE AND SCOTT'S AGE. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO ADAPT  TO IT. IT'S NOW FOR MOST YOUNG  PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE,  IT'S ROUTINE FOR THEM TO GET  SOME INFORMATION FROM TWITTER OR FROM FACEBOOK OR  FROM THE OTHER PLACES. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH  DOES IT HOLD UP. AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS FLYING  BY YOU AND DOESN'T GIVE YOU  THE CONTEXT THAT YOU NEED. GOSSIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN A  CONTROL. YOU COME FROM A COUNTRY  WHERE THE TABS HAVE BEEN BIG  AND ARE LARGER NOW THAN THEY PROBABLY HAVE BEEN.
WE ARE'S THE BIGGEST SCUM  BAGS IN THE WORLD.
BUT I JUST THINK DO YOU  EVER FINE YOURSELF WATCHING  THE NEWS LIKE MICHAEL JORDAN WATCHES BASKETBALL NOW. I JUST THINK TO YOU AT HOME,  I JUST PICTURE YOU AT HOME  LIKE IN TEAR AWAY SWEAT PANTS GOING GET ME IN THE  GAME. THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT. GO YOU HAVE TIME TO STICK  AROUND TO HAVE A DISCUSSION  ON THE WEB S THAT OKAY.
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THE BROKAW FILES AIR  TOMORROW AT 10 P.M. THE WONDERFUL TOM BROKAW,  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. (APPLAUSE)
