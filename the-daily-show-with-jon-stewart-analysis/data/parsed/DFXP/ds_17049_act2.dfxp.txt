Jon: WELCOME BACK. LAST NIGHT THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HELD THEIR 80 MILLIONTH DEBATE. THIS TIME IN TAMPA BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S FLORIDA PRIMARY. IT WAS A NIGHT OF ONE UPSMANSHIP. IT WAS AN ISSUE VITAL TO THE ISSUE OF COUNTRY OF FLORIDA.
LET'S SAY PRESIDENT ROMNEY GETS THAT PHONECALL AND IT IS TO  SAY THAT FIDEL CASTRO HAS DIED.
Jon: WHAT FIDEL CASTRO IS NOT DEAD YET? I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT GUY DIED -- DIDN'T NIXON GET THAT CALL OR CARTER AT THE LATEST?
FIRST OF ALL YOU THANK HEAVENS THAT FIDEL CASTRO HAS BEEN SENT TO HIS MAKER AND SENT  TO ANOTHER LAND.
Jon: TO ANOTHER LAND? ARE THEY SENDING CASTRO TO NARNIA? LAST THING WE NEED IS A COMMUNIST DICTATOR WITH ACCESS TO WITCHES.
I DON'T THINKIFIED DELL IS GOING TO MEET HIS MAKER. I THINK HE'S GOING TO ANOTHER PLACE.
Jon: I GUESS THAT WOULD BE MIDDLE EARTH. [ LAUGHTER ] DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY BETTER. IF CASTRO GETS HIS HANDS ON -- WAY TO ONE UP ROMNEY THOUGH. POINT GINGRICH. WATCH ROMNEY REVEAL A PLAN TO SOLVE THE FOREIGN POLICY CRISIS.
HOW DO YOU END A WAR IN AFGHANISTAN WITHOUT TALKING TO THE TALIBAN?
BY BEATING THEM. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: BY BEATING THEM IN AFGHANISTAN. RIGHT. RIGHT NOW ALEXANDER THE GRAIT GOING OH, BEATING THEM! WHAT WAS I THINKING? WHAT WAS I THINKING WITH THE FREEZING TO DEATH AND THE --  [ LAUGHTER ] ALL I NEEDED TO DO WAS BEAT THE PEOPLE IN AFGHANISTAN. [ LAUGHTER ] THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT LAST NIGHT WAS IT SHOWED US A NEW SIDE TO MITT ROMNEY. GINGRICH GAINED MOMENTUM BY BEING A BOMB THROWER. ROMNEY LIKED IT.
THE SPEAKER WAS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE LEADER OF PARTY IN 1994. HE RESIGNED IN DISGRACE. HIS APPROVAL RATING WAS DONE TO 18%. WE SUFFERED HISTORIC LOSSES AFTER HIS FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE. FREDDIE MAC WAS PAYING $1600,000 AT THE SAME TIME FREDDIE MAC WAS COSTING THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA  MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
Jon: HOT OR NOT.COM RATING THE SPEAKER A RESOUNDING NOT! HERE IS THE THING ROMNEY HAS NO IDEA WHO HE IS DEALING WITH. YOU CAN'T BE A DICK TO GINGRICH. HE IS A MASTER OF DICK-FU. HE WILL USE HIS OPPONENTS DICKNESSNESS AGAINST -- HE STUDIED IN THE MOUNTAINS OF  TIBET WITH THE DICKY-LLAMA. WATCH HIM AT WORK.
THERE'S A POINT IN THE DRAMA WHERE IT GETS POINTLESSLY NASTY AND THAT'S SAD.
Jon: MITT WAS A DICK TO HIM SO ROMNEY HE IS THINKING HE WILL BE  A DICK BACK AND NOW MITT LOOKS LIKE A TOTAL DICK. NOW NEWT PROCEED PROID TO (bleep) ON MITT FROM ABOVE.
HE WENT ON MAKE ALLEGES. I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND THE EVENING CHASE S GOFF NGO ROMNEY'S MISINFORMATION. WE'LL HAVE A SITE ON NEWT.ORG. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE THE TIME ON THE THEM.
Jon:S THAT CONTEMPT. MY TIME IS VALUABLE. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE IT DESCRIBING THE WAYS MITT ROMNEY IS A LIAR. HE HAS LOST THE SUPPORT OF GRANDCHILDREN AFTER GANG SUPPORT THE ELDERLY. HE WILL RECEIVE CALLS LIKE THIS GARY, I CAN'T GET INTO NEWT $ORG  ON THE COMPUTER PHONE AND I ONLY HAVE 166 MORE HOURS ON AMERICAN ONLINE CD. HELLO
