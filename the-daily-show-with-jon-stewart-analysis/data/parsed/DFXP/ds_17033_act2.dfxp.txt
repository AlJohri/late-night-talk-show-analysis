(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. AS YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK JUST THIS PAST WEEK I DECLARED WAR ON CHRISTMAS. IT'S PROBABLY WHY WE HAVEN'T HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT CHRISTMAS RECENTLY. ANYWAY, AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE SANTITY OF CHRISTMAS DAY AND THE ENSUING FOUR-MONTH  LEAD-UP TO CHRISTMAS DAY HAS CHANGED OVER TIME, WE PLAYED A QUICK CLIP FROM THE HISTORY  CHANNEL PROGRAM.
ON DECEMBER 25, 1789, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS SAT IN SESSION AND CONTINUED TO STAY  OPEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY FOR MOST OF THE NEXT 67 YEARS.
Jon: WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED CONGRESS HAD EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE ABOUT THE  SANTITY OF CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS THAT A 7/11 DOES TODAY. YEAH, WE'RE OPEN. A FUNNY STORY. APPARENTLY THE CLIP WE SHOWED WAS OFF BY AROUND 66 YEARS. FOR THIS MISTAKE I WAS AWARDED THE FACT-CHECKING SITE POLITIFACT DOT-COM'S LOWEST  GRADE POSSIBLE "PANTS ON FIRE." SOMETHING THE PEOPLE AT POLITIFACT MUST KNOW THAT A  GENTLEMAN SUCH AS MYSELF IS AKIN TO A DEATH SENTENCE. IN THIS DRY WEATHER MY ASS HAIR IS NOTHING IF NOT KINDLING. OF COURSE, IT'S MY FAULT FOR TRUSTING SOMETHING CALLED THE HISTORY CHANNEL. YOU KNOW, WITH FACTS ABOUT THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WE'LL ALL FIND OUT THE NAZIS DID NOT EMPLOY ALIEN TECHNOLOGY IN  THEIR QUEST FOR WORLD DOMINATION. YOU KNOW WHAT, HISTORY CHANNEL? YOU HAVE (BEEP) ME FOR THE LAST TIME! FROM NOW ON, I GO STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE. TO THE TIME MACHINE. MR. FRANKLIN.
YES.
I'M COME FROM THE FUTURE TO ASK YOU ABOUT HOW THE FOUNDING  FATHER FELT ABOUT CHRISTMAS AND THE CELEBRATIONS AND THINGS.
OKAY.
Jon: IF I'M INTERRUPTING.
NO, NO, STAY. UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE DISCUSSING HISTORICAL CONTEXT WHILE  WATCHING AN OLDER MAN FORNICATE WITH TWO SECOND RATE FRENCH PROSTITUTES.
HEY, WE SPEAK ENGLISH.
Jon: I CAN WAIT.
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE A GUEST. GIRLS. BACK IN FIVE. PLEASE, SIT.
Jon: ON THAT?
THERE WE GO.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE PUREL WON'T BE INVENTED FOR ANOTHER 200 YEARS. OKAY. FIRST OF ALL, I GUESS I SHOULD SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS.
(LAUGHING) I THINK YOUR TIME MACHINE IS BROKEN, FUTUREMAN. AS YOU CAN SEE, IN MY ALMANACK, CHRISTMAS ISN'T FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS.
Jon: YOU DON'T SAY MERRY CHRISTMAS BEFORE THE ACTUAL DAY?
WHY WOULD WE?
Jon: SO HERE IN 1789 WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE, WHAT DO PEOPLE DO ON CHRISTMAS DAY?
WELL, SOME OF US WORK. SOME REFLECT WITH FAMILY. THE MORE COMMON MAN SPENDS THE DAY STUFFING HIS FACE, GETTING DRUNK AND WALLOWING IN VOMIT. OR AS I CALL IT, TUESDAY.
Jon: DON'T ANY OF THE FOUNDERS GO TO CHURCH ON CHRISTMAS?
NO. I HEAR THE UNIVERSALIST OF BOSTON ARE PLANNING THE NATION'S FIRST MAJOR CHRISTMAS  DAY SERVICE THIS YEAR, 1789.
Jon: HOW WEIRD. MY RESEARCHERS READ THE VERY SAME THING IN A HISTORY BOOK RIGHT BEFORE WE WROTE THIS.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE. AND IF I MAY ASK, HOW DO YOU CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS?
Jon: CHINESE FOOD AND A MOVIE, YOU KNOW.
(LAUGHING) OH, YES, YES. OH, I SEE. YOU'RE A HEBREW. WELL, HAPPY HOLIDAY. FROM YOUR NAME I THOUGHT YOU WERE OF THE TUDOR HOUSE.
Jon: I GET THAT AATE LOT. THE HISTORY CHANNEL OFFICES.
THOSE IDIOTS SAY I FLEW A KITE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTRICAL STORM. DO I SEEM SUICIDAL.
THEY GAVE ME A PANTS ON FIRE FOR QUOTING THEM.
SPEAKING OF PANTS ON FIRE, YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY OF THAT FUTURE PENICILLIN ON YOU, DO YOU? ( APPLAUSE )
Jon: IS THAT IT?
THANKS. YOU'RE A REAL (BEEP) SAVER. IT'S A COLONIAL EXPRESSION.
Jon: RIGHT,. WELL, I'VE GOT TO GET BACK.
TO THE FUTURE!
