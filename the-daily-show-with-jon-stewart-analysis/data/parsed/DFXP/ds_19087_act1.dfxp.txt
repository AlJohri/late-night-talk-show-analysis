FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SHOW TONIGHT. WE'VE A BEAUTIFUL SHOW TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUEST MATT TAIBBI, A JOURNALIST, AUTHOR OF "THE DIVIDE:  AMERICAN INJUSTICE IN THE AGE OF THE WEALTH GAP." IT'S A LOVE STORY. IT'S QUITE LOVELY. I ADDED THAT LAST PART. OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT OF COURSE BEGINS IN CONGRESS. LAST WEEK THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE VOTED TO DECLASSIFY A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON OUR COUNTRY'S USE OF UM -- I GUESS WHAT THE C.I.A.  WOULD CALLED SUPER AGGRESSIVE TERRORIST SUSPECT SPA TREATMENTS DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY I ASSUME THAT THE DECLASSIFIED REPORT IS EXCULPATORY AND REAFFIRMS THIS NATION'S COMMITMENT TO THE AMERICAN VALUES.
THE REPORT EXPOSES BRUTALITY THAT STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO OUR VALUES AS A NATION. IT CHRONICLES A STAIN ON OUR HISTORY THAT MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICANS DO.
YES, THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICANS -- EXCEPT WE DID. WE DON'T -- -- WE DON'T DO BUT WE -- LIKE WITH YOUR INTERNMENT CAMPS OR WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE -- SLAVERY -- AMERICA HAS A HISTORY OF DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT WE DON'T DO. [LAUGHTER] WE ARE A MORAL PEOPLE IN HINDSIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT SINCE THE SENATE IS BRINGING ENHANCED INTERROGATION OR FREEDOM QUIZZES UP, [LAUGHTER] LET'S TAKE A STROLL DOWN THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO ERASE FROM OUR MEMORY LANE AND CHECK IN ON HOW THE GENTLEMEN BEHIND THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION PROGRAM ARE DEALING WITH THEIR TWISTED LEGACY. I WAS A STRONG ADVOCATE OF HOW PUT TOGETHER THE ENHANCED INTERROGATION PROGRAM. SOME PEOPLE CALL IT TORTURE. IT WASN'T TORTURE. [LAUGHTER]
IF IT WERE TORTURE I WOULD BE A TERRIBLE PERSON AND -- BUT I'M NOT A TERRIBLE PERSON. I'M LOVELY. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M WARM, I'M ENGAGING, I'M THE TOTAL PACKAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] QUACK. BY THE WAY THAT'S DICK CHENEY DENYING THAT HE TORTURED FROM A ROOM THAT LOOKS LIKE A PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD TORTURE PEOPLE. [LAUGHTER] PERHAPS DANK IS HIS COLOR. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT I KNOW THAT MR. CHENEY SAYS IT WASN'T TORTURE BUT THIS REPORT MADE IT SEEM AWFUL TORTURE-ISH.
THE REPORT ALSO REVEALS A NEW CASE OF ABUSE NEVER BEFORE DISCLOSED. IN 2003 A DETAINEE WAS TAKEN TO A C.I.A. SECRET PRISON NEAR KABUL WHERE HE WAS DUNKED INTO A TUB OF ICE WATER, HELD FORCIBLY UNDER WATER AND REPEATEDLY BEATEN.
SEE UH WE'RE HELPING HIM. THE ICE WATER ACTS AS AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY TO HELP THE BEATINGS HEAL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DOES THE VICE PRESIDENT HAVE ANY REGRETS?
CHENEY WENT ON TO TELL THE NEWSPAPER QUOTE, IF I WOULD HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, I WOULD. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
Jon: HE'S LIKE THE WILFORD BRIMLEY OF TORTURE. HI THIS, IS DICK CHENEY FOR WATERBOARDING. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. [LAUGHTER] WE KNOW THE USE OF WORD TORTURE IS DISPUTED BUT CHENEY SPEAKS ABOUT RESULTS. WHAT ABOUT THESE RESULTS?
THE C.I.A. DESCRIBED ITS PROGRAM REPEATEDLY BOTH TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND EVENTUALLY TO CONGRESS AS GETTING UNIQUE OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE INTELLIGENCE THAT HELPED DISRUPT TERRORIST PLOTS AND SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES. WAS THAT ACTUALLY TRUE? VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY SAID IT WAS TRUE SO I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT IT WASN'T TRUE. I MEAN, IF YOU CAN'T TRUST A MAN THAT SHOT HIS OWN FRIEND IN THE FACE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS A BIRD I DON'T KNOW WHO --
THE ANSWER IS NO.
Jon: I'M SO NAIVE. YOU GOT ME AGAIN. YOU OLD FACE SHOOTING FELLA. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. SO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY'S RESPONSE TO HIS ROLE, YOU LIKE THAT? VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY'S RESPONSE TO HIS ROLE IN THIS SHAMEFUL EPISODE OF AMERICAN HISTORY IS ABJECT BLACK AND WHITE REALITY DENIAL. HOW DOES HIS COHORT DONALD RUMSFELD LIVE WITH HIMSELF, I'M SORRY DEAL WITH IT. LET'S FIND OUT IN A CLIP FROM THIS NEW ERROL MORRIS DOCUMENTARY THE UNKNOWN KNOWN.
WHAT ABOUT THESE SO-CALLED TORTURE MEMOS?
THERE WERE WHAT? THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OR THREE? I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUT THERE WERE NOT ALL OF THESE SO-CALLED MEMOS.
Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT HE DID? THROUGH SHEER SEMANTIC WILL THE MAN DEFLECTED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT WE TORTURED TO ACCUSE HIS QUESTIONER OF THE HIGHER CRIME:  EXAGGERATION OF A MEMO COUNT. AT LONG LAST ERROL MORRIS HAVE YOU NO SHAME? I'M SORRY MR. RUMSFELD. YOU WERE MID TURD POLISH?
THEY WERE MISCHARACTERIZED AS TORTURE MEMOS AND THEY CAME NOT OUT OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PER SE BUT OUT OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BLESSED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERL THE SENIOR LEGAL OFFICIAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVING BEEN NOMINATED BY A PRESIDENT AND CONFIRMED BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY. LITTLE DIFFERENT CAST I JUST PUT ON IT THAN THE ONE YOU DID. I'LL CHALK THAT ONE UP. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: MOMMY? MOMMY, I DON'T WANT TO GO TO GRANDPA'S HE'S GOING TO DO THAT FINGER THING AGAIN. LOOK AT (bleep) PROUD HE IS OF HAVING PUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT WORDS IN BETWEEN BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND TORTURE WHILE NOT IN ANY EXPLICIT WAY CHANGING THE MEANINGS OF THOSE WORDS OR REFUTING THE CHARGE. BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE HAPPY, I'M HAPPY AND I ASSUME THAT IS HAPPINESS AND NOT HIS TEETH TRYING DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE HIS FACE. OF COURSE, RUMSFELD AND CHENEY WERE MERELY PAWNS EXECUTING THE WILL OF THE PUPPET MASTER HIMSELF GEORGE W. BUSH AS THE RELEASE OF RUMSFELD'S DOCUMENTARY COINCIDES WITH CHENEY'S REEMERGENCE AND THE RELEASE OF THESE HERETOFORE CLASSIFIED C.I.A. DOCUMENTS IT IS THE PERFECT CONFLEUENCE OF EVENTS TO CONJURE UP AN APPEARANCE OF THE DECIDER. THE ONLY QUESTION IS IN WHAT CONTEXT WILL HE MAKE HIS RETURN?
GEORGE W. BUSH IS DISPLAYING A SERIES OF HIS PAINTINGS OF WORLD LEADERS PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HE'S A SOMEWHAT CONFOUNDING DUDE. [ LAUGHTER ] YES, MUCH LIKE ANY NONTORTURING WAR STARTING RETIREE, GEORGE W. BUSH'S RETURN TO PUBLIC LIFE WITH LIKE 30 PICTURES HE MADE. NOW WHILE YOUR GRANDPA MAY HAVE CHOSEN THE BEACH OR BIRDS ON HIS BIRD FEEDER AS THEIR SUBJECT, GEORGE W. BUSH HAS GONE WITH OTHER PEOPLE I KNEW WHO RAN COUNTRIES. [LAUGHTER] AND LIKE YOUR GRANDPA HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO SAY ABOUT WHAT HE PAINTED. VLADMIR PUTIN. YES, I MET WITH HIM A LOT DURING THE PRESIDENCY, GOT TO KNOW HIM VERY WELL. I HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP THROUGHOUT.
Jon: I GUESS THE LESSON HERE IS IF YOU VISIT THE BUSH GALLERY YOU NEED NOT SPRING FOR THE AUDIO TOUR. [ LAUGHTER ] YEAH THAT'S THIS LADY SHE'S THE HEAD OF GERMANY. THEY CALLED HER ANGELA, I CALLED HER ANGELA. I DON'T SPEAK GERMAN. [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, AH UH BOOP. HERE IS TONY BLAIR. ENGLISH GUY WITH AN ITALIAN FIRST NAME. NEVER GOT THAT. BOOP AGAIN. THE BOOP IS THE TOUR MOVING ALONG. I SHOULD HAVE BOOP! ANYWAY I'M KIND OF AFRAID TO ASK THIS, BUT WHAT DO PROFESSIONAL ART CRITICS THINK OF THIS?
WHEN I FIRST SAW HIS PAINTINGS I WAS SURE I WOULD HATE THEM BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING KIND OF INNOCENT, SINCERE, EARNEST ALMOST CHILDLIKE.
Jon: THAT'S OUR MAN, SINCERE, EARNEST, ALMOST CHILDLIKE TWO-TERM PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS CAMPAIGN SLOGAN AT ONE TIME. WHEN DID BUSH START PAINTING?
IT ALL STARTED TWO YEARS AGO WITH AN APP. HE CALLED IT COMMUNICATING THROUGH HIS ART, SENDING LOVE NOTES OF SORTS TO HIS FAMILY.
HE'S VERY DISCIPLINED SO HE COMES UP AND WORKS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND WHICH IS WHY HE'S IMPROVED AND CAN DO PORTRAITS OF BOB THE CAT THAT ARE SO GOOD. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: DOES IT SOUND TO ANYONE ELSE LIKE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO COULD SNAP AT ANY MOMENT. NO WE'RE HERE, HIS BOB THE CAT PAINTINGS ARE SO GOOD. HE SEES A CAT NO ONE ELSE SEES. [ LAUGHTER ] THE CAT'S NAME IS BOB. PRETEND YOU SEE IT TOO OR HE GETS ALL AGITATED. [LAUGHTER] I'M GLAD THAT GEORGE W. BUSH FINDS HIS ART TO BE A FULFILLING PURSUIT. I JUST WISH HE COULD HAVE SEEN THIS AD LIKE 30 YEARS EARLIER. [ LAUGHTER ] COULD HAVE SAVED US A LOT OF QUAGMIRES. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
