(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: OH, HELLO. I DIDN'T SEE YOU COME IN. (LAUGHTER) I JUST INTERVIEWED ED GILLESPIE WHO'S NOW THE CHAIRMAN OF THE  REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE AND WE WENT KIND OF LONG. WE HAD A VERY NICE CONVERSATION BUT YOU AT HOME WILL SEE IT CUT OFF. LIKE THAT, AND YOU'RE GOING TO THINK TO YOURSELF OH, MY GOD, MY CABLE! BUT IT'S NOT, IT WENT LONG AND THE REST OF IT IS UP ON THE WEB SO ASK YOUR KIDS. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING. IN YOUR ROLE FOR THE STATE LEADERSHIP, YOU GUYS HAVE TAKEN... THE REPUBLICANS HAVE  TAKEN CONTROL OF MANY OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS. IS THAT CORRECT?
21 FLIPD FROM DEMOCRAT TO REPUBLICAN IN THE NOVEMBER 2 ELECTIONS. WE'VE GOT 690-SEAT GAIN WHICH IS THE MOST EVER FOR EITHER PARTY IN ONE ELECTION. SO IT WAS A GOOD DAY.
Jon: SO HOW MANY NOW OVERALL ARE CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS?
55. SO A MAJORITY OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES ARE REPUBLICAN.
Jon: HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS IS? BECAUSE I TEND TO THINK... YOU SAW THOSE SWING STATES WHEN THEY WERE CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICAN  GOVERNORS THEY TENDED TO THEN-- THE ONES ON THE CUSP THERE-- GO REPUBLICAN. THE ONES THAT WERE CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS TENDED TO GO OVER THERE. IS IT A BIG DEAL?
ALL ALONG THE GREAT LAKES WE MADE HUGE GAINS-- WISCONSIN, MINNESOTA, OHIO, MICHIGAN, INDIANA PICKED UP STATEHOUSES, FLIPPED THEM FROM DEMOCRATIC TO REPUBLICAN. BUT THEN ALSO THIS IS THE YEAR OF THE REDISTRICTING APPORTIONMENT SO THE STATE  LEGISLATURES WILL DRAW THE NEW DISTRICT LINES....
Jon: IS THAT EVERY TEN YEARS THEY DO THAT?
EVERY TEN YEARS AND THIS IS THE YEAR FOR IT AND THAT WILL AFFECT THE CONTROL OF CONGRESS  FOR THE NEXT FIVE CYCLES.
Jon: SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY... THIS COULD BE LIKE A DISTRICT 9 SITUATION. (LAUGHTER) YOU COULD HAVE THE DEMOCRATS-- I DON'T WANT TO SAY IN A GHETTO NECESSARILY--  (LAUGHTER) BUT AT LEAST QUARANTINED.
CORDONED OFF ANYWAY, YEAH.
Jon: CORDONED OFF AND KEPT OUT OF PUBLIC EYE. WHAT IS... IN YOUR MIND WHO ARE THE EXCITING... YOU MOVED MICHAEL STEELE. YOU WERE HELPING ROOINS PRIX BUS GET SETTLED. YOU SUPPORTED HIM OVER MICHAEL STEELE. AS A COMEDIAN, THAT HURT ME. (LAUGHTER)
I SUSPECT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S GAIN IS "THE DAILY SHOW'S" LOSS, JON. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
Jon: STEELE WAS THE WHOLE PACKAGE. HE WAS A FIVE-TOOL COMEDIC MAN. RINS PRIXS BY HAS THE NAME.
GOOD NAME, GREAT NAME.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS THE COMEDIC CHOPS.
I DON'T KNOW FE F HE'LL BE AS QUOTABLE. HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB. HE HAS A TOUGH JOB. THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS $22 MILLION IN DEBT AND FILLING THAT HOLE IS NOT  GOING TO BE EASY.
Jon: I ASKED MICHAEL STEELE ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICANS RAN ON THIS IDEA OF WE ARE THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY, WE ARE THE GROWN-UPS. IT TURNS OUT OUR COMMITTEE... TURNS OUT THEY'RE JUVENILE DELINQUENTS. (LAUGHTER) SO THEY HAVE A $22 MILLION DEFICIT. HOW DO YOU RUN ON FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THAT IS WHEN THE FUN DECONTAMINATION OF YOUR  PARTY IS...
YOU HAVE TO START BY ELIMINATING THAT DEFICIT WOULD BE A NICE WAY TO START. SECONDLY IT'S DONATION NOT TAX DOLLARS TO SO PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY GIVE, A LITTLE DIFFERENCE. BUT IT'S A LEGITIMATE POINT. WE'VE GOT TO ELIMINATE THAT DEBT AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE THAT JOKE  THAT THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN BEING THE R.N.C. CHAIRMAN IS BEING THE FORMER R.N.C. CHAIRMAN  WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO RAISE THAT MONEY.
Jon: HOW DO THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE FUND-RAISING THING YOUR  EXPENDITURES ARE JUST ON CAMPAIGNS. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN STOP A WAR AGAINST ANOTHER... YOU KNOW, YOU  ARE THE R.N.C., YOU'RE NOT AT WAR WITH BELGIUM. YOU CAN'T CUT YOUR DEFENSE BUDGET, I GUESS IS WHAT I'M SAYING.
THE DONORS SEE IN CHAIRMAN PRIEBUS IS SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO SPEND IT WISELY. AND THE... THE PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE, THE R.N.C. IS THE ONLY FEDERAL COMMITTEE THAT CAN  COORDINATE WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF WHOEVER OUR NOMINEE WILL BE.
Jon: YOU GUYS HAVE YOUR INSTRUMENTAL STARTING THIS CROSS ROADS AND CROSS ROADS G.P.S. WHICH IS ALSO RAISING MONEY TO PUT OUT THERE. ARE THOSE EVER AT ODDS? YOU'RE WITH THE R.N.C., YOU'RE THIS OTHER GROUP RAISING MONEY FOR ADS. ARE THEIR GOALS EVER AT ODDS AND IF SO WHO DO YOU... WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE?
WELL, I'M FOR BOTH OF THEM AND THE AMERICAN CROSS ROADS AND  THESE OUTSIDE GROUPS ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE FORMED IN RESPONSE TO A LOT OF GROUPS THAT  WERE OUT THERE ON THE LEFT AND FOLKS WHO WERE MORE LEFT LEANING WOULD GIVE TO THE DEMOCRATIC  NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS OR MOVING AMERICA FORWARD AND THE SAME HERE. IF PEOPLE GIVE TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND AMERICAN CROSS ROADS AND OTHER GROUPS.
BUT ONE CAN BE SLIGHTLY MORE IDEOLOGICAL, I GUESS MY POINT. SO IN THE SENSE OF... IN THE LAST ELECTION SOME REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING GEEZ, WHEN WE WENT  WITH MORE THE IDEOLOGICAL TEA PARTIERS WE LOST SEATS THAT WE COULD HAVE WON WHEREAS IF WE HAD  GONE WITH PRAGMATIC APPROACH WE WOULD HAVE WON EVEN MORE SEATS, MAYBE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE SENATE AS WELL AND THE HOUSE AND JUDICIARY AND CANADA. (LAUGHTER) S WHERE YOUR HEAD AT. ARE YOU MORE OLD SCHOOL OR INSURGENT? (LAUGHTER)
I THINK THAT THE TEA PARTY HAS BEEN... BROUGHT INCREDIBLE ENERGY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  THAT THE FACT THAT....
Jon: THEY'RE VERY ENERGETIC.
WE WOULDN'T HAVE WON THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  WITHOUT... WE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE 63 SEAT GAIN IN THE HOUSE  AND TAKEN CONTROL IF NOT FOR TEA PARTY VOTERS. A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE ARE SAYING WE'VE GOT TO HOLD BOTH PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE. TEA PARTY VOTERS ARE SKEPTICAL OF BOTH PARTIES AND REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO EARN THEIR TRUST.
Jon: WELL, MEH. THEY'RE REPUBLICANS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, THEY'RE VOTING REPUBLICAN, THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. BUT THEY ARE SKEPTICAL OF....
Jon: DO YOU THINK THE SOCIAL ISSUES... YOU KNOW WILL LOOM AS LARGE? IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE TRYING TO... ARE I KNOW YOU'RE CRITICAL  OF REPUBLICANS THAT HAVE TAKEN SUCH A HARD STANCE AGAINST IMMIGRATION AND A HARD STANCE  AGAINST SOME OF THE SOCIALISMS. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING TO SOFTEN AGAINST?
THEY ARE ALWAYS IMPORTANT ISSUES AND WE SHOULDN'T DIMINISH THEM. I'M A PRO-LIFE PERSON AND I BELIEVE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT'S NOT THE TOP OF MY RESPONSE TO MOST VOTERS RIGHT NOW. MOST VOTERS WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE THEY SAY JOBS AND THE ECONOMY  AND THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS OF THE DEBATE IS.
Jon: THAT'S AN INTERESTING... YOU SAY JOBS AND THE ECONOMY. I'VE NOTICED THAT THE REPUBLICANS RAN ON THIS IDEA OF JOBS AND JUST RECENTLY JOHN  BOEHNER HAS SAID WELL, IF OUR CUTS TO GOVERNMENT CAUSE PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS-- I THINK THE  PHRASE HE USED WAS "SO BE IT." WHICH SEEMS NOT ONLY FILLED WITH EMPATHY... (LAUGHTER) BUT SOMEONE ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT HE HAD SAID EARLIER ABOUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT JOBS. IT SEEMS THEY DON'T CARE SO MUCH IF THE JOBS ARE HELD BY DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. THEY DON'T... THEY WANT TO PRESERVE OTHER...
THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO HOLD GOVERNMENT JOBS, TOO. FEWER I WOULD SUSPECT THAN....
Jon: WILL THOSE GET TO STAY? (LAUGHTER)
LET'S CHECK THE REGISTRATION. THE FACT IS THAT WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AND AS WE'RE  DIVERTING MONEY OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO HIGHER TAXES INTO GOVERNMENT SECTOR THAT  WE'RE DIMINISHING PRIVATE SECTOR GROWTH AND THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER.
Jon: WOULD YOU REMOVE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO BUSINESS? WOULD YOU REMOVE TAX BREAKS FOR OFFSHORE COMPANIES? WOULD YOU REMOVE THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY FREE MARKET?
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FLATTER LOWER TAX RATE THAT DIDN'T  SUBSIDIZE-- APART FROM DIRECT FEDERAL SUBSIDY OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRYS WHICH I  THINK DISTORTS THE MARKETS AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT PEOPLE IN  WASHINGTON ARE SMART ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE'S MONEY OUGHT TO GO AS PEOPLE ARE ABOUT WHERE THEIR  MONEY OUGHT TO GO.
Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS. I CANNOT LET THIS GO IN GOOD CONSCIOUS. YOU'RE NOT WEARING A FLAG PIN AND IT DOES MAKE ME THINK YOU MIGHT BE A MUSLIM. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) ED GILLESPIE! (CH
