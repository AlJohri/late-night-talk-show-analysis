FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW. OH, IT'S GOOD SHOW. MY GUEST TONIGHT, JENNIFER ESPOSITO. SHE'S AN ACTRESS, BUT ALSO SHE'S GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT HER BOOK. SHE'S GOT WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THERE, CELIAC DISEASE. IT'S NAMED AFTER A BALLPLAYER, LOU CELIAC. PLAYED FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, FOR MOST OF ITS EXISTENCE, THE IRS WAS AMERICA'S FAVORITE GOVERNMENT AGENCY. [LAUGHTER] BUT THAT ALL CHANGED AFTER THE IRS ADMITTED LAST YEAR TO CERTAIN IMPROPRIETIES.
TEA PARTY AND OTHER CONSERVATIVE GROUPS THAT ROSE TO POWER EARLY IN THE PRESIDENT'S FIRST TERM WERE UNFAIRLY TARGETED FOR SPECIAL SCRUTINY BY THE I.R.S.
Jon: BY THE WAY, WHATEVER YOU THINK OF THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT, I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE ONLY GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT SHOULD BE SINGLING IT OUT FOR SPECIAL SCRUTINY IS THE FASHION POLICE. I MEAN, PANTALOONS? COME ON. COME ON. PANTALOONS? THAT IS SO "BENAJMIN FRUMPLIN." WELL ANYWAY, SINCE THEN IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THE IRS ALSO TARGETED LIBERAL 501C-4s BUT NOT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF SCRUTINY THAT THEY APPLIED TO THE CONSERVATIVES. SO, THAT'S SOMETHING. NOW, I KNOW THE RIGHT WANTS THAT SOMETHING TO BE THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA ORDERED THE IRS TO TARGET THEM WHILE HE SAT IN A DARK ROOM SMOKING A CIGAR, STROKING A CAT, WHILST AN ORPHAN BOY STANDS OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN, LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW SAYING, "WHY? WHY, MR. PRESIDENT? WHY." BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE'S BEEN NO REAL EVIDENCE FOUND THAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS INVOLVED AND THE CAT TURNED OUT TO BE A DOG AND THE ORPHAN ACTUALLY HAS PARENTS AND WAS PUTTING ON A BRITISH ACCENT. BUT THE POINT IS THIS. THESE IRS TROUBLES DO NOT APPEAR TO BE THAT. BUT THEY ARE SOMETHING. AND THE IRS IS CLEARLY DOING THEIR BEST TO CONTINUE TO GIVE OFF SCANDAL STINK LIKE SOME KIND OF SCARED SCANDAL SKUNK. [LAUGHTER] WHEN WE LAST LEFT THE IRS, THEIR OFFICIAL, LOIS LERNER, HAD TAKEN THE FIFTH, RATHER THAN TESTIFY, IN FRONT OF CONGRESS, SO CONGRESS ASKED THE IRS IF THEY WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO CLICK THE FORWARD BUTTON ON ALL OF LOIS LERNER'S E-MAILS. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT?
THEY SAY THE IRS HAS BEEN PROMISING TO GET THEM THESE E-MAILS FOR A YEAR, AND NOW SUDDENLY SAYS THAT LOIS LERNER'S COMPUTER CRASHED WAY BACK IN 2011 AND THAT MANY OF THOSE E-MAILS ARE JUST GONE.
WELL, THAT'S IRRITATING. COMPUTERS DO CRASH. E-MAILS ARE LOST, BUT TYPICALLY FINDING THAT OUT, THAT INFORMATION, TAKES LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO GESTATE A MANATEE. [LAUGHTER] A YEAR? COME ON! WELL, FIRST CONGRESS HAD TO FILL OUT FORM 1218A SUB E-Z. THAT'S AN E-MAIL REQUISITION FORM FOR OUR RECORDS. THEN WE THROW THAT FORM INTO A ROOM FILLED WITH CHIMPS. THEN... [LAUGHTER] THEN WHAT WE DID IS WE TRAINED THE CHIMPS TO READ. [LAUGHTER] SO THINGS WERE LOOKING GOOD. THAT'S WHEN, UNFORTUNATELY, THE CHIMPS UNIONIZED. SO THAT WAS A WHOLE THING. BUT FINALLY WE NEGOTIATED A CONTRACT. FINALLY WE DELIVERED A CONTRACT THE CHIMPS DIDN'T THROW THEIR FECES AT. THE POINT IS E-MAIL REQUISITIONS ARE NOW DONE THROUGH A DIFFERENT FORM, SO IF YOU COULD REAPPLY, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. SO IT IS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT THE NEW IRS COMMISSIONER JOHN...REALLY? YOU LIKE THAT? THE NEW IRS COMMISSIONER, JOHN KOSKINEN, KOS-KINE-N, KOSKINEN I'LL GO WITH, HE COMES BEFORE CONGRESS TO TESTIFY. I WONDER IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE DICKS TO HIM.
PLEASE RISE TO TAKE THE OATH. AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND. A LITTLE HIGHER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WOW. THAT WAS EASY. NOW TURN AROUND AND WIGGLE. SERIOUSLY THOUGH, WHILE WE ALL MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT TO THE HEAD OF THE IRS, WHAT DOES RAISING YOUR HAND HIGHER HAVE TO DO WITH TELLING THE TRUTH? UH, I CAN LIE. WAIT, I CAN LIE. HOLD ON. I CAN LIE. I CAN LIE. I CAN LIE. I CAN NO LONGER LIE! FOR MY HAND IS TOO CLOSE TO GOD. THAT'S HIM SCRATCHING GOD'S BEARD. HELLO! BUT, ALRIGHT. ENOUGH CATHARTIC PUBLIC SHAMING. WHERE ARE THE DAMN E-MAILS?
THE ACTUAL HARD DRIVE, AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS DYSFUNCTIONAL AND THAT WITH EXPERTS NO E-MAILS COULD BE RETRIEVED WAS RECYCLED AND DESTROYED IN THE NORMAL PROCESS.
SO WAS IT PHYSICALLY DESTROYED?
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.
SO WAS IT MELTED DOWN, DO YOU KNOW?
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE RECYCLER DOES WITH IT.
Jon: FOR ALL I KNOW LOIS LERNER'S HARD DRIVE WAS GROUND INTO A FINE DUST, SPRINKLED LIKE PARMESAN ONTO A LASAGNA THAT WAS SERVED TO THOSE IN THIS VERY CHAMBER. [LAUGHTER] SO I SAY TO YOU, CONGRESS, IF YOU WANT TO SEE ALL OF LOIS LERNER'S E-MAILS, YOU MUST LOOK INSIDE YOURSELVES. OR, OR YOU COULD... OR YOU COULD WAIT. BY THE WAY, THAT IS A KILLER THAT GUY IMPRESSION. THAT I WILL USE FOR THE REST OF MY CAREER. [LAUGHTER] SO UP UNTIL NOW, THE WHOLE THING IS ANNOYING. BUT NOT QUITE GALLING. HERE'S WHERE IT GETS SOMEWHAT GALLING.
THE IRS HAS HISTORICALLY ONLY PRESERVED BACK-UP TAPES FOR SIX MONTHS.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHTER] THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY WHOSE ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL RELIES ON FORCING AMERICANS TO LIVE AS BORDERLINE HOARDERS... [LAUGHTER] ONLY KEEPS THEIR [BLEEPED] FOR SIX MONTHS? NO. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] NO, THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER GET A NOTICE FROM THE IRS SAYING PLEASE BRING YOUR RECORDS DOWN TO US... IF YOU CAN FIND THEM. I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE IF THE E.P.A. WAS DUMPING ITS OFFICE TRASH IN THE NATIONAL ZOO'S SPOTTED OWL EXHIBIT. [LAUGHTER] MEANING IT WOULD BE IRONIC. BUT EVEN IF THE IRS DELETED THE TAPES, WHY CAN'T THEY JUST GET THE E-MAILS FROM HER INBOX. SPOILER ALERT: IT'S STUPID AND PREVENTABLE. EACH IRS EMPLOYEE'S E-MAIL BOX BACK THEN ONLY HELD 150 MEGABYTES OF INFORMATION. ALSO KNOWN AS FIVE PICTURES OF YOUR FAMILY. OR ONE PICTURE OF ANTHONY WEINER'S [BLEEPED]. BOOM! BOOM! [BLEEPED] [BLEEPED] YEAH. HE HAS A SOMEWHAT LARGE PENIS. 150 MEGABYTES. THAT'S 1% OF WHAT GMAIL OFFERS YOU FOR FREE. AND THAT COMES WITH A GOOGLE PLUS ACCOUNT FOR YOU TO NOT USE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BUILT AN ENTIRE COMPLEX IN THE DESERTS OF UTAH TO STORE EVERYTHING AMERICANS HAVE EVER SAID TO EACH OTHER. BUT INTERGOVERNMENT CONVERSATIONS? [LAUGHTER] I DON'T KNOW. BUY A [BLEEPED] THUMB DRIVE. IF THERE IS A LARGER SCANDAL HERE, IT'S THAT OUR GOVERNMENT'S HANDLING OF INFORMATION ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS BORDERS ON CRIMINAL IDIOCY. THE IRS IS FRYING HARD DRIVES, THE V.A. IS DROWNING IN PAPER. IS THERE ANY RECORD KEEPING MEDIUM THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD USE THAT COULD WORK FOR THEM? MICROFICHE? WE'LL DO IT. STONE TABLETS? WE'LL DO IT. WE COULD TAKE A PAGE OUT OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS. WEAVE ALL OF OUR IMPORTANT INFORMATION INTO AN EPIC POEM AND RECITED ENTIRELY FROM MEMORY, PASSED DOWN OVER GENERATIONS AS PART OF A FEDERAL ARCHIVAL ORAL TRADITION FROM BARD TO APPRENTICE, BUT YOU'D PROBABLY LOSE THAT [BLEEPED] PAGE. UNLESS, WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. YOU'RE TIRED OF GOVERNING US, AREN'T YOU? AND SO YOU'RE KIND OF ACTING LIKE ASSHOLES SO WE BREAK UP WITH YOU. WELL, LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE NOT PERFECT AS CONSTITUENTS AND WE'VE BEEN IN THIS RELATIONSHIP FOR 200 YEARS, PROBABLY TAKE YOU A LITTLE BIT FOR GRANTED. WE WANT EVERYTHING AND DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR ANYTHING. [LAUGHTER] EVERY YEAR ON YOUR BIRTHDAY WE THROW A HUGE PARTY AND PRETEND IT'S FOR YOU, BUT IT'S REALLY JUST A CHANCE FOR US TO GET [BLEEPED] UP AND STARE AT THE SKY BETWEEN 9:00 P.M. AND 9:25. LOOK, THE POINT IS THIS, GOVERNMENT. NO MATTER WHAT YOU GET RIGHT, WE'RE STILL GOING TO FIND THAT ONE THING YOU GOT WRONG AND SIGN A PETITION ABOUT IT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T NEED YOU, BABY. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS: JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TOTALLY UNREASONABLE DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO BE TOTALLY INCOMPETENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
