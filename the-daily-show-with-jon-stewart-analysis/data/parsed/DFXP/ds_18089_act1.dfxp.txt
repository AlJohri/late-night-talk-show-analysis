FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WHAT A SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. FROM THE HIT SHOW MAD MAN  CHRISTINA HENDRICKS WILL BE  JOINING US IN A LITTLE BIT. BUT, FOLKS, A LOT HAS HAPPENED  SINCE WE LAST SPOKE ON THURSDAY. FOR A COUNTRY WHOSE POLITICAL  INSTITUTIONS HAVE IN MANY WAYS  STUNNED MERCURY SENTLY WITH THE LACK OF COURAGE AND COMPETENCE,  IT WAS REFRESHING TO SEE SOME OF  OUR CIVIC INSTITUTIONS DISPLAYING BOTH TRAITS IN FULL  FORCE: CARING FOR THE WOUNDED,  TRACKING DOWN, KILLING AND/OR CAPTURING PERPS, WE CALL THEM  PERPS IN THE MAKE-BELIEVE LAW  ENFORCEMENT TRADE. DOING IT ALL WITHIN ONE WEEK OR  TO PUT THAT IN POLITICAL SENATE  TERMS, THREE FILIBUSTERS AND A SECRET POLL. AS ALWAYS AFTER THE CRISIS  PASSES, THOUGHTS TURN TO WHAT  DOES THIS MEAN? FIRST, REFLECTIONS FROM  OVERSEAS.
THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS A  EUROPEAN COUNTRY. IT'S A DIFFERENT THING THAN  CHECHNYA.
Jon: THAT IS THE CZECH  REPUBLIC AMBASSADOR FEELING THE  JUSTIFIED NEED TO EXPLAIN TO AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE THAT TWO  SIMILAR-SOUNDING FOREIGN NATIONS  ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME  NATION. I INTERRUPTED YOU. PLEASE GO ON.
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN SEEING  THINGS ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA THAT  PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND CHECHNYA. THE SCHEM REPUBLIC IS A COUNTRY  OF CENTRAL EUROPE AND YOUR NATO  ALLY.
Jon: WHO SAID THE CZECH  REPUBLIC WASN'T AN ALLY. DO YOU REALLY THINK WE WOULD  OVERREACT TO A TERROR ATTACK ON  OUR SOIL BY INVADING A COUNTRY THAT HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO  DO WITH... (LAUGHING). ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). ALL RIGHT. WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU CALLING US STUPID? THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL TO GET A  COUNTRY BOMBED. NO, NO DISRESPECT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS HERE IN  AMERICA, THIS TRAGEDY ABSOLUTELY  DEMONSTRATES THE INTENSE URGENCY OF WHATEVER ISSUE WAS ALREADY  YOUR PRECONCEIVED PRIORITY.
WE'RE ADDRESSING A BROKEN  IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. WHAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON AND  INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM I THINK  SHOULD URGE US TO ACT QUICKER NOT SLOWER WHEN IT COMES TO  GETTING THE 11 MILLION IDENTIFY.
Jon: IMMIGRATION REFORM MUST  PROCEED POSTHASTE.
GIVEN THE EVENTS OF THIS WEEK  IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO  UNDERSTAND THE GAPS AND LOOPHOLES IN OUR IMMIGRATION  SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE...
Jon: WE NEED TO SLOW  IMMIGRATION DOWN. IN THE WAKE OF THE BOSTON TERROR  ATTACK THE ONLY THING MORE  IMPORTANT THAN GETTING IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE IS  SLOWING IMMIGRATION REFORM DOWN. YOU'RE WELCOME. THIS IS A BIT OF A RORSCHACH  CRIME IN THE SAME WAY YOU MIGHT  LOOK AT THIS RORSCHACH BLOT AND SEE A BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY  SITTING ON A PENIS. WHEREAS OTHERS MIGHT LOOK AT  THAT RORSCHACH AND SEE AN  ANNOYING BUTTERFLY BLOCKING MY VIEW OF THAT PENIS. SHOO, SHOO.
OUR NEXT GUEST IS FACING  MOUNTING CRITICISM FOR A TWEET  SENT MOMENTS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF THE SECOND BOMBING SUSPECT. NEW YORK STATE SENATOR GREG BALL  WROTE THIS. SO [BLEEP] NUMBER 2 IN CUSTODY. WHO WOULDN'T USE TORTURE ON THIS  PUNK TO SAVE MORE LIVES?
Jon: I GET IT. WE'RE ALL A LITTLE EMOTIONAL ON  TWITTER. YOU'RE WATCHING SOMETHING. YOU GET CHARGED UP. YOU MIGHT END UP IMPULSIVELY  ADVOCATING TORTURE OR GETTING IN  A FLAME WAR WITH A BELIEVER. I'M SORRY. I THINK ANNE FRANK IS MORE OF A  ONE-DIRECTION TYPE GAL. ANY OTHER VERSIONS OF THE  BOMBING'S REAL LESSON.
IN WATERTOWN THEY'RE GOING  DOOR TO DOOR. THERE WAS A REAL CONCERN THAT  THIS FELL OAL MIGHT BE ON THE  LOOSE. MIGHT BREAK INTO THEIR HOUSE AND  MIGHT TAKE HOSTAGES. WOULD PEOPLE HAVE LIKED TO HAVE  GUNS SNIEM SURE. THAT WOULD HAVE MADE EVERYTHING  GO MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY IF ONLY  EVERYONE HAD GUNS AND BOMBS AND WHATEVER THE [BLEEP] THEY COULD  GET THEIR HANDS ON. LET ME PLAY YOU THE ACTUAL  FOOTAGE OF THIS GUY'S ARREST. YOU NEEDED A HELMET. THAT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED. TARANTINO LISTENS TO THAT AND  GOES, TONE IT DOWN. TOO MUCH. FOR ALL THE CONJECTURE THERE ARE  NOW A FEW THINGS WE DO KNOW FOR  SURE ABOUT TERROR SUSPECTS. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY AASIF  MANDVI LIVE IN BOSTON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THANK YOU, JON. Jon: YOU'VE BEEN UP IN  BOSTON. YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS  STORY FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE  SUSPECT SO FAR.
I CAN TELL YOU THIS, JON. WHEN THEY FIRST RELEASED THOSE  PHOTOS, MUSLIMS ALL OVER AMERICA  SAID, "THANK GOD THEY ARE NOT MUSLIM."
Jon: RIGHT. BUT THEN ON... ON FRIDAY WE  FOUND OUT THEY WERE MUSLIMS.
YEAH BUT NOT MUSLIM-MUSLIM. Jon: YOU MEAN BECAUSE THEY'RE  WHITE.
NOT JUST WHITE. THE WHITEST OF WHITE. I MEAN, THEY WERE LITERALLY FROM  CAULK ASIA.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY IN PEOPLE'S  EYES, IT CAN STILL LINK ISLAM TO  TERRORISM. WHY DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE  THAT THEY'RE WHITE?
IT MEANS NO ONE WILL BE  YELLING AT ME ON THE STREET FOR  THE NEXT MONTH. OKAY. I MEAN, THEY'LL STILL SAY, HEY,  KUMAR, CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH? I'M OKAY WITH THAT. NOW THE BIGOTS HAVE TO GET  CREATIVE. GOOD LUCK COMING UP FOR SLURS  WITH CHECHENS. GO BACK WHERE YOU CAME FROM,  USHANKA-HEAD.
Jon: IS THAT A REAL THING OR  A SLUR YOU MADE UP.
IT'S THEIR DISTINCTIVE FUR  HAT, JON. I HAD TO LOOK IT UP ON  WIKIPEDIA. THAT'S HOW HARD IT IS GOING TO  BE.
Jon: I'M NOT SURE THAT COMING  UP WITH NO ETHNIC STEREOTYPES IS  REALLY THE MOST PRODUCTIVE USE OF OUR TIME RIGHT NOW.
HAVE YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA,  JON? I CAN'T MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF  THIS MESS. THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT THESE  GUYS THE HARDER IT IS TO GET A  HANDLE ON IT.
Jon: CHECHENS. CHECHNYA MIGHT AS WELL BE A  SUBURB OF NARNIA. FOR 12 YEARS AMERICANS HAVE BEEN  TOLD A NICE LITTLE STORY ABOUT  WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE AND WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. AND THEN ALONG COME THESE TWO. THE MUSLIM. THEY'RE WHITE. THEY'RE IMMIGRANTS BUT THEY'RE  AMERICANS. THEY'RE ATHLETES. DZHOKHAR IS A MONSTER YET KIND  OF A HOTTIE.
Jon: I GET THAT. THEY'RE FROM THE SUBURBS YET  THEY LIKE THE HIP HOP.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ONE IS  DIFFICULT. BUT THE POINT IS THERE'S TOO  MUCH GOING ON WITH THESE GUYS. EVEN THE GUYS' NAMES. DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV. IT'S LIKE HE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE  EVERY LETTER OF THE AL A BET IN  THERE. YOU CAN ANAGRAM TO SPELL  ANYTHING FROM OVERT HAZARD SHANK  TO ZACK EFRON SUCKS TO JELLO PUDDING POPS. CAN'T GET MORE AMERICAN THAN  THAT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: YELLOW PUDDING POPS? THE LAST FEW, AASIF, I'M PRETTY  SURE AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE WERE  NOT ACTUALLY ANAGRAMS.
I DO NOT KNOW HOW ANAGRAMS  WORK, JON.
Jon: AASIF MANDVI, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT B
