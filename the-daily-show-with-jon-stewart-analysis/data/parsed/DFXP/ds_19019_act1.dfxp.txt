FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT OUR GUEST, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS, MONIQUE BRINSON DEMERY. SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF "FINDING THE DRAGON LADY" IT'S ABOUT MY PROM. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE OF ALL OF LAST NIGHT'S BIG ELECTIONS WITH INDECISION 2013, WAIT, THERE WAS AN ELECTION IN 2013, EDITION. FIRST UP. CLOSE TO HOME, NEW YORK CITY ELECTED WORLD'S TALLEST HUMAN BILL DE BLASIO, AS ITS MAYOR. DE BLASIO CAMPAIGNED ON PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM OF ECONOMIC PARITY AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY. OBVIOUSLY THIS TYPE OF SOCIAL CHANGE TAKES TIME.
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP] LOCK YOUR DOORS. LA REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN. DE BLASIO WON IN A BLOWOUT CRUSHING HIS OPPONENT JOE LHOTA BY 49 PERCENTAGE POINTS AT WHICH POINT LHOTA WAS SWALLOWED UP BY ANGRY ZOMBIES. SOMEBODY GET THE GUY AN APPLE BOX, THE YELLOW PAGES TO STAND ON? MEANWHILE IN VIRGINIA'S GOVERNOR RACE, TERRY McAULIFFE STRUCK A BLOW FOR CORRUPT GOVERNMENT BY DEFEATING TEA PARTY ARCHETYPE AND NOTED SODOMY OPPONENT KEN YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO STICK IN IN THE CUCH, CUCCHINELLI. IN NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRISTIE CRUISED TO A RE-ELECTION WIN OVER HIS OPPONENT RANDOM  DEMOCRAT, NOBODY REALLY KNOWS. CHRISTIE CELEBRATED BY WEIRDING EVERYBODY OUT.
TONIGHT FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, NEW JERSEY, FOR MAKING ME THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: DID NEW JERSEY MARRY CHRIS CHRISTIE LAST NIGHT? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO OUR SOULS DURING YOUR SPEECH? OKAY, CHRIS. SO CHRISTIE AND McAULIFFE, OBVIOUSLY THESE ELECTIONS WILL HAVE SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE POLICIES OF THESE TWO GREAT STATES, RAMIFICATIONS THAT IMPACT REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES. FOR MORE ON THE SUBSTANTIVE POLICY EFFECT OF THESE ELECTIONS, WE GO TO OUR NEWS ANALYSIS. I'M JUST [BLEEP] WITH YOU. SET THE SPECULOMETER TO THREE YEARS HENCE.
WHAT DOES THE NEW JERSEY RACE SAY ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE'S PROSPECTS IN 2016.
McAULIFFE CAME OUT ON TOP, WHAT IT MEANS FOR 2016.
WHAT DO THE RESULTS SAY ABOUT THE TEA PARTY.
IF VIRGINIA IS IN PLAY, OHIO IS IN PLAY.
THIS WAS A GREAT NIGHT FOR THE DEMOCRATS.
NOT A GREAT NIGHT FOR THE TEA PARTY.
SHOULD CONSERVATIVES BE NERVOUS.
IF VIRGINIA IS IN PLAY, FLORIDA IS IN PLAY. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR TED CRUZ'S CAMPAIGN? WHAT COULD IT MEAN FOR POSSIBLE HILLARY CLINTON RUN?
THE DEFEAT AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR RUBIO.
2013 TURNS INTO 2014, WE BEGIN TO THINK OF 2016.
Jon: TO INFINITY AND BEYOND! YOU KNOW WHAT, THE BEST [BLEEP] NEWS JOINS ME, BEST NEWS TEAM FOR MORE ON LAST NIGHT'S ELECTION. WITH US TONIGHT WE HAVE GOT SIR AASIF MANDVI, JASON JONES ESQUIRE AND DR. AL MADRIGAL. ONCE AGAIN THE MEDIA SPENDS MONTHS AND MONTHS SPECULATING ON WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS ELECTION, WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THIS ELECTION. THEN ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTION THEY SPEND 10 MINUTES REPORTING ON WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND JUMP RIGHT BACK INTO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.
IT'S PATHETIC.
EMBARRASSING.
YEAH,  [BLEEP] THOSE GUYS.
THEY WERE WAY OFF.
WAY OFF, THEY WERE-- .
Jon: WAIT, THEY WERE WAY OFF?
YES, THE MESSAGE OF THIS ELECTION IS CLEAR, TERRY McAULIFFE'S WIN PROVES IN 2016 DEMOCRATS WILL NOMINATE TERRY McAULIFFE.
Jon: WAIT, TERRY McAULIFFE? THAT IS IDIOTIC.
HE WON.
Jon: HE WON ONE ELECTION, THAT'S --
HOW DO YOU NOT GET THAT?
IT'S MATH, JON.
Jon: THIS ELECTION PROVES THEN FOR THE REPUBLICANS THAT CHRIS CHRISTIE WILL BE THE NOMINEE IN 2016, IS THAT RIGHT.
JON--  (LAUGHTER)
SWEET, SWEET BRAIN DAMAGED JON. (LAUGHTER) LET ME MASH UP THIS NEWS AND SPOON-FEED IT TO YOU. BASED ON LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS WE CAN ABSOLUTELY SEE THAT IN 2016 REPUBLICAN VOTERS WILL WANT A TOUGH TALKING NO-NONSENSE NON TEA PARTY NORTHEASTERNER WHO HAS HAD LAP BAND SURGERY.
Jon: SO GOVERNOR CHRISTIE.
CHRISTIE, NO, OPEN YOUR EARS, MAN. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS REX RYAN. A BLUE BLOODED NORTHERNER, A BIG SALTY PRESENCE AND HAS THE FLUCTUATING WEIGHT THAT AMERICA's ELECTORATE IS CLEARLY CLAMOURING FOR AND HE PROVED HE'S NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.
GREAT ANALYSIS RIGHT THERE.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS-- AL, YOU ARE BUYING THIS, YOU ARE BUYING THIS?
NOT REALLY, JON. FOR MY MONEY THE REAL MESSAGE FROM YESTERDAY'S ELECTION IS AMERICANS ARE THIRSTY FOR A SPANISH-SPEAKING ITALIAN AMERICAN SASQUATCH OF A MAN IF AND I SAY THIS IF THEY ARE ALSO MARRIED TO A FORMER BLACK LESBIAN.
Jon: YOU MEAN A BLACK FORMER LESBIAN BECAUSE --
DO I? CLEARLY SHE EXPERIMENTED WITH BOTH AND STUCK WITH ONE.
Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE GOING WAY OUT ON A LIMB HERE.
I THINK IT'S SMART POLITICAL ANALYSIS.
SHREWD EXPERTISE.
MAKING UP [BLEEP] BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCE FOR BEING WRONG (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SEE THAT'S MY POINT. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS TRUE. THESE ARE FROM THEIR PAST BIG ELECTORAL NIGHT PREDICTIONS.
WHAT DOES 2010 MEAN FOR 2012.
I TELL HOW THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS GOING TO BE. MARCO RUBIO, PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.
SARAH PALIN.
I SAY HILLARY CLINTON ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN, SHE'S GOT THE MONEY.
I THINK THAT PERSON IS MIKE HUCKABEE.
MARCO RUBBIO 2012, VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR 2012.
SUBWAY SERIES, IT'S RUDY VERSUS HILLARY IN 2008.
YEAH, SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT.
Jon: THEY WERE ALL COMPLETELY WRONG.
AND THEY ARE ALL STILL ON TV.
YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YEAH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHOOO!
AASIF MANDVI, JASON JONES AND AL MADRIGAL, EVERYBODY.
