Jon: WELCOME BACK. IT SEEMS AT A ONCE PROUD AMERICAN SPORT IS IN TROUBLE.
NASCAR HAS STRUGGLED IN RECENT YEARS HURT BY THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION.
THE SPORT IS IN A FIGHT FOR SPONSOR DOLLARS.
NASCAR'S RATING 10% DOWN.
SOME SAY I'VE GOTTEN STALE.
HOW COULD PEOPLE GET BORED WATCHING SOMEONE DRIVE IN A CIRCLE AGAIN AND AGAIN.
Jon: LUCKILY HERE TO LEND HIS EXPERTISE IS JOHN HODGMAN IN  HIS SEGMENT:  YOU'RE WELCOME. ♪ ♪
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE JOHN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ALL RIGHT. I LIKE THIS. I LIKE THIS. IS THAT A MUSTACHE IN HONOR OF YOUR BUSHY DALE EARNHARDT STASCHE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. I FORGOT I HAD THIS ON. IT'S FOR A MOVIE PART. LET ME GET RID OF IT FOR YOU. THERE WE GO.
Jon: DID YOU GROW A MUSTACHE?
I WAS GOING FOR STANLEY TUCCI IN THE LOVELY BONES. YOU KNOW, SOPHISTICATED, FRIENDLY. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WAS TUCCI'S CHARACTER A --
I DON'T KNOW I DIDN'T SEE IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LET'S GET TO THE MATTER AT HAND HERE.
SURE, NASCAR.
Jon: YES.
THE PROBLEM IS THEY HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH THE HERITAGE. TODAY'S DRIVERS ARE ALL MILLIONAIRES. THE CARS THEY DRIVE IN ARE SPACE AGE SAFETYï¿½ï¿½ï¿½i CAGES WITH WHEEL AND THE TRACKS THEY DRIVE ON ARE  GOLD AND SPRAY PAINTED TO LOOK LIKE ASPHALT.
Jon: THAT SOUND AS MAZING. DO THEY HAVE THAT?
YOU WOULD THINK SO BUT IT'S BORING. NOT EVEN WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION. [LAUGHTER] COST COSTS $5 MILLION. THAT'S WHY NASCAR IS ECLIPSED BY DOWN AND DIRTY SPORTS LIKE CAGE  FIGHTING WHICH BRINGS ME TO THAT FIRST SOLUTION. LOSE THE BORING OVAL TRACK AND REPLACE IT WITH THE SHAPE PEOPLE LOVE THE OCTOBER GONE.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY THE INTEARAL ANGLE OF AN OCTOBER GONE IS 1358  DEGREES I DON'T KNOW HOW A DRIVER --
WAIT A MINUTE, HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE EXACT INTERIOR ANGLE AN OCTOBER GONE IS. HAND IT OVER, JON. A PROTRACTOR. I THOUGHT SO. [LAUGHTER] THAT'S MY JOB. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE THE SHAPE OF TRACK AND STEAL BACK VIEWERS FROM ULTIMATE FIGHTING.
OF COURSE NOT THAT'S WHY THEY MUST ENACT THE SECOND|ï¿½ SOLUTION NO MORE CARS.
Jon: A GIANT FOOT RACE?
MORE LIKE A FIST RACE. AS SOON AS THE FLAG GOES DOWN THE DRIVERS PUNCH EACH OTHER IN A CAGE.
Jon: I KNOW CAGE FIGHTING IS POPULAR WITHOUT CHANGING IT TO BE CAGE FIGHTING?
WHY? IT COULD BE BACK TO ITS ROOTS. STOCK CAR RACING STARTED OUT WITH BOOT LEGGERS OUTRUNNING THE POLICE DURING PROHIBITION.
Jon: RUGBY STARTED WITH PEOPLE FIGHTING OVER A HAM.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
Jon: HOW DOES NASCAR RECAPTURE THE EXCITEMENT AND DANGER OF THOSE RUM-RUNNING DAYS?
IT'S SIMPLE:  AFTER EACH RACE THE LOSER IS HANDCUFFED TO HIS  OWN BUMPER AND BEATEN TO DEATH BY A CORRUPT SOUTHERN SHERIFF.
Jon: YOUR SOLUTION IS TO FORCE THE DRIVERS TO SUFFER PAIN?
THAT'S NASCAR'S SOLUTION, WATCH.
THEY LOOSENED THE RULES THIS YEAR.
OFFICIALS WANT DRIVERS TO MIX IT UP, SAYING HAVE AT IT, BOYS  THE HISTORY IS BASED ON BANG RIG FENDER. THEY ARE GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO INTENTIONALLY WRECK PEOPLE.
ALLOW PEOPLE. THAT MEANS NOT HITTING PEOPLE IS AN OPTION. THAT WILL NEVER WORK.
Jon: THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND?
YOU WANT TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN MY SOLUTION AS AN EXCITING SPORT WHICH PEOPLE WANT  TO WATCH WITH NASCAR INSISTING ON CARS. ANSWER IS STARING US IN THE FACE:  MAKE THE A DEATH RACE. IN THE YEAR 2011 WHEN THE CRASHES ARE MANDATORY AND THE NAVIGATORS MUST HAVE GLASSES. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WAS 11 YEARS AGO.
Jon: IT'S 40 YEARS. IT WAS DAVID CARRADYNE IN DEATH RACE 2000.
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKED THAT MOVIE. A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED IT.
Jon: THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY HUGE BOMB.
AT LEAST ONE PERSON WATCHED IT. [LAUGHTER] A LOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STANLEY TUCCI F
