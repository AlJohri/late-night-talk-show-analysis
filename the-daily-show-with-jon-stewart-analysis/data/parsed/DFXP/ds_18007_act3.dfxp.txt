( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT N.B.A. LEGEND,  PLAYED FOR THE LOS ANGELES  LAKERS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE,  AND RECEIVED COUNTLESS HONORS FOR THAT TIME. PLEASE WELCOME MAGIC JOHNSON. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  HOW ARE YOU? I'M DOING GREAT.
Jon:  SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU HAD ME BACK THERE IN  TEARS THAT WAS SO FUNNY.
Jon:  THANK YOU, SIR. WE WORKED ON THAT FOR ALMOST AN  HOUR.
ESPECIALLY THE OBAMA  AFTERWARDS. YOU HAD ME ON THE FLOOR ON THAT  ONE.
Jon:  THANK YOU, SIR. I IMAGINE HE'S BEEN ON THERE AS  WELL, RECENTLY.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. HE BETTER GET UP IN A HURRY.
Jon:  YOU HAVE TO GET UP. LET ME GET RID OF THE BUSINESS  FIRST. THIS ORACLE, WHAT IS THIS A HOME  TEST, HIV? YOU'RE ENDORSING THIS?
YES, BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE HIV AND  AIDS FIGHT TODAY, WE WANT TO  TEST MORE PEOPLE, AND SO A LOT OF TIMES, PEOPLE THEN WANT TO GO  TO A DOCTOR OR TO AN HIV-AIDS  CLINIC TO GET AN HIV-AIDS TEST. NOW THEY'VE MADE IT POSSIBLE SO  YOU CAN DO IT IN YOUR OWN HOME.
Jon:  AN IN-HOME.
IN-HOME DISPL AND IT'S  SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND?
YES, BECAUSE DOCTORS WERE  ALREADY USING THIS. NOW IT'S AVAILABLE TO THE  PUBLIC.
Jon:  THERE'S A LOT OF,  OBVIOUSLY, RIVALRIES IN YOUR  BUSINESS. ARE YOU WORRIED LARRY BIRD WILL  NOW COME OUT WITH--  ( LAUGHTER )  HIV TEST, AND WE WILL TRY AND  BLOW YOUR TEST OUT OF THE WATER?
KNOWING LARRY, HE MIGHT.
Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I'M  SAYING.
SO I GOTTA WATCH OUT FOR HIM  AND MICHAEL. MAKE SURE --
YOU DON'T KNOW. MICHAEL WILL SAY, "I'VE ACTUALLY  GONE TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES  DISPEFTED THEM. I'VE BROUGHT THE TEST TO THEM,  MUCH BETTER THAN MAGIC."
HE CAN PUT IT IN HIS TENNIS  SHOES.
Jon:  THAT'S RIGHT.
I DEFINITELY HAVE TO WATCH  OUT FOR THAT.
Jon:  I THINK YOU'RE  ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S A GREAT THING THAT YOU'RE  DOING, AND IT'S VERY, VERY I  THINK ADMIRABLE THAT YOU  CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES AND HELPING PEOPLE AND ALL THAT,  EVEN GIVEN YOUR SUCCESS.
THANK YOU, I REALLY  APPRECIATE THAT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AFRICAN  AMERICANS AND LATINOS NOW, THEY  MAKE UP 50% OF THE NEW CASES OF  HIV, SO I HAVE TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S HURTING  MY COMMUNITY IN A BIG WAY.
Jon:  RIGHT, RIGHT. I  THINK THIS TEST NOW BEING AT  HOME WILL HELP I THINK GET AWAY  FROM THE STIGMA.
Jon:  ABSOLUTE, AND  INFORMATION IS A KEY AND  TREATMENT IS A KEY AND IT'S A  GREAT THING. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR RIVALS  TO BECOME FRIENDLY? YOU KNOW, I SEE NOW YOU AND  LARRY BIRD, YOU DO SHOWS  TOGETHER. THERE'S A BROADWAY SHOW, YOU  KNOW, RALPH FRANK AND BOAB  RICHARDSON, THE FAMOUS HOME RUN. IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO SORT  OF BECOME FRIENDS. ALI-FRAZIER NEVER QUITE PULLED  THE TRICK. THESE GREAT RIVALRIES. WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THOSE  RELATIONSHIPS? IS IT RESPECT? IS THERE ANTAGONISM THAT KEEPS  PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO PUT  THEIR SPORTS DERPSES ASIDE. WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN?
THE REASON YOU HATE THE OTHER  GUY IS BECAUSE HE'S SO GOOD AND  YOU DO RESPECT HIM.
Jon:  RIGHT.
SO-- AND YOU KNOW HE CAN KICK  YOUR BUTT AT ANY TIME.
Jon:  RIGHT. I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT A LARGE  PART OF THE WORLD.
YES, YES. ( LAUGHTER ). BOY, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
Jon:  THANK YOU  ( APPLAUSE )  WALKA MILE IN MY SHOES.
EXACTLY. I LIKE THAT.
Jon:  THANK YOU, I  APPRECIATE THAT.
I THINK THAT FOR LARRY AND I,  IT WAS-- I TRULY RESPECTED THE  GUY. HEAP KEPT ME UP, AND I HAD  SLEEPLESS NIGHTS BECAUSE I KNEW  IF WE MADE ENOUGH MISTAKES, THAT  THE CELTICS AND LARRY BIRD COULD BEAT US. ONCE WE DID A COMEECIAL.
Jon:  THIS WAS IN INDIAN. WAS IT A NIKE COMMERCE?
IT WAS A CONVERSE COMMERCIAL.
Jon:  CONVERSE  COMMERCIAL.
AND WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER  AWAY FROM THE BASKETBALL COURT. HE TOOK ME UP TO HIS HOUSE. HIS MOTHER MADE LURN. HIS MOTHER FELL IN LOVE WITH ME. I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER. IT WAS A --
WERE YOU NERVOUS, SHE SLIDES  YOU A PLATE OF FOOD...?
AND I'M WATCH GLG DID YOU  SAY, "SOMEBODY GET IN HERE AND  TASTE THIS."  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING?
EXACTLY, EXACTLY. I DID WANT TO PLAY THE NEXT  SEASON.
Jon:  SURE.
SO IT WAS A TRIP BECAUSE WE  FINALLY START TALKING ABOUT  ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT BASKETBALL. AND THAT HELPED US KNOW EACH  OTHER AS MEN. NOT AS MAGIC AND LARRY GOING  HEAD TO HEAD AND BATTLING EACH  OTHER. AND AFTERWARDS, IT MADE IT  EASIER FOR US TO BE FRIENDS.
Jon:  WHAT REPLACES --  YOU KNOW, THAT IDEA OF  COMPETITION, AND WHEN YOU'RE--  FACE FACTS -- THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT SOMETHING, WHICH WAS  BASKETBALL, AND YOU AND LARRY  AND YOU HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE  COMPETITION, AND THEN THAT ENDS. YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING TO  REPLACE THAT FEELING? IS THAT BUSINESS? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU DO  THAT STILL GIVES YOU THAT JUICE,  OR IS IT THAT JUICE IS MAYBE NOT  AS IMPORTANT TO YOU AS IT WAS?
TO YOUR LAST POINT, IT'S NOT  AS IMPORTANT, AND YOU'LL NEVER  FIND IT.
Jon:  YEAH.
THERE'S NOTHING THAT DROVE ME  MORE THAN KICKING LARRY'S BUTT. ( LAUGHTER ). I MEAN, REALLY.
Jon:  I GET IT. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE-- I THINK  IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE BEING THE  BEST IN THE WORLD AT SOMETHING. AND TO HAVE SOMEBODY THERE  THJING YOU AND BOTH OF YOU  PUSHING EACH OTHER. IT REALLY WAS AN AMAZING TIME.
MICHAEL MISSED THAT. YOU KNOW, LARRY AND I WERE ON  OUR DOWN YEARS. WE WERE ACTUALLY GOING OUT WHEN  MICHAEL AND THE BULLS GOT GREAT. AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY TO GO  HEAD TO HEAD OR WORRY ABOUT OR  WAS SCARED OF BECAUSE THE BULLS  WERE JUST BETTER THAN EVERYBODY  ELSE. SO THE BLESSING FOR LARRY AND I  AND THE LAKE EXPERTS CELTICS, WE  HAD EACH OTHER. LARRY PUSHED ME TO BE GREAT. AND I HOPE I PUSHED HIM TO BE  GREAT. AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SO GREAT. AND THEN HUEVERYBODY ELSE, NOT  JUST LARRY. KAREEM, AND ROBERT PARISH, KEVIN  McKALE AND JAMES WORTHY. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. AND THAT'S WHAT MADE THAT WHOLE  RIVALRY SO GREAT.
Jon:  I GUESS THE REAL  MESSAGE TONIGHT FROM MAGIC  JOHNSON IS FIND SOMEBODY TO  HATE. ( LAUGHTER ). ( APPLAUSE )  THE GREAT MAGIC JOHNSON. SO NICE HAVE YOU.
