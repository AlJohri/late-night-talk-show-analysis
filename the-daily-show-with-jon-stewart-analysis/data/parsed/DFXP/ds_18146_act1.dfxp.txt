FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART! [ APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: HEY, EVERYBODY!   WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY  NAME IS JON STEWART, VIA A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. MARIO LIVIO.
ABOUT GREAT SCIENTIFIC  ERRORS, LIKE MONKEY POX.
LIKE SO MANY NIGHTS BEFORE  WITH THE STRONG POSSIBILITY OF A  NEBULOUSLY DEFINED TARGETISH  BOMBING. DESIGNED TO BRING PEACE AND  STABILITY TO THE BOMB EES.
IT IS NOT DEJA VU OR  GROUNDHOG DAY, IT IS GROUNDHOG  DEJA CLUSTER (BLEEP).
OBAMA LAID OUT THE GOALS FOR  BOMBING SYRIA WHICH ULTIMATELY  ARE REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.
THE GOAL IS TO NEGOTIATE A  SOLUTION WHICH RESULTS IN THE  DEPARTURE OF BA AND THE FREE CHOICE OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE FOR  THEIR FUTURE.
Stewart: ASSAD LEAVES  WILLINGLY, DEMOCRATIC SYRIA IS  STABLE AND PEACEFUL, THOUSANDS OF LIVES ARE SAVED AND A AND  THEY GET MARRIED AND LIVE  HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH UNICORNS AND RAINBOWS!
IT SOUNDS SIMPLE BUT I AM  SURE IT IS AN ARDUOUS TASK,  COMPLEX TASK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WERE LISTENING TO  OUR COMMITTEE CHAIR THERE,  MR. CHAIR, OUR SECRETARY OF STATE RIGHTFULLY AGONIZED OVER  FOR HOURS AND HOURS.
JOHN MCCAIN FINDING WAYS TO  PASS THE TIME DURING THAT SENATE  FOREIGN RELATIONS HEARING COMMITTEE ON SYRIA, THAT IS  SENATOR MCCAIN ON HIS PHONE  PLAYING POKER. [ APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: HEY, MAN, IS THIS  POSSIBLE GLOBAL CONFLAGRATION  INTERRUPTING YOUR VIDEO POKER TIME?  WELL, YOU HAVE BEEN  TALKING HAWKISH ISSUE FOR A YEAR  AND THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SHINE AND THIS YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED  BECAUSE YOU ARE ABOUT TO BEAT  STASH MAN 42?  YOU KNOW WHAT, SENATOR?  GO. RASCAL SCOOTER AND A BUCKET OF  QUARTERS AND PLAY ALL THE VIDEO  OWE POKER YOU WANT, $9.99 PRIME RIB, GO TO THE, GO TO AN ACTUAL  CASINO AND PRETEND LIKE YOU  ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD.  DO HOW ABOUT  THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: I TELL YOU WHAT IT  IS OBAMA SHOULD HAVE DONE!
PLAY THAT POKER IN MY BRAIN. HOW IS MCCAIN GOING TO EXPLAIN  THIS ONE?
YOU WERE CAUGHT TODAY, YOU  KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT  SENATOR.
THERE YOU ARE. THERE IS THE PICTURE.
Stewart: HEAVE HE, HE, HE. AH. HA, HA!  YOU GOT ME!  I'M  TERRIBLE!  HA, HA!  THAT IS A  GREAT SHOT OF MCCAIN, BY THE  WAY. CAN WE GET A GIP OF THAT BAD  BOY. I'M SORRY, SENATOR, I  INTERRUPTED YOU.
THE WORST THING ABOUT IT IS  I  LOST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN  THIS GAME.
YOU WHAT?
I LOST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.
Stewart: YOU KNOW, IF THERE  IS ONE THING I HAVE LEARNED IN  MY CAREER IT IS THIS. THE JOKE ALWAYS LANDS BETTER IF  YOU REPEAT IT A SECOND TIME. YOU KNOW, LIKE A LOOP. MAN, IT SEEMS LIKE NO A MATTER  WHAT WE DO IN THE MIDDLE EAST IT  IS LIKE WE ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF  IT. IT IS LIKE WE WRITE THE SCRIPT  IN AMERICA AND JUST HEAD TO THE  MIDDLE EAST, SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME THERE AND QUITE A BIT OF  MONEY AND COME BACK AND FINALLY  GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU SHOT AND IT TURNS OUT IT IS  (BLEEP) SUCKS, THREE MONTHS AND  FLIES OVER THE MIDDLE EAST AND IT IS ALL BULL (BLEEP). WHO HOW, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO  WITH THIS? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE ARE  GOING TO SIT THROUGH A THREE  HOUR MOVING ABOUT THREE GUYS SITTING IN A PRISON CELL, I AM  NOT GOING BACK THERE, YOU HEAR  ME!  STILL PULLING PIECES OF THAT OUT OF MY ASS.
ANYWAY, THAT IS SYRIA. JUST A GENERAL ANALOGY. WE TRIED EVERYTHING. SANCTIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,  CRUISE, EXPLICIT AND NOT AS  EXPLICIT. WE EVEN TRIED IGNORING THE  REGION AND PRETENDING THE  ATROCITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH US.
WE EVEN ATTEMPTED DIALOGUE. EVERY EIGHT YEARS OR SO.
EVERY EIGHT YEARS OR SO. AH, THERE WE GO. I KNEW THAT WAS COMING. IT IS LIKE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE A  SUPERPOWER WE HAVEN'T FIGURED  OUT YET WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE  SUPERPOWERS. BUT WE JUST KEEP JUMPING OUT OF  THE BUILDING THINKING WE ARE  GOING TO FLY!  YOU COME OUT OF THE PHONE BOOTH AND TEAR YOUR  SUIT OFF AND YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU  ARE (BLEEP) CLARK KENT. THERE IS NOTHING THERE AFTER  ALL!  ANY TIME WE JUST WENT BACK  TO WHERE A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS  STARTED. THE ORIGINAL SIN, THE BRITISH  MAN 100 YEARS AGO DRAWING A MAP  OF A PLACE HE NEVER HAD BEEN TO FILLED WITH PEOPLE HE NEVER MET,  FORMING NEW COUNTRIES WITH NO  ATTENTION PAID TO ETHNIC RACE OR  TENSIONS.
I GIVE YOU SIR MAPS A,  ARCHIBALD MAPS A LOT III.
NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR!
ABSOLUTE PLEASURE TO BE HERE,  JON!  NOW WHAT IS ALL THE BOTHER  ABOUT.
IT IS ACTUALLY AMOUNT THE  MIDDLE EAST, ARCHIBALD.
GHASTLY PLACE, HAVEN'T BEEN  THERE, DON'T WANT TO. INDIA, THAT IS A PLAYING WORTH  SUBJUGATING.
Stewart: THE BORDER THAT  YOU DREW BACK AFTER WORLD WAR 1.
YEP.
Stewart: WELL, THEY HAVE  PROVEN TO BE A LITTLE UNSTABLE  AND SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL.
REALLY?  NOT A PROBLEM. WE WILL JUST DRAW THEM AGAIN. IN NOT A PROBLEM. YES. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
Stewart: THAT'S A PROBLEM. YOU ARE A LITTLE CAVALIER ABOUT  THIS.
THIS TIME I WILL TAKE CARE. A QUICK SCRIBBLE BEFORE YOU KNOW  IT, IT IS GIN O'CLOCK, LET'S  TAKE A LOOK. YEP, YEP, I SEE YOUR PROBLEM  RIGHT HERE. THE LINES ARE TOO SQUIGGLY.
AS MY FATHER ONCE TOLD ME  WHEN BORDERS GET SQUIGGLY,  PEOPLE GET SQUIGGLY, WHAT YOU WANT IS A NICE STRAIGHT LINE,  JON, STRAIGHT AS YOU, CAN LIKE  THAT. LOVELY. LOVELY.
Stewart: WHAT YOU HAVE DONE  THOUGH YOU HAVE TAKEN SOME LAND  FROM TURKEY AND NOW A KURDISH POPULATION IN A DISPUTED ZONE.
THAT IS A WHO LIVING IN A  WHERE, JON?  THIS IS  IMPERIALISM, BOY, FIRST RULE IS DON'T OVER THINK IT, SECOND  RULE, DON'T THINK AT ALL!  CHECK  YOUR BRAIN AT THE DOOR WITH YOUR BRAWLEY, THEY WILL LEARN TO LIVE  WITH IT AND IF NOT WHO REALLY  CARES. SEE HOW EASY THIS IS, PUSH POSH,  PUT IN THE STRAIGHT, LOVELY AND  TAKE OUT THE JIGGLES, THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO AND WE ARE  DONE, TIME FOR A NAUGHTY SHERRY  BECAUSE IF I KNOW ARABS, JON, AND BELIEVE ME, I DO NOT -- THEY  LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN ALCOHOL  AFTER A GOOD WESTERN  INTERVENTION.
Stewart: WHAT YOU ARE DOING  THERE, SEE THAT IS TECHNICALLY  IRAN IS NOT ARAB. THEY ARE PERSIAN.
WHAT?  PERSIAN?
Stewart: YES.
YOU ARE SAYING THEY ARE CATS?
Stewart: NO, I AM NOT.
CATS AND RUSSIAN LIVING SIDE  BY SIDE. OH, IT WILL NEVER WORK, JON!   THEY ARE NATURAL ENEMIES.
Stewart: I UNDERSTAND THAT. I KNOW THAT CATS AND RUSSIAN ARE  NATURAL -- LOOK, THAT IS NOT  WHAT PERSIANS -- WHY DIDN'T YOU TOUCH SAUDI ARABIA, BY THE WAY.
WHY TOUCH SAUDI ARABIA,  JONATHAN?  THEY ARE A GOOD  DECENT OIL PRODUCING PEOPLE!
Stewart: I DON'T THINK THIS  IS GOING TO WORK OUT.
LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING THE  ARABS RESPECT, JON, MORE THAN A  STRONG, STEADY WHITE HAND DRAWING ARBITRARY LINES TO  THEIR, TO, AGAINST THEIR  RIDICULOUS TRIBAL ALLEGIANCES.
Stewart: THAT SEEMS A BUILT  RACIST.
YOU ARE CALLING ME A WHAT?
Stewart: THAT IS A BIT  RACIST. > BA, BA, BA, STEADY THAT SHIP!   TO CALL ME RACIST WOULD BE TO  IMPLY I CARED ENOUGH TO HATE  THEM. OH, OR, OR WITH A INTERESTING  MUST HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING  ABOUT THEM TO DISLIKE. THAT'S IT.
Stewart: THAT IS EXACTLY  THE KIND OF MINDLESS IMPERIALISM  THAT GOT US INTO THIS SITUATION. YOUR CASUAL IGNORANCE HAS DOOMED  THE REGION TO EXIST IN A  PERPETUAL STATE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT  NOW?
I AM PLAYING POKER.
Stewart: WAIT!  WHY?  WHY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Stewart: WHY?
BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING ME,  JON. AND THIS IS WHAT REAL GENTLEMEN  DO. THEY PLAY POKER ON THEIR IPHONES  WHENEVER THEY BECOME  INEXPLICABLY BORED BY SOMETHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I BID YOU GOOD DAY, SIR.
Stewart: SIR ARCHIBALD --
I BID YOU GOOD DAY!
Stewart: SIR
