WELCOME BACK. WE NOW REJOIN SAMANTHA BEE'S  PRESS, PART TWO OF ZERO DARK  900,000.
IN MY SEARCH FOR EUGENE  MANNINGS MISSING VA CLAIM  FORM I KEPT GETTING  STONEWALLED. BUT JUST WHEN I WAS AT MY  DARKEST, A BREAK. MY TEAM HAD CAPTURED AN  ENEMY COMBATANT, VA  SYMPATHIZER AND AUTHOR CAMEA  WILLIAMS.
WE'RE TRYING TO LOCATE A  MEDICAL CLAIM FORM FILED BY  ARMY VETERAN EUGENE MANNING OVER 300 DAYS AGO. WHERE IS THE CLAIM?
I REALLY DON'T --
IN THE END EVERYBODY  BREAKS.
I THINK THEY'RE TRYING  REALLY HARD TO DO A BETTER  JOB.
OKAY, WILLIAMS, YOU WANT  TO PLAY IT THAT WAY.
I'M ABOUT TO PERPETRATE  SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF  TORTURE ON THEIR ASS. LOOK LIKES SOMEBODY WANTS TO  GET CHEESE BOARDED.
HERE YOU GO, YOU'RE GOING  TO NEED THIS FOR SPREADING.
YOU HEAR THAT. THAT IS THE VA AUTOMATED  TELEPHONE SYSTEM. ENJOY.
I HOPE YOU LIKE LONG FORM  IMPROV.
HEY, HEY, HOW ARE YOU  DOING.
WE DO AN 90 MINUTE  IMPROVISED LONG FORM SITCOM.
THEY CAN DO THIS ALL DAY  LONG. YOU JUST TRY CHOKING DOWN  THAT BOARD FULL OF CHEESE  WITHOUT ANY FIBER.
OH I FORGOT MY WIFE ONLY  SPEAKS SPANISH.
DON'T YOU TURN EYES AWAY  FROM THIS ABOMINATION.
PLEASE ENTER YOUR SOCIAL  SECURITY NUMBER.
SHE'S ENJOYING IT. PLAY IT BACK, REMOVE THE  CHEESE.
IT TOOK ENTIRE MINUTES  BUT SHE FINALLY CRACKED. WHERE IS THE CLAIM?
YOU HAVE ASKED THE VA?
THAT'S IT. BUT WHICH LOCATION.
IT WOULD BE IN THE  MANHATTAN, IN THE NEW YORK  REGIONAL OFFICE.
OH MY GOD. IT'S BEEN UNDER OUR NOSES  THE ENTIRE TIME? JUST MILES FROM THE AMERICAN  EQUIVALENT OF WEST POINT. WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS WEST  POINT. THIS IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF  WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE  AT THE VA BUILDING.
HOW MUCH PAPER IS THAT?
ROUGHLY A COUPLE OF  MILLION LOST DOCUMENTS.
IS THE MEDICAL CLAIMING  THE VA --
100 PERCENT IT'S THERE.
OH PIE GOD, IS THAT A  MINICLIPBOARD.
YES, A MININOTEPAD.
MY DAUGHTER WOULD LOVE  THIS.
JUST BRING ME THE [BLEEP] CLAIM FORM.
GOGELS DOWN.
GOGELS DOWN.
GOGELS UP, GOGELS UP.
THAT DOES NOTHING FOR US.
YOU GOT AN ORGANIC --
ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T TAKE  IT, I'M GOING IN.
REALLY? BY YOURSELF.
YEAH, I GOT IT.
NOW THAT'S AN-- SEE?
ALL RIGHT.
THE GROOVE ON THERE.
I GOT THE FORM. LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF  HERE.
YOU GOT IT, WE GOT IT!
OH PIE GOD.
YEAH.
WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THIS? YOU JUST BROUGHT A BUNCH OF  BLANK CLAIMS FROM THE VA  WAITING ROOM. ARE YOU SIMPLE? [BLEEP] AWAY FROM ME.
WOW, SHE'S REALLY MAD.
WE DIDN'T GET THE CLAIM  FORM BUT WE'RE NEVER GOING  TO STOP. FOR EUGENE, FOR ALL THE  SOLDIERS, THIS DOESN'T END  HERE.
PRESS TWO FOR INFORMATION  ABOUT VA BENEFITS, PRESS  THREE. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT FOR  CLAIM SPECIFIC  INFORMATION --
SAMANTHA BEE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
