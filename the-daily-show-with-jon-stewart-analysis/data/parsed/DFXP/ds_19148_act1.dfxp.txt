FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. ADAM LEVINE OF MAROON 5, GONNA BE RIGHT HERE. BUT FIRST, THE 2014 MID-TERM ELECTIONS, OH THEY'RE COMING UP FAST. AND ALTHOUGH CONGRESS IS VIEWED SLIGHTLY LESS FAVORABLY THAN THAT MOMENT YOU SMELL VOMIT, YOU KNOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO  VOMIT BUT YOU HAVE NOT YET VOMITED. ALMOST EVERY INCUMBENT IS STILL GONNA WIN THEIR RACE, ESPECIALLY IN THE HOUSE, WHICH MEANS ALL EYES ARE IN THE SENATE. WILL THE DEMOCRATS RETAIN CONTROL? [AUDIENCE MEMBER SCREAMS] [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE RHETORICAL QUESTION. THEY FEEL, PERHAPS SO COMFORTABLE THEY FEEL THEY'RE AT HOME, THEY CAN JUST YELL OUT, NOT REALIZING THIS TIME I CAN HEAR THEM. WILL THE DEMOCRATS WIN CONTROL. WE DON'T KNOW. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014: IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT BASE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF REPUBLICANS RECAPTURE THE SENATE? THE STAKES ARE STUNNING.
IF THE PRESIDENT LOSES THE SENATE, HE WILL HAVE BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS WORKING TO STOP HIM.
GRIDLOCK WILL BE EPIDEMIC.
Jon: OH, NO, GRID LOCK WILL BE EPIDEMIC IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S LIKE SAYING THE INTERNET WILL BEEN INUNDATED WITH PORN. NOW TRADITIONALLY THE MID-TERMS FUNCTION AS A REFERENDUM ONTHE PRESIDENT. SO HOW IS THE PRESIDENT'S LACK OF POPULARITY AFFECTING THE RACE?
THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES ARE SIMPLY WRONG.
MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S CLEAR, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS AFFECTS KENTUCKY.
I OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION. NO ONE FROM NEW YORK OR WASHINGTON TELLS ME WHAT TO DO.
I'LL MAKE SURE PRESIDENT OBAMA GETS THE MESSAGE. [GUNFIRE] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: WELL, I HAD NO IDEA THE WHITE HOUSE HAD SUCH AN ACCESSIBLE, UH, ACME COMPANY-LIKE OFF SWITCH. SEEMS LIKE A WEAKNESS IN OUR NATION'S ELECTRICAL GRID, NOT TO MENTION AN INCONVENIENCE FOR THE PRESIDENT. I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU JUST SITTING AROUND THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW, TRYING THE READ SOMETHING AND THEN, DOH! YOU KNOW, THESE REPUBLICAN ATTACK ADS ARE JUST GETTING SILLIER AND -- I'M BEING TOLD THE CANDIDATES IN THOSE ADS ARE DEMOCRATS. BUT EVEN THOUGH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE THROWING THE PRESIDENT SHADE, THAT ISN'T STOPPING HIM FROM WORKING ON THEIR BEHALF.
IN COLORADO PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOWED UP FOR A FUND-RAISING EVENT LAST WEEK. A FUND-RAISING EVENT FOR DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK UDALL. WELL, MARK UDALL WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
Jon: OH, THAT STINGS A BIT, BUT IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SHAME OBAMA BY NOT WANTING TO BE SEEN WITH HIM IN PUBLIC, THE MAN HAS TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS. [LAUGHTER] I THINK HE'S FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF BEING SHUNNED. DAD, CAN YOU NOT PRESIDENT JUST ONE TIME IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS. JUST PLEASE. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S A PITCH PERFECT IMPRESSION.
AMONG THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING FROM OBAMA, KENTUCKY SENATE CANDIDATE ALLISON GRIMES UP AGAINST FIVE TERM SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL. McCONNELL HAS A LOT OF STRIKES AGAINST HIM. HE'S THE FACE OF REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTIONISM, A STALWART PROTECTOR OF BIG BUSINESS AND HE SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE THIS, "I SURE WOULD LIKE... I SURE WOULD LIKE TO BE ELECTED FOR MY SIXTH TERM." [LAUGHTER] HOLD ON! "YEP." YEP, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW HE SOUNDS. BUT GRIMES, GRIMES ISN'T WITHOUT SOME SKELETONS IN HER CLOSET.
GRIMES' FATHER HAS BECOME AN ISSUE, TOO. HE OWNS HUGH JASS BURGERS IN LEXINGTON.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. HUGH JASS BURGERS, A KENTUCKY STAPLE JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM ANOTHER FAMOUS KENTUCKY ESTABLISHMENT, E. NORMA'S WEINERS. THAT ONE'S NOT REAL. SO HER FATHER OWNS A WAGGISHLY PUNNED ESTABLISHMENT. HOW BAD CAN THAT BE?
THE MENU INCLUDES ABBY'S HUGH JASS, NAME AFTER HIS DAUGHTER ABIGAIL, AND CHARLOTTE'S RACK, A REFERENCE TO BARBECUE AND HIS WIFE.
Jon: MY GODDAUGHTER'S TATER TITS, AUNT SOPHIE'S CRUSTY MUFFIN. I HATE MY FAMILY. [LAUGHTER] SO ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DISREPUTABLE ORGANIZATION THAT FLAUNTS ITS CONTEMPT FOR WOMEN, AND THE OTHER HAS A DAD THAT OWNS HUGH JASS BURGERS. BOOM! HASHTAG YES ALL BURGERS. WHAT IF YOUR OPPONENT'S DAD DOESN'T OWN A HILARIOUSLY NAMED FAST FOOD JOINT? YOU COULD GO WITH ARKANSAS SENTATOR MARK PRYOR'S STRATEGY AGAINST HIS OPPONENT TOM COTTON.
TOM COTTON VOTED AGAINST PREPARING AMERICA FOR PANDEMICS LIKE EBOLA.
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO VOTE AGAINST CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS.
MY OPPONENT IS PRO EBOLA AND ANTI-BABY. WELL, THAT CERTAINLY HAS TO BE THE MOST PREJORTIVE AND ACCUSATORY AD IN THE SENATE RACES, YOU WOULD THINK. IF YOU DIDN'T LIVE IN ALASKA.
ALASKA TURNED UGLY. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK BEGICH RELEASED THIS AD CRITICIZING REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER DAN SULLIVAN.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CRIME SCENE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG DAN SULLIVAN LIVED IN ALASKA, BUT I KNOW WHAT HE DID AS ATTORNEY GENERAL. HE LET A LOT OF SEX OFFENDERS GET OFF OF LIGHT SENTENCES. ONE OF THEM GOT OUT OF PRISON, IS NOW CHARGED WITH BREAKING INTO THAT APARTMENT BUILDING, MURDERED A SENIOR COUPLE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOLY CRAP, MARK BEGICH'S OPPONENT DAN SULLIVAN IS LIKE A ONE-MAN, LAW AND ORDER S.U.V. PLOT GENERATOR. SVU, I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NOT S.U.V. S.U.V. WOULD BE JUST A GUY IN A TRUCK. [LAUGHTER] YOU TRY AND READ. HOW CAN A GUY LIKE THAT EVEN DARE TO RUN UNLESS, OF COURSE, THERE'S SOME MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DUE TO THE TIME CONSTRAINTS OF THAT CAMPAIGN AD WAS NOT INCLUDED THAT MAY SHED SOME EXONERATING LIGHT ON SULLIVAN.
A CLERICAL ERROR WAS TO BLAME FOR THE MURDER SUSPECT'S EARLY RELEASE BEFORE SULLIVAN TOOK OFFICE.
OH, WELL THEN I GUESS IT APPEARS SULLIVAN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT I GUESS, WELL THAT'S FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. WHAT'S SULLIVAN'S TAKE ON THE RACE?
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF NEGATIVE ADS ARE FLOODING INTO ALASKA, PAID FOR BY WASHINGTON SPECIAL INTERESTS. PRETTY SOON YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO THIS TO YOUR TV. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OR YOU COULD TURN IT OFF. [LAUGHTER] BUT THAT'S YOUR CHOICE, ALASKA. YOU CAN VOTE FOR A GUY WHO LIES IN HIS CAMPAIGN ADS OR HIS OPPONENT, THE WEIRD GUY DOWN AT THE EDGE OF TOWN WHO SHOOTS HIS APPLIANCES WHEN THEY DISPLEASE HIM. TOASTER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
