(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW THAT WE ARE PULLING OUT OF IRAQ WE CAN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS HERE AT HOME. HIGH ENERGY COSTS, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT?
I THINK WE CAN CREATE A NEW GREEN ECONOMY.
Jon: THAT SOUNDS AWESOME. AND MINTY. WE INVEST IN THE GRID AND IN 50 YEARS WE'RE LOOKING AT SOLAR MOON HOUSES MADE OF  RECYCLED HELIUM MOLECULES AND PANDA HAIR. TO THE FUTURE.
WE'RE GOING TO WEATHERORTER HOMES.
WE WEATHERORTER HOMES. WEATHERORTER HOMES. THEY'RE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT.
Jon: THAT IS SOMETHING TOO. THEY'RE VERY IMMATURE. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT... I THINK... TALKING ABOUT SEALING WINDOWS. THAT'S NOT BETTER. I DON'T, I DON'T. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  WHY WOULD YOU NEED THREE TO  KEEP SOMETHING WARM? THERE. THERE WE GO. AS WE'VE BEEN TOLD, WEATHERIZATION IS A MODEST ACHIEVABLE PROGRAM THAT WILL CUT OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN  OIL AND PUT MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS RIGHT AWAY.
WE'RE PUTTING GRANTS TO STATE TO HELP WEATHER-IZE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES.
Jon: ARE YOU NUTS? IT'S LIKE GIVING YOUR TEENAGE KIDS THE $1,000 AND SAYING WE'RE GOING AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND. WEATHER-IZE THE HOUSE WHILE WE'RE GONE. YOU'LL COME HOME TO THE DOG WEARING YOUR WIFE'S WEDDING DRESS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE IS STATES DON'T SCREW THIS THING UP.
I'M GOING TO BE A BIT OF A PAIN IN THE NECK. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD AS MANY PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.
Jon: JOE!
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MONEY HERE. THE NEED FOR US TO FOM THE MONEY. I DON'T WANT TO GET A PHONE CALL SAYING, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE AND NOTHING  HAS HAPPENED FOR THREE WEEKS. WE MAY SOMETIMES NOT HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY ONCE WE CUT THE CHECK TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE MORAL DISAPROBATION OF THIS OFFICE WILL BE USED.
Jon: YOU HAVE FOSSIL FUEL RESIDUE ON YOUR... IT'S EITHER ASH WEDNESDAY OR BIDEN HAS  BEEN MAKING SMORZ WITH HIS LIGHTER AGAIN. ANYWAY THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE STATES IN LINE. THE MORAL DISAPROBATION OF JOE BIDEN. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT ENTRENCHED STATE AND FEDERAL BUREAUCRACIES? WELL, IN BIDEN'S HOME STATE OF DELAWARE OFFICIALS HAD TO SUSPEND THE WEATHERIZATION  PROGRAM IN MAY 2010 DUE TO GROSS MISMANAGEMENT AND POTENTIAL FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. (SIGHING) JOE BIDEN COULDN'T CONTROL FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY IN HIS OWN STATE. A THING SO SMALL YOU COULD ACTUALLY WEATHER-IZE IT. BUT MAYBE AFTER FOUR DECADES DELAWARE IS SIMPLY IMMUNE TO JOE BIDEN'S CRANKYNESS SO HOW  IS A $5 BILLION-PLUS DOLLARS WE SPENT ON WEATHERIZATION WORK OUT FOR US?
THE GOAL OF THE 41-STATE PROGRAM IS 170,000 RETROFITSAGE 0,000 JOBS  CREATED IN SEATTLE WHICH GOT A $20 MILLION GRANT ONE YEAR INTO THE PROGRAM ONLY THREE  HOMES HAVE HAD UPGRADES AND 14 JOBS CREATED.
Jon: 14 JOBS TO WEATHER-IZE THREE HOMES? ARE YOU PLUGGING THE UNEMPLOYED INTO THE DRAFT? COME ON, MAN. THREE HOMES IN A YEAR. HAVE YOU BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN? IN AFGHANISTAN IN THE FACE OF WEEKS WE BUILT AN ENTIRE CITY IN A BARREN DESERT AND  EQUIPPED IT WITH WATER FILTRATION, PIZZA HUTS, STARBUCKS. WE DID IT WHILE PEOPLE WERE SHOOTING (BEEP) ROCKETS AT US. YOU'RE TELLING ME WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WEATHER-IZE SEATTLE BUNK LOWS? WE HAVE NOTHING FOR $5 BILLION.
THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT SAYS 14% OF THE PROJECTS FAILED TO MEET SAFETY OR QUALITY STANDARDS. THEY FOUND SOME OF THE FURNISH ACES SPEWED CARBON MONOXIDE. WATER HEATERS ON THE VERGE OF EXPLODING. CONTRACTORS NOT FAMILIAR WITH WEATHERIZATION SPEWING ASBESTOS THROUGHOUT THE HOME.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? IF AS A COUNTRY WE CAN'T EVEN HANDLE WEATHER-IZING OUR HOUSES, WE ARE DONE. WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST SAW A HOLE IN THE ROOF AND HUDDLE AROUND A TIRE FIRE FOR WARMTH. MR. PRESIDENT, THE GREEN ENERGY IS YOUR IDEA. DON'T JUST THROW A LOT OF TAX PAYOR MONEY IN THERE AND WALK AWAY. WHEN YOU DECIDED TO KILL BIN LADEN, DID YOU SAY HERE GIVE THIS MONEY TO HALEY BARBOUR TO  HEAD UP A PROGRAM. GO DOWN TO THE SITUATION ROOM, PICK UP THE SCRAMBLE LINE AND CALL IN SEALANT TEAM 6. GET IT DONE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
