(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: OH, WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF LOUISIANA, HE IS NOW A  REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY, PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM BUDDY ROEMER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SIR, NICE TO SEE YOU. THANKS FOR COMING.
WHERE IS NO, THANK YOU. (APPLAUSE).
Jon: HOW ARE YOU SNOWED.
I'M DOING WELL, JON. A LITTLE WET BUT I'M WELL.
Jon: TERRIBLE WEATHER THESE DAYS. TERRIBLE WEATHER. BUDDY ROEMER, TELL ME, YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THERE IS A DEBATE THAT IS APPENING OF REPUBLICANH CANDIDATES AT THE REAGAN MUSEUM AND LIBRARY...
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
Jon: FAMILY RESORT. (LAUGHTER) AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN INVITED.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS QUESTION.
Jon: I WILL ABSOLUTELY BE SERIOUS. SIR, WHY WILL THEY NOT INVITE YOU TO THIS DEBATE?
THEY HAVE SOME RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT INCLUDE A NATIONAL POLL THAT HAS YOU AT 4%  OR HIGHER. I'VE BEEN OUT OF POLITICS FOR 16 YEARS, I STARTED RUNNING FOUR  WEEKS AGO, I'M NOT A BIG-FUNDED BIG-CHECK CANDIDATE, I HAVE A DIFFERENT STYLE ABOUT ME. I'M JUST NOW APPEARING IN THE POLLS. I WAS AT A SMOOTH 1% LAST WEEK. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: SO YOU'RE ALREADY BEATING RICK SANTORUM. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) WHAT... THE PERCENTAGE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE AT TO BE IN THE... TO  QUALIFY FOR THE DEBATE IS WHAT?
IN THIS POLL IT'S 4%... IN THIS DEBATE IT'S 4%.
Jon: WHO SETS THE PERCENTAGE?
I'M NOT SURE. IT'S DELIBERATELY VAGUE, YOU KNOW? WE'VE TRIED TO GET IN EVERY DEBATE. I'D LOVE A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT JOBS OR MONEY IN POLITICS, MY ISSUES. AND YET WE TALK TO THE SPONSOR AND THEY SAY "IT'S NOT ME. IT'S CNN. IT'S COMEDY CENTRAL. IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE." (LAUGHTER) WHOEVER'S HOLDING THESE DEBATES. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I HAD NO IDEA WE HAD THAT MUCH SWAY.
WHERE IS I MADE THAT UP.
Jon: IF IT WERE COMEDY CENTRAL IN CHARGE IT WOULD JUST BE DONALD TRUMP ALONE FOR LIKE  AN HOUR AND A HALF. (LAUGHTER) THERE MUST BE... I MEAN HUNTSMAN AND SANTORUM, I CAN'T IMAGINE  THEY'RE AT 4% NATIONALLY.
THEY WERE ONE POLL AT ONE TIME. (LAUGHTER) I THINK THEY HAVE DIMINISHD FROM THERE.
Jon: NOW I UNDERSTAND, LOOK, THEY HAVE TO SET SOME PARAMETERS, THEY CAN'T JUST LET ANYBODY... BUT YOU ARE NOT A  FRINGE LUNATIC. YOU ARE... YOU ARE THE GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA, YOU WERE A CONGRESSMAN, YOU'RE... CLEARLY  CAN DRESS YOURSELF. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE YOU...
WELL, LET'S KEEP THE RECORD STRAIGHT, JON. IT'S MY WIFE WHO DRESSES ME. I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: IS IT A SENSE-- ESPECIALLY EARLY ON, WE'RE A YEAR AND THREE MONTHS AWAY FROM  THE PROCESS.
WHERE IS YES.
Jon: WHO DECIDES... THEY'VE DONE THE SAME THING WITH CONGRESSMAN PAUL. THEY'VE DECIDED HE'S NOT VIABLE SO THEY DIMINISH HIM. SOUNDS LIKE THEY DO THE SAME THING TO YOU AS WELL.
IT'S A PROCESS THAT MAKES NO SENSE. EARLY IN THE PROCESS-- WHERE WE ARE NOW-- NO STATE HAS HAD EVEN A PRIMARY. THE FIRST ONES WILL BE EARLY NEXT YEAR. THE GENERAL ELECTION IS 15 MONTHS AWAY. I THINK YOU WOULD WANT EVERYBODY WITH SOME EXPERIENCE-- GOVERNOR, CONGRESSMAN-- I'M THE ONLY GUY RUNNING WHO'S BEEN BOTH, A GUY WITH A PLAN TO GROW JOBS IN  AMERICA, I THINK WE CAN HAVE A BOOM IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: WAIT A MINUTE! YOU HAVE A PLAN TO GROW JOBS IN AMERICA?
I DO. I DO. I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED.
Jon: WELL FOR GOD'S SAKE, MAN! PUT IT OUT THERE! I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED BUT WE'RE HURTING! (APPLAUSE) THIS GETS TO THE LARGER POINT WHICH IS I THINK IN SOME WAYS  YOUR CANDIDACY SEEMS FOUNDED ON THE BASIS THAT WE HAVE AN ELECTORAL SICKNESS. ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ARE SYMPTOMS TO SOMETHING THAT IS SICK IN OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: WHAT IS THAT?
YOU CAN'T TACKLE THE JOBS PROBLEM, THE BUDGET PROBLEM, THE  TAX PROBLEM OR AMERICA RISING WITHOUT TACKLING THE FIRST PROBLEM: MONEY IN POLITICS. IT IS CORRUPT. IT IS INSTITUTIONALLY CORRUPT. THEY SPEND THEIR TIME GETTING BIG CHECKS FROM BIG SPECIAL INTERESTS. IT'S THE SPECIAL INTERESTS, JON, WHO WRITE THE TAX CODE. YOU CAN'T READ IT, IT DOESN'T WORK FOR AMERICA, IT HURTS JOBS, WE GIVE THEM AWAY, THEY'RE BEING STOLEN BY UNFAIR TRADE AND NOBODY DOES ANYTHING. YOU KNOW WHY? CORPORATIONS HAVE NEVER MADE MORE MONEY THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. THEY WROTE THE TAX CODE AND THEY REALLY DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE REST OF AMERICA. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: SIR, I'M GOING TO SAY THIS RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING SAY THIS RIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A MESSAGE THAT WILL RESONATE. (LAUGHTER)
WELL, HERE'S WHAT I'VE DONE, JON. I KNOW... I KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE FUN OF ME.
Jon: NO, I DON'T! HERE'S WHAT IS UPSETTING TO ME. EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE THAT WE HAVE FAILED THE COUNTRY PROCESS WISE.
YES.
Jon: THAT CORRUPTION HAS FOUND ITS WAY SYSTEMATICALLY INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THERE'S NOT A GUY UP ON THAT STAGE THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T SAY  "OH, YEAH, THERE'S TOO MUCH MONEY IN THIS." BUT WHAT IS IT THAT HAS  CALCIFIED IT IN THIS SYSTEM?
THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY. IN THE 21st CENTURY, I THINK YOU CAN APPEAL TO SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE, THE COMMON MAN AND  WOMAN, THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND WANT IT TO DO BETTER. PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE A FUTURE AND SAY $100, $50, $10. IF I COULD GET $10 FROM A MILLION PEOPLE, I'D SPEND IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WE WOULD  REVOLUTIONIZE POLITICS IN AMERICA, JON!
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHERE I WOULD SPEND IT? (LAUGHTER)
I'M WITH YOU, MAN.
Jon: I WOULD GO TO A COSTA RICA DRINK STAND AND BLOW THEIR MINDS. (LAUGHTER) NO, BUT I... IT'S A VALID POINT. I WISH YOU ALL THE... I WANT YOU TO COME BACK AND KEEP... BECAUSE IT IS... THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE  THE CRUCIAL FIGHT THAT IS AT THE BASE OF ALL THIS THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE IGNORING AND I WOULD  LIKE TO FOLLOW YOU AND SEE HOW IT HOLDS UP AND IF THEY BEGIN TO LET YOU IN OR JUST YOU'RE TOO  MUCH OF AN OUTSIDER.
WHERE IS I'LL COME BACK. SCREAM LATE AT NIGHT, I'LL BE HERE THE NEXT DAY.
Jon: REALLY?
YES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: BUDDY ROEMER, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GOOD LUCK TO YOU. (CH
