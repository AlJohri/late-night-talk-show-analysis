[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR YET ANOTHER INSTALLMENT IN OUR AWARD ADJACENT SERIESNT IN GAYWATCH. OUR FIRST STORY TONIGHT DAUGHTER OF THE FORMER VICE PRESIDENT LIZ CHENEY WHO IS RUNNING FOR SENATE. NOW YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF THAT REALLY DOESN'T SOUND SO GAY. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW CHENEY'S SISTER IS BOTH GAY AND MARRIED AND RECENTLY SUPPORTERS OF LIZ CHENEY'S SENATE PRIMARY OPPONENT MIKE ENZI DECIDED TO MAKE LIZ CHENEY CHOOSE SIDES.
SHE'S BEEN ATTACKED BY SUPERPAC ADS FOR BEING IN FAVOR OF GAY MARRIAGE. SHE APPEARS ON MSNBC TO CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE MARRIAGE AMENDMENT.
Jon: OH, MY GOD SHE APPEARS ON MSNBC THAT'S BASICALLY THE GAY BATH HOUSE OF CABLE NEWS. [LAUGHTER] THAT MAKES WHAT SHE SAID ON THE NETWORK GAY SQUARED. [LAUGHTER] BUT THIS WAS A CHANCE FOR LIZ CHENEY TO HAVE A DEFINING MOMENT TO STAND UP NOT ONLY FOR HER SISTER BUT FOR EQUALITY.
I DO BELIEVE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE LEFT UP TO THE STATES. I DO BELIEVE IN THE TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE.
Jon: YOU KNOW REMEMBER WHEN DICK CHENEY RETIRED AND WE WERE WORRIED THERE WOULDN'T BE A CHENEY ON TELEVISION SAYING AWFUL THINGS? THERE LIVES ANOTHER. BUT THE CHENEY'S ARE NOT ALONE IN FACING A BIT OF FUSS THESE DAYS.
HALLMARK'S NEW HOLIDAY SWEATER ORNAMENT USES A LYRIC FROM DECK THE HALLS DON WE NOW OUR FUN APPAREL. THEY USED THE WORD FUN TO REPLACE THE WORD GAY.
Jon: FIRST OF ALL HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SITTING AROUND THAT (bleep) TABLE? SECOND OF ALL THIS IS HAPPENING SO MUCH LIKE WHEN CONGRESS CHANGED THE NAME OF THE PLANE THAT DROPPED THE FIRST ATOMIC BOMB ON JAPAN TO THE ENOLA FUN LESS OFFENSIVE TO GAY PEOPLE AND WAY MORE OFFENSIVE TO JAPANESE PEOPLE. WHY DID HALLMARK DOESE THAT? AND IF NIGHTLINE COULD DRIVE IT HOME WITH A TECHNO BEAT IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.
THEY EXPLAINED THE WORD GAY HAD ONLY ONE  REAL MEANING AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE IT OPEN TO MISINTERPRETATION. ♪
Jon: SO IT'S ABOUT MISINTERPRETATION. THEY DIDN'T WANT THE CONFUSION, YOU KNOW, THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE CONFUSING THE MEANING OF THE SWEATER. IT'S LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH LAST YEAR'S HALLMARK HOLIDAY SWEATER ORNAMENT I WANT TO (bleep) FOR CHRISTMAS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHICH AS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THAT BELOVED OLD ENGLISH CHRISTMAS CAROL. I BELIEVE IT WENT SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF. ♪ I WANT TO SUCK YOUR (bleep) FOR CHRISTMAS ♪ ♪ I WANT -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] ♪ I WANT TO SUCK IT NOW  ♪ I'VE BEEN SO VERY GOOD  ♪ PLEASE  BY THE WAY -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WHY STOP THERE HALLMARK? THERE'S SO MANY OTHER CHRISTMAS TERMS THAT ARE OPEN TO MISINTERPRETATION, YULE LOG, CANDY CANES, STOCKY STUFFERS. WHAT ABOUT SANTA GOING DOWN THE CHIMNEY? THAT COULD MEAN SOMETHING ELSE ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S A GUY NAMED CHIMNEY OR WHAT ABOUT GIVING SANTA MILK AND COOKIES WHAT IF THEY MISINTERPRETATION THAT TO THE URBAN DICTIONARY SLANG FOR A GUY (bleep) IN ANOTHER GUY'S (bleep) AND THEN THEY KISS EACH OTHER AND SWIRL IT AROUND? [LAUGHTER] WHAT IF SOMEONE DID THAT TO SANTA? [LAUGHTER] WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? [LAUGHTER] STILL -- I WANTED TO POINT OUT IT'S A REAL THING ON URBAN DICTIONARY. IT'S A REAL THING AND YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE OTHER ONES. FOR THE LAST STORY TONIGHT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD END WITH GOOD NEWS.
GAY MARRIAGE NOW THE LAW IN HAWAII. THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE BILL MAKING THE ALOHA STATE THE 15th STATE PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO ALLOW SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.
Jon: YES! IT'S GREAT NEWS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HAWAIIAN GAY MARRIAGE. FINALLY HAWAII'S GAY CITIZENS CAN STAND UP AND SAY WE ARE DESERVING OF THE SAME DIGNITY AS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE ABOMINATION IN THE STATE OF HAWAII AND IT IS THEIR (bleep) DISGUSTING PIZZA. I MEAN HAM AND PINEAPPLE. EVEN CHICAGO THINKS YOUR PIZZA IS DISGUSTING. JUST KIDDING ABOUT THE PIZZA THING. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
