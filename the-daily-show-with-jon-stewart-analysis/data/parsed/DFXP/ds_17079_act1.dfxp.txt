Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, I'M UP THERE PLAYING VIDEO IMGAS, SHE'S OVER THERE WRITING BOOKS FOR GOD'S SAKES. MAKES ME MAD, QUITE FRANKLY. SHE'S GOT TO TAKE IT EASIER. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE BIG NEWS IN WASHINGTON THIS WEAK. AT FORDABLE CARE ACT, AKA OBAMACARE, AKA THE SOCIALIST TAKE OVER OF AMERICA'S COLONS. HAS MADE ITS WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT FOR THREE DAYS OF INTRICATE LEGAL DISCUSSION OF THE  CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE HEALTH CARE MANDATE. I DON'T THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING. (LAUGHTER) 24 HOUR NEWS NETWORK YOU CAN SELL IT?
DAY ONE OF AN EPIC HEALTH CARE SHOWDOWN.
THIS IS A MASSIVE DAY IN AMERICAN HISTORY WANTS EPIC LEGAL BATTLE.
THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGAL DEBATE IN YEARS.
JUST HOW BIG A DEAL IS THIS ON A SCALE OF, LIKE WATERGATE AND BUSH V GORE.
PROBABLY THE TWO OF THEM TOGETHER JSES.
Jon: I'M MUST SEE THIS ON SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY. YOU HAD ME AT BIGGER THAN WATERGATE. YOU KNOW WHY JUSTICE IS BLIND, SHE STARED DIRECTLY INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THAT BIG. LIKE EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS IN THIS COUNTRY AMERICANS CAN BE DIVIDED-- DID YOU ENJOY THAT? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL DAY LONG WE SPEND TRYING TO DISSTILL THREE DAYS OF SUPREME COURT  ARGUMENTS INTO DIGESTIBLE BITES AND HOT, HOT DOCKET, THAT'S THE THING. I HAVE EATEN THOSE-- OH, WAIT A MINUTE. THE SPELLING IS DIFFERENT, THERE IS A GAVEL IN THE PICTURE. AS WE KNOW AMERICANS CAN BE DIINDIVIDUAL MOOD ONLY TWO CAMPS. REPRESENTATIVES OF WHICH GATHERED OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM. SUPPORTER OF OBAMACARE ON ONE SIDE.
I THINK NEFERN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE.
I PAY FOR MY OWN HEALTH CARE. I'M OUT HERE FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T.
Jon: OH, ALL RIGHT, LOVELY SENTIMENT. AND OPPONENTS OF THE BILL.
WE WON'T HAVE RIGHTS.
FREEDOM.
WHEN DOW WANT IT.
TO YOU WITHIN HONSLY I WILL NOT COMPLY WITH THE LAW BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SO NOW WE HAVE THE TWO SIDES HAVE DRAWN THE BATTLE LINES IT'S I BELIEVE  PREEXISTING CONDITION US SHOULD NOT DISCUL FEW PEOPLE, VERSUS I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM. I GOT TO SAY THOSE DO NOT SEAM LIKE TWO HAVELS OF THE SAME ARGUMENT. THE SCALING SEEMS ODD, I'M TEAM JAY COULD BE.
I'M ANTI-TYRANNY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. HATE'S GREAT. LESS HOLOCAUST. ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING TO BALANCE THIS. I BELIEVE THE OBAMACARE SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE MADE THE MISTAKE OF BRINGING A  PROVISION TO A PRINCIPLES FIGHT. SO LET'S SEE HOW THE COURT VIEWS IT. NOW UNFORTUNATE LEIGH CAMERAS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT THE SUPREME COURT SO WE  CAN'T SHOW YOU VIDEO OF THE HEARING. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THEY BEGAN WITH A SELLOUT CROWD FILING IN. AND THEN PROMPTLY AT 10 A.M. THE 9 JUSTICES SLIDE DOWN INTO PLACE, A PACKED GALLERY OF JOURNALISTS, INTERESTED  PARTIES AND OF COURSE MARK'S MOST BELOVED JUDGE CEE-LO. (LAUGHTER) HE'S THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF OUR HEARTS. HAT TIP TO OUR FRIENDS THE IMAGINEEERS AT THE TAIWANESE ANIMATION STUDIO. (LAUGHTER) LET'S SEE HOW THAT REDUCTIVE OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM SCREAMING MATCH PLAYS OUT  INSIDE THE COURTROOM.
INSURANCE HAS BECOME THE PREDOMINANT MEANS OF PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT FOR MORE THAN 40 MILLION AMERICANS, WITHOUT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH  INSURANCE, THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS ALL POWERS. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED POWERS.
Jon: WHAT, WHAT WHAT, YES, NO WONDER THEY DON'T WANT CAMERAS IN THERE, THAT SHOW SUCKS. I GUESS BASICALLY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THE GOVERNMENT SEES A PROBLEM, THAT PEOPLE  DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING ATHAT IN ORDER FOR ALL PEOPLE TO BE COVERED AND FOR  PRIVATE INSURANCE TO NOT GO BANKRUPT BY COVERING ALL PEOPLE THEY MUST HAVE A PAN  DATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT EVERYONE HAS TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. AND SCALIA IS SAYING YEAH-- YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT WOULD FIX IT BUT YOU DON'T  HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT, [BLEEP] BUT WHAT WAS SO INTERESTING WAS WATCHING BOTH SIDES TAKE THAT ARGUMENT TO THEIR LOGICAL CONCLUSION. TO SEE THE EXACT POINT WHERE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN TALKING PAST EACH OTHER.
IN THE HEALTH-CARE MARKET ARE YOU GOING INTO THE MARKET WITHOUT THE ABILITY  TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET, GETTING THE HEALTH-CARE SERVICE ANYWAY AS A RESULT OF THE SOCIAL NORMS THAT  ALLOW, THAT, TO WHICH WE'VE OBLIGATED OURSELVES.
DON'T OBLIGATE YOURSELF TO THAT.
Jon: THAT RIGHT THERE, DID YOU HEAR IT. DON'T OBLIGATE YOURSELF TO THAT. THE GUY ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE IS TWISTING HIMSELF INTO PRETZEL TO FIND A WAY  TO PAY FOR THE PREVIOUSLYLY UNINSURED 40 MILLION PEOPLE THAT GET EMERGENCY ROOM CARE  BUT CAN'T PAY FOR IT WELL, TAKE THIS OVER HERE, TAKE SOME FAT OUT OF THE ASS PUT IT IN THE LIPS. AND THE OTHER GUY IS LIKE HAVE YOU TRIED, I DON'T KNOW  [BLEEP] WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS FREEDOM AND SOCIETY IS. THAT'S-- YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW IT IS THAT THE PARTY THAT CREATIONISTS CALL HOME  IS SO DARWINNIAN. THAT'S THE CRAZY PART. THIS IS THE WAY THE ARGUMENTS WENT. THE LIBERAL JUDGES CLINGING TO THEIR MOST PRECIOUS VALUES. THE CONSERVATIVE JUDGES CLINGING TO THEIR MOST PRECIOUS VALUES. AND THAT BASICALLY JUST LEFT THE LAWYERS TAKING TURNS FIGHTING OVER THE ONLY SWING  VOTE ON THE PANEL JUSTICE KENNEDY. (LAUGHTER) I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW WHY ONE SIDE TRIES TO BUY HIM YOU HAVE A AND THE OTHER  SIDE JUST GIVES HIM ICE CREAM. ANYWAY, ULTIMATELY WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THE THREE-DAYS OF ARGUMENT? WHO WON THE COURT CASE OF FREEDOM V SOCIAL CONTRACT.
THIS WAS A TRAIN WRECK.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HAILT CARE-- HEALTH CARE LAW COULD BE ON LIFE-SUPPORT.
AND IT MAY ALSO BE A PLANE WRECK (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND DOWN GOES SOCIAL CONTRACT. 8, 9, 10, IT'S OVER! THANK GOD, THE DISASTER OF THAT WASN'T CAPTURED BY CAMERAS, AS LADY LIBERTY--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JUST TOOK A-- OH MY GOD. (LAUGHTER)  [BLEEP] BIDEN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
