FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. AUTHOR MARILYNNE ROACH. SHE HAS A NEW BOOK ON THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS AND HER SEARCH FOR THE REAL KILLER. [LAUGHTER] BEFORE WE GET STARTED, IF YOUR SCHOOL IS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR A CHEMISTRY TEACHER, I WANT TO YOU TO CALL US. [LAUGHTER] I GOT A GUY HERE. BOSTON UNIVERSITY. HE SEEMS SMART -- COULD HAVE SHAVED. [LAUGHTER] CHEMISTRY MAJOR LOOKING FOR A JOB TEACHING CHEMISTRY. I'M LIKE HOW CAN YOU NOT GET A JOB TEACHING CHEMISTRY. IF YOU NEED A CHEMISTRY TEACHER CONTACT US AND I WILL FINALLY GET THIS (bleep) KID OUT OF HIS PARENTS' HOUSE. THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. LEAVE YOUR NAME. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YES, HEALING AMERICA! [LAUGHTER] NOTHING, HUH? OF COURSE, EVEN NOW IN THIS COUNTRY WHILE WE'VE MOSTLY RULED OUT BURNING PEOPLE LIKE WITCHES WE STILL DEBATE WHAT TO DO WITH OUR MOST SUSPICIOUS CITIZENS. THANKS SO OLD GOODY SNOWDEN HERE. EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST 8 MONTHS WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE AMERICAN SURVEILLANCE STATE AND THE NSA. THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T SPYING ON AMERICANS. [ LAUGHTER ] THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T ABUSING THEIR POWER. [LAUGHTER] THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T CUTTING HOLES IN THE GIRLS SHOWER HOUSE TO SEE BOOBIES BUT WE KNOW THE TRUTH. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL LAST FRIDAY IT WAS FINALLY TIME FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE NSA WITH A VERY DIFFICULT NEEDLE TO THREAD. HOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY WHILE NOT UPSETTING PEOPLE WHO APPARENTLY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US. HOW TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CHANGES WHILE ALSO NOT REALLY DOING THAT. HOW WOULD HE ACCOMPLISH THIS DELICATE DANCE?
AT THE DAWN OF OUR REPUBLIC --
Jon: OH, GOD. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. GONNA BE ONE OF THESE. LET'S DO IT.
AT THE DAWN OF OUR REPUBLIC, A SMALL SECRET SURVEILLANCE COMMITTEE BORN OUT OF THE SONS OF LIBERTY WAS ESTABLISHED IN BOSTON. IN THE CIVIL WAR UNION BALLOONS, RECONNAISSANCE TRACKED THE SIZE OF CONFEDERATE ARMIES. IN WORLD WAR II CODE BREAKERS GAVE US INSIGHTS INTO JAPANESE WAR PLANS. IN THE COLD WAR, PRESIDENT TRUMAN CREATED THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY OR NSA. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT WHEN YOU TICKLE. I LIKE IT WHEN YOU TICKLE. [ LAUGHTER ] I WASN'T SLEEPING THROUGH THE PRESIDENT'S NEW A&E SPECIAL, THE HISTORY OF SURVEILLANCE. I WAS JUST SITTING HERE. [LAUGHTER] WELL, IT'S A GREAT STRATEGY. OBAMA HAS A RELATIVELY IMPOSSIBLE TASK SO HE THOUGHT RATHER THAN ATTEMPT IT WHY NOT TALK SO LONG AND BORINGLY THAT PEOPLE STOP LISTENING. IT'S THE OLD HOPE A DOPE. THOUGH HE DID GET TO HIS POINT. THE DANGER IS REAL.
WE CANNOT UNILATERALLY DISARM OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES THERE'S A REASON WHY BLACKBERRIES AND iPHONES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM.
Jon: I KNOW IT'S BIDEN, ISN'T IT? [LAUGHTER] WON'T STOP INTERRUPTING EVERYBODY WITH HIS SNAP CHATTING. [ LAUGHTER ] HE'S GOT THE -- [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT'S NICE. I HAVE FOUND THE LEVEL OF THE AUDIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] DID NOTHING. GOT ALL THESE CLEVER LITTLE THINS WORKED OUT. YOU HAVE TO DRAW A COUPLE DICKS ON A PICTURE. CROWD GOES NUTS. SO THE DANGER OF TERROR IS REAL. WE HAVE TO LET THE NSA DO ITS JOB.
IN THE 1960'S GOVERNMENT SPIED ON CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS AND CRITICS OF VIETNAM WAR.
Jon: THE DANGER OF GOVERNMENT OVERREACH IS REAL. WE HAVE TO STOP THE NSA FROM DOING THEIR JOB. WE HAVE US AN OLD FASHIONED ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR HERE. HOW DO WE STOP THIS LOSE LOSE?
I BELIEVE WE NEED A NEW APPROACH, ONE IN WHICH THE PROVIDERS RETAIN THE RECORDS WITH  GOVERNMENT ACCESSING INFORMATION AS NEEDED.
Jon: WHAT?  NOT EVEN THE GOVERNMENT TRUSTS THE GOVERNMENT WITH OUR PRIVATE INFORMATION. SO OUR DATA WILL APPARENTLY BE MOVED FROM A BUILDING LIKE THIS TO A BUILDING LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] PROBLEM SOLVED. [ LAUGHTER ] MORE PROTECTION, PLEASE.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, WE WILL ONLY PURSUE PHONECALLS THAT ARE TWO STEPS REMOVED FROM A NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT THREE.
Jon: SO -- HMMMM, IF YOU KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY WHO KNOWS A TERRORIST, YOU ARE. (bleep)ED. BUT IF YOU KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY WHO KNOWS A GUY WHO KNOWS A TERRORIST, PASS THE NACHOS. WHAT IF YOU CALL PAPA JOHN'S TO ORDER A PIZZA BUT IT'S THE SAME PAPA JOHN'S THAT A TERRORIST ALSO CALLED TO ORDER PIZZA? THEREFORE, YOU KNOW A GUY WHO KNOWS A TERRORIST WITHOUT KNOWING IT? OBVIOUSLY I'M ONLY USING PAPA JOHNS AS AN EXAMPLE. I'M NOT SAYING TERRORISTS WOULD CALL PAPA JOHN'S. THEY ARE TERRORISTS NOT MONSTERS. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD UNDERMINE THIS REFORM TALK? IF THESE CHANGES CONTAINED ANY GLARING LOOPHOLES. THE DATABASE CAN BE QUERYED OVER AFTER A FINDING OR IN THE CASE OF A TRUE EMERGENCY. IT WILL TERMINATE WITHIN A FIXED TIME UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATES A REAL NEED FOR FURTHER SECRECY.
Jon: BASICALLY THE RULE IS WE'LL TOTALLY FOLLOW THE RULES UNTIL SUCH A TIME WHERE WE DETERMINE WE WILL NO LONGER FOLLOW THE RULES BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU WON'T HEAR IT BECAUSE WE'LL DO IT SECRETLY. I'M BEING PESSIMISTIC. IS THIS PERFECT? OF COURSE NOT. BUT AT LEAST THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO EARN BACK THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY DEMONST A SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE. HOW DO WE MOVE THESE REFORMS FORWARD?
I'M OPEN TO WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO ENSURE WE BUILD A BROAD CONSENSUS OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD.
Jon: SO WE'RE NEVER DOING IT. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS AFTER WE GET A BROAD CONSENSUS IN CONGRESS WITH YOU OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD? WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT THEN PERHAPS WE'LL GET WELL REASONED POST GAME ANALYSIS FROM RICHARD SHERMAN. HOW ABOUT THAT? AND THEN MAYBE AFTER THAT -- [  APPLAUSE  ] -- WE CAN ALL GO OUT FOR UNICORN BURGERS AND LEPRECHAUN JUICE. THE IDEA IS THIS:  THE REFORMS ARE WEAK BUT DON'T WORRY THEY'LL NEVER TAKE EFFECT. IS THERE AN UPSIDE?
ONE THING I'M CERTAIN OF THIS DEBATE WILL MAKE US STRONGER.
Jon: GOOD WHICH IS WHY THE PERSON WHO STARTED THE DEBATE MUST BE HUNTED DOWN AND THROWN IN PRISON FOR LIFE. THIS IS HOW CONVOLUTED OUR POSITION IS ON THIS ISSUE. IN THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH HE PRAISED VITAL 1970'S REFORMS AND SAFEGUARDS TO THE DOMESTIC SPYING PROGRAMS. HOW DID THEY COME ABOUT.
FIVE BURGLERS COMING OUT OF SHADOWS TO ADMIT THEIR PART IN AN AUDACIOUS BREAK IN 40 YEARS AGO AT THE F.B.I. THEY EXPOSED DOCUMENTS THAT EXPOSED A SPYING OPERATION.
Jon: NOW THEY ARE PRAISED IN THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH NOW WE KNOW LONG IT TAKES BEFORE STEALING U.S. SECRETS IS CONSIDERED PATRIOTIC. FAST FORWARD TO 2054 AND IT'S I PRESIDENT GORNAX HEREBY GRANT I EDWARD SNOWDEN A SPACE PARDON. GOOD NIGHT, AND MORD BLARK BLESS AMERICA.
