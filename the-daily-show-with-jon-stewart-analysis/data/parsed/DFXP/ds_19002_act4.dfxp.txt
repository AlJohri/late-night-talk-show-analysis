SO NOW YOU OPEN THIS UP AND YOU HAVE THIS BLUEPRINT INTO MAYBE NOT YOUR SON'S SOUL BUT INTO THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A COMPLEXITY AND A NUANCE TO THIS PERSON'S INNER LIFE, THAT IS NOT EVIDENT. HOW DOES THAT HELP YOU?  HOW DOES THAT MAKE -- DOES IT MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED?  DOES IT EASE YOUR MIND?  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHEN YOU LEARN THIS?
TO ME, VERY PARTICULARLY, IT ENCOURAGES ME TO GIVE MY OWN SON'S CAPABILITY AND POTENTIAL MUCH MORE CREDIT THAN I OTHERWISE WOULD, IF HE DROPS A TOP ON THE FLOOR AND WALKS OFF, PREVIOUSLY I WOULD SAY, WELL HE HAS AUTISM, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  BUT NOW, REALLY BECAUSE OF THE BOOK, I WILL SAY, PICK UP THE TOP, BRING IT OVER TO THE TABLE AND PUT IT THERE. AND HE DOES. AND I GIVE HIM FIVE AND SORT OF A VIRTUOUS SPIRAL KICKS IN. IT IS A VIRTUOUS SPIRAL, BECAUSE I KNOW THE POTENTIAL OR I BELIEVE THE POTENTIAL FOR A MUCH GREATER -- WHAT IS THERE. I BOTHER TO EXPOSE MY SON TO MORE LANGUAGE. MY EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGHER, AND I THINK ANY TEACHER EVEN IN AN ORDINARY MAINSTREAM CONTEXT WOULD AGREE. WHEN YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGHER, THEN THE PERFORMANCE CREEPS UP BECAUSE THE YOUNG PERSON IS THINKING, WELL, I AM BEING TREATED LIKE I HAVE A BRAIN HERE.
RIGHT. AND THE DIRECTION IS UPWARDS.
AND THERE IS INCREDIBLE SPECIFICITY. THE QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK ARE, WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHEN THEY TALK?  AND THE BOY ANSWERS, I AM UNCOMFORTABLE LOOKING AT PEOPLE'S EYES IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING NEAR THEM OR WITH THEM, IT MAKES ME WEIRD WHEN I DO, OR HE WILL SAY, WHEN I AM TALKING WHY IS IT SO HARD TO KEEP YOUR ATTENTION?  WELL, BECAUSE I AM PAYING ATTENTION TO THE FEEL OF YOUR VOICE AND THAT IS WHY HE IS VERY SPECIFIC AND HE SAYS, WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO ME, SAY MY FIRST NAME.
YES.
SAY MY NAME TO ME BEFORE YOU SPEAK.
SO IT IS ALMOST -- HE IS LAYING OUT CERTAIN INSTRUCTIONS.
LIKE A HOW TO GUIDE, YES. IT'S A LIST OF ABOUT 60 OF THESE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. SOME AS YOU SAY ARE MORE OBVIOUS THINGS, BUT OTHER QUESTIONS YOU NEVER STOP TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT DO PEOPLE WITH AUTISM THINK ABOUT AUTISM THEMSELVES?  HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE TIME?  HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE MEMORY?  WHAT IS IT TO REMEMBER, IF YOU HAVE AUTISM?  AND ONE BY ONE, A NUMBER --  RECEIVED UNHELPFUL WISDOM I HAD ABSORBED WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING IT, IT GETS REPLACED INTO A MUCH MORE HELPFUL AND USEFUL THING.
IT DID STRIKE ME AS THIS IDEA OF LIVING IN A BALL PIT AND THEY SAY WHY DO YOU REPEAT THESE PHRASES? AND HE SAYS, MY MIND IS NOT ORDERED.
YES.
AND I WORK VERY HARD AT TRYING TO ORDER IT AND WHEN THERE IS A PHRASE I PICK UP ON, I NEED TO -- IT IS ALMOST -- IT FEELS LIKE A CHILD LOST IN THE WOODS, IT IS ALMOST LIKE HE IS TRYING TO LEAVE BREAD CRUMBS FOR HIMSELF TO FIND HIS WAY BACK.
YES.
TO A WAY TO COMMUNICATE IN THE WAY THAT HE WANTS TO CONNECT AND HE CAN CONNECT.
YES, YES, YES. THE BOOK DOES THIS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, BUT JUST THE GENERAL NOTION THAT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE GOING ON BEHIND THAT WALL OF SPEECHLESSNESS, THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT RUN CONTRARY TO WHAT WE THINK ABOUT AUTISM. HE GIVES EVIDENCE THAT HE CAN IMAGINE AND ANALYZE AND THERE IS MENTAL ELOQUENCE THERE. HE CAN USE METAPHOR, THERE IS A SHORT STORY. THE SHORT STORY HE WROTE. IT'S REMARKABLE. AND I THOUGHT ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS, THEY WOULD ASK HIM, WOULD YOU CHANGE HAVING AUTISM?  AND THIS IS A 13-YEAR-OLD KID. AND HE GOES WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I THINK I WOULD HAVE. BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, IF THEY CAME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I COULD TAKE THAT WOULD CHANGE IT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD BECAUSE OF THE RICHNESS. HE RECOGNIZES THE RICHNESS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS DIFFERENT IN THE MANNER IN WHICH HE PROCESSES THE WORLD. >>I LOVE HOW THE BOOK ENDOWS PEOPLE WITH AUTISM DIGNITY. THERE IS A BRIEF SECTION THAT SORT OF HOW DO YOU WANT US TO TREAT YOU?  AND HE MENTIONS THERE THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM JUST DESERVE MORE CREDIT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY HAVE. WE ARE SO USED TO, I THINK, EQUATING SOMEONE'S INTELLIGENCE WITH THE WAY WE ARTICULATE OURSELVES.
YES.
BUT WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE WHO HAS THIS ENORMOUS OUTPUT PROBLEM, WHEREBY IT IS SO HARD FOR THEM TO SAY ANYTHING, WE ASSUME, THEREFORE, AS WE SAID EARLIER, THEY ARE BROKEN, IN LESS, POLITICALLY CORRECT TERMS, THEY ARE BASKET CASES.
RIGHT.
AND I FEEL THAT THE BOOK IS A POWERFUL AND LIFE ENHANCING REBUTTAL OF THAT VIEW.
NO QUESTION AND THE FACT THAT THE ISOLATION IS NOT A CHOICE BUT IS A DESPERATE SEARCH FOR THE RIGHT -- FOR THE ROSETTA STONE, FOR THE RIGHT KEY THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNICATE IN THE MANNER THAT IS FULFILLING TO THEM.
THAT IS A GOOD METAPHOR. BECAUSE FOR THE REST OF US THIS MYSTIFYING BEHAVIOR IS RATHER LIKE HIEROGLYPHICS. WE CAN'T MAKE HEADS OF TAILS OF.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE HIM SAY, I WISH PEOPLE WHO HAD THE SYNDROME, GOT MORE CREDIT FOR THE HEROISM OF THEIR DAILY LIVES, THE STRUGGLE THEY HAVE TO MERELY MEET THE STANDARD THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE ASKING OF THEM.
YES, YES. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. IT IS SO EASY TO FORGET THAT IN THE HURLY-BURLY OF THE 24/7.
AND I GIVE YOU ALL THE CREDIT IN THE WORLD, AND I AM SO DELIGHTED YOU ARE PUTTING THIS BOOK OUT THERE AND I REALLY URGE PEOPLE TO GET IT. IT IS FASCINATING, AND VERY AFFIRMING, THE REASON I JUMP, IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW YES AND YOU CAN GET IT IF YOU WANT, DAVID MITCHELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
