Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN ACTOR. HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED CAPTAIN AMERICA THE WINTER SOLDIER: HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED CAPTAIN AMERICA THE WINTER SOLDIER: HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED CAPTAIN AMERICA THE WINTER SOLDIER:
WARNING APPROACHING INTERSECTION.
GET ME OFF THE GRID.
Jon: WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SAMUEL L. JACKSON. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
LOOK AT THIS. WOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: ENJOY. SOAK IT IN. SOAK IT IN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GM BABY, IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?
Jon: THIS IS A CONTINUING SAGA OF THE BAD ASSERY OF SAMUEL JACKSON. [LAUGHTER]
THANK YOU.
Jon: MORE, MORE AND MORE. THESE FILMS, THESE CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR 50 YEARS, 60 YEARS.
NICK FURY WAS AROUND WHEN I WAS A KID. I USED TO READ NICK FURY BOOKS. THEN HE BECAME DAVID HASSELHOFF FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE BECAME ME. THE EVOLUTION OF NICK FURY CONTINUES.
Jon: IT DOES INDEED AND MAY I SAY IT'S BEEN UPGRADED.
THANK YOU.
Jon: I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE. I LIKE TO FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.
Jon: THEY WERE NEVER ABLE, THE TECHNOLOGY OF MOVIES WAS NEVER AT THE ADVANCED LEVEL THAT IT IS NOW THAT THE SUPER HEROES COULD ON SCREEN REALLY APPEAR REALISTIC AND IT COULD -- YOU COULD GET THE JOLT. I WONDER IF THAT'S WHY IT'S ONLY NOW THIS THESE MOVIES ARE SO BIG.
I THINK PART OF IT IS THE TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO I THINK PART OF IT IS THE ACCESSIBILITY OF WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO AS REAL PEOPLE NOW. WHEN I WAS A KID I WOULD READ A COMIC BOOK AND WANT TO BE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE WERE WOMEN WALKING AROUND IN TIGHTS WITH GREEN HAIR AND BLUE HAIR AND FOLKS HAD CAPES ON AND THEY WERE WEARING BOOTS.
Jon: THEY CALL THAT SAN FRANCISCO.
EXACTLY AND NOW WE HAVE ALL THAT AND PEOPLE ARE WALKING AROUND TALKING ON THINGS AND LOOKING AT STUFF ON THE LITTLE DEVICES. SO IT'S ALL VERY REAL FOR US. THE ONLY THING THAT'S MISSING FOR US IS THIS CAT THAT ACTUALLY FLIES.
Jon: YES.
AND LANDS SOMEWHERE. HE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE SOMEWHERE JUST WAITING TO COME OUT.
Jon: I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT. I WONDER. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SCIENCE TAKES ITS CUES FROM ALL OF THE GREAT, ASIMOV AND WELLS, ALL THE GREAT SORT OF FICTION WRITERS AND SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS AND THEY SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A COMIC STRIP AND GO I BET I CAN MAKE THAT. THEY ARE TAKING THEIR CUES FROM THE IMAGINATIONS OF A GUY LIKE STAN LEE.
THERE'S THAT AND THERE'S ALSO THE FACT THAT -- I USED TO DREAM I COULD FLY. I USED TO DREAM I COULD BREATHE UNDER WATER AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. I WANTED TO DO IT REALLY BADLY. NOW I PUT ON THAT COSTUME AND I FALL INTO THAT MARVEL PLAYGROUND AND I'M LIKE I'M IN HEAVEN. THIS IS HAPPENING. I PUT MY EYE PATCH ON AND I WALK OUT THERE AND I'M INVINCIBLE, MAN.
Jon: THEY CREATE IT REALISTICALLY. IN THE OLD DAYS A SUPERHERO LIKE HULK THEY WOULD JUST FIND THE BIGGEST GUY THEY COULD AND PAINT HIM GREEN AND THAT WOULD BE --
YEAH.
Jon: BUT THE EFFECTS NOW AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT SURROUNDS IT. IS IT -- WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT, WHEN YOU ARE MAKING IT IS IT TEDIOUS? IS IT -- DO YOU FEEL THE EXCITEMENT OR YOU IN SPANDEX IN FRONT OF A GREEN FLAT AND THEY ARE LIKE NOW THE MONSTER IS COMING?
IN THE BEGINNING YOU SORT OF FELT THAT WAY. BACK WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING STAR WARS IT WAS JUST A GREEN ROOM AND WE HAD SOME THINGS IN THERE. I HAD A LIGHT SABER AND GEORGE WOULD SAY OK THERE'S A THING ATTACKING YOU. I WOULD SAY HOW BIG IS IT? HE WOULD SAY AS BIG AS AN S.U.V.? I GO, REALLY. I SAID HOW FAST IS IT? HE SAID FAST AS YOU WANT IT TO BE? I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT AND YOU'LL DRAW STUFF AROUND ME? HE SAID YOU KICK ALL THE ASS YOU WANT AND WE'LL MAKE SURE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE THE BADDEST MOTHER (bleep) IN THE UNIVERSE. SO I'M BACK IN MY ROOM, I'M JUMPING AND RUNNING, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN I GO TO THE MOVIE IT'S LIKE (bleep). LOOK AT ME.
Jon: AMAZING.
Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S ALL THAT AND MORE BUT WHEN YOU ARE DOING (bleep) LIKE THAT CAR CHASE.
Jon: YEAH.
WE HAD LIKE --
Jon: THAT LOOKS ACTUALLY DANGEROUS.
WE HAD LIKE 12 CARS THAT ALL DID DIFFERENT (bleep). WHEN YOU SEE THE MOVIE THERE'S ONE POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE 19 GUYS FIRING BULLETS AT IT. THE WINDOWS ARE JUST RESISTING THE BULLETS. I'M JUST SITTING IN THE CAR LIKE THAT'S LIKE A DOPE ASS FEELING LIKE YEAH MOTHER (bleep). >>YEAH. AND IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.
WE WERE SHOOTING IN CLEVELAND. WE'RE ON THE STREETS OF CLEVELAND. THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE BUILDS LIKE (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I'M EXCITED. THEY HAVE MADE -- I'M TELLING YOU MARVEL STUDIOS THEY'VE MADE THESE MOVIES SO WELL AND THEY ARE DOING TREMENDOUS STUFF WITH THIS. I'VE BEEN LOVING IT.
LIKE I TOLD YOU BACK STAGE THIS ONE ACTUALLY HAS A STORY, HAS A PLOT.
Jon: THAT DOESN'T OFTEN HAPPEN.
IT'S MORE THAN BAD GUYS PUNCHING GOOD GUYS. IT'S A BIG ASS MYSTERY GOING ON IN HERE. AND I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW THEY GOT ROBERT REDFORD TO DO THIS MOVIE.
Jon: IT'S AWESOME.
IT'S LIKE ROBERT REDFORD IS IN THIS MOVIE.
Jon: ARE YOU TEMPTED AT ANY POINT IN THE MOVIE TO JUST MOVE YOUR EYE PATCH TO THE OTHER SIDE?
NO, BECAUSE MY SCAR IS OVER HERE. IT'S LIKE YEAH.
Jon: CAPTAIN AMERICA:  WINTER SOLDIER. THEATERS ON FRIDAY. SAMUEL L. JACKSON.
