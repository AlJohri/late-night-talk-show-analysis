FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  HEY, WELCOME TO THE  "DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. HERE'S OUR SHOW TONIGHT. VALI NASR WILL BE JOINING US. AUTHOR VALI NASR WILL BE JOINING  US. BUT FIRST TONIGHT, IF I MAY,  HE'S BAAACD.
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH  STEPS BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME TO DEDICATE HIS  PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY.
Jon:  HA-HA-  STAY COOL, JOHNNY, BOY. STAY COOL. ( LAUGHTER )  BECAUSE IT'S THE OPENING SER  MOPE OF THE BUSH LIBRARY. IT'S BEEN FOUR AND A HALF YEARS  SINCE WE'VE SEEN PRESIDENT BUSH. I IMAGINE LIKE MOST EXPRESIDENT  HE'S DEVOTING HIMSELF TO PUBLIC  SERVICE. 88-YEAR-OLD JIMMY CARTER  LITERALLY PULLING THE LAST  REMAINING GUINEA WORMS OUT OF POOR CHILDREN'S FEET WITH HIS  HANDS. LOOK, WHAT'S-- WHAT'S PRESIDENT  BUSH BEEN UP TO?
I PAINT TWO OR THREE HOURS A  DAY. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )    ( CHEERS ).
Jon:  SOMETIMES IT'ST  SEEMS ONLY A GALLON OF PAINT,  DROWN OUT THE SCREAMS OF THOSE I'VE WRONGED. ( LAUGHTER )  PLUS, SOMETIMES THEY LET YOU USE  YOUR FINGERS. ( LAUGHTER )
I COULD LAY OUT 20 OF THE  PAINTINGS, AND YOU MIGHT LIKE  ONE.
YEAH.
AND SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE  ANOTHER.
BUT ARE YOU GETTING BETTER IS  THE QUESTION?
I THINK SO. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL IN THE  EYES OF THE BEHOLDER.
Jon:  SURE, SO, IN OTHER  WORDS, ART HISTORY WILL BE THE  JUDGE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  BUT I LOVE PRESIDENTIAL  LIBRARIES. YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO  FIND IN THIS ONE?
THE GEORGE W. BUSH  PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM  SITS ON 23 ACRES OF THE SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. INSIDE THE COMPLEX, A TREASURE  TROVE OF MORE THAN 43,000  ARTIFACTS FROM THE BUSH  PRESIDENCY. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  BASICALLY THE HARD  ROCK CAFE OF CATASTROPHIC POLICY  DECISIONS. ( LAUGHTER )  NOW, I GUESS THIS IS-- AS GOOD A  TIME FOR BUSH TO OPEN UP A  LIBRARY AS ANY TIME.
AS TIME PASSES AND PASSIONS  COOL, MR. BUSH HAS FROAN MORE  POPULAR.
A PERFECT EXAMPLE FOR GEORGE  W. BUSH IS HIS FATHER GEORGE  HERBERT WALKER BUSH, WHO LOOKS FAR BETTER 20 YEARS AFTER  LEAVING OFFICE.
Jon:  RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER ). BECAUSE HE'S BEING COMPARED TO  GEORGE W. THAT'S WHY HE LOOKS BETTER. I'M SURE-- LISTEN F-1 OF G.W.'S  KIDS BECOMES PRESIDENT IN 2032  AND SOMEHOW FOR SNOW REASON INVADES THE MOON, I'M SURE WE'LL  LOOK BACK AT W AND GO HE WASN'T  SO BAD. A LOT LESS MOON DEATHS IN HIS  PRESIDENCY. ANY LIBRARY WILL HAVE TO GRAPPLE  WITH THE DECISION MADE BY THIS  PRESIDENT-- IRAQ, KATRINA, THE FINANCIAL CRISE.
VISITORS CAN GO AND THEY CAN  GET ACTUAL ADVICE FROM THE REAL  ADVISERS TO PRESIDENT BUSH, AND IT ALLOWS VISITORS TO MAKE  DECISIONS LIKE PRESIDENT BUSH  DID. ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF THIS  MUSEUM IS WHAT'S CALLED THE  DECISION POINT THEATER. IT'S AN INTERACTIVE EXHIBIT.
Jon:  YEAH, I GUESS  THAT'S BETTER THAN ITS ORIGINAL  TITLE-- "DISASTERPIECE THEATRE." FOR MORE, WE GO LIVE TO  ALMADRIGAL WHO JUST FINISHED HIS  TOUR OF THE GEORGE W. BUSH PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY. AL, YOU FINISHED THE TOUR--  WAIT, WHAT IS THAT IN YOUR HAND?
GEORGE W. BUSH STAKE ON A  STICK, JON. STEAK ON A ( BLEEP ) STICK. THIS IS LITERALLY THE GREATEST  LIBRARY EVER. THE EXHIBITS, STATE-OF-THE-ART. THE ARCHITECTURE IS SIMPLE YET  ELEGANT. I USED THE BATHROOM. I DON'T THINK IT HAD EVER BEEN  TOUCHED BEFORE. WAY IN THE BARK SO QUIET, SO  CLEAN.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, AL,  LET'S NOT--
IT WAS LIKE TAKING A DUMP IN  A BRAND NEW CADILLAC.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )  IT'S NICE WHEN YOU FIND THOSE  SPOTS.
AFTER-- AFTER A COUPLE OF  THESE BAD BOYS I HAD A LITTLE  SHOCK AND AWE OF MY OWN.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,  CAN WE-- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE  MUSEUM?
YUP. IT'S INCREDIBLE. DECISION POINTS THEATER,  AMAZING. I ACED IT BY THE WAY. INVAED IRAQ? YES. RESCUE NEW ORLEANS? NO. BAIL OUT WALL STREET? PASS THE CHECKBOOK.
Jon:  AL, WHY, KNOWING  WHAT WE KNOW NOW, DID YOU CHOOSE  "YES" ON INVADING IRAQ.
THE CHOICES WERE A., LEAVE A  MAD MAN IN POWER WHO WILL  DESTROY WESTERN CIVILIZATION. OR B., BE A LITTLE BITCH.
Jon:  WHAT? ( LAUGHTER )
HARD TO CHOOSE B THERE, JON.
GL JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,  COULD YOU CHOOSE B. WHAT IF YOU HAD CHOSEN NOT TO  INVADE?
A VIDEO OF GEORGE W. BUSH  COMES UP AND TELLS YOU THAT YOU  MADE THE WRONG DECISION. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU'RE MAKING THAT  UP, RIGHT?
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S ACTUALLY  WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GEORGE W. BUSH MUSEUM. ( LAUGHTER ). FOR REAL.
Jon:  SO WHAT ELSE IS IN  THE THEATER?
IT'S MOSTLY GRISTLE.
Jon:  WE'LL WORK ON THAT  NEXT TIME. SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THANK YOU. ( LAUGHTER )
TAKE YOUR TIME. LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW THE  HEIMLICH. NOT THAT YOU'RE HERE, I'M JUST  SAYING IF YOU WERE HERE, I DON'T  KNOW THE HEIMLICH. I CAN'T SEND ANYBODY TO WHEREVER  IT IS THAT YOU ARE THAT WE WOULD  SEND SOMEBODY IF YOU CHOCKED ON THE STEAK WHERE ARE YOU  CLEARLY-- JUST ( BLEEP ) GO. JUST GO. ( LAUGHTER )
WELL, JON, YOU REMEMBER THAT  TIME HE GROPED ANGELA MERKEL AT  THE G-8 SUMMIT.
Jon:  GEORGE, I REMEMBER  THAT?
THAT WAS A BIG EMBARRASSMENT,  RIGHT?
Jon:  YES.
IT TURNS OUT IF YOU COMIEWZ  NOT TO DO THAT, ANGELA MERKEL  HAS A FATAL PANIC ATTACK AND  DIES.
Jon:  SO THE-- SHEIDIZE  FROM A PANIC ATTACK. DOES THAT EVEN HAPPEN? IS THAT EVEN A THING?
TELL THAT TO THE GAME, JON. PANIC ATTACKS ARE FATAL FOR  GERMAN LADIES, AND THE ONLY WAY  IS TO SHOW THEM HOW WE RELAX IN "HEY GIRL."  THERE'S A DECISION POINTS ROOM  AT THE CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL  LIBRARY GLI DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST A  CROTCH-LEVEL HOLE IN THE WALL. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  SO THEN YOU-- YOU  DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO... TO  PUT YOUR--
YEAH, EXACTLY. AND I HAVE TO ADMIT-- I GET IT  NOW.
Jon:  ALL RIGHT, THANK  YOU VERY MUCH, AL. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING  HERE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). WE'LL BE RIGHT
