[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT SPENT FIVE YEARS AS CORRESPONDENT FOR RT, RUSSIA TODAY. PLEASE WELCOME SARA FIRTH. HELLO. NICE TO SEE YOU. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SO, SO YOU WORKED, YOU JUST RECENTLY LEFT THIS... IT'S CALLED R.T., RUSSIA TODAY.
YES.
Jon: YOU'D BEEN THERE FIVE YEARS.
I HAD, YES.
Jon: WHY, WHY DID YOU JUST LEAVE?
IT HAD BEEN A REALLY LONG TIME COMING. BUT WE'D BEEN COVERING SOME BIG STORIES, WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A COMPLETELY WRONG WAY, AND I'D SEEN IT HAPPENING FROM THE INSIDE, AND I COULD SEE IT HAPPENING AGAIN WITH THE MH17 COVERAGE, SO I CALLED TIME ON IT.
Jon: AND YOU LEFT.
YEAH.
Jon: YOUR FEELING OF THE WRONG WAY, YOU FELT THAT THE KREMLIN WAS INTERFERING TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU NO LONGER FELT THAT YOU HAD THE INDEPENDENCE?
YES. I THINK WHAT R.T. DOES IS IT VERY MUCH MIRRORS THE KREMLIN LINE, SO, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER THEY'RE PUTTING OUT, WE'RE KIND OF THE SHIELDS FOR THOSE LIES BASICALLY.
Jon: HOW INVOLVED IS THE KREMLIN? LIKE EVERY NOW AND AGAIN A PHONE CALL? ARE THERE SERIOUS DIRECT E-MAILS DIRECTLY FROM THE KREMLIN? OR NO?
WE, I CERTAINLY NEVER SAW THE MESSAGES COMING FROM THE KREMLIN.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU GET THERE'S THIS SORT OF... WE JOKINGLY NICKNAMED IT THE MINISTRY OF FEAR, BUT IT'S THE KIND OF EDITORIAL BODY AT THE HEART OF THE CHANNEL, AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO KIND OF GIVE THE DIRECTIVES. AND THOSE ARE VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT THE KREMLIN LINE IS AT THE TIME, SO YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH TRACK WHAT R.T. IS SAYING TO WHAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS SAYING, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY STICK VERY STRONGLY TO THAT LINE, AS WELL.
Jon: SO IN SYRIA, THEIR LINE WOULD BE, WE HAVE TO SUPPORT ASSAD. THESE REBELS ARE BAD PEOPLE. YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HELP THEM IN ANY WAY. IN MH17, IT WOULD BE, NO THIS WAS UKRAINE. THERE'S BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT.
YEAH, IT'S ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, AS I SAID AT THE TIME I RESIGNED THAT THE SORT OF DEFAULT SETTING ON STORIES LIKE THAT IS IT IS NOT RUSSIA'S FAULT, SO...
Jon: RIGHT.
EVEN WHEN IT CLEARLY IS.
Jon: IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY, TRUTH IS ALL THAT MATTERS TO OUR NEWS NETWORKS. [LAUGHTER] AND SO TO SEE YOU STRUGGLE WITH THAT, IT REALLY SHOWS ME JUST HOW DIFFERENT RUSSIA IS. IS THAT, IS IT SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE YOU STARTED, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A CERTAIN IDEALISM, WERE YOU SURPRISED BY IT? BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES, THE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURES NEWS ORGANIZATIONS CONSISTENTLY. THERE ARE METHODS OF INTIMIDATION, MAYBE SUBTLE, THAT THEY USE. THERE ARE NEWS NETWORKS THAT WE HAVE THAT JUST PROMOTE THEIR OWN AGENDA, AND IF TRUTH HAPPENS TO BE PART OF IT, GEE, WHAT A, WHAT A NICE BONUS.
I KNOW, BUT JON, I THINK... I STILL REALLY BELIEVE, AND I THINK MAYBE THAT IS IDEALISTIC, TOO, BUT I THINK THAT'S WRONG. AND YOU KNOW, OF COURSE I'M, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GET INTO THESE THINGS WITH YOUR EYES OPEN. IT'S NOT THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THERE ARE...YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT BLACK AND WHITE. THERE ARE A MILLION SHADES OF GRAY WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY COMPLEX SITUATIONS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD, BUT THERE IS STILL A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TRUTH AND A LIE. AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD EVER, EVER WORK TO AN AGENDA THAT'S COUNTER COMPLETELY TO THE TRUTH. SO PERSPECTIVE IS GREAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE MORE PEOPLE YOU CAN HAVE OUT THERE ON THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE GIVING THEIR OPINIONS AND TELLING DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE STORY AND GETTING INTO UNDER-REPORTED STORIES, AND THAT'S WONDERFUL, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS STILL THE TRUTH, AND I THINK YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM HERE. WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET THE FACTS OF THE SITUATION, AND I JUST THINK SORT OF POINTING FINGERS IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND MISLEADING. IT CONFUSES US ALL. AND, YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS HARD. IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO FACE UP TO A LOT OF THE TIME.
Jon: RIGHT. SO YOU'RE GOING TO I GUESS LEAVE THE NEWS BUSINESS THEN. [LAUGHTER]
WELL...
Jon: IS THERE A PLACE THAT YOU ADMIRE? IS THERE PLACE THAT YOU FEEL LIKE IS DOING IT RIGHT? OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS MENTALITY OF PROPAGANDA HAS DISSIPATED, HAS GONE INTO ALL FACTIONS OF NEWS? IS IT, IS IT AN EYE-OPENING EXPERIENCE THAT MAKES YOU CYNICAL? ARE YOU HOPEFUL? WHAT'S YOUR...
IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO BE CYNICAL. >>Jon: YES.
BUT, BUT I'M, YOU KNOW, I'M A HUGE FAN OF NEW FORMS OF USING THE MEDIA. I LOVE BEING ONLINE ON YOUTUBE AND I OFTEN DO MY VIDEO REPORTS ON THERE AND TWITTER. SO, YOU KNOW WHAT, NO, I THINK THERE ARE A MILLION MORE WAYS THESE DAYS THAT WE CAN LOSE CONTEXT WITH A STORY AND WE'RE ALL CHASING SEXY SOUND BITES AND WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR THAT BIG SCOOP AND TO GAIN ATTENTION, AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SO MANY MORE WAYS TO DO THAT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S ALL THESE WAYS THAT WE CAN ALL BE INVOLVED AND GET THE TRUTH OUT THERE, AS WELL.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO I DEFINITELY FEEL OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE BECOMING REALLY DISCERNING. AND THAT'S WHAT I FOUND VERY REASSURING ABOUT R.T. IS THAT A LOT OF THE TIME WE WERE VERY OPENLY BEING CALLED ON WHAT WE WERE DOING WRONG. AND THAT CERTAINLY GAVE ME THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND, YOU KNOW, THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THAT AND SAY THAT, YEAH, IT WAS WRONG. SO I THINK...
Jon: WELL LISTEN, I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE SPIRIT OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS I'M SOON GOING TO BE ACQUIRING A NEWS NETWORK. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] I JUST RECENTLY SET OUT THE MONEY FOR IT, AND I WILL BE LOOKING FOR SOME PEOPLE. I LIKE THE CUT OF YOUR JIB. I LIKE THE OPTIMISM THAT YOU EXPRESS. I'D HATE TO RUIN YOU BY PUTTING YOU AT CNN, BUT STILL... [LAUGHTER] WHAT DO YOU THINK? ARE YOU IN?
I'LL PUT $5 TOWARDS THAT PROJECT.
Jon: YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. SARA FIRTH. GOOD LUCK IN THE FUTURE AND CONTINUE THE GOOD REPORTING. IF YOU GET A CHANCE, SHE'S FILED SOME TREMENDOUS REPORTS FROM SYRIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND I WISH YOU THE BEST. I HOPE THAT IT WORKS OUT. SARA FIRTH, EVERYBODY.
