Jon: WELCOME BACK. WILL JOHN OLVER ACTUALLY MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO AFRICA? YEAH, HE DOES. HERE'S THE REST OF HIS REPORT.
WHEN WE LEFT OFF THE U.S. HAD SENT A MESSAGE TO UNESCO CUTTING OFF THEIR FUNDING. [BLEEP] GABON STOPPED STUCK THEIR $2 MILLION WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG. ENRAJD, I TRAVELED TO GABON. [BLEEP] GABON TO CONFRONT THE TYRANNICAL PHILANTHROPISTS [BLEEP] FACE-TO-FACE.
THIS IS BULL [BLEEP].
I MET WITH THE PRESS SECRETARY TO TELL THEM THAT LITTLE COUNTRIES LIKE  AMERICA WERE TIRED OF BEING PUSHED AROUND BY INTERNATIONAL HEAVIES LIKE GABON.
GOT ANYTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELF.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT.
I'M SORRY, I JUST PRESUMED YOU WERE GOING TO APOLOGISE.
WHY?
WHY? 2 MILLION REASONS WHY. THIS IS CLASSIC GABONESE IMPERIALISM.
WHEN GABON GIVES $2 MILLION T DOESN'T JUST GO TO UNES COULD PROJECTS IN  AFRICA BUT AROUND THE WORLD.
WAIT A MINUTE, I GET IT, THIS 2 MILLION DONATION IS JUST A NIGERIAN PRINCE E-MAIL SCAM, ISN'T IT SURE, UNESCO JUST NEEDS TO WIRE YOU $10 MILLION AND YOU WILL GIVE THEM $2 MILLION BACK. THAT'S SMART, YOU KNOW. WE'LL SEND IT RIGHT BACK.
WE GAVE FROM THE HEART. WITH OUR MODEST MEANS WE DONATE $2 MILLION TO UNESCO. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? CONGRESSMAN WECHSLER, A LITTLE HELP HERE.
THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT TROUBLES THE ENTIRE WORLD.
THAT'S GOOD.
UNFORTUNATELY.
I WILL WAIT SOME OF THIS DOWN. IF UNESCO GOES AHEAD AND ADMITS THE PALESTINIANS, WE CAN'T PROVIDE FUNDING. THIS LAW HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 1990.
THAT'S A GOOD POINT THAT LOOKS GOOD WRITTEN DOWN AS WELL.
NOW I JUST HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT TO SOME UNESCO PROJECTS. ONCE UPON A TIME 20 YEARS AGO THERE WAS A U.S. CONGRESSMAN LAW THAT OUTLAWED FUNDING TO ANY U.N. ORGANIZATION THAT ALLOWED PALESTINE TO BE A MEMBER. AND THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE BOOKS ANY MORE. IT WASN'T THAT HARD A CONCEPT TO UNDERSTAND.
YES, YES, GIVE ME THE BOOKS. GIVE ME THE BOOKS. THE BOOK, GIVE ME THE BOOKS. BUT STRANGELY, SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DIDN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT.
JUST REMIND ME WHY CUTTING OFF UNESCO'S FUNDING IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT'S  STARTING TO FEEL REALLY BAD.
IT ISN'T, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR-- YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR FOCUS ON THE  BIG PICTURE.
BIG PICTURE.
THE BIG PICTURE WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW.
RIGHT.
WAS TO ENCOURAGE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ISRAELIS AND THE PALESTINIANS TO REACH A JUST  AND COMPREHENSIVE PEACE. THAT EAT BIG PICTURE. YOU HAVE TO THINK BIG PICTURE. YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT. ISRAEL AND PALESTINE MUST NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY FOR PEACE OTHERWISE IF JUST DOESN'T COUNT. U.S. IS A NATION OF LAWS.
THIS WAS PROVING TO BE TRICKY. BUT REALLY, IT WAS SO SIMPLE.
THE LAW IS THE LAW. CONCRETE, THE LAW.
THAT'S IT.
AND GUESS WHAT, AMERICA JUST CAN'T UNDO OUR LAWS LIKE THAT.
THE LAW IS CONCRETE.
NO EXCEPTIONS.
EXACTLY. NO EXCEPTIONS. NOT EVEN FOR A COLLEGE ALSO FACING THE LOSS OF CRITICAL UNESCO FUNDING.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE. AMERICA CANNOT CHANGE ITS LAWS.
WHY CAN'T YOU CHANGE IT.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
ITS ACTUALLY MADE PERFECT SENSE WHEN I WAS BACK IN THE UNITED STATES.
SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO THIS WOMAN THAT OUR LAWS CAN'T BE CHANGED.
NO, CONGRESS COULD OVERTURN THIS LAW IF IT WISHED.
WAIT, WHAT?
OF COURSE IT COULD. THEY COULD VOTE TODAY TO OVERTURN THIS LAW.
RIGHT. WE COULD DO IT EASILY.
YES. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE DICKS.
NO, I THINK --
NO.
I THINK WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT --
HOW DID I GET TO THAT CONCLUSION. HELP ME CONGRESSMAN WECHSLER, YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.
WE DIDN'T CREATE THIS PROBLEM.
THAT'S THE HEADLINE. WE DIDN'T CREATE THIS PROBLEM.
ALTHOUGH WE DID CREATE THE LAW.
ALTHOUGH WE DID CREATE THE LAW, RIGHT. [BLEEP] GOT ME CONFUSED AGAIN.
WE'RE ITS GOOD GUYS.
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS HERE. WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS HERE.
DON'T FORGET THAT.
I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET THAT. WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS.
FOR SURE.
FOR SURE.
YES. AND WHEN THOSE PROGRAMS ARE GETTING SHUT DOWN, WE STILL FEEL LIKE THE GOOD GUYS BECAUSE --
WE ARE.
WE ARE. BECAUSE WE ARE. IT IS JUST THAT SIMPLE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS. DON'T LAUGH THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS THE BACKBONE OF THE U.S. FOREIGN POLICY. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IS A TRICKY POINT TO MAKE WHEN YOU'VE GOT THESE LITTLE  FACES STARING AT YOU.
CAN YOU PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT ME. I CAN'T-- I CAN'T THINK. THAT'S BETTER. THAT'S ACTUALLY BETTER. YEAH, THAT IS BETTER. UNFORTUNATELY, ON ONE HAND, YOU ARE THE VICTIMS OF THAT SITUATION. POSITIVE SIDE, WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE AND THAT MESSAGE IS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO  COVER YOUR EYES BECAUSE IT IS-- OH, GOD. FINALLY, THEY WERE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND. WE SHOULD ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING, AMERICA. WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THAT HAS TO STOP.
BECAUSE WE JUST ARE.
STOP IT.
Jon: JOHN OLVER, LADIES AN GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: UNBELIEVABLE. SO I MEAN, AS YOU WATCH THIS, IT SEEMS LIKE THE REAL LOSER IS THE UNITED STATES.
WELL, AND OBVIOUSLY PALESTINE.
Jon: RIGHT. AND OF COURSE AFRICA, AND CHILDREN.
CHILDREN TOO, AND OF COURSE ALL THE OTHER NATIONS THAT UNESCO DOES WORK IN  WHICH IS BASICALLY EVERYWHERE.
Jon: SO IT IS AN UNUSUAL STORY BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN THERE ARE THIS MANY LOSERS  IN A STORY SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IS WINNING.
THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING. NOT HERE, JOHN. THE W COLUMN IN THIS STORY IS VACANT.
Jon: UNUSUAL, YOU WOULD THINK MATHEMATICALLY THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE  SO MANY PEOPLE LOSS WOING SOME KIND OF WINNER.
TRUE, BUT IT'S NOT THAT WE NOT AWARE OF THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS, JON. WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP. IT'S JUST WE CAN'T. EVEN THOUGH WE CAN. BUT THE LAW SAYS THAT WE SHOULDN'T. WE WOULD LOVE TO CHANGE THAT LAW, BUT WE CAN'T, EXCEPT WE CAN. IT'S JUST THAT WE DON'T WANT TO, EXCEPT WE DO, IT'S JUST  THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO. BUT IT'S NOT THAT BAD A SITUATION, APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT REALLY IS.
Jon: BUT, BUT, WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS.
OH, ALWAYS, JON. ALWAYS.
Jon: THANK YOU, JOHN, JOHN OLVER, EVERYBODY.
