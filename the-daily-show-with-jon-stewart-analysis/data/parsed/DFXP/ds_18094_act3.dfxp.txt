WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE HAVE A  NEW FILM. IRON MAN 3.
WORKING ON IT, SIR. THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: ROBERT DOWNEY, Jr. WE LOVE YOU! ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: SO... SO. Jon: I HOPE THIS WORKS OUT  FOR YOU.
THANKS, JON. I'M PLUGGING AWAY.
Jon: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. THIS PHENOMENON.
RIGHT. Jon: IS INSANITY. IT'S WORLDWIDE INSANITY.
YES. I SHOULD COME OUT RIGHT NOW.
Jon: IT WOULD BE DRAMATIC. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). PEOPLE ARE SHAKING WITH  EXCITEMENT AND GLEE.
RIGHT. I MEAN, I FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT,  YOU KNOW, THE MOVIES THAT I WAS  REALLY INTO GROWING UP. I LOVE THE ENTHUSIASM.
Jon: WERE YOU A SUPER HERO  GUY GROWING UP? YOUR FATHER WAS A DIRECTOR SO  YOU WERE INVOLVED IN FILM.
I MEAN I WAS AROUND MOVIES  OUGHT TIME. THEY WERE UNDERGROUND MOVIES. VERY COOL STUFF. BUT I MEAN I REMEMBER WHEN I SAW  THE FIRST SUPERMAN MOVIE WITH  CHRISTOPHER REEVE, IT'S FUN.
Jon: YOU BELIEVED A MAN COULD  FLY?
WELL, NO. I MEAN, BECAUSE THE EFFECTS  WEREN'T VERY GOOD BACK THEN.
Jon: THE EFFECTS IN THIS ARE  REALLY RIDICULOUS. THIS IS THE THING WITH... DO YOU  REMEMBER, OKAY, SO THE FIRST  THREE STAR WARS MOVIES. YOU'RE LIKE THESE ARE EXCELLENT  MOVIES. THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN  SCIENCE FICTION. THEN YOU SEE THE NEXT THREE  WHERE THE LEVEL OF SPECIAL  EFFECTS HAVE GOTTEN SO GREAT.
RIGHT. Jon: BUT THEY'RE PREQUELS TO  THE OTHER ONES WHICH LIKE OLD  TIMEY TALKEES. AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT TO AN  EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.
RIGHT. Jon: THIS DOESN'T SUFFER FROM  THAT.
NOT YET. Jon: ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP  GOING. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
I DON'T KNOW. Jon: THEY DON'T TELL YOU? YOU HAVE TO SIGN... DON'T THEY  MAKE YOU SIGN LIKE YOU'RE  INVOLVED NOW FOR 12 OF THESE?
NO. I MEAN I HAD A LONG CONTRACT  WITH THEM. NOW WE'RE GOING TO RENEGOTIATE.
Jon: REALLY? YOU ARE IRON MAN. YOU ARE! IN THIS ONE IT'S THE MANDARIN.
YES. Jon: THE MANDARIN IS A  CLASSIC. THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BRINGING  BACK THE MANDARIN, THIS IS FROM  A BILLING FROM WHEN I WAS A KID IN THE '60s AND ALL THOSE OLD  CARTOONS. IS THE THOUGHT PROCESS TO  REINTRODUCE SOME OF THOSE  CLASSIC VILLAINS NOW?
I GUESS SO. I MEAN KEVIN, WHO IS THE  PRESIDENT OF MARVEL, IS REALLY  THE GUY WHO HAD THE VISION. HE'S A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW BY  THE WAY. I'M GOING TO BRING HIM THE  BASEBALL CAP. I REMEMBER IN THE FIRST IRON MAN  WE GOT TO USE MANDARIN. HE WAS LIKE HOLD ON. THE SECOND TIME I'M LIKE  MANDARIN. HE SAID, NO, WE HAVE MICKEY  ROURKE. RELAX. AND THEN IN AN VENGERS I WAS  LIKE CLEARLY FOR ALL OF US. HE WAS LIKE DON'T WORRY ABOUT  IT. IT'S JUST BROTHER. AND FORTUNATELY THIS TIME WE  HAVE SIR BEN KINGSLEY. I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT TIME  AND THE RIGHT GUY TO PLAY THIS  PART. THE WHOLE THING IS JUST MAGICAL,  JON.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). I THINK THERE IS A MOVIE  PROMOTION SUIT THAT YOU GET  INTO. YOU GO LIKE THIS AND IT JUST  GOATS (MAKING NOISE). YOU JET OFF TO THE OTHER THING. NOW ARE THEY STILL PUTTING YOU  IN DANGER? ARE YOU TOO VALUABLE NOW TO THE  FRANCHISE TO BE SUSPENDED FROM  WIRES? ARE THERE PEOPLE NOW THAT THEY  MUST... WHAT IS YOUR...
YOU'RE REALLY ON TO  SOMETHING, AREN'T YOU?
Jon: I REALLY AM ON TO  SOMETHING.
I LIKE DOING THAT STUFF, YOU  KNOW. ONCE IN A WHILE YOU TAKE A SPILL  OR, YOU KNOW, YOU SHUT DOWN  PRODUCTION FOR A BIT WHILE YOU HEAL UP.
Jon: SURE. I'M THE SAME. I DO ALL MY OWN...
REALLY? Jon: LOOK HOW CLOSE YOU ARE  TO THE EDGE. THERE ARE MANY TIMES I JUST ROLL  OFF THE BACK.
NO PADS, NO BACK PAD. Jon: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LOOK AT ME. I'M 150 POUNDS OF OSTEOPOROSIS. I CAN HANDLE IT. WHAT COUNTRIES MOST LIKE IF YOU  WENT ANYWHERE, WHO IS THE MOST  WHACKED OUT ABOUT THIS? WHO IS THE MOST...
KOREA WAS AMAZING. CHINA WAS MIND BLOWING. I HAD A BALL.
Jon: ANY PLACE WHERE YOU'VE  BEEN STUNNED THAT THEY GET IT,  THAT THEY SEE IT, THAT THEY...
I MEAN HONESTLY I WAS  REALLY... I WAS HUMBLED THIS  TIME JUST BECAUSE THE FANS FOR THIS FRANCHISE, THEY'RE REALLY  ARTISTIC TOO. SO THEY GIVE ME LIKE PAINTED  HELMETS AND SOMETIMES THEY WEEP. YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I'M 48 YEARS  OLD. I'M LOOKING AT THE BACK NINE. I GET TO FEEL LIKE A BEATLE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
Jon: THAT'S NICE. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE 48 YEARS OLD.
YES, SIR. Jon: YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE  LOOKING AT THE BACK NINE? BECAUSE I'M 50. AND I'M HEADING TO THE 19th  HOLE. I GOT MAYBE THREE OR FOUR GOOD  HOLES LEFT IN ME. YOU THINK YOU GOT ANOTHER NINE  COMING HERE?
WELL, I MEAN, I BELIEVE IN  SCIENCE.
Jon: (LAUGHING). IF YOU FIND SOMETHING OUT.
RIGHT. Jon: I BEG OF YOU. SURE. Jon: CALL ME. BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY  THROUGH. I'M THE SAME AS YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY THROUGH.
OPTIMISM IS KEY. Jon: ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC? HERE'S WHAT I HEARD.
THIS WAS A DISCUSSION BETWEEN  A RUSSIAN MILITARY GUY AND CHUCK  MISSLER WHO IS A CRISTIAN... I LOVE CHUCK MISSLER. HE ASKED THE RUSSIAN GUY IS  THERE HOPE FOR WESTERN  CIVILIZATION IN THE RUSSIAN GUY SAID YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A OPTIMIST  AND A PESSIMIST. THE OPTIMIST BELIEVES THE FUTURE  IS UNCERTAIN. THE PESSIMIST IS ALWAYS RIGHT. SO IT'S OUR DUTY TO BE OPTIMISTS  BUT CLEARLY THE PESSIMIST HAS  MORE INFORMATION.
Jon: BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS  RIGHT.
I WOULD RATHER HAVE LESS  INFORMATION.
Jon: MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT  THAT, YOU SAID THE WORD DUTY. IRON MAN 3. JUST A COUPLE OF OLD GUYS  TALKING.
