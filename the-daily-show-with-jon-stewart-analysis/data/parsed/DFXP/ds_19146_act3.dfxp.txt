Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS A FOREIGN AFFAIRS JOURNALIST. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED "CITY OF LIES: LOVE, SEX, DEATH AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN TEHRAN." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW RAMITA NAVAI. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: LOOK AT THIS HERE. WE'VE GOT THERE  "CITY OF LIES: LOVE, SEX, DEATH AND THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN TEHRAN." AREN'T ALL CITIES, AND I LIVE IN NEW YORK, I'VE LIVED HERE FOR A LONG TIME, AREN'T ALL CITIES -- ISN'T THAT WHY WE COME TO CITIES, BECAUSE THEY'RE FILLED WITH LIES?
YES, IT'S TRUE, BUT LYING TAKES ON A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL IN TEHRAN. AND BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE IS OPPRESSIVE, BECAUSE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN LIVING FOR 30 YEARS UNDER A FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC REGIME, EVERYTHING IS MUCH MORE EXAGGERATED.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO LIES, JUST EVERY DAY, AND THEY'RE FILTERED INTO SOCIETY. AND THEY'RE FILTERED INTO EVERYDAY LIFE IN A WAY THAT THEY DON'T HERE.
Jon: NOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE EACH, SO YOU LAY IT OUT IN TERMS OF THESE INCREDIBLY FASCINATING PROFILES OF INDIVIDUALS. NOW, THIS COUNTRY DOES -- YOU KNOW, THERE STILL IS THAT PUSH AND PULL BETWEEN LIBERALISM AND CONSERVATISM, SECULARISM AND RELIGION, HEDONISM AND ABSTINENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, AS WELL. IT'S INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT HAVING THAT GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CHANGED THAT IN IRAN.
YES. AND I THINK WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WITH THE BOOK IS, YOU'RE RIGHT. SO, THERE ARE THESE TWO VERY SEPARATE WORLDS. AND IN TEHRAN ITSELF, IT'S QUITE GEOGRAPHIC, AS WELL. KIND OF NORTH IS LIBERAL, RICH, KIND OF MORE SECULAR. SOUTH IS KIND OF WORKING CLASS, MUCH MORE RELIGIOUS, TRADITIONAL.
Jon: NO, WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPLIT. [LAUGHTER] GO AHEAD.
BUT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO IS SHOW THE NUANCES AND THE LAYERS, AS WELL. THAT THERE AREN'T JUST THESE TWO POLAR OPPOSITES. ACTUALLY, THERE ARE ALL OF THESE REALLY COMPLEX LAYERS IN BETWEEN. IT'S REALLY GRAY.
Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IN TERMS OF HAVING TO LIE, IT'S BECAUSE IF THEY ARE TO RUN AFOUL OF THOSE MORE TRADITIONAL REGULATIONS, THERE IS REAL CONSEQUENCE TO THAT?
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY... THERE'S A LOT MORE AT STAKE. IF YOU ARE CAUGHT DRINKING, YOU MAY BE FLOGGED. IF YOU KNOW, AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, SOCIAL STRUCTURES. IT IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE AMONG MANY IRANIANS TO HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE...
Jon: SURE.
TO NOT BE A VIRGIN BEFORE MARRIAGE, SO YEAH YOU CAN GET INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LAW...
Jon: RIGHT.
AND YOU CAN BE JUDGED BY SOCIETY.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MORE POWERFUL THERE? IS IT THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OR THE SOCIETAL? WHAT DO YOU THINK CARRIES MORE SWAY IN THESE FAMILIES?
I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SOCIETY IS REALLY INTERESTING AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A CHANGE. I THINK THERE'S A SEXUAL AWAKENING GOING ON AMONG IRANIAN YOUTH, THAT, YOU KNOW, TRANSCENDS CLASS, TRANSCENDS RELIGIOUS BARRIERS AND RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AT THE MOMENT, I HAVE SEEN IT REALLY TRICKLE DOWN. SO I THINK SOCIETY IS SLOWLY CHANGING.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR PEOPLE IS GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH THE REGIME, GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.
Jon: RIGHT. IT'S NOT, IT'S NOT SO MUCH, BECAUSE THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, IF YOUR FAMILY IS VERY TRADITIONAL BUT YOU FEEL LIKE THERE MIGHT BE MORE UNDERSTANDING THERE, BUT THE LAW REALLY IS A MONOLITH AND HAS NO FLEXIBILITY.
NO. UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY. SO I'VE MET PEOPLE WHO HAVE BOUGHT THEIR FLOGS. SO YOU CAN PAY TO GET OUT OF GETTING FLOGGED.
Jon: YOU CAN PAY TO GET OUT OF GETTING FLOGGED?
YES, AND ALSO, YOU CAN ACTUALLY PAY SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE YOUR FLOG FOR YOU.
Jon: SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
SO OUTSIDE COURTHOUSES WHERE YOU GET FLOGGED, THERE ARE POOR SOULS HANGING AROUND OFFERING TO BE FLOGGED INSTEAD OF YOU? AND THEY ARE IN CAHOOTS WITH THE FLOGGER USUALLY. SO THEY GO HALF-HALF ON THE MONEY.
Jon: THE FLOGEE AND THE FLOGGER...
YEAH.
Jon IF WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS TRUE...
YES.
Jon: AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS TRUE...
YES.
Jon: YOU'RE SAYING IN TEHRAN, IN IRAN, THERE IS A DIFFERENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM FOR RICH PEOPLE AND POOR PEOPLE. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AS AN AMERICAN, AS AN AMERICAN, I MUST STAND UP AND SAY, HOW CAN THEY ALLOW THIS?
WE ARE SO SIMILAR.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT...
I KNOW.
Jon: IT'S SO INTERESTING. YOU KNOW, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY ARE ANALOGOUS AND CERTAINLY FLOGGING, BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE IS A CONTINUUM WITHIN THESE GOVERNMENTS WHERE, YOU KNOW, NO ONE IS CLEAN. YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENTS AND PEOPLES ARE ALWAYS IN THIS TITANIC STRUGGLE BETWEEN SORT OF THE FREEDOMS AND THE AUTHORITY, AND MAYBE IT'S JUST MORE STARKLY DELINEATED IN IRAN.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: I MEAN, THE STORIES ARE BEAUTIFUL, AND THEY'RE SO WELL DETAILED AND THEY'RE SO NUANCED, WHERE DOES IT GO? YOU KNOW, IN AMERICA WE TRIED BANNING ALCOHOL FOR 13 YEARS. AND AFTER 13 YEARS WE WERE LIKE, I NEED A SHOT. LIKE THEY COULDN'T... WHERE DO YOU SEE THE PRESSURE THEN COMING FROM HERE? IS IT A GENERATIONAL CHANGE THAT OCCURS?
I THINK IT WILL BE A GENERATIONAL CHANGE. I THINK SOCIALLY THINGS ARE CHANGING. I THINK CULTURALLY IT'S BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH. IT'S JUST A POWER PLAY REALLY BETWEEN THE HARDLINERS AND THE REFORMISTS OR AT THE MOMENT PRESIDENT ROUHANI.
Jon: RIGHT.
CULTURALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY'LL LOOSEN SOCIAL STURCTURES. THEY'RE VERY SMART, AS WELL. SO THEY'LL KIND OF LIFT THE POT, THEY'LL LIFT THE LID OFF THE BOILING POT. LET OFF A BIT OF STEAM, AND AGAIN THEY'LL PULL BACK ON THE REINS. BUT I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH IRAN REGARDING CHANGE IS THAT IRANIANS HAVE REALLY CHANGED FROM FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT CHANGE IN THEIR COUNTRY AND THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRIES AROUND THEM. THEY'VE SEEN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN. THEY'RE LOOKING AT SYRIA NOW. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN IRAN, THEY WERE MUCH MORE PRO BIG CHANGE.
Jon: RIGHT, REVOLUTION.
SOME IRANIANS, YEAH, REVOLUTION, PROTESTS, SOME IRANIANS WOULD EVEN TALK ABOUT WESTERN INTERVENTION. NOW THEY'RE REALLY UNIFIED IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE RESIGNED TO ANY CHANGE, THE FACT THAT ANY CHANGE WILL BE SLOW AND THEY FEEL THAT CHANGE SHOULD COME FROM WITHIN. THOSE REALLY FEAR A BLOOD BATH.
Jon: RIGH, WELL, CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE TO, YOU KNOW, TO BACK THAT UP. IS THAT AN OPEN CONVERSATION THAT TAKES PLACE IN IRAN, OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S MORE OF A STREET LEVEL CONVERSATION?
STREET-LEVEL CONVERSATION.
Jon: I SEE.
YEAH. SO YEAH, IN IRAN, THERE ARE... THIS IS ANOTHER, YOU KNOW, CITY OF LIES. YOU HAVE YOUR RED LINES, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THE RED LINE IS. AND THEY'RE MOVEABLE, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP WITHIN THE RED LINES, AS A JOURNALIST AND AS AN ORDINARY CITIZEN. AND ALSO YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TWO SELVES. YOU HAVE YOUR PRIVATE SELF AND YOUR PUBLIC SELF. SO YOU'RE VERY DIFFERENT IN YOU OWN ROOM BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AS YOU ARE IN PUBLIC.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY. YOU'RE TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. IT CAN BE QUITE A SCHIZOPHRENIC SOCIETY.
Jon: WELL, THE ONLY ADVICE I WOULD GIVE TO IRAN IS, WITH YOUR PRIVATE SELF, DON'T PUT IT ON THE CLOUD BECAUSE... [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] "CITY OF LIES" ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. RAMITA NAVAI. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
