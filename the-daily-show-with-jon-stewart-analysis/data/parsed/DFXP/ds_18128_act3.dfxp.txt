PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW THE WONDERFUL SARAH  VOWELL. (APPLAUSE)  SARAH.
LOOK AT THESE SWEATY  PEOPLE.
YES.
THANK YOU FOR BRAVING THE  HEAT AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO  REWARD YOU BY TALKING ABOUT A DEAD MAN'S RHYMING COUP  LET NOVEL.
YES. SO LET'S GIVE YOU THE  BACKGROUND FOR THIS WE'RE  GOING TO DO THIS WITHOUT  BEING SAD ABOUT IT. DAVID RAKOFF WAS, YOU KNOW,  MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW WAS A  GREAT FRIEND OF THE SHOW, GREAT FRIEND OF EVERYONE HE  MET. HE'S WRITTEN, THIS IS A  FIRST NOVEL. AND IT'S RHYMING COUP LET. YOU HAVE WRITTEN BOOKS. AND NONE OF THEM RHYMED.
NONE.
I'VE READ ALMOST ALL OF  YOUR BOOKS, THERE IS HARDLY  ANY RHYMES IN IT.
AND THEY'RE POORER FOR  IT.
EXACTLY. NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP  OF DAVID RAKOFF SO LET'S  PLAY DAVID NOW.
SO WE'RE TALKING AND  TALKING AND FINALLY I SAY,  AND THE TALKING IS ALL ABOUT SEXUAL PRACTICE AND WHAT GAY  PEOPLE DO. AND I FINALLY SAY OKAY, YOU  KNOW, HIV IS TRANSMISSABLE  BY GOOD OLD-FASHIONED RED BLOODED HETERO NORM ANY  MARRIED SEX. AND HE SAYS INTO MY  TELEPHONE, KNOWING THAT IT  IS BEING RECORDED, YEAH, BUT  NOT AS MUCH. I MEAN THE VA BEGIN-- VA  GYNEA CAN TAKE A LOT OF  PIN-- THE VAGINA CAN TAKE A  LOT OF PUNISHMENT.
SO-- I REALLY MISS THAT  GUY, JON STEWART. (LAUGHTER)
OH, COME ON.
THAT MAY BE MY FAVORITE  AND THE BALANCESIEST I MISS  JON JOKE SO FAR IN THIS RUN.
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YES.
YES. (APPLAUSE)
SO THIS IS A FANTASTIC  NOVEL, RHYMING NOVEL.
YES.
IT IS FUNNY. IT IS TRAGIC. IT IS UPLIFTING.
IT HAS AT EPIC SWEEP,  GETS LIKE A HUNDRED YEARS OF  AMERICAN HISTORY.
YEAH.
AND STARTS IN THE STOCK  YARDS IN CHICAGO. HE GOES THROUGH THE  DEPRESSION IN NEW YORK IN  THE '50s, YOU KNOW, SAN  FRANCISCO IN THE WEE, GAY WHEE FREEWHEELING '70s. WELL, YOU --
THAT IS NOT HOW THEY  SOUND.
THAT IS LIKE GAY PEOPLE  ON ROLLER COASTERS. I'M ENJOYING THIS AS EXACTLY  AS MUCH AS THE SAME PERSON.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT  PART OF THE BOOK IS FUN  FILLED.
IT SURE IS. UNTIL EVERYONE GETS AIDS AND --  -- -- BUT FOR A WHILE THERE  IT'S WHEE!
THAT IS THE STORY OF SAN  FRANCISCO, ISN'T IT IT'S ALL  A LOT OF FUN UNTIL EVERYONE GETS AIDS. (LAUGHTER)
LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO UNDER  STAND SARAH AND I ARE BOTH  CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH. WE BOTH LIKE TO DISPLACE OUR  REGULAR EMOTIONS SO OUR DEEP  SADNESS AT LOSING ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL HUMAN BEINGS  AROUND IS DISPLACED INTO  MAKING JOKES AT EACH OTHER'S  EXPENSE.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?
SO THIS IS REALLY, I  CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH IT  IS WORTH NOT JUST GETTING THIS BOOK. YOU WON'T JUST ENJOY IT, YOU  WILL READ IT MORE THAN ONCE. THIS MAN KNEW HIS WAY AROUND  A WORD.
YEAH, I MEAN YOU KNOW,  AND IT'S SUCH A SLIM VOLUME  BUT HE DOES PACK THIS WHOLE CENTURY'S WORTH OF STORIES  INTO IT. AND ALL OF THESE CHARACTERS  AND KIND OF TIES THEM  TOGETHER AT THE END. AND IT'S SORT OF, IT'S  DIFFERENT FROM HIS ESSAYS. AND YET IT STILL HAS, I MEAN  HIS ESSAYS WERE SO FUNNY BUT  CODO THAT IN HIS ESSAYS AND JUST SORT OF BOIL SOMETHING  DOWN TO THE BARE BONES  FUNNIEST WAY TO DESCRIBE  SOMETHING. YOU KNOW. LIKE I REMEMBER ONCE, I MEAN  HE WAS THE MASTER OF THE  FISH OUT OF WATER STORY.
RIGHT.
PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS A  GAY JEWISH CANADIAN LIKE-- WHERE  WAS HE GOING TO FIT IN.
THAT IS-- THAT'S THREE  DIFFERENT FISH, NOWHERE NEAR  WATER.
AND HERE-- HE WAS AT THIS  BED & BREAKFAST IN NEW  ENGLAND TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE DECOR. AND HE SAID IT-- IT LOOKED  LIKE THE SORT OF PLACE THAT,  THE LOOK THAT RALPH LAURYN WOULD BURN DOWN A SYNAGOGUE  TO ACHIEVE. (LAUGHTER)  AND THERE IS SO MUCH GOING  ON IN THAT LITTLE ZINGER,  YOU KNOW.
THAT IS THE THING.
THE WAY HE WROTE, THE WAY  HE SPOKE AND THIS IS, EVEN  THE DISTILLATION EVEN FURTHER, CAN GET AN ENTIRE,  AN ENTIRE HUMAN FEELING INTO  A COUP LET, A PERFECTLY PHRASED QUICK COUP LET.
I MEAN YOU KNOW, IT IS  SAD THAT HE'S NOT HERE TO  ENJOY THIS PUBLICATION. I GUESS SOME PEOPLE WILL DO  ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF GOING  ON BOOK TOURS, BUT I MEAN, WHEN I GET ONE OF MY BOOKS,  IT'S ALWAYS SOCIAL SIGHTING. THE FIRST THING I DO IS I  TURN TO THE TITLE PAGE AND I  SEE THERE IS THE LIBRARY 6 CONGRESS CATALOGING  INFORMATION, YOU KNOW. AND THAT MEANS YOU KNOW,  IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE  LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, YOU  KNOW, IT'S MORE IMMORTALITY THAN ANYONE HAS A RIGHT TO  EXPECT. AND LIKE LIFE IS SHORT, THE  LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS  FOREVER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
UNLESS, UNLESS THOSE  BRITISH BASTARDS BURN IT  DOWN AGAIN.
OH COME ON.
LIKE THEY DID DURING THE  WAR OF 1812.
IT HAD TO GO. IT WAS STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND. YOU SHOULDN'T BUILD  BUILDINGS SO FLAMMABLE.
EVEN, YOU WERE  ALL-- BEFORE THERE WAS --
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ON  THE WEB AND MAYBE DO I A  READING. IT IS, HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL  MAN THIS SAY BEAUTIFUL BOOK. DAVID RAKOFF'S BOOK, LOVE,  DISHONOR, MARRY, DIE,  CHERISH, PERISH IS ON THE  BOOK SHELVES NOW.
