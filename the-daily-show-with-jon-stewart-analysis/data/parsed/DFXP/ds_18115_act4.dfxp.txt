John: WELCOME BACK! WE ARE HEAR WHAT THE FANTASTIC  MAVIS STAPLES. MAVIS, I LOVE THE FACT AT THE  END OF THIS SONG YOU JUST PLAYED  THERE WAS A MOMENT OF QUIET AND YOU JUST SAID "YEAH."  (LAUGHTER)  I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN  A MORE MERITED "YEAH."
I COULDN'T HELP IT, JOHN.
John: LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS  IN THE RALLY TO RESTORE SANITY  AND I WAS ADD -- DRESSED AS PETER PAN.
I TRIED TO CATCH YOU BUT I  COULDN'T CATCH YOU!
John: I ALWAYS THOUGHT I  WOULD MEET A LEGEND OF MUSIC  WEARING GREEN TIGHTS. AND MY MOST ABIDING MEMORIES ARE  STANDING IN THE WINGS WATCHING  YOU AND JEFF TWEETY SING AND REALIZING I WAS STANDING NEXT TO  ARTIE DEE TOO. THAT WAS CRAZY.
THAT WAS CRAZY AND FUN. AND YOU RAN OFF WITH DIVINE! YOU HAD THE GREEN TIGHTS ON. YOU SAID "I'M GETTING OUT OF  HERE WITH THIS VINE."  (LAUGHS)
John: SO THE NEW ALBUM IS  COMING OUT IN THE A COUPLE WEEKS  AND YOU'RE ON TOUR, CORRECT?
I'M ON TOUR. AND IT IS.
John: OH, IT'S ENGLAND. I'M SORRY. IT'S BACK ON ME, NOT ON YOU. YOU'RE ON TOUR.
YOU THREW ME THAT TIME. YOU GOT ME. BUT YES WE'RE ON TOUR. WE'RE PROMOTING OUR NEW C.D. "ONE TRUE VINE."
John: YOU CAN CATCH MAVIS AT  THE FONDER THEATER ON JUNE 26. THE ALBUM IS CALLED "ONE TRUE  VINE."
