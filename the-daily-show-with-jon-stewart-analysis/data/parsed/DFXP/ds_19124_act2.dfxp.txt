Jon: WELCOME BACK. SO, DO YOU REMEMBER A TIME, DO YOU REMEMBER A TIME WHEN BARACK OBAMA WAS BUT A NAIVE YOUNG PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, AND HE SAID WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN THE MIDWEST WERE CLINGING TO THEIR GUNS AND RELIGION. NOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PUNISHED HIM BY ELECTING HIM TO TWO TERMS AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. CAUSE THAT AIN'T FUN. WELL THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNERS FOR 2016 AREN'T GOING TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE.
I DO NOT BELIEVE OUR GREAT COUNTRY SHOULD BE PLAYING MINOR LEAGUE BALL. WE'RE THE FORCE FOR PROGRESS, PROSPERITY AND PEACE.
SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE BOOK THAT MADE HER WHO SHE IS TODAY. AND HER ANSWER WAS THE BIBLE.
Jon: OH MY GOD, DID SHE JUST THREATEN TO SMITE HER ENEMIES? HILLARY'S CLINGING TO RELIGION WHO WILL CLING TO GUNS?
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOURSELF, GET A DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN. IF THERE IS EVER A PROBLEM, JUST WALK OUT ON THE BALCONY HERE, FIRE TWO BLASTS OUTSIDE THE HOUSE. BUY A SHOT GUN. BUY A SHOTGUN. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT IS THE DUDE SITTING NEXT TO HIM LIKE, HOLY [BLEEPED]. I WANT YOU TO CALL SHOTGUN WHILE SHOTGUNNING A BEER ON THE WAY TO YOUR SHOTGUN WEDDING. THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE SHOTGUNS. SO COME ON DOWN TO CRAZY JOEY'S SHOTGUN EMPORIUM. CLEARLY THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SETTLE WHICH DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE CAN APPEAL BEST TO TRADITIONAL BLUE COLLAR REAGAN DEMOCRAT VOTERS. LOOKS LIKE WE NEED OURSELVES A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED POOR-OFF. I RECKON IT'S TIME FIND OUT WHICH OF THESE TWO IS JUST MORE PLAIN FOLK. MADAM SECRETARY...
WE CAME OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE NOT ONLY DEAD BROKE, BUT IN DEBT.
I STILL GET EMOTIONAL JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. [APPLAUSE] WELL PLAYED, MRS. CLINTON, BUT IF I KNOW JOE BIDEN, YOU JUST BROUGHT A $100 BILL TO A LOOSE CHANGE FIGHT.
HE'S VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE MAKES, NOTWITHSTANDING, HE'S LISTED AS THE POOREST MAN IN CONGRESS.
Jon: HOW POOR IS BIDEN?  CAN'T EVEN AFFORD A FIRST-PERSON PRONOUN. THAT'S HOW POOR HE IS. YOUR MOVE, MADAM SECRETARY.
WE HAD NO MONEY WHEN WE GOT THERE, AND WE STRUGGLED TO, YOU KNOW, PIECE TOGETHER THE RESOURCES FOR MORTGAGES FOR HOUSES.
Jon: YEAH, WHEN YOU'RE APPEALING TO THE MIDDLE CLASS, YOU MAY WANT TO USE THE SINGULAR WHEN REFERRING TO THE MOST VALUABLE ASSET MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER COME IN CONTACT WITH. BIDEN I SEE AN OPENING.
FOR 36 YEARS I COMMUTED FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., TO WILMINGTON ROUND TRIP EVERY DAY. DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME THAT I DON'T OWN A SINGLE STOCK OR BOND. DON'T HOLD IT, I HAVE NO SAVINGS ACCOUNT.
Jon: DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME, BUT MY CLOTHES ARE MADE OF OLD CURTAINS. [LAUGHTER] DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME, BUT I [BLEEPED] IN A BUCKET OUTSIDE. [LAUGHTER] TOP, THAT SECRETARY CLINTON. TOP IT.
THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER THE "GUARDIAN" HAD ASKED MRS. CLINTON IF SHE COULD BE A CREDIBLE CHAMPION FOR FIGHTING INCOME INEQUALITY DESPITE HER WEALTH. MRS. CLINTON SAYS, "THEY DON'T SEE ME AS PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE PAY ORDINARY INCOME TAX, UNLIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY WELL OFF, NOT TO NAME NAMES."
Jon: I THINK WE KNOW WHO SHE'S TALKING ABOUT, BECKY FROM CAMP, ALWAYS CHEATING AT DODGEBALL AND TAXES. IT'S ANOTHER BOLD ATTEMPT, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU'RE SIMPLY NO MATCH FOR JOE I'M ALLERGIC TO MONEY BIDEN, ALTHOUGH HIS I DON'T HAVE ANY STOCKS STORY DOES HAVE A BIT OF A HOLE IN IT.
WELL, ACCORDING TO DISCLOSURE FORMS, BIDEN DOES HAVE SOME MONEY IN SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS.
HIS OFFICE SAYS THE VICE PRESIDENT WAS TELLING THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE INVESTMENTS BELONG TO HIS WIFE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: HOLD ON. I'M HOMELESS. I HAPPEN TO STAY IN MANSION BELONGING TO MY LOVELY BRIDE. KIND OF LIKE THE KING OF ENGLAND. WHAT'S WITH THE POVERTY TOURETTE'S? WHY DO THESE TWO SEEM TO THINK WE NEED A HOBO FOR PRESIDENT? OWN WHAT YOU HAVE, IT'S FINE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,  WHY DO YOU THINK WE'LL BELIEVE THEM? I MEAN, BOTH OF YOU GUYS HAVE HAD YOUR FACES ON BOOK COVERS, BOOKS WRITTEN BY THEM ABOUT THEM. THAT USUALLY MEANS YOU'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD.
HIS MEMOIR "PROMISES TO KEEP," EARNED LESS THAN $201 IN ROYALTIES LAST YEAR.
Jon: ON SECOND THOUGHT, I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS GUY AFFORDS A BUCKET TO [BLEEPED] IN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
