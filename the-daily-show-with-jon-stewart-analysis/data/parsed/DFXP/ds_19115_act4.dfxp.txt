Jon: REMEMBER EARLIER, REMEMBER EARLIER, JASON JONES WAS MAKING THAT FUNNY JOKE ABOUT RIPPING HIS PANTS. YEAH, THAT WAS NO JOKE. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S AN IMPRESSIVE RIP, BY THE WAY. THAT'S THE SHOW. JOIN US TOMORROW AT 11:00. HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU DIDN'T JUST RELEASE THEM. YOU UNLEASHED THEM. AND YOU AND YOU ALONE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HELL THAT WILL BE UNLEASHED ON US.
