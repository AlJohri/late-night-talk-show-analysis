John: WELCOME BACK. JON STEWART'S GUEST TONIGHT IS ALSO HIS MUSE, HE'S THE AUTHOR OF "ROSEWATER," THE BOOK THAT INSPIRED THE MOVIE. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW, THE GREAT MAZIAR BAHARI.
I'VE BEEN UNDER THAT DESK FOR YEAR WAITING TO CLOSE THIS.
YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I WAS WONDERING. I MEAN YEAH, THERE'S WATER, THERE'S FOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
John: EVERYTHING YOU NEED.
LET'S START WITH --
John: GO.
MR. JON OLIVER, YOU'RE WELCOME. BECAUSE IF IT WAS NOT FOR MY ARREST, JON WOULD NOT MAKE THIS FILM.
John: RIGHT.
YOU WOULD NOT HOST THE SHOW AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE YOUR SHOW NOW.
John: YEAH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
John: SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS.
MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD TIME. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
John: DO I OWE AHMADINEJAD 10% OF MY FUTURE INCOME, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
AHMADINEJAD AND MR. ROSEWATER.
John: OKAY, SO THAT'S 20%. OKAY. ALRIGHT.
EXACTLY. YEAH.
John: SO, LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BACKGROUND HERE.
SURE.
John: ESPECIALLY YOUR BACKGROUND, BECAUSE YOUR FATHER WAS IMPRISONED BY THE SHAH IN THE 50s. YOUR OLDER SISTER WAS IMPRISONED BY RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI IN THE 80s.
KHOMEINI.
John: YEAH, KHOMEINI.
KHOMEINI, KHOMEINI THEY'RE LIKE -- OKAY, YEAH.
John: I'M BRITISH. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HOWEVER WE SAY IT.
EXACTLY.
John:  I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS STARTED BUT THAT'S A WHOLE BIGGER DISCUSSION. SO IS THE ABILITY TO PISS OFF IRANIAN LEADERSHIP, IS THAT A DOMINANT GENE IN YOUR FAMILY?
IT'S THE BAHARI FORTE, YES. BAHARI FORTE. WELL BASICALLY, MY FAMILY WANTS A BETTER IRAN, A MORE DEMOCRATIC IRAN.
John: RIGHT.
MY GRANDFATHER WAS ALSO A POLITICAL ACTIVIST. THEN MY FATHER WAS A POLITICAL ACTIVIST. MY SISTER. WE ALL WANT TO HAVE A BETTER IRAN. BUT, OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS HAPPY WITH THE STATUS QUO, THE GOVERNMENT THAT WANTS TO RAPE AND PILLAGE THE NATIONAL RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY, DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF CHANGE. SO MY FATHER SUFFERED IN THE 1950s. MY SISTER SUFFERED IN THE 1980s. AND I, OF COURSE, WENT TO JAIL IN 2009.
John: SO DID YOU WALK AWAY FROM THAT INTERVIEW THINKING THAT WAS FUN. THAT WAS A BIT OF HARMLESS FUN. OR DID YOU THINK I WONDER IF THAT CROSSED THE LINE?
NO, IT WAS A VERY, IT WAS A VERY INNOCENT INTERVIEW.
John: RIGHT.
AFTER COMING OUT OF THAT INTERVIEW, I DID NOT THINK THAT JON STEWART WOULD MAKE A FILM STARRING GAEL GARCIA BERNAL. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN INTERVIEW LIKE MANY OTHER INTERVIEWS THAT I HAD DONE IN THE PAST. AND THEY HAD A SCENARIO FOR ME. THEY WANTED TO INCRIMINATE SOME REFORMIST WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN THROUGH PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WORKED WITH WESTERN ORGANIZATIONS. SO I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MEDIA CONDUIT BETWEEN THE IRANIAN REFORMISTS AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
John: RIGHT. THERE'S A POINT IN THE MOVIE WHERE THE INTERROGATOR IS TOLD BY HIS SUPERVISOR, YOU MUST NOT JUST TAKE HIS BLOOD. YOU MUST ALSO TAKE HIS HOPE.
YEAH.
John: HOW DO YOU PROTECT THAT IN THAT SITUATION? HOW DO YOU PROTECT YOUR OWN HOPE?
WHEN THEY PUT YOU IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, THEY DEPRIVE YOU OF ALL YOUR SENSES. YOU CANNOT SEE ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WALLS AROUND YOU. YOU CANNOT TOUCH ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE WALLS AROUND YOU. SO YOU HAVE TO GO INSIDE YOURSELF. SOME PEOPLE ARE RELIGIOUS, SPIRITUAL. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IRAN-- MYSELF, THEY WERE RECITING THE KORAN, BUT I'M NOT SUCH A BELIEVER SO I HAD TO FIND OTHER THINGS. I HAD TO GO THROUGH MY LIFE EXPERIENCE. MY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY LOVED ONES, MY FATHER AND MY SISTER WHO YOU SEE IN THE FILM. MY TRAVELS, THE BOOKS THAT I HAD READ, THE MUSIC THAT I HAD LISTENED TO, AND THE FILMS SO I HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT IN ORDER TO EMPOWER MYSELF. BUT ALSO WHAT EMPOWERED ME WAS THAT I KNEW ONE DAY, I WOULD COME OUT OF PRISON, AND I WOULD WRITE THAT BOOK, AND I WOULD JUST TELL THE WORLD WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN IRAN TO PEOPLE LIKE ME, BUT ALSO WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MANY THOUSANDS OF JOURNALISTS AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE EVERY DAY ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
John: I HAVE TO THROW TO A BREAK. I'M NOT USED TO DOING THAT. NORMALLY, HBO I JUST THROW TO "GAME OF THRONES." THIS TIME I HAVE TO THROW TO A TWIX COMMERCIAL, IT'S A MORE DIFFICULT CHANGE OF SPEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE BOOK IS "ROSEWATER." THE MOVIE IS "ROSEWATER." THE GREAT MAZIAR BAHARI. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH GAEL GARCIA BERNAL. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
