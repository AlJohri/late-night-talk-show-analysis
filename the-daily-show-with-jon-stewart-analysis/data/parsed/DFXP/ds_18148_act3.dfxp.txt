Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT A PULITZER PRIZE WINNING REPORTER, HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED FIVE DAYS AT MEMORIAL LIFE-AND-DEATH IN A STORM RAVAGED HOSPITAL. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM SHERI FINK. (APPLAUSE) THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THE BOOK IS CALLED FIVE DAYS AT MEMORIAL. IT INVOLVES A HOSPITAL IN NEW ORLEANS.
YES.
Jon: AFTER KATRINA IT IS PERHAPS THE DARKEST BOOK, I HAD TO READ LORD OF THE FLIES AFTER THIS TO REGAIN MY LOVE OF HUMANITY.
I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T READ MY FIRST BOOK ABOUT A HOSPITAL IN THE GENOCIDE.
Jon: IS THAT YOUR FIRST BOOK.
YEAH SO THIS IS LIGHTER. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: CAN'T YOU WRITE ABOUT JUST LIKE, I DON'T KNOW A MUMPS OUTBREAK. THIS WAS I KEPT WAITING FOR A HERO TO EMERGE IN THIS STORY AT THE HOSPITAL, WHETHER IT BE A PLANNER OR RESPONDER OR DOCTOR. AND THEY DON'T EVER SEEM TO EMERGE.
THERE'S NO ONE HERO AND THERE'S NO ONE VILLAIN HERE.
Jon: YES.
YES, AND IF I HAVE ONE THING TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS, IT IS BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING TO FAIL IN A DISASTER. AND THAT'S WHY THE BOOK LOOKS A LOT AT LIKE INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EVERYTHING FAILS. BECAUSE PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE IS ALL ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE, ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. AND THIS IS REALLY LIKE HOW CAN WE BE MORE PREPARED.
Jon: WELL, YOU WOULD THINK LIKE YOU COULD LOOK AT THIS AND THINK OH NEW ORLEANS IT'S SO CHAOTIC DOWN THERE OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT PREPARED. THE EXACT SAME THING, LIKE NO GENERATORS OR ALL LOCATED BELOW SEA LEVEL HAPPENED IN NEW YORK CITY DURING HURRICANE SANDY DOWN AT NYU.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED, EIGHT YEARS LATER. IT'S CRAZY. I MEAN I THINK THAT IN NEW ORLEANS THEY LEARNED. HOSPITALS ARE ABOUT POWER AND WATER. YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT. AND WE LOST THAT IN NEW YORK. AND IT WAS CRAZY TO SEE AFTER ALL THE LESSONS WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM KATRINA, THAT AGAIN WE'RE SEEING BABIES BEING CARRIED DOWN DARKENED STAIRCASES, SO YES WE'VE GOT INFRASTRUCTURE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S IN, YOU KNOW, TORNADO ALLEY, HOSPITALS UP TO CODE, EARTHQUAKE ZONES. YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M GOING TO BE CHECKED INTO A HOSPITAL IF I HAVE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, I WANT TO ASK. SO WE NEED TO BE ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR HOSPITALS. WE NEED TO BE ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, ABOUT REGULATIONS THAT MAYBE NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS SAID AFTER KATRINA, NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED. STILL HAVEN'T BEEN RELEASED ALL THESE YEARS LATER. SO WE HAVE MAJOR THINGS TO LEARN AND THAT'S WHY I WROTE THIS FIVE DAYS AT MEMORIAL.
Jon: IF YOU ASKED, IF I GO INTO THE HOSPITAL AND SAY TO THEM, LIKE, SO HOW'S YOUR GENERATOR SITUATION.
YES, ASK THEM.
Jon: YOU CAN'T GET SOMEONE TO SEE YOU LET ALONE TO DISCUSS, CAN I JUST SAY, LIKE THAT BIG GUY OVER THERE, IF IT ALL GOES TO HELL, CAN HE CARRY ME DOWN THE STAIRS. LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD ASK.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS HOSPITAL, TOO. THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS HEAVYSET AND THEY DECIDED WE CAN'T RESCUE HIM BECAUSE HE WEIGHS TOO MUCH. THERE IS A LOT OF OBESE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS BEFOREHAND. BUT THAT'S WHY MAYBE WE NEED REGULATIONS. BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR US TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT WE SHOULD. ARE YOUR-- YOU'RE IN A FLOOD ZONE, ARE THE GENERATORS IN THE BASEMENT?
Jon: YES THAT'S WHERE WE KEEP OUR GENERATORS, MA'AM. SO LIKE YOU COME IN AND I'M HAVING A HEART ATTACK, WHERE ARE YOUR GENERATORS, THEY'RE IN THE BASEMENT, YOU GO ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WELL WHAT'S THE WEATHER GOING TO BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS. BECAUSE I GOT-- IT TRULY  IS-- IT'S MIND-BOGGLING. AND THE THING THAT HAPPENS HERE THAT I THINK IS SO ASTONISHING AND BOY, IT'S HARD NOT TO JUDGE IT, IS SO ONE OF THE DOCTORS STARTS KILLING PEOPLE. I MEAN IF I MAY --
I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO.
Jon: HE STARTS-- HE STARTS EUTHANIZING, HE STARTS EUTHANIZING PEOPLE THINKING LIKE OH, THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.
THIS IS THE STAKES OF THE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS. IS THAT THERE WERE DECENT, HARDWORKING, WELL RESPECTED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO LITERALLY FELT LIKE THAT WAS THEIR CHOICE. NOW WAS THAT THE RIGHT CHOICE? I THINK A LOT OF US WOULD SAY NO, THERE WERE 20 PEOPLE IN THE END WHO A FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST THOUGHT RECEIVED THESE DRUGS AND DIED, 20 PEOPLE, THAT'S LIKE IN BETWEEN COLUMBINE AND YOU KNOW, THE LATEST SHOOTING, MASS SHOOTINGS IN NEWTOWN.
Jon: YOU LIVE IN A DARK, DARK PLACE.
SO I'M SAYING WE NEED PREPAREDNESS. THESE ARE THE STAKES BUT YOU KNOW, THEY FELT LIKE AT THAT POINT THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING MERCIFUL.
Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN THEY CAME OUT, EVERYBODY SORT OF, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE AT THE END OF THAT DISASTER MOVIE, THEY ALWAYS CLIMB OUT OF THE OVERTURNED SHIP TO THE SUNLIGHT. AND THEY ALL WERE LIKE THEY TOOK LIKE A VOW TO NEVER TALK ABOUT IT. AND TO SAY, AND NOTHING HAPPENED, WE WILL NEVER TALK ABOUT THIS.
THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. IT IS LIKE A CODE OF SILENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID. A DOCTOR ENDED UP GETTING ARRESTED AND ACCUSED OF HAVING KILLING THE PATIENTS. I THINK IT ALL COMES DOWN TO IN A DISASTER DO WE THINK THAT EXCEPTIONAL TIMES ARE TIMES WHEN WE-- YOU KNOW, SHOULD LET SOME OF OUR MORAL VALUES SLIP OR IS IT A TIME WHEN WE WANT TO HOLD EVEN MORE TIGHTLY TO OUR DEEPEST MORAL VALUES. AND I DON'T THINK THE DOCTORS-- .
Jon: HOLD MORE TIGHTLY, OH, DID I GIVE AWAY THE ENDING? AND THAT'S WHY HERE IS WHAT IS SO GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK, IT'S ACTUALLY FREEZE DRIED FOOD, YOU CAN EAT IT. IT IS A GENERATOR. I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S A WILD STORY. AND THIS WILL BE A MOVIE. THIS WILL BE A MOVIE AND SOMEONE WILL WIN AN OSCAR BECAUSE THEY'LL PLAY LIKE A DARK, DARK-- DARK, THIS IS-- YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BRAD PITT AND ANGELINA JOLIE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE REALLY GOOD LOOKING PEOPLE GO TO THIS DARK, DARK PLACE.
BUT LET'S LEARN FROM IT. LET'S COME OUT OF THIS TO THE LIGHT.
Jon: YES, WE SHOULD ALSO LEARN FROMS IT, BUT SHOULD GET A REALLY GOOD MOVIE OUT OF THIS. AND THEN LEARN FROM IT.
AT LEAST.
Jon: FIVE DAYS AT MEMORIAL, ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, SHERI FINK THANK YOU
