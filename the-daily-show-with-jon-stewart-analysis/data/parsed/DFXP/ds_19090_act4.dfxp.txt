Jon: THAT IS OUR SHOW. HERE IT IS YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
CRUISE OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL NOT CHANGE ONE SHIP'S ITINERARY EVEN THOUGH DOZENS OF ITS PASSENGERS HAVE GOTTEN SICK. I HOPE THAT PLANE CHANNEL DOESN'T START ANOTHER POOP CRUISE SORT OF EXTRAVAGANZA. BECAUSE HOW WILL WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLANE IF THEY GO OFF ON POOP CRUISE AGAIN?
