[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]
Jon: TOOK ABOUT THREE WEEKS  SINCE ALL OF US FOUND OUT THAT  HEALTHCARE.GOV WASN'T DOING WELL. AND BY ALL OF US I MEAN ALL OF US
KATHLEEN SEBELIUS TOLD CNN THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT  THE WEBSITE PROBLEMS UNTIL AFTER ITS TURBULENT LAUNCH.
WHEN DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A PROBLEM?
IT BECAME CLEAR FAIRLY EARLY  ON. THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS THAT --
BUT NOT BEFORE THAT THOUGH? NOT BEFORE OCTOBER 1?
Jon: YOU DIDN'T KNOW THERE  WOULD BE PROBLEMS UNTIL THE  DAY -- THIS IS YOUR SIGNATURE  PROGRAM. YOUR NAME IS ON IT. YOU'RE LIKE IF THE CHARMIN BEAR  JUST FOUND OUT WHAT PEOPLE DO  WITH HIS TOILET PAPER. YOU PUT THIS WHERE? I'VE BEEN RUBBING THIS ON MY  FACE FOR YEARS!  MAY BE A BIT CONCERNING THAT THE PRESIDENT WASN'T KEPT IN THE  LOOP ABOUT THE PROGRAM NAMED  AFTER HIM. BUT IN HIS DEFENSE, THERE APPEAR TO BE VERY FEW  LOOPS HE'S IN.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE  GOVERNMENT REVEALED THAT IT MONITORED SOME 35 WORLD  LEADERS, INCLUDING ANGELA  MERKEL. PERHAPS MORE SHOCKING IS THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT IT FOR FIVE YEARS.
Jon: WHAT? SO FOR FIVE YEARS. I ASSUME THE PRESIDENT IS BEING  PRESENTED WITH THE FINDINGS FROM THIS WORLD LEADER MONITORING. NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM IN FIVE  YEARS, HOW ARE WE GETTING THIS? DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE IN  SURVEILLANCE FAIRIES? THIS IS CRAZY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF THE  PRESIDENT WASN'T AWARE THAT WE  WERE SPYING ON OUR ALLIES, WHO  GAVE THE GO AHEAD TO SPY ON OUR  ALLIES?
AN NSA SPOKES WOMAN SAID THAT IT TAKES ORDERS FROM SOMETHING CALLED THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PRIORITIES FRAME  WORK AND NOT THE PRESIDENT.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS  THIS? [LAUGHTER] DID WE FIND OUT ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF SOME KIND OF NIPF SLIP? FOR MORE ON THE PRESIDENT'S TOTAL IGNORANCE OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING, WE GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA!  [CHEERS & APPLAUSE] HOW CAN THE PRESIDENT BE UNAWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HIM?
BECAUSE NOBODY TELLS HIM,  JON. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE  PRESIDENT IS A VERY SENSITIVE  MAN. HE DOESN'T HANDLE BAD NEWS WELL. HE'S A CRYER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: LIKE A JOHN BOEHNER  CRYER?
PLEASE, JON, THE PRESIDENT IS SO EMOTIONAL. THE GUY CRIES WHEN PEOPLE LITTER TOLD HIM TO SUCK IT UP.
Jon: WHAT ELSE HAS THE  PRESIDENT NOT BEEN TOLD?
WELL, BASICALLY ALL THE BAD  STUFF. HE THINKS GUN CONTROL PASSED AND THAT WE SHUT DOWN GUANTANAMO  THREE YEARS AGO. HE THINKS REPUBLICANS WILL  ACTUALLY WORK WITH HIM. I KNOW. I'M TELLING YOU, THE PRESIDENT  IS IN A BUBBLE.
Jon: HE'S A BUBBLE BOY.
YES. EXACTLY.
Jon: WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT  THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA BE KEPT IN  THE DARK ABOUT IT?
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO  BUM HIM OUT, JON. HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE AMERICA'S  INSPIRATION. THE FACE OF HOPE AND CHANGE. HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO GIVE THE  MOVING SPEECHES IF HE KNOWS ALL  THE TERRIBLE STUFF THAT IS  REALLY GOING ON? I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SIT  HERE AND TELL JOKES EVERY NIGHT.
Jon: I PRETEND I'M A  CHARACTER IN A MOVIE ABOUT THE  COUNTRY FALLING APART.
THANKS, JON. A GOOD TIP.
Jon: IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, HOW DOES HE RUN THE COUNTRY?
OH, JON, NO PRESIDENT HAS RUN THE COUNTRY SINCE KENNEDY. YOU HEARD WHAT THEY SAID. OUR SPYING OPERATION IS TOTALLY  UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE  NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE PRIORITIES FRAME WORK.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT. YOU COULDN'T COME UP WITH A MORE SINISTER SOUNDING ORGANIZATION.
EXACTLY.
Jon: TO SECRETLY RUN THE  COUNTRY. HOW MANY OF THEM ARE OPERATING  THROUGH THE BOWELS OF OUR  GOVERNMENT WITHOUT OUR  KNOWLEDGE?
Jon: YOU SAID BOWELS.
YES.
AND DON'T WORRY, THERE'S TWO. NIPF AND THEY'RE OVERSEEN BY THE NEW WORLD ORDER REGIONAL DIRECTORATE.
Jon: WAIT. THEY'RE OVERSEEN BY THE NEW WORLD ORDER REGIONAL DIRECTORATE?
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
Jon: WHY NOT?
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T THROW  AROUND THE N WORD. ARE YOU CRAZY?
Jon: YOU JUST SAID THE N  WORD.
HEY, JON, I CAN SAY THAT. I HAVE THE SECURITY CLEARANCE.
Jon: THANK YOU, JESSICA.
