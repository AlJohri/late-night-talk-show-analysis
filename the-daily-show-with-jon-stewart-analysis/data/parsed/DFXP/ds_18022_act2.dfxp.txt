Jon: WELCOME BACK. TUESDAY NIGHT, ELECTION  NIGHT. BIG VICTORY FOR PRESIDENT  OBAMA. FOR MORE ON THE RAMIFICATION  FOR ELECTION NIGHT WE TURN  TO JOHN OLIVER.
THANK YOU, JON, THANK  YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK EVERYONE WATCHING  TUESDAY NIGHT CAN AGREE ON  ONE THING, THE PRESIDENT [BLEEP] UP, JON. I MEAN HE [BLEEP] UP. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT'S YOUR-- WHAT  ARE YOU TELLING, HE WAS  RE-ELECTED.
EXACTLY. YOU THINK HE WAS EXPECTING  THAT? OF COURSE NOT. 16 TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. 7.9% UNEMPLOYMENT, I'M SURE  HE WANTED NO PART OF THAT [BLEEP] PIE. IN FACT, I'M EVEN MORE SURE  THAT OBAMA WAS LOOKING  FORWARD TO WATCHING  PRESIDENT ROMNEY HAVING TO CHOKE IT DOWN FOR HIM.
Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME  OBAMA WAS PLANNING TO LOSE  TO ROMNEY.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT  PLANNING TO LOSE BUT HE WAS  SURE AS HELL TRYING TO, TWO WORDS, JON, FIRST DEBATE. TWO MORE, IN DENVER. THEY PROVIDE SOME CONTEST TO  THE FIRST TWO WORDS.
Jon: YOU ARE SAYING OBAMA  TOOK A DIVE.
OF COURSE HE TOOK A DIVE,  OF COURSE HE DID.
Jon: IN DENVER HE TOOK A  DIVE YOU'RE SAYING HE TOOK A  DIVE.
EXACTLY WE SAID IT FOUR  TIMES TOGETHER. THE POINT IS OBAMA IS A  SMART MAN, JON. AND A NOTORIOUSLY BRILLIANT  SPEAKER. YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY THINK  THAT SPENDING A COUPLE OF  HOURS SLEEPLY LOOKING AT HIS HANDS WAS THE BEST CODO. YOU KNOW THAT PIECE OF PAPER  HE KEPT LOOKING DOWN AT  DURING THE DEBATE, ALL IT  SAID WAS JUST KEEP BLOWING THIS, KEEP BLOWING IT.
Jon: BUT WHY, WHY WOULD  HE DO THAT? WHEN --
FISCAL CLIFF, JON, ON  DECEMBER 31st IF CONGRESS  CAN'T COMPROMISE ON A BUDGET SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE  SINGLE-HANDEDLY PROVEN THEY  ARE INCAPABLE OF DOING, WE HEAD OVER THE FISCAL CLIFF  AND THE ENTIRE ECONOMY  EXPLODES. YOU THINK OBAMA AND BIDEN  WANT TO BE OUR ECONOMY THEY  WILL MA AND LOUISE? YOU GET IT, THEY WILL MA AND  LOUISE, JON, REMEMBER THEY  HOLD EACH OTHER'S HANDS AND DRIVE OVER A CLIFF.
Jon: OH, [BLEEP] SAKE,  SPOILER ALERT.
SPOILER, 1991.
Jon: DON'T SAY A WORD  ABOUT STEEL MAGAZINE  KNOLLIAS.
SHELBY DIES.
Jon: WHAT!
ROMNEY WAS TOO SMART. HE KNEW THAT NO PRESIDENT  HAD EVER BEEN RE-ELECTED  WITH THIS TERRIBLE AN  ECONOMY. SO IF ROMNEY WAS GOING LOSE  HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO GO  IN BIG, THUS WE ALL ENJOYED THE MOST DECEITFUL AND  UNLIKEABLE CAMPAIGN IN  MODERN TIMES.
Jon: ROMNEY DID PULL THAT  OFF. HE DID DO THAT.
HE DID. THERE IS KIND OF MAKING  SENSE TO ME NOW. IT MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE RZ  ROMNEY WAS TRYING TO BLOW  IT.
OBAMA LIKE ANY NEW  PRESIDENT HAS TO DEAL WITH  THE UPPER DECK THEIR HIS PREDECESSOR LEFT IN THE ROOT  VELT BATHROOM ON HIS WAY OUT  EXCEPT THIS TIME HIS  PREDECESSOR IS HIMSELF.
Jon: HE IS BLOOEP   WLOOEPNESS-- [BLEEP].
IT IS MUCH WORSE THAN  THAT, HE IS [BLEEP].
Jon: JOHN OLVER,  EVERYBODY. [BLEEP]
