Jon: WHAT'S UP?
WHOO! YEAH! DON'T STOP CHEERING.
Jon: FIRST  LET ME SAY THIS, DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY'RE CHEERING?  YOU ARE THE NUMBER ONE FILM IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY, THE GREATEST COUNTRY THAT GOD HAS EVER GIVEN A MAN, YOU ARE NUMBER ONE.
THANK YOU, MAN, THANK YOU. THAT WAS AWKWARD.
Jon: THAT WAS REALLY AWKWARD. THIS, THIS FILM. FIRST OF ALL YOUR PERFORMANCE IS TREMENDOUS. AFTER HAVING SEEN IT -- HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU BLINK IN THIS MOVIE? BECAUSE IT LOOKED TO ME, YOU ARE YOU ON SCREEN, I WOULD SAY A GOOD 97-98 MINUTES.
117 MINUTES.
Jon: IT LOOKED -- ARE YOU REALLY IN IT 117 MINUTES.
I BLINKED FOUR TIMES.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
AND WE SHOT THE MOVIE OVER A MONTH AND A HALF AND I DIDN'T BLINK THE ENTIRE TIME EXCEPT THOSE FOUR TIMES TOO.
YOUR CHARACTER -- THE EMBODIMENT OF THIS CHARACTER IS SO COMPLETE, IT REALLY, LIKE YOU ACTUALLY HAD CONTROL OVER BODY THINGS THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLABLE. AUTONOMIC RESPONSES. THAT'S THE KIND OF ACTING THAT YOU WERE DOING.
YES.
Jon: DOES DE NIRO BLINK? DE NIRO BLINKS BUT NOT GYLLENHAAL.
I'LL TELL YOU, THERE WERE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE NOT HELPING MY -- I WAS EATING A LOT OF KALE. SO I WASN'T BLINKING BUT THERE WERE OTHER THINGS THAT I COULDN'T CONTROL.
Jon: WHY WERE YOU -- OH, DOES KALE? REALLY? SO YOUR FILM IN THIS, IT'S ALL NIGHT SCENES.
YEAH.
SO YOUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK COMPLETELY FLIPPED AROUND.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU'RE NOT EATING.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT BLINKING.
YEAH. YOU'RE INHABITING THIS CHARACTER, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW, IT IS A GUY, THEY CALL THEM STRINGERS, THEY'RE OUT THERE SHOOTING THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES FOR LOCAL NEWS PROGRAMS.
YEAH. YEAH. THEY'RE THE GUYS THAT GO WHEN THE UNION GUYS ARE ASLEEP, YOU KNOW,THEY GO AND TRY AND COLLECT FOOTAGE, YOU KNOW, TO SELL FOR LOCAL NEWS. AND THE GORRIER THE FOOTAGE, THE MORE THEY GET PAID FOR IT.
Jon: AND HE REALLY, YOU KNOW, HE'S THE TYPE OF GUY THAT YOU FEEL LIKE WOULD CREEP YOU OUT NO MATTER WHAT HE DID.
WELL, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE MOVIE IS REALLY A SUCCESS STORY.
Jon: YES.
YOU KNOW? AND IT REALLY IS AN ALLEGORY FOR SORT OF YOU CAN PUT IT IN ANY JOB, YOU KNOW, ANY OCCUPATION. I THINK HE'D BE EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE DID, YOU KNOW?
BUT CREEPY.
ALWAYS, ALWAYS CREEPY.
Jon: ALWAYS CREEPY.
YES.
Jon: BUT SO TO DO THAT OVER --
GASEOUS AND CREEPY. BY THE WAY I'M GETTING VERY NERVOUS. SO GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE, NOT BECAUSE OF THE GAS. BUT FRIENDS OF MINE.
I'M NOT EATING KALE ANYMORE
Jon: STEVE CARRELL.
YEAH.
Jon: ARE EMBODYING THE PSYCHOPATHIC CHARACTERS WITH SUCH EASE AND SUCH TOTAL COMMITMENT, THAT I REALLY QUESTION LIKE THE NICE TIMES WE'VE SHARED.
YOURSELF? YOURSELF?
Jon: NO! ARE YOU SAYING I'M A PSYCHO PATH. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I WANT TO BE KNOWN AS THE HOST OF THE DAILY SHOW. AND YOU MUST DO --
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO, YOU CHALLENGE YOURSELF. YOU ENJOY THE PHYSICAL CHALLENGES OF ROLES. THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING FROM YOU.
WELL, WHAT -- WHAT I TRY AND DO IS I TRY AND I FIND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT INSPIRE ME TO CREATE A CHARACTER.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THE MAIN INFLUENCE FOR ME CREATING THIS CHARACTER, WHICH IS SPECIFIC AND HAS SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES WAS YOU. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN GETTING, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF POSITIVE RESPONSE FROM THE MOVIE. IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL, YOU KNOW, THIS PAST WEEKEND.
YEAH.
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, JON.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WELL, THE FILM IS TERRIFIC. YOU WERE VERY GOOD IN IT, YOU'RE REALLY WITHOUT YOU I DON'T THINK THIS IS A FILM.  I FEEL LIKE YOU CARRIED THE WRITER, THE DIRECTOR, WHO'S THE SAME GUY. AND IN SOME RESPECTS, I DON'T WANT SAY VALIDATED THEM.
WELL, THANK YOU. I WANT TO SAY --
Jon: I WAS JUST TRYING TO PUT NEW AN INCREDIBLY AWKWARD POSITION. THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO DO.
AWKWARD POSITION. OKAY, BUT I WANT, I WANT --
Jon: THE WRITING AND DIRECTING IS PHENOMENAL. IT'S GREAT.
IT IS, IT IS I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE MOVIE. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING ME CREATE THIS CHARACTER.
Jon: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WENT BACK TO THAT JOKE. "NIGHTCRAWLER." IT'S IN THE THEATRES NOW. DON'T BLINK.
