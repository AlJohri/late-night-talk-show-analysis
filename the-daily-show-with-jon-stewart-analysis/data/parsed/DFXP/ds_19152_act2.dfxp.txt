Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW 13 YEARS AGO, WAS IT 13 YEARS AGO, 13 YEARS AGO WHEN AL QAEDA WAS OUR TOP TERRORIST ENEMY WE KNEW AL QAEDA WANTED TO ATTACK AMERICA. THEY HAD ALREADY BOMBED THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN 1993. AND TWO, WE GOT A MEMO THAT SAID THAT THEY WANTED TO DO THAT. KIND OF A GIVEAWAY. IS ISIS THE SAME KIND OF THREAT TO AMERICA?
WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY, OF COURSE, THAT INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS DON'T BELIEVE ISIS RIGHT NOW POSES A THREAT TO THE U.S. HOMELAND.
Jon: OR TO PUT THAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.
THIS IS NOT SOMALIA THIS IS NOT YEMEN, THIS IS A TURNING POINT IN THE WAR ON TERROR. OUR STRATEGY WILL FAIL YET AGAIN. THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO RISE TO THE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL GET KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HERE'S MY IMPRESSION OF EVERYONE WHO CRAWLED OUT OF BED HUNGOVER SUNDAY MORNING AND TURNED ON THE TV TO SEE LINDSEY GRAHAM.
BEFORE WE ALL GET KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: REALLY? (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: ALL OF US? (LAUGHTER) OF COURSE-- OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE-- WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE-- WE HAVE TO TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE OF LINDSEY GRAHAM'S REPUTATION FOR EVEN-KEELED UNDERSTATEMENT, LIKE WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT NOT LETTING PEOPLE HAVE ASSAULT WEAPONS.
IF MY FAMILY WAS IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF GANGS THAT WERE ROAMING AROUND NEIGHBORHOODS IN NEW ORLEANS OR ANY OTHER LOCATION, THE DETERRENT EFFECT OF AN AR-15 TO PROTECT MY FAMILY I THINK IS GREATER THAN A DOUBLE BARREL SHOTGUN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ON BALANCING THE BUDGET.
ALL THIS TALK ABOUT FEAR, IT'S REAL. WE'RE ON AN UNSUSTAINABLE PATH WHEN IT COMES TO OUR NATION.
Jon: ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
WE'RE WALKING DOWN THE ROAD TO ARMAGEDDON.
Jon: THE POOR MAN LIVES HIS ENTIRE LIFE TRAPPED IN THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. FOR GOD'S SAKES, I HAVE SEEN CHIHUAHUAS IN HANDBAGS WHO ARE LESS FRETFUL AND SHAKING. (LAUGHTER) BUT EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS SUSTAINED THIS LEVEL OF PANIC FOR 13 YEARS. EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE BOOGEYMEN THAT LIVE UNDER HIS BED, AREN'T REALLY THERE AT ALL.
THERE WILL BE NO PEACE IN OUR TIME AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE POLITICS OF APPEASEMENT AND LET A GUY LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN GET AWAY WITH BUILDING MOBILE BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS SYSTEMS, LARGER MISSILES, PROCURRING MATERIALS THAT COULD ONLY BE USED IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. FOR US TO SIT BACK WOULD BE A NATIONAL TRAVESTY.
ACT NOW OR WE WILL PAY LATER.
Jon: DID I SAY OR, I MEANT AND. (LAUGHTER) FOR MORE ON SENATOR GRAHAM'S ISIS COMMENTS WE GO TO OUR SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE LIVE AT SENATOR GRAHAM'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SAM...
YES.
Jon: WHAT, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM SENATOR GRAHAM?
WELL, JON, THE SENATOR'S STAFF TELL ME IT'S WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE COMMENT WAS TAKEN COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT. GRAHAM IS ON THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE. HE HAS A FULL, NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISIS THREAT...
HELP ME, HELP ME! I'M BEING ATTACKED BY A TERRIBLE MONSTER. OH HELP...
Jon: SAM, WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT?
OH THAT, THAT, OH, THAT IS JUST A HIGH LEVEL POLICY DISCUSSION SENATOR GRAHAM IS HAVING WITH --
WHO'S THERE? WHO'S THERE? STAY AWAY, STAY BACK, I'M ARMED AND DANGEROUS. I'M DANGEROUS.
K, YEAH. SOUNDS LIKE HE'S WRAPPING UP.
Jon: SAM, I KNOW ISIS ARE BAD BUT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE AN AIR FORCE OR A SUSTAINABLE IDEOLOGY. IF WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEM CAUSING DAMAGE HERE AT HOME, IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CAUSE DAMAGE BUT I BELIEVE FEWER THAN ALL OF US WILL DIE, THAT'S WHAT I --
OF COURSE. YES, OF COURSE. I KNOW HE KNOWS THAT. HE'S JUST URGING CAUTION AND VIGILANCE AS HE DID LAST MONTH WHEN HE PROPOSED THE MANDATORY NIGHT LIGHT ACT OF 2014.
Jon: THAT'S, THAT'S...
MONSTER, MONSTER! YOU FOUL, FOUL BEAST.
Jon: WHAT'S THAT. WHAT IS...
OH NO.
Jon: WHAT'S GOING ON?
OKAY, WELL THAT SOUNDED LIKE EITHER A SENSIBLE DISCUSSION OF TROOP LEVELS OR SENATOR GRAHAM JUST FLUNG A CRYSTAL DECANTER THROUGH A FULL LENGTH MIRROR.
Jon: BECAUSE?
HE CAUGHT A REFLECTION OF HIMSELF AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS SADDAM HUSSEIN.
Jon: ALRIGHT, LOOK. THIS IS...
STAY BACK YOU! DON'T COME... OH WAIT, MERCY ME, I THOUGHT WAS FIVE ISIS MILITANTS COMING TO GET ME. TURNS OUT IT WAS MY OWN LITTLE HAND REACHING FOR MY COFFEE MUG. LORDY, MY HEART'S THUMPING FASTER THAN A JACK RABBIT IN A HUCKLEBERRY PIE.
OH JON, HE'S WORKING ON IT, OKAY. BABY STEPS.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND, THANK YOU, SAM. SAMANTHA BEE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
