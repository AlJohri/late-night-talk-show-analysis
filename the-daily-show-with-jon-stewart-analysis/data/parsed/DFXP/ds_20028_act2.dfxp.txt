Jon:  WELCOME BACK. AS WE'VE HEARD, THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE GETS ANOTHER CHANCE ONCE CONGRESS COMES BACK IN JANUARY. BUT THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE FACES ONE MORE VERY IMPORTANT HURDLE.
IN THE CASE OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE ITS BUILDER TRANSCANADA IS USING THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN TO TAKE HUNDREDS OF MILES OF PRIVATE LAND FROM PRIVATE OWNERS.
Jon: EMINENT DOMAIN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FORCES PRIVATE LAND OWNERS TO SELL THEIR PROPERTY BECAUSE IT'S NEEDED FOR PUBLIC USE. NOT TO BE CONFUSED EMINEM DOMAIN, EMPOWERING EMINEM TO TAKE YOUR PROPERTY HE DISSES YOU IN A RAP BATTLE. PALMS WEAK. MOM'S SPAGHETTI. ALL RIGHT. THE POINT IS, I DON'T KNOW THE LYRICS. THE POINT IS, THE COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUILD A PIPELINE THROUGH THE UNITED STATES NEEDS MORE THAN JUST CONGRESSIONAL  APPROVAL. IT ALSO NEEDS SIGN-OFFS FROM THE INDIVIDUALS WHO OWN THE LAND THAT THE PIPELINE WOULD CUT ACROSS. I MEAN, TRANSCANADA CAN'T JUST LAY PIPE ANYWHERE IT WANTS TO WITHOUT PERMISSION. IT'S NOT BILL COSBY. IT CAN'T JUST GO ... AND BESIDES IT'S GOING TO BE A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. AND EVERYONE KNOWS HOW REPUBLICANS FEEL ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN. LIKE BACK IN 2005 AFTER THAT LANDMARK SUPREME COURT CASE KELO VERSUS NEW LONDON. YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT. WHICH RULED THE GOVERNMENT COULD TAKE PRIVATE LAND AND GIVE IT TO A CORPORATION IF DOING SO MIGHT HELP THE ECONOMY.
THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN SHOULD NOT BE USED SIMPLY TO FURTHER PRIVATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
THERE'S HARDLY A CLEARER PRINCIPLE IN ALL THE CONSTITUTION THAN THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY. SO MUCH FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE THAT YOUR PROPERTY CAN ONLY BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE, NOT PRIVATE USE.
Jon:  SEE, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. CLEARLY THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS NOT PRIVATE USE. IT'S PUBLIC USE. ANYBODY IN AMERICA COULD DRIVE THEIR TAR SAND OIL UP TO CANADA AND SHIP IT BACK DOWN THAT PIPELINE. WHETHER IT BE TRANSCANADA THE PRIVATE CORPORATION THAT BUILT IT OR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WITH AN EXCESS OF TAR SAND OIL. [LAUGHTER] AND YOU KNOW HOW REPUBLICANS FELT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO SET ASIDE LAND FOR ALLEGED PUBLIC GOOD OF CONSERVING LAND.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THREE MILLION ACRES, AND DEEM IT UNTOUCHABLE FOR FURTHER ENERGY FOR THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO STEP ALL OVER PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THIS NATION.
Jon: GOD KNOWS THIS COUNTRY WAS NOT BUILT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF TAKING LAND AWAY FROM ITS RIGHTFUL AND ORIGINAL -- [LAUGHTER] WELL THAT'S DIFFERENT TOO THOUGH. YOU DON'T WANT TO USE EMINENT DOMAIN TO CONSERVE LAND, AND IT'S CLEAR KEYSTONE PIPELINE WON'T BE DOING THAT. I WONDER HOW PROPONENTS OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE WHO HATE EMINENT DOMAIN WOULD SQUARE THOSE CIRCLES?
I AM DISTURBED ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BECAUSE I THINK PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS.
Jon:  GO ON.
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT SAID WRONGLY I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT COULD DO IT TO HELP OUT PRIVATE INTERESTS. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE HELPING OUT PRIVATE INTERESTS.
Jon:  OF COURSE NOT. IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE AND THE SANCTITY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF, THE PROBLEM WITH THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE THEN IS EMINENT DOMAIN.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE ISN'T THE ISSUE OF EMINENT DOMAIN. THE PROBLEM IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN SHUT THAT PROJECT DOWN.
Jon:  WHAT THE [BLEEP] [LAUGHTER] HOW DID YOU GET ... YES, THE PROBLEM ISN'T THE PROJECT I WANT UNDERMINING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE I SUPPOSEDLY SUPPORT. IT'S THE PRESIDENT USING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VETO. THE PROBLEM IS THE CONSTITUTION. [LAUGHTER] WELL, IT'S ALL GOING TO BE A MOOT POINT BECAUSE NINE MONTHS AGO THE REPUBLICAN-LED HOUSE PASSED THE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION ACT TO PROHIBIT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM EXERCISING ITS POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO GUESS WHAT? DONE AND DONE. THAT LAW PASSES, THERE'S NO WAY TRANSCANADA CAN USE EMINENT DOMAIN TO BUILD THEIR PIPELINE.
I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT MEASURES TO LIMIT EMINENT DOMAIN BUT I STRONGLY OPPOSE AN EXEMPTION FOR TRANSCANADA, KEYSTONE XL AND ANY OTHER ENTITY THAT CANNOT PROVIDE PROOF THEIR PROJECT ARE FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT.
Jon:  OH RIGHT. UNLESS THE PRIVATE PROPERTY PROTECTION FREEDOM FIGHTERS HAPPEN TO INCLUDE A SMALL DISCLAIMER IN THEIR EMINENT DOMAIN IS EVIL LAW THAT STATES THAT IT, QUOTE, SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY PROJECT FOR WHICH CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN INITIATED PRIOR TO THE DATE OF ENACTMENT. IN OTHER WORDS, ANY PROJECTS ALREADY IN THE MOTHER [BLEEP] PIPELINE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
