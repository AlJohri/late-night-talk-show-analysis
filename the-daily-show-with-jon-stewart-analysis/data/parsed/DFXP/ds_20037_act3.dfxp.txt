Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, A DIRECTOR HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED "BIG EYES."
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR TECHNIQUE. HOW LONG DID THAT PIECE TAKE TO EXECUTE?
THAT? PROBABLY MONTHS. YOU KNOW, FIRST THE THINKING, THE SKETCHING, THEN THE TIME WITH JUST ME AND THE OILS --
OILS? BUT ISN'T THAT ACRYLIC?
AH, THAT. YEAH, IT'S LIKE A JUMBLE OF IDEAS AND RATTLING AROUND IN MY BRAIN.
SO, WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR IDEAS?
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME TIM BURTON! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) â™ª TIM BURTON  WELCOME!
NICE TO SEE YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: VERY PLEASED. VERY PLEASED TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM.
FELLOW DIRECTOR.
THANK YOU. FELLOW DIRECTORS. LET'S JUST TALK SHOP. I LOVE IT. YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THESE PICTURES, BUT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD JUST HOW BANANAS THE STORY IS.
OH YEAH. I MEAN, I GREW UP WITH THESE IMAGES.
Jon: YES.
AND I WAS, EVEN AS A CHILD I WAS FASCINATED OF WHY GROWN PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A PICTURE OF A CRYING CHILD IN THEIR LIVING ROOM --
Jon: WITH GIANT EYES!
YEAH! YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY LIKE, TO ME, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A HORROR MOVIE IMAGE, THESE WEIRD EYES LOOKING.  AND EVERYBODY HAD IT.
Jon: THAT TYPE OF THING APPEALS TO YOU SOMEWHAT. (LAUGHTER)
SORT OF INFLUENCED ME A BIT. BUT IT WAS SUCH A FASCINATING PHENOMENON IN THE SENSE THAT SOME PEOPLE LOVED THEM AND SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS THE DOWNFALL OF CIVILIZATION, YOU KNOW. AND, YOU KNOW,  I, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, THOUGHT IT WAS WALTER KEANE WHO WAS THE ARTIST.
Jon: YES.
AND LATER LEARNED THE REAL STORY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HE WAS TAKING CREDIT FOR HIS WIFE'S WORK. SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE ALL RELATIONSHIPS I'VE HAD WITH MYSELF, AMAZING DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS CREATING THESE STRANGE MUTANT CHILDREN, JUST SEEMED INTERESTING TO ME. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WELL BROKEN DOWN! AND THAT'S WHAT -- YOU KNOW, THIS IS -- WHAT'S SO INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT THIS STORY IS IT INCAPSULATES ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE '50s AND '60s CULTURE, SORT OF THAT, YOU KNOW, THE BEAT GENERATION STRIKING OUT IN BOHEMIAN WAYS BUT ALSO WOMEN FINALLY TAKING CONTROL OF THEIR OWN WORK. HE WAS AN ARTIST AS WELL, YES? WALTER?
WELL, NO. THAT'S THE THING. YOU KNOW, THEY WENT TO TRIAL AND, AND THE TRIAL --
Jon: THAT'S MY FAVORITE, BY THE WAY. THE TRIAL --
WELL, AND PEOPLE THINK IT WAS OVER THE TOP, BUT WE ACTUALLY TONED IT DOWN. I MEAN, HE DID CROSS-EXAMINE HIMSELF. HE DID, YOU KNOW, RUN FROM --
Jon: REALLY!
YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT ON, YOU KNOW, A BAD SITCOM, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAD TO, THIS IS THE REALISTIC VERSION OF IT IS WHEN YOU SEE IT, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S WAS WHAT WAS SO AMAZING ABOUT THE STORY, HE WAS SUCH, YOU KNOW, A MIXTURE OF THINGS, WALTER. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS AT THE SORT OF FOREFRONT OF, YOU KNOW, PRINTING OF ART.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, FOR THE MASSES. AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE PICASSOS AND MATISSES HANGING ON THEIR WALL. THEY HAD KEANES.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO IT WAS A WEIRD CULTURAL PHENOMENON AS I WAS GROWING UP.
Jon: AND THEY SAY, YOU KNOW, HE WAS NOT WITHOUT TALENT, BUT HIS TALENT IS AS A P.T. BARNUM, AS A BARKER.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: AND THEY SAY THESE OTHER POP ARTISTS, WARHOL AND THOSE, WOULD SAY, WE BORROWED FROM WALTER.
YEAH NO, AND I MEAN, AND ALL THE STUFF, NOW YOU WALK INTO A MUSEUM, YOU GO BUY A POSTER. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ON A POSITIVE LEVEL, IT DID CONNECT, YOU KNOW, SORT OF THE ART WORLD TO PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO AFFORD IT, AND YOU KNOW, AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW, HE WAS, YOU KNOW, SCHMOOZING CELEBRITIES, YOU KNOW, KIM NOVAK, JIM CRAWFORD, YOU KNOW. SO, YOU KNOW, ALL THE PRACTICES THAT, YOU KNOW, HE COULD EASILY MOVE AT A MOVIE STUDIO AND BE VERY SUCCESSFUL.
Jon: YOU WHAT WOULD BE CRAZY? IMAGINE A GUY LIKE TRYING TO DO THAT, LIKE PAINT THESE PICTURES BUT HE HAD LIKE SCISSORS FOR HANDS. LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M JUST PITCHING THIS OUT! I'M PITCHING THIS OUT, TIM! LISTEN TO ME!
YEAH, WELL THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THAT MOVIE. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THIS MOVIE, SO THEY REALLY WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE THAT MOVIE.
Jon: PUTTING THEM TOGETHER. NOW, MARGARET,  SO MARGARET KEANE WHO IS THE WOMAN WHO IS ACTUALLY THE ARTIST INVOLVED IN THIS, STILL ALIVE.
YEAH, YEAH. AND SHE PAINTS EVERY DAY. AND I MEAN, SHE IS THE MOST QUIET, PRIVATE, SHY, SHE'S THE MOST SORT OF QUIET FEMINIST YOU'VE EVER MET IN THE SENSE THAT SHE REALLY HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'T REALLY A VICTIM BECAUSE SHE WAS COMPLICIT IN THIS SORT OF THING.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THEN WHEN SHE WENT TO TRIAL, YOU KNOW, SHE WASN'T DOING IT TO BE VINDICTIVE. SHE JUST WANTED THE TRUTH TO COME OUT. AND YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST LIKE THE QUIETEST, SORT OF -- YOU KNOW, THE MOST QUIET FEMINIST YOU'VE EVER MET IN A WAY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING VERY AMAZING ABOUT HER AND STRONG.
Jon: HOW HARD WAS IT TO GAIN HER TRUST IN TERMS OF PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT? BECAUSE IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION, YOU HAVE THIS VERY PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS A STORY THAT, YOU KNOW, IS, IT'S GOT ITS HIGHS AND LOWS AND SHE CAN AT TIMES BE NERVOUS ABOUT PUTTING IT BACK OUT THERE. DID YOU HAVE TO CONVINCING HER?
WELL YEAH, I MEAN, BETWEEN THE WRITERS AND MYSELF, YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT I THINK SHE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD. AND WHEN SHE MET AMY ADAMS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SHE REALIZED THAT AMY WANTED TO DO HER JUSTICE AND TELL IT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE -- YOU KNOW, THE AMAZING THING, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE WEREN'T THERE WHEN SHE SAW THE FILM. YOU KNOW, SHE STARTED CRYING BECAUSE SHE GOT TO SPEND AN EXTRA TWO HOURS WITH WALTER AGAIN, WHICH SORT OF FREAKED HER OUT.
Jon: AND SHE WAS -- BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY SPLIT UP AFTER HE DEFAMED HER AND TRIED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR ALL HER WORK.
AND BEAT HER AND WHATEVER ELSE.
Jon: RIGHT. AND ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS.
YEAH.
Jon: BUT SHE ACTUALLY, SHE WAS STILL, I MEAN, SHE WAS A BIT CHARMED BY HIM STILL.
YEAH, WELL, I MEAN, HE WAS, YOU KNOW, THAT STRANGE MIXTURE OF P.T. BARNUM AND AN AMAZING SORT OF MARKETEER AND AGAIN, AHEAD OF HIS TIME ON THAT LEVEL.
Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
HE WAS JUST ALSO A PSYCHO.
Jon: WITH AN AWESOME, JOB, MAN.  BUT IT DOES, THERE WAS EVERYTHING, AS I WAS WATCHING I WAS THINKING LIKE, OH I CAN SEE WHY TIM BURTON LIKES THIS MOVIE. I CAN SEE WHY, YOU KNOW, IT JUST APPEALS.
WELL, THOSE IMAGES, YOU KNOW. THEY JUST UNFORTUNATELY, OR FORTUNATELY, STAY WITH YOU FOREVER.
Jon: YES.
THOSE, YOU KNOW, I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH THOSE EYES STARING AT YOU. THAT'S WHY I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT. I HAVE INSOMNIA.
Jon: WELL, I REALLY HOPE THAT THAT NEVER CHANGES BECAUSE I LOVE THE WORK THAT COMES OUT OF IT. "BIG EYES," IS GOING TO BE IN THE THEATERS. IT'S CHRISTMAS DAY. TIM BURTON, EVERYBODY.
