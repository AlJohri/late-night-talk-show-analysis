OCTOBER 20th, 2011, FROM COME DOE CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW  YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART.   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT. OH, WE GOT A ONE GOOD ONE TONIGHT. ALSO RICHARD BROOKHISER IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HE HAS WRITTEN A NEW BIOGRAPHY OF JAMES MADISON WHO AS YOU KNOW IS THE NAME  SAKE OF THE SECOND BIGGEST CITY IN WISCONSIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT TO THE BIG NEWS.
MOAMMAR QADDAFI IS DEAD CONDITIONS.
QADDAFIES WITH COMPANY TURED IN SIRTE. HES WITH ON THE HOOD OF A CAR. THEY HAD TO PROP HIM UP. HE SEEMED VERY GROGGY. ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE REBELS INVOLVED IN THAT SITUATION.
HE PLEADED DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, BUT THEY SHOT HIM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW WHY THEY SHOT HIM AFTER HE SAID DON'T SHOOT, THEY'RE REBELS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: MAY,-- HEY, MAN, DON'T TELL US WHAT TO DO. OF COURSE WITH THIS SORT OF EVENT THERE'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION OF PROOF.
THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FROM THE NEWS AGENCY AFP. I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT THAT, IT'S QUITE GRAPHIC. (LAUGHTER) HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN THOSE SHOES TO MY CHILDREN. THEY SHOT HIM AND THEN THEY APPARENTLY DROPPED THE HOSS ON HIM. ALL RIGHT. SO WHERE DID THEY FINALLY CATCH QADDAFI, IT'S BEEN MONTHS, A SAFE HOUSE, A BOMB BUNKER.
REPORTS THAT MAYBE HE WAS IN A HOLE SORT OF LIKE SADDAM HOOUK HEW HUSSEIN, HE  WAS THROWN IN THE SPIDER HOLE.
Jon: REALLY? A HOLE? SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER ONE OF MY PERIODIC SEGMENTS WHERE I GIVE ADVICE  TO DICTATORS. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AS LONG AS IT'S JUST IS THE A TIP. ANYWAY, HEY, DICTATORS, WHAT'S UP? OH, IS THAT NEW WALLPAPER IN THE RAPE ROOM? ANYHOW, HEY, LISTEN, AT SOME POINT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE KEPT UNDER YOUR THUMB  FOR HOWEVER MANY YEARS ARE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND TROY TO HUNT YOU DOWN. AND AT THAT POINT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF WITH THE URGE TO HIDE IN A HOLE. BUT UNLESS YOU'RE THE ROAD RUNNER AND CAN DO THIS-- I WOULD RESIST HIDEY HOLING. BECAUSE AT SOME POINT THE ENEMY GUYS WITH THE GUNS, THEY CHECK IN THE HOLES. YOU'RE WELCOME. NOW WHEN ANY FIGURE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WORDS TO LIVE BY. THEY ALWAYS GO IN THE HIDEY HOLE AND PEOPLE ALWAYS FIND THEM AND KILL THEM. BE HONEST. WHEN ANY FIGURE OF SOME NOTE DIES THERE ARE ALWAYS ALONG WITH THAT PERSON'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS, INEXPLICABLE EXCENTRICITIES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT COMPLI KEAT AND FILL OUT THEIR LIFE STORIES. BUT WITH DICTATORS, THESE EXTROMS TEND TO BE SOMEWHAT CAMP AMP FOR IDENTIFICATION.
HIS LINK WITH NOTORIOUS ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICANS.
QADDAFI GIVES OUT WATCHES WITH HIS FACE ON THEM AS GIFTS.
SEE?
THE FIRST PART OF THAT SENTENCE, PUTS HIM IN LEAGUE WITH BIN LADEN. THE SECOND PART WITH MICKEY MOUSE.
A DICTATOR THAT HAS REPRESSED HIS OWN PEOPLE.
A HYPOCOND GROW AK WHO RECUSES TO CLIMB MORE THAN 5 STEPS AT ONCE --
I COULD CONSIDER.SELF A PRETTY GOOD HYPO CON GROW AGO, WHAT DISEASE IS  TRIGGERED ON THE 6th STEP? AND WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I'M COMING DOWN WITH IT? BUT THE THING ABOUT CAD AVI IS THAT HIS [BLEEP] WORDNESS STOOD OUT EVEN AMONGST  THE -- [BLEEP] WEIRD.
REPORTS FROM TRIPOLI SAY REBELS HAVE FOUND A PHOTO ALBUM INSIDE MOAMMAR QADDAFI'S  COMPOUND FILLED WITH IMAGES OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE.
HE WAS THE STRANGEST HEAD OF STATE I'VE EVER MET. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I HAVE PICTURES OF CONDOLEEZZA RICE. I AM A NAUGHTY DICTATOR. OH, I'M NAUGHTY, ONLY'S SO NAUGHTY! I WAS PLAYING FRUIT NINJA AND I GOT A CRAZY HIGH SCORE. SOMEBODY SHOW THIS HIGH SCORE TO HILL ROE CLINTON, WITHOUT YOU DO THAT FOR ME, THANKS.
WOW.
Jon:  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FRUIT [BLEEP] NINJA! ACTUALLY, THAT WAS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE HILL ROE CLINTON SEEING MY FRAUGHT NINJA SCORE. THAT WAS HER REACTION TO THE NEWS QADDAFI HAD BEEN CAPTURED. OF COURSE IN LEBBIA THE NEWS WAS MET WITH NO LESS AS TON ESCHMENT BUT UNDERSTANDABLY  LESS RESTRAINT. THE CELEBRATORY SHOOTING OF THE GUN, THE CHANTING OF THE VICTORY SLOGANS, AND OF  COURSE IS THAT GENTLEMAN THROWING A BABY IN THE AIR? (LAUGHTER) THE DICTATOR IS DEAD! FINALLY THE LAW AGAINST THROWING BABIES HAS BEEN REPEALED! WHOOE. I NEVER THOUGHT I WITHOUT SAY THIS, TAKE THAT BABY FROM THAT MAN AND GIVE HIM AN AK-47. OF COURSE, THE ADMINISTRATION REACTED TO TODAY'S VICTORY WITH RELIEF AND AMAZEMENT. THE LIBYAN PEOPLE WITH GRAT TOUD AND JOBLATION. BUT FOR ONE GROUP, THE DEATH OF QADDAFI THE DICTATOR AND MAJOR SPONSOR OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM  WITHOUT REQUIRE MORE REFLECTION, TEAM TO PROCESS AND FIGURE OUT HOW THIS GOOD  NEWS COULD ACTUALLY BE BAD?
TOO SOON TO TELL AS FAR AS WHAT THIS MEANS FOR LIBYA. I THINK, AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE REBELS ARE GOING TO DO IN LIBYA AFTER THEY TAKE OVER. THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE A READY CALL ISLAM CYST REGIME OR ONE THAT HARBORS  INTERNATIONAL TER RESTS, WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TAKEN A STEP BACKYARD-- BACKWARDS.
Jon: ARE WE SURE ABOUT GETTING RID OF QADDAFI. THE NEXT GUY THAT COMES IN COULD BE CRAZY. AND SPONSOR TERRORISM. I MEAN-- SO FOX NEWS AND JOHN BOLTON, VERY CONCERN CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T  KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO BE THERE TO REPLACE MOAMMAR QADDAFI AND THERE'S ONE  OTHER THING THAT BOTHERS BOLTON.
IF WE HAD ACTED SWIFTLY AND DECISIVELY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS THING WE  MIGHT HAVE SHATTERED QADDAFI'S GOVERNMENT NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE CONFLICT.
Jon: IF ONLY WE HAD CREATED THIS TERRIBLE UNCERTAIN POWER VACUUM, TERRORISM MAGNET MORE QUICKLY. IS THERE NO ONE, IS THERE NO REPUBLICAN THAT CAN BE GRACIOUS AND STATESMAN LIKE IN THIS SITUATION? WE REMOVED A DICTATOR IN SIX MONTHS. LOSING NO AMERICAN SOLDIERS. SPENDING LIKE A BILLION DOLLARS, RATHER THAN A TRILLION DOLLARS AN ENGENDERING WHAT APPEARINGS  TO BE GOODWILL TO PEOPLE WHO NOW HAVE A PRIDEFUL STORY OF THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE TO  TELL, NOT TO MENTION OIL, THEY HAVE OIL. ANYBODY WANT TO GIVE CREDIT?
LET'S GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DOW. IT IS THE FRENCH AND BRITISH THAT LEAD ON THIS FIGHT.
NOT SO OF THE UNITED STATES BUT FRANCE AND ENGLAND.
I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BRITISH AND FRENCH IN THIS.
Jon: WHAT BLOOEPT BLOOEP IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE! HONESTLY, WHAT? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IS IT THAT-- ARE YOU THAT SMALL, ARE YOU THAT-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT  ELSE, WE REALLY HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE CHINESE. I MEAN WITHOUT THE INVENTION OF GUN POWDER, I DON'T KNOW--  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU KNOW, IT JUST, HOW BAD WAS IT? KEEP YOUR EYES ON STEVE DOOCY WHEN GRETCHEN THROWS TO COMMERCIAL ON FOX AND FRIENDS.
THIS ADMINISTRATION SAID WE'RE GOING TO LEAD FROM BEHIND. WE TALKED ABOUT IS THAT A GOOD STRATEGY BEFORE? I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT. I MEAN WE LET THE EUROPE --
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE IT WORKED.
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE IT WORKED. WE'RE FOX AND FRIENDS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.
Jon: UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN HERE, STEVE DOOCY ACTUALLY TRIED TO CONSOLE THAT WOMAN  AS THEY LEFT, HEY, KID, LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, OBAMA'S POLICIES CAN'T BE VINDICATED  EVERY DAY. BY THE WAY, I'M NO EXPERT ON BODY LANGUAGE BUT I'M NOT SURE SHE APPRECIATED THIS. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: GAAH, GET ME TO THE SILKWOOD SHOWER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
