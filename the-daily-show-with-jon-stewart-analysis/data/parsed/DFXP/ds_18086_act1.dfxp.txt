Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW"! I'M JON STEWART. GOT A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT. MR. TOM CRUISE WILL BE JOINING  US ON THE PROGRAM. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. ONCE AGAIN HAVING TO START UNDER  JUST HORRIFIC EVENTS HERE IN  THIS COUNTRY. I REALLY HATE THE FACT THAT I  CAN CROSS REFERENCE MY THOUGHT  TO SO MANY OTHER EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE YEARS OF  A SIMILAR ILK SO I'M NOT GOING  TO. I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS TO  BOSTON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ONCE AGAIN IN THE  FACE OF GROSS INHUMANITY  INSPIRING AND SOLIDIFYING MY BELIEF IN HUMANITY AND THE  PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY. SO THANK YOU. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE. (APPLAUSE)  AN AMAZING -- THAT'S QUITE A  LITTLE CITY YOU'VE GOT GOING ON  UP THERE. AND YOU KNOW NEW YORKERS AND  BOSTON OBVIOUSLY HAVE KIND OF A  LITTLE BIT OF A COMPETITION, OFTEN TIMES THE TWO CITIES  ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF VARIOUS  LEVELS OF SUCKITUDE. (LAUGHTER)  BUT IT IS IN SITUATIONS LIKE  THIS THAT WE REALIZE THAT IT IS  CLEARLY A SIBLING RIVALRY AND THAT WE ARE YOUR BROTHERS AND  SISTERS IN THIS TYPE OF EVENT. AS A CITY THAT KNOWS THE FEELING  OF CONFUSION, ANGER AND GRIEF  AND CHAOS THAT COMES WITH THESE EVENTS, I CAN TELL YOU FROM  PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: YOU'VE GOT  A HELL OF A CITY GOING THERE AND YOU'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN  THE FACE OF ALL THIS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YUP. PRETTY GOOD. WHY DON'T WE DEAL WITH SOME  NON-AWFUL NEWS? IT APPEARS WE MAY BE ON THE CUSP  OF A BREAK THROUGH ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM.
THE BIPARTISAN SENATE GANG OF  EIGHT IS SOON EXPECTED TO  RELEASE AN IMMIGRATION BLUEPRINT THAT WILL INCLUDE A PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP.
Jon: REALLY? "GANG?"  REALLY? FIRST OF ALL. THAT'S A GANG OF EIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  THAT LITTLE GROUP THERE. YOU'RE GOING TO CALL THEM A  GANG? I THINK YOU MEAN THE CO-OP BOARD  OF EIGHT. (LAUGHTER)  THAT IS NOT A GANG. HOW IS THAT A GANG? "I GET A TEARDROP TATTOO FOR  EACH APARTMENT APPLICATION I  REJECT."  (LAUGHTER)  "THIS TATTOO RIGHT HERE, THE WOMAN HAD A DOG."  (LAUGHTER)  BUT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IS  GOOD NEWS SEEING AS THIS IS THE CURRENT PATH. (AUDIENCE REACTS)  SO ANY PATH IS BETTER THAN THIS. ON SUNDAY GANG OF EIGHT MEMBER  CAPTAIN THIRSTY, A.K.A. NO-SPIT  JOHNSON, A.K.A. THE HUMAN DESSICANT, A.K.A. THE GEL PACKET  THEY PUT IN CLOTHES SO THEY  DON'T RETAIN MOISTURE, RUBIO LAID OUT THE PATH.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A  FINE, AN APPLICATION FEE, YOU  HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK.
Jon: (LAUGHS)  BACKGROUND CHECK THAT'S EASY TO  GET AROUND, BACKGROUND CHECK. ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TELL  IMMIGRATION YOU'RE A GUN. (LAUGHTER)  STILL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO  BAD. YOU GET A FEW FEES, A FEW FORMS  THEN YOU'RE A CITIZEN, RIGHT?
ASSUMING ALL THAT HAPPENS THE  ONLY THING YOU GET IS A WORK  PERMIT.
Jon: OH. WELL, THAT'S KIND OF A LOT OF  WORK JUST TO BE ALLOWED TO DO  OUR (BLEEP)EST WORK. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN YOU GET  TO PARTAKE IN THE AMERICAN  DREAM.
YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR ANY  FEDERAL BENEFITS AND YOU HAVE TO  PROVE THAT YOU CAN SUSTAIN AND SUPPORT YOURSELF AND YOU HAVE TO  BE IN THE SYSTEM AT LEAST TEN  YEARS BEFORE WE GIVE YOU ACCESS TO APPLY FOR THE LEGAL  IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: OKAY, NOW THAT'S  STARTING TO SOUND LIKE A LOT. ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE SAME SYSTEM  THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GET "BOOK  OF MORMON" TICKETS. (APPLAUSE)  GOOD SHOW. AND I'M FRIENDS WITH THOSE GUYS! ALL RIGHT, SO THIS NEW PATH TO  CITIZENSHIP IT'S ABOUT STAMINA. IT'S LONG, IT'S ARDUOUS, BUT  IT'S POSSIBLE. THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING OUT  OF THESE INDIVIDUALS' CONTROL  THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY CAN WALK DOWN THIS POSSIBLE  PATH TO CITIZENSHIP?
YOU DON'T GAIN ACCESS TO ANY  OF THAT UNTIL THERE'S A  UNIVERSALLY VERIFIED SYSTEM IN  PLACE.
THAT WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO  CHECK THE CITIZENSHIP STATUS OF  WORKERS THEY WANT TO HIRE.
Jon: THAT WILL NEVER  HAPPEN. (LAUGHTER)  WE STILL COME UP WITH A COMPUTER  PROGRAM LIKE THAT FOR VETERANS  MEDICAL RECORDS AND WE LIKE  VETERANS! (LAUGHTER)  WHAT ELSE HAS TO HAPPEN?
ANOTHER IS A TRACKING SYSTEM  TO MAKE SURE THAT IMMIGRANTS WHO  COME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY DON'T END UP OVERSTAYING THEIR  VISAS.
Jon: NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP  UNTIL "LOGAN'S RUN" IS A  REALITY. (LAUGHTER)  WOW, I AM OLD. REALLY? NO "LOGAN'S RUN" FANS? REMEMBER "YOU'RE GOING TO  CAROUSEL" AND THEN THE PEOPLE  AND FARRAH FAWCETT WOULD --  (LAUGHTER). OR NOT! I'M JUST GONNA GET SOME MILK. (LAUGHTER)  THEN THERE WAS THE FRANCHISE  CALLED "STAR WARS". (LAUGHTER)  AND LASTLY --
AND LASTLY THERE WOULD BE  WHAT HE CALLED REAL BORDER  SECURITY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE  FENCING.
Jon: FENCING? FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU REALLY THINK  THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO KEEP  IMMIGRANTS OUT? (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)  I MEAN, COME ON! OH, WITH THE BARBED WIRE. SO CONGRATULATIONS CONGRESS, IT  SURE AS HELL AIN'T AMNESTY BUT  BY CREATING THIS PATH TO CITIZENSHIP YOU CREATED A  BARRIER IMMIGRANTS WON'T BE ABLE  TO GET PAST. (LAUGHTER)  FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIOR  IMMIGRATION CORRESPONDENT AL  MADRIGAL. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  AL, THANK FOR JOINING US. AL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS, IS --  THIS IMMIGRATION BILL, IS IT  REALLY GOING TO HELP ITS INTENDED BENEFICIARIES?
JON, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE  DIFFICULT. BUT I DO ALSO THINK THAT  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM  COULD HELP TAKE THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND PUT THEM BACK  ON A PATH TO PRESIDENTSHIP. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I'M SORRY, SAY THAT  AGAIN?
LOOK, JON, CLEARLY  REPUBLICANS THINK THEY HAVE TO  REACH OUT TO LATINOS TO REGAIN A CHANCE TO OCCUPY THE CASA  BLANCA, THAT'S WHY LATINOS ARE  SETTING TOUGH BUT FAIR CONDITIONS FOR REPUBLICANS TO  MEET. PASSING IMMIGRATION REFORM IS  JUST THE BEGINNING.
Jon: WHAT COMES NEXT FOR  THEM?
FOR STARTERS THEY'RE GOING TO  HAVE TO GO AT LEAST TEN YEARS  WITHOUT SAYING SOMETHING LIKE  THIS.
MY FATHER HAD A RANCH, WE  USED TO HIRE 50 TO 60 WETBACKS  AND PICK TOMATOES. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
NOW, UNLESS DON YOUNG IS  REFERRING TO THE MANY CHILDREN  OF ALISTAIR AND CATHERINE VON  WETBACK. (LAUGHTER)  OF THE NEW ENGLAND VON WETBACKS,  THAT AIN'T COOL. AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING  NATIONAL POLITICIANS. I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT MAYORS  WHO BRUSH OFF LATINO RACIAL  PROFILING CASES WITH COMMENTS LIKE THIS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR THE  LATINO COMMUNITY TODAY?
I MIGHT HAVE TACOS WHEN I GO  HOME. I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
MIGHT HAVE TACOS? MIGHT? IF YOU CAN THINK OF A BETTER WAY  OF DELIVERING BEEF, LETTUCE,  CHEESE, CO-MAY OES AND BEANS IN A CRISPY OR SOFT SHELL DEPENDING  ON YOUR PREFERENCE YOU'RE  WELCOME TO TRY, TACO MAYOR! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: WHAT ABOUT A BURRITO?
IT'S DELICIOUS TOO! (LAUGHTER).
Jon: IS THAT IT? IS THAT THE CONDITIONS TO PUT  REPUBLICANS BACK ON A PATH TO  PRESIDENTSHIP?
NO, IT'S NOT IT! REPUBLICANS MUST ALSO STOP USING  "HISPANIC" TO REFER TO ALL  LATINOS. YOU'LL NOW JUST HAVE TO  DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN MEXICANS,  HONDURANS, GUATEMALANS, DOMINICANS, KARDASHIANS. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: I DON'T THINK  KARDASHIANS ARE LATINO.
WHAT? KARDASHIANS AREN'T LATINO?
Jon: NO, I DON'T BELIEVE  SO.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THEIR  BUTTS? (LAUGHTER).
Jon: JOHN.
GO AHEAD, JON, EXPLAIN THE  KARDASHIANS' BUTT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: NO. (LAUGHTER)  LOOK, IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  DOES ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE  LISTED, ARE LATINOS THEN WILLING TO CONSIDER PUTTING REPUBLICANS  BACK ON THE PATH TO  PRESIDENTSHIP? AMNESTY OR NOT?
YES. WITH ONE FINAL REQUIREMENT.
Jon: YES?
THEY MUST GUESS WHAT NUMBER  I'M THINKING OF. (LAUGHTER)  BETWEEN, I DON'T KNOW, LET'S SAY  ONE AND A MILLION.
Jon: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE, BUT,  LIKE THE PATH TO CITIZENSHIP  THAT THEY'RE OFFERING, IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE WHILE.
Jon: THANK YOU, AL. AL MADRIGAL,
