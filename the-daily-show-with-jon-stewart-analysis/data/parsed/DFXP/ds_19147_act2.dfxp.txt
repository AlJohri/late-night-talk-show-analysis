[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED RECENTLY THAT THE WORLD IS GOING TO, OH, WHAT'S IT CALLED, [BLEEPED]. [BLEEPED]. AS WE'LL SEE IN TONIGHT'S SEGMENT "CRISIS IN THE EVERYWHERE." YOU GOT YOUR ISIS OVER THERE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA, KIDNAPPING, TERRORIZING. ISRAEL AND HAMAS MAY HAVE STOPPED FIGHTING, BUT ISRAEL JUST ANNEXED 1,000 ACRES OF PALESTINIAN FARMLAND TO TRY TO PUT UP A NEW HOLY [BLEEPED] ARE THOSE RADISHES?  THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST RADISHES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I SEE WHY ISRAEL WANTS THAT LAND. THOSE VEGETABLES ARE LITERALLY THE SIZE OF THE BALLS NETANYAHU MUST HAVE TO THINK HE CAN JUST GO AND TAKE PEOPLE'S RADISHES. AND THOSE ARE ONLY THE OVERT LAND GRABS. THERE'S SOME SNEAKIER LAND GRABS GOING ON, AS WELL.
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN REPORTEDLY TOLD A EUROPEAN OFFICIAL HE COULD "TAKE KIEV IN TWO WEEKS IF HE WANTED TO."
THE KREMLIN, THOUGH, SAYS THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT.
Jon: OUT OF CONTEXT. WHAT CONTEXT COULD THAT SENTENCE SOUND GOOD IN? [LAUGHTER] PUTIN SAID HE COULD TAKE KIEV IN TWO WEEKS, TO THE PROM. THE CONTEXT IS THIS: RUSSIAN-BACKED REBELS ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER UKRAINE. LOTS OF CASUALTIES. SO GET IN THERE AND START FIGURING OUT HOW TO STOP THE FIGHTING.
UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT SAYS HE AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT, BUT RUSSIA SAYS THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS NOT EVEN A PARTY TO THE CONFLICT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: DON'T PISS ON MY NIPPLES AND TELL ME IT'S RAINING, VLAD. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MADE SENSE. OH, YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE CONFLICT, RUSSIA? LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS IN FRONT OF ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT ROLL 212.
NATO SAYS SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW RUSSIAN TROOPS FIGHTING IN UKRAINE.
3,000 OR 4,000 RUSSIAN TROOPS FIGHT WITH THE REBELS.
THE UKRAINIANS ACTUALLY CAPTURED 10 RUSSIAN PARATROOPERS, EVEN MORE EVIDENCE INCLUDING FIELD ARTILLERY, TRUCKS AND TROOP CARRIERS.
Jon: OH. PUTIN'S FACE IS GOING TO BE REDDER THAN THOSE FREAKY FRIDAY RADISHES. LOOK AT THOSE RADISHES. SERIOUSLY. THERE IS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT WITH THOSE RADISHES. THEY'RE LIKE THE X-MEN OF ROOT VEGETABLES. PUTIN, YOU'RE DEAD TO RIGHTS, BUDDY. LET'S HEAR THE APOLOGY.
THE KREMLIN SAYS THEY MUST HAVE GOTTEN LOST AND WANDERED OVER THE BORDER.
THE REBEL COMMANDER SAID RUSSIAN TROOPS WERE IN UKRAINE TO TAKE A VACATION.
RUSSIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS THE IMAGES COULD BE A FARCE, CLAIMING THEY COULD BE FROM COMPUTER GAMES.
OH, YEAH, THAT IMAGE, THAT'S FROM A COMPUTER GAME, AND THAT GAME IS GRAND THEFT UKRAINIAN LAND AS SEEN BY THIS ACCURATE SATELLITE IMAGERY. THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, THE WHOLE WORLD IS FALLING APART. YOU KNOW IT'S TIME FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA TO PUT HIS SIZE 12s ON THE GROUND. WHERE IS HE HEADED?
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN ESTONIA THIS MORNING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: EXCELLENT CHOICE. AS WE ALL KNOW, ESTONIA IS A COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS CULTURE RICH IN ESTONIANS. IT'S ONE OF THE BALTIC STATES ALONG WITH LITHUANIA, LATVIA AND I BELIEVE ACTIVIA. I BELIEVE. [APPLAUSE] BUT ALL RIGHT. HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HE CAN LAY DOWN THE LAW FROM WHEREVER HE WANTS. THE WORLD IS FALLING APART. LET HIM HAVE IT, BARACK OBAMA.
IF, IN FACT, RUSSIA IS PREPARED TO STOP FINANCING THE ARMY TRAINING... [LAUGHTER]
Jon: CAN YOU PICK UP THE PACE, BUDDY. THE WORLD'S BLOWING UP. MAYBE MOVE THINGS ALONG A LITTLE BIT. I KNOW WHAT THIS IS. HE'S SLOW TALKING. YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN OUT THE REST OF YOUR TERM. YOU PICK UP THE PACE, MR. PRESIDENT. OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PUT A SHOT CLOCK ON YOU.
OUR PREFERENCE IS A STRONG, PRODUCTIVE, COOPERATIVE RUSSIA. BUT THE WAY THE ACHIEVE THAT IS BY -- [BUZZER SOUNDS] OH, WE'RE OUT OF TIME. WE'RE OUT OF TIME! I'M SORRY. WE'RE IMPATIENT. IT'S JUST THAT IN THE TIME IT TAKES TO GIVE A SPEECH TO THE BALTIC STATES, PUTIN ANNEXED THEM. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
