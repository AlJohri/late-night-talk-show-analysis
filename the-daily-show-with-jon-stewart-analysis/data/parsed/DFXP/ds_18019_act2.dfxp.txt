Jon: WELCOME BACK. OVER THE PAST TWO SHOWS WE'VE  BEEN LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENS  WHEN MODERN POLITICAL TACTICS ARE FORCED ON A MIDDLE SCHOOL  ELECTION. WHY? IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE [BLEEP]. TONIGHT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR  SERIES, THE STRATEGISTS.
PREVIOUSLY ON THE  STRATEGISTS, JASON AND JOHN  BROUGHT MODERN POLITICAL TACTICS TO AN 8th GRADE STUDENT  COUNCIL ELECTION AND WERE  IMMEDIATELY EMBRACED BY THE  CHILDREN.
SO YOU LIKE THIS CAMPAIGN? NOT REALLY. KIND OF MEAN.
Reporter: NOW WITH THE  CAMPAIGN ENTERING ITS FINAL  DAYS, THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WAS APPROACHING. AND AS 25-YEAR CAMPAIGN  STRATEGIST MARCO KNOWS, YOU HAVE  TO BE PREPARED
THE DEBATE IS THE MOST FORMAL  SETTING FOR A CANDIDATE'S IMAGE  TO BE FULLY REALIZE. SO YOU PRACTICE EVERYTHING. WE EVEN FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL  WORDS. WE FIND OUT WHAT WORDS WE LIKE  AND WE FIND WAYS TO REPEAT THEM  IN MEANINGFUL, CATCHY PHRASES SO THAT THEY'LL STICK WITH THEM  WHEN THEY GO INTO THE POLLS
ULNA... HONOR. LEADERSHIP. NACHOS. YEAH, WHAT WORD ARE WE GOING TO  USE?
NACHOS  HOW OFTEN? ALL THE TIME  SO DESCRIBE THE SCHOOL USING  A NACHO METAPHOR
NACHOS, THE SCHOOL IS LIKE  NACHO CHEESE. MORE NOURISHING AND YOU CAN'T  GET ENOUGH OF IT.
Reporter: AS THE PEARLMAN  CAMPAIGN SEIZED THE MOMENTUM  JASON DESPERATELY SEARCHED FOR A CELEBRITY TO GIVE ZABLO CAMPAIGN  A BOOST
I NEED A BIG-TIME ACTOR, ANY  SUPER HERO WOULD BE GREAT. OH, REALLY? WOULD HE DO IT
Reporter: BUT TIME WAS  RUNNING OUT BECAUSE WITH DEBATE  AFTERNOON FINALLY HERE FOR THE CANDIDATES, IT WAS GAME TIME. ♪
IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE  THAT I INTRODUCE KYLE PEARLMAN  AND LAUREN ZABLO.
MY NAME IS LAUREN ZABLO AND I  AM RUNNING TO BE YOUR STUDENT  COUNCIL PRESIDENT. I'VE BEEN IN STUDENT COUNCIL  SINCE SIXTH GRADE SO I WILL MAKE  EVERY EFFORT SNTS
Reporter: WHILE LAUREN WENT  WITH SUBSTANCE, THE PEARLMAN  TOOK A DIFFERENT APPROACH
HELLO, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. I CAN SEE I'M THE ONLY ONE  WEARING PLAYED TODAY
I'M SORRY TO SEE THAT I'M THE  ONLY ONE WEARING A FLAG PIN  TODAY. THIS ELECTION WE ALL KNOW IS  PRETTY MUCH A POPULARITY CONTEST
USE NACHOS  FOR EXAMPLE, YOU COULD SAY  NACHOS ARE POPULAR. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SAY GO BLED AMERICA  GOD BLESS AMERICA  NACHOS  . Reporter: IT WAS BACK TO THE  WALL. IT WAS TIME FOR JASON TO DEPLOY  HIS CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT.
WHO HERE IS A FAN OF BATMAN? WHO ABOUT IRONMAN? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   HOW ABOUT THE PHANTOM? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BILLY DAY.
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT  ELECTION OF YOUR LIFETIME. THAT IS WHY I AM THROWING MY  FULL SUPPORT BEHIND LAUREN ZABLO  FOR WOOD CLIFF MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASS PRESIDENT.   ( APPLAUSE )
Reporter: BUT AN OCTOBER  SURPRISE CAN QUICKLY TURN INTO  AN OCTOBER NIGHTMARE.
SO, KYLE. YOU WANT ME TO SAY WHAT TO  LAUREN? I CAN'T SAY THAT. SHE'S ONLY 13 YEARS OLD. (NERVOUS LAUGHTER) WHAT DO YOU  MEAN OVER YOUR HEAD? EVERYTHING IS OVER YOUR [BLEEP] HEAD. YOU'RE 4'2. I'LL KICK HIS [BLEEP]. REALLY?
Reporter: WITH THE DEBATE  OVER, IT WAS TIME FOR THE  CHILDREN TO VOTE. AND FOR THE STRATEGISTS TO GET  INSTANT FEEDBACK FROM EXIT  POLLS. 12 DAYS OF CAMPAIGNING,  THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS  UNNECESSARILY SPENT, ALL LED UP  TO THIS ONE MOMENT.
GOOD AFTERNOON, WOOD CLIFF  STUDENTS AND FACULTY. I AM PROUD TO MAKE THE  ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE WINNING  STUDENT COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE FOR YOUR 2012 WOOD CLIFF MIDDLE  SCHOOL PRESIDENT. KYLE.
[BLEEP]. YEAH, I FIGURED. HEY, BILLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK  ABOUT A THIRD GRADE RACE IN  AKRON, OHIO? ♪
Reporter: WITH THAT, JOHN,  JASON AND BILLY WERE GONE  BECAUSE AT ANY STRATEGIST KNOWS WINNING IS EVERYTHING. CLEANING UP THE MESS IS SOMEONE  ELSE'S PROBLEM. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: PEARLMAN, ZABLO. NICELY DONE, GUYS. VERY NICELY DONE. FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO  THANK YOU GUYS FOR  PARTICIPATING. YOU WERE GREAT SPORTS. IT WAS REALLY A WONDERFUL  EXERCISE. I WANT TO ASK WHAT YOU FELT LIKE  IT WAS LIKE TO WORK WITH JASON  AND JOHN.
TELL THEM IT WAS GREAT. HE WAS GREAT. Jon: WHAT PLANS DO YOU HAVE  NOW THAT YOU'RE IN OFFICE.
I'LL JUMP IN AND TAKE THIS. FOR A START, JON, IT'S PRESIDENT  PEARLMAN TO YOU. RESPECT THE [BLEEP] OFFICE AND  PRESIDENT PEARLMAN IS NOT TAKING  QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS REAL  QUICK AFTER THAT DISPLAY. YOU MIGHT WANT TO SIGN THOSE  GUYS. THESE ARE JUST RELEASES THAT  INDEMNIFY THE SHOW OF PHYSICAL  OR EMOTIONAL DAMAGE INFLICTED ON YOU OR THE SCHOOL. IT'S A PLEDGE TO NEVER TELL YOUR  PARENTS THAT THIS HAPPENED. THANKS SO VERY MUCH.
