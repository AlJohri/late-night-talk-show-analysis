( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ). HEY, WELCOME BACK. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. VERY BIG NEWS OUT OF PHOENIX  ARIZONA, JODY ARIAS HAS BEEN  FOUND GUILTY OF THE BOYFRIEND KILLING THING. FOR THEIR SEEMINGLY NONSTOP  COVERAGE OF THE TRIAL, CNN WAS  FOUND GUILTY OF NEWS SLAUGHTER. LOOK IT UP. IT'S A THING. IN THE CULMINATION OF A  LONG-RUNNING SAGA THAT INVOLVES  ALMOST EVERY CNN CORRESPONDENT AS WELL AS A HOMEMADE CRIME  SCENE AND GRUESOME RE-ENACTMENT  AND THE MURDERING OF AN INNOCENT CARPET, THAT STAIN IS NEVER  COMING OUT. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. BECAUSE CNN PUT ALL THEIR NEWS  EGGS IN THE ARIAS BASKET THEY  WERE FORCED TO COVER OTHER STORIES INCLUDING ANOTHER GOOD  CRIME DRAMA FROM THEIR CURRENT  LOCATION. ASHLEY BANFIELD FROM A PARKING  LOT IN PHOENIX REPORTING VIA  SATELLITE WITH NANCY GRACE WHO SEEMED TO BE IN THE SAME PARKING  LOT IN PHOENIX. I'M BASING THAT, OF COURSE, ON  THE FACT THAT THE CARS THAT ARE  PASSING BY BOTH LOCATIONS ALSO APPEAR TO BE PASSING DIRECTLY  INTO NANCY GRACE'S BOX. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN SHOT AT THE  SAME TIME. THEREFORE, UPS OWE FACT OWE  THOSE TWO PEOPLE HAD TO BE IN  THE PRETTY MUCH SAME SPOT. OR WE JUST SAW ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF  PHOENIX'SY LOSE I HAVE BEEN  SEVEN-MILE LONG BUS-NESS  MONSTER. THE LOCALS CALL HIM OLD BUSTY. BUT ACCORDING TO THE ATLANTIC  WIRE, BOTH WERE ACTUALLY A MERE  SIX PARKING SPACES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. MEANING THE MONSTER ISN'T REAL. WHO DOES THAT? THE AUDACITY OF SOMETHING EVEN  RESEMBLING A NEWS ORGANIZATION  TO PRETEND THAT A CORRESPONDENT IS IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT  LOCATION WHEN IN FACT THAT  CORRESPONDENT IS STANDING NO MORE THAN A FEW FEET AWAY. MAYBE IN THE VERY SAME STUDIO  FOR ALL WE KNOW. PRETTY SHAMEFUL. COULDN'T THE TWO OF THEM HAVE  JUST SHARED? LIKE ASHLEY HAS A RESTRAINING  ORDER AGAINST NANCY GRACE. WHICH NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,  IT DOESN'T SEEM ALL THAT CRAZY. BUT TO THE NEWSMEN'S CREDIT THEY  DID THEIR BEST TO CREATE THE  ILLUSION OF NOT STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHERNESS.
WHETHER IT WAS A VOLUNTARY  CAPTIVITY BY MINE R MIND CONTROL  OR WHETHER IT WAS PHYSICAL, YOU KNOW, PHYSICAL, YOU KNOW, CHAINS  OR LOCKS. IN THAT RESPECT, ARE YOU  SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE NOT  TELLING US.
AM I HEARING YOU CORRECTLY? Jon: ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T HEAR  YOU THERE'S THIS LADY JABBERING  JABBERING... IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME TO HEAR YOU. SHE'S JUST BA-BA-BA-BA. HERE'S AN IDEA IF YOU HAVE  TROUBLE HEARING, TAKE YOUR  FINGER OUT OF YOUR [BLEEP] EAR BECAUSE SHE'S RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN JUST DO THIS. WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? IS ANYBODY AT CNN ALLOWED  INDOORS ANYMORE? FIRST YOU HAVE THE BROOK BALDWIN  IN THE STREETS OF BOSTON FOR  SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE BOMBING. THEN YOU MAKE HER FLY OVER  CLEVELAND TO COVER THE  KIDNAPPING STORY. NOW BANFIELD AND GRACE ARE IN A  PARK LOCALITY IN PHOENIX. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE THE AMAZING  RACE OF NEWS. CNN JUST RUNS FROM TOWN TO TOWN  DOING CRAZY [BLEEP] THINGS FOR A  GIANT NOVELTY PAYCHECK. I'LL GIVE THIS TO CNN. THEY DID PROVIDE ACTUAL  INFORMATION ON WHAT ARE ACTUAL  CRIME STORIES. THEY CONTINUE THEIR COVERAGE  THROUGHOUT THE DAY I PRESUME  WITHOUT ANY FURTHER  DISTRACTIONS. THERE'S MORE FOOTAGE. OH, NO, THERE'S A CAT ON A  RUMBA. OH, NO, AND THEN THERE'S. OH, A MOTORCYCLE. OH, MY GOD! NO, THAT CAN'T BE. IT'S THAT [BLEEP] ENCRUSTED  CARNIVAL CRUISESHIP. CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THING IS  STILL ON THE LOOSE. WE'LL BE RIGHT
