Jon: WELCOME BACK. WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH  THE CRACKS, LEWIS BLACK COVERS  IT FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL "BLACK IN BLACK -- BACK IN BLACK."
THE GUN DEBATE HAS BEEN  RAGING FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S HARD TO SAY WHEN IT STARTED  BUT I'M GOING TO GO WITH RIGHT  AROUND THE INVENTION OF THE  GODS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND EVERYBODY HAS AN OPINION  INCLUDING AMERICA'S FOREMOST  EXPERTS ON THE SUBJECT, OUR  CELEBRITIES. AND THEY ARE CHIMING IN FROM  BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT.
I'M A GOOD NEIGHBOR, I HAVE A  NICE CLEAN BORDERLINE BUT IF YOU  CROSS IT I'LL KILL YOU.
NOTE TO SELF, CROSS OLD MAN  NUGENT'S PLACE OFF MY GIRL SCOUT  COOKIE DELIVERY LIST. WHY ARE WE ASKING RANDOM  CELEBRITIES ABOUT THIS ISSUE  ANYWAY WHEN WE SHOULD BE ASKING MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE, OUR  ACTION HEROS.
SYLVESTER STALLONE NOW  SUPPORTS A NEW FEDERAL ASSAULT  WEAPONS BAN SAYING QUOTE "LIKE REALLY UNLESS YOU ARE CARRYING  OUT AN ASSAULT, YOU CAN'T HUNT  WITH IT WHO IS GOING TO ATTACK YOUR HOUSE AN EXPLETIVE ARMY.
A WHAT ARMY? A (bleep) ARMY, AN ASS-WIPE  ARMY? IS IT A PENIS ARMY? [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE IF A PENIS ARMY IS  ATTACKING MY HOUSE, I WANT TO  KNOW. TRUST ME, I KNOW ALL THEIR WEAK  SPOTS. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BUT KUDOS TO STALLONE FOR  SPEAKING OUT AGAINST GUNS, AND  BY THE WAY DON'T MISS HIS NEW MOVIE "BULLET TO THE HEAD" IN  THEATERS NOW. IT'S LIKE RHINESTONE BUT WITH  BULLETS TO THE HEAD. BUT SYLVESTER STALLONE ISN'T THE  ONLY ACTOR PROMOTING A NEW MOVIE  WHO HAS VIEWS ON GUN CONTROL.
I THINK THAT YOU CAN'T START  TO PICK APART ANY OF -- ANYTHING  OUT OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS WITHOUT THINKING THAT IT'S ALL  GOING BE BECOME UNDONE. IF YOU TAKE ONE OUT OR CHANGE  ONE LAW THEN WHY WOULDN'T THEY  TAKE ALL YOUR RIGHTS AWAY FROM  YOU.
RIGHT, IN THE SAME WAY IF YOU  TAKE AWAY DIE HARD 2, DIE HARD 3  IS JUST A CONFUSING SERIES OF  EXPLOSIVES. SO THAT'S ONE FOR, ONE AGAINST,  ANY OTHER ACTION STARS WANT TO  STEP UP AND SETTLE THIS?
HI, I'M CHUCK NORRIS A BLACK  BELT PATE ROVMENT IF SOME THUG  BREAKS INTO MY HOME, CAN I USE ANY ROUNDHOUSE KICK BUT I PREFER  TO USE THE BARREL OF MY GUN.
JUST TO BE CLEAR ACCORDING TO  CHUCK NORRIS HE COULD USE THE  ROUNDHOUSE KICK TO PROTECT HIS OWN BUT HE PREFERS TO SHOOT A  MAN IN THE FACE. BY THE WAY, CHUCK, YOU ARE 72  YEARS OLD. AT THIS POINT THE MOST LETHAL  PART OF THE ROUNDHOUSE KICK IS  THE FART THAT COMES OUT WHEN YOU LIFT YOUR LEG. [LAUGHTER] HOW DID CHUCK NORRIS SNEAK INTO  THIS DEBATE ANYWAY? CAN WE GO ANY FURTHER DOWN ON  THE ACTION STAR FOOD CHAIN?
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ARMED GUNS  AT JEWELRY STORES AND ALL KINDS  OF OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS THAT HAVE MONEY. BUT THE GREATEST TREASURE WE  HAVE IS OUR CHILDREN.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY  THIS BUT STEVEN SEAGAL'S OLDER,  FATTER ISRAELI BROTHER IS RIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DOES HE SUGGEST WE SAVE OUR  CHILDREN?
ACTOR STEVEN SEAGAL IS A  TRAINED WEAPONS EXPERT AND LAW  ENFORCEMENT VETERAN OF 20 YEARS. TODAY HE HELPED SHERIFF JOE  ARPAIO AND THE MARICOPA COUNTY  SWAT TEAM TRAIN VOLUNTEER POSSE MEMBERS TO TAKE DOWN AN ACTIVE  GUNMAN IN A SIM LIGHTED  SHOOTING.
STEVEN SEAGAL, SHERIFF JOE  ARPAIO, AN UNTRAINED POSSE, WHAT  COULD GO RIGHT? I SUPPOSE EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED  TO THEIR OPINION BUT IN THE END  THEY ARE DOING WHAT ENTERTAINERS DO BEST, PROVIDING US WITH A  PLEASANT DISTRACTION FROM THE  FACT THAT OUR ACTUAL LAWMAKERS AREN'T DOING (bleep) ABOUT  THIS PROBLEM. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THE MEANTIME, IF SOME THUG  BREAKS INTO MY HOUSE, I'M GOING  TO DEAL WITH IT THE SAME WAY I ALWAYS DO, BY HIDING UNDER MY  COVERS AND PRETENDING I DON'T  SPEAK ENGLISH. JANN?
