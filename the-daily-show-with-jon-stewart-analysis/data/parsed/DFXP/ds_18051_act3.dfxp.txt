(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT EMMY-WINNING  SPORTSCASTER FOR NBC, PLEASE  WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM BOB  COSTAS. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   NICE TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU DOING  Jon: ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A  GUEST ON THAT I CAN SWAP JACKETS  WITH. WE'RE GOING TO TALK SPORTS. THERE'S NOTHING THAT I LIKE  BETTER THAN TALKING SPORTS BUT  BEFORE WE GET TO THE SPORTS I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU  FOUND YOURSELF AT THE CENTER OF  A PLIT CONVERSATION WHEN AT HALF TIME DURING A FOOTBALL GAME  TRAGEDY IN KANSAS CITY.
RIGHT  Jon: WITH THE FOOTBALL PLAYER  WHO KILLED HIMSELF AND THEN HIS  GIRLFRIEND. YOU SPOKE OF A GUN CULTURE
RIGHT  Jon: AND... QUOTED JASON WHITT LOCK A  COLUMNIST FROM KANSAS CITY AND  NOW WRITES FOR THE FOX SPORTS WEBSITE WHO NEVER MENTIONED THE  SECOND AMENDMENT OR GUN CONTROL  BUT TALKED ABOUT A GUN CULTURE WHICH I DO BELIEVE EXISTS. IT'S AN ATTITUDE TOWARD GUNS. OBVIOUSLY I THINK ANY SANE  PERSON BELIEVES THAT WE OUGHT  NOT TO HAVE HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND ASSAULT RIFLES AND  THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE  BACKGROUND CHECKS. YOU SHOULD BE IN A COUNTRY WHERE  40% OF THE GUN PURCHASES ARE  DONE WITHOUT A BACKGROUND CHECK, WHERE IT'S SO EASY TO CIRCUMVENT  THE EXISTING LAWS. WE CAN TIGHTEN ALL THAT STUFF UP  WITHOUT REPEALING THE SECOND  AMENDMENT
Jon: HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT  VERY QUICKLY?
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT SANE  IS, BUT I KNOW A LOT OF WHAT I  HEARD IN THE AFTER MATH IS INSANE
Jon: WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO  BE IN THE EPICENTER OF I GUESS  YOU BECAME THE POLARIZING MAGNET IN THE GUN CONTROL ARGUMENT EVEN  THOUGH THAT WAS NOT THE ARGUMENT  YOU WERE MAKING
FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN NEWTOWN HAPPENED. IT SEEMED THAT THAT CHANGED THE  TONE. ALTHOUGH, AS HORRIBLY TRAGIC AS  THAT WAS, IF IT DID REDIRECT THE  DEBATE AND PEOPLE ARE NOW AT LEAST SOMEWHAT MORE WILLING TO  THINK ABOUT THIS MORE RATIONALLY  AND COMPASSIONATELY, THEN THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT EVEN IF EVERY POSSIBLE  COMMON SENSE BIT OF LEGISLATION  WAS PASSED AND EVEN IF EVERY GUN WERE LEGALLY OBTAINED, YOU'D  STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH A GUN  CULTURE. IT'S AN ATTITUDE TOWARD GUNS. WHEN BELCHER TEXTED HIS FRIEND  WHO SAYS YOU BETTER HAVE A GUN  READY BECAUSE HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS FOOLING AROUND ON HIM. HE TELLS HIS FRIEND DON'T WORRY  I HAVE EIGHT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? WHEN TONY DUNGEE ASKS HIS SQUAD  WHEN HE COACHED THE COLTS IN  TRAINING CAMP WHEN THERE WERE 75, 80 GUYS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE  A GUN AND 75% OF THEM RAISED  THEIR HAND, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE OUT OF EVERY 100  INSTANCE TENTS THAT THESE ARE  BEING USED FOR SPORTING PURPOSES OR LEGITIMATELY FOR SELF-DEFENSE  AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING TRAGIC  EVEN IF IT'S UNINTENTIONALLY TRAGIC HAPPENING? THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT  OR WHAT WHITT LOCK WAS TALKING  ABOUT. A GUN CULTURE.
Jon: THEY WOULD JUMP IN AND  SAY HOW DO WE CHANGE THE CULTURE  THEN? IS IT THAT GUNS LOOK COOL? IS IT THAT... IS IT REAL  SELF-PROTECTION AND REAL SECOND  AMENDMENT RIGHTS OR IS IT THE IDEA THAT I'VE SEEN ENOUGH  MOVIES TO KNOW IF I GO IN SOME  PLACE AND DO THIS, YOU KNOW
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT, YOU KNOW,  RIGHT NOW EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK  THERE'S A COMMERCIAL FOR A MOVIE CALLED BULLET TO THE HEAD. WE'RE STILL IN A CULTURE...
Jon: THAT'S A WORKING TITLE? ONCE YOU'VE THROWN YOUR MAMA  FROM THE TRAIN, WHAT DIFFERENCE  DOES IT MAKE?
BUT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS TO  THIS. MANY ASPECTS TO THIS. WHEN IT COMES TO FOOTBALL, YOU  KNOW, THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,  IT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION TO ASK: CAN YOU EXPECT HUNDREDS IF  NOT THOUSANDS OF FOOTBALL  PLAYERS TO DO SOMETHING WHICH BY ITS VERY NATURE IS BRUTAL,  BELLIGERENT AND VIOLENT, ISN'T  IT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT SOME OF THEM WON'T BE ABLE TO  CONTAIN THAT TO THE FIELD? ISN'T IT REASONABLY TO  INVESTIGATE WHAT HEAD TRAUMA  MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH IT NOT JUST THE EFFECTS OF IT DOWN THE  LINE BUT IN TERM OF MOOD AND  IMPULSE CONTROL AND AGGRESSION? I WAS AWARE OF ALL THOSE THINGS  WHEN I MADE THOSE COMMENTS AND I  TALKED ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS BEFORE AT HALF TIME OF THESE  GAMES AND IN QUESTIONING ROGER  GOODELL AND OTHER NFL OFFICIALS. I JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME THAT  PARTICULAR NIGHT TO HIT EVERY  ASPECT OF A COMPLEX PROBLEM.
Jon: IT WAS HALF TIME. AND I HAD 90 SECONDS. BUT AS I WAS SAYING TO YOU  EARLIER, LOOK, WE'VE CHANGED THE  CULTURE ON A LOT OF THINGS WITHOUT CHANGING THE LAW.
Jon: OR WITHOUT CHANGING  PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, WITHOUT  INFRINGING ON THEIR RIGHTS
EXACTLY. NO ONE REPEALED THE FIRST  AMENDMENT BUT WE CHANGED  PEOPLE'S ATTITUDES TOWARDS  RACIST OR HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS. CIGARETTES REMAIN A LEGAL  PRODUCT BUT ATTITUDES TOWARD  THEM AND UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DANGERS HAVE TAKEN HOLD. SO THE CULTURE HAS BEEN CHANGED. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THERE IS A GUN CULTURE, AND IT  ISN'T GOOD
Jon: TRYING TO MAYBE REDIRECT  THE GUN CULTURE FROM BEING  EITHER A LITMUS TEST FOR TOUGHNESS OR FREEDOM. MAYBE GETTING BACK TO ITS  UTILITY STILL WHILE RESPECTING  THE SECOND AMENDMENT
AND WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE  THAT GUNS ARE GLORIFIED IN HIP  HOP CULTURE, SOME 70% OF THE PLAYERS IN THE NFL ARE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN, NOT ALL OF  THEM ARE INFLUENCED BY THAT PART OF THE CULTURE BUT SOME OF THEM  ARE. GUNS ARE GLORIFIED. MANY OF THESE KIDS COME OUT OF  ENVIRONMENTS WHERE IT'S  COMMONPLACE FOR A 14- OR 15-YEAR-OLD KID TO BE PACKING
Jon: IT'S ALSO VERY  DIFFERENT. CITIES ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE  COUNTRY. THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. IN THE CITY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO  TELL YOU, THOSE GUYS AREN'T  GOING TO TELL YOU ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE A PROBLEM. HANDGUNS ARE A PROBLEM. BUT IT'S ABOUT POLICE  ENFORCEMENT NOT ABOUT PEOPLE'S  RIGHTS. IT'S ABOUT GETTING THEM INTO  LEGAL HANDS AS OPPOSED TO  ILLEGAL.
YEAH. HOW DO THEY OBTAIN THEM AND FOR  WHAT PURPOSE? I DON'T THINK YOU COULD FIND  VERY MANY PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY  IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR SOMEONE IF THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE  WITH IT TO HAVE A GUN IN THEIR  HOME TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY IN THE CASE OF  SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, INVADING  THEIR HOUSE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'VE GOT A  LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY  AND SOME OF THEM ARE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES WHOSE IDEA  IS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE, GOT MY  WALLET, GOT MY WATCH, GOT MY  GLOCK.
Jon: AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT  WITH FORMED JEANS. HE DID IT IN SWEAT PANTS. WHO DOES A GLOCK AND ELASTIC  PANTS? I MEAN IT'S JUST A GRAVITY  ISSUE. WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK. NOW WE'LL GET TO THE SPORTS. WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT  SPORTS. BOB COSTAS. WE'LL BE RIGHT
