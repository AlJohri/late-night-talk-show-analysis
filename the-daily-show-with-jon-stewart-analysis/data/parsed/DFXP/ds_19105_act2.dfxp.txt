WELCOME BACK! WHEN A NEWS STORY FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS,  LEWIS BLACK CATCHES IT. FOR A SEGMENT WE CALL, BACK IN BLACK. EVERYONE WANTS TO LIVE LONGER. I GUESS THE IDEA IS IF YOU GO LONG ENOUGH, IT MUST EVENTUALLY GET GOOD. SO LET'S SEE WHAT GREAT IDEAS OUR BEST SCIENTISTS HAVE COME UP WITH.
SCIENTISTS AT HARVARD AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY MAY HAVE FOUND A WAY TO REVERSE AGING.
THEY'RE CALLING THIS THE VAMPIRE THERAPY.
VAMPIRE THERAPY, I LIKE MY SCIENCE TRENDY. DO I GET TO GET BIT IN THE NECK? DO I FINALLY GET TO DRINK THE BLOOD OF STRANGERS? LEGALLY. IF HARVARD AND SANFORD ARE IN ON IT IT'S GOT TO BE PRETTY SOPHISTICATED.
THEY ACTUALLY SEW TOGETHER AN OLDER MOUSE WITH A YOUNGER MOUSE SO THAT THEY SHARE BLOOD. AND, GUESS WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING?
WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING? I'M GOING TO GUESS EVERYONE STARTED PUKING THEIR GUTS OUT FROM SEWING MICE TOGETHER.
THE OLDER MOUSE, IT GOT STRONGER, IT HAD A BETTER MEMORY AS THEY COULD SEE WHEN IT RAN IT THROUGH MAZES.
ALL THE WHILE SCREAMING, GET THIS [BLEEP] MOUSE OFF MY BACK. OKAY. BESIDES RODENT NEEDLE POINT WHAT ELSE DOES SCIENCE HAVE UP ITS LAB COAT?
SCIENCE AT THE SCRIPTS RESEARCH INSTITUTES IN SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA CREATED AN ORGANISM NOT FOUND IN NATURE.
Jon:  SO WHAT? I DO THAT EVERY MORNING. [LAUGHTER] THEN I FLUSH IT AND GET ON WITH MY DAY.
THE SCIENTISTS SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE CREATED ARTIFICIAL DNA.
THEY DID IT BY ADDING ARTIFICIAL GENETIC BUILDING BLOCKS.
YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM SCHOOL OUR GENETIC CODE CONTAINS FOUR LETTERS, A, T, C AND G THEY'RE THE SO-CALLED BUILDING BLOCKS OF DNA.
A, T, C AND G ARE DEFINITELY MY BUILDING BLOCKS. FOR ME THEY STAND FOR ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, CIGARS AND GRAVY. LET'S PRETEND FOR A MOMENT THAT DNA TAMPERING AND MOUSE TORTURE DOESN'T WORK. THEN WHAT'S LARRY KING GONNA DO?
SCIENTISTS HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME CLONED CELLS FROM ADULTS.
YOU CAN REINJECT SOME OF THE GOOD CELLS IN THE HEART IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER.
WAIT A MINUTE, WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO CLONE PEOPLE AND ALL WE'RE DOING WITH IT IS FIXING USED HEARTS? I DON'T WANT TO REFURBISHED TICKER, I WANT ANOTHER ME. IF YOU CAN GIVE HIM TWO LIVERS I MIGHT NEED AN EXTRA.  SO APPARENTLY, IF WE WANT TO EXTEND OUR LIVES THE CHOICES ARE EITHER BECOME GODS WHO USE TECHNOLOGY TO TOY WITH THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR BEING. IGNORING THESE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD ARISE. OR I GUESS WE COULD JUST EAT SOME KALE AND JOIN A GYM. [LAUGHTER] WELL, I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. GET ME A MOUSE AND SOME THREAD. JON.
Jon: LEWIS BLACK, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
