THEY ARE THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S SEGMENT JON STEW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IF I MAY -- THE PLACEMENT OF THE COMMA IS ACTUALLY -- [LAUGHTER] THUMBS UP...

Jon: KRISTEN SCHAAL, IT SEEMS LIKE DOORS ARE OPENING UP LEFT AND RIGHT FOR WOMEN NOW.
YEAH AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. WE JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HOW HARD OUR SUCCESS WOULD BE ON MEN.
IN THIS SORT OF FEMININIZED ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH WE EXIST TODAY GUYS WHO WERE MASCULINE AND MUSCULAR LIKE THAT IN THEIR PRIVATE CONDUCT AND KIND OF OLD FASHIONED TOUGH GUYS RUN SOME RISKS. YOU ARE IN CONSTANT DANGER OF SLIPPING OUT AND SAYING SOMETHING THAT WILL GET YOU IN TROUBLE AND MAKE YOU LOOK LIKE A SEXIST OR MAKE YOU SEEM THUGGISH OR WHATEVER.
THAT IS SO TRAGIC, POOR INCREDIBLY MANLY, MUSCULAR MAN'S MAN BRITT HUME. IT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION TO FEMININIZE THE ATMOSPHERE BY COMING IN WITH OUR CUT FLOWERS AND SCENTED COMPUTERS AND OUR BREAST MILK FAX MACHINES.
Jon: YOU FAX BREAST MILK?
WHAT, AM I GOING TO FAX FORMULA? I'M NOT A MONSTER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: I GET IT, KRISTEN, BUT MEN AREN'T THAT BAD.
NO, OF COURSE NOT. HEY LET'S DO A ROLE PLAY OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE. I'LL BE EVERY MANLY MAN BOSS I'VE EVER HAD AND YOU BE A LADY SEEKING EMPLOYMENT. OKAY?
Jon: SURE, OKAY. LETS DO THAT. I'LL BE A LADY SEEKING EMPLOYMENT.

Jon: NO, I'M OKAY THAT -- WE'RE AT A JOB -- OKAY I'M JUST GONNA --  [LAUGHTER] WE'RE AT A JOB INT--OK, I'M JUST GONNA
THAT'S DISGUSTING.
I KNOW, SORRY. YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THOSE TEETOTALING  VIETNAMESE POLOCKS ARE YOU.
Jon: THAT'S RACIST AND INCOHERENT, THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE--
OH WELL, LIGHTEN UP, OKAY? SO WHAT ARE YOUR QUALIFICATIONS.
Jon: UH, I HAVE A B.A....
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT YOUR T AND A, EH?
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR TITTIES AND YOUR ASSIES, ALRIGHT.  GET UP, GIVE US A SPIN, JUMP UP AND DOWN. I WANT TO SEE THEM BOUNCE.
Jon: I'M NOT GONNA, I'M NOT GOING TO -- THEY DON'T BOUNCE. I'M NOT GONNA--
ARE YOU GOING TO CRY?
Jon: AM I GONNA CRY-- NO.
OH, YEAH BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO CRY.
Jon: I'M NOT GOING TO CRY KRISTEN.
I'M NOT GOING TO CRY KRISTEN.
Jon: SHUT UP. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? I'M SORRY, JUST-- STOP YOU MADE YOUR POINT. IT WAS TERRIBLE BACK THEN, FINE.
WELL, THAT WAS MY POINT. UNTIL I TRIED IT, JON THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, OKAY. HOLY (bleep) I NEVER KNEW HOW THRILLING IT IS TO HAVE ALL THAT POWER TO ABUSE. I FEEL ALIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME. MY HEART IS POUNDING. I UNDERSTAND HOW UPSET MEN MUST BE TO LOSE ALL THAT.
Jon: I GUESS MEN WILL JUST HAVE TO ADJUST TO A NEW WORLD OF EQUALITY WHERE WE TREAT EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL RESPECT.
(bleep) THAT. THIS ABSOLUTE POWER IS TOO MUCH OF A RUSH. WE'RE COMING FOR IT AND WE'RE GOING TO ABUSE IT MUCH BETTER THAN MEN.
Jon: WELL I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE, I MEAN, MEN, WE LITERALLY MADE WOMEN SLEEP WITH US FOR JOBS.
YOU THINK SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS BAD? WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH YOU YOU'LL BE BEGGING FOR GROPING BECAUSE US LADIES WORK FROM THE INSIDE OUT. I'LL SHOW YOU. LET'S DO ANOTHER ROLE PLAY.
Jon: I REALLY AM NOT COMFORTABLE DOING ANOTHER ONE. I DON'T WANT TO.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO. >>Jon: I REALLY DON'T WANT TO. YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE IT'S FUN AND YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING FUN. THAT'S WHY AFTER THE SHOW WE ALL GO OUT WITHOUT YOU AND TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN YOU USED TO BE.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE, YOU DO THAT?
YEAH, NOBODY HERE LIKES YOU AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT AS A FRIEND BUT I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND AND I WANT MY BEST FRIEND NECKLACE BACK.
Jon: WHAT?  BUT YOU GAVE THIS TO ME AND YOU SAID WE'D BE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER. IT'S MY FAVORITE.
YEAH, I KNOW. THAT'S A SOFT PAIN YOU'LL NEVER SHAKE. AND THAT'S THE POWER OF WOMEN. NOW STAND UP AND DO A SPIN FOR ME.
Jon: HOLY (bleep). THANK YOU. KRISTEN SCHAAL, EVERYBODY. KRISTEN SCHAAL.
