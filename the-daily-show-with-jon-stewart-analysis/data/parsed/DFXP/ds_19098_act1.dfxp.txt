FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING]
Jon: WE WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A NICE SHOW TONIGHT. YOUNG DAVID SPADE WILL BE JOINING US LATER FOR A LOVELY CONVERSATION. BUT, AS YOU KNOW, OUR GOOD FRIENDS OVER AT THE FOX NEWS NETWORK ARE SOMEWHAT OBSESSED WITH A CERTAIN TOPIC. I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. IT STARTS WITH B THREE SYLLABLES.
BENGHAZI.
BENGHAZI.
BENGHAZI.
BENGHAZI.
BENGHAZI.
Jon: NO, BUT I CAN SEE WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN THAT IMPRESSION.  NO, NO. IT'S A DIFFERENT THREE SYLLABLE B-WORD.
BEYONCE.
Jon: YES, BEYONCE. [ LAUGHTER ] AS THE SINGER HERSELF HAS APPARENTLY BEEN MISPRONOUNCING IT ALL THESE YEARS BEYONCE. MAYBE IT'S NOT ALL OF FOX NEWS BUT OUR GOOD FRIEND WILLIAM O'REILLY HAS A SOMEWHAT PARTICULAR BEEF WITH MISS BEY.
AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF THE SINGER BEYONCE FOR PUTTING OUT MUSIC AND VIDEOS THAT ARE LIBERTINE IN TONE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THIS WORLD THAT I LIKE BETTER THAN AN UPSET BILL O'REILLY BECAUSE THE TONE IS SUCH -- IT'S LEVITTOWN CUT WITH A SOUSICANT OF HARVARD SERVED ON A DELICIOUS BED OF NOSTALGIC JUDGMENTALISM. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF OUR BRAND NEW SEGMENT BEY WATCH. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: NOW, A CYNIC, A CYNIC MAY THINK THAT THE SEVEN TIMES OUR FRIEND WILLIAM HAS RECENTLY SHOWCASED BEYONCE'S DISTURBING SEXINESS ON HIS PROGRAM WAS MERELY AN EXCUSE TO RUN PROVOCATIVE B-ROLL TO PERHAPS PROVIDE HIS ELDERLY VIEWERSHIP WITH MUCH NEEDED DISAPPROVAL BONERS. [LAUGHTER] WELL -- LISTEN, IF THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET IT UP IS ANGER, FINE I'LL DO IT. [LAUGHTER] BUT, TO LISTEN TO MR. O THIS IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE CLOSE TO HIS HEART.
IT SENDS A LIBERTINE MESSAGE TO CHILDREN. EXPLOITIVE GARBAGE THAT YOU KNOWS HARMS IMPRESSIONABLE CHILDREN. SHE'S TALENTED. SHE HAS A GOOD VOICE AND -- SHE COULD BE ON BROADWAY.
Jon: YEAH, WHY CAN'T BEYONCE BE MORE LIKE THAT NICE PATTI LUPONE WITH THE SINGING AND THE DANCING AND ONE OF GALS WHO PLAYED THE WITCHES IN WICKED. A JELLICLE CAT. AND DON'T TELL ME CATS IS CLOSED. NOW AND FOREVER THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE. CATS, CATS WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN. AS LONG AS THERE IS LOVE STILL LEFT IN THIS WORLD. THE GREATEST BROADWAY SHOW EVER, CATS, WILL STILL BE OPEN IN MY HEART SAYS I FOX COMMENTATOR AND AUTHOR OF KILLINGS, LINCOLN JESUS KENNEDY BILL O'REILLY. WHERE WAS I? I WAS TALKING ABOUT BILL O'REILLY'S LOVE OF THE PLAY CATS. [LAUGHTER] ♪ MEMORIES OF A PLAY I SAW TWICE AT THE WINTER GARDEN OR SOME (bleep) ♪ ♪ FIVE BUCKS FOR WATER WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ♪ [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NO, I DON'T -- AT SOME POINT MY JEWISH GRANDMOTHER CHARACTER WAS PUSHED OUT OF THE WAY BY ANGRY TRUCKER AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] THE POINT IS THIS. ♪ PAPA CAN YOU HEAR ME  THE POINT IS THIS: [LAUGHTER] THAT TYPE OF SEXY MUSIC IS DESTROYING THE KIDS. IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT BEYONCE'S SEXINESS THAT HIS BILL'S DANDER UP.
WORTH ABOUT $350 MILLION. SHE PUTS OUT A NEW ALBUM WITH A VIDEO THAT GLORIFIES HAVING SEX IN THE BACK OF A LIMOUSINE.
Jon: THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT VIDEO THAT SHOWS TRULY HOW UNPLEASANT LIMOUSINE SEX CAN BE. SAFETY ISSUES, SEATBELTS, CHAFING ON THE LEATHER, THE WORRY ABOUT THE DRI -- BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOT ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU STICK TO MISSIONARY, YOU DO IT IN THE BED IN THE DARK AND THEN YOU APOLOGIZE TO GOD AFTERWARDS. LISTEN BILL, HERE IS THE THING. BILLY, BILLY, BILLY BILLY, BILLY, THAT SONG IS ABOUT TWO MARRIED INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL INDEPENDENT ENTREPRENEURS WITH A CHILD IN A STABLE RELATIONSHIP ENJOYING ONE OF THE SACRAMENTS OF MARRIAGE IN THE BACK OF A LUXURIOUS AUTOMOBILE. IF THAT'S NOT A CONSERVATIVE UTOPIA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. SO -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] -- WHAT IN GOD'S NAME -- WHAT IS REALLY THE PROBLEM HERE?
TEENAGE GIRLS LOOK UP TO BEYONCE. PARTICULARLY GIRLS OF COLOR. SHE'S AN IDOL TO THEM. I'M SAYING WHY ON EARTH WOULD THIS WOMAN DO THAT? WHY WOULD SHE DO IT WHEN SHE KNOWS THE DEVASTATION THAT UNWANTED PREGNANCIES AND FRACTURED FAMILIES, WHY WOULD BEYONCE DO THAT?
Jon: SO YOU BELIEVE THE ISSUE HERE AFTER CAREFUL STUDY IS YOU DON'T BELIEVE AMERICA IS READY FOR THIS JELLY? [LAUGHTER] FOR MORE, WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BEYONCE CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS. JESSICA , THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE'S REPORTING OUTSIDE A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL. JESSICA, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE O'REILLY BEYONCE COVERAGE --
YEAH JON, AND I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND, LOOK THE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT BEYONCE.
NO, JON, I'M DISAPPOINTED IN BEYONCE.
Jon: WHAT?
QUEEN B HAS REALLY LET ME DOWN. YOU KNOW,  I'VE BEEN LIVING MY LIFE BY HER SONGS FOLLOWING THEM TO THE LETTER, JON. I LEARNED TO BE A SURVIVOR.
Jon: THAT WAS A SONG.
HOW TO FIND A GUY TO PAY MY BILLS, BILLS, BILLS.
Jon: I RECALL THERE WAS THAT PERIOD WHERE YOU WERE GOING AROUND THE OFFICE PUTTING A RING ON EVERYTHING.
WELL, JON, IF YOU LIKE IT, THEN YOU GOTTA PUT A RING ON IT.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. LOOK, I DON'T WRITE THE RULES, I JUST LIVE BY THEM. BUT WITH THESE SEXUALIZED VIDEOS BEY SEXUALIZED VIDEOS BEY HAS TAKEN THE RULE BOOK AND TOSSED IT TO THE LEFT, TO THE LEFT. EVERYTHING. IN A BOX TO THE LEFT.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. I UNDERSTAND.
WASN'T SURE.
Jon: LET'S LOOK AT FACTS. LOOK, BEYONCE FIRST BECAME A STAR IN 1997.
RIGHT. NOVEMBER 29, DESTINY'S CHILD. NO, NO, NO PART 2. BILLBOARD TOP 100 DEBUT. LATER PEAKS AT NUMBER 3. NO BIG DEAL.
Jon: RIGHT. SINCE THEN TEEN PREGNANCY RATES IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ON A STEADY DECLINE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T JUMP THE GUN ON THOSE STATS, JON. SHE DROPPED THAT SEX ALBUM LAST DECEMBER AND SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT COME JUNE THE LINE TO AUDITION FOR TEEN MOM WILL BE JUMPIN, JUMPIN.
Jon:  JESSICA, WHY DON'T WE JUST WATCH ONE OF THE VIDEOS AND WE'LL DISCUSS ITS POSSIBLE EFFECTS. ♪ SURFBOARD
Jon: SEE, NOW BASICALLY IT SEEMS INNOCENT. SHE'S WEARING PROPER BEACH ATTIRE. TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, VIS-A-VIS THE SPORT OF SURFING. SO, UH, I JUST THINK THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ]
SO, JON, YOU DON'T THAT LIKE MOST MUSIC IT'S ABOUT (bleep)?
Jon: NO, I DON'T THINK, I IMAGINE THERE'S A DOUBLE ENTENDRE. HOLY (bleep) ARE YOU PREGNANT? WAIT, DID YOU JUST GET SIX MONTHS PREGNANT?
YEAH.
Jon: HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? WHAT JUST -- BUT, EARLIER IN THE THING AND NOW YOU ARE
I KNOW, JON, LOOK MAN, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE LIKE ME WATCHES A VERY SEXY BEYONCE VIDEO.
Jon: THAT IS CRAZY. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S FROM WATCHING THE VIDEO.
JUST CHECK OUT THIS SONOGRAM. ♪ IF YOU LIKE IT THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE ♪
