Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT. THIS GUY. THIS GUY CAN ACT. HE HAS A NEW FILM CALLED "THE RAILWAY MAN."
I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO BE ALIVE. NO, OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T. YOU THOUGHT YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT. WHY ARE YOU ALIVE?
WHY ARE WE ALIVE?
NO, YOU. WHY ARE YOU ALIVE? YOU WERE A WAR CRIMINAL, WHY DIDN'T THEY HANG YOU?
NOT A WAR CRIMINAL, JUST AN INTERPRETER.
YOU KNEW EVERYTHING. WHY DID THEY LET YOU LIVE?
Jon: THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM COLIN FIRTH. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) MY MAN! (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) THAT'S YOU RIGHT THERE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) THERE YOU GO. NICE TO SEE YOU. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  ) YOU ARE LOOKING WELL MY FRIEND.
AS YOU ARE.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: YOU ARE SO GOOD IN THIS.
THANK YOU. YOU SAW IT?
Jon: NO. NO, I DID SEE IT. IT'S PHENOMENAL. BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL. AND WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS. SO IT SORT OF FLIPS BACK AND FORTH. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE... IS IT OKAY TO SAY IT GOES FROM...
TELL THE WHOLE THING IT'S FINE. I'LL FIND OUT IF YOU ARE BLUFFING.
Jon: WORLD WAR II TO LIKE 1980. IT GOES BACK AND FORTH. WE WERE THINKING 1980 IS A PERIOD PIECE. BECAUSE THE DISTANCE OF TIME BETWEEN 1980 AND NOW IS THE SAME AMOUNT BETWEEN 1980 AND WORLD WAR II.
HURTS, DOESN'T IT?
Jon: IT REALLY...
I WAS DOING A PLAY SET IN 1952, AND I REFERRED IT TO AS A PERIOD PIECE AND MY MOTHER WAS MORTIFIED.
Jon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S MODERN HISTORY?
NO, NO. EXACTLY. THE FIRST TIME I WAS ON YOUR SHOW WOULD PROBABLY A PERIOD PIECE NOW. (  LAUGHTER  )
Jon: EXACTLY. A WOMAN ASKED ME TONIGHT WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED HERE WHAT WAS IT LIKE... I WAS LIKE WHEN DID I FIRST START? WAS IT 42? OR WAS IT 52? BUT YOU CLEARLY NOW YOU ARE IN SOME KIND OF FIGHTING SHAPE. ARE YOU DOING A BOXING MOVIE OR SOMETHING? I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU IN THIS TYPE OF FIGHTING SHAPE BEFORE?
PEOPLE SEEM TO ASSUME I WAS TRAINING FOR THIS FILM WHICH I HAD DONE THE YEAR BEFORE. I KNOW I'M SLOW TO CATCH UP ON THINGS. (  LAUGHTER  ) BUT I USUALLY TRY TO STAY A LITTLE BIT MORE AHEAD OF THINGS THAN THAT. I'M PLAYING A SPY, I'M AN ACTION HERO. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: THIS IS THE FIRST...
THEY APPLAUD BEFORE THEY'VE SEEN IT.
Jon: THIS IS EXCITING. THIS STORY, THE ONE IN THIS,  THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE PORTRAYING, THIS IS A TRUE STORY THIS IS A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS HELD IN THAILAND.
CAPTURED IN SINGAPORE, TAKEN TO THAILAND BASICALLY AS AN ARMY OF SLAVES TO DO THIS IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF BUILDING A RAILWAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE. IT WAS AN ACT OF MASS MURDER. AND MORE THAN 100,000 PEOPLE DID DIE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. IT'S THE MOST EXTREME BRUTALITY YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE. HE SURVIVED IT. HE, LIKE MOST PEOPLE, VETERANS OF THAT EXPERIENCE, BOTTLED IT UP FOR DECADES. HE THRIVED ON HATRED. HE WANTED VENGENCE.
Jon: WELL, THIS IS ABOUT THE TRAUMA, THE P.T.S.D. THAT HE EXPERIENCES IN FLASHBACKS.
EXACTLY, WHICH PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE A NAME AT THE TIME. HE FOUND RATHER MIRACULOUSLY FOUND THE GUY HE WAS LOOKING FOR. FOUND HIM TO STILL BE ALIVE AND WENT OUT TO KILL HIM. THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO THE SCENE YOU SAW THERE.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU HOW THAT SCENE ENDS. IT'S PHENOMENAL. (  LAUGHTER  ) THE GENTLEMAN IS NO LONGER WITH US, BUT HIS WIFE IS. YOU MET HER.
I MET THEM BOTH. ERIC PASSED AWAY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.
Jon: OH, I DIDN'T REALIZE.
AND I GOT TO KNOW HIM. YOU KNOW, IT BECOMES VERY PERSONAL.
Jon: ABSOLUTELY. IT'S NOT JUST A JOB AT THAT POINT. PATTY HAS BEEN HERE IN NEW YORK TALKING ABOUT THE FILM WITH US. YOU KNOW, IT'S...
Jon: WAS THAT THE PERSON WHOSE APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL WAS MOST...
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: ...IN THE FRONT OF YOUR MIND.
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: WHEN THAT WAS DELIVERED TO YOU IN I'M ASSUMING A POSITIVE FASHION BECAUSE SHE'S STILL WITH THE THING, WAS THAT A WEIGHT OFF YOUR SHOULDERS?
A WEIGHT OFF AND THEN ON. BECAUSE OF COURSE, IF SHE HAD WITHHELD APPROVAL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW WE WOULD HAVE GOT GOING. THE FACT THAT WE WERE THEN TRUSTED TO TAKE THIS PRECIOUS STORY. AND THE REASON IT'S PRECIOUS IS THAT OUT OF THIS WALL OF SILENCE THIS MAN SPOKE. AND IT WAS AT GREAT COST TO HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. HE WAS SPEAKING FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN AND HE'S SAYING OVER TO YOU. A GUY TO WHOM NOTHING HAS HAPPENED EVER.
Jon: I HEARD YOU WENT JOGGING ONCE.
I WENT JOGGING AND SOMEBODY WAS MEAN TO ME AT SCHOOL ONCE. (  LAUGHTER  ) SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I HAD TO DRAW ON. AND, YOU KNOW, TO TAKE THIS HUGE STORY AND YOU'VE GOT 90 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME TO BE TRUE TO IT WAS... IT WAS AN INCENTIVE BUT, YEAH THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT ON ONE SHOULDER.
Jon: BEAUTIFULLY DONE, MY FRIEND. REALLY, REALLY. AS ALWAYS WITH YOUR STUFF EXCEPT FOR THIS NEW ONE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT SOUNDS (  BLEEP  ) TERRIBLE. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. (  LAUGHTER  ) "THE RAILWAY MAN" IT OPENS IN NEW YORK AND LA ON FRIDAY AND EVERYWHERE APRIL 18. COLIN FIRTH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
