Jon: THAT'S OUR SHOW, BEFORE WE GO, QUICK THING, AS YOU KNOW, FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT, THIS FEATURE FILM,  IT WAS WHY I WAS GONE LAST SUMMER. AND I LEFT THE SHOW TO BE HOSTED BY JOHN OLIVER, WHO WAS SO BAD AT IT, I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER BEEN HEARD FROM AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. I THINK HE'S OUT OF THE BUSINESS. BUT THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A FRIEND, A JOURNALIST, MAZIAR BAHARI. THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT HELD HIM CAPTIVE IN 2009 FOR REPORTING ON THE IRANIAN PEOPLE'S HISTORIC PROTEST FOR FREEDOM THERE. AND WHILE HE WAS IN TEHRAN, MAZIAR HAD ALSO TAPED A "DAILY SHOW" INTERVIEW WITH OUR OWN JASON JONES, AND WHO, AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS FUNNY, IRAN'S GOVERNMENT THEN ACCUSED OF BEING AN AMERICAN SPY. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE LAUGH THEY HAD WHEN THEY REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE, AND BY LAUGH I MEAN BRUTAL INTERROGATION OF MAZIAR FOR WEEKS. MAZIAR WROTE THIS INCREDIBLE BOOK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE. WE TURNED IT INTO A FILM WITH THE INCREDIBLE GAEL GARCIA BERNAL AS MAZIAR. IT'S GOING TO COME OUT IN NOVEMBER, BUT THE TRAILER IS BEING RELEASED TODAY. IT OCCURRED TO ME SINCE I HAVE A NIGHTLY TELEVISION SHOW... [LAUGHTER] I COULD MENTION IT AND SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF SCENES THAT AREN'T IN THE TRAILER BUT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SORT OF WHY WE GOT INVOLVED. THIS IS A QUICK ONE FROM THE MOVIE, IT'S A RE-ENACTMENT OF MAZIAR AND JASON'S INTERVIEW IN TEHRAN.
ACTUALLY AMERICANS AND IRANIANS HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON MORE THAN THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES.
WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON WITH YOU?
WHAT IS THE NUMBER-ONE ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES?
AL QAEDA.
AL QAEDA IS ALSO THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY OF IRAN. THE AL QAEDA MEMBERS SAY THAT IF YOU KILL AN IRANIAN OR IF YOU KILL A SHIITE, YOU GO TO HEAVEN AND YOU GET 72 VIRGINS.
WELL, THEY WON'T BE VIRGINS FOR TOO LONG, HUH? RIGHT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? UPSTAIRS.  [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT'S JASON JONES, VERY TALENTED ACTOR, AND IT'S WHY HERE WE MOSTLY HAVE HIM PUTTING HIS PENIS INTO CANTALOUPES. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DO THAT. WE REALLY HAVE TO UTILIZE HIM BETTER. AND, SO TO JUST GIVE YOU A SENSE, THIS IS MAZIAR IN PRISON AND HIS INTERROGATOR IS CONFRONTING HIM WITH THIS DAMNING EVIDENCE.
SIR, YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. I AM A JOURNALIST. THAT'S IT. NOTHING MORE.
JUST A JOURNALIST.
YES.
AS A SPY, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY YOUR COUNTRY IS SO TERRIFYING.
FIRST THING TO KNOW ABOUT IRAN IS THAT IT IS NOT EVEN. AMERICANS AND IRANIANS HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON MORE THAN THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES.
WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON WITH YOU?
SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHY JUST A JOURNALIST WOULD MEET UP WITH THIS AMERICAN SPY.
HE'S NOT A SPY.
HE'S NOT A SPY?
NO, IT'S A SHOW.
IT'S A SHOW?
IT'S A COMEDY SHOW.  IT'S SUPPOSED TO, IT'S STUPID.
IT'S VERY STUPID, YES.
HE'S A COMEDIAN PRETENDING TO BE A SPY.
SO CAN YOU TELL ME WHY AN AMERICAN PRETENDING TO BE A SPY HAS CHOSEN TO INTERVIEW YOU?
AND WHY WOULD A REAL SPY HAVE A TV SHOW? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: AND THEN SHAQUILLE O'NEAL COMES IN AND SAVES THE DAY DRESSED AS A WIZARD. IT GETS THAT IN THERE. BOY, IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE THE TRAILER IS AVAILABLE NOW ON ITUNES. I REALLY HOPE YOU LIKE IT. WE'RE REAL PROUD OF IT. AND I HOPE WHEN IT COMES OUT YOU GET CHANCE TO SEE IT AND LIKE IT. ANYWAY, HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
TEXAS IS A PRETTY RED STATE NOW. BUT I REFER TO TRAVIS COUNTY AS THE BLUEBERRY IN THE TOMATO SOUP. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
