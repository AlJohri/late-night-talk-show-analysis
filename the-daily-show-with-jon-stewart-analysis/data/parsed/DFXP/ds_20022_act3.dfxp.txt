Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. WE ARE TALKING WITH SAMANTHA POWER. SHE IS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS. THE OTHER BIG FIGHT ON EVERYBODY'S FEAR GRAPHICS ON THE 24-HOUR NETWORKS IS WITH I.S.I.S., WHO WE HAVE MADE INTO AN X-MEN-LIKE ORGANIZATION OF SUPERPOWERS THAT THE U.S. MUST STAND UP TO AS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. IS THAT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OVER AT THE UNITED NATIONS? WHAT'S THE SENSE THERE AND WHAT ARE THE COUNTRIES THERE DOING ABOUT IT?
THERE IS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT I THINK FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, I.S.I.S. IS TERRIFYING.
Jon: RIGHT.
THEY'RE EXECUTING CHRISTIANS, THE YAZIDIS, SHIAS, SUNNIS --
Jon: RIGHT. BUT THEY'RE THUGS. THEY'RE NOT, THEY'RE NOT, THEY DON'T HAVE POWER. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE AN AIR FORCE.
CORRECT, WHICH IS HELPFUL. (LAUGHTER) BUT THEY HAVE HEAVY WEAPONRY OF A KIND WE HAVEN'T SEEN A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION CONTROL BEFORE.
Jon: RIGHT, WELL, IT WAS OURS.
YES. CORRECT. SOME. SOME. BUT THEY ALSO CONTROL TERRITORY AND JUST AGAIN, IF YOU'RE IN THEIR PATH...
Jon: OH, IT'S TERRIBLE,
JUST IMAGINE. SO AMERICANS WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE PATH AND HAVE, OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF OUR TWO JOURNALISTS.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND SO THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THEY WILL KEEP ON THEIR MARCH IF THEY'RE NOT STOPPED AND IT TAKES U.S. LEADERSHIP TO MOBILIZE AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO SUPPORT THE IRAQIS TO DO THE STOPPING.
Jon: WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE IF EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THIS IS A THREAT, WHY DOES IT TAKE U.S. LEADERSHIP AND WHY TO WE HAVE TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THAT AND WHY IS IT WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT, SO YOU KNOW, WE'RE ON IT, GO BACK TO WATCHING "THE GOOD WIFE?" YOU KNOW, THE RHETORIC DOESN'T SEEM TO MATCH THE REALITY IN SOME RESPECTS.
WELL, U.S. LEADERSHIP IS CRITICAL AND HAS PROVEN CRITICAL IN MOBILIZING A COALITION THAT IS WAY BIGGER THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST STEPPED FORWARD AND DECLARED IT A THREAT. WE HAVE ARAB COALITION PARTNERS, WE HAVE THE U.K., WE HAVE THE FRENCH, WE HAVE THE DANES, WE HAVE THE BELGIANS. WE HAVE, IT'S A GENUINE COALITION. AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT. IT IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL THREAT. BUT IT IS ALSO NOT AN OPTION TO ALLOW THESE GUYS TO JUST HANG OUT AND PLOT THEIR NEXT MOVE. THE OTHER THING IF I MAY JUST...
Jon: YEAH.
THE FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTING PIECE OF THIS IS THE OTHER REASON WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH BACKING FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING.
Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. THAT RHETORIC IS TH IS IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT, IT SEEMS LIKE WE WOULD DO MORE. IF YOU WANT TO SAY TO A COUNTRY OR TO THE WORLD, THIS IS A THREAT TO THE WORLD'S EXISTENCE, BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO PUT GROUND TROOPS IN AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO LOB SOME STRATEGIC BOMBS SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE COALITION.
I TAKE THE POINT. I THINK THAT WHAT WE RECOGNIZE IS THAT IT HAS TO BE IRAQI-LED AND ULTIMATELY IN SYRIA IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SYRIAN FIGHTERS ON THE GROUND WHO TAKE ON I.S.I.L. WE'VE HAVE INVESTED AN AWFUL LOT THROUGH OUR GROUND PRESENCE IN IRAQ OVER THE MANY, MANY YEARS, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, SO MANY LIVES LOST AND STILL ENDED UP WITH I.S.I.L ON THE BACK END. SO THE INVESTMENT IS THROUGH THE IRAQIS, WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BEHIND US...
Jon: RIGHT. THAT'S NOT GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD, THOUGH? WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT THE INVESTMENT OF THE PAST TEN YEARS WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE INVESTMENT OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS?
WELL, ASKING THE QUESTION THE OTHER WAY, WHAT GIVES US ANY CONFIDENCE THAT BY HANGING BACK THIS THREAT WON'T METASTASIZE ACROSS THE REGION.
Jon: NOT, NOT, THAT MEANING WHY WOULDN'T WE BRING IN, WHY CAN'T SAUDI ARABIA, WHY CAN'T THE OTHER NATIONS WITHIN THERE WITH POWERFUL MILITARIES TAKE CARE OF THIS?
YEAH. WELL, I THINK WE HAVE MORE SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST EFFORTS, SO THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IT HAS TO BE SUSTAINED. THERE ARE VERY DELICATE, AS YOU KNOW, SECTARIAN DYNAMICS AT WORK AND SO MAINTAINING THIS COALITION IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS EFFORT, IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE GOING IN THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A MULTI-YEAR EFFORT. WE RECOGNIZE GOING IN, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE IRAQI FORCES WEREN'T ABLE TO CONTEST THIS THREAT WHEN IT APPEARED, HOW MUCH MORE WORK WE HAVE TO DO ON THE TRAINING SIDE. BUT AGAIN WE DO HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES COMING IN, WE HAVE GOVERNMENT STEPPING UP TO TRY TO PREVENT THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS WITH GREATER ENERGY THAN THEY SADLY BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
Jon: WHEN YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY, WEL WE'RE GOING SEND IN SOME MORE ADVISORS. WELL, HOW MANY? WELL, ABOUT 3,000. YOU KNOW, IT GETS REAL VIETNAM-Y TO ME. IT GETS REAL, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO SEND IN 3,000 ADVISORS, THAT'S A LOT OF ADVICE. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK, YOU KNOW, 1,000 ADVISORS, OKAY. THE OTHER 2,000, THEY'RE PROBABLY TROOPS.
NO. WHEN WE SAY ADD ADVISORS, THEY'RE ADVISORS. I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT TROOPS BEING DEPLOYED.
Jon: LIKE SHOOT THAT GUY -- LIKE THAT KIND OF ADVICE? (LAUGHTER) WHAT? WHAT DO THEY DO? HOW DO THEY -- WHAT DO THEY ADVISE?
WELL, THE FORCES HAVE, IN CERTAIN AREAS, HAVE DISSOLVED, SO PART OF IT IS RECONSTITUTION. PART OF IT IS...
Jon: THE IRAQI FORCES?
THE IRAQI FORCES IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. I MEAN, THEY HIGH-TAILED IT OUT OF, YOU KNOW, MAJOR TOWNS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF IRAQ SO WE'RE RECONSTITUTING FORCES AND ALSO THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT MODELS FOR DECENTRALIZED SECURITY APPROACHES. THE THE MODEL BEFORE WASCENTRALIZED, IT WAS AN IRAQI ARMY AND GIVEN THE LOYALTIES AS THEY'VE EMERGED, THEY TEND TO BE MORE LOCAL
Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A SUNNI SORT AWAKENING BEEN THE ANBAR PROVINCE THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF GOVERNANCE SORT OF LIKE A CONFEDERATION.
AS WAS DONE BEFORE BUT WHAT WAS DONE BEFORE THEN WASN'T COMPLEMENTED BY LEADERSHIP IN BAGHDAD THAT MADE THOSE PEOPLE FEEL WELCOMED.
Jon: CONGRESS, YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THEM TO HAVE A ROLE IN THIS. THEY APPEAR NOT TO WANT TO DEAL WITH IT. THEY WERE ON RECESS WHEN WE BEGAN THE OPERATION. I'M NOT SURE WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. ARE THEY -- DO THEY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY? IS THAT ROLE A HELPFUL ROLE AND HOW MUCH DO YOU HATE THOSE GUYS? (LAUGHTER)
LET ME ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ALL RIGHT! (APPLAUSE)
THEY HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. I MEAN,  I HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE U.N. AND WHEN I TRAVEL OVERSEAS JUST HOW MUCH MORE POWERFUL OUR MESSAGE IS AND OUR LEADERSHIP IS WHEN THERE'S A SENSE THAT THE CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEHIND US. SO I THINK THIS IS THE SEASON AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL SEE CONGRESS ACT IN SUPPORT OF THE EFFORT THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING BOTH IN TERMS OF I.S.I.L AND EBOLA WHERE REAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO BE DEPLOYED.
Jon: IN YOUR ANSWER I SEE SOMETHING.
DIPLOMACY?
Jon: BOY OH BOY, YOU'RE NOT KIDDING. THAT WAS SUPER DIPLOMACY. THAT WAS AMBASSADOR-IFIC.
THANK YOU.
Jon: BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
THANK YOU.
AND CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK, AND I HOPE THINGS WORK OUT ESPECIALLY IN THE AFRICAN REGION. AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER. THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
THANK YOU. ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
