Jon: WELCOME BACK. NOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BEFORE THE BREAK WE WERE DISCUSSING THE LATEST IN AMERICAN NONRACISM. NOW WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE. LARRY WILMORE. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. YES!
OH, MAN, HOLY (bleep) JON. WHAT A WEEK TO BE SENIOR BLACK CORRESPONDENT. I GOT ON A PLANE TO COME OUT HERE AND TALK ABOUT CLIVEN BUNDY BY THE TIME I LANDED, DONALD STERLING WAS BLOWING UP. I MEAN, IN ONE NEWS CYCLE WE HAVE LIBERTARIAN  COWBOY RACISTS, OLD JEWISH SPORTS RACISTS AND DUDES BRAGGING ABOUT THEIR BLACK FRIENDS THROUGH A KKK HOOD. MWAH.
Jon: IT'S A RICH TAPESTRY. I'M GLAD YOU ARE ENJOYING YOURSELF. BUT LARRY, WHY IS THE CONVERSATION SO EXPLOSIVE? WHY IS THE RACE CONVERSATION SO FRAUGHT RIGHT NOW?
YEAH WELL, JON, WHILE MINORITIES ARE MAD FOR THE OBVIOUS REASONS, STOP AND FRISK, UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITIES, VOTER SUPPRESSION --
Jon: OK. AND THEN UH, OH, YOU'RE NOT DONE --
YOU KNOW, UNFAIR SENTENCING LAWS, TRAYVON MARTIN, STEALING OUR MUSIC.
Jon: SURE.
DIABETES.  I GOT IT, NON-WHITES ARE MAD BUT WHAT ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE, LARRY, THEY SEEM EVEN MORE ANGRY YET THEY ARE NOT SUFFERING FROM THIS RACISM?
WELL, OTHER THAN WHITE PEOPLE BEING CRAZY, I THINK --
Jon: WAIT WHAT?
I THINK IT'S THE FEAR THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE GAINING SOMETHING AT THEIR EXPENSE AND THEY HAVE SOME VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT THEORIES ABOUT IT.
I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT THE NEGRO BECAUSE THEY WERE BASICALLY ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY. SO NOW WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY ABORT THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN, THEY PUT YOUR YOUNG MEN IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY NEVER LEARNED HOW TO PICK COTTON.
UM, I WANT TO TELL CLIVEN BUNDY ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT THE NEGRO. OUR TWO CHOICES IN LIFE ARE NOT BETWEEN PICKING COTTON AND PICKING UP WELFARE CHECKS. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS BLACK SO (bleep) YOU.
Jon: REASONABLE STATEMENT.
NO, NO, NO, OK. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES I'LL GO THERE COWBOY. REMEMBER THE HOMESTEAD ACT WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU DON'T BELIEVE EXISTS TOLD YOUR ANCESTORS THEY COULD HAVE ALL THE LAND FOR AS FAR AS THEY COULD GET IN A DAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY TOLD MY AND SETTERS? HOW FAR CAN YOU GET IN A DAY?
Jon: SO THE PIONEER SELF-SUFFICIENT WE BUILT IT AMERICAN WEST WAS BASICALLY A GIANT WELFARE PROGRAM.
YEP, BUNDY GREW UP IN A CULTURE OF DEPENDENCY. IT'S NO WONDER HE TURNED INTO A THUG. BUT I FEEL BAD FOR HIM, JON. I MEAN, AT THIS POINT EVEN RICK PERRY HAS CONDEMNED HIS RACISM AND THAT GUY HAS A RANCH CALLED NIGGER HEAD.
Jon: WOW. WHAT ABOUT DONALD STERLING, THOUGH? THIS MAN IS RICH. HE'S WEALTHY BEYOND BELIEF. HIS LIFE IS FINE. HE'S GREAT. WHERE'S THE RESENTMENT THERE? WHAT IS HIS PROBLEM?
WELL, JON, HE HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. RACISTS LIKE HIM ARE NOT WORRIED THEY ARE GOING TO PASS THEM. THEY'RE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE AND NEED THEM TO STAY IN THEIR PLACE.
Jon: AND APPARENTLY THAT PLACE DOES NOT INCLUDE STANDING NEXT TO HIS GIRLFRIEND IN AN INSTAGRAM PHOTO.
REALLY? REALLY? MAGIC JOHNSON ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO BE SEEN WITH YOUR MIXED RACE MISTRESS. I MEAN, MAGIC JOHNSON A MAN SO UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED EVEN H.I.V. DOESN'T WANT TO BRING HIM DOWN. MAGIC.
Jon: I MEAN IT'S TRUE. I DON'T GET IT IT'S MAGIC JOHNSON. I DON'T GET IT.
AND JON, LISTEN TO HOW STERLING TALKS ABOUT HIS PLAYERS.
I SUPPORT THEM GIVING THEM FOOD AND CLOTHES AND CARS AND HOUSES. WHO GIVES IT TO THEM? DOES SOMEONE ELSE GIVE IT TO THEM?
WOW, THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU BOAST ABOUT FROM THE PORCH OF YOUR PLANTATION RIGHT BEFORE DJANGO SHOOTS YOU.
Jon: BUT THAT'S WHAT, HERE'S WHAT'S MIND -- THIS VIRULENT RACIST IS DATING A WOMAN OF COLOR.
I DON'T KNOW IF DATING IS THE RIGHT WORD, JON. HE'S MORE OF A SUGAR BIGOT. AND BESIDES, HE'S JUST CARRYING ON A GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION. LOOK, WE RESPECT THOMAS JEFFERSON BUT (bleep) MAY HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY IF SALLY HEMMINGS HAD INSTAGRAM. I TOLD YOU DO NOT BRING KUNTA KINTE TO MY GAMES.
Jon: WHAT FILTER IS THAT. WHAT INSTAGRAM FILTER?
70'S.
Jon: 70'S? IS IT?
1770'S.
Jon: ALRIGHT, WELL IN YOUR MIND, WHAT SHOULD THE CONSEQUENCES BE FOR STERLING?
OK, JON, NOW. I'VE GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT. WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. CHRIS PAUL HAS TO COME PLAY FOR THE LAKERS.
Jon: WAIT WHAT? I KNOW YOU ARE A LAKERS FAN BUT THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION?
YES, YES JON. I'LL CALL THE NAACP.
Jon: WHAT IS THE NAACP GOING TO DO.
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF CHRIS PAUL TO THE LAKERS. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S RIGHT. CHRIS, YOU NEED TO ESCAPE. LOOK, WAIT UNTIL DARK AND THEN GO TO THE NORTH SIDE OF STAPLE CENTER TO THE LAKERS LOCKER ROOM.
Jon: HOW DOES THIS FIX THE RACISM PROBLEM?
DON'T BE SILLY. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIX RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I'M A LAKERS FAN AND WE CAN FIX BASKETBALL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
Jon: THANK YOU, LARRY. NICELY DONE, SIR. LARRY WILMORE, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
