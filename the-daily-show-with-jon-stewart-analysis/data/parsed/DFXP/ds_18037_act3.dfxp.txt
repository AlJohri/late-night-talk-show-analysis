Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE'S THE MAYOR  OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  MAYOR CORY BOOKER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. YOU GOT A LOT OF JERSEY COMING  ON RECENTLY.
Jon: TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF  JERSEY. YOU KNOW, I'M FROM THE AREA.
I KNOW.
Jon: BORN IN NEW YORK CITY,  RAISED IN NEW JERSEY. WERE YOU BORN IN NEWARK?
I'M LIKE YOU, BORN IN  WASHINGTON, D.C.,, PROVED TO  JERSEY WHEN I WAS A FEW MONTHS  OLD.
JON: SO LIVED...
LIVED IN BERGEN COUNTY, SMALL  TOWN CALLED HARRINGTON PARK.
Jon: BEAUTIFUL HARRINGTON  PARK. VERY NICE. AND NOW YOU ARE THE SUPERHERO  MAYOR OF NEWARK. I READ STORIES ABOUT YOU. YOU PULL BABIES OUT OF BURNING  BUILDINGS. YOU HAVE REVERSED THE ROTATION  OF THE EARTH. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN TO YOU? DO YOU PATROL AT NIGHT? ARE YOU FILMING AN EPISODE OF  COPS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I DID PA TERRELL AT NIGHT A  LOT, ESPECIALLY WHEN I FIRST GOT  IN AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CHANGE WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IN THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT. I GET A LOT OF ATTENTION FOR  THINGS FRANKLY A LOT OF PEOPLE  IN MY CITY DO EVERY DAY. I REMEMBER DURING HURRICANE  SANDY I LET A LOT OF MY  NEIGHBORS STAY IN MY HOUSE UNTIL MY POWER CAME BACK ON, AND I GOT  A LOT OF ATTENTION, BUT FRANKLY,  SO MANY PEOPLE WERE DOING THINGS LIKE THAT.
Jon: BUT YOU'RE THE MAYOR.
I AM THE MAYOR.
Jon: SO YOUR HOUSE IS  NICER. [LAUGHTER]
IF YOU SAW HOW THIS BACHELOR  GUY LIVES, YOU WOULD NOT  NECESSARILY SAY THAT.
Jon: IS THAT TRUE? DOES THE MAYOR NOT HAVE SOMEONE  TO COME -- BY THE WAY, I SEE A  GREAT SIT COME. HOLD ON. "THE BACHELOR" MAYOR OF NEWARK.
NO. THE NEWS FOCUSES SO MUCH ON  NEGATIVITY, BAD BEHAVIOR,  REALITY TV EXPOSES THAT, THE HEART OF THIS COUNTRY, YOU KNOW  THIS, THE HEART OF NEW JERSEY IS  GOOD FOLKS WHO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN. AND THEIR OWN REALLY HAS  EXPANDED BEYOND THEIR FAMILIES.
Jon: ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS  THAT CAME BY IN THE STORM, HAVE  YOU CONTINUED A RELATIONSHIP? ANY OF THEM YOU THINK TO  YOURSELF, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO  HIS HOUSE ON HALLOWEEN? ANYBODY FREAK YOU OUT?
NOT AT ALL. I'M VERY, VERY LUCKY. I WAS VISITING SOME FRIENDS LAST  NIGHT, AS WELL. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD CITY. NEWARK, AS YOU KNOW, HAS LONG  BEEN DISRESPECTED AND DISSED,  BUT THE REALITY IS IT'S AN AMAZING CITY MAKING A STRONG  COMEBACK.
Jon: PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE  STRUGGLE. OTHER THAN, LET'S SAY PATTERSON,  MAYBE CAMDEN ESPECIALLY, NEWARK  HAS FACED SOME OF THE MOST DIRE CHALLENGES AND HAS FOUGHT ITS  WAY BACK IN A WAY THAT A LOT OF  OTHER CITIES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO.
ABSOLUTELY. THE BENEFIT WHEN YOU SEE A CITY  COME BACK IS THE REGION DOES  BETTER.
Jon: SURE.
AND IT BECOMES AN ENGINE OF  ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. NEWARK PRODUCES HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF JOBS FOR OUR  REGION, ESPECIALLY IF YOU INCLUDE OUR PORT AREA.
Jon: AS PART OF THE  COMEBACK EFFORT, IS THAT WHY YOU  HAD TO GET RID OF THE NETS? I'M A KNICKS' FAN?
JERSEY NEEDS A TEAM, WE  SHOULD START ONE. YOU COULD PLAY POINT.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, I COULD  PLAY POINT ON THE WASHINGTON  GENERALS. ANOTHER THING YOU'VE DONE  RECENTLY, YOU'VE STARTED LIVING  ON WHAT'S CALLED THE SNAP PROGRAM, WHICH IS A FOOD STAMP  PROGRAM. YOU DECIDED TO LIVE FOR A WEEK  ON ONLY WHAT THE CITY OR THE  STATE AFFORDS YOU FOR FOOD  STAMPS.
ABOUT $1.40 A MEAL. GOT INTO A FIGHT ON TWITTER WITH  SOMEBODY SAYING THE TWITTER...
Jon: SORRY, YOU GOT INTO A  FIGHT OVER TWITTER.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU'RE ON TWITTER?
I AM VERY MUCH ON TWITTER. IT'S ANOTHER TOOL I HAVE TO  COMMUNICATE WITH VOTERS, AND I  HAVE ABOUT A MILLION THREE  FOLLOWERS.
Jon: OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T IMAGINE. LIKE "I GOT TO GO CHECK MY  FACEBOOK PAGE."  "HEY, WHO IS THAT SON OF A BITCH  WHO POKED ME? HEY, COME ON."  SO YOU COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY ON  TWITTER WITH CONSTITUENTS?
YEP.
Jon: DON'T THEY JUST FLOOD  YOU WITH VITRIOL?
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S THE JOB OF A PUBLIC  LEADER. YOU DEAL WITH COMPLAINTS AND  PEOPLE WHO ARE ANGRY, BUT YOU  FIND PEOPLE WILL HELP YOU HELP THE CITY. SO I FIND OUT ABOUT WATER MAIN  BREAKS BEFORE MY STAFF DOES. I FIND OUT ABOUT POTHOLES. IN THIS CASE IT TURNED OUT TO BE  A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY WHEN WE  TALKED ABOUT NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND HOW ONE PERSON SAID THE  GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T BE  INVOLVED. I SAID THEY SHOULD. LET'S TRY. THESE PROGRAMS AREN'T LAVISHING  WITH PEOPLE IN THE LAP OF  LUXURY.
Jon: THE WHOLE IDEA IS THE  MOOCHERS OF SOCIETY ARE LIVING  FAT OFF...
THIS WAS A WEEK THAT WAS  HARD, DIFFICULT, BUT THE BIGGER  ISSUE FOR ME IS WE NEED TO START UNDERSTANDING IN AMERICA, AND I  THINK THIS IS PLACE WHERE LEFT  AND RIGHT CAN COME TOGETHER, THAT IF A FAMILY FAILS, WE  ALL... IT'S A DETRIMENT TO US  ALL. IF A CHILD FAILS, WE'RE BEREFT  OF THE GENIUS OF A KID. IF A PERSON FALLS INTO DRUG  ADDICTION, WE ALL HURT FROM THAT  BECAUSE OF THE CRIME, BECAUSE OF THE COST TO OUR HOSPITALS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE DON'T  UNDERSTAND, THE INTERDEPENDENCE  OF OUR SOCIETIES.
Jon: SOCIETIES HAVE NEVER  BEEN PARTICULARLY GOOD AT  PREVENTATIVE ACTION. HUMAN NATURE IS TO REACT TO A  CRISIS RATHER THAN TO GET OUT IN  FRONT OF IT. ISN'T THAT A DIFFICULT JOB FOR  POLITICIANS TO GET PEOPLE IN  FRONT OF IT?
THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY. I WAS IN SEATTLE AT AN  AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLACE THAT  WORKED ON SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, GETTING HOMELESS OFF THE  STREETS. THEY DID STUDIES. THEY TOOK 23 PEOPLE, PUT THEM  INTO SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, CUT $1  MILLION OFF OF THE BILLS OF THE EMERGENCY ROOMS. WE DID IT IN NEWARK. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER RIGHT AND  LEFT, THE MANHATTAN INSTITUTE, A  RIGHT-LEANING THINK-TANK AND SAID LET'S KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF  PRISON INSTEAD OF A 65%  RECIDIVISM RATE. YOU HAVE THE LARGEST PRISON  POPULATION IN THE GLOBE.
Jon: ISN'T THE REVERSE  THEORY IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE  ALONE AND HELPLESS, THEN THEY WILL BUILD THEIR OWN HOMES AND  FOOD. [LAUGHTER]
HONESTLY, AS MUCH AS WE LIKE  TO JOKE, TO ME I THINK WE CAN  PULL OUR COUNTRY RIGHT AND LEFT TOGETHER ON THESE ISSUES. WE'VE CREATED A PILOT...
IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY IT'S A  CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. MAYBE THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IS  WHAT THE BALANCE WILL BE, BUT  THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DOWN ON THEIR LUCK OR SUFFERING  WOULDN'T HAVE A SOCIAL SAFETY  NET THAT WE ALL CONTRIBUTE TO...
BUT IT'S MORE THAN A SOCIAL  SAFETY NET. IT'S MORE THAN A SOCIAL SAFETY  NET. I CHALLENGE THAT METAPHOR. IF YOU EMPOWER SOMEBODY TO  SUCCEED AND THAT CHILD BECOMES A  BIOLOGIST, AN ENTREPRENEUR, IT GROWS OUR ECONOMY. WE ALL BENEFIT. WE'VE SAVED THE STATE OF NEW  JERSEY ONE SMALL RE-ENTRY  PROGRAM FOR GUYS THAT PEOPLE TURNED AND THEIR BACK ON, A PROM  THAT HELPS THEM IF THEY HAVE  DRUG ADDICTION, HELPS THEM IF THEY NEED JOBS, HELPS THEM RAISE  THEIR KID WITH PARENTING  CLASSES, THAT ONE PROGRAM BY CUTTING THE RECIDIVISM RATE HAS  SAVED THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE CAN CHARGE OUR COUNTRY UP IF  WE BRING PEOPLE TO AN  UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE ALL SUCCEED, WE ALL SUCCEED MORE.
Jon: STICK AROUND FOR A  LITTLE BIT. WHEN WE COME BACK, I WILL BREAK  THROUGH YOUR VENEER OF OPTIMISM.
IMPOSSIBLE.
Jon: MAYOR CORY BOOKER.
