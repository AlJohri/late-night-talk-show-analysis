Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE'S GOT A NEW FILM OUT. IT'S CALLED DRAFT DAY.
HOW DOES A GIRL LIKE YOU GET IN THIS GAME, ANYWAY?
LAW SCHOOL.
LAWYER. SO YOU DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT ANYTHING.
IF I DO MY JOB AND WE HAVEN'T SPENT MORE THAN $125 MILLION ON PLAYERS BY THE TIME THIS SEASON STARTS, I GET EXCITED.
MIND IF I SIT DOWN.
I'M BUSY.
WON'T TAKE LONG. I COULD USE YOUR HELP. THE BROWNS BROUGHT ME TO CLEVELAND SO THAT EVERYBODY COULD GET ONE OF THESE.
HOW IS IT THAT THE ULTIMATE PRIZE IN THE MOST MACHO SPORT EVER INVENTED IS A PIECE OF JEWELRY.
Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT. PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, JENNIFER GARNER. VERY NICE. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD.
WHAT HAPPENED THERE.? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
A PIECE OF JEWELRY FALLING OFF. OK.
HOW DOES THAT, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?
IT'S BORROWED SO I MEAN, YOU KNOW. STILL --
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? HERE IS WHAT I DO IF I'M JENNIFER GARNER. I POCKET THAT (bleep). I DON'T GIVE IT BACK FOR A SECOND. [LAUGHTER] LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. THIS IS A PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE THING ON THIS PERFECT DAY. OUR GOOD FRIEND STEPHEN COLBERT.
I KNOW. SO EXCITING.
Jon: IS BEING ELEVATED TO TRULY ONE OF MOST DISTINGUISHED POSITIONS IN ALL OF TELEVISION. YOU HAVE A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. COULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE IT FOR US.
YOU READY?
Jon: I'M READY.
I USED TO BABYSIT FOR STEPHEN COLBERT'S KIDS!
Jon: BOOM! BOOM! HERE IS WHAT IS WEIRD ABOUT THAT. STEPHEN COLBERT HAS GOT TO BE LIKE 20 YEARS OLDER, THE FACT THAT YOU BABYSAT FOR HIM, I FIND IT A LITTLE WEIRD.
STEPHEN AND I, WE WERE GUEST STARS ON SPIN CITY AT THE SAME TIME, FOREVER AGO. I HAD MAYBE SIX LINES AND BUT HE HAD FOUR. WE HAD ALL OF THIS TIME TO HANG OUT TOGETHER CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SAID OH WE'RE DONE WITH THOSE FOOLS LET'S LET THEM GO FOR THE DAY. THEY JUST FORGOT ABOUT US FOR THE WHOLE TIME. SO WE WERE JUST DOWN HANGING OUT, AND AT THE END, HE WAS LIKE, YOU SEEM NORMAL. [LAUGHTER] WOULD YOU BABYSIT? SO MY ROOMMATE AND I BABY SAT FOR LITTLE MADELEINE.
Jon: YOU RAISED THAT KID RIGHT. THE OTHER ONES, TOO SMART AS WHIPS. HE'S GOT THREE OF THEM NOW. WHEN YOU WERE OVER THERE DID YOU PEG STEPHEN FOR GREATNESS? WAS THERE SOMETHING WITHIN HIM OR DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF SURE, $10 AN HOUR, FINE.
I WAS NOT MAKING $10 AN HOUR I'M SURE OF IT.
Jon: REALLY?
HE IS SO CHEAP, RIGHT?
Jon: BOOM! BOOM! YES. I LOVE IT.
I'M SURE HE STILL OWES ME. I DON'T THINK HE EVER TIPPED ME. NO, I DON'T EVER REMEMBER.
Jon: THIS IS TRULY ONE OF GREATEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH, HE DID USED TO HAVE -- IT SEEMED TO ME AND MY ROOMMATE KARINA, WE USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. THAT HE WAS COBBLING IT TOGETHER. HE WAS DOING A LITTLE WRITING HERE. HE HAD A LOT GOING ON.
Jon: THE MAN HAS PAID HIS DUES AND COULDN'T BE IN REALITY A GENTLER NICER PERSON. LIKE DOWN TO EARTH.
SO NICE. SO MUCH FUN. IF YOU EVER HAVE TO BE A GUEST STAR ON A SHOW WHERE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO YOU WANT IT TO BE WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. Jon: NO QUESTION. OR IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BLOW A WEEKEND AND DO SOME SHROOMS WITH A REALLY FUN GUY ALSO A GOOD CHOICE.
YES, THAT IS YET TO COME.
Jon: PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. BUT, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU. THINGS OBVIOUSLY GOING GREAT GUNS FOR YOU.
YEAH, EVERYTHING IS GREAT.
Jon: THE FILM IS GOOD.
DRAFT DAY. IT'S ACTUALLY, IT'S A REALLY SUPER FUN MOVIE.
Jon: IT LOOKS REALLY FUN. ALTHOUGH, OBVIOUSLY YOU SPEND TIME WITH LEARY. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE, I THINK -- YOU KNOW IN A CAREER YOU HOPE THAT EACH EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE IS BETTER THAN THE NEXT. YOU BEGAN BY SHARING TIME WITH STEPHEN COLBERT BACKSTAGE AND YOU END UP WITH LEARY AND I THINK THAT'S -- I DON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD TRAGIC BUT --
DENIS SAID THE NICEST THINGS ABOUT YOU. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU WERE THE KINDEST, THE SMARTEST, THE MOST -- THE MOST GENEROUS OF HEART. HE SAID HE ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO YOU AS A MENTOR THAT YOU ARE TO HIM. [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID THAT YOU ARE LIKE A BIG MUCH, MUCH OLDER BROTHER. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, DRAFT DAY, THE JENNIFER GARNER STARRING VEHICLE, IS A STARRING VEHICLE FOR JENNIFER GARNER. SHE IS, BY RIGHTS, THE BEST ACTOR IN IT AND HAS THE TOP BILLING IN IT.
ALONG WITH KEVIN COSTNER.
ALONG WITH KEVIN COSTNER. YOU CAN DISS DENIS LEARY. BUT KEVIN, C'MON HE'S KEVIN COSTNER.
Jon: HE'S KEVIN. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF HANDSOME THERE.
THERE IS A LOT OF HANDSOME THERE.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT, I ALWAYS IMAGINE KEVIN COSTNER LIKE WHEN HE IS NOT ON SET JUST SLIGHTLY OFFSET SITTING ON A HORSE SMOKING. FOR NO REASON. JUST INSIDE. AND YOU ARE LIKE WHY IS THAT GUY ON A HORSE INSIDE? BUT IT'S LIKE, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
THAT'S KINDA IT, ISN'T IT?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT REALLY WAS, HONESTLY? --
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW -- REALLY TRULY WHEN HE IS NOT SHOOTING, YOU KNOW, WITH A CAMERA, HE IS IN THE NEXT ROOM SOME OF HIS BAND MEMBERS CAME AND THEY WOULD BE THERE PLAYING. SINGING. HE'S SINGING ALL THE TIME. ALWAYS SINGING.
Jon: WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THAT STORY BETTER FOR MY TASTE IS IF IT WAS A MARCHING BAND. AND IT'S KEVIN COSTNER AND YOU WALK IN THERE AND HE'S JUST GOING. GONNA FLY NOW! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING BY.
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. Jon: IT'S MY PLEASURE. AND TELL YOUR FELLA I SAID HELLO. DRAFT DAY IN THE THEATERS ON FRIDAY. JENNIFER GARNER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
