HELLO.
Jon: ENJOY, SOAK IT IN. HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
I'M WELL, HOW ARE YOU?
Jon: FOR NEW YORKERS WHERE DID YOU GROW UP LOS ANGELES?
I GREW UP IN LOS ANGELES.
Jon: SO MARTY SCORSESE IS LIKE THE POPE OF
Jon: SO MARTY SCORSESE IS LIKE THE POPE OF NEW YORK, FILM WISE.
RIGHT.
Jon: I'M SO ANGRY AT YOU FOR BEING SO CLOSE TO THAT MAN. I'M NOT ALLOWED WITHIN HALF A MILE.
NO YOU ARE NOT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: WAS THAT AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE?
HE IS MY FAVORITE ARTIST OF ANY MEDIUM. FAVORITE FILMMAKER. FAVORITE ANYTHING. GOOD FELLAS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO MAKE MOVIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO EVEN GET TO MEET HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY EXISTENCE. I GOT TO PLAY OPPOSITE LEO IN A MOVIE DIRECTED BY HIM.
Jon: IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.
I PLAY AN UNHINGED DRUG ADDICT MANIACAL WALL STREET CRIMINAL.
Jon: DO THEY HAVE THOSE?
APPARENTLY NOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WORKED ON WALL STREET EVER WAS BY THE BOOK AND A GOOD PERSON ALL AROUND.
Jon: I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THIS.
I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THIS OUT AS WELL. I ASSUMED THEY WERE BOY SCOUTS WALKING AROUND THERE.
Jon: WHEN HE -- SO DOES HE APPROACH YOU FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. DO YOU HAVE TOP SEND IN A TAPE? DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO SOME UNDERGROUND LAIR? HOW DOES THIS OCCUR? HOW D
I DID A FILM CALLED MONEYBALL.
Jon: NICE WORK.
-- THANK YOU. I GOT NOMINATED FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD WHICH IS CRAZY WITHIN ITSELF. AFTER THAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES STARTING COMING MY WAY. MY AGENT CALLED ME AND SAID YOU ARE ON THE BOTTOM OF A LIST OF ACTORS THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED TO PLAY OPPOSITE LEONARDO DICAPRIO IN THE WOLF OF WALL STREET.  I BEGGED LEO. I SAID I KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS IN SOCIETY. I WANT TO BE A PART OF SHOWING THAT AND BRINGING THAT PERSON TO LIFE. A MONTH LATER I GOT TO MEET WITH MARTIN SCORSESE THEY SAID HE WANTS TO MEET AND TALK ABOUT THE FILM. I SAID CAN I AUDITION FOR HIM. LET ME SHOW HIM WHAT I WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF BEGGING ON MY HANDS AND KNEES. THEY SAID OKAY. I HADN'T BEEN ON AN AUDITION IN SIX YEARS. MY FIRST AUDITION BACK WAS MARTIN SCORSESE.
Jon: NICE!
I WAS TERRIFIED. HE SAID KID, HOW ARE YOU DOING? SIT DOWN AND WE'RE GOING TO READ THIS THING. I GET THERE I'M SO NERVOUS. I WANT TO DIE. [ LAUGHTER ] AND I SEE THIS LADDER UP THERE AND I FEEL THAT IT'S SO HOT THAT I CAN'T BREATHE OR ANYTHING. I REALIZE THE LADDER IS LEADING UP TO THE AIR CONDITIONING AND IT'S NOT WORKING. I AM DRIPPING SWEAT AND SAY I NEED TO GO TO THE RESTROOM. I'M LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR SAYING GET YOUR (bleep) TOGETHER. DON'T BLOW THIS. I GO BACK IN AND SAY THIS IS GOING TO SOUND SO INSANE BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER PLACE WE CAN DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO PASS OUT. THE CASTING DIRECTOR SAID IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.  WE DID THE SCENES A COUPLE TIMES. ONE IS THAT SCENE YOU JUST WATCHED. TWO MONTHS I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING EXCEPT YOU ARE STILL IN THE RUNNING BUT THEY ARE MEETING WITH THIS ACTOR WHO IS BETTER THAN YOU. I WAS AT DINNER AND MY PHONE RANG AND IT WAS LEONARDO DICAPRIO SAYING LET'S DO THIS.
Jon: YOU HAD ME NERVOUS FOR A SECOND. HERE IS WHAT IS CRAZY ABOUT THAT STORY. I'M SO WRAPPED UP IN THE STORY. I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. I KNOW HE IS IN IT. STILL WASN'T SURE HE WAS GOING TO GET THE PART. I GOT NERVOUS ABOUT THAT ALL GOOD THINGS. WOLF OF WALL STREET. THEATERS ON DECEMBER 25. JONAH HILL.
