Jon: WELCOME BACK. THIS PAST SUNDAY, MAY 5TH,  WE CELEBRATED THAT MOST  AMERICAN OF HOLIDAYS CINCO  DE MAYO. BUT NOT EVERYONE IN THIS  COUNTRY UNDERSTANDS ITS TRUE  MEANING. JESSICA WILLIAMS REPORTS.
CINCO DE MAYO, THE PARTY  OF PARTIES. I WANTED TO HIT UP AN  AUTHENTIC FIESTA THIS YEAR  SO I WENT DOWN TO DALLAS,  TEXAS, WHERE THOUSANDS OF LATINOS WERE TAKING THE  PARTY TO THE STREETS. HOW'S YOUR PARTY GOING.
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY A  PARTY FOR US.
ARE YOU KIDDING?
LOOK AT ALL THESE MOVES  I'M DOING.
WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR  IS IMMIGRATION REFORM.
HERE I AM WITH MY GIRLS  ON CINCO DE MAYO!
WE'RE HERE TO MARCH FOR  IMMIGRATION REFORM.
Reporter: SO 5,000 PEOPLE  CHOSE TO WASTE THEIR CINCO  DE MAYO BY MARCHING FOR MORE HUMANE IMMIGRATION LAWS? NAH-UH, NOT ON MY WATCH.
I HAVE A PERMIT BUT AFTER  THAT --
LET'S TALK ABOUT PARTY  STUFF LIKE WHAT IS THE  CRAZIEST PLACE YOU HAVE  BONKED SOMEBODY. MEAN IN AN OSCAR WEANER  MOBILE.
I DON'T HAVE ONE LIKE  THAT.
WHEN I WAS 13 MY FATHER  WAS DEPORTED. I WAS LIVING WITH WASN'T  LIVING WHERE MY MOTHER,  SEPARATED FOR 20 YEARS.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT  THAT MEANS, PARENTS AWAY,  YOU GOT TO GET WITH IT. TAKE THE-- OFF.
I WAS TRYING TO GET THE  PARTY STARTED BUT THE  NEGATIVITY WAS WEARING ME  DOWN.
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ARE  GETTING SEPARATED FROM THEIR  FAMILIES.
WORKING LONG HOURS,  OVERTIME WITHOUT BEING PAID.
FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS  IN AMERICA.
IT'S HARD FOR US TO GET  ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE.
THESE PEOPLE WERE BUMMING  ME OUT. WHAT'S WORSE, WHAT I THOUGHT  WAS THE BEER LINE TURNED OUT  TO BE FOR SOMETHING CALLED  BOTAR. CLEARLY THESE PEOPLE HAD A  LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE  AMERICAN HOLIDAY OF CINCO DE  MAYO. I TOOK A FEW OF THESE PARTY  POOPERS WITH ME TO SHOW THEM  THE TRUE MEANING OF THE DAY.
CINCO DE MAYO IS THE  SINGLE BEST EXCUSE TO GO OUT  AND DO UNLIMITED TEQUILA SHOTS ALL DAY LONG.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT MI  TALKING ABOUT.
CINCO DE MAYO IS A PARTY. NO POLITICS. ONCE IT GETS INTO POLITICO  STUFF IT IS NO FUN.
WE DON'T WANT TO GET NOT  POLITICO STUFF.
NO.
THERE IS WHAT CINCO DE  MAYO IS ALL ABOUT.
THEY HAD MUCH TO LEARN  ABOUT OUR TRADITION.
TRADITIONALLY ON CINCO DE  MAYO WE EAT STOCK ITOES  WHICH ARE SMALL TACOES.
SEE A THAT QUITO.
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT A THAT  QUITO IS.
MUSTACHE, SOMEBREROES.
I HATE CINCO DE MAYO. GRINGO CAN'T HANDLE THE  TEQUILA. JUST TIRED OF IT. I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
I EVEN FIGURED OUT A WAY  TO COMBINE OUR RITUALIZED  DRINKING WITH THEIR BIZARRE NEED TO CONSTANTLY CRUSADE  FOR BASIC RIGHTS.
MY FAMILY BEING SEPARATED,  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO  DESCRIBE IT BUT INHUMANE.
INHUMANE.
THAT'S ONE, EVERYBODY  DRINK.
ACROSS CULTURE SUCCESS. ONE OF THE ACTIVISTS EVEN  OFFERED TO BE A DESIGNATED  DRIVER.
OR I COULD TAKE FOUR IN  THE BACK.
MAYBE WE NEED EACH OTHER  AFTER ALL.
THEY DO THE JOBS WE DON'T  WANT TO DO. STAYING SONER AND BEING  POLITICALLY ENGAGED. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
