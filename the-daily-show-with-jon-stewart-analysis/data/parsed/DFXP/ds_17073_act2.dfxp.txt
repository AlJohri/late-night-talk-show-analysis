Jon: WELCOME BACK. WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE RELATIVE OFFENSE I HAVE BEENNESS OF RUSH LIMBAUGH'S  SANDRA FLUKE SLUT DIE TRIBE VERSUS BILL MAHER'S SARAH PALIN C-WORD SLAM. FOR MORE, WE'RE JOINED BY DAILY SHOW SENIOR WOMEN'S ISSUES CORRESPONDENT KRISTEN SCHAAL. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. ( APPLAUSE ) KRISTEN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS CONTROVERSY?
WELL, JON, FOR STARTERS I THINK WE'RE FOCUSING WAY TOO MUCH ON THE NAME-CALLING AND  THE PARTISAN BICKERING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN ALL AGREE ON ONE THING: WOMEN  ARE EITHER SLUTS OR (BEEP). RIGHT? DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU'RE ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT. OBVIOUSLY INDEPENDENTS WOULD USE BITCH. THEY'RE REBELS.
Jon: OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY THREE WORDS YOU COULD....
OH, RIGHT. I FORGOT WHORE. I'M SUCH A SILLY SLUT.
Jon: IF EVERYBODY USES DEROGATORY LANGUAGE ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, THEN HOW  DO WOMEN CHOOSE WHICH....
I LIKE TO LOOK PAST THE NAME CALLING TO WHAT I CALL THE POLICIES. IN STATE AFTER STATE IT SEEMS THE REPUBLICAN POLICIES SPEAK EVEN LOUDER THAN SOME OF THEIR  RADIAL JERKS. OH, SORRY. I SAID JERKS. THAT WAS SO SLUTTY OF ME TO SAY.
Jon: IT'S OKAY.
OKAY. LOOK AT TEXAS. THEY'VE CUT FUNDING FOR BREAST EXAMS AND PAP SMEARS.
Jon: YOU FEEL LIKE IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO GAIN FAVOR WITH WOMEN THEY NEED TO CHANGE  THEIR POLICIES.
NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M SAYING THEY SHOULD USE THE AMNESTY THEY THINK IS GRANTED TO COMEDIANS AND REFRAME THEIR  POLICIES AS COMEDY. THE MATERIAL IS THERE, OKAY. TRUST ME. THEY JUST NEED TO WORK ON THEIR DELIVERY.
Jon: SO YOU'RE... OH, YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE?
HERE WE GO. REPUBLICANS, WATCH AND LEARN.
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU... WHERE ARE YOU....
HEY! HOW IS EVERYONE DOING TONIGHT? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LET'S GET THIS MOTHER (BEEP)  GIGGLE COASTER ROLLING. SO I JUST FLEW IN FROM VIRGINIA AND BOY DOES MY VAGINA TIRED. FROM THE INVOLUNTARY ULTRASOUND, AM I RIGHT, LADIES? BY THE WAY, WHY DO THEY CALL IT A WAND? WHERE ARE WE, HOG WARTS, RIGHT? THE ONLY THING MAGICALLY DISAPPEARING WAS MY SENSE OF DIGNITY AND PRIVACY. BOOM! THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEE, JON, YOU SAY BOOM THAT MEANS THE PUNCH LINE HAS LANDED. WATCH AND LEARN, BUDDY. HERE'S A GOOD ONE. ANYBODY HERE FROM OKLAHOMA? ANYONE? NO. OKAY. NO FANS FROM OKLAHOMA ON THE DAILY SHOW. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FERTILIZED EGG, A CORPORATION, AND A WOMAN? ONE OF THEM IS NOT CONSIDERED A PERSON IN OKLAHOMA. BOOM! THANK YOU. ( APPLAUSE ) THANK YOU. IT'S THE WOMAN. YEAH. IT'S THE WOMAN. THE CORPORATION AND THE EGGS ARE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY IT'S FUNNY. TRUTH IN COMEDY. THIS (BEEP) COULD WRITE ITSELF. YOU GUYS LIKE IMPRESSIONS? HUH? ( APPLAUSE ) YOU DOVE DICE. ISN'T HE LIKE YOUR BROTHER OR SOMETHING?
Jon: NO.
HICKORY DICK ORY DOCK, WHAT IS ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT MY FETUS? YOU'RE MY DOCTOR FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. END OF STORY. I GOT A CIGARETTE ALL THE TIME. DICE. ( APPLAUSE ) KNOCK, KNOCK.
Jon: WHO'S THERE?
UNWANTED TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND.
Jon: UNWANTED....
THERE IT IS. THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
Jon: NO, I DON'T THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING, SIR?
Jon: I HOST THE SHOW YOU'RE ON.
WHOA, WHOA, WATCH THE ATTITUDE, OKAY. I DON'T COME OVER TO WHERE YOU WORK AND KNOCK THE PENIS JOKES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
Jon: THIS IS WHERE I WORK.
OH. I REALLY LIKE IT HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
Jon: THANK YOU, KRISTEN. KRISTEN SCHAAL, EVERYBODY. (
