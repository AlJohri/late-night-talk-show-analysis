Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW, THIS IS JON  STEWART. BIG SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT TONY  NOMINEE NATHAN LANE WILL BE  JOINING US NOW ON BROADWAY  IN A PHENOMENAL PLAY, "THE NANCE"  IT IS THE STORY OF CBS  SPORTSCASTER JIM NANCE AND  IT IS--   (LAUGHTER)  THAT JUST KILLED IN THE PRESS BOX AT PATRIOT STADIUM  BUT OTHER THAN THAT-- WE  BEGIN TONIGHT IN WASHINGTON. WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA FINDS  HIMSELF IN A VERITABLE SLUM  OF SCANDALS WHERE WITH THE IRS TARGETING POLITICAL O  POINTS. THE THE STATE DEPARTMENT  MANIPULATING POINT, THE POST  OFFICE SENDING PORNOGRAPHY TO PEOPLE'S HOMES ADDRESSED  TO SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T EVEN  ORDER IT. WHY WOULD I ORDER  PORNOGRAPHY, I MEANS  THAT'S-- THE LAST ONE IS  PROBABLY NOT AN ADMINISTRATION SCANDAL, I  JUST FIND IT FRUSTRATING. ALL RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT WAS FORTUNATE  YESTERDAY THAT WHEN HE  APPEARED BEFORE THE PRESS,  HE WAS KPD BY BRITISH PRIME MINISTER CAMERON. AND A QUESTION LIMIT OF ONE. TOTAL FROM THE ENTIRE  AMERICAN PRESS CORP. GIVE IT  YOUR BEST SHOT, GUYS.
WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARN  THAT THE IRS WAS TARGETING  CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL GROUPS? DO YOU FEEL THAT THE IRS  BETRAYED THE PUBLIC A TRUST  AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE  REPERCUSSIONS FOR THESE ACTIONS SHOULD BE?
Jon: TECHNICALLY THAT WAS  THREE QUESTIONS. BUT OBVIOUSLY ONE GENERAL  MILL LIKE TOOTHPASTE THAT  INCLUDES FLUORIDE AND WHITENER, COMES OUT OF THE SAME TUBE  BUT PROVIDES TRIPLE  PROTECTION. AQUAFRESH. IT'S LIKE BRUSHING YOUR  TEETH WITH A COLOURFUL  ZEBRA. (LAUGHTER)  ANYWAY, GREAT JOB. WE'RE ON BASIC CABLE. WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY. GREAT JOB BY THAT INTREPID  REPORTER GETTING AN IRS  THREE-FER FOR THE ONE  QUESTION.
AND ON BENGHAZI-- .
Jon: HOLY [BLEEP] SOMEBODY JUST ADDED TARTAR  CONTROL! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: TARTAR CONTROL,  BECAUSE APPARENTLY THIS ONE  DOESN'T CONTROL TARTAR. LET'S TARTAR RUN ALL OVER  YOUR MOUTH.
FROM I WAS ALWAYS TOLD  THE WHOLE POINT OF  TOOTHPASTE WAS TO CONTROL  TARTAR BUT IN THE WORLD OF AQUAFRESH IT IS A BON IS  STRIPE. (LAUGHTER)  MY IMPRESSION OF THE  AQUAFRESH MARKETING  DEPARTMENT, SEND STEWART A  CARTON OF AQUAFRESH-- WAIT WAIT-- ANYWAY. THE POINT IS THE WHITE HOUSE  WAS NOT QUITE SO SUCCESSFUL  IN RESTRICTING THE FREEDOM OF THIS PARTICULAR PRESS. LET'S START WITH THE FIRST  QUERY, MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN  DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE IRS TARGETING CONSERVATIVE  GROUPS?
I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT IT  FROM THE SAME NEWS REPORTS  THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE LEARNED ABOUT THIS. I THINK IT WAS ON FRIDAY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOTICE HE THOUGHT TO  RUN THAT UP THE FLAG POLE  LET'S SAY THE HEAD OF THE IRS WHO HAS KNOWN ABOUT IT  AN YEAR. THE FAVORITE PART WAS I  THINK IT WAS-- ON FRIDAY, I  THINK. (LAUGHTER)  WHAT WAS THAT DAY THAT I  FOUND OUT THAT THE IRS MAY  BE USING ITS POWER FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES LET'S SEE  THAT WAS-- WELL, OH, THE  BEER SUMMIT WAS ON WEDNESDAY AND THEN THURSDAY WAS  LISTENING TO AMERICAN PHONE  CALLS AND RANDOMLY FIRING  DRONE MISSILES WHERE. WAS I WHEN I HEARD THE IRS  NEWS I WAS AT THE MOSQUE  PRAYING, SO YES, FRIDAY, I  THINK IT WAS FRIDAY. (APPLAUSE)  BUT I GUESS I CAN BUY THAT  NOBODY IN THE ADMINISTRATION  THOUGHT TO MENTION THIS ISSUE TO THE PRESIDENT,  SLIGHT OVERSIGHT IT NEVER  HAPPENED BEFORE.
I HEARD ON THE NEWS ABOUT  THIS STORY THAT FAST AND  FURIOUS RZ IT HAPPENED ONE OTHER TIME WITH THE FAST AND  FURIOUS, FAILED GUN TRACKING  OPERATION WHERE SOMEBODY ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BRING DK --  INTO MEXICO TO SEE WHERE  THEY ENDED UP WHILE  FORGETTING TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY ENDED UP.
IT WAS SOMETHING WE FOUND  OUT ABOUT A LONG WITH ALL OF  YOU RZ AND THAT OTHER TIME WHEN AIR FORCE ONE DID AN  UNANNOUNCED POST 9/11 LOWER  MANHATTAN STATUE OF LIBERTY FLY OVER FOR THIS SWEET OT  OWE-- PHOTO OP THAT IN NO  WAY COULD HAVE BEEN PHOTO  SHOPPED SAVE LOWER MANHATTANITES TRAUMA RELATED  DIARRHEA.
WE DON'T HAVE ANY  INDEPENDENT KNOWLEDGE OF  THAT. HE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT WITH  THE NEWS REPORTS YESTERDAY  ON THE ROAD RZ AND  YESTERDAY'S NEWS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD  SEEN TWO MONTHS OF PHONE  RECORDS FROM AP REPORTERS. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF  PRESIDENT OBAMA LEARNED  OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD BEEN  KILLED WHEN HE SAW HIMSELF ANNOUNCING IT ON TELEVISION. (APPLAUSE)  OH, WOW, WE DID THAT. WHY DOESN'T ANYONE TELL ME  THESE THINGS. THE POINT S I THINK THE  WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO  START READING THEIR E-MAILS  AND HAVING MEETINGS NOW. (LAUGHTER)  BUT I TELL YOU WHO THE REAL  VICTIM OF THIS IS. DAVID CAMERON. CAMERON JUST HAD TO SORT OF  STAND THERE LOOKING DOWN FOR  THE GRILLING. HE'S LIKE A KID WHO GOT  INVITED OVER TO A FRIEND'S  HOUSE FOR DINNER ON THE  NIGHT HIS FRIEND'S PARENTS FILED FOR DIVORCE. (LAUGHTER)  (LAUGHTER)  YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT, I  THINK I'LL TAKE MY PLATE AND  EAT OUTSIDE IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. FOR MORE ON PRIME MINISTER  CAMERON'S WHITE HOUSE VISIT  WE GO TO JOHN OLIVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. JOHN! HOW ARE YOU SIR? (APPLAUSE)  WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THIS  JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE.
JON, I THINK IT'S PRETTY  CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED HERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA PICKED THE  WRONG BRIT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A  DISTRACTION FOR THE PRESS,  YOU HAVE GOT TO GO WITH THIS  GUY. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: YEAH.
IS THAT ONE DIRECTION?
NO, IT'S NOT ONE  DIRECTION, JON. PRINCE HARRY IS IN TOWN, JON,  RIGHT NOW, THAT'S THE BRIT  THAT YOU WANT. NOT THE PASTEY MP FROM WEST  OXFORDSHARE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE  DASHING SOLDIER PRINCE WHO  MAKES PEOPLE REACT TO HIM  LIKE THIS.
FRANKLY, I FOUND HIM TO  BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG  MAN. (LAUGHTER)  YOU JUST HEARD HIM RIGHT  THERE, JON, PRINCE HARRY  JUST GAVE THAT MAN HIS FIRST ERECTION SINCE 1983. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S A FACT SO WITH  THAT IN MIND, JUST IMAGINE  WHAT YOU COULD DO TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS. I WOULD ASK YOU A LOT MORE  THAN SAY SOMEONE WHO'S IS  DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THESE OLD WAX STATUES. JON, THE FACT THAT THE  PRESIDENT WAS SITTING ON  THIS ROYAL ASSET ALL WEEK  AND FAILED TO USE IT MAY BE THE MOST DAMNING SIGN OF HIS  COMPETENT SO FAR.
Jon: I UNDER STARCH. I ACTUALLY SAW THE PRINCE  LAY A WREATH AT ARTICLETON  CEMETERY AND I WOULD SAY T WAS VERY MOVING.
I SAW IT TOO, I AGREE  WITH YOU. AND PRINCE HARRY WAS JUST  WARMING UP. HE THEN WENT ON TO WOUNDED  WARRIORS AND THREW AN  AMERICAN FOOTBALL ADOREABLY  BADLY.
Jon: THORT.
IN THE WAY TO MANAGE TO  INDICATE BOTH ATHLETICISM  AND ALSO A CHARMING LACK OF SKILL AT ANY SPORT NOT  PLAYED WHILE MOUNTED ON A  HORSE. AND THEN, JON, HE GAVE HIS  EYE TO A BABY, JON.
Jon: WOW.
TO A BABY!
Jon: WOW.
A BABY WHO HAD ALREADY  HAD TWO EYES! THAT IS WHO YOU WANT AS YOUR  DISTRACTION WING MAN, JON,  WHEN SOME REPORTER ASKS YOU A 17 PART QUESTION THAT  ESSENTIALLY BOILS DOWN TO  WHY CAN'T YOU BE A BETTER  PRESIDENT.
Jon: I MEAN I DON'T KNOW,  JOHN, I DON'T KNOWN, I DON'T  EVEN THINK MARRY COULD PROTECT THE PRESIDENT WITH  ALL THIS GOING ON. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PRESS  STARTS ASK ABOUT THE  BENGHAZI ARB REPORT.
YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY  RIGHT, JOHN.
Jon: I'M SAYING.
SORRY, I WAS-- I WAS JUST  THINKING ABOUT THAT  INTERVIEW THE PRINCE HARRY CUT SHORT IN AFGHANISTAN  WHEN HE SUDDENLY HAD TO GO  FLY AN APACHE HELICOPTER AND SHOOT BAD GUYS, JON.
Jon: CAN WE WATCH IT  AGAIN.
IS THERE ANY WAY TO WATCH  IT AGAIN.
OF COURSE WE CAN. ROLL IT AGAIN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  (LAUGHTER)
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU  SOMETHING, WE COULD REALLY  USE SOMEONE LIKE HARRY. WE COULD REALLY USE SOMEONE  LIKE HARRY.
WHY DO YOU THINK WE STILL  HAVE THE ROYAL FAMILY, JON. THEY SERVE ABSOLUTELY NO  PURPOSE WHATSOEVER EXCEPT AS  A PLEASANT DISTRACTION. PLEASE UNDERSTAND, BRITAIN  IS MISERABLE, JON. WE'RE IN A DOUBLE DIP  RECESSION WITH A PRIME  MINISTER THAT ABSOLUTELY  NOBODY LIKES. THE ONLY THING THAT GETS US  THROUGH THE DAY ARE THE  COMING AND GOINGS OF A  GENETICALLY A TEN WAITED ON SOL ESENCE AND THEIR  COLLECTION OF TREMENDOUSLY  SILLY [BLEEP] HATS!
Jon: WORDS TO LIVE BY,  THANK YOU, JOHN, JOHN OLVER,  EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT
