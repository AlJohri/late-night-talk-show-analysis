Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A  BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF THE HARRY  POTTER SERIES OF BOOKS. HER NEW NOVEL IS CALLED THE  CASUAL VACANCY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  ONCE AGAIN J.K. ROWLING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Jon: FIRST, YOU ARE SO  ELECTRIC. YOU JUST BLEW UP HALF OF OUR  STUDIO GRID. THE BOOK IS CALLED THE CASUAL  VACANCY. LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU ON  SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS ONE OF  THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS FOR AN  ARTIST AND AUTHOR TO DO AND ACCOMPLISH IS TO CREATE  SOMETHING OF GREAT SUCCESS AND  THEN LET IT BE AND CREATE  SOMETHING ELSE AND PUT IT OUT BOLDLY
THANK YOU  Jon: THAT IS NOT AN EASY  THINGED TO DO. I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR IT.
THANK YOU. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE A  LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS IS VERY  BRAVE. BUT I'M NOT SURE IT FELT VERY  BRAVE. THE BRAVE THING HONESTLY WAS  WORKING ON SOMETHING SEVEN YEARS  WITH NO HOPE OF GETTING IT  PUBLISHED. I LOOK BACK AT THOSE DAYS AND  THINK, WELL, I WAS BRAVE THEN  BECAUSE I SHOWED A LOT OF SELF  BELIEF REALLY
Jon: ABSOLUTELY. WHAT WAS IT IN YOURSELF BELIEF  THAT ALLOWED YOU TO SUSTAIN  THAT?
GOD ONLY KNOWS BECAUSE REALLY  I LOOK BACK AND I THINK, YOU  KNOW, OBVIOUSLY IT WAS HOURS,  MONTHS, YEARS LITERALLY. I REALLY BELIEVED IN THE STORY.
Jon: I'M GOING TO MAKE A  CONNECTION HERE ON THIS BOOK,  THE CASUAL VACANCY. THERE IS A SOCIAL ASPECT TO THIS  BOOK THAT I THINK IS INFORMED BY  THOSE EARLY YEARS OF STRUGGLE. IT FEELS LIKE THE THREAD OF  WHICH GOES THROUGH THIS  NARRATIVE
DEFINITELY. IT'S NOT AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OR A  MEMOIR. BUT I COULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN THIS  BOOK IF I HADN'T HAD A FEW YEARS  WHERE I HAD BEEN REALLY AS POOR  AS IT'S POSSIBLE TO GO IN THE U.K. WITHOUT BEING HOMELESS. I MEAN I HAD FRIENDS WHO HELPED  ME BUT NO FRIENDS OR FAMILY WHO  WERE IN A POSITION TO GIVE ME A  HOUSE. WE WERE ON WELFARE IS WHAT YOU  WOULD CALL WELFARE. I WOULD CALL IT BENEFITS FOR A  COUPLE YEARS
Jon: IN THIS COUNTRY, WE CALL  IT TO MAKE IT AS DIMINISHING AS  POSSIBLE. WE DON'T CALL IT BENEFITS. WE LIKE YOU TO FEEL AS BAD AS  YOU CAN
I HAVE TO SAY THAT EXISTS IN  MY COUNTRY ALSO.
Jon: IT DOES  AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS LIVING  ON BENEFITS, PEOPLE ON BENEFITS  WERE BEING PRETTY SEVERELY...
Jon: AREN'T YOU A PERFECT  EXAMPLE OF A GOOD INVESTMENT  FROM THE GOVERNMENT? HAS THE GOVERNMENT EVER GOTTEN  MORE BACK FROM AN INVESTMENT  THAN FROM YOU? (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I WOULD THINK, YES. ABSOLUTELY. FOR WHICH I WAS GRATEFUL AND  STILL AM. I RECEIVED A SUBSIST REALLY FROM  THE GOVERNMENT FOR A RELATIVELY  SHORT PERIOD IN MY LIFE. I PAY A LOT OF TAX. I FEEL ONE OF THE REASONS I STAY  AND PAY, WHY I'M NOT BASED IN  MONACO, IS I FEEL I OWE... I  TRULY DO FEEL THAT. I THINK MY COUNTRY HELPED ME. THERE ARE PLACES IN THE WORLD  WHERE I WOULD HAVE STARVED
Jon: TELL ME AGAIN THE NAME  OF THAT COUNTRY...
MONOCO IS NICE THIS TIME OF  YEAR. BELIZE IS A GOOD ONE
Jon: IT'S VERY INTERESTING  BECAUSE IN THIS, FIRST OF ALL,  IT IS FOR AMERICANS THEY WOULD  PROBABLY UNDERSTAND THERE'S A DAVID LYNCH LIKE QUALITY TO  THIS. IT'S SORT OF VERY SUBURBAN...
IT'S PARTLY VERY SUBURBAN,  YES.
Jon: BUT THE UNDERPINNINGS OF  THE TOWN ARE SOMEWHAT MORE  DARKLY...
I WOULD AGREE, YES. IT'S A SMALL ENGLISH TOWN. VERY PRETTY. IT'S NOT BASED ON A REAL PLACE. BUT IT IS THE KIND OF PLACE THAT  I KNOW WELL. I GREW UP IN A TOWN THAT IS IS  NOT GEOGRAPHICALLY EXACTLY WHERE  THIS TOWN IS BUT IT'S NOT  DISSIMILAR IN FEELING. YOU'VE TO TRANSLATE FOR ME. IT IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL A  COUNCIL ESTATE
Jon: WE WOULD CALL THAT A  HOUSE WITH AN ELEVATOR FOR YOUR  CAR.
SO THE TOWN REALLY DOESN'T  WANT RESPONSIBILITY FOR...
Jon: OH,' PROJECT. THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE OF LESS  MEANS WOULD LIVE
NOW WE UNDERSTAND  Jon: WE WOULD CALL IT THE  PROJECTS
IT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF  THE PROJECTS, RIGHT. AND THE TOWN HAS POLITICAL  JURISDICTION OVER THIS AREA AND  REALLY DOESN'T WANT IT. THEY SEE THEM AS A DRAIN AND SO  ON AND SO FORTH. THAT IS THE STARTING POINT OF  THE NOVEL.
Jon: IF I MAY AND I JUST WANT  TO GIVE IT AWAY VERY QUICKLY, IT  ENDS...
DUMBLEDORF COMES BACK. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE WITH  J.K. ROWLING. CASUAL VACANCY IS ON THE BOOK  SHELVES NOW. J.K. ROWLING. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
