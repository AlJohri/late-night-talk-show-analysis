SECOND CITY OVER HERE.
SECOND CITY I WAS IN AMSTERDAM DOING BOOM CHICAGO WHICH YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD OF.
Jon: I HAVE HEARD OF AMSTERDAM. BUT BOOM CHICAGO, WHAT IS THAT?
IT WAS A BLUR. IT IS A CHICAGO STYLE COMEDY THEATRE IN AMSTERDAM DEEP DISH COMEDY. YUP. I WAS TOLD THAT HERE YOU GUYS JUST DO COMEDY.
Jon: WE JUST CALL IT COMEDY. HOW DID-- SO DO YOU MEET AT MAD TV? HOW DID IT COME ABOUT WE MET IN CHICAGO, SECOND CITY. YEAH, HIS GROUP FROM AMSTERDAM CAME TO CHICAGO. AND THEY WERE PERFORMING THERE AND THAT'S WHERE WE MET. ONE OF THE WRITERS ON OUR SHOW INTRODUCED US. AND THEN IT WAS JUST LIKE A NERD OUT SESSION.
Jon: WAS IT REALLY.
IMMEDIATELY YOU THOUGHT OH, I LIKE THIS GUY. I CAN WORK WITH THIS GUY.
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE MALE CRUSH.
UH-HUH.
WE WENT TO A DINER, JUST THREE AND A HALF HOURS.
TALKING ABOUT MONTY PYTHON AND OTHER FUNNY THINGS. BUT IT WAS GREAT. AND THEN SERENDIPITOUSLY ENDED UP ON MAD TV TOGETHER.
Jon: THAT WASN'T, I THOUGHT THAT IS MAYBE WHERE YOU --
NO, WE MET BEFORE THAT.
Jon: AND IS THAT WHERE THE PLANS WERE HATCHED BECAUSE THE SKETCH, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE SHOW IS IT'S ALWAYS SURPRISING. THERE'S ALWAYS, YOU SET UP A PREMISE BUT YOU TAKE IT IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. IT'S SO WELL DONE.
THANKS.
Jon: YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.
WE REALLY ARE. WE HAVE A GREAT STAFF.
Jon: I HEARD YOUR STAFF IS NO GOOD.
THE STAFF IS NOT GOOD.
Jon: I HEARD THE SHOW IS GOOD BUT THE STAFF IS VERY, VERY BAD, VERY BAD.
DRAIN ON THE RESOURCES.
THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF DOING A SKETCH SHOW IS YOU GET TO DO DIFFERENT, IT'S A HOLO DECK TO BE PERFECTLY NERDY.
Jon: AT WHAT POINT IN THE DINER CONVERSATION DO YOU THROW OUT THE WORD HOLODECK?
TWO HOURS IN, I DON'T WANT TO THROW IT OUT TOO EARLY THIS GUY MIGHT LEAVE.
YOU HAVE TO GAUGE SOMEONE.
ARE THEY READY FOR A STRAIGHT STAR TREK REFERENCE.
I THINK WAS LESS THAN 90 MINUTES IN, BEFORE THAT REFERENCE CAME I BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED. IT WAS LIKE NEXT GENERATION? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: IS IT PROBING YOU.
UH-HUH.
Jon: SO EVER ONE OF THESE, LIKE STAR WARS, STAR TREK, THAT WAS ALREADY SETTLED THAT IT WOULD BE STAR TREK.
DO WE EVEN KNOW, I MEAN WE'RE CLEARLY --
SEE THAT'S THE  WAY-- THAT'S-- .
Jon: AND THUS KEY AND PEELE BROKE UP. THE END CAME QUICKLY.
RIGHT HERE.
Jon: STAR WARS TREK.
WE HAVE A STAR WARS SCENE THIS YEAR. I JUST SAID IT. KANDO LORISSIAN.
Jon: YOU SAY YOU LIKE THE TWIST.
WE HAVE A LANDO CALRISSIAN SCENE THIS YEAR.
Jon: YOU DO A HILARIOUS PRESIDENT ANGER TRANSLATOR. HAS THE PRESIDENT, DO YOU EVER HEAR FROM THEM, THE PRESIDENT GO UP AND GO GENTLEMEN, I'M NOT THAT ANGRY. IS THERE ANYTHING --

Jon: I WILL BE LIKE THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.
