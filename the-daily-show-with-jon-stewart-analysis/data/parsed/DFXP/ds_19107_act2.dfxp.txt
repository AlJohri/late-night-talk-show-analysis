WELCOME BACK. LAST WEEK OUR OWN JASON JONES TRAVELED TO INDIA TO REPORT ON THEIR JUST ADORABLE LARGEST DEMOCRACY ON EARTH. TONIGHT IN PART 2 OF HIS SERIES JASON LEARNS HOW INDIA HANDLES THE ELECTIONS THEMSELVES. AS I TRAVEL THROUGH INDIA I WAS STRUCK BY THIS FESTIVAL OF DEMOCRACY BUT IF THIS IS THEIR IDEA OF A MORNING COMMUTE THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD POSSIBLY ENGINEER ELECTIONS THAT RIVAL OURS. I SAT WITH THE FORMER HEAD OF INDIA'S POWERFUL ELECTION COMMISSION TO SEE HOW THIS ADORABLE DEMOCRACY HANDLES MODERN POLITICS.
WE IN INDIA HAVE SURELY THE BIGGEST DEMOCRACY ON THE PLANET. AND WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE THE GREATEST.
I DON'T WANT TO BAG BUT A COUPLE OF OUR STATES HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH ELECTRONIC VOTING. WE'RE KIND OF PIONEERS WHEN IT COMES TO THAT.
DO YOU WE HAVE 100% ELECTRONIC VOTING.
100 PERCENT.
100 PERCENT.
OKAY, FINE, BUT IN AMERICA WE HAVE A VARIETY OF WAYS TO KEEP VOTER TURNOUT LOW SO THAT OUR DEMOCRACY DOESN'T BECOME TOO REPRESENTATIVE. HOW DOES INDIA TAMP DOWN THEIR LESS DESIRED VOTERS.
WHO ARE YOUR DISENFRANCHISED VOTERS?
OH UH, OH, ACTUALLY, NOBODY.
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE  WHO-- WHAT ABOUT THE LEPERS IS WHAT I AM SAYING?
OH, THEY, THEY VOTE.
WHAT?
THEY VOTE.
I WAS JUST MAKING A JOKE. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE LEPERS HERE.
OF COURSE, EVERY VOTE COUNTS AND EVERY VOTE IS EQUAL.
YEAH, RIGHT, I OBTAINED THIS ACTUAL TRAINING VIDEO FROM THE ELECTION COMMISSION THAT SHOWS THEY DON'T REALLY DO THAT MUCH TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEPER VOTE BECAUSE IN INDIA THEY MARK YOUR FINGER AFTER YOU VOTE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LEFT INDEX FINGER. OH, YOU GO TO THE NEXT ONE?  OK, WELL WHAT IF YOU HAVE NO FINGERS? OH, YOU MARK THE HAND.  NO ARM? HOLY [BLEEP] THEY MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU. BUT IF THEY LET LEPERS VOTE WHAT GROUP DO THEY PREVENT FROM VOTING?
EVERYONE, RICH, POOR, URBAN, RURAL, LITERATE, ILLITERATE, EVERYONE, HOMELESS, THEY'RE ALL VOTERS.
YOU LET YOUR ILLITERATE VOTE?
OF COURSE. SOME OF THE ILLITERATES ARE THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC VOTERS. SO, THAT'S WHY FOR THEM WE HAVE SYMBOLS.
YOU JUST PICK EITHER THE KITE OR THE COFFEE CUP.
WHAT IS THIS ONE HERE? THIS LOOKS LIKE TWO PENISES.
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW. IT IS NOT VERY CLEAR.
NO, NO. IT'S VERY CLEAR IT LOOKS LIKE TWO [BLEEP] YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT HAS TO CARRY THE LAST PERSON WITH YOU.
AND HE LITERALLY MEANS THE LAST PERSON.
WE HAVE A POLLING STATION FOR A SINGLE VOTER IN THE FOREST OF GUJARAT.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN INCREDIBLE WASTE OF RESOURCES.
THAT IS A VERY OFFENSIVE STATEMENT.
BUT IT WAS TRUE, EVERYWHERE I WENT BY BOAT, OX CART, FARM EQUIPMENT OR THE PATEL FAMILY STATION WAGON THERE WAS A POLLING STATION. LITERALLY ONE STATION EVERY TWO KILOMETERS ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND THEY WERE SURPRISINGLY COMFORTABLE.
I LOVE THE SPREAD YOU PUT OUT FOR THE MEDIA, THAT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE. THESE CHIPS ARE GREAT.
MAYBE NOT FOR MEDIA, IT IS FOR OUR VOTERS.
THIS STUFF'S FOR THE VOTERS?
YES.
AND AMAZINGLY THE VOTERS ACTUALLY LIKED IT.
PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK THEIR VOTE COUNTS HERE?
WE BELIEVE OUR VOTES TRULY COUNT. AND WE WILL USE THEM TO BRING CHANGES TO THE RULING CONGRESS PARTY.
SURELY THE RULING CONGRESS PARTY MUST BE WORRIED ABOUT ALL THIS DEMOCRACY. I SAT DOWN WITH ONE OF THEIR TOP MEMBERS.
WE PREFER A SYSTEM IN INDIA WHERE IT'S ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES THAT DECIDE THAT.
THERE ARE THINGS YOU COULD DO TO PREVENT YOURSELF FROM LOSING.
AH, YOU MEAN BY ENSURING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T REGISTER TO VOTE?
EXACTLY.
WE DON'T DO THAT IN INDIA.
EVEN IF IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE.
WELL, I THINK IT WILL BE REVEALED BY THE VOTERS ON THE 16th OF MAY.
AND REVEALED IT WAS. THEY GOT THEIR ASSES KICKED WHEN 67% OF INDIAN VOTERS SHOWED UP AT THE POLLS. A NUMBER WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE THE ELECTION OF 1900.
HOW CAN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU AND SOUNDS LIKE YOU BE SUCH A [BLEEP] POLITICIAN.
I GUESS.
FINE, MAYBE THEIR DEMOCRACY WAS MORE VIBRANT THAN OURS. BUT COMING UP NEXT TIME WE'LL SEE THERE IS NO WAY THEIR 24 HOUR NEWS CAN LIVE UP TO --
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
JASON JONES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
