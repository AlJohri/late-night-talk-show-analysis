FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON  STEWART. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE  DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST JOURNALIST MARTHA  RADDATZ WILL BE HERE, MODERATOR  AND THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. A VERY ROUGH WEEKEND IN THE  TRI-STATE AREA. I'M SURE BY NOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN  PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE. HERE'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT  TO LOOK AT. THESE ARE MARATHON RUNNERS WHO  CHANNELED THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT  IN THE CANCELLATION OF THE MARATHON INTO VOLUNTEERING TO  HELP STORM CLEAN-UP. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   IT WAS VERY, VERY MOVING. IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU NOT THAT  ANNOYED BY MARATHON RUNNERS. NOT QUITE. OBVIOUSLY ALL DONATIONS STILL  GREATLY APPRECIATED. THE SANDY RELIEF FUND DOT-ORG. YOUR I-TUNES DOT-COM SLASH RED  CROSS. YOU HAVE YOUR UNITED WAY NYC  DOT-ORGAN THE SALVATION ARMY USA  DOT-ORG. WE'LL GIVE YOU THE WEBSITES FOR  THE GIANT NOR'EASTER COMING ON  WEDNESDAY. SOMEHOW WE HAVE ANNOYED GOD. WE'LL BEGIN TONIGHT AN HOUR AWAY  FROM ELECTION DAY. SHOULD ALREADY BE ELECTION DAY  BUT OF COURSE SATURDAY NIGHT  THEY ADDED ANOTHER [BLEEP] HOUR SO WE COULD STRETCH THIS THING  OUT. DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME IS TAKEN  AWAY. THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER HOUR SO THE  ELECTION TAKES LONGER. STARTING TO WONDER IF WE'RE EVER  GOING TO GET TO THE ELECTION OR  IF THEY'LL KEEP ADDING HOURS THE CLOSER WE GET LIKE XENO'S  ELECTORAL PARADOX. YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP.
THE CANDIDATES ARE  CRISS-CROSSING THESE BATTLE  GROUND STATES
QUITE A VIRGINIA BEACH WE  WELCOME
17,000  HELLO BOLDER  25,000 PEOPLE  QUITE A WELCOME  30-35,000  HELLO VIRGINIA! JOE BIDEN HAD 090 IN  COLORADO.
Jon: 900. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HIGH FOR  BIDEN, BUT TO BE FAIR THEY WERE  GIVING OUT FOOD AND BALLOONS. THE CANDIDATES ARE TAKING A  CHANCE TO MAKE FINAL ARGUMENT TO  AMERICA'S VOTERS
MITT ROMNEY... CROWD: BOO! DON'T BOO. VOTE. VOTE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   VOTING IS THE BEST REVENGE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ASKED HIS  SUPPORTERS TO VOTE FOR REVENGE.
CROWD: BOO! INSTEAD I ASK THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR LOVE OF  COUNTRY. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: I WANT THIS OVER! I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT  COMMENT OR MAYBE THIS IS THE  MILK I DRANK FROM A BODEGO THAT LOST POWER DURING THE BLACKOUT  BUT I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH  A LITTLE BIT. IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN  REALLY VOTE FOR REVENGE OR LOVE  OF COUNTRY, THEY'D BE KICKING BOTH YOUR ASSES IN THE POLLS. FOR MORE ON THE CAMPAIGN CLOSING  HOURS LET'S GO TO JESSICA  WILLIAMS AND AASIF MANDVI. THEY ARE WITH THE CANDIDATES  RIGHT NOW. JESSICA, YOU'RE AT OBAMA'S FINAL  RALLY IN DES MOINES
THE MOOD HERE IS POSITIVELY  ELECTRIC. J-Z IS KILLING IT. AND SINCE THIS IS IOWA, THEY  THINK HE'S ACTUALLY TALKING  ABOUT CHEESE. WHICH THEY REALLY LIKE SO IT'S A  VERY POSITIVE MESSAGE.
Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AASIF MANDVI YOU'RE WITH THE  ROMNEY CAMPAIGN IN MANCHESTER  NEW HAMPSHIRE
THAT'S RIGHT, JON. DIFFERENT FEELING HERE. ROMNEY IS TALKING ABOUT THE  CONSEQUENCES OF RE-ELECTING  OBAMA: HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, SLOW  GROWTH. SOMETHING WILL RISE FROM THE SEA  AND DESTROY THE CITY. STANDARD SPEECH
Jon: WHAT IS THAT IN THE  BACKGROUND?
YOU HEAR THAT TOO. BECAUSE NOBODY IS PLAYING IT. THERE IS NO DJ, NOTHING. THERE IS NO SOUND SYSTEM. IT'S REALLY KIND OF EERIE
Jon: HAVE YOU SEEN THE  HEADLINER YET?
NO. SPRINGSTEEN DOESN'T GO ON FOR  ANOTHER HOUR. DAVE MATTHEWS WAS HERE. KATIE PERRY ROCKED IT.
Jon: AASIF MANDVI, WHAT IS IT  LIKE WHERE YOU ARE?
A MEATLOAF SIGHTING A COUPLE  OF DAYS AGO. ♪ FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA ♪♪
SO I THINK HE'S NOT COMING  BACK UNTIL HE'S NO LONGER IN  HEAT.
Jon: BOTH CANDIDATES REALLY  LOOK PRETTY EXHAUSTED AT THIS  POINT
TRY BROKEN. TWO YEARS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL  WILL DO THAT TO YOU
TRY SEVEN YEARS. WHEN ROMNEY STARTED RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT WHO HAD THE NUMBER ONE  RECORD? AND THE GUY STILL WON'T TRY  COFFEE.
YES, JON. NO MATTER WHO WINS TOMORROW'S  ELECTION, ONE THING IS SURE
THAT PERSON WILL BE A SAD,  EMPTY 'EM BITTERED HUSK OF A  MAN. GOD BLESS AMERICA.
THANK YOU, BOTH. JESSICA AND AASIF MANDVI WITH  THE CAMPAIGN. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   IT'S NOT JUST THE CANDIDATES  FEELING THE CLOCK WINDING DOWN. TV PUNDITS ARE SCRAMBLING TO GET  THEIR FINAL PREDICTIONS IN  BEFORE TUESDAY
I THINK MITT ROMNEY WILL WIN  OBAMA COULD WIN BIG  THIS WILL BE A SQUEAKER E PRESIDENT IS LIKELY TO  WIN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL EKE IT  OUT BARELY
A SIZABLE ROMNEY VICTORY  277-303  NAIL BITER  MINNESOTA TO GO FOR ROMNEY OBAMA WINS  ROMNEY BY 3%  IT'S TOO CLOSE TO CALL. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CALL
Jon: IMPOSSIBLE? [BLEEP] WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE  DOING THERE? JUST OPEN YOUR MOUTH. LOOK AT THIS GUY. HERE'S NEWT GINGRICH. REMEMBER HIM FROM THE PRIMARIES?
THE ODDS ARE VERY HIGH I'M  GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE.
Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE  FOLLOWING THE ELECTION BUT HE  WAS NOT THE NOMINEE. THEY ENDED UP GOING WITH THE  ROMNEY. TRADEMARK BY THE WAY. SO THAT GUY WAS WAY OFF. DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE THINKS,  RIGHT? BUT IT DOES
I BELIEVE THE MINIMUM RESULT  WILL BE 53-47 ROMNEY, OVER 300  ELECTORAL VOTES AND THE REPUBLICANS WILL PICK UP THE  SENATE. I BASE THAT ON JUST YEARS AND  YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.
Jon: OF BEING WRONG. SO OBVIOUSLY ON WEDNESDAY OR,  GOD FORBID THURSDAY OR DECEMBER  OR WHENEVER THIS THING IS FIGURED OUT, WE'LL KNOW WHICH  PUNNED IS WERE WRONG, WHICH WERE  WRONGER AND WHICH WERE "OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS REALLY WRONG."  I CAN SHOW YOU A PREDICTION  THAT'S WRONG TODAY. IT COMES VIA DICK MORRIS, KING  OF WRONG MOUNTAIN. IT CONCERNS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR  PUNDITS
ROMNEY IS GOING TO WIN. HE'S GOING TO WIN BY, I BELIEVE,  MORE THAN FIVE POINTS. I BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO GET MORE  THAN 300 ELECTORAL VOTES. YOU KNOW, AFTER THE ELECTION  EITHER I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GO  THROUGH A BIG RECKONING OR THEY  ARE.
Jon: NO, YOU WON'T AND THEY  WON'T. NOBODY WILL BECAUSE YOU'RE  PUNDITS. YOU LIVE IN A RECKONING-FREE  ZONE. ONE THING WE LEARNED IS THAT  PUNDITRY IS LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IN  PUNDITRY WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS,  NOBODY EVER MOVES THE [BLEEP] CHAIRS. THEY JUST KEEP ADDING MORE  CHAIRS. WE'LL BE RIGHT
