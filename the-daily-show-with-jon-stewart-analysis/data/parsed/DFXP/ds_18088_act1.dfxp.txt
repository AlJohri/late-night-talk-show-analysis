FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON  STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
HELLO. THANK YOU! YOU'RE HAVING KIND. WELCOME THE "DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A FINE PROGRAM.  MAZ, AUTHOR OF "THE WAY OF THE  KNIFE," STUNY EXPOAS A ON OUR  NATION'S TOP SPIES, CHEF. AS YOU KNOW, THIS COUNTRY HAS  SUFFERED. AND OF COURSE THE CONTINUING  SCOURGE OF GUN VIOLENCE. ALONG WITH THE TERRIBLE STORIES  ARE SOME UPLIFTING STORIES OF SO  MANY HEROS THAT HAVE EMERGED FROM THESE TRAGEDIES SO WE CAN  TAKE SOLACE THAT THOSE PEOPLE  ARE OUT THERE AND THAT OUR NATION'S LEADERS ARE ALSO ON THE  CASE.
ON WEDNESDAY, THE SENATE  BLOCKED THE MOST FAR-REACHING  GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION IN TWO  DECADES.
Jon:  I'M SORRY, DID I  SAY ON THE CASE? I MEAN KILL MY SOUL.
SENATORS VOTED DOWN AN SWP  BAN.
AND AGAINST A BAN ON  HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE.
THE U.S. SENATE HAS VOTED  DOWN THE COMPROMISE DEAL ON  EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS. THE VOTE WAS 54 FOR THE EXTENDED  BACKGROUND CHECKS, 46 AGAINST. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  AS TO THAT LAST  ONE, EXPANDING BACKGROUND CHECKS  TO COVER GUN SHOWS AND INTERNET  SALES. ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE  COULD TAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS  86% SUPPORT OF ALL AMERICANS AND AN EIGHT-VOTE MAJORITY IN THE  SENATE ITSELF AS A NO. THAT'S A NO. DID THESE ( BLEEP )-- I THINK  THAT'S TRADEMARKED BY DELTA  GAMMA. ( LAUGHTER ). DID-- REALLY? YOU ALREADY READ-- GOTTA TELL  YOU. THE THE INTERNET MOVES FAST! ( LAUGHTER )  DID THESE GUYS PASS ANYTHING OF  SUBSTANCE?
THIS AMENDMENT WILL ENSURE  THAT GUN OWNERS ACROSS THE  NATION DO NOT HAVE THEIR PRIVATE GUN OWNER INFORMATION PUBLICLY  RELEASED.
THE YAYS ARE 67, THE NAYS ARE  30. THE AMENDMENT IS AGREESED TO.
Jon:  WE CAN'T PUBLISH  WITH GUN OWNERS LIVE? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY  NEW MAGAZINE "GUNS & ADDRESSES"? ( LAUGHTER )  LOOK, AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH  THAT PROVISION, IT TURNS OUT THE  ONLY AMENDMENT WE'VE WITHIN ABLE TO CONTRADICT IS OF IN THE  POST-NEWTOWN WORLD IS THE FIRST.
I FIND IT SO INCREDIBLY  IRONIC THAT ITS PROPONENTS  THINKS THESE WEAPONS ARE A PROBLEM IN THE HANDS OF  LAW-ABIEGD CITIZENS, BUT  APPARENTLY SEE NO PROBLEM WITH THE SAME WEAPONS BEING  GALORIFIED IN HOLLYWOOD MOVIES  OR VIDEO GAMES, WHERE THE GAME IS INTERACTIVE, VIOLENT, AND YOU  ARE LITERALLY SHOOTING AT  PEOPLE.
Jon:  THAT'S ONE, VIDEO  GAMES YOU ARE NOT LITERALLY  SHOOTING AT PEOPLE. ( LAUGHTER )  WHAT YOU'RE SHOOTING IT ISAISE  SERIES OF 0s AND 1s  ORGANIZED INTO A TWO-DIMENSION STALL REPRESENTATION OF A  THREE-DIMENSIONAL-- I GUESS I'M  NOT CONSIDERING THE REAL-WORLD CONSEQUENCES OF CHECKING TO SEE  IF SOMEONE BUYING A GUN ON THE  INTERNET IS A CONVICTED FELON WHO MODERATES A CHARLIE MANSON  MESSAGE BOARD. "HEY, GUYS, LET'S NOT GET OFF  TOPIC. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 'LIVE  WITH KELLY AND MICHAEL' THAT'S A  DIFFERENT BOARD. YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE  CONVERSATION HERE MANSON  RELATED."
IN MY OPINION, ADOPTING  MANDATORY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR PURELY PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN LAW  ABIDING CITIZENS PUTS INEXORABLY  ON THE PATH FOR A ITSELF  REGISTRATION.
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY PROPOSED  BUT IF THE BILL BEING CONSIDERED  WERE ADOPTED, IT WOULD PUTTOUS THAT PATH.
Jon:  WHAT ABOUT THE PATH  WE ARE ACTUALLY ON NOW? I BELIEVE IT'S AT THE CORNER OF  CARNAGE ROAD AND BANG-BANG  BOULEVARD. YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN'T TURN OFF  BECAUSE THE EXIT RAMP MIGHT  MERGE INTO A GOVERNMENT REGISTRY OFF RAMP THAT COULD, IF YOU GO  FAR ENOUGH DOWN AND ON, I DON'T  KNOW, STALIN AVENUE OR HITLER WAY, OR WORSE THE L.I.E., WHICH  REALLY, REALLY IS BAD? BUT NOTHING EMBODIED YESTERDAY'S  CYNICAL EXERCISE IN DISINGENUOUS  DEBATE MORE THAN THIS NEXT LINE OF ARGUMENT.
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD NOT  RESTRICT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN  LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WILL NOT PREVENT SUCH  TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CRIMINALS.
WE OUGHT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE  CAN'T LEGISLATOR AWAY THE EVIL  THAT IS ABOUT US.
PEOPLE WHO STEAL GUNS DO NOT  SUBMIT TO BACKGROUND CHECKS.
Jon:  RIGHT! BUT PEOPLE WHO STEAL GUNS DO NOT  SUBMIT TO OUR RULES ABOUT  STEALING. ( LAUGHTER ). BUT WE STILL HAVE THEM. ( LAUGHTER )  HERE'S WHAT'S SO CRAZY ABOUT  THIS--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY, THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO SPEND  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GET  ELECTED TO A LEGISLATIVE BODY KNOWN AS THE SENATE ARE MAKING  THE ARGUMENT THERE'S REALLY NO  POINT IN MAKING LAWS BECAUSE CRIMINALS ARE JUST GOING TO END  UP BREAKING THEM. ( LAUGHTER ). HEY, MAN, LET ME ASK YOU A  QUESTION, TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN  THE SENATE--  ( APPLAUSE ) "DO YOUR DOORS HAVE LOCKS ON  THEM?"  BECAUSE MY GUESS IS MOST  CRIMINALS DON'T GO, "OHEY,  EVERYBODY. LOCKED."  ( LAUGHTER )  AND YOU KNOW IF THESE SENATORS  WERE CONSISTENT IN THEIR  FUNDAMENTAL ASSERTION THAT EVIL CANNOT BE LEGISLATORRED AGAINST,  I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THEM BUT I  WOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME DISDAIN FOR THEM. THERE ARE SITUATION WHERE'S THE  EXACT SAME PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE  WILLING TO INFRINGE UPON CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS THROUGH  THE POWER OF LEGISLATION.
WE NEED NEW TECHNIQUES IN THE  WAKE OF 9/11 IN ORDER TO PROTECT  US.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE  CONTINUE TO GIVE OUR LAW  ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY EVERY TOOL THEY NEED TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
THE AUTHORITY GIVEN TO THE  F.B.I. IS A NECESSARY CHANGE IN  OUR LAWS TO COMBAT THE WAR ON  TERROR.
THE CAPABILITIES IT NEEDED TO  DETECT AND DETER TERRORISM  INSIDE OUR BORDERS.
IMPORTANT TOOLS USED TO  INVESTIGATE AND PREVENT  TERRORIST ATTACKS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS A  RESPONSIBILITY TO USE EVERY  LEGAL MEANS AVAILABLE TO HIM TO GET INTELLIGENCE THAT HE CAN USE  TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES.
Jon:  I THOUGHT THAT WAS  THE WHOLE POINT. BUT I GUESS TERROR IS DIFFERENT. TERRORISM HAS BEEN A MUCH  GREATER THREAT TO AMERICAN  SAFETY OVER ALL THESE YEARS.
IN THE LAST 30 YEARS THERE  HAVE BEEN 30,000 TO 40,000 GUN  DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES PER PER YEAR. SINCE 19 BE 70 THERE HAVE BEEN  3400 TERROR FATALITIES.
Jon:  HOLY. WELL, THANK GOD FOR CHRIS HAYES  BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD AT MATH. I'M SO STUPID I STILL THINK 54  VOTES IS MORE THAN 46. I'M AN IDIOT. BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT A  MILLION IS MORE THAN 3400. AND YET TO BATTLE THE EVIL OF  TERROR, WE STARTED TWO WARS,  TORTURED PEOPLE, REORGANIZED ALMOST THE ENTIRE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT, DISALLOWED THE AIR  TRAFFICKING OF SHA52 AND SHAM PEW AND CONDITIONER, AND OKAY'D THE  ROBOT SKY KILLING OF AMERICAN  CITIZENS IF WARRANTED BY  SOMEONE. BECAUSE ONE AMERICAN LIFE LOST  TO TERROR IS ONE TOO MANY. WHICH I AGREE WITH. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WE'LL MOVE  HEAVEN AND EARTH TO DO WHATEVER  IT TAKES TO KEEP WEAPONS FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF  FOREIGNERS WHO MIGHT KILL OUR  CITIZENS BECAUSE APPARENTLY WE THINK KILLING OUR CITIZENS IS  OUR JOB. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
