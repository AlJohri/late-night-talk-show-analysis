Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A  DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER. HIS LATEST IS HBO'S "HUNTED:   THE WAR AGAINST GAYS IN  RUSSIA".
WE HAVE SEEN AN ENORMOUS  ATTACKS AGAINST GAYS AND LESBIANS THAT HAVE MULTIPLIED ACROSS RUSSIA. THEY USE THE PRETEXT OF FIGHTING PEDOPHILIA IN RUSSIA TO ATTACK GAY PEOPLE. IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT THEY SOMETIMES EITHER PRETEND OR THEY DON'T KNOW GENUINELY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEDOPHILIA AND HOMOSEXUALITY. AND THEY USE THESE WORDS  INTERCHANGEABLY IN THEIR  DIALOGUE WITH THE VICTIM.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME, BEN  STEELE. BEN, SIR! (APPLAUSE) SO I WANT TO GET SOME CONTEXT  FOR THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE SHOWED, THAT WAS A  CLIP OF SOMEONE FROM A HUMAN  RIGHTS GROUP.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHO WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THIS ANTI-GAY VIOLENCE IN RUSSIA THAT HAS REALLY SPIKED OVER -- WHAT, WHAT PERIOD?
THE LAST TWO YEARS  REALLY. THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE  ACROSS RUSSIA. AND THERE ARE VIGILANTE GROUPS THAT LURE GAY PEOPLE TO MEET UP AND THEN ASSAULT THEM, ATTACK THEM VIOLENTLY, AND HUMILIATE THEM AS WELL, SOMETIMES POURING URINE ON THEM.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND OUTING THEM AS WELL BY POSTING MOVIES THAT THEY THEN PUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
Jon: AND THEY ARE, THEY ARE ACTIVELY  SOLICITING FOR THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY AND WHEN THEY DRAW THEM IN THEY ATTACK THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: SO THE FILM HAS  INCREDIBLY NAUSEATING FOOTAGE  OF THESE GROUPS. THEY'VE ALLOWED YOU IN TO FILM  THEM. WE COULD HAVE SHOWN A CLIP OF THAT, BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO SEE IT IN FULL CONTEXT, BECAUSE IT'S, IT'S DISGUSTING. AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME  WAS THAT NOBODY THAT YOU WERE  FILMING WENT TO YOU AFTERWARDS  AND WENT, COULD YOU BLUR MY  FACE? BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE, WHAT WE'VE ALLOWED YOU TO FILM IS HORRIBLE.
YEAH WELL, THE VIGILANTE GROUPS, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY'RE PROUD OF WHAT THEY DO. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE  CARRYING OUT GOOD ACTS, AND  THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE ACTING IN  THE NAME OF THE MAJORITY OF  RUSSIAN PEOPLE, AND THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE THE TACIT SUPPORT OF RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES. SO --
Jon: THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE IT, OR THEY HAVE IT?
WELL, OF COURSE, LAST YEAR THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PASSED A LOOSELY WORDED ANTI-PROPAGANDA LAW WHICH BANNED WHAT THEY CALL THE PROMOTION OF  HOMOSEXUALITY. AND EXPLICITLY MAKES REFERENCE TO YOUNG PEOPLE, TO MINORS, AND  WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING  THERE IS IT'S LINKING  HOMOSEXUALITY FALSELY, THEY'RE MAKING A CLAIM THAT SOMEHOW IT'S DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN. AND THAT'S WHY THE GROUPS CLAIM AGAIN FALSELY THAT HOMOSEXUALITY AND PEDOPHILIA IS ONE AND THE SAME THING.
Jon: SO IN OTHER WORDS, THEY CAN, AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY FILM THESE ATTACKS, THEY UPLOAD THEM, AND THEN THEY ARE NOT PROSECUTED, BUT THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE FILM CAN LOSE THEIR  JOB, AND HAS NO RECOURSE?
THAT'S RIGHT. SO, THE VIGILANTES ARE NOT  CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE  OF THE AUTHORITIES. AND THEY DON'T, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HAPPY TO SHOW THEIR FACES.
Jon: AND WHEN SOMEONE -- IS  THERE ANY DISCUSSION OPENLY,  YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF  PROPAGANDA ON RUSSIAN NETWORKS  WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING -- YOU KNOW, CAUSE I KNOW THERE'S, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE IN RUSSIA, WE FILMED SOME GAY GROUPS AND SAID NO, WE'RE GOING TO STAY HERE, WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT FROM THE INSIDE. DO THEY HAVE ANY ACCESS TO A PLATFORM TO SAY THAT IS A RIDICULOUS LINK. IT IS NOT THE SAME THING, AND  THIS HAS TO STOP?
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT. UNFORTUNATELY, BOTH THE STATE  AND THE CHURCH ARE REINFORCING THE IDEA THAT PEDOPHILIA AND HOMOSEXUALITY HAVE SOME KIND OF LINKAGE. AND WE FILMED, YOU'LL SEE THE DOCUMENTARY, OR YOU HAVE SEEN, AN ATTEMPT BY GAY PEOPLE TO DEMONSTRATE AND TO TAKE  ACTION.
Jon: WELL THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWED -- IT'S CRAZY -- ONE PERSON CAN DEMONSTRATE.
THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. WHEN WE FILMED THAT ONE PERSON WAS ALLOWED TO DEMONSTRATE AT A TIME, AND EVEN THEN HE WASN'T ALLOWED TO USE THE PHRASE HOMOSEXUALITY OR GAY. HE JUST SAID LET'S STOP HATE CRIMES.
Jon: BECAUSE THAT'S PROPOGANDA. BECAUSE THAT COULD BE PROPOGANDA. THAT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS PROPAGANDA. AND OF COURSE, THE POLICE COME ALONG AND CLOSE DOWN HIS ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE EVEN THEN.
Jon: AND THIS IS REALLY, THOUGH, YOU KNOW, RUSSIA IS NOT, YOU KNOW, A BACK WATER COUNTRY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: THIS IS A SOPHISTICATED  COUNTRY. THEY HAVE A HUGE GAY  COMMUNITY, A VERY ACTIVE GAY  COMMUNITY. AND IT'S JUST -- SO WHAT DO THEY DO NOW AS THE CULTURE HAS TURNED SO QUICKLY AND VIOLENTLY?
YEAH WELL, IT'S VERY DISTURBING AND DISTRESSING, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, RUSSIA HAS A HUGE GAY COMMUNITY. BUT THE MAJORITY OF GAY PEOPLE IN RUSSIA DON'T LIVE -- THEY REMAIN CLOSETED.
Jon:  RIGHT.
THEY DON'T LEAD OPEN LIVES. IT'S JUST ONE PERCENT ARE COMPLETELY OPEN ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE JUST TOO AFRAID TO COME OUT, AND IT'S A REALLY SAD SITUATION.
Jon: WHEN YOU APPROACH  THESE GROUPS, HOW DO YOU --  ARE THEY OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT  YOU WILL FILM IT? LIKE, DID IT TAKE CONVINCING? OR DID YOU JUST SAY, HEY, MAN, CAN I FOLLOW YOU WITH A CAMERA AND WATCH YOU BE HORRIBLE?
WELL, IT WAS, IT WAS A LONG  NEGOTIATION PROCESS OVER  SEVERAL MONTHS, AND MAKING  CONTACTS WITH THE VIGILANTE  GROUPS THEMSELVES TOOK TIME. I SPEAK RUSSIAN, SO I WAS  ABLE TO BUILD --
Jon: I MEAN, WE ALL SPEAK RUSSIAN. THAT'S NOTHING TO THROW IN THERE -- BELIEVE ME. (LAUGHTER)
SO I WAS ABLE TO BUILD MORE  OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PEOPLE  THAT I WAS MEETING AND TO EXPLAIN ESSENTIALLY I'M THERE NOT AS TO PASS JUDGMENT. I'M THERE TO FILM WHAT'S  HAPPENING SO THAT I CAN SHOW  IT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD,  AND IT'S FOR THE VIEWER TO  JUDGE THE RIGHTS AND THE  WRONGS AND THE MERITS OF WHAT  THEY'RE DOING. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE PROUD OF --
Jon: AND THEY REALLY THOUGHT, OH YOU'LL GIVE US A FAIR SHOT, GREAT. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
AND I THINK THE DOCUMENTARY  IS FAIR. I THINK IT DOES SHOW --
Jon: OH, IT IS OBJECTIVE. I MEAN, IT IS OBJECTIVE.
YEAH. YEAH. AND OF COURSE, SO THE ACCESS WHICH I HAD WAS ALSO VERY MUCH ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I'D BE FILMING LATER THAT DAY OR EVEN IN AN HOUR OR TWO. I WAS JUST LITERALLY TAGGING ALONG WITH THEM. AND YOU KNOW, EVEN --
Jon: AND IN THEIR VIOLENCE YOU SEE IN IT. THEY WANT TO YOU SHUT IT DOWN. LIKE THEY GO AT YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT. SO IN ONE OF THE SCENES WHEN A YOUNG MAN UNEXPECTEDLY COMES IN, HE'S BEEN LURED TO THE FLAT AND THEY THEN START  TO ASSAULT HIM. THEY PUSH ME OUT OF THE ROOM. I FORCED MY WAY BACK IN, AND  THEY ORDERED ME TO PUT THE  CAMERA DOWN, BUT I KEEP ON FILMING FOR TWO REASONS. ONE, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SHOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, THROUGH AN UNFILTERED LENS. SHOW TO THE WORLD. BUT ALSO BECAUSE I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THAT YOUNG MAN.
Jon: OH I --
AND BY FILMING, I FEEL THAT I AM ACTUALLY ACTING AS A BREAK ON THE VIOLENCE WHICH COULD OCCUR.
Jon: RIGHT. IT'S PHENOMENAL ACCESS TO SOMETHING YOU REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING IS REAL, AND I TRULY HOPE THEY GET HBO IN RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO. CHANCES ARE THEY DON'T. BUT IT'S A REMARKABLE WORK. AND YOU KNOW, AS THEY SAY, SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT. BUT, "HUNTED: THE WAR AGAINST GAYS IN RUSSIA", IT PREMIERES MONDAY OCTOBER 6th ON HBO. BEN STEELE.
THANK YOU.
Jon: NICE WORK. (APPLAUSE)
