Jon: AS THE GREAT HERMAN MELVILLE WROTE IN HIS CLASSIC MOBY DICK, OR THE WHALE, LET THE MOST ABSENT MINDED OF MEN BE PLUNGED IN HIS DEEPEST REVERIES, STAND THAT MAN ON HIS LEGS SAID HIS FEET, AND HE WILL INFALLABLY LEAD TO YOU WATER. (LAUGHTER) DIDN'T EXPECT SILENCE ON THAT ONE. READ TO US, BOY, READ TO US. IT'S LATE AND OUR EYES ARE WEARY. (LAUGHTER) THE SEAFARING TRADITION IS A NOBLE ONE, THUS TONIGHT WE EXAMINE A FEW RECENT MARITIME STORIES IN A SEGMENT WE CALL, REALLY, IS THAT WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT? (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I READ FROM MELVILLE. IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE GRAVITY THAT WE WERE-- FINE. FIRST UP, PUZZLING MARITIME NEWS FROM THE BAY AREA.
MORE THAN A MONTH AFTER THE AMERICA'S CUP SOMETHING ELSE IS GRABBING ATTENTION THIS MORNING ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY.
Jon: PLEASE TELL ME IT IS NOT ANOTHER GHIRARDELLI CHOCOLATE DRILLING STATION DISASTER. STILL LICKING CHOCOLATE OFF THE BIRDS FROM THE LAST ONE.
FOUR STORIES HIGH, THIS BUILDING MADE OF CARGO CONTAINERS FIRST APPEARED A FEW MONTHS AGO. SITTING ON A BARGE 250 FEET LONG AND 72 FEET WIDE. ON TOP ARE DOZENS SPIRES THAT COULD BE MASTS OR FLAG POLES OR ANTENNAS. WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S OFF LIMITS TO THE PUBLIC AND GUARDED BY PRIVATE SECURITY, CNET REPORTER DANIEL TERDIMAN BEGAN INVESTIGATING AND SOON UNEARTHED LEGAL DOCUMENTS SHOWING THAT GOOGLE IS INVOLVED.
NOBODY OUTSIDE GOOGLE REALLY KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
Jon: THAT'S WEIRD, IT'S A GOOGLE PROJECT THAT NO ONE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNOWS WHAT IT IS. I GUESS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IT IS GOOGLE PLUS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!  -- BOOM! NOTE TO SELF, GOOGLE SHOULDER INJURY. LET'S SEE, A MYSTERIOUS GOOGLE PROJECT, WELL, I HAVE A PUCKISH NOTION FOR HOW WE MIGHT CLEAR THIS UP. YOU MIGHT FIND IT A BIT MISCHIEFOUS. PERHAPS WE USE THE INTERNET AND GOOGLE IT.
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN GET THE ANSWERS JUST BY GOOGLING IT, GUESS AGAIN. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: YOU HAVE MADE A POWERFUL ENEMY VOICE-OVER GUY.
I SEEM TO RECALL ANOTHER ODD STORY FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR.
GOOGLE TAKING ITS TECHNOLOGY TO THE STRATOSPHERE RELEASING 30 HIGH-TECH BALLOONS THAT WILL BRING WIFI INTERNET TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T CONNECTED.
Jon: RIGHT, WIFI. DON'T MOST INTERNET HUBS LOOK LIKE GIANT HOVERING JELLYFISH? I'M SURE GOOGLE IS NOT USING THE SECRET BARGES TO TEACH OCEAN CREATURES TO FLY SO THEY CAN RULE THE SEA AND AIR. IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?
LET'S BE CLEAR, IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR AN INTERNET SEARCH ENGINE TO LAUNCH SECRET OCEAN VESSELS. THAT'S WHY THERE IS NO BING DINGHY OR-- BINGEY, YOU THINK I'M OVERLY ALARMED BY GOOGLE'S BOND VILLAINESQUE AMBITION AND REACH.
GOOGLE LAUNCHED A NEW COMPANY NAMED CALICO THAT WILL TRY TO REVERSE THE AGING PROCESS AND EXTEND LIFE. "TIME" MAGAZINE IS FEATURING THE VENTURE ON A COVER ARTICLE POSING THE QUESTION, CAN GOOGLE SOLVE DEATH?
Jon: WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, GOOGLE? FIRST OF ALL, SOLVE DEATH? HOW ABOUT FIRST YOU MAKE ALL YOUR APPLICATIONS RUN THE CORRECT WAY ON THE IPHONE. THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT CONQUERING OBLIVION'S ICY KISS. WHATEVER IS GOING ON AT LEAST WE CAUGHT IT EARLY. FIRST THING WE DO IS CONTAIN THIS TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BARGE. QUARANTINE IT YOU CAN'T LET THIS THING MULTIPLY.
ANOTHER BARGE REPORTED TO BE REGISTERED TO THE SAME COMPANY AS THE ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO APPEARED ON THE SHORES OF PORTLAND, MAINE LAST WEEK.
Jon: I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS HOW THE MOVIE CLOVERFIELD STARTED. WATCH OUT, STATUE OF LIBERTY. LOOK, JUST TO RECAP. GOOGLE IS SURROUNDING US ON THE WATER, WATCHING US FROM THE SKY, AND NOT FOR NOTHING, CONSTANTLY MONITORING, RECORDING EVERY SINGLE STREET IN THE COUNTRY AND NOW THEY WON'T EVEN LET US DIE. (LAUGHTER) AM I THE ONLY ONE FEELING THREATENED. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THE I'M FEELING LUCKY BUTTON ON GOOGLE SHOULD REALLY BE DO YOU FEEL LUCKY? WELL, DO YOU? PUNK?
