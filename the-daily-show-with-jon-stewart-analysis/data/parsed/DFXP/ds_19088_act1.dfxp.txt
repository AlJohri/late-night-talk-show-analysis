FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. MY GUEST WILL BE DENIS LEARY. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF MEDITATION AND OUR FAVORITE PALESTINIAN POLISH CUISINE. [LAUGHTER] BUT FIRST -- A LITTLE DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING EARLIER IN THE AUDIENCE. [LAUGHTER] THE END OF MARCH SAW THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ENROLLMENT DEADLINE. IT WAS A CRUCIAL TEST FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THEY SET AN AMBITIOUS GOAL LAST SEPTEMBER.
I THINK SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST 7 MILLION PEOPLE SIGNING UP BY THE END OF MARCH 2014.
Jon: AND FAILURE LOOKS ME ME PRETENDING WE NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION. C'MON. 7 MILLION ENROLLEES WITH A WEBSITE YOU COULDN'T LOG ONTO FOR A MONTH, AND GOVERNMENT MANDATED ABORTION PANELS FOR PUPPIES. YOU'LL NEVER GET THERE.
IN 5 MONTHS ALLEGEDLY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE SIGNED UP. THEY EXPECT TO GET THREE MORE MILLION IN ONE MONTH. WOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER.
Jon: DISASTER! IT'S A FEVER DREAM. A PREPOSTEROUS FANTASY FIT MORE BY THE OUTLANDISH RAMBLINGS OF AN OPIATE FIEND AS HE LAYS BABBLING IN A DRUG INDUCED STUPOR ON A SOILED ALPHABET CITY MATTRESS. I WATCHED CHINATOWN LAST NIGHT, I'M SORRY. SO THE DEADLINE PASSED. GIVE US THE TOTAL.
7.1 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE NOW SIGNED UP FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS THROUGH THESE MARKETPLACES. 7.1.
Jon: WOW. GOT IT ALMOST EXACTLY. [LAUGHTER] WITH A HEALTHY 1.4% MARGIN OF ERROR THAT WILL EASE SUSPICIONS. QUEUE THE CELEBRATION.
HOW REAL ARE THOSE NUMBERS?
THIS IS A PHONY NUMBER.
I ACTUALLY THINK THE WHITE HOUSE IS STRAIGHT UP LYING ABOUT THESE NUMBERS.
THIS IS A SHAM.
I THINK THEY ARE COOKING THE BOOKS ON THIS.
Jon: IF I KNOW THIS ADMINISTRATION THEY ARE PROBABLY STEAMING THE BOOKS INSTEAD OF COOING THEM WITH OIL OR BUTTER. MIGHT GIVE THE BOOKS SOME FLAVOR, AND THEY'RE PROBABLY SERVING MACROBIOTIC KALE WITH THE BOOKS. AND FOR DESSERT WITH THE BOOKS SOME SORT OF MIDDLE EASTERN HONEY PASTRY WITH FLAXSEED THAT NOBODY LIKES AND THEN AFTERWARDS THEY'LL COMPOST THEIR STEAMED BOOK (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] COMMUNISTS. [ LAUGHTER ] HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS RATHER FORTUITOUS INCREASE.
7.1 MILLION FOLKS HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE BECAUSE PEOPLE GOT THE WORD OUT. WE DIDN'T MAKE A HARD SELL.
Jon: WHAT? [LAUGHTER] WORD OF MOUTH. YOU DIDN'T MAKE A HARD SELL. THE SIGNUP WAS THE CENTER PIECE OF YOUR STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. YOU TALKED IT UP ON ELLEN, ON RACHEL RAY, ON THE TONIGHT SHOW, ENLISTED AN ARMY OF PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, EVERY ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD. YOU SAT BETWEEN TWO FERNS AND THEN THERE WAS WHATEVER THE HELL THIS IS. ♪ LISTEN TO ME, A TALKING PUG YOU SEE IF YOU GET HEALTH INSURANCE PREVENTATIVE CARE IS NOW FREE ♪
Jon: DIDN'T GIVE THE HARD SELL? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR GOD SAKES YOU TAUGHT A DOG TO RAP ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. EVEN THE TACO BELL CHIHUAHUA WAS LIKE YO QUIERO, WE GET IT. BUT APPARENTLY, ACCORDING TO BRENT BOZELL OF THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA RESEARCH (bleep), I MEAN CENTER. [ LAUGHTER ] THE GOVERNMENT HAD A SECRET OBAMACARE ENROLLMENT SELLING WEAPON.
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR THE SPANISH LANGUAGE TELEVISION NETWORK UNIVISION HAS EMBARKED ON THEIR OWN COMPANY WIDE EFFORT TO GET LATINOS SIGNED UP FOR THE EXCHANGES.
Jon: BASTARDOS! HOW DARE A CABLE NETWORK USE ITS REACH TO HELP THE AUDIENCE COMPLY WITH THE LAW. THAT'S NOT NEWS. FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL. AL. BRENT BOZELL, FOX, ARE THEY MAKING TOO MUCH OF THE LIBERAL BIAS OF UNIVISION AND TELEMUNDO?
JON,  IF YOU ASK ME THEY ARE NOT MAKING ENOUGH OF IT. THESE NETWORKS SHOULD BE RENAMED BARACK-A-VISION AND OBAMA -MUNDO. THEY ARE PRACTICALLY FORCING LATINOS TO SIGN UP FOR HEALTH CARE. [SPEAKING SPANISH]
Jon: THAT JUST STRIKES ME AS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS THE LAW. THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT, DON'T THEY?
EXACTLY. WHERE IS THE UNDERMINING? THE FEAR-MONGER? THE PART ABOUT HOW OBAMACARE WILL KILL MY ABUELITA? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION? HERE IS HOW.  ♪  [LAUGHTER]  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S HOW YOU COVER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WITH THE FAIR AND BALANCED MASHUP OF OBAMACARE, CONTAGION AND THE WALKING DEAD CREDITS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO THE VIEWERS CAN DECIDE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT OBAMACARE.
Jon: RIGHT AFTER THEIR CHANGE THEIR PANTS. THAT WAS TERRIFYING.
THIS IS NOT A JOKE, JON. I MEAN, OBAMA -- [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU ARE RIGHT. I APOLOGIZE.
IT'S NOT A JOKE AT ALL.
Jon: YOU ARE RIGHT.
OBAMACARE IS JUST THE FIRST STOP ON THE UNIVISION, TELEMUNDO PROPAGANDA TRAIN. LOOK AT THIS BLATNT GLOBAL WARMING PROPAGANDA: [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHTER] THOSE OUTFITS SCREAM THE POLAR ICE CAPS ARE MELTING. I'M SO HOT. LET'S DO A BODY SHOT BEFORE THE WORLD ENDS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THE LIPS ARE VERY POUTY BUT I DON'T -- TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST I CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD REASON WHY THE METEOROLOGISTS WOULD DRESS THAT WAY. SO POINT TO YOU ON THAT ONE.
NOW YOU GET WHAT THEY ARE UP TO. IT'S ONE THING TO LURE US IN WITH THE LIBERAL WEATHER SIRENS BUT THEY ARE EVEN USING THEIR NINOS.
APPROVING THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE IS LOCO WE NEED RENEWABLES LIKE SOLAR.
ALL WOMEN DESERVE THE RIGHT TO FREE ON DEMAND BIRTH CONTROL. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: THAT IS CLEARLY YOU DUBBING A LITTLE BABY VOICE
THANK IS CRAZY SENOR JON. I MEAN THAT'S CRAZY JON.
Jon: WHERE SHOULD SPANISH SPEAKING AMERICANS GET THEIR NEWS AND WEATHER THEN?
HOW ABOUT FOX NEWS LATINO. HERE THEY ARE COVERING A RECENT RULE CHANGE THAT GIVES IMMIGRANTS A WAIVER FROM PENALTIES WHILE THEY WORK THEY ON LEGALIZING THEIR STATUS.
Jon: ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT ACTUALLY LOOKED VERY FAIR. IT SEEMED LIKE AN INFORMATIVE STORY FRAMED COMPASSIONATELY ABOUT AN ISSUE AFFECTING A LOT OF LATINOS. HEY YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING. YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST NOTICED FOX NEWS LATINO IS RIGHT NEXT TO FOX NATION ON THE TABS THERE.
OH HEY, YEAH YOU DON'T WANT TO CLICK ON THAT.
Jon: LET'S CLICK ON THAT, YEAH.
WOW.
SAME STORY JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE.
Jon: I'LL SAY. IT DIDN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE FAMILIES WERE BEING BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THAT PICTURE. I WONDER IF THE COMMENT SECTION IS ANY DIFFERENT.
DON'T. OH NO NO NO NO. I BEG OF YOU. IF YOU HAVE ANY DECENCY AT ALL AS A MAN. YOU ARE MY FRIEND.
Jon: WHAT'S IN THE COMMENTS SECTION? LET'S TAKE A LOOK. HOLY (bleep). OH, MY GOD!
I SAID DON'T LOOK AT THE COMMENTS. AND YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS.
Jon: HAVE THE POLICE BEEN ALERTED TO SARGIE? HAVE THEY BEEN --
LOOK JON, FOX WANTS TO REACH A LATINO AUDIENCE AND THEY WANT TO REACH A  CONSERVATIVE WHITE AUDIENCE WITHOUT THE TWO OF THEM FINDING OUT ABOUT EACH OTHER.
Jon: THEY ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER ON THE PAGE. THE TABS ARE THERE. YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM SEPARATE.
YOU CAN, ACTUALLY IF YOU BUILD A DANG FENCE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
PROBLEM SOLVED. EVERYONE IS HAPPY. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I NEED TO GO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH ON THE TELEMUNDO WEATHER GIRL PROPAGANDA.
Jon: YOU ARE GOING TO MASTURBATE TO THE WEATHER, AREN'T YOU?
SI. [LAUGHTER] AL MADRIGAL EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
