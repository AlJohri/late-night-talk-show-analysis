WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, A FORMER DAILY SHOW CORRESPONDENT, HIS NEW STAND-UP SPECIAL FOR NETFLIX IS CALLED "WYATT CENAC: BROOKLYN."
I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET  ABOUT BLACK DUDES IN THEIR 30s. WE DON'T RESPECT EACH  OTHER. WE DON'T. WE GET ALONG. BUT YOU TAKE ANY TWO BLACK DUDES IN THEIR 30s, I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU PUT THEM, YOU CAN PUT THEM IN THE LOBBY OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING, YOU CAN PUT THEM IN A CONFERENCE ROOM AT A FORTUNE 500 COMPANY, YOU CAN PUT THEM ON A SUBWAY TRAIN. THERE WILL BE A MOMENT, ONE  MOMENT WHEN THOSE TWO BLACK  DUDES WILL LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND EACH OF THEM WILL THINK IF THIS SUBWAY RIDE WERE TO ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST MAGICALLY TURN INTO A BASKETBALL GAME, HE CAN'T GUARD ME.
PLEASE WELCOME, MY GOOD FRIEND, WYATT CENAC. [ APPLAUSE ]
OH WOW. WYATT, [ APPLAUSE ]
OH WOW. WYATT, DID YOU MAKE THIS YOURSELF WITH YOUR HIPSTER HANDS? DID YOU CRAFT THAT?
IF YOU, IF THAT MAKES YOU ENJOY IT MORE, THEN YES, I MADE IT WITH MY HANDS.
IT DOES. I WANT TO TASTE YOUR HANDS IN THIS PIE.  SORRY,WHAT? DON'T YOU?
I DON'T KNOW WHY SOMEONE OOH-ED FOR THAT.
YEAH, I KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU, YOU DON'T THINK I WASH MY  HANDS? THAT'S FINE. THAT'S FAIR. I MEAN, I DON'T.
THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE A NEW  ASSUMPTIONS WITH THE BEARD AND  THE CLOTHING, BUT YEAH, I MEAN YOU COULD HAVE DRESSED UP.
I'M IN A TRANSITIONAL PHASE. I'M OUT OF WORK AND JUST KIND OF ENJOYING LIFE, RIDING THE RAILS.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.
YEAH. YEAH.
BUT THIS, LOOK AT THIS. HE RELEASED, HE RELEASED NOT ONLY A NETFLIX --
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BACK.
OH SORRY, HERE'S THE FRONT.
YOU CAN'T TELL, YOU CAN'T TELL.
WOW, YOU'RE ALREADY. YOU'RE ALREADY. WOW, WAY TO DO THE RESEARCH.
OH BOY.
HERE'S THE PROBLEM, I DON'T CARE.
THAT'S FAIR.
NO, HE'S GOT A NETFLIX SPECIAL. AND THEN LOOK AT THIS, HE'S RELEASED A COMEDY ALBUM ON VINYL. WHO DOES THAT? [ APPLAUSE ]
YEAH, I JUST DID JUST A THOUSAND COUNT LIMITED PRESSING BECAUSE I FIGURED IF I WAS GOING TO NAME A RECORD BROOKLYN, I SHOULD ALSO DO THE MOST SMALL BATCH ARISINAL I COULD DO AND MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR MOST PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT.
DO YOU THINK THAT, DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO HAVE RECORD PLAYERS?
I REALLY HOPE SO. I'VE GOT TO MAKE MY MONEY BACK  ON THIS.
I MEAN, THE GREATEST THING IS IT REALLY SMACKS OF EFFORT.
YEAH. YEAH.
THAT REALLY EMBODIES THE HIPSTER WAY.
YEAH. IT'S A VERY BROOKLYN THING TO DO. TO JUST, YEAH, I MADE A PIE.
YES, YOU DID.
YOU DID.
WE DON'T UMM --
WHY DID YOU, WHY DID YOU MAKE US A PIE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WELL BECAUSE YOU GUYS, YOU'RE, YOU'RE U.S. CITIZENS NOW.
WYATT, WE'RE CANADIAN AS APPLE PIE.
THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS TRUE.
I MADE THAT UP, THAT'S MY  CATCH PHRASE.
HOW DO YOU FEEL? DO YOU FEEL DIFFERENT? DO YOU FEEL NOW --
HERE'S HOW I FEEL. I FEEL THAT I KNOW SO MUCH MORE ABOUT THE UNITED STATES THAN MOST AMERICANS DO. BECAUSE WE HAD TO TAKE THE HARDEST TEST EVER.
A CIVICS TEST. YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CIVICS TEST.
A CIVICS TEST.
YOU HAVE TO PASS IT.
AND WE'RE SO BEHIND.
I BET YOU COULDN'T PASS THE CIVICS TEST.
NO CHANCE YOU COULD PASS IT.
COULD YOU PASS THE CIVICS TEST, WYATT? DO YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF?
WHEN WAS THE CONSTITUTION WRITTEN? GO!
CAN'T GOOGLE. CAN'T GOOGLE IN THE ROOM. CAN'T GOOGLE IN THE ROOM.
GIVE ME YOUR IPHONE. CAN'T GOOGLE.
LET'S -- I'M NOT AN AMERICAN  ANYMORE. THIS IS THE AMERICAN FOR ME. THIS IS, THIS KNOWS EVERYTHING.
THE LONGEST RIVER IN THE  UNITED STATES? GO.
I'M GONNA GO THE NILE.
NO.
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S SECOND. THAT'S SECOND. DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW? NO ONE?
ANYONE? (AUDIENCE RESPONDS)
NO, IT'S THE MISSOURI.
MISSOURI.
MISSOURI IS LONGEST.
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T SAY  MISSISSIPPI, BECAUSE I KNEW --
IT WASN'T THE MISSISSIPPI.
YEAH.
WHO WROTE THE FEDERALIST  PAPERS? THIS IS ON THE TEST. WHO WROTE THE FEDERALIST PAPERS?
GLEN BECK TALKS ABOUT IT A  LOT.
YES HE DOES, AND THAT'S AN ACCEPTABLE  ANSWER.
I ALSO I WANTED TO SHOW UP TOO, I APPRECIATE THAT YOU PLUGGED THE ALBUM.
YES. AND THE SPECIAL.
AND THE SPECIAL ON NETFLIX ON THE 21st.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO FOR YOU?
BUT ALSO I WANTED TO, YEAH.
YOU HAVE MORE PLUGS?
I WANT TO PLUG A FEW  MORE THINGS. I WANT TO PLUG JULES VERNE'S  20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA.
OKAY.
OKAY.
I'D LIKE TO PLUG THIS, IT'S AN AMAZING BOOK. IT'S APPARENTLY TRANSLATEED  AND WITH A FORWARD BY MENDOR T. BRUNETTI. GOTTA LOVE, GOTTA LOVE A BRUNETTI TRANSLATION.
HE DOES GOOD WORK.
HAVE YOU, HAVE YOU ACTUALLY READ IT? DO YOU --
NO, I HAVE NOT.
NO, OKAY.
NO, HERE'S WHAT I REALIZED, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO GET ON THE TALK SHOW CIRCUIT, IT'S HOW YOU RAISE YOUR PROFILE. JULES VERNE CAN'T PROMOTE HIS  BOOK ANYMORE. HE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO STEP IN  FOR HIM. SO, YOU KNOW, JULES VERNE, HE'S GONE.
YEP.
I'M ALSO PROMOTING CHARLOTTE  BRONTE BY JANE EYRE.
GREAT.
YEAH. THAT'S A GREAT ONE.
THAT'S A VERY YOU BOOK.
OKAY, THAT'S GONNA BE, THAT'S GONNA BE A CHALLENGE.
THE SCARLET LETTER BY  NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE. I'M JUST LOOKING TO DO THE TALK SHOW CIRCUIT, JUST PLUGGING BOOKS FOR DEAD AUTHORS.
YEP.
YEAH, YEAH.
THIS ONE'S SOME OF THE MOST FAVORITE WORDS RIGHT HERE.
GOOD, GOOD. HE'S PLUGGING THE DICTIONARY.
OH MY GOD, THAT'S SO --
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT WAS THE QUICKEST  INTERVIEW I EVER HAVE DONE IN  MY LIFE, AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT.
I KNOW. LET'S PUT THIS TO THE WEB LIKE FORTY FIVE MORE MINUTES.
YEAH.
FORTY FIVE MINUTES ON THE WEB. WE'RE GOING TO THE WEB. IN THE MEANTIME, "WYATT CENAC: BROOKLYN" WILL PREMIERE OCTOBER 21st ON NETFLIX. ALSO AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY ON VINYL. HERE IT IS. GIVE IT UP. WYATT CENAC.
