JANUARY 9, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT ONE TONIGHT, BABY. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS GEORGE LUCAS. LET ME SHOW YOU A CLIP OF OUR WRITERS' ROOM WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT WE HAD BOOKED MR. LUCAS. TAKE A LOOK. THAT'S OUR WRITERS' ROOM. BY THE WAY, IF YOU DO COME TO THE SHOW AND YOU WANT TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT WHICH  APPLIANCE I WOULD BE, LET ME JUST BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. DON'T YOU THEN SUGGEST A UTENSIL. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  BECAUSE I TAKE THESE THINGS  VERY SERIOUSLY. LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE REPUBLICANS' RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. TUESDAY IS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. THE CRUCIAL VOTE AND A KEY BELLWETHER FOR THE SOUTH CAROLINA VOTE 12 DAYS FROM  THEN WHICH YOU KNOW IS A-- (SNORING)-- THE REMAINING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES GATHERED  SATURDAY NIGHT ON ABC TELEVISION FOR A 9:00 P.M. DEBATE AND THEN INEXPLICABLY REASSEMBLED THE NEXT MORNING AT 9:00 A.M. ON NBC FOR ANOTHER DEBATE. IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES BECOME A TELETHON FOR ELECTORAL DYSTROPHY. THE 14th AND 15th DEBATE. I MEAN THEY'RE OUT OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. HERE WAS WHAT THEY WERE DOWN TO SATURDAY NIGHT.
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT AGAIN AS WE MEET. SO IF YOU WEREN'T HERE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING ON A SATURDAY NIGHT IN...?
Jon: AS A FOLLOW-UP, WHAT WOULD YOU BE WEARING? AND AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, REALLY, YOU'RE GOING TO GO OUT IN THAT? OBVIOUSLY IT'S A SILLY QUESTION. AND YET IT REVEALS THE SAD TRUTH OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. NO QUESTION IS TOO TRIVIAL TO NOT MERIT A PANDERING LIE.
I PROBABLY WOULD BE AT THE SHOOTING RANGE.
I'D BE WATCHING THE COLLEGE CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL GAME.
FOOTBALL GAME.
I MEAN, FOOTBALL GAME.
I'D BE WATCHING THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
FOOTBALL. I LOVE IT.
I'D PROBABLY READ AN ECONOMIC TEXTBOOK.
Jon: I BELIEVE ONE OF YOU, SERIOUSLY. IF YOU WENT DOWN THE LINE OF THE CANDIDATES THE REAL ANSWERS WOULD BE REAL  HOUSEWIVES, I'D BE WATCHING REAL HOUSEWIVES. REAL HOUSEWIVES. REAL HOUSEWIVES. REAL HOUSEWIVES. I'D BE READING AN ECONOMIC TEXTBOOK. IN FACT, THE SATURDAY DEBATE, THE SATURDAY DEBATE WAS SO LAME THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING PEOPLE EVEN WANTED TO TALK  ABOUT AFTERWARDS.
NOBODY REALLY WENT AFTER MITT ROMNEY.
A LOT OF THE RIVALS DIDN'T REALLY ATTACK HIM.
THE FIVE OPPONENTS TO MITT ROMNEY REALLY DIDN'T HIT HIM VERY HARD.
EVERYBODY THREW PUNCHES BUT FEW OF THEM AT MITT ROMNEY.
Jon: WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO KICK MITT ROMNEY IN THE BALLS? WE WANT TO KNOW. WELL, IT TURNS OUT THE PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED 10 HOURS LATER ON THE LORD'S DAY.
MITT, I REALIZE THE RED LIGHT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FRONTRUNNER.
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO STAND BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND RUN ON YOUR  RECORD, IT WAS THAT GREAT. WHY DID YOU BAIL OUT?
I WAS CRITICIZED LAST NIGHT BY GOVERNOR ROMNEY FOR PUTTING MY COUNTRY FIRST.
A RELATIVELY TIMID MASSACHUSETTS MODERATE.
THIS NATION IS DIVIDED, DAVID, BECAUSE OF ATTITUDE LIKE THAT.
CAN WE DROP A LITTLE BIT OF THE PIOUS BALOGNE. THE FACT IS YOU RAN IN '94 AND LOST. THAT'S WHY YOU WEREN'T SERVING.
Jon: WAIT. YOUR BALOGNE HAS A FIRST TIME AND IT'S PIOUS? THAT IS A TERRIBLE NAME FOR BALOGNE. MA'AM, CAN I HAVE A SANCTIMONIOUS CHEESE SANDWICH AND PIOUS BALOGNE. NEWT GINGRICH CALLING SOMEONE OUT FOR PIOUS BALOGNE. THAT WOULD BE LIKE NEWT GINGRICH WAXING POETIC ON THE SANTITY OF MARRIAGE.
IT IS BASED ON A MAN AND WOMAN AND HAS BEEN FOR 3,000 YEARS IS AT THE CORE OF OUR  CIVILIZATION AND SOMETHING WORTH PROTECTING AND UPHOLDING.
Jon: NOW THAT IS PIOUS BALOGNE. YOU KNOW WHAT? TO BE FAIR.... ( APPLAUSE ) TO BE FAIR, JOHNNY THREE WIVES IS RIGHT. WE MUST PROTECT MARRIAGE FROM GAY PEOPLE. IT'S NOT ADAM AND STEVE. IT'S ADAM AND EVE AND LATER TRISH AND EVENTUALLY BARBARA. ANYWAY, BUT WHAT OF THE FRONTRUNNER MITT ROMNEY? DID YOU MAINTAIN HIS LEAD THROUGH FOUR HOURS OF DEBATING? HE WAS ABLE TO EXPRESS TO THOUGHTS WITH NO RECOGNITION THAT HE HAD JUST DONE SO. HERE'S MITT ROMNEY, A, DISAVOWING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUPER PAC ADS NEWT GINGRICH IS COMPLAINING ABOUT  AND THEN, B, DEFENDING THE PRECISE CONTENT OF THOSE ADS AND GO.
WITH REGARDS TO THE ADS, I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM.
LET ME TELL YOU THIS, THE AD I SAW SAID THAT YOU'VE BEEN  FORCED OUT OF THE SPEAKERSHIP. THAT WAS CORRECT. SAID YOU AT DOWN WITH NANCY PELOSI AND ARGUED FOR A CLIMATE CHANGE BILL. THAT WAS CORRECT. AS PART OF AN INVESTIGATION AN ETHICS INVESTIGATION THAT YOU HAD TO REIMBURSE SOME $3,000. THOSE THINGS ARE ALL TRUE.
Jon: LET ME TELL YOU WHAT IS SPECIFICALLY IN THE ADS I NEVER SAW. THE WEIRD THING IS, WHY NOT JUST DEFEND IT? WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THAT. WHY WOULD YOU LIKE ABOUT THAT? I REFUSE TO LOOK AT THOSE STOLEN CELL PHONE PICTURES OF SCARLET JOHANSSON. WHAT'S UP WITH HOW GRAINY THEY ARE? I MEAN, NOBODY'S BODY IS THAT PERFECT. I MEAN, COME ON. KIND OF A BAD MOMENT THERE FOR MITT. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO REINFORCE THE OTHER ROM NOTICE STEREOTYPE THAT HE'S  SOME SORT OF ELITIST OUT OF TOUCH CAREER POLITICIAN.
I HAPPENED TO SEE MY DAD RUN FOR GOVERNOR WHEN HE WAS 54 YEARS OLD. HE HAD GOOD ADVICE TO ME. HE SAID, "MITT, NEVER GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS IF YOU HAVE TO WIN ELECTION TO PAY A  MORTGAGE."
Jon: WHAT A RELATEABLE STORY. MITT, REMEMBER, ONLY RUN FOR OFFICE WHEN YOU'RE RICH. I REMEMBER MY FATHER TAKING ME ASIDE DURING MY EARLY TEENAGE YEARS, WE WERE PLAYING CATCH  IN THE YARD AND HE ADVISED ME WITHHOLD RUNNING FOR OFFICE UNTIL MY ASSETS HAD A RATIO OF  30 TO 1 INCLUDING OF THE FOREIGN INDEMNITYS. DAD! ANYWAY, ROMNEY BEING ROMNEY EVEN THIS WEEK ATTEMPT AT RELATEABLE WAS DOOM TO RELAXED.
WHEN I SAW TED KENNEDY RUNNING IN 1994 A MAN BY VIRTUE OF THE POLICIES OF THE  LIBERAL WELFARE STATE HAD CREATED A PERMANENT UNDERCLASS IN THE AMERICA. I WAS HAPPY HE HAD TO TAKE A MORTGAGE OUT ON HIS HOUSE TO ULTIMATELY DEFENSE ME.
Jon: HE FORCED TED KENNEDY MISSOURI MORTGAGE ONE OF HIS HOUSES. WHAT A WEIRD RICH GUY THING TO BRAG ABOUT. DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME I BESTED RICHARD BRAN SENATE THAT ZIP LYNN AUCTION? I DROVE UP THE BIDDING ON A GOLD-PLATED DIRIGIBLE I DIDN'T EVEN WANT. BRANSON HAD TO SELL PART OF HIS ARCHIPELAGO. ALL OF THIS BRINGS US TO OUR NEW DAILY SHOW SEGMENT: HOW IS MITT ROMNEY KICKING ALL OF YOUR ASSES?
