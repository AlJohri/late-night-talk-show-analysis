Jon:  WELCOME BACK. YESTERDAY WE WERE TALKING-- REPUBLICAN LEADERS KNOW THAT IF THEY WANT TO KEEP SUCCEEDING IN ELECTIONS, THEY HAVE GOT TO EXPAND THEIR BASE BEYOND THAT GUY. ALL RIGHT. YESTERDAY WE TALKED ABOUT THEIR OUTREACH TO WOMEN. NOW THEY'RE COURTING ANOTHER GROUP, PEOPLE WHO DON'T HATE GAY PEOPLE.
SUPPORT OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE HAS NOW BECOME AN ISSUE OF PRIDE FOR REPUBLICANS.
THEY ARE NO LONGER RUNNING ON OPPOSITION TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BECAUSE IT'S A POLITICAL LOSER.
SPEAKER BOEHNER IS TRYING TO BROADEN THE TENT.
THE CHAIR OF THE R.N.C. SAYS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS NOT A TOP-TIER ISSUE.
Jon:  IT TURNS OUT THE SPECIES VOTORUS HOMOPHOBUS, WHOSE HABITAT ONCE RANGED ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION IS NEARING EXCTINCTION SO IF THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT ARE ALL FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF DOROTHY NOW, WHO DOES THAT LEAVE TO FIGHT ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY?
I UNBELIEVABLE IN OLD-FASHIONED TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
Jon:  HERE WE GO.
BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE TOO INVOLVED WITH THIS. AND I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CAN HAVE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE.
AND YOU COULD RETHINK IT AT SOME POINT, TOO? ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  I GUESS THE OLD SAYING IS TRUE-- IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM-- ( LAUGHTER ) FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR PANDERING CORRESPONDENT AL MADRIGAL. AL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NOW, IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT'S GOING ON. FIRST OF ALL, NICE TO SEE YOU. YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.
Jon:  IT'S INCREDIBLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE G.O.P. SOFTENING THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS GAY PEOPLE?
AH, IT'S GREAT, IT'S FINE. I MEAN, I'M VERY HAPPY FOR THEM. I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO LAST. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  YOU SOUND-- ACTUALLY, A LITTLE BITTER.
BITTER? NO! I MEAN I COULD PLAY SOMETHING FOR YOU FROM TWO YEARS AGO.
WE NEED TO DO MORE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONVEY OUR MESSAGE AS CONSERVATIVES TO THE HISPANIC POPULATION.
IF WE DON'T ENACT IMMIGRATION REFORM, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CANNOT WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION.
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH LATINOS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PARTY.
( SPEAKING SPANISH ) THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN DO, SORRY.
SEE THAT? THE G.O.P. WAS FALLING ALL OVER ITSELF PRETENDING TO LOVE LATINOS. THEY WERE ALL UP IN OUR CULOS. AND YOU KNOW HOW LONG THAT LOVE FIESTA LASTED? SIX ( BLEEP ) MONTHS.
THE REPUBLICAN BRAND IS SO TOXIC AMONGST LATINOS.
NO LATINOS WILL VOTE FOR THEM.
ON IMMIGRATION, REPUBLICANS WANT TO TAKE THAT ISSUE OFF THE TABLE.
AS SOON AS THE G.O.P. FIGURED OUT LATINOS DON'T EXACTLY VOTE REPUBLICAN LOCKSTEP, THEY TOSSED US OUT LIKE A FOUR-DAY-OLD CHIMICHANGA.
Jon:  LOOK THE G.O.P. THREW LATINOS OUT LIKE A FOUR-DAY-OLD CHIMICHANGA AND REPLACED YOU WITH--
FRESH, PIPING HOT GAYS. WELL, YOU KNOW, WHAT? THE JOKE'S ON THEM BECAUSE LATINOS ARE THE ORIGINAL GAYS. ( LAUGHTER )
Jon:  WHAT?
YUP, THAT'S RIGHT. WE INVENTED GAY, JON. THINK ABOUT IT. THOSE RUFFLED SHIRTS. TIGHT BATHING SUITS. MOJITOS.  IT'S THE GAYEST DRINK THERE IS. HERE, LOOK AT ME AT THE PUERTO RICAN DAY PARADE. THAT'S RIGHT.
Jon: YEAH.   ( APPLAUSE )
NOW  HERE I AM AT THE GAY PRIDE PARADE. CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE? I CAN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE BOTH SUPER FUN.
Jon:  YOU KNOW, I-- I DO GRANT YOU LATINO AND GAY CULTURES MAY HAVE SOME SUPERFICIAL SIMILARITIES.
SURE.
Jon:  ESPECIALLY, OBVIOUSLY, IN THE PARADE DEPARTMENT. BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THE DEEPER-- ( LAUGHTER ) WHAT ARE-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PERHAPS I CAN CONVINCE YOU BY ENJOYING THIS TRADITIONAL MEXICAN SNACK OF MY FORFATHERS. THE CHURRO. OOOH! MMM!
Jon:  CHURROS ARE NOT-- FOOD IS NOT GAY OR STRAIGHT. IT'S JUST --
REALLY? OH, YEAH. CHURRO IS FROM THE AZTEC WORD, CHURRO CACA, WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS MEANS CINNAMON DICK. SO YEAH, LEARN HOW TO SPEAK SPANISH.
Jon:  I, I -- YOU WOULD LIKE REPUBLICANS TO PAY LATINOS MORE ATTENTION NOW. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
OR, I MEAN EVEN SOME SIMPLE INDIFFERENCE, JON. WE'D BE HAPPY WITH ONE OF THOSE YOU KNOW EH. RIGHT? EH -- LIKE THE GAYS GOT. AT THIS POINT, WE WOULD LOVE A SHRUG OF GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE SO WE CAN GO ABOUT OUR LIVES LIVING, LOVING, AND ENJOYING OUR TRADITIONAL FOOD OF CINNAMON DICK. HEY, REPUBLICANS, I'M TOUCHING THEM TOGETHER. AAAH! AAAH!
Jon:  THANK YOU. AL MADRIGAL, EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
