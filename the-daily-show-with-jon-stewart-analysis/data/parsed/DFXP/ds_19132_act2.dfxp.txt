WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. YOU KNOW, THERE'S A SAYING, CRIME, CRIME DOESN'T PAY. BUT, SOMETIMES FIGHTING CRIME DOES, EVEN WHEN IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T. JORDAN KLEPPER EXPLAINS.
WE'VE ALL HEARD THE TRAVEL WARNINGS ABOUT BANDITOS COMMITTING HIGHWAY ROBBERY IN PLACES LIKE JUAREZ MEXICO, BUT NOW OUR POOREST BORDERS HAVE BROUGHT THIS SCOURGE INTO THE HEART OF AMERICA, WELL, TEXAS.
WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO A FAMILY GATHERING IN LINDEN, TEXAS, AND THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING STARTED.
AN INNOCENT FAMILY WAS DRIVING DOWN A TEXAS HIGHWAY WHEN SUDDENLY THEY WERE ROBBED AT GUNPOINT BY A DEVILISHLY HANDSOME BANDITO.
WHY ARE YOU IN THE RE-ENACTMENT?
HEY, DON'T TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
THEY SEARCHED THE CAR, FOUND MONEY ON US, AND THEN TOOK OUR MONEY.
WHERE THE [BLEEPED] WERE THE COPS.
THEY WERE THE COPS.
WHAT? THEY WERE ACTUAL COPS.
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A COP LOOKS LIKE.
THEY HAD POLICE UNIFORMS ON.
IS THIS THE MAN WHO PULLED YOU OVER.
LOOKS SIMILAR.
[BLEEPED], THAT'S A COP. WHAT KIND OF COP WOULD JUST TAKE SOMEONE'S MONEY. TO FIND A COP, YOU GOT ASK A COP, NYPD COP ROY RICHTER. ["LAW AND ORDER" THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
DOES THIS GUY LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU?
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT A FIRST GRADER DREW.
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TALK, MAYBE THIS WILL SWEETEN THE DEAL.
NO THANKS. I'M ON A DIET.
DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME, ROY. WE'RE TAKING THAT TAKE TO MAKE YOU TELL ME WHAT THE [BLEEPED] IS GOING ON.
ASK ME A QUESTION AND I'LL ANSWER.
OH, THAT WAS EASY. HE EXPLAINED SOMETHING CALLED CIVIL FORFEITURE.
SO YOU CAN PULL SOMEONE OVER ON THE HIGHWAY, TAKE THEIR STUFF AND THIS IS LEGAL?
IN THE CIVIL FORFEITURE ACTION, IT'S AUTHORIZED FOR A POLICE OFFICER TO SEIZE PROCEEDS OF A CRIME.
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GUILTY?
IF THEY HAVE CASH, THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY GOT THAT CASH FROM SELLING THOSE DRUGS.
OH, I GET IT. TIME TO FIND LITTLE MISS SCARFACE. AND SCORE AN OUNCE OF TRUTH.
SO WHERE WERE YOU GOING TO BUY DRUGS.
WE WEREN'T GOING TO BUY DRUGS.
WHERE WERE YOU GOING TO NOT BUY DRUGS?
TO LINDEN, TEXAS, WHERE THEY HAVE WILD FLOWER TRAILS.
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW TEXAS DRUG LINGO.
I'M NOT A DRUG DEALER.
SHE CONTINUED WITH HER STORY ABOUT A FREAKISHLY GOOD LOOKING COP WHO ACCUSED THIS STUNNING WOMAN AND HER DASHING HUSBAND TRAVELING WITH TWO VERY SYMMETRICAL CHILDREN OF BEING CROOKS JUST TO TAKE THEIR MONEY.
THE SAID LOOK, YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE DEAL, WE KNOW YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING, YOU'RE MONEY LAUNDERING. SO THEY GAVE US THE ULTIMATUM THAT WE CAN EITHER GIVE THEM OUR MONEY OR THEY WOULD TAKE OUR CHILDREN AWAY.
SO, WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOU GAVE YOUR KIDS AWAY?
THOSE ARE MY CHILDREN AND THERE'S NOT A MONEY AMOUNT THAT COULD TAKE THEM AWAY.
BUT SOME PEOPLE THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH COPS MAKING YOU CHOOSE BETWEEN YOUR KIDS AND YOUR CRASH, LIKE ACLU CRYBABY VANITA GUPTA. ["LAW AND ORDER" THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
CIVIL LAWSUIT FORFEITURE CREATES INCENTIVES FOR ABUSIVE POLICE PRACTICES. IN A LOT OF CASES IT IS GOING TO BE LESS COST EFFECTIVE FOR INNOCENT FOLKS TO HIRE A LAWYER FOR $5,000 TO TRY TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK.
WHAT WOULD POLICE OFFICERS HAVE TO GAIN BY TAKING INNOCENT PEOPLE'S STUFF?
MONEY.
BESIDES MONEY?
YOU KNOW, FUNDING FOR THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN SOME PLACES POLICE DEPARTMENTS ARE KEEPING 80% TO 100% OF THE ASSETS SEIZED.
IF YOU COULD CLAIM 100% OF THE ASSETS SEIZED, THAT [BLEEPED] WOULD HAPPEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE PLACE. THERE ARE SO MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE SWEPT UP IN THESE PRACTICES.
AND THE MORE INVESTIGATING I DID, THE MORE INNOCENT VICTIMS I FOUND.
THE COPS PULLED US OVER, SEARCHED OUR CAR FOR DRUGS, AND THERE WAS NO DRUGS. THEY JUST TOOK OUR MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE COPS. AND THEY COULD.
SO, THERE WERE NO DRUGS IN THE CAR?
NO DRUGS AT ALL.
BECAUSE YOU HAD INGESTED THEM?
NO.
BECAUSE YOU PUT THEM UP YOUR BUTT?
NO.
BLINK OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT MINUTE IF YOU HAD DRUGS IN YOUR ANUS.
NO, SORRY.
SO A FEW INNOCENT PEOPLE LIKE BOWRIGHT AND FLORES GET SWEPT UP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME AND MAYBE OVER 140 OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT SAME HIGHWAY IN TEXAS, AND THIS GUY IN THE BRONX, AND THIS COUPLE IN PHILLY AND ALL THESE PEOPLE OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT ADDS UP TO MUCH.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BANKING ON CLOSE TO $5 BILLION ON CIVILLY SEIZED ASSETS.
$5 BILLION?
CLOSE TO THAT.
THAT IS [BLEEPED] TERRIFYING. LOOKS LIKE OUR COP HAD TO COP TO WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON. EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS NOT HIGHWAY ROBBERY.
IF THE VICTIMS ARE INNOCENT, THERE'S A PROCEDURE WHERE THEY CAN GO THROUGH TO GET THAT MONEY BACK. THEY HAVE TO SHOW THEIR INNOCENCE BY BEING FOUND NOT GUILTY.
SO PROPERTY IS GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT?
THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE POLICE OFFICER. AND, IF THAT POLICE OFFICER HAS PROBABLE CAUSE.
AND, WE'LL FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE INNOCENT LATER. SO NEXT TIME A COP STOPS YOU AND ACCUSES YOU OF DEALING DRUGS, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP YOUR MONEY, JUST BE WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR SMOKING HOT KID. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
