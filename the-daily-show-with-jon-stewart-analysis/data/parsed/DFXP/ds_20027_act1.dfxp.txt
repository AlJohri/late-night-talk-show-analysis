FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VE GOT A VERY NICE PROGRAM TONIGHT. MY GUEST SHE'S GOT A FILM OUT CALLED "INTERSTELLAR," THE ALWAYS EXCELLENT JESSICA CHASTAIN WILL BE HERE. NEVER A BAD MOVIE FOR THAT LADY AND NEVER A BAD PERFORMANCE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHT ON THE LOCAL SIDE. ACROSS THE RIVER, MY OWN STATE, JERSEY. WHERE OUR FRIEND GOVERNOR CRISTOPHER CHRISTIE FINDS HIMSELF IN A BIT OF A SITUATION.
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HAS A PIG PROBLEM.
Jon:  NOW, NOW WAIT. WAIT. I DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PRODUCTIVE WAY, UNLESS I'M OBVIOUSLY JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS AND BY SOME ABSURD POLITICAL TWIST THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY LITERALLY HAS A PIG PROBLEM.
HE HAS TO DECIDE BY DECEMBER IF NEW JERSEY PIG FARMERS CAN USE GESTATION CRATES.
Jon: OH, HE HAS A PIG PROBLEM. HE HAS A PIG PROBLEM. [LAUGHTER] WELL YOU KNOW WHAT, WHY SHOULDN'T HE BE ABLE TO USE GESTATION CRATES? IT'S A FREE COUNTRY. I MEAN HOW MUCH DOES THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CLAMP DOWN. THEY FARMERS HAVE, NEED TO STORE THEIR, WHAT IS A GESTATION CRATE EXACTLY? [LAUGHTER]
THE CRATES ARE USED FOR PREGNANT PIGS TO PREVENT THEM FROM FIGHTING. FARMERS ALSO SAY THE PIGS ARE MUCH EASIER TO HOUSE THIS WAY.
Jon: RIGHT, NO, NO. THAT MAKES SENSE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP THEM IN THESE TINY CONFINED BOXES LIKE SHOES.  [LAUGHTER] THAT ARE ALIVE AND CAN FEEL PAIN. SHOES THAT CAN FEEL PAIN. [LAUGHTER] CLEARLY AN IMPROVEMENT OVER MOST PREVIOUS FORMS OF PIG HOUSING. YOUR STRAW. YOUR STICKS. [LAUGHTER] YOUR BRICKS. EVEN WITH THOSE COSTLY SPECIALIZED UNITS. EVEN WITH THOSE COSTLY UNITS FULLY TWO THIRDS OF YOUR PIGS ARE STILL VULNERABLE IN THAT SITUATION TO WOLF ATTACK. [LAUGHTER] WOW, IT'S REALLY. [LAUGHTER] I BELIEVE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE PIG BLOOD. [LAUGHTER] WELL LOOK, HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT, GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HAS TO WEIGH THE BENEFITS AGAINST THE COSTS. I MEAN THESE CRATES MIGHT HELP PIG FARMERS, AND WHAT IF ANY ARE THE DOWN SIDE TO THE CRATES.
THE HUMANE SOCIETY SAYS THAT THE EXTREME CONFINEMENT OF THE PIGS LITERALLY MAKES THEM GO INSANE. THE CRATES PREVENT THE PIGS FROM TURNING AROUND, LYING DOWN AND FULLY EXTENDED THEIR LIMBS.
Jon:  SO? WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT EXTENDING YOUR LIMBS? ANYWAY, LOOK, I'M DOING IT RIGHT ... OH. OH MY, YEAH, ALL RIGHT. OH. [BLEEP]  I FEEL ALIVE. YEAH. OH MY GOD. I JUST ... THE HILLS ARE ALIVE ♪ WITH THE SOUND OF ♪ I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT TO RUB IT IN BUT THIS EXTENDING YOUR LIMBS THING IS PRETTY SWEET. [LAUGHTER] AND ANYWAY, THESE ARE JUST GESTATIONAL CRATES. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT I'M SURE ONCE THEY GIVE BIRTH THEY GET MATERNITY LEAVE. AND YOU KNOW PROBABLY BACK TO NORMAL WITH LOTS OF MOVING AROUND.
BREEDING PIGS SPEND 80% OF THEIR LIVES PREGNANT AND SO THEY SPEND THE BULK OF THEIR LIVES IN THESE CRATES.
Jon:  JEEPS [BLEEP] CHRIST. THAT IS HORRIBLE. THESE POOR PIGS TORTURED FOR LIFE. AND FOR WHAT? OH. [LAUGHTER] ALL RIGHT. IT'S A COMPELLING ARGUMENT. BUT ALL RIGHT. CHRISTIE'S GOT TO DECIDE BECAUSE RECENTLY THE NEW JERSEY STATE LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED A BILL BANNING THE USE OF THESE GESTATION CRATES AND IT'S A BAN THAT'S SUPPORTED BY 93% OF NEW JERSEY VOTERS. I MEAN, THE ONLY THING. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD MAKE APPROVING THIS BILL MORE OF A NO BRAINER FOR CHRISTIE IS IF HE GOT A MESSAGE FROM A MAGICALLY LITERATE SPIDER ABOUT IT.
CHRISTIE REPORTEDLY TOLD A GROUP OF IOWA PORK PRODUCERS HE WILL VETO THE NEW JERSEY BILL. WHAT? WELL, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY I GUESS YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE CITIZENS OF IOWA WHO ELECTED YOU GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY. [LAUGHTER] WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
PIG FARMING ISN'T BIG IN NEW JERSEY BUT IT IS HUGE IN IOWA WHICH IS HOME FOR THE FIRST ELECTION CAUCUSES.
IOWA IS THE NUMBER ONE PORK PRODUCING STATE IN THE COUNTRY. NEW JERSEY HAS 9,000 PIGS. IOWA IS 20 MILLION.
Jon:  NEXT MOVIE IDEA. [LAUGHTER] IOWA BASED SCI-FI THRILLER "RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE PIGS." [LAUGHTER] THIS SUMMER. GO HOG WILD AND SAVE YOUR BACON. [APPLAUSE] THAT REALLY LOOKS LIKE AN ANGRY [BLEEP] PIG RIGHT THERE. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. PURELY TO ADVANCE HIS PERSONAL POLITICAL GOALS, CHRIS CHRISTIE'S GOING TO VETO A BILL ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY. WHICH IS WEIRD CONSIDERING THE KIND OF GUY CHRIS CHRISTIE ALWAYS SAYS HE IS.
MY JOB IS TO STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY AND TO FIGHT FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO REGARDLESS OF THE POLITICS.  WHAT THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY WANT IS PEOPLE WHO COME INTO OFFICE AND DO THEIR JOBS AND IF YOU TRY TO CALCULATE EVERY ONE OF THESE MOVES POLITICALLY, YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB. I ALWAYS PUT THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY AND MY OATH AHEAD OF PETTY PERSONAL POLITICS.
Jon:  OF COURSE THE OBVIOUS EXCEPTIONS OF BRIDGES AND PIGS. [BLEEP] THEM. SO, NOW I GUESS WE KNOW GOVERNOR CHRISTIE'S PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION IS THE ONE THING HE WON'T PUT IN A TINY CRATE. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THERE'S A DEEPER ISSUE WHO ARE. WE'RE GOING TO EXPLORE THE PROS AND CONS OF GESTATION CRATES WITH NEWEST DAILY SHOW CORRESPONDENT HASAN MINHAJ REPRESENTING TEAM TURN AROUND AND RELATIVELY SENIOR CORRESPONDENT JORDAN KLEPPER FROM --
TEAM ONE DIRECTION.
Jon:  REALLY? ONE DIRECTION. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S THE NAME YOU WANT TO --
YEAH. JON, CLEARLY I'M ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS PIG THING. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TEENAGE GIRLS HIGH FIVED ME ON THE WAY TO WORK? NICE.
Jon: ALRIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO START WITH YOU, HASAN. HASAN, FIRST OF ALL WELCOME TO THE SHOW. WE'RE AWFULLY EXCITED TO HAVE YOU. [APPLAUSE] LET ME ASK YOU FIRST. WHY ARE YOU AGAINST THE USE OF GESTATION CRATES?
THANK YOU, JON. YOU KNOW, JON, FARM ANIMALS GIVE THEIR LIVES TO GIVE US SUSTENANCE. AND IN RETURN DO WE NOT OWE IT TO THEM TO MAKE THEIR TIME ON EARTH HOWEVER BRIEF IT IS AS DIGNIFIED AS POSSIBLE. FOR WHEN WE BRUTALIZE THE HELPLESS CREATURES WHO DEPEND ON US AREN'T WE BRUTALIZING OUR OWN SOULS?
Jon:  OH MY GOD, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH, HASAN. YOUR TURN, JORDAN.
I DON'T THINK PIGS SHOULD TURN AROUND. [LAUGHTER]  I DON'T LIKE IT.
Jon:  DO YOU WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT?
A BIT MORE?SURE, JON. THEY SHOULD BE FACING FORWARD. MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T MOVE. PIGS ARE FINE CLAMPED RIGHT IN THERE.
Jon:  HASAN.
IS THIS HOW THE DEBATES USUALLY GO?
Jon: I DON'T, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S MY FIRST DAY. [BLEEP]. OKAY. OKAY, LET'S SEE. I HAVE, I'VE GOT BIBLE VERSE HERE. I'VE GOT POETRY FROM COLLEGE. OKAY. OKAY, HERE WE GO.
YOU KNOW, I GOT ONE.
NO, NO. THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER IMMANUEL KANT.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT I GOT. WHEN I EAT BACON I WANT TO KNOW IT'S BEEN FACING FORWARD. THAT'S WHERE THE FLAVOR COMES FROM.
Jon: REALLY? YOU CAN TASTE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PORK RAISED IN CRATES WHERE THEY CAN'T MOVE AND PORK RAISED MORE HUMANELY. YOU CAN TASTE THAT?
OKAY, PROBABLY NOT. I JUST DON'T LIKE PIGS FACING DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THEY SHOULDN'T MOVE.  IT'S A GUT THING.  [LAUGHTER]
Jon:  FINAL THOUGHTS HASAN.
I DON'T EVEN, OKAY. I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT HISTORY WILL JUDGE US BY HOW WE TREAT THE CREATURES WHO SERVE US.
Jon:  THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. JORDAN, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO CLOSE WITH? [APPLAUSE] NO, THAT'S NICE, THAT'S NICE. JORDAN, WHY DON'T YOU TRY ONE?
PIGS SHOULDN'T TURN AROUND. IT'S LIKE FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. EYES FRONT, CLOGGED HEARTS, CAN'T MOVE.
Jon:  HASAN MINHAJ AND JORDAN KLEPPER EVERYBODY. [APPLAUSE]
