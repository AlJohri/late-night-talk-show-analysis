FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT WE'RE VERY EXCITED SAUDI FILMMAKER HAIFAA AL MANSOUR WILL BE ON THE SHOW. SHE'S DONE THIS FILM WAJADA. TREMENDOUS. OFF THE TOP YOU MAY RECALL IF YOU'VE SEEN OUR PROGRAM LAST WEEK WE HAD A LITTLE SPIRITED FUN WITH MEGYN KELLY. WE'RE REALLY SCAMPS. HER RESPONSE TO SANTA BEING A COLOR OTHER THAN WHITE.
KIDS AT HOME SANTA IS WHITE. WE'RE JUST DEBATING THIS BECAUSE SOMEONE WROTE ABOUT IT.
Jon: SEE. [ LAUGHTER ] LIKE MOST DEBATES IT STARTED BY GIVING YOU THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER FIRST. NOW, UNFORTUNATELY FOR MISS KELLY FOR FOX HER PROGRAM IS TELEVISED. AND PEOPLE WHO SAW THE SEGMENT OR READ ABOUT IT EXPRESSED AN OPINION THAT WHAT SHE SAID WAS WRONG AND DEFENSIVE AND ODDLY DEFINITIVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF A FICTIONAL CHARACTER AND (bleep)ED. PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE REALLY (bleep)ED UP. THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE ECONOMISTS TAKE ON IT. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT ON FRIDAY MISS KELLY TOOK TO THE AIRWAVES TO CLEAR THINGS UP.
IN KICKING OFF A LIGHT HEARTED SEGMENT I OFFERED A TONGUE IN CHEEK MESSAGE FOR ANY KIDS WATCHING SAYING THAT SANTA, WHO I JOKED IS A REAL PERSON WHOSE RACE IS IDENTIFIABLE IS WHITE. AN OFFHAND JEST IS NOW A NATIONAL FIRESTORM. HUMOR IS SOMETHING WE TRY TO BRING TO THE SHOW BUT SOMETIME IT'S LOST ON THE HUMORLESS AND FOX NEWS AND YOURS TRULY ARE BIG TARGETS FOR MANY PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: I GUESS WE ALL OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT APPEARED TO ME TO BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A FOX NEWS SEGMENT EXPRESSING ANGER AND VICTIMIZATION OVER THE LOSS OF ABSOLUTE POWER AND REFRAMING THAT AS PERSECUTION OF REAL THAT AMERICA BY MINORITIES, FREELOADERS AND SOCIALISTS -- [LAUGHTER] -- THAT IS TRADEMARKED, BY THE WAY. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THAT WAS ACTUALLY A JEST, A JAPE. I'M SURE IF WE LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL CLIP AGAIN IN THAT CONTEXT WE'LL FIND IT AS HUMOROUS AS IT WAS SINCERELY INTENDED TO BE.
FOR ALL YOU KIDS WATCHING AT HOME, SANTA JUST IS WHITE. JESUS WAS A WHITE MAN, TOO. JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO CHANGE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, I GET IT. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: OH, I GET IT. [LAUGHTER] OUR TOP STORY TONIGHT. LIKE MOST AMERICANS I LIVE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF FEAR. IS MY CELL PHONE GIVING ME CANCER? IS MY COFFEE SWEETENER GIVING ME CCANCER? IS GOD GOING TO PUNISH ME BY BEING SO AFRAID OF CANCER BY GIVING ME CANCER BUT ACCORDING TO NEWS REPORTS WE HAVE MORE THAN CANCER TO WORRY ABOUT.
CAN YOU IMAGINE WALKING DOWN THE STREET MINDING YOUR OWN BUSINESS WHEN SOMEONE PUNCHES YOU IN THE FACE FOR NO REASON AT ALL?
Jon: WELL, I DID GO TO HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY SO YES. I CAN ALSO IMAGINE GETTING A LUGI HOCKED INTO MY HAIR AND BEING CALLED A HOMO BY A GIRL I JUST ASKED TO THE PROM.
IT'S CALLED THE KNOCKOUT GAME. TEENAGERS KNOCKING PEOPLE OUT FOR THE FUN OF IT.
Jon: THAT IS THE KEY BECAUSE IF THEY WERE COLD  COCKING PEOPLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WE WOULD BE COOL WITH THAT HOW BAD IS THIS GAME?
INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED IN TEN STATES COAST TO COAST.
IT'S BEEN SPREADING WITH CASES FROM SAN DIEGO, ST. LOUIS AND CHICAGO.
CACES ARE PILING UP AND POLICE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ON HIGH ALERT I KNOW POLICE ARE NOT LOOKING TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ASSAULTING EACH OTHER AND THIS NEW TREND HAS GIVEN THEM REASON TO BE VIGILANT. KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED A LOT OF PUNCHING GONE ON OUT THERE. POLICE HAVE TO BE ALL OVER THIS STRAIN OF CHRONIC CONNECTED VIOLENCE AND PROBABLY CALLED IN THE BIG GUNS, THE PROFILERS, YOUR CLOSERS, YOUR MENTALISTS YOUR NCISES, YOUR CSIS, YOUR CLOSERS, YOUR MENTALISTS YOUR NCISES, YOUR CSIS, HAWAII, BONES, ELEMENTARIES, YOUR BLOODS BLUE, THE POINT IS THERE ARE SO MANY (bleep) COP SHOWS ON TELEVISION THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS TREND. THERE'S EVIDENCE IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE 1994.
EVEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" TIMES IS REPORTING. POLICE OFFICIALS IN SEVERAL CITIES WHERE ATTACKS HAPPENED SAID THAT THE GAME AMOUNTED TO LITTLE MORE THAN AN URBAN MYTH.
Jon: COULD THE NEWS MEDIA BE OVERHYPING THE DANGER? THEY'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE WAS THAT ALL THE TIME.
FEARS ESCALATING ACROSS THE COUNTRY TONIGHT AS FLASH  MOBS ON THE RISE IN RECENT WEEKS.
IT'S WHEN A GROUP OF YOUNG THIEVES PLOT TO --
DANGEROUS TREND CAR SURFING.
DISTURBING SELFY PICTURES.
LOTS OF KIDS VIDEO TAPING THEMSELVES PERFORMING DANGEROUS STUNTS.
DISTURBING NEW TREND, NOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BITING EACH OTHER FOR REAL.
QUESTION INNOCENT FUN OR  SEXUAL HARASSMENT? YOUNG STUDENTS SLAPPING THE BACK SIDES OF OTHERS. [ LAUGHTER ] IF THIS NEW BITING TREND EVER COMBINES WITH THIS NEW BACKSIDE TREND, YOUNG PEOPLE WILL HAVE TURNED INTO MY AUNT. [ LAUGHTER ] GIVE ME THAT TUSHIE. COME HERE. [LAUGHTER] MY AUNT USED TO BITE MY TUSHIE. [ LAUGHTER ] A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. [LAUGHTER] CAILT SENSATIONALISM IF YOU WANT BUT ALL THE KNOCKOUT HYPE HAS LED TO A CALL FOR ACTION.
A NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATOR IS DRAFTING UP A NEW BILL TO UP THE PENALTY FOR THESE CRIMES. A 25 YEAR SENTENCE IS BEING PROPOSED FOR TEENS 14 AND UP WHO PLAYED THE GAME OR EVEN STAND BY AND WATCH. JOINING US NOW IS THE MAN BEHIND THE PLAN NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLYMAN.
THEY ARE BEATING THEIR CHEST. ACTING LIKE BIG MEN. BIG MEN SHOULD HAVE A BIG LAW AND PENALTY IF THEY DO THIS TYPE OF DASTARDLY CRIME.
Jon: (bleep) 25 YEARS FOR JUST STANDING THERE. THE THING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE A THING NEEDS MORE ONEROUS PENALTIES THAN WHAT ALREADY EXISTS FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. DON'T WE HAVE ANOTHER VIOLENCE ISSUE EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD AND DAMAGING?
AMERICA HAS MORE GUN DEATHS THAN ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD.
SINCE NEWTOWN AT LEAST 173 CHILDREN UNDER 12 HAVE DIED FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS.
IT'S ANOTHER WEEK OF GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA, 170 SHOOTING DEATHS REPORTED NATIONWIDE.
Jon: 170 IN A WEEK. YET, AS A MATTER OF FACT SINCE NEWTOWN GUN LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE GOTTEN WEAKER NOT STRONGER. THAT SEEMS -- I'VE GOT IT. [LAUGHTER] THERE'S A NEW TREND SWEEPING THIS COUNTRY. [ LAUGHTER ] PEOPLE SHOOTING OTHER PEOPLE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S CALLED THE SHOOTY GAME. [ LAUGHTER ] (bleep) IT WILL NEVER WORK. [ LAUGHTER ] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
