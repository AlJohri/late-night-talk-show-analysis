SHOW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS THE RECENT TRAGIC EVENTS IN ARIZONA SHOW US, A SCOURGE OF VIOLENCE IS STILL VERY MUCH WITH  THIS COUNTRY. IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE NO QUICK FIXES UNLESS THERE ARE.
AT LEAST FIVE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE NOW PLANNING TO INTRODUCE NEW GUN LEGISLATION. AMONG THEM NEW YORK REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN PETER KING WHO SAID TODAY HE WILL INTRODUCE A BILL  THAT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO BRING A GUN WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: TWO QUESTIONS:  A, CAN YOU REST OF US GET US ONE OF THOSE 1,000 FEET GUN PERIMETERS  AND HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED TO WORK EXACTLY. HOW WOULD LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS KNOW HOW FAR THEY ARE FROM GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS UNLESS THE  STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO WEAR COW BELLS AND GUN OWNERS TO CARRY NFL YARDAGE CHAINS. THE QUESTION IS THIS THOUGH:  SHOULD WE REALLY BE WRITING LAWS THAT MAY BUMP UP AGAINST THE  SECOND AMENDMENT WITHOUT AT LEAST FIRST CONSIDERING LAWS THAT COULD BUMP UP AGAINST THE  FIRST AMENDMENT?
THE FIRST REAL INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY REPRESENTATIVE BRADY OF PENNSYLVANIA. HE'S GOING CONTINUE TO TROA DEUCE LEGISLATION SAYING IT MAKES IT A FEDERAL CRIME TO USE  LANGUAGE OR SIGNALS USED AS INCITING VIOLENCE AGAINST A THREATENING FIGURE OR A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.
Jon: ISN'T THREATENING A FEDERAL OFFICIAL OR MEMBER OF CONGRESS ALREADY AGAINST THE LAW? [LAUGHTER] HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?
WE'RE ADDING SYMBOLS. YOU CAN'T PUT A ACROSSHAIR -- A CROSSHAIR OR A BULL'S EYE ON A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR A DISTRICT.
Jon: YOU CAN'T PUT CROSSHAIRS ON A DISTRICT. YOU ARE WRITING A NEW FEDERAL LAW JUST TO SAY (bleep) YOU TO SARAH PALIN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OR IS PERHAPS SAYING (bleep) YOU TO SARAH PALIN ALSO NOW ILLEGAL AGAINST THE STATUTE. WE'RE UP AGAINST THE AGE-OLD DILEMMA A FREE PEOPLE MUST FACE. MOST OF US DO NOT NEED CLARIFICATION ON THE WHOLE THOU SHALL NOT KILL THING AND FOR  THOSE WHO DO CLARIFICATION NEVER SEEMS SPECIFIC ENOUGH. ONE SHALL NOT KILL. WHAT ABOUT ABOUT KNIVES? YOU CAN'T KILL PEOPLE WITH KNIVES. I SEE, I SEE. ARE MINORITIES MINORITIES ARE INCLUDED? WHAT IF I GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT? CAN I GO UP TO SOMEBODY AND SAY I WANT TO YOU? CAN I DO THAT? WE ENFORCE ENFORCING LAW AND FORCING EVERYONE TO LIVE BY RULES THAT ONLY ATTEMPT TO  PREVENT THE LAST THING THAT WAS DONE BY THE LEAST CONTROLLABLE AMONGST US. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. WE MUST NOT GIVE IN TO FEAR SM WE MUST EMPOWER OUR BETTER JUDGEMENT TO CREATE A SOCIETY  WHERE VIOLENT RHETORIC AND IMAGERY IS FROWNED UPON NOT BECAUSE IT DRIVES THE UNSTABLE  TO ACTION BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S WRONG ITSELF. I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE REACT.
MONDAY AFTER THE SHOOTING HANDGUNS SALES JUMPED 60% IN ARIZONA COMPARED TO THE SAME DAY  A YEAR AGO. ONE GUN SHOP OWNER TOLD BLOOMBERG NEWS HIS GLOCK SALES DOUBLED THIS WEEK.
Jon: OR WE COULD GO THE OTHER WAY. WE'LL BE RI
