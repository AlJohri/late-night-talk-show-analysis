(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT AN AUTHOR. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED THE RIPPLE EFFECT. THE FATE OF FRESH WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW ALEX PRUD'HOMME. NICE TO SEE YOU. HOW ARE YOU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
MY PLEASURE.
Jon: WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A FINE TIME TONIGHT. WE SHARED MANY LAUGHS AND NOW A WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL US HOW THE HUMAN RACE WILL END.
IT IS THE RIP REL EFFECT, THE FATE OF FRESH WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY. THE FATE OF FRESH WATER IN THE 21st CENTURY, SIR, ACCORDING TO YOUR BOOK, IT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD.
NO. BETWEEN DROUGHT, FLOOD AND SELF-POISONING, I THINK THE HUMAN RACE IS IN FOR A TOUGH TIME WATERWISE.
Jon: .
Jon: AND THE BAD NEWS?
NO ONE IS PAYING ATTENTION. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
Jon: THIS IS NOT HORDING, I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE, YOU MAY. BUT FOR NOW, TO BE SAFE. WHAT IS THE GREATEST THREAT, IS IT THAT WE ARE POLLUTING OUR OWN OR THAT WE ARE OVERPOPULATING WHAT EXISTS?
ALL OF THE ABOVE. NO, HERE'S THE THING. 40 YEARS AFTER THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, THE FOUNDING OF  THE EPA, THE FACT IS THAT OUR WATER IS ACTUALLY GETTING DIRTIER RATHER THAN CLEANER. AND REGULATIONS AREN'T KEEPING UP WITH NEW TYPES OF POLLUTANTS. THE EPA IS UNDER ATTACK IN CONGRESS. AND POLLUTERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
Jon: BUT COULDN'T YOU SAY THEN IN THE 50s AND 670s THEY WOULD SAY WELL, LOOK AT  OUR WATERS, YOU CAN LIGHT THEM ON FIRE. THERE ARE CAR SEN GENICS IN THERE AND WE DID SOMETHING. WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT WE WON'T-- CLEAN SOME OF THESE NEW POLLUTANTS OUT AND  WHAT ARE THEY. AND MAYBE WE DISCOVER THAT THEY ACTUALLY CURE CANCER?
WHERE DO I BEGIN, JON. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: START WITH ALL THE THINGS I GOT WRONG.
WELL, THE REASON FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT OF THE LATE 60s AND EARLY 70s  WAS BECAUSE THE CUYAHOGA RIVER IGNITED ON FIRE BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY POLLUTANTS IN IT AND THE  POISONING AT LOVE CANAL AND THAT WAS AN IMPETUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. AND THERE WERE SOME WONDERFUL REGULATIONS AND LAWS PUT INTO EFFECT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT BEING AMERICANS WE SAID OKAY, DONE THAT. FINISHED. WE'RE OUT OF THERE. AND THAT WAS 40 YEARS AGO. AND WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT ACTUALLY CHEMICAL COMPANIES KEEP PRODUCING NEW CHEMICALS EVERY YEAR. PEOPLE FIND SNEAKY WAYS OF GETTING COW MANURE INTO OUR WELLS.
Jon: THAT SEEMS VERY SPECIFIC.
YEAH.
Jon: LIKE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHEMICALS AN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE PUTTING COW  POOP IN OUR WELLS.
READ THE BOOK, JON. YES. AND SO WE HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE POLLUTANTS. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS.
Jon: JUST IN AMERICA OR A WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT A WORLDWIDE  PHENOMENON, CAN'T WE ATTACK OTHER COUNTRIES WHOSE WATER IS CLEANER AND DRINK THEIR  MILK SHAKE, AS IT WERE?
LIKE DANIEL PLAINVIEW.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING.
IT IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM. AND THERE ARE LEGACY POLLUTANTS WHICH ARE THE OLD POLLUTANTS SITTING IN THE  ENVIRONMENT FOR DECADES SUCH AS PCPs IN THE HUDSON RIVER DOWN THE STREET. AND THEN THERE ARE NEW POLLUTANTS LIKE SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN AND NARCOTICS. AND-- THE 600 NEW CHEMICALS THAT COME OUT EVERY YEAR.
Jon: IF SEEMS LIKE SUCH A DIFFERENT LIKE OH MY GOD WE'RE GOING TO BE TRIPPING  AND WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL IF WE ARE TRIPPING AND WE ALL HAVE BREASTS OR IF IT IS  JUST, YOU KNOW --
MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING.
Jon: MAYBE IT'S A GOOD THING. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO TURN NONPOTABLE SOURCES INTO  POTABLE SOURCES, SEAWATER, WASTE, HUMAN SEWAGE?
YES, INDEED. WE'VE STARTED THAT. DESAL INATION IS THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE SALT OUT OF SEAWATER. THE PROBLEM WITH W IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO. IT REQUIRES A LOT OF POWER. WHICH CREATES MORE GREENHOUSE GASES. YOU TAKE THE SALT OUT AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE SALT? THEY'RE VERY CONCENTRATED. WHEN YOU PUT THEM BACK INTO THE OCEAN WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE LIKE TO DO, IT KILLS  SOME OF THE MARINE LIFE. SO DESAL IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX BUT IT'S NOT THE ANSWER. RECYCLING SEWAGE IS ACTUALLY A VERY INTERESTING IDEA. IT STARTED TO HAPPEN MORE AND MORE NOW. THERE IS OBVIOUS REACTION TO THIS A YUCK FACTOR THAT PEOPLE CAN'T STAND-- .
Jon: REALLY, DRINKING OUR EVEN URINE.
SHOCKING.
Jon: YOU GET A YUCK FACTOR ON THAT ONE.
A LITTLE BIT, LITTLE BIT. BUT IN ORANGE COUNTY THEY BUILT A GIANT NEW PLANT THAT IS PRODUCING ULTRA PURE WATER. WHICH THEY THEN PUT BACK IN AND MIX WITH NATURAL SUPPLIES. AND EVENTUALLY ENDS UP IN, OVER 2 MILLION TAPS. AND SO FAR NO PROBLEMS. AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO.
Jon: YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE-- I'M NEVER MOVING THERE.
YEAH.
Jon: WELL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ANYBODY AT HOME, IF ARE YOU HAVING A PARTY AND YOU WANT TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD, GET THE RIPPLE EFFECT. INVITE THEM OVERMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. ALEX PRUD'HOMME. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
