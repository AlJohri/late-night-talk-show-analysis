FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW". WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT ONE OF OUR FAVORITES SAMUEL L. JACKSON. WE'RE EXCITED TO HAVE HIM BACK ON THE PROGRAM. THIS IS GONNA BE FUN. BUT I WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN. YOU MAY RECALL, YOU PROBABLY WON'T, WE DIDN'T. DECEMBER 2013, GENERAL MOTORS ONE OF AMERICA'S OLDEST MOST OFTEN BANKRUPTED AUTO MAKERS MADE AN HISTORIC MOVE.
THEY NAMED A WOMAN AS ITS NEXT CEO. HER NAME IS MARY BARRA.
WE HAVE A NEW CEO WHO HAPPENS TO BE A WOMAN, A CAR GAL.
Jon: A CAR GAL, AN AUTO DAME, A JALOPY BROAD. [ LAUGHTER ] NEVER HAS AN OUTGOING CEO PROMOTED CHANGE WHILE SO PERFECTLY DEMONSTRATINGING SO MUCH FURTHER THEY STILL HAVE TO GO. BUT FOR THIS HORSELESS CARRIAGED TOMATO, ITS LOOKED LIKE NOTHING BUT OPEN ROAD.
WE HAVE A WARNING FOR YOU TONIGHT. GM IS RECALLING NEARLY 780,000 OLDER MODEL COMPACT CARS. THE CARS IN QUESTION CHEVROLET COBALT AND PONTIAC G5'S.
Jon: IT'S A LITTLE SPEED BUMP; IT'S A RECALL. HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. WHAT ARE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT OVERGLUED DECALS? VANITY LIGHT BULB BRIGHTNESS  ISSUE? OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE THE ACTUAL DISTANCE AWAY THAT THEY APPEAR TO BE? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
GM ADMITTED THE IGNITION SWITCH ON MORE THAT TWO MILLION VEHICLES MAY SUDDENLY MOVE TO THE OFF OR ACCESSORY POSITION SHUTTING OFF THE ENGINE, DISABLINGING POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKES, THE SEATBELTS AND THE AIRBAGS. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OH, OR THAT. I GUESS. OR FOR NO REASON YOUR CAR MAY INSTANTLY TRANSFORM INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE 2500 POUND POWER DEAD, METALLIC BLUE CANNON BALL, SATELLITE RADIO OPTIONAL. ALRIGHT, THEY LEARNED THE PROBLEM AND IMMEDIATELY MOVED FOR A RECALL. SYSTEM WORKED.
GM FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM IN 2001.
Jon: RIGHT 2001. THEY NOTICED THE PROBLEM IN 2001 BUT YOU HAVE TO APPROACH THESE THINGS WITH CAUTION. YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.
IT'S WHAT IS CALLED A DETENT PLUNGER. THIS TINY PART IN THE RECALLED VEHICLES WAS TOO SHORT AND COULD SLIP MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR THE IGNITION TO SHIFT WHILE DRIVING.
Jon: SAVE THE PLUNGER, SAVE THE WORLD. [LAUGHTER]
IN MARCH 2005 A GM REPORT SAID FIXES WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND COST TOO MUCH. QUOTE" NONE OF THE SOLUTIONS REPRESENTS AN ACCEPTABLE BUSINESS CASE."
Jon: OH. THEY FOUND OUT IN 2001, STUDIED THE PROBLEM FOR FOUR YEARS, DID AN INTERNAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS USING YOUR STANDARD ANALYTIC BAROMETRIC PE RATIO EQUATIONS AND CAME UP WITH (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] COSTS TOO MUCH. OUT OF CURIOSITY, THOUGH LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. HOW MUCH DID IT COST?
THE COST OF REPLACEMENT, THE PART WOULD HAVE BEEN 57 CENTS.
Jon: WELL, HOLD ON. WHEN YOU ADD IT UP -- IT'S STILL A TINY AMOUNT OF MONEY ACTUALLY. FOR GOD SAKES EVEN IF YOU ARE STRAPPED FOR CASH, GM YOU COULD HAVE FOUND AT LEAST THAT MUCH IN THE SEATS OF CARS YOU ARE FIXING. THE THING WOULD HAVE PAID FOR ITSELF BUT ALL RIGHT. YOU DECIDED IT COST TOO MUCH AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION WOULD -- WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION?
GM SAYS IT KNOWS OF 13 DEATHS AND 32 CRASHES CONNECTED TO ITS FAULTY IGNITION SWITCHES AND AIRBAGS THAT THEN FAILED TO DEPLOY, BUT CONSUMER ADVOCATES SAY THERE MAY BE MANY MORE.
Jon: MOTHER (bleep). [ LAUGHTER ] AND INSTEAD OF FIXING THE PROBLEM, WHAT IS THE SOLUTION YOU OFFERED CUSTOMERS?
INSTEAD GM SENT OUT A SERVICE BULLETIN TO ITS DEALERSHIPS WARNING DRIVERS NOT TO USE HEAVY KEYCHAINS. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: RIGHT, NO, WHY FIX A PROBLEM YOU CREATED WHEN YOU COULD JUST ASK YOUR SURVIVING CUSTOMERS -- [LAUGHTER] -- TO GET RID OF ALL THEIR OTHER KEYS. HEY, HERE IS YOUR PROBLEM HERE, WITH THE -- HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR HERE, YOU HAVE A HOUSE. [LAUGHTER] YOU SELL THAT AND ANY OTHER LOCKED DEVICES AND YOUR CAR SHOULD RUN NO PROBLEM. [ LAUGHTER ] GM HAS KNOWN FOR OVER A DECADE ABOUT A DEADLY DESIGN FLAW, WAITED YEARS TO ATTEMPT TO FIX IT. BOTCHED THE FIX. THREATENED TO RECOOP LEGAL COSTS FROM ANYBODY WHO TRIED TO LITIGATE THE ISSUE AND WHEN THE (bleep) HIT THE FAN DECIDED MAYBE IT'S TIME TO PROMOTE CAR GAL AND SO ON JANURY 15, 2014 MARY BARRA TOOK OVER GM AND WAS SOON THERE AFTER MEANINGING YESTERDAY OFFERED AN ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP TO WASHINGTON'S ROMANTIC HOUSE HEARING ROOM.
THIS IGNITION SWITCH ISSUE WAS FIRST -- CAME TO LIGHT IN 2006, IS THAT CORRECT?
IT CAME TO LIGHT TO ME ON JANUARY 31, 2014.
Jon: HOLY (bleep). THEY HIRED HER AND THEN TOLD HER DURING HER ORIENTATION. [LAUGHTER] WELCOME MS. BARRA YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS PLACE. THERE'S YOUR DESK OVER THERE, THERE'RE SOME BUSINESS CARDS, STATIONARY SUPPLIES, OBVIOUSLY IN THE CLOSET IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE ANYTHING IN THE BREAK ROOM FRIDGE YOU'RE GONNA WRITE YOUR NAME ON IT. THAT'S EVERYTHING I THINK. OH, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EASILY AVOIDABLE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 13 PEOPLE. AND THE LADIES ROOM IS DOWN THE HALL. OKAY. SO HOW DID CEO BARRA HANDLE IT?
AS SOON AS I LEARNED ABOUT THE PROBLEM WE ACTED WITHOUT HESITATION. WE'LL NOT SHIRK FROM OUR RESPONSIBILITIES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. TODAY'S GM WILL DO THE RIGHT THING.
Jon: TODAY'S GM IS NOT A SHIRKER. [ LAUGHTER ] AND IN FACT, THEY HIRED A LAWYER THAT SPECIALIZES IN CASES WHERE VICTIMS ARE COMPENSATED SO THEY PROBABLY HAVE A GREAT PLAN TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE HIRING OF MR. FEINBERG INDICATES THAT GM WILL GIVE SOME KIND OF SETTLEMENT?
IT WILL TAKE PROBABLY 30-60 DAYS TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION. WE'VE NOT MADE ANY DECISIONS. WE'VE JUST STARTED THIS PROCESS WITH MR. FEINBERG.
AND THAT MIGHT INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED AS WELL.
WE'VE NOT MADE ANY DECISIONS.
Jon: WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY. MAYBE OUR LAWYER WILL RECOMMEND WE JUST DANGLE MONEY IN FRONT OF PEOPLE WITHOUT GIVE THEM ANY OR MAYBE THE FAMILIES OWE US MONEY. WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. AND THIS IS WHERE OUR UP TO NOW PLEASANT CRUISE OF A STORY ENCOUNTERS AN UNEXPECTED CATOSTROPHIC TECHNICAL PROBLEM AND CAREENS INTO A DITCH. WHY WOULD GM HAVE THE ABILITY TO IN ANY WAY WAIT AND SEE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT SETTLING THESE CASES WITH THESE CLEARLY WRONGED FAMILIES? HOW ARE THEY NOT AUTOMATICALLY LIABLE FOR DAMAGES?
UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EMERGENCE FROM FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN 2009 THE NEW GENERAL MOTORS IS NOT LIABLE FOR CLAIMS FROM ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE JULY OF THAT YEAR.
Jon: TADA. AND ONCE AGAIN WE LEARNED THAT NOT ONLY ARE CORPORATIONS PEOPLE THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF WEIRD MUTANT POWER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DODGE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS. BECAUSE GM DECLARED BANKRUPTCY THEY ARE NO LONGER LEGALLY LIABLE FOR HUMAN DEATHS THAT THEY CAUSED THROUGH THEIR ADMITTED NEGLIGENCE. I CANNOT WAIT FOR A NONCORPORATE PERSON TO TRY THAT (bleep). NO, NO, YOUR HONOR, MY NAME IS NOT JEFFREY DAHMER. JEFFREY DAHMER DECLARED MORAL BANKRUPTCY A FEW YEARS BACK. WHILE I DEEPLY REGRET THE OLD JEFFREY DAHMER'S ACTIONS. I, JOFF DAMER AM NOT ON THE HOOK IN ANY WAY LEGALLY FOR THE ADMITTED EATING OF SOME OF MY NEIGHBORS, I MEAN, HIS NEIGHBORS. SO I'M JUST GOING TO HEAD OUT, GET IN MY CAR AND DRIVE AWAY. IT'S A FORD I'M NOT A MANIAC. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
