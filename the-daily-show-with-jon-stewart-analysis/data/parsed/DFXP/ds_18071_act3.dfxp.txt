Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM. WE'RE TALKING WITH FORMER  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SANDRA DAY  O'CONNOR. YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING TO ME --  WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE  SUPREME COURT AND THEY SEEM PROTECTIVE OVER THE PROCESS AND  YOU WERE SAYING ONE OF REASONS  YOU THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE.
THE SUPREME COURT IS THE ONE  BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT HAS  WRITTEN EXPLANATIONS FOR EVERYTHING IT DECIDES AND Z. THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIONIVE. NO MEMBER OF CONGRESS HAS TO  WRITE AN WRITTEN EXPLANATION OF  EVERYTHING.
Jon: SUCH A GOOD POINT.
YES, NOT BAD.
Jon: BUT IT IS. IN THE LEGISLATURE -- THINGS  HAPPEN THAT SEEM INEXPLICABLE ON  THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE.
RIGHT.
Jon: OR THE EXECUTIVE SIDE  AND NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW IT  WENT DOWN. IT'S BACKROOM THINGS THAT SHOW  UP AND THEY VOTE ON IT.
BUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE COURT  HAS TO HAVE A WRITTEN  EXPLANATION. YOU CAN JOIN SOMEONE ELSE'S  OPINION AND SAY I AGREE WITH  THAT AND SIGN IT BUT EVERY JUSTICE HAS SIGNED ON TO SOME  EXPLANATION. IT'S IMPRESSIVE, I THINK.
Jon: IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE. IN SOME WAYS THIS, IS GOING TO  SOUND CRAZY, DO THE JUSTICES  AFTER DOING THAT JOB FOR A WHILE FEEL JUDGED.
I THINK DO YOU FEEL JUDGED. YOU FEEL THAT EVERYTHING DO YOU  IS UNDER SCRUTINY. EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY WHO HAS  AN INTEREST IN THEY CAN SEE IT  AND TALK ABOUT.
Jon: ANY IDIOT CAN MAKE FUN  OF IT.
MAKE A JOKE OF IT OR  WHATEVER.
Jon: IT'S NOT FAIR.
HARDLY BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT  WORKS.
Jon: IF I SEE SOMEBODY  DOING IT YOU CAN BE SURE I'LL  STOP THEM AS IT GOES. IS THERE SOMETHING TO -- WHEN  YOU GET TO WRITE THE OPINION AND  PEOPLE SIGN ON, IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS DECIDED IN A  ROOM THEY SAY GRAB THIS ONE. IS IT A DIVISION OF LABOR OR YOU  REALLY HAVE A HANDLE OF IT.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE ASSIGNS  SOMEONE TO WRITE EACH OPINION. AS THE WRITER YOU HOPE TO GET  OTHER JUSTICES TO JOIN YOU. IF THEY DON'T AGREE THEY CAN  DISSENT OR WRITE SEPARATELY OR  SAY A DEGREE WITH SOME OF IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT AND WRITE  SEPARATELY IN THE CASE.
Jon: WAS THERE ANYBODY'S  WRITING ON THE COURT OR IN THE  PAST THAT YOU THOUGHT IT'S MAGNIFICENT WORDSMITHING. I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE BUT I  LOVE THE WRITING.
WHO WERE SOME?
HOLMES WASN'T ALL BAD.
Jon: OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES,  I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS.
THERE WERE LOTS OF WONDERFUL  WRITERS IN THE COURT.
Jon: WAS THE COURT FORMERLY  MORE COLORFUL? DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BECOME MORE  CAUTIOUS IN THEIR OPINIONS? DO YOU THINK USED TO BE MORE  COLORFUL.
I GUESS WITH THE READY  AVAILABILITY OF EVERYTHING  PERHAPS THE JUSTICES ARE SOMEWHAT MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT  WHAT THEY DO BUT NOT MUCH. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUT THERE FOR  PUBLIC SCRUTINY.
Jon: ANY JUSTICE FROM THE  PAST THAT YOU THINK BOY I WOULD  HAVE LOVED TO SERVE WITH THAT  JUSTICE? THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY --
WE HAD A LOT OF GOOD JUSTICES  IN THE PAST.
Jon: ANYBODY THAT YOU  THOUGHT --
YES.
Jon: CAN I NAME THEM? RUTLEDGE? WHO IS RUTLEDGE?
DOESN'T COME TO MIND BUT --
Jon: NEVER CARED FOR  RUTLEDGE. GOTTA WATCH THAT GUY. FRANKFURTER?
AT TIMES.
Jon: DID YOU EVER GO BACK  TO ANY OF YOUR OPINIONS AND  THINK TO YOURSELF --
HOW CAN YOU HAVE SAID THAT I  MIGHT SAY.
Jon: AT ALL.
WE'LL SEE.
Jon: AT THE NEXT JUSTICE  BRUNCH.
LUNCH.
Jon: IT'S NOT A BRUNCH,  ALWAYS A LUNCH.
ALWAYS A LUNCH.
Jon: THIS IS WHAT I LIKE  ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES  VERY, VERY SPECIFICALLY. WILL YOU PLEASE TELL JUSTICE  SCALIA FROM ME, COME SEE ME ON  THE PROGRAM. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE BOOK IS CALLED "OUT OF  ORDER."  LOOK AT US WE GOT YOU OUT ON  TIME AND TO YOUR NEXT  ENGAGEMENT.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.
Jon: OUT OF ORDER IS ON THE  BOOKSHELVES NOW. JUSTICE SANDRA D
