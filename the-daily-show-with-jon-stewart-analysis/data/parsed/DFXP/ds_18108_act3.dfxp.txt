(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK! MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN ACADEMY  AWARD WINNING ACTOR, SCIENCE  CHANNEL "THROUGH THE WORM HOLE" WILL RETURN IN JUNE. AND IN A NEW MOVIE CALLED "NOW  YOU SEE IT."
WHEN A MY SEUGS WAVES HIS  HAND AND SAYS THIS IS WHERE THE  TRICK IS HAPPENING, IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING SOMEWHERE  ELSE. MISDIRECTION, THE BASIC CONCEPTS  OF MAGIC.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY  ROBBED THE BANK.
YOU'RE AN IDIOT IF YOU THINK  THEY ROBBED THE BANK. BUT DON'T MY WORD FOR IT. HOW ABOUT A TRIP TO PARIS? THE TELEPOUR STATION HELMET,  PLEASE.
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY DID  IT OR NOT?
Jon: SHAZAM! PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  PROGRAM MORGAN FREE MAN! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN! THEY LOVE YOU, THEY LOVE YOU.
GOOD GROUP.
Jon: THEY'RE A FINE GROUP. HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING SAY. SO HERE'S THE ASSUMPTION.
YEAH.
Jon: YOU'RE GREAT IN THIS  MOVIE AND IT'S A GOOD MOVIE  BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO CRAP.
YEAH.
Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT I WANT  TO TALK ABOUT. THIS WORM HOLE THING YOU'RE  DOING, THIS SCIENCE SHOW, YOU  HOSTED THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS PRIZE GALA IN GENEVA.
I DID.
Jon: SO THIS IS ALL  PHYSICISTS.
ALL PHYSICISTS. EVEN STEVEN HAWKING WAS THERE.
Jon: STEVEN HAWKING WAS  THERE. DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO SPEND  ANY TIME WITH STEVEN HAWKING?
JUST A LITTLE BIT. HE DOESN'T TALK A LOT. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: BUT IS EVERYTHING THAT  HE TYPES GRAND AND -- DOES HE  FEEL THAT -- LIKE, DO YOU THINK HE FEELS THE PRESSURE LIKE AT A  COCKTAIL PARTY HE COULD NEVER  SAY, LIKE, SO WHAT'S UP? LIKE HE -- HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY  SOMETHING PROFOUND EVERY TIME DO  YOU THINK?
I THINK MAYBE MAYBE TEN, 15  YEARS AGO.
Jon: NOW HE'S --
NOW HE'S COOL. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: JUST HANGING OUT AT A  PARTY.
RIGHT, HE'S -- HE'S USED TO  IT NOW.
Jon: WHAT IS IT LIKE AT A  PHYSICIST'S PARTY? (LAUGHTER)  HOW EARLY DOES IT END?
THEY CAN GO FOR A WHILE. THEY'RE -- THEY'RE AN  INTERESTING GROUP OF PEOPLE  BECAUSE IF YOU ENGAGE THEM IN CONVERSATION THEY'RE -- THEY  THINK YOU'RE SHARP.
Jon: THEY WILL?
OH, YEAH.
Jon: DO YOU UNDERSTAND  CERTAIN CONCEPTS OF PHYSICS THAT  ALLOWS YOU TO CARRY THE  CONVERSATION?
I ABSOLUTELY DO.
Jon: YEAH, I DON'T.
NO, NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND  THINGS LIKE STRING THEORY BUT  MULTIPLE UNIVERSES, I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU'D UNDERSTAND IT, RIGHT? (LAUGHTER)  HERE'S AN EXAMPLE.
Jon: I DON'T THINK I --
WATCH. WATCH. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE. PICTURE A BALLOON.
Jon: I CAN DO THAT.
YOU BLOW UP A BALLOON, THAT'S  THE UNIVERSE. YOU COULD DO THAT ANY NUMBER OF  TIMES.
Jon: YOU JUST BLEW MY MIND. (LAUGHTER)  SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT WITHIN A  UNIVERSE THERE'S SORT OF A  MEMBRANE AROUND EACH ONE AND SO --
THAT'S HOW THEY ARGUE. THEY ARGUE THAT -- SOME OF THEM,  NOT ALL OF THEM BUT DIFFERENT  PHYSICISTS WITH DIFFERENT THEORIES ABOUT WHAT IS, RIGHT? FOR INSTANCE, I ASK, OKAY, SO  YOU SAY THE UNIVERSE IS  EXPANDING I MAINTAIN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPACE AND THE  UNIVERSE. THEY SAID NO, NO, THERE'S ONLY  THE UNIVERSE. BUT HOW CAN THE UNIVERSE BE  EXPANDING? WHAT IS IT EXPANDING INTO? THEY BEGIN WITH THE BALLOON  THING, HOW YOU BLOW UP A  BALLOON. BUT BALLOON IS EXPANDING INTO  SPACE.
Jon: IS THE WHOLE THING  BALLOON ORIENTD? (LAUGHTER)  EVERY QUESTION IS JUST "THINK OF  IT AS A BALLOON ANIMAL."  LIKE EVERYTHING IS BALLOON  ORIENTD?
A LOT.
Jon: A LOT OF BALLOON  STUFF. SO WHEN YOU SEE THE LITTLE GROUP  OF PHYSICISTS HOW MANY TIMES DO  YOU SEE PEOPLE GOING JUST -- PULLING OUT BALLOONS AND BLOWING  STUFF UP? (LAUGHTER)  I FIND THAT VERY INTERESTING  BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE THE EXACT  SAME THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD WHICH IS HOW DO YOU EXPAND --
IF THERE'S NOTHING TO EXPAND  INTO. YOU'RE NOT CREATING -- THEY'RE  TALKING ABOUT THE SINGULARITY. YOU KNOW WHAT SINGULARITY IS?
Jon: ONE.
NOTHING.
Jon: IT'S NOT ONE, NOTHING?
IT'S ZERO.
Jon: BUT NOT ZERO, EMPTY.
EMPTY, NOTHING.
Jon: SO THAT'S THE  SINGULARITY OF THE UNIVERSE.
IT STARTED WITH THE BIG BANG,  RIGHT?
Jon: BEEN THERE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO GET  SOMETHING. THERE'S A SONG LIKE THAT, RAY  CHARLES SINGS IT. YOU CAN'T GET NOTHING FROM  NOTHING. I MEAN YOU CAN'T GET SOMETHING  FROM NOTHING. YOU CAN NOT.
Jon: SO WHAT WAS THERE  BEFORE THE BIG BANG? THEY WOULD SAY SINGULARITY.
THEY WOULD SAY. I DON'T SAY THAT.
Jon: I'D LIKE TO SEE A  BALLOON DO DO THAT.
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE AIR  OUT OF THE BALLOON WHEN IT  COLLAPSES YOU'VE STILL GOT  SOMETHING.
Jon: YES! THE MEMBRANE! WHERE'S THE MEMBRANE?
THAT'S THE SINGULARITY. (LAUGHTER)  SORT OF LIKE WHO'S ON FIRST.
Jon: IF I HAD MET YOU WHEN  WE WERE IN COLLEGE I WOULD GET  MUSHROOMS AND YOU AND I WOULD GO TO A PARK. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU'RE THAT GOOD.
I'M FOR THAT.
Jon: I LOVE THIS STUFF. IT'S TREMENDOUS. WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME TO  TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU WENT TOE  THE HADRON COLLIDER. YOU TOURED IT.
DOWN INTO A DEEP CAVERN DOWN  BELOW GROUND, WAY DOWN, 40 FEET  OR SO, MORE. AND THEY HAVE THIS BIG THING AND  THIS -- AND THEN THERE'S THIS  LONG 17-MILE TUBE AND THEY SHOOT PHOTONS A -T EACH OTHER.
Jon: DID YOU SEE THE GOD  PARTICLE.
THEY HAVEN'T --
Jon: WHEN THEY SEE IT, YOU  SHOULD DO THE VOICEOVER FOR THE  GOD PARTICLE. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME! (LAUGHTER)  THE MOVIE IS CALLED "NOW YOU SEE  ME."  IT WILL BE IN THEATERS ON THE  31st. NEW SEASON OF "THROUGH THE WORM  HOLE" BEGINS JUNE 5 ON THE  SCIENCE CHANNEL. IT'S FASCINATING, MORGAN  FREEMAN.
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, DO. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
