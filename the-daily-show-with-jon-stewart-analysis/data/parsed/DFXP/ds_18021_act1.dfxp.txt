FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE "DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon:  WELCOME TO THE  "DAILY SHOW."  MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN N-WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR  YOU TONIGHT. LAST NIGHT EYE DON'T KNOW IF YOU  KNEW THIS-- WE HAD AN ELECTION  AND TONIGHT ON THIS PROGRAM, THE WINNER OF THAT ELECTION, THE  PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.A., THE  UNITED STATES OF ARITHMETIC, NATE SILVER WILL BE JOINING US  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  IT WAS A BIG NIGHT LAST NIGHT. THE BIG NEWS, OF COURSE,  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA NOT JUST  RE-ELECTED BUT SEEMINGLY GIVEN FRESH BATTERIES.
WE REMAIN MORE THAN A  COLLECTION OF RED STATES AND  BLUE STATES. RY ARE AND FOREVER WILL BE THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TOGETHER, WITH YOUR HELP,  AND GOD'S GRACE, WE WILL  CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY FORWARD. ( LAUGHTER ).
Jon:  SO THAT'S ALL IT  TOOK FOR TO YOU GET BACK IN THE  GROOVE WAS THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT  AGAIN? ( LAUGHTER )  THAT'S ALL IT TOOK? ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  OF COURSE, ON THE OTHER SIDE,  GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY BROKE THE BAD NEWS TO HIS SUPPORTERS  BEFORE RELUCTANTLY BEING ASKED  TO POSE FOR HIS FAMILY'S YEARLY CHRISTMAS CARD. ( LAUGHTER ). THAT IS A GOOD-LOOKING BUNCH. IT'S LIKE THEY-- THE PEOPLE THAT  CAME IN THE FRAMES. ACROSS THE NATION, THE PEOPLE  SPOKE, LEGALIZING GAY MARRIAGE  IN MAINE AND MARYLAND. LEGALIZING MARIJUANA IN  WASHINGTON STATE, AND COLORADO--  ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) GAY MARRIAGE... NOTHING. ( LAUGHTER ). MARIJUANA... BAT ( BLEEP )  CRAZY. THEY ALSO LEGAL IDES DANCING IN  THAT TOWN IN "FOOTLOOSE."  I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE LOOKED THAT UP. WISCONSIN ELECTED TAMMY BALDWIN  THE FIRST OPENLY LESBIAN  SENATOR. SORRY, LINDSAY GRAHAM. YEAH. YOU MISSED THE LINDSAY GRAHAM  JOKE. IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD ONE. ( LAUGHTER ). PERHAPS THE BEST NEWS WAS IN  FLORIDA. AFTER MONTHS OF REPUBLICAN  GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT ATTEMPTING  TO SUPPRESS DEMOCRATIC VOTER TURNOUT, AND ATTEMPTING TO  DECREASE VOTER DISCOMFORT AND MY  FAVORITE INTRODUCING A 10-PAGE NOVELETTE STATE BALLOT TO PEOPLE  WHO COULDN'T HANDLE A ( BLEEP )  ONE-PAGE BALLOT. FLORIDA REMAINS TOO CLOSE TO  CALL. WHAT IS THE GOOD NEWS, YOU SAY? THE ELECTION WAS DECIDE WITHOUT  THEM. ( APPLAUSE )    ( CHEERS )   FOR ONCE, FLORIDA'S CLUSTER  ( BLEEP ) IS IRRELEVANT. IT'S LIKE HEARING GOOD NEWS,  AMERICA. THE TUMOR ON YOUR DONG IS  BENIGN. ( LAUGHTER ). IT'S A JOKE ABOUT... COME ON. WE'RE TIRED! FOR THE MOST PART, THE NEWS  NAEKS ACQUITTED THEMSELVES  NICELY WITH LITTLE OF THE EARLY CALLED CONTROVERSY AND  MALFUNCTIONS OF YEARS PAST,  EXCEPT B.M.N., BULL ( BLEEP ) MOUNTAIN NEWS, WHO WERE CAUGHT  FLAT FOOT BIDE A HISTORIC STORM  DID SPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE JUST DAYS BEFORE, THEY NEVER SAW  COMING.
I THINK MITT ROMNEY IS GOING  TO WIN THE ELECTION.
IT JUST IS A MOMENTUM.
I THINK THAT MITT ROMNEY WILL  WIN.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN BY A  LANDSLIDE.
THEY'RE SCIEWD. YOU CAN GO THROUGH ALL THE  SCIENTIFIC GOBBLEDEGOOK YOU  LIKE. I DON'T BELIEVE THEM.
Jon:  THIS WAS THE  HISTORIC ELECTION BETWEEN  SCIENTIFIC GOBBLEDEGOOK, OR AS WE CALL IT, ARITHMETIC. ( LAUGHTER )  AND BELIEF, BELIEF WAWNS GOING  DOWN OUT A FIGHT WHICH LED TO  WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU. NOW,  ( LAUGHTER )  MY FRIEND, EVENTUALLY SOME DAY I  WILL DIE, AS WILL YOU, AND  EVERYONE YOU KNOW AND LOVE. BUT THIS SEGMENT FROM FOX NEWS  ELECTION COVERAGE TAKEN AT THE  PRECISE MOMENT THEIR INTERNAL RESEARCH SQUAD ANNOUNCED OHIO  AND THE PRESIDENCY WOULD BE  AWARDED TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, I BELIEVE THIS FOOT ANNUAL, UPLIKE  US, WILL LIVE FOREVER.
DO YOU BELIEVE OHIO HAS BEEN  SETTLED?
NO, I DON'T AND LOOK IF-- IF  WE ARE CALLING THIS ON THE BASIS  OF 47% OF THE VOTE BEING IN AND WHEN 77% IS IN SECRETARY OF  STATE SAID THE-- I GOT THE  DIRECTOR OF THE OHIO CAMPAIGN FOR ROMNEY ON THE OTHER END OF  THE LINE REFRESHING THE PAGE  EVERY FEW SECONDS.
Jon:  GO ON...
IT'S GOING TO BE A REPUBLICAN  VICTORY. THIS IS A HISTORIC REPUBLICAN  COUNTY. THER TARGET IS 64. THEY'RE AT 59 WITH BASICALLY,  THE EARLY VOTE COUNTED. IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO EDGE  UP.
BIG SWATCHES OF BUTLER  COUNTY, DELAWARE COUNTY, AND  WARREN COUNTY, ALL OF WHICH ARE REPUBLICAN COUNTIES WHICH HAVE  BIG CHUNKS OF THE VOTE OUT.
IS THIS JUST MATH YOU DO AS A  REPUBLICAN TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL  BETTER OR IS THIS REAL?
Jon:  DID YOU CATCH THAT! DID DID YOU CATCH THAT RIGHT? THERE? THAT THE THE MOMENT. DID YOU RECORD IT AND TIVO IT. YOU CAN PLAY IT BACK WARDS AND  FORWARD ALL DAY. I JUST WANT TO GET IT STRAIGHT,  KARL, VERY QUICKLY-- ARE YOU  LYING TO YOURSELF OR TO THE MILLIONS OF VIEWERS 'CAUSE  YOU'RE LIEIN' BY THE WAY, MACT  YOU DO AS A REPUBLICAN TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER IS A MUCH  BETTER SLOGAN FOR FOX THAN THE  ONE THEY HAVE NOW. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  BUT YOU KNOW-- DELICIOUS. LIKE WHEN TRUMAN BURBANK FIRST  SUSPECTED THE WORLD HE'D BEEN  LIVING IN WAS NOT WHAT IT SEEMED, DISCOVERY WOULD TAKE A  VOYAGE.
KARL ROVE SAID THAT WE SHOULD  FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DEAL IS WITH  THIS DECISION DESK. THE DECISION DESK IS IN A  DIFFERENT PLACE. MEGYN, I WILL ESCORT YOU DOWN  THE STEPS HERE. MEGYN IS GOING TO GO TO THE  DECISION DESK AND INTERVIEW THEM  ABOUT THE DECISION ON OHIO.
Jon:  THIS WAS 10 THAT--  THEN THAT MEGYN KELLY, IN  PURSUIT OF SOMETHING CALLED FACTS, LEFT THE HOLODECK AND  ENTERED THE WORLD OF DUNDER  MIFFLIN.
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE  AMOUNT OF RAW VOTE THAT'S IN  THESE COUNTIES THAT'S OUT THERE STILL WAITING TO COME IN IS SO  LARGE, NO MATTER WHAT THE HAND  FULL OF REPUBLICAN PRECINCTS THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE, IT'S  JUST NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.
100% CERTAINTY.
99.95%.
Jon:  SO YOU'RE SAYING  THERE'S A CHANCE. ( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )  LAST NIGHT, TRAGICALLY, THERE  WAS AN AVALANCHE ON BULL ( BLEEP ) MOUNTAIN, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN, WITH THE BLAME FOR IT  IF TO THEIR OWN WILLFUL  BLINDNESS? THEIR A SUPPER OF MISINFORMATION  GRUEL THEY THEMSELVES COOKED UP  AND HAD TO AT SOME DEEP LEVEL OF COGNITION KNOW CONTAINED FAR  MORE THAN OF THE F.D.A. ALLOWANCE OF BULL ( BLEEP )?
THE WHITE ESTABLISHMENT IS  NOW THE MINORITY.
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE,  THOUGH, THAT THE MAJORITY OF  AMERICANS WOULD BELIEVE THAT INCURRING MORE DEBT IS GOOD FOR  OUR ECONOMY, FOR OUR CHILDREN'S  FUTURE, FOR JOB CREATORS.
IT'S NOT A TRADITIONAL  AMERICA ANYMORE, AND THERE ARE  50% OF THE VOTING PUBLIC WHO WANT STUFF.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE  MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WOULD  BELIEVE THAT IT'S OKAY NOT TO FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT  HAVE A BUDGET.
WHO IS GOING TO GIVE THEM  THINGS? PRESIDENT OBAMA. PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY ARE  ENTITLED TO THINGS. ( LAUGHTER ). ( BOOING ).
Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP )  BALLS. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY TO TELL  YOURSELVES. "WE WOULD HAVE WON IF IT WEREN'T  FOR THE MORAL FAILINGS OF THE  THE NONE REAL AMERICA. IT'S WHITE PEOPLE JUDO."  FOX LOST BECAUSE LAST NIGHT  MINORITIES WHO FEEL ENTITLED TO THINGS, CAME AND TOOK THE  COUNTRY AWAY FROM THE  SELF-SUFFICIENCY, WHITE MEDICARE RETIREES AND UPPER CLASS  TAX-AVOIDANCE EXPERTS, OR AS  THEY'RE ALSO KNOWN-- YOUR  AUDIENCE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
