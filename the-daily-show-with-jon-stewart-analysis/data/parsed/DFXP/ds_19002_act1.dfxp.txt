FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: HEY!  WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. MAN DO WE HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT A BOOK I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS EXCITED ABOUT A BOOK IN GOD KNOWS HOW LONG, I MEAN YOU KNOW HALF THE CRAP I HAVE TO READ ON THIS SHOW, BUT THIS BOOK, THE AUTHOR IS NOT DAVID MITCHELL, DAVID MITCHELL IS GOING TO BE ON HERE PROMOTING IT. IT IS A BOOK WRITTEN BY A JAPANESE 13-YEAR-OLD BOY ABOUT WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE AUTISM. IT IS INCREDIBLE. ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS I THINK I HAVE EVER READ. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST NIGHT'S MARCH TOWARD GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, THE CABLE NEWS NETWORKS WERE SO EXCITED THEY WHIPPED OUT THEIR CLOCKS, TRANSITIONING RELENTLESSLY FROM COUNT DOWN CLOCK TO BEFORE SHUTDOWN TO COUNT DOWN CLOCK AFTER SHUTDOWN BECAUSE ON CABLE NEWS THIS IS THE DEMARCATION POINT IN HISTORY ON PAR WITH THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.
BY THE WAY, CNN HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN A NEW SHOW, TIME OF DAY.
COMING UP ON OUR 6 O'CLOCK HOUR, 6 O'CLOCK.
KIDDING, CNN WOULD NEVER GIVE A SHOW TO A CLOCK, THEY WOULD GIVE IT TO TWO PUNDITS WITH OPPOSING VIEWS ABOUT WHAT TIME IT IS. CLOCKFIRE! TONIGHT AT 8:00, NO, IT IS AT THREE!
THERE YOU HAVE IT. THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF A FEW BRAVE HOUSE REPUBLICAN  MORONS WE ALL GET TO NOW CELEBRATE THE MARCH OF DUMBS.
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN! LET'S HEAR IT!
FROM AN ACTUAL CONGRESSMAN AS TO WHY WE HAD TO SHUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOWN.
WE JUST WANT TO HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET BY AND THROUGH IS ONE OF THE MOST INSIDIOUS LAWS EVER CREATED BY MAN, AND THAT IS OBAMACARE.
Jon: BRAVO. NOT JUST ONE OF THE MOST INSIDIOUS LAWS BY AMERICA, WHICH HAS JIM CROW AND SLAVERY ON ITS RESUME OF LAWS, BUT BY MAN, PUTTING OBAMACARE UP WITH THE NUREMBERG LAWS, THE SPANISH INQUISITION AND THE MEDIEVAL LAW WHERE ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT, THE KING GETS TO SLEEP WITH YOUR WIFE.
HEY HE MAY BE BANGING MY BRIDE BUT AT LEAST HE IS NOT FORCING ME INTO A HEALTHCARE EXCHANGE. I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT STANDING BETWEEN ME AND THE GUY THAT APPLIES MY LEECHES. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE PEASANT HAS AN ACCENT LIKE THAT BUT IT SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE FROM JERSEY. ANYWAY, THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE THE INCREDIBLY UNPOPULAR MOVE OF FORCING A SHUTDOWN OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, TO SAVE US ALL FROM HAVING THE KING BANG OUR WIVES. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO. FOX! TO THE DAMAGE CONTROL STATION!  MAN THE STRAW MAN. I WONDER IF IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE THE SEQUESTER WHERE BEFORE THE SEQUESTER WE HEARD ESSENTIALLY THE SKY IS GOING TO FALL AND YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL THE PAIN IMMEDIATELY. NOT SO MUCH. THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED IS SOME MUSEUMS CLOSED AND SOMEONE CAN'T GO TO THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
WE WERE WARNED THE SKY WAS GOING TO FALL BUT THE SUN CAME UP, DIDN'T IT?
NO ONE TOLD YOU THE SKY WAS GOING TO FALL. NO ONE TOLD YOU THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN HAD THE SAME EFFECT AS AN ASTEROID HITTING THE PLANET. THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DID AFFECT THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD TELL US THAT IS HAPPENING. BUT THE POINT IS, ON FOX, NO BIGGY.
WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT YESTERDAY AND WENT THROUGH A LIST OF WHAT WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE HE SAID WE WILL HAVE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, MEDICARE, GO TO THE DOCTOR, I WAS SITTING THERE, WAIT A MINUTE, HE IS MAKING THE CASE FOR THE REPUBLICANS, IT IS PRETTY GOOD.
MAYBE I AM ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT THIS DOESN'T IMPACT ME MENTALLY. WE HAVE HAD 17 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, GOVERNOR, I AM NOT AFRAID OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.
Jon: HOW BAD CAN IT BE IF IT DOESN'T PERSONALLY AFFECT SEAN HANNITY? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY SHUT DOWN SMITH AND WOLLENSKY FOR PRIVATE EVENTS. OR CLOSED OUR NATION'S STRATEGIC FLAG GRAPHIC RESERVES. OR IF ROGER AILES IMPLEMENTED A NO GRUNTING POLICY IN THE MEN'S ROOM. SO IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS THAT IF ENDED, THE CASUAL OBSERVER MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY FEEL PHYSICALLY BUT NEVERTHELESS MAY HAVE AN EFFECT.
NASA, THE EPA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE WOULD ESSENTIALLY STOP FUNCTIONING, WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES FORCED TO STAY HOME.
68 PERCENT OF THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IS, QUOTE, FURLOUGHED.
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE MAJORITY OF ITS FOOD SAFETY, COSMETIC ACTIVITIES.
Jon: REALLY?  WE MAY NOT BE REVIEWING THE PRODUCTS. HOW WEIRD, I AM JUST INTRODUCING ONE SAFE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT TO THE MARKETPLACE. HELLO, FRIENDS. ARE YOU TIRED OF THINKING WITH YOUR PENIS?  AND THEN HAVING YOUR PENIS MAKE TERRIBLE DECISIONS?  WELL, SUFFER NO MORE, PEOPLE, WITH NEW BRAIN COCKTIN, BRAIN COCKTIN IS A NOT AT ALL DANGEROUS OR MYSTERIOUS BLEND OF HOUSEHOLD CLEANING SUPPLIES AND VARNISH, NATURAL BLEND OF HERBS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO GROW YOUR PENIS'S BRAIN, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU HEARD ME, SOON YOUR LITTLE HEAD WILL HAVE THE BIG IQ. HEY, GUY WHEN YOU ARE DONE URINATING CAN YOU HELP ME WITH MY CALCULUS HOMEWORK?
THANKS, BRAIN COCKTIN!. IT TOTALLY WORKS AND HAS NO SIDE EFFECTS I AM, I AM NOT REQUIRED TO TELL YOU ABOUT AS LONG AS THE FDA IS OFFLINE.
BRAINCOCKTIN FINALLY, YOUR COCK CAN PAY ATTENTION. AND HAMBIEN, THE ONLY SLEEPING PILL THAT IS CLEARLY NOT KOSHER
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S AN INTERESTING GIF FOR THE INTERNET, ME OPENING A BOTTLE OF BRAINCOCKTIN AND GOING LIKE THIS. ALL RIGHT. ENJOY THAT!, BUZZ FEED!
SO, A COUPLE OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE CLOSED. IS THIS SHUTDOWN REALLY GOING TO HURT ANYONE?
THE SHUTDOWN WILL ALSO SUSPEND THE SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN.
Jon: LA, LA, LA, LA, LA. SEE?  NOBODY. IT IS LIKE TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY. EXCEPT INSTEAD OF CANDY IT IS FOOD. AND THE REPUBLICANS, THAT ALL ADDS UP TO A, I DON'T KNOW, I AM JUST NOT FEELING IT.  ONE SOUND BITE THAT EXPRESSES THIS WORLD VIEW -- IT IS THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.
IF YOU BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS IT IS TIME TO GO AND BUY SOME TANG AND GET IN THE SURVIVAL BUNKER.
AFTER BUYING SOME TANG.
Jon: HA, HA, HA, HA. (BLEEP) YOU!  BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, FIRST OF ALL -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Jon: FIRST OF ALL, DEMOCRATS AREN'T THE ONES WITH SURVIVAL BUNKERS. THAT IS YOU GUYS. AND SECOND I KNOW FOR YOU POTTED MEAT AND TANG IS SHORTHAND FOR (BLEEP) YOU WOULDN'T IMAGINE EATING UNLESS THERE WAS A CATASTROPHE BUT THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IT IS THE (BLEEP) THEY EAT THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER AFFORD. OF COURSE I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT THE REPUBLICANS DON'T GET UPSET BY THE EFFECTS OF REDUCED GOVERNMENT SERVICES. WE REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE SCREAMING ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.
THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO CANCEL PUBLIC TOURS OF THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU HAVE ALL THE KIDS SCREAMING AND MOANING THEY CAN'T GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE TOURS NOW.
HE IS PLAYING A POLITICAL GAME SAYING I AM CLOSING THE WHITE HOUSE, HE IS PUNISHING THOSE KIDS.
HE IS EVEN SCARING LITTLE KIDS. HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?
MY GRANDSON ROBERT WHO YOU KNOW, HE AND HIS CLASS, WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE TOUR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO, THEY LOVED IT, BUT THE PRESIDENT, WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING IS AN ABSURDITY.
THE POLITICIANS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB AND THE CHILDREN GET PUNISHED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?
Jon: EVERYTHING!  HEY, YOUR KID DIDN'T GET BREAKFAST, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. MY KID DIDN'T GET TO TOUR THE WHITE HOUSE?  THAT IS EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM.
