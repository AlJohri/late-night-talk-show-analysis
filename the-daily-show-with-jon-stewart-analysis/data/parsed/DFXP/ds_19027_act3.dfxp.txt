[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A CORRESPONDENT FOR NBC NEWS. HIS NEW SPECIAL IS CALLED "WHERE WERE YOU THE DAY J.F.K. DIED?"
THIS WAS A SHOE STORE YOU WERE RUNNING?
CORRECT.
JOHN BREWER SAW OSWALD PEERING THROUGH THE WINDOW. WHAT MADE YOU FOLLOW HIM?  A FEELING I HAD SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE PICTURE. WHY DO YOU PRETEND TO BE SHOPPING FOR SHOES WHEN THIS COMMOTION IS GOING ON. NOW YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS SHOT AT THAT POINT?
OH, SURE, YEAH.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM TOM BROKAW. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I WAS STRUCK WATCHING SOME OF THE SPECIAL AT HOW EMOTIONAL A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE AROUND THE SCENE OF IT. YOU TALKED TO NOT JUST THE WIDOW OF LIKE THE POLICE OFFICER THAT WAS KILLED BUT THE SURGEON THAT WAS IN -- THE 31-YEAR-OLD SURGEON.
IT WAS A DEFINING MOMENT IN THE LIVES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE, JON. I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. I WAS 20 WHEN HE WAS ELECTED. IT WAS A BIG MOMENT IN MY LIFE BECAUSE IT CHANGED POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THIS WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT WE ALL SHARED BECAUSE OF TELEVISION. HE WAS IN EVERYONE'S HOME EVERY NIGHT. WE HAD NOT HAD THAT PHENOMENON BEFORE HE WAS SO CHARISMATIC. BY THAT STAGE OF HIS PRESIDENCY HIS NUMBERS WERE GOING UP. HE HAD BECOME POPULAR AGAIN AFTER THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS. IT WAS A REAL TRANSITION IN HOW WE PERCEIVED POLITICANS AND THE CONNECTION WE FELT TO THEM. IT WAS SUCH A VIOLENT ENDING. I WAS A REPORTER IN OMAHA AND I REMEMBER READING IT ON THE AIR. I HAD TWO PARTS OF MY MIND WORKING PERSONAL AND ALSO THINKING THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY.
Jon: IT USHERED IN AN ERA OF VIOLENCE AND UPHEAVEL BUT IT WAS THE IGNITION POINT FOR THAT. PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO -- I GUESS YOU WOULD GO -- WHO WAS THE LAST PRESIDENT TO HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED FROM THAT POINT McKINLEY.
YES.
Jon: NOBODY --
SHOTS WERE FIRED AT ROOSEVELT. TRUMAN, THE PUERTO RICAN NATIONALS CAME UP AND GOT INTO THE -- THIS GUY SEEMED TO US WATCHING HIM AT THAT TIME LIKE HE WAS INVULNERABLE. HE WAS SO GREAT LOOKING. THE PRESIDENCY WAS GOING WELL. JACKIE SITTING BESIDE HIM. SUDDENLY RIFLE SHOTS AND AMERICA CHANGED PROFOUNDLY. WE WENT BACK TO THE KIND OF OLDER -- LYNDON JOHNSON TAKING THE OVAL OFFICE AND THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION WAS OVER.
Jon: YOU REMEMBER THE TRANSFORMATION THAT BOBBY KENNEDY UNDERWENT AFTER THAT ASSASSINATION. I WAS VERY YOUNG WHEN BOBBY KENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING WERE ASSASSINATED. I REMEMBER THOSE EVENTS VIVIDLY. THE DEFINING MOMENTS I REMEMBER AS A KID AND THERE WAS TAUNTING IN THERE BUT MOSTLY THE ASSASSINATIONS.
I THINK NO ONE MADE A MORE IMPRESSIVE TRANSITION MIDSTREAM THAN BOBBY KENNEDY. HE WAS JACK KENNEDY'S ENFORCER, HIS CLOSEST COUNSELOR, A TOUGH GUY BEHIND THE SCENES. IT WAS ALWAYS BOBBY PUTTING HIS FINGER IN SOMEBODY'S CHEST. OBVIOUSLY IN 1968 BECAUSE OF WAR AND CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT COULD YOU SEE DEVELOP ON THE FLY ALMOST HE BECAME THE MOST INTERESTING POLITICIAN OF THAT ERA.
Jon: WHEN YOU ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE DOWN THERE, AS YOU SPEAK TO THEM, ARE THEIR MEMORIES DO THEY FEEL PERSONAL OR ALMOST A NARRATIVE CREATED FROM THE DAY, FROM ALL THE EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED FROM THAT DAY? IS IT DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THOSE THINGS?
I THINK FOR THEM IT'S VERY PERSONAL. THEY RESERVED A PART OF THEIR MEMORY BANK AND EMOTION FROM THAT DAY. EMJOHN BREWER YEAR WHO YOU SAW THERE HE DID MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO GET OSWALD EARLY BECAUSE HE FOLLOWED HIM TO THE MOVIE THEATER. HE CHANGED HIS LIFE. HE GOT OUT OF DALLAS, WENT IN THE NAVY FOR A WHILE. THIT'S JUST BEEN RECENTLY THAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO COPE AGAIN WITH THE IDEA OF JOHN BREWER THAT FOUND OSWALD AND HE COULD HAVE A LIFE. NFL FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY ON THAT SUNDAY BUT THEY WERE TOLD TO.
Jon: PEOPLE FORGET, TOO, THE REACTION TO DALLAS IN GENERAL WAS HARSH. THE CITY ITSELF IT'S ATHLETIC TEAMS IT'S PEOPLE. PEOPLE WERE -- THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT THEIR ANGER AND DISTRESS AND THEY DIRECTED IT SOMETHING AT A CITY.
IT TURNS OUT DALLAS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. LEE HARVEY OSWALD HAD A BROTHER THERE.
Jon: ONE OF THE GUYS OBVIOUSLY.
WE DO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL.
Jon: YOU DEAL WITH THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES. WHEN THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE WIDOW OF THE COP THAT OSWALD KILLED, HOW DO THEY RECONCILE THAT?
THERE'S A CIRCUS OF CONSPIRACY, PEOPLE WITH CARD TABLES TELLING YOU THE VIDEO TAPES, PICTURES OF THE AUTOPSY OR HIM ON THE EXAMINATION TABLE I SAY THERE WERE SIX EYE WITNESSES THAT SAW HIM SHOT. THEY SAY YEAH BUT HE HAD AN  AUTOMATIC AND IT WAS A REVOLVER AND ALMOST NONE OF IT ADDS UP IN THAT CASE. I'M PERSUADED IT WAS OSWALD.
Jon: FASCINATING DOCUMENTARY. THERE'S THIS BOOK THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT WHERE WERE YOU THE DAY J.F.K. DIED AIRS ON NBC THIS FRIDAY NIGHT AT 9:00 P.M. THE COMPANION BOOK IS ON THE SHELVES NOW, RIGHT?
IT IS. IT'S EXACTLY THE 50th ANNIVERSARY ON THIS FRIDAY.
Jon: I WAS ALMOST A YEAR OLD WHEN IT HAPPENED I REMEMBER THINKING EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.
AND I REMEMBER AS WELL BECAUSE WE'VE GONE BACK IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD THEY TALK ABOUT YOU HAD A TASTE FOR CHICAGO PIZZA.
Jon: THAT'S IT BROKAW. TOM BROKAW.
