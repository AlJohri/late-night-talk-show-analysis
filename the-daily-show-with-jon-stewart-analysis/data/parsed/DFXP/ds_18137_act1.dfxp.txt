FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S  WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN  NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,  MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER. I'M STILL HERE,  UNFORTUNATELY, FOR JON  STEWART WHO IS CURRENTLY  ATTEMPTING TO BREAK THE WORLD RECORD FOR SMASHING  THE MOST WATERMELONS WITH  HIS HEAD IN UNDER TWO  MINUTES. HE'S--   (LAUGHTER)  ES HE'S GOOD. HE SPENT THE TIME WELL. MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR OF A  NEW BOOK ABOUT THE LIFE OF  RIPLY'S BELIEVE IF OR NOT CREATOR ROBERT RIPLY NEAL  THOMPSON IS HERE. BUT BEFORE WE LEFT LAST WEEK  WE DISCUSSED HOW RIDICULOUS  IT WAS THAT THE 2016  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SPECULATION HAD ALREADY  BEGUN. COULD IT BE HILL ROE  CLINTON, PROBABLY. COULD IT BE CHRIS CHRISTIE,  POSSIBLY. COULD IT BE RAND PAUL,  ABSOLUTELY NOT. (LAUGHTER)
THAT IS NOT GOING TO  HAPPEN. BUT ALL THIS SPECULATION  LAUNCHED OUR NEW SEGMENT  CAN'T YOU AT LEAST WAIT  UNTIL JON STEWART COMES  BACK. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, 2016 IS  THREE YEARS AWAY. AND I'M ONLY HERE FOR TWO  MORE WEEKS. SO IT IS NOT TOO LONG TO  WAIT. BUT THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES  JUST KEEP COMING.
NEXT PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION IS NEARLY THREE AND  A HALF YEARS AWAY BUT  SENATOR CRUZ'S TRAVEL ITINERARY LOOKS MORE LIKE A  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAN  A FRESHMAN SENATOR.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. ARE YOU RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT?
JOHN, WE ARE HAVING A  NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT WHICH  DIRECTION THE COUNTRY SHOULD  GO.
YOU WERE BORN IN CANADA. COULD YOU-- ARE YOU EVEN  ELIGIBLE TO BE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES.
MY MOTHER IS BORN IN  DELAWARE, SHE IS A U.S. CITIZEN SO I'M A U.S. CITIZEN BY BIRTH.
THAT SHOULDN'T BE A  PROBLEM THEN. BECAUSE AS WE KNOW  REPUBLICANS ARE NOTHING IF  NOT UNDERSTANDING ON THAT  PARTICULAR ISSUE. AS LONG AS YOUR MOTHER WAS  BORN IN THE UNITED STATES,  YOU COULD BE BORN ANYWHERE ON EARTH AND BE COMPLETELY  ACCEPTED AS A VIABLE  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. OKAY. SO CRUZ IS KIND OF IN. OR HE REALLY LOVES SPENDING  TIME IN IOWA SO HE'S  DEFINITELY IN. ANYONE ELSE?
ARE YOU LAYING THE  GROUNDWORK NOW FOR 2016.
I'M OPEN TO LOOKING AT A  PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN 2016  BUT GOT A LITTLE WAYS, GOT ELECTIONS IN 2014.
AH, SEND YOUR SWEATER  VEST. YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO  RUN AGAIN BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE  TO FRESHEN UP YOUR CAMPAIGN A BIT. HOW ABOUT THIS TIME YOU ONLY  WEAR SWEATER SLEEVES.
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A  CLOSET FULL SOMEWHERE. THAT IS FISCALLY  RESPONSIBLE. NOW AT THIS POINT YOU ARE  PROBABLY THINKING THE CLOWN  CAR IS FULL. BUT--   (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT  CLOWN CARS. JUST REMEMBER, THE LEGENDARY  LIST OF CANDIDATES THERE  2012. MANY OF WHOM, LEAD IN THE  POLLS AT ONE POINT. REMEMBER HERRMANN CAIN ONCE  LEAD IN THE POLLS. DID HE HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL  OF BECOMING PRESIDENT? AND PLEASE ANSWER IN GERMAN.
NINE, NINE, NINE.
WHY DANKA. DANKA SHUN. SO FRANKLY THE REPUBLICANS  BETTER HAVE SOMETHING PRETTY  SPECIAL UP THEIR SLEEVE IF THEY'RE GOING TO TRY AND  BEAT WHAT THEY DID LAST  TIME.
DONALD TRUMP LAST WEEK  CONFIRMED THE NATIONAL  REVIEW THAT HE IS AGAIN  CONSIDERING A RUN IN 2016.
DO IT. JUST DO IT. LOOK AT THIS. DO IT. I WILL PERSONALLY WRITE YOU  A CAMPAIGN CHECK NOW ON  BEHALF OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH DOES NOT WANT YOU TO BE  PRESIDENT BUT WHICH BADLY  WANTS YOU TO RUN. SO LOOK BEFORE WE GET  CARRIED AWAY HERE, YOU MAY  NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHO  YOU ARE VOTING FOR IN 2016.
LAST MONTH WHEN THE  SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN  SECTION 4 OF THE VOTING  RIGHTS ACT THE COURT OPENED THE FLOODGATES TO A TIDAL  WAVE OF STATE RESTRICTION.
A TIDAL WAVE, A VOLCANO  OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT, A  SHARK-NADO OF VOTER  SUPPRESSION. YES, EXACTLY. EXACTLY. IMAGINE YOUR VOTING RIGHTS  BEING SUBJECTED TO THIS.
THAT IS LET'S RALLY WHAT  THE SUPREME COURT HAS GIVEN  STATES LICENCE TO DO. BUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  IS ALREADY GEARING UP FOR  BATTLE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  TODAY CHALLENGED VOTING LAWS  IT SAYS DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RACE. ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER  MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN  PHILADELPHIA PLEDGING TO  FOCUS FIRST ON TEXAS WITHIN TEXAS FIRST, OKAY. APPARENTLY ERIC HOLD  CERTIFICATE  APPARENT-- APPROACHING VOTER  RIGHTS PROTECTION LIKE WE HIS FIRST DAY IN PRISON. LOOK, I'M GOING FIND THE  BIGGEST-- THERE AND BEAT THE [BLEEP] OUT OF HIM. I'M SENDING A MESSAGE HERE. THE OTHER STATES WILL FALL  IN LINE. (APPLAUSE)  BUT LOOK, LOOK, I'VE GOT TO  SAY WHAT HAS TEXAS DONE TO  DESERVE THAT?
LITERALLY TWO HOURS AFTER  THE COURT'S RULING, TEXAS  OFFICIAL SAID THEY WOULD BEGIN ENFORCING A NEW VOTER  REQUIREMENT EVEN THOUGH A  FEDERAL COURT STRUCK DOWN THE LAW BECAUSE IT QUOTE  IMPOSES STRICT UNFORGIVING  BURDENS ON THE POOR AND  RACIAL MINORITIES IN TEXAS.
COME ON, TEXAS. WHAT WERE YOU DOING FOR TWO  WHOLE HOURS? DID IT TAKE YOU THAT LONG TO  MAKE THE CALL BECAUSE YOUR  HAND WAS SHAKING TOO MUCH FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF BEING  ABLE TO DISENFRANCHISE  VOTERS? AND LET'S BE CLEAR. TEXAS IS NOT ALONE IN ITS  RUSH TO IMPLEMENT  RESTRICTIVE NEW VOTING LAWS. IN A PHRASE THAT IS ALMOST  NEVER UTTERED IN A  FLATTERING CONTEXT, FLORIDA  IS ALSO LEADING THE WAY.
FLORIDA CAN GO AHEAD WITH  THE VOTER PURGE. A LAWSUIT WAS FILED LAST  YEAR TO STOP THE STATE FROM  TAKING NAMES OF SUSPECTED  NON-CITIZENS OFF THE VOTER  ROLES. IT WAS DISMISSED YESTERDAY  IN A SUIT, LOST ITS FOOTING  AFTER THE SUPREME COURT  STRUCK DOWN PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
AH, YES, FLORIDA, WHERE  YOUR GRANDPARENTS AND YOUR  RIGHT GOES TO DIE. BUT PERHAPS A SURPRISE  CONTENDER FOR MOST DRACONIAN  VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION  CAME FROM A LITTLE FURTHER  NORTH.
LAST WEEK NORTH CAROLINA  PASSED ONE OF THE MOST  RESTRICTIVE VOTER  SUPPRESSION BILLS IN THE  NATION. A BILL THAT SLASHES IN HALF  THE STATE'S EARLY VOTING  PERIOD, THEN ELIMINATES SAME DAY VOTING REGISTRATION THAT  REQUIRES VOTERS TO SHOW A  GOVERNMENT ISSUED I.D..
IT DOESN'T STOP THERE T  ALSO PLACING ALL VOTING  BOOTHS ON BUOYS SO THEY ARE ONLY ACCESSIBLE BY YACHTS. NOW THE THING THAT OCCURS TO  ME IN ALL OF THIS  LEGISLATION IS WHAT PROBLEMS  ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
THE STATE ELECTIONS BOARD  SAID THAT THEY'VE ONLY HAD  ONE DOCUMENT CASE OF VOTER IMPERSONATION FRAUD IN 2012. YOU SAY --
THE IMPORTANT THING IS  ENHANCING CONFIDENCE IN  ELECTIONS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS  ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN  PEOPLE SHOW UP TO VOTE THEY ARE WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE.
OKAY, STOP THERE. BECAUSE AS I BELIEVE HAS  BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE  PROBLEM ISN'T PEOPLE SHOWING  UP TO VOTE AND NOT BEING WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE, IT'S  PERSON AS IN ONE, SINGULAR,  ONE GUY OUT OF FOUR AND A  HALF MILLION PEOPLE WHO VOTED IN THE LAST ELECTION. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HONESTLY, YOU COULD HAVE  GOTTEN THE SAME RESULTS BY  JUST PASSING A BILL THAT SAID DAVE CAN'T VOTE, HE  KNOWS WHY. SO IF THAT'S NOT REALLY THE  REASON, THEN LET'S TRY THIS  AGAIN. WHY ARE YOU DOING THERE?
ACCORDING TO NORTH  CAROLINA'S BOARD OF  ELECTIONS, A THIRD OF VOTERS  HERE WITHOUT A PHOTO I.D. ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
AND THERE IT IS. GOES TO SHOW IT'S TRUE,  ALWAYS BET ON BLACK. ACTUALLY, NORTH CAR LINE'  VOTER-- HEY, WHO ARE YOU  ANGRY WITH? ! WHO ARE YOU-- THE JOKE  STANDS. ACTUALLY, NORTH CAROLINA  VOTER I.D. LAW IS JUST THE  TIP OF A TRUE [BLEEP]BURG OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION.
IN NORTH CAROLINA THE  REPUBLICAN CONTROL STATED  LIMIT APPROVED NEW LIMITS ON ABORTION CLINICS TACKED ON A  BILL DESIGNED TO BAN ISLAMIC  SHARIA LAW.
HOLD ON, LET ME JUST  UNDERSTAND THIS YOU'RE  ADDING ABORTION RESTRICTIONS TO LEGISLATION BANNING THE  MAKING OF LAWS BASED UPON  RELIGIOUS BELIEF? THAT'S LIKE PASSING A BILL  BANNING HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN  SYRUP AND ADDING A PROVISION NAMING THE STATE ANIMAL THE  GUMMI BEAR. NOW TO BE FAIR, TO BE FAIR,  THAT WAS ONLY THE NORTH  CAROLINA STATE SENATE. THE STATE HOUSE DID NOT DO  SOMETHING AS AMAZINGS ATTACK  AN ANTIABORTION LIMIT ON A ANTISHARIA BILL. THEY TACKED IT ON SOMETHING  ELSE.
WHAT DOES ABORTION HAVE  TO DO WITH MOTORCYCLE  SAFETY?
GOOD QUESTION? (LAUGHTER)
GOOD QUESTION. THAT'S A TRICKY ONE. IS IT THAT VOTERS INVOLVE  GUYS IN LEATHER JACKETS YOUR  PARENTS DIDN'T WANT YOU TO  DATE? S.
REMEMBER LAST WEEK WE  WERE TALKING ABOUT A NEW  ABORTION BILL IN THE STATE SENATE THAT WAS TIED TO  SHARIA LAW BAN, WE TALKED  ABOUT THAT.
WE Z THIS WEEK THE  REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED NORTH  CAROLINA HOUSE ATTACHED A SIMILAR BILL TO A MOTORCYCLE  SAFETY BILL.
THAT DOES SEEM RIDICULOUS. ABORTIONS HAVE NOTHING IN  COMMON WITH MOTORCYCLE  HELMETS. FOR ONE THING YOU CAN GET A  MOTORCYCLE HELMET PRETTY  MUCH ANYWHERE. BUT AFTER-- AFTER A NORTH  CAROLINA LEGISLATIVE SESSION  LIKE THIS, I THINK THE BIG TAKE AWAY HERE MIGHT BE YOUR  MOVE, SOUTH CAROLINA. OH, YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD  CRAZIEST CAROLINA ALL SEWN  UP DIDN'T YOU WITH YOUR RUN  AWAY GOVERNORS AND RAMPANT HORSE [BLEEP] AND IT GIVES  ME NO PLEASURE SAYING THIS. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOSE
