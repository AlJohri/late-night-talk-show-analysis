[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK MY GUEST  TONIGHT 12-TIME ALL STAR MAJOR  LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER AND MOST HOME RUNS BY A CATCHER. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "LONG  SHOT."  PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  MIKE PIAZZA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HAVE A SEAT, MY MAN. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU.
Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS ON  EVERYTHING.
THANK YOU.
Jon: INCLUDING THE BOOK  "LONG SHOT."  HERE IS WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE  HE WAS NOT A SURE SHOT FOR THE MAJOR LEAGUES. YOU WERE DRAFTED -- WHAT WAS  YOUR DRAFT POSITION?
THE 62 HND ROUND.
12 TEAMS STOPPED DRAFTING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT WASN'T A BIG PRIDE BOOSTER  COMING IN.
Jon: DID YOU GUESS -- YOU  WERE WAITING BY THE PHONE AND  NOTHING RANGE OR YOU WERE, YOU KNEW IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU WERE GOING TO GET A TRYOUT.
I GOT A TELEGRAM THREE DAYS  AFTER THE DRAFT.
Jon: REALLY?
OH, BY THE WAY IT WAS  SELECTED. BELIEVE IT OR NOT I WAS ELATED  BUT AGAIN, I REALIZED AT THIS  TIME IT WAS A BIG MOUNTAIN  CLIMB.
Jon: NOT ONLY DO YOU CLIMB  IT, MORE HOME RUNS THAN ANY  CATCHER IN HIM. .308 BATTING AVERAGE. THE BEST HITTING CATCHER BAR  NONE IN MAJOR LEAGUE HISTORY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] RIDICULOUS.
IT WAS A GREAT RUN.
Jon: AND ALMOST THE MORE  PHENOMENAL ASPECT OF IT IS THAT  YOU DID MOST OF THAT OR AN ALL OF LOT OF THAT AS AN NEW YORK  MET. [ LAUGHTER ] AND AS YOU AND I BOTH KNOW,  USUALLY WHEN YOU GO TO THE METS,  YOU BREAK A FEMUR, --
YOU GET ARRESTED.
Jon: YOUR ARM FALLS OFF. IT'S THE THING. IF YOU DO GO TO THE HALL OF  FAME, AND I THINK YOU WILL GO TO  THE HALL OF FAME. THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME BEING  ELIGIBLE AND YOU GOT 50% ARE YOU  GOING AS A MET OR DODGER?
I WOULD THINK THE METS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I TALK ABOUT THAT A LOT. YOU KNOW, I CAME UP WITH THE  DODGERS AND I I WAS FORTUNATE  GOING TO THE MINOR LEAGUES BECAUSE OF THEIR TRADITION  COACHED BY ROY CAMPNELLA AND DON  DRIESDALE SANDY COFAX. HIS A LOT OF ADVANTAGE COMING UP  WITH THE DODGERS.
Jon: IF YOU HAD COME UP  WITH THE METS YOU COULD HAVE  BEEN COACHED BY MOOKIE, THE  MOOKSTER. HE WAS ACTUALLY GOOD. EDDIE MARTIN COULD HAVE THROWN  STUFF YOUR WAY. [LAUGHTER] NOBODY GOT IN. NO MODERN PLAYER GOT IN BECAUSE  OF STEROID CLOUD. NOW, YOU CAN'T WIN WITH THAT. IF YOU DENY DOING IT NOBODY  BELIEVES YOU AND IF YOU SAY YOU  DID IT THEN EVERYBODY -- WHY WRITE THE BOOK?
I WROTE THE BOOK BECAUSE I  THINK I HAD A REALLY COOL STORY. I FELT LIKE HIS TO ADDRESS IT IN  THE ERA I PLAYED IN AND I D. A  LOT OF REACTION WAS WHEN THE HALL VOTE HAPPENED AND NO ONE  GOING ON THEY WERE LIKE HE HAS  TO TALK ABOUT IT AND THEN I CAME OUT WITH THE BOOK AND THEY ARE  LIKE WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT IT  FOR. HE HAS TO SAY SOMETHING. WHAT IS HE DOING THIS FOR? NEEDS THE MONEY.
Jon: NGO NO, HE DIDN'T.
IT'S NOT A MONEY THING.
Jon: HE HAD A GOOD  CONTRACT.
I DID.
Jon: DID THE GUYS KNOW IN  THAT ERA WAS IT UBIQUITOUS. YOU SAID IN THE BOOK GREENIES AM  FETE MEANS, CREATE TEEN, A  COUPLE OF PROTEIN SHAKES A LICE OF STUFF. EVERYBODY SEEMED TO PUSH  INCLUDING THAT POINT UP TO THE  POINT AT LEAST OF LEGAL YAMENT. DID THE GUYS KNOW, WAS IT AN  OPEN SECRET OF WHO WAS OVER THAT  LINE?
NOT IN MY CLUBHOUSE. ALL THE CLUBHOUSES I PLAYED IN  WERE PRETTY -- AS FAR AS THE  GAME GOES PRETTY CLEAN AS FAR AS  RUMORS. IF YOU PUT IT IN HISTORICAL  PERSPECTIVE THE GAME WAS  CHANGING. GUYS WERE REALLY JUST LIFTING  WEIGHTS IN GENERAL AND GETTING  BIGGER AND GOING TO THE GYM. WHEN I FIRST CAME UP YOU DON'T  LIFT WEIGHTS YOU'LL GET MUSCLE  BOUND. THE SWING WILL SLOW DOWN. GUYS BOUGHT BIGGER AND REALIZED  YOU COULD HIT HOME RUNS. CULTURALLY IT WAS CHANGING. ONCE YOU SAW THE RECORDS  COMPROMISED PEOPLE WERE GETTING  A LITTLE --
Jon: DID YOU MAKE A  CONSCIOUS CHOICE. DID YOU MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE  TO SAY BUT I WON'T DO -- WAS  THAT CONSCIOUS OR NEVER REALLY -- NOT LIKE PEOPLE --
OF COURSE IT WAS CONSCIOUS. AT THE TIME IT WAS LIKE, WHEN  YOU HIT THE GYM IT'S FUNNY LIKE  THE -- I REMEMBER AS A KID DYNAMIC TENSION AND I STARTED  LIFTING AND REALIZING --
Jon: YOU AND I BOTH. I WAS ON EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING! [LAUGHTER] IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
SOME GUYS BELLIES GET ON  STEROIDS, TOO.
Jon: IS IT TEXTING? DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT -- DO YOU  UNDERSTAND WHY SOME GUYS. THINK ABOUT THE CONTRACT YOU  GOT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY SOME GUYS  DO IT?
I OBVIOUSLY COULD UNDERSTAND  WHY FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE  BUT IT DOES SHALL FOR ME IT WAS COMPROMISING THE SPEG GREAT OF  THE GAME. AT LEAST MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL  WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS IT. IN THIS THEY'VE BEEN REALLY  PROACTIVE AT BEING IN THE  FOREFRONT. THEY HAVE HGH TESTING THIS YEAR.
Jon: UNFORTUNATELY IT'S  STILL OUT THERE. THIS WHOLE THING IN FLORIDA WITH  THE STEROIDS AND A LOT OF GUYS  GETTING CAUGHT UP.
AS I TRIED TO WRITE THE BOOK  SOMETIMES BEING A PROFESSIONAL  ATHLETE ISN'T A HEALTHY LIFE. YOU BLOW OUT KNEES, TEAR  LIGAMENT. YOU WEAVE IN THE AND OUT OF  THOSE, NOT JUST STEROIDS, PAIN  KILLERS, OBVIOUSLY BRETT FARVE TALKED ABOUT THAT. AGAIN, DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE A  CONSCIOUS EFFORT TOLL REALLY  TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND NOT FALL INTO THE EXSERKS YOU KNOW.
Jon: PEOPLE DON'T THINK  ABOUT THE LONG TERM  CONSEQUENCES. BIG CONTRACT LITTLE --SES A  CONTRADICTION. THE BOOK IS CALLED "LONG SHOT."  IT'S AN INTERESTING STORY. I DON'T GET A VOTE IN THE HALL  OF FAME BUT I SHOULD AND I VOTE  YOU IN NO MATTER WHAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.
