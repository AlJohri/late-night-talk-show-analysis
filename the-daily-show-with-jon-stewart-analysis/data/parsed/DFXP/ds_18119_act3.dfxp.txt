(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
John: WELCOME BACK, MY  GUEST TONIGHT A FILMMAKER WHOSE  UPCOMING DOCUMENTARY FOR HBO IS CALLED "GIDEON'S ARMY."
THE JUDGE IS GOING TO TELL  YOU THAT THE STATE FAILS TO  PROVE THEIR CASE IT IS YOUR DUTY, YOU MUST ACQUIT. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS  SYSTEM. IT'S SET UP TO GIVE PEOPLE THE  PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO  NOT JUST BE HEARD BUT HOLD THE  STATE ACCOUNTABLE. YOU WANT TO TAKE MY LIBERTY,  YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. AND IF YOU DON'T, ACQUIT. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE  UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION  GUARANTEES IT.
John: THAT'S WHAT I'M  TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE WELCOME DAWN PORTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  THE DOCUMENTARY IS MIND BLOWING.
OH!
John: "GIDEON'S ARMY."  WE'VE ALL SEEN IN DETECTIVE  SHOWS THROUGHOUT OUR CHILDHOOD YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN  ATTORNEY.
RIGHT.
John: AND, OF COURSE,  THAT'S ONLY ABOUT 50 YEARS OLD,  THAT RIGHT.
IT'S EXACTLY 50 YEARS OLD.
John: SO GIDEON'S ARMY IS  BASED ON THE SUPREME COURT CASE.
"GIDEON V. WAYNE WRIGHT" IS  THE SUPREME COURT CASE THAT  ESTABLISHED YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY IN A CRIMINAL CASE. BEFORE THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT  RIGHT, WHICH MOST PEOPLE DON'T  KNOW.
John: AND AT THAT POINT YOU  WERE (BLEEP) OUT OF LUCK. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S RIGHT!
John: IN A JUDICIAL SENSE  YOU WERE (BLEEP) OUT OF LUCK.
THEY DIDN'T CALL IT THAT BUT  --
John: BUT THEY DEFINITELY  IMPLIED IT. SO THIS DOCUMENTARY SHOWS SOME  OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS WORKING  IN THE SOUTH ON ABSOLUTELY THE SHARP END OF JUSTICE AND IT IS  EASY NOT TO CARE ABOUT THIS. IT'S EASY NOT TO CARE ABOUT  DEFENDERS AND DEFENDANTS. THEY'RE NOT POLITICALLY SEUFRP  THET NICK GENERAL, LAWYERS AND  DEFENDANTS. BUT THIS AFFECTS ALL OF US IF WE  COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE LAW.
YEAH. I'M A LAWYER AND I STARTED  MAKING THIS DOCUMENTARY BUT I  WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY. LIKE WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS  TERRIBLE JOB? YOU DON'T MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,  YOU DEFEND PEOPLE WHO HAVE  GOTTEN ACCUSED OF TERRIBLE THINGS BUT WHEN YOU SEE LAWYERS  LIKE TRAVIS AND YOU SEE -- YOU  KNOW, THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR THE  CONSTITUTION. THEY ACTUALLY READ IT AND THEY  --  (LAUGHTER).
John: RIGHT. TRAVIS IS A REMARKABLE MAN. HE PUTS HIS ACQUITTALS UP ON THE  WALL OF HIS OFFICE.
HE DOES.
John: AND THE NAMES OF THE  DEFENDANTS WHOSE CASE HE IS  LOSES HE TATTOOS ON TO HIS BACK. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
HE DOES.
John: AND YOU WORRY AS YOU  WATCH THIS THE WEIGHT OF THOSE  NAMES.
WELL, THEY'RE LIGHT TATTOOS. (LAUGHTER).
John: BLESS YOU FOR  MANAGING TO BE GLIB ABOUT THAT  BECAUSE IT'S -- IT'S -- HE BROKE MY HEART AND, YOU KNOW, I  SOMETIMES -- YOUR HEART NEEDS  BREAKING.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THAT'S --  TRAVIS IS ONE OF THOSE REALLY  SPECIAL PEOPLE THAT I FOUND SO MANY OF THEM AND THAT'S WHAT WAS  SO SURPRISING. HE TATTOOS THOSE NAMES BECAUSE,  AS HE SAYS, THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE  WITH HIM FOREVER. AND, YOU KNOW, I SPENT THREE AND  A HALF YEARS FILMING THE FILM IN  MISSISSIPPI, ALABAMA, GEORGIA AND I SAW SO MANY HEARTBREAKING  THINGS AND SO NOW I KNOW EXACTLY  WHAT HE MEANS. I'M NOT A TATTOO PERSON BUT I  REMEMBER EVERYBODY WHO WAS  CONVICTED AND IT'S REALLY  TERRIBLE. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONVICT  SOMEBODY LIKE TRAVIS SAYS IN THE  CLIP, WE'VE GOT TO DO IT RIGHT. THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS BE FAIR  TO PEOPLE.
John: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE  NUMBERS ALONE, EVEN OUTSIDE OF  THE EMOTION. 2.3 MILLION. THAT HAVE'S A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT  OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE NUMBER ONE. (LAUGHTER).
John: THAT'S TRUE. SUCK IT, CHINA, NUMBER ONE. (LAUGHTER)  NEVER MIND IN WHAT, STILL NUMBER  ONE. 80% OF PEOPLE CHARGED CANNOT  AFFORD LAWYERS. 90% TO 95% PLEAD GUILTY.
YEAH.
John: THEY DON'T GO TO  TRIAL. THAT SEEMS TO OBFUSCATE THE  6th AMENDMENT, DOES IT NOT?
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT,  MOST PEOPLE -- LIKE YOU STARTED  OUT SAYING YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY. WE ALSO THINK YOU HAVE A RIGHT  TO TRIAL. BUT IF 95% OF PEOPLE ARE  PLEADING GUILTY TO SOMETHING,  ONLY 5% OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TRIAL AND MOST OF THOSE ARE POOR  PEOPLE. SO MOST OF THE POOR PEOPLE  GETTING ARRESTED ARE GOING TO  PRISON. AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CAN DO  BETTER THAN THAT.
John: THERE'S ANOTHER  INCREDIBLE MOMENT WHERE ONE OF  THE DEFENDANTS, SHE'S ON THE PHONE WITH A MOTHER OF SOMEONE  SHE'S REPRESENTING AND SHE'S  TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THIS WOMAN $2,000 BAIL. IF SHE CAN GET THAT BAIL, THEY  CAN GET AN ACQUITTAL AND THE  MOTHER IS EXPLAINING TO HER ON THE PHONE SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE  MONEY AND YOU SEE SOMETHING  INSIDE HER BREAK. YOU SEE SOMETHING IN THAT LAWYER  BREAK. AND IT IS -- SEEING AS THEY'RE  NOT GOING TO BE COMPENSATED,  THAT SEEMS OBVIOUSLY CLEAR, THE VERY LEAST THEY CAN BE IS  (BLEEP)ING APPRECIATED FOR WHAT  THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE IT'S -- THAT'S RIGHT. THE LEAST THEY CAN BE IS  (BLEEP)ING APPRECIATED.
John: IT'S LITERALLY THE  LEAST YOU CAN DO.
I'LL TELL HBO.
John: DO YOU HAVE TIME TO  STICK AROUND AND GO TO THE WEB? IT'S A REMARKABLE DOCUMENTARY.
FOR YOU? YES.
John: "GIDEON'S ARMY"  PREMIERS JULY 1 ON HBO AT 9:00  P.M. FIND A FRIEND WHO HAS HBO OR  STEAL HBO. (LAUGHTER)  DAWN PORTER, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. (CHEERS AND
