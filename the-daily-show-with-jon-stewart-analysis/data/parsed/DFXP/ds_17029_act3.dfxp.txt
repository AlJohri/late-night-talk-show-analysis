(   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A PHOTOGRAPHER. HIS PHOTOS FROM HIS MANY TRIPS TO IRAQ ARE DISPLAYED IN HIS NEW BOOK, IRAQ PERSPECTIVES. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM BEN LOWY. ( APPLAUSE ) SO THIS IS A SELECTION OF OR A COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS FROM IRAQ FROM THE YEARS....
2003 TO 2008.
Jon: HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU GO TO IRAQ TO COLLECT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS THROUGH THOSE YEARS?
WAY TOO MANY. MORE THAN MY WIFE WOULD HAVE LIKED.
Jon: THAT MANY TIMES. LET ME TELL YOU HOW THIS HAPPENED. SO WE DID THIS ROLLING STONE PIECE. THEY SAID, OH, WE'RE GOING TO SEND OVER THIS PHOTOGRAPHER. HE'S JUST GOING TO HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS FOR A DAY AND TAKE SOME PICTURES. WE THOUGHT, OKAY, WE'LL ROUGH HIM UP A LITTLE BIT. THIS GUY SHOWS UP. WHERE WERE YOU BEFORE THIS? WHERE WAS IT?
LIBYA.
Jon: YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I GET AROUND.
Jon: YOU GET AROUND. SO WE GO, WHO ARE YOU? IT TURNS OUT YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING TO THESE... YOU'RE A PHOTOGRAPHER THAT TRAVELS TO  THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES IN THE WORLD.
THOSE AND OTHER PLACES. I MEAN I'VE DONE MY SHARE. I'VE DONE THE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIM SUIT SHOOT.
Jon: DID YOU TAKE ANY SHRAPNEL THERE?
IT WASN'T NECESSARILY SHRAPNEL.
Jon: THEY TELL ME IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAND SOMETIMES IN THE POOLS OF  WATER ARE NOT AS WARM AS YOU WOULD THINK.
IT CAN BE TOUGH WITH THE LIGHT AND THE SUNTAN LOTION, YEAH.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND. TELL ME WHAT... I JUST WANT TO SHOW SOME OF THESE. THE SELECTION OF PICTURES... THESE ARE ALL THROUGH HUMVEE WINDOWS. CAN YOU CUT TO THAT? DO WE HAVE ONE? IT'S THROUGH A HUMVEE WINDOW. THE ORANGE POST-IT IS NOT ACTUALLY PART OF THE BOOK.
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT.
Jon: IS THAT CENTRAL PARK IN BAGHDAD? WHAT IS THAT?
THAT IS ACTUALLY A RESIDENCY BUILDING FOR LIKE THE BASICALLY THE MINISTRY OF  PRISONS AND INTERIOR WHERE LAWYERS AND INVESTIGATORS LIVE BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST  IMAGES I MADE WHEN I THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA OF PHOTOGRAPHING IRAQ THROUGH HUMVEE WINDOWS. BUT IT'S AMAZING THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND IRAQ AT THE TIME IT'S ALL WIRE. ALL THIS FREEDOM WE SAY WE BROUGHT TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE. AT THE SAME TIME THE PEOPLE PASSED A LAW IN THEIR COUNTRY TO HIDE BEHIND THESE GLASS WALLS.
Jon: THAT'S INTERESTING. WERE THE IRAQIS RESENTFUL OF THE BLAST WALLS AND THOSE THAT WERE AROUND THEM?
NOT THE GUY WHO HAS THE CONTRACT TO MAKE THE BLAST WALLS. ACTUALLY DIRECTLY BEHIND THAT... I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF THE  CAR AND GO TO THE OTHER SIDE. RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BLAST WALLS WAS LIKE A SWING SET. WHERE LIKE, YOU KNOW, KIDS WERE PLAYING BECAUSE PEOPLE LIVE THERE.
Jon: IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU WERE TELLING ME... WHEN I WENT TO AFGHANISTAN, I WENT SURROUNDED BY MILITARY PERSONNEL WITH GUNS. I WAS WEARING A FLAK JACKET. I ASKED YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO AFGHANISTAN. HOW ARE YOU GETTING THERE? IT WAS LIKE I'M WALKING. LIKE IT WAS SOME CRAZY....
AFGHANISTAN IS A DIFFERENT, SORT OF A DIFFERENT BALLGAME. AFTER SO MANY YEARS IN IRAQ EMBEDDING WITH U.S. SOLDIERS THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE  WORKED IN AFGHANISTAN I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH U.S. SOLDIERS. I JUST KIND OF GO ON MY OWN. IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TO SEE IT FROM THE OTHER SIDE. I WOULD SAY IN AFGHANISTAN IT'S A LOT EASIER TO WORK ON THE STREET OR WITH AFGHANS  WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF NATO.
Jon: REALLY?
I GREW UP IN NEW YORK IN THE '80s.
Jon: THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING. I LIVED HERE IN THE '0s. HAVING A GUY TRY TO SELL YOU SOMETHING BY THE PARK IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING IN AFGHANISTAN. LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS ANOTHER PICTURE FROM IRAQ THAT I WANTED TO SHOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN GET THAT. IT'S A WOMAN... THE THING I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING HERE IS NOT THE EGGS BUT RIGHT NOW TO HER. THAT WHITE BLOCK. WHAT IS THAT?
THAT IS ICE. IT WAS SORT OF AMAZING. I ENDED UP RESEARCHING IT. THERE ISN'T A LOT OF ELECTRICITY IN IRAQ. SOME IN BAGHDAD. MAYBE FOUR HOURS A DAY. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE FREEZERS. YOU HAVE TO GO BUY YOUR ICE. FROM A STORE. THERE ARE ACTUALLY FACTORIES FOR MAKING ICE THAT PEOPLE GO GET A SLICE OF. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE NOT USED TO IN THE WEST THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS REALLY REVEALING.
Jon: I PUSH A CUP INTO MY REFRIGERATOR. WHEN THAT DOESN'T WORK, I CURSE THE HEAVENS. DID YOU SEE IMPROVEMENT DURING YOUR TIME THERE? DID YOU SEE THINGS CHANGE?
DEFINITELY THINGS CHANGED. I MEAN, THE 2004 TO 2007 WAS HELLISH. BUT THEN IN 2008 THINGS, YOU KNOW, WERE STARTING TO GET BETTER.
Jon: YOU KEPT GOING.
YEAH.
Jon: BECAUSE YOU'RE NUTS. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER.
THAT I'M NUTS?
Jon: YEAH.
MY WIFE THINKS SO.
Jon: LOOK AT THIS ONE. THIS IS THROUGH THE NIGHT VISION. THAT'S A GENTLEMAN WHO I BELIEVE IS JUST SAYING, OH, MY GOSH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE  GOING TO TAKE MY PICTURE. I WOULD HAVE SHOWERED.
WELL, I WAS WITH A UNIT GOING OUT BASICALLY WHEN THE SUNNI AWAKENING BEGAN AS THE  ORGANIZATION LIKE, THEY BASICALLY USED INFORMANTS. AT SOME POINT THESE GUYS WOULD GO OUT WITH U.S. SOLDIERS AND SAY WE KNOW WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE. THEY WOULD PICK OUT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS IS SOUTH OF BAGHDAD. THEY WENT OUT TO A RAID TO DIFFERENT VILLAGES. THEY WOULD BE JUST LIKE, OH, THAT GUY, HE LIKES AL QAEDA. I THINK THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO SELL THEMSELVES. THIS IS A GUY WHO IS JUST BASICALLY SLEEPING IN A MECHANIC'S SHOP OUTSIDE. IT WAS 120 DEGREES DURING THE DAY. MOST PEOPLE SLEEP OUTSIDE AT NIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY FOR AIR CONDITIONING. THEY JUST WOKE HIM UP AND JUST ARRESTED HIM. HE'S JUST TOTALLY SLEEPING.
Jon: YOU'RE JUST BEHIND THEM WITH A CAMERA LIKE (SNAPPING) DO YOU HAVE A FLASH?
NO. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE NIGHT VISION.
Jon: NOW TO BE FAIR TO YOUR WIFE WHO YOU KEEP SAYING, WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE DO FOR A LIVE SOMETHING.
SAME THING.
Jon: IRAQ PERSPECTIVE. WHAT YOU DO IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW HOW ANGRY WE WERE WITH YOU THAT WHOLE DAY. HE WAS JUST HANGING OUT WITH US AND THE WHOLE TIME HE WAS JUST TAKING PICTURES GOING, "THESE GUYS ARE SUCH PUSSIES."
I DID IT FOR THE SCHWAG. I REALLY LIKE THE BARBECUE COLOGNE.
Jon: (LAUGHING) THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. IRAQ PERSPECTIVES ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. WHAT IS THE NEXT PLACE YOU'RE TRAVEL TO GO.
TO HAITI IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.
Jon: A VACATION. TROPICAL. YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME. IT'S NICE. TAKING THE WIFE? BEN LOWY.
