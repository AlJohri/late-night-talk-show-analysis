(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT STARS ON CBS'S  BLUE BLOOD. ALSO THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF  TNT'S NEW REALITY SHOW ABOUT  BOSTON'S POLICE OFFICERS CALLED BOSTON'S FINEST
I DON'T WANT TO GET UP AT  5:00 IN THE MORNING AND GO TO  BOXING. I THINK OF BEING IN A FOOT CHASE  AND LOSING. THERE'S THE CHANCE YOU'LL BE  FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE ON THE  SIDE OF THE ROAD WHERE YOUR BACK-UP IS A MINUTE AWAY. I HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF MY  GAME. IT COULD SAVE MY LIFE. IT COULD SAVE MY PARTNER'S LIFE.
DIG IT IN. DIG IT IN.
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF  RESPONSIBILITY THAT I TAKE VERY  SERIOUSLY.
Jon: PLEASE WELCOME DONNIE  WAHLBERG. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   MY MAN. LOOK AT YOU. SHARP AS A TACK, MY FRIEND. SHARP AS A TACK. HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. I FELT THE NEED TO DRESS UP  TONIGHT
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU  SOMETHING? MUCH RESPECT TO YOU. MANY OF OUR GUESTS COME HERE AND  THEY BELIEVE IT'S THE LAST STOP,  THE QABOOS. THEY COME IN WITH LIKE A SACK, A  THING. THEY DON'T CARE. YOU, SIR,
I CARE  Jon: THANK YOU  I CARE  Jon: I APPRECIATE THAT. NOW, YOU'RE PLAYING A NEW YORK  CITY COP ON YOUR SHOW. YOU'RE DOING A SHOW ABOUT BOSTON  COPS. I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE GETTING  READY TO PULL SOME [BLEEP] ON  THE EAST COAST.
I THINK I'VE BEEN ALREADY  PULLING SOME [BLEEP] ON THE EAST  COAST FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. PLAYING A NEW YORK COP AND BEING  FROM BOSTON IS VERY, VERY  DELICATE. IT'S VERY DELICATE. AND THE WRITERS ON BLUE BLOOD,  YOU KNOW, THEY LOVE TO NEEDLE ME  BECAUSE THEY KNOW I'M A CELTICS, RED SOX, BRUINS, PATRIOTS FAN.
Jon: THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE  HAVE FOR TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THOUGH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY WRITE  LINES FOR ME LIKE "THE PATRIOTS  SUCK."
Jon: JUST TO TAUNT YOU  MY PARTNER WAS DATE AGO GUY  WHO WAS A PATRIOTS' FAN. MY ONLY RESPONSE WAS DUMP THE  JERK. THEY CONSTANTLY ARE NEEDLING ME  BESIDES THE FACT THAT THE  PATRIOTS LOST THE SUPER BOWL AND THEY HAD TO COME BACK FROM THE  SUPER BOWL TRYING TO EVERYONE ON  SET PUTTING POSTERS ON MY DRESSING ROOM DOOR AND GIANTS'  BANNERS EVERYWHERE AND PICTURES  OF ELI MANNING
Jon: I HAVE THAT IN MY ROOM  TOO BUT IT'S DIFFERENT. I HAVE A BED SPREAD OF HIM. IT MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE. YOU'VE HAD YOUR RUN THOUGH. BOSTON HAS HAD, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE  DEALING IN OUR CITY WE DON'T  WANT TO TALK SPORTS ALL OF THEM. THE RANGERS WE HAVE ONE  CHAMPIONSHIP IN 90 YEARS. THE KNICKS HAD A COUPLE IN THE  '70s. I'M A METS FAN
(SCRATTERRED APPLAUSE N)  Jon: THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE  LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM.
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION WHEN  THE METS LAST WON IT WAS AGAINST  MY RED SOX IN THAT VERY FAMOUS BILL BUCKNER PLAY. WE SHOULDN'T TALK SPORTS. I HAVE TO SAY THIS BILL BUCKNER  THING. LET ME CLEAR THIS UP. BILL BUCKNER WHEN HE MISSED THAT  BALL THE GAME WAS ALREADY TIED. IT HAD SLIPPED AWAY. OUR BULLPEN WAS TIRED. SLIPPING AWAY. THE PLAY BEFORE THAT, BOB  STANLEY WAS PITCHING
Jon: THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE  BROUGHT STANLEY IN
I BELIEVED STANLEY WOULD WIN  IT FOR US.
Jon: OF COURSE YOU WOULD  BELIEVE THAT. YOU'RE FROM BOSTON
I STILL WAKE UP SOME MORNINGS  AND SAY, DID WExD LOSE? BUT BOB STANLEY THREW AN INSIDE  PITCH. RICH GEDMAN DIDN'T MOVE ENOUGH  FOR THEM. THAT WAS THE PLAY, THE FASTBALL  TIED THE GAME. I SAW RICH IN INTERVIEWS LATER. I LOVE YOU, RICH. HE SAID, "I WAS SO COLD IN THAT  LAST INNING THAT I COULDN'T  REALLY MOVE. I WAS KIND OF STUCK FROZEN."  TO ME THAT WAS VALIDATION THAT  HE DIDN'T GET TO THAT BALL THAT BILL STANLEY THREW.
Jon: A BOSTON GUY AND IT MUST  HAVE BEEN 50 DEGREES THAT NIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE... "I WAS TOO  COLD"? IT WAS OCTOBER. THEY DIDN'T PLAY IN ANTARCTICA. COME ON!
HERE'S THE THING. THE METS WON. AND ALL THAT SUFFERING WE WENT  THROUGH LED US UP TO 2004 WHEN  WE KICKED THE YANKEES' ASS.
Jon: THE DETAIL IN WHICH YOU  REMEMBER THAT IS THE SAME AS THE  DETAIL IN WHICH I REMEMBER THESE  THINGS. MY WIFE, WHOM I LOVE AND I'VE  BEEN WITH ALMOST 20 YEARS, THERE  IS NOTHING IN OUR WORLD THAT I HAVE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL  REMEMBRANCE OF. LIKE SHE'D BE LIKE REMEMBER OUR  WEDDING? I'D BE LIKE, OH, YEAH, THERE WAS  A CAKE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT  BASEBALL. HE WAS WEARING A VERY LIGHT  SWEATER. THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT YOU  REMEMBER THESE SPORTS MOMENTS IS  INCREDIBLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COP SHOWS. SO THE BOSTON GUYS, THE BOSTON  COPS MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE  RELUCTANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH  THIS. YES?
I THINK ANY COP WORTH THEIR  SALT DON'T WANT TO JUST GET  INVOLVED IN A REALITY SHOW RIGHT  AWAY. I THINK FOR ME, YOU KNOW, I KNOW  PLAYING A COP I PLAY ONE ON TV. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LIGHT OF  THAT. I'VE WORKED WITH COPS AND  PROBABLY PLAYED 800 JOBS IN MY  ACTING CAREER. I'VE HAD 801 JOBS AND 800 WERE  COPS. THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT. THAT'S HELPED ME AND PREPARED ME  TO BE THE RIGHT GUY TO PRODUCE  THIS SHOW. I THINK I KNOW...
Jon: THEY TRUSTED YOU BY THE  FACT THAT YOU'RE FROM THERE. YOU'VE HUNG AROUND COPS. THEY TRUST YOU YOU WITH THIS
I'M A BOSTON BOY. I'M SORT OF KNOWN IN BOSTON. THANK YOU. I'M SORT OF KNOWN. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE FIRST TALKED  TO TNT ABOUT DOING THE SHOW, ME  AND MY PARTNERS WENT AND MET WITH THEM. THEY WERE LIKE WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT DOING A BOSTON COP SHOW. I SAID, LOOK, WE'LL ONLY DO IT  WITH YOU, WITH THIS NETWORK. WE CAN'T DO IT ON ONE OF THESE  ROWDY NETWORKS WITH BILLY CLUB  SMASHING...
Jon: IT WON'T BE LIKE THE  SHIRTLESS GUYS GETTING PULLED  OUT OF...
ONCE IN A WHILE. BUT IT'S BOSTON. I HAVE TO REPRESENT MY CITY THE  RIGHT WAY. I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THESE  CRAZY REALITY SHOWS THAT PEOPLE  MAKE. I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING CLASSY  THAT SHOWS THESE COPS IN BOSTON
Jon: HOW DIFFICULT A JOB IT  IS
ABSOLUTELY. SO WE WENT TO THE MAYOR FIRST. THE MAYOR, HE SIGNED OFF RIGHT  AWAY. AND THE COMMISSIONER SIGNED OFF  AFTER THAT. AND THE CHIEF SIGNED OFF AFTER  THAT. ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE THEY  WERE SIGNING OFF. THEY ALL SAID THE SAME THING. TALK TO THE OFFICERS. IF THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE WITH YOU  IN THE CAR, YOU'RE GETTING OUT  OF THE CAR AND TAKING YOUR CAMERA AND GO HOME. AS LONG AS THE OFFICERS WANTED  TO DO. THE OFFICERS, HAVING PLAYED A  COP AND WORKED LIKE A NEW YORK  CITY DETECTIVES, OUR TECHNICAL ADVISORS ON BLUE BLOODS, HE'S  TAUGHT ME THE MOST IMPORTANT  THIBLG. ALL ABOUT GETTING HOME SAFELY TO  YOUR FAMILY. DO YOUR JOB. PROTECT THE STREET. PROTECT YOUR PARTNER AND GET  HOME SAFE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I KNEW THAT AND BROUGHT THAT TO  THE SHOW. ME AND THE WHOLE...
Jon: BOSTON'S FINEST. GOING TO PREMIERE ON TNT THIS  WEDNESDAY AT 9:00. BLUE BLOOD
