WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, IN THE WEEKS  LEADING UP TO THE RECENT  ELECTION AMERICA'S BUSINESS  LEADERS OFFERED SOME DIRED  PREDICTIONS.
FOUR MORE YEAR OF OBAMA  WILL MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE TO TIGHTEN OUR BELTS EVEN FURTHER, LAYOFF MORE  FEEL.
THESE PEOPLE JUST WANT TO  WORK IN HONOR AND DIGNITY  AND THIS PRESIDENT IS DESAING THAT. WE'RE GOING CANCEL THEIR  HEALTH CARE.
I CANNOT PAY MY STAFF AND  PAY ALL THESE TAXES. THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH BLOOD  YOU CAN GET OUT OF A TURNIP. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I DON'T THINK YOU  CAN GET ANY BLOOD OUT OF A  TURNIP UNLESS-- OH MY GOD, THOSE WEREN'T TURN IS, OH. SOME BUSINESS OWNERS WERE  EXPLICIT THAT AN OBAMA  RE-ELECTION WOULD IN THEIR  EYES DOOM THEIR BLOOD TURNIP  BUSINESSES. BUT NOW THAT OBAMA HAS BEEN  RE-ELECTED HOW HAVE THE JOHN  CREATORS AMONGST US REACTED. WE TURN TO OUR DERANGED  BILLIONAIRE, JOHN HODGMAN,  JOHN.
OH, HOW DARE YOU.
Jon: WHAT.
HOW DARE YOU APPLAUD ME  NOW AFTER YOU SHIFTLESS  MOOCHERS REJECTED EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT AND  WEALTHY IN THIS WORLD.
Jon: YOU'RE STILL UP SET  THAT MITT ROMNEY LOST.
I DON'T KNOW HOW, I DON'T  UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENED,  JOHN. I MEAN WE ALL AGREE THAT  WEALTHY AMERICANS ARE THE  BEST AMERICANS.
Jon: WELL, NOT-- NOT  EVERYBODY AGREES WITH THAT.
WELL, EVERYBODY ONE I  KNOW DOES AND MITT ROMNEY  WAS THE WEALTHIEST AMERICAN, OR AT LEAST THE WEALTHIEST  WHO WAY WILLING TO TOUCH  YOUR HANDS AND LIFT YOUR  BABIES. I MEAN ROMNEY WAS A RICH  MAN. AND HE WANTED TO BE  PRESIDENT WATCH. PORE COULD HE HAVE DONE TO  EARN YOUR VOTE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS  HAPPENING WITH THIS COUNTRY  ANY MORE, JOHN.
Jon: DID YOU JUST BLOW  YOUR NOSE WITH 100 DOLLAR  BILL.
I CAN'T USE A 50th, GRANT  HAIR IS TOO SCRATCHY.
Jon: SORRY, JOHN.
OH, YOU WILL WILL BE SAR  I'M. YOU WILL ALL BE SARREE. YOU WILL REGRET CROSSING US  JOB CREATORS BECAUSE YOU  WANTED EURO BAMA GIFT ITS OF COLLEGE LOANS AND GAY LOVE  AND MARIJUANA, OF COURSE YOU  SAY WHOOO TO MARIJUANA. BUT HOW ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH  WILL YOU FEEL WHEN I REFUSE  TO GIVE YOU A GOOD JOB DEEP FRYING GRUEL FOR $4 AN HOUR.
Jon: YOU DEEP FRIDAY  GRUEL.
YOU KNOW I OWN A CHAIN OF  THEME RESTAURANTS BASED ON  THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, DON'T NEW.
Jon: I ACTUALLY DID NOT.
OF COURSE.
Jon: I WAS AND WARE.
ITS WITH CALLED PLEASE  SIR, MAY I HAVE SOME MORE. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
YEAH. ALL THE WAY TO ORPHANS OR  WILL BE. BUT NOW THAT YOU RE-ELECTED  OBAMA I AND THE OTHER DE  RANGED BILLIONAIRES CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THE DEMANDS. WE MIGHT HAVE TO START  SHIPPING JOBS OVERSEAS.
Jon: START? COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SHIPPING  JOBS OVERSEAS FOR YEARS.
I HATE TO SAY IT ONCE  OBAMA CARE KICKS IN I MIGHT  HAVE TO MAKE EVERYONE AN PART-TIME EMPLOYEE TO AVOID  PAYING THEIR HEALTH  INSURANCE.
Jon: THAT IS PRETTY  STANDARD CORPORATE TACTIC. BELIEVE ME, DUDE --
WELL NO MATTER HOW HARD  YOU WORK I MIGHT JUST HAVE  TO KEEP YOUR WAGES STAGNANT.
Jon: THAT'S ALREADY THE  CASE!
JON, ALL THESE-- THAT YOU  AND YOUR FELLOW C.E.O.s HAVE  BEEN MAKING ARE REALLY EXACTLY WHAT THE C.E.O.s  HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 30 YEARS  NOW. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE.
THE DIFFERENCE, WELL, IT  USED TO BE MOTIVATED BY  SIMPLE PROFIT. NOW WE'RE DOING IT OUT OF  SPITE. AND AS OUR FINAL PUNISHMENT  TO YOU WE'RE LEAVING, JON. WE'RE GOING GOLF, LIKE AN  ATLAS-- HERE, HERE, READ IT. I'LL WAIT.
Jon: I'M FAMILIAR WITH  ATLAS SHRUG, JOHN GALT AND  OTHER TOP INDUSTRIALIST AS BAN DON'T AN UNGRATEFUL  NATION, FORMED THEIR OWN  SOCIETY IN A SECRET VALLEY  IN COLORADO.
YES.
Jon: THAT'S WHAT ARE YOU  DOING.
WE HAVE ALREADY DONE IT,  JON. TECHNICALLY IT'S MORE LIKE A  SECRET CONDOMINIUM  DEVELOPMENT IN SAR SOCIETYA  OPEN ONLY TO THOSE VIRTUOUS ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE ENORMOUS  AMOUNTS OF MONEY OR TO HAVE  INHERITED A LOT OF MONEY. BUT NO POWERBALL WINNERS,  JON, JUST QUALITY PEOPLE.
Jon: SO HOW IS THIS  COMMUNITY GOING.
GREAT, IT'S GOING GREAT,  GOING GREAT. WHAT COULD BE MORE INVIG  RATING THAN SPENDING ALL DAY  WITH OLDER WHITE GUISE AND THEIR THIRD WIVES. IN FACT, I JUST CAME BACK TO  SAY GOOD-BYE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, WELL,  GOOD-BYE.
AND TO GIVE YOU ONE LAST  CHANCE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
YOU COULD HOLD ANOTHER  ELECTION RIGHT NOW, GET A  DIFFERENT RESULT.
Jon: I THINK WE'RE GOOD. YOU TAKE THE BOOK.
GOOD-BYE.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
UNLESS YOU WANTED TO  BRING BACK SLAVERY, WE COULD  STICK AROUND-- WZ.
Jon: THAT'S NOT HAPPENING,  GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE FOREVER.
Jon: ALL RIGHT, JOHN.
I'M SEE, DID YOU HEAR YOU  GROV ELING IN APOLOGY.
Jon: NO, I SAID OKAY, YOU  CAN GO.
I DON'T-- DON'T MAKE ME  GO, JON.
Jon: WHAT?
IT'S A NIGHTMARE OVER  THERE. NOTHING BUT MONEY MANAGERS  AND TRUST FUNDS AND TRUMPS,  NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO COOK OR CLEAN OR MAKE, WHAT IS THAT  THING THAT KEEPS YOU WARM.
Jon: HEAT.
HEAT, YES. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM. TOO MANY CHIEFS, NOT ENOUGH  INDIANS, YOU KNOW WHAT I  MEAN, OR MEXICANS. I MISS THE MEXICANS. I MISS THEM SO MUCH. MI SO SORRY. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO LEAVE. DO YOU HAVE A CLEAN 1200  BILL.
Jon: NO, I DON'T, JOHN
