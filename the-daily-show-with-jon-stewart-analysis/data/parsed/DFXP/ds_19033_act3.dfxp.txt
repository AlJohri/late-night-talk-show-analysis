[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT WAS PAKISTAN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES FROM 2008 TO 2011. HE IS CURRENTLY A PROFESSOR AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY. HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS."  PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM HUSAIN HAQQANI. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS, THE PREMISE HERE IS THAT PAKISTANI AND THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT REALLY ALLIES, THAT WE ARE -- HAVE A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP. IS THAT TRUE? [LAUGHTER]
LET ME SAY THAT AMERICANS SOMETIMES MAKE A MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT THE ONLY THING WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS WHO DO WE SHOOT OR WHO DO WE TAKE OUT FOR LUNCH. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE SOMETIMES MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT.
Jon: WHAT?
PAKISTAN IS JUST THE RIGHT COUNTRY --
Jon: YOU ARE TELLING US THIS NOW?
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU 50 YEARS AGO, TOO BUT YOU HAD TO MAKE THE MISTAKES FOR ME TO WRITE THE BOOK.
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS IN TRUE AMERICAN FASHION:  YOU'RE WELCOME. [ LAUGHTER ]
THANK HAVE YOU VERY MUCH. [LAUGHTER] -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: DO YOU THINK THESE ARE MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS OR DO WE BOTH REALLY KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING FROM OTHER SIDE?
IF THIS WAS A TRANSACTION CLEARLY LAID OUT THERE  WOULD HAVE BEEN LESSER PROBLEMS THAN WE'VE HAD. ON MANY OCCASIONS AND THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN THE BOOK. I DO KNOW HOW TO IN TRUE AMERICAN FASHION MAKE A PLUG FOR THE BOOK. PEOPLE HAVE TO READ IT.
Jon: SURE. IT'S QUITE GOOD.
PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS TOLD BY THE C.I.A. THAT PAKISTAN WAS GOING AHEAD WITH ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. HE ASKED THE PAKISTANI DICTATORSHIP AT THE TIME THAT WAS HELPFUL IN THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN. THE GENERAL PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART AND SAID NO WAY ARE WE MAKING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND RONALD REAGAN SAID, ALL RIGHT, OKAY, FINE I TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. THOSE ARE DELUSIONS. WHY WOULD A COUNTRY GIVE UP ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM UNLESS AND UNTIL THE BENEFITS OF GIVING IT UP OUTWEIGHED THE BENEFITS OF HAVING IT.
Jon: BECAUSE HE PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART WHICH IS -- AS YOU KNOW -- A BOND THAT CAN'T BE BROKEN.
I'M SURE THE GENERAL LEARNED FROM --
Jon: I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT. SINCE 1947 WE'VE BEEN GIVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AID TO PAKISTAN WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE STRATEGIC ALLY AGAINST THE SOVIETS, AGAINST NOW ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS. WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT THAT IS THE CASE?
WELL --
Jon: WHAT HAVE THEY DELIVERED ON AND WHAT DO THEY WANT FROM US OTHER THAN THAT MONEY?
YOU WERE TAKE BEING THE N.S.A. A LITTLE WHILE AGO. THE N.S.A. AT ONE POINT IN THE 1950'S. THERE WERE NO SATELLITES. THEY NEEDED A GROUND BASE FROM WHERE TO SPY ON THE SOVIET UNION. PAKISTAN OFFERED THEM ONE. THE FLIGHTS USED TO TAKE OFF FROM A PLACE NEAR PESHAWAR IN PAKISTAN. THOSE KIND OF ADVANTAGES ARE THE QUID PRO QUO. THE COST HAS BEEN ENORMOUS. PAKISTAN HAS BECOME ARMOUS. DYSFUNCTIONAL COUNTRY. ALMOST 42% OF THE PAKISTANI SCHOOL GOING AGE CHILDREN DON'T GO TO SCHOOL. YOU HAD MALALA HERE WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN A HEROINE IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY. SHE'S VILIFIED IN PAKISTAN BY SOME PEOPLE. THE ISLAMIST FUNDAMENTALISTS WHO WERE TRAINED TO FIGHT THE SOVIETS IN AFGHANISTAN ARE A NUISANCE FOR THE UNITED STATES GLOBALLY AND A REAL THREAT TO PAKISTAN, AFGHANISTAN AND INDIA. THE PROBLEM IS PAKISTAN'S LEADERSHIP FOCUSED ON ONE THING HOW TO MAKE PAKISTAN MILITARILY EQUAL TO INDIA. THE AMERICANS ASSUMED IF WE GIVE THEM ENOUGH MILITARY EQUIPMENT THEY'LL TURN AWAY FROM THAT PURPOSE. THAT WAS A MISTAKE BECAUSE PAKISTAN NEVER GAVE A SINGLE SOLDIER TO FIGHT THE SOVIETS EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT ACCEPTING THE AID ON THE PREMISE THEY WOULD HELP FIGHT THE SOVIET UNION.
Jon: IN SOME RESPECTS WE'VE MADE THIS EXACT SAME DELUSION WE'VE GIVEN THIS MONEY AND MILITARY STRENGTH IN THE HOPES OF BUILDING AN ALLY THAT WOULD NEVER TURN AROUND AND BITE US AND PAKISTAN HAS USED THE ISLAMIST MILITANTS IN THE EXACT SAME FASHION, GIVING THEM MONEY AND ARMS IN THE HOPES THEY WOULDN'T BITE THEM. AREN'T WE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME --?
ABSOLUTELY. HENCE THE PLURAL DELUSIONS. THERE ARE DELUSIONS ON BOTH SIDES. THE PAKISTANI MILITARY IS FIGHTING THE SAME PEOPLE IT TRAIN AND ARMED. THEY MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN GOOD TALIBAN AND BAD TALIBAN. THE DESIRE FOR INFLUENCE INN. AFGHANISTAN REMAINS A MAJOR OBSESSION.
Jon: IS THIS THE REASON WHY EDUCATION IS SO DIFFICULT TO COME BY IN PAKISTAN? IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED COUNTRY WITH SOPHISTICATED PEOPLE AND BRIGHT PEOPLE, WHY WOULD THEY ALLOW 43% OF THEIR PEOPLE NOT BE EDUCATED?
JON, PAKISTANIS ARE A WONDERFUL PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I'M ONE. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN --
Jon: YEAH. [  APPLAUSE  ]
THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND ESPECIALLY OUR MILITARY. WE INHERIT IT FROM THE BRITISH IN 1947 WHEN PARTITION OCCURRED. ONE-THIRD OF BRITAIN INDIAN ARMY BUT ONLY 17% OF THE RESOURCES. INSTEAD OF DECIDING THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? OUR MILITARY SHOULD BE TRIMMED DOWN TO THE SIZE THAT WE CAN AFFORD, WE ENDED UP SUPPORTING IT. EVEN NOW WHAT AMERICA HAS DONE TO PAKISTAN IS THAT IT HAS CREATED THIS DEPENDENCE INSTEAD OF RAISING TAXES, INSTEAD OF EXPORTING MORE, WE JUST WAIT FOR ASSISTANCE. AND WE HAVE A VERY LARGE MILITARY. WE HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SO IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST EXERCISING ONE ARM WHICH IS THE MILITARY. TOTALLY IGNORING EDUCATION. IN 1947, IN WHAT IS TODAY INDIA, HAD 18% LITERACY. WHAT IS TODAY PAKISTAN, 16. TODAY THAT DIFFERENCE HAS BECOME A 20% DIFFERENCE. THAT'S THE MISTAKE THAT HAPPENS WHEN FOREIGN POLICY IS MADE BASED ON DELUSIONS.
Jon: LET ME SAY THIS AGAIN YOU'RE WELCOME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Jon: STICK AROUND FOR A MINUTE. MAGNIFICENT DELUSIONS. ON BOOKSHELVES NOW.
