FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OH WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. WE'VE PUT IT TOGETHER. LATER ON IN THE PROGRAM, AL JAZEERA AMERICA CORRESPONDENT SUE TURTON. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE THREE JOURNALISTS THAT HAVE BEEN JAILED IN EGYPT AND, IN FACT, IN FACT, WE'LL START TONIGHT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE ISRAEL --
WHAT? ISRAEL ISN'T SUPPOSED TO DEFEND ITSELF?
OH YEAH IF MEXICO BOMBED TEXAS WOULD WE EXERCISE RESTRAINT?
WHAT OTHER COUNTRY IS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD AS ISRAEL?
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
IT'S A 4,000-YEAR-OLD CONFLICT.
DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- [BLEEPED]
SELF-HATING JEW. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: THAT WAS, THAT WAS WEIRD. [LAUGHTER] ANYWAY, WHAT I WAS, WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS LAST THURSDAY SAW THE START OF A NEW GROUND OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY ISRAEL.
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE] [BLEEPED] >>TRADITION! TRADITION. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: UM, HOLY [BLEEPED]. LOOK, OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE MANY STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS ISSUE, BUT JUST MERELY MENTIONING ISRAEL OR QUESTIONING IN ANY WAY THE EFFECTIVENESS OR HUMANITY OF ISRAEL'S POLICIES IS NOT THE SAME THING AS BEING PRO-HAMAS.
SO YOU'RE AGAINST MURDERED CHILDREN?
FREE GAZA, FREE GAZA!  [ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
ZIONIST PIG. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YOU NOW WHAT, [BLEEPED] IT. WHY DON'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT SOMETHING LIGHTER LIKE UKRAINE?
YEAH. I'M GOOD WITH THAT.
Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL, HERE WE GO THEN. THE WORLD IS STILL REELING FROM THE MYSTERIOUS MISSILE ATTACK OVER EASTERN UKRAINE, WHICH LAST WEEK TOOK DOWN A CIVILIAN MALAYSIA AIRLINES JET. THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION. A LOT OF FINGER POINTING. WHAT DOES THE EVIDENCE SAY?
THREE SA-11 MISSILE BATTERIES RECENTLY ENTERED UKRAINE FROM RUSSIA.
A MISSILE LAUNCH FROM A REBEL-HELD AREA WAS DETECTED BY U.S. INTELLIGENCE.
REBEL LEADERS TALKING ABOUT HIDING THOSE BLACK BOXES ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM MOSCOW.
Jon: SOURCES SAY FRAGMENTS OF THE MISSILE REEKED OF BORSCHT AND REPORTS INDICATE THAT WITHIN THAT MISSILE THERE WERE SEVERAL SUCCESSIVELY SMALLER NESTING MISSILES. [LAUGHTER] SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF EVIDENCE, BUT IT'S ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL. ARE YOU GOING TO CONVICT ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE?
ONE OF THE PRO-RUSSIAN MILITANT LEADERS TWEETED PROUDLY AT THE TIME THAT THIS PLANE WAS FIRST SHOT DOWN THAT HIS FORCES HAD TAKEN DOWN A UKRAINIAN MILITARY TRANSPORT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: OKAY. THAT'S A LITTLE STRONGER. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND A CONFESSION POINT TO THE RUSSIAN REBELS BEING SUPPLIED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW BY MOSCOW. PERHAPS THERE IS ANOTHER EQUALLY PLAUSIBLE ANGLE THE WEST HAD NOT CONSIDERED. ONE THAT'S GETTING MAINSTREAM AIRPLAY IN RUSSIA.
THEY SAY, "INSIDE WE'RE NOT LIVE PEOPLE BUT CORPSES. THE PLANE WAS FLOWN NOT BY REAL PILOTS. IT WAS ON AUTOPILOT. IN THE NECESSARY SPOT IT WAS BLOWN UP WITHOUT EVEN USING A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE." [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: SO EITHER POORLY TRAINED RUSSIAN INSURGENTS UTILIZING HIGH-LEVEL MILITARY TECH FROM RUSSIA MISTAKENLY BLEW UP A PASSENGER PLANE. OR... PERHAPS EQUALLY LIKELY, THE DUTCH, THE WORLD'S FLORISTS, LOADED CORPSES ONTO A PLANE IN AMSTERDAM AND DITCHED IT DIRECTLY OVER THE REBEL-CONTROLLED AREA OF EASTERN UKRAINE TO MAKE THEM LOOK BAD FOR NO [BLEEPED] REASON WHATSOEVER. [LAUGHTER] THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE US THE WINDMILL, THE POT BROWNIE AND A BED SHEET OVEN POWERED BY FARTS NOW GIVES US THE UNPROVOKED FLYING ZOMBIE PLANE. THAT IS SO LIKE THE DUTCH. EVEN WIKIPEDIA HAS PRONOUNCED THE RUSSIAN REBELS GUILTY.
AN INTERNET USER WITHIN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT REPORTEDLY REVISED A WIKIPEDIA ENTRY ABOUT MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 17. THE ORIGINAL ENTRY SAID THE PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN BY TERRORISTS OF THE SELF-PROCLAIMED DONETSK PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC. THE REVISED ENTRY WRITTEN LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER THE ORIGINAL SAID THE PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN BY UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS.
Jon: GOD THE RUSSIANS ARE GOOD. THE SAME WIKIPEDIA USER WENT ON TO NOTE THAT EVEN IF RUSSIAN REBELS HAD SHOT, TECHNICALLY GREEDO SHOT FIRST. [LAUGHTER] REALLY. GOT A FEW "STAR WARS" NERDS OVER TO THE RIGHT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] EVERYONE ELSE... SO DESPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE, PUTIN SAYS IT WASN'T HIM. IT'S WHAT WE IN THE JEW POLITICAL LITIGATION BUSINESS KNOW AS "THE SHAGGY DEFENSE." ♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪
BUT WE SAW YOU MOVE THE MISSILES.  ♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪
Jon: BUT WE HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT IT WITH THE REBELS. ♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪
Jon: WE SAW YOU KISSING ON THE SOFA ♪ IT WASN'T ME ♪
Jon: ALL RIGHT. YOU WIN THIS ROUND. PUTIN, DID THE LIPS MATCH THE SONG? I COULDN'T SEE IT. YES! [LAUGHTER] I ONLY...ALL RIGHT. CLEARLY THE STAKES ARE HIGH. WHOEVER SHOULDERS THE BLAME FOR THIS ATROCITY IS GOING TO BE THE TARGET OF GLOBAL ANGER. AND RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S RUSSIA'S FAULT BECAUSE IT'S RUSSIA'S FAULT. OF COURSE, THAT DOESN'T MEAN RUSSIA'S GOING TO ADMIT IT.
YOU BLAME RUSSIA FOR THE RECENT CURRENT EVENTS? WE CALL YOUR PRESIDENT A WUSS UNLIKE OUR TRUE LEADER, VLADIMIR PUTIN.
Jon: YOU SHUT UP, LANA. I AM SO SICK OF HER AND RUSEV TRASH TALKING AMERICA. AND SURE, MAYBE THEY BEAT JACK SWAGGER LAST NIGHT, BUT THAT WAS A COUNT-OUT, IT WASN'T EVEN A REAL PIN. AND SWAGGER'S BEEN OFF HIS GAME ANYWAY. EVER SINCE TAG-TEAM PARTNER ANTONIO CESARO TURNED ON HIM AND ABANDONED THE REAL AMERICANS TO GO SOLO AS THE THE KING OF SWING, BUT CESARO WAIT UNTIL SUMMER SLAM BECAUSE JACK IS -- [LAUGHTER] WRONG ROOM? [CLEARS THROAT] WELL, WATCH OUT, PUTIN, BECAUSE AMERICA HAS SOMETHING THAT NO PROPAGANDA CAN DEFEAT, THE MORAL HIGH GROUND.
ONE RUSSIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER EVEN SNIPED AT THE U.S. ON TWITTER, "THE WHITE HOUSE HAS FOUND GUILT BEFORE ANY INVESTIGATION, JUST LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN AND HIS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION." [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE MARK. YOU INVADE ONE COUNTRY UNDER A PRETEXT THAT YOU LEARN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WAS FALSE AND THEN QUIETLY CHANGE THAT PRETEXT AND PRETEND LIKE YOU NEVER MADE THE MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEY NEVER LET YOU FORGET IT. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW WHAT FINE, WE DON'T NEED YOU, RUSSIA, OR HOW DANGEROUS YOU MAKE UKRAINIAN AIR SPACE. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO.
THE AIRLINE REROUTED A FLIGHT FROM KUALA LUMPUR TO LONDON. IT COULD NOT USE THE USUAL ROUTE OVER UKRAINE FOLLOWING THE DOWNING OF FLIGHT 17. SO THE AIRLINE REROUTED THE FLIGHT OVER SYRIA, THAT IS, AS YOU KNOW, ANOTHER WAR ZONE. [AUDIENCE REACTING].
Jon: YEP. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE WORLD. WHEN THE AREA ABOVE AN ONGOING CIVIL WAR THAT'S KILLED TENS OF THOUSANDS AND INVOLVED THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS KNOWN AS "THE COMMUTER LANE." WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
