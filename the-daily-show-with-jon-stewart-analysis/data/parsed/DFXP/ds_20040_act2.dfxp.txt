( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THE HOLIDAYS ARE HERE. IT'S THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. BUT SADLY, SOME ARE NOT SO JOLLY THIS YEAR, INCLUDING THOSE WHOSE VERY JOB IT IS TO BE JOLLY. JORDAN KLEPPER HAS MORE.
THIS PAST SATURDAY, THE STREETS OF NEW YORK ECHOED WITH VOICES RAISED AGAINST INJUSTICE. AND CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY NORMAN SIEGELL THINKS THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD.
EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE CONTENT OF THE MESSAGE OF A GROUP, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS THAT VIEWPOINT.
AND SO HE STOOD WITH THEM-- NO, NOT THAT THEM. THIS THEM. HOLY ( BLEEP ). HE'S WITH SANTAS?
YOU CAN'T BAN PEOPLE FROM WALKING ON THE PUBLIC STREETS.
TURNS OUT SIEGEL IS DEFENDING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF SANTACON A DRUNKEN CHRISTMAS THEMED BAR CRAWL IN NEW YORK FACING UNJUST DISCRIMINATION BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN INDECENT BEHAVIOR AND THEIR YULE TIDE STREET BRAWL. SO I TRAVELED TO SANTA-CON TO BEAR WITNESS TO THEIR STRUGGLE.
HELL, YEAH, I FEEL PERSECUTED AS A SANTA. I'M DRUNK AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO WHATEVER THE ( BLEEP ) I WANT.
RIGHT. YOU MAKE A VERY ELOQUENT POINT.
HELL YEAH, I DO.
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE FUN!
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS WHO SAY THIS IS JUST AN EVENT FOR DRUNK KIDS FROM NEW JERSEY?
I'M FROM NEW JERSEY.
NEW JERSEY? I THINK THAT'S WRONG.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
NEW JERSEY.
SANTA HAS RIGHTS! SANTA HAS RIGHTS!
DOORS AND CHIMNEYS HAVE BEEN SLAMMED IN THEIR FACE. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN KICKED OUT OF A BAR?
YEAH, I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT OF A BAR.
JUST FOR BEING A SANTA.
FOR PEEING IN THE HALLWAY AND HAVING SEX ON THE POOL TABLE.
SO YOU GOT KICKED OUT OF A BAR BECAUSE YOU WERE A SANTA?
NO BECAUSE THIS GIRL WAS STARING AT ME AND I WAS LIKE WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME AND I HAD TO ( BLEEP ) HIT HER.
SO I SOUGHT OUT SIEGEL'S RIGHT HAND BEARD, AND THIS SANTA-CON ADVOCATE AGREED TO DISCUSS THEIR CAUSE-- IF HE COULD REMAIN IN COSTUME. SO-- WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?
SANTA, PLEASE.
SO I CAN USE THE "S" WORD? IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT COMMUNITY CAN USE WITH EACH OTHER?
YOU CAN USE THE "S" WORD?
WHAT UP, MY SANTA?
YO.
NICE. WHAT ARE THE OTHER GUYS IN SUITS CALLED?
THEY ARE ALL SANTA. WE ARE ALL SANTA.
DOESN'T THAT GET CONFUSING?
NOPE.
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SENDS A TEXT THAT'S LIKE, "SANTA, CAN'T COME TO SANTA'S PARTY BECAUSE SANTA HOOKED UP WITH SANTA AT SANTA'S BAR MITZVAH."
SANTA IS ALL OF US.
I'M JUST, I'M GETTING -- WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW? OH, YEAH, WE'RE TALKING SANTAS AND THEIR SACRED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
WE HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO GET TOGETHER, SAY WHAT WE WANT, AND WALK AROUND IN THE STREETS, AS LONG AS WE'RE DOING NOTHING ILLEGAL.
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE JUDGED, NOT BY THE VOMIT IN YOUR BEARD BUT BY THE CONTENT OF YOUR CHARACTER.
ABSOLUTELY.
WELL, THOUGH TO BE FAIR, VOMIT IN BEARD PROBABLY SPEAKS SOMEWHAT TOWARDS THE CONTENT OF CHARACTER.
30,000 OF ANYBODY, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME DRUNKS.
THERE ARE SOME BAD EGGS.
ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT'S THEIR NAMES?
NOBODY AT SANTA-CON IS TAKING NAMES.
YOU DON'T HAVE A LIST OF WHO'S BEING NAUGHTY? ( LAUGHTER ).
NO.
ISN'T THAT YOUR WHOLE ( BLEEP ) THING?
WE ARE NONJUDGMENTABLE.
SADLY, EVEN TRADITIONALLY PRO-SANTA NEW YORKERS HAVE HAD ENOUGH. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SANTA?
THEY SMELL BAD.
WHAT IS SANTA SUPPOSED TO SMELL LIKE?
CLEAN.
AND EVEN HIS LITTLE HELPERS WERE LESS THAN SUPPORTIVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SANTA?
( BLEEP ) SANTA. ( BLEEP ) THE NORTH POLE, MAN. I WOULD RATHER WORK IN A CHINESE IPHONE FACTORY THAN WORK ANOTHER DAY FOR THAT DOUCHEBAG.
SO ARE YOU A REAL ELF?
YEAH.
BUT PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T JUDGE A SANTA UNTIL I HAVE WALKED A MILE IN HIS BUCKLED BOOTS. AND AS I WAS VISITED BY THREE CHRISTMAS SPIRITS AND A FEW BUD LIGHT LIMES, IT HAPPENED. IT'S A MIRACLE, THEY SAY. MY HEART AND LIVER GREW THREE SIZES THAT DAY. WOW, INTENSE. AS THE LIQUOR FLOWED AND FLOWED, MY EMPATHY GROWED AND GROWED. I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD, THE HATRED AND OPPRESSION THESE SANTAS EXPERIENCED WHEN THEY WERE ( BLEEP ) FACED DRUNK IS ALL TOO REAL, EVEN AT A LOCAL BAR.
ONE MORE WHISKEY.
IT OPENED MY EYES.
SO WHAT. ( BLEEP ) AN ELEVATOR. DOES THAT MAKE ME A MONSTER? AM I A MONSTER?
YES!
( BLEEP ) YOU. AND ( BLEEP ) YOU. ( BLEEP ) YOU.
SO, KIDS, ON THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, BEFORE YOU HANG THE STOCKINGS WITH CARE, IT WON'T KILL YOU TO TAKE CARE OF PAPA SANTA. MAYBE A BURRITO, SOME GO JUICE. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME. HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A ROUGH NIGHT.
Jon:  VERY NICE. JORDAN KLEPPER. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
