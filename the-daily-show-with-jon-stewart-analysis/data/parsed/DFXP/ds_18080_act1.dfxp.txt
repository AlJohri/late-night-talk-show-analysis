FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD  NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. ["DAILY SHOW" THEME SONG  PLAYING] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY  SHOW". MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD PROGRAM TONIGHT. WE'VE GOT A GREAT ONE. OUR DWEFT TONIGHT IS AN AUTHOR  AND THE FACEBOOK COO SHERYL  SANDBERG. SHE HAS A NEW LOOK "LEAN IN."  THE STUDY OF BODY LANGUAGE  STRATEGIES. I'LL BE DOING THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] MEANWHILE GREAT NEWS FROM  WASHINGTON. CONGRESS RECENTLY PASSED AND  PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED A  CONTINUING RESOLUTION TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT ALL THE WAY  THROUGH SEPTEMBER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OUR GOVERNMENT -- OUR GOVERNMENT  IS NO LONGER LIVING MONTH TO  MONTH. WE'RE NOW LIVING SIX 340S TO SIX  MONTHS. [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THAT?
BURIED DEEP WITHIN THE PAGES  OF THAT BILL IS A CONTROVERSIAL  PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD KEEP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM  BANNING THE SALE OF GENETICALLY  MODIFIED FOODS.
Jon: WHAT THE -- WAIT --  WHAT? WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT  SENATOR POPPING J. CORNARMS? [LAUGHTER] I WANT YOU GUYS TO ALL BE READY  FOR THIS NEXT ONE AND LET ME  APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. YOU KNOW HE IS A RETIRED KERNEL. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S OKAY, I'LL LET MYSELF OUT. IT DOESN'T KEEP THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT FROM BANNING THE  GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS BUT IF THERE'S A COURT CHALLENGE OR  INJUNCTION ON THE SELLING OF  FOODS, THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE HAS TO ALLOW A  COMPANY LIKE MONTSANTO, IF THEY  WANT, TO CONTINUE SELLING THE  CROP. THE REPEALING SOYBEANS, YOUR  MEAT CARROT, YOUR TOMATO THAT  WILL THROW ITSELF AT BAD  ENTERTAINMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] LET'S AT LEAST HEAR SOME OF  CONGRESS'S NO DOUBT ROBUST  DISCUSSION ON THIS CONTROVERSIAL  AMENDMENT.
CRITICS ARE ANGRY BUT HOW IT  WAS PASSED. SNUCK INTO A HUGE AGRICULTURAL  BILL WITHOUT REVIEW BY A  COMMITTEE. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: SOMEONE JUST ATTACHED  THIS LANGUAGE PROTECTING  GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD MAKERS INTO A BIGGER UNRELATED BILL  LIKE THE SAME WAY IF YOU WANTED  TO BUY A PARTICULARLY NASTY PORNO YOU MIGHT SLIP IT UNDER  SOME -- LET ME GET SOME MOUNTAIN  DEW AND FALL HER'S ALMANAC AND MAYBE TO THROW EVERYONE OFF THE  SCENT WHAT ARE THOSE FLEET  ENEMAS? I'LL TAKE THOSE AND PROTECTIONS  FOR THE AGRA BUSINESS. PUT IT IN A BAG. HOW DOES CONGRESS LET THIS  HAPPEN?
THE LAW PASSED BOUT MOST OF  CONGRESS EVEN KNOWING ABOUT IT. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: CONGRESS DIDN'T KNOW  ABOUT A LAW THEY THEMSELVES  PASSED? SO CONGRESS IS NOW OPERATING  WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF SELF  AWARENESS AS A FLATULENT  GRANDPA. WHAT? WHAT? WHERE IS EVERYBODY GOING? [LAUGHTER] WHAT IS THAT? IF ONLY ONE LAWMAKER HAD CALLED  OUT THE SO CALLED MONSANTO  AMENDMENT PUBLICLY, BROUGHT IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE OTHER  LAWMAKERS SAIRK A SENATOR FROM  MONTANA JOHN TESTER.
THE SECOND PROVISION SENT  OVER FROM THE HOUSE TELLS THE  USDA TO IGNORE ANY JUDICIAL RULING REGARDING THE PLANTING OF  GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS. THEY ARE GIVEAWAYS PURE AND  SIMPLE. THEY DESERVE NO PLACE IN THIS  BILL. WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB ON  POLICY AND PROCESS.
Jon: I SEE THE PROBLEM  HERE:  THE OTHER LEGISLATORS  DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE SENATOR TESTER BROUGHT IT UP ON  THE SENATE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL  OF THEM. PERHAPS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT IN  THE MEMO FIELD OF A MONSANTO  LOBBYIST CHECK PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT. [ LAUGHTER ] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BILL NOBODY  KNEW ABOUT?
TUCKED AWAY IN THE CONTINUING  RESOLUTION ARE HIDDEN ITEMS ON  GUNS MAKING PERMANENT SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO REGULATE  GUNS.
Jon: IT'S GREAT TO SEE  CONGRESS IS MAKING PROGRESS ON  THE ISSUE OF GUN CONTROL CONTROL  S. [LAUGHTER] JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY GIVEN THAT  SENATORS CAN HOLD PIECES OF  SLAITION AND FILIBUSTER APPOINTOS -- APPOINTEES AND THIS  IS THE GENERAL LAW MAKING BODY.
I BELIEVE THE SENATE OUGHT TO  SLOW THINGS DOWN.
WE NEED MORE DEBATE IN A WAY  THAT DOESN'T RUSH IT.
SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND  WORK IT THROUGH.
AMERICANS WANT US TO TAKE OUR  TIME AND GET THINGS RIGHT.
Jon: YEAH. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S (bleep) WE NEED. WHY COULDN'T ANYONE PREVENT THE  WEIRD AMENDMENTS FROM HAPPENING?
THEY SAID IF THEY WANTED TO  KEEP THE GOVERNMENT FROM  SHUTTING DOWN THEY NEEDED TO GET THIS THROUGH. THERE WAS NO TAKE IT OUT.
Jon: RIGHT BECAUSE THIS WAS  A REDZ LIEWTION THAT KEPT IT  FUNDED FOR SIX MONTHS. IT HAD TO GO THROUGH. NOW THAT YOU HAUTE THE  AMENDMENTS VERSUS WHAT WE NEED. IN THE REPORT INFRASTRUCTURE  REPAIR. SUNDAY REPORT, ANYTHING. WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING. AFTER HEARING THIS YOU MAY BE  THINKING TO YOURSELF JON I'M NOT  COMPLETELY ANGRY AND UPSET. MAY I? [LAUGHTER] ARE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT THE SNEAKY  BASTARDS DOING THE DIRTY WORK OF  THE AGRA BUSINESS LOBBY? IT TURNS OUT IT WAS SLIPPED INTO  THE LEGISLATION ANONYMOUSLY [AUDIENCE REACTS] OOOOH SAYS THE  AUDIENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] IT TURNS OUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS  INVOLVED IN WRITING A BILL WHILE  THE BILL IS IN SUBCOMMITTEE ARE ALLOWED TO ADD ANY PROVISION  THEY WANT ANONYMOUSLY, NO  FINGERPRINTS. THE LAWS OF THE MOST POWERFUL  NATION ON EARTH ARE WRITTEN WITH  THE SAME LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS INTERNET COMMENTS. NO, NO, THAT'S NOT FAIR,  INTERNET COMMENTS HAVE AN IP  ADDRESS AND THEY ARE RELATIVELY  TRACEABLE. NONE OF THIS WOULD BE SURPRISING  IF WE PAID CLOSER ATTENTION ON  SATURDAY MORNINGS GROWING UP. ♪ I'M ONLY A BILL AND I'M  SITTING HERE ON CAPITOL HILL ♪
I'M JUST A BILL I DON'T WANT  ANY TROUBLE. MONSANTO. THAT'S EXIT ONLY FELLA! OW! CONGRATULATIONS NOW YOU ARE A  LAW.
DEMOCRACY HURTS MY ASS.
Jon: CONGRATULATIONS LAW,  WE'
