FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW. I'M JON STEWART. WE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, KEIRA KNIGHTLEY, HOST OF THE NEWS PARODY "THE KNIGHTLEY SHOW." I SHOULD JUST GO NOW. I'M SORRY. [LAUGHTER] LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH SOME IMPORTANT PRIMARIES. REPUBLICAN SENATOR THAD COCHRAN OF MISSISSIPPI AND DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE RANGEL OF HARLEM, 160 YEARS OF LIFE BETWEEN THEM, 86 OR THOSE YEARS IN ELECTED OFFICE, AAAAHHHH -- IF THEY WERE ONE MAN, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN IN 1854. ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN 1928. THEY WOULD HAVE DIED IN 1944 AND STILL HELD OFFICE FOR 70 MORE YEARS. [LAUGHTER] AND THEIR NAME WOULD HAVE BEEN THARLY COCKANGEL OF THE MISSISSIPPI HARLEM COCKANGEL'S AND THE BASIS FOR THE HIT TV SHOW, "THARLY'S COCKANGEL'S." "HELLO, HELLO THARLY." "HELLO COCKANGELS." BOTH MEN FACED SERIOUS PRIMARY CHALLENGES. AND BOTH MEN, ODDLY ENOUGH, WERE BAILED OUT BY AFRICAN AMERICANS. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S "DEMOCALYPSE 2014: ALWAYS BET ON BLACK." [LAUGHTER] OBVIOUSLY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT IN CHARLIE RANGEL'S HARLEM AND BRONX DISTRICT, BUT THIS YEAR EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE THE 22-TERM INCUMBENT -- 22-TERM INCUMBENT -- HIS INCUMBENCY CAN NOW LEGALLY DRINK. THE 22-TERM INCUMBENT, AN INVENTOR OF THE FAMED FRONT PANT AIR BAG TECHNOLOGY. HELLO, I'M CHARLIE RANGEL. DO YOU WISH THE FRONT OF YOU LOOKED MORE LIKE THE BACK OF YOU? [LAUGHTER] BUY MY FRONT BUTT PANTS. ANYWAY, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? OH, YES, THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TURNOUT MATTERED VERY MUCH BECAUSE RANGEL'S DISTRICT HAS A LARGE DOMINICAN POPULATION NOW, WHICH RANGEL FELT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIS CHALLENGER, ADRIANO ESPAILLAT.
HE WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND FOUND OUT THERE WERE MORE  DOMINICANS IN THE BRONX AND HIS AMBITIONS ALLOWED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE SHOULD BE FIRST DOMINICAN. JUST WHAT THE HECK HAS HE DONE BESIDES SAYING HE'S A DOMINICAN? [LAUGHTER]
Jon: YES, LIKE MOST OLD MEN, CHARLIE RANGEL IS RACIST. AND I'M ASSUMING LIKES SOUP. RANGEL WON. HE BEAT ESPAILLAT. BUT, OF COURSE, HE APPARENTLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN HE WANDERED OUT ONTO THE STAGE IN FRONT OF HIS SUPPORTERS TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON ... FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE HAVE YOU HAD REPORTED THAT'S IN? DO YOU KNOW WHAT PRECINCT LOCATION THEY ARE? I'M AT WHAT?
48.
48. SO THAT MEANS 20%...
49%/42%.
49%/42%. AND I'M UP. WE ARE UP, SO.
49% TO 42%.
49%/42%.
YES, SIR. AND YOU'RE UP.
AND I'M UP 49%/42%. WHAT SHOULD I DO?
Jon: I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. WELL, I THINK NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] WE ALL KNOW NOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO TO THE MOVIES WITH CHARLIE RANGEL. "WHAT? WHY? WAIT. WHO IS THIS? WHO IS THIS SITH LORD AND WHO IS THE... WHY IS THIS ONE SWORD BLUE BUT THE OTHER'S RED? WAIT THEY'RE BROTHER AND SISTER, WHY ARE THEY KISSING?" HOW LONG WAS CHARLIE RANGEL ON STAGE? LONG ENOUGH FOR THE EARTH TO SHIFT. [CHEERING]
THE PEOPLE HAVE WON. AND IF YOU CAN JUST HAVE THE CAMERAS SWEEP OVER --
WHOA.
Jon: WRAP IT UP! DO YOU NEED MORE OF A HINT? THE EARTH'S TECTONIC PLATES ARE TRYING TO PLAY YOU OFF STAGE. [LAUGHTER] SO TWO MORE YEARS FOR CHARLIE RANGEL TO CONTINUE TO PAY OFF HIS DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TIMESHARE  -- I MEAN REPRESENT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NEW YORK. OF COURSE, IN MISSISSIPPI'S REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY, BEING DOMINICAN, LESS OF AN ISSUE. THERE VOTERS HAD TO CONSIDER THE HARD CHOICE OF WHETHER ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN THAD COCHRAN OR TEA PARTY CHALLENGER CHRIS McDANIEL WERE BETTER SUITED TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH THE PRESIDENT. [LAUGHTER] IT WAS AN IMPORTANT RACE, BUT NOT AS IMPORTANT AS PEOPLE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE.
"TIME" MAGAZINE CALLS IT "THE BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE G.O.P."
NOT ONLY WILL THE EYES OF THE NATION BE ON THIS ELECTION TOMORROW, BUT THE EYES OF THE WORLD WILL BE ON THIS ELECTION.
Jon: YES. IF THERE IS ANY EVENT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD IS WATCHING, IT'S THE MISSISSIPPI REPUBLICAN SENATE PRIMARY RUN-UP. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING, AROUND THE GLOBE PEOPLE HAVE GATHERED TO WATCH WITH BATED BREATH, HERE COME THE EARLY RESULTS. THERE IS NOTHING... THERE IS NO... OOOOOH! IT'S THAD COCHRAN, COOOOOOOOCHRAN! THAD COCHRAN DEFEATED McDANIEL, WHO WON THE INITIAL PRIMARY BUT NOT BY ENOUGH TO AVOID A RUN-OFF. SO HOW DID COCHRAN BEAT HIM?
COCHRAN RELIED ON BLACK DEMOCRATS TO PUT HIM OVER THE TOP.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THAD COCHRAN WON THE MISSISSIPPI REPUBLICAN PRIMARY BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF BLACK DEMOCRATS. BEFORE YOU JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BLACK DEMOCRATS THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THAD COCHRAN, LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A TASTE, JUST A TASTE, A SOUPCON OF HIS OPPONENT, McDANIEL.
CHRIS McDANIEL APPARENTLY SAID THAT THERE'S NO PLACE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING OF SCHOOLS HERE IN MISSISSIPPI.
IF THEY PASS REPARATIONS AND MY TAXES GO UP, I AIN'T PAYING TAXES.
McDANIEL HAS ALREADY KEYNOTED A NEO-CONFEDERATE EVENT. HE'S RETWEETED WHITE SUPREMACISTS.
Jon: WELL, NOW, IN McDANIEL'S DEFENSE, THE WHITE SUPREMACIST'S TWITTER ACCOUNT HAD SOME EXTREMELY CUTE CAT VIDEOS. AH. HEY, EVERYBODY, LOOK. EVERYBODY, IT'S KITLER. YOU KNOW, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MEOW FUHRER. CLEARLY McDANIEL'S CANDIDACY CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN IN MISSISSIPPI'S AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. IS THERE ANY WAY McDANIEL COULD BEGIN HIS CONCESSION SPEECH THAT WOULD IN EVERY WAY CONFIRM THEIR CONCERNS.
LET ME JUST SAY THIS: WE FOUGHT. WE HAD A DREAM. [AUDIENCE REACTS].
Jon: OH, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF MY CHARACTER. AND SO IT IS THAT THE NATION'S AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE RETURNED THARLEY COCKANGEL TO CONGRESS FOR YEARS '87 THROUGH '94. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
