Jon: HEY EVERYBODY, THAT'S OUR SHOW. WHEN WE SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, WE'LL BE IN TEXAS. HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE. BUT FIRST, A FELLOW WROTE A BOOK ABOUT BEING IMPRISONED IN IRAN, IT CALLED, "AND THEN THEY CAME FOR ME." NOW THE BOOK IS BEING RERELEASED, IT'S CALLED "ROSEWATER," HIS NAME IS MAZIAR BAHARI. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE BOOK. IT'S COMING OUT TUESDAY, OCTOBER 21st. I'M NOT GOING THE READ IT. I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR THE MOVIE  BECAUSE I HEAR THAT'S GOOD TOO.  BUT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF  WORK.   I HOPE YOU GET A CHANCE TO TAKE LOOK  AT IT.   HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
FRANK, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE THIS?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
