[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WELCOME BACK. AS YOU KNOW, IN MARCH POPE  FRANCIS REPLACED POPE BENEDICT  XVI. WHILE JUST A LOOK AT THEIR TWO  FACES MIGHT HAVE PREPARED US FOR  A CHANGE IN TONE. NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTEDDED  HOW STARK THAT CHANGE WOULD BE.
WHAT WE HAVE GOING ON HERE IS  THE EMERGENCE OF THE KIND OF  PEOPLE'S POPE.
ANIMATED, RELAXED AND FUNNY. REACHING OUT, HUGGING AND  KISSING.
FROM PAYING HIS OWN HOTEL  BILL THE DAY AFTER HE WAS  ELECTED TO HIS LOVE OF THE CROWD, SURPRISE IS A HALLMARK OF  POPE FRANCIS.
John: SURPRISE IS A HALLMARK. THIS POPE IS A TOTAL PRANKSTER. LIKE HIS INFAMOUS "I GOT YOUR  SOUL RIGHT HERE."  ALL TIME HE PUT TABS OF ACID ON EVERYONE'S COMMUNION WAIVERS. THEY WERE SEEING GOD AFTER THAT. AND THE DEVIL. AND DRAGONS. YESTERDAY HE SURPRISED EVERYONE  YET AGAIN.
AN HISTORIC COMMENT BY POPE  FRANCIS ON THE SUBJECT OF  HOMOSEXUALITY.
THE POPE SAID IF A PERSON IS  GAY AND SEEKS THE LORD AND HAS  GOOD WILL, WHO AM I TO JUDGE THAT PERSON?
WELL, WELL. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
John: WHO AM I TO JUDGE THAT  PERSON? YOU ARE THE POPE. JUDGING PEOPLE IS BASICALLY WHAT  YOU DO. YOUR ENTIRE JOB DESCRIPTION IS  ONE ONE, WEAR A FUNNY HAT AND,  TWO, JUDGE EVERYBODY ELSE. LOOK, AS YOU WOULD EXPECT A  STATEMENT LIKE THAT DID NOT GO  UNNOTICED.
STUNNING REMARKS ABOUT  HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE PRIESTHOOD.
A CHANGE IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS  GAY FREEHS.
THE POPE'S WORDS RIPPLED  AROUND THE WORLD.
HISTORIC GROUND-BREAKING  STATEMENTS.
AN EXTRAORDINARY NEWS  CONFERENCE.
John: THIS IS THE BEST NEWS  FOR GAY CATHOLICS SINCE THEY  MADE AMUSEICAL ABOUT A SINGING  NUN. NOW, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THIS NEWS  HAS ROCKED THE HOLY SEE IN ROME. FOR MORE WE GO LIVE TO SENIOR  VATICAN CORRESPONDENT AASIF  MANDVI. ARE YOU THERE?
YO-HOO! YES, JOHNNY!
John: IT LOOKS LIKE... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. EASY THERE, BROTHER DOMINIC. HA-HA.
John: THE REMARKS HAVE BEEN  WELL RECEIVED THERE.
JOHN, THE RESURRECTION WAS  WELL RECEIVED. THIS IS AN ENTIRE CITY ORGASMING  AT ONCE. OKAY. TO PUT IT MILDLY, THERE ARE A  LOT OF GAY CLERGY HERE WHO HAVE  BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME TO COME OUT OF THE RIDICULOUSLY ORNATE  CLOSET. IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I AM OFF  TO JOIN THE CARDINALS IN THE HOT  TUB. YEAH!
John: THE VATICAN HAS A HOT  TUB?
YEAH! I THINK, JOHN, IT HAS A BIG  THING FULL OF WATER IN IT. IT'S A BIG STONE THING. COMING, BOYS.
John: THAT'S A BAPTISMAL  FONT. OKAY. ACCORDING TO ALL THE COVERAGE,  THIS WAS A MASSIVE DEAL FOR THE  CHURCH. NEW YORK'S CARDINAL DOLE AND  HEARD IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.
THIS IS NO WAY COULD THIS BE  INTERPRETED AS A CHANGE IN  CHURCH DOCTRINE. WHILE CERTAIN ACTS MAY BE WRONG,  WE WOULD ALWAYS LOVE AND RESPECT  THE PERSON. AND TREAT THE PERSON WITH  DIGNITY. HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT A SIN,  RIGHT? HOMOSEXUAL ACTS ARE.
John: OKAY. SO YOU CAN HAVE GAY DESIRES. YOU JUST CAN'T TAKE GAY ACTION. WHICH I GUESS MEANS THAT YOU CAN  LISTEN TO Y.M.C.A. BUT YOU MAY  NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES DO THE HAND GESTURES. AND BY THE WAY, THAT DOESN'T  MEAN THAT GAYS HAVE TO BE  CELIBATE. THERE IS A LOOPHOLE.
THE CHURCH'S TEACHING, WHICH  IS BASED ON THE BIBLE AND GOD'S  REVELATION, IS THAT SEXUAL LOVE IS RESERVED ONLY BETWEEN A MAN  AND WOMAN.
John: EXACTLY. GAY MEN CAN HAVE SEX AS LONG AS  IT'S WITH LESBIAN WOMEN. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A  LOVELESS MARRIAGE. JUST AS GOD NEARLY INTENDED. BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE  POPE'S REMARKS DIP AT LEAST MARK  SOME SORT OF CHANGE.
IT IS THOUGH A CHANGE IN  TONE. IT'S AN INVITATION FROM THE HOLY  FATHER THAT WE CAN NEVER BE  HARSH AND JUDGMENTAL.
John: SO THE POLICY IS THE  SAME BUT THE TONE HAS CHANGED. SORT OF LIKE IF SOUTHERN WATER  FOUND FOUNTAINS IN THE 1950s  CHANGED THEIR SIGNS FROM THIS TO  THIS. ACTUALLY, HOLD ON. IT'S JUST THE TONE IS NICER. BUT IS IT JUST THE TONE THAT HAS  CHANGED? I HAVE TO WARN SOMEONE. AASIF. AASIF. LISTEN, AASIF. IT WAS JUST A CHANGE IN TONE.
YES, I'M STILL IN ROME. John: , NO, NO, NO. AASIF, THE CHURCH HASN'T REALLY  CHANGED ITS POSITION ON  HOMOSEXUALITY. THOSE WERE FALSE REPORTS.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU SHOULD CUT THESE PANTS INTO  SHORTS.
John: THAT'S NOT JUST WHAT I  SAID. AASIF, CHURCH DOCTRINE STILL FOR  BIDS HOMOSEXUAL ACTS. THERE WAS NO CHANGE.
HOLY [BLEEP]. WHAT? OKAY. CUT THE BUBBLES. YES, CUT THE SMOKE. EVERYBODY, GET YOUR ROBES BACK  ON, YES. FIRE UP THE PLAIN SONG NOW. YES. JOHN, I HAVE TO RUN. THERE IS A STAMPEDE ALREADY FOR  THE CONFESSION BOOTH. AVA MARIA.
John: AASIF MANDVI, EVERYONE.
