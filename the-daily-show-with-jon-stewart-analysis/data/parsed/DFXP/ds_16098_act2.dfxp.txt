Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW. EARLIER TONIGHT WE SAW HOW THE DODD FRANK BILL HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DEBALLED BY A  COMBINATION OF LEGISLATIVE COWARDIST AND SHENANIGANS. THOSE AREN'T THE ONLY TWO WAYS TO SUBMARINE THINGS.
A BILL HAS BEEN REACHED IN THE SENATE TO PASS A 9/11 HEALTH-CARE BILL. THE LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE FREE MEDICAL CARE FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WHO ARE  SUFFERING HEALTH PROBLEMS AFTER WORKING AT GROUND ZERO.
Jon: IT TOOK NINE YEARS OF COMMITTED LEGISLATORS WORKING TIRELESSLY WITH  FIRST RESPONDER ADVOCATES, SOME OF THEM SADLY PASSING AWAY BEFORE THE BILL'S SIGNING TO BRING MUCH NEEDED  RELIEF TO THOSE WHO GAVE SO MUCH DOWN AT GROUND ZERO. FUNNY STORY. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AS IT TURNS OUT, AS PART OF A POLITICAL COMPROMISE, TO GET BILL-PASSED, THE BILL DOES  NOT COVER CANCER TREATMENTS. WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, I THOUGHT WE ALREADY TOOK CARE OF THIS  [BLEEP]. HOW DID WE NOT INCLUDE CANCER? THE BILL DOES COVER COUGHING, LARYNGITIS AND CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME BUT NOT CANCER. YOU GET SCURVY NO PROBLEMO. THESE LIMES ARE ON US. BUT THE ONE DISEASE THAT YOU SEEM TO DISPROPORTIONATELY BE GETTING, YEAH, WE CAN'T  HELP YOU THERE. IS THIS GOING TO BE FIXED?
THE ADMINISTRATOR SAID THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO PERIODIC REVIEWS FOR CANCER  AS NEW RESEARCH AND FINDINGS ARE RELEASED.
THE LINK BETWEEN 9/11 AND THE CANCERS THEN THEY WILL BE COVERED BY THE FUND.
Jon: PROVE THE LINK. SIR, CLEARLY YOU HAVE CANCER. AND CLEARLY YOU SPENT TIME SIFTING THROUGH CARCINOGENS IN SEARCH OF YOUR OWN LOVED  ONES AND COLLEAGUES AND THE COLLEAGUES OF ONED ONES AND YEARS BUT HOW DO I KNOW YOUR  CANCER ISN'T FROM-- IF YOU JUST GIVE ME 20 YEARS I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE  SOME STATISTICS ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT, I HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT THIS. WHO GIVES A [BLEEP] THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO HERE--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: THE WORST CASE, THE WORST CASE, THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO HERE IS WE  ACCIDENTALLY TREATED A 9/11 RESPONDER'S CANCER EVEN THOUGH HIS CANCER MAY NOT BE  PROVEN TO HAVE ITS GENESIS ON 9/11. HOW ABOUT EVERYONE WHO WORKED DOWN THERE ON FILE GETS A PASS ON THE EXACT ORIGIN OF THEIR PERSONAL TUMORS. SO IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO SPENT TIME ON THE PILE, I DON'T CARE IF YOU ATE 200  SWEET & LO PACKETS SPRINKLE ON YOUR FAVORITE CEREAL TUMOROS WHILE AREAING A CELL  PHONE SUIT AND SMOKING CHERNOBYL LIGHTS UNFILTERED WHILE MAKING YOUR FAVORITE  SNACK, AGENT ORANGE JULIUS, YOU GET CANCER, WE COVER IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
