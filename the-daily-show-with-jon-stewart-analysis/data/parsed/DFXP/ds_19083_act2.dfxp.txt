Jon: NOW -- WHILE WE AWAIT MORE NEWS ON THE TRUE SOURCE OF THE CORRUPTION IN NEW JERSEY'S REPUBLICAN-HELD GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- WINK [LAUGHTER] -- DEMOCRATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING DELICIOUS CORRUPTION-Y GOODNESS TO TIDE US OVER AS WE SEE IN TONIGHT'S SEGMENT INNOCENT UNTIL -- WHO ARE WE KIDDINGING? WE START IN NEW YORK CITY'S TOP FIVE BOROUGHS. QUEENS.
ASSEMBLYMAN WILLIAM SCARBOROUGH CONFIRMS AGENTS RAIDED HIS HOMES, HIS OFFICES AND A HOTEL ROOM HE USES AND LEFT WITH BOXES MARKED EVIDENCE.
Jon: OK, TWO THINGS. FIRST THEY RAIDED A HOTEL ROOM HE USES? THAT'S A BIT OF A TELL CRIME WISE UNLESS THE GUY REALLY LIKES EATING TOBERLONES IN THEIR NATURAL SETTING. AND SECONDLY, THEY WALKED OUT WITH BOXES LABELED EVIDENCE. WHY DID THIS GUY KEEP HIS STUFF IN BOXES LABELED EVIDENCE? THAT IS JUST DARING THE POLICE. SHOULD LABEL THE BOX NOTHING TO SEE HERE. MR. SCARBOROUGH, HOW DO YOU PLEAD?
WELL, I MEAN THEY ONLY GAVE ME A VERY SMALL SAMPLE OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT REPRESENTED THIS AND BASED ON THAT SMALL SAMPLE, I THINK IT'S VERY REFUTABLE.
Jon: BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT I HAVE DONE THAT THEY DIDN'T MENTION THE ACTUAL SCALE OF MY CRIMES IS SHOCKING. AND ALL OF IT REALLY IRREFUTABLE. DID YOU KNOW I HAVE A LAIR? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSEMBLYMAN LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH THE BIG BOYS. YOU HAVE TO GO MAYOR ON THIS.
THE MAYOR OF CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA HAS RESIGNED AFTER BEING ARRESTED DURING AN FBI STING. MAYOR PATRICK CANNON ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING MORE THAN $48,000 IN BRIBES. AND THEN SOLICITING ANOTHER $1 MILLION IN BRIBES.
Jon: THAT IS QUITE A JUMP. HE'S NOT JUST CORRUPT HE IS A TERRIBLE NEGOTIATOR. OK MR. MAYOR WE'LL GIVE YOU THE $48,000. MAKE IT A MILLION. WHY DID THIS GUY NEED THE MONEY ANYWAY?
REGARDING THE FIRST ALLEGED BRIBE CANNON TOOK, $12,500 IN RETURN FOR THE AGENT'S INVESTMENT IN HERS A FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCT THE MAYOR WANTED TO MARKET. [ LAUGHTER ]
Jon: KIND OF A LONG CON THERE. YES, I WAS ELECTED MAYOR BUT THE END GAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO BECOME THE DOUCHE KING OF NORTH CAROLINA. [ LAUGHTER ] I AM THE DOUCHE KING! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] THAT WAS WEIRD THAT MY BODY JUST CLICKED INTO THAT. I HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN ABOUT 20 YEARS. YOU KNOW THE SAYING. FIRST YOU GET THE MONEY, THEN YOU GET THE POWER, THEN YOU GET THE WOMEN TO BUY YOUR FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS. WANTING TO HELP WOMEN STAY FRESH IS NOT WORST THING A DEMOCRATIC POLITICIAN HAS DONE LATELY.
THE CALIFORNIA LAWMAKER WHO PUSHED FOR GUN CONTROL HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN A GUN TRAFFICKING SCHEME. THE STATE SENATOR LELAND YEE IS FIGHTING THESE CHARGES.
Jon: NOW WE'RE TALKING! TRYING TO STOP GUN TRAFFICKING WHILE TRAFFICKING GUNS. IT'S WHAT IS KNOWN IN THE BUSINESS AS A WIN-WIN. WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT AKS? SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIALS, SUNDAY MORNING LEFTOVERS. SNUB NOSED. THAT DIRTY HARRY GUN HE CALLED SALLY. I DON'T KNOW THE NAMES OF GUNS AT ALL.
THE FEDS SAY YEE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF ACQUIRING WEAPONS INCLUDING SHOULDER FIRED MISSILES FROM THE PHILIPPINES.
Jon: WHAT THE (bleep) IS THAT THING? IS THAT GUY -- IS THAT GUY SHOOTING SOMETHING OR REPLACINGING A WATER MAIN? WHAT IS THAT? I REALIZE GUN RUNNERS DON'T DO THE BACKGROUND CHECKS BUT HOPE THE FIRST QUESTION YEE ASKED THEM IS WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO BLOW UP THE MOON? [LAUGHTER] THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX LEVEL OF CORRUPTION. THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS GUY YEE WAS DOING THIS ALONE.
OTHER BIG PLAYER IN ALL OF THIS A MAN KNOWN AS SHRIMP BOY
Jon: OOOH, SHRIMP BOY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO MAKE US DIP IN COCKTAIL SAUCE. I'M JUST GETTING HIVES THINKING ABOUT.
A MAN KNOW AS SHRIMP BOY RAYMOND CHOW HE HAS A LONG CRIMINAL PAST, MURDER FOR HIRE, DRUG TRAFFICKING, ARSON, RACKETEERING. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: PLEASE ACCEPT MY HUMBLE APOLOGIZES YOUR SHRIMPNESS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT'S REALLY NOT A SHRIMP BOY HE IS REALLY MORE OF A SHRIMP MAN. LET'S GET BACK TO YEE WHO BEFORE BECOMING AN ILLEGAL WEAPONS DEALER HAD HIS SIGHTS ON BECOMING CALIFORNIA'S NEXT SECRETARY OF STATE.
COURT DOCUMENTS DETAIL MANY OF YEE'S CONVERSATIONS WITH UNDERCOVER AGENTS. HE SAID QUOTE DO I THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME MONEY? I THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME MONEY. DO I THINK WE CAN GET THE GOODS? I THINK WE CAN GET THE GOODS.
Jon: DO I THINK I'M BEING TAPED RIGHT NOW? I DON'T THINK I'M BEING TAPED RIGHT NOW. DO I THINK I'M GOING DOWN FOR THIS? I'M NOT GOING DOWN FOR THIS. IS SHRIMP BOY GOING DOWN FOR THIS? WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
