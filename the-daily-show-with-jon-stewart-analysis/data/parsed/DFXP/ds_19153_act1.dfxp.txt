FROM COMEDY CENTRALS WORLD NEWS HEAD QUARERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART ♪♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART! WE HAVE A NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU  THIS EVENING. OUR GUEST TONIGHT,  THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU,  BILL HADER WILL BE JOINING US, THE GREAT BILL HADER. HE'S GOT A NEW MOVIE OUT "THE SKELETON TWINS." BUT FIRST, WE HAVE UST RECEIVED SOME INCREDIBLE, EARTH SHAKING, SOME MIGHT SAY SHOCKING, BREAKING NEWS.
HILLARY CLINTON RETURNED TO IOWA SUNDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2008.
SHE ATTENDED SENATOR TOM HARKIN'S ANNUAL STEAK FRY.
WAS THIS A KICKOFF TO A POSSIBLE 2016 RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?
Jon: OH, MY GOD! (LAUGHTER) RETIRING DEMOCRATIC IOWA SENATOR TOM HARKIN HAS AN ANNUAL STEAK FRY! AND I'M ONLY HEARING ABOUT IT NOW? IN ITS 37th YEAR? ALL THOSE YEARS, SPINNING MY WHEELS AT SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN'S CRAWFISH BOIL...BARE THOSE CRAWFISH? (LAUGHTER) WHEN ALL THE WHILE A WONDERLAND OF FRIED BEEF WAS AWAITING ME IN A HEAVEN ON EARTH KNOWN AS INDIANOLA, IOWA. IF YOU SKILLET... IT WILL COME. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2016, WILLARY OR WON'TARY? (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT NOW LISTEN, OF COURSE THERE SECRETARY CLINTON HAD NOT SET FOOT IN IOWA SINCE HER DEFEAT IN THE IOWA CAUCUS IN 2008.
HELLO, IOWA! I'M BACK!
Jon: EVEN THOUGH YOU (BLEEP) ME OVER! I CAME IN THIRD BEHIND EDWARDS, YOU MOTHER (BLEEP)! EDWARDS! GRRRRR! WHERE'S MY STEAK! (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS A PANTOMIME OF PULLING OUT A PERSON'S HEART, LOOKING AT IT, TAKING A BITE, AND THEN DOWN. (LAUGHTER) COME ON, MRS. CLINTON, JUST TELL US IF YOU'RE RUNNING OR NOT.
IT IS TRUE, I AM THINKING ABOUT IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT FOR TODAY, THAT IS NOT WHY I'M HERE. (AUDIENCE REACTS)
Jon: BOY, THAT CROWD REALLY WEARS IT ON THEIR SLEEVE THERE, DON'T THEY? THEY REACT QUITE VISCERALLY TO EVERY STATEMENT. IOWA! I LOVE YOU! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) BUT I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU! (AUDIENCE REACTS) BUT I AM RUNNING! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) A WHITE SLAVERY RING. (AUDIENCE REACTS) AND NOW A SCREENING OF "STAR WARS" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE PHANTOM MENACE. (AUDIENCE REACTS) I DON'T KNOW WHY WE MADE... ALL RIGHT. SOMEHOW IN THAT BUILDING OF THE TRILOGY THERE, THE PHANTOM MENACE TURNED OUT TO BE A TOPPER TO WHITE SLAVERY RING WHICH PROBABLY SEEMS UNFAIR. I GUESS WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IF SENATOR CLINTON, SECRETARY CLINTON IS RUNNING.
IS SHE RUNNING? YES.
CLINTON KNOWS COMING HERE WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO TURN BACK.
ONCE SHE STEPS FOOT IN IOWA LATER TODAY FOR THE ANNUAL TOM HARKIN STEAK FRY, THERE TRULY IS NO TURNING BACK.
Jon: THERE IS NO TURNING BACK! (LAUGHTER) ABANDON! ABANDON HOPE, ALL YE WHO ENTER THE TOM HARKIN 37th ANNUAL STEAK FRY! FOR YOUR LOT IS CAST... YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT! OOM-WA, OOM-WA! (LAUGHTER) THAT WAS A RATHER SUDDEN YET UNCONVINCING STORM. (LAUGHTER) BUT IOWA WAS NOT ALL HILLARY ALL THE TIME.
VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS WAS ALSO IN IOWA THIS WEEKEND TESTING THE WATERS PERHAPS FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF HIS OWN IN 2016.
IS IOWA READY FOR HILLARY? ARE DEMOCRATS READY FOR HILLARY?
Jon: OH, FOR (BLEEP) SAKE! BERNIE SANDERS YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, FILLED WITH WISDOM THAT COMES WITH AGE, A DIOGENES FOR THIS MODERN ERA, ONE OF THE FEW INDEPENDENTS TO WIN A PLACE AT THE WASHINGTON TABLE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HILLARY CLINTON? WELL, IF THERE IS A QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING THE SENATOR, WE MAY AS WELL HEAR THE ANSWER.
WELL, I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT IOWA AND AMERICA DOES NOT WANT TO ANOINT ANYBODY. I THINK WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE --
Jon: POOR GUY CAN'T WIN. (LAUGHTER) STARTS TO GIVE A CONSIDERATE ANSWER AND GETS PHOTO BOMBED BY A SQUIRREL. (LAUGHTER) ALL RIGHT. NOW, HERE WE GO! COME ON! LET'S FOCUS! IT'S NOT THAT DISTRACTING! LET'S FOCUS.
I THINK WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CLEARLY WANT TO SEE IS A MAJOR DEBATE ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THE WORKING FAMILIES.
Jon: IT'S JUST REALLY (BLEEP) HARD TO FOCUS. YOU KNOW, GIVEN A CHOICE BETWEEN BERNIE SANDERS AND SQUIRREL! YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO GO WITH SQUIRREL! SO HILLARY MAY OR MAY NOT RUN, BERNIE MAY OR MAY NOT RUN. THE WHOLE DANCE IS SO CRUEL TO THE 24-HOUR MACHINE THAT IS FORCED CLOCKWORK ORANGE-STYLE TO WATCH IT.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST KIND OF OVER THIS WHOLE DANCE.
THIS ENDLESS DANCE. THIS ENDLESS WILL SHE OR WON'T SHE.
I THINK THIS COY FLIRTATION IS GETTING A LITTLE OLD.
DO WE REALLY THINK THAT SHE'S IN IOWA FOR THE STEAK? I MEAN, WHAT A CROCK! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN THERE! I'VE HAD THEY'RE STEAK! IT'S LIKE A COW TOOK A (BLEEP) IN YOUR MOUTH! (LAUGHTER) NO ONE WOULD YOU GO THERE FOR STEAK, I MEAN LET'S BE (BLEEP) REASONABLE! NOBODY'S MORE ANGRY ABOUT THIS THAN MSNBC'S OWN MORNING JOE SCARBOROUGH.
DO IT OR DON'T DO IT. WHAT HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO IS WHY AMERICANS HATE POLITICS. YOU GO AROUND ON A GLORIFIED BOOK TOUR WHERE YOU SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ASK YOU TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT SO YOU CAN SAY WE'RE NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. WE DON'T KNOW YET. THEN YOU GO TO THESE STUPID EVENTS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU EATING STEAK. IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN, JUST SAY YOU'RE GOING TO RUN AND STOP PLAYING GAMES! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: AND WHAT'S WITH TADPOLES? YOU'RE EITHER A FISH OR A FROG! PICK A SIDE! AND YOU OVER THERE, YOU, YEAH YOU. ARE YOU A LIZARD OR A ROCK? EITHER WAY! PICK UP THE PACE! YOU KNOW, NOT FOR NOTHING, MR. SCARBOROUGH. I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOUR BOOK, "THE RIGHT PATH" WAS MORNING PIMPED WITH A BIT OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN PATINA, AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY HAD A TOUCH OF INDECISION WITH IT AS WELL.
JOE SCARBOROUGH WENT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE THIS WEEKEND TO PROMOTE THE IDEAS IN HIS BOOK, "THE RIGHT PATH," BUT TALK QUICKLY TURNED TO 2016.
DID YOU JUST RULE OUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016?
NO, I'M NOT GONNA, I WON'T RULE ANYTHING OUT.
Jon: IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN, JUST SAY YOU'RE GOING TO RUN AND STOP PLAYING GAMES! (LAUGHTER) THE TRUTH IS, TO BE HONEST, THERE IS REALLY -- AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN IOWA RIGHT NOW THAT I'M INTERESTED IN. ROLL TAPE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NUTS TO WANT TO BE PRESIDENT! BUT IT HELPS! I'M A SQUIRREL AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE! (LAUGHTER)
Jon: SQUIRREL! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
