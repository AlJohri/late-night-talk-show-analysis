MARCH 5, 2012. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )     Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. TONIGHT'S GUEST SEAN DONOVAN THE PRESIDENT'S SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S RIGHT, PEOPLE. A MALE SECRETARY. OH, IT'S 2012. NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE NURSES. ANYWAY, ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET GOING HERE. WE BEGIN WITH A WARNING. I KNOW MANY OF OUR VIEWERS HAVE BUSY LIVES AND OFTEN USE THE TIME OF THIS PROGRAM TO  RECONNECT WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS FOR LAUGHING AND A LITTLE BIT OF A SEXY TIME. I KNOW A LOT OF YOU DO IT WHILE THE SHOW IS ON. TONIGHT YOU MAY WANT TO POSTPONE THOSE ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE WHILE THE SHOW WILL STILL BE EMPLOYING THE SPANISH FLY THAT IS A COMEDYIC TAKE ON  POLITICAL NEWS WE WILL BE MIXING IT THE ELECTRODES TO YOUR GENITALS THAT IS THIS CAT. HUMAN COLD SHOWER RUSH LIMBAUGH. SEE. AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW STUDENT TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT HOW SHE SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT  MANDATE FOR HEALTH INSURERS TO INCLUDE CONTRACEPTION AS PART OF WOMEN'S PREVENTIVE HEALTH  CARE RELATING TO HER OWN SITUATION UTILIZING BIRTH CONTROL AND A FRIEND WHO NEEDED IT FOR MEDICAL CONDITION. THESE WORDS WERE... I WILL PLAY FOR YOU. IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE AT HOME I SUGGEST YOU PUT IT ON NOW. GO AHEAD.
GEORGETOWN LAW STUDENT SANDRA FLUKE SAID IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE SEX IN LAW  SCHOOL WITHOUT MANDATED INSURANCE COVERAGE. WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE COLLEGE CO-ED SUSAN FLUKE WHO GOES BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL  COMMITTEE AND ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT SHE MUST BE PAID TO HAVE SEX? WHAT DOES THAT MAKE HER? IT MAKES HER A SLUT, RIGHT? IT MAKES HER A PROSTITUTE. SHE WANTS TO BE PAID TO HAVE SEX.
Jon: IS HE DONE? WOW! WOW, THAT ALMOST GOT ON ME. WHAT DOES HE MEAN? WHAT IS GOING THROUGH HIS FEVERED MIND GOING FROM A YOUNG WOMAN TRYING TO GET A  PRIVATE INSTITUTION... YOU HAVE TO MISUNDERSTAND SO MANY THINGS. HE SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT ANYONE USING CONTRACEPTION IS AUTOMATICALLY HAVING SEX AND  THAT CONTRACEPTION IS SOMETHING A WOMAN HAS TO PAY FOR EVERY TIME SHE HAS SEX. AND THAT THE WOMAN IS NEVERTHELESS BENEFITING FINANCIALLY FROM HAVING ALL  THAT DIRTY CONTRACEPTIVE DIRTY SEX. PERSONALLY I DON'T GET TOO WORKED UP ABOUT THE THINGS THAT RUSH LIMBAUGH SAYS  BECAUSE AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS A TERRIBLE PERSON. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  PRIOR TO THIS KURFUFFLE ANY  WOMAN CONCERNED WITH ISSUES THAT PERTAINED TO WOMEN'S HEALTH OR WORK IS IN RUSH'S  WORLD A FENI-NAZI. THAT'S HIS BASELINE FOR RHETORIC. THEY'RE FEMNI-NAZIS, SOMEONE WHO WOULD HERD YOU ON TO A TRAIN TO GO TO AN INDEPENDENT  GO GIRLS CONCERT. IT'S IS IT PARTICULARLY BIORUSH LIMBAUGH? OF COURSE. THAT'S LIKE SAYING THIS IS A PARTICULARLY PUNGENT BUCKET OF RAW SEWAGE MIXED WITH ROTTING  COW GUTS AND TYPHOID. HE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON. THE FUN PART IS WATCHING THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CONUNDRUM. AS HUMANS YOU WOULD EXPECT THEM TO REPUDIATE THE CALLING OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN WHOSE  ONLY CRIME IS TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS A SLUT OR A PROSTITUTE. BUT AS CANDIDATES....
I'M ASTONISHED THAT THE DESPERATION OF THE ELITE MEDIA SUDDENLY DECIDES THAT RUSH  LIMBAUGH IS THE GREAT NATIONAL CRISIS OF THIS WEEK.
HE'S BEING ABSURD BUT THAT'S AN ENTERTAINER CAN BE ABSURD.
NOT THE LANGUAGE I WOULD HAVE USED.
Jon: I WOULD HAVE SAID HUSSY OR TROLLOP OR... COURAGE. THEY TOO HAVE DECIDED THAT LIMBAUGH'S ONLY MISTAKE APPEARS TO BE SEMANTICS NOT REASONING. WHY DO THEY NOT BELIEVE HIS REASONING IS WRONG? BECAUSE THEY THINK THE SAME THING. YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU MY HARD-EARNED MONEY SO YOU CAN HAVE SEX. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR? GOOD BRIEF.
CRY ME A RIVER. NOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING FOR SOMEBODY TO HAVE SEX. IT'S NOT A RIGHT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO HAVE SEX.
YOU HAVE TO PAY $3,000 TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SEX WHENEVER I WANT IT. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PAYING THAT FOR ME.
WHATEVER.
Jon: WAIT. I DIDN'T THINK PRIESTS WERE ALLOWED TO BE MEAN. WHAT'S IT LIKE GOING INTO CONFESSION WITH THIS GUY? FORGIVE ME FATHER, I HAVE SINNED. WHATEVER! TWO THINGS, ALL RIGHT. TWO THINGS. ONE, THIS ISN'T ABOUT PAYING FOR WOMEN TO HAVE OR NOT HAVE SEX. IT'S ABOUT AN INSURANCE MANDATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT COVERING CONTRACEPTIVE  MEDICATION AS PART OF WOMEN'S OVERALL HEALTH CARE. TWO IT'S NOT YOUR TAX MONEY THAT PAYS FOR IT. IT WON'T GET INTO YOUR ROUND- ABOUT ARGUMENT ABOUT SOMEHOW MONEY IS TAKEN OUT OF YOUR  POCKET TO PAY FOR GEORGETOWN'S PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN WHOSE CONTRACEPTION COVERAGE WOULD  BRING INSURANCE RATES DOWN. I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY TAXES AT ALL. I'M JUST SAYING TO THE PEOPLE... CHEERDZ CHEERS I'M JUST SAYING TO THE PEOPLE  WHO ARE UPSET ABOUT THEIR HARD- EARNED TAX MONEY GOING TO THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE, WELCOME TO THE (BEEP) CLUB. EVERYONE, EVERYONE PAYS FOR (BEEP) THEY DON'T WANT TO ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT? REIMBURSE ME FOR THE IRAQ WAR AND OIL SUBSIDIES AND DIAPHRAGMS... (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  ... AND GUESS WHAT THEN? DIAPHRAGMS ARE ON ME. PROPHYLACTICS. PROPHYLACTICS ARE ON THE HOUSE. RENT GOOD FELLOWS. THERE'S ONE PERSON I FELT WOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.
STUDENTS CAN HAVE SEX ALL THEY WANT BUT DO THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO PLAY THE VICTIM WHEN  THEY DON'T GET ALL OF THEIR BIRTH CONTROL COVERED?
I DIDN'T GO BEFORE CONGRESS TO TESTIFY ABOUT... AND SOMEBODY NEEDED TO PAY FOR MY  BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.
DOES THIS WOMAN HAVE A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT THAT IS INDICATIVE OF A LARGER  ATTITUDE IN THE COUNTRY NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE, SOMEBODY ELSE IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE.
MEG AND KELLY DOESN'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT OR EMPLOYERS SHOULD EVER BE REQUIRED TO  SUBSIDIZE SOMEONE'S SEX... UNLESS....
THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE ADVANCED WORLD THAT DOESN'T ALLOW... THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE PAID MATERNITY. I HAPPEN TO WORK FOR A NICE EMPLOYER. WHAT IS IT ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT AND CARRYING A BABY NINE MONTHS THAT YOU DON'T  DESERVE A FEW MONTHS OFF SO BONDING AND RECOVERING CAN TAKE PLACE?
Jon: YOU KNOW WHERE THAT MATERNITY LEAVE CAME FROM, RIGHT? NINE MONTHS PRIOR? A LITTLE BOTTLE OF WINE. DVD COPY OF THE NOTEBOOK. IF YOU TOOK MATERNITY LEAVE AND EMPLOYERS WERE REQUIRED TO PAY THAT FOR YOU, WE PAID FOR  YOU TO HAVE SEX WHICH BY THE WAY, FINE, YOU DESERVE IT. YOU KNOW THE CREAM DE LaCREEPY DIDN'T COME TO END OF RUSH'S COMMENTS.
IF WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR CONTRACEPTIVES AND THUS PAY FOR YOU TO HAVE SEX, WE  WANT SOMETHING FOR IT. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. WE WANT YOU TO POST THE VIDEOS ONLINE SO WE CAN ALL WATCH.
Jon: OH, YEAH. NO, NO, NO. YOU PAY SO YOU GET TO WATCH. YOU KNOW WHAT? (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )  LET'S SEE WHAT YOUR MONEY BOUGHT.
CONTRACEPTION SHOULD BE COVERED BECAUSE IT CAN HELP PREVENT WOMEN FROM MANY  DIFFERENT MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT CAN HELP WOMEN NOT HAVE PAINFUL PERIODS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM GOING TO WORK OR  HEAVY PERIODS THAT CAN CAUSE THEM TO HAVE ANEMIA. CONTRACEPTION IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE FINANCIALLY BECAUSE IT HELPS UNBURDEN AN ALREADY  BURDENED HEALTH SYSTEM. IT CAN SAVE PATIENTS, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND MANY MANY DOLLARS SPENT UNNECESSARILY. (   CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: DID THAT WORK FOR YOU? DOES IT WORK FOR YOU? DO YOU NEED A LITTLE VIAGRA
