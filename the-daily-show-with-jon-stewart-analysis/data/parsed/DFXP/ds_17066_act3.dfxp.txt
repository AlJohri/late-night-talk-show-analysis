Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A JOURNALIST WHOSE NEW BOOK IS CALLED "THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE UNLIKELY  RISE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, MASHA GESSEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU? WELCOME TO THE SHOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS ENTITLED "THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE UNLIKELY RISE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN."  IS HIS RISE MADE MORE UNLIKELY FOR LACK OF A FACE? (LAUGHTER) IS THAT THE ISSUE THAT PUTIN HAS BEEN FACING?
I... FACING IT, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S CAPABLE OF IT, BUT, YES, HE WAS PLUCKED OUT OF NOWHERE IN 1999, COMPLETE UNKNOWN, CHOSEN BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT  YELTSIN'S INNER CIRCLE FROM A LINE OF OTHER FACELESS BUREAUCRATS. AND HE WAS BASICALLY AN ACCIDENTAL PRESIDENT WHO GOT INCREDIBLY LUCKY WITH THE RUSSIAN OIL BOOM.
Jon: WHY, THEN? WHY PUTIN? BECAUSE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF HIM IN THE BOOK IS HE DOES NOT COME OFF WELL. (LAUGHTER) THE FACE THAT WE SEE IS ONE OF A... GENERALLY WHAT SEEMS TO BE A THUGGISH INDIVIDUAL WHO  INTIMIDATES OPPONENTS. I MEAN, A REAL TYRANT. DID THEY SEE THAT IN HIM? DID THEY SAY "OOH, I LIKE THE CUT OF THAT FELLA'S JIB"? OR DID THIS ARISE OUT OF NOWHERE.
HE DIDN'T HIDE IT. BUT NOBODY WANTED TO SEE IT. AND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT PUTIN IS THAT HE SPENT BASICALLY HIS WHOLE LIFE IN THE K-BG SO HE  SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE IN SECRET SO HE GOT TO WRITE HIS OWN STORY WHEN HE BECAME A PUBLIC  POLITICIAN AND THE STORY HE WROTE IS ONE OF A STREET TOUGH, A THUG, SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T END A FIGHT, SOMEBODY WHO HAS TROUBLE CONTROLLING HIS TEMPER. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL HE TALKED TO HIS BIOGRAPHERS AND IN EARLY 2000.
Jon: WHEN HE SPOKE WITH THEM, HIS BIOGRAPHERS, WAS HE WEARING A SHIRT? BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT COMES UP OFTEN IS HE LIKES TO SHOW HIS OWN NIPPLES. (LAUGHTER) AND I... IT'S SURPRISING FOR A TYRANT.
RIGHT WELL T-SHIRTLESS THING BEGAN A LITTLE LATER. (LAUGHTER) THAT BEGAN IN 2005.
Jon: I'M SORRY. I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING ME ON SERIOUS TERMS. I THINK THAT'S... (LAUGHTER). I THINK THAT'S EXCELLENT. (APPLAUSE) WHEN IS THE ELECTION? WHEN IS HIS ELECTION?
HIS ELECTION IS ON SUNDAY, MARCH 4.
Jon: WHAT ARE THE ODDS MAKERS SAYING?
HE IS PLANNING TO WIN THE ELECTION IN THE FIRST ROUND. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: NOW, IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER PEOPLE TAKING TO THE STREETS IN  NUMBERS TO PROTEST VLADIMIR PUTIN?
YES. IT'S ACTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED, THE AMOUNT OF PROTEST. WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THIS HUGE SINCE BEFORE THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THIS SUSTAINED AND THIS MUCH OF A STREET MOVEMENT EVER.
Jon: DOES THIS DEMYSTIFY HIM? IF YOU REMOVE THE CLOAK OF INVINCIBILITY FROM PUTIN, DOES HE COLLAPSE? WILL HE... WHEREVER YOU SEE A BOOK THAT SAYS "THE UNLIKELY  RISE," YOU ALWAYS KNOW THE NEXT BOOK IS "THE LIKELY FALL."
I HOPE SO.
Jon: YOU DO. SO AFTER... YOU FEEL HE'S... HIS TYPE OF T +*EURNY... BECAUSE FOR  ME, BOY, TO RETURN TO THOSE COLD WAR SIMPLE DAYS. (LAUGHTER)
I UNDERSTAND. WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER THIS  IS GOING TO LAST.
Jon: YOU THINK HE'S... YOU REALLY THINK THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON VLADIMIR PUTIN.
I THINK SO. BECAUSE THE POWER STRUCTURE HE HAS BUILT RESTS ON FEAR AND PERSONAL CONNECTIONS AND MONEY  AND THE FEAR IS BEING TAKEN OUT OF THE EQUATION AND THAT MEANS THE WHOLE THING WILL COLLAPSE  AND I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN SOON.
Jon: HE IS NOT KIND TO HIS CRITICS AND THERE IS ALL KINDS OF-- AS WE SAY IN MY LANGUAGE--  MILITIA GOSS THAT GOES ON WITH PEOPLE THAT WRITE THAT. WERE YOU TREPIDATIOUS AT ALL TO TAKE THIS PROJECT ON? MILITIAS GO.
I TRIED TO KEEP IT SECRET THAT I WAS WORKING ON IT.
Jon: OKAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE ON TELEVISION. (LAUGHTER) I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS AIRS IN RUSSIA BUT...
RIGHT.
Jon: YOU ARE TALKING TO ME ON TELEVISION.
RIGHT. I'M AWARE OF THAT. (LAUGHTER) AND THE BOOK IS... (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW...
THE BOOK IS DUE TO BE PUBLISHED TOMORROW SO I DON'T  THINK I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP A SECRET FOR MUCH LONGER.
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE MAYBE THIS DOES HELP RETAKE CRITICAL MASS WHERE YOU  DEMYSTIFY THE DICTATOR TO THE POINT WHERE HE LOSES HIS POWER. YOU WRITE A LOT OF ANECDOTES OF HIS... HIS EARLY LIFE, EVEN THE WAY THAT HE PROPOSED TO HIS WIFE  IS SO REVELTORY.
IT'S AMAZING. THEY DATED FOR THREE YEARS HIS WIFE DESCRIBES THE PROPOSAL. HE SAID TO HER "WELL, WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR THREE YEARS SO YOU  KNOW THE KIND OF MAN I AM." AND SHE THOUGHT "WELL, HE'S  CLEARLY BREAKING UP WITH ME."
Jon: BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT KIND OF MAN HE WAS!
RIGHT. AND SO SHE SAID "YES, I KNOW WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU ARE."  HE SAID "IN THAT CASE, I'VE MADE A DECISION." AND SHE KNEW HE WAS BREAKING UP  WITH HER AND THAT'S WHEN HE SAID "LET'S GET MARE NEED A MONTH."  (AUDIENCE REACTS).
Jon: AND HE SAID "YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF MAN I AM."  AND HE LISTED THE KIND OF MAN HE IS.
RIGHT, NOT A NICE PERSON TO BE WITH, KIND OF INCONVENIENT, BAD AT EXPRESSING HIS EMOTIONS, AS HE WAS DEMONSTRATING.
Jon: THIS IS HIS PITCH TO THE WOMAN HE'S GOING TO MARRY. (LAUGHTER) I WONDER IF THE SHIRT WAS ON AT THAT TIME. I WONDER IF HE SAID ALL THAT AND HE SAID OKAY, BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE... YOU KNOW? IT IS... IT'S A REMARKABLE STORY. WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN A FEARED LEADER, HUMANIZING THEM IS SUCH A WEAPON IN A WEIRD WAY.
Jon: .
WELL, I FOUND IT HARD TO HUMANIZE HIM. (LAUGHTER).
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BUT REMOVING THEIR CLOAK OF INVINCIBILITY.
RIGHT. HE'S A SMALL GUY. HE'S A SMALL GUY IN EVERY SENSE AND I THINK THAT... (LAUGHTER). (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU ABOUT AMERICAN AUDIENCES. WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT GEOPOLITICS BUT INEWEN DOE... (LAUGHTER). IT REALLY IS AN INCREDIBLE PORTRAIT OF A LEADER THAT I THINK WE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON THE SHOW AND DON'T WORRY. THIS IS NOT A VERY WIDELY SCENE PROGRAM. (LAUGHTER) SO YOU'RE SAFER THAN YOU PROBABLY REALIZE. "THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE UNLIKELY RISE OF VLADIMIR PUTIN" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW. MASHA GESSEN. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
