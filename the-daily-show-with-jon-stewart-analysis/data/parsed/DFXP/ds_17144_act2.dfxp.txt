(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
Jon: WELCOME BACK. OUR GUEST TODAY... OH, YOU'RE VERY KIND. YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICANS FORMALLY ADAPTED THEIR TWELVE PARTY PLATFORM. IT'S BEEN HAILED AS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE PLATFORM IN MODERN  HISTORY IN THAT IT'S TRYING TO UNDO A GOOD DEAL OF MODERN HISTORY, INCLUDING BANNING  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, GAY MILITARY SERVICE, ANY AND ALL GUN RESTRICTIONS AND WOMEN IN COMBAT  BECAUSE THE BATTLEFIELD IS REALLY THE ONE PLACE WHERE WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE GUNS. UM... (LAUGHTER). BUT THE PLANK GETTING THE MOST ATTENTION IS THE ONE CALLING FOR A HUMAN LIFE AMENDMENT TO THE  CONSTITUTION WHICH WOULD IN ESSENCE BAN ABORTION EVEN IN THE CASE OF INCEST OR RAPE WHICH AS  WE RECENTLY LEARNED FROM TODD AKIN DOESN'T EVEN RESULT IN PREGNANCY BECAUSE RAPED WOMEN'S  BODIES AUTOMATICALLY GO INTO A MAGICAL SPERM-KILLING LOCKDOWN WHICH, ALTHOUGH YOU'RE SURPRISED  WHY THEY DIDN'T ALSO DEVELOP SOME KIND OF ANTI-PENILE TECHNOLOGY REALLY I THINK IS  PROBABLY IN THE R&D STAGE YOU WOULD THINK THAT AN INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED VAGINA  WOULD HAVE THAT. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE POINT IS THIS, MITT ROMNEY DISAGREES WITH THAT PLATFORM. SO HOW WILL THE DELEGATES RATIFYING THE PLATFORM REACT? OUR OWN SAMANTHA BEE FOUND OUT.
THE G.O.P. PLATFORM IS CLEAR: NO ABORTION, NO EXCEPTION. BUT THE G.O.P. CANDIDATE DISAGREES.
THERE SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONS IN THE CASE OF RAPE AND INSIST AND  WHEN THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER IS AT STAKE.
BUT HOW WOULD THE DELEGATES WHO RATIFY THIS PLATFORM RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCE.
I DO BELIEVE THE PLATFORM IS CORRECT THAT LIFE BEGINS WITH CONCEPTION BUT W NO EXCEPTIONS.
BUT MITT ROMNEY WOULD ALLOW FOR EXCEPTIONS.
CORRECT.
SO THAT'S OKAY FOR YOU?
IF THAT'S THE CHOICE HE MAKES, THAT'S HIS CHOICE.
HE IS AAY HOW WILLED TO CHOOSE. THIS MAN IS NOT A ROBOT.
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL ANYWAY.
I KNOW THE PERCENTAGE IS SO SMALL. SO SMALL OF A PERSON BECOMING PREGNANT FROM A RAPE THAT IT'S... I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW  IF THAT'S IN EQUATION BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT PERCENTAGE IS JUST LIKE... ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT CLOSE. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES.
YEAH, ABOUT... PROBABLY ABOUT 32,000 A YEAR.
IS IT 32?
THOUSAND. 32,000. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO WHY ISN'T MITT ROMNEY ACCEPTING THE PLATFORM? HE IS THE NOMINEE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY WELL LIVE IN AMERICA. IT'S UP TO ANY HUMAN BEING TO CHOOSE, TO DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEMSELVES.
IT IS ROMNEY'S CHOICE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE PLATFORM? WELL, OF COURSE. WHO ARE WE TO TELL SOMEONE HOW THEY SHOULD ACT?
WE ARE NOT FORCING GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO ACCEPT ANYTHING.
BUT SHOULD THEY? I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM UP THERE, HE WANTS THAT PLATFORM.
SURE, HE DOES.
THE MAN WANTS TO BE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN HIM UP THERE WITH HIS SALT-AND-PEPPER HAIR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. HE'S BEGGING FOR THAT PLATFORM.
I DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S EVER REALLY FORCED ON ANYBODY. I THINK...
OKAY, DON'T GO THERE. DO NOT GO THERE. AND BESIDES...
I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND THAT HE'S MADE THIS DECISION LIGHTLY.
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THAT DECISION UNLESS YOU'RE THE ONE IN THAT SITUATION.
YES. UNLESS YOU ARE IN THAT PROCESS, HOW CAN YOU MAKE THAT DECISION FOR SOMEBODY ELSE?
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE.
IT'S A REALLY PERSONAL ISSUE DECIDING WHAT PEOPLE'S PERSONAL ISSUES ARE.
IT CERTAINLY IS.
I'M GOING TO PLAY THE PLANK OF THE G.O.P. PLATFORM AND I  NEED YOU TO TELL ME WHY I MAY NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY AS A POLICY. PLEASE REFER TO ME AS "LIL PLATFORM."
LIL PLATFORM, THIS MAY NOT BE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MOMENT.
IT'S AN INCONVENIENT TIME FOR ME TO BECOME POLICY?
WE WILL CONSIDER YOU AT ANOTHER DAY IF THE TIME IS RIGHT.
WHEN THE TIMING'S BETTER.
YES, LIL PLATFORM. (LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE FOR THESE DELEGATES THERE'S ONE IDEAL THAT THRIVES ABOVE ALL OTHERS.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS A PURPOSE AND WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. AND THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT YOUR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES.
THAT'S WHAT OUR COUNTRY, THE INDIVIDUALISM. WE GET TO BE WHO WE ARE. I MEAN, EVERYBODY GETS TO CHOOSE THE PATH THAT THEY CHOOSE BECAUSE IT'S THEIR CHOICE.
EXSEPTEMBER IN THE CASE OF ABORTION.
BUT, THAT'S... UM...
MY RIGHT END WHERE MY UTERUS BEGINS.
I GUESS I'D HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT.
PERSONAL LIBBER CITY THE HALLMARK OF OUR CIVILIZATION, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
EXCEPT IN CASES OF ABORTION.
IN CASE OF ABORTION. EXACTLY. LAUGH.
SAY HELLO TO MY UTERUS. YOU OWN A LITTLE PIECE OF IT. HELLO! I BELONG TO EVERYBODY! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: SAMANTHA BEE, WE'LL BE RIGHT
