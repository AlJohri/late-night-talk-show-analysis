FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART!
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART. JIM PARSONS IS GOING TO BE JOINING US IN THE STUDIO TONIGHT. BUT FIRST, INDIA, A LAND OF TECHNOLOGICAL WIZARDS IS INDIA, COLORED POWDERS, BREAD THAT APPEARS TO NEED SAUCE AND CHEESE, A MYSTERIOUS AND EXOTIC PLACE UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF THE 1.3 BILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE, THEN YOU PROBABLY DON'T REDUCE IT TO ONE OF THE THREE CULTURAL STEREOTYPES THAT WE AMERICANS ARE AWARE OF -- OH, AND CRAZY SEX POSITIONS, FOUR STEREOTYPES. ANYWAY, THE POINT IS, INDIA HAD AN ELECTION. IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S DEMOCALYPSE 2014 SUBCONTINENTAL EDITION. NOW, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, INDIAN CAMPAIGN SEASON JUST STARTED HEATING UP.
AFTER FIVE WEEKS OF BALLOTING, VOTING IN INDIA'S MARATHON ELECTION IS NOW OVER AND THE COUNTRY WAITS TO SEE WHO WILL BECOME THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER.
AH OVER. I DIDN'T MEAN HEATING UP. I MEANT IT'S OVER. NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO WATCH ON INDIAN TV? I MEAN, IT'S MONTHS UNTIL THE NEW SEASON OF "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ARUNACHAL PRADESH." I REALLY, I REALLY HOPE I SAID THAT SOMEWHERE NEAR CORRECTLY. (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, THE RESULTS ARE NOT FINAL YET. WHO'S IN THE RUNNING?
LEADING THE RULING INDIA NATIONAL CONGRESS PARTY IS RAHUL GANDHI.
OOH, IT'S A GANDHI. CALL IT ALL, IT'S A GANDHI. HE HAPPENS TO BE THE SON OF PRIME MINISTER RAJIV GANDHI, GRANDSON OF PRIME MINISTER INDIRA GANDHI AND IN NO WAY RELATED TO THE ONLY GANDHI YOU'RE THINKING OF. BASICALLY, IT'S INDIA. PEOPLE ARE TRIPPING OVER GANDHIS. HOW DOES THAT GUY NOT WIN?
THE FRONTRUNNER FOR THE JOB IS NARENDRA MODI. >>HE'S THE LEADER OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY.
MODI IS THE CHIEF MINISTER OF THE STATE OF GUJARAT.
HE'S PROMISING THE COUNTRY STRONGER LEADERSHIP AND FASTER GROWTH.
WHAT HE DID IN GUJARAT IS JUST AMAZING, CHIEF MINISTER WITH 5% OF THE POPULATION HE CAPTURED 25% OF THE EXPORTS OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
IT'S A GUJARAT MIRACLE. EVERY EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL IN GUJARAT UPGRADED TO BEST, ALL THE SLUMDOGS IN GUJARAT NOW MILLIONAIRES. I'D LOVE,  I'D LOVE TO DO MORE OF THOSE JOKES, BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER MOVIES ABOUT INDIA. I'M SORRY. THIS GUY SOUNDS INCREDIBLE. ONCE AGAIN, I CONFIDENTLY DO NOT SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE.
IN 2002, MODI WAS CHIEF MINISTER OF GUJARAT WHEN RIOTS BROKE OUT THAT PITTED THE MUSLIM MINORTY AGAINST THE HINDU MAJORITY. AS MANY AS A THOUSAND MUSLIMS WERE KILLED. MODI WAS ACCUSED OF NOT DOING ENOUGH TO STOP THE VIOLENCE. THE U.S. REVOKED HIS VISA OVER IT. CAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FIND A PARTNER IN A LEADER THERE WHO WON'T BE ALLOWED IN THE UNITED STATES?
THAT DOES TEND TO STRAIN RELATIONS WHEN THE TWO LEADERS CAN'T BE IN THE SAME COUNTRY AT THE SAME TIME. ON THE UPSIDE, GREAT TEST-RUN FOR AMERICA'S NEW DRONE DIPLOMACY PROGRAM. BUT, MODI ASSURES VOTERS HE'S FOCUSED ON IMPROVING INDIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE NOT DIVISIVE RELIGIOUS POLITICS. A STANCE ENCAPSULATED IN HIS SLOGAN, THIS IS TRUE, "TOILETS NOT TEMPLES." OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT THE FIRST ONE THEY CAME UP WITH. THEY TRIED "CHANGE YOU CAN RELIEVE IN" AND, OF COURSE, THE ICONIC POSTER. THERE YOU GO. NO MATTER WHO BECOMES INDIA'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER, THEIR ELECTION WILL HAVE GLOBAL CONSEQUENCES. OUR OWN JASON JONES HAS MORE.
Jason: INDIA IS HAVING AN ELECTION. AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE TO VISIT. BUT I'D RATHER AVOID DYSENTERY IN 120 DEGREE WEATHER. SO INSTEAD I WENT TO THE INDIA CONSULATE IN NEW YORK AND MET WITH AMBASSADOR -- (MISPRONOUNCING NAME) -- I MET WITH THE AMBASSADOR. MR. AMBASSADOR, I AM NOT AT ALL EMBARASSED TO ADMIT THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT INDIA.
YEAH, WELL IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO START.
I HEAR YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A LITTLE ELECTION.
YES. INDIA IS ACTUALLY THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD.
NO, THAT'S THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT IS THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD.
NO, HOW DO YOU DEFINE IT?
Jason: OH, I DON'T KNOW, 121 MILLION PEOPLE VOTING IN OUR LAST ELECTION.
AND WE HAVE 814 MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS.
Jason: OK, BUT THAT'S, THAT'S, THAT'S IN RUPEES. HOW MANY IN AMERICAN?
I THINK WE DON'T CONVERT PEOPLE INTO RUPEES AND DOLLARS.
I KNOW WHY YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT US BECAUSE WE'RE THE BEST. BUT, WHY DON'T WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU?
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND INDIA IN ONE LIFE. A PERSON SAY FROM TAMIL NADU IN THE SOUTH WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE OF SOMEBODY IN THE NORTHEAST. MY WIFE OFTEN THINKS WHEN I SAY  NO, SHE THINK IT'S YES.
Jason: HOW DO YOU SAY NO?
I SAY IT LIKE THIS.
Jason: WHAT, YOU SAY NO LIKE THIS?
SO, NOW ACTUALLY YOU'RE CONFUSING ME. I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
Jason: YOU DON'T REMEMBER HOW YOU SAY NO?
AT ONE LEVEL INDIA IS VERY CONFUSING, AT ANOTHER LEVEL IT'S VERY, VERY FASCINATING.
Jason: WELL, AMBASSADOR, IF YOUR ELECTIONS ARE SO FASCINATING THEN WHY IS THIS ALL I CAN FIND ABOUT INDIA ON AMERICAN TELEVISION?
GOOD RICE, GOOD CURRY, GOOD GANDHI, LET'S HURRY.
THE COVERAGE HERE IS, I WOULD SAY, LOPSIDED. IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITY, IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THE ENTHUSIASM OF INDIAN PEOPLE. IT'S, IT'S, IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU MUST SEE TO BELIEVE.
Jason: PLEASE DO NOT DARE ME TO GO TO INDIA.
THIS IS REALLY A FASCINATING ELECTION.
Jason: DON'T MAKE ME GO TO INDIA.
NO, YOU MUST GO.
Jason: BUT, I DON'T WANT TO GO.
SITTING BEHIND A DESK IN THE U.S., AND APPRECIATING OR UNDERSTANDING INDIAN ELECTIONS IS ALMOST NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.
Jason: OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, PAL? I AM GOING TO GO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO TRAVEL TO INDIA.
YOU BETTER GO. YOU BETTER GO.
Jason: I'M NOT GOING.
YOU BETTER GO.
Jason: LUCKILY, I KNEW SOMEONE WHO LOVED INDIA. (KNOCKING) GUESS WHAT? WHO THE (bleep) ARE YOU?
HI, I'M JORDAN.
YEAH, I DON'T CARE. WHERE'S MANDVI?
HE'S HAS AN HBO SHOW.
Jason: WELL, GOOD NEWS. YOU ARE GOING TO INDIA.
OH, I CAN'T. I'M A RACIST.
Jason: JESSICA.
I CAN'T. I'M RACIST, TOO.
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO INDIA, HAVE A NICE TRIP.
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO COME TO INDIA. YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY HUNGRY. LET'S GO GRAB SOME CHILLED MONKEY BRAINS. IS THAT RACIST, BY THE WAY? (MUSIC)
OKAY, LET'S AVOID THAT CIVIL WAR. NO, NO, CAN'T FLY IN THEIR AIRSPACE. WHOA, TOO MANY DRONES THERE. THERE WE GO. DELHI. JUST ONE LOOK AT THE CHAOS OF INDIA'S CAPITAL CITY AND IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS NO WAY THIS DEMOCRACY COULD EQUAL OURS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE U.S. YOU ARE FREE TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO PARTIES AND IN INDIA YOU HOLY (bleep) THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICES. OK, BUT IN AMERICA, A STAGGERING 23% OF OUR YOUTH PLAN ON VOTING IN OUR NEXT ELECTIONS. MATCH THAT, INDIA.
AS YOU KNOW 60 YEARS WE HAVE BEEN WITH THE CONGRESS PARTY, WE'RE TRYING SOMETHING NEW THIS TIME.
SO, YOU'RE 15 YEARS OLD AND YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT POLITICS.
YES, WE DO BECAUSE IT IS OUR FUTURE.
REALLY? YOU GUYS ALL CARE ABOUT POLITICS?
YES.
YES, OF COURSE I CARE ABOUT POLITICS BECAUSE OUR FUTURE DEPENDS ON US SO WE CARE A LOT ABOUT POLITICS.
YOU CARE THAT MUCH YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT MOTORCYCLE.
YEAH.
WOW. AND WITH 150 MILLION FIRST-TIME VOTERS, MAYBE INDIA'S YOUTH IS A LITTLE MORE ENGAGED THAN OURS. BUT IN AMERICA, OUR POLITICIANS KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO EACH COLOR-CODED GROUP.
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU DADDY YANKEE.
WHO LET THE DOGS OUT? WHO? WHO?
SO, INDIA, DOES YOUR DEMOCRACY PANDER TO ITS MINORITIES? I'M LOOKING FOR MINORITIES -- PEOPLE WHO LOOK -- MINORITIES -- I DON'T KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR MINORITY HERE? HEY PAL, YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?
YES.
Jason: YOU DO. OKAY. WHAT'S UH, WHAT DO MINORITIES LOOK LIKE HERE?
YOU.
Jason: LIKE ME?
YES.
Jason: OH YES. WHY AM I ASKING THE QUESTIONS THEN? HERE, YOU TAKE IT. I'LL TAKE THAT. HERE, LET'S, LET'S SWAP THEM. JUST READ THEM.
WHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE SO FAT?
Jason: WHAT?
WHY ARE, WHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE SO FAT?
Jason: NO, I HEARD YOU. IT'S JUST VERY OFFENSIVE.
WHY ARE WHITE PEOPLE SO LAZY?
Jason: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT!
I HAVE 30 OTHERS, DO YOU WANT ME TO KEEP GOING?
Jason: NO. I DON'T WANT YOU TO KEEP GOING. IS THAT WHAT THIS INTERVIEW IS ALL ABOUT? TO MAKE ME LOOK FOOLISH AS A MINORITY? THE INTERVIEW IS OVER. BUT, THE REAL WORK IS BEGINNING. BECAUSE EVERYWHERE I WENT IN INDIA, EVERYONE HAD AN OPINION ON POLITICS.
EVERY PERSON'S ASPIRATION, EVERY SINGLE VOTE.
Jason: YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE ALL THAT BUT I'VE GOT A LONG,  LONG LINE OF GUYS I'VE GOT TO GET TO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. EVERYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Jason: OF COURSE, YOU ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS.
-- LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT. AND IN A COUNTRY WITH 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE, 780 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES AND 330 MILLION HINDU GODS, CUTTING THROUGH THE NOISE WAS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE.
Jon: JASON JONES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
