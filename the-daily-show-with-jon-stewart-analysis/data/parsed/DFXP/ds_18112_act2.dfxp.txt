IS.
Jon: HEY, WELCOME BACK. I'M HOPING YOU KNOW BY NOW  TONIGHT WILL BE MY LAST SHOW  UNTIL SEPTEMBER 4TH. I'M ACTUALLY LEAVING FOR I  THINK A VERY NOBLE REASON. I AM ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW  IF ANYBODY KNOWS THIS, AM  GETTING A MASSIVE PLASTIC VOOIRJ MAKEOVER. AND TURN THIS UGLY DUCKLING  INTO A BEAUTIFUL SWAN. ACTUALLY HERE'S WHAT I  BELIEVE I'LL LOOK LIKE WHEN  I RETURN, SO JUST YOU GET  USED TO IT. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  NOT REALLY SURE WHY I HAD  THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHILE I'M GETTING MY WORK  DONE THERE WILL BE A YOUNG  GO-GETTER NAMED JOHN OLIVER SITTING IN THIS SHARE. I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS  SHOW--   (APPLAUSE)
THIS SHOW WILL BE MUCH  CLASSIER WHILE HE IS  HOSTING. YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT MY  RETURN IT WILL INSTANTLY  DROP BACK DOWN TO THE LEVEL  YOU HAVE LONG EXPECTED OF  IT. (LAUGHTER)  ACTUALLY, OBVIOUSLY I'M  GOING, GOING TO SHOOT A  LITTLE MOVIE BASED ON REALLY AN AMAZING STORY THAT BEGAN  WITH A FIELD PIECE THAT WE  AIRED ON THIS SHOW. AT LEAST OUR INVOLVEMENT  WITH THE STORY. IN 2009, YOU KNOW A LOT OF  TIMES WE HAVE CORRESPONDENT. WE SEND THEM PLACES. I'M TO THE GOING TO TELL YOU  WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS BUT WE  ACTUALLY TRIED TO GET A CORRESPONDENT INTO IRAN  BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN NICK  NAMED THE AXIS OF EVIL. WE WANTED TO SEE, YOU KNOW,  WHO THESE EVIL PEOPLE WERE. AND IT TURNED OUT THEY GOT  KIDS AND EVERYTHING AND THEY  PLAY BALL AND EAT FOOD AND DON'T WANT TO GO TO WAR ALL  THE TIME. BUT WE DID INTERVIEW IN 2009  A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND IT  WAS RIGHT BEFORE THEIR  ELECTION BETWEEN AHMADINEJAD AND MOSS OUSSAVI THAT TURNED  INTO THE GREEN MOVEMENT  WHICH TURNED INTO REALLY,  ANYWAY, THIS IS THE PIECE WHERE WE FIRST MET MAZIAR  BAHARI S SO TAKE A LOOK.
Reporter: THE ISLAMIC  REPUBLIC OF IRAN, A NATION  IN UPHEAVAL. A POWDER KEG WAITING TO  EXPLODE. BUT AS WE EMPATHIZE WITH  THESE COURAGEOUS SOULS RISK  THEIR LIVES TO TAKE A STAND FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE FACE OF  OPPRESSION, LET US NOT  FORGET THESE PEOPLE ARE EVIL. BUT JUST WHAT IS IT THAT  MAKES THEM SO EVIL? I HADN'T SIGNED UP FOR  TWITTER, SO THE ONLY WAY TO  FIND OUT WAS TO GO AND SEE  FOR MYSELF. AS I TOUCHED DOWN AT THE  AIRPORT ON MY 36th BIRTHDAY  I WAS COMPLETELY ALONE. NO AMERICAN EMBASSY, NO  ALCOHOL, NOT EVEN EXPOSED  ANKLES TO LEER AT.
I HAVE A WIFE AND  CHILDREN. PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.
I ASSURED MY PRODUCER TIM  GREENBERG THAT AS LONG AS HE  WAS WITH ME THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR. FIRST UP I MADE CONTACT WITH  MY TRANSLATOR MAHMOUD. WE HEADED TO A COFFEE SHOP  FOR A CLANDESTINE PETING  WITH IRANIAN JOURNALIST  MAZIAR BAHARI. I WAS TOLD HE WOULD GO BY  THE CODE NAME PISTACHIO AND  I WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM BY-- OH, I DIDN'T SEE THREW. I ASKED HIM A QUESTION ON EF  REWERNER'S MIND WHY WAS HIS  COUNTRY SO TERRIFYING.
IN ONE WORD  MISUNDERSTANDING. THE TWO SIDES DON'T  UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. THEY DON'T KNOW THE VALUES  OF THE OTHER SIDE. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK  TO THE OTHER SIDE. AND ACTUALLY I HAVE WRITTEN  ABOUT THAT FOR "NEWSWEEK"  MAGAZINE SEVERAL TIMES.
YEAH, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND  A WORD OF THAT. MAHMOUD, COULD YOU TRANSLATE  THAT FOR ME.
YES, HE IS SAYING HE HAS  WRITTEN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM  THAT YOU HAVE IN "NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE AND YOU CAN READ  ABOUT IT.
OKAY. WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID THAT I SAID I  HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT IT FOR  "NEWSWEEK" MAGAZINE SEVERAL  TIMES.
I'M GOING TO NEED SOMEONE  WHO SPEAKS ENGLISH.
THE ONE THING I COULD  UNDERSTAND WAS THAT THIS  ENTIRE COUNTRY IS EVIL. THE FIRST THING TO KNOW  ABOUT IRAN IS IT IS NOT  EVIL.
IRANIANS AND AMERICANS  HAVE MUCH MORE IN COMMON  THAN THEY HAVE DIFFERENT.
WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON  WITH YOU.
WHO IS NUMBER ONE ENEMY  OF THE UNITED STATES.
AL QAEDA.
AL QAEDA IS ALSO THE  NUMBER ONE ENEMY OF IRAN. ACCORDING TO AL QAEDA  MEMBERS, ANY SHI'A, ANY  IRANIAN HAS TO BE KILLED AND  IF YOU KILL AN IRANIAN YOU WILL GO TO HEAVEN AND WILL  YOU HAVE --
ENOUGH OF HIS WESTERN  EDUCATED "NEWSWEEK" DOUBLE  SPEAK. THE REAL SEETHING ANGER WAS  ON THE STREETS.
SO WHEN DID YOU START  HATING AMERICANS?
TO HATING AMERICANS?
UH-HUH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN.
HATING?
NEVER.
NO, NO, WE NEVER HATE  THEM.
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO A  THING HERE WHERE WE SAY  IRANIANS HATE AMERICANS, CAN YOU JUST DO THAT FOR ME.
YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO  HATE.
YEAH, COULD YOU.
TO HATE.
YEAH, PLEASE.
NO, WHY, NO.
I'M NOT HATE OF AMERICANS.
OKAY.
I'M NOT HATE.
NO, NO, APPARENTLY THEY  DIDN'T FEEL FREE TO EXPRESS  THEIR HATRED FOR US IN  PUBLIC. SO MAHMOUD SECURED AN  INVITATION TO A PRIVATE  IRANIAN HOME.
HELLO.
HELLO.
HI.
HI.
OH. YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CAVE.
THANK YOU.
IF I COULD JUST EARN  THEIR TRUST I COULD FINALLY  PEERS THIS SOCIETY AND EXPOSE THEIR TRUE FEELINGS. OUR MEETING BEGAN WITH  TRADITIONAL SMALL TALK.
SO WHAT DID ONE JEWISH  BIRD SAY TO THE OTHER JEWISH  BIRD?
CHEAP, CHEAP. RIGHT? BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAP. YOU KNOW, AND THEY LOOK LIKE  BIRDS WITH THE BIG KNOWSES. WOW. -- NOSES, WOW, THAT JOKE  WANT RIGHT OVER THEIR HEADS.
WE DON'T HATE JEWS, WE  DON'T HATE ANYBODY,  ACTUALLY. WE DON'T HATE AMERICANS.
AS THE NIGHT WORE ON IT  BECAME PAINFULLY OBVIOUS. ENGAGEMENT WITH THESE PEOPLE  WAS FUTILE. THE GAP WAS TOO WIDE. -- WAS INEVITABLE.
THIS IS YOUR BIRTHDAY  CAKE.
YOU'RE LIKE MY PERFECT  FAMILY.
THANK YOU.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT  GUY.
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE TOLD  ME ONE THING, I WASN'T  GETTING MY CARTON OF  CIGARETTES BACK FROM HIS  DAUGHTER. IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS IN FOR  A VERY LONG WEEK.
Jon: JASON JONES. WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL TALK
