FROM AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, THE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN ON THE COMMITTEE OF ECONOMIC... I DON'T  KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT. SO HERE'S WHERE... SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO GO OUT AND FOCUS ON  MANUFACTURING AND THE GROWTH AGENDA. WE WANT TO GET BACK TO IT. HERE'S WHERE IT FALLS APART FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME. SO THE PRESIDENT SAYS TO US FOR QUITE A WHILE, THE ONLY WAY TO GROW THE ECONOMY IS THE  STIMULUS, AND SO WE POUR A TON OF STIMULUS IN, AND HE SAYS, THIS WORKED. WE GREW TWO MILLION... WE DID... THIS STIMULUS IS GREAT. IT'S GOTTEN US BACK ON TRACK. SO NOW I AGREE, LET'S CUT EVERYTHING, LIKE ISN'T THAT THE...
I DON'T THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. IF THE STIMULUS WAS WHAT WORKED, WHY WOULD THE NEXT STEP BE THE OPPOSITE TO THE STIMULUS?
I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT. ONE, THE DESIGN, THE RECOVERY ACT, WHY WE HAD TO RELY ON THE GOVERNMENT IS THE PRIVATE SECTOR  IS IN FREEFALL. YOU COULDN'T SAY, AH, WE'RE GOING TO PASS A TAX CREDIT, TRY TO GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO  LEAD THE RECOVERY IN THE SPRING OF 2009 EVERYTHING IS GOING DOWN THE TUBES. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PREVENT A DEPRESSION.
OKAY.
NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS DEBT DEAL, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS LONG-RUN FISCAL IMBALANCES IN  THE COUNTRY, AND THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL CUT TO THE DEFICIT.
Jon: I SAW THE CHART.
WELL, WE'LL DISAGREE.
Jon: ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY PARALLELOGRAM?
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT. LOOK, $2 TRILLION IS... I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN A BIGGER  CUT TO THE DEFICIT THAN THAT. SOMETHING LIKE 1/1,000th OF THE MONEY IS IN THE YEAR 2012, AND THAT'S BY DESIGN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO CUT $500 BILLION RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD LIKELY ADD ANOTHER HEAVY BLOW TO  THE ECONOMY, WHICH BECOULDN'T AFFORD. THOUGH I MIGHT ALSO ADD, DESPITE SOME MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT SAYING, WELL, MAYBE A DEFAULT  WOULD BE OKAY, IT WOULD-BE -- WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN OKAY. THE TREASURY SENDS OUT 80 MILLION CHECKS. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN...
Jon: WOULD WE HAVE PAID OUR CREDITORS AND THEN JUST GONE INTO LIKE I GUESS YOU CALL IT  THE FETAL POSITION?
WELL, IT DEPENDS. WHEN THEY SAID WE WOULDN'T DEFAULT AS LONG AS WE PAID THE CHINESE AND PAID THE  BONDHOLDERS, TO NOT PAY THE MILITARY IN A WAR, TO NOT PAY SOCIAL SECURITY FOR THE RETIREE  RETIREES... YOU'RE DEFAULTING ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Jon: THEY WEREN'T EVEN TALKING STRATEGY AND INSURGENCY. THEY WERE WONDERING IN AFGHANISTAN, ARE WE GETTING PAID. THEY WERE ASKING ME, AND I DIDN'T BRING MY WALLET. [LAUGHTER] THE THING IS WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT GETTING THIS DEBT SCREELG DISCUSSION OUT OF THE WAY, WE'RE  ADDRESSING SOME OF THE LONG-TERM FISCAL CHALLENGES. BUT IT ALLOWS US TO GET BACK TO LET'S STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO  WHAT KIND OF EYEBROW CUTTINGS DO THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE AND WHAT HAVE YOU. LET'S GET BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY, WHICH ARE, AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE THE BREAK, LOOK, LET'S PASS AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WHERE IT TAKES ONLY A LITTLE MONEY FROM  THE GOVERNMENT, IT WILL EVERYAGES PRIVATE CAPITAL. WE CAN BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO COMPETE AGAINST OTHER NATIONS.
Jon: THAT SEEMS PERFECT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONE PLACE  WHERE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY HIRE, OUTSOURCE CHINESE WORKERS TO COME AND BUILD OUR BRIDGES. WE HAVE TO DO THAT.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT IF YOU TALK TO... THIS IS A PLACE WHERE  BOTH LABOR AND THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AGREE. THEY'RE SAYING, WE NEED MORE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE A PATENT BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW ENTREPRENEURS TO GET... INSTEAD OF WAITING THREE YEARS, WHICH IS HOW LONG IT TAKES ON AVERAGE TO GET A PATENT, WE CAN GET IT DOWN TO ONE YEAR. YOU CAN GET AN ANSWER SO YOU WOULDN'T BE BROKE BEFORE YOU GOT IT.
Jon: THAT SPEAKS TO A LARGER ISSUE. DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE BUSINESS IS OVERREGULATED? DOES HE THINK WE ARE BUREAUCRATICALLY SO SNAFUED AND ENTANGLED THAT THAT IS THE  PROBLEM WITH THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW?
AS A GENERAL MATTER, NO. THOUGH THERE CERTAINLY ARE INDIVIDUAL THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE DIFFERENT AND STREAMLINED  WHERE, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT PAPER FORMS. THEY CAN'T DO IT ON THE WEB, YOU KNOW, THINGS OF THIS NATURE. BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID FROM WAY BACK WHEN, JUST BEING FOR RULES OF THE ROAD DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANTI-MARKET. WHAT WE SAW IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, WHAT WE SAW IN OIL DRILLING IN THE GULF AND A BUNCH  OF PLACES, RIPPING UP THE RULES OF THE ROAD, WE'RE DEVASTATING TWO BUSINESSES. IT WASN'T JUST THAT IT WAS BAD FOR SOCIETY, IT WAS BAD FOR THOSE COMPANIES THAT NOBODY WAS  FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE ROAD BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOSE PUBLIC TRUST, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
Jon: I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE TIMES YOU'VE COME ON THIS SHOW AND LET ME LIKE  BASKETBALL ON AT YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THINGS. AND I HAVE SAT HERE THROUGH NUMEROUS APPEARANCES AND TALKED OUT OF MY ASS, AND YOU HAVE  NEVER ONCE...
THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'RE SELLING YOURSELF SHORT. >>JON JON OH, NOW WE'RE BACK TO SHORT. IS THAT IT? [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE, I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU ARE AS GIDDY AS A SCHOOLGIRL.
PEOPLE FROM CHICAGO, YOU GET THAT IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM. WE'RE LIKE THE SALMON OR SOMETHINGMENT I'M JUMPING OUT OF THE LAKE. I'M HEADED HOME.
Jon: I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THEY GO UPSTREAM. I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL YOUR PARTY.
THE ATLANTIC SALMON.
Jon: AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, WE WISH YOU WELL.
