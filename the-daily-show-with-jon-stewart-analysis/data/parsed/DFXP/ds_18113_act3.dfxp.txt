[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT A VERY FUNNY  ACTOR WHOSE NEW FILM WHICH HE  COWROTE AND CODIRECTED AND STARS IN IS CALLED "THIS IS THE END."
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEAL WITH  THIS?
CAN I HAVE THAT MILKY WAY. NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE THE MILKY  WAY. THAT'S MINE. I WENT OUT THIS MORNING,  SPECIFICALLY BOUGHT THIS MILKY  WAY TO EAT AFTER MY PARTY.
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GET  THE WHOLE MILKY WAY.
I'LL BE PRETTY BUMMED IF I  DON'T AT LEAST GET A BITE OF THE  MILKY WAY.
EVERYONE GETS A FIFTH OF  EVERYTHING.
I WANT ONE-FIFTH OF YOUR  T-SHIRT, THE BOTTOM TOP. THE BELLY.
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE MY MID  RIF.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE  SHOW SETH ROGEN.
JOHN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TURNING  UP.
IT'S NICE THEY GOT A GUY WITH  THE SAME NAME SO I DON'T HAVE TO  LEARN A NEW ONE.
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW  RELIEVED I WAS TO FIND THIS  MOVIE AS FUNNY AS I DID.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE TO YOUR  FIRST GUEST.
THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE NEVER INTERVIEWED ACTORS  BEFORE. I ACTUALLY SWEAR TO YOU I HAD AN  ANXIETY DREAM LAST WEEK.
WHAT WAS I DOING TO YOU? IT WAS... I WAS INTERVIEWING  JADYN SMITH.
THAT IS SCARY. I KNOW. I SAID TO HIM IN THIS DREAM I  SAID IT LOOKS REALLY BAD. JUST YOUR SHOULDER I CAN SEE  WILL SMITH GOING LIKE THIS. LIKE A 1950s... SO IT IS SO  FUNNY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU DIRECTED THIS AS WELL. I DID. I CAN'T LET JON STEWART BE THE  ONLY JEW IN HOLLYWOOD DIRECTING  MOVIES. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF IT  WASN'T FOR ME STEPPING IN. IT'S JUST US NOW.
A PRETTY BOLD MOVE TO DECIDE  YOUR FIRST MOVIE TO DIRECT IS  GOING TO BE ABOUT THE END OF THE  WORLD.
BOLD IS ONE WORD FOR IT. INCREDIBLY STUPID MIGHT BE  ANOTHER WORD FOR IT. IT'S AS COMPLICATED A MOVIE AS  YOU CAN REALLY MAKE. THERE'S GIANT MONSTERS AND THE  WORLD ENDING AND DEMONS AND IT'S  A COMEDY WHICH MAKES IT EVEN  HARDER. BUT, YEAH, YOU KNOW, I MARCH  INTO DIFFICULTY. WHY NOT GO FOR IT.
YOU COWROTE AND CODIRECTED  WITH YOUR FRIEND.
MY FRIEND EVAN GOLDBERG WHO I  MIGHT IN BAR MITZVAH CLASS.
THAT'S A NOTE TO ANY WRITERS  OUT THERE. JUST FAKE BEING JEWISH.
EXACTLY. LOCK ON TO THE FIRST KID THAT  YOU SEE.
IT'S TRUE. YOU COULD PROBABLY FIND A GOOD  PARTNER IN BAR MITZVAH CLASS. IF YOU'RE TOO OLD, IT WOULD BE  CREEPY. OVER THE AGE OF 30 DON'T LOOK  FOR A WRITING PARTNER IN A BAR  MITZVAH CLASS.
TAKE A LAPTOP AND SAY WHERE  ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS? THE TWO OF YOU... WHEN WE WERE  BACK IN CANADA AT 13 YEARS OLD  LITTLE DID WE THINK WE'D BE DIRECTING A MASSIVE MOVIE WITH A  60-FOOT SATAN WITH A SWINGING  PENIS.
EXACTLY. SPOILER ALERT. WE ACTUALLY DID SAY THAT  WHICH IS SO WEIRD. ONE DAY THIS GIANT [BLEEP] IS  GOING TO COME TO LIFE. AND NOW WE HAVE THE MONEY TO DO  IT. SO THANK GOD. IT'S THE BIGGEST [BLEEP] EVER IN  A MOVIE I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
HE TALKS THE TALK BUT BELIEVE  ME THIS MOVIE ALSO WALKS THE  WALK. IT IS A HUGE SAT ANDIC SWINGING [BLEEP] [BLEEP]. IT DEFINITELY DOES. NOW THE N.S.A. IS... DON'T SHAKE  YOUR HEAD. OWN THAT.
I WILL OWN THAT. I'LL OWN THAT [BLEEP].
THIS N.S.A. STORY. IT'S CRAZY. ABSOLUTELY NUTS.  IS. AS AN AMERICAN HUMAN BEING. WHICH I AM. YOU ARE DEFINITELY  GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT IS A FACT. DOES THAT UNNERVE YOU AT ALL?
NOT REALLY. I ASSUME THAT THEY READ ALL THAT [BLEEP] KIND OF. DON'T YOU THINK? A LITTLE BIT. BUT I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT  ABOUT IT UNTIL RIGHT NOW  HONESTLY.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO THINK ABOUT  IT BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE'D PLAY  A LITTLE N.S.A. WE WILL BE THE N.S.A. SO WE PUT  A CAMERA IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM  AS A NATIONAL SECURITY MEASURE. JUST TO SEE, LIKE CAN WE ROLL  THAT CLIP NOW.
YOU BOOKED ME ON THE DAILY  SHOW WITH JON STEWART AND  THERE'S NO JON STEWART. IT'S SOME BRITISH GUY. THAT WHINY ACTOR OUT OF HIS T  EAVMENT-DRINKING MOUTH. I WOULD RATHER BE CLEANING THE  BATHROOM IN GIANT STADIUM WITH  MY BUSH. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A [BLEEP] FROM A POISONOUS TARANTULA. I STAND BY ALL THAT.
AND THAT'S THE ONLY IMPORTANT  THING. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T GET IN  TROUBLE IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE  ANYTHING WRONG.
EXACTLY. I'VE DONE A LOT WRONG.
LOOK, ON EVERY LEVEL THIS WAS  SO FUNNY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH. NO. THANK YOU. YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN JADYY H N  SMITH. AND YOU WEREN'T.
I APPRECIATE IT. SETH ROGEN, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN.
