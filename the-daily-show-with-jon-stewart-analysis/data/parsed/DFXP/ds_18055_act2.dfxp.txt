(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: WELCOME BACK. WHILE WATCHING THE SUPER BOWL,  AMERICANS ALWAYS KEEP ONE EYE OR  TWO ON OUR BIGGEST RIVALS ABROAD: IRAN AND CHINA. TAKE YOUR EYES OFF ONE SECOND  AND THEY START PULLING STUFF. CHINA, LAST WEEK
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SAYS  HACKERS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING HIS  COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS.
CHINESE HACKERS REPORTEDLY  STOLE E-MAIL PASSWORDS FOR EVERY  SINGLE "NEW YORK TIMES"  EMPLOYEE.
Jon: THAT'S IT? THAT'S YOUR BIG ATTACK? YOU'RE THE GUYS WHO BEAT THE [BLEEP] OUT OF US IN MATH AND  SCIENCE. YOU SEND YOUR ELITE HACKER SQUAD  OUT AND ALL THEY GET IS MAUREEN  DOWD'S EMAIL ADDRESS. IT'S LIKE TRYING TO STARVE US BY  DISRUPTING OUR VEGETABLE SUPPLY. YOU WANT OUR ATTENTION, HACK OUR  TV NEWS.
TODAY AS CNN TRIED TO COVER  THE NEWS ABOUT THE HACKING  STORY, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BLACKED OUT THE STORY.
CHINA IS LITERALLY WATCHING  CNN ON AIR WITH THE FINGER ON A  BUTTON
Jon: THAT'S NOT JUST THE  CHINESE. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW WE ALL  WATCH CNN.
I'M WOLF BLITZER. YOU'RE IN THE...
Jon: (JON HITS BUTTON). (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )   I HAVE TO SAY, CHINA, I'M NOT  FEELING THAT THREATENED. MAYBE IRAN COULD PICK UP THE  SLACK.
NOW THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS  OF IRAN'S SPACE PROGRAM TO DATE,  THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC ENTERS A MONKEY INTO SPACE AND RECOVERS  HIS SAFELY.
Jon: OR YOU COULD SHOOT A  MONKEY INTO SPACE. NO ONE WAS MORE EXCITED ABOUT  THIS THAN THE MONKEY HIMSELF. SEEN HERE DOING HIS IMPRESSION  OF HANS SOLO IN CARBONITE. IRAN, YOU THINK THE C.I.A.... YOU JUST GOT PITA ON YOUR [BLEEP]. THAT GUYS DON'T [BLEEP] AROUND. NOT FOR NOTHING. A LITTLE PROPAGANDA ADVICE. YOU CAN'T BRAG TO US. WE DID THAT 50 YEARS AGO. WE HAD BEEN LAUNCHING SPACE  MONKEYS BEFORE YOU HAD US  OVERTHROW YOUR DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT. I'M SORRY. IT WAS EISENHOWER'S IDEA. WHAT'S NEXT, IRAN?
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IRAN  SENT LIVE ANIMALS INTO SPACE. INCLUDING A MOUSE, A TURTLE AND  A WORM INTO ORBIT IN 2010.
Jon: ISLAMIC SPACE MOUSE,  TURTLE AND WORM ALL OF WHICH  INSPIRED THE HIT, SHIA PETS. (LAUGHING) I JUST WANT TO BRING  YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS. THERE IS ACTUALLY A WORM IN A  SPACE SUIT. A TURTLE, A MOUSE, A MONKEY AND  THERE IS A WORM JUST IN CASE... I BELIEVE OLD WORMY IS WHAT THEY  CALL HIM. ONE SLIGHT PROBLEM: SOMEHOW THE  MONKEY WHO GOT SHOT INTO SPACE  WASN'T LIKE THE MONKEY WHO SUPPOSEDLY CAME BACK. THAT CAN MEAN ONLY ONE OF TWO  THINGS. EITHER THE LAUNCH WAS A DUD AND  IRAN IS COVERING UP ITS FAILURE  OR -- AND I THINK THIS IS MORE LIKELY -- THEY HAVE SECRETLY  BUILT THE FIRST ALL PRIMATE  ORBITAL COSMETIC SURGERY SPA. THE MONKEY GETS A NIP AND TUCK. ANY SHORT-TERM SWELLING OR  BRUISES WHEN HE GETS BACK, HE'S  LIKE I JUST GOT BACK FROM SPACE. CUT ME SOME SLACK. YOU KNOW WHO THIS WILL BE HUGE  ABOUT. THE LITTLE OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE. NICE. NOW THAT'S A MONKEY I'D LIKE TO [BLEEP]. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
