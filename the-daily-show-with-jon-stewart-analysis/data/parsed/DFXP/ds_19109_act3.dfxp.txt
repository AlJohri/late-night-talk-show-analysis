Jon: OKAY. WELCOME BACK SO WE'RE HERE, WE'RE TALKING WITH FORMER SECRETARY OF TREASURY TIMOTHY GEITHNER. SO THIS GETS INTO OUR NEXT ELEMENT WHICH IS THE PERCEPTION AMONGST THE ENGINEERS OF THE BAILOUT THAT THEY ARE BEING UNREASONABLY CASTIGATED.
NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE. IT WAS DEEPLY UNFAIR. THE RESCUE ITSELF AT ITS CORE IS A FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR THING, EXCEPT --
Jon: CORRECT. -- EXCEPT RELATIVE TO THE ALTERNATIVE OF LETTING THE SYSTEM BURN DOWN.
Jon: THAT SEEMS LIKE A FALSE CHOICE.
IT'S NOT A FALSE CHOICE.
Jon: YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE BAILOUT COULD HAVE BEEN ENGINEERED IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN THE ONE WE DID IT, OTHERWISE WE HAVE A DEPRESSION.
I KNOW IT'S HARD. IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT, EXCEPT THERE'S BEEN A GREAT HISTORY OF MISTAKES AND ERRORS OF COUNTRIES TRYING TO HAVE IT ALWAYS DO IT DIFFERENTLY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY MORE DAMAGING FOR THEIR COUNTRIES. THE IDEA THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH STRONGER RECOVERY AND LESS DAMAGING IS MOSTLY NOT ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE RESCUE. BECAUSE THE RESCUE WAS VERY EFFECTIVE, IT DID THE ESSENTIAL THING, MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE --
Jon: DIDN'T IT JUST REINFLATE A TOXIC SYSTEM?
NO.
Jon: THE BANKING SYSTEM WAS TOXIC, YES?
ABSOLUTELY.
Jon: WE PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BACK INTO IT TO MAKE THEM WHOLE WHILE KIND OF IGNORING THE HOME OWNER SECTION.
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THAT (LAUGHTER) IN EFFECT, WHAT HAPPENED --
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WE LET THIS CRISIS, IN SOME WAYS, BURN TOO HOT. AND I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THIS, DON'T SEE IT, BUT, IN EFFECT, THE REASON WHY THIS WAS SO SEVERE IS BECAUSE WE LET THAT PANIC GET TO MOMEMTUM AND, IN SOME WAYS, WE ALLOWED TOO MUCH FAILURE AND CRUSHING FAILURE ACROSS THE SYSTEM. NOW, AFTER THE WE BROKE THE PANIC, WE DID FORCE THEM TO RAISE A BUNCH OF CAPITAL, PAY BACK THE TAXPAYER, UNWIND ALL THOSE PROGRAMS.
Jon: LET'S TALK ABOUT FORCING THEM, BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY OF PHRASING IT BECAUSE WHAT WE DID IS WE GAVE THEM THAT MONEY AND THEN WE OPENED UP A DISCOUNT WINDOW GO TO AND BORROW AT 0%, TURN AROUND AND BUY TREASURIES AT 3% AND BASICALLY CREATE --
NOT QUITE. LET ME SAY IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.
Jon: OKAY (LAUGHTER)
WHAT WE DID --
Jon: THEY GAVE US $100, AND WE GAVE THEM $103.
LET ME SAY IT DIFFERENTLY.
Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WE DID WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN A PANIC, OKAY, WHICH IS WE, FOR A PRICE, FOR A FEE --
Jon: 5%.
WELL, SOMETIMES IT WAS CHEAPER THAN THAT, SOMETIMES IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT. WE GAVE THEM A SET OF PROTECTIONS WHICH WE MADE THEM PAY FOR AND WE MADE THEM PAY THE TAXPAYER BACK. AND THE TAXPAYER EARNED A PROFIT ON THOSE PROGRAMS  WHICH ARE GOING TO BE WORTH WELL TO $100 BILLION.
Jon: THAT SUGGESTS THE DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY WAS MERELY THE TAXPAYER IS ON THE HOOK --
NO, IT'S TO SUGGEST THAT IF PEOPLE PERCEIVE THIS TODAY STILL AS IF WE WENT AND GAVE THEM MONEY THAT THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO SEE AGAIN THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO DO.
Jon: I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW WE EDIT THIS. SO I AM GOING TO SAY, LIKE, TIM GEITHNER, THANK YOU SO MUCH! (APPLAUSE) THERE IS SO MUCH ON THE WEB RIGHT NOW ON THIS, I DON'T KNOW IF WE BROKE THE WEB OR NOT, BUT THE THE BOOK IS CALLED "STRESS TEST." TIMOTNY GEITHNER WROTE IT, WAS THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY. IT'S A VERY INTERESTING READ. I ACTUALLY SAY THIS, IT'S A REALLY WELL-WRITTEN BOOK AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU CAN YELL AT CERTAIN PAGES, IF YOU WANT. (LAUGHTER) BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STOPPING BY AND SPENDING AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH US. TIMOTNY GEITHNER, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. (APPLAUSE) ♪♪
