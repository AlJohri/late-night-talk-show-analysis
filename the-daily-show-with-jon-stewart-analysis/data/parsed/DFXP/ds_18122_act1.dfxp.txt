COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS  HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK,  THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)    Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
WELCOME TO THE DAILY  SHOW. WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW. I AM JOHN OLIVER, JON  STEWART STILL NOT HERE. HE IS CURRENTLY WALKING  ACROSS THE GRAND CANYON. MY GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE  ROOST, THE GREAT QUEST LOVE  IS WITH US. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO IT  TONIGHT. HUGE NEWS THIS MORNING OUT  OF THE SUPREME COURT.
THE SUPREME COURT JUST A  SHORT TIME AGO STRUCK DOWN A  KEY PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. NOW THIS PART DETERMINES  WHICH STATES MUST ACTUALLY  GET FEDERAL PERMISSION  BEFORE THEY CHANGE THEIR VOTING LAWS.
OKAY, BASICALLY THE KEY  PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS  ACT THEY REMOVED WAS THE ONE THAT APPLIED STRICT SCRUTINY  TO STATES WITH A PREVIOUS  HISTORY OF RACIAL  DISCRIMINATION, THOSE STATES, OF COURSE, BEING WHITE  SYLVANIA, PALE-AFORNIA, CAW  CARIACUT, AND MISSISSIPPI. BUT LOOK, LOOK--   (APPLAUSE)  THIS IS CLEARLY A VERY BOLD  MOVE FROM THE SUPREME COURT THIS WAS A LANDMARK PIECE OF  CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION. I HOPE THAT CHIEF JUSTICE  ROBERTS HAS A PRETTY  COMPELLING REASON TO GET RID  OF IT.
IN HIS OPINION CHIEF  JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS WROTE  OUR COUNTRY HAS CHANGED.
OH, THAT'S FINE THEN,  THAT'S FINE. (LAUGHTER)
THAT'S ALL. WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD THEN. BECAUSE IT HAS CHANGED. WE HAVE GOT iPADS, TWITTER,  MAXI PADS WITH WINGS. (LAUGHTER)  EVERY ONE IS ALLERGIC TO BRE  NOW-- BREAD NOW AND RACIALLY  THINGS HAVE GOT BETTER IN THE SOUTH. IT'S TRUE, PRIMARILY BECAUSE  OF THINGS LIKE, OH, I DON'T  KNOW, THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? INTERESTING STORY. THAT'S THE PIECE OF  LEGISLATION THAT NOW HAS A  HOLE OF IT THE EXACT SHAPE  OF JOHN ROBERTS MIDDLE  FINGER. (LAUGHTER)  NOW YOU MIGHT THINK, YOU  KNOW, IT'S SO OLD, THE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT. IT'S PROBABLY OBSOLETE. WHEN DOES THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT EVER NEED TO  PROTECT MINORITY VOTERS FOR  INVOKING SECTION 5. AND THE ANSWER IS BASICALLY  NEVER IF BASICALLY NEVER  MEANS, AND THIS IS TRUE, 74 TIMES SINCE THE YEAR 2000. AND JUST IN CASE YOU NEEDED  A REMINDER OF WHAT THE  VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS  PREVENTING, LESS THAN TWO HOURS AFTER THE SUPREME  COURT'S RULING, ONE OF THE  STATES FLAGGED IN THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT DID THIS.
IN TEXAS THEY HAVE TWO  ISSUES RIGHT NOW, THE  REDISTRICTING CASE AND THE MOST RESTRICTIVE VOTER-- IN  THE COUNTRY. THEY ANNOUNCED TODAY THEY  ARE GOING TO START  IMPLEMENTING THOSE TOMORROW.
TWO HOURS! THEY COULDN'T EVEN WAIT FOR  TWO HOURS. IT TAKES TEXAS LESS TIME TO  DISENFRANCHISE MINORITY  VOTERS THAN IT TAKES FOR  THEM TO BARBECUE A PIG. (LAUGHTER)  AND THEY DO THAT WELL. THEY DO THAT WELL. NOW-- NOW TO BE FAIR, TO BE  FAIR, THERE IS GOOD NEWS AND  BAD NEWS. GOOD NEWS, THE COURTS DID  LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR THE  LAW TO BE AMENDED. BAD NEWS, IT HAS TO BE  AMENDED BY CONGRESS. SO, SO-- WAIT, WAIT, HAVE  SOME FAITH BOYS AND GIRLS. SO CAN THEY BE TRUSTED TO  GET THIS DONE? WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THEIR  RECENT TRACK RECORD. LAST WEEK THEY TOOK UP THE  FARM BILL, FAMOUSLY ONE OF  THE EASIEST PIECES OF  LEGISLATION THEY HAVE TO VOTE ON. AND DON'T WORRY, THEY MADE  HISTORY.
IN WASHINGTON THE HOUSE  VOTED DOWN A FARM BILL FOR  THE FIRST TIME IN AT LEAST 40 YEARS.
WE DID IT! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WE DID IT! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. SORT THIS OUT-- THEY VOTED  IT DOWN? WHY WOULD THEY POKE THE  HEARTLAND RIGHT IN THE CORN  HOLE?
80% OF IT ISN'T REALLY  ABOUT FARMING, PER SE. THE BULK OF THE FARM BILL IS  THE COUNTRY'S FOOD STAMP  PROGRAM OR WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE SUPPLEMENTAL  NUTRITION ASSISTANT PROGRAM  OR SNAP.
OR SNAP! DID YOU JUST  HEAR WHAT HE JUST CALLED  FOOD STAMPS, HE CALLED THEM THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITIONAL  ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, SNAP! (LAUGHTER)  SO-- HANG ON, HANG ON. HANG ON. FARM BILL IS A FAKE NAME TO  TRICK US INTO FEEDING POOR  PEOPLE. I THOUGHT THAT THOSE  BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS  WENT TO A GOOD CAUSE LIKE  PAYING LOCAL FARMERS LIKE MONSANTO TO NOT GROW CORN IN  THEIR FIELDS, AND INSTEAD  YOU'RE JUST GIVING MONEY TO HUNGRY PEOPLE FOR FOOD,  WHICH THEY ARE LITERALLY  FLUSHING DOWN THE TOILET  AFTER EATING AND DIGESTING FOR VITAL NUTRITION. (LAUGHTER)  I ASSUME THAT THAT IS WHY  THIS BILL FAILED.
THE FARM BILL FAILED  BECAUSE VERY CONSERVATIVE  REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST IT BECAUSE THEY SAID IT COSTS  TOO MUCH. DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST IT  BECAUSE IT CUT TOO MUCH FROM  FOOD STAMP.
OKAY. SO NOT ONLY DIDN'T IT CUT  ENOUGH SPENDING, IT ALSO CUT  TOO MUCH SPENDING. IT'S LIKE THE BILL WAS  GOLDILOCKS AND THE FIRST  BEAR SAYS I THINK YOUR FOOD  STAMP CUTS ARE TOO LOW. AND THE SECOND BEAR SAYS I  THINK YOUR FOOD STAMP CUTS  ARE TOO HIGH. AND INSTEAD OF THERE BEING A  MODERATE BEAR THE FIRST TWO  BEARS TEAR GOLDILOCKS LIMB FROM LIMB AND EAT HER. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT  HAPPENED. (APPLAUSE)  TO BE FAIR, THEY ARE BEARS. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE  VOTING DOWN BILLS THAT WOULD  DO SOMETHING. THEY ARE PASSING BILLS THAT  WOULD HAVE NO CHANCE OF EVER  DOING ANYTHING.
CONGRESS VOTED ON OBAMA  CARE THIS WEEK. IT WAS THE 37th TIME THEY  DID IT IN SOME WAY, SHAPE,  FORM OR FASHION. THE REPUBLICAN LEAD HOUSE  DID VOTE TO REPEAL IT BUT  THE BILL, OF COURSE, IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL IN THE SENATE.
37 DIFFERENT VOTES AND  NOTHING. IT'S ALMOST IMPRESSIVE TO  VOTE 37 DIFFERENT TIMES ON  SOMETHING AND STILL GET  NADA. UNLESS, UNLESS MAYBE THIS  ISN'T INEPTITUDE, MAYBE  CONGRESS IS JUST ATTEMPTING  CANTRIC LAWMAKING. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DOING  NOTHING, KEEPING PERFECTLY  STILL, NOTHING HAPPENING. BUT IN FACT THEY'RE  SKILLFULLY BUILDING UP  LEGISLATION UNTIL IT  EVENTUALLY EXPLODES IN THE GREATEST LORE OF ALL TIMES. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  -- GREATEST LAW OF ALL TIMES! NOW THIS IS NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT JUST A VOTING  RIGHTS ACT IN CONGRESS'S  HANDS. THE IMMIGRATION BILL IS  RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. IT'S EASY TO DESPAIR AT  THIS. IS THERE NO MAJOR ISSUE THAT  CONGRESS COULD TACKLE THAT  WOULD STAND A CHANCE OF PASSING WITH BIPARTISAN  SUPPORT?
MR. SPEAKER,-- WOULD  ALLOW THE SECRETARY OF THE  INTERIOR TO CONTINUE THE SALE OF ELECTRONIC DUCK  STAMPS AND ALSO EXPANDS THE  PROGRAM TO INCLUDE ALL OF  OUR 50 STATES.
YES! (LAUGHTER)  THE BELOVED DUCK STAMPS  FINALLY A WAY TO MAIL MY  DUCKS BACK HOME. I'M BEING TOLD IT'S ACTUALLY  A HUNTING PERMIT OF SOME  KIND. BUT MAYBE, MAYBE CONGRESS  CAN REGAIN OUR FAITH IN IT  JUST BY PASSING THIS BUN  INCREDIBLY NARROW BILL ENABLING PEOPLE TO BUY DUCK  STAMPS ELECTRONICALLY IN ALL  50 STATES. DO YOU BELIEVE, BOYS AND  GIRLS? DO YOU? DO YOU?
THE YEAS ARE 401, THE  NAYS ARE 0, THAI THIRDS  VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THE RAWLS ARE SUSPENDED. THE BILL IS PASSED!
THIS IS THE ONE! THE SYSTEM WORKS! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT IS SUCH A RELIEF. WHEN IT COMES TO PASSING  BORDERLINE MEANINGLESS  LEGISLATION, YOU ARE THE  BEST AROUND! SO CONGRESS, HERE'S A  TRIBUTE TO YOU FOR BEING  ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT  DON'T NEED DOING ♪ YOU'RE THE BEST AROUND ♪  ♪.
HR-1157, THE BILL TO  INSURANCE PUBLIC ACCESS TO  THE SUMMIT OF RATTLESNAKE  MOUNTAIN.
THE BILL IS PASSED.
THE BILL TO DIRECT THE  SECRETARY OF STATE TO  DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO OBTAIN OBSERVER STATUS FOR TAIWAN.
HR-251, A BILL TO DIRECT  THE SECRETARY OF THE  INTERIOR TO CONVEY CERTAIN FEDERAL FEATURES OF THE  ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM  TO THE SOUTH UTAH VALLEY  ELECTRIC SERVICE DISTRICT AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
THE BILL IS PASSED.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
