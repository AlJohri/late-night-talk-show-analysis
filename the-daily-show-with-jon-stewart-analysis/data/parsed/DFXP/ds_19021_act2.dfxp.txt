( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon:  WELCOME BACK. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IT WAS OLD TOM JEFFERSON WHO SAID THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE FOUNDATION OF ANY GOVERNMENT. SO WHAT HAPPENS TO ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO FLOUT THAT WILL? WHAT HAPPENS THOSE WHO DON'T? JASON JONES FILES THIS REPORT.
AMERICAN POLITICIANS SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PEOPLE, AND JUST ONE WRONG MOVE CAN END YOUR CAREER, WHETHER IT BE THIS OR SOMETHING FAR WORSE. -- VOTING YOUR CONSCIENCE.
I WAS SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE COLORADO STATE SENATE. WE PASSED COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION AND I WAS RECALLED FOR THAT.
YOU LIVE IN COLORADO. WHY WOULD DO YOU THAT?
BECAUSE IT WAS THE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
IN THE WAKE OF A TRAGEDY MORSE FORCED GUN SAFETY REGULATION ON AN UNWILLING POPULOUS AND WAS BOOTED FROM OFFICE IN A RECALL ELECTION. POLITICAL STRATEGIST JIM SPENCER THINKS PASSING THOSE LAWS WAS ( BLEEP ) STUPID. HOW DANGEROUS IS IT TO VOTE AGAINST POPULAR OPINION?
IT'S USUALLY POLITICAL SUICIDE.
YOU COULD SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT TRYING TO PROTECT OTHER PEOPLE FROM GETTING SHOT ALL OVER.
YOU CAN DO THE WRONG THING BY DOING THE RIGHT THING.
A NEEDLESS LOSS OF POLITICAL LIFE. IF ONLY MORRIS HAD LISTENED TO THE PEOPLE.
DON'T TAKE AWAY MY GUNS. AND NOBODY'S TAKING AWAY ANYBODY'S GUNS--
SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. I HAVE THEM. DON'T TAKE THEM AWAY.
NOBODY WOULD TOUCH YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, BUT YOU WOULD NEED A  BACKGROUND CHECK TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL BEFORE YOU GET A GUN.
OF COURSE.
IF YOU WANT CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMIT YOU HAVE TO GET SOME OF THAT TRAINING IN PERSON, NOT JUST ON THE INTERNET.
IT SAYS RIGHT HERE THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE APPROVED OF EVERY SINGLE LAW MORRIS HELPED PASS. WAIT? WHAT? I HIT THE STREETS OF COLORADO TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED. LET'S SAY THERE WAS A POLITICIAN BEING RECALLED FOR ENACTING VERY LEVEL-HEADED GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION.
SURE.
WOULD YOU VOTE TO SAVE HIM.
YEAH.
DID YOU VOTE TO SAVE HIM?
NO.
I THINK THE NEW GUN LAWS HERE RIGHT NOW ARE PRETTY GOOD.
THAT MAKES SENSE. IT ALSO MAKES SENSE YOU VOTED IN THE RECALL ELECTION, RIGHT?
I DON'T THINK I DID. WHAT PART-- WHEN DID WE VOTE FOR THAT?
I HAVEN'T VOTED YET, NO.
YET, IT WAS IN SEPTEMBER.
NO, DIDN'T VOTE.
NO, I DIDN'T.
DID YOU NOT?
NO.
AND DID YOU VOTE?
NO.
I THINK IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE. I THINK THERE ARE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES YOU CAN TALK ABOUT, WHETHER BACKGROUND CHECKS.
IT WAS COMMON SENSE YOU WOULD VOTE IN THE RECALL ELECTION.
ABSOLUTELY.
DID YOU?
I DID NOT. ( LAUGHTER ).
YUP.
OKAY.
80% OF THE PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP TO VOTE. IF I COULD HAVEN GOTTEN EVEN THIS MUCH OF THAT 80% TO SHOW UP THE ELECTION WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY.
WHO WAS THE, 20%?
THE NEW LAWS I DON'T THINK SHOULD EXIST AT ALL.
15-ROUND LIMIT. WHY CAN'T I HAVE 16? WHO ARE-- WHO ARE THEY TO TELL ME I CAN'T HAVE 16.
EXACTLY, 16 ALIENS COME, ONLY 15 DIE AND ONE IS PROBING YOU.
EXACTLY.
AND GUESS WHAT? DID YOU VOTE IN THE RECALL ELECTION.
YES I DID. >>TURNS OUT GETTING THE ANTI GUN CONTROL PRO CHIN BRAID CROWD TO THE POLLS WASN'T HARD AT ALL.
I THINK THAT THE N.R.A. AND GUN GROUPS WERE VERY STRATEGIC. ALL OUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS MOTIVATE PEOPLE MORE THAN POSITIVE EMOTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN COLORADO.
HOW DO YOU MOTIVATE REASONABLE PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND VOTE?
THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE TUNED IN ARE THE ANGRIEST PEOPLE.
SO MAKE THEM ANGRY.
YEAH, MAKE THEM ANGRY.
IF IMAGINARY TERRIBLE THINGS ARE WHAT GET PEOPLE ANGRY ENOUGH TO VOTE, I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO. HI, THERE, I'M JASON JONES. DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A NEW LAW THAT SAYS THE NFL HAS TO MOVE TO EUROPE?
COME ON!
DON'T BLAME ME! BLAME YOUR GOVERNMENT. LISTEN, I GET. IT, YOU'RE BUSY. BUT YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS BUSY? CRAZY PEOPLE ARE TOO. THEY'RE GOING TO OUTLAW LATTES. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BEARD, YOU HAVE TO GROW ONE? IF YOU DO HAVE A BEARD-- HOLD STILL-- THEY ARE GOING TO REVOKE YOUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO SHOOT HOOPS.
I'M TAKING THIS BALL FOR AMERICA! COME ON, YOU ( BLEEP ). I SWEAR TO GOD I'LL ( BLEEP ). IT'S WORKING! IT'S WORKING! >>
