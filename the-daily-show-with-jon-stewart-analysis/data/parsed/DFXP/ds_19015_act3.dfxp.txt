Stephen: WELCOME BACK, MY GUEST TONIGHT RESEARCH PROFESSOR OF EDUCATION AT NYU ALSO AN AUTHOR, HER LATEST BOOK IS CALLED REIGN OF ERROR THE HOAX OF THE PRIVATIZATION AND DANGER TO AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM, DIANE RAVITCH.
HELLO.
THANK YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?
GREAT, THANK YOU. WONDERFUL.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
WONDERFUL, WAS LAUGHING MY HEAD OFF AT THE EARLIER SEGMENT, LOVED IT.
REALLY QUITE AMUSING, WE ARE. WE WORK ON THAT FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF A DAY.
REIGN OF ERROR THE HOAX OF THE PRIVATIZATION MOVEMENT AND DANGER TO AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS. FOR ME THE MOST SURPRISING THING IN THE BOOK IS YOU SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME, ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE MAKE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THAT THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN. YOU MAKE THE CASE HERE THAT IS NOT CORRECT.
ACTUALLY, NO, IT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. WHAT I DID WAS TO LOOK AT ALL THE DATA AND I FOUND OUT THAT THE TEST SCORES TODAY ARE THE HIGHEST EVER IN HISTORY. GRADUATION RATES HIGHEST EVER IN HISTORY. DROPOUT RATES LOWEST EVER IN HISTORY AND I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT KIDS TODAY ARE, IN FACT, THE SMARTEST GENERATION YET.
Jon: --  (APPLAUSE)
Jon: WHAT IT SEEMS TO SPEAK TO THOUGH, IS THAT LIKE WEALTH INEQUALITY THERE IS AN EDUCATION INEQUALITY. BECAUSE THAT IS AN AMORTIZATION, I WOULD IMAGINE. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TEST TEST SCORES AND GRADUATION RATE YET IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS.
OH, YEAH.
Jon: THAT ARE REALLY STRUGGLING.
THERE ARE-- I MEAN THE SINGLE BIGGEST SOURCE OF LOW ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IS POVERTY, AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF CHILD POVERTY AMONGST ALL THE ADVANCED NATIONS OF THE WORLD. THERE WAS A REPORT-- .
Jon: SO WE'RE NUMBER ONE.
WE ARE NUMBER ONE, NUMBER ONE IN CHILD POVERTY. AND WE NOW HAVE ABOUT HALF OF OUR STATES WHERE HALF THE KIDS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY, FOR A RICH COUNTRY THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
Jon: ALSO PEOPLE HAVE AN IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS AN INNER CITY ISSUE. AND IT IS NOT. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AREAS, PEOPLE VIEW IT AS MIDDLE CLASS OR BLUE COLLAR, THOSE AREAS WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE, THEY HAVE FOOD INSECURITY, THEY HAVE DIFFICULTIES AS WELL. THIS IS A VERY WIDE SPREAD ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION, YES?
WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY FOCUSED ON WHEREVER THERE IS POVERTY THERE ARE LOW TEST SCORES LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. KIDS ARE SICK, KIDS DON'T MAKE IT TO SCHOOL AS OFTEN. THEIR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED BECAUSE OF ALL THE HUGE PROBLEMS, EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OF THEIR LIVES.
UH-HUH.
AND YET THESE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES REFORMERS SAY DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. THAT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. THAT IS WHAT WE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO. I MEAN IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION IN AMERICA, WE WOULD HAVE SMALLER CLASS SIZES. PARTICULARLY FOR KIDS WHO ARE POOR. (APPLAUSE)
Jon: .
WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA HAD EVERY DAY A NURSE OR HEALTH CLINIC THAT KID COULD GO TO WHEN THEY WERE SICK. WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAD THE ARTS, THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAD PHYSICAL EDUCATION, THAT CHILDREN WHO GO TO-- .
Jon: THESE AREAS, SO THE FAMILIES IN THESE AREAS, BECAUSE THIS GETS INTO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT YOU BRING UP IN THE BOOK. THE FAMILIES IN THIS AREA ARE RIGHTLY CONCERNED, THOUGH, WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF SOME OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THEIR AREAS. THESE SCHOOLS CAN BE DILAPIDATED, POORLY PERFORMING AND THESE TYPES OF THINGS. THERE IS THIS MOVEMENT AND THE CHARTER MOVEMENT THAT SAYS WHAT'S WRONG WITH GIVING CHOICE TO THOSE KIDS IN THOSE AREAS, BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS AROUND THEM ARE NOT SERVING THEIR NEEDS, WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT IN YOUR MIND?
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT IS THAT IT IS PART OF, I BELIEVE, A PURPOSEFUL EFFORT TO CREATE A CONSUMER MENTALITY AROUND EDUCATION. PUBLIC EDUCATION IS A PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY. WHETHER YOU SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR TO RELIGIOUS SCHOOL OR YOU HOME SCHOOL THEM, THAT'S YOUR RIGHT. AND IF YOU HAVE NO CHILDREN AT ALL, YOU'RE STILL OBLIGATED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC EDUCATION. WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO SAY THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION IS NOT PUBLIC, IT'S A CHOICE, IT'S A CONSUMER CHOICE. THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY THE SENSE OF CIVIC OBLIGATION SO THE NEXT TIME-- .
Jon: TURN IT INTO A MARKETPLACE.
EXACTLY. SO THE NEXT TIME A BOND ISSUE IS UP YOU WILL SAY WELL, I DON'T HAVE A CHILD IN  SCHOOL. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR THE BOND ISSUE. WE'RE GOING TO DESTROY PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT WAY.
Jon: DO YOU THINK, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO MOST PARENTS THEY WOULD SAY THE BIGGEST BANE OF THEIR EXISTENCE IS THIS NEW, YOU KNOW, CORE CURRICULUM THAT IS BEING TESTED. BUT THEY WOULD ALSO SAY TENURE IS ALSO A PROBLEM, THE TEACHERS UNION IS TOO RIGID, DO YOU ALSO ADMIT THAT THERE CAN BE REFORM IN THAT AREA AS WELL? THAT THAT CAN WORK TOGETHER?
WELL, LET ME SAY THAT I'M PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CRITIC OF THE STATUS QUO. I DON'T LIKE THE STATUS QUO. THE STATUS QUO TODAY IS TEST, TEST, TEST, PRETEST, POST TEST, DATA, KIDS ARE NOT LOOKED AT AS INDIVIDUALS, THEY'RE LOOKED AT AS DATA POINTS. I THINK IT'S ALL WRONG. I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF YOU LOOK ON YOUR SCHOOL, YOU GO SHOPPING AND PICK YOUR SCHOOL THE WAY YOU PICK YOUR SHOES OR YOUR AUTOMOBILE. THAT IS WRONG TOO. PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL AND EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD. ONE WHERE THEY ARE VERY HAPPY TO SEND THEIR KIDS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE TEACHERS ARE TERRIFIC. THE FUNNY THING IS IF YOU LOOK AT WHOLE DATA FROM GALLUP WHAT IT SHOWS IS PEOPLE ARE ASKED HOW IS AMERICAN EDUCATION DOING. THEY HAVE HEARD 30 YEARS OF AMERICAN EDUCATION IS BROKEN, IT DOESN'T WORK, IT'S OBSOLETE. SO THEY AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION NO GOOD. HOW IS YOUR SCHOOL, YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL.
WELL, MY NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL IS TERRIFIC. MY TEACHERS ARE GREAT. I LOVE MY TEACHERS.
Jon: IT LIKE CONGRESS, YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT THE SAME WAY. MY CONGRESSMAN IS OKAY BUT THE INSTITUTION-- DO YOU HAVE TIME TO STICK AROUND. WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE, REIGN OF ERROR ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW, DIANE RAVITCH. WE'LL COME BACK WITH A LITTLE MORE
