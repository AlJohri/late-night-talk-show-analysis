[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE FROM 2009 UNTIL 2013. HER NEW MEMOIR IS CALLED "HARD CHOICES." PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON. SECRETARY. NICE TO SEE YOU. OH, THEY'RE VERY EXCITED. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HOW ARE YOU?
I AM GREAT. I AM ABSOLUTELY GREAT. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
Jon: I'M DOING VERY WELL.
I COULD SEE THAT.
Jon: HERE IS THE, HERE IS THE BOOK THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN. THIS IS CALLED "HARD CHOICES." IT'S CLEARLY YOU'RE, YOU'RE...
A LOT OF HARD CHOICES. LOT OF HARD CHOICES.
Jon: NOT FOR YOUR EDITOR. LOOK AT THAT BABY.
THE REAL STORY IS THAT IT WAS EVEN LONGER.
Jon: WAS IT REALLY?
OH, YES. AND... WELL, THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH THAT HAPPENED IN THOSE FOUR YEARS.
Jon: SURE.
AND I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT, KIND OF PULL THE CURTAIN BACK, SO PEOPLE COULD GET AN IDEA WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE WORLD, AND I WROTE MUCH MORE THAN THAT, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. SO THIS WAS LIKE TAKE THE WHIP OUT AND TAKE THE SCALPEL AND CUT IT DOWN.
THIS IS, IT'S AN INCREDIBLY, I THINK, COMPLEX AND WELL REASONED AND EYE WITNESS VIEW TO THE HISTORY OF THOSE FOUR YEARS. AND I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY WHEN I SAY, NO ONE CARES. THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, YOU KNOW...
Jon: ARE YOU? ARE YOU RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, JON, I WAS GOING TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT, BUT I SAW... I MEAN, YOU KIND OF SPOILED IT FOR ME.
Jon: NO, NO, NO.
NO, I MEAN...
Jon: SO THAT'S A YES. THAT'S YES.
THE BIG SPOILER. SO I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO RECONSIDER WHERE I GO DO IT.
Jon: SURE. THERE WAS A LITTLE CONFUSION HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE?
RIGHT.
Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I SENSE?
YES. PLEASE, PLEASE DO.
Jon: A LITTLE CONFUSION. YOU KNOW, IT TAKES ME BACK TO MY DAYS POST-COLLEGE. LET ME... YOU KNOW, THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT... I HAVE, IT'S LIKE A CAREER APTITUDE TEST. AND, IT CAN HELP YOU.
THIS IS GOOD. I'M READY. I'M READY.
Jon: SO DO YOU... LET ME JUST ASK YOU, BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO HELP YOU SORT OF HONE IN ON IF YOU EVEN WANT TO DO THIS JOB. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION: DO YOU LIKE COMMUTING TO WORK OR DO YOU LIKE A HOME OFFICE? WHAT'S YOUR, UH...
NO, I'VE SPENT SO MANY YEARS COMMUTING, I'D KIND OF PREFER A HOME OFFICE. THAT'S WHERE I WROTE MY BOOK. IT WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF OUR HOUSE, SO THAT WORKS.
Jon: DO YOU HAVE FAVORITE SHAPE FOR THAT HOME OFFICE? DO YOU LIKE THAT OFFICE, LET'S SAY WOULD YOU LIKE THAT OFFICE... WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO HAVE CORNERS OR WOULD YOU LIKE IT NOT TO HAVE CORNERS? I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE WORLD IS SO COMPLICATED, THE FEWER CORNERS THAT YOU CAN HAVE, THE BETTER. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: DO YOU PREFER TO SIT IN TRAFFIC OR CAUSE IT?
I REALLY HATE TO CAUSE TRAFFIC, AND SOMETIMES I DO. AND I DEEPLY REGRET IT. I'M TELLING THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN I HAVE OVEREAGER POLICE WHO ARE ACCOMPANYING ME WHO ARE SO BRAVE AND THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST JOB, I SOMETIMES HAVE TO SCROUCH DOWN, GET ON THE FLOOR, I START THIS BOOK TALKING ABOUT GETTING ON THE FLOOR, HIDING, TRYING TO GO TO A SECRET MEETING WITH BARACK OBAMA. THAT HAPPENS TO ME A LOT. SO, I PREFER NOT TO CAUSE TRAFFIC.
YOU ACTUALLY TRAVEL LIKE A KID SNEAKING INTO A DRIVE-IN THEATER? LIKE...
YEAH.  I TRY TO. YEAH SO, AND,  AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES LIKE LITTLE DISGUISES SO I CAN LOOK OUT THE WINDOW BUT NOBODY WILL KNOW IT'S ME.
Jon: WELL LET ME ASK YOU A FINAL QUESTION: DO YOU ENJOY CONSTANT, NON-STOP CRITICISM? [LAUGHTER]
ENJOY IS PROBABLY THE WRONG WORD.
Jon: EXPECT?
EXPECT, SURVIVE...
Jon: SURE.
LIVE THROUGH. IT JUST SORT OF COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.
Jon: IT DOES COME WITH THE TERRITORY. SO, IT SOUNDS TO ME, IF I MAY, YOU'VE DECLARED FOR THE PRESIDENCY. WHY ELSE? BECAUSE... [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE CRAZY THING. HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED, IF YOU WERE NOT I THINK RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, ALL OF THIS CRITICISM, I TRULY BELIEVE THIS, THERE'S TWO BOOKS OUT NOW THAT ARE EXPOSES OF YOU AND THE FAMILY AND ALL THAT. THERE IS CONSTANT CALLS FOR TESTIMONY. THERE ARE CONSTANT PARSING OF WORDS.
YEAH. IF YOU STOP THAT TOMORROW, IF YOU SAID, I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, IT ALL STOPS. DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS IF IT ALL STOPPED. IT SEEMS TO BE...
IT WOULD STOP FOR YOU. THEY'D MOVE ON TO CHRIS CHRISTIE OR WHOEVER ELSE.
THEY MIGHT. BUT I'VE BEEN AMAZED AT WHAT A COTTAGE INDUSTRY IT IS. AND SO I KIND OF EXPECT IT WOULD CONTINUE.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO I'M NOT REALLY PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION.
IT'S JUST THESE TALKING HEADS, SITTING AROUND, PICKING OUT EVERY LITTLE THING AND MAKING FUN OF IT. I MEAN, IT'S JUST, IT'S NOT RIGHT. [LAUGHTER]
COULD I, COULD I SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY.
Jon: YEAH, NO... WHAT WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK YOU MOST OFF GUARD, WAS IT THE WE WERE DEAD BROKE, WHEN YOU SAID THAT?
WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS AN INARTFUL USE OF WORDS, OBVIOUSLY.
Jon: RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, BILL AND I HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
Jon: RIGHT.
BUT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT, AND I TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOK, IS I'M WORRIED THAT OTHER PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES WE DID...
Jon: RIGHT.
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE CAME FROM, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, GREAT CIRCUMSTANCES IN TERMS OF OUR FAMILY LOVING US AND, YOU KNOW, BILL HAD A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT UPBRINGING THAN I DID, BUT STILL WE BELIEVED THAT WE COULD PRETTY MUCH MAKE OUR WAY UP THE LADDER. AND NOW I THINK A LOT OF PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE. AND THAT BOTHERS ME A LOT.
Jon: RIGHT.
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT'S KIND OF AWESOME? THAT SAYS TO ME YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? HOW EASILY YOU PIVOTED FROM THAT INTO INCOME INEQUALITY IN AMERICA. THAT SAYS TO ME YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. BECAUSE OTHERWISE...
BUT THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT IT.
Jon: YEAH.
I MEAN, YOU AND I HAVE BEEN LUCKY. I THINK WE'D HAVE TO AGREE. RIGHT? I MEAN...
Jon: WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LUCKY. [LAUGHTER]
WELL, WE BOTH HAVE WORKED HARD. WE BOTH HAVE WORKED HARD.
Jon: NO, WE HAVE. WE HAVE BEEN, WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY.
BUT WE ALSO WERE BORN INTO CIRCUMSTANCES, MAINLY BEING IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE WE HAD ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.
Jon: SURE. RIGHT. SO IN YOUR MIND THOUGH THEN, ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT NO LONGER EXISTS FOR PEOPLE OR THAT WE, THERE IS SOMETHING ABJECTLY WRONG WITH GOVERNMENT OR THE SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO INFORM?
YEAH.  I THINK BOTH. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IT EXISTS FOR THEM ANYMORE. AND WE HAVE SIX MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN 16 AND 24 IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE NEITHER IN SCHOOL NOR IN WORK. THEY'VE KIND OF GIVEN UP.
Jon: RIGHT.
AND THAT'S A TERRIBLE DEVELOPMENT. AND SO, YEAH, I THINK THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL IT. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGE BOTH OUR ECONOMIC AND OUR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT A REALITY AGAIN. I THINK THAT'S THE BIG BUSINESS.
Jon: WHEN WE COME BACK, WILL YOU TELL US HOW TO DO THAT?
SURE.
Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT AFTER THIS.
