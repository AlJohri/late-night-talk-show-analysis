(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WE'RE BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAMMED A  MIRL MIKE MULLEN. (APPLAUSE) HOW ARE YOU?
TERRIFIC.
Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.
Jon: I THINK STARTING THIS SHOW WITH JUSTIN BIEBER AND ENDING WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE  JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF MAKES THIS THE WEIRDEST "THE DAILY SHOW" ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN.
THERE'S WONDERFUL EXCITEMENT TONIGHT AND IT WAS TERRIFIC TO  SEE HIM AND BE B BACK WITH YOU.
Jon: HE'S A NICE KID.
HE IS, HE IS.
Jon: AND SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY LOOKING OUT FOR HIS BEST INTERESTS.
THEY ARE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW ARE YOU DOING? I KNOW THAT THE UNITED STATES MILITARY PRIDES ITSELF ON READINESS. YOU GAME FOR ALL SORTS OF SITUATIONS, NORTH AFRICA AND WHAT'S HAPPENED IN TUNISIA AND EGYPT. DID THIS TAKE US BY SURPRISE? I KNOW IT'S BEEN AN AREA OF CONCERN BUT HAS THIS TAKEN US BY SURPRISE TO SOME EXTENT?
WELL, I THINK ACTUALLY IT HAS TAKEN NOT JUST US BUT MANY PEOPLE BY SURPRISE AND CERTAINLY  WE'RE LOOKING AT... WE'VE GOT A 30-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE  PEOPLE OF EGYPT AND CERTAINLY A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP FROM OUR MILITARY TO THEIRS THAT HAS  PROVEN TO BE VERY STRONG. ALSO IN THIS CRISIS THAT THEY'RE IN. BUT TO A GREAT DEGREE I THINK THE TIMING OF IT CERTAINLY CAUGHT US AS IT MOVED FROM  TUNISIA AND SORT OF ACROSS TO THE REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE THAT SITS THERE RIGHT NOW IN EGYPT.
Jon: YOU SAY WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MILITARY. WE HAVE TRAINED THEIR OFFICERS, HAVE WE NOT. THEY'VE COMED HERE AND TRAINED.
WE HAVE, ACTUALLY BY THE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OVER THE COURSE OF THAT 30 YEARS. SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF CONTACTS, WE'VE GOT RELATIONSHIPS, THEY'VE LIVED WITH US, THEIR FAMILIES HAVE LIVED WITH US. SO ONE OF MY CHIEF GOALS RIGHT NOW IS TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN. I'VE TALKED TO MY COUNTERPARTS A COUPLE OF TIMES. AND ALSO THAT WE'VE GOT OUR MILITARY READY SHOULD ANY KIND OF SUPPORT BE REQUIRED AND THAT  ISN'T THE CASE RIGHT NOW. I'M VERY FOCUSED ON THAT.
Jon: THIS IS A STRANGE QUESTION AND MAY BE IN A DIFFERENT AREA BUT IS IT ODD FOR  THE UNITED STATES... WHEN WE GO INTO IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROMOTING  DEMOCRACY, WE'RE BRINGING A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND WE'VE  DONE IT THROUGH AN INVASION AND RELATIVELY EXTREME MEASURES YET IN EGYPT AS WE SEE A DEMOCRATIC  MOVEMENT COMING FROM THE GROUND UP WE GO, LIKE, HEY, WHAT'S THAT? IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE ISN'T THAT THE FRUIT OF THAT LABOR AND IS IT THAT AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE TO  BALANCE THIS IDEA OF STABILITY AND OUR INTERESTS WITH THIS DEMOCRACY. CAN WE HAVE IT BOTH WAYS LIKE THIS?
I THINK WE DO HAVE TO BALANCE THAT AND PROBABLY BALANCE RIGHT  NOW IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO LOOK AT THIS. IT'S A VERY VOLATILE SITUATION. IT'S EVOLVING. THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW. WE HAVEN'T KNOWN SINCE IT STARTED AND IN MANY CRISES LIKE THAT THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF  UNKNOWNS SO CERTAINTY WITH OUTCOMES AND CERTAINTY WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW  IT'S JUST NOT THERE. BUT IN THAT UNCERTAINTY, CERTAINLY, I HAVE AN EXPECTATION AND A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY. THEY'VE REAFFIRMED THE SUPPORT OF THEIR PEOPLE. THEY'VE REAFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT OF THE INSTITUTIONS. AND CERTAINLY WE'RE ALL HOPEFUL THIS CAN EVOLVE PEACEFULLY WITH NO MORE VIOLENCE AND IN A WAY  WHERE IT REALLY IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE.
Jon: WHAT IS THE IDEA THAT IF THERE WAS... IF THEIR ARMY-- WHICH I GUESS IS NOW TRYING TO  GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTROL-- IF THEY WERE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AGAINST THEIR OWN  PEOPLE, DO WE HAVE AN OPTION THERE OR I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS COULD WE EVER GO IN TO  PROTECT THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE FROM THEIR OWN MILITARY?
I THINK THAT THE OUTCOME IS UP TO THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE AND ALSO THEIR LEADERSHIP INCLUDING  THE ARMY. I MEAN, IN DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH THEIR MILITARY LEADERSHIP, THEY HAVE REASSURED ME THAT THEY HAVE NO INTENT TO FIRE ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE. THEY HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO QUELL THE VIOLENCE FROM YESTERDAY, THE TRAGIC VIOLENCE  THAT OCCURRED, THE PRIME MINISTER CAME OUT AND APOLOGIZED FOR IT THAT HE'S GOING TO DO AN INVESTIGATION. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T RECUR. BUT IT'S AN EVOLVING SITUATION THAT WE HOPE CAN JUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE PEACEFULLY SO THE  EGYPTIAN PEOPLE CAN END UP WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY WANT.
Jon: NOW, AS YOU LOOK ACROSS THE REGION NOW THAT YOU'RE  SEEING IT WITH A PAIR OF FRESH EYES, SEEING IT COULD HAPPEN IN EGYPT, DO YOU LOOK AND THINK  "SYRIA, THEY'VE GOT ABOUT A WEEK." (LAUGHTER) "THESE GUYS ARE GOING DOWN. LEBANON, GEE." DO YOU SEE THIS ENTIRE REGION NOW GOING THROUGH OR IS IT  BECAUSE WE ARE SO... BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY UNUSUAL RIPPLES IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD. IT'S JUST THAT THEIR GOVERNMENTS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO QUASH THEM BEHIND A VEIL NOW  THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE WAY IT IS. PEOPLE SEE IT MORE. ARE WE SEEING SOMETHING NEW OR IS THIS A REPRISE OF A CYCLE?
WELL, OVERALL I WOULD THINK IT IS NEW AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE  MIDDLE EAST AND LEADERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. YOU'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT OF YEMEN SPEAK PUBLICLY THAT HE ISN'T GOING TO STAND FOR  ELECTION IN A COUPLE YEARS, NOR WILL HE TURN IT OVER TO HIS FAMILY. YOU'VE... I'VE ENGAGED LEADERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE  REGION TO... AGAIN, THAT WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH. WE'VE WORKED HARD IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE MILITARY TO HAVE  RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MILITARY FOR MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES. THEY HAVE GONE TO OUR SCHOOL SO IT'S AN EASY CALL TO MAKE EVEN IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION  AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THIS GOES AND HOW CONTAGIOUS IT IS AND WHAT IT  MEANS IN EACH COUNTRY, SOMETHING WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT.
Jon: AND FOR YOU PERSONALLY IS IT THE TYPE OF THING... ARE  THEIR MILITARIES CONTROLLED IN A SIMILAR MATTER? IT'S NOT CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP. I THINK THAT'S THE THING THAT CONFUSES ME ABOUT EGYPT. IS THE MILITARY AN ARMY OF MUBARAK? THE MILITARY IN EGYPT IS VERY WELL RESPECTED. IT'S SEEN AS AN INSTITUTION OF GREAT INTEGRITY. NOT SO MUCH THE POLICE FORCES AND WHOEVER IT IS THOSE GUYS ON CAM METS WITH WHIPS ARE. NOBODY KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. (LAUGHTER) BUT THE MILITARY DOES NOT HAVE THAT REPUTATION.
NO, THEIR REPRESENTATION IS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WITH THE  PEOPLE AND I THINK THEY'D SAY... THE MILITARY WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S WHO THEY ARE SUPPORTING. THE PEOPLE OF EGYPT. AND THAT'S WHY THE REPRESENTATION IS AS GOOD AS IT IS WITH THE POPULATION THERE.
Jon: ALWAYS GOOD TO... DO YOU MIND, CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR FIVE MINUTES? CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT?
SURE.
Jon: ADMIRAL MIKE MULLEN, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS. (APP||||
