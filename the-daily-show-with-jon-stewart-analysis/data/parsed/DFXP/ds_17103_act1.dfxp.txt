2012, MAY 10TH, 2012, FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD STUDIOS IN NEW YORK THIS IS  THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STE WARTS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL   (  THEME SONG PLAYING  )  (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE  )
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE HAVE A SHOW FOR YOU TODAY. ROBERT CARO WILL BE JOINING US, AUTHOR OF "THE PASSAGE OF POWER"  IT'S THE FOURTH VOLUME IN HIS REMARKABLE BIOGRAPHY OF LBJ, LBJ, OF COURSE, SPANISH FOR THE BJ. (LAUGHTER) BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH LAST NIGHT'S MOMENTOUS NEWS.
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GO AHEAD AND AFFIRM THAT I THINK SAME-SEX COUPLES  SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MARRIED (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: FINALLY,-- FROM ITS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT STILL BELIEVES IT IS AN ISSUE BEST LEFT TO THE STATES. BUT THEY'RE NOT COMPLAINING TONIGHT. IT'S A GREAT DAY WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SAYS ON NATIONAL IT  WAS GAY PEOPLE SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELEGATED TO ONLY PLANNING OTHER PEOPLE'S WEDDINGS. IT'S NOT RIGHT! IT'S LIKE PUTTING A CAT IN CHARGE OF THE GOLDFISH TOSS GAME. IT'S NOT FAIR! YOU'RE JUST TORTURING THE CAT. LET HIM EAT THE FISH OR MOVE HIM DOWN TO THE CLOWN. THAT'S A BETTER GAME FOR THE CAT. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? I FORGOT ALREADY. GAY MARRIAGE. MANY WERE SUGGESTING THAT THE PRESIDENT'S HAND WAS FORCED BY HIS VICE PRESIDENT  OLD FLUBS McGILL CUTIE OF THE DELAWARE BLABBERMOUTH BY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE WITH  HIS REMARKS ON "MEET THE PRESS" LAST SUNDAY.
SO YOU ARE NOT UP SET WITH FEBRUARY.
WOULD I HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE DONE THIS IN MY OWN WAY.
Jon: I'M SORRY MR. PRESIDENT, I APOLOGISE FOR CUTTING YOU OFF THERE, I'M HAVING TROUBLE HEARING YOU BECAUSE OF ALL THE  [BLEEP] BIRDS! DID YOU FILM THIS AT THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE RAINFOREST CAFE? WHAT IS GOING ON BACK THERE! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THE IMPORTANT THING FOR AMERICAS IS-- CAW, CAW, CAW! OOOH-HA-HA,-A,-AN. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN? GAY MARRIAGE, ANYWAY, LET'S GO BACK TO THE SET OF RIO TO HEAR THE REST OF THE  PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT.
WOULD I HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE DONE THIS IN MY OWN WAY, IN MY OWN TERMS, WITHOUT, I THINK THERE BEING A LOT OF NOTICE TO EVERYBODY, OF COURSE. BUT ALWAYS'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
Jon: THERE YOU GO. SO YOU KIND OF FORCED YOUR HAND. A BIG MOUTH FRIEND OF YOURS, YOU KNOW, SAID SOMETHING. NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT YOU WERE HOPING TO TELL THEM IN YOUR OWN WAY. (LAUGHTER) CONGRATULATIONS, MR. PRESIDENT. YOU REALLY HAVE WALKED A MILE IF GAY AMERICA'S SHOES. (LAUGHTER) SINCE IT WAS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR OBAMA'S PRESIDENT I'M SURE FOX NEWS WAS  [BLEEP] AN ASSAULT ON TRADITIONAL VALUES.
WHAT MI MOST CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHETHER REPUBLICAN WAS GO OUT ON A LIMB AND TRY  TO PAGE THIS A CAMPAIGN ISSUE WHILE SITTING VERY FIRMLY WITH WITHOUT MUCH  QUESTION ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY ON IT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: JEFF SMITH JEFF SMITH, COME ON, FOX, IT'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THE MOST DIVISIVE CULTURAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME, REMEMBER?
THERE IS A GAY AND SECULAR FASCISM IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO IMPOSE  ITS WILL ON THE REST OF US.
IF YOU CHANGE THE VARIABLES AND SAY THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A MAN AND  A WOMAN T CAN BE A WOMAN AND WOMAN AND MAN AND WOMAN.
WHY NOT A PAN AND WOMAN AND WOMAN AND WOMAN, IT MAY SOUND CRAZY.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE BUT HERE YOU GO. THIS IS THE SLIPPERY SLOPE. IF YOU LEGALIZE GAY MARRIAGE AND GAY SEX AND ALL OF THAT, THEN ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO MARRY FIVE PEOPLE CAN DO IT, YOU CAN MARRY A TURTLE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: BILL, SEE, FOX, YOU USED TO THINK GAY MARRIAGE WOULD END WITH ALL OF US  MARRYING TURTLES, WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, YOU THINK WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR TO SUPPORT IT. (LAUGHTER)
HEY, MY NAME IS MITCH-- WHY DON'T YOU MARRY ME AND WE CAN MOVE RIGHT  INTO MY HOUSE, I KEEP IT ON MY BACK. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: COME ON, THE PRESIDENT SUPPORTING AN ATTACK ON THE INSTITUTION OF  MARRIAGE, AND CHRISTIAN VALUES. GAY PEOPLE CAUSE HEUER KARNTION REMEMBER.
THISES WITH ALL ABOUT POLITICS AS USUAL, NOT PRINCIPLES.
THIS IS ABOUT GETTING RE-ELECTED IN NOVEMBER.
FROM THE POLITICAL STANDPOINT, IT SMELLS BAD.
THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY DRIVING THIS. IT IS ALL ABOUT POLITICS AND IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.
AND THIS IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME AS A NATION. IN LIKE FIVE YEARS THE PRIME TALKING POINT FROM REPUBLICANS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO  SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE HAS GONE FROM IT WILL DESTROY SOCIETY VIA [BLEEP] (LAUGHTER) TO OH, OF COURSE YOU'RE FOR IT YOU'LL SAY ANYTHING POPULAR TO GET RE-ELECTED. (LAUGHTER) AND THAT IS PROGRESS. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: IT SEEMS PRETTY CYNICAL, SEEMS PRETTY CYNICAL TO TRY AND CREATE A  DIRECT LINE FROM THE PRESIDENT'S PRINCIPLESED STAND FOR SOME IMMEDIATE CRAVEN POLITICAL GAIN.
ONE DAY AFTER  NOURNS-- ANNOUNCING HIS PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR GAY MARRIAGE HE ATTENDS A  HOLLYWOOD FUND-RAISER AT THE HOME OF MOVIE STAR GEORGE CLOONEY.
THE TOTAL FUND-RAISING HALL COULD HIT A RECORD-BREAKING $15 MILLION.
Jon: WELL PLAYED. STILL, YOU GOT TO ADMIT THAT GOING TO BE AMAZING. MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE FREE WORLD, HAVING BARACK OBAMA OVER TO HIS HOUSE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: FOR A FUND-RAISER, BOOM! FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED WITH SENIOR HOLLYWOOD CORRESPONDENT JASON JONES! JASON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) SO JASON, YOU ARE AT THE FUND-RAISER AT GEORGE CLOONEY'S HOUSE? S WHATTEE BEEN THE HOLLYWOOD COMMUNITY'S REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT'S BIG ANNOUNCEMENT? HAS IT BEEN POSITIVE?
HAS IT BEEN POSITIVE? PRESIDENT OBAMA IS IN A GIANT HOLLYWOOD PARTY THE NIGHT AFTER HE CAME OUT FOR  GAY MARRIAGE THIS IS LIKE GOING TO ISRAEL AFTER YOU KILL HITLER. (LAUGHTER) IT IS LIKE GOING TO BURNING MAN AFTER LEGALIZING POT.
Jon: IS GAY MARRIAGE SUCH AN IMPORTANT SOCIAL ISSUE FOR THE HOLLYWOOD ELITE? (LAUGHTER)
A SOCIAL ISSUE FOR OT HOLLYWOOD ELITE, GAY MARRIAGE, RIGHT NOW IN  GEORGE CLOONEY'S HOUSE, ELTON JOHN IS SWINGING FROM A CHANDELIER SIPPING CHAMPAGNE OFF THE PEANUTS OF A NAKED GLADIATOR ICE SCULPTURE. AND THAT IS THE STRAIGHTEST THING I SAW IN THERE. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: THAT SEEMS LOCATE A BIT OF A STEREOTYPE OF HOLLYWOOD.
STEREOTYPE OF HOLLYWOOD (LAUGHTER) STEREOTYPE, START FOR THE REASON, JON. THIS WHOLE TOWN IS THE HEDON HEDONISTIC JOBLESS NIGHTMARE MIDDLE AMERICA ALWAYS SUSPECTED IT WAS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE I TOOK. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. CHECK THIS OUT. COME ON. LOOK AT THAT. (LAUGHTER) IT IS LIKE EYES [BLEEP] SHUT IN THERE.
Jon: LET ME SEE THAT AGAIN. IS THAT RIGHT THERE, IS THAT --
YES, THAT IS SEAN PENN DOING A-- WITH CASTRO.
Jon: WAIT, LET ME SEE THAT AGAIN, AM I WRONG-- HOLY  [BLEEP] IS THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN.
WHAT, NO, NO OF COURSE NOT, THAT'S NOT-- OBAMA KILLED HIM. WE ALL KNOW THAT. THAT'S JUST CHRISTIAN BALE, PREPARING FOR A ROLE, THAT GUY'S METHOD.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH, AT LEAST HOLLYWOOD SLIVING THEIR VALUES. I SEE A LOT OF PRIUSES PARKED OUT BEHIND YOU THAT IS FOR SOMETHING.
THOSE ARE JUST FOR DRIVING AROUND THE GROUNDS. THE VEHICLES THEY CAME IN ARE PARKED IN THE WEST LOT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF ACTUALLY DID ARRIVE IN PRIUS ONE.
Jon: THAT IS PRINCIPALLED.
SORT OF T IS JUST A PRIUS STRAPPED TO AIR FORCE ONE.
Jon: BUT IT GENERATES A TON OF MONEY HERE.
YES, HE IS. BUT YOU KNOW, MOST IMPORTANTLY T ALMOST DIDN'T HAPPEN. THESE PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO COOL ON HIM. BUT THAT GAY MARRIAGE SPEECH CHANGED EVERYTHING. TO PUT IT IN HOLLYWOOD TERMS, THIS WAS HIS "PULP FICTION". HIS BIG JOHN TRAVOLTA COMEBACK. AND JUST LIKE WITH TRAVOLTA THERE IS NO WAY THIS DOESN'T HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.
Jon: REALLY, JILLION, JASON.
I KNOW, TOP KARBLTION THEY BROKE THAT, THE DUDES THERE TWO OF THEM.
Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
