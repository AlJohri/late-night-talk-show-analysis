DECEMBER 6, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW" WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)   Captioning sponsored by     COMEDY CENTRAL
Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"! MY NAME IS JON STEWART! YOU'RE VERY KIND. HOW MANY PEOPLE GET THIS WHEN THEY GO TO WORK, REALLY? I DON'T EVEN GET THIS WHEN I GO HOME. I NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY GO AND WARM UP MY FAMILY FOR WHEN I GET HOME. WHEN I GET HOME "DAD!" MY GUEST TONIGHT, JONAH HILL. FRIENDS... FRIENDS-- AND I SAY THAT NOT REALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE WHO'S WATCHING-- FRIEND, IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN. HOLIDAY MAGIC. THE TWINNING OF LIGHTS, THE NOTHING OF EGGS AND, OF COURSE, ANGER AND BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.
RHODE ISLAND GOVERNOR LINCOLN CHAFEE COMING UNDER FIRE AFTER  REFUSING TO CALL THE TREE IN THE RHODE ISLAND STATEHOUSE A CHRISTMAS TREE.
Jon: HE INSISTS PEOPLE CALL IT THE DEVIL'S PINE! (LAUGHTER) SATAN'S SPRUCE! A TREE BORTION. (LAUGHTER) IT'S FOX'S WAR ON CHRISTMAS! IT'S BACK, BABY. AND THIS YEAR'S DESIGNATED KROOJ, RHODE ISLAND GOVERNOR AND PART TIME STEVE DOOCY IMPERSONATOR... (LAUGHTER). LINCOLN CHAFEE. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO CHAFEE HAD THE AUDACITY TO INVITE AMERICANS TO A "TREE LIGHTING."  OR, JUDGING BY THE REACTION, A JESUS TIPPING.
IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE. KEEP CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS.
FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW AND THINKING THAT'S  CRAY SHIRKS I SHOULD CALL THE GOVERNOR. WE'VE GOT HIS PHONE NUMBER.
IT HAS LIGHTS AND ORNAMENTS AND A DECORATION ON TOP, IT'S A CHRISTMAS TREE.
FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS BEFORE THIS GOVERNOR, YOUR FORMER GOVERNOR IN FACT DID CALL  IT A CHRISTMAS TREE, RIGHT?
HE DID, GRETCHEN.
Jon: YES, AND WHILE THAT'S NOT TRUE... (LAUGHTER). WHO CARES? IT MAKES THEM ANGRY. SEE, THE PREVIOUS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR'S 2009 INVITATION TO THIS VERY SAME CEREMONY ALSO  USES THE OFFENDING PHRASE "HOLIDAY TREE LIGHTING!" I MEAN, SOMEHOW THAT NOT AKIN TO  WIPING YOUR ASS WITH THE SHROUD OF TURIN? I MEAN, REALLY. (LAUGHTER) THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION, OBVIOUSLY. NOW, WHO CARES IF THE STORY IS TRUE OR WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS? THE IMPORTANT THING IS IS TO ALLOW THIS HEATHEN GOVERNOR TO DEFILE A SACRED RITUAL... RITUAL  RITUAL. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS COMBINING THAT WORD WITH. TO ALLOW HIM TO DEFILE A SACRED RITUAL. (LAUGHTER) IT'S TO IMPERIL OUR NATION'S VERY FOUNDING PRINCIPLES.
WHY DO THESE PILGRIMS BRAVE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS TO LIVE HERE, DIE HERE, AND TO  TRY TO START A NEW WAY OF LIFE FOR THEPTSES?
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE.
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
AND NOW IT'S ON THE ROCKS.
Jon: YES. YES, LADY WEARING CROSS ON TELEVISION. (LAUGHTER) RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS ON THE ROCKS! THE ROCKS! OF COURSE, NOT AS ON THE ROCKS AS IT WAS IN THE 17th CENTURY WHEN YOUR FRIENDS THE  PILGRIMS OUTLAWED CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS AS A SACRILEGE AND DECLARED GIFTS AND CHRISTMAS  DECORATIONS SATAN CAL, LEVYING A FIVE-SHILLING FINE ON ANYONE FOR SAYING MERRY CHRISTMAS. FIVE SHILLINGS. I MEAN, IN THOSE DAYS THAT'S TWO MILK COWS AND A BUCKLED HAT. (LAUGHTER) IF THE PILGRIMS WERE ALIVE TODAY, THIS IS HOW THEY'D DECORATE THE TOWN SQUARE. (LAUGHTER) OR PERHAPS YOU'D PREFER TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS THE WAY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DID?
ON DECEMBER 25, 1789, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS SAT IN SESSION AND CONTINUED TO STAY  OPEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY FOR MOST OF THE NEXT 67 YEARS.
Jon: HOW'S THAT TASTE, MOTHER (BLEEP)ERS? (LAUGHTER) THAT'S RIGHT! WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED, CONGRESS HAD EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE ABOUT THE SANCTITY OF CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS THAT A  7-ELEVEN DOES TODAY. YEAH, WE'RE OPEN. FOX, YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED THE UBIQUITY OF CHRISTMAS. BUT IF THERE HAS BEEN A WAR, CHRISTMAS IS THE AGGRESSOR NATION. RIGHT NOW EVERY PUBLIC SPACE IN THE COUNTRY LOOKS LIKE IT GOT HIT WITH A 500-POUND TINSEL BOMB. THE WHITE HOUSE LOOKS LIKE A YULETIDE EPISODE OF HOARDERS." (LAUGHTER)  MANY OF THESE DISPLAYS ARE SUBSIDIZED BY... WHAT'S THAT THING YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND ON ANYTHING? TAXPAYER MONEY! YOU WANT TO FIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING TAKING THE CHRIST OUT OF CHRISTMAS? ♪ ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU... ♪ (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  WHATEVER YOU THINK IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON, IT DOES NOT INVOLVE MARIAH CAREY IN A HALF A  SANTA SUIT PRESENTING HER ASS TO JUSTIN BIEBER LIKE A HORNY BONO BOW. (LAUGHTER) BY THE WAY, WHAT IF WE ALL DID GO BACK TO ALWAYS CALLING THEM  AS CHRISTMAS TREES AND SAYING "MERRY CHRISTMAS"? WOULD THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
THE GOOD NEWS IS, NOW SOME RETAILERS ARE GOING BACK TO  USING THE WORD "CHRISTMAS" AGAIN, BUT ARE THEY DOING IT JUST TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK? AND IF SO, ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
Jon: WE CAN'T WIN. (LAUGHTER) I MEAN, SURE THEY'RE SAYING "MERRY CHRISTMAS" BUT DO THEY MEAN IT? AND THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO MEAN IT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT JESUS IS THEIR SAVIOR? THAT IS WHY TONIGHT I MUST MAKE THE HARDEST DECISION THAT ANY ANCHOR OF A FAKE NEWS PROGRAM  HAS TO MAKE. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) THEY'RE UNUSUALLY BOISTEROUS FOR AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF WAR. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, TONIGHT I HUMBLY COME BEFORE YOU TO DECLARE WAR ON CHRISTMAS. WE DID NOT... SURE. WE DID NOT ASK FOR THIS WAR, BUT NEITHER WILL WE SHRINK FROM IT. IT IS SAID THAT WE PROVOKED THESE HOSTILITIES THROUGH OUR USE OF THE PHRASE "HAPPY  HOLIDAYS." THIS IS A LIE. THAT WAS A PHRASE BORNE NOT OF AGGRESSION BUT OF CONVENIENCE. BUT AS LONG AS OUR ENEMIES VIEW THE WORD HAPPY HOLIDAYS NOT AS A WAY TO AVOID THE TIME SUCKING  DOUBLE SALUTATION "I WISH YOU A HEARRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW  YEAR" BUT RATHER AS A SUBTEX WALL "(BLEEP) YOU AND YOUR BABY  JESUS" THERE CAN BE NO PEACE! (LAUGHTER) WE NOW ASK THAT CHRISTMAS IMMEDIATELY AND UNILATERALLY  WITHDRAW TO ITS PRE-'67 BORDERS. PRE1667 BORDERS. DO THIS NOW. THAT WAS MY NIXON! NO! NO! YOU DON'T DESERVE MY NIXON. (LAUGHTER). (LAUGHTER) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) DO THIS NOW OR FACE THE FULL NIGHT OF OUR SECULAR  MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. IT'S A... NO, THAT'S NOT A PRESIDENT. IT'S A WORLD WHERE CHRISTMAS WILL HAVE TO SHARE STATEHOUSE ROTUNDAS NOT JUST WITH JEWS BUT  WITH HINDUS, BUDDHISTS, WICCANS, SANTERIA, ATHEISTS AND, OF COURSE, MUSLIMS. (LAUGHTER) WE WILL FIGHT UNTIL WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE FREE AMERICANS  EVERYWHERE SEEK NOT VALIDATION OF THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS THROUGH MACY'S SIGNAGE. WHERE NONSECTARIAN GREETINGS ARE NOT SEEN AS DIMINISHING THE THE MOST UBIQUITOUS TWO-MONTH  HOLIDAY IMMERSION SINCE CALIGULA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. (LAUGHTER) UNTIL THAT DAY, I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IN THIS SEASON A  HAPPY AND HEART FELT END OF THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
