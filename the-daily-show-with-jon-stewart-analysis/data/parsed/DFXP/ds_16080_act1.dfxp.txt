JUNE 21, 2011. FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS  IS "THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART." CAPTIONING SPONSORED BY COMEDY CENTRAL  [THEME SONG PLAYING] [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAIL SHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART. OUR GUEST TONIGHT, DR. CAMERON DIAZ. THAT WILL MAKE SENSE LATER ON IN THE PROGRAM. YOU WILL SEE. SHE HAS GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO PERFORM A SURGICAL PROCEDURE ON... [LAUGHTER] ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAM. A QUICK WORD BEFORE WE GET GOING TO THE TOURIST COMMUNITY, TO THE VISITORS TO THIS GREAT LAND OF OURS. IF YOU'VE BEEN HERE EIGHT MONTHS, YOU LIVE HERE. YOU LIVE HERE. YOU'RE NOT FROM VENEZUELA. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] DONDE ESTA YOU'RE MINE. SEVEN YEARS OF SPANISH, ALL I REMEMBER. [LAUGHTER] DONDE ESTA. LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT PERHAPS IN AMERICA, THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY, WHERE THE STREETS  ARE PAVED WITH LET'S SAY CINNABUNS. [LAUGHTER] AND YET WE ARE NATION BESIEGED WITH PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS WE MUST SOLVE. PROBLEM NUMBER ONE, OUR GOOEY, RAT-INFESTED CINNABUN-PAVED STREETS. WHY DID WE DO THAT? THAT WAS A DOPEY MATERIAL TO PAVE OUR STREETS WITH. [LAUGHTER] WE'RE GOING TO NEED COMMON-SENSE SOLUTIONS TO OUR PROBLEMS IF  WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO WIN THE FUTURE BUT MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE ELSE LOSES IT. [LAUGHTER] LET'S START WITH A SIMPLE PROBLEM: MEXICAN DRUG CARTELS. [LAUGHTER] THEY'RE ENGAGED IN A BLOODY CAMPAIGN OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, OFTEN FUELED BY  ASSAULTED RIFLES. THEIR GUN RUNNERS CROSS OUR BORDERS TO EASILY PURCHASE. I ASSUME A COUPLE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE IMPROVE OUR BORDER SECURITY, RESTRICT RIFLE  SALES TO NON-MEXICAN DRUG CAR TELL MEMBERS. [LAUGHTER] LET'S SEE WHAT OUR OWN BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO & FIREARMS HAS COME UP WITH.
IT'S A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM CALLED "OPERATION FAST AND FURIOUS."
U.S. FIREARMS AGENTS SAY SUPERIOR OFFICERS SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM NOT TO INTERVENE AS  THEY SECRETLY WATCHED WHILE GUN RUNNERS PURCHASED ILLEGAL FIREARMS IN THE UNITED STATES  AND SENT THEM TO MEXICO.
THE A.T.F. OFFICIALS THOUGHT, IF WE COULD JUST TRACK THESE GUNS AND SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING, MAYBE WE CAN ARREST THE  CARTEL LEADERS WHO ARE USING THESE GUNS.
Jon: MAYBE. [LAUGHTER] OR... [LAUGHTER] SO ONCE THESE DRUG CARTEL RUNNERS TOOK THE GUNS TO MEXICO, HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUNS?
I CAN TELL YOU THAT AFTER A TRIP TO RADIOSHACK WITH A.T.F. FUNDS, I MYSELF MANUFACTURED A G.P.S. TRACKING DEVICE THAT WOULD FIT INSIDE THE HANDLING OF  AN A.K. VARIANT RIFLE. [LAUGHTER]
Jon: JON STEWART, "THE DAILY SHOW." I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION. AS A FREQUENT RADIOSHACK CUSTOMER, I MAY BE QUALIFIED TO TELL YOU WHAT MAY BE AN ISSUE  WITH YOUR PLAN, BUT GO AHEAD.
THE PROBLEM WITH IT WAS THE LIMITED BATTERY LIFE. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
Jon: SEE, THE BATTERIES AT RADIOSHACK ARE DESIGNED TO WORK WITH ONE OF THOSE LITTLE REMOTE  CONTROL HELICOPTERS THAT WORK... ONCE. [LAUGHTER] SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THE G.P.S. TRACKING SYSTEM FOR THE ASSAULT RIFLES WE SOLD MEXICAN CARTELS DIDN'T WORK, HOW DO WE FIND OUT  WHERE THE GUNS ARE? WHAT IS PLAN "B"?
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THOSE GUNS IN MEXICO IS WHERE?
AT CRIME SCENES IN WHICH EITHER THE BAD GUY WAS KILLED AND HIS GUN WAS LEFT AT THE  SCENE OR USED DURING THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME IN WHICH THE GUN WAS LEFT BEHIND.
Jon: OKAY. [LAUGHTER] SO OUR PLAN TO PREVENT AMERICAN GUNS FROM BEING USED IN MEXICAN GANG VIOLENCE IS TO PROVIDE  MEXICAN GANGS AMERICAN GUNS. [LAUGHTER] TO USE ACCORDING TO OUR PLAN. [LAUGHTER] HOW EXACTLY DID WE CONVINCE THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TO COOPERATE  IN THIS, LET'S CALL IT "A PLAN."
THEY WEREN'T COOPERATING PARTLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. THEY WERE NEVER INFORMED THAT THIS OPERATION WAS TAKING PLACE. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]
Jon: IF MEXICO ISN'T COOPERATING, EVEN IF THERE WAS VIOLENCE WHERE THE GUNS WAS LEFT  BEHIND, HOW WOULD WE FIND... YOU KNOW WHAT, NEVER MIND. IF THIS IS THE PLAN THAT THEY WENT WITH, WHAT PLAN DID WE REJECT? [LAUGHTER] HEY, I GOT IT, LET'S PUT A TINY MICROPHONE IN EVERY BULLET. [LAUGHTER] AND WE HOPE THAT WHEN THE BAD GUYS, THE CRIMINALS, YOU KNOW, WHEN THRIER SHOOTING PEOPLE, THEY SAY THEIR NAME, LIKE NOBODY  [BLEEPED] WITH ALONZO GUTIERREZ. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I'M GOING TO ASSUME THIS WAS SOME LITTLE-BRAIN, GIANT-BALLS IDEA COMING OUT OF THE A.T.F. OFFICE. THE A.T.F.'S RESPONSIBLE ADULTS LIKE THEIR ACTING DIRECTOR KEN MELSON, HE DIDN'T KNOW.
MEMOS RELEASED LAST WEEK SHOW THAT MELSON NOT ONLY KNEW ABOUT  OPERATION "FAST AND FURIOUS," BUT HE GOT WEEKLY BRIEFINGS.
THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE A.T.F. HAS SET UP A VIDEO FEED IN HIS OFFICE SO HE COULD WATCH  SOME OF THOSE STRAW BUYS TAKING PLACE.
Jon: YOU'RE BAITING ME. [LAUGHTER] SO THE HEAD OF THE A.T.F. DIDN'T JUST KNOW ABOUT THIS PLAN, HE WAS TIVO-ING IT. [LAUGHTER] WELL, NOT TO WORRY, FOLKS, THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION, AND  THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, OF WHICH THE A.T.F. IS A SUBSIDIARY, IS FULLY COOPERATING WITH IT. THEY HANDED IN A 900-PAGE REPORT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE DETAILING THE ENTIRE BUYING OF  ASSAULT RIFLES OPERATION.
SIR, IF YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT PAGES LIKE THIS AS DISCOVERY, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. THE PAGES GO ON LIKE THIS FOREVER. YOU HAVE GIVEN US BLACK PAPER INSTEAD OF WHITE PAPER. YOU MIGHT OF WELL HAS GIVEN US A REAM STILL IN ITS ORIGINAL BINDER.
Jon: WHAT? NO, NO, YOU DON'T GET IT. YOU'RE UPSET? THEY GAVE YOU... THOSE ARE PRIZED MONDRIANS FROM HIS FAMED BLACK PERIOD. THEY'RE PRICELESS. I MEAN WORTHLESS. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S CHECK SOMETHING. IF WE RUN A GRAPHICS FILTER TO REMOVE THE REDACTION, MAYBE WE CAN SEE WHAT THE D.O.J. IS HIDING. AH. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
