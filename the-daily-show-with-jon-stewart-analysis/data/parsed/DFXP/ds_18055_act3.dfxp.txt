WELCOME BACK. MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS A  FORMER CHANCELLOR OF THE  WASHINGTON D.C. PUBLIC SCHOOL. HER NEW BOOK IS CALLED RADICAL,  FIGHTING TO PUT STUDENTS FIRST. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM  MICHELLE RHEE. WELCOME TO THE SHOW. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD. Jon: RADICAL. PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST. IT'S SO INTERESTING. YOU INSPIRE SUCH... PEOPLE  EITHER LOVE YOU OR THEY'RE REAL  MAD AT YOU. YOU'RE SOMEWHAT OF A  CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE. DOES THAT... DO YOU FEEL THAT? DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST WENT  TO D.C. AND BECAME THE  CHANCELLOR THERE, IT WAS THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOL  DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY. I STARTED MAKING A LOT OF  CHANGES THAT I FELT WERE OBVIOUS  ONES. CLOSE LOW-PERFORMING SCHOOLS. CUT THE CENTRAL OFFICE  BUREAUCRACY. REMOVE INEFFECTIVE EDUCATORS. I WAS A LITTLE SHOCKED WHEN  PEOPLE STARTED SAYING SHE'S A  LIGHTNING ROD AND A RADICAL. BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHAT I WAS  DOING WAS JUST SORT OF BRINGING,  YOU KNOW, ORDER AND REASON TO THE SYSTEM. SO, YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE  DAY I FEEL LIKE IT'S BRINGING  COMMON SENSE TO A DYSFUNCTIONAL SYSTEM MAKES ME A RADICAL THEN  I'M OKAY BEING A RADICAL. I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ONE. (  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
Jon: SURE. NOW, DO YOU THINK... SEE, I AM  THE SON OF A TEACHER. SO I'M NOT... IT'S HARD TO BE  OBJECTIVE ABOUT IT. DO YOU THINK SOME OF PEOPLE'S  CONCERN IS WHAT YOU MIGHT  CONSIDER AND OBVIOUS YOU SAY FIRED INEFFECTIVE TEACHERS,  CLOSE SOME DYSFUNCTIONAL SCHOOLS  THAT THEY MIGHT BE CONCERNED THAT THE METRICS WITH WHICH  THOSE ARE DECIDED IN THEIR MINDS  MIGHT BE MORE ARBITRARY NOT TO SUGGEST THAT ISN'T A TERRIBLE  BUREAUCRACY IN SCHOOLS OR THERE  ISN'T ANY OF THOSE THINGS BUT THE RELIANCE ON THE TESTING  METRIC SKEWED SOME OF THE DATA  FOR PEOPLE AND THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THOSE DECISIONS  WERE BEING BASED ON ARBITRARY  SYSTEM THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH?
I COME FROM TEACHERS TOO. MY GRANDFATHER WAS AN EDUCATOR. MY GRANDMOTHER ON MY MOTHER'S  SIDE. I HAVE FOUR AUNTS. MY BEST FRIEND. MY SISTER-IN-LAW. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED BY  TEACHERS MY ENTIRE LIFE. THAT'S WHY I HAVE SUCH AN  INCREDIBLE REGARD FOR WHAT  TEACHERS CAN DO BUT WHEN I GOT TO D.C., I WAS LEADING A SYSTEM  WHERE 8% OF THE 8th GRADERS  IN THE CITY SCHOOLS WERE OPERATING ON GRADE LEVEL IN  MATHEMATICS WHEN I GOT THERE. YET WHEN I LOOKED AT THE  PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF THE  ADULTS AT THE SAME TIME 98% OF THEM WERE BEING WRITTEN AS DOING  AN EXCELLENT JOB. YOU CAN'T RUN AN EFFECTIVE  ORGANIZATION WHEN YOU HAVE THAT  KIND OF A DISCONNECT BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, WHAT PEOPLE ARE  SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AND THE  RESULTS THAT WE'RE PRODUCING FOR  KIDS. NOW I THINK THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT  TODAY'S TEACHER EVALUATION  SYSTEM ARE BROKEN. THERE'S A MOVE NOW TO FIX THEM. A LOT OF TEACHERS ARE WORRIED  ABOUT THE USE OF TEST SCORES AND  WHETHER THAT IS FAIR OR NOT. I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE GOT TO  DO IS FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM THAT  DOES... IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT FOR TEACHERS BUT AT THE SAME  TIME DOES HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE  FOR THE ACADEMIC GROWTH WE SEE WITH KIDS
Jon: THIS IS INTERESTING. FROM ANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS I  HAVE WITH TEACHERS THEY ALL TALK  ABOUT THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THIS IDEA OF THE TEST  BEING THE ALL MIGHTY WORD. THAT THERE IS A MATH AND READING  METRIC THAT IS ESTABLISHED BY  THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT IN  NY... ANY WAY MEASURE AA  POSSIBLE STUDENT'S POTENTIAL OR SUCCESS, A POSSIBLE TEACHER'S  POTENTIAL SUCCESS. YET THAT IS THE THING THEY ARE  TIED TO NOT JUST FOR THEIR  TEACHING CURRICULUM BUT FOR MONEY, FOR MONEY FOR THE SCHOOL,  FOR ALL THESE THINGS. HOW DO WE, AS YOU SAY, HOW DO WE  MOVE THEM FROM WHAT THEY'VE  ESTABLISHED HERE BECAUSE THAT'S VERY RECENT, TO WHAT YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT, IF WHAT YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE TEST
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THERE HAS  TO BE A BALANCE. YOU DON'T WANT AN OVEREMPHASIS  ON THE TEST. IF THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT  PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. YET YOU CAN'T HAVE NO  ACCOUNTABILITY, RIGHT? BECAUSE WE FOR A VERY LONG TIME  IN CITIES LIKE WASHINGTON D.C. AND PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY,  WE WERE PRODUCING GENERATIONS OF  KIDS WHO WERE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW  HOW TO READ AND WRITE AND DO  MATH ON GRADE LEVEL. SO THERE'S GOT TO BE A BALL  AFTERNOONS IN THERE. AND SORT OF A FAIRNESS IN THERE  ABOUT IT. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT  THERE IS NO ONE IN THE COUNTRY  THAT I KNOW OF WHO IS ADVOCATING THAT WE EVALUATE TEACHERS SOLELY  ON THE BASIS OF TEST SCORES. I THINK THAT THE VAST MAJORITY  OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REFORMERS ARE  SAYING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GROWTH BUT  WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER  METRICS AND MEASURES LIKE OBSERVATIONS OF THEIR CLASSROOM  PRACTICE. SURVEYS OF KIDS IN THEIR  CLASSROOM AND THE PARENTS WHO  SEND THEIR KIDS INTO THAT CLASSROOM EVERYDAY
Jon: ARE WE HANGING THEM OUT  TO DRY BY COMING IN THERE EVERY  THREE YEARS AND SAYING HERE'S THE NEW REFORM. IT'S THE TEST. YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH TO THAT. IF YOU DON'T INCREASE YOUR TEST  SCORES BY 10% YOU'RE FIRED. AND THEN TWO YEARS LATER COME  BACK IN AND GO NOT THAT TEST,  THIS TEST. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DEMORALIZED. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY... IT'S LIKE  A FOOTBALL TEAM THAT KEEPS  GETTING A NEW OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR EVERY YEAR. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE  INSPIRED BY THAT. SCHOOLS ARE AS MUCH AN ART FORM. TEACHING IS AS MUCH AN ART FORM  AS IT IS AN OBJECTIVE REALITY
SO I REMEMBER TALK TO GO A  TEACHER WHEN I WAS IN D.C. ONCE. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M A GOOD SOLDIER. I'M NOT A RABBLE ROUSER. I JUST WANT TO DO THE RIGHT  THING FOR YOU, FOR THE KIDS, THE  DISTRICT. CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU  WANT ME TO DO BECAUSE I HAVE  THIS HUGE STATE CURRICULUM. I HAVE ALL THESE LEARNING  STANDARDS. THEN I HAVE THE STANDARDIZED  TESTS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE AND  THESE BENCHMARK ASSESSMENTS AND THE TEACHERS GUIDE AND THE, YOU  KNOW, THE EVERYDAY... ALL THESE  THINGS. JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO  DO AND I'LL DO IT. RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST SO MUCH  STUFF. I THINK THAT IS A FRUSTRATION. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH  OUR EDUCATORS ABOUT WHAT GREAT  TEACHING AND LEARNING LOOKS LIKE, WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE WHEN  WE INTO THEIR CLASSROOM
Jon: THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SEEMS  TO HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM ANY  PRACTICAL REALITY IN THE MODERN  WORLD. THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY INNOVATION  IN EDUCATION SINCE JOHN DEWEY  BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S THAT IDEA THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE A  CONNECTION TO THE WAY THE REAL  WORLD WORKS AND THE WAY SCHOOLS SHOULD WORK IN COMMUNITIES. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A MUCH LARGER  PROBLEM. TEACHERS SEEM LIKE ONE TOOL. WITH WHICH TO GET EDUCATION IN  THIS COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK. BUT THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY  TOOL THAT EVER GETS YELL AT. I JUST RUINED MY OWN METAPHOR. I HAD THE WHOLE TOOL THING  WORKING.
HAMMERED  Jon: EXACTLY. ALL KINDS OF... POVERTY, FAMILY  STUFF. COMMUNITIES. BUT TEACHERS ARE THE ONLY ONE WE  LOOK AT AND GO, SO, FIX IT. OR YOU'RE FIRED.
I THINK THAT THE REASON WHY  PEOPLE ARE PAYING SO MUCH  ATTENTION TO TEACHERS AND TEACHER QUALITY IS BECAUSE THE  RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR THAT IF  ALL OF THE IN-SCHOOL FACTORS THAT EXIST, IT'S THE QUALITY OF  TEACHER IN FRONT OF THE  CLASSROOM EVERY DAY THAT HAS THE MOST IMPACT ON STUDENTS' LIVES. DOES POVERTY MATTER? ABSOLUTELY. THAT MAKES IT MUCH MORE  CHALLENGING FOR KIDS TO COME  INTO SCHOOL EVERYDAY, FOR  TEACHERS TO TEACH THEM EFFECTIVELY BUT THE REALITY IS  THAT IF WE WANT TO LIVE UP TO  THE IDEALS OF THIS COUNTRY, THE VALUES OF AMERICA AND WE WANT  THOSE KIDS ONE DAY TO BE ABLE TO  ESCAPE POVERTY WE KNOW THAT THE BEST TOOL TO DO THAT IS THROUGH  EDUCATION. THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE  SURE THAT EVERY KID HAS A GREAT  TEACHER IN FRONT OF THEM EVERYDAY
Jon: IF YOU COULD STICK  AROUND FOR A LITTLE, IT SEEMS  LIKE EDUCATION CAN ONLY BE PUT IN PLACE ONCE THE SOIL IS  FERTILE. IF THE SOIL IS NOT FERTILE, YOU  KNOW, TEACHING IN A BARREN  ENVIRONMENT IS STILL A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE TO GROW TOOLS. RADICAL. IT'S ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW. WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE  WITH MICHELLE
