FROM COMEDY CENTRAL'S WORLD NEWS HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK THIS IS THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART. GOOD SHOW TONIGHT, MY GUEST TONIGHT, A YOUNG MAN NAMED BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN--  (CHEERS, AUDIENCE SAYS "BRUCE"!) YOU HEAR WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHTS THERE? THEY'RE NOT SAYING BRUCE, THEY'RE SAYING FRANK CARUSO, WHO IS THE OTHER GENTLEMAN WHO IS HERE TONIGHT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THEIR NEW BOOK "OUTLAW PETE" BUT FIRST, I HAVE UNBELIEVABLY EXCITING NEWS. GENTLEMEN WHO ARE WEARING SAILOR SUITS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK FOR THE NEAREST NURSE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE WAR ON ISIS MAY BE TURNING FOR THE ALLIED POWERS.
ISIS LEADER ABU BAKR AL BAGHDADI POSSIBLY KILLED IN THE LATEST U.S.-LED AIR STRIKES IN IRAQ.
Jon: BOOM! LITERALLY. (LAUGHTER) LOOKS LIKE OBAMA IS GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK OUT A NEW I JUST KILLED BAGHDADI HALLWAY WALK. MIGHT I RECOGNIZE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE PSYCHEDELIC, A LITTLE MORE-- WILLY WONKA. IT'S NOT IMPORTANT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS. THE LEADER OF ISIS IS DEAD
IRAQI OFFICIALS ARE SAYING AL BAGHDADI WAS CRITICALLY WOUNDED IN AN AIR STRIKE THIS WEEKEND.
Jon: OR WOUNDED. HE'S DEAD OR WOUNDED. NOT QUITE DEAD, BUT THAT'S NOT NOTHING. HE'S NOT IN HELL YET, BUT HE IS ON THE HIGHWAY TO HELL! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. LET'S GET SOME INFORMATION. WHERE DID WE NAIL HIM? WHERE DID WE NAIL HIM?
ACCORDING TO THE U.S., AN AIR STRIKE WAS CONDUCTED TARGETING AN ISIS CONVOY OUTSIDE OF MOSUL.
AN INTERIOR MINISTRY INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL CLAIMS THE STRIKE IN THE TOWN OF QAIM.
Jon: THE IMPORTANT THING IS THOUGH WE KILLED OR CRITICALLY INJURED BAGHDADI SOMEWHERE IN THAT AREA.
IT'S STILL A BIG MYSTERY TO U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIALS WHETHER THE LEADER OF ISIS ABU BAKR AL BAGHDADI WAS ACTUALLY IN A CONVOY THAT WAS STRUCK SATURDAY NIGHT. (LAUGHTER)
Jon: HOW FITTING. (LAUGHTER) THAT THE UNITED STATES IN A BOMBING RAID SOMEWHERE AROUND QAIM OR MOSUL HAS KILLED OR INJURED THE LEADER OF ISIS OR SOME OTHER [BLEEP] GUY. WHO WAS MAYBE JUST TRYING TO BEAT THE RUSH-HOUR TRAFFIC BETWEEN MOSUL AND QAIM AND HAD AN OLD ISIS SHIRT STUFFED WITH NEWSPAPERS SO HE COULD USE THE H-O-V LANE. NOT EXACTLY FRONT PAGE NEWS. MORE OF A MILITARY BLIND ITEM. HOW DID THIS STORY GET SO MURKY?
TURNS OUT IT WAS A TWEET THAT SET OFF RUMORS OF BAGHDADI'S INJURIES.
THIS TWEET, ORIGINAL TWEET WAS ALLEGEDLY FROM THE ISIL SPOKESMAN, HOWEVER THAT WAS VERY QUICKLY DENIED BY OTHER ISIL SOURCES WHO SAID THAT THIS TWITTER ACCOUNT WAS RUN BY JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE.
Jon: GREAT, NO, SO WE THINK WE KILLED BAGHDADI BECAUSE JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE IS CATFISHING ISIS, THAT'S JUST GREAT. SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE TO ASSUME BAGHDADI IS BOTH DEAD AND NOT DEAD. THE PARADOX KNOWN AS SCHRODINGER'S TERRORISTS. LOOK, HOPEFULLY THIS WILL DISCOURAGE PEOPLE THOUGH NOW FROM JOINING ISIS.
FOREIGNERS LOOKING TO JOIN ISIS AND OTHER MILITANT GROUPSÃ‘i ARE NOW TRAVELING BY CRUISE SHIP TO AVOID AIRPORT  SECURITY (LAUGHTER)
Jon: WE ARE TRULY SCREWED. BECAUSE IF THESE PEOPLE ARE SO COMMITTED TO JIHAD THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING, INCLUDING GOING ON A CRUISE SHIP. (LAUGHTER) AND BECOMING INMATES ON A FLOATING POOP PRISON, INTERESTING CHOICE, THE CRUISE SHIP. I MEAN THERE'S OBVIOUSLY DOWNSIDES, THE PATH TO JIHAD IS GONNA BE LONGER. YOU HAVE ALL THOSE STOPS, VARIOUS PORTS OF CALL. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE YOUR HATRED OF INFIDELS WITH THE LURE OF DUTY FREE. AND WHEN YOU FINALLY REACH THE TERROR CAMP, THERE WILL BE NO HIDING THOSE GLORIOUS EIGHT DAYS AND SEVEN NIGHTS. (LAUGHTER) WE CAN'T TRUST TERRORISTS TO STAY DEAD, WE CAN'T TRUST CRUISE SHIPS IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN TRUST IN THIS FIGHT.
I WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS EFFORT WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM THE WARS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. IT WILL NOT INVOLVE AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS FIGHTING ON FOREIGN SOIL.
Jon: YEAH. IF AMERICAN TROOPS ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING. THEY'RE GOING TO BE FIGHTING ON OUR SOIL AGAINST--  (LAUGHTER) WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS COMFORTING TO HEAR OUR PRESIDENT SAY ON NATIONAL TELEVISION THERE WILL BE NO COMBAT TROOPS IN IRAQ.
TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA AUTHORIZED THE DEPLOYMENT OF 1500 MORE U.S. TROOPS TO IRAQ TO HELP IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.
WITH THIS EXPANSION, THE NUMBER AUTHORIZED HAS GROWN FROM 275 IN JUNE TO 3100 TONIGHT.
Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]. YOU SAID NO TROOPS-- AND IN FIVE MONTHS WE'VE INCREASED U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ BY TEN TIMES. AT THAT RATE, BY 2016, EVERYONE ON EARTH WILL BE IN IRAQ FIGHTING ISIS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECRUIT PEOPLE FROM ISIS TO FIGHT ISIS.
AND THOSE TROOPS ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. YOU SAID NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THE GROUND WOULD GET NO BOOTS!
THE AMERICAN FORCES THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED TO IRAQ DO NOT AND WILL NOT HAVE A COMBAT MISSION. THEIR MISSION IS TO ADVISE AND ASSIST OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND.
Jon: OH, I'M SORRY, THAT WAS MY MISTAKE. I'M SORRY. SO IT'S NOT 3,000 TROOPS, IT'S 3,000 ADVISORS. OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A LOT OF ADVICE. (LAUGHTER) I FEEL LIKE AFTER THE FIRST 2,000 GIVE THEIR INPUT, IT'S MOSTLY GOING TO BE LIKE "YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT TONY SAID." YOU KNOW, MAYBE, MAYBE THE PENTAGON CAN SPIN THIS A BIT BETTER.
LESS THAN HALF OF THEM WILL BE DEDICATED TO THE ADVISE AND ASSIST MISSION. AND OF THAT NUMBER, AND IT'S AROUND 630 OR SO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT WILL BE ENABLERS FOR THE ADVISORS, LOGISTICS, COMMAND AND CONTROL, INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT FOR THEM.
Jon: OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. SO HALF OF THE TROOPS ARE ADVISORS. AND HALF OF THAT HALF ARE GOING TO BE ADVISOR ENABLERS. WHICH I GUESS IS STANDING BEHIND THE ADVISORS GOING, I DON'T KNOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD ADVICE TO ME. (LAUGHTER) I WOULD LISTEN TO THAT ADVICE IF I WAS-- OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GIVING THE ADVICE. I'M JUST A GENTLEMAN BEHIND HIM. I BELIEVE THIS IS ALL SOUNDING A LITTLE [BLEEP]. GOT ANYTHING [BLEEP]-ER?
THE REMAINDER OF THE NUMBER WHICH IS, I GUESS, ABOUT 870, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, THEY WILL BE DEDICATED TO THIS BUILDING PARTNER CAPACITY MISSION, TO THE HANDS-ON TRAINING.
Jon: YOU KNOW THE MORE OUT OF YOUR WAY YOU GO TO CALL THESE NOT BOOTS ON THE GROUND, THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO THINK THESE ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND SO NOW WE'RE GOING HAVE 3,000 TROOPS IN IRAQ AGAIN. CAN WE AT LEAST AGREE TO STOP IT RIGHT THERE BEFORE WE GET STUCK ALL THE WAY BACK INTO THE QUAGMIRE?
SHOULD WE EXPECT THAT MORE TROOPS MAY BE NEEDED BEFORE THIS IS OVER?
YOU KNOW, AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I'M NEVER GOING TO SAY NEVER.
Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME, SUIT UP OLD MAN! (LAUGHTER) THERE'S A PARTNER CAPACITY BUILDING MISSION IN FALLUJAH WE NEED YOUR ADVICE ON. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
