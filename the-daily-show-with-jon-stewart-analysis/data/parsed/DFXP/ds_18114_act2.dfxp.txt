WELCOME BACK. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT STANDING  UP FOR TRULY SHOCKING ABUSES BUT  IS THERE EVER A TIME TO PUT THAT WHISTLE AWAY AND SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP? AL MADRIGAL HAS THE ANSWER.
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE SHOCKING  UNDERCOVER VIDEOS FROM ANIMAL  RIGHTS ACTIVISTS INSIDE AMERICA'S FACTORY FARMS. NOW LAWMAKERS ARE DECIDING TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BY MAKING THESE VIDEOS ILLEGAL.
SEVERAL STATES ARE WORKING ON  LAWS TO OUTLAW THE SHOOTING OF  THESE VIDEOS. IN ONE CASE ACTIVISTS COULD BE  PUT ON A TERROR WATCH LIST.
EMILY MEREDITH FROM THE  ANIMAL AGRICULTURE ALLIANCE  EXPLAINS WHY.
WE WANT THE WHISTLE TO BE  BLOWN ON ANIMAL ABUSE.
UNFORTUNATELY GROUPS LIKE  PETA AND THE HUMANE SOCIETY ARE  GETTING VIDEO FOOTAGE AND SHOWING THAT VIDEO WITH A FALSE  NARRATIVE.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'RE PROTECTING THE ANIMALS  FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING  TO PROTECT THE ANIMALS.
YES. ACCORDING TO MEREDITH, WHAT  THESE ACTIVISTS ARE FILMING  OFTEN ISN'T EVEN ABUSE.
WHAT THEY'RE TAKING FOOTAGE  OF IS STANDARD INDUSTRY  PRACTICES. I SAW OPEN HEART SURGERY FOR THE  FIRST TIME I WOULD WANT TO KNOW  IF IT'S THE BEST SUCIALG ONIN THE WORLD.
IF YOU TAKE A JOB AT THE  SLAUGHTER HOUSE YOU'RE GOING TO  SEE SOME SLAUGHTER.
RIGHT. IT'S CALLED SLAUGHTER HOUSE. THAT'S WHAT WE DO
Reporter: UNLESS YOU'RE AN  EXPERT IT'S HARD TO TELL THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANYTHING. IS THIS GUY A TRAINED SURGEON OR  A MACHETE-WIELDING SERIAL  KILLER? WHO ARE THESE PURVEYORS?
WOULD MAY GO BY CODY ONE DAY  AND JIMMY THE NEXT. AND NOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE  GETTING ON TO THESE FARMS AND  TAKING VIDEO.
I SAT DOWN WITH ONE OF THESE  CODY-JIMMIES WHO IS TEARING THE  HEART OUT OF AMERICA'S  HEARTLAND.
MY NAME IS CODY. I'M A FORMER UNDERCOVER  INVESTIGATOR FOR THE HUMANE  SOCIETY OF THE U.S. AND MERCY FOR ANIMALS.
DO I LOOK LIKE A FARMER? NO. THEN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO [BLEEP] ME LIKE ONE?
THIS INDUSTRY IS INCAPABLE OF  SELF-REGULATION. ONLY AN INDUSTRY WITH SOMETHING  TO HIDE WOULD TRY TO SILENCE  WHISTLE BLOWERS AND KEEP CAMERAS  OUT.
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING  WRONG. STANDARD PRACTICE. YOU DIDN'T UNCOVER ANYTHING.
WHEN STANDARD PRACTICES  INCLUDE CUTTING OFF BEAKS AND  TAILS AND HORNS WITHOUT ANESTHESIA, SOMETHING BEING A  STANDARD PRACTICE DOESN'T MEAN  IT'S OKAY TO DO.
SADLY THESE LAWS WEREN'T IN  PLACE WHEN CRIMINAL WHISTLE  BLOWER CODY WENT UNDERCOVER WITHOUT EXPLICITLY TELLING THE  FARMER WHO HE WAS. THAT'S WHEN THE REAL TRAGEDY  OCCURRED.
THEY AIRED A NATIONAL STORY. THAT'S WHEN THE DISTRICT  ATTORNEY PICKED UP THE  INVESTIGATION AND ACTUALLY  CONVICTED ONE OF MY SUPERVISORS OF ANIMAL CRUELTY.
WHAT WAS THE SUPERVISOR  DOING?
BEATING THEM WITH A KRENCH,  THE CATS.
BECAUSE THEY DESERVED IT. WERE TRYING TO  BE FRIENDLY AND NUZZLE UP TO HIM  AS HE WAS WORKING.
IT HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TIME  IN THE OFFICE. IF AN INTERN COMES UP AND IS  TRYING TO TALK TO ME AND ASK ME  QUESTIONS ABOUT COMEDY, I BEAT THEM WITH A WRENCH.
THOSE ARE INTERNS. THEY CHOOSE TO BE THERE.
GOOD POINT. I NEEDED TO SEE ONE OF THESE  VIDEOS FOR MYSELF.
DISGUSTING. I MEAN HAND HELD CAMERAS  LITERALLY GIVE ME VERTIGO.
IS THAT A RAT? YEAH, THAT'S A RAT. BUT IT WAS THE ABUSE THAT I  DIDN'T SEE THAT WAS TRULY  DISTURBING.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT VIDEOS VIDEOS THAT  HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EDITED  MANIPULATED.
WE EDIT THE FOOTAGE BECAUSE  MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WATCH  HOURS OF ANIMAL CRUELTY.
WE DON'T EDIT [BLEEP]. HOW DARE YOU. AS MEREDITH POINTS OUT, THESE  LAWS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY  PROTECT THE DEFENSELESS AGAINST THE BLIND INTERESTS OF BIG  BUSINESS.
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT PROFITS. THESE VIDEOS ARE HOW THEY RAISE  FUNDS AND HOW THEY KEEP DOING  WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
SO IT'S THE ACTIVISTS THAT  ARE CONNECTED WITH THE BOTTOM  LINE NOT THE FARMERS.
YES. THE ANIMAL ACTIVIST INDUSTRY IS  A HUGE BUSINESS.
ANIMAL ACTIVISM IS A HUGE  BUSINESS. ONE THAT IS ALMOST SOMEWHAT  COMPLETELY DWARFED BY THE U.S. AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. BUT THE PROBLEM WITH WHISTLE  BLOWING IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO  WANT TO HEAR THE WHISTLE.
I THINK I SPEAK FOR THE  MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHEN I SAY  I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT  ANIMAL WELFARE, THESE ARE LAWS  THAT ARE FLAGRANTLY  UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THEY'RE DESIGNED TO SHUT DOWN  YOUR ABILITY TO KNOW HOW THINGS  ARE HAPPENING.
YOU'RE THE GUY WALKING AROUND  TELLING EVERYBODY THERE'S PEE IN  THE POOL. I KNOW THERE'S PEE IN THE POOL. I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT IS ME. I JUST WANT CHEESE ON IT. EAT IT. GET THE [BLEEP] OUT OF THERE.
WHAT DO AMERICANS REALLY  WANT? CHEAP, HOT MEAT. NO MATTER HOW WE GET IT.
YOU THINK THESE ARE GOOD? YOU SHOULD TRY PORK RINDS.
AL MADRIGAL,
